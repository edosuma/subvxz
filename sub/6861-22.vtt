WEBVTT

00:01.869 --> 00:03.337
I cannot tell you
how sorry I am.

00:03.337 --> 00:06.140
Zoe Hart has flipped
 some New York switch in you

00:06.140 --> 00:07.875
and you are just not
the same person anymore.

00:07.875 --> 00:10.611
Wade likes you. I don't want
to see him get hurt.

00:10.611 --> 00:12.613
You never wanted to help me.
The only thing you want his him.

00:12.613 --> 00:14.782
Well, let me tell you
something, Zoe Hart,

00:14.782 --> 00:16.450
George Tucker and Lemon Breeland
are getting married.

00:16.450 --> 00:19.187
We owe it to each other to try
and make this thing work.

00:19.187 --> 00:21.455
Because you love her.
I do.

00:39.240 --> 00:42.243
We are gathered
together tonight

00:42.243 --> 00:45.213
to join this man
and these women...

00:55.356 --> 00:58.626
...and this other guy.

01:08.102 --> 01:09.370
Wait, no.

01:09.370 --> 01:10.838
There's been some mistake here.

01:10.838 --> 01:12.106
(phone ringing)

01:12.106 --> 01:13.674
There's been a mistake!

01:13.674 --> 01:15.075
(gasping)

01:15.075 --> 01:17.345
(ringing continues)

01:19.147 --> 01:20.681
Uh...

01:20.681 --> 01:22.283
Oh.

01:22.283 --> 01:24.552
Baby, baby, hi.
Uh, good morning.

01:24.552 --> 01:26.287
LEMON:
Today I'm the luckiest girl

01:26.287 --> 01:27.721
in the entire world.

01:27.721 --> 01:28.989
I love you.

01:28.989 --> 01:30.491
I love you, too.

01:30.491 --> 01:32.426
Babe, I actually
really want to see you.

01:32.426 --> 01:34.428
You want to get breakfast
or something?
(laughs) Silly.

01:34.428 --> 01:36.864
A groom's not allowed to see
the bride before the wedding.

01:36.864 --> 01:38.031
Yeah.

01:38.031 --> 01:39.167
You're completely right.

01:39.167 --> 01:40.401
That's silly of me. Sorry.

01:40.401 --> 01:42.170
But, um,
if you're running out,

01:42.170 --> 01:43.971
do you think you could
do me a huge favor?

01:43.971 --> 01:45.373
Uh-huh.
Make sure to find Donald

01:45.373 --> 01:47.441
and make sure
he has enough lilies

01:47.441 --> 01:49.009
to mix with the camellias--
there's suppose to be

01:49.009 --> 01:50.711
a three to two ratio.
Okay, uh...

01:50.711 --> 01:51.879
All right, three...

01:51.879 --> 01:54.515
Three to two lilies.
All right.

01:54.515 --> 01:56.049
Yeah, and can you make sure
that he has them there

01:56.049 --> 01:57.518
about ten to five.

01:57.518 --> 01:59.420
Ten to five.

01:59.420 --> 02:00.554
With some extra
arrangements maybe.

02:00.554 --> 02:02.523
I don't know,
like five to ten.

02:02.523 --> 02:05.993
Three to two, ten to five,
and five to ten.

02:05.993 --> 02:08.162
I'll see you at 8:00.

02:08.162 --> 02:09.729
I'll be the one in white.

02:09.729 --> 02:11.732
Okay.

02:12.766 --> 02:15.135
(sighs)

02:43.364 --> 02:45.766
(electrical crackling)

02:46.934 --> 02:48.168
WADE:
Damn it, Zoe!

02:55.209 --> 02:57.110
You blew out
my damn electricity again.

02:57.110 --> 02:58.111
Sorry about that.

02:58.111 --> 02:59.447
I got a new coffeemaker.

02:59.447 --> 03:01.382
I made you a cup.

03:04.618 --> 03:06.220
What's that smell like?

03:06.220 --> 03:07.588
crème brulée.

03:08.656 --> 03:12.260
Look, Wade, I was hoping
that we could talk.

03:12.260 --> 03:16.129
You've been avoiding me ever
since I decided to stay in town.

03:16.129 --> 03:17.898
That's 'cause I hate you.

03:17.898 --> 03:19.800
Which is exactly what
I want to rectify.

03:19.800 --> 03:23.136
Look, I'm really sorry that I
lost you at the BlueBell Battle.

03:23.136 --> 03:25.373
I messed up.
I really did.

03:25.373 --> 03:29.076
Can we please just sit,
chat, move passed this?

03:29.076 --> 03:32.413
No, no, and, uh...
(clears throat)

03:32.413 --> 03:33.981
when pigs fly.

03:33.981 --> 03:35.115
(grunts)

03:35.115 --> 03:36.784
Wade, you are one
of the only people

03:36.784 --> 03:38.952
in this town that's
been there for me.

03:38.952 --> 03:42.656
I'm realizing that living here
is not going to be easy.

03:42.656 --> 03:44.492
I could really use
every friend that I have.

03:44.492 --> 03:46.860
Yeah, well, you should have
thought about that before
you lost me my bar.

03:49.830 --> 03:52.500
Coffee shouldn't taste
like a pastry.

04:04.044 --> 04:05.946
(swan squawks)

04:13.721 --> 04:15.356
Great, Donald,
thank you so much.

04:15.356 --> 04:16.457
Everything's going
to be fantastic.

04:16.457 --> 04:20.192
Appreciate it.

04:20.192 --> 04:21.329
Oh, hey. (chuckles)

04:21.329 --> 04:23.297
Hey.
George.

04:23.297 --> 04:24.698
Big day, huh?
Uh, yeah.

04:24.698 --> 04:26.467
Sorry about all this.
Seems like we're trying

04:26.467 --> 04:27.468
to take over the whole town.

04:27.468 --> 04:28.969
Oh, no, it's fine.

04:28.969 --> 04:30.371
It's so festive.

04:30.371 --> 04:32.740
I just, I'm sorry, I haven't
gotten you a present yet.

04:32.740 --> 04:34.141
Zoe, you don't have
to get us a gift.

04:34.141 --> 04:35.343
I have a year though, right?

04:35.343 --> 04:37.478
I will find you
the perfect thing.

04:37.478 --> 04:38.779
Seriously, don't worry about it,

04:38.779 --> 04:40.814
'cause, I mean,
by the end of the summer,

04:40.814 --> 04:43.317
you'll be back up
in New York,

04:43.317 --> 04:44.352
a happy surgeon again, right?

04:44.352 --> 04:45.486
And this whole BlueBell thing

04:45.486 --> 04:48.288
will seem like
a strange dream, so...

04:48.288 --> 04:50.358
Uh, George, I
thought you knew.

04:50.358 --> 04:51.825
I decided to stay.

04:55.262 --> 04:57.097
Uh, stay...

04:57.097 --> 05:00.868
as in... for, for good?

05:00.868 --> 05:02.803
Don't worry.
You know, I won't

05:02.803 --> 05:04.505
make anything
difficult for you.

05:04.505 --> 05:05.806
I-I will live my life,

05:05.806 --> 05:08.909
and you and Lemon
will live yours.

05:08.909 --> 05:11.645
And we will find
a way to coexist.

05:11.645 --> 05:12.980
Yeah.

05:12.980 --> 05:16.850
And every day from here on
out will get easier, right?

05:16.850 --> 05:18.051
Yeah.

05:18.051 --> 05:19.987
Oh! Excuse me.
Oh! Um...

05:19.987 --> 05:21.088
Sorry, uh...

05:21.088 --> 05:23.391
Just all the way,
just way back in the corner.

05:23.391 --> 05:24.925
Over there
by the hydrangea.

05:24.925 --> 05:26.193
Hey, Lavon.

05:26.193 --> 05:28.529
Out of the way.
Swans coming through.
(Zoe shrieks)

05:28.529 --> 05:29.763
LAVON:
Uh, George, George.

05:29.763 --> 05:31.499
As the mayor,
I have to tell you,

05:31.499 --> 05:33.367
if those swans bite someone,
the city's liable.

05:33.367 --> 05:35.268
You have to get rid
of those.

05:35.268 --> 05:36.537
This from a man
with a pet alligator.

05:36.537 --> 05:39.873
The swans?
Lavon, seriously?

05:43.276 --> 05:46.013
Come with me.
Mm-hm.

05:46.013 --> 05:48.115
(squawking)

05:48.115 --> 05:49.550
You okay?

05:49.550 --> 05:51.552
I told George I was staying,

05:51.552 --> 05:53.687
and he looked like
he was going to throw up.

05:53.687 --> 05:56.790
No, no, it's a good thing.

05:56.790 --> 06:00.561
He was upset because he still
has feelings for me.

06:00.561 --> 06:03.063
I just know that
in romantic comedies,

06:03.063 --> 06:06.434
there's always someone marrying
someone that they shouldn't

06:06.434 --> 06:07.635
while everyone
is waiting breathlessly

06:07.635 --> 06:09.603
for the one
that they truly love

06:09.603 --> 06:12.873
to show up at the church
and say, "I object!"

06:12.873 --> 06:13.841
Oh, no.

06:13.841 --> 06:15.375
That is exactly
what I am going to do.

06:15.375 --> 06:16.677
I'm going to say,
"I object!"

06:16.677 --> 06:18.846
That's a good idea, right?

06:18.846 --> 06:20.047
No, no, no.

06:20.047 --> 06:22.583
Look, Zoe, he chose Lemon.

06:22.583 --> 06:24.184
Now you show up
at their wedding,

06:24.184 --> 06:25.519
he's going to chose her again.

06:25.519 --> 06:27.555
It's going to be painful
and a humiliation

06:27.555 --> 06:28.989
from which you
will not recover.

06:28.989 --> 06:31.191
I don't know,
I've recovered from a lot.

06:31.191 --> 06:33.060
Zoe...
(sighs)

06:33.060 --> 06:35.095
You're right.

06:35.095 --> 06:36.497
I know you're right.

06:36.497 --> 06:39.066
Which is why you're going to
take my car and go to Mobile.

06:39.066 --> 06:42.002
All right? Go shopping,
see some non-romantic movies.

06:42.002 --> 06:44.472
Ceremony starts at 8:00.

06:44.472 --> 06:46.073
You are not allowed to
enter BlueBell, Alabama

06:46.073 --> 06:47.475
till at least 9:00.

06:47.475 --> 06:49.076
Lavon Hayes is its mayor,

06:49.076 --> 06:51.078
well, he can make
those sort of rules.

06:52.079 --> 06:54.014
Restraining order.
Yeah.

06:55.048 --> 06:56.416
Oh, your husband cheated?

06:56.416 --> 06:57.685
I am just shocked.

06:57.685 --> 07:00.921
Honestly, started over
is exciting, you know?

07:00.921 --> 07:04.091
Just going to get an apartment,
maybe even in Mobile.

07:04.091 --> 07:06.494
Gonna go back to school.

07:06.494 --> 07:07.628
(women exclaiming)

07:07.628 --> 07:09.697
There's our
glowing bride!

07:09.697 --> 07:11.599
(women exclaiming)

07:11.599 --> 07:13.501
Oh, honey, what's wrong?

07:13.501 --> 07:15.503
What is wrong?

07:15.503 --> 07:17.437
Do you not see
this monstrosity on my face?

07:17.437 --> 07:19.439
There is nothing
even there.

07:19.439 --> 07:21.308
It is all in
your head.

07:21.308 --> 07:23.310
It's a teeny pimple.
We can cover that right up.

07:23.310 --> 07:24.912
Don't you worry
about anything.

07:24.912 --> 07:26.246
(laughs)

07:26.246 --> 07:28.415
CLORA:
Hello, darlings.

07:28.415 --> 07:29.883
Oh, I am so excited.

07:29.883 --> 07:31.785
And don't you
look gorgeous.

07:31.785 --> 07:33.186
Oh...

07:33.186 --> 07:35.723
And don't worry, with your veil
over your face,

07:35.723 --> 07:38.358
no one will see
that thing on your chin.

07:38.358 --> 07:39.527
Is there any coffee?

07:39.527 --> 07:42.195
You know what,
let's get a mimosa!

07:42.195 --> 07:45.265
Oh! Have a good time.

07:45.265 --> 07:47.067
(squawking)

07:47.067 --> 07:48.936
* *

07:52.139 --> 07:53.741
Lavon, we have an emergency.

07:53.741 --> 07:56.877
What is it?
My knee, it's tingling.

08:00.013 --> 08:01.715
No. Are you sure?

08:01.715 --> 08:02.716
Of course I'm sure.

08:02.716 --> 08:04.251
And what's worse,

08:04.251 --> 08:07.555
I just saw Rita Urban's rooster
lying down in the barn.

08:07.555 --> 08:09.256
No...

08:09.256 --> 08:12.025
No...

08:12.025 --> 08:13.226
No!

08:13.226 --> 08:15.896
Hey, Wade.

08:15.896 --> 08:18.365
Old pal.

08:18.365 --> 08:19.767
Have you seen
Lavon's car keys?

08:19.767 --> 08:21.569
I got 'em,
but my alternator's busted

08:21.569 --> 08:23.070
and I got an appointment.

08:23.070 --> 08:26.707
Well, I'm sure that your
appointment is very important,

08:26.707 --> 08:30.243
but I have a medical
emergency in Mobile.

08:30.243 --> 08:32.279
My patient is very sick.

08:32.279 --> 08:33.547
Peritonsillar abscess.

08:33.547 --> 08:35.248
And, um...

08:35.248 --> 08:37.551
I really have to go because
every moment I'm here,

08:37.551 --> 08:38.719
it's just making things worse,

08:38.719 --> 08:40.921
so can I please
have those keys?

08:48.328 --> 08:50.731
(squawks)

08:50.731 --> 08:52.432
LAVON:
Hey, George?

08:52.432 --> 08:53.466
What now?

08:53.466 --> 08:54.835
Oh, there's a city ordinance

08:54.835 --> 08:56.269
that says
I can't have flowers, right?

08:56.269 --> 08:58.706
I know how it must look to
you, but we have a problem.

08:58.706 --> 08:59.807
Tom Long's knee is tingling.

08:59.807 --> 09:01.341
What are you
talking about?

09:01.341 --> 09:03.577
I know it sounds crazy, but just
before the last six squalls,

09:03.577 --> 09:05.545
there have been four signs.

09:05.545 --> 09:06.814
First, Tom's knee tingles,

09:06.814 --> 09:07.981
then the roosters lie down,

09:07.981 --> 09:09.282
then the pelicans fly inland,

09:09.282 --> 09:11.284
then Chuck Mimoun, the
weatherman on channel 4,

09:11.284 --> 09:13.621
says there's going to be a
storm. Then, bam, storm!

09:13.621 --> 09:16.023
Lavon, weatherman said
nothing about a storm.

09:16.023 --> 09:18.692
Believe me,
a storm is coming:

09:18.692 --> 09:20.193
lightning, thunder, wind.

09:20.193 --> 09:21.762
It is not going to be
safe to be outdoors.

09:21.762 --> 09:24.097
We have to
postpone the wedding.

09:25.165 --> 09:26.499
This is sad, Lavon.

09:26.499 --> 09:28.501
It is.
You need help.

09:28.501 --> 09:30.638
You need some
serious help.

09:31.739 --> 09:34.174
(swan squawking)

09:34.174 --> 09:37.310
(car horn honks)

09:37.310 --> 09:41.481
(seagulls calling)

09:41.481 --> 09:43.884
(birds singing)

09:47.154 --> 09:48.689
Where you in from,
sweet little thing?

09:48.689 --> 09:50.624
BlueBell via New York.

09:50.624 --> 09:52.092
You're kidding?
Why would you leave?

09:52.092 --> 09:55.095
Oh, well, um, I didn't get
the surgical fellowship,

09:55.095 --> 09:57.765
and there was this man
I didn't know was dad.

09:57.765 --> 09:58.999
I mean, why would you
leave BlueBell?

09:58.999 --> 10:00.868
Don't you know
today is the day that

10:00.868 --> 10:02.636
the Breeland girl
marries the Tucker boy?

10:02.636 --> 10:04.672
Ooh, it's like a
Southern royal wedding.

10:04.672 --> 10:06.807
I made a commemorative plate.

10:06.807 --> 10:09.042
(cell phone rings)
Ooh.

10:09.042 --> 10:10.844
Hey, Lavon.

10:10.844 --> 10:13.346
Excuse me.
That's fine.

10:13.346 --> 10:15.148
I'm in Mobile, okay?

10:15.148 --> 10:17.384
You don't have
to check up on me.

10:17.384 --> 10:18.719
We have a bit
of a situation.

10:18.719 --> 10:19.787
A storm is coming and by the

10:19.787 --> 10:21.321
looks of things,
it could be bad.

10:21.321 --> 10:23.023
What, do you think the wedding's
going to be cancelled?

10:23.023 --> 10:24.725
Though Lavon Hayes wants nothing
more than for all of this

10:24.725 --> 10:26.593
to be behind him,
mayor can't let it happen,

10:26.593 --> 10:27.728
not in this storm.

10:27.728 --> 10:29.196
Great, then I can come back.

10:29.196 --> 10:30.597
Oh, you still need
to stay away.

10:30.597 --> 10:32.399
I still need to convince
everyone first.

10:32.399 --> 10:34.501
At least now
you have company.
Huh? Who?

10:34.501 --> 10:36.569
Wade's car broke down
on the side of Gulf Road.

10:36.569 --> 10:37.905
Now, I can't leave, so,

10:37.905 --> 10:39.873
I need you to pick him up
before the storm hits.

10:39.873 --> 10:41.274
And then what,
take him shoe shopping?

10:41.274 --> 10:43.476
Look, Lavon,
despite my best efforts,

10:43.476 --> 10:44.745
Wade still hates me.

10:44.745 --> 10:46.413
Well, uh, think of this
as your opportunity

10:46.413 --> 10:47.580
to work out your crap.

10:47.580 --> 10:49.282
(sighs)

10:50.851 --> 10:53.286
My skin was flawless
on my wedding day.

10:53.286 --> 10:55.588
They wrote about it
in Southern Living.

10:55.588 --> 10:57.524
Green, AnnaBeth,
at your age?

10:57.524 --> 10:59.760
It's fashionable, and
I'm a single girl now.

10:59.760 --> 11:01.762
Are you really ready
to be out there again?

11:01.762 --> 11:03.697
I can't wait.

11:03.697 --> 11:05.098
Truth be told,

11:05.098 --> 11:06.934
in bedroom matters,
Jake had all the touch

11:06.934 --> 11:08.702
of a plumber
unclogging a sink.

11:08.702 --> 11:11.038
Uh-uh.
Oh...

11:11.038 --> 11:14.341
I hope the mayor's still
available when I'm divorced!

11:14.341 --> 11:15.709
Lavon Hayes is delicious.

11:15.709 --> 11:17.010
CRICKETT:
So hot.

11:17.010 --> 11:18.645
I'd like to butter his biscuit.
Magnolia!

11:18.645 --> 11:20.113
What? He looks like a man

11:20.113 --> 11:21.915
who enjoys
a nice dairy spread

11:21.915 --> 11:23.851
on his bread
products.

11:23.851 --> 11:26.386
(all gasping)

11:27.955 --> 11:29.256
No.

11:29.256 --> 11:31.925
Please tell me you did not
just spill a mimosa

11:31.925 --> 11:34.094
all over my Monique Lhuillier
wedding gown.

11:35.462 --> 11:36.496
It's your family.

11:36.496 --> 11:37.597
Why on Earth
would I pay

11:37.597 --> 11:38.799
for their
bed-and-breakfast stay?

11:38.799 --> 11:40.067
Well, I assume,
when one foots the bill

11:40.067 --> 11:41.301
for a wedding,
one foots the entire bill.

11:41.301 --> 11:42.936
The way you Breelands
throw money around

11:42.936 --> 11:44.604
like it's birdseed,
I figured it was no big deal.

11:44.604 --> 11:46.239
Oh, we throw it
around? Birdseed?
Hey, guys, guys.

11:46.239 --> 11:47.941
Of course,
if you can't afford it,
Dad, Dad.

11:47.941 --> 11:49.409
now, I'll...
Brick. Hey, hey.

11:49.409 --> 11:52.179
We're going to go have
a peaceful 18 holes of golf.

11:52.179 --> 11:53.480
George.

11:53.480 --> 11:55.816
Uh... son?
What?

11:58.685 --> 12:00.420
No, no, no, no, no.

12:00.420 --> 12:03.056
Uh, Bill, what the
hell is going on here?

12:03.056 --> 12:05.192
George, uh,
I thought you knew.
Knew what?

12:05.192 --> 12:06.960
The mayor revoked your permit
to use the town square.

12:06.960 --> 12:08.628
BRICK:
What? Why would he do that?

12:08.628 --> 12:10.163
There must be some mistake.
GEORGE:
No, no, you know,

12:10.163 --> 12:12.065
you guys go
and head down to the club.

12:12.065 --> 12:13.767
I'll meet you there
in a little bit.

12:13.767 --> 12:16.103
After I kill the mayor.

12:16.937 --> 12:18.605
He... he didn't mean that.

12:18.605 --> 12:20.240
Uh, just a figure of speech.

12:24.177 --> 12:25.846
(horn honking)

12:26.679 --> 12:28.081
Hey...

12:29.783 --> 12:30.918
Wadester.

12:30.918 --> 12:33.253
I called Lavon.

12:33.253 --> 12:35.622
Yes, well,
unfortunately, he's busy.

12:35.622 --> 12:37.190
There's a big storm on the way,

12:37.190 --> 12:39.192
so I'm here
to give you a ride.

12:39.192 --> 12:40.460
Go away.

12:40.460 --> 12:43.130
(sighs)

12:43.130 --> 12:45.198
Look, I promised Lavon, okay?

12:45.198 --> 12:48.869
So I am just going to sit here
until you get in the car.

12:48.869 --> 12:50.370
Staring at you.

12:51.604 --> 12:53.473
Sitting, waiting.

12:53.473 --> 12:55.976
* Staring and waiting *

12:55.976 --> 12:58.078
* I'm staring *

12:58.078 --> 12:59.779
* And waiting... *
All right, fine!

12:59.779 --> 13:00.981
Okay?

13:00.981 --> 13:02.549
I'll ride with you.

13:02.549 --> 13:04.251
So you can stop singing.

13:08.088 --> 13:09.890
What the hell is wrong with you?

13:09.890 --> 13:11.091
Look, I tried
to talk to you.

13:11.091 --> 13:12.425
I had no choice, okay?

13:12.425 --> 13:14.061
It's a public
safety issue.
Oh, come on.

13:14.061 --> 13:15.996
Just admit that you are doing
everything in your power

13:15.996 --> 13:17.564
to keep Lemon and me from
getting married today.

13:17.564 --> 13:19.833
Oh, come... believe me,
I want this wedding to happen.

13:19.833 --> 13:21.301
Okay? On another day.

13:21.301 --> 13:23.904
And that is so believable
coming from the mouth of a man

13:23.904 --> 13:26.306
who lied to my face
for a year and a half.

13:26.306 --> 13:28.308
(thunder crashing)

13:38.318 --> 13:40.620
WADE:
 Where are you going?

13:40.620 --> 13:41.788
This isn't the way home.

13:41.788 --> 13:42.956
It's the back way to Mobile.

13:42.956 --> 13:45.058
I thought, you know,
we could hang out,

13:45.058 --> 13:46.459
maybe see a rainy day movie.

13:46.459 --> 13:48.195
Or bowl. I have
never bowled before,

13:48.195 --> 13:49.196
but I am willing to try.

13:49.196 --> 13:51.298
Are you insane?
Turn around.

13:51.298 --> 13:53.433
Look, I-I know this is
your first one of these storms,

13:53.433 --> 13:55.435
but we shouldn't
be driving in this.

13:55.435 --> 13:57.470
Come on. It's just
a little rain.

13:58.671 --> 14:02.109
Look, Wade, how long
are you going to hold a grudge?

14:02.109 --> 14:03.710
We live in the same house.

14:03.710 --> 14:05.012
We share a kitchen.

14:05.012 --> 14:07.214
I'm working on correcting
that situation.

14:07.214 --> 14:08.448
Before my car
broke down,

14:08.448 --> 14:10.717
I was on my way
to check out an apartment.

14:10.717 --> 14:11.919
I'm moving off the plantation.

14:11.919 --> 14:12.953
What?

14:12.953 --> 14:14.221
(thunder crashes)

14:14.221 --> 14:15.488
Look, Dr. Manhattan,
in about three minutes,

14:15.488 --> 14:17.157
there's going to be
more lightning

14:17.157 --> 14:19.059
than you've ever seen before,
so just turn us around

14:19.059 --> 14:20.227
and get us back to BlueBell.

14:20.227 --> 14:22.462
I can't.
I cannot turn around.

14:24.831 --> 14:26.266
(tires squeal)

14:28.168 --> 14:29.502
Okay, maybe I
can turn around.

14:29.502 --> 14:30.938
It's too late now.

14:30.938 --> 14:32.105
This storm's
kicking up fast.

14:32.105 --> 14:33.806
We need to get
to that barn back there.

14:33.806 --> 14:35.275
I am not scared of
a little lightning.

14:35.275 --> 14:36.609
That's 'cause,
in New York,

14:36.609 --> 14:38.145
you were surrounded
by 100-story lightning rods.

14:38.145 --> 14:40.113
Next tree that comes down
could be on this car.

14:40.113 --> 14:41.581
It's up to you, Doc.

14:45.518 --> 14:47.220
(thunder crashes)

14:48.588 --> 14:50.257
(Zoe screams)

14:51.458 --> 14:52.993
Wait for me!

14:56.729 --> 14:57.965
(thunder rumbling)

14:57.965 --> 14:59.232
(turns on music)

14:59.232 --> 15:00.633
Let's dance. Whoo!

15:00.633 --> 15:03.136
Crickett, this is no time
for a dance party.

15:03.136 --> 15:05.238
We still have to work
to get this spot out.

15:05.238 --> 15:07.140
My God, what else
can happen to me today?

15:07.140 --> 15:08.375
It's less than
six hours

15:08.375 --> 15:09.476
to my wedding,
and I still

15:09.476 --> 15:10.877
haven't even done
my hair yet.

15:10.877 --> 15:12.812
And the wedding's
going to be great!

15:12.812 --> 15:14.014
(gasps)

15:14.881 --> 15:17.250
Whoo! Just my
flash photography.

15:17.250 --> 15:18.351
Smile!

15:18.351 --> 15:20.020
Crickett, stop.
What are you doing?

15:20.020 --> 15:21.621
(thunder rumbles)
(gasps) What was that?

15:21.621 --> 15:24.291
What? I did not hear anything.

15:26.093 --> 15:28.261
No, no, no, no,
no, no, no.

15:30.497 --> 15:31.498
(screams)

15:31.498 --> 15:33.066
(bleating)

15:36.903 --> 15:38.305
Wade?

15:38.305 --> 15:40.607
Are we really going to sit
in silence

15:40.607 --> 15:41.975
for the next six hours?

15:41.975 --> 15:43.510
You know, we're
going to be

15:43.510 --> 15:44.777
in here for a while.

15:44.777 --> 15:47.114
We... we should play a game!

15:47.114 --> 15:49.582
Like 20 questions or ghost.

15:49.582 --> 15:52.152
You know, any game with
talking would be fine.

15:53.987 --> 15:56.456
Look, Wade...

15:56.456 --> 15:59.792
I feel horrible
that you hate me so much

15:59.792 --> 16:01.294
you want to move
out of your house.

16:01.294 --> 16:03.330
So just... just tell me
what I have to do

16:03.330 --> 16:04.797
to make us friends again.

16:04.797 --> 16:06.033
That's the thing.

16:06.033 --> 16:08.535
You and me--
we were never friends.

16:08.535 --> 16:09.802
Yes, we were.

16:09.802 --> 16:10.903
Look, maybe we
weren't besties,

16:10.903 --> 16:13.673
but we shared some moments,

16:13.673 --> 16:15.675
some laughs.

16:15.675 --> 16:16.676
Come on.

16:16.676 --> 16:17.810
I'm funny.

16:17.810 --> 16:18.945
I'm fun!

16:18.945 --> 16:20.280
I can tap dance.

16:21.681 --> 16:24.284
Whoo!

16:25.618 --> 16:27.954
I can see through your shirt
when you do that.

16:27.954 --> 16:30.290
Shut up.
Oh, does it help?

16:30.290 --> 16:31.558
No.

16:31.558 --> 16:33.460
(laughs)

16:33.460 --> 16:35.228
I'm hungry.

16:35.228 --> 16:36.363
Are you hungry?

16:36.363 --> 16:38.398
You know, Lavon
has some candy

16:38.398 --> 16:39.832
in his glove
compartment,

16:39.832 --> 16:41.834
and I will go out
there and get it

16:41.834 --> 16:43.236
just to show you that I care.

16:43.236 --> 16:45.305
And my shirt
will get even more wet.

16:45.305 --> 16:47.374
Don't, okay?
Don't worry.

16:49.042 --> 16:50.143
Oh, wait. Baby goat.

16:50.143 --> 16:51.611
Wait!
Just sit down

16:51.611 --> 16:53.846
No, Wade!
and be quiet before
you endanger the lives

16:53.846 --> 16:55.782
of somebody else!

17:11.564 --> 17:13.165
Do you remember
when we were kids

17:13.165 --> 17:15.568
and we used to try on
our mothers' wedding gowns

17:15.568 --> 17:17.404
and take turns
marrying the dog?

17:17.404 --> 17:19.539
Yeah. That dog
turned out to be

17:19.539 --> 17:21.174
more loyal than my
actual husband.

17:21.174 --> 17:22.642
(chuckles)

17:22.642 --> 17:23.742
I have spent

17:23.742 --> 17:26.546
months and months
of work into this day,

17:26.546 --> 17:30.850
and now it's just...
washing away.

17:30.850 --> 17:32.285
My wedding day
was perfect,

17:32.285 --> 17:33.986
and look what
happened to me.

17:33.986 --> 17:35.822
What's that
supposed to mean?

17:35.822 --> 17:37.490
Just that a
wedding is one day

17:37.490 --> 17:39.058
out of what's supposed
to be a lifetime.

17:39.058 --> 17:41.161
So you're saying,
if I can't make my wedding work,

17:41.161 --> 17:42.429
then I can't make
my marriage work?

17:42.429 --> 17:43.830
That's not what
I meant at all.

17:43.830 --> 17:45.031
I mean, because
all day long,

17:45.031 --> 17:46.266
all you've been
talking about is how

17:46.266 --> 17:47.700
you can't wait
to be a single woman.

17:47.700 --> 17:49.936
Well, I don't want to be
a single woman, AnnaBeth.

17:49.936 --> 17:52.172
I didn't say that you did.
But you did spill your drink
all over my wedding dress.

17:52.172 --> 17:54.073
Are you saying I did
that on purpose?

17:56.042 --> 17:58.445
You're exactly right, Lemon.

17:58.445 --> 18:00.580
And not only that--
I drove Jake

18:00.580 --> 18:02.782
into the arms of a
Baton Rouge waitress

18:02.782 --> 18:05.985
just so that I could use
my evil divorcée mojo

18:05.985 --> 18:08.288
to make it rain, too.

18:12.692 --> 18:14.161
Well, it's looking
like this storm's

18:14.161 --> 18:15.395
going to go through the night.

18:15.395 --> 18:17.664
I'm never going to
get my deposit back.

18:17.664 --> 18:19.031
I mean, all that food.

18:19.031 --> 18:20.300
And, you know, flowers--

18:20.300 --> 18:22.802
they were flown in
from South America.

18:22.802 --> 18:24.737
And the swans.

18:24.737 --> 18:27.474
You know how much those swans
are costing me? Look at that.

18:27.474 --> 18:29.276
Brick, there's more
to worry about than money.

18:29.276 --> 18:31.744
Like my poor cousins,
who took three planes

18:31.744 --> 18:33.413
from North Carolina,
and now they're stuck

18:33.413 --> 18:35.081
at the Whippoorwill
Blossom Inn

18:35.081 --> 18:37.150
until we find a solution
to all this.

18:37.150 --> 18:38.551
It could take days.

18:38.551 --> 18:40.753
Days. You know what?
I am not paying for that.

18:40.753 --> 18:42.722
No, I don't care who
they are. I'm not... No.

18:42.722 --> 18:43.890
Hey, guys.
Hey.

18:43.890 --> 18:46.159
I-I-I feel terrible
about this weather situation.

18:46.159 --> 18:48.761
And I-I want to offer
to help any way I can.

18:48.761 --> 18:50.330
Look, how about moving the...
the wedding inside?

18:50.330 --> 18:51.331
I mean,
you might be able

18:51.331 --> 18:52.499
to fit that many people

18:52.499 --> 18:53.533
in the library
or-or the old firehouse.

18:53.533 --> 18:55.034
Thanks, Lavon, but, you know,

18:55.034 --> 18:56.203
Lemon has been preparing

18:56.203 --> 18:57.404
her perfect wedding
under the stars

18:57.404 --> 18:58.771
for the last year and a half.

18:58.771 --> 19:01.341
I just... I don't want
her to compromise.

19:03.343 --> 19:05.478
I'll go tell her
we're going to postpone.

19:05.478 --> 19:07.714
She's going to be
so disappointed.

19:07.714 --> 19:09.882
No, Brick, wait.

19:11.050 --> 19:12.252
Lemon, honey,
it's me.

19:12.252 --> 19:15.222
Uh, I just want
to let you know that,

19:15.222 --> 19:19.926
come hell or even higher water,
we are getting married today.

19:19.926 --> 19:20.993
It may not be outside,

19:20.993 --> 19:22.495
it may not be
under the stars,

19:22.495 --> 19:25.298
but, baby, I promise you
it is going to be perfect.

19:25.298 --> 19:27.334
Okay? I love you.

19:27.334 --> 19:29.269
(bleating)
ZOE:
Daddy goat,

19:29.269 --> 19:31.338
as soon as the rain dies down,
I'm going to do

19:31.338 --> 19:32.972
everything I can
to get your baby back.

19:32.972 --> 19:34.974
I am a doctor.

19:34.974 --> 19:36.276
Which is like a veterinarian

19:36.276 --> 19:37.677
for people.

19:37.677 --> 19:39.145
(thunder crashing)

19:39.145 --> 19:41.481
This has got to nearly be
a hurricane.

19:43.516 --> 19:46.786
So, have you heard
anything about the wedding?

19:46.786 --> 19:50.189
I mean, George and Lemon
couldn't get married in this.

19:53.460 --> 19:55.962
There was no sick lady
in Mobile, was there?

19:55.962 --> 19:57.364
You took the car

19:57.364 --> 19:58.531
'cause you couldn't stand

19:58.531 --> 20:00.867
to see Goldenboy
wed his golden bride.

20:00.867 --> 20:02.769
So?

20:02.769 --> 20:04.003
Is that so wrong?

20:04.003 --> 20:06.172
Yes, it is.

20:06.172 --> 20:08.541
You know,
if you had been a grown-up

20:08.541 --> 20:09.709
and just
sucked it up

20:09.709 --> 20:11.077
like everybody else,
we wouldn't be

20:11.077 --> 20:12.178
in this situation right now.

20:12.178 --> 20:14.113
Me? I'm not the grown-up?

20:14.113 --> 20:16.849
You can't even admit
why you're really mad at me.

20:16.849 --> 20:18.285
What are you talking about?
Oh, come on.

20:18.285 --> 20:19.319
Don't make me say it.

20:19.319 --> 20:20.987
Say what?
Lavon told me.

20:23.423 --> 20:25.458
You have feelings for me

20:25.458 --> 20:26.626
that I don't.

20:26.626 --> 20:28.328
I know it,
you know it,

20:28.328 --> 20:29.762
and that's what this
is all about.

20:36.803 --> 20:38.805
Wade...

20:38.805 --> 20:40.640
Wade!

20:55.722 --> 20:59.626
I'm all alone in a barn
in a storm.

20:59.626 --> 21:01.328
(bleats)
With some goats.

21:01.328 --> 21:02.462
Where's Wade?

21:02.462 --> 21:04.263
I tried to apologize
and-and be nice,

21:04.263 --> 21:06.933
and then things took a turn
and he left.

21:06.933 --> 21:08.368
With the car?

21:08.368 --> 21:09.502
My guess is yes.

21:09.502 --> 21:10.770
And then there are some goats,

21:10.770 --> 21:12.439
who I think are mad at me, too.

21:12.439 --> 21:13.540
You want me to send someone

21:13.540 --> 21:15.475
to get you?
No. No, you can't.

21:15.475 --> 21:17.209
I can't be in town
for the wedding.

21:17.209 --> 21:19.078
Just four more hours.

21:19.078 --> 21:20.980
Bye.

21:25.552 --> 21:26.986
I thought you left me here!

21:26.986 --> 21:28.621
I considered it.

21:28.621 --> 21:31.324
Then I decided I needed
to clear the air.

21:34.327 --> 21:36.329
See, Lavon was right.

21:36.329 --> 21:38.064
I did like you.

21:39.298 --> 21:40.299
You're plaguing me,

21:40.299 --> 21:41.668
walking around

21:41.668 --> 21:44.236
in your little outfits,
smiling.

21:44.236 --> 21:46.739
It confused my feelings.

21:46.739 --> 21:48.007
But now I see

21:48.007 --> 21:50.443
those feelings...

21:50.443 --> 21:52.579
it was just, uh...

21:52.579 --> 21:55.548
well, it was just
sexual frustration.

21:55.548 --> 21:57.249
Oh, come on.
You see,

21:57.249 --> 22:00.753
you were the first and only girl
I couldn't get to sleep with me,

22:00.753 --> 22:01.554
and it...

22:01.554 --> 22:02.855
it messed up my mind.

22:02.855 --> 22:05.458
It got me deluded
so I was thinking

22:05.458 --> 22:07.694
that you were like this, uh,

22:07.694 --> 22:11.698
this like Holy Grail,
which, sweetie, you are not.

22:11.698 --> 22:13.566
Thank you.
See, if we had just
slept together

22:13.566 --> 22:15.935
that first night we met,

22:15.935 --> 22:19.005
I would have seen you
as the annoying,

22:19.005 --> 22:21.741
electricity-robbing neighbor
that you are.

22:21.741 --> 22:23.142
Right, yeah.

22:23.142 --> 22:26.178
And then all of this
fighting and horribleness

22:26.178 --> 22:28.581
would have been eliminated
if I had just slept with you.

22:28.581 --> 22:29.982
Then we could turn the page,

22:29.982 --> 22:32.284
if we just got it
out of our systems.

22:32.284 --> 22:34.053
Something like that.

22:34.053 --> 22:37.657
That is ridiculous.

22:37.657 --> 22:38.991
Yeah.

22:38.991 --> 22:41.894
I guess we'll never find out,
will we?

22:44.063 --> 22:45.398
(goat bleating)

22:50.603 --> 22:53.873
Well, are we gonna help
that goat or not?

22:56.075 --> 22:57.477
(knocking)

22:57.477 --> 23:00.713
Hey, um, we're
not postponing.

23:00.713 --> 23:02.281
So, can we use
the old firehouse?

23:02.281 --> 23:03.616
I need a permit
from your office.

23:03.616 --> 23:05.217
Yeah, of course.

23:05.217 --> 23:06.486
I'll, um, lend a hand.

23:06.486 --> 23:07.554
That's okay.

23:07.554 --> 23:08.988
I don't need or want your help.

23:08.988 --> 23:11.157
(thunder crashing)

23:11.157 --> 23:13.893
Look, George, I'm sorry,

23:13.893 --> 23:16.529
but you are the town lawyer,
and I'm the mayor.

23:16.529 --> 23:19.365
We will be running
into each other in town square

23:19.365 --> 23:22.635
for the rest of our lives,
I bet.

23:22.635 --> 23:26.005
So, can't we just admit
that life is complicated?

23:26.005 --> 23:28.741
Just leave it at that?

23:28.741 --> 23:31.544
Uh, it couldn't
have been easy

23:31.544 --> 23:34.547
when Zoe told you
that she was standing down.

23:37.116 --> 23:39.218
I don't know what
you're talking about.

23:39.218 --> 23:40.520
(sighs)

23:40.520 --> 23:43.790
I'm just asking
that we-we try to move on.

23:43.790 --> 23:47.460
I, for one,
would really like to.

23:52.732 --> 23:54.601
You know what, I'm-I'm
probably gonna need

23:54.601 --> 23:58.471
every single hand in town if I'm
gonna save this wedding, so...

24:02.008 --> 24:03.209
Good,

24:03.209 --> 24:05.612
'cause have you seen
the old firehouse lately?

24:18.691 --> 24:20.426
What is that smell?

24:20.426 --> 24:22.061
Incontinent Dalmatian.

24:22.061 --> 24:23.195
Yeah, poor Spot.

24:23.195 --> 24:24.330
He is 13.

24:24.330 --> 24:25.798
All right, you know
what, gentlemen,

24:25.798 --> 24:28.367
we have... we have three hours
to turn this old firehouse

24:28.367 --> 24:29.936
into a-a beautiful ballroom.

24:29.936 --> 24:31.103
How are we gonna do
all this?

24:31.103 --> 24:34.240
Harold, you forget,
this is BlueBell.

24:34.240 --> 24:35.374
Come on!
Come on in!

24:35.374 --> 24:36.976
(indistinct chattering)
Come on in.

24:36.976 --> 24:38.611
Thank you for coming.
Watch your step.

24:38.611 --> 24:40.547
How you doing?

24:40.547 --> 24:42.148
(excited chattering)

24:42.148 --> 24:45.384
REVEREND:
I'll start with this equipment
right here.

24:45.384 --> 24:47.419
DELMA:
I'll see to the flowers, George.
Yeah.

24:47.419 --> 24:49.656
I will tie up Spot.
BRICK:
There's a lot of work.

24:49.656 --> 24:51.591
So dig in anywhere.
You do that, Shelley.

24:53.292 --> 24:54.927
Thank you, everyone.

24:54.927 --> 24:56.529
What am I standing here for?

24:56.529 --> 24:57.930
Let's get...
let's get to work!

24:57.930 --> 25:00.533
* *

25:11.544 --> 25:13.012
(goat bleating)

25:13.012 --> 25:15.481
Hey, there he is.
He's trapped in the barbed wire.

25:15.481 --> 25:17.483
How am I gonna get him out?
Uh...

25:17.483 --> 25:18.985
ZOE:
Come on.

25:18.985 --> 25:19.886
Ow.

25:19.886 --> 25:21.888
Whoa, whoa,
hey, hold on.

25:21.888 --> 25:24.957
There's got to be some
better way than that.

25:24.957 --> 25:27.293
Wait.

25:29.395 --> 25:32.098
* *

25:43.776 --> 25:46.245
He's so scared.

25:48.180 --> 25:50.983
I don't think he cares
about your abs, Wade.

25:54.821 --> 25:57.289
You want to save that goat, Doc?

26:01.060 --> 26:03.062
(grunts)

26:07.433 --> 26:09.135
Okay.

26:25.685 --> 26:26.819
Here you go, mama.

26:26.819 --> 26:29.021
See? He's okay.

26:30.289 --> 26:31.457
(breathing heavily)

26:31.457 --> 26:32.692
Hey, hey, Doc,

26:32.692 --> 26:34.026
you're bleeding.

26:34.026 --> 26:36.028
What?

26:36.028 --> 26:37.830
Ow.

26:37.830 --> 26:38.998
Wait, I'll be okay.

26:38.998 --> 26:41.167
Just go get me a bandage
out of my bag.

26:41.167 --> 26:43.335
Okay, all right,
hang tight, hang tight.

26:43.335 --> 26:45.838
(goat bleats)

26:48.708 --> 26:51.177
(thunder crashing)

26:52.979 --> 26:54.747
I thought you had left.

26:54.747 --> 26:57.784
I'm not about to drive
in this storm.

27:06.659 --> 27:09.561
(sighs)

27:09.561 --> 27:12.464
Lemon,
you're my oldest friend.

27:12.464 --> 27:15.401
I wasn't trying to rub
my choices in your face.

27:15.401 --> 27:18.805
I just didn't want anyone
to feel sorry for me.

27:21.040 --> 27:24.476
AnnaBeth, I'm so sorry.

27:24.476 --> 27:27.279
I lashed out,

27:27.279 --> 27:29.115
and I know that you
had nothing to do

27:29.115 --> 27:30.783
with all the
disasters of today.

27:31.617 --> 27:33.285
Thank you.

27:35.021 --> 27:37.890
Anyway, it looks like
it's all gonna be fine.

27:37.890 --> 27:41.027
The girls said George
is moving the wedding inside.

27:41.027 --> 27:43.329
(chuckling)
Into the firehouse.

27:43.329 --> 27:44.630
See?

27:44.630 --> 27:46.799
Into the firehouse, AnnaBeth.

27:46.799 --> 27:49.168
My wedding's gonna
be in a firehouse.

27:49.168 --> 27:51.337
Yeah, okay, well,
it's not ideal.

27:52.571 --> 27:55.641
I've been working so hard,
but what's the use?

27:55.641 --> 27:58.677
What are you talking about?

28:00.679 --> 28:02.715
I made some mistakes

28:02.715 --> 28:04.016
in my relationship,

28:04.016 --> 28:08.454
some big, big ones, and...

28:08.454 --> 28:11.290
and I thought that if
I worked hard enough,

28:11.290 --> 28:14.126
or if I tried hard enough, I
could make up for everything.

28:15.694 --> 28:17.997
But truth is

28:17.997 --> 28:20.867
is I don't deserve
a perfect wedding.

28:20.867 --> 28:22.735
I really don't, and...

28:22.735 --> 28:24.703
(thunder crashes)

28:24.703 --> 28:27.139
...clearly, someone
else up there agrees.

28:29.341 --> 28:30.810
That's not true.

28:30.810 --> 28:32.779
This is just weather.

28:32.779 --> 28:36.515
It's just... life.

28:36.515 --> 28:39.051
We all make mistakes.

28:39.051 --> 28:42.254
You deserve
the same happiness we all do.

28:44.323 --> 28:45.825
It's gonna be fine.

28:45.825 --> 28:47.459
I know it.

28:53.833 --> 28:57.103
(thunder crashing)

29:08.314 --> 29:09.748
All set.

29:09.748 --> 29:11.450
Thank you.

29:17.990 --> 29:20.259
You know, it's not like

29:20.259 --> 29:22.728
I never thought about
having sex with you.

29:22.728 --> 29:24.396
It's just...

29:24.396 --> 29:25.865
what's the point?

29:25.865 --> 29:28.000
We have nothing in common.

29:28.000 --> 29:29.468
We're always fighting.

29:29.468 --> 29:33.072
We are very different people,

29:33.072 --> 29:35.107
and it's not like it
could ever go anywhere.

29:35.107 --> 29:37.944
Doc, I'm not saying
I want to marry you.

29:39.011 --> 29:41.180
All I'm saying is

29:41.180 --> 29:44.450
there's something here.

29:44.450 --> 29:47.753
Something between us.

29:47.753 --> 29:50.022
And there's no better cure

29:50.022 --> 29:53.225
for your little crush
on Goldenboy...

30:05.637 --> 30:07.773
Hey! You two okay?

30:07.773 --> 30:09.108
I saw Lavon's car

30:09.108 --> 30:10.742
by the side of the road,

30:10.742 --> 30:13.179
figured I needed to see where
the passengers went off to.

30:13.179 --> 30:16.048
Don't worry,
I'll drive us back to town.

30:16.048 --> 30:17.850
If we hurry,
we can still make the wedding.

30:31.597 --> 30:33.299
Looks great, doesn't it?

30:33.299 --> 30:35.701
Nicer than any party
I've ever been invited to.

30:35.701 --> 30:37.303
We got a leak
at table three.

30:37.303 --> 30:39.371
What?
Oh!

30:39.371 --> 30:42.241
Um, uh...

30:43.742 --> 30:45.945
Uh, through 14.

30:47.446 --> 30:48.847
It's okay;
you know what it is?

30:48.847 --> 30:49.848
It's like a natural waterfall.

30:49.848 --> 30:51.050
It looks great.

30:51.050 --> 30:52.284
Yeah, like an indoor
rain forest.
Yes.

30:52.284 --> 30:54.386
HAROLD:
George, bad news.

30:54.386 --> 30:56.923
I-I just heard from Harry;
the road is closed.

30:56.923 --> 30:59.325
Harry, Leslie and Lily Louise

30:59.325 --> 31:01.793
are not gonna make it
to the wedding.

31:01.793 --> 31:03.329
Your brother's not coming?

31:03.329 --> 31:05.731
Okay, so I have no best man
and no flower girl?

31:05.731 --> 31:07.099
Son, we don't have to do this.

31:07.099 --> 31:08.935
No, no, no.
Everyone would understand.

31:08.935 --> 31:11.103
No, it's gonna be fine.

31:11.103 --> 31:13.639
Dad, how would you feel
about being my best man?

31:14.740 --> 31:16.342
Well, uh, I'd be honored.

31:16.342 --> 31:17.809
Okay, great.

31:17.809 --> 31:20.679
Uh, great.

31:20.679 --> 31:22.681
It's gonna be fine.

31:22.681 --> 31:24.883
(thunder crashing)

31:26.018 --> 31:27.853
They moved the reception
to the firehouse,

31:27.853 --> 31:29.221
so no one will get zapped.

31:29.221 --> 31:32.224
Addy said it's actually
gonna be pretty nice.

31:32.224 --> 31:35.327
Which is such
a selfless statement, you know,

31:35.327 --> 31:36.929
'cause she's been
doing her hair all day,

31:36.929 --> 31:40.699
and this rain's just gonna make
it look like she got zapped.

31:40.699 --> 31:42.334
You two are awfully quiet.

31:42.334 --> 31:44.036
Must have been quite
the ordeal, huh?

31:44.036 --> 31:47.706
Yeah, it had its moments.
Mmm.

31:47.706 --> 31:49.241
What you both need to do

31:49.241 --> 31:51.310
is go home, take
off those clothes,

31:51.310 --> 31:52.844
get in the hot
shower and warm up.

31:52.844 --> 31:55.948
You know, that's exactly
what I was hoping to do.

31:57.049 --> 31:59.585
(laughing)

31:59.585 --> 32:02.021
BILL:
All right, Wade, we're here.

32:02.021 --> 32:04.756
You know, you better hurry
and get into that suit

32:04.756 --> 32:06.125
so you can make
the wedding.

32:06.125 --> 32:07.994
Uh, hey, listen, Bill,

32:07.994 --> 32:10.496
I-I don't want you
to miss the big event.

32:10.496 --> 32:13.599
I'll, uh,
I'll take the doctor home.

32:13.599 --> 32:14.500
You crazy?

32:14.500 --> 32:15.834
It's cats and
dogs out there.

32:15.834 --> 32:16.902
Zoe,

32:16.902 --> 32:19.305
a Southern gentleman

32:19.305 --> 32:22.408
drives a lady right
to her doorstep.

32:22.408 --> 32:23.775
(chuckles)

32:23.775 --> 32:25.377
See you later, Wade.

32:49.635 --> 32:52.138
Sal, Sal, your table's going
down, get some towels, okay?

32:52.138 --> 32:53.772
And-and-and, oh, my gosh.

32:53.772 --> 32:56.508
Can somebody help Shula with
the, with the ice sculptures?

32:56.508 --> 32:57.943
It's starting to warp, okay?

32:57.943 --> 32:59.211
(swan squawking)
Thank you, thank you so...

32:59.211 --> 33:01.980
Oh, who let the swans
near the centerpieces?

33:01.980 --> 33:03.849
So sorry, there's
more bad news.

33:03.849 --> 33:04.916
What, Brick?

33:04.916 --> 33:06.318
The power is
out in Daphne,

33:06.318 --> 33:09.088
and the entire wedding band
is stuck in an elevator.

33:09.088 --> 33:11.157
No big deal, no big deal,

33:11.157 --> 33:13.525
because we can play music
off of my phone.

33:13.525 --> 33:14.660
So that'll work.

33:14.660 --> 33:17.263
So, yeah. Yes, Tom?

33:17.263 --> 33:18.464
Hi, the gas is out
in the kitchen.

33:18.464 --> 33:20.532
Great, great.
The food will be

33:20.532 --> 33:22.401
just as delicious
at room temperature...

33:26.772 --> 33:28.240
Okay, nobody panic. I-I...

33:28.240 --> 33:31.210
I can fix this. I can fix this,
all I need is a ladder.

33:31.210 --> 33:32.544
Uh, uh, where's the ladder?!

33:32.544 --> 33:34.146
What kind of firehouse
doesn't have a ladder?

33:34.146 --> 33:35.947
George. What is going on?
What?!

33:35.947 --> 33:37.416
I'm getting married, Lavon,
that's what's going on!

33:37.416 --> 33:39.017
I know, but the roof is leaking,

33:39.017 --> 33:40.286
the ceiling's falling down,

33:40.286 --> 33:42.154
there's no band,
no gas, and...

33:42.154 --> 33:44.856
well, you may as well know,

33:44.856 --> 33:46.325
Spot got into
the wedding cake.

33:47.193 --> 33:48.427
None of that matters.

33:48.427 --> 33:50.396
None of it matters.
Maybe not to you but,

33:50.396 --> 33:53.299
you and I both know, all this
stuff matters to your bride.

33:53.299 --> 33:54.633
No, Lemon's going to
think it's fine.

33:54.633 --> 33:56.435
Because it's fine,
Lavon. It's fine.

33:56.435 --> 33:58.337
George, please believe me,
no one will be upset

33:58.337 --> 33:59.905
if you postpone.
The hairdos alone...

33:59.905 --> 34:01.807
We are not postponing
this wedding.

34:01.807 --> 34:04.376
But look at this place.
Lemon and I are
getting married right now.

34:04.376 --> 34:05.811
Why does it have
to be right now?
Because!

34:05.811 --> 34:08.780
Because why?
Because if
it's not today, then...

34:14.985 --> 34:16.888
Well, Lemon got
one of her wishes--

34:16.888 --> 34:20.025
people will be talking about
this wedding for years to come.

34:20.025 --> 34:21.260
(both chuckling)

34:21.260 --> 34:22.793
Harold, thank you for
all your help today.

34:22.793 --> 34:25.063
Well, I just want you to know
that my grandchildren

34:25.063 --> 34:26.465
are going to be
Auburn Tigers.

34:26.465 --> 34:28.833
Oh, maybe so, but mine will
be bleeding Alabama red.

34:28.833 --> 34:31.137
Not that I want
them bleeding...
Harold?

34:31.137 --> 34:33.472
Oh, Brick, I want you to meet
one of my cousins

34:33.472 --> 34:35.005
who's been staying at
the B and B.

34:35.005 --> 34:38.210
She's been helping us out.
Emily Chase, Brick Breeland.

34:38.210 --> 34:39.578
Hey.
Thanks so much
for having us, Brick.

34:39.578 --> 34:41.513
Well, I'm sorry if your
impression of our town

34:41.513 --> 34:43.681
hasn't been
the best yet.
Oh, that's okay.

34:43.681 --> 34:46.118
If I don't like this town,
another one's

34:46.118 --> 34:47.953
sure to float along soon,
right?

34:47.953 --> 34:49.455
(laughs)

34:49.455 --> 34:50.522
Well, I had better
go get changed.

34:50.522 --> 34:51.623
Welcome to BlueBell, Emily.

34:51.623 --> 34:54.360
And you stay as
long as you want.

34:54.360 --> 34:56.628
Thank you.
Yeah.

34:58.364 --> 35:00.766
What are you looking at?

35:22.721 --> 35:24.323
(electrical crackling)

35:45.777 --> 35:48.614
Why didn't anybody tell me
she was staying?

36:10.969 --> 36:13.171
* *

36:27.953 --> 36:31.323
* *

36:53.912 --> 36:55.881
(both moaning)

37:16.302 --> 37:18.804
(both giggling)

37:21.740 --> 37:23.809
Lemon, sweetie?

37:23.809 --> 37:24.876
It is time.

37:24.876 --> 37:26.978
We gotta get you down
to that firehouse.

37:26.978 --> 37:28.947
LEMON:
Not exactly what I dreamed of
as a little girl.

37:28.947 --> 37:31.116
I'll bet in your dreams,

37:31.116 --> 37:32.584
you were marrying a man that

37:32.584 --> 37:34.320
you loved with
your whole heart.

37:34.320 --> 37:36.154
And you are tonight.

37:36.154 --> 37:40.792
And I'll bet you were the most
beautiful bride in the world.

37:44.162 --> 37:45.497
Oh, my God.

37:47.232 --> 37:48.700
And you most certainly are.

37:48.700 --> 37:51.069
(chuckles)

37:51.069 --> 37:53.405
Your mother would be
so proud.

37:55.240 --> 37:57.743
And screw her
for missing this.

37:57.743 --> 37:59.911
That's right,
Daddy. Screw her.

37:59.911 --> 38:01.179
We don't need her.

38:01.179 --> 38:03.214
We never did.

38:03.214 --> 38:04.950
Aw, I love you.

38:04.950 --> 38:07.653
Okay?

38:07.653 --> 38:09.087
George.

38:09.087 --> 38:10.356
Lemon, I need
to talk to you.

38:10.356 --> 38:12.391
Well, you know
it is considered

38:12.391 --> 38:14.760
bad luck to see the bride
before the wedding.

38:14.760 --> 38:17.028
It's okay, Daddy.
(chuckles)

38:17.028 --> 38:18.664
It's okay.

38:27.973 --> 38:29.475
Lemon, I-I tried.

38:29.475 --> 38:31.377
I-I tried my hardest.

38:31.377 --> 38:33.111
I have been fighting
all day to...

38:33.111 --> 38:34.946
try and make
this wedding work.

38:34.946 --> 38:37.649
I appreciate that, George.
(chuckles)

38:37.649 --> 38:39.017
I fought, because I...

38:39.017 --> 38:42.253
I know that if I stand
in front of this town,

38:42.253 --> 38:43.655
and in front of God,

38:43.655 --> 38:45.524
and I pledge to be
faithful to you,

38:45.524 --> 38:47.759
I will be, forever.

38:47.759 --> 38:49.561
So, let's do it.
Let's get married.

38:49.561 --> 38:53.599
Lemon, you deserve more
than my fidelity.

38:55.300 --> 38:57.603
You deserve my whole heart.

38:58.404 --> 39:00.806
What are you saying, George?

39:00.806 --> 39:04.342
Lemon, I have loved you for
what feels like my entire life.

39:05.677 --> 39:07.446
But when I went to New York,
I opened a door,

39:07.446 --> 39:10.315
and you turned to Lavon.

39:10.315 --> 39:13.585
And when I found out,
I turned to Zoe.

39:13.585 --> 39:14.820
And there's nothing
that can erase

39:14.820 --> 39:16.254
the things that
we have done.

39:16.254 --> 39:19.357
And there is nothing
that can erase...

39:21.393 --> 39:23.128
...what I now feel.

39:25.397 --> 39:27.566
Lemon, I cannot marry you.

39:29.100 --> 39:31.369
Not when a part of me
is in love with someone else.

39:33.472 --> 39:37.142
(chuckles)

39:41.046 --> 39:42.814
(grunts)

39:48.720 --> 39:53.925
(Zoe and Wade chuckling)

39:53.925 --> 39:55.727
So, what now?

39:55.727 --> 39:58.530
Well, get some
food for sustenance,

39:58.530 --> 40:01.933
then do it all over again.

40:01.933 --> 40:03.535
Or vise versa.

40:03.535 --> 40:06.605
(both moaning)

40:06.605 --> 40:08.006
(knocking on door)

40:08.006 --> 40:09.908
No, ignore it.
Ignore it. Come here.

40:09.908 --> 40:12.010
Ignore it.
No, no, I can't.

40:12.010 --> 40:13.445
It's Lavon
checking up on me.

40:13.445 --> 40:14.580
(sighs)
I know.

40:14.580 --> 40:17.182
But I'll be right back.

40:23.489 --> 40:25.090
George.

40:27.626 --> 40:29.928
Are you okay?

40:29.928 --> 40:31.930
Aren't you suppose to be
at your wedding?

40:31.930 --> 40:34.132
There isn't going
to be a wedding.

40:35.467 --> 40:37.503
It's over. It's, uh...

40:37.503 --> 40:38.770
It's all over.

40:38.770 --> 40:41.740
Look, Zoe, I thought that

40:41.740 --> 40:44.242
if you went to New York,
I might be able

40:44.242 --> 40:45.611
to put you out of my mind.

40:45.611 --> 40:47.012
And maybe I could have.

40:47.012 --> 40:49.147
But now I know
that I can't.

40:51.116 --> 40:53.451
And I don't want to.

41:05.697 --> 41:07.499
It's been a long day.

41:07.499 --> 41:09.501
But I'll call
you tomorrow.

41:10.536 --> 41:13.772
'Cause we got a lot
to talk about.

41:33.759 --> 41:35.761
Hey.
