WEBVTT

00:01.568 --> 00:04.103
(Christmas-like music)

00:16.883 --> 00:18.884
Julia.
Mm-hm?

00:18.886 --> 00:20.886
The driver.

00:20.888 --> 00:22.888
I'm sure he's seen this before.

00:22.890 --> 00:24.790
And much more, I'd wager.

00:24.792 --> 00:26.625
You're probably right.

00:29.763 --> 00:31.830
It's almost Christmas.
Hm!

00:33.566 --> 00:35.367
♪ Pray, wither sailed those ships all three ♪

00:35.369 --> 00:39.004
♪ On Christmas day, on Christmas day ♪

00:39.006 --> 00:41.573
♪ Pray, wither sailed those ships all three ♪

00:41.575 --> 00:44.476
♪ On Christmas day in the morning ♪

00:44.478 --> 00:48.280
♪ O they sailed into Bethlehem

00:48.282 --> 00:50.816
♪ On Christmas day, on Christmas day ♪

00:50.818 --> 00:53.285
♪ O they sailed into Bethlehem

00:53.287 --> 00:57.089
♪ On Christmas day in the morning ♪

00:57.091 --> 00:59.725

00:59.727 --> 01:02.361
♪ On Christmas day, on Christmas day ♪

01:21.782 --> 01:24.950
(applause)

01:24.952 --> 01:27.052
Ladies and Gentlemen.

01:27.054 --> 01:29.555
The festivities are
about to get underway.

01:46.106 --> 01:48.173
Oh, it's so beautiful.

01:51.311 --> 01:53.679
Enjoying yourself?

01:53.681 --> 01:55.781
I will be when this
bloody pantomime is over.

01:55.783 --> 01:58.283
(whispered): Oh, Thomas.

01:58.285 --> 02:00.552
Goose, with apples and prunes.

02:00.554 --> 02:03.355
I could have some,
if you don't mind.

02:03.357 --> 02:06.859
(lighting of a match)

02:06.861 --> 02:10.028
Grandmother?
Rest, my dear.

02:10.030 --> 02:13.499
You will be home soon.

02:19.038 --> 02:23.175
Hm!
(expressions of surprise)

02:30.683 --> 02:33.118
(applause)

02:35.889 --> 02:39.024
(audible yawn)

02:39.026 --> 02:42.694
Something the matter, George?
I've got something in my eye.

02:42.696 --> 02:45.697
Are you crying?
No. I'm not crying.

02:45.699 --> 02:48.200
Did you enjoy the
performance, gentlemen?

02:48.202 --> 02:51.236
George was crying.
It's a very touching piece,

02:51.238 --> 02:53.939
George. No shame
in feeling its emotions.

02:53.941 --> 02:57.009
It's not my fault that I'm
cursed with a sensitive soul.

02:57.011 --> 03:00.245
No doubt speaks to
your gifts as a writer.

03:00.247 --> 03:02.548
I think you're right, Doctor.
I think that's very astute.

03:02.550 --> 03:04.616
But I was not crying.

03:04.618 --> 03:06.618
I'm just gonna
slip out for a wee nip.

03:06.620 --> 03:08.887
You will not, Thomas.
Ladies and Gentlemen,

03:08.889 --> 03:11.857
if I could have
your kind attention.

03:11.859 --> 03:14.426
It gives me great pleasure

03:14.428 --> 03:17.696
to introduce your hostess
for this evening,

03:17.698 --> 03:20.065
Mrs. Millicent McGowan.

03:20.067 --> 03:22.868
(applause and awes)

03:22.870 --> 03:24.903
Thank you all for coming.

03:24.905 --> 03:27.906
And now, I'd like
to introduce to you

03:27.908 --> 03:30.642
the star of this
evening's performance.

03:30.644 --> 03:33.111
Come on stage, Mary.

03:33.113 --> 03:36.281
I give you Miss Mary Pickford.
(applause and acclamations)

03:36.283 --> 03:39.585
Treasure her now
because, soon, she's off

03:39.587 --> 03:41.954
to America to try her hand
at the moving pictures.

03:41.956 --> 03:44.990
(Impressed reactions)
Thank you for coming,
Ladies and Gentlemen.

03:44.992 --> 03:47.459
And remember to give from
your hearts, this Christmas...

03:47.461 --> 03:49.461
Thank you, Mary.
Oh! (snicker)

03:49.463 --> 03:52.931
The fate of the Little
Match Girl is sobering,

03:52.933 --> 03:56.301
but sadly not unique.
And the fate and fortunes

03:56.303 --> 03:59.638
of Toronto's poor children
is the reason for my husband's

03:59.640 --> 04:03.875
Christmas Gala. His fifth,
I might add, and it is my hope

04:03.877 --> 04:06.411
that his kindness will spur you

04:06.413 --> 04:08.981
to make this Christmas,
the best Christmas

04:08.983 --> 04:12.918
for Toronto's sick
children and orphans.

04:12.920 --> 04:17.022
(applause)

04:17.024 --> 04:19.558
Children, form a queue.

04:19.560 --> 04:23.829
We have a very special guest
in attendance tonight.

04:23.831 --> 04:25.931
Gentlemen.

04:25.933 --> 04:27.933
Bloody showboat.

04:27.935 --> 04:30.769
Thomas, stop being
such a pill. Mr. McGowan

04:30.771 --> 04:33.005
is one of Toronto's
greatest philanthropists,

04:33.007 --> 04:35.540
indulge him
in his moment.

04:41.014 --> 04:44.249
Close the door. Close the
door! Close the door.

04:44.251 --> 04:47.452
I think something is wrong.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
boys and girls...

04:47.454 --> 04:49.721
He's probably pickled.
(snicker)

04:49.723 --> 04:53.125
I'm sorry, but there's
going to be a slight delay.

04:55.061 --> 04:57.195
George.

04:58.631 --> 05:00.632
Mrs. McGowan...

05:00.634 --> 05:02.334
the rest of the
presents, they're gone.

05:02.336 --> 05:04.836
Gone? What are you
talking about, gone?

05:04.838 --> 05:08.173
They've been stolen.
His neck is broken.

05:08.175 --> 05:10.609
Oh my God.

05:10.611 --> 05:12.544
Well, I suppose that's put
the kibosh on Christmas.

05:12.546 --> 05:14.546
We best get an attendant
to cover him up

05:14.548 --> 05:17.082
before the children see.
Right.

05:17.084 --> 05:20.819
George?
I'll clear everyone off, sir.

05:23.756 --> 05:28.093
Now, tonight's not when
we put out the presents.

05:28.095 --> 05:31.697
Christmas Eve is
the night for that.

05:31.699 --> 05:35.067
You understand that? Is there
something you're hoping for?

05:35.069 --> 05:38.904
I'd love a new doll. I've
heard there's one that talks.

05:38.906 --> 05:41.640
Well, have you been good?

05:41.642 --> 05:44.976
I try.
You try!

05:44.978 --> 05:47.913
She tries. What more can we ask?

05:47.915 --> 05:50.549
As long as you try not be bad,

05:50.551 --> 05:52.651
or cruel,

05:52.653 --> 05:54.419
that's enough!

05:54.421 --> 05:56.855
Excuse me, sir.
Yes?

05:56.857 --> 05:59.191
I'm afraid we need you
to move along? We're conducting

05:59.193 --> 06:00.926
an investigation now, and we
should get the children home.

06:00.928 --> 06:03.328
Of course, of course!

06:03.330 --> 06:05.263
Alright, beautiful children,

06:05.265 --> 06:09.534
I wish you good night.
Try to sleep well.

06:09.536 --> 06:12.404
Alright.
Thank you, sir.

06:15.208 --> 06:18.777
And you know, sir, I could
give you... if you wanted it,

06:18.779 --> 06:22.381
I could give you the name
of a... a good barber.

06:22.383 --> 06:25.584
(chuckling)

06:25.586 --> 06:29.421
That's really not
necessary, son. Thank you.

06:32.825 --> 06:35.060
Saint Nick's last ride.

06:35.062 --> 06:37.829
We've got all the names
and addresses of the guests.

06:37.831 --> 06:40.499
Ah, thank you, sir.
Could you drop Julia home?

06:40.501 --> 06:43.902
Course.
I have to stay a while longer.

06:43.904 --> 06:47.105
(coughing)

06:47.107 --> 06:49.107
Could you excuse me  just one moment?

06:49.109 --> 06:51.743
I'll get my outer coat.

06:51.745 --> 06:55.313
Are you alright?

06:55.315 --> 06:58.316
Yes.

06:58.318 --> 07:00.318
How long have you  been like this?

07:00.320 --> 07:03.054
I don't know.

07:03.056 --> 07:06.525
Excuse me. Can you
take this boy with you

07:06.527 --> 07:09.795
to The Hospital For Sick Children?
I'll let the nuns know.

07:09.797 --> 07:12.164
Of course.

07:19.605 --> 07:21.606
Mrs. McGowan,

07:21.608 --> 07:24.109
I'm terribly sorry for your loss.

07:24.111 --> 07:27.345
(holding back tears):
He was a wonderful man.

07:27.347 --> 07:29.981
Well, in my experience,

07:29.983 --> 07:32.117
even wonderful
men have enemies.

07:32.119 --> 07:35.187
And all the presents...

07:35.189 --> 07:37.522
Missing.

07:37.524 --> 07:41.226
They were for the children.
(crying): Poor children.

07:41.228 --> 07:45.297
Mrs. McGowan, someone
wanted your husband dead.

07:45.299 --> 07:49.468
And succeeded.
Yes. Who?

07:49.470 --> 07:51.703
The only one that I can think of

07:51.705 --> 07:54.506
that has a heart dark enough
to do this is Cyrus Lynch.

07:54.508 --> 07:57.442
Cyrus Lynch.
Of Lynch Fabrications?

07:57.444 --> 08:01.046
The one and only.
And why do you say that?

08:01.048 --> 08:03.348
He and my husband were friends once.

08:03.350 --> 08:05.684
And friends can become vicious enemies.

08:05.686 --> 08:09.721
But...
But?

08:09.723 --> 08:13.258
...but to kill a man
days before Christmas

08:13.260 --> 08:16.394
and steal alms from the poor...

08:16.396 --> 08:20.131
I didn't think
Mr. Lynch would go that far.

08:22.668 --> 08:25.403
Again, terribly sorry.

08:25.405 --> 08:27.973
We may need
to speak again.

08:33.846 --> 08:36.481
The donations were stored
in the building over there.

08:36.483 --> 08:40.051
We only discovered they were
gone after Mr. McGowan's death.

08:40.053 --> 08:42.420
And you didn't notice
anything unusual today?

08:42.422 --> 08:45.290
I heard something in the woods
before the guests arrived.

08:45.292 --> 08:47.025
Something?
It sounded like an animal

08:47.027 --> 08:50.161
but we didn't see anything.
Hm...

08:50.163 --> 08:52.898
Now, a sleigh
carrying a heavy burden

08:52.900 --> 08:55.934
seems to have gone this way.
What's in this direction?

08:55.936 --> 08:58.503
A few other properties.

08:58.505 --> 09:01.172
Thank you.
<i>Here you go!</i>

09:01.174 --> 09:03.441
(hubbub)

09:06.078 --> 09:08.947
Paper! Get your paper!

09:08.949 --> 09:12.284
Who killed Saint Nicholas?!

09:12.286 --> 09:15.887
Constabulary baffled!
Read all about it!

09:15.889 --> 09:18.857
The bloke could have let us
know he was taking a photograph.

09:18.859 --> 09:21.726
That's what
you look like, sir.

09:21.728 --> 09:24.930
So what did you find at McGowan's?

09:24.932 --> 09:28.266
Nothing concrete. The
groundsman seems to have heard

09:28.268 --> 09:32.237
a disturbance of some kind. And
the name Cyrus Lynch came up.

09:32.239 --> 09:35.240
He's a piece of work, this Lynch.
Apparently he and the victim

09:35.242 --> 09:38.343
were not the closest of friends.
Anything else?

09:38.345 --> 09:40.645
I checked the city
survey. Mr. Lynch's home

09:40.647 --> 09:43.682
is quite near to Mr. McGowan's.
(knocking nearby)

09:43.684 --> 09:46.151
Would it kill ya

09:46.153 --> 09:48.620
to hold the ladder, Henry?
Hey Jackson!

09:48.622 --> 09:50.555
What do you think you're doing?

09:50.557 --> 09:53.558
I'm measuring the height of
the ceiling, sir. For the tree.

09:53.560 --> 09:55.694
The-There will not
be a tree in here.

09:55.696 --> 09:58.263
No tree?
Bloody Germans

09:58.265 --> 10:00.031
and their idiotic
traditions. Jackson, get down!

10:00.033 --> 10:03.668
Sir, a tree wouldn't
be a terrible idea.

10:03.670 --> 10:06.271
This is a place of work,
Murdoch, not a bloody herbarium.

10:06.273 --> 10:08.340
Well everybody,
just popped by

10:08.342 --> 10:10.342
to wish everyone
the best of the season.

10:10.344 --> 10:13.278
I'm off to Newfoundland.
Oh right, George. Have
a pleasant journey.

10:13.280 --> 10:15.947
Oh sir, I hope to. And
if my connections are reliable,

10:15.949 --> 10:17.983
I'll make it the St. Johns just
in time for the festivities.

10:17.985 --> 10:22.420
My aunts are expecting me.
George, this arrived for you.

10:27.693 --> 10:29.861
My aunts are going on some journey

10:29.863 --> 10:31.863
with a mysterious benefactor?

10:31.865 --> 10:35.266
Hardly seems worth the trip now.
Oh, don't worry

10:35.268 --> 10:37.969
about it, bugalugs. I've
got plenty for you to do.

10:37.971 --> 10:39.871
Instead of gallivanting across
the country, you can help

10:39.873 --> 10:41.973
Murdoch, here, find out
who murdered St. Nicholas.

10:41.975 --> 10:44.876
Right. I could
use the company.

10:48.948 --> 10:51.216
I can't believe
they would just abandon me.

10:51.218 --> 10:53.885
What am I gonna do now?

10:56.088 --> 10:58.223
Higgins, perhaps you and I could...

10:58.225 --> 11:00.392
...spend Christmas together?

11:00.394 --> 11:03.561
(laughing mildly): No, I don't
think so, George. I have plans.

11:03.563 --> 11:06.097
Yes, no. Of course.

11:27.586 --> 11:29.587
Sir, why Mr. Lynch?

11:29.589 --> 11:32.424
Mrs. McGowan
suspects Cyrus Lynch.

11:32.426 --> 11:34.592
Also, when I was at
the McGowan's last night,

11:34.594 --> 11:37.462
I saw tracks heading
towards Cyrus Lynch's home.

11:37.464 --> 11:39.864
Good eye, sir.
Do you mind if I drive?

11:39.866 --> 11:42.634
Go ahead, George.

11:46.572 --> 11:48.573
I get the lead
on the way home.

11:48.575 --> 11:50.942
Fair enough, sir.
(clicking sounds)

11:50.944 --> 11:53.011
(sleigh bells ringing)

11:56.348 --> 11:59.617
Tell the policeman what you saw.

11:59.619 --> 12:02.020
Go on, son.

12:02.022 --> 12:04.422
I was out for a walk
on the Parker Trail last night

12:04.424 --> 12:07.058
and I saw something
in the woods.

12:07.060 --> 12:09.594
The Parker Trail?
You know the one.

12:09.596 --> 12:12.030
Near where all
the rich people live.

12:12.032 --> 12:14.365
You brought him in here for this?

12:14.367 --> 12:17.569
Tell him what you told me.

12:17.571 --> 12:19.571
The thing I saw.

12:19.573 --> 12:22.407
It was a creature.
A creature?

12:22.409 --> 12:25.510
Yes, sir. It looked
like a man. But it wasn't.

12:25.512 --> 12:28.379
It had horns
and... big ears.

12:28.381 --> 12:31.082
A big-eared, horny creature?

12:31.084 --> 12:34.319
Yes sir.
I tell you what, son:

12:34.321 --> 12:37.422
I'll get a couple of my men
to go take a look.

12:37.424 --> 12:39.424
We wouldn't want this creature
spoiling your Christmas,

12:39.426 --> 12:42.427
now would we?
Thank you, sir.

12:42.429 --> 12:44.796
And, uh, one more thing...

12:44.798 --> 12:47.932
What's that?
I found this.

12:47.934 --> 12:51.336
It's from the beast.

12:59.478 --> 13:01.546
Krampus.

13:06.018 --> 13:08.453
(birds chirping)

13:08.455 --> 13:10.688
<i>We haven't seen him</i>

13:10.690 --> 13:13.158
since yesterday.
Is that unusual?

13:13.160 --> 13:16.261
Very much so. Mr. Lynch
is something of a homebody.

13:16.263 --> 13:18.596
That is when he is not at work.

13:18.598 --> 13:20.598
I inquired.
He wasn't there, either.

13:20.600 --> 13:23.001
I very much need
to speak with him.

13:23.003 --> 13:25.637
So do I. I'm hoping to be
relieved for the holiday,

13:25.639 --> 13:28.540
but he's disappeared.
Is this a recent photo?

13:28.542 --> 13:30.842
It is.
May I?

13:30.844 --> 13:35.180
Thank you.
Sir.

13:35.182 --> 13:38.516
Sir.
What have you, George?

13:38.518 --> 13:42.487
Look at this. "Compliments
of Alistair McGowan."

13:42.489 --> 13:45.356
One of the stolen gifts.
Were there others?

13:45.358 --> 13:47.358
This is the only one
I could find, sir.

13:47.360 --> 13:50.528
It would appear Mr. Lynch
is trying to steal Christmas.

13:50.530 --> 13:53.498
I want these distributed to
all points of exit from Toronto.

13:53.500 --> 13:56.401
Train stations, livery
yards, lake steamers.

13:56.403 --> 13:58.703
We must find Cyrus Lynch.

13:58.705 --> 14:01.773
Sir, all those places will be
overrun by holiday travelers.

14:01.775 --> 14:03.875
Then all the more likely
someone is to have

14:03.877 --> 14:06.578
seen him, Henry. Get to it!

14:06.580 --> 14:09.414
Yes, sir.
(hubbub)

14:09.416 --> 14:12.317
Constable Jackson?

14:12.319 --> 14:15.653
It's a pity we can't
have a tree, sir.

14:15.655 --> 14:19.390
It would certainly make
our task feel more festive.

14:19.392 --> 14:21.526
Hm. They do

14:21.528 --> 14:23.862
lighten the spirit, don't they?
Yes, sir!

14:23.864 --> 14:27.532
You should see my family's tree.
Ten feet tall if it was an inch.

14:27.534 --> 14:29.734
And when all the candles are ablaze it is...

14:29.736 --> 14:31.703
That's a fire hazard, isn't it?

14:31.705 --> 14:34.072
Well, it may be,
sir, but...

14:34.074 --> 14:36.040
what a fire hazard!
(chuckles)

14:36.042 --> 14:39.444
Please, will you talk
to the Inspector?

14:39.446 --> 14:41.379
Ready your axe, Jackson.

14:41.381 --> 14:43.815
Ha ha! Thank
you, sir. Ha!

14:43.817 --> 14:46.484
We're getting
a tree! Ha ha!

14:58.764 --> 15:01.833
(hustle and bustle)

15:13.112 --> 15:15.780
My mother will be
marinating the goose by now.

15:15.782 --> 15:17.782
Already?
A goose needs to be

15:17.784 --> 15:21.052
well sauced, Henry. Sometimes
we eat it the night before.

15:21.054 --> 15:23.321
On Christmas Eve?
I know. But sometimes

15:23.323 --> 15:26.291
we just can't resist. Merry
Christmas, my good man!

15:26.293 --> 15:28.826
How about you, Henry?

15:28.828 --> 15:30.995
I'm going to the home
of James and Helen McVie.

15:30.997 --> 15:33.164
They're old family friends.
Sounds boring.

15:33.166 --> 15:35.166
You wouldn't say that if you
laid eyes on their daughter,

15:35.168 --> 15:38.436
Elsie, George. Henry Higgins,
your own walking, talking

15:38.438 --> 15:40.838
Christmas gift. Signed,
sealed, and delivered.

15:40.840 --> 15:43.474
Best of the season,
my good man. Well,

15:43.476 --> 15:46.144
I can't wait to get home. They
won't trim the tree without me.

15:46.146 --> 15:48.746
And how about you, George?

15:48.748 --> 15:50.748
I was going to go
home to Newfoundland.

15:50.750 --> 15:52.784
Until his aunts got a better offer.

15:52.786 --> 15:55.687
I'm sure they have a good reason.

15:55.689 --> 15:58.323
You know, I suppose I'll
just stay in the city now.

15:58.325 --> 16:00.491
Go for a walk or something.

16:00.493 --> 16:03.461
Although... I do
love a good goose.

16:03.463 --> 16:05.797
Right, Eh...
I'm sorry, George,

16:05.799 --> 16:08.566
but Mother insists that
Christmas be for family only.

16:08.568 --> 16:11.002
Oh, of course, of course,
who better to spend it with?

16:11.004 --> 16:13.571
Why don't you celebrate
with the Detective?

16:13.573 --> 16:15.573
I'm not gonna be a third
wheel at the Detective

16:15.575 --> 16:19.444
and Doctor Ogden's festivities.
So the Inspector, then?

16:19.446 --> 16:22.013
Higgins, the Inspector?
Are you daft? Anyway,

16:22.015 --> 16:24.549
what does it matter? In
the end it's just another day.

16:24.551 --> 16:27.318
That's right George,
that's all it is.

16:27.320 --> 16:29.821
Nothing special at all.

16:29.823 --> 16:32.523
Ahem! Merry Christmas everybody!

16:32.525 --> 16:36.160
(man): Merry Christmas!
(woman): A happy Christmas!

16:36.162 --> 16:38.463
Yes,

16:38.465 --> 16:40.565
that is one of Mr. McGowan's.

16:40.567 --> 16:44.002
Where did you find it?
In Cyrus Lynch's home.

16:44.004 --> 16:46.037
And Mr. Lynch?

16:46.039 --> 16:50.041
Still unaccounted for.
I don't envy your job.

16:50.043 --> 16:52.610
And to have to deal with
a murder before Christmas.

16:52.612 --> 16:55.947
Murder is a vile crime,
no matter the season.

16:55.949 --> 16:57.949
Can you tell
me any more

16:57.951 --> 17:00.685
about Mr. Lynch and
Mr. McGowan's relationship?

17:00.687 --> 17:04.355
They were not fond of one another.

17:04.357 --> 17:06.891
By all accounts,
that's an understatement.

17:06.893 --> 17:09.727
As young men, the two
were partners but...

17:09.729 --> 17:12.897
something happened and
their friendship strained.

17:12.899 --> 17:15.900
Something?
Millicent.

17:15.902 --> 17:19.837
They both had designs on her,
but she chose Mr. McGowan.

17:19.839 --> 17:22.306
They were married years
ago, were they not?

17:22.308 --> 17:24.876
Almost twenty.
Then why would Mr. Lynch wait

17:24.878 --> 17:27.211
all this time
to exact his revenge?

17:27.213 --> 17:29.881
Perhaps he got tired

17:29.883 --> 17:32.316
of hearing Mr. McGowan
be called a saint

17:32.318 --> 17:34.318
when he clearly
knew him as a sinner.

17:34.320 --> 17:37.121
Perhaps he resented the fact

17:37.123 --> 17:40.224
that a thief was being treated like a king.

17:40.226 --> 17:42.593
How was that?
Mr. McGowan

17:42.595 --> 17:44.896
was not all that
he seemed, Detective Murdoch.

17:44.898 --> 17:47.899
Publicly, he was
a benevolent philanthropist...

17:47.901 --> 17:51.602
And privately?
A miser.

17:51.604 --> 17:55.606
Then how do you explain all
of these presents at Christmas?

17:55.608 --> 17:59.544
It cost him nothing. He
hardly paid his employees,

17:59.546 --> 18:02.113
he often employed their
children for more hours

18:02.115 --> 18:04.682
than the laws allow.
Any complaint was met

18:04.684 --> 18:07.452
with a threat of dismissal.

18:07.454 --> 18:10.988
Are we speaking about
the same Alistair McGowan?

18:10.990 --> 18:13.658
In the eyes of the world,
he was the embodiment

18:13.660 --> 18:17.361
of the spirit of giving. But the
world doesn't see everything.

18:17.363 --> 18:20.164
Not like an accountant.

18:20.166 --> 18:23.267
Accountants see everything.

18:23.269 --> 18:26.003
(sigh)

18:26.005 --> 18:28.272
Thank you,
Mr. Rankin.

18:28.274 --> 18:30.708
I do hope the rest of the holiday

18:30.710 --> 18:32.810
does allow for more pleasant diversion.

18:32.812 --> 18:35.246
As do I.

18:35.248 --> 18:37.915
And how do you celebrate it, sir?

18:37.917 --> 18:40.852
Quietly, with my wife.
As do I...

18:40.854 --> 18:43.521
but without the wife, sadly.

18:43.523 --> 18:46.324
I have a home  in the wilderness.

18:46.326 --> 18:50.261
Some enjoy the gaiety;
I, the tranquility.

18:50.263 --> 18:53.998
But I do miss the comfort of family.

18:54.000 --> 18:56.400
(door closing)

18:56.402 --> 18:58.469
Hello Father!

18:58.471 --> 19:01.272
Bobby. Gone
a little bit overboard

19:01.274 --> 19:03.474
on the Christmas
decorations, haven't you?

19:03.476 --> 19:05.343
Oh Thomas, it only
happens once a year.

19:05.345 --> 19:08.212
Where's John?
Out caroling with his friends.

19:08.214 --> 19:10.515
Bloody hell.
I just made this;

19:10.517 --> 19:12.917
it's called egg nog. Try it.

19:15.888 --> 19:18.823
Hm! What do you think?

19:18.825 --> 19:20.958
Waste of good rum.

19:20.960 --> 19:23.194
Ah...
Father, I was wondering...

19:23.196 --> 19:25.363
What?
Did you see that train set

19:25.365 --> 19:27.999
I was asking about?
What does a boy your age

19:28.001 --> 19:30.635
want with a train set? You don't
need a toy. You need a job.

19:30.637 --> 19:33.337
When I was your age
I was up a chimney.
I was only hoping...

19:33.339 --> 19:35.973
Your mother's side of the
family have spoiled you rotten.

19:35.975 --> 19:39.043
Why not be thankful for what you have
instead of whining for more?

19:39.045 --> 19:41.379
Ebenezer.

19:41.381 --> 19:43.414
I heard that, Margaret.
Good!

19:43.416 --> 19:46.250
(voices of well-wishers)

19:49.988 --> 19:53.090
All of the presents had been
stored in Mr. McGowan's barn.

19:53.092 --> 19:57.395
Mr. Lynch had ample time
and opportunity to remove them.

19:57.397 --> 19:59.397
So you think
he did it?

19:59.399 --> 20:01.732
(sighing): We found one of
the presents from Mr. McGowan's

20:01.734 --> 20:06.070
in Mr. Lynch's home. And
still no sign of Mr. Lynch.

20:06.072 --> 20:09.207
So he killed Mr. McGowan
and now, he's in hiding?

20:09.209 --> 20:11.475
So it would seem.
(knocking at the door)

20:11.477 --> 20:15.813
I'll get it.

20:15.815 --> 20:19.917
Oh! It's arrived!
Excellent. Come in,

20:19.919 --> 20:23.688
come in, come in.
William?

20:23.690 --> 20:26.057
There's hardly room.
Don't be silly.

20:26.059 --> 20:28.159
There's always room
for a Christmas tree!

20:28.161 --> 20:31.462
( snicker and first notes of <i> O Christmas Tree </i>  )

20:31.464 --> 20:35.032
(humming to the song)

20:35.034 --> 20:38.703
I'm not usually
a sentimental sort

20:38.705 --> 20:41.405
but I have kept
these things since childhood.

20:41.407 --> 20:43.975
Oh!
I thought that was broken?

20:43.977 --> 20:46.277
I fixed it.

20:46.279 --> 20:49.180
Are you humming?

20:49.182 --> 20:51.782
Me? No.

20:51.784 --> 20:54.085
(little snicker)

20:54.087 --> 20:56.053
Full of surprises.

20:57.990 --> 21:01.058
(hubbub)

21:32.190 --> 21:35.159
Merry Christmas!

21:35.161 --> 21:37.862
Can I help you, sir?

21:37.864 --> 21:40.197
Yes. Do you have, um...

21:40.199 --> 21:43.501
anything like a small
duck or a capon?

21:43.503 --> 21:45.503
Smallest I got

21:45.505 --> 21:48.205
is four pounds
and it's spoken for.

21:48.207 --> 21:50.107
What about a turkey?

21:50.109 --> 21:52.109
Ten's the least.

21:52.111 --> 21:55.179
Nothing for a single person?
On Christmas? Hardly.

21:55.181 --> 21:57.648
There's never anything for
a single person on Christmas.

21:57.650 --> 22:00.718
Right. Thank you.
Hey. Wait, wait, wait.

22:00.720 --> 22:03.321
Uh...

22:05.223 --> 22:07.224
I got these.

22:07.226 --> 22:09.827
Huh?

22:09.829 --> 22:13.130
I'll take them.
Great.

22:13.132 --> 22:15.933
That'll be... 75 cents.

22:15.935 --> 22:17.935
75 cents?!

22:17.937 --> 22:20.237
Holiday prices!

22:20.239 --> 22:22.273
(sigh)

22:24.209 --> 22:26.677
Merry Christmas!

22:26.679 --> 22:29.680
(birds chirping)

22:29.682 --> 22:31.816
♪

22:38.256 --> 22:40.825
(branch cracking)

22:42.828 --> 22:45.196
Never ever sneak up on a man.

22:45.198 --> 22:47.164
Why are you here?

22:47.166 --> 22:50.301
Just looking around.
So you believe me?

22:50.303 --> 22:52.403
I'm simply taking a walk.

22:52.405 --> 22:55.106
Besides, it was just your imagination.

22:55.108 --> 22:57.575
If you thought that, you would
not be snooping around here.

23:00.178 --> 23:02.713
What kind of animal track do you think that is?

23:02.715 --> 23:05.950
I don't know.
But I think you do.

23:22.067 --> 23:25.269
All right, you lot,
get off your backsides!

23:25.271 --> 23:27.405
WE... are going
to find this man.

23:27.407 --> 23:29.874
Of course we are, sir.
Oh, I'm glad you're showing

23:29.876 --> 23:32.743
some confidence, Jackson,
because until he's behind bars,

23:32.745 --> 23:35.112
all leave is canceled!
Cancelled?!

23:35.114 --> 23:37.448
Sir, what about Elsie?
Please, sir,

23:37.450 --> 23:39.784
it's Christmas.
You want Christmas,

23:39.786 --> 23:43.020
find St. Nick's killer.

23:43.022 --> 23:45.289
I want my Christmas.

23:45.291 --> 23:48.225
I promised my mother...
Hang Christmas!

23:48.227 --> 23:51.095
I wanted Elsie.
You know what?

23:51.097 --> 23:53.264
This might not be so bad.

23:53.266 --> 23:55.966
What are you talking about?
Well, we'll spend Christmas

23:55.968 --> 23:58.569
together. The three lads!
We'll make a go of it.

24:01.306 --> 24:04.108
(barely audible): Sure.

24:04.110 --> 24:06.644
Right?

24:06.646 --> 24:09.513
I have another
job for you, George.

24:09.515 --> 24:13.017
Please take Henry and Jackson
down to Sullivan Street.

24:13.019 --> 24:15.186
Mr. Lynch has
a warehouse there.

24:15.188 --> 24:18.989
Perhaps he's stashed something.
Yes, of course.

24:20.926 --> 24:22.993
(big, obvious sigh)

24:24.930 --> 24:27.364
George?

24:27.366 --> 24:29.800
Sir, do you and Doctor Ogden...

24:29.802 --> 24:31.869
What are you doing for
Christmas? You have any plans?

24:31.871 --> 24:34.405
None at all.
Really? Well, I was asking...

24:34.407 --> 24:36.941
And we couldn't be
happier. We spend

24:36.943 --> 24:39.743
so little time alone together
that a day with nothing more

24:39.745 --> 24:42.480
than each other's
company is all we want.

24:42.482 --> 24:44.815
Yes, of course.

24:44.817 --> 24:47.351
Of course. Right, then. Off we go.

24:47.353 --> 24:50.054
George?
Sir?

24:50.056 --> 24:52.356
Could you..?

24:52.358 --> 24:54.658
Oh.

24:54.660 --> 24:56.727
My sausages.

24:58.663 --> 25:01.198
Merry Christmas!
Best of the Season.

25:01.200 --> 25:04.034
Happy Christmas, ma'am!
Jackson.

25:04.036 --> 25:06.637
Merry Christmas!
He's getting half annoying.

25:06.639 --> 25:08.772
Just half?
Happy Christmas!

25:08.774 --> 25:11.408
Merry Christmas, sir!

25:11.410 --> 25:14.078
Cut it out, Jackson.
You're an officer of the law,

25:14.080 --> 25:17.014
man, not an elf.
More like an oaf.

25:17.016 --> 25:19.083
(snickering):
Very good, Henry.

25:19.085 --> 25:22.386
You there! Merry Christmas.
Ha ha! Got ya.

25:22.388 --> 25:24.989
God, grant us patience.
Merry Christmas.

25:24.991 --> 25:27.892
Jackson!
(horse snorting)

25:27.894 --> 25:30.194
I could feign an illness.
And you think the Inspector

25:30.196 --> 25:32.930
is gonna believe that?
You should see her, George...

25:32.932 --> 25:36.267
Fellows, look:
The McGowan presents.

25:36.269 --> 25:38.536
Well, how do we know
they're from HIS house?

25:38.538 --> 25:41.105
Ha!

25:41.107 --> 25:43.807
Look at this.

25:43.809 --> 25:46.143
It's a sled.
Not just any sled.

25:46.145 --> 25:48.145
And it's a sleigh, by the way.

25:48.147 --> 25:50.915
And see?
"Slugger."

25:50.917 --> 25:52.883
Yeah.
I built this and donated it

25:52.885 --> 25:55.686
to Mr. McGowan's cause.
Gentlemen, we are starting

25:55.688 --> 25:57.388
on the road back to Christmas.

25:57.390 --> 25:59.456
(chuckles)

25:59.458 --> 26:02.359
And here we are, for you, my princess.

26:02.361 --> 26:05.229
Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas.

26:05.231 --> 26:08.098
Thank you, my darling.
Thank you!

26:08.100 --> 26:10.935
And for you sir,
I believe this is a razor

26:10.937 --> 26:13.270
since you're
starting to shave.

26:13.272 --> 26:16.106
Merry Christmas.
Excuse me, sir,

26:16.108 --> 26:18.742
Uh, a word, please?
Of course, sonny.

26:18.744 --> 26:21.645
What is it?

26:21.647 --> 26:23.714
You were at the McGowan house
the other night, were you not?

26:23.716 --> 26:25.916
Indeed. We spoke, yes.

26:25.918 --> 26:28.519
May I ask where
you got these presents?

26:28.521 --> 26:31.288
I have important
work to do here.

26:31.290 --> 26:33.090
Do you mind?
Excuse me, sir.

26:33.092 --> 26:35.759
What? What?
What's your name?

26:35.761 --> 26:38.929
Isn't it apparent?
It's Kris Kringle!

26:38.931 --> 26:42.333
(Jackson gasps.)

26:42.335 --> 26:45.202
Sir, you need to come with us.
Why?

26:45.204 --> 26:48.005
We believe these
presents might be...

26:48.007 --> 26:51.342
stolen property.
Stolen property?

26:51.344 --> 26:54.445
How dare you?!
Come off it, you old coot.

26:54.447 --> 26:56.413
I will not go willingly.

26:56.415 --> 26:58.549
What do you think of that?

27:16.868 --> 27:19.837
(wind blowing and whistling)

27:19.839 --> 27:23.007
(knocking at the window)

27:38.857 --> 27:41.358
(growling)

27:41.360 --> 27:43.560
(screaming and more growling)

27:45.964 --> 27:49.333
Let me go!
I said let me go!

27:49.335 --> 27:52.169
I've never been
treated like this.
Bloody hell.

27:52.171 --> 27:55.372
You are the stupidest police
I've ever encountered!

27:55.374 --> 27:58.042
Murdoch?
One step ahead of you, sir.

28:00.779 --> 28:03.113
Good luck, sir.
Mary Pickford!

28:03.115 --> 28:05.749
This isn't right. All he was
doing was handing out presents.

28:05.751 --> 28:08.018
Excuse me, but
this is police business.

28:08.020 --> 28:11.321
You can't put him in jail.
Not before Christmas!

28:11.323 --> 28:14.758
I can do whatever I choose,
young lady. Now you, go home.

28:14.760 --> 28:18.262
(to himself): Bloody match girl!
<i>I'll ask you</i>

28:18.264 --> 28:21.865
once again, sir.
What is your name?

28:21.867 --> 28:26.403
Oh. It's, uh,
Kris Kringle.

28:26.405 --> 28:30.741
But some prefer
to call me Santa.

28:30.743 --> 28:33.343
Santa Claus.
Yes,

28:33.345 --> 28:35.746
yes, I understood that part.

28:35.748 --> 28:38.549
So you just happened

28:38.551 --> 28:42.019
to find those presents
in that warehouse?

28:42.021 --> 28:45.222
I did take the presents,

28:45.224 --> 28:47.725
but only to give
them to the children.

28:47.727 --> 28:50.894
I was planning to deliver
them on Christmas Eve,

28:50.896 --> 28:53.464
naturally.

28:53.466 --> 28:57.601
But then... I had
second thoughts.

28:57.603 --> 29:00.370
Why is that?

29:00.372 --> 29:03.073
Look at those children!

29:03.075 --> 29:06.110
They have no homes,
much less a chimney.

29:06.112 --> 29:09.046
What is your connection to Mr. Lynch?

29:09.048 --> 29:11.615
I have none!

29:11.617 --> 29:14.651
Alistair McGowan?
(Hums a negative.)

29:14.653 --> 29:17.654
Then how did you come
to be in his home?

29:17.656 --> 29:22.192
I know of all
Christmas events.

29:22.194 --> 29:24.828
Good thing I was there!

29:24.830 --> 29:28.165
The children needed me.

29:28.167 --> 29:31.068
And now you are in
possession of Mr. McGowan's

29:31.070 --> 29:33.504
stolen Christmas gifts.
Well...

29:33.506 --> 29:37.608
Again, I ask you, what is
your connection to Mr. Lynch?

29:37.610 --> 29:40.611
I. Have. None.

29:40.613 --> 29:42.880
I'm going to give you

29:42.882 --> 29:45.282
a moment to
reconsider that answer.

29:45.284 --> 29:49.019
OK.

29:49.021 --> 29:51.488
We only found a small
portion of the presents.

29:51.490 --> 29:54.158
There could be caches
scattered throughout the city.

29:54.160 --> 29:56.093
So... we could find them?

29:56.095 --> 29:58.562
Like an Easter Egg Hunt.
Wrong holiday, Jackson.

29:58.564 --> 30:01.231
That's not exactly true,
Higgins. In some cultures...

30:01.233 --> 30:04.568
the Finns for example -hiding
eggs is not unique to Easter

30:04.570 --> 30:06.870
It is indeed part of
their Christmas tradition.

30:06.872 --> 30:08.705
Thank you, George.
Sir.

30:08.707 --> 30:10.707
In spite of the man we have in cust...

30:10.709 --> 30:13.477
Latvians also, in Latvia. Sir.
Thank you.

30:13.479 --> 30:16.113
In spite of the man
that we have in custody,

30:16.115 --> 30:19.216
Cyrus Lynch remains our primary suspect.

30:19.218 --> 30:21.919
He didn't do it.
Doctor?

30:21.921 --> 30:23.921
Mr. McGowan's neck
was snapped. His body

30:23.923 --> 30:26.056
was also transported
after death.

30:26.058 --> 30:28.826
Given the relative sizes
of the two men, it's unlikely

30:28.828 --> 30:31.161
Mr. Lynch could have done it.
Well, he may have had

30:31.163 --> 30:33.730
an accomplice.
At any rate, Cyrus Lynch

30:33.732 --> 30:36.266
remains a person of interest
in this investigation.

30:36.268 --> 30:39.369
The lynchpin as it were.
(chuckles)

30:39.371 --> 30:42.806
Lynchpin.
Back to work, Gentlemen.

30:42.808 --> 30:45.609
(banter)

30:45.611 --> 30:48.712
I have someone that
I would like you to meet.

30:48.714 --> 30:50.480
Who?
Well, he...

30:50.482 --> 30:53.250
You'll see.

30:53.252 --> 30:56.620
(sound of metal door and keys)

30:56.622 --> 30:59.890
Hello, I'm Doctor Julia Ogden.
Oh!

30:59.892 --> 31:02.926
And you are?
Kringle. Kris Kringle.

31:02.928 --> 31:05.295
And you have to let me out of here.

31:05.297 --> 31:07.197
May I talk to you
for just one moment?

31:07.199 --> 31:10.234
Could we do that
a little later, please?

31:10.236 --> 31:13.237
This is my busy time.
And the elves,

31:13.239 --> 31:15.873
if they're left alone too long,
they tend to get fractious.

31:15.875 --> 31:17.875
I see.
Yeah!

31:17.877 --> 31:20.544
So you believe that you are...

31:20.546 --> 31:23.847
And the reindeer, someone
has to look after them,

31:23.849 --> 31:26.516
and you know who that
someone is, don't you?

31:26.518 --> 31:29.286
Well, you have to get me out of here.

31:29.288 --> 31:31.588
Alright

31:31.590 --> 31:33.891
Is there someone you know
that I could talk to?

31:33.893 --> 31:35.893
I can't release you
unless there's someone

31:35.895 --> 31:38.195
to surrender you to.

31:38.197 --> 31:41.231
My wife.

31:41.233 --> 31:44.001
Good! And how
can I find her?

31:44.003 --> 31:47.504
She's some distance
north of here.

31:50.208 --> 31:53.210
♪ Deck the hall with boughs of holly ♪

31:53.212 --> 31:56.213
♪ Fa la la la la la la la la ♪

31:56.215 --> 31:58.982
♪ Tis the season to be jolly

31:58.984 --> 32:01.585
♪ Fa la la la la  la la la la ♪

32:01.587 --> 32:03.620
It's a big city, George.
We won't find a man

32:03.622 --> 32:06.657
who doesn't want to be found.
Especially a man of means.

32:06.659 --> 32:08.926
He could be anywhere.
He could be in New York City

32:08.928 --> 32:12.129
or halfway
to San Francisco

32:12.131 --> 32:14.431
I can't believe we're
gonna miss Christmas

32:14.433 --> 32:16.466
because of the Inspector's stupid...

32:16.468 --> 32:18.669
George, why the heck
did you kick me??

32:18.671 --> 32:20.671
Evening, Inspector.
Ah, evening, lads.

32:20.673 --> 32:23.440
Uh, not at home?
I decided I could use

32:23.442 --> 32:25.609
a few before I could face
what the missus has got planned.

32:25.611 --> 32:28.512
Why, what's that sir?
Margaret want us to bob

32:28.514 --> 32:30.614
for bloody apples.
That sounds like fun, sir!

32:30.616 --> 32:32.916
Dunking my head
into a bucket

32:32.918 --> 32:35.519
of ice cold water is not
what I consider fun, Jackson.

32:35.521 --> 32:38.021
I hate this bloody season.
At least, at New Year's,

32:38.023 --> 32:40.057
all you have to do is get drunk
and kiss the wife! Ha ha ha!

32:40.059 --> 32:42.059
What about Easter, sir?
Don't get me started

32:42.061 --> 32:45.462
on that bloody ghost story.
Fancy another one?

32:45.464 --> 32:48.065
I should get home.
Yes, busy day.

32:48.067 --> 32:49.800
Killer to find and all that!

32:49.802 --> 32:52.602
I hope that's not sarcasm
I'm detecting, Higgins.

32:52.604 --> 32:56.406
Wouldn't dream of it, sir.
Hm. What about you, Crabtree?

32:56.408 --> 32:58.809
I'll have another, sir!
Ah, good lad.

32:58.811 --> 33:00.877
Landlord. Two pints
and two chasers

33:00.879 --> 33:02.879
and keep them coming.

33:02.881 --> 33:04.881
Ha ha!

33:04.883 --> 33:07.985
Sir, I feel like
you're missing the whole...

33:07.987 --> 33:10.721
spirit of the season.
Let me tell you

33:10.723 --> 33:13.390
about the season that is
supposedly full of good.

33:13.392 --> 33:16.960
It still contains
its fair share of evil.

33:16.962 --> 33:19.963
What do you mean, sir?
Oh Crabtree.

33:22.033 --> 33:24.968
It's a holiday for
hypocrites. A holiday

33:24.970 --> 33:27.304
where the Godless can feel pious.

33:27.306 --> 33:30.640
Where the greedy can
pretend to be generous.

33:30.642 --> 33:33.744
I'd be happy if the
whole thing never existed.

33:33.746 --> 33:37.214
I'll see you tomorrow,

33:37.216 --> 33:39.750
George Crabtree.

33:39.752 --> 33:42.185
Woman of the house!

33:44.122 --> 33:47.724
Thomas! Honestly!
(He laughs.)

33:47.726 --> 33:51.995
Come here, Margaret.
What do you-Oh!

33:53.865 --> 33:56.733
That's enough of that.

34:19.924 --> 34:23.093
<i>Spend Christmas together?</i>

34:23.095 --> 34:26.063
<i>Oh, no I don't think so,</i>
<i>George. I have plans.</i>

34:26.065 --> 34:27.931
<i>I'm sorry, George,</i>
<i>but Mother insists</i>

34:27.933 --> 34:31.201
<i>that Christmas be</i>
<i>for family only.</i>

34:38.076 --> 34:40.477
<i>A day with nothing more</i>
<i>than each other's company</i>

34:40.479 --> 34:42.245
<i>is all we want.</i>
<i>-</i>  <i>On Christmas? Hardly.</i>

34:42.247 --> 34:44.614
<i>There's never anything for a</i>
<i>single person at Christmas.</i>

34:44.616 --> 34:47.017
<i>I'd be happy if the whole</i>
<i>thing never existed.</i>

34:52.423 --> 34:55.192
(panting and moaning aloud))

34:55.194 --> 34:58.195
Sir! What is it?

34:58.197 --> 35:00.964
There's something in the
woods, it was coming after me!

35:00.966 --> 35:03.633
Something? What
do you mean, something?

35:03.635 --> 35:05.635
A creature. And
it was carrying a body

35:05.637 --> 35:08.939
as if it was a feather pillow.
A creature?

35:08.941 --> 35:13.176
Yeah! Horns on his
head. Blood-red eyes.

35:13.178 --> 35:17.514
Where is this creature now?
In the woods. That way.

35:17.516 --> 35:20.350
If I was you,
I'd get help.

35:20.352 --> 35:22.953
(panting and moaning)

35:27.692 --> 35:30.694
Hello!

35:30.696 --> 35:32.696
Is anyone there?

35:49.714 --> 35:52.582
(sniffing)

36:07.698 --> 36:10.967
Inspector Brackenreid!
I'm not releasing him.

36:10.969 --> 36:13.069
That's not why I'm here.
Even though you would

36:13.071 --> 36:15.872
if you had a heart.
What do you want?

36:15.874 --> 36:19.075
I'm assisting in a charity
drive for the City's orphans

36:19.077 --> 36:21.678
and The Hospital for Sick
Children. I was hoping

36:21.680 --> 36:23.513
some of the Constables
could help with the procuring

36:23.515 --> 36:26.316
of donations.
Well, we are attempting

36:26.318 --> 36:28.852
to solve a murder and a
robbery at the McGowan Mansion.

36:28.854 --> 36:31.855
I know sir, but if you fail,
the children could use help...

36:31.857 --> 36:34.090
Maybe you should try
the fire department.

36:34.092 --> 36:37.360
Sir, a moment?
What is it, Crabtree?

36:37.362 --> 36:39.963
Sir, I saw something
unusual last night.

36:39.965 --> 36:42.165
Well, you'd had a few.
I know,

36:42.167 --> 36:45.969
but, sir, I saw... I saw
some tracks in the woods.

36:45.971 --> 36:48.872
What'd they look like?
Like nothing I'd ever seen

36:48.874 --> 36:52.075
before. They weren't quite
human, a little bit like a paw,

36:52.077 --> 36:55.178
but at the same time,
like no animal I've ever seen.

37:03.020 --> 37:07.657
I am running out of time!
You are destroying Christmas!

37:07.659 --> 37:12.195
Sir. I have no choice.
You are so sure,

37:12.197 --> 37:14.564
aren't you?
Excuse me?

37:14.566 --> 37:17.100
How can you be
convinced that I am not

37:17.102 --> 37:19.603
who I say I am?

37:29.046 --> 37:31.047
Bloody Christmas!

37:31.049 --> 37:32.782
They're supposed
to be solving a murder.

37:32.784 --> 37:34.751
Sir, they're merely
exchanging gifts.

37:34.753 --> 37:36.586
(sighing): Come on. Let's go.
Where?

37:36.588 --> 37:39.289
The Mayor's making a speech.
All ranking city officials

37:39.291 --> 37:41.591
are to be in attendance.
I'm a ranking

37:41.593 --> 37:43.493
city official, now?
No, and you're never likely

37:43.495 --> 37:45.362
to be, but I could
use the company.

37:45.364 --> 37:47.931
Higgins, you twit! What are you
doing with that bloody tree!

37:47.933 --> 37:50.300
Detective Murdoch said
it would be alright.

37:53.804 --> 37:56.139
Put down the tree
and find Mr. Lynch!

37:56.141 --> 37:58.642
Not here, Jackson. Come...
Sorry.

37:58.644 --> 38:01.278
Come about! Come on!
Excuse me, sir!

38:01.280 --> 38:02.979
Sorry!
Watch out, sir!

38:02.981 --> 38:05.415
(Brackenreid grunts.)

38:05.417 --> 38:08.184
And thank you for coming. Your
generosity is the real message

38:08.186 --> 38:10.920
of the spirit of Christmas. To
think that citizens of Toron...

38:10.922 --> 38:12.656
Thank you, Miss Pickford.

38:12.658 --> 38:14.991
Oh!
(applause)

38:16.627 --> 38:19.863
To reiterate what our own
Little Match Girl was saying,

38:19.865 --> 38:24.167
I thank you all for
donating to our cause.

38:24.169 --> 38:26.836
All our hearts were
saddened by the untimely

38:26.838 --> 38:30.340
demise of Mr. McGowan,
a man who spread joy

38:30.342 --> 38:33.476
for so many years. It seemed
the spirit of Christmas

38:33.478 --> 38:36.746
had passed us by, but you rose

38:36.748 --> 38:39.749
and took up the torch. And
the man who held it firmest

38:39.751 --> 38:42.452
was none other than Cyrus Lynch.

38:42.454 --> 38:46.122
Since the death of Mr. McGowan,
I have been in communication

38:46.124 --> 38:49.225
with Mr. Lynch, who has
helped spearhead this drive

38:49.227 --> 38:51.695
with a sizable donation.
(Oohs and aahs)

38:51.697 --> 38:55.098
The City of Toronto
owes him a debt of gratitude.

38:55.100 --> 38:57.434
It would seem Mr. Lynch
is alive and well.

38:57.436 --> 38:59.536
And now he's playing
at being Saint bloody Nick!

38:59.538 --> 39:02.772
A perverse motive, but
that could explain the murder.

39:02.774 --> 39:05.442
...to give a gift
to the City of Toronto.

39:05.444 --> 39:07.877
And it gives me
great honour

39:07.879 --> 39:10.313
to unveil it today.

39:10.315 --> 39:12.349
(excited reactions)

39:12.351 --> 39:15.885
(reactions of horror)

39:15.887 --> 39:19.055
Good Lord.

39:19.057 --> 39:21.591
That's bloody Lynch!

39:21.593 --> 39:25.128
(roar of fire ignition and screams)

39:25.130 --> 39:27.831
Get back everyone! Get back!

39:27.833 --> 39:31.067
Everybody, back!

39:57.628 --> 40:00.964
ible.
This is not good at all.

40:00.966 --> 40:03.266
Why didn't you inform us
that you were in contact

40:03.268 --> 40:05.201
with Cyrus Lynch?
We were looking for him.

40:05.203 --> 40:07.604
I didn't know that.
There were

40:07.606 --> 40:10.073
posters all over town.
I've been very busy

40:10.075 --> 40:11.975
coordinating this
charity drive. I don't

40:11.977 --> 40:13.943
have time to be
looking at posters.

40:13.945 --> 40:16.579
Mr. Mayor. What did you
believe was in the crate?

40:16.581 --> 40:18.948
I was told it was
a likeness of myself.

40:18.950 --> 40:21.184
And you thought it would
be a good idea to unveil it

40:21.186 --> 40:24.220
at this celebration.
Every little bit counts.

40:24.222 --> 40:27.390
My Lord, the carnage.

40:27.392 --> 40:30.660
All our efforts, up in smoke.
Sir, when did you

40:30.662 --> 40:33.730
last see Cyrus Lynch?
I never saw him.

40:33.732 --> 40:36.433
The only means of communication
was through a third party.

40:36.435 --> 40:38.868
Who was?

40:38.870 --> 40:40.937
I have no idea.

40:40.939 --> 40:44.207
All I can say is that once
the presents started to arrive,

40:44.209 --> 40:46.943
I had no reason to believe
anything was amiss.

40:46.945 --> 40:50.346
Mr. Mayor, it's time
to control the damage.

40:50.348 --> 40:52.816
Gentlemen, I have to go.
Inspector Brackenreid,

40:52.818 --> 40:55.685
my office will be in contact
later, this afternoon.

40:55.687 --> 40:58.254
I have a task for you.

40:58.256 --> 41:00.256
There will be many in our
fair city who will not see

41:00.258 --> 41:03.326
Christmas this year.
And they'd be very

41:03.328 --> 41:06.763
disappointed not to get
to see that statue.

41:06.765 --> 41:08.698
Mr. Mayor,

41:08.700 --> 41:10.934
what did I tell you about
talking to the police

41:10.936 --> 41:13.903
on your own?
Hm.

41:20.444 --> 41:23.346
You have to eat something.

41:23.348 --> 41:27.183
I heard what happened at City Hall.

41:27.185 --> 41:30.320
Yes. It was terrible.

41:30.322 --> 41:32.789
The world needs me.
You know that,

41:32.791 --> 41:35.592
don't you, Constable?
I can't help you.

41:35.594 --> 41:38.628
Yes, you can.
You know it's wrong

41:38.630 --> 41:41.998
to keep me in this cell,
don't you?

41:42.000 --> 41:46.469
And I know something else, too.
What's that?

41:46.471 --> 41:50.607
You have the spirit of Christmas within you.

41:50.609 --> 41:55.812
And you do know who I truly am.

42:03.521 --> 42:05.588
Eat something. Please.

42:11.495 --> 42:13.630
And we've been instructed
by the Mayor's office

42:13.632 --> 42:15.999
to do whatever we can to
bring in gifts and donations.

42:16.001 --> 42:18.001
Are we still looking
for the stolen presents, sir?

42:18.003 --> 42:21.070
Yes, Higgins.
And the murderer, sir?

42:21.072 --> 42:23.573
We're the police, Crabtree,
what do you think?

42:23.575 --> 42:25.642
Right.
Then get to it. And Jackson,

42:25.644 --> 42:28.711
you're not on holiday yet.
Yes, sir.

42:28.713 --> 42:31.347
Ah, Murdoch.
What have you got?

42:31.349 --> 42:33.917
Julia's examining
the body, sir.

42:33.919 --> 42:36.786
But it's safe to say that
Lynch didn't kill McGowan?

42:36.788 --> 42:39.022
We don't know that.
Sirs,

42:39.024 --> 42:41.691
even if Lynch was the murderer,
somebody's killed him now,

42:41.693 --> 42:44.694
so we have another crime.
What are you still doing here?

42:44.696 --> 42:46.896
I think my efforts are better
spent here on the investigation.

42:46.898 --> 42:49.899
Alright, Crabtree,
what do you think?

42:49.901 --> 42:53.336
I think a third party
killed McGowan and Lynch.

42:53.338 --> 42:56.005
Oh? And why
would they do that?

42:56.007 --> 42:58.074
It would appear, sirs,
for the sole purpose

42:58.076 --> 43:00.777
of destroying Christmas.

43:00.779 --> 43:05.014
Gentlemen. My office.

43:10.020 --> 43:13.823
(sighing): Krampus!

43:14.425 --> 43:18.061
Who?
Kram...

43:18.063 --> 43:19.429
Pus. Krampus.

43:19.431 --> 43:20.597
With a K.

43:20.599 --> 43:24.467
I'm sorry, sir,
I don't follow.

43:24.469 --> 43:26.803
When I was a boy back in Yorkshire,

43:26.805 --> 43:30.373
my father told me the story of Krampus.

43:30.375 --> 43:32.842
Krampus is a creature
that emerges from the woods

43:32.844 --> 43:36.746
at Christmas time. But he
didn't bring gifts to children,

43:36.748 --> 43:40.316
he punished them. And if he was
in a particularly foul mood,

43:40.318 --> 43:43.052
he devoured them.
Devoured them, sir?

43:43.054 --> 43:47.423
Yes. In fact, he punished
all who celebrated Christmas.

43:47.425 --> 43:50.059
So, did he devour adults as well?

43:50.061 --> 43:52.261
I don't know.
I mean, I suppose if you had

43:52.263 --> 43:54.864
to choose between devouring a
child or some old person...

43:54.866 --> 43:57.300
Alright, that's
enough, George. Sir,

43:57.302 --> 44:01.971
you believe this Krampus is
responsible for our murders?

44:01.973 --> 44:03.973
Mock me if you want Murdoch,
but I'll tell you this:

44:03.975 --> 44:05.808
I've seen him. When I was a boy,

44:05.810 --> 44:08.211
he appeared
at my bedroom window.

44:11.315 --> 44:14.217
You had a nightmare
as a child.

44:14.219 --> 44:16.619
But I hardly
think it responsible

44:16.621 --> 44:19.889
for two murders...
in Toronto... today.

44:19.891 --> 44:23.192
How do you kill it?
According to my father,

44:23.194 --> 44:25.862
Krampus can't be killed.
I knew it.

44:25.864 --> 44:28.631
And I think he's here, now.

44:28.633 --> 44:31.968
Sir?
(deep sigh)

44:31.970 --> 44:34.537
Yesterday I was walking
through the woods...

44:34.539 --> 44:36.873
and I felt its presence,

44:36.875 --> 44:39.876
just like I did all those years ago.

44:39.878 --> 44:41.878
All right, sir.

44:41.880 --> 44:45.815
Would you be willing
to describe this presence?

44:45.817 --> 44:47.917
Don't be smart, Murdoch.

44:47.919 --> 44:49.919
Alright, let me see.

44:49.921 --> 44:52.488
All I remember
is the glowing eyes,

44:52.490 --> 44:55.158
the beastly feet and the horns.

44:55.160 --> 44:58.594
Crabtree saw the same.
George?

44:58.596 --> 45:01.064
Sir, not to the same level
of detail as the Inspector,

45:01.066 --> 45:04.934
but I did see...
some very unusual tracks.

45:04.936 --> 45:07.837
Where was this?
On Bells Bridge.

45:07.839 --> 45:11.007
A tramp had reported
seeing a huge figure

45:11.009 --> 45:14.577
carrying a body over his
shoulder through the woods.

45:14.579 --> 45:17.246
That body could have
been that of Mr. Lynch.

45:17.248 --> 45:19.348
Did you see this body?
No.

45:19.350 --> 45:21.350
Did you see the "beast?"
No.

45:21.352 --> 45:25.054
Did you see anything to
support this Krampus notion?

45:25.056 --> 45:27.690
Well, sir, as I said,
I did see the tracks.

45:27.692 --> 45:30.159
What about this?

45:30.161 --> 45:32.895
That looks very much
like a goat's horn.

45:32.897 --> 45:34.897
Like a horn. But perhaps

45:34.899 --> 45:37.333
not simply a goat's horn.

45:39.837 --> 45:42.205
Respectfully, Sir,

45:42.207 --> 45:45.742
there is no such
thing as Krampus.

45:45.744 --> 45:48.177
No such thing as St. Nick.

45:48.179 --> 45:50.947
No such thing as
the ghost of Christmas past,

45:50.949 --> 45:53.850
or elves...
Please don't say that, sir.

45:53.852 --> 45:56.552
There's no Kris Kringle.
Not you, too, Doctor!

45:56.554 --> 45:58.755
I was coming by
to see how he was faring.

45:58.757 --> 46:01.424
Did someone let him out?
Not without your authority,

46:01.426 --> 46:04.127
Julia.
Maybe his elves rescued him.

46:04.129 --> 46:07.196
Jackson, what are you doing?

46:07.198 --> 46:09.932
Decorating the station, sir.
Well, stop it.

46:09.934 --> 46:12.869
We've got two murderers to find.
And possibly a monster.

46:12.871 --> 46:15.772
George?
Don't get him started.

46:15.774 --> 46:17.540
(Jackson): A monster?

46:17.542 --> 46:20.409
Despite how he was found,
it seems Mr. Lynch

46:20.411 --> 46:22.979
died in the same
manner as Mr. McGowan.

46:22.981 --> 46:25.982
A snapped neck.
So it seems likely that

46:25.984 --> 46:27.650
the same person
murdered both of them.

46:27.652 --> 46:30.419
It's possible. And I found

46:30.421 --> 46:32.488
these scratch marks on his body.

46:32.490 --> 46:35.958
He was clawed.
That makes sense.

46:35.960 --> 46:39.028
Inspector?
The Inspector seems

46:39.030 --> 46:42.598
to believe that supernatural
forces are at work here.

46:42.600 --> 46:44.700
Oh, I see.
Whereas

46:44.702 --> 46:47.904
I prefer to stay
in the real world.

46:52.576 --> 46:54.710
(sleigh bells)

46:54.712 --> 46:57.547
Whoa!
(horse snorting)

47:08.792 --> 47:11.394
I just don't feel like
celebrating this year.

47:11.396 --> 47:14.831
I can understand
that, Mrs. McGowan.

47:14.833 --> 47:16.833
Thank you for seeing me.

47:16.835 --> 47:20.403
Oh, of course, I'm just
not sure how I can help.

47:20.405 --> 47:22.839
I take it you've heard about
the unfortunate circumstance

47:22.841 --> 47:24.707
that befell Mr. Lynch.

47:24.709 --> 47:26.709
I have.

47:26.711 --> 47:28.845
And do you still believe
him to be responsible

47:28.847 --> 47:31.647
for your husband's death?
I do.

47:31.649 --> 47:34.350
I hate to trouble
you with this,

47:34.352 --> 47:37.353
but I will need you to
account for your whereabouts.

47:37.355 --> 47:39.021
You're not
seriously suggesting..?

47:39.023 --> 47:42.024
Is everything alright?

47:42.026 --> 47:45.661
I take it you've heard about
the death of our prime suspect.

47:45.663 --> 47:49.699
I have. And I must
admit surprise.

47:49.701 --> 47:52.902
I was of the sincere belief
that Cyrus Lynch was responsible

47:52.904 --> 47:55.504
for the death of Mr. McGowan.
We both were.

47:58.342 --> 48:01.444
Well, thank you.
If you think of anyone else...

48:01.446 --> 48:04.580
Of course.

48:04.582 --> 48:07.250
Robert Kratchet.

48:09.186 --> 48:12.722
You should talk to Robert Kratchet.

48:17.127 --> 48:19.862
Hi sir. Can I borrow your hat?

48:19.864 --> 48:21.931
Oh, I'm sorry miss,

48:21.933 --> 48:24.200
but I only have the one.

48:24.202 --> 48:27.370
(giggles)

48:27.372 --> 48:31.007
Oh no! Help!

48:31.009 --> 48:34.911
Help! Help! Please let me in!
I'm being attacked.

48:34.913 --> 48:37.113
(knocking)

48:37.115 --> 48:39.916
I was chief of operations
at McGowan Manufacturing

48:39.918 --> 48:42.919
for almost ten years. Not anymore.

48:42.921 --> 48:45.955
Was Mr. McGowan unsatisfied with your work?

48:45.957 --> 48:48.391
He didn't fire me
I left.

48:48.393 --> 48:51.160
Oh. Why?
You know what he did

48:51.162 --> 48:54.163
this year? He docked our wages
so he could buy more presents.

48:54.165 --> 48:56.165
The only thing Alistair McGowan
ever did was make himself

48:56.167 --> 48:59.268
look good at other's expense.

48:59.270 --> 49:01.270
A number of the lads and
myself were making the move

49:01.272 --> 49:04.473
to Lynch Fabrications.
McGowan's chief competitor?

49:04.475 --> 49:07.410
Did McGowan
know about this?

49:07.412 --> 49:09.445
Mr. Lynch walked into
our plant and offered up

49:09.447 --> 49:11.847
the jobs himself. He must have
heard that McGowan was docking

49:11.849 --> 49:14.450
our wages. Struck
while the iron was hot.

49:14.452 --> 49:17.520
And how did Mr. McGowan react?

49:17.522 --> 49:19.956
The two of them actually got
into a fight on the shop floor.

49:19.958 --> 49:23.326
No?
Mr. McGowan got the better of him.

49:23.328 --> 49:26.629
You don't seem upset
by Mr. MaGowan's murder.

49:26.631 --> 49:28.664
As far as I'm concerned,
the old skinflint

49:28.666 --> 49:30.666
got what he deserved.

49:30.668 --> 49:32.835
And how do you feel
about Mr. Lynch's death?

49:32.837 --> 49:35.604
As long as the job he promised
is still waiting for me,

49:35.606 --> 49:38.274
that's all that matters.

49:41.945 --> 49:44.880
Ma'am, please...

49:44.882 --> 49:47.316
Would you like to make
a donation? Anything helps.

49:47.318 --> 49:49.785
Ma'am could you
please help?

49:49.787 --> 49:52.488
What would be the point?
It'll just get stolen.

49:52.490 --> 49:55.624
And Happy Christmas to you, too.

49:55.626 --> 49:58.661
I haven't had a single donation.

49:58.663 --> 50:01.430
I put these in myself.

50:01.432 --> 50:04.166
Higgins. Krampus
is winning.

50:04.168 --> 50:06.702
Who's Krampus? What
are you talking about?

50:06.704 --> 50:09.038
The Inspector believes

50:09.040 --> 50:11.640
that there is a malevolent
spirit loose on the streets

50:11.642 --> 50:14.643
of Toronto and its sole aim...

50:14.645 --> 50:16.979
is to ruin Christmas.

50:16.981 --> 50:19.248
The Inspector said that?
Yes, he did.

50:19.250 --> 50:22.051
And look, he's right!

50:22.053 --> 50:25.321
(phone ringing)

50:31.495 --> 50:33.929
Constable George Crabtree.

50:39.936 --> 50:42.705
I'm sorry. No more
questions, gentlemen.

50:42.707 --> 50:45.741
This man needs
medical attention.

50:46.910 --> 50:48.911
He's taken a blow

50:48.913 --> 50:51.680
to the head. We should
take him to the hospital.

50:51.682 --> 50:54.350
Sir, what happened?

50:54.352 --> 50:57.286
I was closing up
for the night.

50:57.288 --> 51:00.823
I heard a noise. Something
was destroying the carousel.

51:00.825 --> 51:03.692
Something?
It wasn't human.

51:03.694 --> 51:05.861
It was a foul
smelling creature.

51:05.863 --> 51:08.597
It walked on two legs,
but it wasn't a man.

51:08.599 --> 51:11.834
I turned to run, but
it struck me from behind.

51:11.836 --> 51:15.538
And you told
those reporters that?

51:15.540 --> 51:17.540
People need to know!

51:17.542 --> 51:19.975
William. I have to take him.
(grunt from the man)

51:19.977 --> 51:22.411
Sir, did you hear that?
I did.

51:22.413 --> 51:25.214
Do you believe me now?
No, George. I do not.

51:25.216 --> 51:28.317
Sir...
(Blows out air.)

51:31.054 --> 51:34.657
Krampus. Krampus.

51:39.229 --> 51:41.730
Gentlemen, gentlemen.
One at a time, please.

51:41.732 --> 51:44.767
Detective, is the city safe?
As safe as it ever was.

51:44.769 --> 51:46.802
Well, how can you say that?
We have two murders

51:46.804 --> 51:49.672
and a beast roaming the streets.
We are investigating

51:49.674 --> 51:52.141
the deaths of Mr. Lynch
and Mr. McGowan and we will

51:52.143 --> 51:55.111
come to a conclusion.
And what about the beast?

51:55.113 --> 51:57.813
Uh... gentlemen,

51:57.815 --> 51:59.882
I highly doubt that a beast

51:59.884 --> 52:03.552
is wandering the streets of
Toronto, and so should you.

52:03.554 --> 52:06.922
That's all for now. Thank you.
How did this Krampus

52:06.924 --> 52:10.359
arrange passage?
Have you checked
the steamship lines?

52:23.406 --> 52:25.608
You called for me?

52:25.610 --> 52:28.611
I did indeed,
Constable Jackson.

52:28.613 --> 52:31.247
I know what you did.

52:31.249 --> 52:33.182
I don't know what you're...

52:33.184 --> 52:36.619
You released Mr. Kringle.
I did not, I...

52:36.621 --> 52:40.389
Well, he...

52:40.391 --> 52:42.791
Ahem!
I'm not a fool, Jackson,

52:42.793 --> 52:45.661
so don't play me for one.

52:45.663 --> 52:49.131
I don't think it's in his
nature to cause harm, ma'am.

52:49.133 --> 52:51.834
(quick sigh)

52:54.070 --> 52:57.506
I know you mean well,
but you're not qualified

52:57.508 --> 52:59.341
to make that judgment.

53:01.278 --> 53:03.479
Now, come with me.

53:06.616 --> 53:09.084
Can't we just let him go?
Jackson!

53:09.086 --> 53:11.153
Christmas is my favourite
time of year. Yet now,

53:11.155 --> 53:13.989
it doesn't feel the same.
Well, two murders just days

53:13.991 --> 53:16.825
before the holidays do tend
to dampen the Christmas Spirit.

53:16.827 --> 53:20.462
There he is.
Sir!

53:20.464 --> 53:23.098
Sir!
Go! Go!

53:23.100 --> 53:24.900
Stop. You there. Stop!

53:24.902 --> 53:27.636
Oh! Ah...
AH!

53:27.638 --> 53:29.538
Jackson.

53:29.540 --> 53:33.142
Are you alright?
Yes, Doctor.

53:33.144 --> 53:36.712
Well, you know what they say
about dashing in the snow:

53:36.714 --> 53:38.681
"head over heels you go."

53:38.683 --> 53:41.317
Very good, Doctor.

53:46.723 --> 53:48.657
George!

53:51.394 --> 53:54.063
George!
Sir.

53:54.065 --> 53:56.198
Is this your doing?

53:56.200 --> 53:58.400
Sir, he remains
a viable suspect.

53:58.402 --> 54:01.136
No, "it" does not.

54:01.138 --> 54:04.206
George, we would be much
closer to solving this case

54:04.208 --> 54:07.710
if you and the Inspector would
reign in your flights of fancy.

54:07.712 --> 54:10.746
Sir.

54:10.748 --> 54:12.815
Take this.

54:24.728 --> 54:27.229
As you can see, the boy
you sent us is doing well.

54:27.231 --> 54:29.398
He'll be released soon?
A woman from the orphanage

54:29.400 --> 54:32.101
is coming for him.

54:32.103 --> 54:34.203
Is it always
so chilly in here?

54:34.205 --> 54:37.539
We do our best. But
when a chill wind blows,

54:37.541 --> 54:39.975
well, it plays havoc on our ability

54:39.977 --> 54:42.878
to care for the early borns.
I'm sure.

54:42.880 --> 54:45.180
You know, my husband,
Detective William Murdoch,

54:45.182 --> 54:48.984
is quite an ingenious man.
He may be able to help you.

54:48.986 --> 54:52.288
Thank you. We'd appreciate
any help we can get.

54:59.963 --> 55:02.097
It has nothing to do
with who Mr. McGowan did

55:02.099 --> 55:05.734
or didn't cheat. Krampus
is responsible for all this.

55:05.736 --> 55:07.936
I'm sorry sir,
but I find it difficult

55:07.938 --> 55:10.606
to believe that a demon...
You believe in the existence

55:10.608 --> 55:12.975
of good, do you not?
Of course.

55:12.977 --> 55:14.610
Well then you can believe
in the spirit of evil.

55:14.612 --> 55:17.780
You can believe that
someone can hate Christmas.

55:17.782 --> 55:20.416
Well, all people are capable

55:20.418 --> 55:23.252
of hating something,
so that is possible.

55:23.254 --> 55:25.487
But Christmas...
There are plenty of reasons

55:25.489 --> 55:28.324
to hate Christmas, Murdoch.
The poor hate Christmas,

55:28.326 --> 55:31.327
the lonely hate Christmas,
the greedy hate Christmas.

55:31.329 --> 55:35.097
And I hate Christmas.
Sir...

55:39.035 --> 55:41.170
Every year when
I was a young boy,

55:41.172 --> 55:44.506
I asked for
one small present:

55:44.508 --> 55:48.043
a figure of a Prussian
cavalry officer. And every year,

55:48.045 --> 55:51.313
nothing. Oh, I know
my father tried,

55:51.315 --> 55:54.616
but every year your face
got rubbed deeper in it.

55:54.618 --> 55:58.654
For a lot of people, Christmas
isn't St. Nick, it's Krampus.

55:58.656 --> 56:02.191
I doubt very much that Kramp...
Christmas is nothing but greed

56:02.193 --> 56:05.861
and crushing disappointments.
It is the time of Krampus.

56:05.863 --> 56:09.498
But it doesn't have to be.

56:09.500 --> 56:12.334
I just wish the whole
bloody holiday would go away.

56:12.336 --> 56:16.405
Sir, Christmas is worth saving.

56:16.407 --> 56:18.340
It really is.

56:33.156 --> 56:35.157
I have specimen containers
that would be suitable.

56:35.159 --> 56:37.760
Wonderful.
I'll have someone bring them.

56:37.762 --> 56:40.162
This is going
to work perfectly.

56:40.164 --> 56:43.098
And don't you be late tonight.

56:43.100 --> 56:46.168
It is Christmas Eve.
(snicker)

56:49.839 --> 56:51.974
(conversations)

56:54.844 --> 56:56.845
(man): Merry Christmas!
Merry Christmas!

56:56.847 --> 56:59.915
This is the best you could do?
People are skint.

56:59.917 --> 57:03.318
Skint?
Tapped out. Without money.

57:03.320 --> 57:06.054
Bleakest Christmas on record.
And during your term

57:06.056 --> 57:09.191
in office, sir. What a pity.
And Happy Christmas

57:09.193 --> 57:11.927
to you too, Inspector.

57:11.929 --> 57:14.596
Right, you lot, get back
to work. Oh, and you two

57:14.598 --> 57:16.899
are not excluded either.

57:29.012 --> 57:31.580
(inaudible words)

57:53.336 --> 57:55.871
Right, everyone,

57:55.873 --> 57:58.440
go home.
Home, sir?

57:58.442 --> 58:01.443
You heard me, Higgins?
Now clear off before I change my mind.

58:01.445 --> 58:03.378
Inspector?
We're not going to find him

58:03.380 --> 58:05.581
tonight, Murdoch. We'll
pick it up after the holidays.

58:05.583 --> 58:08.217
Merry Christmas, sir!
Quite.

58:08.219 --> 58:10.219
Merry Christmas everyone.

58:10.221 --> 58:12.054
Tomorrow's going
to be my lucky day!

58:12.056 --> 58:15.324
George,

58:15.326 --> 58:17.326
can you help me
pack up this box?

58:17.328 --> 58:19.394
Ah.

58:21.331 --> 58:24.500
And accompany me home.

58:24.502 --> 58:27.836
Really, sir?!
Oh thank you, sir!

58:27.838 --> 58:30.372
Oh, I didn't mean...
O sir, that is wonderful.

58:30.374 --> 58:32.407
I thought my Christmas Eve
was going to be bleak, but...

58:32.409 --> 58:35.811
your place at the Windsor is
just lovely, and the food is

58:35.813 --> 58:38.180
to die for. And Doctor Ogden,
sir, she is lovely company.

58:38.182 --> 58:40.549
Really, I think that's
important. And very attractive.

58:40.551 --> 58:43.252
As are you. I'm sure
if you asked any lady,

58:43.254 --> 58:45.153
they would say as much.

58:46.923 --> 58:50.359
Julia? Julia, where
are you, I've brought a...

58:50.361 --> 58:52.628
Unwrap me, William.

58:52.630 --> 58:55.797
...visitor.
Good gracious!

58:58.401 --> 59:01.737
Sir, I-I-I should go.
No, George...

59:01.739 --> 59:04.606
(sighing): I think
the moment may have passed.

59:09.746 --> 59:12.748
George. Would you like
a breast or a leg?

59:12.750 --> 59:14.983
Oh, uh... whichever
is appropriate.

59:16.920 --> 59:20.789
Thank you.
George.

59:20.791 --> 59:23.759
Why are you wearing only one sock?

59:23.761 --> 59:25.994
The other one is hanging on the tree, sir.

59:25.996 --> 59:28.764
The tree?

59:28.766 --> 59:30.732
Yes. You don't have a hearth
so I thought I thought

59:30.734 --> 59:33.769
that would be the best place...
Do you not hang your stockings

59:33.771 --> 59:37.205
at Christmas?

59:37.207 --> 59:40.809
Well, you must!

59:40.811 --> 59:43.745
♪ Good King Wenceslas  looked down ♪

59:43.747 --> 59:46.081
♪ On the feast of Stephen

59:46.083 --> 59:48.684
♪ When the snow  lay round about ♪

59:48.686 --> 59:50.919
Are we supposed to
put something in them?

59:50.921 --> 59:54.356
I have no idea.
And is he staying over?

59:54.358 --> 59:56.892
I believe that's
the expectation.

59:56.894 --> 59:59.962
Let's just make
the best of it, shall we?

59:59.964 --> 1:00:02.698
(George still singing)

1:00:02.700 --> 1:00:05.968
Looks wonderful, George!

1:00:05.970 --> 1:00:09.571
And now...
(little snicker)

1:00:09.573 --> 1:00:12.307
(electrical buzzing)
<i>Oh! William! </i>

1:00:12.309 --> 1:00:14.943
They're quite strong, sir.

1:00:14.945 --> 1:00:18.080
I'm sure it can
easily be corrected.

1:00:20.583 --> 1:00:24.019
Would you like a sherry,
George? This could take a while.

1:00:32.595 --> 1:00:34.863
Another mint. Doctor?

1:00:37.166 --> 1:00:39.868
I'm fine. William,
how much longer?

1:00:39.870 --> 1:00:42.804
This should do it.

1:00:42.806 --> 1:00:45.007
(more electrical buzzing)

1:00:45.009 --> 1:00:47.309
<i>Perhaps you</i>
<i>overcompensated, sir.</i>

1:00:47.311 --> 1:00:50.545
Something must have caused
a short circuit somehow.

1:00:50.547 --> 1:00:53.015
I'll ring down to the desk,
see if they can replace

1:00:53.017 --> 1:00:55.350
the fuse.
I may pop out

1:00:55.352 --> 1:00:58.320
for a brief constitutional.

1:00:58.322 --> 1:01:00.288
And for goodness sake,
William, keep your hands off

1:01:00.290 --> 1:01:03.892
the lights!
(doors closing)

1:01:03.894 --> 1:01:06.628
(melodramatic music)

1:01:06.630 --> 1:01:10.232
(hubbub)

1:01:13.369 --> 1:01:15.971
<i>Father, , did you see that </i>
<i>train set I was talking about? </i>

1:01:22.311 --> 1:01:24.713
It's not fair! It's not fair!

1:01:24.715 --> 1:01:27.182
Everyone gets a present!
Everyone but me!

1:01:27.184 --> 1:01:29.751
I made you a present.
I don't want something

1:01:29.753 --> 1:01:33.355
stupid and homemade.
I'm trying my best, son.

1:01:33.357 --> 1:01:35.824
I hate you!

1:01:40.363 --> 1:01:42.431
(conversations)

1:01:48.538 --> 1:01:52.207
Hey, you there! Stop!

1:01:52.209 --> 1:01:54.476
There is somewhere I have to be.

1:01:54.478 --> 1:01:58.013
Well, hold up a moment!
I'm in a tremendous hurry!

1:01:58.015 --> 1:02:00.449
And you should be in custody!

1:02:00.451 --> 1:02:02.684
What? Aah!

1:02:02.686 --> 1:02:05.554
I can't be!
Not tonight!

1:02:05.556 --> 1:02:09.357
Surely you must understand who I am?

1:02:09.359 --> 1:02:11.693
Sir, why do you
insist on this ruse?

1:02:11.695 --> 1:02:14.162
How can you believe
you are who you say you are?

1:02:14.164 --> 1:02:16.565
And why do you believe I'm not?

1:02:16.567 --> 1:02:18.967
To use your parlance,

1:02:18.969 --> 1:02:21.903
I certainly fit the profile.

1:02:21.905 --> 1:02:24.306
And answer me this:

1:02:24.308 --> 1:02:27.476
I overheard one of your constables say

1:02:27.478 --> 1:02:30.645
you were searching for Krampus.

1:02:30.647 --> 1:02:33.448
If you can believe in him,
why can't you believe in me?

1:02:35.384 --> 1:02:38.186
Well, you make a good point there, I suppose.
Ah!

1:02:38.188 --> 1:02:40.522
But you stole presents.
Is that in the spirit of Christmas?

1:02:40.524 --> 1:02:43.258
I did not
steal presents!

1:02:43.260 --> 1:02:45.660
They were my presents!

1:02:45.662 --> 1:02:47.662
I did see a man

1:02:47.664 --> 1:02:50.499
carry a load of presents
into the warehouse.

1:02:50.501 --> 1:02:52.868
A man. What man?
Never saw him before

1:02:52.870 --> 1:02:55.070
in my life.

1:02:55.072 --> 1:02:57.072
Sir, could you
come with me?

1:02:57.074 --> 1:03:00.442
I'm tremendously busy.
I promise I won't

1:03:00.444 --> 1:03:02.344
keep you long, but
I will give you a chance.

1:03:02.346 --> 1:03:06.748
A chance? At what?
To save Christmas.

1:03:09.118 --> 1:03:11.153
His chin's
a little broader.

1:03:11.155 --> 1:03:13.655
And you're certain
this is the man you saw

1:03:13.657 --> 1:03:16.892
deposit the gifts
in Mr. Lynch's warehouse?

1:03:16.894 --> 1:03:19.227
Oh, yes... yeah...
yes it is.

1:03:19.229 --> 1:03:21.363
George. This could be
Robert Kratchet.

1:03:21.365 --> 1:03:24.466
Recently in the employ of none
other than Alistair McGowan.

1:03:24.468 --> 1:03:27.035
So he's our man?
Let's not jump to conclusions

1:03:27.037 --> 1:03:30.238
just yet. Thank you.
Ah!

1:03:30.240 --> 1:03:32.174
Let's pay Mr. Kratchet
a visit, shall we?

1:03:32.176 --> 1:03:34.676
Right. I'll get my sock.

1:03:34.678 --> 1:03:37.145
And where are you going?

1:03:37.147 --> 1:03:39.915
It's very late. The
Constable said I could leave.

1:03:39.917 --> 1:03:43.885
Oh, please.
Look at me,

1:03:43.887 --> 1:03:46.688
I'm hale and hearty
and I can assure you:

1:03:46.690 --> 1:03:49.124
I am no danger to myself

1:03:49.126 --> 1:03:51.827
or anyone else,
I promise you that.

1:03:51.829 --> 1:03:54.062
You're quite certain?

1:03:54.064 --> 1:03:56.865
Yes, I am. Now please.

1:03:56.867 --> 1:03:59.034
I have to go.

1:03:59.036 --> 1:04:03.605
Both you and I have
important work to do tonight.

1:04:03.607 --> 1:04:06.074
Alright. Let's
go catch a thief.

1:04:06.076 --> 1:04:08.710
And a murderer.
That too.

1:04:08.712 --> 1:04:11.413
And you are
on the naughty list.

1:04:13.349 --> 1:04:15.350
I did wonder.

1:04:21.858 --> 1:04:23.859
Where are the presents?

1:04:23.861 --> 1:04:26.394
Did we have a break in?
No.

1:04:26.396 --> 1:04:29.598
Then what?
The boys.

1:04:29.600 --> 1:04:32.300
(sighing): What did they do?
No, no. It's not like that.

1:04:32.302 --> 1:04:34.436
They took the toys
and presents and marched down

1:04:34.438 --> 1:04:37.405
to the Orphanage. They said they
had enough things and wanted

1:04:37.407 --> 1:04:38.940
to give them
to the poor children.

1:04:38.942 --> 1:04:42.210
I have never been so proud.

1:04:42.212 --> 1:04:44.646
My boys are better men than me.

1:04:44.648 --> 1:04:48.116
What are you talking about, Thomas?

1:04:48.118 --> 1:04:50.719
Do you know what I did at
Christmas when I was their age?

1:04:50.721 --> 1:04:53.421
I told my father
how much I hated him.

1:04:53.423 --> 1:04:56.291
That's why Krampus
came calling.

1:04:56.293 --> 1:04:58.460
Oh, you know Krampus is not real.

1:04:58.462 --> 1:05:01.763
That's what they say.
Where are you going?

1:05:01.765 --> 1:05:05.200
To make things right.

1:05:15.011 --> 1:05:18.013
<i>It's Christmas Eve.</i>
<i>I'm well aware of that,</i>

1:05:18.015 --> 1:05:20.982
Mr. Kratchet. Please,
answer the question.

1:05:20.984 --> 1:05:24.019
I delivered the presents
to Mr. Lynch's warehouse.

1:05:24.021 --> 1:05:26.388
What of it?
They were stolen.

1:05:26.390 --> 1:05:30.859
No, they weren't. Mrs. McGowan
found them in her house.

1:05:30.861 --> 1:05:32.827
After Mr. McGowan's murder.

1:05:32.829 --> 1:05:35.096
But why deliver them
to Lynch's warehouse?

1:05:35.098 --> 1:05:37.432
She said they were to aid
Mr. Lynch's charity drive.

1:05:37.434 --> 1:05:39.834
I had no reason
to believe otherwise.

1:05:39.836 --> 1:05:42.537
Why would she do that?
I don't know.

1:05:42.539 --> 1:05:45.974
Perhaps she, unlike
her husband, had a good heart.

1:05:45.976 --> 1:05:48.043
Detective,

1:05:48.045 --> 1:05:50.946
I honestly didn't know
I was doing something wrong.

1:05:54.884 --> 1:05:57.052
Sorry to trouble you,
Mr. Kratchet

1:05:57.054 --> 1:05:59.154
Merry Christmas.

1:06:04.193 --> 1:06:06.561
Why would she help
her husband's rival?

1:06:06.563 --> 1:06:08.730
She was a
charitable soul, sir.

1:06:08.732 --> 1:06:10.699
I'd be inclined to believe
that, George, were it not

1:06:10.701 --> 1:06:12.701
for the timing.

1:06:12.703 --> 1:06:15.804
Mr. Lynch's gift drive
hadn't been announced yet.

1:06:15.806 --> 1:06:18.373
She only had Mr. Kratchet do that

1:06:18.375 --> 1:06:21.343
in order to implicate Mr. Lynch
in her husband's murder.

1:06:21.345 --> 1:06:24.446
So she did it?
You're jumping again, George.

1:06:24.448 --> 1:06:27.882
North on Yonge Street, driver.

1:06:29.819 --> 1:06:31.886
With pleasure, sir.

1:06:46.235 --> 1:06:49.671
Mrs. McGowan?
Millicent?

1:06:57.179 --> 1:07:00.448
What are we doing here?

1:07:00.450 --> 1:07:03.084
Doing what the Inspector
always says to do.

1:07:03.086 --> 1:07:05.520
Following the money.

1:07:09.425 --> 1:07:13.061
Just a few files Rankin was
disinclined to show us, sir.

1:07:15.064 --> 1:07:17.065
A-HA!

1:07:17.067 --> 1:07:19.667
What is it?
We know that Mr. McGowan

1:07:19.669 --> 1:07:22.203
and Mr. Lynch were partners
who eventually parted ways.

1:07:22.205 --> 1:07:26.141
But Mr. Rankin didn't
tell us about this.

1:07:29.979 --> 1:07:32.113
I've been chasing after you lot

1:07:32.115 --> 1:07:34.649
halfway across bloody Toronto.

1:07:34.651 --> 1:07:37.118
Nice of you to join us,
sir. We have it.

1:07:37.120 --> 1:07:39.120
They were all partners, sir.

1:07:39.122 --> 1:07:41.689
McGowan, Lynch, and Rankin.

1:07:41.691 --> 1:07:44.893
At the very beginning, yes.
Mr. Rankin was an equal partner

1:07:44.895 --> 1:07:47.429
in the very first company
that the three of them formed.

1:07:47.431 --> 1:07:49.531
But when the business
started off slowly,

1:07:49.533 --> 1:07:53.468
Mr. Rankin wanted out, so he
sold his shares in their company

1:07:53.470 --> 1:07:57.138
to them for 100 dollars.
Not a wise move.

1:07:57.140 --> 1:08:00.341
Mr. McGowan and Mr. Lynch
built it up to a million-dollar

1:08:00.343 --> 1:08:02.710
enterprise before
they parted ways.

1:08:02.712 --> 1:08:05.146
And Mr. Rankin?
The best they could offer him

1:08:05.148 --> 1:08:07.182
was a position as
a salaried employee.

1:08:07.184 --> 1:08:10.385
Enough to make a man
very, very bitter.

1:08:10.387 --> 1:08:13.154
He watched his friends getting
richer and richer every day

1:08:13.156 --> 1:08:15.924
while he continued on
as a poorly-paid bookkeeper.

1:08:15.926 --> 1:08:18.393
Is Millicent McGowan involved?
I've found no evidence

1:08:18.395 --> 1:08:21.362
to link her into any of this.
So she's innocent?

1:08:21.364 --> 1:08:24.065
Ah, that's jumping
to conclusions, Doctor.

1:08:24.067 --> 1:08:26.401
Mr. Rankin would be up

1:08:26.403 --> 1:08:28.503
to answer this question,
if we knew where to find him.

1:08:28.505 --> 1:08:31.339
Bring the sleigh around,
George. Mr. Rankin has a home

1:08:31.341 --> 1:08:33.808
just outside the city limits.
Ah, well,

1:08:33.810 --> 1:08:36.911
let's go and deliver him
some festive cheer.

1:08:36.913 --> 1:08:40.415
Sir, look out for that stump!

1:08:42.718 --> 1:08:45.887
Ooh! Ooh!

1:08:50.893 --> 1:08:52.961
Sirs! Look.

1:08:56.732 --> 1:08:58.433
They're animal
tracks, George.

1:08:58.435 --> 1:09:00.568
Sir, it's not just an animal.
I'm telling you these are

1:09:00.570 --> 1:09:04.072
the same tracks I
saw when that old tramp
saw the beast on the bridge.

1:09:04.074 --> 1:09:07.408
But you didn't see the
beast. You said so yourself.

1:09:07.410 --> 1:09:10.078
I smelled it, sir.
There was hideous smell.

1:09:10.080 --> 1:09:13.381
Fine. You stay here.
We'll handle this.

1:09:15.985 --> 1:09:18.086
Let's get a
move on, Crabtree.

1:09:18.088 --> 1:09:20.588
Sir, what if
Krampus is in there?

1:09:20.590 --> 1:09:23.691
Then we tell him
he's not welcome.

1:09:31.767 --> 1:09:33.768
Mr. Rankin!

1:09:33.770 --> 1:09:35.770
Toronto Constabulary!

1:09:35.772 --> 1:09:38.473
(whimpering nearby)
Shh! William, listen.

1:09:38.475 --> 1:09:40.742
(whimpering ongoing)

1:09:45.814 --> 1:09:48.683
(muffled screams)

1:09:48.685 --> 1:09:51.319
Are you alright?
(whimpers)

1:09:51.321 --> 1:09:53.555
Ah! Yes.

1:09:53.557 --> 1:09:55.557
yes, I think so.

1:09:55.559 --> 1:09:58.126
Julia, wait.

1:09:58.128 --> 1:10:01.129
Who did this to you?
It wasn't a who.

1:10:01.131 --> 1:10:03.164
Where's Mr. Rankin?
I have no idea.

1:10:03.166 --> 1:10:06.367
Who brought you here?
It was a monster.

1:10:06.369 --> 1:10:10.471
It had horns,
and had horrible red eyes.

1:10:10.473 --> 1:10:14.242
I have no time for fairy
tales, Mrs. McGowan. The truth.

1:10:14.244 --> 1:10:17.612
That's what I'm telling you.
No, Julia,

1:10:17.614 --> 1:10:19.948
leave her.
(Mrs. McGowan): Oh!

1:10:19.950 --> 1:10:22.150
Let's find
Mr. Rankin first.

1:10:22.152 --> 1:10:25.019
We'll split up.

1:10:26.922 --> 1:10:29.991
Beware of the beast.

1:10:34.697 --> 1:10:38.032
(blowing wind)

1:10:38.034 --> 1:10:40.635
(door slamming)

1:10:40.637 --> 1:10:43.338
(Lets air out.)

1:10:43.340 --> 1:10:46.608
Crikey.

1:10:50.312 --> 1:10:52.313
Krampus?

1:10:52.315 --> 1:10:55.483
Krampus?!

1:10:55.485 --> 1:10:57.552
(Meeeow!)
(whimpering)

1:10:59.488 --> 1:11:01.623
God!

1:11:01.625 --> 1:11:04.959
Hello?

1:11:08.030 --> 1:11:09.764
Hello!

1:11:09.766 --> 1:11:11.532
(mechanism and gasping)

1:11:11.534 --> 1:11:14.302
(Cuckoo! Cuckoo! Cuckoo!)

1:11:14.304 --> 1:11:18.072
(Clock continues to chime.)

1:11:18.074 --> 1:11:20.942
(clock ticking)

1:11:25.114 --> 1:11:28.516
(Crabtree): Sirs! Doctor!

1:11:28.518 --> 1:11:30.885
Come look at this.

1:11:30.887 --> 1:11:34.522
(unnerving escalating music)

1:11:41.363 --> 1:11:44.565
Right. We best
split up.

1:11:44.567 --> 1:11:46.668
Why?

1:11:46.670 --> 1:11:49.237
I'm sure this bugger knows this
maze like the back of his hand.

1:11:49.239 --> 1:11:51.739
If he was here,
he's probably long gone.

1:11:51.741 --> 1:11:54.676
Besides, if we split up,
he'll pick us off one by one.

1:11:54.678 --> 1:11:57.145
George, he's
an accountant.

1:11:57.147 --> 1:12:00.481
Sir, he could be Krampus!
There is no such thing

1:12:00.483 --> 1:12:03.351
as Krampus!
What are you talking about?

1:12:03.353 --> 1:12:05.186
I'll explain
later. Let's go.

1:12:34.983 --> 1:12:37.151
(growling)

1:12:37.153 --> 1:12:40.288
William! William!

1:12:40.290 --> 1:12:43.291
I think I saw something.
Is it him?

1:12:43.293 --> 1:12:45.293
I don't know.
It was something!

1:12:45.295 --> 1:12:47.962
Something?
Yes, something!

1:12:47.964 --> 1:12:51.165
What in God's name
are you saying?

1:12:51.167 --> 1:12:53.935
Doctor Ogden?!

1:13:13.222 --> 1:13:15.223
Sir?
Yes.

1:13:15.225 --> 1:13:19.026
I'm seeing more of the tracks.
I see them, too, George.

1:13:19.028 --> 1:13:22.397
Don't worry, it's just a ruse.

1:13:22.399 --> 1:13:24.465
If it is, it's a bloody good one.

1:13:30.839 --> 1:13:33.040
Doctor?

1:13:33.042 --> 1:13:35.510
Doctor?

1:13:43.752 --> 1:13:45.753
You should not
have followed me.

1:13:45.755 --> 1:13:47.955
Krampus?

1:13:49.992 --> 1:13:52.293
You know what happens now.

1:13:53.996 --> 1:13:56.097
Dinner.

1:13:56.099 --> 1:13:59.400
You're not real.

1:13:59.402 --> 1:14:02.470
You're nothing but a fairy tale.

1:14:02.472 --> 1:14:07.074
A stupid fable!
An old wives tale.

1:14:07.076 --> 1:14:09.076
Murdoch!

1:14:09.078 --> 1:14:12.046
Follow my voice. I got him!

1:14:12.048 --> 1:14:15.016
George!
Sir?

1:14:15.018 --> 1:14:17.084
Find Julia!

1:14:43.178 --> 1:14:45.947
(grunt)

1:14:45.949 --> 1:14:48.916
(whistling wind)

1:14:50.819 --> 1:14:53.588
Oh!
(sigh)

1:14:53.590 --> 1:14:55.590
I've seen the beast.

1:14:55.592 --> 1:14:57.592
Sir, there is no beast.

1:14:57.594 --> 1:14:59.794
Oh, bloody hell, Murdoch,
I know that. But as far

1:14:59.796 --> 1:15:01.796
as I'm concerned, a man
who dresses like a beast

1:15:01.798 --> 1:15:04.332
is as good as one.

1:15:04.334 --> 1:15:06.534
I suppose I can't argue with that.

1:15:06.536 --> 1:15:08.936
(sighing): Follow me.

1:15:12.808 --> 1:15:15.209
Doctor!

1:15:18.881 --> 1:15:20.882
Doctor!

1:15:20.884 --> 1:15:23.518
Julia.

1:15:25.454 --> 1:15:28.122
George.
Are you alright?

1:15:28.124 --> 1:15:30.825
Ah... I think so.

1:15:30.827 --> 1:15:33.995
Who did this to you?
I really didn't see.

1:15:33.997 --> 1:15:37.164
But they ran that way.

1:15:37.166 --> 1:15:40.434
Are you sure you're alright?
Yes, go.

1:15:40.436 --> 1:15:43.237
You stay here.

1:15:43.239 --> 1:15:45.239
Sir!

1:15:45.241 --> 1:15:48.376
Stop!

1:15:48.378 --> 1:15:50.378
Aye! Stop!

1:15:50.380 --> 1:15:53.014
Find Julia.
Be careful, Murdoch.

1:15:53.016 --> 1:15:55.783
Hello?

1:15:55.785 --> 1:15:58.319
Hello!

1:16:02.224 --> 1:16:04.892
Krampus? OH!!

1:16:15.571 --> 1:16:17.638
(grunt of effort)

1:16:22.177 --> 1:16:24.178
(groan)

1:16:24.180 --> 1:16:27.114
(liquid being poured)

1:16:30.185 --> 1:16:33.087
Millicent! Stop what you're doing!

1:16:33.089 --> 1:16:35.556
Aren't you clever.

1:16:35.558 --> 1:16:37.892
You're a murderer, Millicent.

1:16:37.894 --> 1:16:40.294
I had no choice.

1:16:40.296 --> 1:16:42.897
My husband was robbing me
blind. Giving his money away

1:16:42.899 --> 1:16:45.232
to layabouts.
There are 3 police officers

1:16:45.234 --> 1:16:47.268
here. You'll never
get away with it.

1:16:47.270 --> 1:16:50.972
Oh, I think I will.
Unless you can walk through fire.

1:16:50.974 --> 1:16:53.908
Don't!

1:16:53.910 --> 1:16:57.445
(scratching and sighing)

1:16:57.447 --> 1:16:59.447
Pity they don't seem to be working.

1:16:59.449 --> 1:17:02.850
Poor little match girl.

1:17:02.852 --> 1:17:05.219
(grunting and groaning)

1:17:05.221 --> 1:17:07.722
(fighting sounds)

1:17:22.304 --> 1:17:24.405
Ya!
OH!

1:17:26.141 --> 1:17:29.143
Do you need a hand, Doctor?

1:17:29.145 --> 1:17:31.112
I think I have it covered.

1:17:31.114 --> 1:17:33.214
(hit, yelp and groan)

1:17:33.216 --> 1:17:36.017
Always enjoyed a good
Christmas punch.

1:17:36.019 --> 1:17:40.021
So do I, Inspector. So do I.

1:17:46.628 --> 1:17:48.562
Stop!
Huh!

1:17:54.903 --> 1:17:56.837
(grunts and groans)

1:18:01.943 --> 1:18:04.412
(fighting sounds)

1:18:44.653 --> 1:18:48.222
Let go or I'll kill you.
I very much doubt that.

1:18:53.328 --> 1:18:55.963
Mr. Rankin said that
my husband was going broke.

1:18:55.965 --> 1:18:58.032
That he was going
to put me in poverty.

1:18:58.034 --> 1:19:01.001
You hardly look poor.
Giving away what's

1:19:01.003 --> 1:19:03.738
rightfully mine to the
undeserving! I'd had enough!

1:19:03.740 --> 1:19:06.841
Your husband was a cheat
and thief. But he had plenty

1:19:06.843 --> 1:19:08.909
of money to live on and
plenty for you. I saw his books.

1:19:08.911 --> 1:19:10.878
That's not what
Mr. Rankin said.

1:19:10.880 --> 1:19:13.114
He played you like
an old piano, ma'am.

1:19:13.116 --> 1:19:15.316
And made you an accessory
to two murders.

1:19:15.318 --> 1:19:17.885
I had nothing to do
with Mr. Lynch's murder.

1:19:17.887 --> 1:19:20.121
I swear.
Well then,

1:19:20.123 --> 1:19:22.890
we'll have to settle for your
part in killing your husband.

1:19:22.892 --> 1:19:24.525
You've caused
enough trouble, Mr. Rankin.

1:19:24.527 --> 1:19:26.861
I don't suppose
you want to hear my side.

1:19:26.863 --> 1:19:28.262
Not particularly. No.
You lied!

1:19:28.264 --> 1:19:32.233
Mrs. McGowan!
Get her off me.

1:19:32.235 --> 1:19:34.668
You told me he was broke!

1:19:34.670 --> 1:19:37.138
I lied.
You lied!?

1:19:37.140 --> 1:19:39.340
I helped you kill my husband!

1:19:39.342 --> 1:19:41.375
You wouldn't have done it
if you didn't want to.

1:19:41.377 --> 1:19:44.578
You were just going to leave
me there, weren't you? You were

1:19:44.580 --> 1:19:47.248
never coming back for me.
Why would I?

1:19:47.250 --> 1:19:51.018
You were as bad as he was.
As all of them were.

1:19:51.020 --> 1:19:54.421
She's worse than I am.
Oh, I doubt that. You tried

1:19:54.423 --> 1:19:57.458
to terrorize an entire city.
A city overrun

1:19:57.460 --> 1:19:59.627
with greed
and false cheer.

1:19:59.629 --> 1:20:02.563
It deserved it.
You all deserve it.

1:20:02.565 --> 1:20:04.965
And you wallow
in vice and depravity

1:20:04.967 --> 1:20:08.769
and cruelty to your fellow man.
And dress yourselves up all

1:20:08.771 --> 1:20:12.039
in false piety and reward
yourselves on Christmas Day.

1:20:12.041 --> 1:20:15.376
(snickering): I am Krampus

1:20:15.378 --> 1:20:17.645
and I hate all those
who celebrate Christmas.

1:20:17.647 --> 1:20:20.147
I hate what it stands for.

1:20:20.149 --> 1:20:23.083
It's a holiday for hypocrites

1:20:23.085 --> 1:20:25.186
where the Godless can pretend to be pious,

1:20:25.188 --> 1:20:28.722
the greedy can pretend to be generous.

1:20:28.724 --> 1:20:30.858
People like me, we end up with nothing.

1:20:30.860 --> 1:20:33.160
You throw crumbs at our feet and
we're supposed to be grateful.

1:20:33.162 --> 1:20:35.796
I hate it!

1:20:35.798 --> 1:20:38.032
You know what?

1:20:40.135 --> 1:20:42.937
I feel sorry for you.
And why's that?

1:20:42.939 --> 1:20:44.839
You'd feel better if you
measured Christmas by what

1:20:44.841 --> 1:20:47.508
you can give...
not what you can get.

1:20:47.510 --> 1:20:51.178
At least you'll have a warm
Christmas Eve in the cells.

1:20:51.180 --> 1:20:54.481
Be grateful for that.

1:21:00.322 --> 1:21:02.389
(bells chiming)

1:21:14.202 --> 1:21:17.137
(breathing and cooing)

1:21:17.139 --> 1:21:19.773
Merry Christmas, Doctor.

1:21:19.775 --> 1:21:22.443
(with a soft laugh):
Merry Christmas, Detective.

1:21:25.013 --> 1:21:28.182
I imagine George will
be waiting by the tree.

1:21:28.184 --> 1:21:30.451
(chuckles)

1:21:36.791 --> 1:21:39.526
George?
Where's is he?

1:21:39.528 --> 1:21:41.929
I have no idea.

1:21:47.602 --> 1:21:50.838
<i>"Thank you for Christmas Eve.</i>
<i>Enjoy your morning.</i>

1:21:50.840 --> 1:21:53.374
<i>Much appreciation.</i>
<i>George Crabtree."</i>

1:21:53.376 --> 1:21:56.010
Oranges.

1:21:56.012 --> 1:21:58.545
Oh, lovely!

1:21:58.547 --> 1:22:00.714
What is this?

1:22:00.716 --> 1:22:04.018
(snickering): A rib spreader!

1:22:04.020 --> 1:22:06.220
Yours was getting
old and rusty.

1:22:06.222 --> 1:22:08.989
Overuse, I imagine. Thank you.

1:22:10.759 --> 1:22:13.494
And I had this made especially for you.

1:22:21.569 --> 1:22:23.904
My hat?
For the tree!

1:22:23.906 --> 1:22:26.907
Oh! Thank you.

1:22:26.909 --> 1:22:29.710
Shall we go
to the hospital?

1:22:29.712 --> 1:22:31.979
In a moment.

1:22:34.316 --> 1:22:37.918
Oh, you don't need that.

1:22:37.920 --> 1:22:40.921
(giggles)

1:22:40.923 --> 1:22:43.490
We should go.

1:22:45.727 --> 1:22:48.963
(laughing and shouting)

1:22:48.965 --> 1:22:51.598
(Choo-choo!)

1:22:53.668 --> 1:22:57.338
How did you find a toy store
open so late on Christmas Eve?

1:22:57.340 --> 1:22:59.773
It wasn't exactly open.
Wh...?

1:22:59.775 --> 1:23:02.576
I broke in. I did leave
enough to cover the cost.

1:23:02.578 --> 1:23:05.479
I'm gonna nip out for a bit.

1:23:05.481 --> 1:23:08.215
Oh, I highly doubt
the pubs are open today.

1:23:08.217 --> 1:23:11.285
I'm not going to the pub. The
boys are on a bit of a mission

1:23:11.287 --> 1:23:13.287
this morning;
I thought I'd pitch in.

1:23:13.289 --> 1:23:15.689
I'll see you at lunchtime.

1:23:17.425 --> 1:23:20.494
They're called incubators.

1:23:20.496 --> 1:23:23.364
They will deliver
a safe, regulated heat.

1:23:23.366 --> 1:23:26.834
My husband assures me they'll
work and save many lives.

1:23:26.836 --> 1:23:29.503
Thank you.
Thank Miss Pickford.

1:23:29.505 --> 1:23:32.339
She is your champion.
Anyone who helps us

1:23:32.341 --> 1:23:35.943
with our work is a champion.
Thank you, Detective Murdoch

1:23:35.945 --> 1:23:38.679
and Doctor Ogden.
Merry Christmas.

1:23:38.681 --> 1:23:40.647
(soft laugh)

1:23:40.649 --> 1:23:43.117
Merry Christmas. There ya go.

1:23:43.119 --> 1:23:45.319
Merry Christmas.

1:23:45.321 --> 1:23:47.488
Lads!

1:23:47.490 --> 1:23:50.457
Ah, Sir! I thought you'd be
home with your family.

1:23:50.459 --> 1:23:52.860
I'll have plenty of time
for my family later today.

1:23:52.862 --> 1:23:55.329
Where's Higgins?
The lure of Elsie McVie

1:23:55.331 --> 1:23:57.331
was too much.
Ha ha!

1:23:57.333 --> 1:23:59.500
Can't blame the lad for trying.
(chuckles)

1:23:59.502 --> 1:24:01.335
Thank you for coming,
Inspector. You know,

1:24:01.337 --> 1:24:03.303
Christmas time is a special
time when we can all...

1:24:03.305 --> 1:24:05.639
Jackson, enough. I'm here, aren't I?

1:24:05.641 --> 1:24:09.043
Indeed you are, Inspector.
Oh, who wants this big one?

1:24:11.179 --> 1:24:13.881
It really is a special time, isn't it?

1:24:13.883 --> 1:24:16.984
Charitable donations,
doing something good.

1:24:16.986 --> 1:24:20.821
It's as though you can truly feel

1:24:20.823 --> 1:24:23.357
the magic of...

1:24:23.359 --> 1:24:25.959
Where did that came from?

1:24:25.961 --> 1:24:27.895
Oh, I think I have an idea.

1:24:27.897 --> 1:24:31.999
Do you now, Great Detective?

1:24:32.001 --> 1:24:34.768
(chuckles)

1:24:34.770 --> 1:24:36.837
Oh, and I think
she needs arresting.

1:24:36.839 --> 1:24:39.306
No! William.

1:24:39.308 --> 1:24:41.708
(giggling)

1:24:49.184 --> 1:24:52.219
We're running low.
I can see that.

1:24:52.221 --> 1:24:54.488
Looks like the mighty
Higgins struck out.

1:24:58.760 --> 1:25:02.129
Higgins! Best of the season.

1:25:02.131 --> 1:25:05.199
And to you, George.
So Elsie McVie...

1:25:05.201 --> 1:25:07.267
Spoken for
already, apparently.

1:25:07.269 --> 1:25:09.903
That's a shame, Henry.
It's okay,

1:25:09.905 --> 1:25:12.072
The camera provided
a more flattering picture

1:25:12.074 --> 1:25:14.274
than the reality.
Ha ha ha! Well, come join us.

1:25:14.276 --> 1:25:16.610
I will! But first,

1:25:16.612 --> 1:25:19.746
there's someone I'd like you to meet.
(gasp)

1:25:19.748 --> 1:25:23.150
Surprise. Merry
Christmas, Georgie!

1:25:23.152 --> 1:25:26.220
Aunt Azalia! Aunt Ivy!

1:25:26.222 --> 1:25:27.921
I thought...
We pulled a fast one on you!

1:25:27.923 --> 1:25:30.691
Merry Christmas, Georgie.
Sir!

1:25:30.693 --> 1:25:33.260
My aunts! They came!
Yes, I see that!

1:25:33.262 --> 1:25:35.395
Hello, ladies!

1:25:35.397 --> 1:25:37.498
It appears we've
arrived too late.

1:25:37.500 --> 1:25:39.500
Uh, yes sir, uh...

1:25:39.502 --> 1:25:41.502
more children than
presents, I'm afraid.

1:25:41.504 --> 1:25:43.504
What about those?

1:25:45.707 --> 1:25:47.774
Good gracious. Where
did those come from?

1:25:47.776 --> 1:25:51.745
Does it matter?

1:25:51.747 --> 1:25:55.115
Ooh! Christmas truly is here.

1:25:55.117 --> 1:25:57.985
Aunt Azalia!

1:25:57.987 --> 1:26:00.888
Alright, who doesn't
have a present yet?

1:26:02.824 --> 1:26:05.692
Here's a lovely one for you.
There you go!

1:26:07.428 --> 1:26:10.464
Thank you,
thank you for you.

1:26:10.466 --> 1:26:12.733
And to you:
Merry Christmas!

1:26:16.337 --> 1:26:19.106
Did you see that?

1:26:19.108 --> 1:26:21.208
See what?

1:26:21.210 --> 1:26:23.777
You saw him.
I know you did.

1:26:23.779 --> 1:26:27.381
Merry Christmas!
