WEBVTT

01:10.153 --> 01:11.530
You good. Aight.

01:13.115 --> 01:16.201
Yo, your pops rented us the bus
and everything?

01:16.952 --> 01:19.580
I don't know.
Maybe he made a donation or something.

01:22.875 --> 01:24.418
-Morning, Meg.
-Morning.

01:30.299 --> 01:33.010
Okay, Mom. See you later.

01:33.093 --> 01:35.179
Be safe. Love you.

01:36.054 --> 01:37.222
I love you too.

01:38.599 --> 01:40.058
You forgetting somethin'?

01:41.560 --> 01:42.561
Oops.

01:43.812 --> 01:44.730
Have a good game.

01:55.282 --> 01:56.325
Good morning, Coach.

01:58.327 --> 02:00.579
-Got them rapid test results?
-Yeah.

02:03.832 --> 02:04.833
Hop on.

02:05.501 --> 02:06.585
All right.

02:07.503 --> 02:09.169
Hello, sir. I'm Jace.

02:09.252 --> 02:10.923
Good morning, young man. I'm Mr. Wright.

02:11.006 --> 02:13.759
Right as in not wrong,
or right as in not left?

02:13.842 --> 02:17.846
Wright as in W-R-I-G-H-T.

02:18.805 --> 02:20.140
Got it, sir.

02:20.224 --> 02:21.975
What's up, Jace? How you feelin'?

02:22.059 --> 02:24.645
Excited to hoop again. Tired.

02:24.728 --> 02:26.480
All right. We got a long drive. Rest up.

02:26.563 --> 02:27.564
Okay.

02:28.649 --> 02:30.067
-Hey, Coach.
-Hey, Nick.

02:30.150 --> 02:32.402
We're at capacity
as far as social distancing.

02:32.945 --> 02:35.614
Jump in with Meg.
It's probably more comfortable anyway.

02:35.697 --> 02:36.865
All right. No problem.

03:33.338 --> 04:12.169
We are what America looks like!

04:14.463 --> 04:17.132
-What you got, man?
-Shit.

04:17.216 --> 04:18.966
Line 25

04:19.801 --> 04:22.387
I play so much 2K
I'm ready to hoop again

04:22.471 --> 04:24.723
Dish the rock off to Drew
He ready to shoot again

04:24.806 --> 04:26.642
His headband been retired for too long

04:26.725 --> 04:28.894
He been in Zoom with his camera off
Getting answers wrong

04:28.977 --> 04:30.437
All right, listen.

04:30.521 --> 04:32.147
Hope you boys ready to play, yo
Jace, bro

04:32.231 --> 04:34.066
'Bout to smash this other team
Like Play-Doh

04:34.149 --> 04:36.652
Hope he gets to dunk the rock
From the free throw line

04:36.735 --> 04:38.737
Hey, even lay it up
I know it's been some time

04:39.905 --> 04:41.156
Yeah, it's been some time

04:41.240 --> 04:43.367
We used to be the Grind
Now we still on the grind

04:43.450 --> 04:45.786
-Okay.
-Hey, got Swagger on my mind

04:45.869 --> 04:48.288
Got 20/20 vision
So we can never be blind

04:48.372 --> 04:50.499
And you know I never lack, yeah

04:50.582 --> 04:52.918
Hey, when I'm back
And I'm runnin' up, attack, y'all

04:53.001 --> 04:55.170
Hop up on the beat
I can never be wack, y'all

04:55.254 --> 04:57.339
Back where I'm from
They call me ninth-grade shot

04:57.422 --> 04:59.424
And I get it right back--

05:01.635 --> 05:03.470
What are you talking about?

05:03.554 --> 05:06.014
Man, I was so excited
to start high school.

05:06.098 --> 05:08.475
Now everything's online.
How am I supposed to meet girls?

05:09.560 --> 05:10.811
My school's in person.

05:10.894 --> 05:13.146
But we gotta wear masks
and social distance,

05:13.230 --> 05:16.400
so I don't think that's the best thing
for a brother's love life.

05:17.568 --> 05:18.694
What about you, Nick?

05:18.777 --> 05:20.737
Basketball's my girlfriend.

05:20.821 --> 05:23.031
Bro, you realize how creepy that sounds?

05:23.615 --> 05:26.243
Hey, even though
we're going up against your old squad,

05:26.326 --> 05:28.245
I want you to treat this
like any other game.

05:29.079 --> 05:30.080
I will.

05:30.873 --> 05:32.916
Hey, they're gonna livestream this, right?

05:33.000 --> 05:35.294
-Right.
-You know my fam in PR is gonna watch?

05:35.377 --> 05:37.754
Gladiator is gonna use this
as one big commercial

05:37.838 --> 05:39.673
for them and the Dominion Ballers.

05:39.756 --> 05:42.134
So how about we burst their bubble?

05:42.217 --> 05:44.970
Wait, but you just said
to treat it like any other game.

05:45.596 --> 05:47.306
Yeah. That too.

05:52.561 --> 05:53.812
Hey, yo, bro--

05:54.771 --> 05:55.814
You gotta relax.

05:55.898 --> 05:58.233
You need some hand sanitizer.

05:58.317 --> 05:59.693
Relax, man.

05:59.776 --> 06:02.821
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo! Keep it down.

06:04.656 --> 06:06.992
You know, months ago
you yelled at them like a coach.

06:07.075 --> 06:08.202
Now you sound like a dad.

06:09.119 --> 06:12.247
That reminds me.
I ain't show you how big she gettin'.

06:15.334 --> 06:16.919
Look at the baby.

06:17.002 --> 06:18.086
Yeah.

06:18.170 --> 06:20.839
She don't look much bigger
than the pictures you sent me yesterday.

06:25.093 --> 06:26.428
Hey, how you doin'?

06:26.512 --> 06:28.597
Fine. You there yet?

06:30.349 --> 06:31.517
Not even close.

06:32.476 --> 06:34.102
I gotta tell you something.

06:34.186 --> 06:35.646
What's up?

06:35.729 --> 06:37.523
Know my teammate Michelle?

06:37.606 --> 06:38.607
Yeah.

06:39.274 --> 06:41.818
She and some lady
who played for Coach back in the day

06:41.902 --> 06:43.445
are testifying against him.

06:44.196 --> 06:46.323
They're gonna tell all the things
he did to them.

06:47.241 --> 06:50.911
I thought I'd be good with that,
but… I'm not.

06:52.246 --> 06:53.413
What are you saying?

06:54.039 --> 06:55.666
I need to testify too.

06:58.710 --> 07:00.796
You said
you never want to talk about it again.

07:00.879 --> 07:04.633
And I don't. But… I have to.

07:06.134 --> 07:07.970
-I'm gonna tell my mom.
-When?

07:08.053 --> 07:10.389
Today. After church.

07:13.559 --> 07:14.726
That's good.

07:15.477 --> 07:16.728
It's the right thing to do.

07:17.813 --> 07:18.814
Think so?

07:19.481 --> 07:20.482
Yeah.

07:23.068 --> 07:24.361
What if I testify…

07:26.363 --> 07:28.532
and they ask me what I know
about the attack?

07:29.283 --> 07:32.786
I mean, do you know anything about it?

07:34.705 --> 07:35.747
'Cause I don't.

07:42.212 --> 07:44.006
Nah, I don't.

07:49.595 --> 07:50.637
All right. Ball out.

07:52.389 --> 07:53.390
Always.

08:21.752 --> 08:22.961
Get off the bus.

08:26.131 --> 08:27.466
-Yo, I'll be right in.
-Okay.

08:35.474 --> 08:38.101
-Here's a whole… group.
-Hey, what you doing up so early?

08:38.683 --> 08:40.270
It's like 6:15 out in Cali.

08:40.354 --> 08:43.440
Yeah, I know. I know.
It just feels like I should be there.

08:43.524 --> 08:44.608
You should.

08:44.691 --> 08:46.818
Well, Grandma needs us.

08:46.902 --> 08:49.196
Yeah. If I didn't have to work,
I'd be there too.

08:49.905 --> 08:52.783
Your mom's telling me you don't wanna talk
to that therapist she found.

08:53.534 --> 08:56.995
Look, just 'cause I'm nervous about
the whole pandemic doesn't mean I'm crazy.

08:57.079 --> 09:00.207
No. No. No, son.
Getting therapy doesn't mean you're crazy.

09:00.290 --> 09:01.500
We're just concerned.

09:01.583 --> 09:04.837
Feels like you're troubled, and it doesn't
feel like you know how to talk about it.

09:04.920 --> 09:06.004
I'm not.

09:06.088 --> 09:07.673
I'm not, all right? I promise.

09:08.465 --> 09:09.758
You know, I'm--

09:11.009 --> 09:13.428
I'm just gonna go back to sleep now.
All right?

09:13.512 --> 09:16.306
Okay. Aight. You gonna watch later?

09:16.390 --> 09:17.516
Yeah, of course.

09:18.725 --> 09:20.644
-All right. I love you.
-I love you.

09:23.146 --> 09:25.774
-Hey, make sure you say your prayers.
-All right.

09:25.858 --> 09:27.025
All right.

09:28.151 --> 09:30.988
Can I get the whole group
on one bill, please?

09:31.071 --> 09:33.031
-Yeah. Okay.
-Huh?

09:34.157 --> 09:36.743
Oh, yeah. It's me, Jace Carson.

09:38.328 --> 09:40.873
Sorry, miss,
I really can't take no selfies right now.

09:40.956 --> 09:44.585
Take one with you and before you know it,
it's a huge crowd.

09:47.004 --> 09:48.255
Okay.

09:48.338 --> 09:49.673
I guess we can get one.

09:51.425 --> 09:54.011
You know, my parents
still don't know how good we are.

09:54.094 --> 09:55.345
They watching online?

09:55.429 --> 09:57.097
Well, said they would.

09:57.723 --> 09:59.266
Either way, I'm gonna handle mine.

10:00.767 --> 10:04.771
Man, after today,
everyone's gonna know how good we hoop.

10:05.522 --> 10:07.274
You know that because…

10:07.357 --> 10:08.692
Premonition.

10:09.484 --> 10:11.653
Think your old teammates
are gonna try to end you?

10:11.737 --> 10:14.740
Probably. I know they added some bigs.

10:14.823 --> 10:15.991
You're not nervous?

10:16.658 --> 10:18.035
Not as nervous as they should be.

10:18.619 --> 10:20.871
Man, I'm nervous.
All those people watching.

10:20.954 --> 10:23.248
Hey. If you don't want to screw up,

10:23.999 --> 10:25.792
then just stop worrying about screwing up.

10:25.876 --> 10:28.212
-All right?
-All right.

10:28.295 --> 10:29.338
Can I help you?

10:29.421 --> 10:31.340
Can I get three orders
of hash browns, please?

10:31.423 --> 10:34.426
Trips I took with my team
were some of the best days of my life.

10:35.594 --> 10:37.638
I hope they don't take it all for granted.

10:38.680 --> 10:40.516
You mean like we all did back in the day?

10:43.685 --> 10:44.686
Nah.

10:44.770 --> 10:48.649
With everything that's going down,
they probably get it more than we did.

10:53.028 --> 10:54.154
Big man.

10:55.155 --> 10:57.241
What's the matter?
This place not good enough for you?

10:59.034 --> 11:00.494
Four-star only, Coach.

11:00.577 --> 11:02.287
You know, McDonald's, Burger King.

11:03.121 --> 11:04.748
Nah, but I'm still full
from that breakfast

11:04.831 --> 11:07.042
that you and Miss Tonya made this morning.

11:08.085 --> 11:09.461
She and I have been talking

11:10.379 --> 11:12.714
about switching our couch with a pullout.

11:12.798 --> 11:14.258
Be more comfortable for you.

11:14.341 --> 11:15.926
That's not necessary, Coach.

11:16.009 --> 11:17.845
I'm sure once my mom gets out of jail

11:17.928 --> 11:21.431
that my living situation should go
back to normal.

11:23.600 --> 11:26.228
Oh, you think we doing that
thinking about you?

11:27.229 --> 11:28.230
No, no, no.

11:28.313 --> 11:33.110
See, I don't want
your big ass messin' up our furniture.

11:35.821 --> 11:37.364
Yeah, okay, Coach.

11:37.447 --> 11:40.367
-I'm serious.
-Aight, okay.

11:41.952 --> 11:43.203
I'm just--

11:43.287 --> 11:45.622
Listen, I'm trying to understand
something. Like…

11:45.706 --> 11:47.457
-We have no masks for basketball.
-Right.

11:47.541 --> 11:49.543
-We have no masks for eating.
-Uh-huh.

11:49.626 --> 11:51.211
Does any of that make sense to you?

11:51.295 --> 11:54.298
No, none of it. None of it's making sense.

11:54.381 --> 11:57.384
I got a newborn at the house.
Tonya already told me I can't come home.

11:57.467 --> 11:59.261
She been burning my clothes.

12:02.347 --> 12:04.683
Straight khaki,
just iron them in the morning.

12:04.766 --> 12:07.519
They good as hell. They good as hell.

12:08.437 --> 12:09.855
Yeah, all those players.

12:11.940 --> 12:15.235
Dang, the syrup's stuck to my knife.

12:22.910 --> 12:24.995
I know you gonna shoot the lights out.

12:25.078 --> 12:27.456
Just sayin', bro. You're crazy.

12:36.548 --> 12:37.966
Is something wrong, officers?

12:38.550 --> 12:40.135
We got called about a disturbance.

12:42.596 --> 12:45.307
We're not disturbing anybody.
We're just eating our food.

12:46.266 --> 12:48.227
And some of the patrons complained.

12:50.521 --> 12:51.939
Are you here for that protest?

12:52.981 --> 12:56.193
We're just a basketball team
on the way to our game.

12:58.654 --> 13:01.073
It'd be a good idea
if you all got yourselves goin'.

13:02.491 --> 13:05.410
-Excuse me, Officer?
-Meg.

13:05.494 --> 13:08.247
No, I want to know
if he's asking us to leave or telling us.

13:08.330 --> 13:10.332
-Just so we're clear.
-I'm telling you.

13:10.415 --> 13:12.167
It'd be a good idea
if y'all just cleared out.

13:13.460 --> 13:16.964
It's a free country.
I ain't goin' nowhere till I eat my food.

13:17.047 --> 13:18.048
Facts.

13:18.966 --> 13:20.259
And one!

13:20.342 --> 13:22.010
-Whoa, whoa, whoa. Calm down.
-Wait, wait, wait.

13:22.094 --> 13:25.556
All right? Just please calm down.
There's no problem here.

13:25.639 --> 13:27.766
Excuse me, deputies,
these boys aren't hurting anyone.

13:27.850 --> 13:29.726
Please step back, ma'am. Appreciate it.

13:29.810 --> 13:32.145
Everybody, hands on the table
and stand up now.

13:32.229 --> 13:33.605
-For what?
-This is bullshit!

13:33.689 --> 13:35.274
Hey! Shut the hell up.

13:37.818 --> 13:40.988
There's no problem. We're complying.

13:41.738 --> 13:44.074
Slowly, I need to see
your hands on the table.

13:44.157 --> 13:46.076
It's gonna be all right.
Just stand up. Come on.

13:51.540 --> 13:54.042
Anybody have any outstanding warrants?

13:54.710 --> 13:56.962
No, I don't have any damn warrants.

13:57.838 --> 13:58.964
No.

14:00.424 --> 14:01.508
No warrants.

14:03.010 --> 14:04.887
We're gonna need to see your IDs.

14:05.429 --> 14:08.807
Okay.
I gotta reach in my pocket to get it.

14:32.372 --> 14:35.167
Can I get a warrant check
on an Isaac Kennedy Edwards

14:35.751 --> 14:38.170
and Naim Malik Rahaim?

14:38.253 --> 14:40.005
Roger that. Standby.

14:40.589 --> 14:42.841
What kind of work do you do?

14:42.925 --> 14:47.346
I work at--
I work at Independence Tool and Repair.

14:48.222 --> 14:49.306
And you?

14:51.934 --> 14:53.477
Contractor.

15:16.250 --> 15:18.210
That is valid. No warrants.

15:19.419 --> 15:20.462
They're clean.

15:28.971 --> 15:30.347
Okay.

15:31.056 --> 15:32.558
You can all leave.

15:36.603 --> 15:39.356
No. We're still eating.

15:39.439 --> 15:41.191
Get your stuff, and let's go.

15:41.275 --> 15:42.526
-But, Coach--
-Jace!

15:43.610 --> 15:45.153
You heard me. Let's go.

15:58.709 --> 15:59.960
Can't breathe in here anyway.

16:55.349 --> 16:57.184
All right, you're up, young lady.

17:02.606 --> 17:03.607
You're good.

17:04.650 --> 17:07.236
Next. How you doing?

17:13.450 --> 17:15.367
-Hey, y'all.
-Look who showed up.

17:15.452 --> 17:16.578
Bring it in.

17:17.246 --> 17:19.039
I wanna talk to y'all.

17:30.759 --> 17:32.511
I'm sorry for what happened back there.

17:33.178 --> 17:35.764
The whole situation sucked. I know.

17:35.848 --> 17:38.433
But it's our job to keep you guys safe.

17:39.184 --> 17:40.435
Y'all are safe.

17:42.312 --> 17:44.648
Now, let's get warmed up.

17:45.649 --> 17:47.943
Let's-- Let's get our heads right.

17:48.026 --> 17:50.821
"Get our heads right"? Are you serious?

17:52.614 --> 17:55.075
Yeah, get your head right.
You got a game today.

17:55.784 --> 17:57.578
-That was a punk move.
-What you say?

17:57.661 --> 18:00.330
That white lady stood up in the restaurant
more than you did.

18:00.414 --> 18:02.541
And what would you want me to do?
Brawl with them?

18:02.624 --> 18:04.668
We should have told them to go to hell,
Coach.

18:04.751 --> 18:05.961
That we weren't scared.

18:06.044 --> 18:08.005
I was scared.

18:10.174 --> 18:11.675
We should've called the cops on 'em.

18:11.758 --> 18:14.386
-Call the cops on the cops?
-Are you serious?

18:14.469 --> 18:16.763
I'm just saying. They ain't have no right.

18:16.847 --> 18:18.307
Y'all finished?

18:18.390 --> 18:23.145
'Cause I'd rather have y'all pissed at me
than to see you in jail or worse.

18:23.228 --> 18:24.313
That's real.

18:25.355 --> 18:28.025
I have their badge numbers.
We'll make a complaint.

18:29.109 --> 18:30.485
Folks in that gym,

18:30.569 --> 18:33.405
they don't give a damn
about what happened to us in that place.

18:33.488 --> 18:36.950
The country is tired of hearing this shit.
They are.

18:37.492 --> 18:39.870
And in a few days,
them cops won't remember.

18:39.953 --> 18:43.790
But y'all will remember this
for the rest of y'all lives.

18:43.874 --> 18:48.545
What I want you to know is that
today they tried to stop you.

18:49.046 --> 18:52.299
You came out and played your best ball.

18:55.219 --> 18:56.303
Let's go, y'all.

19:02.935 --> 19:03.936
Jace.

19:16.823 --> 19:20.452
Your job is to pull everyone together
and lead your team.

19:20.536 --> 19:23.372
I tried to lead in that restaurant,
and you blocked.

19:23.455 --> 19:26.375
We could have done like the '60s and
had one of those sit-outs or something.

19:27.626 --> 19:29.044
You mean sit-ins.

19:30.712 --> 19:31.880
Yeah, that.

19:32.381 --> 19:34.007
All right, a reality check.

19:34.758 --> 19:37.052
If y'all were ten white boys,
no one calls the cops.

19:37.135 --> 19:39.096
-That's a news flash?
-This is.

19:39.930 --> 19:41.890
Maybe I wanted to cuss them the hell out.

19:41.974 --> 19:44.268
Tell 'em you're gonna have
the type of success in life

19:44.351 --> 19:46.520
the rest of us could only dream of.

19:47.646 --> 19:48.647
I wanted to tell 'em

19:48.730 --> 19:51.859
if they had you and your teammates
as their teenage sons,

19:51.942 --> 19:53.068
they'd be fortunate.

19:55.070 --> 19:57.948
But if people can't hear you,
you can't change them.

19:58.031 --> 20:00.909
-They weren't trying to hear us.
-Scream loud enough and they'll hear us!

20:00.993 --> 20:04.204
Scream loud enough
and they'll hear 6'4" and Black.

20:05.873 --> 20:07.207
I had to get you out.

20:08.125 --> 20:10.669
If that make me a coward in your eyes,
I won't lose sleep.

20:11.879 --> 20:13.589
We got a basketball game.

20:13.672 --> 20:15.507
And none of your teammates are hurt.

20:17.384 --> 20:18.677
Pull them together, Jace.

21:11.813 --> 21:13.649
Dad. What--

21:14.733 --> 21:16.026
What are you doing here?

21:16.109 --> 21:18.695
Well, you said I never came
to any of your games.

21:18.779 --> 21:19.863
I'm here now.

21:22.658 --> 21:24.034
Well, thanks.

21:26.995 --> 21:28.580
-I gotta--
-Yeah, you go ahead.

21:28.664 --> 21:29.915
Do your thing.

22:11.957 --> 22:13.834
Welcome, everyone,

22:13.917 --> 22:20.132
to our next spotlight game
of the Soldier's Basketball Shoot-out.

22:20.215 --> 22:23.677
Brought to you by Gladiator Sneakers.

22:23.760 --> 22:25.345
Let's give them a round of applause.

22:26.597 --> 22:27.764
Thank you.

22:29.141 --> 22:33.395
This event,
sponsored by Gladiator Sneakers this year,

22:33.478 --> 22:35.272
honors our soldiers,

22:36.273 --> 22:38.317
past and present,

22:38.400 --> 22:40.152
North and South.

22:40.235 --> 22:42.070
Real-life gladiators.

22:43.238 --> 22:47.034
And now, to sing your national anthem,

22:47.117 --> 22:51.663
please welcome 14-year-old
Marianne LeFlore.

23:06.887 --> 23:13.685
O say can you see

23:15.062 --> 23:21.902
By the dawn's early light

23:24.154 --> 23:29.952
What so proudly we hailed

23:30.702 --> 23:37.501
At the twilight's last gleaming

23:38.544 --> 23:44.383
Whose broad stripes and bright stars

23:44.466 --> 23:46.009
Ah, shit.

23:47.135 --> 23:49.513
-Through the perilous fight
-What the hell are you doing?

23:49.596 --> 23:50.597
That's so played out.

23:51.265 --> 23:55.978
What happened to us at that restaurant
is more than played out.

23:56.061 --> 24:00.774
O'er the ramparts we watched

24:00.858 --> 24:03.360
You tell me what the hell
that shit got to do with this.

24:03.443 --> 24:06.989
Were so gallantly streaming?

24:07.072 --> 24:08.365
We need to be heard.

24:10.450 --> 24:17.291
And the rocket's red glare

24:18.417 --> 24:25.174
The bombs bursting in air

24:27.217 --> 24:33.307
Gave proof through the night

24:33.390 --> 24:39.980
That our flag was still there

24:40.564 --> 24:46.945
O say does that star-spangled

24:47.029 --> 24:52.242
Banner yet wave

24:54.453 --> 25:00.876
O'er the land of the free

25:01.835 --> 25:05.756
And the home

25:05.839 --> 25:11.136
Of the brave?

25:11.720 --> 25:13.430
You should be ashamed!

25:13.514 --> 25:15.307
-Such a disgrace!
-Let's go.

25:15.390 --> 25:16.934
Let's go. Let's go.

25:17.017 --> 25:18.977
Don't worry about it, let's go.
Let's go. Let's go.

25:19.061 --> 25:20.229
Disrespectful!

25:20.312 --> 25:22.022
Go on, get out of here!

25:25.984 --> 25:27.653
Where's your respect?

25:28.737 --> 25:29.863
Come on.

25:29.947 --> 25:31.782
Get on out of here! Go home!

25:32.282 --> 25:35.577
Yo, let's go. All right.

25:35.661 --> 25:38.539
Stay together. Let's play our game.

25:38.622 --> 25:41.166
All right, let's go. Let's go.

25:41.250 --> 25:43.377
-Criminals!
-Bring it in.

25:43.460 --> 25:45.462
Swagger on three.
One, two, three…

25:45.546 --> 25:46.797
Swagger!

25:52.469 --> 25:54.972
-Oh, yeah! Let's go! Come on.
-Come on, boy.

25:55.722 --> 25:56.723
Technical foul.

25:58.642 --> 26:00.435
-What? Are you serious?
-For what?

26:00.519 --> 26:01.812
Hanging on the rim.

26:02.437 --> 26:04.606
Yo. You're not gonna say anything?

26:04.690 --> 26:06.525
We took a damn knee
at the Soldier's Shoot-out.

26:06.608 --> 26:07.901
We ain't getting the calls today.

26:08.694 --> 26:12.573
I done lost and I can't win

26:12.656 --> 26:17.744
-Oh, Lord
-So much pain and suffering

26:17.828 --> 26:25.586
-I done lost the joy
-I done lost the joy I had

26:25.669 --> 26:26.670
Hey.

26:27.337 --> 26:29.506
Hey, you hear me? Look at me.

26:29.590 --> 26:32.676
Learn some damn respect.
People fought for that flag.

26:33.844 --> 26:36.722
So much pain and suffering

26:37.431 --> 26:42.186
Heavy burdens weigh me down

26:44.897 --> 26:46.440
What is it, baby?

26:51.320 --> 26:52.321
Coach Warrick.

27:01.413 --> 27:02.748
I mean--

27:05.417 --> 27:08.003
He would do these things

27:08.921 --> 27:10.839
that he didn't do to anyone else.

27:16.011 --> 27:18.055
He made me think I was special.

27:22.559 --> 27:24.019
He touched me.

27:27.022 --> 27:28.398
What are you saying?

27:35.239 --> 27:38.742
I'm so sorry. So sorry.

27:41.995 --> 27:42.996
Yeah!

27:48.085 --> 27:49.378
Let's go, boys.

27:53.590 --> 27:55.717
Way to go, Dominion! Let's go!

27:59.221 --> 28:01.431
What? Tell me where I fouled him?

28:01.515 --> 28:03.016
This is bullshit.

28:03.100 --> 28:05.143
Did you teach 'em how to foul, Osama?

28:08.647 --> 28:11.692
So much pain and suffering

28:11.775 --> 28:13.944
So much pain

28:14.027 --> 28:16.488
-Up top!
-And suffering

28:16.572 --> 28:18.574
Come on! Let's go! Let's go!
Come on!

28:18.657 --> 28:20.784
Suffering

28:20.868 --> 28:22.619
Yeah

28:25.080 --> 28:27.708
What the hell, bruh?
What are you doing?

28:28.500 --> 28:30.502
Get ahead! Get ahead!

28:30.586 --> 28:31.587
No foul!

28:31.670 --> 28:33.380
Foul! What?

28:33.463 --> 28:36.633
No call? Come on, Ref!
Give me a damn break!

28:37.551 --> 28:38.677
Good call, Ref!

28:38.760 --> 28:41.221
Technical foul on gold. Coach. Two shots.

28:44.057 --> 28:46.476
Yeah, let's go.
Let's go! Let's go!

28:48.645 --> 28:53.692
We are holding two of the best players
in the DMV to single digits.

28:53.775 --> 28:56.528
Huh? Huh? Great job out there. Right?

28:57.070 --> 28:59.448
Their heads are all scrambled.
They're not in the game.

28:59.531 --> 29:02.034
You keep disciplined.
You keep up the defensive pressure.

29:02.117 --> 29:03.827
Keep attacking.

29:03.911 --> 29:05.329
Phil, on the inbound,

29:05.412 --> 29:09.750
you gonna have Vince and Nick
set the double screen for Jace.

29:09.833 --> 29:10.709
Get the ball to him.

29:10.792 --> 29:14.630
Vince, I need this screen
for Nick to get open.

29:14.713 --> 29:16.507
Jace, you find him.

29:17.090 --> 29:19.843
All right. We're down 12.
Let's pick it up!

29:19.927 --> 29:21.303
Come on. Let's get it.

29:23.764 --> 29:24.765
Swagger on three!

29:24.848 --> 29:26.808
-One, two, three! Swagger!
-Swagger!

29:26.892 --> 29:28.060
Our team looks good.

29:28.143 --> 29:30.395
Yes, sir.
They're really good for the brand.

29:30.479 --> 29:31.813
Side out, gold!

29:31.897 --> 29:34.942
Hey, zero.
You should have some damn respect, huh?

29:35.025 --> 29:37.569
My taxes paid for your kicks
and your food stamps.

29:38.153 --> 29:40.948
Get your stupid ass down here
and say it to my face!

29:41.031 --> 29:42.241
Get outta here.

29:42.324 --> 29:45.077
-Hey, hey, hey!
-Tee 'em up! Tee 'em outta here!

29:45.744 --> 29:48.872
You're an embarrassment.
You're an embarrassment to the game!

29:48.956 --> 29:52.084
You're an embarrassment to the country.
Embarrassing.

29:54.503 --> 29:55.504
It's terrible!

29:55.587 --> 29:57.381
-Go back to Africa!
-Get 'em outta here!

29:57.464 --> 30:00.175
-That's enough of this shit. Call it.
-What?

30:00.259 --> 30:02.761
They're playing against
the Dominion Ballers, the refs,

30:02.845 --> 30:04.346
this crazy-ass crowd.

30:04.429 --> 30:06.849
-Nothing good is coming of this.
-They don't wanna quit.

30:07.474 --> 30:08.684
They already quit.

30:08.767 --> 30:10.686
Commie! Un-American!

30:12.980 --> 30:14.398
Get ready to help!

30:14.898 --> 30:16.316
Get ready to help! Deny him!

30:17.234 --> 30:19.695
-You guys are trash!
-Great pass, 25!

30:19.778 --> 30:22.948
Such a disgrace!
Our team can play better!

30:23.031 --> 30:24.992
Will you please just be over there?

30:31.164 --> 30:33.000
Hey, hey! Can I have the ball?

30:34.543 --> 30:35.836
Get that!

30:47.055 --> 30:49.349
It's all day! It's all day!

30:49.433 --> 30:51.935
Hey, shut your mouth, ese,
or I'll call Border Patrol!

30:52.019 --> 30:53.395
Yeah, I'm callin' ICE!

30:53.478 --> 30:54.688
-Come on, Jimmy.
-Yeah!

30:54.771 --> 30:56.940
ICE! ICE! ICE!

30:57.024 --> 30:59.526
ICE! ICE! ICE! ICE!

30:59.610 --> 31:00.736
ICE! ICE!

31:00.819 --> 31:02.988
He's Puerto Rican, assholes!

31:03.071 --> 31:04.239
Whatever!

31:04.323 --> 31:06.992
Hey. Yeah.
It's getting kind of crazy out there.

31:07.075 --> 31:09.703
-Shut it down?
-Yeah, yeah. Shut it down. Shut it down.

31:09.786 --> 31:11.580
ICE! ICE! ICE!

31:11.663 --> 31:12.706
You suck!

31:13.916 --> 31:16.168
Please, hold on!

31:16.251 --> 31:18.921
Look, look. Let's keep it classy, huh?

31:20.005 --> 31:24.635
Now, I know some of y'all were offended
by the actions of these young men.

31:25.594 --> 31:28.764
But our soldiers also fought
for freedom of speech!

31:30.891 --> 31:32.643
Two wrongs don't make a right!

31:33.227 --> 31:34.645
Okay, folks?

31:34.728 --> 31:35.854
Come on, you with me?

31:36.522 --> 31:37.564
Come on, guys.

32:24.319 --> 32:25.904
We could get out of here and leave.

32:28.031 --> 32:29.867
Coach Meg, Coach Naim…

32:32.035 --> 32:33.996
They feel like y'all had enough
for one day.

32:34.872 --> 32:36.498
And you know what? Maybe they right.

32:39.668 --> 32:41.128
Folks in them stands…

32:42.379 --> 32:43.964
forgot y'all were kids.

32:44.923 --> 32:46.508
Just like at the restaurant.

32:51.054 --> 32:52.890
And maybe I forgot that too.

32:55.350 --> 32:58.061
You wanna leave, no hard feelings.

33:00.314 --> 33:03.692
But if y'all wanna stay?
Play y'all asses off!

33:04.860 --> 33:05.944
It's your choice.

33:06.028 --> 33:07.529
Coach, players only, please?

33:08.739 --> 33:09.865
What?

33:14.119 --> 33:15.412
Players-only meeting.

33:24.213 --> 33:25.506
Okay.

33:39.061 --> 33:41.688
All I'm sayin' is
there's a time and a place.

33:41.772 --> 33:43.982
No, you're right.
You're absolutely right.

33:44.858 --> 33:45.984
I get it.

33:52.533 --> 33:53.742
I'll be right back.

33:59.498 --> 34:02.835
If I were them, I'd leave.
They've got nothin' to prove.

34:06.296 --> 34:07.631
My pops would say,

34:08.799 --> 34:11.176
"Every great athlete
has somethin' to prove."

34:13.053 --> 34:15.264
-Coaches too?
-Sure.

34:16.181 --> 34:17.724
What you tryin' to prove?

34:19.976 --> 34:21.143
I don't know.

34:24.773 --> 34:27.985
Just know if we leave now, like this,
the way they feelin',

34:29.527 --> 34:31.446
I might never get them to buy in again.

34:32.239 --> 34:35.868
They feel angry at the world, Ike,
and you know what that feels like.

34:37.119 --> 34:38.871
And I know how the world sees 'em.

34:40.956 --> 34:44.751
Just 'cause I took a knee
don't mean I'm blind to that shit.

34:47.004 --> 34:49.255
High school, college coaches?

34:50.882 --> 34:54.428
They know how to rehabilitate a kid
that messed up on drugs or something.

34:56.554 --> 34:59.766
They don't know how to rehabilitate a kid
who thinks he's Malcolm X.

35:03.395 --> 35:05.189
Y'all seen that statue outside the gym?

35:06.481 --> 35:08.942
How they gonna lift up people
who fought against slavery

35:09.026 --> 35:11.320
and lift up people who fought for it?

35:11.904 --> 35:13.447
They try and have it both ways.

35:16.366 --> 35:17.659
Like some of us in this room.

35:19.661 --> 35:23.665
Tryin' to be on the team
without bein' with the team.

35:23.749 --> 35:26.543
-What the hell are you talkin' about?
-Why didn't you kneel, Nick Mendez?

35:26.627 --> 35:28.795
Because I don't jump
when Jace Carson says "jump."

35:28.879 --> 35:29.922
I'm not with the team?

35:30.005 --> 35:32.633
After everything we went through today,
you should've been down with us!

35:32.716 --> 35:34.718
If I'm down for one of you,
I'm down for all of you!

35:34.801 --> 35:36.178
Ain't that how it's supposed to go?

35:36.261 --> 35:38.180
Bro, what the hell are you sayin', bruh?

35:38.263 --> 35:41.016
If I took a knee,
Royale would've been standin' by himself.

35:41.099 --> 35:42.768
I wasn't gonna let that happen!

35:42.851 --> 35:44.353
You should've been down with us too.

35:44.436 --> 35:47.314
Your family's money stop the cops
from messin' with you today?

35:47.898 --> 35:49.441
-What does it matter?
-What?

35:49.525 --> 35:50.484
What does it matter?

35:50.567 --> 35:52.152
-It matters!
-No, it doesn't!

35:53.028 --> 35:55.906
You all full of shit!
Talkin' 'bout brotherhood.

35:57.407 --> 35:59.701
If I kneel, if I stand,

36:00.285 --> 36:02.538
it's not gonna change how you all see me.

36:02.621 --> 36:03.705
Or how you all treat me.

36:05.082 --> 36:07.459
Look, I didn't like what went down
with the cops either,

36:07.543 --> 36:10.087
but that's how you make me feel
every single day.

36:10.170 --> 36:11.463
Like I don't belong.

36:12.047 --> 36:13.048
And why?

36:13.674 --> 36:14.967
'Cause my parents got money?

36:16.218 --> 36:18.679
-'Cause I don't live in Seat Pleasant?
-I don't either.

36:18.762 --> 36:20.222
-So what?
-You don't think I can play!

36:23.517 --> 36:24.810
That I don't know the game.

36:26.019 --> 36:27.187
Am I right?

36:27.271 --> 36:29.147
-He ain't lyin'.
-A whole nother conversation.

36:29.231 --> 36:30.732
That's why I'm not one of y'all.

36:31.900 --> 36:33.110
But I can play.

36:33.735 --> 36:35.946
And I do know the game.

36:36.989 --> 36:39.658
You wanna know why number five
on the Ballers is killin' us?

36:39.741 --> 36:41.785
'Cause he's attackin'
with the off-ball screen.

36:41.869 --> 36:43.245
Same when we played 'em before.

36:43.996 --> 36:47.416
Last game, he came off
the double screen 13 times.

36:47.499 --> 36:49.501
He did that to you four times, Drew.

36:49.585 --> 36:52.212
And Vince, he pump-faked you twice,

36:52.296 --> 36:54.131
'cause you play too aggressively.

36:54.715 --> 36:57.426
The last seven times,
he attacked the rim after the catch.

36:57.926 --> 36:59.636
Three times he beat Ricky to the hoop.

36:59.720 --> 37:02.347
And the other four times,
he dished off when Phil came to help.

37:05.475 --> 37:06.852
-Damn.
-What?

37:06.935 --> 37:08.604
Yo, dude learns by memorizing.

37:08.687 --> 37:10.898
Yeah, that was some freaky shit, bro.

37:10.981 --> 37:13.150
-For real.
-That shit crazy.

37:13.233 --> 37:14.943
Boy, you analyzed the hell out that game.

37:15.027 --> 37:16.028
Totally.

37:16.737 --> 37:20.324
Hey, man. Thank you for having
that announcer guy tone it down.

37:20.407 --> 37:21.783
Nah, listen. It's no problem.

37:21.867 --> 37:24.870
Makes no sense for these people
to treat your team like that.

37:24.953 --> 37:26.413
Well, I appreciate it.

37:27.206 --> 37:30.584
I was just comin' to watch my kids
trounce the Gladiator-sponsored team.

37:33.045 --> 37:37.466
But if you knew what it took for us
to get here, it just seems superficial.

37:39.218 --> 37:41.512
Well, there's nothing superficial
about teaching kids

37:41.595 --> 37:43.555
that there's a time and place
for everything.

37:44.139 --> 37:45.641
Excuse me?

37:45.724 --> 37:48.852
Come on.
Look, that was a dumbass move, Meg.

37:48.936 --> 37:52.564
You guys tried to ruin my event,
but it's not gonna happen like that.

37:53.190 --> 37:55.526
Your event
with a Confederate flag on the wall?

37:56.151 --> 37:59.029
I wish it was red, black, and green. Okay?

38:00.614 --> 38:03.700
Actually, I kinda like knowin'
where people are comin' from.

38:05.118 --> 38:06.411
You can't be that oblivious.

38:07.746 --> 38:09.915
Is that a nice, liberal way
of calling me a sellout?

38:12.960 --> 38:14.086
I've been called worse.

38:14.711 --> 38:16.547
-Enjoy the second half.
-You too.

38:16.630 --> 38:20.884
Felt like the crazier the crowd got,
the crazier we got with each other.

38:20.968 --> 38:22.511
You mean like you yellin' at me?

38:22.594 --> 38:24.221
Or you yellin' at me, bruh?

38:28.183 --> 38:31.895
On the strength,
I really don't care if y'all knelt or not.

38:33.021 --> 38:34.606
I don't care about that crowd.

38:36.441 --> 38:40.612
All day, people been lookin' at us
and assumin' they know us.

38:43.156 --> 38:45.284
They think we don't got the right
to have swagger.

38:47.995 --> 38:50.664
Right? That's bullshit.

38:50.747 --> 38:52.207
We're America.

38:54.418 --> 38:56.044
Right here, in this room.

38:57.588 --> 39:00.465
And whether we decide to leave or stay…

39:02.259 --> 39:03.844
we gotta be together on this.

39:05.596 --> 39:07.014
Family.

39:29.036 --> 39:30.037
We're stayin'.

39:33.916 --> 39:34.917
Let's go.

39:35.000 --> 39:36.960
-Yeah. Let's get it.
-Come on, y'all.

39:55.270 --> 39:58.899
Left! Hang left, hang left!

40:00.651 --> 40:02.361
Hey, talk to each other!

40:03.987 --> 40:05.280
Rotate!

40:12.788 --> 40:15.457
Yeah, bro! Let's go!
That's how you do it, all right?

40:15.541 --> 40:16.625
Let's go, bro.

40:20.546 --> 40:22.047
Get 'em. Get 'em! Get 'em!

40:22.714 --> 40:24.466
Hey, get through! Get through!

40:28.470 --> 40:31.014
What you gonna do, bro?
What you gonna do? Get outta my face.

40:39.022 --> 40:42.192
Slow down. Hands up! Hands up!

40:50.158 --> 40:52.578
-Y'all should've stayed home.
-Go back to Mexico!

41:00.502 --> 41:01.712
Here! I'm open!

41:03.964 --> 41:05.257
Up top, up top.

41:05.340 --> 41:06.592
Let's go! Let's go!

41:08.594 --> 41:09.887
Ricky!

41:13.223 --> 41:15.642
That's it. Let's do it! Come on. Come on.

41:15.726 --> 41:16.977
What they talkin' 'bout?

41:22.858 --> 41:24.359
Get outta here, man.

41:25.152 --> 41:27.613
Coach. I think you should put
Royale in for me.

41:28.822 --> 41:30.490
What, you-- You quittin'?

41:30.574 --> 41:31.867
Hell no.

41:33.118 --> 41:34.369
Are you crazy?

41:35.078 --> 41:36.413
I don't think so.

41:37.372 --> 41:38.624
I think he's got this, Coach.

41:42.211 --> 41:43.378
Royale!

41:44.463 --> 41:45.672
You in for Drew.

41:47.341 --> 41:49.051
-Yes, Coach.
-Sub!

41:51.803 --> 41:53.180
You got this, man.

41:58.435 --> 41:59.686
That's what I need!

42:00.687 --> 42:02.064
Yeah!

42:12.366 --> 42:14.201
-Yeah!
-Time-out.

42:14.284 --> 42:15.577
Hey! Time-out!

42:15.661 --> 42:19.206
Hey, yo! Your defense is on fire, man!
How you so locked in?

42:19.289 --> 42:21.291
Well, 13 times he came off the screen.

42:21.375 --> 42:23.794
The other six times,
he curled off the screen and made a three.

42:23.877 --> 42:25.379
-The last three--
-Okay. Royale, Royale.

42:25.462 --> 42:26.630
Just keep doin' what you're doin'.

42:33.554 --> 42:34.888
Boo!

42:34.972 --> 42:37.850
Go. Go! Get that double!

42:41.979 --> 42:44.356
Yeah, shoot, yeah! Attaway, guys!

42:54.700 --> 42:57.536
Yo, Nick! Yo, you got this!

42:57.619 --> 42:59.913
-I know!
-Nah, man. You don't know.

43:00.455 --> 43:03.584
But I'm telling you,
it's all outside noise.

43:06.044 --> 43:07.754
They got me so jacked up.

43:07.838 --> 43:10.382
Forget them. It's about us.

43:12.718 --> 43:15.429
We here. Right here.

43:51.256 --> 43:53.091
Come on. Let's go.

44:22.704 --> 44:24.456
Hey. Maybe we should call time-out.

44:24.540 --> 44:26.625
No, no, no. Let 'em go. Let 'em go.

44:26.708 --> 44:28.460
Phil! Put it up, bruh!

45:03.871 --> 45:06.874
Yeah! Yeah!

45:06.957 --> 45:08.959
Let's go!

45:12.296 --> 45:13.797
No basket! No basket!

45:13.881 --> 45:15.132
He didn't get it off in time!

45:16.133 --> 45:18.135
No! You're gonna rob my kids?

45:19.094 --> 45:22.431
They kids! You can't do this to some kids!

45:23.056 --> 45:24.057
Game's over.

45:24.808 --> 45:27.561
That's a bad call. Bad call.

45:31.857 --> 45:33.984
Bobby! Bobby!

45:34.067 --> 45:36.653
That's impossible! You know that's a lie!

45:44.036 --> 45:45.704
Sucks. Come on, man.

46:34.628 --> 46:36.713
See what you've been missin'
all these years?

46:36.797 --> 46:38.799
Is that the norm for your games?

46:39.842 --> 46:41.718
Just another day at the office.

46:45.681 --> 46:49.893
Can't say I-- I liked seein'
you and your team take a knee.

46:51.353 --> 46:53.146
But the way they treated them,

46:53.230 --> 46:56.275
the way they waved off that last shot,
that was bullshit.

46:56.358 --> 46:57.693
And I'm not just sayin' that.

47:00.362 --> 47:01.864
I appreciate that.

47:08.453 --> 47:09.955
Gotta get them home.

47:10.038 --> 47:12.791
Yeah, do you think,
sometime in the next couple of days,

47:12.875 --> 47:14.626
you could stop by the house?

47:14.710 --> 47:16.128
Go over a couple of things?

47:17.588 --> 47:18.589
Sure.

47:20.215 --> 47:21.466
Treatments are going well?

47:24.720 --> 47:25.846
We should talk.

47:29.391 --> 47:30.392
Okay.

47:31.476 --> 47:32.686
Thanks for coming.

47:33.395 --> 47:34.605
Good job today.

47:39.818 --> 47:41.653
Our boys pulled out a big win.

47:41.737 --> 47:44.072
Yeah.
Bit of a controversial ending though.

47:44.156 --> 47:46.450
Which keeps people talking
about Gladiator.

47:46.533 --> 47:48.243
Well done.

47:48.327 --> 47:50.370
-Give me a call.
-Yes. Yes, sir.

48:45.592 --> 48:48.136
Just a basketball team
on the way to our game.

48:48.220 --> 48:50.347
Everybody, stand up.
Hands on the table, right now.

48:50.430 --> 48:52.099
-For what?
-Listen to these officers!

48:52.182 --> 48:55.352
We're complying. There's no problem.

48:57.604 --> 49:00.065
Anyone have any outstanding warrants?

49:05.153 --> 49:06.697
No warrants.

49:06.780 --> 49:08.407
We're gonna need your IDs.

49:08.490 --> 49:09.700
Come on, y'all.

49:10.909 --> 49:12.452
Can't breathe in here anyway.

49:59.374 --> 50:02.085
I can't breathe!

50:02.878 --> 50:04.755
What the hell's goin' on here?

50:04.838 --> 50:32.658
I can't breathe!

50:33.742 --> 50:35.035
What the hell?

50:35.118 --> 50:36.495
I'll be back.

50:37.204 --> 50:39.206
-Phil!
-Don't worry, Coach. I got him.

50:39.289 --> 50:41.083
-Jace! But--
-I got him, Coach.

50:41.166 --> 50:44.962
I can't breathe! I can't breathe!

50:45.045 --> 50:46.630
I can't breathe!

50:46.713 --> 50:51.134
I can't breathe! I can't breathe!

50:51.218 --> 50:53.971
Ike. Ike!

50:54.054 --> 50:56.306
-What?
-You got eyes on 'em?

50:56.390 --> 50:57.724
Yeah!

50:57.808 --> 50:59.768
-Then we're good.
-What?

51:00.686 --> 51:01.895
They need this.

51:07.568 --> 51:09.027
You get that, right?

51:10.320 --> 51:11.446
We need this.

51:41.351 --> 51:45.606
I can't breathe!

51:45.689 --> 51:47.024
This more team building?

51:48.233 --> 51:49.443
I guess so.

51:52.988 --> 51:55.490
-You all right?
-Yeah.

51:56.867 --> 51:59.494
There's no crying in basketball.
You know that, right?

52:00.412 --> 52:04.416
I bet there's some old video of you
somewhere that would beg to differ.

52:07.377 --> 52:13.425
I can't breathe!

52:17.554 --> 52:18.722
Hey, yo.

52:19.806 --> 52:22.935
You that team from Carolyn's restaurant?
Y'all took a knee at that game?

52:23.018 --> 52:26.104
Yeah. Swagger DMV. How you know?

52:26.188 --> 52:28.524
Yo, they're calling y'all radicals
on the IG.

52:28.607 --> 52:29.858
Let me get a pic real quick?

52:31.235 --> 52:32.236
For sure.

52:32.319 --> 52:34.279
All right. Bet, bet, bet.

52:34.363 --> 52:39.201
I can't breathe!
I can't breathe! I can't breathe!

52:39.284 --> 52:41.036
I can't breathe!

52:41.119 --> 52:43.205
Yo, respect. Appreciate you, kid.

52:43.288 --> 52:44.665
Keep doin' your thing, aight?

52:44.748 --> 52:46.208
I got you.

52:46.291 --> 52:48.627
We are what America looks like!

52:48.710 --> 52:58.053
We are what America looks like!
We are what America looks like!

53:31.253 --> 53:33.881
Now more than ever,
I want to get to Florida for Nationals.

53:34.923 --> 53:37.634
Have to win every game
on the schedule to pull that off.

53:37.718 --> 53:40.637
You said
that you wanted to tell those cops

53:41.638 --> 53:45.142
that I would have the type of success
that y'all could only dream of.

53:48.103 --> 53:49.646
You meant that?

53:51.231 --> 53:54.151
Nah. I was lying.

53:55.652 --> 53:57.613
Yeah, right. You meant it.

53:57.696 --> 53:59.198
…what America looks like!

53:59.281 --> 54:03.827
We are what America looks like!
We are what America looks like!

54:27.226 --> 54:29.561
We are what America looks like!

54:29.645 --> 54:38.779
We are what America looks like!
We are what America looks like!
