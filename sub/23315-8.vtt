WEBVTT

00:01.233 --> 00:01.433
.

00:10.633 --> 00:12.900
Oi, oi! We're back!

00:16.467 --> 00:18.967
Get me back in that house.
Ah!

00:19.033 --> 00:21.933
Stand by. Geordies incoming.

00:24.000 --> 00:26.167
Oh. My. God.

00:27.967 --> 00:32.333
I'm so excited,
I ca-ca-poo-poo'd in my
knickers.

00:36.267 --> 00:37.433
(shattering)

00:38.967 --> 00:41.900
What's the three things
that Geordies are good at?

00:41.967 --> 00:43.567
Bucking...

00:43.633 --> 00:45.400
...necking...

00:45.467 --> 00:46.867
...and drinking.

00:49.100 --> 00:51.300
Toon, we are coming for you.

00:54.900 --> 00:57.600
Shit's about to go down.

00:57.667 --> 00:59.100
This is mint.

01:08.067 --> 01:10.600
(cheering)

01:12.767 --> 01:15.833
Steph's flirting with Aaron
cos Marnie isn't here.

01:15.900 --> 01:19.600
Howay, Sam, we're going
to the bathroom for a quickie.

01:19.667 --> 01:21.967
Fuck! I nearly killed Joel.

01:22.033 --> 01:24.567
I was gonna relieve
my sexual frustration.

01:24.633 --> 01:27.633
But now he's got his head
in a bucket.

01:32.567 --> 01:33.900
Oh, my God!

01:33.967 --> 01:37.867
I can feel the negative energy
of my ex-boyfriends oozing out

01:37.933 --> 01:39.133
like a shit.

01:39.200 --> 01:42.667
That has sorted me right out.
We're getting on better than
ever.

01:42.733 --> 01:45.467
I know for a fact
he will not fuck up.

01:48.367 --> 01:50.733
I am so fucking angry!

01:50.800 --> 01:52.067
Stop, stop.

01:52.133 --> 01:53.800
This is fucked now.

01:56.733 --> 01:59.300
I'm a natural beauty.
Real boobs, real hair.

01:59.367 --> 02:02.300
I'm a lad who's got more cheek
than a girl with fillers.

02:02.367 --> 02:05.133
I'm tanned, toned
and ready to tash on.

02:05.200 --> 02:07.100
I'm preened to perfection.

02:07.167 --> 02:09.400
I'm totally crackers, me, like.

02:09.467 --> 02:12.100
I'm cheeky, colourful
and full of mischief.

02:12.167 --> 02:14.900
I can talk the back legs
off a donkey.

02:14.967 --> 02:18.700
I might be entirely bonkers,
but all the best people are.

02:18.767 --> 02:21.233
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

02:31.567 --> 02:34.067
(Sam) I've woke up this morning
and I feel shit.

02:34.133 --> 02:37.200
Me and Chloe argued cos she saw
me
talking to another girl.

02:37.267 --> 02:38.933
It got out of control.

02:39.000 --> 02:43.400
Do you think if I stay in this
room
all day everyone will forget?

02:46.833 --> 02:48.200
Why am I in here?

02:48.267 --> 02:49.567
I don't know.

02:49.633 --> 02:51.133
How do you feel?

02:51.200 --> 02:54.400
I think it's weird,
cos we're getting on so well.

02:54.467 --> 02:58.267
He's changed. That wasn't him,
the way he went on last night.

02:58.333 --> 03:01.800
I've woke up this morning still
devastated about what happened.

03:01.867 --> 03:05.433
I feel like Sam has built us up
so much, I had so much hope.

03:05.500 --> 03:07.033
He's just knocked us down.

03:07.100 --> 03:09.400
The boy's an idiot
who thinks with his dick.

03:09.467 --> 03:12.700
Right now I don't know whether
Sam is putting on an act,

03:12.767 --> 03:17.067
or this is actually him, he's
stupid
and doesn't think before he
speaks.

03:17.133 --> 03:19.567
If he wants to be single
and get girls, crack on.

03:19.633 --> 03:21.300
I just wish he told us earlier.

03:21.367 --> 03:24.600
The fact that everyone is on
my side, I know I'm in the
right.

03:24.667 --> 03:26.433
I want an apology off Sam.

03:26.500 --> 03:29.233
Even though it kicked off,
I had a really good night.

03:29.300 --> 03:31.233
Steph was happy when you came
back.

03:31.300 --> 03:34.067
Steph would have been excited
cos she's my friend.

03:37.100 --> 03:40.633
It was good to hang out with
Steph,
but she knows I have a
girlfriend.

03:40.700 --> 03:44.067
Plus, there's my history with
Marnie. It's never gonna happen.

03:44.133 --> 03:46.900
I'm happy to be back.
We're happy you're back.

03:57.567 --> 04:01.167
I'm back! I've sorted
everything out with Casey.

04:01.233 --> 04:05.200
I haven't told these radgies
that
I'm coming. I'm gonna surprise
them.

04:05.267 --> 04:08.733
Morning, you bunch of pissheads!
What the actual fuck?!

04:08.800 --> 04:10.967
Marnie! I can't believe it!

04:11.033 --> 04:13.033
I'm so glad you're back.

04:13.100 --> 04:14.600
I missed you.

04:14.667 --> 04:18.533
I was over the moon that Aaron
came back, but now Marnie's
back.

04:18.600 --> 04:20.433
The family's complete.

04:20.500 --> 04:22.033
So, what's been going on?

04:22.100 --> 04:23.733
A lot.
What's been going on?

04:23.800 --> 04:25.233
What time do you call this?

04:25.300 --> 04:28.500
I had to make a quick exit,
cos I had too much going on.

04:28.567 --> 04:30.933
Aaron's back now.
Really?

04:31.000 --> 04:34.733
I'm so pleased Aaron is back,
cos
it means the whole family is
back.

04:34.800 --> 04:38.567
This whole bracelet situation
is behind us and we can be
friends.

04:38.633 --> 04:40.733
So excited to know
what's been going on.

04:40.800 --> 04:45.300
Tenerife was very good. It was
sort
of where Sam made his decision.

04:45.367 --> 04:47.867
(gasps) Who won?!
Chloe.

04:47.933 --> 04:50.933
Abbie.
Chloe and Sam had the
connection.

04:51.000 --> 04:55.333
So, it was time for me to take
a step back and let them crack
on.

04:55.400 --> 04:57.267
That's very mature of you.

04:57.333 --> 05:00.500
I knew Marnie would be proud.
I'm taking one for the girls.

05:00.567 --> 05:02.700
To be honest, after last night,

05:02.767 --> 05:06.700
I'm glad I'm not involved
in the Chloe and Sam shit
anymore.

05:06.767 --> 05:09.567
What's going on with them two?
Oh, Marnie.

05:09.633 --> 05:11.867
Come on...
It all ended last night.

05:11.933 --> 05:13.333
It was so bad.

05:13.400 --> 05:15.567
Caught him chatting a girl up.

05:15.633 --> 05:19.400
No, no, no, not this again.
I feel sorry for her.

05:19.467 --> 05:22.833
I've been through this so many
times
with Chloe and Marty.

05:22.900 --> 05:25.100
I don't want the same path with
Sam.

05:25.167 --> 05:27.300
I hope that Sam sorts himself
out.

05:27.367 --> 05:31.233
I'm gonna go see the boys.
Go and catch up, Marns.

05:32.367 --> 05:35.700
There's a spot at the end of my
nose
that's fucking killing.

05:35.767 --> 05:38.000
Morning!

05:38.067 --> 05:41.367
There's Marns!
When the fuck did she get here?

05:41.433 --> 05:43.633
Hello.
Come on.

05:43.700 --> 05:46.767
Marnie's back and I'm buzzing.
I've missed the radgie.

05:46.833 --> 05:50.200
I can't wait to go out on the
Toon
with my best mate.

05:55.033 --> 05:56.267
(farts)

05:57.767 --> 06:00.033
Oh!
What's been happening then?

06:00.100 --> 06:04.700
I am so buzzing that Marnie's
back.
I'm going back to being a
lesbian.

06:04.767 --> 06:07.500
I'm so happy to be back.
You missed the drama.

06:07.567 --> 06:10.433
Chloe turned into the Hulk.
What I did was out of order.

06:10.500 --> 06:13.400
I shouldn't have went for him,
but he was laughing.

06:13.467 --> 06:15.733
How've you left it? Where is he?
Shag Pad.

06:15.800 --> 06:19.267
I bet he's scared to come in.
I know how Sam is feeling.

06:19.333 --> 06:22.967
When you piss off the family
it's more nerve-racking to say
sorry

06:23.033 --> 06:25.367
than it was for me
walking to my fight.

06:25.433 --> 06:28.400
It's nice we're all back
together
even if it is awkward.

06:28.467 --> 06:30.733
You gonna get drunk tonight?
Gonna go wild.

06:30.800 --> 06:32.533
Marns, let's get it out.

06:32.600 --> 06:34.267
It's great to have Marnie back,

06:34.333 --> 06:36.800
but I hope it doesn't effect
wuh friendship.

06:36.867 --> 06:39.200
Cos we had such a laugh last
night.

06:46.400 --> 06:47.567
Hi, everyone.

06:47.633 --> 06:49.367
Hello, Morticia.

06:49.433 --> 06:52.633
Marnie's just come back
and now Anna's just walked in

06:52.700 --> 06:55.567
to fucking lower the mood.
Get the fuck back outside.

06:55.633 --> 06:58.567
Aaron and Marnie,
am I glad to see yous two back.

06:58.633 --> 07:00.500
Same.
Where's Sam at?

07:00.567 --> 07:03.033
In the Shag Pad.
Would someone fetch him?

07:03.100 --> 07:04.600
Ooh.

07:04.667 --> 07:07.600
Yous, can we not?
I haven't seen Sam since last
night.

07:07.667 --> 07:09.900
I have to speak to him,
but I'd rather not.

07:09.967 --> 07:12.500
Thanks, Anna!
There he is.

07:12.567 --> 07:14.300
Welcome, Sam.
Hiya, all right?

07:14.367 --> 07:16.967
I walk in
and nobody even looks at me.

07:17.033 --> 07:18.467
This is very awkward.

07:20.067 --> 07:22.300
I can hear Sam's presence
at the back of us,

07:22.367 --> 07:25.867
but am I fuck looking at his
face.
I can't be arsed.

07:25.933 --> 07:29.567
Tonight, I want you to go back
to what you do best.

07:29.633 --> 07:35.033
You'll be running a Toon Tours
extravaganza in Edinburgh.

07:35.100 --> 07:37.000
(cheering)

07:37.067 --> 07:41.300
I can't wait to go to Scotland
cos
lads wear kilts with no pants
on.

07:41.367 --> 07:44.867
I'm gonna stride all the
fuckers.
Loads of cock in Edinburgh!

07:44.933 --> 07:47.867
(chanting) Scotland! Scotland!
Scotland! Scotland!

07:47.933 --> 07:49.200
Going to Scotland.

07:49.267 --> 07:52.400
I guess I can't crawl back
into the Shag Pad and hide.

07:52.467 --> 07:55.333
Now, we all know
how the Scots like a drink.

07:55.400 --> 07:59.833
But I want you to show them
how to really party.

07:59.900 --> 08:01.633
Geordie Style.

08:01.700 --> 08:05.967
Anna, I have never heard
a true word spoken from you.

08:06.033 --> 08:09.967
We will show them Scots
how the Geordies fucking drink.

08:10.033 --> 08:14.200
But I do have some bad news
for you, Chloe.

08:14.267 --> 08:17.067
Your behaviour last night
was unacceptable.

08:17.133 --> 08:20.033
So tonight, there will be
no drinking for you.

08:20.100 --> 08:21.300
OK.

08:21.367 --> 08:23.767
I agree with Anna.
I do deserve a drinking ban.

08:23.833 --> 08:27.433
Cos I don't want to throttle Sam
again, even if he does deserve
it.

08:27.500 --> 08:31.633
Listen, do me proud
and no snogging any Scots.

08:31.700 --> 08:35.433
No snogging the Scots?
I can't promise that, Anna.

08:35.500 --> 08:37.767
Right, howay, let's pack.
(cheering)

08:37.832 --> 08:39.799
(chanting) Packing! Packing!

08:39.866 --> 08:41.567
Scotland! Edinb...

08:41.633 --> 08:43.133
Don't finger me!

08:48.067 --> 08:50.700
I'm so excited for Edinburgh.
I've never been.

08:50.767 --> 08:53.767
I want to get packed
and get on the road.

08:53.833 --> 08:57.100
In Scotland they wear kilts
and they've got the bare cock.

08:57.167 --> 08:59.433
Eurgh.
You'll be fine to pull tonight.

08:59.500 --> 09:01.933
Fuck me, I'm not cock shy,

09:02.000 --> 09:05.000
but all that dick on the street
is too much for me.

09:05.067 --> 09:07.533
Chloe, that was awkward with
Sam.
I know.

09:07.600 --> 09:10.800
Have you said anything to him?
Nah. I'm not saying anything.

09:10.867 --> 09:13.600
Do you think if he apologised
you'd go back with him?

09:13.667 --> 09:17.200
I don't know.
This journey is gonna be
awkward.

09:17.267 --> 09:20.733
Isn't it? We could have been
going to Edinburgh as a couple.

09:20.800 --> 09:23.033
But no, we're not,
we're going as enemies.

09:23.100 --> 09:27.233
He asked for a girl's number.
Sick of boys treating us like a
mug.

09:27.300 --> 09:30.267
We'll have to wait and see.
(burps)

09:32.033 --> 09:35.033
Fucking last night
got blown out of proportion.

09:35.100 --> 09:39.267
This morning has been awful
and made me think I do like
Chloe.

09:39.333 --> 09:42.000
Although I didn't effectively
do anything wrong,

09:42.067 --> 09:44.467
cos I'm single,
maybe I did overstep the mark.

09:44.533 --> 09:49.400
I was thinking of asking her
to be my girlfriend.

09:49.467 --> 09:53.533
This is huge, but if Sam wants
Chloe
to be his girlfriend,

09:53.600 --> 09:56.333
he's got a lot of making up
to do and fast.

09:56.400 --> 09:58.233
Maybe lay your cards on the
table.

09:58.300 --> 10:01.333
Honesty is the best policy
in this house.

10:04.267 --> 10:07.867
Let's get to fucking Scotland!
Howay!

10:08.900 --> 10:12.733
Fucking hell, Nathan, you look
like
you're going on a business
meeting.

10:12.800 --> 10:16.033
Who the fuck does Nathan think
he is, Geordie Lord Sugar?

10:16.100 --> 10:18.767
I am fucking buzzing!
Edinburgh!

10:18.833 --> 10:20.767
Is it Scotland or Edinburgh?

10:20.833 --> 10:22.700
Edinburgh.

10:25.267 --> 10:26.400
Fucking shit.

10:26.467 --> 10:29.433
I don't know what's worse,
the shed, or fucking Sam.

10:29.500 --> 10:30.967
(screaming)

10:31.033 --> 10:32.767
Loads of cock in Edinburgh!

10:36.633 --> 10:39.900
My boyfriend's not here
and I want a cuddle.

10:39.967 --> 10:42.367
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

10:44.000 --> 10:44.200
.

10:46.700 --> 10:46.900
.

10:59.500 --> 11:01.833
We have been travelling for
ages,

11:01.900 --> 11:04.100
but we've finally arrived
in Edinburgh.

11:04.167 --> 11:07.367
I'm buzzing and I can't wait
to see where we're staying.

11:09.067 --> 11:10.800
(Chloe) What the fuck is this?

11:10.867 --> 11:13.100
We are staying in a shed.

11:13.167 --> 11:15.867
I don't know what's worse,
the shed or Sam.

11:17.433 --> 11:20.633
What's that smell?
I'd rather stay on the bus.

11:20.700 --> 11:24.867
My hair's gonna be fucking wet.
This is fucking shit. Anna's a
twat.

11:24.933 --> 11:29.367
Anna has put us in wigwams.
A fucking wigwam.

11:29.433 --> 11:32.000
Fuck this. Let's get ready for
work.

11:42.967 --> 11:46.767
How do you feel about coming
back and
this is the first thing you
gotta do?

11:46.833 --> 11:49.933
I feel like Anna did it on
purpose
to fuck with us.

11:50.000 --> 11:53.633
When you left, all I knew is
you left with Aaron.

11:53.700 --> 11:56.433
I had to clear my head,
sort things out with Casey.

11:56.500 --> 11:58.567
Everything was up in the air
and a mess.

11:58.633 --> 12:00.833
I knew if I told you,
you'd have stopped us.

12:00.900 --> 12:03.567
I would have.
Marnie knows me too well.

12:03.633 --> 12:05.800
She knows I would
never have let her go.

12:05.867 --> 12:10.100
I'd kill the bitch if she
abandoned
me in the middle of Scotland.

12:10.167 --> 12:13.633
It's so good to see everyone.
It's nice to see Aaron back as
well.

12:17.433 --> 12:19.133
A little bit, Marns.

12:19.200 --> 12:21.900
He's got a girlfriend.
That's disrespectful.

12:21.967 --> 12:25.200
I can't believe Steph
is still trying it on with
Aaron.

12:25.267 --> 12:27.800
Aaron's got a girlfriend
and he's my ex.

12:27.867 --> 12:29.733
Has Steph not heard of girl
code?

12:33.267 --> 12:36.433
I'm not gonna lie, didn't expect
to share a bed with you.

12:36.500 --> 12:38.400
Do you think you might
make back up?

12:38.467 --> 12:41.700
Yeah, I wanna speak to him.
The way I went on was out of
order.

12:41.767 --> 12:45.967
I was angry cos he was laughing.
That was winding us up more.

12:46.033 --> 12:48.100
When I speak about Sam,
I get so angry.

12:48.167 --> 12:52.233
I don't think he realises how
much
I like him and how much it hurt
us.

12:52.300 --> 12:54.600
You need to talk to him
before the night out.

12:54.667 --> 12:56.200
Yeah.
So nothing kicks off.

12:56.267 --> 12:58.600
Maybe it is a good thing
Chloe is sober,

12:58.667 --> 13:01.133
cos it'll stop her kicking off.

13:01.200 --> 13:04.667
I really hope they can work it
out,
cos he does make Chloe so happy.

13:04.733 --> 13:06.567
Nathan, can you stop talking?

13:06.633 --> 13:09.267
I'm trying to do my make up
and all I can hear is you.

13:09.333 --> 13:10.867
Very rude.

13:14.533 --> 13:17.867
I can't believe I've gone a
whole day
without talking to Chloe.

13:17.933 --> 13:20.733
I don't like it.
Maybe she means more than I
thought.

13:20.800 --> 13:23.633
All I know is I have to
talk to her tonight at work.

13:26.267 --> 13:28.700
I am so excited for tonight.

13:28.767 --> 13:33.133
Toon Tours is hitting Edinburgh
and it's gonna be a good one.

13:34.867 --> 13:37.167
Oi, oi!

13:37.233 --> 13:41.867
We've arrived at Toon Tours
and it's packed with mental
Scots.

13:41.933 --> 13:43.867
These lot are louder than us.

13:43.933 --> 13:45.033
You all right?

13:45.100 --> 13:48.500
I never thought I'd say this,
but thank fuck we've got work.

13:48.567 --> 13:51.033
Cos this situation with Sam
is wearing us down.

13:51.100 --> 13:53.733
I need you both to put kilts on.

13:53.800 --> 13:55.567
These two beautiful volunteers

13:55.633 --> 13:58.100
will take your boxers off
with their teeth.

13:58.167 --> 14:01.400
Steph and Abbie have volunteered
to do this game. Fair play.

14:01.467 --> 14:03.767
I wouldn't put my face
in someone's crotch.

14:03.833 --> 14:06.233
How the fuck
are we meant to do this?

14:06.300 --> 14:09.400
I can't believe I've gotta
tear his pants off with my
teeth.

14:09.467 --> 14:10.867
I hope they've had a wash.

14:10.933 --> 14:14.200
Three, two, one!

14:14.267 --> 14:16.633
(cheering)

14:16.700 --> 14:20.500
My face is that close to his
penis,
I want it over and done with.

14:20.567 --> 14:23.000
(cheering)

14:23.067 --> 14:27.500
Steph's already got the boxers
off.
That girl must be gagging for
cock.

14:29.133 --> 14:31.933
Cheers, Steph.
Glad you won that so quickly.

14:32.000 --> 14:33.967
I was dying under there.

14:34.033 --> 14:35.733
(chanting) Off! Off! Off!

14:35.800 --> 14:37.300
(screaming, cheering)

14:37.367 --> 14:40.533
Howay, mate. I was the one that
needed to take your pants off,

14:40.600 --> 14:43.633
didn't need to show everyone
your haggis.

14:49.100 --> 14:53.233
Work's a laugh, but I can't put
this
off. I have to take Chloe for a
chat.

14:53.300 --> 14:55.300
I am shitting it.

14:56.467 --> 15:00.267
First things first, maybe I
shouldn't
have went up and started
talking.

15:00.333 --> 15:03.967
There was nothing in it.
But we're getting together.

15:04.033 --> 15:07.100
We both said we're not gonna
pull.
I didn't wanna pull her.

15:07.167 --> 15:10.500
What better way to start
than straight on the defensive?

15:10.567 --> 15:11.633
What am I doing?

15:11.700 --> 15:16.033
You just went in on us. I only
laughed cos I woulda gone
mental.

15:16.100 --> 15:19.500
Sam's right, my behaviour
last night was really bad.

15:19.567 --> 15:22.400
But he needs to realise
he drove me to that point.

15:22.467 --> 15:24.800
I want him to confess
he was in the wrong too.

15:24.867 --> 15:26.933
I should never have swung.

15:27.000 --> 15:29.433
I only kick off
if someone pisses us off.

15:29.500 --> 15:31.533
I wouldn't kick off
if you didn't do it.

15:31.600 --> 15:34.367
Do you think I wanna kick off?
It's boring.

15:34.433 --> 15:37.400
If I could take it back I would.
We were in a good place.

15:37.467 --> 15:41.033
I've been pissed off all day to
be
honest, cos I got to this level

15:41.100 --> 15:45.267
where we were ready to go to the
next
level and we took two steps
back.

15:45.333 --> 15:47.733
Whose fault's that?
Mine.

15:47.800 --> 15:51.300
Chloe's right. I've really
fucked this up. I need to own
it.

15:51.367 --> 15:53.633
I'm sorry
for what happened last night,

15:53.700 --> 15:58.800
but I want to forget about last
night
and continue as we were.

15:58.867 --> 16:02.633
I have to have a think about it.
You know I like you and do want
to,

16:02.700 --> 16:06.500
but I'm looking out for myself,
cos I don't want to get hurt.

16:06.567 --> 16:09.733
I'm so happy Sam has finally
admitted he's in the wrong.

16:09.800 --> 16:12.867
He's not off the hook yet.
Let's see how tonight goes.

16:17.167 --> 16:18.400
(cheering)

16:18.467 --> 16:22.467
Work has actually been fun for
once.
That says a lot from me.

16:22.533 --> 16:24.133
Now we're off to the club.

16:24.200 --> 16:25.733
Oww!

16:36.500 --> 16:39.867
We've got to Opal
and the place is fucking packed.

16:39.933 --> 16:42.567
This is gonna be a belter.

16:44.900 --> 16:46.567
Now me and Chloe have made up,

16:46.633 --> 16:49.067
I can sense tonight
is gonna be a good night.

16:54.100 --> 16:56.233
(cheering)

17:02.167 --> 17:06.067
I'm having the best time.
Marnie's back, Aaron's back.

17:06.133 --> 17:08.567
And the family is complete.

17:11.367 --> 17:14.099
I cannot stay angry
at this boy forever.

17:14.166 --> 17:18.200
Cos I do really, really like him
and I can't help it.

17:18.267 --> 17:20.733
By the looks of things,
Chloe has forgiven Sam.

17:20.800 --> 17:23.433
That was pretty quick.
I need a word.

17:30.233 --> 17:33.800
I'm glad Sam has spoke to Chloe
and he's apologised.

17:33.867 --> 17:36.133
He's actually admitted
he was in the wrong.

17:41.533 --> 17:44.500
Sophie's right. I need to be
happy
and Sam makes us happy.

17:44.567 --> 17:48.600
I can't be angry forever, so
I'll
let him have a kiss if he's
lucky.

17:57.433 --> 18:00.933
Since Marnie's been back
I can't get a word in with Aaron

18:01.000 --> 18:04.033
cos she's been all over him.
It's such a weird friendship.

18:07.500 --> 18:11.067
I'm drunk, needy
and I want a cuddle.

18:11.133 --> 18:14.300
My boyfriend's not here.
Does that really matter?

18:17.067 --> 18:19.033
Maaron are playing a dangerous
game.

18:19.100 --> 18:21.733
They say they're friends,
but when they're pissed

18:21.800 --> 18:24.333
they're all over each other.

18:27.900 --> 18:31.600
Whilst Chloe's busy getting
reacquainted with Marnie's
minge,

18:31.667 --> 18:35.500
I need to talk to Sam to make
sure
he knows not to hurt Chloe
again.

18:48.367 --> 18:52.533
I've got to take Sophie's
advice.
I like Chloe too much to fuck
up.

18:52.600 --> 18:55.133
I need to be
on my best behaviour from now
on.

19:00.500 --> 19:04.633
Lucky escape? I think I've had
the lucky escape, you pisshead.

19:06.667 --> 19:11.367
Fucking hell, Abbie. I've not
seen
you drop that quick since
Tenerife.

19:14.033 --> 19:16.467
I think I might have
got away with that one.

19:16.533 --> 19:18.700
If in doubt, dance it out.

19:26.400 --> 19:29.500
It's my first night back
and I'm having a wicked night.

19:29.567 --> 19:32.100
After what Sophie told us
about Steph and Aaron,

19:32.167 --> 19:34.000
I wanna see what Aaron's gotta
say.

19:44.100 --> 19:47.600
What the fuck is Marnie going on
about? Me and Steph are just
mates,

19:47.667 --> 19:51.733
me and Marnie are just mates,
everyone's just mates, chill
out.

19:57.000 --> 20:00.700
I may be drunk, but Steph needs
to be honest about what she
wants.

20:00.767 --> 20:04.600
I think it's a bit disrespectful
of mine and Aaron's
relationship.

20:07.967 --> 20:11.000
Marnie's wasted and has no idea
what she's talking about.

20:11.067 --> 20:13.233
She is gonna regret this
in the morning.

20:13.300 --> 20:16.500
It's a good job I love that
radgie.

20:18.500 --> 20:21.900
Fuck, I've just got
a boner over Sophie.

20:21.967 --> 20:23.967
This is disgusting.

20:29.000 --> 20:32.833
Me and Chloe are having fun and
it
feels like we're back to normal.

20:32.900 --> 20:34.900
This night could not
be going better.

20:39.500 --> 20:42.233
It makes us feel good
that Sam has missed us.

20:42.300 --> 20:44.067
Cos I've missed him too.

20:49.400 --> 20:53.467
Little by little Chloe
will start trusting me, I hope.

20:58.733 --> 21:03.867
Even though I am 100% sober, I
can't
wait to have make-up sex with
Sam,

21:03.933 --> 21:06.567
cos that is always the best.

21:08.367 --> 21:11.367
I haven't been this mortal
in a long time.

21:11.433 --> 21:14.300
So, I'm gonna have a nap
and charge my batteries.

21:15.800 --> 21:18.667
Thank God I'm on a drinking ban
and can help Abbie.

21:18.733 --> 21:21.500
But if you fall asleep in a
club,
you're fair game.

21:28.967 --> 21:31.267
Tonight has been amazing.

21:31.333 --> 21:35.533
But unfortunately, like all good
things have to come to an end,

21:35.600 --> 21:38.000
it's time to go back
to the fucking wigwams.

21:44.133 --> 21:46.033
Come on, bitches!

21:46.100 --> 21:47.733
Why are my pants undone?

21:47.800 --> 21:48.833
Where's the cabin?

21:48.900 --> 21:51.800
I am absolutely mortal drunk.
I can't even see.

21:51.867 --> 21:55.633
I can't be arsed with anyone.
I'm just gonna put myself to
bed.

21:57.400 --> 21:58.467
I wanna piss.

21:58.533 --> 22:02.700
I'm drunk, cold
and need a fucking piss.

22:02.767 --> 22:06.433
The world is my toilet right
now.
Fuck you, Anna.

22:06.500 --> 22:08.200
And fuck your wigwams.

22:08.267 --> 22:09.467
I will piss on you.

22:14.000 --> 22:16.933
We get back to the wigwams,
it's cold, I'm starving,

22:17.000 --> 22:20.667
but who gives a fuck,
cos I'm sharing my bed with Sam.

22:34.167 --> 22:36.300
Aaron, get out!

22:36.367 --> 22:41.400
No matter where we are in the
world,
Aaron wants to be close to
Marnie.

22:41.467 --> 22:44.100
Aaron! Get out now!

22:44.167 --> 22:49.167
I'm trying to put Marnie to bed
and I fell asleep cos I'm
mortal.

22:49.233 --> 22:50.800
Fuck's sake.

22:50.867 --> 22:53.367
I'm gonna be sick here.
No, not on the bed.

23:00.700 --> 23:03.600
(speaks nonsense)
Aaron!

23:03.667 --> 23:05.367
What?!
Go to sleep!

23:05.433 --> 23:07.767
I've always wanted to
share a bed with Aaron,

23:07.833 --> 23:10.600
but unfortunately tonight
he won't shut up!

23:10.667 --> 23:12.667
All I want to do is go to sleep.

23:12.733 --> 23:13.967
So annoying!

23:16.167 --> 23:18.433
Just go to sleep!

23:18.500 --> 23:20.600
Put your chicken burger down.
Lie down.

23:27.267 --> 23:31.633
I've never shagged in a wigwam
before, so tonight I'm excited.

23:35.033 --> 23:39.733
I'm gonna make sure Sam
never fucks up ever again.

23:42.700 --> 23:45.667
I dunno if there's something
in the weather in Scotland,

23:45.733 --> 23:48.500
but I'm lasting ages here,
it's well over a minute.

23:56.267 --> 23:58.300
Abbie looks like
a badger's asshole.

23:58.367 --> 24:01.200
Size of his balls, man!
Fuck me!

24:01.267 --> 24:03.767
I find it weird watching you
two.
Do you?

24:03.833 --> 24:06.733
I think Steph is jealous
of my friendship with Aaron.

24:06.800 --> 24:10.433
My first night back in the Toon.
(cheering)

24:11.433 --> 24:13.733
(all) Geordie Shore, why aye!

24:15.467 --> 24:15.667
.

24:18.167 --> 24:18.367
.

24:24.100 --> 24:26.233
(animal noises)

24:32.767 --> 24:34.400
Morning!

24:34.467 --> 24:37.733
How funny is it,
being in the same room together?

24:37.800 --> 24:40.200
Last night could have went
one of two ways.

24:40.267 --> 24:44.000
But finally Sam admitted the
truth
and that's all I wanted.

24:44.067 --> 24:45.567
Don't do it again, Sam.

24:45.633 --> 24:49.567
I don't want to kick off, but
when
someone's doing that, I'm going
to.

24:49.633 --> 24:51.067
Best behaviour from now on.

24:51.133 --> 24:53.667
Good, cos you're not
getting any more chances.

24:53.733 --> 24:57.100
I feel like last night,
me and Chloe both matured
together.

24:57.167 --> 24:58.533
We're like cheese.

24:58.600 --> 25:00.833
I am happy right now, baby.

25:00.900 --> 25:03.000
Goodnight.
It's morning.

25:06.400 --> 25:09.367
Marnie, I promise you now,

25:09.433 --> 25:12.067
I haven't had
a fucking wink of sleep.

25:12.133 --> 25:14.867
I've woke up, I feel minging
and I feel damp.

25:14.933 --> 25:16.400
But not in a good way.

25:16.467 --> 25:19.700
Aaron was lying in this bed,
like this again.

25:19.767 --> 25:22.267
Aaron needs to know
that best friends,

25:22.333 --> 25:24.633
when it's a boy and girl
who used to date,

25:24.700 --> 25:28.433
can't really sleep in the same
bed.
That's pushing the boundaries.

25:28.500 --> 25:30.700
Chloe and Sam made up last
night.

25:30.767 --> 25:34.433
Do you think he's different
to all the other lads?

25:34.500 --> 25:36.867
Yeah, I do.

25:36.933 --> 25:41.700
I don't think he's got
that, like... that streak in
him.

25:41.767 --> 25:45.333
I hope for Chloe's sake Marnie
is right and Sam is different

25:45.400 --> 25:47.567
cos she deserves to be happy.

25:47.633 --> 25:49.733
I can't believe
on your first night back

25:49.800 --> 25:52.900
we've come to Edinburgh
and you've slept in a wigwam.

25:52.967 --> 25:54.900
Eh, God.

25:56.433 --> 25:59.867
Oh, my God, I feel like I've
chosen
the worst person to sleep with.

25:59.933 --> 26:01.700
What you telling me? You loved
it.

26:01.767 --> 26:04.133
I've always wanted
to share a bed with Aaron.

26:04.200 --> 26:08.533
Last night I massively regretted
it.
The lad wouldn't shut up.

26:09.600 --> 26:13.700
Everyone was fucked last night.
You were fucked, Marnie was
fucked.

26:13.767 --> 26:18.133
Abbie was fucked. Good job
Sophie
kicked you out of Marnie's bed.

26:18.200 --> 26:20.533
Could have been a lot worse.

26:20.600 --> 26:24.167
I woke up cuddling Nathan, but
Sophie done me a favour last
night,

26:24.233 --> 26:28.100
cos I coulda woken up with
Marnie.
That would have been awkward.

26:28.167 --> 26:30.367
I've really,
really enjoyed Edinburgh.

26:30.433 --> 26:33.700
I feel sorry for Abbie and
Steph.
They wanna brush their teeth.

26:33.767 --> 26:35.933
Disco cock.
Disco cock. (laughs)

26:39.567 --> 26:43.000
How creased were you last night?
(laughs)

26:43.067 --> 26:46.167
I reckon you're gonna get
a naughty hangover today.

26:46.233 --> 26:50.567
Do you know what it is? I feel
like
Scottish alcohol fucked me up.

26:50.633 --> 26:53.133
I don't know if it was
the Scottish alcohol.

26:53.200 --> 26:56.967
It was the amount you were
drinking
to forget about that haggis.

26:57.033 --> 26:59.300
Marnie was with Aaron all night.

26:59.367 --> 27:03.000
Was she?
Yeah. Their relationship is mad.

27:03.067 --> 27:05.467
Stop worrying
about their relationship.

27:05.533 --> 27:09.300
Aaron is still your mate
and that's all that matters.

27:09.367 --> 27:12.967
I'm a little worried
she's still got feelings for
Aaron.

27:13.033 --> 27:14.600
Hank Marvin!

27:20.100 --> 27:23.100
I think we should look at this
farm.
Come on, then.

27:23.167 --> 27:25.333
Country air is good for a
hangover.

27:25.400 --> 27:28.833
We thought we'd explore and see
what the noises were last night.

27:28.900 --> 27:30.767
They can't have been Sam and
Chloe.

27:30.833 --> 27:32.567
(mimics animals)

27:32.633 --> 27:34.567
I'd love to be woken
to cock every day.

27:36.733 --> 27:39.033
She was on a different planet
last night.

27:39.100 --> 27:42.133
Fucking hell, Abbie looks worse
than a badger's asshole.

27:42.200 --> 27:44.667
Not even Gok Wan could sort her
out.

27:48.333 --> 27:51.133
Size of his balls, man!
Fuck me.

27:51.200 --> 27:54.933
Thank fuck Abbie and Steph
didn't
have to face balls that big

27:55.000 --> 27:56.167
at work last night.

27:56.233 --> 27:59.467
Last night was funny.
You were funny last night.

27:59.533 --> 28:00.967
You know what was funnier?

28:01.033 --> 28:05.367
Walking in to my wigwam and
finding
you on the end of the bed.

28:05.433 --> 28:08.833
Aaron was mortal last night
and doesn't need the fear.

28:08.900 --> 28:11.800
He was fully dressed
and at the end of Marnie's bed.

28:11.867 --> 28:14.200
Do you remember
what you said last night?

28:14.267 --> 28:17.500
What?
You went, "Steph wants to fuck
you."

28:17.567 --> 28:21.233
(gasps) Bitch, burn!

28:21.300 --> 28:23.533
Yes, Aaron,
I can remember what I said.

28:23.600 --> 28:25.433
And, yes, it's very
embarrassing.

28:25.500 --> 28:28.533
Yes, I was very drunk
and didn't know what I was
saying.

28:28.600 --> 28:32.533
I actually like Steph. Yous said
she's cracking on with Aaron.

28:32.600 --> 28:35.133
Why aye, she fancies you,
doesn't she?

28:35.200 --> 28:36.667
I didn't notice, though.

28:36.733 --> 28:38.467
Sophie's overthinking it.

28:38.533 --> 28:41.633
Just cos she talks to us,
doesn't mean she wants to shag
us.

28:41.700 --> 28:45.800
I don't know why I got so
bitchy,
but I do like the girl.

28:45.867 --> 28:50.200
Edinburgh has been amazing,
but there is no place like home.

28:50.267 --> 28:52.300
So, let's get back to Newcastle.

28:58.067 --> 29:00.233
Back on it like a car bonnet!

29:00.300 --> 29:02.500
First I thought
these wigwams were shit,

29:02.567 --> 29:04.700
but you know what? They're cosy.

29:04.767 --> 29:07.367
Maybe me and Sam can come here
on our honeymoon.

29:07.433 --> 29:08.600
Back to the Toon.

29:08.667 --> 29:11.267
Who's farted?
Who... (gags)

29:19.500 --> 29:23.700
Nothing says home sweet home
like breathing in the Newcastle
air.

29:23.767 --> 29:26.333
I am buzzing to be back.

29:26.400 --> 29:30.467
Clean, warm, amazing.

29:30.533 --> 29:32.533
I'm so glad to be back in
Newcastle.

29:32.600 --> 29:36.000
Last night was fun, but this
is my first night back in the
Toon.

29:36.067 --> 29:37.233
It's gonna get messy.

29:45.667 --> 29:49.000
It's my first night
so I'm really excited.

29:49.067 --> 29:50.400
I wanna get really drunk.

29:50.467 --> 29:54.100
I feel like I'm gonna get drunk,
but not half as drunk as last
night.

29:54.167 --> 29:55.800
I wanna stay awake.
Go on, man.

29:55.867 --> 29:59.500
I'm gonna, but I wanna stay
awake
for the night out this time.

29:59.567 --> 30:03.100
It's easy enough for me to say
I'm
not gonna get that drunk
tonight,

30:03.167 --> 30:04.867
but who am I kidding?

30:04.933 --> 30:08.233
Steph, I feel like you've been
on good behaviour.

30:08.300 --> 30:09.967
I have, haven't I?

30:10.033 --> 30:12.000
I don't know, like.

30:12.067 --> 30:15.400
I think since Marnie's came back
I've felt a bit left out.

30:15.467 --> 30:18.600
But I'm gonna put that aside
and party with the family.

30:18.667 --> 30:21.500
I'm gonna go on a wild one
tonight
with yous, I need it.

30:21.567 --> 30:23.833
You know what?
I'm gonna be on Aaron watch.

30:23.900 --> 30:26.300
Really?
Marnie's really naive.

30:26.367 --> 30:30.267
But even I can see Aaron
still does flirt with her.

30:30.333 --> 30:32.433
I find it weird
watching yous two, like.

30:32.500 --> 30:35.933
Do you? I think me and Aaron
have always had this weird
thing.

30:36.033 --> 30:38.700
I wish I had a connection
like that with someone.

30:38.767 --> 30:42.500
I like Steph, but I think she's
jealous of my friendship with
Aaron.

30:42.567 --> 30:45.967
She needs to understand it's
taken
a long time to get where we are.

30:46.033 --> 30:50.133
I think you being off the drink,
Chloe, has done you a favour.

30:50.200 --> 30:53.833
I can't believe I can say Anna
has finally done me a favour.

30:53.900 --> 30:56.100
Being sober might have worked
last night,

30:56.167 --> 30:58.833
but with Marnie back,
me and Sam back together,

30:58.900 --> 31:02.667
I am definitely getting on
the peev tonight, like. Woo-hoo!

31:02.733 --> 31:05.533
I can say to my grandkids
I've christened a wigwam.

31:08.600 --> 31:11.967
Sam, how did you manage to pull
it
round so quickly last night?

31:12.033 --> 31:15.967
All I did was be honest. That's
the first time I've done that.

31:16.033 --> 31:20.233
I said, in the end, I just
said sorry. I won't do it again.

31:20.300 --> 31:24.400
If there's anything I've
learned,
honesty is the best policy.

31:24.467 --> 31:26.833
Tonight I am on best behaviour.

31:26.900 --> 31:28.233
Good man.
Simple as that.

31:28.300 --> 31:31.067
At the end of the day,
you've admitted you were wrong.

31:31.133 --> 31:34.133
All you can do now is move
forward
and don't do it again.

31:34.200 --> 31:37.800
Aaron, I think tonight
you need to stay in your own
bed,

31:37.867 --> 31:41.033
stay in this room with us
and stay away from Marnie
Simpson.

31:41.100 --> 31:45.633
Nathan, that is music to my
ears.
I am 100% staying in the boys
room.

31:45.700 --> 31:48.600
I might stay in your bed. I
might.
Nah.

31:48.667 --> 31:49.900
You want us in the room.

31:49.967 --> 31:52.467
I wanted to share a bed,
but not after last night.

31:52.533 --> 31:55.600
If you want me to stay in this
room,
I'll sleep in that bed.

31:55.667 --> 31:57.200
(laughs)

31:59.767 --> 32:02.833
Girls!
Right, come on.

32:02.900 --> 32:06.000
Edinburgh was amazing,
but there's no place like the
Toon.

32:06.067 --> 32:08.900
Tonight I am going to get
fucking hammered.

32:08.967 --> 32:11.433
This is my first night back
in the Toon.

32:11.500 --> 32:13.900
I want a really good night,
no drama.

32:13.967 --> 32:15.767
(cheering)

32:15.833 --> 32:18.567
It's Marnie's first night
back in Newcastle,

32:18.633 --> 32:21.167
so let's get to Tup Tup
and have a wicked night.

32:25.833 --> 32:26.967
Go!

32:27.033 --> 32:29.367
One, two, three.
(both) Eight!

32:29.433 --> 32:32.900
That is fate. We are going to
get
married and have kids tomorrow.

32:32.967 --> 32:35.333
That girl has got pissed again.

32:37.267 --> 32:39.933
Don't fucking dare
bring my boyfriend into it.

32:40.000 --> 32:42.667
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

32:44.933 --> 32:45.133
.

32:47.633 --> 32:47.833
.

32:57.900 --> 32:59.467
Howay, girls.

33:05.000 --> 33:08.300
We have hit the ground running
in Tup Tup.

33:08.367 --> 33:11.033
We've got straight in there,
straight on the drink

33:11.100 --> 33:13.100
and everyone is dancing.

33:18.000 --> 33:19.433
(cheering)

33:39.033 --> 33:42.600
Chloe needs to stop worrying.
I've got a good feeling about
Sam.

33:42.667 --> 33:44.667
I really think he's different.

33:51.867 --> 33:54.567
Fighting with Sam made me worry
he wasn't a good lad.

33:54.633 --> 33:56.600
It's nice that Marnie thinks he
is.

33:56.667 --> 34:00.100
I want us to move forward
cos I really like him.

34:06.300 --> 34:08.867
The club is bouncing
and we're all on the shots.

34:08.933 --> 34:12.033
I've got a feeling it's gonna be
another messy one.

34:16.067 --> 34:19.699
To have Marnie and Aaron back
has made my night even better.

34:19.766 --> 34:21.300
Usually I'm by myself,

34:21.367 --> 34:24.867
but now I've got them two,
it means we're back in business.

34:34.567 --> 34:37.833
(laughs) Sophie, you haven't got
anything to worry about.

34:37.900 --> 34:40.800
I respect her relationship,
she respects mine.

34:40.867 --> 34:43.467
We're just friends
and nothing will change that.

34:52.300 --> 34:55.433
It's amazing how mature
Aaron has turned out to be.

34:55.500 --> 34:57.667
How much he treasures
our friendship.

35:03.067 --> 35:06.633
Even though Marnie and Aaron
did give it a try so many times,

35:06.700 --> 35:08.600
they do work better as friends.

35:08.667 --> 35:11.667
I'm just gutted they'll never be
in a relationship.

35:27.733 --> 35:30.633
I went through so much shit
with Marty and I hated it.

35:30.700 --> 35:32.733
Now Sam has brought
the old Chloe back.

35:45.867 --> 35:50.367
I never in a million years
thought
I'd go on double dates with
Nathan.

35:50.433 --> 35:53.667
Nathan is my best friend
and I can't wait to get out of
here.

36:01.500 --> 36:04.833
Seeing these two so happy
makes me miss my boyfriend.

36:04.900 --> 36:08.300
And although I'm out with my
family,
I feel very lonely.

36:08.367 --> 36:10.833
Fuck it, get me another drink.

36:15.033 --> 36:19.133
I'm having a mint night, but I
need
to clear the air with Marnie.

36:19.200 --> 36:21.433
We need to have a chat about
Aaron.

36:36.667 --> 36:39.833
If I wanted to fuck Aaron,
I would have done it by now

36:39.900 --> 36:43.467
regardless of Marnie.
It must clearly still bother
her.

36:53.133 --> 36:55.167
I mean it when I say I like
Steph.

36:55.233 --> 36:56.800
I wanna keep an eye on her.

36:56.867 --> 36:59.867
Aaron is my best friend
and I don't want her to ruin
that.

37:08.200 --> 37:11.633
I thought after last night,
Abbie might not drink again.

37:11.700 --> 37:15.633
But fuck me, that girl
has got pissed again.

37:18.133 --> 37:22.400
How have I done this again? I
don't
understand how I'm this drunk.

37:35.367 --> 37:38.033
I think any more liquid
is the last thing I need.

37:38.100 --> 37:39.933
I am desperate for a piss.

37:40.000 --> 37:41.900
Ooh, too late.

37:49.667 --> 37:52.567
Me and Sam literally
can't stay away from each other.

37:52.633 --> 37:54.900
I just hope people
don't get sick of wuh.

38:04.833 --> 38:07.167
What fuck?
As if that has just happened.

38:07.233 --> 38:08.233
That is fate.

38:08.300 --> 38:12.300
We are going to get married and
have
kids tomorrow. I can't believe
that.

38:20.933 --> 38:24.333
Did I just drop the L bomb?
Oh, my God.

38:27.167 --> 38:29.967
Cheeky bastard
can't even say it back.

38:30.033 --> 38:31.367
I'm so embarrassed.

38:33.900 --> 38:36.633
Chloe telling me
she loves me is a big statement,

38:36.700 --> 38:38.800
but to be fair
it is going that way.

38:38.867 --> 38:42.233
I don't want to lie to Chloe
and tell her I love her before I
do.

38:42.300 --> 38:45.167
When the time is right
I'll then tell her.

38:50.967 --> 38:52.200
Abbie, let's go!

38:52.267 --> 38:55.633
What a night!
Everyone is absolutely mortal.

38:55.700 --> 38:58.600
Now it's time for us radgies
to get back home.

39:02.100 --> 39:04.833
We're all mortal and that means
wind up Nathan time.

39:04.900 --> 39:08.333
I'm playing with fire,
but sometimes it's good to get
burnt.

39:08.400 --> 39:11.900
Excuse me, I think
you're all very fucking rude!

39:14.233 --> 39:15.467
(laughter)

39:17.300 --> 39:19.633
I overheard you, cos I'm not
deaf.

39:19.700 --> 39:22.067
Aaron and Nathan
are winding each other up,

39:22.133 --> 39:25.967
and it's only a matter of time
before one of them bites.

39:28.200 --> 39:30.667
Aaron and Marnie
have turned on us in the taxi.

39:30.733 --> 39:34.100
It was funny at first, but now
it's just getting personal.

39:34.167 --> 39:37.000
Fuck all of yous.
I actually hate them all.

39:37.067 --> 39:39.833
The thing is, he can dish it
out,
but can't take it.

39:39.900 --> 39:42.000
He's starting to get really
angry.

39:42.067 --> 39:44.800
I've got a good idea,
let's poke the bear.

39:48.333 --> 39:49.367
Oh, my God!

39:49.433 --> 39:52.033
I'm all for taking the piss
in this house,

39:52.100 --> 39:54.733
but don't fucking dare
bring my boyfriend into it.

39:54.800 --> 39:56.233
I'd never do that to you.

39:56.300 --> 40:01.700
Why would you bring something
so sensitive to me up like that?

40:01.767 --> 40:04.667
Marnie's tipped Nathan over the
edge
and he's lost it.

40:04.733 --> 40:06.767
I can't help but find it
fucking funny.

40:06.833 --> 40:09.833
You wound me up and this is
what you fucking wanted.

40:09.900 --> 40:12.533
You've got what you fucking
wanted.

40:23.267 --> 40:25.800
I can't be fucked with this
or their immaturity.

40:25.867 --> 40:27.867
I'm going straight to bed.

40:29.467 --> 40:31.033
Wow, look at the cheesy chips.

40:31.100 --> 40:34.167
I know I should go upstairs
and check if Nathan's all right,

40:34.233 --> 40:37.933
but have you seen how beautiful
these cheesy chips are?

40:39.500 --> 40:42.700
Sam, I'm so happy Chloe's found
someone who treats her right.

40:49.633 --> 40:53.067
Seeing Chloe so happy after what
she's been through in this house

40:53.133 --> 40:54.567
is always going to be nice.

40:54.633 --> 40:58.000
I hope Sam can keep it up
and doesn't turn into an
asshole.

40:58.067 --> 41:00.933
I'm gonna be in love
before I leave this house.

41:01.000 --> 41:04.700
What is wrong with me? Dropping
the L bomb like nobody's
business.

41:04.767 --> 41:07.900
Are you, Sam?
If it keeps going at this rate,
yeah.

41:07.967 --> 41:09.233
Yes!

41:09.300 --> 41:13.933
Finally, Sam has admitted he
could
leave the house in love with me.

41:14.000 --> 41:15.500
That's all I ever wanted.

41:15.567 --> 41:19.067
I've not been in the house where
I've been this happy in my life.

41:19.133 --> 41:22.067
Aww. Coming back to the house
has been amazing.

41:22.133 --> 41:23.467
Seeing how happy Chloe is

41:23.533 --> 41:25.833
has reminded us
how much I love this family.

41:25.900 --> 41:26.900
I'm going to bed.

41:26.967 --> 41:30.667
Tonight has been unreal, but I'm
not
gonna remember in the morning.

41:30.733 --> 41:32.867
All I wanna do is go to bed.

41:32.933 --> 41:35.000
(burps)
(laughter)

41:35.067 --> 41:37.667
Before I start telling
everyone else I love them,

41:37.733 --> 41:38.767
I'm going to bed.

41:43.633 --> 41:47.600
Tonight really upset us.
I can't keep this in any longer.

41:47.667 --> 41:49.233
I need to talk to Marnie.

41:49.300 --> 41:54.000
What I think you said
is inappropriate and
insensitive.

41:54.067 --> 41:55.833
You've actually really upset us.

41:55.900 --> 41:58.167
Calm down,
we were only winding you up.

41:58.233 --> 42:00.567
It's a little crack,
you normally like that.

42:00.633 --> 42:02.100
I don't give a fuck.

42:02.167 --> 42:06.133
As a friend, you would never
have brought that up. Fuck off.

42:06.200 --> 42:07.800
Fuck off, everyone.

42:09.800 --> 42:11.000
Fuck off.

42:11.067 --> 42:14.067
Since Maaron have come back,
they've been inseparable.

42:14.133 --> 42:18.300
Have I mentioned how their
partners
feel? No. That's crossing the
line.

42:18.367 --> 42:20.167
Just like they have tonight.

42:20.233 --> 42:23.100
(laughter)
I'm glad you're laughing!

42:26.467 --> 42:29.233
Calm down, Nathan,
we were only having a laugh.

42:32.467 --> 42:34.000
You are.

42:34.067 --> 42:37.067
I want an apology
and Marnie's not gonna give me
it.

42:37.133 --> 42:40.133
I guess she's not as good a
friend
as I thought she was.

42:49.900 --> 42:53.233
There's nothing better to see
than when Chloe's this happy.

42:56.467 --> 43:01.233
If this is what saying I love
you
gets, I need to say it more
often.

43:11.133 --> 43:12.900
Breath smells pure lush.

43:12.967 --> 43:14.333
Fanny is shaved.

43:14.400 --> 43:16.500
Now fuck off out my barbers.

43:20.300 --> 43:22.067
I'll forgive, but never forget.

43:22.133 --> 43:25.133
Do you wanna see how much
you trust each other?

43:25.200 --> 43:26.933
(laughter)

43:27.000 --> 43:28.767
Shame! Shame!

43:28.833 --> 43:30.600
I am not a bad person!

43:30.667 --> 43:32.867
I will never smash anything
again!

43:32.933 --> 43:35.100
I want to fall in love,
but I'm scared.

43:39.633 --> 43:42.300
That's what I thought
Abbie had told us.

43:43.567 --> 43:46.300
What the fuck?
Take a picture of my asshole.

43:46.367 --> 43:47.700
We're not well.

44:13.433 --> 44:13.633
.
