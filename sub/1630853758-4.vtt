WEBVTT

00:07.007 --> 00:08.800
You don't need to stress, all right?

00:08.884 --> 00:10.802
It's nothing to worry about.
It's just a catch-up.

00:10.886 --> 00:12.179
Jase, he doesn't like us.

00:12.262 --> 00:14.097
How could you not like us? We're adorable.

00:14.181 --> 00:16.015
I can read the notes he makes.

00:16.099 --> 00:19.520
You don't spend six months in therapy
without learning how to read upside down.

00:20.229 --> 00:21.480
What if he tells the judge
we're not up to it?

00:21.563 --> 00:22.689
That's not gonna happen.

00:22.773 --> 00:25.234
Well, we need to prove
how much we know these kids.

00:25.317 --> 00:28.153
-Right. Birthdays, go.
-Okay, birthday.

00:28.237 --> 00:30.280
So Princess is the…

00:31.031 --> 00:32.824
-4th of March 2011…
-Good.

00:32.908 --> 00:35.410
-…and Tyler is the…
-Go on.

00:35.494 --> 00:39.456
…14th of November 2014.

00:39.540 --> 00:41.458
-Very, very good. Right--
-There you go. Heights?

00:41.542 --> 00:44.211
-We don't need to know their heights.
-Okay, how tall am I?

00:44.294 --> 00:45.671
-5'3''. Why?
-Yes, exactly.

00:45.754 --> 00:47.631
You always know
how tall the people you love are.

00:47.714 --> 00:50.342
-She, I'm gonna write this down, is 4'7".
-All right. Yeah. Seven.

00:50.425 --> 00:52.761
-Yep. And he's 4'1".
-4'1".

00:52.845 --> 00:55.347
What about best friends?
Let's go Tyler's best friend.

00:55.430 --> 00:56.765
-Hassan?
-No, they've drifted.

00:56.849 --> 00:58.141
-What? Again?
-I know.

00:59.810 --> 01:01.979
It'll be all right. Take a deep breath.

01:03.146 --> 01:04.147
All right.

01:04.857 --> 01:06.024
Let's do it.

01:28.547 --> 01:29.590
What's the matter?

01:29.673 --> 01:31.425
-I'm nervous.
-Why?

01:31.508 --> 01:33.177
I always say the wrong thing
in front of him.

01:33.260 --> 01:34.386
You're gonna be fine, okay?

01:35.220 --> 01:36.305
Here we go.

01:36.388 --> 01:38.891
Sorry I'm late. Slight family emergency.

01:38.974 --> 01:41.310
I'm afraid my grandmother died, so…

01:41.393 --> 01:42.769
Oh, God, is she okay?

01:45.230 --> 01:46.732
-No, she--
-Sorry, no, obviously not.

01:46.815 --> 01:48.609
So, nice to see you.

01:48.692 --> 01:50.736
-Nice to see you as well.
-How are we?

01:50.819 --> 01:53.280
-Good. Really good actually.
-Great, yeah. Really good.

01:53.363 --> 01:55.032
-How've things been with the children?
-Great.

01:55.115 --> 01:57.034
We adore them both, don't we?

01:57.117 --> 02:00.913
I mean, Princess is a…
4'7" ball of energy.

02:00.996 --> 02:01.997
Don't do that.

02:02.080 --> 02:04.291
And Tyler and Jason have bonded
over being Spurs fans.

02:04.374 --> 02:05.501
Oh, yeah, yeah.

02:05.584 --> 02:07.294
'Cause I know what it's like
to lose things too.

02:07.377 --> 02:08.628
Being a Spurs fan.

02:09.630 --> 02:11.048
I'm just having a joke.

02:12.299 --> 02:13.300
I like jokes.

02:13.383 --> 02:15.177
Good, good.

02:17.513 --> 02:20.599
So, are we permanently
with you now, Noah?

02:20.682 --> 02:23.185
-We definitely don't go back to Penny?
-Sorry to disappoint.

02:23.268 --> 02:26.271
-No. No. God, no.
-No, it's not a disappointment.

02:26.355 --> 02:28.315
It's just we built up
a lovely relationship with her.

02:28.398 --> 02:29.942
-And we were wondering--
-Yeah.

02:30.025 --> 02:32.402
I feel certain
we can recreate the chemistry.

02:32.486 --> 02:33.737
-Yeah, definitely.
-Yes.

02:33.820 --> 02:35.280
Anyway, she's been promoted.

02:35.864 --> 02:36.949
Heaven knows to what.

02:37.032 --> 02:38.742
Queen and Head
of the Commonwealth, knowing her.

02:38.825 --> 02:40.911
-See, you do like a joke.
-Probably.

02:40.994 --> 02:43.789
Tell me more about Tyler.
Do we still have the lamp?

02:43.872 --> 02:46.542
-Yes, Adam, yeah.
-Yes. Yes, he's become a friend now.

02:46.625 --> 02:49.253
-Like family.
-He finds it hard making human ones.

02:50.420 --> 02:52.756
He has some, but they--
they come and go, don't they?

02:52.840 --> 02:53.799
Classic Scorpio.

02:53.882 --> 02:56.510
'Cause his birthday's
the 14th of November 2014.

02:56.593 --> 02:57.594
Okay.

02:57.678 --> 03:00.180
For someone like Tyler,
who's experienced loss,

03:00.264 --> 03:02.266
young friendships are full of danger.

03:02.349 --> 03:05.769
He's looking for people that aren't
going anywhere, that he can rely on.

03:05.853 --> 03:07.104
Like a lamp.

03:09.690 --> 03:10.983
Well, he can rely on us.

03:12.150 --> 03:13.527
Good, good…

03:13.610 --> 03:14.611
Birthday coming up then?

03:14.695 --> 03:16.697
-Yeah, right. Coming up quick.
-Yeah, party tomorrow.

03:17.406 --> 03:18.824
Lovely. Do we have a good turnout?

03:18.907 --> 03:20.826
-I'm not sure.
-You asked for RSVPs though?

03:23.120 --> 03:25.581
-Yes, I didn't, did you? Maybe.
-I don't know--

03:25.664 --> 03:26.832
Okay, look.

03:28.250 --> 03:30.210
He needs your help now

03:30.294 --> 03:32.963
to learn the skills
that he's going to need

03:33.046 --> 03:34.756
for building relationships as an adult.

03:34.840 --> 03:37.509
-Okay.
-He looks to you. Be role models.

03:37.593 --> 03:40.554
Okay, if he's struggling to make friends,
show him how.

03:40.637 --> 03:43.056
We will.

03:43.640 --> 03:44.933
We'll be great role models, won't we?

03:45.017 --> 03:46.018
Yeah.

03:49.938 --> 03:50.939
Sorry, sorry.

03:51.023 --> 03:52.691
I thought that was on silent.

03:55.527 --> 03:57.613
It doesn't seem to be
in my coat. It's ringing.

03:58.113 --> 03:59.823
I have so many pockets in this coat.

03:59.907 --> 04:01.200
Here it is. Lovely.

04:02.784 --> 04:04.995
Didn't even know I had this pocket.
Here it is.

04:08.165 --> 04:10.667
Do you think we should've told him
that they're selling the flat?

04:10.751 --> 04:12.044
No, why?

04:12.127 --> 04:13.962
We can just tell them
once we've bought it.

04:14.046 --> 04:15.464
Yeah, definitely. Definitely.

04:16.882 --> 04:18.175
This is a bit--

04:18.257 --> 04:19.635
bit too much stuff maybe?

04:20.385 --> 04:21.553
No.

04:21.637 --> 04:24.264
He needs help making friends.

04:24.348 --> 04:26.683
And good parties make you popular.

04:26.767 --> 04:28.227
-What's the theme, by the way?
-Right.

04:28.310 --> 04:32.981
Key words are repairing the past
and forging friendships that can endure.

04:33.065 --> 04:35.984
Right, I was thinking more safari
or dinosaurs or something, but okay.

04:36.068 --> 04:38.320
Did you get Princess a present
so she doesn't feel left out?

04:38.403 --> 04:41.031
She keeps saying
that she wants a tattoo, so--

04:41.657 --> 04:43.367
So I got her one of those
little henna ones.

04:43.450 --> 04:45.577
Okay, well, I mean,
that's a gateway tattoo.

04:46.662 --> 04:49.456
Right. We need to be role models.

04:50.040 --> 04:52.084
We need to make friends
with some parents from school.

04:52.167 --> 04:53.418
We've not engaged enough.

04:53.502 --> 04:55.087
I don't wanna meet any more parents.

04:55.170 --> 04:57.923
Other people are the worst,
especially parents.

04:58.006 --> 05:02.010
I know you don't like it,
but how else are you gonna meet people?

05:05.055 --> 05:07.182
-What?
-There's someone in the flat.

05:09.476 --> 05:10.853
Jase, what do we do?

05:15.566 --> 05:17.693
Jase, get back! Jase, Jason!

05:17.776 --> 05:18.777
It's fine.

05:30.831 --> 05:32.916
Just showing some people around the flat.

05:35.460 --> 05:36.461
All right.

05:38.297 --> 05:41.300
I mean, it needs a bit of love,
but, you know, original features.

05:41.383 --> 05:42.509
Good bones.

05:43.302 --> 05:45.012
Don't kick that. Sounds hollow.

05:50.225 --> 05:51.977
-Why are they showing people around?
-I don't know.

05:52.060 --> 05:54.855
-Do they not know we want to buy it?
-Yeah, he knows we're gonna do that.

05:54.938 --> 05:56.315
-Has the money come through?
-Yes.

05:56.398 --> 05:57.983
I mean,
I need to call my dad to make sure.

05:58.066 --> 05:59.902
-Let's just go tell him.
-No, no. I'll talk to him.

05:59.985 --> 06:01.111
I'll have a chat with him.

06:02.613 --> 06:03.864
Okay, mate, thanks very much.

06:03.947 --> 06:06.825
Why are you showing people the flat
I told you I wanted to buy?

06:06.909 --> 06:09.369
-Well, you're welcome to put an offer in.
-Jase.

06:10.329 --> 06:12.122
I'm just waiting
for the money to come through,

06:12.206 --> 06:15.292
but don't we get, like, first dibs
because we're sitting tenants or whatever?

06:15.375 --> 06:16.919
Did you get that case study I sent you?

06:17.002 --> 06:18.337
-You sent me a link…
-Jason.

06:18.420 --> 06:20.756
…for a recipe for a Victoria sponge cake.

06:21.673 --> 06:22.883
Did I?

06:22.966 --> 06:25.177
-I mean, I forwarded it on…
-No, that isn't what--

06:25.260 --> 06:26.720
-…but it's not hopeful.
-Okay.

06:26.803 --> 06:30.057
-All right. Cheers then.
-Yeah, all right.

06:31.683 --> 06:33.185
-What's going on?
-What? Nothing.

06:33.268 --> 06:35.938
This door's playing up.
Something wrong with it.

06:36.021 --> 06:37.147
Is everything okay?

06:37.231 --> 06:39.775
Yeah, we-- It's fine.

06:43.737 --> 06:44.988
That's weird. It's fine now.

06:54.665 --> 06:57.376
Hi, how are you?

07:02.464 --> 07:04.758
Yeah. Bring on the après-ski.

07:04.842 --> 07:05.843
Nope.

07:10.681 --> 07:11.849
-Nikki.
-Yeah?

07:13.350 --> 07:14.476
-Nikki.
-What?

07:15.519 --> 07:17.729
Okay, Nikki, I need to tell you something,

07:17.813 --> 07:20.482
and I'm not sure how to tell you
or how you'll feel.

07:20.566 --> 07:21.984
Why do you keep saying my name?

07:22.067 --> 07:23.944
I'm the only person here.

07:24.027 --> 07:25.028
-Nikki.
-Again.

07:27.406 --> 07:28.240
I'm pregnant.

07:36.915 --> 07:37.916
Wow.

07:38.000 --> 07:39.293
I know. I'm sorry.

07:40.544 --> 07:41.837
Why are you saying sorry?

07:42.421 --> 07:43.338
Don't know.

07:43.422 --> 07:45.716
-We didn't know you were trying.
-We weren't.

07:47.759 --> 07:48.719
I'm sorry.

07:48.802 --> 07:50.262
Stop saying sorry.

07:51.263 --> 07:52.764
It's amazing.

07:55.767 --> 07:57.060
It's amazing.

07:59.980 --> 08:02.065
I know I never wanted to, you know…

08:02.149 --> 08:05.527
But then it just happened, and I dunno.

08:05.611 --> 08:08.280
I was heading for
a totally self-centered life.

08:08.363 --> 08:10.157
I mean,
I was just planning on getting a dog.

08:13.160 --> 08:15.245
I wish babies grew up as fast as dogs.

08:15.329 --> 08:18.332
Well, I mean, babies give you
90% more joy than dogs,

08:18.415 --> 08:20.792
and they're, like, 15% more work.

08:20.876 --> 08:21.877
So…

08:23.253 --> 08:25.172
I mean, they do seem popular.

08:25.255 --> 08:27.007
Yeah, they've really caught on.

08:27.841 --> 08:29.176
Most people have them.

08:29.927 --> 08:31.637
I mean, Pharrell Williams has them.

08:32.221 --> 08:34.847
-Yep.
-And Adele. And John Krasinski.

08:35.640 --> 08:38.434
-And Steffi Graf. And--
-Are we just listing everyone with kids?

08:38.519 --> 08:39.727
Yeah.

08:40.562 --> 08:41.772
It's comforting.

08:43.023 --> 08:44.358
I'll need help.

08:46.735 --> 08:47.736
Of course.

08:48.695 --> 08:52.199
I am surprised.
You haven't noticed something's up.

08:52.282 --> 08:55.702
I've been quite snappy
and argumentative recently.

08:57.037 --> 08:59.831
Right, yeah. That is unusual.

09:12.886 --> 09:13.887
Hey, babe.

09:14.847 --> 09:16.098
Just in time.

09:17.391 --> 09:18.392
Karen's pregnant.

09:23.021 --> 09:24.231
Okay.

09:27.150 --> 09:28.151
You all right?

09:30.988 --> 09:32.698
I mean, it's fine.

09:32.781 --> 09:33.782
I just-- It's--

09:33.866 --> 09:35.617
You know, it's a bit of a surprise.

09:36.159 --> 09:38.328
I thought I knew what she wanted,
you know?

09:38.412 --> 09:39.580
But, I mean, it's fine.

09:40.414 --> 09:41.874
It's all fine.

09:42.624 --> 09:46.170
-It's totally fine.
-Hey, hey, hey. Okay.

09:47.171 --> 09:48.755
I mean, it sounds like it's fine.

09:48.839 --> 09:49.840
Yeah.

09:58.015 --> 09:59.975
If I say something, will you just--

10:00.058 --> 10:02.895
-I'll say it, then you forget I said it.
-I'm way ahead of you. What?

10:04.396 --> 10:06.565
Do you think biology does
all the heavy lifting?

10:06.648 --> 10:08.859
Like, do you think
Karen's kid will love her

10:08.942 --> 10:10.527
more than these kids can love us?

10:10.611 --> 10:13.405
No. I mean, I think they've just had
a bit of a head start on us.

10:13.488 --> 10:17.201
I mean, we have to work
a bit harder, but no, no, no.

10:17.284 --> 10:18.285
Okay.

10:21.705 --> 10:23.832
Is it okay if we don't invite Karen
to Tyler's birthday?

10:23.916 --> 10:24.958
Of course, yeah.

10:25.667 --> 10:28.045
-I mean, she is making the cake.
-Yes.

10:32.007 --> 10:33.217
Did you make any friends at school?

10:36.136 --> 10:39.473
-You know I don't like people.
-Jason!

10:39.556 --> 10:40.557
You have to make friends,

10:40.641 --> 10:43.227
otherwise you're just some bloke
in a playground that no one knows.

10:43.310 --> 10:45.896
All right, so I go over to have
a chat with that-- What's his name?

10:45.979 --> 10:47.481
-The-- Oscar. Right?
-Oscar.

10:47.564 --> 10:49.399
I'm on the way to talk to him,
and I'm like,

10:49.483 --> 10:52.528
"What have I got in common with
this deck-shoed-wearing, floppy-haired,

10:52.611 --> 10:54.988
November-tan Hampstead boy? Nothing.

10:55.697 --> 10:57.449
I tell you what you've got
in common with him.

10:57.533 --> 10:59.868
You've got a son
that's in the same class as his son.

10:59.952 --> 11:03.413
Did you know that
all of his kids are in the orchestra?

11:03.497 --> 11:05.958
-So?
-All of them. He's so smug about it.

11:06.041 --> 11:08.126
I'm like, all it is, is blowing. Whatever.

11:10.546 --> 11:13.215
Hello, kiddiewinks. Good day at school?

11:13.841 --> 11:16.760
Yeah? Here you go, some of your pizza.

11:18.011 --> 11:20.389
Buddy, did you hand out all your invites?

11:20.973 --> 11:22.641
Yeah? What did they say?

11:22.724 --> 11:23.976
Thanks.

11:24.518 --> 11:27.563
And after that,
did they say they were excited to come?

11:27.646 --> 11:28.772
Wanna show me your list?

11:35.028 --> 11:36.280
Oh, no.

11:39.867 --> 11:42.661
-Hello. Scott?
-In here, my love.

11:49.668 --> 11:53.422
-Can I have a chat? I've got some--
-Amazing news.

11:53.505 --> 11:54.506
Send.

11:55.132 --> 11:57.593
I've got a publisher
interested in my blog.

11:59.303 --> 12:01.722
Wow, that's great. Has he read it?

12:01.805 --> 12:03.849
He said I remind him of Jonathan Franzen.

12:05.475 --> 12:08.145
Only in looks, but still.
This could be my break. This could be it.

12:08.228 --> 12:09.521
-I could leave my job.
-What?

12:10.647 --> 12:12.024
You've literally just got one.

12:12.649 --> 12:13.942
You only just got your log-in details.

12:14.026 --> 12:16.862
I know, it's a risk. But listen,
I mean, if not now, when? Right?

12:17.821 --> 12:19.531
How about 18 years and eight months?

12:21.033 --> 12:22.034
Nothing.

12:23.118 --> 12:24.453
Okay.

12:25.037 --> 12:26.371
Jase, we've got a bit of a problem.

12:26.455 --> 12:28.165
-What now?
-No kids are coming tomorrow.

12:29.041 --> 12:30.042
What, why?

12:30.125 --> 12:33.253
I will you tell why.
Because he hasn't invited any.

12:33.837 --> 12:36.507
Look at his list.
This is Miss Keele, teacher.

12:36.590 --> 12:38.383
Miss Sheridan, teaching assistant.

12:38.467 --> 12:40.677
-Beryl the dinner lady.
-Beryl?

12:40.761 --> 12:42.471
Bill the lollipop man.

12:42.554 --> 12:44.806
-Bill's stick.
-That's good his stick's coming.

12:44.890 --> 12:47.935
And Estuary FM Breakfast Show host
Dan Graham.

12:48.018 --> 12:50.437
Jase, these are not realistic gets.

12:51.396 --> 12:52.856
He's quite adorable though,
innit? Come on.

12:52.940 --> 12:55.567
But it'll be very un-adorable
tomorrow when no one turns up.

12:55.651 --> 12:57.569
No adult is gonna want to come
to a kid's party.

12:57.653 --> 13:00.155
And any adult that does want to come,
we don't want there.

13:00.239 --> 13:01.990
Especially a DJ.

13:02.074 --> 13:04.368
Look, if he doesn't want to invite kids
to his party,

13:04.451 --> 13:07.287
-what are we supposed to do about it?
-We have to help him make friends.

13:07.371 --> 13:10.249
He can't just avoid people
just because he's finding them difficult.

13:10.332 --> 13:11.667
Hang on, you literally just said

13:11.750 --> 13:14.503
you wanted to uninvite your own sister
to his party, so I don't…

13:14.586 --> 13:18.590
We can't have that boy turn up
to an empty birthday party.

13:18.674 --> 13:20.926
We-- No, we need to get kids there.

13:21.009 --> 13:22.636
Yeah, no, you're right. Okay.

13:22.719 --> 13:24.471
Well, I haven't got anyone's numbers.

13:24.555 --> 13:28.016
Well, no,
because you have not made any friends.

13:29.852 --> 13:30.936
Okay.

13:31.019 --> 13:33.647
One of the parents is a hairdresser,

13:33.730 --> 13:36.733
and she gave me her card,
which, frankly, rude.

13:36.817 --> 13:39.862
But maybe I'll just call her
and get everyone's number.

13:40.571 --> 13:41.822
Okay.

13:41.905 --> 13:43.782
At least Karen can't do this.

13:50.455 --> 13:51.290
Bloody hell.

14:03.969 --> 14:05.012
Blimey!

14:05.804 --> 14:06.805
Hello, mate.

14:07.848 --> 14:09.183
Is it enough do you think?

14:10.058 --> 14:13.103
-Yeah. Yeah, I think it's about right.
-Okay.

14:13.187 --> 14:14.855
-Did he recently walk on the moon?
-Oi.

14:14.938 --> 14:17.024
-Is that what--
-This is what trying harder looks like.

14:27.326 --> 14:28.827
-Hello.
-Hi!

14:28.911 --> 14:30.996
Hi, how are you?

14:31.079 --> 14:32.122
I'm good.

14:41.757 --> 14:44.927
Who wants to play musical chairs, yeah?

14:45.010 --> 14:47.179
Anyone? Wants to play--

14:47.262 --> 14:49.223
-Hello!
-Where's Tyler?

14:49.306 --> 14:50.474
Oh, yeah.

14:51.433 --> 14:52.768
He is--

14:54.061 --> 14:55.062
Hello.

14:55.562 --> 14:57.189
-One cake.
-Thank you.

14:58.899 --> 15:00.150
Where's Scott?

15:00.234 --> 15:02.486
-He's getting ready.
-Getting ready for what?

15:02.569 --> 15:04.404
I can't. I just can't.

15:06.698 --> 15:07.699
Oh, my God.

15:09.993 --> 15:11.995
Karen mentioned you were sans entertainer.

15:12.829 --> 15:14.998
Yeah, no.
We didn't think we'd need one.

15:15.082 --> 15:16.542
Oh, no. You definitely do.

15:17.709 --> 15:19.378
Well have you done it before?

15:19.461 --> 15:20.879
Like, do you know what to do?

15:20.963 --> 15:23.465
Studied at the Philippe Gaulier school
a couple of years ago.

15:23.549 --> 15:25.759
Absolutely thrilled to explore again.

15:25.843 --> 15:28.053
Right. But, I mean,
do you have any of the stuff?

15:28.136 --> 15:29.972
You know, the handkerchiefs.

15:30.806 --> 15:33.267
I work inside
and outside the dramatic fiction

15:33.350 --> 15:38.438
to transgress mimetic convention towards
a deeper understanding of clowning, so…

15:38.522 --> 15:40.899
No, I don't have handkerchiefs.

15:41.817 --> 15:44.736
Sort of think they'll want
handkerchiefs and that sort of thing.

15:44.820 --> 15:48.365
Performance is a negotiation, isn't it?

15:49.283 --> 15:51.285
So, I think we'll find our way.

15:59.209 --> 16:01.795
-What did he say when you told him?
-I haven't told him yet.

16:01.879 --> 16:03.005
What? Why?

16:03.088 --> 16:05.215
Well, last night wasn't the right time.

16:05.883 --> 16:07.718
And now he's dressed
like an absolute dickhead.

16:07.801 --> 16:09.720
I don't want any reason
for this to stick in my memory.

16:09.803 --> 16:11.263
Why are there so few kids here?

16:11.346 --> 16:13.724
Oh, yeah,
we let Tyler hand out the invites.

16:13.807 --> 16:15.893
Oh, no, you should never do that.

16:15.976 --> 16:17.978
And did you not ask the parents to stay?

16:19.521 --> 16:20.522
-No.
-Okay.

16:20.606 --> 16:22.024
Well, you should've done that.

16:22.107 --> 16:25.944
I mean, at my school, it's a minimum
of two adults in every classroom.

16:26.028 --> 16:28.030
I mean, I am mentally absent a lot, so…

16:28.655 --> 16:30.616
Don't worry.
I snap back if I see blood.

16:30.699 --> 16:31.783
All right. Come on.

16:37.581 --> 16:39.791
-No! Okay.
-No, don't grab. Thank you.

16:39.875 --> 16:41.084
I'll pass them out. Good boy.

16:41.168 --> 16:42.961
-Take one. There you go.
-Here you go.

16:43.837 --> 16:45.047
There you go.

16:45.130 --> 16:47.049
-Do you want one?
-Where is Tyler?

16:47.132 --> 16:48.717
Can I get some thank-you-- I don't know.

16:49.343 --> 16:50.344
Can I have one?

16:50.427 --> 16:51.845
I haven't seen him in ages…

16:51.929 --> 16:54.056
-Where-- Tyler?
-Tyler?

16:54.806 --> 16:56.058
-Tyler?
-Tyler?

16:56.141 --> 16:57.434
Have you seen your brother?

17:04.066 --> 17:05.067
Tyler, mate?

17:13.659 --> 17:15.618
What are you doing under here?

17:15.702 --> 17:18.163
Do you not wanna come out?
There's friends here to see ya.

17:20.040 --> 17:21.708
Is it a bit much?

17:21.791 --> 17:23.335
Yeah? You a bit scared?

17:31.343 --> 17:32.886
I'm sorry, Tyler.

17:36.348 --> 17:37.724
He's under the table.

17:37.808 --> 17:39.768
I made a mistake. It's too much for him.

17:39.852 --> 17:40.853
Will you have a go?

17:40.936 --> 17:42.479
-Where? Under there?
-Yeah.

17:42.563 --> 17:43.397
What is he--

17:47.442 --> 17:49.069
Princess seems a bit bored.

17:49.611 --> 17:51.363
Have you organized any other games?

17:51.446 --> 17:54.616
No, I haven't. Because clearly,
I don't know what I'm doing.

17:54.700 --> 17:57.786
Hey! Don't be so hard on yourself.

17:58.871 --> 18:00.873
Other people's kids can be awful.

18:00.956 --> 18:02.666
Not everyone can manage them.

18:02.749 --> 18:04.501
Don't worry. I'm here now.

18:05.335 --> 18:08.338
Right, you lot. Listen up!
Calm down, calm down. Oi!

18:08.422 --> 18:11.133
You can do that,
but it'll be the last thing you do.

18:14.845 --> 18:16.221
It's okay. Don't worry.

18:16.305 --> 18:17.598
No one likes parties.

18:17.681 --> 18:20.475
Well, unless you're an alcoholic
or dead inside.

18:21.143 --> 18:23.145
I once got really annoyed
and told everyone to leave.

18:23.937 --> 18:25.397
Wasn't even my party.

18:28.942 --> 18:29.943
Do you want a mini Kiev?

18:30.777 --> 18:31.778
Stay there.

18:45.959 --> 18:47.294
Right.

18:47.878 --> 18:49.671
Yeah I'm in here now too.

18:51.131 --> 18:53.467
Look, is this really the example
we want to be setting?

18:53.550 --> 18:54.635
If he's gonna be under here,

18:54.718 --> 18:56.637
he's not gonna be here
on his own, is he? So…

18:56.720 --> 18:57.763
Thank you.

18:58.764 --> 19:00.474
Also, Karen's upset me, so…

19:02.434 --> 19:03.810
We're staying here, aren't we?

19:03.894 --> 19:07.231
We've decided the outside is hard
and people say mean things.

19:07.314 --> 19:08.315
Okay?

19:09.650 --> 19:10.901
Righto.

19:14.821 --> 19:16.114
Hello, Scott, mate.

19:16.198 --> 19:18.116
Can we have a bit of a chat
about that money?

19:18.200 --> 19:21.620
Relax. You're in safe hands.

19:28.919 --> 19:30.546
It's quite nice in here, isn't it?

19:30.629 --> 19:33.423
Hello.
Yeah, I was just looking for some advice.

19:36.176 --> 19:37.719
I've just been feeling very tired,

19:37.803 --> 19:39.721
and I didn't know if that was normal.

19:41.431 --> 19:42.808
I just wanted to talk to someone.

19:45.310 --> 19:47.104
Well, it's Karen. Karen Newman.

19:50.274 --> 19:52.234
Well, is now a good time
or should I call--

19:53.610 --> 19:55.821
Yeah, no, I saw the consultant last week.

19:55.904 --> 19:59.575
I'm an older pregnancy,
and I was just a bit worried that--

20:00.242 --> 20:02.578
Well, I've had some stomachaches
with my morning sickness.

20:02.661 --> 20:05.247
And, you know,
you just get paranoid, don't you? So…

20:06.748 --> 20:08.625
Well, is there someone I can speak to now?

20:10.711 --> 20:13.380
No? Okay, that's fine.

20:13.463 --> 20:15.757
I'll call on Monday. Thanks.

20:24.433 --> 20:25.517
You know what…

20:28.937 --> 20:30.814
I don't think
the world's going anywhere, is it?

20:31.648 --> 20:34.359
I think it's staying out there
longer than we can stay in here.

20:36.111 --> 20:37.362
You still feeling funny?

20:38.906 --> 20:40.866
-How?
-In my tummy.

20:40.949 --> 20:46.496
Okay. Well, the thing is
about sicky tummy feelings,

20:47.497 --> 20:51.043
you only normally get them
before something exciting's gonna happen.

20:51.627 --> 20:54.338
It's not a bad thing.
It means something good is coming.

20:54.421 --> 20:55.714
It's called butterflies.

20:56.381 --> 20:57.424
Really?

20:57.508 --> 21:01.470
The key is to do
one little thing at a time. Okay?

21:02.471 --> 21:03.889
Little steps.

21:04.806 --> 21:06.183
Little steps.

21:30.207 --> 21:31.250
There he is.

21:33.585 --> 21:34.586
Well done.

21:35.462 --> 21:36.463
What's all that about?

21:36.547 --> 21:38.966
Yeah. Just half-arsing some role modeling.

21:39.842 --> 21:41.260
That's better than no-arsing it.

21:41.927 --> 21:42.970
-Yeah.
-Isn't it?

21:44.680 --> 21:46.223
-Look.
-Look out.

21:50.435 --> 21:52.145
Marcel Marceau over there. Look.

21:52.896 --> 21:54.439
It's not funny.

22:12.666 --> 22:14.459
I'm not good with them, Nik.

22:15.878 --> 22:17.546
Look, I can organize them,
but the other stuff…

22:18.672 --> 22:20.257
it just doesn't come naturally.

22:20.340 --> 22:22.134
Well, that's okay.

22:22.926 --> 22:24.553
You've got him, haven't you?

22:24.636 --> 22:27.014
He can be the kid,
and you can be the grown-up.

22:27.097 --> 22:28.473
He can dress up and play with them,

22:28.557 --> 22:31.685
and you can renew contents insurance
and put bay leaves in stuff.

22:35.355 --> 22:38.567
-He's gonna make me get a doula, isn't he?
-Oh, yeah, 100%.

22:48.452 --> 22:49.828
Why?

22:50.621 --> 22:52.456
For crying out loud.

22:57.586 --> 22:59.963
Why?

23:30.118 --> 23:33.747
It's the icing. I put raw eggs in.

24:24.590 --> 24:26.383
So this is my friend, Adam.

24:26.466 --> 24:30.179
He's my friend because he's supportive
in a non-judgmental way.

24:30.262 --> 24:32.806
I'm not sure they understand him. Do we?

24:34.725 --> 24:36.894
I think we're getting there. Yeah.

24:38.812 --> 24:42.399
-I don't believe it. Tyler's teacher.
-Now then, now then, where's Tyler?

24:42.482 --> 24:43.775
Miss!

24:43.859 --> 24:46.445
Oh, my God. They came!

24:47.154 --> 24:48.155
-Sorry we're late.
-Hi.

24:48.238 --> 24:50.324
Bill can't use a satnav, ironically.

24:50.407 --> 24:51.825
I mean, is it ironic?

24:51.909 --> 24:53.660
He's a lollipop man.
Feels like it is somehow.

24:54.578 --> 24:55.662
What are you doing here?

24:55.746 --> 24:56.747
Are you kidding?

24:56.830 --> 25:00.042
Most kids don't even talk to us, never
mind ask us to their birthday parties.

25:00.626 --> 25:02.127
He is a very special boy.

25:02.211 --> 25:04.004
Yeah. He is.

25:06.632 --> 25:09.760
-Hello! Happy birthday, Tyler!
-Come on.

25:18.268 --> 25:20.521
Happy birthday…

25:21.271 --> 25:22.481
Yay!

25:45.295 --> 25:47.422
I wish I could stop getting things wrong.

25:47.506 --> 25:49.258
Listen, we're doing all right.

25:50.717 --> 25:53.136
The last time we were at a seventh
birthday party, we were seven.

25:53.720 --> 25:56.723
Most people have six practice runs
before doing this. Don't they?

25:57.307 --> 25:58.600
As long as we keep making our mistakes

25:58.684 --> 26:01.687
in the right direction,
then we're okay. I think.

26:03.522 --> 26:08.026
How do we take a child
who can't even recognize their emotions

26:08.110 --> 26:10.696
and teach him to manage them
like an adult?

26:10.779 --> 26:14.199
I don't know. I suppose we just…

26:17.035 --> 26:18.412
do whatever we did with me.

26:22.708 --> 26:24.960
It's coming up for 7:30 in the a.m.

26:25.043 --> 26:26.753
You are listening to Estuary FM.

26:27.337 --> 26:30.549
Just time for a late shout-out
to Princess and Tyler.

26:30.632 --> 26:34.303
Happy birthday, Tyler.
Lots of love. Nikki and Jason.

26:34.386 --> 26:38.140
Sorry I couldn't come to your party,
but the weekend is when I see my kids.

26:38.223 --> 26:41.977
Taking us into the traffic is Bear's Den
featuring Jade Bird.
