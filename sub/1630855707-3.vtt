WEBVTT

01:04.897 --> 01:07.943
Laser Array Frequency Test 19-B,

01:08.777 --> 01:09.778
commence.

01:19.830 --> 01:20.914
Check levels.

01:22.124 --> 01:23.125
Levels are a go.

01:23.917 --> 01:25.919
Okay. We're operational.

01:27.671 --> 01:29.214
-I'm on my way out.
-Copy that.

01:52.070 --> 01:54.615
Yamato? Coming?

01:58.994 --> 02:00.162
On my way.

02:33.445 --> 02:35.447
Go to 44 kilohertz.

02:38.742 --> 02:39.743
Go to UHF.

02:40.702 --> 02:42.162
No change.

02:42.746 --> 02:44.289
We can adjust amplitude.

02:44.790 --> 02:46.041
Why is it not working?

02:50.212 --> 02:51.213
Damn.

02:51.713 --> 02:54.007
Lost my bet.
I thought soonest would be tomorrow.

02:57.636 --> 02:58.637
What is this?

02:59.721 --> 03:02.099
Once in a while,
the alien emits this signal.

03:02.850 --> 03:05.227
We don't know why
but it is always the same.

03:05.811 --> 03:07.646
Here. Check it out.

03:09.273 --> 03:11.316
-And now.
-And now.

03:13.068 --> 03:14.069
That's it.

03:18.115 --> 03:19.241
What's it doing?

03:19.950 --> 03:21.326
No idea.

03:21.952 --> 03:22.953
Transmit to Nikhil.

03:23.453 --> 03:26.373
-Done.
-It's probably just dying gasps.

03:27.291 --> 03:30.335
The ship is like
a giant damaged bio-organism.

03:31.211 --> 03:32.212
Alien gas.

03:37.342 --> 03:38.635
How often does it happen?

03:39.303 --> 03:42.472
Sometimes it's days, sometimes hours.

03:42.973 --> 03:44.641
Nikhil was all excited in the beginning,

03:44.725 --> 03:46.935
but now it just goes
in the data slush pile.

03:47.477 --> 03:49.396
There's only so much bandwidth
in the apocalypse.

03:49.479 --> 03:50.981
Base Camp Three, come in.

03:52.107 --> 03:53.233
Base Camp Three here.

03:53.317 --> 03:55.360
Requesting Mitsuki Yamato to the clinic.

03:55.986 --> 03:57.070
Copy. Out.

03:57.779 --> 03:59.531
Time to get your brain scanned.

04:00.490 --> 04:03.660
This is not necessary. I'm fine.
I need to get back.

04:03.744 --> 04:07.623
There's increased activity
in the angular gyrus and Wernicke's.

04:08.540 --> 04:12.127
Sounds or voices
with no identifiable source?

04:15.964 --> 04:18.634
I didn't say anything yet.
Why are you writing?

04:18.716 --> 04:21.094
And if you say you'll answer my question
when this is done--

04:21.178 --> 04:23.764
Then I'll answer your question
when this is done.

04:23.847 --> 04:26.016
I'm fine. I'll tell you when I'm not.

04:26.099 --> 04:28.936
Actually, I'll tell you when you're not.

04:31.271 --> 04:32.898
But I'll let you get back to it.

04:37.736 --> 04:39.488
How's it coming?

04:40.197 --> 04:41.198
The work.

04:42.282 --> 04:44.826
Any progress establishing communication?

04:47.412 --> 04:48.497
Not really.

04:51.124 --> 04:52.125
But I can--

04:55.337 --> 04:57.047
Sometimes I feel likeâ€¦

05:00.592 --> 05:04.221
Like I can feel it watching me.

05:05.013 --> 05:06.765
Be careful in there, okay?

05:07.641 --> 05:09.309
You don't want it prying around
in your head

05:09.393 --> 05:11.979
any more than it wants you
exposing its secrets.

05:30.914 --> 05:31.915
Mitsuki?

05:32.499 --> 05:33.500
I know him.

05:35.961 --> 05:36.962
Oleg Varga.

05:37.754 --> 05:40.048
Won the Nobel Prize in physics
three years ago.

05:41.508 --> 05:42.509
Are you okay?

05:43.051 --> 05:44.511
-Yes, I'm--
-Fine.

05:45.262 --> 05:46.263
You know,

05:46.763 --> 05:48.724
now would be the time to ask me questions.

05:49.224 --> 05:51.185
I think they need you more than I do.

06:25.844 --> 06:26.845
What did you do?

06:27.596 --> 06:30.182
Nothing. We're running the sequences.
Still no response.

06:30.265 --> 06:31.433
Do that last one again.

06:32.434 --> 06:33.560
What?

06:33.644 --> 06:34.645
Do it again.

06:41.610 --> 06:43.070
Run 92. Go.

06:45.656 --> 06:46.698
Reading's stable.

06:47.699 --> 06:48.867
What's she doing?

06:48.951 --> 06:49.952
I don't know.

06:50.035 --> 06:51.370
Go back one more.

06:52.329 --> 06:53.539
Run 91, go.

06:55.457 --> 06:56.542
Stable.

06:58.043 --> 06:59.461
Run 90, go.

07:01.213 --> 07:02.548
That one. Do it again.

07:03.090 --> 07:04.341
Uh. Hey, Yamato.

07:05.050 --> 07:06.969
-What's going on?
-Come down here.

07:07.553 --> 07:08.554
Bring the transmitter.

07:13.433 --> 07:16.353
-Think we got another burnout?
-Yeah. We'll see.

07:20.065 --> 07:22.025
These things creep me out.

07:27.239 --> 07:30.200
Yamato, what's going on?

07:30.993 --> 07:32.035
Run it again.

07:34.663 --> 07:35.664
Run 90.

07:37.541 --> 07:38.542
Go.

07:51.847 --> 07:52.848
Holy shi--

09:36.577 --> 09:38.704
Why would you mark a stolen car like that?

09:39.955 --> 09:40.956
What if they see?

09:41.874 --> 09:44.459
They care more
about people finding us than hiding.

09:45.210 --> 09:48.922
The Movement's number one directive is
we don't abandon people.

09:51.008 --> 09:52.009
It's a good rule.

09:56.180 --> 09:57.556
Where are you guys from?

09:58.932 --> 10:00.267
Marion, Ohio.

10:01.518 --> 10:07.441
It's this little nothing town,
kind of in the middle of nowhere.

10:08.275 --> 10:10.569
But I guess
everywhere is kind of nowhere now.

10:11.403 --> 10:12.613
What about you?

10:12.696 --> 10:13.864
New York.

10:15.157 --> 10:19.161
What was that language that you
and your mom were speaking this morning?

10:19.828 --> 10:21.163
She's teaching us Farsi.

10:22.206 --> 10:24.416
She grew up in Syria
but her mom's Iranian.

10:25.751 --> 10:28.962
I don't know.
I guess she misses home or something.

10:29.046 --> 10:31.590
Ry, honey. Let's get everybody loaded up.

10:44.811 --> 10:46.813
I don't think your mother
would like you doing that.

11:00.911 --> 11:03.247
Hey, give me that can
before your mom sees.

11:03.330 --> 11:05.207
-Sam.
-Too late.

11:13.423 --> 11:14.466
Go inside.

11:15.050 --> 11:16.802
Make sure your sister's things
are all packed.

11:16.885 --> 11:18.053
I'll meet you there.

11:18.679 --> 11:21.056
There. In two minutes. Go.

11:30.774 --> 11:31.775
What is this?

11:34.570 --> 11:36.321
Just a kid being a kid, I guess.

11:39.074 --> 11:41.159
Take us to the next refugee center.

11:43.203 --> 11:44.663
Do not talk to my kids.

11:46.123 --> 11:47.249
Okay.

11:51.003 --> 11:52.629
You ever let your guard down?

11:53.755 --> 11:55.090
What?

11:55.174 --> 11:57.301
I said, "Do you ever let your guard down?"

11:59.720 --> 12:02.347
How do you expect your kids to do it
if you don't know how to do it yourself?

12:03.974 --> 12:06.435
Keeping this guard up has kept us alive.

12:07.561 --> 12:09.605
We will take the ride, thank you.

12:10.230 --> 12:11.690
We will be out of your way.

12:17.863 --> 12:19.114
Okay, let's go!

12:33.086 --> 12:34.213
Morning, Wade.

12:37.174 --> 12:39.510
-Morning, Rosey.
-Did you ask him yet?

12:39.593 --> 12:42.888
Rosey, he's busy. You know the military
has got the sheriff running around.

12:43.388 --> 12:47.059
-I'm pushing water uphill here, Wade.
-Hey, they brought a guy in last night.

12:47.142 --> 12:49.394
He's in the cell.
Okay, transpo will get him this afternoon.

12:49.478 --> 12:51.063
And what am I supposed to do? Feed him?

12:51.146 --> 12:52.856
Yeah. I mean, that'd be humane.

12:53.482 --> 12:56.818
-Thirty-seven, as of yesterday, Wade.
-I know, Rosey. I know.

12:56.902 --> 12:58.320
I just don't know what I can--

13:00.405 --> 13:01.406
I'll ask him.

13:02.282 --> 13:03.283
Please.

13:03.992 --> 13:05.494
Thank you.

13:12.459 --> 13:14.711
It's about damn time!

13:14.795 --> 13:17.631
I've been here all night.
Y'all ain't got no on-duty officers?

13:17.714 --> 13:19.341
Now, come on. What's that about?

13:20.592 --> 13:24.763
Apologies. We're a little short-staffed
on account of the whole alien invasion.

13:26.014 --> 13:27.850
Transport will be here
in a couple of hours.

13:27.933 --> 13:29.643
Just sit tight until then.

13:36.149 --> 13:38.026
Good morning, Miss Jilly.

13:39.444 --> 13:42.322
Okay, now. You know
I'd call if there was any news, right?

13:42.406 --> 13:43.907
I'm sorry, no.

13:45.158 --> 13:46.368
You holding up okay?

13:48.996 --> 13:51.123
I'm okay, ma'am. Thanks for asking.

13:52.124 --> 13:54.209
Okay, I'll talk to you tomorrow.

13:55.836 --> 13:58.422
You guys got nothing to hold me on.
Check your logs.

13:59.131 --> 14:00.299
Go ahead, check them.

14:01.758 --> 14:04.303
You're talking to the wrong person, buddy.
I just answer phones.

14:04.386 --> 14:05.387
Okay, fine. Look.

14:07.890 --> 14:09.433
Please, I came in here with a notebook.

14:09.516 --> 14:11.643
I just want to know where it is
and know that it's safe.

14:11.727 --> 14:13.729
I assure you your belongings are safe,

14:13.812 --> 14:16.940
and will be returned to you
when the van gets here.

14:17.024 --> 14:19.359
I'll get you breakfast in a bit.
I've got work.

14:19.443 --> 14:21.987
Okay, like tracking down
all these missing people?

14:23.405 --> 14:26.450
I mean there's gotta be at least
30-something posters on these walls

14:26.533 --> 14:29.536
and it looks to me you're gonna need
all the help that you can get.

14:29.620 --> 14:31.914
How about you let me out this cell
and get me my notebook

14:31.997 --> 14:34.541
before you run out of citizens
to go missing and walls to put 'em on.

14:34.625 --> 14:37.252
Why? 'Cause you're gonna
help me find these people?

14:37.336 --> 14:38.921
If you give me my notebook, yeah.

14:43.091 --> 14:44.343
You've lost someone.

14:47.054 --> 14:48.055
You got that look.

15:00.692 --> 15:01.693
Which one's yours?

15:02.903 --> 15:04.363
Maybe I can help you find them.

15:05.781 --> 15:06.823
That's not funny.

15:06.907 --> 15:09.201
-I'm not trying to be funny.
-Okay.

15:11.370 --> 15:13.121
See, I get the savior complex.

15:14.248 --> 15:18.210
Hell, I wish some random guy
in a jail cell had the answer,

15:18.293 --> 15:21.672
but I'm afraid Mr.--
Sorry, what's your name?

15:21.755 --> 15:23.131
Cole. Trevante Cole.

15:23.215 --> 15:26.134
Navy SEAL.
Two tours Afghanistan, one tour Iraq.

15:26.218 --> 15:27.219
One of them.

15:30.389 --> 15:31.765
Let me show you something.

15:37.437 --> 15:38.856
This guy's my favorite.

15:39.982 --> 15:43.569
This man hiked all the way from Alaska

15:43.652 --> 15:46.572
because he heard we had
an alien-fighting brigade

15:46.655 --> 15:47.990
and he wanted to join.

15:49.324 --> 15:51.493
This woman saw little green men
in a dream,

15:51.577 --> 15:53.412
wanted to make sure we had a sketch.

15:53.912 --> 15:57.499
This lady talks to the recently abducted.

15:57.583 --> 15:58.584
Can you do that?

15:59.543 --> 16:02.087
You know what every single one
of these people had in common?

16:02.171 --> 16:06.717
Every one of them came looking for
an answer, a reason, some bigger picture.

16:06.800 --> 16:10.262
But not one of them gave a goddamn
about this town.

16:11.680 --> 16:15.726
Jacquelyn ran the pet grooming business
in town for 20 years.

16:16.560 --> 16:21.732
Nels has three sons, seven grandkids,
and his wife still calls every morning

16:21.815 --> 16:24.151
to make sure that there's no news.

16:24.234 --> 16:26.278
Eileen Grady there,
we went to school together.

16:26.361 --> 16:27.613
She was Deputy here.

16:27.696 --> 16:31.033
That's who I've lost.
Everyone on these walls.

16:31.116 --> 16:33.535
And all those people out there
trying to live their lives,

16:33.619 --> 16:34.912
that's who I'm trying to keep safe.

16:34.995 --> 16:37.497
So you and your magic notebook

16:37.581 --> 16:40.626
can sit tight for a few hours
while I get back to work.

16:40.709 --> 16:42.669
And I'll make sure
you get on that transpo.

16:42.753 --> 16:45.964
I'll even throw in
coffee and a muffin if you hush up.

16:52.221 --> 16:53.972
We need to amplify the signal.

16:56.266 --> 16:57.768
Do you think it knows?

17:00.187 --> 17:01.980
That we triggered its cloaking signal?

17:06.652 --> 17:07.653
No idea.

17:08.529 --> 17:09.655
This is nuts.

17:10.239 --> 17:12.199
You've been here, what? A few days?

17:12.950 --> 17:15.243
We've never gotten near
this kind of discovery.

17:15.743 --> 17:19.205
Okay, stay in this frequency range.
Run it through VHF.

17:49.236 --> 17:50.237
Yamato.

17:53.907 --> 17:54.950
Yamato.

17:58.579 --> 17:59.580
You okay?

18:01.832 --> 18:02.833
Yeah.

18:04.459 --> 18:05.460
I'm fine.

18:08.005 --> 18:09.339
I need some air.

18:27.608 --> 18:29.193
You won't win.

18:30.819 --> 18:33.071
We have one of your ships down here.

18:48.545 --> 18:49.963
I know what it is!

18:50.756 --> 18:53.050
It's a distress call. Pull up the history.

18:53.133 --> 18:54.635
-What?
-The signal.

18:55.219 --> 18:57.971
I need to see every single instance
of the past four months.

18:58.055 --> 19:01.016
-It's not consistent. Look.
-There is no pattern.

19:01.683 --> 19:02.684
Watch.

19:09.358 --> 19:11.026
It fits with a cubic spline.

19:12.319 --> 19:13.320
It's not a dying gasp.

19:14.488 --> 19:15.489
It's a Mayday.

19:16.156 --> 19:17.866
It's sending an SOS.

19:17.950 --> 19:19.159
Sending it where?

19:19.243 --> 19:20.953
Now where would you send an SOS

19:21.036 --> 19:23.330
if you were the one downed ship
on our planet?

19:26.375 --> 19:29.545
If I'm right, the next signal is at 5:32.

19:30.587 --> 19:32.464
You wanna tell night shift not to come in?

19:33.715 --> 19:35.342
You've already had four hours
on the inside.

19:35.425 --> 19:37.261
That exceeds your proximity quota.

19:37.344 --> 19:39.763
You wanna tell me not to come in?

19:41.181 --> 19:44.101
Okay. So, if we can predict
the next signal, then what?

19:45.477 --> 19:46.937
We stop it from sending?

19:47.020 --> 19:49.481
No, we hack it.

20:09.293 --> 20:11.211
What are you doing here so late?

20:12.296 --> 20:13.547
What's the time?

20:13.630 --> 20:17.176
Only about 11 hours
after your allotted shift?

20:30.355 --> 20:32.232
I'm on the verge of something here.

20:33.025 --> 20:34.026
Yes.

20:35.986 --> 20:36.987
Yes, you are.

20:40.115 --> 20:41.283
You didn't ask the question

20:41.366 --> 20:43.911
because you don't want
to contemplate the answer.

20:46.413 --> 20:49.166
Every scientist in that room
had one thing in common.

20:51.585 --> 20:53.086
They all said they were fine,

20:54.922 --> 20:57.090
and they weren't fine.

21:00.135 --> 21:02.763
They all wanted
to stare into the mind of that alienâ€¦

21:05.098 --> 21:06.642
until they lost their own.

21:10.687 --> 21:12.564
I know you think you're different.

21:14.900 --> 21:16.235
But so did they.

21:18.695 --> 21:20.447
Every single one of them.

21:21.532 --> 21:22.574
Yes.

21:23.742 --> 21:25.953
"Yes" was the answer to your question.

21:33.085 --> 21:37.172
I believed Hinata was on that ship.

21:41.593 --> 21:43.178
And I blame myselfâ€¦

21:45.305 --> 21:46.723
for what happened to her.

21:49.893 --> 21:50.894
To the world.

21:53.272 --> 21:54.273
I know.

21:57.651 --> 22:00.779
But do you think it will make it better
if you punish yourself?

22:06.034 --> 22:10.539
It might make it better if I punish them.

22:15.919 --> 22:17.087
It's time.

22:18.005 --> 22:19.006
Follow me.

22:23.844 --> 22:25.053
All systems running.

22:27.306 --> 22:28.849
-Hi, Maya.
-Hey, Misha.

22:33.061 --> 22:37.149
Three, two, one.

22:37.816 --> 22:41.695
Yes! Yes, we got you!
We got you, you little bastard!

22:41.778 --> 22:43.405
What just happened?

22:43.488 --> 22:46.783
We-- She just figured out
how to hack the mother ship.

22:49.828 --> 22:54.458
And you think this SOS signal
is going up to the mother ship?

22:55.167 --> 22:56.168
Yes.

22:57.252 --> 22:59.046
It must not be receiving.

22:59.129 --> 23:02.132
Nothing's come down to retrieve the ship
or the alien.

23:02.216 --> 23:03.342
We don't know that.

23:03.425 --> 23:07.679
Well, I think I'd have noticed
an alien SWAT team on my doorstep.

23:08.180 --> 23:10.933
Maybe it's receiving
but decided one downed ship

23:11.016 --> 23:12.726
isn't enough for a rescue mission.

23:18.273 --> 23:19.608
This is insane.

23:20.150 --> 23:22.569
Which is why she thought
you would appreciate it.

23:25.072 --> 23:26.823
Maya, what's your role in all this?

23:26.907 --> 23:28.450
I'm just here for moral support.

23:29.117 --> 23:30.827
Some people find you intimidating.

23:31.703 --> 23:33.580
Thank you. Thank you for that, Maya.

23:35.666 --> 23:37.584
-Not her.
-No.

23:38.877 --> 23:44.424
So you're proposing that we piggyback
on this "maybe" transmission.

23:44.508 --> 23:45.634
And-- And what?

23:46.218 --> 23:48.220
-Hack into their mother ship?
-Yes.

23:49.555 --> 23:51.473
You're right, I love how insane this is.

23:54.059 --> 23:55.727
But what's the endgame?

23:57.771 --> 24:01.817
Let's-- Let's say your--
your premise proves right and we canâ€¦

24:03.569 --> 24:04.736
see the matrix.

24:05.487 --> 24:06.488
Then what, Neo?

24:07.698 --> 24:11.326
The aliens,
they are getting to Earth somehow.

24:12.286 --> 24:15.414
We don't know why there's more here
every day, everywhere.

24:16.039 --> 24:19.126
And it's because they've been using
this cloaking technology.

24:20.085 --> 24:23.964
If we can get a look at them,
we can target them.

24:25.299 --> 24:27.593
You want to decloak their transport ships?

24:27.676 --> 24:29.511
And shoot them out of the sky.

24:30.679 --> 24:31.763
There's a downside.

24:32.389 --> 24:33.891
What could possibly be a downside?

24:33.974 --> 24:35.893
Anything we hit crashes to Earth.

24:35.976 --> 24:38.770
That carrier out there
is the size of a small city.

24:38.854 --> 24:40.981
We risk killing more of us than them.

24:45.736 --> 24:46.862
Stalingrad.

24:49.364 --> 24:51.074
The Battle of Stalingrad.

24:51.658 --> 24:54.745
Everyone thought
it was the nukes on Japan, apologies,

24:54.828 --> 24:57.706
or D-Day
that turned the tide against the Nazis,

24:57.789 --> 25:02.085
but it was the win in Stalingrad
that Germany never recovered from.

25:02.836 --> 25:04.463
The deadliest battle in World War II.

25:04.546 --> 25:08.550
The Soviets lost over a million people,

25:09.676 --> 25:10.969
but they pushed them back.

25:12.679 --> 25:14.515
This is our Stalingrad.

25:18.477 --> 25:21.730
Besides, Earth's surface is 71% water.

25:22.773 --> 25:23.899
I'll take our odds.

25:25.359 --> 25:26.568
Are you insane?

25:27.986 --> 25:29.988
Maya-- Dr. Castillo.

25:30.072 --> 25:32.616
Do you wanna answer that question
from a clinical perspective?

25:32.699 --> 25:35.244
And does anyone ever say yes
to that question?

25:36.453 --> 25:38.747
You wanted a win?
I'm offering you a chance to--

25:38.830 --> 25:42.584
To order all of my nuclear arms operatives
to, quote,

25:42.668 --> 25:46.213
"Look up at the sky at 0942 UTC
and be at DEFCON 1."

25:46.713 --> 25:48.131
That's correct, ma'am.

25:48.215 --> 25:51.176
And if they see anything,
a particularly vague concept,

25:51.260 --> 25:52.469
to shoot it down.

25:52.553 --> 25:53.762
Right.

25:53.846 --> 25:55.889
We'll need the speed
and range of tactical nukes.

25:57.182 --> 26:01.019
We have something, Benya.
We really have something.

26:01.979 --> 26:04.314
I don't like to be wrong,
so you know I wouldn't ask

26:04.398 --> 26:06.942
if I didn't think
there was a very good chance.

26:07.025 --> 26:08.151
"A very good chance."

26:09.570 --> 26:10.571
How long?

26:12.030 --> 26:14.116
-Madam?
-How long would you like

26:14.199 --> 26:18.078
my nuclear operatives to stare at the sky
in the hope that something shall appear?

26:21.790 --> 26:23.041
I need an answer.

26:23.125 --> 26:24.168
I don't know.

26:24.251 --> 26:25.586
Then guess.

26:27.171 --> 26:28.255
Thirty minutes.

26:31.466 --> 26:32.968
Thirty minutes, Madam President.

26:34.261 --> 26:35.304
Thirty minutes.

26:35.804 --> 26:38.724
And tell them,
targeting needs to be ready to lock on.

26:39.224 --> 26:41.602
I don't know how long we'll have
before they cut the signal.

26:42.394 --> 26:44.521
Is there anything else I can do for you,
Miss Yamato?

26:46.231 --> 26:47.691
No, that's all.

26:48.358 --> 26:49.693
Thank you, Madam President.

26:50.736 --> 26:51.737
Ta-ta.

27:03.123 --> 27:04.208
Morning, Sheriff.

27:06.877 --> 27:08.086
Morning, Rose.

27:08.170 --> 27:09.171
You got a minute?

27:09.838 --> 27:11.840
If we got another problem
with this coffee machine--

27:11.924 --> 27:15.302
Oh, no, no, no. Well, actually, we do.

27:15.385 --> 27:17.137
But that's not what I wanted to discuss.

27:18.305 --> 27:19.306
I was just--

27:20.015 --> 27:23.602
Well, I was wondering if you'd
taken a look at those three new cases.

27:23.685 --> 27:25.812
I was looking at where
they were last seen,

27:25.896 --> 27:27.689
and maybe there are some kind of clues.

27:27.773 --> 27:30.943
Rose. We're trying our best, I promise.

27:31.026 --> 27:32.110
We're stretched thin.

27:32.194 --> 27:35.405
I know, I know.
Which is why I compiled everything.

27:35.489 --> 27:38.492
Put it all down along with
any connection to the other cases.

27:38.992 --> 27:41.745
Rosey, leave it to the professionals.

27:42.329 --> 27:45.707
Right. Well, just like you said.

27:45.791 --> 27:49.253
With everyone being stretched thin
and more folks disappearing,

27:49.336 --> 27:50.379
feels like every day now,

27:50.462 --> 27:52.339
I thought you'd appreciate
an extra set of hands.

27:52.422 --> 27:53.590
I do. I really do.

27:53.674 --> 27:54.842
Thank you, Rosey.

27:57.094 --> 27:59.805
Now let's get that
coffee machine working again, shall we?

28:09.314 --> 28:10.315
Damn it.

28:13.610 --> 28:14.653
You all right?

28:14.736 --> 28:16.697
Left my job at the shop
to make a difference

28:16.780 --> 28:19.116
and the only thing I'm making is coffee.

28:20.534 --> 28:21.660
Not even that.

28:21.743 --> 28:24.246
-Maybe, like I said, I can help.
-Yeah?

28:24.329 --> 28:26.665
Just like the military said
when they got here?

28:28.625 --> 28:30.544
"We can help. Just follow protocol."

28:30.627 --> 28:32.546
Y'all love that word, "protocol."

28:32.629 --> 28:33.672
And what they done?

28:33.755 --> 28:37.968
Just come in, took over,
turned the library into some kind of lab.

28:38.051 --> 28:41.263
Their big base over there?
Used to be our high school.

28:41.763 --> 28:44.892
Turned Ben Shelton's farm
into their supply depot or some shit.

28:44.975 --> 28:47.853
Ground zero in the Americas, lucky us.

28:47.936 --> 28:50.731
Our people keep disappearing,
but no one cares.

28:50.814 --> 28:52.691
Because what's 37 missing people,

28:52.774 --> 28:55.319
when a quarter of the world's gone dead
or missing?

28:55.903 --> 28:57.905
But every single one of them had a name.

28:58.488 --> 29:01.325
Everyone had a date
that they went missing.

29:01.408 --> 29:04.369
But soldiers treat those dates
like a death sentence

29:04.453 --> 29:05.871
to put on their tombstone.

29:05.954 --> 29:06.955
Dates.

29:15.839 --> 29:17.341
It's not a star.

29:19.218 --> 29:20.302
It's a badge.

29:21.303 --> 29:22.846
And those are the numbers.

29:24.598 --> 29:26.683
That was the sheriff right there?
That old guy, Tyson?

29:26.767 --> 29:29.186
Sure was. And let me tell you,
he would have done something

29:29.269 --> 29:30.270
if he was still here.

29:30.354 --> 29:31.647
What happened to him?

29:32.147 --> 29:33.857
One of the first to go missing.

29:33.941 --> 29:36.944
Night of his retirement party.
How's that for a joke?

29:38.820 --> 29:40.155
He brought me here.

29:40.239 --> 29:42.324
-That's not the kind of joke I meant.
-I'm serious.

29:42.407 --> 29:44.660
Hey, look.
I need you to get me that notebook.

29:44.743 --> 29:48.038
-We've been over this. It's in lockup. I--
-Look at me. Look at me. Look at me, okay?

29:48.121 --> 29:49.373
I know you've heard this before,

29:49.456 --> 29:53.126
and I know I sound as crazy as the rest,
but I'm telling you I've lost everything.

29:53.210 --> 29:55.963
Everything. I've lost hope down
to this second, but I'm telling you.

29:56.046 --> 29:57.047
You think you're desperate?

29:57.130 --> 30:00.175
Try sitting months in an Internet hub
trading rations for minutes,

30:00.259 --> 30:02.594
and staying there till 4:00 in the morning
every single night.

30:02.678 --> 30:05.931
Getting dead end, after dead end,
after dead end, getting nothing.

30:06.431 --> 30:10.060
Until now. Right this second,
I've found something, Rose.

30:10.143 --> 30:13.730
I need you to get me that notebook, okay?
So I can show you.

30:13.814 --> 30:17.067
And maybe, just maybe,
we can help each other.

30:19.570 --> 30:22.865
And you can save your town,
and I can win a goddamn war for a change.

30:24.825 --> 30:27.578
Look, Rose.
You need me like I need you, okay?

30:30.122 --> 30:33.792
Four months ago, a couple of strangers,
you know, they asked me for help.

30:34.877 --> 30:36.003
Kids.

30:36.086 --> 30:37.963
And I didn't wanna help them. I didn't.

30:39.173 --> 30:40.841
But I didn't have
anything else left to lose

30:40.924 --> 30:43.927
and that was the first time I actually
felt like I'd made a difference.

30:45.179 --> 30:47.848
So, now I'm asking you
from the bottom of my heart,

30:49.725 --> 30:50.976
what do you have to lose?

31:01.987 --> 31:03.614
Help! Help!

31:03.697 --> 31:05.449
-Ryder.
-Help us! Anybody?

31:05.532 --> 31:07.492
Mayday? What is your status and location?

31:07.576 --> 31:09.745
I repeat,
what is your status and location?

31:09.828 --> 31:11.371
We're trapped in the ravine!

31:11.455 --> 31:14.458
Give me your location.
Please, just specify your location.

31:14.541 --> 31:17.169
-I don't know. Elk's Pass.
-Elk's Pass.

31:18.212 --> 31:20.172
Hey there, folks.
We may have a rescue situation.

31:20.255 --> 31:21.256
What are you doing?

31:21.340 --> 31:23.300
Got it. Next turn's onto Highway 6.

31:23.383 --> 31:25.135
Hanley, Jackson, Chrissy, with me.

31:25.636 --> 31:27.513
-Copy that.
-Copy that.

31:30.349 --> 31:32.142
You said you would get us to safety.

31:32.226 --> 31:34.978
And I will, as soon as
we check out this distress call.

31:35.062 --> 31:36.438
-Let us out.
-In the middle of nowhere?

31:36.522 --> 31:38.732
-Just let us out. Let us out right here!
-Listen--

31:38.815 --> 31:41.693
-Stop the car.
-I am gonna get you to safety.

31:41.777 --> 31:44.446
-We just gotta do this first.
-Why?

31:44.530 --> 31:48.283
I told you. We help people, okay?
It's what we do.

31:58.669 --> 32:00.879
Notify me when submarines are in place.

32:00.963 --> 32:01.964
India's holding.

32:07.386 --> 32:08.387
General.

32:08.470 --> 32:09.471
Madam President,

32:09.555 --> 32:12.224
this directive to bypass
the chain of command is troubling,

32:12.307 --> 32:13.308
to say the least.

32:13.392 --> 32:17.271
Necessary. We have to trust our operators.
We may only have a brief window.

32:17.354 --> 32:21.191
I trust my operators.
It's yours I distrust.

32:21.984 --> 32:24.152
I don't relish ICBMs dropping on my head

32:24.236 --> 32:26.697
because some 20-year-old lacked restraint.

32:30.325 --> 32:33.537
Tell all operators, if they miss,
to detonate in the air.

32:34.204 --> 32:36.039
Let's try not to shoot each other.

32:38.792 --> 32:41.044
-Happy?
-Not particularly.

32:41.628 --> 32:42.629
Well, who is?

32:45.757 --> 32:48.177
Hanley? Jackson? Chrissy? Here we go.

32:49.553 --> 32:50.554
Copy that.

32:51.138 --> 32:52.139
Copy that.

33:04.359 --> 33:06.361
You know? For my 30th birthday,

33:06.445 --> 33:08.739
I had the biggest firework display
in history.

33:08.822 --> 33:09.990
Thirty barges.

33:10.991 --> 33:12.910
They said you could see it from space.

33:15.204 --> 33:16.330
Trended for a week.

33:18.707 --> 33:21.627
Do you still want my clinical evaluation
of your sanity?

33:35.098 --> 33:36.099
You okay?

33:39.353 --> 33:41.021
The last time we fired at themâ€¦

33:45.609 --> 33:47.653
was the last time I heard her voice.

33:52.491 --> 33:53.659
This time's different.

34:03.335 --> 34:05.003
I think you can bury someoneâ€¦

34:08.422 --> 34:09.424
a memoryâ€¦

34:11.342 --> 34:12.344
a feelingâ€¦

34:16.306 --> 34:18.475
But one moment can bring it all back.

34:23.856 --> 34:25.690
What part of my brain is that?

34:28.860 --> 34:29.987
The human part.

34:35.033 --> 34:37.995
Military wants us on the streets
at dawn looking up at the sky.

34:38.078 --> 34:39.621
Some kinda action they got going on.

34:39.705 --> 34:41.706
Okay. Davids, Garcia, saddle up.

34:42.331 --> 34:44.001
-You're riding with me, Wade.
-Sheriff.

34:44.083 --> 34:45.835
Come on. Let's go, Carmichael.

34:46.335 --> 34:48.714
-What's going on?
-Hey, Rosey.

34:48.797 --> 34:51.257
Transport's being held
till whatever they got going on's done.

34:51.341 --> 34:53.135
Think you can watch him
a couple more hours?

34:53.217 --> 34:56.722
Yeah. I'ma stay here.
Get that coffee machine working.

34:56.804 --> 34:58.307
You're a savior, Rosey.

34:58.849 --> 34:59.850
A savior.

35:11.778 --> 35:13.530
All right, open it up.

35:16.491 --> 35:18.452
-You did this?
-No, the kid. The kid that I helped.

35:18.535 --> 35:22.331
He drew it. I mean, he would see things.
See what the aliens would see.

35:22.831 --> 35:24.374
They like comic books like us?

35:24.458 --> 35:26.710
Go a few pages back. Three or four.

35:28.420 --> 35:30.964
There. He drew that over four months ago.

35:31.548 --> 35:33.217
And at first, I thought it was a star.

35:33.300 --> 35:36.261
Like a planet or something,
but don't you recognize it?

35:37.095 --> 35:39.973
That's the same shape
as Sheriff Tyson's badge.

35:42.643 --> 35:43.977
Am I wrong?

35:46.939 --> 35:48.774
Could just be a coincidence.

35:48.857 --> 35:51.527
Go get his flyer, please.

35:57.491 --> 36:00.369
Now check the numbers in the book
and check the date that he was missing.

36:10.212 --> 36:13.006
See? The answers are in there.

36:14.842 --> 36:16.176
They brought me here for a reason.

36:25.477 --> 36:28.105
The answers are here.

36:31.775 --> 36:33.819
We got a family of three stuck in a car.

36:34.945 --> 36:36.363
I counted six aliens.

36:36.947 --> 36:38.448
They're coming from all sides.

36:43.287 --> 36:45.414
Suit up. All the throwers.

36:52.379 --> 36:53.505
Got a family trapped.

36:54.506 --> 36:56.425
Half a dozen aliens pinning them down.

36:59.094 --> 37:00.512
-Ry, you're staying.
-I'm going with you.

37:00.596 --> 37:02.431
-Not this time. Ry!
-No, Dad. I always come--

37:10.397 --> 37:12.316
You're a safe distance.
Nothing's gonna happen to you.

37:12.399 --> 37:13.859
Safe distance?

37:13.942 --> 37:15.485
I gave you my word. I keep my word.

37:18.780 --> 37:20.157
But if things go sidewaysâ€¦

37:25.913 --> 37:26.914
drive away.

37:41.637 --> 37:44.306
-Quick and quiet.
-Copy. Jackson, you're on assist.

37:44.389 --> 37:46.683
-Copy that.
-On my signal.

37:48.018 --> 37:49.019
Go, go, go.

37:53.982 --> 37:56.151
Go, go, go. Guys ready?

37:56.818 --> 37:58.445
Go, go!

38:02.991 --> 38:07.120
The message will broadcast continuously
on all emergency signals for 30 minutes,

38:07.621 --> 38:09.498
or until you give the order to stop.

38:18.632 --> 38:20.843
My fellow global citizens.

38:22.302 --> 38:24.555
Today at 0942 UTC,

38:25.556 --> 38:28.725
the global community will attempt
a coordinated response

38:29.643 --> 38:32.729
to the alien aggressors
who have invaded our world.

38:33.897 --> 38:39.778
For months now, we've been outnumbered,
outflanked, outgunned.

38:41.071 --> 38:43.240
I cannot guarantee that we will succeed.

38:43.866 --> 38:45.117
Load sequence.

38:45.200 --> 38:47.369
-But what I can sayâ€¦
-Loading.

38:47.452 --> 38:50.038
â€¦is we'll try hit them back
where it hurts.

38:51.832 --> 38:54.042
Let them feel a fraction of what we feel.

38:54.543 --> 38:55.794
One more incoming.

38:56.336 --> 38:57.379
Jackson, cover me.

38:57.880 --> 39:00.716
Chrissy, Chrissy. You got eyes on it?
Left! To your left!

39:01.300 --> 39:03.468
My father used to say,

39:03.552 --> 39:06.763
"Never let them see you
with your head bowed."

39:09.766 --> 39:13.061
So I ask you now, to look up.

39:17.274 --> 39:19.526
-Five, fourâ€¦
-Look up.

39:19.610 --> 39:20.819
-Let us no longer fearâ€¦
-Three.

39:20.903 --> 39:23.197
-â€¦the stars and the sky above.
-Two.

39:23.280 --> 39:24.406
One.

39:24.907 --> 39:25.908
Go.

39:28.076 --> 39:29.119
Onboarded.

39:29.703 --> 39:30.704
Hold.

39:30.787 --> 39:31.788
Hold.

39:36.793 --> 39:37.794
Halt.

39:38.879 --> 39:39.880
Now what?

39:42.925 --> 39:43.926
We wait.

39:52.309 --> 39:53.310
Clark!

39:53.393 --> 39:54.853
Behind you! Behind you!

39:56.605 --> 39:58.565
-Clark!
-Ryder! Ryder!

40:00.567 --> 40:03.070
-Mom!
-Ryder, come back!

40:04.738 --> 40:08.200
Hold steady! Zeb's down! Zeb's down!

40:09.326 --> 40:13.747
Mom, please! We have to help them.
We can't leave them like we left Dad!

40:13.830 --> 40:16.667
-That is not what happened!
-It is what happened! It--

40:18.293 --> 40:20.379
Luke, what's wrong?

40:22.339 --> 40:23.799
Luke.

40:23.882 --> 40:24.883
Luke?

40:26.802 --> 40:28.011
Luke!

40:30.639 --> 40:31.640
More are coming.

40:37.896 --> 40:42.067
We got more! Aliens from the west!
Jesus! Where did they come from?

40:42.150 --> 40:43.485
-Luke!
-Throwers on.

40:43.569 --> 40:45.362
-Circle up! Circle up!
-There's too many!

40:45.445 --> 40:46.530
Luke.

40:48.282 --> 40:50.659
-Mom!
-Luke!

40:57.916 --> 41:01.962
Hold on to this, no matter what!
Don't let go! Don't let go!

41:02.921 --> 41:04.089
Mom!

41:21.398 --> 41:23.275
I need you to be right, Nikhil.

41:42.753 --> 41:44.087
Something's happening.

41:45.088 --> 41:48.133
How much longer you reckon
we're supposed to keep doing this?

41:50.093 --> 41:52.095
How the hell am I supposed to know?

41:57.559 --> 41:59.895
-Pull back!
-Stay down! You gotta stay down.

41:59.978 --> 42:01.271
Someone got eyes on it?

42:01.813 --> 42:03.482
We're not dead yet, okay? Come on.

42:11.281 --> 42:12.282
It's happening.

42:14.368 --> 42:15.452
What is that?

42:17.412 --> 42:20.541
Oh, my goodness. The size of it.

42:24.545 --> 42:26.964
Carriers, do you copy? Do you copy?

42:34.054 --> 42:36.431
We have a target.
I repeat, we have a target.

42:36.932 --> 42:38.058
Fire away.

43:04.418 --> 43:06.128
Direct hit! Enemy down.

43:16.889 --> 43:18.390
Oh, yeah!

43:18.974 --> 43:20.559
God, I love winning!

43:24.688 --> 43:27.149
Who's giving me a cuddle?
Who's giving me a cuddle?

43:27.232 --> 43:30.319
That was
the biggest firework show of all time!

43:39.578 --> 43:41.038
Y'all seeing this?

43:46.168 --> 43:47.419
What's happening?

43:48.545 --> 43:49.880
They're dying!

43:50.714 --> 43:52.424
Family's clear!

43:52.508 --> 43:54.760
Let's go! Let's go! Everyone, move out!

44:00.933 --> 44:02.768
Seven of their ships are down.

44:02.851 --> 44:06.396
Four in the Pacific, two in Antarctica,
one in Eastern Russia.

44:08.690 --> 44:11.151
Put in a call. Offer aid.

44:14.863 --> 44:15.948
That's right.

44:17.074 --> 44:18.283
Now you see us.

44:30.546 --> 44:31.880
You did it, Mitsuki.

44:34.091 --> 44:35.759
All right, yeah!

44:55.571 --> 44:56.613
Got ya.

44:57.364 --> 45:00.492
There you go. Okay. Get to that corner.

45:01.994 --> 45:02.995
Hey, there.

45:05.789 --> 45:06.874
I'll get you some food.

45:06.957 --> 45:07.958
Hey.

45:09.084 --> 45:10.085
You did good.

45:11.712 --> 45:12.963
You too.

45:14.464 --> 45:16.133
Go to the vehicles, okay?

45:19.928 --> 45:21.263
Thank you.

45:21.763 --> 45:23.182
-You were good.
-Come on.

45:23.265 --> 45:24.808
I got him, I got him.

45:25.767 --> 45:27.519
Hell you think happened?

45:27.603 --> 45:28.979
The aliens just stopped.

45:29.062 --> 45:31.064
I don't think
we were the only ones fighting.

45:36.278 --> 45:38.488
Sarah. Sarah.

45:39.781 --> 45:41.074
Sarah, Mommy!

45:42.784 --> 45:44.036
Sarah!

45:55.380 --> 45:56.423
Sarah!

45:58.342 --> 45:59.426
Sarah!

46:04.056 --> 46:05.891
-Sarah!
-Sarah!

46:06.600 --> 46:07.601
Mommy!

46:10.521 --> 46:12.564
-Sarah.
-Sarah!
