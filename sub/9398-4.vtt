00:01.167 --> 00:02.566
<i>Previously on</i> One Tree Hill.

00:02.635 --> 00:04.933
I'm not the guy for you, Brooke Davis.

00:05.005 --> 00:07.803
What if I saw someone in the car?

00:07.874 --> 00:09.273
Who?

00:09.342 --> 00:10.604
Keith.

00:10.710 --> 00:12.871
I think I still have feelings for Lucas.

00:12.946 --> 00:15.380
As far as I'm concerned,
this friendship is over.

00:15.448 --> 00:20.317
I will not have a gun-toting junkie
destroy a 17-year-old business.

00:20.387 --> 00:23.151
<i>I need the gun for protection, Karen.</i>

00:23.223 --> 00:24.986
You have Cooper's eyes.

00:25.058 --> 00:27.492
Stay the hell away from my husband.

00:28.128 --> 00:30.528
Well, you're definitely pregnant.

00:31.698 --> 00:34.428
I'm Derek. I guess I'm your brother.

00:34.534 --> 00:37.401
Ellie brought us together.
I want you to have it.

00:37.470 --> 00:39.131
Thank you, Peyton.

00:39.639 --> 00:42.836
I'm gonna find
a really special place for this.

00:46.780 --> 00:50.375
<i>There comes a time</i>
<i>when every life goes off course.</i>

00:51.418 --> 00:55.411
<i>In this desperate moment,</i>
<i>you must choose your direction.</i>

00:58.358 --> 01:00.792
<i>Will you fight to stay on the path?</i>

01:07.767 --> 01:10.565
<i>Will others tell you who you are?</i>

01:21.214 --> 01:23.011
<i>Or will you label yourself?</i>

01:33.960 --> 01:36.292
<i>Will you be haunted by your choice?</i>

01:45.338 --> 01:47.829
<i>Or will you embrace your new path?</i>

01:49.342 --> 01:51.708
- Hey.
<i>- Hey, sis.</i>

01:52.612 --> 01:56.412
<i>Each morning</i>
<i>you choose to move forward.</i>

02:03.790 --> 02:05.951
<i>Or to simply give up.</i>

02:10.229 --> 02:12.027
Who the hell are you?

02:13.366 --> 02:15.061
This is an intervention.

02:16.269 --> 02:19.705
You have a problem, Deb,
and we want you to go back to rehab.

02:19.772 --> 02:21.103
Yeah, Deb.

02:21.708 --> 02:24.006
We're only here because we care.

02:24.277 --> 02:27.041
You invited Dan to my intervention?

02:27.113 --> 02:28.978
Everyone important
in your life must be here

02:29.048 --> 02:30.743
united against your addiction.

02:30.817 --> 02:34.583
So you got four people,
including my sociopath ex-husband.

02:34.654 --> 02:37.885
Oh, yeah. I have a problem, all right.

02:38.558 --> 02:43.052
Mom, we searched the house,
and I found your pills.

02:43.229 --> 02:44.321
It's over.

02:44.397 --> 02:45.796
No, Nathan, my life was over

02:45.865 --> 02:48.766
the day you left me
and decided to marry her.

02:48.835 --> 02:51.099
- It's not their fault.
- Shut up, Karen.

02:51.171 --> 02:53.435
This was all part of your big plan.

02:53.506 --> 02:55.497
You've never forgiven me
for sleeping with Keith.

02:55.575 --> 02:58.908
No, it's me who hasn't forgiven you.
The guy you tried to light on fire.

02:58.978 --> 03:00.468
Okay, okay, listen.

03:00.547 --> 03:03.345
The first step is to admit
that you have a problem.

03:03.416 --> 03:05.782
Shove it up your ass. I know I'm an addict.

03:05.852 --> 03:09.049
Spend a week with these people,
you will be, too.

03:19.566 --> 03:21.761
I think we're making progress.

03:22.869 --> 03:25.269
I told you, I'm not pregnant.

03:26.973 --> 03:28.440
Whatever you say.

03:28.508 --> 03:31.409
But you can't have the baby.
You'd be a terrible mother.

03:31.477 --> 03:33.968
Why would I be a terrible mother?

03:34.047 --> 03:35.878
We all turn into our parents.

03:35.949 --> 03:37.917
I mean, as soon
as Brooke, Jr. Hits puberty,

03:37.984 --> 03:39.576
Brooke, Sr. Hits South Beach.

03:39.652 --> 03:41.017
I will not.

03:41.754 --> 03:44.450
I thought you said you weren't pregnant.

03:45.792 --> 03:47.953
All right, let's shoot this.

03:48.661 --> 03:49.719
All right.

03:49.796 --> 03:52.526
How many "after" photos
does Jenny Craig need, anyway?

03:52.599 --> 03:55.159
This is practice for the <i>Maxim</i> magazine
shoot this afternoon.

03:55.235 --> 03:57.362
They're looking
for Tree Hill's hometown hottie.

03:57.437 --> 04:00.804
Well, why not hometown hussy?
'Cause you've got that one in the bag.

04:00.873 --> 04:02.170
This one, too.

04:02.242 --> 04:03.800
You're my biggest
competition in this town,

04:03.876 --> 04:06.276
and you're packing on baby weight.

04:13.253 --> 04:17.882
So at the party, I told Brooke that
I wasn't going to fight for her anymore.

04:18.391 --> 04:20.052
What did she say?

04:20.793 --> 04:22.351
Pretty much nothing.

04:22.428 --> 04:25.022
You know, it's funny.

04:25.098 --> 04:28.226
For the first time ever,
I feel like it's actually over.

04:29.035 --> 04:30.627
I'm sorry, Luke.

04:31.137 --> 04:32.468
Thank you.

04:33.072 --> 04:36.872
Hey, so tell me, how are things going
with Derek, the instant brother?

04:36.943 --> 04:38.137
Well...

04:39.646 --> 04:41.307
Guess you can ask him yourself.

04:41.381 --> 04:43.508
He's giving us a ride to school.

04:54.193 --> 04:55.524
So I'll see you at lunch,

04:55.595 --> 04:57.529
and we'll hand out flyers
for the show tonight.

04:57.597 --> 04:59.827
Yeah. I mean, are you sure?
'Cause Lucas can help me.

04:59.899 --> 05:02.595
Peyton, until finals, all I got is time.

05:03.136 --> 05:04.228
Cool.

05:04.804 --> 05:06.135
Take care.

05:11.944 --> 05:14.708
Don't you think it's a little weird
that he's always taking pictures of you?

05:14.781 --> 05:16.942
- It's for his photography class.
- Yeah, right.

05:17.016 --> 05:18.483
What's the assignment,
pictures of Peyton's ass?

05:18.551 --> 05:20.985
- Shut up!
- Hidey-ho, neighbors.

05:21.054 --> 05:23.887
Hey! So, how was
the Manson family reunion?

05:25.024 --> 05:27.584
You know, it was kind of like
the end of <i>The Lion King</i>

05:27.660 --> 05:29.821
when all the hyenas gang up and eat Scar.

05:29.896 --> 05:33.457
- How'd Nathan take it?
- He stiffed me on a ride to school.

05:37.370 --> 05:39.270
What do you think?

05:39.906 --> 05:41.737
What? Did you...

05:41.808 --> 05:44.606
- Did you buy a motorcycle?
- No. That's the beauty of it.

05:44.677 --> 05:47.703
I traded the car for the bike,
and I made 200 bucks.

05:47.780 --> 05:50.840
Now we can pay some bills,
and we'll save a ton of money on gas.

05:50.917 --> 05:52.009
Jesus.

05:53.853 --> 05:56.014
Nathan bought a motorcycle.

05:56.089 --> 06:00.458
Well, Rachel
thinks I should have an abortion.

06:00.793 --> 06:02.727
Okay. Yours is worse.

06:10.370 --> 06:12.565
Brooke, hold on.

06:13.005 --> 06:15.906
I'd like to encourage you
to have your baby.

06:16.008 --> 06:17.032
What?

06:17.110 --> 06:18.975
There are several outlets available to you,

06:19.045 --> 06:21.138
should you decide
you're not ready to be a mother.

06:21.214 --> 06:23.409
- Like adoption.
- Okay.

06:23.483 --> 06:26.475
I don't know what you think you heard,
but you heard it wrong because I'm not...

06:26.552 --> 06:27.678
Don't worry, Brooke.

06:27.754 --> 06:30.484
When you're ready to talk, we'll be here.

06:30.990 --> 06:33.788
We're not going to let you
go through this alone.

06:37.697 --> 06:39.392
What does she mean "we"?

06:43.603 --> 06:45.867
I'm glad that you decided to come in.

06:46.305 --> 06:47.772
Well, after your work with Deb, I thought,

06:47.840 --> 06:50.968
"Now, here's a woman
who probably won't help me at all."

06:51.477 --> 06:53.707
Well, let's give it a try, anyway.

06:53.780 --> 06:55.543
What's on your mind?

06:58.851 --> 07:03.049
Everything we say in this room
is completely confidential, right?

07:05.458 --> 07:06.948
I killed my brother.

08:02.081 --> 08:03.105
What's that?

08:03.182 --> 08:05.912
I'm inviting you to join our club
and be a Clean Teen.

08:05.985 --> 08:07.475
Virgins for life.

08:09.755 --> 08:11.245
Virgins for life?

08:11.657 --> 08:14.182
Well, maybe not for life,
but "virgins until marriage"

08:14.260 --> 08:15.989
just didn't sound as good.

08:16.062 --> 08:18.462
What exactly does a Clean Teen do?

08:18.998 --> 08:21.091
Everything you guys do,

08:21.267 --> 08:23.030
except we abstain from sex.

08:23.636 --> 08:26.400
- You're completely celibate?
- Pretty much.

08:26.472 --> 08:28.337
What does "pretty much" mean?

08:28.407 --> 08:31.376
Well, we "Brooke" ourselves.

08:32.010 --> 08:33.342
I'll join.

08:33.746 --> 08:34.837
Okay, listen to me.

08:34.914 --> 08:38.509
Who I am and how I choose
to live my life is none of your business.

08:38.583 --> 08:42.076
- So your decisions are your own, then?
- That's right.

08:42.154 --> 08:43.678
What about your baby's
decision to be born?

08:43.756 --> 08:45.018
What about my decision

08:45.091 --> 08:46.991
I'm making right now
to kick your preachy ass?

08:47.059 --> 08:49.823
Brooke, if you don't want to raise
your baby, someone will.

08:49.896 --> 08:51.761
I'm sorry.

08:51.831 --> 08:55.562
When you "Brooke" yourself,
do you do that alone or is it a group thing?

08:55.635 --> 08:57.500
Because if it's a group thing, I'm totally in.

08:57.570 --> 08:58.764
Rachel!

08:59.605 --> 09:01.402
Okay, Shelly,
I understand that in your world,

09:01.474 --> 09:02.566
everything's black and white,

09:02.642 --> 09:05.042
but real life is just
a little more complicated.

09:05.111 --> 09:06.942
Complicated as in
you don't want to get too fat

09:07.013 --> 09:08.241
to fit into your prom dress?

09:08.314 --> 09:10.111
Why don't you go back
to your group of Clean Teens

09:10.182 --> 09:11.911
and leave me alone?

09:13.619 --> 09:14.813
Fine.

09:17.290 --> 09:19.224
Good luck with your pregnancy.

09:23.829 --> 09:27.094
You say that you killed your brother.
Can you explain that?

09:29.101 --> 09:31.797
I let Keith go into the school that day.

09:32.238 --> 09:34.229
I could have stopped him.

09:34.674 --> 09:36.403
I should have stopped him.

09:37.810 --> 09:40.005
Tell me about you and Keith.

09:40.980 --> 09:43.574
We never got along, not even as kids.

09:43.716 --> 09:46.879
But at least back then,
we always had each other's backs.

09:47.086 --> 09:48.678
When did that change?

10:03.469 --> 10:04.561
Nathan.

10:05.071 --> 10:09.167
- Mom, what are you doing here?
- You have something that belongs to me.

10:10.476 --> 10:11.841
Mom, I'm not doing this.

10:11.911 --> 10:13.742
- We're in the middle of a test.
- I want my pills.

10:13.813 --> 10:15.940
- Mrs. Scott...
- Don't.

10:21.921 --> 10:24.583
I'm not leaving here
till I get my damn pills.

10:26.592 --> 10:27.820
Okay.

10:32.498 --> 10:34.159
Go ahead. Take them.

10:34.233 --> 10:35.996
But I'm warning you,

10:36.469 --> 10:38.596
it's either the pills or me.

10:47.546 --> 10:50.845
Okay, everybody. Back to work.
Back to work.

10:57.523 --> 10:58.717
Hello?

10:59.759 --> 11:01.818
Hey. Great test shot.

11:02.995 --> 11:05.225
So, you ready to be in <i>Maxim?</i>

11:05.765 --> 11:07.027
Definitely.

12:10.029 --> 12:11.223
Nathan.

12:12.531 --> 12:13.691
God!

12:13.766 --> 12:15.791
- What happened?
- It's okay. Don't worry.

12:15.868 --> 12:18.462
These days they can... I don't know,
they can graft skin from my ass.

12:18.537 --> 12:21.404
- Are you hurt anywhere else?
- No, I'm fine.

12:21.474 --> 12:23.908
- Bike's pretty messed up, though.
- Bike, great.

12:23.976 --> 12:28.242
Okay, I want you to get the car back
as soon as you can

12:28.314 --> 12:30.179
because I need you on this planet.

12:30.249 --> 12:32.444
Haley, nothing's going to happen to me.

12:32.518 --> 12:34.418
You are not invincible.

12:36.222 --> 12:37.484
Nathan...

12:38.657 --> 12:40.716
I know that it's really hard
for you to explain

12:40.793 --> 12:43.728
what happened to you
down under that water...

12:44.363 --> 12:46.058
Maybe Keith did save you.

12:46.132 --> 12:48.157
Maybe you saved yourself. I don't know.

12:48.234 --> 12:50.634
But the point is that, either way,

12:50.703 --> 12:53.763
it means that you are supposed
to be here right now.

12:53.839 --> 12:55.636
Hales, that's not it.

12:56.675 --> 12:59.405
My mom came into school today
and in front of everybody,

12:59.478 --> 13:01.912
chose pills over me.

13:05.684 --> 13:06.776
Here.

13:08.687 --> 13:10.279
Where you going?

13:10.656 --> 13:14.422
You take care of the bike, please.
I will take care of your mother.

13:22.535 --> 13:24.230
Stay away from him.

13:24.303 --> 13:27.864
For all I care, you can go to hell,
but I will not let you take Nathan with you.

13:27.940 --> 13:30.374
Talk to me in a few years, Haley,

13:30.442 --> 13:34.469
when your dreams are dead
and your child betrays you.

13:34.980 --> 13:36.948
Then we'll see what kind
of mother you'll be.

13:37.016 --> 13:41.043
No, no, no.
I will never, ever be like you, Deb.

13:41.720 --> 13:45.156
You know,
pretty soon Nathan's going to realize

13:45.224 --> 13:48.921
that playing college basketball's
a lot more fun than playing house.

13:50.462 --> 13:52.453
I'll save you some pills.

13:52.631 --> 13:56.658
Who are you kidding, Deb?
Junkies don't save pills.

14:04.443 --> 14:05.671
Brooke.

14:07.112 --> 14:10.707
- What do you want, Shelly?
- I want to apologize.

14:10.783 --> 14:13.013
I came on a little strong earlier,

14:13.085 --> 14:15.781
and I realized Clean Teens
isn't for everyone.

14:16.255 --> 14:20.351
- So you're really never going to have sex?
- Not until my wedding night.

14:20.426 --> 14:23.827
Why would a guy buy the cow
when he can get the milk for free?

14:24.096 --> 14:27.429
Okay, do you realize that
you just likened yourself to a farm animal,

14:27.499 --> 14:30.059
one that is for sale, no less?

14:30.135 --> 14:32.103
It's not just about that.

14:32.171 --> 14:34.605
It's about keeping our bodies pure.

14:35.040 --> 14:38.498
Have you ever had chlamydia
or gonorrhea?

14:38.577 --> 14:39.976
Not fun.

14:40.079 --> 14:44.846
Burn me at the stake,
but I like boys and I like sex.

14:44.917 --> 14:47.750
- So did I, but...
- "So did l"?

14:48.954 --> 14:50.444
Wait a minute.

14:51.423 --> 14:54.824
You have a virginity club
and you're not even a virgin?

14:55.561 --> 14:59.122
- I am now. I'm a born-again virgin.
- A what?

14:59.198 --> 15:02.167
Just because you make a mistake
doesn't mean you can't start over.

15:02.234 --> 15:04.634
I made a pledge. I recommitted.

15:04.703 --> 15:09.140
Shelly, I hate to break it to you,
but you're either a virgin or you're not.

15:09.208 --> 15:13.235
And a pledge does
not a broken hymen mend. Sorry.

15:13.312 --> 15:16.372
You can't tell me what I believe.
I am a virgin.

15:16.448 --> 15:18.109
You're a hypocrite.

15:18.183 --> 15:21.118
You are walking around here
preaching celibacy to everybody,

15:21.186 --> 15:25.020
and you've already sold your cow
or your milk or whatever.

15:25.190 --> 15:27.454
Well, at least I'm not a baby killer.

15:28.627 --> 15:29.958
I...

15:32.898 --> 15:37.130
I still can't believe I got Lupe Fiasco
to play Tric tonight.

15:37.202 --> 15:39.500
- It's gonna be awesome.
- Yeah, it's great.

15:39.571 --> 15:41.436
Hey, cool jacket.

15:41.507 --> 15:43.771
Thanks. Ellie gave it to me.

15:45.077 --> 15:46.806
Wish I could have met her.

15:47.413 --> 15:49.278
It was tough to trust at first.

15:49.348 --> 15:52.579
You know, having somebody
out there that you're related to.

15:52.651 --> 15:55.779
- Like your long-lost brother?
- Yeah.

15:57.556 --> 16:00.992
- So, did it hurt when you got shot?
- Oh, my God, so bad.

16:01.060 --> 16:03.688
- You got a scar?
- Yeah.

16:03.762 --> 16:05.855
- Oh, is it gross?
- Yes.

16:05.931 --> 16:07.228
- Let me see.
- No!

16:07.299 --> 16:08.698
Come on.
I've never seen a gunshot wound.

16:08.767 --> 16:10.632
- No.
- Especially if it's gross.

16:10.703 --> 16:11.931
Come on.

16:13.105 --> 16:14.197
Fine.

16:18.444 --> 16:20.241
Oh, that is so sweet.

16:21.413 --> 16:24.007
- What?
- Okay, just be still.

16:24.783 --> 16:26.580
You're insane. You know that?

16:26.652 --> 16:29.450
If this ends up on the web,
I'm coming after you.

16:29.888 --> 16:31.378
Tell you what.

16:31.924 --> 16:33.391
Family photo.

16:37.262 --> 16:39.287
Ready? Cheese!

16:40.199 --> 16:42.030
- Two lumps.
- Yeah.

16:44.103 --> 16:47.937
If you're having an intervention,
you can have my heart pills.

16:48.974 --> 16:51.943
I asked Whitey over here to

16:52.411 --> 16:54.879
talk about your playing with the Ravens.

16:54.947 --> 16:58.212
Your mom wants you back on the team.
So do I.

16:58.283 --> 17:00.615
And I talked to the doctor this morning,

17:00.686 --> 17:03.678
and there are some risks,
but it's manageable.

17:08.727 --> 17:10.752
There are two conditions.

17:10.829 --> 17:15.698
You have to stay on your medication,
and we limit you to 15 minutes a night.

17:15.768 --> 17:18.134
I'll be bringing you in off the bench,

17:18.203 --> 17:21.104
but you know that benches
win championships.

17:21.707 --> 17:24.540
Look, I know it's different than last time.

17:25.210 --> 17:27.109
But you'll get to play.

17:27.579 --> 17:28.739
I...

17:31.250 --> 17:32.274
No.

17:33.252 --> 17:34.583
Look, Mom,

17:35.621 --> 17:38.283
I appreciate everything
you're trying to do for me,

17:38.357 --> 17:40.655
and I miss basketball every day,

17:42.027 --> 17:43.927
but to have it halfway,

17:44.763 --> 17:47.391
it's harder than not having it at all.

17:54.473 --> 17:56.065
So, what do you think?

17:56.241 --> 17:59.210
I guess I'm supposed to tell you,
you have too much makeup on,

17:59.278 --> 18:03.578
your skirt's too short, and the boys
are only out for one thing, but

18:03.782 --> 18:05.511
you look beautiful.

18:06.752 --> 18:11.189
Thank you, Peyton, for letting me in,
for trusting me.

18:11.557 --> 18:13.149
It's been great.

18:14.126 --> 18:15.684
Well, then, it's about to get better,

18:15.761 --> 18:18.457
'cause this is something
I haven't told anyone.

18:20.532 --> 18:22.523
Lucas and Brooke are done.

18:22.601 --> 18:26.230
So I've decided I'm going
to tell him how I feel

18:27.072 --> 18:28.300
tonight.

18:59.238 --> 19:02.469
Hey. Please tell me we're going home
on four wheels.

19:02.541 --> 19:06.136
The guy wouldn't give me the car back
because the motorcycle's too messed up.

19:06.211 --> 19:09.942
But look, I'll figure something out, okay?
It just might take me a couple of days.

19:10.015 --> 19:11.482
- Okay.
- All right?

19:11.550 --> 19:13.279
I'm going to get a drink.

19:14.219 --> 19:15.777
Okay, just think about it this way.

19:15.854 --> 19:19.915
Most guys buy a motorcycle because
they're compensating for... You know.

19:19.992 --> 19:21.789
Nathan wears size 14s.

19:21.860 --> 19:24.624
Oh, thanks. I feel so much better now.

19:29.868 --> 19:32.735
Care to make the night interesting?

19:33.038 --> 19:35.632
After the day I've had, yeah, sure.

19:36.341 --> 19:39.242
I've got something for you, too,
by the way.

19:41.413 --> 19:43.176
Somehow

19:44.016 --> 19:46.143
this ended up in my locker.

19:46.218 --> 19:48.243
Hometown hottie, right?

19:48.520 --> 19:50.078
How was the shoot?

19:50.155 --> 19:54.558
Well, you know,
I could let you preview the whole spread.

19:57.329 --> 19:58.853
Thanks for the drink.

20:00.599 --> 20:02.089
Nathan, wait.

20:06.138 --> 20:08.333
What did you see in the water?

20:09.775 --> 20:11.709
You saw something, didn't you?

20:11.777 --> 20:13.768
Why would you say that?

20:14.846 --> 20:16.313
Never mind.

20:25.924 --> 20:27.585
<i>Dan, I asked you</i>

20:27.659 --> 20:30.685
when your relationship
with Keith changed.

20:30.762 --> 20:34.357
I was away at school when I got the call
Karen was in labor.

20:35.567 --> 20:38.502
I drove all night long to be at the hospital.

20:39.605 --> 20:41.869
But she never knew I was there.

20:42.908 --> 20:44.136
Why not?

20:44.576 --> 20:46.874
I only got as far as the door.

20:48.413 --> 20:50.040
What did you see?

20:51.483 --> 20:56.250
Keith at Karen's bedside, holding my son.

20:57.389 --> 20:59.118
How you doing, Son?

21:01.426 --> 21:03.587
What do you mean?
Since the last time you were here

21:03.662 --> 21:05.857
and you threatened to kill me?

21:05.931 --> 21:08.422
Yeah. Sorry about that.

21:09.868 --> 21:11.495
What do you want?

21:12.738 --> 21:15.104
I ever tell you about my final game?

21:15.173 --> 21:17.266
Eighty-seven against Wake Forest.

21:17.542 --> 21:20.102
I was one rebound shy of a double-double.

21:20.178 --> 21:22.305
And then there it was
right on the front of the rim,

21:22.381 --> 21:25.782
and I jumped up for the ball,
came down on my knee.

21:25.851 --> 21:28.081
Right then, I knew it was over.

21:28.487 --> 21:30.352
Oh, I could've rehabbed.

21:30.455 --> 21:34.619
But I decided if I couldn't be the best,
I didn't wanna play the game at all.

21:34.860 --> 21:36.259
I was wrong.

21:37.062 --> 21:40.589
I'd give anything to just be back out
on the court for 15 minutes a night.

21:40.666 --> 21:42.691
Hell, I'd take 15 seconds.

21:43.969 --> 21:45.834
You talked to my mom.

21:46.672 --> 21:48.162
You know what?

21:49.107 --> 21:51.598
It's not just about being the player I was.

21:51.677 --> 21:53.269
It's about my mom.

21:53.345 --> 21:58.044
She's been through a lot,
and I don't want her to worry about me.

21:58.116 --> 22:01.108
Lucas, your mom worries
about you every night.

22:01.420 --> 22:04.116
Game nights might be the only nights
she won't worry

22:04.189 --> 22:07.090
'cause she knows
you'll be doing something you love.

22:13.598 --> 22:15.930
Hey, Billy. Scotch straight up.

22:21.807 --> 22:24.674
What makes you such a tight-ass, Karen?

22:25.277 --> 22:29.213
Is that what happens
when you don't have sex for 17 years?

22:29.481 --> 22:32.848
Look, I know that you are upset
about the intervention,

22:32.918 --> 22:36.513
and I am sorry for the ambush,
but it was the only way.

22:36.588 --> 22:39.853
No, I completely understand.
It's called tough love.

22:39.925 --> 22:42.155
Now, I have some for you.

22:42.894 --> 22:45.920
- You're fired.
- I don't have time for this.

22:45.997 --> 22:48.329
Well, you better get some.

22:48.400 --> 22:50.630
Our partnership at the cafe
was never on paper,

22:50.702 --> 22:55.935
but I am the majority owner of Tric,
which means you can get the hell out.

22:56.308 --> 22:57.798
Right now.

22:59.544 --> 23:03.981
Sorry to ambush you, Karen.
It was the only way.

23:05.417 --> 23:08.147
Now pour the drink or you're fired, too.

23:14.226 --> 23:15.215
Thank you.

23:15.293 --> 23:17.523
Hey, Tree Hill! You guys ready?

23:17.963 --> 23:19.453
All right!

23:20.499 --> 23:23.332
Please welcome Lupe Fiasco!

23:27.806 --> 23:30.001
What up, Tree Hill?

24:43.281 --> 24:44.771
I know about Brooke.

24:46.918 --> 24:50.513
I know Brooke's pregnant.
What are we going to do?

24:51.223 --> 24:52.884
Tell you what.

24:52.958 --> 24:55.950
You drive her to the clinic. I'll pick her up.

24:57.596 --> 24:58.688
Oh, come on.

24:58.763 --> 25:01.926
There's no way Brooke and Lucas
are ready to have a baby.

25:27.359 --> 25:29.418
How great is this?

25:33.265 --> 25:35.961
So I saw Lucas.

25:37.302 --> 25:39.862
Now, Peyton,
there's something you should know.

25:39.938 --> 25:41.599
Brooke's pregnant.

25:42.541 --> 25:43.803
She can't be.

25:44.209 --> 25:45.574
Are you sure?

25:45.644 --> 25:50.513
Yeah, I heard that angry kid, Mouth,
talking to your friend Rachel.

25:51.349 --> 25:54.045
- Well, I have to go talk to Lucas.
- Peyton...

25:55.820 --> 26:00.416
The other night at Rachel's party,
I overheard Lucas talking to Brooke.

26:01.259 --> 26:04.990
He said if she'd take him back,
he'd never talk to you again.

26:06.331 --> 26:07.798
He said that?

26:08.600 --> 26:10.124
I'm sorry.

26:11.036 --> 26:14.096
I guess Lucas isn't the guy you think he is.

26:23.448 --> 26:26.110
Hey, can I talk to you for a second?

26:41.800 --> 26:43.097
Okay...

26:43.702 --> 26:47.536
- Have you talked to Brooke today?
- No. Why?

26:48.206 --> 26:52.006
There's a rumor going around
about her that she's pregnant.

26:54.012 --> 26:55.639
I know you said you're not
going to fight for her,

26:55.714 --> 26:58.547
but if she is pregnant,
then you need to be there for her.

26:58.617 --> 26:59.811
I got to go find her.

26:59.884 --> 27:02.717
So, I guess this is goodbye, then?

27:03.288 --> 27:04.880
Well, what do you mean?

27:05.156 --> 27:07.647
Derek told me what you said
to Brooke at the party.

27:07.726 --> 27:10.024
Okay. Wait. What did I say?

27:12.530 --> 27:15.260
You need to talk to Brooke. I can wait.

27:29.180 --> 27:32.547
Clean Teens.
More like mean teens with big mouths.

27:32.617 --> 27:34.915
Did you know they told everyone?

27:35.220 --> 27:37.154
Actually, that was me.

27:37.389 --> 27:39.448
Why would you do that?

27:39.524 --> 27:41.549
This coming from the girl
who put up posters of me

27:41.626 --> 27:44.356
circa 200 pounds all over school?

27:44.429 --> 27:46.294
Consider it payback.

27:46.364 --> 27:48.127
See you at home, roommate.

27:51.670 --> 27:54.639
- Is it true?
- Oh, that didn't take long.

27:54.706 --> 27:57.300
Luke, I told you I wasn't pregnant.

27:57.375 --> 28:00.538
- All right, do you think I would lie to you?
- It wouldn't be the first time.

28:00.612 --> 28:05.072
No, the first time, actually,
I lied and said I was pregnant.

28:05.150 --> 28:07.084
Also, the first time,

28:07.152 --> 28:09.382
you were sneaking around
behind my back with Peyton.

28:09.454 --> 28:11.854
- Brooke, this is my decision, too.
- Really?

28:11.923 --> 28:15.188
As though you're the only guy
I've ever slept with.

28:17.028 --> 28:19.792
- Chris Keller.
- I...

28:21.332 --> 28:24.267
Unbelievable. You know what?
Don't talk to me.

28:54.165 --> 28:56.292
Lupe's pretty great, huh?

28:57.502 --> 28:59.493
So, what did you tell Peyton I said?

28:59.571 --> 29:01.937
- What?
- At the party.

29:02.006 --> 29:04.497
Apparently you heard
Brooke and me talking.

29:04.843 --> 29:06.435
What did I say, Derek?

29:06.678 --> 29:10.876
Look, all I said was if you're
getting back together with Brooke,

29:10.949 --> 29:14.749
you'd have less time to spend with Peyton.
That's all.

29:16.621 --> 29:19.988
I got no problem with you, Luke.
You're a cool guy, man.

29:41.412 --> 29:42.777
Hey, Brooke.

29:48.620 --> 29:49.814
Glenda?

29:50.588 --> 29:52.488
Yeah, I'm trying something new.

29:52.557 --> 29:55.890
Yeah, you look good in black.

29:55.960 --> 30:02.024
- Thanks. So, you know Shelly?
- Oh, not exactly.

30:02.100 --> 30:05.035
I don't really hang out with "fake" virgins.

30:05.103 --> 30:09.403
Yeah, you know what sucks about
that whole born-again virginity thing?

30:10.441 --> 30:12.136
I am a virgin,

30:12.210 --> 30:15.805
and Shelly was, like, the biggest slut
at church camp last summer.

30:15.947 --> 30:18.882
Wait a minute.
You hung out with Shelly last summer?

30:18.950 --> 30:20.383
Well, not all summer.

30:20.451 --> 30:23.477
Shelly's parents came
and got her halfway through.

30:24.923 --> 30:26.151
Really?

30:45.944 --> 30:48.606
So have you heard? About Brooke?

30:48.680 --> 30:51.410
Nathan, I don't think
this is the place to talk.

30:51.482 --> 30:53.416
You knew about it, didn't you?

30:55.486 --> 30:57.477
You remember that fight we had
about birth control?

30:57.555 --> 30:58.988
Yeah, how could I forget it?

30:59.057 --> 31:01.525
Brooke and Lucas both heard
that entire thing.

31:01.593 --> 31:02.992
I mean, you'd think
after something like that,

31:03.061 --> 31:04.688
they'd use two condoms.

31:05.830 --> 31:09.596
- And how could she just not tell him?
- Because she's scared to death.

31:09.667 --> 31:10.964
Yeah, she should be.

31:11.035 --> 31:14.562
I mean, how do you just tell a guy
that his life is over?

31:36.327 --> 31:37.726
Hey, Shelly.

31:39.497 --> 31:41.488
What happened last summer?

31:42.667 --> 31:44.760
I don't know what you're talking about.

31:44.836 --> 31:47.737
I know your parents
picked you up from camp.

31:54.779 --> 31:56.269
What happened?

31:59.851 --> 32:01.842
You don't think about it.

32:04.289 --> 32:07.122
You meet a cute boy
and you're having fun.

32:10.161 --> 32:11.492
I couldn't tell my parents.

32:11.562 --> 32:14.190
I mean, you don't get pregnant
at church camp.

32:15.867 --> 32:19.166
Brooke, you have to have your baby, okay?
You have to.

32:21.039 --> 32:23.337
You had an abortion, didn't you?

32:23.641 --> 32:25.939
You can't take it back.

32:26.010 --> 32:27.739
You think it's gonna
make everything better,

32:27.812 --> 32:29.336
but it doesn't.

32:31.182 --> 32:33.980
- You can never take it back.
- Shelly.

32:48.599 --> 32:50.191
<i>Are you still in love with Karen?</i>

32:54.939 --> 32:56.031
Maybe.

32:58.076 --> 33:01.477
<i>So, in a way, now that</i>
<i>your brother's gone, you've won.</i>

33:03.247 --> 33:05.738
<i>Maybe that's why you feel so guilty.</i>

33:08.820 --> 33:10.048
Brooke!

33:12.357 --> 33:15.190
Where have you been?
I've been looking everywhere for you.

33:15.259 --> 33:17.523
Hello, Haley James Scott.

33:19.530 --> 33:21.191
Are you drinking?

33:21.699 --> 33:23.360
Why wouldn't I be?

33:23.501 --> 33:26.095
Tree Hill High thinks I'm a slut,

33:26.170 --> 33:28.900
Lucas thinks I'm giving birth
to Chris Keller the second,

33:28.973 --> 33:34.036
and my gossipy roommate
thinks that I'd make a terrible mother.

33:34.112 --> 33:35.739
And she's right.

33:36.280 --> 33:38.043
Okay, I'm just going
to take you home, okay?

33:38.116 --> 33:39.105
No.

33:41.486 --> 33:43.386
I can't do this, Haley.

33:44.522 --> 33:46.717
I can't be pregnant anymore.

33:51.629 --> 33:53.221
We need to talk.

33:53.931 --> 33:55.262
Then talk.

33:56.034 --> 33:57.296
Not here.

33:59.871 --> 34:02.362
Thanks to your flask, I'm walking.

34:03.207 --> 34:04.799
Nathan.

34:04.876 --> 34:07.811
I really need to talk to you
about the accident.

34:09.514 --> 34:10.708
Please.

34:11.748 --> 34:13.774
Tell you what. I'll drive.

34:15.386 --> 34:18.514
I left my helmet upstairs,
and you don't even have one.

34:18.589 --> 34:20.887
I won't tell if you won't.

35:03.634 --> 35:05.397
Tonight was amazing.

35:06.671 --> 35:08.263
You did a great job.

35:08.906 --> 35:12.205
I'm sorry things with Lucas
didn't go as well as you planned.

35:12.276 --> 35:14.767
- You want to kill the messenger?
- No.

35:14.846 --> 35:18.009
No, God knows if we did that in this town
every time somebody got pregnant,

35:18.082 --> 35:19.242
there'd be nobody left.

35:19.317 --> 35:22.081
Well, don't take it too hard
about Lucas and Brooke.

35:22.153 --> 35:24.553
There's a guy out there for you, Peyton.

35:24.655 --> 35:25.986
I know it.

35:26.424 --> 35:27.618
Thanks.

35:28.759 --> 35:30.090
Come here.

35:37.702 --> 35:39.897
- So, see you later?
- Yeah.

35:40.872 --> 35:42.169
Bye.

35:45.510 --> 35:46.499
Hey.

35:46.577 --> 35:49.944
- Did you talk to Brooke? Is it true?
- I don't know yet.

35:50.014 --> 35:52.505
Listen, what did Derek exactly say to you
about me and Brooke?

35:52.583 --> 35:56.280
- That's so not important.
- No, no, no. I need to know.

35:57.722 --> 36:00.623
He said he heard you say
you would cut me out of your life

36:00.691 --> 36:03.626
if she would take you back. And it's fine.
Luke, I get it, okay?

36:03.694 --> 36:05.594
Oh, my God.
Peyton, I would never say that.

36:05.663 --> 36:07.995
I would never cut you out of my life.

36:08.065 --> 36:10.499
Look, how much
do you know about Derek?

36:10.835 --> 36:13.804
I mean, if he would lie about this,
I wonder what else he's lying about.

36:13.871 --> 36:15.236
You know what? Maybe he's not lying.

36:15.306 --> 36:17.433
Maybe that's just what
he thought he heard you say.

36:17.508 --> 36:20.033
- Peyton.
- Luke, come on.

36:20.111 --> 36:21.840
You're the one that told me
to be more trusting,

36:21.913 --> 36:23.938
so don't ruin this for me.

36:29.720 --> 36:32.951
Great. My jacket, it's gone.

36:33.424 --> 36:37.053
- Well, maybe you left it backstage.
- No, I left it here.

36:37.128 --> 36:39.255
Somebody... Somebody took it.

36:42.567 --> 36:44.558
Ellie gave me that jacket.

36:47.672 --> 36:50.937
<i>There comes a time</i>
<i>when every life goes off course.</i>

36:51.275 --> 36:55.109
<i>In this desperate moment,</i>
<i>who will you be?</i>

37:03.254 --> 37:05.586
I thought maybe you'd be at Tric.

37:06.257 --> 37:08.122
Yeah. Deb fired me.

37:08.559 --> 37:10.424
Fire is her specialty.

37:12.063 --> 37:13.553
Sorry.

37:14.398 --> 37:17.890
I talked to Lucas.
I don't know if I got through.

37:17.969 --> 37:21.769
Maybe the only thing I can give him
is an example not to follow.

37:22.873 --> 37:26.240
You just summed up
my whole parenting strategy.

37:27.111 --> 37:30.205
I just thought you should know.
Good night.

37:30.982 --> 37:33.212
- Dan.
- Yeah?

37:34.819 --> 37:36.810
Would you like some coffee?

37:38.756 --> 37:40.348
That'd be great.

37:41.158 --> 37:43.888
<i>Will you let down your defenses</i>

37:45.463 --> 37:48.296
<i>and find solace in someone unexpected?</i>

37:49.133 --> 37:50.725
Why are we here?

37:53.604 --> 37:56.266
I wasn't honest with you, Nathan.

37:58.709 --> 38:01.678
I do remember something
from the accident.

38:02.580 --> 38:04.878
Something I saw in the water.

38:05.716 --> 38:08.651
What is it, Rachel? What did you see?

38:09.787 --> 38:11.084
Keith.

38:17.128 --> 38:18.755
Tough night, huh?

38:21.365 --> 38:22.855
Stupid rumors.

38:25.002 --> 38:26.094
Brooke,

38:27.438 --> 38:30.236
the other night at the party,
you and Rachel thought I was asleep,

38:30.308 --> 38:31.741
but I wasn't.

38:32.376 --> 38:33.843
I heard you talking,

38:34.178 --> 38:37.443
and I know Rachel thinks
you shouldn't have this baby,

38:37.515 --> 38:39.107
but she's wrong.

38:40.217 --> 38:42.879
You are going to make a great mother.

38:42.953 --> 38:44.614
I honestly believe that.

38:48.592 --> 38:50.150
<i>Will you reach out?</i>

38:53.331 --> 38:55.231
I need to tell you something.

38:56.434 --> 38:58.561
I need to tell you something.

39:00.371 --> 39:01.838
Is it true

39:03.207 --> 39:04.469
about Brooke?

39:04.542 --> 39:09.036
Oh, don't be mad at Brooke.
She's been a great friend.

39:10.648 --> 39:13.242
It's just...
I can't believe she wouldn't tell me.

39:13.317 --> 39:15.182
Luke, it's not Brooke.

39:17.521 --> 39:18.886
It's me.

39:20.624 --> 39:22.091
I'm pregnant.

39:27.064 --> 39:29.692
Nathan's just been working really hard,

39:30.267 --> 39:33.327
and all of his dreams are so close,
and this...

39:33.938 --> 39:35.997
This just changes everything.

39:36.073 --> 39:39.975
Well, Nathan isn't Dan. He'll understand.

39:41.879 --> 39:43.779
I'm really scared, Luke.

39:48.519 --> 39:50.384
It's going to be okay.

39:52.089 --> 39:53.681
How do you know that?

39:53.891 --> 39:56.985
'Cause this kid's
going to have a great uncle.

39:58.195 --> 39:59.890
I learned from the best.

40:01.999 --> 40:04.661
<i>Will you face your greatest fears bravely</i>

40:14.545 --> 40:17.605
<i>and move forward with faith?</i>

40:22.720 --> 40:25.712
<i>Or will you succumb</i>
<i>to the darkness in your soul?</i>

40:27.258 --> 40:29.988
You got it bad, don't you, baby?

40:46.076 --> 40:47.737
Well, here you go.

40:49.680 --> 40:51.204
One more thing.

40:54.785 --> 40:55.945
Kinky.

41:11.335 --> 41:12.393
Perfect.

42:19.103 --> 42:20.092
