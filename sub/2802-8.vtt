00:07.466 --> 00:08.884
PETER: That was a tough case.

00:08.967 --> 00:10.886
It was a multimillion dollar
embezzlement scam.

00:10.969 --> 00:13.388
And I'll give that to you,
but all you gotta do is follow the money.

00:13.472 --> 00:15.390
Look, I'll show you.
Do you have a quarter?

00:15.474 --> 00:16.892
-Will I get it back?
-Depends.

00:16.975 --> 00:18.018
If it disappears, can you find it?

00:18.101 --> 00:20.687
-What are you, a party clown?
-Embezzling your quarter.

00:20.771 --> 00:22.731
There's a crime in progress. Solve it.

00:27.110 --> 00:28.695
It's in your right pant pocket.

00:28.779 --> 00:30.739
You didn't make the switch
with your right hand. Case closed.

00:30.822 --> 00:32.950
-How'd you know?
-Because I kept my eye on the quarter.

00:33.033 --> 00:34.618
See? All you gotta do is follow the money.

00:34.701 --> 00:37.454
You're brilliant,
but we've got a new case. Neal.

00:40.082 --> 00:41.291
Thank you.

00:44.837 --> 00:46.755
Since when do we handle murders?

00:46.839 --> 00:49.299
Since it's linked to corporate espionage.

00:49.383 --> 00:52.427
-The victim worked for Novice Systems.
-Tech firm?

00:52.511 --> 00:55.764
Yeah. They manufacture everything
from cell phones to supercomputers.

00:56.390 --> 00:58.600
Meet Joseph Hayes.

00:58.684 --> 01:00.769
He was Novice's lead R&D specialist.

01:00.853 --> 01:03.230
-Dropped dead of a heart attack.
-DIANA: What was he carrying?

01:03.313 --> 01:06.233
A next-gen quantum microprocessor.

01:06.316 --> 01:07.651
-Anybody know what that is?
-Sure.

01:07.734 --> 01:10.195
Yeah. It's a very small…

01:10.279 --> 01:12.614
-Tool for binary code breaking.
-…tool.

01:12.698 --> 01:16.368
Novice was vying for a defense contract
with several competitors.

01:16.451 --> 01:20.330
According to their PR,
Hayes had a functioning prototype,

01:20.414 --> 01:22.499
which put them in the lead
of that competition.

01:22.583 --> 01:25.127
NEAL: How do we know he was murdered?
JONES: Toxicology report.

01:25.210 --> 01:27.087
It says there was digitalis
in his bloodstream.

01:27.171 --> 01:29.548
PETER: Somebody killed him
and stole the prototype.

01:29.631 --> 01:33.969
-DIANA: Any suspects?
-Wesley Kent, founder and CEO.

01:34.052 --> 01:36.388
He's pointing fingers at his competitors.

01:36.471 --> 01:39.349
But according to NYPD,
he had an after-hours meeting

01:39.433 --> 01:42.019
on his calendar with Hayes,
the night that he died.

01:42.102 --> 01:45.647
His initial statement contradicted
the timeline from the coroner's report.

01:45.731 --> 01:47.482
I other words, Kent's hiding something.

01:47.566 --> 01:51.195
Looks like it. That's why I'm sending
someone in undercover to the company.

01:52.112 --> 01:54.114
I know a bit about
corporate culture, so…

01:54.198 --> 01:55.282
Sit down.

01:55.365 --> 01:59.286
Novice has its annual audit scheduled
for the beginning of next week.

01:59.369 --> 02:03.248
It's a perfect opportunity for us
to get the access we haven't been allowed.

02:03.332 --> 02:06.710
Kent is expecting an accountant
from Bainfield Financial

02:06.793 --> 02:08.128
to show up at his offices.

02:08.212 --> 02:09.838
Well, if I'm not going in, who is?

02:12.966 --> 02:15.761

02:15.844 --> 02:18.722
I thought you joined the FBI
to avoid number crunching.

02:18.805 --> 02:20.599
Glad your accounting degree
hasn't gone to waste.

02:20.682 --> 02:24.603
I was recruited
by several Fortune 500 companies.

02:24.686 --> 02:27.147
-Single or double Windsor?
-Single.

02:27.231 --> 02:29.483
It's hard to picture you
at a big financial firm.

02:29.566 --> 02:31.610
-Been a life changer.
-That's true.

02:31.693 --> 02:33.820
Some alternate universe,
you'd be wearing power ties,

02:33.904 --> 02:36.156
doing power lunches,
flying corporate jets.

02:36.240 --> 02:38.325
-Doubt we'd have ever met.
-Well, maybe.

02:38.408 --> 02:40.118
-Under different circumstances.
-Well, that's true.

02:40.202 --> 02:42.412
-You might've robbed the company.
-Yeah.

02:42.496 --> 02:43.956
You could've had a mansion.

02:44.039 --> 02:45.624

No. No regrets.

02:59.680 --> 03:00.931
Bainfield putting you up?

03:01.014 --> 03:05.561
Yeah. Company booked me
in a suite at a four-star hotel.

03:05.644 --> 03:08.230
-Hmm. Impressive.
-Yeah.

03:08.313 --> 03:11.775
Almost as impressive as your getting
Kate's flight recorder data.

03:11.859 --> 03:13.986
That's right. Sara told me.

03:14.069 --> 03:15.988
Neal, if you're working on this, so am I.

03:16.071 --> 03:18.657
-I'm not working on anything.
-Which means Mozzie's working on it.

03:18.740 --> 03:21.493
I want somebody from my team involved.

03:21.577 --> 03:23.203
-Peter, he is not…
-No protests.

are expense reports
from your senior staff.

The day Hayes died, someone
tried to access his office desktop.

They tried variations on his birthday,
a bunch of song titles,

10:23.624 --> 10:24.625
can access any e-mail account
that they want.

10:43.852 --> 10:48.023
that maybe he'd hire a friend of mine
who's looking for work in marketing.

10:48.106 --> 10:50.192
If I pull the strings,
you think you can land the job?

10:50.275 --> 10:51.360
Marketing?

10:52.903 --> 10:53.904
I can do marketing.

10:54.780 --> 10:56.281
I had Westen Farms conduct a poll

10:56.365 --> 10:58.951
on what people found aesthetically
pleasing in their cereal bowls.

10:59.034 --> 11:00.202
You know what people like to see?

11:00.285 --> 11:01.995
-What?
-Raisins.

11:02.079 --> 11:03.455
(CHUCKLES) Raisins?

11:03.539 --> 11:05.374
Well, a finite amount of raisins.

11:05.457 --> 11:07.376
Market research gave us the key formula.

11:07.459 --> 11:09.461
Six to one flake-to-raisin ratio.

11:09.545 --> 11:12.089
I made sure every box we packaged
met that standard.

11:12.172 --> 11:14.049
-Sales went through the roof.
-Wow.

11:14.132 --> 11:16.760
That's how you got this job?
Breakfast cereal?

11:16.844 --> 11:20.013
Well, ready-to-eat cereal market,
$10.7 billion last year.

11:20.097 --> 11:22.766
Ha-ha. Right.
With the little plastic prizes in the box.

11:22.850 --> 11:25.853
Yeah. That's billion with a B.

11:25.936 --> 11:28.772
But tech's where it's at, dog.
That's why I want to talk to you guys.

11:28.856 --> 11:30.440
You know? Get some pointers.

11:30.524 --> 11:32.401
Want to grab some drinks later?

11:32.484 --> 11:35.112
Oh, well, we've already booked
a dinner at Drayton's, so…

11:35.195 --> 11:37.114
-Oh, you should come.
-Jessica.

11:37.197 --> 11:38.866
Screw you, Trent. Andrew?

11:38.949 --> 11:40.033
-Yeah, fine with me.
-See?

11:40.117 --> 11:42.327
Fine. You can play the game.

11:42.411 --> 11:44.204
-He can play the game, right?
-What's the game?

11:44.288 --> 11:47.249
It's a little tradition we have here.
It's called credit card roulette.

11:47.332 --> 11:49.042
Go out. Run up a nice tab.

11:49.126 --> 11:52.254
Throw all our company cards on the table,
and let the server pick one.

11:52.337 --> 11:53.463
And that card foots the bill.

11:53.547 --> 11:55.507
It blows your dinner budget for the month.

11:55.591 --> 11:58.635
-You up for it?
-(CLICKS TONGUE) Lock and load, Trent.

11:58.719 --> 12:02.055
Mr. Danbury. George.
The auditor would like to see you.

12:02.139 --> 12:03.265
He spoke to Accounting

12:03.348 --> 12:05.309
and has some questions
about your 2009 W2s.

12:05.392 --> 12:08.687
Uh-oh. Excuse me. See you guys later.

12:11.607 --> 12:14.151
-I don't like him.
-You don't like anyone, Trent.

12:14.234 --> 12:16.403
-I like Andrew.
-Because I owe you money, Trent.

12:16.486 --> 12:17.696

You are stepping up in the world.

12:27.956 --> 12:29.541
Well, it's not really my office.

12:29.625 --> 12:31.919
-Oh, can it be mine?
-You already have a workspace.

12:32.002 --> 12:34.421
Oh, yeah, I get a cubicle.
You get a palace.

12:34.505 --> 12:35.881
-I work harder.
-Yeah.

12:35.964 --> 12:39.384
Hat. How's the Marketing department?

12:39.468 --> 12:41.845
Oh, a nice blend of smarmy and suspicious.

12:41.929 --> 12:43.430
I'll narrow it down later.

12:43.514 --> 12:45.015
I'm meeting everyone for dinner tonight.

12:45.098 --> 12:46.183
Oh.

12:46.892 --> 12:49.937
-Espresso?
-I've always liked espresso.

12:50.020 --> 12:51.605
No more ugly FBI mugs for you.

12:52.606 --> 12:54.274
I think you missed your calling.

12:54.358 --> 12:56.235
Tiny cup, big office, expensive suits.

12:56.318 --> 12:58.612
-Ugly mugs are fine.
-Don't fight your instincts, Peter.

12:58.695 --> 13:00.113
-Embrace your true self.
-You done?

13:00.197 --> 13:01.949
-I can keep going.
-You're done.

13:02.783 --> 13:05.619
-What time is dinner tonight?
-9:00. What are you thinking?

13:05.702 --> 13:09.081
If we do have a mole,
we might be able to bait him.

13:09.164 --> 13:11.875
-You're pretty good at chitchat, right?
-Want me to spread some gossip?

13:11.959 --> 13:15.587
Tell everyone that you noticed
I was looking into Hayes' files.

13:15.671 --> 13:17.798
Maybe I found something interesting.

13:17.881 --> 13:19.633
Let him think you found something
on the dead guy,

13:19.716 --> 13:21.218
our mole will wanna
poke around your office.

13:21.301 --> 13:22.678
Yeah, make him come to us.

13:25.597 --> 13:27.015
I'm on it.

13:27.975 --> 13:30.185
TRENT: How much was the smoked squab?

13:30.269 --> 13:32.396
ANDREW: More than
the lobster tartine, Trent.

13:32.479 --> 13:34.398
Which is why I had to raise you
with the Opus.

13:34.481 --> 13:36.066
Uh… Three bottles of Opus.

13:36.149 --> 13:38.861
No matter who loses, someone's
gonna have to answer to Accounting.

13:38.944 --> 13:41.113
-Or Kent himself.
-I haven't met him yet.

13:41.196 --> 13:42.990
Look, the only thing
you need to know about the boss

13:43.073 --> 13:46.118
is that he likes the high life almost
as much as he likes quarterly profits.

13:46.201 --> 13:48.078
ANDREW: And he also likes
his daily Armagnac.

13:48.161 --> 13:51.748
Buying him a bottle every now and then
will help you stay on his good side.

13:51.832 --> 13:53.375
Thanks for the tip.

13:53.458 --> 13:54.918
So, uh, what's up with the hat?

13:55.002 --> 13:58.505
Oh. That's just my humble assault
on the commonplace.

13:58.589 --> 14:00.507
-ANDREW: I like it.
-Kind of weird.

14:00.591 --> 14:03.302
So, um, what happened with Joseph Hayes?

14:05.721 --> 14:08.599
He was head of R&D, right?
He was working on the quantum processor.

14:09.725 --> 14:11.643
I mean, somebody told me he was murdered.

14:11.727 --> 14:13.854
Uh, why do you care?

14:13.937 --> 14:16.815
Oh, when I was in auditor's office,
Hayes' file was on his desk.

14:16.899 --> 14:18.525
Why is the auditor looking into Hayes?

14:18.609 --> 14:20.777
I don't know. He had all your files too.

14:21.528 --> 14:23.155
-Are you serious?
-NEAL: Yeah.

14:23.238 --> 14:24.531

Oh, I'm not looking. I'm not looking.

You do the honors?

Hey, pick a winner, honey.

George, hey. Heh. You surprised me.

Really? You don't like surprises?

(CHUCKLES)

15:41.525 --> 15:43.819
-What are you doing here?
-Working late.

15:45.320 --> 15:46.572
What about you?

15:46.655 --> 15:48.532
What are you doing
in the auditor's office?

15:56.248 --> 15:58.292
You told me the auditor
was looking into us.

15:58.375 --> 16:00.836
I don't like anyone looking into my life,
personally or professionally.

16:01.795 --> 16:04.882
It's a little hypocritical considering
your current position, don't you think?

16:04.965 --> 16:07.634
You said you were working late.
What is it you're working on, George?

16:07.718 --> 16:10.429
I needed to see R&D's field studies
on the new product launch.

16:10.512 --> 16:11.972
Oh, those are on Records on 12.

16:12.055 --> 16:13.599
-Twelve? Got it.
-Mmm.

16:14.892 --> 16:17.477
So, uh, why didn't you call security?
You could've reported me.

16:18.437 --> 16:20.522
I'm here after hours.
I could be up to anything.

16:21.815 --> 16:23.400
Which means
you could probably report me too.

Well… I won't tell if you won't.

put in its bid for the defense contract?

18:06.712 --> 18:07.921

she's spying for one of their competitors.

21:49.142 --> 21:50.936
Thanks, appreciate it.

21:51.019 --> 21:53.647
WOMAN: Novice Communications.
How may I direct your call?

22:11.456 --> 22:13.083
-Hey.
-How are you doing today?

22:13.166 --> 22:14.251
Good.

22:17.129 --> 22:20.090
Jessica is putting together
intel on Wesley Kent.

22:20.174 --> 22:22.593
She's digging
into his travel arrangements.

22:22.676 --> 22:25.888
-What does she want with the CEO?
-He could be another target.

22:25.971 --> 22:27.347
Jones got our warrant.

22:27.431 --> 22:30.475
He's gonna get ahold of me
as soon as he gets to White Plains.

22:30.559 --> 22:33.020
We find anything incriminating,
I'm bringing her down.

22:33.103 --> 22:34.646
(ELEVATOR BELL DINGS)

22:34.730 --> 22:37.482
-Where are you headed?
-Oh, business lunch.

22:41.528 --> 22:42.571
NEAL: Hey.

22:42.654 --> 22:45.032
All right, let's make this quick.
I need to get back to the office.

22:45.115 --> 22:47.784
Hmm. First week,
and you're already a corporate shill?

22:47.868 --> 22:50.162
My condolences
on your recently departed integrity.

22:50.245 --> 22:53.290
-How did it go with Diana?
-I saw some sheet music in her briefcase.

22:53.373 --> 22:55.083
Maybe she's learning the violin.

22:55.167 --> 22:59.087
It was Mozart's <i>Piano Sonata No. 2 in F</i>
from 1775.

22:59.171 --> 23:00.797
The year the music box was made.

23:00.881 --> 23:02.424
-Need I go on?
-I'm sure you will.

23:02.508 --> 23:06.094
I will. There's no historical record
of what song it's playing.

23:06.178 --> 23:08.931
The only way she would know it's Mozart
is if she's heard it.

23:09.973 --> 23:12.142
Peter trusts Diana and I trust him.

23:12.226 --> 23:14.853
Hmm. Could be something, could be nothing.

23:14.937 --> 23:17.022
I just thought you should know.

23:17.105 --> 23:18.607
Also, you got a tail.

23:18.690 --> 23:20.567
Yeah, I noticed a couple blocks back.

23:20.651 --> 23:24.196
Listen, I'll worry about my shadow.
In the meantime, stay close to Diana.

23:24.279 --> 23:26.657
Why don't I just go have coffee
with Hughes while I'm at it?

23:26.740 --> 23:28.242
You're a hero, Mozz.

23:49.555 --> 23:50.556
Jessica.

23:51.515 --> 23:54.893
-Who do you work for? You work with Kent?
-No, no, I'm with the FBI.

23:55.477 --> 23:57.646
I was sent in to find out
if you murdered Joseph Hayes.

23:57.729 --> 23:59.982
-I didn't murder Joseph.
-Then who did?

24:00.607 --> 24:02.067
That's what I wanna find out.

24:09.533 --> 24:11.743
Your handgun was registered
to Joseph Hayes.

24:11.827 --> 24:12.995
You wanna explain that?

24:14.079 --> 24:16.123
-Joseph and I were close.
-You were seeing each other?

24:16.206 --> 24:19.293
Yes, but we couldn't tell anyone.

24:19.376 --> 24:21.420
What do you know
about the project he was working on?

24:21.503 --> 24:23.422
-The microprocessor?
-Mmm-hmm.

24:23.505 --> 24:25.340
He said he was close
to a functioning prototype.

24:25.424 --> 24:27.718
Kent claimed the prototype
was already working.

24:27.801 --> 24:28.802
He lied.

24:32.055 --> 24:33.682
Let's focus on you for a second.

24:33.765 --> 24:36.101
Why did you break
into Hayes' e-mail account?

24:36.185 --> 24:37.644
Rummage through his desktop?

24:37.728 --> 24:41.815
The day before he was murdered,
Joseph was acting… different.

24:41.899 --> 24:43.442
He said someone was following him.

24:43.525 --> 24:45.569
He said not to tell anyone
anything about what I knew,

24:45.652 --> 24:46.653
then gave me the gun.

24:46.737 --> 24:49.489
And you started playing detective?

24:49.573 --> 24:51.491
Kent murdered someone
I care about very much,

24:51.575 --> 24:53.327
and I would do anything
to make sure he pays.

24:53.410 --> 24:55.787
Look, he's been taking trips, okay?

24:55.871 --> 24:57.998
By himself, under the guise of business.

24:58.081 --> 25:00.375
Eastern Europe, China, no one knows why.

25:00.459 --> 25:01.793
You were trying to find out?

25:01.877 --> 25:04.129
I was trying to get into Kent's office.

25:04.213 --> 25:06.215
I've been seeing garbage bins
coming out of there.

25:06.298 --> 25:08.008
He's been destroying documents

25:08.091 --> 25:10.761
shredding them
and then putting them in burn bags.

25:10.844 --> 25:12.763
What would it take to get in there?

25:14.556 --> 25:16.350
All right, let's start with the good news.

25:16.433 --> 25:18.227
Tech lab has a remote scanner

25:18.310 --> 25:20.938
that they can attach
to the head of Kent's shredder.

25:21.021 --> 25:23.524
Makes a copy before
it shreds anything, nice.

25:24.775 --> 25:26.777
-Something wrong with your coffee?
-No, it's fine.

25:26.860 --> 25:28.529
-You've been spoiled.
-It's fine.

25:28.612 --> 25:30.948
All right, the bad news
is getting the scanner in place.

25:31.031 --> 25:34.743
Kent's office is tough.
Not even building security has clearance.

25:34.826 --> 25:38.205
The only people allowed inside
are Kent and his assistant.

25:38.288 --> 25:39.998
Which is also the good news

25:40.082 --> 25:42.501
because at lunchtime,
no one will be on the entire floor.

25:42.584 --> 25:44.628
These are the key cards

25:44.711 --> 25:47.172
that give them access
to top floor of the building.

25:47.256 --> 25:48.465
We can't duplicate them.

25:48.549 --> 25:51.885
Kent also has
a voice-activated security system

25:51.969 --> 25:53.762
that unlocks the door to his office.

25:53.846 --> 25:56.807
It opens and responds to his voice only.

25:56.890 --> 25:58.684
Well, do we know what the password is?

25:58.767 --> 26:00.561
Thanks to your friend Jessica, we do.

26:08.402 --> 26:12.030
Now, I have Jones looking through
on-air interviews with Kent

26:12.114 --> 26:14.700
seeing if he can string together
some audio clip.

26:14.783 --> 26:17.995
Yeah, well, I doubt he speaks
a dead language when he does press.

26:19.246 --> 26:21.039
Can we get Kent to say it into a recorder?

26:21.123 --> 26:22.708
Well, I've got an idea.

26:27.045 --> 26:30.465
Your dinner with Kent.
All right, I like it.

-Mr. Kent, good to see you.

26:45.564 --> 26:47.649

-Uh…

I insist you treat yourself.

26:54.531 --> 26:56.283
You're not on the job now, are you?

26:56.950 --> 26:58.035
Uh…

26:59.578 --> 27:01.622
-Scotch and soda.
-There we go.

27:01.705 --> 27:04.583
-I appreciate the invite.
-Well, it's the least I can do.

27:04.666 --> 27:06.543
Believe me, I wish I could do more.

27:06.627 --> 27:08.212
Oh, I'm… I'm fine, really.

27:09.213 --> 27:11.006
How would you like to come work for me?

27:11.089 --> 27:14.635
A member of my finance committee
is stepping down in a couple of months.

27:15.177 --> 27:16.970
It's a very lucrative position.

27:18.180 --> 27:21.225
I'm in the middle of auditing your company
and you're offering me work?

27:26.021 --> 27:27.898
but he would look even better
in my offices.

I've already got a job.

27:32.611 --> 27:33.946
No.

27:34.029 --> 27:37.491
No, working for Novice is more than a job.

27:37.574 --> 27:40.244
It's an achievement. It's a new beginning.

27:40.327 --> 27:42.412

27:43.497 --> 27:44.915

27:44.998 --> 27:47.835
I understand the etymology of "novice."

27:47.918 --> 27:51.129
It's synonymous with the newly arrived,

27:51.213 --> 27:54.132
unique and original.

27:54.216 --> 27:56.260
I also know a few other words.

-I want incentive, details.

it won't change what happened.

I don't think you do.

How he was poisoned?

This chemical,

30:30.038 --> 30:33.834
it drops the heart rate,
spikes the blood pressure.

You can't see.

30:37.087 --> 30:40.257
And a few minutes later, you can't feel.
You're dead.

from the shredder in Kent's office.

This is Hayes' prototype.

31:07.159 --> 31:09.161
Yeah, and it never worked.

Kent tried to make it look like espionage
and he had the damn thing the whole time.

31:13.540 --> 31:14.958
This is the cover-up.

31:15.042 --> 31:18.754
Neal, I think I know why Hayes was killed.

31:29.723 --> 31:32.309
Found another document in the shredder.

31:32.392 --> 31:35.938
It's addressed
to an unnamed foreign intelligence agency

31:36.021 --> 31:38.148
to arrange a meeting
in the next month and a half.

31:38.232 --> 31:39.525
The trips he has been taking.

31:39.608 --> 31:41.360
Kent knew he wouldn't
win the defense contract

31:41.443 --> 31:42.486
from our country in time.

31:42.569 --> 31:45.113
So he decided to sell his device
to another government.

31:45.197 --> 31:46.406
It's treason for profit.

31:46.490 --> 31:49.701
Hayes didn't want any part of that.
That's why Kent killed him.

31:49.785 --> 31:52.579
And corporate espionage
is the perfect cover.

turns up with it later…

Kent is in the clear
and Hayes stays silent.

How do we prove it
when Kent hasn't committed treason yet?

32:04.383 --> 32:05.759
He has committed murder.

32:05.843 --> 32:07.678
The CEO is concerned

32:07.761 --> 32:10.806
about anyone finding out
what he's really up to.

32:10.889 --> 32:13.767
Maybe Hayes talked to someone
before he died.

32:15.143 --> 32:16.937
You want to use Jessica as bait?

32:19.940 --> 32:22.192
Maybe I can hint to him
that she knows something.

32:22.276 --> 32:23.360
He'll come after her.

32:23.443 --> 32:25.654
And when he does, we take him down.

32:25.737 --> 32:28.615
-Think she's up to it?
-She's certainly driven.

32:29.700 --> 32:32.077

I'm not sure
if she wants revenge or justice.

34:00.374 --> 34:01.667
in Research and Development.

34:01.750 --> 34:04.253
-Joseph Hayes.
-How do you know this?

34:04.336 --> 34:08.048
Cross referenced expense reports
between your workers

34:08.131 --> 34:10.509
to see if any were in a league
to bilk funds.

34:10.592 --> 34:14.555
Apparently, the two of them
shared a hotel room a few weeks in a row.

34:14.638 --> 34:18.725
When I confronted Miss Breslin about it,
she asked me not to say anything.

34:18.809 --> 34:21.395
I thought you might want to deal
with her appropriately.

34:21.478 --> 34:23.772
Well, I will take care of Ms. Breslin.

34:23.856 --> 34:28.235

have you thought any more about my offer?

but I've already got a job.

34:33.824 --> 34:36.785
Ah. Okay, well, if you change your mind…

34:36.869 --> 34:38.412
-I appreciate that, Wesley.
-All right.

34:39.955 --> 34:42.833
-You on the job?
-It is after 6:00.

34:44.084 --> 34:45.460
I won't tell anyone.

34:51.717 --> 34:52.843
Mmm.

34:55.470 --> 34:57.973
Hey, doing okay?

34:58.056 --> 34:59.641
An agent will be here any second.

34:59.725 --> 35:01.393
She's gonna need your phone
and all forms of ID

35:01.476 --> 35:03.270
-for the protection detail.
-Sure.

35:04.229 --> 35:06.231
Pretty calm for somebody
who is about to go into hiding.

35:06.315 --> 35:08.650
(CHUCKLES) I thought
I was supposed to be relieved.

35:13.113 --> 35:15.490

-Are you sitting down?

35:15.574 --> 35:17.826
-What is it, Mozz?
<i>-Sitting or standing?</i>

35:17.910 --> 35:18.911
I'm standing.

35:20.037 --> 35:23.081

35:23.165 --> 35:26.752

<i>I… I didn't want to say anything</i>

35:30.297 --> 35:33.967
But the trail for the box
just goes cold with him, Neal.

35:34.051 --> 35:36.136

35:37.554 --> 35:38.680

Um, I… I found it on your desk…

35:53.028 --> 35:55.072
You were in Kent's office.
What did you do, Jessica?

35:57.783 --> 36:00.744
I want him to know how it feels to die
the way Joseph died.

36:00.827 --> 36:02.246
Poisoned him? How?

36:03.539 --> 36:06.041
His daily vice, the Armagnac.

Hey, I need to get to the top floor.

36:28.313 --> 36:29.648
Nobody gets to the top floor.

-This is an emergency, sir.
-What's the emergency?

36:31.733 --> 36:32.734
Please.

36:32.818 --> 36:34.361
I've got to check with Mr. Kent
and then my supervisor.

36:34.444 --> 36:35.529
Yes, good, yes, check with Kent.

36:49.877 --> 36:51.670
You need to exit the elevator now, sir.

Will you send me up to Kent's floor?

-I don't know.
-Come on, Kent, think.

37:27.122 --> 37:30.459
This is the same poison that you gave him.

37:31.460 --> 37:34.505
You met with him,
you gave him something to drink,

37:34.588 --> 37:38.050
and then he died.
Now, how much time passed?
