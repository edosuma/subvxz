00:01.585 --> 00:08.258
<i>It seems today that all you see</i>
<i>Is violence in movies and sex on TV</i>

00:08.342 --> 00:11.970
<i>But where are those</i>
<i>Good old-fashioned values</i>

00:12.054 --> 00:14.973
<i>On which we used to rely?</i>

00:15.057 --> 00:18.227
<i>Lucky there's a family guy</i>

00:18.310 --> 00:21.605
<i>Lucky there's a man who</i>
<i>Positively can do</i>

00:21.688 --> 00:23.232
<i>All the things that make us</i>

00:23.315 --> 00:24.942
<i>Laugh and cry</i>

00:25.025 --> 00:30.072
<i>He's a family guy!</i>

00:35.869 --> 00:37.621
- Peter, we got to talk.
- Ugh.

00:37.704 --> 00:40.165
I'm concerned about Stewie's preschool.

00:40.249 --> 00:42.376
Look what they're serving at snack time.

00:42.501 --> 00:44.711
- Is, is that...
- It's dog milk.

00:44.795 --> 00:46.880
They're serving dog milk to our children.

00:46.964 --> 00:48.382
Aw, sweet, dilk.

00:49.007 --> 00:50.801
I don't want Stewie
in that school anymore.

00:50.884 --> 00:53.053
It seems like it's really gone downhill.

00:53.136 --> 00:54.513
She's not wrong to worry.

00:54.596 --> 00:58.141
There's a sign in the bathroom that says,
"If it's brown, let it mellow."

00:58.225 --> 01:00.227
Sometimes it crests the toilet lid.

01:00.310 --> 01:02.563
Peter, I think we should
send Stewie to Corridors.

01:02.646 --> 01:05.691
I know it's a little pricey,
but it's the best preschool in the area.

01:05.774 --> 01:07.609
Really? Is that the one
where they make 'em dress

01:07.693 --> 01:10.237
in the little shorts and hats
like the guy in AC/DC?

01:10.320 --> 01:11.697
Yeah, why does he wear that outfit?

01:11.780 --> 01:13.156
'Cause he rocks.

01:15.659 --> 01:16.702
When I picked this,

01:16.785 --> 01:20.247
I didn't know I'd have
to wear it when I'm 60!

01:20.330 --> 01:21.748
I'm very cold.

01:27.504 --> 01:29.506
You know what seems like a lie to me?

01:29.590 --> 01:31.967
A Forever stamp that says "love" on it.

01:32.050 --> 01:34.136
Oh, you want to go ahead of me?

01:34.219 --> 01:35.220
Hey, how are you?

01:35.304 --> 01:37.389
You know what seems like a lie to me?

01:38.140 --> 01:40.350
I can help the fourth person in line.

01:40.434 --> 01:42.144
One, two, three... yes!

01:43.437 --> 01:44.938
Cleveland, you work here?

01:45.022 --> 01:47.274
Yup, finally landed myself a job.

01:47.357 --> 01:49.776
Hey, what can Brown do for you?

01:50.944 --> 01:53.739
That's our competitor, though.
I'm not supposed to say that.

01:53.822 --> 01:56.658
It's grounds for dismissal
if anyone ever got fired here,

01:56.742 --> 01:58.952
- but they don't.
- Well, good for you.

01:59.036 --> 02:00.829
Oh, could I get a return receipt for this?

02:00.913 --> 02:03.665
It's Stewie's registration form
for his new school.

02:03.749 --> 02:05.459
Lil' Papa Stew-Stew's off to college?

02:05.542 --> 02:07.920
No, just preschool.
He's very young.

02:08.003 --> 02:11.465
Can you just charge me
my weirdly uneven price so I can be done?

02:11.548 --> 02:14.218
All right, that's $2.16.

02:14.301 --> 02:17.763
$4.37 if you want to send it the priority.

02:17.846 --> 02:19.932
Oh, no, we got to start saving our pennies

02:20.015 --> 02:22.059
now that we're sending
Stewie to a new school.

02:22.142 --> 02:24.228
I'm actually doing some
job hunting after this.

02:24.311 --> 02:25.395
Let's go up there!

02:25.479 --> 02:27.648
You know, Lois, the post office is hiring.

02:27.731 --> 02:30.192
Really?
Oh, wow, that'd be great.

02:30.275 --> 02:32.486
Yeah, I'd be happy
to get you an interview,

02:32.569 --> 02:35.113
and as a white woman,
you'd be a minority here,

02:35.197 --> 02:36.949
unless you're an alcoholic.

02:48.377 --> 02:50.254
Wow, this place is really fancy.

02:50.337 --> 02:53.090
Their Flat Stanley is
actually award-winning actor

02:53.173 --> 02:54.383
Stanley Tucci.

02:54.466 --> 02:58.053
Sometimes I wear glasses
and sometimes I don't.

02:58.512 --> 02:59.680
Hi, I'm Chadley.

02:59.763 --> 03:02.307
I've been kidnapped three times
because I come from money.

03:02.391 --> 03:04.059
Oh, yes, I've heard about your family.

03:04.142 --> 03:06.228
You've had two older brothers
die of drugs?

03:06.311 --> 03:07.312
That's right.

03:07.396 --> 03:10.148
Stewie, what would you say
to a playdate at my house tomorrow?

03:10.232 --> 03:11.650
That sounds delightful.

03:12.401 --> 03:15.445
My word, it feels so good
to finally be where I belong.

03:15.529 --> 03:18.574
Like Judd Hirsch
at the gigantic sweater store.

03:18.782 --> 03:21.368
Hi, uh, all five of us are Judd Hirsch.

03:21.451 --> 03:23.912
Do you have a sweater
big enough to fit all of us?

03:25.289 --> 03:27.291
Okay, everybody climb in.

03:28.250 --> 03:31.336
Ah, I can't wait to spill soup on this.

03:31.420 --> 03:33.672
Okay, Judds, shamble away.

03:39.386 --> 03:42.598
Good having you aboard, Lois.
Let me show you around.

03:42.681 --> 03:44.683
That guy right there? Larry.

03:44.766 --> 03:45.767
Okay, got it.

03:46.059 --> 03:47.352
A-And what's this giant,

03:47.436 --> 03:49.730
empty,
football-stadium-sized room?

03:49.813 --> 03:53.275
Oh, the post office anticipates
that within the next five years

03:53.358 --> 03:58.447
at least 200 million men in this country
will be ordering and receiving RealDolls.

03:58.530 --> 04:01.450
Every man will have
seven to nine RealDolls.

04:01.533 --> 04:03.410
Asians, blonde Southern girls,

04:03.493 --> 04:07.748
blonde Asians capable of performing
every possible sexual act,

04:07.831 --> 04:09.833
or at least incapable of refusing.

04:09.917 --> 04:13.170
You can put one in your car
and drive in the car pool lane with it

04:13.253 --> 04:15.214
and then maybe you can push her head down,

04:15.297 --> 04:17.382
thus defeating the purpose
of the car pool lane

04:17.466 --> 04:19.843
while fulfilling the purpose
of the RealDoll.

04:19.927 --> 04:21.428
Maybe a trucker goes by.

04:21.512 --> 04:24.014
You say, "Hey, Janine, give him a show."

04:24.097 --> 04:27.017
Maybe later you ask yourself
some tough questions, like,

04:27.100 --> 04:30.270
"Why is it so important to you
to impress and excite truckers?"

04:30.354 --> 04:32.022
Anyhoo, grab that letter opener.

04:32.105 --> 04:34.566
I'm gonna show you
why you should never mail cash.

04:38.987 --> 04:42.366
Another good postal tip is,
if you wait to deliver your mail at night,

04:42.449 --> 04:45.160
you can smell a lot
of really nice dinners.

04:45.244 --> 04:47.829
Oh, no, it's that Amazon drone.

04:47.913 --> 04:49.164
Try to ignore it.

04:49.248 --> 04:51.750
Hey, Cleveland, what are you doing?
Taking a walk?

04:51.834 --> 04:54.336
- No, I'm delivering mail.
- By foot?

04:54.419 --> 04:56.171
Yeah, that won't take too long.

04:56.255 --> 04:57.297
Well, got to go.

04:57.381 --> 05:00.133
Got to deliver these fat pants
to your fat son.

05:01.260 --> 05:03.303
He was harsh, but not untruthful.

05:03.387 --> 05:05.514
We got to special-order
Cleveland Jr.'s pants

05:05.597 --> 05:08.308
from a company that
manufactures grill covers.

05:13.939 --> 05:15.274
Thanks for coming over, Stewie.

05:15.357 --> 05:17.776
Oh, thanks for having me.
Quite a place you've got here.

05:17.860 --> 05:18.861
Your mother seemed nice.

05:18.944 --> 05:21.947
Yeah, I've only met her
a couple of times, but yeah.

05:22.030 --> 05:23.282
This is my bedroom.

05:28.120 --> 05:30.080
Is that car bed a Bentley?

05:30.163 --> 05:31.540
And is that guy the driver?

05:31.623 --> 05:34.418
Ready for this evening's
trip to Snoozetown, sir?

05:34.501 --> 05:36.420
Not yet.
Sad story.

05:36.503 --> 05:39.089
He used to drive the bed
for Michael Jackson's monkey.

05:39.173 --> 05:41.216
I've seen some terrible things.

05:41.300 --> 05:42.593
This is extraordinary.

05:42.676 --> 05:44.219
Oh, it's fine, I suppose,

05:44.303 --> 05:47.097
but you probably have
even nicer things at your mansion.

05:47.181 --> 05:48.682
I'd love to come see it sometime.

05:48.765 --> 05:51.018
Oh, um, y-yes, yes, my mansion.

05:51.101 --> 05:54.146
Y-Yes, you-you should
come see my mansion, b-by all means.

05:54.229 --> 05:55.480
I mean, not-not right this minute.

05:55.564 --> 05:57.900
I-I have the U.S.
men's wrestling team there...

05:57.983 --> 05:59.067
I'm gonna kill a wrestler...

05:59.151 --> 06:01.528
- But then after that, you should.
- I can't wait.

06:01.612 --> 06:03.614
Come on, let's go see
if the maid brought her son,

06:03.697 --> 06:05.866
so we can push him
and he can't do anything.

06:06.450 --> 06:08.869
God, I like it here, but what am I doing?

06:08.952 --> 06:10.495
I don't have a fancy house.

06:10.579 --> 06:13.040
I'm living a lie, like FDR.

06:13.248 --> 06:17.878
And so I say to you, America,
we are going to win this war,

06:17.961 --> 06:19.922
we're going to end this depression,

06:20.005 --> 06:23.342
and there's no reason
to suspect that I cannot walk.

06:23.425 --> 06:25.052
God bless America!

06:29.431 --> 06:31.433
And cut.
The newsreel's over.

06:31.517 --> 06:33.310
- Thank you, Mr. President.

06:33.393 --> 06:34.686
You're welcome, gentlemen.

06:34.770 --> 06:37.689
Now, if you'd kindly kick me
into the closet with the mops.

06:41.777 --> 06:44.238
Ah, must be a Yale man.

06:44.321 --> 06:45.447
Shut up.

06:49.576 --> 06:51.328
Hello, loyal mailwoman.

06:51.411 --> 06:55.832
This is a letter to Hollywood,
saying, "Keep it up! Movies are great!"

06:57.084 --> 06:58.794
Cleveland, what should I do with this?

06:58.877 --> 07:02.047
I-It just says "Hollywood, U.S.A.,"
and this isn't a stamp,

07:02.130 --> 07:03.799
it's the little sticker from an apple.

07:03.882 --> 07:06.635
Oh, I can't never get those off.
I just eat 'em.

07:06.718 --> 07:08.345
Anyway, just put it in here.

07:08.428 --> 07:10.639
- But what's that?
- It's the dead letter bin.

07:10.722 --> 07:13.433
It's all the stale mail
what never got delivered

07:13.517 --> 07:16.478
incomplete addresses,

07:16.562 --> 07:18.188
house at the top of a hill,

07:18.272 --> 07:21.900
anyone who uses one of those
French sevens with a slash in it.

07:21.984 --> 07:24.486
Well, this is horrible.
I'm going to organize these.

07:24.570 --> 07:26.113
There might be some we could resend.

07:26.196 --> 07:27.865
That's above and beyond, Lois.

07:27.948 --> 07:31.201
You know, you do the uniform proud,
like I like to think I...

07:31.285 --> 07:32.786
Oh, chili dog got me.

07:33.912 --> 07:35.789
Look at all these.
This is a mess.

07:35.873 --> 07:38.041
Here's two that are stuck together.

07:38.542 --> 07:40.961
What the hell?
This is from Peter.

07:44.423 --> 07:46.758
Who the hell is Gretchen Mercer?

07:46.842 --> 07:50.012
And this is postmarked
a week before our wedding!

07:55.225 --> 07:57.728
Aw, there was a time when the president

07:57.811 --> 08:01.607
of the Jonathan Taylor Thomas Fan Club
got a lot of mail.

08:09.198 --> 08:10.991
I don't know what to do, Bonnie.

08:11.074 --> 08:14.953
Why would Peter write a letter
to another woman just before our wedding?

08:15.037 --> 08:16.997
Why don't you just open it and read it?

08:17.080 --> 08:20.417
What? Th-That's a federal offense.
I can't do that.

08:20.501 --> 08:25.088
Don't you realize, as a postal employee,
I'm 6,004th in line for the presidency?

08:25.172 --> 08:26.882
Well, then why don't you
just deliver the letter

08:26.965 --> 08:29.801
and see for yourself
who this Gretchen Mercer is?

08:29.885 --> 08:31.762
Bonnie, that's a great idea.

08:31.845 --> 08:33.764
Although it could be a little awkward.

08:33.847 --> 08:36.183
You could always just ask Peter about it.

08:36.266 --> 08:38.393
No, he won't talk about anything serious

08:38.477 --> 08:39.770
unless there's a crackling fire

08:39.853 --> 08:42.731
to punctuate
uncomfortable family revelations.

08:45.400 --> 08:47.069
I didn't fall off the roof.

08:47.152 --> 08:48.529
I jumped.

08:49.947 --> 08:51.740
I never found you attractive,

08:51.823 --> 08:53.992
and what's more, I never respected you.

08:55.577 --> 08:57.496
I know about Maurice.

09:00.082 --> 09:01.667
Which Maurice?

09:06.713 --> 09:08.507
Oh, Brian, I need your help!

09:08.590 --> 09:11.218
Chadley wants to have a playdate,
here at my house!

09:11.301 --> 09:12.886
- Well, that's great.
- No, it's not!

09:12.970 --> 09:14.429
I can't let him see this dump.

09:14.513 --> 09:17.307
Come on, Stewie,
Chadley should like you for who are.

09:17.391 --> 09:18.809
Besides, this place isn't so bad.

09:18.892 --> 09:22.062
Brian, Chadley's parents
each have their own bathroom.

09:22.145 --> 09:24.523
I've seen the fat man
pee through Lois' legs

09:24.606 --> 09:26.233
while she's sitting on the toilet.

09:26.316 --> 09:28.360
What I've got to do
is find a spectacular house

09:28.443 --> 09:30.821
that I can pretend is mine
to impress Chadley.

09:30.904 --> 09:32.614
Oh, why don't you
just use Babs and Carter's?

09:32.698 --> 09:35.826
I can't, they're having
an <i>Eyes Wide Shut</i> party all weekend.

09:36.869 --> 09:38.620
I can't find my wiener with this mask.

09:38.704 --> 09:41.206
All right, time-out.
Let's-let's all just find our wieners

09:41.290 --> 09:42.958
and then put the masks back on.

09:48.714 --> 09:51.717
Okay, 940, this is the house.

09:53.927 --> 09:55.888
Hi, are you Gretchen Mercer?

09:55.971 --> 09:57.389
Yes, may I help you?

09:57.472 --> 10:01.143
Oh, yeah, we found
an old letter addressed to you.

10:02.227 --> 10:03.562
Peter Griffin?

10:03.645 --> 10:05.814
Wow, this is from an old boyfriend.

10:05.898 --> 10:08.108
What?

10:08.192 --> 10:10.527
Wow, well, um,

10:10.611 --> 10:14.281
believe it or not, I'm actually married
to Peter Griffin right now.

10:14.364 --> 10:16.825
Huh, that is quite a coincidence.

10:16.909 --> 10:18.869
I wonder why he was writing me.

10:20.954 --> 10:23.165
I see you move your finger along
as you read.

10:23.248 --> 10:24.875
That's what little kids do.

10:24.958 --> 10:26.126
Oh, it was nothing.

10:26.210 --> 10:29.213
He was just writing to say
that he was excited about getting married

10:29.296 --> 10:31.340
and that he finally had enough Camel Cash

10:31.423 --> 10:33.717
to get a leather jacket
and a pool floatie.

10:33.800 --> 10:36.762
Huh, well, thank you, Gretchen.
I am very relieved.

10:36.845 --> 10:38.138
I was thinking the worst.

10:38.222 --> 10:41.683
Oh, I understand,
but you have nothing to worry about.

10:41.767 --> 10:44.603
You're right.
I guess jealousy's my weak spot.

10:44.686 --> 10:46.230
Everyone has one.

10:46.313 --> 10:47.606
Even Achilles.

10:47.814 --> 10:50.234
So, you can only be injured
on your Achilles' tendon?

10:50.317 --> 10:51.318
That's right.

10:51.401 --> 10:54.404
My mother dipped me into the River Styx
and she held me by my heel,

10:54.488 --> 10:56.448
so that's the only part
that can be injured.

10:56.532 --> 10:57.741
How about you, Testiclies?

10:57.824 --> 11:00.327
It's the same...
It's-it's-it's similar.

11:08.627 --> 11:10.546
So, what do you think of the house, Brian?

11:10.629 --> 11:12.673
As far as Chadley knows,
this is where I live.

11:12.756 --> 11:13.966
Stewie, who owns this place?

11:14.049 --> 11:17.970
Oh, just some rich idiot I saw bragging
about his vacation on Instagram.

11:18.053 --> 11:20.264
He posted a picture of his feet in sand.

11:20.347 --> 11:21.890
You're a guy, don't do that.

11:21.974 --> 11:23.100
What a dick.

11:23.183 --> 11:24.893
Hey, I'll swallow his dental floss.

11:24.977 --> 11:26.812
You pull it out of me
and put it back on the roll.

11:26.895 --> 11:28.480
- Good call.

11:28.564 --> 11:29.857
Ah, that must be Chadley.

11:31.483 --> 11:33.527
Hi, Stewie.
I love your house.

11:33.610 --> 11:34.695
Where are your servants?

11:34.778 --> 11:37.698
Oh, probably cooking bananas
and doing the cha-cha-cha.

11:37.781 --> 11:39.950
You know, this is
a great house for a party.

11:40.033 --> 11:41.535
You could invite the whole class.

11:41.618 --> 11:43.787
I-I say, that's a brilliant idea!

11:43.871 --> 11:44.872
What the hell are you doing?

11:44.955 --> 11:47.124
Relax, these people
are gone for a few more days.

11:47.207 --> 11:50.586
I'll invite everyone over
and impress the whole class in one shot.

11:50.669 --> 11:52.629
That'll cover my playdates for a year.

11:52.713 --> 11:54.923
- You really think that'll work?
- Absolutely.

11:55.007 --> 11:56.842
And when it does, I'll be as popular

11:56.925 --> 11:59.511
as the first kid in school
to get his driver's license.

11:59.720 --> 12:01.972
Hey, heard you got your license.

12:02.055 --> 12:05.267
Maybe after school,
you could take me to get some groceries?

12:05.350 --> 12:08.020
Yeah, or maybe you and me
hop in that car of yours

12:08.103 --> 12:09.980
and do some grocery shopping?

12:10.063 --> 12:12.649
Looks like you have a roomy backseat.

12:12.733 --> 12:15.777
I'd love to fill that
with groceries after school.

12:15.861 --> 12:17.571
Hey, it's Stewie.

12:17.654 --> 12:20.032
All I know about cars is what my mom does.

12:27.331 --> 12:28.624
Gretchen?

12:28.707 --> 12:29.791
Wow, you look great!

12:29.875 --> 12:31.460
Yeah, I didn't have kids.

12:31.543 --> 12:34.213
Oh, yeah, of course,
but what the hell are you doing here?

12:34.296 --> 12:36.048
I haven't seen you in 20 years!

12:36.131 --> 12:38.217
Peter, I finally got your letter.

12:38.300 --> 12:39.593
You know, the one where you said

12:39.676 --> 12:41.887
that you were having doubts
about marrying Lois

12:41.970 --> 12:44.056
and you still had thoughts
about marrying me.

12:44.973 --> 12:47.226
Gretchen, I wrote that a long time ago.

12:47.309 --> 12:48.936
Well, my answer is yes, Peter.

12:49.019 --> 12:50.854
Yes, I will marry you!

12:51.522 --> 12:53.232
Gretchen, I am already happily...

12:53.315 --> 12:55.317
Moderately hap... Relative... I am...

12:55.400 --> 12:56.401
I am married.

12:56.485 --> 12:58.820
Oh, then I suppose
your wife is entitled to know

12:58.904 --> 13:02.241
that you were still in love with me
just days before your wedding.

13:02.324 --> 13:04.368
Blackmail!

13:04.451 --> 13:05.494
Thank you, Cleveland.

13:06.203 --> 13:09.248
And I don't know what to call the thing
you're doing to me, lady.

13:15.420 --> 13:17.589
Look, Gretchen, I-I know
I wrote you that letter,

13:17.673 --> 13:21.760
and-and-and I meant it at the time, but...
that was 20 years ago!

13:21.844 --> 13:24.054
I may have had some doubts
before my wedding,

13:24.137 --> 13:25.806
but what guy doesn't?

13:25.889 --> 13:28.767
And now I know
I made the right choice marrying Lois.

13:29.101 --> 13:31.270
Well, she's a lucky woman,

13:31.353 --> 13:32.896
and I'm sorry for what I said.

13:32.980 --> 13:35.566
I certainly don't want
to cause any trouble for you.

13:35.649 --> 13:37.025
It's just that when I got this letter,

13:37.150 --> 13:39.486
it reminded me how sweet and funny
you always were.

13:39.570 --> 13:41.822
That's nice, but I-I should go.

13:41.905 --> 13:44.533
Thanks for not making fun of me
for ordering a hot chocolate,

13:44.616 --> 13:48.328
and go ahead and look into Facebook
'cause this is kind of what it's for.

13:48.412 --> 13:53.417
Wait, before we say our final good-bye,
what do you say we have one last hurrah?

13:53.500 --> 13:56.837
I've got two tickets
to a Ray LaMontagne concert tonight.

13:56.920 --> 13:59.423
Oh, I-I'm not sure that's a good idea.

13:59.506 --> 14:01.800
It feels a little weird
going out with another lady.

14:01.884 --> 14:04.803
Oh, come on, Peter, I drove all this way.

14:04.887 --> 14:07.222
Let me go home with one last good memory,

14:07.306 --> 14:10.767
and then I promise, you have heard
the last of Gretchen Mercer.

14:10.851 --> 14:12.769
Well, I should probably say no,

14:12.853 --> 14:15.105
but I've never been
known for my good judgment.

14:15.189 --> 14:17.691
I mean, that's how I got into trouble
with the Peter Catcher.

14:21.361 --> 14:23.030
-Oh, Peter!

14:23.113 --> 14:24.948
Come and get your lollipops!

14:25.032 --> 14:26.116
Lollipops!

14:26.200 --> 14:28.160
Come along, Peter!

14:28.243 --> 14:29.870
Peter, you mustn't.

14:29.953 --> 14:32.122
I've got cream pies.

14:32.206 --> 14:33.874
Trinkle tarts.

14:33.957 --> 14:35.000
Trinkle tarts!

14:41.131 --> 14:43.050
I'm gonna get so molested.

14:50.682 --> 14:53.060
Oh, Peter, you can
take off your hat and jacket.

14:53.143 --> 14:56.271
It's not illegal for two old friends
to go to a concert.

14:56.355 --> 14:57.481
Yeah, I guess you're right.

14:57.564 --> 15:01.151
I mean it's not like anybody I know
would be at a Ray LaMontagne concert.

15:01.235 --> 15:02.486
Peter!

15:02.569 --> 15:03.570
Where'd he go?

15:03.654 --> 15:05.030
I'm-I'm gonna keep the hat on.

15:05.113 --> 15:07.282
I'm sorry, Gretchen.
This-this was a mistake.

15:07.366 --> 15:09.910
I just feel too guilty
being out with another woman.

15:09.993 --> 15:11.328
I can't do this to Lois.

15:11.620 --> 15:14.373
Ah, I understand.

15:14.456 --> 15:17.292
Well, I guess there's no shame
in coming in second, huh?

15:17.376 --> 15:18.418
That's right.

15:18.502 --> 15:20.462
Except in, like, wars.

15:20.546 --> 15:23.674
Aw, you are still funny, sweet Peter.

15:23.757 --> 15:25.092
Yeah, I guess so.

15:25.175 --> 15:28.011
All right, I got to go.
The beard inspector's coming, anyway.

15:28.095 --> 15:29.638
Uh, sir, where's your beard?

15:29.721 --> 15:31.056
I'm leaving.
I'm on my way out.

15:32.015 --> 15:33.642
That's my Peter.

15:34.560 --> 15:36.270
That's <i>my</i> Peter.

15:45.612 --> 15:48.156
Wow, looks like you're actually
gonna get away with this, Stewie.

15:48.240 --> 15:50.033
And you threw a good party.

15:50.117 --> 15:51.535
Yeah, it's getting pretty wild.

15:51.618 --> 15:54.496
Over in the guest bedroom
there's a girl pulling a train.

15:54.580 --> 15:56.206
This'll show my dad.

15:56.748 --> 15:58.417
Hey, by the way,
how'd you pay for all this?

15:58.500 --> 16:00.669
I dated Donald Sterling for two weeks.

16:01.003 --> 16:02.296
He's a good man!

16:02.379 --> 16:04.590
You don't know him like I know him!

16:06.300 --> 16:07.676
People. People?

16:07.759 --> 16:10.971
As your rich host,
I would like to say a word if I may.

16:11.054 --> 16:14.266
I cannot tell you how pleased
I am to have finally found

16:14.349 --> 16:17.477
a group of peers with whom
I share so many common interests...

16:17.561 --> 16:19.605
- And here come the people who live here.

16:22.191 --> 16:23.358
Please let me explain!

16:23.442 --> 16:26.278
I was just worried
you wouldn't accept me because...

16:26.361 --> 16:28.238
I'm not wealthy like you are.

16:28.322 --> 16:30.199
Stewie, it's not that you're poor.

16:30.282 --> 16:32.534
It's that you lied to us and you're poor.

16:38.957 --> 16:41.168
I'm sorry you lost
your rich friends, Stewie.

16:41.251 --> 16:43.378
Well, that's all right,
I don't need money.

16:43.462 --> 16:45.464
I already have everything I need.

16:45.547 --> 16:48.091
Excuse me, is one of you Chadley?

16:48.175 --> 16:49.968
You left your wallet inside.

16:50.719 --> 16:52.095
Chicka-chickaw!

16:52.179 --> 16:55.891
Well, that "chicka-chickaw"
makes me think you're not Chadley.

16:55.974 --> 16:58.393
Oh, no! I chicka-chickawed too early!

17:03.982 --> 17:05.943
Hey, Lois, you mind if I cut out of here?

17:06.026 --> 17:07.194
- Not at all.
- Thanks.

17:07.277 --> 17:10.072
Not to be too intimate,
but I need to have a bowel movement

17:10.155 --> 17:11.490
and I can't go here.

17:11.573 --> 17:14.243
I can only go at home
or at the Koo Koo Roo.

17:18.121 --> 17:20.916
Hello? I-Is someone there?

17:21.166 --> 17:24.294
I thought I heard something
over the roar of my tinnitus.

17:24.920 --> 17:27.130
Oh, I'm-I'm sure it's nothing.

17:34.263 --> 17:36.181
- Ooh, a text.

17:36.557 --> 17:38.517
"I'm taking care of our problem.

17:38.600 --> 17:41.228
"We'll be together soon.
Love, Gretchen."

17:41.311 --> 17:42.521
Huh.

17:42.604 --> 17:46.149
Meg, you're kind of a loner psychopath.
What does this mean?

17:46.233 --> 17:48.735
Oh, this woman is clearly a spurned lover

17:48.819 --> 17:50.028
who's planning to kill Mom.

17:50.112 --> 17:51.196
Ah, thank you.

17:54.241 --> 17:55.325
You're a good dog, Meg.

18:00.706 --> 18:05.669
Well, well, well...
if it isn't the first Mrs. Griffin.

18:05.752 --> 18:08.130
Gretchen? What are you doing here?

18:08.213 --> 18:12.801
Making sure Peter can finally be with me,
which is what he's always wanted.

18:12.885 --> 18:16.638
Gretchen, it's 3:15 on a workday.
The post office is closed.

18:16.722 --> 18:18.599
Lois! Gretchen wants to kill you,

18:18.682 --> 18:20.976
and I have a slip
that says we've got a package?

18:21.059 --> 18:23.187
Peter, I'm glad you're here to see this.

18:23.270 --> 18:25.397
You and I can finally be together.

18:27.608 --> 18:29.359
Peter, what's going on?

18:29.443 --> 18:31.153
She's nuts is what's going on!

18:31.236 --> 18:32.446
I don't want to be with her!

18:32.529 --> 18:34.990
Oh, yeah? That's not what you wrote.

18:35.073 --> 18:38.202
That's right.
I lied about what was in that letter.

18:38.285 --> 18:41.663
Lois, Lois, before you read that,

18:41.747 --> 18:44.291
I'm the one throwing out
all your beige bras.

18:44.374 --> 18:46.293
Guys don't like beige bras.

18:47.669 --> 18:50.714
You told an ex-girlfriend
a week before our wedding

18:50.797 --> 18:52.132
you were having doubts?

18:52.216 --> 18:53.467
Lois, Lois, listen to me.

18:53.550 --> 18:56.386
Yes, it is true,
just before we got married,

18:56.470 --> 18:58.096
I was having some doubts.

18:58.180 --> 19:00.224
I mean, your family hated me.

19:00.307 --> 19:02.476
I-I didn't think
I was good enough for you.

19:02.559 --> 19:05.562
We were kids, I was scared.
Weren't you?

19:05.646 --> 19:09.358
No, I was in love,
which is what I thought you were, too.

19:09.441 --> 19:12.528
I was in love, Lois... and I still am.

19:12.611 --> 19:16.031
Not a day goes by where I don't
thank my lucky stars for picking you.

19:16.114 --> 19:18.200
It was the best choice I ever made.

19:18.283 --> 19:21.245
Now, put that gun down, Gretchen.
You don't have to do this.

19:21.328 --> 19:24.414
That's right, you don't...
because you can have him.

19:24.498 --> 19:25.541
What?

19:25.624 --> 19:28.252
I'll never forgive you for this, Peter.
We're through!

19:29.378 --> 19:33.298
Oh, Peter! I can't wait for you to meet
the dogs and the squirrels.

19:33.882 --> 19:35.217
Hey, Gretchen?

19:37.970 --> 19:40.138
Get away from my husband.

19:43.809 --> 19:45.644
Wait, so you're not mad?

19:45.727 --> 19:48.814
No, Peter, I was lying
so she'd let her guard down.

19:48.897 --> 19:50.482
But what about the letter?

19:50.566 --> 19:53.235
Peter, do you remember me
crying at our wedding?

19:53.318 --> 19:54.695
Sure, it's in all our pictures.

19:54.778 --> 19:56.113
That's doubt.

19:56.196 --> 19:58.115
But there's no doubt anymore.

19:58.198 --> 20:00.659
You're the only man for me, Peter Griffin.

20:01.076 --> 20:03.495
I love you, Lois.

20:05.664 --> 20:07.124
Oh, Peter!

20:07.207 --> 20:10.419
Now come on, let's get it on
through a P.O. box.

20:10.961 --> 20:12.504
Peter, this isn't working.

20:12.588 --> 20:14.840
Well, I'm at full go.
Are you sure you're in the right box?

20:14.923 --> 20:16.383
- Yes.
- Box 528?

20:16.466 --> 20:18.093
Yes, 528.

20:18.177 --> 20:19.761
All right, just reach in and grab it.

20:24.266 --> 20:27.811
Wow, Mom, I can't believe
you got fired from the post office.

20:27.895 --> 20:29.938
Well, they didn't like
me beating up Gretchen

20:30.022 --> 20:31.231
on federal property,

20:31.315 --> 20:33.692
and then after your father
plugged up that P.O. box,

20:33.775 --> 20:35.819
there was a mutual parting of the ways.

20:35.903 --> 20:38.071
Well, Stewie, I guess
since Lois lost her job,

20:38.155 --> 20:40.449
you're not going to be able to go
to that fancy preschool anymore.

20:40.532 --> 20:42.367
Eh, I don't need school.
I'll be fine.

20:42.451 --> 20:44.953
I'll just become a YouTube star
like Jenna Marbles.

20:45.037 --> 20:47.164
- Who's that?
- No one knows, but she's rich.

20:47.247 --> 20:49.249
As rich as Ray William Johnson.

20:49.333 --> 20:51.502
- Who's that?
- Nobody knows, but he's rich.

20:51.585 --> 20:55.672
As rich as Bethany Mota
or Marcus Butler or Ingrid Nilsen.

20:56.507 --> 20:58.133
This? This is over.
