03:24.412 --> 03:27.499
There are probably
80,000 ramen shops in Japan.

03:34.005 --> 03:37.008
<i>It's like bread for the French.</i>

03:38.676 --> 03:40.887
It's something we eat on a daily basis.

03:47.269 --> 03:50.104
<i>When an American is running a ramen shop</i>

03:50.187 --> 03:56.027
we wonder,
"Can this person really make ramen?"

10:53.402 --> 10:55.029
Special with three eggs.

10:55.112 --> 10:57.239
Three eggs, ok.

10:57.323 --> 11:00.702
Thank you for waiting.
Karashi miso ramen.

15:01.275 --> 15:04.070
Ramen has only been in Japan 100 years.

15:04.153 --> 15:08.240
<i>It's a very new food in Japanese history.</i>

15:49.281 --> 15:52.659
<i>There's shoyu, shio,</i>
<i>miso, or tonkotsu flavors,</i>

15:52.743 --> 15:55.121
thick noodles, thin noodles.

15:58.249 --> 16:02.003
<i>This freedom is unique to ramen.</i>

16:07.758 --> 16:13.180
A chef's experience is very important.

21:32.916 --> 21:34.543
Ramen shops can be divided into

21:34.626 --> 21:37.713
the artisan type and the commercial type.

21:38.297 --> 21:41.300
<i>The commercial types are by far</i>
<i>the most common.</i>

21:41.383 --> 21:46.012
<i>They just assemble ready-made ingredients</i>
<i>and serve it.</i>

21:47.097 --> 21:50.809
The artisan types
create their own unique recipes by hand

21:50.892 --> 21:53.854
<i>and serve it themselves.</i>

21:55.188 --> 21:57.273
<i>But, even Japanese ramen artisans</i>

21:57.358 --> 22:01.403
<i>have a difficult time</i>
<i>making ramen noodles.</i>

22:01.486 --> 22:07.159
Usually, they just make the soup.

30:23.321 --> 30:27.951
Ivan, at that time, had a shaved head,

30:28.034 --> 30:31.913
<i>and he always had his T-shirt</i>
<i>tucked into his shorts</i>

30:31.997 --> 30:35.541
and he always carried a backpack.

30:35.625 --> 30:42.298
<i>His son had the same haircut</i>
<i>and they both had the same glasses.</i>

30:43.466 --> 30:48.013
It was totally unique.
A type of person I'd never seen before.

31:16.582 --> 31:18.834
<i>When we were together, as families,</i>

31:18.919 --> 31:21.379
<i>Ivan with his son, and me with mine,</i>

31:21.462 --> 31:24.340
it was like we felt at ease, maybe?

31:24.424 --> 31:29.137
<i>It was a strange sensation.</i>

31:31.764 --> 31:33.808
<i>He wasn't really my type.</i>

31:36.186 --> 31:41.274
But it didn't matter.

31:44.527 --> 31:46.446
I might die laughing.

31:46.529 --> 31:49.365
Keep going. You can do it.

32:22.357 --> 32:27.653
It was like an incredible encounter.

33:53.698 --> 33:56.659
-Did you add anything?
-I added soup stock only.

33:57.827 --> 34:00.538
-No good?
-Don't we need to add anything else?

34:02.082 --> 34:03.791
-It's tasty.
-Isn't it tasty?

34:03.874 --> 34:06.211
Yeah, but maybe we should add more sugar.

34:06.294 --> 34:10.798
Boiled food is tastier
if you put in a lot of seasonings.

34:12.633 --> 34:13.843
It's good.

34:18.973 --> 34:20.641
More?

34:31.361 --> 34:33.529
That's it.

37:51.143 --> 37:52.437
Thank you so much.

37:56.106 --> 37:58.108
I could see he wasn't happy.

37:59.277 --> 38:01.946
<i>He didn't have direction.</i>

38:05.783 --> 38:07.785
He needed a change in his life.

38:20.840 --> 38:22.342
Sorry to keep you waiting.

38:33.603 --> 38:35.563
Now, for a limited time,
scraggly and uneven noodles.

38:37.565 --> 38:39.609
Don't make me laugh.

38:57.585 --> 38:59.629
I believed in him.

43:08.127 --> 43:09.629
<i>I, Hiroshi Osaki,</i>

43:09.712 --> 43:14.008
am the man who has eaten
the most ramen in all Japan.

43:14.091 --> 43:15.550
<i>I'm 58.</i>

43:15.635 --> 43:18.638
<i>I've had 23,000 bowls of ramen in my life.</i>

43:18.721 --> 43:21.306
<i>For me, ramen is everything.</i>

43:21.390 --> 43:22.975
<i>I was interested in seeing how good</i>

43:23.058 --> 43:26.812
the ramen from a foreign chef could be.

43:28.606 --> 43:31.025
When I was on the train
on the way to Ivan Ramen,

43:31.108 --> 43:32.902
my expectations, honestly,
weren't that high.

43:34.153 --> 43:38.573
I hoped it was above average.
That was the level of my expectations.

44:15.360 --> 44:20.324
After eating there, I thought
it's amazing and delicious.

44:28.582 --> 44:34.755
Ivan's roasted tomato was an idea
that no one from Japan ever thought of.

44:37.800 --> 44:43.222
<i>It was a little bit western,</i>
<i>but it was still ramen.</i>

44:46.100 --> 44:48.811
It was surprising and revolutionary.

45:01.240 --> 45:03.784
Freeze!
I am the Local News Detective.

46:10.017 --> 46:14.021
Ivan's ramen even became
an instant ramen product.

48:37.372 --> 48:40.417
<i>He takes risks.</i>

48:40.500 --> 48:43.420
<i>He's now very confident.</i>

48:43.963 --> 48:46.673
He's a completely different person.
