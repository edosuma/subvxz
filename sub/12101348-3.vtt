They're talking about your father
on the radio.

00:21.604 --> 00:24.733
Do you mind telling us why
we're not backing you up on this heist?

-Who's Genesis?

Look, I would never think
about leaving you.

01:05.982 --> 01:07.150
How can we be sure, mate?

01:07.233 --> 01:10.570
Because we have been friends
since we were kids. We're family.

Hey, if this is a job for the Big Man,
all our asses are on the line.

[Hutch] Guys, the Big Man wants
the Quantum Modular,

01:16.284 --> 01:20.747
and he wants no clues left behind,
nothing that can get traced back to him,

01:20.830 --> 01:22.415

12:50.686 --> 12:52.772
Life happened, and then it stopped?

12:55.858 --> 12:56.776
That's it?

12:58.194 --> 13:00.154
[thunder rumbling]

13:01.697 --> 13:03.574
He did it right in front of me.

13:04.450 --> 13:06.660
Don't! No, Dad!

13:07.244 --> 13:08.621
[screaming]

13:11.123 --> 13:13.501
Why would he do that? Why would he do it?

13:15.336 --> 13:19.423
Why would he…
why would he do that right in front of me?

13:19.507 --> 13:20.424
I don't know.

13:20.508 --> 13:22.343
[Sheldon exhales sharply]

13:25.721 --> 13:26.972
At least you, uh…

13:29.141 --> 13:30.810
At least you got to see him.

13:35.314 --> 13:38.025
One day, good old Mum was flush as a rose,

13:39.276 --> 13:41.153
and then she, uh, caught a fever.

13:43.656 --> 13:45.991
And so scared
that she'd pass it along to me

13:46.075 --> 13:47.701
that she wouldn't even let me in the room.

13:52.164 --> 13:53.499
Not even at the end.

13:55.918 --> 13:56.794
[inhales sharply]

13:56.877 --> 13:59.296
And then Dad, he went the following year.

13:59.964 --> 14:01.215
Heart gave out.

14:04.218 --> 14:05.052
[sniffles]

14:05.970 --> 14:08.138
You know,
sometimes I look at you and Walt,

14:08.222 --> 14:13.686
and I wonder… what it would've been like

14:13.769 --> 14:17.106
if they had lived just a little longer,
you know, if I hadn't been alone?

14:18.190 --> 14:21.068
Well… [chuckles] I mean, there's Cuthbert,

14:21.151 --> 14:25.364
but, uh, he's hardly what I would call
a scintillating conversationalist.

14:26.782 --> 14:28.659
[breathing softly]

14:30.202 --> 14:31.871
[thunder rumbling]

14:55.060 --> 14:56.186
[thunder crashing]

15:01.400 --> 15:03.819
[ominous music playing]

15:31.555 --> 15:32.431
Hello.

15:33.098 --> 15:34.892
[Big Man grunting]

15:38.604 --> 15:40.105
[toilet flushing]

15:50.324 --> 15:52.409
[Big Man] Where is my Quantum Modular?

15:53.327 --> 15:54.870
[sighs]

15:59.124 --> 16:01.835
Well, I'm waiting.

16:05.130 --> 16:07.883
Hey, look, I know I screwed up,
but I promise you--

16:07.967 --> 16:09.718
[air blowing]

16:15.891 --> 16:16.976
[grunts]

16:19.645 --> 16:20.646
You were saying?

16:21.522 --> 16:23.190
[grunts]

16:24.358 --> 16:25.234
[chuckles]

16:25.317 --> 16:29.279
You are one hard son of a bitch
for a shit with no powers.

16:29.989 --> 16:30.823
I like that.

16:31.907 --> 16:33.784
But that crew of yours,

16:33.867 --> 16:37.246
maybe if I take them apart
a piece at a time,

16:38.580 --> 16:40.082
that'll soften you up.

16:41.375 --> 16:42.584
[chuckles wryly]

16:44.044 --> 16:48.924
And that right there
is why you're a stupid little shit.

16:49.008 --> 16:50.634
I thought we already agreed on that.

16:52.219 --> 16:53.679
Don't sass me, boy,

16:53.762 --> 16:57.349
or I'll take that little toy of yours
and jam it up your ass.

16:57.433 --> 16:59.518
How can I make this right?

17:03.731 --> 17:05.274
Kulakov Brothers

17:06.275 --> 17:09.111
are delivering a briefcase
to the Hun tomorrow night.

17:09.194 --> 17:12.948
Take it off their hands.
We'll call it a push.

17:13.032 --> 17:14.158
What's in the case?

17:15.325 --> 17:16.326
Your lives.

17:18.579 --> 17:19.830
We'll get it for you.

17:21.623 --> 17:22.708
And get a haircut.

17:23.333 --> 17:25.377
-[sighs]
-You look like an idiot.

17:26.712 --> 17:27.880
Thanks for the tip.

17:29.339 --> 17:30.257

17:38.807 --> 17:41.185
[gasps, shouts in Portuguese]

17:41.769 --> 17:43.479
Shit! Would it kill you to use the door?

17:43.562 --> 17:46.190
Sorry. It's important.

17:46.273 --> 17:47.733
Yeah, so was this, asshole.

17:48.317 --> 17:49.610
The Big Man reached out.

17:51.695 --> 17:54.031
-What did he say?
-That I screwed up.

17:54.114 --> 17:56.617
We know you screwed up. Jesus! What else?

17:56.700 --> 17:59.495
[inhales deeply] He's got a job for us.

18:02.039 --> 18:04.875
We just have to take a briefcase
off the Kulakov Brothers.

18:05.751 --> 18:08.253
-The Russians?
-[shouting in Portuguese]

18:08.337 --> 18:10.297
You wanna tell the Big Man no, Jacinda?

18:11.090 --> 18:12.132
[sighs]

18:14.384 --> 18:15.552
[smacks lips] When?

18:18.305 --> 18:19.139
Tonight…

18:19.223 --> 18:20.390
-[scoffs]
-[groans]

18:20.474 --> 18:22.476
…before they deliver it to the Hun.

18:23.060 --> 18:25.104
Wow. It keeps getting better and better.

18:25.187 --> 18:26.772
-Mm-hmm.
-Is Jack in?

18:27.981 --> 18:28.816
Yeah.

18:29.566 --> 18:30.442
We need Jack.

18:30.526 --> 18:31.735
I'll talk to him.

18:31.819 --> 18:33.862
No, we need his van, Hutch.

18:33.946 --> 18:35.447
I will talk to him.

18:38.659 --> 18:40.536
No way he'd leave us hanging.

18:40.619 --> 18:41.912
Hell, no!

18:42.454 --> 18:45.916
-This is gonna make it right.
-This is gonna make us dead.

18:47.167 --> 18:49.545
The Kulakov Brothers,
they're freakin' animals!

18:49.628 --> 18:51.922
-Did you hear what they did to Stuart?
-Yeah, I heard.

18:52.005 --> 18:54.424
They zapped his dick off, like, clean off.

18:54.508 --> 18:56.343
And that was just
for looking at 'em sideways.

18:56.426 --> 18:58.804
-Stuart's an asshole.
-We're all arseholes, mate.

18:58.887 --> 19:01.765
You can't run from the Big Man, Jack.
He'll find you.

19:01.849 --> 19:03.851
Ah, well, he'd better bring his parka.

19:05.185 --> 19:06.895
Antarctica's my turf, mate.

19:06.979 --> 19:09.773
I'll bring down half the continent
on the son of a bitch who comes at me.

19:09.857 --> 19:11.859
-You can't drive to Antarctica.
-[scoffs]

19:11.942 --> 19:14.236
This old girl,
she'll get me anywhere I wanna go.

19:14.319 --> 19:17.156
-Jack, come on.
-Hasta la kiss my ass.

19:19.867 --> 19:22.077
Gabby and Jacinda won't do it without you.

19:27.374 --> 19:28.625
Did… did they say that?

19:29.543 --> 19:31.211
-Yeah.
-[chuckles]

19:33.088 --> 19:34.339
They said we need you,

19:35.674 --> 19:36.592
and they're right.

19:37.551 --> 19:38.802
We mess this up,

19:39.720 --> 19:41.263
we're all going in the stall.

19:41.763 --> 19:43.307
It's a simple grab-and-go.

19:44.057 --> 19:45.726
We're in. We're out.

19:47.311 --> 19:48.145
Easy.

-Stop screaming! I'm trying to drive!
-[Jacinda] Hold still!

19:57.446 --> 19:59.907
-They zapped me, mate!
-Well, at least it wasn't your dick.

19:59.990 --> 20:02.409
-[Gabby] Okay, this is gonna hurt.
-It already hurts!

20:06.622 --> 20:09.249
No! No, I am not okay, you arsehole!

Well, I'm just glad you've kept
your pretty little head above the waves.

-[chuckles]

26:20.370 --> 26:21.538
Easy there, pal.

26:21.621 --> 26:23.707
That's the future Mrs. Sampson
you're making eyes at.

26:23.790 --> 26:25.458
Hey, can you blame me?

26:25.542 --> 26:28.169
Hey, whatever tonic you juiced him with,
you ought to bottle that.

26:28.253 --> 26:29.671
I mean, he could use a shave but…

26:29.754 --> 26:31.381
-[chuckles]
-I had nothing to do with it.

26:31.464 --> 26:33.592

-Mm. "Life happened, and then it stopped."

26:37.304 --> 26:39.306
Your words. Simple as that.

No… no great mystery.

26:41.474 --> 26:43.810
-No secret messages from beyond the grave.
-Sheldon…

26:43.893 --> 26:47.230
I just closed my eyes and kept repeating
over and over and over what you said,

26:47.314 --> 26:49.899
"Life happened, and then it stopped."

26:50.734 --> 26:53.945
And when I opened my eyes back up,
it's like I didn't see…

26:56.698 --> 26:58.325
I didn't see the past anymore.

26:58.950 --> 27:00.827
I just saw the future. [chuckles]

27:02.704 --> 27:03.538
Hmm.

27:04.414 --> 27:06.333
Chin up, eyes forward.

That's right.

27:09.336 --> 27:12.631
Well, the lap doesn't look big enough
for the both of us, so, uh, do me a favor.

27:12.714 --> 27:15.258

-Yeah.

27:30.774 --> 27:33.360
But she is right… to thank you.

27:34.861 --> 27:37.656
If you hadn't dropped by,
who knows? I might've…

27:38.657 --> 27:41.743
I don't know. I might've found
my own roof to jump off of.

27:43.703 --> 27:44.996
Don't ever say that.

27:47.874 --> 27:49.542
I actually thought about it.

27:54.756 --> 27:56.716
Don't tell Jane or Walt.

27:58.009 --> 27:59.928
God, if… if he knew,

28:00.011 --> 28:02.681
he'd have me locked up
before you could even take your tie off.

28:02.764 --> 28:04.391
I'm not gonna tell anybody.

28:08.186 --> 28:09.437
What do you got there?

28:11.606 --> 28:12.816
Nothing. Uh…

28:13.858 --> 28:16.528
I just borrowed a few of your drawings.

28:21.825 --> 28:22.659
You burned 'em?

28:22.742 --> 28:25.620
[laughs] They were nothing.
They were just crazy doodles.

28:29.249 --> 28:30.500
What if they weren't?

28:32.669 --> 28:34.170
Take a look at this, huh?

28:35.630 --> 28:40.802
So, uh, there was something
about these shapes,

28:40.885 --> 28:44.180
something that, uh… something
I… I couldn't stop thinking about.

28:44.264 --> 28:48.935
You know, it was like a… like a puzzle
that needed to be solved.

28:49.018 --> 28:50.186
Is that a windmill?

28:51.604 --> 28:55.734
Maybe you saw it when you were a kid.
Someplace your father took you?

Well, I told him the truth.

ever care about the truth?

I'm gonna have to change with it.

I'm gonna need one more thing from you.

Consider it a… an advance.
