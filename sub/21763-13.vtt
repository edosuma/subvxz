-Hey, it's spoiling my nostril hair!

00:52.761 --> 00:57.057
Well, Maurice, thanks to my ingenious
"Adopt an Aye-aye" program,

00:57.140 --> 01:00.769
all of the displaced aye-ayes
now have homes in the kingdom.

01:00.852 --> 01:02.520

Yep, and since that random band
of mountain lemurs hasn't attacked

everything can go back to normal!

understanding you. What happened?

01:28.630 --> 01:30.131
[crying, babbling]

01:30.215 --> 01:34.177
Yeah, that was like a bunch of noises

"The mountain lemurs attacked our kingdom

02:08.545 --> 02:10.672
Now, I know what you're thinking, Maurice.

02:10.755 --> 02:13.049
-The mountain lemurs attacked the aye-ayes
-[exclaims]

02:13.133 --> 02:14.843
-and then they attacked the crocodiles.

-they'll attack anyone else.

Excuse me, sir, but the mountain lemurs
attacked someone else.

-Ooh.

What are we gonna do? If the mountain
lemurs are attacking all of Madagascar,

02:35.196 --> 02:37.782
it's only a matter of time
before they get to our kingdom!

-Maurice is right, Your Majesty.
-[whimpering]

02:39.659 --> 02:41.578
I propose that we fortify the kingdom.

I have an announcement to make.

02:49.377 --> 02:54.173
Okay, listen up, everybody.
It has come to my attention

02:54.257 --> 02:56.676
that the mountain lemurs might attack.

the last wall we built didn't--

Bup-bup! It means that everything
can finally go back to normal.

03:54.859 --> 03:57.612
-I need to talk to you!
-I need to talk to you too!

03:57.695 --> 04:00.031
He meant me. Sheesh, what is up with you?

04:00.114 --> 04:03.326
Nothing! Nothing.
I am being totally normal.

04:03.409 --> 04:05.119

04:05.203 --> 04:06.037
Yes.

Don't worry, Koto,
they can't get past our wall.

04:27.517 --> 04:32.146
The design is ingenious. See?
There's only one way in or out

04:32.230 --> 04:35.441
and that's this door right here.

It's your horde that's
been attacking everyone?

05:09.309 --> 05:12.603
Koto! Why? Why are you doing this?

05:12.687 --> 05:16.733
Well, [sighs] long story, really.
When I became king of the mountain lemurs,

05:16.816 --> 05:17.900
we were very wealthy.

05:17.984 --> 05:19.736
-Hmm. Huh?
-I immediately spent all of my kingdom's

05:19.819 --> 05:20.778
money and resources

05:20.862 --> 05:22.739
-on building up our military
-[growls]

05:22.822 --> 05:25.783
until there was nothing left
for food or education.

05:25.867 --> 05:27.535
-Bah, who needs that stuff.
-Huh?

05:27.618 --> 05:30.455
Real trouble was, we didn't have a war.

05:30.538 --> 05:33.583
I had to attack somebody,
and one war led to the next,

05:33.666 --> 05:35.418
-and the next, and the next
-[whimpering]

05:35.501 --> 05:37.754
and, here I am, taking over your kingdom.

05:37.837 --> 05:41.924
But, I thought we were buds.
We fought a snake together, dude!

05:42.008 --> 05:45.261
Sorry, Julien. But you did show me
how beautiful and unprotected

05:45.344 --> 05:46.471
-your kingdom was, so...
-[all whimper]

05:46.554 --> 05:49.140

-[grunts angrily]

05:51.851 --> 05:52.685
Sorry.

05:52.769 --> 05:56.522
But Benson's right.
You really left me no choice.

05:56.606 --> 06:01.194
Please, don't fight back. You can't win.
I'm saying this as a friend.

06:01.277 --> 06:04.989
Hate to break it to you, friend,
but we've got Clover.

06:05.073 --> 06:10.328
Yeah, she's kinda like a superhero
and-and she's never gonna let you...

06:10.411 --> 06:11.996
Wait. Where's Clover?

06:12.080 --> 06:14.040
Get your hands off of me!

06:14.123 --> 06:18.086
Okay, yeah, so you got Clover.
Big deal, that's one.

06:18.169 --> 06:20.421
You know how many people
we have in this kingdom?

06:20.505 --> 06:25.718
[stutters] Look around...
We got-We got Pancho, Horst, Ted.

06:25.802 --> 06:28.096
They're tied up right now. Uh... pbht!

06:28.179 --> 06:32.600

look too good right now. So?

-[swords clang]

06:38.106 --> 06:42.235

can take whatever you want,

No. I will take whatever I want
and your people will be my slaves.

-That's how conquests work.
-[laughs]

What do you say you let me out?

I warmed my booty by a fire he made.

Let us out of here, Koto!

-No.
-Pretty quick response right there.

about that "no" for a second?

-No.
-Yeah, see, you, you don't need

-Sure, whatever.
-So, there is no plan?

10:02.184 --> 10:05.896
Maybe there would be a plan if somebody
stopped asking me so many questions

10:05.980 --> 10:08.065
and let the royal brains think!

10:08.149 --> 10:12.236
In keeping with tradition, I, the victor,

10:12.320 --> 10:16.991
offer you, the vanquished,
one last request.

10:17.074 --> 10:19.410
-Any request?
-Mm-hmm.

10:19.493 --> 10:21.996
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. [exclaims]

10:22.079 --> 10:26.500
I, the vanquished, request a dance-off!

10:26.584 --> 10:30.004
Hmm? A dance-off? That is unusual.

10:30.630 --> 10:33.966
Yeah. Like, really unusual.
[grunts] Sorry.

10:34.050 --> 10:38.638
You said I get one last request
and that's my request. A dance-off.

10:38.721 --> 10:44.018
And if I win said dance-off,
you will let my peoples go free

10:44.101 --> 10:47.271
and I will sacrifice myself willingly.

10:47.355 --> 10:48.939
And if you lose?

10:49.023 --> 10:54.904
Then I die anyway. Pretty much a win-win
for you, so, you're welcome.

10:55.613 --> 10:57.156
Hmm. So be it!

10:57.782 --> 11:00.743
Uh, let the dance battle begin!

11:02.411 --> 11:03.704
[automated voice]  Versus.

Hey! [grunting]

11:09.001 --> 11:10.086
Oh, yeah.

11:13.881 --> 11:14.924
Ha-hey! Hey-hey!

11:15.883 --> 11:16.884
Check it out!

11:16.967 --> 11:18.177
[grunting]

11:18.844 --> 11:20.805
-Ha-hey!
-[cheers, laughs]

11:21.931 --> 11:22.890
Mm-hmm.

11:22.973 --> 11:24.475
[classical music playing]

11:24.558 --> 11:25.726
Uh. Wha--

[dance music playing]

11:37.405 --> 11:38.739
[gasps]

11:40.825 --> 11:41.951
Oh!

11:45.996 --> 11:47.206
[automated voice]  Deal with it!

[groans]

12:35.629 --> 12:37.465
[automated voice]  KO!

12:37.548 --> 12:38.424
Uh.

12:38.507 --> 12:41.760
Your underestimation of my
twerkalicious dance skills

12:41.844 --> 12:44.263
has sealed your fate. [pants]

12:44.346 --> 12:48.684
Amongst our kind,
every warrior takes years of dance.

12:48.767 --> 12:52.480
[chuckles] It gets you totally ripped!
[grunts] Sorry!

12:53.063 --> 12:58.235
King Julien and his advisor
will be fed to the giant snake at dawn!

12:58.319 --> 12:59.653

13:08.787 --> 13:09.663
[shouts] Sage!

13:09.747 --> 13:12.833
Why did you do that?
I could've stopped Koto!

13:12.917 --> 13:17.505
A single grain of sand cannot push
the frothing wave back into the sea.

13:17.588 --> 13:20.716
[grunt] Look, I know I was outnumbered
but I-- [stuttering]

13:20.799 --> 13:24.887
Oh, wow, think I'm actually starting
to understand you.

13:24.970 --> 13:26.472
-And I, you.
-Ha!

13:26.555 --> 13:30.559
No, Sage, if you understood me,
you would have let me do my job!

13:30.643 --> 13:34.438
Instead, you picked me up and flew me
halfway across the [echoes] island!

13:34.522 --> 13:36.106
[scream echoes]

13:36.857 --> 13:40.528
The acrid smell of anger
burns in the nostril of time.

13:40.945 --> 13:43.197
Are you angry with me?

13:43.280 --> 13:47.993
Ugh! [shouts] Yes, Sage, I am angry
with you. How has that not been clear?

13:48.077 --> 13:50.538
Then I am angry at me too. [grunts]

13:50.621 --> 13:54.959
[grunting]

13:55.042 --> 13:57.962
Oh, okay, S-- Sage! That's not--
You don't have to--

13:58.045 --> 14:00.130
Okay, stop it! Give me the-- [stuttering]

14:00.214 --> 14:02.675
[shouts] Stop it now! I have to go.

14:02.758 --> 14:05.844
-Where?
-I have to go back and help King Julien,

14:05.928 --> 14:08.597
so, please,
do not get in the way this time.

14:08.681 --> 14:10.558
I just hope I'm not too late.

14:12.226 --> 14:14.770

14:28.033 --> 14:32.496
I never liked that Koto.
Not one bit. Very dark energy.

14:32.580 --> 14:33.914
Who's Koto again?

14:33.998 --> 14:39.837
The one feeding King Julien
and Maurice to a snake at dawn!

14:40.504 --> 14:44.174
Oh, it's just too much to bear! [cries]

14:44.258 --> 14:48.387
No! No one feeds
my King Julien to a snake!

14:48.888 --> 14:52.308
[grunting]

14:52.391 --> 14:53.976
[exclaims, farts]

14:54.059 --> 14:59.315
If we all push, we could get out
of here and help King Julien.

14:59.899 --> 15:03.235
We can't. There's no way
we can beat the mountain lemurs.

15:03.319 --> 15:07.740
I mean, have you seen those guys?
They work out a lot.

15:07.823 --> 15:11.952
You know, I know I've said this before,
Mort, but I think we better face it.

15:12.453 --> 15:15.581
-We're all gonna die.
-[all gasp, screaming]

-[gasps]
-[kissing]

15:20.878 --> 15:26.884
Hey! Fine, if you all won't help me,
I'll save King Julien by myself!

15:26.967 --> 15:29.762
[grunting]

15:31.555 --> 15:34.183
Hmm. Poor little guy's delusional.

15:35.309 --> 15:38.771
[playing mouth organ]

15:43.108 --> 15:45.027
This is all my fault, Maurice.

15:46.278 --> 15:48.113
[clears throat, coughs]

15:48.197 --> 15:49.239
-Uh...
-[chuckles]

15:49.323 --> 15:51.116
Am I supposed to say something?

15:51.200 --> 15:55.788
Don't try to be nice and say it isn't
all my fault just to make me feel better!

15:55.871 --> 15:56.705
I wasn't.

15:56.789 --> 16:00.668
Stop making excuses for me!
I'm the one who let Koto in.

16:00.751 --> 16:02.419
I'm the one who trusted him.

16:03.003 --> 16:06.090
Although, you're right,
I wasn't the only one who trusted him.

16:06.256 --> 16:10.177
Clover was fooled by Koto, too. Mo-mo?

16:11.387 --> 16:14.223
-[whimpers]
-I'm sorry.

16:14.306 --> 16:16.725
I'm sorry, too, Your Majesty.

16:18.310 --> 16:21.689
And for what it's worth,
despite the fact that we're about to die,

16:21.772 --> 16:24.149
I'm proud of the king you've become.

16:24.233 --> 16:25.401
[sniffs]

16:26.276 --> 16:28.779
Sadly, that doesn't help at all.

-Oh.

16:45.421 --> 16:47.256
Nothing yet! Oh, no.

-Goodbye, Maurice.

17:12.281 --> 17:14.199
Goodbye, King Julien.

Oh, this is it. I can't watch.

17:41.310 --> 17:45.689
I can't believe it! Mort's in the ring!
I repeat, Mort's in the ring!

17:45.773 --> 17:46.857
Yeah! How about that?

17:46.940 --> 17:50.903
-Hey, Snake, don't I look tasty?
-[hissing]

17:50.986 --> 17:52.654
-Uh...
-[grunts]

17:52.738 --> 17:56.075
Look. So juicy.

17:56.158 --> 17:57.618
Want me to go get him?

17:57.701 --> 18:00.496
No. He will be eaten soon enough.

18:00.579 --> 18:01.872
[giggles]

18:03.791 --> 18:05.751
Mort's distracting the snake!

-[snarls]
-Oh!

18:09.588 --> 18:13.050
Mort, quit playing around,
and get over here and untie us!

18:13.133 --> 18:16.095
So small and yet, so brave.

18:16.178 --> 18:18.597
Maybe we should help too!

18:18.680 --> 18:23.185
Yeah! I mean, we're gonna
die anyway, so might as well, right?

18:23.268 --> 18:27.106
-Okay, fine. Let's do this! Let's--
-Build a maze?

18:27.189 --> 18:30.275
No, you idiot. Let's bust down this door!

Uh! If we can get to the submarine,
King Julien, I can get you out of here.

-No, Pancho. I can't leave my peoples.
-[clamoring]

19:31.336 --> 19:33.630
King Julien, there's no way
we can take on the mountain lemurs.

19:33.714 --> 19:35.007
-[Pancho] This way!
-We need to get out of here,

19:35.090 --> 19:36.967
so we can get help! Make a plan!

19:37.050 --> 19:38.010
Oh!

Goodbye, Mort.

20:11.168 --> 20:12.544

20:13.253 --> 20:16.256
Hurry, Pancho. We gotta get King Julien
out of here!

-Punch it!

-Hey, now!

20:21.428 --> 20:23.931

20:25.974 --> 20:28.560
[grunts] Huh? [gasps]

20:32.064 --> 20:33.357

20:34.191 --> 20:35.234
[Clover] King Julien!

[grunting]

20:38.862 --> 20:41.156
[clanging]

20:43.742 --> 20:46.536
Are all of the prisoners
back in their cage?

20:46.620 --> 20:50.958
Yes, but, uh, King Julien has escaped.

20:51.041 --> 20:51.959
Huh?

20:52.042 --> 20:54.962
Shall I dispatch a search party
to go after him?

20:55.045 --> 20:57.673
King Julien is a king no longer.

20:57.756 --> 21:01.843
He has no crown, no home,
and is no threat. Forget him.

21:01.927 --> 21:04.805
Soon he will be nothing more
than a long forgotten memory.

21:04.888 --> 21:07.724
Uh, can he be a memory if he's forgotten?

21:07.808 --> 21:09.977
-'Cause, like, [stutters] to be a memory,
-[growls]

21:10.060 --> 21:11.103
you'd have to be remembered,

21:11.186 --> 21:14.398
which he wouldn't be if he was forgotten,
and so I was-- Sorry.

21:14.481 --> 21:16.483

-Ow! [grunts]

21:23.323 --> 21:24.157
Mmm.

[laughs]

21:28.662 --> 21:29.496
[gasps]

21:30.163 --> 21:33.208
-This is all my fault.
-[grunts] Hmm.

21:33.292 --> 21:37.921
I have to do something.
I have to free all the prisoners.

21:38.005 --> 21:41.258
I have to make Koto pay.

21:41.341 --> 21:42.759
[grunts]

21:42.843 --> 21:47.764
I will make this right,
even if it means I die in the process.

21:47.848 --> 21:51.143
The larvae of the soul
can only be eaten once.

21:51.852 --> 21:54.479
We will find a way once you are full.

21:55.856 --> 21:57.024
[sighs in relief]

21:57.107 --> 22:00.777
You're right, I can't fight Koto
and the mountain lemurs alone.

22:01.820 --> 22:04.823
I hate to say this
but I need your help, Sage.
