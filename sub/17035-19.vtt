00:01.373 --> 00:03.907
[Crow caws]

00:04.930 --> 00:07.797
So I ran into Reverend Hayver
at the Frugal Hoosier.

00:07.899 --> 00:10.667
Nothing good ever comes
after <i> that</i> sentence.

00:10.769 --> 00:13.603
[Sighs] Yeah, well,
he not-so-subtly reminded me

00:13.705 --> 00:15.005
that we never had Brick confirmed.

00:15.039 --> 00:17.440
We were supposed to have him
confirmed two years ago, Mike.

00:17.542 --> 00:19.308
In the eyes of God, that's pretty bad.

00:19.410 --> 00:21.110
Well, I seem to be fine so far.

00:21.212 --> 00:23.412
That's debatable.
So, did you push him off?

00:23.514 --> 00:25.948
Well, I tried to, but he cornered me,

00:26.050 --> 00:28.050
and I started making up excuses.

00:28.152 --> 00:29.151
"Oh, I was sick."

00:29.253 --> 00:30.519
"There was a whole thing with my mom."

00:30.621 --> 00:33.255
Look, I went down a road,
and long story short,

00:33.357 --> 00:35.624
there's a ceremony next week,
and Brick's doin' it.

00:35.727 --> 00:37.526
What?! I'm not prepared!

00:37.628 --> 00:39.895
How am I gonna learn
all that stuff in a week?

00:39.997 --> 00:41.430
You stopped driving me to Sunday school.

00:41.532 --> 00:42.565
You told me to watch 15 minutes

00:42.667 --> 00:44.100
of "Hour of Power" and let you sleep.

00:44.202 --> 00:46.469
Don't worry. I got ahead of it.

00:46.571 --> 00:48.137
I already called Reverend TimTom.

00:48.239 --> 00:50.639
Now, he doesn't do privates,
but we're in luck

00:50.742 --> 00:53.843
'cause this week he's hosting
the Wilderness Jesus Jam.

00:53.945 --> 00:55.748
You lost me at "wilderness."

00:55.773 --> 00:56.786

00:58.486 --> 00:59.873
Okay, look,

00:59.951 --> 01:02.118
you know I would <i> never</i> break
a confidence,

01:02.220 --> 01:04.319
but I'm gonna break my
no-confidence-breaking rule

01:04.422 --> 01:06.122
just this once and confide in you

01:06.224 --> 01:08.357
'cause I think our friend
really needs our help.

01:08.459 --> 01:11.193
I think Lexie hasn't been
herself lately because...

01:11.295 --> 01:13.796
- She's crushing on Axl.
- How did you know that?

01:13.898 --> 01:16.165
Oh, please, every time
he comes over to do laundry,

01:16.267 --> 01:17.933
she wearthat top that
shows off her shoulders.

01:18.035 --> 01:20.436
Plus, she does that move
where she piles her hair up

01:20.538 --> 01:22.204
and lets it fall, like...

01:22.306 --> 01:24.759
Nobody takes that many tries
to put their hair up.

01:24.784 --> 01:25.701
She knows where her hair is.

01:25.779 --> 01:27.643
Wow. That is <i> impressive!</i>

Your straight-dar is really good.

First of all, shut up. I do <i> not.</i>

01:38.389 --> 01:40.189
And second of all,
how did you know that?

01:40.291 --> 01:41.791
Anytime someone mentions his name,

01:41.893 --> 01:43.425
you get this goofy smile on your face.

01:43.528 --> 01:44.894
Whenever he came to your house
in high school,

01:44.996 --> 01:46.295
you took your retainer out.

01:46.397 --> 01:48.397
And you told me you liked him
that night we tried wine.

01:48.499 --> 01:50.232
Okay, well, that's a conversation

01:50.334 --> 01:51.967
for when we're old enough to drink wine.

01:52.069 --> 01:53.602
Right now we need to focus on Lexie

01:53.704 --> 01:55.938
'cause she needs
some serious cheering-up.

01:56.040 --> 01:57.573
- You've come to the right place.
- Mm-hmm.

01:57.675 --> 01:58.774
What level are we talking about?

01:58.876 --> 02:01.143
Well, she tried to flirt
with Axl over spring break,

02:01.245 --> 02:02.945
and he doesn't even know she's alive.

02:03.047 --> 02:05.614
I mean, think about it,
the girl's gotten everything

02:05.716 --> 02:07.249
she's ever wanted in her whole life,

02:07.351 --> 02:10.186
and the one thing she <i> can't</i> have is Axl?

02:10.288 --> 02:11.887
[Shudders] That's pretty sad.

02:11.989 --> 02:13.389
Wow. That <i> is</i> sad.

Me too. This is awesome.

02:30.474 --> 02:32.675
I mean [chuckles] I want to tell people.

02:32.777 --> 02:34.543
Duh. Why wouldn't I?

02:34.645 --> 02:36.445
Look, it... it's just... with April,

02:36.547 --> 02:38.681
my family got all... up in my business,

02:38.783 --> 02:40.149
and if I tell them about this,

02:40.218 --> 02:42.051
they're gonna think it's too soon,
my parents will get all judgy.

02:42.119 --> 02:44.286
Next thing you know, I'll spite-marry
you, and we'll end up divorced.

02:44.355 --> 02:46.956
Trust me. We'll be much happier
if we just keep this a secret.

02:47.024 --> 02:49.992
Plus my dad just made the final payment
on my annulment, so there's that.

02:50.094 --> 02:51.827
No, I get it.

I'm just bummed.

I'm with such a cute guy,

Well, you can tell <i>that</i> guy.

02:57.802 --> 02:58.701
I like him.

02:58.803 --> 03:00.919
- We like each other.
- Don't care.

03:02.418 --> 03:03.951
That was not satisfying.

03:05.647 --> 03:06.679
All right, happy campers,

No, I believe I was here first.

03:14.022 --> 03:15.221
Would you mind taking the bottom bunk?

03:15.290 --> 03:16.689
I'm scared of enclosed spaces.

03:16.791 --> 03:18.357
Well, I'm scared of being crushed

03:18.459 --> 03:19.892
in a bizarre bunk accident.

03:19.994 --> 03:21.861
Great. Now I'm scared of that, too,

07:52.634 --> 07:55.565
I don't know what the problem
is here, but whatever it is,

07:55.639 --> 07:57.160
I'm sure the Rovin' Rev can help.

07:57.185 --> 07:58.840
Ha. We were switched at birth.

07:58.942 --> 08:00.976
Uh, it was a month
before anyone figured it out.

08:01.078 --> 08:02.244
I assumed he knew all this,

08:02.346 --> 08:03.879
but apparently,
his parents never told him,

08:03.981 --> 08:05.480
and he does not
seem to be taking it well.

08:05.582 --> 08:07.382
[Chord plays]

08:07.484 --> 08:08.583
[Sighs]

08:08.685 --> 08:10.786
I don't have a song for that.

08:10.888 --> 08:12.120
[Sighs]

08:13.824 --> 08:14.890
When's Brick getting home?

08:14.992 --> 08:15.991
I think tomorrow.

08:16.093 --> 08:18.293
- [Door opens]
- There he is!        - Hey!

08:18.395 --> 08:19.761
How was the Jesus Jam?

08:19.863 --> 08:20.862
Brick: It was good.

08:20.931 --> 08:22.497
I learned about the plague of boils,

08:22.599 --> 08:23.999
I memorized the Apostles' Creed,

08:24.101 --> 08:27.035
and participated in some rather
ribald nighttime bunk chat,

08:27.137 --> 08:28.170
where I was informed that third base

08:28.272 --> 08:29.905
is quite a bit further than I thought.

08:30.007 --> 08:31.039
[Coughs]

08:31.141 --> 08:33.942
But... you're never
gonna believe who I met.

08:34.044 --> 08:36.077
[Doorbell rings]

08:38.749 --> 08:41.116
How <i> dare</i> you let your son tell our son

08:41.217 --> 08:42.284
they were switched at birth!

08:42.385 --> 08:44.653
[Chuckles nervously]

08:46.576 --> 08:49.535
<i>Axl decided he wasn't too
concerned about Lexie's date.</i>

08:49.689 --> 08:52.212
<i>After all, he was a friend
of Brad and Sue's.</i>

08:52.314 --> 08:54.492
<i>But he thought he'd
swing by just for fun.</i>

08:55.067 --> 08:56.500
[Axl whistling]

08:56.602 --> 08:58.469
- What?! No, it's not.
- [Chuckles]

08:58.571 --> 09:00.037
[Sighs] Oh, my gosh!

09:00.106 --> 09:02.840
- Hi, guys. What are you doing here?
- Axl.

09:02.908 --> 09:04.341
Just having some dinner
with some friends.

09:04.410 --> 09:06.543
There's no extra chairs.
We already asked. So, bye!

09:06.645 --> 09:07.511
[Chuckles] What's the rush?

09:07.580 --> 09:08.579
I'm sorry. Do I know you?

09:08.647 --> 09:10.614
Hey. I'm one of Brad's friends.

09:10.716 --> 09:13.217
Oh...

09:13.319 --> 09:15.519
Wow, yes. You must be
a theater major, huh?

09:15.588 --> 09:16.954
Acting... that's a tough business.

09:17.022 --> 09:20.217
Hey, what did the theater major
say when he got his degree?

09:20.398 --> 09:21.797
"You want fries with that?"

09:21.866 --> 09:23.032
'Cause he couldn't get a good job.

09:23.134 --> 09:24.767
I don't find that funny.

09:25.703 --> 09:26.936
Actually, I'm a business major.

09:27.038 --> 09:27.937
Oh.

09:28.039 --> 09:30.106
- So am I.
- Oh, yeah?

09:30.174 --> 09:32.749
I'm surprised I haven't seen you
around the business library.

09:32.818 --> 09:35.211
Well, that's not because
I didn't know there was one.

09:35.280 --> 09:38.488
I've been very busy starring
on the football team.

09:38.801 --> 09:40.250
I didn't get your name.

09:40.352 --> 09:41.478
Chester Lansing.

09:41.547 --> 09:44.978
- Oh! The guy who killed two people.
- Chester: No.

09:45.046 --> 09:46.697
- Yeah, I'm pretty sure that was his name.
- [Chuckles nervously]

09:46.766 --> 09:48.625
He got off 'cause they could
never find the murder weapon,

09:48.693 --> 09:50.031
so he's still out there...

09:50.100 --> 09:51.111
somewhere.

09:51.214 --> 09:52.246
Sue: Well...

09:52.315 --> 09:54.890
this has been <i>so</i> awesome catching up,

09:54.959 --> 09:56.851
but we gotta go, so...

09:56.919 --> 09:58.385
Yeah, we're going back to the apartment

09:58.454 --> 09:59.736
to watch a movie and have a nightcap.

09:59.771 --> 10:02.723
And by "nightcap," I mean fruit
juice in champagne glasses.

10:02.825 --> 10:03.791
Mm-hmm.

10:03.893 --> 10:05.292
So, buh-bye!

10:12.201 --> 10:13.834
[Sighs] We sure we want to watch a movie

10:13.936 --> 10:15.302
on a school night?

10:20.643 --> 10:22.109
So, you see, Blake,

10:22.211 --> 10:24.111
it was kind of the hospital's screw-up

10:24.180 --> 10:25.446
because they gave me the room

10:25.515 --> 10:27.081
that your mom was supposed to get.

10:27.149 --> 10:29.617
[Chuckling] That's why they thought
there were two baby Fergusons.

10:29.685 --> 10:30.951
Hmm.

10:31.433 --> 10:33.787
My mom says you took her room
'cause it was nicer.

10:34.385 --> 10:36.276
Well, yes, technically,

10:36.301 --> 10:37.600
but we didn't ask for the room,

10:37.669 --> 10:40.503
so what we did was wrong,
but it wasn't <i> bad.</i>

10:40.572 --> 10:42.271
See, there are
different levels of wrong.

10:42.340 --> 10:43.973
This is what we call "light wrong."

10:44.075 --> 10:45.108
If I had stayed your mom,

10:45.210 --> 10:47.510
I would have explained this to you.

10:47.612 --> 10:49.412
What's important to remember, Blake,

10:49.514 --> 10:50.746
is that the authorities determined

10:50.815 --> 10:52.081
that we were not to blame.

10:52.183 --> 10:53.416
It was these people.

10:53.518 --> 10:56.519
Well, not exactly <i> people.</i>

10:56.588 --> 10:58.621
Actually, it was this one's fault

10:58.723 --> 10:59.989
for watching the football game

11:00.058 --> 11:02.358
and not paying attention
to which baby was his.

11:02.427 --> 11:04.827
Well, shame on me for expecting a mother

11:04.929 --> 11:06.796
to recognize her own baby.

11:07.287 --> 11:08.686
It's not called <i>father's</i> intuition.

11:08.788 --> 11:10.922
Fathers are supposed to watch
the game and smoke cigars,

11:10.991 --> 11:12.056
which is what I did.

11:12.158 --> 11:14.325
Well, we don't like
to dwell on the past.

11:14.394 --> 11:15.994
Seems like you do 'cause
you drove all the way

11:16.062 --> 11:17.629
across town to do it. [Chuckles]

11:17.731 --> 11:20.064
People who steal babies
shouldn't throw stones.

11:20.166 --> 11:21.165
[Exhales sharply]

11:21.201 --> 11:23.635
But as long as the cat's out of the bag,

11:23.737 --> 11:25.036
you might as well have this.

11:25.138 --> 11:27.372
It's your baby book.

11:27.998 --> 11:29.274
It is?

11:29.551 --> 11:31.889
You kept a book? Of me?

11:32.763 --> 11:34.098
Wow.

11:34.373 --> 11:36.325
You gave me a one-month birthday party?

11:36.446 --> 11:37.878
Well, you were our first.

11:37.947 --> 11:39.814
We went a little overboard.

11:39.882 --> 11:42.817
I know most parents don't
celebrate one-month birthdays.

11:42.919 --> 11:45.219
Some don't even
celebrate <i> actual</i> birthdays.

11:45.321 --> 11:46.120
[Sighs]

11:46.222 --> 11:48.155
So do you have my baby book?

11:49.204 --> 11:50.791
Of course, but...

11:51.413 --> 11:54.195
our basement recently flooded, and...

11:54.263 --> 11:56.301
shoot, Mike, was Blake's baby book

11:56.326 --> 11:57.555
with the panda on the cover

11:57.580 --> 11:59.275
in the box that we lost in the flood?

11:59.377 --> 12:01.074
- It was.
- [Sighs]

12:01.176 --> 12:03.389
And all those home movies
we took of him? - Yep.

12:03.449 --> 12:06.040
Please tell me the portrait we had
painted of him wasn't... - Same box.

12:06.142 --> 12:07.274
Oh.

12:07.943 --> 12:10.195
Brick: "His favorite book
is 'Good Night, Gorilla'.

12:10.222 --> 12:12.722
Every time we read it to him,
he kicks his little legs."

12:12.824 --> 12:15.225
And here's a picture of you
reading it to me!

12:15.327 --> 12:16.793
What was my favorite book?

12:16.895 --> 12:19.028
Yeah, we'd love to know.

12:19.890 --> 12:21.697
Well, yes, of course.

12:22.178 --> 12:24.134
You loved...

12:24.594 --> 12:27.370
Loni Anderson's "My Life in High Heels."

12:27.472 --> 12:28.805
I skipped the Burt Reynolds parts.

12:28.907 --> 12:29.973
[Chuckles] Too racy.

12:30.041 --> 12:31.841
That's the kind of mom I am...
overprotective.

12:31.943 --> 12:33.728
[Growls, chuckles]

12:33.948 --> 12:36.074
Brick: "November 12, 2001.

12:36.247 --> 12:37.713
It snowed today.

12:37.815 --> 12:39.315
We cozied up in the reading nook

12:39.417 --> 12:40.583
with our beautiful boy

12:40.651 --> 12:42.551
and listened to classical music."

12:43.003 --> 12:44.520
I had a reading nook?

12:44.589 --> 12:46.655
I listened to classical music?

12:46.757 --> 12:49.024
You know, I've always loved
classical music,

12:49.093 --> 12:51.860
but my "dad" calls it dentist music.

12:51.929 --> 12:55.297
Wow. So much of who I am
is finally making sense to me.

12:55.366 --> 12:58.237
Well, there's one more thing
we have for you.

12:59.370 --> 13:00.636
Mr. Ribbits.

13:00.738 --> 13:02.404
Come on!

13:02.440 --> 13:04.940
We have one more thing for you, as well.

13:05.042 --> 13:07.309
You loved...

13:07.411 --> 13:09.979
this Colts towel.

13:10.081 --> 13:12.381
Uh... are you sure about that, Frankie?

13:12.450 --> 13:16.232
I don't remember Blake
liking <i> my</i> lucky Colts towel

13:16.257 --> 13:17.789
that if I'm not holding it
when they play,

13:17.892 --> 13:19.267
the Colts don't win.

13:19.292 --> 13:20.926
I think what he really loved

13:21.028 --> 13:23.896
was your commemorative
Royal Family plate.

13:23.998 --> 13:25.130
Are you sure, Mike?

13:25.232 --> 13:26.832
Because that plate
is worth a lot of money,

13:26.934 --> 13:27.966
and this towel is worthless.

13:28.068 --> 13:29.601
Yeah, but I remember early on,

13:29.637 --> 13:31.136
we taught the boy
that there are some things

13:31.238 --> 13:32.304
that are more important than money,

13:32.406 --> 13:35.207
like magical towels
that help the Colts win.

13:38.279 --> 13:39.811
[Sniffs]

13:40.626 --> 13:41.926
I like it.

13:42.716 --> 13:44.149
Well...

13:44.251 --> 13:46.585
we've got a lot of packing to do.

13:46.687 --> 13:49.021
Yes, uh, my husband's
taking a sabbatical

13:49.089 --> 13:50.529
from the university,

13:50.553 --> 13:52.675
and we're going
on a month-long family trip

13:52.711 --> 13:55.243
to visit the birthplaces
of great American authors.

13:55.268 --> 13:56.134
[Whimpers]

13:56.254 --> 13:57.319
Let's go, son.

13:59.076 --> 14:00.442
[Sighs]

14:02.026 --> 14:03.559
Brick!

14:09.700 --> 14:11.033
Those are nice socks.

14:11.525 --> 14:13.150
Do you know if they
make them for guys, or...?

14:13.218 --> 14:16.005
Axl! Can you help me with
the fruit juice, please?

14:19.119 --> 14:20.986
What are you doing? You're acting crazy.

14:21.088 --> 14:24.122
Am I? I'm not the one who's kissing
one guy and dating another.

14:24.191 --> 14:26.324
What am I supposed to do?
You don't want to tell anyone.

14:26.360 --> 14:27.392
I don't even like Chester.

14:27.494 --> 14:28.860
Oh, of course you do.

14:28.929 --> 14:30.228
He's exactly like me, only better.

14:30.330 --> 14:31.296
He's Better Axl.

14:31.398 --> 14:33.165
He's better-looking,
he's better at business,

14:33.267 --> 14:34.533
he's better at being tall.

14:34.635 --> 14:35.967
Why are you acting so crazy?

14:36.036 --> 14:37.202
You know I like you.

14:37.304 --> 14:38.403
That's the problem...

14:38.472 --> 14:40.257
you like me, so you're gonna
like him even more.

14:40.359 --> 14:42.007
You might like generic ice cream,

14:42.076 --> 14:44.138
but if someone gives you
Haagen-Dazs, you're gonna take it.

14:44.207 --> 14:45.559
I didn't think you
were the jealous type.

14:45.628 --> 14:48.337
Only when it comes to myself,
which he is.

14:48.591 --> 14:49.623
Brad, what are we gonna do?

14:49.725 --> 14:51.525
Lexie's practically throwing
herself at Axl.

14:51.627 --> 14:52.926
I know. It's so sad.

14:53.028 --> 14:54.728
When someone's not into you,
you have to move on.

14:54.797 --> 14:56.263
You got to look at yourself
in the mirror and say,

14:56.332 --> 14:58.332
"Ricky Martin is happily married
with two kids.

14:58.400 --> 14:59.833
It's not worth the stamps, Bradley."

14:59.902 --> 15:01.535
We got to get her away from him.

15:01.604 --> 15:04.538
Lexie, could I see you
in the bathroom for a...

15:04.640 --> 15:06.239
[speaks gibberish]

15:08.844 --> 15:09.910
[Chuckles]

15:10.012 --> 15:10.944
Okay, look!

15:11.046 --> 15:12.379
I am trying to help my friend here,

15:12.448 --> 15:15.015
who, for some reason,
finds <i> you</i> attractive,

15:15.117 --> 15:16.383
and you lurking around here

15:16.485 --> 15:18.418
isn't making anything any easier.

15:18.520 --> 15:20.053
So you need to go! Now!

15:20.122 --> 15:21.521
[Sighs]

15:22.391 --> 15:23.890
Beat it. Tsst!

15:23.993 --> 15:27.461
Well, you heard her. Hit the bricks.

15:27.563 --> 15:29.712
I think she was talking to you.

15:29.781 --> 15:31.883
It looks that way,
but she's got a lazy eye.

15:32.368 --> 15:33.800
Okay, I'm gonna level with you.

15:34.419 --> 15:36.786
I like Lexie and Lexie likes me,
but it's a secret.

15:36.889 --> 15:39.122
So bottom line, I'm gonna ask you

15:39.224 --> 15:40.657
to do something that I would <i> never</i> do,

15:40.726 --> 15:43.293
but you're better than me,
so maybe you'll do it.

15:43.395 --> 15:44.861
I need you to leave.

15:45.831 --> 15:47.158
Okay.

15:48.000 --> 15:49.132
Seriously?

15:49.268 --> 15:50.967
Wow. You really are better than me.

15:51.069 --> 15:52.636
You guys already have a thing going on.

15:52.738 --> 15:53.904
I don't want to mess with it.

15:53.972 --> 15:55.205
I get it.

15:56.308 --> 15:57.407
[Chuckles]

15:57.476 --> 16:00.343
I never thought I could love
anyone more than myself.

16:00.412 --> 16:03.180
You know, Lexie deserves a guy like you,

16:03.282 --> 16:05.348
or a guy just a little bit worse.

16:05.417 --> 16:07.617
[Chuckles]

16:07.719 --> 16:09.386
