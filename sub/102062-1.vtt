00:01.211 --> 00:04.128
(cricket chirping)

00:38.349 --> 00:40.932
(lively music)

02:30.770 --> 02:31.883
- Morning, baby.

02:32.840 --> 02:34.290
What do you want to do today?

02:35.178 --> 02:36.010
(Jody chuckles)

02:36.011 --> 02:36.844
Me?

02:37.760 --> 02:40.503
Well, if it was up to me,

02:41.580 --> 02:44.889
you and me would just stay in bed all day,

02:44.890 --> 02:48.733
underneath the covers,
safe from the world.

02:49.740 --> 02:51.170
Just you and me.

02:54.245 --> 02:55.660
(camera snaps)
- Boom, gotcha kissing

02:55.661 --> 02:56.775
your pillow, you freak!
- Get the fuck out,

02:56.776 --> 02:58.415
you bastard!
- Yeah, you freak!

02:58.416 --> 03:00.059
- [Donny] Jody Sue looks like poo!

03:00.060 --> 03:02.267
- I'm gonna kill you bastards!
- Jody Sue looks like poo!

03:02.268 --> 03:04.350
Jody Sue looks like poo!

03:04.351 --> 03:08.019
(footsteps pattering)

03:08.020 --> 03:08.852
- [Bill] Whoa, whoa, whoa!

03:08.853 --> 03:10.699
Slow down there, cowboys!

03:10.700 --> 03:12.386
- [Donny] Dad, Jody said
she was gonna kill us.

03:12.387 --> 03:13.219
- No.
- Yeah, and she used

03:13.220 --> 03:15.984
the F word too.
- Shut up!

03:15.985 --> 03:16.817
- And she was kissing

03:16.818 --> 03:18.359
her pillow.
- No, I wasn't!

03:18.360 --> 03:19.919
- Enough! Donny, Davey, zip!

03:19.920 --> 03:20.752
Sit, eat.

03:20.753 --> 03:22.819
And you, ease up on the
melodrama, will you?

03:22.820 --> 03:24.089
Kissing your pillow is not

03:24.090 --> 03:25.939
the most embarrassing
thing they could have

03:25.940 --> 03:26.932
caught you doing.
- Ew, Dad!

03:26.933 --> 03:29.089
Why do you always take their side?!

03:29.090 --> 03:31.209
- The only side I'm taking is the side

03:31.210 --> 03:33.059
that causes me the least amount of stress.

03:33.060 --> 03:34.389
What do you want for breakfast?

03:34.390 --> 03:35.809
- A lock on my door!

03:35.810 --> 03:37.499
- [Bill] People in hell want ice water.

03:37.500 --> 03:38.893
- What does that even mean?!

03:38.894 --> 03:40.621
- [Donny] It means you
smell like used underwear-

03:40.622 --> 03:41.845
- That's so funny! Ew!

03:41.846 --> 03:44.269
- Hey, that's it!
- Ugh, this place sucks!

03:44.270 --> 03:45.102
- Yep.
- Woo-hoo!

03:45.103 --> 03:47.033
- Too bad you're stuck here forever!

03:47.034 --> 03:49.432
(all laughing)

03:49.433 --> 03:52.016
(bright music)

05:32.686 --> 05:35.436
(Hannah sighing)

05:47.286 --> 05:50.036
(Hannah sighing)

05:58.685 --> 06:01.852
(gentle guitar music)

06:27.196 --> 06:30.096
- Lord, if you're up there, I
could use some Goddamn help.

06:32.370 --> 06:36.297
Apologies. Probably coulda
phrased that better.

06:47.735 --> 06:50.568
(water splashing)

06:54.367 --> 06:57.450
(hairdryer whirring)

07:11.624 --> 07:14.207
(Hannah sighs)

07:16.083 --> 07:21.083
(locks clacking)
(truck beeps)

07:34.025 --> 07:36.025
Get the hell outta here.

07:59.350 --> 08:00.183
Hi.

08:03.070 --> 08:03.903
- Hi.

08:04.860 --> 08:07.443
- I passed you when I was out
running earlier this morning.

08:08.580 --> 08:09.413
- Okay.

08:11.144 --> 08:13.769
- Have you been running all
this time without a stop?

08:13.770 --> 08:14.913
- Yeah. Why?

08:15.970 --> 08:17.219
- Nothing. I'm just a track coach.

08:17.220 --> 08:19.257
I was impressed by your stamina.

08:19.258 --> 08:20.091
- Oh.

08:21.340 --> 08:22.925
Thanks.

08:22.926 --> 08:24.319
- You want something to drink?

08:24.320 --> 08:25.153
- [Jody] Sure.

08:29.900 --> 08:31.550
- Do you run like this every day?

08:33.700 --> 08:35.339
- Yeah, couple times a week.

08:35.340 --> 08:37.190
- But always for this amount of time?

08:38.070 --> 08:39.609
- Yeah, I just run till I get tired

08:39.610 --> 08:40.910
and then I head back home.

08:44.950 --> 08:46.000
Thanks for the drink.

08:47.090 --> 08:48.239
- Sure. Hey.

08:48.240 --> 08:50.269
You got someplace you
got to be right away?

08:50.270 --> 08:51.859
- Why?

08:51.860 --> 08:53.599
- How about I take you
down to The Wagon Wheel?

08:53.600 --> 08:54.919
I'll buy you some lunch.

08:54.920 --> 08:56.873
I'd like to talk to you
more about your running.

08:58.910 --> 08:59.760
- I don't get it.

09:00.890 --> 09:01.889
- There's nothing to get.

09:01.890 --> 09:04.240
I just always have my
eye out for new athletes.

09:06.220 --> 09:08.181
- Is this some kinda weird sex thing?

09:08.182 --> 09:09.669
(Hannah scoffs)

09:09.670 --> 09:10.620
- Get in the truck.

09:23.520 --> 09:25.039
I'm Hannah, by the way.

09:25.040 --> 09:25.873
- Jody.

09:27.670 --> 09:28.770
So where do you coach?

09:31.270 --> 09:32.849
- I'm currently between jobs,

09:32.850 --> 09:35.173
but I haven't lost my eye for talent.

09:37.807 --> 09:39.419
You ever run track before?

09:39.420 --> 09:41.620
- Yeah, I did a little
bit in middle school.

09:42.620 --> 09:43.809
I was good, nothing great.

09:43.810 --> 09:44.899
- What event?

09:44.900 --> 09:46.868
- [Jody] 400-meter, mostly.

09:46.869 --> 09:48.349
- Oh, well, there's your
problem right there.

09:48.350 --> 09:49.599
You're not a short-distance sprinter,

09:49.600 --> 09:51.359
you're a long-distance endurance runner.

09:51.360 --> 09:53.510
Could tell that the
second I saw your legs.

09:54.490 --> 09:57.599
- Are you sure this isn't
some weird sex thing?

09:57.600 --> 09:58.433
- Quite sure.

09:59.740 --> 10:02.079
So do you think you might be interested

10:02.080 --> 10:03.530
in some running competitions?

10:04.670 --> 10:08.593
- I never really thought about
it, but I might be, yeah.

10:10.220 --> 10:11.616
- All right, then.

10:11.617 --> 10:15.479
(turn signal clicking)

10:15.480 --> 10:17.789
You know where Apex Point is?

10:17.790 --> 10:18.623
- Yeah.

10:19.670 --> 10:22.623
- Give or take, that is
about 5,000 meters from here.

10:23.660 --> 10:25.029
If you're any good, you
should be able to get there

10:25.030 --> 10:26.889
in under 24 minutes.

10:26.890 --> 10:27.729
Give me your best shot.

10:27.730 --> 10:28.719
- Now?

10:28.720 --> 10:29.979
- [Hannah] Yes, now.

10:29.980 --> 10:31.329
- [Jody] What about lunch?

10:31.330 --> 10:32.929
- After.

10:32.930 --> 10:36.359
- This is starting to smell
like some serious bullshit.

10:36.360 --> 10:38.299
- Oh, come on, when was the
last time you impressed anyone

10:38.300 --> 10:39.950
with anything besides your looks?

10:44.640 --> 10:45.899
- Are you gonna run with me?

10:45.900 --> 10:48.609
- Shit, no. I'm gonna drive
down there and wait for you.

10:48.610 --> 10:50.760
Clock starts the second
you open that door.

10:53.687 --> 10:55.649
(Jody sighs)

10:55.650 --> 10:57.279
- Fine.

10:57.280 --> 10:58.113
Screw it!

10:59.297 --> 11:01.130
- That's the attitude.

11:02.868 --> 11:05.285
(door thuds)

11:16.135 --> 11:18.718
(mellow music)

12:42.774 --> 12:44.107
- Goddess alert.

12:51.480 --> 12:53.019
Hey. Jody.

12:53.020 --> 12:53.909
- Hi.

12:53.910 --> 12:54.742
- I'm Tim.

12:54.743 --> 12:56.309
We had Steinecke's creative
writing class together.

12:56.310 --> 12:58.389
- No, yeah, I remember you.

12:58.390 --> 13:00.199
What are you doing out here?

13:00.200 --> 13:01.032
- Writing.

13:01.033 --> 13:03.009
Sometimes, need to get
away from the internet

13:03.010 --> 13:05.279
and technology and just people in general.

13:05.280 --> 13:06.929
That's when I do my best work.

13:06.930 --> 13:09.009
What about you? What are you doing here?

13:09.010 --> 13:09.843
- Running.

13:10.760 --> 13:12.539
- Right, yeah. Sorry.

13:12.540 --> 13:13.373
Stupid question.

13:14.880 --> 13:16.619
Hey, can we stop for a second?

13:16.620 --> 13:18.329
- I can't. I'm being timed.

13:18.330 --> 13:19.839
- Oh.

13:19.840 --> 13:20.673
Cool.

13:22.680 --> 13:23.880
Can I call you sometime?

13:25.230 --> 13:27.369
- Yeah, if you want to.

13:27.370 --> 13:28.639
- Okay.
(Jody laughs)

13:28.640 --> 13:29.473
Great.

13:30.960 --> 13:32.759
Hey, what's your middle name?!

13:32.760 --> 13:33.729
- Sue!

13:33.730 --> 13:34.563
Why?!

13:35.670 --> 13:36.983
- Want to write you a poem!

13:37.938 --> 13:38.771
- Okay!

14:02.880 --> 14:04.759
- Don't slow down right
before the finish line!

14:04.760 --> 14:06.049
Come on!

14:06.050 --> 14:09.043
Come on, come on, come on,
come on, come on, come on!

14:09.044 --> 14:11.627
(Jody panting)

14:14.403 --> 14:15.235
(Jody sighs)

14:15.236 --> 14:17.079
Hydrate. Sip, don't guzzle.

14:17.080 --> 14:17.913
- How did I do?

14:20.160 --> 14:20.993
- Not bad.

14:22.290 --> 14:25.099
Enough that you wouldn't be
a complete waste of my time.

14:25.100 --> 14:26.123
- Gee, thanks.

14:27.250 --> 14:28.950
- So what's your school situation?

14:30.310 --> 14:31.973
- I just started summer vacation.

14:33.830 --> 14:34.833
- Any job prospects?

14:36.260 --> 14:38.159
- I babysit my little
brothers on the weekdays,

14:38.160 --> 14:39.560
and my dad pays me for that.

14:40.430 --> 14:41.509
- Do you think he'd have any flexibility

14:41.510 --> 14:42.960
in giving you the summer off?

14:43.870 --> 14:44.702
- Sheesh.

14:44.703 --> 14:47.023
I mean, probably not.

14:48.760 --> 14:50.359
Why? Why'd you ask?

14:50.360 --> 14:53.299
- Here's the deal, this
spring, I was training a runner

14:53.300 --> 14:54.449
for this fall's Pinnacle Games,

14:54.450 --> 14:57.929
and that fell through and it
left me without an athlete.

14:57.930 --> 14:59.429
So I was planning to sit this year out,

14:59.430 --> 15:02.033
but if you're interested,

15:02.900 --> 15:04.969
I'd be willing to put you in that spot.

15:04.970 --> 15:05.929
It wouldn't be easy.

15:05.930 --> 15:08.139
Three months is not a
lot of time to train,

15:08.140 --> 15:11.159
but it's doable if we're disciplined.

15:11.160 --> 15:13.473
- So we could go to the Pinnacle Games?

15:14.310 --> 15:16.809
- That's the beauty of
them, they're all amateur.

15:16.810 --> 15:18.469
And if you do well there,

15:18.470 --> 15:20.079
it opens up all kinds of possibilities,

15:20.080 --> 15:24.259
not the Olympics, but paid
competitions, for sure.

15:24.260 --> 15:26.919
- And you think I'm good enough for that?

15:26.920 --> 15:28.770
- To be bluntly honest, probably not.

15:29.740 --> 15:31.379
Chances are, your body will crap out,

15:31.380 --> 15:32.669
or you won't be able to handle the pain

15:32.670 --> 15:34.729
and stress of training,
or a million other things,

15:34.730 --> 15:38.767
but most of it's gonna come down to you.

15:40.027 --> 15:41.449
Are you willing to sacrifice

15:41.450 --> 15:42.819
and be miserable in the short-term

15:42.820 --> 15:46.741
for something potentially
really great long-term?

15:46.742 --> 15:49.909
(gentle guitar music)

15:52.120 --> 15:53.659
- [Bill] The Pinnacle Games?

15:53.660 --> 15:54.810
- That's what she said.

15:55.790 --> 15:58.149
- She thinks you have a
legitimate chance at that?

15:58.150 --> 15:59.300
- That's what she said.

16:01.350 --> 16:04.739
- And this isn't some kinda
weird sex thing with this woman?

16:04.740 --> 16:06.763
- So far, no.

16:09.410 --> 16:11.569
- I don't know, sounds fishy.

16:11.570 --> 16:13.209
I mean, she just pulls up out of nowhere

16:13.210 --> 16:14.579
and offers all this up?

16:14.580 --> 16:16.089
- No, no, no, she'd seen me run before,

16:16.090 --> 16:19.130
and then she had me do, like,
a 5,000-meter for her, so...

16:20.490 --> 16:22.063
She thinks I have potential.

16:24.750 --> 16:26.200
- Who's gonna watch the boys?

16:31.080 --> 16:32.490
- I dunno.
- "I dunno."

16:33.960 --> 16:35.789
How is this running thing
gonna be any different

16:35.790 --> 16:37.819
than the guitar lessons
or the French lessons

16:37.820 --> 16:39.529
or anything else you started all gung-ho,

16:39.530 --> 16:41.362
and then quit after two weeks?

16:41.363 --> 16:42.195
- I dunno.

16:42.196 --> 16:44.389
- Stop telling me what you don't know.

16:44.390 --> 16:45.469
Start telling me something

16:45.470 --> 16:47.879
that you do know, please.
- Well, I don't know anything!

16:47.880 --> 16:49.709
So maybe I just need
to keep quitting things

16:49.710 --> 16:52.609
until I find the one thing
that I don't want to quit.

16:52.610 --> 16:53.499
- There.

16:53.500 --> 16:55.009
Thank you. That's a good answer.

16:55.010 --> 16:56.210
Was that so hard?
- No.

16:57.130 --> 16:57.963
- Great.

17:00.493 --> 17:02.729
All right, we'll give
this running thing a shot.

17:02.730 --> 17:04.429
I'll find somebody else to watch the boys.

17:04.430 --> 17:05.579
- Thank you!

17:05.580 --> 17:07.649
Okay, I really appreciate it.

17:07.650 --> 17:09.759
I'm gonna go give her a call.

17:09.760 --> 17:11.499
- But I want the coach's name, please.

17:11.500 --> 17:12.489
Phone number, address,

17:12.490 --> 17:13.489
email, anything else.
- Yeah.

17:13.490 --> 17:15.043
Yeah, okay. Yeah.

17:25.042 --> 17:28.280
(crickets chirping)

17:28.281 --> 17:31.031
(birds chirping)

17:49.170 --> 17:50.569
- Hey, ready to get started?

17:50.570 --> 17:51.719
- Big time!

17:51.720 --> 17:52.869
- All right.

17:52.870 --> 17:55.209
We are gonna do two miles at 50% speed,

17:55.210 --> 17:58.309
two miles at 75%, and
then two miles all out.

17:58.310 --> 17:59.469
After that, we'll see where we are

17:59.470 --> 18:01.539
and figure out what to do next.

18:01.540 --> 18:02.483
- Okay, let's do it.

18:06.000 --> 18:07.279
- The road is yours.

18:07.280 --> 18:08.949
- Oh. So I just go.

18:08.950 --> 18:10.600
- Yeah. I'll be right behind you.

18:11.872 --> 18:13.489
- Wait, wait, wait!

18:13.490 --> 18:15.269
We should do something to celebrate,

18:15.270 --> 18:17.853
like a toast, but not a toast.

18:18.750 --> 18:19.829
- Yeah, we're not gonna do that.

18:19.830 --> 18:21.399
- Oh, come on, come on. Please?

18:21.400 --> 18:24.993
Just something to
appreciate this opportunity.

18:25.960 --> 18:27.105
- Okay, what? Come on, quick.

18:27.106 --> 18:28.316
- Okay.

18:28.317 --> 18:29.150
Slap my hand.

18:30.920 --> 18:33.081
(hand slaps)
Now stick yours out.

18:33.082 --> 18:34.432
(hand slaps)
Now hip bump!

18:35.430 --> 18:37.108
- Yeah, there's no way in
holy hell that's gonna happen.

18:37.109 --> 18:38.713
- Come on, crabby patty!

18:40.983 --> 18:42.741
(Hannah sighs)

18:42.742 --> 18:43.889
Wow!

18:43.890 --> 18:45.161
- Are you happy now?

18:45.162 --> 18:46.569
- Ecstatic.

18:46.570 --> 18:47.409
- Can we get going?

18:47.410 --> 18:49.709
- Yeah, I don't know why
you're holding things up

18:49.710 --> 18:52.619
with these gimme fives
and these hip bumps.

18:52.620 --> 18:54.719
Be more professional.

18:54.720 --> 18:56.819
- Oh, my God, it's gonna
be a long Goddamn day.

18:56.820 --> 18:57.653
- Woo-hoo!

19:14.890 --> 19:16.340
- [Hannah] Widen your stride.

19:18.456 --> 19:20.729
- [Jody] That doesn't feel comfortable.

19:20.730 --> 19:21.846
- [Hannah] It will once
you get used to it,

19:21.847 --> 19:23.733
and it'll be easier on your hips.

19:26.338 --> 19:29.169
- [Jody] Is the bullhorn really necessary?

19:29.170 --> 19:31.366
- [Hannah] Yes, the
bullhorn is the word of God

19:31.367 --> 19:33.593
and shall be obeyed without question.

19:34.930 --> 19:35.763
- [Jody] Lame.

19:36.810 --> 19:37.839
- [Hannah] I heard that, you just earned

19:37.840 --> 19:39.203
yourself an extra mile.

19:40.040 --> 19:43.153
The word of God shall be obeyed
without question or comment.

20:18.140 --> 20:18.973
Break.

20:30.320 --> 20:31.783
Hydrate. Sip, don't guzzle.

20:36.790 --> 20:38.590
- Can I ask you a personal question?

20:40.440 --> 20:41.363
- Guess so.

20:42.370 --> 20:44.063
- Did you ever run track yourself?

20:45.010 --> 20:45.973
- Hell yes.

20:46.930 --> 20:48.733
I lived, slept, and ate running.

20:49.710 --> 20:51.063
- Did you ever win anything?

20:52.600 --> 20:53.433
- Nope.

20:57.890 --> 20:58.723
- What happened?

20:59.880 --> 21:01.383
- No one, big, tragic event.

21:02.618 --> 21:05.533
Just a lot of years of
good, but not good enough.

21:07.450 --> 21:09.623
I had the heart, but not the knees.

21:15.950 --> 21:16.783
Lunch.

21:19.590 --> 21:21.399
- What, I don't get my sandwich?

21:21.400 --> 21:24.303
- No, you get lukewarm
chicken and cold brown rice.

21:25.740 --> 21:27.803
- Do I get a fork?

21:27.804 --> 21:28.637
- Oh.

21:31.730 --> 21:33.403
Get in touch with your inner animal.

21:41.781 --> 21:43.199
- Mm.

21:43.200 --> 21:44.033
So good.

21:46.997 --> 21:48.383
- You are incredibly odd.

21:49.489 --> 21:50.322
- So good.

21:53.867 --> 21:56.097
(Jody mimics howling)

21:56.098 --> 21:56.931
So tasty.

22:31.200 --> 22:33.109
- [Hannah] You know where
the Quabbin Trail is?

22:33.110 --> 22:34.439
- Yeah.
- We'll meet there tomorrow

22:34.440 --> 22:35.273
at 7:00 a.m.

22:36.360 --> 22:38.999
In the meantime, I've
written out a diet plan

22:39.000 --> 22:40.459
I want you to get on.

22:40.460 --> 22:41.699
It's pretty simple.

22:41.700 --> 22:43.469
Egg whites or oatmeal for breakfast.

22:43.470 --> 22:44.659
No processed carbs.

22:44.660 --> 22:46.589
That includes bread and fast food.

22:46.590 --> 22:49.969
And, you know, it's mostly
veggies and brown rice.

22:49.970 --> 22:51.229
And no beer, if you have the habit

22:51.230 --> 22:52.730
of sneaking a few of those in.

22:53.706 --> 22:54.539
- Okay.

22:55.530 --> 22:59.969
- Now, if you cheat on this,
I won't know right away,

22:59.970 --> 23:02.459
but I will know eventually and
then there'll be hell to pay,

23:02.460 --> 23:04.683
so do us both a favor and don't cheat.

23:05.570 --> 23:08.159
We have a small number of
months to get you in shape.

23:08.160 --> 23:10.643
- What are you talking
about? I'm in great shape.

23:11.710 --> 23:14.299
- You're in great shape for a civilian.

23:14.300 --> 23:16.350
I need you in great shape for an athlete.

23:21.330 --> 23:22.163
- Hey, Coach?

23:23.780 --> 23:25.169
- Yeah?

23:25.170 --> 23:26.579
- Did I do all right today?

23:26.580 --> 23:29.229
- Look, I'll tell you
when you do really well,

23:29.230 --> 23:30.899
and I'll tell you when you do really bad,

23:30.900 --> 23:32.919
but what I won't do is hold your hand

23:32.920 --> 23:34.269
and give you a pat on the back for getting

23:34.270 --> 23:35.720
through a basic training day.

23:36.600 --> 23:37.870
Got it?

23:37.871 --> 23:38.704
- Got it.

23:39.810 --> 23:40.923
- Tomorrow at seven.

23:43.012 --> 23:45.595
(engine whirs)

24:14.150 --> 24:16.729
- Mr. Worm, you have been found guilty

24:16.730 --> 24:19.359
of being a covert agent of Al-Qaeda.

24:19.360 --> 24:22.033
The punishment is death by bike tire.

24:23.610 --> 24:24.623
Put him down, Davey.

24:27.296 --> 24:28.519
- Ew.

24:28.520 --> 24:30.927
God, you guys are such little psychos.

24:30.928 --> 24:32.837
- F you, Jody Sue!

24:32.838 --> 24:34.957
- F you, Jody Sue!
- Yeah, that's really mature.

24:34.958 --> 24:35.790
Really mature.

24:35.791 --> 24:37.098
Hey, guess what, guess what, guess what?

24:37.099 --> 24:38.299
You're gonna keep it up?

24:38.300 --> 24:41.189
I'm gonna sell you to the
pedophile down the street!

24:41.190 --> 24:43.504
Yeah, run away, little nerds!

24:43.505 --> 24:44.748
- Dad!
- What?!

24:44.749 --> 24:46.825
- Jody said she was gonna
sell us to a pedophile.

24:46.826 --> 24:48.869
- Yeah, what's a pedophile?
- I don't have the patience

24:48.870 --> 24:49.879
to do this right now, guys.

24:49.880 --> 24:51.021
Go play your Xbox.

24:51.022 --> 24:52.869
- [Both] Xbox!

24:52.870 --> 24:54.233
- You too. Get inside.

25:01.750 --> 25:03.309
What the hell's the matter with you?

25:03.310 --> 25:04.529
- What?!

25:04.530 --> 25:06.999
They're out there killing worms!

25:07.000 --> 25:09.679
That doesn't bother you?
That's like serial killer shit!

25:09.680 --> 25:11.649
- No, it's not. It's little boy shit.

25:11.650 --> 25:13.469
And watch your mouth, you're
getting way too comfortable

25:13.470 --> 25:15.053
with your swearing around here.

25:16.010 --> 25:16.899
- Sorry.

25:16.900 --> 25:18.639
- Yeah, you're always sorry.

25:18.640 --> 25:20.259
If you're not gonna help
out and make things better,

25:20.260 --> 25:23.359
the least you can do is
not make it more difficult.

25:23.360 --> 25:24.193
Shit!

25:32.110 --> 25:33.859
- Hey, guys.

25:33.860 --> 25:35.299
- [Davey] You made Dad mad.

25:35.300 --> 25:36.963
- Wet toilet paper ball!

25:36.964 --> 25:38.136
(paper ball splats)
- Ew!

25:38.137 --> 25:40.852
Oh, my God, I can't take it anymore!

25:40.853 --> 25:42.129
(Donny chuckles)

25:42.130 --> 25:43.009
Hey.

25:43.010 --> 25:45.010
Hey, do you still want to meet up today?

25:46.020 --> 25:48.870
Cool. Can you meet me at the
A.C.P. in, like, 20 minutes?

25:50.350 --> 25:51.183
Okay.

25:52.200 --> 25:53.033
Okay, bye.

26:01.170 --> 26:03.063
- [Tim] So, what made you call me?

26:05.230 --> 26:09.083
- I was having a good day
and that became a bad day,

26:09.084 --> 26:10.934
and I just wanted someone to talk to.

26:12.620 --> 26:15.339
What made you chase after me earlier?

26:15.340 --> 26:17.333
- Just caught up in the moment.

26:20.580 --> 26:22.580
I wanted to ask you out all school year.

26:25.080 --> 26:26.614
- Really?

26:26.615 --> 26:28.405
What?! Why didn't you?

26:28.406 --> 26:30.519
- Because we were in the same class.

26:30.520 --> 26:32.719
If you said no, it would have
been 20 weeks of awkwardness.

26:32.720 --> 26:34.609
Yesterday, it was like, if she says no,

26:34.610 --> 26:36.319
she's got the whole summer
to forget about me making

26:36.320 --> 26:38.080
an ass out of myself, so...

26:39.720 --> 26:41.809
- Well, you should have asked me sooner.

26:41.810 --> 26:42.710
- Now you tell me.

26:48.230 --> 26:52.293
- So did you write me that poem
you said you were going to?

26:55.500 --> 26:58.519
- Yes, but I was hoping to sneak it to you

26:58.520 --> 27:00.139
as you were leaving so
you could read it at home

27:00.140 --> 27:01.136
and I wouldn't have to see your face.

27:01.137 --> 27:02.099
- No.

27:02.100 --> 27:03.948
No, not a chance, so give it to me.

27:03.949 --> 27:04.781
(Tim sighs)

27:04.782 --> 27:09.115
Give it to me, come on.
- Okay, all right, all right.

27:13.230 --> 27:15.589
See, what I did was
write the name Jody Sue

27:15.590 --> 27:17.529
down the side of the page,
then used every letter

27:17.530 --> 27:19.923
of your name to start a new sentence.

27:20.980 --> 27:21.812
- [Jody] Okay, so read it all out to me.

27:21.813 --> 27:23.299
- [Tim] What? No, no way.

27:23.300 --> 27:25.169
- [Jody] Mm-hm, if you're gonna go 50%

27:25.170 --> 27:27.559
of the way to write it, then
you have to go the extra 100

27:27.560 --> 27:29.309
to read it out loud.
- Ugh.

27:29.310 --> 27:30.709
- Hey.

27:30.710 --> 27:33.297
I would never make fun of you.

27:37.915 --> 27:38.748
- Okay.

27:39.586 --> 27:42.169
(gentle music)

27:49.456 --> 27:51.789
(Tim sighs)

27:54.560 --> 27:58.573
J: Just when I thought it
was gonna be a lonely summer.

28:00.350 --> 28:03.653
O: Out of the sunlight she ran.

28:05.890 --> 28:09.937
D: Dream-like, vision-like.

28:12.620 --> 28:16.653
Y: Yesterday doesn't matter,

28:17.730 --> 28:20.619
only today and tomorrow with her.

28:20.620 --> 28:24.299
S: Sensual.

28:24.300 --> 28:26.189
Her stride, her essence.

28:26.190 --> 28:27.224
Sensual.

28:27.225 --> 28:28.939
(Jody chuckles)

28:28.940 --> 28:31.277
- Nobody's ever called sensual before.

28:32.660 --> 28:33.810
- Well, get used to it.

28:36.440 --> 28:40.513
U: Under her spell, that's where I am.

28:42.730 --> 28:46.253
E: Every day,

28:47.620 --> 28:50.693
every minute, every second,

28:53.520 --> 28:55.470
I want to be with her as much as I can.

29:01.124 --> 29:01.957
- Wow.

29:04.221 --> 29:05.638
- Do you like it?

29:17.821 --> 29:18.970
(Judy chuckles)

29:18.971 --> 29:21.090
- Was that good?

29:21.091 --> 29:23.459
- Yeah.
(Judy chuckles)

29:23.460 --> 29:24.960
Let's do it again.

29:40.142 --> 29:45.142
(crickets chirping)
(birds chirping)

29:57.200 --> 29:58.919
- How those legs feeling?

29:58.920 --> 30:01.089
- Sore, but good.

30:01.090 --> 30:03.983
- Well, strap in 'cause it's
about to get a whole lot worse.

30:04.980 --> 30:07.309
These stairs used to
kick my ass in my prime.

30:07.310 --> 30:08.799
Now, it's your turn.

30:08.800 --> 30:11.149
Go up, come down, go up again.

30:11.150 --> 30:12.439
Over and over.

30:12.440 --> 30:13.729
- How many times?

30:13.730 --> 30:15.304
- Till I say stop.

30:15.305 --> 30:16.539
(Jody clicking tongue)

30:16.540 --> 30:18.003
- [Jody] You're the coach, Coach.

30:21.640 --> 30:23.293
- Faster! Show some hustle.

30:29.383 --> 30:30.954
- That wasn't so hard.

30:30.955 --> 30:32.839
- Yeah, that's what I said my first time.

30:32.840 --> 30:34.640
Let's see if you can keep saying it.

30:44.700 --> 30:46.250
I'm gonna go make a phone call.

30:49.000 --> 30:50.159
But sound travels out here,

30:50.160 --> 30:52.129
so don't think you can
get away with slacking.

30:52.130 --> 30:54.843
I want to hear the constant
rhythm of footsteps.

30:57.270 --> 30:59.469
Hi, I'm calling to find
out if it would be possible

30:59.470 --> 31:00.920
to get my credit line raised?

31:03.790 --> 31:06.233
Yeah, and how much would be possible?

31:09.350 --> 31:11.823
Okay, and what interest
rate would that be at?

31:13.861 --> 31:16.444
(Hannah sighs)

31:19.800 --> 31:22.956
Okay, yeah, let's go ahead and do that.

31:22.957 --> 31:24.607
And when would that be available?

31:27.560 --> 31:28.393
Okay.

31:29.320 --> 31:30.153
Thanks.

31:32.000 --> 31:34.059
(cellphone beeps)

31:34.060 --> 31:35.110
Something the matter?

31:36.760 --> 31:37.719
- Just pacing myself.

31:37.720 --> 31:39.470
- Yeah, well, pace yourself faster.

31:52.550 --> 31:53.503
Come on.

31:55.310 --> 31:56.443
Get back up.

31:59.356 --> 32:00.556
(Jody groans)

32:00.557 --> 32:02.038
- Shit!

32:02.039 --> 32:02.872
- Good.

32:13.141 --> 32:13.974
Not bad.

32:15.524 --> 32:18.274
(birds chirping)

32:22.756 --> 32:25.423
(soft knocking)

32:36.260 --> 32:37.463
Yeah?
- Hi.

32:38.300 --> 32:40.050
I'm Bill Brightwell, Jody's father.

32:40.890 --> 32:41.889
- Oh.

32:41.890 --> 32:42.739
Hi.

32:42.740 --> 32:43.573
Come on in.

32:54.530 --> 32:55.763
Come on in. Have a seat.

32:57.960 --> 32:59.099
Can I get you something to drink?

32:59.100 --> 33:00.019
- No thanks.

33:00.020 --> 33:01.909
I just figured since you
guys were gonna be spending

33:01.910 --> 33:04.169
so much time together,
we should probably meet.

33:04.170 --> 33:06.143
- I completely understand.

33:08.200 --> 33:10.473
Did you have any specific questions?

33:11.460 --> 33:13.609
- No, I just wanted to get a general idea

33:13.610 --> 33:15.760
as to how you thought
things were gonna go.

33:16.840 --> 33:18.699
I've been doing some reading
on these Pinnacle Games,

33:18.700 --> 33:21.159
seems like they're a pretty
big deal if you win, huh?

33:21.160 --> 33:24.067
- They're a big deal
even if you don't win.

33:24.068 --> 33:26.233
- And you think Jody's
good enough to compete?

33:27.440 --> 33:28.789
- Hard to say.

33:28.790 --> 33:30.149
She's good.

33:30.150 --> 33:32.159
It's a little too early
to know if she's great.

33:32.160 --> 33:34.206
- Yeah, course my biggest
concern is her getting

33:34.207 --> 33:36.373
her hopes up and then being disappointed.

33:37.300 --> 33:39.549
- Well, I have told her
exactly what I just told you.

33:39.550 --> 33:41.709
I haven't sugarcoated anything.

33:41.710 --> 33:43.549
- Good. Good.

33:43.550 --> 33:45.563
Keep her hopeful, but realistic.

33:46.930 --> 33:50.339
And even though I know you're
getting something out of this,

33:50.340 --> 33:52.173
I do appreciate you taking her on.

33:53.090 --> 33:54.649
God knows it's been a long time

33:54.650 --> 33:57.033
since she had a female
role model worth a damn.

33:58.820 --> 33:59.653
- Glad to do it.

34:01.310 --> 34:05.419
- Word of warning though,
she does get frazzled easily,

34:05.420 --> 34:07.339
and sometimes, she quits things

34:07.340 --> 34:09.009
before she gives them a chance.

34:09.010 --> 34:12.319
- Well, I haven't seen
any of that in her yet,

34:12.320 --> 34:14.469
but I'll keep an eye out for it.

34:14.470 --> 34:16.669
- Good. I mean, I'm not
trying to insult her.

34:16.670 --> 34:18.829
I would love for her to
find her true passion.

34:18.830 --> 34:22.829
It's just that I assume
you're putting a good chunk

34:22.830 --> 34:24.579
of your own money into this training.

34:24.580 --> 34:26.639
- Yeah, a fair amount.

34:26.640 --> 34:27.473
- Yeah.

34:28.780 --> 34:30.809
So before, like I said, I was concerned

34:30.810 --> 34:33.699
about her getting her hopes
up and being disappointed,

34:33.700 --> 34:35.359
there is a flip side to that,

34:35.360 --> 34:38.129
I'm also concerned about
her getting your hopes up

34:38.130 --> 34:39.679
and you being disappointed.

34:39.680 --> 34:42.483
- I have been down that road before,

34:43.520 --> 34:48.139
but, like I said, I'm not
seeing any of that in Jody.

34:48.140 --> 34:49.579
At least, not yet.

34:49.580 --> 34:51.233
- I'm glad. I worry about her.

34:53.290 --> 34:58.290
- Well, maybe instead of
look at her for what she is,

34:58.740 --> 34:59.909
it'll be better if you looked at her

34:59.910 --> 35:01.510
for what she's capable of being.

35:03.700 --> 35:05.919
- That is a good strategy,

35:05.920 --> 35:08.489
but, just to put it out there,

35:08.490 --> 35:11.289
if you need help with money
for the training, let me know.

35:11.290 --> 35:13.349
I mean, I can't do much,
but it doesn't seem right

35:13.350 --> 35:15.650
for you to be carrying
the whole load on this.

35:16.810 --> 35:21.343
- Actually, yeah, that would be great.

35:22.720 --> 35:25.229
I wish I could be more proud
and say I didn't need it, but-

35:25.230 --> 35:27.859
- Hey, fuck pride, okay?

35:27.860 --> 35:29.329
You don't mind me swearing, do you?

35:29.330 --> 35:31.439
- Knock your fucking self out.

35:31.440 --> 35:32.273
- Good.

35:33.210 --> 35:35.019
Pride is destructive.

35:35.020 --> 35:36.849
There's nothing wrong
with asking for help,

35:36.850 --> 35:37.999
and there's certainly nothing wrong

35:38.000 --> 35:39.800
with accepting it when it's offered.

35:42.860 --> 35:44.010
- Have a drink with me.

35:49.330 --> 35:51.209
All I've got is cheap, white wine.

35:51.210 --> 35:52.729
That okay?

35:52.730 --> 35:53.563
- Sounds good.

35:55.200 --> 35:57.619
- Sorry about the cups.

35:57.620 --> 36:00.429
I live a pretty Spartan lifestyle.

36:00.430 --> 36:02.530
- Hey, reminds me of my old bachelor days.

36:03.983 --> 36:05.383
- Do you think I'm pathetic?

36:06.240 --> 36:08.837
- No. Why would I think that?

36:11.304 --> 36:13.039
- I don't know.

36:13.040 --> 36:15.409
I have no idea how I appear to adults.

36:15.410 --> 36:18.819
Every minute of my life is
spent with teenage girls.

36:18.820 --> 36:22.269
- Trust me, I don't look very
good to outsiders either.

36:22.270 --> 36:25.539
Let me put it this way, Jody's
mother is no longer with us,

36:25.540 --> 36:27.323
and it's not because she's dead.

36:29.530 --> 36:31.419
- That a good story there?

36:31.420 --> 36:32.419
- Nope.

36:32.420 --> 36:34.499
Just met someone else, moved to Florida.

36:34.500 --> 36:35.333
The end.

36:37.070 --> 36:39.569
- Well, maybe she'll get
eaten by an alligator.

36:39.570 --> 36:40.570
- Only if I'm lucky.

36:42.570 --> 36:45.679
Are you at least happy
doing what you're doing?

36:45.680 --> 36:49.079
- You know, I have a lot of flaws,

36:49.080 --> 36:51.330
but lack of self-awareness
isn't one of them.

36:52.680 --> 36:56.259
I know I'm too old to be
asking people for money,

36:56.260 --> 36:58.739
and I'm definitely too old
to be chasing after dreams

36:58.740 --> 37:00.690
I should have given up a long time ago.

37:02.140 --> 37:04.363
I should have quit a long
time ago, but I didn't.

37:05.697 --> 37:08.440
You ask me if I'm happy, the answer's no,

37:11.000 --> 37:15.129
but I think I could be
if I can even accomplish

37:15.130 --> 37:17.463
a little of what I set
out to 20 years ago.

37:20.930 --> 37:22.007
Shit. Sorry.

37:23.390 --> 37:25.196
Real great first impression, huh?

37:25.197 --> 37:26.469
"Nice to meet you, Mr. Brightwell.

37:26.470 --> 37:30.248
Let me vomit a metric ton of
personal baggage all over you."

37:30.249 --> 37:31.081
- Hey, it's all right.

37:31.082 --> 37:33.069
What you're doing is important.

37:33.070 --> 37:35.589
We need dreamers to inspire our children

37:35.590 --> 37:37.479
and to remind us adults
that there is more to life

37:37.480 --> 37:39.869
than just punching a time clock

37:39.870 --> 37:41.470
and getting through the workday.

37:43.630 --> 37:46.529
- Well, thanks.

37:46.530 --> 37:47.479
- Yeah.

37:47.480 --> 37:49.159
Just keep doing what you're doing.

37:49.160 --> 37:49.993
Cheers.

37:50.968 --> 37:54.051
(gentle piano music)

38:02.502 --> 38:03.769
- Do you think I should get that

38:03.770 --> 38:05.599
tramp stamp tattooed back there?

38:05.600 --> 38:07.942
- You bite your blasphemous tongue!

38:07.943 --> 38:09.319
(Jody chuckles)
You shouldn't do anything

38:09.320 --> 38:10.803
to alter this beautiful skin.

38:10.804 --> 38:11.739
- Mm.

38:11.740 --> 38:13.899
- All right, you're Xs, I'm Os.

38:13.900 --> 38:14.733
You go first.

38:16.940 --> 38:17.773
- Center square.

38:20.536 --> 38:21.489
I feel like this isn't fair though

38:21.490 --> 38:22.779
'cause I can't see the game board.

38:22.780 --> 38:24.730
- I guess you'll just have to trust me.

38:28.059 --> 38:28.892
Mm.

38:30.550 --> 38:31.700
I'm upper right corner.

38:34.290 --> 38:35.123
- Lower right.

38:38.012 --> 38:40.059
- So what do you like most about running?

38:40.060 --> 38:40.893
I'm upper left.

38:44.454 --> 38:47.133
- I don't really like anything about it.

38:47.134 --> 38:48.734
It hurts and it makes you stink.

38:50.854 --> 38:51.687
- But...

38:53.600 --> 38:58.600
- But sometimes, after
a long-distance run,

39:00.690 --> 39:04.229
the pain, I mean, it
doesn't really go away,

39:04.230 --> 39:05.799
but it just becomes something different,

39:05.800 --> 39:06.800
a little more fuzzy,

39:07.990 --> 39:09.689
and then your thoughts start to fade

39:09.690 --> 39:14.099
and just kinda becomes easier
to forget all the bad stuff,

39:14.100 --> 39:17.563
so I like that part.

39:21.170 --> 39:22.003
Oh. Lower left.

39:25.185 --> 39:28.518
- What bad things do you want to forget?

39:29.436 --> 39:31.436
- Everything in my life.

39:33.768 --> 39:35.101
Until I met you.

39:42.020 --> 39:47.020
- Thanks, but I think I
have some bad news for you.

39:50.781 --> 39:51.613
I win.

39:51.614 --> 39:53.559
(Tim laughs)
(Jody groans)

39:53.560 --> 39:54.393
- Bummer!

39:55.771 --> 39:58.164
So what do you want for your prize?

39:58.165 --> 39:59.415
- I don't know.

40:03.943 --> 40:06.062
I think I just want to
kiss the game board.

40:06.063 --> 40:06.895
(Jody chuckles)

40:06.896 --> 40:09.647
(Tim chuckles)

40:09.648 --> 40:12.087
(Jody chuckles)

40:12.088 --> 40:13.324
(Jody laughs)

40:13.325 --> 40:14.648
(Tim grunts)

40:14.649 --> 40:17.482
(water splashing)

40:22.170 --> 40:23.002
- Oh, shit!

40:23.003 --> 40:23.835
Oh, shit!

40:23.836 --> 40:26.389
(Jody yelping)

40:26.390 --> 40:28.140
- All the way in, up to your waist.

40:29.481 --> 40:31.069
- Oh, my God.

40:31.070 --> 40:31.939
Oh, my God.

40:31.940 --> 40:33.559
Okay, what now, what now, what now?

40:33.560 --> 40:35.573
- Run, knees up, like you're sprinting.

40:37.815 --> 40:38.849
- Woo!

40:38.850 --> 40:39.811
Oh, my God!

40:39.812 --> 40:42.399
If I had balls, they
would be in my throat.

40:42.400 --> 40:45.050
- Well, it's a good thing
you don't have balls, then.

40:47.002 --> 40:51.079
- Are there any, like,
snapping turtles in here?

40:51.080 --> 40:53.143
- No, the sharks ate them all.

40:54.200 --> 40:55.653
- Was that a joke?

40:56.670 --> 41:00.103
Do women after menopause
still have a sense of humor?

41:00.104 --> 41:01.663
I just didn't know that.

41:01.664 --> 41:02.496
Woo!

41:02.497 --> 41:04.137
- Hey, I have not been through menopause.

41:05.296 --> 41:07.379
(Jody laughs)

41:07.380 --> 41:09.689
Ha ha ha, hilarious.

41:09.690 --> 41:10.639
Mouth shut, knees up.

41:10.640 --> 41:12.212
Less talk, more run.

41:12.213 --> 41:14.796
(Jody squeals)

41:17.090 --> 41:18.074
(Jody squeals)

41:18.075 --> 41:20.658
(gentle music)

41:57.459 --> 41:58.365
- Ta-da.

41:58.366 --> 41:59.472
- Whoa!
- I've always wanted to do

41:59.473 --> 42:00.629
something dramatic and say "ta-da."

42:00.630 --> 42:02.962
- Where did you get that?
- My brother gave it to me.

42:02.963 --> 42:04.869
He said it unlocks the mental cage

42:04.870 --> 42:06.270
where the creativity's kept.

42:07.540 --> 42:09.109
- I mean, I've never done it before.

42:09.110 --> 42:10.229
Have you?
- No.

42:10.230 --> 42:11.062
But I think we need to start living

42:11.063 --> 42:12.320
a little more dangerously.

42:15.775 --> 42:16.607
- I'm just still in training, so-

42:16.608 --> 42:18.499
- Come on. Discipline is for the day.

42:18.500 --> 42:20.399
Afternoon and night is for rock and roll

42:20.400 --> 42:22.503
and shaking the pillars
of Heaven Almighty.

42:23.640 --> 42:26.293
- Okay, okay, okay, okay,
okay, but you got to go first.

42:32.240 --> 42:33.072
Yeah?

42:33.073 --> 42:34.033
Yeah? Is that good?

42:35.500 --> 42:36.350
- It's wonderful.

42:36.351 --> 42:37.849
(Jody laughs)
(Tim coughing)

42:37.850 --> 42:38.949
Your turn, Giggles McGee.

42:38.950 --> 42:40.533
- Okay, okay.

42:42.560 --> 42:43.718
Oh, my God, that smells

42:43.719 --> 42:45.019
like rubbing alcohol.
- Do it.

42:45.020 --> 42:45.853
- Okay.

42:52.100 --> 42:52.933
Oh, my God!

42:53.870 --> 42:56.079
Oh, my God, that is so repugnant.

42:56.080 --> 42:57.249
- My brother warned me about this.

42:57.250 --> 42:58.899
He said the bad taste was
the price we had to pay

42:58.900 --> 43:00.269
to get to the visions on the other side.

43:00.270 --> 43:02.270
- Did you bring anything to mix it with?

43:03.764 --> 43:07.009
(Jody chuckles)

43:07.010 --> 43:08.429
- I figured it would cooler
if we pounded it straight

43:08.430 --> 43:09.499
like Charles Bukowski.

43:09.500 --> 43:11.139
- Who's Charles Bukowski?

43:11.140 --> 43:12.409
- I think the trick is just to get it down

43:12.410 --> 43:13.242
as fast as we can.

43:13.243 --> 43:14.359
We'll alternate gulps back and forth.

43:14.360 --> 43:15.192
- Okay, okay.

43:15.193 --> 43:16.830
Okay, but we're gonna hydrate,

43:16.831 --> 43:18.393
we're gonna sip, and no guzzle.

43:20.249 --> 43:21.119
- That's not what we want.

43:21.120 --> 43:22.694
We need to guzzle.

43:22.695 --> 43:23.739
(Tim chuckles)

43:23.740 --> 43:26.063
- No.
(Jody coughs)

43:28.377 --> 43:29.294
Okay, okay.

43:31.636 --> 43:34.446
(Tim coughing)

43:34.447 --> 43:35.480
(Jody sighs)

43:35.481 --> 43:36.314
Hoo!

43:40.282 --> 43:41.555
Okay, okay.

43:41.556 --> 43:44.004
(Jody sighs)

43:44.005 --> 43:46.402
(Tim coughs)

43:46.403 --> 43:49.639
Woo! Woo!
(Tim coughing)

43:49.640 --> 43:50.733
I love the woods.

43:52.070 --> 43:55.133
My mom really liked the
woods too, but, you know,

43:56.130 --> 44:01.123
she's not really, like, around anymore.

44:03.586 --> 44:04.929
(Jody laughs)

44:04.930 --> 44:05.929
I don't want to think about that,

44:05.930 --> 44:09.059
so here's a question

44:09.060 --> 44:11.410
that my little brother
asked me this past week:

44:12.410 --> 44:14.639
Who do you think would win in a fight,

44:14.640 --> 44:17.763
a T-Rex or a great white shark?

44:19.490 --> 44:22.889
They're both big and they're both vicious,

44:22.890 --> 44:27.890
but one's a land animal and
one's, like, a water animal,

44:28.410 --> 44:30.079
so the location of the fight is,

44:30.080 --> 44:31.169
like, what's most important.

44:31.170 --> 44:34.409
And I see it taking place
on, like, a shoreline.

44:34.410 --> 44:38.889
And if that's so, then which
beast is better at dragging

44:38.890 --> 44:43.890
the other one into their domain?

44:43.970 --> 44:47.739
'Cause the T. Rex has
those tiny little arms,

44:47.740 --> 44:50.940
and the great white has, like,
those massive fins, so...

44:52.130 --> 44:57.130
Thereby, I think it would
be easier for the dinosaur

44:59.800 --> 45:03.399
to grab hold of said
fins and drag him on land

45:03.400 --> 45:07.665
where he lay him down
for a proper beating.

45:07.666 --> 45:10.166
(Jody laughs)

45:15.150 --> 45:15.983
Timothy.

45:17.470 --> 45:18.853
Contribute to the debate.

45:21.530 --> 45:22.363
Timothy.

45:24.310 --> 45:25.519
Timothy!

45:25.520 --> 45:26.857
Contribute to the debate!

45:39.721 --> 45:42.388
(Jody chuckles)

45:51.411 --> 45:52.478
(loud tapping)

45:52.479 --> 45:53.312
- Come on!

46:28.495 --> 46:29.328
You okay?

46:31.419 --> 46:32.886
(Jody sighs)

46:32.887 --> 46:34.109
Are you hungover?

46:34.110 --> 46:34.943
- No.

46:38.170 --> 46:40.370
'Cause I think I'm still
a little bit drunk.

46:41.240 --> 46:42.575
- Oh!

46:42.576 --> 46:45.383
I don't Goddamn believe this!

46:46.285 --> 46:47.469
- I'm sorry, Coach.

46:47.470 --> 46:49.529
- You can shove your "sorry."

46:49.530 --> 46:51.049
This may not mean anything to you,

46:51.050 --> 46:52.683
but it means everything to me.

46:53.660 --> 46:55.149
You take your ass home and you think about

46:55.150 --> 46:56.769
what you really want to get out of this,

46:56.770 --> 46:58.209
because if you're gonna half-ass it,

46:58.210 --> 47:00.209
I'm gonna throw you right
back on the trash heap

47:00.210 --> 47:01.961
where I found you!

47:01.962 --> 47:04.342
(door clacks)

47:04.343 --> 47:06.760
(door thuds)

47:08.865 --> 47:09.963
- What?!

47:09.964 --> 47:10.797
Come on!

47:14.820 --> 47:15.653
Fuck.

47:16.601 --> 47:19.184
(Jody panting)

47:56.651 --> 47:59.039
(Hannah sighs)

47:59.040 --> 48:00.539
- I can do most of it by myself,

48:00.540 --> 48:03.069
I can do 99% of it by myself,

48:03.070 --> 48:05.363
but I just can't do all of it by myself.

48:07.270 --> 48:09.363
A little help, please.

48:25.345 --> 48:28.012
(soft knocking)

48:34.770 --> 48:35.603
What?

48:36.530 --> 48:37.929
- I ran all the way here so it wouldn't be

48:37.930 --> 48:39.180
a total waste of the day.

48:43.690 --> 48:44.523
- Sit.

48:45.880 --> 48:47.453
Hydrate. Sip, don't guzzle.

48:56.530 --> 48:57.680
So why'd you come here?

49:00.120 --> 49:01.813
- I wanted to say that I'm sorry.

49:03.360 --> 49:04.259
- You already said that.

49:04.260 --> 49:09.260
- I know, but I'm not just
saying it, I'm feeling it,

49:09.290 --> 49:11.609
'cause I've been doing this training

49:11.610 --> 49:13.269
and I've been seeing this guy,

49:13.270 --> 49:15.759
and I'm trying to give my all to both,

49:15.760 --> 49:16.959
but I don't want to let him down,

49:16.960 --> 49:18.349
and I don't want to let you down,

49:18.350 --> 49:19.919
and I can't think straight

49:19.920 --> 49:22.619
and I can't do anything right and I suck!

49:22.620 --> 49:24.819
I suck harder than
anyone who's ever sucked

49:24.820 --> 49:26.463
in the history of suckdom.

49:29.530 --> 49:31.230
- Well, that was quite a mouthful.

49:32.700 --> 49:36.213
- Yeah, it's just been piling up, I guess.

49:38.940 --> 49:39.853
- What's his name?

49:41.810 --> 49:43.259
- Tim.

49:43.260 --> 49:45.010
- And how long you been seeing him?

49:45.960 --> 49:47.393
- Since we started training.

49:49.756 --> 49:52.263
- That's been a pretty
impressive juggling act, then.

49:54.240 --> 49:57.406
Thing is, training's only
gonna get tougher from here,

49:57.407 --> 49:59.229
and I'm not sure you're ready for that.

49:59.230 --> 50:00.719
- I am.

50:00.720 --> 50:03.336
I wouldn't fuck up again.

50:03.337 --> 50:04.479
And if I did, I would quit,

50:04.480 --> 50:08.313
or you could punch me in the
stomach as hard as you want.

50:09.520 --> 50:12.253
- Well, how could I pass up
an opportunity like that?

50:14.750 --> 50:17.089
All right, put out your pinkie.

50:17.090 --> 50:18.940
- What?
- The ultimate pinkie swear.

50:20.040 --> 50:23.099
From now on, you will do
what I say, when I say,

50:23.100 --> 50:25.269
and you will follow my regimen exactly,

50:25.270 --> 50:27.173
even when I'm not around to watch you.

50:28.520 --> 50:30.093
Swear.
- I promise.

50:31.560 --> 50:32.393
- All right.

50:33.780 --> 50:36.833
Tomorrow morning, 6:00 a.m.,
in front of your house.

50:38.080 --> 50:38.913
- Thank you.

50:39.850 --> 50:41.069
- Yeah, don't thank me yet.

50:41.070 --> 50:42.620
The hard stuff's still to come.

50:43.570 --> 50:44.933
Go home, get rested.

50:46.007 --> 50:46.840
- Okay.

50:56.275 --> 50:59.025
(dramatic music)

52:54.112 --> 52:56.489
(Laurene laughs)

52:56.490 --> 52:57.733
- [Laurene] Well, shit.

52:59.560 --> 53:00.809
Hannah Goddamn Dalton.

53:00.810 --> 53:02.909
- Laurene. How are you?

53:02.910 --> 53:04.289
- I'm good.

53:04.290 --> 53:06.239
What brings you back to
the old stomping grounds?

53:06.240 --> 53:07.489
- I got a new runner.

53:07.490 --> 53:08.699
She's been pretty decent in training.

53:08.700 --> 53:09.569
I want to see how she holds up

53:09.570 --> 53:11.209
under the pressure of competition.

53:11.210 --> 53:12.289
- You thought of me.

53:12.290 --> 53:13.123
- I did.

53:14.270 --> 53:16.659
You're the best long-distance
runner in the area.

53:16.660 --> 53:19.369
- I was the best long-distance
runner in the area.

53:19.370 --> 53:20.699
I'm more mom than athlete now.

53:20.700 --> 53:21.789
I just...

53:21.790 --> 53:23.729
I come here to keep
rust off the old joints.

53:23.730 --> 53:25.580
- You're good enough for what I need.

53:27.260 --> 53:28.360
- What's in it for me?

53:29.250 --> 53:31.239
- Thrill of matching up
against a worthy competitor?

53:31.240 --> 53:33.440
- Stopped caring about
that a long time ago.

53:35.670 --> 53:37.170
- Hundred bucks to the winner.

53:39.880 --> 53:40.713
- Make it two.

53:42.870 --> 53:45.039
- I'm not in the greatest
spot financially right now.

53:45.040 --> 53:46.940
- Neither am I. That's why I need two.

53:49.740 --> 53:50.849
- Fine.

53:50.850 --> 53:51.939
- 5,000-meter?

53:51.940 --> 53:53.259
- Yup.

53:53.260 --> 53:54.269
Stone Church Road.

53:54.270 --> 53:56.249
Tomorrow at eight.
- Done.

53:56.250 --> 53:57.359
- Hey.

53:57.360 --> 53:59.439
Don't you want to know
anything about my girl?

53:59.440 --> 54:00.809
- Nah. Not necessary.

54:00.810 --> 54:01.810
- [Hannah] How come?

54:03.510 --> 54:04.963
- Forget it.
- Humor me.

54:06.460 --> 54:08.219
- If you have to know,
I'm not that worried.

54:08.220 --> 54:09.709
Your judgment's not been the best lately.

54:09.710 --> 54:11.209
No offense.

54:11.210 --> 54:12.809
- Oh, why would I be offended by that?

54:12.810 --> 54:13.642
- Oh, come on.

54:13.643 --> 54:14.909
Hannah, what happened to your last girl?

54:14.910 --> 54:17.709
Didn't she have, like, a
nervous breakdown or some shit?

54:17.710 --> 54:19.308
- She couldn't handle the training.

54:19.309 --> 54:21.123
- Ever think it was you
she couldn't handle?

54:22.526 --> 54:23.699
- Tomorrow at eight.

54:23.700 --> 54:24.533
Bring cash.

54:25.550 --> 54:26.550
- Right back at you.

55:17.365 --> 55:20.379
- Okay, now, she's a great runner,

55:20.380 --> 55:22.199
but she can't pace herself for shit.

55:22.200 --> 55:24.809
So what you're gonna do
is you're gonna hold back

55:24.810 --> 55:26.649
to about 75% most of the way.

55:26.650 --> 55:27.929
Just let her wear herself out.

55:27.930 --> 55:29.729
Okay, when you see that red barn,

55:29.730 --> 55:31.429
that's when you drop the hammer.

55:31.430 --> 55:33.749
You go all out, a hundred percent.

55:33.750 --> 55:35.073
Got it?

55:35.074 --> 55:37.209
- And you think I'm ready for this?

55:37.210 --> 55:39.759
- I wouldn't have set it up if I didn't.

55:39.760 --> 55:42.579
And not to throw you off,

55:42.580 --> 55:44.837
but our financial future's gonna take

55:44.838 --> 55:46.769
a bit of a hit if you lose.

55:46.770 --> 55:47.970
And by ours I mean mine.

55:48.930 --> 55:49.762
- You bet money on me?

55:49.763 --> 55:51.189
- Yeah, I did.

55:51.190 --> 55:53.093
- Oh, my God.

55:54.070 --> 55:55.469
- If you can't handle the pressure now,

55:55.470 --> 55:58.263
how are you gonna handle the
pressure at the Pinnacle Games?

55:59.215 --> 56:00.694
- Yeah.

56:00.695 --> 56:01.612
Okay, yeah.

56:07.670 --> 56:08.839
- What's this?

56:08.840 --> 56:09.759
- A piece of paper.

56:09.760 --> 56:10.769
- Nope.

56:10.770 --> 56:12.313
It is a blank white page.

56:13.540 --> 56:14.719
Whenever you get overwhelmed,

56:14.720 --> 56:16.319
that's all I want you to think about.

56:16.320 --> 56:20.299
Keep this in your head,
a blank white page.

56:20.300 --> 56:21.133
Got it?

56:22.270 --> 56:23.103
- That's stupid.

56:24.350 --> 56:25.182
What are you doing?

56:25.183 --> 56:26.883
What the hell?
- What do you see?

56:27.910 --> 56:29.189
- Your hand.

56:29.190 --> 56:30.893
- In your mind, what do you see?

56:32.950 --> 56:34.999
- Fuck it, blank white page.

56:35.000 --> 56:37.379
- Again.
- Blank white page.

56:37.380 --> 56:38.419
- Good.

56:38.420 --> 56:40.253
A blank white page.

56:41.490 --> 56:42.539
All right, you ready?

56:42.540 --> 56:43.372
- Yeah.

56:43.373 --> 56:44.206
- Good. Let's go.

56:50.180 --> 56:52.775
- Jody.
- Any problem over there?

56:52.776 --> 56:54.193
- No, no problem.

56:55.067 --> 56:57.734
(serious music)

57:25.364 --> 57:27.864
- All right, toes on the line.

57:40.026 --> 57:40.859
Get set!

57:46.180 --> 57:47.245
(gun fires)

57:47.246 --> 57:50.329
(intense drum music)

58:16.737 --> 58:19.570
(thrilling music)

58:59.976 --> 59:03.226
- [Laurene] See you at the finish line.

59:32.660 --> 59:34.649
- Come on.

59:34.650 --> 59:35.482
Come on.

59:35.483 --> 59:36.852
Don't get cocky. Don't slow down.

59:36.853 --> 59:38.879
You got her if you just hold steady.

59:38.880 --> 59:42.397
(Hannah applauds)
Come on!

59:42.398 --> 59:44.148
Come on! You're home!

59:45.600 --> 59:48.178
- I'll catch up with you later, Coach!

59:48.179 --> 59:49.011
- Woo!

59:49.012 --> 59:51.845
(Laurene panting)

59:55.587 --> 59:56.549
- Where the hell did you find her?

59:56.550 --> 59:58.789
- Just running down the side of the road.

59:58.790 --> 1:00:00.309
- Well, shit.

1:00:00.310 --> 1:00:03.635
If you ever get sick of her, let me know.

1:00:03.636 --> 1:00:04.836
I'll take her on myself.

1:00:07.190 --> 1:00:08.333
- Cash?

1:00:08.334 --> 1:00:13.334
- Oh, right.

1:00:14.432 --> 1:00:17.179
- Oh, God.
- Sorry about the sweat.

1:00:17.180 --> 1:00:18.679
- It's disgusting.

1:00:18.680 --> 1:00:20.450
- They'll spend fine once they dry out.

1:00:20.451 --> 1:00:21.284
- Ugh.

1:00:23.231 --> 1:00:24.064
Ugh.

1:00:36.720 --> 1:00:39.379
Oh, I got to admit, I liked
that cross the finish line

1:00:39.380 --> 1:00:41.330
and keep on running thing.
- Oh, yeah.

1:00:42.402 --> 1:00:43.539
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1:00:43.540 --> 1:00:44.963
- Showed style and charisma.

1:00:46.071 --> 1:00:47.449
(Jody laughs)
Hey, that can be as important

1:00:47.450 --> 1:00:49.759
to future sponsors and
advertisers as actually winning.

1:00:49.760 --> 1:00:52.636
Oh, speaking of which...

1:00:52.637 --> 1:00:53.783
Ugh.

1:00:53.784 --> 1:00:55.383
Ugh.

1:00:55.384 --> 1:00:56.673
- What is this?!

1:00:57.530 --> 1:00:59.329
- Hundred bucks. Half the winnings.

1:00:59.330 --> 1:01:01.003
Whatever we make, we split 50/50.

1:01:02.300 --> 1:01:03.132
- Thank you.

1:01:03.133 --> 1:01:03.965
- Yeah, remember that when you sign

1:01:03.966 --> 1:01:05.419
your first million-dollar
endorsement deal.

1:01:05.420 --> 1:01:08.099
- Mm-hm, we'll see.
- And whatever you do,

1:01:08.100 --> 1:01:09.333
don't smell that money.

1:01:15.280 --> 1:01:17.029
- Oh, my God!

1:01:17.030 --> 1:01:18.059
Oh, my God.
- What did I just

1:01:18.060 --> 1:01:18.892
tell you not to do?

1:01:18.893 --> 1:01:20.539
- Smell the money.
- And what did you do?

1:01:20.540 --> 1:01:21.653
- Smelled the money.

1:01:22.530 --> 1:01:26.393
It smells like onions and jockstraps.

1:01:28.040 --> 1:01:29.139
Smell the money!
- No!

1:01:29.140 --> 1:01:32.609
Seriously, I do not have the
gag reflex for shit like that.

1:01:32.610 --> 1:01:34.399
- How have you been an athlete this long

1:01:34.400 --> 1:01:36.429
with such a low gross out tolerance?

1:01:36.430 --> 1:01:37.889
- It hasn't been easy.

1:01:37.890 --> 1:01:40.109
That hygiene shit is the worst part.

1:01:40.110 --> 1:01:43.129
Like, you go into the
locker room after a workout,

1:01:43.130 --> 1:01:45.179
and you got your soap and your towel,

1:01:45.180 --> 1:01:47.109
and you set that soap down in the shower,

1:01:47.110 --> 1:01:50.279
and every time, without fail,
when you pick up that soap,

1:01:50.280 --> 1:01:51.869
even if it's just for a second,

1:01:51.870 --> 1:01:55.829
there will be a spare pubic
hair on that soap, every time.

1:01:55.830 --> 1:01:56.749
Like, how do pubic hairs even get

1:01:56.750 --> 1:01:58.300
in the soap tray, I don't know.

1:01:59.800 --> 1:02:02.880
- I think I need

1:02:03.950 --> 1:02:05.148
you to smell the money!
- No.

1:02:05.149 --> 1:02:06.086
- Just a little bit!
- Keep that shit away from me!

1:02:06.087 --> 1:02:07.424
- Smell the money!
- No, no!

1:02:07.425 --> 1:02:08.264
No!
- Guess what?!

1:02:08.265 --> 1:02:09.097
Smell it!
- No!

1:02:09.098 --> 1:02:10.015
Smell the money!
- No!

1:02:10.016 --> 1:02:11.104
- Come on!
- No!

1:02:11.105 --> 1:02:14.105
(Jody squealing)
No!

1:02:15.265 --> 1:02:17.004
- Boom, baby!

1:02:17.005 --> 1:02:17.989
- What is this?

1:02:17.990 --> 1:02:20.769
- Oh, that's just some prize money

1:02:20.770 --> 1:02:24.499
because Coach set up a
race for me, and I won!

1:02:24.500 --> 1:02:25.600
- No shit?
- No shit!

1:02:26.690 --> 1:02:28.469
I'm sorry, no kidding.

1:02:28.470 --> 1:02:29.956
- Wow, that's great.

1:02:29.957 --> 1:02:31.316
You should be proud of yourself.

1:02:31.317 --> 1:02:32.200
What are you gonna do with it?

1:02:32.201 --> 1:02:33.836
- I'm gonna give it to you.

1:02:33.837 --> 1:02:34.919
I mean, I know it's not that much,

1:02:34.920 --> 1:02:36.509
but I thought it might help a little bit

1:02:36.510 --> 1:02:38.541
with the daycare for the trolls.

1:02:38.542 --> 1:02:39.409
- No, no.

1:02:39.410 --> 1:02:41.409
Hey, you won this fair and square.

1:02:41.410 --> 1:02:42.399
You do what you want with it.

1:02:42.400 --> 1:02:44.078
- I am doing what I want with it.

1:02:44.079 --> 1:02:45.979
I'm giving it to you.

1:02:45.980 --> 1:02:46.929
- You're positive?

1:02:46.930 --> 1:02:47.930
- Positive positive.

1:02:48.810 --> 1:02:50.379
- All right, great. Hey, thank you.

1:02:50.380 --> 1:02:51.869
- Yeah.

1:02:51.870 --> 1:02:53.949
Where are the little trolls, anyway?

1:02:53.950 --> 1:02:56.083
- They're out back, playing
with their nunchucks.

1:02:56.084 --> 1:02:58.099
- Mm, good place for them.

1:02:58.100 --> 1:02:59.219
- Hey.

1:02:59.220 --> 1:03:00.479
I am really proud of you for the way

1:03:00.480 --> 1:03:02.039
you've stuck with this running.

1:03:02.040 --> 1:03:03.680
And I'm proud of you
for giving me this too.

1:03:03.681 --> 1:03:05.429
- Thanks.

1:03:05.430 --> 1:03:06.869
Don't be so weird about it.

1:03:06.870 --> 1:03:08.059
- I said I am proud of you.

1:03:08.060 --> 1:03:09.513
- Don't be weird!

1:03:12.500 --> 1:03:17.500
(crickets chirping)
(birds chirping)

1:03:26.411 --> 1:03:27.244
Hey.

1:03:29.444 --> 1:03:31.099
What's this?

1:03:31.100 --> 1:03:32.799
- Pinnacle Games confirmation sheet.

1:03:32.800 --> 1:03:34.093
I entered us. We're in.

1:03:37.292 --> 1:03:39.679
- Okay, so this isn't just talk anymore.

1:03:39.680 --> 1:03:41.149
We're really doing this.

1:03:41.150 --> 1:03:41.983
- We are.

1:03:43.873 --> 1:03:46.171
- We're going to the Pinnacle Games.

1:03:46.172 --> 1:03:47.749
- What did I just say?

1:03:47.750 --> 1:03:50.509
- And you think I'm good enough for this?

1:03:50.510 --> 1:03:51.699
- Don't get cocky, all right?

1:03:51.700 --> 1:03:53.112
We still have a month of training to go.

1:03:53.113 --> 1:03:54.309
- Come on, please.

1:03:54.310 --> 1:03:58.233
Coach Tough Love, do you think
I'm good enough for this?

1:03:59.570 --> 1:04:01.689
- I think you will be good enough.

1:04:01.690 --> 1:04:02.522
- Okay, close enough.

1:04:02.523 --> 1:04:04.009
- Okay, so we're hugging.
- Mm.

1:04:04.010 --> 1:04:04.960
- All right.
- Mm.

1:04:06.250 --> 1:04:07.163
Oh, my gosh.

1:04:09.550 --> 1:04:10.609
I'm gonna get this framed.

1:04:10.610 --> 1:04:11.989
I'm gonna hang it on my wall.

1:04:11.990 --> 1:04:13.189
- Yeah, let's not get carried away.

1:04:13.190 --> 1:04:17.029
♪ Mm, this is the perfect
time to get carried away ♪

1:04:17.030 --> 1:04:18.689

Get up, get up, get up.

1:04:19.733 --> 1:04:21.289
You got to train me into a sleek,

1:04:21.290 --> 1:04:22.940
fierce, lightning bolt from hell.

Oh, my God.

- Jesus Christ.

1:04:51.479 --> 1:04:54.396
(triumphant music)

1:05:57.420 --> 1:06:00.420
(crickets chirping)

1:06:08.371 --> 1:06:11.038
(Jody coughing)

1:06:18.468 --> 1:06:19.545
- [Tim] What is it?

1:06:19.546 --> 1:06:20.378
Are you just nervous

1:06:20.379 --> 1:06:22.299
for the Games tomorrow?
- No.

1:06:22.300 --> 1:06:24.429
Last week, I was nervous.

1:06:24.430 --> 1:06:26.989
Today, I'm just fucking terrified.

1:06:26.990 --> 1:06:29.029
Like, I just...

1:06:29.030 --> 1:06:31.479
I can't do this.

1:06:31.480 --> 1:06:34.509
I'm not ready, I'm not
ready for the Games, so...

1:06:34.510 --> 1:06:36.289
- Didn't you just win
that race a few weeks ago?

1:06:36.290 --> 1:06:38.729
- Yeah, but that was against one person.

1:06:38.730 --> 1:06:41.409
The Games are against multiple athletes,

1:06:41.410 --> 1:06:43.053
the best in the country.

1:06:44.720 --> 1:06:48.333
My God, in front of, like,
hundreds of people, so...

1:06:49.290 --> 1:06:51.490
There's no way that I
don't choke, you know?

1:06:53.450 --> 1:06:55.629
- I wish I knew what to say.

1:06:55.630 --> 1:06:56.462
- There's nothing you can say.

1:06:56.463 --> 1:06:57.880
I mean, I'm just...

1:07:00.437 --> 1:07:02.523
I'm not ready, not ready for the Games.

1:07:04.760 --> 1:07:06.689
This isn't just jitters, you know?

1:07:06.690 --> 1:07:08.749
Like, I've been thinking about
it and thinking about it.

1:07:08.750 --> 1:07:12.329
Like, I'm not ready.

1:07:12.330 --> 1:07:13.163
Can't do it.

1:07:14.010 --> 1:07:15.210
- Well, I think you are,

1:07:17.300 --> 1:07:19.170
but if you're sure you don't want to...

1:07:21.786 --> 1:07:24.119
Well, if we both got up
really early tomorrow,

1:07:24.120 --> 1:07:25.759
I could snag my mom's
car, you could sneak out.

1:07:25.760 --> 1:07:27.809
Maybe we could just go on a road trip,

1:07:27.810 --> 1:07:29.049
up the Maine coast or something.

1:07:29.050 --> 1:07:31.800
Just hide the whole weekend
till everything blows over.

1:07:37.039 --> 1:07:39.449
- You would do that for me?

1:07:39.450 --> 1:07:40.283
- Course.

1:07:42.570 --> 1:07:43.770
I'd do anything for you.

1:07:45.766 --> 1:07:48.849
(gentle piano music)

1:07:52.269 --> 1:07:53.629
- I don't know. I just don't know.

1:07:56.490 --> 1:07:58.140
I'm just not ready for the Games.

1:07:59.880 --> 1:08:01.703
- What are you gonna say to your coach?

1:08:03.397 --> 1:08:05.679
- God, I don't know.

1:08:05.680 --> 1:08:09.460
I can't say anything face to
face, that's 100%, like...

1:08:11.420 --> 1:08:15.127
I guess I'll just call her
when we're on the road, but...

1:08:17.280 --> 1:08:20.629
She's gonna be so Goddamn
disappointed in me,

1:08:20.630 --> 1:08:22.849
which shouldn't even surprise her

1:08:22.850 --> 1:08:27.319
because nothing I do is
ever good enough for her.

1:08:27.320 --> 1:08:28.873
Or for my dad, for that matter.

1:08:32.460 --> 1:08:36.517
The only person I don't
feel that way about is you.

1:08:44.867 --> 1:08:45.893
- I'm glad.

1:08:48.170 --> 1:08:50.370
- I'd kiss you if I
didn't have puke breath.

1:08:53.030 --> 1:08:54.500
- Hey, I don't mind.

1:08:56.409 --> 1:08:57.506
Ugh, ew!
- Stop!

1:08:57.507 --> 1:09:00.384
- Sour puke taste.
- Stop, that's not funny!

1:09:00.385 --> 1:09:01.218
Stop.

1:09:06.940 --> 1:09:08.253
I seriously love you.

1:09:12.643 --> 1:09:14.237
- I seriously love you too.

1:09:40.033 --> 1:09:45.033
(crickets chirping)
(birds chirping)

1:09:51.410 --> 1:09:53.469
- Hi, it's me, again.

1:09:53.470 --> 1:09:56.219
You need to call me and let
me know what's going on.

1:09:56.220 --> 1:09:57.370
We're losing time here.

1:10:03.180 --> 1:10:05.763
(Hannah sighs)

1:10:10.580 --> 1:10:13.163
(engine whirs)

1:10:21.221 --> 1:10:22.229
(soft knocking)

1:10:22.230 --> 1:10:23.199
- [Bill] Hi.

1:10:23.200 --> 1:10:24.429
- Hi. Is Jody here?

1:10:24.430 --> 1:10:25.539
- I thought she was with you.

1:10:25.540 --> 1:10:27.499
I figured you'd be halfway
to the Games by now.

1:10:27.500 --> 1:10:29.150
- We should be. She never showed.

1:10:31.450 --> 1:10:32.283
- Come on in.

1:10:36.760 --> 1:10:37.829
- If I had to guess,

1:10:37.830 --> 1:10:40.099
she's probably with that
boy she's been seeing.

1:10:40.100 --> 1:10:42.173
- What boy she's been seeing?

1:10:44.150 --> 1:10:45.819
- All I know is his first name is Tim,

1:10:45.820 --> 1:10:47.670
and she's been seeing him all summer.

1:10:49.570 --> 1:10:52.709
Sorry, I didn't know you didn't know.

1:10:52.710 --> 1:10:54.963
- All right, I'll start calling around.

1:10:55.900 --> 1:10:58.899
Holy Christ, I don't
even know where to begin.

1:10:58.900 --> 1:11:00.743
Yes, I do. At least, I think I do.

1:11:01.610 --> 1:11:02.523
Goddammit!

1:11:04.060 --> 1:11:04.892
- All right, I'm gonna check out

1:11:04.893 --> 1:11:06.199
some of our old training spots.

1:11:06.200 --> 1:11:09.369
It's a long shot, but it's
better than doing nothing.

1:11:09.370 --> 1:11:10.949
- [Bill] Hey, if you hear anything,

1:11:10.950 --> 1:11:12.769
please, just let me know, all right?

1:11:12.770 --> 1:11:13.609
Anything.

1:11:13.610 --> 1:11:14.443
- I will.

1:11:16.330 --> 1:11:17.163
Hey.

1:11:19.310 --> 1:11:20.510
It's gonna be all right.

1:11:22.136 --> 1:11:24.719
(Hannah sighs)

1:11:28.703 --> 1:11:31.620
(stream splashing)

1:11:38.296 --> 1:11:40.713
(tone rings)

1:11:41.775 --> 1:11:44.004
(cellphone rings)

1:11:44.005 --> 1:11:45.309
(cellphone beeps)

1:11:45.310 --> 1:11:46.710
Hang on. I got to pull over.

1:11:59.000 --> 1:11:59.900
Are you all right?

1:12:01.160 --> 1:12:01.993
- Yeah.

1:12:04.580 --> 1:12:06.159
- Where are you?

1:12:06.160 --> 1:12:07.043
- I'm with Tim.

1:12:08.070 --> 1:12:10.519
In New Hampshire, near the coast.

1:12:10.520 --> 1:12:13.739
- What? What the hell are
you doing in New Hampshire?

1:12:13.740 --> 1:12:16.339
- I had a bit of a meltdown.

1:12:16.340 --> 1:12:18.640
It was the worst kinda
sick I ever felt, so...

1:12:19.750 --> 1:12:20.900
I just had to get away.

1:12:22.180 --> 1:12:23.013
- Okay.

1:12:24.200 --> 1:12:25.349
I need you need to get back in his car

1:12:25.350 --> 1:12:27.700
and get your ass back
here as fast as possible.

1:12:29.090 --> 1:12:32.519
We're gonna be late, but
maybe they'll take pity on us.

1:12:32.520 --> 1:12:33.929
- I could tell you that I'm coming,

1:12:33.930 --> 1:12:37.430
but that would be a lie, so...

1:12:38.320 --> 1:12:41.079
I've calmed down, but I'm
still sure of my decision.

1:12:41.080 --> 1:12:42.799
I'm not ready for the Games.

1:12:42.800 --> 1:12:44.729
- Okay, no, no, no.

1:12:44.730 --> 1:12:48.769
You're giving into fear, and
I know you're gonna regret it.

1:12:48.770 --> 1:12:50.819
I know you think you have
an ocean of opportunities

1:12:50.820 --> 1:12:52.919
ahead of you, but you don't.

1:12:52.920 --> 1:12:55.920
These opportunities are so rare,
and you've trained so hard.

1:12:56.840 --> 1:13:01.593
- Yeah, so maybe we could
try again next summer?

1:13:04.230 --> 1:13:06.080
- There's not gonna be a next summer.

1:13:07.670 --> 1:13:08.770
This was my last shot.

1:13:10.133 --> 1:13:12.133
- I'm sorry, Coach. I know I'm a coward.

1:13:15.440 --> 1:13:16.273
- So that's it?

1:13:19.410 --> 1:13:20.243
- Yeah.

1:13:24.010 --> 1:13:25.223
- Do me one favor?

1:13:26.860 --> 1:13:27.693
- Sure.

1:13:28.550 --> 1:13:29.659
- Call your dad.

1:13:29.660 --> 1:13:30.740
He's worried.

1:13:32.466 --> 1:13:33.298
(cellphone beeps)

1:13:33.299 --> 1:13:36.382
(lively piano music)

1:13:42.015 --> 1:13:44.432
(Jody sighs)

1:14:00.563 --> 1:14:03.230
(Hannah grunts)

1:14:06.432 --> 1:14:09.182
(dramatic music)

1:15:49.576 --> 1:15:50.802
- You okay?

1:15:50.803 --> 1:15:51.636
Come here.

1:15:53.878 --> 1:15:56.416
(keys clacking)

1:15:56.417 --> 1:15:58.814
(snaps fingers)

1:15:58.815 --> 1:16:00.315
Go wait for me in the kitchen.

1:16:07.340 --> 1:16:08.173
Step out.

1:16:18.380 --> 1:16:22.463
Do you got anything you
want to say for yourself?

1:16:23.610 --> 1:16:24.803
- Not really.

1:16:26.210 --> 1:16:27.169
She was scared, she didn't think

1:16:27.170 --> 1:16:28.859
she could talk to you or her coach,

1:16:28.860 --> 1:16:31.269
and she needed help, so that's what I did.

1:16:31.270 --> 1:16:32.489
So I'm sorry about the
feelings that got hurt,

1:16:32.490 --> 1:16:35.493
but I'd do it again if I had to.

1:16:37.550 --> 1:16:39.669
- Well, you did the wrong thing,

1:16:39.670 --> 1:16:41.720
but I guess it was for the right reasons.

1:16:42.730 --> 1:16:43.979
You're Tim, right?

1:16:43.980 --> 1:16:44.813
- Yeah.

1:16:46.140 --> 1:16:47.686
- I appreciate you looking out for her,

1:16:47.687 --> 1:16:49.629
but if something like
this ever happens again,

1:16:49.630 --> 1:16:52.029
you and I are gonna have a
real problem, you understand?

1:16:52.030 --> 1:16:53.399
- Yes, sir.

1:16:53.400 --> 1:16:54.910
- All right. Go on home.

1:17:06.826 --> 1:17:09.159
(Tim sighs)

1:17:11.145 --> 1:17:13.728
(engine whirs)

1:17:23.411 --> 1:17:25.500
Do I have to say anything?

1:17:25.501 --> 1:17:26.334
- No.

1:17:27.240 --> 1:17:28.699
- You know how much you hurt your coach?

1:17:28.700 --> 1:17:29.699
- Yes.

1:17:29.700 --> 1:17:30.649
- And you're gonna go over there

1:17:30.650 --> 1:17:31.899
and you're gonna apologize to her,

1:17:31.900 --> 1:17:32.749
face to face.
- Yes.

1:17:32.750 --> 1:17:34.089
Yes, I'll go over later.

1:17:34.090 --> 1:17:34.923
- No.

1:17:36.870 --> 1:17:38.319
- I'll go over now?

1:17:38.320 --> 1:17:39.223
- Yes.

1:17:40.100 --> 1:17:42.523
And this Tim guy, is that serious?

1:17:43.870 --> 1:17:45.535
- Yeah.

1:17:45.536 --> 1:17:46.589
(Bill sighs)

1:17:46.590 --> 1:17:48.129
- All right, I don't what your mother

1:17:48.130 --> 1:17:49.569
and you used to talk about,

1:17:49.570 --> 1:17:51.999
but did you two have the sex talk?

1:17:52.000 --> 1:17:53.909
- Oh, my God, Dad!

1:17:53.910 --> 1:17:55.869
The only thing that could make

1:17:55.870 --> 1:17:59.359
this day worse is you trying
to have the sex talk with me.

1:17:59.360 --> 1:18:01.479
- We're not gonna do it now, okay?

1:18:01.480 --> 1:18:03.109
But we're gonna do it.

1:18:03.110 --> 1:18:04.289
We'll get through it one time.

1:18:04.290 --> 1:18:06.659
It'll suck for you, it's
gonna definitely suck for me,

1:18:06.660 --> 1:18:07.869
but we'll do it one time

1:18:07.870 --> 1:18:09.649
and then we'll never have to
talk about it again, okay?

1:18:09.650 --> 1:18:10.729
- Okay.

1:18:10.730 --> 1:18:12.609
- Okay?
- Okay!

1:18:12.610 --> 1:18:13.733
- Okay. Good.

1:18:14.580 --> 1:18:15.433
Now, go.

1:18:19.591 --> 1:18:22.638
(door clacks)

1:18:22.639 --> 1:18:24.179
(door thuds)

1:18:24.180 --> 1:18:29.180
(crickets chirping)
(birds chirping)

1:18:47.063 --> 1:18:49.480
(Jody sighs)

1:18:52.797 --> 1:18:55.464
(soft knocking)

1:18:58.554 --> 1:19:01.054
(door clacks)

1:19:06.200 --> 1:19:07.300
- [Hannah] Come on in.

1:19:20.160 --> 1:19:21.193
How was your trip?

1:19:22.250 --> 1:19:23.309
- Terrible.

1:19:23.310 --> 1:19:24.143
- Good.

1:19:28.423 --> 1:19:32.519
- You know I didn't do it for fun, right?

1:19:32.520 --> 1:19:33.353
- I know.

1:19:34.490 --> 1:19:37.409
- You ever freezed up
before meet like I did?

1:19:37.410 --> 1:19:39.773
- Yeah, but I fought through it,

1:19:40.820 --> 1:19:43.212
which is why I wish you
had just talked to me

1:19:43.213 --> 1:19:44.709
instead of just taking off.

1:19:44.710 --> 1:19:46.659
I could have talked you through it.

1:19:46.660 --> 1:19:48.329
Didn't I do that for you
when you raced Laurene?

1:19:48.330 --> 1:19:50.999
- Yeah, but it was just so overwhelming

1:19:51.000 --> 1:19:53.213
that I didn't want to
be talked through it.

1:19:58.470 --> 1:19:59.303
Do you hate me?

1:20:00.360 --> 1:20:01.916
- No, I don't hate you.

1:20:01.917 --> 1:20:03.959
- Are you disappointed in me?

1:20:03.960 --> 1:20:05.199
- Absolutely, I am.

1:20:05.200 --> 1:20:06.879
And I'm not gonna do anything

1:20:06.880 --> 1:20:08.883
to try to make you feel better about that.

1:20:12.080 --> 1:20:13.497
- I deserve that.

1:20:17.880 --> 1:20:20.520
I just hope you can find a
way to forgive me because

1:20:23.930 --> 1:20:28.749
I really respect you and
you're my best friend

1:20:28.750 --> 1:20:30.443
and I really love you a lot.

1:20:34.661 --> 1:20:36.859
(Hannah scoffs)

1:20:36.860 --> 1:20:38.119
What?

1:20:38.120 --> 1:20:40.749
- Nothing, it's just been a long time

1:20:40.750 --> 1:20:42.552
somebody's said anything like that to me.

1:20:42.553 --> 1:20:45.636
(gentle piano music)

1:20:53.490 --> 1:20:54.419
Hey, remember that pinkie swear

1:20:54.420 --> 1:20:55.870
you made a couple months ago?

1:20:58.121 --> 1:20:59.122
- Yeah.

1:20:59.123 --> 1:20:59.955
Why?

1:20:59.956 --> 1:21:02.327
- 'Cause I still owe you
a punch in the stomach.

1:21:28.620 --> 1:21:30.149
Take a good look.

1:21:30.150 --> 1:21:32.169
This is where the Games are held.

1:21:32.170 --> 1:21:35.199
- [Jody] It's a lot bigger
than I thought it was gonna be.

1:21:35.200 --> 1:21:37.050
- Yep. That's why I brought you here.

1:21:38.440 --> 1:21:39.529
This is what the future holds,

1:21:39.530 --> 1:21:40.939
so if you're gonna get overwhelmed,

1:21:40.940 --> 1:21:42.940
do it now and get it out of your system.

1:21:44.448 --> 1:21:47.248
- So does that mean you're
gonna train me for next year?

1:21:48.140 --> 1:21:49.340
- I'm thinking about it.

1:21:50.455 --> 1:21:52.309
I'm not big on giving
people second chances,

1:21:52.310 --> 1:21:55.949
but that attitude hasn't
gotten me very far, so...

1:21:55.950 --> 1:21:58.339
- I know you have no reason to believe me,

1:21:58.340 --> 1:22:00.040
but I wouldn't let you down again.

1:22:02.900 --> 1:22:04.339
- Two conditions.

1:22:04.340 --> 1:22:07.039
One, the day may come when we
look at your little freeze-up

1:22:07.040 --> 1:22:08.679
and laugh about it, but I'm not there yet,

1:22:08.680 --> 1:22:11.209
so for now, we don't talk about it,

1:22:11.210 --> 1:22:12.089
we don't joke about it.

1:22:12.090 --> 1:22:13.529
We shove it to the back of our brains

1:22:13.530 --> 1:22:14.829
and we pretend like it never happened,

1:22:14.830 --> 1:22:17.143
like two normal, dysfunctional Americans.

1:22:18.300 --> 1:22:20.789
Two, the day before the Games,

1:22:20.790 --> 1:22:22.839
you are not out of my
sight for one second.

1:22:22.840 --> 1:22:24.559
You stay at my house,
you sleep on my floor,

1:22:24.560 --> 1:22:25.699
and if you have to go to the bathroom,

1:22:25.700 --> 1:22:27.289
you do it with the door open.

1:22:27.290 --> 1:22:28.799
Got it?
- Ew.

1:22:28.800 --> 1:22:29.889
- [Hannah] That's the deal.

1:22:29.890 --> 1:22:31.829
I'm not giving you another
chance to freak out.

1:22:31.830 --> 1:22:33.079
Got it?

1:22:33.080 --> 1:22:33.913
- Got it.

1:22:36.020 --> 1:22:37.863
- It's intimidating though, isn't it?

1:22:40.690 --> 1:22:43.639
Most of us never have the
chance to run the big race,

1:22:43.640 --> 1:22:45.040
and even fewer of us win it.

1:22:47.613 --> 1:22:48.893
- Are you nervous?

1:22:51.920 --> 1:22:52.753
- Nope.

1:22:54.080 --> 1:22:55.630
- Good. Neither am I.
