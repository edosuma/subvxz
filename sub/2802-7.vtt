-White Board?
-No, no, <i>White Bored.</i> Spelled B-O-R-E-D.

His pieces are a master study

03:06.728 --> 03:09.314

-Excellent.

Why are the marshals here?

03:23.078 --> 03:24.621
I guess you're gonna find out.

03:28.041 --> 03:31.086
Neal, this is John Deckard
from the Marshal's office.

03:31.170 --> 03:33.255
Are you sure it's necessary
to bring him in?

03:33.338 --> 03:35.632
Neal, how long did you evade
the US Marshals?

03:35.716 --> 03:38.927
Well, technically, they never found me.
You did.

03:39.011 --> 03:41.388
As I heard it,
you had the marshals searching for you

03:41.471 --> 03:43.015

FBI Agent Jack Franklin
is currently a fugitive.

03:57.905 --> 03:59.364

in the White Collar branch.

04:01.700 --> 04:03.785
-Did you know him?
-Not well.

04:03.869 --> 04:06.538
He transferred in from the Chicago office
a couple years ago,

04:06.622 --> 04:09.166
then he got bumped down
to Internal Bank Fraud.

04:09.249 --> 04:10.918
Isn't that the Siberia of assignments?

04:11.001 --> 04:13.212
Maybe the Bureau
should have fired him instead.

04:13.295 --> 04:17.716
US Marshals caught him
trying to access their witness database.

04:17.799 --> 04:19.009
Oh.

04:19.092 --> 04:22.137
Deckard, do you wanna
coordinate the search?

04:22.221 --> 04:25.641

we loop you in.

it's gonna be the FBI.

there's no way.

11:35.571 --> 11:38.448
He needs to come in.
It's the only way we can clear him.

11:38.532 --> 11:40.868
I told you, I don't know where he is.

11:40.951 --> 11:42.494
All right, listen. Listen.

11:42.578 --> 11:45.163
If you two do make contact,

11:45.247 --> 11:48.208
let him know that
I'll make him this promise.

11:48.292 --> 11:49.835
I'm willing to listen.

12:03.307 --> 12:04.975
-Uh…
-What?

12:05.058 --> 12:10.522
Ahem. I know that you think
I only took the car out to talk.

12:10.606 --> 12:12.691
Clearly you didn't take it out
to drive it.

12:12.774 --> 12:14.693
No, but…

12:14.776 --> 12:18.363
I need an honest answer on one more thing.

12:19.239 --> 12:21.033
I've been with the Bureau for 12 years.

12:21.116 --> 12:23.035
I've got perfect credit.

12:23.118 --> 12:25.329
Can I get financed on one of these?

12:25.412 --> 12:27.915
You'd have better luck
seizing one from a drug dealer.

12:30.292 --> 12:32.878
-Hey.
-Hey, Rebecca. So glad you're back.

12:32.961 --> 12:35.172
This is Dan.
He's buying the yellow Gallardo.

12:35.255 --> 12:36.924
Dan, Rebecca will take it from here.

12:37.007 --> 12:39.301
-Congratulations, my friend.
-Thanks.

12:42.095 --> 12:43.680
What were you thinking?

12:49.144 --> 12:50.979
Her drive log from yesterday? So?

12:51.063 --> 12:54.399
3:45 p.m., she took a test drive
with Claudia Weaver.

12:54.483 --> 12:57.486
Claudia Weaver?
That's one of Rebecca's aliases.

12:57.569 --> 13:00.322
So she took herself for an hour-and-a-half
spin in a Porsche.

13:00.405 --> 13:02.533
Any idea where she and her alias went?

13:02.616 --> 13:04.868
Luckily the cars come equipped
with a GPS tracking device.

13:04.952 --> 13:07.412
(LAUGHING) Just like you.

13:07.496 --> 13:08.997
Just like me.

13:15.295 --> 13:17.631
Franklin shows up at her showroom.

13:17.714 --> 13:20.175
Rebecca tells everyone
she's going for a test drive.

13:20.259 --> 13:23.220
And she parks the car here.

13:23.303 --> 13:25.097
Or Franklin phoned her and they met there.

13:25.180 --> 13:27.474
-Mmm-hmm.
-Boss, look at this file.

13:31.854 --> 13:33.647
Sullivan anti-trust case.

13:33.730 --> 13:35.232
It's the case Franklin was working on

13:35.315 --> 13:37.067
before he got transferred
from White Collar.

13:37.150 --> 13:38.443
Where'd you find it?

13:38.527 --> 13:41.071
In a locked file drawer
in Franklin's office.

13:41.154 --> 13:43.699
I got in there before
I let the marshals search it.

13:48.161 --> 13:50.247
That's Deckard.

13:50.330 --> 13:52.165
Are these all US Marshals?

13:53.792 --> 13:54.918
No, not all of them.

13:55.002 --> 13:57.129
Some are witnesses.

13:57.212 --> 13:59.214
This guy's a lawyer. So is this guy.

13:59.298 --> 14:01.675
DECKARD: Have you found anything?
Where's Agent Burke?

14:01.758 --> 14:03.218
-Peter.
-Hmm.

14:03.302 --> 14:05.721
AGENT: He's upstairs
in the conference room.

14:09.892 --> 14:11.810
Come on.

14:11.894 --> 14:12.895
Wait a minute.

14:12.978 --> 14:15.814
If it's a canvas commentary,
why would he use white…

14:15.898 --> 14:17.357
Burke.

14:17.441 --> 14:19.026
Any leads?

14:19.109 --> 14:22.154
Deckard, little heads-up
when you're on your way over here.

14:22.237 --> 14:25.616
Hey, what did Franklin's CI say to you?
Did she give you a location?

14:25.699 --> 14:27.701
Well, we don't have anything yet.

14:27.784 --> 14:30.287
But how did you know
that we met with Rebecca Vidal?

14:30.370 --> 14:32.873
The marshals can track my anklet.

14:33.624 --> 14:35.209
I heard you were quick.

14:35.292 --> 14:37.878
Are those Franklin's files?

14:37.961 --> 14:39.880
Just the files you gave us this morning.

14:39.963 --> 14:41.590
You know,
just because Franklin's one of you

14:41.673 --> 14:43.091
doesn't make him any less guilty.

14:43.175 --> 14:44.843
We're on the same team.

14:44.927 --> 14:47.179
Jones, show him what we have.

14:51.683 --> 14:54.478
You're not sharing the file
from Franklin's office.

14:54.561 --> 14:57.105
-Think I'll take it home with me.
-Working from home.

14:57.189 --> 14:59.441
That's one way to avoid them
looking over your shoulder.

14:59.525 --> 15:00.609
Here's the other way.

15:00.692 --> 15:03.237
You stay here
and let them look over your shoulder.

15:03.320 --> 15:04.488
With pleasure.

15:04.571 --> 15:07.783
Oh, Peter,
have fun cooking your pot roast.

15:20.379 --> 15:21.755
(TIMER DINGS)

15:29.429 --> 15:30.430
(RUSTLING OUTSIDE)

15:52.619 --> 15:54.454
Jack Franklin?

15:54.538 --> 15:56.540
FRANKLIN: Agent Burke?

15:56.623 --> 15:58.125
You said you'd listen.

15:58.208 --> 15:59.668
So here I am.

16:16.351 --> 16:19.104
-I need you to lower your weapon.
-I can't do that.

16:19.188 --> 16:21.607
Put your gun down, Jack.

16:21.690 --> 16:24.067
-House rules.
-I know your rep, Peter.

16:24.151 --> 16:26.987
And I'm here because you play straight.
You said you'd listen.

16:27.070 --> 16:30.032
But I'm not surrendering my weapon
to you or anyone else.

16:30.115 --> 16:32.284
Not until I can get the truth out.

16:32.367 --> 16:34.870
Holster your weapon and we'll talk.

16:41.335 --> 16:42.628
Hey, Mozz.

16:43.837 --> 16:44.838
Sorry, I'm late.

16:44.922 --> 16:48.300
So they conscripted your Saturdays.
Go, FBI.

16:50.344 --> 16:51.678
Found anything?

16:51.762 --> 16:56.058
I deciphered the phone number
that Kate dialed from the plane.

16:56.141 --> 16:59.478
I traced it
to a store-bought burner phone.

16:59.561 --> 17:01.355
So no names associated with it?

17:01.438 --> 17:02.564
Not yet.

17:02.648 --> 17:07.110
But, "the reason for time is so that
everything doesn't happen at once."

17:07.194 --> 17:09.363
It's been a while
since you quoted Einstein.

17:09.446 --> 17:11.156
It means you're in a groove.

17:11.240 --> 17:13.492
Well, "great spirits
have often encountered

17:13.575 --> 17:16.870
"violent opposition from weaker minds."

17:21.333 --> 17:23.043
The pot roast smells good.

17:23.126 --> 17:26.713
(CHUCKLES) You're kind of screwing up
my date night with my wife.

17:27.840 --> 17:31.134
You wanna talk to me
about those accusations?

17:31.218 --> 17:34.429
I was working on the Sullivan
anti-trust case.

17:34.513 --> 17:37.266
After two years,
looked like I finally had a witness

17:37.349 --> 17:39.017
who was willing to come forward.

17:39.101 --> 17:41.979
One week before his testimony,
he's killed in a hit-and-run.

17:42.062 --> 17:44.106
That's when you started
poking around the marshals' office.

17:44.189 --> 17:45.774
Well, they were the only ones
aside from me

17:45.858 --> 17:47.568
who knew where the witness was.

17:47.651 --> 17:51.530
A few days after I start asking questions,
OPR gets wind of me and Rebecca.

17:51.613 --> 17:53.740
Next thing I know,
I'm transferred into Bank Fraud.

17:53.824 --> 17:55.117
Why didn't you tell anybody?

17:55.200 --> 17:57.828
Well, I tried.
But I didn't have any proof.

17:57.911 --> 18:01.373
Why now? Why did Deckard
start going after you today?

18:01.456 --> 18:04.251
I made a breakthrough.
And Deckard knows I'm on to him.

18:04.334 --> 18:08.046
Yesterday, I hacked into
one of the defense attorney's systems.

18:08.338 --> 18:10.132
That's Volker in the Sullivan case.

18:10.215 --> 18:12.759
I found a reference in an e-mail chain
to a hard-copy ledger.

18:12.843 --> 18:14.636
-What's on it?
-As far as I can tell

18:14.720 --> 18:17.306
it's got every transaction
Volker did with Deckard.

18:17.389 --> 18:20.058
The witness names,
how much he paid Deckard,

18:20.142 --> 18:21.185
the names on the accounts.

18:21.268 --> 18:24.062
Volker keeps it in his office
in case Deckard tries to turn on him.

18:24.146 --> 18:25.314
Hang on.

18:26.440 --> 18:29.985
You and Rebecca went to Volker's office
yesterday to look for it.

18:30.068 --> 18:32.154
We were casing it out. How did you know?

18:32.237 --> 18:35.115
We followed the GPS data
on her test drive.

18:35.199 --> 18:36.491
Does Deckard know this?

18:36.575 --> 18:38.118
It's his case.

18:38.202 --> 18:40.245
But if Deckard knows
I went to Volker's office,

18:40.329 --> 18:43.081
he's gonna head there.
And if he gets that hard copy…

18:43.999 --> 18:47.836
Jack. We do this together or not at all.

18:47.920 --> 18:49.880
-Okay.
-You're a fugitive.

18:49.963 --> 18:53.800
There's a warrant for your arrest.
I need you to surrender your weapon.

19:02.476 --> 19:03.977
Good. Let's go.

19:09.107 --> 19:11.026
I'm telling you, Jones,
you cannot miss this.

19:11.109 --> 19:15.072
It's mostly office motifs, right?
Imagine Shepard Fairey meets <i>Dilbert.</i>

19:15.155 --> 19:16.406
That means nothing to me.

19:19.993 --> 19:22.496
-And you compare that to this.
-Where's Deckard?

19:22.579 --> 19:24.790
He went to chase down a lead.

19:24.873 --> 19:26.917
-Where?
-He didn't say.

19:38.387 --> 19:39.847
(CELL PHONE VIBRATING)

19:41.557 --> 19:42.558
Yeah?

19:43.267 --> 19:46.019
Peter. Neal and I
are on speaker in your office.

19:46.103 --> 19:48.105
-PETER: <i>What's going on?</i>
-Deckard left the FBI.

19:48.188 --> 19:49.857
Who are you on the phone with?

19:49.940 --> 19:51.817
Jack, don't break in.

19:51.900 --> 19:53.151
Are you with Jack Franklin?

19:53.235 --> 19:54.987
Yeah, at Volker's office.

19:55.070 --> 19:58.699
Franklin says that Deckard is the one
who's selling witness information.

19:58.782 --> 20:01.368
<i>And there's evidence</i>
<i>in</i><i>Volker's office to prove it.</i>

20:01.451 --> 20:02.911
That may be where Deckard went.

20:02.995 --> 20:05.080
Wait, wait, Peter, you're with Franklin?

20:05.163 --> 20:06.832
<i>-Yeah.</i>
-Do you need backup?

20:06.915 --> 20:09.751
No, we're in Glen Cove.
It would take a half-hour to get here.

20:09.835 --> 20:11.587
-I'm not waiting for backup.
-Jack.

20:11.670 --> 20:12.754
That evidence is my only hope.

20:12.838 --> 20:14.965
You can wait here
or follow a fleeing suspect.

20:15.048 --> 20:18.010
-Peter, I'm gonna call local PD.
<i>-No, I'll manage.</i>

-Yeah?

but he's coming with me.

that you're in contact with Rebecca.

23:35.457 --> 23:37.876
He's gonna go after her
to try to get to you.

23:37.960 --> 23:41.630
There was a reason
that you were willing to risk your career

23:41.713 --> 23:44.216
for the witness who was killed
in the Sullivan case.

23:44.299 --> 23:46.635
I know you still believe in our system.

23:46.718 --> 23:49.429
Okay. You had me at,
"He's gonna go after Rebecca."

23:49.513 --> 23:50.931
(CAR APPROACHING)

23:54.393 --> 23:56.186
It's all right. It's all right.

23:59.481 --> 24:01.942
The car's got a tracking device
as good as my anklet.

24:02.025 --> 24:03.986
PETER: Can you disable it?

24:04.069 --> 24:05.195
Why? You're not coming in?

24:05.279 --> 24:07.906
It's complicated.
We gotta lose the marshals.

24:07.990 --> 24:09.700
They're not gonna be far behind us.

24:09.783 --> 24:11.451
Then you better get started.

24:14.830 --> 24:16.665
Oh. Of course.

24:24.423 --> 24:27.342
Do I understand correctly
that Peter Burke is on the run?

24:27.426 --> 24:30.721
-The same Peter Burke who would never run.
-No talking.

24:34.850 --> 24:36.435
Tracking disabled.

24:37.394 --> 24:39.646
-You okay?
-Getting there.

24:40.647 --> 24:44.109
We're gonna need a place to hide out
until we figure out our next steps.

24:44.193 --> 24:46.236
-I think I can manage that.
-Good.

24:47.404 --> 24:48.906
You must be Agent Franklin.

24:50.490 --> 24:52.701
PETER: All right,
you two head back to the FBI.

24:52.784 --> 24:55.370
Any further contact will be through Diana.

(ELEVATOR BELL DINGS)

25:21.271 --> 25:22.272
Hello, sir.

25:22.814 --> 25:23.815
Where's Peter?

25:24.441 --> 25:25.776
I see you've spoken with Deckard.

25:25.859 --> 25:27.736
He said that Franklin
was destroying evidence

25:27.819 --> 25:29.571
and that Peter helped him flee.

25:36.912 --> 25:38.830
I believe Peter is still with Franklin.

25:38.914 --> 25:39.915
Why?

25:39.998 --> 25:43.794
He thinks Deckard is selling
the witness information, not Franklin.

25:43.877 --> 25:45.504
-Really?
-Yeah. There was proof

25:45.587 --> 25:47.965
in Volker's office, but Deckard
got there first and destroyed it.

25:48.048 --> 25:49.258
-You were there?
-No.

25:49.341 --> 25:50.342
So you don't know that.

25:50.425 --> 25:53.095
Peter wouldn't have fled unless
he thought Franklin was in real danger.

25:53.178 --> 25:54.388
So why didn't he come in?

25:54.471 --> 25:57.224
Because he wanted your permission
to stay out there with Franklin

25:57.307 --> 25:59.810
while they work out a way to prove
Deckard is behind this.

26:00.519 --> 26:02.521
-Get Peter on the phone.
-He tossed it.

26:02.604 --> 26:04.398
So, then he isn't really
asking permission.

26:04.481 --> 26:06.859
-I guess it was more of an FYI.
-Mmm.

26:06.942 --> 26:09.152
Look, this can work in our favor.

26:09.236 --> 26:10.654
Deckard doesn't know we suspect him.

26:10.737 --> 26:12.531
And he'll probably try to keep
Jones and I close

26:12.614 --> 26:13.782
in case Peter contacts us.

26:13.866 --> 26:15.450
Oh, you want me to authorize you

26:15.534 --> 26:17.911
to mislead the US Marshals
to buy Peter time.

26:17.995 --> 26:20.747
-Yeah.
-I will let you know.

28:19.241 --> 28:22.578
Hey. What did you find on Volker?

28:22.661 --> 28:24.705
He has one of the highest
acquittal rates in the city.

28:24.788 --> 28:28.375
Moreover, he won his last three cases
when a key witness disappeared or died.

28:28.458 --> 28:29.585
So, what's the plan?

28:29.668 --> 28:32.796
If Bancroft buys off,
Jones and I will keep Deckard occupied.

That will free you up
for Peter to contact.

How do you know him?

are all the guy ever talks about.

the real reason you're not behind bars

30:52.477 --> 30:54.188
I assume you're protecting him.

So let's all be very honest
about why we're here.

30:57.441 --> 31:00.819

he's gonna contact her or one of you guys.

-Yeah. What are you doing here?
-Date night.

31:55.999 --> 31:57.668
So a US Marshal…

31:57.751 --> 32:00.462
A dirty US Marshal named John Deckard.

32:00.546 --> 32:04.132
…has been selling the locations
of witnesses to a defense attorney…

32:04.216 --> 32:05.467
A devious defense attorney.

32:05.551 --> 32:07.636
…and he's been using this information
to intimidate…

32:07.719 --> 32:09.012
And kill witnesses.

32:09.096 --> 32:11.431
Which is why your noble husband

32:11.515 --> 32:14.893
leapt to the aid
of a wrongfully accused FBI agent.

32:14.977 --> 32:17.437
Who inadvertently
commandeered my date night.

32:18.730 --> 32:20.107
And here I am.

32:21.441 --> 32:22.985
What exactly is the plan?

32:24.528 --> 32:26.488
The less I tell you, the better,

32:26.572 --> 32:29.408
just in case
Deckard tries to interrogate you.

32:31.910 --> 32:34.288
Have you ever heard
of a prisoner's dilemma?

32:34.371 --> 32:37.541
Yeah, it's the idea of, uh,
separating two suspects

32:37.624 --> 32:39.126
and getting them
to turn on each other, right?

32:39.209 --> 32:41.378
Yes, but this is
a little more challenging.

32:41.461 --> 32:42.838
Is Neal involved in this?

32:43.714 --> 32:47.259
He is, but Peter hasn't told him yet,
which is one of our challenges.

32:47.342 --> 32:49.761
But we've done more with less.

32:49.845 --> 32:51.013
Is my husband okay?

32:52.389 --> 32:53.557
Oh, right.

34:01.375 --> 34:03.502
Huh, to say Thursday has a view

34:03.585 --> 34:07.297
is like saying the Hubble Telescope
has a magnifying glass.

Did you lose him?

36:38.031 --> 36:39.032
It's Deckard, sir.

36:39.116 --> 36:41.535
Deckard, put Caffrey back on.

36:42.244 --> 36:43.453
Yes, sir.

36:46.290 --> 36:47.374
I'm back.

36:47.457 --> 36:49.668
Okay. Have you ever run
a prisoner's dilemma?

36:49.751 --> 36:51.378
I've been in one.

36:51.461 --> 36:54.214
Well, now's your chance to run it
on a US Marshal.

36:54.298 --> 36:55.507
You clear on what to do?

36:55.591 --> 36:58.594
Crystal clear. Thank you, sir.

36:59.386 --> 37:00.387
(CELL PHONE BEEPS)

37:04.683 --> 37:07.186
-What's going on?
-Just follow my lead.

37:09.563 --> 37:13.734
Stan 1 was stolen earlier today
and apparently taken on quite a joyride.

37:13.817 --> 37:16.570
They thought
they could bring it here for parts.

37:18.113 --> 37:19.406
What are they doing in there?

37:19.489 --> 37:21.950
I think you know
what they're doing in there.

37:24.661 --> 37:25.913
That's it.

37:27.414 --> 37:28.665
Who did this?

37:28.749 --> 37:31.293
We have them in custody, Mr. Volker.
Don't worry.

37:31.376 --> 37:32.920
Oh, they're gonna pay.

37:38.133 --> 37:39.510
DIANA: Just need your signature.

37:40.928 --> 37:44.097
If you could read over
this statement for me.

37:44.181 --> 37:46.058
I think you'll find everything's in order.

37:49.895 --> 37:53.732
Volker's cutting a deal with the FBI.
He's selling you out.

38:01.031 --> 38:02.824
NEAL: Yup, there it is.

38:03.492 --> 38:05.118
A signed confession.

38:07.079 --> 38:08.914
See, once you showed up
in Volker's office,

38:08.997 --> 38:11.291
he knew it was only a matter of time
before you turned on him.

38:11.375 --> 38:12.626
He made a deal.

38:13.627 --> 38:15.254
Come on, Deckard.

38:15.337 --> 38:16.880
Don't make it harder than it is.

38:16.964 --> 38:18.423
There is one more thing.

38:24.471 --> 38:25.931
What is this all about?

38:26.014 --> 38:28.183
Deckard says you paid off an FBI agent.

38:28.267 --> 38:30.811
to intimidate and kill witnesses
in federal trials.

38:30.894 --> 38:32.938
You're looking at 25 to life.

38:33.021 --> 38:35.232
Unless you start talking.

38:37.943 --> 38:39.862
Deckard came up with the whole thing.

38:39.945 --> 38:41.363
What do you wanna know about him?

38:41.446 --> 38:42.781
-Give it up.
-Stay back.

38:43.657 --> 38:47.494
Hands up, Deckard. It's over.

38:47.578 --> 38:48.829
Put the gun down on the ground.

38:57.546 --> 39:00.799
You realize the grief you caused me
with Bancroft when you fled?

39:00.883 --> 39:04.887
Yeah, on this side of a manhunt,
isn't all peaches and dandelions, is it?

39:08.515 --> 39:10.184
It beats being led away in cuffs.

39:14.771 --> 39:16.732
Good working with you, Deckard.

39:31.663 --> 39:33.248
(INAUDIBLE)

39:42.674 --> 39:43.800
How did it go?

39:44.760 --> 39:47.262
They've cleared Franklin of all charges.

39:47.346 --> 39:50.140
Bancroft's reinstating him
into the White Collar Division.

39:50.224 --> 39:52.935
It's great work, everyone.
Let's get some rest.

40:00.901 --> 40:02.236
Ahem. Neal.

40:04.613 --> 40:05.739
Good work.

40:08.325 --> 40:09.409
Thank you.

40:12.829 --> 40:14.581
Yeah, I'll be headed home too.

40:15.999 --> 40:20.462
Won't be going to the Powell today,
because, you know, it's outside my radius.

40:20.546 --> 40:21.755
Please?

40:29.763 --> 40:31.098
(CELL PHONE RINGS)

40:35.602 --> 40:37.521
Thanks for playing last night, Mozz.

40:37.604 --> 40:40.816
Oh, the follow-the-leader stuff?
That was child's play.

40:40.899 --> 40:42.568
The reason I'm calling now

40:42.651 --> 40:45.612
is because I've obtained
some information since then.

40:45.696 --> 40:47.114
What did you find?

40:47.197 --> 40:49.199
I know who Kate called from the plane.

40:49.283 --> 40:53.871
It was the FBI agent who set up the deal
between you and Kate.

40:54.496 --> 40:55.831
Garrett Fowler.

40:57.541 --> 40:59.459
Now I need to find him.

40:59.543 --> 41:00.919
Caffrey.

41:02.087 --> 41:04.590
-I'll get right back to you.

41:07.634 --> 41:09.595
Ahem. Sir?

41:11.346 --> 41:12.431
Come here.

41:17.060 --> 41:18.812
You planning on seeing this?

41:19.146 --> 41:22.441
Well, yeah, I was, but, you know,
it's out of my range and…

41:23.609 --> 41:24.776
Uh-huh.

41:25.444 --> 41:29.114
(SIGHS) I've wanted to see this thing
since it opened. (CLICKS TONGUE)

41:36.205 --> 41:37.247
Let's go.

41:38.457 --> 41:40.000
You know, from the moment I met you,

41:40.083 --> 41:41.502
I could tell you were a man
of refined tastes.

41:42.377 --> 41:45.756
Oh, I know, hon.
I'll be home in 15 minutes tops.

41:47.382 --> 41:49.468
No, I can't wait either.

41:49.551 --> 41:53.847
Just a few hours sleep
and I'll be yours all day… and night.

42:08.820 --> 42:10.280
