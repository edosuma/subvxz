BART: Danny!

03:02.600 --> 03:03.874
Attaboy!

03:06.200 --> 03:09.272
You borrow money from me,
you're expected to pay it back.

03:09.360 --> 03:11.192
When you pay it back,
the collar stays on.

03:11.280 --> 03:13.351
You don't pay it back,
the collar comes off.

03:13.440 --> 03:14.635
It's a simple set of rules.

(GROANS)

03:15.840 --> 03:18.480

Behave.

03:24.800 --> 03:27.758
It's nice. We'll be back.
Come on, Danny boy.

03:32.800 --> 03:34.393
BART: Well, I had
a dream last night.

03:34.480 --> 03:39.111
I was sitting under those umbrellas that
they make out of palm leaves, you know?

03:39.200 --> 03:42.909
And these beautiful
golden-skinned girls

03:43.000 --> 03:46.470
dressed in just, like,
little grass skirts

03:46.560 --> 03:48.790
and the skin
that they was born in.

03:48.880 --> 03:51.633
Yeah. And they came over,
one after the other.

03:54.120 --> 03:56.555
And they brought me a drink
in a coconut.

03:56.640 --> 04:00.554
And as they served me the drink, they
brushed their tits across my face.

04:00.640 --> 04:01.835
Cor! Bloody hell!

04:01.920 --> 04:04.594
Hey, boss, I think Georgie's
getting a chubby.

04:04.720 --> 04:08.031
You shut up, Lefty. You're the one
getting a fucking hard-on, not me.

04:08.440 --> 04:12.229
Ah, well, that was
the end of the best bits.

04:12.760 --> 04:15.832
After the girls, the whole
thing turned to shit.

04:17.440 --> 04:20.079
This giant mumpet turned up
with a machine gun.

04:20.160 --> 04:22.470
Started blasting away
until there was

04:22.880 --> 04:26.635
nothing but blood and guts
and bits of body everywhere.

04:26.720 --> 04:27.994
Nice One.

04:28.840 --> 04:30.638
It was a real nightmare.

04:36.200 --> 04:39.192
I bet you've never had a dream
in your life, have you?

04:41.520 --> 04:44.239
Yeah, must be peaceful.

04:44.840 --> 04:45.910
Here.

04:46.360 --> 04:47.998
Have a bit of that.

04:48.080 --> 04:49.878
That's it. That's it.

04:51.560 --> 04:52.914
I hate dreams.

Hey.

04:56.560 --> 04:58.631
Yo, Righty, you mad bastard.

04:58.720 --> 05:00.870
Righty, how did you get on?
Hello, guv'nor.

05:00.960 --> 05:03.759
All my people
paid to the penny. 2700.

05:03.880 --> 05:06.315
Perfect. Give the lads a drink.
Cheers, guv'nor.

05:06.400 --> 05:08.960
Yeah? What do you
want done with Danny?

05:09.040 --> 05:12.431
Well, sort him out.
His face is bleeding, look. Sort him out.

05:12.520 --> 05:14.352
Anybody have any trouble?

05:14.760 --> 05:16.353
Put it on there.

05:16.440 --> 05:17.714
Oh, nice.

05:23.360 --> 05:25.351
Come on, Danny,
you heard the guv'nor.

05:25.440 --> 05:27.397
Here's a bonus, all right?

05:28.160 --> 05:30.310
Sort yourself out, okay?

05:31.320 --> 05:32.754
Come on, Danny.

05:32.840 --> 05:34.433

That's it, that's it.
Hold it.

07:29.040 --> 07:31.236
Yeah. It's beautiful.

07:31.440 --> 07:35.195
Beautiful. Oi. Oi.
Get back in the car.

07:35.440 --> 07:36.510
Fucking beast.

07:37.000 --> 07:38.274
Fucking wanker.

07:38.360 --> 07:41.159
I wanna get a close-up,
that's it. Right, that's it.

07:43.160 --> 07:46.391
Let's have a look.
Don't put your hands on it, you'll mark it.

07:46.480 --> 07:47.800
Oh, hello.

07:49.040 --> 07:50.519
Look at him.

07:51.720 --> 07:53.950
No, not here.
Oh, yes.

07:54.040 --> 07:57.158
Yes, you're right.
Let's go somewhere more comfortable.

08:03.400 --> 08:06.313
No, turn the light on.
No light.

08:06.400 --> 08:08.391
Turn on the lights.

Jesus! You sick bastard! Hey!

08:29.360 --> 08:31.431
Where you going?
Fuck you.

08:33.720 --> 08:35.198
Much obliged!

08:36.080 --> 08:37.753

08:55.920 --> 08:57.194

08:57.640 --> 08:59.199
Hey, hey, hey, Nigel!

09:00.960 --> 09:04.476
Okay, Bart, all right,
you want this? Yeah.

09:14.480 --> 09:15.550
Fuck!

09:22.480 --> 09:25.836
Turn it round, keep it running and
keep your eye out for the old bill.

09:25.960 --> 09:28.634
Good luck, son.
Luck? He don't need it, bro.

(LIGHTER CLICKS SHUT)

09:50.840 --> 09:52.672
You know what
I've always found fascinating

09:52.760 --> 09:55.149
about this whole situation
of yours, Bart, buddy?

09:56.440 --> 09:58.317
How you basically turned a man

09:59.240 --> 10:00.639
into a dog.

10:00.720 --> 10:03.109
Well, it's like
my sainted mum used to say,

10:03.200 --> 10:06.636
"Get them young enough and the
possibilities are endless."

10:07.320 --> 10:09.357
Unlike yours at the moment.

10:09.720 --> 10:10.869
So, um...

10:11.880 --> 10:14.156
So let me work this through
one more time.

10:14.240 --> 10:18.711
I don't pay you, you take his collar off.
Correctimundo.

10:19.360 --> 10:21.920
You take his collar off,
he beats us all to death.

10:22.000 --> 10:24.992
Now,
who's the bright penny, hmm?

10:25.360 --> 10:28.113
So it's in my best interest
to keep that collar on.

with the master, kill the dog.

12:13.720 --> 12:15.631
I don't know what it is
with people.

12:16.400 --> 12:18.277
Maybe I've got
a speech deficiency.

12:18.360 --> 12:20.590
Take what you want.
Oh, no.

12:20.840 --> 12:23.400
My mum didn't bring me up
to be a pig.

12:23.480 --> 12:25.312
Not like some people I know.

12:25.840 --> 12:27.672
I only take what I'm owed.

12:28.120 --> 12:29.713
But this time...

12:31.680 --> 12:32.829
Yeah.

12:34.160 --> 12:35.992
With a little interest.

12:36.560 --> 12:40.713
Because you are
such a fucking asshole.

12:50.480 --> 12:51.629
Come on.

12:54.040 --> 12:55.235
What are you looking at?

12:55.680 --> 12:57.193
Just enjoying the show.

12:58.040 --> 12:59.155
Good.

13:03.520 --> 13:05.431
Don't you ever
leave my side again.

13:05.520 --> 13:06.794
You said,
"Stay in the car."

13:06.880 --> 13:08.473
Shut the fuck up.

13:09.840 --> 13:11.319
Get in, bitch.

13:19.920 --> 13:21.115
I don't believe it.

13:21.200 --> 13:23.953
He just stood there and watched
them beat the crap out of me.

13:24.040 --> 13:28.477
Even a dog has got the brains to
come to his master's defense.

13:28.560 --> 13:32.872
Bites them! Claw them! Piss on them!
Anything, for fuck's sake.

13:33.080 --> 13:34.275
Jesus.

13:34.360 --> 13:36.112
Jesus,boss,
you don't look too good.

13:38.720 --> 13:40.119
Another original thinker.

13:40.200 --> 13:42.157
Oh, no. I just meant that
maybe you might wanna go home.

13:42.240 --> 13:44.629
What's next?
Just the antiques place.

13:45.160 --> 13:47.470
No, let's do it.
Are you sure you're up to this?

13:47.560 --> 13:52.270
No, no. You let one of them payments slide
and they'll all turn into original thinkers.

13:52.360 --> 13:55.352
Find a decent pub first,
though. I want a pint.

13:55.560 --> 13:57.756
And you,
you useless piece of shit.

14:04.880 --> 14:06.029
There.

14:18.600 --> 14:21.956
Right. Now, here's the plan.

14:22.520 --> 14:26.878
I'm gonna try and settle this in a
peaceful and professional manner.

14:27.040 --> 14:29.759
(ECHOING) But if that doesn't
work, I'm gonna press this...

14:29.840 --> 14:32.275
Hey! Oi! Oi!
You pay attention.

14:32.720 --> 14:37.112
Now, when I press this button, this red
light is gonna start blinking. Right?

14:37.520 --> 14:38.919
The red light blinks,

14:39.000 --> 14:42.470
you go through that door quicker
than a mouse chasing a bit of...

14:42.560 --> 14:44.312
Keep your hands
off him, will you?

14:44.400 --> 14:46.277
And stop fucking smirking!

14:46.360 --> 14:49.478
The red light blinks...
Look at me, concentrate.

14:49.560 --> 14:51.676
The red light blinks,
you go through the door.

14:51.760 --> 14:53.512
That's all
you've gotta remember. Right?

14:53.600 --> 14:55.193
Light. Door.

14:55.480 --> 14:56.834
Light. Door.

14:56.920 --> 14:58.991
Light. Door. Oi!

15:00.280 --> 15:02.669
Right. And don't
take your eyes off the light

15:02.760 --> 15:04.512
and don't let me down.

15:05.520 --> 15:07.193
Georgie?
Yes, Bart.

15:07.280 --> 15:09.157
Hang that up there.
What, up there?

15:11.360 --> 15:12.509
Come here.

15:14.960 --> 15:16.075
Au right.

15:16.600 --> 15:18.716
The light, Danny. The light.

15:19.000 --> 15:21.435
Red means go. Right?

16:13.440 --> 16:14.589
(GASPS)

16:14.840 --> 16:17.719
Sounds like someone in here
could use my help.

16:17.800 --> 16:18.995
(LAUGHS)

16:19.600 --> 16:22.399
Hi. How you doing?

16:23.240 --> 16:27.199
I'm just gonna tune these pianos.
Probably be a couple of hours.

16:29.880 --> 16:31.314
If you don't mind.

16:31.400 --> 16:32.515
(PLAYING)

16:36.560 --> 16:38.198
You like pianos?

16:40.280 --> 16:43.636
Yeah, me, too. Of course, you know,
this whole place is like a...

16:44.000 --> 16:46.071
It's like
a big treasure chest.

16:46.920 --> 16:50.834
Probably gonna be a whole month getting
all these ladies back into health.

16:52.360 --> 16:55.273
You know, tuning pianos
is really hard work,

16:55.360 --> 16:57.670
and my back
isn't what it used to be.

16:58.760 --> 17:01.036
Are you doing
anything important right now?

17:01.120 --> 17:04.112
'Cause I could really use a hand here.
How about it?

17:06.079 --> 17:07.275
Please.

17:09.599 --> 17:11.352
Are you still there?

17:15.599 --> 17:17.352
You are, aren't you?

17:19.000 --> 17:20.115
Yes..

17:20.960 --> 17:23.109
Good. Good.

17:23.240 --> 17:24.513
Come on.

17:33.160 --> 17:36.676
You know, a lot of people think because
a piano's so big, it is very strong,

17:36.760 --> 17:39.878
and you can just pound on it any way
you want to and nothing will happen.

17:39.960 --> 17:43.157
But that's not so at all.
Pianos are a lot like people.

17:43.360 --> 17:46.671
I mean, you pound on a person,
they get out of tune.

17:47.040 --> 17:48.519
Same with a piano.

17:48.720 --> 17:50.358
You pound on them and...

17:50.880 --> 17:54.157
Oh, Lordy, listen to that.
Huh? Sad as a baby crying.

17:54.840 --> 17:56.990
I'll tell you
what I want you to do now.

17:57.280 --> 18:00.113
When I say press, I want you
to press on these keys.

18:00.200 --> 18:02.714
Starting with this one right
here and going to the right.

18:02.800 --> 18:06.714
One, then two, then three.

18:06.800 --> 18:08.199
Think you can do that?

18:09.280 --> 18:11.669
Okay. Put your hand here,
just like that.

18:12.200 --> 18:13.349
All right?

18:13.440 --> 18:14.999
Oh! Oh!

18:15.520 --> 18:17.397
Oh, my goodness!
Oh. Wait a minute.

18:17.480 --> 18:20.472
Loosen up.
Loosen up. That's it.

18:20.560 --> 18:24.599
Music's got to flow from within, you know.
Can't flow if you're all stiff.

18:24.680 --> 18:26.034
On the key there.

18:26.280 --> 18:27.634
Just relax.

18:27.840 --> 18:29.433
Nothing to be afraid of.

18:29.520 --> 18:33.070
And there we are.
Are you ready?

18:33.920 --> 18:35.672
And press.

18:37.560 --> 18:39.039
A little harder.

18:40.360 --> 18:41.998
Good. Again. Good.

18:42.080 --> 18:44.879

for this sort of work.

18:45.240 --> 18:48.596
Okay, press it again. Press.

18:49.880 --> 18:53.077
Oh, wonderful.

Ready?

18:56.680 --> 18:58.353
Press. Press.

18:58.440 --> 19:00.829
Go ahead. Relax.
Let the energy flow.

19:00.920 --> 19:04.993
Let the magic happen!
Good. Good. Good. Good.

19:05.560 --> 19:07.551
Excellent. Excellent.

19:07.640 --> 19:10.553
Oh, no, wait, wait, wait.
Hold on.

19:17.880 --> 19:18.915
Yes..

19:19.000 --> 19:20.229
Check this out.

19:21.560 --> 19:23.358
Is that the sweetest
sound or what?

19:24.240 --> 19:25.514
Yes..

19:25.640 --> 19:27.039
Want to try it?

19:27.640 --> 19:29.517
Here, go on.
Put your hand here.

19:29.600 --> 19:32.479
Put your fingers right there,
there and there.

19:33.240 --> 19:34.435
Hit it.

19:35.440 --> 19:37.078
Next stop, Carnegie Hall!

19:39.560 --> 19:41.597
You know about Carnegie Hall?

19:42.680 --> 19:44.751
It's this big place
in New York City.

19:44.840 --> 19:48.117
All the great musicians
want to play Carnegie Hail.

19:48.560 --> 19:49.914
I did, too.

19:50.440 --> 19:53.273
When I was growing up,
it was my big ambition.

19:54.240 --> 19:57.710
But I never was
that good a musician.

20:02.320 --> 20:03.674
Are you okay?

20:05.680 --> 20:06.750
Yes..

20:06.840 --> 20:09.036
Good. What's your name?

20:13.280 --> 20:15.590
Okay, all right, all right.
Mr. No-Name.

20:16.120 --> 20:17.554
My name is Sam.

20:25.200 --> 20:26.679
Pleased to meet you.

20:28.600 --> 20:29.795
Me, too.

20:30.680 --> 20:32.398
Good. That's good.

20:34.000 --> 20:36.150
So, tell me something,
Mr. No-Name.

20:37.560 --> 20:40.154
I've been hearing
this sort of clicking sound.

20:40.240 --> 20:41.799
Do you hear it?

20:42.200 --> 20:43.838
Or is it just...

20:48.000 --> 20:49.229
(GRUNTING)

20:58.760 --> 21:01.832
I'm gonna sell you
is what I'm gonna do!

21:04.160 --> 21:07.357
If you can't do what I've trained you
to do, what fucking use are you?

21:07.440 --> 21:11.513
No fucking use is the answer.
No fucking use at all.

21:11.720 --> 21:13.916
I feed you. I clothe you!

21:14.040 --> 21:15.872
I put a roof over your head.

21:16.000 --> 21:19.516
And all that time I put in!
All the fucking effort

21:20.560 --> 21:23.154
to make you
the man that you are.

21:23.240 --> 21:25.800
And what gratitude
do I get? Look at me!

21:25.880 --> 21:29.191
I look as if I've just been through
the third fucking world war.

21:29.280 --> 21:31.635
Take him downstairs.
Get him out of my sight.

21:31.720 --> 21:33.996
Come on, doggy. Come on.

21:34.080 --> 21:35.878
I'm getting
too old for this shit.

21:36.920 --> 21:38.797
Go on then, Danny. Get in.

21:38.880 --> 21:40.075
Get in!
(COUGHS)

21:40.160 --> 21:42.959
I'm busy.
I said get in there.

21:43.040 --> 21:45.953
There's a man here to see you.
I just told you I'm busy.

21:46.040 --> 21:48.634
He says he's got
a business proposition for us.

21:48.720 --> 21:51.189
He says it's about
the show you put on today.

21:53.280 --> 21:55.237
Pat him down.
Already did.

21:57.160 --> 21:58.992
All right. Wheel him in.

22:01.000 --> 22:04.152
Fucking visitors, looking like this.
It's a joke.

22:06.720 --> 22:09.439
Shit! Jesus! Fucking he!!!

22:18.360 --> 22:19.634
Leave us.

22:21.920 --> 22:23.115
I'm listening.

22:24.400 --> 22:28.280
That was a very impressive display your
man put on in the jewelry shop today.

22:28.360 --> 22:30.636
I assure you,
it was entirely justified.

22:30.960 --> 22:32.359
I'm sure it was.

22:32.560 --> 22:34.756
That thing with the collar,
brilliant.

22:34.840 --> 22:36.877
And the point
of this conversation is?

22:37.000 --> 22:41.676
The point of this conversation is I'd like
to offer you a lucrative proposition.

22:41.760 --> 22:43.194
How lucrative?

22:43.280 --> 22:44.873
Very lucrative.

22:45.960 --> 22:47.109
Should I continue?

22:47.440 --> 22:48.510
Please.

22:51.800 --> 22:55.111
MAN CONTINUES: It's an entertainment I
produce for some friends once a month.

22:55.200 --> 22:56.998
Members only, so to speak.

22:57.160 --> 22:58.275
What?

22:58.360 --> 23:01.398
We're always on
the lookout for new talent.

23:01.480 --> 23:05.189
The first fight is a tryout.
For that you get 15, 000.

23:05.320 --> 23:07.914
For the second,
20 plus the right to bet.

23:08.000 --> 23:10.514
We had one chap who, after
fees and betting on himself

23:10.600 --> 23:12.637
got up to
half a million a fight.

23:12.720 --> 23:14.870
That's only if you win,
of course.

23:15.360 --> 23:17.431
BART: Well, how do you
get to win?

23:17.520 --> 23:19.352
MAN: it's to the death.

23:21.640 --> 23:23.472
So glad you could make it.

23:24.320 --> 23:25.993
Please, follow me.

23:28.160 --> 23:29.230
Where's the money?

23:29.320 --> 23:31.994
Oh, well,
the money comes after.

23:32.720 --> 23:33.869
After what?

23:33.960 --> 23:36.839
After you beat him,
our current champion.

Undefeated in 15 bouts.

24:25.920 --> 24:28.309
You're most welcome.
Very impressive.

24:28.400 --> 24:30.914
That bit with the collar,
how did you do that?

24:31.000 --> 24:32.957
Like my saint of a mum
used to say,

24:33.040 --> 24:35.600
"Get them young and the
possibilities are endless."

24:35.680 --> 24:37.591
I thought it was
the Jesuits who said that.

24:37.680 --> 24:39.751
Aye. Probably got it
from my mum.

24:40.720 --> 24:43.155
If you want us back,
you do know where to find me.

24:43.240 --> 24:45.629
Oh, we certainly
want you back.

24:45.720 --> 24:50.396
Only, if you could make it a little
more entertaining next time.

24:50.720 --> 24:52.552
I'll see what I can do.

25:10.240 --> 25:12.834
Here, remember I told you
about that dream I had?

25:12.920 --> 25:14.718
What? The one with all
the birds in it? Yeah.

25:14.800 --> 25:16.837
Yeah.
Well, I figured it all out.

25:16.920 --> 25:19.196
Do you know who Freud is?
No.

25:19.280 --> 25:22.079
Well, that don't matter.
Freud was a genius.

25:22.280 --> 25:26.035
And his whole thing was that if you dream
something, it means something else.

25:26.120 --> 25:27.269
Yeah.

25:27.280 --> 25:30.079
Like the girls, the island, the drink.
Yeah, right.

25:30.160 --> 25:31.514
They were just symbols.

25:31.600 --> 25:34.638
What they actually represented
was, like, comfort, relaxation,

doesn't it?

25:45.280 --> 25:48.159
The dream, the swell.
It means retirement.

25:48.240 --> 25:49.753
You get it?
Yeah.

25:50.960 --> 25:54.590
No more filthy collections.
No more beatings.

25:54.680 --> 25:59.151
Oh, I tell you,
I feel really good here.

25:59.640 --> 26:01.278
I feel generous.

26:01.520 --> 26:03.511

26:04.600 --> 26:06.955
A piano.
Excuse me?

26:08.080 --> 26:11.755
I want a piano.
A piano? Oh, yeah.

26:13.000 --> 26:14.991
How about a lobster dinner?

26:15.200 --> 26:16.634
I want a piano.

26:16.760 --> 26:19.320
How about a woman?
You've never had a woman.

26:19.400 --> 26:20.959
I want a piano.

26:21.480 --> 26:23.915
Danny, you're starting
to piss me off.

You've been very patient

you're still asleep.

29:25.000 --> 29:26.274
Well, now.

29:27.760 --> 29:30.593
If I was a fellow who woke up
in a strange house

29:30.680 --> 29:35.516
wearing someone else's pajamas,
I would be pretty nervous.

29:35.600 --> 29:39.275
I'd try to find the safest
place I could to hide.

29:41.200 --> 29:42.713
Now, when I was a kid,

29:42.840 --> 29:46.470
the safest place
in the whole wide world was

29:47.160 --> 29:48.753
right where you are.

29:49.920 --> 29:51.877
It does feel safe,
doesn't it?

29:52.120 --> 29:56.318

two days would wake up pretty hungry.

on asking questions.

told me those are the rules.

33:49.960 --> 33:52.634
Oh, you mean I didn't tell you
about the special exemption

33:52.720 --> 33:54.199
for very important
piano recitals?

33:54.280 --> 33:58.035
Oh, yeah, right.
Exemptions. I buy that. Not.

33:58.120 --> 34:01.511
You know, I liked it better when you
just agreed with everything I said.

34:01.640 --> 34:03.392
How about some soup?

34:05.920 --> 34:07.274
VICTORIA: (WHISPERING)
There you go.

34:07.640 --> 34:09.790
Well, you're just in time.

34:10.960 --> 34:12.678
This is your place.

34:14.760 --> 34:16.159
Come on, sit down.

34:23.280 --> 34:24.509
Okay?

34:24.600 --> 34:26.830
Victoria, would you...
Oh, sure.

34:30.000 --> 34:31.513
Sam made this.

34:31.639 --> 34:35.190
It's his world-famous
potato and leek soup.

34:35.280 --> 34:36.793
World-famous.

34:40.159 --> 34:41.958
There's your napkin.

34:43.239 --> 34:44.389
Bread?

35:02.120 --> 35:03.315
Um, no.

35:03.800 --> 35:05.279
This is a spoon.

35:05.360 --> 35:07.237
And this is your spoon.

35:09.720 --> 35:11.074
Like this.

35:28.800 --> 35:30.029
(SLURPING)

35:32.400 --> 35:33.549
Oh, my God.

35:33.960 --> 35:35.030
(BURPS)

35:35.760 --> 35:36.830
(BURPS)

35:37.000 --> 35:39.310
Oh, great. A duet.

35:52.520 --> 35:54.477
My name is Danny.

36:03.280 --> 36:06.830
I think we won't put a bandage back on
and we'll let some air get to this.

36:06.920 --> 36:08.991
You're gonna be just fine.

36:09.760 --> 36:11.797
I've been meaning to ask you.

36:13.320 --> 36:14.799
What is this?

36:15.320 --> 36:17.152
Okay. No problem.

36:17.800 --> 36:19.791
I wasn't gonna take it off.

36:20.880 --> 36:23.076
You know, when I was kid,
I had a cowboy hat.

36:24.640 --> 36:28.076
I slept in it, I ate in it,
I bathed in it.

36:28.560 --> 36:31.757
Anybody tried to take it off,
that same reaction. So...

36:33.320 --> 36:34.754
Anyway, I've been thinking.

36:34.840 --> 36:37.958
You've been cooped up in here
for weeks now.

36:38.640 --> 36:42.076
Wouldn't you like
to get some fresh air?

36:42.600 --> 36:43.954
Stretch your legs?

36:44.040 --> 36:45.474
It's nice outside.

36:46.640 --> 36:48.278
It's nice in here.

36:49.640 --> 36:53.190
You're afraid that if you go out
you won't be able to come back in?

36:54.120 --> 36:55.758
We'll come back.

36:56.200 --> 36:57.474
Promise.

37:00.800 --> 37:02.393
To tell you the truth, I...

37:03.720 --> 37:05.119
I could use a little help.

37:05.240 --> 37:06.389
With pianos?

37:06.480 --> 37:07.914
Walking Victoria to school.

37:13.640 --> 37:15.472
VICTORIA: Here
you got sidewalk.

37:19.920 --> 37:20.990
Okay.

37:21.080 --> 37:23.071
All right, we'll be back
to get you at 3:00.

37:23.160 --> 37:24.230
I am 18, Sam.

37:24.320 --> 37:26.357
Yeah, for a whole week-and-a-half.
3:00. All right.

37:26.440 --> 37:27.714
Bye
Bye. '

37:27.960 --> 37:28.995
Bye.

37:33.240 --> 37:34.310
You all right?

37:34.680 --> 37:35.795
She kissed me.

37:35.880 --> 37:38.633
Yeah, I know,
she does that. How was it?

37:40.240 --> 37:42.117
Wet.
But is that all?

37:43.520 --> 37:44.635
Nice.

37:44.720 --> 37:46.040
Wet. Nice.

37:47.000 --> 37:50.630
Sounds like what a kiss ought to feel like.
Come on, we got a lot to do.

37:57.480 --> 37:59.790
Hello, love.
Oh, good morning, Maddy.

38:00.640 --> 38:03.393
Maddy runs the best supermarket
in all of Glasgow.

38:03.520 --> 38:06.273
Maddy, this is Danny.
Hello, Danny.

38:07.200 --> 38:10.158
He's a little shy.
Oh, I like my men to be shy.

38:10.240 --> 38:12.311
Presents a challenge
for a girl.

38:13.560 --> 38:15.870
I'm just gonna give him some of
the finer points of shopping.

38:15.960 --> 38:17.359
Couldn't have
a better teacher.

38:17.480 --> 38:18.959
Isn't that so?

38:19.160 --> 38:21.959
My mother could take
two stones and a cup of water

38:22.040 --> 38:24.190
and make a three-course meal.

38:24.840 --> 38:28.196
As soon as I was old enough, she
gave me the secret of great cooking.

38:28.280 --> 38:30.157
And now I'm gonna
teach it to you.

38:30.240 --> 38:32.516
So, you ready to learn
the secret to great cooking?

38:32.600 --> 38:34.796
Yes.
Okay, here it is.

38:34.920 --> 38:37.673
Food talks.
Food talks?

38:38.440 --> 38:39.714
You didn't know that,
did you?

38:40.080 --> 38:41.115
No.

38:41.200 --> 38:42.520
Food talks.

38:42.600 --> 38:45.319
It will tell you
everything you need to know.

38:45.400 --> 38:47.994
All you have to do
is learn the language.

38:48.360 --> 38:50.476
Take this melon here
for instance now.

38:50.560 --> 38:51.709
(TAPPING)

38:52.400 --> 38:54.471
What do you think
that's saying?

38:55.400 --> 38:56.595
(PUFFS)

38:56.760 --> 38:57.989
laughs)

38:58.920 --> 39:02.231
Yeah. But it's also saying,
"I am ripe."

39:03.080 --> 39:05.356
You know what ripe
means, don't you? No.

39:05.440 --> 39:08.956
Ripe means sweet
and sweet means good.

39:10.680 --> 39:12.557
The kiss was ripe.

39:14.280 --> 39:15.509
Uh,no,no.

39:15.600 --> 39:18.399
The kiss was sweet.
The melon is ripe.

39:19.280 --> 39:21.556
But ripe means sweet.

39:22.720 --> 39:25.519
Well, when you're
talking about food.

39:25.600 --> 39:28.592
Kisses are nourishing in their
own way, but kisses are...

39:29.880 --> 39:31.200
Kisses are complicated.

39:31.280 --> 39:32.953
For now,
let's just stick to melons.

39:33.280 --> 39:35.237
(INHALING DEEPLY)

39:36.000 --> 39:39.789
Good bread is fresh.
Here, smell it. Fresh.

39:41.120 --> 39:43.031
Fresh.
Fresh.

39:43.120 --> 39:45.873
Good. All right.
Get some bread, Danny.

39:53.160 --> 39:57.950
Okay, now comes
the hard part. Cooking.

39:59.640 --> 40:02.951
Over there in that cabinet,
there's a large, round pot.

40:03.040 --> 40:05.680
Would you get it for me? Okay.

40:09.280 --> 40:11.749
Now, when we
cook the food,

40:11.840 --> 40:13.990
it speaks to us
in another language,

40:14.080 --> 40:16.799
which we listen to with
our tongues, by tasting.

40:17.600 --> 40:18.920
Look at these beauties.

40:20.600 --> 40:21.829
Yeah.

40:23.640 --> 40:26.632
Now, you know you've got good sausage
when they're attached like this.

40:30.680 --> 40:31.795
Hmm.

40:33.000 --> 40:36.197
Found something, didn't you?
Now, let's see...

40:39.840 --> 40:42.719
That's Victoria when
she was a little baby.

40:44.320 --> 40:48.075
And that's Victoria
with her mom.

40:50.080 --> 40:51.878
Her father
was my best friend.

40:51.960 --> 40:54.236
He died before
Victoria was born.

40:58.600 --> 41:01.035
Her mother was
my best friend, also.

41:02.640 --> 41:03.630
So,

41:05.360 --> 41:08.557
after he died,
she and I got married.

41:10.640 --> 41:12.119
Then, there was
a car accident

41:12.200 --> 41:15.192
when Victoria was
seven years old.

41:15.280 --> 41:17.840
Her mother was killed,
and I lost my eyesight.

41:19.240 --> 41:21.470
Victoria was left with me.

41:22.800 --> 41:24.871
Funny how families
get made, isn't it?

41:28.080 --> 41:29.559
You got family?

41:29.640 --> 41:30.994
Don't know.

41:31.360 --> 41:34.273
Well, you must have.
Everybody's got family somewhere.

41:36.000 --> 41:37.559
I don't remember them.

41:39.680 --> 41:42.513
Well, maybe
you will one day.

41:45.560 --> 41:47.198
The pots are in there.

41:57.040 --> 41:58.917
Earth to Danny.

41:59.000 --> 42:01.469
Sam sent me.
All by yourself?

42:01.560 --> 42:04.279
Wow, big day!
We should celebrate.

42:04.360 --> 42:05.839
What's that?

42:05.960 --> 42:08.839
"Celebrate"? It means we
should do something special.

42:08.960 --> 42:10.678
Sam said right home.

42:11.960 --> 42:13.109
Come on.

42:16.440 --> 42:19.353
Here. Thank you. Come on.

42:19.440 --> 42:22.319
This is the cone
and this is the ice cream.

42:23.560 --> 42:25.790
You ever
have ice cream before?

42:25.880 --> 42:28.474
No. Well, this is
vanilla ice cream.

42:28.760 --> 42:30.273
Vanilla's white.

42:30.920 --> 42:33.480
Vanilla is white.
Go on, taste it.

42:43.640 --> 42:46.632
Oh, no.
Just work it around.

42:49.440 --> 42:50.430
(SWALLOWS)

42:50.520 --> 42:51.999
Oh, my God!

42:52.080 --> 42:56.153
You know the thing about ice cream is
first it's cold, but then it's sweet.

42:56.240 --> 43:00.871
And if you freeze your mouth out, you're
never gonna be able to taste the sweet part.

43:01.360 --> 43:03.237
So look,
here's how you do it. You...

43:03.320 --> 43:05.311
Sweet is good.
Yeah, right.

43:05.680 --> 43:07.193
So look, you lick

43:08.960 --> 43:10.280
like that.

43:13.000 --> 43:14.479
There you go.

43:17.080 --> 43:18.309
How's that?

43:24.520 --> 43:26.352
Look.
You're getting it everywhere.

43:28.200 --> 43:30.589
Shit. Actually,
we should really hurry.

43:30.680 --> 43:32.000
Come on.

43:33.240 --> 43:34.514
You okay?

43:35.960 --> 43:37.359
Finish it quickly.

43:37.440 --> 43:40.990
And remember, if Sam asks where we
were, you let me do the talking.

43:41.080 --> 43:44.630
If he knows we had ice cream before dinner,
he'll be pissed we ruined our appetite.

43:44.720 --> 43:46.074
Understand?

43:46.160 --> 43:47.753
What's appetite?

43:47.840 --> 43:50.514
Appetite's what you have if you don't
have a belly full of ice cream.

43:50.600 --> 43:51.829
How's my mouth?

43:52.560 --> 43:54.756
Nice.
No, it's not.

43:55.040 --> 43:58.271
It's full of hardware,
but not for much longer.

43:58.760 --> 44:00.558
Do you miss your mom?

44:02.040 --> 44:03.394
Every day.

44:03.960 --> 44:05.553
You miss your mom?

44:06.240 --> 44:08.197
I don't remember my mom.

44:08.680 --> 44:11.798
Sometimes I think it'd be
easier not to remember.

44:16.320 --> 44:17.390
Hi.

44:17.600 --> 44:18.635
Hi.

44:18.720 --> 44:19.869
You're late.

44:19.960 --> 44:23.715
It was so nice out we decided
to walk the long way.

44:23.800 --> 44:25.393
Oh, you...

44:26.400 --> 44:28.994
Didn't I say bring her
straight home?

44:29.120 --> 44:31.589
Sam, it was me, not him.

44:31.680 --> 44:32.909
Oh, it was...

44:33.120 --> 44:35.077
If you wanted to take
the long way home, Victoria,

44:35.160 --> 44:36.559
you could have gone
to that school in Kansas.

44:36.640 --> 44:38.631
Then you could have taken
the long way home for 50 miles

44:38.720 --> 44:40.518
and I wouldn't care!
50 miles of corn.

44:40.600 --> 44:42.398
Corn is safe.
Corn is boring.

44:42.480 --> 44:44.073
And anyway,
this was the better school.

44:44.240 --> 44:47.790
Which is why we're here
and not with the corn, right?

44:47.880 --> 44:49.518
So do me a favor.

44:49.960 --> 44:51.189
Don't make me worry.

44:51.440 --> 44:52.430
Okay, Sam.

44:52.600 --> 44:53.795
Au right.

44:55.280 --> 44:56.270
(SNIFFING)

44:56.360 --> 44:57.759
What is that?

44:57.920 --> 45:00.036
What?
It smells like ice cream.

45:00.720 --> 45:02.950
Vanilla ice cream.
Vanilla is white.

45:04.000 --> 45:06.640
First is cold, then is sweet.

45:07.800 --> 45:09.234
Sweet is good.

45:09.320 --> 45:10.310
(MOUTHING)

45:14.080 --> 45:15.354
(PLAYING ELECTRONIC KEYBOARD)

45:26.640 --> 45:27.835
Victoria?

45:28.480 --> 45:29.629
Yeah?

45:32.280 --> 45:34.430
Sometimes I worry
about that boy.

45:35.200 --> 45:37.032
It's as if
something or someone

45:37.120 --> 45:39.077
has made him shut down
his feelings so hard,

45:39.160 --> 45:41.390
he can no longer
get in touch with them.

45:41.480 --> 45:44.040
That's what I've been trying
to get him to do.

45:45.800 --> 45:47.677
With vanilla ice cream?

45:48.360 --> 45:51.671
Maybe we should come up with
some different strategies.

45:53.160 --> 45:54.912
Good night.
Night.

46:09.800 --> 46:10.915
Come on.

46:19.200 --> 46:22.431
When I was little, I used to
do this with my mom and Sam.

46:22.520 --> 46:25.160
It's kind of how
I fell in love with music.

46:25.240 --> 46:27.038
See these thingies?

46:27.120 --> 46:28.713
They're called notes.

46:29.320 --> 46:31.118
Notes.
Okay.

46:32.040 --> 46:33.713
Notes are signals.

46:34.360 --> 46:36.476
Notes are signals.
Okay.

46:36.560 --> 46:38.198
Notes are signals.

46:38.320 --> 46:41.199
So if you see this note,

46:41.280 --> 46:43.476
it's the signal
to play this key.

46:45.880 --> 46:49.236
And this one this key.

46:50.040 --> 46:53.396
And this one this key.

46:55.880 --> 46:59.635
Right? So you're gonna play,
and you're gonna hop.

47:09.600 --> 47:10.954
Great!

47:11.040 --> 47:12.189
Ready?

47:13.280 --> 47:14.793
I'm gonna go.

47:14.880 --> 47:16.757
(PLAYING HABANERA FROM CARMEN)

47:22.640 --> 47:24.472
Keep going. Don't stop.

47:55.440 --> 47:56.874
It's not ripe.

47:56.960 --> 47:58.837
Hello, Sam.
Hi, Maddy.

47:58.960 --> 48:01.520
How's the lessons going?
On, he’s growing by leaps and bounds.

48:01.600 --> 48:03.637
What is this you got here?

48:03.720 --> 48:05.552
Too ripe.

48:05.640 --> 48:07.199
MAN: I'm gonna fuck you,
you fucking tosser.

48:07.320 --> 48:08.993
Where the fuck
do you think you're going?

48:12.480 --> 48:14.471
Alex, go around
the other side. Quick.

48:15.880 --> 48:17.598
There he is! Get him.

48:37.040 --> 48:38.553
This one's ripe.

48:41.840 --> 48:44.195
Danny, do you remember
when I said

48:44.280 --> 48:47.159
that Victoria and I were not
big on asking questions?

48:47.240 --> 48:50.278
That we thought when people were ready,
they'd give their own answers?

48:50.360 --> 48:51.350
I remember.

48:51.440 --> 48:53.590
Well, after today
in the supermarket,

48:55.000 --> 48:57.310
I need some answers and I don't
think I'm gonna get them

48:57.400 --> 48:58.834
without asking the questions.

48:58.920 --> 49:00.069
Is that all right?

49:00.160 --> 49:01.150
Okay.

49:01.240 --> 49:02.799
Okay, so,

49:04.320 --> 49:06.630
in the market, those men,
they were fighting.

49:06.720 --> 49:08.836
You knew that, right?
Yes.

49:08.920 --> 49:11.036
But that didn't bother you?
No.

49:11.120 --> 49:12.872
You weren't afraid?
No.

49:12.960 --> 49:16.351
Normally, people find themselves
in situations like that,

49:16.440 --> 49:18.431
they get afraid.

49:18.520 --> 49:20.272
They weren't fighting me.

49:21.200 --> 49:23.157
Okay, one more question.

49:24.920 --> 49:28.390
When you first came to us,
you were hurt pretty bad.

49:29.040 --> 49:30.314
How did that happen?

49:30.640 --> 49:32.313
I ask for a piano.

49:33.920 --> 49:36.070
You asked who for a piano?
My uncle.

49:36.200 --> 49:38.157
Oh. Oh, you do have family?

49:38.440 --> 49:39.635
No.

49:39.720 --> 49:41.711
But you just said
you had an uncle.

49:41.800 --> 49:43.029
He's dead.

49:45.960 --> 49:47.030
Oh.

49:48.080 --> 49:49.229

like it belongs there.

you just played.

52:01.800 --> 52:03.518
It's what I hear in my head.

52:04.160 --> 52:05.355
Do it again.

52:12.600 --> 52:15.433
It's hard. Someone had
to teach it to you.

where I grew up, in New York City?

could attend school.

01:28:06.680 --> 01:28:08.398
Just move. Just move back.

01:28:11.120 --> 01:28:12.519
(GRUNTING)

01:28:21.360 --> 01:28:22.998
(FAINT THUMPING)

01:28:27.040 --> 01:28:28.951
Clever little bastard.

01:28:31.440 --> 01:28:34.034
Wait here.
All of you, wait here.

01:28:35.560 --> 01:28:37.153
BART: Danny!

01:28:40.240 --> 01:28:41.389
Danny!

01:28:42.160 --> 01:28:43.878
Danny, where are you?

01:28:54.080 --> 01:28:55.400
Bastards.

01:28:58.440 --> 01:28:59.760
Pajamas?

01:29:02.520 --> 01:29:03.919
Fucking pajamas?

01:29:06.080 --> 01:29:09.516
You ungrateful little bastard!
Where are you?

01:29:18.360 --> 01:29:21.079
You gave up
our good life for this?

01:29:22.400 --> 01:29:25.950
This is it? This is your refuge?
Your home away from home?

01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:28.798
This is your place of...

01:29:30.760 --> 01:29:32.159
awakening?

01:29:32.800 --> 01:29:34.029
Art.

01:29:34.720 --> 01:29:35.869
Books.

01:29:38.080 --> 01:29:39.275
Music?

01:29:41.440 --> 01:29:42.714
For what?

01:29:44.280 --> 01:29:46.669
Did it make you
a better person?

01:29:46.880 --> 01:29:48.871
Look what you made of it.

01:29:49.360 --> 01:29:51.317
Nice people took you in.

01:29:51.400 --> 01:29:53.437
They give you everything,

01:29:53.920 --> 01:29:55.877
and look how you repay them.

01:29:57.040 --> 01:29:59.270
You destroyed their lives,

01:29:59.760 --> 01:30:02.149
like you'll destroy any life.

01:30:02.600 --> 01:30:06.389
That's because you're not meant
for this kind of life, Danny.

01:30:06.560 --> 01:30:08.073
You're a dog.

01:30:08.280 --> 01:30:09.759
You're my dog.

01:30:10.160 --> 01:30:13.630
I fed you, I trained you,
I own you.

01:30:13.920 --> 01:30:15.274
And I should kill you,

01:30:15.360 --> 01:30:19.877
like any responsible owner would do
to a dog that caused this much pain,

01:30:21.680 --> 01:30:23.512
this much suffering.

01:30:27.840 --> 01:30:28.989
(SCOFFS)

01:30:32.480 --> 01:30:33.515
But...

01:30:39.800 --> 01:30:41.074
I can't.

01:30:48.120 --> 01:30:49.713
Come home, Danny.

01:30:50.680 --> 01:30:52.239
All's forgiven.

01:30:54.040 --> 01:30:55.553
You'll be safe.

01:30:56.960 --> 01:30:59.873
You'll be back in a world
that you understand.

01:31:01.520 --> 01:31:03.750
The only world
you'll ever understand.

01:31:06.160 --> 01:31:07.719
What do you say?

01:31:09.640 --> 01:31:11.392
Forgive and forget?

01:31:15.080 --> 01:31:18.436
I know just how confusing
the world can get.

01:31:21.720 --> 01:31:23.677
We'll make it simple again.

01:31:24.480 --> 01:31:26.073
You, me.

01:31:27.960 --> 01:31:29.439
Our cozy little life.

01:31:30.400 --> 01:31:32.710
Come on, Danny. Come on.

01:31:33.240 --> 01:31:37.074
Come on. Yes, that's my boy.

01:31:38.200 --> 01:31:40.191
Yes. Come on.

01:31:41.400 --> 01:31:42.959
Come on.

01:31:43.240 --> 01:31:44.594
Come on.

01:31:45.280 --> 01:31:47.032
Welcome home, Danny.

01:31:49.200 --> 01:31:50.599
I am home.

01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:53.070
No!

01:31:53.160 --> 01:31:54.150
(SHOT FIRED)

01:31:54.240 --> 01:31:55.230
(BONE CRACKING)

01:31:59.280 --> 01:32:00.634
(PANTING)

01:32:09.160 --> 01:32:11.197
No! Danny, don't!

01:32:11.280 --> 01:32:13.999
He's gonna kill him!
Don't, Danny. Danny, don't!

01:32:14.840 --> 01:32:17.309
Don't do this, Danny. Don't.
He killed my mother!

01:32:17.400 --> 01:32:19.596
It won't bring her back,
and you'll be just like him.

01:32:19.720 --> 01:32:22.155
He is me! We're both animals.

01:32:23.200 --> 01:32:24.873
Fucking dog!
No, you're not an animal.

01:32:24.960 --> 01:32:28.430
If you kill him, Danny, everything you've
done to make yourself happy will be lost.

01:32:28.560 --> 01:32:29.789
Don't listen to this crap.

01:32:29.880 --> 01:32:32.713
They will lock you in a cage forever.
We are animals.

01:32:32.800 --> 01:32:35.235
No, Danny. No.
Kill me!

01:32:35.360 --> 01:32:37.556
No, Danny. You know why
he wants you to kill him?

01:32:37.640 --> 01:32:40.553
Danny, listen to me. Listen.

01:32:40.640 --> 01:32:42.472
Remember your mother?

01:32:42.960 --> 01:32:44.792
You remember
what I did to her?

01:32:45.360 --> 01:32:47.237
I screwed her every day.

01:32:48.320 --> 01:32:51.392
I mounted her
like the bitch she was!

01:32:51.480 --> 01:32:52.515
(ROARS)

01:32:52.600 --> 01:32:53.715
Don't!

01:32:57.320 --> 01:33:00.836
Yeah. You'll never
be anything but a dog.

01:33:01.320 --> 01:33:03.516
You'll never escape
what you are.

01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:06.310
You'll never escape
what I made you.

01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:11.118
A killer, that's what you are.

01:33:11.280 --> 01:33:13.351
And that's what
you'll always be.

01:33:13.480 --> 01:33:15.153
Now, be a good dog.

01:33:15.560 --> 01:33:17.597
Kill me. Get it over with.

01:33:18.080 --> 01:33:20.356
Come on! Kill me!

01:33:23.200 --> 01:33:24.793
Shut the hell up.

01:33:29.200 --> 01:33:31.669
That man could talk
some serious shit.

01:33:56.720 --> 01:33:59.633
You all right with that thing
around your neck?

01:33:59.720 --> 01:34:01.074
Is it okay?

01:34:03.360 --> 01:34:06.159
Well, I'd have to say
it was a decided improvement.

01:34:06.240 --> 01:34:07.435
ANNOUNCER:
Ladies and gentlemen,

01:34:07.520 --> 01:34:09.193
the recipient
of the 200th awarding

01:34:09.280 --> 01:34:13.558
of the scholarship for excellence
in piano, Miss Victoria Mills.

01:34:13.720 --> 01:34:15.074
(CROWD APPLAUDING)

01:34:23.320 --> 01:34:27.314
My selection tonight is
dedicated to someone wonderful.

01:34:27.720 --> 01:34:30.838
That's you. Oh, no, no.
it's not me she's talking about.

01:34:30.920 --> 01:34:34.754
Someone whose life was quite
literally saved by music.

01:34:36.440 --> 01:34:38.158
That's you, my boy.

01:34:49.120 --> 01:34:50.633
