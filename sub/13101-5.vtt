00:05.167 --> 00:06.542
(John)
Captain's personal log.

00:08.208 --> 00:09.750
We're almost ready to strike.

00:12.000 --> 00:15.667
The next few days will either
mark the beginning of a new age

00:15.750 --> 00:17.833
or the death of everything
we've worked for.

00:19.833 --> 00:21.667
[instrumental music]

00:23.708 --> 00:26.208
We just got a report from a ship
passing through Sector 900

00:26.292 --> 00:28.792
on the edge of Vorlon space.

00:28.875 --> 00:30.958
I suppose it was inevitable
with the Vorlons attacking

00:31.042 --> 00:32.167
Shadow bases all over the place

00:32.250 --> 00:33.417
and wiping out whole colonies

00:33.500 --> 00:35.333
where Shadows have influence.

00:35.417 --> 00:37.333
They were bound to strike back.

00:37.417 --> 00:40.375
It's like two giants
fighting in a sandbox.

00:40.458 --> 00:42.792
They don't even care who's
getting stepped on anymore.

00:42.875 --> 00:43.792
How bad is it?

00:43.875 --> 00:46.250
Oh, see for yourself.

00:46.333 --> 00:48.875
'This used to be a colony that
was supporting the Vorlons.'

00:50.333 --> 00:52.583
- What is that?
- 'Unknown.'

00:52.667 --> 00:54.167
At first we thought maybe
it was a dust cloud

00:54.250 --> 00:56.417
figured they were being bombed
from space.

00:56.500 --> 00:57.875
Then it began moving.

00:57.958 --> 01:00.417
'Before that cloud got there,
whatever it is..'

01:00.500 --> 01:03.458
...there were two million
sentients living on that planet.

01:03.542 --> 01:04.917
They're all dead now.

01:06.375 --> 01:08.250
You know, I used to think
that the Vorlon

01:08.333 --> 01:09.417
planet killers were scary.

01:09.500 --> 01:11.417
But now..

01:11.500 --> 01:13.917
...I don't even know
what I'm looking at.

01:14.000 --> 01:16.458
We couldn't get a reading on it.

01:16.542 --> 01:18.333
(John)
'Giants in the playground.'

01:19.708 --> 01:21.667
[intense music]

01:25.250 --> 01:27.583
(Londo)
'You all know why we are here.'

01:27.667 --> 01:29.500
What happens
in the next little while

01:29.583 --> 01:32.375
will determine the fate
of Centauri Prime.

01:32.458 --> 01:34.875
Homeworld will stand or fall

01:34.958 --> 01:38.042
depending on what we do here
in the next 17 hours.

01:38.125 --> 01:40.042
Mollari, we shouldn't
move hastily.

01:40.125 --> 01:41.583
No, we shouldn't.

01:41.667 --> 01:44.292
Unfortunately, we have
no other choice.

01:44.375 --> 01:47.125
No one in the royal court
was willing to stand up

01:47.208 --> 01:48.500
and prevent a madman

01:48.583 --> 01:50.833
from taking the throne
until it was too late.

01:50.917 --> 01:52.583
Don't blame us
for this, Mollari.

01:52.667 --> 01:55.000
Prime Minister Malachi
could've stopped him..

01:55.083 --> 01:59.000
...but Malachi is dead,
thanks to your friend Lord Refa.

01:59.083 --> 02:00.667
You were part of it all along.

02:00.750 --> 02:03.417
Refa never told me
his plans for Malachi

02:03.500 --> 02:05.667
and he has paid the price
for his actions.

02:05.750 --> 02:07.333
I made sure of that.

02:07.417 --> 02:09.500
Still, when I die

02:09.583 --> 02:12.708
there will be a reckoning,
but it will have to wait.

02:12.792 --> 02:15.542
What matters is what we do now!

02:15.625 --> 02:17.500
There has to be another way.

02:17.583 --> 02:19.042
I wish there was.

02:19.125 --> 02:21.708
But with the Shadows' vessels
based on Centauri Prime

02:21.792 --> 02:24.750
and the Vorlons coming,
we don't have any time.

02:24.833 --> 02:27.292
We must get their ships
off of the Homeworld

02:27.375 --> 02:29.083
before the Vorlons arrive.

02:29.167 --> 02:33.208
(Londo)
'And they will not leave
as long as Cartagia is alive'

02:33.292 --> 02:37.208
which is why
I have lured him here.

02:37.292 --> 02:39.583
Away from the royal court,
he is vulnerable.

02:39.667 --> 02:42.833
- Londo--
- There is no choice!

02:42.917 --> 02:46.500
By the end of this day,
either Cartagia is dead

02:46.583 --> 02:49.625
or Centauri Prime
will be destroyed.

02:52.167 --> 02:53.667
[instrumental music]

02:54.917 --> 02:57.042
(Lennier)
It was the year of fire.

02:57.125 --> 02:58.917
(Zack)
The year of destruction.

02:59.000 --> 03:01.625
(G'Kar)
The year we took back
what was ours.

03:01.708 --> 03:03.583
(Lyta)
It was the year of rebirth.

03:03.667 --> 03:05.875
(Vir)
The year of great sadness.

03:05.958 --> 03:07.500
(Marcus)
The year of pain.

03:07.583 --> 03:09.250
(Delenn)
And the year of joy.

03:09.333 --> 03:10.708
(Londo)
It was a new age.

03:10.792 --> 03:12.750
(Franklin)
It was the end of history.

03:12.833 --> 03:15.625
(Susan)
It was the year
everything changed.

03:18.333 --> 03:21.042
(Michael)
The year is 2261.

03:21.125 --> 03:24.000
(John)
The place, "Babylon 5."

03:24.083 --> 03:26.125
[theme music]

03:48.875 --> 03:50.958
[music continues]

04:21.125 --> 04:22.750
[instrumental music]

04:28.000 --> 04:29.542
You're far away again.

04:31.708 --> 04:32.750
Yeah.

04:34.000 --> 04:35.083
Sit.

04:40.375 --> 04:41.542
How is it out there?

04:41.625 --> 04:43.875
Oh, we just had ten more ships
join the fleet.

04:43.958 --> 04:45.542
It's the biggest thing
I've ever seen.

04:45.625 --> 04:47.625
Hell, no one's ever seen
a thing like this before.

04:47.708 --> 04:48.833
Mm.

04:48.917 --> 04:50.125
When you consider
that six months ago

04:50.208 --> 04:51.375
half of them
were fighting each other

04:51.458 --> 04:53.708
it's...it's amazing.

04:53.792 --> 04:55.375
And you brought them together.

04:55.458 --> 04:57.458
- You should be proud.
- Yeah.

04:59.750 --> 05:03.042
You know, all my life, I have
dreamed of going into battle

05:03.125 --> 05:04.833
commanding a fleet like this.

05:06.000 --> 05:08.167
Now we're gonna do it.

05:08.250 --> 05:10.417
No matter how it ends up,
we're gonna go down fighting.

05:12.417 --> 05:14.708
Susan..

05:14.792 --> 05:16.583
...that's what
I was thinking about.

05:18.125 --> 05:19.958
I don't want you with the fleet

05:20.042 --> 05:21.125
'at least not at first.'

05:21.208 --> 05:23.333
- Don't you dare.
- Susan--

05:23.417 --> 05:25.000
There's no way in hell
you're leaving me behind!

05:25.083 --> 05:26.208
Not this time.

05:26.292 --> 05:29.042
I'm not asking you
to stay behind.

05:29.125 --> 05:30.833
But there's something
I need you to do.

05:32.458 --> 05:34.125
You were looking for more
of the First Ones

05:34.208 --> 05:36.583
when you found the Vorlon fleet.

05:36.667 --> 05:39.375
'I need you to finish
what you started.'

05:39.458 --> 05:41.458
John, we looked everywhere
and came up empty.

05:41.542 --> 05:43.333
I mean, maybe there just
aren't anymore left.

05:43.417 --> 05:45.083
Lorien says there are.

05:45.167 --> 05:47.958
He can help you find them.

05:48.042 --> 05:50.500
Look, we need every resource
we can get.

05:50.583 --> 05:52.792
If we can have some
of the First Ones on board

05:52.875 --> 05:55.042
we have a chance.

05:55.125 --> 05:57.417
If not..

05:57.500 --> 05:59.417
It's funny, you know? This
morning, I remembered a story

05:59.500 --> 06:02.542
that I hadn't thought about
in years.

06:02.625 --> 06:04.208
I was ten.

06:04.292 --> 06:05.375
My father was away on business

06:05.458 --> 06:07.708
and my mother was..

06:07.792 --> 06:10.458
She'd been in the sleepers
for so many years.

06:10.542 --> 06:12.792
The damned Psi Corps control
freaks wouldn't leave her alone.

06:12.875 --> 06:15.750
You know, it's the same refrain
over and over again.

06:15.833 --> 06:17.917
"Sleepers or prison.
Sleepers or prison."

06:19.708 --> 06:22.000
I was downstairs.
I was playing with my dolls.

06:22.917 --> 06:24.458
I know. It's hard to believe.

06:24.542 --> 06:26.875
But even I played with dolls
once upon a time.

06:28.375 --> 06:30.708
Seems like a lifetime ago.

06:30.792 --> 06:32.167
Anyway..

06:32.250 --> 06:34.833
...she came downstairs
and she just..

06:34.917 --> 06:37.792
...watched me play.

06:37.875 --> 06:38.917
She had the strangest look
on her face

06:39.000 --> 06:40.458
like she was trying to burn

06:40.542 --> 06:41.708
that moment into her mind

06:41.792 --> 06:44.083
so she would never,
ever forget it.

06:44.167 --> 06:45.583
And so I asked her
if she'd play with me

06:45.667 --> 06:48.500
and she said, uh, "Of course,
Susatchka, but..

06:48.583 --> 06:50.250
"...I want you to wait

06:50.333 --> 06:52.917
"for me next door
at Cousin Magda's house.

06:53.875 --> 06:55.292
I'll come for you soon."

06:56.583 --> 06:58.375
And so I went..

06:58.458 --> 07:01.333
...and I waited, and I waited

07:01.417 --> 07:03.125
and it got dark,
and my father came home

07:03.208 --> 07:05.167
and then some other men
showed up.

07:05.250 --> 07:08.417
And then my father told me
that my mother had gone away.

07:10.250 --> 07:11.667
It wasn't until later
that I found out

07:11.750 --> 07:14.125
that she took her own life.

07:14.208 --> 07:16.458
That she had come down
to watch me play

07:16.542 --> 07:19.500
so that she could have one
perfect memory..

07:19.583 --> 07:21.417
...to take with her into heaven.

07:24.250 --> 07:25.500
Whenever someone has told me

07:25.583 --> 07:27.667
that they would wait for me..

07:27.750 --> 07:30.000
...or come for me..

07:30.083 --> 07:31.542
...it hasn't come true.

07:33.458 --> 07:35.083
I can't do that anymore, John.

07:36.750 --> 07:38.333
Not unless I'm sure.

07:39.875 --> 07:42.167
What do you want me to do?

07:42.250 --> 07:44.542
I want you to make me
a promise..

07:44.625 --> 07:47.583
...not as my friend,
not as my commanding officer..

07:47.667 --> 07:49.375
...from one soldier to another.

07:49.458 --> 07:51.417
Don't protect me.

07:51.500 --> 07:53.792
Don't hold me back.

07:53.875 --> 07:54.917
I want you to promise me

07:55.000 --> 07:55.958
that I will be there

07:56.042 --> 07:58.708
with the fleet at the end.

07:58.792 --> 08:00.375
No matter what happens.

08:01.458 --> 08:03.333
[dramatic music]

08:03.417 --> 08:06.417
I have just enough trust
left in me to believe you.

08:08.042 --> 08:09.708
[chuckles]

08:09.792 --> 08:11.417
You'll be there.

08:15.292 --> 08:17.458
When do you want me to leave?

08:17.542 --> 08:18.667
As soon as possible.

08:18.750 --> 08:20.583
Lorien's already been notified.

08:23.250 --> 08:24.500
Susan.

08:28.708 --> 08:31.708
Uh..

08:31.792 --> 08:35.583
...I don't think I,
I ever told you

08:35.667 --> 08:37.500
what a good friend you've been.

08:38.708 --> 08:40.875
'And how proud I am of you.'

08:40.958 --> 08:43.000
[music continues]

08:44.583 --> 08:46.292
I just, uh..

08:46.375 --> 08:49.458
Well, before you left, I-I..

08:49.542 --> 08:51.208
...I just thought
you should know.

08:53.667 --> 08:54.958
Thank you.

08:56.250 --> 08:57.500
Goodnight, captain.

08:57.583 --> 08:59.083
Goodnight, commander.

09:00.708 --> 09:01.833
[music continues]

09:07.167 --> 09:09.292
[all laughing]

09:13.500 --> 09:14.583
[squeaking]

09:20.042 --> 09:21.625
Mollari! Mollari, here.

09:21.708 --> 09:24.000
Come away from the window.
You're missing all the fun.

09:24.083 --> 09:25.500
There was too much fun, majesty.

09:25.583 --> 09:27.167
- I, I needed a break.
- 'Uh.'

09:27.250 --> 09:30.083
Isn't it amazing
what they've done here?

09:30.167 --> 09:31.917
It's almost identical

09:32.000 --> 09:33.583
to the throne room back home.

09:33.667 --> 09:35.042
Mm.

09:35.125 --> 09:37.000
Mollari.

09:37.083 --> 09:39.625
I wanted you to know..

09:39.708 --> 09:42.792
...I have decided
to take you with me.

09:42.875 --> 09:43.708
Majesty?

09:43.792 --> 09:45.167
A God must have a high priest

09:45.250 --> 09:46.125
must he not?

09:46.208 --> 09:47.500
And when the Shadows rise

09:47.583 --> 09:49.042
from the ashes of Centauri Prime

09:49.125 --> 09:50.500
and reward my loyalty
with Godhood

09:50.583 --> 09:53.458
I want you to be the first one
in my temple.

09:53.542 --> 09:55.250
I haven't decided
where to build it yet, but--

09:55.333 --> 09:57.167
Then you will not be
on Centauri Prime

09:57.250 --> 09:58.750
when the Vorlons come?

09:58.833 --> 10:03.958
Of course not. You and I
will watch from a distance.

10:04.042 --> 10:07.000
We'll head back as soon as we've
finished with G'Kar's execution

10:07.083 --> 10:08.083
and then..

10:08.167 --> 10:09.625
Phoo!

10:20.333 --> 10:22.375
[all laughing]

10:24.708 --> 10:25.833
You see?

10:27.542 --> 10:29.875
Phoo! Phoo!

10:29.958 --> 10:31.500
[humming]

10:34.333 --> 10:36.208
You'll excuse me, majesty.

10:37.583 --> 10:40.458
But I have to go and check
on some arrangements.

10:55.250 --> 10:56.833
G'Kar.

11:03.958 --> 11:05.542
Great maker.

11:08.292 --> 11:09.708
Your eye.

11:11.667 --> 11:13.583
Cartagia?

11:15.833 --> 11:19.125
My eye offended him.

11:21.292 --> 11:22.917
Doesn't matter.

11:24.167 --> 11:27.250
I can see things now..

11:27.333 --> 11:30.708
...that were invisible
to me before.

11:30.792 --> 11:33.125
An empty eye..

11:33.208 --> 11:36.167
...sees through
to an empty heart.

11:36.250 --> 11:39.833
Your execution has been set
for later today.

11:41.042 --> 11:44.000
Cartagia will parade you
before your people

11:44.083 --> 11:46.333
humiliate you.

11:46.417 --> 11:50.292
Use you to strip away
their last hope.

11:50.375 --> 11:51.458
And then..

11:53.000 --> 11:54.958
'...then he will kill you.'

11:59.875 --> 12:01.958
At least that is the plan.

12:03.375 --> 12:06.042
My people are in place.

12:06.125 --> 12:08.500
Your chains have been weakened

12:08.583 --> 12:10.375
the palace guards bribed.

12:12.083 --> 12:15.375
His personal guards
cannot be bribed.

12:15.458 --> 12:17.833
That is where you come in.

12:17.917 --> 12:21.375
'You need only to distract them
for a few moments.'

12:22.875 --> 12:25.542
We will take care
of things from there.

12:27.708 --> 12:29.000
Can you do it?

12:31.500 --> 12:33.708
Your heart is empty, Mollari.

12:35.125 --> 12:36.625
Did you know that?

12:37.917 --> 12:39.667
I know..

12:39.750 --> 12:43.917
...that your heart
will be dead soon..

12:44.000 --> 12:46.708
...if you do not act
as I have instructed you.

12:48.625 --> 12:50.875
'G'Kar, remember..'

12:52.125 --> 12:54.708
...do not harm him.

12:54.792 --> 12:58.125
If you touch him,
your people will suffer..

12:59.417 --> 13:01.083
'...and never be set free.'

13:02.750 --> 13:05.042
Leave him to us.

13:06.792 --> 13:08.833
[dramatic music]

13:16.833 --> 13:18.208
[knocks on door]

13:22.000 --> 13:23.333
[man screaming]

13:30.458 --> 13:32.250
[intense music]

13:37.458 --> 13:40.292
Humor is such
a subjective thing.

13:41.167 --> 13:42.667
'Don't you think, Mollari?'

13:47.625 --> 13:49.333
[music continues]

13:56.333 --> 13:57.333
[knocks on door]

13:57.417 --> 13:58.625
Yes?

14:02.333 --> 14:04.083
You have it?

14:04.167 --> 14:05.792
Good. There wasn't a problem?

14:05.875 --> 14:07.417
You weren't seen?

14:07.500 --> 14:08.917
I don't think so.

14:09.000 --> 14:11.375
Uh, I kept checking,
but as far as I could tell

14:11.458 --> 14:13.167
nobody was even trying
to follow me.

14:13.250 --> 14:15.875
Mm-mm, that is why I sent you.

14:15.958 --> 14:18.792
Everyone knows
that you are incapable

14:18.875 --> 14:21.500
of doing anything
really dangerous or subversive.

14:21.583 --> 14:23.750
Oh, that's good.

14:23.833 --> 14:26.042
I-I don't know about incapable.

14:26.125 --> 14:27.500
They always
overwrap these things.

14:27.583 --> 14:29.250
You have to be a magician
to open it.

14:29.333 --> 14:32.208
I mean, you know, if-if I put
my mind to it

14:32.292 --> 14:34.292
I mean, I-I-I suppose

14:34.375 --> 14:35.417
I mean, it's just that

14:35.500 --> 14:36.625
you know, once, I did take--

14:36.708 --> 14:37.958
- Vir.
- Oh, yes.

14:38.042 --> 14:40.792
Take the compliment
for what it is, hmm?

14:40.875 --> 14:41.917
Yes.

14:44.208 --> 14:45.708
(Londo)
Very nice.

14:49.667 --> 14:51.958
Good workmanship.

14:52.042 --> 14:53.708
They give you any instructions?

14:53.792 --> 14:57.042
Yes, the dose of neural toxins
is very small

14:57.125 --> 14:59.458
completely undetectable, okay.

14:59.542 --> 15:01.167
But because it is so small

15:01.250 --> 15:04.708
it has to be delivered directly
into the target. Okay.

15:04.792 --> 15:07.625
You-you couldn't just put it
in his food. It wouldn't work.

15:07.708 --> 15:09.958
It wouldn't get past
his tasters anyway.

15:10.042 --> 15:11.000
Go on.

15:11.083 --> 15:12.833
You must place it right here

15:12.917 --> 15:14.292
between his hearts

15:14.375 --> 15:16.708
and then press that button.

15:18.792 --> 15:20.750
'The toxin will paralyze
his neural system'

15:20.833 --> 15:22.875
'which will cause
his heart to stop.'

15:22.958 --> 15:24.833
And then when you
pull it out..

15:24.917 --> 15:27.250
...an organic sealant
will cover up the wound.

15:27.333 --> 15:28.667
Uh-uh, you won't be able
to see it

15:28.750 --> 15:30.167
unless you knew
what you were looking for

15:30.250 --> 15:33.583
and we hope that they won't be.

15:33.667 --> 15:35.500
How fast does the poison work?

15:35.583 --> 15:38.875
Very quickly.
He said almost instantaneously.

15:38.958 --> 15:41.083
Almost? Eh!

15:41.167 --> 15:43.000
How fast is almost?

15:43.083 --> 15:46.625
Time enough for him to stagger
back into the main room

15:46.708 --> 15:50.292
and cry out,
"Londo killed me!" Hmm?

15:50.375 --> 15:52.667
Or maybe just enough time
for him to say

15:52.750 --> 15:56.250
"Londo killed, ah!"

15:56.333 --> 15:57.792
Maybe he won't even
get that out.

15:57.875 --> 16:00.000
I mean, he'll just maybe go

16:00.083 --> 16:01.792
"Lon, ah!"

16:03.292 --> 16:05.417
Or maybe he'll just
be totally delirious

16:05.500 --> 16:08.208
and-and say everything
backwards and say

16:08.292 --> 16:11.125
"Kill Londo! Ah!"

16:12.458 --> 16:15.833
I-I was just making
a-a play on the..

16:15.917 --> 16:18.042
Well, it's time.

16:19.458 --> 16:21.375
They're going to parade G'Kar
before the leaders

16:21.458 --> 16:25.708
of some local towns to encourage
cooperation, yes?

16:25.792 --> 16:27.167
We must be there.

16:28.833 --> 16:30.625
[dramatic music]

16:47.833 --> 16:50.917
[indistinct chatter]

17:11.917 --> 17:14.375
They must not see
you are afraid.

17:15.458 --> 17:17.792
Be strong.

17:17.875 --> 17:19.083
[grunts]

17:26.292 --> 17:28.375
[indistinct chatter]

17:32.542 --> 17:36.167
Ah, our guest is almost here.

17:36.250 --> 17:39.667
Now, you will watch and see
the justice of Cartagia.

17:39.750 --> 17:41.375
'Swift, but fair.'

17:41.458 --> 17:44.792
'Tempered by wisdom,
yet unwavering in retribution.'

17:44.875 --> 17:46.417
Remember what you see here today

17:46.500 --> 17:48.792
for it is the stuff of legends.

17:52.875 --> 17:54.458
Just to be on the safe side

17:54.542 --> 17:56.917
I had his chains replaced
by my personal guards.

17:57.000 --> 17:58.667
The others looked weak.

18:00.750 --> 18:03.667
Citizen G'Kar,
you stand accused

18:03.750 --> 18:06.583
of acts of violence
against the Centauri Republic

18:06.667 --> 18:09.625
directing insurrection
against our lawful rule.

18:09.708 --> 18:13.375
You are charged with murder,
sedition, treason, terrorism

18:13.458 --> 18:17.542
and an assortment of other
charges listed on the docket.

18:17.625 --> 18:21.458
The penalty for these crimes
is death by vivisection.

18:22.917 --> 18:24.250
How do you plead?

18:24.917 --> 18:26.958
[intense music]

18:32.917 --> 18:34.375
How do you plead?

18:42.083 --> 18:43.583
You cannot break those chains.

18:43.667 --> 18:45.708
They are made
of solid kirrilium.

18:46.917 --> 18:48.792
[music continues]

18:54.583 --> 18:56.000
[G'Kar grunting]

18:59.792 --> 19:01.542
[grunting]

19:05.167 --> 19:07.375
[indistinct chatter]

19:08.792 --> 19:10.625
Majesty, this way.
Hurry, hurry.

19:14.958 --> 19:16.708
Completely irresponsible.

19:16.792 --> 19:18.167
The chains
weren't properly secured.

19:18.250 --> 19:20.042
I can't have it getting out.
They'll have to be killed.

19:20.125 --> 19:21.167
- All of them killed!
- Majesty.

19:21.250 --> 19:23.167
Incompetent behavior!

19:23.250 --> 19:25.583
Absolutely incompetent.

19:25.667 --> 19:26.625
Be quiet!

19:26.708 --> 19:28.625
Quiet? Quiet?

19:28.708 --> 19:30.292
[laughing]

19:30.375 --> 19:33.083
You would tell the stars
to darken on a whim?

19:33.167 --> 19:34.375
What, would you tear down
the mountains

19:34.458 --> 19:35.875
because their height
offends you?

19:35.958 --> 19:37.583
Who are you?

19:37.667 --> 19:40.917
Where were you?

19:41.000 --> 19:44.542
Where were you when my destiny
was written in those stars?

19:45.833 --> 19:47.250
[intense music]

19:48.667 --> 19:52.833
Where were you when the Gods
themselves shined down upon me?

19:52.917 --> 19:55.125
Huh? You dare to speak to me?

19:55.208 --> 19:56.500
No, you can burn.

19:56.583 --> 19:58.375
You can burn
with Centauri Prime.

19:58.458 --> 19:59.833
You can burn with the rest.

19:59.917 --> 20:02.583
Burn with the cities,
burn with the temples

20:02.667 --> 20:04.458
burn with all of them!

20:06.000 --> 20:07.542
[gasping]

20:12.625 --> 20:13.667
No!

20:17.542 --> 20:21.250
I was to be a God,
you understand?

20:21.333 --> 20:23.708
- A God.
- The emperor has collapsed.

20:23.792 --> 20:25.458
We think it is his heart.

20:25.542 --> 20:27.792
Hurry, we need a doctor.

20:39.083 --> 20:41.167
[indistinct chatter]

20:43.792 --> 20:46.000
We have just come
from his majesty's bed.

20:47.417 --> 20:49.208
The emperor..

20:49.292 --> 20:51.333
...is dead.

20:51.417 --> 20:54.167
(male #1)
'I personally supervised
the royal physician.'

20:54.250 --> 20:56.000
There is nothing to be done.

20:56.083 --> 20:59.917
It is as if his hearts
just gave out.

21:00.000 --> 21:03.000
The emperor believed in heeding
the wisdom of the Gods.

21:04.250 --> 21:07.833
Well, twice, the emperor
of the Centauri Republic

21:07.917 --> 21:11.375
has died while acting
in relation to Narn.

21:11.458 --> 21:14.042
Emperor Turhan while trying
to make peace

21:14.125 --> 21:16.333
and now Cartagia.

21:16.417 --> 21:17.667
'I believe Cartagia would say'

21:17.750 --> 21:21.250
that this is a sign
from the Gods.

21:21.333 --> 21:25.042
A sign to leave
this place forever.

21:25.125 --> 21:26.292
I concur.

21:27.583 --> 21:31.667
We have taken our revenge
for the war.

21:31.750 --> 21:35.250
Outside there is nothing
but rubble.

21:35.333 --> 21:38.000
There is nothing
to be gained here.

21:38.083 --> 21:40.833
And there is much
to be done back home.

21:40.917 --> 21:46.000
We have three days to correct
the emperor's misjudgment

21:46.083 --> 21:48.958
about the Shadow vessels
now based on Homeworld.

21:49.042 --> 21:51.042
Yes. We must act quickly.

21:51.125 --> 21:52.375
Cartagia has no heirs

21:52.458 --> 21:53.833
and there's no clear line
of ascension.

21:53.917 --> 21:57.208
Nor do we have time
to appoint a new emperor.

21:57.292 --> 21:58.875
I therefore nominate
Londo Mollari

21:58.958 --> 22:01.625
of the house Mollari to
the position of prime minister.

22:01.708 --> 22:03.458
I can think of no one
more qualified

22:03.542 --> 22:07.208
to deal with this threat
to planetary security.

22:07.292 --> 22:09.083
Does this have your blessing?

22:09.167 --> 22:10.375
(all)
Yes.

22:13.083 --> 22:15.542
We are yours to command..

22:15.625 --> 22:16.875
'...prime minister.'

22:17.917 --> 22:19.708
[intense music]

22:21.250 --> 22:23.417
[intense music]

22:29.208 --> 22:31.208
I've finished compiling
the latest attacks

22:31.292 --> 22:33.000
by the Shadows and the Vorlons.

22:33.083 --> 22:34.958
They continue to target
support facilities

22:35.042 --> 22:36.708
and colonies
that have taken sides.

22:36.792 --> 22:38.083
It's all hit-and-run stuff.

22:38.167 --> 22:39.875
When they come in
with just enough firepower

22:39.958 --> 22:41.917
to protect their planet killers
then blow everything to hell

22:42.000 --> 22:43.250
then jump out again.

22:43.333 --> 22:44.833
Perhaps they're doing
what we're doing.

22:44.917 --> 22:47.167
Building up their forces
for one big assault.

22:47.250 --> 22:48.583
Exactly. I've received--

22:48.667 --> 22:50.458
In the meanwhile,
they're using these attacks

22:50.542 --> 22:52.417
to keep the other side
off-balance, soften them up.

22:52.500 --> 22:53.917
What I don't understand is

22:54.000 --> 22:55.542
why don't they don't just attack
the other side's Homeworld?

22:55.625 --> 22:56.750
- Well, in the interim--
- 'Lorien tells me..'

22:56.833 --> 22:58.042
(John)
'There are rules of engagement'

22:58.125 --> 22:59.458
'between the two sides.'

22:59.542 --> 23:02.292
The Shadows said
basically the same thing..

23:02.375 --> 23:04.583
...but what are the rules?

23:06.458 --> 23:08.375
Uh, you were saying
something, Lennier?

23:08.458 --> 23:10.333
Yes, I was about to..

23:10.417 --> 23:12.625
[beeping]
Yes?

23:12.708 --> 23:14.292
(female #1 on radio)
'Captain, we've got a
signal coming in'

23:14.375 --> 23:15.458
'for Ambassador Delenn.'

23:15.542 --> 23:17.000
'It's from White Star 14.'

23:17.083 --> 23:18.458
I ordered several ranger ships

23:18.542 --> 23:20.708
to the areas where some of these
attacks have taken place

23:20.792 --> 23:23.458
to see if they could
get more information.

23:23.542 --> 23:24.792
Put it through, please.

23:26.208 --> 23:28.000
[dramatic music]

23:31.042 --> 23:34.833
(Ericsson)
'Entil'Zha, we found a colony
under attack by Shadow forces.'

23:34.917 --> 23:36.667
The Shadow planet killer
has just appeared.

23:36.750 --> 23:39.208
We've sent down a probe
to investigate.

23:39.292 --> 23:40.708
Show me.

23:42.667 --> 23:44.708
[intense music]

23:50.917 --> 23:52.417
In Valen's name..

24:00.875 --> 24:03.000
Scanners indicate the missiles
have penetrated

24:03.083 --> 24:05.500
the surface of the planet..

24:05.583 --> 24:08.000
...burrowing straight down.

24:08.083 --> 24:09.292
Ten miles.

24:10.708 --> 24:12.958
Twenty. I don't believe it.

24:13.042 --> 24:15.792
They're nearly through to
the molten core of the planet.

24:15.875 --> 24:18.542
Wait, they've stopped.
It's..

24:18.625 --> 24:20.208
Ericsson?

24:20.292 --> 24:21.792
Ericsson, what was that?

24:21.875 --> 24:23.875
Electromagnetic pulse
coming from the surface.

24:23.958 --> 24:25.042
We caught a piece of it.

24:25.125 --> 24:26.125
'The missiles have detonated'

24:26.208 --> 24:27.208
'near the planet's core.'

24:27.292 --> 24:28.542
'Thermonuclear reaction.'

24:28.625 --> 24:30.042
Thousands of megatons times

24:30.125 --> 24:31.417
thousands of missiles.

24:31.500 --> 24:32.917
'The planet's core
is breaking up.'

24:33.000 --> 24:34.875
'We're registering massive
tectonic movement'

24:34.958 --> 24:36.375
atmospheric disruption.

24:36.458 --> 24:38.542
It's falling apart
from the inside out.

24:38.625 --> 24:40.000
In another ten-twelve hours

24:40.083 --> 24:41.917
there won't be anyone
left alive down there.

24:44.000 --> 24:45.083
Anyone wanna tell me
how the hell

24:45.167 --> 24:46.750
we're supposed to stop that?

24:46.833 --> 24:48.333
We are outclassed,
boys and girls.

24:48.417 --> 24:49.583
If we at least knew
where either side

24:49.667 --> 24:50.833
was gonna hit next, we--

24:50.917 --> 24:53.083
That is what I've been
trying to say.

24:53.167 --> 24:55.083
Our ships have seen
the bulk the Vorlon fleet

24:55.167 --> 24:56.125
massing in hyperspace.

24:56.208 --> 24:57.417
And based on their movements

24:57.500 --> 24:59.417
we've calculated
where they will strike.

24:59.500 --> 25:01.292
It's in the report.

25:01.375 --> 25:04.000
Sector 70 by 12 by 5.

25:04.083 --> 25:06.667
Well, there's only one
inhabited planet in that sector.

25:06.750 --> 25:07.958
It's Coriana VI.

25:10.500 --> 25:13.792
Lennier, there are over six
billion people on that planet.

25:13.875 --> 25:16.000
I know.

25:16.083 --> 25:17.375
Ericsson,
keep this frequency open.

25:17.458 --> 25:19.250
I'll need to talk to you later.

25:19.333 --> 25:22.833
I may be asking a great deal
of you and your crew.

25:24.167 --> 25:26.583
Convene the league worlds.
We'll meet here in an hour.

25:26.667 --> 25:29.167
And make sure they've seen this
before we start.

25:30.250 --> 25:31.792
It'll scare the hell
out of them.

25:37.500 --> 25:38.750
[knocks on door]

25:42.958 --> 25:44.667
(Londo)
Vir?

25:44.750 --> 25:47.167
Vir, where are you?

25:47.250 --> 25:48.708
Come on, we have to go.

25:48.792 --> 25:49.875
[glass shatters]

25:51.125 --> 25:53.458
We do not have time
for games, Vir.

25:53.542 --> 25:54.792
The ship is waiting.

25:57.375 --> 26:00.750
I was toasting Emperor Cartagia.

26:00.833 --> 26:03.125
And since he wasn't here..

26:03.208 --> 26:04.833
...I drank for him.

26:06.292 --> 26:09.292
And then, I couldn't be rude

26:09.375 --> 26:12.125
so I had to drink with him.

26:12.208 --> 26:16.333
And so, first it was me
drinking for him..

26:16.417 --> 26:19.042
...and then him
drinking for me..

26:19.125 --> 26:23.333
...and then I kind of
got into this kind of cycle.

26:23.417 --> 26:25.458
And then here comes Cartagia

26:25.542 --> 26:27.000
his glass broke

26:27.083 --> 26:30.042
and, well, maybe it was
my glass, actually.

26:30.125 --> 26:32.333
Would you like some?
Because you know what?

26:32.417 --> 26:35.292
I think this is
Cartagia's glass after all

26:35.375 --> 26:37.708
so it'd be quite appropriate,
don't you think?

26:37.792 --> 26:39.167
You're drunk.

26:39.250 --> 26:42.583
Well.. Absolu.. Positi..

26:42.667 --> 26:46.333
Oh, you betcha.

26:46.417 --> 26:49.333
I figured it always worked
for you, Londo.

26:49.417 --> 26:53.083
Look, let me,
let me ask you something.

26:53.167 --> 26:57.542
How much more before
I can look in the mirror

26:57.625 --> 26:59.542
and not see myself?

26:59.625 --> 27:02.458
Because I keep looking..

27:02.542 --> 27:05.417
...and I'm always there..

27:05.500 --> 27:07.667
...and right now, I..

27:07.750 --> 27:09.417
...don't wanna see me.

27:09.500 --> 27:11.833
You're behaving like a fool.

27:11.917 --> 27:14.000
You did what was necessary.

27:14.083 --> 27:17.208
You've saved the lives
of millions of our people.

27:17.292 --> 27:18.958
'He had to be stopped.'

27:19.042 --> 27:20.375
- 'He--'
- Don't you understand it?

27:20.458 --> 27:23.958
I've never done anything
like this before.

27:24.042 --> 27:26.958
I close my eyes,
and I always see his face!

27:28.458 --> 27:29.958
[sobbing]

27:40.292 --> 27:42.792
Don't you know
that all I ever wanted

27:42.875 --> 27:45.708
was just a good job.

27:47.917 --> 27:51.042
Small title, nothing fancy.

27:51.125 --> 27:53.958
A-a-a wife I could love, and..

27:55.333 --> 27:57.625
...maybe even one that could..

27:57.708 --> 28:00.958
...actually love someone
like me.

28:02.250 --> 28:05.292
I never wanted to be here.

28:05.375 --> 28:07.750
I never wanted to know
the things that I know

28:07.833 --> 28:09.417
or to do..

28:12.833 --> 28:15.833
...to do the things
that I've done.

28:15.917 --> 28:17.167
I know.

28:18.417 --> 28:20.750
I know, Vir.

28:20.833 --> 28:23.083
I never wanted you in that hall.

28:24.042 --> 28:26.917
I never wanted you to..

28:31.458 --> 28:35.042
I remember when you first
arrived on Babylon 5.

28:35.917 --> 28:37.333
You were so..

28:39.042 --> 28:42.167
...full of life, innocent.

28:42.250 --> 28:44.750
I was not kind to you.

28:44.833 --> 28:46.792
I treated you poorly.

28:48.333 --> 28:49.542
'I think that I did that'

28:49.625 --> 28:52.917
'because I was envious of you.'

28:54.792 --> 28:59.125
Envious that
you had come so far..

28:59.208 --> 29:02.125
...and were still..

29:02.208 --> 29:04.833
...innocent in your way.

29:06.208 --> 29:08.292
You still believed.

29:09.375 --> 29:11.750
I, on the other hand..

29:15.417 --> 29:17.167
[sighs]

29:17.250 --> 29:22.250
I cannot tell you that
your pain will ever go away.

29:22.333 --> 29:25.833
'I cannot tell you that you will
ever forget his face.'

29:25.917 --> 29:30.875
I can only tell you
that it was necessary.

29:32.792 --> 29:36.583
You may have helped
to save our people.

29:38.250 --> 29:40.333
You did a hard thing.

29:42.917 --> 29:45.042
But you still have your heart

29:45.125 --> 29:47.333
and your heart is a good one.

29:48.750 --> 29:51.792
'You would not be in such
great pain otherwise.'

29:53.167 --> 29:56.042
That means there is still
hope for you.

29:59.042 --> 30:01.583
And for that..

30:01.667 --> 30:04.167
...I find I still envy you.

30:05.125 --> 30:06.542
[dramatic music]

30:06.625 --> 30:08.375
[fireworks bursting]

30:09.917 --> 30:11.000
What's that?

30:17.292 --> 30:18.583
Fireworks.

30:19.875 --> 30:23.542
Yes, they've learned
that we are leaving..

30:23.625 --> 30:26.333
...and that soon
Narn will be free.

30:28.292 --> 30:31.500
For my part, good riddance.

30:31.583 --> 30:35.125
It was always more trouble
than it was worth.

30:35.208 --> 30:37.542
I'm sure it will cause me
problems back home

30:37.625 --> 30:40.292
but I gave G'Kar my word.

30:41.792 --> 30:45.417
Set them free
in return for his help.

30:46.708 --> 30:48.750
I will keep my promises.

30:50.375 --> 30:52.708
My honor is all I have left.

30:58.417 --> 31:00.292
I still need you, Vir.

31:01.667 --> 31:03.750
'There is much work
to be done back home'

31:03.833 --> 31:06.042
'if we are to save
Centauri Prime.'

31:07.000 --> 31:09.292
The ship leaves shortly.

31:09.375 --> 31:11.000
Drink your last drink.

31:11.083 --> 31:12.208
Meet me there.

31:21.042 --> 31:22.833
[music continues]

31:29.792 --> 31:32.000
What was it all for, I wonder?

31:35.375 --> 31:38.083
What was any of it for?

31:44.708 --> 31:46.167
[intense music]

31:49.042 --> 31:52.917
Look, I don't know any more
than you do, alright?

31:54.417 --> 31:56.833
Where is Sheridan?
I figured he'd be back by now.

31:56.917 --> 31:59.542
The natives
are getting restless.

31:59.625 --> 32:02.875
I'm sure he is deciding
what to say to them.

32:02.958 --> 32:04.125
Good luck.

32:05.542 --> 32:07.583
[indistinct chatter]

32:08.833 --> 32:10.583
May I have your attention?

32:14.917 --> 32:17.792
By now, you have all seen
the same reports we have.

32:19.000 --> 32:20.500
You know what we're facing.

32:22.708 --> 32:25.958
The Vorlons
are going to hit Coriana VI.

32:26.042 --> 32:27.708
We can't allow that.

32:27.792 --> 32:28.917
Please.

32:33.000 --> 32:35.083
I had hoped to go against them

32:35.167 --> 32:38.333
at a time and place
of our choosing.

32:38.417 --> 32:41.208
But with six billion
lives at stake..

32:41.292 --> 32:44.167
...we don't
have that luxury anymore.

32:44.250 --> 32:47.542
So we're going to launch
our counter offensive.

32:47.625 --> 32:50.208
Phase one will require
one-third of our fleet.

32:50.292 --> 32:53.208
Their job will be to slow down
the Vorlon advance

32:53.292 --> 32:55.875
and buy us a little time.

32:55.958 --> 32:59.375
You'll receive your targets
in priority order.

32:59.458 --> 33:02.542
You hit them hard,
you hit them fast, and get out.

33:02.625 --> 33:03.917
And you don't have to destroy
the target

33:04.000 --> 33:05.792
odds are you won't
be able to anyway.

33:05.875 --> 33:08.542
But you'll tie up
their resources long enough

33:08.625 --> 33:10.833
to get our forces in position.

33:10.917 --> 33:13.000
We will then gather
the entire fleet

33:13.083 --> 33:15.375
outside the orbit of Coriana VI.

33:15.458 --> 33:18.750
That is where we will draw
the line against the Vorlons.

33:20.042 --> 33:23.292
You spoke of a second phase.

33:24.750 --> 33:26.083
Alongside our fleet

33:26.167 --> 33:28.500
we will have several
of the First Ones.

33:28.583 --> 33:30.417
We've been in the process
of locating them

33:30.500 --> 33:32.083
for some time now.

33:32.167 --> 33:33.583
How many we'll have

33:33.667 --> 33:36.250
I do not know.

33:36.333 --> 33:38.292
But..

33:38.375 --> 33:42.000
...there is an invitation
we have to make.

33:42.083 --> 33:43.875
I want the Shadows
there as well.

33:43.958 --> 33:45.750
- The Shadows?
- No.

33:45.833 --> 33:47.250
Now, they've been dancing
around each other now

33:47.333 --> 33:50.042
ever since this turned
into a shooting war.

33:50.125 --> 33:51.417
Taking out support systems

33:51.500 --> 33:54.125
colonies,
destroying supply lines.

33:54.208 --> 33:56.250
They've been avoiding
direct confrontation

33:56.333 --> 33:57.625
and I think I know why.

33:57.708 --> 34:00.500
It's the other reason
for delaying the Vorlon advance.

34:00.583 --> 34:03.083
We are going to force the issue
by making sure

34:03.167 --> 34:05.458
the Shadows are there
when the Vorlons come out.

34:05.542 --> 34:06.667
If they want Armageddon

34:06.750 --> 34:08.333
then by God,
let's give it to them.

34:08.417 --> 34:10.208
Well, how?

34:10.292 --> 34:11.625
If, as you say

34:11.708 --> 34:14.625
they have avoided
direct confrontation..

34:14.708 --> 34:17.833
...it is doubtful
that they will come

34:17.917 --> 34:20.042
simply because we ask them to.

34:22.583 --> 34:24.542
I know.

34:24.625 --> 34:26.958
So we'll have to try
another way.

34:27.042 --> 34:28.875
[instrumental music]

34:34.750 --> 34:35.750
Yes?

34:35.833 --> 34:37.083
I'm re-encoding this message

34:37.167 --> 34:38.458
every ten seconds,
so have your system

34:38.542 --> 34:39.458
keep up with us.

34:39.542 --> 34:41.792
I don't wanna be intercepted.

34:41.875 --> 34:43.875
Ericsson, a little while ago

34:43.958 --> 34:46.042
I said that I might
be asking a great deal

34:46.125 --> 34:47.750
of you and your crew.

34:49.417 --> 34:51.125
I've just sent four more ships

34:51.208 --> 34:53.500
to rendezvous
with your position.

34:53.583 --> 34:57.250
Once they arrive, you will
proceed to enter Shadow space.

34:57.333 --> 34:59.875
Your target is a small base
on Dorak VII.

34:59.958 --> 35:01.208
I know the one, sir.

35:01.292 --> 35:03.333
But, captain,
it's only ten light-minutes

35:03.417 --> 35:05.167
from one of their
main staging areas.

35:05.250 --> 35:07.417
They'd be able to counter attack
almost instantly.

35:07.500 --> 35:09.167
We're aware of that.

35:10.917 --> 35:14.458
We're transmitting a file
to you on a subchannel.

35:14.542 --> 35:15.917
Now, that file
contains information

35:16.000 --> 35:19.417
about a secret base we've
established near Coriana VI.

35:19.500 --> 35:20.750
'Most of the fleet
will be there'

35:20.833 --> 35:24.500
'when it goes online
in three days.'

35:24.583 --> 35:26.792
'But, Ericsson,
if this information'

35:26.875 --> 35:29.000
'falls into the hands
of the Shadows'

35:29.083 --> 35:31.125
they will launch an attack
against that base

35:31.208 --> 35:33.167
just before
it becomes operational.

35:33.250 --> 35:36.500
Don't worry, sir. We won't let
it fall into the wrong hands.

35:40.000 --> 35:41.833
[indistinct chatter]

35:42.875 --> 35:44.792
You misunderstand me.

35:45.917 --> 35:48.750
We want it to fall
into their hands.

35:48.833 --> 35:52.167
We want them in the
Coriana System in three days.

35:53.458 --> 35:55.458
We're planning
a little party for them.

35:57.083 --> 35:59.542
But, Ericsson..

35:59.625 --> 36:01.375
...if this information
comes too easily

36:01.458 --> 36:03.208
they won't believe it.

36:04.417 --> 36:06.833
We need them
to believe it's real.

36:06.917 --> 36:09.542
Real enough to fight for,
real enough to..

36:13.750 --> 36:16.542
You're not a married man,
are you, Ericsson?

36:16.625 --> 36:18.250
No.

36:18.333 --> 36:19.750
No, sir, I'm not.

36:21.500 --> 36:23.125
Well, there's that at least.

36:26.292 --> 36:27.875
What about the other four ships?

36:29.167 --> 36:31.500
They won't have anything
of value.

36:31.583 --> 36:35.333
You'll provide cover,
allowing them to escape.

36:35.417 --> 36:37.958
Your ship has the only copy
of this file.

36:39.833 --> 36:42.708
Ericsson, billions of lives
are counting on this.

36:43.833 --> 36:44.833
If there were any other way--

36:44.917 --> 36:46.125
(Ericsson)
'Understood.'

36:47.250 --> 36:49.000
We'll put up a good fight.

36:49.083 --> 36:51.958
If there's anything
that you or your crew need

36:52.042 --> 36:55.417
anyone you want us
to get a hold of--

36:55.500 --> 36:56.750
'They're Minbari, captain.'

36:56.833 --> 36:59.333
They knew
what they were signing on for.

36:59.417 --> 37:00.500
So did I.

37:01.833 --> 37:03.917
We've finished
receiving the file.

37:07.042 --> 37:08.833
Captain..

37:08.917 --> 37:11.292
...how long before
the other ships get here?

37:11.375 --> 37:13.958
Ten, maybe twelve hours.

37:14.042 --> 37:15.667
Then we'd better get ready.

37:16.875 --> 37:18.125
You can count on us, sir.

37:18.208 --> 37:19.958
We'll get it done.

37:20.042 --> 37:22.083
I know you will.

37:22.167 --> 37:24.875
Delenn.

37:25.833 --> 37:27.250
In Valen's name.

37:30.250 --> 37:31.875
In Valen's name.

37:34.333 --> 37:36.375
[dramatic music]

37:57.792 --> 37:59.875
[indistinct chatter]

38:11.583 --> 38:13.208
[grunting]

38:14.458 --> 38:16.375
Why are you celebrating?

38:19.125 --> 38:21.083
We drove them away.

38:21.167 --> 38:23.042
They knew they could not
enslave us forever

38:23.125 --> 38:26.542
and we drove them off
through strength.

38:26.625 --> 38:29.083
Is that what you think?

38:29.167 --> 38:31.292
Try to understand.

38:31.375 --> 38:33.542
The strength that defeated
the Centauri

38:33.625 --> 38:36.458
is not from weapons or arms.

38:36.542 --> 38:38.208
G'Kar.

38:38.292 --> 38:40.292
You are tired.
You're hurt.

38:40.375 --> 38:43.167
You're not seeing
this as we do.

38:43.250 --> 38:45.458
I see, G'Lorn.

38:45.542 --> 38:48.708
I see better
than you can imagine.

38:48.792 --> 38:50.125
When you've rested

38:50.208 --> 38:53.333
'we will thank you properly,
as is your right.'

38:53.417 --> 38:56.375
There will be celebrations
in the street, G'Kar.

38:56.458 --> 38:59.500
Your name will be a blessing
to any who speak it.

38:59.583 --> 39:01.625
And then, then, G'Kar

39:01.708 --> 39:04.333
you will lead us
against our oppressors.

39:04.417 --> 39:07.917
You will be the instrument
of our vengeance.

39:08.000 --> 39:09.458
With you directing us

39:09.542 --> 39:12.750
we will finally
destroy the Centauri.

39:12.833 --> 39:15.917
You have just tossed
someone off that throne.

39:16.000 --> 39:18.750
Would you put another
in his place so quickly?

39:18.833 --> 39:21.667
The Kha'Ri spoke
with many equal voices

39:21.750 --> 39:24.083
not the one voice
of a single leader.

39:24.167 --> 39:26.458
We need strength to lead us

39:26.542 --> 39:28.250
fire to forge us.

39:28.333 --> 39:29.958
We saw that in the Centauri

39:30.042 --> 39:31.625
learned that from them.

39:31.708 --> 39:33.792
Then you have learned
the wrong lessons.

39:33.875 --> 39:35.542
I will not take the throne.

39:35.625 --> 39:36.875
If the Kha'Ri is restored

39:36.958 --> 39:39.500
I will take my place among them,
but that's all.

39:39.583 --> 39:41.792
I did not fight
to remove one dictator

39:41.875 --> 39:43.583
just to become another myself!

39:43.667 --> 39:47.000
- But the Centauri are--
- Are a lost people!

39:48.250 --> 39:49.958
They are to be pitied.

39:50.042 --> 39:53.375
They are already on a course
for self-destruction.

39:53.458 --> 39:55.333
They do not need help from us.

39:56.708 --> 39:58.417
We need to redress our wounds

39:58.500 --> 39:59.958
help our people

40:00.042 --> 40:01.292
rebuild our cities.

40:01.375 --> 40:03.208
We must strike back!

40:05.292 --> 40:06.417
No.

40:08.375 --> 40:11.125
'I never thought
you a coward, G'Kar.'

40:12.625 --> 40:15.792
We suffered and died
during their occupation.

40:15.875 --> 40:17.875
Where were you?

40:17.958 --> 40:19.667
What have you endured?

40:23.625 --> 40:25.417
[intense music]

40:28.083 --> 40:29.833
What have I endured?

40:34.750 --> 40:36.542
[laughing]

40:41.583 --> 40:42.667
What have..

40:42.750 --> 40:44.792
[laughing]

40:45.583 --> 40:47.583
What have I..

40:49.042 --> 40:50.417
What have I..

40:51.792 --> 40:53.750
[intense music]

41:00.583 --> 41:02.375
(Ericsson over speaker)
'Target destroyed.'

41:02.458 --> 41:05.583
'Shadow vessel still
coming after us.'

41:05.667 --> 41:07.333
'Engine's damaged.'

41:07.417 --> 41:09.042
'Weapons system at 30 percent.'

41:10.917 --> 41:13.083
'Get away while you can.
We'll cover you.'

41:14.625 --> 41:16.542
'They're coming in!'

41:16.625 --> 41:18.417
'Ericsson to rest
of White Star fleet.'

41:18.500 --> 41:20.708
'Can you receive?'

41:20.792 --> 41:22.042
'We need help.'

41:22.125 --> 41:24.875
'Is anyone there?'

41:24.958 --> 41:27.583
'We can't let them
take us alive.'

41:27.667 --> 41:29.208
'Isil'zha, veni.'

41:29.292 --> 41:30.333
'In Valen's name.'

41:30.417 --> 41:31.875
[radio static]

41:33.958 --> 41:35.333
Is it..

41:37.958 --> 41:39.208
It's over.

41:39.292 --> 41:41.875
The Shadows took the bait.

41:41.958 --> 41:43.333
There's no turning back now.

41:43.417 --> 41:47.250
No. The attacks on Vorlon
targets have begun.

41:47.333 --> 41:49.250
The rest of the fleet
is waiting for us.

41:49.750 --> 41:51.000
Mm.

41:52.458 --> 41:54.333
Then we should go.

41:57.833 --> 41:59.750
(John)
Captain's personal log.

41:59.833 --> 42:02.333
Final entry.

42:02.417 --> 42:04.875
We're going into the heart
of the fire.

42:04.958 --> 42:06.750
On one side the Vorlons

42:06.833 --> 42:09.083
on the other, the Shadows..

42:09.167 --> 42:11.875
...and us in the middle.

42:11.958 --> 42:14.125
Whether any of us
will ever come back..

42:15.667 --> 42:17.750
...I don't know.

42:17.833 --> 42:19.583
When I took command
of Babylon 5

42:19.667 --> 42:21.958
I found a note on my desk.

42:22.042 --> 42:23.875
Someone had left it there
for me.

42:25.917 --> 42:28.083
It was a poem by Tennyson.

42:28.167 --> 42:30.375
I still remember
the last part of it.

42:34.042 --> 42:36.250
"Though we are not now
that strength

42:36.333 --> 42:39.125
"which in old days
moved earth and heaven

42:39.208 --> 42:42.292
"that which we are, we are.

42:42.375 --> 42:45.542
"One equal temper
of heroic hearts

42:45.625 --> 42:48.042
"made weak by time and fate

42:48.125 --> 42:50.250
"but strong in will

42:50.333 --> 42:51.792
"to strive

42:51.875 --> 42:53.167
"to seek

42:53.250 --> 42:55.375
"to find..

42:55.458 --> 42:57.250
...and not to yield."

42:58.708 --> 43:00.917
[dramatic music]

43:04.792 --> 43:06.667
[theme music]
