21:25.033 --> 21:25.492
{\an1}HEFF!

21:27.995 --> 21:31.498
WOW! THAT WAS CLOSE.

21:35.127 --> 21:37.254
OH, NO!
HEFF'S OUT OF CONTROL!

21:37.337 --> 21:39.047
I'VE GOT TO STOP HIM!

21:40.799 --> 21:43.844
{\an1}EXCUSE ME,
COULD I BORROW YOUR JACKHAMMER?

21:43.927 --> 21:45.262
SURE, LITTLE FELLA.

21:45.345 --> 21:47.180
DO YOU KNOW
HOW TO USE IT?

21:47.264 --> 21:49.641
DO <i> I</i> KNOW HOW TO USE IT?!

21:51.435 --> 21:53.603
WOW! HE'S GOOD.

21:55.105 --> 21:56.857
HEFF, WAKE UP!

22:00.152 --> 22:03.405
WELL, THAT'S NOT GOING TO WORK.

22:23.425 --> 22:26.136
WELL, THAT WAS CLOSE.

22:26.219 --> 22:28.930
ROCKO, THAT WAS WONDERFUL!

22:29.014 --> 22:30.891
YOU SAVED HEFF!

22:30.974 --> 22:33.810
{\an1}WELL, HEH,
HE SAVED ME FIRST.

22:33.894 --> 22:36.688
LOOK, SHEILA,
I HAVE A CONFESSION TO MAKE.

22:36.772 --> 22:38.482
I'M NOT REALLY A GOOD SKATER.

22:38.565 --> 22:41.443
THE TRUTH IS,
I JUST WANTED TO IMPRESS YOU.

22:41.526 --> 22:42.110
YOU'RE A NICE GUY, ROCKO.

22:42.194 --> 22:44.571
THAT'S WHAT IMPRESSES ME.

22:44.654 --> 22:45.947
I WILL SAY THIS, THOUGH.

22:46.031 --> 22:48.450
YOU SURE KNOW
HOW TO HANDLE A JACKHAMMER.

22:48.533 --> 22:50.786
THANKS. IT'S A HOBBY.

22:50.869 --> 22:52.954
ARE YOU INTERESTED
IN JACKHAMMERING?

22:53.038 --> 22:56.291
HEY!
I'M SITTING ON TOP OF THE WORLD!

22:56.375 --> 22:58.251
(<i> laughing</i> )

22:58.335 --> 22:59.336
TOP OF THE WORLD, MA!

22:59.419 --> 23:00.337
(<i> laughing</i> )

23:00.420 --> 23:01.797
(<i> cracking</i> )

23:01.880 --> 23:04.132
(<i> screaming</i> )

23:04.216 --> 23:06.426
(<i> Heff screaming</i> )

23:04.216 --> 23:06.426
{\an3}OH, YES.

23:06.510 --> 23:07.844
COULD YOU TEACH ME?

23:07.928 --> 23:09.262
IT WOULD BE MY PLEASURE.

23:09.346 --> 23:10.097
{\an1}HOP ON!

23:10.180 --> 23:12.057
(<i> Heff continues screaming</i> )

23:12.140 --> 23:14.142
THERE'S A NICE ROCK QUARRY
JUST A FEW BLOCKS FROM HERE

23:14.226 --> 23:16.144
WHERE THE CUTTERS
MAKE THEIR LIVING.

23:16.228 --> 23:18.105
BUT THEY'LL LET US
JUMP AROUND THERE.

23:18.188 --> 23:20.649
(<i> Heff catches breath</i> )

23:20.732 --> 23:23.110
(<i> resumes screaming</i> )

23:32.702 --> 23:36.456
