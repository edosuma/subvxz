No, I mean, I don't know
many of the customs,

08:55.635 --> 08:58.369
Or the language really,
and I make my mom's recipes,

08:58.405 --> 09:01.239
But, I don't do any
of the traditional things.

09:01.374 --> 09:02.974
Don't be so hard on yourself.

09:03.010 --> 09:05.643

all the traditional viet things.

09:05.712 --> 09:08.179
Yeah, I do love
that part of my life.

09:08.215 --> 09:11.716
But, honestly, I can't imagine
my mom's wrath if I had stopped.

09:11.752 --> 09:12.984
- Yeah.
- She'd probably beat me

09:13.020 --> 09:14.719
With her shoes and a broom.

09:14.755 --> 09:16.855
See, things would've been
different if my mom was around.

09:16.857 --> 09:18.823
It's like my dad
just doesn't get it.

09:18.825 --> 09:20.858
He is weird about celebrations.

09:20.894 --> 09:23.327
Like how he said
that half-birthdays

09:23.363 --> 09:24.863
Were "just another dirty sham"

five-and-a-half year olds.

09:28.535 --> 09:30.101
Hm.

I should probably go clear
things up with him.

09:32.272 --> 09:33.938
Hm. Quick question.

09:33.941 --> 09:35.406
Do you know who nikhil
slept with at our wedding?

09:35.541 --> 09:36.841
Ew. No.

I'm trying to crack a cold case.

09:38.211 --> 09:39.811
Why?

09:39.813 --> 09:41.813
It's a good activity for hudson
to focus on right now.

09:41.815 --> 09:45.817
- And you?
- Yes, and me.

09:45.886 --> 09:47.685
- I am not well.
- No.

09:49.623 --> 09:52.690
- Dad, can we just--
- yes, okay!

09:52.726 --> 09:55.393
I could have done
a better job for you.

09:55.395 --> 09:57.128
If you remember,
when your mother died,

09:57.130 --> 10:00.898
We were both so sad nothing
ever felt the same again.

10:00.900 --> 10:02.667
I remember.

10:02.669 --> 10:06.871
Your mother was always so much
better, all these ins and outs.

10:06.873 --> 10:10.241
It just sucks to not know things
I feel I should know.

10:10.243 --> 10:12.077
Ramesh: That's fair.

10:12.079 --> 10:13.979
Although, might I remind you
that when you were a teenager

10:14.114 --> 10:16.314
You did say you didn't want
to be indian anymore.

10:16.449 --> 10:18.382

- it's a direct quote.

10:18.418 --> 10:19.718

perhaps that's on me too.

10:27.727 --> 10:29.594

to fit in at the faculty

10:29.663 --> 10:33.932
That I thought assimilation
was the best choice.

10:34.067 --> 10:36.934
Tough times.

10:36.936 --> 10:38.903
Pretty sure it's still tough.

10:38.972 --> 10:42.907

(laughing)

18:30.543 --> 18:32.009
You're kidding, right?

18:32.011 --> 18:33.845
Let's go do this
brother-sister love thing

18:33.980 --> 18:35.346
Before this escalates.

18:35.481 --> 18:37.348
Oh, leo, you better
tell me you're kidding!

18:37.350 --> 18:40.984
♪

18:41.020 --> 18:43.120
And may all good things
come your way.

18:44.691 --> 18:46.190
That your money from tet?

18:46.192 --> 18:48.425
I'm not dipping into
my drone fund.

18:48.495 --> 18:50.327
Okay, all done.

18:50.363 --> 18:52.496
How come I don't bless khia?

18:52.565 --> 18:53.831
Um...

18:53.833 --> 18:56.767
Ah, yes, um,
I think the idea is that

18:56.903 --> 19:00.104
You're both supposed
to protect each other.

19:00.173 --> 19:02.573
But, how come
I don't say it to her?

19:02.575 --> 19:04.642
I'm gonna guess
'cause of the patriarchy.

19:04.711 --> 19:08.312
You know what?
All traditions change over time.

19:08.381 --> 19:11.649
So, let's make this ours.

19:11.651 --> 19:13.250
Stay blessed,
camille of fortune.

19:13.319 --> 19:14.985
(laughing)

19:15.120 --> 19:16.853
May you always have
a freezer full

19:16.890 --> 19:19.856
Of frozen espresso, even though
it's super gross sounding.

19:19.893 --> 19:21.058
(laughing)

19:21.194 --> 19:23.460
You know what?
Let's split it.

19:23.596 --> 19:25.096
Aw! (crying)

19:27.400 --> 19:28.532
No.

19:30.703 --> 19:32.803
Thank you again for today.

19:32.839 --> 19:34.071
We cool?

19:34.073 --> 19:36.540
Yeah!
We're fine!

19:36.543 --> 19:38.008
We're fine.

19:38.044 --> 19:39.277
What's goin' on between you two?

19:39.279 --> 19:41.545
- Both: Nothing.
- We're fine.

19:41.581 --> 19:44.282
Okay, well,
there's an open invite

19:44.417 --> 19:46.217
To visit anytime, nikhil cage.

19:46.219 --> 19:48.352
- Thanks.
- (laughing)

19:48.487 --> 19:52.690
Camille, what you've started
here today is really beautiful.

19:52.825 --> 19:55.626
I'm sorry I was so hard on you.

19:55.761 --> 19:58.162
At least I kept
my favourite part alive.

19:58.231 --> 20:01.365
Your mom would be so proud.

20:01.401 --> 20:04.702
Say, if you really want to stay
connected to your heritage,

20:04.837 --> 20:06.804
Maybe we should watch
cricket together tonight.

20:06.873 --> 20:08.171
Hm, that sounds nice.

20:08.208 --> 20:10.041
Live from karachi, 1:00 am?

20:10.043 --> 20:13.577
Okay, drive safe, yeah.

20:13.646 --> 20:14.912
(speaking with helium voice)
I think I might revitalize

20:14.981 --> 20:16.781
That abandoned lot a block over.

20:16.916 --> 20:18.783
(speaking with helium voice)
oh, you totally should, yeah.

20:18.918 --> 20:21.652
- Nikhil really inspired me.
- (camille inhaling helium)

20:21.787 --> 20:24.521
- He also slept with carol.
- What?!

20:24.591 --> 20:27.257
(both inhaling helium)

20:27.293 --> 20:28.525
Hey.

20:29.862 --> 20:31.361
So...

20:31.397 --> 20:35.199
Mannix and I broke up.

20:35.334 --> 20:37.200
(both speaking in helium voices)
oh, no!

20:37.237 --> 20:38.869
Are you kidding?
This is serious!

20:38.905 --> 20:40.805
- We know, we know, we know!
- No, no, we know!

20:40.940 --> 20:42.272
(breathing quickly)
(voice returning to normal)

20:42.308 --> 20:44.075
I'm sorry, honey.

20:44.210 --> 20:47.345
(speaking in normal voice) oh,
we're gonna get through this.

20:47.480 --> 20:49.546
(laughing)

20:51.584 --> 20:55.286
(inhaling helium)

20:55.421 --> 20:58.022
(speaking in helium voice)
I'm really sad.

20:58.024 --> 20:59.423
Parents: (speaking in helium
voices) me too.

20:59.492 --> 21:01.892
(laughing)

21:04.631 --> 21:07.698
