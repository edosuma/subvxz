it's somewhere around here.

- GRAHAM: Come on, Doc, admit it.

00:40.000 --> 00:41.275
I don't know what you mean.

00:41.360 --> 00:45.673
Well, look at it! This ain't
the coronation of Elizabeth I, is it?

00:45.760 --> 00:47.513
- Mmm.
- It's like a street party.

00:47.840 --> 00:49.991
Ye olde hipster pop-up happenin'.

00:50.560 --> 00:54.031
The TARDIS is being a bit stubborn
at exact readings.

00:54.840 --> 00:57.150
- So where are we?
- Apple bobbing!

00:57.400 --> 00:59.232
I love apple bobbing.

01:00.240 --> 01:02.550
- Is this Halloween?
- No, it's Sunday.

01:02.720 --> 01:03.960
Yeah, but what's the party for?

01:04.040 --> 01:05.554
We do this every Sunday.

01:05.680 --> 01:07.114
Oh, happy Sunday.

01:07.400 --> 01:09.278
Northern accent,
we must be close to home.

(HAND BELL RINGING)

01:15.360 --> 01:18.034
Mistress Savage demands your presence.

01:18.480 --> 01:20.437
The ceremony will begin.

01:20.560 --> 01:23.029
Anybody else missing the party vibe
all of a sudden?

01:23.760 --> 01:25.319
Go on.

01:41.640 --> 01:43.233
YASMIN: Where are they all going?

01:43.320 --> 01:45.357
Whatever this is,
I need you all to remember,

01:45.440 --> 01:47.875
the most important thing
about dips into the past,

01:48.600 --> 01:51.115
do not interfere
with the fundamental fabric of history.

01:51.560 --> 01:52.994
Even if something's not right?

01:53.520 --> 01:55.273
DOCTOR: Yep, and judging
by the vibe here,

01:55.360 --> 01:56.919
something is definitely not right.

(GIRL SOBBING)

02:00.520 --> 02:01.590
Are you okay?

02:02.280 --> 02:04.272
Can you tell us what's going on here?

02:18.320 --> 02:20.357
Guys, that's Pendle Hill.

02:20.760 --> 02:22.240
We're in Lancashire.

02:23.280 --> 02:25.033
People of Bilehurst Cragg,

02:26.480 --> 02:29.154
we are forced to meet here once again.

02:30.560 --> 02:32.472
Satan stalks this land.

02:33.320 --> 02:35.437
We must continue to root him out

02:35.560 --> 02:39.873
and do whatever it takes
to save the soul of our village.

02:41.160 --> 02:44.153
Let us put the accused to the test.

02:44.680 --> 02:47.240
- Granny!
- Hush, Willa.

02:47.800 --> 02:49.760
- It's a witch trial.
- BECKA: Old Mother Twiston.

02:49.800 --> 02:51.314
Must be early 17th century.

02:51.760 --> 02:54.116
You stand accused of witchcraft

02:54.880 --> 02:57.270
and shall be tried by my ducking stool,

02:57.800 --> 03:00.474
hewn from the mightiest tree
on Pendle Hill.

03:01.120 --> 03:04.033
If you drown, you are innocent.

03:04.640 --> 03:09.510
If you survive, you are a witch
and shall be hanged.

03:09.640 --> 03:11.040
(VILLAGERS CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY)

03:11.760 --> 03:13.080
This is way too dark for me.

03:13.360 --> 03:14.616
We've got to do something, Doctor.

03:14.640 --> 03:17.872
Uh-uh. The Doc said don't interfere.
You said don't interfere, right?

03:18.280 --> 03:19.536
MOTHER TWISTON: Don't cry, Willa.

03:19.560 --> 03:20.560
(WHIMPERS)

03:21.280 --> 03:22.953
I will still be with you.

I will still be with you.

03:52.800 --> 03:54.632
BECKA: Who dares interfere
with this trial?

03:54.720 --> 03:58.157
Thirty-five witches we have tried,
and still Satan surrounds us.

03:58.360 --> 03:59.953
We shall not be stopped.

for your interference.

04:06.920 --> 04:10.072
The trials are sacred.
They are the will of God!

04:10.320 --> 04:11.595
Is she alive?

04:18.160 --> 04:19.640
I'm sorry.

- (SOBBING)
- BECKA: Now we have

04:22.680 --> 04:25.240
no way of knowing
if Mother Twiston was a witch or not.

04:26.200 --> 04:28.999
Guards, whip these wanderers
off this bank

04:29.080 --> 04:31.914
and then seize Willa Twiston.
We can take no chances.

04:32.320 --> 04:33.674
Leave her alone.

04:34.160 --> 04:36.160
I'd bet my life neither of these women
are witches.

04:36.240 --> 04:40.075
But you, Mistress Savage,
are without question, a murderer!

04:41.200 --> 04:43.476
Who are you to address me this way?

04:43.920 --> 04:45.752
I'll tell you who I am.

04:47.160 --> 04:48.310
Huh?

04:48.600 --> 04:50.353
Oh, sorry, one sec.

04:52.720 --> 04:54.040
Witchfinder General?

That's right, Witchfinder General,

04:58.440 --> 05:01.114
with my crack team,
taking over this village.

05:01.200 --> 05:02.200
Right, gang?

05:04.280 --> 05:06.636
Yeah, 'cause you
are in Special Measures.

05:06.720 --> 05:08.871
DOCTOR: Now do you recognise
our authority?

05:11.160 --> 05:13.117
I do beg your pardon,
Mistress Witchfinder.

05:13.280 --> 05:16.432
Please come to my home.
We must talk in private.

05:17.560 --> 05:19.836
If you swear not to hurt that girl
or anyone else.

05:21.680 --> 05:24.149
If that is your wish,
you have the command.

05:54.200 --> 05:55.376
If I'd have known who you were,

05:55.400 --> 05:57.357
I'd have bowed
to your authority immediately.

05:57.760 --> 06:01.037
So tell me, who exactly are you?
And what gives you authority here?

06:01.360 --> 06:04.910
I am Becka Savage,
landowner of Bilehurst Cragg.

06:05.440 --> 06:08.353
It belonged to my late husband.
Passed to me when he died.

06:08.920 --> 06:10.593
I have tried to be a benevolent leader,

06:10.680 --> 06:14.594
but it's very difficult in these times,
especially for a woman.

06:15.360 --> 06:16.680
If you're the landowner,

06:17.720 --> 06:19.757
why are you walking?
Where are the horses?

06:21.400 --> 06:23.153
Horses are banned in Bilehurst.

06:24.400 --> 06:26.392
They are creatures of Satan.

06:27.200 --> 06:28.600
I had them all shot.

06:30.720 --> 06:32.200
Hey, Doc.

06:33.360 --> 06:35.431
I've done the old
Pendle Witches Walking Trail,

06:35.560 --> 06:37.517
nobody ever mentioned Bilehurst Cragg.

06:37.800 --> 06:40.554
Never heard of it,
and she's killed 35 people.

06:40.640 --> 06:41.869
- Thirty-six, now.
- Yeah.

06:41.960 --> 06:43.758
Maybe she wipes this whole place
off the map?

06:43.960 --> 06:45.679
We're going to find out what happened.

06:45.800 --> 06:47.393
And how we can make her stop.

06:48.120 --> 06:50.016
And that hall looks like
the best place to start.

06:50.040 --> 06:51.474
YASMIN: Not the only place.

06:51.640 --> 06:53.496
I'm gonna find that girl
who's just lost her gran.

06:53.520 --> 06:56.319
We'll deal with Her Ladyship,
if you go do some family liaison.

06:56.480 --> 06:57.675
I'll meet you in a bit.

06:57.760 --> 06:59.592
Hopefully by then I'll be a bit dry.

07:08.640 --> 07:10.313
BECKA: I hope the fire has warmed you.

07:10.480 --> 07:12.073
- Some wine?
- No.

07:12.880 --> 07:15.679
So, your witch trials have become
a weekly event

07:15.760 --> 07:17.672
with a village celebration.

07:17.760 --> 07:21.231
Any moment where a witch is uncovered
and Satan driven out

07:21.320 --> 07:23.073
has to be cause for a celebration.

07:23.320 --> 07:25.312
We will not stop
until that work is done.

07:25.400 --> 07:29.155
You keep saying "Satan", but how
is Satan manifesting himself here?

07:30.080 --> 07:33.312
Blighting the crops. Bewitching animals.

07:33.400 --> 07:37.280
Plaguing people with fits,
sickness, and visions.

07:37.360 --> 07:40.194
If all that's Satan,
where do the witches come in to it?

07:40.960 --> 07:44.476
They're in league with him.
Kill the witches, defeat Satan.

07:45.080 --> 07:47.515
As King James has written
in his new Bible,

07:47.640 --> 07:49.518
"Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live."

07:49.600 --> 07:51.000
In the Old Testament.

07:51.160 --> 07:54.392
There's a twist in the sequel, "Love
thy neighbour", which is why we've come.

07:54.880 --> 07:57.270
To help you fix your problems
without killing anyone.

07:58.040 --> 07:59.400
That's what King James would want.

08:00.320 --> 08:01.320
(GASPS)

08:01.800 --> 08:03.314
BECKA: What is the meaning of this?

08:03.760 --> 08:06.275
Madam, I have come to your rescue.

08:07.880 --> 08:08.880
King James. (GASPS)

08:08.960 --> 08:11.111

- Your Majesty.

08:11.200 --> 08:13.760
KING JAMES: You may
prostrate yourselves before me,

08:14.720 --> 08:18.634
God's chosen ruler
and Satan's greatest foe,

08:18.960 --> 08:23.716
come to vanquish the scourge
of witchcraft across the land.

08:24.560 --> 08:28.759
Forgive the mask, I have enemies
everywhere and have to travel incognito.

08:28.840 --> 08:31.230
Also, I rather like the drama.

- (DOOR OPENS)
- A peculiar rag-bag of folks.

08:36.080 --> 08:38.674
And those garments... Are you actors?

08:39.159 --> 08:40.230
We are

08:41.039 --> 08:44.111
witchfinders, Sire,
as we explained to Mistress Savage.

08:45.120 --> 08:46.918
Witchfinder's assistant?

08:47.880 --> 08:50.076
So you must be the Witchfinder General?

08:50.520 --> 08:52.591
- (GROANS)
- No, she said she was.

08:52.680 --> 08:55.559
(SCOFFING) A woman could never
be the general!

08:55.760 --> 08:58.992
(CHUCKLES HALF-HEARTEDLY)
Silly me, must have got all confused.

08:59.080 --> 09:00.594
- Mmm.
- DOCTOR: Mustn't I, boss?

09:02.440 --> 09:03.669
Er, yeah, that's me, Sire.

09:03.760 --> 09:05.831
Er, Northwest Division,
promoted from Essex.

09:06.160 --> 09:07.514
And these are your underlings?

09:09.480 --> 09:13.474
It's a very flat team structure.
We all have our area of expertise.

09:13.560 --> 09:15.199
Even the wee lassie?

09:15.960 --> 09:18.236
Even me. Very handy under cover.

09:18.600 --> 09:19.954
Set a woman to catch a woman.

09:20.600 --> 09:25.800
A cunning ruse using your innate
aptitude for nosiness and gossip.

09:26.760 --> 09:27.760
(GROANS)

09:27.840 --> 09:32.596
And what is your field of expertise,
my Nubian prince?

09:32.840 --> 09:33.840
Er...

09:35.720 --> 09:36.720
Torture?

09:37.120 --> 09:38.349
- Me?
- KING JAMES: Yeah.

09:38.680 --> 09:39.750
Er...

09:40.720 --> 09:42.200
Paperwork, mostly, Your Majesty.

09:42.360 --> 09:44.192
Paper? How fascinating!

09:45.200 --> 09:46.236
We should talk.

09:46.920 --> 09:51.199
But first, madam, word has reached
me of your battle against Satan,

09:51.280 --> 09:53.431
your crusade against witchcraft.

09:53.720 --> 09:55.996
But what I saw today convinced me
you need assistance.

09:56.360 --> 09:57.696
That's what we've just been saying.

09:57.720 --> 09:58.870
Hold your tongue, lassie.

09:58.960 --> 10:01.156
Stick to snooping and leave the strategy
to your king.

10:01.600 --> 10:03.000
This is no time for the weak.

10:03.080 --> 10:06.152
Satan preys on the innocent,
even while they sleep.

10:06.560 --> 10:10.076
Together, we must purify your land,

10:10.680 --> 10:13.912
starting with the grandchild
of the witch you tried today.

10:14.440 --> 10:15.760
A fine plan, is it not?

10:16.000 --> 10:18.037
- (GASPING)
- A genius plan, Your Majesty.

10:18.320 --> 10:20.039
- Oh.
- Together we shall save the souls

10:20.120 --> 10:21.918
of my people from Satan,

10:22.560 --> 10:24.438
even if it means killing them all.

- What was that?

11:04.800 --> 11:06.075
I don't know.

11:08.040 --> 11:09.190
But I want to help.

11:09.840 --> 11:12.355
You can't. Nobody can.

11:13.280 --> 11:15.192
Wait, Willa!

11:17.160 --> 11:18.594
Becka wasn't kidding.

11:19.560 --> 11:21.040
These are hard times for women.

11:22.400 --> 11:25.598
If we're not being drowned,
we're being patronised to death.

11:30.920 --> 11:32.496
We are gonna
help them though, right, Doc?

11:32.520 --> 11:34.955
I mean, otherwise this place
won't exist by the morning.

11:35.120 --> 11:38.158
Not now those two have hit it off,
I don't know which one's more barking.

11:43.240 --> 11:45.436
A dozen hankies. That's a lot.

11:46.120 --> 11:47.520
Maybe she cries herself to sleep.

11:48.480 --> 11:50.119
Maybe. Don't worry, Graham,

11:50.200 --> 11:52.520
I'm staying here and sorting it,
even if I am just a woman.

11:52.760 --> 11:55.195
Well, to be fair to King James,
you are snooping.

11:56.000 --> 11:57.275

- (ALL GASP)
- Here you are!

12:07.920 --> 12:09.616
I've been creeping around this place
looking for you.

12:09.640 --> 12:12.520
I found that girl Willa at her granny's
grave, doing some kind of ritual,

12:12.680 --> 12:13.750
and the next thing I know,

12:13.880 --> 12:17.237
this big, kind of, mud tendril thing
attacked her!

12:17.360 --> 12:18.776
- "Mud tendril"?
- Coming up out of the ground.

12:18.800 --> 12:21.076
I had to smash it to pieces.
Got it all over me.

12:21.160 --> 12:22.799
Just the one mud tendril? How big?

12:22.960 --> 12:24.816
Oh, and when you say "ritual",
do you mean like a spell?

12:24.840 --> 12:26.776
- Like she conjured it up?
- She was scared of it.

12:26.800 --> 12:29.679
- (SONIC SCREWDRIVER WHIRRING)
- Whatever it was, it wasn't friendly.

12:29.880 --> 12:31.280
- (BLEEPING)
- Just seems to be like

12:31.320 --> 12:32.754
good old-fashioned Lancashire mud.

12:33.520 --> 12:36.400
Here's the plan. You and me need
to check out that mud and talk to Willa.

12:36.720 --> 12:38.677
You two, stick with Becka
and King James,

12:38.800 --> 12:41.190
keep them here.
Make sure they don't kill anyone else.

12:41.280 --> 12:42.794
- King James?
- It's a long story.

12:43.040 --> 12:44.269
I'll explain on the way.

12:44.640 --> 12:46.518
Remember, no more witch hunts.

12:49.080 --> 12:51.675
KING JAMES: This is Alfonso,
my personal guardian.

12:51.760 --> 12:54.719
He guards my witch-finding tools
with his life.

12:55.120 --> 12:57.510
Time is against us
if we are to get to the village

12:57.600 --> 12:59.320
and hunt down the witches
from their hiding.

12:59.400 --> 13:00.436
No!

13:00.520 --> 13:02.432
(CHUCKLES) No, we're fine.

13:02.840 --> 13:05.230
I bet you have all the best kit,
Your Majesty.

13:05.400 --> 13:07.119
I have a great many artefacts.

13:07.720 --> 13:10.918
Torture implements, charms,
and a wide selection of body parts.

13:11.000 --> 13:12.000
Oh.

13:12.800 --> 13:13.800
Here.

13:14.760 --> 13:17.195
Belonged to my first
Witchfinder General.

13:17.360 --> 13:18.999
- Oh.
- KING JAMES: Scottie,

13:19.120 --> 13:20.998
who saved my life in Berwick,

13:21.240 --> 13:23.436
then later betrayed me,
so I had him shot.

13:25.320 --> 13:26.879
I'm sure you will serve me better.

13:27.480 --> 13:28.550
You may wear the hat.

13:28.720 --> 13:29.720
(CHUCKLES)

13:31.520 --> 13:32.520
You can trust me, Sire.

13:32.720 --> 13:33.949
I can trust no one.

13:34.520 --> 13:35.680
That is why I need all these.

13:36.280 --> 13:37.280
Mmm.

13:39.520 --> 13:41.000
To ward off evil spirits.

13:41.080 --> 13:42.080
Mmm.

13:43.000 --> 13:44.354
I'll be keeping an eye on you.

13:44.640 --> 13:45.640
(CHUCKLING EXCITEDLY)

13:45.720 --> 13:47.040
(CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY) What's this?

13:47.200 --> 13:49.590
Careful, it's my pricker.

13:50.960 --> 13:52.235
Essential for inspections.

13:52.680 --> 13:55.752
A true witch will not bleed
if her mark is pricked.

13:56.760 --> 13:58.114
Madam, do you have one of these?

13:58.840 --> 13:59.956
- No, Sire.
- Hmm.

14:00.400 --> 14:02.312
You may use this. It's my spare.

14:02.560 --> 14:04.160
GRAHAM: (WHISPERING) Ryan, do something.

14:05.000 --> 14:09.711
Oh, erm, there's still some
really, really fascinating

14:10.320 --> 14:13.518
body parts in here
that you could tell us about.

14:14.320 --> 14:15.320
(MOUTHING)

14:15.440 --> 14:17.193
- Yes, perhaps later. (CHUCKLES)
- Mmm.

14:18.560 --> 14:21.200
Oh, but also, before we depart,

14:21.600 --> 14:24.638
we should make a list
of all the villagers.

14:24.760 --> 14:27.400
- Mmm.
- And names of suspects,

14:27.480 --> 14:29.517
background info.
It's all in the preparation.

14:29.640 --> 14:30.710
Well, there is no need.

14:30.800 --> 14:33.269
I know everything about this place
and my people.

14:33.480 --> 14:35.358
And I know everything about Satan.

14:35.760 --> 14:38.878
Together, we will find where he's hiding
and cut him out.

14:42.120 --> 14:43.236
By nightfall,

14:44.000 --> 14:47.789
every last witch in this village
shall be destroyed.

14:51.160 --> 14:52.160
YASMIN: Willa.

14:53.680 --> 14:55.637
My name's Yaz. This is the Doctor.

14:56.880 --> 14:57.880
Where are you going?

14:57.960 --> 14:59.314
As far away from here as I can.

14:59.640 --> 15:00.790
Don't blame you.

15:01.040 --> 15:03.839
But before you do,
can we talk to you first?

15:04.440 --> 15:05.510
We're not witchfinders,

15:05.760 --> 15:07.877
we just want to find out
exactly what's going on here

15:07.960 --> 15:09.235
and maybe we can fix things.

15:10.080 --> 15:12.640
Can you help us, Willa?
Because we want to help you.

15:15.600 --> 15:16.954
(GASPS)

15:17.160 --> 15:19.800
Wow! Are these all yours?

15:20.160 --> 15:21.240
They were my grandmother's.

15:21.600 --> 15:23.512
She made medicines to help people.

15:23.960 --> 15:25.235
She wasn't a witch.

15:25.960 --> 15:27.030
Everyone knows that.

15:27.600 --> 15:29.637
So why did Becka Savage target her?

15:29.920 --> 15:32.071
Maybe she was ashamed
of the woman who brought her up.

15:32.560 --> 15:34.199
Wait, you and Becka are family?

15:34.840 --> 15:35.876
Cousins.

15:36.400 --> 15:38.551
We were all close,
until Becka married up.

15:38.920 --> 15:41.230
(INHALES SHARPLY) Left us all behind.

15:42.640 --> 15:45.235
Still, thought it'd be safe
when the witch-hunt started.

15:46.280 --> 15:49.557
And then it just got worse and worse,
everyone turned on each other.

15:50.320 --> 15:52.994
Granny said it was only a matter of time
before they turned on us.

15:56.880 --> 15:57.996
I didn't believe her.

16:00.040 --> 16:01.640
GRAHAM: Oi, oi, hold up.
What's the rush?

16:01.680 --> 16:03.034
I want this over

16:03.160 --> 16:06.949
so we can return to the way things were
before Satan infested this land.

16:07.560 --> 16:10.280
Excuse me, when you say "Satan",
what exactly do you mean?

16:10.840 --> 16:13.958
Satan is all around us, all of the time.

16:14.320 --> 16:16.516
We must be strong
or else he will take us.

16:16.600 --> 16:17.875
Of that, I have no doubt.

16:18.400 --> 16:20.392
Really, no doubt?
What if you're wrong?

16:20.880 --> 16:23.475
Because you're killing
all these people, friends, neighbours.

16:23.600 --> 16:26.479
If people are good,
they have nothing to fear.

16:28.880 --> 16:30.599
Are you a good person, Mistress Savage?

16:33.160 --> 16:34.560
My conscience is clean.

16:35.080 --> 16:36.080
WILLA: <i>Here.</i>

16:36.240 --> 16:37.720
Granny's special tea.

16:38.360 --> 16:39.794
It soothes the soul.

16:41.160 --> 16:42.594
Unless you think I'm a witch.

16:50.880 --> 16:51.880
Are you not having any?

16:52.200 --> 16:53.316
I feel too sick.

16:55.200 --> 16:56.520
Do you mind if I check you over?

16:56.600 --> 16:58.353
Don't worry, I am a doctor.

16:58.880 --> 17:00.216
- (SONIC SCREWDRIVER WHIRRING)
- What's that?

17:00.240 --> 17:02.232
Er, specialist equipment.

17:05.000 --> 17:06.400
That movement in the mud,

17:06.480 --> 17:08.039
it was Satan, wasn't it?

17:08.560 --> 17:09.896
- Doubt it.
- (SONIC SCREWDRIVER WHIRRING)

17:09.920 --> 17:11.593
Not a big believer in Satan.

17:12.359 --> 17:14.520
My granny used to say
there was enough wonder in nature

17:14.599 --> 17:16.239
- without making things up.
- (BLEEPING)

17:16.359 --> 17:17.359
I like your granny.

17:18.720 --> 17:19.915
Completely normal.

17:20.640 --> 17:23.519
No magic, and no signs of any sickness.

17:23.800 --> 17:24.800
You're wrong.

17:25.079 --> 17:27.071
I think I know what it is
that's making you sick.

17:27.440 --> 17:29.511
I had it at my school where I'm from.

17:29.960 --> 17:31.997
When Izzy Flint
turned the whole class against me.

17:33.120 --> 17:35.157
Every day I'd wake up feeling this...

17:36.120 --> 17:37.120
Dread.

17:38.200 --> 17:39.200
Fear.

17:40.000 --> 17:42.276
- How did you get rid of it?
- YASMIN: I didn't.

17:43.320 --> 17:45.630
I just took it. Had the year from hell.

17:47.240 --> 17:50.870
When I say "hell", I don't literally
mean hell. I mean it was really awful.

17:51.080 --> 17:52.753
And I told myself when I got bigger,

17:53.160 --> 17:55.197
I'd stand up to the Izzy Flints
of this world.

17:55.440 --> 17:58.956
I can't stand up to Becka.
She'll have me tried for a witch.

18:01.240 --> 18:02.480
(SOFTLY) What am I meant to do?

18:03.400 --> 18:05.471
Seems to me like you have two choices.

18:06.200 --> 18:08.669
Run as far away from here as possible,

18:08.880 --> 18:10.360
or stick with us.

18:10.480 --> 18:13.234
We'll stand up to Becka Savage
and we'll make this place safe again.

18:13.440 --> 18:14.440
How would we do that?

18:14.600 --> 18:16.796
Ah! "We", that's good, Willa!

18:17.440 --> 18:18.794
See? Feels better already.

18:18.920 --> 18:21.719
Now, first things first,
I need to get a sample of that mud.

18:22.120 --> 18:23.236
Oh, can I use this?

18:24.800 --> 18:25.800
Oh, yeah.

18:26.640 --> 18:27.676
Want to come with us?

18:29.720 --> 18:30.720
Not really.

18:31.720 --> 18:35.111
Look at him, Alfonso's loyalty
is rare and pure,

18:35.200 --> 18:38.671
it's only a matter of time
before I inevitably get let down.

18:38.960 --> 18:40.640
Why do you find it so hard
to trust people?

18:40.760 --> 18:41.955
Mmm.

18:42.080 --> 18:44.151
It's a long, sad story.

18:44.720 --> 18:45.915
A tragedy. (LAUGHS)

18:46.440 --> 18:48.432
I've got time. Tell me.

18:52.360 --> 18:55.000
My father died when I was a baby.

18:55.280 --> 18:56.475
I feel you.

18:56.880 --> 18:59.156
I lost me mum and me nan.

19:00.800 --> 19:05.556
My father was murdered by my mother,
who was then imprisoned and beheaded.

19:07.080 --> 19:08.719
Okay, that's worse. Yeah.

19:08.840 --> 19:10.513
I was raised by regents.

19:11.080 --> 19:13.037
One was assassinated, one died in battle

19:13.160 --> 19:16.597
and another died
in suspicious circumstances.

19:17.640 --> 19:21.475
There have been numerous attempts
to kidnap me, kill me, or blow me up.

19:21.560 --> 19:22.835
It's a miracle I'm still alive.

19:22.920 --> 19:23.920
(LAUGHS)

19:26.120 --> 19:27.600
(CLEARS THROAT) You're not kidding.

19:28.400 --> 19:29.675
No, I'm not.

19:30.760 --> 19:35.551
It is a miracle that I have prevailed
whilst all around me, others fall.

19:36.840 --> 19:39.196
You should definitely get yourself
back to London, Sire.

19:40.080 --> 19:41.080
Keep yourself safe.

19:41.520 --> 19:43.716
God will keep me safe

19:44.480 --> 19:46.199
as long as I do his work.

19:48.440 --> 19:50.079
(EXHALES) Ooh!

19:50.480 --> 19:51.480
That felt good.

(JAMES CHUCKLES)

19:53.240 --> 19:54.240
Thank you.

19:54.720 --> 19:57.554
And now we can have some fun.
Eh, Ryan?

19:59.600 --> 20:00.600
Just mud.

20:00.720 --> 20:02.712
No sign of any tendency to tendril.

20:03.120 --> 20:04.839
Shouldn't be disappointed,
but I am a bit.

20:06.240 --> 20:07.560
(SONIC SCREWDRIVER WHIRRING)

20:08.040 --> 20:10.635
What was that ritual you were doing
before the tendril arrived?

20:10.960 --> 20:12.076
A prayer

20:12.400 --> 20:13.993
to help my grandmother rest in peace.

20:14.440 --> 20:18.229
I brought her body here,
I dug that grave and placed her in it.

20:18.680 --> 20:20.558
But I didn't get to finish the prayer.

20:20.720 --> 20:23.030
- You can finish it now if you like.
- Yes.

20:23.720 --> 20:25.040
DOCTOR: Right, little sample.

20:26.200 --> 20:27.475
What aren't you telling me?

20:27.880 --> 20:31.191
Whoa! I am no longer disappointed.

20:31.400 --> 20:33.073
See? The mud is alive!

20:33.160 --> 20:34.958
But now I'm not sure it's mud at all.

20:35.040 --> 20:36.600
YASMIN: It looks pretty angry in there.

20:36.760 --> 20:38.240
- WILLA: Yaz?
- Obviously doesn't like

20:38.280 --> 20:40.431
being trapped, do you? What are you?

20:41.120 --> 20:42.395
Give us a clue.

20:42.800 --> 20:43.800
What's happening?

20:43.960 --> 20:45.496
I think this is some kind
of alien matter.

20:45.520 --> 20:47.193
But I'm not sure if it's sentient.

20:47.480 --> 20:48.480
Doctor,

20:49.240 --> 20:51.152
- park that, please.
- Why?

20:58.080 --> 20:59.080
Granny!

20:59.640 --> 21:01.916
- That is not your granny, Willa.
- Yes, it is.

21:02.360 --> 21:04.033
No, that's the not-mud.

21:04.200 --> 21:07.511
(PANTING) Some sort of alien matter
filling her body

21:07.600 --> 21:08.920
and reanimating it.

21:09.240 --> 21:10.754
So, it is pretty sentient.

21:10.920 --> 21:12.149
I'm so sorry for this, Willa.

21:12.680 --> 21:14.672
Hi, not-Willa's-granny.

21:15.120 --> 21:17.800
I presume you're just using the body
to give whatever you are, form.

21:17.960 --> 21:20.077
Better than tendrils, right?
But really not right.

21:20.560 --> 21:21.789
Not cool.

21:21.880 --> 21:23.200
Is that why it went after Willa?

21:23.480 --> 21:24.630
Of course.

21:25.320 --> 21:27.277
Not to kill her, but to fill her.

Ooh, check out my rhymes.

- Oh, no! You're not filling me!

21:56.200 --> 21:57.880
I've got so many questions
right now, like,

21:57.920 --> 21:59.479
did you drink that or absorb it?

21:59.800 --> 22:02.269
Are you all one big muddy mass,
or separate entities

22:02.520 --> 22:03.715
only taking the one body?

22:04.080 --> 22:05.080
Doctor?

22:07.520 --> 22:09.910
DOCTOR: Oh.
Always good to get fast answers.

22:10.320 --> 22:11.800
(WOMAN SCREAMS)

22:12.840 --> 22:13.840
What was that?

22:14.040 --> 22:15.235
I cannot imagine.

22:15.480 --> 22:17.711
Erm, best let us deal with that, Sire.

22:17.840 --> 22:19.559
You should stay here
where it's safe, Sire.

22:19.640 --> 22:20.994
Nowhere is safe

22:22.080 --> 22:24.356
until Satan has been vanquished.

22:24.440 --> 22:25.776
GRAHAM: Oh, did it come
from that way, Sire?

22:25.800 --> 22:26.936
I thought it came from the other way.

22:26.960 --> 22:28.640
- DOCTOR: No! Stay back, please!
- Come on.

22:28.720 --> 22:30.677
I've given you the blob,
what more do you need?

22:31.440 --> 22:32.896
It's so annoying when they're silent.

22:32.920 --> 22:33.990
KING JAMES: Witchcraft!

22:34.080 --> 22:35.376
So much for keeping
that lot at the house.

KING JAMES: Stay where you are!

22:36.600 --> 22:38.193
- Hi, Sire! I know it looks bad.
- Uh...

22:38.320 --> 22:40.118
But don't worry, I'm all over it.

22:40.360 --> 22:42.556
Willa Twiston was the witch all along!

22:42.920 --> 22:46.072
- I knew it!
- I'm not. This isn't me, Becka! I swear!

22:46.200 --> 22:48.396
She's right.
It's not her and it's not witchcraft.

22:48.560 --> 22:50.256
- I'm working it out.

- Alfonso, shoot them!
- Of course, Your Majesty.

22:54.400 --> 22:55.800
No, Alfonso, don't.

Now you've made them angry.
They're getting stronger.

(JAMES WHIMPERS)

23:19.760 --> 23:21.040
I don't think they're following.

23:21.120 --> 23:24.113
(PANTING) If they're not following,
what are they doing?

23:24.200 --> 23:25.236
Want us to go and look?

23:25.520 --> 23:28.513
We escaped from Satan and you wish
to go directly back into battle?

23:28.600 --> 23:31.593
We need to know what they're up to.
Make sure no one else is in danger.

23:31.720 --> 23:34.633
I'll go too and keep an eye
on my underlings.

23:34.720 --> 23:36.552
- Very well.
- DOCTOR: I'll stay with Willa.

23:36.800 --> 23:37.916
Be careful!

23:38.760 --> 23:39.955
What were those aberrations?

23:40.120 --> 23:43.079
- It is the work of Satan!
- It wasn't Satan.

23:43.200 --> 23:45.078
Or witches, or Willa's granny.

23:45.160 --> 23:48.278
Those creatures were being controlled
by something in the mud.

23:48.520 --> 23:50.034
Something not of this Earth.

23:50.120 --> 23:52.635
Something beyond your understanding.

23:53.240 --> 23:54.469
Something from hell?

23:54.560 --> 23:56.074
More like from the heavens.

23:56.760 --> 23:58.638
It chose to kill Alfonso
when he was a threat.

23:58.720 --> 24:02.430
But in other circumstances, it fills
the bodies and uses them as vessels.

24:02.920 --> 24:04.832
I don't know why.
Maybe only when they're dead.

24:04.920 --> 24:06.752
No. It attacked me, too.

24:06.840 --> 24:07.840
DOCTOR: And why today?

24:08.120 --> 24:09.315
Because this is my problem.

24:09.520 --> 24:11.989
I can buy that this is the biggest ever
witch-hunt in England,

24:12.160 --> 24:14.800
or I can buy it's an alien mud invasion.

24:14.920 --> 24:17.230
But both on the same day?
I can't buy that!

24:17.320 --> 24:18.959
Why does the lassie speak of commerce?

24:19.040 --> 24:20.376
- DOCTOR: Oh, wait.
- I don't know.

24:20.400 --> 24:21.834
Unless they're connected.

24:23.400 --> 24:26.040
Your witch-hunt's
been going on a while now.

24:26.160 --> 24:28.834
So there's no way that mud
has just rocked up today.

24:29.600 --> 24:30.600
What do you know, Becka?

24:31.280 --> 24:33.397
What's going on here in Bilehurst Cragg?

24:34.480 --> 24:37.279
A woman who keeps an axe by her bed.
What have you seen?

24:39.640 --> 24:43.475
I have seen you with your wand,
raising your kin from the dead.

24:45.080 --> 24:46.355
- Yes.
- What? No.

24:46.480 --> 24:49.279
- Hold on a sec.
- You're no witchfinder's assistant.

24:49.480 --> 24:51.711
- You are Satan's acolyte!
- DOCTOR: I am not.

24:51.880 --> 24:54.156
That's why it's happening today,
because you are here.

24:54.280 --> 24:56.556
As you say, to take over this village.

24:56.680 --> 24:58.353
You know that's not what I meant.

24:58.480 --> 25:00.360
- We do not have time for this.
- (BLADE CLICKS)

25:00.480 --> 25:02.119
Mistress Savage is correct.

25:02.240 --> 25:04.391
It is your fault that Alfonso is dead.

25:04.560 --> 25:07.439
- I tried to save him.
- Save them

25:07.520 --> 25:08.874
from being shot?

25:09.040 --> 25:12.112
You said this evil fell from heavens.

25:12.200 --> 25:15.671
Oh yes, it fell,
like your lord, Lucifer!

25:15.880 --> 25:17.473
Honestly, if I was still a bloke,

25:17.560 --> 25:20.439
I could get on with the job and not
have to waste time defending myself.

25:20.520 --> 25:23.080
Oh, you bewitch us
with your alluring form

25:23.160 --> 25:24.389
and your incessant jabber,

25:24.480 --> 25:26.915
but I knew you were unnatural
from the very start.

25:27.520 --> 25:30.240
And now I see you
for what you really are.

25:30.320 --> 25:32.551
She was trying to save us, Sire.

25:32.640 --> 25:33.640
Thank you, Willa.

25:33.720 --> 25:35.598
BECKA: Are you sure
you're not mistaken, Willa?

25:35.680 --> 25:38.115
Or are you in league
with the witches as I first suspected?

25:38.200 --> 25:40.157
She said she wanted to help me.

25:40.240 --> 25:41.833
Who do you trust to save you?

25:42.040 --> 25:44.350
Your king? Your family?

25:44.760 --> 25:48.356
Whatever I have done,
I did to save all of our souls.

25:48.800 --> 25:50.075
What's really going on, Becka?

25:50.560 --> 25:52.119
Hold your tongue or I will cut it out.

25:54.840 --> 25:55.840
Well?

25:56.840 --> 25:59.116
Tell the truth, lassie.

26:07.160 --> 26:12.030
I did think it was strange when
they said her name was "the Doctor".

26:12.400 --> 26:15.120
Like Dr D, a necromancer.

26:15.520 --> 26:16.795
That seals it.

26:17.480 --> 26:18.709
Arrest the witch!

26:19.280 --> 26:22.352
I... I am not a witch!

do you reckon they went?

26:28.600 --> 26:30.353
Hey, guys, over here.

26:32.360 --> 26:33.430
There you go.

26:34.440 --> 26:35.590
Holly berries.

26:35.840 --> 26:37.160
No holly tree.

26:42.040 --> 26:44.760

They can't be that far ahead.

26:45.160 --> 26:46.276
Come on.

KING JAMES: Comfortable, witch?

26:56.000 --> 26:57.275
I do hope not.

26:59.720 --> 27:00.720
Come for a visit?

27:03.960 --> 27:07.749
I shall take my opportunity
to converse with an agent of Satan.

27:08.000 --> 27:11.198
If I was Satan's agent, do you seriously
think a bit of rope would stop me?

27:11.280 --> 27:13.158
I say a bit, quite a lot.

27:13.280 --> 27:14.430
Tightly bound.

27:14.600 --> 27:15.600
It's pretty painful.

27:15.680 --> 27:17.336
You know how to tie a knot
in this part of the world.

27:17.360 --> 27:20.717
I am an expert on witchcraft, Doctor.

27:21.600 --> 27:23.353
But I wish to learn more.

27:24.920 --> 27:27.879
Before you die, I want answers.

27:28.920 --> 27:31.310
Your wand, how does it work?

27:32.120 --> 27:33.270
Why do you want to know?

27:34.560 --> 27:36.791
I wish to know all the secrets
of existence.

27:36.920 --> 27:37.920
DOCTOR: Don't we all?

27:38.600 --> 27:40.956
But true knowledge has to be earned.

27:42.920 --> 27:43.956
I tell you what,

27:44.280 --> 27:47.239
I'll trade you my wand for answers
to as many questions you want to ask.

- DOCTOR: Yeah, yeah. I know.

27:56.280 --> 27:58.317
It must be comforting,
playing that role.

27:58.960 --> 28:00.440
Hiding behind a title.

28:01.440 --> 28:04.751
Just as you hide behind
"Doctor", perhaps.

Okay.

Who are you, really?

The drama?

28:38.240 --> 28:40.994
even though you're killing
and scapegoating,

28:41.440 --> 28:42.874
and stirring up hate.

28:43.840 --> 28:46.150
And you wonder why the darkness
comes back at you.

28:46.280 --> 28:47.680
There's no darkness in me.

28:48.720 --> 28:53.556
I quest for goodness and knowledge,
beauty and art, all of God's virtues.

28:53.640 --> 28:55.040
Your own mother was scapegoated.

28:55.280 --> 28:57.040
How do you square that
with your witch-hunts?

28:57.080 --> 28:58.560
What do you know of my mother?

28:59.440 --> 29:01.432
You could have seen her before she died,

29:01.560 --> 29:03.040
but you didn't want to, why?

29:03.520 --> 29:04.920
She left me

29:06.960 --> 29:09.429
when I was not even one year old.

29:09.560 --> 29:11.279
What kind of mother does that?

29:11.560 --> 29:12.994
Why would I wish to see her?

29:13.360 --> 29:15.875
Nobody will ever know
why she left you, James.

29:16.200 --> 29:19.398
But you can't go hurting people
just because you're scared

29:19.480 --> 29:21.676
to face up to the darkness inside you.

29:21.840 --> 29:23.559
You have to be better than that.

Who are you?

29:31.200 --> 29:32.520
How do you know these things?

I know because

we are all the same.

29:37.160 --> 29:40.471
We want certainty, security.

29:40.560 --> 29:43.598

or heroic.

to have pockets for a while yet.

It responded to Becka's touch because
of the Morax infection inside her.

39:31.720 --> 39:33.074
So, Pendle Hill was a prison?

39:33.160 --> 39:35.755
From what Becka said,
I'm guessing the Morax

39:35.840 --> 39:39.390
are royals with soldiers,
pretty brutal ones at that.

39:39.480 --> 39:41.995
Presumably exiled for war crimes,

39:42.120 --> 39:44.077
scrambled down into their primal form...

39:44.160 --> 39:47.039
And they stay in prison
until Becka Savage goes at that tree.

39:47.160 --> 39:49.277
Well, it can't be much of a lock
if she can break it.

39:49.360 --> 39:53.513
It's old. Eroded over billions
of years, presumably.

39:54.040 --> 39:55.952
But she must have broke it enough

39:56.040 --> 39:59.078
for part of the queen's form
to escape and infect her.

According to my calculations,
this ancient alien wood

40:02.160 --> 40:03.719
is like Semtex to Morax.

40:03.840 --> 40:05.752
That's why it made such a good lock.

40:05.840 --> 40:07.593
Right, help me break it up.

DOCTOR: Or, alternatively,

41:42.640 --> 41:45.109
Witchfinders United at your service.

41:45.240 --> 41:47.197
Yeah, mate, you better back off.

41:47.920 --> 41:49.274
Let him go, Morax.

41:49.800 --> 41:51.154
You can't have King James

41:51.480 --> 41:52.480
or this planet.

41:52.800 --> 41:53.960
RYAN: Get away from the king.

41:54.120 --> 41:55.349
(GRUNTING)

41:55.520 --> 41:57.716
The torches are working.
He won't come near the flames.

41:57.960 --> 41:59.856
RYAN: I've got you, Sire.
KING JAMES: My protector!

41:59.880 --> 42:01.519
Willa, watch out for your granny.

42:01.640 --> 42:03.518
- (SNARLS)
- You're not my granny.

42:03.600 --> 42:04.920
Let her rest!

42:05.000 --> 42:07.754
And you, Morax, back into your cell.
Now, please.

42:07.840 --> 42:10.116
Those flames don't scare me, Doctor.

42:10.280 --> 42:12.033
Nothing scares me now!

42:12.280 --> 42:13.794
WILLA: I know you're in there, Becka.

42:14.880 --> 42:16.200
I know you're scared.

42:16.400 --> 42:19.472
Nothing of that pathetic woman remains.

42:19.600 --> 42:22.399
No fear, only power.

42:22.720 --> 42:26.634
We will fill your king and kill you all!

42:26.720 --> 42:28.757
Afraid not, Morax. I'm here.

42:29.160 --> 42:30.160
(MORAX SCREAMS)

42:30.720 --> 42:32.359
- DOCTOR: Everybody back!
- (EXCLAIMING)

42:32.440 --> 42:33.696
DOCTOR: I've reactivated the prison.

42:33.720 --> 42:35.916
Back you go, King of the Morax!

42:42.880 --> 42:44.314
(ROARING)

42:45.280 --> 42:46.396
DOCTOR: Jail re-energised.

42:46.600 --> 42:47.600
MORAX: No!

42:48.200 --> 42:50.192
What have you done?

42:51.080 --> 42:53.151
Feel that security system
kicking back in,

42:53.360 --> 42:55.920
sucking every Morax cell back.

42:56.640 --> 42:58.359
Back down into Pendle Hill.

42:58.440 --> 43:00.477
Back out of the bodies they hijacked.

43:02.320 --> 43:03.320
Have peace.

43:03.520 --> 43:05.113
MORAX: No!

43:05.320 --> 43:06.879
I will not go!

43:06.960 --> 43:08.076
Yes, you will.

43:08.160 --> 43:10.675
- Burn the witch!
- DOCTOR: No, Sire, stay away!

43:10.760 --> 43:12.274
(SCREAMING)

43:17.600 --> 43:19.353
(ALL PANTING)

43:23.720 --> 43:25.439
(THUNDER RUMBLING)

43:26.280 --> 43:29.398
What, woman?
She was a witch. She confessed.

43:29.760 --> 43:32.594
- So you got what you came for.
- I have vanquished Satan.

43:34.480 --> 43:36.199
No more witch-hunts.

43:45.680 --> 43:47.751
She still does not speak to me, Ryan.

43:48.120 --> 43:49.520
Can you get through to her?

43:49.640 --> 43:51.791
Afraid not, Sire. This is on you.

43:52.200 --> 43:53.953
What apparition is this?

43:54.560 --> 43:56.791
Just another inexplicable
wonder of existence

43:56.920 --> 43:58.877
you're not going to be able
to tell anyone about.

43:58.960 --> 44:01.555
Doctor, I understand
you are displeased with me.

44:02.960 --> 44:04.474
And I owe my life to you.

44:06.080 --> 44:09.391
Not one word of any of this
shall ever be spoken.

44:10.400 --> 44:13.359
And even the name "Bilehurst"
shall be erased

44:13.760 --> 44:15.080
from all records.

44:15.840 --> 44:17.752
As long as all the villagers
make it out alive.

44:18.400 --> 44:19.550
What will you do, Willa?

44:20.920 --> 44:21.920
Find a new home?

44:22.480 --> 44:25.200
Take Granny's potions and be a healer.

44:26.960 --> 44:28.030
Be a doctor.

44:29.560 --> 44:31.074
I reckon you'll be good at that.

44:31.320 --> 44:32.470
One final command,

44:33.600 --> 44:34.954
as your king.

44:37.000 --> 44:38.639
Come back to London with me, Ryan.

44:40.560 --> 44:41.755
Be my protector.

44:46.360 --> 44:47.635
(CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY) I mean,

44:48.320 --> 44:50.039
it's a kind offer, Sire,

44:50.400 --> 44:52.039
but, er, you know,

44:52.680 --> 44:53.750
I've got stuff to do.

44:54.760 --> 44:58.436
But I'll keep me eye on you.

44:59.280 --> 45:02.512
So you behave yourself. (CHUCKLES)

45:03.840 --> 45:04.990
(LAUGHS)

45:05.600 --> 45:06.716
Or else...

45:07.400 --> 45:09.915
- (TARDIS DOOR OPENS)
- ...we will strike down upon thee

45:10.000 --> 45:13.676
with great vengeance and furious anger.

45:14.040 --> 45:15.040
Ezekiel.

45:15.240 --> 45:16.240
Tarantino.

45:18.040 --> 45:19.633
Wh... What are you all doing?

45:20.120 --> 45:21.349
A brilliant man once said,

45:22.040 --> 45:25.590
"Any sufficiently advanced technology
is indistinguishable from magic."

45:28.240 --> 45:29.754
We're just about to prove him right.

45:31.880 --> 45:32.916
(TARDIS DOOR CLOSES)

45:34.840 --> 45:36.911
(WHOOSHING)

45:41.480 --> 45:43.233
Where did they go?

45:44.520 --> 45:46.113
(LAUGHS)

45:49.720 --> 45:51.518
(THEME MUSIC PLAYING)

46:19.520 --> 46:23.719
DOCTOR: <i>A cottage in Norway in winter,
with a chimney but no smoke.</i>

46:24.080 --> 46:25.355
MAN'S VOICE: <i>Such tragedy</i>

46:26.080 --> 46:27.150
<i>makes me</i>

46:27.760 --> 46:29.080
<i>hungry.</i>
