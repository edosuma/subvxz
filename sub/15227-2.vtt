01:17.443 --> 01:19.644
Oh... Oh, no, no, no.

01:19.712 --> 01:21.780
No, I... No,
                   I understand.

01:21.847 --> 01:24.282
Yeah. All right, good-bye.

01:28.721 --> 01:31.189
Banta, Nardo? Reiger, Reiger?

01:31.257 --> 01:32.190
ELAINE:
What?
ALEX: Hmm?

01:32.257 --> 01:33.458
Come over here.
        Come over here.

01:33.526 --> 01:34.459
What?

01:34.526 --> 01:37.028
(sighs)

01:37.096 --> 01:39.097
I just talked
       to Jim's brother.

01:39.165 --> 01:41.332
It's terrible news.

01:41.400 --> 01:42.534
What is it?

01:42.602 --> 01:44.602
His dad dropped dead
       over the weekend.

01:44.670 --> 01:45.803
Oh, my... No!
                         ELAINE:
                         Oh, no!

01:45.871 --> 01:47.872
Yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah.
            No! Oh.

01:47.940 --> 01:51.476
Well, it looks like I'm the one
  that breaks the news to him.

01:51.543 --> 01:52.710
TONY:
                            You?

01:52.778 --> 01:55.446
Yeah, me.

01:55.514 --> 01:57.015
I've done this before, you know.

01:57.082 --> 01:59.184
Ask Perez over there.

01:59.251 --> 02:02.320
Hey, Perez, didn't I just
 tell you a couple of days ago

02:02.387 --> 02:04.055
that your father died?

02:04.122 --> 02:06.624
What?

02:06.692 --> 02:09.727
Oh, Perez, I meant to, uh...

02:09.794 --> 02:11.195
Oh...

02:11.263 --> 02:12.497
Look, uh, look,
                      I'm sorry.

02:12.565 --> 02:14.299
Look, take the rest
                 of the day off.

02:14.367 --> 02:15.833
Uh, all right, look.

02:15.901 --> 02:20.504
Look, Perez, the Lord works
in mysterious ways.

02:20.572 --> 02:23.675
Uh, I'll-I'll make it up to you.

02:23.743 --> 02:24.909
Louie!

02:24.977 --> 02:26.845
Louie, maybe
                      you better

02:26.912 --> 02:28.279
let one of
                    us tell him.

02:28.347 --> 02:29.713
Yeah.
          No, no, no, no,
            I can't.

02:29.781 --> 02:32.016
Yeah.
            I can't.
   This has to come from me.

02:32.084 --> 02:34.519
I mean, Iggy and I have
    a special relationship.

02:34.587 --> 02:37.021
Yeah. Well, uh,

02:37.088 --> 02:39.023
crazy as it sounds,
       Jim does consider,

02:39.091 --> 02:41.125
uh, Louie his closest friend.

02:42.228 --> 02:44.095
I... Oh.

02:44.163 --> 02:45.463
Hi, Jim. Hi.
                Hi, Jim.

02:45.531 --> 02:46.630
JIM:
              Hi. How you doing?

02:47.733 --> 02:48.967
All right. Hey, Jim...

02:49.034 --> 02:50.468
Now, Louie, Louie.
    What?

02:50.535 --> 02:51.803
Do this right.

02:51.871 --> 02:55.040
You're insulting me.

02:55.107 --> 02:57.041
Uh, Jim?

02:57.109 --> 02:58.376
Yeah?
Um,

02:58.444 --> 02:59.977
I have something to tell you.

03:00.045 --> 03:01.546
I think you better sit down.

03:01.613 --> 03:05.516
The best way to do this is
  to just come out and say it.

03:05.584 --> 03:07.118
Come on here, come sit down.

03:07.186 --> 03:08.453
Come sit down.

03:10.423 --> 03:11.355
Uh...

03:11.423 --> 03:12.357
(clears throat)

03:12.424 --> 03:13.358
All right.

03:15.461 --> 03:17.428
It's about your father.

03:19.064 --> 03:21.332
He's no longer with us.

03:23.068 --> 03:25.003
He never was.

03:27.539 --> 03:29.473
He lives in Boston.

03:30.543 --> 03:32.176
Uh, no, no.

03:32.244 --> 03:36.348
Jim, he-he's gone on
to his final resting place.

03:36.415 --> 03:39.684
A condo in Palm Beach?

03:39.752 --> 03:40.985
No, no, no, no.

03:41.053 --> 03:42.987
Jim...

03:44.322 --> 03:46.557
Your father died.

03:46.625 --> 03:48.860
What?

03:48.928 --> 03:51.729
Yeah, yeah, he died on Friday,
and the funeral was Sunday.

03:51.797 --> 03:53.064
Your brother called.

03:53.132 --> 03:56.033
He tried to get in touch
with you, but he couldn't.

03:56.101 --> 03:57.201
Dad?

03:59.371 --> 04:00.604
Dad's dead.

04:00.672 --> 04:03.841
It was his heart.

04:03.909 --> 04:05.142
(laughs)

04:05.210 --> 04:07.345
I-I told him
                 to lose weight.

04:07.413 --> 04:09.180
Hey, Jim, Jim, we're
        really sorry about this.

04:09.248 --> 04:10.515
Yeah...
            Oh, it's so
             horrible.

04:10.582 --> 04:13.351
This is the way
     things are.

04:13.419 --> 04:16.254
Uh, give-give...
            give me a cab, boss.

04:16.321 --> 04:17.488
I want to
                     go to work.

04:17.555 --> 04:18.822
No, no, no, no, Jim.
       Take the day off.

04:18.891 --> 04:20.024
No, no, no, no,
                     no, no, no.

04:20.091 --> 04:21.190
No, no, no.

04:21.259 --> 04:22.661
I want to keep my
              mind off my grief.

04:22.728 --> 04:24.295
No, no, no. Take the
day. What? What?

04:24.363 --> 04:26.730
Give me a cab so I can
             get through the day

04:26.798 --> 04:29.701
without thinking
                   about my dad.

04:29.768 --> 04:33.237
All right, uh, Jeff,
     give him cab four ten.

04:33.305 --> 04:34.839
Four ten!

04:34.907 --> 04:36.908
Boy, how ironic.

04:36.976 --> 04:39.843
That's how much Dad weighed.

04:45.817 --> 04:48.019
Oh!

04:48.086 --> 04:49.687
What a week.

04:49.755 --> 04:54.459
I mean, uh, first Garcia's dad,
         and now Jim's.

04:54.527 --> 04:56.294
Garcia?

04:56.362 --> 04:58.429
You told Perez.

05:01.667 --> 05:03.668
Ah, no!

05:09.574 --> 05:11.042
Hey, hi, Tony.

05:11.110 --> 05:12.310
Damn it!

05:12.377 --> 05:13.878
What is this world coming to?

05:13.946 --> 05:16.114
It's not a decent place
to raise kids anymore.

05:16.181 --> 05:17.415
I'm appalled.

05:17.482 --> 05:19.116
The Yanks lost
                    another one?

05:19.184 --> 05:20.318
Would I be this upset

05:20.386 --> 05:22.087
just 'cause
  the Yanks lost another game?

05:22.154 --> 05:23.521
Double-header?

05:23.589 --> 05:25.924
To Seattle.

05:25.991 --> 05:27.392
But it's more than that.

05:27.459 --> 05:28.960
It's Steinbrenner.
      He's doing it again.

05:29.028 --> 05:30.294
He's undermining his team,

05:30.362 --> 05:32.763
and he's wrecking
  a great New York tradition.

05:32.831 --> 05:33.964
Tony, what are you
talking about?

05:34.032 --> 05:35.266
Am I the only
                    one who sees

05:35.334 --> 05:36.701
that Steinbrenner's
      changing this whole world?

05:36.769 --> 05:39.036
Wait. Tony, how could
Steinbrenner change the world?

05:39.104 --> 05:40.538
The domino theory.

05:40.606 --> 05:43.541
You see, Steinbrenner ruins
       the spirits of the Yanks,

05:43.608 --> 05:44.875
they lose.

05:44.943 --> 05:46.711
Their fans become depressed
         and irritable.

05:46.779 --> 05:48.646
Bus drivers, cops, waitresses--

05:48.713 --> 05:51.449
they go to work, but
         they do a bad job, see?

05:51.517 --> 05:53.017
That affects
          everybody in the city,

05:53.085 --> 05:54.652
including the politicians
              and the bankers...

05:54.720 --> 05:55.820
Oh...

05:55.888 --> 05:57.721
...who make bad decisions
that hurt the economy

05:57.789 --> 05:59.391
and affect the rest
of the world.

05:59.458 --> 06:01.459
Before you know it, OPEC
          is raising its prices,

06:01.527 --> 06:03.961
and there's another war
  breaking out in South America.

06:04.029 --> 06:05.295
I just heard the Russians

06:05.363 --> 06:07.431
launched another
               killer satellite.

06:11.971 --> 06:12.903
Steinbrenner.

06:12.971 --> 06:14.705
Oh, come on.

06:14.773 --> 06:17.809
Uh, e-excuse me.

06:17.876 --> 06:19.544
I'm looking
     for a James Caldwell.

06:19.611 --> 06:21.345
Oh, I believe
      he changed his name.

06:21.413 --> 06:23.747
You may know him
       as Jim Ignatowski.

06:23.815 --> 06:25.717
I'm the attorney
    for his father's estate.

06:25.785 --> 06:28.352
Oh, this must be about the will.

06:28.420 --> 06:30.421
Um, well, uh...

06:30.489 --> 06:31.923
Jim isn't here
           right now,

06:31.990 --> 06:34.692
uh, so why don't you have
       yourself a cup of coffee,

06:34.760 --> 06:36.194
and you wait for him?

06:36.262 --> 06:38.196
Oh, thank you.

06:39.732 --> 06:40.931
Here you are.

06:40.999 --> 06:42.333
(laughs)

06:42.400 --> 06:44.334
Oh, Jeff, give
                the man a donut.

06:46.238 --> 06:47.605
What's going on, Lou?

06:47.673 --> 06:50.374
This is the attorney
              for Iggy's father,

06:50.442 --> 06:52.076
who was loaded.

06:52.143 --> 06:56.681
I got a feeling my buddy
          Iggy is gonna be rich.

06:57.782 --> 06:58.950
How's the coffee?

06:59.018 --> 07:00.952
Fine.
    A cake donut?!

07:01.019 --> 07:02.487
Oh.

07:02.554 --> 07:03.821
Jeff!

07:03.889 --> 07:05.323
This man is an attorney.

07:05.390 --> 07:06.690
Give me that box.

07:06.758 --> 07:07.892
Eight years of school.

07:07.960 --> 07:11.629
Here. A maple log.

07:11.697 --> 07:15.266
Oh, this is my lucky day.

07:23.241 --> 07:24.175
Iggy...

07:24.242 --> 07:25.743
James!

07:25.811 --> 07:26.911
This here is,
             uh...

07:26.979 --> 07:28.246
James!
            This is...

07:28.314 --> 07:29.981
It's good to
                  see you again.

07:30.049 --> 07:32.150
It's been a long time.

07:32.218 --> 07:34.152
Yes, it has. Who are you?

07:34.219 --> 07:37.522
I-I... I'm John Bickers,
       y-your father's attorney?

07:37.589 --> 07:39.056
Oh.

07:39.124 --> 07:41.025
Uh, James, I-I
                 think it's time

07:41.093 --> 07:43.161
that we discussed
      your father's will.

07:43.228 --> 07:44.862
Oh, yeah, yeah.

07:44.930 --> 07:46.063
(clears throat)

07:46.131 --> 07:48.399
My father dropped me
out of that

07:48.467 --> 07:50.635
when I dropped out
of Harvard.

07:50.702 --> 07:55.005
Uh, but he reinstated you a
      few months before he died.

07:55.073 --> 07:59.744
As a matter of fact,
         your father left you...

08:02.147 --> 08:03.581
Uh...

08:05.684 --> 08:08.753
Three and a half
million dollars.

08:08.820 --> 08:10.120
(thumping)

08:16.862 --> 08:17.795
I beg your pardon.

08:17.863 --> 08:20.331
I couldn't help
overhearing.

08:20.399 --> 08:21.832
Yeah, right here.

08:21.900 --> 08:23.033
All right.

08:23.101 --> 08:24.202
Uh,

08:24.270 --> 08:26.904
James, there-there is a, uh...
           a problem

08:26.972 --> 08:28.072
about your inheritance.

08:28.140 --> 08:31.609
Uh, could we talk,
         uh, privately?

08:31.677 --> 08:33.210
There's nothing
       you can't tell me

08:33.278 --> 08:37.181
that you can't say
    in front of my friends.

08:37.249 --> 08:39.549
Well, your...

08:39.616 --> 08:42.486
your brother and sister
   have petitioned the court

08:42.554 --> 08:46.290
to establish a conservatorship
      of your inheritance.

08:46.358 --> 08:48.392
Bless them.

08:48.460 --> 08:50.695
Uh, James,
   you-you don't understand.

08:50.762 --> 08:53.431
Uh, you see, they want
            to take you to court

08:53.498 --> 08:56.000
to prove that
             you're incompetent.

08:56.068 --> 08:57.401
Now, if they win,

08:57.469 --> 08:59.903
they'll be in charge
                  of your money.

08:59.971 --> 09:01.305
They'll give you
                    an allowance

09:01.373 --> 09:04.241
and decide how and
              where you'll live.

09:04.309 --> 09:07.811
In-In other words, the
        inheritance'll be yours,

09:07.879 --> 09:10.080
but you'll be treated
                   like a child.

09:10.148 --> 09:12.049
That sounds pretty good.

09:12.117 --> 09:13.050
LOUIE:
             Iggy!

09:13.117 --> 09:14.619
Get over here!

09:14.687 --> 09:15.820
Get up here!

09:15.888 --> 09:17.054
ALEX:
Jim.

09:17.122 --> 09:18.689
They're doing you wrong.

09:18.756 --> 09:19.891
Jim.

09:19.958 --> 09:20.924
Jim, Jim, this
is terrible.

09:20.992 --> 09:21.926
This is terrible.

09:21.994 --> 09:23.494
They're
                    robbing you!

09:23.562 --> 09:24.795
Your brother
and sister, uh...

09:24.863 --> 09:26.430
They're going
against your father's wishes.

09:26.498 --> 09:28.532
Don't you understand?

09:28.600 --> 09:29.867
You're right!

09:29.934 --> 09:32.770
They're not gonna get away
           with this!

09:32.838 --> 09:35.472
You tell my brother
           and sister

09:35.540 --> 09:37.841
they're in for more
    than they bargained for.

09:37.909 --> 09:39.009
All right, Jim.

09:39.077 --> 09:40.578
LOUIE: All right.
TONY: All right. That's it.

09:40.646 --> 09:42.480
I haven't had many fights
          in my life,

09:42.548 --> 09:44.415
but what I've had, I've won.

09:44.483 --> 09:46.516
I got my driver's license.

09:46.584 --> 09:48.319
That's right.
That's right.

09:48.387 --> 09:50.154
Yeah.

09:50.221 --> 09:53.023
I got my throat checked

09:53.091 --> 09:55.059
without a tongue depressor.

09:55.127 --> 09:58.028
And now I'm gonna get my three
     and a half million dollars!

09:58.096 --> 09:59.396
ELAINE:
Yay!
All right, Jim!

09:59.464 --> 10:01.399
Or fail to do so!

10:12.343 --> 10:13.611
MAN:
        <i>Please all rise.</i>

10:13.679 --> 10:15.712
<i>I prefer that hearings</i>
   <i>in my chamber be informal.</i>

10:15.780 --> 10:18.883
Mr. Ignatowski,
 I'd like to be frank with you.

10:18.951 --> 10:20.551
At this point,

10:20.619 --> 10:22.653
the papers submitted
  by your brother's attorney,

10:22.721 --> 10:24.922
Mr. Winslow,
   and the court investigator

10:24.990 --> 10:28.725
presents an extremely strong
   case for conservatorship.

10:28.793 --> 10:30.228
Uh, Your Honor,
                    I would like

10:30.295 --> 10:31.963
to address some
               of that evidence.

10:32.031 --> 10:34.065
You already have in the papers
  you've filed with the court.

10:34.133 --> 10:35.800
I'd like
   to talk to Mr. Ignatowski.

10:35.868 --> 10:38.168
How are you feeling
          today, Mr. Ignatowski?

10:38.236 --> 10:40.170
Uh, competent.

10:43.008 --> 10:44.742
May I elaborate on that,
          Your Honor?

10:44.810 --> 10:45.976
Jim

10:46.044 --> 10:48.713
is the wisest man I ever met.

10:49.915 --> 10:53.684
And I come from a
         very bright crowd.

10:55.153 --> 10:57.688
It is a privilege
          to know him.

10:59.157 --> 11:03.027
To put my feet up
after a hard day's work

11:03.094 --> 11:05.129
and listen to his wisdom.

11:06.364 --> 11:09.666
This man is so far ahead

11:09.734 --> 11:11.436
of the rest of us

11:11.503 --> 11:13.204
that most people

11:13.271 --> 11:16.440
often mistake his wisdom

11:16.508 --> 11:19.777
for burnt-out brain cells.

11:21.012 --> 11:23.113
Your Honor,
take it from me.

11:24.682 --> 11:29.186
This man is one
smart cookie.

11:29.254 --> 11:32.155
Boss, if you feel
             like that about me,

11:32.223 --> 11:33.924
who cares about the money?

11:33.992 --> 11:36.093
(mutters):
Shut up, you idiot!

11:37.896 --> 11:39.763
Thank you, Mr. De Palma.

11:44.703 --> 11:49.173
Your Honor, if you don't mind,
I'd like to trot out my big gun.

11:50.442 --> 11:51.709
Could Alex Reiger

11:51.777 --> 11:55.012
talk to you about
                  my competency?

11:55.080 --> 11:57.682
JUDGE:
     Certainly. I'd like to hear
   any arguments on your behalf.

11:57.749 --> 11:59.650
Uh... okay...

11:59.717 --> 12:03.020
Uh, Your Honor,
 in those papers on your desk,

12:03.088 --> 12:05.889
uh, I know you're gonna find
 there are some unusual things

12:05.957 --> 12:08.125
that Jim has done,
      but I can assure you

12:08.193 --> 12:10.394
there are acceptable reasons
        for all of them.

12:10.462 --> 12:11.595
Believe me.

12:11.663 --> 12:13.531
The court has to wonder
          why he lived

12:13.598 --> 12:17.167
in an abandoned building
      for, uh, five years.

12:18.270 --> 12:19.370
This isn't a trial!

12:19.437 --> 12:20.737
It's a witch hunt!

12:20.805 --> 12:22.006
ALEX:
Your Honor...

12:22.074 --> 12:23.674
Your Honor, when you look
     through those papers,

12:23.742 --> 12:25.509
you're going to find
   that the biggest argument

12:25.577 --> 12:28.045
against Jim's competency
    are that he is so decent

12:28.112 --> 12:30.681
that he invariably puts
     other people's welfare

12:30.749 --> 12:32.316
above his own.
TONY:
Yeah.

12:32.384 --> 12:36.087
This man cares absolutely
 nothing about material things.

12:36.154 --> 12:37.888
No matter what happens to him,

12:37.956 --> 12:40.257
he goes home every night
          a happy man.

12:40.325 --> 12:42.926
Now, I'm scared
 that we've all reached a point

12:42.994 --> 12:45.630
which means that someone
   like that is incompetent.

12:45.697 --> 12:48.265
And if we have, Your Honor,
then I'm scared

12:48.333 --> 12:50.868
and I'm sorry
not only for Jim,

12:50.936 --> 12:53.037
but for the whole
damn bunch of us.
             Hear, hear!

12:53.105 --> 12:56.106
(cheering and applause)

12:58.510 --> 13:01.311
You know, it's one
 of the problems in this court

13:01.379 --> 13:03.747
that they tend to rerun
     <i>Mr. Deeds Goes to Town</i>

13:03.815 --> 13:04.848
as often as they do.

13:11.223 --> 13:14.858
I'm sure we all have
      our idiosyncrasies.

13:14.926 --> 13:17.061
However, I'm afraid
         I must rule...

13:17.128 --> 13:19.263
Your Honor, before you
do that, one more thing.

13:19.331 --> 13:20.865
What is it?

13:20.932 --> 13:23.100
What about Howard Hughes?

13:23.168 --> 13:26.136
He was a man who had
billions of dollars

13:26.204 --> 13:27.738
and four-foot
    toenails.

13:27.806 --> 13:28.806
No, no, no,
no, no.

13:28.874 --> 13:30.308
Hey, forget Howard Hughes.

13:30.375 --> 13:32.309
What about
George Steinbrenner?
                  Yeah.

13:32.377 --> 13:35.345
Is a man competent...
is a man competent

13:35.413 --> 13:37.248
that would let Reggie Jackson
go to the Angels?

13:37.315 --> 13:38.482
That would go
through four managers

13:38.550 --> 13:39.517
in one year, Your Honor?

13:39.584 --> 13:41.886
Mis... Mr. Steinbrenner

13:41.954 --> 13:43.654
isn't the subject
       of this hearing...

13:43.722 --> 13:45.689
unfortunately.

13:47.359 --> 13:49.160
Could I say something?

13:49.227 --> 13:50.961
JUDGE:
                    If you wish.

13:51.029 --> 13:53.297
Do you wish me to stand?

13:53.364 --> 13:54.732
However you're most comfortable.

14:11.749 --> 14:14.118
That's as comfortable
         as I can get.

14:14.185 --> 14:15.886
What did you want to say?

14:15.954 --> 14:17.654
Nothing.

14:18.857 --> 14:21.825
Except that I wanted
    to invite everybody here

14:21.893 --> 14:25.429
to my victory party
      at the Pierre Hotel.

14:25.497 --> 14:28.332
We're going to have plenty
      of those big shrimp.

14:29.434 --> 14:32.436
Mr. Ignatowski...

14:32.503 --> 14:36.774
I must rule in favor
    of the conservatorship.

14:38.009 --> 14:39.943
Your Honor...

14:42.447 --> 14:46.984
My inheritance
is between me and my dad.

14:47.052 --> 14:48.686
No one else.

14:48.754 --> 14:50.387
Please...

14:50.455 --> 14:53.123
don't take that
away from me.

14:53.191 --> 14:54.825
No kidding around.

14:54.893 --> 14:58.095
Please.

14:58.163 --> 15:00.130
I'm sorry.

15:05.070 --> 15:07.405
(knock at door)

15:08.807 --> 15:10.340
Hi, Jim.

15:10.408 --> 15:12.042
Hi, Elaine.

15:12.110 --> 15:13.710
Do you want to be alone?

15:13.778 --> 15:16.147
Hell, no.

15:16.214 --> 15:18.316
Come on in.

15:19.450 --> 15:21.585
You know you have
               a trunk out here?

15:21.653 --> 15:23.287
Uh... yes.

15:23.354 --> 15:24.822
It's my dad's trunk.

15:24.889 --> 15:25.890
Oh.

15:25.957 --> 15:27.091
Some of his belongings.

15:27.158 --> 15:31.095
A couple of guys dropped
               it off yesterday.

15:31.162 --> 15:33.663
Make yourself
comfortable.

15:33.731 --> 15:36.433
Let me get you
something to drink.

15:36.501 --> 15:37.901
No, nothing, thank you.

15:37.969 --> 15:40.404
You know, you really
  should bring this trunk in.

15:40.472 --> 15:42.739
(stammering):
 Oh, no, I... I don't think so.

15:42.807 --> 15:45.008
Oh, no, come on, Jim,
   you've got to bring it in.

15:45.076 --> 15:46.444
Oh, I-I don't.
     Well, if you're not

15:46.511 --> 15:48.478
going to bring it in,
   I'm going to bring it in.

15:48.546 --> 15:50.747
I-I wish you wouldn't.

15:51.950 --> 15:55.553
Uh... uh,
please, don't.

15:56.654 --> 15:58.288
It's your
                 father's trunk.

15:58.356 --> 16:00.123
It's for you.
Well...
(clears throat)

16:00.191 --> 16:03.460
(grunting)
Uh, if you
insist on it,

16:03.528 --> 16:05.629
why don't you
put it over there

16:05.697 --> 16:07.564
in front
of the couch?

16:11.836 --> 16:14.238
Or, uh... right there is fine.

16:17.642 --> 16:20.310
So... well...

16:20.378 --> 16:22.713
what do you think
of my new place?

16:22.780 --> 16:24.481
Oh, yeah, I like it.

16:24.549 --> 16:25.715
I like it.

16:25.783 --> 16:27.884
Did you pick out, uh,
         the furniture yourself?

16:27.952 --> 16:29.253
No, no.

16:29.321 --> 16:31.622
No, a decorator friend
helped me.

16:37.929 --> 16:41.131
Y-You know...

16:41.199 --> 16:44.168
what really
makes me feel bad?

16:44.235 --> 16:45.636
What?

16:46.905 --> 16:49.540
Leaving that money

16:49.608 --> 16:53.877
was my dad's way
of saying,

16:53.945 --> 16:56.981
"You're okay
after all, Jim."

16:58.149 --> 17:01.351
And I never got the chance
to say back to him,

17:01.419 --> 17:03.787
"You're not so bad
yourself, big guy."

17:03.855 --> 17:05.388
Oh...

17:07.826 --> 17:10.627
Elaine, I...
I've changed my mind.

17:12.497 --> 17:14.531
I think I would like
to be alone.

17:14.598 --> 17:17.067
Are you sure?

17:17.135 --> 17:18.367
Yeah.

17:18.435 --> 17:20.069
Okay.

17:21.539 --> 17:22.873
Um...

17:22.941 --> 17:25.976
God, Jim...

17:26.044 --> 17:28.646
I mean, you know
you're not incompetent.

17:28.713 --> 17:30.381
Sure.

17:30.448 --> 17:33.517
If I was incompetent,

17:33.585 --> 17:35.519
would I feel this bad?

17:35.587 --> 17:36.653
(chuckles)

17:38.322 --> 17:40.290
No, you wouldn't.

17:40.358 --> 17:41.692
Oh...

17:43.061 --> 17:44.761
You promise you'll call me
if you want to talk?

17:44.829 --> 17:46.764
Oh, yeah.
Okay.

17:48.299 --> 17:50.601
Uh, would you
like the trunk?

17:50.669 --> 17:51.635
(chuckles)

17:51.702 --> 17:52.670
No, thanks.

17:52.737 --> 17:54.405
Good night.
    Good night.

17:58.343 --> 18:02.379
Why did Dad want me
      to have this stuff?

18:24.869 --> 18:27.404
My graduation picture.

18:28.773 --> 18:31.275
Gee, I didn't know Dad
           kept this.

18:33.478 --> 18:35.912
I didn't know I graduated.

18:49.427 --> 18:52.496
Dad's best suit.

19:19.791 --> 19:22.092
He was married in this.

19:27.565 --> 19:30.801
He was so proud

19:30.869 --> 19:35.572
that 25 years later
  he could still fit into it.

19:37.975 --> 19:39.476
(thud)

19:50.755 --> 19:53.290
Dad...

19:53.358 --> 19:56.360
I-I'm sorry I haven't cried.

19:58.763 --> 20:02.199
I don't know
      why I haven't cried.

20:03.434 --> 20:05.802
(sobbing)

20:05.870 --> 20:08.505
I feel awful
     that I haven't cried.

20:08.572 --> 20:10.040
(sobbing)

20:14.912 --> 20:18.381
Wait! I'm crying.

20:18.449 --> 20:21.718
But am I crying
       because I lost you

20:21.785 --> 20:24.221
or because I didn't cry?

20:26.624 --> 20:28.559
Wait, I stopped.

20:31.796 --> 20:33.396
(sobs):
       But I was crying.

20:33.464 --> 20:35.399
I didn't want to stop.

20:38.303 --> 20:40.236
I'm crying again.

20:44.241 --> 20:46.176
No, I stopped.

20:55.987 --> 20:59.256
I'm sorry we never got a chance
        to say good-bye.

21:01.426 --> 21:05.696
I don't remember if I told you
        that I love you.

21:07.432 --> 21:09.366
I do.

21:09.434 --> 21:11.735
Did you know that?

21:14.472 --> 21:19.143
I wish I could hear
         you answer me.

21:19.210 --> 21:22.980
I wish I could hear you
         say something.

21:23.048 --> 21:24.981
(rattling)

21:32.456 --> 21:34.391
You left me a tape?

21:54.945 --> 21:55.879
(click)

21:58.515 --> 22:01.451
(Stevie Wonder's "You Are
the Sunshine of My Life" plays)

22:05.923 --> 22:08.491
You like Stevie Wonder?

22:13.664 --> 22:18.502
¶ You are the sunshine
          of my life ¶

22:21.105 --> 22:26.509
¶ That's why I'll always
          be around ¶

22:28.445 --> 22:32.883
¶ You are the apple of my eye

22:35.686 --> 22:40.524
¶ Forever you'll stay
         in my heart ¶

22:42.960 --> 22:47.731
¶ I feel like this
       is the beginning ¶

22:49.968 --> 22:55.072
¶ Though I've loved you
     for a million years ¶

22:57.041 --> 23:01.911
¶ And if I thought
     our love was ending ¶

23:03.014 --> 23:05.114
¶ I'd find myself ¶

23:05.182 --> 23:08.652
¶ Drowning in my own tears

23:08.720 --> 23:11.321
¶ Whoa, whoa, whoa-oh-oh

23:11.388 --> 23:14.657
¶ You are the sunshine
          of my life ¶

23:14.725 --> 23:15.993
Oh!

23:16.060 --> 23:17.160
¶ Yeah
