01:01.644 --> 01:04.063
Here. It's water.

01:05.482 --> 01:08.485
I was gonna make tea,
but you don't have any.

01:11.738 --> 01:13.156
Go on, honey. Take a sip.

01:20.246 --> 01:22.082
Here they come. Here comes help.

01:26.544 --> 01:29.631
Hi, come in. I'm Judith.
I'm Marie's foster mom.

01:29.714 --> 01:31.591
Well, her former foster mom.

01:31.674 --> 01:33.927
She called me, and I came right over.

01:34.010 --> 01:35.010
I'm Officer Curran.

01:35.053 --> 01:37.722
Yes, thank you. Um... come in.

01:38.473 --> 01:40.433
- Thank you.
- She's right over here.

01:41.017 --> 01:42.894
Marie, I'm Officer Curran.

01:43.394 --> 01:44.479
I'm here to help you.

01:45.522 --> 01:47.899
Can you tell me what happened?

01:50.819 --> 01:51.945
I was raped.

01:53.071 --> 01:54.071
Okay.

01:55.156 --> 01:58.159
Can you tell me everything that happened?
Everything you remember.

01:58.910 --> 01:59.911
Um...

02:01.913 --> 02:03.164
Okay, I was...

02:04.749 --> 02:05.750
I was asleep.

02:05.834 --> 02:07.418
Do you know what time this was?

02:07.836 --> 02:08.836
It was late.

02:08.919 --> 02:11.923
I didn't...
I didn't go to sleep till four.

02:12.006 --> 02:14.008
So, you were up late. Were you out?

02:14.551 --> 02:15.927
No, I was here.

02:16.010 --> 02:19.097
I went to bed early, but then
Connor called, and we got to talk...

02:19.180 --> 02:21.057
Conner, is that a friend or boyfriend?

02:21.432 --> 02:23.768
- A friend.
- He used to be a boyfriend.

02:25.353 --> 02:26.896
And how long did you talk?

02:28.606 --> 02:29.482
A couple hours.

02:29.566 --> 02:31.776
- And you fell asleep.
- Yeah.

02:32.402 --> 02:33.403
What then?

02:40.410 --> 02:41.619
And then he raped me.

02:42.203 --> 02:44.455
Honey, you need to be more specific.

02:45.623 --> 02:48.209
Let's go back to when he was standing
by your bed.

02:48.668 --> 02:50.545
Did he say anything?

02:51.337 --> 02:53.673
He said if I screamed, he'd kill me.

03:03.600 --> 03:04.600
Police.

03:08.855 --> 03:10.481
I was asleep when she called.

03:10.899 --> 03:11.941
- What's your name?
- Ann.

03:12.317 --> 03:13.597
I dunno who they're looking for.

03:13.693 --> 03:16.070
She was really upset, so I called 911.

03:18.406 --> 03:21.784
Then he... he took this thing
out of his backpack

03:21.868 --> 03:23.286
and blindfolded me with it.

03:24.704 --> 03:25.704
Anything else?

03:26.956 --> 03:28.208
Yeah, um...

03:30.168 --> 03:31.169
...a condom.

03:32.754 --> 03:35.089
Then what happened
after he blindfolded you?

03:35.173 --> 03:37.425
He tied my hands. No, um...

03:39.260 --> 03:40.762
first, he tied my hands.

03:43.014 --> 03:44.015
Using what?

03:47.018 --> 03:48.686
<i>Shoelaces.</i>

03:48.978 --> 03:50.647
Also from the backpack?

03:52.398 --> 03:53.775
No, they were mine.

03:54.484 --> 03:56.069
And then what happened after that?

04:04.619 --> 04:05.619
And then?

04:13.920 --> 04:15.797
Did he also penetrate you anally?

04:17.757 --> 04:20.301
Was the penetration with his penis
or his fingers?

04:22.095 --> 04:23.346
Not his fingers.

04:25.974 --> 04:28.726
So, when it was over, what happened then?

04:30.603 --> 04:34.482
Then he... he put something on my stomach
and took a picture of it.

04:36.109 --> 04:37.568
You were still blindfolded?

04:37.652 --> 04:38.653
Mm-hm.

04:38.945 --> 04:40.745
How'd you know
he was taking a picture of you?

04:40.780 --> 04:41.864
Uh...

04:44.826 --> 04:47.829
Because there were... flashes.

04:49.455 --> 04:52.417
And he said if I told anybody,
that he'd post the picture.

04:53.710 --> 04:55.420
Did he say anything else?

04:57.255 --> 05:01.509
He... said that it wasn't as good
as how he pictured it in his head.

05:05.513 --> 05:07.348
Can you give me
a physical description of him?

05:07.432 --> 05:09.767
Um, he had on a mask, so I can't...

05:09.851 --> 05:13.271
Anything that you remember will help.
Was he short, tall?

05:14.689 --> 05:15.689
Tall.

05:15.898 --> 05:16.899
Race?

05:18.526 --> 05:20.278
- White.
- Eyes?

05:20.361 --> 05:21.654
I don't know, like...

05:22.280 --> 05:23.865
light, like, not...

05:24.824 --> 05:25.825
brown.

05:30.621 --> 05:32.540
He had a gray sweater.

05:34.542 --> 05:35.626
Excuse me.

05:36.085 --> 05:36.919
What's going on?

05:37.003 --> 05:38.129
Are you a resident?

05:38.212 --> 05:39.255
I work in there.

05:39.714 --> 05:40.757
Go ahead.

05:49.932 --> 05:51.309
That's Marie's.

05:51.392 --> 05:53.728
I helped her buy it. She has a set...

05:53.811 --> 05:56.356
- Uh, don't touch that. Sorry.
- Excuse me, miss.

05:56.439 --> 06:00.318
It's okay, I'm her counselor.
Are you okay? Come here.

06:04.197 --> 06:05.782
I'm so sorry this happened.

06:06.240 --> 06:08.326
I'm so, so, so sorry.

06:09.243 --> 06:11.037
- Hey, Judith.
- Hey, Becca.

06:18.961 --> 06:19.879
What do we got?

06:19.962 --> 06:23.466
Sir, I, uh, got an initial statement
from the victim.

06:23.549 --> 06:24.550
She's shaken up.

06:26.677 --> 06:29.138
Hi, Marie, I'm Detective Parker.
This is Detective Pruitt.

06:29.222 --> 06:30.932
We're in charge of the investigation.

06:31.641 --> 06:32.641
Um...

06:33.434 --> 06:36.514
I know this is hard, but I need to ask you
some questions about what happened.

06:38.815 --> 06:39.982
I already told him.

06:40.066 --> 06:41.234
Officer Curran.

06:41.317 --> 06:42.711
That's good. Curran's a good cop.

06:42.735 --> 06:46.906
But I'm lead detective on this, so I need
to hear what happened directly from you.

06:47.365 --> 06:48.366
Okay?

06:50.326 --> 06:51.887
- Okay.
- And my partners need to collect

06:51.911 --> 06:53.788
some evidence for the crime lab.

06:53.871 --> 06:54.871
Is that okay?

06:58.584 --> 06:59.710
Okay.

06:59.794 --> 07:02.004
Let's start at the beginning.

07:02.088 --> 07:05.341
Uh, last night before all this happened,
what were you doing?

07:05.425 --> 07:06.968
I... I was asleep.

07:07.385 --> 07:08.678
And before that?

07:11.389 --> 07:12.598
I was on the phone.

07:14.142 --> 07:15.143
Bye.

07:19.021 --> 07:20.857
You scream, I'll kill you.

07:26.404 --> 07:28.448
Sorry to interrupt.
Uh, just to be clear,

07:28.531 --> 07:30.908
the blindfold and the condom
were from his backpack,

07:30.992 --> 07:33.369
but the laces and the knife were yours?

07:34.745 --> 07:37.165
Got it. How long did the assault last?

07:46.549 --> 07:47.549
I don't know.

07:49.886 --> 07:51.286
And what happened when it was over?

07:55.433 --> 07:56.433
He left.

07:58.978 --> 08:00.897
Thank you, Marie. Um...

08:00.980 --> 08:03.542
I'll need to ask you some more questions
down at the station a little later.

08:03.566 --> 08:05.693
But right now,
you need to go to the hospital.

08:05.776 --> 08:08.863
They'll have to examine you.
You'll need a change of clothes.

08:09.906 --> 08:12.533
Uh, I'm sorry, ma'am,
you can't touch that right now.

08:14.744 --> 08:17.371
All right, just tell the investigators
what to get for you.

08:27.381 --> 08:29.821
Okay, you can turn around.

08:52.323 --> 08:54.325
Sorry, you're almost done.

09:01.290 --> 09:03.918
Again? I already told the cop.

09:04.710 --> 09:05.920
Two cops.

09:06.003 --> 09:07.713
I know, sorry.

09:08.381 --> 09:09.966
We need it for our records.

09:16.180 --> 09:17.348
I was asleep.

09:25.147 --> 09:26.482
No sign of forced entry.

09:26.857 --> 09:28.651
Gotta assume she left the door unlocked.

09:28.985 --> 09:30.278
Probably the sliding one.

09:31.445 --> 09:32.572
Body fluids?

09:32.655 --> 09:34.365
Collected two small stains
from the sheets.

09:34.448 --> 09:36.534
Also found a couple of loose hairs
on the floor.

09:36.617 --> 09:37.617
Prints?

09:37.827 --> 09:39.662
Lifted two partials off the slider.

09:39.745 --> 09:41.414
Not enough to enter in the AFIS.

09:42.748 --> 09:44.041
What'd the neighbors say?

09:44.458 --> 09:46.502
We're knocking on doors. So far, nothing.

09:50.214 --> 09:51.299
You should go.

09:52.216 --> 09:54.510
- I don't want to leave you, honey.
- No, go.

09:54.594 --> 09:56.887
It sucks when no one's there
to pick you up from school.

09:57.513 --> 09:58.513
Well...

10:03.060 --> 10:04.103
Okay.

10:06.188 --> 10:08.190
I'll check back in soon.

10:15.656 --> 10:17.658
It'll be a total of 12 swabs.

10:17.742 --> 10:18.909
Four from the vagina,

10:18.993 --> 10:21.579
four from the rectum,
and four from the area between.

10:21.871 --> 10:25.583
I'm also going to need to use a speculum
to collect your vaginal discharge.

10:25.666 --> 10:28.085
I have to ask if you've had
consensual intercourse

10:28.169 --> 10:29.712
in the last 72 hours.

10:30.379 --> 10:31.547
Mm-mm.

10:32.673 --> 10:33.673
Here we go.

10:40.014 --> 10:43.392
Now, I'm going to apply a dye
to your genital area.

10:43.476 --> 10:47.563
It shows the difference
between healthy tissue and injured tissue.

11:06.957 --> 11:08.834
Oh, not yet. Almost done.

11:08.918 --> 11:09.960
One more thing.

11:33.734 --> 11:35.486
<i>Your signature, here and here.</i>

11:37.947 --> 11:41.325
Thanks. These are your antibiotics
in case you've been exposed to any STDs.

11:41.409 --> 11:44.078
Four pills, you're gonna take 'em all
at the same time with water.

11:44.161 --> 11:47.039
This is your morning-after pill.
Just one, also with water.

11:48.082 --> 11:49.125
This is for you.

11:50.376 --> 11:52.253
Now, if you experience any
of the following:

11:52.336 --> 11:56.257
excessive bleeding, vaginal discharge,
shortness of breath, trouble swallowing,

11:56.340 --> 11:58.509
hives, thoughts of killing yourself...

11:58.592 --> 12:00.845
there's a number there
I listed it on your instructions.

12:12.314 --> 12:13.899
Hi, Marie, how you doing?

12:15.151 --> 12:16.485
I have a headache.

12:16.777 --> 12:17.862
I'm sorry.

12:18.738 --> 12:20.781
I'll try to get you out of here
as fast as I can.

12:22.658 --> 12:24.827
I just want to go over the incident
once more.

12:25.786 --> 12:27.246
But I already told you everything.

12:27.329 --> 12:28.873
I know, it's tough.

12:28.956 --> 12:33.461
A lot of times, as a victim talks
about a crime, new details come out.

12:33.878 --> 12:37.006
Uh, sometimes important ones.
I really want to find this guy.

12:37.089 --> 12:38.889
I want to make him pay
for what he did to you.

12:38.924 --> 12:41.218
And I want to make sure
he never does it to anyone else.

12:41.677 --> 12:42.720
So...

12:43.387 --> 12:45.347
I need all the details I can get.

12:46.974 --> 12:48.350
So, let's start at the beginning.

12:48.809 --> 12:50.478
All right, before the assault.

12:53.105 --> 12:55.274
It was late. I was in bed.

12:55.357 --> 12:57.109
I stayed up talking to Connor.

12:57.193 --> 12:59.195
And then at, like, four, I feel asleep.

13:02.531 --> 13:03.949
You scream, I'll kill you.

13:04.200 --> 13:06.118
How would you describe his voice?

13:09.663 --> 13:12.833
I don't... Uh, just normal.

13:12.917 --> 13:16.921
No accent, no defining characteristic?

13:18.339 --> 13:20.132
No, just a voice.

13:21.634 --> 13:22.468
Okay.

13:22.551 --> 13:23.594
What next?

13:28.641 --> 13:31.268
Hang on.
Did you say a hoodie or a sweater?

13:32.269 --> 13:34.021
Uh, a hoodie.

13:35.147 --> 13:36.147
You're sure?

13:36.357 --> 13:38.442
I mean, yeah.

13:39.026 --> 13:40.027
Okay.

13:41.904 --> 13:43.447
And the actual assault.

13:43.531 --> 13:47.451
Did he penetrate you vaginally,
anally, both?

13:49.245 --> 13:51.080
Um, vaginally.

14:53.267 --> 14:54.267
Hang on.

14:54.852 --> 14:55.936
Five minutes?

14:57.438 --> 14:59.607
Um, around that, yeah.

15:00.232 --> 15:02.359
Okay. And after that?

15:03.986 --> 15:05.029
He left.

15:06.238 --> 15:08.198
- Right away?
- No, not, like, right away.

15:08.282 --> 15:11.827
He took the blindfold off,
then packed up his stuff.

15:11.911 --> 15:13.746
The blindfold and the condom,

15:14.455 --> 15:16.957
but he left the knife and the shoelaces.

15:17.750 --> 15:19.209
- Mm.
- And then he left.

15:19.293 --> 15:20.293
Uh-huh.

15:21.587 --> 15:23.047
And what did you do then?

16:31.448 --> 16:35.244
So, the call to the neighbor,
that came after you talked to Judith?

16:35.327 --> 16:36.161
Yeah.

16:36.245 --> 16:37.871
And you called her because...?

16:39.206 --> 16:40.040
What?

16:40.124 --> 16:42.668
I'm just wondering why
you also called Amelia.

16:44.294 --> 16:46.922
Oh, she's... 'cause she's my...
she's my friend.

16:48.757 --> 16:49.757
Got it.

16:52.052 --> 16:54.596
Okay. Just two more things.

16:55.097 --> 16:57.975
Um, this is a medical release.

16:58.392 --> 17:00.561
By signing it,
you give us access to the information

17:00.644 --> 17:02.563
from the exam they did on you over
at Snohomish.

17:02.646 --> 17:05.107
And, uh, this is a witness statement.

17:05.190 --> 17:08.569
I just need you to write out
the statement you just told me.

17:14.282 --> 17:15.325
What the...

17:15.951 --> 17:17.703
So, the whole thing?

17:17.786 --> 17:20.414
Yeah, we need it in your own words.

17:25.752 --> 17:26.878
Sir, my...

17:27.378 --> 17:29.381
Sorry, I'm just really tired.

17:29.465 --> 17:32.259
And my head is just kinda killing me.

17:33.594 --> 17:34.595
Okay.

17:35.888 --> 17:37.306
Okay. Um...

17:38.098 --> 17:39.808
Sign the medical release now.

17:40.768 --> 17:42.102
Take the statement home.

17:42.644 --> 17:45.105
All right, just fill it out
in the next day or two...

17:45.564 --> 17:46.857
and get it back to me.

17:50.027 --> 17:51.027
Okay.

18:12.007 --> 18:13.217
I'm so sorry.

18:17.262 --> 18:18.555
We're all here for you.

18:31.068 --> 18:33.445
It's just really important
to lock your doors.

18:36.740 --> 18:38.200
You've gotta lock them.

18:40.661 --> 18:41.912
And your windows.

18:42.913 --> 18:44.039
You have to.

18:45.999 --> 18:47.835
You just have to keep yourself safe.

18:54.550 --> 18:56.343
You can stay as long as you want.

18:56.802 --> 18:59.596
Oh, Ty said I'll probably
get a new apartment tomorrow.

19:00.472 --> 19:01.557
So soon?

19:02.391 --> 19:04.601
I kinda like having you as a roommate.

19:06.520 --> 19:09.898
<i>♪...Something before this night ends ♪</i>

19:10.899 --> 19:15.529
<i>♪ Unfortunately, in my head ♪</i>

19:16.071 --> 19:18.866
- Are you calling Connor?
- No, my foster mom.

19:19.700 --> 19:23.036
Not the one that was here,
another one, Colleen.

19:23.537 --> 19:24.913
How many did you have?

19:25.706 --> 19:28.250
Oh, like... a million.

19:30.419 --> 19:31.753
Colleen was a good one.

19:37.301 --> 19:41.138
<i>♪ And all the eyes on me ♪</i>

19:43.724 --> 19:47.978
<i>♪ And all the eyes on me ♪</i>

19:48.061 --> 19:49.061
Hi.

19:50.147 --> 19:51.148
It's me.

20:08.916 --> 20:10.292
So, how's she doing?

20:11.710 --> 20:12.794
She was raped.

20:15.005 --> 20:17.174
Last night, in her apartment.
Some guy broke in.

20:17.257 --> 20:19.051
Jesus, seriously?

20:20.010 --> 20:21.762
How... how is she? Is she hurt?

20:56.505 --> 20:57.505
Hey.

21:01.468 --> 21:02.552
Not good.

21:37.754 --> 21:39.923
Oh, my gosh, honey.
I'm so sorry.

21:40.007 --> 21:41.425
Mm. It's okay.

21:41.508 --> 21:43.302
I didn't mean to scare you.
It wasn't locked.

21:43.385 --> 21:45.095
No, it's all right. Uh...

21:46.013 --> 21:47.264
I just, um...

21:48.265 --> 21:52.185
I'm just...
taking some stuff upstairs.

21:52.728 --> 21:54.396
- They got you a new place?
- So...

21:57.399 --> 21:58.400
Yeah.

21:59.067 --> 22:01.570
- Yeah, upstairs.
- Oh, that's good.

22:01.653 --> 22:02.653
Yeah.

22:03.030 --> 22:04.072
Um...

22:05.324 --> 22:07.492
Wait. Hey, hey, hold on a second.

22:07.576 --> 22:08.952
Hey, come here.

22:10.287 --> 22:11.496
Come here.

22:16.168 --> 22:17.252
How are you?

22:20.297 --> 22:21.214
Okay.

22:21.298 --> 22:24.009
You know it's okay to not be okay.

22:25.552 --> 22:26.970
I know, I just...

22:27.054 --> 22:30.682
I, uh, I've got to pack
and Ty loaned me all these bins,

22:30.766 --> 22:33.101
and he needs them back
by this afternoon, so...

22:36.855 --> 22:38.482
I'm trying to hurry and stuff.

22:43.612 --> 22:44.821
Marie.

22:45.864 --> 22:47.449
Marie, easy.

22:56.458 --> 22:58.085
Well, which do you like?

22:59.169 --> 23:00.212
Uh...

23:00.587 --> 23:02.422
I'm looking for the ones that I had.

23:03.882 --> 23:05.133
They were right here.

23:05.384 --> 23:07.636
Hmm, maybe they don't have 'em anymore.

23:09.388 --> 23:10.472
Um...

23:15.018 --> 23:16.645
Hi, excuse me, um...

23:16.895 --> 23:19.940
do you know where the green sheets
with the little daisies are?

23:20.023 --> 23:21.316
They were just here.

23:22.275 --> 23:23.693
Everything we have is on the floor.

23:23.777 --> 23:26.279
Really? You had tons of them,
like, three months ago.

23:26.363 --> 23:28.240
Can you just go check in the back?

23:28.907 --> 23:30.700
Honey, she said
everything they have is out.

23:30.784 --> 23:33.036
- It is.
- Well, that's what they say at my store,

23:33.120 --> 23:35.539
but sometimes there's one or two
of something left.

23:35.622 --> 23:38.708
It's not enough to put on display,
so the manager just sticks it in the back.

23:38.792 --> 23:39.793
We don't do that.

23:39.876 --> 23:42.814
- Let's just pick another set of sheets.
- I don't really want another set.

23:42.838 --> 23:46.258
- I want my set. I want the set that I had.
- Well, they don't have them.

23:46.675 --> 23:47.717
Well, they might.

23:48.343 --> 23:51.012
- In back. I'm just asking you to check.
- I know what's there.

23:51.096 --> 23:52.681
I'm back there all the time.

23:52.764 --> 23:54.933
The only thing back there
is more of what's out here.

23:55.016 --> 23:58.854
- So you're not even gonna look?
- Marie, you're being unreasonable.

23:58.937 --> 23:59.938
I am?

24:00.480 --> 24:01.480
What about her?

24:01.690 --> 24:03.442
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

24:03.817 --> 24:05.610
Seriously, you're siding with her
right now?

24:05.694 --> 24:09.072
I'm not siding with anyone. Let's just
chose some sheets and get outta here.

24:09.156 --> 24:12.200
I don't want these. I want my sheets.

24:12.284 --> 24:14.035
After what happened on them?
If I were you,

24:14.119 --> 24:16.746
- I'd never wanna see those sheets again.
- Well, you're not me!

24:44.900 --> 24:47.068
Marie, come on. Your shoes.

24:47.694 --> 24:48.695
It's fine.

24:49.571 --> 24:50.697
Honey, it's brand new.

24:50.780 --> 24:51.948
It's fine.

24:57.496 --> 24:59.498
Marie, it's Ty.

24:59.581 --> 25:01.500
Oh. Come in.

25:02.042 --> 25:03.543
- Hey, Colleen.
- Hi, Ty.

25:06.046 --> 25:07.339
How you doing, Marie?

25:08.006 --> 25:10.342
Good. Look, I'm all moved in.

25:11.051 --> 25:12.636
Marie, come on. Get up.

25:17.098 --> 25:19.601
You, uh, need anything else right now?

25:20.143 --> 25:22.562
Mm. No, I'm good. Thanks.

25:23.230 --> 25:25.482
Okay. If that changes,
you know where to find me.

25:25.565 --> 25:27.192
Okay, cool. Thanks.

25:29.152 --> 25:30.570
- Thanks, Ty.
- You bet.

25:32.155 --> 25:33.448
Marie.

25:38.328 --> 25:39.371
Honey.

25:40.455 --> 25:42.707
What can I do for you? What do you need?

25:42.791 --> 25:44.042
Nothing, I'm good.

25:44.960 --> 25:46.044
Sweetie.

25:47.754 --> 25:50.173
What happened to you,
it's a very big deal.

25:50.465 --> 25:53.385
I just want to be sure that
you're getting the support you need.

25:53.468 --> 25:55.929
I... kinda just wanna put
all this stuff away.

25:58.306 --> 25:59.626
So you don't wanna talk about it?

25:59.683 --> 26:01.893
No, I'll talk about anything.
I just wanna...

26:02.352 --> 26:04.020
I just kinda wanna get this done.

26:13.196 --> 26:14.239
All right.

26:23.790 --> 26:25.667
You call me if you need anything, okay?

26:25.750 --> 26:26.876
Okay, will do.

26:45.770 --> 26:47.647
Hey, Judith, it's me.

26:47.939 --> 26:50.108
Yeah, I'm just leaving her place now.

26:51.651 --> 26:55.071
Honestly, I have no idea how she is.

26:55.488 --> 26:56.615
She seemed...

26:57.407 --> 26:58.867
I don't know, fine.

26:59.534 --> 27:01.870
Like... like nothing had happened.

27:02.245 --> 27:05.290
It was weird that I was even
visiting her or something.

27:06.666 --> 27:10.670
- Oh, Barlow. I need a copy of a DCFS file.
- Yeah.

27:11.421 --> 27:13.702
It's for the victim of that sexual assault
at the Oakdale.

27:14.090 --> 27:15.675
- Got it. I'm on it.
- Thank you.

27:35.445 --> 27:36.445
Parker.

27:38.531 --> 27:39.741
Right, sure.

27:40.825 --> 27:42.619
How, uh... How you doing today?

27:44.704 --> 27:46.915
Would it be okay
if this stayed between us?

27:47.999 --> 27:51.211
- You don't want me to take notes?
- I'd rather it be in confidence.

27:51.294 --> 27:53.254
I don't want it getting back to Marie.

27:54.547 --> 27:56.675
Sure, I can do that.

27:58.259 --> 27:59.678
I love her, I do.

28:00.387 --> 28:03.098
She was with me the last two years.

28:03.181 --> 28:05.725
- She came here from Colleen's.
- Who's Colleen?

28:05.809 --> 28:06.935
Another foster mom.

28:07.185 --> 28:11.064
Marie was with Colleen for a couple
of weeks before she came to me.

28:11.815 --> 28:14.734
Isn't that kind of, um, a short stint?

28:14.818 --> 28:18.113
It was an emergency thing.
The home Marie was in before was...

28:18.988 --> 28:21.741
Well... they had to get her out of there.

28:21.991 --> 28:23.159
So, she went to Colleen's,

28:23.243 --> 28:26.121
but Colleen had a full house,
so she couldn't keep her long-term.

28:26.204 --> 28:27.747
- So, she came to you.
- Right.

28:27.831 --> 28:30.041
And she was my first foster child.

28:30.125 --> 28:32.293
I thought
they were gonna give me an infant.

28:32.377 --> 28:34.379
I had a crib and everything.

28:34.462 --> 28:36.631
And then this 16-year-old shows up.

28:36.715 --> 28:37.966
Must have been a surprise.

28:38.049 --> 28:40.593
Oh, I was fine with it. I love teenagers.

28:41.136 --> 28:44.514
I work at a high school
in the principal's office, so...

28:45.265 --> 28:47.726
I see a lot of them all day long.

28:47.809 --> 28:48.809
Got it.

28:49.144 --> 28:50.395
So, you know,

28:51.104 --> 28:54.399
her behaviors, what she was going through,
it was all pretty familiar.

28:54.482 --> 28:56.943
Well, it must have made it, uh, easier.

28:57.026 --> 28:58.862
For me, I don't know if it did for her.

28:58.945 --> 29:00.447
I... I hope it did.

29:02.115 --> 29:06.244
My point is, she's had a hard life.

29:06.327 --> 29:08.872
And not just the home she came from.

29:08.955 --> 29:09.955
But...

29:10.582 --> 29:11.958
some of the foster homes too.

29:12.041 --> 29:15.336
Has she been in situations
you'd call, um...

29:16.254 --> 29:17.422
abusive?

29:17.505 --> 29:19.215
Some, yeah.

29:20.675 --> 29:25.221
And that makes for
a very complicated young woman.

29:25.680 --> 29:28.600
Then you add this move,
being on her own for the first time.

29:28.850 --> 29:30.310
How long ago did she move out?

29:30.393 --> 29:31.770
About six months ago.

29:31.853 --> 29:34.022
And the transition's been hard?

29:34.105 --> 29:37.442
It's change. And change is stressful.
So, yeah.

29:38.193 --> 29:39.986
She has been a little needier.

29:40.069 --> 29:42.363
A little more acting out.

29:43.364 --> 29:44.741
Acting out how?

29:48.036 --> 29:51.664
It's got one of those deals
with the hotel and rent.

29:54.250 --> 29:56.169
That's inappropriate. Marie!

29:56.920 --> 29:58.171
Marie!

30:00.298 --> 30:01.841
Honey, settle down.

30:03.760 --> 30:05.011
Marie, that's enough.

30:05.428 --> 30:06.429
Marie.

30:06.513 --> 30:09.265
Hey, hey. Get off the table! Marie!

30:09.349 --> 30:11.768
Marie, there are children present. Enough!

30:13.770 --> 30:15.480
- Off the table. Right now!
- What?

30:15.563 --> 30:16.791
- Right now!
- Why do I have to...

30:16.815 --> 30:20.610
Just a whole lot of what I call
look-at-me behavior.

30:21.152 --> 30:24.656
<i>♪...birthday to you ♪</i>

30:28.535 --> 30:30.119
It's okay, honey.

30:30.662 --> 30:33.081
And overly sensitive overly contrary.

30:33.873 --> 30:36.543
All normal, given the circumstances.

30:36.626 --> 30:39.045
Yeah, sure, it's sounds like, uh,
a big change.

30:39.128 --> 30:41.089
I didn't think she was ready for it.

30:41.172 --> 30:45.301
- But she insisted, so I supported her.
- Right.

30:45.635 --> 30:48.930
So, anyway, yesterday morning
she called and told me what happened.

30:49.013 --> 30:50.431
- The rape.
- Yes.

30:50.932 --> 30:53.309
And I was just horrified.

30:53.810 --> 30:55.311
Angry, upset, worried...

30:55.395 --> 30:56.229
all of it.

30:56.312 --> 30:58.648
I went straight over there,
right away, and...

31:03.444 --> 31:06.114
I don't know. The whole thing just felt...

31:07.991 --> 31:08.991
off.

31:10.785 --> 31:12.370
Off, how?

31:12.453 --> 31:13.872
Just not right.

31:13.955 --> 31:17.333
How she was acting and re-acting.
Well, you saw her.

31:17.792 --> 31:20.670
She was detached, I guess.

31:20.753 --> 31:24.632
I think there's a range of reactions
to this kind of thing.

31:24.716 --> 31:26.843
- I know, believe me.
- Hmm.

31:26.926 --> 31:30.388
I have my own experience with it.

31:30.847 --> 31:32.223
Your own experience?

31:32.640 --> 31:36.185
I was sexually assaulted in my 20s.

31:36.269 --> 31:39.188
A guy I was dating.

31:39.272 --> 31:40.690
- I'm sorry.
- Thank you.

31:41.399 --> 31:43.568
My point is, I know about this.

31:43.651 --> 31:45.731
And given the way she was acting
and everything else,

31:45.778 --> 31:48.406
I don't know, it just all felt...

31:49.657 --> 31:51.993
- Off.
- And then those weird details.

31:52.076 --> 31:54.579
He brought a blindfold
but nothing to tie her with.

31:54.662 --> 31:56.456
Would a shoelace even hold her?

31:56.956 --> 31:59.584
And then that thing about him
taking the picture.

32:00.919 --> 32:02.503
- What... what about it?
- Well...

32:02.795 --> 32:04.005
just hypothetically.

32:04.797 --> 32:07.592
Say she's gotten herself into a situation
with some boy.

32:07.967 --> 32:12.263
And there is a compromising picture
out there, or she thinks there might be.

32:13.264 --> 32:14.682
Are you saying

32:15.308 --> 32:17.060
you think Marie

32:17.894 --> 32:18.978
made up the attack?

32:19.062 --> 32:22.398
I am not drawing any conclusions.
I just...

32:25.276 --> 32:27.570
I woke up this morning with all this stuff

32:28.154 --> 32:29.656
spinning around in my head,

32:29.739 --> 32:34.285
and I thought you guys
should have the whole picture.

32:34.661 --> 32:36.037
The context.

32:37.413 --> 32:38.623
I might not have even called,

32:38.706 --> 32:42.085
but then I talked to Colleen, and she said
she was feeling weird about it too.

32:42.168 --> 32:44.462
So, you both have some doubts
about Marie's story?

32:44.545 --> 32:45.713
Not doubts.

32:45.797 --> 32:49.300
I just thought since I had this...
feeling...

32:52.220 --> 32:56.641
maybe I had an obligation
to share it with you.

33:19.122 --> 33:20.123
Can I go now?

33:28.214 --> 33:29.924
Sure. Here, I'll walk you out.

33:32.677 --> 33:35.346
Let me ask you one thing,
so I'm sure I understand.

33:35.888 --> 33:41.060
Uh, in your statement you wrote
that you tried calling Connor,

33:42.145 --> 33:43.479
then called Judith,

33:44.647 --> 33:46.107
then cut yourself free.

33:46.482 --> 33:47.483
Yeah.

33:49.027 --> 33:50.111
In that order.

33:50.194 --> 33:51.194
Yeah.

33:53.614 --> 33:55.199
All right, thanks again, Marie.

33:55.950 --> 33:57.035
You're welcome.

34:04.584 --> 34:07.003
<i>She told us
you were the first person she called</i>

34:07.086 --> 34:08.212
<i>after the attack.</i>

34:08.670 --> 34:10.882
Yeah, she told me that too. I felt so bad.

34:11.799 --> 34:14.594
I didn't hear it.
I don't sleep with my phone in my room.

34:14.677 --> 34:16.721
- So, you two are close?
- Yeah.

34:17.929 --> 34:19.389
Friends, more than friends?

34:19.974 --> 34:20.808
Friends.

34:20.891 --> 34:23.936
We... We used to date, but...

34:24.020 --> 34:27.523
Are you and she sexually active?

34:28.107 --> 34:29.108
Um...

34:29.692 --> 34:31.694
Not... No, not, not... No.

34:33.029 --> 34:34.280
When she called,

34:34.822 --> 34:37.199
the morning of the assault,
did she leave a message?

34:39.409 --> 34:40.536
Mm-mm.

34:41.411 --> 34:44.123
- She just hung up.
- Can I confirm that on your call log?

34:45.333 --> 34:47.001
Oh, uh, sure.

34:53.091 --> 34:54.091
Here it is.

34:54.132 --> 34:55.132
Thanks.

34:55.842 --> 34:59.055
And then, uh, when was it
you finally talked to her?

34:59.138 --> 35:00.681
She called that night.

35:01.599 --> 35:02.600
Um...

35:04.852 --> 35:06.020
10:48.

35:07.563 --> 35:08.606
And what did she tell you?

35:10.858 --> 35:13.069
That, um, she had been raped.

35:13.152 --> 35:14.821
And did she give you any specifics?

35:14.904 --> 35:18.116
Yeah. She said that she woke up,

35:18.199 --> 35:21.202
and a man was there with a knife.

35:21.285 --> 35:23.079
Did she describe him physically?

35:24.539 --> 35:25.539
Uh-uh.

35:25.957 --> 35:27.542
But I guess after the, um...

35:28.626 --> 35:29.626
the rape...

35:30.002 --> 35:32.296
um, she said he left.

35:33.256 --> 35:35.049
Did she say what happened next?

35:35.133 --> 35:37.593
Yeah. I guess she was still, uh...

35:38.302 --> 35:39.637
um, tied up.

35:39.971 --> 35:42.431
So, she dialed the phone with her toes.

35:43.724 --> 35:44.767
With her toes?

35:47.937 --> 35:49.063
You sure about that?

35:50.565 --> 35:52.483
I mean, yeah, that's what she said.

35:53.734 --> 35:55.236
Dialing with your toes.

35:55.945 --> 35:58.990
Not really a detail
you'd be inclined to forget, you know?

35:59.073 --> 36:01.033
The hard evidence we have:

36:01.117 --> 36:03.786
the shoelaces are from her shoes,
the knife's from her kitchen.

36:03.870 --> 36:05.371
No sign of forced entry.

36:05.746 --> 36:07.331
No identifiable prints.

36:07.415 --> 36:08.416
No body fluids.

36:08.499 --> 36:11.335
Hey, Detective, here's that
Child and Family Services file.

36:11.419 --> 36:12.920
Uh, great. Thank you.

36:13.004 --> 36:14.004
Is that hers?

36:14.297 --> 36:15.298
Yeah.

36:17.758 --> 36:18.801
Aw, man.

36:29.395 --> 36:30.395
Jesus.

36:35.943 --> 36:37.069
Marie?

36:40.323 --> 36:41.323
Marie!

36:42.116 --> 36:43.326
What are you doing?

36:43.868 --> 36:45.870
<i>Customer needs assistance.</i>

36:45.953 --> 36:48.956
- Um...
- That's cookware. These are vacuums.

36:51.709 --> 36:55.129
I'm sorry. Uh, shoot.
Wh... where do these go again?

36:55.213 --> 36:57.256
Forget it. Rami.

37:10.102 --> 37:11.102
Hello?

37:11.354 --> 37:13.064
<i>Marie, it's Detective Parker.</i>

37:15.566 --> 37:16.734
Oh, hi.

37:17.235 --> 37:19.570
<i>Listen, I was wondering
if we could meet again.</i>

37:22.531 --> 37:23.531
Why?

37:25.284 --> 37:26.369
Am I in trouble?

37:33.834 --> 37:34.835
What?

37:34.919 --> 37:36.963
She asked if she was in trouble.

37:37.755 --> 37:38.589
Hmm.

37:38.673 --> 37:42.260
In my experience, when someone asks,
"Am I in trouble?"

37:42.343 --> 37:43.343
Yeah.

37:43.761 --> 37:45.137
They usually are.

37:47.265 --> 37:49.183
Okay, I'm gonna cut to the chase.

37:49.267 --> 37:52.561
I found some inconsistencies
in your statements

37:52.645 --> 37:54.522
and those of other witnesses.

37:57.483 --> 38:00.278
I... I don't know anything about that.

38:00.361 --> 38:03.656
How about you walk me through it again.
Tell me exactly how the assault happened.

38:04.115 --> 38:06.075
- Again?
- One more time, yes.

38:09.829 --> 38:11.414
Okay, I...

38:12.415 --> 38:14.166
was in bed, asleep.

38:21.173 --> 38:26.137
Marie, I'd like to back up a little
and talk about what came before all this.

38:27.471 --> 38:29.974
DCFS shared your file with us.

38:32.143 --> 38:35.354
- Why?
- We wanted a clear picture of who you are

38:36.063 --> 38:38.983
beyond this assault, as a person.

38:41.402 --> 38:42.402
Oh.

38:42.987 --> 38:44.739
You've been through a lot.

38:45.156 --> 38:46.907
You're a real survivor, aren't ya?

38:47.408 --> 38:48.993
I mean, no dad, uh...

38:49.660 --> 38:52.621
unreliable mom
with not-so-nice boyfriends.

38:52.705 --> 38:56.292
Then foster care,
which wasn't always much better, I'm sure.

38:56.375 --> 38:58.711
Sometimes... sometimes it was good.

38:58.794 --> 39:02.465
My point is... you've made it through
some very difficult stuff.

39:02.548 --> 39:05.676
I don't really like to think about that.
I just try to be as...

39:07.762 --> 39:08.929
happy as I can be.

39:09.013 --> 39:11.766
- And as happy as possible, so...
- Sure, I get that.

39:11.849 --> 39:12.849
So, help us out.

39:13.434 --> 39:17.063
There are inconsistencies in your story.

39:18.272 --> 39:20.941
I mean, the dialing alone,
we have four different versions:

39:21.025 --> 39:24.028
tied, untied, with your hands,
with your toes...

39:24.111 --> 39:25.154
I dialed with my hands.

39:25.237 --> 39:27.037
Then why'd you tell Connor
you used your toes?

39:27.073 --> 39:28.074
I don't...

39:29.992 --> 39:31.035
Maybe I did.

39:31.118 --> 39:32.918
- You just told us you didn't.
- Well, it's...

39:34.121 --> 39:35.121
What?

39:35.373 --> 39:36.415
I don't...

39:37.833 --> 39:39.210
It's... it's confusing.

39:39.293 --> 39:40.293
For us too.

39:40.544 --> 39:42.213
And we're not the only ones.

39:45.633 --> 39:46.550
W... what do you mean?

39:46.634 --> 39:51.013
There are other people who don't know
that what you told us about the rape...

39:52.098 --> 39:53.599
that it's the truth.

39:55.434 --> 39:57.645
- Who?
- Well, Judith for one.

39:57.728 --> 39:58.771
She said that?

39:58.854 --> 40:00.564
And Connor's statement.

40:01.399 --> 40:02.441
What... what about it?

40:02.525 --> 40:04.610
It's also inconsistent with yours.

40:04.693 --> 40:07.363
So, he knows the version you told him.

40:08.197 --> 40:10.077
And then he finds out
it's not what you told us.

40:10.116 --> 40:12.910
It makes it very hard for him
to believe you too.

40:12.993 --> 40:14.745
He said that he didn't believe me?

40:15.371 --> 40:17.540
I don't... Wh... why would he...
why would he say that?

40:17.623 --> 40:19.017
And then there's the crime scene.

40:19.041 --> 40:21.210
I mean, we couldn't find
any physical evidence

40:21.293 --> 40:23.963
there was anyone else
in your apartment that night.

40:24.046 --> 40:25.714
But there was.

40:25.798 --> 40:30.094
Marie, I want to be really clear
about something.

40:30.469 --> 40:32.721
We don't think you're a bad person.

40:32.805 --> 40:33.931
Absolutely not.

40:34.014 --> 40:37.560
And I also don't think this was some
big, thought-out thing,

40:37.643 --> 40:41.856
but given the inconsistencies
in your story and the lack of evidence,

40:41.939 --> 40:45.192
this is becoming a puzzle
that is hard for us to piece together.

40:45.276 --> 40:46.277
Right, so...

40:47.236 --> 40:50.739
I'm gonna tell you a version
that does fit together.

40:51.157 --> 40:52.157
Okay?

40:52.783 --> 40:55.327
A young woman,
been through a ton of bad stuff,

40:55.411 --> 40:57.288
on her own for the first time,

40:57.371 --> 40:59.248
just broke up with her boyfriend,

40:59.874 --> 41:02.251
feeling isolated, lonely,

41:02.751 --> 41:03.751
might...

41:04.545 --> 41:06.005
on the spur of the moment,

41:06.755 --> 41:10.384
come up with something,
without thinking it through,

41:11.844 --> 41:14.472
that would get her the attention
she needs.

41:14.555 --> 41:18.017
'Cause you haven't gotten enough attention
in your life. I can see that.

41:19.810 --> 41:22.897
You haven't been cared for
or protected, and...

41:24.732 --> 41:26.192
that's not your fault.

41:27.401 --> 41:29.153
So, Marie...

41:30.446 --> 41:31.446
tell us.

41:31.739 --> 41:33.908
We need to know. It's our job.

41:34.950 --> 41:38.996
Is there really a rapist running around
that we should be looking for?

41:41.999 --> 41:43.042
Marie?

41:46.003 --> 41:48.803
Marie, we can't
leave here till you give us an answer.

41:54.470 --> 41:55.470
Say it.

42:05.773 --> 42:06.773
No.

42:07.441 --> 42:08.943
There was no rapist?

42:10.236 --> 42:11.946
No one came in your apartment?

42:12.738 --> 42:13.864
And the...

42:14.949 --> 42:17.243
shoelaces, the knife... you did that?

42:21.372 --> 42:22.372
Okay.

42:24.124 --> 42:25.376
Thank you, Marie.

42:26.126 --> 42:27.253
Can I go now?

42:27.962 --> 42:29.463
We need a statement.

42:30.589 --> 42:31.589
Right.

42:32.049 --> 42:33.049
Uh...

42:34.635 --> 42:37.054
Since your other statement's already
in the file,

42:37.137 --> 42:39.014
we need you to write a new one...

42:40.057 --> 42:41.892
with this new information.

42:42.935 --> 42:43.936
Okay?

42:48.357 --> 42:49.775
Here. Same deal.

42:49.858 --> 42:52.069
Fill it out with what you just told us,

42:52.152 --> 42:54.863
and then, yeah, you can go home.

43:11.589 --> 43:12.881
Well, that's that.

43:13.966 --> 43:15.801
- Jesus.
- Yeah.

43:20.389 --> 43:22.349
I tell ya, I'm glad we caught it early.

43:22.975 --> 43:25.603
Remember that case over
in King County last year?

43:25.686 --> 43:27.813
College student and the history professor?

43:28.355 --> 43:31.150
Guy spent a week in jail
before she admitted she made it up.

43:32.192 --> 43:33.360
Didn't he sue her?

43:33.944 --> 43:35.321
I think he did, yeah.

43:36.155 --> 43:37.239
I don't blame him.

43:39.033 --> 43:40.284
I feel for her though.

43:41.285 --> 43:44.121
I mean, Christ, feeding a little girl
dog food. Who does that?

43:44.747 --> 43:47.291
You can't take care of a kid,
use a fucking condom.

43:47.374 --> 43:49.376
- God.
- Simple.

43:52.713 --> 43:53.881
Change?

43:53.964 --> 43:55.591
Oh, God.

44:04.933 --> 44:05.934
There you go.

44:07.645 --> 44:08.896
You have a ride home?

44:09.938 --> 44:11.315
I can take the bus.

44:11.982 --> 44:13.734
You sure? We can give you a lift.

44:13.817 --> 44:14.817
No, that's okay.

44:15.027 --> 44:16.945
- I can have these?
- Yeah, all yours.

44:19.615 --> 44:20.449
Hang on.

44:21.575 --> 44:22.951
What is this?

44:23.035 --> 44:24.870
This is not what you just said.

44:26.246 --> 44:28.582
"I dreamed that I was raped.

44:28.666 --> 44:32.628
When I woke up, it felt so real,
I believed that it had happened."

44:33.545 --> 44:34.545
Marie,

44:34.880 --> 44:36.048
what's going on?

44:36.548 --> 44:38.926
You just said there was no rape.

44:39.968 --> 44:41.261
You just said that.

44:43.347 --> 44:44.181
Sit down.

44:44.264 --> 44:45.557
Come on, sit back down.

44:50.521 --> 44:52.022
Let me explain something.

44:52.481 --> 44:55.401
Our job, mine and Detective Parker's,

44:56.860 --> 44:58.821
is to protect the public.

44:59.363 --> 45:01.448
That's it, that's the whole gig.

45:01.532 --> 45:03.367
Time in here with a witness,

45:04.034 --> 45:06.370
that's time that we could be
out on the street,

45:06.870 --> 45:08.247
keeping people safe.

45:08.580 --> 45:12.042
Now, that's part of the job, it's fine.
We're happy to do it,

45:12.126 --> 45:14.920
as long as the time in here is valuable.

45:15.003 --> 45:17.089
If it's about something real.

45:17.172 --> 45:19.925
This is not a worthwhile use of our time.

45:20.300 --> 45:22.010
This is a waste of our time.

45:33.772 --> 45:35.649
I'm pretty positive that it happened.

45:35.733 --> 45:38.193
Pretty positive or positive?

45:39.236 --> 45:40.821
M... maybe I blocked it out.

45:43.073 --> 45:44.450
- Marie.
- Hmm.

45:44.533 --> 45:47.077
You're a smart
young woman, clearly.

45:47.161 --> 45:50.122
You must understand
the way you're handling this...

45:51.749 --> 45:54.501
You say one thing, you write another.

45:55.169 --> 45:57.713
There is a rapist, there isn't one.

45:58.464 --> 46:00.799
It's a dream, it's a blackout.

46:00.883 --> 46:03.927
You've told us four different versions.

46:04.011 --> 46:06.597
At this point,
regardless of what the truth is,

46:06.680 --> 46:11.727
the only thing we know for sure is
that you have told us at least three lies.

46:16.565 --> 46:18.275
What do you think should happen...

46:19.193 --> 46:20.527
to someone who would...

46:21.862 --> 46:23.906
lie about something like this?

46:28.911 --> 46:30.579
I should get counseling?

47:05.531 --> 47:06.532
Okay.

47:11.119 --> 47:12.246
Okay, what?

47:14.122 --> 47:15.958
Okay, I'll write the statement now.

47:38.272 --> 47:39.273
Marie?

47:40.357 --> 47:41.358
What are you doing?

47:41.692 --> 47:44.236
Careful. You're gonna scratch the do...

47:44.319 --> 47:45.821
Just wait a second, will you?

47:45.904 --> 47:47.239
I'll back the car out.

47:47.948 --> 47:49.324
Just let me help you.

47:49.867 --> 47:51.952
- Marie.
- Like you helped me with the police?

47:52.035 --> 47:53.161
What... what does that mean?

47:53.912 --> 47:55.247
What does that mean?

47:55.622 --> 47:58.417
I don't know what you were told
or what you heard,

47:58.500 --> 48:03.171
but I did not do...
I didn't do or say anything.

48:03.255 --> 48:04.089
- Let go.
- Listen.

48:04.172 --> 48:06.508
This sounds like a big miscommunication.

48:06.592 --> 48:09.720
I didn't tell the police anything
other than some background on you.

48:10.053 --> 48:12.681
I told them about where you'd been
and what you'd been through.

48:12.973 --> 48:14.308
That's it.

48:14.766 --> 48:17.394
I may have told them
you've been sensitive lately.

48:17.477 --> 48:19.146
But it's true, you have been.

48:19.438 --> 48:21.064
Now, don't do that.

48:21.148 --> 48:24.651
Don't pull a big disappearing act.
We are having a conversation here.

48:24.985 --> 48:26.236
Don't just abandon it.

48:26.570 --> 48:27.570
Marie!

48:27.863 --> 48:28.863
Marie.

48:46.423 --> 48:47.424
Marie.

48:48.800 --> 48:49.885
Could we talk a sec?

48:57.809 --> 48:58.977
I wasn't lying.

48:59.811 --> 49:01.063
What do you mean?

49:02.397 --> 49:04.274
I told the truth the first time.

49:04.358 --> 49:07.235
When you said you were raped?
You're saying that was true?

49:08.946 --> 49:12.157
- So why did you tell the police it wasn't?
- I don't know.

49:12.240 --> 49:15.160
I was really tired,
and they just kept pestering me.

49:15.243 --> 49:16.286
- Pestering?
- Yeah.

49:16.370 --> 49:18.789
Like, asking me the same question
over and over again.

49:18.872 --> 49:20.374
"How come your story doesn't add up?

49:20.457 --> 49:23.227
How come people don't believe you?
Is there really a rapist out there?"

49:23.251 --> 49:24.294
I just, I...

49:24.378 --> 49:26.463
I... I wanted to go home.

49:26.546 --> 49:29.758
If there is a rapist running around
and you've told the police there isn't,

49:29.841 --> 49:32.678
you need to go back
and clear that up, now.

49:32.761 --> 49:34.805
- But I gotta go to work.
- Marie.

49:35.263 --> 49:36.431
This is important.

49:40.102 --> 49:43.271
You wanna take back your statement,
taking back your statement.

49:45.816 --> 49:46.817
Yeah.

49:47.275 --> 49:49.403
All right, let's do this again.

49:55.158 --> 49:58.829
Detective Parker isn't in today.
This is Sergeant Rheinhart.

49:58.912 --> 50:00.414
How you doing, Marie?

50:01.373 --> 50:04.001
So, let's back up a little.

50:04.751 --> 50:06.586
Talk about what caused this turnaround.

50:06.878 --> 50:09.423
Did something happen last night
when you went home?

50:10.048 --> 50:12.426
Did... did they give you a hard time
about lying?

50:15.721 --> 50:16.721
- No.
- Really?

50:16.972 --> 50:20.559
'Cause those guys downstairs,
are they your counselors?

50:21.768 --> 50:23.311
- Yeah.
- Yeah, uh...

50:23.812 --> 50:25.897
they seemed kinda pissed off.

50:25.981 --> 50:27.399
And I get that.

50:27.482 --> 50:32.029
They put all this time and energy into
thinking this horrible thing happened.

50:32.112 --> 50:33.572
And then find out it didn't.

50:34.448 --> 50:35.449
I mean...

50:44.041 --> 50:46.043
I remember him on top of me.

50:49.755 --> 50:50.756
Marie...

50:53.050 --> 50:54.384
I know this is hard.

50:54.718 --> 50:56.094
And I'm sorry about that,

50:56.178 --> 50:59.181
but I have to remind you
of what's already happened.

51:00.015 --> 51:02.350
You already told us you lied.

51:02.434 --> 51:05.270
You already said you staged evidence.

51:05.604 --> 51:08.231
You swore to it. You signed your name.

51:08.315 --> 51:09.691
So, given that...

51:11.193 --> 51:12.861
how are we supposed to believe you now?

51:14.988 --> 51:18.241
I could...
I could take a lie detector test.

51:19.785 --> 51:21.661
Yeah, yeah... that's right.

51:22.788 --> 51:23.872
You could.

51:24.539 --> 51:25.832
That's an option.

51:26.458 --> 51:29.836
But you need to know,
if you take it and fail,

51:29.920 --> 51:32.464
that's called making a false statement.

51:33.090 --> 51:34.424
It's a crime.

51:35.342 --> 51:36.343
So...

51:37.594 --> 51:40.847
do you wanna go downstairs
for the polygraph?

51:40.931 --> 51:43.058
Or do you wanna just...

51:43.975 --> 51:47.104
clear this all up with us, in here?

51:47.395 --> 51:48.395
Um...

51:49.147 --> 51:50.148
maybe...

51:55.028 --> 51:56.446
maybe I was, um...

51:57.531 --> 51:58.573
hypnotized.

51:59.449 --> 52:02.786
You know what?
Fine, let's do the polygraph.

52:02.869 --> 52:05.622
Let's go. But here's the thing, Marie.

52:06.373 --> 52:07.624
The guy running it,

52:08.166 --> 52:10.043
he's not going to ask,

52:10.127 --> 52:13.839
"Were you hypnotized
into thinking you were raped?

52:14.506 --> 52:15.966
Did you dream a rape?"

52:16.383 --> 52:18.927
He's going to ask you one question.

52:19.427 --> 52:21.096
"Were you raped?"

52:21.179 --> 52:22.848
That's it.

52:23.306 --> 52:26.393
And if your answer turns out to be a lie,

52:26.476 --> 52:30.397
I have no choice but to arrest you
and put you in jail.

52:31.064 --> 52:32.399
Wait, why?

52:32.482 --> 52:34.882
Making a false statement
is a crime for a reason.

52:34.943 --> 52:38.113
It impedes our ability to do our job,
to keep the public safe.

52:38.196 --> 52:41.366
That's why we enforce it.
That's why we prosecute it.

52:42.826 --> 52:45.203
I also suspect
your living situation,

52:45.287 --> 52:47.956
with the counselors
and the stipends and all that...

52:48.039 --> 52:51.543
you lose all that
if you have a record, right?

52:52.627 --> 52:55.964
But, like I said,
if you want to do a polygraph,

52:56.047 --> 52:57.424
you're free to do one.

52:59.384 --> 53:01.136
You need to know the risks.

53:02.262 --> 53:03.388
But, yeah,

53:04.347 --> 53:06.057
the decision is yours.

53:20.280 --> 53:21.990
So, what's the story?

53:23.158 --> 53:24.158
Nope.

53:24.492 --> 53:25.577
Totally made up.

53:26.453 --> 53:29.664
Says she didn't think it would turn into
such a big thing.

53:30.457 --> 53:32.751
- So, we're gonna close the case.
- Right.

53:34.502 --> 53:36.421
Call me if you have any questions.

53:36.504 --> 53:37.672
Yeah, thank you.

53:47.807 --> 53:48.993
Why would you do that?

53:49.017 --> 53:50.936
Why would you freak us out like that?
That's...

53:51.019 --> 53:52.339
It's sick is what it is.

53:52.562 --> 53:55.041
- You're sick, you are.
- You knew how scared this would make us.

53:55.065 --> 53:57.609
Guys, let's try to put this in terms
of feelings.

53:57.692 --> 53:58.610
I'm feeling mad.

53:58.693 --> 53:59.945
- Betrayed.
- Disgusted.

54:00.028 --> 54:01.947
Angry, really, really angry.

54:04.366 --> 54:07.035
Marie, do you want to say anything?

54:35.021 --> 54:36.064
That's insane.

54:41.403 --> 54:42.404
- Amelia.
- No.

54:42.487 --> 54:43.822
Okay? Just, no.
