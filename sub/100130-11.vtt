WEBVTT

00:07.729 --> 00:09.924
Piper, have you
seen slides anywhere?

00:10.089 --> 00:12.000
By the TV.

00:12.809 --> 00:15.607
Thank God. I thought that I had lost
them. Jack would have killed me.

00:15.769 --> 00:17.964
- Jack?
- The boss is sending two employees

00:18.129 --> 00:21.121
with the best presentation to New York
for a conference, all expenses paid.

00:21.289 --> 00:23.359
And Jack and I are hoping
that he picks us.

00:23.529 --> 00:24.882
Are you gonna sleep with him?

00:25.049 --> 00:27.643
Piper, it is just a business trip.
That is all.

00:30.089 --> 00:34.002
- Who's the present for?
- Lisa Kruger's baby shower.

00:34.529 --> 00:36.121
- I forgot.
- I know.

00:36.289 --> 00:39.804
So did Phoebe.
But I'm making it from all of us.

00:40.449 --> 00:42.246
- What all is in here?
- Stuff.

00:42.409 --> 00:44.877
And I just knitted her
a little baby blanket. That's all.

00:45.729 --> 00:48.641
You knit. I didn't know that you knit.

00:48.849 --> 00:50.487
Yeah. I even had some
extra yarn left over,

00:50.649 --> 00:52.879
and I made her a little bear to match.
Kind of cute, huh?

00:54.809 --> 00:56.800
Hi. He's adorable.

00:56.969 --> 00:59.802
I guess this is really good
practice for you, huh?

00:59.969 --> 01:02.483
- What are you talking about?
- You, Dan, little Dan.

01:02.649 --> 01:04.001
Whoa, slow down.

01:04.169 --> 01:07.320
Dan is the one that has our
relationship on the fast track, not me.

01:07.489 --> 01:09.719
But don't get me wrong, he's...
He's great.

01:09.969 --> 01:11.960
But that doesn't mean
I'm ready to move in with him

01:12.129 --> 01:14.802
- or anything else of that nature.
- You know, I just hate guys

01:14.969 --> 01:17.244
that aren't afraid to commit,
they are so atypical.

01:17.409 --> 01:19.320
It's not funny, Prue. It's a problem.

01:19.689 --> 01:21.441
Piper, I don't really see
what the problem is.

01:21.609 --> 01:23.486
I mean, you and Dan
are great together,

01:23.649 --> 01:25.241
and you think that you love him, right?

01:26.569 --> 01:28.161
I think so. It's just,

01:28.329 --> 01:30.240
every time I feel I'm ready
to commit to him,

01:30.409 --> 01:32.764
I flash back to our little trip
to the future

01:32.929 --> 01:35.238
- and seeing me with Leo and the...
- Piper.

01:35.409 --> 01:38.162
Dan is here now, in the present.
That's all that matters.

01:38.729 --> 01:41.323
I know. I know.

01:41.489 --> 01:43.445
But I'm not ready
for a baby shower either.

01:45.000 --> 01:51.074
-= www.OpenSubtitles.org =-

01:52.049 --> 01:55.724
Come on, Morris, open your mind.
This can so work.

01:55.889 --> 01:58.722
Look, Phoebe, it's not that
I don't appreciate your offer.

01:58.889 --> 02:02.928
It's just my stock in this precinct
is not exactly blue-chip.

02:03.089 --> 02:04.886
The last thing I need
is for word to get out

02:05.049 --> 02:07.244
that I'm using a psychic
to solve my cases.

02:07.449 --> 02:08.643
So no one needs to know.

02:08.809 --> 02:10.878
You just give me the evidence,
I touch it,

02:11.049 --> 02:14.359
and if I get a flash,
then we're in business.

02:19.409 --> 02:21.047
Oh, my God.

02:21.209 --> 02:23.962
I see blood...

02:24.529 --> 02:26.167
...flesh.

02:26.529 --> 02:28.326
You had the sausage for breakfast,
didn't you?

02:28.489 --> 02:30.127
I hate sausage.

02:30.289 --> 02:31.404
It's a little joke.

02:31.889 --> 02:34.357
All right, people, move along,
nothing to see here.

02:38.569 --> 02:40.764
Who would bring a baby
to a police station?

02:40.929 --> 02:43.887
- It was abandoned. Now, look...
- Abandoned? That's awful.

02:44.049 --> 02:45.801
That's why they call it a crime.
Now, Phoebe...

02:45.969 --> 02:49.518
You know, they're really scaring him
waving that rattle in his face like that.

02:51.249 --> 02:55.208
Excuse me, officers.
Mind if I try this? Thanks.

02:55.529 --> 02:57.724
Thanks. We got it from here.

02:57.889 --> 03:00.449
It's okay, sweetie. It's okay.

03:00.609 --> 03:02.759
It's okay, Matthew.

03:02.969 --> 03:05.563
There you go. You're okay.

03:05.889 --> 03:08.483
See, I told you I could help you.

03:08.969 --> 03:11.483
All babies need is love.

03:12.169 --> 03:16.606
Hi. Oh, yeah. Big boy, huh?

03:26.849 --> 03:29.522
Phoebe, are you okay?

05:00.609 --> 05:03.407
So I can't figure out if the premonition
was the future or the past.

05:03.569 --> 05:05.321
But if it was the past,
it would make sense

05:05.489 --> 05:07.878
that they would abandon him
to try to save him.

05:08.049 --> 05:10.244
You know, I'm not really good
with these things.

05:10.449 --> 05:12.758
They're called babies,
and just do the rock-and-walk,

05:12.929 --> 05:14.965
he loves the rock-and-walk.

05:16.249 --> 05:19.002
- Are you sure it was a ghost?
- Yeah, I think I know ghosts by now.

05:19.209 --> 05:21.404
I just can't figure out
why a mean ghost

05:21.569 --> 05:23.321
would wanna hurt
that cute little baby.

05:23.489 --> 05:26.367
And how did you talk Darryl
into letting you take him home?

05:26.529 --> 05:28.520
I just told him about the premonition.

05:29.009 --> 05:31.318
Only problem is,
he says we have 24 hours

05:31.489 --> 05:33.844
before Social Services
starts asking questions.

05:34.009 --> 05:35.681
So, what are we supposed to do
with him now?

05:35.849 --> 05:38.966
Raise him in the ways of witchcraft?
Teach him how to fight ghosts?

05:39.129 --> 05:40.721
Okay, okay.
Maybe you should take him.

05:41.089 --> 05:43.444
Okay. Come here.

05:43.609 --> 05:46.407
It's okay. It's all right.

05:46.649 --> 05:52.804
There's a good baby.
There's a very good little baby. Okay.

05:53.609 --> 05:57.045
- Wow, you really are a natural at this.
- Yeah.

05:57.209 --> 05:59.564
I can't wait to have a baby
of my own someday.

06:00.089 --> 06:03.081
I'm beginning to think Dan
fell in love with the wrong sister.

06:04.369 --> 06:06.644
Nothing, never mind.

06:08.049 --> 06:11.121
Hi, sweetie.
Do you like bears? Lookie.

06:13.209 --> 06:16.201
Yeah. He doesn't like things
being waved in his face.

06:16.369 --> 06:19.247
- Obviously.
- Well, let's do him.

06:20.169 --> 06:23.878
All right, this better be good,
because my New York trip is at stake.

06:26.769 --> 06:27.918
We have a baby?

06:28.089 --> 06:29.807
Phoebe picked it up
at the police station.

06:30.089 --> 06:35.243
Okay, I thought that you were going
to go ask Darryl about a job, not a kid.

06:35.449 --> 06:39.761
I was. And I was trying, but then
this abandoned baby came in.

06:39.929 --> 06:41.282
- Abandoned?
- Yes.

06:41.449 --> 06:45.283
In a Eddie Bauer car seat
and a blanket lined in silk?

06:45.729 --> 06:48.243
Oh, no. You guys, I think
he's finally falling asleep.

06:48.409 --> 06:50.001
Okay, I don't get it.

06:50.169 --> 06:52.285
If the parents could afford
such expensive stuff,

06:52.449 --> 06:54.041
then how come
they couldn't keep the kid?

06:54.209 --> 06:56.165
I don't think that's
why he was abandoned.

06:56.329 --> 06:57.967
Oh, no.

06:59.769 --> 07:02.920
He's like a car alarm.
The smallest vibration

07:03.089 --> 07:05.728
just sets him off, and there's
nothing you can do to stop it.

07:05.889 --> 07:07.880
- She's got baby issues.
- I know.

07:08.049 --> 07:11.200
Look, okay, Phoebe had a vision
of a ghost chasing the baby.

07:11.369 --> 07:13.724
And a man carrying the baby,
probably his father.

07:13.889 --> 07:17.006
Darryl said I could stop by, and he'd
get a sketch artist to help me ID him.

07:17.329 --> 07:20.048
Good, because the only way to find out
why the ghost is after the baby

07:20.209 --> 07:21.801
is by finding out who he belongs to.

07:21.969 --> 07:23.607
- I better go.
- What?

07:23.769 --> 07:27.648
Yeah, I gotta get back to work.
Just keep me posted.

07:27.849 --> 07:31.046
Whoa, wait, you can't
leave me here alone with him.

07:31.209 --> 07:33.006
Piper, you're gonna be fine,
don't be afraid.

07:33.169 --> 07:35.763
- Yeah, just think of it as a test run.
- I don't need a test run.

07:35.929 --> 07:37.203
I remember when Phoebe
was a baby.

07:37.369 --> 07:38.882
And it was hard on Mom,
and endless.

07:39.049 --> 07:40.801
And with you dropping her
all the time...

07:40.969 --> 07:43.164
- What?
- Oh, moving on, what's the point?

07:43.329 --> 07:46.526
The point is we need things like
diapers and bottles and formula

07:46.689 --> 07:49.647
- and a million other things.
- I'll go shopping.

07:50.529 --> 07:52.087
And I'm gonna go see Morris.

07:52.249 --> 07:54.763
You're gonna be fine, okay?
Just do the rock-and-walk. Okay?

07:54.929 --> 07:57.523
You're gonna be fine. Bye.

08:15.569 --> 08:17.321
All right.

08:18.649 --> 08:20.480
Oh, God.

08:31.209 --> 08:33.200
- Prue.
- Jack.

08:33.369 --> 08:35.724
Hey. What are you doing here?

08:35.889 --> 08:37.561
Getting my ass kicked
by a 5-year-old.

08:37.729 --> 08:40.721
Hey, you little rug rat,
best two out of three. Come on.

08:40.889 --> 08:45.280
- So how did you find me?
- Your assistant told me.

08:45.449 --> 08:47.758
What she didn't tell me
is what the hell you're doing here.

08:47.929 --> 08:51.808
Oh, just a little bit
of a family emergency.

08:51.969 --> 08:55.325
- And you needed diapers?
- Yes, they're for my cousin.

08:55.489 --> 09:00.961
My baby cousin Matthew.
Just staying with us a day or so.

09:01.129 --> 09:02.881
And you'd be coming
back to work when?

09:03.049 --> 09:05.358
Right after I drop this stuff off.
And believe me,

09:05.529 --> 09:07.724
there will be no more interruptions
after today.

09:07.889 --> 09:09.402
Good. Because for a second there,

09:09.569 --> 09:12.481
I thought maybe you'd changed
your mind about going to New York.

09:12.649 --> 09:14.287
Okay, wait a second. Who has been

09:14.449 --> 09:17.759
working late for the past three nights
to get our presentation done?

09:17.929 --> 09:21.126
Yeah. Well, that's before I thought
we had a chance to win.

09:21.289 --> 09:25.282
So when you disappeared, I figured
that maybe you had second thoughts.

09:25.449 --> 09:27.599
No, I want to go to New York.

09:27.769 --> 09:32.001
And believe me, I would much rather
be at work right now

09:32.169 --> 09:37.527
than trying to figure out whether
to get aloe-lined or Velcro-tabbed

09:37.689 --> 09:42.080
or elastic-leg-cuff-thingy diapers.

09:43.009 --> 09:45.842
You wouldn't happen to know
anything about diapers, would you?

09:46.009 --> 09:48.682
Me? No.

09:48.849 --> 09:50.965
See, that would involve knowing
something about babies,

09:51.129 --> 09:54.360
which I know absolutely zero about.

09:54.689 --> 09:59.319
But what I do know something
about is the Big Apple.

09:59.689 --> 10:03.728
Specifically, romantic restaurants,

10:04.129 --> 10:07.121
hip clubs, secret getaways.

10:07.929 --> 10:12.764
Okay. Presentation's today at 3,
plane leaves tomorrow at 9.

10:14.769 --> 10:16.964
I got a kid to catch.

10:28.569 --> 10:29.922
This is called the jiggle.

10:30.089 --> 10:33.684
It gives the babies that nice, warm
moving-around-in-the-womb feeling.

10:33.849 --> 10:37.159
You're absolutely amazing.
I tried everything, and nothing worked.

10:37.329 --> 10:39.968
Well, it helps to come
from a big family.

10:40.129 --> 10:43.724
Once you've mastered the jiggle,
you'll be able to do...

10:44.569 --> 10:46.207
...the wave.

10:46.649 --> 10:49.800
- Wanna give it a try?
- No. Let's not mess with a good thing.

10:56.969 --> 10:58.641
You're staring.

10:59.609 --> 11:01.918
I like seeing you this way.

11:03.809 --> 11:08.121
You have no idea
how expensive having a baby is.

11:08.289 --> 11:12.202
So I'll tell you: $312.46, to be exact.

11:12.369 --> 11:13.518
No way.

11:13.689 --> 11:17.125
Well, your timing's perfect.
Cousin Matthew needs a change.

11:17.289 --> 11:19.041
- Okay, here.
- Okay.

11:20.289 --> 11:21.517
All right, here we go.

11:21.729 --> 11:23.606
- Oops-a-daisy.
- Hi.

11:32.169 --> 11:34.000
That is ripe.

11:34.169 --> 11:36.000
What does this kid live on,
wheatgrass?

11:36.169 --> 11:38.478
- I can change him.
- No, no, we got it.

11:39.009 --> 11:42.524
All right, I've got
hypoallergenic wipes,

11:42.689 --> 11:46.648
diaper-rash cream
and super-absorbent diapers.

11:46.809 --> 11:48.925
- What are we supposed to do with...?
- Just toss it.

11:49.089 --> 11:52.047
- All right.
- Don't forget to clean up under his...

11:57.169 --> 12:00.445
Okay, so maybe only one of us
should change him.

12:00.609 --> 12:02.565
- Be my guest.
- All right.

12:02.969 --> 12:04.766
On the count of three. Ready?

12:04.929 --> 12:08.285
One, two, three.

12:11.209 --> 12:13.359
Boys will be boys.

12:15.729 --> 12:16.923
Hi.

12:20.649 --> 12:23.038
It doesn't... It doesn't fit. Doesn't fit.

12:23.209 --> 12:25.279
Probably the wrong size.

12:25.449 --> 12:28.282
Okay, how was I supposed to know
what size to get?

12:28.969 --> 12:31.881
- Look, I got it.
- You got it?

12:32.049 --> 12:33.801
Oh, how nice.

12:34.329 --> 12:36.843
There we go. How's that?

12:37.009 --> 12:39.159
Wow, you're like MacGyver
with oestrogen.

12:39.329 --> 12:40.842
Thanks, I think.

12:41.009 --> 12:43.364
Actually, cloth diapers
are more environmentally friendly,

12:43.529 --> 12:45.008
but harder to use.

12:45.649 --> 12:48.607
There. Such a good boy.

12:49.409 --> 12:51.798
- Yes, he is.
- All right.

12:51.969 --> 12:54.358
If you want, I can pick up
the right size on the way home.

12:54.529 --> 12:56.759
- Thanks, that'd be great.
- Not a problem.

12:59.929 --> 13:01.442
See you tonight.

13:01.609 --> 13:02.962
Hi.

13:03.849 --> 13:06.522
- What?
- You know what is so weird?

13:06.689 --> 13:08.281
What? Why are you giving him to me?

13:08.449 --> 13:11.168
Because... Because I gotta go.

13:12.289 --> 13:13.927
That's twice. I'm counting.

13:15.009 --> 13:16.488
Hi.

13:17.449 --> 13:19.917
- Yeah, I'm off for a few days.
- Heading to the lake?

13:21.129 --> 13:23.597
I think his brows should be
a bit more arched

13:23.769 --> 13:25.487
and his hair a little lighter.

13:26.849 --> 13:28.077
Yeah, that's better.

13:28.529 --> 13:31.282
And his nose is bigger, wider.

13:32.849 --> 13:34.521
So we looking for a murder suspect?

13:34.689 --> 13:36.645
Just do me a favour, Hernandez.
No questions.

13:36.809 --> 13:39.369
Need to know what to do with him
when I'm done with the sketch.

13:39.529 --> 13:42.487
I mean, what, do I put it
on the wire, put out an APB...

13:42.649 --> 13:44.162
...or ship it to the psychic hotline?

13:46.049 --> 13:48.005
Oh, wait. Wait, that's it, that's him.

13:48.169 --> 13:49.807
- Are you sure?
- Positive.

13:50.009 --> 13:52.318
All right, print us up a copy,
run it through the database,

13:52.489 --> 13:54.127
try to get us a name.

13:54.289 --> 13:55.961
Just do it.

14:02.049 --> 14:03.926
- Gilbert Van Lewen.
- You know him?

14:04.089 --> 14:07.240
Well, I know the name.
His family has a huge art collection,

14:07.409 --> 14:08.842
part of which they wanted to sell

14:09.009 --> 14:11.842
when his father mysteriously died
last summer.

14:12.009 --> 14:16.560
Wait. I just read somewhere that his
brother died a couple of days ago too.

14:16.729 --> 14:20.881
So it sounds like the ghost
isn't just after baby Matthew.

14:21.049 --> 14:23.609
Hey, you wanna meet me and Morris
down at the Van Lewen estate,

14:23.769 --> 14:25.202
have a little chat with Gilbert?

14:25.369 --> 14:28.839
It would help to have an active power
there just in case the ghost shows up.

14:29.009 --> 14:31.762
Sure. Who wants to go
to New York anyway?

14:33.489 --> 14:35.081
Bye.

14:35.369 --> 14:38.327
That's for you.
And thank you very much.

14:38.729 --> 14:40.526
Lunch is served.

14:46.489 --> 14:48.798
Alexandra, for God's sakes,
keep your voice down, please.

14:48.969 --> 14:50.846
Where's Matthew?
What did you do with him?

14:51.009 --> 14:54.046
You have got to believe me,
I did this for his own good.

14:54.209 --> 14:57.167
You can't just abandon our baby.
You can't just do that.

14:57.329 --> 15:00.366
I had to. He would have gotten to him
tomorrow at the christening, I know it.

15:00.529 --> 15:03.441
That's when he strikes,
at the moment of greatest joy.

15:03.609 --> 15:07.568
Okay, Gilbert, listen to me. I know that
you've been under a lot of strain

15:07.729 --> 15:09.321
because of what happened
to your brother.

15:09.489 --> 15:11.525
But this whole ghost thing
has got to stop.

15:11.689 --> 15:15.967
Don't you understand? It's crazy.
There's no such thing as a...

15:16.969 --> 15:17.958
It's him.

15:18.129 --> 15:19.926
Gilbert, you've gotta
get out of here now.

15:20.089 --> 15:22.000
Too late, Martha.

15:23.289 --> 15:25.883
- He's next.
- No, not again.

15:26.049 --> 15:30.565
I have suffered enough.
Please spare my last son.

15:30.729 --> 15:34.688
If he brings the baby back, perhaps.

15:35.529 --> 15:36.757
Never.

15:46.249 --> 15:49.719
You're stuck here, Martha.
I won't let you leave...

15:50.569 --> 15:55.802
...until you have watched me kill
every last male in your family.

16:07.729 --> 16:09.082
Hey, what's going on?

16:09.249 --> 16:11.558
Apparently Gilbert Van Lewen
fell over the banister.

16:11.729 --> 16:14.402
The medical examiner is gonna
list the cause of death as accidental.

16:14.569 --> 16:16.878
Sure have been a lot of accidents
around here lately.

16:17.049 --> 16:19.517
- Yeah, well, welcome to Homicide.
- Poor Matthew.

16:19.689 --> 16:21.725
We don't know for sure
that Gilbert was his father.

16:21.889 --> 16:24.039
- Well, we have to find out for sure.
- Well, hold it.

16:24.209 --> 16:25.767
Number one, this isn't my crime scene.

16:25.929 --> 16:27.920
Number two, you ain't cops,
remember?

16:28.089 --> 16:29.761
Darryl, we cannot just walk
away from this.

16:29.929 --> 16:32.568
We have to find out whether
this is Matthew's home or not.

16:38.249 --> 16:41.161
- They're with me.
- Let me guess, your psychic friends?

16:41.329 --> 16:43.445
Let me guess.
You wanna be a meter maid.

16:44.729 --> 16:46.321
- Who called it in?
- The victim's mother,

16:46.489 --> 16:48.559
Martha Van Lewen.
She's around the corner.

16:49.529 --> 16:52.805
I'll do all the talking
to Mrs Van Lewen. Are we clear?

16:52.969 --> 16:54.641
Perfectly.

16:55.489 --> 16:57.207
Easy. Coming through.

16:59.969 --> 17:02.005
Mrs Van Lewen,
I'm Inspector Morris.

17:02.209 --> 17:05.121
- I'm terribly sorry for your loss.
- Thank you.

17:05.289 --> 17:07.848
I have a couple of questions for you
and your daughter-in-law.

17:08.409 --> 17:12.084
Well, Alexandra's off resting, she's...

17:12.249 --> 17:14.809
...in a great deal of pain,
as you can imagine.

17:14.969 --> 17:18.405
- Of course. She's with her baby then?
- No.

17:18.569 --> 17:21.878
My grandson's staying
at his aunt's in Sonoma.

17:22.049 --> 17:26.008
I'm sorry, inspector, I really
don't feel like talking anymore.

17:26.209 --> 17:28.882
I understand. Again, my condolences.

17:46.689 --> 17:48.964
Yeah, no question about it.

17:49.729 --> 17:51.845
They must love him dearly.

17:52.009 --> 17:54.921
Can't imagine how painful
it must have been to let him go.

17:56.489 --> 17:58.400
We probably shouldn't mention
where the baby is,

17:58.569 --> 18:00.799
in case Casper's still around.

18:00.969 --> 18:02.561
What are you doing in here?

18:02.769 --> 18:04.646
Oh, hi.

18:04.809 --> 18:07.198
Sorry. Alexandra?

18:08.169 --> 18:09.158
Who are you?

18:09.569 --> 18:12.845
I'm Phoebe, and this is my sister Prue.
And we are...

18:13.009 --> 18:15.887
Grief counsellors
with the police department.

18:17.249 --> 18:20.559
I don't need any counselling.
I just need to be alone.

18:21.169 --> 18:24.241
- We understand.
- More than you know.

18:27.009 --> 18:30.479
- We can help you, Alexandra.
- Oh, yeah?

18:30.649 --> 18:33.766
- Can you bring back my husband?
- No.

18:34.489 --> 18:36.798
But maybe somebody else.

18:39.689 --> 18:43.204
Please leave. Just go.

18:48.529 --> 18:51.521
Okay, isn't it anybody else's turn yet?
I'm dying here.

18:51.689 --> 18:54.408
Just a bit longer, Piper. I had no idea
there was so much information

18:54.569 --> 18:56.161
about the Van Lewens on the Internet.

18:56.329 --> 18:58.968
Yeah, and Jack pushed
the presentation, which means

18:59.129 --> 19:00.801
I've got until morning to salvage it.

19:01.009 --> 19:04.046
I don't understand why you didn't come
out and tell them we had Matthew.

19:04.209 --> 19:06.882
Because we couldn't risk the ghost
following us home and finding him.

19:07.049 --> 19:09.244
We have to figure out
how to vanquish the ghost.

19:09.409 --> 19:12.446
Yeah, in less than 12 hours, before
Darryl comes and takes him away.

19:12.609 --> 19:15.442
Well, the thing about ghosts is they
always haunt for a specific reason.

19:15.609 --> 19:16.928
And it's always personal.

19:17.089 --> 19:18.886
So I know the Van Lewens
know this ghost.

19:19.569 --> 19:21.321
- And I am going to find him.
- No.

19:21.489 --> 19:24.401
I'm gonna find him.
Okay, time's up. He's all yours.

19:24.569 --> 19:31.247
Come here. Okay. I know.
It's okay, baby. It's okay.

19:31.409 --> 19:33.400
Why isn't he stopping?
He's not stopping.

19:33.569 --> 19:36.288
- Maybe it's a hungry cry.
- But you just fed him.

19:36.689 --> 19:38.122
Maybe it's a sleepy cry.

19:38.289 --> 19:40.598
If it was a sleepy cry,
wouldn't he just fall asleep?

19:41.329 --> 19:44.082
Maybe it's a burpy cry.
Do you have gas?

19:47.489 --> 19:50.208
Something tells me it's going to be
a very long night.

19:58.249 --> 20:00.126
I thought that babies slept a lot.

20:00.289 --> 20:03.964
Yeah, obviously one of those lies they
tell you so you'll wanna get pregnant.

20:04.129 --> 20:06.768
- So much for being the natural.
- Hey, everyone has their limits.

20:06.929 --> 20:09.887
- Anything in Dr. Spock?
- Nothing that we haven't already tried.

20:10.049 --> 20:12.438
- How's the search going?
- Not so good.

20:12.609 --> 20:15.328
The Van Lewens are seriously loaded.

20:15.489 --> 20:18.526
There could be hundreds of dead
people holding a grudge against them.

20:18.689 --> 20:22.398
Well, why don't you just focus on
the time of Martha's husband's death.

20:22.569 --> 20:24.844
- I mean, that was the first...
- What did you do?

20:25.009 --> 20:26.647
- I didn't do anything.
- Well, do something.

20:26.849 --> 20:29.568
Okay, okay, okay.

20:30.289 --> 20:33.520
Here we go. I'm sorry. I know.

20:35.049 --> 20:37.438
It's okay. It's okay.

20:39.249 --> 20:40.967
Okay.

20:47.689 --> 20:49.919
Doesn't that fall under
the personal-gain category?

20:50.129 --> 20:53.121
Oh, who cares?
We're desperate, and it's working.

20:54.049 --> 20:56.768
He likes it, that is so sweet.

20:59.249 --> 21:01.717
Oh, no, not again.

21:11.969 --> 21:14.403
Here, this might be something.
The Van Lewen family chauffer,

21:14.569 --> 21:18.881
Elias Lundy, disappeared suddenly
just before Martha's husband died.

21:19.049 --> 21:23.486
Well, disappeared doesn't mean dead.
Maybe it just means he took off.

21:23.649 --> 21:26.004
Well, if he did, he took off
without anything he owned,

21:26.169 --> 21:28.683
including his savings account
and his car.

21:28.849 --> 21:32.239
That's definitely something that we
should ask Martha Van Lewen about.

21:32.409 --> 21:33.603
Yeah, if she'll talk to us.

21:33.769 --> 21:36.363
Well, if she ever wants to get
her grandson back safe, she will.

21:36.529 --> 21:39.885
Okay, forget Dr. Spock.
This is the only book we need.

21:40.049 --> 21:41.767
The Book of Shadows?
I don't think so.

21:41.929 --> 21:45.126
Well, Mom wrote spells in it, right?
And with three girls, there has to be

21:45.289 --> 21:48.918
something in here about,
you know, how to do...

21:49.569 --> 21:51.002
Oh, here it is.

21:53.449 --> 21:57.488
- "Sometimes a baby just has to cry."
- Thanks, Mom.

21:57.649 --> 22:00.925
I don't understand why this is so hard.
We're women, it should be in our DNA.

22:06.569 --> 22:08.799
I can't keep doing this all night.

22:37.529 --> 22:38.928
- What?
- Just wondering

22:39.089 --> 22:40.647
if you're too good to be true.

22:40.889 --> 22:44.245
Maybe someday you'll find out
through personal experience.

22:46.849 --> 22:50.239
- I have to go to work.
- Hi, silly.

22:54.849 --> 22:56.840
- Thanks, really.
- It was my pleasure.

22:57.769 --> 22:59.919
He really is beautiful.

23:00.329 --> 23:02.445
Just like his cousin.

23:04.689 --> 23:05.883
Bye.

23:07.009 --> 23:08.647
Silly.

23:16.169 --> 23:18.922
Oh, what time is it?
Quarter till 8. I'm late.

23:19.089 --> 23:21.728
I've gotta go to Martha Van Lewen.
Piper, will you come with me?

23:21.889 --> 23:23.845
Yeah. Right behind you.

23:29.329 --> 23:33.368
- Oh, I think we forgot something.
- What are we gonna do with him?

23:37.729 --> 23:40.448
Hey. You ready to wow Caldwell?

23:41.089 --> 23:43.922
Well, actually...

23:47.649 --> 23:50.163
You get that through Office Supplies?

23:50.329 --> 23:52.638
Okay, I had to bring him.
There was nowhere else to put him.

23:52.809 --> 23:55.243
And I think we should talk to Caldwell
about a day-care centre.

23:55.409 --> 23:57.639
I mean, I'm not the only one
with a child around here.

23:57.969 --> 24:02.201
Prue, unless you have a really big
surprise for me, you don't have a kid.

24:02.369 --> 24:03.927
I know that.

24:04.329 --> 24:06.524
But I'm going to one day.

24:08.889 --> 24:11.005
Hey, it's okay.

24:14.009 --> 24:17.240
He only likes this finger, and it took me
all night to figure that out.

24:17.409 --> 24:20.003
But you should see me at diapering.
I'm really good at it.

24:20.169 --> 24:23.047
Yeah, okay, you know, this mothering
instinct is really something.

24:23.209 --> 24:24.961
But me, I've got my own inner child,

24:25.129 --> 24:27.006
and right now he's thinking
about New York.

24:27.169 --> 24:28.443
Right.

24:29.529 --> 24:32.043
Jack, I didn't really finish
the presentation.

24:32.809 --> 24:35.369
You know, I figured you were
probably still in a family crisis,

24:35.529 --> 24:37.997
especially after
the tenth unanswered call,

24:38.169 --> 24:40.729
so I hope you don't mind,
but I took the liberty

24:40.889 --> 24:43.767
of finishing the presentation myself.

24:43.929 --> 24:45.282
Anything to get you to New York.

24:47.969 --> 24:50.881
- You're the best.
- He certainly is.

24:51.049 --> 24:54.086
And since I need my best
and brightest in New York,

24:54.249 --> 24:56.888
I'm taking you
out of the running, Halliwell.

24:57.049 --> 25:00.758
Mr Caldwell, you know, I finished
the presentation based on her file.

25:00.929 --> 25:02.328
I mean, she had a family emergency.

25:02.489 --> 25:04.002
She has a lot of those, doesn't she.

25:04.929 --> 25:08.239
We'll show your presentation
to the client at noon, Sheridan.

25:31.129 --> 25:33.006
- Yes?
- We need to talk to you.

25:33.489 --> 25:36.959
- Are you with the police?
- No, not really.

25:37.129 --> 25:39.643
- But we are here to help.
- I don't understand.

25:39.809 --> 25:43.245
Does the name Elias Lundy
mean anything to you?

25:43.889 --> 25:47.404
Martha, the funeral home called,
and they wanted to know if...

25:47.929 --> 25:49.806
What are you doing here?

25:52.009 --> 25:53.965
I'm here because we really
need to talk to you.

25:54.129 --> 25:57.326
- And I think you know what about.
- Who are you people?

25:57.649 --> 25:59.526
What do you want?

26:07.089 --> 26:08.317
Please tell me he's okay.

26:08.889 --> 26:11.483
Please come with us, someplace safe,
where we can talk about this.

26:13.089 --> 26:14.442
Oh, no.

26:20.609 --> 26:23.885
- Where is the child?
- No, please don't tell him.

26:26.769 --> 26:28.566
He didn't freeze.
Why didn't he freeze?

26:28.729 --> 26:31.323
What are you? Witches?

26:31.489 --> 26:34.481
- I've frozen ghosts before, haven't I?
- Okay, Piper, now is not the time.

26:34.649 --> 26:36.605
Just unfreeze them
so we can get them out of here.

26:37.329 --> 26:38.682
Down.

26:41.249 --> 26:42.841
Let's go.

26:53.649 --> 26:57.198
Bring me the child, or she's dead.

27:01.769 --> 27:04.567
Looks like I'm not
the only one stuck here.

27:13.249 --> 27:16.639
You know, you'd be more comfortable
at our place with your baby.

27:17.649 --> 27:19.719
It's too much of a risk.

27:20.969 --> 27:25.247
As much as I am dying to see him
and to hold him...

27:26.409 --> 27:29.082
...I just can't.
- I don't think the ghost can follow you.

27:29.249 --> 27:31.809
Or us. I mean, he couldn't chase us
out of the house.

27:31.969 --> 27:33.687
I don't think he could leave the house.

27:33.849 --> 27:37.125
But you're not positive. I mean,
you don't know that for sure, do you?

27:38.249 --> 27:42.128
I've seen what he can do.
I watched him kill my husband.

27:42.929 --> 27:45.602
- I won't watch him hurt my son.
- It's okay.

27:45.769 --> 27:48.044
Everything's gonna be okay.

27:48.489 --> 27:51.765
Now, what did you husband tell you
about Elias Lundy?

27:52.489 --> 27:55.879
He was their chauffeur.

27:56.249 --> 27:58.717
But he was obsessed with Martha.

27:58.889 --> 28:02.564
Even carved his and Martha's initials
on the largest oak on the ground.

28:02.729 --> 28:03.957
I've seen it.

28:04.289 --> 28:07.486
But one day, apparently
his obsession got out of hand,

28:07.649 --> 28:10.209
and Lundy attacked Martha.

28:10.769 --> 28:15.559
My father-in-law lured him out to that
same tree and shot him in the back.

28:15.729 --> 28:18.004
Buried him on the grounds.
Covered it up.

28:18.729 --> 28:21.527
Well, that would explain
why he suddenly disappeared.

28:21.689 --> 28:23.725
A week later, my father-in-law
mysteriously died.

28:23.889 --> 28:26.005
At the house too.

28:26.529 --> 28:31.523
And then Gilbert's brother
and his uncle, and then...

28:32.929 --> 28:35.568
They all just look like accidents,
you know, bad luck.

28:35.729 --> 28:38.038
Martha knew, but she just
couldn't convince anybody.

28:38.209 --> 28:40.040
I don't understand
why you stayed in that house.

28:40.209 --> 28:42.245
Why didn't Gilbert get you
out of there?

28:42.409 --> 28:47.722
Until Gilbert's brother died,
he didn't believe the story either.

28:48.089 --> 28:51.718
Martha tried to sell the house once,
but I guess Lundy wouldn't let her.

28:52.249 --> 28:55.446
He wants her to suffer
for what her husband did to him.

28:55.609 --> 28:57.804
And he's not gonna quit
until he gets Matthew too.

28:58.649 --> 29:00.480
Yeah, well,

29:00.809 --> 29:03.369
we won't quit until we get him.

29:03.809 --> 29:07.484
Now, do you have any idea where on
the grounds Lundy's body is buried?

29:08.409 --> 29:11.958
Supposedly by that tree.
Under the initials.

29:15.689 --> 29:17.281
Whoa, Prue.

29:17.449 --> 29:20.327
Hey, don't touch that dial. I just
came back from Caldwell's office.

29:20.489 --> 29:23.526
I told him I couldn't have finished the
presentation without the work you did,

29:23.689 --> 29:27.238
and I couldn't do the job to his level
of quality without my beautiful partner.

29:28.569 --> 29:31.800
Plane leaves in two hours.
Sorry, squirt, I only got two.

29:32.209 --> 29:34.962
- Kids under 2 fly free.
- Afraid you were gonna say that.

29:36.129 --> 29:39.041
You know what? Whatever.
I'm game.

29:39.209 --> 29:41.404
Jack, that's sweet.

29:41.569 --> 29:44.686
Thank you so much for sticking up
for me, but I can't. I gotta get home.

29:44.889 --> 29:48.120
- I'm sorry.
- Yeah, me too.

29:48.489 --> 29:51.481
- Hey, you two make a nice couple.
- Thanks.

29:57.369 --> 29:59.678
Prue's on her way back.

29:59.849 --> 30:01.601
That stuff could melt your nostrils.

30:01.769 --> 30:04.124
Yeah, like all the diaper changing
didn't melt them already.

30:04.769 --> 30:06.725
Okay, some mandrake root...

30:06.889 --> 30:10.040
You know, I could have sworn that
I'd be good at this whole baby thing.

30:10.209 --> 30:13.724
I mean, I love kids. I'm giving,
I'm a good person...

30:13.889 --> 30:16.323
Phoebe, I don't think Matthew
was rejecting you personally.

30:16.489 --> 30:19.526
- At least, no more than the rest of us.
- Then why do I feel like a failure?

30:19.689 --> 30:21.327
Every time I get close
to the little guy,

30:21.489 --> 30:23.127
he either opens his mouth
or his bowels.

30:23.289 --> 30:25.678
I mean, call me kooky,
but that feels like rejection to me.

30:25.849 --> 30:29.319
It takes a lot of time to figure out
how to take care of babies properly.

30:29.489 --> 30:33.641
- It's a lot of work.
- A lot more than I thought, actually.

30:33.849 --> 30:35.919
We should be grateful
we have a little time off.

30:36.089 --> 30:37.283
Absolutely.

30:38.569 --> 30:40.400
I miss him.

30:40.809 --> 30:43.562
It is a little quiet around here.
Okay, let's just focus.

30:43.969 --> 30:45.402
Okay, do you wanna get
the shovels?

30:46.009 --> 30:48.364
Shovels? I thought we were
vanquishing Lundy with a potion.

30:48.529 --> 30:50.918
- What do we need shovels for?
- Because the only way it works

30:51.089 --> 30:54.525
is if you spread it over his bones,
which happen to be buried.

30:54.729 --> 30:57.118
- We have to dig him up?
- I'm afraid so.

30:58.009 --> 31:00.000
Is that it? Or is there
some other disgusting detail

31:00.169 --> 31:02.285
- you're just waiting to spring on me?
- No.

31:02.449 --> 31:05.725
The only other way to vanquish him
is to destroy the object of the curse,

31:05.889 --> 31:08.357
which is Martha.
And we're supposed to save Martha.

31:08.529 --> 31:10.520
So get the shovels.

31:11.369 --> 31:14.566
Hi, Matthew, how's the little man?
What are you doing?

31:14.729 --> 31:16.447
The baby's home. Hi, baby.

31:16.609 --> 31:18.804
Hey, I'm home too.

31:18.969 --> 31:21.324
- Okay, guys, are we ready?
- Yes, we're ready.

31:21.489 --> 31:23.605
I really think someone should
stay here with Matthew.

31:23.769 --> 31:26.203
I'll stay.

31:26.369 --> 31:29.122
Looks like we finally
all fell for the same guy.

31:30.249 --> 31:33.047
Hi, baby. What you doing?

31:36.889 --> 31:38.880
Time's up, ladies.
Social Services called,

31:39.049 --> 31:41.802
- they wanna know where the baby is.
- Tell them he's with us.

31:41.969 --> 31:44.244
Three witches and a baby.
I don't think that's gonna fly.

31:44.409 --> 31:46.843
But you can't take him now.
We're this close to vanquishing...

31:47.009 --> 31:49.125
I don't wanna hear
another ghost story.

31:49.289 --> 31:51.007
In the real world,
that baby was abandoned.

31:51.169 --> 31:54.400
Which means if I don't account
for him, I could lose my shield.

31:54.569 --> 31:58.608
Not if you can offer
a plausible explanation, right?

31:58.969 --> 32:02.120
I mean, what if he was kidnapped
and then abandoned?

32:02.809 --> 32:04.242
You would be a hero.

32:04.409 --> 32:06.559
You would be the one
reuniting him with his mom.

32:09.889 --> 32:11.527
Look, just...

32:11.969 --> 32:13.402
...hold off for a few hours, okay?

32:13.569 --> 32:16.481
If we're not back,
then do what you have to do.

32:16.649 --> 32:20.324
And here, take this, he really likes it.

32:20.489 --> 32:23.128
And don't wave things in his face,
because he does not like that.

32:23.289 --> 32:24.881
He likes the jiggle.
Do you know the jiggle?

32:25.089 --> 32:26.727
Of course I know the jiggle.
I'm a father.

32:26.889 --> 32:28.117
Okay, and if he starts to cry,

32:28.289 --> 32:30.519
just hold him really close,
because it comforts him.

32:31.049 --> 32:32.846
Okay. Bye.

32:34.209 --> 32:36.598
Prue, you're not gonna wear that,
are you?

32:36.769 --> 32:39.727
Didn't think so.
We'll meet you in the car, all right?

32:46.249 --> 32:52.006
You can't keep hiding from me,
Martha. I'll always find you.

32:56.409 --> 32:58.764
You can punish me all you like,
Elias, it doesn't matter.

32:58.929 --> 33:02.001
I don't know where Matthew is,
and even if I did, I wouldn't tell you.

33:09.849 --> 33:12.647
- Did she say where the oak tree was?
- I assume around back.

33:12.809 --> 33:15.960
Okay, you two go dig him up, and I'll
protect Martha for as long as I can.

33:16.129 --> 33:17.767
All right.

33:29.129 --> 33:32.121
Prue. Over here.

33:41.689 --> 33:43.520
This has gotta be it.

33:44.049 --> 33:46.085
Okay, hold this.

33:46.569 --> 33:49.800
Pheebs, I think I have
a much quicker way of doing that.

33:50.609 --> 33:53.442
Oh, yeah, you do, don't you? Okay.

33:54.169 --> 33:55.648
- All right.
- All right.

33:55.809 --> 33:57.640
Are you ready?

34:08.208 --> 34:10.085
Hello, Elias.

34:15.849 --> 34:19.888
There are many things
worse than death, Martha.

34:20.649 --> 34:22.161
You taught me that.

34:24.449 --> 34:27.839
I can keep doing this forever.

34:29.969 --> 34:31.687
I don't think so.

34:33.049 --> 34:36.724
Bring me the child, and I'll spare you.

34:36.889 --> 34:38.958
Actually, I think it's a little late for that.

34:47.329 --> 34:50.241
My bones. My grave.

34:54.849 --> 34:57.443
All right, here it goes.

35:06.769 --> 35:10.728
You can't vanquish me
without my bones, can you?

35:11.489 --> 35:13.207
- Busted.
- Run.

35:29.369 --> 35:32.327
- Piper, where are you?
- Upstairs.

35:35.769 --> 35:37.839
- Have you seen Lundy?
- What do you mean?

35:38.009 --> 35:39.920
Didn't you vanquish him?

35:40.569 --> 35:43.288
No. And it doesn't look like
we'll ever be able to.

35:44.609 --> 35:47.407
He's hidden his bones someplace
that we'll never be able to find them.

35:47.609 --> 35:49.167
Then you have to get
out of here now.

35:49.329 --> 35:50.842
No, we're not leaving you.

35:51.009 --> 35:54.240
You haven't got a choice
if there's no other way to stop him.

35:57.409 --> 35:59.320
- It's not an option.
- Agreed.

35:59.649 --> 36:01.162
What?

36:02.249 --> 36:04.205
What is it?
I think I have a right to know.

36:05.489 --> 36:09.687
It's just that there is one other way
to vanquish a ghost.

36:09.849 --> 36:13.364
And that's to destroy
the object of its wrath.

36:13.689 --> 36:15.645
Meaning me?

36:18.209 --> 36:21.121
Are you saying that if I die,
he dies too?

36:21.289 --> 36:25.043
No, our job is to protect the innocent,
and that would be you.

36:25.609 --> 36:27.565
No, it isn't.

36:28.849 --> 36:33.639
It wasn't my husband who shot Elias
in the back, it was me. I did it.

36:35.809 --> 36:39.165
He wanted me for himself. He said
he was gonna kill my husband.

36:39.329 --> 36:42.241
Yet I did, didn't I?

36:43.449 --> 36:47.044
How could you, Martha? I loved you.

36:47.929 --> 36:50.079
Well, I didn't love you.

36:51.569 --> 36:56.279
- They can't protect you forever.
- You're absolutely right.

36:57.009 --> 36:59.523
But I can protect Matthew.

37:01.169 --> 37:02.682
Martha, no!

37:03.929 --> 37:05.328
No!

37:19.209 --> 37:21.040
Martha.

37:21.569 --> 37:24.447
- What have you done?
- Killed us both.

37:26.129 --> 37:28.245
Go to hell, Elias.

37:48.289 --> 37:50.439
- What do we do?
- Don't do anything.

37:50.729 --> 37:52.162
This is where I belong.

37:52.689 --> 37:55.487
This is the only way
to save my grandchild.

37:55.649 --> 37:57.958
Thank you for protecting him.

38:43.529 --> 38:44.962
Here they are.

38:52.249 --> 38:53.967
Here, we wanted you to have this.

38:54.129 --> 38:56.563
But we couldn't get all the throw-up
off of it.

38:57.129 --> 39:01.441
That's okay. You're all so sweet.
How can I thank you?

39:01.609 --> 39:03.679
Oh, just let us babysit
every once in a while.

39:04.569 --> 39:06.400
Just take good care of him.

39:07.209 --> 39:09.086
Bye, honey.

39:09.249 --> 39:10.682
I know.

39:10.929 --> 39:13.682
Bye, baby. Hey. Where did he go?

39:14.169 --> 39:16.478
- Bye.
- Thank you.

39:17.209 --> 39:18.801
You're welcome.

39:31.449 --> 39:33.724
Okay, so how many kids do you think
I'm gonna have someday?

39:33.889 --> 39:36.449
- I'd say five.
- More. At least six.

39:37.529 --> 39:38.962
What makes you say that?

39:39.129 --> 39:40.960
Oh, please, Pheebs,
you were born to be a mom.

39:41.169 --> 39:45.321
- No doubt about it.
- Yeah? You think? Oh, I hope so.

39:45.489 --> 39:47.241
I miss that little guy already.

39:47.409 --> 39:50.128
Although being a surrogate mom
for the last 24 hours has taught me

39:50.289 --> 39:52.883
I have a long way to go
before I'm ready for it full time.

39:53.049 --> 39:57.042
- I gotta get my life together first.
- Yeah, and find a guy, maybe.

39:57.209 --> 39:59.279
That would probably help, huh?

40:00.009 --> 40:03.160
Unlike Piper's guy,
who is, like, Mr. Mom.

40:03.609 --> 40:05.440
Dan was really great
with Matthew, wasn't he?

40:05.609 --> 40:08.407
- More like a godsend.
- I think that's what scares me.

40:08.569 --> 40:11.003
He's, like, flawless.
He's great at everything.

40:11.169 --> 40:13.967
He's great-looking, he's fun,
he's great with babies...

40:14.129 --> 40:16.802
- But?
- But...

40:16.969 --> 40:18.800
...I don't know.
He's just a little too perfect.

40:18.969 --> 40:20.607
I feel a little imperfect around him.

40:20.769 --> 40:23.329
Well, maybe that's why you
were uncomfortable with Matthew.

40:23.489 --> 40:26.606
Maybe because of Dan, you were
resisting your own maternal instincts.

40:26.769 --> 40:29.329
- Where did that come from?
- Cosmo, where else?

40:32.089 --> 40:34.205
Look over there. There's Jack.

40:35.129 --> 40:36.323
- Jack?
- Yeah, Jack.

40:36.489 --> 40:38.127
Jack who?

40:40.809 --> 40:43.926
Hey. Why aren't you in New York?

40:44.089 --> 40:46.159
I didn't wanna go without my partner.

40:46.329 --> 40:48.081
I don't want you to think
this gesture of mine

40:48.249 --> 40:50.080
is in any way a sign
of evolving maturity,

40:50.249 --> 40:52.763
in case having your cousin Matthew
around gave you any ideas.

40:53.409 --> 40:56.719
You know, the only idea
that I have is that one day,

40:56.889 --> 40:59.926
maybe sooner, maybe later,
I'm gonna make a great mom.

41:01.329 --> 41:03.797
And you know, hopefully,
I'll find the right guy.

41:04.809 --> 41:07.801
Well, then I think you should know
that being as I'm still a kid myself,

41:07.969 --> 41:09.880
I don't think I'd be doing anyone
any favours

41:10.049 --> 41:12.358
by pretending to be the right guy.

41:12.849 --> 41:16.159
Well, I didn't say I was looking
for the right guy tonight.

41:16.329 --> 41:19.765
- You'll do. Let's go. Dance?
- Sure.
