00:09.009 --> 00:11.302
[siren wailing in distance]

00:11.386 --> 00:12.345
[flashbulb snaps]

00:12.429 --> 00:13.805
[officer] Turn to your left.

00:17.475 --> 00:18.601
-Listen--
-To your right.

00:18.685 --> 00:19.686
Stop talking.

00:20.687 --> 00:21.646
Face forward.

00:37.996 --> 00:39.873
Castello. You made bail.

00:46.629 --> 00:49.090
[Jack] What the fuck, Ernie?
I was in there all night.

00:49.174 --> 00:51.051
[Ernie] Well, I had to make
a couple of phone calls

00:51.134 --> 00:53.678
and hand-deliver $200
to the police superintendent.

00:53.970 --> 00:56.973
I'm an actor, Ernie. I'm a serious actor.
I can't have a record.

00:57.057 --> 00:59.434
[Ernie] Yeah, you can.
Ever heard of Frank Sinatra?

01:01.561 --> 01:03.438
Look, I've been arrested a bunch of times.

01:04.022 --> 01:06.524
Vice squads, they're just part of the gig.

01:06.608 --> 01:08.985
The hypocrisy of it all
is what this town is built on.

01:09.069 --> 01:12.155
The movies hawk an image
of wholesome American virtue, right?

01:12.238 --> 01:15.200
The folks making those movies...
rotten to the core.

01:16.159 --> 01:17.660
What am I gonna tell my wife?

01:18.119 --> 01:18.995
[engine starts]

01:19.996 --> 01:21.623
[big band music playing]

02:07.961 --> 02:08.962
[bell dings]

02:15.844 --> 02:18.847
[big band music playing on radio]

02:20.390 --> 02:23.309
[Ernie] Hey, Jack.
Avis needs her tank filled again.

02:23.434 --> 02:25.019
-Right now?
-This afternoon.

02:25.103 --> 02:27.188
Avis has never been a quick lay.
I like that about her.

02:27.272 --> 02:28.565
She's old-fashioned and romantic.

02:28.648 --> 02:31.067
Sometimes she likes to be wined and dined,
even if she's paying.

02:31.151 --> 02:33.444
Today's Bugsy Siegel's estate sale
in Beverly Hills.

02:33.528 --> 02:36.239
Might even be the house he got shot in.
That'd be kind of neat.

02:36.322 --> 02:37.282
You'll need a suit.

02:37.365 --> 02:38.908
Uh, Ernie, I can't stay out all night.

02:38.992 --> 02:42.704
Look, my wife is gonna kill me,
and I got that screen test, I got...

02:42.787 --> 02:44.414
Ernie! Fuck.

02:48.418 --> 02:49.252
[Avis] Vera.

02:50.086 --> 02:50.962
Stanley.

02:51.546 --> 02:52.380
Hello.

02:53.006 --> 02:55.341
Thank you so much.
Do I hear seventeen-five?

02:55.425 --> 02:56.342
Seventeen-five?

02:56.426 --> 02:59.762
-Seventeen-five right here for this...
-Tell me I look pretty today, Jack.

03:00.096 --> 03:01.014
[Jack] You do.

03:01.556 --> 03:02.932
You always look beautiful.

03:03.183 --> 03:04.559
You always smell rich.

03:04.642 --> 03:05.935
[Avis chuckles]

03:06.019 --> 03:08.021
Maybe later you'll take me dancing.

03:08.104 --> 03:09.230
[Jack] Uh, yeah, maybe.

03:09.314 --> 03:13.026
Sold right here for $17,500.
Thank you, sir.

03:13.109 --> 03:15.945
Up next? Lot number 102,

03:16.029 --> 03:19.657
a soup tureen in sterling silver
from Mr. Siegel's collection.

03:19.741 --> 03:24.120
Now we will start the bidding for this
item at $500. Who will give me 500?

03:24.412 --> 03:25.246
Two thousand!

03:25.330 --> 03:26.915
Two thousand dollars to the lady.

03:26.998 --> 03:29.500
Thank you so much, at $2,000.
Do I hear $2,100?

03:29.584 --> 03:30.752
That's my soup tureen.

03:30.835 --> 03:32.837
Bugsy borrowed it and never gave it back.

03:33.379 --> 03:34.672
[Jack] Listen, about the dancing,

03:34.756 --> 03:38.259
I got a screen test in the morning,
so I really can't stay out all night.

03:38.927 --> 03:41.804
This casting assistant's really
going out on a limb for me.

03:41.888 --> 03:43.514
I've never had a screen test before.

03:43.598 --> 03:44.474
Where is it?

03:44.557 --> 03:45.892
Uh, Ace Studios.

03:45.975 --> 03:47.227
[auctioneer continues]

03:47.352 --> 03:49.270
My husband is Ace Studios.

03:49.896 --> 03:52.732
-[chuckles]
-[laughing]

03:52.815 --> 03:55.860
He's in Paris,
wooing Gene Tierney back to Hollywood.

03:55.944 --> 03:56.861
Home in the morning.

03:57.528 --> 03:58.363
So...

03:59.197 --> 04:00.949
tonight you take care of mama.

04:01.407 --> 04:03.284
Tomorrow she takes care of you.

04:04.452 --> 04:05.328
Twenty-four.

04:05.411 --> 04:07.580
Three thousand to the lady in the back!

04:07.664 --> 04:09.123
Three thousand's going once.

04:09.207 --> 04:10.708
Three thousand is going twice!

04:10.792 --> 04:14.087
Sold for $3,000
to the lucky lady in lavender.

04:14.170 --> 04:15.296
Congratulations.

04:16.464 --> 04:18.466
[Avis moaning]

04:21.928 --> 04:22.762
Yes!

04:24.055 --> 04:24.889
Yes!

04:25.181 --> 04:26.808
[moaning]

04:45.618 --> 04:46.786
[knocking on door]

04:46.911 --> 04:47.870
[woman] <i>Who is it?</i>

04:48.371 --> 04:49.414
It's Raymond Ainsley.

04:54.627 --> 04:56.462
I thought you were coming on Tuesday.

04:56.838 --> 04:58.298
It is Tuesday, Miss Wong.

04:59.424 --> 05:01.050
Should I come back some other time?

05:04.429 --> 05:06.014
Please forgive my appearance.

05:06.973 --> 05:08.391
Can I get you a Scotch?

05:09.100 --> 05:10.268
[Raymond] Um...

05:11.519 --> 05:12.353
No, thanks.

05:14.355 --> 05:16.149
So, Mr. Ainsley,

05:16.441 --> 05:18.526
what brings you to see the great ghost?

05:20.153 --> 05:23.740
Well, I sent you a script
that I wrote a few weeks back.

05:23.823 --> 05:25.325
-I'm not sure if you had the--
-Yes.

05:27.118 --> 05:29.620
<i>Angel of Shanghai,</i> I quite liked it.

05:29.704 --> 05:31.706
That's... that's wonderful!

05:32.248 --> 05:36.377
I have to say, Miss Wong, that I've
admired you for many, many years.

05:37.086 --> 05:39.297
I think what happened with
<i>The Good Earth</i> was just awful.

05:39.380 --> 05:41.466
-Were you in the war?
-Yes, I was. Navy.

05:41.924 --> 05:44.594
But I've been studying filmmaking
ever since I got home.

05:44.677 --> 05:46.637
You see,
I didn't like the way Asian people

05:46.721 --> 05:48.723
were treated during the war
in this country.

05:48.806 --> 05:52.810
Vilified to boost morale, and...
being half-Asian myself,

05:53.394 --> 05:54.354
I resented that,

05:54.687 --> 05:57.899
but I want to be making motion pictures
that put us in a different light.

05:57.982 --> 05:59.025
You're Asian?

06:00.068 --> 06:01.444
Half-Filipino, yes.

06:03.613 --> 06:04.655
Wow.

06:06.532 --> 06:09.369
Asian lead. Half-Asian director.

06:10.078 --> 06:12.205
Who do you think
would go see this picture?

06:12.413 --> 06:14.374
A good story is a good story, Miss Wong.

06:14.457 --> 06:16.584
My word! You're naive.

06:17.919 --> 06:20.380
They don't want a leading lady
who looks like me.

06:20.463 --> 06:23.091
That's the only thing
the audience cares about.

06:23.925 --> 06:24.926
You need proof?

06:26.344 --> 06:29.263
My entire career...

06:30.390 --> 06:33.684
oversexed, opium-addled courtesans,

06:33.768 --> 06:37.522
dangerously exotic,
Far Eastern temptresses.

06:38.314 --> 06:42.443
That's what they wanted to see
from someone who looks like me.

06:44.612 --> 06:48.366
You have a good script,
and you're probably quite talented...

06:50.868 --> 06:55.123
but you'd do well if you asked yourself
the million-dollar question.

06:57.417 --> 07:00.336
Who is ever going to make this movie?

07:00.420 --> 07:01.379
Ace Pictures.

07:03.339 --> 07:07.051
I sent the script to Dick Samuels and
his assistant called me and wants to meet.

07:16.853 --> 07:18.229
Hey there, beautiful lady.

07:19.814 --> 07:20.773
What are you doing?

07:21.315 --> 07:23.192
Just saying hi before my big meeting.

07:23.860 --> 07:27.238
What are you so afraid of? You're one
of Ace Pictures' newest contract players.

07:27.321 --> 07:31.284
Please. They're paying me $25 a week
to take acting classes,

07:31.701 --> 07:34.745
and they are not going to like
seeing a white man kissing me.

07:35.246 --> 07:36.664
Well, you may feel like an outsider,

07:36.747 --> 07:38.791
but when these folks look at you,
they don't see one.

07:38.875 --> 07:40.918
[women laughing]

07:41.419 --> 07:42.837
Who's holding court over there?

07:43.421 --> 07:45.131
[sighs] My competition.

07:45.214 --> 07:47.216
[laughter echoing]

07:56.642 --> 07:57.894
Christ. I gotta go.

07:58.436 --> 07:59.270
Good luck.

08:07.778 --> 08:09.572
So why do you think you're here,
Mr. Ainsley?

08:09.655 --> 08:12.533
I presume you saw my film reel
and read my script.

08:12.617 --> 08:14.076
You wouldn't be here if I hadn't.

08:14.160 --> 08:17.163
Well, guess who I got to play the lead.

08:18.331 --> 08:19.916
Anna May Wong.

08:19.999 --> 08:23.628
She'd be a tough sell to Mr. Amberg.
We hear she's a bit of a drinker.

08:23.711 --> 08:27.798
Well, the industry did that to her,
but make no mistake, she is still a star.

08:28.257 --> 08:29.884
We could resurrect her career,

08:29.967 --> 08:32.428
get her the Oscar she should have gotten
for <i>The Good Earth.</i>

08:33.137 --> 08:34.555
Are you familiar with the story?

08:34.639 --> 08:35.640
Familiar?

08:36.933 --> 08:38.184
Kid, I was there.

08:39.435 --> 08:42.730
<i>Irving Thalberg produced that picture.</i>
<i>I was his number two.</i>

08:43.064 --> 08:43.940
[sighs]

08:44.023 --> 08:46.234
You don't have to make me look Asian.

08:46.859 --> 08:48.444
I already am Asian.

08:48.778 --> 08:50.071
Best screen test I'd ever seen.

08:50.988 --> 08:53.741
<i>Anna May was the only</i>
<i>Asian movie star in town,</i>

08:53.824 --> 08:57.078
<i>and here, finally,</i>
<i>was a role she could shine in.</i>

08:58.287 --> 08:59.622
<i>It was her big moment.</i>

08:59.705 --> 09:01.249
Ready when you are, Mr. Franklin.

09:01.332 --> 09:02.458
She took it.

09:03.251 --> 09:05.962
<i>Head and shoulders above</i>
<i>every other girl we tested.</i>

09:06.045 --> 09:08.130
<i>The Good Earth,</i> Anna May Wong,
screen test, take one.

09:10.550 --> 09:11.384
[director] Okay,

09:11.926 --> 09:15.429
you're holding the body
of your newborn child

09:15.513 --> 09:18.391
and you hear the men in the other room

09:19.517 --> 09:20.643
and you enter...

09:21.852 --> 09:22.812
and action.

09:24.814 --> 09:28.359
"Twelve pieces for all my land.
I paid a hundred times that much.

09:28.734 --> 09:31.988
Thieves. Thieves.
And well you know I must sell."

09:33.281 --> 09:34.156
No.

09:36.742 --> 09:37.785
Not the land.

09:41.330 --> 09:42.873
We will not sell the land.

09:45.251 --> 09:46.335
We'll keep it.

09:49.255 --> 09:50.715
We'll go south...

09:52.425 --> 09:53.843
and when we return,

09:55.553 --> 09:57.471
we'll still have the land.

09:59.348 --> 10:01.100
"I've brought these men here.

10:01.976 --> 10:03.102
You must sell."

10:07.315 --> 10:08.399
Is it your land?

10:10.651 --> 10:13.404
Did you buy it bit by bit?

10:16.699 --> 10:18.200
The land is our life,

10:19.994 --> 10:24.790
and it's better to go south or die walking
than to give it to you for nothing.

10:27.043 --> 10:28.085
And they exit.

10:29.337 --> 10:31.714
Your husband Wong walks over to you.

10:35.551 --> 10:37.803
"How could you walk anywhere
with a child?"

10:45.269 --> 10:46.312
[sobbing softly]

10:46.395 --> 10:47.772
The child is dead.

10:48.397 --> 10:49.273
[director] "Dead?

10:51.317 --> 10:52.777
But I heard him crying."

10:55.321 --> 10:57.239
The child is dead.

11:00.242 --> 11:03.371
I was the one who had to tell her
we were giving the role to Luise.

11:03.454 --> 11:06.207
[man] And the Academy Award goes to...

11:07.625 --> 11:10.294
Luise Rainer for <i>The Good Earth!</i>

11:13.881 --> 11:17.051
This is Luise Rainer's second Oscar
in as many years,

11:17.385 --> 11:19.762
the first actress to achieve such a feat.

11:20.262 --> 11:23.140
Wow. What a night for Miss Rainer.
She looks over the moon!

11:27.269 --> 11:29.105
Thank you so much.

11:29.188 --> 11:35.736
I'd like to dedicate this Oscar to the
late Irving Thalberg, whose dedication...

11:51.335 --> 11:53.379
[Raymond]
<i>That's the saddest story I've ever heard.</i>

11:53.462 --> 11:54.672
What's so sad about it?

11:56.215 --> 11:58.384
Picture was a hit. Thalberg was right.

11:58.968 --> 12:02.304
You can't open a picture
with a Chinese lead or a colored one.

12:02.388 --> 12:05.391
-A number of theaters won't run it.
-But you said she deserved the part.

12:05.474 --> 12:07.435
Yes, but the hard fact is
had she gotten it,

12:08.936 --> 12:09.979
picture's not a hit.

12:10.062 --> 12:11.021
How do you know that?

12:11.522 --> 12:12.356
Excuse me?

12:12.440 --> 12:15.192
Well, you never made the movie, so...

12:15.276 --> 12:16.819
how do you know it's not a hit?

12:17.820 --> 12:19.739
I gotta say, Mr. Samuels,

12:19.822 --> 12:23.534
sometimes I think folks in this town don't
really understand the power they have.

12:23.617 --> 12:25.953
Movies don't just show us
how the world is,

12:26.036 --> 12:27.955
they show us how the world can be,

12:28.038 --> 12:30.332
and if we change the way
that movies are made,

12:30.416 --> 12:33.294
you take a chance
and you make a different kind of story,

12:33.377 --> 12:34.879
I think you can change the world.

12:38.507 --> 12:40.676
Here are some scripts that I'm, um...

12:40.760 --> 12:43.095
that Mr. Amberg is excited about.

12:43.179 --> 12:44.263
Read them.

12:45.556 --> 12:48.017
If you find something you like,
come back and let's talk.

12:48.309 --> 12:49.185
Okay.

12:49.351 --> 12:50.352
Uh...

12:50.895 --> 12:51.729
All of them?

12:53.689 --> 12:54.774
All of them.

12:54.857 --> 12:56.692
[bell ringing]

12:56.776 --> 12:57.693
[sighs]

12:57.777 --> 12:59.779
[indistinct chatter]

13:02.865 --> 13:04.909
[man]
Let's have the actors on their marks.

13:05.659 --> 13:08.204
[man 2] Jack Castello screen test.
Take one.

13:11.832 --> 13:14.543
If you don't mind, Mr. Alexander,
I'd prefer to be left alone.

13:14.627 --> 13:17.421
Why? So you can sit out here
and feel sorry for yourself?

13:17.505 --> 13:19.548
I should think you'd be happy
your sister married him

13:19.632 --> 13:21.050
and took him off your hands.

13:22.051 --> 13:23.803
Clay was pretending to love me.

25:42.624 --> 25:44.292
-You ain't white?
-Asian.

25:44.376 --> 25:45.210
No.

25:46.127 --> 25:46.962
Half.

25:47.462 --> 25:48.672
-You're shitting me.
-No.

25:48.922 --> 25:52.676
My whole life I feel like I've been living
in a really convincing costume.

25:52.759 --> 25:54.553
[scoffs] Yeah.

25:56.596 --> 25:57.764
But you could pass.

25:58.431 --> 25:59.891
That ain't like being black.

26:00.684 --> 26:02.852
-You sound like my girlfriend.
-Hold up.

26:04.729 --> 26:05.981
You're dating a sister?

26:08.650 --> 26:09.693
Wow.

26:10.402 --> 26:11.820
It's gotta be tough, though.

26:12.529 --> 26:15.115
-Can you go out together?
-Some places they don't mind.

26:15.198 --> 26:16.283
The world's changing.

26:17.075 --> 26:17.909
Maybe.

26:18.368 --> 26:19.911
But it ain't changing fast.

26:20.620 --> 26:22.539
So, Dick Samuels.

26:23.623 --> 26:24.541
You think he knows?

26:27.419 --> 26:28.253
Knows what?

26:29.421 --> 26:30.463
That I'm black.

26:32.132 --> 26:34.426
-He doesn't already know?
-I never met anybody in person.

26:35.468 --> 26:36.928
I mailed him my script,

26:37.345 --> 26:40.056
he called me on the telephone,
and I told him,

26:40.140 --> 26:43.310
"Golly, Mr. Samuels, I'm just
over the moon you like my script."

26:43.393 --> 26:46.938
-[laughing] You did not do that.
-I said, "Golly, Mr. Samuels."  I did.

26:48.565 --> 26:49.399
Well...

26:50.191 --> 26:53.111
[clears throat]
I hate to break it to you, buster, but...

26:54.279 --> 26:56.615
I'm pretty sure
he's gonna find out pretty soon.

26:56.698 --> 26:57.574
[both laughing]

26:57.657 --> 26:58.533
[Archie] Yes.

26:59.367 --> 27:01.369
You do that voice or not, he's gonna know.

27:04.456 --> 27:06.333
I'm glad I'm doing this with you, Raymond.

27:07.042 --> 27:08.877
I think you and I want the same thing.

27:09.294 --> 27:13.214
See, I wanna take the story of Hollywood
and give it a rewrite.

27:14.674 --> 27:17.969
So, maybe someday soon,
when you ain't a half-Asian director,

27:18.053 --> 27:19.471
who feels he has to hide it.

27:20.639 --> 27:21.973
You'll just be a director.

27:23.975 --> 27:27.228
I won't be a black writer writing about
some white lady.

27:28.104 --> 27:29.731
I'll just be a writer.

27:32.525 --> 27:34.152
Wouldn't that be something?

27:38.323 --> 27:39.157
To Peg.

27:43.203 --> 27:44.037
To Peg.

-Yeah.

28:21.491 --> 28:22.742
I'm glad you liked it.

28:23.618 --> 28:25.036
-I did too.
-Yeah.

28:25.328 --> 28:26.162
Yeah.

-[both chuckle]
-Can I ask you something?

28:37.048 --> 28:38.925
Why haven't you asked me to pay you yet?

28:39.426 --> 28:40.719
You don't pay me. You pay Ernie.

28:41.428 --> 28:43.722
Okay, well,
why hasn't Ernie told me to pay him?

28:44.431 --> 28:46.141
Because I haven't asked him to.

28:46.850 --> 28:48.184
Well, why is that?

28:48.268 --> 28:49.978
You like being with me, don't you?

28:50.729 --> 28:52.355
Yeah, I suppose I do.

28:53.773 --> 28:54.899
So what are we then?

28:55.859 --> 28:57.652
-Boyfriends?
-[Archie laughs]

28:58.820 --> 29:01.072
You're somebody I tricked twice
and didn't charge.

29:02.198 --> 29:03.116
Boyfriend.

29:03.616 --> 29:06.619
Can folks like you and me
even have a boyfriend?

29:07.078 --> 29:08.997
-I don't know. I'd hope so.
-Yeah?

29:09.706 --> 29:11.082
Well, I haven't seen it.

29:12.250 --> 29:14.544
A boyfriend's somebody you take out
on the town,

29:15.003 --> 29:16.463
show him off on your arm.

29:17.380 --> 29:18.882
You and I can't do that.

29:18.965 --> 29:22.010
In a molly house, maybe, sure,

29:22.093 --> 29:24.763
a couple queens clucking to each other,
hanging off the bar. Whee!

29:24.846 --> 29:26.473
But are they boyfriends?

29:27.140 --> 29:28.099
I wouldn't call it that.

29:29.559 --> 29:30.518
Boyfriend.

29:30.935 --> 29:32.061
That just ain't our destiny.

29:32.854 --> 29:34.564
-Yeah, but wouldn't it be nice?
-Would it?

29:35.231 --> 29:36.566
What's so nice about it?

29:37.442 --> 29:39.360
I don't know. Growing old with somebody.

29:39.444 --> 29:41.905
Not just someone to depend on
if you don't make it in this town,

29:41.988 --> 29:43.865
but even when you do,
someone to share it with.

29:44.491 --> 29:46.075
This place can get real lonely, Archie.

29:46.159 --> 29:48.077
I know. I wrote a whole script about it.

29:48.161 --> 29:49.954
That's what <i>Peg's</i> about,

29:50.747 --> 29:54.250
and how being surrounded by people
somehow makes the loneliness worse.

29:54.334 --> 29:55.251
That's what I'm saying.

29:55.335 --> 29:58.505
Wouldn't it be nice to have somebody to
fall back on when it's all said and done?

29:58.588 --> 30:00.465
Someone to look back on it with.

30:01.966 --> 30:02.801
Maybe.

30:04.385 --> 30:06.763
But we oughta be thinking
about making it first.

30:06.888 --> 30:09.849
Yeah, well, in that case, what are you--
What are you, in a hurry?

30:09.933 --> 30:11.476
I don't make much
spending time with you.

Hold on a sec.

she's trying to get in the club,
but I'm the bouncer

30:26.407 --> 30:28.284

not to let her in.

30:28.368 --> 30:30.203
[Archie] Okay. Let me see.

I'm here to see Joe.
The name's Andrea McCloud.

Mr. Cotton ain't takin' no visitors!

30:42.173 --> 30:43.383
Ooh. Okay.

30:45.134 --> 30:48.137
Maybe just throw it away
a little bit more, you know?

30:48.221 --> 30:49.347
-Throw it away.
-Yeah.

30:49.430 --> 30:50.640
Like, you're not angry.

30:50.932 --> 30:52.892
It's your job, throwing people out.

30:52.976 --> 30:55.812

"Kick rocks, toots.

30:58.773 --> 31:01.860

31:02.485 --> 31:04.404

I should do it like that.

No, no, that's your subtext.

but not saying.

-one of your contract players.
-Mm-hmm?

I know that Alfred Zeisler is casting
a new crime drama, <i>Parole, Inc.,</i>

32:05.673 --> 32:07.592
and there's a role for someone
my age in it.

32:07.675 --> 32:10.261
I was wondering
if I might be considered for it.

32:11.054 --> 32:11.888
No.

32:12.347 --> 32:13.556
That's a white role, honey.

we're looking down now,

we push in.

on the hillside in the dirt,

32:29.656 --> 32:32.533
and we tilt up
to the view from the Hollywood sign,

as far as the eye can see.

but... let's roll the dice.

could be my next picture?

Come on, Raymond.
I just changed your life.

33:15.868 --> 33:17.120

Still can't quite believe it myself.

33:34.137 --> 33:37.098
My screen test was terrible.
I gotta take classes and everything.

33:37.181 --> 33:39.475
Well, this is Hollywood, Jack Castello.

33:39.559 --> 33:42.145
If you want something,
you have to declare it.

33:42.228 --> 33:43.896
And it'll fall right in your lap.

33:44.522 --> 33:47.066
Don't say, "I gotta take classes."

they're about to green-light
a picture about Peg Entwistle,

34:10.673 --> 34:12.967
the nutcase who jumped off
the Hollywood sign.

34:13.342 --> 34:16.137
I'm perfect for it,
and I'm going to get an audition.

35:32.630 --> 35:34.257
You have any acting experience?

35:34.924 --> 35:35.758
No.

35:38.344 --> 35:39.720
Do you know something?

35:40.429 --> 35:44.600
In all my years as an agent,
you're the first one to ever admit that.

35:44.684 --> 35:45.726
[chuckles softly]

35:47.520 --> 35:48.354
Now sit.

35:52.984 --> 35:56.279
Today is your lucky day, Roy Fitzgerald.
I just decided...

35:57.738 --> 35:58.573
to sign you.

36:00.241 --> 36:03.244
[stammers] How is that possible?
You haven't seen any of my work.

36:03.619 --> 36:06.080
What work?
You just said you haven't done anything.

36:06.539 --> 36:08.166
You read for Anne Rogers last week.

36:08.249 --> 36:10.251
She's casting the Barbara Stanwyck picture
at MGM.

36:10.334 --> 36:12.837
Yeah, well, I wasn't sure it had gone
all that well--

36:12.920 --> 36:14.422
It didn't. She said you were terrible.

36:16.299 --> 36:17.717
You know what my talent is?

36:18.342 --> 36:22.805
I know in the first 30 seconds if
somebody's got what it takes to be a star,

36:22.889 --> 36:23.931
and you,

36:25.183 --> 36:27.268
believe it or not, you got it.

36:27.810 --> 36:29.937
You got picture potential.

36:30.396 --> 36:34.358
You're a big fella, but you're vulnerable,
so men won't find you threatening,

36:34.775 --> 36:37.445
and women and sissy boys will fantasize
about you fucking 'em.

36:38.279 --> 36:41.115
You're wholesome, you don't perspire.
No pimples.

36:41.199 --> 36:42.742
I mean, you smell like milk...

36:45.578 --> 36:47.914
and you got secrets churning
beneath the surface.

36:48.915 --> 36:49.874
That's good.

36:50.499 --> 36:51.959
Everything else we gotta work on.

36:52.043 --> 36:54.712
We're gonna beef you up,
and I don't mean eating hot dogs all day.

36:54.795 --> 36:57.757
I'm talking about calisthenics.
Charles Atlas kind of stuff.

36:57.840 --> 37:00.927
You gotta tan every day.
Quit picking at your fingernails.

37:01.010 --> 37:03.471
We'll get you drama lessons,
we'll fix your posture,

37:03.554 --> 37:05.306
and then that voice of yours...

37:05.806 --> 37:06.891
That's tinny.

37:07.141 --> 37:10.436
So next time you get a cold,
I want you to drive up into the mountains

37:10.519 --> 37:12.480
and holler like a banshee.

37:12.563 --> 37:14.023
That'll break your vocal cords,

37:14.106 --> 37:16.651
and when they heal,
you'll have a nice, low baritone.

37:16.734 --> 37:18.736
I should... maybe write this all down.

37:18.819 --> 37:20.279
Then there's the name.

37:20.821 --> 37:23.241
Roy Fitzgerald, that ain't gonna work.

37:24.575 --> 37:25.785
[Henry sighs]

37:26.327 --> 37:27.536
Something like...

37:31.832 --> 37:32.667
Rock.

37:39.006 --> 37:40.091
Rock Hudson.

37:41.884 --> 37:43.552
-Rock Hudson?
-Yeah.

37:45.054 --> 37:47.098
Rock Hudson's a movie star.

37:48.057 --> 37:50.768
-Strong like the Rock of Gibraltar.
-Ooh, uh--

37:50.851 --> 37:54.021
You don't like what you're hearing?
You can get the fuck out of my office.

37:54.105 --> 37:57.441
Farm boys don't just roll into Hollywood
and stumble into pictures.

37:57.525 --> 37:59.568
They need somebody
to show 'em the ropes,

37:59.652 --> 38:01.612
to give them a real life character

38:01.696 --> 38:04.365
that's every bit as scripted as any role
you'll ever play on screen.

38:04.448 --> 38:05.866
I won't just be your agent.

38:06.951 --> 38:08.160
I'll be your godfather.

38:08.786 --> 38:11.831
I tell you what to do.
You do it and pay me ten percent.

38:12.748 --> 38:14.709
If that sounds agreeable to you,

38:14.792 --> 38:17.086
you can just sign this contract
right here.

38:22.675 --> 38:24.468
Uh, okay, I like the sound of that.

38:24.552 --> 38:27.138
Yeah, I thought you might,
but before we do that...

38:28.931 --> 38:31.809
there is just one thing
that we gotta get outta the way.

38:37.189 --> 38:38.649
[Henry sighs]

38:41.319 --> 38:42.611
I need to suck your cock.

38:45.781 --> 38:46.949
Ex-- excuse me?

38:47.825 --> 38:49.285
It's my thing.

38:49.827 --> 38:50.786
I got to do it.

38:51.912 --> 38:52.955
Uh...

38:54.540 --> 38:55.958
Look, Mr. Willson...

38:56.042 --> 38:59.545
Don't sit there and pretend
to be all offended, sissy boy.

38:59.628 --> 39:01.589
You're a fruitcake, just like me.

39:01.672 --> 39:03.674
Saw it the moment you swished through
those doors.

39:03.758 --> 39:06.177
You can't hide it yet,
but I'll teach you how.

39:07.178 --> 39:09.889
You won't be a homosexual
once I'm through with you.

39:10.306 --> 39:11.432
So, in return,

39:12.224 --> 39:13.559
you're gonna drop your drawers

39:13.642 --> 39:16.687
and let me suck you dry
until your eyes cross, got it?

39:21.025 --> 39:22.526
I'm not going to ask again.

39:25.363 --> 39:27.365
[dramatic music playing]

39:28.032 --> 39:30.034
[breathing deeply]

39:41.837 --> 39:44.131
Mr. Ainsley, do come in.

39:47.927 --> 39:48.928
I spoke to my agent.

39:49.470 --> 39:51.847
He still thinks I'm delusional
because no one at the studio

39:51.931 --> 39:54.308
seems to know anything
about <i>Angel of Shanghai.</i>

39:57.436 --> 39:59.021
They're not making the picture.

40:01.524 --> 40:03.818
I'm obliged to direct another film first,

40:03.901 --> 40:05.945
but if it's a hit, then--

40:06.028 --> 40:07.696
The movie's not getting made.

40:08.948 --> 40:10.991
N-- not right now. Not yet, but...

40:12.118 --> 40:13.661
I'm going to insist.

40:13.744 --> 40:14.578
No.

40:16.372 --> 40:17.498
I'm telling you.

40:18.416 --> 40:19.959
The movie's not getting made.

40:21.419 --> 40:22.294
Not ever.

40:23.921 --> 40:27.216
This town will never give that
to someone like me.

40:29.009 --> 40:30.928
Someone who can't pass.

40:33.431 --> 40:35.349
I'm going to change that.

40:36.600 --> 40:38.227
Good luck with your movie.

41:04.879 --> 41:06.088
[door closes]

41:12.595 --> 41:14.054
[Archie] In your wildest dreams,

41:14.138 --> 41:17.558
did you ever think you'd have
your own parking spot on the studio lot?

41:17.683 --> 41:19.810
[Raymond] I don't know
what it says about me, but, uh,

41:19.894 --> 41:21.145
actually, yes, I did.

41:27.276 --> 41:28.319
Archie?

41:28.903 --> 41:30.821
-[chuckles]
-What the heck are you doing here?

41:30.905 --> 41:31.780
Jack...

41:32.239 --> 41:34.241
They're making my picture!

41:34.450 --> 41:36.452
You gotta be shitting me,
that's incredible!

41:36.535 --> 41:38.412
Yeah, this is Raymond Ainsley.
He's the director.

41:38.496 --> 41:39.455
Raymond, Jack Castello.

41:39.538 --> 41:41.457
Mr. Ainsley,
it's a real pleasure to meet you.

41:41.957 --> 41:44.502
-I just got put on a contract.
-Lying son of a bitch.

41:44.585 --> 41:46.754
No fooling,
I can hardly believe it myself.

41:47.046 --> 41:49.548
-So what's this picture?
-It's called <i>Peg.</i>

41:49.965 --> 41:50.799
<i>Peg.</i>

41:51.926 --> 41:52.760
<i>Peg.</i>

41:53.761 --> 41:55.471
Wow. Oh, wow.

41:55.930 --> 41:58.140
Listen, I don't know
if I'm supposed to do this, fellas,

41:58.224 --> 41:59.558
but could I walk you to lunch?

41:59.642 --> 42:01.352
I hear there's the part
of a love interest.

42:01.435 --> 42:03.562
Folks are telling me
I would be perfect for it.

42:03.646 --> 42:05.814
-Yeah, sure. Why not?
-Well, okay. Terrific!

42:05.898 --> 42:08.609
-Well, after you, Mr. Ainsley.
-Thanks kindly, Mr. Castello.

42:08.692 --> 42:10.694
Archie, it's so great to see you.

42:10.778 --> 42:12.321
Wow! The three of us together, huh?

42:12.404 --> 42:14.323
[Raymond]
So how do you fellas know each other?

42:14.406 --> 42:16.534
[Archie] Jack pumps gas with me
down at the station.

42:16.617 --> 42:18.285
He got me hired, as a matter of fact.

42:18.369 --> 42:20.913
You don't say. I can't imagine you'll be
pumping gas much longer.

42:20.996 --> 42:22.540
I don't know,
turned out to be a good gig.

42:22.623 --> 42:24.500
-Isn't that right, Archie?
-Best job I ever had. 

42:24.583 --> 42:26.669
-[Jack] I beg your pardon.
-Why, hello, Jack Castello.

42:26.752 --> 42:28.546
Let me introduce you to Avis Amberg.

42:29.004 --> 42:31.215
Mrs. Amberg's husband runs Ace Pictures.

42:31.757 --> 42:33.092
How do you do, Mrs. Amberg?

42:33.175 --> 42:36.303
May I introduce Raymond Ainsley?
He's directing <i>Peg.</i>

42:36.845 --> 42:38.097
Very nice to meet you.

42:38.347 --> 42:41.016
I've got some great casting ideas,
whenever you want to hear them.

42:41.100 --> 42:43.602
I can't wait.
This is our screenwriter, Archie Coleman.

42:43.727 --> 42:45.062
Pleasure to meet you both.

42:45.896 --> 42:46.855
You're colored.

42:48.482 --> 42:49.358
I love it.

42:51.735 --> 42:52.987
You be good, Jack.

43:04.748 --> 43:05.833
Well, boys...

43:07.293 --> 43:08.127
lunch is on me.

43:08.877 --> 43:11.380
[chuckling, chattering indistinctly]

43:24.727 --> 43:27.313
[big band music playing]
