I'm so happy you picked this dress, Veruca!

00:46.360 --> 00:48.360
You look beautiful. Doesn't she?

00:49.040 --> 00:50.800
You guys, I'm getting married!

00:50.840 --> 00:52.600
I'm getting married!

00:53.280 --> 00:56.280
Not without your veil, you're not.

00:56.720 --> 00:57.720
Where is that bad boy?

00:57.800 --> 00:59.080
Oh, I think I left it upstairs.

01:00.160 --> 01:02.920
Don't worry. I'll get it,

01:03.440 --> 01:04.680
sis.

01:09.560 --> 01:11.360
She is so annoying.

01:11.480 --> 01:13.040
And so ugly.

01:13.200 --> 01:14.960
She looks like Karl Malden.

01:15.160 --> 01:16.280
I know, and she's gonna be

01:16.360 --> 01:18.360
my sister-in-law in an hour!

01:18.520 --> 01:20.160
COLBY: How are you gonna deal with that?

01:20.280 --> 01:22.120
VERUCA: I'm just gonna lay down the law for Danny.

01:22.280 --> 01:25.800
We're seeing his goofy family as little as possible.

01:26.000 --> 01:27.440
DANA: You sure he's gonna go along with that?

01:27.520 --> 01:29.640
VERUCA: (SCOFFS) Danny doesn't say no to me.

01:29.720 --> 01:32.880
Believe me, I have him well-trained.

01:32.960 --> 01:34.120
(WOMEN LAUGHING)

01:34.200 --> 01:37.200
So, tell us, what happened with Eric last night?

01:37.280 --> 01:38.320
(SHUSHING)

01:39.840 --> 01:42.520
So, I told him if he wanted to stop the wedding,

01:42.640 --> 01:45.160
he had to speak now or forever hold his peace.

01:45.360 --> 01:46.680
And what'd he say?

01:46.800 --> 01:48.240
He said he's never gonna settle down,

01:48.320 --> 01:50.000
and I should just go ahead and marry Danny.

01:50.080 --> 01:51.160
(ALL EXCLAIM)

01:51.200 --> 01:53.080
Did he give you a wedding present, huh?

01:53.200 --> 01:54.480
You're so horny! Yeah.

01:55.320 --> 01:57.240
I guess you could call it that.

01:58.040 --> 01:59.680
DANA: You're so bad!

02:01.680 --> 02:03.840
(SHUSHING) It's the last time, I swear.

02:04.000 --> 02:05.160
Yeah, right!

02:05.320 --> 02:07.680
Danny is so sweet and considerate.

02:07.760 --> 02:09.759
And he's gonna be a cardiologist.

02:09.919 --> 02:11.680
So, I'm marrying him

02:11.720 --> 02:13.680
and that zucchini in the middle of his face.

02:13.920 --> 02:15.320
JANA: His parents are disgusting, too!

02:15.520 --> 02:17.320
COLBY: Close your eyes when he's on top!

02:17.520 --> 02:19.240
DANA: And your thighs!

02:21.040 --> 02:23.040
Cuz, I'm so sorry.

02:23.200 --> 02:24.840
DANNY: Yikes, that hurt.

02:25.000 --> 02:27.800
That was me, Danny Maccabee, 20 years ago.

02:27.840 --> 02:28.960
Pathetic, huh?

02:29.200 --> 02:30.320
(PEOPLE CHATTERING)

02:31.520 --> 02:34.280
So, I'm halfway done boozing away my sorrows,

02:34.400 --> 02:37.040
when something pretty interesting happened.

02:37.280 --> 02:40.280
Oh, baby, you're like a Pop Tart,

02:40.360 --> 02:42.360
hot and sweet!

(WHOOPING)

02:44.480 --> 02:45.560
Hey, mami!

02:45.760 --> 02:47.400
You must play the trumpet or something,

02:47.480 --> 02:50.640
'cause you're making me feel all horny and stuff!

02:54.240 --> 02:55.280
You dropped your purse.

02:55.400 --> 02:56.840
Can I just sit for 10 seconds

02:56.920 --> 02:59.160
and not get hit on? Thank you.

03:00.840 --> 03:03.920
I was just letting you know you dropped your purse.

03:05.960 --> 03:07.040
(GROANS)

03:07.120 --> 03:09.240
I'm sorry. I thought... That's fine, that's fine.

03:09.720 --> 03:11.840
I'm sure you didn't meet the
lady who gave you that ring

03:11.920 --> 03:13.720
in a meat market like this.

03:14.320 --> 03:15.440
School cafeteria.

03:15.800 --> 03:17.560
How long you been married?

03:18.480 --> 03:20.480
DANNY: I was gonna tell her, I really was.

03:21.400 --> 03:23.520
But I didn't want her to know what a loser I was,

03:23.600 --> 03:26.160
so I stretched the truth a little.

03:26.320 --> 03:27.320
Six years.

03:27.800 --> 03:29.160
Where's your wife tonight?

03:29.600 --> 03:33.240
I stopped asking that question a long time ago.

03:33.920 --> 03:35.040
That's terrible.

03:35.120 --> 03:36.800
My wife says I work too much.

03:36.920 --> 03:41.320
Trying to provide for her, her shopping addiction,

03:41.480 --> 03:42.800
and crack.

03:42.960 --> 03:44.640
Why don't you just leave her?

03:45.200 --> 03:46.600
The children.

03:47.520 --> 03:49.440
All 14 of them.

03:50.640 --> 03:53.000
I just, I like to adopt,

03:53.080 --> 03:55.440
and I don't wanna stop doing that.

03:56.120 --> 03:57.640
You poor guy.

03:58.040 --> 03:59.800
You wanna get outta here?

04:00.280 --> 04:01.760
DANNY: And so I discovered

04:01.800 --> 04:03.680
the power of the wedding ring.

04:03.800 --> 04:05.440
The symbol of my humiliation

04:05.520 --> 04:07.960
had become a tool to get back on the horse.

04:08.040 --> 04:10.800
Are you kidding me? Snuffleupagus!

04:11.360 --> 04:15.400
I switched my specialty from
cardiology to plastic surgery,

04:15.520 --> 04:17.320
got rid of the big honker,

04:17.399 --> 04:19.880
and the ring became my thing.

04:20.480 --> 04:24.320
I just assumed after we got married
she'd stop hooking, but...

04:25.160 --> 04:28.120
You need to put this wedding band on a true heart.

04:28.800 --> 04:30.720
This is a good moment.

04:31.520 --> 04:33.520
Yeah. Should we go make it last,

04:33.560 --> 04:34.720
for a while, somewhere?

04:34.880 --> 04:37.800
Okay, let's go. To your dorm.

04:40.480 --> 04:41.680
DANNY: Sometimes I think about

04:41.760 --> 04:43.320
throwing the ring into the ocean.

04:43.400 --> 04:45.880
I know how wrong it is. But I can't.

04:49.880 --> 04:51.760
Besides, being fake married

04:51.840 --> 04:53.480
is the perfect way to make sure

05:08.200 --> 05:09.360
What are these?

05:16.200 --> 05:18.160

05:18.840 --> 05:22.200
These are not the boobie bags that I ordered.

05:22.560 --> 05:23.560
What is that?

It's like a syrup dispenser at an IHOP.

I don't know what that is.

05:26.600 --> 05:29.240
Come on. These, they don't feel like these.

No... Seriously?

Listen, Dr. Maccabee would
never accept subpar boobs.

05:38.480 --> 05:40.200
Would you please just get me what I ordered

05:40.280 --> 05:42.840
and tell Omar that I would like a
discount for the inconvenience?

05:42.920 --> 05:44.880

Questions?

06:05.920 --> 06:08.480
No, no. Just, please help me, Doctor.

06:08.680 --> 06:10.880
Absolutely. It's usually easier

06:10.960 --> 06:13.640
to do these things right the first time, but...

06:15.400 --> 06:16.600
What? You seem dubious.

06:16.680 --> 06:17.680
Hmm?

Oh, no, not at all.

I mean, I hear you're the best, Dr. Maccabee.

06:21.440 --> 06:23.000

That's relaxed? Hmm.

back up there. (SNICKERS)

Oh, my God! It's just...

06:45.520 --> 06:48.640
That just really went right up there.

06:48.800 --> 06:50.560
That was high. You gotta watch that.

06:50.640 --> 06:52.640
It's gonna get caught in your hair.

06:54.360 --> 06:56.200
I don't know, maybe I should just keep it like this.

06:56.440 --> 06:57.800
It seems to make other people happy.

for my kid's birthday party?

anybody else. There you go.

07:34.720 --> 07:36.040
but whoever they are,

07:36.200 --> 07:40.080
they don't have what this guy's got down
there, you know what I mean?

07:40.200 --> 07:41.440
All right, Eddie.

07:41.520 --> 07:44.480
Yeah, it's a very good one. I should know, I installed it.

07:44.600 --> 07:46.080
Oh, you had a penile enlargement?

Yes.

about my surgery?

Katherine was in the room when I did that.

08:06.000 --> 08:07.560
She held the magnifying glass.

08:07.640 --> 08:09.280
I did. And the tweezer.

Real nice.

08:10.800 --> 08:12.320
Did you get a chance to try it out yet?

Uh, yeah. I've banged it up.

08:39.919 --> 08:42.200
I didn't bring the Botox. I brought my cousin, Eddie.

10:15.080 --> 10:16.360
You're getting a little nutty over there.

10:16.440 --> 10:18.040
(EXCLAIMS) No! No, I'm good. I'm good.

10:18.440 --> 10:21.400
I'm alive! I'm alive, everybody!

10:31.600 --> 10:34.600
Good job, Doctor. That was really nice.

10:34.800 --> 10:36.640
The distraction, I'm guessing.

10:36.800 --> 10:37.800
The what?

10:37.880 --> 10:40.520
The boy was distracted. That's why he fell.

10:41.120 --> 10:42.880
So, I'm taking the rap for this.

10:43.000 --> 10:45.600
Yes. Your hotness basically pushed
him down the stairs.

10:45.720 --> 10:47.400
Good luck proving that in court, Wisengruber.

10:47.600 --> 10:49.200
Wisengruber? Is that what they're saying

10:49.280 --> 10:50.640
on the Gossip Girl nowadays?

10:51.440 --> 10:54.000
I knew you two would eventually find each other!

10:54.080 --> 10:56.880
But be careful, Palmer, these plastic surgeons,

10:57.000 --> 10:59.280
they really know how to operate.

10:59.320 --> 11:00.440
(STRAINED LAUGHING)

11:01.080 --> 11:03.520
Yeah, all right, Adon. All right.

11:07.920 --> 11:10.360
PALMER: I just don't know about plastic surgery.

11:10.400 --> 11:12.000
I mean, doesn't it always look so fake?

11:12.160 --> 11:14.320
Depends who's doing it. I'm pretty
good at it. I'm telling you.

11:14.400 --> 11:16.400
Some of my patients are here tonight. Oh, really?

11:16.480 --> 11:17.520
Really, really. Look around,

11:17.600 --> 11:21.000
see if you can find someone decent-looking.

11:21.680 --> 11:23.160
How 'bout her?

11:23.360 --> 11:24.800
The lady from Saw?

11:25.840 --> 11:27.320
Fine. Who did you do?

11:27.880 --> 11:29.440
All right. I hate to rat the guy out,

11:29.520 --> 11:31.360
but see that guy over there?

11:31.760 --> 11:33.360
You mean Sexy Ass?

11:33.800 --> 11:36.000
Before I met him, he was No Buns Bobby.

11:36.080 --> 11:37.200
Really?

11:37.360 --> 11:39.400
His back went straight to his legs. No kidding.

11:39.560 --> 11:40.560
He'd go to the bathroom,

11:40.640 --> 11:41.720
he'd slide right in the toilet.

11:42.720 --> 11:45.320
I know, I know, that's really romantic, isn't it?

11:46.320 --> 11:49.000
So, North Carolina, how long
have you lived here in LA?

11:49.040 --> 11:50.520
I've been here almost two years.

11:50.600 --> 11:53.040
Uh-huh. That's a lot of auditioning for you.

11:53.480 --> 11:54.640
You think I'm an actress?

11:54.720 --> 11:56.040
I guarantee you're an actress.

11:56.200 --> 11:58.880
Well, guess again, Doc. I teach sixth grade math.

11:59.280 --> 12:02.200
They got no schools in North Carolina to teach at?

12:03.000 --> 12:05.680
My parents divorced.

12:05.760 --> 12:07.120
Had a pretty nasty one, actually,

12:07.160 --> 12:08.760
when I was in the eighth grade. Mmm-hmm.

12:08.920 --> 12:13.320
And... I don't know. I got tired of picking sides, so...

12:13.360 --> 12:17.840
Okay. I thought I'd make a change
and, yeah, move out to LA.

12:18.280 --> 12:20.680
You came to the right place.
No one gets divorced in LA.

12:20.760 --> 12:22.000
Mmm-hmm.

12:23.240 --> 12:26.720
I've never hung out with a girl your age. This is nice.

12:27.520 --> 12:29.960
Oh, no. Your first lie to me.

12:30.400 --> 12:32.360
You're good. All right.

12:32.600 --> 12:35.720
I've never hung out with a girl your age and

12:36.080 --> 12:38.720
connected the way we are right now.

12:38.880 --> 12:41.040
Actually, I've never connected with,

12:41.120 --> 12:43.080
I don't think any girl at any age.

12:44.440 --> 12:46.160
See? I can tell when you're lying

12:46.240 --> 12:48.280
and when you're telling the truth. Oh.

12:49.120 --> 12:52.120
Yeah. The second thing I said was the truth.

12:52.560 --> 12:53.720
I know.

13:05.480 --> 13:09.040
Oh, my God. That was the greatest night of my life.

13:09.600 --> 13:13.280
Yeah. This feels like it could be...

13:13.960 --> 13:15.760
I don't know, a real thing.

13:17.160 --> 13:19.400
It's a thing all right, Palmer.

13:19.680 --> 13:21.360
Well, I have to get to work,

13:21.520 --> 13:22.760
but how 'bout I take your number

13:23.000 --> 13:26.120
and then you can take me out
on a proper date next time?

13:26.760 --> 13:30.320
I got a business card in my pocket
if you wanna get that.

13:30.840 --> 13:32.640
You better call. (LAUGHING)

13:32.720 --> 13:34.840
You better not just, just leave me hanging.

13:35.440 --> 13:36.880
I'd get it for you myself,

13:36.960 --> 13:39.040
but I don't want you to see me naked in the daylight.

13:39.120 --> 13:41.000
It could be a deal breaker.

13:46.120 --> 13:47.320
What's this?

13:48.680 --> 13:50.120
A circle?

13:50.320 --> 13:52.920
A wedding ring? You're married?

13:53.120 --> 13:55.320
No, no, no, I'm not, I'm not married.

13:55.840 --> 13:58.600
That is a... That is... That's not mine.

13:59.200 --> 14:02.000
Whose wedding ring is in your pants, Danny?

14:02.480 --> 14:06.120
All right, listen, just give me a minute to explain this.

14:06.400 --> 14:07.520
Please.

14:08.520 --> 14:09.840
It's gonna take more than a minute.

14:10.000 --> 14:11.360
I am such an idiot!

14:11.440 --> 14:12.640
No, no, no, no, no.

14:12.720 --> 14:14.560
Don't call me!

14:14.800 --> 14:16.280
No, Palmer!

14:18.640 --> 14:19.760
(GROANS)

14:19.840 --> 14:22.560
I told you that this whole fake marriage thing

14:22.640 --> 14:24.560
was just gonna come and bite you in the ass.

14:24.720 --> 14:26.400
Why don't you just tell her the truth?

14:26.640 --> 14:28.360
You think I can tell her the truth?

14:29.160 --> 14:30.960
Let me practice. You be her right now.

14:31.200 --> 14:32.840
Oh, good. Okay, hold on.

14:34.840 --> 14:37.240
Okay. She's not like that, but anyways.

14:37.320 --> 14:41.240
Um, I wear this fake wedding ring sometimes...

14:41.320 --> 14:42.360
You're a pig.

14:42.640 --> 14:43.600
(GROANS)

14:43.680 --> 14:46.360
Sorry. You're a pig.

14:46.480 --> 14:48.480
What's wrong? You're walking really weird.

14:48.680 --> 14:50.800
My back. I slept on the beach last night.

14:50.880 --> 14:52.000
God Almighty.

14:52.080 --> 14:53.920
When are you gonna strengthen your spine?

14:54.360 --> 14:55.720
Seriously, Flomax.

14:55.800 --> 14:57.720
You gotta work out more than once a month.

14:57.760 --> 14:59.320
I can't, I don't have time to work out.

14:59.400 --> 15:00.920
You do. You can't say that, Danny.

15:01.080 --> 15:04.160
My mother always said Cary Grant
never went to the gym.

15:04.280 --> 15:07.240
Only took the stairs, every day, never an elevator.

15:07.360 --> 15:09.840
You wanna hear my impression
of Cary Grant's butler? Nuh-uh.

15:09.920 --> 15:10.960
Watch. What?

15:11.040 --> 15:13.360
Hello? No, he's dead.

15:13.520 --> 15:15.120
Okay, bye-bye.

15:15.680 --> 15:16.880
That's good. That's funny.

15:16.960 --> 15:18.240
Mom, give me some money.

15:18.880 --> 15:20.720
Hi. How are you?

15:20.800 --> 15:22.040
Nice to see you, kids.

15:22.120 --> 15:24.080
Please be polite and say hello to Dr. Maccabee.

15:24.360 --> 15:25.600
(IN ENGLISH ACCENT) 'Ello, Dr. Danny.

15:25.680 --> 15:27.120
'Ow is you today?

15:27.440 --> 15:28.960
Is that my associate, Dr. Doolittle?

15:29.040 --> 15:30.240
Why is she talking like that?

15:30.360 --> 15:32.400
She's been working on some accents.

15:32.480 --> 15:35.640
I am takin' an acting class this summer, I is.

15:35.800 --> 15:38.360
Gonna be the next Miley Cyrus, I am.

15:38.560 --> 15:40.960
How 'bout you, young man? Do
you like Hannah Montana?

15:41.080 --> 15:42.960
No. I like Californication.

15:43.080 --> 15:45.800
When do you ever watch Californication?

15:46.120 --> 15:48.960
Rosa lets us watch Showtime
when she calls her boyfriend.

15:49.400 --> 15:52.160
Eat the mushroom! Eat the mushroom! Yes!

15:52.840 --> 15:54.880
Mmm. You run a tight ship at home, huh?

15:55.080 --> 15:56.240
MICHAEL: Dr. Danny?

15:56.520 --> 15:57.560
Yeah?

15:57.640 --> 16:00.400
Will you take me to Hawaii so
I can swim with the dolphins?

16:00.600 --> 16:03.000
Take you to Hawaii? No.

16:03.400 --> 16:05.680
I saw a show on the Discovery Channel.

16:05.840 --> 16:07.760
They say in Hawaii they have dolphins

16:07.800 --> 16:09.440
that you can swim with if you pay money.

16:09.760 --> 16:10.760
Okay.

16:10.960 --> 16:13.640
But I don't have any money. And
my mom says you're rich.

16:13.920 --> 16:15.640
Michael! No, it's fine.

16:15.840 --> 16:17.840
Maybe you should make your own money.

16:17.920 --> 16:20.000
Maybe a paper route or something like that?

16:20.160 --> 16:23.800
'Cause rich people don't give other people trips.

16:23.920 --> 16:25.920
That's why they remain rich. You understand?

16:26.120 --> 16:29.480
But my mom says you do charity for kids all the time.

16:29.840 --> 16:34.960
I do charity work like I fix a cleft
lip or a child's deformity.

16:35.120 --> 16:38.080
I don't take them to Hawaii.
I could get arrested for that.

16:38.320 --> 16:41.520
What if I was deformed? Then
would you take me to Hawaii?

16:42.120 --> 16:44.080
If you were deformed, I'd bring you to Hawaii,

16:44.160 --> 16:46.720
but I'd leave you there, 'cause
I wouldn't want to look at you.

16:46.840 --> 16:48.640
Okay. Here's the money, and I want change.

16:48.880 --> 16:49.920
And I wanna hear back

16:50.000 --> 16:52.040
that you actually ate the food that I am paying for.

16:52.720 --> 16:55.480
Mom, before we go, can I make a Devlin?

16:55.640 --> 16:58.200
Sure. Down the hall. Will you please go with him?

16:58.360 --> 17:01.040
We open in five minutes and I am
not having him sit there forever.

17:01.120 --> 17:03.120
Bloody hell right, I will, Mumsy!

17:03.320 --> 17:05.359
All right, Winston Churchill.

17:05.520 --> 17:06.800
He said, "I gotta make a Devlin."

17:06.880 --> 17:08.720
What does that mean? Uh...

17:08.800 --> 17:12.400
It's just a friend of mine who
was in my sorority in college

17:12.560 --> 17:14.920
named Devlin Adams, and...

17:15.359 --> 17:17.319
Well, I wouldn't say friend. I'd say more my nemesis.

17:17.480 --> 17:19.560
Oh, so she was a frenemy? Yes.

17:20.200 --> 17:22.359
You'd probably like her. She's really, really fake.

17:22.440 --> 17:23.520
Ah.

17:23.599 --> 17:25.359
Always had to have the coolest clothes

17:25.440 --> 17:28.079
and the hottest boys and, you know...

17:28.240 --> 17:30.320
She bothers you. A lot.

17:30.400 --> 17:33.040
So, one night, I was just having a glass of wine.

17:33.160 --> 17:35.000
A bottle. A bottle.

17:35.080 --> 17:36.280
And, uh...

17:36.760 --> 17:39.520
And I just got so tired of the kids saying things like,

17:39.600 --> 17:40.920
"I gotta take a crap.

17:41.080 --> 17:42.520
"I gotta take a dump."

17:42.720 --> 17:45.800
So, I told them that it was called "making a Devlin,"

17:45.880 --> 17:47.280
and they liked it.

17:47.360 --> 17:48.360
And it stuck.

17:49.200 --> 17:50.840
I always call it making a black pickle.

17:50.920 --> 17:52.680
Making a what? I don't say that.

17:52.800 --> 17:54.600
Out loud? Good. To others. No.

17:55.040 --> 17:56.600
What are we gonna do about my love life, though?

17:56.760 --> 17:59.880
Oh, Danny, I would feel terrible for you if I had any,

18:00.200 --> 18:02.200
even the slightest, investment in you

18:02.280 --> 18:03.760
successfully banging 23-year-olds.

18:04.280 --> 18:06.440
Holy Devlin, you're not listening to me.

18:06.640 --> 18:10.040
This is like not some bull-Devlin fling.

18:10.120 --> 18:11.680
I mean, I'm serious.

18:11.760 --> 18:13.280
This is the real Devlin. I could...

18:14.400 --> 18:16.640
I swear to God, I could see myself
ending up with this girl.

18:17.120 --> 18:18.080
Oh.

18:19.560 --> 18:21.200
You're right. You can't tell her the truth.

18:21.320 --> 18:22.480
High score!

18:22.640 --> 18:24.440
Oh, God. Sorry.

18:25.400 --> 18:26.560
I'm glad someone's doing good.

18:26.680 --> 18:27.840
(CHUCKLING)

18:27.920 --> 18:29.880
You know what? You don't wanna get serious,

18:29.960 --> 18:32.160
'cause when you get serious, that leads to marriage,

18:32.320 --> 18:34.800
and then marriage leads to divorce,
and divorce is just...

18:34.880 --> 18:35.960
I mean, look at these poor kids.

18:36.480 --> 18:38.600
You know, their dad was supposed
to pick them up today.

18:38.680 --> 18:40.080
He was a no-show? Again.

18:40.280 --> 18:41.440
But you know what?

18:41.520 --> 18:44.000
At least I got my head together and I divorced him.

18:44.160 --> 18:45.440
Yeah, yeah.

18:47.920 --> 18:49.080
Wait a minute.

18:49.360 --> 18:50.920
(SCHOOL BELL RINGING)

18:56.200 --> 18:57.480
You go ahead without me.

18:57.880 --> 18:58.880
Oh, no, no, no.

18:58.960 --> 19:00.360
Palmer, Palmer, Palmer, Palmer, Palmer.

19:00.520 --> 19:01.960
I told you I didn't want to see you.

19:02.120 --> 19:03.760
I just want to explain something to you.

19:03.920 --> 19:06.080
Let me explain something to you.

19:06.160 --> 19:07.480
(KIDS EXCLAIMING)

19:08.680 --> 19:10.440
I do not date married men.

19:10.640 --> 19:12.280
My father cheated on my mom when I was young.

19:12.360 --> 19:14.160
I am not going to be the other woman!

19:14.320 --> 19:16.200
Adulterer! Fornicator!

19:16.520 --> 19:18.480
All right, take it easy, Damien, all right?

19:18.600 --> 19:20.440
Okay, his name is Silas, leave him out of this.

19:20.960 --> 19:22.960
I'll kill you.

19:23.200 --> 19:25.040
What? Anytime!

19:26.040 --> 19:27.960
Listen! I am married.

19:28.280 --> 19:30.400
But it is a horrible marriage.

19:30.480 --> 19:32.200
She doesn't even talk to me anymore.

19:32.480 --> 19:33.960
Danny, that's what all married men say.

19:34.360 --> 19:36.160
If it's so bad, why don't you get divorced?

19:36.400 --> 19:37.560
I am.

19:39.320 --> 19:41.720
You are? Yes! It's over.

19:42.040 --> 19:43.600
Oh, my God, I can't believe this.

19:43.680 --> 19:45.080
I destroyed a marriage!

19:45.280 --> 19:47.360
I really feel like I'm gonna be sick. I can't...

19:47.480 --> 19:49.440
No, no, it wasn't 'cause of you!

19:49.520 --> 19:51.520
I filed a long, long time ago.

19:51.920 --> 19:54.960
We're gonna sign the papers in a couple of days

19:55.040 --> 19:57.120
and it's like, she's dead to me.

19:57.400 --> 19:58.520
What's her name?

19:58.760 --> 20:00.040
Mrs. Maccabee.

20:01.240 --> 20:05.360
You mean her first name? Her first name is Devlin.

20:06.240 --> 20:07.600
Her name's Devlin?

20:07.840 --> 20:10.520
Isn't that a shitty name? Yeah, yeah, yeah.

20:10.760 --> 20:14.480
But Devlin and I are splitting up, fortunately,

20:14.720 --> 20:18.880
'cause I caught her cheating on me with another guy.

20:19.000 --> 20:20.080
I didn't catch her.

20:20.200 --> 20:24.280
The television show Cheaters caught her and the guy.

20:25.240 --> 20:26.640
And I told them not to air it, though,

20:26.720 --> 20:28.880
because it's too painful.

20:28.960 --> 20:31.200
They actually burned the tape so you can't see it.

20:31.280 --> 20:32.920
But I would love you to.

20:33.360 --> 20:34.920
There's another man?

20:35.240 --> 20:37.920
There's another guy, yes. Dolph.

20:38.440 --> 20:39.560
Dolph?

20:39.600 --> 20:42.440
Dolph Lundgren. Yeah.

20:42.680 --> 20:44.120
Like the guy from Rocky IV?

20:44.280 --> 20:46.840
No, no, a different Dolph Lundgren.

20:47.120 --> 20:49.280
Apparently, if you bring that one up,

20:49.360 --> 20:51.800
this one gets really angry, so don't.

20:51.960 --> 20:53.880
Danny, guys always say they're
gonna leave their wives.

20:53.960 --> 20:55.040
They never do.

20:55.120 --> 20:57.280
I'm telling you, she's happy with this Dolph guy,

20:57.360 --> 20:59.520
good for her. Now I wanna be happy.

20:59.600 --> 21:01.880
And the only way I can be happy is if I'm with you!

21:01.960 --> 21:03.040
All right?

21:03.560 --> 21:06.480
Just wanna be able to be with you

21:06.560 --> 21:08.320
and not be called a "fornicator"

21:08.400 --> 21:10.080
or an "adulterer" or whatever that

21:10.160 --> 21:11.920
Children of the Corn kid was calling me.

21:12.600 --> 21:13.640
Okay.

21:13.760 --> 21:14.800
Okay?

21:15.160 --> 21:16.800
I just need to hear it from her.

21:18.000 --> 21:20.240
How about if she texts you, would that be good?

21:20.640 --> 21:21.720
I need to meet her.

21:27.520 --> 21:28.920
Let's do it.

21:29.280 --> 21:31.480
KATHERINE: You want me to be
your wife? DANNY: Uh-huh.

21:31.560 --> 21:33.600
And you couldn't think of another
name, other than Devlin?

21:33.680 --> 21:36.280
I practically took a Devlin in my
pants when she asked me.

21:36.360 --> 21:37.480
"What's her name?" I got panicked.

21:37.560 --> 21:38.600
I get nervous around this girl.

21:38.680 --> 21:39.840
You got panicked?

21:39.920 --> 21:42.080
You who invents a fake wife every Friday night?

21:42.160 --> 21:43.360
Yeah. Doesn't that say something

21:43.400 --> 21:44.640
about what I feel about this girl?

21:44.760 --> 21:45.920
Have you ever thought about the time

21:46.000 --> 21:47.840
that she's actually gonna walk
into your office... Uh-huh.

21:47.960 --> 21:52.000
...and sees that I'm your assistantlreceptionist?

21:52.160 --> 21:53.840
So easy. I'm a plastic surgeon,

21:53.920 --> 21:55.280
you will never look like you again.

21:55.480 --> 21:57.320
Snip, snap. Chip, chap. What are you talking about?

21:57.440 --> 21:59.000
I'm kidding. I'll get you a fake mustache.

21:59.080 --> 22:02.040
Oh, my God, you've really, really
not thought this through.

22:02.120 --> 22:05.000
Will you please just look at some clothes?

22:05.120 --> 22:06.840
Look at that. I don't wear...

22:06.920 --> 22:08.320
I have clothes, by the way.

22:08.360 --> 22:09.720
I do not need to do any of this. I'm fine.

22:09.840 --> 22:11.600
Yes. You have the best clothes that Old Navy sells.

22:11.720 --> 22:13.680
I'm just saying you gotta look
like a plastic surgeon's wife.

22:13.800 --> 22:16.160
I want to create the illusion I had a hot first wife.

22:16.280 --> 22:17.640
You're so... Not this!

22:17.720 --> 22:19.360
Okay, come on, let's go, you asked for it.

22:19.440 --> 22:20.480
I'm ready.

22:24.840 --> 22:26.960
Wow! These are... Oh, geez.

22:27.040 --> 22:28.080
Nice, nice.

22:28.160 --> 22:31.200
It's just been a while since I've been in heels, sorry.

22:31.360 --> 22:33.320
Okay, okay. Oh, gosh. Okay.

22:33.480 --> 22:35.200
Get there. Yeah, great.

22:35.320 --> 22:38.720
Oh, my God! These are gorgeous!

22:39.000 --> 22:41.040
How much are these? $1,700.

22:41.360 --> 22:43.800
$1,700? What, do you come with them?

22:44.840 --> 22:48.000
My parents' house costs $1,700. No, no.

22:49.200 --> 22:50.840
No. What, did Mickey Mantle sign those?

22:50.920 --> 22:53.040
Why are they $1,700, they made outta panda?

22:53.200 --> 22:54.520
Walk away. Yeah. You know what?

22:54.680 --> 22:56.400
We won't really be needing them anyway.

22:56.560 --> 22:58.360
'Cause I'm actually starting to...

22:58.520 --> 23:02.000
I'm actually starting to feel not
so hot. Is it warm in here?

23:02.200 --> 23:04.440
Whoo. I'm not sure I'll be able to make it this evening.

23:05.080 --> 23:08.160
Very good. Okay, you know what? We'll take them.

23:09.280 --> 23:11.440
It's your Christmas bonus. Oh, really?

23:11.520 --> 23:13.280
Okay, then I would like them in blue, too.

23:13.360 --> 23:16.040
In case a heel breaks or I just want to cuddle.

23:16.200 --> 23:18.080
It's beautiful. You sicken me.

23:18.360 --> 23:20.120
Yes, well, that's why we're getting a divorce.

23:20.200 --> 23:23.360
We're getting a divorce because you're
greedy, schemy and selfish.

23:23.640 --> 23:25.000
(STUTTERS)

23:25.080 --> 23:27.760
Actually, I think you need to
get the matching bag, too.

23:27.920 --> 23:29.720
Yeah, I think I should.

23:29.880 --> 23:31.600
Mmm. Thank you, Laurie. I agree.

23:31.800 --> 23:33.600
All the girls are sticking together. Isn't that sweet?

23:33.680 --> 23:35.240
Mmm-hmm. She's on your side, what a shock.

23:35.480 --> 23:37.120
You asked for this. Trust me.

23:37.200 --> 23:38.360
Uh-huh. You asked for this. (EXCLAIMS)

23:40.280 --> 23:42.320
(UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING)

24:07.000 --> 24:08.040
No.

24:09.840 --> 24:10.880
No.

24:17.120 --> 24:20.720
Hell, no! No, no, no!

24:20.800 --> 24:21.920
What do you mean, no?

24:22.120 --> 24:23.480
No? No what?

24:23.640 --> 24:26.760
No hope. Okay? There's only one word for it.

24:26.960 --> 24:29.120
What is it? Neglect.

24:29.840 --> 24:31.240
Okay? This is the one word

24:31.320 --> 24:32.680
for the whole thing. Are you the husband?

24:32.840 --> 24:35.120
I'm the soon to be ex-husband.

24:35.280 --> 24:36.440
We're getting a divorce.

24:36.640 --> 24:37.880
Well, you know he's not divorcing you.

24:37.960 --> 24:39.120
He's divorcing your head.

24:39.280 --> 24:41.120
True 'dat, Ernesto. Right on the money.

24:41.280 --> 24:42.640
Your hair is so messed up, I don't even...

24:42.720 --> 24:43.800
Let me count the ways.

24:43.960 --> 24:46.920
It's dull, it's dead, it's flat.

24:47.040 --> 24:48.240
Don't forget smelly.

24:48.320 --> 24:49.680
It don't smell, particularly...

24:49.760 --> 24:51.200
Okay, I think we got it. You bad.

24:51.320 --> 24:53.600
You is bad. Give me a little bit. That's bad, though.

24:53.680 --> 24:57.720
You guys, come on, seriously.
Ernesto, can you just, please

24:57.800 --> 24:59.480
do something, so we can be home

24:59.560 --> 25:00.560
and I can get out of here?

25:00.640 --> 25:02.720
Hurricane Katrina could do something, baby.

25:02.800 --> 25:04.040
I'm gonna do something transcendent.

25:04.160 --> 25:06.320
Katya! Yuri, Mrs. Hwiggins!

25:06.400 --> 25:07.600
We going in deep, y'all.

25:09.560 --> 25:11.040
You seem nervous, Danny.

25:11.200 --> 25:12.320
No, no, I just...

25:12.400 --> 25:14.240
It's weird, she gets me very tense.

25:14.400 --> 25:15.840
I'm sorry to put you through this.

25:16.000 --> 25:17.400
No, I understand why we're doing this.

25:17.520 --> 25:19.520
I'm just looking forward to getting
past this part of my life

25:19.640 --> 25:21.400
and moving on to the good part.

25:21.520 --> 25:25.000
We will. Soon. Tonight.

25:25.080 --> 25:26.520
Good God, yes.

25:26.800 --> 25:28.440
(UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING)

25:45.680 --> 25:47.520
Is that her?

25:48.200 --> 25:49.520
I think so.

25:52.720 --> 25:54.080
She's stunning.

25:54.880 --> 25:56.760
I love her shoes.

25:56.920 --> 25:59.160
Yeah, well, she got about five pairs of them.

25:59.240 --> 26:00.400
Maybe she'll give you one.

26:01.920 --> 26:03.320
Henderson!

26:03.360 --> 26:05.560
Do you see Dr. Maccabee anywhere in this...

26:06.280 --> 26:07.840
Oh! There he is.

26:07.920 --> 26:09.560
Keep the car running, shan't be long.

26:10.560 --> 26:11.760
Hello, boring!

26:11.920 --> 26:13.560
Hey. You went with a limo driver?

26:13.720 --> 26:15.240
I'm just playing the part.

26:15.440 --> 26:16.720
Okay.

26:17.200 --> 26:19.440
Palmer! Hi.

26:19.760 --> 26:22.280
Devlin Maccabee. Soon to be, single-abee.

26:23.960 --> 26:27.120
Waiter! Excuse me. Anybody?

26:27.240 --> 26:29.560
Yes, yes. Something to drink, madam?

26:29.920 --> 26:31.040
Well, hello.

26:31.120 --> 26:33.120
I would like a tall glass of you.

26:33.200 --> 26:35.120
Is that possible? Meow!

26:36.240 --> 26:38.800
I'm just kidding. Unless you're really into it.

26:40.120 --> 26:42.200
Kidding again. No, I'm not.

26:42.920 --> 26:44.560
We don't know. Grey Goose martinis,

26:44.600 --> 26:46.960
just keep 'em coming. Okay. Ooh!

26:47.400 --> 26:49.920
Make that a dirty martini. Okay?

26:50.000 --> 26:51.160
Okay, that was a good one.

26:51.320 --> 26:53.840
Well, so, Palmer.

26:53.960 --> 26:55.360
I heard you and Danny had sex.

26:59.280 --> 27:03.000
Yes. I am so sorry, I had...

27:03.160 --> 27:05.640
Please, honey, it is fine.

27:05.920 --> 27:09.320
I'm just happy to hear that his thing-a-ding
can still ring-a-ding.

27:09.440 --> 27:12.840
'Cause he's got a serious small issue

27:13.960 --> 27:15.720
with ED. Over here.

27:15.800 --> 27:16.920
Okay.

27:17.000 --> 27:18.480
What's ED? I don't...

27:18.640 --> 27:20.680
Oh, gosh. I forgot. You're fifteen.

27:22.520 --> 27:25.840
Erectile dysfunction, my darling.

27:26.200 --> 27:27.240
Think about it as if

27:27.320 --> 27:30.040
you're trying to throw darts and you just...

27:30.160 --> 27:32.080
All you really got, you're shooting with,

27:32.160 --> 27:33.640
like, overcooked spaghetti.

27:33.720 --> 27:34.840
Okay. Yeah.

27:35.200 --> 27:37.520
I just think that my spaghetti wasn't loving

27:37.600 --> 27:39.200
the meatballs that was being served.

27:39.320 --> 27:41.920
They were a little too lumpy. Oh.

27:42.480 --> 27:44.600
I've heard from a lot of men that I serve

27:44.680 --> 27:47.720
the finest meatballs in Southern California.

27:48.000 --> 27:51.880
Of course. A lot of homeless men have said this.

27:52.040 --> 27:54.440
They'll eat anything, you know.
(LAUGHS SARCASTICALLY)

27:54.680 --> 27:56.880
I'm just very shocked that you remember

27:56.960 --> 27:58.560
anybody you've ever been with.

27:58.640 --> 28:00.880
With all the pills that are in your system.

28:01.520 --> 28:02.880
She likes the pills, this one.

28:03.080 --> 28:04.640
At night I come home, "What's for dinner?"

28:04.880 --> 28:08.240
"Well, we have purple pills, and the green ones

28:08.320 --> 28:10.880
"and some lovely yellow bombers

28:10.960 --> 28:12.680
"I just took out of the oven."

28:12.840 --> 28:13.920
Remember that?

28:15.400 --> 28:17.600
I had to do something to amuse myself

28:17.720 --> 28:21.080
while this one sat on the throne for hours

28:21.160 --> 28:23.240
dealing with his irritable bowel syndrome.

28:23.520 --> 28:25.280
I got another disease. Okay.

28:25.400 --> 28:29.240
Can I tell you, I spent the eve of our wedding

28:29.320 --> 28:30.720
sitting on the bed,

28:30.800 --> 28:35.400
listening to what sounded like
an underwater symphony,

28:35.520 --> 28:38.640
of French horns and bassoons

28:38.720 --> 28:40.440
coming out of our hotel bathroom.

28:40.800 --> 28:44.480
Mix that with the smell of like
a dead cat and some fajitas

28:44.720 --> 28:46.720
and you've got what you call yourself

28:46.760 --> 28:49.720
a severely diminished libido.

28:49.840 --> 28:51.160
(THUDDING) Ow!

28:52.080 --> 28:53.600
Did you just kick me?

28:53.960 --> 28:55.920
No. Did you? You kicked her?

28:56.000 --> 28:57.040
Why'd you kick her?

28:57.440 --> 29:00.600
Yeah, I don't... I... Yes. I... I have leg spasms.

29:01.440 --> 29:02.800
Ow!

29:04.040 --> 29:05.120
It's a side effect.

29:05.200 --> 29:07.000
Terrible side effect from all the pill popping.

29:07.080 --> 29:09.080
But, you know, it's all better now.

29:09.160 --> 29:11.240
I'm clean and sober and I apologize.

29:11.280 --> 29:12.400
It's okay.

29:12.480 --> 29:15.640
Thirteenth step, right there. Back to drinking.

29:16.120 --> 29:18.040
Oh, Henderson, you thoughtless oaf,

29:18.120 --> 29:19.520
stop texting, open that door.

29:20.000 --> 29:21.960
Why do you keep calling me
Henderson? Just go with it.

29:22.320 --> 29:24.560
Palmer, so lovely to meet you.

29:24.960 --> 29:26.560
Likewise, really.

29:26.920 --> 29:28.440
I mean, look at you two.

29:28.800 --> 29:30.400
I mean, it's like, Barbie and...

29:30.480 --> 29:31.520
Yes.

29:32.760 --> 29:34.400
...Grandpa Ken.

29:34.480 --> 29:35.960
(LAUGHING)

29:36.040 --> 29:39.200
I mean... And even though it did not work out

29:39.240 --> 29:41.960
between us at all...

29:42.600 --> 29:44.440
It's like it never happened. You know?

29:44.480 --> 29:45.680
It really isn't.

29:45.800 --> 29:48.160
I still want my Danny to be happy. Oh, look at that.

29:48.280 --> 29:49.440
Happy, happy, happy.

29:49.520 --> 29:50.680
Good night, kiddo. Okay.

29:50.920 --> 29:52.160
Hello.

29:52.840 --> 29:54.600
It's her drug dealer I'm thinking.

29:54.960 --> 29:56.480
Okay, please put her on the phone right now.

29:57.280 --> 29:58.520
Are you kidding me, honey?

29:58.600 --> 30:00.240
You know how I feel about

30:00.320 --> 30:03.200
you selling your brother's stuff on eBay.

30:03.680 --> 30:05.320
Hey, hey, hey. Take that in the car.

30:05.400 --> 30:06.520
No. It's okay.

30:06.600 --> 30:11.360
I will deal with you when I get
home, young lady. Okay.

30:11.680 --> 30:13.800
I mean, you would think...

30:16.800 --> 30:18.280
You have kids?

30:18.880 --> 30:20.600
Hmm? Hmm?

30:21.040 --> 30:22.640
You have... You have children?

30:23.480 --> 30:26.080
We have sort of a little bit...

30:26.120 --> 30:28.160
A little bit of children, right?

30:28.240 --> 30:29.760
When were you planning on telling me

30:29.840 --> 30:30.960
about these children, Danny?

30:31.040 --> 30:32.320
I don't know, but listen,

30:32.360 --> 30:35.640
I have to go get to those little munchkins.

30:35.760 --> 30:37.720
Palmer, so nice, seriously.

30:37.800 --> 30:38.840
Danny.

30:40.680 --> 30:42.480
No, no, no, hey, hey.

30:42.760 --> 30:44.040
Okay.

30:47.000 --> 30:49.040
Are you freaked out right now about all this or...

30:49.840 --> 30:52.480
Actually, just the opposite.

30:52.880 --> 30:55.480
The opposite of freaked out?
What do you mean? Good?

30:55.560 --> 30:56.880
You know that I love kids.

30:56.960 --> 30:58.040
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

30:58.120 --> 31:00.080
I just never pegged you as a kids guy.

31:00.440 --> 31:02.920
I'm a huge kids guy. I love kids.

31:03.000 --> 31:04.680
Kids, kids, kids. Is...

31:04.760 --> 31:06.920
Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's my thing.
That's my bumper sticker.

31:07.000 --> 31:08.200
What are their names?

31:08.920 --> 31:12.360
What are their names again? There is

31:12.880 --> 31:17.200
the girl who, of course, is Kiki Dee.

31:17.440 --> 31:20.840
And then the boy's name's Bart.

31:21.120 --> 31:24.360
Which of course is short for Barto.

31:24.520 --> 31:25.840
Well, I wanna meet them!

31:26.600 --> 31:27.680
Of course you do.

31:28.480 --> 31:30.080
MAGGIE: So our mom doesn't
know that you took us today?

31:30.200 --> 31:31.400
Not yet.

31:31.480 --> 31:33.080
You know this is kidnapping.

31:33.200 --> 31:34.360
Stranger danger.

31:34.440 --> 31:35.720
What? No.

31:35.800 --> 31:38.440
Is the guy from Dateline NBC gonna walk in?

31:38.560 --> 31:42.920
No! I know you two a long time and Rosa's here.

31:43.000 --> 31:45.200
(SINGING)

31:45.280 --> 31:47.160
Doing whatever that Rosa does.

31:47.880 --> 31:49.480
God, she's freaky. DANNY: Yeah.

31:49.600 --> 31:50.600
So here's the deal.

31:51.040 --> 31:54.600
How would you like to be my pretend children

31:54.640 --> 31:56.000
for one afternoon?

31:56.960 --> 31:59.080
Why don't you just tell that poor girl the truth?

31:59.160 --> 32:00.240
You know?

32:00.320 --> 32:01.960
Our mother tells us everything.

32:02.040 --> 32:03.400
Wedding ring boy.

32:03.480 --> 32:04.640
What? Oh, my goodness!

32:04.720 --> 32:07.640
Did you see Gossip Girl last night? It was so good!

32:07.720 --> 32:09.600
No, she's not like that.

32:09.680 --> 32:11.920
Your mother's presenting her in a weird, weird way.

32:11.960 --> 32:13.080
I'm just saying, telling the truth

32:13.160 --> 32:14.640
is not in the cards right now.

32:14.760 --> 32:17.160
I thought you'd be excited to have an acting job.

32:17.280 --> 32:19.480
If it's an acting job, we should get paid.

32:19.600 --> 32:22.000
Yeah, you're gonna get paid in experience.

32:22.120 --> 32:23.960
I wanna actually get paid.

32:24.040 --> 32:25.000
(CHUCKLES)

32:25.120 --> 32:26.400
All right, what do you want?

32:26.600 --> 32:28.440
$600 for the day,

32:28.520 --> 32:30.920
plus overtime if we go over eight hours.

32:31.000 --> 32:32.520
I'll do my own hair and makeup.

32:32.640 --> 32:35.640
And I want you to pay for the six-week
intensive acting camp

32:35.680 --> 32:37.040
that my mom can't afford.

32:37.800 --> 32:42.040
$50 for the day and a two-week acting
class at the YMCA nearest you.

32:42.480 --> 32:44.640
$500 and a four- week acting class.

32:44.840 --> 32:47.160
$300 and a three-week class.

32:47.480 --> 32:48.520
Done.

32:49.960 --> 32:51.920
I would have done it for $500.

32:52.080 --> 32:54.040
(SCOFFS) I would have done it for the experience.

32:56.800 --> 32:59.120
Michael, you're up. Opener?

32:59.280 --> 33:01.000
I want you to take me to Hawaii

33:01.040 --> 33:03.040
so I can swim with the dolphins.

33:03.200 --> 33:04.880
You're not gonna let that one go, are you?

33:05.120 --> 33:07.120
We're not going to Hawaii, pal. Anything else?

33:07.200 --> 33:09.240
Find someone else then.

33:15.360 --> 33:19.240
Ooh, the Mafia stare down. Very good, Michael.

33:19.360 --> 33:20.680
We're here to negotiate.

33:20.760 --> 33:22.560
Do you have anything else you might like?

33:23.240 --> 33:24.600
I want a flying pony.

33:24.680 --> 33:27.160
I want a flying pony too, Michael, but they don't exist.

33:27.880 --> 33:30.920
Then I want a regular pony. And
I want to name him Nelson.

33:31.280 --> 33:34.040
How about a Playstation 3 and we name him Nelson?

33:34.880 --> 33:35.920
Keep talking.

33:36.200 --> 33:38.040
We'll include four video games.

33:38.120 --> 33:39.200
Five games.

33:39.280 --> 33:42.920
And I want the meeting with blondie
to be at J.D. McFunnigan's.

33:43.080 --> 33:44.200
How 'bout Charlie Choo-Choo's

33:44.280 --> 33:45.440
'cause it's right down the street from me.

33:45.880 --> 33:48.360
Mention that slop-hole again and I walk.

33:48.440 --> 33:50.880
All right, take it easy, son. Take it easy.

33:51.160 --> 33:53.160
And I want unlimited tokens.

33:53.240 --> 33:55.720
If I can spend 'em, I wanna have 'em.

33:55.800 --> 33:57.520
I don't wanna be like playing Skee-Ball

33:57.600 --> 33:59.280
and all of a sudden run out of tokens.

33:59.960 --> 34:02.000
All right, I can make that happen.

34:02.080 --> 34:03.600
So do we have a deal?

34:05.160 --> 34:06.360
(IMITATES SMOKING)

34:06.760 --> 34:07.840
Deal.

34:08.080 --> 34:10.480
Deal's off unless you eat that pizza, though. Seriously.

34:13.840 --> 34:15.320
Can I do an accent?

34:15.400 --> 34:16.960
Let me hear some. 'Ello!

34:17.080 --> 34:18.560
No. Okay.

34:18.960 --> 34:21.600
My kids? Have you completely lost your mind?

34:21.679 --> 34:23.400
Are you kidding me right now?

34:23.480 --> 34:25.159
You're the one who picked up your cell phone.

34:25.600 --> 34:26.639
That is not...

34:26.760 --> 34:27.960
Mrs. Harrington...

34:29.440 --> 34:31.080
The doctor will see you now.

34:32.480 --> 34:35.000
I can't believe you're doing all of
this just so you can get some.

34:35.080 --> 34:36.840
It's just gross. You're just pathetic.

34:36.920 --> 34:39.280
I'm not trying to get some. I already got some.

34:39.360 --> 34:41.199
And yes, I'd like to continue getting some.

34:41.280 --> 34:42.800
I'm pro me getting some.

34:42.880 --> 34:44.080
Have a seat right there, Mrs. Harrington.

34:44.159 --> 34:45.880
Remove your shirt, if you could.

34:46.679 --> 34:50.520
I smell something. You smell something?

34:50.560 --> 34:51.920
I smell perfume.

34:54.719 --> 34:55.960
Is that coming from you?

34:56.360 --> 34:57.560
(STUTTERING)

34:57.960 --> 34:59.120
Maybe.

34:59.640 --> 35:00.960
What, you got a date or something?

35:01.200 --> 35:03.800
I don't have a date. I have a lunch.

35:04.120 --> 35:06.120
You got a lunch? Who you got a lunch with?

35:06.800 --> 35:09.520
Dr. Gervitz's office manager,
if you must know everything.

35:09.640 --> 35:10.640
His name is Brian.

35:10.800 --> 35:12.520
The guy with the gray soul patch?

35:12.680 --> 35:13.960
You know what?

35:14.040 --> 35:15.480
Hey, man, I'm Brian.

35:15.520 --> 35:16.560
You're mean!

35:16.640 --> 35:17.880
Wow, you wanna go to lunch sometime?

35:17.960 --> 35:20.040
Is he gonna take you there right after the big protest?

35:20.120 --> 35:22.520
Hey, man, we gotta stop these squirrels.

35:22.560 --> 35:23.640
(LAUGHING)

35:24.880 --> 35:26.360
He plays bass, don't he?

35:28.960 --> 35:30.360
You can take the brassiere off, too.

35:30.800 --> 35:32.800
And by the way, he does play the bass.

35:32.840 --> 35:34.680
And he writes songs.

35:34.840 --> 35:35.960
What does he write songs about,

35:36.040 --> 35:37.320
how bad his ponytail stinks?

35:37.480 --> 35:40.160
Mrs. Harrington, could you put your
hands on your hips, please?

35:40.320 --> 35:43.160
Okay, so, one of the funbags
is not having too much fun.

35:43.320 --> 35:44.680
All right, what happened anyways?

35:44.760 --> 35:47.560
Well, I hit it with the car door yesterday... Right.

35:47.680 --> 35:48.720
...and I heard a pop

35:48.800 --> 35:51.880
and then some sloshing sound when I walk.

35:52.080 --> 35:54.360
(CELL PHONE BUZZING) Yeah. I think.

35:58.160 --> 35:59.240
What are you doing?

35:59.560 --> 36:02.200
Could be the kids or could be Brian.

36:02.280 --> 36:03.520
Okay. Stop that.

36:03.600 --> 36:04.680
Do you mind just for one second?

36:04.760 --> 36:05.840
Let me just talk to this guy.

36:06.200 --> 36:07.400
(EXCLAIMS) Stop!

36:08.680 --> 36:09.920
Yeah.

36:10.360 --> 36:12.240
Hello? Yeah, man!

36:12.920 --> 36:14.240
Brian? You can lie down.

36:14.360 --> 36:16.920
Yeah, hi! We sure are.

36:17.360 --> 36:19.680
Yeah, no, sushi would be groovy.

36:19.760 --> 36:21.400
Okay, I'll see you at 1 :00 in the lobby.

36:21.480 --> 36:22.920
Okay, bye.

36:27.200 --> 36:28.520
What voice was that?

36:28.920 --> 36:29.960
That was my voice.

36:30.200 --> 36:31.400
Really?

36:31.520 --> 36:32.800
(SPEAKING IN HIGH-PITCHED VOICE)

36:32.880 --> 36:34.520
I didn't sound like that.

36:34.560 --> 36:35.760
(MIMICKING) One o'clock...

36:36.120 --> 36:38.040
You're excited about this guy, huh?

36:38.400 --> 36:40.960
Mrs. Harrington, this is numbing
cream for your nipples, okay?

36:41.080 --> 36:42.240
Oh. Oh, okay.

36:42.640 --> 36:43.960
It's gonna be one afternoon.

36:44.040 --> 36:45.440
Why are we making such a big deal out of this?

36:45.560 --> 36:47.720
Because you know what? You're
trying to get my kids involved

36:47.800 --> 36:52.120
in your dysfunctional, sick little,
pathetic, twisted web of lies.

36:52.240 --> 36:53.920
When I was negotiating with your son, Michael,

36:54.000 --> 36:56.920
he had the biggest smile I've
ever seen on anyone's face.

36:57.440 --> 36:59.720
When I told him we could do it at J.D. McFunnigan's,

36:59.800 --> 37:01.160
the kid looked like he won the Heisman Trophy,

37:01.240 --> 37:02.720
I'm not kidding you.

37:02.920 --> 37:04.360
I think that's enough. Do you feel that?

37:04.440 --> 37:05.480
No.

37:05.560 --> 37:06.600
No, but do you feel that?

37:07.080 --> 37:08.760
No. We're good.

37:08.920 --> 37:10.960
By the way, did you make this?

37:11.040 --> 37:12.160
Mmm-hmm.

37:12.240 --> 37:14.000
We'll have to give it to the Smithsonian

37:14.080 --> 37:16.160
when we've done the operation. Terrific job.

37:16.760 --> 37:18.000
Did he really smile?

37:18.200 --> 37:20.000
Swear to God, like the cutest little smile.

37:20.800 --> 37:22.440
And I got Maggie to eat.

37:23.160 --> 37:24.320
You did? Yeah.

37:24.680 --> 37:26.440
Pizza. Deep dish. Three pieces.

37:26.680 --> 37:28.080
I can't get her to eat anything.

37:28.160 --> 37:31.040
I know you can't. Don't do this for me.

37:32.320 --> 37:33.680
Do it for the children.

37:35.680 --> 37:37.200
Yeah! Oh, stop!

Come on, you're late!

sale? Why are you wearing that?

37:52.440 --> 37:53.560
Are you kidding me?

37:53.640 --> 37:54.960
This is what you bought for me.

37:55.040 --> 37:56.600
I know, I know. I'm just saying is it...

37:56.680 --> 37:57.800
All right, we're stuck with it,

37:57.880 --> 37:59.040

No negating.

Gotcha. That sounds good, that's smart.

says "No" in a scene,

38:12.800 --> 38:14.200
the whole class yells, "Die!"

38:14.400 --> 38:16.200
No. I mean, no one will say "no" then.

38:16.280 --> 38:17.360
Don't yell "die."

39:17.360 --> 39:18.800
Stinks.

39:19.200 --> 39:23.840
Smells like kids' feet and like skidmark underwear.

39:23.920 --> 39:25.800
Mmm. Happy Father's Day.

39:27.360 --> 39:29.560
DANNY: Oh! Jeez!

39:29.840 --> 39:31.080
(SCREAMING)

39:31.160 --> 39:34.960
Mommy! That man put his pee-pee on my face!

39:35.120 --> 39:36.240
What?

39:37.240 --> 39:40.560
He put his face on my pee-pee. Danny!

39:40.720 --> 39:42.840
I'm saying he's the one. I don't think it matters.

39:43.000 --> 39:44.040
No, I get you.

39:44.240 --> 39:45.960
Oh, oh! Palmer, darling.

39:46.160 --> 39:47.240
Hi.

39:47.680 --> 39:50.480
Devlin. Thank you so much for bringing the kids today.

39:50.560 --> 39:52.440
I don't think she was the only one who brought them.

39:52.520 --> 39:56.000
You know what I'm saying? They are my pride and joy.

39:56.120 --> 40:00.160
So I'd like to introduce you to, the one and only,

40:00.240 --> 40:04.120
Kiki Dee, who came out at nine pounds four ounces.

40:04.200 --> 40:05.240
Yeouch.

40:05.440 --> 40:07.360
And then the whopper, we call him, Bart,

40:07.440 --> 40:10.360
because he was a 1 2-pounder and did some damage.

40:10.480 --> 40:12.000
Okay. So...

40:12.920 --> 40:14.160
Hi, you guys.

40:14.320 --> 40:15.480
(IN ENGLISH ACCENT) Hello, Palmer.

40:15.560 --> 40:17.080
Heard so much about you.

40:19.040 --> 40:20.160
You're British?

40:20.360 --> 40:23.960
So you're the bird what's been given
Daddy the ol' slap and tickle?

40:25.880 --> 40:30.000
We sent her to boarding school last year in England.

40:30.560 --> 40:32.880
See? So she picked up a slight accent.

40:32.960 --> 40:34.960
It's, you know, very Madonna.

40:35.360 --> 40:37.600
Well, it is a pleasure meeting you, Kiki Dee.

40:38.120 --> 40:39.680
Wish I could say the same.

40:39.880 --> 40:43.240
You see, before you, I had meself a father.

40:43.520 --> 40:45.240
I was the apple of his eye.

40:45.320 --> 40:47.840
It was all giggling and chasing butterflies

40:47.920 --> 40:49.720
in the meadows, and what have you.

40:50.320 --> 40:51.560
And now what do I got?

40:51.680 --> 40:53.520
An hour and a half every other week

40:53.600 --> 40:58.080
at J.D. McFunnigan's with him and his whore.

40:58.800 --> 41:00.320
Koko! Kiki! Kiki!

41:00.720 --> 41:02.040
(CRYING)

41:03.200 --> 41:05.040
God, she's in such pain.

41:05.160 --> 41:06.880
No, that's the pills that...

41:06.960 --> 41:08.160
She took some out of her mother's bureau.

41:08.200 --> 41:09.320
Are you...

41:09.480 --> 41:10.960
All right, let me go see her.

41:13.040 --> 41:14.680
How are you doing, sweetie?

41:14.760 --> 41:18.040
I'll be better when I start seeing some tokens.

41:19.320 --> 41:20.680
He's American.

41:22.280 --> 41:25.080
Excuse me. Yo! What was that all about?

41:25.280 --> 41:28.200
That was raw and real and in the moment.

41:28.280 --> 41:29.600
You know, I feel very good about it.

41:29.720 --> 41:31.320
You do? Well, I don't!

41:31.400 --> 41:34.120
So if you wanna get your money
and your acting classes,

41:34.200 --> 41:37.000
you better start doing things right from now on.

41:37.080 --> 41:38.560
No more sob stories.

41:38.600 --> 41:40.840
And we're stuck with the English accent now, Ringo,

41:40.920 --> 41:42.880
so commit to it. Don't choke, got it?

41:42.960 --> 41:44.040
Got it.

41:44.120 --> 41:46.120
Now hug me and laugh

41:46.200 --> 41:48.040
and let's get back into the show.

41:48.120 --> 41:50.760
Okay. Papa!

41:53.280 --> 41:55.560
You're not a whore, Palmer.

41:55.640 --> 41:56.720
Okay.

41:56.800 --> 41:58.560
That's so nice. See what they do, they fight,

41:58.640 --> 41:59.880
then they make up and it's good.

42:00.040 --> 42:01.320
Good. We're doing good.

42:01.400 --> 42:04.120
(SNEEZES) Are you kidding me?

42:04.560 --> 42:08.400
Got a hamburger here for Bart, Art the Water Fart.

42:08.480 --> 42:09.520
Here you go, kid.

42:09.560 --> 42:10.800
Look at that, sweet!

42:10.920 --> 42:15.280
And two quesadillas for Kiki Sneaky
With a Side of Freaky.

42:16.560 --> 42:18.600
Here's the waters. No soda for you.

42:18.680 --> 42:21.240
You're battling diabetes, remember? Huh?

42:22.240 --> 42:23.640
Kiki Dee?

42:23.800 --> 42:27.600
I got you two quesadillas 'cause it's your
favorite food so you have to eat it.

42:28.720 --> 42:33.320
Well, yes! And that's why I'm going
to eat every single bit of it.

42:33.680 --> 42:35.240
All right, let's see.

42:38.000 --> 42:39.120
Yummy!

42:39.280 --> 42:40.320
(MOUTHING) Thank you.

42:40.560 --> 42:42.320
Hey, I think we forgot napkins.

42:42.600 --> 42:44.480
We did? Okay. Well let me get the napkins.

42:44.600 --> 42:46.160
Because I know she's not gonna get up and do it

42:46.240 --> 42:47.760
because she doesn't like to get up and do anything.

42:47.920 --> 42:49.000
Oh, nice.

42:49.200 --> 42:50.640
Everybody be cool.

42:52.040 --> 42:56.360
So, Bart, your dad tells me you
like to go to the bathroom.

42:57.000 --> 42:59.360
When I feel it, I do it.

43:00.280 --> 43:01.840
What else do you like?

43:02.080 --> 43:03.440
I don't know.

43:05.000 --> 43:06.120
That's our Bart.

43:06.200 --> 43:08.160
He's a man of very few words.

43:08.800 --> 43:10.240
Ah. Okay.

43:10.840 --> 43:12.320
Maybe I'm upset.

43:13.360 --> 43:15.000
Upset about me and your father dating?

43:15.200 --> 43:19.760
No. You seem to make my dad
happy and that's cool, but...

43:20.600 --> 43:21.720
But what?

43:22.960 --> 43:24.120
Nothing.

43:24.280 --> 43:25.280
Hey, I want you to feel comfortable

43:25.360 --> 43:26.520
telling me anything.

43:27.400 --> 43:29.960
Well, I just hate that he broke his promise to me.

43:30.120 --> 43:31.200
What promise?

43:31.280 --> 43:32.560
Yeah, what promise?

43:32.720 --> 43:35.560
He promised me last year that
he would take me to Hawaii

43:35.680 --> 43:36.680
to swim with the dolphins.

43:37.080 --> 43:39.200
They have this lagoon there with dolphins

43:39.280 --> 43:40.680
and people get to swim with them.

43:40.800 --> 43:41.840
What are you doing?

43:41.920 --> 43:44.640
But without warning, my dad canceled the trip.

43:44.960 --> 43:46.360
Why would he do that?

43:46.720 --> 43:48.480
(FAKES CRYING) He met you.

43:49.800 --> 43:50.960
He what?

43:51.160 --> 43:52.960
No! Die!

43:53.160 --> 43:56.160
No, no, no, no, no, no! I'm saying that did not...

43:56.600 --> 43:58.560
You misread what I said.

43:58.640 --> 44:01.520
I said we have to go to Hawaii earlier.

44:01.840 --> 44:04.840
Because I'm excited for all of us to hang out there.

44:04.920 --> 44:06.000
We're going to Hawaii!

44:15.680 --> 44:18.840
I can't believe I let a six-year-old blackmail me.

44:19.360 --> 44:21.280
I saw my shot and I took it.

44:21.600 --> 44:22.600
You're angry at yourself

44:22.680 --> 44:24.240
'cause you got us into this whole situation.

44:24.360 --> 44:25.560
I did? You really did.

44:25.680 --> 44:27.400
I think old Mary Poppins with the,

44:27.520 --> 44:30.080
"You can't say no. You can't say no, Guv'nor."

44:30.240 --> 44:32.000
Okay, listen, my tolerance

44:32.080 --> 44:34.280
for these continued shenanigans is right here.

44:34.440 --> 44:36.760
And if it gets up to here, I'm taking my kids,

44:36.840 --> 44:38.680
I'm selling you out and I'm going home.

44:39.040 --> 44:42.440
I am so happy we are doing this, Danny.

44:42.520 --> 44:44.120
Are you kidding me? We're going to Hawaii,

44:44.200 --> 44:45.760
we're gonna swim with dolphins.

44:45.880 --> 44:47.520
It's gonna be so much fun. I was just telling the squirt.

44:47.600 --> 44:49.080
And Seventeen magazine.

44:49.200 --> 44:50.920
You brought that for these guys or is that for you?

44:50.960 --> 44:52.520
It's mine. It's my favorite.

44:52.600 --> 44:54.440
See that? Did you ever read that magazine?

44:54.520 --> 44:55.720
Thirty years ago you did.

44:56.400 --> 44:59.440
And hopefully we're gonna have
time together, right, sweetie?

44:59.560 --> 45:01.400
EDDIE: Wait! Wait!

45:01.600 --> 45:03.200
(EXCLAIMING IN GERMAN)

45:03.280 --> 45:04.960
Danny, wait!

45:09.400 --> 45:13.120
Muffinstein, I could not stand to be without you.

45:13.200 --> 45:14.400
(MUFFLED GROAN) Uh-oh!

45:14.480 --> 45:15.520
Is this him?

45:15.600 --> 45:18.160
I see the Colonel von Generous
right here in front of me.

45:18.240 --> 45:19.840
Okay, I'm confused right now.

45:20.120 --> 45:22.120
I'm so sorry. I've not introduced myself,

45:22.160 --> 45:25.640
we have talked on the phone,
but I am the Dolph Lundgren.

45:27.080 --> 45:29.160
Devlin's man-friendl love monkey.

45:29.320 --> 45:30.400
Oh, kill me now.

45:30.480 --> 45:32.400
Devlin said you had to stay back and work.

45:32.600 --> 45:34.000
I did. She what said?

45:34.200 --> 45:36.520
Nein, nein to the work.

45:36.600 --> 45:38.320
I will work when I am kaput.

45:38.520 --> 45:40.000
You know, I think this is so great

45:40.080 --> 45:41.600
of all of you, so mature.

45:41.640 --> 45:43.680
I would have loved if my parents
had done something like this

45:43.760 --> 45:45.160
when they got divorced.

45:45.280 --> 45:47.480
That's why I was thinking we
should have the man come.

45:47.560 --> 45:49.200
Yeah, I'm glad. I'm glad.

45:49.360 --> 45:51.200
It's important for the children

45:51.280 --> 45:53.360
to see us as a unit.

45:53.480 --> 45:55.400
And also I cannot stay away from this potato pancake.

45:55.520 --> 45:58.160
She loves the schnitzel, you know what I mean?

46:00.440 --> 46:01.800
(GROANS)

46:01.880 --> 46:03.760
You know what? Tongue feels a little dry.

46:03.840 --> 46:06.200
Let's go get you some water, honey. We'll be back.

46:06.320 --> 46:07.800
That's a big tongue, big tongue.

46:07.880 --> 46:10.240
Get over here, get over here. Ew!

46:10.320 --> 46:11.360
What are you doing here?

46:11.440 --> 46:13.600
I don't know, saving the day. Helping. Hello?

46:13.680 --> 46:15.520
Who are you talking to? What are you looking at?

46:16.200 --> 46:17.440
I can't see in these things.

46:17.520 --> 46:18.600
This is what you're gonna do.

46:18.680 --> 46:21.440
You're gonna tell them that you ate a
bad sauerkraut omelet for breakfast

46:21.520 --> 46:23.840
and that you are feeling like you're
sick and that you gotta go.

46:23.920 --> 46:25.600
Katherine, I can't go. Okay? Why?

46:25.720 --> 46:29.320
Because I texted a picture of my new
equipment to my ex-girlfriend.

46:29.400 --> 46:30.440
Oh, you're disgusting.

46:30.560 --> 46:32.320
And I forgot she's engaged to a UFC fighter.

46:32.400 --> 46:34.240
He wants to punch me in the face.

46:34.400 --> 46:35.920
I wanna punch you in the face.

I am just waiting for the money for the ticket.

46:41.960 --> 46:44.280
Mmm-hmm. So you are coming? And I am paying?

46:44.440 --> 46:46.680
Yes. Dolph has zero dollars.

46:46.760 --> 46:47.800
Whoops! Okay.

Let me see if I can find my credit card.

46:50.560 --> 46:51.600
Oh, here it is.

47:11.960 --> 47:13.680
Didn't have time to make any reservations,

47:13.760 --> 47:15.040
but I need two rooms, please.

47:15.120 --> 47:16.280
Oh, of course.

47:16.360 --> 47:18.240
Unfortunately, we only have our suites left.

47:18.440 --> 47:19.560
Oh, boy.

47:19.640 --> 47:22.200
The Waldorf Astoria at $8,000 per night

47:22.240 --> 47:24.160
and the Presidential at $12,000.

47:24.280 --> 47:25.840
$12,000 a night? Mmm-hmm.

47:25.920 --> 47:27.800
Do the Rolling Stones come and
play for me while I'm in there?

47:27.880 --> 47:29.680
What the hell are you talking
about? Why is it so much?

47:29.760 --> 47:30.840
Is it made out of panda?

47:30.920 --> 47:32.280
I've used that somewhere else, but is it?

47:32.840 --> 47:35.160
No, but you've made some terrific suggestions

47:35.280 --> 47:36.560
and I'm gonna jot them down.

47:36.640 --> 47:38.920

Honors Rewards program?

No, I'm not.

Oh. That's too bad. You should join.

Yeah.

Yay!

Just got reamed. I mean, I got the rooms.

Me!

her whole thing right there,

Oh, come on. Like she's intimidated.

Yes, right?

48:37.920 --> 48:39.480
You can look that good

48:39.680 --> 48:41.880
if you don't take the elevators

48:41.920 --> 48:44.920
and only take the stairs like Cary Grant.

48:52.520 --> 48:53.600
Uh, what's the matter?

48:53.680 --> 48:55.040
I can't look at engagement rings?

48:55.200 --> 48:57.040
Engagement rings? Yeah, you heard me.

48:57.240 --> 48:59.760
Look all you want, but you and I both know that

48:59.920 --> 49:01.000
you're gonna get sick of this hottie

49:01.040 --> 49:02.840
and you're gonna be back on the prowl next week.

49:02.880 --> 49:04.760
Nope. I'm telling you, is this girl not cute?

49:04.920 --> 49:06.040
Yeah, she's really cute.

49:06.080 --> 49:07.200
Is she not the sweetest?

49:07.280 --> 49:08.360
The nicest person I've ever met.

49:08.520 --> 49:09.920
Did you ever see her lips?

49:10.080 --> 49:11.440
I think she has the best lips I've ever seen.

49:11.520 --> 49:13.760
They're like an inner tube and I just wanna sit on it.

49:13.920 --> 49:15.240
You know what I mean? And just, like...

49:15.600 --> 49:17.080
Do you want me to knock you out, or...

49:17.600 --> 49:20.080
No, I'm saying you should sit on her lips.

49:20.280 --> 49:21.400
Anyways...

49:21.560 --> 49:24.200
You know, this whole situation reminds me of a song.

49:24.400 --> 49:27.120
Danny is a big plastic surgeon

49:27.280 --> 49:29.760
Who never had time for a wife

49:30.040 --> 49:33.200
And he's friends with Davy Who's still in the Navy

49:33.400 --> 49:35.080
Piano Man? Why Piano Man?

49:35.240 --> 49:36.520
No, it's "Piano Dan."

49:36.600 --> 49:38.240
That's based on your life. It's a little Eddie remix.

49:38.480 --> 49:39.480
Uh-huh.

49:39.560 --> 49:43.800
Eddie used to have an afro And
pimples all over his face

49:44.080 --> 49:47.200
So he popped and he poked 'em
And Clearasil soaked 'em

49:47.280 --> 49:49.320
But ladies still greet him with mace

49:49.400 --> 49:50.560
(BLOWING RASPBERRY)

49:51.400 --> 49:52.800

49:58.240 --> 50:01.080
So, guys, we're here to get to know each other better.

50:01.160 --> 50:02.240
Yes. Yeah.

50:02.320 --> 50:03.800
Dolph, let's start with you.

50:03.960 --> 50:05.640
So, what line of work are you in?

50:05.840 --> 50:09.600
Well, Palmer, I am in sheep.

50:11.160 --> 50:12.760
I'm sorry. I don't know what you mean.

50:13.240 --> 50:16.400
I am a sheep shipper.

50:16.800 --> 50:17.920
Oh. Yes.

50:18.000 --> 50:20.160
You know, people, they don't buy the sheep

50:20.280 --> 50:21.800
from the local sheepherder anymore.

50:22.320 --> 50:23.840
Really? They don't?

50:24.000 --> 50:27.480
No, they don't. They go online!

50:27.800 --> 50:29.440
Yes! They go on the Interweb,

50:29.640 --> 50:33.920
to my website, gotprettysheep.com.

50:34.000 --> 50:35.560
And leave this, please. Thank you.

50:35.680 --> 50:37.840
Now, people go on. They see the pictures of the sheep,

50:37.960 --> 50:39.360
and they pick the ones they want.

50:39.440 --> 50:40.800
You know, it's like, "I want that one.

50:40.840 --> 50:43.080
"You know, it's very stylish. You
know, it's a stylish one."

50:43.160 --> 50:45.640
Goes, "Oh, no, I want the shy
one who doesn't want to baa."

50:45.800 --> 50:47.360
Or they buy the sassy one,

50:47.520 --> 50:50.920
who's like, "Hey, I see you, baa, baa."

50:51.040 --> 50:52.640
So, what do the people do with these sheep?

50:53.120 --> 50:55.800
Whatever they want! Sky is the limit.

50:55.960 --> 50:57.480
You know, some have them as pets.

50:57.560 --> 50:59.720
Some have them as security for the house.

50:59.880 --> 51:01.160
A lot of the people...

51:01.360 --> 51:03.280
The new thing is training them

51:03.360 --> 51:06.000
to fight each other in the Sheep Fight Club.

51:07.320 --> 51:09.200
Sheep Fight Clubs?

51:09.360 --> 51:11.200
Yes. All the sheeps, they get together.

51:11.280 --> 51:13.880
They baa, all you hear is, "Baa, baa, baa."

51:14.040 --> 51:15.480
And then you see hoof, kick, hoof, kick,

51:15.560 --> 51:17.320
hoof, kick, baa, baa, baa, baa, baa!

51:17.480 --> 51:18.640
And then he's out.

51:18.840 --> 51:22.240
And that is how we met. She bought a sheep from me.

51:22.840 --> 51:24.080
Really? Why?

51:24.240 --> 51:26.200
Children? Okay, tune out.

51:26.360 --> 51:30.240
Okay, 'cause some secrets are coming
out, all right? Some adult ones.

51:30.400 --> 51:33.160
She likes to shave the sheep

51:33.400 --> 51:37.560
for the pelt for the sex, sexuals, yes.

51:37.920 --> 51:39.840
She has got a real fetish

51:39.920 --> 51:41.240
for the wool and stuff, you know.

51:41.360 --> 51:43.320
We do this thing called "sheepstenein."

51:46.560 --> 51:47.880
Yeah. Absolutely.

51:47.960 --> 51:49.360

I'm sorry, we're leaving. I can't do it. No.

51:56.080 --> 51:57.360
I'm gonna kill that guy. He's lost it.

51:57.440 --> 51:58.920
He was going sheep-crazy, I'll give you that.

51:59.000 --> 52:00.240
Where is your hand right now?

52:00.320 --> 52:01.520
You wanna see where it is?

52:01.600 --> 52:03.040
It's not even here anymore! It's gone!

52:03.120 --> 52:04.160
How about I beat him up?

52:04.240 --> 52:05.920
You can beat him up with me. It'll be fun.

52:06.080 --> 52:07.720
I don't want to! I have to go.

52:07.840 --> 52:09.880
Don't bail on me right now! Don't
make that face at me.

It's my favorite college Devlin!

52:27.080 --> 52:30.240
Both of us here at this resort at the same time.

52:30.960 --> 52:33.080
I didn't know you came to places like this.

52:33.120 --> 52:34.200
Here we go.

52:34.280 --> 52:35.280
Honey!

This is one of my best friends from my sorority.

Katherine, this is my husband, lan Maxtone Jones.

52:44.200 --> 52:45.240
Pleasure.

52:45.320 --> 52:48.160
You might've heard of him. He invented the iPod.

52:48.440 --> 52:51.440
Well, of course he did. The iPod.

52:51.640 --> 52:53.800
The idea just came to me in the shower.

got yourselves here, huh?

You are just the same glorious Devlin that I remember.

53:26.680 --> 53:29.520
Oh, my God, I ran into Sandra Wernick last month.

53:30.360 --> 53:33.480
The poor thing. She's already
divorced and she has a child.

53:33.840 --> 53:36.360
She's a single mother. It's a disaster.

53:36.480 --> 53:38.040
I feel so bad for her.

53:38.320 --> 53:39.840
Are you married?

53:40.200 --> 53:41.760
Mmm-hmm. Yes.

53:52.920 --> 53:54.040
will you just go with it, honey?

53:54.200 --> 53:55.600

Invented it. Pleasure. I heard.

Devlin, I think I spoke about you with my wife

54:06.080 --> 54:07.840
in the bathroom one or two times, right?

54:07.880 --> 54:09.040
We did.

54:09.120 --> 54:10.480
Number two.

54:10.560 --> 54:12.200
We did it twice, yes.

54:12.320 --> 54:14.960
So, chief, tell me, what do you do for a living?

54:15.040 --> 54:17.080
I'm also an inventor, just like you.

leave me hanging so long?

You're so clever. That's so silly.

57:38.280 --> 57:39.560
(SCREAMS)

57:39.640 --> 57:40.720
(LAUGHING)

57:40.800 --> 57:44.000
Holy Devlin! Ow!

57:44.840 --> 57:46.000
EDDIE: Come on, let's go.

57:46.160 --> 57:48.880
Piggyback times are magical times, aren't they?

57:48.960 --> 57:50.960
Yeah, aren't they? You're warping my spine now.

57:51.080 --> 57:52.440
(EXCLAIMS)

57:53.480 --> 57:55.240
I think Kiki slipped.

57:57.080 --> 58:00.400
Oh, Father, I just love spending time with you!

58:02.640 --> 58:04.600
Oh, my God!

58:05.920 --> 58:07.400
You guys, look at this!

58:07.560 --> 58:09.520
KATHERINE: Oh, my God! MAGGIE: It's lovely!

58:09.600 --> 58:11.960
KATHERINE: Wow! That is unbelievable.

58:12.280 --> 58:15.360
I don't know about you guys,
but I am gonna go cool off.

58:15.520 --> 58:17.200
Really? There could be black pigs in there.

58:17.600 --> 58:19.080
I agree.

58:19.240 --> 58:20.800
Look at that. That's terrific.

58:21.320 --> 58:24.480
Does the hotel know you took those
pillows, honey? (CHUCKLES)

58:25.680 --> 58:27.800
She really wears that bikini well.

58:28.040 --> 58:29.160
Yeah.

58:29.280 --> 58:32.520
You know what she'd wear well?
Dental floss and a pirate hat.

58:32.720 --> 58:34.320
Don't say that. Absolutely gross.

58:36.800 --> 58:38.120
EDDIE: Oh, my God! Gorgeous!

58:38.280 --> 58:39.320
KATHERINE: Perfect.

58:39.440 --> 58:42.480
That was a ten! A perfect ten! Yay!

58:43.120 --> 58:45.640
So, Al Jolson, you mind jumping in the water

58:45.720 --> 58:48.000
and also screaming on the way
down, "I love my daddy"?

58:48.120 --> 58:49.560
Okay.

58:50.280 --> 58:51.360
Yeah, do it, do it for me.

58:51.560 --> 58:53.000
Do it for Da-da. KATHERINE: I love my daddy.

58:53.040 --> 58:55.160
Daddy is my favorite adult!

58:56.280 --> 58:58.360
(WHOOPS) You're paying her enough for this, right?

58:58.520 --> 59:01.400
And I love you, my little British crumpet!

59:02.480 --> 59:04.200
All right, homeboy, you're up next. Let's go.

59:04.360 --> 59:05.960
Come up with something on your own.

59:07.960 --> 59:09.400
You gotta squeeze out another log?

59:09.560 --> 59:11.240
What happened? What'd he whisper to you?

59:11.800 --> 59:13.200
Water's too deep.

59:13.360 --> 59:14.760
Water's too deep for what?

59:14.920 --> 59:16.040
He can't swim.

59:16.520 --> 59:18.120
He can't swim?

59:18.480 --> 59:20.960
And you wanna swim with the dolphins?

59:21.040 --> 59:22.880
That makes a lot of sense.

59:23.680 --> 59:25.160
Hadn't thought it through.

59:25.360 --> 59:27.000
No kidding you didn't think it through.

59:27.200 --> 59:28.920
Thought about spending all my
money, though, didn't you?

59:29.040 --> 59:31.440
Danny! I'm saying, I'm not the kid's...

59:31.480 --> 59:33.880
Okay. No one taught you how to swim, huh?

59:34.240 --> 59:37.600
Well, my dad's supposed to, but he's busy.

59:37.880 --> 59:39.840
Uh-huh. Busy being an idiot.

59:51.200 --> 59:54.600
You guys have to come in, the water feels magical!

59:54.960 --> 59:58.360
I got something magical, too.
Right in the downstairs area.

59:58.520 --> 01:00:00.120
I don't high-five when it's...

01:00:00.280 --> 01:00:01.400
Downstairs area!

01:00:01.600 --> 01:00:03.200
No, put it away. Sorry. No, stop.

01:00:03.360 --> 01:00:06.200
You know what? I think Mommy's gonna
explore the magical waters.

01:00:06.280 --> 01:00:08.280
Honey, are you okay to hang
out here with fake Daddy?

01:00:08.880 --> 01:00:09.960
Sure.

01:00:10.080 --> 01:00:11.600
Really? You're gonna get undressed?

01:00:11.680 --> 01:00:12.680
What are you doing?

01:00:12.880 --> 01:00:14.440
What? You got a bathing cap, too?

01:00:14.560 --> 01:00:15.720
You're the worst.

01:00:15.800 --> 01:00:18.760
A 1920s swimming gown on, honey?

01:00:19.200 --> 01:00:21.040
Don't do it. Don't take it off.

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:37.120
Yeah. I have to be alone.

01:00:37.280 --> 01:00:38.440
Okay.

01:00:42.120 --> 01:00:44.280
God, I gotta start taking the stairs more.

01:00:44.400 --> 01:00:45.480
Don't buy that line.

01:00:45.600 --> 01:00:47.920
She takes spinning classes like they're M&M's.

01:00:54.800 --> 01:00:56.520
I think he's wearing my underwear.

01:00:58.920 --> 01:01:00.080
What is he doing?

01:01:00.520 --> 01:01:02.440
Yo, I guarantee you fall!

01:01:02.800 --> 01:01:03.960
I'm all set.

01:01:04.040 --> 01:01:05.280
(EXCLAIMING)

01:01:06.800 --> 01:01:07.760
Ow!

01:01:08.120 --> 01:01:09.520
Thank you, God.

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:14.640
I wanna climb Palmer Mountain,

01:01:14.680 --> 01:01:16.440
so what do you say we get rid of these kids?

01:01:16.480 --> 01:01:19.160
No. They had them last night. It's our turn.

01:01:19.280 --> 01:01:21.680
Isn't that how things work? We alternate?

01:01:21.760 --> 01:01:23.200
What? No.

01:01:23.320 --> 01:01:26.160
I get the kids... I had them today.

01:01:26.280 --> 01:01:27.560
That counted as a "me" day

01:01:27.640 --> 01:01:28.760
and then she gets them at night.

01:01:28.840 --> 01:01:30.040
That's how we do it. Oh.

01:01:30.480 --> 01:01:32.800
Dolph, Devlin, do you want us to watch the kids

01:01:32.880 --> 01:01:34.960
so that you guys can have a little alone time?

01:01:35.280 --> 01:01:37.200
I don't think... Yes! Absoshnutely!

01:01:37.280 --> 01:01:38.560
We are sleeping together!

01:01:38.640 --> 01:01:40.480
You guys have your own beds and it's our time!

01:01:40.560 --> 01:01:43.200
So we're gonna watch them. Good.

01:01:44.880 --> 01:01:46.640
You guys wanna come take a look at the balcony?

01:01:46.680 --> 01:01:47.840
I think I saw some dolphins around here.

01:01:47.960 --> 01:01:51.200
Dolphins? Hey, he loves those, right? Dolphins.

01:01:51.320 --> 01:01:52.400
Sorry. Okay, go.

01:01:52.480 --> 01:01:53.840
All right, let go. Come on.

01:01:53.920 --> 01:01:55.320
Get the dolphins. Bye, you guys.

01:01:55.360 --> 01:01:57.080
That's why we're here, the dolphins.

01:01:57.120 --> 01:01:58.240
See you out there.

01:01:58.400 --> 01:01:59.840
Listen, if anything happens

01:01:59.920 --> 01:02:01.480
and you need any... And I mean anything,

01:02:01.560 --> 01:02:02.720
you have to call me.

01:02:02.840 --> 01:02:04.320
I'm good at this, I swear to you.

01:02:04.400 --> 01:02:06.520
I used to baby-sit Eddie when we were children.

01:02:06.920 --> 01:02:08.960
Eddie is your fault? No, no, no.

01:02:09.040 --> 01:02:10.840
But I want you to enjoy tonight.

01:02:10.920 --> 01:02:12.000
Come on, it's like a free night.

01:02:12.080 --> 01:02:13.520
You can do whatever you want.

01:02:13.600 --> 01:02:15.440
You can knit yourself some socks

01:02:15.480 --> 01:02:17.440
or shock people with your sneaky hot body.

01:02:17.520 --> 01:02:19.240
I don't know what you're talking about. Cary Grant?

01:02:19.400 --> 01:02:20.720
I'm just gonna sit in my room

01:02:20.840 --> 01:02:23.360
and worry about you and them and everything.

01:02:23.440 --> 01:02:25.280
What about just hang out platonically

01:02:25.360 --> 01:02:27.000
with Eddie tonight? Have some dinner?

01:02:27.080 --> 01:02:28.440
Or is he not good enough?

01:02:28.520 --> 01:02:31.520
You need Brian, the guy from Foghat, around here.

01:02:31.720 --> 01:02:32.920
That really bothered you

01:02:32.960 --> 01:02:34.880
that I went to lunch with that guy.

01:02:34.960 --> 01:02:36.520
What do you mean, you went to lunch with him?

01:02:36.560 --> 01:02:38.560
I told you I was going to lunch with him.

01:02:38.720 --> 01:02:40.440
I thought it was he asked you to lunch

01:02:40.520 --> 01:02:41.760
and you were gonna like scoff at it.

01:02:41.880 --> 01:02:44.200
But you did? You fell for his charms?

01:02:44.680 --> 01:02:47.040
I don't even understand what this is.

01:02:47.120 --> 01:02:48.440
It's the beard, man.

01:02:48.680 --> 01:02:49.840
It doesn't move!

01:02:50.040 --> 01:02:52.720
Well, yeah, in the wind, man. It's flapping around.

01:02:52.880 --> 01:02:54.360
All right. You know what? I'll tell you this.

01:02:54.440 --> 01:02:56.960
The guy made it through an entire lunch with a woman

01:02:57.080 --> 01:02:58.680
without making up a fake life.

01:02:59.120 --> 01:03:00.320
Ah.

01:03:00.880 --> 01:03:02.080
You just hurt me.

01:03:02.480 --> 01:03:05.240
That was not nice, but it was the truth.

01:03:05.320 --> 01:03:07.400
And I speak the truth.

01:03:07.480 --> 01:03:09.120
Please pay attention to my children.

01:03:09.240 --> 01:03:10.360
Everything will be nice.

01:03:10.480 --> 01:03:13.240
They serve room service in the hallway.

01:03:13.640 --> 01:03:15.760
I'm so nauseous. Okay. Bye.

01:03:19.320 --> 01:03:21.040
Alone at last!

01:03:21.160 --> 01:03:22.440
(WHIMPERING)

01:03:23.680 --> 01:03:24.880
(COUGHS)

01:03:25.920 --> 01:03:27.520
Let's play the game.

01:03:27.600 --> 01:03:29.640
We were doing so good with the game.

01:03:30.480 --> 01:03:34.320
"If you could be one person besides yourself,

01:03:34.600 --> 01:03:35.720
"who would you be?"

01:03:36.640 --> 01:03:38.520
Rachael Ray, because I've always

01:03:38.560 --> 01:03:39.600
wanted to know how to cook.

01:03:39.680 --> 01:03:41.440
Really? Oh, she's darling.

01:03:41.680 --> 01:03:44.200
You know what? I don't really wanna be anyone else.

01:03:44.280 --> 01:03:46.960
I'm happy with who I am. I choose me.

01:03:47.320 --> 01:03:49.320
Or Captain Kirk. Either one.

01:03:49.400 --> 01:03:51.200
See, that's a good one. All right.

01:03:51.360 --> 01:03:52.520
What about you, Bart?

01:03:53.840 --> 01:03:55.600
Mr. DeCesare.

01:03:55.960 --> 01:03:58.000
Our mailman? Why?

01:03:58.640 --> 01:04:02.040
He just seems like he's got it all figured out.

01:04:02.280 --> 01:04:03.840
We're getting deep.

01:04:04.440 --> 01:04:07.160
Okay, moving on. Uh...

01:04:07.640 --> 01:04:10.960
Okay. "Name something that makes you sad."

01:04:12.600 --> 01:04:16.800
That Judi Dench has never won
the Oscar for Best Actress.

01:04:17.840 --> 01:04:19.600
(CRYING) It's a travesty.

01:04:20.840 --> 01:04:22.960
That 'N Sync broke up.

01:04:24.040 --> 01:04:26.360
Yeah. That was rough on all of us.

01:04:26.880 --> 01:04:28.640
(SOFTLY) Who's 'N Sync?

01:04:29.560 --> 01:04:31.840
Sadness. Bart, you're up.

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:35.040
I don't wanna say mine.

01:04:35.200 --> 01:04:36.960
Okay. Let's move on then.

01:04:37.120 --> 01:04:38.200
Hey!

01:04:38.320 --> 01:04:40.480
Honey, come on. You can share anything with us.

01:04:40.640 --> 01:04:41.680
Yeah, share.

01:04:41.760 --> 01:04:43.480
He looks like he's about to lose it, but okay.

01:04:44.760 --> 01:04:47.840
When my dad doesn't have time for me.

01:04:48.840 --> 01:04:50.160
Come on, it's okay.

01:04:50.360 --> 01:04:53.400
We're okay. We're okay. It's fine.

01:04:53.480 --> 01:04:56.160
It's all gonna be okay. Come on.

01:04:56.200 --> 01:04:58.360
We don't need him in our lives.

01:04:58.840 --> 01:04:59.840
Wow.

01:04:59.920 --> 01:05:01.240
No, no, no, he's...

01:05:01.320 --> 01:05:02.560
MAGGIE: We're okay. It's fine.

01:05:02.720 --> 01:05:04.160
It's all gonna be okay.

01:05:04.720 --> 01:05:06.200
This has nothing to...

01:05:06.280 --> 01:05:08.600
This is, like, from a long time ago!

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:11.680
It's okay.

01:05:13.520 --> 01:05:14.520
What are you doing?

01:05:15.200 --> 01:05:17.280
DANNY: Well, that was a major setback.

01:05:17.880 --> 01:05:20.360
"When my dad doesn't have time
for me." (IMITATES CRYING)

01:05:21.080 --> 01:05:22.320
We're sorry.

01:05:22.400 --> 01:05:23.560
I know you're sorry.

01:05:23.640 --> 01:05:25.400
I know you got real stuff going on with your family.

01:05:25.560 --> 01:05:26.760
And it's painful.

01:05:26.840 --> 01:05:28.720
But you gotta just hold it in

01:05:28.800 --> 01:05:30.400
till you get to the mainland again.

01:05:30.520 --> 01:05:31.720
You're the ones who wanted to come here

01:05:31.800 --> 01:05:32.960
and go swimming with the dolphins

01:05:33.040 --> 01:05:35.200
or standing with the dolphins because you can't swim.

01:05:35.440 --> 01:05:37.400
Can you act professional? BOTH: Yes, sir.

01:05:37.440 --> 01:05:39.600
For at least two more days, until I kill you off

01:05:39.680 --> 01:05:41.760
in a boarding school train accident?

01:05:42.040 --> 01:05:43.600
I thought it was a car accident.

01:05:43.760 --> 01:05:44.760
I don't know. Either that

01:05:44.840 --> 01:05:46.200
or a science explosion, just something.

01:05:46.280 --> 01:05:48.520
You're gonna be dead soon. That's
the good news. Okay?

01:05:48.600 --> 01:05:50.800
So, can you just focus for a few more days?

01:05:50.920 --> 01:05:52.240
BOTH: Yes. Good.

01:05:52.400 --> 01:05:54.920
So, give me some fake hugs right
now and laugh real loud

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:56.280
like we're the happiest family on earth.

01:05:56.440 --> 01:05:57.920
Okay. Is that possible?

01:05:58.080 --> 01:06:00.480
And laughing, laughing, laughing.

01:06:00.640 --> 01:06:03.080
Okay, that's it. Laugh louder, louder.

01:06:03.160 --> 01:06:05.520
(LAUGHING LOUDLY)

01:06:05.600 --> 01:06:07.040
DANNY: I love you guys!

01:06:07.120 --> 01:06:09.600
Hey, sweetie! What's going on? What's up?

01:06:09.800 --> 01:06:12.800
So, kids, I just got off the phone with your mom

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:15.480
and you guys are gonna have plenty of time

01:06:15.560 --> 01:06:17.000
to spend with your dad tomorrow

01:06:17.080 --> 01:06:20.240
because she and I are gonna
have a nice, long spa day.

01:06:20.320 --> 01:06:21.400
ALL: Aw!

01:06:21.480 --> 01:06:24.480
Awesome! Awesome, awesome.

01:06:24.680 --> 01:06:26.520
You guys are so...

01:06:26.920 --> 01:06:29.560
I'll see you in a minute, okay? I love you.

01:06:31.720 --> 01:06:32.880
(KIDS EXCLAIMING)

01:06:32.960 --> 01:06:34.760
Okay, he's losing it. Okay, good night.

01:06:34.800 --> 01:06:35.920
He's losing it.

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:39.000
DANNY: All right, here we go. Everybody out.

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:42.480
So, what are we doing?

01:06:42.640 --> 01:06:45.000
Palmer forgot her camera in the room

01:06:45.120 --> 01:06:46.560
so I'm gonna have a surprise for her

01:06:46.640 --> 01:06:48.040
when she gets back from the spa.

01:06:48.120 --> 01:06:49.480
MAGGIE: A stolen camera?

01:06:49.520 --> 01:06:52.120
No, some pictures of us having a great time

01:06:52.280 --> 01:06:54.840
reassuring her of all the fun we have together.

01:06:56.120 --> 01:06:58.880
I forgot to flush the toilet before I left the hotel.

01:06:59.280 --> 01:07:00.720
So she's gonna have two surprises.

01:07:00.760 --> 01:07:04.000
Okay. No one's supposed to crap as much as you do.

01:07:04.120 --> 01:07:06.360
You gotta look into that Pepto Bismol or something.

01:07:06.520 --> 01:07:08.640
Here's your putters. Bing.

01:07:09.040 --> 01:07:10.560
And a bam. Thank you.

01:07:10.640 --> 01:07:13.640
Let's just look right in the camera.
And we're having fun.

01:07:13.840 --> 01:07:15.640
And we're a family. We love each other.

01:07:16.320 --> 01:07:17.520
And boo! (SHUTTER CLICKS)

01:07:17.880 --> 01:07:20.320
All right, let's do the old Michael-hit-a-putt shot. Okay?

01:07:20.400 --> 01:07:22.360
So boom, that's in the hole.

01:07:22.480 --> 01:07:23.640
And you're excited about that,

01:07:23.720 --> 01:07:26.760
and we're happy for him, and...
(EXCLAIMS) (SHUTTER CLICKS)

01:07:27.080 --> 01:07:29.200
Maggie just hit the ball, but you
followed through too much

01:07:29.320 --> 01:07:30.720
and it made you fall on your back.

01:07:30.800 --> 01:07:32.160
Okay, but... Look at this.

01:07:32.240 --> 01:07:34.480
You're laughing, but I'm a concerned
father, so I'm like,

01:07:34.560 --> 01:07:36.440
"Oh, my God." (SHUTTER CLICKS)

01:07:36.760 --> 01:07:38.360
All right, now,

01:07:38.480 --> 01:07:40.520
let's just laugh at something I
say, because I'm a funny dad.

01:07:40.600 --> 01:07:42.560
You're very close with me, and
you think I'm funny, and...

01:07:42.720 --> 01:07:43.960
Why are we always laughing?

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:45.360
Is there something wrong with us?

01:07:45.840 --> 01:07:48.360
No. You're just amused by everything
I say. So, here we go.

01:07:48.440 --> 01:07:50.920
Can we take a break? Do something really fun?

01:07:51.040 --> 01:07:52.720
No, we're not doing anything fun, man.

01:07:52.800 --> 01:07:54.400
We're here to fake having fun.

01:07:54.480 --> 01:07:55.640
Come on. Right to the camera.

01:07:55.720 --> 01:07:58.600
Don't worry. We never have
fun with our real dad either.

01:07:59.600 --> 01:08:01.200
Oh, man.

01:08:01.720 --> 01:08:03.920
(SIGHS) All right. How's this?

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:05.520
I'll teach you how to swim, okay?

01:08:05.600 --> 01:08:07.360
Before your mother gets back

01:08:07.440 --> 01:08:09.920
from the "spa day" in four hours?

01:08:10.080 --> 01:08:11.760
Is that even possible? Yeah.

01:08:11.880 --> 01:08:13.680
But we're gonna take one more
picture, if you don't mind.

01:08:13.880 --> 01:08:16.040
Make that two pictures. Maggie.

01:08:17.439 --> 01:08:18.840
Throw this straight in the air. Make it look like...

01:08:18.920 --> 01:08:20.600
On the count of three, one, two,
three. (SHUTTER CLICKS)

01:08:20.680 --> 01:08:21.760
Okay.

01:08:21.880 --> 01:08:23.399
Now, Michael, lay down.

01:08:24.359 --> 01:08:26.359
On your back. And...

01:08:26.439 --> 01:08:28.880
Yeah, all the way over. See if you can clench this.

01:08:28.960 --> 01:08:30.800
Now look like you're in pain.

01:08:30.880 --> 01:08:32.279
DANNY: Ooh! (SHUTTER CLICKS)

01:08:35.240 --> 01:08:37.640
It took my friend a whole summer
to learn how to swim.

01:08:38.040 --> 01:08:39.359
How're you gonna teach me so quick?

01:08:39.560 --> 01:08:41.960
I'm gonna do it the same way
my grandfather taught me.

01:08:42.319 --> 01:08:43.520
(EXCLAIMS)

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:47.319
Don't worry.

01:08:47.399 --> 01:08:49.520
It took Grandpa eight hours to teach us.

01:08:49.600 --> 01:08:50.600
It was a nightmare.

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:53.560
But there's two of us here now, and we're sober.

01:08:53.640 --> 01:08:55.000
You're gonna be fine.

01:08:55.840 --> 01:08:57.279
All right. You're doing great.

01:08:57.439 --> 01:08:59.120
Is he doing great? He's doing great.

01:08:59.240 --> 01:09:00.800
Okay. We want to advance a little, though.

01:09:00.880 --> 01:09:02.800
I need you to swim to Uncle Eddie.

01:09:02.880 --> 01:09:04.399
If you get there without touching the bottom,

01:09:04.479 --> 01:09:05.800
we'll give you a dolphin cookie.

01:09:06.319 --> 01:09:08.319
(MIMICKING DOLPHIN)

01:09:08.399 --> 01:09:09.760
Is that what your grandpa gave you?

01:09:10.160 --> 01:09:12.920
No, Grandpa gave us something he'd call a Heineken.

01:09:12.960 --> 01:09:14.000
I want one of those.

01:09:14.080 --> 01:09:15.319
No. Stick with the dolphin cookie.

01:09:15.439 --> 01:09:18.160
Yeah. They hurt less when they
get thrown at your head.

01:09:18.279 --> 01:09:19.760
God, he was a sick man.

01:09:19.840 --> 01:09:22.160
Yeah. Okay? Are we ready?

01:09:22.200 --> 01:09:23.600
Don't think about it. Commit. Kick, kick.

01:09:23.640 --> 01:09:25.439
Get the cookie. Move your feet.

01:09:27.200 --> 01:09:28.640
Kick, kick!

01:09:28.800 --> 01:09:30.640
Right there! Reach for it! You got it!

01:09:30.800 --> 01:09:31.840
Doing good, buddy!

01:09:33.680 --> 01:09:34.960
There you go!

01:09:35.120 --> 01:09:37.120
My boy! That was terrific, buddy.

01:09:37.200 --> 01:09:39.680
Have your cookie. We're gonna move on, though.

01:09:39.800 --> 01:09:41.080
PALMER: Hey, Devlin?

01:09:42.319 --> 01:09:44.200
Devlin? Yeah?

01:09:44.600 --> 01:09:46.560
So, Danny's birthday is next week,

01:09:46.640 --> 01:09:48.240
and I have no idea what to get him.

01:09:48.520 --> 01:09:49.760
(GROANS)

01:09:51.160 --> 01:09:52.840
Well, don't get him a tie.

01:09:52.920 --> 01:09:55.080
He has 100 of them and he never wears them.

01:09:55.200 --> 01:09:56.240
That's good to know.

01:09:56.800 --> 01:09:58.640
He loves books on tape for his car.

01:09:58.720 --> 01:09:59.920
Fishing gear.

01:10:00.440 --> 01:10:02.640
Loves it. Doesn't use it.

01:10:02.720 --> 01:10:04.200
Can't take the fish off of the hook

01:10:04.280 --> 01:10:06.200
once he catches it, so he just collects it.

01:10:06.880 --> 01:10:10.240
He loves candy. Jelly Bellies. Loves them, his favorite.

01:10:10.320 --> 01:10:12.320
But he only likes the Cotton Candy
and the Peanut Butter.

01:10:12.400 --> 01:10:14.520
So you have to buy the bag of the Jelly Bellies,

01:10:14.600 --> 01:10:16.160
separate the Cotton Candy and the Peanut Butter

01:10:16.240 --> 01:10:17.320
and put them into a little...

01:10:17.520 --> 01:10:19.320
It's a kind of Ziploc baggies that I got online.

01:10:19.400 --> 01:10:21.360
You know so much about him.

01:10:22.400 --> 01:10:23.520
Yeah.

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:26.440
I've known the guy forever.

01:10:28.280 --> 01:10:30.400
Music. Loves music.

01:10:30.680 --> 01:10:32.760
But anything after '95, don't bother.

01:10:32.840 --> 01:10:34.040
You'll lose him.

01:10:34.560 --> 01:10:36.440
That's when I finished my Girl Scouts.

01:10:38.720 --> 01:10:40.280
All right. How many cookies do we got left?

01:10:41.040 --> 01:10:42.280
Maybe about forty!

01:10:42.800 --> 01:10:45.080
What do you think, 40 feet for 40 cookies?

01:10:45.120 --> 01:10:46.880
Can you handle that? You need a little rest?

01:10:46.920 --> 01:10:48.040
Let's do this.

01:10:48.320 --> 01:10:51.120
Really? Okay, he's ready! He's ready to rock!

01:10:51.240 --> 01:10:52.520
Almost.

01:10:52.880 --> 01:10:53.920
What? No.

01:10:54.120 --> 01:10:57.920
Oh, my! Ladies and gentlemen, off come the floaties!

01:10:58.200 --> 01:10:59.920
This is getting serious!

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:01.160
Are you sure about this, Michael?

01:11:01.400 --> 01:11:02.960
Hell, yeah. All right.

01:11:03.080 --> 01:11:05.120
No matter what, you're a good man, okay?

01:11:05.600 --> 01:11:07.480
Keep kicking. I'm here if you need me.

01:11:07.600 --> 01:11:08.600
You got this.

01:11:08.720 --> 01:11:10.240
Go! Go, Michael!

01:11:10.440 --> 01:11:11.880
DANNY: Go! Breathe! Yeah!

01:11:12.280 --> 01:11:13.560
Kick it! Go!

01:11:13.640 --> 01:11:15.080
Move your arms! Yeah!

01:11:15.360 --> 01:11:16.680
(ALL CHEERING)

01:11:16.720 --> 01:11:18.400
He doesn't have floaties on!

01:11:18.800 --> 01:11:20.080
Oh, my God!

01:11:20.320 --> 01:11:21.480
DANNY: Get the cookies!

01:11:21.840 --> 01:11:23.400
KATHERINE: Come on, sweetheart! You've got it!

01:11:23.480 --> 01:11:24.520
A little bit more, little bit more.

01:11:27.400 --> 01:11:29.240
Swim! Swim! KATHERINE: Oh, my God!

01:11:29.320 --> 01:11:30.680
EDDIE: Come on! Just a little bit more!

01:11:32.080 --> 01:11:33.600
Keep going, Michael! Don't give up!

01:11:37.480 --> 01:11:38.720
(ALL CHEERING)

01:11:40.160 --> 01:11:41.320
EDDIE: Very nice!

01:11:41.520 --> 01:11:44.240
That's my boy! Yeah, buddy!

01:11:44.320 --> 01:11:47.920
I did it! I did it! Thank you!

01:11:48.080 --> 01:11:49.640
No way, that was you, buddy.

01:11:49.800 --> 01:11:52.200
That was awesome. Way to go!

01:12:00.480 --> 01:12:01.800
What are we looking at?

01:12:02.040 --> 01:12:04.640
Jeez. Oh, God. Devlin. (GROANS)

01:12:05.680 --> 01:12:08.640
Devlin. Oh, God. You snuck up on me.

01:12:08.880 --> 01:12:10.400
Did I? Oh... Yes.

01:12:10.600 --> 01:12:13.080
Do you startle easily? That's a sign of menopause.

01:12:13.160 --> 01:12:14.160
Hmm...

01:12:14.240 --> 01:12:15.800
Devlin?

01:12:15.840 --> 01:12:18.040
Palmer Dodge, this is Devlin.

01:12:18.160 --> 01:12:20.200
She and I went to college together.

01:12:20.880 --> 01:12:23.280
This is Palmer Dodge. DEVLIN: Aloha, Palmer.

01:12:23.680 --> 01:12:25.200
Is this your daughter?

01:12:26.160 --> 01:12:29.040
No, no, no. I'm actually the girlfriend.

01:12:29.120 --> 01:12:30.200
Whose girlfriend?

01:12:30.320 --> 01:12:32.720
Yes, hi. (GREETS IN GERMAN)

01:12:32.880 --> 01:12:36.080
I am the Dolph. Willkommen.
And you're very beautiful.

01:12:36.160 --> 01:12:38.320
Married, flattered. Thanks. Where's Danny?

01:12:38.600 --> 01:12:42.080
Danny is in the water teaching
our little boy how to swim.

01:12:42.200 --> 01:12:43.320
(EXCLAIMING) Hi, Doctor!

01:12:44.400 --> 01:12:45.400
He was so sweet.

01:12:45.520 --> 01:12:47.720
You know what's so crazy is that
I have never met anybody

01:12:47.840 --> 01:12:49.200
with the first name Devlin before.

01:12:49.240 --> 01:12:51.920
You know, and here you are, and
your name's Devlin and...

01:12:52.080 --> 01:12:53.400
Shark attack!

01:12:54.880 --> 01:12:57.480
We are playing Bavarian pool rugby
and now I'm in the lead.

01:12:57.680 --> 01:12:58.880
Okay, bye!

01:13:00.720 --> 01:13:03.240
She's trying to beat me, but she won't.

01:13:03.600 --> 01:13:05.320
No one can! (LAUGHING MANIACALLY)

01:13:05.400 --> 01:13:06.480
This is fun!

01:13:06.680 --> 01:13:08.920
Anyway, something's opened
up in our schedule tonight.

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:10.600
So, we were wondering if you and Danny

01:13:10.680 --> 01:13:11.920
were good to go for dinner.

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:14.280
Oceano's. Seven o'clock. Oh, no...

01:13:14.400 --> 01:13:17.560
Oh, no, you don't! She's like a shark. Come on.

01:13:18.040 --> 01:13:19.840
Is it a bad night? Are you two fighting?

01:13:19.920 --> 01:13:21.560
No! We're not fighting.

01:13:21.640 --> 01:13:23.760
No, we just, we're delighting. We're just fine.

01:13:23.840 --> 01:13:26.560
No, that's great. Tonight's gonna
happen. Yeah, perfect.

01:13:26.640 --> 01:13:28.440
Perfect. Anyway, see you tonight!

01:13:28.480 --> 01:13:29.760
Okay, Devlin.

01:13:29.880 --> 01:13:31.920
Oh, my God! Dolph, let her breathe!

Well, I'd like to start off by saying

01:22:28.560 --> 01:22:32.520
that I love the most that you fixed your teeth.

01:31:30.800 --> 01:31:32.840
KATHERINE: Did you see the look
on her face? DANNY: Yes.

01:31:32.920 --> 01:31:35.080
Do you understand what joy that brought me?

01:31:35.200 --> 01:31:36.520
How about the look on her face

01:31:36.600 --> 01:31:37.840
when you were doing the juggling, though?

01:31:37.920 --> 01:31:39.240
The juggling was the highlight for me.

01:31:39.320 --> 01:31:40.800
That was pretty good. You liked that?

01:31:40.880 --> 01:31:41.960
It was so cute.

01:31:42.080 --> 01:31:44.280
And when you talked about her arms getting done?

01:31:44.400 --> 01:31:46.120
The good news is she's beating the hell

01:31:46.200 --> 01:31:47.400
out of the iPod guy right now.

01:31:47.560 --> 01:31:48.600
Right now, I know.

01:31:50.080 --> 01:31:52.200
That was good. That was really fun.

01:31:52.400 --> 01:31:54.880
You know what, I think that was the first time

01:31:54.960 --> 01:31:56.400
that you and I have ever

01:31:57.560 --> 01:32:00.760
gone out, you know, just us.

01:32:00.920 --> 01:32:02.240
I know. I do.

01:32:02.320 --> 01:32:03.920
I feel bad for the Soul Patch now.

01:32:04.600 --> 01:32:05.640
I do.

01:32:05.760 --> 01:32:07.240
Now that you've been out with a real man.

01:32:07.400 --> 01:32:09.680
And by a real man, I mean a man who showers.

01:32:09.760 --> 01:32:11.320
(LAUGHING)

01:32:11.960 --> 01:32:14.680
I think it's so adorable

01:32:14.760 --> 01:32:17.240
how obsessed you are with this guy.

01:32:17.280 --> 01:32:19.520
I just can't picture you guys on
a date, you know what I mean?

01:32:19.720 --> 01:32:21.400
Who said it was a date ever?

01:32:21.600 --> 01:32:22.920
You. You.

01:32:23.120 --> 01:32:25.240
You get very excited when you talk to this man.

01:32:25.360 --> 01:32:29.280
Listen, Dr. Gervitz is moving his
practice to New York City.

01:32:29.400 --> 01:32:30.440
Yeah.

01:32:30.520 --> 01:32:33.080
Brian is not gonna go with him, and he...

01:32:33.320 --> 01:32:35.960
He's just been asking me if

01:32:36.800 --> 01:32:39.960
I would want to, you know, replace him.

01:32:40.480 --> 01:32:41.800
You're going?

01:32:42.440 --> 01:32:43.600
No.

01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:45.440
You can't do that to me.

01:32:45.600 --> 01:32:47.600
I just wanted to see how you'd react.

01:32:47.680 --> 01:32:49.960
Look at you. You can't live without me.

01:32:50.120 --> 01:32:51.520
"What do I do? How do I sign it?

01:32:51.600 --> 01:32:52.920
"How do I pay for it?"

01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:55.840
No. You kind of played with me a little bit, though.

01:32:55.960 --> 01:32:58.640
You could've told me that earlier.

01:32:58.720 --> 01:33:00.160
You're just messing with me?

01:33:00.240 --> 01:33:02.000
Trying to get me a little jealous, weren't you?

01:33:02.120 --> 01:33:04.960
No. I just was having fun teasing you.

01:33:05.160 --> 01:33:07.600
That was fun. Why? Were you jealous?

01:33:08.120 --> 01:33:11.440
No. Get outta here. Was I jealous? No.

01:33:11.520 --> 01:33:15.240
Look at you. You're grinning, you
can't stop, what is that smile?

01:33:15.320 --> 01:33:16.800
I didn't know you had that many teeth.

01:33:16.960 --> 01:33:19.600
I know. I got like 55 teeth.

01:33:19.680 --> 01:33:21.040
(BOTH LAUGHING)

01:33:21.520 --> 01:33:23.240
No. So there's nothing?

01:33:23.840 --> 01:33:26.000
You and... There's nothing?

01:33:26.320 --> 01:33:27.480
No love connection?

01:33:27.680 --> 01:33:29.880
No. Mmm-mmm. Nothing.

01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:32.040
Well, then, that's a shame.

01:33:32.240 --> 01:33:33.280
What?

01:33:33.840 --> 01:33:36.360
That coconut getting in the way tonight.

01:33:36.560 --> 01:33:37.800
That's a shame, don't you think? Oh.

01:33:37.960 --> 01:33:39.520
No. No, that was bad.

01:33:39.720 --> 01:33:40.760
The coconut.

01:33:40.840 --> 01:33:42.000
You're lucky that coconut was there.

01:33:42.200 --> 01:33:45.160
You couldn't... You wouldn't
have been able to handle it.

01:33:45.520 --> 01:33:47.000
Maybe you're right.

01:33:50.040 --> 01:33:52.840
You got more tricks that I don't know about?

01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:54.120
I don't know.

01:33:54.200 --> 01:33:55.360
Okay.

01:33:55.560 --> 01:33:57.760
I don't know anything.

01:33:58.480 --> 01:33:59.520

01:34:01.400 --> 01:34:02.960
Hi, guys!

01:34:03.040 --> 01:34:04.840
Hey! What're you doing?

01:34:05.040 --> 01:34:06.800
The babysitter fell asleep.

01:34:06.880 --> 01:34:08.040
Oh, great.

01:34:08.200 --> 01:34:09.320
I mean, come on,

01:34:09.400 --> 01:34:11.040
it's like a Hawaiian Rosa, huh?

01:34:11.880 --> 01:34:13.200
Is it? Oh, my God.

01:34:13.400 --> 01:34:14.520
DANNY: Yeah, that's asleep.

01:34:14.600 --> 01:34:15.680

01:34:22.240 --> 01:34:23.680
All right. Good to see you guys.

01:34:23.840 --> 01:34:25.240
Good night.

01:34:25.520 --> 01:34:27.760
Good job. One more day of lying, guys.

01:34:27.880 --> 01:34:29.720
We're almost done. Home stretch.

01:34:29.880 --> 01:34:32.600
All right. So, you gotta go to sleep.

01:34:33.200 --> 01:34:34.240
Yeah.

01:34:34.360 --> 01:34:36.200
Tired? Yes. Good night.

01:34:36.360 --> 01:34:38.080
Okay. That was fun. Good job.

01:34:40.120 --> 01:34:41.600
Good night. Good night.

01:34:41.960 --> 01:34:43.560
Good night. All right.

01:34:43.760 --> 01:34:44.760
Okay, Danny.

01:34:45.400 --> 01:34:47.400
Okay, good luck. I'll see you in the morning.

(EXCLAIMS) Hello! There he is, Danny!

01:35:25.440 --> 01:35:26.600
It's nice to meet you.

01:35:26.800 --> 01:35:27.920
Where were you going?

01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:29.000
What?

01:35:29.120 --> 01:35:31.000
I was going... I was going to...

01:35:31.160 --> 01:35:32.200
Where were you guys?

01:35:32.280 --> 01:35:33.440
I was looking for you guys at...

01:35:33.640 --> 01:35:35.120
What happened? How was the dinner?

01:35:36.280 --> 01:35:39.800
Dolph gave mouth- to-mouth to a sheep.

01:35:39.960 --> 01:35:41.440
Yeah. And then we had a few drinks.

01:35:41.600 --> 01:35:45.680
Yes. It was choking and so I gave him sheep-P-R.

01:35:45.720 --> 01:35:47.360
(BOTH LAUGHING)

01:35:47.440 --> 01:35:50.120
But he was the black sheep of the family,

01:35:50.320 --> 01:35:54.320
but he was also white, if that makes any sense.

01:35:55.120 --> 01:35:57.600
And we've been talking about how
amazing this trip has been

01:35:57.680 --> 01:35:59.560
and how amazing you are.

01:35:59.640 --> 01:36:01.160
Yeah, all joking aside,

01:36:01.240 --> 01:36:03.000
it really has been first-class.

01:36:03.200 --> 01:36:06.200
And that, if the kids and I hadn't kept you so busy,

01:36:06.360 --> 01:36:08.360
that you might've had the time to do something

01:36:08.480 --> 01:36:10.200
you've been thinking about doing?

01:36:10.360 --> 01:36:12.360
The one ringy-dingy?

01:36:12.880 --> 01:36:15.480
Uh... Yeah, you told her about that?

01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:18.640
I don't need you to get me a ring, Danny.

01:36:18.720 --> 01:36:21.040
Let's just get married. Right here.

01:36:21.560 --> 01:36:22.640
What now?

01:36:22.720 --> 01:36:26.480
Why not? We're in Hawaii. Let's do it tomorrow.

01:36:26.920 --> 01:36:29.560
I mean, this has felt special from
the moment that we met.

01:36:29.640 --> 01:36:31.600
And I've seen the way that you are with the kids,

01:36:31.680 --> 01:36:34.440
and it's exactly the way I always
imagined my husband would be.

01:36:34.520 --> 01:36:36.400
Oh, man...

01:36:36.720 --> 01:36:38.600

01:36:38.640 --> 01:36:40.520

I have been looking everywhere for you.

No, no, I mean, why?

01:37:11.680 --> 01:37:13.840
Yeah, we are. But what do you think?

01:37:14.040 --> 01:37:15.840
What do you mean, what do I think?

01:37:16.200 --> 01:37:17.960
I mean, what does it matter what I think?

I think that's great.

01:37:20.720 --> 01:37:22.360
Thank you, Devlin.

01:37:22.720 --> 01:37:24.440
I really hope that you can be there tomorrow.

I can't.

01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:57.440
for your parents tomorrow and I found...

No, no, no. You don't have to do that.

which is ha-wowie, by the way, you're gonna love it.

01:42:12.800 --> 01:42:14.920
I promise you it is going to be

01:42:15.040 --> 01:42:17.960
the most wonderful day of your life, guaranteed.

01:42:18.200 --> 01:42:19.960
Devlin. Yeah.

01:42:20.080 --> 01:42:21.320
Oh! Palmer! I didn't...

01:42:25.080 --> 01:42:29.320
Well, you just look absolutely beautiful.

01:42:29.920 --> 01:42:31.800
Really? Thank you. Yes.

01:42:32.560 --> 01:42:34.080
Devlin, can I ask you something?

01:42:34.160 --> 01:42:35.240
'Course.

01:42:36.560 --> 01:42:38.480
Do you still want to be with Danny?

01:42:40.080 --> 01:42:41.160
Wait. What?

01:42:41.240 --> 01:42:42.800
Because I think that

01:42:44.600 --> 01:42:47.840
he still may be in love with you.

01:42:49.320 --> 01:42:50.560
Really?

01:42:52.680 --> 01:42:54.760
Why would you think that?

01:42:55.240 --> 01:42:58.240
He's always glowing when you're around.

01:42:58.400 --> 01:43:01.680
And he laughs at your jokes. He doesn't laugh at mine.

01:43:01.840 --> 01:43:06.240
Palmer, trust me, there is nothing
between me and Danny.

01:43:06.520 --> 01:43:08.280
We're just, you know,

01:43:08.800 --> 01:43:10.080
we're familiar.

01:43:11.520 --> 01:43:13.280
And you are the girl for him.

01:43:14.280 --> 01:43:15.760
He even told me that last night.

01:43:16.440 --> 01:43:19.440
My God, Devlin, this is such a relief

01:43:19.800 --> 01:43:23.440
because I could never stand a
chance going up against you.

01:43:23.600 --> 01:43:25.480
Turn around. Tell me if this fits.

01:43:25.640 --> 01:43:27.680
Put the hanger up your nose.

01:43:27.760 --> 01:43:28.880
(LAUGHS) Stop!

01:43:39.880 --> 01:43:41.160
Excuse me.

01:43:41.320 --> 01:43:42.720
Here you go. Thank you.

01:43:42.880 --> 01:43:44.160
Katherine!

01:43:44.400 --> 01:43:45.840
Katherine! Oh, Devlin.

01:43:46.000 --> 01:43:47.640
That was so much fun last night.

01:43:47.720 --> 01:43:48.800
I know.

01:43:49.160 --> 01:43:52.160
I am still trying to work out how you cheated.

01:43:52.840 --> 01:43:55.240
I didn't. That's what happened.

01:43:55.480 --> 01:43:57.680
So, where's Danny?

01:43:59.800 --> 01:44:01.000
Devlin...

01:44:01.800 --> 01:44:04.800
Danny's at his wedding.

01:44:05.320 --> 01:44:06.480
Come again?

01:44:06.640 --> 01:44:08.160
I was never married to him.

01:44:09.520 --> 01:44:11.360
All a big lie that I made up.

01:44:11.520 --> 01:44:12.760
Why?

01:44:13.360 --> 01:44:18.000
'Cause I couldn't stand the thought
of you knowing the truth.

01:44:18.040 --> 01:44:19.160
Really?

01:44:19.640 --> 01:44:22.320
So, yeah, I'm a single mother.

01:44:22.880 --> 01:44:24.400
I have two kids that I love

01:44:24.480 --> 01:44:25.880
more than anything in the world.

01:44:26.040 --> 01:44:29.920
I drive a Honda. Still have dial-up internet.

01:44:30.520 --> 01:44:34.200
I got a 2.7 GPA in college, not a 3.4.

01:44:34.960 --> 01:44:36.200
And while I'm at it telling the truth,

01:44:37.040 --> 01:44:38.400
I named my kids' poop after you.

01:44:40.560 --> 01:44:43.000
And I work for Danny. I'm his assistant.

01:44:43.040 --> 01:44:44.200
That's it.

01:44:44.680 --> 01:44:48.000
Really, I would never have guessed this.

01:44:48.040 --> 01:44:49.840
I mean, you two had a real connection.

01:44:51.040 --> 01:44:54.520
He's great. He's the greatest guy.

01:44:56.480 --> 01:44:59.120
And I might even be in love with him,

01:45:00.200 --> 01:45:02.120
but that doesn't really matter at this moment

01:45:02.240 --> 01:45:06.600
because he is getting married
to another person right now.

01:45:08.920 --> 01:45:10.720
lan and I are breaking up.

01:45:11.560 --> 01:45:14.760
What? What happened?

01:45:16.080 --> 01:45:18.240
Well, for starters, he's gay.

01:45:18.400 --> 01:45:19.520
He's gay?

01:45:19.600 --> 01:45:21.160
I mean, look at him.

01:45:21.320 --> 01:45:23.320
That's a strong muscle right there.

01:45:23.400 --> 01:45:24.880
I'm squeezing.

01:45:25.440 --> 01:45:26.840
Devlin, I gotta tell you,

01:45:26.920 --> 01:45:29.800
last night, with the ass grab of the coconut,

01:45:29.880 --> 01:45:31.880
little bit of a red flag.

01:45:31.960 --> 01:45:33.480
(LAUGHS)

01:45:33.560 --> 01:45:35.600
I've seen him do that with the soap.

01:45:35.680 --> 01:45:36.960

What about the iPod?

01:45:44.080 --> 01:45:45.760
Oh, he didn't invent shit.

01:45:45.840 --> 01:45:47.080
He didn't?

01:45:47.240 --> 01:45:49.800
No! He made his money suing the Dodgers

01:45:49.880 --> 01:45:52.000
after he got hit by a foul ball.

01:45:53.360 --> 01:45:56.800
Oh, God! That's so... What?

01:45:57.800 --> 01:45:59.440
Well, this is different.

01:45:59.760 --> 01:46:04.520
Yeah, why didn't we try this truth-telling thing before?

01:46:05.120 --> 01:46:06.360
I don't know.

01:46:07.440 --> 01:46:09.080
Hey. Hey.

01:46:10.360 --> 01:46:11.360
What?

01:46:11.440 --> 01:46:12.680
That's nice.

01:46:12.760 --> 01:46:14.960
It's nice to tell the truth. That's good.

01:46:15.160 --> 01:46:16.560
The truth is fun, isn't it?

01:46:16.720 --> 01:46:18.120
Like, were you telling the truth

01:46:18.160 --> 01:46:19.880
when you said you might be in love with me?

01:46:20.640 --> 01:46:22.440
I'm gonna leave you two. Okay.

01:46:22.600 --> 01:46:24.480
I'm gonna go get a divorce. Good luck.

01:46:26.280 --> 01:46:27.600
(LAUGHING)

01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:32.440
Wait, where are my kids?

01:46:32.960 --> 01:46:35.280
Palmer took them out for ice cream.

01:46:36.080 --> 01:46:38.400
So, how was the wedding?

01:46:38.480 --> 01:46:39.840
Okay. All right.

01:46:39.880 --> 01:46:43.880
So, we're standing on top of this beautiful cliff. Uh-huh.

01:46:44.000 --> 01:46:47.240
I start looking out into the Pacific,

01:46:47.320 --> 01:46:48.880
and I think to myself,

01:46:49.000 --> 01:46:53.760
"Wow. I am about to start my life

01:46:54.360 --> 01:46:55.880
"with the one I love."

01:46:57.680 --> 01:46:59.640
And the only problem was,

01:46:59.720 --> 01:47:02.160
the one I love was not with me.

01:47:03.480 --> 01:47:04.560
She wasn't?

01:47:04.640 --> 01:47:05.840
She was not.

01:47:06.840 --> 01:47:08.640
So you didn't?

01:47:08.840 --> 01:47:10.040
I couldn't.

01:47:10.080 --> 01:47:11.320
You couldn't.

01:47:11.920 --> 01:47:16.320
I mean, don't we have something extra

01:47:16.360 --> 01:47:17.720
happening with us?

01:47:19.520 --> 01:47:21.040
Danny, I...

What happens when we're not on fake-cation

01:47:26.760 --> 01:47:29.960
and you wake up and realize this is real?

01:47:30.120 --> 01:47:33.040
You are the only real thing I've ever had in my life.

01:47:33.240 --> 01:47:35.400
Danny, come on, man. I don't...

01:47:35.560 --> 01:47:38.600
She's beautiful and she's... I'm not twenty-three.

01:47:40.400 --> 01:47:42.360
I'm not that.

01:47:42.560 --> 01:47:44.480
She's good, she's very nice,

01:47:44.520 --> 01:47:47.240
there's only one problem. She's not you.

01:47:47.480 --> 01:47:48.560
She's not you.

01:47:49.560 --> 01:47:51.240
I have two kids.

01:47:51.560 --> 01:47:54.920
