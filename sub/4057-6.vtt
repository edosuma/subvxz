WEBVTT

00:00.976 --> 00:02.512
Previously on Teen Wolf.

00:02.536 --> 00:04.080
What does the book do?

00:04.104 --> 00:05.649
It triggers the memory
centers of the brain.

00:05.673 --> 00:06.984
If you've seen them,

00:07.008 --> 00:09.174
if they've done
something to you...

00:10.711 --> 00:12.411
Then the book
will help you remember.

00:13.748 --> 00:15.392
You brought a Kitsune.

00:15.416 --> 00:16.460
Kira, please stop.

00:16.484 --> 00:18.095
I'm not doing anything.

00:18.119 --> 00:19.862
It's just happening.

00:19.886 --> 00:21.631
I think I might have stopped
her from killing Lucas.

00:21.655 --> 00:23.233
I mean, she nearly
took off his head.

00:23.257 --> 00:24.323
Kira!

00:26.560 --> 00:27.760
Hey, slow down.

00:33.167 --> 00:34.367
Come on, we gotta get up. Run!

00:36.504 --> 00:37.803
It was her. Who?

00:39.140 --> 00:40.472
Desert Wolf.

00:42.243 --> 00:43.409
Don't worry, Stiles.

00:44.544 --> 00:45.704
I'm just gonna eat your legs.

01:39.867 --> 01:40.867
Come on.

01:56.784 --> 01:58.095
Wait... What is that?

01:58.119 --> 01:59.279
A bronchodilator. It'll work.

02:04.458 --> 02:05.624
Malia, come on...

02:06.293 --> 02:07.293
Run!

02:30.251 --> 02:31.450
Watch out!

02:40.494 --> 02:41.894
We never should
have read that book.

03:56.570 --> 03:57.903
Chimeras.

03:58.606 --> 03:59.683
Two dead Chimeras.

03:59.707 --> 04:01.518
And eight new ones.

04:01.542 --> 04:02.986
So, that's 10 in all.

04:03.010 --> 04:04.010
I'm thinking maybe 11.

04:08.282 --> 04:09.326
Our station tech guys

04:09.350 --> 04:11.328
confirmed something for me...

04:11.352 --> 04:16.399
They said, both the holding
cell lock and cameras

04:16.423 --> 04:18.863
could have malfunctioned because
of something electromagnetic.

04:20.293 --> 04:22.806
You said that, uh, these guys...

04:22.830 --> 04:23.873
Dread Doctors.

04:23.897 --> 04:25.508
Are we really calling them that?

04:25.532 --> 04:26.943
So they broke Donovan out?

04:26.967 --> 04:28.567
It's how they got into
Eichen, isn't it?

04:33.474 --> 04:34.539
Donovan's a Chimera.

04:35.376 --> 04:36.441
Yeah.

04:37.811 --> 04:38.922
But...

04:38.946 --> 04:41.046
Is he a failure like
Lucas and Tracy?

04:43.984 --> 04:46.685
If he is, he's probably dead.

04:49.556 --> 04:50.822
Not until I've seen a body.

04:59.633 --> 05:01.500
You're
uncharacteristically quiet.

05:02.736 --> 05:03.835
Yeah... Sorry, I'm, uh...

05:05.372 --> 05:06.932
I'm just trying
to think about it. Uh...

05:07.675 --> 05:08.940
These are all teenagers, right?

05:10.444 --> 05:11.955
So, now shouldn't we be

05:11.979 --> 05:14.546
trying to figure out
why these teenagers?

05:15.416 --> 05:16.693
If the Dread Doctors,

05:16.717 --> 05:18.295
if they went through all that...

05:18.319 --> 05:20.319
Burying them, killing them,

05:21.622 --> 05:22.932
breaking one of them
out of jail...

05:22.956 --> 05:24.601
They couldn't have been
chosen at random.

05:24.625 --> 05:26.503
They had to have
something in common.

05:26.527 --> 05:28.827
Something that made them right

05:29.630 --> 05:30.896
for this experiment.

05:32.466 --> 05:34.333
Something that
made them special.

05:40.407 --> 05:41.951
Arms up.

05:41.975 --> 05:43.520
This way you can block attacks
to your face and your head

05:43.544 --> 05:45.304
while always keeping
your eyes on your enemy.

05:45.713 --> 05:46.778
Ready?

05:52.086 --> 05:53.763
It's all right.

05:53.787 --> 05:55.907
You're not going to be
perfect after only a few tries.

05:56.590 --> 05:57.590
I'm okay.

05:58.459 --> 05:59.602
Keep going.

05:59.626 --> 06:01.338
You sure?

06:01.362 --> 06:02.572
Maybe we should
stop after a few.

06:02.596 --> 06:03.989
Why?

06:04.013 --> 06:05.408
I don't want to get your
stitches to get un-stitched.

06:05.432 --> 06:06.432
They're fine.

06:09.670 --> 06:11.570
See? No blood.

06:19.446 --> 06:20.446
Ready when you are.

06:32.526 --> 06:33.670
What did you do wrong?

06:33.694 --> 06:35.505
Uh... I forgot to
keep my arms up.

06:35.529 --> 06:36.906
Right.

06:36.930 --> 06:38.608
But don't worry. Your
muscles have memory.

06:38.632 --> 06:40.472
With enough practice,
they'll remember for you.

07:01.822 --> 07:02.888
What's wrong? What is it?

07:03.590 --> 07:04.656
Muscle memory.

07:07.194 --> 07:09.472
So, basically, we're looking
for abnormal behavior?

07:09.496 --> 07:11.256
Anyone acting a little
off or a little weird.

07:13.500 --> 07:15.260
Isn't everyone a little
weird in high school?

07:15.969 --> 07:17.102
Yeah, good point.

07:20.107 --> 07:22.908
You remember Tracy went on
a killing spree after reading that?

07:24.111 --> 07:25.989
You think it's a bad idea?

07:26.013 --> 07:29.559
I think Malia almost getting run
down by a car could've been bad.

07:29.583 --> 07:31.783
Well, that's why you guys
haven't finished it, right?

07:32.653 --> 07:33.653
We're going to.

07:35.088 --> 07:38.468
Scott, I came here
hoping to find a pack.

07:38.492 --> 07:40.770
I wasn't planning on
watching one fall apart.

07:40.794 --> 07:42.138
The book's all we've got.

07:42.162 --> 07:43.162
Then I'll read it too.

07:48.135 --> 07:50.447
My mom's book club
usually has more wine.

07:50.471 --> 07:51.748
Well, they also
probably didn't read books

07:51.772 --> 07:53.104
that cause
violent hallucinations.

07:53.974 --> 07:55.040
That's why Malia's here.

07:56.610 --> 07:58.176
So none of us go
running into traffic?

08:00.647 --> 08:02.091
Or worse.

08:02.115 --> 08:03.515
Like what happened to Judy.

08:05.085 --> 08:06.151
Chapter 14.

08:09.923 --> 08:12.001
Maybe I should have
my mother read it.

08:12.025 --> 08:13.503
She might remember
a girl with a tail

08:13.527 --> 08:15.839
leaping off the ceiling
and attacking everyone.

08:15.863 --> 08:16.863
Yeah, if it works.

08:17.664 --> 08:18.842
It has to.

08:18.866 --> 08:20.098
What's that mean?

08:21.235 --> 08:23.668
I think I saw them
during my surgery.

08:26.807 --> 08:28.327
When I look at
the cover of the book...

08:31.078 --> 08:33.089
It's almost like...

08:33.113 --> 08:34.679
A memory trying to surface.

08:37.284 --> 08:38.928
Yeah.

08:38.952 --> 08:40.792
Isn't that what Valack
wanted when he wrote it?

08:41.822 --> 08:42.953
If they did something to me,

08:44.124 --> 08:45.290
I want to know what it is.

09:35.208 --> 09:36.241
Anyone feel anything yet?

09:37.644 --> 09:38.644
Tired.

09:40.347 --> 09:41.624
Hungry.

09:41.648 --> 09:42.814
I think he meant the book.

09:54.294 --> 09:56.005
What did you do
to your shoulder?

09:56.029 --> 09:57.109
What are you talking about?

09:58.365 --> 10:00.143
I can smell
the blood. What happened?

10:00.167 --> 10:01.644
Jeep died on me again.

10:01.668 --> 10:03.548
I went to check the engine,
the hood fell on it.

10:11.878 --> 10:14.958
Wait, so, how much... How
much do you remember anyway?

10:14.982 --> 10:17.193
With the accident, did it play
like a movie in your head

10:17.217 --> 10:19.150
or was it like being
completely in it again?

10:20.187 --> 10:21.264
In it.

10:21.288 --> 10:22.688
Was it just the crash?
Nothing else?

10:27.694 --> 10:28.893
Nothing.

10:44.911 --> 10:46.623
You're not giving up, are you?

10:46.647 --> 10:47.779
Just resting my eyes.

10:59.926 --> 11:01.137
My glow stick broke.

11:01.161 --> 11:03.006
No, it ran out of glow.

11:03.030 --> 11:04.874
They don't last forever.

11:04.898 --> 11:05.898
Can I have my money back?

11:10.404 --> 11:11.970
God, I hate all-ages night.

11:16.009 --> 11:18.021
Forty-three dollars.

11:18.045 --> 11:19.088
I said I don't want your money.

11:19.112 --> 11:20.990
You said I owe you 200.

11:21.014 --> 11:22.914
Liam, just forget it...

11:29.756 --> 11:31.067
Perfect.

11:31.091 --> 11:32.924
Hayden... Hayden.

11:35.062 --> 11:36.873
I gotta be honest, Liam.

11:36.897 --> 11:38.841
If you're trying to be a
good guy, I really don't care.

11:38.865 --> 11:41.444
I'm just trying to make up
for the sixth grade.

11:41.468 --> 11:43.268
Nothing will make up
for the sixth grade.

11:46.973 --> 11:48.273
Come on.

12:00.187 --> 12:01.453
You want to keep hating me?

12:01.855 --> 12:03.366
Go for it.

12:03.390 --> 12:05.034
You said I owe you 200.

12:05.058 --> 12:06.157
So, here's 43 more.

13:17.330 --> 13:19.175
What if we need
some kind of trigger?

13:19.199 --> 13:21.244
Wasn't Malia driving when
she remembered the crash?

13:21.268 --> 13:24.781
Yeah, but how are we supposed to
trigger a memory that we don't remember?

13:24.805 --> 13:26.315
Maybe it's a delayed thing.

13:26.339 --> 13:28.739
Maybe you have to wait a couple
of hours to see what happens.

13:39.352 --> 13:40.952
That wasn't me. I swear.

13:43.089 --> 13:44.901
We keep an eye on
each other today, okay?

13:44.925 --> 13:46.235
Yes, and keep an eye
out for eight other

13:46.259 --> 13:48.437
potentially homicidal Chimeras.

13:48.461 --> 13:50.161
And keep an eye out
for the Dread Doctors.

13:52.933 --> 13:54.573
Starting to see the
appeal of a third eye.

13:57.103 --> 13:59.982
So while introducing the
African Cane Toad,

14:00.006 --> 14:01.417
sounded like a good way to deal

14:01.441 --> 14:04.387
with Australia's infestation
of the grey-backed beetle,

14:04.411 --> 14:07.579
unfortunately, the toad also
decided to eat everything else in sight.

14:10.317 --> 14:12.094
And everything
that tried to eat the toad,

14:12.118 --> 14:14.130
from crocodiles
to household pets,

14:14.154 --> 14:16.899
quickly died from
the poison they secreted.

14:16.923 --> 14:19.502
A perfect example of an
invasive species.

14:19.526 --> 14:22.305
One-hundred and two toads
introduced in 1935

14:22.329 --> 14:25.096
became 1.5 billion by 2010.

14:27.534 --> 14:30.568
Once an invasive species is
introduced, everything changes.

14:38.278 --> 14:39.644
Wise decision, Sydney.

14:42.649 --> 14:45.583
Lydia, you know
it's for the best.

15:03.637 --> 15:05.203
I was just looking for your mom.

15:06.673 --> 15:08.139
I mean Mrs. Martin.

15:09.042 --> 15:10.042
Are you okay?

15:12.379 --> 15:13.678
Does this look okay?

15:17.150 --> 15:18.194
How long has it been happening?

15:18.218 --> 15:19.284
Three years.

15:20.020 --> 15:21.020
Years?

15:22.989 --> 15:24.022
It's stress.

15:25.258 --> 15:27.503
I've tried everything.

15:27.527 --> 15:32.008
Medication, acupuncture,
hypnosis.

15:32.032 --> 15:34.232
Have you tried not taking
the hardest classes in school?

15:36.937 --> 15:38.414
Let me see it.

15:38.438 --> 15:40.038
Maybe I can help cover it up.

16:00.026 --> 16:03.361
Lydia, I told you
to stay in the car.

16:09.502 --> 16:11.636
Stay in the car!

16:46.306 --> 16:47.572
Why have you done this?

16:58.251 --> 16:59.617
I told you to stay in the car.

17:00.086 --> 17:01.230
Lydia!

17:01.254 --> 17:03.321
I said, stay in the car!

17:05.657 --> 17:07.090
They're coming, Lydia.

17:08.261 --> 17:10.560
They're coming for all of us.

17:12.298 --> 17:13.298
Lydia.

17:14.733 --> 17:15.800
Are you okay?

17:18.171 --> 17:19.737
I'm okay. I'm fine.

17:20.607 --> 17:21.806
You remembered something.

17:23.576 --> 17:25.108
Not about the Dread Doctors.

17:26.613 --> 17:28.223
Nothing about them
or the surgery.

17:28.248 --> 17:29.414
What was it?

17:36.489 --> 17:40.236
My grandmother. At Eichen House.

17:40.260 --> 17:42.527
Lydia? Lydia?

17:43.430 --> 17:45.307
Oh, my God, what happened?

17:45.331 --> 17:47.065
Are you all right?
Mom, I'm fine.

17:48.201 --> 17:49.812
It was nothing.

17:49.836 --> 17:52.270
Was it a blackout?
Did you faint?

17:54.074 --> 17:55.074
Yeah.

17:56.476 --> 17:57.775
Yeah, I fainted.

18:00.313 --> 18:01.313
Mom, I'm fine.

18:02.182 --> 18:03.281
I promise.

18:10.390 --> 18:11.789
Not into sci-fi?

18:13.259 --> 18:15.504
That's the book, isn't it?

18:15.528 --> 18:17.573
I thought you guys were supposed
to finish reading it last night.

18:17.597 --> 18:20.865
Yeah, I kind of haven't yet.

18:23.503 --> 18:24.713
I don't know what's
wrong with me.

18:24.737 --> 18:25.737
I mean, I can't...

18:26.806 --> 18:29.273
I can barely read it.

18:29.709 --> 18:31.175
Okay, uh...

18:33.413 --> 18:36.392
This is gonna sound weird but...

18:36.416 --> 18:37.782
Do you speak Japanese?

18:38.785 --> 18:40.696
No. I'm also half-Korean

18:40.720 --> 18:42.398
and I don't speak Korean.

18:42.422 --> 18:43.942
And I'm pushing
a C-average in English.

18:44.691 --> 18:46.502
Okay, well...

18:46.526 --> 18:48.737
I've been doing some
reading on Kitsunes.

18:48.761 --> 18:50.406
How come?

18:50.430 --> 18:51.496
'Cause I met one.

18:51.831 --> 18:54.143
Oh, right.

18:54.167 --> 18:56.868
Do you know why people in Japan
answer the phone "moshi moshi"?

18:57.370 --> 18:58.614
Moshi means hello.

18:58.638 --> 19:00.416
Yeah, but there's a reason

19:00.440 --> 19:02.618
why you have to say it
twice on the phone.

19:02.642 --> 19:05.521
Because according to
Japanese folklore,

19:05.545 --> 19:09.658
fox spirits have
difficulty with language.

19:09.682 --> 19:11.293
And the way that you
prove that you're not a fox,

19:11.317 --> 19:14.130
when you answer the phone,
say "moshi" twice.

19:14.154 --> 19:16.265
The important part is...

19:16.289 --> 19:19.702
"Moshi moshi" confuses Kitsunes

19:19.726 --> 19:21.192
because it's a language trick.

19:22.529 --> 19:24.540
So is the book.

19:24.564 --> 19:28.299
You know, it's just
one long language trick.

19:29.536 --> 19:30.868
That's why I can't read it?

19:32.238 --> 19:33.905
It's affecting
the fox part of you.

19:35.241 --> 19:36.241
Confusing it.

19:40.313 --> 19:41.946
I swear that wasn't me.

19:52.325 --> 19:53.357
You forgot to sign it.

19:58.665 --> 20:00.698
Are you going to tell me
why you're dropping?

20:02.635 --> 20:04.313
It's a schedule thing.

20:04.337 --> 20:06.248
Why did you take this
class to begin with?

20:06.272 --> 20:07.950
Isn't it a prerequisite for
the college you want?

20:07.974 --> 20:09.618
It just doesn't matter.

20:09.642 --> 20:11.487
It's too much...

20:11.511 --> 20:12.688
time, too much work.

20:12.712 --> 20:13.878
To become a veterinarian?

20:18.751 --> 20:19.962
Scott?

20:19.986 --> 20:21.586
I don't think you should drop.

20:32.665 --> 20:33.731
Scott?

20:45.678 --> 20:46.844
What's happening?

20:49.415 --> 20:50.926
I think...

20:50.950 --> 20:53.295
I'm having an asthma
attack. Someone...

20:53.319 --> 20:54.319
Someone get the nurse!

21:08.501 --> 21:10.346
Mom...

21:10.370 --> 21:12.570
You're okay, sweetheart. You
just need to breathe, okay?

21:15.675 --> 21:17.008
Where's Roxy?

21:19.012 --> 21:20.278
Tell me.

21:24.450 --> 21:25.450
Where's Roxy?

21:26.653 --> 21:27.730
Try not to talk.

21:27.754 --> 21:29.999
Mom, tell me.

21:30.023 --> 21:31.555
Sweetheart, she didn't make it.

21:33.726 --> 21:34.792
Scott.

21:37.063 --> 21:38.562
Scott, you need to breathe.

21:46.072 --> 21:47.916
Scott? Scott, look at me.

21:47.940 --> 21:49.518
I need to know
where your inhaler is.

21:49.542 --> 21:50.542
Is it in your locker?

21:50.843 --> 21:52.203
Scott.

21:52.227 --> 21:53.589
Some... Someone's
got to have an inhaler.

21:53.613 --> 21:54.812
One of you, find someone.

21:55.515 --> 21:56.392
Scott.

21:56.416 --> 21:57.548
Scott.

21:57.850 --> 21:58.916
Scott.

22:23.710 --> 22:25.287
I don't know, dude.

22:25.311 --> 22:26.889
Everyone at Devenford's
pretty abnormal to me.

22:26.913 --> 22:28.090
All right. What else is
there to look for?

22:28.114 --> 22:29.792
There's heightened strength,

22:29.816 --> 22:31.994
smell, hearing, speed...

22:32.018 --> 22:33.462
Uh, able to see in the dark.

22:33.486 --> 22:35.798
Glowing eyes. Eyes
that reflect the light.

22:35.822 --> 22:39.601
Visible scorpion stingers
protruding out of limbs?

22:39.625 --> 22:41.359
Yeah. Or three foot
lizard tails.

23:49.061 --> 23:50.806
Sorry.

23:50.830 --> 23:51.707
What's up with those two?

23:51.731 --> 23:53.008
Sixth grade.

23:53.032 --> 23:54.109
That's not the best year

23:54.133 --> 23:55.800
for Liam's anger
management issues.

23:57.637 --> 23:59.014
There was a...

23:59.038 --> 24:00.883
This fight in the hallways.

24:00.907 --> 24:02.785
Liam and this other guy.

24:02.809 --> 24:05.943
Hayden sort of
accidentally walked into it.

24:07.113 --> 24:09.447
And this is her yearbook photo.

24:10.016 --> 24:12.494
Ah, damn. Yeah.

24:12.518 --> 24:13.951
Ow. What did she do to him?

24:17.757 --> 24:18.934
Does anyone here have asthma?

24:18.958 --> 24:20.090
Anyone got an inhaler?

24:22.195 --> 24:23.594
Scott!

24:28.484 --> 24:29.884
I've got it...
I've got the inhaler.

24:35.041 --> 24:36.106
Scott.

24:38.911 --> 24:40.110
Scott, come on.

24:43.983 --> 24:45.049
Scott.

24:57.663 --> 24:58.663
Thanks.

25:09.141 --> 25:10.853
Okay, then what are
we doing here

25:10.877 --> 25:12.637
if you've already had
your suppressed memory?

25:13.112 --> 25:14.623
It wasn't the right memory.

25:14.647 --> 25:16.558
I remembered my
grandmother in Eichen House.

25:16.582 --> 25:17.860
There was nothing
to do with the surgery,

25:17.884 --> 25:19.628
nothing to do with
the Dread Doctors.

25:19.652 --> 25:21.630
So, if I've read the book,

25:21.654 --> 25:23.165
why don't I have the full memory

25:23.189 --> 25:25.000
of my experience with them?

25:25.024 --> 25:26.802
I'm not supposed
to know that, am I?

25:26.826 --> 25:27.892
No, something...

25:29.028 --> 25:29.972
happened during the surgery.

25:29.996 --> 25:32.040
But now I think that

25:32.064 --> 25:33.944
maybe it has more to do
with me being a Banshee.

25:37.537 --> 25:38.702
It's not my memory, Stiles.

25:39.972 --> 25:41.272
It's someone else's.

26:25.885 --> 26:27.296
Why haven't you said anything?

26:27.320 --> 26:28.852
About what?

26:31.023 --> 26:32.156
The rest of my memory.

26:32.758 --> 26:33.758
The Desert Wolf.

26:36.963 --> 26:38.062
Why didn't you tell Scott?

26:39.231 --> 26:40.511
I didn't think you wanted me to.

26:44.303 --> 26:45.369
I don't.

26:48.774 --> 26:50.094
Are you going to
want to know why?

26:57.783 --> 26:58.916
Not really.

27:23.909 --> 27:25.229
You think you're
doing me a favor?

27:26.379 --> 27:27.878
Like I'm going to owe you now?

27:29.382 --> 27:30.781
I don't need any favors.

27:31.283 --> 27:32.349
Then what do you want?

27:32.952 --> 27:34.396
I want in the pack.

27:34.420 --> 27:36.198
That's not up to me.

27:36.222 --> 27:38.142
If you want to tell Scott
what you saw, tell him.

27:39.258 --> 27:40.698
If you've got
something else in mind,

27:42.895 --> 27:44.228
I'm okay with that, too.

28:01.981 --> 28:03.692
Oh, come on.

28:03.716 --> 28:06.177
You were supposed to
go wait in the parking lot.

28:06.201 --> 28:08.664
And you're supposed to be embarrassed
by your parents, not your sister.

28:08.688 --> 28:10.966
By the way, guess
where I found this?

28:10.990 --> 28:13.068
In your jeans about to
go into the laundry.

28:13.092 --> 28:15.092
Do I have to remind you,
one bottle costs $200?

28:15.361 --> 28:16.427
Sorry.

28:17.863 --> 28:18.863
What?

28:19.198 --> 28:20.264
Nothing.

28:21.867 --> 28:22.978
Was that Liam Dunbar?

28:23.002 --> 28:24.068
He got cute.

28:37.349 --> 28:38.482
You gonna be okay?

28:40.486 --> 28:41.486
Yeah.

28:43.055 --> 28:44.121
Um...

28:45.991 --> 28:47.631
I think it was just
the memory hitting me.

28:48.761 --> 28:49.860
Psychosomatic thing.

28:54.433 --> 28:55.873
Did you want to
talk about something?

28:57.002 --> 28:58.002
No. It can wait.

28:58.804 --> 29:00.170
No, no, it's okay.

29:00.906 --> 29:02.718
What's up?

29:02.742 --> 29:04.842
Last night, you
guys all fell asleep,

29:06.112 --> 29:08.223
I went upstairs
to check on Kira.

29:08.247 --> 29:11.293
She was sleeping. But...

29:11.317 --> 29:12.597
You heard her speaking Japanese?

29:13.152 --> 29:14.218
I didn't just hear it.

29:23.496 --> 29:25.095
That's what she said
at the club.

29:26.465 --> 29:28.165
I found a website
that can translate it.

29:29.401 --> 29:31.980
It means, roughly...

29:32.004 --> 29:33.303
"I am the messenger of death."

29:36.008 --> 29:37.008
Does it get worse?

29:45.151 --> 29:47.031
Yeah, something...
Something's happening to her.

29:47.853 --> 29:49.419
She's got this aura around her.

29:50.556 --> 29:51.900
It's hard to explain.

29:51.924 --> 29:53.401
Um...

29:53.425 --> 29:54.792
It's supposed to be part of her,

29:57.429 --> 29:59.307
but now it looks different.

29:59.331 --> 30:01.465
Like... Almost like
it's taking over.

30:02.968 --> 30:04.034
I don't know.

30:05.171 --> 30:06.336
Something's happening.

30:08.040 --> 30:09.339
And to be honest...

30:10.843 --> 30:12.220
What?

30:12.244 --> 30:14.111
I don't know if I can
trust her anymore.

30:27.059 --> 30:28.458
I hear it, too.

30:30.429 --> 30:31.629
It's coming from the basement.

30:36.569 --> 30:37.649
Can you turn the lights on?

30:44.944 --> 30:45.944
Uh, not going on.

30:46.512 --> 30:48.490
Ask someone.

30:48.514 --> 30:51.259
Hey, I thought this was
more of an auditory thing.

30:51.283 --> 30:52.983
I still want to
see what I'm hearing.

30:53.619 --> 30:54.619
Makes sense.

31:02.428 --> 31:04.339
We've been having issues
for the last hour.

31:04.363 --> 31:06.241
Maintenance is
coming to check it out.

31:06.265 --> 31:09.377
For now, that floor is
down to back-up lighting.

31:09.401 --> 31:11.146
I thought you said this
was more of a hearing thing.

31:11.170 --> 31:12.402
Auditory, yeah. Yeah.

31:13.906 --> 31:15.205
It's also a Lydia thing.

31:55.547 --> 31:57.147
This definitely isn't Kira.

32:00.052 --> 32:01.184
It's a Chimera.

32:58.210 --> 32:59.443
Mom.

33:01.981 --> 33:03.458
Where's Kira?
Still at the library.

33:03.482 --> 33:05.093
Stiles and Lydia
are at the hospital.

33:05.117 --> 33:07.044
Doing what?

33:07.068 --> 33:08.997
Lydia's trying to figure out what
happened during her surgery.

33:09.021 --> 33:10.648
How long are they
going to be there?

33:10.672 --> 33:13.072
They said they're just waiting
for the power to come back on.

33:29.508 --> 33:32.220
Well, the base pay is crap,

33:32.244 --> 33:34.404
but with tips, you can make
up to a grand in one night.

33:35.214 --> 33:36.380
Let's see what you've got.

33:40.185 --> 33:41.262
Maybe less.

33:41.286 --> 33:43.164
It's $25.

33:43.188 --> 33:44.421
Liam, please stop.

33:45.357 --> 33:46.490
I promised I'd pay you back.

33:47.526 --> 33:48.570
It doesn't matter now.

33:48.594 --> 33:50.327
And Phil takes
half of it anyway.

33:54.767 --> 33:56.378
I know it's for your medication.

33:56.402 --> 33:58.113
So please, just take the money.

33:58.137 --> 34:00.582
No. It wasn't your fault.

34:00.606 --> 34:01.646
I punched you in the face.

34:03.675 --> 34:04.675
I meant the shots.

34:08.280 --> 34:09.357
It's for mycophenolate.

34:09.380 --> 34:14.228
It's for a kidney transplant
I had a few years ago.

34:14.253 --> 34:16.572
I work here so my sister
doesn't have to pay for all of it.

34:18.357 --> 34:19.790
Now, could you just
forget about it?

34:21.427 --> 34:22.467
I'll make it back somehow.

34:24.596 --> 34:25.676
Does Phil really take half?

34:27.766 --> 34:29.277
And never stops
bragging about it.

34:29.301 --> 34:30.567
Just listen to him.

34:34.473 --> 34:37.085
It's not like they're
going to do anything.

34:37.109 --> 34:39.909
They're all under the table and too
young to be selling alcohol anyway.

34:42.214 --> 34:43.214
Hayden.

34:45.184 --> 34:46.428
Can I ask you to do
something else for me?

34:46.452 --> 34:47.516
What?

34:50.522 --> 34:51.165
Close your eyes.

34:51.188 --> 34:52.188
Are you kidding? Please?

34:53.324 --> 34:54.623
No. Just for two seconds.

34:55.793 --> 34:57.527
I swear, I am not
gonna do anything.

34:58.297 --> 35:00.358
Why?

35:00.382 --> 35:02.444
All you have to do is close
your eyes for three seconds.

35:02.468 --> 35:04.668
You said two. Okay, well,
three. Three at the most.

35:11.510 --> 35:12.387
This is stupid.

35:12.411 --> 35:13.610
Just one second.

35:23.622 --> 35:24.855
Okay. Open them.

35:36.702 --> 35:38.246
Please.

35:38.270 --> 35:39.270
Please, don't hurt me.

35:39.671 --> 35:41.149
Please.

35:41.173 --> 35:42.173
Please, don't hurt me.

35:58.657 --> 35:59.823
Your condition worsens.

36:07.900 --> 36:09.166
Mom?

36:09.868 --> 36:10.934
Mom, what are you doing?

36:11.537 --> 36:12.602
Claudia.

36:20.479 --> 36:21.599
What are you doing up there?

36:24.216 --> 36:25.936
I couldn't stand to be
in that room anymore.

36:26.919 --> 36:28.863
Not with him
looking at me like that.

36:28.887 --> 36:30.787
Claudia...
He's trying to hurt me.

36:32.558 --> 36:34.591
I don't care if you don't
believe me, but he is.

36:35.561 --> 36:36.693
He's trying to kill me.

36:41.366 --> 36:42.432
No.

36:44.403 --> 36:45.468
That's not true.

36:46.438 --> 36:47.571
Come on down.

36:53.812 --> 36:55.378
Come here.

36:57.316 --> 36:59.616
You have to remind
yourself. It's the disease.

37:03.488 --> 37:04.854
Remember what the dementia does?

37:06.525 --> 37:07.824
It gives you delusions.

37:09.428 --> 37:11.639
It makes you think that
people are out to get you...

37:11.663 --> 37:13.908
You don't see
the way he looks at me.

37:13.932 --> 37:15.643
Claudia, he's 10 years old.

37:15.667 --> 37:17.734
He's trying to kill me.

37:27.312 --> 37:28.556
Stop it.

37:28.580 --> 37:30.925
Stop looking at me
like that. Stop it!

37:30.949 --> 37:33.394
Stop looking at me!

37:33.418 --> 37:34.963
Mom... What are you do...

37:34.987 --> 37:36.453
Mom...

37:42.327 --> 37:43.471
You guys try to find
Stiles and Lydia.

37:43.495 --> 37:44.495
I'm gonna find my mom.

39:19.524 --> 39:20.657
Come on.

39:37.442 --> 39:39.122
What is that? A
bronchodilator. It'll work.

39:43.749 --> 39:45.660
Malia, come on!

39:45.684 --> 39:46.750
Run!

40:20.018 --> 40:21.484
We never should have
read that book.

40:52.717 --> 40:53.850
Stiles...

40:56.455 --> 40:57.899
You can't say anything.

40:57.923 --> 41:00.089
Please, don't say anything.

41:01.226 --> 41:02.492
Why not?

41:03.829 --> 41:05.562
Because I never said
anything about Donovan.
