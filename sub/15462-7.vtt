Kids: WE'RE FREE!
WE'RE FREE!

19:59.865 --> 20:01.867
{\an1}SUPER NANNY USED US!
GET HER!

20:01.950 --> 20:03.744
TAKE THAT! AND THAT!

20:03.827 --> 20:06.955
{\an5}Captain Hero: AS THE
MINI-TROOPERS TORE SUPER
NANNY LIMB FROM LIMB,

20:07.039 --> 20:10.959
{\an4}I COULDN'T HELP BUT THINK
THAT THERE WAS VERY LITTLE
POINT TO THIS NONSENSE,

20:11.043 --> 20:12.920
BUT IF THERE'S ANY
SEMBLANCE OF A LESSON HERE,

20:13.003 --> 20:17.382
{\an5}IT'S THAT JUST BECAUSE
SOMEONE HAS THE WORD "SUPER"
IN FRONT OF THEIR NAME,

20:17.466 --> 20:19.551
THAT DOESN'T
MAKE THEM SUPER.

20:19.635 --> 20:22.304
{\an5}ON THE OTHER HAND,
IF YOU PUT "LE"
IN FRONT OF A WORD,

20:22.387 --> 20:24.014
IT DOES MAKE IT CLASSY.

20:24.097 --> 20:27.309
{\an5}LIKE LESBIAN,
THE CLASSIEST WOMEN
OF THEM ALL.

20:27.392 --> 20:29.853
{\an1}LOOKS LIKE YOU KIDS
HAVE THIS UNDER CONTROL.

20:29.937 --> 20:30.896
HYAH!

20:30.979 --> 20:33.273
[CRASH]

20:33.357 --> 20:36.526
{\an1}I'M OFF TO DEFEAT
THE EVIL SUPERCUTS!

20:40.656 --> 20:43.867
YOU WIN THIS TIME,
SUPERCUTS!
