WEBVTT

00:01.527 --> 00:03.360
All right,
Professor Proton fans,

00:03.429 --> 00:05.629
get ready to meet
Dr. Sheldon Cooper

00:05.698 --> 00:09.166
and Dr. Amy Farrah Fowler,
a pair of real-life scientists

00:09.235 --> 00:11.702
who may win the Nobel Prize.

00:11.770 --> 00:13.737
That's like
the Kids' Choice Award,

00:13.806 --> 00:18.141
but with more science
and less slime.

00:18.210 --> 00:19.676
Hi, thanks for having us.

00:19.745 --> 00:20.978
Kids' Choice Award?

00:21.046 --> 00:22.746
Why would they let kids
choose anything?

00:22.815 --> 00:25.682
They're basically
human larvae.

00:25.751 --> 00:28.318
Well, they are kind of
our target audience.

00:31.957 --> 00:33.924
Greetings, children.

00:33.993 --> 00:36.493
Toys, am I right?

00:36.562 --> 00:39.663
He is. He has hundreds of them.

00:39.732 --> 00:41.265
So you two have
discovered something

00:41.333 --> 00:43.600
that a lot of people
are really excited about.

00:43.669 --> 00:45.102
(chuckles) We have.

00:45.170 --> 00:46.737
Now, before
you explain it,

00:46.805 --> 00:50.407
keep in mind that our
average viewer is this many.

00:50.476 --> 00:54.278
Okay, imagine you're
looking in a mirror.

00:54.346 --> 00:56.847
The image you see
looks just like you.

00:56.915 --> 00:58.882
That's called symmetrical.

00:58.951 --> 01:01.351
Now imagine you have
a billion mirrors,

01:01.420 --> 01:04.288
and each of them reflects
one thing about you correctly

01:04.355 --> 01:06.890
and a billion things
about you incorrectly.

01:06.959 --> 01:09.226
And imagine the set
of incorrect things

01:09.295 --> 01:12.729
are floating in an abstract
n-dimensional hyperspace.

01:12.798 --> 01:16.733
Now imagine there was never
a mirror to begin with.

01:18.337 --> 01:19.569
Oh, was that
a doorbell?

01:19.638 --> 01:20.937
I didn't
hear anything.

01:23.042 --> 01:24.808
(doorbell rings)

01:24.877 --> 01:27.210
Huh, there it is again.

01:27.279 --> 01:28.578
Sheldon, why don't
you answer it?

01:28.647 --> 01:30.881
But I don't know who it is.

01:30.949 --> 01:34.818
Maybe it's a special guest who
I invited just to surprise you.

01:34.887 --> 01:36.920
Why don't you open it up
and find out.

01:36.989 --> 01:39.089
This is a terrible message
to send to children.

01:39.158 --> 01:40.490
Children, you never
open the door

01:40.559 --> 01:42.392
if you don't know
who's on the other side.

01:42.461 --> 01:44.494
You always make your
mommy or daddy do it

01:44.563 --> 01:46.763
while you hide under the bed
and try to imagine

01:46.832 --> 01:49.900
what your superhero name will be
when you avenge their deaths.

01:49.968 --> 01:52.669
I'll get it.

01:52.738 --> 01:54.905
But it can't be The Silver
Shadow-- that's mine.

01:57.376 --> 01:59.009
Hello.

02:01.213 --> 02:04.181
Captain on the bridge!
Captain on the bridge!

02:05.484 --> 02:06.950
You're William Shatner.

02:07.019 --> 02:08.285
You can call me Bill.

02:08.354 --> 02:09.686
Ooh, can I call you Captain?
No.

02:09.755 --> 02:11.655
Please?
No.

02:11.724 --> 02:13.757
(whispers):
Please?

02:13.826 --> 02:15.125
Sure.

02:16.662 --> 02:19.029
And w-will you call me
Science Officer Cooper?

02:19.098 --> 02:20.864
This has got to stop.

02:20.933 --> 02:23.700
I think you know
how to make it stop.

02:23.769 --> 02:26.303
Put her there,
Science Officer Cooper.

02:28.674 --> 02:31.608
Put her there,
Science Officer Cooper.

02:31.677 --> 02:35.178
(Sheldon vomits)

02:35.247 --> 02:37.547
Oh, poor Shatner.

02:37.616 --> 02:39.983
Poor Shatner?
I have to eat lunch now.

02:40.052 --> 02:43.153
Look, Sheldon's
pretty embarrassed,

02:43.222 --> 02:44.788
so when he gets here,
we should...

02:44.857 --> 02:47.190
Make fun of him?
(chuckles) A lot.

02:47.259 --> 02:48.992
Guys, don't you think
that's a little mean?

02:49.061 --> 02:49.708
Yeah.

02:49.732 --> 02:51.295
Okay, just so we're
all on the same page.

02:51.296 --> 02:52.396
Yeah.

02:52.464 --> 02:53.797
- Hello.
OTHERS: Hey.

02:53.866 --> 02:55.532
So, Sheldon,
did you get

02:55.601 --> 02:57.946
William Shatner's autograph,
or maybe his dry cleaning bill?

02:57.970 --> 02:58.902
(chuckles)

02:58.971 --> 03:01.304
Very funny, get it all out.

03:01.373 --> 03:02.873
Like you did on William Shatner?

03:04.943 --> 03:07.010
Raj, do you have
something to add?

03:07.079 --> 03:10.080
You brought shame upon
yourself and your family.

03:10.149 --> 03:13.150
It's not funny,
but it's true.

03:13.218 --> 03:16.019
I will admit the meeting
did not go the way I wanted.

03:16.088 --> 03:19.189
(à la Shatner): Because you barfed where no man
has barfed before?

03:20.559 --> 03:23.860
Well, the next time I meet him,
it will go better.

03:23.929 --> 03:26.696
Next time? What makes you think
there's gonna be a next time?

03:26.765 --> 03:29.833
Wil will give me another chance.
He thinks the world of me.

03:29.902 --> 03:32.035
Aw. One of the reasons
I love you

03:32.104 --> 03:34.738
is you actually believe that.

03:34.807 --> 03:36.247
Thank you.

04:24.351 --> 04:26.884
Now's not a good time, Sheldon.

04:26.953 --> 04:29.887
For what?
You.

04:29.956 --> 04:32.557
I need to apologize.

04:32.626 --> 04:34.559
Apology accepted.
MAN: Wil, come on,

04:34.628 --> 04:35.727
I cast fireball,

04:35.795 --> 04:37.328
you need to roll
your dexterity save.

04:37.397 --> 04:38.763
I'll be right there.

04:38.832 --> 04:41.065
Are you playing
Dungeons & Dragons?

04:41.134 --> 04:42.600
- No.
MAN 2: Would you hurry up,

04:42.669 --> 04:44.569
man, the map says
this dungeon's

04:44.638 --> 04:47.405
full of dragons.

04:47.474 --> 04:50.908
Still no.
Who are you playing with?

04:50.977 --> 04:53.444
Ugh... it's just some friends,
you don't know them.

04:53.513 --> 04:54.445
SHATNER:
Wheaton, get back here.

04:54.514 --> 04:55.780
Hobgoblins
are at the gate,

04:55.849 --> 04:59.617
and you're at the door
buying Girl Scout Cookies.

05:01.888 --> 05:03.688
Is that William Shat...?
Nope.

05:07.761 --> 05:10.762
Hey, you guys want to read
my fan fiction mash-up,

05:10.830 --> 05:12.430
"Captain Marvelous Mrs. Maisel"?

05:14.067 --> 05:16.000
- Nope. - No.
- Certainly not.

05:16.069 --> 05:17.502
You don't even know
what it's about.

05:17.570 --> 05:18.936
Is it about
a superhero

05:19.005 --> 05:20.705
who finds her voice
by doing stand-up?

05:20.774 --> 05:23.808
That's so much better
than what I had.

05:24.944 --> 05:27.845
Mine is just a Jewish girl
that flies.

05:27.914 --> 05:30.715
I'd read that.

05:30.784 --> 05:33.117
Guys, guys,
Wil Wheaton

05:33.186 --> 05:35.320
hosts a secret
celebrity D&D game.

05:35.388 --> 05:36.688
How do you know?
Who was there?

05:36.756 --> 05:38.389
Why are you damp?

05:38.458 --> 05:40.792
I was trying to peek
in Wil's window,

05:40.860 --> 05:42.327
and he turned the sprinklers on.

05:42.395 --> 05:45.863
Oh, that means they
must be really famous.

05:45.932 --> 05:47.799
I'm almost positive
I heard William Shatner.

05:47.867 --> 05:50.068
I wonder who else is playing.

05:50.136 --> 05:53.838
I-I bet we can use graph theory
to determine who Wil knows

05:53.907 --> 05:56.207
and who is likely to play D&D.
Yes.

05:56.276 --> 06:01.179
Okay, obviously he's connected
to the whole <i>Next Gen</i> cast...

06:01.247 --> 06:04.382
So this is the rest
of our night, huh?

06:04.451 --> 06:06.417
Oh, no,

06:06.486 --> 06:08.753
this is the rest of our lives.

06:10.423 --> 06:15.059
And Josh Brolin gets
you to every Avenger.

06:15.128 --> 06:17.195
Kevin Smith's
in this article

06:17.263 --> 06:18.696
about celebrities who play D&D.

06:18.765 --> 06:20.231
Oh! A-And he was
on Wil's podcast,

06:20.300 --> 06:21.899
so they know each other.

06:21.968 --> 06:23.234
G-Go on his Instagram,

06:23.303 --> 06:24.463
see if you can find anything.

06:24.504 --> 06:26.337
Yeah, he-he posted something
an hour ago:

06:26.406 --> 06:27.872
"#GameNight."

06:27.941 --> 06:30.742
That looks like Wil's house.

06:30.810 --> 06:32.243
William Shatner,

06:32.312 --> 06:34.445
Kevin Smith--
who else could be there?

06:34.514 --> 06:36.881
Do you see what I see
over his shoulder?

06:36.950 --> 06:39.584
Is that a ghost?

06:40.820 --> 06:42.754
I think it's Stuart.

06:45.024 --> 06:48.459
That <i>is</i> Stuart.
What-What's he doing there?

06:48.528 --> 06:50.461
Maybe he died in Wil's house

06:50.530 --> 06:53.131
and he can't leave
until he solves his own murder.

06:55.135 --> 06:58.403
Why would Wil invite
Stuart and not us?

06:58.471 --> 07:00.304
I know the answer.
Yeah.

07:00.373 --> 07:02.240
We all know the answer.

07:16.656 --> 07:17.922
Hey, guys.

07:17.991 --> 07:20.425
You're home late.

07:20.493 --> 07:22.727
Uh, yeah.

07:22.796 --> 07:26.464
I had a crazy night.
I went to the pharmacy.

07:26.533 --> 07:29.600
I like to be there when
the new decongestants drop.

07:29.669 --> 07:31.769
Cut the crap.
We know where you were.

07:31.838 --> 07:33.171
We know what
you were doing.

07:33.239 --> 07:37.341
Yeah, I just told you. I was
at CVS breathing my ass off.

07:37.410 --> 07:38.654
Oh, you were breathing,
all right.

07:38.678 --> 07:40.678
You were breathing the
rarefied air of celebrities.

07:40.747 --> 07:41.991
I don't know what
you're talking about.

07:42.015 --> 07:43.181
Then why are
you trembling?

07:43.249 --> 07:45.016
I'm always trembling.

07:45.084 --> 07:46.851
We know you were
at Wil's D&D game.

07:46.920 --> 07:47.985
We saw you on Instagram.

07:48.054 --> 07:49.632
We just want to know
how you got invited.

07:49.656 --> 07:53.825
I can't talk about it or they
won't invite me back next week.

07:53.893 --> 07:55.526
So there's another
game next week.

07:55.595 --> 07:57.595
I didn't mean to say that.

07:57.664 --> 07:59.464
Who's in it?
I can't tell you!

07:59.532 --> 08:01.966
How do we get invited?
I don't know!

08:02.035 --> 08:04.469
How many hit dice are they
playing the wereboar as having?

08:04.537 --> 08:08.105
12d8 + 24--
I mean, I don't know!

08:11.077 --> 08:13.010
(phone ringing)

08:14.280 --> 08:15.813
Hey, Stuart.

08:15.882 --> 08:17.962
I don't want to play anymore.
It's too much pressure.

08:19.452 --> 08:21.886
Why, what happened?
I've-I've said too much.

08:21.955 --> 08:23.621
You haven't said anything.

08:23.690 --> 08:26.791
Not to you, to them.
Who's them?

08:26.860 --> 08:29.560
Ah! Now I <i>have</i> said too much!

08:32.565 --> 08:34.631
But y-you blocked
your number, right?

08:34.701 --> 08:35.832
Relax,

08:35.902 --> 08:39.303
this is not my first
creepy phone call.

08:39.371 --> 08:42.907
It's like riding a bike...
slowly past a girl's house.

08:44.577 --> 08:45.710
WHEATON (over phone):
Hello.

08:45.778 --> 08:46.911
(imitating Shatner):
Wil,

08:46.980 --> 08:48.546
Bill Shatner here.

08:50.383 --> 08:53.251
Is this Howard?

08:53.319 --> 08:56.821
Of course not. It-It's Shatner.

08:56.890 --> 09:00.491
If you don't believe me, ask my
good friend, Christopher Walken.

09:00.560 --> 09:03.261
(imitating Walken):
Hello, Bill and I are just

09:03.329 --> 09:06.731
hanging out...

09:06.799 --> 09:08.766
at The Polo Lounge.

09:08.835 --> 09:12.403
Mr. Shatner, Mr. Walken,
here are your martinis. (glass dings)

09:12.472 --> 09:13.749
(whispering in normal voice):
What are you doing?

09:13.773 --> 09:15.451
I'm filling out the world.
You're ruining it.

09:15.475 --> 09:17.041
No, he's not.

09:17.110 --> 09:19.877
Thanks, Wil.

09:26.953 --> 09:29.098
Sheldon, why are you walking
everywhere? Just get a horse.

09:29.122 --> 09:32.256
I had a horse.
It got hit by a train.

09:32.325 --> 09:33.591
Get another one.

09:33.660 --> 09:35.092
I can't just replace Chauncey.

09:35.161 --> 09:37.194
I'm still in the
grieving process.

09:37.263 --> 09:39.931
(phone ringing)

09:39.999 --> 09:41.299
Hey.

09:41.367 --> 09:43.768
Hey, Leonard, I have an opening
in my D&D game next week,

09:43.836 --> 09:45.948
and I was wondering if you
were interested in playing.

09:45.972 --> 09:47.471
Well, yes, thank you.

09:47.540 --> 09:49.073
Okay, great.

09:49.142 --> 09:51.375
Now, here's the thing,
you can't tell anyone.

09:51.444 --> 09:53.144
I'm serious,
not Howard, not Raj,

09:53.212 --> 09:54.812
and certainly not Sheldon.

09:54.881 --> 09:56.247
Okay.

09:56.316 --> 09:57.660
I'm really sorry
to put you in a position

09:57.684 --> 09:58.616
where you have to lie
to your friends...

09:58.685 --> 10:00.585
See you there!

10:02.055 --> 10:04.622
You come face to face
with a massive monster

10:04.691 --> 10:06.223
with a gaping maw

10:06.292 --> 10:11.162
full of teeth, three huge legs,
and flailing tentacles.

10:11.230 --> 10:13.431
What do you do?

10:13.499 --> 10:16.667
Fellas, it looks like
we're facing a, an otyugh.

10:18.304 --> 10:20.404
Here's the plan...

10:20.473 --> 10:22.573
Hold on there, Bill.

10:22.642 --> 10:24.108
Now what, Kareem?

10:25.578 --> 10:29.146
How do we know
it's not a Neo-otyugh?

10:29.215 --> 10:30.648
Same way I know
the difference

10:30.717 --> 10:32.350
between an owlbear
and a bugbear.

10:32.418 --> 10:34.318
Does that answer
your question?

10:34.387 --> 10:36.687
No.

10:40.393 --> 10:41.859
Look, there's one way
to settle this:

10:41.928 --> 10:43.461
we chop it up
and look at the pieces.

10:43.529 --> 10:46.364
Oh, come on, why do you always
got to attack everything?

10:46.432 --> 10:47.743
Why can't we just try
talking to it?

10:47.767 --> 10:51.869
Big surprise, Podcast
here wants to talk.

10:51.938 --> 10:53.971
What do you think, Leonard?

10:58.044 --> 11:01.779
I think this is the greatest day
of my entire life.

11:01.848 --> 11:05.316
It's all right, buddy,
one day you'll meet a girl.

11:11.572 --> 11:13.004
Hey, how was your lecture?

11:13.073 --> 11:15.083
Oh, it was so good.

11:15.084 --> 11:17.351
I-I-I mean, it-it started great,

11:17.420 --> 11:19.820
and then the, the middle
was great,

11:19.889 --> 11:21.500
and then the ending was like...
(imitates explosion)

11:21.524 --> 11:22.524
So great.

11:25.161 --> 11:29.697
Leonard, if you went to House
of Pies again, just say it.

11:29.765 --> 11:31.209
(stammers)
Wait, if you think I'm lying,

11:31.233 --> 11:32.513
why do you think
I'm eating pies?

11:32.568 --> 11:35.202
Why don't you think I'm...
having an affair?

11:35.271 --> 11:38.639
Listen, i-it's fine, just
next time, bring me a slice.

11:38.708 --> 11:42.209
Okay, well, if you
really want to know,

11:42.278 --> 11:43.777
I'll tell you where I was.

11:43.846 --> 11:46.547
I was at Wil's D&D game,
but that's all I can say.

11:46.615 --> 11:49.216
Oh, fun.
Were there famous people there?

11:49.285 --> 11:53.187
Ah, sorry, I-I-I can't
tell you that.

11:53.255 --> 11:55.155
Okay, well, yes,

11:55.224 --> 11:59.059
but I-I-I-I can't
tell you who.

11:59.128 --> 12:01.061
Well, no, I-I can
tell you Shatner,

12:01.130 --> 12:03.297
but that's only because
you already knew that one.

12:03.365 --> 12:04.898
Well, I'm glad you had fun.

12:04.967 --> 12:06.500
Yeah.

12:06.569 --> 12:08.836
Ugh, I wish I could tell you
who else was there.

12:08.904 --> 12:10.904
(chuckles)
I can't, I promised.

12:10.973 --> 12:13.507
Yeah, if it makes you feel
better, I couldn't care less.

12:13.576 --> 12:15.843
That's true,

12:15.911 --> 12:18.145
you don't care, so there's
no harm in telling you.

12:18.214 --> 12:19.913
Okay, you really
don't have to.

12:19.982 --> 12:22.516
All right,
I'll tell you. Uh...

12:22.585 --> 12:24.318
(stammers)
Kevin Smith was there,

12:24.386 --> 12:28.021
and-and, uh, this really
tall guy named Kareem.

12:28.090 --> 12:30.991
Wait-wait,
K-Kareem Abdul-Jabbar?

12:31.060 --> 12:34.194
I don't know, it was, uh,
Kareem something Jabbar.

12:36.432 --> 12:37.931
How do you know him?

12:38.000 --> 12:39.566
How do you not know him?

12:39.635 --> 12:42.169
Well, I know him now
'cause he was there.

12:42.238 --> 12:43.170
Wow.

12:43.239 --> 12:46.073
That is so cool.

12:46.142 --> 12:47.741
Oh, a-and that, uh,
the guy that played

12:47.810 --> 12:49.176
the werewolf on-on <i>True Blood,</i>

12:49.245 --> 12:52.012
he was there.
Wh-- Joe Manganiello?

12:52.081 --> 12:56.583
Uh, yeah.
From <i>Magic Mike?</i>

12:56.652 --> 12:59.286
What's that?

12:59.355 --> 13:01.421
Okay, okay,

13:01.490 --> 13:05.926
did he look... like this?

13:05.995 --> 13:08.729
He had his clothes on,
but, yeah.

13:08.798 --> 13:10.097
(sighs)

13:10.166 --> 13:11.765
I can't believe you
met Joe Manganiello.

13:11.834 --> 13:13.066
Is he nice?
Oh, he's so nice.

13:13.135 --> 13:16.103
I-I-I rolled my dice
underneath the couch,

13:16.172 --> 13:19.473
and he just lifted
it up, one hand.

13:19.542 --> 13:22.409
Oh, I-I bet he did.

13:24.947 --> 13:27.114
Hi. Okay, can you guys
keep a secret?

13:27.183 --> 13:28.315
Yeah.
Sure.

13:28.384 --> 13:30.751
Good, 'cause I can't.

13:30.820 --> 13:32.920
Leonard played
Dungeons & Dragons

13:32.988 --> 13:34.421
with the hot guy
from <i>Magic Mike.</i>

13:34.490 --> 13:38.058
I never got to see that movie.
Seriously?

13:38.127 --> 13:39.560
Yeah, Howie made us leave

13:39.628 --> 13:41.595
as soon as he realized
it wasn't about magic.

13:42.898 --> 13:46.266
Well, I have seen that movie
one or seven times,

13:46.335 --> 13:48.268
and trust me, it is magic.

13:50.139 --> 13:52.439
- Which guy?
- That one.

13:52.508 --> 13:54.975
Abracadabra.

13:57.079 --> 13:59.746
Hey, you know what was fun?

13:59.815 --> 14:02.616
That time we played
Dungeons & Dragons.

14:02.685 --> 14:06.687
That was fun.
We should play that more.

14:08.824 --> 14:10.958
Sorry, what now?

14:16.699 --> 14:18.265
Hey, what are you guys
doing here?

14:18.334 --> 14:20.767
Oh, I, uh, think Sheldon
might have left something.

14:20.836 --> 14:22.970
Oh, you mean, besides his lunch?

14:23.038 --> 14:24.671
(laughter)

14:26.242 --> 14:28.842
You are so funny, Wil.

14:28.911 --> 14:32.145
We were just talking
about how funny you are.

14:32.214 --> 14:33.881
Yeah, Leonard told you,
didn't he?

14:33.949 --> 14:35.382
- Yeah. Mm-hmm.
- Yup. - Yeah.

14:35.451 --> 14:37.050
It's Manganiello?

14:37.119 --> 14:38.685
- Uh-huh. - Mm-hmm.
- Mm-hmm.

14:38.754 --> 14:39.987
Feel good about yourselves?

14:40.055 --> 14:41.989
- Nope. - No.
- Yeah.

14:44.393 --> 14:46.960
Oh, we're going
with no? No.

14:49.265 --> 14:51.965
Hey, guys.

14:52.034 --> 14:53.800
What are you
smiling about?

14:53.869 --> 14:56.036
What? This is my regular face.

14:56.105 --> 14:58.005
No, it's not.

14:58.073 --> 15:00.908
Y-Your regular face
is more like this...

15:02.978 --> 15:07.748
No, no, i-it's-it's more
in the eyebrows, like this...

15:10.619 --> 15:13.387
(chuckles)
Okay, make your jokes.

15:13.455 --> 15:14.821
I'm still in a great mood.

15:14.890 --> 15:17.357
(phone ringing)

15:17.426 --> 15:20.027
Hey.

15:20.095 --> 15:21.428
Wait, what?

15:22.631 --> 15:25.365
Why?

15:25.434 --> 15:28.101
Oh, come on, but...

15:29.238 --> 15:32.940
O-Okay, fine.

15:33.008 --> 15:35.909
Huh, Raj was right,
it is more in the eyebrows.

15:37.179 --> 15:38.512
What was that all about?

15:38.580 --> 15:40.380
Wil kicked me out
of his D&D game.

15:41.850 --> 15:43.884
You were
in Wil's D&D game?

15:43.953 --> 15:45.786
With William Shatner?
And you didn't tell us?

15:45.854 --> 15:48.588
I'm sorry,
Wil made me promise not to.

15:48.657 --> 15:50.223
I thought
we were friends.

15:50.292 --> 15:52.559
Oh, come on, you guys
would do the same thing.

15:52.628 --> 15:54.227
No, we wouldn't!
I told you when I was

15:54.296 --> 15:55.862
in spin class with
Scarlett Johansson.

15:55.931 --> 15:57.898
It didn't even turn out
to be Scarlett Johansson.

15:57.967 --> 16:00.734
Well, that's her
fault, not mine!

16:00.803 --> 16:02.235
It doesn't matter

16:02.304 --> 16:05.138
because Penny blabbed about it
and now I'm out.

16:06.675 --> 16:09.209
So there's an open seat.

16:10.546 --> 16:12.112
Wil!
Wil Wheaton!

16:12.181 --> 16:14.114
Open! Open!

16:15.684 --> 16:17.884
No. No. No.

16:17.953 --> 16:19.252
Hell no.

16:19.321 --> 16:22.889
Look, we know Leonard is out.
You need to fill a seat.

16:22.958 --> 16:25.292
It should be one of us.

16:25.361 --> 16:26.727
Or give me another chance.

16:26.795 --> 16:29.396
I think me and Joe Manganiello
were really hitting it off.

16:29.465 --> 16:32.432
Joe Manganiello was there?
From <i>Magic Mike?</i>

16:32.501 --> 16:35.168
You guys suck.

16:35.237 --> 16:37.170
Agreed. You guys suck.
Let's go, Wil.

16:37.239 --> 16:38.772
No.

16:39.808 --> 16:41.508
All of you.

16:41.577 --> 16:43.410
You're just
trying to use me

16:43.479 --> 16:45.245
to get close
to my famous friends.

16:45.314 --> 16:46.913
Do you know how
that makes me feel?

16:46.982 --> 16:49.149
Flattered? (chuckles)

16:49.218 --> 16:51.151
Used.

16:51.220 --> 16:54.454
I was gonna
guess that.

16:54.523 --> 16:56.490
One of the worst things
about being a celebrity

16:56.558 --> 16:59.860
is you never know if people
like you for you.

16:59.928 --> 17:03.330
Well, thanks
for letting me know.

17:03.399 --> 17:04.830
(sighs)

17:04.900 --> 17:07.501
You're right, that was
really crappy of us.

17:07.569 --> 17:11.338
Yeah, I guess we just got
caught up in the excitement.

17:11.406 --> 17:14.273
We're sorry, Wil.
We do like you for you.

17:14.343 --> 17:15.776
And if it makes
you feel

17:15.844 --> 17:18.084
any better, I don't even really
consider you a celebrity.

17:23.752 --> 17:26.185
Should we go or do you want
to wait for the sprinklers?

17:32.071 --> 17:33.938
Guys, I-I still feel
a little bad about Wil.

17:34.006 --> 17:35.206
Me, too.

17:35.274 --> 17:38.642
Yeah. We should invite him
to come play with us.

17:38.711 --> 17:40.845
Ask him to bring
some chips

17:40.913 --> 17:42.446
because we're all out.

17:42.515 --> 17:44.448
(stammers)
Hey, Wil, this is Leonard.

17:44.517 --> 17:45.683
(gasps)
Make it Bugles.

17:45.751 --> 17:47.251
No, no, no, no, no,
pretzel sticks.

17:47.320 --> 17:48.752
No, no, no, Bugles.

17:49.889 --> 17:51.689
We're gonna play some D&D

17:51.757 --> 17:53.068
and thought you might
want to join us.

17:53.092 --> 17:54.303
Thank you, Leonard, but actually

17:54.327 --> 17:55.960
I can't do it tonight.

17:56.028 --> 17:57.962
Uh, how about another time?

17:58.030 --> 18:00.798
Okay, great. Thanks. Bye.

18:00.867 --> 18:02.800
Okay, where were we?

18:06.172 --> 18:10.274
I was about to go all
<i>Wrath of Khan</i> on the ogres.

18:10.343 --> 18:11.809
Oh, man, that's it.

18:11.878 --> 18:14.678
Put another dollar
in the <i>Star Trek</i> jar, Bill.

18:14.747 --> 18:17.214
Worth it.

18:18.618 --> 18:22.786
Speaking of putting
dollars in things...

18:25.791 --> 18:28.292
I loved you
in <i>Magic Mike.</i>

18:28.361 --> 18:30.361
(chuckles)
Thanks. (chuckles)

18:30.429 --> 18:31.962
Switch places with me.

18:34.267 --> 18:37.568
Are we playing musical chairs
or Dungeons & Dragons?

18:37.637 --> 18:41.071
Yeah, let's teach that ogre
what my broadsword tastes like.

18:41.140 --> 18:44.408
I like your moxie.

18:44.477 --> 18:47.311
Aw, and I like
your grandpa words.

18:53.219 --> 18:56.720
My dad and I watched you win
back-to-back championships.

18:56.789 --> 19:00.925
And I watched you sniff Joe's
hair when he wasn't looking.

19:04.997 --> 19:07.331
Thank you again for inviting us,
and don't worry,

19:07.400 --> 19:08.866
we won't tell the guys.

19:08.935 --> 19:11.368
You know what, why don't
you tell the guys?

19:11.437 --> 19:13.203
In fact, let's all
take a picture

19:13.272 --> 19:14.772
and send it to
them right now.

19:16.676 --> 19:20.344
(phones buzzing)

19:20.413 --> 19:22.179
That's weird.

19:26.919 --> 19:29.219
We deserve that.
