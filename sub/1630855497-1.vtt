WEBVTT

00:02.642 --> 00:08.273
It never begins. And thus, it never ends.

01:50.165 --> 01:51.125
What's wrong?

01:52.126 --> 01:55.213
- Is that not all of it?
- Too much of it.

03:33.394 --> 03:34.354
Garmen?

03:34.354 --> 03:35.438
- Garmen?
- No, no.

03:35.438 --> 03:37.399
- Not now. I told you--
- Every minute we do nothing,

03:37.399 --> 03:39.192
we look weak.
We look confused, right?

03:40.318 --> 03:43.529
The people. Our people. The community,
they're looking for answers.

03:43.529 --> 03:45.240
Cops, they're gonna let this shit go.

03:45.240 --> 03:48.118
- So, what do we do?
- Aked, it's up to your auntie.

03:48.118 --> 03:51.079
- You know that, right?
- She's not telling me nothing, though.

03:51.663 --> 03:53.123
Look, I love her, but this...

03:54.082 --> 03:56.126
- It's family. It's my family.
- All right.

03:56.751 --> 03:59.879
Ms. Mahabir, my condolences.
I'm sorry, ma'am.

04:00.463 --> 04:03.799
- I'm going back home for a few days.
- Home to Georgetown?

04:05.093 --> 04:08.429
- Back to Guyana. Why?
- To get some answers.

04:10.180 --> 04:13.143
Auntie, we have all the answers.

04:13.893 --> 04:18.815
- Edward Chung killed your brother-in-law.
- Aked, this isn't about Edward Chung.

04:19.524 --> 04:22.569
This is about something that happened
a long, long time ago.

04:22.569 --> 04:27.489
And I am going to get some guidance
on exactly how to respond.

04:28.324 --> 04:30.492
And believe me, I will respond.

04:32.370 --> 04:36.666
And when I do, I promise you'll be a part.

04:37.584 --> 04:41.044
- A big part.
- A big part. I promise that.

04:49.720 --> 04:51.096
"A long time ago," how?

04:52.514 --> 04:53.725
Yeah, I don't know.

05:04.443 --> 05:06.653
You're right to believe the bad things

05:06.653 --> 05:09.323
<i>happening to your family
are happening for a reason.</i>

05:10.158 --> 05:13.702
But I found the man
responsible for your misfortune,

05:14.788 --> 05:18.540
and he's willing to allow you
to reverse your family's fate.

05:19.459 --> 05:22.252
But you must be willing
to take certain steps,

05:22.628 --> 05:25.131
exactly as he prescribes them.

05:26.132 --> 05:28.175
- Are you willing?
- I am.

05:28.802 --> 05:33.098
You understand that to balance
the weight of his pain,

05:33.890 --> 05:37.351
to close the circle
of his own suffering,

05:38.143 --> 05:40.730
suffering which began many years ago

05:40.730 --> 05:43.816
at the hand of your late husband, Ranwell,

05:44.359 --> 05:49.863
you will have to inflict
a similar pain on his behalf.

05:52.491 --> 05:54.786
- I know.
- Okay, then.

05:55.787 --> 05:57.746
Here is where we begin.

06:44.502 --> 06:47.087
- Jared, honey, it's quarter of.
- I know.

06:47.087 --> 06:49.173
Is there anything I can do to help?
'Cause...

06:49.173 --> 06:51.967
- No, I'm coming.
- You didn't touch the avocado toast.

06:51.967 --> 06:53.802
I don't want you getting starved
by second period

06:53.802 --> 06:55.095
and eating from the vending machine.

06:55.095 --> 06:58.350
Mom, I ate earlier.
It was that Indian food from last night.

06:58.933 --> 07:00.059
Have you seen my cleats?

07:00.059 --> 07:03.062
They're in the new closet
with the outside shoes.

07:09.402 --> 07:13.323
<i>I have to say, I was kinda surprised
to see that pitch meeting on the schedule.</i>

07:13.323 --> 07:16.826
- We know we're gonna say no.
- No, we don't know that. And anyway,

07:16.826 --> 07:19.286
sometimes knowing why we're saying no
can be good too.

07:19.661 --> 07:21.998
Here's an idea,
how about your dad actually takes

07:21.998 --> 07:23.665
one of these meetings himself?

07:24.209 --> 07:26.294
You mean do the work part of work?

07:27.212 --> 07:28.879
He did not eat that Indian food.

07:30.631 --> 07:35.135
Okay, I'm putting your food and a water,
drink it, in your backpack.

07:35.553 --> 07:37.805
And bring home the Tupperware, okay?

07:37.805 --> 07:39.766
I'm picking you up after school, bud.
Don't run off.

07:39.766 --> 07:40.809
Dad, I know.

07:40.809 --> 07:42.519
All right, if you're gonna get the bus,
we gotta move.

07:45.354 --> 07:49.025
<i>We pay a generous upfront fee
to license his name and likeness,</i>

07:49.025 --> 07:53.071
<i>and all we'd ask is maybe once a year,
he gives us an appearance or two.</i>

07:53.655 --> 07:58.075
Plus, Chef Jeff and his family

07:58.575 --> 08:00.370
will always have a free room.

08:01.496 --> 08:02.914
Whether it's Atlantic City,

08:04.165 --> 08:05.416
Las Vegas,

08:06.835 --> 08:10.254
or the big wow, Macau.

08:11.797 --> 08:13.173
- Be in touch.
- Yeah.

08:18.638 --> 08:21.683
See? It's good to do sometimes,
these meetings.

08:23.393 --> 08:26.062
- So, what--
- Jacket copy, blurbs,

08:26.062 --> 08:28.814
and the publisher still needs you guys
to approve the cover image.

08:28.814 --> 08:31.151
- Okay.
- And they wanna know,

08:31.151 --> 08:35.529
- is he keeping the ponytail?
- I'm gonna let you handle that.

08:55.841 --> 08:57.760
Remember, all you need to do is--

08:57.760 --> 09:01.097
I know. I just-- I need to play nice
and don't interrupt.

09:01.097 --> 09:05.976
Exactly. Just state your case.
'Cause it's a good one. They need you.

09:05.976 --> 09:07.686
They should have put you
on this a year ago.

09:07.686 --> 09:09.564
Yeah, I would have turned somebody by now.

09:09.564 --> 09:11.649
Then my job wouldn't be
on the chopping block.

09:12.317 --> 09:13.485
- So...
- So, I know,

09:13.485 --> 09:16.528
I need to just stay present,
not talk about the past.

09:17.030 --> 09:19.656
I will be the model
of obedient servitude.

09:20.241 --> 09:22.994
And he will never know how much I think
he's a backstabbing weasel

09:22.994 --> 09:26.830
- who would sell out his own mother to--
- Mel. Mel. Nice face.

09:28.458 --> 09:30.835
Right. Nice face.

09:38.175 --> 09:40.511
<i>Why don't you admit
why you really want on the case?</i>

09:42.389 --> 09:44.932
Pete Fong has to trim
the department budget,

09:45.974 --> 09:49.269
you think you're vulnerable
'cause you're low man on the pole, but...

09:50.813 --> 09:53.775
we both know that's not the reason
why you're vulnerable, is it?

09:54.275 --> 09:56.861
Maybe you actually really
don't wanna put me on the case

09:56.861 --> 09:58.404
because it's stalling

09:58.404 --> 10:01.240
and you know that I would
actually do something with it,

10:01.240 --> 10:02.492
which would make you look bad,

10:02.492 --> 10:04.785
and then it would be
impossible for you to fire me

10:04.785 --> 10:07.539
which is what you really wanna do
if you're being honest, right?

10:07.539 --> 10:09.081
Well, if I'm being honest...

10:11.209 --> 10:13.837
you're kind of impossible
to deal with, Mel.

10:14.754 --> 10:17.548
I mean, case in point,
antagonizing your boss

10:17.548 --> 10:21.468
as you're asking for a favor... again.

10:22.761 --> 10:23.679
Again?

10:24.596 --> 10:30.270
Last year... when I risked my fucking job
by not turning in your psych eval?

10:30.602 --> 10:31.770
- Remember that?
- Manny.

10:32.105 --> 10:35.107
Yeah. Yeah. You asked real nice.

10:35.692 --> 10:38.402
- Without fucking insults.
- Okay. Okay.

10:39.237 --> 10:43.741
I'm sorry. And I get it.
You're right. I appreciate it, okay?

10:44.451 --> 10:47.704
But I don't want to relitigate the past.
I'm talking about my future.

10:48.454 --> 10:52.167
Which is me working
on the Guyana case, okay?

10:52.167 --> 10:53.960
- Not gonna happen, Mel.
- Manny!

10:54.293 --> 10:57.338
- Go back to the Queen's College thing.
- Oh, my God!

10:57.338 --> 10:59.506
You were supposed to turn it in
two weeks ago.

10:59.506 --> 11:01.842
Right. Yes. You're right.

11:02.427 --> 11:06.473
Because that massive criminal organization

11:06.473 --> 11:11.268
led by a dorm kid
mailing fucking fake IDs to high schoolers

11:11.268 --> 11:12.936
is endangering more lives

11:12.936 --> 11:17.733
than actual gangsters murdering bums
and vagrants for insurance premiums.

11:17.733 --> 11:21.403
Oh, I'm sorry. Is the assignment
not sexy enough for you?

11:22.696 --> 11:23.906
Here's a fact.

11:24.866 --> 11:27.409
When you have a job,
you get assignments from your boss.

11:27.827 --> 11:30.497
I'm your boss. You don't do
the fucking assignment...

11:30.497 --> 11:32.331
- Manny.
- ...you get fired.

11:34.376 --> 11:35.668
Don't get fired, Mel.

11:45.303 --> 11:46.388
Damn it.

11:56.355 --> 11:58.900
<i>- Well?
- So, I'm working the Guyana case.</i>

11:59.233 --> 12:02.736
<i>Oh, my God! Well done, you.
So he agreed with you.</i>

12:05.407 --> 12:06.282
No.

12:07.157 --> 12:11.078
So he didn't actually put you on the case?

12:11.078 --> 12:15.374
- No. No. He didn't. No.
- But you said you're gonna work it.

12:15.374 --> 12:17.377
Yeah. On my own time.

12:17.752 --> 12:21.338
<i>- Oh, Mel.
- Yeah.</i>

12:22.757 --> 12:24.091
Next one. Ready?

12:25.885 --> 12:29.847
Here we go. Square up.
That's... not bad. Two hands.

12:29.847 --> 12:31.515
Just watch it all the way to the glove.

12:32.683 --> 12:33.726
Here we go.

12:36.938 --> 12:39.189
Here we go. Get it. Get on your horse!

12:41.024 --> 12:43.152
That was my bad. Good hustle.

12:49.366 --> 12:51.953
What? Seriously?
He lost his phone again?

12:51.953 --> 12:55.081
- You looked everywhere? Behind the dugout?
- Yes, Dad.

12:55.081 --> 12:57.375
- Under the bench?
- I said yes.

12:58.209 --> 12:59.418
It was in my shoes.

13:00.711 --> 13:02.796
Yup. He sure did.

13:04.716 --> 13:07.509
- Really?
- You saw me take them off.

13:07.509 --> 13:11.388
You saw me never go back in the dugout.
I don't know how it happened.

13:12.766 --> 13:13.975
You heard correctly.

13:15.350 --> 13:17.519
Yeah, we'll give him the talk. Part Seven.

14:33.679 --> 14:35.265
- Hey.
- Hey.

14:35.932 --> 14:38.350
How'd it go with the proofs?
Pick a winner?

14:38.892 --> 14:40.686
Well, they're all winners.

14:41.646 --> 14:44.774
So where did we land
with the whole losing stuff thing?

14:45.149 --> 14:47.443
I told him this time there's no new one.

14:47.443 --> 14:49.278
- You heard that, right, bud?
- Yes.

14:49.278 --> 14:51.156
Did you do Find My iPhone?

14:51.156 --> 14:54.408
The phone has to be on to track it.
I'm sure they wiped it anyways.

14:54.826 --> 14:57.745
Are you sure?
'Cause you were sure four months ago

14:57.745 --> 15:00.040
when you lost the watch
that Grandpa Jeff gave you.

15:00.040 --> 15:04.293
Grandpa's watch? You lost it?
W-- How did I not know this?

15:04.918 --> 15:09.049
And the sweatshirt. His favorite one.
The one he waited in line for

15:09.049 --> 15:12.092
then had to spend
four months allowance to replace.

15:12.092 --> 15:14.720
- Where are you going?
- Find My iPhone, again.

15:15.095 --> 15:16.430
Just tell me when dinner's ready.

15:16.430 --> 15:18.348
- I am not finished.
- Derek, just let him--

15:18.348 --> 15:20.769
Moving forward, Jared,
buddy, help us out here.

15:20.769 --> 15:22.144
Huh? What is the plan?

15:22.519 --> 15:24.397
What kind of systems
are we gonna put in place

15:24.397 --> 15:27.357
- so this all stops?
- I don't know.

15:27.357 --> 15:29.818
How about one where
I don't somehow lose everything?

15:45.209 --> 15:48.087
I need two boys. Preferably from GT.

15:49.297 --> 15:51.257
What kind of time frame
are we talking, Ms. M?

15:51.257 --> 15:53.926
- As soon as possible.
- Why Georgetown?

15:53.926 --> 15:56.178
We probably got people here
who can do whatever you want.

15:56.888 --> 16:00.474
No, Garmen. I want people
who will do what we say

16:00.474 --> 16:02.017
and won't ask questions.

16:02.935 --> 16:06.605
Natalia, the masseuse, she have a brother
who got into trouble in GT.

16:07.315 --> 16:10.944
He want to come up with his best friend.
Let's arrange it.

16:38.262 --> 16:39.179
Yo!

16:40.181 --> 16:41.932
- Xavier.
- Louis.

16:41.932 --> 16:45.395
- What's going on? Look, look.
- Now?

16:45.729 --> 16:47.020
Bye, everybody. Bye.

16:50.025 --> 16:51.901
Oh, Louis!

16:53.945 --> 16:55.738
- So, this is really happen?
- Yeah, man.

16:55.738 --> 16:57.030
You get the passport?

16:57.030 --> 16:58.658
So, when we at the forest
across the river...

16:58.658 --> 17:00.534
- Raas.
- ...they will give it to us

17:00.994 --> 17:02.203
then take us to the airport.

17:02.203 --> 17:05.247
Hey, Shakeela. It's me, Xavier.

17:05.582 --> 17:09.085
Me buddy come through. I know, I know.

17:09.502 --> 17:12.171
I don't know.
His sister arrange everything.

17:12.964 --> 17:15.799
Me and you,
we go meet in person, finally.

17:17.092 --> 17:18.260
Ticketing.

17:18.260 --> 17:21.013
You know, I've gotta see this
for a very, very, very long time.

17:21.013 --> 17:22.932
Long time. Long time.

17:29.147 --> 17:30.190
Let's go.

17:35.779 --> 17:41.075
- Kingston to Georgetown, brother.
- Yeah, man. And now New York!

17:41.575 --> 17:43.703
Yeah, yeah, yeah! New York!

17:45.246 --> 17:47.539
- Yeah, man.
- Crazy.

17:58.843 --> 18:03.639
Hey, hey, Shakeela. It's me, Xavier.
I can't wait to see you in person.

18:04.015 --> 18:05.432
We got a little meeting first,

18:05.432 --> 18:10.396
but let me know what time school finish
and text me a place you want meet.

18:15.442 --> 18:16.902
Louis, your sister waiting for you.

18:16.902 --> 18:18.779
She'll take you both straight
to your meeting with Aked.

18:25.327 --> 18:27.913
Little gift to get you started.

18:31.626 --> 18:32.711
Thank you, Mr. Len.

18:33.837 --> 18:37.339
- Thank you, sir.
- Thank Mrs. Mahabir. It's from her.

18:38.340 --> 18:39.675
And I need your passports.

18:44.096 --> 18:45.265
Okay.

18:49.560 --> 18:51.103
Hey, Xav.

18:53.356 --> 18:54.858
Let me be straight with you.

18:56.735 --> 18:59.029
Us coming here wasn't my sister's idea.

19:00.279 --> 19:01.990
You told me she arrange everything.

19:03.365 --> 19:06.327
No. Natalia boss arrange everything.

19:08.078 --> 19:10.540
My sister may not be too happy to see us.

19:11.875 --> 19:13.000
Just warning you.

19:16.463 --> 19:18.255
And you're just telling me this now?

19:23.677 --> 19:24.596
Yeah.

19:33.062 --> 19:37.775
I hear you was running weed, Louis,
which means you lied to me on the phone.

19:38.233 --> 19:39.527
We was just tricked, Nat.

19:39.944 --> 19:42.154
Point was I gonna be
sending you money this time.

19:42.154 --> 19:46.993
Point is, I hope you happy
'cause now you into something different.

19:46.993 --> 19:48.870
Ain't even a hello? Hey!

19:50.622 --> 19:52.414
You'll get one when I'm done being mad.

19:55.793 --> 19:58.837
This Xavier. Friend I tell you about.

20:04.010 --> 20:07.055
- Me auntie friends with your mother.
- I know you.

20:07.055 --> 20:09.306
In our primary school
you stole my kickball.

20:10.809 --> 20:12.684
Probably. I don't know.

20:13.937 --> 20:16.063
Well, Xavier, you got legs.
You can follow too.

20:17.065 --> 20:21.236
Let's go. You coming or not?
Now ain't the time to keep Aked waiting.

20:24.947 --> 20:29.285
The thing about Garmen Harry.
Number one, loyalty.

20:30.495 --> 20:35.374
Number two, loyalty. And number three...

20:37.293 --> 20:39.421
What's number three? What was-- Loyalty.

20:40.879 --> 20:41.839
All right?

20:43.424 --> 20:44.758
Is Garmen the boss?

20:45.843 --> 20:48.178
Garmen "Mr. Harry" to you.

20:49.930 --> 20:52.392
The boss is Mrs. Mahabir.

20:53.810 --> 20:56.979
Or if and only if
she gives you permission, Ms. M.

20:57.563 --> 21:01.984
Full disclosure,
Savitri Mahabir is my aunt.

21:03.862 --> 21:06.864
So, you wanna talk to her? Through me.

21:08.490 --> 21:09.575
Ask Nat.

21:10.660 --> 21:13.996
I don't do this for nobody. Nobody.

21:15.707 --> 21:18.917
But she vouches for you, baby brother.

21:20.295 --> 21:21.211
You...

21:23.214 --> 21:24.257
I don't know about.

21:25.132 --> 21:26.926
But what you say is true
they gonna use you.

21:29.803 --> 21:30.929
How much they pay?

21:32.015 --> 21:35.017
Place to stay, lawyers for a Green Card,

21:36.478 --> 21:38.228
and you must be forgetting
they paid for your travel,

21:38.228 --> 21:39.606
but I'm gonna let that slide.

21:40.522 --> 21:41.441
You work it off.

21:42.525 --> 21:44.652
- Sky the limit.
- How much I work off?

21:46.570 --> 21:49.574
- About 50K per, something like that.
- U.S.?

21:52.118 --> 21:56.623
U.S.? I like this guy. You funny.
Yeah, yeah. U.S. We're here now, baby.

22:00.794 --> 22:04.546
Sometime few weeks from now,
a guy, Paul, is gonna assign you a trial.

22:05.881 --> 22:09.344
Savitri Mahabir, Garmen Harry,

22:10.387 --> 22:13.138
Paul Tranquada, me...

22:15.265 --> 22:16.184
you.

23:09.695 --> 23:10.738
You guys are good?

23:12.614 --> 23:14.200
Yeah? You know what you're doing?

23:16.160 --> 23:17.662
All right. You can't miss him.

23:18.287 --> 23:21.206
He's in a wheelchair.
If he's awake, he's talking.

23:23.292 --> 23:26.128
I hope you boys appreciate
the nature of this opportunity.

23:27.212 --> 23:28.882
- Yes, sir.
- Yeah?

23:30.175 --> 23:31.842
- Thank you, sir.
- Yeah.

23:31.842 --> 23:34.178
- Thank you, Mr. Paul, sir.
- You're welcome.

23:35.304 --> 23:36.555
All right. You guys can go.

24:25.105 --> 24:28.608
No, no, no, no, man.
The plastic is in the atmosphere

24:28.608 --> 24:31.026
'cause the damn astronauts
keep throwing the shit out of window.

24:31.026 --> 24:34.696
I mean, we got plastic in our blood now.
'Cause of NASA.

24:34.696 --> 24:37.032
Yeah, yeah. It's in a book.
I read all the books.

24:37.032 --> 24:40.286
I read 'em all. You see?
The books are the truth.

24:40.286 --> 24:43.539
I know that the only way
you can tell the truth

24:43.539 --> 24:44.916
is to put it in a book.

24:44.916 --> 24:47.127
And everybody else knows that.
You see what I'm saying?

24:47.127 --> 24:49.629
How do you know that?
Because ink cost money.

25:00.390 --> 25:03.518
Fucking wasting my time
around stupid-ass shit.

25:03.518 --> 25:06.396
I'm a book reader. I read books.
That's what I do.

25:07.939 --> 25:09.524
They mad at me because I know stuff.

25:15.028 --> 25:16.864
Hey, brother, we get something for you.

25:16.864 --> 25:20.118
Yo, what the fuck?
Yo, who are you, man?

25:20.118 --> 25:21.326
Quiet down, man.

25:21.326 --> 25:23.162
Yo, what you doing?
No, no. I'm good. I'm good.

25:23.162 --> 25:25.623
- Relax yourself.
- You can stop here. I'm good.

25:25.623 --> 25:27.040
I just get a little present
for you.

25:27.040 --> 25:28.417
Yo, who are you with, man?

25:28.417 --> 25:29.753
- Are you with Paul?
- Just a friend. All right?

25:29.753 --> 25:31.629
- No, no, no. I'm asking. Wait.
- Keep your voice down.

25:31.629 --> 25:33.088
- What are you doing, man?
- Shut your mouth.

25:33.088 --> 25:34.758
What are you-- No, stop.
How you-- No, no, no.

25:34.758 --> 25:36.634
No, no. No, no.
I don't want nothing. I'm clean.

25:36.634 --> 25:38.552
- It's gonna be all right.
- No, I swear. I'm good, man.

25:38.552 --> 25:40.513
I'm good. No, I'm sorry.

25:41.222 --> 25:42.931
Come on, please. No. What are you doing?

25:42.931 --> 25:45.477
- Come on! Move! Help me, man.
- No, no, please. Stop.

25:45.477 --> 25:48.104
- Help, man!
- Hey, man. Help me, man.

25:48.605 --> 25:52.275
- Come on.
- Quiet, man. Relax yourself.

25:52.608 --> 25:54.443
Quiet yourself. Sorry.

26:02.576 --> 26:05.120
Move! Move now, man.

26:08.708 --> 26:11.461
Natalia. Did you know they would do that?

26:12.504 --> 26:13.462
You did know?

26:14.172 --> 26:16.548
<i>They might make it look like an accident.
But it ain't no accident.</i>

26:18.009 --> 26:20.260
He raas dead now, Nat. That scunt.

26:21.845 --> 26:23.807
I've been trying to get out, Louis.

26:23.807 --> 26:25.974
- Shit.
- I been trying.

26:25.974 --> 26:27.227
Oh, shit.

26:28.144 --> 26:30.437
I'm at massage school two nights a week.

26:31.438 --> 26:34.984
I got janitorial at the massage school
five nights a week.

26:36.069 --> 26:39.279
I got Ms. Mahabir during the day,
so I can pay her off.

26:43.492 --> 26:44.661
Almost done too.

26:47.830 --> 26:52.042
Every time one of them dead,
Natalia, you are part of it.

26:58.758 --> 27:01.553
<i>The new boys were the ones
that pull it off with Neilsen?</i>

27:02.469 --> 27:05.015
<i>The two of them.
One better than the other,</i>

27:05.015 --> 27:09.476
but with Neilsen's drug history,
they could pass this one through fast.

27:09.476 --> 27:11.812
We anticipating a payout
for the full policy.

27:11.812 --> 27:13.689
Three hundred and twenty-five
thousand dollars.

27:14.690 --> 27:18.319
- That's good. Well done.
- But that not come until next year.

27:18.319 --> 27:20.195
We got some bigger issues this year,

27:20.195 --> 27:25.326
especially when I trying to reconcile
the financial mess Quincy left us in

27:25.326 --> 27:26.828
- after he died--
- Look, Garmen. Garmen.

27:27.244 --> 27:28.371
Let's focus forward.

27:30.330 --> 27:34.585
You mean, for this next thing you get?
Whatever it is.

27:34.919 --> 27:36.920
- Coming down the pike.
- That one. Yes.

27:38.464 --> 27:41.341
Well, how am I gonna know
unless you tell me what that thing is.

27:42.010 --> 27:44.054
It's the most important thing
we've ever done.

27:44.762 --> 27:46.055
It involves a boy.

27:46.764 --> 27:52.061
But I don't want to say no more
because me nah wan blight de ting.

27:52.437 --> 27:54.439
So, you're scared me will jinx it
and give you a bad eye,

27:54.439 --> 27:57.108
but I can't run it
unless you tell me what it is.

27:57.108 --> 27:58.776
You're not gonna run it. Aked is.

28:00.152 --> 28:01.195
Ma'am.

28:02.113 --> 28:03.989
You say it's the most important thing.

28:04.490 --> 28:06.743
It's also the most dangerous.

28:06.743 --> 28:11.373
And this way you can supervise,
stay safe and help Aked.

28:12.165 --> 28:13.415
Try not to kill himself.

28:14.292 --> 28:17.629
<i>Natalia, I told you this was gonna be big.
This is huge. So, what's your problem?</i>

28:17.629 --> 28:21.383
Why is kidnapping some pickney
gonna make up for what happened to Quincy?

28:21.925 --> 28:23.592
- Reasons.
- Reasons?

28:23.592 --> 28:25.427
- Yes. Reasons.
- Aked.

28:25.427 --> 28:26.678
From the boss.

28:28.013 --> 28:30.307
Who's grieving right now. You know that.

28:31.976 --> 28:33.645
Look, my auntie left me in charge.

28:33.977 --> 28:36.563
All right? Me in charge of all this.
You understand?

28:37.982 --> 28:39.483
Version six.

28:41.111 --> 28:42.237
I like this one.

28:43.654 --> 28:48.159
Leave notes. Okay? So, you know, like,

28:49.159 --> 28:52.414
Chef Jeff or whoever,
the kid's father, whatever.

28:52.414 --> 28:55.542
They pull up to the library,
boom, next place.

28:56.417 --> 28:58.628
Subway station.
I don't know. I'm making it up.

28:59.337 --> 29:01.338
Boom. They get to the library,
open up an envelope.

29:01.338 --> 29:03.800
"Congratulations,
you made it to the library."

29:03.800 --> 29:08.178
"Now, you got to book it to the bridge."

29:10.640 --> 29:11.683
Gonna keep it clever.

29:26.613 --> 29:30.201
So yeah. Yeah, Shakeela. It's me, Xavier.

29:30.910 --> 29:33.662
So yeah, I was thinking
maybe we could do that again.

29:35.415 --> 29:36.875
Maybe nighttime this time.

29:38.543 --> 29:40.252
Or, you know, maybe even tonight?

29:41.629 --> 29:45.592
I just going for a walk now,
so if you done all your homework

29:46.259 --> 29:48.178
and you feel like catching
a vibe just,

29:49.303 --> 29:50.555
yeah, just give me a call.

29:51.346 --> 29:52.349
But...

29:53.558 --> 29:54.767
Yeah, I'ma call you right back.

29:57.020 --> 29:58.479
You didn't happen to be in the alley

29:58.479 --> 30:00.481
behind Gemini's Lounge the other night,
did you?

30:03.150 --> 30:08.614
Is... this familiar to you?
You know, dead body, wheelchair.

30:09.364 --> 30:10.741
We brought the sheet.

30:11.200 --> 30:12.785
- No idea.
- Oh, you know, I wonder

30:12.785 --> 30:16.331
if I described the alley to you,
if it will jog your memory.

30:16.331 --> 30:21.252
So, we have Gemini's Lounge,
next to the laundromat,

30:21.753 --> 30:25.255
next to the pawn shop,
which, like all pawn shops,

30:25.255 --> 30:29.886
has a security camera, which as you know,
have gotten very good these days.

30:31.762 --> 30:35.474
- Let me see that.
- I-- Sorry. It's government property.

30:35.933 --> 30:39.020
However, my name is on this.

30:40.104 --> 30:43.232
And whenever you're ready
to give me yours, give me a call?

30:54.284 --> 30:58.914
<i>It will happen in Washington Square Park
at 1:11 a.m., inside a circle.</i>

30:59.290 --> 31:00.791
We will be in the park

31:00.791 --> 31:03.503
to make sure
there is no deviation from the plan.

31:04.254 --> 31:08.298
He will feel the same pain I felt
when I lost my grandson.

31:09.008 --> 31:11.135
A boy for a boy.

31:13.680 --> 31:17.433
And the balance will be restored
and all will be good.

31:17.933 --> 31:18.934
It will.

31:19.977 --> 31:22.688
Well, I want to hear
from Mr. Joseph directly.

31:23.731 --> 31:25.608
Everything will be good.

31:28.402 --> 31:30.321
Excellent, excellent.
Thank you, gentleman.

31:30.321 --> 31:34.658
- Thank you. It was an honor, madam.
- The honor was all mine. I assure you.

31:34.658 --> 31:36.870
We'll see you tomorrow night
at the celebration.

31:36.870 --> 31:39.164
Yes. Tomorrow we shall celebrate.

31:39.164 --> 31:42.000
- I'll be right there, Natalia.
- Yes, Ms. Mahabir.

31:42.000 --> 31:43.542
Natalia, is everything all right?

31:45.335 --> 31:46.920
Yes, Ms. Mahabir.

32:08.443 --> 32:10.110
- Good night, sir.
- Good night.

32:13.365 --> 32:16.743
Xavier, I need you to go
to Washington Square Park,

32:16.743 --> 32:22.331
Lower Manhattan. You can Google it.
Ms. Mahabir asking for...

32:26.794 --> 32:32.050
Apparently, there are...
circles in the park in different places.

32:32.050 --> 32:35.470
She want to know the various sizes,
where, how many...

32:37.347 --> 32:40.392
Yeah. My advice to you, Xavier,
watch your ass on this one.

32:42.018 --> 32:43.185
Good night, sir.

33:04.499 --> 33:05.500
Okay.

33:07.335 --> 33:12.757
I just don't feel like four people talking
in a room for two hours is a movie.

33:13.508 --> 33:16.136
Okay. I just thought you'd be mad

33:16.136 --> 33:18.304
that I brought you to a movie
where you had to read.

33:18.304 --> 33:19.888
Yeah, I mean, that didn't help.

33:22.307 --> 33:23.559
Oh, shit. Hold on.

33:25.854 --> 33:28.440
Inspector Harmony speaking.
Who might this be?

33:29.606 --> 33:30.775
My name is Xavier.

33:31.442 --> 33:34.612
If I give you information,
can you get me home?

33:35.028 --> 33:37.741
Home, home, home? Like Guyana?

33:38.407 --> 33:40.743
<i>- Yes.
- No.</i>

33:41.118 --> 33:43.454
But I can try to make your life easier

33:43.454 --> 33:45.748
<i>in direct proportion
to the information given.</i>

33:46.374 --> 33:49.084
Divided by, of course,
how seriously you've already

33:49.084 --> 33:50.210
fucked your life.

33:50.587 --> 33:52.588
<i>Something is going down
tomorrow night.</i>

33:52.922 --> 33:56.175
<i>Well, that's a good first step.
Second step, where is it happening?</i>

33:56.759 --> 33:58.345
Washington Square Park.

33:59.679 --> 34:02.891
It's four in the morning.
Why are you waking me up?

34:03.350 --> 34:04.725
They gonna kill that boy.

34:05.935 --> 34:08.772
The one they kidnapping.
I heard Mrs. Mahabir say it.

34:09.397 --> 34:11.023
No matter what happen,
she want to kill him.

34:12.525 --> 34:13.442
Why?

34:14.735 --> 34:18.198
She think it some kind of answer
to all the bad that's been happening.

34:19.114 --> 34:22.410
- How that make sense?
- She crazy, is how.

34:23.786 --> 34:26.663
All of sudden, nothing she do makes sense.

34:28.207 --> 34:30.960
She bring these people here
from Guyana last week

34:30.960 --> 34:32.169
and got a whole plan.

34:33.296 --> 34:36.090
And he picked Xavier for the plan,
but I just told him you'd be good too

34:36.090 --> 34:38.259
- because he may need one more person--
- You put me up for that?

34:38.259 --> 34:40.136
- Quiet! Quiet.
- You all upset about it then you put me

34:40.136 --> 34:41.762
- up for it? This is exactly what...
- Louis. I got a plan.

34:41.762 --> 34:43.138
- ...I don't want to do.
- Louis!

34:43.931 --> 34:45.724
You ain't gonna kidnap the boy.

34:46.893 --> 34:48.060
You're gonna save him.

34:49.437 --> 34:50.437
We gonna.

34:51.564 --> 34:52.523
What?

34:53.774 --> 34:55.901
- Why?
- Because you said it...

34:57.362 --> 34:59.780
If someone dead, I'm a part of it.

35:00.990 --> 35:02.826
I'm trying to do the right thing.

35:03.868 --> 35:07.121
- And you should be too.
- Natalia. Natalia!

35:09.456 --> 35:10.749
The thing that's happening...

35:12.210 --> 35:13.253
when that gonna happen?

35:14.045 --> 35:16.713
Aked was worried if he put
a crew together too soon,

35:16.713 --> 35:18.383
they'd talk so we just know
telling Xavier--

35:18.383 --> 35:19.968
Natalia. When this a happening?

35:23.804 --> 35:24.805
Tonight.

35:27.058 --> 35:28.142
Muddaskunt.

35:29.017 --> 35:31.562
Tonight? And you're just
telling me this now?

35:31.896 --> 35:34.024
I had to wait 'till Aked fell asleep.

35:35.025 --> 35:37.027
I don't know how we gonna do all of it.

35:37.652 --> 35:39.486
I don't know how we gonna do most of it.

35:41.029 --> 35:43.491
But I know how we at least can start.

36:17.817 --> 36:19.861
I'm texting you
where to go to get the bike.

36:20.403 --> 36:23.697
It's got to be the exact laundry bike
that Aked is using.

36:23.697 --> 36:25.533
You see the photo here. Okay?

36:28.035 --> 36:31.915
And I need you to get this black bag.

36:32.332 --> 36:37.294
I'm texting it now to you. Okay?
And get a wig. Any type of wig.

36:37.294 --> 36:42.342
Okay. Now, I'm sending you a address
I need you to leave the bike.

36:42.342 --> 36:44.969
I go get it after work,
I go put the dummy inside.

36:44.969 --> 36:49.890
All right? I need you to text me
when you get close to the park. All right?

37:14.456 --> 37:16.209
So, which one of my plans we going with?

37:16.209 --> 37:18.169
The one where you wait for us
to tell you what to do.

37:19.503 --> 37:21.046
- When is that?
- When we tell you.

37:29.430 --> 37:33.058
<i>They've gotten super controlling.
They won't even let me lock my phone.</i>

37:34.101 --> 37:36.687
They're trying to prove a point
about me being responsible.

37:37.187 --> 37:39.524
Plus, I can't go out anyway.
I've got tutor.

37:39.898 --> 37:41.693
What if I promise it'll be worth it?

37:42.193 --> 37:46.196
<i>Like... I can tell you
what happened to your stuff.</i>

37:48.657 --> 37:50.242
It's a business transaction.

37:50.868 --> 37:54.496
I'll tell you more about it
in the van. Okay? Come on.

37:54.496 --> 37:57.040
How is grabbing a little boy
a business transaction?

37:59.002 --> 38:00.962
I said I'd tell you more
about it in the van.

38:05.300 --> 38:06.343
You good, Louis?

38:07.761 --> 38:11.263
What's good with you?
Your sister said you could handle this.

38:11.722 --> 38:12.974
I got to set her straight?

38:14.184 --> 38:15.185
So come on.

38:19.189 --> 38:20.147
Keesen!

38:21.358 --> 38:23.275
Let's go. Come on.

38:27.988 --> 38:30.407
Me will come just now.
Let me grab something.

38:45.423 --> 38:46.548
So, what do you got?

38:48.634 --> 38:50.679
Yeah, so Agent Lady, I was wrong.

38:51.303 --> 38:53.098
Ain't nothing happening tonight.
I was wrong.

38:53.472 --> 38:55.141
<i>What do you mean
nothing's happening?</i>

38:55.141 --> 38:57.643
I messed up and I'm sorry.
And I can't do this.

38:57.643 --> 38:58.853
What? Xavier, no, you can't just

38:58.853 --> 39:00.563
<i>- back out like this.
- I'm sorry. Agent Harmony--</i>

39:00.563 --> 39:01.772
<i>- Xavier, you cannot--
- Hey!</i>

39:08.321 --> 39:09.280
You ready?

39:10.490 --> 39:11.491
Me good.

39:14.411 --> 39:15.537
Was that your guy?

39:16.829 --> 39:18.206
Yeah. It was Xavier.

39:20.333 --> 39:21.876
He said that Washington Square Park

39:21.876 --> 39:24.379
isn't happening tonight,
but it obviously is.

39:27.423 --> 39:30.218
Just... give me a sec.

39:30.218 --> 39:31.219
Yeah.

39:36.640 --> 39:37.641
Hey, Manny...

39:39.226 --> 39:40.978
Listen, I know
you're with your daughter tonight,

39:40.978 --> 39:43.021
so I hope you even get this.

39:44.064 --> 39:46.818
I also hope you actually think

39:46.818 --> 39:51.238
that this is good news,
but I did go a little rogue.

39:51.780 --> 39:54.075
And it was on my own time,
so don't worry,

39:54.075 --> 39:59.705
but I actually did manage to turn
a cooperator... ish.

40:00.498 --> 40:03.585
And that he said that
there was something happening

40:03.585 --> 40:07.756
in Washington Square Park tonight.
But then he said there isn't.

40:08.547 --> 40:10.425
Which makes me think that there is.

40:10.425 --> 40:13.218
And that it's bigger
than the whack-a-bum stuff

40:13.218 --> 40:15.430
because why would they be
killing a vagrant

40:15.430 --> 40:16.639
in Washington Square Park.

40:16.639 --> 40:19.016
So, I feel like
I should definitely be there,

40:19.016 --> 40:21.186
but I don't want to go
until I hear back from you

40:21.186 --> 40:25.189
because I am trying to be professional

40:25.189 --> 40:30.153
and to respect protocol. So, yeah,

40:30.153 --> 40:35.450
when you get this, just hit me back
and yeah, I'll be sitting tight.

40:35.450 --> 40:36.617
Okay. Bye.

40:38.536 --> 40:41.998
So, are you gonna wait for his approval

40:41.998 --> 40:45.210
- or...
- Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

40:45.752 --> 40:46.668
Right.

40:57.554 --> 40:58.723
Hey, Jared?

41:03.520 --> 41:05.896
- Jared?
- Yeah.

41:06.397 --> 41:08.982
The microwave's jammed.
The door won't open.

41:09.818 --> 41:15.031
The microwave. Yeah.
Yeah. It's not jammed. It's a drawer now.

41:15.031 --> 41:19.536
- It's a drawer?
- Yeah. You know, it's this whole thing.

41:20.953 --> 41:21.954
There's a button.

41:23.163 --> 41:24.249
Oh, my God.

41:25.082 --> 41:28.168
Since your parents remodeled,
I can't figure out a damn thing

41:28.168 --> 41:29.711
in this place.
Are you sure you're not hungry?

41:30.213 --> 41:33.507
No. I'm not feeling too good.
I'm just gonna crash tonight.

41:34.425 --> 41:35.551
Well, don't you have tutor?

41:36.803 --> 41:38.637
I think I'm just gonna cancel.

41:38.637 --> 41:41.141
If I'm sick,
I don't want to get Sarah sick.

41:41.141 --> 41:44.309
- So... yeah.
- Did you call her?

41:46.229 --> 41:50.274
I actually lost my phone.
Do you think you could call her for me?

41:50.691 --> 41:53.318
Mom left her number on the sheet
next to the phone.

41:54.361 --> 41:57.282
You do look a little flushed.
Okay, sweetie, I will.

41:57.990 --> 41:59.784
- Thanks, Nanna.
- Can I get you some soup?

42:00.243 --> 42:02.119
No, I'm just gonna go to bed.

42:02.119 --> 42:03.704
- I'm not really hungry.
- All right.

42:03.704 --> 42:05.748
- Well, hope you feel better.
- Yeah.

42:05.748 --> 42:07.751
Oh, sweetheart. Love you.

42:08.084 --> 42:10.754
- Love you too. Good night, Nanna.
- Good night.

42:51.294 --> 42:52.252
Do you see her right there?

42:53.922 --> 42:55.173
That's the tutor girl.

42:56.298 --> 42:58.383
She gonna come,
she gonna post up on the building,

42:58.718 --> 42:59.636
check her phone.

43:00.845 --> 43:02.513
It's maybe Instagram or something.
I don't know.

43:03.515 --> 43:05.766
But she waits,
she might call him. Hold on.

43:07.226 --> 43:08.520
She ready, then they gonna go

43:08.520 --> 43:10.354
across the park right now
and go to the Bean.

43:11.021 --> 43:12.357
Do some school shit.

43:13.148 --> 43:15.485
As soon she leaves with him,
that's when we go, okay?

43:20.657 --> 43:21.700
What the fuck?

43:22.784 --> 43:23.992
What the fuck!

43:24.661 --> 43:27.497
Yo, I told Len to track him
the last two fucking Saturdays.

43:28.331 --> 43:29.499
Wait, I got a backup.

43:30.374 --> 43:32.459
I got these FedEx joints, maybe we go,

43:32.459 --> 43:34.087
- we knock on the door--
- Hey, Aked.

43:34.087 --> 43:35.797
That him? Right there, that door?

43:39.259 --> 43:40.301
Yeah, that's him.

43:40.759 --> 43:43.721
That's him. Where is he going?
Where is this motherfucker going? What?

43:44.304 --> 43:45.889
That's a one-way.
He just went up a one-way.

43:45.889 --> 43:49.143
Fuck. Go up next block.
Next block. Make a right.

43:59.486 --> 44:00.739
I don't see shit.

44:00.739 --> 44:03.283
Thought you said
this man was already there, chief?

44:03.283 --> 44:04.534
No. I know. I know.

44:06.494 --> 44:09.329
Okay, this right, right here. You take
this right, right here. Right here.

44:24.511 --> 44:26.680
I just can't take anything
he says seriously.

44:26.680 --> 44:31.268
All I can do is picture him
sitting in that chair with tin foil on.

44:32.269 --> 44:34.813
That's not fair. Not everyone can rock

44:34.813 --> 44:36.940
- the silver fox like you.
- Oh, God bless you,

44:36.940 --> 44:39.026
- but you know what I mean.
- Hi, Mom.

44:40.945 --> 44:42.447
Hey, thanks for the heads up.

44:42.447 --> 44:44.823
Yeah. Well, I hope you don't mind
the executive decision.

44:44.823 --> 44:48.869
Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, I mean,
no sense doing tutor if he's sick.

44:50.330 --> 44:52.832
- Night.
- Night, night.

44:54.501 --> 44:56.210
- Good night, Kris.
- Good night, Derek.

45:14.145 --> 45:16.605
I think he just didn't wanna do tutor.

45:35.916 --> 45:37.876
All right. Fuck it.
Take this left right here.

45:38.961 --> 45:40.045
Right here. Right here.

45:40.045 --> 45:41.339
- Right here?
- Yeah.

45:47.220 --> 45:48.096
Nothing?

45:59.898 --> 46:01.651
Fuck it. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.

46:01.651 --> 46:04.528
Wait, wait, wait. There's he.
There's he. Right there!

46:07.197 --> 46:12.203
Yeah. Yes! Yeah, Keesen!

46:12.203 --> 46:13.912
- Go, go, go, Xavier. Hurry, hurry, hurry!
- Hurry!

47:20.980 --> 47:23.566
Hi. Thank you.
You must have my son's phone.

47:23.566 --> 47:26.653
- He's always losing his stuff.
- Actually, we have your son.

47:27.195 --> 47:28.863
- What?
- I said we have your son.

47:28.863 --> 47:30.656
<i>And we'll kill him
if you don't do what we say.</i>

47:30.656 --> 47:32.199
- Hang on. Hang on. Hang on.
- All right? Yo, lady,

47:32.199 --> 47:33.493
<i>- you're not in charge here.
- No, I said hang on!</i>

47:33.493 --> 47:34.452
You need to stop talkin

47:34.452 --> 47:35.537
<i>- and start listening...
- Sam?</i>

47:35.537 --> 47:37.830
<i>...or this will be the worst night
of your life. You hear me?</i>

47:37.830 --> 47:38.914
What's going on?

47:38.914 --> 47:40.291
- They have Jared.
- What?

47:40.291 --> 47:42.126
<i>Damn right, we do.
And here what's gonna happen--</i>

47:42.126 --> 47:45.212
Whoa, whoa, whoa. If this is a joke,
it's not funny. Who's talking?

47:45.212 --> 47:48.257
<i>Now, I'm gonna give you a figure,
and I suggest you write it down.</i>

47:48.257 --> 47:50.342
Do you have Jared?
I want to talk to Jared.

47:50.342 --> 47:53.512
Who is this?
Who is talking to me right now?

47:53.512 --> 47:56.557
<i>Three hundred and fourteen thousand,
one hundred and fifty-nine.</i>

47:57.559 --> 48:00.020
- Wait, wait, wait. Just... wait.
- Write that number down. It's important.

48:00.020 --> 48:01.521
- What are these numbers?
- One, four, one...

48:01.521 --> 48:02.855
- This-- This is money?
- Derek!

48:02.855 --> 48:06.984
No, you need to tell us something.
Give us some information.

48:07.485 --> 48:10.237
White sneakers, there's writing on them.

48:11.864 --> 48:13.658
Yellow and green Trek mountain bike.

48:14.659 --> 48:16.244
You're gonna get a call shortly

48:16.244 --> 48:18.495
explaining where you pick up the money.
All right?

48:20.122 --> 48:23.418
Yes, cash.
Nothing bigger than twenties, you hear me?

48:25.545 --> 48:28.422
Man, I don't know. Why don't you ask
your fucking father-in-law

48:28.422 --> 48:30.549
what his Atlantic City
credit limit is. All right?

48:40.476 --> 48:42.061
Sure, about that move, Clarence?

48:43.229 --> 48:44.563
You might want to rethink that.

48:54.824 --> 48:56.700
Again. Sorry. Sorry.

48:57.494 --> 48:58.536
Of course.

48:58.870 --> 49:01.371
Sam, I am playing chess with my friend--

49:01.955 --> 49:04.250
Just-- Sam. Slow down.

49:05.251 --> 49:06.878
Slow down. Slow down!

49:09.671 --> 49:10.589
What?

49:11.840 --> 49:12.800
What!

49:15.553 --> 49:17.347
I'm sorry. I...

49:18.390 --> 49:19.349
I've got to go.

49:20.599 --> 49:21.767
I'll... I'll...

49:27.774 --> 49:30.235
Just tell him it's an emergency.

49:30.902 --> 49:33.695
I need to borrow against my credit limit.

49:34.906 --> 49:36.533
Because I can't right now, Joey!

49:36.533 --> 49:39.952
- Did she tell you anything?
- I know about as much as you do.

49:39.952 --> 49:43.997
Look, just call Sey.
If he's not on the casino floor

49:43.997 --> 49:45.582
then he's gonna be awake somewhere.

49:45.582 --> 49:47.167
Chef Jeff, Ms. McCusker,
you forgot to sign--

49:47.167 --> 49:49.753
Not now, Bryce. Yes. Just do it.

49:51.255 --> 49:52.215
Call me back.

49:59.138 --> 50:01.099
- My God. Oh, my God.
- Sam. Anybody called?

50:01.099 --> 50:02.142
Derek?

50:02.600 --> 50:04.393
Joey called my guy in Atlantic City.

50:04.393 --> 50:05.561
They haven't told us a thing.

50:05.561 --> 50:08.440
- You know, I'm sorry you're involved.
- What are you apologizing for?

50:08.440 --> 50:11.150
Did you fucking do it? Don't apologize.

50:11.150 --> 50:13.486
- Wait, Joey?
- Wait, Dad! He said no police.

50:13.486 --> 50:15.779
- Joey's not police. He's not anymore.
- I checked and he was there.

50:15.779 --> 50:17.198
- Honest to God!
- He's the best there is.

50:17.198 --> 50:18.490
- I checked and he was there.
- Kris!

50:18.490 --> 50:19.616
- Yes?
- This is not about you.

50:19.616 --> 50:21.369
- I know that, but I--
- Can we just take a beat?

50:21.369 --> 50:23.203
- I looked in his room and he was there...
- We don't have a fucking beat.

50:23.203 --> 50:24.288
- This is a nightmare.
- Kris?

50:24.288 --> 50:25.706
- Kris.
- I would never... What?

50:25.706 --> 50:27.875
- Kristen, it's not you.
- Yeah. I know.

50:27.875 --> 50:29.711
- We're not mad at you.
- No, no, no, no, no, no.

50:29.711 --> 50:31.880
- Mom! Mom!
- I'm fine. I'm fine.

50:32.338 --> 50:33.882
Hey. Hey, hey.

50:34.257 --> 50:35.632
Oh, my God.

50:35.967 --> 50:40.722
I... I... can't. Okay, wait.

50:40.722 --> 50:43.350
So, what? Police. Yes, or no?

50:43.350 --> 50:46.895
Joey says...
not until Jared's safe at home.

50:48.604 --> 50:52.525
And who the fuck knows
about my casino credit limit?

50:53.942 --> 50:55.153
Fuck.

51:01.158 --> 51:03.911
- Yes?
- Okay, listen to me.

51:04.369 --> 51:06.538
<i>There's a parking lot
right next to the south entrance</i>

51:06.538 --> 51:08.499
<i>of the George Washington Bridge.
All right?</i>

51:08.917 --> 51:11.461
<i>Tell your boys at the casino
to drop your cash there.</i>

51:11.795 --> 51:13.337
When you're on the bridge with the money,

51:13.337 --> 51:15.465
<i>you'll receive your next instruction,
all right?</i>

51:16.340 --> 51:17.883
Look, if you're not there by midnight,

51:17.883 --> 51:20.594
<i>if you're not alone
or police have been called,</i>

51:20.594 --> 51:21.970
your son will be killed.

51:22.472 --> 51:25.016
Okay, put our son
on the phone, please. Put--

51:28.061 --> 51:29.145
Fuck.

51:31.731 --> 51:34.066
- Jared!
- What the fuck?

51:34.066 --> 51:37.611
Jared? Oh, my God. Where have you been?

51:37.611 --> 51:39.572
Jeez, Mom, I just went out for a walk.

51:39.572 --> 51:41.199
- Calm down. What--
- Sweetheart.

51:41.199 --> 51:43.909
- You lied to your grandmother.
- Derek, he's here.

51:43.909 --> 51:45.870
- Derek, it's fine.
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

51:45.870 --> 51:48.122
He was sneaking.
He lied to your mom and us.

51:48.122 --> 51:49.332
I didn't realize how late it was.

51:49.332 --> 51:50.625
- I'm sorry.
- I'm so glad. I just--

51:50.625 --> 51:53.293
- Please. Please just be honest with us.
- Stop. Fucking calm down.

51:53.293 --> 51:56.505
Okay? Were you meeting someone?
A boy? A girl? It doesn't matter.

51:56.505 --> 51:58.632
- Just talk to us. Please.
- This is not the time

51:58.632 --> 52:00.385
to be fucking around, son.

52:01.260 --> 52:03.387
This is not the time to be fucking around.

52:05.347 --> 52:07.142
- This is no time to fuck around.
- No, Dad, no.

52:07.142 --> 52:08.768
Hold on. Just hold on.

52:11.479 --> 52:14.773
Hey, you need to talk to us, bud.
What's going on?

52:14.773 --> 52:17.694
Okay, you're not in trouble,
but this is important.

52:18.819 --> 52:19.821
Jared.

52:26.618 --> 52:28.412
There's this boy I've been talking to.

52:29.581 --> 52:31.249
He said he had all my stuff.

52:31.708 --> 52:33.752
And he'd show it to me
if I went to go see him.

52:33.752 --> 52:36.838
So, I lied to Nanna and I snuck out.

52:39.673 --> 52:41.468
<i>When I got there
he was wearing my hoodie.</i>

52:41.468 --> 52:45.722
<i>My original one from before I replaced it.
And he had my shoes too.</i>

52:46.430 --> 52:49.934
<i>He really liked my bike,
so I let him ride it around a little bit.</i>

52:52.394 --> 52:55.690
<i>But then a van came, these guys jumped out
and they threw him in.</i>

52:55.690 --> 52:57.441
And I couldn't do anything about it.

53:00.194 --> 53:02.989
I just got my bike and I rode around

53:02.989 --> 53:05.407
<i>until I could work up the nerve
to come back home.</i>

53:06.159 --> 53:07.202
Oh, baby.

53:08.286 --> 53:10.830
Oh, my God.
That had to have been horrible.

53:12.498 --> 53:15.043
- I think they were after me.
- Why would you think that?

53:15.585 --> 53:18.337
Well, if it had been two minutes earlier,
they would have gotten me.

53:18.837 --> 53:19.880
Oh, baby.

53:21.716 --> 53:23.218
Why would somebody be after me?

53:24.176 --> 53:26.388
- We don't know.
- We don't know anything, bud.

53:28.056 --> 53:30.432
What do you know about this boy?
What's his name?

53:31.392 --> 53:35.020
His name is Nicky.
Look, is he gonna be okay?

53:35.020 --> 53:38.817
Open it. Open it.
Open it right now. Open it.

53:39.191 --> 53:42.070
Yeah. Come here.
Come here. Come here. Look at me.

53:42.070 --> 53:43.821
Look at me. You know how to take pills?

53:43.821 --> 53:46.282
Did boss send you old man
gummy bear sleeping pills?

53:46.282 --> 53:47.826
Shut the fuck up. I'm not talking to you.

53:47.826 --> 53:49.452
Jared, do you know how to take pills?

53:49.452 --> 53:52.414
Don't fuck with me. Look at these.
You know how to take these? Huh?

53:53.705 --> 53:56.251
Okay. Okay. Okay, Ruby. Here we go.

53:57.252 --> 53:59.503
You're okay. You're good. Okay.

54:01.130 --> 54:03.466
- Hey, Joey.
- Sam. Hello.

54:05.135 --> 54:08.263
Hey, so the casino asked
why so much cash so quickly--

54:08.263 --> 54:12.767
- So, you can cancel all that.
- He's here. Jared. He's in his room.

54:13.852 --> 54:15.728
- Hey, Joey.
- How you doing, Mr. Browne?

54:16.645 --> 54:19.649
He's... Jared's here?

54:21.400 --> 54:23.986
- Well, that's good. Right?
- Oh, yeah.

54:29.199 --> 54:30.994
Well, the place looks good. Wow.

54:31.910 --> 54:33.079
Don't even recognize it.

54:35.123 --> 54:36.916
What? What?

54:41.253 --> 54:42.505
- Who is this?
- Derek.

54:42.505 --> 54:44.423
Please. Who am I talking to?

54:45.091 --> 54:47.260
Daddy? Dad?

54:48.386 --> 54:51.389
- Who is this?
- Is there a problem?

54:52.557 --> 54:55.851
No, sir. There's no problem.
We just need to gather some information.

54:56.310 --> 54:59.314
Gather some information?
What the fuck are you talking about?

54:59.314 --> 55:01.607
Gather some--
What the fuck are you talking--

55:02.484 --> 55:03.485
Hello?

55:05.194 --> 55:06.278
They're muting me?

55:10.365 --> 55:11.366
Bolt cutters.

55:11.701 --> 55:13.203
- Huh?
- Give me the bolt cutters.

55:13.535 --> 55:14.954
Give me the fucking bolt cutters.

55:14.954 --> 55:18.248
Come here. Xavier, pull over.
Pull the fuck over.

55:18.625 --> 55:20.085
Aked, what are you doing, buddy?

55:20.085 --> 55:22.503
Record this right now. Hurry. Hurry.

55:24.088 --> 55:27.342
No. I do not negotiate with a terrorist.

55:27.342 --> 55:29.259
- Jeff, come on. They have someone's child.
- Okay, okay.

55:29.259 --> 55:31.554
- So now, we call the police. Right?
- I don't know.

55:31.554 --> 55:32.888
Do we call the police, Joey?

55:34.140 --> 55:38.018
- Wait, is that them?
- Yeah. There's a video attached.

55:39.228 --> 55:40.270
Play it.

55:44.358 --> 55:46.527
- Oh, Holy Christ.
- Oh, my God!

55:47.528 --> 55:49.906
<i>Hold still.
You're making it worse, Jared.</i>

55:51.031 --> 55:52.909
Oh, Jesus Christ.

55:53.326 --> 55:54.536
Oh, my God!

55:55.995 --> 55:58.623
They think... they think they have Jared.

55:58.623 --> 56:00.750
- But they don't.
- Yeah, but if they find out they don't,

56:00.750 --> 56:02.711
what's to keep them from coming after him?

56:02.711 --> 56:03.920
Well, what do we do?

56:04.421 --> 56:07.632
Do we just pretend
that it's Jared or what?

56:13.138 --> 56:14.096
Hello?

56:16.307 --> 56:20.269
It hurts. Please do what they say.

56:22.896 --> 56:24.858
We just need a few more details.

56:26.276 --> 56:29.529
Jared, I want you to talk about yourself.

56:30.112 --> 56:32.490
Call... Charisse.

56:37.245 --> 56:40.999
<i>We'll talk at midnight.
If you're on a bridge and if you're alone.</i>

56:42.207 --> 56:43.960
Wait. What-- what do you mean "alone?"

56:44.669 --> 56:47.337
One person. No cops.

56:49.174 --> 56:51.801
<i>And if I don't have the money
by 1:11 a.m. sharp,</i>

56:51.801 --> 56:56.473
<i>your boy, your grandson,
Chef Jeff, is dead.</i>
