WEBVTT

00:00.435 --> 00:01.970
THE WINE GUY'S GOT A CRUSH
ON ME.

00:01.970 --> 00:05.364
HIS NAME'S AIDAN.
HMM. REALLY?
IS THAT A MAN'S NAME?

00:05.364 --> 00:06.899
<i>PREVIOUSLY ON "BETRAYAL"...</i>

00:06.899 --> 00:10.803
THE COPS PULLED LOU OUT OF THE
RIVER WITH TWO BULLETS IN HIM.

00:10.803 --> 00:12.071
ANYTHING MISSING?

00:12.071 --> 00:15.107
OH, YEAH.
THE BULB FROM THE LID.

00:16.275 --> 00:18.878
YOU WERE WITH ME
ALL NIGHT AT THE CLUB.

00:18.878 --> 00:19.912
THAT'S THE NEW TRUTH.

00:19.912 --> 00:22.515
MY RECORD CLEANED,
A GREEN CARD.

00:22.515 --> 00:25.017
IF YOU MAKE ME AN AMERICAN,
I'LL DO WHATEVER YOU WANT.

00:25.017 --> 00:26.219
IF ANYTHING
GOES WRONG,

00:26.219 --> 00:28.120
SLIP THE WORD "FRIDAY"
INTO THE CONVERSATION,

00:28.120 --> 00:30.022
AND WE'LL GET YOU OUT.

00:35.761 --> 00:38.064
I'M ELAINE, BY THE WAY.
I OWN THE PLACE.

00:38.064 --> 00:40.266
OH. SARA.

00:45.571 --> 00:46.872
SARA!
SARA, WHAT'S WRONG?

00:46.872 --> 00:49.342
OH, GOD!
WHAT IS -- WHAT IS IT?
WHAT -- WHAT IS IT?

00:57.850 --> 01:00.086
NICE PHOTOS.

01:16.702 --> 01:18.271
DREW?

01:51.370 --> 01:53.272
EVERYTHING OKAY?

01:54.807 --> 01:56.842
YEAH. WHY?

01:58.444 --> 02:00.279
YOU SEEM
A LITTLE STRESSED.

02:02.381 --> 02:03.949
I GOT A LOT OF WORK.

02:03.949 --> 02:06.018
YEAH.

02:08.587 --> 02:11.857
SO, YOU'RE NOT ANNOYED
THAT I GOT SICK AT THE PARTY?

02:11.857 --> 02:15.061
NO, BUT, YOU KNOW,
NEXT TIME,

02:15.061 --> 02:17.129
A SIMPLE "LET'S GO"
WILL BE FINE.

02:18.831 --> 02:20.433
MAYBE YOU SHOULD
TALK ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED.

02:22.201 --> 02:25.071
YOU KNOW, TO YOUR THERAPIST,
ABOUT THE PANIC ATTACK.

02:28.107 --> 02:29.875
ANYWAY,
I REALLY LIKE THE PHOTOS.

02:31.477 --> 02:33.479
WHICH ONES?

02:33.479 --> 02:37.516
THE ONES OLIVER TOOK OF US
BEFORE THE PARTY.

02:37.516 --> 02:38.718
WHY --
WERE THERE MORE?

02:39.885 --> 02:43.155
I JUST TOOK SOME OF HIM
PLAYING T-BALL, AS WELL AS...

02:43.155 --> 02:45.458
WELL, YOU'LL HAVE TO
SHOW ME THOSE LATER.

02:45.458 --> 02:47.860
MM-HMM.

02:47.860 --> 02:49.328
YOU SHOULD GO TO BED.

02:49.328 --> 02:51.364
GET SOME REST.

02:51.364 --> 02:54.900
WELL, JUST, UH,
DON'T STAY UP TOO LATE.

03:01.807 --> 03:03.142
OKAY. NIGHT.

03:03.142 --> 03:04.844
GOOD NIGHT.

03:24.663 --> 03:27.666
-- Captions by VITAC --

03:38.210 --> 03:41.947
YOU WANT ME
TO TAKE OFF MY CLOTHES?

03:41.947 --> 03:45.718
WHY?
IS THERE A PROBLEM?

03:47.553 --> 03:48.788
THE MUSIC'S INTERFERING.

03:48.788 --> 03:50.189
I CAN'T HEAR CRAP.
I'M TRYING
TO FILTER IT OUT.

03:50.189 --> 03:52.258
<i>WHAT ABOUT WHAT I ASKED?</i>

03:52.258 --> 03:55.795
IF -- IF I'M GOING TO KEEP
LYING ABOUT T.J...

03:55.795 --> 04:00.266
...A LITTLE MORE MONEY
WOULD HELP.

04:03.235 --> 04:06.105
CHESS RECORDS --
INTERESTING STORY.

04:06.105 --> 04:09.108
OLD-TIME CHICAGO BLUES,

04:09.108 --> 04:10.776
SOME JAZZ,
EARLY ROCK 'N' ROLL.

04:10.776 --> 04:14.046
FOUNDED BY TWO BROTHERS,
POLISH IMMIGRANTS...

04:14.046 --> 04:16.248
...LAST NAME CZYZ.

04:16.248 --> 04:19.919
SPELLED C-Z-Y-Z.

04:19.919 --> 04:22.121
PRETTY OBVIOUS
WHY THEY CHANGED IT TO "CHESS."

04:22.121 --> 04:25.324
I NEED A DEDICATED, MULTI-BAND
DIGITAL NOISE GATE ALGORITHM.

04:25.324 --> 04:28.594
WE CAN, UH, RECORD NOW,
PROCESS BACK AT THE LAB.

04:28.594 --> 04:30.196
THAT'LL BE TOO LATE.

04:30.196 --> 04:32.665
DO YOU KNOW WHY
THEIR STORY IS SO INTERESTING?

04:32.665 --> 04:35.167
'CAUSE IT'S SO AMERICAN.

04:35.167 --> 04:37.470
"CZYZ" BECOMES "CHESS"...

04:37.470 --> 04:42.341
...LIKE "BRONISLOVA"
BECOMES "BRANDY."

04:42.341 --> 04:45.177
WE REINVENT OURSELVES.

04:45.177 --> 04:48.113
WE MAKE SACRIFICES...

04:48.113 --> 04:51.650
...ALL FOR THAT ELUSIVE
AMERICAN DREAM.

04:57.323 --> 05:00.659
I WONDER WHAT'S UNDERNEATH
THIS BLOUSE.

05:00.659 --> 05:02.161
I DID WHAT YOU ASKED.

05:02.161 --> 05:04.597
I GAVE HIM AN ALIBI.

05:04.597 --> 05:06.599
I WANT WHAT'S FAIR.

05:06.599 --> 05:08.734
AND I DON'T APPRECIATE

05:08.734 --> 05:10.536
THAT YOU COME TO MY HOUSE
AND MAKE DEMANDS.

05:12.705 --> 05:15.441
PLEASE.

05:15.441 --> 05:17.409
MY RENT IS LATE.

05:17.409 --> 05:19.512
THEY'RE GOING
TO EVICT US FRIDAY.

05:19.512 --> 05:21.447
IT SOUNDED
LIKE SHE SAID THE SAFE WORD.

05:21.447 --> 05:23.182
GIVE HER
A LITTLE MORE TIME.

05:23.182 --> 05:25.050
THEN I DON'T SEE
THE PROBLEM.

05:25.050 --> 05:30.689
JUST THINK OF ME
AS ONE OF YOUR CLIENTS.

05:48.173 --> 05:49.875
DAD?

05:49.875 --> 05:52.545
DAD, ARE YOU IN HERE?

05:52.545 --> 05:54.747
WHAT'S
WITH THE LOUD --

05:54.747 --> 05:57.182
BRANDY?

05:57.182 --> 05:59.018
YOU'RE HOME.

06:00.719 --> 06:03.455
THANK YOU, MR. KARSTEN.
GOOD NIGHT.

06:05.791 --> 06:07.359
WHAT WERE YOU GUYS
TALKING ABOUT?

06:07.359 --> 06:09.862
MUSIC'S FADING.
<i>NOTHING. I-I HAVE</i>
<i>SOME LEGAL PROBLEMS</i>

06:09.862 --> 06:11.363
I THOUGHT
HE COULD HELP ME WITH.

06:11.363 --> 06:13.032
YOU CAME ALL THE WAY HERE
FOR THAT?

06:13.032 --> 06:15.000
IT'S URGENT.

06:15.000 --> 06:16.502
UH, HOW HAVE YOU BEEN?

06:16.502 --> 06:17.636
OH, BUSY.

06:17.636 --> 06:20.339
I GOT A JOB -- A REAL ONE --
AT THAT GARAGE.

06:20.339 --> 06:22.041
THAT'S GREAT.

06:22.041 --> 06:24.877
I REALLY WANT TO HEAR ALL ABOUT
IT, BUT I NEED TO GET HOME NOW.

06:24.877 --> 06:27.413
ARE -- ARE YOU OKAY?

06:27.413 --> 06:31.050
Y-YOU SEEM DIFFERENT.
I'M FINE. REALLY.

06:31.050 --> 06:35.888
YOU KNOW, YOU DON'T HAVE TO
GO TO MY DAD TO ASK FOR HELP.

06:35.888 --> 06:37.556
YOU CAN COME TO ME.

06:37.556 --> 06:39.525
I OWE YOU
FOR WHAT YOU DID

06:39.525 --> 06:42.294
THAT TIME WHEN WE MADE UP
THE NEW TRUTH.

06:46.465 --> 06:48.734
UH, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

06:48.734 --> 06:50.135
THAT'S
WHAT YOU CALLED IT

06:50.135 --> 06:53.806
THAT TIME IN THE KITCHEN
WHEN JACK AND DAD WERE THERE.

06:53.806 --> 06:56.141
Y-YOU TOLD ME
TO SAY --

07:06.952 --> 07:08.454
SHE'S OUT.

07:08.454 --> 07:10.856
WE GOT NOTHING.

07:33.312 --> 07:36.081
COME ON, OLLIE, GET YOUR JACKET.
WE'RE GONNA BE LATE.

07:36.081 --> 07:38.751
WHICH ONE?
THE DENIM ONE.

07:38.751 --> 07:41.053
WHERE IS IT?
I DON'T KNOW.
WHERE DID YOU LAST LEAVE IT?

07:41.053 --> 07:43.055
I DON'T KNOW.
WELL, TRY YOUR ROOM.

07:47.026 --> 07:49.628
HOW'D YOU SLEEP?
GOOD.

07:49.628 --> 07:52.498
LOOK.

07:52.498 --> 07:55.167
THE NECKLACE --
YOU AND OLLIE GAVE IT TO ME

07:55.167 --> 07:57.603
FOR CHRISTMAS
TWO YEARS AGO, REMEMBER?

07:57.603 --> 07:59.938
OLLIE PICKED IT OUT.

07:59.938 --> 08:01.874
COME ON, MOM.
OKAY, BOSS MAN.

08:01.874 --> 08:03.642
ALL RIGHT.
SEE YOU LATER.

08:03.642 --> 08:04.643
SEE YOU.
BYE.

08:04.643 --> 08:07.613
BYE, DAD.
SEE YOU!

08:25.831 --> 08:28.333
STAFFORD, THIS IS GOSS.

08:28.333 --> 08:30.936
CPD WANTS YOU DOWN AT
A CRIME SCENE. SAYS IT'S URGENT.

08:30.936 --> 08:33.839
I'LL CHECK IT OUT, BUT I SUGGEST
YOU CALL ME AS SOON AS YOU CAN.

08:33.839 --> 08:35.874
DETECTIVE MITCHELL.

08:35.874 --> 08:37.910
YEAH,
WHO WANTS TO KNOW?

08:37.910 --> 08:39.144
HOWARD GOSS,

08:39.144 --> 08:41.013
INTERIM DIRECTOR OF THE STATE'S
ATTORNEY'S OFFICE,

08:41.013 --> 08:43.182
CRIMINAL DIVISION --
TAKING OVER FOR ABRAMS.

08:43.182 --> 08:45.317
GOOD FOR YOU.
WHERE'S STAFFORD?

08:45.317 --> 08:46.318
I WISH I KNEW.

08:46.318 --> 08:47.820
MAYBE YOU
CAN EXPLAIN TO ME

08:47.820 --> 08:50.522
WHY YOU WANTED AN A.S.A.
DOWN AT A ROUTINE CRIME SCENE.

08:50.522 --> 08:52.257
WELL, MAYBE
IT'S NOT SO ROUTINE.

08:52.257 --> 08:54.526
NEIGHBORS REPORTED GUNFIRE
AROUND 4:00 A.M.

08:54.526 --> 08:56.662
LOOKS LIKE
AN ATTEMPTED ROBBERY.

08:56.662 --> 08:58.097
KID DIDN'T EVEN MAKE IT
INSIDE.

08:58.097 --> 09:00.265
TRAGIC. AND?

09:00.265 --> 09:02.034
WE RAN THE KID'S GUN --

09:02.034 --> 09:05.037
A .38 REGISTERED
TO A ONE LOUIS MROZEK.

09:05.037 --> 09:07.673
THE VICTIM
IN THE T.J. KARSTEN CASE.

09:07.673 --> 09:09.742
BUT HERE'S
WHERE IT GETS INTERESTING.

09:09.742 --> 09:12.644
THE BULLETS THEY TOOK OUT
OF MROZEK -- ALSO FROM A .38.

09:14.046 --> 09:16.281
HOW MUCH YOU WANT TO BET
THEY MATCH?

09:16.281 --> 09:18.383
YOU'RE SAYING MROZEK WAS KILLED
WITH HIS OWN GUN?

09:18.383 --> 09:20.686
BY A KID
WITH A RAP SHEET A MILE LONG.

09:20.686 --> 09:23.055
HE'S DONE TIME
FOR CAR THEFT, LARCENY.

09:23.055 --> 09:26.792
THIS IS THE GUY YOU'RE
LOOKING FOR -- NOT T.J. KARSTEN.

09:26.792 --> 09:30.162
STAFFORD'S HAD IT ALL WRONG
FROM THE START.

09:57.156 --> 09:59.024
LOOK, I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE
TO GET AHOLD OF HIM,

09:59.024 --> 10:00.292
BUT I'M SURE
HE'LL CALL BACK.

10:00.292 --> 10:02.194
DREW IS THE ONE
WHO GOT ME TO DO THIS.

10:02.194 --> 10:03.962
WE'LL TAKE CARE OF YOU.
I PROMISE.

10:03.962 --> 10:06.732
BUT WE NEED KARSTEN ON RECORD
SAYING SOMETHING WE CAN USE.

10:06.732 --> 10:08.267
YOU HAVE TO
GO BACK IN THERE.

10:08.267 --> 10:10.235
ARE YOU CRAZY?

10:10.235 --> 10:13.272
KARSTEN KNOWS.
WE'RE ALREADY WORKING
ON YOUR GREEN CARD.

10:13.272 --> 10:15.007
YOU NEED TO HOLD UP
YOUR END OF THE DEAL.

10:15.007 --> 10:18.310
WHAT I NEED IS FOR YOU
TO LEAVE ME ALONE.

10:18.310 --> 10:21.046
FORGET THE DEAL.
TELL DREW I'M OUT.

10:22.481 --> 10:24.149
YEAH, OUR KID
GOT TO HER PHONE

10:24.149 --> 10:26.752
AND ACCIDENTALLY
CHANGED THE PASS CODE.

10:26.752 --> 10:30.856
OH, SHE'S BUSY.
THAT'S WHY I'M CALLING.

10:30.856 --> 10:33.225
NO, WE DON'T WANT
TO RESET THE WHOLE PHONE.

10:33.225 --> 10:34.693
SHE'D LOSE ALL OF HER INFO.

10:34.693 --> 10:37.162
LOOK, MY NAME'S ON THE ACCOUNT,
TOO, SO WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?

10:37.162 --> 10:39.765
FINE. I GET IT.

10:39.765 --> 10:42.634
NO, YOU'VE BEEN VERY HELPFUL.

10:42.634 --> 10:46.305
JACKASS.

11:09.700 --> 11:11.569
IT'S A GOOD PLACE
TO THINK...

11:11.569 --> 11:13.971
AMONG OTHER THINGS.

11:21.311 --> 11:25.849
FOUND THIS ON THE SHELF --
ONE OF MY FAVORITES.

11:25.849 --> 11:29.419
EXCEPT IT'S,
UH -- IT'S FAKE,

11:29.419 --> 11:31.855
LIKE THE TV, THE STOVE,
EVERYTHING.

11:34.758 --> 11:37.227
DID YOU WANT HIM
TO FIND OUT?

11:37.227 --> 11:38.729
WAS THAT THE IDEA?

11:38.729 --> 11:40.297
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

11:51.675 --> 11:53.176
I THOUGHT I DELETED IT.

11:53.176 --> 11:54.578
YOU THOUGHT?
DID HE SEE IT?

11:54.578 --> 11:56.446
NO, BUT HOW COULD YOU
DO THAT?

11:58.415 --> 12:00.717
I ONLY GET YOU
FOR A FEW HOURS AT A TIME.

12:00.717 --> 12:02.619
I JUST WANTED
SOMETHING TO KEEP.

12:06.657 --> 12:09.059
WE HAVE TO BE
MORE CAREFUL.

12:09.059 --> 12:12.596
YOU CAN'T JUST DO SOMETHING
LIKE THAT WITHOUT --
I KNOW. I'M SORRY.

12:14.431 --> 12:18.936
IT JUST FELT LIKE SOME PART
OF YOU WANTS TO GET CAUGHT.

12:20.304 --> 12:22.406
YOU KNOW,
MAYBE SOME PART OF ME DOES.

12:22.406 --> 12:25.442
I -- JUST SO WE CAN STOP LYING
AND SNEAKING AROUND.

12:25.442 --> 12:27.477
'CAUSE IT MAY NOT BOTHER YOU,
BUT IT SURE AS HELL BOTHERS ME.

12:27.477 --> 12:28.912
OF COURSE
IT BOTHERS ME!

12:28.912 --> 12:30.781
WELL,
THEN WHY KEEP DOING IT?
YOU MEAN HIDING IT?

12:30.781 --> 12:33.817
NO, ANY OF IT.
I MEAN, WHAT'S THE END GAME?

12:33.817 --> 12:35.619
WOULD YOU EVER
LEAVE YOUR HUSBAND?

12:35.619 --> 12:37.821
WOULD YOU EVER
LEAVE ELAINE?

12:48.598 --> 12:51.535
I MET HER, YOU KNOW --
AT THE RESTAURANT.

12:51.535 --> 12:54.938
WHAT?
SHE'S LOVELY.

12:54.938 --> 12:57.074
SHE'S CHARMING.
SHE'S VERY FRIENDLY.

12:57.074 --> 12:58.742
SHE'S SMART.
WHAT DID YOU SAY TO HER?

12:58.742 --> 13:01.244
NOTHING. WE HAD A DRINK.
SHE HAD NO IDEA WHO I WAS.

13:01.244 --> 13:02.512
WHY THE HELL
WOULD YOU DO THAT?

13:02.512 --> 13:04.281
BECAUSE I WANTED
TO KNOW ABOUT HER,

13:04.281 --> 13:05.949
BECAUSE I WANT
TO KNOW ABOUT YOU.

13:05.949 --> 13:07.050
AND YOU'RE ACCUSING ME

13:07.050 --> 13:09.152
OF -- OF BEING CARELESS
FOR TAKING A PICTURE,

13:09.152 --> 13:11.455
AND YOU SAT DOWN AND
YOU HAD DRINKS WITH MY WIFE?!

13:13.991 --> 13:16.093
DO YOU LOVE HER?

13:16.093 --> 13:19.329
COME ON, SARA.
DO YOU?

13:19.329 --> 13:22.799
I'VE BEEN WITH HER
FOR 20 YEARS.

13:24.134 --> 13:25.669
YOU KNOW, SHE --
SHE GETS MY JOKES.

13:25.669 --> 13:26.770
SHE KNOWS EVERY REFERENCE.

13:26.770 --> 13:28.705
SHE KNOWS
EVERYTHING ABOUT ME.

13:30.841 --> 13:32.142
ALMOST.

13:32.142 --> 13:36.580
YEAH. ALMOST.

13:36.580 --> 13:38.715
I LOVE HER.

13:38.715 --> 13:42.786
YOU KNOW, IT'S NOT THE SAME
AS IT ONCE WAS, BUT STILL.

13:42.786 --> 13:45.789
AND I LOVE DREW.

13:45.789 --> 13:48.792
SO WHAT ARE WE
DOING HERE?

13:53.130 --> 13:54.931
YOU KNOW, YOU REALIZE
YOU COULD HAVE ASKED

13:54.931 --> 13:56.466
ONE OF THE KITCHEN STAFF
TO SIGN FOR THIS?

13:56.466 --> 13:59.503
YES. I COULD HAVE DONE THAT,
BUT, YOU KNOW, IT'S COMPLICATED.

13:59.503 --> 14:02.172
YEAH.

14:02.172 --> 14:03.840
YOU DON'T SEEM
COMPLICATED.

14:03.840 --> 14:05.475
OUCH.

14:05.475 --> 14:08.712
I JUST MEAN YOU -- YOU SEEM
REMARKABLY FREE OF BAGGAGE.

14:08.712 --> 14:10.547
OH, I DON'T KNOW.
I'VE GOT MY PROBLEMS.

14:10.547 --> 14:11.882
MM-HMM. LIKE WHAT?

14:11.882 --> 14:15.252
LIKE WANTING
WHAT I CAN'T HAVE.

14:18.755 --> 14:20.257
ELAINE.

14:20.257 --> 14:21.992
HEY.

14:21.992 --> 14:23.460
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

14:23.460 --> 14:24.861
UH, MEETING
ENDED EARLY.

14:24.861 --> 14:27.330
YOU WANT
TO GRAB A COFFEE?

14:27.330 --> 14:28.999
I WOULD LOVE TO,
BUT, UH,

14:28.999 --> 14:31.401
I HAVE THIS CORPORATE LUNCHEON
AT 11:00.

14:31.401 --> 14:33.537
IT'S GONNA BE
A FULL HOUSE.

14:33.537 --> 14:34.905
EVERYTHING OKAY?

14:34.905 --> 14:36.540
YEAH.
YEAH, I'M FINE.

14:36.540 --> 14:38.341
DID YOU
NEED ANYTHING ELSE?

14:38.341 --> 14:39.576
WE'RE GOOD. THANKS.

14:39.576 --> 14:41.445
UH, SORRY.
JACK, THIS IS, UH --

14:41.445 --> 14:43.346
AIDAN.
THE WINE GUY.

14:43.346 --> 14:44.714
ACTUALLY,
WOULD YOU MIND

14:44.714 --> 14:46.883
BRINGING IN
THE BOX OF PINOT, PLEASE?

14:46.883 --> 14:48.251
SURE.

14:49.886 --> 14:51.688
NICE GUY.

14:53.623 --> 14:55.025
WHAT'S GOING ON?

14:55.025 --> 14:56.927
UH, NOTHING.
I TOLD YOU.

14:56.927 --> 15:00.263
JACK,
YOU ARE NOT YOURSELF.

15:00.263 --> 15:02.132
WHAT'S WRONG?

15:06.203 --> 15:09.272
I GOT TO GO.
JACK, TALK TO ME.

15:09.272 --> 15:11.475
IT'S ME.
ABOUT WHAT? I TOLD YOU.
I'M FINE. ALL RIGHT?

15:18.281 --> 15:20.517
SO, YOU TOLD YOUR HUSBAND
ABOUT ME?

15:22.519 --> 15:25.722
YEAH, I TOLD HIM YOU WERE
OVERCHARGING ME FOR MERLOT.

15:25.722 --> 15:28.592
BUT YOU DON'T KNOW
FOR SURE.

15:28.592 --> 15:31.661
DO I HAVE PROOF? NO.

15:31.661 --> 15:33.930
BUT ISN'T IT OBVIOUS?

15:33.930 --> 15:35.899
SHE'S NOTHING
BUT TROUBLE, JACK,

15:35.899 --> 15:37.834
AND YOU SHOULD HAVE BEEN
ON TOP OF IT.

15:37.834 --> 15:39.636
WELL, FORGIVE ME
FOR NOT BEING PSYCHIC.

15:39.636 --> 15:42.239
YOU DON'T NEED TO BE PSYCHIC
TO SEE WE'RE BEING PLAYED.

15:42.239 --> 15:44.674
YOU USED TO BE
BETTER THAN THIS.

15:44.674 --> 15:46.743
NOW, ARE YOU
GONNA HANDLE THIS THING

15:46.743 --> 15:49.012
OR DO I NEED
TO BRING IN SOMEONE WHO CAN?

15:49.012 --> 15:51.648
OH, BY "SOMEONE,"
YOU MEAN ZAREK?
YEAH.

15:51.648 --> 15:52.983
HE'S EFFECTIVE.

15:54.251 --> 15:57.287
I'LL STRAIGHTEN OUT BRANDY,
BUT WE STILL NEED HER, OKAY?

15:57.287 --> 15:59.489
SHE'S THE ONLY ALIBI
T.J.'s GOT.

15:59.489 --> 16:01.391
OKAY.

16:01.391 --> 16:04.895
BUT IF SHE'S WORKING
FOR THE FEDS, JACK...

16:04.895 --> 16:06.496
SHE'S NOT AN ALIBI.

16:06.496 --> 16:08.965
SHE'S A PROBLEM.

16:12.869 --> 16:15.472
BUT I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
WHERE -- WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

16:15.472 --> 16:17.174
TO VISIT FRIENDS.

16:17.174 --> 16:18.208
BUT FOR HOW LONG?

16:18.208 --> 16:19.609
I DON'T KNOW.

16:19.609 --> 16:22.212
YOU KISSED ME.

16:22.212 --> 16:23.613
WHAT?

16:23.613 --> 16:26.383
YOU SAID THAT WE DON'T KISS,
BUT THEN YOU DID. YOU KISSED ME.

16:26.383 --> 16:30.987
I-I DID IT BECAUSE I DIDN'T
WANT US TO GET IN TROUBLE.

16:30.987 --> 16:33.390
IN TROUBLE FOR WHAT?

16:33.390 --> 16:34.991
WHAT'S GOING ON?

16:34.991 --> 16:37.360
YEAH, THAT'S WHAT
I'VE BEEN WONDERING.

16:37.360 --> 16:39.896
T.J., YOU MIND?
BRANDY AND I NEED TO TALK.

16:39.896 --> 16:41.498
NO,
I'M DONE TALKING.

16:41.498 --> 16:43.166
OH, REALLY? TO US?

16:43.166 --> 16:44.634
OR TO THE FEDS?

16:44.634 --> 16:46.303
YOU THINK
THEY DON'T KNOW?

16:46.303 --> 16:48.772
YOU THINK ANYONE BELIEVES
T.J. WAS WITH ME?

16:48.772 --> 16:50.207
WELL,
BUT THEY DO BELIEVE IT.

16:50.207 --> 16:51.441
THEY --
THEY LET ME GO.

16:51.441 --> 16:52.876
I'M SORRY, BABE.

16:52.876 --> 16:55.879
I-I DON'T MEAN TO SCARE YOU,
BUT I CAN'T HELP YOU ANYMORE.

16:55.879 --> 16:58.315
THE BEST THING WOULD BE
FOR ME TO TAKE AMY

16:58.315 --> 16:59.983
AND GO WHERE NO ONE
WILL EVER FIND US.

16:59.983 --> 17:02.752
YOU ARE NOT LEAVING.
DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

17:02.752 --> 17:04.888
YOU WILL SHUT THE HELL UP
AND STAY HERE

17:04.888 --> 17:06.656
UNTIL T.J.'s TRIAL,
JUST LIKE WE AGREED.

17:06.656 --> 17:07.924
STOP TELLING ME
WHAT TO DO.

17:07.924 --> 17:10.193
YOU MADE A PROMISE,
AND IF YOU BREAK IT...

17:10.193 --> 17:12.028
THEN WHAT?
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO? KILL ME?

17:12.028 --> 17:13.730
JUST GET OUT. GET OUT!

17:13.730 --> 17:15.532
LET HER GO.
ALL RIGHT. CALM DOWN.

17:15.532 --> 17:18.235
I SAID LET HER GO!

17:18.235 --> 17:19.603
YOU STOP SCARING HER!

17:19.603 --> 17:20.937
T.J.,
SHE'S NOT WHAT YOU THINK.

17:20.937 --> 17:22.706
YES, SHE IS.
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

17:22.706 --> 17:27.077
STOP TALKING!
YOU ALWAYS TALK DOWN TO ME!

17:27.077 --> 17:29.713
YOU BULLY PEOPLE,
YOU USE THEM, YOU HURT THEM,

17:29.713 --> 17:31.114
BECAUSE THAT'S YOUR JOB!

17:31.114 --> 17:33.016
RELAX, OKAY?

17:33.016 --> 17:34.918
EVER SINCE WE WERE KIDS,
YOU WANTED TO HURT ME.

17:34.918 --> 17:37.354
THAT'S NOT TRUE.
YES, IT IS,
AND YOU KNOW IT.

17:37.354 --> 17:39.389
YOU LET ME DRIVE THAT NIGHT!

17:39.389 --> 17:40.957
YOU DIDN'T STOP ME!

17:40.957 --> 17:43.560
YOU WANTED IT TO HAPPEN!
YOU WANTED TO HURT ME!

17:43.560 --> 17:47.530
YOU HAD NOTHING --
NO PARENTS, NO MONEY!

17:47.530 --> 17:49.699
WE TOOK YOU IN.
WE MADE YOU ONE OF US.

17:49.699 --> 17:52.736
WE MADE YOU PART OF THE FAMILY,
AND YOU HATED US FOR IT.

17:52.736 --> 17:56.873
YOU TOOK IT OUT ON ME.

17:56.873 --> 18:02.779
EVERY TIME I SEE YOU,
I KNOW.

18:51.415 --> 18:52.783
HELLO?

18:52.783 --> 18:54.852
HI. YOU HAVEN'T SEEN MY PHONE,
HAVE YOU?

18:54.852 --> 18:56.454
NOPE. SORRY.

18:56.454 --> 18:58.556
I don't know
what I did with it.

18:58.556 --> 19:00.992
ANYWAY, HOW'S YOUR DAY?

19:00.992 --> 19:02.159
Good.

19:02.159 --> 19:04.095
HOW ABOUT YOU?
ANY PLANS?

19:04.095 --> 19:07.565
NO, JUST A MEETING
THIS AFTERNOON.

19:07.565 --> 19:10.701
AT THE OFFICE?
No, just over coffee.

19:10.701 --> 19:12.870
ALL RIGHT,
I'LL KEEP LOOKING.

19:12.870 --> 19:15.339
LOVE YOU.
LOVE YOU, TOO.

19:22.680 --> 19:24.548
WHAT IF HE COMES BACK?

19:24.548 --> 19:26.350
OR -- OR IF YOUR FATHER
SENDS SOMEONE ELSE?

19:26.350 --> 19:28.552
THEN I'LL
BE RIGHT HERE.

19:28.552 --> 19:30.755
I-I-I WON'T LET ANYTHING
HAPPEN TO YOU.

19:30.755 --> 19:33.424
OH, YOU DON'T KNOW
HOW MUCH TROUBLE I'M IN.

19:33.424 --> 19:36.861
WELL, I DON'T THINK ANYONE COULD
BE IN MORE TROUBLE THAN ME.

19:36.861 --> 19:38.930
LISTEN,
YOU HEARD JACK.

19:38.930 --> 19:41.399
UH, IF YOU STAY HERE,
IT'LL BE OKAY.

19:41.399 --> 19:43.367
THAT'S ALL THEY WANT.

19:43.367 --> 19:48.372
IT'S NOT THAT SIMPLE.

19:48.372 --> 19:51.208
I MADE MISTAKES.

19:51.208 --> 19:56.147
BUT IF THEY WANT TO, THEY CAN
FIND YOU WHEREVER YOU GO.

19:56.147 --> 19:58.115
HERE, I CAN HELP YOU.

19:58.115 --> 20:02.019
IF YOU LEAVE, I CAN'T.

20:02.019 --> 20:04.088
STAY HERE.

20:04.088 --> 20:08.426
LET ME HELP YOU.
I WANT TO HELP.

20:42.059 --> 20:43.761
JACK?

20:49.767 --> 20:51.602
JACK?

20:54.872 --> 20:57.875
SO, NOTHING HAPPENED?
NO.

20:57.875 --> 21:01.879
YOU DON'T THINK
THAT JACK SEEMS OFF?

21:01.879 --> 21:04.348
HE'S GOT A LOT OF THINGS
ON HIS MIND.

21:04.348 --> 21:05.983
A LOT ON HIS MIND?

21:05.983 --> 21:08.319
NO, HE'S A WRECK.

21:08.319 --> 21:12.690
WELL, HE CERTAINLY
ISN'T AT THE TOP OF HIS GAME.

21:12.690 --> 21:15.292
I THOUGHT
IT MIGHT BE SOMETHING AT HOME.

21:15.292 --> 21:17.294
AND I THOUGHT
IT WAS SOMETHING AT WORK.
AH.

21:17.294 --> 21:19.397
BECAUSE
EVER SINCE T.J.'s ARREST,

21:19.397 --> 21:22.233
HE'S BEEN PREOCCUPIED
AND DISTANT.

21:22.233 --> 21:24.468
MAYBE THIS IS ALL
TOO MUCH PRESSURE FOR HIM.

21:24.468 --> 21:26.570
JACK INSISTED
ON HANDLING IT HIMSELF.

21:26.570 --> 21:27.705
WELL,
I'M SURE HE DID,

21:27.705 --> 21:29.373
BUT MAYBE DEFENDING
YOUR OWN BROTHER-IN-LAW

21:29.373 --> 21:30.741
IS NOT
THE BEST LEGAL STRATEGY.

21:30.741 --> 21:33.511
I SUGGESTED
BRINGING IN ANOTHER LAWYER,

21:33.511 --> 21:36.347
BUT HE DIDN'T WANT
ANYONE ELSE REPRESENTING T.J.

21:36.347 --> 21:38.382
YOU KNOW THEIR HISTORY.

21:38.382 --> 21:42.820
I IMAGINE JACK STILL FEELS
RESPONSIBLE FOR WHAT HAPPENED.

21:44.688 --> 21:48.492
THE ACCIDENT
WAS A LONG TIME AGO, DAD.

21:48.492 --> 21:51.028
JACK NEVER
TALKS ABOUT IT.

21:51.028 --> 21:55.566
ELAINE, THE THINGS
MEN NEVER TALK ABOUT

21:55.566 --> 21:58.035
ARE THE THINGS
THAT DRIVE THEM CRAZY.

22:03.441 --> 22:07.978
WE GREW UP TOGETHER.
WE DID EVERYTHING TOGETHER.

22:07.978 --> 22:09.580
T.J. KNEW ALL THE BANDS.

22:09.580 --> 22:13.017
I MEAN, HE COULD TALK OUR WAY
INTO ANY CLUB, ANY BAR.

22:13.017 --> 22:16.821
ME -- I WAS QUIET,
YOU KNOW, THE WINGMAN.

22:16.821 --> 22:20.091
BUT HE WAS
THE PRINCE OF THE NORTH SIDE.

22:20.091 --> 22:24.328
YOU KNOW, EVERYONE KNEW HIM
OR WANTED TO BE HIM.

22:24.328 --> 22:27.465
AND HE HAD THIS UNBELIEVABLY
TRICKED-OUT CAMARO.

22:29.200 --> 22:31.202
HE LOVED THAT CAR.

22:38.109 --> 22:41.979
ONE NIGHT, WE GOT WASTED
AFTER A SHOW AT THE METRO.

22:41.979 --> 22:43.647
WE WERE DRIVING HOME.

22:43.647 --> 22:46.650
WE CUT THROUGH
THE SKOKIE LAGOONS, NO LIGHTS --

22:46.650 --> 22:49.220
JUST PUSHING THE CAR
FASTER AND FASTER.

22:54.258 --> 22:57.561
WE TOOK A CURVE TOO FAST,
AND THE CAR --

22:57.561 --> 22:59.930
IT PLUNGED
INTO THE WATER.

22:59.930 --> 23:02.066
I MEAN IT --
IT HIT LIKE A SHOCK.

23:02.066 --> 23:04.568
THE WATER STARTED
POURING IN EVERYWHERE.

23:04.568 --> 23:07.238
AND I'M SCREAMING, YOU KNOW,
"T.J., WE GOT TO GET OUT,"

23:07.238 --> 23:09.707
BUT HE'S NOT MOVING,

23:09.707 --> 23:13.244
AND THE WATER'S CLOSING UP
OVER US.

23:13.244 --> 23:15.446
I CAN'T SEE.
I CAN'T BREATHE.

23:15.446 --> 23:19.216
AND T.J.'s STRAPPED IN,
AND M-MY FINGERS AREN'T WORKING.

23:19.216 --> 23:22.620
AND I START TO BLACK OUT.

23:26.357 --> 23:28.192
SO, I LEAVE HIM,

23:28.192 --> 23:33.797
AND I SWIM UP AND GRAB SOME AIR
AND DIVE BACK DOWN.

23:33.797 --> 23:35.132
BUT IT'S TOO LATE.

23:35.132 --> 23:37.268
YOU KNOW, HE --
HE WAS UNDER

23:37.268 --> 23:39.703
FOR WAY TOO LONG
WITHOUT ANY AIR.

23:39.703 --> 23:42.940
AND HE'S STILL ALIVE,
BUT HE'S...

23:46.977 --> 23:52.349
AFTERWARDS,
EVERYBODY'S THANKING ME.

23:52.349 --> 23:55.486
YOU KNOW,
SAYING I SAVED HIM.

24:01.959 --> 24:04.995
BUT I WAS DRIVING.

24:07.164 --> 24:10.334
I JUST WANTED
TO DRIVE THAT CAR SO BAD.

24:10.334 --> 24:12.903
I-I TOOK THE KEYS
FROM HIM.

24:12.903 --> 24:15.306
I NEVER TOLD ANYONE.

24:18.676 --> 24:20.344
NOT EVEN HIM.

24:23.247 --> 24:27.651
MAYBE I-I WAITED
A SECOND TOO LONG.

24:27.651 --> 24:32.690
YOU KNOW, MAYBE I COULD HAVE
GOT HIM OUT SOONER.

24:32.690 --> 24:34.158
LOOK
WHAT I DID TO HIM.

24:34.158 --> 24:37.161
LOOK WHAT I TOOK AWAY.

25:02.566 --> 25:04.935
GIVE ME YOUR CLOTHES.
I'LL WASH THEM.

25:04.935 --> 25:06.707
THANKS.

25:06.707 --> 25:09.543
IT'S SWEET OF YOU TO WANT
TO GET CLEANED UP FOR AMY.

25:09.543 --> 25:10.945
SHE'LL BE HAPPY
TO SEE YOU.

25:12.513 --> 25:14.415
I'M GLAD YOU'RE STAYING.

25:14.415 --> 25:18.285
WELL, I JUST SAID
I WOULD THINK ABOUT IT.

25:18.285 --> 25:22.089
I'M STILL GLAD.

25:22.089 --> 25:26.193
WHY?

25:26.193 --> 25:28.128
WHY DO YOU
CARE SO MUCH?

25:40.574 --> 25:42.209
WHAT?

25:43.677 --> 25:46.847
NOTHING. I JUST...

25:51.285 --> 25:55.289
UM...BRANDY?

25:55.289 --> 25:57.825
WHAT?

25:57.825 --> 26:02.396
I-I THOUGHT
THIS WASN'T GONNA HAPPEN.

26:02.396 --> 26:06.367
YEAH. IT WON'T.

26:16.110 --> 26:17.878
I'M SORRY
ABOUT THE PHOTO.

26:17.878 --> 26:20.514
IT'S OKAY.

26:20.514 --> 26:21.849
I MEAN,
YOU WERE RIGHT.

26:21.849 --> 26:27.154
I DO HAVE THIS SECRET HOPE
THAT, SOMEHOW,

26:27.154 --> 26:30.324
SOMETHING WILL HAPPEN,
AND EVERYTHING WILL CHANGE.

26:30.324 --> 26:34.662
WHAT WOULD YOU WANT TO DO --
WANT TO BE --

26:34.662 --> 26:37.331
IF YOU WEREN'T WORKING
FOR THATCHER KARSTEN?

26:37.331 --> 26:42.403
I DON'T KNOW.

26:42.403 --> 26:47.374
SOMETIMES, I FEEL
LIKE I'M IN THIS...CAGE.

26:47.374 --> 26:51.512
THE CRAZY PART IS
EVERY SINGLE BAR I PUT THERE --

26:51.512 --> 26:54.248
YOU KNOW, WHO I AM,
WHAT I DO.

26:54.248 --> 26:57.851
YOU KNOW, IT WAS MY CHOICE
EVERY STEP OF THE WAY.

27:00.287 --> 27:02.456
WELL, HERE'S THE THING.

27:02.456 --> 27:06.327
YOU PUT THE BARS UP.
YOU CAN TAKE THEM DOWN.

28:02.983 --> 28:05.853
EXCUSE ME?

28:05.853 --> 28:07.755
<i>ALL IMPECCABLY FURNISHED</i>

28:07.755 --> 28:10.290
<i>WITH COOK'S KITCHENS</i>
<i>AND BREATHTAKING VIEWS.</i>

28:10.290 --> 28:12.760
<i>STOP BY, AND ONE</i>
<i>OF OUR REPRESENTATIVES</i>

28:12.760 --> 28:15.396
<i>WOULD BE HAPPY TO SHOW YOU</i>
<i>A MODEL APARTMENT</i>

28:15.396 --> 28:18.065
<i>JUST LIKE THE ONE</i>
<i>THAT COULD BE YOURS.</i>

28:18.065 --> 28:21.802
<i>THE MONTAGUE --</i>
<i>WHERE YOUR FUTURE AWAITS.</i>

28:31.945 --> 28:34.782
NOW, WHAT DID YOU SAY
YOUR NAME WAS AGAIN?

28:34.782 --> 28:35.816
BOB. BOB DREW.

28:35.816 --> 28:37.418
AND ARE YOU NEW
TO CHICAGO?

28:37.418 --> 28:40.020
JUST MOVED
FROM NEW YORK.
OH, I'VE NEVER BEEN.

28:40.020 --> 28:42.022
YEAH, I KEEP
TELLING MY HUSBAND.

28:42.022 --> 28:43.557
STUPID SILLY.

28:43.557 --> 28:45.492
I BROUGHT
THE WRONG MASTER KEY.

28:45.492 --> 28:48.595
I'LL JUST BE A MINUTE.

29:03.610 --> 29:05.746
WE OFFER A CHOICE
OF VIKING OR SUB-ZERO

29:05.746 --> 29:07.548
AND, OF COURSE,
A WALK-IN PANTRY.

29:07.548 --> 29:08.982
YOU DO LIKE TO COOK?
NO.

29:08.982 --> 29:10.517
AH, HERE WE ARE.

29:12.119 --> 29:13.554
HERE WE GO.

29:19.593 --> 29:21.095
ET VOILà.

29:23.163 --> 29:24.998
NO.

29:24.998 --> 29:27.701
NO, NO, NO.
THIS IS ALL WRONG.

29:27.701 --> 29:29.770
YOU DON'T LIKE IT?
THIS IS NORTH.

29:29.770 --> 29:32.773
I NEED WEST. I TOLD YOU
FACING THE WRIGLEY BUILDING.

29:32.773 --> 29:34.208
WELL,
THEY'RE ALL NICE VIEWS.

29:34.208 --> 29:36.376
THE APARTMENT ON THE TV --
WHERE IS IT?

29:36.376 --> 29:38.846
UH, THAT'S PENTHOUSE 15,
BUT WE'RE NOT SHOWING IT.

29:38.846 --> 29:40.180
SIR. SIR!

30:52.252 --> 30:53.453
ORESTES,
WHAT'S UP?

30:55.289 --> 30:57.090
LET ME CALL YOU BACK.

30:57.090 --> 30:59.359
IT'S ABOUT T.J.

30:59.359 --> 31:00.727
I HAVE TO GO.

31:02.796 --> 31:05.232
THANK YOU.

31:09.102 --> 31:11.572
YOU'RE A GOOD MAN,
JACK McALLISTER.

31:11.572 --> 31:13.774
YOU MAY NOT KNOW IT,
BUT I DO.

32:14.372 --> 32:15.807
SORRY I'M LATE.
OH.

32:15.807 --> 32:18.476
MY INTERVIEW WENT LONG.
DID YOU GET MY TEXT?

32:18.476 --> 32:20.144
NO, BUT IT'S OKAY.

32:20.144 --> 32:21.479
SO, WHAT'S
THIS ARTICLE ABOUT?

32:21.479 --> 32:23.114
ALISSA
DIDN'T TELL YOU?

32:23.114 --> 32:25.750
SHE JUST SAID YOU WERE
DOING THIS MAJOR FEATURE
AND WE HAD TO MEET.

32:25.750 --> 32:27.885
"25 CHICAGOANS
ON THE VERGE."

32:27.885 --> 32:30.221
ALL UNDER 40,
ALL UP-AND-COMERS.

32:30.221 --> 32:32.657
NEW BLOOD --
NOT THE SAME OLD FACES.

32:32.657 --> 32:34.692
AND I WAS THINKING
SIMPLE BLACK-AND-WHITES,

32:34.692 --> 32:36.794
BUT YOU'RE THE EXPERT.

32:36.794 --> 32:40.098
IS THE LIST SET,
OR IS THERE STILL ROOM?

32:40.098 --> 32:41.332
WHY?
YOU GOT SOMEONE IN MIND?

32:42.767 --> 32:44.769
UP TILL NOW,
THE STORY'S BEEN

32:44.769 --> 32:46.838
THAT T.J. KARSTEN
KILLED LOU MROZEK,

32:46.838 --> 32:49.007
BUT THAT'S ALL IT IS --
A STORY.

32:49.007 --> 32:50.642
YOU WANT
TO HEAR MINE?

32:50.642 --> 32:52.377
DARIUS MILLER,
KNOWN AS LIL' D,

32:52.377 --> 32:54.345
IS ON THE STREET
LOOKING FOR A TARGET.

32:54.345 --> 32:55.847
HE FINDS ONE --
LOU MROZEK.

32:55.847 --> 32:58.216
LIL' D TAKES OUT HIS KNIFE,
APPROACHES.

32:58.216 --> 33:00.685
BUT LOU'S BEEN UNEASY LATELY --
PARANOID.

33:00.685 --> 33:02.820
HE'S PACKING A GUN.
THERE'S A STRUGGLE.

33:02.820 --> 33:04.355
LIL' D GETS AHOLD
OF THE GUN

33:04.355 --> 33:06.124
AND SHOOTS LOU TWICE,
KILLING HIM.

33:06.124 --> 33:08.926
AND THEN HE RUNS AND
THE MURDER WEAPON DISAPPEARS.

33:08.926 --> 33:10.862
UNTIL NOW.

33:10.862 --> 33:12.664
WORD TRAVELS FAST.

33:12.664 --> 33:16.367
I KNOW THE WEAPON'S BEEN FOUND
COVERED WITH LIL' D's PRINTS

33:16.367 --> 33:18.102
BUT
NOT T.J. KARSTEN'S.

33:18.102 --> 33:21.172
NOT THIS OFFICE'S
FINEST HOUR. AGREED.

33:21.172 --> 33:23.174
RIGHT. THEN YOU UNDERSTAND
WHAT I'M GETTING AT.

33:23.174 --> 33:26.644
LOOK, DREW STAFFORD'S BEEN
PURSUING A PERSONAL VENDETTA

33:26.644 --> 33:28.813
AGAINST THE KARSTEN FAMILY
SINCE DAY ONE,

33:28.813 --> 33:31.516
AND WHEN THIS NEW EVIDENCE
IS DISCLOSED,

33:31.516 --> 33:34.519
HIS CASE AGAINST T.J. --
HIS STORY -- IS DONE.

33:34.519 --> 33:36.387
AND IT'LL BE
ALL OVER THE MEDIA

33:36.387 --> 33:39.023
THAT YOUR DEPARTMENT
PROSECUTED AN INNOCENT MAN.

33:39.023 --> 33:44.228
NOW, IS THAT THE FIRST MARK
YOU WANT TO MAKE AS DIRECTOR?

33:47.699 --> 33:49.500
HE LED
A MAJOR CORRUPTION PROBE

33:49.500 --> 33:51.502
INTO THE CHICAGO
POLICE DEPARTMENT.

33:51.502 --> 33:54.005
HE JUST SUCCESSFULLY
PROSECUTED BRIBERY CHARGES

33:54.005 --> 33:55.873
FOR THE COUNCILMAN FIELDING
CASE.

33:55.873 --> 33:58.409
HE'S A CRUSADER,
BUT HE'S STILL PRETTY UNKNOWN,

33:58.409 --> 34:00.011
AND HE'S YOUR HUSBAND.

34:00.011 --> 34:01.412
I-I KNOW,
BUT I AM TELLING YOU,

34:01.412 --> 34:03.281
HE'S A REALLY GOOD SUBJECT
FOR THIS ARTICLE.

34:03.281 --> 34:04.415
IF YOU WANT "ON THE VERGE,"

34:04.415 --> 34:07.919
THE GUY IS GONNA BE SENATOR
OR GOVERNOR SOMEDAY.

34:07.919 --> 34:09.187
HE NEVER STOPS WORKING.

34:26.571 --> 34:27.572
OKAY, GREAT.

34:27.572 --> 34:29.340
DREW,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

34:29.340 --> 34:32.143
MET AN ALDERMAN
FOR DRINKS. YOU?

34:32.143 --> 34:34.545
OH, JUST THE MAN
WE WERE TALKING ABOUT.

34:34.545 --> 34:36.013
I'M GREG.

34:36.013 --> 34:37.348
GREG'S GONNA INCLUDE YOU

34:37.348 --> 34:40.651
IN AN ARTICLE
OF RISING LOCAL STARS.

34:40.651 --> 34:42.053
SARA'S BEEN
PRETTY PERSUASIVE.

34:42.053 --> 34:44.188
HE'S GONNA FEATURE YOU
IN THE MAGAZINE.

34:46.257 --> 34:48.993
UH, THAT'S...GREAT.

34:48.993 --> 34:50.061
THANKS.

34:50.061 --> 34:51.829
I GOT TO GO.
OKAY.

34:51.829 --> 34:53.331
MEETING MY HUSBAND
FOR DINNER.

34:53.331 --> 34:55.366
WE'LL DISCUSS THE PHOTOS
BACK AT THE OFFICE.
SOUNDS GOOD.

34:55.366 --> 34:56.734
BYE. BYE.
BYE.

34:59.937 --> 35:01.806
WHAT'S GOING ON?

35:01.806 --> 35:03.975
I JUST --
I THINK I'M GOING CRAZY.

35:03.975 --> 35:06.010
I MEAN...

35:09.380 --> 35:11.182
I GOT IT
OFF YOUR CAMERA.

35:16.053 --> 35:18.456
WHY DIDN'T YOU
SAY SOMETHING?

35:18.456 --> 35:20.458
JUST ANSWER ME.

35:25.963 --> 35:28.232
ARE YOU HAVING AN AFFAIR?

35:30.134 --> 35:33.004
NO.

35:33.004 --> 35:35.106
NO.
THIS IS A TEST SHOT.

35:35.106 --> 35:36.941
OF WHAT?

35:36.941 --> 35:39.210
FOR THIS...SERIES
OF SELF-PORTRAITS

35:39.210 --> 35:41.212
THAT I'VE BEEN
THINKING ABOUT.

35:41.212 --> 35:44.182
IT'S, LIKE, UH, STAGED SCENES,
LIKE CINDY SHERMAN.

35:44.182 --> 35:46.818
I TOOK IT A FEW DAYS AGO
AT THIS APARTMENT

35:46.818 --> 35:49.020
THAT THE MAGAZINE USED
FOR SHOOTS.

35:53.291 --> 35:59.030
THIS REFLECTION --
WHO'S THAT?

35:59.030 --> 36:02.767
THAT'S BILLY,
ONE OF THE INTERNS.

36:04.669 --> 36:07.071
I KNOW.
I'M NO CINDY SHERMAN, RIGHT?

36:09.473 --> 36:11.909
MAYBE
I<i> AM</i> GOING CRAZY.

36:11.909 --> 36:14.345
NO, IT'S
TOTALLY UNDERSTANDABLE.

36:14.345 --> 36:17.281
I -- JUST NEXT TIME
YOU THINK SOMETHING,
JUST ASK, OKAY?

36:17.281 --> 36:18.950
DON'T DWELL ON IT.

36:18.950 --> 36:21.519
YOU'RE RIGHT. YEAH.
YOU'RE RIGHT.

36:26.524 --> 36:28.226
WHAT'S THAT?

36:28.226 --> 36:34.165
OH, UM...OLLIE HAD A...
BLOODY NOSE THIS MORNING.

36:34.165 --> 36:35.833
OH.

36:37.235 --> 36:39.804
ALL RIGHT, WELL, I'VE GOT TO
GET BACK TO THE OFFICE,

36:39.804 --> 36:40.872
BUT I'LL SEE YOU LATER.

36:40.872 --> 36:42.206
ALL RIGHT?
SEE YOU AT HOME.

36:42.206 --> 36:43.808
YEAH.

36:43.808 --> 36:45.176
OKAY.
YEAH.

36:45.176 --> 36:46.510
ALL RIGHT. BYE.

36:51.782 --> 36:53.451
BYE. BYE.
BYE. BYE.

37:26.656 --> 37:28.491
WHAT?

37:28.491 --> 37:31.093
SORRY, I'VE BEEN HOME SICK.
WHY?

37:31.093 --> 37:33.129
CONFIRMATION FOR A HEARING?

37:33.129 --> 37:35.965
I DON'T HAVE A HEARING
SCHEDULED FOR TODAY.

37:35.965 --> 37:40.336
LAST ON THE DOCKET --
PEOPLE vs. THATCHER KARSTEN JR.

37:40.336 --> 37:41.370
IS EVERYONE PRESENT?

37:41.370 --> 37:42.805
YES, YOUR HONOR.
YES, YOUR HONOR.

37:42.805 --> 37:45.208
THE STATE HAS MADE A MOTION
TO DISMISS THE CASE.

37:45.208 --> 37:46.108
IS THAT CORRECT?

37:46.108 --> 37:47.543
THAT'S RIGHT,
YOUR HONOR.

37:47.543 --> 37:49.812
WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON?
WHY IS GOSS HERE?

37:49.812 --> 37:51.681
I BELIEVE
HE'S YOUR NEW BOSS.

37:51.681 --> 37:53.249
AND IS THERE ANY OBJECTION?

37:53.249 --> 37:55.218
NO, YOUR HONOR.
THE DEFENSE HAS NO OBJECTION.

37:55.218 --> 37:58.054
THEN, ON THE STATE'S MOTION,
AND WITHOUT OBJECTION,

37:58.054 --> 38:00.990
THE MATTER OF THE PEOPLE
vs. THATCHER KARSTEN JR.

38:00.990 --> 38:02.325
IS HEREBY DISMISSED.

38:08.164 --> 38:10.233
HE DID IT.

38:10.233 --> 38:11.567
HEY.
GREAT, HUH?

38:18.207 --> 38:19.542
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO SAY.

38:19.542 --> 38:20.877
IT'S OKAY.

38:20.877 --> 38:23.412
UH, I'M SORRY
FOR ALL THE THINGS I SAID.

38:23.412 --> 38:25.481
I WAS --
I WAS WAY OUT OF LINE.

38:25.481 --> 38:28.251
IT'S SOMETHING WE SHOULD HAVE
TALKED ABOUT A LONG TIME AGO.

38:29.685 --> 38:32.588
WELL DONE, JACK.
HEY.

38:34.156 --> 38:35.658
YOU DID IT.

38:35.658 --> 38:37.093
IT'S OVER.

38:37.093 --> 38:40.062
I TOLD YOU
IT'D BE OKAY.

38:40.062 --> 38:41.364
UH, I'LL MEET YOU
AT HOME.

38:41.364 --> 38:43.199
I HAVE TO FINALIZE SOME PAPERS
FOR T.J.'s RELEASE.

38:43.199 --> 38:45.968
CONGRATULATIONS.
OKAY, WELL, GET BACK SOON,
BECAUSE WE'RE CELEBRATING.

38:45.968 --> 38:47.703
RIGHT? EVERYONE,
TO THE RESTAURANT.

38:47.703 --> 38:49.472
YEAH, I'LL CALL BRANDY.

38:53.576 --> 38:54.877
I SAY
WE LEAVE HER ALONE.

38:54.877 --> 38:56.112
SHE'S LEARNED
HER LESSON.

38:56.112 --> 38:57.580
THE STORY'S
GOT A HAPPY ENDING.

38:57.580 --> 39:00.249
LET'S LEAVE IT AT THAT.
WHAT ABOUT THE FEDS?

39:00.249 --> 39:02.084
SHE DOESN'T KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT OUR OPERATION.

39:02.084 --> 39:03.152
SHE'S NO THREAT.

39:06.722 --> 39:08.591
YOU DID GOOD, JACK.

39:08.591 --> 39:10.693
NOW THAT IT'S OVER,
WE CAN GET BACK TO BUSINESS.

39:10.693 --> 39:13.396
WE'VE GOT A MEETING
WITH WESTLAKE CAPITAL

39:13.396 --> 39:15.932
AND LUNCH
AT THE BUILDERS ASSOCIATION.

39:15.932 --> 39:18.501
YOU COMING, DAD?
YEAH.

39:19.835 --> 39:21.971
JACK?

39:21.971 --> 39:23.372
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

39:23.372 --> 39:26.642
WHAT'S GOING ON?

39:26.642 --> 39:27.977
I QUIT.

39:27.977 --> 39:30.212
WHAT?

39:30.212 --> 39:32.014
WHAT DID YOU SAY?

39:32.014 --> 39:36.485
I QUIT, THATCHER.
I-I-I QUIT.

39:36.485 --> 39:38.020
YOU --
YOU MEAN THE CASE?

39:38.020 --> 39:39.488
THE CASE IS OVER,
JACK.

39:39.488 --> 39:41.757
I'M NOT WORKING
FOR YOU ANYMORE.

39:41.757 --> 39:44.160
I'M SORRY.

39:44.160 --> 39:47.029
I'M DONE.

40:29.338 --> 40:30.806
WHAT DID HE MEAN,
DAD?

40:30.806 --> 40:32.775
IS JACK NOT WORKING
FOR YOU ANYMORE?

40:32.775 --> 40:34.577
IT SOUNDED
LIKE HE SAID HE QUIT.

40:36.712 --> 40:39.215
NOBODY QUITS.

40:41.717 --> 40:44.754
YOU PULLED A FAST ONE,
DIDN'T YOU?

40:44.754 --> 40:46.522
KARSTEN WAY.

40:46.522 --> 40:47.690
THE EVIDENCE SPEAKS
FOR ITSELF,

40:47.690 --> 40:49.125
WHETHER YOU CHOOSE
TO BELIEVE IT OR NOT.

40:49.125 --> 40:50.960
HE'S RIGHT. LET IT GO.
EVIDENCE MY ASS.

40:50.960 --> 40:52.862
YOU DID SOMETHING,
AND WHEN I FIND OUT --

40:52.862 --> 40:54.463
YOU'LL WHAT?
YOU'LL COME AFTER ME?

40:54.463 --> 40:56.499
THERE'S NOTHING
TO FIND OUT.

40:56.499 --> 40:58.367
LISTEN
TO YOUR COLLEAGUE.

40:58.367 --> 41:01.037
IT'S OVER.

41:01.037 --> 41:04.407
LET'S JUST PUT THIS
BEHIND US, HMM?

41:08.778 --> 41:09.945
YOU HURT YOUR HAND.

41:11.247 --> 41:13.916
MR. McALLISTER?
MR. McALLISTER, A STATEMENT?

41:13.916 --> 41:15.818
IS IT TRUE
NEW EVIDENCE SURFACED,

41:15.818 --> 41:17.186
EXONERATING T.J. KARSTEN?

41:17.186 --> 41:19.422
HOWARD GOSS AND THE STATE'S
ATTORNEY'S DEPARTMENT

41:19.422 --> 41:21.323
HAVE ACTED
WITH ADMIRABLE TACT AND SPEED.

41:21.323 --> 41:24.193
COME ON.
WE DON'T NEED TO SEE THIS.

41:24.193 --> 41:28.264
THAT'S ALL.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
