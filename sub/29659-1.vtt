[man on radio] <i> There's some</i>
<i> scary stuff going on out there</i>
<i> with this drone thing.</i>

00:23.124 --> 00:26.258
<i> I mean, this is now</i>
<i> the third woman to go missing</i>
<i> inside of a month.</i>

00:26.260 --> 00:28.494
[man 2 on radio]
<i> In my book, three is too many.</i>

00:28.496 --> 00:30.629
[man 1] <i> That is a streak.</i>
<i> We have the info that</i>
<i> he's been using drones</i>

00:30.631 --> 00:33.499
<i> to spy on his victims</i>
<i> before he abducts them.</i>

00:33.501 --> 00:35.401
[man 2]
<i> And they're all redheads, righ?</i>

00:35.403 --> 00:37.102
[man 1]
<i> Yeah, which is super sick.</i>

00:37.104 --> 00:38.670
<i> I'll tell you this much--</i>
<i> If I was a redheaded woman,</i>

00:38.672 --> 00:41.473
<i> I'd be dyeing my hair</i>
<i> and I'd be dressing like a man.</i>

00:41.475 --> 00:43.509
[man 2] <i> These Peeping Toms</i>
<i> are the worst.</i>

00:43.511 --> 00:46.645
<i> Drones were created</i>
<i> to keep people safe.</i>

00:46.647 --> 00:49.681
<i> How are the girls themselves</i>
<i> not aware of this?</i>

00:49.683 --> 00:52.818
<i> The drone comes</i>

00:57.058 --> 00:58.657
<i> Stay alive out there.</i>

01:38.532 --> 01:40.265
Welcome home.

01:47.475 --> 01:49.441
Let's see what we got.

02:00.321 --> 02:02.321
[snorting]

02:08.395 --> 02:10.729
Just... beautiful.

02:20.374 --> 02:22.674
Oh, you'll do just fine.

02:23.577 --> 02:25.577
But you're still not her.

02:26.413 --> 02:28.680
[banging on door]

02:38.792 --> 02:41.426
They found me. Oh, man.

02:42.897 --> 02:45.430
Fuck! I need to call an Uber.

03:10.357 --> 03:11.490
Move it!

03:12.593 --> 03:13.825
Over there.

03:14.628 --> 03:16.495
Okay, everyone, it's a dry hole.

03:18.766 --> 03:20.732
What is it, the maid's day off?

03:25.406 --> 03:27.439
[police radio chatter]

03:27.441 --> 03:29.341
[officer] We gotta get
this son of a bitch.

03:30.544 --> 03:32.711
Fire escape. It's all clear.

03:35.549 --> 03:37.349
[officer 2] Yeah, fuck you too.

03:38.852 --> 03:40.619
Oh, shit.

03:42.556 --> 03:43.956
Oh, man.

03:43.958 --> 03:46.992
Looks like she swiped right
on the wrong guy.

03:59.506 --> 04:00.906
Move, pig!

04:03.477 --> 04:05.444
[choking]

04:05.446 --> 04:07.446
[officer] Go, go, go, go!
[shouting]

04:11.485 --> 04:12.684
Shit!

04:23.330 --> 04:25.430
[helicopter approaching]

04:25.432 --> 04:26.498
Freeze!

04:26.500 --> 04:27.799
Give it up, Ramsey.

04:28.969 --> 04:30.636
You got nowhere to go.

04:34.742 --> 04:36.775
No, I'm not finished!

04:38.345 --> 04:40.445
You haven't seen the last of me.

04:40.848 --> 04:43.515
Zero, zero, one,

04:43.517 --> 04:45.651
zero, one, zero...

04:45.653 --> 04:47.452
What the hell's he doing?

04:47.454 --> 04:48.954
Sounds like binary.

[thunderclap]

04:54.895 --> 04:56.662
No!

04:57.398 --> 04:59.731
This is not how it ends!

05:10.944 --> 05:14.613
[officer] Well, buddy,
your days of raping
and murdering are over.

05:21.355 --> 05:23.522
[sirens blaring]

05:32.933 --> 05:35.634
Detective. Bagged and tagged.

05:37.504 --> 05:39.805
My kid's been begging me
for one of these.

05:42.076 --> 05:44.876
I'll be home in about...
an hour.

05:44.878 --> 05:47.412
[child on phone]
<i> Daddy, you said 8:30.</i>

05:47.414 --> 05:49.514
I know.
I had to make another pickup,

05:49.516 --> 05:51.817
but don't worry,
I'm about to drop it off.

05:52.753 --> 05:54.753
Daddy's sorry. Again.

05:56.023 --> 05:58.457
Mmm. You heard of The Violator?

05:58.459 --> 05:59.825
<i> Yes, Daddy.</i>

05:59.827 --> 06:03.662
<i> He's the one you told me about</i>
<i> who films girls,</i>

06:03.664 --> 06:05.931
<i> and then he hits them</i>
<i> on the head</i>

06:05.933 --> 06:07.833
<i> and brings them to his house</i>

06:07.835 --> 06:10.469
<i> and takes off all their clothe.</i>

06:10.471 --> 06:11.937
<i> -And then...</i>
-Yep, him.

06:11.939 --> 06:14.873
Well, the only thing
he's gonna be spying on tonight

06:14.875 --> 06:16.808
is the inside of a body bag.

06:16.810 --> 06:18.610
<i> They killed him?</i>

06:18.612 --> 06:21.546
<i> Yay! I hope he rots in hell.</i>

06:21.548 --> 06:23.782
Oh, he will, baby. He will.

06:23.784 --> 06:26.852
<i> Mommy said he probably</i>
<i> couldn't even get it up.</i>

06:26.854 --> 06:28.520
-[chuckles]
-[chimes]

06:28.522 --> 06:31.423

06:31.425 --> 06:32.791
[tires squealing]

06:42.970 --> 06:45.904
<i> Daddy? Are you still there?</i>

06:46.840 --> 06:50.142
[upbeat music playing on radio]

06:59.553 --> 07:00.886
[woman] Chris?

07:12.633 --> 07:15.133
Oh! Careful with that, buddy.
We got high-quality camera gear
in there.

07:15.135 --> 07:17.969
Will you stop
carrying everything?
We're paying for this.

07:17.971 --> 07:21.673
Well, maybe I should be handling
the more important stuff myself.

07:21.675 --> 07:23.175
[squealing]

07:24.845 --> 07:26.445
Welcome home.

07:27.080 --> 07:28.613
-Mmm.
-Mm.

07:29.983 --> 07:33.185
-What room do I go in, huh?
-Anywhere but the kitchen.

07:33.187 --> 07:36.087
Oh! You're the one
who can't cook.
Well...

07:36.089 --> 07:37.856
-Put me down.
-All right.

07:39.626 --> 07:41.560
Did you smoke?
What?

07:41.562 --> 07:43.795
[stuttering] Moving's stressful.

07:43.797 --> 07:46.798
Maybe since we're moving
into a new house,
you could try quitting again?

07:46.800 --> 07:49.968
Nobody likes a quitter.
Where's my dog?
I need some love.

07:49.970 --> 07:52.037
Where's my dog?
Hector, come here, buddy.

07:52.039 --> 07:54.172
[whistling] Come here, buddy.
Hi!
Oh, no.

07:54.174 --> 07:56.942
Come on, come on!
Home sweet home, huh?

07:58.946 --> 08:00.745
Baby, this is amazing!

08:00.747 --> 08:02.814
The entire house is controlled
by a central security system.

08:03.550 --> 08:04.783
Great!

08:04.785 --> 08:06.852
No, seriously.
Even you'd be impressed.

08:08.689 --> 08:10.589
Boys and their toys.

08:13.494 --> 08:14.860
[gasps]

08:14.862 --> 08:17.095
Sorry. I didn't mean to
scare you or anything.

08:17.931 --> 08:19.865
I'm Corrine, from next door.
Oh.

08:20.267 --> 08:21.766
I'll go around.

08:22.803 --> 08:24.769
-Okay.
-[doorbell rings]

08:25.706 --> 08:27.038
-Hi!
-Hi.

08:27.040 --> 08:29.574
Hi, I'm Chris. Nice to meet you.

08:29.576 --> 08:33.044
Nice... to meet you.

08:33.046 --> 08:36.915
Wow. The place looks
so different
without any furniture in it.

08:36.917 --> 08:37.983
Come in.

08:37.985 --> 08:39.651
[mouthing] Wow.

08:40.854 --> 08:43.722
[Corrine] Um, I used to know
the guy that lived here before.

08:43.724 --> 08:46.258
I mean, he was all right.

08:46.260 --> 08:48.894
Wasn't hot
or anything like that.

08:48.896 --> 08:50.929
Are you guys married?

08:50.931 --> 08:52.964
Yes, hence the... ring.

08:52.966 --> 08:54.933
Ah, yeah. You look married.

08:54.935 --> 08:56.268
-How long?
-Ten months.

08:56.270 --> 08:58.036
Yeah. And a whole year
before that.

08:58.038 --> 09:00.038
-Mm.
-Ugh.

09:00.040 --> 09:02.140
You guys hardly know each other
at all.

09:02.142 --> 09:04.075
That's so nice.

09:04.077 --> 09:06.711
You barely even hate
each other yet.

09:06.713 --> 09:08.547
Don't worry. Give it time.

09:08.549 --> 09:09.981
-Ohh!
-Well, normally,

09:09.983 --> 09:12.317
when I hate someone
I can tell pretty immediately.

09:12.319 --> 09:14.219
Oh, I like that one.

09:14.221 --> 09:15.720
I know. Me too.

09:15.722 --> 09:17.255
That's why I married her.

09:17.257 --> 09:19.858
I'm just giving you guys shit
because I'm really bitter.

09:19.860 --> 09:23.728
You know, my ex turned out to be
a royal fucking nightmare.

09:23.730 --> 09:26.197
Oh.
Oh, so was mine.

09:26.199 --> 09:27.666
But it all worked out.

09:27.668 --> 09:29.968
Yeah.
Thanks to the restraining order.

09:29.970 --> 09:31.937
[both laugh]

09:31.939 --> 09:33.138
Anyway.

09:34.908 --> 09:36.908
So, I'm gonna go now, but, um...

09:36.910 --> 09:39.811
but just feel free to come by
whenever you like.

09:40.213 --> 09:41.613
I really mean that.

09:41.615 --> 09:42.781
Will do.

09:43.684 --> 09:44.916
You can come too.

09:44.918 --> 09:46.151
Ohh!

09:48.822 --> 09:50.188
I can come too!

10:06.640 --> 10:08.340
[whirring]

10:19.086 --> 10:20.385
[barks]

10:20.387 --> 10:21.853
[whimpering]

10:21.855 --> 10:23.355
[Chris] What's up, buddy?
You gotta go?

10:23.357 --> 10:24.689
Come on.

10:26.860 --> 10:28.326
Whoa. Easy, bud. Easy.

10:28.328 --> 10:30.195
What the hell
are you barking at?

10:30.197 --> 10:31.997
[Hector barking]

10:34.968 --> 10:36.668
What do we have here?

10:40.007 --> 10:41.272
[barks]

10:51.952 --> 10:53.018
Yeah, baby.

10:53.020 --> 10:54.986
It's looking good in here.

10:54.988 --> 10:57.155
Make sure and leave
a little space for me.

10:57.157 --> 10:58.990
Oh, there's plenty of room.

10:58.992 --> 11:00.992
Well, you'll never gonna guess
what I just found in the trash.

11:00.994 --> 11:02.827
Louboutin shoes.

11:02.829 --> 11:04.729
Close! A drone.

11:05.132 --> 11:06.698
Ahh.

11:07.834 --> 11:09.401
Don't you already have
one of those?

11:09.403 --> 11:11.436
That little old toy one I have?
It's ancient.

11:11.438 --> 11:13.204
It's like three years old.
It barely flies.

11:13.206 --> 11:15.407
You have no idea how much cooler
these things have gotten.

11:17.310 --> 11:19.110
Oh, wait.
You know what? Hold on.

11:19.112 --> 11:21.346
I will... show you.

11:22.449 --> 11:24.215
You tell me.
[sighs]

11:28.055 --> 11:29.621
Huh?

11:29.622 --> 11:31.188
-Ah, do I have to have
an opinion on this?
-Yes.

11:31.191 --> 11:34.259
You know that probably belongs
to somebody
in the neighborhood, right?

11:34.261 --> 11:36.695
[sighs] You're right.

11:37.330 --> 11:38.930
I should go knocking
door-to-door.

11:39.733 --> 11:40.965
Where should I start first?

11:40.967 --> 11:42.467
Oh! There's that MILF next door.

11:42.469 --> 11:44.002
Oh, okay. You know what? Fine.

11:44.004 --> 11:45.870
You want it so badly,
go ahead and keep it.

11:45.872 --> 11:48.406
But if some kid comes by
asking for it,
I'm not lying for you.

11:48.408 --> 11:51.743
Baby, since when do I need you
to do my lying for me?

11:54.715 --> 11:58.950
So I just moved,
and for the life of me,
I can't find my drone's remote.

11:58.952 --> 12:00.351
Ugh, sucks.

12:00.353 --> 12:02.220
You think you have another one
in stock anywhere?

12:02.222 --> 12:04.422
Yeah, let me look.

12:04.424 --> 12:06.391
You got the advanced
or professional model?

12:06.393 --> 12:10.962
Uh, well, it's... the-- [huffs]
What's the difference again?

12:10.964 --> 12:13.098
The price, mostly. Let me see.

12:14.868 --> 12:18.470
Advanced.
All right, so...
drone replacement.

12:18.472 --> 12:19.771
Ah.

12:20.240 --> 12:21.406
White or black?

12:23.143 --> 12:25.910
Remote. White or black?

12:25.912 --> 12:28.346
I'm sure they're equal.
[laughing]
I'm just messing with you.

12:28.348 --> 12:30.115
[laughs]
They only come in white.

12:30.117 --> 12:32.150
They only come in white.
I'd have taken the black.

12:32.152 --> 12:34.085
Yeah, I'm sure you would've.

12:34.087 --> 12:35.453
[clears throat]

12:38.859 --> 12:40.024
Ooh!

12:40.427 --> 12:41.826
Oh, oh, oh.

12:41.828 --> 12:44.929
We have liftoff!

12:44.931 --> 12:46.030
[barking]

12:46.032 --> 12:47.932
Shut up, Hector.

12:47.934 --> 12:49.067
Geez.

12:50.971 --> 12:53.838
[woman] How high can it go?
[Chris] Legally? 400 feet.

12:54.975 --> 12:56.441
Feel like breaking the law?

12:57.210 --> 12:58.510
I think you're doing just fine.

12:58.512 --> 13:00.378
No, sweetie, here. Take it.
No, no, no.

13:00.380 --> 13:02.881
-This is awesome.
Here, just take it.
-No, I don't want to.

13:02.883 --> 13:04.015
Please.

13:07.020 --> 13:09.454
-Oh, shit!
Get away from the house.
-I'm trying to go straight up.

13:09.456 --> 13:11.790
[arguing]

13:11.792 --> 13:13.124
Oh.

13:13.126 --> 13:14.926
Ooh, I think we got
a little something here.

13:14.928 --> 13:16.227
A lover's quarrel.

13:16.229 --> 13:18.062
Uh, I don't think
we should be doing this.

13:18.064 --> 13:20.064
Why not?
'Cause we're invading
their privacy.

13:20.066 --> 13:21.533
That's the point.

13:21.535 --> 13:23.468
It's a drone.

13:23.470 --> 13:25.870
I knew there was a reason
you wanted to keep this thing.

13:27.107 --> 13:29.808
Oh, snap! Oh, my God.

13:30.811 --> 13:32.277
[gasps] Oh, shit.
Get it away from the window.

13:32.279 --> 13:34.112
-I'm trying, I'm trying.
-Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

13:34.114 --> 13:36.080
-Shit, shit!
-[Chris] Damn it!

13:37.083 --> 13:38.149
Sh...

13:38.151 --> 13:40.285
[laughs]

13:42.322 --> 13:45.423
[both squealing]

13:45.425 --> 13:48.293
Ooh, I'm gonna get
really aggressive with you
if that's okay.

13:48.295 --> 13:50.962
Oh, go for it.

13:50.964 --> 13:53.565
I'm gonna shake my finger
in your face,
and then I want you to punch me.

13:53.567 --> 13:57.368
Ooh, you don't even have to ask.
I don't even remember
your safe word.

-Like, a fire?

14:32.038 --> 14:35.506
Ooh-whoo!

14:35.508 --> 14:38.943
Whoo-hoo-hoo, my baby.
Good morning, sunshine.

14:38.945 --> 14:40.245
Aww!

14:41.147 --> 14:42.914
Oh, my goodness.

14:42.916 --> 14:45.149
I could get used to this.
Mm-hmm.

14:45.151 --> 14:47.018
Maybe not this.

14:47.487 --> 14:48.953
Well, the blowtorch works.

15:16.683 --> 15:18.483
I don't know
what you're talking about,

15:18.485 --> 15:20.351
but by the look on your face,
I bet it was hilarious.

15:20.353 --> 15:22.987
You can't fly these
in the house. It's dangerous.

15:22.989 --> 15:26.024
I haven't touched that thing
today, babe.
Well, it didn't fly by itself.

15:27.060 --> 15:29.294
It's a new house.
Sometimes stuff flies around.

15:30.163 --> 15:31.996
You're such an asshole.

15:32.632 --> 15:34.299
You know, maybe next time

15:34.301 --> 15:36.200
you should invite me
into the shower to protect you.

You're oozing sex.

16:07.968 --> 16:09.534
I love it.
You're looking beautiful.

16:09.536 --> 16:12.403
Why don't you play with her hair
maybe a little bit.

16:12.973 --> 16:14.205
Okay.

16:15.075 --> 16:16.641
Hold that, please.

16:16.643 --> 16:19.644
[clears throat] Hello?
Hey, baby. Everything okay?

16:19.646 --> 16:22.547
No. Your drone just turned on
and scared the shit out of me.

16:23.750 --> 16:26.117
I'm sorry. Why don't you just,
uh, turn it off then?

16:26.119 --> 16:27.318
Yeah? How?

16:27.320 --> 16:28.987

I'm controlling the drone?
I'm miles away. I'm at work.

-Yeah, he's at work.

What was that?
All good.

19:08.281 --> 19:10.348
I was setting up our new
fancy security system,

19:10.350 --> 19:12.316

that it was armed.

19:12.318 --> 19:14.452
The front door, anyway.

19:14.454 --> 19:17.788
Next I'm gonna set up
the windows. And, baby,
with this new software update,

19:17.790 --> 19:21.425
we can control the lights,
the temperature, the Wi-Fi,

19:21.427 --> 19:23.294

19:34.741 --> 19:38.409
Yeah. Speaking of that,

19:38.411 --> 19:40.711
I found my little guy here
out on the front steps.

19:40.713 --> 19:42.246
Would you know anything
about that?

19:42.248 --> 19:43.581
Are you serious?

19:44.484 --> 19:46.417
Keep that thing away from me.

right now?

At what?

21:56.516 --> 21:59.650
I don't know, babe. He's a dog.
Maybe he wants you
to unpack your boxes.

23:13.626 --> 23:15.025
we should have Corrine over
for dinner tonight.

23:15.027 --> 23:16.427
Who?

23:16.429 --> 23:17.895
You know Corrine,
from next door.

23:17.897 --> 23:19.563
Just to be, uh, neighborly.

23:19.999 --> 23:21.932
Oh. Sure.

23:21.934 --> 23:24.402
But, uh,
I thought we didn't like her.

23:24.404 --> 23:26.537
I don't know.
Maybe just give her a chance.

toy monster truck thing.

28:59.505 --> 29:01.472

Right.

29:01.474 --> 29:02.940
So-- [clears throat]

29:04.043 --> 29:05.809

this gag gift

29:05.811 --> 29:07.444
for her birthday,

29:07.446 --> 29:11.048
and she's out, you know,
test driving it
around the block.

and she accidentally
cuts off a car.

29:41.046 --> 29:42.146

29:43.883 --> 29:45.382
Yeah, so, anyway,
ever since then,

29:45.384 --> 29:48.252
she sort of just hated anything
with a remote control.

It's okay.

30:45.110 --> 30:46.310
Okay?

30:49.381 --> 30:50.547
All right.

31:03.362 --> 31:05.062
Oh, please don't touch me.

31:06.065 --> 31:07.564

I don't know, babe.

34:02.174 --> 34:04.107
Maybe he was chasing
a raccoon or something.

34:04.109 --> 34:06.176
Yeah, or something.

34:06.178 --> 34:08.345

34:13.085 --> 34:15.218
That's what he was barking at.
I know it.

34:15.220 --> 34:17.287
He hated that thing
even more than I do.

34:17.289 --> 34:18.789
Look, this was awful.

34:18.791 --> 34:21.458
I never should have let you
put him out there.

34:21.460 --> 34:23.527

Chris, I'm telling you,

36:39.965 --> 36:41.731
the drone was trying
to communicate with me.

36:41.733 --> 36:42.866
It was operating the TV.

36:42.868 --> 36:45.468
Wait. Now the TV is in on this?

36:45.470 --> 36:47.737
You're not listening to me,

36:47.739 --> 36:50.507
Baby, have you been
drinking tonight?
Chris, I'm not drunk!

36:50.509 --> 36:51.841
And I'm not insane.

36:51.843 --> 36:53.710
Okay? I saw it.

36:53.712 --> 36:56.379
I saw it take words
from people's mouths
to form this message

36:56.381 --> 36:58.915
and then lightning struck
and the TV turned white.

37:03.388 --> 37:04.521
The drone did this?

37:04.522 --> 37:05.655
I'm starting to think
you didn't even take
those pictures.

37:07.359 --> 37:08.858

37:10.395 --> 37:11.628
Whoa.

Jesus, babe.
Why didn't you tell me
about this?

I thought
you didn't want me to know.

37:18.704 --> 37:20.437
I didn't do this.

37:20.439 --> 37:22.439
Maybe they were taken
by the drone's
previous owner.

37:22.441 --> 37:24.341
No. These pics are dated.

37:24.343 --> 37:26.943
The drone put this

37:35.254 --> 37:37.020
The drone moves around

then it's there.

37:42.527 --> 37:44.027

37:49.668 --> 37:51.434
there's something wrong
with this.

37:51.436 --> 37:54.738
This didn't come with the drone,
you know. It...

37:54.740 --> 37:57.974
Oh, wait, no.
Maybe the drone is reacting
to a different controller.

37:57.976 --> 38:00.610
No, this is more than just
a wrong controller, Chris.

38:00.612 --> 38:01.711
Listen...

38:02.547 --> 38:03.913
Maybe whoever bought the drone

38:03.915 --> 38:05.448
still has the controller,

38:05.450 --> 38:07.384
probably lives
in the neighborhood,

38:07.386 --> 38:09.419

40:03.969 --> 40:06.770

You have any, like,
random signals

that might have
interfered with the drone?

40:13.011 --> 40:14.711
You know what?

40:14.713 --> 40:16.780
Last night
our security system went
totally haywire.

40:16.782 --> 40:18.448
Oh, see? That'll do it.

40:18.450 --> 40:20.116
Probably some stray signal
from your security system

40:20.118 --> 40:22.051
got into the drone and then--
[making robotic noises]

40:22.053 --> 40:23.820
and then that's... that's it.

40:23.822 --> 40:26.556

can I see the remote?

your remote is not paired

What happened to your face?

45:40.305 --> 45:41.838
Uh, nothing.

45:41.840 --> 45:43.172
But what is this?

45:43.174 --> 45:45.208
Aren't you guys
canvassing the neighborhood?

45:47.278 --> 45:49.812
Don't say anything else to them.

45:49.814 --> 45:51.447
Well, if you don't want
to talk here,

45:51.449 --> 45:54.250
maybe you wouldn't mind
coming down to the station
with us.

45:54.986 --> 45:56.486
Okay, wait a minute.

45:56.488 --> 45:58.087
Am I under arrest?

45:58.089 --> 46:00.089
[Ramirez] Not yet.

46:00.091 --> 46:02.158
But it'd be really helpful
if you came in.

46:07.265 --> 46:10.967
Gentlemen, if you think
that I had anything to do

46:10.969 --> 46:13.236
with whatever happened
with Corrine, you are...

46:13.238 --> 46:16.172
Like my partner said,
it'd be a big help.

46:20.078 --> 46:23.179
Okay. Yeah, fine.
If it would be a big help.

46:23.181 --> 46:24.480
I'll meet you there.

46:27.385 --> 46:28.851
[Allen] Let's go.

46:29.420 --> 46:30.987
[Chris] Okay.
[Allen] Left.

46:32.123 --> 46:34.257
I'm glad
we'll get a chance to talk.

47:00.185 --> 47:01.984
[Ramirez]
So you're a photographer, yeah?

47:02.887 --> 47:04.020
I am.

47:07.025 --> 47:08.524
What do you think of these?

47:11.329 --> 47:12.962
[Chris]
What am I looking at here?

47:12.964 --> 47:15.031
Oh, you're looking
at 20 to life.

47:18.102 --> 47:20.336
I don't... I don't know
anything about these pictures.

47:21.072 --> 47:23.105
You've never seen them before?

47:28.479 --> 47:30.179
Should I call my attorney?

47:30.181 --> 47:32.215
I don't know.

47:32.217 --> 47:34.951
I don't know.
That's when things start
to get messy.

47:36.154 --> 47:38.621
We can keep it
nice and clean for you, but...

47:39.557 --> 47:41.290
you gotta play it right.

47:42.026 --> 47:43.559
Okay, but...

47:45.029 --> 47:46.863
I didn't take these pictures.

47:46.865 --> 47:49.465
But you did e-mail them
to the station.

47:50.301 --> 47:51.500
What? No.

47:51.502 --> 47:52.568
No!

47:52.570 --> 47:54.337
This isn't your account?

47:54.339 --> 47:59.075
C_Howard_Photography@gmail.com?

48:01.012 --> 48:02.345
Yeah, that's me.

48:02.347 --> 48:05.548
Right. Well, last night
at around 3:15 a.m.,

48:06.251 --> 48:08.484
your e-mail sent us pictures

48:08.486 --> 48:10.152
of your half-naked neighbor

48:10.154 --> 48:12.588
along with an address
and a brief message.

48:12.590 --> 48:13.923
What was it?

48:13.925 --> 48:15.625
Oh, yes. "I like to watch."

48:17.929 --> 48:20.162
And that's... that's creepy.

48:20.164 --> 48:22.331
-It's mad creepy.
-[Ramirez] It's creepy, right?

48:22.333 --> 48:25.167
[Allen] Creepy enough for us
to pay a visit to her place
this morning.

48:25.169 --> 48:27.603
Well, you know
the rest of the story.

48:31.242 --> 48:33.075
Okay, gentlemen.

48:33.077 --> 48:37.280
Um... let's say
I did take these pictures.

48:37.282 --> 48:39.482
Which I didn't. Okay?

48:39.484 --> 48:44.320
Um, what possible motive
would I have to then send them
to the police?

48:46.391 --> 48:47.690
Maybe your wife sent them.

48:52.630 --> 48:54.931
My wife didn't send
these pictures.

48:56.701 --> 48:58.000
It...

49:00.438 --> 49:02.338
Who sent them, Mr. Howard?

49:05.710 --> 49:07.443
It was the drone!

49:07.445 --> 49:09.645
Detective Ramirez, please.

49:09.647 --> 49:12.148
Where is my husband?
I gotta speak to him.

49:12.150 --> 49:13.649
Your husband is being held
overnight.

49:13.651 --> 49:15.985
For what? He didn't do anything.

49:15.987 --> 49:18.654
Maybe. You were saying
something about a drone?

49:18.656 --> 49:22.625
Yes! Yes, we just got this drone
and it's been acting weird
since day one.

49:22.627 --> 49:25.094
First it was just little things,
like flying around the house.

49:25.096 --> 49:26.963
But now it's trying
to get rid of Chris.

49:27.732 --> 49:30.700
Are you on medication right now?
Oh, my God.

49:32.170 --> 49:33.402
Wha...

49:35.206 --> 49:36.305
[groans]

49:39.477 --> 49:41.143
[whirring]

49:48.186 --> 49:51.320
[ballad music playing]

49:52.223 --> 49:56.459
[woman]
¶ <i> Here I am</i>  ¶

49:57.395 --> 50:01.130
¶ <i> Dreaming of you</i>  ¶

50:02.266 --> 50:06.535
¶ <i> Wouldn't you be</i>
<i> My dream come-- </i> ¶

50:42.740 --> 50:45.341
Come out and play,
you son of a bitch.

50:51.382 --> 50:52.581
Shit!

51:21.479 --> 51:23.145
[whirring]

51:23.815 --> 51:25.347
[yells]

51:31.222 --> 51:32.488
No!

51:53.211 --> 51:55.177
[screams]

52:13.764 --> 52:15.331
Fucking die!

52:28.412 --> 52:30.246
Wait. You did what?

52:30.248 --> 52:32.481
I can't believe
you went back there by yourself.

52:32.483 --> 52:34.416
This thing might have
killed Corrine.

52:34.418 --> 52:35.718
I killed it.

52:35.720 --> 52:37.453
At least, I think I did.

52:39.190 --> 52:41.190
-What do you mean
you think you did?
-I don't know, Chris.

52:41.192 --> 52:43.192
I didn't exactly stick around
for the burial service.

52:43.194 --> 52:45.861
-I spent the night in a motel.
-With the drone?

52:45.863 --> 52:48.664
What? No. Not with the drone.
Are you even listening to me?

52:48.666 --> 52:49.899
Okay, okay. All right.

52:49.901 --> 52:51.367
[Rachel scoffs]

52:51.369 --> 52:52.735
The important thing is
that you're okay.

52:52.737 --> 52:54.837
But if you really killed
this thing,

52:54.839 --> 52:57.506
how are we supposed to prove
to the police
it was alive in the first place?

52:57.508 --> 52:58.941
I thought you'd be happy.

52:58.943 --> 53:01.677
I'm happy! I'm happy.
I'm also accused of murder.

53:01.679 --> 53:05.548
So, if we're going to turn in
a busted pile of propellers
to the police,

53:05.550 --> 53:08.384
then I'm not so sure
that helps my case.

53:08.386 --> 53:10.452
They're not going to
believe us anyway, Chris.

53:10.454 --> 53:12.388
Let's just give them
what's left of the drone,

53:12.390 --> 53:15.324
and they'll have some
forensic specialist
figure it out.

53:18.729 --> 53:20.496
Uh-huh.

53:26.470 --> 53:27.903
[Rachel] It was right over here.

53:28.573 --> 53:29.939
Where is it?
Oh, no.

53:32.810 --> 53:34.243
[sighs]

53:35.246 --> 53:36.345
No.

53:37.415 --> 53:40.416
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.

54:01.839 --> 54:02.972
It's gone.

54:05.810 --> 54:07.243
Is it?

54:10.481 --> 54:11.747
Afternoon.

54:11.749 --> 54:13.716
Dominic. Dominic Baker.

54:13.718 --> 54:15.751
Investigation Services.
Nice to meet you.

54:15.753 --> 54:17.286
I'm Chris. My wife, Rachel.

54:17.288 --> 54:18.587
Hi.
Hi.

54:18.589 --> 54:21.023
So, what is it
that needs to get done here?

54:21.993 --> 54:24.426
I know how it sounds...

54:25.496 --> 54:29.298
but our drone is trying
to kill us.

54:32.670 --> 54:35.571
Uh, excuse me?
What now is trying to kill you?

54:36.574 --> 54:37.706
Our drone.

54:38.943 --> 54:40.009
Yeah.

54:40.011 --> 54:42.444
You know, uh, a UAV.

54:42.446 --> 54:46.315
Yeah. Unmanned aerial vehicle.
I'm more familiar
with the military version,

54:46.317 --> 54:48.517
but now you're saying that
you got attacked by one?

54:48.519 --> 54:49.918
Yes.

54:49.920 --> 54:52.688
This was the commercial version.

54:53.524 --> 54:55.824
If you just hold
one second here.

54:56.494 --> 54:57.593
Hmm.

54:58.896 --> 55:00.462
Is that the culprit?

55:00.464 --> 55:01.897
[Rachel] Yeah. Yeah, that's it.

55:01.899 --> 55:04.800
Have you contacted
the manufacturer?

55:04.802 --> 55:06.935
We're telling the truth.
Chris is in real trouble.

55:06.937 --> 55:08.337
No, no. I understand.

55:08.339 --> 55:09.672
You're under investigation

55:09.674 --> 55:11.473
for the murder
of your next-door neighbor.

55:11.475 --> 55:13.409
Is it, uh, Corrine Caldwell?

55:13.411 --> 55:15.010
Yep. Um...

55:17.048 --> 55:18.881
I didn't do it.
The drone did.

55:19.483 --> 55:20.582
[clears throat]

55:21.886 --> 55:25.020
So, this drone, you say,
uh, attacked you two first

55:25.022 --> 55:27.423
and then killed your neighbor?

55:27.425 --> 55:28.624
And our dog.

55:29.894 --> 55:31.927
It wants to frame Chris.

55:31.929 --> 55:33.329
It's trying to kill us.

55:33.331 --> 55:35.664
[chuckles] Look.

55:35.666 --> 55:39.001
Sorry. I mean, I confess,
this is a new one for me, so...

55:39.970 --> 55:41.437
Well, the police
didn't believe us.

55:41.439 --> 55:43.505
We don't expect you to either.

55:43.507 --> 55:47.743
Really, all that we need
from you is to help us
find this... drone,

55:47.745 --> 55:49.778
so we can use it to...

55:50.781 --> 55:52.081
to clear my name.

55:56.954 --> 55:59.722
We searched the whole house.
This is all we found.

55:59.724 --> 56:01.090
This is hopeless. We're fucked.

56:01.092 --> 56:02.491
Oh, honey.

56:02.493 --> 56:03.859
We're not going to find
this thing

56:03.861 --> 56:05.427
unless it wants to be found.

56:05.429 --> 56:07.429
We got no receipt,
we got no box, no paperwork.

56:07.431 --> 56:09.031
We got nothing.

56:10.134 --> 56:11.633
We got a serial number.

56:14.872 --> 56:16.672
I'll find that bastard.

56:17.608 --> 56:19.842
Oh, uh, try not to worry.

56:19.844 --> 56:21.643
All right? Get some sleep.

56:21.645 --> 56:23.946
-You both look
like you need some.
-Thank you, Mr. Baker.

56:23.948 --> 56:25.514
I'll be in touch.

56:29.019 --> 56:30.552
[rustling]

56:30.554 --> 56:32.521
Babe, stop.
I'm not in the mood.

56:32.523 --> 56:33.889
[rustling continues]

56:33.891 --> 56:35.457
Chris, that tickles!

56:38.763 --> 56:40.062
Hon, did you say something?

56:44.602 --> 56:45.968

for this, asshole.

You think that's going
to stop that thing?

You think locking
the doors and windows

1:00:49.947 --> 1:00:51.813
is gonna make
the slightest bit of difference?

1:01:07.965 --> 1:01:09.665
[muttering]

1:01:09.667 --> 1:01:11.266
Oh, it's Baker.
Oh.

1:01:11.268 --> 1:01:12.934
Baker, how are you?

1:01:12.936 --> 1:01:15.103
Mr. Howard, how are things?

1:01:15.105 --> 1:01:16.872
Well, it's been quiet
since yesterday.

1:01:16.874 --> 1:01:19.441
Well, in some cases,
no news is good news.

1:01:19.443 --> 1:01:21.376
Do you have something for us?

1:01:21.378 --> 1:01:24.446
Well, I did talk to
a few friends of mine
who are a little more,

1:01:24.448 --> 1:01:26.415
shall we say, tech savvy.

1:01:26.417 --> 1:01:29.718
<i> Using the serial number,</i>
<i> we got an active GPS signal</i>
<i> on the drone.</i>

1:01:29.720 --> 1:01:31.153
That's great.

1:01:31.155 --> 1:01:33.188
Now, its history is
only been a couple weeks old,

1:01:33.190 --> 1:01:36.692
but most of that time has been
at or near your residence.

1:01:36.694 --> 1:01:39.194
-Before that,
it was in downtown.
-And now?

1:01:39.196 --> 1:01:41.363
GPS is not updating
in real time,

1:01:41.365 --> 1:01:45.133
but the most recent location
was, uh, Larchmont.

1:01:45.135 --> 1:01:47.436
It flew all the way to Larchmont
in the condition it's in?

1:01:47.438 --> 1:01:49.037
Yeah, apparently.

1:01:50.274 --> 1:01:54.743
It shows 80 Varick Street,
Unit 237, Larchmont.

1:01:54.745 --> 1:01:56.945
Does that address mean anything
to you?

1:01:57.281 --> 1:01:58.847
No.

1:01:58.849 --> 1:02:00.215
I'm gonna head out
in the morning first thing.

1:02:00.217 --> 1:02:02.784
-Check it out.
-Thank you. We appreciate that.

1:02:02.786 --> 1:02:03.852
Thank you.

1:02:03.854 --> 1:02:05.087
Try not to worry.

1:02:05.089 --> 1:02:07.022
We're gonna find
this damn drone.

1:02:08.025 --> 1:02:09.424
Get to the bottom of things.

1:02:31.048 --> 1:02:32.347
What the hell?

1:02:35.385 --> 1:02:37.152
[beeping rapidly]

1:02:40.924 --> 1:02:42.524
This can't be right.

1:02:44.428 --> 1:02:46.461
[beeping]

1:03:16.226 --> 1:03:17.793
[yelling]

1:03:28.205 --> 1:03:29.871
Ah, still no answer.

1:03:30.841 --> 1:03:32.974
We should have heard back
from him by now.

1:03:32.976 --> 1:03:36.111
I'm sure he has other cases,
baby. Why don't we just wait
till tonight.

1:03:36.113 --> 1:03:38.280
No. Something's wrong.
I can feel it.

1:03:39.049 --> 1:03:40.248
[cell phone whooshes]

1:03:40.250 --> 1:03:42.217
Oh, see? Here he is now.
It's a text.

1:03:42.886 --> 1:03:44.553
It's a pic.

1:03:45.422 --> 1:03:46.521
Oh, God.

1:03:47.391 --> 1:03:49.224
What is it?
Oh, God.

1:03:49.226 --> 1:03:51.126
-Oh, God.
-Ohh!

1:03:51.995 --> 1:03:53.094
Jesus.

1:03:54.598 --> 1:03:57.199
It knew.
It knew we were tracking it.

1:03:57.201 --> 1:03:58.567
I'm gonna throw up.

1:03:58.569 --> 1:04:00.202
There's no time for that.

1:04:00.204 --> 1:04:02.504
This thing is smarter
than we give it credit for.

1:04:02.506 --> 1:04:04.272
Come on.
We're going to Larchmont.

1:04:04.274 --> 1:04:05.607
What for?

1:04:05.609 --> 1:04:07.542
The drone went there
for a reason.

1:04:07.544 --> 1:04:09.978
Baker didn't get
to find out why.
We're going to.

1:04:09.980 --> 1:04:11.079
Come on.

1:04:38.375 --> 1:04:39.541
Is this it?

1:04:41.411 --> 1:04:43.311
[mocking] Excuse me, sir.

1:04:43.313 --> 1:04:46.648
By any chance,
have you recently been visited
by a killer drone?

1:04:46.650 --> 1:04:48.383
[normal voice]
This is so stupid.

1:04:48.385 --> 1:04:49.651
Come on. We're going in.

1:04:52.055 --> 1:04:53.421
All right, we tried.

1:05:03.467 --> 1:05:04.599
[Richie] What?

1:05:04.601 --> 1:05:06.635
-Hi.
-What can I do for you, hon?

1:05:07.504 --> 1:05:08.937
Hi, sir. [chuckles]

1:05:08.939 --> 1:05:10.605
Um-- [clears throat]

1:05:10.607 --> 1:05:13.642
Uh, well, this is going to sound
just really weird,

1:05:13.644 --> 1:05:16.144
and we're really sorry
to bother you,

1:05:16.146 --> 1:05:20.282
but any chance
you've been visited by a, uh...

1:05:20.284 --> 1:05:22.150
a drone recently?

1:05:23.086 --> 1:05:25.654
No. Not that I can think of.

1:05:25.656 --> 1:05:30.058
About yea big. It's all white,
it's got four propellers...

1:05:30.060 --> 1:05:32.160
[chuckles] Sounds like my dick.

1:05:33.130 --> 1:05:35.430
Um, are you sure
you haven't seen a drone?

1:05:35.432 --> 1:05:37.465
Pretty sure.
Anywhere?

1:05:37.467 --> 1:05:39.634
You want to come in
a minute?

1:05:39.636 --> 1:05:41.336
Take a look around?

1:05:41.338 --> 1:05:43.672
We don't want to put you out.
Yeah, actually. Thanks.

1:05:44.308 --> 1:05:45.674
Rach. Rachel.

1:05:46.443 --> 1:05:47.542
Sorry.

1:05:49.980 --> 1:05:51.546
Thank you for having us.

1:05:52.582 --> 1:05:54.316
Yeah.

1:05:54.318 --> 1:05:56.351
Are you a mechanic?

1:05:58.655 --> 1:05:59.955
No.

1:06:00.958 --> 1:06:02.223
Are you a model?

1:06:02.225 --> 1:06:04.125
Oh. [chuckles]
That's his department.

1:06:04.127 --> 1:06:05.961
He's the photographer.
Yeah.

1:06:08.231 --> 1:06:09.698
Uh, have you modeled?

1:06:09.700 --> 1:06:12.500
[clears throat] What about
this equipment here? Is...

1:06:12.502 --> 1:06:15.203
You fixing something or...?

1:06:15.205 --> 1:06:17.205
[Richie] Something like that.

1:06:17.207 --> 1:06:20.041
[Chris] Or just maybe
repairing something?

1:06:20.444 --> 1:06:21.543
[Richie] Maybe.

1:06:25.749 --> 1:06:27.048
Chris!

1:06:29.453 --> 1:06:31.319
Ramsey warned me about
you two motherfuckers!

1:06:31.321 --> 1:06:32.687
[box cutter clicks]
Now you're gonna die!

1:06:32.689 --> 1:06:35.023
Let him go! Let him go!

1:06:35.025 --> 1:06:37.459
[yelling]

1:06:41.298 --> 1:06:43.264
Ramsey always liked
the pretty ones.

1:06:43.734 --> 1:06:45.000
[Chris] Hey!

1:06:46.203 --> 1:06:48.136
Get your goddamn hands
off of her.

1:06:48.672 --> 1:06:50.205
[screaming]

1:06:53.510 --> 1:06:56.411
Look what you did to me,
you piece of shit!

1:06:56.413 --> 1:06:57.679
Get off me, bitch!

1:07:07.024 --> 1:07:08.289
[Chris] I think he's dead.

1:07:08.291 --> 1:07:11.559
So do I.
We should call the police.

1:07:11.561 --> 1:07:14.396
I'm enough trouble
with the police,
don't you think?

1:07:14.398 --> 1:07:17.232
But it was an accident.
He attacked us.
We are in his apartment.

1:07:17.234 --> 1:07:19.567
I wouldn't even know how
to explain
how the hell we got here.

1:07:19.569 --> 1:07:21.236
Go. Come on. Go.

1:07:25.208 --> 1:07:26.574
I know who it is.

1:07:27.477 --> 1:07:29.711
What are you talking about?
The drone.

1:07:31.048 --> 1:07:32.280
It's Ramsey.

1:07:33.050 --> 1:07:34.215
Wait a minute. Ramsey?

1:07:34.217 --> 1:07:36.151
Like, your ex, Ramsey?
The pervert?

1:07:36.153 --> 1:07:38.420
He's the drone.
It all makes sense now.

1:07:38.422 --> 1:07:40.522
Wait. You're telling me
that your ex-boyfriend

1:07:40.524 --> 1:07:43.358
is inside of a drone
and that all makes sense now?

1:07:44.461 --> 1:07:45.760
I don't fucking believe this.

1:07:45.762 --> 1:07:49.064
There's a reason
why it came to our house.

1:07:49.066 --> 1:07:51.533
This thing--
You didn't find it, it found us.

1:07:51.535 --> 1:07:54.302
That doesn't explain
how he's a drone.

1:07:54.304 --> 1:07:56.771
Ramsey was obsessed
with technology.

1:07:57.541 --> 1:08:00.341
He used to film us having sex.

1:08:02.212 --> 1:08:06.147
He would hack
into people's computers,
anyone who pissed him off.

1:08:06.149 --> 1:08:09.217
It makes sense that he would be
into drones now.

1:08:10.120 --> 1:08:11.252
Literally.

1:08:12.222 --> 1:08:14.422
I never thought
he'd become a killer.

1:08:15.525 --> 1:08:17.358
What the hell does he want?

1:08:20.464 --> 1:08:22.197
Same thing he's always wanted.

1:08:23.467 --> 1:08:24.566
Me.

1:08:26.369 --> 1:08:27.869
Pack a bag, we're leaving.

1:08:28.438 --> 1:08:29.604
[Rachel] What?

1:08:30.373 --> 1:08:32.474
They said you can't leave town.

1:08:32.476 --> 1:08:35.276
We just came from Larchmont.
Until we figure out
what happened to your ex,

1:08:35.278 --> 1:08:37.712
we're gonna
get the fuck out of town.
Now, come on.

1:08:46.690 --> 1:08:47.889
Chris?

1:09:02.739 --> 1:09:04.839
He's here. We gotta go now.

1:09:05.509 --> 1:09:07.609
[doorbell rings]

1:09:07.611 --> 1:09:09.244
Who the hell is this?

1:09:11.648 --> 1:09:13.481
Oh, shit. It's the cops.

1:09:13.483 --> 1:09:16.518
What? What are we gonna do?
They're here to arrest you.

1:09:16.520 --> 1:09:18.853
Just think.
I gotta think just for a minute.

1:09:18.855 --> 1:09:20.522
[knocking]

1:09:22.526 --> 1:09:24.459
What if they come in?
I have to tell them
about Ramsey.

1:09:24.461 --> 1:09:25.727
Think, think, think...

1:09:25.729 --> 1:09:27.262
[electronic voice]
<i> Door is unlocked.</i>

1:09:27.264 --> 1:09:28.463
[lock clicks]

1:09:29.466 --> 1:09:30.632
After you.

1:09:35.438 --> 1:09:36.738
Mr. Howard?

1:09:39.809 --> 1:09:41.543
Maybe they're not home.

1:09:41.545 --> 1:09:43.478
[Rachel] Don't come in here!

1:09:43.480 --> 1:09:46.214
Mrs. Howard, we have a warrant
for your husband's arrest.

1:09:46.216 --> 1:09:48.216
Be careful. It's in here.

1:09:48.685 --> 1:09:49.884
What's in here?

1:09:50.453 --> 1:09:51.819
[whirring]

1:09:51.821 --> 1:09:53.621
You hear that?

1:09:53.623 --> 1:09:55.223
What the hell is that?

1:09:55.225 --> 1:09:56.391
I don't know.

1:10:00.463 --> 1:10:01.863
Oh, my God.

1:10:17.314 --> 1:10:19.614
When I say go,
we make a run for it.

1:10:27.691 --> 1:10:29.424
No, no, no, no, no. No!

1:10:32.662 --> 1:10:34.662
I know it's you, Ramsey.

1:10:35.632 --> 1:10:38.766
I know you killed my dog.
And my neighbor.

1:10:38.768 --> 1:10:41.669
And tried to frame
my husband for her murder.

1:10:41.671 --> 1:10:43.871
What did you think
was going to happen, huh?

1:10:43.873 --> 1:10:45.707
Do you think I'd take you back?

1:10:45.709 --> 1:10:47.442
I'm with Chris now.

1:10:47.444 --> 1:10:49.911
Get that
through your fucking head.

1:10:54.317 --> 1:10:56.851
You just wanna ruin my life
all over again, don't you?

1:10:56.853 --> 1:10:58.853
Well, I know what you are.

1:10:58.855 --> 1:11:01.289
And I am not afraid of you!

1:11:01.291 --> 1:11:03.291
[whirring, cranking]

1:11:03.293 --> 1:11:04.792
Oh, shit.
Shit.

1:11:26.416 --> 1:11:28.383
[drone] <i> Now it's an even fight.</i>

1:11:29.019 --> 1:11:31.452
Man, I hate upgrades. Go!

1:11:33.823 --> 1:11:35.623
Go! It's not going to kill me.

1:11:35.625 --> 1:11:38.493
-Come on. I'm not leaving you!
-It wants me alive!

1:11:38.495 --> 1:11:39.594
Go!

1:11:39.963 --> 1:11:41.396
Go!

1:11:42.866 --> 1:11:45.667
<i> Did you really think</i>
<i> you could steal my girl?</i>

1:11:49.639 --> 1:11:52.807
<i> Where is your camera now,</i>
<i> Annie Leibovitz?</i>

1:12:07.457 --> 1:12:08.823
[whistles]

1:12:18.768 --> 1:12:20.468
<i> Really?</i>

1:12:20.470 --> 1:12:21.703
[Rachel]
Show me what you've got.

1:12:21.705 --> 1:12:22.970
<i> Give me a sec.</i>

1:12:39.589 --> 1:12:40.722
Chris!

1:12:47.597 --> 1:12:48.930
[drone cackling]

1:12:48.932 --> 1:12:51.699
<i> I hope you got</i>
<i> the extended warranty.</i>

1:13:00.744 --> 1:13:02.043
Brace the door.
What?

1:13:02.045 --> 1:13:04.412
It can open the doors remotely.
Brace it.

1:13:06.082 --> 1:13:08.049
<i> Let me in, you slut.</i>

1:13:08.051 --> 1:13:10.585
<i> I'm going to fucking kill</i>
<i> the both of you.</i>

1:13:10.587 --> 1:13:12.487
-[gasps]
<i> -Rachel.</i>

1:13:12.489 --> 1:13:15.022
<i> You know Chris can't touch you</i>
<i> the way that I can.</i>

1:13:18.895 --> 1:13:20.428
[clanking]

1:13:20.430 --> 1:13:22.697

1:13:39.916 --> 1:13:42.650
<i> Here's... Ramsey!</i>

1:13:45.855 --> 1:13:47.121
Where did it go?

1:13:50.460 --> 1:13:51.793
I have an idea.

1:13:51.795 --> 1:13:53.428
What are you doing?

1:13:55.965 --> 1:13:58.132
What the hell you gonna do
with that?

1:13:58.134 --> 1:13:59.600
I love you.

1:14:06.476 --> 1:14:08.876
<i> Don't fuck with technology.</i>

1:14:15.118 --> 1:14:16.651
Now!

1:14:17.153 --> 1:14:18.586
Hey, asshole.

1:14:18.588 --> 1:14:20.688
I declare this house
a no-fly zone.

1:14:20.690 --> 1:14:22.623
<i> No. No, no, no. No!</i>

1:14:22.625 --> 1:14:25.793
<i> No!</i>  [groans]

1:14:26.629 --> 1:14:28.529
<i> Ah, shit.</i>

1:14:34.170 --> 1:14:36.737
[both coughing]

1:14:52.188 --> 1:14:54.055
Now we should call 911.

1:14:55.492 --> 1:14:57.492
I think
they're already downstairs.

1:14:57.961 --> 1:15:00.228
[both laugh]

1:15:06.803 --> 1:15:08.669
I'm gonna get something
for my leg.

1:15:09.639 --> 1:15:11.739
Maybe you should
call an ambulance.

1:15:47.010 --> 1:15:49.644
[beeping]

1:15:58.154 --> 1:15:59.620
[electricity crackles]

1:16:03.026 --> 1:16:05.893
Yes, uh, we need an ambulance.

1:16:07.263 --> 1:16:09.564
Uh, my husband and I,
we were attacked.

1:16:31.721 --> 1:16:35.623
I'm at 420 Oak Lane.

1:16:37.961 --> 1:16:39.360
No, Lane.

1:16:40.897 --> 1:16:42.897
No, not Way, Lane.

1:16:42.899 --> 1:16:44.899
420 Oak Lane.

1:16:47.070 --> 1:16:48.202
Yeah.

1:16:51.674 --> 1:16:52.873
Rachel.

1:16:54.010 --> 1:16:55.142
Howard.

1:16:56.346 --> 1:16:57.678
Okay.

1:16:59.949 --> 1:17:01.115
Thank you.

1:17:03.219 --> 1:17:04.619
Okay.

1:17:13.196 --> 1:17:14.395
Chris.

1:17:15.064 --> 1:17:16.631
Now? Seriously?

1:17:19.302 --> 1:17:21.002
[grunts]

1:17:22.639 --> 1:17:23.838
[muffled]

1:17:28.277 --> 1:17:29.877
Oh, my God.

1:17:35.852 --> 1:17:38.653
That wasn't very nice of you
to douse me with paint thinner

1:17:38.655 --> 1:17:40.388
and light me on fire.

1:17:41.724 --> 1:17:43.090
Where's Chris?

1:17:44.227 --> 1:17:47.161
Chris won't be
coming between us anymore.

1:17:47.163 --> 1:17:49.930
Chris. If you're in there,
fight him.

1:17:49.932 --> 1:17:51.232
This isn't you.

1:17:51.868 --> 1:17:53.034
You're right.

1:17:55.338 --> 1:17:56.704
It's me.

1:17:58.241 --> 1:17:59.940
[yells]

1:18:01.010 --> 1:18:02.943
[gasping]

1:18:02.945 --> 1:18:05.146
It was all for you.

1:18:05.148 --> 1:18:08.049
No matter how many of them
I killed...

1:18:08.051 --> 1:18:10.851
they never brought me
any closer to you.

1:18:15.158 --> 1:18:16.891
What are you gonna do with that?

1:18:16.893 --> 1:18:18.759
It's not even plugged in.

1:18:20.396 --> 1:18:22.897
It is now, you son of a bitch.

1:18:22.899 --> 1:18:24.265
[yelling]

1:18:24.834 --> 1:18:26.300
You bitch!

1:18:30.006 --> 1:18:31.939
You think you can stop me?

1:18:34.143 --> 1:18:35.810
Now that I'm here...

1:18:36.979 --> 1:18:38.713
I can smell you,

1:18:38.715 --> 1:18:40.948
and I can taste you,

1:18:40.950 --> 1:18:42.349
and I can touch you.

1:18:43.486 --> 1:18:45.252
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.

1:18:45.254 --> 1:18:48.189
-There's one thing
you can't do anymore.
-What's that?

1:18:53.830 --> 1:18:56.163
[screams]

1:19:06.209 --> 1:19:07.308
Fly.

1:19:13.316 --> 1:19:14.415
[gasps]

1:19:16.919 --> 1:19:17.985
Rach.

1:19:17.987 --> 1:19:19.453
Are you okay?

1:19:26.028 --> 1:19:27.228
No.
