WEBVTT

00:00.917 --> 00:03.169
Legacies... You don't want me

00:03.211 --> 00:03.795
to point out all your friends

00:03.796 --> 00:07.298
have forgotten you ever existed.

00:07.340 --> 00:09.693
When I woke up from that
spell Josie blasted me with,

00:09.718 --> 00:11.678
you popped
into my messed-up brain

00:11.720 --> 00:13.638
like an acid flashback.

00:13.680 --> 00:15.348
Gonna tell everyone
that I was back.

00:15.390 --> 00:18.435
But then I saw Landon and Josie
and how happy they were.

00:18.476 --> 00:19.519
The monsters are back.

00:19.561 --> 00:21.438
I have no idea how or why

00:21.479 --> 00:23.356
or if it's gonna stop.

00:23.398 --> 00:26.151
Lizzie... she-she met this new vampire.
Sebastian?

00:26.192 --> 00:27.694
Who you talking to, man?

00:27.736 --> 00:29.863
Oh, yes. No, he can't see me.

00:29.904 --> 00:31.698
He wants for us to wake him up.

00:31.740 --> 00:34.242
What do you wish to know?
What kind of vamp you are.

00:34.284 --> 00:36.286
I fed on so many humans.

00:36.327 --> 00:38.621
The cobblestones...
They ran red with blood.

00:38.663 --> 00:39.748
Well, in that case...

00:41.458 --> 00:43.501
So you're name's Wade, then.
Who are you?

00:43.543 --> 00:44.586
A friend.

00:46.000 --> 00:52.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:05.482 --> 01:07.734
And how old are you claiming
to be?

01:07.776 --> 01:10.862
21... ish.

01:12.447 --> 01:15.408
Relax. It's called
"the Big Easy" for a reason.

01:17.160 --> 01:18.912
I'm Freya.

01:18.953 --> 01:21.289
I hear you've been asking
around the Quarter for me.

01:21.331 --> 01:23.291
I'm Josie.

01:23.333 --> 01:25.627
I'm a student
at the Salvatore School.

01:25.668 --> 01:27.754
Mystic Falls?
Yeah, I've heard of it.

01:27.796 --> 01:30.548
My wife's got an eye on it
for our son.

01:30.590 --> 01:32.967
I kind of need your help.

01:33.009 --> 01:36.554
There's this spell that I'm kind
of trying to reverse engineer.

01:36.596 --> 01:40.141
I'm sure one of your teachers
can help you with that.

01:40.183 --> 01:43.061
An ancient Japanese
black magic purge spell?

01:44.938 --> 01:46.648
Those aren't the kind of spells

01:46.689 --> 01:48.399
school kids should
be messing with.

01:49.651 --> 01:51.111
You should go home.

01:51.152 --> 01:53.530
Wait.

01:53.571 --> 01:55.657
You have photos in your home

01:55.698 --> 01:57.742
of someone you don't recognize.

01:57.784 --> 02:00.620
Feels like you should
know them, but you don't?

02:03.915 --> 02:05.834
How did you know that?

02:05.875 --> 02:08.044
We've all forgotten people.

02:08.086 --> 02:09.963
It doesn't matter what I say.

02:10.003 --> 02:11.398
The spell that I need
is the only way

02:11.422 --> 02:13.174
that you're gonna
remember for yourself.

02:16.678 --> 02:18.179
All right, now, on to our tour's

02:18.221 --> 02:20.682
final and most important stop...

02:20.723 --> 02:22.642
The front door.

02:22.684 --> 02:24.686
Use it to get back to
your hotel. Love you.

02:24.727 --> 02:26.729
Quit playing.
I came up for Commonwealth Day.

02:26.771 --> 02:28.356
Now show me the cool stuff.

02:28.398 --> 02:30.859
This is school. There's
nothing cool to see.

02:30.900 --> 02:32.628
It's a school for vampires,
witches and werewolves,

02:32.652 --> 02:33.712
so there's no way I'm leaving

02:33.736 --> 02:35.572
without seeing something
Harry Potter.

02:35.613 --> 02:36.990
Kym? Mm-hmm.

02:37.031 --> 02:39.117
For the last time, there
is nothing... to... see.

02:50.086 --> 02:52.839
Incendia!

02:52.881 --> 02:55.049
Lizzie, we have
to trap it so Malivore

02:55.091 --> 02:56.551
can't send another monster.

02:56.593 --> 02:58.428
Incinerating it kind of
defeats the purpose?

02:58.469 --> 03:00.722
Okay, fine.

03:00.763 --> 03:02.473
Glacies corporis.

03:08.479 --> 03:10.023
You were saying?

03:24.078 --> 03:25.705
Sheriff.

03:25.747 --> 03:28.625
Hey. Oh. So you can see me?

03:28.666 --> 03:31.628
I thought maybe I was invisible
after you ghosted me last week.

03:31.669 --> 03:33.504
Yeah, I'm-I'm really sorry
about that.

03:33.546 --> 03:35.191
You know, something came up
with my daughters.

03:35.215 --> 03:36.633
And I'm learning to let them go

03:36.674 --> 03:38.176
and figure things
out on their own.

03:38.218 --> 03:41.179
Just really suck at that.

03:41.221 --> 03:43.640
I know the feeling.

03:43.681 --> 03:45.034
- Uh, you know...
- All units, potential

03:45.058 --> 03:47.060
187 at Mystic Tap.
Please respond.

03:47.101 --> 03:48.645
I'm on it.

03:48.686 --> 03:50.980
Whatever you were about to say,
make sure the next time

03:51.022 --> 03:54.776
I give you a chance to say it,
you actually follow through.

03:56.694 --> 03:58.613
Ow!

03:58.655 --> 04:01.449
I have done that,
like, five times.

04:01.491 --> 04:03.493
Is it possible to die
from a paper cut?

04:03.534 --> 04:05.662
Careful. That's the
best arm in town now.

04:05.703 --> 04:07.664
Let me see.

04:09.332 --> 04:11.376
Yeah.

04:11.417 --> 04:12.794
It's fatal.

04:14.963 --> 04:17.589
Hey, you two, quit slacking.

04:17.632 --> 04:19.968
Tomorrow's festivities
will not be thrown off

04:20.009 --> 04:21.886
by hormonal teenagers.

04:21.928 --> 04:23.721
Sure thing, Councilman.

04:25.473 --> 04:28.351
Ruined by an old, white
guy politician, though?

04:28.393 --> 04:29.811
Totally plausible.

04:29.852 --> 04:31.247
How did that
guy win an election?

04:31.271 --> 04:33.106
Democracy...

04:33.147 --> 04:35.191
isn't what it used to be.

04:38.778 --> 04:41.739
Hey, I got to head to practice.

04:41.781 --> 04:42.949
But you're hurt.

04:42.991 --> 04:44.534
I can still help the team win.

04:44.575 --> 04:47.287
Gotcha. See you after?

04:47.328 --> 04:49.706
Not unless you're coming
to physical therapy with me.

04:49.747 --> 04:52.041
My life's a real party
these days.

04:54.335 --> 04:56.879
You ever want to see me,

04:56.921 --> 04:58.965
you should probably
just ask me out.

05:06.055 --> 05:09.100
Don't "gah" me. Get
your ass under here.

05:13.313 --> 05:15.606
What are you doing?

05:15.648 --> 05:17.191
Looking for you.
You were supposed

05:17.233 --> 05:19.402
to be keeping an eye
on the portal to Malivore.

05:19.444 --> 05:20.987
I'm literally on top of it.

05:21.029 --> 05:22.530
Not on top of it enough.

05:22.572 --> 05:24.741
A zombie snuck
onto campus this morning.

05:24.782 --> 05:26.343
I mean, are you sure
it's from the portal?

05:26.367 --> 05:28.161
I've been here all night.

05:28.202 --> 05:30.663
It has the mark of Malivore
carved into its skull.

05:30.705 --> 05:32.582
It's obviously from the portal.

05:32.623 --> 05:35.585
Maybe you were too busy
flirting with the muggle.

05:35.626 --> 05:38.421
I wasn't flirting.
I was blending in.

05:38.463 --> 05:40.173
Hey, by all means, flirt away.

05:40.214 --> 05:41.841
The faster you get over Landon,

05:41.883 --> 05:44.510
the sooner I can stop worrying
about Josie's happiness.

05:44.552 --> 05:47.430
We locked the zombie up,
which means no more portal duty

05:47.472 --> 05:50.892
is required, and you and I can
hang out today.

05:50.933 --> 05:52.477
Why is that last part harder

05:52.518 --> 05:54.437
for me to understand
than all the rest?

05:54.479 --> 05:55.938
If I spend any time with Josie,

05:55.980 --> 05:58.358
I will inevitably
blow your secret.

05:58.399 --> 06:00.234
You want to protect her
from heartbreak,

06:00.276 --> 06:01.861
you're stuck with me.

06:01.903 --> 06:03.571
Okay. Yeah.

06:09.410 --> 06:10.870
Um, Earth to Rafael.

06:10.912 --> 06:12.747
Phoenixes don't have
super strength.

06:12.789 --> 06:14.874
My-my bad. I'm-I'm distracted.

06:17.085 --> 06:19.170
Are Lizzie and Hope friends now?

06:20.171 --> 06:21.881
It is a problem.

06:21.923 --> 06:23.299
Look, I'll be lucky

06:23.341 --> 06:24.568
if Lizzie doesn't talk trash
about me, dude.

06:24.592 --> 06:26.803
Deserved trash. Earned trash.

06:26.844 --> 06:29.222
Sweaty, gym-sex trash.

06:30.640 --> 06:31.849
Sorry.

06:33.059 --> 06:34.519
You know what you need?

06:35.645 --> 06:38.940
A wingman. Oh, by-by which

06:38.981 --> 06:41.484
I pray you do not mean... Me.

06:41.526 --> 06:42.985
I can help run interference.

06:43.027 --> 06:44.654
You get in there,
make a move. Come on.

06:44.695 --> 06:46.495
Josie and I can use a couple
for double dates.

06:48.825 --> 06:50.284
You can thank me when it works.

06:51.285 --> 06:52.662
You will.

06:52.703 --> 06:54.122
Lift the table, man.

06:55.873 --> 06:58.751
Harae-tamai Kioku.

06:58.793 --> 07:02.547
Yomigaerashi-tamae.

07:02.588 --> 07:05.925
In the spell,
conviction matters.

07:05.967 --> 07:08.845
You need to be clear
of mind and purpose.

07:08.886 --> 07:10.471
If not, instead of

07:10.513 --> 07:13.266
purging the supernatural
influence in the mind,

07:13.307 --> 07:17.228
you'll end up solidifying it,
making it permanent.

07:17.270 --> 07:18.855
Is that as bad as it sounds?

07:18.896 --> 07:20.731
You'd erase the very memories

07:20.773 --> 07:22.316
you're trying to bring back.

07:22.358 --> 07:24.026
How did you

07:24.068 --> 07:26.279
even find this spell?

07:26.320 --> 07:30.950
I siphoned it from an ancient
sword to save my sister's life?

07:30.992 --> 07:34.036
Weird story short,
I read in this diary

07:34.078 --> 07:36.205
how it returned
all of her memories somehow.

07:36.247 --> 07:37.707
Hmm.

07:37.748 --> 07:40.334
Magic and privacy
don't mix well.

07:44.672 --> 07:46.799
That's my wife. She's on

07:46.841 --> 07:48.676
Nik duty tonight... our kid.

07:48.718 --> 07:50.094
Excuse me.

07:50.136 --> 07:51.471
Hey.

07:51.512 --> 07:53.473
Yup. Yeah, I'm still at the bar.

07:53.514 --> 07:55.475
How's Nik doing?

08:16.537 --> 08:18.873
Who is she?

08:20.291 --> 08:23.878
I knew you were
hiding something from me.

08:23.920 --> 08:25.796
So tell me,

08:25.838 --> 08:27.965
how is it we both forgot
the same person?

08:28.007 --> 08:30.843
And if you didn't tell
me that to begin with,

08:30.885 --> 08:33.846
I can only assume
it's because you haven't decided

08:33.888 --> 08:35.806
what you're going
to do with that spell.

08:35.847 --> 08:37.308
Have you?

08:39.393 --> 08:42.063
Who is that girl?

08:42.104 --> 08:45.858
Harae-tamai Kioku
Yomigaerashi-tamae!

09:15.805 --> 09:17.431
Oh, my eyes!

09:17.473 --> 09:18.975
What is this sorcery?!

09:19.016 --> 09:20.935
It's called "vervain," I think.

09:20.977 --> 09:22.645
It's cool, right?

09:27.233 --> 09:28.442
You did great!

09:28.484 --> 09:30.069
Told you this would work.

09:30.111 --> 09:32.196
Unhand me, you turnips.

09:32.238 --> 09:33.656
I had one drink.

09:33.698 --> 09:35.199
Yeah,
that drink's name was Wade.

09:35.241 --> 09:37.493
I think. I did not even

09:37.535 --> 09:39.245
kill your precious Wayne.

09:39.287 --> 09:41.497
Now unhand me before I...

09:43.165 --> 09:45.001
Damn. Why'd you do that?

09:45.042 --> 09:47.378
Maybe because I'm tired
of people giving me lip today.

09:47.420 --> 09:49.714
I don't care how geeked out
you are over Commonwealth Day.

09:49.755 --> 09:51.108
I'm putting you
on the next bus out of town.

09:51.132 --> 09:53.467
But I had this costume handmade.
Yeah, don't even

09:53.509 --> 09:57.513
get me started on all the things
wrong with you wearing that.

09:57.555 --> 09:59.999
I personally support
a woman's right

10:00.000 --> 10:00.224
I personally support
a woman's right

10:00.266 --> 10:01.726
to wear whatever she wants.

10:01.767 --> 10:04.020
Stop trying
to marsh my mellow, Kaleb.

10:04.061 --> 10:05.646
I'll leave
when I'm good and ready.

10:05.688 --> 10:08.024
Oh. I'll call Mom.
I'll call Dad.

10:08.065 --> 10:10.985
I... Damn it.

10:12.153 --> 10:13.338
Don't you got
something else to do

10:13.362 --> 10:14.631
other than sit here and chime in

10:14.655 --> 10:15.716
on matters that
don't concern you?

10:15.740 --> 10:17.908
Yeah. Yeah.

10:17.950 --> 10:20.328
I'm gonna grab Sebastian,
and I'm gonna take him to.

10:20.369 --> 10:22.055
Dr. Saltzman's office
at the high school until.

10:22.079 --> 10:23.748
Commonwealth Day's over.

10:23.789 --> 10:26.917
It's empty so no one should
be there when he wakes up.

10:26.959 --> 10:28.359
By "no one," you
mean Lizzie, right?

10:30.421 --> 10:31.255
You haven't told her.

10:31.297 --> 10:33.049
I was... I was gonna...

10:33.090 --> 10:34.884
Dude, come on.

10:34.925 --> 10:36.302
She's gonna be so pissed at me.

10:36.344 --> 10:38.304
Is that the blonde
from this morning?

10:39.889 --> 10:41.432
I sort of accidentally

10:41.474 --> 10:45.561
made her think she was having
a psychotic break.

10:47.146 --> 10:48.689
That's not gonna go well.

10:48.731 --> 10:50.483
I know.

10:50.524 --> 10:53.319
We have to keep this
a secret, Alice.

10:53.361 --> 10:56.155
Especially now
with my reelection campaign.

11:01.118 --> 11:02.870
I'll call you back.

11:02.912 --> 11:05.414
Festivities
aren't until tomorrow.

11:15.091 --> 11:17.635
Nice costume, buddy,
but back off.

11:36.862 --> 11:38.447
When I said
that I wanted to hang out,

11:38.489 --> 11:40.074
this is not what I had in mind.

11:40.116 --> 11:41.992
Who even found him?

11:42.034 --> 11:44.328
Or what's left of him?

11:44.370 --> 11:46.664
Alyssa Chang on her morning jog.

11:46.706 --> 11:48.624
Good thing, too.
Otherwise, this place would be

11:48.666 --> 11:49.291
crawling with police.

11:49.333 --> 11:52.586
What kind of monster
do you think we're dealing with?

11:52.628 --> 11:54.380
A Croatoan.

11:54.422 --> 11:56.716
How do you know that?

11:56.757 --> 11:58.342
Call it a hunch.

12:02.179 --> 12:04.223
Okay, squad.

12:04.265 --> 12:06.350
We have a problem,

12:06.392 --> 12:08.561
and we're down a witch
because Josie's in Richmond

12:08.602 --> 12:09.729
for Commonwealth Day.

12:09.770 --> 12:11.480
Which is bad for us, because...

12:11.522 --> 12:13.649
A Croatoan
came through the portal.

12:13.691 --> 12:15.860
And it killed a councilman.

12:15.901 --> 12:17.153
What the hell's a Croatoan?

12:17.194 --> 12:18.529
Hold up.

12:18.571 --> 12:20.448
The lost colony of Roanoke.

12:23.284 --> 12:25.745
- Seriously? Not one of you?
- I'll play.

12:25.786 --> 12:27.955
Roanoke. It's one of the
first English settlements

12:27.997 --> 12:30.207
in North America until it
just vanished without a trace.

12:30.249 --> 12:31.560
And the only thing left behind.

12:33.002 --> 12:34.128
"Croatoan."

12:35.004 --> 12:37.965
What? I'm a history nerd.

12:38.007 --> 12:40.718
- Why else would I be here for Commonwealth Day?
- Uh...

12:40.760 --> 12:42.928
I-Ignore her.
Her visitation privileges

12:42.970 --> 12:44.764
- are about to be revoked.
- The monster

12:44.805 --> 12:46.056
is here, and it's after Landon,

12:46.098 --> 12:47.600
so we need to get him
somewhere safe.

12:47.641 --> 12:48.893
Okay, um,

12:48.934 --> 12:50.436
no offense, but why is some girl

12:50.478 --> 12:51.937
from Mystic Falls
giving us orders?

12:51.979 --> 12:53.790
Oh, it's because she's a wolf.
Because she's a witch.

12:53.814 --> 12:56.150
Most importantly,
she knows how to kill monsters.

12:56.192 --> 12:57.693
- That's so cool.
- Wait, guys.

12:57.735 --> 12:59.487
What about the zombie?
I thought Malivore

12:59.528 --> 13:01.298
could only release one
monster at a time. Yeah.

13:01.322 --> 13:03.491
That's what we all thought.

13:03.532 --> 13:04.742
How the hell

13:04.784 --> 13:06.452
do you know about Malivore?

13:07.703 --> 13:09.330
Oh, I-I filled her in.

13:09.371 --> 13:10.372
Yeah. She... Mm-hmm.

13:10.414 --> 13:11.999
She took down the Oni,

13:12.041 --> 13:13.417
and she killed the Minotaur.

13:13.459 --> 13:15.461
Although that was actually
really more me.

13:15.503 --> 13:17.129
Wait, wait.
There was a Minotaur?

13:17.171 --> 13:19.215
Yeah. Not everything's
about you.

13:19.256 --> 13:21.133
All right. So, then,

13:21.175 --> 13:22.885
what's the plan,
Miss Were-witch?

13:22.927 --> 13:24.804
The plan is
that I will take Landon,

13:24.845 --> 13:26.430
put a barrier spell around him...
Oh.

13:26.472 --> 13:28.265
Wh-What she means

13:28.307 --> 13:31.977
is that I will babysit Landon
while everyone else is

13:32.019 --> 13:35.064
at Commonwealth Day
while Hope does her whole

13:35.105 --> 13:36.315
monster hunting deal.

13:37.274 --> 13:38.567
That is a great idea.

13:38.609 --> 13:40.820
And you know who should go
with her? Rafael.

13:42.988 --> 13:44.657
I can help with research.

13:44.698 --> 13:46.867
- Yeah, from the safety of your hotel room.
- Okay.

13:46.909 --> 13:49.203
Super squad disassemble or whatever.
Super squad.

13:50.788 --> 13:52.790
Cool. Okay, great.

13:52.832 --> 13:54.208
No? Not done here?

13:55.417 --> 13:56.836
It's a good plan. It keeps you

13:56.877 --> 13:58.546
as far away from Landon
as possible.

13:58.587 --> 14:00.965
I'm less worried
about me being with Landon

14:01.006 --> 14:03.467
than I am about you
blowing my secret to him.

14:03.509 --> 14:05.970
Relax.
I'll just ask him about...

14:06.011 --> 14:07.221
or something,

14:07.263 --> 14:08.448
and then he'll talk
the whole time.

14:08.472 --> 14:10.558
You have nothing

14:10.599 --> 14:11.642
to worry about.

14:11.684 --> 14:13.561
Okay.

14:17.940 --> 14:19.984
Mom.

14:20.025 --> 14:22.361
I'm sorry to bother you

14:22.403 --> 14:25.614
so... late.

14:25.656 --> 14:28.033
Or early.

14:28.075 --> 14:29.910
Whatever it is.

14:29.952 --> 14:32.705
Um...

14:32.746 --> 14:34.790
I'm in a situation.

14:37.251 --> 14:40.921
I found a way to bring back
everyone's Malivore memories.

14:40.963 --> 14:43.048
I just think it could really...

14:43.090 --> 14:46.343
hurt, um...

14:46.385 --> 14:48.846
people.

14:49.847 --> 14:52.433
I just don't know what to do.

14:56.395 --> 14:58.772
I got to admit, it's...

14:58.814 --> 14:59.999
it's nice to get
a break from town.

15:00.000 --> 15:02.192
It's nice to get
a break from town.

15:02.234 --> 15:04.904
You know, crowds still
get my heart racing.

15:05.863 --> 15:07.323
It can't be easy

15:07.364 --> 15:11.160
to adjust to being
around people.

15:11.201 --> 15:14.163
Talking with you helps.

15:14.204 --> 15:16.874
Me? You don't even know me.

15:16.916 --> 15:18.876
But I feel like I do.

15:18.918 --> 15:21.378
It's like I'm-I'm supposed to
or something.

15:21.420 --> 15:23.172
Look, look,

15:23.213 --> 15:25.466
I know you must already
have a couple...

15:25.507 --> 15:28.802
dozen guys or-or girls
that are interested in you.

15:30.220 --> 15:34.391
Technically, um,
I'm not seeing anyone.

15:34.433 --> 15:36.352
Then you should know that...

15:36.393 --> 15:39.063
I'm not afraid of
technicalities.

15:46.862 --> 15:48.322
What is that?

15:48.364 --> 15:49.865
A dark object

15:49.907 --> 15:51.742
from the school archives.

15:51.784 --> 15:53.619
Once I light it,

15:53.661 --> 15:55.579
nothing supernatural
can get inside.

15:55.621 --> 15:57.706
This should prevent you
from becoming Croa-toast.

16:00.167 --> 16:02.878
Um, I saw you and
Hope hanging out.

16:02.920 --> 16:05.339
Do you know if she's
seeing anyone?

16:05.381 --> 16:07.716
Shouldn't you be focusing
on Josie?

16:07.758 --> 16:09.802
Uh, yeah. I was
asking for Rafael.

16:09.843 --> 16:12.513
Good. Because now you've watered

16:12.554 --> 16:14.598
the garden
of Josie's eternal flower,

16:14.640 --> 16:17.017
I would think that you would
hold that to be sacred.

16:17.059 --> 16:18.244
Please tell me
that's a metaphor.

16:18.268 --> 16:20.104
My point is, once you've boned,

16:20.145 --> 16:21.581
you can never unbone.

16:21.605 --> 16:23.816
Not a metaphor.
And it would be a real crap guy move

16:23.857 --> 16:26.193
for you to shift your sights elsewhere.
For the record,

16:26.235 --> 16:27.820
I would never do that.

16:30.030 --> 16:31.740
Also...

16:31.782 --> 16:33.492
we didn't.

16:35.494 --> 16:38.205
I'm sorry, what?

16:38.247 --> 16:40.874
Not that it's any of your
business, but there was no...

16:42.251 --> 16:45.754
Watering? Boning? Whatever.

16:46.630 --> 16:48.716
Oh, my God.

16:48.757 --> 16:51.844
This changes everything.

16:51.885 --> 16:52.970
How?

16:55.431 --> 16:57.433
Never mind.

16:58.684 --> 17:02.396
Tell me, where do you stand...

17:02.438 --> 17:04.522
on Ewoks?

17:04.565 --> 17:05.875
I mean, they're basically
teddy bears,

17:05.898 --> 17:07.483
and who hates teddy bears?

17:07.526 --> 17:09.421
If you hate teddy bears, that's
on you. That's all I'm saying.

17:09.444 --> 17:13.115
Especially teddy bears
who took down the Empire.

17:14.074 --> 17:15.992
That's where I stand on Ewoks.

17:16.952 --> 17:18.494
That's fascinating.

17:18.537 --> 17:20.580
I'm gonna go take a nap.

17:22.624 --> 17:24.752
Oh.

17:39.224 --> 17:40.684
I thought the candle

17:40.726 --> 17:42.519
was supposed to keep
the monsters out.

17:42.561 --> 17:44.330
Me, too. It was supposed to keep
them from getting to you.

17:44.354 --> 17:46.356
Lizzie, it didn't go after me.

17:46.398 --> 17:48.025
It's after you.

17:57.284 --> 17:59.203
Immortality?

17:59.244 --> 18:01.288
Being a vampire is pretty sweet.

18:02.956 --> 18:04.750
There's downsides
to being a vamp, too.

18:04.792 --> 18:07.628
You can hurt people.

18:07.669 --> 18:09.797
Well, I don't think you would.

18:10.798 --> 18:13.133
Well, superspeed or not,

18:13.175 --> 18:16.220
I'm not finding anything
in Dr. Saltzman's books.

18:16.261 --> 18:18.514
'Cause you've got
the wrong book.

18:18.555 --> 18:20.808
I told you, history's my jam.

18:20.849 --> 18:22.327
And according to these
old wives' tales,

18:22.351 --> 18:23.936
this monster's, like,

18:23.977 --> 18:26.897
a Venus flytrap or something
mixed with an octopus.

18:26.939 --> 18:28.941
They stab their food in
the throat so their victims

18:28.982 --> 18:30.776
can't scream,
and then they dissolve them

18:30.818 --> 18:33.487
with acid-like saliva
until there's nothing left.

18:33.529 --> 18:35.531
And by food, you mean people.

18:35.572 --> 18:38.033
More like liars.

18:38.075 --> 18:41.036
Legend has it they hunt
fools keeping secrets.

18:41.078 --> 18:44.248
So let's be completely honest

18:44.289 --> 18:45.624
with each other.

18:47.584 --> 18:48.836
Uh...

18:48.877 --> 18:52.089
So-so, what else
does your book say?

18:52.131 --> 18:55.509
Croatoans can be summoned
by powerful witches.

18:55.551 --> 18:57.636
So there was a witch in Roanoke.

18:59.805 --> 19:01.557
Her name was Cassandra.

19:01.598 --> 19:04.143
I could tell you more about her,

19:04.184 --> 19:05.435
my dear turnip,

19:05.477 --> 19:07.688
if you abort this feeble attempt

19:07.729 --> 19:10.482
at romance and let me go.

19:10.524 --> 19:12.067
For the last time,

19:12.109 --> 19:13.527
I'm not a vegetable.

19:13.569 --> 19:16.655
And we're... just friends.

19:17.656 --> 19:19.199
Besides, why should we believe

19:19.241 --> 19:20.367
anything you say?

19:21.368 --> 19:24.246
Because I was there.

19:26.790 --> 19:28.167
I need help.

19:28.208 --> 19:29.769
Why does everyone assume

19:29.793 --> 19:31.044
I have superstrength?

19:31.086 --> 19:32.921
Trust me, no one thinks that.

19:38.010 --> 19:39.469
Fine, I'll get it.

19:41.054 --> 19:42.139
Hello?

19:42.181 --> 19:43.307
It's me, MG.

19:43.348 --> 19:45.142
I got some intel. Talk fast.

19:45.184 --> 19:46.244
Apparently, back in the day,

19:46.268 --> 19:48.061
this sketchy vamp
of the Old World

19:48.103 --> 19:50.105
was nibbling
on the settlers of Roanoke.

19:50.147 --> 19:51.398
There was this witch that he...

19:51.440 --> 19:54.359
was... courting.

19:54.401 --> 19:56.296
She wanted to get to the bottom
of who the secret killer

19:56.320 --> 19:57.446
was in the village.

19:57.487 --> 19:59.031
She said she was gonna manifest

19:59.072 --> 20:00.000
this demon creature that could

20:00.000 --> 20:00.699
this demon creature that could

20:00.741 --> 20:02.868
sniff out the killer
in their midst.

20:02.910 --> 20:05.120
A monster that fed on secrets.

20:05.162 --> 20:07.956
Secrets, you say.

20:09.166 --> 20:11.126
Well, that's great,

20:11.168 --> 20:13.921
because there's no one keeping
any of those around here.

20:15.088 --> 20:16.089
How do we kill it?

20:16.131 --> 20:17.341
That's a work in progress.

20:19.968 --> 20:21.595
Work faster.

20:21.637 --> 20:23.972
The damn thing waltzed through
my barrier like it was...

20:24.014 --> 20:25.599
immune.

20:25.641 --> 20:26.975
Because only the witch

20:27.017 --> 20:29.519
who summoned it can destroy it.

20:29.561 --> 20:32.064
That's a problem, 'cause she's
been dead for, like, 500 years.

20:34.900 --> 20:37.611
We're about to die.
Figure something out.

21:03.220 --> 21:05.430
Got your call.

21:05.472 --> 21:08.600
I take it it's not a date.

21:09.685 --> 21:11.270
We're still trying

21:11.311 --> 21:13.313
to piece together what happened.

21:13.355 --> 21:15.482
Thought you might be
able to shed some light.

21:15.524 --> 21:17.234
An animal attack.

21:17.276 --> 21:18.860
Animal attack.

21:18.902 --> 21:20.696
Mm-hmm. Yeah,
we get them here all the time.

21:20.737 --> 21:22.948
You can check
the police reports.

21:22.990 --> 21:24.741
Well, I have a friend at the FBI

21:24.783 --> 21:26.660
that I'm sending
the forensics to

21:26.702 --> 21:28.704
who may say otherwise.

21:28.745 --> 21:30.998
I-It would be better

21:31.039 --> 21:32.666
if you could just trust me
on this one.

21:32.708 --> 21:35.127
Oh. Well, that's
an interesting request,

21:35.168 --> 21:37.546
especially from someone
that a witness placed here

21:37.587 --> 21:39.798
around the time of the attack.

21:39.840 --> 21:42.301
This monster is hunting secrets,

21:42.342 --> 21:45.304
not you, so at least it has

21:45.345 --> 21:48.348
some taste, unlike my sister.
But that's the thing,

21:48.390 --> 21:49.701
no matter what Malivore
tells the monsters,

21:49.725 --> 21:51.286
they always follow their
prime directive first.

21:51.310 --> 21:52.495
So tell me whatever secret
you're keeping,

21:52.519 --> 21:53.520
and maybe it'll stop.

21:53.562 --> 21:55.897
Is it about Hope?

21:55.939 --> 21:56.440
It's about Hope, isn't it?

21:56.481 --> 21:58.442
I don't know
what you're talking about.

22:00.444 --> 22:01.611
Thing was useless anyway.

22:04.781 --> 22:07.200
Well, at least I had an idea.

22:09.161 --> 22:10.704
I just had one, too.

22:10.746 --> 22:13.123
Can you make us invisible
and break open his cell?

22:13.165 --> 22:14.708
I guess. Why?

22:14.750 --> 22:17.002
We're gonna do what every
great sci-fi franchise does...

22:17.044 --> 22:19.296
Kong versus Godzilla,
Alien versus Predator...

22:19.338 --> 22:20.922
We're gonna suck?

22:20.964 --> 22:22.758
That's blasphemy.
No, we're gonna...

22:22.799 --> 22:24.343
we're gonna let
the monsters fight.

22:24.384 --> 22:26.345
Oh, this is a nerdgasm,

22:26.386 --> 22:27.888
not a plan.

22:27.929 --> 22:29.848
Fine. Then just tell the truth.

22:33.352 --> 22:34.811
Invisique.

23:00.837 --> 23:02.190
I told you, nerd.

23:02.214 --> 23:03.799
Shh! LIZZIE: You shh!

23:03.840 --> 23:05.842
I have a better plan.

23:05.884 --> 23:08.428
Hey, ugly. Over here.

23:16.395 --> 23:18.688
Nice work, but that's not
gonna hold it long, so just...

23:18.730 --> 23:20.774
tell me the secret. I can't.

23:20.816 --> 23:23.193
Why?
It would break Josie's heart.

23:23.235 --> 23:25.155
So this is about Josie?
No, it's about all of us.

23:25.195 --> 23:25.779
Lizzie, since when

23:25.821 --> 23:27.581
have you kept your mouth shut
about anything?

23:27.614 --> 23:29.032
Just tell me.

23:29.074 --> 23:30.659
Fine! It's...

23:30.700 --> 23:32.285
Silencio.

23:36.706 --> 23:38.917
About you.

23:46.842 --> 23:48.236
We have to get out of here.
What are you

23:48.260 --> 23:49.278
- hiding from everyone?
- There's no time.

23:49.302 --> 23:50.637
These bars aren't gonna hold.

23:50.679 --> 23:52.139
We have to find some way
to stop it.

23:54.766 --> 23:57.352
MG is working on it.

23:57.394 --> 23:59.938
Also, because of Landon,
there is now

23:59.980 --> 24:01.648
a zombie on the loose.

24:01.690 --> 24:02.899
It was a good idea. Okay,

24:02.941 --> 24:04.067
one monster at a time.

24:04.109 --> 24:05.610
Raf, take Landon
to Dr. Saltzman.

24:05.652 --> 24:07.812
Lizzie and I will find a way
to keep the Croatoan busy.

24:08.738 --> 24:09.990
Let's go.

24:12.117 --> 24:13.397
Hey, come on, man.
You heard her.

24:15.537 --> 24:16.872
I don't understand why

24:16.913 --> 24:18.582
I can't remember more.

24:18.623 --> 24:21.001
Cassandra, she was...
my great love.

24:21.042 --> 24:22.752
Homegirl summoned a demon

24:22.794 --> 24:23.879
to snuff you out, though.

24:23.920 --> 24:25.338
Had she known it was me,

24:25.380 --> 24:27.108
I believe she would have
done things differently.

24:27.132 --> 24:28.800
Maybe you should have just been

24:28.842 --> 24:30.469
honest with the lady

24:30.510 --> 24:32.596
instead of skulking
around here like Dracula.

24:32.637 --> 24:34.639
A lesson in being honest

24:34.681 --> 24:37.517
about the woman one fancies
is particularly ironic

24:37.559 --> 24:40.395
coming from you, Milton.

24:42.439 --> 24:44.524
So you were just having a drink

24:44.566 --> 24:47.903
with Professor Vardemus,
the guy you punched in the face?

24:47.944 --> 24:49.547
I thought it was
in everyone's best interest

24:49.571 --> 24:51.031
that we make peace.

24:51.072 --> 24:54.075
I went home after, and...
that's all I know.

24:54.117 --> 24:56.828
You seem like a nice guy.
I want to believe you.

24:56.870 --> 24:59.581
But your name pops up in a
whole lot of police reports

24:59.623 --> 25:00.000
dealing with dead
bodies in this town.

25:00.001 --> 25:01.476
Dealing with dead
bodies in this town.

25:01.500 --> 25:03.376
Listen, I understand
your suspicions,

25:03.418 --> 25:07.839
but I had absolutely nothing to
do with those people in the bar.

25:07.881 --> 25:09.382
And your relationships?

25:09.424 --> 25:11.801
Seems like every woman
you're involved with

25:11.843 --> 25:13.428
meets a tragic end.

25:15.055 --> 25:17.557
One of the reasons
I don't open up so easily.

25:17.599 --> 25:19.935
And the same thing goes
for your husband, right?

25:19.976 --> 25:21.811
I understand
that he passed away under...

25:21.853 --> 25:23.480
questionable circumstances.

25:23.522 --> 25:25.440
Oh, you looked me up, too.

25:25.482 --> 25:26.900
It's almost flattering.

25:26.942 --> 25:28.151
Only fair.

25:29.361 --> 25:31.530
Look...

25:31.571 --> 25:32.948
I need something.

25:32.989 --> 25:35.158
Preferably an alibi, or...

25:35.200 --> 25:37.285
we should probably stop talking
until you lawyer up.

25:37.327 --> 25:39.120
Well, I'm sorry
you feel that way.

25:39.162 --> 25:41.122
But I already have one,

25:41.164 --> 25:42.666
and it's airtight.

25:42.707 --> 25:44.751
Then why are you only telling me
about it now?

25:44.793 --> 25:46.836
'Cause I was hoping
you'd trust me.

25:52.551 --> 25:54.135
Go ahead.

25:54.177 --> 25:55.929
Give him a call.

26:01.726 --> 26:03.353
You were gonna tell
Landon everything.

26:03.395 --> 26:05.146
We had a deal.
Well, things changed.

26:05.188 --> 26:07.315
Josie and Landon
didn't have sex, which means

26:07.357 --> 26:08.626
you might still want
to plant your flag

26:08.650 --> 26:11.236
on Muppet Treasure Island.
Wait. What?

26:11.278 --> 26:12.862
Shh. Be surprised quietly.

26:12.904 --> 26:15.073
There's still a monster
chasing us, remember?

26:16.658 --> 26:18.177
On second thought,
be as loud as you want.

26:18.201 --> 26:21.454
Because we are so screwed.

26:21.496 --> 26:23.206
Uh, it feeds on secrets, right?

26:23.248 --> 26:24.791
So let me have it, all of it.

26:25.875 --> 26:27.085
I prefer to die with dignity.

26:27.127 --> 26:28.670
Okay, fine, I'll start. Um...

26:28.712 --> 26:31.339
I stole your jade butterfly
clip in fifth grade.

26:31.381 --> 26:33.174
I loved that clip!

26:33.216 --> 26:34.551
Well, I had a crush

26:34.593 --> 26:36.845
on Josie for a week
when we were 14.

26:36.886 --> 26:39.723
The two of you

26:39.764 --> 26:42.350
happening.

26:43.101 --> 26:44.352
Uh, Lizzie? Focus.

26:44.394 --> 26:45.645
Okay, um,

26:45.687 --> 26:46.956
I accidentally killed
your hamster.

26:46.980 --> 26:48.857
I siphoned you to cheat
on finals.

26:48.898 --> 26:50.483
What?

26:50.525 --> 26:53.153
And I actually think
you're kind of cool.

26:56.781 --> 26:57.324
Okay, it's not working.

26:57.365 --> 26:59.743
It's not gonna stop
until everyone knows

26:59.784 --> 27:02.037
the secret we've been keeping
FROM THEM: That I'm back.

27:02.078 --> 27:03.163
I'm back, too.

27:04.914 --> 27:07.000
Harae-tamai Kioku.

27:07.042 --> 27:08.793
Yomigaerashi-tamae!

27:21.431 --> 27:22.432
Alaric?

27:22.474 --> 27:23.516
Ric!

27:40.784 --> 27:41.784
Jo!

28:04.683 --> 28:07.185
Here's the truth.

28:07.227 --> 28:09.187
Landon, I love you.

28:11.648 --> 28:13.191
Oh, my God.

28:14.359 --> 28:16.069
Oh, my God.

28:22.325 --> 28:23.702
Oh, my God!

28:23.743 --> 28:25.912
Are you okay?

28:25.954 --> 28:28.623
Your skinny ass dropped
like a bag of hammers.

28:30.208 --> 28:32.711
I felt like I was...

28:32.752 --> 28:34.337
hit by a spell.

28:34.379 --> 28:35.797
Like, the mother

28:35.839 --> 28:36.923
of all spells.

28:36.965 --> 28:39.008
And then there was...

28:41.594 --> 28:43.221
Hope.

28:43.263 --> 28:45.223
I remember now, too.

28:45.265 --> 28:46.641
Where there were but fragments,

28:46.683 --> 28:48.852
I now see the whole story.

28:48.893 --> 28:51.479
About Cassandra,

28:51.521 --> 28:53.148
the monster.

28:53.189 --> 28:55.525
How we killed it.

28:55.567 --> 28:57.610
She gave me this, this token.

28:59.279 --> 29:01.823
She said that it
would protect me.

29:01.865 --> 29:03.241
From... the monster?

29:03.283 --> 29:05.702
No. From the colony leadership.

29:05.744 --> 29:08.329
They asked Cassandra
to find the monster that was...

29:08.371 --> 29:09.956
that was terrorizing them.

29:11.416 --> 29:14.127
But she did love me.

29:14.169 --> 29:17.756
So she summoned
something even... worse.

29:17.797 --> 29:19.549
Something that

29:19.591 --> 29:23.428
would ferret out the lies
those Puritan hypocrites

29:23.470 --> 29:25.847
were concealing
from the rest of the village.

29:25.889 --> 29:29.100
Keep them from finding me.

29:29.142 --> 29:30.226
Then the Croatoan went ham.

29:30.268 --> 29:31.686
Wiped everyone out.

29:31.728 --> 29:33.480
Yeah. As you well know, Milton,

29:33.521 --> 29:35.815
everybody lies.

29:35.857 --> 29:38.109
When I found out what
Cassandra was plotting,

29:38.151 --> 29:39.944
I tried to stop her.

29:39.986 --> 29:42.363
She was keeping my secret.

29:42.405 --> 29:46.534
I feared that
she'd become a target.

29:46.576 --> 29:49.704
So she desiccated me...

29:49.746 --> 29:51.956
to keep me safe.

29:51.998 --> 29:54.709
In the state, I
watched the Croatoan

29:54.751 --> 29:58.171
tear her limb from limb
before she could dispel it.

30:00.590 --> 30:03.051
Unable to help her as she died.

30:05.720 --> 30:07.013
Damn.

30:08.473 --> 30:10.266
This was hers.

30:10.308 --> 30:13.353
Which is why you must use it
to slay the beast

30:13.394 --> 30:16.356
so that the same fate
does not befall upon Elizabeth.

30:40.296 --> 30:41.923
Can you talk?

30:41.965 --> 30:43.967
You know Malivore wants
me in one piece, right?

30:44.008 --> 30:45.528
So maybe we could find
a more comfortable way

30:45.552 --> 30:46.612
for me to get to the portal.

30:46.636 --> 30:47.679
Crescere arbor.

30:52.642 --> 30:55.436
Hope!

30:55.478 --> 30:57.981
Hope Mikaelson. Here, come here.

30:58.022 --> 30:58.773
Get behind me.
"Get behind..." Is that really

30:58.774 --> 31:01.568
all you have to say right now?
Can we not do this right now?

31:01.609 --> 31:03.695
We wouldn't even be having
this conversation

31:03.736 --> 31:04.821
if you could have your way.

31:05.905 --> 31:06.906
Ventus.

31:11.494 --> 31:13.931
Look, I didn't tell you because
I thought that you were happy.

31:13.955 --> 31:15.665
Happier. Without you?

31:15.707 --> 31:16.875
Happy enough to have sex.

31:16.916 --> 31:18.501
That was definitely gonna be
without me.

31:18.543 --> 31:20.378
Who told you that?
Does it matter?

31:20.420 --> 31:22.630
Good thing
you guys were arguing.

31:22.672 --> 31:24.257
I could hear you
from across town.

31:24.299 --> 31:26.318
This belonged to that witch
that created that thing,

31:26.342 --> 31:28.511
so maybe you...
Finis habentis maleficia.

31:35.310 --> 31:38.062
You know, something like that.

31:42.275 --> 31:44.068
Okay.

31:45.194 --> 31:47.196
Now we can talk.

32:04.422 --> 32:06.257
You sure you're okay?

32:06.299 --> 32:07.675
Yeah, I'm good.

32:07.717 --> 32:09.344
Just my...

32:09.385 --> 32:12.013
head is still spinning a little.

32:12.055 --> 32:14.891
Well, as I was saying before
you scared the hell out of me,

32:14.933 --> 32:17.685
Mayor Donovan vouched for
you, so you're free to go.

32:17.727 --> 32:19.562
Take my advice,

32:19.604 --> 32:21.064
it'd be to a hospital.

32:25.401 --> 32:27.445
I'm sorry.

32:30.406 --> 32:32.659
I probably pushed too hard.

32:32.700 --> 32:35.912
But it's like I know something
is off about this town.

32:35.954 --> 32:38.665
And maybe part of me
wanted to think it's you,

32:38.706 --> 32:40.708
because...

32:40.750 --> 32:43.086
then I wouldn't have to deal
with the fact that I'm...

32:43.127 --> 32:46.005
extremely attracted to you.

32:47.423 --> 32:49.634
If I'm being honest...

32:49.676 --> 32:51.469
I feel the same way.

32:53.846 --> 32:55.890
And that's why I've been
keeping things from you.

32:55.932 --> 32:57.475
What things?

32:59.185 --> 33:01.270
What happened at the bar,

33:01.312 --> 33:04.357
it wasn't the work of an animal.

33:04.399 --> 33:07.026
Then what was it?

33:07.068 --> 33:09.487
My best guess...

33:11.447 --> 33:14.117
is that it was a zombie.

33:14.158 --> 33:15.868
Or a vampire...
There are plenty of those

33:15.910 --> 33:18.955
running around here,
too, because

33:18.997 --> 33:22.375
supernatural beings have existed
in Mystic Falls for centuries.

33:22.417 --> 33:24.252
Do you expect me
to believe that?

33:24.293 --> 33:26.754
Quite the opposite.

33:26.796 --> 33:28.756
If I allowed myself
to care about you

33:28.798 --> 33:30.508
the way I want to,
I would tell you

33:30.550 --> 33:32.510
to leave this place behind.

33:32.552 --> 33:34.595
But the truth is,
I need a partner.

33:34.637 --> 33:37.682
A sheriff who will look the
other way when I need her to.

33:37.724 --> 33:41.936
Who will always believe
everything I say.

33:44.147 --> 33:46.899
That'll never be me, Ric.

33:48.359 --> 33:50.570
I know.

33:53.865 --> 33:55.033
This is Kaleb.

33:55.074 --> 33:57.201
He's a vampire.

33:58.453 --> 34:00.955
He's a teenager.

34:00.997 --> 34:03.207
You're right.

34:03.249 --> 34:06.210
I'm sorry for making this
more complicated than that.

34:06.252 --> 34:09.505
It won't happen again.

34:11.382 --> 34:13.801
Dr. S wants you to forget

34:13.842 --> 34:16.804
everything you know
about vampires, witches,

34:16.846 --> 34:19.806
werewolves... all
supernatural life.

34:19.849 --> 34:22.351
So you remember now?

34:22.393 --> 34:24.812
No thanks to you.

34:24.853 --> 34:27.065
I had to figure out
everything on my own.

34:27.106 --> 34:29.025
Well, you didn't tell me
about Hope, either.

34:29.067 --> 34:30.693
So we're even.

34:32.737 --> 34:34.489
How did you find out?

34:34.530 --> 34:36.449
I found Penelope's journal.

34:37.742 --> 34:39.094
I thought we were done
with that witch.

34:39.118 --> 34:40.578
Well, then you should

34:40.620 --> 34:43.164
probably stop using
that pen she gave you.

34:43.206 --> 34:45.100
It records everything
that you put in your diary.

34:45.123 --> 34:46.583
Including the fact

34:46.626 --> 34:48.145
that when I purged
the Oni from your mind,

34:48.168 --> 34:49.929
it brought back all
of your memories of Hope.

34:52.005 --> 34:54.300
You should have said something.

34:54.342 --> 34:56.302
I know.

34:56.344 --> 34:58.179
I wanted to protect you.

34:58.221 --> 34:59.388
I know.

34:59.430 --> 35:00.000
And a part of me didn't want.

35:00.000 --> 35:00.932
And a part of me didn't want

35:00.973 --> 35:03.935
to bring back
everyone's memories.

35:03.976 --> 35:06.562
But I talked to Mom.

35:06.604 --> 35:09.607
And she said that people
deserve to know the truth.

35:12.485 --> 35:14.445
Make their own choices.

35:14.487 --> 35:16.656
Even if they hurt.

35:20.701 --> 35:23.955
What choice do you think
Landon's gonna make?

35:25.414 --> 35:26.499
I don't know.

35:27.750 --> 35:29.168
But I will be here for you

35:29.210 --> 35:30.419
either way.

35:35.758 --> 35:37.927
On one condition.

35:37.969 --> 35:39.887
No more secrets.

35:43.015 --> 35:45.143
That sounds reasonable.

35:45.184 --> 35:47.645
Oh, God, I'm having an episode.

35:47.687 --> 35:48.705
At least this one's

35:48.729 --> 35:50.356
got a hot guy guest star.

35:50.398 --> 35:51.691
Wait.

35:51.732 --> 35:55.403
You can see him?

35:55.444 --> 35:58.739
Everyone can.

36:00.616 --> 36:02.910
There's something
I need to tell you.

36:19.385 --> 36:22.555
Doing the whole
lone wolf thing, huh?

36:23.806 --> 36:26.642
I get it, trust me.

36:26.684 --> 36:28.394
Then take a seat.

36:28.436 --> 36:31.272
I can't.

36:35.193 --> 36:38.154
Um, when I was, uh,
stuck as a wolf...

36:39.864 --> 36:41.908
you know,
Landon did everything he could

36:41.949 --> 36:43.993
to bring me back.

36:45.494 --> 36:47.997
I mean, he's always
looked out for me.

36:52.960 --> 36:55.338
I-I got to return the favor.

36:55.379 --> 36:57.757
How?

36:59.634 --> 37:02.053
By, um...

37:02.094 --> 37:05.765
owning up to the fact that I've
always had feelings for you.

37:05.806 --> 37:08.851
And now that I...

37:08.893 --> 37:10.686
I...

37:10.728 --> 37:12.772
I remember them.

37:14.815 --> 37:16.859
So...

37:19.695 --> 37:22.823
we can't be around
each other anymore.

37:30.206 --> 37:32.250
I'm sorry.

37:49.892 --> 37:51.936
Looks like you're
deep in thought.

37:51.978 --> 37:55.398
More like steeling myself
for what I have to tell you.

38:02.321 --> 38:06.617
So I take it you weren't
on a field trip to Richmond?

38:08.869 --> 38:11.747
Um, I was in New Orleans.

38:11.789 --> 38:14.667
I needed to find a witch.

38:14.709 --> 38:16.836
There's plenty of those
around here.

38:16.877 --> 38:18.296
Um...

38:18.337 --> 38:21.173
Mikaelson witch.

38:21.215 --> 38:23.342
Hope's aunt.

38:23.384 --> 38:26.679
I needed answers.

38:26.721 --> 38:29.849
I needed a push
to do the right thing.

38:29.890 --> 38:32.518
Bring back everyone's memories.

38:34.520 --> 38:39.025
Hope's family was missing
a piece of their life, too.

38:41.944 --> 38:43.321
I needed to see that for myself,

38:43.362 --> 38:45.614
so I would stop
being so selfish.

38:47.074 --> 38:48.552
You are literally
the least selfish person

38:48.576 --> 38:50.619
I've ever met.

38:52.830 --> 38:54.874
That's nothing
I had to remember.

38:57.793 --> 39:00.546
'Cause it's something
I'll never forget.

39:06.677 --> 39:08.929
But you do remember her.

39:11.015 --> 39:13.267
That changes things, right?

39:13.309 --> 39:16.437
I don't know yet.

39:20.024 --> 39:22.193
I just need some time.

39:25.863 --> 39:29.617
I just...

39:29.658 --> 39:31.702
need time.

39:37.541 --> 39:40.586
Yeah, of course.

39:57.144 --> 39:59.438
Hope?

40:02.566 --> 40:04.402
Aunt Freya?

40:05.305 --> 40:11.876
