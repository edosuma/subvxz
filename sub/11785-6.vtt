40:52.409 --> 40:53.368
"WHAT ARE YOU THINKING?

40:53.410 --> 40:54.827
HOW ARE YOU FEELING?"

40:54.869 --> 40:57.914
EVERYTHING SHE KNOWS,

40:54.869 --> 40:57.914
SHE LEARNED OFF OF YOU.

40:57.956 --> 41:00.458
I DIDN'T MAKE HER

40:57.956 --> 41:00.458
TO REPLACE YOU.

41:00.499 --> 41:02.794
I'D NEVER WANT TO REPLACE YOU.

41:02.835 --> 41:06.589
SHE'S -- SHE'S  FOR  YOU.

41:11.510 --> 41:13.846
[ CHUCKLES ] I LOVE IT.

41:13.888 --> 41:14.889
REALLY?

41:14.931 --> 41:16.682
YEAH.

41:14.931 --> 41:16.682
I'M GONNA CALL HER "HARDY."

41:16.724 --> 41:19.811
OKAY. NO.

41:16.724 --> 41:19.811
UM, IT'S "PARKER 2000."

41:19.852 --> 41:22.021
-IT SAYS SO RIGHT THERE

41:19.852 --> 41:22.021
IN THE FINE PRINT.

41:19.852 --> 41:22.021
-IT USED TO BE.

41:22.063 --> 41:25.150
OKAY, NO. THAT'S --

41:22.063 --> 41:25.150
THAT'S NOT GONNA WORK.

41:25.191 --> 41:26.859
-THAT'S --

41:25.191 --> 41:26.859
-HARDY IT IS.

41:26.901 --> 41:29.070
BUT IT'S PARKER 2000.

41:26.901 --> 41:29.070
IT'S LIKE --

41:29.112 --> 41:31.072
YEAH, BUT YOU SAID IT'S MINE,

41:29.112 --> 41:31.072
SO I CAN NAME IT

41:29.112 --> 41:31.072
WHATEVER I WANT.

41:31.114 --> 41:33.074
SHE SHALL BE CALLED HARDY.

41:31.114 --> 41:33.074
YOU LIKE THAT NAME, DON'T YOU?

41:33.116 --> 41:34.909
[ High-pitched voice ] YES.

41:33.116 --> 41:34.909
[ Normal voice ] YES.

41:34.951 --> 41:37.829
RIGHT, BUT WHEN I INVENTED IT,

41:34.951 --> 41:37.829
I REGISTERED THE NAME

41:34.951 --> 41:37.829
AS PARKER 2000.

41:37.870 --> 41:40.373
-SHE LIKES IT. SHE LIKES IT.

41:37.870 --> 41:40.373
-HARDY IS GOOD. I CAN  MAKE

41:37.870 --> 41:40.373
A HARDY.
