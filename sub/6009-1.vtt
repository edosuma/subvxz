00:35.510 --> 00:37.965
Here we are! You'll be all right!

00:45.339 --> 00:48.138
Sergeant Stephens. Yes, sir.
I want every wounded man

00:48.139 --> 00:50.417
taken down the line
before it starts to get dark.

00:50.418 --> 00:52.699
We've bloody well lost enough of them
for one day.

00:58.219 --> 01:00.459
When did this arrive?
This morning, sir.

01:01.539 --> 01:03.578
Ah, good news.

01:03.579 --> 01:05.698
We're to be relieved today
by the Devons.

01:05.699 --> 01:07.418
The men can finally get some rest

01:07.419 --> 01:09.458
and I've got a few days' leave
coming to me.

01:09.459 --> 01:11.938
What will you do with them, sir?
London first.

01:11.939 --> 01:14.418
To remind myself what real food
tastes like.

01:14.419 --> 01:16.899
Then north for a couple of days,
I suppose.

01:17.779 --> 01:20.498
Naturally, there's a girl I want to
see while I'm there.

01:20.499 --> 01:22.538
So I should hope, sir.

01:22.539 --> 01:24.258
It's strange, isn't it?

01:24.259 --> 01:26.737
To think about our old lives just
going on as before.

01:26.738 --> 01:29.179
While we're here, in this.
It's more than strange.

01:29.180 --> 01:31.218
When I think of my life at Downton,

01:31.219 --> 01:33.219
it seems like another world.

02:10.059 --> 02:12.938
We normally have everything done
before the family wakes up,

02:12.939 --> 02:14.779
but it's all at sixes and sevens
today.

02:14.780 --> 02:17.778
I'll go through it with you
tomorrow, when we're back to normal.

02:17.779 --> 02:19.779
I do know how to run a house.

02:22.699 --> 02:24.699
Come along.

02:27.019 --> 02:29.899
It goes under the epaulette.
I'm sorry, M'Lord.

02:30.419 --> 02:32.538
If I'd known, I'd have asked
Mr Bates about it

02:32.539 --> 02:34.258
before he left for London.

02:34.259 --> 02:37.259
Because I'll be in uniform
a lot of the time, in future.

02:37.579 --> 02:40.458
Does being lord lieutenant mean
you're back in the army?

02:40.459 --> 02:43.178
Not exactly. The lord liet' is
responsible for the army

02:43.179 --> 02:44.978
in the county while the war's on.

02:44.979 --> 02:48.098
But, no, I'm not back in the army.

02:48.099 --> 02:50.099
It appears they don't want me.

02:58.899 --> 03:00.899
(BARKING)

03:03.099 --> 03:06.738
Morning. I don't suppose there's
any news of Bates?

03:06.739 --> 03:08.659
We expect him back any day, My Lord.

03:08.660 --> 03:11.298
He wrote to Anna that they had the
funeral last Monday.

03:11.299 --> 03:15.058
William's a good chap, but he's not
Bates when it comes to uniforms.

03:15.059 --> 03:17.058
I may not be a real soldier,

03:17.059 --> 03:19.819
but I think I ought to look like one.
Quite, My Lord.

03:20.419 --> 03:22.539
We don't often see you in here
for breakfast.

03:23.579 --> 03:25.539
Isobel said she was coming up
to help

03:25.540 --> 03:27.618
and your mother threatened
to look in.

03:27.619 --> 03:30.819
No doubt they would love it
if they found me still in bed.

03:33.099 --> 03:34.818
I don't believe it.

03:34.819 --> 03:37.418
Please say it's something nice.

03:37.419 --> 03:39.138
General Robertson's invited me

03:39.139 --> 03:42.218
to be Colonel of the North Riding
Volunteers. This is the best bit.

03:42.219 --> 03:43.978
(READS)
'It may please you to know

03:43.979 --> 03:46.258
that the idea was given to me
by General Haig.'

03:46.259 --> 03:49.338
Well if Haig's involved, it means
I'm back in the army properly.

03:49.339 --> 03:52.698
How can that be? You were told you
weren't wanted for active service.

03:52.699 --> 03:55.538
You can't jump in and out of the
army like a jack-in-the-box.

03:55.539 --> 03:58.218
I don't see why not.
Churchill went back to the front

03:58.219 --> 04:01.538
after the Gallipoli business.
If he can do it, why shouldn't I?

04:01.539 --> 04:03.578
Sybil, are you all right?

04:03.579 --> 04:05.618
Sybil, darling?

04:05.619 --> 04:07.859
Would you excuse me.
I think I'll just...

04:09.739 --> 04:11.739
She's had more bad news.

04:16.059 --> 04:19.938
I do think I'm getting better,
don't you? Up to a point, M'Lady.

04:19.939 --> 04:22.098
(GEARS CRUNCH)
If you could just get the clutch

04:22.099 --> 04:24.579
right down to the floor. But I am.
Not quite, M'Lady.

04:24.580 --> 04:26.618
It doesn't seem to want to go.

04:26.619 --> 04:28.778
I think it wants to,
if you ask it properly.

04:28.779 --> 04:30.858
(GEARS CRUNCH AND RELEASE)
That's better.

04:30.859 --> 04:32.618
You'll be putting me out of a job.

04:32.619 --> 04:34.739
Won't the call up put you all
out of your jobs?

04:35.859 --> 04:38.098
I'll cross that bridge
when I come to it.

04:38.099 --> 04:40.258
(HORN BEEPS)

04:40.259 --> 04:42.618
What are you giving them to eat?
Not much.

04:42.619 --> 04:44.698
They know the money's
for the hospital,

04:44.699 --> 04:46.898
so they can't expect
Belshazzar's Feast.

04:46.899 --> 04:50.218
I'll make some cheese straws.
What's the matter with you?

04:50.219 --> 04:52.819
Nothing much.
My dad still won't let me enlist.

04:54.259 --> 04:56.258
Your father has no-one but you.

04:56.259 --> 04:59.498
Of course he doesn't want you to
enlist. Who can argue with him?

04:59.499 --> 05:03.378
So I stand by while the lads on the
farms and in the gardens go to war.

05:03.379 --> 05:05.699
Even Thomas is at the front in the
Medical Corps.

05:05.700 --> 05:07.738
Ha, that'll come as a nasty shock.

05:07.739 --> 05:09.978
Oh, you can make fun of him,
Mrs Patmore,

05:09.979 --> 05:12.459
but he's fight for his king and
country and I'm not.

05:12.460 --> 05:14.658
Well, I daresay you won't have long
to wait.

05:14.659 --> 05:17.338
Well, I hope you're right.
Do you?

05:17.339 --> 05:21.299
Because I don't.
I hope very much that I am wrong.

05:22.939 --> 05:26.578
It's kind of you to let us have it
here. They'll enjoy it so much more.

05:26.579 --> 05:29.138
And you can charge so much more
for the tickets.

05:29.139 --> 05:32.338
Good morning, Mama. This is very
early for you to be up and about.

05:32.339 --> 05:34.938
War makes early risers of us all.

05:34.939 --> 05:37.059
I thought I would help with
the flowers.

05:38.899 --> 05:40.818
Bassett has plenty...

05:40.819 --> 05:42.739
but thank you.

05:46.099 --> 05:48.898
You don't mind my taking over
the flowers, do you?

05:48.899 --> 05:52.978
Cora's flowers always look more
suited to a first communion...

05:52.979 --> 05:55.299
in southern Italy.

05:57.059 --> 06:00.138
Well, what else have you planned
for tonight's revels?

06:00.139 --> 06:02.778
Anything we can think of that will
raise money.

06:02.779 --> 06:06.579
Hot, buttered toast with a countess
at tuppence a slice?

06:08.259 --> 06:10.819
You drop the cushions on the floor
to plump them up.

06:11.539 --> 06:13.458
I know.

06:13.459 --> 06:15.219
Ethel, are you settling in?

06:15.939 --> 06:19.539
I would be... if Anna'd stop
teaching me how to suck eggs.

06:20.059 --> 06:22.338
I was head housemaid
in my last position.

06:22.339 --> 06:26.858
You were senior housemaid,
out of two, in a much smaller house.

06:26.859 --> 06:28.938
Are they to come in here tonight?

06:28.939 --> 06:31.738
Only at the interval. And keep them
out of the drawing room.

06:31.739 --> 06:33.898
I thought Mr Bates would've been
back by now,

06:33.899 --> 06:35.579
or he could've stood guard.

06:37.459 --> 06:40.378
Who is this Mr Bates?
His Lordship's valet.

06:40.379 --> 06:42.858
He's been in London
because his mother died.

06:42.859 --> 06:45.738
Only everyone talks about him
as if her were king.

06:45.739 --> 06:47.859
Do they? That's nice to hear.

06:48.219 --> 06:50.258
Anna...

06:50.259 --> 06:54.179
help me do battle with
this monstrosity.

06:55.339 --> 06:58.179
Looks like a creature from
The Lost World.

06:59.899 --> 07:01.899
Oh...

07:07.259 --> 07:09.418
You should let William do that.

07:09.419 --> 07:11.458
He's got enough on his hands,

07:11.459 --> 07:13.698
getting the uniforms out of
mothballs.

07:13.699 --> 07:17.098
(STRAINED)
I must remember to put
Anna on alert for dinner tonight.

07:17.099 --> 07:21.538
You have to ease up a bit or you'll
give yourself a heart attack.

07:21.539 --> 07:24.738
There's a war on. Things cannot
be the same when there's a war on.

07:24.739 --> 07:28.658
I do not agree. Keeping up standards
is the only way to show the Germans

07:28.659 --> 07:30.778
that they will not beat us
in the end.

07:30.779 --> 07:32.898
Well, give me some warning
the next time

07:32.899 --> 07:36.179
we're expecting Germans at Downton
and I'll see what I can do.

07:40.299 --> 07:42.338
Thank you.

07:42.339 --> 07:44.979
Oh, we thought we'd come in here
for a little talk.

07:46.419 --> 07:48.779
Oh, well I'm sure we won't be
disturbed.

07:50.059 --> 07:51.739
Please.

07:54.259 --> 07:56.938
Well, the thing is...

07:56.939 --> 07:58.778
I've had a letter from Matthew.

07:58.779 --> 08:01.938
Of course, he doesn't tell me
what he's actually doing.

08:01.939 --> 08:03.738
No, he wouldn't.

08:03.739 --> 08:05.738
But I'm glad he's all right.
I miss him.

08:05.739 --> 08:07.458
Well, that's the point.

08:07.459 --> 08:10.538
You must know he's been down here
a few times since the war started.

08:10.539 --> 08:12.578
We had heard.

08:12.579 --> 08:14.738
Downton is hardly a metropolis.

08:14.739 --> 08:17.938
Is he still determined to go back
to Manchester when it's all over?

08:17.939 --> 08:21.218
He doesn't talk much about life
after the war, none of them do.

08:21.219 --> 08:23.458
I suppose they don't want to
tempt fate.

08:23.459 --> 08:25.459
Until now, that is.

08:26.459 --> 08:30.779
He writes that he is engaged to be
married to a Miss Lavinia Swire.

08:36.259 --> 08:39.857
Well... I suppose we all knew
it would happen one day.

08:39.859 --> 08:41.859
Do you know her?
Not yet.

08:43.179 --> 08:46.138
Apparently they met when he was in
England last time.

08:46.139 --> 08:48.338
It all seems rather hurried.

08:48.339 --> 08:51.138
You can't blame them for wanting to
live in the present.

08:51.139 --> 08:53.059
Anyway, he's been in London on leave

08:53.060 --> 08:55.218
and now he's bringing her here to
meet me.

08:55.219 --> 08:57.099
He'll be here tonight and tomorrow,

08:57.100 --> 09:00.018
and then he leaves on Thursday,
while she stays for a bit.

09:00.019 --> 09:03.298
So will you miss the concert?
Well, that's up to you.

09:03.299 --> 09:06.818
We'd all hoped that he and Mary
would sort things out between them.

09:06.819 --> 09:10.538
But if that's not to be, shouldn't
we try to get back to normal?

09:10.539 --> 09:13.258
Even if he's not keen to live
in the village...

09:13.259 --> 09:15.059
he's still the heir.

09:16.499 --> 09:18.538
And you're still his family.

09:18.539 --> 09:20.298
I quite agree.

09:20.299 --> 09:22.458
We can't know if Matthew will come
through it.

09:22.459 --> 09:25.778
Either way, I would like to see him
and I want to wish him luck.

09:25.779 --> 09:28.338
The trouble is, Mary's back from
London today as well.

09:28.339 --> 09:30.378
She gets in at five o'clock.

09:30.379 --> 09:34.338
Matthew's driving down in Lavinia's
car, they won't meet on the train.

09:34.339 --> 09:36.579
Oh, that's a relief.

09:37.779 --> 09:40.218
I hate Greek drama.

09:40.219 --> 09:42.658
You know, when everything happens
off stage.

09:42.659 --> 09:46.098
But should we tell her not to come?
We might still catch her.

09:46.099 --> 09:48.138
Isobel's right.

09:48.139 --> 09:50.618
We must use this engagement
as a new beginning.

09:50.619 --> 09:53.338
You bring our Lieutenant Crawley
to the concert

09:53.339 --> 09:55.058
and stay for dinner afterwards.

09:55.059 --> 09:57.059
I was hoping you'd say that.

10:03.779 --> 10:07.298
Oh, there you are. I'm just going
home, but I'll be back at four.

10:07.299 --> 10:09.299
Sybil, my dear, what's the matter?

10:15.059 --> 10:17.459
Tom Bellasis has been killed.

10:18.699 --> 10:20.618
What a terrible thing.

10:20.619 --> 10:22.619
I remember him at Imogen's ball.

10:23.699 --> 10:27.099
He made me laugh out loud just as
her uncle was giving a speech.

10:29.219 --> 10:31.898
Sometimes...

10:31.899 --> 10:34.659
it feels as if all the men
I ever danced with are dead.

10:37.179 --> 10:39.218
I just feel so useless,

10:39.219 --> 10:42.298
wasting my life while they sacrifice
theirs.

10:42.299 --> 10:45.338
You've been a tremendous help with
the concert. No, I...

10:45.339 --> 10:49.098
I don't mean selling programmes or
finding prizes for the tombola.

10:49.099 --> 10:52.539
I want to do a real job, real work.

10:53.219 --> 10:55.219
Well...

10:56.699 --> 10:59.778
if you're serious, what about
being an auxiliary nurse?

10:59.779 --> 11:01.697
There's a training college in York.

11:01.698 --> 11:03.659
I know I could get you on to
a course.

11:03.660 --> 11:07.738
It may be something of a rough
awakening. Are you ready for that?

11:07.739 --> 11:10.498
I mean, have you ever made
your own bed, for example?

11:10.499 --> 11:12.458
Or scrubbed a floor?

11:12.459 --> 11:14.459
O'Brien, what is it?

11:14.859 --> 11:18.418
Mr Platt is taking Her Ladyship and
Lady Grantham down to the village.

11:18.419 --> 11:20.618
She wondered if you'd like to go
with them.

11:20.619 --> 11:22.859
That's very kind. Thank you.

11:24.859 --> 11:26.898
Go on, what else would I need?

11:26.899 --> 11:29.419
Well, if you're serious,
what about cooking?

11:29.939 --> 11:32.178
Why don't you ask Mrs Patmore

11:32.179 --> 11:35.338
if she could give you one or two
basic tips?

11:35.339 --> 11:37.177
When you get to York,
it might be useful

11:37.178 --> 11:38.899
to know a little more than nothing.

11:40.779 --> 11:44.259
They want to use her as a maid of
all work at the hospital.

11:44.979 --> 11:48.258
I suppose it's cheaper when Lady
Sybil can live here for nothing.

11:48.259 --> 11:51.338
But it doesn't see quite right,
somehow, to take advantage.

11:51.339 --> 11:53.339
No, it does not.

11:53.419 --> 11:57.018
I hear the young men that are being
brought in now are very disfigured.

11:57.019 --> 11:59.058
How terrible.

11:59.059 --> 12:01.099
Limbs missing and faces blown apart.

12:02.099 --> 12:05.139
And Lady Sybil's been nurtured
so very gently.

12:06.659 --> 12:08.899
And what types would she be working
with?

12:10.419 --> 12:12.459
Still, you'll know what's best
to do.

12:13.939 --> 12:15.978
Yes.

12:15.979 --> 12:18.219
I certainly will.

12:24.379 --> 12:27.738
Where's the butter for the pancakes?
It's in the cold larder.

12:27.739 --> 12:30.179
Are we having pancakes tonight?
Are we heck as like.

12:30.180 --> 12:32.498
Upstairs dinner, crepes Suzette.

12:32.499 --> 12:35.298
Oh, I've always wanted to try those.
Could you save me some?

12:35.299 --> 12:37.338
If they don't finish them all.

12:37.339 --> 12:40.178
Save you some crepes Suzette?

12:40.179 --> 12:42.499
If you don't mind.
What are we having?

12:43.019 --> 12:46.338
Lamb stew and semolina.
Do you eat a lot of stews?

12:46.339 --> 12:49.858
Don't you fancy that, dear?
Not all the time.

12:49.859 --> 12:51.898
Oh, I see.

12:51.899 --> 12:54.498
Would you like to sleep
in Her Ladyship's bedroom

12:54.499 --> 12:56.459
while you're at it?
I wouldn't mind.

12:56.460 --> 12:59.618
I hate sharing a room.
I didn't in my last place.

12:59.619 --> 13:02.978
There were only two maids
and a cook. I'm just saying.

13:02.979 --> 13:06.979
And I'll 'just say' if you don't
look out!

13:09.899 --> 13:12.018
You've got a cheek,
on your first day.

13:12.019 --> 13:14.058
I don't see why.

13:14.059 --> 13:16.418
I want the best and I'm not ashamed
to admit it.

13:16.419 --> 13:18.258
And you think we don't?

13:18.259 --> 13:20.179
I think it's hard to change
at your age.

13:21.699 --> 13:24.138
I don't blame you, but I suppose,

13:24.139 --> 13:26.499
in the end, I want to be more than
just a servant.

13:31.939 --> 13:33.658
I'm sorry,

13:33.659 --> 13:35.738
but if Dr Clarkson needs free labour,

13:35.739 --> 13:38.178
I'd prefer him not to find it in
my nursery.

13:38.179 --> 13:41.218
But Sybil isn't in the nursery.
And in case you hadn't noticed,

13:41.219 --> 13:44.018
she hasn't been there for some time.
You know what I mean.

13:44.019 --> 13:46.058
Well, no, not really.

13:46.059 --> 13:48.738
You can't pretend it's not
respectable.

13:48.739 --> 13:52.858
When every day we're treated to
pictures of queens and princesses

13:52.859 --> 13:57.538
in Red Cross uniform, ladling soup
down the throat of some unfortunate.

13:57.539 --> 13:59.338
But Sybil won't be ladling soup.

13:59.339 --> 14:01.698
She'll have to witness unimaginable
horrors.

14:01.699 --> 14:04.698
When she's an innocent.
Her innocence will protect her.

14:04.699 --> 14:07.019
For once, I agree with
Cousin Isobel.

14:08.339 --> 14:11.499
Sybil must be allowed to do her bit,
like everyone else.

14:13.979 --> 14:17.819
What about you, Molesley? Are you
ready for the call, if it comes?

14:17.939 --> 14:19.738
It won't be coming for me, M'Lady.

14:19.739 --> 14:23.658
I had a letter from the War Office
to say I'm not suitable for service.

14:23.659 --> 14:25.698
Why not?

14:25.699 --> 14:27.738
I really couldn't say, M'Lady.

14:27.739 --> 14:30.938
As you can imagine, Molesley's
father is beside himself with joy.

14:30.939 --> 14:34.299
God moves in a mysterious way.
His wonders to perform.

14:59.179 --> 15:02.258
Bates, no-one told me
you were on this train.

15:02.259 --> 15:04.298
They didn't know, M'Lady.

15:04.299 --> 15:06.259
We'll give you a lift to the house.

15:33.499 --> 15:37.219
Why didn't you say you were coming?
I didn't know till today.

15:44.859 --> 15:47.018
Anna, I borrowed a case from
Lady Rosamund.

15:47.019 --> 15:50.138
I bought some things while I was
in London. Very good, M'Lady.

15:50.139 --> 15:52.178
Well, it would be our secret.

15:52.179 --> 15:54.858
A surprise. You don't mind, do you?

15:54.859 --> 15:56.898
Oh, it's not that I mind, M'Lady...

15:56.899 --> 15:58.938
And I only need the basics.

15:58.939 --> 16:00.978
How to boil an egg, how to make tea.

16:00.979 --> 16:02.979
Don't you know how to make tea?

16:03.059 --> 16:04.779
Not really.

16:05.659 --> 16:07.658
You're right, it is a joke.

16:07.659 --> 16:10.498
But when I start my course,
I don't want to be a joke.

16:10.499 --> 16:12.979
Will you help me?
Course we will, won't we?

16:13.779 --> 16:15.818
If you say so.

16:15.819 --> 16:17.858
Let's get started.

16:17.859 --> 16:20.058
Do you know how to fill a kettle?

16:20.059 --> 16:22.219
Everyone knows that.

16:26.539 --> 16:28.539
Not everyone, apparently.

16:39.019 --> 16:40.858
Oh...

16:40.859 --> 16:42.738
When can I talk to you?

16:42.739 --> 16:45.378
After the concert.
Outside, in the courtyard.

16:45.379 --> 16:48.179
There's bound to be a gap
before they start dinner.

16:50.059 --> 16:52.898
Are you going up for the concert?
Maybe. Can I sit with you?

16:52.899 --> 16:54.859
Don't be daft, we've got a dinner
to make.

16:54.860 --> 16:57.778
I've not got time for concerts.
I've had a letter from my dad.

16:57.779 --> 17:00.257
He won't change his mind.
He says he can live with it

17:00.258 --> 17:02.579
if I get called up, as there's
nothing we can do.

17:02.580 --> 17:05.657
But if I enlist and anything
happens, he'll never get over it.

17:05.659 --> 17:09.298
He loves you. He may love me,
but he doesn't own me.

17:09.299 --> 17:11.299
And he's not being fair.

17:13.098 --> 17:16.377
Glad to be back?
I'm never sure.

17:16.378 --> 17:19.498
When I'm in London, I long
for Yorkshire and when I'm here,

17:19.499 --> 17:22.178
I ache to hear my heels clicking on
the pavement.

17:22.179 --> 17:24.738
I'd forgotten about this nightmare
concert.

17:24.739 --> 17:27.179
Why didn't you warn me?
I'd have come back tomorrow.

17:27.699 --> 17:29.699
But you'd have missed Matthew.

17:31.379 --> 17:33.418
I was going to tell you.

17:33.419 --> 17:36.738
Matthew's on leave and he's in the
village,

17:36.739 --> 17:40.138
so Papa and I thought it would be
a good time to mend our fences.

17:40.139 --> 17:42.178
He's coming tonight with Isobel.

17:42.179 --> 17:44.139
And his fiancee.

17:45.339 --> 17:47.378
What?
Edith...

17:47.379 --> 17:49.739
I don't know how helpful
you're being.

17:50.939 --> 17:52.978
Matthew's engaged.

17:52.979 --> 17:55.379
He's brought her to Downton to meet
his mother.

17:57.139 --> 17:59.139
Well, how marvellous.

18:00.539 --> 18:02.979
You don't mind?
Why should I?

18:03.539 --> 18:05.338
We're not going to marry,

18:05.339 --> 18:08.058
but I don't want him to spend the
rest of his life in a cave.

18:08.059 --> 18:09.859
Exactly what Papa and I feel.

18:10.739 --> 18:12.778
Please try to be happy for him.

18:12.779 --> 18:15.539
Of course I'm happy.
Good luck to him.

18:16.659 --> 18:19.018
Anyway, there's someone I want you
all to meet.

18:19.019 --> 18:21.459
Have you ever come across
Richard Carlisle?

18:21.779 --> 18:23.818
Sir Richard Carlisle?

18:23.819 --> 18:26.338
The one with all those horrid
newspapers?

18:26.339 --> 18:29.378
We met at Cliveden.
But how old is he?

18:29.379 --> 18:31.898
Old enough not to ask
stupid questions.

18:31.899 --> 18:34.098
Anyway, I can't wait for you to know
him.

18:34.099 --> 18:36.459
If only Papa hadn't closed down
the shoot.

18:37.539 --> 18:40.659
Most people have stopped shooting
now that the war's on.

18:41.259 --> 18:45.058
But I'm sure Papa would be happy to
have Sir Richard come and stay.

18:45.059 --> 18:48.418
Are you? I shouldn't have thought
he was Papa's type at all.

18:48.419 --> 18:50.939
Are you coming?
I'll be down in a minute.

19:04.979 --> 19:06.979
Are you all right, M'Lady?

19:09.459 --> 19:11.459
Oh, Anna...

19:42.739 --> 19:44.778
It's awfully grand.

19:44.779 --> 19:46.618
You'd better get used to it.

19:46.619 --> 19:48.538
It'll be your home one day.

19:48.539 --> 19:51.698
I'm not sure 'home' would ever be
quite the word to describe it.

19:51.699 --> 19:55.498
My dear fellow, welcome back.
It's so very good to see you.

19:55.499 --> 19:57.578
May I present Miss Lavinia Swire?

19:57.579 --> 20:00.378
How do you do, Lord Grantham.
How do you do, Miss Swire.

20:00.379 --> 20:03.898
So... that's Mary's replacement.

20:03.899 --> 20:07.178
Well, I suppose looks aren't
everything.

20:07.179 --> 20:09.179
I think she seems rather sweet.

20:10.139 --> 20:13.579
I'm afraid meeting us all together
must be very intimidating.

20:14.259 --> 20:16.419
I do hope so.

20:32.979 --> 20:35.058
Now, please come this way.
Thank you.

20:35.059 --> 20:37.059
It's good to see you.

20:38.219 --> 20:40.699
Hello, Miss Swire, I'm Mary Crawley.

20:41.379 --> 20:44.578
Of course you are. I mean,
I've been longing to meet you

20:44.579 --> 20:47.098
because I've heard so much about you
from Matthew.

20:47.099 --> 20:49.339
Oh, that is...
Nice things, I hope.

20:49.859 --> 20:51.619
What else would she hear from me?

20:52.219 --> 20:54.219
Please.

20:55.019 --> 20:57.899
I can't say.
It's been such a long time.

20:58.339 --> 21:00.378
Who knows what you think of me now?

21:00.379 --> 21:02.258
I think...

21:02.259 --> 21:04.979
I'm very glad to see you looking
so well.

21:06.779 --> 21:08.818
All right, you win.

21:08.819 --> 21:10.858
We are at peace again.

21:10.859 --> 21:12.859
(ORCHESTRA STARTS PLAYING)

21:37.219 --> 21:39.218
Have you found something nice?

21:39.219 --> 21:40.979
Why, particularly?

21:41.819 --> 21:44.698
As a welcome home for Mr Matthew.

21:44.699 --> 21:46.738
(GRUNTS)
Oh, what's the matter?

21:46.739 --> 21:48.619
I'm thought you'd come round to him.

21:48.620 --> 21:51.858
Last time he was here, he hadn't
broken Lady Mary's heart.

21:51.859 --> 21:54.419
Lady Mary broke her own heart.

21:55.299 --> 21:57.898
That's if she has a heart to break.

21:57.899 --> 22:01.458
I don't think we're ever going to see
eye to eye on this, Mrs Hughes.

22:01.459 --> 22:04.218
She refused him when she thought
he'd have nothing.

22:04.219 --> 22:06.618
And when he was heir again,
she wanted him back.

22:06.619 --> 22:08.618
I thought caution was a virtue.

22:08.619 --> 22:11.739
Caution may be, self interest is
not.

22:12.899 --> 22:16.178
Perhaps Miss Swire is a gentler
person.

22:16.179 --> 22:18.578
If you ask me, this Miss Swire,

22:18.579 --> 22:22.098
who, it may interest you to know,
is not to be found in Burke's Peerage

22:22.099 --> 22:25.979
or Burke's Landed Gentry, has an eye
to the main chance.

22:26.419 --> 22:28.538
That's not snobbish, I suppose.

22:28.539 --> 22:30.898
I like to see things done properly,
Mrs Hughes,

22:30.899 --> 22:32.938
and I won't apologise for that.

22:32.939 --> 22:34.939
Now, if you'll excuse me.

22:47.619 --> 22:50.658
What is it?
A white feather, of course.

22:50.659 --> 22:52.659
Coward.

22:53.619 --> 22:55.778
Stop this at once!
(ORCHESTRA HALTS ABRUPTLY)

22:55.779 --> 22:57.778
This is neither the time
nor the place.

22:57.779 --> 23:00.778
These people should be aware
that there are cowards among them.

23:00.779 --> 23:03.979
Will you please leave?
You are the cowards here, not they!

23:17.419 --> 23:19.458
Leader, will you continue.

23:19.459 --> 23:21.459
(ORCHESTRA STARTS PLAYING)

23:29.139 --> 23:31.419
I'm in a uniform.
Wrong kind.

23:35.659 --> 23:38.938
That was horrid, William.
I hope you won't let it upset you.

23:38.939 --> 23:40.778
No, Your Ladyship.

23:40.779 --> 23:42.778
Why are these women so unkind?

23:42.779 --> 23:44.498
Of course it is horrid,

23:44.499 --> 23:46.817
but when heroes are giving their
lives every day,

23:46.818 --> 23:49.139
it's hard to watch healthy,
young men do nothing.

23:51.219 --> 23:54.138
By the way, Sybil, very good news,
they do have a vacancy.

23:54.139 --> 23:57.218
It's very short notice,
because someone dropped out.

23:57.219 --> 23:59.378
You'd have to be ready to start
on Friday.

23:59.379 --> 24:01.339
May I ask what this is about?

24:01.819 --> 24:05.139
Cousin Isobel has got me a place on
a nursing course in York.

24:08.219 --> 24:10.219
I want to work at the hospital.

24:11.899 --> 24:13.899
We don't have to talk about it now.

24:17.579 --> 24:19.818
She just turned up at my mother's
house.

24:19.819 --> 24:21.819
Not long before she died.

24:22.899 --> 24:25.299
So... what does it mean?

24:25.939 --> 24:29.458
I think it means, at long last...

24:29.459 --> 24:31.459
I'm able to get a divorce.

24:34.899 --> 24:37.458
Mr Bates...

24:37.459 --> 24:39.459
is this a proposal?

24:40.379 --> 24:42.379
If that's what you want to call it.

24:43.699 --> 24:45.699
And you might start calling me John.

24:48.019 --> 24:51.739
Well, why are you sure she'll do it
now, when she's refused for so long?

24:52.219 --> 24:55.138
Mother left me some money, much more
than I thought.

24:55.139 --> 24:58.498
Vera's a greedy woman, she won't
refuse what I can offer her.

24:58.499 --> 25:00.538
Will we have to leave Downton?

25:00.539 --> 25:03.418
Not until we want to.
I've spoken to His Lordship

25:03.419 --> 25:05.619
and he will find a cottage for us
near the house.

25:06.779 --> 25:09.099
You told him you want to marry me?
I did.

25:10.059 --> 25:12.059
Before you spoke to me?

25:13.579 --> 25:16.138
You don't mind, do you?
Of course I mind!

25:16.139 --> 25:17.858
In fact, I'd give you a smack

25:17.859 --> 25:20.179
if I didn't want to kiss you so much
I could burst.

25:40.876 --> 25:42.876
Branson says I'm ready for the road.

25:43.236 --> 25:45.075
That's not what he told me.

25:45.076 --> 25:47.155
Oh, how delicious, I love these.

25:47.156 --> 25:49.315
How did you and Matthew meet?

25:49.316 --> 25:53.275
Oh, in London. My father works in
London, so I've always lived there.

25:53.276 --> 25:55.915
But I love the country, too.
Of course you do.

25:55.916 --> 25:58.555
Daddy's a solicitor, like Matthew.

25:58.556 --> 26:02.996
My, my. You're very well placed if
you're ever in trouble with the law.

26:03.596 --> 26:05.715
Did I tell you I've been given
a colonelcy

26:05.716 --> 26:07.675
in the North Riding Volunteers?

26:07.676 --> 26:09.715
So I'm properly in the army again.

26:09.716 --> 26:11.716
Oh, congratulations.

26:13.436 --> 26:15.316
Yeah...
He won't go with them, will he?

26:15.317 --> 26:17.075
When they're called to the front.

26:17.076 --> 26:19.516
I hope not, but he seems to think
so.

26:22.516 --> 26:24.516
What's it been like?

26:30.276 --> 26:31.956
Do you know, the thing is...

26:34.996 --> 26:36.996
I just can't talk about it.

26:39.596 --> 26:41.635
Have you missed us?

26:41.636 --> 26:43.636
What do you think?

26:49.476 --> 26:51.436
You don't mind my bringing Lavinia?

26:52.316 --> 26:54.395
On the contrary, I'm glad.

26:54.396 --> 26:56.156
Glad to see you happy.

26:58.676 --> 27:01.595
What about you? Are you happy?

27:01.596 --> 27:05.156
I think I'm about to be happy.
Does that count?

27:06.436 --> 27:08.475
It does if you mean it.

27:08.476 --> 27:10.476
You'll be the first to know.

27:16.916 --> 27:18.916
What are reading?

27:19.436 --> 27:21.436
A photoplay about Mabel Normand.

27:22.196 --> 27:24.596
She was nothing when she started,
you know.

27:25.156 --> 27:27.635
Her father was a carpenter and
they'd no money.

27:27.636 --> 27:29.555
And now she's a shining film star.

27:29.556 --> 27:32.676
Ethel, I've a message for you
from Her Ladyship.

27:33.356 --> 27:35.435
You're to go up and she her now.

27:35.436 --> 27:37.635
What where?
In the drawing room, of course.

27:37.636 --> 27:40.235
They're all in the drawing room.
What have I done wrong?

27:40.236 --> 27:42.275
Nothing. Quite the reverse.

27:42.276 --> 27:44.395
She's very pleased with the way
you've begun

27:44.396 --> 27:46.195
and she wants to thank you.

27:46.196 --> 27:48.155
Now?
Yes, now.

27:48.156 --> 27:51.916
She's asked for you. How much longer
are you going to keep her waiting?

28:00.436 --> 28:02.595
I don't know much about
life in the country,

28:02.596 --> 28:04.436
but I do understand
how the law works,

28:04.437 --> 28:06.635
so I believe I can be helpful
to Matthew there.

28:06.636 --> 28:08.875
But you'll be immensely helpful.

28:08.876 --> 28:11.436
Don't you think so, Mary?
Of course.

28:15.316 --> 28:19.315
I beg your pardon, M'Lady,
for keeping you waiting. What?

28:19.316 --> 28:21.675
I'm ever so grateful for your
appreciation

28:21.676 --> 28:24.236
and I want you to know that it's
a privilege to work here.

28:29.036 --> 28:31.036
Ethel, what are you doing in here?

28:31.556 --> 28:33.556
Er... Her Ladyship sent for me.

28:34.436 --> 28:36.595
And who gave you this message?

28:36.596 --> 28:39.875
Miss O'Brien. She said I wasn't to
keep Her Ladyship waiting.

28:39.876 --> 28:42.635
You may go back downstairs now,
thank you, Ethel.

28:42.636 --> 28:44.595
Right.

28:44.596 --> 28:46.476
Thank you, M'Lady.

28:47.076 --> 28:49.115
Well...

28:49.116 --> 28:52.996
do we think she's mad, ill
or working for the Russians?

28:57.196 --> 28:59.115
She has plenty of time to learn.

28:59.116 --> 29:01.995
Cousin Robert will be in charge here
for many years.

29:01.996 --> 29:05.635
Lavinia will be a lawyer's wife far
longer than she'll be a countess.

29:05.636 --> 29:07.956
That's if I get through the war in
one piece.

29:08.476 --> 29:11.276
Of course you will.
Don't even think like that.

29:12.716 --> 29:15.355
How long are you staying in the
village? Just tomorrow.

29:15.356 --> 29:17.395
I take the six o'clock train on
Thursday.

29:17.396 --> 29:19.635
And then you'll be in France.

29:19.636 --> 29:23.636
Wherever I'm going, I'm so pleased
that we're friends again.

29:30.316 --> 29:33.756
I still don't understand why it was
funny to make me look a fool.

29:34.116 --> 29:36.795
You weren't even there to enjoy it.
Oh, don't worry.

29:36.796 --> 29:38.955
We enjoyed it all right from down
here.

29:38.956 --> 29:42.635
Miss O'Brien, Her Ladyship has asked
me to take the incident no further.

29:42.636 --> 29:44.635
Don't tempt me to disobey.

29:44.636 --> 29:47.195
Did I see Lady Sybil in the kitchen
yesterday?

29:47.196 --> 29:48.915
She wants to learn some cooking.

29:48.916 --> 29:50.915
She says she's going to train to be
a nurse,

29:50.916 --> 29:53.595
so she needs to know how to cook
and clean and everything.

29:53.596 --> 29:56.915
Has she told Her Ladyship about this?
It's supposed to be a surprise.

29:56.916 --> 29:58.955
Mr Carson, it speaks well
of Lady Sybil

29:58.956 --> 30:02.076
that she wants to help the wounded.
Let's not give her away.

30:03.116 --> 30:05.395
Why shouldn't she learn how to cook
and scrub?

30:05.396 --> 30:07.236
She may need it when the war's over.

30:07.237 --> 30:10.195
Things are changing,
for her lot and us.

30:10.196 --> 30:12.595
And when they do, I mean to make
the most of it.

30:12.596 --> 30:14.596
(MRS PATMORE SNIGGERS)

30:15.396 --> 30:18.275
I take it they ate all the pancakes
last night, then?

30:18.276 --> 30:20.276
They did.

30:24.436 --> 30:26.436
(WHISTLES)

30:26.956 --> 30:28.956
Here you are.

30:31.596 --> 30:33.435
What are we aiming at?

30:33.436 --> 30:35.795
They'd like us to take 100 wounded
men.

30:35.796 --> 30:38.436
Three times the number the hospital
was built for.

30:38.876 --> 30:42.395
Well, that settles it. We'll have to
convert the second day room.

30:42.396 --> 30:44.675
So there's to be no convalescence at
all?

30:44.676 --> 30:47.715
I'm afraid not. Once they can stand,
they must go.

30:47.716 --> 30:51.035
If only there was somewhere nearer
than Farley Hall.

30:51.036 --> 30:53.836
I can't get there more than twice
a week at the most.

30:55.996 --> 30:57.996
Ah, should he be doing that?

30:59.516 --> 31:02.115
Why not?
I only meant with his condition.

31:02.116 --> 31:04.595
What condition is that?
His lungs.

31:04.596 --> 31:07.875
Old Lady Grantham told me he's had
a lot of trouble with his lungs.

31:07.876 --> 31:10.355
And why did she tell you that,
particularly?

31:10.356 --> 31:12.595
She wanted me to write to the
War Office.

31:12.596 --> 31:14.715
She was anxious to spare him the
humiliation

31:14.716 --> 31:16.556
of being refused on medical grounds.

31:16.557 --> 31:19.395
And who else did she wish you to
take under your protection?

31:19.396 --> 31:21.836
William Mason, the footman at
the big house.

31:22.916 --> 31:26.556
He has a bad skin condition,
apparently, and hates people to know.

31:29.396 --> 31:32.076
She wanted to spare him the physical
examination.

31:32.796 --> 31:34.636
I'm sure she did.

31:36.876 --> 31:39.196
What in Wonderland do you call that?!

31:40.036 --> 31:43.875
I mean, I do not fully understand
what you're trying to do, M'Lady.

31:43.876 --> 31:46.195
Oh, I knew it wasn't supposed to
look like this.

31:46.196 --> 31:48.395
No, M'Lady. I would go so far as to
say

31:48.396 --> 31:52.156
there is no food on the Earth
that is supposed to look like that.

31:56.076 --> 31:58.076
Why does everything go so lumpy?

31:58.716 --> 32:01.396
Tell you what, chuck it out and
we'll start again.

32:07.116 --> 32:10.476
I don't think we should sell your
mother's house, not yet.

32:11.636 --> 32:14.276
We could rent it out.
Then we can save.

32:15.676 --> 32:18.956
When I've some time off, I'll go up
to London and get it ready.

32:20.556 --> 32:22.556
Maybe I can come with you.

32:22.956 --> 32:24.756
We could do it together.

32:27.596 --> 32:29.716
I've got an idea,
that a bit later on...

32:31.756 --> 32:33.475
if we want to...

32:33.476 --> 32:35.796
if we want to start a family.

32:36.956 --> 32:40.835
I thought, when the time is right,
we might sell.

32:40.836 --> 32:43.715
And we could buy a small hotel.

32:43.716 --> 32:47.155
Just... just a little one.

32:47.156 --> 32:49.195
Maybe near here.

32:49.196 --> 32:52.676
Then we could work together and
have the children with us.

32:54.396 --> 32:57.076
What is it?
Nothing, it's just...

32:58.716 --> 33:00.755
in my whole life, I never thought

33:00.756 --> 33:03.156
I could be as happy
as I am at this moment.

33:41.596 --> 33:45.195
Don't worry, I haven't come to undo
your good work of the other night.

33:45.196 --> 33:47.195
You must have been up before
the servants.

33:47.196 --> 33:49.236
They were rather surprised to see me.

33:51.396 --> 33:53.396
I wanted to give you this.

33:53.956 --> 33:55.995
It's my lucky charm.

33:55.996 --> 33:57.835
I've had it always.

33:57.836 --> 34:00.716
So you must promise to bring it back,
without a scratch.

34:02.596 --> 34:05.316
Won't you need it?
Not as much as you.

34:06.556 --> 34:08.556
So look after it, please.

34:09.835 --> 34:12.594
I'll try not to be a hero,
if that's what you're afraid of.

34:12.596 --> 34:14.436
Just come back, safe and sound.

34:16.996 --> 34:19.556
Did you have a happy time yesterday?

34:20.996 --> 34:24.716
I showed Lavinia the places I like
most. To give her a few memories.

34:26.876 --> 34:28.835
Mary, if I don't come back -
But - No.

34:28.837 --> 34:30.635
If I don't.

34:30.636 --> 34:32.675
Then do remember how very glad I am

34:32.676 --> 34:34.835
that we made up when we had the
chance.

34:34.835 --> 34:36.875
I mean it.

34:36.876 --> 34:38.795
You send me off to war a happy man.

34:42.436 --> 34:44.475
Will you do something for me?

34:44.476 --> 34:46.514
Will you...

34:46.516 --> 34:49.915
Will you look after Mother,
if anything happens?

34:49.916 --> 34:52.114
Of course we will, but it won't.

34:52.116 --> 34:53.835
And Lavinia.

34:53.835 --> 34:57.475
She's young, she'll find someone
else, I hop she does anyway.

34:57.476 --> 35:00.395
But... until she does.

35:00.396 --> 35:02.396
(WHISTLE)

35:03.596 --> 35:05.596
Goodbye, then.

35:08.476 --> 35:10.476
And such good luck.

35:11.436 --> 35:13.475
Goodbye, Mary.

35:13.476 --> 35:15.476
And God bless you.

35:55.190 --> 35:59.029
Lady Mary was very much part of the
story, I can assure you.

35:59.030 --> 36:00.909
But how do you know?

36:00.910 --> 36:03.430
Well, you see I worked for Lady Flin-
Ethel...

36:04.750 --> 36:07.150
I hope you've offered our visitor
some tea.

36:08.150 --> 36:10.150
I'll go and ask Daisy.

36:11.910 --> 36:13.909
What is the first law of service?

36:13.910 --> 36:17.149
We do not discuss the business of
this house with strangers.

36:17.150 --> 36:20.709
But she's not a stranger.
She's Mr Bates' wife.

36:20.710 --> 36:22.710
Has anyone told him she's here?

36:34.870 --> 36:36.909
So you're Anna.

36:36.910 --> 36:38.910
I am.

36:40.670 --> 36:44.429
You're the one who went to call on
my late, lamented mother-in-law.

36:44.430 --> 36:46.469
Yes, I did.

36:46.470 --> 36:48.710
I know you did.

36:53.390 --> 36:55.270
Sorry to keep you waiting, Vera.

36:57.470 --> 37:00.149
I was up in the attics, sorting out
some cupboards.

37:00.150 --> 37:02.549
Don't worry. I've been having
a nice time

37:02.550 --> 37:04.670
here with Ethel and Miss Smith.

37:05.550 --> 37:09.229
Mr Bates, Ethel told me about your
visitor.

37:09.230 --> 37:11.469
So I've had the tea put in my
sitting room.

37:11.470 --> 37:13.710
I thought you might take Mrs Bates
in there.

37:14.470 --> 37:16.669
That's very thoughtful.
It is.

37:16.670 --> 37:19.750
But then you're all so kind.

37:20.710 --> 37:23.870
I'm beginning to understand why
my Batesy's got so spoiled.

37:31.110 --> 37:33.149
I'm sorry to trouble you, My Lady.

37:33.150 --> 37:36.229
What is it, Carson?
Something has been going on

37:36.230 --> 37:39.789
and I don't feel quite easy that
you've not been made aware of it.

37:39.790 --> 37:42.589
Goodness. What is this dark secret?

37:42.590 --> 37:46.949
Lady Sybil has spent
the last two days in the kitchen.

37:46.950 --> 37:50.629
What? She asked Mrs Patmore
for some cooking lessons.

37:50.630 --> 37:54.149
Now, steady. Even the most
experience cook can burn themself

37:54.150 --> 37:56.909
if they're not careful.
Do you think it's ready?

37:56.910 --> 38:00.110
I know it's ready.
Go on, you don't want to spoil it.

38:01.110 --> 38:05.109
It seems she's made a cake for
Your Ladyship, as a surprise.

38:05.110 --> 38:07.949
But I'm uneasy with surprises
at the best of times

38:07.950 --> 38:12.310
and I wonder if the whole exercise
is entirely appropriate. Ta-dah!

38:15.350 --> 38:18.750
I'm not comfortable with this,
My Lady. Not comfortable at all.

38:20.750 --> 38:23.990
I was worried about Lady Sybil,
but I'm not worried any more.

38:24.990 --> 38:26.990
So you don't mind, My Lady?

38:28.710 --> 38:30.710
No.

38:31.350 --> 38:33.190
I do not mind.

38:33.910 --> 38:36.150
And I'm very grateful to you.

38:37.710 --> 38:41.389
And, Carson, the cake will be a
surprise whether you approve or not.

38:41.390 --> 38:43.390
So please don't give me away.

38:53.510 --> 38:55.990
Sit down.
I don't want to sit down.

38:56.910 --> 38:58.910
Suit yourself.

39:01.670 --> 39:05.349
Look, I'm not saying it's all your
fault for how things were between us.

39:05.350 --> 39:07.509
But I couldn't go back to that.

39:07.510 --> 39:11.150
I'll take the blame. I'll go to some
hotel in Malton with a tart.

39:13.590 --> 39:15.590
So why hold on?

39:16.030 --> 39:18.550
Because I tried it on my own
and I don't like it.

39:19.870 --> 39:22.270
You've got money now,
we'd be comfortable.

39:24.390 --> 39:26.269
You're out of your mind.

39:26.270 --> 39:28.869
What makes you think that I would
allow that to happen?

39:28.870 --> 39:30.870
You went to prison for me once.

39:34.070 --> 39:36.070
I must say, this is very good.

39:36.790 --> 39:38.949
Does Lord Grantham have his own
blend?

39:38.950 --> 39:41.270
Is that all?
Not quite.

39:42.870 --> 39:44.668
You see, if you don't come back to
me,

39:44.669 --> 39:47.110
I'm going to the newspapers with
a cracking story

39:47.111 --> 39:49.709
and I'd like to bet the Grantham's
won't survive it.

39:49.710 --> 39:52.709
Oh? And what nonsense is this?

39:52.710 --> 39:54.749
The nonsense I heard when I used
your name

39:54.750 --> 39:57.549
to get a job with Lady Flintshire,
his Lordship's cousin.

39:57.550 --> 39:59.990
I know who Lady Flintshire is.
Well, when I arrived,

39:59.991 --> 40:01.709
her maid asked me if it was true.

40:01.710 --> 40:04.110
About Lady Mary Crawley and the
Turkish diplomat.

40:04.111 --> 40:06.389
They thought I'd know, you see,
being your wife.

40:06.390 --> 40:08.550
I hope you told them you knew nothing
about it.

40:10.750 --> 40:13.350
Oh... As if.

40:14.390 --> 40:17.429
I said, 'Why don't you tell me what
you think you know

40:17.430 --> 40:19.430
and I'll tell you if it's true.'

40:20.190 --> 40:22.229
Goodness me.

40:22.230 --> 40:24.269
Wasn't my patience rewarded.

40:24.270 --> 40:26.789
The public's bored with the war,
you see.

40:26.790 --> 40:28.709
They like gossip.

40:28.710 --> 40:32.029
And a diplomat dying in the bed of
an earl's unmarried daughter,

40:32.030 --> 40:35.509
well, that takes the ticket for the
tale of the year.

40:35.510 --> 40:39.309
It's a pack of lies! I assume
that's loyalty and not ignorance.

40:39.310 --> 40:41.549
Because, you see, I heard
that Lady Mary needed

40:41.550 --> 40:44.269
her maid to help her carry him and,
yes, you've guessed it,

40:44.270 --> 40:46.869
your precious Anna's going to figure
in the story, too.

40:46.870 --> 40:50.469
Not to worry too much.
It's not a criminal offence, is it?

40:50.470 --> 40:52.310
Just a social one.

40:55.910 --> 40:59.149
You bitch.
Please, be my guest.

40:59.150 --> 41:00.869
But then you must excuse me

41:00.870 --> 41:03.070
while I run into town and have it
photographed.

41:13.190 --> 41:15.189
What do you want from me?

41:15.190 --> 41:17.549
Firstly, hand in your notice...

41:17.550 --> 41:19.269
tonight.

41:19.270 --> 41:21.150
I'll put up at the pub in the
village.

41:21.151 --> 41:23.749
And what reason do I give?
You don't need a reason.

41:23.750 --> 41:25.789
Just tell them that you're going.

41:25.790 --> 41:28.069
And then tomorrow we head back to
London.

41:28.070 --> 41:30.550
We'll stay in your mother's house
for the time being,

41:30.551 --> 41:32.349
till we get ourselves sorted.

41:32.350 --> 41:35.790
And in case you're wondering,
whatever my future plans may be,

41:35.910 --> 41:37.910
they will involve you.

41:53.470 --> 41:56.269
Bates, when you first came here,
I fought to keep you!

41:56.270 --> 41:59.629
Everyone was against me, everyone,
from Her Ladyship to Carson.

41:59.630 --> 42:01.909
They thought I was mad.
But I said to them,

42:01.910 --> 42:04.229
'After all that we've been through,
Bates and I,

42:04.230 --> 42:07.149
I owe him my loyalty!'
I appreciate that, M'Lord, but...

42:07.150 --> 42:10.989
But what? But loyalty doesn't matter
to you? It does matter, M'Lord.

42:10.990 --> 42:13.589
Not enough to make you change your
mind. Not even enough

42:13.590 --> 42:15.869
to make you stay until I've found
a replacement!

42:15.870 --> 42:19.149
I can't. You won't take any more
money off me. You leave empty-handed!

42:19.150 --> 42:21.150
I don't want money, M'Lord.

42:21.430 --> 42:23.228
I'm sorry, Bates, that was a low
shot.

42:23.229 --> 42:25.550
Of course you can have whatever is
owning to you.

42:28.870 --> 42:30.990
I thought we were friends,
that's all.

42:32.310 --> 42:35.269
I thought we'd crossed the great
divide, successfully.

42:35.270 --> 42:38.309
Well, I've had my say,
it's your life.

42:38.310 --> 42:40.469
But you've disappointed me, Bates.

42:40.470 --> 42:43.670
I cannot remember being more
disappointed in any man.

42:47.110 --> 42:49.389
I don't believe it.
You say my life is over

42:49.390 --> 42:52.109
and your wife will collect you first
thing and that's it?

42:52.110 --> 42:54.349
Have you mentioned this to anyone
else?

42:54.350 --> 42:56.350
Only Mr Carson and Mrs Hughes.

42:56.830 --> 42:58.949
The others can find out when
I've gone.

42:58.950 --> 43:01.669
I know you've not told me the real
reason. You're wrong.

43:01.670 --> 43:03.749
Vera has reminded me
that I'm a married man.

43:03.750 --> 43:05.510
I must give my vows another chance.

43:05.511 --> 43:08.189
I had not right to involve you in
my life. Yes, but you see,

43:08.190 --> 43:10.869
that's just what I don't agree with.
You had every right.

43:10.870 --> 43:13.749
I know you.
You're doing something gallant here,

43:13.750 --> 43:16.589
making a sacrifice for my honour,
but I don't want you to.

43:16.590 --> 43:18.629
I don't care. Don't you understand?

43:18.630 --> 43:20.669
I don't care what people say.

43:20.670 --> 43:22.709
I'd live in sin with you.

43:22.710 --> 43:26.389
If she's threatening to ruin me,
then let her. It's nothing to me.

43:26.390 --> 43:29.029
The only ruin that I recognise is to
be without you.

43:29.030 --> 43:30.789
Forget me and be happy, please.

43:30.790 --> 43:33.150
I couldn't. Not ever.

43:35.950 --> 43:38.750
You should and you must.

43:40.870 --> 43:42.870
I am nothing.

43:55.310 --> 43:57.550
William? I thought everyone had gone
up.

43:58.630 --> 44:01.670
I'm just looking for that magazine
Ethel were reading.

44:04.390 --> 44:07.749
I hope you've noticed I'm not scared
of electricity any more.

44:07.750 --> 44:11.069
Well, not much. I couldn't touch
a switch when it were only upstairs,

44:11.070 --> 44:13.070
but I've got used to it now.

44:13.750 --> 44:15.750
I hate to see you like this.

44:16.390 --> 44:18.229
Even though I'm a dirty coward?

44:18.230 --> 44:20.269
You're not. Not to me.

44:20.270 --> 44:22.229
But why don't I enlist?

44:22.230 --> 44:24.269
I could.

44:24.270 --> 44:26.989
I know I promised my dad,
but he's not my owner.

44:26.990 --> 44:28.990
He's not the law.

44:29.910 --> 44:33.149
Am I frightened?
Is that it, honestly?

44:33.150 --> 44:35.189
Don't be so hard on yourself.

44:35.190 --> 44:37.190
No-one wants to go to war.

44:38.830 --> 44:41.910
Oh, I wish you'd cheer up, please.

44:42.870 --> 44:44.909
I'd do anything to cheer you up.

44:44.910 --> 44:46.910
Like what?

44:48.510 --> 44:50.510
Like this.

44:58.630 --> 45:00.389
You just feel sorry for me.

45:00.390 --> 45:02.429
William, I've kissed you!

45:02.430 --> 45:05.510
You've wanted me to long enough.
Well, now I have. Enjoy it.

45:07.110 --> 45:09.149
Does this mean you'll be my girl?

45:09.150 --> 45:12.470
Daisy? Cos if you were my girl,
I know I could tackle anything.

45:28.070 --> 45:30.989
We were supposed to be at rest for
ten days at least.

45:30.990 --> 45:33.269
Orders arrived this morning, sir.

45:33.270 --> 45:36.310
The King's Own were hit bad,
so they're out and we're in.

45:36.910 --> 45:40.829
They've been shelling the trench
since we got here. Anybody hurt?

45:40.830 --> 45:44.310
Rankin's dead and
Kent and Corporal Wright was hit.

45:45.110 --> 45:47.429
Thank God the stretcher bearers were
there.

45:47.430 --> 45:49.470
Let's see what the damage is now.
Sir.

45:58.390 --> 46:00.230
All right?
Morning, sir.

46:06.830 --> 46:08.550
Look out!

46:14.510 --> 46:16.510
Medic!

46:17.230 --> 46:19.549
Thomas?

46:19.550 --> 46:22.670
It is Thomas, isn't it?
Corporal Barrow now, Mr Crawley.

46:24.470 --> 46:26.830
You'll never guess
where I've just been.

46:46.230 --> 46:50.709
Where's Anna? She's not feeling very
well today, Your Ladyship.

46:50.710 --> 46:52.789
I've taken over for the time being.

46:52.790 --> 46:54.829
Oh, that's so kind of you.

46:54.830 --> 46:57.229
Just make sure Lady Sybil packs
things

46:57.230 --> 46:59.669
she can get in and out of
without a maid.

46:59.670 --> 47:03.069
Oh, I don't need that.
I'd never wear it.

47:03.070 --> 47:06.389
But you must have something decent.
Suppose you're invited to dinner?

47:06.390 --> 47:08.110
I know this is hard for you to
grasp,

47:08.111 --> 47:10.709
but I'm not there to go out to
dinner. I'm there to learn.

47:10.710 --> 47:12.710
Take one, just in case.

47:14.070 --> 47:17.469
We'll miss you. Don't be silly,
it's only two months.

47:17.470 --> 47:19.509
And I'll come home if I can.

47:19.510 --> 47:23.349
Why don't I drive you? She's taking
enough chance with her life as it is.

47:23.350 --> 47:25.389
Oh, Granny.

47:25.390 --> 47:28.789
What is this driving mania?
It'll be useful.

47:28.790 --> 47:32.109
They won't let a healthy man drive
us around for much longer.

47:32.110 --> 47:34.909
And if Sybil can be a nurse,
why can't I be a chauffeur?

47:34.910 --> 47:37.389
Well, I shall leave you.

47:37.390 --> 47:41.270
I have been summoned by Cousin Isobel
for tea.

47:42.150 --> 47:45.269
Goodbye, Sybil.
And good luck with it all.

47:45.270 --> 47:47.190
Thank you for being such a sport.

47:47.870 --> 47:50.310
It's a big step you're taking, dear.

47:51.070 --> 47:54.510
But war deals out strange tasks.

47:55.150 --> 47:57.150
Remember your great aunt, Roberta.

47:57.590 --> 47:59.349
What about her?

47:59.350 --> 48:02.510
She loaded the guns at Lucknow.

48:04.070 --> 48:07.030
I'll come with you.
I'll tell William to fetch the bags.

48:09.590 --> 48:11.590
The first of you to leave the nest.

48:13.470 --> 48:16.949
Poor Mama. She always feels
these things so dreadfully.

48:16.950 --> 48:18.989
That's her American blood.

48:18.990 --> 48:22.189
I'm so glad we've settled everything
with Cousin Matthew.

48:22.190 --> 48:25.389
Aren't you, Mary? Oh, please
stop treading on eggshells.

48:25.390 --> 48:27.390
I've other fish to fry.

48:54.694 --> 48:56.733
I make no apology.

48:56.734 --> 49:01.373
It would be a terrible thing if poor,
old Mr Molesley's son were killed.

49:01.374 --> 49:03.693
Wouldn't it, Molesley?
I'm sure it would, but...

49:03.694 --> 49:06.933
And then I heard William's father

49:06.934 --> 49:10.454
would be left on his own if anything
happened to the boy.

49:11.054 --> 49:14.573
And what would become of Carson if
the last of his staff were to go?

49:14.574 --> 49:17.253
That's not the point.
Do you want Molesley to die?

49:17.254 --> 49:18.973
Of course I don't!
Well.

49:18.974 --> 49:20.934
I don't want my own son to die,
either.

49:20.935 --> 49:23.373
But this is a war and we must be in
it together!

49:23.374 --> 49:25.253
High and low, rich and poor.

49:25.254 --> 49:27.373
There can be no special cases,

49:27.374 --> 49:30.813
because every man at the front
is a special case to someone.

49:30.814 --> 49:32.533
Mrs Crawley is right.

49:32.534 --> 49:34.613
I understand your motives,
Lady Grantham,

49:34.614 --> 49:36.333
and I do not criticise them.

49:36.334 --> 49:39.733
Thank you. But I shall write
to the Ministry at once,

49:39.734 --> 49:41.853
correcting the misinformation.

49:41.854 --> 49:43.694
Good day. I'll see myself out.

49:44.934 --> 49:47.413
Molesley, you understand why I said
what I did?

49:47.414 --> 49:49.214
Indeed. I do, ma'am.

49:50.934 --> 49:53.173
You won't be called up at once.

49:53.174 --> 49:55.613
Not while there are younger men to
be taken.

49:55.614 --> 49:58.534
But they'll get you in the end,
Molesley.

49:59.934 --> 50:02.534
And you can blame Mrs Crawley
when they do.

50:06.054 --> 50:09.214
I wish you'd stop working
for one minute.

50:09.894 --> 50:13.014
At least put the light on,
or you'll strain your eyes.

50:14.614 --> 50:17.134
It's getting dark so early now.

50:18.254 --> 50:20.574
Has she gone?
She has.

50:21.374 --> 50:25.453
So... we've lost Mr Bates
and Lady Sybil in one day.

50:25.454 --> 50:27.533
I can't believe it.

50:27.534 --> 50:30.014
I suppose I'll have to look after
His Lordship now,

50:30.015 --> 50:32.533
on top of everything else.
And I don't want any jokes

50:32.534 --> 50:34.934
about broomsticks and sweeping
the floor.

50:35.654 --> 50:39.053
His Lordship's got his regimental
dinner in Richmond tonight.

50:39.054 --> 50:41.654
That means he'll be in the full fig.
You'll manage.

50:42.934 --> 50:45.733
You know, when Mr Bates first came
to this house,

50:45.734 --> 50:47.694
I thought he could never do the work.

50:47.695 --> 50:50.173
But now I can't imagine the place
without him.

50:50.174 --> 50:52.294
Did you see this coming?
Because I didn't.

50:52.974 --> 50:55.013
I have a confession.

50:55.014 --> 50:57.453
I let them have their tea
in my sitting room.

50:57.454 --> 51:00.453
That was nice of you.
It was quite nice.

51:00.454 --> 51:02.454
But I had my reasons.

51:04.974 --> 51:06.893
There's a grating on the wall

51:06.894 --> 51:09.734
which means you can hear what's
being said in the room.

51:10.814 --> 51:13.733
Now if I was a gentleman,
I wouldn't want to know.

51:13.734 --> 51:15.773
But you're not.

51:15.774 --> 51:17.774
Fortunately.

51:41.854 --> 51:43.733
It'll be hard to let you go.

51:43.734 --> 51:45.454
My last link with home.

51:46.534 --> 51:48.494
Not as hard as it is for me.

51:49.174 --> 51:52.733
Branson - I know I shouldn't say it,
but I can't keep it in any longer.

51:52.734 --> 51:56.173
I wish you would. I told myself and
told myself, you're too far above me.

51:56.174 --> 51:58.373
But things are changing.
When the war is over,

51:58.374 --> 52:01.093
the world won't be the same place
as it was when it started.

52:01.094 --> 52:04.053
And I'll make something of myself,
I promise. I know you will.

52:04.054 --> 52:06.493
Then bet on me.

52:06.494 --> 52:09.213
And if your family casts you off,
it won't be forever.

52:09.214 --> 52:12.653
They'll come around.
And until they do,

52:12.654 --> 52:16.654
I promise to devote every waking
minute to your happiness.

52:18.534 --> 52:20.813
I'm terribly flattered.

52:20.814 --> 52:23.254
Don't say that.
Why not?

52:24.214 --> 52:26.453
Because 'flattered' is a word posh
people use

52:26.454 --> 52:28.254
when they're getting ready to say no.

52:29.734 --> 52:31.933
That sounds more like you.

52:31.934 --> 52:33.973
Please don't make fun of me.

52:33.974 --> 52:37.814
No. It's cost me all I've got
to say these things.

52:44.374 --> 52:46.374
Right.

52:47.414 --> 52:49.293
I'll go. I'll hand in my notice

52:49.294 --> 52:52.213
and I won't be there when you get
back - No, don't do that.

52:52.214 --> 52:55.574
I must. They won't let me stay
when they've heard what I've said.

52:56.974 --> 52:58.974
They won't hear.

52:59.734 --> 53:01.734
Not from me.

53:11.294 --> 53:14.334
Bloody hell.
There must be more to life than this.

53:21.414 --> 53:23.414
You all right, Corporal?

53:26.734 --> 53:29.374
I think so. Yeah, more or less.

53:38.094 --> 53:40.133
My God.

53:40.134 --> 53:42.893
They won't believe it back home
where I come from.

53:42.894 --> 53:46.853
I thought, 'Medical Corps,
not much danger there.'

53:46.854 --> 53:48.854
How wrong can one man be?

53:50.094 --> 53:52.094
Here.

53:52.454 --> 53:54.613
I think it comes down to luck.

53:54.614 --> 53:58.293
If a bullet's got your name on it,
there's nothing you can do.

53:58.294 --> 54:01.654
If not, then thank God you were
lucky...

54:07.894 --> 54:09.894
Get these bodies away!

54:10.854 --> 54:12.854
Come on, Corporal Barrow!

54:20.974 --> 54:24.013
I cannot tell you how pleased I am to
be here tonight, sir.

54:24.014 --> 54:26.454
Oh, we are very pleased to have you
here, Grantham.

54:26.455 --> 54:30.254
You see, just to know that I'm with
you all, to sense that I belong here.

54:31.534 --> 54:34.374
It's as simple as this,
I no longer feel like a fraud.

54:39.014 --> 54:41.413
Mr Molesley, what are you doing
here?

54:41.414 --> 54:44.293
I was waiting to see you, Doctor.
How can I help?

54:44.294 --> 54:47.293
It's just I was wondering whether
you'd written that letter.

54:47.294 --> 54:50.213
The one you spoke of this afternoon.
To the War Office?

54:50.214 --> 54:52.893
Not yet. I'm sorry
you were involved in all that.

54:52.894 --> 54:55.693
I should've checked with you first,
before I interfered.

54:55.694 --> 54:58.453
That's just it. You see, I think if
you had checked with me,

54:58.454 --> 55:01.133
you'd have found exactly what
Lady Grantham described.

55:01.134 --> 55:03.373
I don't quite...
I have trouble with my lungs.

55:03.374 --> 55:05.413
I get so...

55:05.414 --> 55:07.453
breathless sometimes.

55:07.454 --> 55:09.493
And...

55:09.494 --> 55:12.014
I've noticed it's getting worse.

55:16.654 --> 55:20.093
They haven't written to William yet.

55:20.094 --> 55:23.334
The Ministry, I mean.
But they have discharged me.

55:24.974 --> 55:26.814
Won't it just make extra work for
them

55:26.815 --> 55:28.614
to have to fail me all over again?

55:29.094 --> 55:31.133
Very well.

55:31.134 --> 55:33.893
I shall correct my statement as
regards William,

55:33.894 --> 55:36.374
but make no mention of you.
Thank you, Doctor.

55:37.614 --> 55:39.653
It's all right.

55:39.654 --> 55:41.693
But, Molesley...

55:41.694 --> 55:45.174
I hope you will help the war effort,
in other ways.

55:48.894 --> 55:51.893
When might the regiment be wanted,
sir?

55:51.894 --> 55:54.253
The talk at dinner suggested
it would be soon.

55:54.254 --> 55:56.293
Oh, pretty soon, I'd say.

55:56.294 --> 55:59.934
Well, I'm as ready now
as I'll ever be.

56:01.254 --> 56:04.333
For what?
To go to France, with the regiment.

56:04.334 --> 56:06.373
Why would you do that?

56:06.374 --> 56:08.533
Because I'm their colonel, of course.

56:08.534 --> 56:10.813
Well, there must be some use for me
over there.

56:10.814 --> 56:13.813
My dear fellow, we're not as
heartless as that!

56:13.814 --> 56:17.894
The position's only an honorary one.
Nobody expects you to go to war.

56:18.654 --> 56:21.533
An honorary one? We thought
it'd cheer things up a bit

56:21.534 --> 56:23.813
to have the Lord Lieutenant
at our table.

56:23.814 --> 56:26.574
And so it does. We're very glad
to welcome to you here.

56:28.134 --> 56:31.893
I see. We old codgers
have our work cut out for us

56:31.894 --> 56:34.733
keeping spirits high at home.
Someone must.

56:34.734 --> 56:37.933
Oh, indeed, sir.
Is that Taxi Cavendish?

56:37.934 --> 56:39.934
I must catch him before I go.

56:46.829 --> 56:49.069
So Lady Sybil got off all right in
the end.

56:49.949 --> 56:52.788
I'm afraid we have to admit
she knows what she wants.

56:52.789 --> 56:54.708
Yes. She certainly does.

56:54.709 --> 56:57.069
I don't suppose the war will leave
any of us alone

56:57.070 --> 56:58.909
by the time it's done.

56:59.589 --> 57:01.828
I got a letter from Thomas the other
day.

57:01.829 --> 57:04.628
He writes that when he thinks about
how things used to be,

57:04.629 --> 57:06.629
it seems like a dream.

57:07.349 --> 57:09.309
It's not much more than two years
ago,

57:09.310 --> 57:11.428
but he says it might as well be a
century.

57:11.429 --> 57:13.869
So you hear from Thomas. Is he well?

57:14.349 --> 57:16.388
Please give him my regards.

57:16.389 --> 57:18.389
He's well enough, M'Lady.

57:19.189 --> 57:21.428
But I don't think he'd mind coming
home.

57:21.429 --> 57:23.429
Oh, how I wish he could, O'Brien.

57:25.149 --> 57:27.589
Of course, if Bates hadn't been so
bloody selfish,

57:27.590 --> 57:30.548
he would have let us plan for his
departure properly.

57:30.549 --> 57:35.268
Your Lordship, I have information
that I have no proper claim to.

57:35.269 --> 57:37.308
Well, what is it?

57:37.309 --> 57:41.268
Well, if Your Lordship can assure me
that you will keep it to yourself?

57:41.269 --> 57:44.909
I promise, Carson.
You can drop the last veil.

57:46.069 --> 57:48.508
Well, I feel it only right to tell
you

57:48.509 --> 57:51.228
that Mr Bates' leaving was not
selfish.

57:51.229 --> 57:53.949
Quite the reverse.
It felt selfish to me.

57:54.949 --> 57:58.349
As for the wretched Anna,
bedizened with dishonest promises.

57:59.429 --> 58:02.188
Mr Bates left because had he not
done so,

58:02.189 --> 58:05.868
his wife was planning to engulf
this house in scandal.

58:05.869 --> 58:07.869
Scandal?

58:09.109 --> 58:11.108
What scandal?
The point is, My Lord,

58:11.109 --> 58:13.668
Mrs Bates would have made Downton
notorious.

58:13.669 --> 58:17.228
The price of her silence was her
husband's return.

58:17.229 --> 58:20.068
But I must know what story she was
planning to tell.

58:20.069 --> 58:22.188
I'm sorry, My Lord,
I could not speak of it

58:22.189 --> 58:24.469
without injuring you and
betraying myself.

58:25.429 --> 58:27.988
But you are saying that Bates
fell on his sword

58:27.989 --> 58:30.189
to protect the reputation
of my family?

58:44.269 --> 58:46.269
Ethel, what are you doing?

58:46.949 --> 58:48.988
Seeing to the plugs for the night.

58:48.989 --> 58:52.588
What? Polishing the electric plugs
and checking them for vapours.

58:52.589 --> 58:54.628
And why are you doing this?

58:54.629 --> 58:56.668
Because you were too busy.

58:56.669 --> 58:59.828
She said you usually did it,
but could I manage it tonight.

58:59.829 --> 59:02.789
And 'she', I take it,
would be Miss O'Brien?

59:05.029 --> 59:06.908
Go to bed, Ethel.

59:06.909 --> 59:10.469
Next time she gives you an order,
ask me first.

59:18.309 --> 59:21.108
Is anything the matter?
Nothing.

59:21.109 --> 59:25.028
Except that today has shown me
I'm not only a worthless man,

59:25.029 --> 59:27.508
but also a bad-tempered and
ungrateful one.

59:27.509 --> 59:29.509
Well, we all know that.

59:32.949 --> 59:34.949
Can I help?

59:38.709 --> 59:40.709
I wonder how Sybil's feeling.

59:40.789 --> 59:43.308
The war's reaching its long fingers
into Downton

59:43.309 --> 59:45.148
and scattering our chicks.

59:45.149 --> 59:47.148
But I'm glad we made peace
with Matthew.

59:47.149 --> 59:50.068
I agree.
Let us thank Sir Richard Carlisle

59:50.069 --> 59:52.789
for distracting Mary
at just the right moment.

59:54.189 --> 59:57.428
By the way, she wants him to come
and stay. So we can all meet him.

59:57.429 --> 01:00:01.508
She wants us to invite a hawker of
newspaper scandal

01:00:01.509 --> 01:00:03.548
to stay as a guest in this house?

01:00:03.549 --> 01:00:05.549
It's lucky I have a sense of irony.

01:00:09.989 --> 01:00:11.989
(SNIFFLING)

01:00:15.749 --> 01:00:17.749
Not you, too.

01:00:30.589 --> 01:00:32.628
What's the matter?

01:00:32.629 --> 01:00:34.389
Why ask? You don't care.

01:00:35.309 --> 01:00:37.348
Ethel...

01:00:37.349 --> 01:00:40.588
Perhaps if you stopped going on
about all the marvellous things

01:00:40.589 --> 01:00:42.709
you're going to do when you leave
service.

01:00:43.309 --> 01:00:45.309
But you've got to have dreams.

01:00:46.189 --> 01:00:48.228
Don't you have any dreams?

01:00:48.229 --> 01:00:50.268
Of course I do.

01:00:50.269 --> 01:00:52.269
Big dreams.

01:00:53.949 --> 01:00:56.669
It's just that I know now
they won't be coming true.

01:01:09.309 --> 01:01:12.029
What do you want?
I think I left my book in here.

01:01:18.909 --> 01:01:21.508
Is that all?
You were praying.

01:01:21.509 --> 01:01:23.548
Don't be ridiculous.

01:01:23.549 --> 01:01:25.588
You were praying.

01:01:25.589 --> 01:01:28.349
What were you praying for?
Please go. I'm tired.

01:01:49.989 --> 01:01:52.028
Dear Lord,

01:01:52.029 --> 01:01:54.909
I don't pretend to have much credit
with you.

01:01:56.229 --> 01:01:58.229
I'm not even sure that you're there.

01:01:59.989 --> 01:02:02.028
But if you are,

01:02:02.029 --> 01:02:05.468
and if I've ever done anything good,

01:02:05.469 --> 01:02:08.029
I beg you to keep him safe.

01:02:34.029 --> 01:02:36.469
You look very comfortable there,
Corporal.

01:02:39.829 --> 01:02:41.868
Would you like some, sir?

01:02:41.869 --> 01:02:43.869
We've got condensed milk and sugar.

01:02:44.669 --> 01:02:46.669
I won't ask how you managed that.

01:02:50.469 --> 01:02:52.469
Go on, sir.

01:02:55.869 --> 01:02:57.908
Oh, that's nectar.

01:02:57.909 --> 01:02:59.948
Are you sure you can spare it?

01:02:59.949 --> 01:03:02.588
Gladly, if we can talk about
the old days

01:03:02.589 --> 01:03:05.189
and forget about all of this
for a minute or two.

01:03:08.029 --> 01:03:09.949
Do you ever hear from anyone?
Oh, yes.

01:03:09.950 --> 01:03:11.988
Miss O'Brien keeps me informed.

01:03:11.989 --> 01:03:14.028
Lady Edith's driving.

01:03:14.029 --> 01:03:16.269
Lady Sybil's training as a nurse.

01:03:19.229 --> 01:03:22.148
Miss O'Brien tells me the hospital's
busier than ever,

01:03:22.149 --> 01:03:24.188
with the wounded coming in.

01:03:24.189 --> 01:03:26.228
Is that true?
Certainly is.

01:03:26.229 --> 01:03:29.349
They had a concert when I was there
to raise extra funds.

01:03:32.389 --> 01:03:34.428
I'm curious, sir.

01:03:34.429 --> 01:03:37.988
Do you think I could ever get a
transfer back to the hospital?

01:03:37.989 --> 01:03:39.989
Seeing as it's war work.

01:03:40.789 --> 01:03:43.429
Well, you'd have to be sent home
from the front, first.

01:03:44.509 --> 01:03:46.909
And then you might have to
pull a few strings.

01:03:51.229 --> 01:03:53.268
Thank you for that.

01:03:53.269 --> 01:03:55.269
Thank you very much.

01:03:55.709 --> 01:03:57.748
What would my mother say?

01:03:57.749 --> 01:04:00.949
Me entertaining the future
Earl of Grantham to tea.

01:04:02.869 --> 01:04:06.308
War has a way of distinguishing
between the things that matter

01:04:06.309 --> 01:04:08.309
and the things that don't.

01:05:12.349 --> 01:05:14.349
(GUNSHOT)

01:05:23.629 --> 01:05:25.668
Thank you.

01:05:25.669 --> 01:05:27.669
Thank you for my deliverance.

01:05:33.389 --> 01:05:35.068
Do you know Sir Richard Carlisle?

01:05:35.069 --> 01:05:38.148
Her uncle and I are old friends.
Well, old acquaintances, anyway.

01:05:38.149 --> 01:05:41.708
How dare you threaten me.
Oh, I assure you, I dare
a great deal more than that!

01:05:41.709 --> 01:05:43.589
If you still love him, let him
know.

01:05:43.590 --> 01:05:46.748
If you don't tell him, you could
regret it all your life long.

01:05:46.749 --> 01:05:48.988
You're like a real soldier!
I am a real soldier.

01:05:48.989 --> 01:05:51.149
Thank you very much.
Now come and give me a kiss.

01:05:53.229 --> 01:05:55.229
You see, I want you to marry me.

01:05:55.629 --> 01:05:57.788
(GROANS)
Carson!

01:05:57.789 --> 01:06:00.469
You'll find there's never a dull
moment in this house.
