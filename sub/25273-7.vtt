Previously on "Claws"...

00:06.408 --> 00:08.208
I swear, I didn't do anything wrong.

00:08.243 --> 00:10.911
Overprescribing
and conspiracy to traffic drugs.

00:10.946 --> 00:12.112
I heard a rumor.

00:12.147 --> 00:13.413
The Dixie Mafia...

00:13.449 --> 00:14.948
...they're coming after you next week.

00:14.984 --> 00:18.173
You want me to talk to them
while I wear a wire?

00:18.208 --> 00:20.040
I'm a criminal.
And I am really good at it.

00:20.075 --> 00:21.755
Shh, shh, shh! Shut up, Polly. Please.

00:21.790 --> 00:23.724
...doing is against the law.
I am a madam.

00:23.759 --> 00:24.954
What do you want to talk about?

00:28.063 --> 00:30.797
Pol, you okay with, uh, him staying here,

00:30.833 --> 00:32.799
till we get this shit figured out?

00:33.836 --> 00:35.669
Marry me, Desna.

00:35.704 --> 00:36.837
Put it on me!

00:36.872 --> 00:37.971
They killed my Juanda.

00:38.007 --> 00:39.373
That bitch deserves to die,

00:39.408 --> 00:41.008
and it's sure as shit
gonna to be me the one

00:41.043 --> 00:42.809
gonna snuff her out.

00:46.915 --> 00:50.283
Des! Is he gonna be okay?

00:50.319 --> 00:52.152
Babe? Nurse?!

00:52.187 --> 00:55.055
- She really thinks you love her?
- It's pathetic.

00:55.090 --> 00:58.325
Yeah, just like that.

01:39.968 --> 01:41.234
Marry me, Desna.

01:41.270 --> 01:43.103
Yes!

01:44.773 --> 01:48.275
Desna is powerful. Like chief of staff.

01:48.310 --> 01:51.378
Dessie?

01:51.413 --> 01:53.513
Dessie?

01:53.549 --> 01:55.048
Dessie.

01:55.084 --> 01:57.084
W-What are you doing out here, Des?

01:59.188 --> 02:00.854
Des?

02:00.889 --> 02:03.123
You feel... You feel really cold.

02:03.158 --> 02:06.109
D... W-Why... Why aren't
you talking to me?

02:07.229 --> 02:09.729
O-Okay, De... De...
You're being really weird.

02:09.764 --> 02:11.465
I'm go... I'm gonna call Virginia.

02:11.500 --> 02:13.033
Virgi... Virginia!

02:13.068 --> 02:14.901
- V-Virginia!
- What?

02:14.937 --> 02:17.671
Desna, uh, she's doing
something really weird.

02:17.706 --> 02:20.373
- Des, what's wrong?
- See? She won't talk.

02:21.730 --> 02:25.212
Des?! Hello?! Say something.

02:27.089 --> 02:29.091
You been out here all night?

02:30.563 --> 02:31.910
You're really freaking Dean out,

02:31.945 --> 02:34.354
- and now you're freaking me out, too.
- Yeah.

02:35.524 --> 02:37.491
What?

02:37.526 --> 02:38.992
Dean, it look like she might have burned

02:39.027 --> 02:41.128
- some drapes or something.
- Hmm?

02:41.163 --> 02:43.163
I don't know what that is.

02:43.689 --> 02:45.665
Wedding dress.

02:45.701 --> 02:47.467
- W-Wedding dress?
- Wedding dress?

02:48.504 --> 02:49.936
What?

02:54.616 --> 02:56.376
I'm fine.

02:56.411 --> 02:58.845
No, you're not.
Y-You almost burned your w...

02:58.881 --> 03:01.848
Dean, not right now.

03:01.884 --> 03:03.583
You, go get dressed.

03:03.619 --> 03:06.319
- Where we going?
- I'll tell you on the way.

03:17.799 --> 03:19.533
You left before I got back.

03:19.568 --> 03:21.101
I had to get to the store.

03:21.136 --> 03:23.603
If I'm not at the door
by the time Billie gets there,

03:23.639 --> 03:25.981
he docks my pay.

03:27.142 --> 03:28.608
You catch some waves?

03:28.644 --> 03:29.910
Mm-hmm.

03:29.945 --> 03:31.711
I got to clear my head.

03:32.821 --> 03:34.181
So, listen.

03:37.117 --> 03:40.520
I know it's a little soon,
but, um, I was wondering

03:40.556 --> 03:44.858
if you would be down to put our names

03:44.893 --> 03:47.694
back on the foster care list.

03:48.378 --> 03:50.897
I, uh...

03:50.933 --> 03:52.532
Wow.

03:54.536 --> 03:56.136
You know what?

03:57.005 --> 04:00.707
It's totally cool if you're
not down for it, you know.

04:00.742 --> 04:02.042
Um...

04:02.077 --> 04:03.510
I totally get it.

04:04.186 --> 04:06.346
I want a kid, don't get me wrong.

04:06.381 --> 04:10.483
It's just, I want to give us a beat.

04:10.519 --> 04:12.235
Work on us first.

04:13.188 --> 04:16.356
But in September, if we're
still at it, then I'm game.

04:16.391 --> 04:19.559
Oh, we'll be at it. Don't you worry.

04:21.596 --> 04:23.129
Oh, shit. My manager's coming.

04:23.165 --> 04:24.831
Let me get you back.

04:24.866 --> 04:26.166
Okay.

04:28.070 --> 04:29.970
Still sleeping with the enemy, huh?

04:30.005 --> 04:31.304
It's gonna get messy.

04:31.340 --> 04:33.873
Jesus, Waze doesn't
even work in this area!

04:33.909 --> 04:35.408
It's about time.

04:35.444 --> 04:37.644
Ken, we got enough to lock up Polly

04:37.679 --> 04:39.512
till she's old and crusty. thanks to you.

04:39.548 --> 04:41.815
Please. Please, just not Polly.

04:41.850 --> 04:44.217
Can you just give me just...
just a little bit more time?

04:44.253 --> 04:46.119
Lucky for you, we don't even want Polly.

04:46.154 --> 04:48.521
- Phew.
- We want the Russians.

04:48.557 --> 04:49.990
We know that Zlata Ostrovsky

04:50.025 --> 04:51.791
was involved in
the Hammer and Pickle shooting.

04:51.827 --> 04:54.160
You help us take her down,
your girl walks.

04:54.196 --> 04:56.162
No, please. Not Zlata, all right?

04:56.198 --> 04:58.431
Do you have any idea
how lethal that woman is?

04:58.467 --> 05:00.667
I heard that she murdered
a family of five

05:00.702 --> 05:03.136
and turned them into
life-sized nesting dolls.

05:03.171 --> 05:04.971
We don't care. Please.

05:05.007 --> 05:06.139
Get us a big fish.

05:06.174 --> 05:08.141
Otherwise, all we've got is Polly.

05:08.176 --> 05:09.542
Time's tickin'.

05:19.021 --> 05:20.353
Ruval and Zlata?!

05:20.389 --> 05:22.389
This whole time, they've been together?!

05:22.424 --> 05:25.258
What kind of messed-up shit is that?

05:25.294 --> 05:27.193
Not just that.

05:27.229 --> 05:29.062
They're plannin' something.

05:29.097 --> 05:30.330
What?

05:30.365 --> 05:32.098
What you mean, "planning"?

05:32.134 --> 05:34.200
Something against you?

05:34.236 --> 05:36.169
I don't know yet.

05:38.006 --> 05:39.572
I am so sorry, Des.

05:39.608 --> 05:42.275
You don't deserve this, girl.

05:42.311 --> 05:45.245
Now, listen.
I-I know exactly how you feel.

05:45.280 --> 05:47.347
I had this sugar daddy this one time,

05:47.382 --> 05:48.682
out in Hollywood Beach.

05:48.717 --> 05:50.984
Girl, he was perfect on the outside.

05:51.019 --> 05:52.352
He was a veterinarian.

05:52.387 --> 05:54.120
He used to collect these
cute little antique guns.

05:54.156 --> 05:55.722
- He was hot.
- Virginia!

05:55.757 --> 05:57.174
Uh...

05:59.661 --> 06:01.394
Uh, you might want to slow down, girl.

06:01.430 --> 06:03.963
'Cause I ain't
tryin' to die in this outfit.

06:03.999 --> 06:05.165
- Tryin' to stay aliv...
- Shh!

06:05.724 --> 06:07.033
Let me think!

06:07.069 --> 06:08.368
Damn!

06:19.322 --> 06:20.780
Privet.

06:20.816 --> 06:22.082
Hello.

06:22.117 --> 06:23.483
Oh, look at the doggy!

06:23.518 --> 06:25.185
Oh, God. Oh, God.

06:25.220 --> 06:26.886
Oh, God. Okay. Okay.

06:26.922 --> 06:29.122
Come on. Okay.

06:30.826 --> 06:32.292
Jesus.

06:32.327 --> 06:33.860
Testing, testing. I'm at the house.

06:33.895 --> 06:35.462
Please stand by.

06:41.151 --> 06:42.736
I'm here to see Zlata.

06:43.220 --> 06:45.605
Ugh. Let him in.

06:47.142 --> 06:48.608
Hey, Zlata.

06:48.643 --> 06:51.244
Uh, it's, uh, Dr. Ken from the clinic.

06:51.756 --> 06:53.089
I know who you are.

06:53.124 --> 06:55.101
- The nervous Jew.
- Yeah, t-that's me.

06:55.136 --> 06:56.426
I'm half Lebanese.

06:56.461 --> 06:58.494
You know, I wanted to talk.
You know, about my aspirations.

06:58.530 --> 06:59.782
I don't just want

06:59.807 --> 07:01.197
- to write scripts anymore.
- No.

07:01.233 --> 07:04.734
I-I think I'm more valuable
than my DEA number.

07:04.769 --> 07:08.370
No need to bullshit, my friend.

07:11.516 --> 07:13.291
You want more money.

07:15.580 --> 07:17.013
I respect that.

07:17.048 --> 07:19.082
It's good you don't steal.
You come to me.

07:19.117 --> 07:21.584
You steal, you know what happen.

07:21.620 --> 07:23.820
I give you second bris.

07:26.324 --> 07:28.073
I won't.

07:28.108 --> 07:30.093
I need all the penis I have.

07:30.128 --> 07:31.628
Follow me.

07:38.336 --> 07:41.738
Uhhh, this is not what I had in mind.

07:41.773 --> 07:43.506
If you can't handle, go back to clinic.

07:43.541 --> 07:44.674
You're gonna kill him.

07:46.177 --> 07:49.078
Is your job to keep him alive

07:49.114 --> 07:51.648
until we get information.

07:51.683 --> 07:53.249
Okay, up.

07:55.186 --> 07:56.920
Roller?

07:56.955 --> 07:58.321
I told you... I don't know where...

07:58.356 --> 08:00.390
where Uncle Daddy or Chip is.

08:00.425 --> 08:03.226
I don't know anything.

08:03.261 --> 08:05.728
Perhaps a little more vodka
will refresh your memory.

08:08.269 --> 08:10.102
How we feeling now?

08:10.103 --> 08:11.869
So clean? So fresh?

08:11.905 --> 08:15.373
Last chance to tell what you know.

08:15.408 --> 08:17.041
Up, up, up, up.

08:21.281 --> 08:22.647
Last time I saw Uncle Daddy,

08:22.682 --> 08:24.482
he was gettin' into it with Desna.

08:24.517 --> 08:27.351
He was smurfing into
the wrong account at Wabash.

08:27.387 --> 08:29.420
She didn't want the Feds snooping around.

08:29.455 --> 08:31.522
Why are we talking about Desna?

08:31.558 --> 08:34.039
I asked about Uncle Fatty.

08:36.763 --> 08:38.828
You, wake him up.

08:38.865 --> 08:40.370
What? Me?

08:40.405 --> 08:42.900
I-If you keep doing this,
he's... he's gonna die.

08:42.936 --> 08:44.635
Don't be such pussy.

08:44.671 --> 08:47.004
In Russia, this baby baptism.

08:47.040 --> 08:49.340
Roller. Roller.

08:49.375 --> 08:51.409
Ah, stop the love taps. Wha...

08:51.444 --> 08:52.677
Bring smell.

08:53.683 --> 08:56.080
You ever use stink to wake someone?

08:56.115 --> 08:58.115
Watch. It works.

08:58.151 --> 09:00.451
Yes! Finally.

09:00.486 --> 09:02.820
Now we try different tactic.

09:02.855 --> 09:04.221
Bring them in.

09:06.893 --> 09:08.693
Mm.

09:08.728 --> 09:10.928
Oh, come on.

09:10.964 --> 09:12.396
Ooh-ooh!

09:14.067 --> 09:16.067
Come on!

09:19.072 --> 09:20.404
That's it.

09:20.440 --> 09:23.074
Doing good, baby. You're doing it.

09:23.109 --> 09:24.909
Also, your booty's finally
gettin' a little bit more meat

09:24.944 --> 09:26.711
back on it, like I like.

09:26.746 --> 09:29.847
All right. Come on, now.

09:33.386 --> 09:34.619
Oh.

09:35.850 --> 09:37.555
This is bullshit.

09:37.590 --> 09:39.390
So's your attitude.

09:39.425 --> 09:41.125
You tell that to all the cripples?

09:41.160 --> 09:44.829
You're not gonna get your motor
function back all overnight.

09:44.864 --> 09:46.330
I'm gonna go motivate another client,

09:46.366 --> 09:47.665
and then we'll get back to work.

09:47.700 --> 09:50.635
Yeah, you motivate
another client. Whatever.

09:50.670 --> 09:54.705
Listen, you got a tough-love
vibe, and I dig it.

09:56.643 --> 09:58.142
All right, babe.

10:00.146 --> 10:02.446
You gonna come here to me
and tell me what's wrong?

10:02.482 --> 10:03.814
I mean, you know, besides the fact

10:03.850 --> 10:05.583
that you gotta learn how to walk again.

10:07.687 --> 10:10.988
Just... I'm nervous about the operation.

10:11.024 --> 10:12.456
There's nothing to be nervous about,

10:12.492 --> 10:13.891
'cause all they're gonna do is take

10:13.926 --> 10:15.926
that nasty little bullet
fragment out of your lung.

10:15.962 --> 10:17.996
- Then you're gonna be good as new.
- Mm-hmm.

10:18.031 --> 10:19.830
Okay? They got you this far.

10:19.866 --> 10:21.098
Yeah?

10:21.134 --> 10:22.400
It was mostly you.

10:22.435 --> 10:24.568
Come on.

10:24.604 --> 10:26.192
Om, om, nom, nom.

10:26.906 --> 10:28.873
Ooh, I hate her for what she did to you.

10:28.908 --> 10:31.842
You know what? Hey, everything's
gonna be all right, baby,

10:31.878 --> 10:33.711
all right? Like, I'm gonna be fine.

10:33.746 --> 10:36.380
Uh-huh. How about I take
that long-ass fake ponytail

10:36.416 --> 10:38.883
and squeeze it around her neck
till her eyeballs pop out?

10:38.918 --> 10:41.285
It's not funny, Bryce. I mean it.

10:41.320 --> 10:43.120
Hey, forget about Zlata.

10:43.156 --> 10:44.188
How am I gonna forget?

10:44.223 --> 10:45.790
She shot you point-blank.

10:46.498 --> 10:48.292
- Look, it's...
- I'm never gonna forget it.

10:48.327 --> 10:50.127
It's not all her fault.

10:50.163 --> 10:51.629
Okay, none of this woulda happened

10:51.664 --> 10:53.664
if I never started workin'
for Uncle Daddy.

10:53.700 --> 10:56.167
- Bryce...
- Hey, it's true.

10:57.737 --> 10:59.670
I'm done with the life, Jenn.

11:00.143 --> 11:01.439
Well...

11:01.474 --> 11:03.841
Hey, I'm mean it this time.

11:03.876 --> 11:05.843
I'm done with Palmetto.

11:05.878 --> 11:09.113
Hey, what do you say we take
whatever we got saved up

11:09.148 --> 11:12.616
and... and move to Tampa, Miami.

11:12.652 --> 11:14.652
Hell, we can even get out of Florida.

11:14.687 --> 11:17.488
There's nothing holding us here. Nothing.

11:18.745 --> 11:20.691
Ohh.

11:20.727 --> 11:22.526
I love you so much.

11:22.562 --> 11:24.061
I love you.

11:24.097 --> 11:25.196
Come here.

11:30.436 --> 11:34.538
Ooh! So little, so fragile.

11:34.574 --> 11:37.408
So easy to break.

11:37.443 --> 11:38.476
Zlata, please.

11:38.511 --> 11:39.777
- Mama, Mama.
- Shh, shh.

11:39.812 --> 11:41.145
- No, no, no, no, no, no.
- Shh, shh, shh.

11:41.180 --> 11:42.213
Please!

11:42.248 --> 11:43.414
Is not up to me.

11:43.449 --> 11:46.283
- Is up to Roller.
- Oh, no. Oh, no.

11:46.319 --> 11:47.585
Where's Uncle Daddy?

11:47.620 --> 11:49.754
Please don't hurt the baby,
Zlata. Please.

11:49.789 --> 11:52.590
You're right. Hurt is too much effort.

11:55.027 --> 11:56.727
- Please, please, please, please.
- No, no, no, no.

11:56.763 --> 11:58.262
Please! I don't know any...

11:58.297 --> 12:01.465
I don't know anything, Zlata!
I promise you!

12:01.501 --> 12:02.900
No, no, no, no.

12:02.935 --> 12:04.201
Get out of my way.

12:04.237 --> 12:05.536
Don't.

12:09.342 --> 12:11.047
Don't.

12:12.445 --> 12:14.812
All right. I'll tell you the truth.

12:14.847 --> 12:17.014
Uncle Daddy killed Chip.

12:17.049 --> 12:20.284
I tried to stop him,
but he don't listen to shit.

12:20.319 --> 12:22.475
I put him on a Greyhound.

12:23.389 --> 12:24.755
Where to?

12:24.791 --> 12:26.857
Greensborough.

12:28.728 --> 12:30.361
I don't where he is now, Zlata,
I promise.

12:30.396 --> 12:33.297
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

12:33.332 --> 12:35.466
- Shh, shh.
- You owe me cop.

12:38.271 --> 12:40.070
Untie my husband.

12:45.211 --> 12:46.644
Get out.

12:52.046 --> 12:54.218
That crazy bitch was gonna kill our kid.

12:54.253 --> 12:56.187
I know.

12:56.222 --> 12:57.688
But you saved him.

12:59.158 --> 13:01.125
'Course I did. I'm his daddy.

13:01.160 --> 13:02.932
Roller...

13:04.831 --> 13:07.231
you are good man.

13:09.020 --> 13:11.168
I didn't mean for this to happen.

13:11.204 --> 13:15.606
I mean, we should not have been married.

13:15.641 --> 13:17.374
Tell me something I don't know.

13:17.410 --> 13:19.944
Hey, baby.

13:20.325 --> 13:23.013
You don't know everything.

13:24.120 --> 13:26.650
Bogdan is not your son.

13:28.521 --> 13:29.687
I'm sorry.

13:29.722 --> 13:32.189
I didn't mean for this to happen.

13:32.225 --> 13:33.838
I just...

13:36.028 --> 13:37.962
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

13:37.997 --> 13:39.830
Come here. Come here. I'm sorry.

13:39.866 --> 13:41.365
Come here. I'm sorry.

13:42.635 --> 13:44.535
What's that?

13:44.570 --> 13:46.604
Get away from me.

13:46.639 --> 13:48.806
Okay.

14:03.055 --> 14:06.924
I just want to drag they
treacherous asses behind my car

14:06.959 --> 14:08.392
until they both dead.

14:08.427 --> 14:09.693
You're no killer, Des.

14:09.729 --> 14:11.161
Yeah. Just ask my baby boy.

14:11.197 --> 14:13.797
Shut up, Clay. This is different.

14:13.833 --> 14:15.633
I want revenge.

14:15.668 --> 14:17.034
And I want it bad.

14:17.069 --> 14:18.435
I know, but there's gotta be another way.

14:18.471 --> 14:20.738
You don't want two homicides
on your conscience.

14:20.773 --> 14:22.106
Don't tell me what I want.

14:22.141 --> 14:24.375
Listen, but you got
to think about Dean, okay?

14:25.598 --> 14:28.379
I want them to pay
for what they did to me.

14:29.949 --> 14:31.615
Virginia!

14:32.752 --> 14:36.887
Listen up. Ruval supplies most
of the coke for the state.

14:36.923 --> 14:39.123
That's where Zlata gets it from.

14:39.158 --> 14:40.524
That's it.

14:40.559 --> 14:42.393
We will destroy their supply,

14:42.428 --> 14:45.329
because that shit right there
will hurt both of 'em.

14:45.364 --> 14:47.264
Yeah. Now, he keeps
them drugs in a warehouse...

14:47.300 --> 14:49.400
...down by Cattleman Road.
I got eyes down there.

14:49.435 --> 14:50.935
Lemme make a phone call.

14:50.970 --> 14:52.970
That crazy bitch Zlata

14:53.005 --> 14:55.873
taught me how to make
a mean Molotov cocktail.

14:55.908 --> 14:57.474
Girl, you tryin' to burn their shit down?

14:57.510 --> 15:00.210
I'm tryin' to burn it down
to the damn ground.

15:00.246 --> 15:01.879
Uh, when?

15:01.914 --> 15:03.580
Today! Now! I don't know!

15:03.616 --> 15:05.649
Yeah, all right,
all right. Calm down now, Desna.

15:05.685 --> 15:08.585
Apparently there's some sort
of Caribbean Cup soccer thing

15:08.621 --> 15:09.853
going on tomorrow.

15:09.889 --> 15:11.155
Which means that Ruval and his boys

15:11.190 --> 15:12.556
gonna be gettin' shit-hammered

15:12.591 --> 15:14.925
at some Haitian hangout,
which means there's gonna be

15:14.961 --> 15:17.227
a skeleton crew
at the warehouse tomorrow.

15:17.263 --> 15:18.829
- Done.
- I'm in.

15:18.864 --> 15:20.197
Baby, I just, like...

15:20.232 --> 15:22.032
I can't home to my babies
smelling like arson.

15:22.068 --> 15:25.469
Don't. You and Pol go to the salon,

15:25.504 --> 15:27.471
keep everything runnin' like normal.

15:27.506 --> 15:28.906
Y'all two comin' with me.

15:28.941 --> 15:30.941
- But I love the smell of arson.
- Oh.

15:30.977 --> 15:32.409
Des, wait. Let's just think this through.

15:32.445 --> 15:35.079
No, I'm done thinking about it.

15:35.114 --> 15:37.281
I'm not gonna be played the fool no more.

15:37.316 --> 15:39.516
This shit is happening tomorrow.

15:39.552 --> 15:40.851
Right on.

15:41.587 --> 15:42.987
Let's go.

15:46.929 --> 15:48.158
Tomorrow?!

16:04.094 --> 16:07.328
Told y'all, it's a ghost town up in here.

16:08.451 --> 16:11.466
Like taking nose candy from a baby.

16:11.501 --> 16:13.601
Des, it's not too late to back out.

16:13.637 --> 16:16.204
We can still go to my friend
who practices Santeria,

16:16.239 --> 16:17.805
go at it from a different angle.

16:17.841 --> 16:19.073
No.

16:19.109 --> 16:20.875
That takes too long.

16:20.911 --> 16:23.411
I don't like this.

16:28.585 --> 16:30.285
Crank it.

16:35.926 --> 16:37.325
- Hurry up.
- Go, go, go.

16:40.096 --> 16:41.396
You look tore up.

16:41.431 --> 16:43.164
You sure you don't want
to sit this one out?

16:43.199 --> 16:44.632
It's a Monday for me, baby.

16:44.668 --> 16:45.867
- Come on.
- Mm.

16:45.902 --> 16:47.502
All right, where the...

16:47.537 --> 16:48.870
What the hell, Virginia?

16:48.905 --> 16:50.505
What kind of amateur bullshit is this?

16:50.540 --> 16:53.841
Excuse all y'all. The masks
are a fashion statement.

16:53.877 --> 16:55.510
- Come on, now.
- Oh, shit.

16:55.545 --> 16:57.578
- Let's do this.
- All right, follow me.

16:57.614 --> 16:59.847
Eeee

17:21.204 --> 17:23.137
All right, y'all go
in the door in the back.

17:23.173 --> 17:24.439
Roller, you come with me.

17:24.473 --> 17:27.842
- Come on, now.
- Hey, hey.

17:27.877 --> 17:30.044
Hey.

17:30.080 --> 17:32.246
What? What's up?

17:35.752 --> 17:37.852
Let's go.

17:37.887 --> 17:39.520
Let's roll.

17:40.757 --> 17:43.391
It was the third year,
and that over-tanned heifer

17:43.426 --> 17:44.993
thought she was gonna beat me again.

17:45.028 --> 17:46.194
- No, ma'am.
- Huh!

17:46.229 --> 17:47.628
So I took care of it.

17:47.664 --> 17:50.798
Ooh! You did something naughty.
I can see it.

17:50.834 --> 17:53.167
I sent her a little care package

17:53.203 --> 17:55.503
- A possum in a box.
- What?!

17:55.538 --> 17:58.006
And when she opened it,
it bit up her lips.

17:58.041 --> 17:59.574
- No!
- Seriously, girl.

17:59.609 --> 18:02.076
It bit her lip completely off.

18:02.112 --> 18:05.079
So guess who won the
bikini contest this year!

18:05.115 --> 18:08.182
Ey! Ey! Ey! Ey!

18:08.218 --> 18:10.618
- All right, dry it up, mama.
- Okay.

18:10.653 --> 18:13.621
Salon is closed now. Private party.

18:13.656 --> 18:15.123
Since when?

18:15.158 --> 18:17.058
Mm, since now.

18:17.093 --> 18:18.760
But my nails aren't dry.

18:18.795 --> 18:20.428
Blow hard, tiny girl.

18:20.463 --> 18:24.365
We're called little people, asshole.

18:24.401 --> 18:27.368
- Where's Desna?
- Uh, wedding-dress shopping.

18:27.404 --> 18:29.103
She had one, but it's not...

18:29.139 --> 18:30.471
It's not gonna work, so she had to...

18:30.507 --> 18:31.757
No, 'cause it was too sexy.

18:31.792 --> 18:34.275
She decided she needed
to cover up the twins.

18:34.310 --> 18:36.077
- That's a big job.
- Yeah.

18:36.112 --> 18:39.147
Today, I close salon
for treat for associates.

18:39.182 --> 18:41.716
Ladies, sit, sit, sit.

18:41.751 --> 18:46.320
Despite arthritis, they do
very good job cutting coke.

18:46.356 --> 18:49.724
So, is this going to be problem for you?

18:49.759 --> 18:52.727
No. I love people
who paralyze my husband.

18:52.762 --> 18:54.283
Mm. Good.

18:56.733 --> 18:58.566
You do me.

19:05.975 --> 19:07.842
Des, Des.

19:07.877 --> 19:10.545
What if Uncle Daddy's wrong, and
they're not watching the game?

19:10.580 --> 19:12.046
Shit, we in it now.

19:12.082 --> 19:13.748
Come on.

19:18.188 --> 19:19.754
Allez, allez!

19:19.789 --> 19:21.889
Shit! Go! Go, go, go!

19:23.927 --> 19:25.693
Damn.

19:27.163 --> 19:28.696
He didn't see us.

19:28.731 --> 19:30.131
There's the door.

19:32.168 --> 19:35.937
Stick to the plan... in and out.

19:35.972 --> 19:37.405
Hurry up.

19:46.349 --> 19:49.784
Must be hard for girls
with papa in hospital.

19:51.727 --> 19:53.160
They'll survive.

19:55.925 --> 19:57.525
Chin up.

19:57.560 --> 19:59.293
He won't have to shit in bag.

19:59.329 --> 20:01.529
He will be out soon back at work.

20:04.774 --> 20:06.341
We'll see.

20:06.366 --> 20:07.915
Ow!

20:08.872 --> 20:09.975
Jennifer.

20:11.040 --> 20:13.441
Don't like this this rough.

20:13.863 --> 20:16.811
Um, hey, y'all know what's missing here?

20:16.846 --> 20:18.279
Drinks.

20:18.314 --> 20:20.948
Jenn, why don't you get that
champers out of the fridge?

20:20.984 --> 20:24.018
And, um, I'm gonna put on some
upbeat music for these ladies.

20:24.053 --> 20:26.087
Ooh, that would be lovely.

20:32.262 --> 20:33.394
- Hey, gimme that.
- Polly!

20:33.429 --> 20:34.695
- Give it, give it.
- Polly.

20:34.731 --> 20:37.365
Did you know
that Russians nerve gas people

20:37.400 --> 20:39.467
- without them even knowing it?
- Polly, don't.

20:39.502 --> 20:42.069
You don't see it, you don't smell it.

20:42.105 --> 20:43.538
I've been binge-watching "Homeland."

20:43.573 --> 20:45.473
I want to kill that bitch, okay?

20:45.508 --> 20:47.008
Bryce has to have
another surgery tomorrow,

20:47.043 --> 20:49.210
and she's gonna waltz up
in here and get her nails done

20:49.245 --> 20:50.411
like some Commie Kardashian?

20:50.446 --> 20:51.746
I hear you loud and clear, girl,

20:51.781 --> 20:53.848
but you've got to compartmentalize.

20:53.883 --> 20:54.949
Just separate.

20:54.984 --> 20:56.717
Bryce could die, okay?

20:56.753 --> 20:58.419
How am I supposed to
compartmentalize that?

20:58.454 --> 20:59.954
You don't have any choice. That's how.

20:59.989 --> 21:02.490
Now take two deep breaths,
say the Lord's Prayer,

21:02.525 --> 21:05.259
and get back out there
and do some acrylic ombres.

21:07.797 --> 21:09.664
Good girl.

21:26.316 --> 21:28.983
Okay, come on. We got to hurry up.

21:29.018 --> 21:31.419
Look at all that shit.

21:31.454 --> 21:33.788
Oh, my God.

21:33.823 --> 21:35.690
Look, Virginia. Look at this.

21:35.725 --> 21:37.725
This Creole-talking witch doctor

21:37.760 --> 21:40.073
got a picture of his
damn mama on his desk.

21:40.108 --> 21:41.529
Think his mama know he got a crew?

21:41.564 --> 21:43.297
For all you know, she runs this shit.

21:43.333 --> 21:45.733
Douse that shit, Virginia.

21:47.203 --> 21:48.603
What was that?

21:48.638 --> 21:50.104
Oh, shit.

21:53.576 --> 21:56.043
I got it. I got this.

22:08.625 --> 22:10.324
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

22:10.360 --> 22:11.959
Oh, shit.

22:13.930 --> 22:15.229
Clay, you idiot.

22:15.265 --> 22:17.398
I almost blew your damn head off.

22:17.433 --> 22:19.200
Good shot, too.
I didn't know you had it in ya.

22:19.235 --> 22:20.568
What happened out there?

22:20.603 --> 22:22.203
Oh, they... they shot,
and we got 'em back,

22:22.238 --> 22:24.272
but all this noise is gonna
bring in the cavalry, so...

22:24.307 --> 22:25.606
Shit. Okay.

22:25.642 --> 22:27.708
Everybody douse everything.
Let's do this.

22:27.744 --> 22:29.644
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Change of plans.

22:32.157 --> 22:33.381
We're taking the coke.

22:33.416 --> 22:34.615
Wait. What?

22:34.651 --> 22:35.916
The plan is to burn it.

22:35.952 --> 22:37.485
Yeah, well, I'm from the South.

22:37.520 --> 22:39.787
We burn crosses and matches
after we take a shit.

22:39.822 --> 22:41.155
Let's get this stuff on the boat.

22:41.190 --> 22:42.290
- Come on, now.
- What?

22:42.325 --> 22:43.758
- Roller, don't.
- He's right.

22:43.793 --> 22:45.426
Burning's bad business, baby.

22:45.461 --> 22:47.828
No! No, we're not doing this!

22:47.864 --> 22:49.297
Des, no!

22:49.332 --> 22:51.365
Clay, I promised my girls

22:51.401 --> 22:52.933
that we would not be in the coke game.

22:52.969 --> 22:56.070
Leaving this place empty-handed
is not the best revenge.

22:56.105 --> 22:59.874
Now, they ruined your life.
Tried to ruin all of our lives.

22:59.909 --> 23:05.279
If we wanna take these people
down, we need some leverage.

23:11.988 --> 23:13.821
Shit.

23:13.856 --> 23:15.089
He's right.

23:15.124 --> 23:16.724
- Pack it up!
- No!

23:16.759 --> 23:18.793
Des, what are you thinking?!

23:18.828 --> 23:20.428
- Are you even thinking?
- No!

23:20.463 --> 23:22.830
You are not in charge, Ann! I am!

23:22.865 --> 23:24.428
Shut up and pack it!

23:25.368 --> 23:27.601
Come on, now. Let's go.

23:27.637 --> 23:29.503
Get down, D!

23:32.308 --> 23:33.808
- Oh, my God.
- Bang, bang, baby.

23:33.843 --> 23:35.876
- Let's go.
- Ann, here, here, here!

23:35.912 --> 23:38.446
- Come on, come on, come on.
- Get my gun, Virginia!

23:38.481 --> 23:40.014
Okay, got it.

23:46.989 --> 23:49.056
Stay down, stay down, stay down.

23:49.092 --> 23:50.891
Get down.

23:50.927 --> 23:52.093
Shit. Get low!

23:54.630 --> 23:56.097
Go, go, go, go!

24:00.136 --> 24:01.969
Aah!

24:25.389 --> 24:26.722
Yay!

24:33.364 --> 24:35.264
Goal!

24:45.009 --> 24:46.642
Hello? Palé: We need to talk.

24:46.677 --> 24:49.611
Palé. The product is gone.

24:49.647 --> 24:51.313
What are you talking about?

24:51.348 --> 24:54.450
Men broke in, killed our
people, and took the product.

24:54.485 --> 24:55.684
Who was it?

24:55.719 --> 24:57.653
Clay's gonna want us to sell the coke.

24:57.688 --> 24:58.821
This is so insane.

24:58.856 --> 25:00.756
Unh-unh. We not dealing shit.

25:00.791 --> 25:03.325
Oh, hey, listen. I don't mind
bein' a corner boy, okay?

25:03.360 --> 25:05.694
Give me an eight ball,
I need a Gucci bag.

25:05.729 --> 25:07.096
- Shut up!
- Shut up!

25:11.602 --> 25:13.936
You know, last time I got hit, boy,

25:13.971 --> 25:16.705
I was doing a job with your daddy.

25:16.740 --> 25:19.374
Don't worry. We finna stitch you up soon.

25:19.410 --> 25:21.543
We tried to take down a 7-Eleven.

25:23.647 --> 25:25.881
That fool grabbed the Slurpee machine.

25:25.916 --> 25:28.217
- No shit.
- Yeah.

25:29.553 --> 25:30.819
You okay?

25:30.855 --> 25:33.088
- Yeah, I'm all right.
- Yep?

25:33.124 --> 25:36.425
Okay, Dr. Ken's gonna
stitch you up in no time.

25:36.460 --> 25:39.394
No, boy. We ain't got time for that.

25:39.430 --> 25:41.864
We got to secure that cocaine.

25:41.899 --> 25:44.433
Time for us to get outta the gulag.

25:44.468 --> 25:46.802
Turn that shit up and let's go.

25:53.544 --> 25:54.977
You want your cuticles trimmed?

25:55.012 --> 25:57.012
Don't you know by now, Jennifer?

25:57.047 --> 25:59.081
I want it all.

25:59.583 --> 26:01.150
Ow!

26:01.627 --> 26:03.719
I sense resentment.

26:03.754 --> 26:05.254
Oh, that's so perceptive.

26:05.289 --> 26:09.458
I know your family has
bills to pay for hospital.

26:09.493 --> 26:11.360
Here. Take it.

26:11.395 --> 26:13.128
I don't want your blood money, Zlata.

26:13.164 --> 26:14.630
I'm being generous.

26:14.665 --> 26:16.465
Your husband tried kill me.

26:16.500 --> 26:18.369
Yeah, and then you shot him point-blank.

26:18.404 --> 26:21.470
Jenn, just think of it
as a big, big, big-ass tip.

26:21.505 --> 26:22.871
Why don't you stay out of it, Pol?

26:22.907 --> 26:26.208
I see. This is negotiating tactic.

26:26.243 --> 26:27.576
Maybe you're right.

26:27.611 --> 26:30.445
Maybe I was a little bit aggressive.

26:30.481 --> 26:31.947
Take it all.

26:31.982 --> 26:35.017
I want things to be good between us.

26:35.052 --> 26:37.786
Yeah, you know, if somebody's
trying to give you money,

26:37.821 --> 26:39.721
take it like a welfare queen.

26:42.760 --> 26:45.093
Thank you. This will be real helpful.

26:47.731 --> 26:50.465
Great. I'm glad I can help.

26:56.807 --> 26:58.840
Ah, 'tis the season, y'all.

26:58.876 --> 27:01.353
Power will be back up in a hot sec.

27:04.315 --> 27:06.982
Careful what you wish for, dear.

27:07.017 --> 27:08.684
Wouldn't want to be cavalier.

27:08.719 --> 27:11.687
By menthol cough and midriff top.

27:11.722 --> 27:13.655
By rebel flag and hookah shop.

27:13.691 --> 27:16.491
By gator egg and ancient Jew.

27:16.527 --> 27:18.660
By Spanish moss and sniffing glue.

27:20.197 --> 27:23.365
You guys should take this show
on the road. Right, Pol?

27:23.400 --> 27:25.100
Murder marks a lady's life.

27:25.135 --> 27:27.369
What she craves could bring her strife.

27:27.404 --> 27:29.538
Nah. Kill the bitch.

27:31.642 --> 27:33.175
- Kill the bitch.
- Kill the bitch.

27:33.210 --> 27:34.443
Kill the bitch.

27:34.478 --> 27:35.677
- Kill the bitch.
- Kill the bitch.

27:35.713 --> 27:37.713
- Kill the bitch.
- Kill the bitch.

27:37.748 --> 27:39.414
Kill the bitch.

27:41.552 --> 27:42.651
You kill me...

27:42.686 --> 27:44.453
You become me.

27:48.259 --> 27:49.625
Oh. See?

27:49.660 --> 27:52.060
I told y'all it'd end before it began.

27:53.113 --> 27:56.331
Oh! A little beauty catnap.

27:56.367 --> 27:57.733
Oh, excuse me.

27:57.768 --> 27:59.868
Da?

27:59.903 --> 28:01.470
We need to talk.

28:01.505 --> 28:02.738
Now.

28:05.542 --> 28:07.876
Is everything okay?

28:09.513 --> 28:12.447
You have any idea how much time
we can do for this shit?

28:12.483 --> 28:14.249
Nobody is going down for this.

28:14.285 --> 28:15.250
You don't know that!

28:15.286 --> 28:17.486
You just keep putting us all at risk.

28:17.521 --> 28:19.087
I made a smart move.

28:19.123 --> 28:22.162
Ruval is gonna think
a rival crew jacked his dope.

28:22.197 --> 28:23.618
- We good.
- You just keep getting us

28:23.643 --> 28:24.714
deeper and deeper

28:24.749 --> 28:26.628
- into your bullshit.
- God, can y'all stop fighting?

28:26.664 --> 28:28.764
What I'm tryin' to do is to get us all

28:28.799 --> 28:30.332
out from underneath this shit.

28:30.367 --> 28:33.735
How? By stealing coke
from the Haitian mafia

28:33.771 --> 28:35.437
and storing it in the salon?

28:35.472 --> 28:36.972
Exactly.

28:37.007 --> 28:40.676
'Cause this is my crew, and
if you in it, you do what I say.

28:40.711 --> 28:41.943
So stand down.

28:41.979 --> 28:43.845
- Your crew?
- Be easy.

28:43.881 --> 28:45.947
Be easy? You know what?

28:45.983 --> 28:49.151
It's too goddamn late for easy, Des.

28:49.186 --> 28:50.886
I'm out.

28:53.257 --> 28:55.090
Damn. What is wrong with her?

28:55.125 --> 28:56.368
Don't.

29:11.758 --> 29:13.519
Y'all are not gonna believe this shit.

29:13.554 --> 29:15.265
- What happened?
- Y'all,

29:15.301 --> 29:17.361
we just stole a buttload of coke.

29:17.397 --> 29:19.411
Wait. Wh... You... You were
supposed to burn that shit.

29:19.411 --> 29:21.244
Desna! Desna, what did y'all do?

29:21.279 --> 29:22.712
It's only gonna be in here tonight.

29:22.747 --> 29:24.013
Go put it in my office.

29:24.049 --> 29:26.249
- In the salon?
- It's been nice knowing you.

29:26.284 --> 29:27.951
I'm officially tapping out.

29:27.986 --> 29:29.686
Wait. Quiet Ann, let's talk about this.

29:29.721 --> 29:31.354
Desna, you said we weren't
gonna do this shit.

29:31.389 --> 29:33.423
It is temporary. Damn! Stop trippin'.

29:33.458 --> 29:35.024
Chill the hell out.
We just need a safe place

29:35.060 --> 29:36.359
to chop and bag the Tony.

29:36.394 --> 29:37.894
First thing in the morning, we're gone.

29:37.929 --> 29:39.128
Well, you ain't gonna cut it here.

29:39.164 --> 29:40.663
Do not let them cut it here.

29:40.699 --> 29:41.965
Hey, calm your tits, will ya?

29:42.000 --> 29:43.666
We ain't tryin' to turn you into runners.

29:43.702 --> 29:44.968
You can barely run a nail salon.

29:45.003 --> 29:46.202
Is that a bullet wound?

29:46.237 --> 29:48.104
Clay, let me take a look at that.

29:48.139 --> 29:50.273
- Yeah.
- I'm out.

29:50.308 --> 29:53.743
So, now you a choir boy,
Assault and Battery?

29:53.778 --> 29:55.878
Ya know, there's a part of you

29:55.914 --> 29:58.281
that just love the drama,
right, living on the edge.

29:58.316 --> 30:00.550
But I'm not wearing
an orange jumpsuit again.

30:00.585 --> 30:01.584
Not ever.

30:01.620 --> 30:03.419
None of y'all had to come back here, Ann.

30:03.455 --> 30:05.355
You coulda stayed your ass at Glint

30:05.390 --> 30:07.023
and been free from all of it.

30:07.058 --> 30:09.158
Call me when you wake up.

30:12.530 --> 30:13.997
Ann.

30:20.572 --> 30:21.838
All right.

30:21.873 --> 30:23.873
What's our next move, boo?

30:24.348 --> 30:26.976
Your next move is to go to the hospital

30:27.012 --> 30:28.177
and be with your man.

30:28.213 --> 30:30.046
- Are you sure? There is...
- I... Go.

30:30.081 --> 30:33.116
I got this. Come on. Go.

30:33.151 --> 30:34.751
I love you, babe.

30:34.786 --> 30:35.918
I'll be back, now.

30:37.722 --> 30:40.456
Shit.

30:42.360 --> 30:45.094
What is so important? I had
to leave nail salon naked.

30:45.130 --> 30:48.431
- Huh?
- 250 kilos are gone.

30:48.466 --> 30:51.501
A crew broke into
my warehouse, killed my men,

30:51.536 --> 30:53.803
and fled on a boat with the drugs.

30:53.838 --> 30:55.438
It better not be your men.

30:55.473 --> 30:57.507
Why would I steal from myself?

30:57.542 --> 31:00.343
We in this together, remember?

31:00.378 --> 31:02.011
Don't.

31:02.036 --> 31:04.681
They doused the place.

31:08.086 --> 31:09.952
D'ermo.

31:09.988 --> 31:12.388
Who? Who did this?

31:12.424 --> 31:15.558
Colombians? Aryan Brotherhood?

31:15.593 --> 31:17.393
Could be.

31:17.429 --> 31:18.628
Or Clay?

31:18.663 --> 31:20.763
We get to bottom of this.

31:20.799 --> 31:21.964
Mm.

31:28.239 --> 31:30.773
Okay, almost there.

31:30.809 --> 31:32.742
One, two, three.

31:35.836 --> 31:38.147
You could have told me
you were gonna change it up

31:38.183 --> 31:39.415
before game time.

31:39.451 --> 31:41.384
I lost one of my girls 'cause of you.

31:41.419 --> 31:43.586
Ann will come to her senses.

31:43.621 --> 31:48.558
Hope that damn Ruval is
somewhere twisting in the wind.

31:48.593 --> 31:50.760
We must have stole 2 mill from him.

31:50.795 --> 31:51.994
He's twistin'.

31:53.312 --> 31:56.265
I just cannot figure this shit out.

31:56.301 --> 31:58.377
- Aah!
- I mean, outta all the people

31:58.402 --> 31:59.736
in the world,

31:59.771 --> 32:01.337
why come after me?

32:01.372 --> 32:03.406
Yeah, she just a nail technician.

32:03.441 --> 32:06.209
Uh, a really good one, girl.

32:09.948 --> 32:11.788
What's the look, Clay?

32:12.748 --> 32:14.817
- Well, what?
- Well, what?

32:14.853 --> 32:18.421
I'm just drinkin' here,
enjoying y'all's company.

32:18.456 --> 32:19.889
Unh-unh.

32:19.924 --> 32:21.624
Do not play with me.

32:21.659 --> 32:23.526
I will go in that office right now,

32:23.561 --> 32:25.895
and I will light all that shit on fire.

32:26.303 --> 32:28.531
What, Clay?

32:32.871 --> 32:34.504
Because of your license.

32:36.007 --> 32:37.406
What license?

32:37.442 --> 32:39.142
License to run the clinic.

32:39.210 --> 32:40.409
What are you talking about?

32:40.445 --> 32:42.411
It's the reason we picked you.

32:42.447 --> 32:45.581
Besides having a cash business to smurf,

32:45.617 --> 32:48.351
- you had a clean record.
- I don't understand.

32:48.386 --> 32:51.521
When we decided to expand
the clinic operation,

32:51.556 --> 32:54.123
the Feds were cracking down
on passing out licenses.

32:54.159 --> 32:55.591
'Specially to people with records.

32:55.627 --> 32:58.294
So Roller here couldn't get
one 'cause of the... the bid

32:58.329 --> 33:00.329
he did down in Miami, dumb ass.

33:00.365 --> 33:03.232
Bryce, he's a crackhead,
so that's no good, right?

33:03.268 --> 33:04.700
What about Juanda and Jenn?

33:04.736 --> 33:08.371
Well, they have records longer
than all y'all in the salon.

33:08.406 --> 33:12.408
- Mm, true.
- But you's, girl...

33:12.849 --> 33:15.111
you, Desna, you's clean, girl.

33:15.146 --> 33:17.446
But, Clay, I didn't sign nothing.

33:17.482 --> 33:19.015
Well, you didn't know
you was signing somethin',

33:19.050 --> 33:20.216
but you signed somethin'.

33:20.251 --> 33:21.751
Now that your name's on the license,

33:21.786 --> 33:24.220
that means you're the only one
that can open up more clinics.

33:24.255 --> 33:25.588
That's how they opened
the new one with you.

33:25.623 --> 33:28.324
Ruval's a doctor.
He could have got a license.

33:28.359 --> 33:30.909
I told you... They weren't
giving any more out, man.

33:31.868 --> 33:34.664
But if Ruval marries you,

33:34.699 --> 33:37.533
then, um, he gets the license...

33:39.704 --> 33:41.337
...when you die.

33:43.174 --> 33:44.207
Ooh.

33:45.006 --> 33:47.310
He was gonna kill me?

33:48.713 --> 33:50.079
- Y...
- Hey.

33:50.114 --> 33:51.380
- You were gonna let him kill me?!
- Hey!

33:51.416 --> 33:52.748
Hey, D! I didn't know nothing about this!

33:52.784 --> 33:54.250
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
- C'mon, now, Des.

33:54.285 --> 33:55.685
Now, we'd never let it go that far.

33:55.720 --> 33:57.520
Y'all have been rollin'
over me since day one.

33:57.555 --> 33:59.055
I promise you. I didn't know anyth...

33:59.090 --> 34:00.923
- Shut up! I'm done with you.
- No, I didn't know this shit.

34:00.959 --> 34:02.258
I am done with all of this.

34:02.293 --> 34:04.527
Go get all your shit
and get out of my salon!

34:04.562 --> 34:06.395
Get out, Roller! I'm done with you!

34:06.431 --> 34:08.664
And I am done with you!

34:08.699 --> 34:10.157
Out!

34:11.536 --> 34:12.735
Get out!

34:12.770 --> 34:13.803
God damn it!

34:13.838 --> 34:15.972
Shit.

34:16.007 --> 34:18.608
Mmmm! Mm.

34:21.042 --> 34:22.678
Hey, gorgeous.

34:22.714 --> 34:25.181
Arlene, I need to talk to you.

34:25.216 --> 34:26.581
You okay?

34:27.716 --> 34:29.784
I just need to be with you.

34:29.821 --> 34:31.286
I'll be home in 30 minutes.

34:31.322 --> 34:32.637
Meet me there.

34:33.725 --> 34:35.791
Don't.

34:35.827 --> 34:37.592
I'm not sayin' nothing.

34:38.730 --> 34:41.764
Two words, ladies... water boarding.

34:41.799 --> 34:43.399
Technically that's one word.

34:43.434 --> 34:45.534
- Wire returned.
- Way to go.

34:45.570 --> 34:48.603
So, uh, Polly and I, does this
mean we're off the hook?

34:48.639 --> 34:51.274
Yep. You gave us
the bigger fish we needed.

34:51.309 --> 34:52.842
We're getting a warrant for an arrest.

34:52.877 --> 34:54.944
What's happening? Is he having a stroke?

34:55.744 --> 34:58.381
Is it just me, or are we gonna
miss working with each other?

34:59.498 --> 35:00.950
Definitely just you.

35:00.985 --> 35:02.184
Close the door.

35:07.392 --> 35:10.192
He was gonna kill me over
a piece of paper, Pol!

35:10.228 --> 35:12.695
Over a piece of paper!

35:12.730 --> 35:14.263
I know, I know, but, listen.

35:14.299 --> 35:16.627
It's gonna work itself out.
You know that.

35:16.662 --> 35:17.695
You have just gotta keep

35:17.720 --> 35:18.974
- playing your part...
- Mm.

35:19.009 --> 35:20.469
...until we're in the clear, okay?

35:20.505 --> 35:23.072
Start playin' your part right now.

35:23.107 --> 35:24.373
Right now.

35:25.276 --> 35:26.742
- Ladies.
- Hey.

35:26.778 --> 35:28.577
Hey, baby. Is everything okay?

35:28.613 --> 35:30.546
Yeah, yeah. You're crying.

35:30.581 --> 35:32.949
No, I was... I was laughin'.

35:32.984 --> 35:34.984
- Yeah, we was just laughing.
- I was telling them

35:35.019 --> 35:38.354
about when I was a backup
singer for Bell Biv DeVoe.

35:39.424 --> 35:40.890
Do it, Pol, do it.

35:45.830 --> 35:48.230
It was so funny.

35:48.266 --> 35:49.999
Oh, it just cracked us up.

35:50.034 --> 35:51.233
Whatever.

35:51.269 --> 35:52.668
What you doin' here?

35:52.704 --> 35:56.305
I'm supposed to cook
for you tonight, remember?

35:56.341 --> 35:59.141
Right. It's Thursday. I forgot.

35:59.933 --> 36:01.844
So, shall we go?

36:03.414 --> 36:05.314
Yeah. Yeah, let me get my stuff.

36:05.350 --> 36:07.044
- Don't we have a thing?
- We were supposed to watch

36:07.069 --> 36:08.184
a "Housewives" reunion tonight.

36:08.219 --> 36:09.251
- Yeah.
- Right?

36:09.287 --> 36:10.553
Yeah, y'all know what?

36:10.588 --> 36:12.421
I'm gonna catch up with y'all later

36:12.457 --> 36:17.026
and go spend a little time
with my fiancé.

36:17.061 --> 36:18.694
Okay, girl.

36:18.730 --> 36:19.829
Okay.

36:19.864 --> 36:21.530
I'll see y'all a little later.

36:21.566 --> 36:23.733
- Y'all be safe.
- Y'all have fun.

36:23.768 --> 36:25.001
Ladies.

36:25.036 --> 36:26.435
Good night, y'all.

36:26.471 --> 36:27.970
Have fun.

37:02.575 --> 37:04.508
- You okay?
- Yeah.

37:04.544 --> 37:05.943
I'm just, um...

37:05.978 --> 37:07.244
worried, you know.

37:07.280 --> 37:10.481
Jenn's husband is going
in surgery tomorrow, so...

37:11.004 --> 37:13.784
Oh. Well, let me take your mind off that.

37:16.823 --> 37:18.689
Um...

37:18.725 --> 37:20.791
You know what? I've been...
I've been thinking,

37:20.827 --> 37:22.993
and I know this might sound crazy.

37:23.029 --> 37:26.831
It would be so sexy

37:26.866 --> 37:30.568
for us to wait until our wedding night.

37:31.871 --> 37:34.338
But we've done it so many times before.

37:34.373 --> 37:35.773
You're not even religious.

37:35.808 --> 37:37.541
No, I-I know that I'm not,

37:37.577 --> 37:40.644
but it will make the night special.

37:40.680 --> 37:42.879
Come on. Stop teasing me.

37:42.879 --> 37:45.079
Mm, mm, mm.

37:45.115 --> 37:46.948
Mm. Just think about it.

37:46.983 --> 37:50.084
Think about the intensity.

37:50.120 --> 37:52.187
Like, all of that pent-up energy.

37:52.222 --> 37:54.355
Yeah, that's what I'm feeling now.

37:54.391 --> 37:55.890
- Mm.
- Yeah.

37:55.926 --> 37:57.358
- Okay, Greg.
- Yeah?

37:57.394 --> 38:00.328
Mm, I'm serious, okay?

38:00.363 --> 38:03.231
Trust me.

38:03.266 --> 38:06.134
It will be worth the wait

38:06.169 --> 38:08.403
when you see me in my wedding dress.

38:14.177 --> 38:15.610
Yeah?

38:15.645 --> 38:17.378
All right.

38:17.414 --> 38:19.147
Let me get us some more wine.

38:19.182 --> 38:21.382
Yeah.

38:21.418 --> 38:24.118
Might change your mind.

38:31.795 --> 38:33.161
No way, asshole.

38:38.935 --> 38:40.502
How was your day?

38:40.537 --> 38:42.170
Fine.

38:42.595 --> 38:44.472
Uneventful.

38:44.889 --> 38:46.674
Oh, here. Let me get that.

38:46.710 --> 38:48.476
I got this.

38:51.813 --> 38:53.815
You okay?

38:53.850 --> 38:55.517
No.

38:56.735 --> 38:59.120
Everything's gone sideways.

38:59.155 --> 39:01.189
What?

39:01.224 --> 39:02.490
Hey. Let me get your shoe.

39:02.526 --> 39:04.826
No, no, no. Stop it.

39:06.870 --> 39:08.963
Baby, come here.

39:08.999 --> 39:10.732
Come on.

39:12.035 --> 39:14.636
Sweetie, come on. Come on.

39:19.209 --> 39:21.175
What the hell happened?

39:22.812 --> 39:25.547
I work with some shitty people
who do some shitty things,

39:25.582 --> 39:27.015
and I got to get out of there.

39:30.018 --> 39:31.920
I never wanted this. I...

39:39.462 --> 39:40.728
Shh.

39:49.506 --> 39:52.173
Yes. So, hear me.

39:52.208 --> 39:54.409
I want all my men questioned.

39:54.444 --> 39:57.979
Toussaint, Ricardo, Pierre.

39:58.014 --> 40:01.583
I need to be sure
that no one from our side

40:01.618 --> 40:03.851
is responsible for this.

40:10.927 --> 40:13.761
And, also, check on all the Russians.

40:13.797 --> 40:15.096
Check!

40:22.138 --> 40:23.571
Good morning.

40:23.607 --> 40:26.507
Hey. Good morning.

40:26.543 --> 40:27.842
I thought you were sleeping.

40:28.576 --> 40:32.547
Yeah, my, um, Dean... brother called,

40:32.582 --> 40:35.383
and a lizard got in the house,

40:35.418 --> 40:37.619
and he's freaking out, so

40:37.654 --> 40:40.755
I got to head over there.

40:40.790 --> 40:44.525
Okay, so, I'll call you later?

40:45.632 --> 40:47.695
Call me later.

41:13.089 --> 41:15.123
Hey. I got an idea.

41:15.158 --> 41:17.392
Meet me at the spot... now.

41:19.963 --> 41:23.264
We're gonna plant the drugs
on one of the Russians...

41:23.299 --> 41:24.465
Boris.

41:24.501 --> 41:25.733
D, slow your roll.

41:25.769 --> 41:27.802
It worked with the Coombses, okay?

41:27.837 --> 41:30.938
And Ruval is already starting
to suspect Zlata's people,

41:30.974 --> 41:32.206
so we could.

41:32.242 --> 41:33.408
Uncle Daddy finna kill me.

41:33.443 --> 41:34.609
We movin' that shit.

41:34.644 --> 41:36.477
You ain't got to move all of it.

41:36.513 --> 41:39.314
- Come on.
- Yeah, and what's that gonna do?

41:40.350 --> 41:42.517
It's gonna start a war.

41:48.391 --> 41:50.366
Bogdan ain't my kid.

41:51.061 --> 41:52.427
What?

41:52.827 --> 41:54.395
They played me.

42:00.837 --> 42:04.072
Sorry to hear that, but don't worry.

42:04.923 --> 42:07.275
We gonna make 'em pay for all of it.

42:07.310 --> 42:09.110
Hmm?

42:58.118 --> 42:59.645
Did you hear from Roller yet?

42:59.681 --> 43:01.180
Not yet.

43:01.216 --> 43:03.716
And he should have been finished by now.

43:05.053 --> 43:07.220
You're late. And what are you doing here?

43:07.255 --> 43:08.955
I-I b-brought you some breakfast.

43:08.990 --> 43:11.457
V-Virginia said you had
to do inventory here.

43:11.820 --> 43:13.620
- Dean?
- Yeah?

43:13.656 --> 43:16.490
I want you to know you don't
have to worry about me, baby.

43:16.525 --> 43:17.792
I'ma be fine.

43:17.827 --> 43:19.274
But... But I brought you some breakfast.

43:19.299 --> 43:22.196
I brought you some, uh,
overnight oats with chia seeds

43:22.231 --> 43:24.665
and blueberries
and an egg white omelette.

43:24.700 --> 43:27.668
- You always take care of me, don't you?
- Yeah.

43:31.180 --> 43:32.758
Dean.

43:32.759 --> 43:34.403
Baby, listen to me.

43:34.438 --> 43:37.706
Things are about to change for us.

43:37.741 --> 43:41.143
All that bad road is gonna be behind us.

43:41.178 --> 43:44.312
It's gonna be like
it used to be, me and you.

43:44.348 --> 43:46.281
But d-does that mean we have to move?

43:46.316 --> 43:48.116
'Cause I like our new house, Desna.

43:48.152 --> 43:50.364
I'ma get you an even better house.

43:50.399 --> 43:51.853
A better house?

43:51.889 --> 43:53.488
- Yeah.
- A better house.

43:53.524 --> 43:55.924
- A better house, yeah.
- Yeah.

43:55.959 --> 43:57.259
How about we do something fun today?

43:57.294 --> 43:59.428
Why don't we go out,
spend the day together?

43:59.463 --> 44:01.129
We'll do whatever you want to do.

44:01.165 --> 44:02.898
C-Can't we go to Lido Beach
and fly a kite?

44:02.933 --> 44:05.000
Hell, yeah. You want to go right now?

44:05.035 --> 44:06.501
Yeah, now. Right now.

44:07.938 --> 44:10.038
Pol, cover for me?

44:10.074 --> 44:11.339
I'ma take Dean to the beach.

44:11.375 --> 44:13.041
Aww. Y'all have fun. I got you.

44:13.077 --> 44:14.409
I'll be right back, Virginia.

44:14.445 --> 44:16.078
I-I got to get some shorts
to go to the beach.

44:16.113 --> 44:17.679
Bye, Dean.

44:18.014 --> 44:20.715
You gonna put your shorts on,
put your legs out?

44:20.751 --> 44:23.418
I'm gonna put my shorts on, yeah.

44:23.454 --> 44:26.588
Dr. Bernardo. Paging Dr. Bernardo.

44:26.623 --> 44:28.490
Babe? I'm here.

44:28.525 --> 44:29.691
Oh. Okay?

44:29.726 --> 44:31.226
I love you so much.
I love you, too, baby.

44:31.261 --> 44:33.095
I love you.
You're gonna do so good, okay?

44:33.130 --> 44:34.601
And once we get you out of here,

44:34.636 --> 44:37.132
I'm gonna get us out of here.

44:37.167 --> 44:38.867
- What about some of this?
- Hey.

44:38.902 --> 44:39.968
Uh-oh. What about some of that?

44:40.003 --> 44:41.103
- Oh.
- Oh, you like that?

44:41.138 --> 44:42.367
- Yeah, I like it.
- All right.

44:42.402 --> 44:43.382
I'm gonna be right here

44:43.407 --> 44:44.417
- when you get out.
- Okay.

44:44.452 --> 44:45.479
And I love you, and
Brienne and Baylor love you,

44:45.515 --> 44:46.481
and we love you,

44:46.506 --> 44:47.776
- and you're gonna do so good.
- Yeah.

44:47.811 --> 44:49.077
- Okay.
- Okay?

44:49.113 --> 44:50.579
- I'm gonna do so good.
- Bye, my love.

44:50.614 --> 44:52.013
Bye, my love.

44:52.049 --> 44:53.682
They love me.

44:53.717 --> 44:55.117
I'm gonna do so good.

45:11.802 --> 45:14.436
What is this?! What is this?!

45:14.471 --> 45:16.605
You have something that belongs to me.

45:22.112 --> 45:24.212
- Where's the rest?
- Rest?

45:24.248 --> 45:25.814
I don't know where that came from.

45:36.760 --> 45:38.426
Pass me the cheese.

45:51.842 --> 45:54.743
Filthy Russians.

45:56.780 --> 45:58.201
It's been a long time since

45:58.226 --> 46:00.148
- we spent the day together.
- I know.

46:00.184 --> 46:01.583
Hey, after the beach, let's get

46:01.618 --> 46:03.885
some peaches and cream
lactose-free ice cream.

46:03.921 --> 46:05.554
Uh, yeah, with sprinkles.

46:05.589 --> 46:08.690
Uh, they're called jimmies, Desna.

46:08.725 --> 46:10.959
- Jimmies.
- I know.

46:10.994 --> 46:12.527
Uh-oh. I forgot my sunglasses,

46:12.563 --> 46:14.729
and exposure to the sun
can cause retinal damage.

46:14.765 --> 46:17.199
- All right. Hurry up.
- O-Okay.

46:25.876 --> 46:27.375
What you doing here, Arlene?

46:27.411 --> 46:29.411
You're under arrest for
money laundering and fraud.

46:29.446 --> 46:30.979
- I'm what? I'm...
- You have the right to remain silent.

46:31.014 --> 46:33.448
- What? Wha...
- Anything you say can and will be used

46:33.483 --> 46:35.684
- against you in a court of law.
- What is going on?

46:35.719 --> 46:37.953
Wait a minute. I didn't even do nothing.

46:37.988 --> 46:39.753
And to have an attorney
present during any questioning.

46:39.789 --> 46:42.224
Arlene! Don't touch my hair, bitch!

46:42.259 --> 46:43.743
Get in.

46:45.495 --> 46:46.928
Arlene!

46:46.964 --> 46:48.196
What?
