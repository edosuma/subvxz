00:23.796 --> 00:27.508
Theorising that one could time travel
within his own lifetime,

00:27.508 --> 00:30.928
Doctor Sam Beckett stepped into the
quantum leap accelerator

00:30.928 --> 00:32.637
and vanished.

00:37.518 --> 00:40.271
He woke to find himself trapped
in the past,

00:40.271 --> 00:43.899
facing mirror images
that were not his own...

00:43.899 --> 00:49.238
and driven by an unknown force
to change history for the better.

00:49.238 --> 00:53.200
His only guide on this journey is Al,
an observer from his own time,

00:53.200 --> 00:58.163
who appears in the form of a hologram
that only Sam can see and hear.

00:58.163 --> 01:02.126
And so Doctor Beckett finds himself
leaping from life to life,

01:02.126 --> 01:05.045
striving to put right
what once went wrong,

01:05.045 --> 01:10.884
and hoping each time that his
next leap will be the leap home.

01:15.347 --> 01:17.683
Well, are you gonna blow?

01:17.683 --> 01:20.811
Or wait till the whole house
burns down?

01:20.811 --> 01:22.938
Blow?

01:24.523 --> 01:26.400
Yeah, the candles.

01:31.322 --> 01:34.325
(SHRIEKING AND WHOOPING)

01:41.749 --> 01:45.252
We don't want to wear him out,
not before I can give him my kiss.

01:45.252 --> 01:47.087
Do we?

01:47.087 --> 01:49.089
(SHRIEKING)
Happy birthday!

01:49.089 --> 01:51.675
Ho ho! Oh, boy.

(WHOOPING)

03:15.759 --> 03:17.553
Who are those presents from?

03:19.096 --> 03:22.558
Mine first! That's mine.
It's yours, but from me.

03:22.558 --> 03:25.686
It's an old family heirloom.
I didn't know what to get you, so -

03:25.686 --> 03:27.688
Will you shut up
and just let him open it?

03:27.688 --> 03:29.815
I hope you like it.

03:29.815 --> 03:32.109
I'm sure I will.

03:32.109 --> 03:34.820
(LAUGHTER)

03:34.820 --> 03:37.698
You gave Gilbert a marble
for his birthday.

03:37.698 --> 03:40.659
It's not a marble.
It's a glass eye.

03:40.659 --> 03:43.412
It belonged to my grandfather.

03:43.412 --> 03:46.165
He said that everyone
who owns it brings luck to.

03:46.165 --> 03:48.584
Everyone except Gramps, of course.

03:48.584 --> 03:51.921
Will you just be quiet?
Why don't you just make me?

03:51.921 --> 03:53.839
Why don't you just get
out of my face?

03:53.839 --> 03:55.883
Runt!
(CHIMING)

03:58.218 --> 04:00.846

Ladies, lick your lips
and swivel your hips.

04:05.309 --> 04:07.102
(WHOOPING)

04:07.102 --> 04:09.146
Should you go out there dressed
like this?

04:09.146 --> 04:12.233
Gilbert...are you OK?

04:13.901 --> 04:16.237
Yeah. Yeah, no, I'm just...

04:16.237 --> 04:19.240
I got excited about the presents
and the party.

04:19.240 --> 04:21.784
Oh, did I miss a party? Damn!

04:21.784 --> 04:26.247
Well, you just relax
and take it easy.

04:26.247 --> 04:29.291
That's one of the advantages
of being the birthday boy.

04:29.291 --> 04:33.170
Yeah, well...
I'll show you a few more later.

04:33.170 --> 04:35.256
I bet she can, too.

OK, girls...

04:43.013 --> 04:45.140
put on your smiles...

04:45.140 --> 04:48.978
and everybody think, 'Virgin'.

04:48.978 --> 04:52.314
(WHOOPING)
Hello, boys!

04:52.314 --> 04:55.526
Welcome to the best damn cat house
in New Orleans.

05:03.492 --> 05:05.661
She's kinda cute.

05:06.704 --> 05:08.872
I think she likes you too.

05:08.872 --> 05:11.000
She doesn't like me, Al.
She likes...

05:15.504 --> 05:18.966
I think she likes him.
Technically speaking, that's you.

05:18.966 --> 05:21.135
For a while, anyway.

05:21.135 --> 05:24.305
What's going on, Al?
That's easy. That's easy.

05:24.305 --> 05:27.933
These guys are here to get - I know
what these guys are here to get.

05:27.933 --> 05:32.021
Give me a break. Oh, you mean,
what's happening with you? Oh...

05:32.021 --> 05:35.941
Uh...let's see. August 4th, 1961.

05:35.941 --> 05:39.278
Your name is Gilbert Labante,

05:39.278 --> 05:43.407
owner and operator of the Labante
Sewing and Quilting Academy.

05:43.407 --> 05:46.201
Quilting Academy? I thought you told
me this was a brothel.

05:46.201 --> 05:50.956
It is. This house has been in
operation since the Civil War.

05:50.956 --> 05:54.460
Your great grandfather,
or Gilbert's great-grandfather,

05:54.460 --> 05:56.337
started this place.

05:56.337 --> 05:58.380
But why a quilting academy?
What is that?

05:58.380 --> 06:00.466
Well, in those days, it was common

06:00.466 --> 06:04.053
for a bordello to hide behind
the cover a legitimate business.

06:04.053 --> 06:09.600
But believe me, Sam, the only thing
being sewn out there are wild oats.

06:09.600 --> 06:11.477
Al, what am I doing here?

06:12.561 --> 06:14.521
Huh? Oh, we don't know.
What?

06:14.521 --> 06:19.610
Yet. Ziggy is still searching
for the original history.

06:19.610 --> 06:23.489
If Ziggy's still running down the
history what are you doing here?

06:23.489 --> 06:26.825
Oh, no. You came for the girls,
didn't you?

06:26.825 --> 06:29.453
You came for the girls.
I can't believe that.

06:29.453 --> 06:32.873
Come on, Sam. Do you realise
what that is out there?

06:32.873 --> 06:36.001
That's Shangri-La. That's Utopia.

06:36.001 --> 06:37.795
Look.

06:41.757 --> 06:43.842
It's the mother lode.

06:45.261 --> 06:46.804
Oh...

06:48.055 --> 06:50.849
Ready for some good times? Some fun?

06:53.018 --> 06:55.854
That is one of the saddest things
I've ever seen.

06:55.854 --> 06:58.190
Sad? It's tragic.

06:58.190 --> 07:00.359
You think so, too?

07:00.359 --> 07:03.195
Sure. A joint like this
should have an elevator.

07:04.280 --> 07:06.156
Come here.

07:06.156 --> 07:08.158
Having to walk up the stairs.
Al, go away.

07:08.158 --> 07:12.079
Go away. Don't come back until you
know why I'm here, all right?

07:12.079 --> 07:16.166
You don't need to be here. There's
nothing for you to see here.

07:16.166 --> 07:18.586
Of all the partners
in the whole wide world

07:18.586 --> 07:21.130
that I should have to pick,
what do I end up with?

07:22.006 --> 07:23.966
The prudent prince.

07:35.436 --> 07:37.313
What are you looking at?

07:37.313 --> 07:39.815
Talking to yourself again?
No, not really.

07:39.815 --> 07:42.610
Don't be embarrassed.
It's perfectly normal

07:42.610 --> 07:44.945
for bridegrooms to be nervous.

07:44.945 --> 07:47.281
Bridegroom?
Have you thought about a date yet?

07:47.281 --> 07:50.034
Pushing again, aren't I?

07:50.034 --> 07:52.786
It's just that, well,
we're not getting any younger.

07:52.786 --> 07:56.290
I'm sorry.
There's no reason for you to do -

08:00.044 --> 08:02.546
Ow! You're hurting me. Let me go!

08:02.546 --> 08:04.798
Gilbert, you'd better get out here.
Quick!

08:04.798 --> 08:07.217
Let go of my arm.
What's wrong?

08:07.217 --> 08:09.011
Is there a problem here?

08:10.220 --> 08:12.932
Who are you?
I'm the owner of this house.

08:12.932 --> 08:14.850
Oh, really?

08:14.850 --> 08:17.561
Well, you're just the man
I want to see.

08:17.561 --> 08:20.731
Your girl here doesn't want
to go upstairs.

08:22.608 --> 08:24.860
I thought we could get to know
each other first.

08:24.860 --> 08:28.948
Now each other? Sweetheart, I don't
want to know you. I just want to -

08:28.948 --> 08:31.325
Just let go of her, OK?
Hey!

08:32.784 --> 08:35.788
Now, just what the hell kind
of cat house is this, anyway?

08:35.788 --> 08:37.789
One with rules. And the first rule

08:37.789 --> 08:40.167
is nobody does anything
they don't want to do.

08:40.167 --> 08:42.126
Oh, really?

08:42.126 --> 08:44.087
Ha ha!

08:44.087 --> 08:46.882
Says who?
Says me and this shotgun.

08:46.882 --> 08:48.842
(COCKS SHOTGUN)

08:50.511 --> 08:53.013
Now, lady, you'd better be careful
with that thing

08:53.013 --> 08:55.099
cos you know
it might accidentally go off.

08:55.099 --> 08:57.726
If it goes off,
it won't be no accident.

08:57.726 --> 09:04.984
Now, if I was you, I'd sail that
battleship of yours out of here!

09:04.984 --> 09:07.695
Before I turn you into a dinghy.

09:07.695 --> 09:10.739
Ha ha! She's hot, man! She's hot.

09:13.033 --> 09:16.036
Come on, let's get out of here.
Let's go and find some real women.

09:16.036 --> 09:17.955
Yeah!

09:25.296 --> 09:28.591
Don't thank me. I probably would
have killed all of you.

09:28.591 --> 09:31.218
And if my gumbo is ruined,

09:31.218 --> 09:33.262
I just might come back
and finish the job.

I'm feeling a little bit sick.
I think I need a drink of water.

09:49.403 --> 09:51.280
Good evening.

09:51.280 --> 09:53.866
Have I the pleasure of speaking
with Mr Labante?

09:53.866 --> 09:56.410
Uh, yeah, right. That would be me.

Red-headed, about 20 years old.

10:04.043 --> 10:06.128
Well, I'm really not sure.

10:06.128 --> 10:09.632
I think we have
what you're looking for. Paulette.

10:09.632 --> 10:11.425
Come here, honey.

10:12.968 --> 10:15.346
I'm sure Paulette
can meet your needs.

10:15.346 --> 10:18.307
No, no, I'm sorry.
I didn't make myself clear.

10:20.184 --> 10:23.812
I'm not looking for...
entertainment.

10:23.812 --> 10:26.273
I'm...ahem...looking
for a student of mine.

10:26.273 --> 10:28.525
Student?
Yes.

10:29.526 --> 10:32.238
My name is Dorliak. Jake Dorliak.

10:33.072 --> 10:34.949
I run a girls' finishing school.

10:34.949 --> 10:38.577
And, well, one of our girls ran off

10:38.577 --> 10:42.164
and I'm trying to find her
and bring her back.

10:42.164 --> 10:45.292
Before her parents find out,
is that it?

10:46.418 --> 10:49.505
I'd like to spare them the
embarrassment of finding her in -

10:49.505 --> 10:51.423
Cat house!

10:51.423 --> 10:54.927
That wouldn't look too good for you,
would it?

10:54.927 --> 10:56.762
Darling.

10:57.846 --> 11:01.392
I'm sorry, but...we can't help you.

11:01.392 --> 11:05.145
Can't or won't?
She said 'can't'.

11:06.313 --> 11:08.232
Yes, she did.

11:08.232 --> 11:10.359
Yes, I apologise.

Well, I'll go talk to her?
No, no, no, I'll go and do it.

11:38.220 --> 11:41.682
And a dash of bug juice
to add some starch to your stock.

11:41.682 --> 11:43.684
What is that?

11:43.684 --> 11:47.897
Plantain and banana skins, lots
of apples, gumnuts and whiskey!

11:47.897 --> 11:50.524
You got a strong stomach.
If she had a strong stomach,

11:50.524 --> 11:52.401
she wouldn't need that.

11:52.401 --> 11:54.653
Go ahead, child. Drink it all down.

11:55.821 --> 11:58.824
Urgh! That's the most disgusting
thing I ever tasted.

11:58.824 --> 12:00.701
But you'll soon feel better.

12:00.701 --> 12:05.122
Well, since it ain't supper time,
I guess he's here to talk with you.

12:05.122 --> 12:07.207
Stir my gumbo!
Yes, ma'am.

12:07.207 --> 12:09.335
Now, don't you be sassing me.
No...

12:14.298 --> 12:17.051
You must be feeling pretty bad
to drink that stuff, huh?

12:17.051 --> 12:19.178
Oh, I've just got an upset stomach.

12:19.178 --> 12:21.305
Maybe it's just nerves.

12:21.305 --> 12:23.515
I'll be better in a few minutes.
Mm.

12:25.351 --> 12:27.394
What are you doing here, Gina?

12:27.394 --> 12:31.357
Look, I'm real sorry about
that sailor, but he was a jerk.

12:31.357 --> 12:34.235
And that's why you didn't go upstairs
with him?

12:34.235 --> 12:38.364
Oh, well, no, I didn't go upstairs
with him because he smelled.

12:38.364 --> 12:40.366
Gina -

12:40.366 --> 12:42.326
I need to get back up there.

12:42.326 --> 12:44.411
I'm sorry.
It won't happy again, I promise.

12:47.456 --> 12:49.541
She's right, Sam.
What?

12:49.541 --> 12:54.588
Well, there's a 98.6% chance that
she'll never even have the chance

12:54.588 --> 12:56.674
to turn down a customer again.

12:56.674 --> 12:58.634
Is that good news? What?

12:58.634 --> 13:01.470
That's bad news. Why is Ziggy
always giving us bad news?

13:01.470 --> 13:03.722
Once in a while you'd think
we'd get good news.

13:03.722 --> 13:06.350
Some time in the next 24 hours,
she disappears.

13:07.518 --> 13:10.854
In a month her body
is found in a swamp.

13:11.981 --> 13:14.817
And, apparently,
she was beaten to death.

13:23.242 --> 13:27.079
Al, if she doesn't die for a month,
what are we doing here now?

13:27.079 --> 13:29.415
Well, according to Ziggy,

13:29.415 --> 13:32.835
whatever happened that caused her
death started here.

13:32.835 --> 13:38.007
But her body was found up near Lake
Charles and that's 160 miles away.

13:38.007 --> 13:40.426
But that's also where Gina's from
originally.

13:40.426 --> 13:42.470
I don't suppose anyone was arrested.

13:42.470 --> 13:46.015
We don't know. Ziggy's still trying
to get the local police records.

13:46.015 --> 13:47.892
Trying?
Yeah.

13:47.892 --> 13:51.729
They weren't exactly big on filing
systems at the smaller parishes,

13:51.729 --> 13:55.066
but he's trying to get something.
What about the New Orleans Police?

13:55.066 --> 13:58.069
Well, we've got a better shot with
them. They say they got a couple

13:58.069 --> 14:01.364
of people that say they spotted
a girl matching Gina's description

14:01.364 --> 14:04.992
leaving the Adams Hotel with
a man on the night she vanished,

14:04.992 --> 14:07.703
which, by the way, is tonight.

14:07.703 --> 14:09.872
Oh, great. That's great.

14:09.872 --> 14:13.584
So, less than 24 hours to figure out
who kidnaps her and when.

14:13.584 --> 14:16.838
Yeah, well, a case like this,
everyone's a suspect.

14:16.838 --> 14:20.091
So keep your eye on Gina
and don't lose her.

14:20.091 --> 14:22.176
I've got a funny feeling about her,
Al.

14:23.177 --> 14:24.929
I thinks she's as lost here as I am.

14:33.104 --> 14:34.981
Feeling better?

14:34.981 --> 14:37.733
A little.

14:37.733 --> 14:39.861
You almost blew everything
with that sailor.

14:41.154 --> 14:44.574
I know. I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to cause any trouble.

14:45.867 --> 14:48.870
If Gilbert finds out you're my
cousin and not a working girl,

14:48.870 --> 14:51.122
he'll throw us both out.

14:51.122 --> 14:53.249
And I can't let that happen.

14:55.418 --> 14:57.753
Now, are you gonna tell me
what you're doing here?

14:59.088 --> 15:00.882
I'm gonna have to pinch you.

15:02.091 --> 15:05.511
Well, I told you, I just couldn't
stay in Lake Charles any more.

15:05.511 --> 15:09.724
I know. You had to get out
and see the world.

15:09.724 --> 15:11.976
Isn't that why you left?

15:13.186 --> 15:15.229
I don't know.

15:16.397 --> 15:19.317
It's been so long,
it's hard to remember any more.

15:20.318 --> 15:22.069
How come you never came back?

15:24.614 --> 15:28.785
They don't exactly roll out the red
carpet for women like me.

15:29.869 --> 15:34.457
Besides, Gilbert and I
are getting married.

15:35.708 --> 15:37.668
You really love him, don't you?

15:37.668 --> 15:40.254
I don't know if love
is what you call it.

15:43.508 --> 15:45.635
When I was a kid,
I remember thinking

15:45.635 --> 15:48.471
you were the most beautiful girl
I'd ever seen.

15:48.471 --> 15:51.682
You had every boy in town
chasing after you.

15:53.184 --> 15:55.019
Yeah.

15:56.062 --> 15:57.939
And most of 'em caught me.

16:01.150 --> 16:04.737
Gina...this isn't
some dime store novel.

16:06.322 --> 16:09.784
It's real...and it's cold.

16:09.784 --> 16:12.620
And it's no place
for a kid like you.

16:12.620 --> 16:14.956
Go home.

16:16.666 --> 16:20.545
I can't. I mean, there's just
nothing there for me any more.

16:21.796 --> 16:23.673
Yeah, well...

16:23.673 --> 16:26.342
I guess we got that in common,
anyway.

16:39.689 --> 16:42.358
I'm just real sorry to hear
about your momma passing.

16:45.445 --> 16:47.488
Just watch your step, OK?

16:47.488 --> 16:49.949
Gilbert won't hesitate
in throwing us out

16:49.949 --> 16:52.076
if he finds out
we've been lying to him.

16:58.708 --> 17:01.210
Marsha, thanks for helping me out.

17:04.672 --> 17:06.758
You're about the only family
I got left.

17:12.805 --> 17:16.601
Oh, this looks so good.

17:16.601 --> 17:18.560
God, I wish I could smell it.

17:18.560 --> 17:22.773
Sam, you haven't lived until
you've tasted real crawfish gumbo.

17:22.773 --> 17:26.861
With the spices and the little legs
of the crawfish -

17:26.861 --> 17:29.655
Would you stop talking about
the food? But it's so good.

17:29.655 --> 17:33.701
Stop talking about food.
I gotta figure out a way
to stop Gina from disappearing.

17:33.701 --> 17:36.037
Well, Ziggy says
there's a 60% chance

17:36.037 --> 17:38.289
that she's taken from this house.

17:41.709 --> 17:43.795
Then I'll just shut it down.

17:43.795 --> 17:46.130
What?
The house. I'll shut the house down.

17:46.130 --> 17:48.091
No good.
What do you mean, no good?

17:48.091 --> 17:51.511
I already ran that scenario past
Ziggy and he said it's too risky.

17:51.511 --> 17:53.763
She could leave
and then you'd lose control -

17:53.763 --> 17:55.932
Well, what else am I -?
It's better this way.

17:55.932 --> 17:58.351
You know where she is.
You just have to find a way

17:58.351 --> 18:00.228
to keep her away from strangers.

18:00.228 --> 18:03.397
Excuse me, Gilbert.
The boys from Shreveport are here.

18:08.486 --> 18:10.488
Play something religious.

18:12.949 --> 18:15.785
Howdy.
Would you be Gilbert Labante?

18:15.785 --> 18:17.912
That would be me, yes.
It would be er...

18:17.912 --> 18:21.999
I'd be talking of them,
if I'd had my brothers.

18:24.919 --> 18:31.592
So this is the famous Labante
Sewing and Quilting Academy.

18:31.592 --> 18:34.095
How did you fellas find out about us,
anyway?

18:34.095 --> 18:37.849
Chester Desparday told us about you.
Chester Desparday?

18:37.849 --> 18:40.560
Chester only owns the biggest
filling station in town -

18:40.560 --> 18:42.437
three pumps and a lift.

18:42.437 --> 18:46.107
Remember he was here last year at
that big truck tyre convention?

18:46.107 --> 18:48.568
Gee, we must have missed that one.

18:48.568 --> 18:52.280
He said if you wanted
to have a good time in New Orleans,

18:52.280 --> 18:55.450
Gilbert Labante was the man to see.
Here you are.

18:55.450 --> 18:57.535
Here you are.

18:57.535 --> 18:59.537
Here I am, all right.

18:59.537 --> 19:01.539
Are you guys part of a club
or something?

19:01.539 --> 19:03.708
Club? Oh, you mean these.

19:03.708 --> 19:07.712
Hell, no, we won these from some
guys in poker game in our hotel!

19:09.046 --> 19:11.048
What hotel would that be?

19:11.048 --> 19:13.509
Well, the Adams. Why?

19:14.427 --> 19:16.220
No reason.

19:16.220 --> 19:17.805
Listen -

19:17.805 --> 19:19.640
You'd better get rid of these guys

19:19.640 --> 19:22.560
because one of them might be the guy
that takes off with Gina.

19:22.560 --> 19:25.438
Do we pay you before or after?

19:25.438 --> 19:27.607
Before or after what?
Before or after what?!

19:29.192 --> 19:32.069
Before or after that. No, no.

19:32.069 --> 19:35.573
Before we can really get into that,
we erm...

19:41.162 --> 19:43.623
We have to sing.
What?

19:43.623 --> 19:45.625
No, we don't sing.

19:45.625 --> 19:48.419
Guys, it's a new policy.

19:48.419 --> 19:51.130
See, before we can do that,

19:51.130 --> 19:53.508
er...we all have to sing.

19:53.508 --> 19:55.927
It helps everybody relax.
Sing?

19:55.927 --> 19:59.347
Wait. Chester didn't say anything
about no singing, did he, boys?

19:59.347 --> 20:02.058
This is a new policy.

20:02.058 --> 20:04.185
I gotta tell you
that the girls really like it.

20:04.185 --> 20:06.020
But also if you don't want to sing,

20:06.020 --> 20:09.732
I will totally understand if you want
to take your business somewhere else.

20:09.732 --> 20:12.485
Well, we did hear a lot of good
things about this place.

20:12.485 --> 20:14.487
but there ain't no way in hell
we're gonna...

20:17.115 --> 20:19.784
♪ Oh, when the saints

20:19.784 --> 20:21.994
♪ Go marching in

20:21.994 --> 20:26.040
♪ Oh, when the saints go marching in

20:26.040 --> 20:30.002
♪ I wanna be in that number

20:30.420 --> 20:34.215
♪ When the saints
go marching in... ♪

20:35.716 --> 20:38.636
♪ If one of those bottles should
happen to fall

20:38.636 --> 20:41.139
♪ Two bottles of beer on the wall

20:41.139 --> 20:43.266
♪ Two bottles of beer
on the wall... ♪

20:43.266 --> 20:46.227
What are we gonna do, Al? I'm
running out of beers on the wall.

20:46.227 --> 20:50.523
I don't know. Well, you could
always say, 'One more time.'

20:50.523 --> 20:53.734
I don't know. I didn't know they
were gonna hang on this long.

20:53.734 --> 20:57.196
But you've got to think of something
real annoying to get rid of 'em.

20:57.196 --> 21:00.032
More annoying than that?
Yeah, if you want to get rid of 'em.

21:00.032 --> 21:02.326
(CHEERING)

21:02.326 --> 21:05.872
Boys, boys, now, that was fun,
wasn't it?

21:05.872 --> 21:09.333
Because time just flies
when you're having fun like that.

21:09.333 --> 21:11.210
So why don't we erm...?

21:11.210 --> 21:14.088
Why don't we quit fooling around...

21:14.088 --> 21:16.966
and get to fooling around?

21:16.966 --> 21:19.051
(WHOOPING)

21:20.470 --> 21:22.889
Yeah, yeah, well,
that'd be all right,

21:22.889 --> 21:25.141
but I think maybe first
what we should try...

21:25.141 --> 21:27.852
is a game of charades.

21:27.852 --> 21:29.479
ALL: Charades?

21:29.479 --> 21:32.523
No, sir!
We ain't playing no more games.

21:32.523 --> 21:34.400
At least not with you, little buddy.

21:34.400 --> 21:38.321
Are we going to get
to touch these ladies...or not?

21:40.239 --> 21:44.035
(DOORBELL CHIMES DIXIE)
Bye, guys. Say hi to Chester for me.

21:44.035 --> 21:46.871
And you, cousin, are a wet blanket.

21:53.586 --> 21:55.755
Do you want to tell me
what that was all about?

21:55.755 --> 21:57.757
This ought to be a good one.

21:57.757 --> 22:01.511
Well, see, I felt like those guys
were trouble.

22:01.511 --> 22:05.139
You know, they kind of looked
like trouble to me.

22:05.139 --> 22:07.975
Oh, yeah, they were wild men,
all right?

22:09.310 --> 22:14.732
Gilbert, are you sure
you're feeling all right?

22:14.732 --> 22:16.692
Yeah, no, I'm fine. It's just...

22:16.692 --> 22:19.570
It's my birthday
and I've been thinking about it

22:19.570 --> 22:22.281
and I think we should celebrate
my birthday

22:22.281 --> 22:25.243
by just shutting down the house
for the night.

22:25.243 --> 22:28.162
Oh, now I know you're sick.

22:28.162 --> 22:31.457
Don't worry.
Momma's gonna make you feel better.

22:31.457 --> 22:33.960
You can't do that. I told you -

22:33.960 --> 22:36.254
Go tell everybody
that we're taking the night off.

22:37.422 --> 22:38.881
Goody!

22:38.881 --> 22:41.092
And then some other things too.

22:41.092 --> 22:42.885
Sam -
Al...

22:42.885 --> 22:45.471
I know what Ziggy says.

22:45.471 --> 22:48.266
That Gina might take off,
but I'm not gonna let that happen.

22:48.266 --> 22:50.309
What if you can't stop it?

22:50.309 --> 22:52.895
Look, Al, I can't ask every man
who walks in here to sing.

22:52.895 --> 22:55.815
So if I shut down the house,
nobody can get in.

22:55.815 --> 22:58.109
If nobody gets in,
then nothing can happen to Gina.

23:00.778 --> 23:02.905
Trust me.

23:03.865 --> 23:06.075
I know what I'm doing.

23:09.829 --> 23:13.166
According to Ziggy, shutting down
the house will accomplish nothing.

23:13.166 --> 23:15.334
Give it time.
He probably hasn't had time

23:15.334 --> 23:17.336
to compute all the new variables.

23:17.336 --> 23:22.133
Besides, the main thing is that
nobody will be able to get to Gina.

23:23.050 --> 23:25.011
Well, I hope you're right.

23:25.011 --> 23:27.764
Hey, that's my necklace.

23:27.764 --> 23:30.266
That's why they call it
a cat house.

23:30.266 --> 23:33.436
That makes it yours?
It sure doesn't it make it yours.

23:33.436 --> 23:36.481
It can't be yours because it's too
small to fit round your fat neck!

23:36.481 --> 23:38.649
How would you like
to be turned into lamb chops?

23:38.649 --> 23:40.943
Hey, hey, what's going on?

23:40.943 --> 23:43.154
Where's everybody going?

23:43.154 --> 23:45.323
We figured we'd go down
to the French Quarter.

23:45.323 --> 23:47.283
It isn't every day
you get the night off.

23:47.283 --> 23:49.452
That doesn't make any sense.
Does, too.

23:49.452 --> 23:52.580
How can you take a day off at night?
Sometimes you're such a...

23:52.580 --> 23:55.082
Where's Gina?
Oh, she's up in her room.

23:55.082 --> 23:58.169
I asked her to come with us, but
she said she wasn't feeling so hot.

23:59.754 --> 24:01.714
Good.

24:01.714 --> 24:03.800
Good?
I mean it's good.

24:03.800 --> 24:06.844
That you asked her to go with you.
Nice of you to think of her.

24:06.844 --> 24:08.888
Hey, Marsha,
ain't you gonna come with us?

24:08.888 --> 24:13.059
No, I thought I'd stay
and keep Gilbert company.

24:13.059 --> 24:14.560
Whoo!

24:14.560 --> 24:16.437
(WHOOPING)

24:18.648 --> 24:21.275
Bye.
See you later.

24:21.275 --> 24:25.363
You hit me one more time, Bo Peep,
you won't be peeping any more.

24:31.953 --> 24:35.248
I'd stick around too,
but I hate to see a grown man cry,

24:35.248 --> 24:38.126
especially when it's me.
Where are you going?

24:38.126 --> 24:41.045
I'm gonna slip into something
a little more comfortable.

24:47.510 --> 24:49.929
Boy, she's really got the hots
for this Labante guy.

24:49.929 --> 24:52.598
You can say that again.
She's really got the hots -

24:52.598 --> 24:55.518
Al. How long before they get married?

24:55.518 --> 24:57.770
They don't get married.
He marries Paulette.

24:57.770 --> 24:59.814
You told me that they were -

24:59.814 --> 25:02.233
I can see
you've got your hands full here,

25:02.233 --> 25:04.694
so I'm gonna go
and keep my eye on the girls.

25:04.694 --> 25:08.781
Al, come on. Don't you do anything
that I wouldn't do.

25:08.781 --> 25:10.950
But if you do, take pictures.

25:50.398 --> 25:52.108
Yes?

25:52.108 --> 25:54.277
May I come in?
Sure.

25:57.197 --> 26:00.492
I was just getting ready for bed.
To go to sleep.

26:00.492 --> 26:03.203
Oh, no, I know.
I'll just be here a second.

26:03.203 --> 26:05.371
Um...

26:06.790 --> 26:09.000
Is this your mom? She's pretty.
Mm-hm.

26:10.835 --> 26:12.837
You guys look an awful lot alike.

26:12.837 --> 26:14.839
People used to say we were sisters.

26:18.468 --> 26:22.222
Do you think she ever wonders
about what you're...doing

26:22.222 --> 26:24.265
or worries about you?

26:24.265 --> 26:26.226
My mom passed away
a couple of years back.

26:27.310 --> 26:29.187
Well, what about your father?

26:29.187 --> 26:32.649
My father left home when I was 15.

26:32.649 --> 26:34.818
And I haven't seen him since.

26:37.654 --> 26:39.489
I'm sorry.

26:40.865 --> 26:43.701
Were you left all alone.
Didn't you have any...?

26:43.701 --> 26:45.745
Relatives took me in.

26:48.206 --> 26:50.083
So, what are you doing here?

26:50.083 --> 26:52.544
It didn't work out.

26:55.839 --> 26:58.133
It can't be any better here.

27:02.137 --> 27:04.430
Gina, what are you running
away from? Nothing.

27:04.430 --> 27:07.559
Well, you don't belong here.
I mean, that is obvious.

27:07.559 --> 27:10.353
Are you saying you want me to leave?
No, no.

27:10.353 --> 27:13.148
I don't want you to leave.
I just feel like...

27:14.274 --> 27:18.361
..maybe if you find a way to confront
whatever it is you're...

27:19.821 --> 27:21.990
..running away from...

27:21.990 --> 27:25.368
that maybe you wouldn't be afraid
any more.

27:25.368 --> 27:29.164
And then maybe you wouldn't have
to be here.

27:29.164 --> 27:31.332
I'm not afraid.

27:33.543 --> 27:35.587
Well, I just think that...

27:37.338 --> 27:39.466
I need to go to bed now.

27:42.635 --> 27:44.304
OK.

27:52.604 --> 27:54.647
You know...

27:55.774 --> 27:57.901
..you're a lot stronger
than you think.

28:20.131 --> 28:21.925
Do you like my new outfit?

28:25.553 --> 28:30.058
Yeah. I mean, ahem, yeah,
it's very nice.

28:31.267 --> 28:33.353
I bought it for you.

28:33.353 --> 28:36.981
Well, I doubt if it's exactly
my size, but...

28:36.981 --> 28:39.692
you know,
it's the thought that counts.

28:39.692 --> 28:43.404
It's been a long time since we've
had the whole house to ourselves.

28:43.404 --> 28:45.907
Which opens up so many...

28:46.991 --> 28:48.868
..possibilities.

28:48.868 --> 28:52.664
Well, let's not forget that we don't
have the whole house to ourselves?

28:52.664 --> 28:54.582
Gina's upstairs.

28:54.582 --> 28:57.001
And we're down here.

28:59.003 --> 29:02.674
I think it's time I unwrapped
your birthday present.

29:03.800 --> 29:05.677
Don't you?

29:08.012 --> 29:09.597
Oh, boy.

29:10.849 --> 29:12.684
Gina?

29:12.684 --> 29:14.394
Jake, what are you doing here?

29:15.520 --> 29:17.522
I came, to see you, honey.

29:18.690 --> 29:21.234
Your momma's lucky she died.

29:23.987 --> 29:25.947
Saved her from seeing you like this.

29:29.242 --> 29:31.411
But you've changed your hair.

29:34.038 --> 29:36.416
It's nice.
Jake, there are people here.

29:39.627 --> 29:41.504
You mean that little pimp of yours?

29:43.381 --> 29:45.341
I don't think he's much of a threat.

29:45.341 --> 29:47.093
Do you?

29:48.636 --> 29:50.722
How did you find me?

29:51.931 --> 29:54.934
I found this in your scrapbook.

29:58.188 --> 30:00.398
I asked around and found out...

30:00.398 --> 30:04.569
you had a cousin who...
worked in New Orleans.

30:05.862 --> 30:09.115
I started at one end of the city
and I worked my way across...

30:09.115 --> 30:11.159
till I got here.

30:14.162 --> 30:16.623
I recognised her
when I was in here earlier.

30:22.545 --> 30:24.589
You shouldn't have left me, Gina.

30:26.633 --> 30:29.135
It didn't look good.
It did not look good at all.

30:33.973 --> 30:36.434
Everybody at school misses you,
Gina!

30:36.434 --> 30:40.063
Everybody's asking about you.
Now, what am I supposed to tell 'em?

30:40.063 --> 30:42.899
It's not what it looks like.

30:42.899 --> 30:45.151
I just needed a place to stay,
that's all.

30:45.151 --> 30:46.945
I was afraid.

30:50.031 --> 30:51.908
It's all over now, I swear.

30:53.827 --> 30:55.829
I swear.

30:57.914 --> 31:01.126
Now, you go ahead
and get your things together

31:01.126 --> 31:03.419
and we'll go home.

31:06.673 --> 31:07.882
No.

31:09.968 --> 31:12.220
What do you want from me, Gilbert.

31:12.220 --> 31:14.597
I don't want anything.

31:14.597 --> 31:17.225
Are you in love with her?

31:17.225 --> 31:19.394
Who?

31:19.394 --> 31:21.479
Gina.

31:21.479 --> 31:23.606
I've seen the way
you've been looking at her.

31:23.606 --> 31:25.692
Hovering over her.

31:28.111 --> 31:30.280
I guess it's pretty funny.

31:30.280 --> 31:33.241
That I'd lose you to somebody
in my own family.

31:33.241 --> 31:35.660
What are you talking about?

31:35.660 --> 31:37.579
I guess it doesn't matter any more.

31:39.831 --> 31:41.916
Gina.

31:41.916 --> 31:44.002
She's my cousin.

31:45.462 --> 31:48.006
She needed a place to stay.

31:48.006 --> 31:50.049
So I let her come here.

31:50.049 --> 31:52.302
I mean, she's not -
A whore?

31:54.220 --> 31:55.805
No.

31:57.891 --> 31:59.976
But I am.

31:59.976 --> 32:01.728
Aren't I?

32:06.232 --> 32:09.402
And that's the only thing you'll
ever be able to see me as.

32:14.783 --> 32:17.494
I am such a fool.

32:18.328 --> 32:20.914
I actually thought
I could start all over again.

32:22.123 --> 32:24.125
Like nothing ever happened.

32:26.878 --> 32:29.380
But it's too late.

32:30.381 --> 32:32.425
Isn't it?

32:35.261 --> 32:38.097
Because you'll never see me
as anything but this.

32:40.475 --> 32:42.227
Marsha...

32:44.187 --> 32:46.856
..it's never too late
to start all over again.

32:46.856 --> 32:49.150
It's just...

32:50.485 --> 32:53.404
..I'm not sure if I'm the one
to start over with.

32:57.075 --> 32:59.077
I mean, the truth is -
Argh!

32:59.077 --> 33:00.912
Jake!
Gina!

33:00.912 --> 33:02.747
Please!

33:08.346 --> 33:10.432
Why don't you try that on me?

33:14.853 --> 33:16.813
Gina, are you OK?
Yeah.

33:17.939 --> 33:19.482
Ugh!

33:19.482 --> 33:21.276
Stop it!

33:21.276 --> 33:24.821
Stop it! Jake,
you're gonna kill him. Stop it!

33:24.821 --> 33:27.198
Argh!
Jake!

33:31.077 --> 33:32.162
Argh!

33:34.831 --> 33:36.833
Gina, are you OK?

33:36.833 --> 33:38.752
Gina?

33:49.054 --> 33:50.722
Gina?

33:52.057 --> 33:54.267
Gina, can you hear me?

33:54.267 --> 33:57.771
Easy, easy, it's OK.
Everything's all right. He's gone.

33:59.481 --> 34:01.399
What happened?

34:01.399 --> 34:04.778
Well, you took a pretty good knock
to the head up here.

34:04.778 --> 34:07.030
Are you OK to talk about this,
ma'am.

34:07.030 --> 34:08.947
Who's he?

34:08.947 --> 34:12.034
Sherriff Nolan.
He needs to ask you some questions.

34:12.034 --> 34:14.036
What kind of questions?

34:14.036 --> 34:16.790
Did you know the man
that attacked you?

34:16.790 --> 34:18.291
No.

34:18.291 --> 34:20.085
So you've never seen him before?

34:20.085 --> 34:23.295
I just told you, I didn't know him.
OK, Gina...

34:23.295 --> 34:26.966
can you remember anything that would
give us a clue why he was here.

34:26.966 --> 34:30.178
He wanted to hurt me. You saw him.
He just wanted to hurt me.

34:30.178 --> 34:32.138
OK, all right. Just calm down.

34:33.264 --> 34:36.226
All you have to do now is just
give Sherriff Nolan a statement.

34:36.226 --> 34:38.061
That way you can press charges.

34:38.061 --> 34:40.897
I'm not pressing charges.
He's just a psycho.

34:40.897 --> 34:43.400
I just want to get out of here.

34:43.400 --> 34:45.193
I don't feel so good.

34:45.193 --> 34:48.571
Right, y'all just back up out of
here and give this child some air.

34:48.571 --> 34:51.491
I feel sick.
OK, honey, you just come with me.

34:58.373 --> 35:00.792
Well, that wasn't very much help.

35:00.792 --> 35:02.836
She knows him.

35:02.836 --> 35:05.213
She just said she didn't.
She knows him.

35:05.213 --> 35:07.549
Well, why would she do that?
I don't know.

35:08.758 --> 35:10.802
We'll have to ask Jake Dorliak.

35:11.052 --> 35:15.056
You just can't go out a hunting
a man in the middle of the night.

35:15.056 --> 35:17.392
We don't even know where he is.

35:18.476 --> 35:20.520
He's at the Adams Hotel.

35:20.979 --> 35:22.939
Now, how do you know that?
I just know.

35:24.190 --> 35:26.276
OK, let's just say
he is at the Adams.

35:26.943 --> 35:30.238
Without a complaint there's nothing
we can do if we find him.

35:31.281 --> 35:33.867
We can scare him.
Let him know that we know.

35:33.867 --> 35:35.910
You're getting -
We gotta do something

35:35.910 --> 35:37.704
or he's gonna end up killing her

35:37.954 --> 35:39.873
and I don't want that
on my conscience, do you?

35:40.957 --> 35:42.125
No.

35:49.340 --> 35:52.010
Let me handle this, if we find him.

35:52.010 --> 35:54.345
These type of situations
can be unpredictable.

35:54.345 --> 35:57.474
It takes an experienced lawman
to deal with these kind of -

35:59.225 --> 36:01.478
This is it.
You sure?

36:01.478 --> 36:03.563
Yeah, the desk clerk said Room 315.

36:05.148 --> 36:10.111
Good. Well, what we'll do is I'll go
in first and and you stay out here -

36:11.654 --> 36:14.657
He's still here.
Check on the bathroom.

36:15.784 --> 36:17.035
Right.

36:19.329 --> 36:20.914
Argh!

36:33.676 --> 36:35.678
Take it easy! You'll break his arm!

36:35.678 --> 36:39.057
Why are you trying to hurt Gina?
I wasn't trying to hurt her.

36:39.057 --> 36:41.101
I was trying to take her with me.
Why?

36:41.101 --> 36:43.478
Because she's my wife!

36:50.017 --> 36:51.893
No, that's all I need to know.

36:53.228 --> 36:55.522
Yeah, you give my love
to Claire for me.

36:55.522 --> 36:58.358
I'll do it. Bye-bye.

36:58.358 --> 37:01.528
What did he say?
Looks like he's telling the truth.

37:01.528 --> 37:03.822
He is the head
of a finishing school.

37:05.991 --> 37:07.909
Called Sherriff Budrow
in Lake Charles.

37:07.909 --> 37:09.995
He and Gina have been married
for two years.

37:09.995 --> 37:12.289
He's been married to Gina
for two years.

37:12.289 --> 37:15.751
I know that. So they're married.
He was still attacking her.

37:15.751 --> 37:17.961
Sherriff,
is my wife pressing charges?

37:17.961 --> 37:22.507
No, she's not. Then I guess
we're finished here. Are we?

37:22.507 --> 37:24.468
Yeah, I guess we are.

37:24.468 --> 37:27.220
Wait a second, Sheriff,
you can't just leave him here.

37:27.220 --> 37:30.974
I can't do anything without a crime.
Without a complaint I ain't got one.

37:30.974 --> 37:34.561
Well, I'll file a complaint, then.
I mean, he almost took my head off.

37:34.561 --> 37:38.231
You were coming at me.
You were beating a woman!

37:38.231 --> 37:40.484
I was trying to take my wife home.

37:40.484 --> 37:43.028
He's gonna kill her.
Sheriff, this is absurd.

37:43.028 --> 37:46.365
If she ain't pressing charges, it's
going to be your word against his.

37:46.365 --> 37:48.533
That's fine with you.
That's fine with me.

37:48.533 --> 37:50.619
You don't want to get into court
with this guy.

37:50.619 --> 37:52.663
He's a pillar of society.
He's a wife beater.

37:52.663 --> 37:54.831
And you own a whorehouse!

37:54.831 --> 37:57.417
What kind of credibility
do you think you're gonna have?

37:57.417 --> 38:00.003
Sam,
he's got a point there because -

38:00.003 --> 38:02.339
Gilbert, don't make me arrest you.

38:02.339 --> 38:04.383
Now, let's go.

38:09.096 --> 38:10.806
Mr Labante?

38:14.059 --> 38:16.353
Tell Gina I'm taking her home.

38:16.353 --> 38:18.438
Don't hit him, Sam.

38:25.737 --> 38:27.864
You're a real nozzle.

38:29.032 --> 38:31.118
Hmph.

38:31.118 --> 38:34.037
Gina, I want to help you,
but you've got to help me.

38:34.037 --> 38:36.540
You've got to press charges
against him.

38:36.540 --> 38:38.584
I can't.

38:38.584 --> 38:43.630
Look, I know he's your husband,
but he's also a very dangerous man.

38:43.630 --> 38:46.592
That's exactly
why I can't put him in jail.

38:46.592 --> 38:50.095
I don't know what he'd so if I got
him in trouble with the law.

38:51.221 --> 38:53.807
That doesn't make sense, Gina.

38:55.058 --> 38:57.269
So instead
you're just gonna go back to him?

38:57.269 --> 39:00.397
It's more complicated than that.
There's something you don't know.

39:00.397 --> 39:02.816
If I run, he'll just find me again.

39:02.816 --> 39:05.193
I don't want to be hiding
for the rest of my life.

39:05.193 --> 39:07.779
She's afraid for the baby.

39:07.779 --> 39:11.325
What? Wherever I go,
I know he'll find me.

39:11.325 --> 39:14.369
I had Zingy dig up
her autopsy report

39:14.369 --> 39:16.914
and she was four months' pregnant
when she died.

39:16.914 --> 39:20.000
That's why she's been sick.
That's probably why she ran away.

39:20.000 --> 39:23.170
She didn't want the baby to get
injured when he beat her.

39:25.005 --> 39:28.258
Gina, you're pregnant, aren't you?

39:28.258 --> 39:30.260
Pregnant?

39:31.511 --> 39:33.513
My God, why didn't you say anything?

39:35.641 --> 39:37.559
I was afraid.

39:39.061 --> 39:43.190
See, after Mom died,
Jake kind of took care of me.

39:43.190 --> 39:45.442
I mean,
he let me stay in school when...

39:45.442 --> 39:47.486
I didn't have to pay any money.

39:49.696 --> 39:52.074
He'd take me and my friends out
to dinner.

39:52.074 --> 39:54.242
I mean, he could be
very funny sometimes.

39:56.870 --> 39:59.122
Before I knew it, we were married.

40:01.250 --> 40:03.085
But then things changed.

40:06.088 --> 40:09.091
I never really got to know him
until it was too late.

40:09.091 --> 40:11.426
And he beat you, didn't he?

40:14.721 --> 40:16.723
I want this baby.

40:16.723 --> 40:18.767
And I'm not gonna do anything...

40:20.060 --> 40:23.772
I mean, maybe he'll change
when he knows about the baby.

40:25.399 --> 40:27.317
I can't run for ever.

40:27.317 --> 40:30.028
Come on, baby.

40:30.028 --> 40:32.030
We gotta put you to bed.

40:36.660 --> 40:39.871
I wish there was some way
we could get that SOB.

40:42.624 --> 40:45.377
Sam, you can't let her go back
with that maniac.

40:45.377 --> 40:48.213
According to Ziggy, she still dies.

40:48.213 --> 40:50.757
I wish there was some way
we could stop it.

40:51.925 --> 40:54.845
Well, we have to have a...
I'll think of a plan.

40:54.845 --> 40:58.181
We'll get this nozzle
and we'll trick him.

40:58.181 --> 41:00.475
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

41:00.475 --> 41:03.186
I'll wager that
that's knuckle nose now.

41:03.186 --> 41:05.105
(DOORBELL CHIMES DIXIE)

41:05.105 --> 41:07.149
Don't hit him.
Good afternoon.

41:08.483 --> 41:10.485
Are these Gina's things?

41:10.485 --> 41:12.279
Mm-hm.

41:12.279 --> 41:14.781
I'm glad she finally came
to her senses.

41:17.409 --> 41:19.828
Gina.
She'll be right with you.

41:19.828 --> 41:22.080
All right, ladies, let's do this.

41:23.373 --> 41:25.417
Here we go.
Where's Gina?

41:25.417 --> 41:28.712
She's upstairs.
I'll go get her.

41:28.712 --> 41:31.340
No, I would rather you just wait
right over here.

41:31.340 --> 41:33.425
She'll be down in a minute.

41:33.425 --> 41:35.469
What is all this?

41:35.469 --> 41:37.638
A graduation photo.
A grad -

41:37.638 --> 41:39.556
Graduation? In a whorehouse?

41:39.556 --> 41:42.893
This is the Labante Quilting
and Sewing Academy.

41:42.893 --> 41:45.646
You have graduation photos
at your school.

41:45.646 --> 41:49.066
We have graduation photos at ours.

41:49.066 --> 41:52.486
All right, ladies,
let's take this picture.

41:52.486 --> 41:55.572
Here we go. Everybody -

41:55.572 --> 41:57.574
Where's Sophie?

41:57.574 --> 42:00.160
Here I am!
Sophie, come on!

42:00.160 --> 42:02.162
I was on the phone with my mother.

42:02.162 --> 42:04.873
Oh! I'm so clumsy! I'm sorry!

42:04.873 --> 42:06.959
Would you just pick it up, please?

42:06.959 --> 42:09.044
Damn it, hurry up!

42:09.044 --> 42:11.338
As long as you're OK, Sophie.

42:11.338 --> 42:12.798
(CAMERA FLASH POPS)

42:14.341 --> 42:16.843
Was it good for you, honey?

42:16.843 --> 42:19.805
What's going on? What a stroke
of luck you happened to be here.

42:19.805 --> 42:24.268
This man is the headmaster of an
exclusive finishing school for girls.

42:24.268 --> 42:27.646
And I just happened to catch him in
the act of soliciting a prostitute.

42:27.646 --> 42:30.148
Wait - I am sure that
it's not the first time

42:30.148 --> 42:32.150
that this is happened.
That is a lie!

42:32.150 --> 42:36.446
You mean to say this man has
solicited the affections of more
than one of these women?

42:36.446 --> 42:38.782
He offered it to me.
Me too.

42:38.782 --> 42:40.659
And me.
And me.

42:40.659 --> 42:43.495
And he even offered it to me!

42:46.790 --> 42:48.792
This is never gonna work.

42:48.792 --> 42:50.669
I wouldn't be too sure of that,

42:50.669 --> 42:53.380
when your board
of directors see this photograph.

42:53.380 --> 42:56.258
My board of directors would never
believe such trash.

42:56.258 --> 42:58.802
Well, given the widespread reputation

42:58.802 --> 43:02.347
of the Labante Sewing and Quilting
Academy, they just might.

43:02.347 --> 43:06.351
So my advice to you, Mr Dorliak,
is you walk out that door

43:06.351 --> 43:09.438
and leave Gina alone and never,
ever try and see her again.

43:09.438 --> 43:11.690
She's my wife. I have rights.

43:11.690 --> 43:14.151
You gave that up the first time
you beat her. Excuse me.

43:16.194 --> 43:19.531
My compliments
to an elegantly played hand.

43:19.531 --> 43:22.409
But there are still two things
that remain unchanged.

43:22.409 --> 43:24.703
You are still a pimp.

43:24.703 --> 43:26.747
And they are still prostitutes.

43:26.747 --> 43:29.041
And you are still a wife beater.

43:30.125 --> 43:32.252
Go away, Jake.

43:32.252 --> 43:35.172
Or I will see to it that every last
person in Lake Charles knows

43:35.172 --> 43:37.341
what kind of person you really are.

43:37.341 --> 43:40.469
Gina - No, I don't have to be afraid
of you any more, Jake.

43:41.845 --> 43:43.639
Now, go away.

43:43.639 --> 43:45.265
Scum.

43:45.265 --> 43:47.225
You heard her. Go away.

43:47.225 --> 43:49.603
Or we'll run that picture
in the Lake Charles Gazette.

43:54.066 --> 43:57.110
(WHOOPING)

44:03.533 --> 44:07.329
Sam, Dorliak got so paranoid
about that photograph

44:07.329 --> 44:09.206
he never went back to Lake Charles.

44:09.206 --> 44:12.042
Not only that, his hot temper
got him in so much trouble

44:12.042 --> 44:15.254
that he ended up in the loony bin.
He never bothered anybody...

44:15.254 --> 44:17.464
Sherriff, thank you. Ladies!

44:17.464 --> 44:19.549
(WHOOPING)

44:22.594 --> 44:27.766
Well, it's nice to see things
getting back to normal around here.

44:27.766 --> 44:29.768
Al? Al?
Yeah?

44:29.768 --> 44:32.437
Is Ziggy sure that everything
works out OK with Gina?

44:32.437 --> 44:34.439
Oh, yeah.
You sure?

44:34.439 --> 44:36.400
Everything's fine.
She moves to Atlanta.

44:36.400 --> 44:38.360
She gets a job as a waitress.

44:38.360 --> 44:40.946
The she gives birth to a bouncing...

44:40.946 --> 44:42.906
baby boy.

44:42.906 --> 44:46.076
Oh, which she christens Gilbert.

44:46.076 --> 44:48.537
Gilbert? No kidding.

44:49.580 --> 44:51.498
Well, that's kind of -

44:55.002 --> 44:57.004
Marsha?

44:57.004 --> 44:58.880
Where are you going?

45:00.007 --> 45:03.885
I guess the only way to make a new
start is to be around new people.

45:05.262 --> 45:07.889
I guess you don't get much newer
than a baby.

45:07.889 --> 45:09.891
No, I guess you don't.

45:11.226 --> 45:13.020
Thanks.

45:14.438 --> 45:16.565
Good luck.

45:22.029 --> 45:23.614
Thanks.

45:23.614 --> 45:26.283
You take care of yourself.
I will.

45:27.576 --> 45:29.828
And that little baby boy -
if it's a boy.

45:33.332 --> 45:35.375
Bye.
Bye, Gina.

45:40.547 --> 45:43.508
I think I'm gonna go upstairs...

45:43.508 --> 45:47.137
and take a long hot bath.

45:49.640 --> 45:54.645
Uh...Sam, I think I'll do a little
exploring up there. You wanna come?

45:56.897 --> 45:58.732
Not this time.

46:00.025 --> 46:02.945
Oh, no. Sam, no, hey. Don't leave.

46:02.945 --> 46:04.905
No.

46:09.701 --> 46:11.787
(ROCK MUSIC)

46:27.886 --> 46:30.264
Are you gonna do it or not?

46:30.264 --> 46:31.890
Come on!

46:34.559 --> 46:36.478
Oh, boy!
