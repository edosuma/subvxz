WEBVTT

00:00.875 --> 00:03.833
(Playful chatter and laughter)

00:06.875 --> 00:09.666
Erica: When you're a kid,
being grown up looks so easy.

00:09.666 --> 00:11.375
Nobody tells you it's harder
than it looks.

00:11.375 --> 00:14.125
Judith: Okay, bibs, blankets,
a monitor...

00:15.958 --> 00:17.875
- I am totally getting these.

00:17.875 --> 00:21.125
Look it, little temporary
tattoos for babies.

00:21.125 --> 00:23.708
Oh, look it,
there's a little stroller,

00:23.708 --> 00:26.000
a little pacifier,
a little "I love Mom."

00:26.000 --> 00:28.791
It's cute, right?
Alyson: Yeah, it's more of
a novelty item.

00:28.791 --> 00:31.750
Focus on the must-haves -
what Judith really needs:

00:31.750 --> 00:34.958
a Bumbo, a Graco Snug Ride,
and the Daphne.

00:34.958 --> 00:37.166
- Chaz loves his Daphne.

00:37.166 --> 00:38.916
- Is that a stuffed animal?

00:38.916 --> 00:40.958
- It's a reclining plastic
bath seat.

00:40.958 --> 00:44.041
- Right, of course.
- Now, what about the highchair?

00:44.041 --> 00:46.875
You've got options.

00:46.875 --> 00:48.333
Erica: That those feelings
that you have,

00:48.333 --> 00:49.958
that you don't measure up,
that you're not keeping pace,

00:49.958 --> 00:51.208
they never go away.

00:51.208 --> 00:53.208
- So you must be the best friend
we've heard so much about.

00:53.208 --> 00:55.208
- Mm-hmm.
- You must be excited
for this baby.

00:55.208 --> 00:56.875
- Oh, I am.

00:56.875 --> 00:58.875
- And how are the preparations
for the shower coming?

00:58.875 --> 01:01.083
- Good! I mean, they're really
good. I'm almost ready.

01:01.083 --> 01:03.208
- Organizing these things
can be so much work.

01:03.208 --> 01:05.041
We threw one last year
for Marie's sister.

01:05.041 --> 01:06.708
I can recommend a really good
caterer if you want.

01:06.708 --> 01:08.375
- A caterer...

01:08.375 --> 01:10.916
Judith: Okay, Erica,
I need your opinion.

01:10.916 --> 01:13.083
- Yes.
- Anthony likes the green one,

01:13.083 --> 01:15.166
but I'm just, I'm not sure.

01:15.166 --> 01:17.041
What do you think?

01:18.708 --> 01:20.333
(High chair rattles lightly)
- (Perplexed) Wow.

01:20.333 --> 01:23.291
- No contest at all, Jude.
Lo-tech, high-tech.

01:23.291 --> 01:24.916
It reclines, it swivels, it's...

01:24.916 --> 01:26.375
It's got a five-point harness.

01:26.375 --> 01:27.791
- This is just much
more practical.

01:27.791 --> 01:29.083
- But the low-tech,
I mean, it's...

01:29.083 --> 01:31.000
It's really cute and...

01:31.000 --> 01:32.458
I like the wood,
it's more natural.

01:32.458 --> 01:34.875
- Yeah, it is cute,
and the wood is nice,

01:34.875 --> 01:37.375
and oh God, it costs about
the same as a Lamborghini.

01:37.375 --> 01:39.083
(Judith and Marie laugh,
cell phone rings)

01:39.083 --> 01:40.875
Oh, excuse me.

01:40.875 --> 01:42.708
- What?
- High chairs are pricey,

01:42.708 --> 01:45.166
but that's what
the Godmother is for, right?

01:47.625 --> 01:50.166
- God-Godmother?

01:50.166 --> 01:53.166
- Jude told you, didn't she?
- Marie, it was supposed
to be a surprise.

01:53.166 --> 01:54.875
- (Stammers) That's fine.

01:54.875 --> 01:57.041
I'll just-I'll pretend
like I don't know.

01:57.041 --> 01:59.041
Judith: Damn, you guys -
Ugh! I've gotta run.

01:59.041 --> 02:00.708
Anthony's got this
lunch thing and I'm--

02:00.708 --> 02:02.166
- Well, you can't go yet.

02:02.166 --> 02:03.833
We need to put the items
on the registry first.

02:03.833 --> 02:05.333
- Maybe we can coordinate
something.

02:05.333 --> 02:07.250
- You know what? You just go.
I'll deal with it.

02:07.250 --> 02:08.625
- Really?
- Yeah. No problem.

02:08.625 --> 02:11.416
- Okay.
Both: Muah!

02:11.416 --> 02:13.208
- Thank you.
- See you at the Shower.

02:13.208 --> 02:16.000
- Hey, looking forward to it!

02:16.000 --> 02:17.833
What do you do when you feel
like you're the only kid

02:17.833 --> 02:19.750
in a room full of adults?

02:19.750 --> 02:21.333
Well, the only thing
you can do:

02:21.333 --> 02:23.833
you smile, you step up, and
you try your best to fit in.

02:23.833 --> 02:26.958
Hi, there. Um, this is
Judith Winter's Registry.

02:26.958 --> 02:28.916
I just like to enter these
into the system,

02:28.916 --> 02:31.000
and can I include, um,
a delivery to my address?

02:31.000 --> 02:32.416
I'm hosting the baby shower.

02:32.416 --> 02:34.541
- Oh, great.
- Yeah.

02:34.541 --> 02:37.041
And... I-I-I would also like
to buy the wooden highchair.

02:38.750 --> 02:40.750
Wow, she must be
a really good friend.

02:40.750 --> 02:42.416
She is, and uh...

02:42.416 --> 02:44.416
it looks like I'm gonna
be the Godmother, so...

02:44.416 --> 02:48.083
- Oh, great.
Okay, so, debit or credit?

02:48.083 --> 02:50.708
- Um, whatever works. We'll see.

of candles there,

03:37.958 --> 03:39.375
and some classical music.

03:39.375 --> 03:40.916
- I think it looks great
the way it is.

03:40.916 --> 03:43.458
- No, no, it needs a more
of a mature vibe.

03:43.458 --> 03:45.083
I mean, it's...
it's a baby shower,

03:45.083 --> 03:46.500
it's not some kid's
birthday party.

03:46.500 --> 03:48.333
- Hey, do you see the um...
- What do you need?

03:48.333 --> 03:49.708
I think it's underneath there.
- That thing?

03:49.708 --> 03:52.416
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

03:52.416 --> 03:53.958
- Wow! You know, for $400,

03:53.958 --> 03:56.208
you'd think they'd include
instructions in English.

03:56.208 --> 03:58.333
- Wow. Some inheritance
I don't know about?

03:58.333 --> 04:00.916
- My best friend
is having a baby

04:00.916 --> 04:02.958
and I'm the Godmother.

04:02.958 --> 04:04.833
- Y-you?

04:04.833 --> 04:06.416
-Yes, me. Is that so hard
to believe?

04:06.416 --> 04:08.125
- No, no, not at all.
It's just um...

04:08.125 --> 04:09.958
Well, it's a big honor.

04:09.958 --> 04:11.458
- I know. Hey, why don't you
come by later.

04:11.458 --> 04:13.000
I'll put aside
some wine for you.

04:13.000 --> 04:15.208
- Thanks, but I don't think
you want guys around here.

04:15.208 --> 04:17.541
- No, it'll be fun.
I'm having it catered.

04:17.541 --> 04:19.958
Jenny's bringing the cake.
It'll be a lot of fun.

04:21.750 --> 04:23.666
- I'm going to Montreal.

04:25.125 --> 04:26.666
- Really?

04:28.291 --> 04:30.416
- Yeah, I think I need
to talk to Claire.

04:30.416 --> 04:32.791
- You don't have a long
distance calling plan?

04:32.791 --> 04:35.958
- No, I mean really talk to her.

04:35.958 --> 04:39.875
Look, I've had a month to think
about it and I just...

04:39.875 --> 04:43.666
I need to understand
what went wrong.

04:43.666 --> 04:46.333
- She cheated on you.
- Erica, I can't just end this

04:46.333 --> 04:48.333
and never talk to her again.

04:48.333 --> 04:49.875
I'm not going back
to reconcile, I just,

04:49.875 --> 04:53.250
I feel like...

04:53.250 --> 04:56.250
I just wanna...
feel that it's over.

04:58.250 --> 05:00.833
- No, I get it. Yeah, go and do
what you need to do.

05:03.166 --> 05:04.833
- Thanks.
(Door opens)

05:04.833 --> 05:06.708
Jenny: Code red.

05:06.708 --> 05:09.416
I don't have wrapping paper
or even a dorky gift bag.

05:09.416 --> 05:11.916
- Ah, in the bedroom,

05:11.916 --> 05:14.208
left side of the closet,
third shelf.

05:14.208 --> 05:17.625
- You know, a baby shower
is basically just rewarding
somebody for having sex.

05:17.625 --> 05:20.000
I have sex all the time.
Where is my reward?

05:20.000 --> 05:22.250
- I think it's
the "having sex" part.

05:22.250 --> 05:24.541
- Hmm.
- 'Kay, I'll be back Sunday
night.

05:24.541 --> 05:25.916
I'm supply teaching
Monday morning.

05:25.916 --> 05:28.583
- Okay.

05:28.583 --> 05:32.333
Well, listen, um...
drive safe, you know.
- Thanks.

05:32.333 --> 05:35.166
- And uh... well, good luck.
- Thanks.

05:38.041 --> 05:40.291
- Have fun.
- Okay. Thank you.

05:40.291 --> 05:42.083
- Bye.
- Bye.

05:45.916 --> 05:47.333
(Knock at the door)

05:47.333 --> 05:49.083
- What did you forget?

05:50.666 --> 05:52.083
What're you-
What're you doing here?

05:52.083 --> 05:54.041
Listen, Jenny's--
Jenny's in the bedroom.

05:54.041 --> 05:56.166
- I'm just checking in.
Interesting reading material.

05:56.166 --> 05:58.500
"A Girlfriends' Guide
to Pregnancy."

05:58.500 --> 06:01.166
- Judith made me the Godmother.

06:01.166 --> 06:04.000
- Really?
- Yeah.

06:04.000 --> 06:06.250
Why is that a surprise?
- Do I look surprised?

06:06.250 --> 06:08.125
I think if anyone's surprised,
it's you.

06:08.125 --> 06:09.541
- Okay, well, historically,
I haven't exactly, you know,

06:09.541 --> 06:12.000
been godmother material.

06:12.000 --> 06:14.458
Because the Godmother is
the one that, you know,
takes care of the child if...

06:14.458 --> 06:15.875
well, if something
were to happen.

06:15.875 --> 06:17.375
It's a lot of responsibility,
you know?

06:17.375 --> 06:20.541
You need a really secure, calm,
stable person for that job.

06:20.541 --> 06:22.833
- Oh, and that's not you?
- No, it never used to be.

06:23.458 --> 06:25.208
But, you know,
'cause I kind of always...

06:25.208 --> 06:27.416
I thought that I was more of
the wacky Aunt Erica type.

06:27.416 --> 06:29.375
But you know what?
I... I have a job now.

06:29.375 --> 06:31.750
Something that might lead
to an actual career and I...

06:31.750 --> 06:35.125
I mean, everything in my life
is falling into place,

06:35.125 --> 06:36.958
and Judith sees that.
Obviously, Anthony agrees.

06:38.458 --> 06:40.333
And I just think that...

06:40.333 --> 06:42.958
it's time that I started
seeing it too.

06:42.958 --> 06:45.333
(Approaching footsteps clomp)

06:45.333 --> 06:46.750
Jenny: Okay, does this just
look like shit,

06:46.750 --> 06:49.458
or some kind of avant-garde
origami?

06:49.458 --> 06:51.125
Hi.
- Hi.

06:51.125 --> 06:52.583
- Who are you?
- Uh, the neighbor.

06:52.583 --> 06:55.208
And he just came over
to borrow some of the um...

06:55.208 --> 06:57.083
some of that... there.

07:01.958 --> 07:03.583
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

07:03.583 --> 07:05.083
Why don't I show you out?

07:05.083 --> 07:06.583
- Sure.
- Okay.

07:06.583 --> 07:08.208
- Bye.
- Bye.

07:10.541 --> 07:11.958
- See you soon.

07:13.458 --> 07:15.041
- So... thoughts?

07:16.625 --> 07:18.541
- Wow. Um... why don't you
give me that

07:18.541 --> 07:21.250
and you can take out your
origami skills

07:21.250 --> 07:22.958
on those napkins.

07:22.958 --> 07:25.208
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,

07:25.208 --> 07:27.333
♪ How do we pass the time ♪

07:29.208 --> 07:31.583
♪ Everyday we'd climb ♪

07:31.583 --> 07:33.708
(Low hum of chatter)

07:33.708 --> 07:35.958
- And I've asked the caterer
not to put alcohol,

07:35.958 --> 07:37.416
obviously, in the petits fours.

07:37.416 --> 07:39.416
The cheese in the quiche
is pasteurized

07:39.416 --> 07:41.333
and the coffee is decaf.

07:41.333 --> 07:43.291
Wow, you had this catered?
- Of course!

07:43.291 --> 07:45.166
I'm not just gonna
throw something together.

07:45.166 --> 07:47.291
'kay, now as for you,
just relax,

07:47.291 --> 07:50.083
enjoy yourself.
Take a load off.

07:50.083 --> 07:52.000
If you need anything,
I'm at your beckon call.

07:52.000 --> 07:53.500
- Okay.
- Hi.

07:55.208 --> 07:56.625
Oh, okay.

07:56.625 --> 07:58.041
Hey, how are you?

07:59.625 --> 08:01.125
Oh, would you excuse me
for a second?

08:01.125 --> 08:04.708
(Hushed) Sam! Sam.

08:04.708 --> 08:06.416
You know if you keep
checking in on Josh,

08:06.416 --> 08:08.208
it's not gonna be
a very fun stag night.

08:08.208 --> 08:09.833
- I know. That's kind
of the point;

08:09.833 --> 08:11.375
I don't want it
to be too much fun.

08:11.375 --> 08:12.875
His best friend Ryan is in town

08:12.875 --> 08:14.916
and - ugh! They always
get into trouble.

08:14.916 --> 08:17.375
- Hmm.
- I told Josh no strippers,
and I meant it.

08:17.375 --> 08:20.208
Just keep it clean and classy,
just like this.

08:20.208 --> 08:23.083
Great party, by the way.
- Thank you. Thanks.

08:23.083 --> 08:24.750
I like to think I come by it
honestly.

08:24.750 --> 08:26.083
- Yeah, if this was one
of mom's,

08:26.083 --> 08:27.625
there would be a ton...

08:27.625 --> 08:29.125
Both: Of brisket!

08:29.125 --> 08:31.875
Jenny: There you are, Erica.

08:31.875 --> 08:33.750
How thoughtful of you
to provide wine

08:33.750 --> 08:36.166
for us non-pregnant types.

08:36.166 --> 08:37.500
(Under her breath)
What's that?

08:37.500 --> 08:39.208
- Oh, that is a Baby Bjorn.

08:39.208 --> 08:41.500
- How do you know that?
- Research.

08:41.500 --> 08:44.458
Hey, ladies! Um, Alyson
and Marie, this is Jenny.

08:44.458 --> 08:46.541
- Fabulous shower.
I love all the little details.

08:46.541 --> 08:48.500
- Thank you.
Thank-thank you.

08:48.500 --> 08:51.416
Um, would you ladies
like something to drink?

08:51.416 --> 08:53.375
- Sure.
- I have wine or...

08:53.375 --> 08:55.916
of course a plethora
of non-alcoholic drinks.

08:55.916 --> 08:58.791
I've got San Pellegrino
and, um, fruit juices.

08:58.791 --> 09:01.666
You know what? This elderberry
juice is delish.

09:03.166 --> 09:06.708
Try some on ice?

09:06.708 --> 09:08.125
- Hilarious.

09:08.125 --> 09:09.583
(Guests giggle)

09:09.583 --> 09:12.083
- This must be from you, Erica.

09:12.083 --> 09:14.166
- Oh, oh, actually, I, um...

09:14.166 --> 09:17.208
those, I think, are from Jenny.
- I couldn't resist.

09:17.208 --> 09:19.000
- Here, I'll uh...
I'll grab you mine.

09:20.458 --> 09:22.000
Pardon me.

09:24.125 --> 09:25.708
(Approaching footsteps)

09:25.708 --> 09:27.041
- (Excited squeal)

09:28.541 --> 09:30.750
(Sings a drum roll)

09:30.750 --> 09:32.916
- (Gasps) Erica!

09:32.916 --> 09:35.625
No, you didn't.
- I did. Of course I did.

09:35.625 --> 09:37.458
Judith, this is your first
child.

09:37.458 --> 09:39.375
- Thank you.

09:39.375 --> 09:42.375
- This is a bit awkward.

09:42.375 --> 09:44.708
- What?

09:44.708 --> 09:47.250
- We already bought the other
highchair for Judith.

09:47.250 --> 09:48.750
It's being delivered tomorrow.

09:48.750 --> 09:50.833
We know you wanted
to pay for it yourself,

09:50.833 --> 09:53.666
but it's a Godmother's right
to spoil the baby, isn't it?

09:53.666 --> 09:56.708
And especially when
there are two of us.

09:58.208 --> 09:59.750
- Uh... um...

09:59.750 --> 10:02.375
The other highchair...

10:02.375 --> 10:04.041
Yeah! It's-I mean, 'cause it's
so much more practical, right?

10:05.750 --> 10:08.625
I can totally take this back.
(Half laughs)

10:08.625 --> 10:11.791
Um... I'm just gonna see
if I uh...

10:11.791 --> 10:14.583
I just wanna make sure
I didn't throw out the receipt.

10:16.291 --> 10:18.875
(Door shuts)

10:18.875 --> 10:21.708
- Would you excuse me
for a second? Sorry.

10:21.708 --> 10:23.583
(Guests chatter quietly)

10:27.166 --> 10:29.208
(Door opens)

10:29.208 --> 10:32.416
- Hey! Where is that?

10:32.416 --> 10:33.958
- You're upset.

10:33.958 --> 10:36.416
- No, I'm fine.
I'm totally fine.

10:36.416 --> 10:38.250
- Well, you're not acting fine.

10:38.250 --> 10:39.916
- No, you know, Judith,
I, really,

10:39.916 --> 10:42.541
I think I just got a little bit
carried away at the baby store.

10:42.541 --> 10:45.791
You know, I just really,
I wanted to do something
special and...

10:45.791 --> 10:49.541
- This party is really special.
- Well, I am glad.

10:49.541 --> 10:51.791
And, you know, besides,
that other highchair,

10:51.791 --> 10:54.333
it just, it sounds way more
practical, right?

10:54.333 --> 10:56.791
And Alyson and Marie,

10:56.791 --> 10:58.791
they seem like total
Godmother material.

11:02.250 --> 11:04.333
- I put a lot of thought
into the decision

11:04.333 --> 11:06.625
and it wasn't easy.

11:06.625 --> 11:09.291
But... you know,
they've got a kid already

11:09.291 --> 11:11.083
and they're stable,
and they just get it, you know?

11:12.000 --> 11:13.958
- Totally! I mean,
that makes sense, you know?

11:13.958 --> 11:15.500
And I'm, I'm...

11:15.500 --> 11:17.916
more like the wacky
Aunt Erica, right?

11:17.916 --> 11:20.875
- Yeah. You-you lead this
incredible fun life

11:20.875 --> 11:23.625
and... you're going to be
the best wacky aunt ever.

11:25.458 --> 11:28.916
- Yes!

11:28.916 --> 11:30.583
Where is that receipt.

11:30.583 --> 11:33.125
- Yo, hostess! You forget
there's a party going on?

11:33.125 --> 11:34.541
- Yeah.

11:34.541 --> 11:35.958
(Guests chatter)

11:35.958 --> 11:37.500
- Are you okay?

11:37.500 --> 11:40.208
- I'm fine! You guys,
I'm totally fine.

11:40.208 --> 11:42.000
Go out and enjoy the guests.

11:42.000 --> 11:44.541
Um, I'm gonna grab some cake.

11:46.916 --> 11:49.500
- Jenny.
- No.

11:49.500 --> 11:51.166
Look, I'm not stupid. What's up?

11:52.708 --> 11:55.791
You look like you're gonna bawl.

11:55.791 --> 11:57.833
- I just, I... I thought
that I was the Godmother,

11:59.708 --> 12:01.291
and it turns out that
Alyson and Marie are.

12:01.291 --> 12:03.541
And I mean, it's totally,
it's not a big deal.

12:03.541 --> 12:05.500
- Judith's only known them
for a-a year.

12:05.500 --> 12:07.750
Does Anthony even know them?
I... I don't get that.

12:09.666 --> 12:12.500
- 'Kay, well, listen.
To this night ending quickly.

12:12.500 --> 12:13.958
- You know what?
If you ask me,

12:13.958 --> 12:16.583
you dodged a bullet, babe.
Mm-hmm.

12:16.583 --> 12:17.875
- Yeah.
- Come on.

12:17.875 --> 12:19.500
- Okay.

12:19.500 --> 12:21.458
- Always. Let's go.
- Let's get some cake.

12:23.000 --> 12:24.291
(Room buzzes with chatter)

12:25.750 --> 12:27.916
- All right.

12:27.916 --> 12:29.416
(Straining grunt)

12:31.916 --> 12:34.500
So who's ready for cake?
(Laughs)

12:36.083 --> 12:38.458
Um, this is, uh...
Jenny brought the cake.

12:38.458 --> 12:41.666
- Oh. Um, everyone, please,
uh, before we cake it up,

12:41.666 --> 12:43.791
I have something to say.

12:43.791 --> 12:45.500
Uh, first of all,
I want to thank you all

12:45.500 --> 12:47.500
for coming tonight. Um...

12:47.500 --> 12:49.833
and I also want to especially
thank Erica

12:49.833 --> 12:52.500
for making me a beautiful
baby shower.

12:54.083 --> 12:55.541
She's gonna be the best
wacky aunt ever,

12:57.750 --> 13:00.916
just like she's been
my best friend forever.

13:00.916 --> 13:02.916
So, to Erica.
- Wow, thanks.

13:02.916 --> 13:05.958
Guests: To Erica. Cheers.

13:05.958 --> 13:07.416

13:10.208 --> 13:11.625

- (Moans)

13:11.625 --> 13:13.500
- Jenny, are you okay? Jenny!

13:13.500 --> 13:15.041
Alyson: Did she drink too much?

13:15.041 --> 13:17.000
- (Moans) What-Where am I?

13:17.000 --> 13:18.958
Judith: Oh, we need to get her
into a cab.

13:18.958 --> 13:21.041
- No, Erica, please, please,
my car is just outside.

13:21.041 --> 13:22.791
Drive me home.
- Of course.

13:22.791 --> 13:24.791
Okay, listen,
I'm gonna take a cab back.

13:24.791 --> 13:26.916
I'll be half an hour.
- (Woozy moans)

13:26.916 --> 13:29.625
- Okay, just take your time.
Oh, here. Take your time.

13:29.625 --> 13:32.958
- Whew. I'm so-I'm so sorry.
- Are you okay?

13:32.958 --> 13:34.625
- I'm really sorry
for ruining the party.

13:34.625 --> 13:36.875
- No, no, no, it's fine, honey.

13:38.791 --> 13:40.541
(Vehicle rumbles to a stop)

13:40.541 --> 13:42.375
- Okay.

13:46.333 --> 13:48.458
Hey, Jenny, honey.

13:48.458 --> 13:49.958
It's okay, you're home.

13:49.958 --> 13:52.208
- (Groans) Oh, thank God.

13:52.208 --> 13:54.083
- So, what is it?
I mean, was it your stomach?

13:54.083 --> 13:56.458
Or are you just exhausted,
or... what?

13:56.458 --> 13:59.000
- Me, tired? Please,
the night's just begun.

13:59.000 --> 14:00.625
So we're gonna go for a drink?

14:00.625 --> 14:03.166
- Jenny?! What the hell!?

14:03.166 --> 14:04.916
Like I was gonna let you
suffer any longer.

14:04.916 --> 14:06.333
- I can't believe you.
We're going back.

14:06.333 --> 14:08.416
- No, we're not, okay?

14:08.416 --> 14:10.875
You need some time
to decompress, babe.

14:10.875 --> 14:12.625
We can't have you bawling
all over the place, okay?

14:12.625 --> 14:14.916
- Ahh! You know, with Judith,
she can...

14:14.916 --> 14:17.458
I mean, she can pick
whoever she wants.

14:17.458 --> 14:19.541
- Yes, yes, but she could've
maybe told you before tonight.

14:19.541 --> 14:21.416
It was insensitive.
Hey, don't argue.

14:23.125 --> 14:25.291
You know, sometimes I swear
Judith is a computer,

14:26.833 --> 14:28.250
a data processing automaton.

14:28.250 --> 14:29.750
- You're terrible.
- (Laughs)

14:29.750 --> 14:31.958
- Look, the thing is,
is that Alyson and Marie,

14:31.958 --> 14:33.708
I mean, they're parents.

14:33.708 --> 14:35.625
They have great jobs,
they make a lot of money.

14:35.625 --> 14:38.166
- So?
- So maybe if I were
more like them,

14:38.166 --> 14:39.708
then Judith would've picked me.

14:39.708 --> 14:42.000
- Wait. You wanna be more
like them?

14:42.000 --> 14:44.916
Wow. This calls for some
pretty serious action.

14:44.916 --> 14:48.458
I apologize in advance
for what I'm about to do.

14:48.458 --> 14:50.875

18:44.083 --> 18:45.833
the back pain melts away.

18:45.833 --> 18:47.291
Girls: (Laugh)

18:47.291 --> 18:48.750
- Why haven't we met before?

18:48.750 --> 18:50.250
- Oh, this guy's international,

18:50.250 --> 18:51.875
and thanks to my
investment planning,

18:51.875 --> 18:53.333
he has houses in, like,
four cities.

18:53.333 --> 18:55.291
- Uh, the one in London
is a flat.

18:55.291 --> 18:57.208
Who can afford a house
in London, right?

18:57.208 --> 19:00.166
- Yeah. I mean, the-the fees for
the chimney sweep alone, right?

19:00.166 --> 19:01.833
Phew!
- (Chuckles) Yeah.

19:03.333 --> 19:05.083
(Awkward silence)

19:07.333 --> 19:09.541
- (Clears throat) trust me,
don't buy the cow.

19:11.083 --> 19:12.500
Milk's free everywhere,
all right?

19:12.500 --> 19:13.958
We're outta here. Let's go.

19:13.958 --> 19:15.750
- Nice, Josh.
- Come on, let's go.

19:19.000 --> 19:21.375
- The opinions of the groom
don't necessarily reflect
the standards of the best man.

19:21.375 --> 19:24.625
- Ah, well, then I will try not
to hold your taste in friends

19:24.625 --> 19:26.833
against you.

19:26.833 --> 19:28.875
Josh: Dude, come on, let's go!
Poker!

19:30.416 --> 19:32.083
- I gotta. I'm the best man.

19:32.083 --> 19:34.250
It's my duty to be
his whipping boy.

19:34.250 --> 19:37.416
- Well, hey, just make sure
my future brother-in-law
remains a virgin.

19:37.416 --> 19:40.041
- We'll be in the VIP room
if you two ever get tired
of karaoke.

19:40.041 --> 19:41.958
- When you're tired of karaoke,
you're tired of life.

19:43.541 --> 19:45.208
(Erica's cell phone beeps)
- Wow.

19:45.208 --> 19:47.000
- Wow is right.

19:47.000 --> 19:49.333
- Oh, awesome. Two missed calls
from Judith.

19:50.958 --> 19:53.000
(Cell phone beeps,
Cell phone rings)

19:53.000 --> 19:55.375
- Excuse me.

19:55.375 --> 19:57.458
So you and Jenny
are out doing karaoke?

19:57.458 --> 19:59.750
- How did you know?
- I thought Jenny was sick.

19:59.750 --> 20:01.875
- Um, no, she's uh, she's fine.

20:01.875 --> 20:03.500
It was a, it was just
a misunderstanding, Jude.

20:03.500 --> 20:05.166
- She fainted in
your living room.

20:05.166 --> 20:07.083
- Look, I'm gonna be there
in ten minutes.

20:07.083 --> 20:09.041
I'm just hailing a cab
right now.

20:09.041 --> 20:12.291
Judith: No, just stay out.
Enjoy yourself.
- Judith.

20:12.291 --> 20:13.833
- You know what?
You're not the Godmother, fine.

20:13.833 --> 20:16.000
You get upset, whatever.

20:16.000 --> 20:17.916
But then you go and do this?

20:17.916 --> 20:20.833
God, you wonder why I chose
Alyson and Marie?

20:20.833 --> 20:23.250
- No wondering here,
not anymore. I fully get it.

20:24.708 --> 20:26.416
- (Scoffs)

20:26.416 --> 20:27.916
(Cell phone snaps off)

20:27.916 --> 20:29.333
(Cell phone beeps off)

20:29.333 --> 20:31.000
- I need a drink.

20:31.000 --> 20:33.000
- Okay, (stammers)
I know you need a drink.

20:33.000 --> 20:35.541
Let's get you one and then
you should really go and talk
to Judith.

20:35.541 --> 20:38.458
- No, I don't think so. Mm-mm.

20:38.458 --> 20:39.958
- Hey, you know what?

20:39.958 --> 20:42.125
I have always wanted to learn
how to play poker.

20:42.125 --> 20:44.958
- Erica, I-I think...

20:44.958 --> 20:46.458
You know what?
The thing is, is that I tried.

20:46.458 --> 20:48.541
But no matter what I do,
what job I have,

20:48.541 --> 20:50.291
I'm still gonna be wacky Erica.

20:50.291 --> 20:51.916
You know, the irresponsible one,

20:51.916 --> 20:53.958
the flake and... you know what?
That's fine.

20:53.958 --> 20:55.416
That's fine,
I really don't care.

20:55.416 --> 20:57.791
I'm just as happy to party
at the kids' table.

20:57.791 --> 20:59.541
(Whoosh)

20:59.541 --> 21:02.000
- Huh. Thanks for the loaner.

21:02.000 --> 21:04.000
- Well, you can keep it
because I don't need it.

21:04.000 --> 21:07.250
- Oh.

21:07.250 --> 21:09.958
So baby shower didn't go
so well, hmm?

21:13.041 --> 21:16.916
Yeah, huh... Well, let me guess.

21:16.916 --> 21:19.250
The party didn't turn out
the way you'd hoped,

21:19.250 --> 21:21.625
and now you don't want
to go back.

21:21.625 --> 21:23.333
- Just tell me, you know,
where am I going today?

21:23.333 --> 21:26.375
- Your Bat Mitzvah.
- My Bat Mitzvah? Why?

21:26.375 --> 21:28.125
- Well, because you ran away
from that party too.

21:29.708 --> 21:31.125
"And those who fail
to learn from history

21:31.125 --> 21:34.125
are doomed to repeat it."
Winston Churchill.

21:34.125 --> 21:37.166
- I'm going back to the '80s?
- You're going back
to that special Jewish,

21:37.166 --> 21:41.208
coming of age ceremony
where you left childhood
behind forever

21:41.208 --> 21:42.916
and became an adult.

21:42.916 --> 21:44.291
And so why is this a regret?

21:44.291 --> 21:47.166
- (Scoffs) My parents...

21:47.166 --> 21:49.166
they spent six months
planning my Bat Mitzvah.

21:50.916 --> 21:52.375
Band:
♪ Oh, baby, dance with me ♪

21:52.375 --> 21:54.375
Erica: I had requested
this "dirty dancing" theme,

21:54.375 --> 21:56.500
and my mom, she was a huge
Patrick Swayze fan,

21:56.500 --> 21:58.041
so she was all over it,

21:58.041 --> 22:01.125
but failed to deliver
in every way.

22:01.125 --> 22:03.958
My Bat Mitzvah, it meant a lot
to me and to my parents.

22:03.958 --> 22:06.916
And I just had this idea
about how it was gonna be

22:06.916 --> 22:08.833
and when it didn't go
according to plan,

22:08.833 --> 22:10.416
I just freaked out.

22:10.416 --> 22:11.916
You know, I felt like
everything was going wrong,

22:11.916 --> 22:14.208
and the final straw was
this kid, Cody Maxwell.

22:15.833 --> 22:17.416
Cody was the cool kid.

22:17.416 --> 22:20.125
He was the guy that everybody
wanted at their Bat Mitzvahs,

22:20.666 --> 22:23.291
and I, I don't know, somehow...

22:23.291 --> 22:25.333
he ended up calling me a Jewser.

22:25.333 --> 22:27.333
- Jewser! (Kids laughing)

22:27.333 --> 22:28.875
- A Jewser?

22:28.875 --> 22:31.208
- Yeah, it's-it's like loser,
but with Jew.

22:33.333 --> 22:35.208
- Ahh.
- Anyway, that was it.

22:36.916 --> 22:39.916
You know I had pinned all of
my hopes on this day and...

22:41.000 --> 22:43.333
it-it-it felt like such
a huge failure,

22:43.333 --> 22:45.791
so I was a huge failure,
and I...

22:47.333 --> 22:49.250
I bailed on the whole thing.

22:49.250 --> 22:52.291
I stormed out and spent
the evening in the car, crying.

22:52.291 --> 22:54.458
My parents were devastated.

22:54.458 --> 22:57.583
They got into a huge fight all
because of my silly freak out.

22:57.583 --> 22:59.166
- And what would you
do differently?

22:59.166 --> 23:01.250
- I would stay. I would hang
with my parents, and...

23:03.333 --> 23:05.666
and Leo and Sammy,

23:05.666 --> 23:07.208
and I would dance
with my friends

23:07.208 --> 23:09.250
and just enjoy it
for what it is,

23:10.916 --> 23:12.916
instead of making it
into something that it isn't.

23:14.458 --> 23:17.500

23:55.458 --> 23:57.541

someone commit social suicide.

26:46.416 --> 26:48.791
- Come on, Jenny,
it was hilarious.

26:48.791 --> 26:51.375
- Do you realize Cody Maxwell
is here?

26:51.375 --> 26:53.375
I heard last weekend that he
actually kissed that skeezer,

26:53.375 --> 26:55.833
Carly Rosenfeld,
and you're way cuter than her.

26:55.833 --> 26:58.250
So I totally thought
he was gonna kiss you.

26:58.250 --> 27:00.250
But now? No way.

27:00.250 --> 27:03.041
- This Bat Mitzvah is shit.

27:03.041 --> 27:05.750
Can't believe I chose this one
over Rachel Epstein's.

27:05.750 --> 27:08.166
- You can always leave.
That's an option.

27:08.166 --> 27:10.000
- Yeah, I think maybe I will.

27:10.000 --> 27:12.708
Hey, Barry, what do you call
a loser at her Bat Mitzvah?

27:12.708 --> 27:16.041
A Jewser.
(Children laugh)

27:16.041 --> 27:18.625
- You know, Cody, not to be
condescending and all,

27:18.625 --> 27:21.791
but all this judging
of people... not so nice.

27:21.791 --> 27:23.375
Especially considering the fact
that you're a bed wetter.

27:25.666 --> 27:27.666
You're thinking,
how does she know?

27:27.666 --> 27:29.750
Not gonna bore you with details,

27:29.750 --> 27:31.833
but after the class trip
to Ottawa next year,

27:31.833 --> 27:34.208
everyone will know,

brought my guitar.

you nailin' that little bastard

That deserves a cocktail,
don't you think?

- I cannot serve alcohol
to minors.

28:59.250 --> 29:01.458
You heard your father.
- The fact that I'm a child
is a technicality.

29:01.458 --> 29:04.583
- Do you know who was
a really remarkable child?

29:04.583 --> 29:06.750
Shirley Temple.
- (Sighs)

29:09.250 --> 29:12.583

29:40.625 --> 29:43.583
- Come with me, sweetheart.
- What's wrong?

29:43.583 --> 29:45.958
- I just wanna have
a little chat with you.

29:45.958 --> 29:47.458
♪ So come with me ♪

29:49.833 --> 29:51.916
♪ 'Cause we're meant to be... ♪

29:53.541 --> 29:55.291
- And you know, honey,
in the next little while

29:56.875 --> 29:58.583
your body is gonna start
to change too.

30:00.041 --> 30:01.625
So many changes.

30:01.625 --> 30:03.333
- Mom, can we not talk
about this right now?

30:03.333 --> 30:05.041
- Of course, I'm sorry.

30:05.041 --> 30:06.916
I don't want to embarrass you
in front of your friends.

30:06.916 --> 30:09.666
It's just...
(Inhales and exhales)

30:09.666 --> 30:12.416
I look at this face
and I see my little baby.

30:16.791 --> 30:19.708
Before you know it,
I'll be walking down the aisle,

30:19.708 --> 30:21.750
playing with my grandchildren,

30:21.750 --> 30:24.416
visiting you at the firm.

30:24.416 --> 30:27.083
- The firm?
- The law firm.

30:27.083 --> 30:28.666
Don't you still want
to be a lawyer?

30:28.666 --> 30:30.958
- Right, a lawyer.

30:30.958 --> 30:33.375
Wow, I forgot all about
that little phase.

30:35.875 --> 30:38.666
I mean... yeah,
that could happen.

30:38.666 --> 30:40.708
But it's also possible
I won't get married right away.

30:42.708 --> 30:45.166
I might be thirty
and still single.

30:45.166 --> 30:46.916
- Oh, sweetheart, don't worry,
that's not gonna happen.

30:48.750 --> 30:50.958
By thirty, you'll have two kids
and a husband, trust me.

30:50.958 --> 30:52.750
- But what if I don't?

30:52.750 --> 30:54.625
What if I'm not a lawyer?

30:54.625 --> 30:56.083
What if at thirty,
I'm still single

30:56.083 --> 30:57.875
and living in a one-bedroom
apartment

30:57.875 --> 30:59.666
and working as someone's
assistant?

30:59.666 --> 31:02.416
- Erica, that's not gonna
happen,

31:02.416 --> 31:06.541
living like that,
like some bum, at thirty.

31:06.541 --> 31:08.416
That's not you.

31:10.583 --> 31:13.583
Now stop thinking
such terrible thoughts.

31:13.583 --> 31:15.750
Go. Be with your friends.

31:17.750 --> 31:19.041
(Kiss) I love you.

31:20.750 --> 31:22.875
Thank you.
- Oh, that was...

31:22.875 --> 31:24.416
That was mine. That's fine.
- Too bad.

31:24.416 --> 31:26.333
(Door opens)

31:30.916 --> 31:32.416
- (Sighs heavily)

31:38.875 --> 31:40.750
(Man whistling, door opens)

31:40.750 --> 31:42.666
(Cart rattles)

31:44.375 --> 31:46.625
- Hey.

31:46.625 --> 31:48.500
Party's that way.
- I need a minute.

31:48.500 --> 31:50.666
- Oh.

31:50.666 --> 31:53.666
I think it's a shame that you're
not enjoying your Bat Mitzvah.

31:53.666 --> 31:55.458
It is a once-in-a-lifetime
event.

31:57.041 --> 31:59.125
- Twice, if you're me.
- That's true.

31:59.125 --> 32:01.000
- Why do I even care?

32:01.000 --> 32:04.125
I mean, what's the point
of doing this again?

32:04.125 --> 32:06.625
It's not like I'm gonna
reach adulthood anyway,

32:06.625 --> 32:08.833
at least not according
to how my mom defines it.

32:08.833 --> 32:11.750
- Well, you know then, why not
just try being who you are?

32:11.750 --> 32:13.666
Hey! How 'bout that?

32:13.666 --> 32:15.791
- I'm not even sure
I know who I am.

32:15.791 --> 32:17.958
- Well, that's not true.
You're Erica Strange.

32:17.958 --> 32:19.833
Friend, daughter, crazy aunt,

32:19.833 --> 32:21.833
Bat Mitzvah honoree.

32:21.833 --> 32:24.583
- Bat Mitzvah honoree.
Yeah, right.

32:27.875 --> 32:29.333
- You know what it's like,
Erica?

32:29.333 --> 32:33.083
It's like...it's like you
are in a boat,

32:33.083 --> 32:34.625
you've got this one oar
over here

32:34.625 --> 32:36.375
and it is just rowing
and rowing and rowing.

32:36.375 --> 32:40.708
You know, furiously fueled by
everyone else's expectations.

32:40.708 --> 32:42.166
And that's...
that's never gonna stop,

32:42.166 --> 32:45.166
but it's kind of got you
going around in circles.

32:45.166 --> 32:46.958
'Cause if you want
to move forward,

32:46.958 --> 32:49.291
then you also have to row
with the oar

32:49.291 --> 32:52.083
that represents
how you see yourself.

32:54.625 --> 32:56.416
Hmm.

32:56.416 --> 32:58.791
(Cart rattles)

32:58.791 --> 33:01.875
"Learn to be what you are

33:01.875 --> 33:03.625
and learn to resign
with good grace

33:03.625 --> 33:06.833
all that you are not."

33:06.833 --> 33:08.416
Henri Frederique Amile.

33:09.875 --> 33:11.416
(Door opens)

33:19.041 --> 33:21.625
(Low hum of chatter)

33:25.666 --> 33:27.583
- Like, oh my God,
the band is packing up,

33:27.583 --> 33:28.958
and Cody Maxwell
is dragging everyone

33:28.958 --> 33:30.458
to Rachel Epstein's
Bat Mitzvah.

33:30.458 --> 33:32.666
- Why is the band packing up?
It's only eight o'clock.

33:32.666 --> 33:34.083
- Did you not hear what I said?

33:34.083 --> 33:36.250
- Don't move.

33:36.250 --> 33:38.333
- If you'd just listened to me,
none of this would've happened.

33:38.333 --> 33:40.333
- Why is the band stopping?
People still wanna dance.

33:40.333 --> 33:42.375
- Because we just hired them
for a certain amount of time.

33:42.375 --> 33:44.375
- Well, could we offer them
more money to stay?

33:44.375 --> 33:47.333
- Well, the thing, sweetie,
is that there isn't more money.

33:47.333 --> 33:49.750
- Oh, please, Gary,
I told you not to discuss this
in front of the kids.

33:49.750 --> 33:53.208
- We should've hired a DJ.
It would've been a lot cheaper
than hiring a stupid band.

33:53.208 --> 33:54.875
- Oh, okay,
so then it's my fault?

33:54.875 --> 33:56.333
- A band, DJ?
Honestly, I don't care.

33:56.333 --> 33:58.958
- You see? She doesn't care.
- I just want it to be
a good time.

33:58.958 --> 34:00.541
So why didn't we just hire Leo
and his guitar?

34:00.541 --> 34:02.666
- Oh, Gary, don't be ridiculous.

34:02.666 --> 34:04.166
Leo: (Strumming guitar)
- Come on.

34:04.166 --> 34:06.750
- Whoa-ho-ho. Whoa.
What're we doing?

34:06.750 --> 34:08.791
- You want to jam, right?
- No way.

34:08.791 --> 34:10.916
- Way.
- Um... what're we playing?

34:12.958 --> 34:14.708
(Mic thumps
and feedback squeals)

34:14.708 --> 34:17.750
- Uh, hi.

34:17.750 --> 34:20.708
You're probably wondering why
the band has packed up so early.

34:20.708 --> 34:23.750
Well, my parents wanted them
to play all night,

34:23.750 --> 34:26.166
but I wanted to try something
a little different.

34:26.166 --> 34:28.375
But first I want
to thank my parents

34:28.375 --> 34:30.541
for throwing me
the best Bat Mitzvah ever.

36:12.208 --> 36:15.291
- 13 years ago... (Welling up)

36:17.333 --> 36:19.208
- 13 years ago, my wife
gave me a great gift.

36:22.875 --> 36:25.458
A girl.

36:25.458 --> 36:29.083
- A girl who has your tenacity.

36:29.083 --> 36:31.250
- And your tempestuousness.

36:32.791 --> 36:35.958
- And your wit.

36:35.958 --> 36:38.041
- And your compassion.

36:41.333 --> 36:43.166
And today we celebrate together

36:43.166 --> 36:46.083
as that girl becomes a woman.

37:02.083 --> 37:04.250
- (Mouths) Thank you.

37:08.375 --> 37:11.083
(Rock music plays)
- Ah. (Exhales)

37:11.083 --> 37:14.041
Ryan: Hey, girls.
Glad you changed your mind.

37:14.041 --> 37:16.208
- If they want to stay,
this becomes strip poker.

37:16.208 --> 37:18.083
Off with the shirts!

37:18.083 --> 37:19.958
That includes you, Jennifer.
- I'm in.

37:19.958 --> 37:22.375
- Um, I'm out. I mean,
I'm gonna-I'm leaving.

37:22.375 --> 37:25.083
- What? You just said--
- I know. I changed my mind
though, so.

37:25.083 --> 37:27.875
- And I can't change it back?

37:27.875 --> 37:31.000
- Um... Wow. Trust me,
under normal circumstances

37:31.000 --> 37:33.166
you-you most definitely could,

37:33.166 --> 37:34.916
but there's somewhere
that I really need to be.

37:34.916 --> 37:36.375
- Okay, well, what's the
forecast for tomorrow then?

37:36.375 --> 37:38.541
Because if that calls
for normal circumstances,

37:38.541 --> 37:40.541
I'd love to take you out
for dinner.

37:40.541 --> 37:42.250
- That would be great. Yeah.

37:42.250 --> 37:45.000
Um, do you want a...
a phone number or email or...?

37:45.000 --> 37:46.666
- You know what?
You're in a rush right now,

37:46.666 --> 37:47.875
so don't worry,
I'll figure it out.

37:47.875 --> 37:49.708
Torture Josh if I have to.

37:51.291 --> 37:53.416
- Okay. Please do.
(Receding footsteps)

37:56.750 --> 37:59.125
(Hurried footsteps)

37:59.125 --> 38:01.000
Hi. Good night. Thanks.
Good night!

38:01.000 --> 38:03.416
- Oh, Judith, thank God,
you're still here.

38:03.416 --> 38:05.375
Please, please, please,
just hear me out.

38:05.375 --> 38:07.041
- Alyson and Marie are waiting
for me downstairs.

38:07.041 --> 38:09.208
- I know, just I'm sorry
that I took off on you.

38:09.208 --> 38:11.583
And Jenny and I with karaoke,
it was just stupid.

38:11.583 --> 38:14.041
- Whatever. I don't care, okay?

38:14.041 --> 38:15.500
I really don't.

38:15.500 --> 38:17.416
- Judith.

38:17.416 --> 38:18.750
Jude, please.

38:21.208 --> 38:22.791
(Sighs heavily)

38:26.250 --> 38:28.000
- Hey, it's me again.

38:28.000 --> 38:29.958
Uh...

38:29.958 --> 38:33.041
I'm just, I'm calling
to apologize.

38:33.041 --> 38:35.500
Jude, please call me back.

38:35.500 --> 38:37.166
(Knock at door, phone beeps off)

38:37.166 --> 38:39.125
Judith?

38:39.125 --> 38:40.458
(Door opens)

38:41.958 --> 38:43.458
- I brought your book back.

38:43.458 --> 38:44.750
- Thanks, it'll make great
kindling.

38:44.750 --> 38:46.166
- No, it was a good read.

38:46.166 --> 38:47.708
Yeah. But I'm not the Godmother

38:47.708 --> 38:49.416
and I sure as hell don't wanna
be the wacky aunt.

38:49.416 --> 38:51.125
- Who says you have
to be either?

38:51.125 --> 38:53.375
E. E. Cummings said, "It takes
a lot of courage to grow up

38:53.375 --> 38:56.541
and be who you really are."

38:56.541 --> 38:58.166
- Good night.

39:02.166 --> 39:04.250
(Door and latch click shut)

39:14.166 --> 39:15.916
- (Yelling) Judith!

39:15.916 --> 39:17.833
(Doorbell dings)

39:17.833 --> 39:19.916
(Raps on door)

39:21.375 --> 39:23.500
(Doorbell dings)

39:26.041 --> 39:28.583
Hey, Jude!

39:28.583 --> 39:30.500
Okay, I'm going around
to the back!

39:31.916 --> 39:33.291
Judith!

39:35.041 --> 39:36.958
Mrs. Winters!

39:38.541 --> 39:39.958
Come on, Judith,
I know you're in there.

39:39.958 --> 39:43.000
I'm not leaving
until you come out.

39:43.000 --> 39:44.958
(Door creaks opens)

39:49.375 --> 39:51.333
Hey.

39:58.166 --> 39:59.541
- You walked out
on my baby shower.

39:59.541 --> 40:01.041
- I know.

40:01.041 --> 40:03.208
I was wrong, and... (sighs)

40:05.666 --> 40:07.625
- Look, the whole Godmother
thing, okay--

40:07.625 --> 40:09.458
- Alyson and Marie, they were
the right choice, Jude.

40:09.458 --> 40:10.833
I get it.

40:12.500 --> 40:15.208
- I picked them because they've
been through this before...

40:17.291 --> 40:19.541
and I haven't... (clears throat)

40:19.541 --> 40:22.083
and I'm terrified.

40:22.083 --> 40:24.166
And maybe it was insensitive,
okay? And a mistake--

40:24.166 --> 40:26.000
- No, it wasn't. (Sighs)
It wasn't.

40:28.625 --> 40:31.291
- The whole time you were gone,
they kept talking about, uh,

40:31.291 --> 40:33.916
egg yolk baby poop.
- Yeah. It's newborn poop.

40:34.000 --> 40:36.375
It's like uh... egg yolk,
but it smells like popcorn.

40:38.583 --> 40:40.875
- Oh my God. (Laughs)

40:40.875 --> 40:43.250
I am not handling this. How do
you even know about that?

40:43.250 --> 40:45.125
- I did some research, you know,

40:45.125 --> 40:48.208
when I thought that I was
gonna be the... whatever.

40:48.208 --> 40:50.291
- Oh... God, I feel terrible.

40:50.291 --> 40:53.000
- Don't, don't. Hey, listen.
You made the right choice.

40:54.958 --> 40:57.416
You did the right thing.

40:57.416 --> 40:59.583
And I'm gonna...
I'm gonna babysit.

40:59.583 --> 41:01.875
I'm gonna spoil your kid rotten.

41:01.875 --> 41:05.666
I am gonna bring you casseroles
when you aren't sleeping,

41:05.666 --> 41:08.541
and do everything
that I can to help you.

41:08.541 --> 41:10.916
'Cause Godmother or not,
I'm still your best friend.

41:15.625 --> 41:18.791
And... surprise!

41:18.791 --> 41:22.500
- What's this?
- It's the last thing
on your registry.

41:22.500 --> 41:24.291
(Mimics drum roll)

41:24.291 --> 41:26.458
The diaper eater!

41:26.458 --> 41:29.208
Probably the least flashy thing
that you could get,

41:29.208 --> 41:31.541
but it's practical.

41:31.541 --> 41:33.625
- And every time I use it,
I will think of you.

41:35.125 --> 41:37.500
- Mm...

41:37.500 --> 41:39.000
Thanks. (Laughs)

41:40.500 --> 41:41.791
- No, thank you.

41:43.458 --> 41:47.291
- There comes a point
when you realize truth is this:

41:47.291 --> 41:50.666
being grown up is simply
knowing who you are

41:50.666 --> 41:53.375
and having the courage
to be that person,

41:53.375 --> 41:55.583
warts and all.

41:59.166 --> 42:01.083
(Vehicle whirs by)

42:03.541 --> 42:05.125
(Door opens)

42:05.125 --> 42:07.208
- Hey, you.
- Erica.

42:07.208 --> 42:09.625
- I see you're back
from Montreal in one piece.

42:09.625 --> 42:11.750
- I am.
- So? How did it go?

42:11.750 --> 42:14.416
- Oh, better than it should
have, actually.

42:14.416 --> 42:17.291
- Wow. That-that's surprising.

42:18.791 --> 42:21.000
(Approaching footsteps)

42:21.000 --> 42:22.958
- Ryan!

42:24.833 --> 42:27.333
- Okay, um, well... look, I'll
talk to you later, all right?

42:27.333 --> 42:28.708
- Yeah, I'll talk to you later.

42:28.708 --> 42:30.000
- Hi.
- Hey.

42:31.500 --> 42:34.333
- You're early.
- I know.

42:34.333 --> 42:36.333
I am early. Half an hour early.

42:36.333 --> 42:38.166
And I know that may seem
creepy, but...
- (Laughs)

42:38.166 --> 42:40.250
- I just like showing up
early for things.

42:40.250 --> 42:43.000
- That's okay. I was gonna
change into something nicer, so.

42:44.541 --> 42:46.041
- You look great.
- Thank you.

42:47.708 --> 42:49.708
Uh, do you wanna, do you wanna
come in for a second?

42:49.708 --> 42:52.666
I've got lots of elderberry
juice leftover from last night.

42:52.666 --> 42:54.708
- Elderberry?
- It's actually quite good.

42:54.708 --> 42:56.791
- I'll trust you on that one.

42:56.791 --> 42:58.250
And why do you have
elderberry juice?

42:58.250 --> 42:59.708
- Don't ask.

43:04.250 --> 43:05.541
(Door creaks shut)
