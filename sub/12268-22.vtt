WEBVTT

00:00.671 --> 00:01.772
PREVIOUSLY ON "REVENGE"...

00:01.772 --> 00:03.074
THERE'S ONE MORE THING
I MUST ASK OF YOU.

00:03.074 --> 00:05.005
THE DEAL WAS FOR CARRION.
 TAKE A SEAT.

00:05.005 --> 00:06.237
(switch clicks, clank)

00:06.237 --> 00:07.408
(Declan) IT'S A BLACKOUT.

00:07.408 --> 00:08.609
THE FALC0N MUST HAVE ALTERED
CARRION SO THAT

00:08.609 --> 00:11.182
WHEN WE HACKED
THE AMANDA CLARKE FOUNDATION--

00:11.182 --> 00:12.283
IT TRIGGERED
THE CHAIN REACTION.

00:12.283 --> 00:14.585
STEER CLEAR
OF GRAYSON GLOBAL TODAY.

00:14.585 --> 00:16.487
YOU THINK THIS IS
THE INITIATIVE, DON'T YOU?

00:16.487 --> 00:18.789
34 MORE LETTERS.

00:18.789 --> 00:21.152
WHAT ARE THE CHANCES
YOUR REAL SON IS IN THIS MIX?

00:21.152 --> 00:22.153
MY MOTHER TOLD ME
ABOUT THE BABY.

00:22.153 --> 00:23.794
I just wanna see you.

00:23.794 --> 00:26.157
JACK PORTER KNOWS WHAT HAPPENED
ON THE "AMANDA."

00:26.157 --> 00:27.798
HE'S GOING TO SABOTAGE
YOUR PRESS CONFERENCE.

00:27.798 --> 00:30.331
I'LL SIMPLY INSTRUCT ASHLEY
THAT HE'S BARRED FROM THE GATES.

00:30.331 --> 00:32.232
SHE'S IN IT WITH HIM,
YOU FOOL.

00:32.232 --> 00:34.365
HE WASN'T AT GRAYSON GLOBAL
TO FIX THEIR SERVERS.

00:34.365 --> 00:36.267
HE WAS ONLY THERE
TO GAIN ACCESS.

00:36.267 --> 00:37.408
JACK, DO NOT GO
INTO GRAYSON GLOBAL.

00:37.408 --> 00:40.071
YOU--YOU ARE BEING SET UP.

00:40.071 --> 00:41.372
(explosion)

00:41.372 --> 00:42.743
(screaming)

00:42.743 --> 00:44.345
(gasps) JACK.

00:52.183 --> 00:54.355
(clanks)

00:54.355 --> 00:58.389
(people shouting indistinctly,
car alarm wailing)

01:02.663 --> 01:05.336
(panting)

01:05.336 --> 01:07.368
EMILY! EMS!

01:07.368 --> 01:09.340
STOP!
YOU CAN'T GO IN THERE.

01:09.340 --> 01:11.142
I HAVE TO.
JACK'S INSIDE.

01:11.142 --> 01:12.803
YEAH, BUT IF HE DIDN'T
GET MY MESSAGE--
 DID YOU TRACK HIS PHONE?

01:12.803 --> 01:15.306
I HAVE TO GO TO THE OFFICE
TO CHECK NolSat.
 THEN DO IT.

01:15.306 --> 01:16.407
WAIT. WAIT.

01:16.407 --> 01:17.548
THE GRAYSONS.

01:17.548 --> 01:19.280
I'LL FIND ANOTHER WAY IN.
GO.

01:19.280 --> 01:21.312
(indistinct shouting continues)

01:21.312 --> 01:23.083
THANK GOD YOUR PHONE IS WORKING.
WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON?

01:23.083 --> 01:24.255
(Nolan) The Initiative

01:24.255 --> 01:26.317
JUST BLEW GRAYSON GLOBAL
TO KINGDOM COME.

01:26.317 --> 01:28.219
WHERE IS EMILY?
I CAN'T GET HOLD OF HER.
 Somebody tried

01:28.219 --> 01:29.520
TO LURE JACK PORTER
INTO THE OFFICE

01:29.520 --> 01:30.861
JUST BEFORE THE BLAST.

01:30.861 --> 01:32.393
She went in to look
for him.

01:32.393 --> 01:34.865
SHE WHAT? I-I--
I'M COMING DOWN THERE.

01:34.865 --> 01:36.527
(man) NO! JUST KEEP MOVING!
 NO! AIDEN.

01:36.527 --> 01:39.270
THEY WILL TRY AND PIN THIS
ON YOU, TOO.

01:39.270 --> 01:41.272
You have to stay a--
 (beep)

01:41.272 --> 01:43.734
AIDEN?
 (woman) LET'S GET OUTTA HERE!

01:43.734 --> 01:45.406
ALL RIGHT,
KEEP THOSE PEOPLE BACK

01:45.406 --> 01:47.138
BECAUSE DEBRIS IS STILL FALLING!

01:47.138 --> 01:51.242
WE NEED VOLUNTEERS TO HELP
FORM A SEARCH-AND-RESCUE SQUAD.

01:51.242 --> 01:53.414
SHOULDN'T WE WAIT
FOR FIRST RESPONDERS?

01:53.414 --> 01:55.386
WE ARE THE FIRST RESPONDERS.

01:55.386 --> 01:58.249
(siren wailing in distance)
 NOW ORGANIZE A TEAM
TO START CALLING

01:58.249 --> 01:59.620
OUR GRAYSON GLOBAL
FAMILY AND FRIENDS.

01:59.620 --> 02:02.122
WE DON'T REST UNTIL EVERYONE
IS ACCOUNTED FOR.

02:02.122 --> 02:04.625
MR. GRAYSON, ANY THEORIES
AS TO WHAT JUST HAPPENED?

02:04.625 --> 02:05.796
DO YOU THINK YOU WERE
A TARGET?

02:05.796 --> 02:07.158
OH, I'M NOT
GONNA SPECULATE.

02:07.158 --> 02:08.699
MY FOCUS IS SOLELY
ON THE INJURED.

02:08.699 --> 02:11.362
(siren wailing)
 I WILL SAY THAT I
THANK PROVIDENCE THAT MY SON

02:11.362 --> 02:13.164
HAD THE GOOD FORTUNE TO SEND
ALL OF HIS EMPLOYEES HOME

02:13.164 --> 02:14.435
THIS MORNING.

02:14.435 --> 02:17.168
THANK YOU. THAT'S ALL
I HAVE TO SAY, PEOPLE.

02:17.168 --> 02:18.439
(horn blares)

02:18.439 --> 02:20.911
(camera shutter clicks)
 HAVE YOU HEARD FROM EMILY?

02:20.911 --> 02:24.345
(indistinct conversations)

02:24.345 --> 02:25.576
(line rings, click)

02:25.576 --> 02:27.678
This is Emily.
 Leave a message.

02:27.678 --> 02:30.251
(beeps)

02:30.251 --> 02:31.552
(coughs)

02:31.552 --> 02:33.254
JACK?

02:33.254 --> 02:34.425
(pops)

02:34.425 --> 02:35.626
JACK, CAN YOU HEAR ME?

02:35.626 --> 02:38.158
(pops and hisses)

02:39.730 --> 02:42.263
JACK, ARE YOU IN HERE?!

02:42.263 --> 02:44.595
(panting)

02:44.595 --> 02:47.238
JACK, ARE YOU IN HERE?!

02:49.870 --> 02:51.402
(crackles)

02:51.402 --> 02:53.474
(muffled cry)

02:53.474 --> 02:55.276
JACK.
 (clatters)

02:55.276 --> 02:57.278
(crashes)
 JACK!

02:57.278 --> 02:58.609
(crackles)
 WAIT. THERE'S--
THERE'S SOMEBODY IN THERE.

02:58.609 --> 02:59.850
MISS, JUST CALM DOWN.

02:59.850 --> 03:01.212
NO, THERE'S SOMEBODY IN THERE!

03:01.212 --> 03:02.383
WE GOT IT. WE GOT IT.

03:02.383 --> 03:04.485
CAMPBELL,
TAKE HER TO SAFETY. GO.

03:04.485 --> 03:06.357
JACK!
 BE CAREFUL.

03:06.357 --> 03:07.618
JACK!

03:07.618 --> 03:10.291
(speaks indistinctly)

03:10.291 --> 03:12.393
(pants)

03:12.393 --> 03:14.225
JACK.

03:14.225 --> 03:16.697
COME ON, BUDDY.
PLEASE BE OKAY.

03:16.697 --> 03:18.299
(typing)

03:18.299 --> 03:19.830
(siren wailing in distance)

03:19.830 --> 03:21.372
COME ON, COME ON,
COME ON,

03:21.372 --> 03:22.503
COME ON, COME ON, COME ON.
 (beep)

03:22.503 --> 03:23.704
WHAT?

03:23.704 --> 03:25.236
10 FEET AWAY? WHAT?

03:25.236 --> 03:26.407
I GOT YOUR MESSAGE.

03:26.407 --> 03:27.678
(sighs)

03:27.678 --> 03:30.441
OH, JACK. THANK GOD.

03:30.441 --> 03:32.883
(grunts)
 NOT SO FAST, FRIEND.

03:32.883 --> 03:35.386
HOW THE HELL'D YOU KNOW
THAT BUILDING WAS GONNA EXPLODE?

03:35.386 --> 03:47.428
(panting)

03:52.563 --> 03:53.734
WHATEVER COMES OUT
OF YOUR MOUTH NEXT

03:53.734 --> 03:55.736
BETTER BE THE TRUTH,
NOLAN.

03:55.736 --> 03:57.808
LOOK, IT STARTED WHEN
VICTORIA ASKED ME

03:57.808 --> 03:59.670
TO HELP HER TRACK DOWN
HER FIRSTBORN SON.

03:59.670 --> 04:00.841
OH, COME ON.

04:00.841 --> 04:02.913
JACK, BEAR WITH ME.

04:02.913 --> 04:06.417
YEARS AGO, SHE HIRED
A HACKER NAMED THE FALC0N

04:06.417 --> 04:08.949
TO DIGITALLY OBLITERATE
ALL TRACES OF HER SON.

04:08.949 --> 04:10.621
ONCE I GOT
ONTO THE FALC0N'S TRAIL,

04:10.621 --> 04:13.023
I STUMBLED ON TO
THE ANGRY BIRD'S LATEST GIG

04:13.023 --> 04:15.586
WORKING FOR
A BUNCH OF TERRORISTS.

04:15.586 --> 04:16.726
THE ONES RESPONSIBLE
FOR THE BLACKOUT?

04:16.726 --> 04:18.728
AND THE DOWNING
OF FLIGHT 197

04:18.728 --> 04:20.991
THAT GOT BLAMED
ON DAVID CLARKE.

04:20.991 --> 04:24.695
NOW MY GUESS IS THERE WAS
EVIDENCE ON AMANDA'S COMPUTER

04:24.695 --> 04:26.967
THAT RELATED TO THAT.

04:26.967 --> 04:28.969
WHO WERE YOU
SUPPOSED TO GO MEET?

04:28.969 --> 04:30.371
ASHLEY.

04:30.371 --> 04:31.602
(exhales)

04:31.602 --> 04:33.474
SHE TEXTED ME.

04:35.306 --> 04:37.448
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

04:37.448 --> 04:39.009
(exhales) TO GET THE TRUTH.

04:39.009 --> 04:41.051
JACK...
 (siren wailing in distance)

04:41.051 --> 04:43.454
CONRAD JUST TRIED
TO MURDER YOU.

04:43.454 --> 04:47.588
IF YOU GO ANYWHERE NEAR HIM,
HE WILL FINISH THE JOB!

04:47.588 --> 04:51.492
NOT IF HE THINKS
HE ALREADY DID.

04:51.492 --> 04:52.763
(thuds, shatters)

04:52.763 --> 04:53.864
(indistinct conversations)

04:53.864 --> 04:55.025
I'M FINE.

04:55.025 --> 04:56.567
GOT HER.

04:56.567 --> 04:58.669
EMILY, OH, MY GOD.
YOU'RE HURT.
 NO.

04:58.669 --> 04:59.970
ARE YOU OKAY?
 NO, I'M FINE.
REALLY, I'M OKAY.

04:59.970 --> 05:01.502
WHAT WERE YOU DOING
IN THERE?

05:01.502 --> 05:03.934
(panting) LOOKING FOR YOU.

05:03.934 --> 05:06.677
YOU'RE CRAZY,
YOU KNOW THAT?

05:06.677 --> 05:07.778
I'M SO SORRY.

05:07.778 --> 05:09.640
I-I THINK I SHOULD
GET THIS CHECKED OUT.

05:09.640 --> 05:10.811
(man) YOU WANNA HELP ME OUT?
 YEAH, YOU WANT ME
TO GO WITH YOU?

05:10.811 --> 05:12.042
NO, NO, NO, PLEASE,
THESE PEOPLE NEED HELP.

05:12.042 --> 05:13.384
DANIEL!
 (Emily) HONESTLY.

05:13.384 --> 05:14.845
YOU SURE?
 GO. JUST GO.

05:14.845 --> 05:16.687
YOU SURE? YOU'RE OKAY?

05:16.687 --> 05:18.789
I'M FINE. (panting)

05:18.789 --> 05:19.950
(cell phone keypad beeps)

05:19.950 --> 05:21.722
(line rings)
 (man) I NEED YOU TO WALK.

05:21.722 --> 05:23.554
(ring, line clicks)

05:23.554 --> 05:24.595
(Nolan) Ems.

05:24.595 --> 05:26.597
I'VE BEEN TRYING TO REACH YOU.

05:26.597 --> 05:27.898
NOLAN, TELL ME
THAT JACK'S OKAY.

05:27.898 --> 05:29.730
THERE WAS A MAN TRAPPED
ON THE 27th FLOOR.

05:29.730 --> 05:31.402
IT'S OKAY. HE'S FINE.

05:31.402 --> 05:32.563
OH, THANK GOD.

05:32.563 --> 05:33.864
He got my message in time,

05:33.864 --> 05:36.467
but now we've got
a bigger problem.

05:36.467 --> 05:37.968
HE KNOWS THAT CONRAD
WAS TRYING TO KILL HIM,

05:37.968 --> 05:40.811
AND NOW HE'S OUT
DIGGING FOR ANSWERS,

05:40.811 --> 05:42.643
STARTING WITH ASHLEY.

05:42.643 --> 05:43.744
ASHLEY?

05:43.744 --> 05:45.476
She was the one
who sent him the text

05:45.476 --> 05:46.817
to rendezvous
at Grayson Global.

05:46.817 --> 05:49.349
EMS, WE HAVE TO STOP HIM
BEFORE HE DOES SOMETHING STUPID.

05:49.349 --> 05:50.821
NO, HE'S NOT GONNA TAKE
MY CALLS, NOLAN.

05:50.821 --> 05:52.483
BECAUSE HE WON'T TAKE
ANYBODY'S CALLS.

05:52.483 --> 05:53.954
HE DESTROYED HIS PHONE

05:53.954 --> 05:55.456
so no one could track him.

05:55.456 --> 05:57.357
I am telling you,
he is out for blood.

05:57.357 --> 05:59.730
DAMN IT. (panting)
 (beep)

05:59.730 --> 06:01.031
WE ARE THE FIRST RESPONDERS.

06:01.031 --> 06:02.733
CELL SUBSCRIBERS
 IN THE TRISTATE AREA...

06:02.733 --> 06:04.034
NO, WE'RE JUST GLAD
THAT YOU'RE SAFE, GRACE.

06:04.034 --> 06:05.566
THE TEXT "LONG LIVE
 DAVID CLARKE"...

06:05.566 --> 06:07.868
NO, THE COMPANY WILL BE CLOSED
UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE.

06:07.868 --> 06:08.999
WE'LL BE IN TOUCH.

06:08.999 --> 06:10.601
OKAY, BYE.
 (beep)

06:10.601 --> 06:12.603
(muffled grunt)

06:12.603 --> 06:13.744
WHEN I TAKE MY HAND
OFF YOUR MOUTH,

06:13.744 --> 06:15.776
YOU DON'T MAKE A SOUND,
YOU UNDERSTAND?

06:17.808 --> 06:19.980
(breathes heavily)

06:19.980 --> 06:21.812
I KNOW YOU SET ME UP.

06:21.812 --> 06:23.383
SET YOU UP FOR WHAT?

06:23.383 --> 06:24.785
YOU TEXTED ME TO MEET YOU
AT GRAYSON GLOBAL.

06:24.785 --> 06:26.417
(slaps wall)
 I WAS IN THE BUILDING
WHEN IT EXPLODED.

06:26.417 --> 06:27.718
I DIDN'T TEXT YOU.

06:27.718 --> 06:30.821
I SWEAR. LOOK.

06:30.821 --> 06:32.693
HOW DO I KNOW YOU DIDN'T
JUST DELETE THE TEXT?

06:32.693 --> 06:34.124
JACK, I DIDN'T TEXT YOU.

06:34.124 --> 06:36.627
WHAT DID IT SAY?

06:36.627 --> 06:38.128
THAT YOU HAD THE COMPUTER

06:38.128 --> 06:39.800
VICTORIA WAS PRETENDING
TO HELP ME FIND.

06:39.800 --> 06:42.533
SHE MUST HAVE TOLD CONRAD
THAT YOU WERE ON TO HIM.

06:42.533 --> 06:45.636
AND THEN HE USED IT
TO LURE ME INTO THE BUILDING.

06:45.636 --> 06:47.978
WAIT. BUT THAT WOULD MEAN
THAT CONRAD

06:47.978 --> 06:51.612
KNEW ABOUT THE EXPLOSION
BEFORE IT HAPPENED.

06:51.612 --> 06:54.745
DON'T TELL ANYONE
YOU SAW ME HERE.

06:54.745 --> 06:55.716
THE ONLY ADVANTAGE
I HAVE RIGHT NOW

06:55.716 --> 06:57.147
IS THAT GRAYSON THINKS
I'M DEAD.

06:57.147 --> 06:59.590
YOU CAN REACH ME
THROUGH NOLAN.

07:06.857 --> 07:08.559
IS EVERYONE OUT?

07:08.559 --> 07:10.030
WE'RE GOING FLOOR TO FLOOR.
 UH-HUH.

07:10.030 --> 07:12.102
BUT THE BLAST WAS CONTAINED
TO THE 27th AND 28th.
 RIGHT.

07:12.102 --> 07:13.634
THERE'S A MAN PINNED
UNDER SOME RUBBLE

07:13.634 --> 07:15.135
THAT WE'RE STILL TRYING
TO FREE.

07:15.135 --> 07:16.607
HE'S STILL ALIVE?

07:16.607 --> 07:18.639
MIRACULOUSLY.

07:18.639 --> 07:19.870
WHO COULD THAT BE?

07:19.870 --> 07:21.572
WE'LL KNOW SOON ENOUGH.

07:21.572 --> 07:22.743
(wailing continues)

07:22.743 --> 07:24.214
(indistinct conversations)

07:24.214 --> 07:26.216
WHAT THE HELL'S
HE DOING HERE?
 (man) STAND BACK.

07:26.216 --> 07:29.720
OH, RETURNING TO THE SCENE
OF THE CRIME.

07:29.720 --> 07:31.852
(indistinct conversations)

07:31.852 --> 07:33.724
DANIEL, THANK GOD YOU'RE
ALL RIGHT. WHERE'S EMILY?

07:33.724 --> 07:34.885
ON THE WAY TO THE HOSPITAL,
YOU SON OF A BITCH.

07:34.885 --> 07:36.056
(grunts)

07:36.056 --> 07:38.188
YOUR FATHER PUT THAT BOMB
ON FLIGHT 1-9-7,

07:38.188 --> 07:39.560
AND NOW OUR OFFICES EXPLODE?

07:39.560 --> 07:40.831
"LONG LIVE DAVID CLARKE,"
RIGHT?

07:40.831 --> 07:42.092
OKAY, YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.
YOU'RE MAKING A MIS--

07:42.092 --> 07:43.994
NO, NO. OFFICER. OFFICER.

07:43.994 --> 07:45.936
THIS MAN IS
A DISGRUNTLED FORMER EMPLOYEE

07:45.936 --> 07:47.938
WHO'S CONNECTED TO EVERYTHING
THAT'S HAPPENING.

07:47.938 --> 07:49.740
HE'S--HE...

07:49.740 --> 07:51.071
HIS NAME'S AIDEN MATHIS.

07:51.071 --> 07:53.604
I PROMISE YOU, I HAVE
ALL THE INFORMATION YOU NEED

07:53.604 --> 07:55.676
TO OPEN UP AN INVESTIGATION.

07:55.676 --> 07:57.908
THANK MERCIFUL GOD
YOU FOUND HER.

07:57.908 --> 08:00.250
WE MUST GET CHARLOTTE HOME.
IT'S NOT SAFE FOR HER HERE.

08:00.250 --> 08:01.912
OF COURSE.
THE CHOPPER'S ON STANDBY.

08:01.912 --> 08:03.754
LISTEN, A-ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

08:03.754 --> 08:04.915
I'M FINE.
I JUST WANT TO GO HOME.

08:04.915 --> 08:06.086
OKAY.

08:06.086 --> 08:07.618
(man) WATCH YOUR BACKS.
COMING THROUGH!

08:07.618 --> 08:08.989
(Charlotte) DECLAN!

08:08.989 --> 08:11.021
(man) ALL RIGHT, CLEAR
THE WAY NOW. COMING THROUGH.

08:11.021 --> 08:12.963
(crying) OH, GOD. DECLAN.

08:12.963 --> 08:14.965
(man) PLEASE STEP ASIDE.
 OH, MY GOD.

08:14.965 --> 08:16.927
(Charlotte crying)

08:16.927 --> 08:18.268
IS HE GONNA BE OKAY?

08:18.268 --> 08:20.270
OH, GOD! DECLAN!

08:20.270 --> 08:23.774
WHAT WERE YOU DOING
IN THERE?

08:23.774 --> 08:27.207
(siren wailing in distance)

08:27.207 --> 08:29.640
(key clicks)

08:29.640 --> 08:30.941
YOU WERE RIGHT.

08:30.941 --> 08:34.684
THE TEXT
CAME FROM ASHLEY'S PHONE.

08:34.684 --> 08:36.285
ARE YOU SURE
SHE'S NOT PLAYING YOU?

08:36.285 --> 08:38.818
SHE'S ACTUALLY ONE OF
THE ONLY PEOPLE I DO TRUST.

08:38.818 --> 08:42.793
SO... IT WAS CONRAD

08:42.793 --> 08:44.154
OR VICTORIA.

08:44.154 --> 08:45.525
OR BOTH.

08:45.525 --> 08:46.997
(cell phone rings)

08:46.997 --> 08:48.659
(ring, beep)

08:48.659 --> 08:50.030
(beep)

08:50.030 --> 08:51.962
(Ashley) Nolan, is Jack there?

08:51.962 --> 08:53.704
WHAT IS IT, ASH?

08:53.704 --> 08:55.566
IT'S, UH, IT'S DECLAN.

08:55.566 --> 08:57.938
APPARENTLY,
HE WAS INSIDE THE BUILDING.

08:57.938 --> 08:59.710
HE'S BEEN INJURED.

08:59.710 --> 09:01.772
I-IS HE OKAY?
 I don't know.

09:01.772 --> 09:03.744
THEY'VE TAKEN HIM
TO THE METRO HOSPITAL.

09:03.744 --> 09:06.076
THAT'S ALL THE INFORMATION
I HAVE.

09:06.076 --> 09:09.580
JACK, I'M SO SORRY,
BUT I HAVE TO GO.
 (beep)

09:11.051 --> 09:13.083
JACK, LOOK,
YOU MAY TRUST ASHLEY,

09:13.083 --> 09:14.655
BUT I DO NOT.

09:14.655 --> 09:15.886
YOU COULD BE WALKING
INTO A TRAP.

09:15.886 --> 09:17.628
YOU CAN'T RISK GETTING CAUGHT.

09:17.628 --> 09:18.759
(Emily) HE WON'T.

09:18.759 --> 09:20.931
I'LL MAKE SURE OF IT.

09:20.931 --> 09:23.794
YOU TOLD EMILY?

09:23.794 --> 09:25.165
SHE'S PRACTICALLY A GRAYSON.

09:25.165 --> 09:27.638
I TRUST EMILY WITH MY LIFE.

09:27.638 --> 09:30.801
SO DID AMANDA.

09:32.643 --> 09:34.875
IT'S TIME YOU DID, TOO.

09:44.715 --> 09:47.658
(siren wailing in distance)

09:53.764 --> 09:55.325
(unzips backpack)

09:59.630 --> 10:00.971
HOW'D YOU GET ALL THIS?

10:00.971 --> 10:04.304
SPEND A FEW YEARS IN JUVIE,
YOU LEARN A FEW TRICKS.

10:06.006 --> 10:07.337
DECLAN'S IN I.C.U.,
ROOM FIVE.

10:07.337 --> 10:08.679
I WOULD TAKE
THE SOUTH ENTRANCE IN,

10:08.679 --> 10:10.010
BUT BE CAREFUL.

10:10.010 --> 10:11.882
VICTORIA AND CHARLOTTE ARE
STILL IN THE WAITING ROOM.

10:11.882 --> 10:13.784
THERE'S NO WAY THEY'RE NOT
GONNA RECOGNIZE ME.

10:13.784 --> 10:15.285
WELL,
I'LL KEEP THEM DISTRACTED,

10:15.285 --> 10:18.118
BUT YOU CAN ONLY BE IN THERE
FOR A FEW MINUTES.

10:18.118 --> 10:20.190
I'LL MEET YOU BACK HERE
WHEN YOU'RE DONE.

10:20.190 --> 10:21.391
EMILY.

10:23.393 --> 10:24.655
(exhales)

10:24.655 --> 10:26.657
I'M NOT GONNA PRETEND
I... UNDERSTAND

10:26.657 --> 10:29.129
WHY YOU'RE DOING
ALL THIS FOR ME.

10:29.129 --> 10:32.763
YOU'VE BEEN SUFFERING.

10:34.965 --> 10:38.769
YOU'RE ANGRY.
BELIEVE ME, I...

10:38.769 --> 10:40.771
I GET IT.

10:40.771 --> 10:42.743
GOOD.

10:42.743 --> 10:44.745
'CAUSE I'M NOT SURE
HOW ALL THIS IS GONNA PLAY OUT,

10:44.745 --> 10:46.717
BUT I WAS HOPING THAT YOU'D
STILL BE CARL'S GODMOTHER

10:46.717 --> 10:48.378
IF SOMETHING SHOULD HAPPEN
TO ME.

10:48.378 --> 10:49.720
PART OF TAKING CARE OF CARL

10:49.720 --> 10:51.682
MEANS NOT LETTING ANYTHING
HAPPEN TO YOU.

10:51.682 --> 10:55.055
NOW GET DRESSED.
YOUR BROTHER NEEDS YOU.

11:00.791 --> 11:04.034
(woman speaking indistinctly
 over P.A.)

11:04.034 --> 11:05.035
(indistinct conversations)

11:05.035 --> 11:06.666
HOW IS HE? ANY WORD?

11:06.666 --> 11:08.939
AH, THE UBIQUITOUS
EMILY THORNE.

11:08.939 --> 11:11.842
THEY'LL ONLY TALK TO FAMILY.
WE'RE COMPLETELY IN THE DARK.

11:13.373 --> 11:15.245
HAVE YOU HEARD FROM JACK?

11:15.245 --> 11:16.807
HE'S NOT ANSWERING
HIS PHONE.

11:16.807 --> 11:18.709
THAT'S ASSUMING
HE HAS RECEPTION.

11:18.709 --> 11:21.051
CONRAD HAS ALL OF HIS MEN
LOOKING EVERYWHERE FOR HIM.

11:21.051 --> 11:22.753
HOW THOUGHTFUL.

11:22.753 --> 11:24.855
WELL, HOPEFULLY
HE TURNS UP UNHARMED.

11:24.855 --> 11:26.156
YOU KNOW, IT COULD
EASILY HAVE BEEN DANIEL

11:26.156 --> 11:27.788
IN THAT HOSPITAL BED.

11:27.788 --> 11:29.089
I WOULD THINK THAT
YOU WOULD WANT TO SPEND

11:29.089 --> 11:30.420
EVERY PRECIOUS MOMENT
WITH HIM,

11:30.420 --> 11:32.292
AND YET, HERE YOU ARE,
LOOKING FOR JACK.

11:32.292 --> 11:35.425
I'M HERE FOR CHARLOTTE.

11:35.425 --> 11:37.828
EMILY, THERE'S SOMETHING
I HAVE TO TELL YOU.

11:37.828 --> 11:39.699
(woman continues speaking
 indistinctly over P.A.)

11:39.699 --> 11:42.702
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

11:46.436 --> 11:48.008
(sniffles)

11:48.008 --> 11:49.379
(lowered voice)
DEC. HEY, MAN.

11:49.379 --> 11:51.141
HEY, IT'S ME.

11:51.141 --> 11:52.382
HEY.

11:52.382 --> 11:53.944
JACK?

11:53.944 --> 11:55.786
WHY ARE YOU A NURSE?

11:55.786 --> 11:57.748
(laughs)

11:57.748 --> 12:00.821
IT WAS THE ONLY WAY
I COULD GET IN TO SEE YOU.

12:00.821 --> 12:02.292
WHAT ARE
THE DOCTORS SAYING?

12:02.292 --> 12:05.495
I DON'T KNOW.
I JUST WOKE UP.

12:05.495 --> 12:07.998
WHAT HAPPENED?

12:07.998 --> 12:10.300
THERE WAS A BOMB
AT GRAYSON GLOBAL.

12:10.300 --> 12:13.233
I THINK CONRAD
MEANT IT FOR ME.

12:13.233 --> 12:16.036
I'M SORRY, MAN.
(sniffles)

12:16.036 --> 12:18.338
AHH. LOOK,

12:18.338 --> 12:20.270
WHEN YOU GET OUTTA HERE,
WE'RE GONNA TAKE CARL

12:20.270 --> 12:22.212
AND WE'RE GONNA GO
AS FAR AWAY FROM THE GRAYSONS

12:22.212 --> 12:24.114
AS POSSIBLE, OKAY?

12:24.114 --> 12:27.177
OH, IT'S GONNA BE HARD
TO LEAVE CHARLOTTE.

12:27.177 --> 12:29.119
I KNOW, BUT...

12:29.119 --> 12:30.851
THIS IS SERIOUS, DEC.

12:30.851 --> 12:33.053
YEAH, I KNOW, SO IS THIS--
SHE'S PREGNANT.

12:38.358 --> 12:40.490
CARL'S GONNA HAVE
A COUSIN.

12:47.197 --> 12:51.141
(lightning crashes)

12:55.806 --> 12:57.007
DON'T WORRY. I-I MADE SURE

12:57.007 --> 12:58.508
THE GRAYSONS
ARE ALL STILL IN THE CITY.

12:58.508 --> 12:59.810
NO ONE'S GONNA
SEE ME HERE.

13:01.812 --> 13:03.553
(sighs)

13:04.784 --> 13:06.957
(waves crash)

13:06.957 --> 13:09.419
(wind chimes tinkling)

13:12.262 --> 13:14.825
(exhales) I, UM...

13:14.825 --> 13:17.067
WANTED TO...

13:17.067 --> 13:18.568
APOLOGIZE.

13:18.568 --> 13:22.072
IT'S DONE, AIDEN.

13:22.072 --> 13:24.034
JUST GO.

13:24.034 --> 13:26.006
SAVE YOURSELF.

13:26.006 --> 13:28.939
BUT THAT'S--
THAT'S JUST IT, OKAY? I...

13:28.939 --> 13:30.841
I WANT TO SAVE YOU, TOO,

13:30.841 --> 13:33.183
FROM THIS EMPTY LIFE
OF--OF VENGEANCE.

13:33.183 --> 13:34.544
IT'S TIME.

13:34.544 --> 13:37.817
FOR YOU, MAYBE.

13:37.817 --> 13:40.550
BUT I CAN'T JUST WALK AWAY.
NOT NOW.

13:40.550 --> 13:43.523
MAYBE NOT EVER.

13:46.296 --> 13:48.198
CERTAINLY NOT FOR ME.

13:48.198 --> 13:50.360
I SPOKE TO NOLAN.

13:50.360 --> 13:52.102
I KNOW THAT
YOU WERE PREPARED

13:52.102 --> 13:54.304
TO ABANDON YOUR VENDETTA
FOR JACK LAST SUMMER.

13:54.304 --> 13:56.466
(huffs)

13:56.466 --> 13:59.839
THAT WAS A DIFFERENT TIME.

13:59.839 --> 14:02.842
SO MUCH HAS HAPPENED
SINCE THEN.

14:05.475 --> 14:06.877
HERE.

14:06.877 --> 14:09.349
(jangles)

14:09.349 --> 14:11.521
IT'S THE KEY
TO THAT VILLA ON CAPRI

14:11.521 --> 14:14.624
THAT WE USED TO TALK ABOUT,
GROWING OLD TOGETHER.

14:14.624 --> 14:16.927
(thunder rumbling)

14:16.927 --> 14:18.488
YOU KEEP IT.

14:20.860 --> 14:24.864
IF YOU CHANGE YOUR MIND,
THEN I CAN JOIN YOU THERE.

14:27.567 --> 14:29.569
HEY.

14:29.569 --> 14:31.871
(exhales)

14:44.184 --> 14:48.558
I HOPE YOU GET WHAT
YOU'RE LOOKING FOR, AMANDA.

14:48.558 --> 14:52.392
NO ONE HAS EVER DESERVED IT
MORE THAN YOU.

14:57.067 --> 14:58.628
GOOD-BYE.

14:59.629 --> 15:03.533
(thunder rumbling)

15:24.554 --> 15:28.698
(woman speaking indistinctly
 over P.A.)

15:28.698 --> 15:31.962
HEY. UH, YOU CAN GO IN
FOR A FEW MINUTES, OKAY?

15:31.962 --> 15:35.235
HE'S A VERY BRAVE YOUNG MAN.

15:40.140 --> 15:41.711
OH, MY GOD.
 (door closes)

15:41.711 --> 15:43.273
DECLAN.

15:43.273 --> 15:44.614
I AM SO SORRY.

15:44.614 --> 15:46.146
I NEVER SHOULD'VE LISTENED
TO REGINA.

15:46.146 --> 15:47.377
NO.
 NONE OF THIS
WOULD'VE HAPPENED.

15:47.377 --> 15:48.578
NO, NO, NO, NO.

15:48.578 --> 15:51.251
IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT.
I'M JUST--

15:51.251 --> 15:53.423
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU WAITED
OUT THERE ALL NIGHT.

15:53.423 --> 15:54.954
THE DOCTORS WOULDN'T
TELL ME ANYTHING.

15:54.954 --> 15:56.456
I WAS SICK WITH WORRY.

15:56.456 --> 15:58.688
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

15:58.688 --> 16:00.530
YOU KNOW WHAT? THEY SAY
I'M GONNA BE FINE.

16:00.530 --> 16:02.062
THANK GOD.

16:02.062 --> 16:04.194
I CANNOT FACE ALL OF THIS
WITHOUT YOU.

16:04.194 --> 16:06.336
YOU ARE STRONGER
THAN YOU THINK, CHARLOTTE.

16:06.336 --> 16:08.698
I NEED YOU
TO BELIEVE THAT.

16:08.698 --> 16:10.370
AFTER ALL,
WITH US AS PARENTS,

16:10.370 --> 16:12.472
THE KID'S GONNA BE A HANDFUL,
ISN'T HE?

16:12.472 --> 16:15.045
ARE YOU SURE
THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT?

16:15.045 --> 16:17.647
DON'T YOU?

16:17.647 --> 16:19.349
YOU'RE GONNA BE
A GREAT MOTHER.

16:19.349 --> 16:21.351
BASED ON WHAT?

16:21.351 --> 16:24.014
I HAVE THE WORST ROLE MODELS
IN PARENTAL HISTORY.

16:24.014 --> 16:27.017
YOU KNOW
EXACTLY WHAT NOT TO DO.

16:27.017 --> 16:28.188
(laughs)

16:28.188 --> 16:29.319
(laughs)

16:29.319 --> 16:32.122
AW, THAT'S WHAT I WANTED
TO SEE.

16:33.493 --> 16:35.725
GO HOME AND GET SOME REST.

16:35.725 --> 16:39.499
IF NOT FOR YOURSELF,
THEN AT LEAST FOR THE BABY.

16:39.499 --> 16:43.173
TIME YOU SEE ME NEXT,
I'M GONNA BE AS GOOD AS NEW.

16:56.316 --> 16:57.487
(knock on door)

16:57.487 --> 16:59.018
(Nolan) EMILY?
 (door opens)

17:00.450 --> 17:03.353
(exhales deeply)

17:03.353 --> 17:05.454
EMS?

17:07.327 --> 17:09.499
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

17:12.132 --> 17:13.463
AIDEN'S GONE.

17:13.463 --> 17:16.366
HE'S SAFE FOR NOW.

17:16.366 --> 17:18.438
(sighs)

17:18.438 --> 17:20.170
HE WAS...

17:20.170 --> 17:22.372
ACTUALLY ABLE
TO WALK AWAY FROM YOU?

17:22.372 --> 17:24.473
(exhales) IN NO SMALL PART
BECAUSE YOU TOLD HIM

17:24.473 --> 17:26.516
WHAT HAPPENED
WITH JACK LAST YEAR.

17:29.749 --> 17:31.451
I...

17:31.451 --> 17:36.356
I DIDN'T KNOW THAT YOU WERE
KEEPING IT A SECRET FROM HIM.

17:36.356 --> 17:40.530
AFTER EVERYTHING THAT
HE HAS SACRIFICED FOR YOU,

17:40.530 --> 17:42.762
DON'T YOU THINK
HE DESERVED THE TRUTH?

17:42.762 --> 17:46.266
(sighs) HE DESERVES BETTER.

17:48.168 --> 17:49.499
SO DOES JACK.

17:51.341 --> 17:53.703
SPEAKING OF...

17:55.205 --> 17:56.676
HOW'S HE HOLDING UP?

17:56.676 --> 18:00.380
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
HE WAS SUPPOSED TO BE WITH YOU.

18:00.380 --> 18:02.552
I DROPPED HIM OFF AT NOLCORP
LAST NIGHT.

18:02.552 --> 18:05.155
HE WANTED TO STAY CLOSE
TO THE HOSPITAL.

18:05.155 --> 18:07.157
NO, I-I WAS THERE LATE.
HE NEVER SHOWED UP.

18:07.157 --> 18:08.688
OH, GOD. OKAY.

18:08.688 --> 18:11.391
YOU GO TO THE HOSPITAL IN CASE
HE WENT TO CHECK ON DECLAN.

18:11.391 --> 18:13.092
I'LL GO TO THE GRAYSONS'

18:13.092 --> 18:15.195
IN CASE HE DECIDED
TO GO AFTER THEM.

18:15.195 --> 18:16.466
MAYBE YOU SHOULD LET HIM.

18:17.767 --> 18:20.700
YOU AND MOM WERE RIGHT.

18:20.700 --> 18:24.434
IT TURNS OUT AIDEN MATHIS
REALLY WAS PART OF IT.

18:24.434 --> 18:25.705
OH.

18:25.705 --> 18:28.608
YEAH, HE WIPED OUT
THE AMANDA CLARKE FOUNDATION.

18:28.608 --> 18:30.440
OUR MONEY IS GONE.

18:30.440 --> 18:32.512
MONEY COMES. MONEY GOES.

18:32.512 --> 18:33.813
OH, NO, NO, NO, NO.

18:33.813 --> 18:35.645
I'M TALKING
EVERY PENNY HERE.

18:35.645 --> 18:37.347
AND I NEVER CASHED
THAT CHECK YOU WROTE ME,

18:37.347 --> 18:39.149
SO IT'S NOT EVEN WORTH
THE PAPER IT'S WRITTEN ON.

18:39.149 --> 18:40.490
WE'VE GOT NOTHING.

18:40.490 --> 18:43.623
WE HAVE WHAT MATTERS.

18:43.623 --> 18:46.726
WE HAVE OUR NAME, DANIEL.
WE'RE GRAYSONS.

18:46.726 --> 18:49.829
WE STARE DOWN ADVERSITY.

18:49.829 --> 18:51.361
WE REBUILD,

18:51.361 --> 18:53.333
BRICK BY BRICK.

18:53.333 --> 18:54.804
YOU AND I
ARE GONNA SHOW THE WORLD

18:54.804 --> 18:58.208
THAT WHEN THE HOUR IS DARKEST,
WE GRAYSONS SHINE THE BRIGHTEST.

18:58.208 --> 18:59.539
IT'S A NICE SPEECH, DAD.

18:59.539 --> 19:01.471
I WISH YOU LUCK
ON YOUR CRUSADE,

19:01.471 --> 19:03.873
BUT I WON'T BE JOINING YOU.

19:03.873 --> 19:06.376
I'M SORRY.
PARIS IS OFF THE TABLE.

19:06.376 --> 19:07.847
WE NEED YOU HERE.

19:07.847 --> 19:10.420
YOU REALLY THINK I WANT TO BE
A PART OF THIS ANYMORE?

19:10.420 --> 19:13.253
I'M STARTING A NEW LIFE
WITH EMILY.

19:13.253 --> 19:15.485
THE ONLY REASON YOU HAVE A LIFE
IS BECAUSE YOU'RE MY SON

19:15.485 --> 19:18.888
AND I WASN'T ABOUT TO LET THEM
KILL YOU YESTERDAY!

19:18.888 --> 19:21.891
(wind whistling)

19:25.565 --> 19:27.667
YOU KNEW?

19:27.667 --> 19:29.699
I WAS POWERLESS
TO STOP IT.

19:29.699 --> 19:32.272
MITIGATING
THE COLLATERAL DAMAGE

19:32.272 --> 19:33.643
WAS MY ONLY OPTION,

19:33.643 --> 19:35.945
AND THANKFULLY, IT PROVED
TO BE AN EFFECTIVE ONE.

19:35.945 --> 19:38.378
THIS IS WHAT YOU CALL
MITIGATING DAMAGE?

19:38.378 --> 19:40.780
HAVE YOU LOST
YOUR DAMN MIND?!

19:40.780 --> 19:43.383
COMPARED TO THE INITIATIVE'S
PREVIOUS ACTS OF TERROR,

19:43.383 --> 19:45.485
THIS WAS A TRIUMPH!

19:45.485 --> 19:47.217
NO LIVES WERE LOST,
INCLUDING YOURS.

19:47.217 --> 19:50.220
AND FOR THAT,
YOU ARE ENTIRELY IN MY DEBT,

19:50.220 --> 19:52.222
WHICH IS WHY WHEN I'M
ELECTED GOVERNOR TONIGHT,

19:52.222 --> 19:55.865
I EXPECT TO SEE YOU
BY MY SIDE.

20:01.531 --> 20:02.872
SO JUST, UM,
TRY TO RELAX.

20:02.872 --> 20:04.474
YOU KNOW, THE HEART SURGEON'S
ON STANDBY,

20:04.474 --> 20:06.476
AND WE'LL GET YOU IN THERE
THE SECOND THAT STENT ARRIVES.

20:06.476 --> 20:08.508
ALL RIGHT. LET'S PRAY
FOR GREEN LIGHTS.

20:08.508 --> 20:09.909
RIGHT. SEE YOU SOON.

20:09.909 --> 20:11.341
MM-HMM.

20:11.341 --> 20:14.884
(woman speaking indistinctly
 over P.A.)

20:14.884 --> 20:17.317
HEY.

20:17.317 --> 20:19.289
UH...

20:21.351 --> 20:23.523
HEART SURGERY?

20:23.523 --> 20:26.256
I THOUGHT CHARLOTTE TOLD EMILY
YOU WERE GONNA BE FINE.

20:26.256 --> 20:28.358
WELL, I LIED.

20:30.530 --> 20:32.532
LISTEN, IF--
IF IT DOESN'T GO WELL,

20:32.532 --> 20:35.405
I DON'T WANT HER LAST MEMORY
TO BE ABOUT THAT.

20:35.405 --> 20:38.508
I WANT IT TO BE ABOUT US
AND OUR KID AND...

20:38.508 --> 20:41.311
OH, I REALLY NEEDED
TO SEE HER SMILE.

20:41.311 --> 20:43.573
AND SHE DID.

20:43.573 --> 20:45.375
(exhales)

20:45.375 --> 20:47.877
THEY'RE FLYING THAT STENT THING
IN FROM NORTH CAROLINA.

20:47.877 --> 20:49.379
APPARENTLY, IT'S GONNA
COME DOWN TO THE WIRE.

20:49.379 --> 20:51.381
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

20:51.381 --> 20:53.383
I'M GONNA CALL IN
THE BEST DOCTORS, ALL RIGHT?

20:53.383 --> 20:55.555
I-I'LL SPEND
EVERY DIME THAT I HAVE.

20:55.555 --> 20:58.358
BUT WHAT I NEED, NOLAN,
IS TIME.

20:58.358 --> 21:01.961
YOU--YOU CAN'T BUY ME THAT.

21:01.961 --> 21:03.563
NOLAN...

21:06.466 --> 21:09.539
IF I DON'T MAKE IT,

21:09.539 --> 21:12.041
JACK IS GONNA NEED YOU
MORE THAN EVER.

21:12.041 --> 21:13.473
HEY.

21:13.473 --> 21:16.376
I WILL ALWAYS
BE THERE FOR JACK.

21:16.376 --> 21:18.578
BUT YOU...

21:18.578 --> 21:20.910
ARE NOT GOING ANYWHERE,
DECLAN.

21:20.910 --> 21:24.053
YOU GOT THAT?

21:24.053 --> 21:26.416
(Conrad on TV)
 JACK PORTER, FAMILY FRIEND

21:26.416 --> 21:28.718
AND STAUNCH SUPPORTER,
 REMAINS UNACCOUNTED FOR

21:28.718 --> 21:31.661
WHILE HIS BROTHER DECLAN
 FIGHTS FOR HIS LIFE.

21:31.661 --> 21:33.363
AND THOUGH
 WE HOPE FOR THE BEST,

21:33.363 --> 21:35.465
WE FEAR THE WORST.

21:35.465 --> 21:36.766
I URGE YOU TO CAST YOUR VOTE

21:36.766 --> 21:38.468
AND SHOW
 THESE ENEMIES OF FREEDOM

21:38.468 --> 21:39.969
THAT WE WILL PREVAIL.

21:39.969 --> 21:41.631
I'M SURPRISED TO SEE
YOU'RE NOT VOTING

21:41.631 --> 21:43.633
ALONGSIDE YOUR HUSBAND.
 (mutes TV)

21:43.633 --> 21:45.635
AND I WISH I COULD SAY
I WERE EQUALLY SURPRISED

21:45.635 --> 21:48.338
TO SEE YOU HERE
UNANNOUNCED IN MY HOME.

21:48.338 --> 21:49.639
I JUST WANTED TO SEE
IF CONRAD WAS PLANNING

21:49.639 --> 21:51.040
TO GO THROUGH
WITH HIS PARTY,

21:51.040 --> 21:54.083
SEEING AS JACK
IS STILL MISSING.

21:55.785 --> 21:57.647
WELL, THE PARTY WILL GO ON,

21:57.647 --> 21:59.619
AND CONRAD WILL BE THERE,
FRONT AND CENTER.

21:59.619 --> 22:00.850
(chuckles)

22:00.850 --> 22:03.052
BUT NOT YOU.

22:03.052 --> 22:05.555
YOU WILL SOON LEARN...

22:05.555 --> 22:07.727
THAT THERE ARE LIMITS TO WHAT
A WOMAN IS WILLING TO ENDURE

22:07.727 --> 22:09.499
FOR APPEARANCES.

22:09.499 --> 22:11.000
(sets down remote control)
 MEANING?

22:11.000 --> 22:12.702
YOU AND DANIEL.

22:13.933 --> 22:15.505
WHATEVER YOUR REASONS
FOR MARRYING HIM,

22:15.505 --> 22:17.837
YOU'LL NEVER CONVINCE ME
IT'S FOR LOVE.

22:17.837 --> 22:20.570
AND BY AND BY,

22:20.570 --> 22:23.743
YOU WILL GROW TIRED
OF PERPETUATING THIS CHARADE.

22:23.743 --> 22:26.876
UNTIL ONE MORNING,
YOU WILL WAKE UP HOLLOW

22:26.876 --> 22:30.720
WITH NOTHING BUT REGRET
AND MISERY TO FILL YOUR DAYS.

22:30.720 --> 22:34.684
SEEMS TO ME THAT REGRET
AND MISERY IS EVERYTHING

22:34.684 --> 22:37.056
THAT DANIEL'S LOOKING
TO LEAVE BEHIND.

22:37.056 --> 22:38.828
SAME WITH CHARLOTTE.

22:38.828 --> 22:41.391
SHE SEEMS ENCHANTED
WITH THE IDEA OF PARIS.

22:41.391 --> 22:43.433
MAYBE SHE'LL EVEN WANT
TO RAISE HER BABY THERE.

22:43.433 --> 22:44.934
AND NOW YOU PRESUME TO KNOW

22:44.934 --> 22:46.896
WHAT'S BEST FOR CHARLOTTE
AS WELL.

22:46.896 --> 22:48.538
VICTORIA,
I DON'T MAKE DECISIONS

22:48.538 --> 22:49.839
FOR YOUR CHILDREN.

22:49.839 --> 22:52.542
I'M SORRY THAT YOU CAN'T
SEE THAT. EXCUSE ME.

22:52.542 --> 22:55.044
YOU KNOW,
THERE ALWAYS WAS SOMETHING

22:55.044 --> 22:58.908
THAT I COULD NEVER
PUT MY FINGER ON ABOUT YOU.

23:01.811 --> 23:03.753
YOU AND I HAVE
MORE IN COMMON

23:03.753 --> 23:06.085
THAN EITHER ONE OF US
CARES TO ADMIT.

23:06.085 --> 23:09.459
TELL ME.

23:09.459 --> 23:11.120
FEROCITY.

23:12.462 --> 23:15.565
AN EMBEDDED DETERMINATION
TO GET WHATEVER WE WANT,

23:15.565 --> 23:17.627
NO MATTER WHAT THE COST.

23:17.627 --> 23:19.429
DO NOT FORGET

23:19.429 --> 23:21.771
THAT I HAVE BEEN AT THIS
MUCH LONGER THAN YOU.

23:21.771 --> 23:23.673
AND IF YOU CONTINUE

23:23.673 --> 23:26.476
TO TRY TO TEAR MY CHILDREN
AWAY FROM ME,

23:26.476 --> 23:28.478
I PROMISE YOU
THAT YOU WILL NOT ONLY FAIL,

23:28.478 --> 23:29.909
BUT YOU WILL SUFFER.

23:29.909 --> 23:33.142
AND HAVE NO DOUBT...

23:33.142 --> 23:34.944
I WILL SHOW NO MERCY.

23:36.185 --> 23:38.688
HOW SAD FOR YOU, VICTORIA...

23:38.688 --> 23:40.520
THAT OF YOUR THREE CHILDREN,

23:40.520 --> 23:42.592
THE TWO THAT YOU DECIDED
TO ACKNOWLEDGE

23:42.592 --> 23:45.124
WANT NOTHING
TO DO WITH YOU.

23:45.124 --> 23:47.056
THAT'S THE TRUTH.

23:52.932 --> 23:54.564
(click, TV unmutes)

23:54.564 --> 23:57.206
(woman) THE SUSPECT,
 IDENTIFIED AS AIDEN MATHIS,

23:57.206 --> 23:58.708
WAS DETAINED
 EARLIER THIS EVENING

23:58.708 --> 24:00.470
AT THE CANADIAN BORDER.

24:00.470 --> 24:02.942
MATHIS HAD BEEN RECENTLY
 FIRED BY GRAYSON GLOBAL

24:02.942 --> 24:05.475
AND MAY BE THE MASTERMIND

24:05.475 --> 24:07.577
BEHIND THE CYBER ATTACKS
 ON NEW YORK

24:07.577 --> 24:11.080
AND YESTERDAY'S BOMBING.

24:18.988 --> 24:22.031
AIDEN MATHIS HAS BEEN
TAKEN INTO CUSTODY.

24:22.031 --> 24:23.563
(door closes)

24:23.563 --> 24:25.565
EXCUSE ME
IF I SKIP THE CHAMPAGNE.

24:25.565 --> 24:27.637
DANIEL,
HE'S FAR FROM INNOCENT.

24:27.637 --> 24:28.998
YOU KNOW, I DON'T TAKE JOY

24:28.998 --> 24:30.970
IN DESTROYING THE LIVES
OF OTHERS, INNOCENT OR NOT.

24:30.970 --> 24:32.642
YOU MUST GET PAST THIS.

24:32.642 --> 24:34.043
A CHOICE LEFT UNRESOLVED

24:34.043 --> 24:36.906
HAS THE POWER
TO RUIN YOUR SOUL. I KNOW.

24:36.906 --> 24:39.148
YOU KNOW, AIDEN DIDN'T BLOW UP
GRAYSON GLOBAL.

24:39.148 --> 24:40.980
IT WAS THE INITIATIVE.

24:40.980 --> 24:44.654
AND DAD
KNEW ALL ABOUT IT.

24:44.654 --> 24:45.855
WHAT?

24:45.855 --> 24:47.557
YEAH, HE'S ONE OF THEM.

24:47.557 --> 24:48.958
AND SO ARE YOU,
FOR ALL I KNOW.

24:48.958 --> 24:50.960
BUT EITHER WAY,

24:50.960 --> 24:53.222
YOU'RE COMPLETELY ALONE NOW.

24:54.894 --> 24:57.967
EXACTLY WHAT YOU DESERVE.

25:03.633 --> 25:06.275
JUDGING FROM
YOUR LACKLUSTER APPEARANCE,

25:06.275 --> 25:09.879
YOU'VE YET TO SEE
TODAY'S EXIT POLLS.

25:09.879 --> 25:11.811
IF THEY ARE TO BE BELIEVED,

25:11.811 --> 25:13.813
YOU WILL BE ATTENDING
TONIGHT'S GALA

25:13.813 --> 25:16.746
ON THE ARM OF
NEW YORK'S GOVERNOR-ELECT.

25:18.618 --> 25:21.551
YOU KNEW ABOUT THAT BOMB.

25:21.551 --> 25:23.623
POSITIONED
CAMPAIGN HEADQUARTERS

25:23.623 --> 25:27.096
SO THAT YOU COULD BE
A FIRST RESPONDER.

25:27.096 --> 25:29.999
YOU'VE BEEN
WITH THE INITIATIVE ALL ALONG.

25:29.999 --> 25:32.902
THERE IS NO INITIATIVE,
MY DEAR.

25:32.902 --> 25:35.935
THERE NEVER WAS.
NOT REALLY.

25:35.935 --> 25:40.039
SIMPLY A CONSORTIUM
OF SAVVY BUSINESSPERSONS

25:40.039 --> 25:41.571
WHO PERFECTED THE ART

25:41.571 --> 25:44.043
OF PROFITING
OFF OTHER PEOPLE'S FEAR.

25:46.816 --> 25:49.078
IF HUMAN CATASTROPHE STRIKES,

25:49.078 --> 25:51.080
THE PUBLIC SPENDS MONEY.

25:51.080 --> 25:52.852
LOTS OF IT.

25:52.852 --> 25:56.926
(pouring liquor)
 AND IF ONE WERE ABLE
TO ANTICIPATE SUCH DISASTERS,

25:56.926 --> 25:59.258
THEY'D STAND TO MAKE
A FORTUNE.

25:59.258 --> 26:02.862
OF COURSE,
PREDICTING THESE ACTS OF GOD

26:02.862 --> 26:04.133
IS IMPOSSIBLE.

26:04.133 --> 26:09.869
UNLESS, OF COURSE,
ONE DECIDES TO... PLAY GOD.

26:11.340 --> 26:13.072
ON THE HEELS
OF FLIGHT 1-9-7,

26:13.072 --> 26:16.005
THE F.A.A. GRANTED BILLIONS
IN SECURITY CONTRACTS.

26:16.005 --> 26:18.007
THE STOCKS
FOR THOSE COMPANIES QUADRUPLED.

26:18.007 --> 26:21.080
AND THOSE THAT WERE IN THE KNOW
COLLECTED HANDSOMELY.

26:21.080 --> 26:23.282
SO WHEN I WAS TIPPED OFF
ABOUT THE INEVITABILITY

26:23.282 --> 26:25.815
OF RECENT EVENTS,
I OPTED IN.

26:25.815 --> 26:27.316
TIPPED OFF BY WHOM?

26:27.316 --> 26:29.318
(Helen) HELLO, CONRAD.

26:29.318 --> 26:31.661
SO WHAT DO YOU WANT
 FROM ME?

26:31.661 --> 26:33.092
WELL, YOUR UNIQUE POSITION

26:33.092 --> 26:37.927
AND THE FINANCIAL SERVICES
 YOU WERE ABLE TO PROVIDE TO US

26:37.927 --> 26:40.269
WORKED OUT SO WELL
 IN THE PAST...

26:40.269 --> 26:42.171
I HAD NO IDEA
YOU WERE GONNA USE THEM

26:42.171 --> 26:43.803
TO BLOW UP A JET LINER.

26:43.803 --> 26:45.074
NOR WILL YOU HAVE ANY IDEA

26:45.074 --> 26:47.777
WHAT WE HAVE PLANNED
 THIS TIME AROUND.

26:50.009 --> 26:52.141
I ACCEPTED
HELEN'S PROPOSAL

26:52.141 --> 26:55.685
ON ONE CONDITION--
ENTRY TO THEIR INNER CIRCLE,

26:55.685 --> 26:57.687
GRANTING ME,
AMONG OTHER THINGS,

26:57.687 --> 26:59.849
INTIMATE ACCESS
TO THEIR TIMETABLE.

26:59.849 --> 27:02.922
THAT'S DESPICABLE,
EVEN FOR YOU.

27:02.922 --> 27:04.253
I DID WHAT I HAD TO DO
FOR OUR FUTURE.

27:04.253 --> 27:07.326
WE ARE NOW POSITIONED
TO TRIPLE OUR PREVIOUS WEALTH,

27:07.326 --> 27:09.699
AND OUR HANDS REMAIN CLEAN.
 NOT MINE.

27:09.699 --> 27:12.161
YOU LED ME TO BELIEVE THAT
DANIEL WAS IN DANGER ALL SUMMER.

27:12.161 --> 27:14.033
I COMMITTED MURDER
TO PROTECT HIM!

27:14.033 --> 27:16.035
IT'S A MISTAKE THAT NEARLY
DERAILED EVERYTHING,

27:16.035 --> 27:17.937
AND IF IT WEREN'T FOR
MY MASTERY OF PERSUASION,

27:17.937 --> 27:20.409
YOU'D PROBABLY BE BURIED
BESIDE HELEN CROWLEY RIGHT NOW.

27:20.409 --> 27:22.111
DO YOU EXPECT ME
TO THANK YOU?

27:22.111 --> 27:24.974
NO, I EXPECT YOU TO PERFORM
THE ROLE OF DEVOTED WIFE

27:24.974 --> 27:28.047
LIKE YOU NEVER HAVE BEFORE.
YOU FAIL TO DO SO,

27:28.047 --> 27:30.049
THEN PREPARE TO RETURN
TO THE PENNILESS SQUALOR

27:30.049 --> 27:32.081
FROM WHENCE I PLUCKED YOU.

27:32.081 --> 27:33.753
(gasps)

27:33.753 --> 27:35.985
(spits)

27:37.957 --> 27:42.061
WELL, THE HELLCAT I MARRIED
REARS HER DECLASSE HEAD.

27:43.432 --> 27:45.935
OH, YOU BE SURE
TO LEAVE HER AT HOME

27:45.935 --> 27:48.968
WHEN YOU JOIN ME
ON STAGE TONIGHT...

27:48.968 --> 27:51.971
ONCE YOU'VE COME
TO YOUR FEEBLE SENSES.

27:56.345 --> 28:00.409
(indistinct conversations)

28:00.409 --> 28:04.714
(man speaking indistinctly
 over P.A.)

28:04.714 --> 28:06.155
(Nolan) JACK.

28:09.118 --> 28:11.791
WHAT'S GOING ON?
WHERE'S DEC?

28:15.024 --> 28:16.996
HE ASKED ME
TO RECORD THIS FOR YOU.

28:28.978 --> 28:31.440
(beep)

28:31.440 --> 28:32.942
(clears throat)

28:32.942 --> 28:35.915
WE'VE BEEN THROUGH A LOT,
 BIG BROTHER.

28:35.915 --> 28:40.019
I KNOW I WOULDN'T HAVE MADE IT
 THIS FAR WITHOUT YOU.

28:40.019 --> 28:42.421
HEY, CARL IS THE LUCKIEST KID
 IN THE WORLD,

28:42.421 --> 28:45.294
HAVING YOU AS A DAD.

28:45.294 --> 28:47.797
I KNOW THAT 'CAUSE YOU'VE
 BEEN ONE TO ME, TOO.

28:51.100 --> 28:52.501
(exhales)

28:52.501 --> 28:55.204
AND I LOVE YOU SO MUCH, JACK.

28:56.906 --> 28:58.908
YOU CAN TURN IT OFF.

29:00.409 --> 29:03.072
(cries and sniffles)

29:03.072 --> 29:05.244
ALL RIGHT.
WHERE'S MY BROTHER?

29:05.244 --> 29:06.946
I WANT TO SEE HIM.

29:06.946 --> 29:09.078
(exhales)

29:09.078 --> 29:11.320
HIS ARTERY RUPTURED.

29:11.320 --> 29:12.952
WHERE IS HE?

29:15.354 --> 29:17.326
(cries) HE'S GONE, JACK.

29:21.030 --> 29:23.132
(crying)

29:23.132 --> 29:25.034
NO.

29:27.066 --> 29:30.069
(sobbing)

29:31.200 --> 29:32.902
(crying) COME ON, JACK.

29:32.902 --> 29:34.944
LET'S JUST GRAB CARL.
LET'S HIT THE ROAD.

29:34.944 --> 29:36.275
LET'S DISAPPEAR.
IT'S GONE TOO FAR.

29:36.275 --> 29:37.907
NO, NO, NO! NO.

29:37.907 --> 29:39.248
NO MORE HIDING.

29:39.248 --> 29:40.910
THAT MAN HAS TAKEN EVERYTHING
FROM ME.

29:40.910 --> 29:43.082
NOTHING--
NOT YOU, NOT ANYONE--

29:43.082 --> 29:45.084
IS GONNA KEEP ME
FROM MAKING GRAYSON PAY

29:45.084 --> 29:46.355
FOR WHAT HE'S DONE.

29:46.355 --> 29:47.456
(sniffles)

29:48.858 --> 29:50.159
(cell phone rings)

29:50.159 --> 29:51.921
(ring, beep)

29:51.921 --> 29:54.023
WHAT DID THE DOCTOR SAY?

29:54.023 --> 29:56.966
(Nolan, crying)
Ems, Declan's dead.

29:56.966 --> 29:58.297
WHAT?

29:58.297 --> 30:00.329
His aortic artery
ruptured.

30:00.329 --> 30:02.932
(crying) OH, NO.

30:02.932 --> 30:04.934
JACK WAS JUST HERE.
(sniffles)

30:04.934 --> 30:07.877
HE'S--HE'S GOING
OUT OF HIS MIND.

30:07.877 --> 30:10.079
(sniffles) I DON'T KNOW
WHAT HE'S GONNA DO NEXT.

30:10.079 --> 30:12.111
I DO.

30:12.111 --> 30:14.914
WE HAVE TO GET
TO THE VICTORY PARTY NOW.

30:14.914 --> 30:17.186
I'LL MEET YOU THERE.
 (beep)

30:17.186 --> 30:18.848
(sniffles)

30:28.527 --> 30:30.599
(closes drawer)

30:35.234 --> 30:38.107
MY BROTHER'S DEAD.

30:38.107 --> 30:39.939
OH, JACK, I'M SO SORRY.

30:39.939 --> 30:41.540
SORRY IT WASN'T ME?

30:41.540 --> 30:43.943
YOU BETRAYED ME.

30:43.943 --> 30:46.445
YOU USED ME AND THEN
YOU TRIED TO GET RID OF ME.

30:46.445 --> 30:47.977
NO, I PROMISE YOU,

30:47.977 --> 30:48.948
I DIDN'T KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT THAT BOMB.

30:48.948 --> 30:50.519
CONRAD--
 STOP LYING!

30:57.086 --> 30:58.127
DO IT.

30:58.127 --> 30:59.588
(exhales)

30:59.588 --> 31:01.260
PULL THE TRIGGER.

31:01.260 --> 31:03.092
I DESERVE IT.

31:08.237 --> 31:09.438
NO.

31:11.570 --> 31:14.974
WHAT YOU DESERVE...

31:14.974 --> 31:17.106
IS TO EXPLAIN
TO YOUR GRANDCHILD

31:17.106 --> 31:19.348
WHY HE DOESN'T HAVE
A FATHER.

31:19.348 --> 31:22.411
WHAT YOU DESERVE...

31:22.411 --> 31:26.415
IS TO LIVE A VERY LONG,
VERY PAINFUL...

31:26.415 --> 31:30.119
TORTURED LIFE...

31:30.119 --> 31:32.191
UNLIKE YOUR HUSBAND.

31:34.023 --> 31:35.364
IF I WERE YOU,

31:35.364 --> 31:38.397
I'D BREAK THE NEWS
TO CHARLOTTE VERY GENTLY.

31:38.397 --> 31:41.370
YOU KNOW HOW SHE TAKES
THESE THINGS.

31:51.280 --> 31:52.982
(telephone ringing in distance)

31:52.982 --> 31:56.015
WE'VE CANCELED YOUR REQUEST
FOR AN ATTORNEY, MR. MATHIS.

31:56.015 --> 31:58.387
(door closes)
 WHAT? Y-YOU CAN'T DENY ME
MY RIGHTS.

31:58.387 --> 31:59.548
WE AREN'T.

31:59.548 --> 32:01.020
THE NATURE OF OUR QUESTIONING
HAS SHIFTED.

32:09.098 --> 32:10.259
(man) FREEZE! FBI!

32:10.259 --> 32:12.031
GET ON THE GROUND.

32:12.031 --> 32:13.532
DON'T MOVE.
 TAKE HIM DOWN!

32:13.532 --> 32:15.234
(Nolan) AH! WHAT THE HELL
IS GOING ON?!
 TAKE HIM DOWN.

32:15.234 --> 32:16.505
LET'S GO. FACEDOWN.

32:16.505 --> 32:17.967
NOLAN ROSS,

32:17.967 --> 32:19.108
YOU'VE UNDER ARREST...
 YOU'RE HURTING ME!

32:19.108 --> 32:21.040
FOR EXECUTING WILLFUL ACTS
OF TERROR

32:21.040 --> 32:23.272
AGAINST
THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.

32:23.272 --> 32:24.643
(handcuffs click)

32:57.206 --> 32:58.247
CHARLOTTE.

33:01.350 --> 33:04.313
MOM... WHAT IS IT?

33:10.019 --> 33:12.391
I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW
HOW MUCH I LOVE YOU.

33:17.026 --> 33:19.468
YOU REST.

33:19.468 --> 33:21.170
WE'LL TALK IN THE MORNING.

33:34.213 --> 33:35.644
HEY, EMS. YOU UP THERE?

33:35.644 --> 33:38.117
LITTLE CHANGE OF PLANS
 CE SOIR.

33:38.117 --> 33:40.449
YOU GOT THAT RIGHT,
 MON FRERE.

33:44.053 --> 33:46.095
WHERE THE HELL IS EMILY?

33:46.095 --> 33:47.126
SUFFERING...

33:47.126 --> 33:50.799
QUITE TERRIBLY,
I ASSURE YOU.

33:50.799 --> 33:52.501
BUT SHE DID LEAVE YOU
A NOTE.

34:00.539 --> 34:02.611
IT SEEMS SHE'LL BE ENDURING

34:02.611 --> 34:05.074
YOUR FATHER'S MASSIVE HOAX
ALL BY HERSELF.

34:05.074 --> 34:06.075
NO, YOU'RE THE HOAX,
MATHIS.

34:06.075 --> 34:07.216
EVERYTHING ABOUT YOU
HAS BEEN A LIE

34:07.216 --> 34:08.777
SINCE THE DAY
YOU SHOWED UP.

34:08.777 --> 34:10.619
YES, WELL, FORTUNATELY,
THE AUTHORITIES

34:10.619 --> 34:13.081
DON'T SHARE YOUR LITTLE
PARANOID DELUSION.

34:13.081 --> 34:15.484
THEY LET YOU GO?

34:15.484 --> 34:17.286
BECAUSE I'M NOT INITIATIVE,
DANIEL.

34:17.286 --> 34:20.089
I DIDN'T BLOW UP YOUR FAMILY'S
GODFORSAKEN COMPANY

34:20.089 --> 34:21.260
ANY MORE THAN MY FATHER

34:21.260 --> 34:23.262
WILLINGLY PUT A BOMB
ON FLIGHT 197.

34:23.262 --> 34:26.534
EVERY DROP OF BLOOD
THE INITIATIVE HAS SPILLED

34:26.534 --> 34:28.697
IS ON GRAYSON HANDS AS WELL,
AND YOU KNOW IT.

34:28.697 --> 34:32.571
AND THE SOONER THAT YOU START
TO REPAY THAT DEBT,

34:32.571 --> 34:34.572
THE BETTER IT'S GONNA BE
FOR EVERYONE,

34:34.572 --> 34:38.277
INCLUDING THE WOMAN
WHO YOU... CLAIM TO LOVE.

34:38.277 --> 34:40.309
YOU DON'T KNOW A DAMN THING
ABOUT OUR RELATIONSHIP.

34:40.309 --> 34:42.311
WELL, I KNOW ENOUGH TO KNOW
THAT IF YOU TWO WERE MARRIED,

34:42.311 --> 34:44.253
YOU'D SPEND THE REST
OF YOUR LIFE REGRETTING IT.

34:46.155 --> 34:49.757
(both grunting)

34:55.194 --> 34:59.228
YOU STUPID, ARROGANT BOY.

34:59.228 --> 35:02.231
(grunting)

35:03.732 --> 35:05.134
(grunts)

35:05.134 --> 35:06.335
OHH!

35:07.536 --> 35:09.208
(objects clatter)

35:09.208 --> 35:10.839
I'VE JUST GIVEN YOU SOMETHING
A MAN LIKE YOU

35:10.839 --> 35:12.641
IS RARELY OFFERED--

35:12.641 --> 35:14.143
A SECOND CHANCE.

35:14.143 --> 35:16.145
YOU'RE GOING TO LET EMILY GO

35:16.145 --> 35:18.547
AND YOU'RE GOING
TO LET HER GO TONIGHT.

35:18.547 --> 35:20.789
(grunts)

35:20.789 --> 35:22.521
THANKS.

35:22.521 --> 35:24.193
(indistinct conversations)

35:24.193 --> 35:25.424
(camera shutter clicks)

35:25.424 --> 35:27.856
EXCUSE ME. COULD YOU TELL ME
HOW TO GET BACKSTAGE?

35:27.856 --> 35:30.199
SORRY, MISS. SENIOR STAFF
AND FAMILY ONLY.

35:30.199 --> 35:31.600
WELL, I'M BASICALLY FAMILY.
I'M MARRYING CONRAD'S SON.

35:31.600 --> 35:33.302
EMILY THORNE.

35:33.302 --> 35:36.205
(static crackles)
 COULD I GET A V.I.P. CHECK
ON EMILY THORNE?

35:36.205 --> 35:38.437
(indistinct conversations
continue)

35:38.437 --> 35:40.409
(man) Yes, she's on the list.

35:40.409 --> 35:42.471
WAIT HERE.

35:42.471 --> 35:43.812
SOMEBODY WILL BE RIGHT OUT
TO TAKE YOU BACK.

35:43.812 --> 35:45.714
GREAT. THANKS.

35:45.714 --> 35:47.246
(line rings)

35:47.246 --> 35:49.178
It's Nolan.
 You oughta know what to do.

35:49.178 --> 35:50.249
(beep)
 (sighs)

35:50.249 --> 35:51.850
(indistinct conversations
continue)

35:51.850 --> 35:55.624
WHEN DID YOU FIRST CONCEIVE
THE CARRION PROGRAM?

35:55.624 --> 35:58.927
WAS IT DURING ONE OF
YOUR 38 DOCUMENTED PRISON VISITS

35:58.927 --> 36:00.359
WITH DAVID CLARKE?

36:02.861 --> 36:05.864
LOOK, THE BETTER QUESTION TO ASK

36:05.864 --> 36:07.696
IS WHO

36:07.696 --> 36:09.268
UNLEASHED CARRION,

36:09.268 --> 36:10.769
AND WHY.

36:10.769 --> 36:14.703
AND THE PERSON TO ANSWER THAT
WOULD BE ONE EDITH LEE.

36:14.703 --> 36:18.207
BETTER KNOWN IN TERROR-FOR-PAY
CYBER CIRCLES AS THE FALC0N.

36:18.207 --> 36:20.409
THE FALC0N, AS YOU CALL HER,

36:20.409 --> 36:21.880
DENIED INVOLVEMENT.

36:21.880 --> 36:23.252
SAID IT WAS ALL YOU.

36:23.252 --> 36:24.413
OF COURSE SHE DID.

36:24.413 --> 36:26.555
HER PAYCHECKS ARE SIGNED
BY THE INITIATIVE.

36:26.555 --> 36:28.257
I BELIEVE YOU'VE HEARD
OF THEM.

36:28.257 --> 36:29.918
THEY WERE THE ONES
THAT STOLE THE PROGRAM

36:29.918 --> 36:32.190
AND KIDNAPPED...

36:32.190 --> 36:33.862
AND KILLED MY GIRLFRIEND--

36:33.862 --> 36:35.324
PADMA LAHARI.

36:35.324 --> 36:37.195
INFORMATION THAT
WOULD'VE COME IN HANDY

36:37.195 --> 36:39.798
DURING THE INVESTIGATION
INTO MS. LAHARI'S DISAPPEARANCE.

36:39.798 --> 36:43.402
SO... EITHER YOU WERE
WITHHOLDING THEN

36:43.402 --> 36:45.404
OR YOU'RE LYING NOW.

36:45.404 --> 36:47.536
(key clicks)

36:48.777 --> 36:51.610
MY NAME IS PADMA LAHARI,

36:51.610 --> 36:54.713
AND I AM THE FORMER C.F.O.
 OF NOLCORP.

36:54.713 --> 36:58.347
OVER THE PAST SEVERAL MONTHS
 OF MY EMPLOYMENT,

36:58.347 --> 37:00.249
I AM ASHAMED TO SAY

37:00.249 --> 37:02.251
THAT I ENGAGED
 IN AN INTIMATE RELATIONSHIP

37:02.251 --> 37:06.255
WITH THE COMPANY'S FOUNDER
 AND C.E.O.

37:06.255 --> 37:08.226
WE HAVE SOME BREAKING
 ELECTION NEWS COMING IN.

37:08.226 --> 37:10.529
WITH 50 OF 62 COUNTIES
 REPORTING,

37:10.529 --> 37:11.900
WE NOW PROJECT

37:11.900 --> 37:14.363
THAT INDEPENDENT CHALLENGER
 CONRAD GRAYSON

37:14.363 --> 37:16.635
WILL DEFEAT INCUMBENT...
 (cheering)

37:16.635 --> 37:18.667
MARK STODDARD FOR
 THE GOVERNORSHIP OF NEW YORK.

37:18.667 --> 37:20.008
EMILY,
SORRY TO KEEP YOU WAITING.

37:20.008 --> 37:22.240
WHERE'S JACK?
 STILL MISSING, LAST I HEARD.

37:22.240 --> 37:23.542
WE'RE ALL
QUITE WORRIED ABOUT HIM.

37:23.542 --> 37:25.243
DON'T PLAY GAMES WITH ME.

37:25.243 --> 37:27.946
I KNOW THAT YOU TWO ARE
WORKING TOGETHER TO STOP CONRAD.

37:27.946 --> 37:29.778
DECLAN'S DEAD, ASHLEY,

37:29.778 --> 37:31.720
KILLED BY AN EXPLOSION
THAT WAS MEANT FOR JACK.

37:31.720 --> 37:34.553
IF YOU KNOW WHERE HE IS,
YOU NEED TO TELL ME NOW.

37:34.553 --> 37:37.025
THERE'S A TAPE OF CONRAD
AND NATE CONSPIRING TOGETHER.

37:37.025 --> 37:39.628
I WAS GOING TO PLAY IT DURING
CONRAD'S ACCEPTANCE SPEECH.

37:39.628 --> 37:40.789
I GAVE JACK A PRESS PASS

37:40.789 --> 37:41.930
SO HE COULD WITNESS
CONRAD'S HUMILIATION.

37:41.930 --> 37:43.492
JACK'S NOT HERE TO SEE
CONRAD HUMILIATED.

37:43.492 --> 37:44.833
HE'S HERE TO KILL HIM.

37:44.833 --> 37:46.995
WHATEVER YOU DO,
DON'T LET CONRAD ON THAT PODIUM.

37:46.995 --> 37:50.268
(Padma) NOLAN ROSS
 IS THE BLIND DISCIPLE

37:50.268 --> 37:51.470
OF DAVID CLARKE,

37:51.470 --> 37:54.843
A TRULY EVIL MAN
 WITH THE POWER AND MEANS

37:54.843 --> 37:58.507
TO EXECUTE HIS JUDGMENT
 ON THE REST OF US.

37:58.507 --> 38:00.609
HE IS AN ANARCHIST.

38:00.609 --> 38:02.581
HE IS A GENIUS.

38:02.581 --> 38:05.854
NOLAN ROSS IS
 AMERICON INITIATIVE.

38:05.854 --> 38:07.285
(exhales)

38:11.790 --> 38:13.892
CONGRATULATIONS,
GOVERNOR.

38:13.892 --> 38:15.424
IT'S OFFICIAL.

38:15.424 --> 38:17.526
OH, CONGRATULATIONS TO YOU,
MS. DAVENPORT.

38:17.526 --> 38:18.997
THANK YOU.

38:18.997 --> 38:20.899
I IMAGINE YOU ARE
MORE THAN EAGER

38:20.899 --> 38:23.902
TO BEGIN REAPING THE REWARDS
FOR YOUR LOYALTY.

38:23.902 --> 38:27.636
YOU CAN'T GO OUT THERE
JUST YET.

38:27.636 --> 38:29.708
IT WOULDN'T LOOK RIGHT
WITHOUT YOUR FAMILY

38:29.708 --> 38:30.909
STANDING BEHIND YOU.

38:30.909 --> 38:33.081
OH, WELL, I'M FULLY PREPARED
TO EXPLAIN THAT.

38:33.081 --> 38:36.815
ANY WORD ON THE WHEREABOUTS
OF JACK PORTER?

38:36.815 --> 38:38.086
NONE.

38:38.086 --> 38:40.449
I'M ASSUMING YOU HEARD
ABOUT HIS BROTHER'S PASSING?

38:40.449 --> 38:43.692
WELL, YES, YEAH.
IT'S... IT'S TERRIBLE NEWS.

38:43.692 --> 38:45.754
YOU KNOW, I'VE JUST FINISHED
MODIFYING MY SPEECH

38:45.754 --> 38:48.897
TO INCLUDE A MOMENT OF SILENCE
FOR THE BOY.

38:48.897 --> 38:51.860
I DOUBT THERE'LL BE
A DRY EYE IN THE HOUSE.

38:53.862 --> 38:55.934
YOU NEVER MISS A TRICK,
DO YOU?

38:55.934 --> 39:00.008
YOU DON'T GET TO WHERE WE ARE
BY IGNORING OPPORTUNITY.

39:02.040 --> 39:03.812
NO, I SUPPOSE YOU DON'T.

39:06.014 --> 39:08.076
WELL, THEN I THINK
THAT YOU'RE ALL SET.

39:08.076 --> 39:10.719
I'LL LET EVERYONE KNOW.
 THANK YOU.

39:10.719 --> 39:12.521
(elevator bell dings)

39:14.753 --> 39:17.756
DANIEL, HOW KIND OF YOU
TO SHOW YOUR SUPPORT.

39:17.756 --> 39:19.858
I NEED TO BORROW A SHIRT.

39:19.858 --> 39:21.830
YEAH, HELP YOURSELF.

39:21.830 --> 39:23.432
(cell phone rings)

39:23.432 --> 39:26.895
(ring, beep)

39:26.895 --> 39:29.097
GOVERNOR.

39:29.097 --> 39:31.039
(elevator doors close)

39:35.043 --> 39:37.806
(man, amplified voice)
 LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,

39:37.806 --> 39:39.908
YOUR NEXT GOVERNOR
 OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK--

39:39.908 --> 39:42.511
CONRAD GRAYSON!

39:42.511 --> 39:44.513
(cheering)

39:44.513 --> 39:46.755
(amplified voice) THANK YOU.

39:52.891 --> 39:56.865
(cheering continues)

39:56.865 --> 39:59.027
THANK YOU!

39:59.027 --> 40:00.168
(camera shutters clicking)

40:00.168 --> 40:04.002
I JUST RECEIVED
A VERY GRACIOUS PHONE CALL

40:04.002 --> 40:05.904
FROM GOVERNOR STODDARD...

40:05.904 --> 40:07.906
(cheering)

40:07.906 --> 40:09.778
IN WHICH HE CONGRATULATED ME

40:09.778 --> 40:12.541
ON THE TREMENDOUS HONOR
BESTOWED UPON ME

40:12.541 --> 40:14.783
BY THE STATE OF NEW YORK
THIS EVENING!

40:14.783 --> 40:17.816
(cheering)

40:17.816 --> 40:19.518
THANK YOU.

40:19.518 --> 40:24.623
BUT BEFORE I EXPRESS
MY PROFOUND GRATITUDE,

40:24.623 --> 40:27.896
I'D LIKE TO SET ASIDE POLITICS

40:27.896 --> 40:30.659
IN LIEU OF HUMANITY
FOR A MOMENT

40:30.659 --> 40:33.662
AND ACKNOWLEDGE THE LOSS
OF AN EXTRAORDINARY YOUNG MAN--

40:33.662 --> 40:36.835
MR. DECLAN PORTER.

40:36.835 --> 40:39.437
HE'S THE BROTHER
 TO THE HERO OF MY CAMPAIGN--

JACK PORTER--

40:40.909 --> 40:43.441
AND A DEAR FRIEND
 TO MY DAUGHTER CHARLOTTE,

40:43.441 --> 40:47.776
WHOM MY WIFE IS AT HOME
 COMFORTING AT THIS MOMENT.
 (thunder rumbling)

40:47.776 --> 40:49.978
VICTORIA, CHARLOTTE,
 MY HEART IS WITH YOU.

40:49.978 --> 40:52.481
(doorbell rings)

41:00.028 --> 41:02.931
CAN I HELP YOU?

41:02.931 --> 41:05.033
(thunderclap)

41:05.033 --> 41:06.194
(thunderclap)

41:06.194 --> 41:07.996
PATRICK?

41:07.996 --> 41:10.038
HELLO, MOTHER.
 (gasps)

41:13.241 --> 41:15.904
YOU KNOW, FOLKS, LET'S NOT
LET DECLAN PORTER'S DEATH

41:15.904 --> 41:18.246
SIMPLY REMIND US OF THE COWARDS

41:18.246 --> 41:21.610
WHO ARE RESPONSIBLE
FOR THE ATTACKS ON OUR CITY.
 (click)

41:21.610 --> 41:24.983
LET US RATHER SEE HIS SACRIFICE
AS AN INSPIRATION--

41:24.983 --> 41:29.117
AN INSPIRATION TO FACE
OUR OWN UNCERTAIN FUTURE

41:29.117 --> 41:31.920
WITH STRENGTH AND UNITY,

41:31.920 --> 41:34.723
BECAUSE ONE THING IS CERTAIN.

41:34.723 --> 41:38.967
THANKS TO THE COURAGEOUS RESOLVE
OF THE PEOPLE OF NEW YORK,

41:38.967 --> 41:42.531
I WILL BE LEADING US
INTO THE MOST EXCITING FUTURE

41:42.531 --> 41:44.072
THIS STATE HAS EVER KNOWN!

41:44.072 --> 41:47.806
(cheering)

41:47.806 --> 41:48.977
JACK, DON'T DO IT.

41:48.977 --> 41:50.739
THANK YOU!

41:50.739 --> 41:53.111
EMILY, GO AWAY. THIS HAS
NOTHING TO DO WITH YOU.

41:53.111 --> 41:55.043
(crying) IT HAS EVERYTHING
TO DO WITH ME.

41:55.043 --> 41:58.046
IF I HAD ONLY LEFT YOU ALONE
FROM THE BEGINNING,

41:58.046 --> 41:59.648
NONE OF THIS
WOULD BE HAPPENING.

41:59.648 --> 42:00.989
(crowd cheering)

42:00.989 --> 42:02.290
DON'T THROW YOUR LIFE AWAY

42:02.290 --> 42:04.923
BECAUSE OF THE CHOICES
THAT I'VE MADE.

42:04.923 --> 42:07.255
WHAT CHOICES?
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

42:07.255 --> 42:10.298
JACK, LOOK AT ME.

42:10.298 --> 42:12.931
(cheering continues)

42:15.063 --> 42:17.966
DEEP DOWN INSIDE,
YOU'VE ALWAYS KNOWN THE TRUTH.

42:23.071 --> 42:24.943
I'M AMANDA CLARKE.
