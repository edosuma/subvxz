WEBVTT

00:06.074 --> 00:09.510
"MELISSA & JOEY" IS RECORDED IN
FRONT OF A LIVE STUDIO AUDIENCE.

00:09.543 --> 00:12.180
- WHOA!
- Mel: GUYS, SHH! HOLD IT DOWN.

00:12.213 --> 00:15.316
Mel: SO WHAT DID THE DOCTOR SAY?
GONE JUST LIKE THAT, HUH?

00:15.349 --> 00:18.186
ALL RIGHT. YEAH, I'LL BREAK
THE NEWS TO THE OFFICE.

00:18.219 --> 00:20.188
YEAH, GO AHEAD,
SEND HIM FLOWERS.

00:20.221 --> 00:22.456
SOMETHING CHEAP. I NEVER
REALLY LIKED THE GUY.

00:22.490 --> 00:25.359
A LITTLE RESPECT FOR
THE DEAD, BURKE.

00:25.393 --> 00:28.429
NOTHING DIED EXCEPT OUR SOFTBALL
TEAM'S SHOT AT THE TROPHY.

00:28.462 --> 00:31.199
OUR INTERN BRIAN BROKE HIS
ARM, OR HIS LEG OR SOMETHING.

00:31.232 --> 00:34.135
YOU KNOW WHAT HE BROKE? HE BROKE MY
HEART BECAUSE HE'S NOT PLAYING NOW.

00:34.168 --> 00:36.237
YOUR FIRST BASEMAN? HE
WAS YOUR BEST PLAYER.

00:36.270 --> 00:38.272
YOU'VE GOT NO TEAM WITHOUT HIM.

00:40.141 --> 00:41.575
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?

00:41.609 --> 00:45.079
LOSE BADLY AND OFTEN.

00:45.113 --> 00:48.382
- JOE, DIDN'T YOU PLAY FIRST BASE IN COLLEGE?
- NO, I DID NOT.

00:48.416 --> 00:51.185
YOU TOLD ME YOU WERE M.V.P.
TWO YEARS IN A ROW.

00:51.219 --> 00:54.155
THREE. ( chuckles )

00:54.188 --> 00:57.858
- DAMN.
- HEY, JOE, HOW'D YOU LIKE TO PLAY ON OUR

00:57.891 --> 00:59.527
ONE-GAME-FROM-THE-FINALS
OFFICE SOFTBALL TEAM?

00:59.560 --> 01:01.495
I CAN'T. I DON'T
WORK IN YOUR OFFICE.

01:01.529 --> 01:03.164
IT'S THE GOVERNMENT.
NO ONE CHECKS.

01:03.197 --> 01:05.199
NO ONE BALANCES. NO ONE CARES.

01:05.233 --> 01:07.401
THERE'S NO WAY I'M PLAYING
FOR THE "BAD NEWS BURKES."

01:07.435 --> 01:09.570
OH PLEASE, I WOULD NEVER COME
UP WITH A NAME THAT LAME.

01:09.603 --> 01:12.273
WE'RE CALLED "MEL'S ANGELS."

01:12.306 --> 01:14.342
- IS THERE SWAG?
- LIKE WHAT?

01:14.375 --> 01:16.610
I DON'T KNOW... A
WATCH, A MOUNTAIN BIKE,

01:16.644 --> 01:18.412
A SPA GIFT BAG.

01:18.446 --> 01:21.182
YOU'D GET A PROFOUND
SENSE OF SATISFACTION.

01:21.215 --> 01:23.484
- I WAS BORN WITH THAT.
- JOE!

01:23.517 --> 01:25.886
FORGET IT, ALL RIGHT? THERE'S NO
WAY YOU'RE TALKING ME INTO THIS.

01:25.919 --> 01:28.522
AND MEL'S ANGELS IS ONE
WIN AWAY FROM THE TROPHY!

01:28.556 --> 01:30.624
- WHOO-HOO!
- WHOO! THANKS TO THE MIGHTY BAT

01:30.658 --> 01:33.627
OF MY FIRST BASEMAN,
JOE "LONGBALL" LONGO.

01:33.661 --> 01:35.529
NOT TO MENTION THE AMAZING
UNASSISTED DOUBLE PLAY

01:35.563 --> 01:38.466
- BY THE SECOND BASEMAN IN THE SEVENTH INNING.
- YEAH. DID YOU ENJOY

01:38.499 --> 01:40.401
- MY UNASSISTED DOUBLE-PLAY DANCE?
- I'M A LITTLE HAZY ON IT.

01:40.434 --> 01:41.635
- HOW DID THAT GO AGAIN?
- LIKE THIS.

01:41.669 --> 01:43.571
- OH, LIKE... OKAY.
- MM-HMM, ALL RIGHT, JOE.

01:43.604 --> 01:46.340
- LITTLE HIP, OKAY.
- GO, LONGO. GO, LONGO.

01:46.374 --> 01:47.541
IT'S SO GROSS WHEN
THEY GET ALONG.

01:47.575 --> 01:49.610
DON'T LOOK AT IT.

01:49.643 --> 01:52.346
NOW AREN'T YOU GLAD I TALKED
YOU INTO JOINING THE TEAM?

01:52.380 --> 01:53.647
WAIT A MINUTE. BACK UP. YOU
DIDN'T TALK ME INTO IT.

01:53.681 --> 01:55.583
YOU TOLD ME THE PLUSSES AND MINUSES.
I MADE MY OWN DECISION.

01:55.616 --> 01:57.218
YEAH, AFTER I
TALKED YOU INTO IT.

01:57.251 --> 01:58.552
YOU'RE UNBELIEVABLE.
EVERYTHING'S GOTTA BE YOUR WAY.

01:58.586 --> 02:00.521
WELL, I LIKE THINGS
THE CORRECT WAY,

02:00.554 --> 02:02.290
- WHICH JUST HAPPENS TO BE MY WAY.
- ( groans )

02:02.323 --> 02:04.392
YAY, THEY'RE BACK.

02:04.425 --> 02:05.559
( theme music playing )

02:05.593 --> 02:08.629
♪ I GUESS YOU'RE STUCK ♪

02:08.662 --> 02:11.465
♪ WITH ME ♪

02:14.635 --> 02:16.370
ALL RIGHT, GUYS, WE'VE
GOT A LOT AT STAKE HERE.

02:16.404 --> 02:18.639
THE PEOPLE OF DISTRICT SEVEN
ELECTED US FOR A REASON...

02:18.672 --> 02:21.542
TO WIN THE SOFTBALL
LEAGUE TROPHY.

02:21.575 --> 02:23.311
Stephanie: WHOO!

02:23.344 --> 02:25.646
ALL RIGHT. NOW I KNOW
WE'VE GOT BUDGET GAPS,

02:25.679 --> 02:27.548
AND LIBRARIES CLOSING,
BUT THIS IS SOMETHING

02:27.581 --> 02:29.417
WE CAN ACTUALLY SUCCEED AT.

02:29.450 --> 02:31.485
NOW WE WERE THIS CLOSE
TO WINNING LAST YEAR

02:31.519 --> 02:33.221
WHEN IT WAS SNATCHED
OUT FROM UNDER US

02:33.254 --> 02:35.323
BY THE COUNCILMAN WHO
SHALL NOT BE NAMED.

02:35.356 --> 02:38.192
HANCOCK. HERBERT HANCOCK.

02:38.226 --> 02:40.661
COUNCILWOMAN BURKE.

02:40.694 --> 02:42.630

PLEASURE TO SEE YOU.

02:48.769 --> 02:52.440
ATHLETIC SPECIMENS
IS "LONGBALL" LONGO?

02:54.442 --> 02:57.378
- HE'S NOT HERE.
- HOW CONVENIENT.

02:57.411 --> 02:58.646
PEOPLE LEAVE THEIR
OFFICES ALL THE TIME.

02:58.679 --> 03:00.614
IF I WENT TO YOUR OFFICE
RIGHT NOW, YOU'D BE OUT.

03:00.648 --> 03:02.283
THAT'S HOW IT IS WITH JOE TOO.

03:02.316 --> 03:05.319
I SEE. WHAT EXACTLY
DOES THIS JOE LONGO DO?

03:05.353 --> 03:08.756
- HE'S MEL'S NAN...
HE'S MY OFFICE MANAGER.

03:08.789 --> 03:11.592
SO IF I COME BACK I'LL SEE HIM?
R TOMORROW,

03:11.625 --> 03:14.228
I'VE SEEN HIM MANY
MANY TIMES WORKING.

03:14.262 --> 03:15.596
HERE. DOING HIS JOB.

03:15.629 --> 03:17.331
- MANAGING THINGS.
- AHEM.

03:17.365 --> 03:18.799
I LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING HIM.

03:20.801 --> 03:24.605
- JOE DOESN'T WORK HERE.
- OR DOES HE?

03:24.638 --> 03:26.607
- ( phone rings )
- OH, I'LL GET THAT.

03:26.640 --> 03:28.509
COUNCILWOMAN BURKE'S OFFICE.

03:28.542 --> 03:30.678
I'M ANSWERING THE NEXT ONE.

03:32.045 --> 03:33.614
HEY, HOW'S EVERYTHING
GOING HERE?

03:33.647 --> 03:35.783
GOOD GOOD GOOD. OUT
OF MY MIND.TLE BORED

03:35.816 --> 03:37.518
DO ME A FAVOR... IN THE FACE?
NCH ME

03:37.551 --> 03:39.753
- I WANT TO FEEL SOMETHING.
- OH, COME ON.

03:39.787 --> 03:42.656
IN TWO HOURS WE'RE IN
PARKING ENFORCEMENT.

03:42.690 --> 03:44.525
CA... YOU JUST HAD CAKE.

03:44.558 --> 03:45.726
NO, THAT WAS FOR NATHAN
IN ANIMAL CONTROL,

03:45.759 --> 03:47.495
AND IT WAS BEFORE LUNCH.

03:47.528 --> 03:50.398
THIS ONE'S TOTALLY DIFFERENT...
IT'S GONNA BE YELLOW.

03:50.431 --> 03:52.500
- YOU KNOW WHAT? I'M GONNA GO HOME.
- NO NO NO NO NO.

03:52.533 --> 03:53.801
COME ON, WE'LL FIND
SOMETHING FOR YOU TO DO.

03:53.834 --> 03:57.438
OKAY, YOU WERE MY CLOSET
AT HOME.RGANIZING

03:57.471 --> 03:59.607
WE HAVE A REALLY MESSY
CLOSET HERE TOO.

03:59.640 --> 04:01.609
NAH, I DON'T WANNA ORGANIZE IT.

04:01.642 --> 04:03.043
WHAT KIND OF CLOSET IS IT?

04:03.076 --> 04:04.612
A HUGE SUPPLY CLOSET.

04:04.645 --> 04:06.447
COME ON, IT'S A DISASTER.

04:06.480 --> 04:07.581
NO ONE CAN FIND
ANYTHING IN THERE.

04:07.615 --> 04:09.617
I GUESS IT WOULDN'T
HURT TO TAKE A LOOK.

04:09.650 --> 04:11.719
GO TEAM.

04:15.556 --> 04:17.791
- HEY, LENNOX.
- HEY, HOLLY.

04:19.660 --> 04:22.796
WELL, THAT'S ODD. MY
SHORT STORY.SHE LOVED

04:22.830 --> 04:24.598
YOU GAVE IT TO HER, RIGHT?

04:24.632 --> 04:27.267
WELL, OF COURSE, BUT NOT YET.

04:28.569 --> 04:30.471
YOU SEE, AS EDITOR OF
THE LITERARY BLOG,

04:30.504 --> 04:32.606
SHE'S REALLY BUSY AND
IMPOSSIBLE TO TRACK DOWN.

04:32.640 --> 04:34.608
MAYBE THE GIRL WHO JUST
WENT IN THE KITCHEN

04:34.642 --> 04:35.743
KNOWS WHERE YOU CAN FIND HER.

04:37.478 --> 04:39.580
IT'D BE A SHAME IF MY
STORY DIDN'T GET POSTED

04:39.613 --> 04:41.415
AND THINGS GOT WEIRD BETWEEN US.

04:41.449 --> 04:42.583
REALLY, THAT COULD HAPPEN?

04:42.616 --> 04:44.485
THAT COULD HAPPEN.

04:46.420 --> 04:48.088
- BE RIGHT BACK.
- ( chuckles )

04:48.121 --> 04:49.623
THANKS, SQUEAKY MOUSE.

04:51.759 --> 04:54.528
HEY, I MEANT TO GIVE YOU THIS.

04:54.562 --> 04:57.865
IT HAS HOLLY'S SHORT STORY FOR EXCLUSIVE
PUBLICATION IN "THE GRANT RANT."

04:57.898 --> 05:01.702
SHE COULD'VE TAKEN IT ANYWHERE,
BUT SHE CAME TO YOU FIRST.

05:02.603 --> 05:04.071
SERIOUSLY?

05:04.104 --> 05:05.473
YOU THINK I'M GONNA
PUBLISH HER STORY

05:05.506 --> 05:07.475
JUST BECAUSE YOU
TWO ARE GOING OUT?

05:07.508 --> 05:09.810
BUT IT'S REALLY GOOD.

05:09.843 --> 05:11.679
OH, SO YOU'VE READ IT.

05:11.712 --> 05:13.881
I'M AFRAID TO...

05:15.416 --> 05:16.717
'CAUSE I MAY NOT LIKE IT

05:16.750 --> 05:18.919
AND I THINK SHE CAN
READ MY THOUGHTS.

05:20.521 --> 05:22.623
YOU ARE TRULY SAD.

05:22.656 --> 05:24.925
BUT SAD WITH A GIRLFRIEND.

05:26.627 --> 05:29.863
WHO WANTS A FROSTED
PIECE OF HEAVEN?

05:29.897 --> 05:32.633
BURKE, DISASTER AVERTED.

05:32.666 --> 05:34.768
LOOK WHAT I FOUND...
TYPEWRITER RIBBON.

05:34.802 --> 05:38.672
YEAH, I'M GONNA DONATE THIS TO THE
MUSEUM OF CRAP THAT NO ONE USES ANYMORE.

05:39.940 --> 05:42.743
CAKE, JOE? I SAVED
YOU HALF MY FLOWER.

05:45.446 --> 05:46.547
THANK YOU, STEPHANIE.

05:46.580 --> 05:49.650
SO THIS IS THE YELLOW CAKE
I'VE HEARD SO MUCH ABOUT?

05:49.683 --> 05:52.653
JOE, THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT
FOR OFFICE MORALE.

05:52.686 --> 05:54.622
YEAH, 'CAUSE NOTHING BRINGS
AN OFFICE TOGETHER LIKE...

05:54.655 --> 05:55.856
FAT AND CHOLESTEROL.

05:57.425 --> 05:58.926
DING-DONG. I SMELL CAKE.

05:58.959 --> 06:02.663
COUNCILMAN HANCOCK, I'D
LIKE YOU TO MEET JOE LONGO.

06:02.696 --> 06:04.898
SURPRISED TO SEE
YOU HERE, LONGO.

06:04.932 --> 06:06.934
WHY WOULD YOU BE SURPRISED?
HE WORKS HERE, DON'T YOU?

06:06.967 --> 06:09.703
- YES, I DO.
- AND YOU'RE THE OFFICE MANAGER, RIGHT?

06:09.737 --> 06:11.672
THAT'S WHAT THEY TELL ME.

06:11.705 --> 06:13.674
YOU MUST KNOW YOUR WAY AROUND.

06:13.707 --> 06:16.176
TELL ME THIS... IF I WANTED
TO WALK DOWN THE HALL

06:16.209 --> 06:17.978
TO THE MEN'S ROOM, WHICH
WAY WOULD I TURN?

06:19.647 --> 06:22.616
TO THE RIGHT AND
DOWN THE STAIRS.

06:23.851 --> 06:25.586
OH, AND STALL NUMBER
THREE IS OUT OF ORDER.

06:25.619 --> 06:26.920
DO NOT GO IN THERE.

06:28.489 --> 06:30.424
YOU WIN THIS ROUND, LONGO.

06:30.458 --> 06:32.593
BUT I'LL BE BACK...

06:32.626 --> 06:34.495
MAYBE TOMORROW,
MAYBE THE NEXT DAY.

06:34.528 --> 06:36.664
YOU NEVER KNOW WHEN
I MIGHT SHOW UP.

06:38.866 --> 06:41.702
- OH, THAT WENT GREAT.
- GREAT? WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

06:41.735 --> 06:43.571
HE SAID HE COULD COME
BACK AT ANY TIME.

06:43.604 --> 06:45.673
OH, DON'T WORRY. HE ONLY COMES
BACK WHEN THERE'S CAKE.

06:45.706 --> 06:48.609
YOU... YOU HAVE
CAKE TWICE A DAY.

06:48.642 --> 06:53.447
- I GUESS YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO STAY HERE THE WHOLE WEEK.
- UH, DOING WHAT EXACTLY?

06:53.481 --> 06:56.517
I WAS JUST IN THE SUPPLY CLOSET
LOOKING FOR A BLUE HIGHLIGHTER,

06:56.550 --> 06:59.853
AND THERE IT WAS ON A
SHELF WITH A LABEL.

06:59.887 --> 07:02.456
HOW DID THAT HAPPEN?

07:02.490 --> 07:05.626
JUST A LITTLE ANGEL NAMED JOE.

07:05.659 --> 07:07.728
- WHOO!
- COME ON, NOW.

07:07.761 --> 07:09.463
I DIDN'T DO IT FOR THE PRAISE.

07:09.497 --> 07:11.231
I JUST DID WHAT ANYONE ELSE
WOULD'VE DONE IN THERE.

07:11.264 --> 07:13.934
- WAY TO GO, LONGBALL.
- ( chuckles )

07:27.548 --> 07:29.850
- SO WHAT'S FOR DINNER?
- BREAKFAST.

07:31.619 --> 07:33.687
SO YOU READ HOLLY'S SHORT STORY,

07:33.721 --> 07:35.589
YOU LOVED IT AND YOU'RE
GONNA PUBLISH IT, RIGHT?

07:35.623 --> 07:36.924
PLEASE SAY YES.

07:38.626 --> 07:39.893
THE STORY'S MISSING SOME THINGS.

07:39.927 --> 07:42.563
- LIKE WHAT?
- A BEGINNING,

07:42.596 --> 07:44.665
A MIDDLE, AN END.

07:44.698 --> 07:47.267
BUT OTHER THAN THAT, IT SUCKS.

07:47.300 --> 07:50.538
I'M SORRY, BUT I RUN
A LITERARY BLOG

07:50.571 --> 07:51.872
- AND WE HAVE STANDARDS.
- COME ON.

07:51.905 --> 07:53.907
I'M ALREADY ON
BOYFRIEND PROBATION.

07:53.941 --> 07:55.943
I'M JUST SAYING IT'S SILLY
FOR ME TO BE SITTING THERE

07:55.976 --> 07:57.645
ALL WEEK LONG WITH
NOTHING IMPORTANT TO DO.

07:57.678 --> 07:59.513
BUT YOU DID A HELL OF A
JOB IN THE SUPPLY CLOSET.

07:59.547 --> 08:00.514
OH, THAT WAS A CLOSET.

08:00.548 --> 08:04.051
ALBEIT A VERY CHALLENGING
CLOSET, BUT STILL,

08:04.084 --> 08:05.686
I NEED SOMETHING
WORTHY OF MY SKILLS.

08:05.719 --> 08:08.522
- WHAT'S THAT?
- WELL, THAT'S MY DINNER.

08:08.556 --> 08:10.958
- IT'S PRETTY GOOD.
- OH. GIVE ME THREE MINUTES,

08:10.991 --> 08:12.660
I'LL HAVE SOMETHING
HOT ON THE TABLE.

08:12.693 --> 08:15.596
AUNT MEL, WOULD YOU
PLEASE READ HOLLY'S STORY

08:15.629 --> 08:17.064
- AND TELL LENNOX HOW GOOD IT IS?
- OH NO NO.

08:17.097 --> 08:18.766
I'M NOT GETTING IN
THE MIDDLE OF THAT.

08:18.799 --> 08:21.569
THAT LITTLE PIT BULL
SCARES THE HELL OUT OF ME.

08:21.602 --> 08:23.971
I MEAN, NOT IN A BAD WAY. SHE'S SWEET.
I LOVE HER.

08:25.005 --> 08:26.807
I'LL SAVE YOU THE TROUBLE.

08:26.840 --> 08:30.077
- THE STORY'S NOT GOOD.
- YOU NEVER DO ANYTHING FOR ME.

08:30.110 --> 08:33.013
I MADE YOU DINNER.

08:33.046 --> 08:36.016
ALL RIGHT, FINE. I'D BE WILLING
TO SIT DOWN WITH HOLLY

08:36.049 --> 08:39.019
AND WORK THROUGH THE STORY TO SEE IF
WE CAN'T MAKE IT BARELY PASSABLE.

08:39.052 --> 08:42.556
THAT'S ALL I'M ASKING. I'M
SURE SHE'D BE OPEN TO THAT.

08:42.590 --> 08:44.625
OH HEY, JOE, BEFORE I FORGET,

08:44.658 --> 08:47.327
EVERYBODY'S GOT TO BE IN TOMORROW AT
8:00 FOR A SEXUAL HARASSMENT SEMINAR.

08:47.360 --> 08:49.296
OH, THE GUY WHO DOES IT
HAS THE CUTEST BUTT.

08:49.329 --> 08:51.699
YOU JUST WANT TO GRAB IT.

08:51.732 --> 08:52.866
YOU'RE REALLY PUTTING
A LOT OF EMPHASIS

08:52.900 --> 08:53.967
ON WINNING THIS STUPID LITTLE
TROPHY, YOU KNOW THAT?

08:54.001 --> 08:57.938
IT'S A BIG TROPHY, OKAY?
IT'S BIGGER THAN STEPHANIE.

08:57.971 --> 09:00.841
YOU DO REALIZE I'M NOT ACTUALLY
YOUR OFFICE MANAGER, THOUGH, RIGHT?

09:00.874 --> 09:02.976
BUT YOU COULD BE.

09:03.010 --> 09:05.679
AS OF TOMORROW, I AM RELEASING
ALL OF YOUR LONGO-NESS.

09:05.713 --> 09:07.114
YOU ARE COMPLETELY IN CHARGE.

09:07.147 --> 09:09.583
- I'M GONNA BE OFFICE MANAGER?
- THE WHOLE WEEK.

09:09.617 --> 09:11.619
I DO HAVE SOME IDEAS ABOUT
INCREASING EFFICIENCY AROUND THERE.

09:11.652 --> 09:12.886
LISTEN TO YOU, ALL EFFICIENCY.

09:12.920 --> 09:15.623
"JOE LONGO, EXECUTIVE NINJA."

09:15.656 --> 09:18.091
OOH! I LIKE THAT.

09:20.961 --> 09:23.130
HOLLY, YOU DON'T NEED ALL
THIS BACKGROUND INFORMATION.

09:23.163 --> 09:25.633
YOU COULD JUST START THE
STORY ON PAGE THREE.

09:26.767 --> 09:29.369
THE STORY STARTS ON PAGE ONE.

09:29.402 --> 09:32.039
THAT'S WHY IT'S
CALLED "PAGE ONE."

09:32.072 --> 09:34.107
HOW ABOUT WE COMPROMISE
AND START ON PAGE TWO?

09:34.141 --> 09:37.144
NO. WHY ARE YOU GIVING
ME ALL THESE COMMENTS?

09:37.177 --> 09:39.046
RYDER TOLD ME YOU JUST
WANTED TO GET TOGETHER

09:39.079 --> 09:41.782
- TO TELL ME HOW GREAT MY STORY IS.
- WHAT?

09:41.815 --> 09:46.754
WELL, SURE, BUT IF THERE'S SOME
TINY THING THAT COULD BE IMPROVED,

09:46.787 --> 09:48.956
YOU COULD MAKE WHAT IS
GREAT EVEN GREATER.

09:50.057 --> 09:51.358
LIKE WHAT HAPPENED TO MY LIFE

09:51.391 --> 09:53.661
WHEN YOU GOT ADDED TO IT.

09:54.995 --> 09:56.163
YOU KNOW WHAT, RYDER?

09:56.196 --> 09:58.632
I JUST DON'T FEEL
LIKE I HAVE A PARTNER

09:58.666 --> 10:00.634
IN THIS RELATIONSHIP ANYMORE.

10:00.668 --> 10:02.602
ARE YOU BREAKING UP WITH ME?

10:03.804 --> 10:06.406
I THINK IT'S KIND OF MUTUAL.

10:06.439 --> 10:09.042
NO. NO NO NO, DON'T! PLEASE.

10:09.076 --> 10:11.211
THIS IS WHAT'S BEST
FOR ALL OF US.

10:12.412 --> 10:14.648
EXCEPT FOR YOU.

10:15.816 --> 10:17.651
NO, BUT YOUR STORY WAS GREAT

10:17.685 --> 10:20.087
AND I LOVED ALL YOUR
UNNECESSARY BACKGROUND CRAP...

10:20.120 --> 10:22.222
I MEAN GEMS.

10:23.924 --> 10:26.660
- LENNOX, WHAT DID YOU DO?
- WHAT DID I DO?

10:26.694 --> 10:28.829
YOU TOLD ME SHE'D BE
OPEN TO MY FEEDBACK.

10:28.862 --> 10:32.065
- YOU LIED TO BOTH OF US.
- WELL, SURE, WHAT CHOICE DID I HAVE?

10:32.099 --> 10:34.101
WHY DO YOU EVEN PUT
UP WITH HOLLY?

10:35.703 --> 10:37.204
'CAUSE I REALLY LIKE HER.

10:39.873 --> 10:42.943
SEVEN HOURS IN THE POLICE
DEPARTMENT CONFERENCE ROOM.

10:42.976 --> 10:45.445
BAD LIGHTING ANYONE? NOT ONE
OF THOSE COPS HIT ON ME,

10:45.478 --> 10:46.947
PROBABLY BECAUSE OF
THE BAD LIGHTING.

10:46.980 --> 10:50.450
- HOW'S EVERYTHING HERE?
- COULDN'T BE GOING BETTER, BUT IT'S GONNA BE.

10:50.483 --> 10:52.052
I CAME UP WITH A REWARD SYSTEM

10:52.085 --> 10:53.987
TO INCREASE CONSTITUENT
CALL VOLUME.

10:54.021 --> 10:56.023
AS LONG AS YOU DIDN'T
HURT YOUR THROWING ARM.

10:56.056 --> 10:58.191
WHAT? NO, THAT'S FINE.
HANCOCK STOPPED BY, THOUGH,

10:58.225 --> 11:00.193
JUST TO SAY HI. YEAH.

11:00.227 --> 11:02.095
OH, I GOTTA GO. I GOTTA
SHOW THE I.T. GUYS

11:02.129 --> 11:03.831
HOW THAT NEW SOFTWARE WORKS.
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

11:03.864 --> 11:07.801
OH, RAJIV, AJAY, LET'S MAKE
THIS HAPPEN, GUYS. COME ON.

11:09.236 --> 11:13.240
DID YOU SEE THAT? MY AMAZING
FIRST BASEMAN/ OFFICE MANAGER

11:13.273 --> 11:16.777
- IS ACTUALLY HAPPY TO BE HERE.
- HE'S THE ONLY ONE. LOOK.

11:16.810 --> 11:19.847
"A MEMO TO ALL STAFF FROM
JOE LONGO, OFFICE MANAGER."

11:19.880 --> 11:22.149
- HOW DID HE GET HIS OWN LETTERHEAD?
- JUST READ.

11:22.182 --> 11:24.985
"TO BOOST EFFICIENCIES AND
ELIMINATE DISTRACTIONS,

11:25.018 --> 11:27.921
ALL OFFICE PERSONNEL ARE HEREBY
BARRED FROM USING FACEBOOK."

11:27.955 --> 11:30.991
- WHAT?!
- I KNOW! I WANTED TO POST HOW UPSET I WAS,

11:31.024 --> 11:33.160
- BUT I COULDN'T.
- "FURTHERMORE,

11:33.193 --> 11:35.262
IN ORDER TO ELIMINATE REDUNDANCIES
IN BIRTHDAY CELEBRATIONS,

11:35.295 --> 11:37.831
OFFICE BIRTHDAYS WILL BE ACCRUED
AND CELEBRATED QUARTERLY."

11:37.865 --> 11:40.267
TODAY IS MY BIRTHDAY.

11:40.300 --> 11:42.736
OF COURSE IT IS, BIRTHDAY GIRL.

11:42.770 --> 11:45.272
THAT'S WHY I GOT YOU...

11:45.305 --> 11:47.274
A SURPRISE.

11:47.307 --> 11:50.143
WELL, NEVER MIND, BECAUSE
I'VE BEEN ACCRUED.

11:50.177 --> 11:52.045
WE'LL BE CELEBRATING
IT IN TWO MONTHS

11:52.079 --> 11:55.749
WITH A CAKE THAT SAYS "HAPPY
BIRTHDAY, ALLS Y'ALL."

11:55.783 --> 11:57.250
DON'T WORRY. YOU ARE GONNA
HAVE YOUR CAKE, LITTLE MISSY.

11:57.284 --> 11:59.286
NEW SPEECH, CHAMBER OF
COMMERCE, WEDNESDAY.

11:59.319 --> 12:01.121
HEY, WYATT, WAIT.
HOW'S YOUR MOM DOING?

12:01.154 --> 12:03.857
- IS SHE OFF THAT HEART-LUNG MACHINE?
- I WOULDN'T KNOW.

12:03.891 --> 12:05.926
- PERSONAL CALLS HAVE BEEN BANNED.
- REALLY?

12:05.959 --> 12:07.928
YEAH. I'VE GOTTA GET BACK

12:07.961 --> 12:10.497
BEFORE WARDEN LONGO NOTICES
I'M AWAY FROM MY POST.

12:10.530 --> 12:12.900
Joe: WYATT, WHY DO I SEE
AN EMPTY DESK OUT HERE?

12:12.933 --> 12:16.069
- GOTTA GO.
- ARE YOU GONNA TALK TO JOE

12:16.103 --> 12:18.071
OR ARE YOU GONNA WEASEL OUT
BECAUSE HE'S THE TICKET

12:18.105 --> 12:20.173
- TO YOUR PRECIOUS SOFTBALL TROPHY?
- DON'T WORRY.

12:20.207 --> 12:22.843
- I'LL TALK TO HIM.
- HEY, I JUST GOT OUT OF THE BREAK ROOM.

12:22.876 --> 12:27.047
DO WE REALLY NEED 17 DIFFERENT
KINDS OF HERBAL TEA IN THERE?

12:27.080 --> 12:29.249
SO, JOE, A LOT OF CHANGES IN
THE LAST COUPLE OF HOURS.

12:29.282 --> 12:31.218
YEAH, IT'S REALLY HUMMING OUT THERE, HUH?
YOU DON'T HAVE TO THANK ME.

12:31.251 --> 12:33.854
- IT JUST FEELS GOOD TO GET MY OFFICE MOJO BACK.
- YEAH, I CAN SEE THAT.

12:33.887 --> 12:36.924
CAN WE GO BIG PICTURE
HERE FOR A MINUTE THOUGH?

12:36.957 --> 12:39.927
ABSOLUTELY. YEAH, I AM ALL
YOURS FOR 60 SECONDS. GO.

12:39.960 --> 12:42.195
OKAY, WELL, YOU KNOW
IT'S A TEAM EFFORT HERE

12:42.229 --> 12:44.331
AND THE CAPTAIN OF THAT
TEAM IS OBVIOUSLY...

12:44.364 --> 12:46.333
ME, THE OFFICE MANAGER.

12:46.366 --> 12:49.803
- ONE MORE GUESS.
- WHAT? YOU?

12:49.837 --> 12:51.872
NO, NOT YOU. YOU'RE
THE TEAM OWNER.

12:51.905 --> 12:53.273
WE'RE ALL DOING THIS FOR YOU.
WE'RE BUSTING OUR BUTTS

12:53.306 --> 12:55.308
TO MAKE MONEY... LOTS OF MONEY.

12:55.342 --> 12:59.346
OR WHATEVER IT IS THAT YOU
GUYS DO HERE IN THIS OFFICE.

12:59.379 --> 13:01.081
IT'S THE GOVERNMENT.

13:01.114 --> 13:03.250
IT'S NOT FOR PROFIT.
IT'S FOR SERVICE.

13:03.283 --> 13:06.086
SO WHEN YOU SEND OUT MEMOS
WITHOUT MY APPROVAL,

13:06.119 --> 13:07.855
ON STATIONERY I DON'T
KNOW HOW YOU GOT,

13:07.888 --> 13:10.257
IT'S... WELL, LET ME
JUST PUT IT THIS WAY...

13:10.290 --> 13:13.026
IT DOESN'T PISS ME ON.

13:14.294 --> 13:17.197
MEL, YOU TOLD ME I COULD MAKE
THIS OFFICE MORE EFFICIENT.

13:17.230 --> 13:19.266
YOU TOLD ME TO UNLEASH
MY EXECUTIVE NINJA.

13:19.299 --> 13:21.835
NOW YOU WANT ME TO JUST
HANDCUFF MY NINJA?

13:21.869 --> 13:23.336
MY NINJA'S NOT GONNA
BE HANDCUFFED.

13:23.370 --> 13:25.305
IF I'M GONNA HANDCUFF MY NINJA,
I MIGHT AS WELL GO HOME.

13:25.338 --> 13:27.074
NO NO NO NO NO! I NEED YOU.

13:27.107 --> 13:29.910
NO, YOU NEED ME TO PLAY
ON THE SOFTBALL TEAM.

13:29.943 --> 13:31.845
NO NO NO, WE NEED YOU
FOR OUR TEAM HERE,

13:31.879 --> 13:33.280
NOT JUST THE SOFTBALL TEAM.

13:33.313 --> 13:35.148
EVERYBODY HERE LOVES YOU.

13:35.182 --> 13:37.851
I MEAN, TRUST ME. I WOULD
TELL YOU IF THEY DIDN'T.

13:37.885 --> 13:39.386
I DON'T KEEP THINGS FROM YOU.

13:39.419 --> 13:44.324
( all whispering ) ♪
HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOU.

13:44.357 --> 13:47.360
- MAKE A WISH, STEPHANIE.
- THERE'S NOT ENOUGH ROOM.

13:47.394 --> 13:50.330
COME ON, BLOW OUT THE CANDLES BEFORE
THE SPRINKLER SYSTEM GOES OFF.

13:53.300 --> 13:55.835
- ( all whisper ) YAY!
- SHH!

14:01.909 --> 14:04.878
( crickets chirping )

14:04.912 --> 14:07.014
HOLLY TEXTED ME. SHE'S
ON HER WAY OVER.

14:07.047 --> 14:08.916
THAT'S A GOOD SIGN,
DON'T YOU THINK?

14:08.949 --> 14:11.952
GOOD SIGN OF THE APOCALYPSE.

14:11.985 --> 14:13.386
I'M SURE SHE'S JUST
RETHINKING THE BREAKUP

14:13.420 --> 14:16.623
AND WANTS TO TALK IT OVER.
OR KILL YOU.

14:16.656 --> 14:18.625
( doorbell chimes )

14:18.658 --> 14:20.928
DO YOU WANT ME TO STAY
AND HELP YOU HANDLE THIS

14:20.961 --> 14:22.095
OR PROVIDE FIRST AID?

14:22.129 --> 14:23.997
NO. NO, THAT'S FINE.

14:26.666 --> 14:28.201
( sighs )

14:29.702 --> 14:33.473
HOLLY. WON'T YOU COME IN
AND BE MY GIRLFRIEND?

14:34.942 --> 14:37.911
RYDER, WE ARE ESTRANGED,

14:37.945 --> 14:39.913
SO I THOUGHT IT
BEST IF I TOOK BACK

14:39.947 --> 14:41.448
CERTAIN MEMENTOS OF
OUR TIME TOGETHER.

14:41.481 --> 14:43.917
WE'LL START WITH THAT SHIRT.

14:43.951 --> 14:47.120
BUT YOU GAVE ME THIS SHIRT.
I LOVE THIS SHIRT.

14:47.154 --> 14:49.990
AND THAT'S WHY WE'RE
STARTING WITH IT.

14:50.023 --> 14:51.091
TAKE IT OFF.

14:51.124 --> 14:53.193
I HOPE YOU HAVE A
T-SHIRT ON UNDERNEATH,

14:53.226 --> 14:55.228
BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO
SEE YOUR BONY STERNUM.

14:56.296 --> 14:58.665
( sighs ) LOOK, I
JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW

14:58.698 --> 15:00.934
THAT LENNOX ISN'T SAYING SHE
WON'T PUBLISH YOUR STORY.

15:00.968 --> 15:03.336
SHE JUST WANTS TO WORK WITH
YOU TO MAKE IT BETTER.

15:03.370 --> 15:05.939
I HATE TO ADMIT IT, BUT MY
SISTER REALLY DOES KNOW

15:05.973 --> 15:07.440
A LOT ABOUT THIS WRITING STUFF.

15:07.474 --> 15:09.076
MAYBE YOU SHOULD LISTEN TO HER.

15:10.978 --> 15:12.379
SHIRT.

15:15.983 --> 15:17.350
( sighs )

15:20.753 --> 15:23.323
I'M JUST GLAD SHE FORGOT
SHE GAVE ME THESE PANTS.

15:29.762 --> 15:30.863
( knocks )

15:30.897 --> 15:33.233
- BURKE, YOU GOT A MINUTE?
- ( shower running )

15:33.266 --> 15:37.370
- Mel: WHAT?
- OKAY, WELL, I REARRANGED THE OFFICE SCHEDULE

15:37.404 --> 15:40.440
SO WE COULD FIT IN A FEW MORE BATTING
PRACTICES BEFORE SATURDAY'S GAME.

15:40.473 --> 15:42.442
Mel: OKAY.

15:42.475 --> 15:44.377
AND I KNOW YOU WANTED TO PUT
OFF FINDING A NEW INTERN,

15:44.411 --> 15:46.379
BUT WHY WAIT, YOU KNOW?

15:46.413 --> 15:48.381
SO I SCHEDULED 14 CANDIDATES
FOR YOU TO MEET, ALL RIGHT?

15:48.415 --> 15:50.117
WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO CANCEL YOUR
LUNCH, BUT THAT'S HOW IT GOES.

15:50.150 --> 15:52.385
YOU DID WHAT?

15:52.419 --> 15:54.321
CAN WE JUST TALK
ABOUT THIS LATER?

15:54.354 --> 15:56.389
SURE, I'M ACTUALLY GONNA
HEAD INTO THE OFFICE EARLY.

15:56.423 --> 15:58.258
I'VE GOTTA SHOW HANNA HOW TO
MAKE A PROPER CUP OF COFFEE.

15:58.291 --> 16:00.527
I'LL SEE YOU THERE.

16:00.560 --> 16:02.996
- ( door shuts )
- ( shower stops )

16:03.030 --> 16:07.134
( sighs ) ONLY THREE
MORE DAYS OF JOE.

16:07.167 --> 16:09.136
TROPHY, TROPHY, TROPHY, TROPHY!

16:10.570 --> 16:12.039
ALL RIGHT, EVERYBODY,
LET'S ROCK 'N' ROLL.

16:12.072 --> 16:13.140
I GOTTA GET TO WORK.

16:13.173 --> 16:15.175
HUH. "I GOTTA GET TO WORK."

16:15.208 --> 16:17.410
I LOVE SAYING THAT. I
JUST LOVE SAYING THAT.

16:19.212 --> 16:21.214
OH, HEY, I WANTED TO TELL YOU,

16:21.248 --> 16:24.151
I'VE DECIDED TO PUBLISH HOLLY'S
STORY THE WAY SHE WROTE IT.

16:24.184 --> 16:26.153
DON'T MESS WITH ME, LENNOX,

16:26.186 --> 16:28.455
'CAUSE I'M KINDA
FRAGILE RIGHT NOW.

16:28.488 --> 16:30.757
NO, I'M GONNA POST IT AS IS.

16:30.790 --> 16:32.292
WHY WOULD YOU CHANGE YOUR MIND?

16:32.325 --> 16:36.263
WELL, YOU KNOW, I RESPECT
HER ARTISTIC VISION.

16:36.296 --> 16:37.797
IT'S NOT THE WAY I
WOULD'VE DONE IT,

16:37.830 --> 16:40.267
BUT THERE'S A PLACE FOR
WHAT SHE'S WRITTEN.

16:40.300 --> 16:43.503
- YOU FEEL SORRY FOR ME?
- SO MUCH.

16:43.536 --> 16:46.139
WELL, THANK YOU BUT, YOU KNOW,

16:46.173 --> 16:48.208
HOLLY REALLY DOES HAVE A
LOT OF SPECIAL QUALITIES.

16:48.241 --> 16:49.609
KEEP TELLING YOURSELF THAT.

16:50.843 --> 16:53.146
HOW I GET THROUGH THE DAY.

16:54.147 --> 16:55.515
( dog barks )

16:55.548 --> 16:57.817
- ( people chattering )
- ( Mel sighs )

16:57.850 --> 16:59.586
WOW, WE MADE IT.

16:59.619 --> 17:03.056
YEAH, I CAN'T BELIEVE WE GOT
TO THE CHAMPIONSHIP GAME.

17:03.090 --> 17:06.293
ACTUALLY, I WAS THINKING WE MADE
IT THROUGH A WEEK WITH JOE LONGO.

17:06.326 --> 17:09.028
I DON'T KNOW IF I'M EVER GONNA
SEE HIM THE SAME WAY AGAIN.

17:09.862 --> 17:12.165
I WAS WRONG.

17:12.199 --> 17:14.834
- WHEN DID HE GET HERE?
- OH, HE'S BEEN HERE FOR HOURS.

17:14.867 --> 17:17.337
HE WANTED TO SCOUT THE OPPONENTS,
WATCH THEM AT BATTING PRACTICE.

17:17.370 --> 17:20.407
HE EVEN SENT THEM A MUFFIN BASKET SO
THEY'D BE SLEEPY BY THE THIRD INNING.

17:20.440 --> 17:23.110
COUNCILWOMAN BURKE.

17:23.143 --> 17:27.080
- HANCOCK.
- YOU CAN TOUCH IT IF YOU LIKE.

17:27.114 --> 17:31.551
- CLOSE AS YOU'RE GONNA GET.
- WOW. THAT IS GONNA LOOK SO GOOD ON MY DESK.

17:31.584 --> 17:34.387
- MAY THE BEST TEAM WIN.
- OH, THANK YOU, WE WILL.

17:36.189 --> 17:38.391
ALL RIGHT, CHUCK,
HERE'S OUR LINEUP CARD.

17:38.425 --> 17:41.494
I ALREADY GOT YOUR LINEUP CARD
FROM LONGBALL OVER THERE.

17:41.528 --> 17:43.563
WHAT? BUT I DO THE LINEUP CARDS.

17:43.596 --> 17:46.866
- THAN WHAT'S THIS?
- ALL RIGHT, LET'S PLAY SOME BALL.

17:46.899 --> 17:49.502
SCOTTY, THROW SOME DOUGHNUTS ON
THIS BAT, TAKE SOME WARM-UP SWINGS.

17:49.536 --> 17:52.305
HEY, JOE, LISTEN...
JUST A LITTLE THING.

17:52.339 --> 17:55.242
YOU KNOW, THE TEAM CAPTAIN IS THE
ONE WHO DOES THE LINEUP CARDS.

17:55.275 --> 17:57.644
OH, MEL, LET'S NOT GET ALL
CAUGHT UP ON TITLES AND LABELS.

17:57.677 --> 17:59.346
I MEAN, I AM THE OFFICE MANAGER,

17:59.379 --> 18:01.214
BUT WE NEED TO DO WHAT'S
BEST FOR THE TEAM.

18:01.248 --> 18:03.316
OH REALLY? THEN WHY IS
ORENSTEIN HITTING SIXTH?

18:03.350 --> 18:05.218
HE'S A CONTACT HITTER. HE
SHOULD BE BATTING SECOND.

18:05.252 --> 18:08.355
AND THIS ISN'T ABOUT ME, BUT
I ALWAYS LEAD OFF... ALWAYS.

18:08.388 --> 18:10.190
AND THAT'S NOT JUST TO GET
THE GAME-OPENING APPLAUSE

18:10.223 --> 18:11.858
AND THE AIRHORN OVATION.

18:11.891 --> 18:14.861
I PUT YOU THIRD BECAUSE THE BEST
HITTERS ALWAYS HIT THIRD AND FOURTH.

18:14.894 --> 18:17.430
- TRUST ME, THIS IS THE MOST EFFICIENT LINEUP FOR THE TEAM.
- THAT'S RIGHT.

18:17.464 --> 18:19.666
YOU KNOW THE MOST EFFICIENT WAY TO DO
EVERYTHING, JUST LIKE AT THE OFFICE.

18:19.699 --> 18:22.135
I DON'T SEE ANYBODY ELSE AT THE
OFFICE COMPLAINING ABOUT IT.

18:22.169 --> 18:24.671
OH, THAT'S 'CAUSE WE WERE ALL HIDING
IN THE CLOSET HAVING BIRTHDAY CAKE.

18:24.704 --> 18:26.573
YOU WERE...

18:26.606 --> 18:28.641
- WHAT?
- NOTHING. YOU KNOW, AHEM...

18:28.675 --> 18:31.144
NEVER MIND. LET'S JUST... LET'S
JUST FOCUS ON THIS GAME.

18:31.178 --> 18:33.280
WAIT A MINUTE, WAIT A MINUTE.
YOU BLATANTLY IGNORED

18:33.313 --> 18:35.515
MY OFFICE MEMO THAT WE WERE
ACCRUING ALL OFFICE BIRTHDAYS?

18:35.548 --> 18:38.285
THAT'S RIGHT. YEAH,
WE ALL HID FROM YOU.

18:38.318 --> 18:40.287
WE HAD A BIRTHDAY CAKE
IN THE SUPPLY CLOSET,

18:40.320 --> 18:41.654
A GREAT BIG, GIANT
BIRTHDAY CAKE,

18:41.688 --> 18:43.456
AND IT TASTED EVEN BETTER
BECAUSE YOU WEREN'T THERE.

18:43.490 --> 18:45.525
HEY, I AM THE OFFICE
MANAGER HERE, BURKE.

18:45.558 --> 18:47.694
NO NO, YOU'RE THE FAKE
OFFICE MANAGER, OKAY?

18:47.727 --> 18:50.297
YOU'RE LIKE THE BLOW-UP DOLL
YOU PUT IN THE PASSENGER SEAT

18:50.330 --> 18:51.698
SO YOU CAN GET ON
THE CARPOOL LANE.

18:51.731 --> 18:53.600
YOU'RE ONLY HERE TO WIN
THIS BASEBALL GAME FOR US.

18:54.634 --> 18:56.569
LET ME FINISH.

18:56.603 --> 18:59.206
OKAY, I'M DONE.

18:59.239 --> 19:02.175
WELL WELL WELL,
LONGO'S A RINGER.

19:02.209 --> 19:04.711
I AM SHOCKED. SHOCKED.

19:04.744 --> 19:07.714
MR. UMPIRE, I DON'T
KNOW WHAT TO SAY.

19:07.747 --> 19:10.717
I DO. GAME OVER.

19:10.750 --> 19:12.619
MEL'S ANGELS ARE DISQUALIFIED.

19:12.652 --> 19:15.688
WHAT? WAIT. WHAT? YOU CAN'T DO THAT.
THAT'S NOT FAIR.

19:15.722 --> 19:17.524
THE GUY DOESN'T WORK
AT YOUR OFFICE.

19:17.557 --> 19:19.326
BUT... WELL, BUT-BUT-BUT...

19:19.359 --> 19:20.493
I... BUT I REALLY WANTED TO WIN.

19:20.527 --> 19:23.496
I MEAN, I EVEN MADE A SPACE
ON MY DESK FOR THE TROPHY.

19:25.498 --> 19:28.568
I'M SORRY, YOU GUYS. I
DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY.

19:28.601 --> 19:31.471
MEL, LOOK, I DON'T WANT
TO RUIN THIS FOR YOU

19:31.504 --> 19:32.705
AND FOR THE WHOLE TEAM,
SO HOLD ON A MINUTE.

19:32.739 --> 19:34.474
UMP, THERE'S BEEN A BIG
MISTAKE HERE, OKAY?

19:34.507 --> 19:36.309
THIS TEAM DESERVES TO
PLAY IN THIS GAME.

19:36.343 --> 19:38.211
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT. I WILL TAKE
MY UNIFORM OFF FOR YOU RIGHT NOW.

19:38.245 --> 19:41.614
- TOO LATE.
- AT LEAST LET HIM TAKE OFF THE UNIFORM.

19:41.648 --> 19:44.217
WHAT COULD IT HURT?

19:44.251 --> 19:47.220
LISTEN, BURKE, YOU AND I
HAVE HAD OUR DIFFERENCES,

19:47.254 --> 19:50.390
BUT TODAY I THINK I
CAN SAFELY SAY...

19:50.423 --> 19:52.625
LOSER! ( laughs )

19:52.659 --> 19:54.994
OH. OH, TROPHY WANTS
TO TALK TO YOU.

19:55.027 --> 19:58.331
BYE-BYE, MEL. SEE YOU... NEVER.

19:58.365 --> 20:00.367
( chuckles ) GOOD ONE, TROPHY.

20:02.435 --> 20:04.337
WELL, THERE GOES A
REAL CLASS ACT.

20:05.472 --> 20:07.640
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY, MEL.

20:07.674 --> 20:10.310
- BETTER LUCK NEXT YEAR.
- YEAH, I KNOW.

20:10.343 --> 20:12.245
YOU KNOW, I STAYED UP LATE
LAST NIGHT CHOREOGRAPHING

20:12.279 --> 20:14.714
MY LEAGUE CHAMPIONSHIP
VICTORY DANCE.

20:14.747 --> 20:16.516
I'M SURE EVERYBODY STILL
WANTS TO SEE THAT.

20:16.549 --> 20:19.586
- NO. NO.
- ALL RIGHT. NO? OKAY.

20:19.619 --> 20:22.021
WELL, THEN I'LL JUST SEE Y'ALL
BACK AT THE OFFICE ON MONDAY.

20:22.054 --> 20:25.024
- ( all cheer )
- WHOO! CAN WE SEE IT, MEL?

20:25.057 --> 20:28.528
ALL RIGHT. FIVE,
SIX, SEVEN, EIGHT.

20:28.561 --> 20:31.398
- WHOO!

20:31.431 --> 20:32.732
GO, MEL. GO, MEL.

20:32.765 --> 20:36.769

20:36.803 --> 20:38.237
WHOO-HOO!

20:46.613 --> 20:48.581
OH, I FORGOT TO TELL YOU.

20:48.615 --> 20:51.518
LAST NIGHT, ALL THE GUYS AND I
WENT OUT DRINKING AFTER THE GAME

20:51.551 --> 20:54.421
THAT WE ALMOST PLAYED, AND
WYATT GOT A LITTLE CHATTY.

20:54.454 --> 20:58.291
EXACTLY HOW MANY BIRTHDAY PARTIES
DID YOU HAVE IN THAT SUPPLY CLOSET?

20:58.325 --> 20:59.626
- OKAY, THEY WEREN'T PARTIES.
- HOW MANY?

20:59.659 --> 21:01.461
ONE.

21:01.494 --> 21:03.730
SIX, AND THERESA'S BABY SHOWER,

21:03.763 --> 21:05.732
ALTHOUGH THAT WAS NOT EASY.
SHE IS HUGE.

21:07.434 --> 21:08.801
THERE YOU GO, SQUEAKY MOUSE.

21:08.835 --> 21:11.704
( chuckles ) I'M SO
GLAD MY SHIRT IS BACK.

21:11.738 --> 21:13.706
AND?

21:13.740 --> 21:16.643
AND YOU, SCARY BEAR.

21:18.811 --> 21:21.314
- OH, ARE YOU GOING TO ASK HER?
- ABSOLUTELY.

21:21.348 --> 21:25.418
AUNT MEL? HOLLY'S LOOKING
FOR A SUMMER INTERNSHIP

21:25.452 --> 21:28.721
- WITH A COUNCILPERSON, AND SHE WAS WONDERING...
- I GOTTA GO.

21:32.392 --> 21:35.362

21:41.668 --> 21:43.770
( theme music playing )
