00:04.567 --> 00:09.334
Look out, Lex.
There's no way of knowing
how many we're dealing with.

00:51.567 --> 00:53.400
Hey!

00:53.501 --> 00:54.801
Ugh...

00:54.901 --> 00:56.367
agh...

00:56.467 --> 00:59.067
ugh!

01:04.300 --> 01:04.900
Agh!

01:05.000 --> 01:06.601
Agh!

01:16.300 --> 01:17.367
That was close.

01:17.467 --> 01:19.000
Yeah, tell me about it.

01:19.100 --> 01:21.734
Good job, girl.

01:26.634 --> 01:28.701
Oh, that's it.

01:28.801 --> 01:29.901
I'm hitting the shower.

01:30.000 --> 01:32.167
Me first.

01:34.067 --> 01:35.467
What the hell do you
guys think you're doing?

01:35.567 --> 01:37.934
Just having a little, uh...

01:38.033 --> 01:42.300
[laughs] innocent fun.

01:42.400 --> 01:43.767
You guys don't
get out much do you?

01:43.868 --> 01:47.767
Aw, come on, we're just
getting to the good part.

01:47.868 --> 01:49.367
Lex, you don't understand
what I've done here.

01:49.467 --> 01:51.434
I've totally improved
Sanctuary's holosystem by

01:51.534 --> 01:53.634
modifying the game
to match our...

01:53.734 --> 01:56.200
specs.

01:56.300 --> 01:57.467
Well, nice going, Nerd Wonder.

01:57.567 --> 01:59.968
Now delete it.

02:00.067 --> 02:02.434
Do it - or I'll smash
your computer in half.

02:02.534 --> 02:05.634
Shal, you are totally
over-reacting.

02:08.334 --> 02:10.000
I guess it was fun
while it lasted.

02:10.100 --> 02:13.801
Dude, this is
totally your fault.

02:14.667 --> 02:16.767
What a waste.

02:18.734 --> 02:19.801
Everybody happy?

02:19.901 --> 02:21.467
Deleted.

02:21.567 --> 02:22.767
Uh huh.

02:22.868 --> 02:24.067
Well, looks like it's
a little one-on-one.

02:24.167 --> 02:27.167
Yeah, it could've
been two-on-two.

02:37.334 --> 02:41.934
<i>Scientist Adam Kane was a
pioneer of genetic research.</i>

02:42.033 --> 02:45.901
<i>Manipulating DNA to
save human lives.</i>

02:46.000 --> 02:49.601
<i>But in many, their genes
unexpectedly mutated and they</i>

02:49.701 --> 02:54.033
<i>developed superhuman abilities.</i>

even know they exist.</i>

<i>They are...</i>

03:31.601 --> 03:34.033
<i>Mutant X.</i>

03:42.434 --> 03:47.434
[Laughs] Su-whish!

03:48.934 --> 03:50.400
Ooh, two points.

03:50.501 --> 03:51.601
I'll take you to the rack, baby.

03:51.701 --> 03:54.000
Come on.

04:08.601 --> 04:10.067
Hey, Bren?

04:10.167 --> 04:11.367
Yeah, what's up, Shal?

04:11.467 --> 04:14.968
I could've sworn I saw
someone run past my room.

04:15.067 --> 04:17.434
We didn't see anything.

04:18.767 --> 04:21.132
Hey, Jess, did you take a
look at the climate control?

04:21.233 --> 04:22.234
Yeah, in a sec.

04:22.334 --> 04:23.400
We're in the middle of the game.

04:23.501 --> 04:25.367
It's eighty degrees and rising.

04:25.467 --> 04:26.701
Did you try and override it?

04:26.801 --> 04:30.567
No, I thought I'd come down
here and whine about it first.

04:30.667 --> 04:32.734
Practice.

04:41.501 --> 04:43.300
It's not responding.

04:43.400 --> 04:44.901
Wonder why?

04:45.000 --> 04:46.167
This is not my fault.

04:46.267 --> 04:47.234
Don't blame me.

04:47.334 --> 04:48.200
There's no way that
the game could've

04:48.300 --> 04:49.434
compromised the
system, all right?

04:49.534 --> 04:51.167
Well, maybe it drew
down too much power.

04:51.267 --> 04:52.234
Overloaded the computer.

04:52.334 --> 04:53.234
It's a game.

04:53.334 --> 04:54.467
Besides, what
difference does it make?

04:54.567 --> 04:55.901
I wiped it from the
drive, you remember?

04:56.000 --> 04:58.067
Okay, someone's in
here. I saw him again.

04:58.167 --> 04:58.934
What?

04:59.033 --> 04:59.968
She's seeing things.

05:00.067 --> 05:01.267
I am not.

05:01.367 --> 05:02.300
Shal, we're alone.

05:02.400 --> 05:05.534
Come here. Look.

05:05.634 --> 05:06.434
There we go.

05:06.534 --> 05:07.567
Four heat points.

05:07.667 --> 05:10.601
One, two, three,
four of us, right?

05:10.701 --> 05:11.834
I don't care what
your computer says.

05:11.934 --> 05:12.734
I saw him.

05:12.834 --> 05:14.100
I felt him.

05:14.200 --> 05:15.901
Jess, what are doing
about this heat, man?

05:16.000 --> 05:17.300
Dude, I am trying.

05:17.400 --> 05:18.567
There's a glitch in the system.

05:18.667 --> 05:22.133
I think we should
do a security sweep.

05:24.267 --> 05:28.467
Hey... look, Jess.
What is this?

05:28.567 --> 05:29.801
What the hell...?

05:29.901 --> 05:33.234
<i>So, soldier, you think you
have what it takes to become</i>

05:33.334 --> 05:34.501
<i>a member of our
Tunnel Quest team?</i>

05:34.601 --> 05:35.834
I thought you
deleted that program.

05:35.934 --> 05:40.067
Yeah, I did.

05:40.167 --> 05:41.934
All right, now, what are
you doing about this heat?

05:42.033 --> 05:44.901
Uh, I guess I'll try to
access the thermostat through

05:45.000 --> 05:47.300
Sanctuary's brain.

05:47.400 --> 05:49.968
Hmm.

05:58.400 --> 05:59.434
Jesse's right.

05:59.534 --> 06:02.000
The place is clear.

06:02.100 --> 06:03.868
I'm not imagining things.

06:03.968 --> 06:06.367
I saw something.

06:06.467 --> 06:08.667
But for some reason I'm not
picking up a scent anywhere.

06:08.767 --> 06:09.934
It's so strange.

06:10.033 --> 06:14.734
Well what exactly did you see?

06:14.834 --> 06:15.567
It's hard to explain.

06:15.667 --> 06:17.767
It was big, but it was a blur.

06:17.868 --> 06:18.968
Was it a man, or a woman?

06:19.067 --> 06:21.334
I don't know.

06:21.434 --> 06:23.000
Like a ghost or something.

06:32.100 --> 06:34.767
Out of the way.

06:37.300 --> 06:38.133
What the hell happened?

06:38.234 --> 06:40.868
The circuitry's overheated.

06:40.968 --> 06:44.467
I mean, is it just me or is
this place freaking out?

06:56.033 --> 06:56.934
All right, Jess, come on.

06:57.033 --> 06:58.100
Let me in there.

06:58.200 --> 06:59.901
Oh, I've almost got it.

07:00.000 --> 07:02.534
You can't just blast this with
one of your charges, Brennan.

07:02.634 --> 07:04.067
It's delicate stuff.

07:04.167 --> 07:06.367
Yeah, I see that.

07:06.467 --> 07:10.934
Meanwhile I'm frying over here.

07:14.801 --> 07:17.434
Jess, why's the security
system activated?

07:17.534 --> 07:18.634
It's not.

07:18.734 --> 07:21.133
Well, you might want to
come take a look at this.

07:28.767 --> 07:31.701
Oh, this can't be happening.

07:31.801 --> 07:33.801
These two dots are
Lexa and Shalimar.

07:33.901 --> 07:36.167
The security system's
interpreting them as intruders.

07:36.267 --> 07:40.667
Well, shut it down before
the system attacks.

07:40.767 --> 07:43.601
Yeah - it's not working.

07:43.701 --> 07:44.834
We need to get
them out of there.

07:44.934 --> 07:45.968
Shal, Lex...

07:46.067 --> 07:47.167
Look, we got a big problem here.

07:47.267 --> 07:48.868
<i>You need to get down
to the Helix now.</i>

07:48.968 --> 07:50.133
What's going on?

07:50.234 --> 07:53.000
<i>Security system has detected
you both as hostiles.</i>

07:53.100 --> 07:54.667
<i>So get out of here.</i>

07:54.767 --> 07:57.133
Hurry.

08:05.100 --> 08:06.434
What's happening here, Jess?

08:06.534 --> 08:07.934
Sanctuary's
going into a lockdown,

08:08.033 --> 08:08.968
and I can't control it.

08:09.067 --> 08:11.267
Get out of here - now.

08:21.334 --> 08:24.067
Come on, let's go!

08:24.167 --> 08:25.200
What about the guys?

08:25.300 --> 08:26.734
Shalimar, there's no time!

08:26.834 --> 08:29.634
Get out of here now!

08:31.934 --> 08:33.400
The hangar door's closing.

08:33.501 --> 08:34.734
We can beat it.

08:34.833 --> 08:36.433
We'll be sheared in half.

08:36.534 --> 08:38.801
Let's hope you're wrong.

08:52.567 --> 08:54.667
Why do I get the feeling
there's nothing you can do
about all this?

08:54.767 --> 08:59.000
Right now I'm not in control
of anything, Brennan.

08:59.901 --> 09:02.701
Well, who is?

09:05.033 --> 09:09.100
<i>Wouldn't you like to
know, Mr. Mulwray?</i>

09:14.534 --> 09:18.934
<i>In my game, I
decide who lives...</i>

09:19.033 --> 09:23.100
<i>... and who dies.</i>

09:28.934 --> 09:30.634
That was cutting
things pretty close.

09:30.734 --> 09:34.300
Oh, we had at least two more
seconds to clear the doors.

09:34.400 --> 09:37.734
You got ice-water running
through your veins.

09:37.834 --> 09:40.567
So what are we going to do
about Brennan and Jesse?

09:40.667 --> 09:42.667
Afraid that was
a one-way ticket.

09:42.767 --> 09:48.100
I've isolated the Helix's
computer link to Sanctuary.

09:48.200 --> 09:49.834
Look, we can't afford to let it
infect the system or we could

09:49.934 --> 09:52.868
drop from the sky.

09:56.267 --> 09:58.033
I wonder if our
comlinks are active.

09:58.133 --> 09:59.567
I don't know. Keep your
fingers crossed.

09:59.667 --> 10:01.534
Brennan?

10:01.634 --> 10:02.567
Brennan, can you read me?

10:02.667 --> 10:03.834
Yeah.

10:03.934 --> 10:05.234
Yeah, we're here. We're
locked up in the hangar.

10:05.334 --> 10:07.367
Jesse's trying to figure
out what's going on.

10:07.467 --> 10:10.334
I'll tell you what's going on -
that game of yours
infected the system.

10:10.434 --> 10:12.334
Had to, but I don't see how.

10:12.434 --> 10:14.334
<i>Look, Sanctuary's got firewalls
to protect it from even the</i>

10:14.434 --> 10:18.334
<i>most high-tech viruses.</i>

10:24.033 --> 10:26.434
Guys, are you there?

10:26.534 --> 10:28.934
Shal!

10:29.033 --> 10:29.567
Hey, guys.

10:29.667 --> 10:30.300
Lexa?

10:30.400 --> 10:31.901
You guys there?

10:32.000 --> 10:34.801
Brennan, can you hear me?

10:34.901 --> 10:36.133
It's no use.

10:36.234 --> 10:39.267
The virus must've
infected communications.

10:39.367 --> 10:43.334
Brennan!

10:43.434 --> 10:44.467
Brennan?

10:44.567 --> 10:47.801
<i>Shalimar, I'm here.</i>

10:47.901 --> 10:49.367
<i>But I don't know
for how much longer.</i>

10:49.467 --> 10:50.734
What's our next move?

10:50.834 --> 10:52.367
<i>Jesse thinks there's a way
to override the system.</i>

10:52.467 --> 10:54.267
<i>But you're going to have
to do it from the ground.</i>

10:54.367 --> 10:55.734
How?

10:55.834 --> 10:57.434
<i>Well, Adam installed a backdoor
system in an offsite facility</i>

10:57.534 --> 10:59.300
<i>in case of emergency.</i>

10:59.400 --> 11:00.934
That's news to me.

11:01.033 --> 11:03.234
<i>Well, lucky for us there's
some things you don't know.</i>

11:03.334 --> 11:07.601
<i>Adam took every precaution
against Sanctuary being
compromised.</i>

11:07.701 --> 11:09.067
So where's this facility?

11:09.167 --> 11:11.033
<i>There's a warehouse at
51 Shepherd.</i>

11:11.133 --> 11:12.367
<i>Call me from there.</i>

11:12.467 --> 11:14.767
<i>Jesse will talk you
through the backup system.</i>

11:14.868 --> 11:17.801
You got it.

11:28.634 --> 11:33.734
[Sound of phone dialing]

11:33.834 --> 11:34.467
<i>Operator: 911.</i>

11:34.567 --> 11:35.901
<i>Yes, thank God.</i>

11:36.000 --> 11:38.601
<i>The two terrorists responsible
for the explosion at Syntech</i>

11:38.701 --> 11:40.434
are on their way to 51 Shepherd.

11:40.534 --> 11:42.200
<i>But you've got to
get there right away.</i>

11:42.300 --> 11:43.968
<i>They're armed and dangerous.</i>

11:44.067 --> 11:47.334
<i>Operator: Identify
yourself, please sir...</i>

11:47.434 --> 11:51.834
You're not playing that
stupid game again, are you?

11:51.934 --> 11:55.667
Do you know what obsessive-
compulsive means, Willie?

11:55.767 --> 11:57.801
Huh?

11:57.901 --> 11:59.033
Mmm...

11:59.133 --> 12:03.601
Yummy - liver,
onions, sweet potato.

12:09.434 --> 12:12.534
Is there something
wrong, Willie?

12:12.634 --> 12:16.200
You didn't even say
anything about my hairdo.

12:16.300 --> 12:18.567
If you don't start paying
better attention, I'm going to

12:18.667 --> 12:22.701
have to erase that
game from you computer.

12:22.801 --> 12:24.167
<i>Sorry, Nurse Helen.</i>

12:24.267 --> 12:25.400
Uh...

12:25.501 --> 12:27.200
<i>I think it makes you
look ten years younger.</i>

12:27.300 --> 12:34.701
What the hell...?

12:34.801 --> 12:40.934
Look what you
made me do.

12:41.033 --> 12:45.601
Look at me.

12:45.701 --> 12:47.167
All right.

12:47.267 --> 12:48.167
That's it.

12:48.267 --> 12:49.934
No more games.

12:50.033 --> 12:52.901
<i>Nurse Gamble, please report
to the Nurse's Station.</i>

12:53.000 --> 12:58.767
<i>Nurse Gamble, please report
to the Nurse's Station.</i>

13:01.868 --> 13:04.834
I'll deal with you later.

13:07.901 --> 13:10.133
<i>And I'll deal with you later.</i>

13:11.667 --> 13:17.767
<i>Well, well, things are finally
starting to heat up, boys.</i>

13:20.033 --> 13:23.601
Can you reach them
on any channels?

13:23.701 --> 13:24.534
No.

13:24.634 --> 13:27.100
We're completely cut off.

13:27.200 --> 13:29.767
Is there any chance you can
phase out of this place?

13:29.868 --> 13:34.868
Not as long as the
disrupter field is active.

13:34.968 --> 13:36.300
Ah.

13:36.400 --> 13:41.467
An the bright side, I think I've
figured out this heat thing.

13:41.567 --> 13:45.667
Ready?

13:46.534 --> 13:48.467
Hah!

13:48.567 --> 13:50.200
Whoo!

13:50.300 --> 13:53.067
Yeah!

13:53.167 --> 13:56.234
Hah.

13:56.334 --> 13:57.667
Ah, amen, brother.

13:57.767 --> 14:00.067
[Laughs] All right, I take
back anything bad I've ever

14:00.167 --> 14:01.501
said about you.

14:01.601 --> 14:02.467
Ah...

14:02.567 --> 14:04.868
I'm gonna remember that.

14:04.968 --> 14:06.801
[Laughs] Nice installation.

14:06.901 --> 14:08.968
Some top-notch security systems.

14:09.067 --> 14:10.200
I thought you deleted this game.

14:10.300 --> 14:12.567
Yeah, I did - several times.

14:12.667 --> 14:15.634
Well, he's not
acting very deleted.

14:15.734 --> 14:19.567
Well, since he's a
hologram, uh, his weapons
can't hurt us, right?

14:19.667 --> 14:23.367
Not as far as I know.

14:33.868 --> 14:39.300
[Groaning] Jess, do something!

14:42.100 --> 14:43.467
Who are you?

14:43.567 --> 14:48.634
Sergeant Nalle,
Tunnel Squad Unit Leader.

14:52.834 --> 14:55.934
Think you could withstand
an increase in the voltage?

14:58.667 --> 15:00.100
What do you want?

15:00.200 --> 15:02.133
At the moment, I want to know
how much juice it's going to

15:02.234 --> 15:03.834
take to kill you.

15:03.934 --> 15:06.033
<i>Even for someone like you...</i>

15:06.133 --> 15:09.968
<i>a man's gotta have
a breaking point.</i>

15:10.067 --> 15:17.400
[Groaning] Agh!

15:23.067 --> 15:24.901
Brennan!

15:25.000 --> 15:27.901
You all right?

15:36.267 --> 15:37.400
All right.

15:37.501 --> 15:38.901
Warehouse is right below us.

15:39.000 --> 15:43.033
Let's take her down.

15:43.133 --> 15:47.067
Seems like a strange place
for Adam to build a backdoor
to Sanctuary.

15:47.167 --> 15:49.634
Well, you know with Adam -
nothing was ever the

15:49.734 --> 15:52.033
way it seemed, right?

15:53.367 --> 15:54.267
Hey, Bren, we're good to go.

15:54.367 --> 15:55.701
<i>Good deal.</i>

15:55.801 --> 15:57.300
<i>Make your way down and I'll
have Jess talk you through an</i>

15:57.400 --> 15:59.667
<i>internal override.</i>

15:59.767 --> 16:04.467
All right.

16:04.567 --> 16:07.567
Whoever's doing this
knows who we are.

16:07.667 --> 16:08.968
Already knows
everything about us.

16:09.067 --> 16:10.234
Yeah.

16:10.334 --> 16:11.968
Come on.

16:12.067 --> 16:14.400
Uh...

16:14.501 --> 16:17.934
uh...

16:21.968 --> 16:27.734
Hey, Willie - wakey, wakey.

16:27.834 --> 16:30.567
My shift's over, so
I just dropped by,

16:30.667 --> 16:34.767
to kiss you good night.

16:34.868 --> 16:38.534
I thought that might
get a rise out of you.

16:39.367 --> 16:43.801
Hmm, he loves me...

16:43.901 --> 16:48.167
...he loves me not.

16:48.267 --> 16:50.234
You see, Willie.

16:50.334 --> 16:56.601
I have complete
control over your life.

16:56.701 --> 17:03.100
If you were to die,
no one would ever miss you.

17:03.200 --> 17:09.233
[Heart monitor speeds up]

17:09.334 --> 17:10.166
No.

17:10.267 --> 17:11.567
No, hold on.

17:11.666 --> 17:12.300
Hold on!

17:12.400 --> 17:13.634
Don't you do that!

17:13.733 --> 17:15.634
[Heart monitor stops]

17:15.733 --> 17:18.534
Damn it!

17:18.634 --> 17:25.099
[Screams]

17:25.200 --> 17:30.501
[Heart monitors start up]

17:36.934 --> 17:38.567
I don't get it.

17:38.667 --> 17:40.767
What's this about?

17:40.868 --> 17:42.334
Revenge...

17:42.434 --> 17:43.701
power trip...

17:43.801 --> 17:44.868
Insanity.

17:44.968 --> 17:47.467
Maybe all of the above.

17:49.267 --> 17:50.834
What do we do?

17:50.934 --> 17:54.467
That's just it - there's
nothing we can do.

17:54.567 --> 17:57.701
We're sitting ducks and
he's calling all the shots.

17:57.801 --> 17:59.400
No, there's gotta be a way
we can turn this around.

17:59.501 --> 18:00.968
We can't just give up.

18:01.067 --> 18:03.467
Brennan, if he's controlling
the computers...

18:03.567 --> 18:06.367
and he's got access to the
security cameras... all the

18:06.467 --> 18:11.033
sensors and detectors...
we can't even blink
without him seeing.

18:11.133 --> 18:14.801
All right. Then we shut down
the entire system.

18:14.901 --> 18:16.868
Uh...

18:16.968 --> 18:18.267
come on.

18:18.367 --> 18:20.934
We do that, we're not just
going to lose the power in

18:21.033 --> 18:23.501
here, but in all of Sanctuary.

18:23.601 --> 18:26.868
The ventilators, all
of the computers.

18:26.968 --> 18:30.067
Nobody will be able to
get in or out of here.

18:30.167 --> 18:31.767
Oh, man.

18:31.868 --> 18:34.167
All right.
Come on, Jess.

18:34.267 --> 18:37.934
There's got to be a way we can
get him out of our computer.

18:38.067 --> 18:42.501
How did he get in?

18:42.601 --> 18:47.601
He's got to be bouncing a signal
off of Sanctuary's satellite.

18:47.701 --> 18:53.834
Cut off his uplink,
he'll lose his access.

18:53.934 --> 18:55.067
Fine.

18:55.167 --> 18:56.968
Let's do it.

18:57.067 --> 19:03.868
Our only problem is figuring out
how to do it without him seeing.

19:05.667 --> 19:07.701
<i>You know I'm watching.</i>

19:07.801 --> 19:09.567
<i>That's very good.</i>

19:09.667 --> 19:12.801
<i>Now what are you
going to do about it?</i>

19:31.133 --> 19:32.133
Okay, Brennan, we're in.

19:32.234 --> 19:35.234
What's next?

19:35.334 --> 19:36.567
Brennan?

19:36.667 --> 19:38.300
Jesse?

19:40.167 --> 19:42.200
Something's wrong.

19:42.300 --> 19:47.434
Yeah. I don't see any
equipment anywhere.

19:48.901 --> 19:52.100
That's not him.

19:52.200 --> 19:53.400
We've got company.

19:53.501 --> 19:55.000
Move it! Let's go! Let's go.
Let's go! Let's go!

19:55.100 --> 19:57.567
Okay, there
they are. Ready? Right there.

19:57.667 --> 19:58.834
Okay, hit the floor.

19:58.934 --> 20:00.167
Nobody move!

20:00.267 --> 20:01.000
Cover the door!

20:01.100 --> 20:04.033
Frank, get the door!

20:07.067 --> 20:09.801
Looking for someone?

20:13.801 --> 20:16.067
Over there! Go, go, go!

20:16.167 --> 20:16.901
Let's get out of here.

20:17.000 --> 20:19.801
Go, go! Move, move!

20:19.901 --> 20:21.534
Time to get the
hell out of Dodge.

20:21.634 --> 20:23.434
Mind explaining what just
happened back there?

20:23.534 --> 20:25.300
Why the hell would
Brennan set us up?

20:25.400 --> 20:27.033
He didn't.

20:55.868 --> 21:00.801
Got 'em.

21:00.901 --> 21:05.868
You gotta take
out all three cameras before
he's got time to retaliate.

21:05.968 --> 21:08.767
It's important - we only got
one shot at this, Brennan.

21:08.868 --> 21:11.267
Well, one shot's all I need.

21:11.367 --> 21:13.868
Let's do it.

21:20.200 --> 21:21.234
Ohh, whoo!

21:21.334 --> 21:23.734
Ha ha!

21:23.834 --> 21:25.367
Done-ski.

21:25.467 --> 21:27.100
Not bad.

21:27.200 --> 21:29.767
<i>But unfortunately,</i>

21:29.868 --> 21:32.100
<i>I still have the
infrared sensors.</i>

21:32.200 --> 21:37.267
<i>I may not be able to see
those baby blues, but this
will do just fine.</i>

21:37.367 --> 21:39.400
Now what do we do?

21:39.501 --> 21:42.634
Now we got to get to
the uplink access panel.

21:42.734 --> 21:44.501
And that would be?

21:44.601 --> 21:45.767
Top of the ventilator shaft.

21:45.868 --> 21:47.601
Through the air duct.

21:47.701 --> 21:48.634
All right. I'm ready.

21:48.734 --> 21:49.934
Whoa - wait.
Wait, wait, wait!

21:50.033 --> 21:51.701
It's not going to work.

21:51.801 --> 21:52.767
Why not?

21:52.868 --> 21:54.701
He can still see us.

21:54.801 --> 21:55.567
What are you talking about?

21:55.667 --> 21:56.367
We just blinded him.

21:56.467 --> 21:58.267
The body heat sensors.

21:58.367 --> 22:00.000
Oh, come on, man.
You're killing me here.

22:00.100 --> 22:01.901
Hey, Adam designed
this place, all right?

22:02.000 --> 22:03.901
And he designed it
to be impregnable.

22:04.000 --> 22:05.467
Oh, great.

22:05.567 --> 22:07.434
Well, too bad Adam wasn't here
so he could see how his genius

22:07.534 --> 22:10.968
is biting us all in
the ass right now.

22:11.067 --> 22:13.334
What would happen
if I was to raise the

22:13.434 --> 22:18.234
temperature in here to
a toasty 98.6 degrees?

22:18.334 --> 22:20.100
Ha.

22:20.200 --> 22:21.334
Well, we'd be invisible.

22:21.434 --> 22:24.534
Invisible.

22:30.701 --> 22:32.501
Here's a playback of our
conversation with Brennan.

22:32.601 --> 22:34.334
Listen to this.

22:34.434 --> 22:35.701
<i>Shalimar, I'm here.</i>

22:35.801 --> 22:38.334
<i>But I don't know
for how much longer.</i>

22:38.434 --> 22:39.634
Hear the click?

22:39.734 --> 22:41.167
Right before he starts to speak?

22:41.267 --> 22:42.100
<i>Shalimar, I'm here.</i>

22:42.200 --> 22:42.968
Yeah.

22:43.067 --> 22:45.467
Our call was intercepted.

22:45.567 --> 22:47.167
Someone sampled Brennan's voice.

22:47.267 --> 22:48.901
Sent us into that trap.

22:49.000 --> 22:49.801
Yeah.

22:49.901 --> 22:51.667
On our comlink frequency.

22:51.767 --> 22:57.200
Man, whoever's doing this has
got to be pretty powerful.

22:57.300 --> 23:00.601
Powerful enough to give
us instant rap sheets.

23:00.701 --> 23:03.901
Made us look like
Public Enemy number one.

23:04.000 --> 23:06.400
Well, maybe it's time we called
"Brennan" back

23:06.501 --> 23:08.067
- thank him personally.

23:08.167 --> 23:12.767
See who we're playing with?

23:12.868 --> 23:15.234
Hey, Bren?

23:15.334 --> 23:16.901
It's Shal.

23:17.000 --> 23:18.968
<i>How's the heat in there?</i>

23:19.067 --> 23:20.100
<i>Totally under control.</i>

23:20.200 --> 23:23.334
<i>How are you guys holding up?</i>

23:23.434 --> 23:25.767
Well, we
tried to get into that warehouse
but the cops were after us.

23:25.868 --> 23:28.601
How weird is that?

23:28.701 --> 23:31.667
Very weird.

23:31.767 --> 23:35.968
So has
Jesse finally managed to beat
you at your little game yet?

23:36.067 --> 23:38.400
<i>I say when the game is over.</i>

23:39.667 --> 23:41.868
I say when the game's over!

23:47.167 --> 23:50.701
So are you guys any closer
to finding out who's behind
all this?

23:50.801 --> 23:52.734
<i>I wish.</i>

23:52.834 --> 23:55.868
Must be somebody
pretty brilliant, huh?

23:55.968 --> 24:00.467
What do you think?

24:02.100 --> 24:03.734
Still there?

24:03.834 --> 24:07.701
<i>I think you know more
than you're saying.</i>

24:07.801 --> 24:09.701
Just worried about you, Bren.

24:09.801 --> 24:11.834
<i><u> Intruder's real voice:
Too late for that.</u></i>

24:15.167 --> 24:17.400
I know this guy.

24:17.501 --> 24:18.834
William Dennett.

24:18.934 --> 24:21.067
Doesn't ring a bell to me.

24:21.167 --> 24:22.968
He's a cybernetic mutant.

24:23.067 --> 24:27.033
He can connect with
computers through his brain.

24:27.133 --> 24:30.367
He's a human computer virus.

24:32.534 --> 24:35.100
He was selling military secrets.

24:35.200 --> 24:37.300
We tracked him down to an
apartment building on the river

24:37.400 --> 24:41.367
and chased him up onto the roof.

24:51.667 --> 24:52.667
Dennett!

24:52.767 --> 24:54.467
You're not going anywhere.
It's over.

24:54.567 --> 24:57.634
I say when the game's over.

25:04.033 --> 25:06.801
Last we heard he was
paralyzed for life.

25:06.901 --> 25:11.767
How could he be doing this?

25:11.868 --> 25:14.567
Maybe he's got nine lives.

25:14.667 --> 25:16.567
The point is this psycho's been
playing us from the start,

25:16.667 --> 25:18.133
separating the team on purpose.

25:18.234 --> 25:19.067
Yeah.

25:19.167 --> 25:20.968
So he could target
us one by one.

25:21.067 --> 25:24.667
The problem is I can't
find any record of a
William Dennett anywhere.

25:24.767 --> 25:27.434
Well, a guy this smart would've
wiped the slate clean.

25:27.534 --> 25:28.868
Well, that's great.

25:28.968 --> 25:31.400
Then how exactly are we supposed
to find him and shut him down?

25:31.501 --> 25:32.934
You know what?

25:33.033 --> 25:34.901
No one vanishes without a trace.

25:35.000 --> 25:38.734
We're just going to have to do
this the old-fashioned way.

25:41.067 --> 25:43.334
98.6 and holding.

25:43.434 --> 25:44.367
Sweet.

25:44.467 --> 25:46.534
Well, at least it's a dry heat.

25:46.634 --> 25:51.501
Well, then we're good to go.

25:54.033 --> 25:55.767
<i>You're catching on.</i>

25:55.868 --> 25:57.634
<i>That was very clever.</i>

25:57.734 --> 26:01.634
<i>But I still have
a few moves left.</i>

26:25.934 --> 26:29.434
All right. I'm in.
Where am I headed?

26:29.534 --> 26:31.901
You should see a grating
at the end of the duct.

26:32.000 --> 26:40.133
It'll be less than ten
feet in front of you.

26:40.234 --> 26:41.834
All right. I'm here.
Now what?

26:41.934 --> 26:46.734
Pry it off.
Let me know what you see.

26:52.000 --> 26:55.334
[Laughs] Oh, man.

26:55.434 --> 26:59.901
You're not going to believe
this: Crystal blue sky.

27:00.000 --> 27:01.634
No, you're right.
I don't believe it.

27:01.734 --> 27:04.267
That's got to be another
hologram from the
Tunnel Quest game.

27:04.367 --> 27:07.767
No, in the game, the soldier
is waiting at the other end.

27:07.868 --> 27:10.501
He puts up his hand.
That's how you know you
made it to the next level.

27:10.601 --> 27:14.033
Yeah, but this guy doesn't
play by the rules, Brennan.

27:14.133 --> 27:15.467
I'm gonna take a closer look.

27:15.567 --> 27:17.300
Bren, just hold up.

27:17.400 --> 27:18.868
Jess, you said it yourself.

27:18.968 --> 27:21.567
This is the only
way to the uplink.

27:21.667 --> 27:23.067
No, no - I get a
bad feeling here.

27:23.167 --> 27:26.834
I think it's another
one of his traps.

27:31.267 --> 27:33.634
Brennan?

27:38.067 --> 27:39.400
Brennan!

27:40.100 --> 27:41.400
Brennan!

27:41.501 --> 27:42.901
Brennan, you all right?

27:43.000 --> 27:44.400
[Coughs]

27:44.501 --> 27:45.667
Brennan?

27:45.767 --> 27:46.801
Yeah.

27:46.901 --> 27:50.634
[Coughs] But I'm going
to need a new watch.

27:53.400 --> 27:55.868
He knew you were there.

28:00.467 --> 28:04.267
He's still watching.

28:04.367 --> 28:06.067
How the hell is it possible?

28:13.434 --> 28:15.734
<i>Checkmate.</i>

28:22.267 --> 28:24.501
Stupid me!

28:24.601 --> 28:27.701
I should've realized you
could phase like that.

28:27.801 --> 28:31.567
Wait... I did think of that.

28:31.667 --> 28:34.100
You're that cybernetic.

28:34.200 --> 28:38.767
How did you survive that fall?

28:38.868 --> 28:41.200
Oh, enough about me.

28:41.300 --> 28:44.834
This is about you.

28:47.400 --> 28:51.901
Let's see how long
you can stay phased.

28:53.767 --> 28:55.467
Agh...!

29:00.367 --> 29:01.634
Too bad.

29:01.734 --> 29:06.767
You've already lost the game.

29:06.868 --> 29:09.334
You should've left me alone.

29:11.067 --> 29:14.434
Why don't you pick on
someone your own size?

29:14.534 --> 29:16.901
Haven't we been
through this before?

29:17.000 --> 29:20.167
Yeah, and it ends the same way.

29:24.968 --> 29:26.434
No!

29:26.534 --> 29:29.100
This time it ends my way.

29:32.167 --> 29:33.968
He winged you, huh?

29:34.067 --> 29:35.634
I can feel it.

29:35.734 --> 29:37.701
Aw, it's just scratch.

29:37.801 --> 29:41.434
Well, I don't know about you,
but I'm pretty tired of
playing this game.

29:55.601 --> 29:56.601
Hi.

29:56.701 --> 29:58.100
Can I help you?

29:58.200 --> 29:58.901
Yeah.

29:59.000 --> 30:02.434
I... I hope you can help me.

30:02.534 --> 30:07.033
Is this where they keep
the hard copies for the
patients' records?

30:07.133 --> 30:08.100
Yeah.

30:08.200 --> 30:11.400
You see, um - Barry
- it's my uncle.

30:11.501 --> 30:14.234
He used to be here, but I'm
afraid he's been transferred to

30:14.334 --> 30:16.267
another hospital.

30:16.367 --> 30:20.901
I'm afraid he's been
moved somewhere, so...

30:21.000 --> 30:23.200
Um, these files are...

30:23.300 --> 30:24.634
sealed.

30:24.734 --> 30:28.901
You have to have the proper
authorization and all those...

30:29.000 --> 30:30.100
I'll call a doctor.

30:30.200 --> 30:31.501
No, Barry, no.

30:31.601 --> 30:33.200
I... I just...

30:33.300 --> 30:35.968
I don't know what happened.
I got this sharp pain.

30:36.067 --> 30:38.100
You don't think it's
my appendix, do you?

30:38.200 --> 30:40.901
I'm not a doctor.

30:41.000 --> 30:43.133
[Breathing heavily]
Well, uh...

30:43.234 --> 30:44.400
um, could you do me a favour,
and tell me do me a favour and

30:44.501 --> 30:46.467
tell if you think it
feels swollen to you?

30:46.567 --> 30:48.634
You know,
you... you don't understand.

30:48.734 --> 30:50.868
I... I don't know
what I'm doing... here.

30:50.968 --> 30:51.834
Ah, whoo.

30:51.934 --> 30:53.767
Oh, a little lower, Bare.

30:53.868 --> 30:56.734
Whoa... not that low.

30:56.834 --> 30:57.734
Yeah.

30:57.834 --> 30:59.968
Oh... whew.

31:00.067 --> 31:01.601
Well, uh, you know, you're
not going to believe this.

31:01.701 --> 31:05.133
I suddenly feel a
whole lot better.

31:05.234 --> 31:07.334
Shal.
Ready to go?

31:07.434 --> 31:09.100
Yeah.

31:09.200 --> 31:12.834
Well, you really have
the magic touch, Barry.

31:21.868 --> 31:25.100
So, do you recognize him?

31:25.200 --> 31:27.767
William Dennett.

31:27.868 --> 31:29.601
But I can't imagine after the
fall that he took that he'd

31:29.701 --> 31:30.701
still look that good.

31:30.801 --> 31:32.534
Dude, he's a hologram.

31:32.634 --> 31:36.567
Could have made himself look
like Brad Pitt if he'd wanted.

31:36.667 --> 31:38.267
Yeah.

31:38.367 --> 31:40.400
Now we got to get him
out of our system.

31:40.501 --> 31:45.234
Well,
if you can't get to the uplink,
we've got no more options.

31:45.334 --> 31:46.167
Oh, no, no, no.

31:46.267 --> 31:47.234
Come on, we can't let him win.

31:47.334 --> 31:48.701
We got to figure out
a way to stop him.

31:48.801 --> 31:56.133
Well, if you think of anything,
let me know, all right?

32:01.100 --> 32:02.901
This guy's unbelievable.

32:03.000 --> 32:05.968
He got himself transferred
to a private facility.

32:06.067 --> 32:08.501
Private hospitals
cost a lot of money.

32:08.601 --> 32:11.067
Where'd Bennett come up
with that kind of cash?

32:11.167 --> 32:14.767
Someone with his power could tap
into banks like we check e-mail.

32:14.868 --> 32:18.100
Now, according to this he's a
resident of Woodbridge Gardens.

32:18.200 --> 32:21.801
Nothing but the best for him.

32:21.901 --> 32:23.834
He must have hijacked
Sanctuary's computer uplink

32:23.934 --> 32:27.434
when Jesse downloaded the game.

32:27.534 --> 32:29.167
So if he's still controlling
Sanctuary, that means he's

32:29.267 --> 32:30.400
still connected.

32:30.501 --> 32:31.400
We don't have a lot of time.

32:31.501 --> 32:33.834
Let's hope he's still there.

32:43.801 --> 32:44.968
Forget it.

32:45.067 --> 32:48.133
It's not going to work.

32:51.901 --> 32:53.701
Oh, man.

32:53.801 --> 32:55.467
All right, so what
do we do, huh?

32:55.567 --> 32:56.868
What? We just give up?

32:56.968 --> 33:01.267
Well, enough people tell you
you're a drunk, you'll lay down.

33:04.033 --> 33:06.400
You guys disappoint me.

33:06.501 --> 33:10.167
I really expected you to
put up much more of a fight.

33:10.267 --> 33:11.601
I'm not giving up.

33:11.701 --> 33:12.868
Too late.

33:12.968 --> 33:14.767
You failed.

33:14.868 --> 33:16.767
Game over, boys.

33:16.868 --> 33:19.267
Sweet dreams.

33:20.734 --> 33:23.567
Brennan...

33:23.667 --> 33:26.834
[coughing]

33:31.334 --> 33:33.501
How is killing us
going to change anything?

33:33.601 --> 33:36.734
Because of you, I don't
look like this anymore.

33:36.834 --> 33:39.501
I'm withered, paralyzed...

33:39.601 --> 33:41.200
It wasn't our fault.

33:41.300 --> 33:43.701
We were only trying
to stop you, Dennett.

33:43.801 --> 33:45.100
I can understand your anger.

33:45.200 --> 33:47.434
You can't begin to understand!

33:47.534 --> 33:49.501
Okay, so tell us about it.

33:49.601 --> 33:50.968
Look, you're smart, William.

33:51.067 --> 33:53.334
You broke into an impenetrable
system and managed to

33:53.434 --> 33:55.300
manipulate it.

33:55.400 --> 33:57.968
I found the traps that
were already there.

33:58.067 --> 34:00.133
The possibilities for a man
like you are limitless.

34:00.234 --> 34:02.801
You could find a cure
for your paralysis.

34:02.901 --> 34:06.534
There is no cure.

34:06.634 --> 34:07.901
We could help you.

34:08.000 --> 34:10.400
But if you kill us, then you
destroy any chance of that.

34:10.501 --> 34:13.300
My life is over.

34:13.400 --> 34:16.434
The only thing I have left is
the satisfaction of seeing you

34:16.534 --> 34:19.900
pay for what you've done.

34:20.000 --> 34:23.801
And make no mistake - I won't
forget about your lady friends.

34:23.900 --> 34:26.132
You leave them alone.

34:26.234 --> 34:29.367
I just hope they're
better players than you.

34:29.467 --> 34:32.967
You know what Sanctuary's
pumping into your system
right now?

34:33.067 --> 34:37.100
BZ - powerful nerve agent.

34:37.199 --> 34:41.300
It'll infiltrate your
bloodstream, create paralysis.

34:41.400 --> 34:44.000
It eventually will
close down your heart.

34:44.100 --> 34:47.567
Can you feel that numbness
in your fingers yet?

34:47.667 --> 34:52.467
You said you wanted to
understand how I felt.

34:52.567 --> 34:55.367
Soon, you will.

34:55.467 --> 34:58.133
Dennett, don't do this.

34:58.234 --> 35:04.234
[Coughing] Brennan...

35:15.467 --> 35:18.834
Hospital's up ahead.

35:18.934 --> 35:20.100
Rooftop's too narrow.

35:20.200 --> 35:21.934
We need to find
another place to land.

35:22.033 --> 35:23.067
No, there's nowhere
close to bring her down.

35:23.167 --> 35:26.234
We can do this.

35:26.334 --> 35:27.367
It's too narrow.

35:27.467 --> 35:31.701
We'll be fine.

35:41.367 --> 35:43.701
It's going to leave a mark.

35:48.968 --> 35:56.767
[Coughing]

35:56.868 --> 35:58.267
Come on, Jesse,
we gotta go up, man.

35:58.367 --> 35:59.300
Come on.

35:59.400 --> 36:00.234
Come on, buddy, you're
going to make it.

36:00.334 --> 36:03.901
Come on.

36:04.000 --> 36:08.634
[Coughing] Oh...!
Stay with me, buddy.

36:08.734 --> 36:11.133
We're going to make it.

36:11.234 --> 36:28.667
[Coughing]

36:41.267 --> 36:43.601
Thin crust pizza...

36:43.701 --> 36:45.901
What?

36:46.000 --> 36:51.000
My dad used to take us
to this great place.

36:51.100 --> 36:56.033
Giorgio's.

36:56.133 --> 36:59.901
I want to be there now.

37:00.000 --> 37:03.367
Yeah, me too.

37:03.467 --> 37:06.734
Nah, you wouldn't like it.

37:06.834 --> 37:13.601
Just keep talking, man.

37:17.200 --> 37:23.968
There's something I want
to tell you, Brennan.

37:24.067 --> 37:26.334
Yeah, I love you, too, man.

37:26.434 --> 37:28.000
No.

37:28.100 --> 37:31.234
You suck at basketball.

37:31.334 --> 37:33.734
That's the big thing?

37:33.834 --> 37:41.067
That's the big thing,
that you wanted to tell me?

37:41.167 --> 37:43.801
[Coughing] And what you said.

37:43.901 --> 37:49.334
[Wheezing] [coughing]

37:49.434 --> 37:50.434
Jesse!

37:50.534 --> 38:01.234
Jesse!

38:01.334 --> 38:02.834
Hey, William.

38:02.934 --> 38:04.634
You've been a bad boy.

38:04.734 --> 38:05.434
<i>Jesse...</i>

38:05.534 --> 38:06.534
<i>Jesse...</i>

38:06.634 --> 38:10.067
The screen.

38:10.167 --> 38:12.234
My God, he's suffocating him.

38:12.334 --> 38:14.567
I'm going to rip these out of
your head and you won't be

38:14.667 --> 38:16.534
connected to anything anymore.

38:16.634 --> 38:18.400
No, don't do that.

38:18.501 --> 38:20.467
They're going to die if
we don't do something.

38:20.567 --> 38:23.033
No, he's directly
linked to Sanctuary.

38:23.133 --> 38:25.467
Let me try and
override it manually.

38:25.567 --> 38:27.767
I think I can access
the ventilation shafts.

38:27.868 --> 38:31.734
[Coughing]

38:31.834 --> 38:33.834
What did
you do to them?

38:33.934 --> 38:37.167
<i>They're just like me now.</i>

38:37.267 --> 38:40.634
If they die, you die.

38:40.734 --> 38:42.067
I'm in.

38:42.167 --> 38:44.400
Don't you die on me, Jesse!

38:44.501 --> 38:47.434
[Coughing]

38:47.534 --> 38:49.300
Okay, I'm flooding
the chamber with oxygen.

38:49.400 --> 38:51.501
God, I hope we're not too late.

38:51.601 --> 38:54.067
Jesse, come on.

38:54.167 --> 38:55.467
Jesse, come on.

38:55.567 --> 38:56.934
Stay with me, man.

38:57.033 --> 38:59.000
Jesse, stay with me.

38:59.100 --> 38:59.934
Come on.

39:00.033 --> 39:01.033
Come on.

39:01.133 --> 39:03.167
Oh!

39:05.701 --> 39:11.667
Don't you even think of
giving me mouth to mouth.

39:17.701 --> 39:19.667
Brennan, is he okay?

39:19.767 --> 39:21.234
Yeah.

39:21.334 --> 39:24.634
He's okay.

39:24.734 --> 39:29.434
[Breathing heavily]

39:29.534 --> 39:41.067
What about him?

39:41.167 --> 39:44.901
<i>If you unhook me, I'm
trapped in my mind.</i>

39:45.000 --> 39:47.000
<i>It's unbearable.</i>

39:47.100 --> 39:49.901
<i>Kill me.</i>

39:50.000 --> 39:51.934
I don't think you deserve that.

39:52.033 --> 39:52.868
Please!

39:52.968 --> 40:00.667
It's like being in a coffin.

40:04.334 --> 40:07.634
Any last words?

40:09.400 --> 40:12.467
Guess not.

40:12.567 --> 40:13.367
Come on.

40:13.467 --> 40:14.400
We're done here.

40:14.501 --> 40:15.801
Wait.

40:15.901 --> 40:18.667
Just one more little thing.

40:27.667 --> 40:30.901
Just making sure you'll
never be hooked up again.

40:43.868 --> 40:45.000

40:45.100 --> 40:46.701

40:48.467 --> 40:50.167
Hey, there, handsome.

40:50.267 --> 40:52.000
Hey.

40:52.100 --> 40:54.767
Brought you a present.

40:54.868 --> 40:56.067
Hmm.

40:56.167 --> 40:57.501
I like that present.

40:57.601 --> 40:58.901
What's this?

40:59.000 --> 41:00.968
Oh, um, consider it a...

41:01.067 --> 41:05.334
almost going away present.

41:11.133 --> 41:12.834

to load it into the system

computer and put our holograms
through a few paces.

41:18.901 --> 41:20.267
You insane?

41:20.367 --> 41:21.701
It was worth the look, though.

41:21.801 --> 41:22.734
Brennan was right.

41:22.834 --> 41:23.868
Brennan was right.

41:23.968 --> 41:25.834
This is your idea?

41:25.934 --> 41:29.868
I didn't tell them to buy it.

41:29.968 --> 41:33.133
Mind taking care
of this, Sparky?

41:33.234 --> 41:34.234
