01:21.875 --> 01:24.333
It's my dog.

01:24.333 --> 01:27.125

01:27.125 --> 01:29.500
It's my dog.

01:29.500 --> 01:30.959
(FAX MACHINE RINGING)
It's the big, bad dog.

01:47.000 --> 01:49.500
Number one dog,
dog at the top.

01:49.500 --> 01:52.125
Slow down, Fido.
We need to talk.

01:52.125 --> 01:54.041
MAN: (ON PHONE) Yeah?
Vince.

01:54.041 --> 01:55.667
Did you see those
Vita Girl numbers?

01:55.667 --> 01:57.500
We hit that
demographic dead on.

01:57.500 --> 02:01.041
Yeah, looking good.
Talk about what?
Us.

we're 24 hours away

02:02.625 --> 02:04.667

or oblivion.

02:04.667 --> 02:07.166
Are you gonna sign off
on that copy or not?

02:07.166 --> 02:09.750
No.
No? No? What do
you mean no?

02:09.750 --> 02:11.458
Look, Nelson, we've been
killing ourselves with this.

02:11.458 --> 02:13.708
Vince. Vince!
What?

02:13.708 --> 02:15.208
Meet you in 20.

MAN: (ON TV) I remember
a lot of things

02:19.708 --> 02:21.708
about growing up.

Go get 'em, champ.

MAN: (ON TV)
And Dr. Diggity Dogs.

02:27.917 --> 02:31.583
Us? Isn't there some
kind of limit on
"us" talks?

02:31.583 --> 02:33.708
One, okay.
Two, if necessary.

02:33.708 --> 02:35.708
Three, cruel and unusual.

02:35.708 --> 02:37.208
Great dog, big dog.

02:37.208 --> 02:38.750
Forgot about my parents,
didn't you?

02:40.041 --> 02:41.917
I can't make it.
I'm sorry.

02:43.250 --> 02:46.041
Nelson, this is their
third trip to the city.

02:47.375 --> 02:49.542
You could make an effort.

02:50.959 --> 02:52.583
This is important to me.

02:52.583 --> 02:54.834
This account is
very important to me.

02:54.834 --> 02:56.417
Come on, it's Dr. Diggity.

02:56.417 --> 02:58.750
It's practically
an American institution.

02:58.750 --> 03:01.542
American institution.
Dr. Diggity.

03:01.542 --> 03:03.125
An Ameri... No.

03:03.125 --> 03:04.875
Do you know there are
actually people

03:04.875 --> 03:06.583
who don't work
24 hours a day?

03:06.583 --> 03:10.208
They stop, relax,
have lives.

03:14.458 --> 03:17.041
I have a life, Angelica,
and I'm late for it.

03:23.583 --> 03:26.250
Look, I'm not sure
I like the tagline anymore.

03:26.250 --> 03:28.125
It's working too hard.
Needs to be deadpan.

03:28.125 --> 03:29.834
I want to keep
playing with it.

03:29.834 --> 03:31.625
Look, cut it out, man.
The copy's good.

03:31.625 --> 03:33.333
If it ain't broke,
don't fix it.

03:33.333 --> 03:34.542
(CHIMES)

03:34.542 --> 03:37.000
(CHIMES)
That rule applies
to mediocrity.

03:37.000 --> 03:38.583
We want perfection.

03:38.583 --> 03:39.959
What we want
is a check, Nelson.

03:39.959 --> 03:42.000
Bonuses, promotions.
Man, you worry too much.

03:42.000 --> 03:44.750
I worry because
worrying about losing
keeps you winning.

03:44.750 --> 03:48.333
Congrats, Nelson.
You got the ad age
for the Pelican spot.

03:48.333 --> 03:49.708
Give that to me.
Give it, give it!

03:49.708 --> 03:52.291
Look, it says "team."
I'm "team." God!

03:57.875 --> 03:59.625
Morning, Mr. Moss.

03:59.625 --> 04:00.834
Thanks.
Vince.

04:00.834 --> 04:03.458
Beatrice, I'll have the...
The tea.

04:03.458 --> 04:06.625
Hey, did you hear
Edgar Price is coming
out of retirement?

04:06.625 --> 04:07.917
Says he's tired of
being ripped off,

04:07.917 --> 04:09.875
might as well get
back in the game,
rip himself off?

04:09.875 --> 04:11.875
Edgar Price, huh?
Mmm-hmm.

04:11.875 --> 04:13.291
He was the best.

04:13.291 --> 04:15.250
Remember that Mercedes ad
about a trillion years ago?

04:15.250 --> 04:16.834
The car just floating
in outer space,

04:16.834 --> 04:19.666
come right at you,
boom! Genius.

04:19.666 --> 04:21.666
Check this out.
What?

04:24.500 --> 04:26.083
Balance.

04:26.083 --> 04:28.208
How's my dream team?
Got it locked up?

04:28.208 --> 04:30.458
Sure, Chief,
just finessing--

04:30.458 --> 04:32.333
No, no, it's all
locked up, it's locked up.

04:32.333 --> 04:33.959
It's minor, minor details.
Minor details.

04:36.333 --> 04:37.583
See that?
Uh-huh.

04:37.583 --> 04:39.166
Make it happen.
Right.

04:40.875 --> 04:42.750
Red! Blood red!

04:42.750 --> 04:44.708
I can't read this.
Is English her
second language?

04:44.708 --> 04:46.583
I mean this is...
Hey, Nelson.

04:46.583 --> 04:48.000
You're gonna love
these frames.

04:48.000 --> 04:49.166
I took your idea,
you know. I ran with it.

04:49.166 --> 04:50.834
It's still you idea.
It's just better.

04:50.834 --> 04:52.208
Client will love it.

04:55.083 --> 04:57.375
Ethnic.
Ethnic?

04:58.375 --> 05:01.083
Give me a bonfire.
Make it 3/4.

05:01.083 --> 05:02.208
More cleavage,
more dogs.

05:02.208 --> 05:03.750
Nelson, I've got
three girls here.

05:03.750 --> 05:04.708
Let's make this night.

05:04.708 --> 05:06.333
Night? Night.

05:08.375 --> 05:09.542
What's this? Porno?

05:09.542 --> 05:11.708
Well, you said
you wanted edge.

05:13.875 --> 05:15.375
I don't feel it.
There you are.

05:15.375 --> 05:16.500
Blood red.
VINCE: Blood red.

05:16.500 --> 05:18.250
Did you forget your
1:00 at the DMV?

05:18.250 --> 05:19.875
Reschedule.

05:19.875 --> 05:22.041
Beatrice, I don't have
time for this.

05:22.041 --> 05:23.542
Wait until
the presentation's over.

05:23.542 --> 05:25.375
If you don't renew today,

05:25.375 --> 05:27.041
they will suspend
your license,

05:27.041 --> 05:28.708
which means the next time
you get pulled over

05:28.708 --> 05:30.333
they can throw you in jail.

05:30.333 --> 05:32.583
And I bet you don't have
time for that, either.

05:32.583 --> 05:34.291
Nobody beats
the DMV, Nelson,
not even you.

05:35.125 --> 05:37.750
Bye-bye. I got it.

05:37.750 --> 05:40.166
Yeah, yeah.
Gotta feel it.

05:40.166 --> 05:42.125
Yeah, I'm feeling it.
Blood red.

05:42.125 --> 05:43.458
Blood red! Let's go!
Let's bleed!

05:44.250 --> 05:46.083
(BABY CRYING)

05:58.500 --> 05:59.792
Thank you.

06:04.250 --> 06:06.583
All right, they'll
be no talking,

06:06.583 --> 06:09.750
eating, or drinking
during the test.

06:09.750 --> 06:14.000
If your personal hygiene
becomes a distraction,

06:14.000 --> 06:15.375
you'll be asked to leave.

06:19.458 --> 06:21.083
Sorry.

06:22.291 --> 06:23.959
If you need to use
the bathroom,

06:23.959 --> 06:25.375
raise your hand.

06:25.375 --> 06:27.417
Could you pass me
the Columbo, please?

06:28.083 --> 06:29.333
Yeah, the salami.

06:33.625 --> 06:36.458
Thanks.

06:36.458 --> 06:40.959
PROCTOR: You cannot
take the test with you
to the bathroom.

06:40.959 --> 06:43.041
If you do not come back
from the bathroom,

06:43.041 --> 06:45.125
you cannot pass the test.

06:51.291 --> 06:52.417
You may begin.

07:04.083 --> 07:06.166
Falling rock zone?

07:07.667 --> 07:09.208
Oh, Christ.

07:24.291 --> 07:26.667
(WHISPERING)
Hey. Psst. Psst.

07:29.166 --> 07:31.667
Number nine.
True or false?

07:32.000 --> 07:33.333
Oh.

07:35.291 --> 07:37.792
I'm not there yet.
Sorry.

07:39.917 --> 07:41.542
But for 19--

07:41.542 --> 07:42.750
Excuse me.

07:43.875 --> 07:46.417

07:46.417 --> 07:48.583

forward, please.

07:57.959 --> 07:59.208
Me?

07:59.208 --> 08:00.375
You.

08:01.708 --> 08:03.041
With the scarf.

08:03.041 --> 08:04.208
Yes.

08:13.667 --> 08:15.041
I really wasn't cheating.

08:15.041 --> 08:17.417
I mean, why would I cheat
on a DMV test?

08:17.417 --> 08:19.542
You may re-take
the test in 30 days.

08:20.458 --> 08:21.625
(SNORTS)

08:21.625 --> 08:22.959
That's a joke, right?

08:25.250 --> 08:27.917
Thirty days? That's
a whole month.

08:31.917 --> 08:32.917
Great.

08:35.457 --> 08:36.707
Fine.

08:38.582 --> 08:40.207
Guess I'm going.

08:41.917 --> 08:43.291

Nelson Moss for Vince.

09:00.917 --> 09:02.417
Just a moment.
VINCE: Yep?

09:02.417 --> 09:04.125
Hey, did Ruben
tweak the music?

09:04.125 --> 09:05.458
No, he's said it's fine.

09:06.000 --> 09:07.333
Shit!

09:09.291 --> 09:10.583
Cut him.
What?

09:10.583 --> 09:11.959
Get Johnson McDonald.

09:11.959 --> 09:13.500
Give him the sample.
Tell him--

09:13.500 --> 09:15.542
Nelson, you've
lost your mind.

09:15.542 --> 09:17.083
WOMAN: Hey! Hi!

Did you get your license?

09:20.625 --> 09:21.625
VINCE: Look, what we've
gotta do now--
Hey, Vince.

09:21.625 --> 09:23.917
What?
What do you think
about this?

09:23.917 --> 09:25.792
Barking mad for Dr. Diggity.

09:25.792 --> 09:27.250
That sucks.

09:27.250 --> 09:29.959
Congratulations.

09:35.792 --> 09:38.291
Hmm. Can you help me?

09:38.834 --> 09:40.291
Yeah.

09:40.291 --> 09:41.583
Hmm.

09:43.667 --> 09:44.875
That's your van,
isn't it?

09:47.041 --> 09:48.875
Is this your car?

09:48.875 --> 09:51.417
Wow! Nice.

09:51.417 --> 09:53.750
And you can't
drive. Right.

09:53.750 --> 09:54.625
No.

the way that you...

09:58.917 --> 10:01.000
Right. Shit.

10:02.291 --> 10:03.708
How much do you
make a month?

10:03.708 --> 10:05.500
Doesn't look like much.

10:05.500 --> 10:07.041
I'll cover your expenses.

10:07.041 --> 10:11.333
Here. Call my secretary.
We'll work it out.

10:11.333 --> 10:13.708
This quest for redemption,
is it coming from
true remorse,

10:13.708 --> 10:15.375
or are you just scared
my sitting on your car's

10:15.375 --> 10:16.625
gonna cause a big dent?

10:17.333 --> 10:18.542
The dent, I guess.

10:20.000 --> 10:21.542
That's what I thought.

10:27.834 --> 10:29.208
What are you doing?

10:29.208 --> 10:30.375
Buying redemption.

10:31.708 --> 10:35.041
Redemption's not
for sale today, sorry.

10:37.208 --> 10:39.750
Okay. Guess
I'm going to hell.

12:26.625 --> 12:28.208
"Manny, you can
fix nothing."

12:28.208 --> 12:30.291
So then she leaves me
for plumber.

12:30.291 --> 12:31.458
WOMAN: No.
Yeah. Plumber.

12:31.458 --> 12:32.708
WOMAN: Aw. Oh!

12:33.500 --> 12:35.166
Look at that, Manny.

12:35.166 --> 12:36.667
My very own
Prince Charming.

12:40.625 --> 12:42.000
I don't think
I've ever met

12:42.000 --> 12:43.792
such a royal asshole
in my entire life.

12:46.667 --> 12:48.166
So...

12:48.166 --> 12:50.542
Does your mom know you
treat women like hookers,

12:50.542 --> 12:52.417
or did she raise you
to believe

12:52.417 --> 12:55.625
that being nice means
patronizing the whole world?

12:55.625 --> 12:58.000
Uh-oh. I smell trouble.

12:58.000 --> 12:59.667
Can I talk to you?
Yeah.

13:00.083 --> 13:01.208
Bye, Manny.

13:05.750 --> 13:08.417
How'd you find me?
I'm smart.

13:08.417 --> 13:10.500
So, I need a ride.

13:11.166 --> 13:13.083
Is this a joke?

13:13.083 --> 13:15.708
Well, you're the reason
why I can't drive,

13:15.708 --> 13:18.583
so, you know,
the least you can do
is schlep me somewhere.

13:18.583 --> 13:20.417
Come on. It'll be quick,
painless. Where's your car?

13:23.000 --> 13:24.208
Been a ball,

13:24.208 --> 13:25.917
but some of us
have to work.

13:25.917 --> 13:28.250
Okay, please don't make
me throw a tantrum.

13:28.250 --> 13:30.834
Hi, would you like
to get naked with us?
We live here.

13:30.834 --> 13:32.291
We have a tub full
of fudge and vodka.

13:32.291 --> 13:34.208
Ignore her!
Come on, it's
gonna be fun!

13:34.208 --> 13:35.625
Ignore her,
ignore her!

13:35.625 --> 13:36.708
Hey, what are
you doing?

13:37.917 --> 13:40.500
You know what.
You're a flasher.

13:40.500 --> 13:42.000
You're a flasher!
It's gotta be stopped.

13:42.000 --> 13:43.166
Mr. Johnson,
Mrs. Johnson.

13:43.166 --> 13:44.542
Don't walk away,
Mr. Johnson!

13:44.542 --> 13:45.875
I'm gonna call
the police.

13:45.875 --> 13:47.542
He keeps flashing
everybody in this building.

13:47.542 --> 13:49.208
Hey, hey,
what are you, nuts?

13:49.208 --> 13:50.750
I live here.

13:50.750 --> 13:52.166
Do you have
any shame at all?

13:54.041 --> 13:55.750
Well, I just want a ride.

13:56.917 --> 13:58.083
Please?

14:08.375 --> 14:11.083
Oh, by the way,
I'm Sara Deever.

14:12.375 --> 14:13.959
Nice to meet you.

14:16.417 --> 14:19.208
Okay, well, you wanna
get into the right lane
up here.

14:19.208 --> 14:21.417
Just put your
indicator on--
I know how to drive.

14:21.417 --> 14:23.083
Okay.

14:23.083 --> 14:25.458
We want to take the 80
to Oakland, okay?

14:25.458 --> 14:27.417
Oakland.
Yeah.

14:27.417 --> 14:28.959
You said this
would be quick.

14:28.959 --> 14:31.875
I also said
it would be painless.

14:31.875 --> 14:34.834
This is really nice of you
to this for me, Nelson.

14:34.834 --> 14:36.792
And I'm sorry
if I went a little
too far back there,

14:36.792 --> 14:37.792
but I really did
need this ride,

14:37.792 --> 14:39.959
so I really
appreciate it. Thanks.

14:41.625 --> 14:42.959
Right here, right here.

14:51.125 --> 14:52.792
What do you plan
to do with that?

14:54.333 --> 14:56.792
Commit a heinous crime,
what else?

14:56.792 --> 14:58.625
You'll wait for me, right?

14:58.625 --> 14:59.792
Right?

15:03.834 --> 15:05.625
Of course you will.

15:05.625 --> 15:06.834
Shh.

15:30.875 --> 15:32.542
What am I doing?

15:33.834 --> 15:35.333
What am I doing?

Go, go, go, go!

16:04.083 --> 16:05.208
Whoo!

16:14.542 --> 16:16.875
Oh, my God!
That was go great!

16:16.875 --> 16:19.792
Oh! Don't you feel
like Bonnie and Clyde?

16:19.792 --> 16:21.208
No, I don't feel like
Bonnie and Clyde.

16:21.208 --> 16:23.542
Why not?
They got shot, okay?

16:27.667 --> 16:29.417
Don't open it.
I don't want to know.

16:29.417 --> 16:31.750
Don't open it!
Just relax, Nelson.

16:31.750 --> 16:33.667
They're just five little
furry friends.

16:33.667 --> 16:34.834
Say, "Hi, Nelson."

16:34.834 --> 16:36.583
Yeah, somebody
was gonna do

16:36.583 --> 16:38.834
nasty little experiments
on your brains,

16:38.834 --> 16:40.583
but I wouldn't have it.

16:40.583 --> 16:41.667
Say, "No!"

16:46.417 --> 16:48.125
What do you do,
by the way?

16:49.917 --> 16:51.417
I'm in advertising.

16:51.917 --> 16:53.458
Advertising.

16:54.458 --> 16:57.250
So, you enjoy it?

16:57.250 --> 16:59.959
People tend to enjoy
what they're really
good at.

(DOG WHINING)

17:02.583 --> 17:04.208
So, besides your job,

17:04.208 --> 17:06.666
what else makes
you miserable?

17:06.666 --> 17:08.083
I mean, what do
you do for fun?

17:11.333 --> 17:13.208
I didn't think so.

17:13.208 --> 17:14.583
No hobbies?

17:15.250 --> 17:16.625
No diversions?

17:16.625 --> 17:18.500
No kinky obsessions?

17:18.500 --> 17:20.791
For one quick
second there

17:20.791 --> 17:21.916
I really thought
that you were--

17:21.916 --> 17:23.125
Just get in the car.

17:30.333 --> 17:31.291
(HUFFS)

17:34.291 --> 17:37.125
Hey, you want to come up
for a cup of cocoa?

17:37.125 --> 17:39.125
As scintillating as
the evening's been,

17:39.125 --> 17:40.250
I'm afraid not.

17:42.458 --> 17:43.458
Okay.

17:45.667 --> 17:47.375
How about I make
you a deal?

17:47.375 --> 17:49.458
You come up for one cup,
and I'll never ask you

17:49.458 --> 17:51.250
for another ride
as long as I live.

17:51.250 --> 17:52.333
No, thanks.

17:55.166 --> 17:57.125
Okay. Thanks.

17:59.583 --> 18:01.166
I'll see you
tomorrow then, okay?

Whoa, whoa,

18:02.834 --> 18:04.166

whoa, hold on!

18:04.625 --> 18:06.291
Hold on.

18:06.291 --> 18:08.333
8:00, right?
That's good for you.

18:08.333 --> 18:10.792
You, me, Manny the doorman,
that whole thing, huh?

18:28.750 --> 18:30.000
Come in.

18:35.667 --> 18:38.333
There you guys go,
okay? Yeah.

18:47.875 --> 18:49.000
Nelson.

18:49.750 --> 18:51.208
I can help you.

18:52.208 --> 18:54.417
See, I have a gift.

18:54.417 --> 18:56.834
A special ability
to help men with problems.

18:56.834 --> 18:58.667
I don't have
problems.

18:58.667 --> 19:02.250
Ah. Now, see, that usually
is the first sign.

19:02.250 --> 19:04.250
Of what?
Denial.

19:04.250 --> 19:05.750
Denial.

19:05.750 --> 19:07.708
First of all, I think
you work too much.

19:08.417 --> 19:10.041
Really?
Mmm-hmm.

19:10.041 --> 19:11.542
And what do you know
about work?

19:11.542 --> 19:13.542
Plenty.

19:13.542 --> 19:14.917
You admitted
you do nothing else

19:14.917 --> 19:16.041
and it doesn't
make you happy,

19:16.041 --> 19:17.583
so how's that
for screwy logic?

19:17.583 --> 19:20.333
I admitted nothing.
I was silent.

19:20.333 --> 19:22.917
No special interests,
no pets. You hate dogs.

19:22.917 --> 19:24.375
Busted.

19:24.375 --> 19:26.708
Actually, I do have
a pet, a fish.

19:26.708 --> 19:29.542
A fish. Doesn't count.

19:29.542 --> 19:30.792
Cold-blooded. Sorry.

19:30.792 --> 19:34.083
Nope, you are
a walking case study.

19:35.708 --> 19:37.291
Look at you.

19:37.291 --> 19:39.625
You're a workaholic
at such an advanced stage

19:39.625 --> 19:42.250
that your intimacy skills
have withered away

19:42.250 --> 19:43.792
to almost nothing.

19:43.792 --> 19:45.834
Left untreated, Nelson,

19:45.834 --> 19:48.625
you could become
emotionally extinct.

19:48.625 --> 19:50.583
Out of sheer
perverse curiosity,

19:50.583 --> 19:53.583
how does a lunatic
like you help
a guy like me?

19:56.333 --> 19:57.792
You live in a box.

19:59.583 --> 20:01.041
I could lift the lid.

20:01.041 --> 20:02.250
Let some light in.

20:03.458 --> 20:05.083
Wow, that's deep.

20:06.458 --> 20:08.750
I feel almost cured
just hearing it.

20:10.792 --> 20:14.417
Well, if you want my help,

20:14.417 --> 20:16.125
it will require
a commitment on your part.

20:18.291 --> 20:19.959
You have to live with me
here for a month.

20:19.959 --> 20:21.166
(LAUGHS)

20:22.625 --> 20:24.417
No more, no less,

20:24.417 --> 20:25.959
and no work allowed.

20:28.291 --> 20:30.125
You don't even know me,

20:30.125 --> 20:31.834
and you're inviting
me to move in?

20:31.834 --> 20:33.667
Mmm-hmm.

20:33.667 --> 20:36.959
And how's my girlfriend
supposed to feel
about that?

20:38.417 --> 20:39.959
Girlfriend?

20:39.959 --> 20:41.166
You don't have
a girlfriend.

20:43.291 --> 20:46.291
I mean, it's something
that you feel.

20:46.291 --> 20:47.625
There's something
very intimate

20:47.625 --> 20:48.959
that a woman
leaves on a man

20:48.959 --> 20:50.458
that you definitely
don't have.

20:50.458 --> 20:51.834
Her name's Angelica.

20:55.166 --> 20:57.000
Well, I feel sorry
for Angelica.

20:57.542 --> 20:59.041
Great.

21:00.333 --> 21:02.166
I'll relay that to her
when I leave,

21:02.166 --> 21:05.000
which is, uh,
right about now.

21:05.000 --> 21:06.792

21:07.542 --> 21:09.000
We can start midnight.

21:10.083 --> 21:12.208
First of November.

21:12.208 --> 21:13.542
If you're brave enough
to commit,

21:13.542 --> 21:15.375
I will devote myself
entirely to you.

21:17.291 --> 21:19.542
Brave enough,
but not stupid enough.

no more rides,

21:26.834 --> 21:28.708
no more extortion.

21:28.708 --> 21:31.000
Next time you come
into my building,

21:31.000 --> 21:33.083
I really will
call the cops.

hot dogs, safe.

What's in a hot dog?
Don't tell me.

I don't want to know.

He needs food.

He hunts and gathers.

22:31.792 --> 22:33.250
What does he get?

22:34.875 --> 22:36.458
He gets a hot dog.

We're pagans.
We love our rituals.

we're insane.
What do we want?

22:44.291 --> 22:45.708
We want a hot dog!

22:45.708 --> 22:48.583
Let's go straight
to your pre-teen
demographic.

22:48.583 --> 22:50.458
Kids, the little angels.

22:50.458 --> 22:52.583
They're not angels.
They're monsters!

a tuna sandwich.

22:53.917 --> 22:56.083

a tuna sandwich!

We've got the mothers.

We want the daughters.

age-old question.

23:07.333 --> 23:10.625
What does a woman
really want?

23:10.625 --> 23:12.625
You know. I know.

23:13.875 --> 23:15.917
She wants a hot dog.

what I really think
of your campaign.

one of these days

about, burn?

you a wreck!

38:11.500 --> 38:12.708
Now.

38:12.708 --> 38:14.708
I told you.
I gave them away.

38:18.041 --> 38:20.667
I promise
I'll never lie to you.

38:24.959 --> 38:27.458
So...

38:27.458 --> 38:32.250
Would you like
vegan sausage,
vegan bacon...

38:32.250 --> 38:34.291
Yeah, well, that's
all we got now. Huh?

38:34.291 --> 38:36.166
I make it with a lot
of vegan butter

38:36.166 --> 38:38.458
so it gets really nice
and black and crispy.

38:38.458 --> 38:40.375
But if you don't
like it that way,

38:40.375 --> 38:41.917
I won't make it
that way, okay?

38:41.917 --> 38:43.375
Hey, hey!

38:44.750 --> 38:47.083
Three hours sleep last night.

38:47.083 --> 38:50.041
Tried valerian root.
Melatonin.

38:50.041 --> 38:51.708
The Shopping Channel.

38:53.417 --> 38:55.708
You know what did
the trick in the end?
What?

38:55.708 --> 38:57.250
Jimmy Cagney.

38:57.250 --> 38:59.083
Public Enemy.

38:59.083 --> 39:01.917
Violence as a tranquilizer,
how twisted is that?

39:05.250 --> 39:07.166
Ah.

39:07.166 --> 39:09.417
You're looking
very sexy today.

39:09.750 --> 39:11.417
Yeah?
Yeah.

39:11.834 --> 39:13.250
Wow.

39:15.125 --> 39:18.208
I do believe that is
my favorite sweatshirt I see.

39:18.208 --> 39:19.417
SARA: Mmm-hmm.

39:20.792 --> 39:22.083
You must be November.

39:22.792 --> 39:24.458
I must be November?

39:24.458 --> 39:26.041
That's Nelson.

39:27.708 --> 39:29.750
Hey, Nelson. Howdy.

39:30.583 --> 39:31.750
I'm Chaz.

39:31.750 --> 39:32.792
Hey.

39:33.708 --> 39:35.417
You know what?

39:35.417 --> 39:39.125
Keep the sweatshirt.
Looks better on you.

39:39.125 --> 39:42.083
Is this some kind
of a communal, culty,

39:42.083 --> 39:44.000
Squeaky-Charlie
type of deal?

39:44.000 --> 39:47.291
That's very good.
He's very funny.

39:47.291 --> 39:48.667
Much cooler
than October.

39:48.667 --> 39:50.875
What a wanker he was.
All right, I gotta go.

39:50.875 --> 39:52.667
Mmm.
Mmm.

39:52.667 --> 39:55.125
I love you, baby.
I love you.

39:55.125 --> 39:56.917
Are you sure
you don't want any food?

39:56.917 --> 39:58.500
And get fat like you?
Ah.

40:01.166 --> 40:02.792
See you around, Nelson.

40:02.792 --> 40:03.959
NELSON: See ya.

40:07.959 --> 40:10.291
I think I'll pull myself out
of monthly rotation
while I'm ahead.

40:11.875 --> 40:14.458
What? Nelson.

40:15.208 --> 40:17.166
Who the hell was
that? Your pimp?

40:17.166 --> 40:19.291
Chaz?
Chaz lives downstairs.

40:19.291 --> 40:21.041
We just look
after each other.

40:21.041 --> 40:23.166
I think Chaz can
take care of himself.

40:23.166 --> 40:25.000
He just needs
a good night's sleep.

40:25.000 --> 40:26.166
Hello, sweetheart
how are you?

40:26.166 --> 40:28.166
Hey, you guys.
Nelson, these are...

40:28.166 --> 40:29.458
Sorry.

40:29.458 --> 40:31.542
I was trying
to introduce you.

40:31.542 --> 40:34.542
That's Al and Osiris.
They own that bookstore.

40:34.542 --> 40:36.959
They used to be
really close friends
with Jack Kerouac.

40:36.959 --> 40:38.375
I don't care.
I don't read.

40:38.375 --> 40:40.834
Sara, can you spare
15 bucks?

40:40.834 --> 40:42.333
Bruce, I just gave
you those clothes.

40:42.333 --> 40:43.125
Why you gotta be
so greedy?

40:44.875 --> 40:47.417
That's my shirt!
Those are my pants!

40:47.417 --> 40:49.041
Hey! Hey!

40:49.041 --> 40:51.000
SARA: Doesn't it
feel good to give?

40:51.000 --> 40:51.959
Leave me alone!
No.

40:51.959 --> 40:53.834
You November?

40:53.834 --> 40:55.291
Where am I?

40:55.291 --> 40:56.750
Boy, you guys
have to meet.

40:56.750 --> 40:59.834
Nelson, this is Abner.
Abner, Nelson.

40:59.834 --> 41:01.750
Abner's gonna set
a world record
one day, right?

41:01.750 --> 41:03.417
Yeah.
What's today's project?

41:03.417 --> 41:05.875
Standing on one leg.
You wanna time me?

41:05.875 --> 41:08.583
I have to break
the current record
of 300 hours.

41:08.917 --> 41:10.166
No.

41:10.166 --> 41:11.750
Loser.

41:11.750 --> 41:12.708
Get a life.

41:14.166 --> 41:16.166
Good one. (LAUGHS)

41:17.250 --> 41:19.250
You let a 10-year-old
wind you up?

41:19.250 --> 41:21.458
Forget him.
What about you?

41:21.458 --> 41:22.375
You sleep
with half the city,

41:22.375 --> 41:25.041
get the whole
neighborhood involved.

41:25.041 --> 41:27.208
What? You'd prefer
if I was a virgin?

41:27.208 --> 41:28.917
Considering
the alternative, yes.

41:30.583 --> 41:31.875
I'm yours.

41:32.792 --> 41:34.583
All yours.

41:35.500 --> 41:38.375
Look, Sara, you're great.

41:38.375 --> 41:41.375
You're a very sexy,
smart, interesting,

41:41.375 --> 41:44.625
somewhat unusual woman.
But we, uh...

41:45.625 --> 41:48.250
I always think it's best
to clarify issues.

41:48.250 --> 41:51.291
You are the most
egotistical man
I've ever met.

41:51.291 --> 41:53.917
I am talking
about a month.

41:53.917 --> 41:56.000
The truth is,
I don't have a month.

41:56.000 --> 41:57.291
Time is money.

41:57.959 --> 41:59.458
(SIGHS)

42:01.250 --> 42:04.458
Okay, this...
Let's just...

42:04.458 --> 42:07.291
Just how long do you
think you can put

42:07.291 --> 42:09.375
this big, fat lucrative
career of yours on hold?

42:09.375 --> 42:10.959
(STUTTERS) Just...

42:11.917 --> 42:13.542
God, what am I
talking about?

42:13.542 --> 42:15.375
You don't,
you're are unemployed!

42:15.375 --> 42:18.542
You don't have a job!
You got fired, Nelson.

42:18.542 --> 42:20.625
You have nothing
to go back to.

42:22.542 --> 42:24.291
You know, the more
I think about it,

42:24.291 --> 42:27.000
this project of yours
feels like an excuse
to get laid.

42:37.333 --> 42:39.834
Sara.
Sara, I'm sorry. I...

42:39.834 --> 42:41.500
Sara, I didn't mean to...
I didn't think you'd...

42:41.500 --> 42:43.834
I...

42:43.834 --> 42:46.083
I just don't understand why
you're doing this is all.

42:48.417 --> 42:51.834
I told you.
I have my reasons.

42:57.000 --> 42:58.625
Still friends?

42:58.625 --> 43:00.458
Only if you give me
what I want.

43:01.291 --> 43:02.458
(CHUCKLES)

43:02.875 --> 43:04.083
What?

43:04.792 --> 43:05.625
Time.

43:08.500 --> 43:10.166
All I can do is a day.

43:10.166 --> 43:11.333
I'll take it.

43:11.959 --> 43:12.875
Okay.

43:14.333 --> 43:17.125
I'll take it.

43:17.125 --> 43:20.500
Always a thrill to explore
new career possibilities.

43:21.583 --> 43:23.542
How much do you
charge for this?

43:23.542 --> 43:25.166
I don't do this
for the money.

43:25.166 --> 43:26.959
Why do you do it?

43:26.959 --> 43:28.458
Because I like it.

43:28.458 --> 43:29.667
You can take 'em
off the leashes.

43:29.667 --> 43:31.375
Come here. Oh, yes.

43:31.375 --> 43:33.500
You're so excited, I know.

43:33.500 --> 43:35.125
Yeah, go raise some hell.
Come here.

43:35.125 --> 43:36.667
Don't tell your mom, okay?

43:36.667 --> 43:38.000
You can let 'em go,
you know, Nelson.

43:38.500 --> 43:40.166

So, tell me.
When was the last time

44:55.750 --> 44:57.208
you spent a whole day
outside?

45:00.708 --> 45:02.917
When my parents
dragged me to Alcatraz

45:02.917 --> 45:04.333
for the day
at the age of nine.

45:04.333 --> 45:05.542
Wow.

45:06.917 --> 45:09.083
Now you tell me
something.
Anything.

45:09.083 --> 45:12.166
What was so enlightening
about what we did today?

45:12.166 --> 45:13.834
Why is letting
some dogs go wild

45:13.834 --> 45:16.417
a better way to live
than my way?

45:16.417 --> 45:18.750
I mean, granted,
it was mildly amusing.

45:18.750 --> 45:21.291
But I gotta tell you,
my third eye didn't open.

45:21.291 --> 45:23.458
Well, these things
take time,

45:23.458 --> 45:25.750
and you don't have time.

45:25.750 --> 45:28.458
No, seriously, it's
a question of values.

45:28.458 --> 45:30.834
Why is doing something
fundamentally trivial

45:30.834 --> 45:34.291
better than living
a responsible life,

45:34.291 --> 45:37.000
boring as that
might seem to you?

45:37.000 --> 45:40.667
And who made you
the expert,
the doctor, the guru?

45:40.667 --> 45:43.291
Why do you have
all the answers?

45:43.291 --> 45:46.625
Well, I used to own
this company
called Sublime Pets.

45:46.625 --> 45:48.000
Uh-huh.

45:48.000 --> 45:51.166
No, I really did.
And then I quit

45:51.166 --> 45:54.208
because it wasn't
fun anymore, you know?

45:54.208 --> 45:56.708
NELSON: Was that before
or after you toured
as a stand-up comedienne?

45:56.708 --> 45:58.625
Mmm-mmm.
I never did that.

46:01.500 --> 46:03.667
Well, this...

46:03.667 --> 46:05.625
This will be
really good for you.

46:05.625 --> 46:07.291
Uh...

Sharpen your instincts.

46:10.333 --> 46:13.000
No, no. (CHUCKLES)

of instincts.

46:18.041 --> 46:20.000
if you get
your hands off me,

46:21.083 --> 46:22.500
is...

46:22.500 --> 46:24.792
I run around and
you lose track of me,

46:24.792 --> 46:27.834
then you...
No, no peeking.

get close.

going to be upset
when I leave tonight?

47:27.083 --> 47:28.792
I told you one day.

47:30.291 --> 47:31.792
Yeah, of course.

47:35.291 --> 47:37.083
Mitch was my October.

47:39.417 --> 47:40.417
(SARA CHUCKLES)

47:41.542 --> 47:43.583
He was so shy.

47:43.583 --> 47:46.083
I think he was
the shyest man
I've ever met.

47:46.917 --> 47:47.875
So,

47:49.417 --> 47:52.041
we focused
on strengthening
his confidence.

47:54.250 --> 47:56.291
And was the patient cured?

47:58.417 --> 48:01.125
Oh, yeah. My, um...

48:02.625 --> 48:04.250
My treatment
was so effective

48:04.250 --> 48:07.125
that we had to terminate
the month early.

48:09.166 --> 48:10.917
And what
about September?

48:12.792 --> 48:14.458
No. No September.

48:17.458 --> 48:18.792
What?

48:21.250 --> 48:23.625
You didn't think
I was weird about it
or something, did you?

48:26.458 --> 48:28.333
And you
and all these guys...

48:30.667 --> 48:32.291
Does it really matter
that much to you?

48:34.708 --> 48:36.959
Why a month?

48:36.959 --> 48:40.041
Because it's long enough
to be meaningful

48:40.041 --> 48:41.834
and short enough
to stay out of trouble.

Oh, no, no.
No pay, no pay.

01:03:39.667 --> 01:03:42.041
You eat two.
You too skinny.

01:03:42.041 --> 01:03:43.708
I'm too skinny?
Yeah, yeah.

01:03:43.708 --> 01:03:45.542
Should be fat.
Much better.

01:03:45.542 --> 01:03:47.583
Whoo!
Thank you.

01:03:49.375 --> 01:03:51.208
...the party,
and the sound,

01:03:51.208 --> 01:03:52.917
and everything.
I mean, I'm totally...

01:03:54.875 --> 01:03:56.875
It's just insane.

01:03:56.875 --> 01:03:58.959
I looked up your website
the other night.

01:03:59.750 --> 01:04:01.250
Your sister's pretty.

01:04:01.250 --> 01:04:03.083
Looks a lot like you.

01:04:03.083 --> 01:04:05.750
Yeah, well, it's not
my website anymore.

01:04:05.750 --> 01:04:07.583
It's not my anything
anymore.

01:04:08.458 --> 01:04:09.583
Why'd you quit?

01:04:11.917 --> 01:04:14.625
It started out small
and then it got big.

01:04:14.625 --> 01:04:17.250
That's generally considered
a good thing in business.

01:04:18.333 --> 01:04:20.041
Yeah, well,
everything got big.

01:04:20.917 --> 01:04:23.750
Egos. Lives. Desires.

01:04:25.458 --> 01:04:27.083
I didn't like
the big me.

01:04:28.291 --> 01:04:29.250
I wasn't very happy.

01:04:31.250 --> 01:04:33.083
You want to know
the most amazing
part of it all?

01:04:34.125 --> 01:04:35.875
What?

01:04:35.875 --> 01:04:39.417
I got out before
it got really big.

01:04:40.166 --> 01:04:41.500
Can you imagine that?

01:04:41.500 --> 01:04:43.458
No, I can't imagine you

01:04:43.458 --> 01:04:44.834
with millions
and millions of dollars.

01:04:44.834 --> 01:04:48.166
(LAUGHS)

01:04:48.166 --> 01:04:50.333
CHAZ: Did you change
the beans or something?

01:04:50.333 --> 01:04:51.834
SARA: Yeah.

01:04:51.834 --> 01:04:53.500
It's hazelnut.
You don't like it?

01:04:54.417 --> 01:04:55.792
Honestly?

01:04:55.792 --> 01:04:57.458
It tastes like camel piss.

01:04:57.458 --> 01:04:59.125
Let's stick
to the classics in future.

01:04:59.125 --> 01:05:00.625
Excuse me.

01:05:00.625 --> 01:05:02.000
Privacy.
Heard of it?

01:05:03.500 --> 01:05:05.417
Very impressive set of pecs
you got there, Nelson.

01:05:05.417 --> 01:05:07.083
Do you work out, then?

01:05:07.083 --> 01:05:08.834
Me, I haven't got time.

01:05:08.834 --> 01:05:10.458
Your pecs, on the other hand,
darling,

01:05:10.458 --> 01:05:12.625
are just edible.

01:05:12.625 --> 01:05:15.250
(SCOFFS)
Now, don't forget,
dinner's at 8:00.

01:05:15.250 --> 01:05:17.458
It's dressy,
'cause we're gonna eat,

01:05:17.458 --> 01:05:19.625
and we are
going dancing.
SARA: Whoo!

01:05:19.625 --> 01:05:21.708
We're gonna see if
Last of the Mohicans here
has got rhythm.

01:05:22.333 --> 01:05:24.333
(LAUGHS)

01:05:24.333 --> 01:05:26.000
Doesn't that guy know how
to make his own coffee?

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:26.959
(LAUGHS)

01:05:31.417 --> 01:05:32.959
You ready to go?

01:05:32.959 --> 01:05:34.333
Yeah.
Okay, good.

01:05:34.333 --> 01:05:36.792
'Cause I told Chaz, Cherry
we'd be on time.

01:05:36.792 --> 01:05:40.166
Oh, we're calling everyone
by their first
and last names now?

01:05:40.166 --> 01:05:42.000
I don't wanna waste my night
with Chaz, Cherry.

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:44.667
I want to get naked
with Sara Deever.

01:05:44.667 --> 01:05:46.500
(SARA GIGGLES)

01:05:46.500 --> 01:05:48.000
You look beautiful.
Hmm.

01:05:49.542 --> 01:05:51.166
Thank you, Nelson Moss.

01:05:52.500 --> 01:05:55.667
Come on, you won't be bored.
I promise.

01:05:55.667 --> 01:05:57.208
Chaz, Cherry's a great cook.

01:06:06.542 --> 01:06:08.375
Yoo-hoo!
We're here.

01:06:08.375 --> 01:06:10.041
Oh! Hallelujah!

01:06:10.041 --> 01:06:12.041
And we're hungry.
Ah, it's too late.

01:06:12.041 --> 01:06:13.917
I sold you dinner
to the homeless.

01:06:14.708 --> 01:06:16.667
Nelson, look at you.

01:06:16.667 --> 01:06:18.333
Didn't recognize you
with your clothes on.

01:06:18.333 --> 01:06:19.417
(SARA CHUCKLES)

01:06:19.417 --> 01:06:20.875
Nelson, you've met Chaz.

01:06:22.500 --> 01:06:24.208
This is Cherry.
Enchante.

(MUSIC PLAYING IN BACKGROUND)

01:06:27.792 --> 01:06:28.875
CHAZ: Oh, watch the nails.

01:06:30.500 --> 01:06:31.750
Thanks very much.

01:06:32.333 --> 01:06:33.041
Hmm.
Wow.

01:06:34.333 --> 01:06:35.375
Wow.

Oh, my God!

Sweetheart! He says
I look like Divine.

01:06:45.625 --> 01:06:47.667
Oh, that's awful.

01:06:47.667 --> 01:06:49.417
Although you could
lose a few pounds.
Stop it.

01:06:49.417 --> 01:06:50.792
Stop it. Bitch.

01:06:50.792 --> 01:06:52.166
Brandy, this is Nelson.

01:06:52.166 --> 01:06:54.083
Nelson, this is Brandy.

01:06:54.083 --> 01:06:56.250
Hi.
Oh, he is handsome.

01:06:56.250 --> 01:06:57.959
Put it back in your pants.

01:06:57.959 --> 01:07:00.542
Grab a drink, Nelson.

01:07:00.542 --> 01:07:02.750
You all right? You seem
a little bit uncomfortable.

01:07:02.750 --> 01:07:04.250
Looking a wee bit peaky.

01:07:04.250 --> 01:07:05.917
Come over here and let me
loosen you up a little bit.

01:07:05.917 --> 01:07:06.875
Just one top.

01:07:06.875 --> 01:07:09.250
CHAZ: Hey, is the music,
maybe?

01:07:09.250 --> 01:07:11.750
No, it's great.
'Cause we've got some, um,

(CLEARS THROAT) No.
Or is it the decor?

(GIGGLING)

01:07:24.583 --> 01:07:26.333
You're in dresses.

01:07:26.333 --> 01:07:28.667
Well, this isn't a dress.
This is a sequin sensation.

01:07:29.291 --> 01:07:30.417
Cheers.

01:07:32.917 --> 01:07:34.417
That's not a dress.

01:07:34.417 --> 01:07:36.166
CHAZ: Oh, God, lassie.
Come on.

01:07:37.500 --> 01:07:39.458

01:07:39.458 --> 01:07:41.083
I'm hungry to have
some delish.

Do you want those?
Thanks very much.

Wow. Did you make that?

Mmm-hmm.

I don't believe it.

01:08:05.458 --> 01:08:06.875
You know what's
a very thin line

01:08:06.875 --> 01:08:09.208
is your outfit.

you get a decent place
on the dance floor,

your dancing shoes?

What?

been doing this?

I can't... I can't talk.

01:11:23.375 --> 01:11:24.458
I can't talk right now.

01:11:25.542 --> 01:11:27.166
I said I can't
talk to you right now.

01:11:29.125 --> 01:11:30.208
(BEEPS)

01:11:33.333 --> 01:11:34.500
Is everything okay?

01:11:38.625 --> 01:11:40.166
Ten guesses who that was.

01:11:41.333 --> 01:11:42.375
Oh, shit.

01:11:44.542 --> 01:11:45.667
So...

01:11:46.667 --> 01:11:48.041
How long has it been going on?

01:11:48.041 --> 01:11:50.291
It's not what you think.
How long have you been
talking to her

01:11:50.291 --> 01:11:52.708
behind my back?
Sweetheart, do you really
want to talk about this now?

01:12:03.834 --> 01:12:05.750
No. I'm sorry.

01:12:08.667 --> 01:12:10.959
Guys,
I don't think I'm gonna go
dancing tonight.

01:12:10.959 --> 01:12:12.333
I feel so tired.
No.

01:12:12.333 --> 01:12:13.875
Come on, sweetheart,
come on.

01:12:17.250 --> 01:12:19.458
(DOOR OPENS, CLOSES)

01:12:21.959 --> 01:12:23.083
What was that all about?

01:12:26.125 --> 01:12:28.750
She gets migraines,
you know.

01:12:30.166 --> 01:12:31.625
Terrible headaches.

01:12:31.625 --> 01:12:33.083
No, the phone call.

01:12:34.083 --> 01:12:35.083
Who was that?

01:12:35.792 --> 01:12:36.959
Her sister.

01:12:40.750 --> 01:12:43.417
It's a long story, and I am
not going to tell it.

01:13:06.625 --> 01:13:07.959
Hey!

01:13:07.959 --> 01:13:09.834
I'm sorry
about what...

01:13:09.834 --> 01:13:12.083
What happened down there.
That's okay.

01:13:12.083 --> 01:13:14.166
Gives me a little boost
to know that
you're not perfect.

01:13:14.166 --> 01:13:15.333
(CHUCKLES)

01:13:15.333 --> 01:13:16.750
Feeling better?

01:13:16.750 --> 01:13:18.500
Yeah, I'm fine.

01:13:18.500 --> 01:13:20.166
Chaz told me it was
your sister on the phone.

01:13:22.583 --> 01:13:23.959
Why does it upset you so much?

01:13:29.625 --> 01:13:33.500
Remember talking about
getting naked? (CHUCKLES)

01:13:33.500 --> 01:13:35.625
Naked with Sara Deever.
I think that's a good time

01:13:35.625 --> 01:13:36.750
for that right now. Come on.

01:13:36.750 --> 01:13:38.875
Don't dodge me. Talk to me.
Come. No.

01:13:38.875 --> 01:13:41.333
Come on. Come get naked
with me.
What happened?

01:13:44.500 --> 01:13:45.500
That's not fair.

01:13:46.708 --> 01:13:48.166
You expect me to be
so honest,

01:13:49.333 --> 01:13:50.542
so forthcoming.

01:13:53.708 --> 01:13:54.500
I do.

01:13:56.333 --> 01:13:57.792
Because it's your month,
Nelson.

01:13:58.542 --> 01:13:59.667
Not mine.

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:03.625
Come on, you don't
want to hear about

01:14:03.625 --> 01:14:05.041
stupid family stuff.

01:14:07.500 --> 01:14:08.667
Don't be mad.

01:14:09.583 --> 01:14:10.834
Please.

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:13.542
Please.

01:14:13.875 --> 01:14:15.000
Please.

01:14:34.750 --> 01:14:36.041
You're not feeling well,
are you?

01:14:43.083 --> 01:14:45.834
Maybe tomorrow
we'll get naked.

01:14:46.750 --> 01:14:47.583
And tonight,

01:14:49.208 --> 01:14:50.417
we'll wear PJs.

01:14:52.208 --> 01:14:53.375
(LAUGHS)

01:15:00.708 --> 01:15:03.083
NELSON: Every woman I know
spends $200 on a haircut.

01:15:04.166 --> 01:15:07.417
You use a vacuum cleaner.

01:15:07.417 --> 01:15:09.250
Quit trying
to change the subject.

01:15:12.125 --> 01:15:13.583
You made a commitment,
Nelson.

01:15:13.583 --> 01:15:14.959
Our time isn't over.

01:15:15.917 --> 01:15:16.917
It's one meeting.

01:15:19.208 --> 01:15:21.458
Why is going to some pow-wow

01:15:21.458 --> 01:15:24.333
with this slicko guy Vince
such a big deal?

01:15:24.333 --> 01:15:26.417
Because it's probably
the chance of a lifetime,

01:15:26.417 --> 01:15:28.500
that's why.

01:15:28.500 --> 01:15:29.875
Well, if it's
a whole lifetime,

01:15:29.875 --> 01:15:32.625
why don't you just postpone it
for one more week.

01:15:32.625 --> 01:15:35.750
Sara, when Edgar Price
says he'll meet you,

01:15:35.750 --> 01:15:37.917
you don't say, "Wait,
how about next month?"

01:15:37.917 --> 01:15:40.250
You say, "Thank you.
I'll be there."

01:15:40.250 --> 01:15:41.583
He's one of the greats.

01:15:42.208 --> 01:15:43.375
Where's my phone?

01:15:44.917 --> 01:15:45.959
I hate it.

01:15:48.125 --> 01:15:49.417
SARA: Nelson!

01:15:52.125 --> 01:15:53.291
Nelson!

01:15:55.875 --> 01:15:57.375
Damn it!

01:15:57.375 --> 01:15:59.333
VINCE: We can take
anything and just...

01:15:59.333 --> 01:16:01.125
Sell it, make it work.
Exactly.

01:16:01.125 --> 01:16:03.625
I mean, we've done
very well with, uh,

01:16:03.625 --> 01:16:06.500
Pelican Beer.
Actually, I'm sure
you're aware of the ad...

01:16:06.500 --> 01:16:07.917
No, I wasn't.

01:16:07.917 --> 01:16:10.834
It just actually won
the Ad Age award for that...
Oh, did you?

01:16:10.834 --> 01:16:12.959
I think that was
last year's spot.

01:16:12.959 --> 01:16:16.500
So, we have a symbiosis,
the two of us, as a team...

01:16:16.500 --> 01:16:18.333
We know a lot of guys

01:16:18.333 --> 01:16:20.333
who do this for the awards,
Mr. Price.

01:16:20.333 --> 01:16:22.291
Yeah, but that's not to say
that we don't get the awards.

01:16:22.291 --> 01:16:23.333
But still...

01:16:24.291 --> 01:16:26.458
We're not about the acclaim.

01:16:26.458 --> 01:16:29.333
Hand-holding
and dinners, or...

01:16:29.333 --> 01:16:31.000
Sending prostitutes
to the client.

01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:32.500
Prostitutes?

01:16:32.500 --> 01:16:34.041
Who, uh, who sends
prostitutes?

01:16:34.041 --> 01:16:35.458
Who doesn't?

01:16:36.542 --> 01:16:37.792
We're about the work.

01:16:38.500 --> 01:16:40.375
If the work is great,

01:16:40.375 --> 01:16:41.625
it speaks for itself.

01:16:42.500 --> 01:16:44.000
That's all I need to know.

01:16:45.500 --> 01:16:48.125
But are you married?
Any kids?

01:16:48.125 --> 01:16:50.083
Oh, no, we've avoided
the family thing

01:16:50.083 --> 01:16:51.417
for quite some time.

01:16:51.417 --> 01:16:53.542
Uh, you know.
Most of our lives.

01:16:53.542 --> 01:16:55.375
Good. Because if you're
worried about

01:16:55.375 --> 01:16:57.542
quality of life
or paternity leave

01:16:57.542 --> 01:16:59.959
or any of that other
New Age crap,

01:16:59.959 --> 01:17:02.792
much as I like you,
we can stop right here.

01:17:02.792 --> 01:17:04.625
I want to be your
full-time commitment.

01:17:05.875 --> 01:17:07.500
I can do that.

01:17:07.500 --> 01:17:10.208
(SIGHS) We still had a whole
two weeks to go, you know?

01:17:10.208 --> 01:17:11.458
What's two weeks?

01:17:11.458 --> 01:17:13.083
You're gonna kick him out
in the end anyway. Good shot.

01:17:13.083 --> 01:17:14.083
Thanks.

01:17:15.708 --> 01:17:16.875
You know what
I should have done?

01:17:16.875 --> 01:17:18.166
I should have
locked him in there.

01:17:19.583 --> 01:17:20.708
I should have
tied him to the bed,

01:17:20.708 --> 01:17:21.750
that's what
I should have done.

01:17:21.750 --> 01:17:22.875
You mean, you didn't?

01:17:24.583 --> 01:17:26.667
Wouldn't have stopped him.

01:17:26.667 --> 01:17:27.583
You know, you can't
force people

01:17:27.583 --> 01:17:29.542
to do things they
don't want to do.

01:17:29.542 --> 01:17:33.000
That's the whole point
of this thing, isn't it?

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:34.875
Besides, I know guys
like Nelson.

01:17:37.250 --> 01:17:39.708
You might have bitten off
more than you can chew
this time.

01:17:39.708 --> 01:17:40.750
Oh!

01:17:43.041 --> 01:17:44.417
That's what I like about him.

01:17:47.041 --> 01:17:49.750
It's also what scares
the living hell out of me.

01:17:49.750 --> 01:17:51.333
VINCE: Yeah,
just so you know,

01:17:51.333 --> 01:17:53.959
um, we've got a couple
of great clients

01:17:53.959 --> 01:17:56.417
in our hip pockets,
plus some leads
on some new accounts.

01:17:56.417 --> 01:17:58.750
So we come to you
fully loaded.

01:17:58.750 --> 01:18:01.041
You're not selling me
a car, Holland.

01:18:01.041 --> 01:18:03.208
And frankly, I'm not overly
impressed with you anyway,

01:18:03.208 --> 01:18:05.750
but your reputation
precedes you.

01:18:05.750 --> 01:18:07.542
And if I have
to take him to get you,

01:18:07.917 --> 01:18:09.417
I will.

01:18:09.417 --> 01:18:12.000
So, here's my offer.

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:14.083
It's good as long
as we're at this table.

01:18:14.083 --> 01:18:15.250
Ow!
(CLATTERING)

01:18:15.250 --> 01:18:17.417
Oh, my, I'm so...

01:18:17.417 --> 01:18:19.250
Sorry.
Excuse me.

01:18:19.750 --> 01:18:20.875
That's okay.

01:18:20.875 --> 01:18:21.959
Stop it.

01:18:24.625 --> 01:18:26.583
You know, sweetie...

01:18:26.583 --> 01:18:28.417
We are what we do
in this world,

01:18:28.417 --> 01:18:30.250
and you're a waitress.

01:18:30.250 --> 01:18:32.792
All that requires
is that you bring the food

01:18:32.792 --> 01:18:35.291
and the drink
to and from the table

01:18:35.291 --> 01:18:36.667
without making a mess.

01:18:36.667 --> 01:18:37.667
That's it.

01:18:38.417 --> 01:18:40.625
So, when you screw up

01:18:40.625 --> 01:18:43.250
something as incredibly
simple as that,

01:18:43.250 --> 01:18:45.458
it doesn't say a whole
hell of a lot about you,
does it?

01:18:46.458 --> 01:18:47.917
I'm... I'm sorry.

01:18:49.959 --> 01:18:51.375
If you gave her
a penny for her thoughts,

01:18:51.375 --> 01:18:52.667
you'd get change.

01:18:53.667 --> 01:18:54.834
They ought to fire her.

01:18:55.417 --> 01:18:57.667
I always say, a bad hire

01:18:57.667 --> 01:19:00.291
strengthens
the competition's hand.

01:19:00.291 --> 01:19:03.542
A good general
feeds off his enemy.

01:19:03.542 --> 01:19:05.959
Actually Sun Tzu
said that last line

01:19:07.208 --> 01:19:08.125
in The Art of War.

01:19:09.125 --> 01:19:10.125
You're right, Nelson.

01:19:11.333 --> 01:19:12.500
You're very smart.

01:19:25.667 --> 01:19:27.166
Nelson...

01:19:27.166 --> 01:19:28.291
Take a look, buddy.

01:19:31.708 --> 01:19:32.834
(CLEARS THROAT)

01:19:37.750 --> 01:19:38.959
Not interested.

01:19:41.375 --> 01:19:42.792
You don't like my offer?

01:19:44.667 --> 01:19:46.458
It's not the offer
I don't like.

01:19:47.834 --> 01:19:49.667
(SIGHS) It's you.

01:19:51.917 --> 01:19:52.667
(SCOFFS)

01:19:54.417 --> 01:19:56.625
Nelson, wait... Nelson!

01:19:56.625 --> 01:19:58.250
You know what, I'm...
This is not...

01:19:58.250 --> 01:19:59.500
I hope you can afford this.

01:20:00.500 --> 01:20:01.708
Uh...

01:20:02.750 --> 01:20:03.875
Shit.

01:20:05.250 --> 01:20:06.375
Oh, Jesus Christ.

01:20:08.625 --> 01:20:09.750
What the hell
is wrong with you?

01:20:09.750 --> 01:20:11.750
You just shit in God's face.
Do you realize that?

01:20:11.750 --> 01:20:13.375
If that's your God,
you're in big trouble.

01:20:13.375 --> 01:20:14.834
The guy's not for me.

01:20:14.834 --> 01:20:16.583
He's not for you?
Well, he is you, man!

01:20:16.583 --> 01:20:17.917
You're cloned
from the same DNA.
What're you

01:20:17.917 --> 01:20:19.166
talking about?
I am nothing like that man.

01:20:19.166 --> 01:20:20.875
If I am, shoot me!
Well, where's the gun?
Shoot me!

01:20:20.875 --> 01:20:22.083
This is my career, too,
Nelson!

01:20:22.083 --> 01:20:23.542
You just blew it
in there!

01:20:23.542 --> 01:20:26.208
What is going on, man?

01:20:26.208 --> 01:20:27.875
I know, I know what it is.
It's the girl, isn't it?

01:20:27.875 --> 01:20:29.166
Your mystery date.
The new mystery woman.

01:20:29.166 --> 01:20:30.417
What's her name?

01:20:30.417 --> 01:20:32.208
What's her...
Don't ignore me, Nelson!

01:20:32.208 --> 01:20:33.375
What's her name?

01:20:33.375 --> 01:20:34.708
Sara.

01:20:34.708 --> 01:20:36.125
Don't you see
what's happening, man?

01:20:36.125 --> 01:20:37.875
She has got
your balls in a jar,

01:20:37.875 --> 01:20:39.041
and you don't even...
I'm your friend.

01:20:39.041 --> 01:20:40.708
I wouldn't lie to you.
That's what's happening.

01:20:40.708 --> 01:20:42.917
You blew it in there,
Nelson.
Vince...

01:20:42.917 --> 01:20:44.417
I'm sorry I cost you--
I don't need your...

01:20:44.417 --> 01:20:46.750
I don't need
your pity, Nelson!
You blew it!

01:20:46.750 --> 01:20:48.083
You're a loser, Nelson!
