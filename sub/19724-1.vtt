<i>Let's take this video
to the Idaho side of the park.</i>

01:25.285 --> 01:27.286
But <i> to get to Idaho,
you go out the west entrance.</i>

01:27.288 --> 01:28.587
<i>The west entrance?
Okay.</i>

01:28.589 --> 01:30.656
Is that the region where, um...

01:30.658 --> 01:32.658
Have you heard of this
constitutional loophole thing?

01:32.660 --> 01:34.226
Is that the region
where that is?

01:34.228 --> 01:36.161
Constitutional loophole?
I'm not following that.

01:36.163 --> 01:37.563
You never read any
articles about that stuff?

01:38.431 --> 01:39.698
No.
- Okay.

01:40.466 --> 01:40.467
Thanks a lot.

01:40.468 --> 01:42.801
Here you go.
- Thank you.

01:42.803 --> 01:43.802
Have a great day.
- I will.

01:47.707 --> 01:49.341
Knows nothing.

01:49.343 --> 01:50.576
No one knows anything.

02:02.755 --> 02:05.524
<i>Yellowstone national park.</i>

02:05.526 --> 02:07.226
<i>Around every corner
is a reminder</i>

02:07.228 --> 02:08.426
<i>of how still life can be.</i>

02:10.295 --> 02:11.730
<i>How vast it can be.</i>

02:13.867 --> 02:15.267
<i>How true it can be.</i>

02:16.503 --> 02:18.303
<i>Until it isn't.</i>

02:21.406 --> 02:21.407
<i>Yellowstone woke up</i>

02:21.408 --> 02:23.809
<i>to what has to be
the worst crime</i>

02:23.811 --> 02:25.644
<i>in the national park's history.</i>

02:26.479 --> 02:27.713
<i>A bizarre triple homicide,</i>

02:27.713 --> 02:27.565
<i>where the murderer immediately</i>

02:27.715 --> 02:30.449
<i>turned himself in
and confessed.</i>

02:31.518 --> 02:32.851
<i>First victim
was by the fire.</i>

02:35.656 --> 02:38.323
The second one, I don't know,
maybe 10 feet from it.

02:41.695 --> 02:43.829
This is where
the third victim was shot.

02:43.831 --> 02:45.264
Okay.
- By the back wheel?

02:48.800 --> 02:48.652
<i>I just really
can't understand</i>

02:48.802 --> 02:52.704
<i>how a man can commit all these
horrific crimes, you know,</i>

02:53.406 --> 02:54.806
<i>and then just...</i>

02:54.808 --> 02:56.408
<i>Talk about it like he's</i>

02:56.410 --> 02:58.343
reciting the details
of a traffic violation.

03:00.680 --> 03:03.415
<i>Nobody could
have expected</i>

03:03.417 --> 03:06.952
the side swipe that occurred.

03:06.954 --> 03:09.788
<i>We're talking about
a confessed murderer here.</i>

03:09.790 --> 03:12.558
<i>One who showed no remorse,
no regret.</i>

03:12.560 --> 03:14.459
This guy should have been
put away for life.

03:17.663 --> 03:17.664
<i>There is no resolution.</i>

03:17.665 --> 03:21.800
<i>I mean, it's just this thing
hanging over us.</i>

03:21.802 --> 03:23.435
<i>I think most of the country,
most of the world,</i>

03:23.437 --> 03:24.903
<i>hasn't even heard of this.</i>

03:24.905 --> 03:26.672
Well, this whole thing
was swept under the rug.

03:27.807 --> 03:28.941
It's an embarrassment.

03:42.488 --> 03:44.456
<i>My name is Julian pinder.</i>

03:44.456 --> 03:44.308
<i>As a documentary filmmaker,</i>

03:44.458 --> 03:47.726
<i>I believe anything in life
can be fascinating</i>

03:47.728 --> 03:50.329
<i>when you delve
into the details.</i>

03:50.331 --> 03:53.232
<i>I find characters and I
tell a story through them.</i>

03:53.234 --> 03:56.768
<i>Their words, their actions,
their eyes.</i>

03:56.770 --> 03:58.570
<i>But it's a completely
different story</i>

03:58.572 --> 03:59.905
<i>when the camera turns on you.</i>

03:59.907 --> 04:00.839
It's nice.

04:02.375 --> 04:03.442
How's that?

04:07.512 --> 04:07.513
<i>I first heard of this story</i>

04:07.514 --> 04:11.483
<i>when I received an email
not too long ago.</i>

04:12.618 --> 04:12.619
<i>Three boys were murdered</i>

04:12.620 --> 04:16.588
<i>in a remote part of
yellowstone national park.</i>

04:17.857 --> 04:20.459
<i>What struck me was
that the murders took place</i>

04:20.461 --> 04:23.729
<i>on April 27th, 2009,</i>

04:23.731 --> 04:24.963
<i>nearly five years ago.</i>

04:26.366 --> 04:27.866
<i>Why was I being sent this now?</i>

04:31.871 --> 04:37.342
<i>The email came from
chasingbison bear@gmail. Com.</i>

04:37.344 --> 04:40.012
<i>I was unsuccessful in contacting
the source of the email.</i>

04:40.780 --> 04:42.481
<i>But when I did a search,</i>

04:42.483 --> 04:45.384
<i>incredible images
immediately surfaced</i>

04:45.386 --> 04:47.753
<i>of a bear chasing a burnt bison</i>

04:47.755 --> 04:50.289
<i>down a winter road
in yellowstone.</i>

04:50.291 --> 04:52.958
<i>Incredible and unbelievable.</i>

04:52.960 --> 04:54.993
<i>A chase like none other
seen before.</i>

04:57.397 --> 04:59.931
<i>These images would
prove to be a metaphor</i>

05:00.767 --> 05:02.801
<i>for the yellowstone murders.</i>

05:08.776 --> 05:11.476
<i>David drabeck,
Thomas Burnett and Cody Gibbs</i>

05:11.478 --> 05:13.512
<i>were camping in
yellowstone national park,</i>

05:13.512 --> 05:13.364
<i>when tragedy struck.</i>

05:13.514 --> 05:17.516
<i>A chance encounter
with a stranger proved fatal</i>

05:17.518 --> 05:19.751
<i>when williston resident,
Dwayne Nelson,</i>

05:19.753 --> 05:21.353
<i>killed the young men</i>

05:21.355 --> 05:22.921
<i>in a self-described
moment of insanity.</i>

05:22.923 --> 05:24.723
<i>Shocking news of
a three person homicide</i>

05:24.723 --> 05:24.575
<i>early this morning.</i>

05:24.725 --> 05:26.692
<i>The suspect turned himself in</i>

05:26.694 --> 05:28.660
<i>just after 5:30 A.M.</i>

05:28.662 --> 05:30.629
<i>In what has to be
the worst crime</i>

05:30.631 --> 05:31.697
<i>in the national park's history.</i>

05:32.932 --> 05:33.965
I was here,

05:35.068 --> 05:37.803
and I received a phone call.

05:38.805 --> 05:41.940
It was our family doctor.

05:41.942 --> 05:44.609
<i>There was
an emergency contact thing</i>

05:44.611 --> 05:45.911
<i>in Thomas' wallet.</i>

05:45.911 --> 05:45.763
<i>It was the middle of the night.</i>

05:45.913 --> 05:48.580
<i>I didn't know why
I was getting a call.</i>

05:49.682 --> 05:53.652
I... I dropped to that floor.

05:53.654 --> 05:56.822
And I didn't think I was
ever going to get up again.

05:58.424 --> 06:00.525
First thing was...

06:01.994 --> 06:02.994
Was violence.

06:03.963 --> 06:05.097
Because, uh...

06:06.532 --> 06:07.666
<i>I heard that
someone shot him...</i>

06:09.035 --> 06:10.635
<i>In the back.</i>

06:10.637 --> 06:13.138
<i>And I... was angry.
I was very angry.</i>

06:14.507 --> 06:16.041
It took a while for

06:17.477 --> 06:18.477
grief to set in.

06:19.711 --> 06:19.712
I didn't believe it.

06:22.915 --> 06:24.015
I thought they'd made
a mistake,

06:24.017 --> 06:25.083
came to the wrong house,

06:26.386 --> 06:27.719
<i>had the wrong boy.</i>

06:27.719 --> 06:27.571
<i>I didn't believe it.</i>

06:27.721 --> 06:30.756
<i>I didn't believe it
till I actually saw his body.</i>

06:37.463 --> 06:40.165
<i>On that day I can remember
pretty much everything.</i>

06:40.167 --> 06:42.901
<i>I remember
the color of the sky,</i>

06:42.903 --> 06:44.636
<i>the calmness in the air.</i>

06:46.005 --> 06:48.407
I was just here at my post.

06:48.409 --> 06:50.442
This particular
ranger station, um,

06:50.977 --> 06:54.079
is the furthest south-west

06:54.081 --> 06:55.814
that you can get to by vehicle

06:55.816 --> 06:57.916
in yellowstone.

06:57.918 --> 07:00.819
<i>It was just after 5:30
in the morning.</i>

07:02.188 --> 07:04.089
<i>I'd just made myself
a cup of coffee.</i>

07:05.558 --> 07:06.992
<i>He walked out of the woods,</i>

07:08.628 --> 07:10.595
<i>the West Side,
the entrance side.</i>

07:11.497 --> 07:12.497
<i>He left the weapon</i>

07:13.099 --> 07:14.099
outside of the door,

07:14.101 --> 07:15.801
and just walked in.

07:18.103 --> 07:18.104
<i>The way it happened,</i>

07:18.105 --> 07:20.872
<i>you'd think there would
have been some emotion.</i>

07:23.075 --> 07:24.576
But like I said before,

07:24.578 --> 07:27.479
he seemed so calm and, uh...

07:28.781 --> 07:29.781
<i>So normal.</i>

07:32.552 --> 07:33.485
Right here.

07:36.088 --> 07:37.022
This way.

07:40.159 --> 07:42.160
It was right in here
that they parked the truck.

07:43.996 --> 07:45.697
This is where
the third victim was shot,

07:45.699 --> 07:47.132
by the back wheel.
- Okay.

07:48.601 --> 07:49.701
<i>It's a bit of a clearing here.</i>

07:52.872 --> 07:54.172
And this is where the fire pit

07:55.041 --> 07:56.741
was set up.

07:56.741 --> 07:56.593
Right around here.

07:56.743 --> 08:00.045
This is where the other two
victims were found.

08:00.047 --> 08:01.546
First victim was by the fire,

08:03.115 --> 08:04.249
and the second one,

08:04.251 --> 08:06.651
I don't know,
maybe ten feet from it.

08:06.653 --> 08:07.919
Never stood much of a chance.

08:18.631 --> 08:19.865
The families...

08:20.733 --> 08:21.900
Come and visit them.

08:22.935 --> 08:24.202
They bring flowers and stuff.

08:28.808 --> 08:31.042
<i>But he just wanted
to be outside, all the time.</i>

08:31.044 --> 08:33.144
I mean, he's the guy that
organized all those trips,

08:33.145 --> 08:34.746
every year.

08:34.748 --> 08:35.947
<i>Even when they weren't around,
he'd grab his knapsack</i>

08:35.948 --> 08:37.749
<i>and be gone.</i>

08:37.751 --> 08:38.984
<i>Go off hiking by himself.</i>

08:38.984 --> 08:38.836
<i>He just...</i>

08:38.986 --> 08:42.287
<i>I don't know what
it was about him.</i>

08:42.289 --> 08:44.188
<i>I guess he found
something in nature that...</i>

08:45.258 --> 08:46.791
<i>That put him at peace,
I don't know.</i>

08:46.793 --> 08:48.126
<i>But he loved it.</i>

08:49.295 --> 08:53.632
This is, uh,
Thomas and Alicia.

08:53.634 --> 08:54.966
Great looking couple.
- Yeah.

08:54.968 --> 08:57.235
And Thomas on his wedding day.

08:57.237 --> 08:58.670
That's a great shot.

08:58.672 --> 09:01.239
And another one of
Thomas and Alicia.

09:01.241 --> 09:03.542
This one over here,
this is, uh...

09:03.544 --> 09:05.210
This is all the boys together.

09:05.212 --> 09:06.745
Thomas, Cody and David.

09:08.214 --> 09:10.115
Oh, you know.
I'll show you this, actually.

09:11.617 --> 09:12.951
Here's...

09:15.655 --> 09:17.656
I took that on the morning
that they left.

09:19.258 --> 09:21.059
They did that trip every year.

09:21.061 --> 09:23.194
Well, David didn't actually
join them until

09:23.196 --> 09:24.195
the third year.

09:24.197 --> 09:25.730
But, uh...

09:25.732 --> 09:27.632
This was their...
This was their fifth year

09:28.134 --> 09:30.001
doing the trip.

09:30.003 --> 09:32.837
You know, they'd all come
over here in the morning,

09:32.839 --> 09:34.306
and they'd have breakfast,
and...

09:36.242 --> 09:37.909
And then they'd leave.

09:37.911 --> 09:39.911
Thomas, he was the one
with the pickup truck. So...

09:41.113 --> 09:42.080
And that's that.

09:51.857 --> 09:53.191
Sorry.

09:53.193 --> 09:54.359
It's all right.

09:57.863 --> 09:59.030
Okay.

09:59.032 --> 10:01.900
<i>I built a business
that I...</i>

10:02.868 --> 10:04.703
<i>Wanted to leave to him.</i>

10:04.705 --> 10:07.606
<i>You know, I respect what he
did and what he loved,</i>

10:07.608 --> 10:11.142
<i>but I thought at some point
he's gotta grow up and accept</i>

10:11.844 --> 10:13.812
<i>who he is and...</i>

10:15.181 --> 10:16.982
<i>You know?</i>

10:16.984 --> 10:18.283
At least make a life
for himself.

10:18.285 --> 10:19.351
Make a career for himself.

10:23.789 --> 10:26.358
Drive safe.
- Will do. Bye.

10:26.360 --> 10:28.393
Love you, mom.
- Bye.

10:28.395 --> 10:29.728
<i>He was going off to...</i>

10:30.763 --> 10:33.298
Yellowstone the umpteenth time,

10:33.300 --> 10:35.033
and it was just...

10:35.033 --> 10:34.885
He was on my last nerve
that day.

10:35.035 --> 10:38.970
<i>We'd had a little spat
at dinner the night before,</i>

10:38.972 --> 10:40.305
<i>and then he go... traipse off
to the...</i>

10:41.674 --> 10:43.808
<i>To the park,
and I just, you know...</i>

10:43.808 --> 10:43.660
<i>The last thing I said</i>

10:43.810 --> 10:47.779
was just, you know,
"good luck finding a career.

10:48.314 --> 10:50.181
In the woods."

10:50.183 --> 10:51.816
Or whatever I said. It just...

10:55.054 --> 10:56.655
<i>There are
only four people</i>

10:56.657 --> 10:58.189
<i>who truly know what
happened that night.</i>

11:00.426 --> 11:02.260
<i>Three of them are dead.</i>

11:02.262 --> 11:03.995
<i>The only eye witness account</i>

11:03.997 --> 11:05.830
<i>comes fro Dwayne Nelson,</i>

11:05.832 --> 11:07.198
<i>the man who pulled the trigger.</i>

11:08.734 --> 11:10.835
You know, once the suspect
is talking,

11:11.936 --> 11:11.937
they don't shut up.

11:11.938 --> 11:15.306
<i>It's like they need
to get it out.</i>

11:15.308 --> 11:16.708
<i>But let me tell you something.</i>

11:17.810 --> 11:19.144
<i>With Dwayne,</i>

11:19.146 --> 11:20.211
<i>he gave us everything.</i>

11:21.013 --> 11:22.981
It was almost like the...

11:22.983 --> 11:24.082
It was rehearsed.

15:20.953 --> 15:23.221
<i>I'm standing outside
the Cheyenne police station,</i>

15:23.223 --> 15:25.590
<i>where Dwayne Nelson will
soon be moved to the courthouse</i>

15:25.592 --> 15:27.292
<i>to attend a preliminary hearing</i>

15:27.294 --> 15:30.528
<i>in a case that is being dubbed
"the yellowstone murders."</i>

15:30.530 --> 15:32.196
<i>A bizarre triple homicide,</i>

15:32.196 --> 15:32.048
<i>where the murderer immediately</i>

15:32.198 --> 15:34.699
<i>turned himself in
and confessed.</i>

15:36.502 --> 15:38.269
I just really can't understand

15:38.271 --> 15:41.406
how a man could commit all these
horrific crimes, you know.

15:41.408 --> 15:44.609
And then just talk about it
like he's, uh...

15:44.611 --> 15:47.078
Reciting the details of
a traffic violation.

15:58.424 --> 16:01.159
<i>If you could say
something to Dwayne Nelson,</i>

16:02.561 --> 16:04.996
<i>and you had that opportunity,
what would you say to him?</i>

16:06.966 --> 16:08.333
<i>If I could
say anything</i>

16:08.701 --> 16:10.068
<i>to Dwayne,</i>

16:11.537 --> 16:13.604
I would say that i
want my son back.

16:15.641 --> 16:17.642
<i>I would say that
I want Cody back.</i>

16:18.277 --> 16:20.578
Out of the way.

16:20.580 --> 16:22.146
<i>He's never offered
me an apology.</i>

16:22.148 --> 16:25.583
<i>He's never taken any
responsibility for his actions.</i>

16:25.585 --> 16:26.651
<i>What will I have to say to him?</i>

16:27.519 --> 16:28.753
Nothing.

16:38.630 --> 16:40.198
We're live now.

16:40.200 --> 16:43.434
He will pay for the murders
of these boys.

16:44.636 --> 16:46.504
And he will understand
what it feels like

16:46.506 --> 16:48.339
to have something
taken away from you.

16:50.075 --> 16:51.509
<i>If I could even just...</i>

16:52.544 --> 16:54.178
Understand why

16:55.214 --> 16:57.415
this person did this,

16:58.283 --> 16:59.784
then I could maybe

16:59.786 --> 17:02.120
move better to forgiveness,
but...

17:02.122 --> 17:03.588
Because it's just so...

17:04.455 --> 17:07.290
Senseless and random.

17:09.361 --> 17:11.496
It shook my faith
for a very long time.

17:17.636 --> 17:19.436
<i>Cheyenne police
spent three months</i>

17:19.439 --> 17:20.570
<i>looking for a motive.</i>

17:21.406 --> 17:24.075
<i>They found none.</i>

17:24.077 --> 17:26.676
<i>With Dwayne's confession,
they were certain of a conviction.</i>

17:33.485 --> 17:35.553
<i>There were still questions
that needed answering.</i>

17:37.255 --> 17:37.256
<i>I canceled my flight home</i>

17:37.257 --> 17:40.324
<i>and headed to
Cheyenne, Wyoming,</i>

17:40.326 --> 17:42.260
<i>where the hearing
took place years ago.</i>

17:54.840 --> 17:57.075
<i>I think the only
regret I have is...</i>

17:58.243 --> 17:59.243
<i>Is maybe the, uh...</i>

18:01.380 --> 18:03.081
The over-confidence
that we were...

18:04.149 --> 18:06.617
That it was a done thing.

18:07.453 --> 18:08.486
A surefire

18:09.421 --> 18:10.621
win for us.

18:10.623 --> 18:11.622
But I, uh...

18:14.193 --> 18:16.194
I honestly didn't think
that it would go through.

18:18.297 --> 18:20.865
<i>I wouldn't call it arrogant,
but certainly,</i>

18:20.867 --> 18:23.101
<i>it seemed like
an easy case to me.</i>

18:23.103 --> 18:24.669
You wanna take
your feelings out of it,

18:24.671 --> 18:27.472
but we're talking about
a confessed murderer here.

18:27.474 --> 18:29.874
One who showed
no remorse, no regret.

18:29.876 --> 18:32.777
<i>We had murder weapon.</i>

18:32.779 --> 18:33.778
<i>We had fingerprints.</i>

18:34.645 --> 18:34.646
<i>Security footage,</i>

18:34.647 --> 18:38.282
<i>and a population
screaming for justice.</i>

18:38.284 --> 18:40.218
<i>And who wanted him
put away for life.</i>

18:40.220 --> 18:42.487
<i>And at that time, there was</i>

18:42.489 --> 18:45.189
<i>no doubt in my mind we were
gonna do just that.</i>

18:48.393 --> 18:51.129
<i>The fact that I got the
Nelson case was a surprise.</i>

18:51.131 --> 18:52.463
<i>My first, uh...</i>

18:53.232 --> 18:54.832
<i>Murder trial.</i>

18:54.834 --> 18:57.702
And I knew it was
gonna be a big deal.

18:58.637 --> 18:59.604
Uh...

19:00.572 --> 19:02.707
And it was a big deal.

19:03.842 --> 19:05.476
Dwayne's case was very unique.

19:06.211 --> 19:07.378
Okay?

19:09.381 --> 19:11.182
What you had here was

19:11.184 --> 19:12.416
a classic plea pardon case.

19:14.453 --> 19:16.921
There was no logic
to his motivation.

19:16.923 --> 19:17.855
Absolutely none.

19:19.591 --> 19:22.827
Which set it up
for an insanity plea.

19:22.829 --> 19:25.429
I wanted to change
the location of the trial.

19:26.365 --> 19:28.499
I wanted to, uh...

19:28.501 --> 19:29.800
Make sure that we had
an impartial jury.

19:29.802 --> 19:31.302
He wouldn't stand for it.

19:31.304 --> 19:33.337
The loophole was
brought up to me

19:33.339 --> 19:35.773
almost exactly 24 hours
before we went to the hearing.

19:39.478 --> 19:41.279
So we looked at it.
We looked at it,

19:41.281 --> 19:42.847
we danced around it,
it was a conversation.

19:43.916 --> 19:45.416
And, uh...

19:45.418 --> 19:47.285
And then we looked into
the legalities of it.

19:49.321 --> 19:50.421
Then we ran with it.

19:52.224 --> 19:53.858
<i>Will the defendant
please rise.</i>

19:54.860 --> 19:57.295
<i>Based on federal and
district law,</i>

19:57.297 --> 20:00.698
<i>the constitution and with no
legal precedent to draw from,</i>

20:00.700 --> 20:02.934
<i>I have no choice but to
side with the defense.</i>

20:02.936 --> 20:04.602
<i>Mr. Nelson, you are free to go.</i>

20:05.905 --> 20:09.407
<i>The murder trial
in Cheyenne this morning</i>

20:09.409 --> 20:11.776
<i>has taken yet another
unexpected turn.</i>

20:11.778 --> 20:13.578
<i>During today's
preliminary hearing,</i>

20:13.580 --> 20:15.313
<i>confessed murderer,
Dwayne Nelson,</i>

20:15.315 --> 20:17.848
<i>was acquitted of all charges</i>

20:17.850 --> 20:20.985
<i>due to what can only be described
as a flaw in the system.</i>

20:20.985 --> 20:20.837
<i>...an unusual case.</i>

20:20.987 --> 20:24.355
<i>And families are
understandably shocked</i>

20:24.355 --> 20:24.207
<i>with the judge's decision.</i>

20:24.357 --> 20:26.891
<i>Imagine a murderer
being allowed to</i>

20:26.893 --> 20:28.826
<i>walk the streets as a free man.</i>

20:28.828 --> 20:31.495
<i>That's exactly what took
place here today.</i>

20:35.000 --> 20:38.736
I remember there was
absolute confusion

20:38.738 --> 20:40.004
and shock.

20:40.006 --> 20:41.239
All hell broke loose.

20:41.640 --> 20:42.974
Right? It was...

20:43.775 --> 20:45.643
Insanity.

20:45.645 --> 20:48.446
We weren't prepared for that.
I wasn't prepared for that.

20:48.448 --> 20:50.314
This guy should have been
put away for life.

20:52.451 --> 20:54.418
<i>It was so far beyond logic.</i>

20:55.420 --> 20:56.988
<i>So far beyond reason.</i>

20:56.990 --> 20:58.723
<i>It was... it was...</i>

21:00.292 --> 21:01.525
<i>Beyond justice.</i>

21:04.029 --> 21:06.330
<i>And the worst part
was feeling the shift.</i>

21:08.333 --> 21:10.668
You know, 'cause it
was like Dwayne

21:10.670 --> 21:11.902
was no longer the bad guy.

21:13.038 --> 21:14.038
I was.

21:15.874 --> 21:19.043
<i>And it was
the assistants that came in</i>

21:19.045 --> 21:21.379
<i>and gave us the news initially.</i>

21:22.546 --> 21:22.547
<i>So they could be the recipients</i>

21:22.548 --> 21:27.285
<i>of all of our grief and all
of our anger at that moment.</i>

21:27.287 --> 21:29.520
And then the head team came in

21:29.522 --> 21:31.022
and explained to us
what had happened.

21:33.325 --> 21:35.426
<i>The loophole
in the law changed everything.</i>

21:36.295 --> 21:38.396
<i>And unless we could prove</i>

21:38.396 --> 21:38.248
<i>that the murders
were premeditated,</i>

21:38.398 --> 21:42.967
<i>or that a felony was committed
leading up to the murders,</i>

21:42.969 --> 21:45.469
<i>this crime could not
and cannot be tried.</i>

21:45.471 --> 21:46.537
<i>You need a motive.</i>

21:46.539 --> 21:48.806
We need motive
to move the trail,

21:48.808 --> 21:50.875
to get him out from under the
protection of that goddamn loophole.

21:52.611 --> 21:54.378
<i>We had
covered all the bases.</i>

21:54.380 --> 21:56.013
<i>We had looked for
any connection</i>

21:56.015 --> 21:58.316
<i>between Dwayne Nelson
and his murder victims.</i>

21:58.316 --> 21:58.168
<i>But there wasn't any.</i>

21:58.318 --> 22:00.584
<i>Dwayne was from north Dakota,</i>

22:00.586 --> 22:03.087
<i>and the boys were
from rapid city.</i>

22:04.589 --> 22:06.023
So, as Dwayne confessed,

22:06.025 --> 22:08.659
it was an isolated incident.
There was no motive.

22:10.429 --> 22:13.864
<i>We were all regular...</i>

22:13.866 --> 22:15.433
<i>People who didn't
even understand</i>

22:15.435 --> 22:16.834
<i>half of the system
to begin with.</i>

22:18.403 --> 22:21.839
<i>And once we began
with the whole</i>

22:23.075 --> 22:26.911
state line, federal,
the state...

22:26.913 --> 22:30.948
I think we just assumed
that they would work it out.

22:32.117 --> 22:35.586
I don't think anyone
really understood

22:35.588 --> 22:37.555
the ramifications of this.

22:37.557 --> 22:39.123
I think there was a feeling,

22:39.125 --> 22:41.025
certainly in me,

22:41.027 --> 22:43.094
and I know in a few
of the others, was that

22:43.096 --> 22:46.530
this was just maybe
the first step

22:46.532 --> 22:50.034
in crossing this huge hurdle,

22:50.036 --> 22:52.770
<i>and that we would
stick with it,</i>

22:52.770 --> 22:52.622
<i>and there would be appeals,</i>

22:52.772 --> 22:57.842
<i>and everyone would throw
their weight behind this.</i>

22:57.844 --> 23:00.678
<i>And as the weeks,
and eventually months, passed,</i>

23:00.680 --> 23:03.381
<i>and we realized,</i>

23:03.383 --> 23:07.051
<i>"no. No, this isn't...
This isn't changing.</i>

23:07.053 --> 23:10.554
This really is not changing
in our favor."

23:10.556 --> 23:13.591
There was an incredible
amount of anger.

23:13.593 --> 23:15.793
I don't feel guilty for
adhering to the constitution.

23:17.629 --> 23:19.163
I don't feel guilty

23:19.165 --> 23:20.965
doing what's right
according to the law.

23:22.100 --> 23:24.101
Right? I don't feel guilty

23:24.103 --> 23:26.437
for letting a man walk

23:26.439 --> 23:29.106
because the constitution
says that he should.

23:30.041 --> 23:31.041
I'm doing my job.

23:32.411 --> 23:34.178
The court did their job.

23:34.180 --> 23:35.880
We all did our job on this.

23:38.717 --> 23:40.184
He walks.
He's supposed to walk.

23:41.019 --> 23:42.186
Right?

23:45.724 --> 23:46.791
Simple.

23:51.563 --> 23:53.431
The fuck are we on?

23:53.433 --> 23:55.599
Left on the main street.

23:55.601 --> 23:59.203
<i>Daniel matcek was a local
yellowstone newspaper reporter.</i>

23:59.203 --> 23:59.055
<i>He covered the hearings</i>

23:59.205 --> 24:02.973
<i>and spent a lot of time
researching the murders.</i>

24:02.975 --> 24:04.942
<i>It's a small town,</i>

24:04.942 --> 24:04.794
<i>and I've lived here
my whole life.</i>

24:04.944 --> 24:08.446
<i>And nothing like this has
ever happened before.</i>

24:08.448 --> 24:11.982
<i>So I have a responsibility
to tell the story.</i>

24:11.984 --> 24:16.720
<i>I actually call my article
"the inconceivable truth".</i>

24:16.722 --> 24:19.123
It's so funny that it
became a constitutional debate.

24:19.925 --> 24:21.592
Three boys were shot

24:21.594 --> 24:22.993
and killed.

24:22.995 --> 24:24.829
In cold blood.

24:24.831 --> 24:26.797
This is not
a constitutional issue.

24:26.799 --> 24:28.566
It became
a constitutional issue

24:28.568 --> 24:31.569
because Dwayne made it
a constitutional issue.

24:31.571 --> 24:34.138
There's three dead boys,

24:34.140 --> 24:35.606
and no one went to jail for it.

24:36.508 --> 24:37.775
No one was punished for it.

24:38.209 --> 24:38.210
What did he do?

24:38.211 --> 24:42.246
Six months for illegal
possession of a firearm

24:42.248 --> 24:43.848
in a national park?

24:43.850 --> 24:44.949
It's a joke.

24:44.951 --> 24:46.517
That is a joke

24:46.519 --> 24:47.985
to those families.

24:47.987 --> 24:50.588
I am still angry.

24:51.823 --> 24:52.957
I'm still in shock.

24:54.259 --> 24:59.029
I still feel completely
betrayed by a system that

24:59.031 --> 25:01.732
not only did I think
that was on my side,

25:01.734 --> 25:04.134
but I was assured
it was on my side.

25:04.136 --> 25:05.836
Who came up
with the loophole defense?

25:07.105 --> 25:10.007
I don't recall.

25:10.009 --> 25:11.275
We started throwing around...

25:11.277 --> 25:13.777
It was an idea that...

25:13.779 --> 25:16.180
Looked more and more interesting
the more we looked at it.

25:16.182 --> 25:17.748
And we started to run with it.

25:17.750 --> 25:20.150
But you don't recall
who came up with the one...

25:20.152 --> 25:21.919
I don't recall.

25:21.921 --> 25:24.722
I find that impossible
to believe.

25:24.724 --> 25:26.123
You find that impossible to believe?
- Yeah.

25:26.658 --> 25:28.792
Look, uh...

25:28.794 --> 25:30.060
It was the basis of
your entire...

25:30.062 --> 25:31.262
I was told that you were
coming in here

25:31.264 --> 25:32.863
to talk to me

25:32.865 --> 25:34.598
about practicing law
in Cheyenne.

25:34.598 --> 25:34.450
Well, this is part of it.

25:34.600 --> 25:37.668
Not specific elements
about specific cases. Okay?

25:37.670 --> 25:39.136
You want that stuff?

25:39.138 --> 25:41.038
If you want it,
you can go down to the court,

25:41.040 --> 25:43.841
there are court records,
you can take a look at all that stuff.

25:43.843 --> 25:44.875
Okay? It's all there for you.

25:46.244 --> 25:47.611
Okay.
- All right? Are we good here?

25:47.613 --> 25:48.679
Can we just back up a little?

25:48.681 --> 25:50.114
'Cause I'm good.

25:50.116 --> 25:51.982
I'm good. All right?
Thank you very much.

25:51.984 --> 25:53.217
I appreciate you coming by,
i really do.

25:53.219 --> 25:54.318
Thank you. Thank you.

26:03.961 --> 26:03.962
<i>I went
to the courthouse,</i>

26:03.963 --> 26:07.631
<i>but was denied access
to the records.</i>

26:07.633 --> 26:09.667
<i>I was told the documents
had been sealed,</i>

26:09.669 --> 26:10.901
<i>but they couldn't tell me why.</i>

26:21.646 --> 26:23.781
<i>Investigating the loophole,
however,</i>

26:23.783 --> 26:24.715
<i>was much easier.</i>

26:28.887 --> 26:30.921
<i>The constitution is
the supreme law</i>

26:30.923 --> 26:33.057
<i>for every citizen living
in the United States.</i>

26:34.192 --> 26:36.126
<i>But the constitution
that protects us</i>

26:36.128 --> 26:38.128
<i>also let a murderer go free.</i>

26:40.732 --> 26:43.801
<i>Article three, section two
of the constitution...</i>

26:51.276 --> 26:53.043
<i>This, however, does not clarify</i>

26:53.045 --> 26:54.244
<i>where the jury
should come from.</i>

26:55.347 --> 26:57.381
<i>So the sixth amendment
was written,</i>

26:57.383 --> 26:59.083
<i>requiring that
the jury must be...</i>

27:06.324 --> 27:08.359
<i>So based on the constitution,</i>

27:08.361 --> 27:10.194
<i>any person charged with murder</i>

27:10.196 --> 27:12.730
<i>must be tried
before a local jury</i>

27:12.732 --> 27:15.132
<i>that comes from
the state and district</i>

27:15.134 --> 27:16.734
<i>in which the crime took place.</i>

27:18.770 --> 27:20.871
<i>Yellowstone national park,</i>

27:20.873 --> 27:23.374

<i>recognized as the first

27:26.412 --> 27:30.314
<i>It is predominantly situated in
the north-west corner of Wyoming.</i>

27:30.316 --> 27:33.183
<i>But approximately nine
percent of yellowstone</i>

27:33.185 --> 27:35.919
<i>overflows north into Montana,</i>

27:35.921 --> 27:38.122
<i>and west into Idaho.</i>

27:38.124 --> 27:40.290
<i>The strip of the park
located in Idaho</i>

27:40.292 --> 27:43.360
<i>is where the law and
civil rights collide.</i>

27:45.397 --> 27:48.098
<i>Yellowstone park is not
governed by state law.</i>

27:48.900 --> 27:50.334
<i>It is ruled under federal law.</i>

27:51.336 --> 27:53.771
<i>So any crime committed
in the park</i>

27:53.773 --> 27:56.273
<i>must be tried at the courthouse
in mammoth hot Springs.</i>

27:56.275 --> 27:59.043
<i>Or in Cheyenne at
the federal district court.</i>

27:59.978 --> 28:02.012
<i>So what does this all mean?</i>

28:02.014 --> 28:05.716
<i>The jurors must be drawn
from this small strip of land</i>

28:05.718 --> 28:07.818
<i>of approximately
50 square miles.</i>

28:09.320 --> 28:10.754
<i>There is only one problem.</i>

28:11.823 --> 28:13.157
<i>No one lives here.</i>

28:13.992 --> 28:15.959
<i>You cannot select a jury of 12</i>

28:15.961 --> 28:19.763
<i>from an area that has
a population of zero.</i>

28:33.044 --> 28:34.812
Hello, sir.

28:34.814 --> 28:36.447
Can I ask you a question?

28:36.449 --> 28:37.948
Sorry to interrupt you.

28:37.950 --> 28:39.016
I know you're in the middle
of your meal there.

28:39.018 --> 28:40.250
But, uh...

28:41.786 --> 28:43.087
You or anyone from your herd

28:43.089 --> 28:44.321
happen to have
been in the region

28:44.323 --> 28:45.756
where there's, uh,

28:45.758 --> 28:47.858
a supposed
constitutional loophole,

28:47.860 --> 28:48.892
near the Idaho side?

28:50.128 --> 28:51.462
No?

28:51.464 --> 28:53.063
Or any of your family
or associates?

28:54.299 --> 28:55.399
Nothing?

28:56.768 --> 28:58.235
Deutsch? Speak deutsch?

29:05.510 --> 29:07.010
It's just right up here.

29:18.923 --> 29:21.125
So if these maps are right,

29:21.127 --> 29:23.060
I think this is pretty much
the line here.

29:24.763 --> 29:26.864
So somewhere around here...

29:28.099 --> 29:30.467
Is the loophole in
the constitution.

29:31.302 --> 29:32.803
And somewhere around here

29:34.339 --> 29:36.006
is the no loophole
in the constitution.

29:37.275 --> 29:40.043
So the boundary is
kind of right there.

29:40.045 --> 29:42.012
Most people,
when they hear about it,

29:42.014 --> 29:44.448
they focus on the simple
matters of the case.

29:44.450 --> 29:45.382
They...

29:46.251 --> 29:48.452
Broad strokes.

29:48.454 --> 29:50.521
The murders, the hole
in the constitution.

29:50.523 --> 29:52.122
And understandably so.

29:52.124 --> 29:54.291
I mean, these are
the boldest parts of the case.

29:54.293 --> 29:56.827
But you can't,
and you really shouldn't

29:56.829 --> 29:59.296
miss the kind of

29:59.298 --> 30:01.064
mind boggling things

30:01.066 --> 30:03.433
that happened from the murders

30:03.435 --> 30:05.102
up until the court hearing.

30:05.104 --> 30:06.136
All right?

30:06.138 --> 30:07.871
Number one.

30:07.873 --> 30:10.440
Dwayne turns himself in
voluntarily almost immediately.

30:10.442 --> 30:12.442
Number two...

30:12.444 --> 30:14.912
He confesses,
within his rights,

30:14.914 --> 30:16.547
without representation
or legal counsel.

30:16.549 --> 30:17.881
Number three...

30:17.883 --> 30:19.082
He refuses

30:19.818 --> 30:20.884
to plead insanity.

30:20.886 --> 30:22.586
Number four, he refuses to move

30:23.822 --> 30:25.122
the trial.

30:25.124 --> 30:26.390
Now if you add all
those four things up,

30:26.392 --> 30:28.058
and he goes away
for a triple homicide,

30:28.060 --> 30:29.593
you can say, "fine."

30:29.595 --> 30:32.029
But he didn't.
He got away with it.

30:32.031 --> 30:34.097
And not because he
had a fair trial,

30:34.099 --> 30:38.068
or there was reasonable
doubt raised.

30:38.070 --> 30:39.837
But that there was
a hole in the constitution.

30:40.537 --> 30:40.538
An overlap.

30:44.008 --> 30:45.509
Now you consider those
four things again.

30:46.544 --> 30:48.078
Without them,

30:48.080 --> 30:50.881
he goes away for
a very, very long time.

30:52.049 --> 30:52.050
So you're suggesting that

30:52.051 --> 30:56.019
Dwayne knew exactly
what he was doing?

30:56.021 --> 30:58.322
That's exactly what
I'm suggesting.

30:58.324 --> 31:00.324
Of course, the only person that's
gonna know the answer to that

31:00.326 --> 31:01.992
is Dwayne.

31:01.994 --> 31:03.560
Why haven't there been further
investigations into this?

31:03.562 --> 31:05.462
Well, this whole thing was
swept under the rug.

31:06.497 --> 31:07.865
It's an embarrassment.

31:08.566 --> 31:10.634
A hole in the constitution!

31:12.637 --> 31:15.005
No, I think the right people
leaned in the right places

31:15.007 --> 31:16.340
to make sure that this
all went away

31:16.342 --> 31:18.108
before it became
a national uproar.

31:18.110 --> 31:20.377
So the government basically
helped a guilty man go free,

31:20.379 --> 31:21.478
is what you're saying?

31:21.480 --> 31:23.647
No. I'm saying
Dwayne helped himself.

31:25.016 --> 31:27.251
This cover up

31:27.253 --> 31:29.419
is just a happy consequence
for him.

31:31.589 --> 31:34.958
<i>When you dig
into Dwayne's past,</i>

31:34.960 --> 31:38.629
<i>you're gonna find a broken,
shattered man.</i>

31:38.631 --> 31:40.597
<i>I don't know.
I watched his interrogation,</i>

31:41.232 --> 31:43.133
<i>his confession.</i>

31:43.135 --> 31:44.401
<i>Was that a man on the edge,</i>

31:44.403 --> 31:46.069
<i>or a man in complete control?</i>

31:46.071 --> 31:50.941
<i>The only person who really
knows what happened that day</i>

31:51.476 --> 31:52.476
<i>is Dwayne.</i>

31:55.914 --> 31:58.215
<i>I decided to head
out to williston, north Dakota,</i>

31:58.217 --> 32:00.651
<i>to see what the people of
Dwayne's hometown had to say.</i>

32:04.355 --> 32:06.523
Have you heard of
the yellowstone murders

32:06.525 --> 32:07.491
and Dwayne Nelson?

32:07.493 --> 32:08.458
Yes.
- Yeah.

32:08.458 --> 32:08.310
You have.

32:08.460 --> 32:11.128
Can I just ask you a quick
question about them?

32:11.130 --> 32:12.429
Oh, no.
- No?

32:12.431 --> 32:13.964
We really don't wanna
answer any questions.

32:13.966 --> 32:15.365
Okay. Thanks very much anyway.

32:24.175 --> 32:25.275
No, I'm really not interested.

32:25.277 --> 32:27.277
No? Okay, well, thank you.

32:28.379 --> 32:30.480
Sorry, not right now.
I really must run.

32:30.482 --> 32:31.982
Okay. Thank you.
- Sorry.

32:37.689 --> 32:39.523
Ever heard of Dwayne Nelson
and the yellowstone murders?

32:39.525 --> 32:41.425
Uh, yeah. Sir, I don't
wanna talk about that.

32:41.427 --> 32:43.660
Can you just answer
just maybe on... no?

32:43.662 --> 32:44.661
Fuck!

32:48.433 --> 32:50.968
<i>People in town were
reluctant to speak at all.</i>

32:52.670 --> 32:54.705
<i>But those closest to Dwayne
before the murders</i>

32:54.707 --> 32:56.273
<i>welcomed us with open arms.</i>

33:11.055 --> 33:12.489
Hi, Rachel?
- Hi. Yeah.

33:12.491 --> 33:13.523
How are you? Julian.

33:13.525 --> 33:14.624
Julian? Hi.
- Yeah.

33:14.626 --> 33:15.592
This is Adam.

33:16.193 --> 33:16.194
Right.

33:18.696 --> 33:20.263
Come on in.
I'll take your coat.

33:20.265 --> 33:21.598
Okay. Thank you very much.

33:22.567 --> 33:24.167
So you knew Dwayne?

33:24.169 --> 33:25.135
Yeah.
- Yeah?

33:25.137 --> 33:26.436
Dwayne and Carol. Yeah.
- Okay.

33:26.438 --> 33:27.738
They were like family.
- Were they?

33:27.738 --> 33:27.590
Lovely couple.
- Okay.

33:27.740 --> 33:31.141
<i>After graduating
high school late,</i>

33:31.143 --> 33:32.609
<i>Dwayne married his sweetheart,</i>

33:32.611 --> 33:35.045
<i>Carol harson, at the age of 23.</i>

33:37.081 --> 33:38.515
<i>She met Dwayne...</i>

33:38.517 --> 33:41.151
Actually we were
in the car together.

33:41.153 --> 33:44.121
And we were going to, uh...

33:44.123 --> 33:46.323
To the bar and...

33:46.325 --> 33:48.625
It was winter
and the car got stuck.

33:48.627 --> 33:52.362
And, um...

33:52.364 --> 33:56.566
I was driving, and she was
out trying to push the car,

33:57.335 --> 33:59.136
and Dwayne came by

33:59.138 --> 34:01.772
and he was sort of like
a knight in shining armor.

34:01.774 --> 34:03.740
I wasn't too sure
about him at first.

34:03.742 --> 34:04.775
He, uh...

34:05.443 --> 34:07.277
He was really quiet.

34:07.279 --> 34:08.311
<i>Like really quiet.</i>

34:08.713 --> 34:10.813
<i>And smart.</i>

34:10.815 --> 34:12.449
<i>But he, uh...</i>

34:14.217 --> 34:16.553
He just was...

34:16.554 --> 34:19.156
He wasn't what I thought
Carol would go for.

34:23.460 --> 34:24.628
<i>He was a great family man.</i>

34:24.630 --> 34:26.563
<i>Him and Carol, they were...</i>

34:26.565 --> 34:28.598
<i>They were close, and...</i>

34:29.734 --> 34:31.400
You know, I...

34:31.402 --> 34:33.203
He's the kind of guy
that you'd wanna

34:33.205 --> 34:36.139
emulate, I guess,
is a good word to use.

34:36.141 --> 34:39.342
<i>You probably had it
growing up, too, that buddy,</i>

34:39.344 --> 34:41.478
<i>you know, that you could
just conversate with.</i>

34:41.779 --> 34:43.280
You know?

34:43.282 --> 34:45.148
There was no dead space
when you spoke with him.

34:46.384 --> 34:47.617
Oh, us going back.

34:49.219 --> 34:51.388
Bear took us into yellowstone
many times.

34:52.723 --> 34:54.091
I would...

34:54.092 --> 34:57.427
I would tag along when
my family didn't

34:58.329 --> 34:59.296
want me around,

34:59.797 --> 35:00.797
or whatever.

35:00.799 --> 35:02.332
And Dwayne...

35:02.867 --> 35:04.768
Dwayne and bear,

35:04.770 --> 35:06.603
they went in
pretty much all the time.

35:06.605 --> 35:08.171
Sorry, "bear"?

35:08.173 --> 35:09.873
<i>Bear, his dad.
He called bear.</i>

35:10.541 --> 35:11.675
<i>Um...</i>

35:12.543 --> 35:13.510
<i>Yeah.</i>

35:14.579 --> 35:16.179
Yeah. He was, uh...

35:18.784 --> 35:20.617
You know, sometimes you get...

35:20.619 --> 35:22.552
When the husband's watching TV,
you know,

35:22.554 --> 35:24.521
the wife's always complaining.

35:24.523 --> 35:27.891
"He's not with us enough.
He's not with us enough." Right?

35:27.893 --> 35:30.327
But you know, Carol,
she just...

35:31.662 --> 35:33.463
She let him be him,

35:34.132 --> 35:34.898
and he let her be her.

35:37.802 --> 35:39.503
<i>Five years
into their marriage,</i>

35:39.505 --> 35:42.172
<i>Carol gave birth to
their first child, Lily.</i>

35:42.174 --> 35:45.175
<i>However, when Lily was only
six-years-old,</i>

35:45.177 --> 35:47.210
<i>there was a deadly accident
in their home.</i>

35:49.547 --> 35:51.314
<i>A fire erupted
in their kitchen.</i>

35:51.316 --> 35:54.217
<i>Dwayne heard his child's
screams from outside,</i>

35:54.219 --> 35:56.253
<i>and ran to try to save her.</i>

35:56.255 --> 35:58.255
<i>But the fire had
raged too long.</i>

35:59.222 --> 35:59.223
<i>Lily was already dead,</i>

35:59.224 --> 36:04.928
<i>and Dwayne suffered third degree
burns on his hands and arms.</i>

36:04.930 --> 36:08.598
<i>It's devastating
when your child dies like that.</i>

36:08.600 --> 36:10.867
<i>I can't imagine myself,</i>

36:11.702 --> 36:12.669
<i>but for them...</i>

36:14.371 --> 36:14.372
It was horrible.

36:14.373 --> 36:18.275
I think Carol somehow dealt
with it better than Dwayne,

36:18.277 --> 36:19.543
in a way.

36:20.912 --> 36:21.945
The scars that he had,

36:23.281 --> 36:25.949
that was like his memory
of her.

36:26.951 --> 36:28.885
He just shut down.

36:29.854 --> 36:31.555
<i>It's remarkable,</i>

36:31.557 --> 36:33.857
I think that their
marriage survived that.

36:33.859 --> 36:37.294
Because lots of marriages don't,
you know.

36:37.296 --> 36:39.329
When you lose a child, it's...

36:39.331 --> 36:41.565
It's a terrible,
terrible thing.

36:45.436 --> 36:46.803
<i>He was ecstatic, you know,</i>

36:46.805 --> 36:48.538
when Carol became
pregnant again.

36:49.440 --> 36:51.208
<i>You know? But, um...</i>

36:51.976 --> 36:53.777
<i>He was, um...</i>

36:53.779 --> 36:57.214
<i>Absolutely terrified of
losing another child.</i>

37:02.320 --> 37:04.221
<i>If that was
gonna happen, you know,</i>

37:04.223 --> 37:06.356
<i>you'd want it
to happen to like,</i>

37:06.358 --> 37:07.724
<i>and evil person, you know.</i>

37:07.726 --> 37:08.892
<i>But I mean, he was...</i>

37:10.228 --> 37:11.695
He was one of the good guys.

37:13.531 --> 37:15.332
It's terrible.

37:15.334 --> 37:16.900
Then Carol was diagnosed
with cancer.

37:18.736 --> 37:20.971
<i>And she was four-and-a-half
months pregnant.</i>

37:23.808 --> 37:24.774
<i>So...</i>

37:26.010 --> 37:27.010
<i>She had to make a choice.</i>

37:31.315 --> 37:32.916
Take the chemotherapy and

37:34.318 --> 37:37.387
risk the health of
her baby, or...

37:39.756 --> 37:39.757
Well...

37:42.827 --> 37:45.495
When Carol died,
that was it for Dwayne.

37:48.399 --> 37:51.001
He still lived in town, but he
practically disappeared.

37:53.871 --> 37:55.839
Could you
tel me about how

37:55.841 --> 37:58.408
the death of Carol affected you

37:58.410 --> 37:59.643
on a personal level?

38:00.745 --> 38:01.978
She was my best friend.

38:03.447 --> 38:04.581
Um...

38:05.716 --> 38:06.816
And I still miss her.

38:08.619 --> 38:09.653
It was hard.

38:12.290 --> 38:13.423
Uh...

38:17.428 --> 38:18.728
It was hard.

38:18.730 --> 38:20.597
<i>The loss
is just so deep,</i>

38:22.066 --> 38:25.902
<i>that anything you say
is stupid.</i>

38:27.772 --> 38:30.473
You know?
It's gonna get better?

38:30.475 --> 38:32.042
You're gonna say that to him?
It's gonna get better?

38:32.042 --> 38:32.044
'Cause it's not gonna
get better.

38:35.680 --> 38:37.847
<i>I wasn't in touch
with him much,</i>

38:37.849 --> 38:39.816
<i>you know, at that time.</i>

38:39.818 --> 38:40.984
<i>But you know,
that's life, right?</i>

38:40.986 --> 38:42.852
I mean, people drift apart.

38:42.854 --> 38:43.987
That's what happens, man.

38:43.989 --> 38:46.790
Everybody leaves everybody
in the end.

38:47.591 --> 38:48.625
Right?

38:48.627 --> 38:51.428
Uh, the baby was...

38:53.931 --> 38:55.432
It was not...

38:55.866 --> 38:57.067
Quite right.

38:57.069 --> 38:58.935
It was premature.

38:58.937 --> 39:00.437
<i>And, uh...</i>

39:00.439 --> 39:04.341
<i>His little lungs
weren't formed properly.</i>

39:07.010 --> 39:07.011
<i>It's understandable that</i>

39:07.012 --> 39:11.514
<i>such a series of tragedies
would change a person.</i>

39:12.583 --> 39:13.583
For him, it...

39:14.819 --> 39:16.353
He had to find a reason

39:17.354 --> 39:17.355
why these things happened.

39:17.356 --> 39:20.757
It was inconceivable
that it could just...

39:22.660 --> 39:24.027
That that could just happen.

39:24.029 --> 39:25.795
I don't blame him
for thinking that.

39:27.131 --> 39:30.133
What I do blame him for
is what he did.

39:30.135 --> 39:31.935
What I blame him for
is the fact that he

39:33.137 --> 39:34.938
sought out a way

39:34.940 --> 39:37.907
to punish us all

39:38.876 --> 39:40.844
for what he thought
happened to him.

39:57.828 --> 40:00.630
<i>There was no way
of contacting Dwayne.</i>

40:00.632 --> 40:02.399
<i>Any numbers I managed to dig up</i>

40:02.401 --> 40:03.900
<i>rang without a machine.</i>

40:03.902 --> 40:06.436
<i>There were no
email addresses, nothing.</i>

40:07.971 --> 40:07.972
<i>Through further research,</i>

40:07.973 --> 40:12.008
<i>I found a po box
located in a small town,</i>

40:12.010 --> 40:14.144
<i>just outside
of windsor, Ontario.</i>

40:15.079 --> 40:16.846
<i>He was living in Canada now.</i>

40:18.749 --> 40:20.717
<i>The more research I did,</i>

40:20.719 --> 40:22.152
<i>the more questions were raised.</i>

40:36.801 --> 40:38.568
<i>After his wife passed,</i>

40:38.570 --> 40:41.604
<i>Dwayne spent a lot of time
at the local library.</i>

40:41.606 --> 40:43.973
<i>We were all
so broken up about it.</i>

40:44.708 --> 40:46.943
<i>After Carol passed,</i>

40:46.945 --> 40:49.813
<i>he never really recovered,
I think.</i>

40:51.215 --> 40:54.451
<i>I didn't wanna pry too much.</i>

40:54.453 --> 40:57.654
<i>And he wasn't the kind of person
who made you feel comfortable.</i>

40:59.190 --> 41:00.824
<i>He liked it here.</i>

41:02.493 --> 41:04.494
He didn't talk to anybody.
We just left him alone.

41:05.996 --> 41:07.697
Quiet. Quiet guy.

41:09.166 --> 41:10.834
<i>It's a small town,</i>

41:10.836 --> 41:13.102
we all go to church, and...

41:14.939 --> 41:18.475
I think when we found out that
Dwayne had done these things,

41:18.477 --> 41:22.011
there was a real feeling
of betrayal.

41:22.013 --> 41:25.181
How could somebody that
was part of our community

41:25.183 --> 41:26.516
have gone so wrong?

41:28.786 --> 41:31.855
I'll tell you. It was all anyone
talked about for a long time.

41:31.857 --> 41:34.657
But nobody really wants
to talk about it anymore.

41:37.495 --> 41:38.995
<i>They were three young boys,</i>

41:38.997 --> 41:40.830
<i>you know, and...</i>

41:41.699 --> 41:44.501
<i>I don't know, it's...</i>

41:44.503 --> 41:48.238
I've got a lot of mixed feelings
about the whole thing, obviously.

41:48.906 --> 41:50.006
Why would he...

41:50.574 --> 41:51.875
Do that?

41:51.877 --> 41:53.810
You know?
He knows what loss is.

41:53.812 --> 41:55.678
Right? He <i> knows</i> what loss is.

41:56.280 --> 41:58.214
He lost Carol, he lost Lily.

41:58.216 --> 42:02.886
You know, these boys,
they're someone's son.

42:02.888 --> 42:05.288
Right? He knows what it's like
to lose a child. He knows.

42:08.691 --> 42:08.692
<i>I was still confused</i>

42:08.693 --> 42:13.930
<i>as to why a seemingly good natured,
hard working family man</i>

42:13.932 --> 42:18.668
<i>would brutally murder David,
Cody and Thomas.</i>

42:19.870 --> 42:22.238
<i>Three young men,
who by all accounts,</i>

42:22.240 --> 42:23.907
<i>were innocent.</i>

42:26.277 --> 42:29.579
Cody, growing up, was lovely.

42:29.581 --> 42:34.183
He was smart and funny.

42:34.185 --> 42:37.654
Very, uh, very happy kid.
Very open kid.

42:38.956 --> 42:41.691
<i>And wonderful
with other children,</i>

42:41.693 --> 42:45.228
<i>whether they were younger, older,
or his own age. He was always...</i>

42:45.230 --> 42:47.230
<i>A very compassionate child.</i>

42:47.232 --> 42:49.632
Thomas met Cody at...

42:50.067 --> 42:51.668
They were doing...

42:51.670 --> 42:54.237
They were both going
for their bronze cross.

42:54.239 --> 42:56.039
<i>They were trying
to be lifeguards.</i>

42:56.041 --> 42:58.808
<i>And they were both
in the same...</i>

42:58.810 --> 43:01.644
<i>I think they were both in
the same instructor's class.</i>

43:01.646 --> 43:03.279
<i>And they hit it off.</i>

43:03.281 --> 43:07.350
<i>And the next thing I knew,
they were really good friends.</i>

43:07.352 --> 43:11.187
So do you remember how
David met Cody and Thomas?

43:15.359 --> 43:17.694
<i>David met
Cody and Thomas</i>

43:18.295 --> 43:19.729
in junior high.

43:20.931 --> 43:22.131
He was, um...

43:23.067 --> 43:24.968
<i>He was always very...</i>

43:24.970 --> 43:28.905
<i>Full of life and mischief
and jokes.</i>

43:28.907 --> 43:31.040
<i>He liked to pull
practical jokes on us</i>

43:31.042 --> 43:33.910
and things like that.

43:33.912 --> 43:36.346
<i>I caught them
trying to take the canoe.</i>

43:36.348 --> 43:38.014
<i>And they didn't know
how to use it,</i>

43:38.016 --> 43:39.182
<i>and they weren't wearing
life jackets.</i>

43:40.651 --> 43:42.218
I gave them a rather stern
talking to,

43:42.220 --> 43:44.087
and then immediately jumped
in the canoe myself

43:44.089 --> 43:45.855
to show 'em how to do it,

43:45.857 --> 43:47.624
and capsized the canoe.

43:47.626 --> 43:50.660
<i>That's probably the...</i>

43:50.662 --> 43:52.929
<i>That's probably the most
I've ever seen Cody laugh.</i>

44:11.949 --> 44:13.716
<i>The very nature
of a documentary</i>

44:13.718 --> 44:15.685
<i>is truth and reality.</i>

44:15.687 --> 44:17.320
<i>But what truth
are you presenting?</i>

44:17.322 --> 44:20.757
<i>A murderer's, a judge's,
your own?</i>

44:20.759 --> 44:22.191
<i>It's a perception of the truth.</i>

44:22.193 --> 44:23.660
<i>What was the real story?</i>

44:23.660 --> 44:23.512
<i>What really happened?</i>

44:23.662 --> 44:27.897
<i>There was no doubt that Dwayne's
story was heartbreaking.</i>

44:32.036 --> 44:34.437
<i>There was an unrelenting feeling
that something was missing.</i>

44:36.106 --> 44:38.341
<i>It wasn't that
everything didn't add up.</i>

44:38.343 --> 44:40.109
<i>It added up too perfectly.</i>

44:52.322 --> 44:55.725
Yeah, roll it, man.
It's fine. Yeah.

44:55.727 --> 44:57.894
Just come over here for a minute and watch this.
- Okay. What you got?

44:57.896 --> 44:59.162
I want you to see this, man.

45:00.430 --> 45:00.431
Look at this.

45:00.430 --> 45:00.282
<i>When did they
start going up there?</i>

45:00.432 --> 45:06.202
<i>I think Cody and Thomas
were going out there</i>

45:06.204 --> 45:08.371
<i>for a few years
before David joined them.</i>

45:10.107 --> 45:12.408
Did David spend much time
in yellowstone on his own?

45:12.410 --> 45:15.111
No, he didn't.
I mean, not to our knowledge.

45:15.113 --> 45:17.914
No, he wasn't the outdoors-man
that Cody was.

45:17.916 --> 45:20.450
In Dwayne's confession
he states that it was David

45:20.452 --> 45:22.351
<i>who suggested the site
that they moved to.</i>

45:24.455 --> 45:25.955
<i>I remember that, but...</i>

45:27.091 --> 45:28.157
<i>Like I told Patrick,</i>

45:28.159 --> 45:29.358
<i>that had to be a mistake.</i>

45:30.194 --> 45:31.894
Cody must have suggested it.

45:31.896 --> 45:33.329
I mean, our boy wouldn't have
known to go to that spot.

45:35.332 --> 45:36.399
See?

45:36.401 --> 45:38.234
Dwayne specifically said

45:38.236 --> 45:40.403
that it was David who
suggested that site.

45:40.405 --> 45:42.238
I mean, we've got the...

45:42.240 --> 45:44.006
you know, he could have
gotten the name wrong.

45:44.008 --> 45:45.808
Yeah, then he might not
have as well.

45:47.277 --> 45:50.079
I've got the confession
right here.

45:50.081 --> 45:53.816
A transcript of the exact
confession that Dwayne says,

45:53.818 --> 45:57.053
"i was gathering to leave when Dave
suggested something a little different.

45:59.088 --> 45:59.089
About an hour..."
And blah, blah, blah.

45:59.090 --> 46:03.926
"...that Dave stumbled across a large
area of these on previous trips."

46:05.329 --> 46:07.096
"Dave suggested
something a little different."

46:07.096 --> 46:06.948
That's what Dwayne said.
- Okay.

46:07.098 --> 46:10.800
And everything Dwayne says
is so precise

46:11.869 --> 46:13.402
and so specific.

46:13.404 --> 46:15.138
So, wait. You're thinking
there's a connection

46:15.140 --> 46:16.539
between Dwayne and Dave?

46:16.541 --> 46:18.207
A motive?

46:18.209 --> 46:19.408
I'm just thinking that

46:19.410 --> 46:22.211
everything so far
is so clean and so clear,

46:23.213 --> 46:24.781
and this is really
the only whisper

46:24.783 --> 46:26.082
of something that
doesn't compute.

46:31.054 --> 46:34.290
So what are we
doing at 6:27 A.M.?

46:34.292 --> 46:36.325
We got a call
from Theresa Fitzgerald.

46:37.194 --> 46:38.928
The librarian?

46:38.930 --> 46:40.263
The librarian.

46:41.932 --> 46:46.169
She received a visit last
night as she was closing up,

46:46.870 --> 46:48.004
from Dwayne Nelson.

46:50.507 --> 46:53.943
Theresa hasn't spoken
to anyone in years and years.

46:53.945 --> 46:55.278
And we go to visit her,

46:56.446 --> 46:59.148
and a few days later,
suddenly Dwayne shows up?

47:00.551 --> 47:01.918
You think he's following us?

47:03.053 --> 47:04.554
Well, obviously
he knows about us

47:04.556 --> 47:06.389
and he's worried
about something.

47:06.391 --> 47:08.024
He definitely worried
about something.

47:10.894 --> 47:12.895
I don't know if
there's that much to tell.

47:15.332 --> 47:17.934
So did you feel threatened
at all when he came in?

47:17.936 --> 47:19.001
Oh, no.

47:19.003 --> 47:20.269
No, he's very polite.

47:20.271 --> 47:22.338
It was just a shock.

47:22.340 --> 47:24.473
But he did ask you if you'd
been talking to anyone?

47:24.473 --> 47:24.325
Yeah, he did.

47:24.475 --> 47:28.444
And I told him
about the documentary,

47:28.446 --> 47:32.348
but after all, I only really talked
about Carol when you interviewed me.

47:34.117 --> 47:35.518
See, what's weird is that

47:35.520 --> 47:38.054
I've contacted everyone
we interviewed,

47:38.056 --> 47:40.857
and Dwayne hasn't tried to
get a hold of any of them.

47:40.859 --> 47:43.359
So I'm wondering
what I'm missing here.

47:45.195 --> 47:46.495
I don't know.

47:46.497 --> 47:48.531
I don't know if there's
anything more to tell.

47:48.533 --> 47:51.267
He came in in the morning,
left at night.

47:51.269 --> 47:52.535
I told him he could...

47:53.303 --> 47:55.571
Sign out anything he wanted,

47:55.573 --> 47:58.274
but he said he preferred
to be in the library.

47:58.276 --> 48:00.643
Was that to be closer to
his wife, do you think?

48:00.645 --> 48:03.546
Oh, I assumed so.
- Yeah?

48:03.548 --> 48:05.615
The only other people
spent that much time here

48:05.617 --> 48:07.884
are students doing research.

48:08.318 --> 48:09.318
Right.

48:12.189 --> 48:14.190
Did he ever take any of the
books home that he was reading?

48:14.458 --> 48:15.892
Uh, nope.

48:15.894 --> 48:17.260
Not that I can remember.

48:17.262 --> 48:18.928
And if you don't
check a book out,

48:18.930 --> 48:20.396
is there any record
of what you've been reading?

48:21.031 --> 48:22.665
No, of course not.

48:22.667 --> 48:24.367
Do you have any idea
what he was reading?

48:25.435 --> 48:27.603
Like I said, he just
sat in the back.

48:29.473 --> 48:30.640
Where was that again?

48:30.642 --> 48:31.941
Over in the corner there.

48:31.941 --> 48:31.943
Okay.

48:35.679 --> 48:37.914
<i>Why did Dwayne come back now?</i>

48:38.548 --> 48:40.082
<i>According to Theresa,</i>

48:40.082 --> 48:39.934
<i>he stopped visiting the library</i>

48:40.084 --> 48:43.252
<i>about a year before
he committed the murders,</i>

48:43.254 --> 48:45.187
<i>and had never been back since.</i>

48:46.089 --> 48:47.490
<i>So what was he doing here?</i>

48:49.293 --> 48:51.394
<i>The answer was staring
me in the face.</i>

48:52.162 --> 48:53.663
Adam...

48:55.699 --> 48:57.967
<i>Something so obvious,</i>

48:57.969 --> 48:59.368
<i>I'd missed it on
the first visit.</i>

49:03.706 --> 49:03.707
<i>Of course he was looking
at the law books, man.</i>

49:03.708 --> 49:07.944
What else are you gonna do in
your local library law section?

49:07.946 --> 49:09.712
You don't
go to the library,

49:09.714 --> 49:12.214
hoping to find an overlap
in the constitution.

49:12.216 --> 49:14.483
I mean, one that will allow
you to get way with murder?

49:14.485 --> 49:16.252
No, you don't.

49:16.254 --> 49:18.120
But he must have known about
this loophole beforehand.

49:19.256 --> 49:20.423
Otherwise, it's just
what he says.

49:20.425 --> 49:22.224
It's a bunch of, you know,
coincidences

49:22.226 --> 49:23.592
that let a guilty man go free.

49:23.594 --> 49:25.728
But, Julian, there are
a ton of cases

49:25.730 --> 49:28.564
where people have gotten off
on ridiculous technicalities.

49:28.566 --> 49:30.266
Yeah, but if we find a motive,

49:30.268 --> 49:32.635
then we can prove Dwayne
orchestrated the entire thing.

49:32.637 --> 49:34.370
Presuming there's
one to be found.

49:37.274 --> 49:39.108
It's like what
matcek said, man.

49:40.143 --> 49:42.345
It's not a guy who's crazy.

49:42.347 --> 49:43.713
He's in complete control.

49:45.015 --> 49:47.483
Patrick, sorry to
bother you again,

49:47.485 --> 49:50.386
but I just got back
from the williston library,

49:50.388 --> 49:53.389
and it seems Dwayne
was just there.

49:53.391 --> 49:56.325
I also found out that Dwayne
spent a lot of time there

49:56.327 --> 49:58.327
before the murders,
in the law section.

49:59.564 --> 50:01.497
I mean, he was looking
at law books.

50:01.499 --> 50:03.032
He was doing research there.

50:03.034 --> 50:05.167
Doesn't that indicate
some sort of premeditation,

50:05.169 --> 50:07.236
or a motive,
or something suspicious?

50:16.213 --> 50:17.380
Okay, but he
comes out of hiding,

50:17.382 --> 50:19.048
and he goes directly
back to the library?

50:19.050 --> 50:20.449
Isn't that also suspicious?

50:30.560 --> 50:32.061
Okay, no. Patrick, I get that.

50:32.063 --> 50:33.462
But can I just ask you
another question here?

50:38.035 --> 50:39.435
<i>There had to be a motive.</i>

50:39.437 --> 50:43.072
<i>There had to be a link between
Dwayne and one of the boys.</i>

50:43.074 --> 50:44.640
<i>I kept coming back
to David drabeck.</i>

50:45.674 --> 50:45.675
<i>According to Dwayne,</i>

50:45.676 --> 50:50.746
<i>he was the one that took them all
to the so called "zone of death".</i>

50:50.748 --> 50:52.782
<i>I hope David's mother
might have some answers.</i>

50:54.084 --> 50:55.718
Any connection maybe
through construction?

51:08.732 --> 51:11.133
One more quick question.

51:11.135 --> 51:14.804
Um, did David ever go to
north Dakota for any reason?

51:14.806 --> 51:16.572
Have any friends or family
up there?

51:30.620 --> 51:32.455
And who are we talking
about, Mrs. drabeck?

51:46.736 --> 51:47.837
What was her name?

51:52.742 --> 51:54.643
Mrs. drabeck, would you be able

51:54.645 --> 51:56.212
to send me that letter,
do you think?

51:57.481 --> 52:00.249
Earlier today, I got this
letter from Nancy drabeck.

52:01.151 --> 52:03.219
She sent me the letter

52:03.221 --> 52:05.121
that Kayleigh Brighton sent her

52:05.123 --> 52:06.322
now Kayleigh Brighton...

52:08.492 --> 52:11.160
Is not a photographer.
Kayleigh Brighton...

52:11.162 --> 52:13.329
Is an environmental biologist,

52:14.831 --> 52:18.501
at a university that happens
to be right above north Dakota.

52:18.503 --> 52:20.903
Come around here, man.
Check this out.

52:20.905 --> 52:23.439
I typed in Kayleigh's address
earlier today.

52:24.574 --> 52:28.344
And she lives right above
Regina, saskatchewan.

52:29.379 --> 52:31.747
The three boys are
from rapid city.

52:32.415 --> 52:34.483
Check out this route.

52:34.485 --> 52:36.318
Look at that.
Right in the middle.

52:36.320 --> 52:38.621
Williston, Dwayne's hometown,
right where we are.

52:41.324 --> 52:42.725
You're ready for
a road trip, buddy?

52:46.429 --> 52:48.564
What are you
hoping to find?

52:48.566 --> 52:51.667
There's a missing link
between Dave and Dwayne.

52:51.669 --> 52:53.569
And I know this girl's got
some answers for us.

52:53.571 --> 52:55.371
Do you realize how
ridiculous this sounds?

52:55.373 --> 52:57.206
This one girl?

52:57.208 --> 52:59.308
And what does this have to do
with Dwayne and Dave anyways?

52:59.310 --> 53:00.643
Well, you saw the map.

53:00.645 --> 53:02.511
And I've just got
a good feeling about it.

53:02.513 --> 53:03.779
What do you think
she'll tell you?

53:05.315 --> 53:06.782
I have no idea, man.

53:08.518 --> 53:10.486
But I have three hours and
26 minutes to figure it out.

53:11.755 --> 53:13.255
She knows something.

53:51.962 --> 53:53.629
I can't see anything in there.

53:54.664 --> 53:55.831
Whoa.

53:55.833 --> 53:57.299
It's a fucking pig, man.

53:58.802 --> 53:59.935
Look at this.

54:02.539 --> 54:05.407
Hey man, we're looking for Kayleigh Brighton,
actually.

54:07.911 --> 54:09.612
What's the camera for?

54:09.614 --> 54:12.348
Well, we're just hoping to talk
to Kayleigh here for a second.

54:12.350 --> 54:13.649
What do you wanna talk
to my wife for?

54:13.651 --> 54:15.317
Listen, man,
we drove a long way.

54:15.319 --> 54:17.519
I'm just wondering if i could
talk to Kayleigh for a second.

54:17.521 --> 54:18.721
Shut your camera off.

54:18.723 --> 54:20.923
Okay. But is she here?
Is she... she your wife?

54:20.925 --> 54:21.991
Shut your camera off.
- Hey, man.

54:21.993 --> 54:23.359
Listen. Hey, hey, buddy. Hey.

54:23.361 --> 54:24.560
It's up to her,
you understand?

54:24.562 --> 54:26.428
Okay, buddy.

54:26.430 --> 54:28.330
I don't want you going up there
shoving a camera in her face.

54:28.332 --> 54:30.399
Also, you know, when you go up there,
you make sure that camera's off.

54:32.302 --> 54:33.902
I'm sorry what
happened to the guys.

54:33.904 --> 54:35.771
But the thing is we don't
have the Internet here.

54:35.773 --> 54:39.275
We didn't. So I just heard
about it on the radio.

54:39.277 --> 54:40.676
That's how we heard about it.

54:40.678 --> 54:42.378
Right.
- But we...

54:42.380 --> 54:44.947
My parents let me know.
And it was a tragedy.

54:44.949 --> 54:47.650
Definitely devastating.

54:47.652 --> 54:50.686
I mean, I just can't believe
that happened.

54:50.688 --> 54:52.621
Yeah, it's a real shock
I'm sure, to hear that

54:52.623 --> 54:53.856
about a friend.
- Yeah.

54:53.858 --> 54:55.324
So, okay.

54:55.326 --> 54:56.959
You got me alone.

54:56.961 --> 54:58.827
I don't even know what you're
looking for though.

54:58.829 --> 55:00.629
I mean, to be honest,
i don't know what I'm looking for either.

55:00.631 --> 55:01.930
I'm just chasing every lead.

55:02.866 --> 55:05.334
But you have no idea

55:05.969 --> 55:07.536
about who Dwayne is, or...

55:07.538 --> 55:09.738
No, I have no idea. I'm sorry.

55:09.740 --> 55:11.473
With, um...

55:11.475 --> 55:14.043
With David, we worked
at camp together,

55:14.043 --> 55:13.895
we hung out with
the same friends.

55:14.045 --> 55:19.481
And I might have been
with him for 10 days total.

55:19.483 --> 55:21.750
And you guys never had a
relationship or anything like that?

55:21.752 --> 55:24.086
No, we were just friends,
that's it.

56:05.562 --> 56:07.029
All right, Julian,
let's get you miked up.

56:07.597 --> 56:08.664
Here you go.

56:11.501 --> 56:12.768
What are you doing with this?

56:12.770 --> 56:13.836
I watched this
a bunch of times.

56:13.838 --> 56:16.004
I know there's something...

56:16.006 --> 56:17.706
She's like...

56:17.708 --> 56:18.974
she's hiding something
for sure.

56:18.976 --> 56:20.376
Dude, you're reaching, man.

56:20.378 --> 56:21.744
Everything checks out.

56:24.548 --> 56:26.548
It's off, man. Something's
wrong with this.

56:26.550 --> 56:28.584
Come on, man. It's a dead end.
You know it is.

56:29.719 --> 56:31.387
Here, take this.
We got work to do.

56:35.759 --> 56:38.827
<i>Sometimes,
when you're searching for something so hard,</i>

56:38.829 --> 56:40.696
<i>you'll connect the dots
with wavy lines</i>

56:40.698 --> 56:42.998
<i>and convince yourself
they're straight.</i>

56:43.000 --> 56:44.933
<i>Sometimes they just don't
connect at all.</i>

56:50.140 --> 56:51.974
There's Patrick right there.

56:59.749 --> 57:01.483
How you doing?
- Okay, good. You?

57:01.485 --> 57:02.751
Listen...

57:02.753 --> 57:04.686
Could I see those case files
for a moment?

57:04.688 --> 57:06.121
I can't give you
those case files.

57:06.123 --> 57:07.923
I could look at them in your
office if you want, even.

57:07.925 --> 57:09.892
I'm sorry,
but they're private files.

57:09.894 --> 57:11.827
I know they're
private files, Patrick.

57:11.829 --> 57:13.729
But could I just look at them, maybe for a second?
- Sorry, I'm late.

57:13.729 --> 57:13.581
I know there's something
in there, man.

57:13.731 --> 57:17.666
Patrick, maybe I can schedule
something with your assistant?

57:18.669 --> 57:19.768
Patrick!

57:35.785 --> 57:39.521
<i>I had actually accomplished what
I had originally set out to do,</i>

57:39.523 --> 57:41.523
<i>which was to document
this bizarre murder case.</i>

57:43.526 --> 57:44.793
<i>My opinions had changed,</i>

57:44.795 --> 57:46.695
<i>but a theory is
just speculation.</i>

57:50.133 --> 57:51.900
<i>Without proof,</i>

57:51.902 --> 57:52.968
<i>without an interview,</i>

57:52.970 --> 57:54.970
<i>without any shred of motive,</i>

57:54.972 --> 57:57.739
<i>I was left staring
at the obvious.</i>

57:57.741 --> 57:59.741
<i>This was simply
a freak occurrence,</i>

57:59.743 --> 58:01.009
<i>nothing more.</i>

58:11.254 --> 58:12.688
Adam?

58:16.659 --> 58:18.126
Adam.
- What?

58:18.128 --> 58:19.728
Look at this.
We got a package, man.

58:19.730 --> 58:20.996
Wake up.
- What is it?

58:21.731 --> 58:22.931
Wake up. Come on.

58:22.933 --> 58:24.233
Come on, I'm trying to sleep.

58:24.767 --> 58:25.934
Take this.

58:25.936 --> 58:27.569
Adam, here. Come on.

58:27.571 --> 58:29.071
Take the camera. Let's go.

58:29.539 --> 58:30.739
Come on.

58:32.141 --> 58:33.742
You rolling.
- It's rolling.

58:42.785 --> 58:43.852
There's nothing in this.

58:43.854 --> 58:44.887
It's a joke?

58:59.903 --> 59:01.036
Do you have a phone on you?

59:01.771 --> 59:02.905
I do.

59:20.823 --> 59:22.124
There's two videos here.

59:29.999 --> 59:31.266
<i>Wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.</i>

59:34.704 --> 59:36.271
<i>I wanna get one
with all of you.</i>

59:37.774 --> 59:38.974
<i>All right. Come on, you guys.</i>

59:38.976 --> 59:40.242
<i>- Yeah?
- Yeah.</i>

59:40.244 --> 59:41.677
Oh.

59:41.679 --> 59:42.945
This is something.

59:42.945 --> 59:42.797
<i>- Good?
- Yeah, great.</i>

59:42.947 --> 59:46.081
<i>It's the annual yellowstone
boys' weekend.</i>

59:46.616 --> 59:47.983
<i>All right?</i>

59:50.253 --> 59:51.620
Wild.

59:53.356 --> 59:54.923
Who the fuck got this?

01:00:12.809 --> 01:00:13.875
Ooh!

01:00:26.356 --> 01:00:27.789
Holy shit.

01:00:34.864 --> 01:00:36.031
<i>No, no, no.</i>

01:00:36.033 --> 01:00:37.132
<i>No, no!</i>

01:00:38.135 --> 01:00:39.101
Holy fuck!

01:00:46.109 --> 01:00:48.076
Ad, who the fuck
dropped this off, man?

01:00:51.280 --> 01:00:52.314
Let's figure this out.

01:01:02.392 --> 01:01:05.260
Here. Right here.

01:01:05.262 --> 01:01:07.162
Let's go down to
the front desk...

01:01:17.106 --> 01:01:18.774
Hello, sir.
- Hi.

01:01:18.776 --> 01:01:20.308
How are you?
- I'm good.

01:01:20.310 --> 01:01:21.710
Can I ask a big favor of you?

01:01:22.445 --> 01:01:24.012
There.

01:01:24.014 --> 01:01:25.681
So this is this morning?
- Yeah.

01:01:25.683 --> 01:01:27.883
Okay. That's 5:15.

01:01:27.885 --> 01:01:30.018
Yeah, there he is.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:01:30.020 --> 01:01:31.753
He's gonna come out over there.

01:01:34.691 --> 01:01:35.891
See?

01:01:36.826 --> 01:01:37.959
And this is
my door here?

01:01:37.961 --> 01:01:39.094
Yeah.

01:01:39.096 --> 01:01:40.429
That's number 15.

01:01:46.302 --> 01:01:47.469
Who the fuck is that?

01:01:55.812 --> 01:01:57.279
You don't have any other...

01:01:57.281 --> 01:01:58.847
nothing where we can
see someone's face?

01:01:58.849 --> 01:02:01.249
You might catch his face
on the other...

01:02:03.019 --> 01:02:04.186
Who is that?

01:02:06.355 --> 01:02:07.823
Is it Dwayne?

01:02:19.335 --> 01:02:20.769
<i>All right. This good?</i>

01:02:20.769 --> 01:02:20.621
<i>Yeah, it's great.</i>

01:02:20.771 --> 01:02:24.306
<i>I watched the videos
for two days straight,</i>

01:02:24.308 --> 01:02:25.974
<i>and I didn't catch anything.</i>

01:02:27.376 --> 01:02:30.345
<i>But then, anything in life
can be fascinating</i>

01:02:30.347 --> 01:02:32.013
<i>when you delve
into the details.</i>

01:02:37.453 --> 01:02:39.187
The director,

01:02:40.189 --> 01:02:41.356
the crew.

01:02:43.493 --> 01:02:45.293
Kraft services...

01:02:48.865 --> 01:02:51.500
And beautiful America.

01:02:53.035 --> 01:02:54.536
Come here.

01:02:54.538 --> 01:02:56.204
Come here.
- What do you need?

01:02:56.206 --> 01:02:58.073
Set up the camera
over here and look at this.

01:02:58.075 --> 01:02:59.274
All right,
all right, hold on.

01:03:01.077 --> 01:03:02.377
Quit fucking around.
- I'm coming, dude.

01:03:02.379 --> 01:03:03.945
Put that down and look at this.
Check it out.

01:03:05.548 --> 01:03:06.982
You gotta see this.

01:03:06.984 --> 01:03:08.850
Yeah. All right.
What am I looking at?

01:03:08.852 --> 01:03:10.152
Just leave that alone for now...

01:03:10.152 --> 01:03:10.004
yes, yes.

01:03:10.154 --> 01:03:14.256
Look at this, look at this.
You gotta see this.

01:03:14.258 --> 01:03:16.792
What am I supposed to be looking at?
- What's that?

01:03:16.794 --> 01:03:18.260
See that logo right there?
- Yeah, on his jacket.

01:03:18.262 --> 01:03:19.494
Yeah, have you seen that before?
- No.

01:03:19.496 --> 01:03:20.896
You've seen that before.

01:03:20.898 --> 01:03:21.930
Okay.
- Look.

01:03:23.466 --> 01:03:25.333
At Dwayne's house,
which is right here...

01:03:25.335 --> 01:03:26.802
Look at this.

01:03:31.541 --> 01:03:34.142
What's that right there?
That's the same logo.

01:03:34.144 --> 01:03:35.343
Yeah, what's that?

01:03:35.345 --> 01:03:36.511
That's a water
filtration system

01:03:36.513 --> 01:03:38.280
that every house in
this area has.

01:03:38.282 --> 01:03:39.915
It's the same company, man.

01:03:39.917 --> 01:03:41.383
It's enrg. Look at this.
- Whoa, whoa.

01:03:41.385 --> 01:03:44.219
"Enrg."

01:03:44.420 --> 01:03:45.587
So?

01:03:45.589 --> 01:03:47.355
That's the same
company, man. Enrg.

01:03:47.357 --> 01:03:48.456
It's a fracking company.

01:03:50.860 --> 01:03:54.896
Jesus! That's Cody's dad, man.

01:03:54.898 --> 01:03:56.198
We might have just
found the motive.

01:04:02.305 --> 01:04:03.505
Raymond fucking Gibbs.

01:04:04.540 --> 01:04:05.574
Wait, wait, wait.

01:04:07.109 --> 01:04:09.344
The ceo of enrg, usa.

01:04:11.279 --> 01:04:11.280
We were looking at
the wrong guy the whole time.

<i>The city of williston has avoided
the current economic crisis</i>

01:04:16.486 --> 01:04:18.153
<i>due largely to the success</i>

01:04:18.155 --> 01:04:20.422

<i>Improvements in drilling

of hydraulic fracturing,</i>

01:04:25.295 --> 01:04:27.362
<i>otherwise known as "fracking."</i>

01:04:27.364 --> 01:04:30.332
<i>It's a controversial process,</i>

01:04:30.334 --> 01:04:32.534
<i>but it's used in abundance
in north Dakota,</i>

01:04:32.536 --> 01:04:35.303
<i>specifically in williston.</i>

01:04:35.305 --> 01:04:37.505
<i>Fracking is
a destructive process</i>

01:04:37.507 --> 01:04:40.008
<i>that is used

01:04:40.010 --> 01:04:42.043
<i>from rock that lies
deep underground.</i>

01:04:43.613 --> 01:04:45.280

<i>A mix of water,
sand and chemicals,</i>

<i>at a high enough pressure

01:04:54.458 --> 01:04:55.891
<i>and release the gas.</i>

01:04:57.059 --> 01:04:58.593
<i>Fracking is currently exempt</i>

01:05:03.433 --> 01:05:07.602
<i>Toxic spills and gas leaks

01:05:07.604 --> 01:05:10.105
<i>It's a process that destroys
our land</i>

01:05:10.107 --> 01:05:11.940
<i>and puts us all at risk.</i>

01:05:13.676 --> 01:05:15.944
<i>I recently filmed a documentary</i>

<i>In it, I examined this
very same issue</i>

01:05:20.284 --> 01:05:24.319
<i>in a small farming town

01:05:24.321 --> 01:05:27.155
<i>A single father's struggles

<i>have brought to his community.</i>

01:05:30.927 --> 01:05:32.427
<i>It's difficult. And yeah,</i>

01:05:32.429 --> 01:05:34.329
<i>sometimes it's
really discouraging</i>

01:05:34.331 --> 01:05:35.463
<i>and we think...</i>

01:05:37.033 --> 01:05:38.533
<i>Why bother anymore?</i>

01:05:44.040 --> 01:05:47.442
<i>And it's... I don't know.
I don't wanna be a coward.</i>

01:06:10.599 --> 01:06:13.034
<i>Dwayne Nelson's

<i>Was all this
just a coincidence?</i>

01:06:32.990 --> 01:06:36.057
<i>Or were these murders
an elaborate act</i>

Isn't there some kind of
law that's protecting him?

01:07:19.169 --> 01:07:20.769
Like a double jeopardy
or something like that?

01:07:26.308 --> 01:07:27.509
What's "empanelled" mean?

01:07:34.383 --> 01:07:36.151
But with a motive, then...

01:07:49.265 --> 01:07:50.331
holy shit. Okay.

01:07:55.271 --> 01:07:57.672
Yeah, unless he gave us
that footage out of guilt,

01:07:57.674 --> 01:07:59.174
and he wants to confess.

01:08:06.482 --> 01:08:08.216
Okay, thanks a lot,
Patrick, I appreciate it.

01:08:08.218 --> 01:08:09.451
Like hell.

01:08:09.453 --> 01:08:11.119
... What do you mean?

01:08:11.121 --> 01:08:13.521
Like hell we're gonna give
the footage to the authorities

01:08:13.523 --> 01:08:15.824
and let them handle...
- we're gonna give the footage to the authorities.

01:08:16.292 --> 01:08:17.392
"We" who?

01:08:17.394 --> 01:08:19.227
Us. You and I.

01:08:19.229 --> 01:08:20.662
We're gonna do
the Dwayne interview

01:08:20.663 --> 01:08:22.162
because we have
the opportunity to do it.

01:08:22.165 --> 01:08:23.631
If you do this, I'm walking.

01:08:23.633 --> 01:08:25.733
But we're here to do
the Dwayne interview.

01:08:25.734 --> 01:08:27.602
That's the whole point
of this story.

01:08:27.604 --> 01:08:29.404
Get the fuck out
of my way.

01:08:30.406 --> 01:08:31.872
Fuck off.

01:08:31.875 --> 01:08:34.509
Come on, soldier.
- Yeah, yeah. This is insane, dude.

01:08:34.511 --> 01:08:35.609
What do you mean
this is insane?

01:08:35.612 --> 01:08:36.810
This is what
we came here for, man.

01:08:36.813 --> 01:08:38.645
Do you realize
the guy is following us,

01:08:38.648 --> 01:08:40.448
and he's a murderer?

01:08:40.450 --> 01:08:42.216
We came here with a purpose.

01:08:42.219 --> 01:08:43.718
We are following a story.

01:08:43.720 --> 01:08:44.853
A purpose to stay alive.

01:08:44.854 --> 01:08:46.488
You heard Patrick, all right.

01:08:46.490 --> 01:08:47.856
If he admits to a motive,

01:08:47.858 --> 01:08:49.390
he's not protected anymore.

01:08:49.392 --> 01:08:51.359
So we're gonna walk away now
after all this time?

01:08:51.361 --> 01:08:52.527
Yeah, we're sitting ducks.

01:08:52.529 --> 01:08:53.694
We came all this fucking way.

01:08:53.697 --> 01:08:55.162
You know what? Fuck you.

01:08:55.764 --> 01:08:57.265
Stop being a pussy.

01:09:06.908 --> 01:09:09.810
<i>Things finally started
to makes sense.</i>

01:09:09.813 --> 01:09:12.279
<i>The more I thought about
all the events,</i>

01:09:12.282 --> 01:09:15.582
<i>the more I began to comprehend
how Dwayne got away with murder.</i>

01:09:18.720 --> 01:09:21.622
<i>There was the connection
to Raymond Gibbs and his son.</i>

01:09:21.625 --> 01:09:23.925
<i>But Dwayne killed three boys.</i>

01:09:23.926 --> 01:09:25.660
<i>That was the scary part.</i>

01:09:25.662 --> 01:09:27.694
<i>Ingeniously scary.</i>

01:09:27.697 --> 01:09:29.296
<i>If he killed Cody alone,</i>

01:09:29.299 --> 01:09:32.233
<i>it's far easier to draw
the lines together.</i>

01:09:32.234 --> 01:09:34.169
<i>So he diluted the motive.</i>

01:09:34.171 --> 01:09:37.171
<i>Kill Cody, you have murder
and motive.</i>

01:09:37.174 --> 01:09:40.707
<i>Kill them all, it's a random
act of violent insanity.</i>

01:09:48.651 --> 01:09:50.685
<i>Adam did have a point.</i>

01:09:50.687 --> 01:09:52.921
<i>I decided to take a copy
of the footage</i>

01:09:52.923 --> 01:09:55.757
<i>and a letter to the cops,
in case anything happened.</i>

01:10:02.198 --> 01:10:03.932
<i>When I started
this documentary,</i>

01:10:03.934 --> 01:10:06.834
<i>it was a passion project
based on a crazy story.</i>

01:10:06.836 --> 01:10:09.470
<i>It's not a story,
it's a tragedy.</i>

01:10:09.472 --> 01:10:11.706
<i>But I never thought
it would lead to this.</i>

01:10:11.708 --> 01:10:13.975
<i>I never though I would
fear for my life.</i>

01:10:15.277 --> 01:10:16.978
That's it, right there.

01:10:28.891 --> 01:10:30.758
When I get there,
shut that down.

01:10:31.694 --> 01:10:33.695
He was very,
very adamant about...

01:10:36.298 --> 01:10:38.666
The fact that he'll tell us
where to set up and what to do.

01:10:41.470 --> 01:10:42.470
You all right?

01:10:42.472 --> 01:10:43.638
I'm fine.

01:10:44.406 --> 01:10:46.274
Okay.

01:10:46.276 --> 01:10:47.408
I know you don't wanna be here.

01:10:47.410 --> 01:10:48.543
Dude, I'm fine.

01:10:53.816 --> 01:10:55.650
Jesus! Where the fuck
does this man live?

01:11:03.659 --> 01:11:05.260
All right. Shut it off.

01:11:06.328 --> 01:11:07.495
Let's do this.

01:11:12.868 --> 01:11:14.302
Where's your camera guy?

01:11:14.304 --> 01:11:15.403
It's just me and you.

01:11:19.508 --> 01:11:20.675
Okay.

01:11:23.545 --> 01:11:24.879
This isn't an interview, is it?

01:11:29.652 --> 01:11:31.286
No, it's not.

01:11:32.755 --> 01:11:33.921
Where is your son?
- Oh...

01:11:39.828 --> 01:11:41.796
Just leave my son out of this.

01:11:44.366 --> 01:11:45.700
Okay, you've got
something to say,

01:11:45.702 --> 01:11:47.035
so why don't you just say it?

01:11:47.037 --> 01:11:48.469
You don't need me here.

01:11:49.972 --> 01:11:51.072
It's not true. I do need you.

01:11:51.807 --> 01:11:53.608
Why?

01:11:53.610 --> 01:11:55.643
I think that if you
see something

01:11:57.313 --> 01:11:58.980
that is completely
wrong and unjust,

01:12:00.816 --> 01:12:03.451
you have a philosophical

01:12:03.453 --> 01:12:05.453
moral obligation
to speak up against it,

01:12:05.455 --> 01:12:06.721
even if you cannot change it.

01:12:10.025 --> 01:12:11.826
You've seen my film.

01:12:15.397 --> 01:12:16.464
Yeah.

01:12:18.667 --> 01:12:19.901
I've seen
a lot of things, Julian.

01:12:21.704 --> 01:12:22.870
And nothing's changed.

01:12:22.872 --> 01:12:24.072
But an eye for an eye?

01:12:25.007 --> 01:12:26.341
Is that really your answer?

01:12:26.942 --> 01:12:28.409
Are you even now with Raymond?

01:12:28.411 --> 01:12:29.677
Oh...

01:12:30.813 --> 01:12:32.847
If...

01:12:32.849 --> 01:12:35.516
If a child is ripped away
from you like that...

01:12:38.053 --> 01:12:39.787
There's no replacing it.

01:12:41.557 --> 01:12:42.824
There's no eye for an eye.

01:12:45.894 --> 01:12:47.795
But you are a murderer now.

01:12:48.897 --> 01:12:50.064
I didn't ask to be
a part of it.

01:12:53.769 --> 01:12:54.902
But as I man,

01:12:58.607 --> 01:13:01.042
as a husband and as a father,
you do what's necessary.

01:13:08.717 --> 01:13:10.618
You found it necessary

01:13:10.620 --> 01:13:12.787
to kill three innocent boys?

01:13:14.990 --> 01:13:16.858
These people get away
with murder every day.

01:13:19.661 --> 01:13:21.162
Hell, you made documentaries
about it.

01:13:24.066 --> 01:13:25.833
But you're
just sitting there...

01:13:25.835 --> 01:13:27.168
You're sitting there
and you're judging me,

01:13:27.170 --> 01:13:28.469
just like everyone else.

01:13:29.171 --> 01:13:30.605
Those people, they...

01:13:32.141 --> 01:13:33.608
They manipulate the laws.

01:13:36.578 --> 01:13:38.413
And you can speak up,
you can...

01:13:39.014 --> 01:13:39.947
You can protest.

01:13:42.184 --> 01:13:43.184
It doesn't matter.

01:13:46.555 --> 01:13:48.656
I'm just the first guy
to play their...

01:13:48.658 --> 01:13:49.757
Their game by their rules.

01:13:51.493 --> 01:13:53.027
Are you saying
that you planned

01:13:53.029 --> 01:13:55.596
and carried out the murder
of Raymond Gibbs' son?

01:13:55.598 --> 01:13:57.098
Julian, I'm saying

01:13:57.100 --> 01:13:59.200
Raymond Gibbs hasn't
suffered enough.

01:14:02.204 --> 01:14:03.538
It still doesn't hide the fact

01:14:03.540 --> 01:14:04.939
that you killed Thomas Burnett

01:14:05.808 --> 01:14:07.041
and David drabeck.

01:14:08.143 --> 01:14:09.510
Do you think I'm a monster?

01:14:09.978 --> 01:14:11.679
You murdered three boys.

01:14:12.781 --> 01:14:13.815
And you filmed it.

01:14:18.854 --> 01:14:20.521
Yeah, I watch that film
every day.

01:14:26.195 --> 01:14:27.628
I watch that film every day.

01:14:29.798 --> 01:14:32.133
Because if I didn't,

01:14:33.202 --> 01:14:35.136
I would not have
the strength to...

01:14:46.248 --> 01:14:48.015
Okay, Dwayne, we'll take
a break if you want.

01:14:49.151 --> 01:14:50.585
Dwayne!

01:14:50.587 --> 01:14:51.786
Dwayne! Jesus!

01:14:51.788 --> 01:14:53.654
... Fuck!

01:14:53.656 --> 01:14:56.491
Dwayne! Oh, shit! Adam!

01:14:56.792 --> 01:14:57.925
Dwayne?

01:14:58.760 --> 01:14:59.861
Dwayne?

01:14:59.863 --> 01:15:01.095
Holy shit.

01:15:02.030 --> 01:15:03.231
Oh!

01:15:06.134 --> 01:15:07.535
Holy shit, dude.

01:15:07.537 --> 01:15:08.870
Call an ambulance.
- Are you okay?

01:15:08.872 --> 01:15:09.937
Call an ambulance.

01:15:09.939 --> 01:15:11.072
I am, I am.

01:15:11.074 --> 01:15:12.673
What the fuck.
His kid's in the back.

01:15:13.942 --> 01:15:15.142
What did you do, man?

01:15:25.020 --> 01:15:26.120
<i>...camera guy?</i>

01:15:26.122 --> 01:15:27.255
<i>It's just you and me.</i>

01:15:30.792 --> 01:15:31.926
<i>That's good.</i>

01:15:33.028 --> 01:15:34.729
<i>This isn't an interview, is it?</i>

01:15:36.598 --> 01:15:38.299
<i>No, it's not.</i>

01:15:38.299 --> 01:15:38.151
<i>Are you saying that...</i>

01:15:38.299 --> 01:15:38.301
<i>I wanted something good
to come from this.</i>

01:15:42.638 --> 01:15:44.805
<i>I thought that I would
find it in the truth.</i>

01:15:44.807 --> 01:15:47.542
<i>Raymond Gibbs
hasn't suffered enough.</i>

01:15:47.544 --> 01:15:50.044
<i>Some people congratulated
me on getting to Dwayne.</i>

01:15:50.046 --> 01:15:51.846
<i>Cornering him into the truth.</i>

01:15:52.981 --> 01:15:54.181
Jesus! Fuck!

01:15:55.216 --> 01:15:55.217
<i>Dwayne! Holy shit! Adam!</i>

01:15:55.218 --> 01:15:58.286
<i>But there's more to it
than that.</i>

01:15:58.288 --> 01:15:59.654
<i>Dwayne?</i>

01:16:00.289 --> 01:16:01.589
<i>Dwayne?</i>

01:16:01.591 --> 01:16:02.857
<i>Holy shit.</i>

01:16:03.624 --> 01:16:03.625
<i>Oh!</i>

01:16:07.796 --> 01:16:10.197
<i>Holy shit, dude!
Are you okay?</i>

01:16:10.199 --> 01:16:11.132
<i>Call an ambulance.</i>

01:16:11.132 --> 01:16:10.984
<i>I am, I am.</i>

01:16:11.134 --> 01:16:13.935
<i>What the fuck.
His kid's in the back.</i>

01:16:16.004 --> 01:16:19.974
<i>Dwayne's son
had died two months earlier.</i>

01:16:19.976 --> 01:16:22.843
<i>About the same time I had
received the anonymous email</i>

01:16:22.845 --> 01:16:24.612
<i>about the yellowstone murders.</i>

01:16:25.814 --> 01:16:27.114
<i>Losing his son</i>

01:16:27.116 --> 01:16:28.316
<i>was the final straw.</i>

01:16:28.318 --> 01:16:31.752
<i>Dwayne was clinging
to his son's life</i>

01:16:31.754 --> 01:16:33.321
<i>more than he was
clinging to his own.</i>

01:16:38.727 --> 01:16:40.661
<i>When I returned home,
I had another email</i>

01:16:40.663 --> 01:16:42.096
<i>from chasingbison bear.</i>

01:16:42.931 --> 01:16:45.266
<i>No subject, no message.</i>

01:16:47.269 --> 01:16:48.936
<i>That image was always
a metaphor for me.</i>

01:16:49.838 --> 01:16:52.039
<i>The chase through yellowstone.</i>

01:16:52.041 --> 01:16:54.675
<i>But I never fully understood
if I was the bear,</i>

01:16:54.677 --> 01:16:56.310
<i>or if I was the bison.</i>

01:16:56.312 --> 01:16:58.112
<i>The hunter or the hunted.</i>

01:16:59.648 --> 01:17:01.682
<i>Now I realize I was neither.</i>

01:17:01.684 --> 01:17:02.950
<i>I was just the guy
with the camera,</i>

01:17:02.952 --> 01:17:04.018
<i>who captured the story.</i>

01:17:08.290 --> 01:17:11.325
<i>...or whatever.
And Dwayne...</i>

01:17:11.325 --> 01:17:11.177
<i>Dwayne and bear,</i>

01:17:11.327 --> 01:17:14.829
<i>they went in
pretty much all the time.</i>

01:17:15.964 --> 01:17:17.031
<i>Sorry, "bear"?</i>

01:17:17.033 --> 01:17:19.734
<i>Bear, yeah. Barry was his dad.</i>

01:17:20.035 --> 01:17:21.769
<i>Yeah.</i>

01:17:21.771 --> 01:17:23.371
Dad's just a...

01:17:24.673 --> 01:17:25.973
<i>Barry was his dad.</i>

01:17:26.340 --> 01:17:26.341
<i>Yeah.</i>

01:17:26.342 --> 01:17:30.044
<i>Unlike me, Dwayne actually
looked up to his father.</i>

01:17:31.178 --> 01:17:31.179
<i>I should have
paid more attention</i>

01:17:31.180 --> 01:17:34.248
<i>to the email address
from the beginning.</i>

01:17:35.751 --> 01:17:39.020
<i>Two names appear under
the handle "bison Barry".</i>

01:17:39.022 --> 01:17:43.257
<i>One, a sports director from a
university radio station in Cleveland,</i>

01:17:43.259 --> 01:17:47.194
<i>the other a part time writer for
the west yellowstone newspaper</i>

01:17:47.196 --> 01:17:48.963
<i>back in the '70s.</i>

01:17:48.965 --> 01:17:51.866
<i>His full name,
Barry Robert Nelson.</i>

01:17:51.868 --> 01:17:54.101
<i>Father to Dwayne Nelson.</i>

01:17:54.103 --> 01:17:57.438
<i>What caught my eye most
was one article in particular,</i>

01:17:57.440 --> 01:17:59.306
<i>written back in 1978.</i>

01:18:00.075 --> 01:18:02.743
<i>"Idaho - population zero."</i>

01:18:04.246 --> 01:18:06.747
<i>...as the yellowstone murderer
was found dead in his home</i>

01:18:06.747 --> 01:18:06.599
<i>early this morning.</i>

01:18:06.749 --> 01:18:10.685
<i>Police have yet to reveal the full
details surrounding his death,</i>

01:18:10.687 --> 01:18:12.887
<i>but early reports
suggests suicide.</i>

01:18:12.889 --> 01:18:14.321
<i>The whole time,
I believed that Dwayne</i>

01:18:14.323 --> 01:18:16.057
<i>wanted to admit the truth.</i>

01:18:16.059 --> 01:18:18.926
<i>But as way to cleanse his soul.</i>

01:18:18.928 --> 01:18:21.729
<i>Now I know that this was
all part of his plan.</i>

01:18:21.731 --> 01:18:23.998
<i>Everything from the get go
had been on his terms.</i>

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:25.232
<i>Everything.</i>

01:18:25.234 --> 01:18:27.034
<i>The murders, the loophole.</i>

01:18:27.036 --> 01:18:28.202
<i>Even this film.</i>

01:18:29.204 --> 01:18:31.005
<i>He wanted revenge, he got it.</i>

01:18:31.007 --> 01:18:33.741
<i>He wanted the truth out there,
he got that, too.</i>

01:18:33.743 --> 01:18:36.444
<i>He used me,
he used the justice system,</i>

01:18:36.446 --> 01:18:37.812
<i>he used us all.</i>

01:18:44.219 --> 01:18:47.321
<i>I struggled a lot with whether
I should release this film,</i>

01:18:47.323 --> 01:18:49.990
<i>and whose story
I was trying to tell.</i>

01:18:49.992 --> 01:18:51.859
<i>I wanted something good
to come from this.</i>

01:18:53.128 --> 01:18:54.929
<i>I thought that I would find it
in the truth.</i>

01:18:55.964 --> 01:18:57.264
<i>The truth was worse.</i>

01:18:58.900 --> 01:19:01.902
<i>One man picked a fight with
a multi-million dollar company,</i>

01:19:01.904 --> 01:19:04.805
<i>whose fracking process
was poisoning his home</i>

01:19:04.807 --> 01:19:06.073
<i>and killing his family.</i>

01:19:07.008 --> 01:19:08.976
<i>But nobody won here.</i>

01:19:08.978 --> 01:19:11.212
<i>Not at the expense
of a man's life,</i>

01:19:11.214 --> 01:19:14.448
<i>his family's,
and three young men.</i>

01:19:14.450 --> 01:19:17.218
<i>I think there's a lot more to it
than even Dwayne's letting on.</i>

01:19:18.019 --> 01:19:20.254
<i>You know, maybe something that</i>

01:19:20.256 --> 01:19:21.789
<i>can shed a better light.</i>

01:19:24.992 --> 01:19:24.993
<i>That's Dwayne.</i>

01:19:24.994 --> 01:19:29.230
<i>He's just gonna bottle it up
and tell you what you need.</i>

01:19:31.133 --> 01:19:32.199
<i>Bye bye.</i>

01:19:32.201 --> 01:19:33.367
<i>Okay.</i>

01:19:33.369 --> 01:19:35.236
<i>- Muah!
- Muah!</i>

01:19:35.238 --> 01:19:36.804
<i>I love you, dada.</i>

01:19:36.806 --> 01:19:38.472
<i>Love you, dada.</i>

01:19:38.474 --> 01:19:39.840
<i>Oh, so sweet.</i>

01:19:41.943 --> 01:19:43.978
<i>The fact that he
could kill those three boys</i>

01:19:43.980 --> 01:19:45.412
<i>seems unreal to me.</i>

01:19:46.381 --> 01:19:48.215
<i>But...</i>

01:19:48.217 --> 01:19:51.152
<i>You know, you put a man
through what he went through,</i>

01:19:51.154 --> 01:19:53.320
<i>I guess everybody would
have a breaking point, so...</i>

01:20:06.301 --> 01:20:08.102
<i>Yellowstone national park.</i>

01:20:09.271 --> 01:20:11.572
<i>Around every corner
is a reminder</i>

01:20:11.574 --> 01:20:13.507
<i>of how still life can be.</i>

01:20:14.543 --> 01:20:16.343
<i>How vast it can be.</i>

01:20:19.080 --> 01:20:20.848
<i>How true it can be.</i>

01:20:22.284 --> 01:20:23.884
<i>Until it isn't.</i>
