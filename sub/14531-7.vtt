00:41.205 --> 00:42.873
Onomatopoeia.

00:42.957 --> 00:46.752
O-N-O-M-A-T-P-E-I-A.

00:46.836 --> 00:48.545
- Onomatopoeia.
- [bell dings]

00:48.629 --> 00:50.881
- [man] That is incorrect.
- I knew she'd blow it.

00:50.965 --> 00:53.258
There's a secret "O" in there!

00:53.342 --> 00:55.970
- [door opens]
- [man] The word is "troglodyte."

00:56.053 --> 00:58.514
Hey, what are you doing back?
I thought you had a big date.

00:58.597 --> 01:03.352
It was a complete disaster. I couldn't
even make it through the appetizers.

01:03.435 --> 01:05.062
What was wrong with this one?

01:05.146 --> 01:08.024
Well, you know, when
you go on these things,

01:08.107 --> 01:11.735
usually you start off with a
cute anecdote about yourself.

01:11.819 --> 01:16.448
I use the one about nursing
a baby bird back to health.

01:16.532 --> 01:18.450
That was me! I did that!

01:18.534 --> 01:21.745
Well, I took it. It's a big hit, actually,

01:21.829 --> 01:24.207
should you want to start dating.

01:24.289 --> 01:29.419
Anyway, this guy's anecdote
was about his fatty lipoma.

01:29.503 --> 01:33.257
- I don't know what that is.
- Oh, I didn't either. It's a tumor.

01:33.340 --> 01:36.177
He named it Farley. I think it had teeth.

01:36.260 --> 01:38.721
Well, I'm gonna turn your
night around right now.

01:38.804 --> 01:41.598
Round one of the spelling bee is on.

01:41.682 --> 01:43.517
Although if you're a big fan of Devon Zima,

01:43.600 --> 01:45.477
he just crapped out on a diphthong.

01:45.561 --> 01:50.149
As amazing as that sounds, I would
rather have dinner with Farley.

01:50.233 --> 01:53.402
Round one is when they tell the
back stories about all the kids.

01:53.485 --> 01:56.113
Don't you want to hear about
the obstacles they've overcome?

01:56.197 --> 01:58.866
What obstacles? They're twelve.

01:58.949 --> 02:00.701
Besides, I have another
date tomorrow night.

02:00.784 --> 02:02.953
I don't want to get too invested.

02:03.037 --> 02:06.999
A third date this week.
Aren't you exhausted?

02:07.083 --> 02:09.043
I'm a woman on a mission.

02:09.126 --> 02:13.422
But this year is different! They
have a Twitter ticker and a hashtag!

02:13.505 --> 02:16.341
- Do you know what that means?
- Yes.

02:16.425 --> 02:18.302
Could you explain it to me?

02:18.385 --> 02:20.096
Did I miss anything?

02:20.179 --> 02:23.473
- [man] The word is "ennui."
- I was just about to say the same thing.

02:23.557 --> 02:25.142
Come on. You love sports.

02:25.226 --> 02:27.270
I love that you consider this "sports."

02:27.352 --> 02:30.022
- It's on ESPN!
- Six.

02:30.106 --> 02:33.525
- E-N... N... -
Aren't you nervous?

02:33.609 --> 02:35.861
I'm on the edge of my seat!

02:35.945 --> 02:39.282
What happens if they miss a
word? Lions? Electric shock?

02:39.364 --> 02:41.992
- [man] That is correct.
- They have to sit down.

02:42.076 --> 02:44.703
- Sometimes they faint.
- [chuckles]

02:44.787 --> 02:48.791
It's an annual tradition.
Frankie and I never missed it.

02:48.874 --> 02:51.794
Well, I guess I can handle one round.

02:51.877 --> 02:55.172
Well... times three.

02:56.299 --> 03:00.510
- It's three days.
- In a row? Dear God.

03:00.594 --> 03:04.389
It's okay. You don't
have to watch it with me.

03:04.473 --> 03:06.767
Well, I am sorry, love. But you know,

03:06.850 --> 03:10.354
I'm smack in the middle of Antietam,
and I'm so anxious to know how it ends.

03:10.437 --> 03:13.607
- I'll be in my office.
- [man] The word is "subpoena."

03:13.690 --> 03:16.235
- [boy] Can you use it in a sentence?
- "Subpoena"...

03:16.319 --> 03:18.403
to be avoided at all costs.

03:18.487 --> 03:21.824
He's going to blow it. There's
a surprise "B" in there.

03:21.907 --> 03:25.911
S... A... P...

03:36.380 --> 03:37.965
I got it.

03:38.048 --> 03:40.092
All right...

03:40.759 --> 03:44.305
- [Nwabudike] Brianna? I got your text.
- Bud, help!

03:44.388 --> 03:48.184
- Oh, what did you do to that brisket?
- I did everything you told me to do.

03:48.267 --> 03:51.061
I took it out of the oven and
then I sliced it, and now... this.

03:51.145 --> 03:52.771
I told you, you have to let it rest.

03:52.855 --> 03:54.982
Well, but, why does it
get to rest and I don't?

03:55.065 --> 03:56.984
Well, okay. Now you're having a stew.

03:57.067 --> 03:59.528
No. Bud, stew isn't date food.

03:59.611 --> 04:02.323
It is now. What time
will Racist Dave be here?

04:02.406 --> 04:05.701
Okay. First of all, Border Patrol Dave.

04:05.784 --> 04:07.452
And he's coming in an hour.

04:07.536 --> 04:10.664
You know what? I'm impressed you're
actually cooking for this guy.

04:10.747 --> 04:12.541
Not brisket, anybody could make that,

04:12.624 --> 04:14.251
- but you don't even cook for yourself.
- [cell phone chimes]

04:14.335 --> 04:18.755
Well, it's the second date.
You know what that means...

04:18.839 --> 04:20.589
It's the second time
you're sleeping with him?

04:20.673 --> 04:22.926
Wow.

04:23.010 --> 04:25.054
He just canceled.

04:27.431 --> 04:29.183
Racist prick.

04:29.266 --> 04:31.352
- You okay?
- Yes.

04:32.436 --> 04:34.897
- You wanna talk?
- No.

04:34.980 --> 04:38.150
I am so tired of this. It's just too hard.

04:38.234 --> 04:41.570
It is hard. Doesn't help
that you're terrible at it.

04:41.653 --> 04:43.613
No, Bud, I am.

04:43.697 --> 04:45.824
No, come on, I'm joking.

04:47.576 --> 04:49.412
I just don't even know what I want anymore.

04:49.494 --> 04:51.747
You want what everyone wants.

04:51.830 --> 04:54.083
You want to come home at the end of the day

04:54.166 --> 04:55.918
to someone who's happy to see you.

04:56.001 --> 04:57.669
You're right.

04:59.588 --> 05:01.340
I'm getting a dog.

05:03.884 --> 05:06.178
- Mmmm...
- Yeah.

05:10.391 --> 05:14.270
Oh, you know, I cannot figure
out how to boot this thing on.

05:14.353 --> 05:16.521
You got a computer.

05:16.605 --> 05:18.690
You don't even like the smoke detector.

05:18.774 --> 05:21.944
- I just don't think it should talk!
- What possessed you to get that?

05:22.027 --> 05:24.905
I want to be "a part of the conversation."

05:24.988 --> 05:26.573
What does that even mean?

05:26.656 --> 05:28.909
It's like the announcer
guy said last night.

05:28.992 --> 05:31.870
You don't just watch,
you Twitter, you hashtag,

05:31.954 --> 05:33.830
you Instant Gram.

05:33.914 --> 05:38.335
Why watch alone when I can
share the entire experience

05:38.419 --> 05:41.464
- with millions of strangers?
- [laughs]

05:42.672 --> 05:45.675
- Can you help me?
- Sure.

05:45.759 --> 05:47.886
It's easy.

05:47.970 --> 05:52.349
You just... plug it in.

05:52.433 --> 05:54.601
- And then...
- [computer hums]

05:54.684 --> 05:58.981
Oh, boy! Can you do it
again so I can watch you?

05:59.064 --> 06:01.066
Carefully, step by step.

06:01.150 --> 06:03.110
- Turn it on again?
- Yes!

06:03.193 --> 06:05.070
Do it so I can learn to do it.

06:05.154 --> 06:06.655
You know, "you teach a man to fish."

06:08.073 --> 06:09.199
What does it want now?

06:09.283 --> 06:11.576
It's asking you to put in
your name and a password.

06:11.660 --> 06:13.996
- What should I put?
- Your name. And a password.

06:14.079 --> 06:15.539
Okay.

06:18.917 --> 06:20.752
Now, what about "NWABUDIKE?"

06:20.836 --> 06:23.547
No, no. No, you don't want
to use personal information.

06:23.630 --> 06:25.090
Use something random.

06:26.633 --> 06:29.761
No. Something you can remember.

06:29.845 --> 06:33.182
You know, some inside joke.

06:33.265 --> 06:35.434
Okay.

06:35.518 --> 06:39.938
- [Frankie] "7BONGS". [laughs]
- [Grace] And put it there.

06:40.939 --> 06:42.358
- Okay.
- Now what do I do?

06:42.441 --> 06:44.401
- Click "okay."
- Where do I click?

06:44.485 --> 06:46.445
On the touchpad.

06:46.529 --> 06:48.531
[groaning]

06:48.613 --> 06:53.327
The touchpad! Here! Gosh almighty.

06:53.410 --> 06:55.745
I just don't know why they make it so hard!

06:55.829 --> 06:58.123
They don't. Here is
what you're going to do.

06:58.207 --> 07:00.543
Oh, here, look.

07:00.625 --> 07:03.587
Call this number.

07:03.670 --> 07:06.298
- What is it?
- Professional help.

07:12.471 --> 07:14.348
Yeah, that's what I need.

07:14.431 --> 07:19.311
- [phone playing pop music]
- [sighs]

07:23.482 --> 07:25.025
- [woman's voice] Hello.
- Hello?!

07:25.108 --> 07:27.944
- Your estimated wait time is...
- Oh, for the love of fuck.

07:28.028 --> 07:30.573
- Less than one minute.
- Oh, great, great.

07:30.655 --> 07:32.741
- Sorry for swearing.
- [music continues]

07:32.824 --> 07:34.701
[woman] Tech Support.
How can we help you today?

07:34.784 --> 07:38.288
Hello. I have a computer
about which I know nothing.

07:38.372 --> 07:41.458
- I just want to get it online.
- Ok, sure.

07:41.542 --> 07:44.002
- Do you have a wireless connection?
- No. I-I'm not sure.

07:44.086 --> 07:46.338
Maybe. I-I don't... maybe.

07:46.422 --> 07:48.840
- What about your IP address?
- No. You're not listening.

07:48.924 --> 07:51.885
When I said "I know nothing,"
I meant "I know nothing."

07:53.178 --> 07:56.181
- [whispers] I'm 70 years old.
- Ohhh.

07:56.265 --> 07:59.435
Okay. We have someone for
you, ma'am. Hold on, please.

07:59.518 --> 08:01.061
No, no, wait, no...

08:01.144 --> 08:03.688
[music continues]

08:03.772 --> 08:06.609
- [man] Hello there.
- Hello.

08:06.691 --> 08:08.860
Hi. Good afternoon.

08:08.944 --> 08:12.239
So who do I have the pleasure
of speaking with right now?

08:12.322 --> 08:16.201
- This is Frankie.
- Hi, Frankie. I'm Mike.

08:16.285 --> 08:18.161
- Hi, Mike.
- Hi.

08:18.245 --> 08:22.040
I hear that you have a brand
new computer. That's awesome.

08:22.124 --> 08:23.750
Congratulations!

08:23.833 --> 08:26.920
Thank you, Mike. I'm not
thrilled about it just yet.

08:27.003 --> 08:28.088
[Mike chuckles]

08:28.171 --> 08:32.884
I do not blame you. Unfamiliar
technology can be really frustrating.

08:32.967 --> 08:36.388
Oh, you're telling me, I mean. It can.

08:36.472 --> 08:41.934
All right, all right, listen. I am
here for you. Now first things first.

08:42.018 --> 08:44.647
Just sit back, relax.

08:44.729 --> 08:46.189
Ah, mmm.

08:46.273 --> 08:48.692
Are you comfy? You in a good place to sit?

08:48.775 --> 08:51.403
- I think I am, Mike.
- Great!

08:52.404 --> 08:54.990
But from the sound of it, you've
got a great support system.

08:55.073 --> 08:59.953
You've got Coyote, and Bud,
you've got your work, Al-Anon...

09:00.036 --> 09:01.497
And now you.

09:01.580 --> 09:06.793
[chuckles] Thanks. So what do you say?
You ready to send your first Tweet?

09:06.876 --> 09:08.712
Yes, I am, Mike.

09:08.795 --> 09:11.590
And you're sure you want
to make it that profane?

09:11.674 --> 09:13.925
Abso-fucking-lutely.

09:14.009 --> 09:15.177
[both laugh]

09:15.260 --> 09:19.431
Okay. Bring the cursor
up to the blue button

09:19.515 --> 09:24.311
and three, two, one, click it.

09:24.394 --> 09:27.606
Did you get it? Did you get it?!

09:27.690 --> 09:29.733
- [laughing]
- Yeah! The whole world did.

09:29.816 --> 09:33.696
- You're part of social media now, baby.
- Oh, Mike, you're the best.

09:33.778 --> 09:38.575
No, no, no, no, you are, @suckitaynrand.

09:38.659 --> 09:40.910
- That's me!
- [knock on door]

09:40.994 --> 09:42.746
Oh, God, my ex-husband is here.

09:42.829 --> 09:45.832
Sol's there? Okay, you better go.

09:45.915 --> 09:48.335
- Knock, knock.
- I'll check up on you later.

09:48.418 --> 09:49.878
Okay, bye, Mike.

09:51.087 --> 09:53.006
What are you doing here, Sol?

09:53.089 --> 09:55.509
I've been meaning to bring
you some stuff from the house.

09:55.592 --> 09:58.303
- Figured you might need it.
- The bread machine?

09:58.387 --> 10:00.263
Who doesn't like fresh bread?

10:00.347 --> 10:02.766
Cider House Rules laser disc.

10:02.849 --> 10:05.352
What the hell are you doing here, Sol?

10:05.435 --> 10:08.647
Honestly, I was really
missing you last night.

10:08.731 --> 10:11.066
It was weird watching the show without you.

10:11.149 --> 10:12.275
Did you see Josiah?

10:12.359 --> 10:15.028
Did I see him go to town
scratching his testicles?

10:15.111 --> 10:17.822
- Unfortunate nervous tic.
- [laughs]

10:17.906 --> 10:20.158
Why don't you come over
tonight and watch it with me?

10:20.242 --> 10:21.493
Okay.

10:21.577 --> 10:23.995
- No, wait!
- Why not?

10:24.079 --> 10:26.456
Feels wrong. Alarm bells.

10:26.540 --> 10:29.125
Come on, just because
we don't live together,

10:29.209 --> 10:31.961
does that have to mean
the end of all our rituals?

10:32.045 --> 10:36.800
The spelling bee, volunteering
for the PBS telethon,

10:36.883 --> 10:38.343
the jicama harvest...

10:38.427 --> 10:42.305
The jicama harvest. I forgot about that.

10:42.389 --> 10:44.182
Do we really have to give that stuff up?

10:44.266 --> 10:46.101
- Yes, I think we do.
- Why?

10:46.184 --> 10:47.977
Because you're marrying someone else.

10:48.061 --> 10:51.856
Come on. It's not like I'm
asking you to go to Paris with me.

10:51.940 --> 10:56.069
We'll sit on the couch and watch
our favorite TV event of the year.

10:56.152 --> 10:59.698
Okay, you and me and Robert on the couch.

10:59.782 --> 11:01.074
That sounds cozy.

11:01.157 --> 11:05.370
No, Robert's going out with his friends
specifically so he won't have to watch it.

11:05.454 --> 11:08.331
I'm sure he'll be happy I'm
foisting it on somebody else.

11:09.666 --> 11:12.252
I'm gonna have to be strong
and say no for both of us.

11:12.335 --> 11:15.464
Okay. Understood.

11:15.547 --> 11:18.801
Let me know if you change your mind.

11:18.883 --> 11:21.720
My schedule is completely... "pultaceous."

11:21.804 --> 11:25.724
Pultaceous...
P-U-L-T-A-C...

11:25.808 --> 11:28.727
E? O-U-S?

11:28.811 --> 11:31.354
- You just beat Eileen!
- Yay!

11:31.438 --> 11:34.608
Pultaceous! Sit on it, home-schooling!

11:34.691 --> 11:38.528
- [Sol] Ha-ha!
- [laughs]

11:38.612 --> 11:40.238
[doorbell rings]

11:42.658 --> 11:47.496
Hi. Brianna? I'm Dutch. From SD Dog Rescue.

11:47.579 --> 11:49.748
I'm the "foster dad."

11:49.832 --> 11:53.168
- Yes! Sorry! Come in.
- Thank you.

11:53.251 --> 11:54.961
Hey, buddy.

11:55.044 --> 11:58.632
Oh, it's not going to be easy
saying goodbye to this guy.

11:58.715 --> 12:02.177
I'd love to keep him, truly,
but I already have five.

12:02.260 --> 12:05.681
Yeah, well, six dogs would
be pretty fucking crazy.

12:05.764 --> 12:09.559
Yeah. Wow. Yeah, you just...
you come right out and say it.

12:09.643 --> 12:11.186
I sure do.

12:12.937 --> 12:14.939
- So, you ready to meet him?
- Yes.

12:15.023 --> 12:17.984
Whip it out. Him out. The dog.

12:19.068 --> 12:21.864
- Whip him out. The dog.
- Whip the dog out.

12:21.946 --> 12:25.450
All right. All right, Leo.

12:29.412 --> 12:31.122
Umm...

12:31.206 --> 12:34.334
- Is this the dog from the website?
- Yeah.

12:37.504 --> 12:41.132
He's ugly... er than the profile pic I saw.

12:41.216 --> 12:44.845
Oh, this is your dog.

12:45.888 --> 12:49.098
Um, this is the food. It's
the food that he's been on,

12:49.182 --> 12:51.601
so if you want to change
it, you should do it slowly.

12:51.685 --> 12:54.521
Here's his leash, and a little chew toy...

12:54.604 --> 12:56.690
[Brianna] No, that's all
great. It's just, he seems...

12:56.773 --> 12:59.150
He just seems a little aloof.

12:59.943 --> 13:03.822
[laughs] Well, um, we should
probably just give him a minute.

13:03.906 --> 13:07.492
Because he's nervous. He probably
just wants to get to know you a little.

13:07.576 --> 13:10.746
Okay. It's just, he's already moving
in. He brought his own furniture.

13:10.829 --> 13:11.914
Yeah, not all of it.

13:11.996 --> 13:15.041
Actually, he has like a full patio
set and a grill back at the shelter.

13:15.124 --> 13:17.669
He left it for the other dogs to play with.

13:17.753 --> 13:20.589
What? He did?

13:20.672 --> 13:22.549
- Oh, oh.
- No, no.

13:22.632 --> 13:24.593
No, that was just a joke. Sorry about that.

13:24.676 --> 13:25.886
No, I don't get dog stuff.

13:25.969 --> 13:28.304
That's okay. You probably shouldn't
let your dog touch a grill.

13:28.388 --> 13:29.806
- But, like...
- Okay, okay.

13:29.890 --> 13:34.269
Anyway, I should probably take off
because I've gotta, I gotta run.

13:34.352 --> 13:35.854
- Oh, really?
- Anyway, Brianna.

13:35.938 --> 13:38.314
- It was very nice to meet you.
- You, too.

13:39.691 --> 13:41.234
Call me if you have any problems.

13:41.317 --> 13:43.236
- Okay.
- I'm sure you won't have any.

13:43.319 --> 13:44.780
All right. Bye, Leo!

13:46.364 --> 13:49.325
All right, bye.

13:49.409 --> 13:52.120
So... okay.

14:00.462 --> 14:04.007
Come here, boy. Come here, boy.

14:04.090 --> 14:06.259
Okay, I'll come to you.

14:07.385 --> 14:11.055
Hello. How are you? I am Brianna.

14:11.139 --> 14:15.018
You know, he really felt
that I had these anger issues

14:15.101 --> 14:19.314
and that I was just really
not communicating very well,

14:19.397 --> 14:22.651
which I didn't agree with,
but... that's how that ended.

14:24.110 --> 14:26.989
And nothing from you still.

14:27.071 --> 14:30.951
Your foster dad is a very sexy man.

14:31.034 --> 14:32.911
That was a surprise.

14:32.995 --> 14:34.955
[man] The word is "hoosegow."

14:35.038 --> 14:36.456
- [laughs]
- [boy] Definition?

14:36.539 --> 14:40.543
- [man] A colloquialism for...
- Are you really going out again?

14:40.627 --> 14:42.587
Are you really staying in again?

14:42.671 --> 14:44.380
Yeah, but it's not like I'm alone.

14:44.464 --> 14:47.300
I am engaging with all the
people in Internet-land.

14:47.383 --> 14:50.679
Plus, someone has already
liked one of my tweets.

14:50.762 --> 14:53.306
- Sol?
- That's not the point.

14:53.389 --> 14:57.143
The point is, if you have one of
these, you don't need to go out ever.

14:57.226 --> 15:00.438
Well, I'm going to actually
"engage" with a real human being.

15:00.522 --> 15:02.357
I have high hopes for this one.

15:02.440 --> 15:05.151
He's a yacht owner, slash architect,

15:05.234 --> 15:08.697
and his screen-name is Yachtchitect.

15:08.780 --> 15:14.285
How perfect for you. You really love
cleverly joined words and fancy people.

15:14.369 --> 15:19.165
But if it all goes sideways,
just tweet me... [laughs]

15:19.248 --> 15:21.710
And I will have the margaritas ready.

15:21.793 --> 15:23.670
I don't tweet.

15:23.753 --> 15:27.674
But just in case, real lime, no sour mix.

15:27.757 --> 15:29.968
- Light on the salt, rocks.
- [man] That is correct.

15:30.052 --> 15:32.846
[TV audience applauding]

15:35.598 --> 15:37.893
The word is "Negus."

15:38.810 --> 15:40.144
[cell phone chimes]

15:43.815 --> 15:45.191
Oh, my God...

15:48.070 --> 15:50.030
Grace?

15:51.031 --> 15:52.615
Guy!

15:52.699 --> 15:55.284
- I didn't know you were in town.
- My gosh. Look at you.

15:55.368 --> 15:57.829
- How pretty you are.
- Oh, thank you.

15:57.913 --> 16:00.957
Oh, how come you're not on the
top of a mountain somewhere?

16:03.126 --> 16:05.670
Why would I want to be
on a mountain somewhere

16:05.754 --> 16:09.549
when I can look at your beautiful
face instead of some Sherpa?

16:09.632 --> 16:14.220
I mean, except for Nagonkuk.
Now, that guy is breathtaking.

16:14.303 --> 16:15.972
[laughs]

16:16.056 --> 16:18.808
- How long are you here?
- Well, that's a good question.

16:19.893 --> 16:23.271
Tell you the truth, I'm getting
a little older, a little tired.

16:23.354 --> 16:28.068
I'm thinking about hanging up my hat.
Maybe I'll... stay here. I don't know.

16:28.151 --> 16:31.404
You?! You've never stayed in one
place longer than five minutes.

16:31.487 --> 16:35.742
Parachuting into volcanoes,
living with gorilla families.

16:36.993 --> 16:39.287
Well, to tell you the
truth, about six months ago,

16:39.370 --> 16:44.167
I was in the outer
regions of Mongolia, and...

16:44.250 --> 16:47.963
I was straddling this
improvised hygiene pit...

16:49.464 --> 16:52.175
and I suddenly thought, you know,

16:52.258 --> 16:54.218
I've never seen Breaking Bad.

16:55.804 --> 16:59.474
And I haven't had ice cream
in at least nine years.

16:59.557 --> 17:01.309
I haven't either.

17:01.392 --> 17:02.936
[laughs]

17:04.771 --> 17:08.523
Have you... have you talked to
Robert since you've been back?

17:08.608 --> 17:10.318
No. I heard rumors, though.

17:10.401 --> 17:13.613
I guess he's on an adventure
of his own, isn't he.

17:13.695 --> 17:17.200
Well, that's an interesting way to put it.

17:19.535 --> 17:21.163
Hey.

17:22.538 --> 17:23.580
How are you?

17:25.415 --> 17:28.795
Every day a little better. In
fact, I'm waiting for a date.

17:28.878 --> 17:30.964
- It's an Internet thing.
- What's the Internet?

17:31.923 --> 17:33.633
- I'm kidding.
- [laughs]

17:33.716 --> 17:36.970
Hasn't been that long. So, what's he like?

17:37.053 --> 17:41.307
All I really know is he's
a yacht-owning architect.

17:41.390 --> 17:43.643
- Well, I hope it goes well.
- Thank you.

17:50.399 --> 17:53.111
- Oh, my gosh, is that him?
- [whispers] I think so.

17:53.195 --> 17:55.404
Jesus.

17:55.488 --> 17:58.449
Okay, you've got about seven
seconds before he sees you.

17:58.533 --> 18:01.036
- So what would you like to do?
- Can you make me invisible?

18:01.119 --> 18:03.913
No, I can't, but I can get
you out of here the back way

18:03.997 --> 18:05.790
before he sees you, at least. All right?

18:05.874 --> 18:10.045
On one condition, you agree
to have ice cream with me.

18:10.128 --> 18:12.172
- You've got three seconds.
- It's a deal.

18:12.255 --> 18:13.339
Okay.

18:13.422 --> 18:18.427
I know this is probably
a lot to get used to,

18:18.511 --> 18:22.724
and obviously, you're new
at this, I'm new at this.

18:22.807 --> 18:26.769
Um, and, I guess the great news is,
it's only for the rest of our lives.

18:26.853 --> 18:29.022
Right? Actually for the rest of your life,

18:29.105 --> 18:34.277
because I'm gonna probably
live a lot longer... than you.

18:35.695 --> 18:37.613
[Frankie] The Explorer Inside Me?

18:37.697 --> 18:41.117
- Ooh, fun read!
- Yeah, it is!

18:41.201 --> 18:43.036
Do you know that I've known Guy 40 years

18:43.119 --> 18:45.205
and I've never read
one of his books before?

18:45.288 --> 18:46.748
- You know him?!
- Yeah.

18:46.831 --> 18:48.457
- He's a big deal!
- Really?

18:48.541 --> 18:50.459
He's an old friend of
Robert's from college.

18:50.543 --> 18:52.670
Oh, my God! What is he like?

18:52.754 --> 18:56.632
Well, he's just a great
guy. He's fun, he's handsome.

18:56.716 --> 18:59.719
- He ate his best friend.
- What?!

18:59.802 --> 19:02.972
You remember the plane crash in
Siberia with his friend Harris,

19:03.056 --> 19:05.600
who told him to eat him so
that they both wouldn't die.

19:05.683 --> 19:07.351
He wrote a book about that.

19:07.435 --> 19:10.605
He really should have called
that one The Explorer Inside Me.

19:10.688 --> 19:12.107
Yeah, you're thinking of somebody else.

19:12.190 --> 19:13.900
- That's not Guy.
- Mm, mm.

19:13.983 --> 19:16.402
It's that movie about the soccer team.

19:16.485 --> 19:19.155
- And his book Eating Harris.
- You're making this up.

19:19.239 --> 19:20.865
- No.
- In this book,

19:20.949 --> 19:24.493
- he's sailing down the Amazon.
- Oh, that's not the good one.

19:24.577 --> 19:27.247
I mean, it's good, but it's
more a spiritual journey.

19:27.330 --> 19:29.832
- You know the jaguar that's stalking him?
- Yeah.

19:29.916 --> 19:32.210
Turns out to be just a metaphor. [gasps]

19:32.294 --> 19:33.836
Well, thanks.

19:35.588 --> 19:37.299
So you're going to go out with this guy?

19:37.381 --> 19:39.675
Yes. I am.

19:39.759 --> 19:42.011
He's a worldly, fascinating man,

19:42.095 --> 19:44.139
and I haven't met too many of those lately.

19:44.222 --> 19:49.269
Well, okay. But if this date turns
out like the last ones, just bail.

19:49.352 --> 19:52.188
The spelling bee and margaritas
are still on the table.

19:52.272 --> 19:55.066
Thanks, I don't think
that's gonna happen, though.

19:55.150 --> 19:57.568
This... this feels different.

19:57.652 --> 20:00.655
That's probably what he said
to Harris while he ate his foot.

20:03.449 --> 20:08.204
? Come and eat these nice pieces of meat ?

20:08.288 --> 20:13.793
? And then hang out with
your owner, Brianna ?

20:13.876 --> 20:16.754
Oh, my God. What is wrong with you?

20:16.838 --> 20:19.507
You're a rescue dog. You're
supposed to be desperate.

20:22.760 --> 20:24.846
Why won't you love me?

20:26.848 --> 20:29.392
[man] The word is... "Fartlek."

20:29.475 --> 20:33.229
- Please repeat.
- [man] Fartlek.

20:33.313 --> 20:35.690
Fartlek, fartlek...

20:35.773 --> 20:38.151
Oh God, Josiah, come
on. You've got to do it.

20:38.234 --> 20:39.735
- [man] Fartlek.
- Please do it.

20:39.819 --> 20:41.779
- Country of origin?
- He's just got to.

20:41.863 --> 20:44.032
- I know he's gonna do it.
- [man] Sweden.

20:44.115 --> 20:48.286
- Oh there! He did it! He did it!
- Fartlek, fartlek...

20:48.370 --> 20:49.996
[phone ringing]

20:50.079 --> 20:52.207
- Definition?
- Hello?

20:52.290 --> 20:54.667
- Hey Frankie, it's Mike.
- Hi, Mike.

20:54.750 --> 20:55.751
Is this a good time?

20:55.835 --> 20:57.879
It's always a good time to talk to you.

20:57.962 --> 20:59.255
So how is everything going?

20:59.339 --> 21:02.300
Well, you just missed Marinda just before.

21:02.384 --> 21:05.511
She flat-tired on some
junior varsity bullshit.

21:05.594 --> 21:07.055
Her parents are going to kill her!

21:07.138 --> 21:08.848
- And now... I'm sorry?
- What?

21:08.931 --> 21:11.309
- What?
- Well, you know, the spelling bee!

21:11.393 --> 21:13.353
I told you I watch it every year.

21:13.436 --> 21:16.398
Oh yeah, right, right, right. Yeah.
Sounds like you're enjoying that.

21:16.480 --> 21:19.192
Oh, God, well, I tried to
"join the conversation," Mike,

21:19.275 --> 21:23.571
like you and I talked about,
but nobody is talking back to me.

21:23.654 --> 21:27.575
You know, Frankie, the Internet's
not like a real conversation.

21:27.658 --> 21:30.661
It's just a bunch of people
screaming into the void.

21:30.745 --> 21:34.082
- For a real conversation, you need...
- I know, I know, Mike.

21:34.165 --> 21:36.792
You... you need real people.

21:38.253 --> 21:40.504
- Right?
- Right.

21:40.588 --> 21:42.173
Right.

21:42.257 --> 21:43.883
[doorbell rings]

21:52.975 --> 21:56.062
- Oh, my gosh, he's stalling!
- Playing for time.

21:56.145 --> 21:59.315
- [boy] What is the country of origin?
- "Country of origin?" You criminal!

21:59.399 --> 22:01.734
[Sol] Where does he think
"vinaigrette" comes from? Japan?!

22:01.817 --> 22:04.279
[laughter]

22:04.362 --> 22:06.697
- Can you use it in a sentence?
- Oh, come on!

22:06.781 --> 22:08.616
You're a bum!

22:10.326 --> 22:12.370
- Robert! Hi.
- Frankie.

22:13.913 --> 22:15.415
You were out.

22:16.916 --> 22:18.251
I'm home now.

22:18.334 --> 22:21.170
- Welcome home!
- I bought some key lime pie.

22:21.254 --> 22:25.174
Oh, that's nice. Sol loves the lime.

22:25.258 --> 22:26.301
Don't let me interrupt.

22:26.384 --> 22:29.178
- You're not. Stay.
- I'm going to head for home.

22:29.262 --> 22:31.097
But it's not over yet.

22:31.180 --> 22:32.640
[whispers] Sol, it's over.

22:35.643 --> 22:38.562
- See you, Robert.
- [Robert] Good night, Frankie.

22:38.646 --> 22:40.773
- [bell dings]
- [man] That is incorrect.

22:41.899 --> 22:43.234
[door closes]

22:43.318 --> 22:45.403
So, tell me everything. How was dinner?

22:45.487 --> 22:47.530
It was good. It was good.

22:47.613 --> 22:49.865
Everyone was there that
I told you would be there.

22:49.949 --> 22:52.743
If you have something to say to
me, please come out and say it.

22:52.827 --> 22:54.954
- What would I have to say to you?
- I don't know.

22:55.037 --> 22:58.833
Are you having some sort of problem
with Frankie and me watching TV?

22:58.916 --> 23:00.502
No.

23:00.584 --> 23:03.754
Are you having a problem with me
having a relationship with her?

23:03.838 --> 23:04.839
No.

23:04.922 --> 23:06.966
Will you answer with more than one word?

23:07.049 --> 23:09.385
Okay. What I'm having a problem with,

23:09.469 --> 23:12.013
Sol, is your not telling
me she was coming over.

23:12.096 --> 23:14.765
I didn't even know she was coming over.

23:14.849 --> 23:18.353
- I can explain exactly what...
- I don't want to hear it.

23:18.436 --> 23:22.482
Both our wives heard 20 years
of very good explanations.

23:22.565 --> 23:25.985
I recognize this behavior, Sol,
and it scares the shit out of me.

23:26.068 --> 23:29.489
I didn't mean to scare you.

23:29.572 --> 23:33.451
This is nothing like that. But I get it.

23:35.411 --> 23:36.662
- You do?
- I do.

23:36.745 --> 23:39.832
But do you get it that Frankie's
always gonna be a big part of my life?

23:39.915 --> 23:41.459
I do.

23:41.543 --> 23:45.213
I hope this is not what
our wedding vows sound like.

23:45.296 --> 23:46.672
[laughs]

23:46.755 --> 23:49.175
Why did you come home early?

23:49.258 --> 23:52.011
Did Al start getting morose
about Whitney Houston again?

23:52.094 --> 23:54.722
No. I just felt bad about leaving you alone

23:54.805 --> 23:56.391
- to watch the spelling bee.
- Aww.

23:56.474 --> 23:59.768
And I'm afraid Al will
never get over Ms. Houston.

23:59.852 --> 24:03.439
- [man] Sardoodledom.
- Sardoodledom.

24:05.024 --> 24:07.818
S-A-R...
D...

24:07.902 --> 24:11.655
- You wanna watch the rest of it?
- I thought you'd never ask.

24:11.739 --> 24:13.741
The hell with the tea. I'll get some wine.

24:13.824 --> 24:15.493
- Yes!
- Sardoodledom.

24:15.577 --> 24:17.661
- Hey, Brianna.
- Oh, thank God, thank God.

24:17.745 --> 24:20.706
- Is Leo okay?
- I'm actually calling him "Spit" now.

24:20.789 --> 24:22.708
- Is Spit okay?
- He's hiding.

24:22.791 --> 24:25.420
- Is that the emergency?
- No. He's hiding from me.

24:25.503 --> 24:27.463
- He hates me. I can't keep him.
- Why not?

24:27.547 --> 24:30.883
Because he's an asshole! And
he makes me feel like shit.

24:30.966 --> 24:33.344
I thought that dogs were supposed
to love you unconditionally.

24:33.428 --> 24:35.555
Isn't that the whole point?
You have to take him back.

24:35.638 --> 24:37.890
The dog is broken.

24:37.973 --> 24:39.975
One of you certainly is.

24:40.059 --> 24:43.145
- I prefer to think that it's the dog.
- Well, I'm enjoying thinking it's you.

24:43.229 --> 24:45.731
Why do I care what a guy who
has six dogs thinks of me?

24:45.814 --> 24:48.651
Five. And there are some women who
think that makes me compassionate.

24:48.734 --> 24:52.071
Well, I think it makes you really weird.
What are you doing with all those dogs?

24:52.154 --> 24:55.032
Why did you really want me to come over?

24:55.116 --> 24:57.660
Why do you think that I
wanted you to come over here?

24:57.743 --> 25:01.830
I just thought that you wanted me to...

25:03.374 --> 25:04.833
come over.

25:06.377 --> 25:07.378
Oh...

25:09.004 --> 25:11.633
Well, then, yes, I did.

25:16.345 --> 25:18.722
Do you want some brisket?

25:18.806 --> 25:20.975
[blender whirring]

25:24.270 --> 25:26.355
- [audience applause]
- [man] Welcome back.

25:27.398 --> 25:30.067
As we reach the final
night of the tournament,

25:30.151 --> 25:35.239
the feeling in the room can only
be described as sesquipedalian.

25:35.323 --> 25:37.783
Who gives a shit?

25:37.866 --> 25:41.787
I came to in the middle of the
Irrawaddy River on a bamboo raft,

25:41.870 --> 25:46.875
and I had to improvise these oars,
'cause I could only row with one hand.

25:46.959 --> 25:49.712
The venom had rendered my
right arm completely useless...

25:49.795 --> 25:51.380
Did you really eat somebody?

25:52.715 --> 25:57.720
Yes, I did. Would you like
to know some more about it?

25:57.803 --> 26:01.390
Actually, no. I didn't
even want to know that.

26:01.474 --> 26:04.185
Okay, fine, well, let's talk about you.

26:04.268 --> 26:10.024
Now why haven't you had or
enjoyed ice cream in so many years?

26:10.107 --> 26:13.110
I've been denying myself.

26:13.194 --> 26:15.446
Apparently, I'm quite good at that.

26:16.656 --> 26:19.534
[sharp exhale] So...

26:25.039 --> 26:26.248
Mmm.

26:28.209 --> 26:33.339
- I forgot how amazing it is.
- Yes. Hey, have you ever had Kulfi?

26:33.422 --> 26:34.757
There is a street vendor

26:34.840 --> 26:37.426
- in Mumbai who is...
- [laughs]

26:37.510 --> 26:40.095
- What's so funny?
- Mumbai.

26:40.179 --> 26:43.182
I mean, you've been everywhere,
Guy. You've done everything.

26:43.265 --> 26:46.394
And you're telling me you really
want to settle down in San Diego?

26:46.477 --> 26:50.105
I told you. I'm tired, Grace.

26:50.189 --> 26:53.526
I feel like I've heard that before.

26:53.609 --> 26:55.653
Maybe when I set you up with Dede.

26:55.737 --> 26:58.947
Oh, my gosh. That was a long time ago.

26:59.031 --> 27:00.949
Yeah, you said the same things then.

27:01.033 --> 27:04.161
Well, there's a big difference
between then and now.

27:04.245 --> 27:06.622
I'm thirty years older.

27:06.706 --> 27:09.333
And then there's... there's you.

27:11.753 --> 27:14.963
- I don't... I don't know, Guy...
- Don't you want to find out?

27:15.047 --> 27:16.298
- [sighs]
- Hmm?

27:16.382 --> 27:21.429
Grace, I think there was always
a spark between you and I?

27:21.512 --> 27:23.681
Maybe...

27:23.765 --> 27:25.266
but... [clears throat]

27:25.349 --> 27:28.102
Given my recent history,
I'm a little risk-averse.

27:28.185 --> 27:29.853
I love taking risks.

27:29.937 --> 27:32.898
- Let's start with the ice cream.
- All right.

27:32.981 --> 27:34.400
Here's the ground rules.

27:34.483 --> 27:37.027
You can't give a guy ten
minutes and a scoop of ice cream

27:37.111 --> 27:41.240
and then tell him to hit the
road. That's all I'm saying. Deal?

27:43.867 --> 27:46.370
[laughs]

27:46.454 --> 27:48.497
Mmm-mm!

27:51.542 --> 27:54.336
God, your hair is super soft.

27:54.420 --> 27:56.714
Thank you, I
use a two-in-one.

28:17.109 --> 28:18.986
- Wait.
- Yeah?

28:19.069 --> 28:20.655
Um...

28:20.738 --> 28:24.575
Do you want to eat something? I
don't mean like a four course meal.

28:24.659 --> 28:27.620
I mean, like a frozen
vegan pizza or something.

28:27.703 --> 28:29.204
I don't know why I buy those things,

28:29.288 --> 28:32.500
I always end up just piling a mountain
of cheese on top of 'em anyway.

28:32.583 --> 28:33.751
[chuckles]

28:33.835 --> 28:37.004
Yeah, you know, actually, I
really gotta get home to the dogs.

28:37.087 --> 28:38.673
Yes, of course.

28:41.843 --> 28:44.094
I'm sorry. Did I get this wrong?

28:44.178 --> 28:46.514
No.

28:46.597 --> 28:48.850
No, it's all good.

28:48.932 --> 28:50.976
Hey, don't give up on Spit, all right?

28:51.059 --> 28:53.813
You guys are gonna be
really good for each other.

28:53.896 --> 28:56.982
- Hey, let me walk you out.
- No, no, no, it's all right.

28:57.065 --> 28:58.567
Thanks.

29:00.611 --> 29:03.489
[door opens, closes]

29:18.128 --> 29:20.130
You like me.

29:22.299 --> 29:24.092
You love me.

29:26.178 --> 29:27.680
You smell.

29:27.763 --> 29:31.016
Well, this has been really fun.

29:31.099 --> 29:34.937
- Thank you for the ice cream.
- Well, it was my pleasure.

29:35.020 --> 29:36.063
Any time.

29:36.146 --> 29:38.816
[man] The word is "Ecdysiast."

29:38.900 --> 29:43.445
- [boy] What is the definition?
- [man] An exotic dancer.

29:43.529 --> 29:46.908
Grace, I was hoping that we
could see each other again...

29:49.117 --> 29:51.119
E-C...

29:55.249 --> 29:59.211
Oh, my. Oh.

29:59.294 --> 30:01.296
I wasn't expecting that.

30:01.380 --> 30:03.549
Neither was I.

30:06.468 --> 30:08.512
Good night, then.

30:08.596 --> 30:10.514
Good night, Guy.

30:13.141 --> 30:15.394
Yeah, well, I wasn't expecting that either.

30:17.438 --> 30:23.068
A-D-O-P-T-E-R-I-S-T.

30:23.151 --> 30:25.112
Lepidopterist.

30:25.195 --> 30:28.073
- No! Hector! No!
- [man] That is incorrect.

30:28.156 --> 30:31.702
What kind of a kid doesn't know
how to spell "Lepidopterist?"

30:31.786 --> 30:33.788
[Sol laughs]

30:34.538 --> 30:38.125
- You hate this, don't you?
- More than life itself!

30:38.208 --> 30:42.630
- [boy] B-I-B-L-O-U...
- Yes.

30:42.713 --> 30:46.467
- Yes, yes!
- S. Bibulous.

30:46.550 --> 30:47.676
Yay.

30:47.760 --> 30:50.930
- [man] That is correct.
- Yay!

30:54.308 --> 30:57.019
[man] The word is... "psoriasis."

30:57.102 --> 30:58.896
Can you repeat the word, please?

30:58.980 --> 31:00.522
[man] Psoriasis.

31:01.941 --> 31:04.359
Psoriasis.
