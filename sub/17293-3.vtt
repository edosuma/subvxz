00:00.867 --> 00:04.303
- <i>Previously on</i> The Vampire Diaries...
- Caroline Elizabeth Forbes,

00:04.328 --> 00:06.474
I want you to marry me.

00:06.476 --> 00:09.498
- Yes.
- I've seen that symbol before.

00:09.523 --> 00:12.046
<i>I saw it when I was dead.
This thing that was delivered</i>

00:12.048 --> 00:14.715
<i>with your vault inhabitant?
I think it was made in Hell.</i>

00:14.717 --> 00:17.255
ALARIC: <i>Sirens use mind
control to lure their victims</i>

00:17.280 --> 00:19.594
<i>to their death. Some say
they're messengers of the devil.</i>

00:19.619 --> 00:22.192
We are talking about a living,
breathing thing siren.

00:22.217 --> 00:26.000
The more specific my thoughts are, the
more she can key in on me psychically.

00:26.025 --> 00:28.259
- What does she want with you?
- She wants two loyal soldiers

00:28.283 --> 00:29.313
to keep bringing her supper.

00:29.337 --> 00:30.965
<i>Well, my mind is bonded to hers.</i>

00:30.967 --> 00:32.833
Every moment we spend
together is another moment

00:32.835 --> 00:34.702
she could discover how I feel about you.

00:34.704 --> 00:37.538
Why haven't I seen her before?

00:37.540 --> 00:41.058
- Damon's not gone.
- STEFAN: <i>Yeah, he is. I saw it happen.</i>

00:41.083 --> 00:42.613
He belongs to the siren now.

00:42.638 --> 00:44.245
- I'm Elena.
- I'm Damon.

00:44.247 --> 00:45.780
Don't worry about your brother.

00:45.782 --> 00:46.910
<i>I've taken over</i>

00:46.935 --> 00:48.426
<i>his last mental refuge.</i>

00:48.451 --> 00:50.584
<i>I'm giving it a little remodel.</i>

00:50.586 --> 00:52.687
Hi. What's your name?

00:52.689 --> 00:53.654
I'm Damon.

00:53.656 --> 00:54.889
I'm Sybil.

01:08.826 --> 01:11.346
We're gonna be okay. I promise.

Sheriff, we found the third victim.

01:49.543 --> 01:51.710
Was it an accident?

02:18.109 --> 02:21.444
Did you know her?

No, I never met her.

02:54.444 --> 02:56.177
I've got big plans for you

02:56.179 --> 02:57.317
and it'll streamline the

02:57.342 --> 02:59.084
whole process if your emotions

02:59.109 --> 03:00.625
aren't riding shotgun.

03:00.650 --> 03:03.584
Come on, Enzo. Room
service is getting cold.

03:03.586 --> 03:06.353
Well, if you're feeling peckish,
don't let me stop you.

03:09.459 --> 03:11.525
(grunts)

03:11.527 --> 03:13.316
Look at Damon over there. He's got

03:13.341 --> 03:15.696
the right idea. He's happy.

03:15.698 --> 03:17.465
Bored, actually.

03:17.467 --> 03:18.833
Just kill him.

03:18.858 --> 03:21.444
SYBIL: In three millennia,
I have a pretty unblemished record

03:21.469 --> 03:23.435
when it comes to controlling men.

03:23.437 --> 03:25.638
50,000 to zero...

03:25.663 --> 03:28.282
Give or take a few Peloponnesians...

03:28.307 --> 03:29.524
And I'm not about to add one

03:29.549 --> 03:30.943
to the loss column just because

03:30.945 --> 03:32.878
he doesn't feel like submitting.

03:32.880 --> 03:34.580
DAMON: Well, he's a tough nut crack.

03:34.582 --> 03:36.849
70 years in a cage'll do that to you,

03:36.874 --> 03:40.296
and you're just building up
his tolerance for torture.

03:40.321 --> 03:42.557
(exhales)

03:42.582 --> 03:44.316
Well I've got a pretty full itinerary,

03:44.318 --> 03:46.017
so I guess we're just gonna have to

03:46.019 --> 03:47.575
move on to Plan “B.”

03:47.600 --> 03:50.522
"B" as in "Bonnie."

03:50.524 --> 03:53.458
Which will be about as
effective as Plan "A."

03:53.483 --> 03:55.278
She means nothing to me.

03:55.303 --> 03:57.395
SYBIL: Is that so?

03:57.397 --> 04:00.198
I guess we'll find out.

04:00.200 --> 04:02.160
- Damon?
- Hmm?

04:02.185 --> 04:06.204
Would you do me a favor
and kill Bonnie Bennett?

04:07.507 --> 04:08.907
Sure.

04:20.887 --> 04:22.320
(chuckles softly)

04:23.759 --> 04:24.693
Surprise!

04:24.718 --> 04:27.201
- Bonnie, what the...
- (laughing)

04:27.226 --> 04:29.466
You are engaged,

04:29.491 --> 04:31.001
and we are celebrating.

04:31.003 --> 04:32.469
(giggles) First,

04:32.494 --> 04:34.161
we're gonna drink too much champagne.

04:34.163 --> 04:35.952
And then, I am taking
you wedding dress shopping.

04:35.976 --> 04:37.694
I know it's a little early,
but you're gonna try on

04:37.718 --> 04:40.326
thousands of dresses before
you find the perfect one,

04:40.351 --> 04:41.655
so we may as well start now.

04:41.680 --> 04:42.980
Bonnie, look,

04:42.982 --> 04:45.781
I love you, and this is amazing,

04:45.806 --> 04:48.118
but you don't have to put on
a happy face for me right now.

04:48.120 --> 04:50.276
I'm not putting it on.

04:50.301 --> 04:52.489
I'm not, I'm happy for you.

04:52.491 --> 04:54.825
I promise. Care, you asked me

04:54.827 --> 04:55.926
to be your bridesmaid

04:55.928 --> 04:57.527
when we were ten years old.

04:57.529 --> 04:59.763
You've been waiting for
this your whole life.

04:59.765 --> 05:01.098
I'm happy for you.

05:01.100 --> 05:02.766
I swear.

05:02.768 --> 05:05.742
(cork hits wall, both yell and laugh)

05:05.767 --> 05:07.804
Okay, but I promise

05:07.806 --> 05:09.606
we are going to find Enzo

05:09.608 --> 05:11.375
and you two are gonna be happy

05:11.377 --> 05:12.809
and you're gonna get
married on the top of

05:12.811 --> 05:15.245
- the Eiffel Tower...
- First things first,

05:15.247 --> 05:16.680
planning your June wedding.

05:16.682 --> 05:17.915
Oh, my God.

05:17.917 --> 05:19.549
Yes! The June wedding!

05:19.551 --> 05:20.817
The June wedding.

05:20.819 --> 05:22.986
(both laugh)

05:22.988 --> 05:25.188
And...

05:26.716 --> 05:29.191
You snuck into my house and
found my old wedding book?

05:29.216 --> 05:32.296
How else was I gonna
out-Caroline-Forbes Caroline Forbes?

05:32.298 --> 05:35.565
Bonnie, this is amazing.

05:35.567 --> 05:37.401
You're amazing.

05:37.403 --> 05:39.569
Thank you.

05:39.571 --> 05:41.705
You're welcome.

05:42.541 --> 05:43.874
I'm getting married!

05:43.876 --> 05:45.075
Yay!

05:45.077 --> 05:47.010
(laughter)

05:47.012 --> 05:49.646
Okay, now that I have a
drink in you, I have to ask.

05:49.648 --> 05:51.260
Mm-hmm?

05:51.285 --> 05:53.750
How did Ric take the news?

05:53.752 --> 05:56.620
Seriously, I'm fine with it.

05:56.622 --> 05:58.188
Yeah, Caroline said you were,

05:58.213 --> 06:00.303
but I just wanted to talk to
you myself, that's all.

06:00.328 --> 06:01.258
(chuckles)

06:01.260 --> 06:03.393
Well, I got two unused
flower girl dresses

06:03.395 --> 06:05.462
I'll sell you cheap.

06:05.464 --> 06:07.130
(scoffs)

06:07.132 --> 06:08.337
- Come on, man.
- (door opens and closes)

06:08.361 --> 06:09.833
Don't make me work this hard to show you

06:09.835 --> 06:11.110
I'm fine with it. Really.

06:11.135 --> 06:12.211
Yeah, he's fine with it.

06:12.236 --> 06:16.707
Hey, uh, why don't you guys go
get set up in the office, okay?

06:16.709 --> 06:18.953
Nanny had the morning off
so I had to work from home.

06:18.978 --> 06:22.679
Got them digging through
miles of arcane siren research.

06:22.681 --> 06:25.084
And what do they, uh,
think that they're doing?

06:25.109 --> 06:26.787
- Earning extra credit.
- Ah.

06:26.789 --> 06:28.756
Helping me with an urgent
publishing deadline.

06:28.758 --> 06:30.724
And how's that deadline coming along?

06:30.726 --> 06:32.026
Caroline said you
might've figured out how

06:32.028 --> 06:33.956
the, uh, Armory captured the siren

06:33.981 --> 06:34.895
in the first place.

06:34.897 --> 06:37.431
Well, if by "figured out"
you mean wild speculation

06:37.433 --> 06:38.866
based on centuries-old

06:38.868 --> 06:41.835
circumstantial evidence...

06:41.837 --> 06:43.684
I think they may have used this.

06:45.406 --> 06:46.772
Would it be going out

06:46.774 --> 06:49.608
on a limb to say that
we stab her with it?

06:49.610 --> 06:51.210
Possibly.

06:51.212 --> 06:52.578
We're dealing with
something that has the power

06:52.580 --> 06:53.912
of mind control.

06:53.914 --> 06:55.180
We get close to her

06:55.182 --> 06:57.049
and we're wrong?

06:58.819 --> 07:00.752
Then we're hers.

07:01.276 --> 07:04.857
♪ Do I look lonely ♪

07:04.859 --> 07:06.658
Let's talk silhouettes.

07:06.660 --> 07:08.427
Focus on A-lines and sheaths.

07:08.429 --> 07:11.096
I'm open to trumpets,
but easy on the volume.

07:11.098 --> 07:12.397
Less dress, more bride.

07:12.399 --> 07:14.066
- Exactly. Thank you.
- Okay.

07:14.068 --> 07:15.634
You're welcome. I'll be right back.

07:17.738 --> 07:20.639
Now, let's get to work
finding you the perfect

07:20.641 --> 07:22.274
maid of honor dress.

07:22.276 --> 07:26.111
Aw, I'd be honored to be your...
maid of honor.

07:26.113 --> 07:27.946
- (chuckles)
- And not just because

07:27.948 --> 07:29.748
my main competition
is in a coma till I die.

07:29.750 --> 07:31.083
(chuckles) Good.

07:31.085 --> 07:32.718
Because I'm going to do everything

07:32.720 --> 07:35.787
within my bridal power
to make sure you and Enzo

07:35.789 --> 07:37.589
live happily ever after.

07:37.591 --> 07:39.157
I've got killer aim...

07:40.461 --> 07:43.595
and no qualms about
rigging the bouquet toss.

07:43.597 --> 07:44.696
(chuckles) You ready?

07:44.698 --> 07:45.697
Yup.

07:45.699 --> 07:48.700
Catch!

07:48.702 --> 07:50.969
Damon, what are you...

07:54.383 --> 07:55.615
Bonnie, run.

07:59.083 --> 08:01.079
Oh, looks like little
brother's getting married, huh?

08:01.081 --> 08:05.183
Consider this my RSVP.

08:05.185 --> 08:07.519
(grunts)

08:08.589 --> 08:10.689
Bonnie?

08:13.093 --> 08:16.828
I can hear your broken little
heart beating, Bonnie.

08:20.467 --> 08:23.001
Oh, poor Bon-bon.

08:23.003 --> 08:27.072
Literally always the bridesmaid.

08:27.074 --> 08:29.775
Never the bride.

08:29.777 --> 08:31.476
(yells)

08:33.480 --> 08:36.248
(grunting)

08:36.850 --> 08:38.582
(groans)

08:50.115 --> 08:51.779
(Damon groans)

08:53.962 --> 08:56.563
So, you got beat up by a girl?

08:56.565 --> 08:59.232
Two girls, if we're counting.

09:03.472 --> 09:04.818
What's so funny?

09:04.843 --> 09:08.708
Just admiring the ladies' craftsmanship.

09:08.710 --> 09:10.143
No.

09:10.145 --> 09:11.412
That look tells me

09:11.437 --> 09:13.230
that you know something I should know,

09:13.255 --> 09:15.081
but you don't want me to know.

09:15.083 --> 09:18.582
And you know how I feel about secrets.

09:21.757 --> 09:23.490
(groans)

09:25.925 --> 09:27.518
Looks like someone forgot to mention

09:27.520 --> 09:29.820
that you and Bonnie
have quite the history.

09:29.822 --> 09:31.956
No wonder your heart wasn't in it.

09:31.958 --> 09:33.757
Well,

09:33.782 --> 09:35.926
we'll see what we can do about that.

09:35.928 --> 09:37.294
Mm...

09:39.499 --> 09:41.966
- Oh, see how scared you are?
- <i>Just leave me alone or I'll scream.</i>

09:41.968 --> 09:43.934
(screams) <i>I know what you are, Damon.</i>

09:43.936 --> 09:46.170
One more move and I'm gonna take you out.

09:46.172 --> 09:49.607
- DAMON: <i>I can make it final.</i>
- BONNIE: <i>Everything that happens</i>

09:49.609 --> 09:51.509
- is his fault.
- DAMON: <i>You know I needed motivation.</i>

09:51.511 --> 09:53.244
- <i>You need motivation.</i>
- Get out!

09:53.246 --> 09:54.845
Whoa.

09:54.847 --> 09:57.314
That's a lot of bad road between you two.

09:57.316 --> 09:58.849
What am I missing?

10:00.086 --> 10:01.852
Oh, wait.

10:01.854 --> 10:03.642
There it is.

10:03.667 --> 10:07.024
Mm-hmm, got it.

10:07.026 --> 10:08.359
BONNIE: I'm sure there are a million people

10:08.361 --> 10:11.462
we'd both rather be with right now,

10:11.464 --> 10:12.730
but...

10:12.732 --> 10:15.332
Couple thousand at most.

10:15.896 --> 10:17.495
Do you think it'll hurt?

10:18.504 --> 10:20.538
DAMON: <i>I don't know.</i>

10:25.585 --> 10:27.418
Mm.

10:28.014 --> 10:29.380
Much better.

10:31.025 --> 10:33.192
Now...

10:35.185 --> 10:37.853
...we have work to do.

10:40.359 --> 10:42.993
Stefan, if Damon wants me dead,
then I'm dead.

10:42.995 --> 10:45.020
Why is he coming after ya?
It makes no sense.

10:45.045 --> 10:47.131
None of it makes sense.

10:47.133 --> 10:49.366
But we're gonna need
weapons, lots of them.

10:50.636 --> 10:53.237
(sighs) The throne is empty.

10:53.239 --> 10:55.330
Right. Yeah, sorry, I was child-proofing.

10:55.355 --> 10:57.251
But the crossbows are still in the library.

10:57.276 --> 10:59.477
Listen, I'm gonna try to track Damon,
and with any luck,

10:59.479 --> 11:01.812
the drone will lead us back to the queen.

11:01.814 --> 11:03.214
And when you find her?

11:04.350 --> 11:06.750
Ric's still working on that part.

11:06.752 --> 11:08.519
Your deadline just got moved up.

11:08.521 --> 11:10.020
You don't have days.

11:10.022 --> 11:12.690
You have hours.

11:17.330 --> 11:19.230
Do you think we can get away

11:19.232 --> 11:21.298
with not inviting Damon to the wedding?

11:21.300 --> 11:23.601
I mean, even if we do save him?

11:24.837 --> 11:26.670
He's gonna be your brother-in-law.

11:26.672 --> 11:28.772
And, likely, Stefan's best man.

11:28.774 --> 11:30.040
Sorry.

11:30.042 --> 11:32.343
(sighs) Fine, fine.

11:32.345 --> 11:34.349
But he is not sitting at the head table.

11:36.582 --> 11:38.516
Where is all the ammo?

11:39.852 --> 11:41.485
(phone ringing, vibrating)

11:41.487 --> 11:44.221
Calling me from your own phone.

11:44.223 --> 11:45.990
Gutsy.

11:45.992 --> 11:47.858
What makes you think I won't
use it to track you down?

11:47.860 --> 11:50.261
No need... I'm at the high school.

11:50.263 --> 11:51.545
Why would you tell me that?

11:51.570 --> 11:53.831
Because I'm gonna need a favor,
little brother.

11:53.833 --> 11:55.833
And what would that be?

11:55.835 --> 11:58.435
Whatever desire you have to save me,

11:58.437 --> 12:02.139
I kind of need that right now.

12:04.043 --> 12:06.076
I'm starting to consider
a destination wedding.

12:06.078 --> 12:07.912
Try finding a Mystic Falls venue

12:07.914 --> 12:10.147
that hasn't been the site
of a horrible atrocity.

12:13.586 --> 12:15.452
Hi, Bonnie.

12:15.454 --> 12:17.054
I'm Sybil.

12:18.206 --> 12:21.040
So glad to finally meet you.

12:31.213 --> 12:33.088
This is really nice work.

12:33.090 --> 12:34.656
Caroline, is it?

12:34.658 --> 12:36.958
I'm not sure about
riding in on the unicorn,

12:36.960 --> 12:40.829
but I love this charmeuse and
the tiara design is exquisite.

12:40.831 --> 12:44.433
Yeah well, I made that in the
sixth grade, so congratulations.

12:44.435 --> 12:47.269
You have the fashion
sense of an 11-year-old.

12:47.271 --> 12:50.572
I just want to know where Bonnie's is.

12:50.574 --> 12:52.441
Scrapbooking's not really my thing.

12:52.443 --> 12:54.343
- What do you want?
- Simple.

12:54.345 --> 12:56.945
I want to know what makes you so special.

12:56.947 --> 12:59.614
What is it about you
that has Enzo and Damon

12:59.616 --> 13:02.484
wrapped around those flawlessly manicured

13:02.486 --> 13:05.620
little fingers? I mean, I get Enzo.

13:05.622 --> 13:07.356
The accent, the star-crossed

13:07.358 --> 13:08.824
witch-vampire thing.

13:08.826 --> 13:10.058
No...

13:10.060 --> 13:11.693
it's the Damon of it all

13:11.695 --> 13:13.762
that has me so stumped.

13:13.764 --> 13:15.597
Did you guys ever...

13:15.599 --> 13:16.832
you know...

13:16.834 --> 13:18.133
No.

13:18.135 --> 13:19.601
All that time, alone in a prison world.

13:19.603 --> 13:21.223
Same day on repeat.

13:21.248 --> 13:24.223
You must've done something to break
up the brain-numbing monotony.

13:24.248 --> 13:25.207
No.

13:25.209 --> 13:26.241
Seriously?

13:26.243 --> 13:28.777
Look, you are gorgeous.

13:28.779 --> 13:30.712
I can admit that, I'm not blind.

13:30.714 --> 13:32.414
And neither is Damon.

13:32.416 --> 13:34.383
Who, in case you haven't noticed, ladies,

13:34.385 --> 13:36.351
is scorching. I mean... (scoffs)

13:36.353 --> 13:38.854
...you can't spell Damon without "damn."

13:38.856 --> 13:41.089
Strictly platonic?

13:41.091 --> 13:42.624
Really?

13:42.626 --> 13:44.025
Wow.

13:44.027 --> 13:45.427
Good for you.

13:45.429 --> 13:47.028
That doesn't explain how you inspire

13:47.030 --> 13:48.864
so much devotion in two men

13:48.866 --> 13:50.098
who are supposed to be

13:50.100 --> 13:52.868
completely devoted to me.

13:52.870 --> 13:55.103
So why don't you sit down
and we'll have a little

13:55.105 --> 13:56.538
heart-to-heart?

13:57.975 --> 13:59.307
I can make you.

14:00.144 --> 14:02.277
But it's excruciatingly painful.

14:02.279 --> 14:05.547
And it'll mess up your hair.

14:07.751 --> 14:10.288
GEORGIE: There's nothing
in the historical records

14:10.313 --> 14:11.520
about a weapon like this.

14:11.522 --> 14:13.021
Please tell me there's a "but".

14:13.023 --> 14:14.423
But I have a theory.

14:14.425 --> 14:15.891
Okay. So...

14:15.893 --> 14:17.859
assuming that the symbol etched into it

14:17.861 --> 14:20.595
has a connection to hell,

14:20.597 --> 14:22.917
what's the first thing you
think of when you think of hell?

14:24.001 --> 14:25.600
The devil, right?

14:25.602 --> 14:27.102
And what's the most common
visual representation

14:27.104 --> 14:28.370
of the devil?

14:28.372 --> 14:29.783
Uh, a man in a red suit.

14:29.808 --> 14:31.606
Pointy tail.

14:31.608 --> 14:34.476
- With a pitchfork.
- Ding-ding-ding.

14:34.478 --> 14:37.617
Okay, in the medieval tradition,
the pitchfork symbolized

14:37.642 --> 14:39.481
the separation of the
wheat from the chaff.

14:39.483 --> 14:41.216
Which was obviously a metaphor

14:41.218 --> 14:43.185
for good souls going to
heaven and garbage souls going

14:43.187 --> 14:45.454
to the big fiery basement.

14:45.456 --> 14:47.088
Well, shouldn't that have three tines?

14:47.090 --> 14:50.158
Not in 2200 B.C. when it was forged.

14:50.160 --> 14:52.394
The soil around the
Mediterranean was rocky.

14:52.396 --> 14:55.464
So their pitchforks only had two.

14:55.466 --> 14:57.032
Okay, well that's all very interesting,

14:57.034 --> 14:58.300
but that doesn't tell us anything

14:58.302 --> 14:59.568
about its connection to the sirens,

14:59.570 --> 15:01.937
- how we'd use it...
- We?

15:01.939 --> 15:03.738
Why would we use it? Like this is real?

15:03.740 --> 15:05.607
As in some sort of magical weapon?

15:05.609 --> 15:07.108
- Come on, you know what I mean.
- No.

15:07.110 --> 15:09.044
Actually, I don't.
You sure this is for a book?

15:09.046 --> 15:10.986
'Cause you're treating it
like lives are at stake.

15:11.010 --> 15:12.777
Worse.

15:14.785 --> 15:17.285
Tenure, okay?

15:17.287 --> 15:20.222
Now, keep digging.

15:23.760 --> 15:26.928
Look if this is all some
sort of an elaborate trap,

15:26.930 --> 15:30.065
we might as well skip to the
part where you spring it.

15:30.067 --> 15:32.601
No trap, elaborate or otherwise.

15:32.603 --> 15:35.170
I just need your help.

15:35.172 --> 15:37.739
With what?

15:39.009 --> 15:40.951
I can't tell you.

15:40.976 --> 15:43.623
No, I mean I literally can't tell you.

15:43.648 --> 15:46.882
I can't physically make
myself form the words.

15:46.884 --> 15:49.784
That's the thing about Sybil,
she's not big on free will.

15:49.786 --> 15:52.153
She kind of LoJacked my brain.

15:52.155 --> 15:53.889
Whenever I try and form the words

15:53.891 --> 15:55.156
to tell you what's going on,

15:55.158 --> 15:57.292
it just comes out applesauce penguin.

15:57.294 --> 16:00.128
Well, if you cant tell me how to
save you, then I'm at a loss,

16:00.130 --> 16:03.064
because I'm running out of ways
to pull you back from the brink.

16:03.066 --> 16:04.917
Sounds suspiciously like
someone's given up.

16:04.942 --> 16:05.734
Not yet.

16:05.736 --> 16:07.569
But I'm not about to let Elena wake up

16:07.571 --> 16:09.558

This isn't for Bonnie.

16:14.978 --> 16:17.045
♪ ♪

16:24.621 --> 16:27.989
So, Bonnie, what's your secret?

16:27.991 --> 16:30.458
What did Damon and Enzo see in you?

16:30.460 --> 16:32.727
I have no idea.

16:32.729 --> 16:34.262
Oh, come on, Bonnie.

16:34.264 --> 16:36.831
- Surely you can think of something.
- You know,

whatever you're trying to do here,
it's not going to work.

16:39.770 --> 16:41.803
You're not going to get what you want.

16:41.805 --> 16:44.039
Something you should know about Bonnie

16:44.041 --> 16:46.641
is that she is fiercely loyal

16:46.643 --> 16:49.778
and she would do anything
for the people she loves.

16:52.241 --> 16:54.247
Really?

16:55.419 --> 16:58.286
Now that is something we can work with.

16:58.288 --> 17:01.356
So you would do anything
for Damon and Enzo?

17:01.358 --> 17:03.515
Like, <i>anything</i> anything?

17:03.540 --> 17:06.094
I mean, how far would you really go?

17:07.130 --> 17:09.731
What if you had to choose between them?

17:09.733 --> 17:11.833
(chuckles)

17:13.036 --> 17:14.669
Here's the thing, ladies.

17:14.671 --> 17:17.305
I need two loyal soldiers,

17:17.307 --> 17:20.508
and these two can't seem to
cut loose from their ties

17:20.510 --> 17:21.910
to the past.

17:21.912 --> 17:23.877
It's working my last nerve.

17:23.880 --> 17:25.113
So, I realized,

17:25.115 --> 17:26.881
I really only need one of them.

17:26.883 --> 17:28.550
The other will die

17:28.551 --> 17:32.354
and live an eternity of
darkness and pain.

17:32.356 --> 17:34.089
(chuckles)

17:34.091 --> 17:35.790
So...

17:35.792 --> 17:37.726
Bonnie gets to choose.

17:38.629 --> 17:40.328
- You're crazy.
- No.

17:40.330 --> 17:42.197
I'm just very old,

17:42.199 --> 17:45.834
very set in my ways and very annoyed.

17:46.970 --> 17:49.270
Choose.

17:49.272 --> 17:52.707
I get it. You're jealous.

17:52.709 --> 17:55.443
You see a love that you didn't
have to siren someone into.

17:55.445 --> 17:58.780
A love that isn't all about you.
You're threatened.

17:58.782 --> 18:00.515
So, naturally you have to destroy it

20:39.679 --> 20:41.312
anything at all about no backup.

20:41.314 --> 20:43.614
And it's not my fault you
don't have any friends

20:43.616 --> 20:45.416
- to stand up for you.
- Oh, yes, yes.

20:45.418 --> 20:48.452
How naive of me to think
that you were my friend.

20:48.454 --> 20:50.087
I tried to be your friend, Enzo.

20:50.089 --> 20:51.355
Tried to convince you to give yourself

20:51.357 --> 20:53.658
- over to Sybil.
- Hey. If Enzo

20:53.660 --> 20:56.027
can fight this, why can't you, Damon?

20:56.029 --> 20:58.629
'Cause it's pointless, Stefan.

20:58.631 --> 21:00.431
We are in this mess

21:00.433 --> 21:02.066
because he refuses to accept that.

21:02.068 --> 21:03.768
But if he'd just sign over his pink slip

21:03.770 --> 21:06.304
to Sybil, we wouldn't be here.

21:06.306 --> 21:09.640
You can't kill Enzo.
Bonnie would never forgive you.

21:09.642 --> 21:12.043
Oh, don't bother, mate.
She's been messing around

21:12.045 --> 21:14.045
in the recesses of his brain,

21:14.047 --> 21:16.547
toying with the safe
places in his subconscious.

32:29.570 --> 32:31.515
old-fashioned tear your throat out?

32:31.540 --> 32:33.472
(tires squeal, thudding)

32:34.909 --> 32:36.809
SYBIL: I don't know who

32:36.811 --> 32:37.877
you are, but...

32:37.879 --> 32:39.912
(high-pitched tone echoes)

32:39.914 --> 32:42.782
(yelling)

32:51.926 --> 32:53.125
(yells)

32:54.923 --> 32:57.457
(groans)

33:02.036 --> 33:03.569
(bones cracking)

33:03.571 --> 33:05.304
Damon, it's over.

33:05.306 --> 33:06.672
You're free now.

33:06.674 --> 33:08.140
I wish that were the case, Stefan,

33:08.142 --> 33:10.176
but my work with her is
just getting started.

33:10.178 --> 33:11.677
What work?

33:11.679 --> 33:13.913
What does she want with you?

33:13.915 --> 33:17.149
Applesauce penguin, brother.

33:19.420 --> 33:21.554
(car engine starts)

33:21.556 --> 33:24.123
(engine revving)

33:28.963 --> 33:31.530
(crickets chirping)

33:34.954 --> 33:37.655
Maybe now we'll get some answers.

33:40.150 --> 33:42.517
You sure you can handle Enzo?

33:42.519 --> 33:44.686
I'll be fine.

33:44.688 --> 33:48.112
You know, if you need my help
with getting him to the cabin...

33:48.137 --> 33:49.858
I said I'll be fine.

33:49.860 --> 33:51.993
Okay.

33:51.995 --> 33:55.864
If it were up to you,
you would have picked Damon.

33:55.866 --> 33:58.066
(sighs)

33:58.068 --> 34:00.368
Yes.

34:00.370 --> 34:02.504
And you would've done it <i>knowing</i>

34:02.506 --> 34:05.073
that Enzo was the one fighting Sybil.

34:05.075 --> 34:08.109
The one risking his life to help us.

34:08.110 --> 34:10.110
- Yes.
- Let me ask you something.

34:10.112 --> 34:12.847
What <i>has</i> Damon done?

34:14.184 --> 34:16.551
Besides give up.

34:24.661 --> 34:27.829
She doesn't mean that. She's just upset.

34:27.831 --> 34:30.431
I'm gonna go stay with Bonnie tonight.

34:30.434 --> 34:31.766
She needs me.

34:31.768 --> 34:35.235
This has all been a lot for her.

34:35.237 --> 34:38.907
I hated us being on the opposite
side of the fight today.

34:38.909 --> 34:40.942
- I had to.
- I know.

34:40.944 --> 34:43.812
I know what you had to do.

34:43.813 --> 34:46.380
But I hated it.

34:48.051 --> 34:50.719
I hate all this.

34:53.290 --> 34:55.255
(sighs)

34:55.257 --> 34:57.792
I hate it, too.

35:14.578 --> 35:17.879
STEFAN: <i>Dear Elena,</i>

35:43.840 --> 35:47.976

36:14.471 --> 36:17.105
that if you have gotten him back before,

36:17.107 --> 36:19.974

I don't know. This is different.

36:27.250 --> 36:29.818
I've never seen him like this before.

36:29.820 --> 36:32.086
I really hoped that
when we put Sybil down,

36:32.088 --> 36:34.222
it'd break whatever
control she had over him.

36:34.224 --> 36:36.424
That he'd go back to being

to the end of time,

39:52.722 --> 39:55.056
of the moment you gave up.

39:55.058 --> 39:59.160

39:59.162 --> 40:02.063
