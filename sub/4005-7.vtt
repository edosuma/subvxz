LET HER GO? WHO IS HE?

26:23.041 --> 26:24.709
- PROBABLY A FORMER STUDENT,
RIGHT?

26:24.709 --> 26:26.583
I MEAN, HE KEPT REFERRING
TO GELLAR AS "PROFESSOR."

26:26.583 --> 26:28.667
- HOW DO WE GET AN I.D.
ON HIM?

26:28.667 --> 26:30.917
- WELL, GELLAR TAUGHT
AT TALLAHASSEE FOR 12 YEARS.

26:30.917 --> 26:33.667
400 STUDENTS PER YEAR,
4,800 NAMES.

26:33.667 --> 26:35.750
2,400 IF YOU EXCLUDE
FEMALES.

26:35.750 --> 26:37.625
- SO IF THEY'RE GONNA CONTINUE,

26:37.625 --> 26:39.583
THE BEST WAY FOR US TO STOP
THE NEXT MURDER FROM HAPPENING

26:39.583 --> 26:41.458
IS TO GET A NAME
ON GELLAR'S ACCOMPLICE

26:41.458 --> 26:44.625
IN A HAYSTACK OF 2,400
POTENTIAL SUSPECTS?

26:44.625 --> 26:46.709
FUCK JUST ISN'T ENOUGH
RIGHT NOW.

26:46.709 --> 26:48.875
- 2,400 IS NOT
THAT BIG A NUMBER.

26:48.875 --> 26:50.917
- UNLESS YOU'RE TALKING VIRGINS.

26:50.917 --> 26:52.792
- MAYBE I COULD BE
OF SOME HELP.

26:52.792 --> 26:55.250
I'LL WORK ON IT.

26:55.250 --> 26:56.917
- I WOULD KILL MYSELF,
BUT IT WOULD ADD

26:56.917 --> 26:58.625
TO MY MURDER TOTAL
FOR THE MONTH.

26:58.625 --> 27:00.125
- AT LEAST WE'RE CLOSER
TO CATCHING HIM

27:00.125 --> 27:01.333
THAN WE WERE THIS MORNING.

27:01.333 --> 27:04.208
- YEAH, I FEEL A LOT BETTER.

27:04.208 --> 27:08.083
WHERE THE FUCK IS DEXTER?

27:10.750 --> 27:13.375
- I PROMISE I WON'T
TELL ANYONE.

27:13.375 --> 27:16.709
- WELL, HOW DO I KNOW
I CAN TRUST YOU?

27:16.709 --> 27:20.750
- OH, WELL, THAT KISS
IS A CONTRACT, YOU KNOW.

27:20.750 --> 27:22.291
- COME ON.

27:22.291 --> 27:24.375
- OKAY, THIS IS ROUGH.

27:24.375 --> 27:27.750
AND IT'S NOT EVEN
A BETA VERSION, BUT...

27:27.750 --> 27:30.959
- [mild gasp]
YOU TOTALLY GOT MY BROTHER.

27:30.959 --> 27:34.291
EVEN DOWN TO THE WAY THAT HAT
SITS ON HIS BIG HEAD.

27:34.291 --> 27:35.792
IS HE, LIKE,
THE STAR OF YOUR GAME?

27:35.792 --> 27:37.291
- WELL, THE GAME IS MODELED
ON THE DEPARTMENT,

27:37.291 --> 27:41.041
SO IF HE'S THE LEAD ON A CASE,
THEN HE'S KIND OF THE STAR.

27:41.041 --> 27:42.125
- YEAH.
- YOU'RE REALLY SMART.

27:42.125 --> 27:45.667
- I KNOW.
[car door shuts]

27:45.667 --> 27:48.750
SOMEONE'S HERE.

27:48.750 --> 27:51.208
- DEBRA?
- HI. WHERE'S DEXTER?

27:51.208 --> 27:52.750
- ON A TRIP.

27:52.750 --> 27:56.000
- WHERE DID HE GO?
- I DON'T KNOW.

27:56.000 --> 27:57.625
THE KEYS?

27:57.625 --> 27:59.542
- HIS BOAT IS STILL DOCKED
AT THE MARINA.

27:59.542 --> 28:01.917
- WELL, MAYBE HE TOOK
HIS CAR.

28:01.917 --> 28:03.166
HAVE YOU TRIED CALLING HIM?

28:03.166 --> 28:06.166
- ABOUT A THOUSAND TIMES.

28:06.166 --> 28:07.667
BUT NOT FROM HERE.

28:07.667 --> 28:12.500
- IF YOU COULD GO SOMEWHERE
ELSE, WHERE WOULD IT BE?

28:12.500 --> 28:14.291
- I'VE NEVER BEEN TO PORTLAND.

28:14.291 --> 28:16.250
- THAT'S A LITTLE PREDICTABLE,
ISN'T IT?

28:16.250 --> 28:17.458
ISN'T THAT WHERE ALL
SERIAL KILLERS GO?

28:17.458 --> 28:20.000
[cell phone rings]

28:20.000 --> 28:22.333
HOME, SWEET HOME.
DON'T ANSWER THAT, DEXTER.

28:22.333 --> 28:24.834
- JAMIE? WHAT'S WRONG?

28:24.834 --> 28:29.291
- WHERE IN FUCKTOPIA ARE YOU?
- DEB. HI.

28:29.291 --> 28:32.625
- DID YOU GET MY MESSAGES?
WHAT'S THAT SOUND?

28:32.625 --> 28:34.625
- I CAN BARELY HEAR YOU.
THE RECEPTION'S TERRIBLE.

28:34.625 --> 28:36.667
- WE HAD A BREAKTHROUGH
ON THE DDK CASE.

28:36.667 --> 28:39.875
- DEB, I GOTTA GO.
- YOU KNOW...

28:39.875 --> 28:42.542
YOU COULD HAVE ASKED ME
BEFORE YOU JUST TOOK OFF.

28:42.542 --> 28:46.041
- YOU OFFERED ME
SOME TIME OFF.

28:46.041 --> 28:48.250
- I MEANT THE AFTERNOON,
NOT FIVE FUCKING DAYS

28:48.250 --> 28:50.875
TO GO WHEREVER IT IS
THAT YOU ARE!

28:50.875 --> 28:52.458
WHERE ARE YOU?

28:52.458 --> 28:56.083
- IT'S--I DON'T KNOW...

28:56.083 --> 28:58.709
PERSONAL.
- I'M YOUR SISTER.

28:58.709 --> 29:01.834
- THEN TELL MY LIEUTENANT THAT
I'LL BE BACK AS SOON AS I CAN.

29:01.834 --> 29:04.959
I'M SORRY,
YOU'RE BREAKING UP.

29:04.959 --> 29:07.208
WE DON'T HAVE MUCH TIME.
WE GOTTA DO JONAH'S NOW.

29:07.208 --> 29:09.041
- LET'S GO.

29:09.041 --> 29:11.500
- GOODY.

29:42.834 --> 29:46.208
THERE IT IS,
1965 WALNUT STREET.

29:46.208 --> 29:49.917
- HOME OF THE FAMILY FORMERLY
KNOWN AS THE MITCHELLS.

29:54.667 --> 29:57.875
- YOU WANT TO KILL HIM HERE
OR JUST LIE IN WAIT?

29:57.875 --> 30:01.583
- [sighs]
NEITHER.

30:01.583 --> 30:03.667
- THEN WHAT ARE WE
DOING HERE?

30:03.667 --> 30:06.458
- I DON'T KNOW FOR SURE
THAT HE'S GUILTY.

30:06.458 --> 30:07.834
- NOT THIS AGAIN.

30:07.834 --> 30:09.917
HARRY'S CODE.

30:09.917 --> 30:13.917
TELL ME WHY IT MATTERS
IF A PERSON IS GOOD OR BAD.

30:13.917 --> 30:16.542
DOES IT MAKE YOU FEEL BETTER
TO KILL BAD PEOPLE?

30:16.542 --> 30:17.709
- IT'S PART OF THE RITUAL.

30:17.709 --> 30:19.834
- YOU DON'T NEED
A JUSTIFICATION TO KILL.

30:19.834 --> 30:21.625
- THE CODE IS MORE THAN THAT.

30:21.625 --> 30:23.792
IT'S KEPT ME
FROM GETTING CAUGHT.

30:23.792 --> 30:25.667
IT'S GIVEN ME A LIFE.

30:25.667 --> 30:28.417
- A LIFE THAT IS
A BIG FAT LIE.

30:28.417 --> 30:31.542
JUST LIKE JONAH'S STORY.

30:31.542 --> 30:34.917
WHAT MORE PROOF DO YOU NEED
THAT JONAH'S GUILTY?

30:41.208 --> 30:44.166
- THE FBI DIDN'T PHOTOGRAPH
THE ENTIRE LIVING ROOM.

30:44.166 --> 30:47.667
MAYBE JONAH MADE
A ROOKIE MISTAKE.

30:47.667 --> 30:51.083
MY KNIVES!

30:51.083 --> 30:54.500
- I'M GUESSING
IT'S THE MOTEL GIMP.

30:54.500 --> 30:57.166
- WHOEVER IT IS ALSO TOOK
MY FORENSIC KIT.

30:57.166 --> 30:59.291
- NOW, THAT I DON'T MISS
SO MUCH.

31:14.875 --> 31:17.583
IT'S THE MIDWEST.

31:17.583 --> 31:19.333
NOBODY LOCKS THEIR DOORS.

31:39.291 --> 31:42.542
THERE'S NO BLOOD ANYWHERE.

31:42.542 --> 31:46.000
- [sniffs]

31:46.000 --> 31:48.250
BLEACH.

31:48.250 --> 31:50.000
HE CLEANED UP.

31:54.709 --> 31:57.333
REBECCA DIED IN THE BATHTUB
UPSTAIRS.

31:59.291 --> 32:02.625
- I'M BORED.

32:02.625 --> 32:04.959
WHY AREN'T WE SETTING UP
A KILL ROOM?

32:06.959 --> 32:08.917
- THIS IS WHERE JONAH
WOULD HAVE HAD TO STAND

32:08.917 --> 32:12.417
TO MAKE IT LOOK LIKE HIS FATHER
BEAT HIS MOTHER TO DEATH.

32:12.417 --> 32:15.959
- TRY IT.
TAKE A PRETEND SWING.

32:28.500 --> 32:31.417
NOT THE BEST CLEAN-UP JOB
I'VE EVER SEEN.

32:31.417 --> 32:33.709
- NOW FOR THE LIVING ROOM.

32:34.750 --> 32:37.375
- THIS IS THE KITCHEN.

32:37.375 --> 32:40.000
- I'M MAKING A TEST FOR BLEACH,
WHICH I WOULDN'T HAVE TO DO

32:40.000 --> 32:42.125
IF MY FORENSIC KIT
HADN'T BEEN STOLEN.

32:52.667 --> 32:55.750
- GET THE FUCK OUT
OF MY HOUSE.

32:58.250 --> 32:59.959
- SHOW ME WHERE IT HAPPENED,
JONAH.

32:59.959 --> 33:03.250
YOUR FATHER KILLED YOUR MOTHER
HERE, ON THIS STAIRCASE?

33:03.250 --> 33:05.041
- POLICE CAN BE HERE
IN THREE MINUTES.

33:05.041 --> 33:08.291
- HERE IS WHERE HER BODY WAS,
AND HERE...

33:08.291 --> 33:09.959
IS WHERE YOU CLEANED UP
YOUR MOTHER'S BLOOD.

33:09.959 --> 33:12.125
- YOU'RE A SICK FUCK,
YOU KNOW THAT?

33:12.125 --> 33:14.000
- WHERE'D YOU FIGHT YOUR FATHER
OFF--IT WAS HERE, RIGHT,

33:14.000 --> 33:16.458
WHEN YOU TOOK THE WEAPON
FROM HIM AND HIT HIM,

33:16.458 --> 33:18.625
CHASING HIM OFF?
- YEAH.

33:18.625 --> 33:20.125
- SWINGING AT HIM
THE WHOLE TIME.

33:20.125 --> 33:21.417
- YEAH, I WAS. YEAH.

33:21.417 --> 33:23.208
- IF THAT WERE TRUE,
THERE'D BE BLOOD HERE

33:23.208 --> 33:25.667
ON THE WALL,
AND THEN THE CEILING HERE.

33:25.667 --> 33:26.750
BUT THERE'S NO SPATTER HERE.

33:26.750 --> 33:28.709
- THAT'S BECAUSE
I CLEANED IT UP. NOW GO!

33:28.709 --> 33:32.208
- WITH BLEACH?
- YES.

33:32.208 --> 33:34.291
- NOT ON THIS WALL.

33:34.291 --> 33:36.000
BECAUSE THERE WAS NO BLOOD
ON THIS WALL,

33:36.000 --> 33:39.000
BECAUSE YOUR FATHER
WAS NEVER HERE.

33:39.000 --> 33:40.667
I KNOW FOR A FACT
THAT TRINITY

33:40.667 --> 33:44.125
DID NOT KILL ANYONE
IN THIS HOUSE.

33:51.500 --> 33:54.208
- WAS THAT BECAUSE
YOU KILLED HIM?

33:57.458 --> 34:00.208
- YES.

34:00.208 --> 34:03.625
JUST LIKE YOU KILLED
YOUR MOTHER AND YOUR SISTER.

34:08.709 --> 34:09.709
- GET HIM.

34:09.709 --> 34:11.709
[car starts]

34:15.208 --> 34:17.250
[tires screech]

34:27.542 --> 34:29.250
SATISFIED?

34:29.250 --> 34:31.375
- LET'S GO SET UP
THE KILL ROOM.

34:31.375 --> 34:33.709
- THAT'S MY BABY BROTHER.
[engine turns]

34:33.709 --> 34:35.709
WHAT ABOUT YOUR KNIVES,
DEXTER?

34:35.709 --> 34:38.041
YOU'RE GONNA NEED THEM.

34:55.875 --> 34:58.375
- PSST.

35:00.083 --> 35:03.041
HE'S IN THE SHED.

35:10.917 --> 35:13.959
- HEY, THERE.

35:13.959 --> 35:17.208
YOU'RE REAL INTERESTING,
FLORIDA, YOU KNOW THAT?

35:17.208 --> 35:19.917
ALL THESE POTIONS
AND SOLUTIONS

35:19.917 --> 35:21.834
IN THIS KIT
I FOUND IN YOUR CAR.

35:21.834 --> 35:24.667
AND THESE KNIVES OF YOURS.

35:24.667 --> 35:27.542
THEY AIN'T EXACTLY
LANDSCAPING TOOLS NOW, ARE THEY?

35:29.667 --> 35:31.333
- I'D LIKE THEM BACK.

35:31.333 --> 35:33.709
- I KNOW YOU SAW WHAT I WAS
GROWING OUT THERE

35:33.709 --> 35:34.750
IN THAT CORNFIELD.

35:34.750 --> 35:36.208
YOU KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON.

35:36.208 --> 35:37.959
- I DON'T CARE ABOUT THAT.
- REALLY?

35:37.959 --> 35:40.709
THEN WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

35:40.709 --> 35:43.083
YOU OBVIOUSLY HAVE
SOME SORT OF DESK JOB.

35:43.083 --> 35:44.291
THOSE HANDS OF YOURS
ARE SO SMOOTH.

35:44.291 --> 35:48.417
YOU WITH THE DEA,
ATF, FBI?

35:48.417 --> 35:50.041
- WHY DON'T YOU PUT
THE KNIFE DOWN AND WE CAN TALK.

35:50.041 --> 35:51.542
- WHAT ARE THEY WORTH
TO YOU?

35:51.542 --> 35:56.083
I CAN SEE YOU HAVE SOME MONEY
BY THAT FANCY CAR OF YOURS.

35:56.083 --> 35:57.291
- IT'S A RENTAL.

35:57.291 --> 35:59.875
- THIS IS NOT HOW I WAS HOPING
OUR FIRST KILL WOULD BE.

35:59.875 --> 36:02.000
- I SHOULD THINK KNIVES
LIKE THOSE OF YOURS

36:02.000 --> 36:06.875
WOULD BE WORTH $10,000
TO YOU.

36:06.875 --> 36:08.750
- THIS GUY IS LEAVING YOU
NO CHOICE.

36:08.750 --> 36:10.834
HE'S GONNA KILL YOU
IF YOU DON'T KILL HIM FIRST.

36:10.834 --> 36:13.291
- SO I PAY YOU $10,000,
YOU FORGET YOU EVER SAW ME?

36:13.291 --> 36:14.792
- YOU CAN HAVE
YOUR KNIVES BACK.

36:14.792 --> 36:18.500
- I'LL GO FIND AN ATM,
BUT I'M TAKING THESE WITH ME.

36:18.500 --> 36:21.333
- I FOUND THIS
IN THE CAR TOO.

36:21.333 --> 36:23.667
$10,000.

36:23.667 --> 36:26.000
PLEASE AND THANK YOU.

36:26.000 --> 36:28.291
OR YOU'RE A DEAD MAN.

36:53.125 --> 36:56.166
- AT LAST...A KILL!

36:56.166 --> 36:59.834
NO LENGTHY VETTING PROCESS,
NO STALKING.

36:59.834 --> 37:01.625
ONE CAN ARGUE
SELF-DEFENSE, MAYBE.

37:01.625 --> 37:03.750
A LITTLE TOO MUCH TALKING
FOR MY TASTE.

37:03.750 --> 37:05.625
DID YOU SEE HIS EYES?

37:05.625 --> 37:08.458
- YES.

37:08.458 --> 37:10.333
- WHY DO YOU WAKE UP
YOUR VICTIMS

37:10.333 --> 37:12.542
WHEN THEY'RE ON THE TABLE?

37:12.542 --> 37:14.709
- I WANT THEM TO KNOW
WHAT THEY'VE DONE.

37:14.709 --> 37:16.709
- BULLSHIT!

37:16.709 --> 37:20.125
YOU LIKE TO WATCH THE LIGHT
GO OUT OF THEIR EYES.

37:20.125 --> 37:24.000
DOESN'T MAKE A BIT OF DIFFERENCE
IF THEY'RE GUILTY OR NOT.

37:25.750 --> 37:30.041
HOW DO YOU FEEL?

37:30.041 --> 37:33.667
- LIKE ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE.

37:33.667 --> 37:36.834
- THIS IS THE LIFE
I'VE ALWAYS WANTED FOR YOU.

37:36.834 --> 37:39.083
- [exhales]

37:39.083 --> 37:41.917
- WHERE DO WE GO FROM HERE?

37:41.917 --> 37:43.375
- JONAH.

37:43.375 --> 37:46.125
- AND THEN WHAT, DEXTER?

37:46.125 --> 37:50.625
- AND THEN...

37:50.625 --> 37:52.375
WE KEEP GOING.

37:55.000 --> 37:57.250
BUT FIRST THINGS FIRST.

37:58.834 --> 38:00.250
HOW DO YOU DISPOSE
OF A BODY

38:00.250 --> 38:01.417
WHEN YOU'RE MILES
FROM THE OCEAN?

38:01.417 --> 38:04.417
- NORM'S A THIEF,
A POT-GROWER, AND AN ASSHOLE--

38:04.417 --> 38:06.583
ANY ONE OF WHICH WOULD
EXPLAIN HIS DEATH.

38:06.583 --> 38:09.375
YOU CAN JUST LEAVE HIS BODY
OUT IN THE OPEN.

38:13.000 --> 38:15.417
- I HAVE A BETTER IDEA.

38:15.417 --> 38:17.417
[hinges squeaks]

38:25.834 --> 38:28.417
- I HOPE YOU TOOK
A SOUVENIR.

39:18.125 --> 39:24.166
- IT'S NICE TO SEE YOU, TRAVIS.
I THOUGHT YOU WERE DONE WITH ME.

39:24.166 --> 39:25.458
- THESE ARE YOUR THINGS.

39:25.458 --> 39:30.917
I WANTED THEM OUT
OF MY APARTMENT.

39:30.917 --> 39:32.625
- WOULD HAVE BEEN
A LITTLE BIT EASIER

39:32.625 --> 39:36.709
IF YOU'D JUST DUMPED 'EM
IN THE TRASH, WOULDN'T IT?

39:36.709 --> 39:40.333
- I THOUGHT BRINGING THEM HERE
WOULD GIVE ME CLOSURE.

39:43.208 --> 39:45.458
- CLOSURE.

39:45.458 --> 39:47.458
SOUNDS LIKE YOU WENT
FROM READING THE BIBLE

39:47.458 --> 39:49.000
TO READING
THE SELF-HELP BOOKS.

39:49.000 --> 39:51.291
BUT IF YOU REALLY CAME HERE
BECAUSE

39:51.291 --> 39:53.333
YOU SECRETLY WANTED ME
TO BEG,

39:53.333 --> 39:58.041
WELL, THEN, PLEASE, TRAVIS,
COME BACK TO ME.

39:58.041 --> 39:59.834
- I DIDN'T COME HERE
TO HAVE YOU BEG.

39:59.834 --> 40:02.542
- HOW 'BOUT A STORY, THEN?

40:02.542 --> 40:04.333
I READ ONE THE OTHER DAY
IN THE PAPER

40:04.333 --> 40:07.041
ABOUT A LITTLE GIRL
IN CALIFORNIA WHO WAS ABDUCTED.

40:07.041 --> 40:09.375
THEY WENT INTO HER ROOM,
AND THEY GRABBED HER

40:09.375 --> 40:11.458
WHILE SHE WAS ASLEEP
NEXT TO HER TEDDY BEAR.

40:11.458 --> 40:13.125
THEY RAPED HER
AND THEN THEY KILLED HER,

40:13.125 --> 40:14.500
AND THEN THEY DUMPED HER
INTO THE WOODS.

40:14.500 --> 40:16.458
- DON'T TELL ME--
- THERE WAS ANOTHER STORY

40:16.458 --> 40:20.291
ABOUT SOMEONE WHO SET OFF A BOMB
IN PENNSYLVANIA.

40:20.291 --> 40:25.458
11 PEOPLE WERE KILLED,
20 MAIMED.

40:25.458 --> 40:29.959
THAT'S WHY THE WORLD,
AS IT IS, HAS TO END.

40:29.959 --> 40:31.291
- STOP TALKING.

40:31.291 --> 40:34.083
- THE SINS OF HUMANKIND
CONTINUE

40:34.083 --> 40:36.000
UNLESS WE PUT A STOP TO IT.

40:36.000 --> 40:38.041
- NO, NO, SHUT UP.
JUST SHUT UP!

40:38.041 --> 40:40.917
- ARE YOU GONNA KILL ME?

40:40.917 --> 40:43.542
IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT
TO DO, TRAVIS?

40:46.875 --> 40:52.834
- WHAT I WANT...

40:52.834 --> 40:55.542
IS TO BE FREE.

41:04.083 --> 41:05.542
- I'LL TALK TO GOD.

41:05.542 --> 41:09.333
I RELEASE YOU.

41:09.333 --> 41:12.083
- I CAN GO?

41:12.083 --> 41:14.625
- YOU KNOW WHERE
THE DOOR IS.

41:26.291 --> 41:29.458
- [recording]
YOU HAVE NO MESSAGES.

41:32.583 --> 41:34.917
- YOU'RE LOOMING.

41:38.333 --> 41:43.041
- I, UH, CAME
TO APOLOGIZE.

41:43.041 --> 41:46.500
I APOLOGIZE FOR BEING
AN ASSHOLE AT YOUR PARTY.

41:46.500 --> 41:50.417
AND FOR SLEEPING
WITH THAT PROFESSOR CHICK.

41:50.417 --> 41:55.208
AND I APOLOGIZE
FOR PROPOSING TO YOU.

41:55.208 --> 41:58.834
I JUST THOUGHT IT WAS SOMETHING
PEOPLE DID AFTER A WHILE,

41:58.834 --> 42:00.792
YOU KNOW?

42:00.792 --> 42:04.625
LIKE BUYING A COFFEE TABLE.

42:04.625 --> 42:06.917
- WE NEVER BOUGHT
A COFFEE TABLE.

42:06.917 --> 42:08.166
- WELL, WE TALKED ABOUT IT.

42:08.166 --> 42:11.041
- AND WE COULDN'T TALK
ABOUT GETTING MARRIED?

42:11.041 --> 42:14.000
- WE DID HAVE
SOMETHING GOOD, RIGHT?

42:14.000 --> 42:17.041
I MEAN, I'M NOT CRAZY,
AM I?

42:17.041 --> 42:19.375
- YEAH.

42:20.667 --> 42:23.792
WE HAD SOMETHING GOOD.

42:26.709 --> 42:28.542
- YOU KNOW, THERE'S TIMES
WHEN I COME HOME,

42:28.542 --> 42:31.041
AND I STILL EXPECT
TO SEE YOU THERE.

42:31.041 --> 42:34.834
AND--AND I OPEN UP THE DOOR,

42:34.834 --> 42:36.917
AND EVERYTHING'S
SO NEAT AND CLEAN.

42:36.917 --> 42:38.083
- [laughs]

42:38.083 --> 42:40.500
- AND IT HITS ME
ALL OVER AGAIN.

42:42.208 --> 42:43.583
YOU'RE GONE.

42:49.041 --> 42:52.375
- I'M RIGHT HERE.
- YEAH.

42:52.375 --> 42:54.500
IN LAGUERTA'S OFFICE.

42:54.500 --> 42:56.667
- FUCK, I KNOW, RIGHT?

42:56.667 --> 42:58.542
IT STILL FEELS
LIKE HER OFFICE.

42:58.542 --> 43:00.625
I THINK THAT'S WHY
I HAVEN'T UNPACKED ANYTHING.

43:00.625 --> 43:02.166
AT ALL.

43:02.166 --> 43:03.709
- YEAH.

43:07.041 --> 43:11.125
- I WANTED TO TELL YOU FIRST
ABOUT THIS BEFORE ANYONE.

43:11.125 --> 43:13.250
- I MADE THAT DIFFICULT.

43:13.250 --> 43:16.417
- YEAH, BUT...

43:16.417 --> 43:18.625
YOU WERE HURT.

43:18.625 --> 43:21.583
BECAUSE OF ME.

43:21.583 --> 43:24.250
AND FOR THAT
I AM TRULY SORRY.

43:26.208 --> 43:28.125
- I REALLY MISS YOU, DEB.

43:30.458 --> 43:33.834
YOU, LIKE, KEPT ME GLUED
OR SOMETHING.

43:33.834 --> 43:35.709
- SOMETIMES I DON'T KNOW
WHAT I'M DOING.

43:35.709 --> 43:37.750
I FEEL LIKE THE LAST DAY
MY LIFE MADE ANY SENSE

43:37.750 --> 43:39.875
WAS THE LAST DAY
I SPENT WITH YOU.

43:59.333 --> 44:01.166
WE CAN'T.

44:07.667 --> 44:10.291
- WE'RE OVER, AREN'T WE?

44:10.291 --> 44:12.750
LIKE OVER  OVER.

44:34.542 --> 44:38.417
- THIS IS WHAT OUR LIFE TOGETHER
COULD HAVE BEEN LIKE

44:38.417 --> 44:40.166
IF YOU HADN'T KILLED ME.

44:40.166 --> 44:43.834
[cell phone rings]

44:43.834 --> 44:45.583
- HERE'S THE CALL.
- JONAH.

44:45.583 --> 44:47.792
- HELLO?

44:47.792 --> 44:50.333
- DEXTER, CAN WE TALK
ABOUT THIS?

44:50.333 --> 44:51.750
- SURE, JONAH.

44:51.750 --> 44:54.291
- MAYBE SOMEWHERE PRIVATE.

44:54.291 --> 44:55.709
I WAS THINKING
THE SHOP'S CLOSED...

44:55.709 --> 44:56.959
- I'LL MEET YOU THERE.

44:56.959 --> 44:59.875
- JONAH DOESN'T WANT
TO CHITCHAT.

44:59.875 --> 45:01.250
- I KNOW.

45:01.250 --> 45:03.291
HE HAS EVERY REASON
TO WANT TO KILL ME.

45:03.291 --> 45:04.834
I'M THE ONE PERSON
WHO KNOWS WHAT HE DID.

45:04.834 --> 45:10.208
- DON'T YOU JUST LOVE IT
WHEN THINGS FALL INTO PLACE?

45:41.208 --> 45:42.333
[[door shuts]

45:47.083 --> 45:48.959
- YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE COME
TO NEBRASKA.

45:48.959 --> 45:50.667
- I HAD TO.
I COULDN'T BELIEVE IT.

45:50.667 --> 45:52.166
- BELIEVE WHAT,
THAT I TURNED INTO A KILLER

45:52.166 --> 45:53.542
LIKE MY FATHER?

45:53.542 --> 45:56.083
- YES.
I THOUGHT I SET YOU FREE.

45:56.083 --> 45:57.917
SET YOUR WHOLE FAMILY FREE.

45:57.917 --> 46:01.250
- I WANTED TO KILL HIM
MYSELF.

46:01.250 --> 46:04.375
- BUT YOU'LL SETTLE FOR KILLING
YOUR MOM AND YOUR SISTER?

46:04.375 --> 46:06.125
- YEAH, AND YOU.

46:10.583 --> 46:12.417
- DO IT, DEXTER! DO IT!

46:14.291 --> 46:18.417
- KILL ME!

46:18.417 --> 46:19.709
- WHAT DID YOU SAY?

46:19.709 --> 46:22.250
- PLEASE.

46:22.250 --> 46:24.709
- YOU WANT ME TO KILL YOU?

46:24.709 --> 46:26.166
- WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?

46:26.166 --> 46:28.125
- KILL ME FOR WHAT I DID.

46:33.542 --> 46:34.834
- TELL ME WHAT HAPPENED.

46:34.834 --> 46:36.208
- WHO CARES WHAT HAPPENED?

46:36.208 --> 46:39.625
- I DIDN'T KILL REBECCA.

46:39.625 --> 46:41.667
SHE KILLED HERSELF.

46:41.667 --> 46:45.458
I FOUND HER LIKE THAT
IN THE TUB, MY BABY SISTER.

46:45.458 --> 46:49.208
GOD, I SHOULD HAVE GOTTEN HER
OUT OF THAT HOUSE SOONER.

46:49.208 --> 46:50.458
SHE COULDN'T TAKE IT
ANYMORE.

46:50.458 --> 46:53.417
- TAKE WHAT?
- DEXTER...

46:53.417 --> 46:55.917
- MY MOM.

46:55.917 --> 47:00.917
HOW SHE BLAMED US
FOR EVERYTHING HE DID.

47:00.917 --> 47:02.959
SHE JUST--
SHE WAS STILL IN LOVE WITH HIM.

47:02.959 --> 47:04.500
SHE KEPT DEFENDING HIM.

47:04.500 --> 47:08.458
SHE JUST WISHED HE WOULD COME
AND WHISK HER AWAY

47:08.458 --> 47:11.250
TO THAILAND OR MEXICO.

47:11.250 --> 47:14.625
THEN I FOUND BECCA.

47:14.625 --> 47:17.083
AND I JUST EXPLODED ON MOM.

47:17.083 --> 47:22.166
I KEPT HITTING HER
OVER AND OVER, JUST LIKE DAD!

47:22.166 --> 47:24.041
I'M MY FATHER'S SON!

47:24.041 --> 47:26.458
- TIME TO PUT HIM DOWN,
DEXTER.

47:33.333 --> 47:36.375
- YOU BROUGHT ME HERE
TO PROVOKE A FIGHT,

47:36.375 --> 47:37.667
HOPING I WOULD KILL YOU.

47:37.667 --> 47:41.333
- DEATH BY DEXTER.
FANTASTIC IDEA!

47:41.333 --> 47:42.458
KILL HIM!

47:47.792 --> 47:49.542
- WHAT IF THIS WERE MY SON?

47:49.542 --> 47:51.500
- WE HAVE COME SO FAR.

47:51.500 --> 47:53.000
- HE'S NOT A MONSTER.

47:53.000 --> 47:55.208
- DON'T YOU WANT TO SEE
THE LIGHT IN HIS EYES GO OUT?

47:55.208 --> 47:58.166
- NO.

47:58.166 --> 48:01.709
- THINK HOW GOOD IT WILL FEEL.
- HE HAS A CONSCIENCE...

48:01.709 --> 48:03.208
AND REGRET.

48:03.208 --> 48:08.000
- THIS IS THE WISHY-WASHY PART
OF YOU I CAN'T STAND.

48:08.000 --> 48:11.083
- UH, OH, BINEY'S MAD.

48:14.333 --> 48:16.458
- THIS IS LIKE DEBRA
ALL OVER AGAIN.

48:16.458 --> 48:18.333
YOU'RE WEAK.

48:21.959 --> 48:26.500
- I'M STRONGER THAN YOU.

48:26.500 --> 48:28.500
- WE HAD A PLAN, DEXTER.

48:28.500 --> 48:29.542
JUST YOU AND ME.

48:29.542 --> 48:31.917
- I'M GOING HOME.

48:38.542 --> 48:40.500
- BABY BROTHER.

48:40.500 --> 48:42.333
- WAIT!

48:42.333 --> 48:45.250
HOW AM I SUPPOSED
TO LIVE WITH THIS?

48:48.458 --> 48:50.291
- FORGIVE YOURSELF.

48:59.917 --> 49:01.917
- HAVE YOU BEEN A GOOD GIRL,
DEBRA MORGAN?

49:01.917 --> 49:04.291
BECAUSE IT'S ABOUT
TO BE CHRISTMAS.

49:04.291 --> 49:06.083
SHOW HER, LOUIS.

49:06.083 --> 49:08.417
- I CREATED A PROGRAM
THAT CROSS-REFERENCED

49:08.417 --> 49:10.375
FORMER STUDENTS OF GELLAR
WITH PEOPLE LIVING

49:10.375 --> 49:11.917
IN A 20-MILE RADIUS OF MIAMI.

49:11.917 --> 49:14.417
I EXCLUDED A FEW VARIABLES...
- AND PRESTO!

49:14.417 --> 49:16.125
200 NAMES.
- IT WAS THAT EASY?

49:16.125 --> 49:19.208
- BUT NOT ALL THAT LEGAL.
- EH, NOT A PROBLEMO.

49:19.208 --> 49:21.458
LOUIS GREENE IS NOT
AN EMPLOYEE OF MIAMI METRO,

49:21.458 --> 49:24.375
JUST AN UNPAID INTERN.

49:24.375 --> 49:26.417
- THANK YOU...

49:26.417 --> 49:28.125
I THINK.

49:28.125 --> 49:30.959
- HERE TO SERVE.

49:37.333 --> 49:40.917
- IF YOU WANT A RIDE TO WORK,
I'M LEAVING IN SEVEN MINUTES.

49:40.917 --> 49:43.458
- NOT SIX?
- NOT EIGHT.

49:44.917 --> 49:46.834
- I'LL BE READY.

50:08.000 --> 50:12.375
- BROTHER SAM BELIEVED
LIGHT CAN KEEP DARKNESS AT BAY.

50:12.375 --> 50:15.709
BUT I WONDER IF DARKNESS
IS DEFINED BY LIGHT.

50:15.709 --> 50:19.333
IF SO, DARKNESS CAN'T EXIST
ON ITS OWN.

50:21.291 --> 50:26.667
THERE MUST, BY DEFINITION,
BE LIGHT SOMEWHERE,

50:26.667 --> 50:28.709
WAITING TO BE FOUND.

50:37.500 --> 50:40.125
- WELCOME HOME, SON.
