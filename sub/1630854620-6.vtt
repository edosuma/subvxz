That's it!
Dance me how you're feeling.

00:39.646 --> 00:40.748
This is stupid!

00:40.915 --> 00:43.253
If I'm gonna grind on a couch
in the middle of the night,

00:43.253 --> 00:45.658
I'd like to be
with a different group!

00:45.658 --> 00:47.428
And a different couch, frankly.

00:47.428 --> 00:50.334
Beautiful, Elsa.
And your mood is?

00:50.334 --> 00:53.006
Uh, angry, resentful,
a little bit--

00:53.006 --> 00:54.408
No, no, no,
say it with dance.

00:54.408 --> 00:58.383
Diablo, feel the music.

00:58.383 --> 00:59.318
I know.

00:59.318 --> 01:00.755
I'm sorry for scheduling
a night session,

01:00.755 --> 01:02.491
but Jill finally
left the house.

01:02.491 --> 01:04.195
She took a bunch
of camping equipment

01:04.195 --> 01:06.834
and mentioned something
called cycle-delics,

01:06.834 --> 01:07.669
which I can only assume

01:07.769 --> 01:10.307
is the new white woman
form of exercise.

01:10.307 --> 01:12.311
Come on, Gray One.
Show me some moves.

01:12.311 --> 01:13.948
What is that?
You're just shrugging.

01:13.948 --> 01:15.818
Pretty much sums me up.

01:15.818 --> 01:18.891
One big, lonely,
"If I died tomorrow,

01:18.891 --> 01:20.929
nobody would miss me" shrug.

01:22.498 --> 01:24.803
Ah, the soundtrack
of my life.

01:24.803 --> 01:26.707
All right, everyone.
Take five.

01:26.707 --> 01:28.376
Thank God!

01:29.913 --> 01:31.517
And wake up!

01:31.517 --> 01:34.556
Do you have any idea
how challenging it is for me

01:34.556 --> 01:37.494
to discreetly gather
you whiny ding-dongs every week

01:37.494 --> 01:39.566
so that we can go unnoticed
by my human?

01:39.566 --> 01:42.271
Ooh!
Welcome to "Honey After Dark."

01:42.271 --> 01:44.175
I put my sweet ass
on the line

01:44.175 --> 01:45.845
so you can
get out your saddies.

01:45.845 --> 01:47.281
Have you considered
what would happen

01:47.281 --> 01:49.786
if Jill were to walk in on us
right now?

01:51.489 --> 01:52.926
Well, how crazy
would that have been

01:52.926 --> 01:54.095
if she had actually just--

01:55.598 --> 01:58.370
Run for your lives!

02:00.942 --> 02:03.146
This must be
some strong ayahuasca,

02:03.246 --> 02:04.716
because I swear I just saw

02:04.716 --> 02:08.791
a one-eyed cat and a sickly
mongoose tear outta here.

02:09.860 --> 02:11.195
I'd say sickly weasel,

02:11.195 --> 02:12.599
but close enough, sweet cheeks.

02:12.599 --> 02:13.534
Sweet cheeks?

02:13.534 --> 02:15.772
Let's take it down a notch,
"Mad Men."

02:15.772 --> 02:16.840
Oh, my God.

02:16.840 --> 02:18.143
You understood that?

02:24.388 --> 02:26.794
Huh?

02:27.862 --> 02:31.770
Uh-oh! Looks like
they got into the people-nip.

02:31.770 --> 02:35.010
- So you can talk!
- And you can understand me!

02:35.010 --> 02:36.012
both: Oh, my God!

02:36.012 --> 02:37.582
This is a miracle!
Jinx!

02:37.582 --> 02:38.884
- Buy me a Coke.
- Buy me a chew toy!

02:39.886 --> 02:41.289
Well, friends,

02:41.389 --> 02:43.661
I don't know how long
this ayahuasca will last,

02:43.661 --> 02:46.065
so go ahead and AMA.

02:46.065 --> 02:47.468
Jill, Jill, back to me.

02:47.468 --> 02:49.238
There's just so much
I want to say to you.

02:49.238 --> 02:50.742
And I can't wait to hear it.

02:50.742 --> 02:53.246
It's happening!
We're taking this relationship

02:53.246 --> 02:54.616
to the next level!

02:56.319 --> 02:58.657
both: On your left!

03:01.496 --> 03:04.268
Oh, Honey!
I have so much respect for you!

03:04.268 --> 03:06.072
I know!

03:08.611 --> 03:10.982
all: Jill! Jill!

03:10.982 --> 03:12.184
Ooh, who to pick?

03:12.184 --> 03:13.453
Um...

03:13.554 --> 03:15.223
not the writhing mass
of spiders.

03:15.223 --> 03:17.127
Yes, okay!

03:17.127 --> 03:19.533
The extra-sparkly Corgi.
- Thanks.

03:19.533 --> 03:22.271
So you mentioned earlier
that humans intentionally

03:22.271 --> 03:24.108
bred me to have
these stubby legs.

03:24.108 --> 03:25.611
My question is why?

03:25.611 --> 03:28.584
Well, the aristocracy found
your form to be beautiful.

03:28.584 --> 03:31.022
You hear that?
You can all get humped.

03:31.022 --> 03:34.663
In fact, it's likely you're
the most expensive animal here

03:34.663 --> 03:36.466
with the exception
of the slow loris,

03:36.466 --> 03:38.303
but he's illegal.

03:39.472 --> 03:41.175
I'm sorry. You're right.

03:41.175 --> 03:42.912
Undocumented. I'm sorry.

03:42.912 --> 03:44.014
- Jill, over here!
- Oh, Jill!

03:44.014 --> 03:46.352
I have a question for you.
- I have a question also.

03:46.352 --> 03:48.123
Yes, thick, orange cat!

03:48.123 --> 03:49.358
Chico, Kevin's house.

03:49.358 --> 03:50.460
Thank you for taking
my question.

03:50.460 --> 03:53.133
Why does my person watch
so many instructional videos

03:53.133 --> 03:54.569
about human mating?

03:54.569 --> 03:57.642
Oh, he's just fantasizing
about sexual scenarios

03:57.642 --> 04:00.681
he can't create on his own,
to which he'll masturbate

04:00.681 --> 04:03.186
and then fall asleep and dream
about his teeth falling out.

04:03.186 --> 04:04.188
Neat!

04:04.188 --> 04:05.390
Okay, guys.

04:05.390 --> 04:06.660
Jill's being polite,
but obviously,

04:06.660 --> 04:08.864
she only wants
to talk to me, so--

04:12.204 --> 04:13.373
Sacred plant medicine,

04:13.373 --> 04:14.442
am I right?

04:14.442 --> 04:16.145
That's it!
Everybody out.

04:18.483 --> 04:21.289
Sorry about that.
They can be a lot.

04:21.289 --> 04:23.928
They're great.
I love them.

04:23.928 --> 04:26.967
Especially the ones
that melted like ice cream.

04:26.967 --> 04:28.336
Well, I know
you've been dying

04:28.336 --> 04:30.006
to have some
one-on-one time with me

04:30.006 --> 04:33.446
and it's been my lifelong dream
to communicate with you, so--

04:33.446 --> 04:35.751
Honey, Honey!
You gotta get out there!

04:35.751 --> 04:37.454
You know that dream
I always have

04:37.555 --> 04:39.325
where the backyard
is covered in vomit

04:39.325 --> 04:41.262
and wild-eyed hippies
try to braid me?

04:41.262 --> 04:42.565
It's happening!

04:42.565 --> 04:44.235
Oh, when did Jill get back?

04:44.235 --> 04:46.472
- About 20 minutes ago.
- Oh.

04:46.472 --> 04:47.642
I must have missed you.

04:47.642 --> 04:50.313
Wowza!
You can understand me?

04:50.313 --> 04:52.017
- Every word.
- Cool!

04:52.017 --> 04:53.453
I have so many questions.

04:53.453 --> 04:56.092
Me, too!
Did you take my new sandals?

04:56.092 --> 04:59.465
The short answer is, yes.
The long answer is...

04:59.465 --> 05:01.402
Yes.

05:01.402 --> 05:02.371
Now my turn.

05:02.371 --> 05:03.641
Actually, it's my turn.

05:03.641 --> 05:05.110
What's your favorite color?

05:05.110 --> 05:06.547
And also, what is color?

05:06.547 --> 05:09.218
Imagine if light had flavor.

05:10.320 --> 05:12.759
It feels a little
"Walking Dead," doesn't it?

05:12.759 --> 05:16.032
I mean the early seasons
before it went off the rails.

05:16.032 --> 05:17.167
Let me catch my breath.

05:17.167 --> 05:18.136
I have tiny lungs

05:18.236 --> 05:20.173
and my seasonal allergies
got my nose all--

05:20.173 --> 05:22.077
Lord, I'm adorable!

05:22.077 --> 05:23.814
Neil?
Neil!

05:23.814 --> 05:26.620
Oh, I've spent so long
searching for you

05:26.620 --> 05:28.456
when the whole time,
all I had to do

05:28.456 --> 05:29.860
was get high out of my gourd!

05:29.860 --> 05:32.497
Whoa!
Ever heard of consent, lady?

05:32.497 --> 05:36.339
'Cause--
ooh, I am giving it!

05:36.339 --> 05:37.742
Neil, you came back to me

05:37.742 --> 05:41.282
in the body of a sad,
nondescript cat!

05:41.282 --> 05:43.019
Don't you recognize me?

05:43.019 --> 05:45.357
It's Diane, your wife!

05:45.357 --> 05:47.427
- Wife?
- Oh, sweetums!

05:47.427 --> 05:49.164
I've missed your touch.

05:50.433 --> 05:52.471
Too rough!

05:52.471 --> 05:54.341
What's our safe word?

05:54.341 --> 05:55.545
Gray One, I can't tell

05:55.645 --> 05:57.381
if you're loving this
or hating this.

05:57.381 --> 06:00.220
Blink twice if you need help
I can't provide.

06:00.220 --> 06:01.255
Oh, my God!
Yes, yes.

06:01.255 --> 06:02.659
Ooh, free hugs?
I'm next!

06:02.659 --> 06:04.696
They are free, right?

06:04.696 --> 06:06.900
Yeah, this lady thinks The
Gray One's her dead husband.

06:06.900 --> 06:09.506
Do you cool cats always have
this much fun?

06:09.506 --> 06:11.610
Usually I'm alone
with just my thoughts.

06:11.610 --> 06:13.213
Just your thoughts?

06:13.313 --> 06:15.283
Guys, don't be like that.

06:15.283 --> 06:17.889
Neil, darling!

06:17.889 --> 06:20.895
No, maybe this will
help jog your memory.

06:22.130 --> 06:23.499
Wait a minute.

06:23.499 --> 06:25.571
One eye, lots of chest hair,

06:25.571 --> 06:26.773
looks like he could've woken up

06:26.873 --> 06:28.611
in a pile of old
"Parade" magazines?

06:28.611 --> 06:31.415
I am Neil!

06:33.386 --> 06:34.488
Behold, my friends.

06:34.488 --> 06:35.691
My late husband

06:35.691 --> 06:39.098
and certified
public accountant,

06:39.098 --> 06:40.902
Neil Radabaugh!

06:43.874 --> 06:46.412
Yes! You manifested it!

06:46.513 --> 06:48.149
I hate LA.

06:49.118 --> 06:50.487
<i>And while we're
on the subject,</i>

06:50.487 --> 06:51.556
why do you wipe?

06:51.556 --> 06:53.459
Is it so no one can smell
what you're thinking?

06:53.459 --> 06:54.495
Seriously, Chief?

06:54.495 --> 06:56.399
We've been granted the miracle

06:56.399 --> 06:57.936
of communicating
with our human,

06:57.936 --> 06:59.706
and that's what
you want to know?

06:59.706 --> 07:02.244
I'm just easing into it with
some delightful small talk.

07:02.244 --> 07:05.216
Now Jill, tell me all about
when you gave birth to me.

07:05.216 --> 07:07.187
Was it painful?
Did you lick me clean?

07:07.187 --> 07:08.991
Did you cut
my umbrella-cul cord?

07:08.991 --> 07:12.364
Sweetie, I didn't
give birth to you.

07:12.364 --> 07:14.101
But you're my mommy.

07:14.101 --> 07:15.370
I have your hips!

07:15.370 --> 07:18.209
Baby, I adopted you.

07:18.209 --> 07:19.546
What?

07:19.646 --> 07:21.415
Did you know?
- Yes.

07:21.415 --> 07:23.019
Remember that time Jill told us

07:23.019 --> 07:25.891
she found you as a puppy
behind a feminist strip club?

07:25.891 --> 07:28.296
I thought that was just
a story she made up

07:28.296 --> 07:30.801
because I was too young
to know about sex!

07:30.801 --> 07:33.741
But I hope you know
that I'm still your mommy.

07:33.741 --> 07:35.611
I don't know anything
anymore!

07:35.611 --> 07:37.481
My whole life is a lie!

07:37.481 --> 07:39.953
Am I even really a good boy?

07:39.953 --> 07:40.921
When he's like this,

07:40.921 --> 07:43.092
it's best to give him
some time alone.

07:43.092 --> 07:45.598
Let's go find an H&M
and get matching crop tops--

07:45.598 --> 07:46.833
and leg warmers!

07:46.833 --> 07:48.570
You need to take me
to that strip club

07:48.570 --> 07:50.541
to find my real mommy.

07:50.541 --> 07:52.712
Chief, we're not going
to a strip club

07:52.812 --> 07:54.516
in the middle of the night
to find a dog

07:54.516 --> 07:56.452
that's probably been dead
for years.

07:56.452 --> 07:59.258
Please!
It will give me closure!

07:59.258 --> 08:01.228
Okay, let's go.

08:01.228 --> 08:02.464
What? Seriously?

08:02.464 --> 08:04.769
You heard him.
It'll give him closure.

08:04.769 --> 08:06.606
Okay, I just
taught him that word last week,

08:06.606 --> 08:08.409
and he's constantly
misusing it.

08:08.409 --> 08:09.713
Honey, please.

08:09.713 --> 08:12.952
You're being very closure
right now.

08:15.123 --> 08:17.962
We've got to save him from
that delusional, basic widow.

08:17.962 --> 08:20.668
We?
Okay, just to be clear,

08:20.668 --> 08:22.605
the best friend position
is filled.

08:22.605 --> 08:24.308
You're just a dog
he knows from group.

08:24.308 --> 08:26.445
Aw, you really think
I look like a dog?

08:26.445 --> 08:29.184
Let's get outta here, lover.

08:29.184 --> 08:31.455
Gray One!
It's a cat-napping!

08:31.455 --> 08:33.426
That sounds cuter
than it should!

08:35.363 --> 08:37.334
Scoot!

08:37.334 --> 08:38.604
I'm in no condition to drive,

08:38.604 --> 08:40.508
so, Honey, take the wheel!

08:40.508 --> 08:42.177
I can't drive.

08:42.177 --> 08:42.912
Or can I?

08:42.912 --> 08:45.383
Chief, you work the pedals.

08:45.383 --> 08:46.720
Hey, pedals.

08:46.720 --> 08:48.924
Do those ridges go
all the way up?

08:48.924 --> 08:51.462
Now I'm going to put the car
in reverse.

08:51.563 --> 08:52.732
Yay!
I know what to do!

08:52.732 --> 08:55.871
And Chief, you're gonna want
to gently press that pedal.

08:57.174 --> 08:59.211
Doing great.

09:00.447 --> 09:01.917
Excellent.

09:01.917 --> 09:05.256
Now, Honey, you see that little
lever to the left of the wheel?

09:05.256 --> 09:06.827
Give her a pull.

09:07.862 --> 09:09.498
Good girl!

09:09.498 --> 09:11.202
Are we there yet?

09:15.644 --> 09:18.249
Now isn't this better
than driving?

09:18.249 --> 09:19.251
It's certainly slower.

09:19.418 --> 09:21.823
Let's just get to that
strip club, disappoint Chief,

09:21.823 --> 09:23.694
go home,
and have a real gals' night.

09:23.694 --> 09:26.298
Why not start
that gals' night now?

09:26.298 --> 09:27.635
Yay! Paint my nails!

09:27.635 --> 09:28.871
Get away from my nails!

09:28.871 --> 09:30.941
Make them pretty!
Don't you dare touch them!

09:30.941 --> 09:33.413
Sorry, unresolved puppy issues.

09:33.413 --> 09:36.820
So you're kind of a little
therapist yourself, aren't you?

09:36.820 --> 09:38.824
I mean,
I'm more than kind of, but--

09:38.824 --> 09:40.995
Do you think
my real mom has missed me?

09:40.995 --> 09:45.003
Well, Chief, I like to think
of myself as your real mom.

09:45.003 --> 09:46.873
Tomato, adopted.

09:46.873 --> 09:50.280
I had no idea this would be
so traumatic for him.

09:50.280 --> 09:53.754
Well, one of the tenets of
my very real therapy practice

09:53.754 --> 09:56.459
is to reframe trauma
as the furnace

09:56.459 --> 09:58.296
in which our values are forged.

09:58.296 --> 09:59.599
Oh, wow.

09:59.599 --> 10:01.135
Would you ever want
to collaborate

10:01.135 --> 10:02.204
on a peer-reviewed paper?

10:02.304 --> 10:04.441
Your name would go first
because you're the human.

10:04.441 --> 10:05.443
I have to pee.

10:05.443 --> 10:06.580
So pee!

10:06.580 --> 10:07.949
I have to pee, too!

10:07.949 --> 10:09.451
You be lookout.

10:12.390 --> 10:14.696
Ooh, this feels so liberating!

10:14.696 --> 10:17.568
I may never use
a bathroom again!

10:17.568 --> 10:18.670
Hey!

10:18.670 --> 10:19.906
Dr. Jill?

10:19.906 --> 10:21.175
Uh, woof?

10:21.175 --> 10:22.377
Run!

10:22.979 --> 10:25.518
Okay, I think it's this way.

10:25.518 --> 10:26.686
No. This way?

10:26.686 --> 10:28.289
Look, I hate to be that cat,

10:28.289 --> 10:30.260
but your value
to the organization right now

10:30.260 --> 10:33.399
is directly linked to
your ability to smell things.

10:33.399 --> 10:34.401
It's not being cute?

10:34.536 --> 10:37.374
I am an obese cat.
I think we've got that covered.

10:37.374 --> 10:39.979
I'm sorry, there's just more
pollen in the air than usual

10:39.979 --> 10:41.583
on account of climate change.

10:41.583 --> 10:42.852
I miss The Gray One.

10:42.852 --> 10:44.823
He's never informed enough
to talk politics.

10:44.823 --> 10:46.560
Well, it's not really
a political--

10:46.560 --> 10:48.964
Found him!

10:50.333 --> 10:52.605
Oh, my God!

10:52.605 --> 10:54.408
He's dead!

10:54.408 --> 10:57.915
No!
No!

10:57.915 --> 11:00.019
It looks like the organization
has an opening.

11:00.019 --> 11:01.623
Welcome aboard.

11:01.623 --> 11:04.796
No!

11:06.465 --> 11:08.169
I want the whole
canine experience.

11:08.169 --> 11:09.739
What should we do next?
Chase cars?

11:09.739 --> 11:10.841
Freak out at the blood moon?

11:10.841 --> 11:12.578
Sit and stare at the door?

11:12.578 --> 11:14.616
Or we could each say

11:14.616 --> 11:16.452
what we admire most
about each other.

11:16.452 --> 11:17.287
I'll go first.

11:17.454 --> 11:20.694
I admire your resilience,
your curiosity,

11:20.694 --> 11:22.464
your quiet dignity--

11:22.464 --> 11:23.901
Jill?

11:24.001 --> 11:25.169
Whee!

11:25.169 --> 11:28.309
I totally understand
why you guys love this.

11:28.309 --> 11:30.213
I want this stank all over me!

11:30.213 --> 11:33.019
Can we just get this walk
over with and go home?

11:33.019 --> 11:35.323
Hey, can I ask you
a question?

11:35.323 --> 11:36.693
Yes!
Finally!

11:36.693 --> 11:38.462
Can I wear your collar?

11:38.564 --> 11:39.231
Sure.

11:39.364 --> 11:43.807
Squirrel!

11:45.511 --> 11:47.347
Oh, Gray One!

11:47.347 --> 11:50.019
I will avenge you!

11:50.119 --> 11:51.523
Hey, guys.

11:51.523 --> 11:53.727
What are you doing here?
- You're not dead!

11:53.727 --> 11:55.831
No, I--I just passed out.

11:55.831 --> 11:59.104
Huh, I guess this
is what a food coma is.

11:59.104 --> 12:01.576
I've never been full
enough to be in one before!

12:01.576 --> 12:04.214
Let's get out of here before
that crazy lady comes back.

12:04.214 --> 12:07.487
Hey! That crazy lady
is my crazy <i>wife.</i>

12:07.487 --> 12:11.763
And because of her, I'm so much
more than just The Gray One.

12:11.763 --> 12:13.934
I'm a dead CPA husband.

12:13.934 --> 12:15.604
A whiz with numbers,

12:15.604 --> 12:17.909
an unironic fan of Mario Lopez,

12:17.909 --> 12:20.446
and a verbal, submissive top.

12:20.446 --> 12:21.315
Neil!

12:21.415 --> 12:23.219
She's never liked
any of my friends.

12:23.219 --> 12:24.087
Hide!

12:24.087 --> 12:25.658
Oh, my God, I lost my locket.

12:25.658 --> 12:27.027
You have to help me find it!

12:27.027 --> 12:28.764
You're so good
at finding things.

12:28.764 --> 12:30.199
It's like you always say,

12:30.199 --> 12:32.805
I'm such a useless
scatterbrain!

12:32.805 --> 12:35.678
Looks like my lady needs
a booster shot

12:35.678 --> 12:37.682
of the Neil vaccine.

12:37.682 --> 12:39.117
Mmm.

12:39.117 --> 12:40.988
Aw, you're so--
wait a minute.

12:40.988 --> 12:43.025
Neil would never forgive me
so quickly.

12:43.025 --> 12:45.063
He'd lord it over me for years

12:45.063 --> 12:46.933
and then talk about it
on his podcast.

12:46.933 --> 12:49.071
Which means--
and this could just be

12:49.071 --> 12:50.741
the no-more-drugs talking--

12:50.741 --> 12:52.143
you're not Neil!

12:52.143 --> 12:55.884
You're just some cat
I bathed with!

12:55.884 --> 12:57.153
You didn't tell us
about that part.

12:57.153 --> 13:00.026
I--I guess I was saving it
for my podcast?

13:00.026 --> 13:02.632
Get out!

13:11.181 --> 13:12.918
Chief, we've sniffed everywhere.

13:12.918 --> 13:14.689
Your real mom's just not here.

13:14.689 --> 13:16.191
Wait!

13:16.191 --> 13:18.162
I think I smell something.
- Really?

13:18.262 --> 13:19.599
Is this dog?

13:19.599 --> 13:20.668
Oh!

13:21.770 --> 13:23.072
No.

13:23.072 --> 13:25.644
That's just the smell
of a recent murder.

13:25.644 --> 13:26.813
I'm sorry.

13:26.913 --> 13:28.784
I guess I have no mommy.

13:33.225 --> 13:36.065
Well, that's a real kick
in the V.

13:36.065 --> 13:38.870
So I guess I'm just some rando
who rubs his belly,

13:38.870 --> 13:40.741
pays too much
for pet health insurance,

13:40.741 --> 13:43.279
and makes every password
"Chief69."

13:43.379 --> 13:45.851
Oh, my God!
This isn't about you!

13:45.851 --> 13:46.920
Excuse me?

13:46.920 --> 13:48.055
Well, first you set him up

13:48.055 --> 13:49.391
for certain heartbreak.

13:49.391 --> 13:51.061
Then you have the audacity

13:51.061 --> 13:52.732
to make yourself the victim?

13:53.834 --> 13:55.871
You are being
so judgy right now!

13:55.871 --> 13:57.608
Well, I wouldn't
have to be judgy

13:57.608 --> 13:59.244
if you'd just be the adult!

13:59.244 --> 14:02.250
You're a dog, sweetheart.

14:02.250 --> 14:04.522
Wow, you had that one
locked and loaded.

14:04.522 --> 14:07.293
You know, I always thought
that you were the one person

14:07.293 --> 14:09.999
who would understand me if only
you could understand me,

14:09.999 --> 14:11.335
but now that you can
understand me,

14:11.335 --> 14:14.341
it's clear you don't
understand me at all!

14:15.176 --> 14:17.113
- Huh?
- I need to find Chief,

14:17.113 --> 14:20.019
and you need to stop being
such a big baby lady!

14:20.019 --> 14:21.021
I'll be right back.

14:21.021 --> 14:22.190
Stay.
- Uh--

14:22.190 --> 14:23.459
Stay!

14:25.463 --> 14:27.735
Another empowering night
in the books.

14:27.735 --> 14:29.872
This ayahuasca is amazing!

14:29.872 --> 14:31.976
I can understand strippers too!

14:31.976 --> 14:33.847
I have an idea!

14:33.847 --> 14:36.285
Hi!
Hi, hi, hi.

14:36.285 --> 14:37.454
Sorry to bother you.

14:37.454 --> 14:39.792
Do you think you could do me
a tiny favor

14:39.792 --> 14:40.961
and tell my dog
you're his mother

14:40.961 --> 14:42.732
so I can go home and vomit?

14:42.732 --> 14:44.234
Sure, sure, yeah.

14:44.234 --> 14:45.838
Happy to help.

14:45.838 --> 14:47.240
This address current?

14:47.240 --> 14:48.877
Yep!

14:48.877 --> 14:51.215
Okay.
In you go.

14:53.152 --> 14:54.254
If it makes
you feel better...

14:54.254 --> 14:55.958
- Whee!
- I do know my birth mother,

14:55.958 --> 14:57.427
and she's a total nightmare.

14:57.427 --> 15:00.133
Blanche?
Honey, she's salt of the earth!

15:00.133 --> 15:03.072
Wait, where's Jill?
Jill! Jill!

15:03.072 --> 15:05.844
We have one fight,
and she runs away?

15:05.844 --> 15:07.882
Well, this is depressing.

15:07.882 --> 15:10.687
I'm just gonna roll around
in that murder stank.

15:19.471 --> 15:20.941
And let this be a lesson

15:20.941 --> 15:24.181
to any other animals pretending
to be my dead husband!

15:24.682 --> 15:26.586
Aw, man!

15:26.586 --> 15:27.387
I'm sorry, buddy.

15:27.487 --> 15:29.024
You don't need
that psycho anyway.

15:29.024 --> 15:30.226
How dare you!

15:30.226 --> 15:32.263
She put me through CPA school

15:32.263 --> 15:34.267
with her ghost kitchen baking.

15:34.267 --> 15:36.038
She just said
you're not Neil.

15:36.038 --> 15:37.842
You don't get it, Cheeks.

15:37.842 --> 15:39.311
You've never been married.

15:39.311 --> 15:41.215
Look, we have to track down
that locket,

15:41.215 --> 15:42.685
which will prove I'm Neil,

15:42.685 --> 15:46.425
and then Diane and I will have
the best makeup bath ever.

15:46.425 --> 15:48.329
Why is this
so important to you?

15:48.329 --> 15:50.399
Well, it seems to me
that being Neil

15:50.399 --> 15:52.203
has given The Gray One
an identity

15:52.303 --> 15:54.307
that's filled his life
with purpose and meaning.

15:54.307 --> 15:56.145
What the Japanese call <i>ikigai,</i>

15:56.245 --> 15:57.380
or "reason for being."

15:57.380 --> 15:59.384
Do you know how stupid
you sound right now?

15:59.384 --> 16:01.956
Just dog up
and help us find the locket.

16:01.956 --> 16:02.958
I'll try my best!

16:05.263 --> 16:07.333
Guys, it's useless.

16:07.333 --> 16:09.739
There's just too much poll--

16:09.739 --> 16:11.074
Ah!

16:11.074 --> 16:12.578
Diablo, are you okay?

16:12.578 --> 16:16.351
No, I think I broke
two of my most adorable ribs.

16:16.351 --> 16:18.055
But I found this!

16:18.055 --> 16:20.193
And this is why she's alone.

16:20.193 --> 16:22.598
The second anyone offers
constructive criticism,

16:22.598 --> 16:23.633
she runs away.

16:23.733 --> 16:25.102
She's just so Jill.

16:25.102 --> 16:26.706
If that even is her name.

16:26.706 --> 16:29.244
- It's definitely her name.
- You don't know that!

16:29.244 --> 16:31.148
She lied about being my mommy!

16:31.148 --> 16:32.818
She's a big liar!

16:32.818 --> 16:34.254
Her name should be Jill-liar!

16:34.254 --> 16:35.691
Okay, wait.
Hold on.

16:35.691 --> 16:37.728
She may not have
given birth to us,

16:37.728 --> 16:38.930
but she is our mother.

16:38.930 --> 16:40.767
Jill is a bad mother!

16:40.767 --> 16:41.435
Shut your snout!

16:41.435 --> 16:43.239
I'm just talking about Jill!

16:43.339 --> 16:44.474
So am I!

16:44.474 --> 16:46.913
Who always cooks us
our own turkey on Thanksgiving?

16:46.913 --> 16:48.583
Jill.

16:48.583 --> 16:50.921
That's right.
And when that snake bit you,

16:51.021 --> 16:53.292
who carried you down
that mountain on her back?

16:53.292 --> 16:54.294
Jill.

16:54.294 --> 16:56.265
She even tried
to suck out the poison.

16:56.265 --> 16:58.770
It was the wrong paw,
but still, Jill.

16:58.770 --> 17:01.709
And who has given her whole
life to taking care of us,

17:01.709 --> 17:04.949
asking nothing in return
but the same unconditional love

17:04.949 --> 17:06.084
she gives us?

17:06.084 --> 17:08.255
And when by some miracle
we have a chance

17:08.255 --> 17:10.794
to tell her just how much
she means to us,

17:10.794 --> 17:14.401
we squander it by being judgy
and controlling...

17:14.401 --> 17:18.475
This is starting to feel like
more of a "you" issue.

17:18.475 --> 17:19.545
What have I done?

17:19.545 --> 17:22.217
I was so desperate
for Jill to know me,

17:22.217 --> 17:24.789
but the me I showed her
isn't my best me,

17:24.789 --> 17:27.327
and now that's the me
she thinks I am

17:27.327 --> 17:30.433
instead of the me that
loves her with all my heart.

17:30.433 --> 17:33.072
I need to tell Jill I love her
while I still can.

17:33.072 --> 17:34.875
Let's go find her!

17:34.875 --> 17:36.078
Shotgun!

17:38.082 --> 17:39.351
Yes!
The locket!

17:39.351 --> 17:40.854
It must've slipped
through the cracks!

17:40.854 --> 17:44.160
What's all this commotion--
you found my locket?

17:46.431 --> 17:47.601
Oh, please.

17:47.601 --> 17:50.473
That's what reincarnated
cat husbands do.

17:50.473 --> 17:52.978
Are you punishing me?

17:52.978 --> 17:55.182
There's my Neil.

17:55.182 --> 17:57.888
Wait, this doesn't
look like mine.

17:57.888 --> 17:59.825
"My Darling Joyce?"

17:59.825 --> 18:00.928
What the--

18:00.928 --> 18:02.363
my sister?

18:02.363 --> 18:05.236
You were sleeping
with my sister?

18:05.236 --> 18:07.875
And you gave her
the same locket as me?

18:07.875 --> 18:10.212
You unoriginal putz!

18:10.212 --> 18:11.616
Diane, I can explain!

18:11.616 --> 18:14.454
I-I'm guessing I did it
to make you jealous?

18:14.454 --> 18:17.861
It's more of our
psychosexual gamesmanship.

18:17.962 --> 18:19.999
And look, it's working.

18:19.999 --> 18:21.234
Huh?

18:22.337 --> 18:24.240
Who are all these women?

18:24.240 --> 18:27.146
What are all these letters
and--and passports?

18:27.146 --> 18:28.650
A fidget spinner?

18:28.650 --> 18:33.693
"To Barbara: You spin me right
round, baby, right round"?

18:33.693 --> 18:35.129
Oh, no!
She's got that

18:35.129 --> 18:37.200
jealous rage/come hither
look again!

18:37.200 --> 18:38.369
You know what?

18:38.369 --> 18:40.774
I'm glad I killed you!

18:40.774 --> 18:42.110
Run!

18:43.546 --> 18:45.817
This is the most cardio
I've ever done!

18:45.817 --> 18:47.888
I so earned a cheat day.

18:47.888 --> 18:50.259
I'm sorry
things didn't pan out.

18:50.259 --> 18:51.929
What do you mean?
It panned out better

18:51.929 --> 18:52.765
than I could've dreamed.

18:52.898 --> 18:56.104
I'm not just some forgettable,
gray cat.

18:56.104 --> 18:58.142
I'm a memorable Neil,

18:58.142 --> 19:00.246
who woos women with lockets

19:00.246 --> 19:01.516
a-and in one case,

19:01.516 --> 19:03.520
a stim toy
for people on the spectrum.

19:03.520 --> 19:04.755
I like this guy.

19:04.755 --> 19:08.395
Diablo, why don't you use
that nose of yours

19:08.395 --> 19:11.769
to find Barbara
and her restless fingers?

19:11.769 --> 19:12.838
Said Neil.

19:12.838 --> 19:14.608
You hear that, Diablo?
You're in!

19:14.608 --> 19:16.445
And I don't expect you
to get me coffee

19:16.445 --> 19:18.248
unless you're getting
some for yourself.

19:18.248 --> 19:21.522
Uh, maybe this is just
the broken ribs talking,

19:21.522 --> 19:24.160
but I don't think I'm a good
fit for this organization.

19:24.160 --> 19:25.564
After all this excitement,

19:25.564 --> 19:28.369
I'd rather spent time at home
alone with my thoughts.

19:28.369 --> 19:30.172
We knew you'd be back.

19:32.978 --> 19:34.080
Hi, Honey.
What are--

19:34.180 --> 19:37.453
I don't mean to cut you off,
but I need to say this.

19:37.453 --> 19:40.560
Every day, both through
your words and your actions,

19:40.560 --> 19:42.731
you tell me
how much you love me,

19:42.731 --> 19:46.471
and until now, I've never had
a way to say it back to you.

19:46.471 --> 19:49.210
Jill, I love you so much.

19:49.210 --> 19:51.314
You've been a friend,
a role model,

19:51.314 --> 19:53.152
a reliable nose booper,

19:53.152 --> 19:55.122
and yes, a mother.

19:55.122 --> 19:56.726
The best mother.

19:56.726 --> 20:00.132
That you picked me to be part
of your life makes me

20:00.132 --> 20:02.705
the luckiest dog in the world.

20:03.807 --> 20:05.476
What's that, pretty girl?

20:05.476 --> 20:07.113
Do you have to go
poo-poo pee-pees?

20:07.113 --> 20:08.348
Outside?

20:08.348 --> 20:10.286
No!
The hippy juice wore off!

20:10.286 --> 20:12.423
She can't understand me!

20:12.423 --> 20:15.664
I blew my one chance
to tell her I love her.

20:15.664 --> 20:17.233
Did you, though?

20:20.607 --> 20:24.314
Oh, I love you too,
good girl!

20:24.314 --> 20:27.153
Hey, quit hogging my mom!

20:33.265 --> 20:34.502
Ugh, you guys!

20:34.502 --> 20:36.906
I can't stop thinking
about last night.

20:36.906 --> 20:39.310
It was absolutely
life-changing.

20:39.310 --> 20:41.883
She remembers!
I knew we had a connection!

20:41.883 --> 20:45.122
I mean, the earlier part
of the night is a bit blurry

20:45.122 --> 20:46.626
and at one point,
I even imagined

20:46.626 --> 20:49.598
the three of us were
having a conversation.

20:49.598 --> 20:51.602
It was real!

20:51.602 --> 20:53.305
And you were being
a little judgy.

20:53.305 --> 20:54.441
Who's my judgy girl?

20:54.441 --> 20:56.712
You're my judgy girl!

20:56.712 --> 20:57.848
I don't love this.

20:57.948 --> 21:01.622
And because of you two,
my life has been transformed.

21:01.622 --> 21:05.296
My whole idea of love
has expanded!

21:05.296 --> 21:07.333
both: Aw!

21:07.333 --> 21:08.302
both: Huh?

21:08.302 --> 21:09.505
Last night was really fun.

21:09.505 --> 21:11.007
You're amazing, Eleanor!

21:11.007 --> 21:12.176
No, you're amazing,

21:12.176 --> 21:14.147
I wanna say... Jane?

21:14.147 --> 21:15.249
Yeah!

21:15.249 --> 21:16.485
It's Jane now.

21:16.485 --> 21:18.155
Okay.
I gotta bounce.

21:18.155 --> 21:19.592
Call me!

21:19.592 --> 21:21.863
How many people can say
they found their girlfriend

21:21.863 --> 21:25.136
and their baby
in the same dumpster?

21:25.136 --> 21:27.273
Jane is living out loud!

21:30.379 --> 21:31.983
Mm.

21:34.187 --> 21:36.057
Bento.

21:37.059 --> 21:37.895
That's nice, Jen and Gabby.
