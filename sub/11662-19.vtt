00:42.133 --> 00:45.433
(tranquil music playing)

01:06.066 --> 01:07.066
Well, it's unspeakable.

01:07.133 --> 01:09.467
That's what it is.
Absolutely unspeakable.

01:09.533 --> 01:12.767
Blanche, are you pretending you just found
your first gray hair again?

01:14.734 --> 01:16.400
Dorothy, just because
you have to walk around

01:16.467 --> 01:20.133
looking like an English lawyer
doesn't mean everybody has to.

01:21.800 --> 01:24.700
For your information,
I'm upset because I had a date

01:24.767 --> 01:25.900
and he canceled.

01:25.967 --> 01:27.934
Oh, honey. I'm sorry.

01:27.967 --> 01:29.467
Was it anybody special?

01:29.533 --> 01:30.633
That's not the point.

01:30.700 --> 01:34.533
He might have taken me someplace
where I'd meet someone who is.

01:35.467 --> 01:36.600
You know, it's amazing.

01:36.667 --> 01:39.867
Beneath that thin veneer
of superficiality,

01:39.934 --> 01:41.467
somehow, miraculously,

01:41.533 --> 01:45.467
there is another,
even thinner veneer.

01:46.400 --> 01:47.533
What am I gonna do?

01:47.600 --> 01:49.667
What on God's green earth
am I gonna do?

01:49.734 --> 01:51.100
You can stay home tonight.

01:51.166 --> 01:54.533
We're gonna watch one of those
John Bradshaw specials on PBS.

01:54.600 --> 01:57.233
Yeah, we're gonna see
if we can't get Dorothy's inner child

01:57.300 --> 01:58.734
to shut up.

02:00.133 --> 02:01.400
Good luck.

02:02.467 --> 02:04.333
I'll call Mel Bushman.

02:04.400 --> 02:06.166
Of course. Mel Bushman.

02:06.233 --> 02:08.667
Old reliable. Mr. Backup.

02:08.734 --> 02:10.333
How long has it been?
What? Three years

02:10.400 --> 02:13.700
that the two of you have
been insignificant others.

02:13.767 --> 02:15.500
Yeah. It has been.

02:15.567 --> 02:18.266
You know, Mel and I
have something really unique.

02:18.333 --> 02:20.734
Well, like, I don’t know,
what do you call it

02:20.800 --> 02:23.600
when two people get together
when they need somebody

02:23.667 --> 02:26.333
but don't make demands on each other
when they're apart?

02:26.400 --> 02:28.400
Out-call massage.

02:31.033 --> 02:32.033
That's odd.

02:32.100 --> 02:33.834
He's usually home by now.

02:33.900 --> 02:35.533
Well, he is the zipper king.

02:37.600 --> 02:40.033
Maybe he got stuck in traffic.

02:40.100 --> 02:41.633
(laughs)

02:45.400 --> 02:46.533
(stammering) Tell me the truth.

02:46.600 --> 02:48.900
Do these glasses
make me look stupid?

02:52.367 --> 02:54.166
Let's just say they don't hide it.

02:56.100 --> 02:59.600
The consumer show asked me
to test these chemically treated lenses.

02:59.667 --> 03:02.734
The theory is they don't fog up
when you come in from the cold.

03:02.800 --> 03:03.967
Excuse me.

03:09.467 --> 03:13.967
Rose, you want to run that looking stupid
question by us again?

03:14.033 --> 03:15.967
(Rose) I'm just doing my job.

03:16.500 --> 03:18.600
Rose, leave the glasses
in the refrigerator,

03:18.667 --> 03:21.500
close the door,
and keep your head out here.

03:21.567 --> 03:24.166
How will I know if they fog?

03:24.233 --> 03:28.734
The little man in there who turns
the light on and off, he'll tell you.

03:29.867 --> 03:32.000
I'm not in the mood for jokes,

03:32.066 --> 03:33.467
especially about the little man.

03:33.533 --> 03:35.467
You know he scares me.

03:38.133 --> 03:40.100
It's really been hitting me lately.

03:40.166 --> 03:44.367
Everybody's job at the TV station
is exciting but mine.

03:44.433 --> 03:47.533
Then look for a more
challenging position.

03:47.600 --> 03:48.767
I did hear something

03:48.834 --> 03:52.066
about an opening
for a weekend news reporter.

03:52.133 --> 03:53.533
What am I saying?

03:53.600 --> 03:55.367
I don't have any experience.

03:55.433 --> 03:56.800
You don't need experience.

03:56.867 --> 03:59.900
You've got the one thing
every TV reporter needs...

03:59.967 --> 04:01.900
hair that doesn't move.

04:04.867 --> 04:07.300
(serene music playing)

04:08.433 --> 04:11.266
Dorothy, Sophia,
I told the news director

04:11.333 --> 04:13.166
I was interested in
the reporter's position.

04:13.233 --> 04:14.700
Guess what he did.

04:14.767 --> 04:17.200
A Danny Thomas spit-take?

04:19.166 --> 04:23.166
No. He's giving me an actual news story
to cover as an audition.

04:23.233 --> 04:24.533
(spits)

04:31.166 --> 04:34.633
So I was hoping you could help me
get comfortable on camera

04:34.700 --> 04:36.934
so I'll be ready for my assignment?

04:37.000 --> 04:40.033
You know, Rose,
that's not a bad idea.

04:40.100 --> 04:41.567
This is the camera.

04:42.266 --> 04:43.934
Let me see you interview Dorothy.

04:44.000 --> 04:46.400
-Oh, no.
-Dorothy, please.

04:46.467 --> 04:47.967
I'm not good at this.

04:48.033 --> 04:49.967
This is a pretend microphone.

04:50.033 --> 04:52.967
It's really just a hairbrush.

04:55.567 --> 04:58.266
All right, Rose. Ready? Go.

04:59.433 --> 05:01.033
This is Rose Nylund.

05:01.100 --> 05:04.567
We're here chatting with my good friend
Dorothy Zbornak.

05:04.633 --> 05:06.033
Welcome, Dorothy.

05:07.967 --> 05:10.333
Hello. It's a pleasure to be here.

05:12.834 --> 05:14.934
Can you tell me what--

05:15.000 --> 05:17.033
So, tell me, Dorothy,

05:17.100 --> 05:19.533
what's it like being
a substitute teacher?

05:19.600 --> 05:21.100
Rose, honey, excuse me.

05:21.166 --> 05:23.367
Take another tack.

05:23.433 --> 05:25.433
I'm not saying that my job is boring.

05:25.500 --> 05:27.667
Say it, Dorothy. Say it.

05:29.867 --> 05:33.066
I just feel you should ask more
probing questions.

05:33.133 --> 05:34.867
Okey-dokey. Let's see.

05:34.934 --> 05:37.233
Oh.

05:37.767 --> 05:42.000
Isn't it a fact that you have a drawer
full of retirement home brochures

05:42.066 --> 05:45.767
and you're just waiting for the first sign
of dribble on your mother's chin

05:45.834 --> 05:47.800
to lock her away forever?

05:59.100 --> 06:01.934
(laughs) She's... she's kidding.

06:04.433 --> 06:07.033
Your sock drawer, Dorothy.
You know, the...

06:08.667 --> 06:11.166
the one you know who can't reach.

06:12.233 --> 06:13.934
I knew you kept pictures there,

06:14.000 --> 06:15.266
but I had no idea.

06:15.333 --> 06:17.233
You disgust me.

06:17.300 --> 06:19.300
Look. I won't stand for this.

06:19.367 --> 06:21.000
Nail her, Rose.

06:21.066 --> 06:23.367
Remember, a good reporter
always gets her story,

06:23.433 --> 06:24.834
no matter what.

06:26.200 --> 06:28.166
That sock drawer
is my business.

06:28.233 --> 06:30.367
Look. Those times that ma
makes me crazy,

06:30.433 --> 06:34.133
I go into my room and have some
pretend time, okay?

06:37.700 --> 06:38.934
This is Rose Nylund

06:39.000 --> 06:42.533
signing off in a sad, sad situation.

06:45.100 --> 06:47.533
Thanks, Dorothy.
That was fun.

06:49.066 --> 06:54.166
Girls, I called Mel all last night
and all of today.

06:54.233 --> 06:55.667
I haven't reached him yet.

06:55.734 --> 06:56.700
The nerve.

06:56.767 --> 07:00.400
If you wind up reading a book
because of that man...

07:01.400 --> 07:03.900
Where can he be,
he never leaves the house,

07:03.967 --> 07:05.100
not even for me.

07:05.166 --> 07:08.300
What is this Bushmania
all of sudden?

07:08.367 --> 07:10.900
You see this man five times a year...

07:10.967 --> 07:12.367
A man you yourself describe

07:12.433 --> 07:15.600
as "Fred Flintstone with a better car."

07:19.133 --> 07:20.934
Well, I may say things like that,

07:21.000 --> 07:22.066
but the truth is,

07:22.133 --> 07:26.233
Mel makes me feel young
and beautiful and special.

07:26.300 --> 07:28.667
When we're together,
we laugh a lot.

07:28.734 --> 07:30.700
Why wouldn't you?
You're both naked.

07:39.300 --> 07:42.567
There's more to us
than just the physical.

07:42.633 --> 07:43.867
We share things.

07:43.934 --> 07:45.934
I'm not intimate with just anybody.

07:46.000 --> 07:50.133
Oh, yeah? What about the guy
who painted our address on the curb?

07:53.934 --> 07:56.266
You make it sound
like a one-night stand.

07:56.333 --> 07:59.200
He'll be back when it's faded.

08:01.500 --> 08:05.133
Honey, Mel's probably
just busy with work,

08:05.200 --> 08:06.400
not answering the phone.

08:06.467 --> 08:08.367
You'll reach him. You always do.

08:08.433 --> 08:10.900
You're worrying for nothing.

08:10.967 --> 08:12.767
I remember back in St. Olaf--

08:12.834 --> 08:15.066
Hold it right there, Will Rogers.

08:15.133 --> 08:17.867
We don't want to hear
a St. Olaf story.

08:17.934 --> 08:20.000
Well, here's one anyway.

08:20.066 --> 08:21.533
But to show you I'm a good sport,

08:21.600 --> 08:24.000
I'll get right to the part
that'll make Blanche feel better.

08:27.500 --> 08:28.433
Ah.

08:28.500 --> 08:30.066
Anyway...

08:32.200 --> 08:35.233
Everybody in the village hated Ingmar.

08:35.300 --> 08:36.934
So we grabbed our torches

08:37.000 --> 08:39.433
and climbed the hill to his castle

08:39.500 --> 08:41.734
and pounded on the great oak door,

08:41.800 --> 08:43.600
but there was no answer.

08:43.667 --> 08:44.900
We got a ladder

08:44.967 --> 08:46.700
and climbed up to the window.

08:46.767 --> 08:47.834
We peeked in,

08:47.900 --> 08:51.567
and to our relief,
there was Ingmar lying...

08:51.633 --> 08:54.600
Oh. Wait a minute.
He was dead.

08:59.533 --> 09:01.567
What if she's right?

09:01.633 --> 09:03.000
What if something's
happened to Mel?

09:03.066 --> 09:04.333
Good going, Rose.

09:04.400 --> 09:05.767
Girls, I'm frightened.

09:05.834 --> 09:08.033
Go with me to check on Mel.

09:08.100 --> 09:12.567
Of course, but there's
nothing to worry about.

09:12.633 --> 09:14.967
I thought you said that
story would help.

09:15.400 --> 09:16.867
Well, it did.

09:16.934 --> 09:20.734
You don't know how long I've waited
to get that off my chest.

09:24.967 --> 09:27.734
There must be two weeks of papers here.

09:27.800 --> 09:31.433
Calm down. This doesn't say dead.
It says...

09:32.300 --> 09:35.233
Okay. Let's get this over with.

09:35.300 --> 09:37.100
We better think this over.

09:37.166 --> 09:40.266
We have no right to break into
somebody's home.

09:40.333 --> 09:43.233
We're not breaking in. I have a key.

09:50.266 --> 09:51.467
Let's see.

09:53.600 --> 09:55.834
"Baldwin."

09:55.900 --> 09:57.300
"Baxter."

09:57.367 --> 09:58.400
Ah. Here it is.

09:58.467 --> 10:01.900
"Bushman".
No. That's Al Bushman.

10:01.967 --> 10:04.600
Here we go. "Mel bushman."

10:04.667 --> 10:06.567
You know, girls,
I've been thinking.

10:06.633 --> 10:08.433
Ever since Mel and I met,

10:08.500 --> 10:11.934
I always figured he'd be around
when I needed him.

10:12.000 --> 10:13.667
I never thought
about his needs.

10:13.734 --> 10:15.867
All I cared about were mine.

10:15.934 --> 10:19.166
I figured he'd be available,
and he was.

10:19.233 --> 10:21.133
He's always been there for me.

10:21.200 --> 10:23.000
I just took him for granted.

10:23.066 --> 10:25.500
Oh, honey, don't do
this to yourself.

10:25.567 --> 10:28.867
You take everyone for granted.

10:28.934 --> 10:31.734
(sighs) Thank you, Dorothy.

10:37.333 --> 10:40.533
Well, so far,
nothing seems out of place.

10:42.233 --> 10:44.066
Look at this exercycle.

10:44.133 --> 10:45.600
It's never been used.

10:45.667 --> 10:46.967
Oh, yeah. We've been on it.

10:47.033 --> 10:48.934
Don't ask, Ma.

10:50.166 --> 10:52.367
Oh, Dorothy, look.

10:52.433 --> 10:54.934
The zipper king's
one millionth zipper.

10:54.967 --> 10:56.967
Oh.

10:57.033 --> 10:59.233
I will never be able
to look at another zipper

10:59.300 --> 11:01.800
without thinking of Mel.

11:01.867 --> 11:05.266
Let it go, honey. Let it go.

11:08.967 --> 11:10.567
Mel, is that really you?

11:10.633 --> 11:12.433
No, it's Claus von Bulow.

11:12.500 --> 11:15.400
Oh, Mel, it's great to see you.

11:15.467 --> 11:17.066
Blanche thought you were dead.

11:17.133 --> 11:18.767
She did? I love it.

11:18.834 --> 11:20.934
You think something
could kill me?

11:21.000 --> 11:22.367
Where have you been?

11:22.433 --> 11:25.367
-On vacation. What's the big deal?
-(sighs)

11:25.433 --> 11:26.834
What made you think
I was dead?

11:26.900 --> 11:30.633
If Mel Bushman doesn't answer my call,
something must be wrong.

11:30.700 --> 11:34.700
You weren't there.
You're always there when I need you.

11:34.767 --> 11:36.734
Well, when you deliver such services,

11:36.800 --> 11:39.500
occasionally a man's
got to take a vacation.

11:41.066 --> 11:43.367
All that matters now
is you're alive.

11:43.433 --> 11:44.867
You're alive, and we're together.

11:44.934 --> 11:46.734
I'm never going to let you go.

11:47.433 --> 11:49.133
Tell me she's being dramatic.

11:50.800 --> 11:53.767
When I thought
I'd never see you again,

11:53.834 --> 11:56.800
I began to realize
what you meant to me,

11:56.867 --> 11:58.734
how I've taken you for granted,

11:58.800 --> 12:02.633
and how many things
I've never said to you.

12:02.700 --> 12:07.133
What I'm saying is I realize
how much you mean to me.

12:07.200 --> 12:09.100
I don't need anybody else.

12:09.166 --> 12:12.533
I want to be a one-man woman,
and you're it.

12:12.600 --> 12:15.100
Mel bushman, I love you.

12:25.700 --> 12:28.433
(tranquil music playing)

12:30.166 --> 12:32.133
I'm all ready
for my big date.

12:32.200 --> 12:34.300
What big date?
You're going out with Mel Bushman.

12:34.367 --> 12:36.433
I know. Isn't it wonderful?

12:36.500 --> 12:39.900
Tonight, Mel and I are starting
a brand-new relationship.

12:39.967 --> 12:41.834
Do you realize
how rare it is to find out

12:41.900 --> 12:43.433
the person you've
been sleeping with

12:43.500 --> 12:45.767
is the person you love?

12:48.567 --> 12:50.233
No, but you can't go by me.

12:50.300 --> 12:51.834
I have morals.

12:51.900 --> 12:53.700
Oh.

12:54.400 --> 12:56.033
Girls, great news.

12:56.100 --> 12:58.800
I got my assignment,
and it's a biggie.

12:58.867 --> 13:01.867
A biggie. Real big.
Big, big, big.

13:01.934 --> 13:02.800
Cat show?

13:02.867 --> 13:04.600
Dog show.

13:05.967 --> 13:08.233
Miami's 13th annual.

13:08.300 --> 13:10.133
That's right, ladies.
This afternoon,

13:10.200 --> 13:13.367
I'm getting the scoop
on man's best friend.

13:14.667 --> 13:16.200
Congratulations, honey.

13:16.266 --> 13:18.100
I know you'll do
a great job.

13:18.166 --> 13:21.734
I just wish my mother and father
could see this.

13:21.800 --> 13:23.633
Because they'd be so proud?

13:23.700 --> 13:25.900
No, because they'd be alive.

13:29.767 --> 13:31.333
I've got goose bumps.

13:31.400 --> 13:32.967
Mel will be here any minute.

13:33.033 --> 13:37.033
Why so jumpy? You've been out
with Mel a thousand times.

13:37.100 --> 13:38.934
Oh, but now there's more at stake.

13:39.000 --> 13:40.200
Everything's changed.

13:40.266 --> 13:42.400
It's all new and exciting.

13:42.467 --> 13:44.900
In many ways I feel
just the way I felt

13:44.967 --> 13:46.533
when I was a virgin.

13:51.033 --> 13:53.567
You mean the feeling
isn't going to last long?

13:57.567 --> 14:01.400
Are you implying
I lost my virginity at an early age?

14:01.467 --> 14:04.800
You're lucky <i>Jack And Jill</i> magazine
didn't do gossip.

14:04.867 --> 14:06.600
Ma!

14:08.066 --> 14:10.600
Please, pussycat, I'm on a roll.

14:10.667 --> 14:12.166
I'm sorry, Sophia,

14:12.233 --> 14:16.000
but I'm not letting your skepticism
ruin my evening.

14:16.066 --> 14:18.100
Mel and I were meant
to be together.

14:18.166 --> 14:20.667
I wish I could say
the same for your thighs.

14:29.266 --> 14:31.066
God, I'm hot tonight.

14:32.333 --> 14:34.033
I won't stand for this.

14:34.100 --> 14:35.133
Take it, Dorothy.

14:35.200 --> 14:37.433
But I bet you'll lay down for it.

14:44.133 --> 14:46.166
Well, that was
just plain rude.

14:49.667 --> 14:52.066
Some people just don't know
when to quit.

14:58.800 --> 15:01.000
Look how they pamper these dogs.

15:01.066 --> 15:02.300
They eat when they want to,

15:02.367 --> 15:03.834
sleep when they want to,

15:03.900 --> 15:06.200
go to the bathroom anywhere they...

15:06.266 --> 15:08.367
Hey, I do have it pretty good.

15:09.467 --> 15:10.967
If I could just get you
to crack the window

15:11.033 --> 15:12.767
when you lock me in the car.

15:14.166 --> 15:16.600
Ma, stop it. Now, I want you
to behave yourself.

15:16.667 --> 15:19.433
We're here to give Rose
moral support on her big day,

15:19.500 --> 15:21.200
and I don't want you doing
or saying anything

15:21.266 --> 15:22.300
to embarrass her.

15:22.367 --> 15:24.066
-Hi, girls.
-(Dorothy) Hi, Rose.

15:24.133 --> 15:27.200
This is Andy.
He's my cameraman.

15:27.266 --> 15:28.533
Andy, these are my friends.

15:28.600 --> 15:29.934
Where should we set up?

15:30.000 --> 15:33.567
I'm not sure, Mrs. Nylund.
This is my audition, too.

15:33.633 --> 15:34.900
Over there?

15:35.000 --> 15:38.166
-Whatever you say.
-Whatever you say.

15:38.233 --> 15:41.433
The blind videotaping the blind.

15:42.834 --> 15:43.967
Here goes.

15:44.033 --> 15:46.533
And...we're rolling.

15:46.600 --> 15:50.600
We're here at the 13th
annual Miami pet dog expo,

15:50.667 --> 15:54.133
-where you'll be--
-All right! Everybody! Hands up!

15:54.200 --> 15:56.500
You, behind the desk!
I want the cash.

15:56.567 --> 15:59.266
Everyone else, I want your
wallets and your jewelry.

15:59.333 --> 16:01.400
We've got to do something.

16:01.467 --> 16:04.133
He's got a gun.
What do we do?

16:04.200 --> 16:07.166
The only thing
a good reporter can do...

16:07.233 --> 16:09.233
Get the story, no matter what.

16:09.300 --> 16:13.867
Just point your camera
and do exactly as I say.

16:14.867 --> 16:16.367
Give me the ring!

16:17.967 --> 16:19.100
Hurry up!

16:21.333 --> 16:22.700
This is far enough.

16:22.767 --> 16:25.767
Thanks for making this evening
a total disaster.

16:25.834 --> 16:27.567
Sweetheart, give yourself some credit.

16:27.633 --> 16:30.100
It wouldn't have been
a total disaster without you.

16:30.166 --> 16:33.233
Oh, really...

16:33.300 --> 16:37.867
Mr. No-guy-with-an-
earring-parks-my-car.

16:37.934 --> 16:39.767
You'd think an elegant
restaurant like that

16:39.834 --> 16:41.300
would bring out
the best in a man.

16:41.367 --> 16:44.533
What it brought out
was $250 from my wallet.

16:44.600 --> 16:46.433
It was a special occasion.

16:46.500 --> 16:52.000
Where I'm from,
$250 is five special occasions...

16:52.066 --> 16:53.433
and a bottle of scotch.

16:53.500 --> 16:54.600
You'd think for all that money,

16:54.667 --> 16:56.567
they'd hang a picture on the wall.

16:56.633 --> 17:00.367
The minimalist decor is designed
to enhance conversation.

17:00.433 --> 17:03.433
Nothing to look at...
what's to talk about?

17:03.500 --> 17:05.400
I'd think I'd be enough.

17:05.467 --> 17:08.834
We didn't have to go
on a date for that.

17:08.900 --> 17:10.166
You think I'm boring?

17:10.233 --> 17:14.800
No, sweetheart,
I think you're fantastic.

17:14.867 --> 17:18.433
With a guy like me,
a little fantastic goes a long way.

17:18.500 --> 17:20.100
I mean, look what we got now.

17:20.166 --> 17:21.567
Every few weeks you call

17:21.633 --> 17:23.433
when one of your boyfriends
don't show up.

17:23.500 --> 17:26.133
I say, "Bushman awaits."

17:26.200 --> 17:30.266
We rent a movie,
order some takeout, talk about you.

17:30.333 --> 17:31.734
That's entertainment.

17:31.800 --> 17:34.533
-(laughs)
-(Mel) I love that.

17:34.600 --> 17:36.100
And we cuddle.

17:36.166 --> 17:38.767
Sometimes we do
more than cuddle.

17:38.834 --> 17:41.400
Sometimes you stay.

17:41.467 --> 17:42.967
That's the part I like the best...

17:43.033 --> 17:44.333
when you stay.

17:45.333 --> 17:48.800
Every couple of weeks, you bring
a little class to Bushman's place.

17:48.867 --> 17:51.667
Why, Mel Bushman,
are you saying you love me?

17:51.734 --> 17:53.633
Yeah.

17:53.700 --> 17:54.734
I love you...

17:54.800 --> 17:56.900
the way we are now.

17:56.967 --> 18:00.133
But you start with relationships
and love

18:00.200 --> 18:02.500
and I got to put on a tie twice a week

18:02.567 --> 18:06.633
to eat food I can't even see,
we got a problem.

18:06.700 --> 18:08.266
I guess that without
thinking about it,

18:08.333 --> 18:11.100
you've become a very comfortable
part of my life.

18:11.166 --> 18:13.834
When I thought you were gone,

18:13.900 --> 18:16.133
suddenly, life wasn't so
comfortable anymore.

18:16.200 --> 18:17.433
I really missed you.

18:17.500 --> 18:20.934
Nah. You missed knowing
Bushman awaits.

18:22.100 --> 18:25.033
Hey, I haven't spent this much time
thinking about feelings

18:25.100 --> 18:27.500
since we rented
the Alan Alda collection.

18:28.567 --> 18:30.734
Mel, I think it's pretty obvious

18:30.800 --> 18:33.133
our new relationship
isn't going to work out.

18:33.200 --> 18:34.333
I don't think so.

18:34.400 --> 18:37.133
Let's call it off and go back
to being friends.

18:37.200 --> 18:39.000
-Okay.
-I got a great idea.

18:39.066 --> 18:41.100
Come to my place. I'm hungry.

18:41.166 --> 18:43.166
I'll go to Wolfie's for pastrami,

18:43.233 --> 18:44.800
and we'll rent <i>Out Of Africa.</i>

18:44.867 --> 18:46.133
We've rented it five times

18:46.200 --> 18:47.967
and never made it through to the end.

18:48.033 --> 18:51.433
I know, but it always works.

18:53.000 --> 18:55.734
I do love you, Mel, as a friend.

18:55.800 --> 18:57.567
Like I said, sweetheart,

18:57.633 --> 18:59.667
you got a lot of class.

19:02.000 --> 19:03.600
Life sucks!

19:06.233 --> 19:07.400
Hi, Mel.

19:09.600 --> 19:12.233
You run home.
I'll come after I check on Rose.

19:12.300 --> 19:14.834
Bushman awaits.

19:17.600 --> 19:19.133
I didn't get it.

19:19.200 --> 19:21.166
-What?
-I didn't get the job!

19:21.233 --> 19:24.367
Oh, Rose, your little dog show
not go well?

19:24.433 --> 19:26.900
I'm so sorry.
Let's talk about me, then.

19:29.333 --> 19:32.967
Blanche, Rose did something
absolutely incredible tonight.

19:33.033 --> 19:34.467
There was a robbery at the dog show.

19:34.533 --> 19:36.266
-Ma and I were held hostage.
-(Blanche gasps)

19:36.333 --> 19:38.266
Rose was the only reporter there.

19:38.333 --> 19:41.400
Well, shoot. I missed everything.

19:41.467 --> 19:43.300
-Let's see the tape.
-Okay.

19:47.500 --> 19:50.467
<i>This is Rose Nylund</i>
<i>for Channel 8 News</i>

19:50.533 --> 19:52.967
<i>here at the Miami pet dog expo,</i>

19:53.033 --> 19:56.000
<i>and I am an eyewitness</i>
<i>to something shocking...</i>

19:56.066 --> 19:57.700
(gunshots)

19:57.767 --> 20:00.967
<i>People who look</i>
<i>like their dogs.</i>

20:02.900 --> 20:05.667
I said keep quiet
and don't move!

20:05.734 --> 20:08.400
That handsome fella back there
with his hand in the air

20:08.467 --> 20:10.934
is Brian Kingsley
of Boca Raton.

20:11.000 --> 20:13.900
With him is his
best buddy Barney,

20:13.967 --> 20:17.166
a basset hound you'd swear
was a family member.

20:17.233 --> 20:18.500
<i>As we move closer,</i>

20:18.567 --> 20:20.233
you'll notice Barney's collar

20:20.300 --> 20:22.367
matches Brian's Rolex.

20:24.700 --> 20:25.900
What do you think so far?

20:25.967 --> 20:27.567
I'm glad I wasn't there.

20:27.633 --> 20:29.800
TV does put 10 pounds on you.

20:31.667 --> 20:35.000
I'm here beneath the information table
with Bill Peterson

20:35.066 --> 20:37.800
and his similarly profiled bulldog
Churchill.

20:37.867 --> 20:39.266
It's amazing.

20:39.333 --> 20:41.400
That bulldog could be your brother,

20:41.467 --> 20:44.166
but I guess you get that a lot.

20:44.233 --> 20:46.200
Actually, I do.

20:46.266 --> 20:47.600
(gunshots)

20:47.667 --> 20:50.333
Uh, could we discuss this later?

20:52.033 --> 20:53.367
Wow!

20:53.433 --> 20:56.600
Oh, thank you, Blanche,
but there's more.

20:56.667 --> 21:00.400
The police have just informed me
that there was also a robbery

21:00.467 --> 21:02.567
by an unidentified man.

21:02.633 --> 21:05.367
Perhaps this little fellow knows
who he is.

21:17.033 --> 21:19.533
I did that last part
after everything quieted down.

21:19.600 --> 21:21.633
I thought it would kind of
tie things together.

21:21.700 --> 21:24.233
(all) Wow.

21:25.600 --> 21:27.867
You didn't cover
the robbery at all?

21:27.934 --> 21:29.567
Was I wrong again?

21:29.633 --> 21:31.467
I could have
covered the holdup,

21:31.533 --> 21:35.000
but it would've seemed like
I was giving in to sensationalism.

21:35.066 --> 21:36.500
I'm a reporter, damn it.

21:36.567 --> 21:39.667
They sent me to cover a story,
and that's what I did.

21:39.734 --> 21:41.667
I don't believe this.

21:41.734 --> 21:44.433
Rose, this was the
opportunity of a lifetime.

21:44.500 --> 21:46.867
A one-in-a-million shot.
How could--?

21:46.934 --> 21:51.300
How could--? How could they not
have given you the job, Rose?

21:51.367 --> 21:53.400
Maybe the issue here is one of...

21:53.467 --> 21:57.100
what can we call it...
uh, editorial judgment.

21:57.166 --> 22:00.600
-Really, you think so?
-Yes, Rose, I do.

22:00.667 --> 22:04.300
I guess it just isn't the story
they wanted.

22:04.367 --> 22:05.700
Damn, you're good.

22:11.100 --> 22:13.967
Thanks, Dorothy.
That makes me feel so much better.

22:14.033 --> 22:17.467
To tell you the truth,
I'm still not ashamed of what I did.

22:17.533 --> 22:21.667
If Deborah Norville stopped
for every serious news story,

22:21.734 --> 22:24.233
she wouldn't be where she is today.

22:25.867 --> 22:27.867
Well, Bushman awaits.

22:27.934 --> 22:30.400
You know, I learned
something tonight.

22:30.467 --> 22:32.066
A relationship is more

22:32.133 --> 22:35.834
than sex and fun
and videos and good times.

22:36.667 --> 22:39.233
Thank God this isn't a relationship.

22:49.800 --> 22:53.667
(theme music playing)
