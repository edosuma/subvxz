WEBVTT

00:03.737 --> 00:07.606
Pick up. Come on, pick up.

00:07.608 --> 00:09.208
Hey, it's me.

00:09.210 --> 00:10.242
We need to talk.

00:10.244 --> 00:11.643
I can explain everything.

00:12.712 --> 00:14.780
Call me.

00:28.728 --> 00:29.795
(phone beeps off)

00:31.731 --> 00:34.066
(door creaks open)

00:34.068 --> 00:36.535
(door creaks shut)

00:36.537 --> 00:38.170
(squeaky honk)

00:38.172 --> 00:40.039
(footsteps approaching)

00:45.111 --> 00:46.645
(squeaky honking)

00:49.182 --> 00:50.249
(squeaky honk)

00:58.324 --> 00:59.491
No!

01:36.696 --> 01:39.098
Woman: Then there's
your medical history...

01:39.100 --> 01:41.834
The li-90 for life insurance,
the da-93...

01:41.836 --> 01:45.170
You're lucky this is just
a temp joint duty assignment.

01:45.172 --> 01:46.738
Just a few forms left.

01:46.740 --> 01:48.740
Like the notification
of personnel action,

01:48.742 --> 01:50.576
The ta-44 and
the background questionnaire

01:50.578 --> 01:52.311
For your new
security clearance.

01:53.446 --> 01:55.781
Roda.
Bishop's gonna
be useless

01:55.783 --> 01:57.282
For the next week.

01:57.284 --> 01:58.283
Should we rescue her?

01:58.285 --> 02:01.820
If she can't handle roda,
gibbs is gonna melt her brain.

02:01.822 --> 02:03.822
Oh! And I'm gonna need...

02:03.824 --> 02:07.292
The dd-817 asap.

02:07.294 --> 02:10.362
Oh, this is actually
version 6045.

02:10.364 --> 02:12.464
The dod is up to
v49 on the dd-817.

02:16.402 --> 02:18.303
Black pen only, no smudges.

02:18.305 --> 02:19.505
And don't test me...

02:19.507 --> 02:21.140
Kitty-cat.

02:25.211 --> 02:27.412
Roda: I can see you,
gentlemen.

02:29.215 --> 02:30.382
What just happened?

02:30.384 --> 02:31.817
Did I do something wrong?

02:31.819 --> 02:34.153
No, you just passed
your first test.

02:34.155 --> 02:36.355
Roda, from hr--
(whispering): Legendary.

02:36.357 --> 02:37.623
Mcgee:
But don't get too cocky.

02:37.625 --> 02:39.291
Still got to take
that polygraph.

02:39.293 --> 02:41.226
I have to take
<i>another</i> polygraph?

02:41.228 --> 02:42.561
Mm-hmm.
And then all you have to do

02:42.563 --> 02:44.363
Is survive special agent
leroy jethro gibbs.

02:44.365 --> 02:46.365
In case you haven't
heard, the man is...
He's actually

02:46.367 --> 02:47.466
Coming up
behind you right now.

02:50.303 --> 02:51.370
Hmm.

02:51.372 --> 02:52.404
You're not supposed
to do that.

02:52.406 --> 02:55.407
What did I do now?

02:55.409 --> 02:56.842
You've made a friend.

02:56.844 --> 02:59.478
Got a dead marine
in potomac heights.

03:01.581 --> 03:03.749
You waiting
on something, bishop?

03:03.751 --> 03:05.217
I don't have any gear.

03:05.219 --> 03:07.219
Good. You can drive.

03:07.221 --> 03:09.321
Okay.

03:11.391 --> 03:13.358
Corporal ron flegman,

03:13.360 --> 03:14.493
23, stationed
out of quantico,

03:14.495 --> 03:16.528
Worked in the motor pool.

03:17.630 --> 03:19.464
He live here alone?

03:19.466 --> 03:20.499
Upstairs.

03:20.501 --> 03:21.967
Already spoke with his co.

03:21.969 --> 03:25.204
Solid marine,
stellar evaluations.

03:25.206 --> 03:26.205
Not much else.

03:26.207 --> 03:27.472
Well, if this was a mugging,

03:27.474 --> 03:28.507
It was a really bad one.

03:28.509 --> 03:29.675
We got a witness.

03:29.677 --> 03:32.644
He saw someone enter

03:32.646 --> 03:35.480
The back of the building
just prior to the shooting.

03:35.482 --> 03:38.317
We even got a sketch,
courtesy of magic fingers here.

03:38.319 --> 03:39.484
Here you go.

03:41.421 --> 03:43.422
That's a clown.

03:43.424 --> 03:44.823
Well, uh, a street
performer, yes.

03:44.825 --> 03:46.858
See, there weren't
very many details,

03:46.860 --> 03:49.461
So I used jumpy, from <i>jumpy's</i>
<i>funhouse,</i> as a template.

03:49.463 --> 03:51.430
Jumpy had this
really big, like,

03:51.432 --> 03:54.533
(laughs) this, like, red nose,
and when he smiled,

03:54.535 --> 03:56.835
(chuckles): He... It was this
kids show I used to watch,

03:56.837 --> 03:58.537
When I was little.

03:58.539 --> 04:01.406
Um, we were told there were
several street performers

04:01.408 --> 04:02.841
Who work the area.

04:02.843 --> 04:05.944
With any luck, maybe
jumpy the clown had a permit.

04:05.946 --> 04:07.412
Check the licensing office.

04:07.414 --> 04:09.281
Pull every permit
on the block.

04:09.283 --> 04:10.882
Nice.

04:10.884 --> 04:13.018
Ducky:
Oh, thank heavens we're indoors.

04:13.020 --> 04:14.920
It's been a brutal week.

04:14.922 --> 04:18.257
And I have a chill
I just can't shake.

04:18.259 --> 04:21.493
Me too. Anybody mind
if I do some jumping jacks?

04:21.495 --> 04:23.495
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.

04:23.497 --> 04:25.397
Well, preliminary
cause of death appears to be

04:25.399 --> 04:27.499
Two gunshot wounds
to the chest.

04:28.768 --> 04:30.469
Yeah. From medium range.

04:30.471 --> 04:31.470
Ah, ms. Bishop.

04:31.472 --> 04:33.305
Would you care to take

04:33.307 --> 04:34.740
A closer look at the wound?

04:34.742 --> 04:36.408
Uh...

04:36.410 --> 04:37.609
Sure.

04:37.611 --> 04:38.877
Yeah.

04:38.879 --> 04:40.879
Ducky:
Note this one.

04:40.881 --> 04:42.481
It's oval in shape,

04:42.483 --> 04:43.749
Which means that the bullet

04:43.751 --> 04:46.285
Penetrated the skin at an angle.

04:46.287 --> 04:48.587
Huh. Can you get
a trajectory from that?

04:48.589 --> 04:50.956
Well, possible trajectory, yeah.

04:50.958 --> 04:52.424
Very astute.

04:52.426 --> 04:54.893
Also, we get
a core temperature,

04:54.895 --> 04:57.596
We can approximate
time of death.

04:57.598 --> 04:59.564
Boss, he's got
a second cell phone.

04:59.566 --> 05:00.666
Anything on it?

05:00.668 --> 05:02.467
Well, it's
password-locked,

05:02.469 --> 05:03.635
But looks like
he received

05:03.637 --> 05:05.337
Almost a dozen missed calls

05:05.339 --> 05:06.738
Just prior to
the shooting.

05:06.740 --> 05:08.740
Maybe somebody was
trying to warn him.

05:08.742 --> 05:10.509
I know that number.

05:10.511 --> 05:11.743
Adams house hotel.

05:11.745 --> 05:13.679
Doesn't your dad
always stay there?

05:13.681 --> 05:14.880
Yes, but...

05:14.882 --> 05:16.048
No, no, no.

05:16.050 --> 05:17.482
He's at a skin peel retreat,

05:17.484 --> 05:19.451
300 miles away,
so there's no way.

05:19.453 --> 05:21.687
You know, checkout's
in half an hour.

05:21.689 --> 05:23.522
Whoever called our victim
might still be there.

05:23.524 --> 05:24.656
Mcgee, you got
the crime scene.

05:24.658 --> 05:26.658
Dinozzo, with me.

05:27.727 --> 05:29.728
Uh...

05:29.730 --> 05:31.596
That... That was...

05:31.598 --> 05:32.764
That was fast.

05:32.766 --> 05:34.833
Fast.
Yeah.

05:38.771 --> 05:41.640
Manager said the calls
came from room 103.

05:41.642 --> 05:43.041
Registered to mr. Smith.

05:43.043 --> 05:44.943
I'm gonna go with "alias,"
what do you think?

05:44.945 --> 05:47.079
Gibbs:
Manager coming to open it up?

05:47.081 --> 05:48.080
No.

05:48.082 --> 05:49.748
She gave me the key.

05:49.750 --> 05:53.518
Since it's two minutes
after checkout, technically,

05:53.520 --> 05:55.020
We have a right
to enter.

05:56.723 --> 05:58.790
(lock blipping,
latch clicking)

06:04.364 --> 06:06.431
That's funny,
that looks like your ex-wife.

06:07.600 --> 06:09.634
Champagne first, and then...

06:09.636 --> 06:10.869
A little...

06:16.609 --> 06:18.910
Well, tie me up
and call me loretta.

06:29.922 --> 06:31.056
Wow.

06:31.058 --> 06:31.990
Wowzers.

06:31.992 --> 06:34.459
This is not what it looks like.

06:34.461 --> 06:36.461
Right.
We were just...

06:36.463 --> 06:38.997
No, I do not need the details.

06:38.999 --> 06:42.768
Okay, look...
Zip it, windbag.
Not another word.

06:42.770 --> 06:45.637
What are you talking about?
The cat is out of the bag.

06:45.639 --> 06:46.638
(sighs)

06:46.640 --> 06:48.707
It just sort of happened, okay?

06:48.709 --> 06:51.543
We were gonna tell you. We just
kept it hush-hush because...

06:51.545 --> 06:54.446
She's married.
Because we're concerned

06:54.448 --> 06:55.781
That emily won't take it well.

06:55.783 --> 06:57.883
She's 13, this can be...

06:57.885 --> 06:59.751
Confusing.
And victor and I are separated,

06:59.753 --> 07:01.887
We're getting a divorce.

07:01.889 --> 07:05.157
Your turn. What the hell
are you doing in our room?

07:05.159 --> 07:07.626
Well, we got
a dead marine.

07:07.628 --> 07:09.795
His cell phone got
a call from this room

07:09.797 --> 07:12.097
Just prior to his murder.
Fornell:
That's impossible.

07:12.099 --> 07:13.999
We've been in this
room since last night,

07:14.001 --> 07:15.767
And I haven't
used the phone.

07:15.769 --> 07:17.803
Oh, but I'm getting
a feeling she has.

07:19.972 --> 07:21.106
Diane...?

07:21.108 --> 07:22.441
Hmm?

07:23.543 --> 07:24.776
Could I speak with you?

07:24.778 --> 07:26.044
Privately?

07:26.046 --> 07:28.046
If you'd like to be shot.
Okay, fine.

07:28.048 --> 07:29.147
I used the phone.

07:29.149 --> 07:31.149
But not to call
some marine.

07:31.151 --> 07:33.118
I was trying to call
my boyfriend eddie.

07:33.120 --> 07:35.720
Oh, that's funny. It sounded
like you said boyfriend.

07:35.722 --> 07:38.123
Well, ex-boyfriend, now.
I was calling to break it off.

07:38.125 --> 07:40.492
While I was in the bathtub?

07:40.494 --> 07:43.662
You had a boyfriend
while I was in the bathtub?
But he never picked up.

07:43.664 --> 07:45.764
So, you don't know
private ron flegman?

07:45.766 --> 07:47.933
It's probably her fiancÃ©e.
This is unbelievable.

07:47.935 --> 07:49.801
No, I've never heard
that name in my life.

07:49.803 --> 07:50.902
(sighs)
no, you know what?

07:50.904 --> 07:52.637
You need to calm down.

07:52.639 --> 07:55.173
You just said it yourself;
this just sort of happened.

07:55.175 --> 07:57.476
So, yes, fine,
you caught me.

07:57.478 --> 07:59.110
I was dating someone else.

07:59.112 --> 08:02.481
But, you know, it was
a little, innocent overlap.

08:02.483 --> 08:04.182
Hah!

08:04.184 --> 08:06.585
Any idea why our victim would

08:06.587 --> 08:07.886
Have your boyfriend's
cell phone?

08:07.888 --> 08:10.222
Ex-boyfriend, and no.

08:10.224 --> 08:12.157
But, you know, I gotta say,

08:12.159 --> 08:14.159
I'm not that surprised
that eddie is mixed up

08:14.161 --> 08:15.227
With some dead guy,
because, um,

08:15.229 --> 08:17.529
I mean, huh, he was, he was fun.

08:17.531 --> 08:19.731
I don't need the details.
But the, yeah,

08:19.733 --> 08:21.166
There was, something
wasn't right.

08:21.168 --> 08:22.834
I kept catching him
in these lies and...

08:22.836 --> 08:26.671
Everybody has
a credit history.
Well, that's enough for me.

08:26.673 --> 08:29.174
Let's go arrest him.
Oh, no. We're gonna
talk to him first.

08:29.176 --> 08:30.909
(sighs) I knew you
were gonna say that.

08:30.911 --> 08:32.077
Mcgee:
Crime scene's locked up.

08:32.079 --> 08:34.179
Thought I'd come by
and se...

08:34.181 --> 08:35.514
Whoa.

08:35.516 --> 08:36.715
Hi, chucky.

08:36.717 --> 08:37.983
What?

08:40.219 --> 08:43.255
So, agent fornell was married
to gibbs's ex-wife?

08:43.257 --> 08:44.222
Yup.

08:44.224 --> 08:45.924
And the owner

08:45.926 --> 08:47.692
Of the second cell phone
from our crime scene

08:47.694 --> 08:49.127
Was dating gibbs's ex-wife?

08:49.129 --> 08:50.862
Yup.
Whew, wow.

08:50.864 --> 08:52.864
That's quite a coincidence.

08:52.866 --> 08:54.866
I know. It really is.

08:54.868 --> 08:56.268
Mcgee: You know,
it's hard to imagine

08:56.270 --> 08:58.937
The same woman liking
fornell and this eddie guy.

08:58.939 --> 09:02.941
Although, maybe diane liked him
because he's not fornell.

09:02.943 --> 09:05.310
Best leave
the psychoanalysis to ducky.

09:09.315 --> 09:11.116
If you value breathing.

09:11.118 --> 09:12.817
Bishop, you
could have warned me.

09:12.819 --> 09:15.053
You said I wasn't
supposed to do that.

09:15.055 --> 09:17.556
Gibbs:
Tobias.
Hey.

09:17.558 --> 09:19.057
What are you doing here?

09:19.059 --> 09:20.325
Just thought you
might need some help.

09:20.327 --> 09:21.893
Diane's really worried,
I just want to

09:21.895 --> 09:23.194
Put her mind at ease.

09:23.196 --> 09:24.829
Yeah, uh-huh.

09:24.831 --> 09:26.064
You shot me in the caboose.

09:26.066 --> 09:27.132
You owe me.

09:27.134 --> 09:28.300
Mcgee.

09:28.302 --> 09:29.334
Go.

09:31.170 --> 09:32.304
Oh.

09:32.306 --> 09:33.271
Okay.

09:36.175 --> 09:37.909
Uh, meet eddie macklin.

09:37.911 --> 09:39.911
Diane sterling's... Boyfriend.

09:39.913 --> 09:40.912
Ex-boyfriend.

09:40.914 --> 09:42.147
He's 31 years old

09:42.149 --> 09:44.082
And works
at a local climbing gym.

09:45.217 --> 09:47.752
Yeah, and...?

09:47.754 --> 09:49.354
And that's it,
we couldn't find anything

09:49.356 --> 09:51.222
Prior to six months ago.

09:51.224 --> 09:53.191
No parking ticket,
library card or bus pass.

09:53.193 --> 09:54.225
Interesting.

09:54.227 --> 09:56.261
Let's go ask him
about it.

10:00.032 --> 10:01.132
(mutters):
God...

10:02.168 --> 10:03.735
Man:
Yeah, I knew him.

10:03.737 --> 10:06.905
He came in about six months ago,
looking for a job.

10:06.907 --> 10:08.373
He teaches our
basic climb class.

10:08.375 --> 10:10.041
Fornell:
Whoa.

10:10.043 --> 10:13.345
His chest is bigger
than diane's.
You know where he is?

10:13.347 --> 10:16.615
No. And he actually
blew off a private
lesson this morning.

10:16.617 --> 10:19.117
But I don't think eddie was
a big fan of the student.

10:19.119 --> 10:20.352
How about this guy?

10:20.354 --> 10:21.319
You know him?

10:23.022 --> 10:24.222
Yeah, that's him.

10:24.224 --> 10:25.790
That's eddie's
student.

10:25.792 --> 10:27.025
Geez, what happened?

10:27.027 --> 10:29.294
Corporal flegman was shot.

10:29.296 --> 10:30.862
We found eddie's
cell phone on him.

10:30.864 --> 10:33.298
We'd like to
talk to him about it.

10:33.300 --> 10:34.366
Among other things.

10:34.368 --> 10:36.301
I knew eddie
was trouble.

10:36.303 --> 10:37.335
Just something off about him.

10:37.337 --> 10:39.204
You know where
we can find him?

10:39.206 --> 10:41.072
I don't know--
his apartment?

10:41.074 --> 10:42.240
Uh, it's empty.

10:42.242 --> 10:44.275
No car registration
with the dmv.

10:44.277 --> 10:46.111
That's weird. He has a car.

10:46.113 --> 10:48.146
I got the info on his
employment application.

10:48.148 --> 10:50.749
Let me get it.
Thanks.

10:50.751 --> 10:54.719
Gibbs:
Yeah, suspect's vehicle is an
'88 silver lincoln town car.

10:54.721 --> 10:55.787
It's a dc plate.

10:55.789 --> 10:57.322
Have bishop run the bolo.

10:57.324 --> 10:58.323
Mcgee: You sure?
Yeah.

10:58.325 --> 10:59.391
On it.

11:00.993 --> 11:02.093
Grab a bite?

11:02.095 --> 11:03.194
I'm good.

11:03.196 --> 11:04.229
Beer?

11:04.231 --> 11:07.298
Long day, tobias.

11:07.300 --> 11:09.434
What the hell am I doing, gibbs?

11:13.673 --> 11:17.008
I feel like I've been swallowed
by a python, cut my way out

11:17.010 --> 11:19.377
And then crawled back
inside again.

11:19.379 --> 11:22.080
Sounds about right.
Oh, come on.

11:22.082 --> 11:23.381
Are we making a mistake?

11:23.383 --> 11:25.850
Depends.
On what?

11:25.852 --> 11:28.053
What are you looking for?

11:28.055 --> 11:29.754
Not just sex, if that's
what you're getting at.

11:29.756 --> 11:31.289
Whoa. Whoa. Stop.
But don't get
me wrong, no,

11:31.291 --> 11:33.391
It's better than...
Just stop.

11:33.393 --> 11:35.393
I'm just saying that there's
something different this time.

11:35.395 --> 11:37.395
Maybe because we're exes.

11:37.397 --> 11:40.331
You should try it. I mean...

11:40.333 --> 11:42.200
With another one
of your ex-wives,

11:42.202 --> 11:44.736
Not this one, 'cause
this one's... Taken.

11:44.738 --> 11:46.971
Can I go home now?

11:46.973 --> 11:49.407
You are... You are the worst
advice-giver I've ever met!

11:49.409 --> 11:51.376
Don't quit your day job.

11:51.378 --> 11:55.814
I think...

11:55.816 --> 11:58.316
As long as you're happy,
that's all that matters.

11:58.318 --> 12:00.452
Happy?

12:00.454 --> 12:02.287
What's that got to do
with anything?

12:02.289 --> 12:04.289
(phone rings)

12:04.291 --> 12:05.757
It's my neighbor.

12:05.759 --> 12:07.292
She watches emily.

12:07.294 --> 12:09.060
What'd she do now?

12:09.062 --> 12:11.196
(woman speaking
indistinctly over phone)

12:11.198 --> 12:12.497
No, I'll go.

12:14.133 --> 12:15.867
She didn't come home
for dinner again.

12:15.869 --> 12:17.302
Third time this week.

12:17.304 --> 12:20.038
I've got to go prowl
the mall looking for her.

12:20.040 --> 12:22.073
Hey.

12:22.075 --> 12:23.475
Rain check?

12:23.477 --> 12:25.877
I can wait.

12:30.382 --> 12:33.251
(cat yowls)

12:33.253 --> 12:35.253
(keys jangle)

12:35.255 --> 12:37.322
(sighs)

12:43.462 --> 12:45.463
No way in hell am I living
with either of them,

12:45.465 --> 12:47.198
If they're back together.

12:47.200 --> 12:49.267
(sighs wearily)

12:58.277 --> 13:01.379
Can I stay one more night
at your house, uncle gibbs?

13:01.381 --> 13:03.381
We can watch
<i>african queen</i> again.

13:03.383 --> 13:05.216
Your parents want you back.

13:05.218 --> 13:07.085
They didn't want me
back last night.

13:07.087 --> 13:08.520
I'm 13-- they'd let me
emigrate to jupiter

13:08.522 --> 13:10.021
If I could get a ride.

13:10.023 --> 13:11.089
(chuckles)

13:11.091 --> 13:13.491
Morning. I entered
eddie macklin's

13:13.493 --> 13:14.959
Vehicle information
into the ncic database,

13:14.961 --> 13:17.262
Along with
a physical description.

13:17.264 --> 13:19.230
Then I sent out copies
to all law enforcement agencies.

13:19.232 --> 13:21.132
And then I-I just felt like...
Bishop.

13:21.134 --> 13:22.867
You can just say "bolo's out."

13:22.869 --> 13:24.302
Uh...

13:24.304 --> 13:26.538
Bolo's out.

13:26.540 --> 13:28.339
He actually told me
you're doing great,

13:28.341 --> 13:30.341
But you need to relax a little.

13:30.343 --> 13:32.010
Can't say I disagree.

13:33.412 --> 13:35.346
Diane:
Emily.
Thank you.

13:35.348 --> 13:37.549
Do you have any idea
what kind of trouble

13:37.551 --> 13:38.516
You are in, missy?

13:38.518 --> 13:40.852
You're the one
who's ruining your life.

13:40.854 --> 13:42.821
I beg your pardon?

13:42.823 --> 13:46.491
Uh, www.You-and-dad-suck-
together.Com?

13:46.493 --> 13:48.493
(gasps)
or are you too desperate
at this point to care?

13:48.495 --> 13:51.129
Apple doesn't fall far
from the tree, huh?

13:51.131 --> 13:53.097
How dare you talk
to me like that.
You and dad

13:53.099 --> 13:54.365
Speak to each other?

13:54.367 --> 13:56.067
All you guys do is fight.

13:56.069 --> 13:57.902
We do not fight.

13:57.904 --> 13:59.537
We are just very loud!

13:59.539 --> 14:01.272
Best let them wear
each other out before I get

14:01.274 --> 14:03.575
Into it.
Emily:
Right. And you!

14:03.577 --> 14:04.542
How could you do this to me?

14:04.544 --> 14:06.044
Honey,

14:06.046 --> 14:08.546
No one is doing anything to you.

14:08.548 --> 14:10.048
Your mother and
I are just...

14:10.050 --> 14:11.282
Wait a second.

14:11.284 --> 14:13.518
How exactly do you know about...

14:13.520 --> 14:14.586
Your mother and me?

14:14.588 --> 14:18.890
I put a keystroke logger
on both your facebook accounts.

14:18.892 --> 14:20.325
You what?!
You need a warrant

14:20.327 --> 14:21.593
To do that!

14:21.595 --> 14:22.393
Gibbs, gibbs, gibbs,

14:22.395 --> 14:24.462
Gibbs, gibbs, gibbs.

14:24.464 --> 14:26.264
I cracked
the suspect's cell phone.

14:26.266 --> 14:28.933
There are boatloads
of juicy texts on there

14:28.935 --> 14:32.003
From him to fornell's ex-wife.

14:32.005 --> 14:34.072
I mean, this stuff is-is kinkier
than <i>fifty shades of grey.</i>

14:34.074 --> 14:37.275
You have got to
come see this...

14:39.411 --> 14:41.145
Fornell.

14:42.348 --> 14:43.481
Ex-wife.

14:43.483 --> 14:45.149
Daughter.

14:46.252 --> 14:47.485
(weak, anxious laugh)

14:47.487 --> 14:48.553
Oops.

14:50.022 --> 14:51.489
You get back here
or I will smash

14:51.491 --> 14:55.026
Every computer in that lab!
Don't you touch my babies!

14:55.028 --> 14:57.195
(sighs)

14:57.197 --> 15:00.031
Can I apply for asylum?

15:03.435 --> 15:05.637
(chuckles) abbs, I hope you
told gibbs to come alone

15:05.639 --> 15:08.206
'cause fornell's head would
explode if he saw these texts.

15:08.208 --> 15:10.375
Better get a mop.
Tony! If you value
your life,

15:10.377 --> 15:11.476
You will turn off
that computer right now!

15:11.478 --> 15:13.411
Touch that cpu and I touch you.

15:13.413 --> 15:14.479
I can't hear you.

15:14.481 --> 15:16.080
I have a sinus
infection.

15:16.082 --> 15:18.116
I have to go get my neti pot.

15:18.118 --> 15:20.551
No, no. Oh...
(grunts)

15:22.621 --> 15:23.588
Hey, what happened?

15:23.590 --> 15:26.591
I'm prepared
for any contingency.

15:26.593 --> 15:28.359
You are interfering
in an ongoing investigation.

15:28.361 --> 15:29.260
Turn that
computer back on.

15:29.262 --> 15:30.561
Diane:
Okay, tobias,

15:30.563 --> 15:32.263
I sent most of those texts
before you and I

15:32.265 --> 15:33.364
Were back together again,

15:33.366 --> 15:35.433
So... They're inadmissible.

15:35.435 --> 15:40.171
That mata hari here sent
after we got our game on.

15:40.173 --> 15:42.974
Let's see how innocent that
innocent overlap really was.

15:42.976 --> 15:45.043
Everybody still alive?
Yes, just wounded.

15:45.045 --> 15:47.445
By betrayal.
Where's emily?

15:47.447 --> 15:49.380
Conference room with bishop.
And she's fine.

15:49.382 --> 15:51.482
You got anything besides
diane's texts?

15:51.484 --> 15:55.453
The suspect, um, sent
a few texts of his own.

15:55.455 --> 15:58.022
He mentioned a safety
deposit box at a local bank.

15:58.024 --> 15:59.657
Who'd he send them to?
A burn phone

15:59.659 --> 16:00.725
With a black market number.

16:00.727 --> 16:03.127
So something is
definitely afoot here.

16:03.129 --> 16:04.662
You got the name of the bank?

16:04.664 --> 16:06.965
Let's go check it out.

16:06.967 --> 16:07.966
Whoa. Slow down.

16:07.968 --> 16:11.536
So she can I.D. Her ex-boyfriend
from the security tapes.

16:11.538 --> 16:13.237
So?
So I'm not

16:13.239 --> 16:15.106
Bringing both of you.

16:20.646 --> 16:23.648
The locksmith is almost finished
with the safe deposit box.

16:23.650 --> 16:26.150
Let me go check
on the security footage.

16:26.152 --> 16:27.685
Would you like something
to drink?

16:27.687 --> 16:29.020
No, I'm good.

16:29.022 --> 16:30.688
I'll take a water.
One straw,

16:30.690 --> 16:33.257
Two pieces of ice,
three slices of lemon.

16:47.740 --> 16:49.741
Jethro, what the hell
am I doing?

16:49.743 --> 16:52.610
I feel like I drove
into a ditch, towed my car out

16:52.612 --> 16:55.013
And then drove
right back in again.

16:55.015 --> 16:57.348
Oh, god, please don't
make me do this.

16:57.350 --> 16:59.117
This is all your fault.

16:59.119 --> 17:01.586
What?
If you hadn't shot tobias
in the ass,

17:01.588 --> 17:03.421
I wouldn't have had
to nurse him back to health.

17:03.423 --> 17:06.624
He was so vulnerable.

17:06.626 --> 17:09.794
You know, his pride
was so wounded and...

17:09.796 --> 17:12.663
Then one night I was
helping him with his bath...
Whoa.

17:12.665 --> 17:14.332
Whoa. Stop.

17:14.334 --> 17:16.734
Stop. What is wrong

17:16.736 --> 17:18.169
With you two?
I just need to know

17:18.171 --> 17:20.438
If you think
we're making a mistake.

17:20.440 --> 17:23.674
It depends. Uh...

17:25.344 --> 17:27.712
What are you... Looking for?

17:27.714 --> 17:30.181
I just want to...

17:30.183 --> 17:32.683
Wake up next to someone I love.

17:32.685 --> 17:35.553
(door opens)
here's mr. Macklin's
safe deposit box

17:35.555 --> 17:37.789
And the security footage.

17:40.793 --> 17:44.062
Thank you.

17:46.732 --> 17:48.733
He rented the box a month ago.

17:48.735 --> 17:51.235
There's been a lot of activity
since then.

17:51.237 --> 17:53.104
Define "a lot."
he's been here

17:53.106 --> 17:55.139
Over ten times
in the last three weeks alone.

17:55.141 --> 17:57.075
Well,

17:57.077 --> 18:00.244
Who stores stationery
in a safe deposit box?

18:00.246 --> 18:03.414
Perhaps he removed the important
contents on his last visit.

18:03.416 --> 18:05.716
Let's see
his last visit.

18:12.157 --> 18:13.658
Oh, that's eddie right there.

18:15.627 --> 18:18.429
He doesn't appear
to be carrying anything.

18:18.431 --> 18:19.297
Who the hell is she?

18:19.299 --> 18:21.232
Looks like a girlfriend.

18:21.234 --> 18:22.333
Girlfriend?

18:23.402 --> 18:24.502
While we were dating?

18:24.504 --> 18:25.503
That two-timing

18:25.505 --> 18:26.737
Son of a...
Hey. Diane.

18:26.739 --> 18:28.706
While you were
dating eddie,

18:28.708 --> 18:30.208
You and fornell were...

18:31.110 --> 18:33.277
Oh... Forget it.

18:33.279 --> 18:34.612
Did she have
to sign in, too?

18:34.614 --> 18:36.447
No, just the box's owner.

18:36.449 --> 18:37.448
Well, we're gonna have
to find her.

18:37.450 --> 18:38.850
We will. Relax.

18:38.852 --> 18:41.152
She's our only lead to eddie.

18:41.154 --> 18:42.887
Ducky:
<i>The bullet fragment</i>

18:42.889 --> 18:46.457
Bounced around the acetabulum,
flew up to the iliac crest...

18:46.459 --> 18:48.292
Before exiting just below
the coccyx. I'm telling you,

18:48.294 --> 18:49.594
Doctor, it's amazing.

18:49.596 --> 18:52.163
Let me guess.
The jfk magic bullet theory?

18:52.165 --> 18:55.199
Oh, ac-actually it's...
Agent fornell's heinie.

18:55.201 --> 18:56.367
Oh.
(chuckles)

18:56.369 --> 18:57.869
Uh, I'm sorry. Uh...

18:57.871 --> 18:59.604
To what do we owe the pleasure?

18:59.606 --> 19:03.307
Ooh. Uh, pleasure, no.
But, uh,

19:03.309 --> 19:05.276
I do need to better
familiarize myself with...

19:05.278 --> 19:08.479
Actual dead people.

19:08.481 --> 19:10.681
Who are dead.

19:10.683 --> 19:12.617
I thought you might
be able to help me.

19:12.619 --> 19:14.619
You've come to the right place.
(chuckles)

19:14.621 --> 19:18.189
Say hello again
to corporal ron flegman.

19:18.191 --> 19:20.258
(exhales)

19:25.631 --> 19:27.198
Hello.

19:27.200 --> 19:31.335
We confirmed that the gunshots
were the cause of death,

19:31.337 --> 19:34.639
But that is really
just the start.

19:34.641 --> 19:36.374
For example,
the, uh...

19:36.376 --> 19:38.643
Postmortem lividity on the body
indicates that the victim

19:38.645 --> 19:40.545
Wasn't moved after the murder.

19:40.547 --> 19:42.547
That-that is...
That is correct.

19:42.549 --> 19:44.682
Uh, however,

19:44.684 --> 19:46.651
The bruise on the front
of his calf there,

19:46.653 --> 19:47.885
It indicates that...

19:47.887 --> 19:51.789
Necrobiosis lipoidica,
I think it's called.

19:52.958 --> 19:55.693
That's also correct.

19:55.695 --> 19:58.396
I took the liberty of reading
the    <i>handbook of autopsy prace</i>

19:58.398 --> 20:00.331
This weekend.
(chuckles)

20:00.333 --> 20:01.966
The whole thing?
(chuckles)

20:01.968 --> 20:03.734
It's-it's over 600 pages.

20:03.736 --> 20:05.369
It was 596, actually.

20:05.371 --> 20:07.338
It was really cool.
(chuckles)

20:07.340 --> 20:09.640
Tony:
âª happy first official
joint duty âª

20:09.642 --> 20:12.476
âª bolo to you.

20:12.478 --> 20:14.679
(chuckles)
it's a very
special moment.

20:14.681 --> 20:16.347
Blow out the candle.
Make a wish.

20:16.349 --> 20:18.683
My bolo on eddie macklin
came in?

20:18.685 --> 20:19.984
Your wish came true.

20:19.986 --> 20:22.353
Ah.
Airport police found his car
in a long-term

20:22.355 --> 20:23.521
Parking facility.

20:23.523 --> 20:25.389
Rock on. Let's go get it.

20:25.391 --> 20:26.824
Mm. We are.

20:26.826 --> 20:27.858
You aren't.

20:27.860 --> 20:29.427
You have
a little appointment

20:29.429 --> 20:30.895
With the polygraph person.

20:30.897 --> 20:32.396
(sighs)
already?

20:32.398 --> 20:33.864
Don't worry. It's gonna be fun.

20:33.866 --> 20:35.433
Polygraphs...

20:35.435 --> 20:37.868
Who doesn't love talking
about themselves?

20:38.804 --> 20:41.339
(sighs)

20:42.307 --> 20:43.441
(clears throat)

20:43.443 --> 20:44.942
I was dropping emily off
at school.

20:44.944 --> 20:48.512
I heard you found
diane's ex-boy-toy's car.

20:48.514 --> 20:50.915
Yeah, he left it in long-term
parking at the airport.

20:50.917 --> 20:53.551
What a pile of junk.

20:53.553 --> 20:55.786
Hath the woman no shame?

20:55.788 --> 20:57.622
Can you believe
he's half her age?

20:57.624 --> 21:00.358
I guess you weren't stallion
enough, chuckie.

21:00.360 --> 21:02.326
Agent fornell,
I swear, we never...

21:02.328 --> 21:04.495
Yeah. Diane told me the
same thing, and I believed her,

21:04.497 --> 21:07.498
Though current circumstances
are throwing a bit of cold water

21:07.500 --> 21:09.000
On her credibility.

21:09.002 --> 21:10.635
You run down the flights
out of the airport?

21:10.637 --> 21:13.037
Yes. There's no
eddie macklin listed.

21:13.039 --> 21:15.506
So why was he parked there?

21:15.508 --> 21:17.508
That's not the half of it.

21:17.510 --> 21:21.912
Not only did we find
a clown nose in the trunk

21:21.914 --> 21:23.547
But we also found
blood on...

21:23.549 --> 21:25.850
Abby. We're supposed to wait
for gibbs to get back.

21:25.852 --> 21:27.585
Oh, right. Never mind.

21:27.587 --> 21:28.919
You found blood in the car?

21:28.921 --> 21:31.555
Minute traces of it everywhere.

21:31.557 --> 21:33.557
We think someone tried
to clean it up.

21:33.559 --> 21:35.660
But I was still able
to detect blood proteins

21:35.662 --> 21:37.995
From at least
four separate victims.

21:37.997 --> 21:39.830
What... You're saying
that diane's ex

21:39.832 --> 21:42.700
Was some kind of serial killer?

21:44.303 --> 21:45.569
(laughs)

21:45.571 --> 21:47.038
That's...

21:57.849 --> 21:58.949
Tony: We interviewed
all the street performers

21:58.951 --> 22:01.852
Where corporal flegman
was killed.

22:01.854 --> 22:03.087
They all had alibis.

22:03.089 --> 22:04.722
And very large shoes.

22:04.724 --> 22:06.824
At the moment,
that leaves

22:06.826 --> 22:08.826
One remaining suspect.
Diane sterling's

22:08.828 --> 22:10.895
Ex-lover, and owner

22:10.897 --> 22:12.997
Of a lincoln with multiple
blood stains in it.

22:12.999 --> 22:15.433
(phone ringing)

22:16.935 --> 22:19.403
What, diane?

22:19.405 --> 22:20.871
Diane:
Well, have you found him yet?

22:20.873 --> 22:22.740
No, we have not
found him yet.

22:22.742 --> 22:24.842
It's the same answer as the last
four times when you called.

22:24.844 --> 22:27.812
(phone beeps off)

22:27.814 --> 22:29.547
We found circumstantial evidence

22:29.549 --> 22:31.582
In this car linking him
to flegman's murder,

22:31.584 --> 22:34.618
But no indication
of his current whereabouts.
(phone ringing)

22:36.688 --> 22:38.723
What, tobias?
Aren't you with diane?

22:38.725 --> 22:40.024
Are you holding anything back?

22:40.026 --> 22:41.892
No, I am not holding
anything back.

22:41.894 --> 22:43.728
I will tell you
when I have something.

22:43.730 --> 22:45.363
(over phone):
Fine.

22:45.365 --> 22:47.665
Oh, I can't believe I was
so worried about that polygraph.

22:47.667 --> 22:49.133
I mean, at nsa,
they ask you everything.

22:49.135 --> 22:52.636
As in, like, everything.

22:52.638 --> 22:53.971
I'm surprised you
guys don't have,

22:53.973 --> 22:56.941
Like, more personnel
issues with how...

22:57.843 --> 22:59.810
I am interrupting something.

22:59.812 --> 23:02.113
(phone ringing)
do you want me to leave?

23:02.115 --> 23:04.782
(ringing continues)

23:06.618 --> 23:07.785
(ringing slows and stops)

23:07.787 --> 23:09.854
No. I want you to work.

23:14.059 --> 23:16.527
That means we tell him
what we know.

23:16.529 --> 23:18.863
Oh. So far, no luck
using facial recognition

23:18.865 --> 23:20.064
To track our
mystery woman.

23:20.066 --> 23:21.766
I'm still working on it.

23:21.768 --> 23:23.134
And abby hasn't
gotten any hits

23:23.136 --> 23:25.503
On the blood samples
we found in eddie's car.

23:25.505 --> 23:26.871
Total is five individuals.

23:26.873 --> 23:28.606
All right, expand the bolo.

23:28.608 --> 23:29.807
I want this guy's photo

23:29.809 --> 23:32.810
In every train station,
in every bus station.

23:32.812 --> 23:34.612
That's a bad idea.

23:34.614 --> 23:35.946
(mutters):
Uh-oh...

23:37.749 --> 23:40.885
I mean...
I might have a better idea.

23:40.887 --> 23:42.853
Look, eddie is
coming back.

23:42.855 --> 23:44.955
If he was ditching his car,
there are easier places

23:44.957 --> 23:46.924
To abandon it
than at an airport.

23:47.926 --> 23:49.894
We should put it back
and watch it,

23:49.896 --> 23:51.162
And when he comes
to pick it up...

23:51.164 --> 23:52.797
We grab him.

23:52.799 --> 23:55.433
Absolutely not.

23:55.435 --> 23:57.835
We follow him,
see what he does,

23:57.837 --> 24:00.838
Where he goes,
then we grab him.

24:04.843 --> 24:06.944
Works for me.

24:06.946 --> 24:08.546
I got the first shift.

24:08.548 --> 24:10.214
Don't tell anybody where I am.

24:24.563 --> 24:26.630
(dog barking)

24:27.899 --> 24:29.834
(door opening)

24:29.836 --> 24:31.969
(footsteps)

24:33.772 --> 24:35.973
(floorboards creaking)

24:40.579 --> 24:42.146
(gun cocks)

24:42.148 --> 24:44.548
(footsteps approaching)

24:47.552 --> 24:48.986
Hey.
(screams)
oh!

24:48.988 --> 24:52.490
Why do you always
go for the gun?

24:52.492 --> 24:54.925
What are you doing here?
(sighs)

24:54.927 --> 24:56.961
Well, don't worry,
I'm not gonna stay.

24:56.963 --> 24:59.196
I know.
It wasn't the question.

24:59.198 --> 25:02.900
Tobias and I had a family
dinner planned with emily,

25:02.902 --> 25:04.902
And she left us a message,
saying she had other plans,

25:04.904 --> 25:06.704
So I thought maybe
she'd come back here.

25:06.706 --> 25:09.206
Try the mall.

25:09.208 --> 25:11.976
Yes, that's where
I'm going right now, thank you.

25:11.978 --> 25:13.978
I will let you know.

25:13.980 --> 25:16.947
I hope you and your gun
have fun together.

25:17.849 --> 25:19.917
(cat yowling)

25:19.919 --> 25:22.019
(sighs)

25:23.021 --> 25:24.922
(upbeat ringtone playing)

25:24.924 --> 25:26.991
(cat meowing
sound effect plays)

25:28.894 --> 25:30.928
(closet door creaks open)

25:30.930 --> 25:34.031
Can't believe she missed me.

25:34.033 --> 25:36.934
Who doesn't check the closet
when they're clearing a house?

25:36.936 --> 25:38.969
Who doesn't turn
off their cell phone

25:38.971 --> 25:40.237
When they're hiding
in a closet?

25:40.239 --> 25:41.839
Wasn't my cell phone.

25:41.841 --> 25:44.074
I forgot I set my happy cat
friend alert watch

25:44.076 --> 25:45.876
To let me know
when the <i>columbo</i> marathon

25:45.878 --> 25:47.077
Started tonight.

25:47.079 --> 25:48.779
Have to tell your mom.
She's worried.

25:48.781 --> 25:51.549
I know. I know.
Just give me two minutes.

25:51.551 --> 25:53.584
I need your help.

26:01.326 --> 26:04.094
All right, what do you need?

26:04.096 --> 26:08.032
I want you to help me convince
my parents to break up.

26:08.034 --> 26:10.568
They listen to you.

26:10.570 --> 26:12.202
And you know they aren't
right for each other.

26:12.204 --> 26:13.804
You've seen them fight.

26:13.806 --> 26:15.172
They fighting a lot?

26:15.174 --> 26:17.074
In public, yeah.

26:17.076 --> 26:19.176
It's like they have
a fetish for it.

26:19.178 --> 26:22.746
But... When it's
just the three of us,

26:22.748 --> 26:25.049
It's not so bad, I guess.

26:25.051 --> 26:27.585
But you know this
will end badly.

26:27.587 --> 26:30.821
Well, yeah, it might.

26:30.823 --> 26:34.291
Then I get to watch them
break up all over again.

26:34.293 --> 26:36.126
Oh, I... I'm confused.

26:36.128 --> 26:38.028
You-you-you don't
want them together?

26:38.030 --> 26:41.999
Or you're scared that
they're gonna break up again?

26:42.001 --> 26:43.334
Why would I be
scared of that?

26:43.336 --> 26:44.935
It's what I want!

26:44.937 --> 26:46.804
Uh...
Wait.

26:46.806 --> 26:48.005
Now <i>I'm</i> confused.

26:48.007 --> 26:50.107
You suck at this!

26:50.109 --> 26:51.642
(phone ringing)

26:51.644 --> 26:53.143
(laughs)

26:54.746 --> 26:56.380
Yeah, it's gibbs.

26:56.382 --> 26:58.082
Tony:
Bishop and I are at the airport.

26:58.084 --> 26:59.316
Eddie's back.
He picked up his car.

26:59.318 --> 27:00.884
We're tailing him now.

27:00.886 --> 27:02.820
Yeah, stay with it.
Let me know.

27:02.822 --> 27:03.988
Will do.

27:03.990 --> 27:06.056
Two minutes are up, kid.

27:06.058 --> 27:08.092
Let's get you home.

27:11.296 --> 27:13.130
Give me a sit-rep.

27:13.132 --> 27:14.832
Eddie drove all night.

27:14.834 --> 27:16.133
I think he was trying to
see if he had a tail.

27:16.135 --> 27:17.768
He finally came here,
parked his car

27:17.770 --> 27:19.236
And disappeared.

27:19.238 --> 27:20.938
Mcgee:
Fornell's covering the rear.

27:20.940 --> 27:22.172
Okay. Dinozzo, you're with me.

27:22.174 --> 27:25.142
Mcgee, bishop,
you got the exit.

27:36.821 --> 27:38.822
We're clear.

27:39.991 --> 27:42.359
Looks like hannibal lecter's
little hobby center.

27:45.196 --> 27:46.196
Boss.

27:52.771 --> 27:53.771
I got this.

27:55.006 --> 27:56.173
(panting)

27:56.175 --> 27:58.909
(panting)

27:58.911 --> 28:01.045
Tony:
Hey! Ncis.

28:01.047 --> 28:03.914
Get on the ground,
put your hands on your head!

28:05.417 --> 28:07.351
(grunting)

28:08.687 --> 28:09.953
Where do you think you're going?

28:09.955 --> 28:11.355
(grunting)

28:14.693 --> 28:15.926
Oh, come on.

28:19.130 --> 28:20.798
(grunts)

28:22.734 --> 28:24.234
(grunts)

28:24.236 --> 28:27.304
Senior fbi agent tobias fornell.

28:27.306 --> 28:30.240
I believe you know my wife.

28:30.242 --> 28:33.410
(door opens)

28:33.412 --> 28:35.913
Is he gonna hit me again?

28:35.915 --> 28:39.750
No. And...

28:39.752 --> 28:41.085
And I apologize for that.

28:41.087 --> 28:43.053
We just really needed
to talk to you.

28:43.055 --> 28:46.323
Yeah, about what?

28:53.098 --> 28:55.232
Aren't you gonna ask
what happened?

28:55.234 --> 28:57.101
Flegman was a student of yours.

28:57.103 --> 28:59.069
What happened?

28:59.071 --> 29:01.305
You slept with my wife!

29:03.274 --> 29:06.210
What happened...
Was that...

29:06.212 --> 29:09.913
Your student was murdered...
With your cell phone on him.

29:09.915 --> 29:11.281
And then
you disappeared.

29:11.283 --> 29:12.750
Gibbs:
Why is your car

29:12.752 --> 29:14.451
Covered with blood?

29:14.453 --> 29:17.020
And what's with that little shop
of horrors we found you in?

29:17.022 --> 29:18.422
Oh, that storage unit--
that ain't mine, bro.

29:18.424 --> 29:20.124
Oh, I suppose
this isn't yours, either.

29:20.126 --> 29:22.860
We found 20 more of those
hidden in the storage unit.

29:22.862 --> 29:24.461
That's almost
100 grand.

29:24.463 --> 29:26.296
It's a lot of cash
for a gym teacher.

29:26.298 --> 29:28.432
I need to get out of here.

29:28.434 --> 29:31.535
Now. If he thinks
I took off with his money...

29:31.537 --> 29:33.170
Who?

29:33.172 --> 29:35.172
(sighs)

29:35.174 --> 29:37.107
You ain't arrested me.

29:37.109 --> 29:40.144
Everything you got
is circumstantial.

29:40.146 --> 29:43.113
So some people
cut their fingers in my car.

29:43.115 --> 29:46.316
You got any bodies,
aside from this loser

29:46.318 --> 29:49.419
Who took the wrong cell phone
at the gym?

29:49.421 --> 29:51.021
I know my rights, man.

29:51.023 --> 29:53.290
You got to arrest me
or let me go.

29:53.292 --> 29:56.794
What's it
gonna be, fellas?

29:56.796 --> 29:58.428
Yeah, that's what
I thought, too.

29:58.430 --> 30:00.264
Whoa, hold on. Hey!
Hey!

30:05.203 --> 30:06.904
(scoffs)
what is that?

30:10.141 --> 30:13.243
Arrest it is.
Our forensic tech

30:13.245 --> 30:15.145
Traced the blood
in your car to an unsolved

30:15.147 --> 30:17.314
Quintuple homicide.

30:17.316 --> 30:20.484
So, sit down,
you walking midlife crisis!

30:20.486 --> 30:23.053
This is nuts, man!
I didn't kill anybody!

30:23.055 --> 30:25.355
That blood is
ten years old!

30:25.357 --> 30:27.057
The car's from a police impound!

30:27.059 --> 30:29.126
So how are you driving it?

30:36.835 --> 30:38.969
'cause my name
isn't eddie macklin.

30:40.338 --> 30:42.239
It's special agent
edward mckenzie.

30:42.241 --> 30:43.974
I work for the secret service.

30:43.976 --> 30:48.412
And you two are about to blow a
highly-classified six-month op.

30:50.448 --> 30:52.349
Our financial crimes division

30:52.351 --> 30:53.951
Has been working
a money-laundering case

30:53.953 --> 30:55.552
For over year.

30:55.554 --> 30:58.222
We traced one of the sources
of the cash to the tower gym.

30:58.224 --> 30:59.556
I went in undercover.

30:59.558 --> 31:01.158
Found out the cash came

31:01.160 --> 31:03.026
From a bank-robbery gang
run by the owner,

31:03.028 --> 31:05.562
Elijah banner,
and his girlfriend.

31:05.564 --> 31:07.431
There's our mystery
woman from the bank.

31:07.433 --> 31:09.499
Elijah told me to rent
a safe deposit box there

31:09.501 --> 31:10.934
So she and I could case
the place.

31:10.936 --> 31:12.236
Oh, were you
casing her, too?

31:12.238 --> 31:15.906
Boss, she's like a cat.
When she found out...

31:15.908 --> 31:17.241
Hello, diane.

31:17.243 --> 31:19.309
Oh, I heard we broke up.

31:19.311 --> 31:20.577
Sorry about that.

31:20.579 --> 31:22.412
Oh, and I'm
a secret service agent.

31:22.414 --> 31:24.514
I heard.
What's with the attitude?

31:24.516 --> 31:26.250
I don't know.
Maybe it's, you were sleeping...

31:26.252 --> 31:28.151
Hey.
...With your ex-husband
while we were dating.

31:28.153 --> 31:29.319
Hey.

31:29.321 --> 31:31.288
Man has a point.

31:31.290 --> 31:32.289
(scoffs):
Oh...

31:32.291 --> 31:34.057
You guys are buddies now?

31:34.059 --> 31:36.960
Yeah. We were thinking
of starting a club.

31:36.962 --> 31:39.062
(laughs)
yeah?

31:39.064 --> 31:40.931
Well, watch it, boys.

31:40.933 --> 31:44.034
I know something
about each and every one of you

31:44.036 --> 31:46.169
That you don't want
anybody else to know.

31:47.272 --> 31:49.673
And I got a twitter account.

31:49.675 --> 31:51.341
We need to get
back to work.

31:51.343 --> 31:52.509
Uh...

31:52.511 --> 31:54.344
Hey, let go of me!

31:54.346 --> 31:55.545
Tony: Come on!
You take your
hands off me

31:55.547 --> 31:57.047
Right now!
Sorry.

31:57.049 --> 31:58.982
(gibbs chuckles)

31:58.984 --> 32:01.385
Well... (laughs)

32:01.387 --> 32:04.388
So, how was corporal flegman
involved?

32:04.390 --> 32:06.089
Flegman drove the getaway car,

32:06.091 --> 32:08.125
But elijah thought
he was skimming.

32:08.127 --> 32:10.360
Looks like elijah
finally did something about it.

32:10.362 --> 32:11.561
Why haven't you taken
this guy down?

32:11.563 --> 32:12.996
He keeps his
hands too clean.

32:12.998 --> 32:14.398
We need to catch
him in the act.

32:14.400 --> 32:16.233
When you picked me up,

32:16.235 --> 32:17.601
I was collecting gear
for his next robbery.

32:17.603 --> 32:19.937
But if elijah thinks
I took off with his money,

32:19.939 --> 32:21.471
Six months
of work goes down the drain.

32:21.473 --> 32:23.307
We can get him
for flegman's murder.

32:23.309 --> 32:25.409
No way he pulled
the trigger.

32:25.411 --> 32:27.010
I'm guessing
it was his girlfriend.

32:27.012 --> 32:29.413
She's the clown.
Freelances at kids' parties.

32:29.415 --> 32:31.581
We want to get this guy,
we need to put the money back,

32:31.583 --> 32:33.650
And I need to get back
on the street

32:33.652 --> 32:35.252
Before he notices I'm gone.

32:35.254 --> 32:37.521
(phone ringing)

32:40.425 --> 32:42.659
It's elijah.

32:42.661 --> 32:45.095
He's noticed.

32:45.097 --> 32:46.096
I got to answer it.

32:46.098 --> 32:48.465
Yeah, put it on speaker.

32:48.467 --> 32:52.102
Yo, e, what's
the word, man?

32:52.104 --> 32:54.137
Cut the bull,
I know you got pinched.

32:54.139 --> 32:57.207
Put agent fornell on the line.

33:02.580 --> 33:04.348
Agent fornell.

33:04.350 --> 33:07.484
You got something of mine.
I got something of yours.

33:07.486 --> 33:10.520
Emily: Dad, I'm in a white van,
no windows, I can smell pine...

33:10.522 --> 33:14.992
Banner: You ever want to see
your daughter again,

33:14.994 --> 33:16.493
You give me back my money.

33:16.495 --> 33:17.494
I'll be in touch.

33:17.496 --> 33:18.562
(hangs up)

33:27.572 --> 33:29.639
I sent everybody,
every asset we have.

33:29.641 --> 33:33.310
Mcgee:
We found a camera hidden
in the storage locker.

33:33.312 --> 33:34.745
Must be how elijah
knew we had his money.

33:34.747 --> 33:36.413
He watched us
collect the evidence.

33:36.415 --> 33:38.281
We need to be ready
when he calls.

33:38.283 --> 33:40.784
I have friends standing by
to help trace the callback.

33:40.786 --> 33:44.054
Right. His apartment's been
cleaned out, he's running.

33:44.056 --> 33:45.222
Any word on the bolo?

33:45.224 --> 33:46.323
Police are
stopping every

33:46.325 --> 33:48.125
Windowless white van
they see.

33:48.127 --> 33:49.326
Your daughter
was very brave.

33:49.328 --> 33:51.328
They found a broken
window in the kitchen.

33:51.330 --> 33:53.030
He was in
our house.

33:53.032 --> 33:55.198
It's gonna be,
it's okay, babe.

33:55.200 --> 33:57.034
Okay.
It's okay.

33:57.036 --> 33:58.035
(phone rings)

33:58.037 --> 33:59.669
Emily's gonna
be all right.

33:59.671 --> 34:00.804
Dinozzo, what do you got?

34:00.806 --> 34:02.672
Elijah's girlfriend is dead.

34:02.674 --> 34:04.808
Looks like he's
tying up loose ends.

34:04.810 --> 34:06.443
You got any idea
where he's going?

34:06.445 --> 34:07.811
Well, no,

34:07.813 --> 34:09.780
But he's not improvising.

34:09.782 --> 34:12.149
We found surveillance photos
of fornell and emily.

34:12.151 --> 34:14.484
Macklin:
Elijah probably started making
exit plans the moment

34:14.486 --> 34:16.119
You two showed up at his studio.

34:16.121 --> 34:17.821
Zeroed in on your daughter
as a lever he could pull.

34:17.823 --> 34:19.723
(phone ringing)

34:19.725 --> 34:21.291
Blocked call.

34:21.293 --> 34:22.592
Tony, keep
us posted.

34:22.594 --> 34:23.460
Will do.

34:26.798 --> 34:28.331
Agent fornell.

34:28.333 --> 34:29.833
Banner:
I just texted you my location.

34:29.835 --> 34:31.535
I want you to send that girl.

34:31.537 --> 34:33.103
The one who
helped you clear out

34:33.105 --> 34:34.604
My storage locker.

34:34.606 --> 34:36.273
She's got eight
minutes to bring me

34:36.275 --> 34:38.775
My money, by herself.

34:38.777 --> 34:41.344
Once I'm safely away, I'll
tell you where you daughter is.

34:41.346 --> 34:43.747
She's fine.
But if you even think

34:43.749 --> 34:45.415
Of sending anyone else,
I'll know.

34:45.417 --> 34:48.285
And your daughter
will pay the price.

34:48.287 --> 34:49.653
Okay.

34:49.655 --> 34:53.290
Okay, but just so we're
on the same page:

34:53.292 --> 34:56.093
If so much as touch a hair
on my daughter's head,

34:56.095 --> 34:57.761
So help me god, I will find you.

34:57.763 --> 35:00.130
And I will rip
your eyes out of your face

35:00.132 --> 35:02.132
And shove them
so far down your throat

35:02.134 --> 35:04.301
You'll need a proctologist
to read the evening paper.

35:04.303 --> 35:05.469
(hangs up)

35:05.471 --> 35:06.703
Fornell:
He hung up.

35:06.705 --> 35:08.138
What's the move, boss?

35:09.640 --> 35:12.109
No, this is your call, tobias.

35:15.413 --> 35:17.147
Bishop, you're the analyst.

35:19.283 --> 35:23.120
Is he gonna let my daughter go
if we give him his money?

35:25.823 --> 35:27.157
Yes. He's demonstrated...

35:27.159 --> 35:28.892
I've got it.

35:28.894 --> 35:33.330
I just need to know
if you are up for this.

35:36.501 --> 35:38.668
Yes.

35:40.738 --> 35:42.873
Then we give him
his money. Gibbs?

35:42.875 --> 35:44.241
No tricks.

35:44.243 --> 35:46.343
You can catch him later.

35:46.345 --> 35:48.445
We just want
our daughter back.

35:55.219 --> 35:56.686
Comm check.

35:56.688 --> 35:58.688
Yeah, we read you.

35:58.690 --> 36:00.257
How you doing, bishop?

36:00.259 --> 36:02.192
I'm fine, surprisingly.

36:02.194 --> 36:04.828
Tell agent fornell
I can do this.

36:04.830 --> 36:07.230
Mcgee:
He's in the conference room
with diane, but, will do.

36:07.232 --> 36:09.666
Okay, so...

36:09.668 --> 36:11.835
I guess I just
sit somewhere and wait?

36:11.837 --> 36:13.336
No, keep moving.

36:13.338 --> 36:15.205
Avoid a static
blind spot.

36:15.207 --> 36:17.941
You don't want him
sneaking up on you.

36:17.943 --> 36:20.343
Okay, less fine now.

36:22.446 --> 36:24.948
Wait, I see
something.

36:24.950 --> 36:26.917
There's a jogger approaching.

36:26.919 --> 36:28.218
Right build.

36:29.387 --> 36:30.887
It's him, no white van.

36:35.960 --> 36:37.360
All right.

36:37.362 --> 36:39.229
Dump the cash
in here.
Okay.

36:39.931 --> 36:41.631
Where's emily?

36:45.937 --> 36:48.305
Take this.
Okay.

36:49.273 --> 36:51.441
Wait here.
Okay.

36:51.443 --> 36:53.476
When I'm clear,
I'll call you with
emily's location.

36:55.413 --> 36:56.646
That was the deal.

36:56.648 --> 36:57.914
Okay.

37:00.484 --> 37:01.751
It's done.

37:05.623 --> 37:06.957
I've lost sight of him.

37:06.959 --> 37:08.491
But he gave me a cell phone,

37:08.493 --> 37:09.960
Said he was gonna call
with emily's location.

37:09.962 --> 37:11.628
Any way to find out
where that cell's been?

37:11.630 --> 37:14.397
We can run its imei number.

37:14.399 --> 37:17.267
Right. If we find out where
it's been, we might be able

37:17.269 --> 37:19.336
To figure out where he's going.
Yeah, do it.

37:19.338 --> 37:21.805
Okay, uh, it'll
just take a minute.

37:38.889 --> 37:39.990
(feedback whines)

37:39.992 --> 37:41.024
Aah, what was
that noise?

37:41.026 --> 37:42.792
I don't know.

37:44.562 --> 37:45.662
Give me a sit-rep.

37:45.664 --> 37:47.364
Okay.

37:47.366 --> 37:50.033
Okay, this doesn't
make any sense.

37:50.035 --> 37:53.303
There's no upside
to killing her.

37:53.305 --> 37:55.505
He's made all the right
moves, so far.

37:55.507 --> 37:57.641
(sighs)

37:57.643 --> 37:59.909
So what's the play?

37:59.911 --> 38:01.978
He can't use the white van
to get away--

38:01.980 --> 38:03.680
Emily's description
made sure of that.

38:03.682 --> 38:05.015
Bishop, report.

38:06.951 --> 38:10.320
Okay, he doesn't
want to risk calling.

38:10.322 --> 38:12.589
But he has to know
if emily isn't found asap,

38:12.591 --> 38:14.758
He's looking at an amber alert.

38:14.760 --> 38:16.793
Then he'll never get away.

38:17.728 --> 38:19.029
(exhales)

38:19.031 --> 38:21.431
So, how does she get found?

38:21.433 --> 38:23.400
(tow truck beeping)

38:26.070 --> 38:28.071
He painted the van.

38:28.073 --> 38:29.873
Damn it.

38:34.612 --> 38:35.912
Wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait!

38:42.420 --> 38:43.386
(whimpering)

38:46.624 --> 38:47.824
You okay?

38:47.826 --> 38:49.092
Mm-hmm.

38:52.797 --> 38:54.331
Okay, you're okay.

38:54.333 --> 38:57.100
You're okay. I'm gonna
get you out of here, okay?

38:57.102 --> 38:58.735
Hang on.

39:00.371 --> 39:01.638
(bell dings)

39:02.606 --> 39:03.740
Dad.
Oh.

39:03.742 --> 39:05.075
Mom.

39:05.077 --> 39:08.111
(applause)
diane: I'm so glad
you're all right.

39:08.113 --> 39:09.512
I love you.

39:13.451 --> 39:15.085
Diane:
I was so worried about you.

39:15.087 --> 39:16.486
Nice work.

39:16.488 --> 39:18.922
Thanks.
Yeah.

39:18.924 --> 39:21.591
Next time you take your
earwig out of your ear,

39:21.593 --> 39:23.126
Bishop...

39:23.128 --> 39:24.861
I'm gonna use a staple gun.

39:24.863 --> 39:26.062
(hits stapler)

39:26.064 --> 39:27.630
Yeah, uh, I was worried

39:27.632 --> 39:29.499
If the fornells found out
about the cell phone...

39:29.501 --> 39:31.401
Yeah. Yeah, I know.

39:32.370 --> 39:33.970
Like I said...

39:33.972 --> 39:35.138
Nice work.

39:36.140 --> 39:37.507
Thanks.

39:38.843 --> 39:39.976
Fornell:
I need another hug.

39:39.978 --> 39:41.444
(emily laughs)

39:41.446 --> 39:44.147
I am so proud
of you, baby.
Oh, I am, too.

39:44.149 --> 39:46.583
Fornell: Are you really okay?
Emily: I'm fine.
He didn't hurt me.

39:46.585 --> 39:49.419
I was just so worried about
you guys-- are-are you okay?

39:49.421 --> 39:51.454
Oh, yeah, we're...
Oh, oh, yeah.

39:51.456 --> 39:53.723
We're just so happy that
we're all together again.

39:56.160 --> 39:57.927
And we-we're just so glad
that-that you're safe

39:57.929 --> 39:59.629
And you're back.

40:04.935 --> 40:06.703
Hey, any word?

40:06.705 --> 40:08.605
Nothing. No sign
at the airports

40:08.607 --> 40:11.841
Talking to highway patrol,
but I got a sinking feeling

40:11.843 --> 40:13.176
He got away.

40:13.178 --> 40:14.577
(chuckles): Oh,
he didn't get away.

40:16.147 --> 40:18.882
My last name is
fornell, after all.

40:24.155 --> 40:27.157
(engine stops)

40:27.159 --> 40:29.025
(car approaches)

40:29.027 --> 40:31.194
(tires squeal)

40:31.196 --> 40:33.530
(car door opens, closes)

40:33.532 --> 40:35.698
Freeze.

40:35.700 --> 40:37.634
You're under
arrest.

40:37.636 --> 40:39.469
No. Move...

40:39.471 --> 40:40.837
So I can shoot you.

40:41.972 --> 40:43.840
I'm not carrying a cell.

40:43.842 --> 40:46.009
This bike's untraceable.
How'd you find me?

40:47.545 --> 40:48.978
(ringtone and cat meowing
sound effect playing)

40:48.980 --> 40:50.447
We didn't.

40:51.215 --> 40:52.649
My daughter did.

40:52.651 --> 40:54.217
Say hello...

40:54.219 --> 40:56.085
To her happy cat
"friend alert" watch.

40:56.087 --> 40:57.454
Mcgee:
It's bluetooth enabled.

40:57.456 --> 40:58.655
It beeps any
time a friend

40:58.657 --> 41:01.458
Wearing the same watch
gets within 30 feet.

41:01.460 --> 41:04.194
Course, I had to boost
the range on the second watch

41:04.196 --> 41:05.228
To track you, but...

41:05.230 --> 41:06.463
That little bitch.

41:06.465 --> 41:09.132
Watch your mouth.

41:09.134 --> 41:12.469
And agent gibbs already
has enough paperwork.

41:12.471 --> 41:14.537
I should have never
let her go.

41:14.539 --> 41:16.539
I'm sorry, gibbs.

41:20.678 --> 41:24.214
It's okay.

41:33.791 --> 41:35.558
(sighs)

41:40.898 --> 41:42.031
Hi.

41:47.571 --> 41:48.505
Eh, told you he'd run.

41:48.507 --> 41:49.939
Fornell:
Hey! Hey, hey.

41:50.808 --> 41:51.975
Come on.

41:51.977 --> 41:53.710
We just came to say
thank you.

41:55.980 --> 41:57.247
You already said thank you.

41:57.249 --> 41:59.616
This time we
brought liquor.

41:59.618 --> 42:02.151
Well, then, you're welcome.

42:02.153 --> 42:03.152
And...

42:03.154 --> 42:04.954
And we have a request.

42:04.956 --> 42:06.656
Oh, I can't wait.

42:06.658 --> 42:08.157
Oh, will you stop
with your whining?

42:08.159 --> 42:09.893
I mean, you're a grown man.

42:09.895 --> 42:12.529
It-it's, it's unattractive.
Fornell:
What are you doing?

42:12.531 --> 42:14.697
We're here to ask a favor
and you're insulting the man.

42:14.699 --> 42:16.132
He has been carrying on
like he lost his dolly.

42:16.134 --> 42:17.800
He hasn't said five words
since he's got here.

42:17.802 --> 42:19.102
Oh...

42:19.104 --> 42:21.604
Fornell: Anyway, we'll be
out of your hair

42:21.606 --> 42:23.206
In a minute.

42:23.208 --> 42:24.307
It's just...

42:24.309 --> 42:28.711
Well, uh, you've probably
noticed that...

42:28.713 --> 42:29.879
Tobias and I--

42:29.881 --> 42:31.981
Clearly gluttons
for punishment--

42:31.983 --> 42:35.018
Are trying to make
a second go of things.

42:35.020 --> 42:36.085
And, uh, we...

42:38.088 --> 42:39.322
Fornell:
We, um...

42:39.324 --> 42:40.790
We...

42:40.792 --> 42:42.659
Oh, for pete's sake.

42:42.661 --> 42:44.561
We want your blessing.

42:44.563 --> 42:46.129
My what?

42:46.131 --> 42:48.264
Your blessing.

42:48.266 --> 42:50.033
It's very important
to diane.

42:50.035 --> 42:51.334
And me.

42:51.336 --> 42:54.103
That we have
your blessing.

42:54.105 --> 42:56.005
Why?

42:56.007 --> 42:58.107
Because it-it...

42:58.109 --> 42:59.242
What is with
the 50 questions,

42:59.244 --> 43:02.011
Do we have it or not?
