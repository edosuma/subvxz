WEBVTT

00:00.022 --> 00:01.421
I want your body
one last time

00:01.457 --> 00:03.023
<i>before I walk down that aisle.</i>

00:03.058 --> 00:04.691
Sheila's getting married,

00:04.727 --> 00:06.727
and she wants to have
one last fling.

00:06.762 --> 00:07.828
Whatever you decide,

00:07.863 --> 00:10.030
it's not going to change
how I feel about you.

00:10.065 --> 00:11.109
You knew I was
seeing someone,

00:11.133 --> 00:12.766
and you did that to me anyway.

00:12.801 --> 00:14.112
If it didn't affect you,
then just go ahead

00:14.136 --> 00:15.536
and tell her you
didn't do anything.

00:15.571 --> 00:16.537
Don't you get it?

00:16.572 --> 00:17.572
You made me the one thing

00:17.606 --> 00:18.939
I never wanted to be.

00:18.974 --> 00:20.741
It was a kiss, Harvey!

00:20.776 --> 00:22.509
We've done more than that.

00:22.545 --> 00:24.523
Unless, of course, you haven't
told her that, either?

00:24.547 --> 00:26.680
The other night, when you
said that you were surprised

00:26.715 --> 00:29.883
that nothing had ever happened
between me and Donna before,

00:29.919 --> 00:31.552
I should've said something.

00:31.587 --> 00:33.787
It was years ago,
and it was only one time,

00:33.822 --> 00:35.856
but Donna and I slept together.

00:35.891 --> 00:39.459
Say something.

00:45.401 --> 00:47.434
<i>Say something, please, Paula.
- Okay.</i>

00:47.469 --> 00:48.613
You want me to say something?

00:48.637 --> 00:49.603
This is the second time

00:49.638 --> 00:51.705
that you haven't told me
the full truth

00:51.740 --> 00:53.574
in as many conversations.

00:53.609 --> 00:54.975
That's not fair,
and you know it.

00:55.010 --> 00:56.655
No, you are not the one
who should be deciding

00:56.679 --> 00:58.712
what is fair
and what's not fair right now.

00:58.747 --> 01:00.447
<i>What's that supposed
to mean?</i>

01:00.482 --> 01:01.626
<i>It means that you want me</i>
<i>to yell at you</i>

01:01.650 --> 01:02.449
<i>so that you can get past this.</i>

01:02.484 --> 01:04.483
<i>Well, I'm not past it,</i>

01:04.519 --> 01:05.964
<i>and right now, what I need</i>
<i>is some time to myself.</i>

01:05.988 --> 01:06.720
Paula, please.

01:06.755 --> 01:07.988
No.
If you can't put

01:08.023 --> 01:09.089
my need to process

01:09.124 --> 01:10.223
over your need to feel okay

01:10.259 --> 01:11.725
about yourself...

01:11.760 --> 01:14.061
then I'm afraid
we'll never get past this.

01:15.598 --> 01:16.608
<i>What's the matter with you?</i>

01:16.632 --> 01:17.598
Put your goddamn weight

01:17.633 --> 01:18.599
into the punches.

01:18.634 --> 01:19.566
Let's go.

01:23.439 --> 01:24.679
I said hit me like you mean it.

01:26.000 --> 01:32.074

01:49.131 --> 01:52.099
<i>Louis,</i>
<i>this is your safe place.</i>

01:52.134 --> 01:53.767
<i>You feel dirty,</i>

01:53.802 --> 01:56.470
<i>but soon,</i>
<i>your mind and your body</i>

01:56.505 --> 01:59.773
<i>will be as pure as snow.</i>

01:59.808 --> 02:02.542
<i>Let the mud</i>
<i>wash away your troubles</i>

02:02.578 --> 02:04.211
<i>as it enters your pores.</i>

02:04.246 --> 02:06.446
<i>It is not an intrusion.</i>

02:06.482 --> 02:08.882
<i>It is a cleansing,</i>
<i>wonderful--</i>

02:08.917 --> 02:10.116
God damn it, Ricardo.

02:10.151 --> 02:12.152
I told you to not
interrupt me--

02:12.187 --> 02:14.488
Sheila.

02:14.523 --> 02:15.800
What are you doing here?
- Louis,

02:15.824 --> 02:16.723
ever since the other night,

02:16.759 --> 02:17.524
I've been wrestling
with whether

02:17.559 --> 02:18.992
I made the right decision.

02:19.028 --> 02:20.160
So have I,

02:20.195 --> 02:20.961
but I don't--
I don't think that--

02:20.996 --> 02:22.162
Then we're in agreement,

02:22.197 --> 02:23.630
which means we can do it

02:23.666 --> 02:27.200
again and again

02:27.236 --> 02:30.470
and again--Ah!
- Oh, mommy.

02:30.506 --> 02:31.972
And again.

02:32.007 --> 02:33.206
And Ag--
- Wait a second.

02:33.242 --> 02:34.519
Wait a second, wait a second,
Sheila.

02:34.543 --> 02:35.876
I need to know.
Does this mean

02:35.911 --> 02:37.678
you're not marrying
your fiancé?

02:37.713 --> 02:38.812
No, it doesn't.

02:38.847 --> 02:39.813
The wedding's next week.

02:39.848 --> 02:43.650
Sheila, listen to me.

02:43.686 --> 02:45.252
That night

02:45.287 --> 02:47.654
was one of the greatest nights
of my entire life,

02:47.690 --> 02:50.424
but the next morning
was one of the worst.

02:50.459 --> 02:52.726
I can't do this.

02:52.761 --> 02:55.028
I just--I can't.

02:55.064 --> 02:57.164
Louis,

02:57.199 --> 03:00.667
I know you better
than you know yourself,

03:00.703 --> 03:02.602
and I know it's only
a matter of time

03:02.638 --> 03:05.072
before you change your mind.

03:05.107 --> 03:08.709
So I'm going to give you
a couple of days,

03:08.744 --> 03:09.854
and then I'm going
to contact you

03:09.878 --> 03:11.845
on this.

03:11.880 --> 03:13.113
It's a burner phone,

03:13.148 --> 03:15.582
and it's <i> completely</i>
untraceable,

03:15.617 --> 03:17.584
so when I call,

03:17.619 --> 03:18.752
you better be ready.
- Yeah?

03:18.787 --> 03:20.854
And when I say "ready,"

03:20.889 --> 03:22.889
what I mean is...

03:22.925 --> 03:26.526
No, no, no, no, no...

03:26.562 --> 03:28.895
Chubby Checker.

03:30.065 --> 03:31.932
Atta boy.

03:38.841 --> 03:40.240
Shit.
That's twice now.

03:46.348 --> 03:49.082
- Jessica.
<i>- Good morning, Harvey.</i>

03:49.118 --> 03:50.717
I take it you saw
the press release.

03:50.753 --> 03:52.753
<i>I did.</i>

03:52.788 --> 03:54.888
I'm sorry that it had to be
that harsh.

03:54.923 --> 03:56.890
<i>It's okay, Harvey.</i>

03:56.925 --> 03:58.069
<i>We both know</i>
<i>it was the only way</i>

03:58.093 --> 03:59.137
<i>I was going to get my money</i>

03:59.161 --> 04:00.727
<i>and let you keep the firm.</i>

04:00.763 --> 04:02.229
<i>But now,</i>
<i>I need something from you.</i>

04:02.264 --> 04:03.797
- Anything.
<i>- I need</i>

04:03.832 --> 04:05.766
$2 million of that money

04:05.801 --> 04:08.969
in an untraceable account.

04:09.004 --> 04:11.304
Jessica, the threshold
for putting money like that

04:11.340 --> 04:13.073
into an account is $10,000.

04:13.108 --> 04:14.574
<i>I'm not keen</i>
<i>on making this happen</i>

04:14.610 --> 04:15.776
<i>without knowing why.</i>

04:15.811 --> 04:17.144
Well, I'm not
telling you why,

04:17.178 --> 04:18.745
but what you're really asking

04:18.781 --> 04:20.346
is am I trying
to break the law?

04:20.382 --> 04:22.883
<i>- Are you?</i>
- No.

04:22.918 --> 04:24.262
I'll declare it
when I'm finished with it.

04:24.286 --> 04:25.819
You have my word on that.

04:25.854 --> 04:27.621
Well, if we get caught
doing this

04:27.656 --> 04:29.589
before you declare it,
it is breaking the law,

04:29.625 --> 04:32.092
so why can't you tell me
what it's for?

04:32.127 --> 04:33.627
<i>Because you don't need</i>
<i>to know,</i>

04:33.662 --> 04:34.594
and I shouldn't have to

04:34.630 --> 04:36.062
tell you what it's for,

04:36.098 --> 04:37.275
because the reason
you're getting me

04:37.299 --> 04:38.598
that money in the first place

04:38.634 --> 04:40.333
is that I saved your ass
not once,

04:40.369 --> 04:41.835
<i>but twice,</i>

04:41.870 --> 04:42.947
<i>so you're either</i>
<i>gonna do this</i>

04:42.971 --> 04:44.271
or you're not.

04:44.306 --> 04:45.939
Which is it?

04:48.710 --> 04:49.879
I'll get it done.

I--I really appreciate you
making the time.

05:34.305 --> 05:35.104
Thanks. Bye.

05:35.267 --> 05:36.659
Louis, I need to talk to you.

05:37.074 --> 05:38.104
What is it, Harvey?

05:38.105 --> 05:39.055
Because I don't have a lot

05:39.056 --> 05:40.503
of excess emotional bandwidth
right now.

05:40.504 --> 05:42.970
I don't give a shit
about your emotional bandwidth, Louis.

05:42.971 --> 05:44.013
This is about Jessica's money.

05:44.037 --> 05:46.138
Then that's easy.
After our letter,

05:46.173 --> 05:47.072
we have the green light
to give her whatever we want.

05:47.107 --> 05:48.006
Got it?
Good.

05:48.041 --> 05:48.782
Now, if you don't mind--
- Louis,

05:48.783 --> 05:50.448
this is not about
how much we're giving her.

05:50.449 --> 05:53.467
It's about how
we're giving it to her.

05:54.019 --> 05:55.618
She wants $2 million
of her payout

05:55.654 --> 05:57.220
in an untraceable account.

05:57.255 --> 05:59.298
Jesus Christ.
And you agreed to that?

05:59.299 --> 06:00.843
Of course I did,
and if she'd asked you,

06:00.867 --> 06:02.092
you'd have done the same thing.

06:02.093 --> 06:03.626
No, I wouldn't have,

06:03.661 --> 06:04.927
because the reason
she'd do that

06:04.962 --> 06:06.128
is to avoid paying taxes,

06:06.163 --> 06:07.574
and I don't want
to be a party to it.

06:07.598 --> 06:08.497
Louis, she gave me her word

06:08.532 --> 06:10.466
she's not doing
anything illegal,

06:10.501 --> 06:11.934
so calm down and just

06:11.969 --> 06:13.736
tell me how we can do this.
- Fine.

06:13.771 --> 06:15.504
The only way to pay her
like that

06:15.539 --> 06:17.573
is by using money that
hasn't hit our accounts yet.

06:17.608 --> 06:19.441
So you're saying
we need to find a client

06:19.477 --> 06:20.954
who owes us
the amount we're paying her?

06:20.978 --> 06:22.578
No, that is not
what I'm saying.

06:22.613 --> 06:24.091
We also need to make sure
that that client

06:24.115 --> 06:25.948
is on board with
redirecting that money

06:25.983 --> 06:27.416
to an untraceable account,

06:27.451 --> 06:28.762
and I don't have any clients
that fit that description,

06:28.786 --> 06:31.453
and neither does anyone else
at this firm.

06:31.489 --> 06:32.599
Louis, we need
to figure something out

06:32.623 --> 06:34.757
Well, I'm sorry, Harvey.
There's no figuring it out

06:34.792 --> 06:36.136
unless you got some magical
client up your sleeve,

06:36.160 --> 06:38.327
so you can tell Jessica,
or I can,

06:38.362 --> 06:39.995
but either way,
we can't do it.

06:40.031 --> 06:41.597
Now if that's all,

06:41.632 --> 06:42.643
I have an appointment
I need to get to.

06:51.976 --> 06:53.275
Hey.

06:53.311 --> 06:55.110
Hey yourself.

06:55.146 --> 06:56.690
You can have a seat,
or did you come all this way

06:56.714 --> 06:58.113
to turn down my offer
of breakfast?

06:58.149 --> 06:59.826
Well, if I'd realized
you were serious about buying,

06:59.850 --> 07:01.183
I wouldn't have had that

07:01.218 --> 07:02.296
giant bowl of Captain Crunch
this morning.

07:02.320 --> 07:03.819
What's going on?
You sounded serious.

07:03.854 --> 07:06.088
I am.

07:09.593 --> 07:11.727
Clinic has a case
against Hudson Mills?

07:11.762 --> 07:13.062
Well, to be more precise,

07:13.097 --> 07:13.862
I have a case

07:13.898 --> 07:15.064
against Hudson Mills.

07:15.099 --> 07:17.132
I represent
Feed the Heart food bank.

07:17.168 --> 07:18.734
I remember them.

07:18.769 --> 07:19.813
Well, do you remember,
for the last five years,

07:19.837 --> 07:21.081
Hudson Mills sold them
a protein pack at cost?

07:21.105 --> 07:23.072
Sure do.
$2 a unit.

07:23.107 --> 07:24.740
Well, last month,
Hudson Mills

07:24.775 --> 07:25.874
jacked their prices,

07:25.910 --> 07:26.809
and the food bank can't afford

07:26.844 --> 07:30.012
more than cost.

07:30.047 --> 07:31.814
Oliver, Hudson Mills
isn't my client.

07:31.849 --> 07:33.315
But it's your firm's client,

07:33.351 --> 07:34.561
and you're a junior partner.
- That doesn't mean that I--

07:34.585 --> 07:36.685
Mike, I'm filing suit
against them,

07:36.721 --> 07:37.486
whether you're on
the other side or not.

07:37.521 --> 07:38.754
I called you because

07:38.789 --> 07:39.621
I don't want to go around

07:39.657 --> 07:41.156
in circles with someone else.

07:41.192 --> 07:42.524
So you want me to elbow
my way in

07:42.560 --> 07:43.859
and rescue the food bank?

07:43.894 --> 07:45.238
That is a direct
conflict of interest.

07:45.262 --> 07:46.895
No, no one needs rescuing.

07:46.931 --> 07:49.198
We just need a fair price.

07:49.233 --> 07:50.933
Please, Mike.
All I'm asking you to do

07:50.968 --> 07:52.501
is go in there,
turn on your charm,

07:52.536 --> 07:53.502
save all of us
a lot of trouble.

07:55.873 --> 07:57.573
All right, I might be able

07:57.608 --> 07:58.685
to convince them to agree
to a lower price,

07:58.709 --> 07:59.641
but I can't promise you they're

07:59.677 --> 08:01.377
gonna go back to
the original one.

08:01.412 --> 08:02.778
Every little bit helps, Mike,

08:02.813 --> 08:04.847
and I appreciate you
helping out a friend.

08:09.253 --> 08:11.687
Louis, you're very quiet.
What's on your mind?

08:11.722 --> 08:12.899
What makes you think
something's on my mind?

08:12.923 --> 08:13.689
Because when you're quiet,

08:13.724 --> 08:15.624
it usually indicates

08:15.659 --> 08:17.092
you're scared
to confront an issue,

08:17.128 --> 08:20.162
but this is why we are here.
So talk to me.

08:20.197 --> 08:21.908
Well, it's hard to talk
when it's so hot in here.

08:21.932 --> 08:23.766
I mean, Jesus,
it's like a goddamn oven.

08:23.801 --> 08:26.235
Louis, it's 63 degrees.

08:26.270 --> 08:28.537
Stop hiding
and just tell me.

08:28.572 --> 08:29.905
Sheila dipped her hands
in my mud.

08:33.844 --> 08:36.111
I see.

08:36.147 --> 08:39.148
And... what did you say

08:39.183 --> 08:41.116
when she attempted
to seduce you again?

08:41.152 --> 08:42.629
I told her how the last time
made me feel,

08:42.653 --> 08:43.897
and I wouldn't do that
to myself again.

08:43.921 --> 08:44.787
Because you understood

08:44.822 --> 08:46.288
there's no future
with this woman.

08:46.323 --> 08:47.823
I did, but what if I said

08:47.858 --> 08:49.992
that I don't give a shit
about the future?

08:50.027 --> 08:51.260
I care about right now.

08:51.295 --> 08:52.261
I'd say that

08:52.296 --> 08:53.306
you're once again becoming

08:53.330 --> 08:54.663
drawn to a woman

08:54.698 --> 08:55.531
who cannot properly
love you back.

08:55.566 --> 08:56.799
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

08:56.834 --> 08:57.844
Back up the truck, Sigmund.

08:57.868 --> 09:00.169
Where's that coming from?

09:00.204 --> 09:01.937
Louis,

09:01.972 --> 09:04.006
something happened to you

09:04.041 --> 09:05.974
that makes you feel
you don't deserve a woman

09:06.010 --> 09:08.677
who is 100% available,

09:08.712 --> 09:10.746
and I would like to figure out
what it was.

09:10.781 --> 09:12.114
It doesn't matter
what it was,

09:12.149 --> 09:13.682
because true love
is for fairy tales,

09:13.717 --> 09:14.961
and it sure as shit
isn't for me.

09:14.985 --> 09:16.685
Then I am afraid
you are doomed

09:16.720 --> 09:18.687
to keep repeating your pattern

09:18.722 --> 09:19.722
of becoming involved

09:19.757 --> 09:21.790
with unavailable women.

09:24.195 --> 09:26.261
Well, you know what, Stan?

09:26.297 --> 09:27.596
Instead of wasting my time

09:27.631 --> 09:29.531
dwelling on why I go after
unavailable women,

09:29.567 --> 09:30.833
I'm gonna use my time

09:30.868 --> 09:32.701
making sure that
Sheila Amanda Sazs

09:32.736 --> 09:35.671
is available to me, 100%.

09:39.877 --> 09:41.188
Harvey, can I talk to you
about something?

09:41.212 --> 09:42.277
What do you need, Donna?

09:42.313 --> 09:43.278
I overheard you and Louis

09:43.314 --> 09:45.180
arguing about Jessica's money.

09:45.216 --> 09:45.981
Well, if you're here
to tell me

09:46.016 --> 09:47.883
that you agree with him--

09:47.918 --> 09:49.558
I'm here to tell you
it's time to see Vic.

09:50.588 --> 09:51.787
- No.
- Harvey,

09:51.822 --> 09:53.188
I know you feel like
you owe him

09:53.224 --> 09:54.890
because of your father.
- I do owe him.

09:54.925 --> 09:56.158
And you've paid him back

09:56.193 --> 09:57.793
by doing millions in work
off the books.

09:57.828 --> 09:59.061
Even if I went to him,

09:59.096 --> 10:00.373
he doesn't have the money,
Donna.

10:00.397 --> 10:02.097
Driscoll Records does,
and you know it.

10:02.132 --> 10:05.601
You always said Driscoll was
dying to buy out his catalog.

10:05.636 --> 10:06.902
This way,
Jessica gets her money

10:06.937 --> 10:07.769
and he can retire
without ever having

10:07.805 --> 10:09.671
to worry about money again.

10:09.707 --> 10:10.572
And what do you think happens

10:10.608 --> 10:11.406
to my dad's music once he does?

10:11.442 --> 10:13.208
I'll tell you what happens.

10:13.244 --> 10:14.877
It sits in a vault
and it collects dust

10:14.912 --> 10:17.246
and no one ever hears it again.

10:17.281 --> 10:18.725
Harvey, I know you're
trying to protect

10:18.749 --> 10:21.683
your father's legacy,

10:21.719 --> 10:24.152
but you promised Jessica
you'd look after hers, too.

10:24.188 --> 10:25.754
Yeah, well,

10:25.789 --> 10:27.923
I didn't think I'd be choosing
between the two.

10:29.126 --> 10:31.260
You're not.

10:31.295 --> 10:33.095
You're just doing what's right.

10:34.431 --> 10:35.631
Okay, Donna,
I'll go see him

10:37.401 --> 10:38.700
And before you do,

10:38.736 --> 10:39.913
remember that conversation
we had

10:39.937 --> 10:40.736
about Mike not being ready?

10:42.406 --> 10:44.006
I just found out
about something he did,

10:44.041 --> 10:44.873
and I think you should know.

10:49.046 --> 10:49.978
Harvey, hey,
what's going on?

10:50.014 --> 10:51.380
Don't give me that.

10:51.415 --> 10:52.781
Did you go to Tom Perkins

10:52.816 --> 10:53.582
and convince him

10:53.617 --> 10:54.550
to take a haircut on his deal?

10:54.585 --> 10:56.919
Yes, I did.
Why, is that a problem?

10:56.954 --> 10:58.031
I don't have a problem
with you doing it.

10:58.055 --> 10:59.955
I have a problem with you
not disclosing

10:59.990 --> 11:02.057
that the opposing counsel
is Oliver Grady.

11:02.092 --> 11:02.925
- Harvey...
- And, for that matter,

11:02.960 --> 11:04.226
not clearing it with me

11:04.261 --> 11:06.228
before you took a client
from another associate.

11:06.263 --> 11:08.163
It's not another associate,
Harvey.

11:08.198 --> 11:09.765
I'm a junior partner,

11:09.800 --> 11:11.767
and as far as I'm concerned,
I did us all a favor.

11:11.802 --> 11:12.534
You want to walk me
through that?

11:12.570 --> 11:13.869
I'd be happy to.

11:13.904 --> 11:14.870
If Oliver sues us,

11:14.905 --> 11:16.204
it's not good for the clinic,

11:16.240 --> 11:17.384
it's not good for our client,

11:17.408 --> 11:18.974
and it's sure as hell
not good for us.

11:19.009 --> 11:20.642
This way,

11:20.678 --> 11:21.788
we land where we would have
landed,

11:21.812 --> 11:22.945
without all the trouble.

11:22.980 --> 11:24.246
And what, exactly,
is your plan

11:24.281 --> 11:26.148
if it doesn't work out
how you say?

11:26.183 --> 11:28.884
If Tom Perkins finds out
that you didn't tell him

11:28.919 --> 11:30.152
that Oliver's your best friend

11:30.187 --> 11:31.920
and he comes after us
for malpractice?

11:31.956 --> 11:32.999
- It's not gonna happen.
- How do you know?

11:33.023 --> 11:35.157
Because I trust Oliver,
and he trusts me.

11:35.192 --> 11:36.403
And I used to believe in
the Tooth Fairy,

11:36.427 --> 11:37.392
and then I grew up.

11:37.428 --> 11:39.161
This isn't the Tooth Fairy,
Harvey.

11:39.196 --> 11:41.129
It's a human being
who I trust.

11:41.165 --> 11:42.731
If you can't see
the difference,

11:42.766 --> 11:43.843
I don't know what I can do
for you.

11:43.867 --> 11:44.566
Well, you better be right,

11:44.602 --> 11:45.834
because the last time

11:45.869 --> 11:46.835
you involved that kid,

11:46.870 --> 11:48.136
he almost tore us apart.

11:56.354 --> 11:58.455
What is it, Gretchen?

11:58.490 --> 11:59.962
If you wanted to do
some digging, Louis,

11:59.963 --> 12:01.563
I could've brought you
a shovel.

12:01.598 --> 12:03.265
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

12:03.300 --> 12:05.167
Why the hell did you
set up meetings

12:05.202 --> 12:07.235
with Jerry the Gambler,
Holly Cromwell,

12:07.271 --> 12:10.305
and... a private detective
named Vanessa?

12:10.340 --> 12:12.018
They're doing some work
for me, and you don't

12:12.042 --> 12:13.008
need to know about it.
- When that work involves

12:13.043 --> 12:15.343
blackmailing
that Sazs woman's fiancé,

12:15.379 --> 12:17.279
I make it my business
to know about it.

12:17.314 --> 12:18.358
Nobody's blackmailing
anyone.

12:18.382 --> 12:20.415
Cut the bullshit, Louis.

12:20.450 --> 12:22.450
You're hiring these people
to get dirt on that man

12:22.486 --> 12:23.663
so you can sabotage
his marriage.

12:23.687 --> 12:24.419
So what if I am?

12:24.454 --> 12:26.021
If you wanted to destroy

12:26.056 --> 12:26.922
that woman's marriage,

12:26.957 --> 12:28.490
you could just tell that fool

12:28.525 --> 12:29.958
you've been planting
in his garden.

12:29.993 --> 12:30.859
What?

12:30.894 --> 12:32.127
How'd you know that?

12:32.162 --> 12:34.129
I got a $1,100
minibar bill

12:34.164 --> 12:35.597
from the Carlyle Hotel,

12:35.632 --> 12:37.465
and two plus two equals...

12:37.501 --> 12:38.711
something
I'd rather not picture.

12:38.735 --> 12:40.213
Well, you know what?
It doesn't matter,

12:40.237 --> 12:41.314
because I'm never gonna
tell him about it.

12:41.338 --> 12:43.305
- Why not?
- Because.

12:43.340 --> 12:46.141
It's one thing for me to
make him look bad in her eyes,

12:46.176 --> 12:47.353
but I could never
make her look bad in his.

12:47.377 --> 12:49.177
Louis, if you feel
that way about her,

12:49.213 --> 12:51.012
why don't you just tell her?

12:54.051 --> 12:55.717
What if she says no?

12:55.752 --> 12:57.219
Then you got your answer.

12:58.355 --> 13:00.689
In the meantime,
I'm canceling these meetings.

13:23.247 --> 13:24.379
Louis!

13:24.414 --> 13:25.547
What a pleasure to see you.

13:25.582 --> 13:27.182
Thank you, Mr. Goldfarb.

13:27.217 --> 13:29.017
It's a pleasure to see
both of you.

13:29.052 --> 13:31.653
These are for you.

13:31.688 --> 13:33.555
Sorry, I didn't bring
anything for you, Mr. G.

13:33.590 --> 13:35.190
Well, if you need
any ideas,

13:35.225 --> 13:36.191
those new Trans Ams
are pretty spiffy.

13:36.226 --> 13:38.526
Ha! That's hilarious.

13:38.562 --> 13:40.695
Everyone knows only jerks
drive fast cars.

13:40.731 --> 13:42.364
So what are
the big plans tonight?

13:42.399 --> 13:43.431
Wait for it:

13:43.467 --> 13:45.033
The Scarsdale
Repertory Company's

13:45.068 --> 13:45.901
performing "Uncle Vanya."

13:45.936 --> 13:48.670
Wow, that sounds thrilling.

13:48.705 --> 13:50.205
Don't tell Mitzy.

13:50.240 --> 13:51.384
I want to--
- Don't tell me what?

13:56.880 --> 14:01.049
<i>♪ Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha ♪</i>

14:01.084 --> 14:06.588
<i>♪ I know this much is true ♪</i>

14:06.623 --> 14:10.592
<i>♪ Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha ♪</i>

14:10.627 --> 14:12.093
<i>♪ I know this... ♪</i>

14:12.129 --> 14:14.829
Oh, my God...

14:14.865 --> 14:16.531
<i>♪ True ♪</i>

14:16.566 --> 14:19.067
<i>♪ Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha... ♪</i>

14:19.102 --> 14:20.802
How do I look?

14:20.837 --> 14:22.404
You're the most
beautiful girl

14:22.439 --> 14:23.738
in the world.

14:23.774 --> 14:26.441
And you're the best boyfriend
in the world.

14:26.476 --> 14:28.410
Have her home by 11:00,
tiger.

14:28.445 --> 14:29.711
I'll do you one better,
Mr. G.

14:29.746 --> 14:31.279
I'll have her home by 10:30.

14:36.620 --> 14:38.119
Excuse me.
I'm looking for

14:38.155 --> 14:39.888
the best jazz producer
in New York City.

14:39.923 --> 14:42.257
Do you have any idea
where I might find him?

14:42.292 --> 14:43.625
Not a clue, kid,

14:43.660 --> 14:45.160
but I can pretend to be him

14:45.195 --> 14:47.595
until you track
that asshole down.

14:49.599 --> 14:50.832
Hey.

14:50.867 --> 14:52.434
You got my note, huh?

14:52.469 --> 14:54.269
That I sent you last month?

14:54.304 --> 14:57.072
The one about the two
stations on the West Coast

14:57.107 --> 14:58.239
playing my dad's music?

14:58.275 --> 14:59.507
And Chicago.

14:59.543 --> 15:01.609
I'll never stop fighting
for him, Harvey,

15:01.645 --> 15:04.346
even though he's gone.

15:04.381 --> 15:06.581
Thanks, Vic.

15:06.616 --> 15:09.317
I asked you to come here

15:09.353 --> 15:11.119
because I wanted to thank you

15:11.154 --> 15:13.288
for helping out,
getting me that loan,

15:13.323 --> 15:14.756
but then I got your bill.

15:14.791 --> 15:15.957
Harvey,

15:15.993 --> 15:17.425
it is hard for me to say, man,

15:17.461 --> 15:18.259
but I don't have the money

15:18.295 --> 15:19.627
to pay you for your work.

15:19.663 --> 15:21.162
What are you talking about?

15:21.198 --> 15:22.542
You just got a loan
for $2 million.

15:22.566 --> 15:24.599
Yeah, well, that was
for working capital.

15:24.634 --> 15:26.301
Then you should have put
a line item

15:26.336 --> 15:27.469
in for your legal bills.

15:27.504 --> 15:30.305
Once I put those hours down,
it's out of my hands.

15:30.340 --> 15:31.506
Don't put them down.

15:31.541 --> 15:34.309
You want me to commit fraud?

15:34.344 --> 15:35.243
No.

15:35.278 --> 15:36.511
No, I--

15:36.546 --> 15:38.279
I want you to make a side tab

15:38.315 --> 15:39.280
for any work you do for me.

15:39.316 --> 15:40.348
You know I'm good for it.

15:40.384 --> 15:41.850
How exactly do I know that?

15:41.885 --> 15:43.551
Call Ricky Thompsen
at Driscoll.

15:43.587 --> 15:45.286
He offers me $20 million
every year

15:45.322 --> 15:46.354
for my library alone.

15:46.390 --> 15:47.956
Then I'd say

15:47.991 --> 15:49.235
it's time to take him up
on his offer.

15:49.259 --> 15:51.292
If I sell, nobody

15:51.328 --> 15:54.229
gets to hear your father's
records ever again.

15:56.433 --> 15:58.333
Vic, if you're playing me...

15:58.368 --> 15:59.846
If you think I'd use
my history with your father

15:59.870 --> 16:01.636
to manipulate you,

16:01.671 --> 16:03.571
then I might as well
call Thompsen right now,

16:03.607 --> 16:06.307
because if you can't appreciate

16:06.343 --> 16:07.653
what I'm fighting
to preserve here,

16:07.677 --> 16:08.843
then nobody can.

16:11.214 --> 16:13.415
Okay, Vic,
I'll put you on a side tab.

16:20.457 --> 16:22.557
Still working
around the clock, I see.

16:22.592 --> 16:25.193
Well,

16:25.228 --> 16:27.462
if it isn't the man
in the million-dollar suit.

16:27.497 --> 16:28.430
I know why you're here,

16:28.465 --> 16:29.998
and I don't have your money,
Harvey.

16:30.033 --> 16:31.733
You have it
and you know it.

16:31.768 --> 16:33.201
Don't you have enough?

16:33.236 --> 16:34.781
You got to come here,
squeeze an old man?

16:34.805 --> 16:36.337
Oh, don't give me that shit.

16:36.373 --> 16:37.450
I've been carrying you
for ten years,

16:37.474 --> 16:38.673
and I can't do it anymore.

16:38.708 --> 16:40.608
Harvey, what in the hell
is going on here?

16:40.644 --> 16:42.844
What's going on is
you once came to me

16:42.879 --> 16:44.512
for a favor,
and I let it slide,

16:44.548 --> 16:46.381
and now I'm coming to you
for a favor.

16:46.416 --> 16:47.527
What do you mean, "a favor"?

16:47.551 --> 16:49.551
I mean, you're not just
gonna sell your company.

16:49.586 --> 16:50.963
You're gonna pay me
the money that you owe me,

16:50.987 --> 16:52.565
you're gonna send it
to a numbered account,

16:52.589 --> 16:53.900
and you're never gonna
tell anyone.

16:53.924 --> 16:55.557
Let me get this straight.

16:55.592 --> 16:57.559
You're not just asking me
to sell my company,

16:57.594 --> 16:59.027
but you're asking me to cross

16:59.062 --> 17:00.795
some kind of line
while I do it?

17:00.831 --> 17:02.697
Just like you made me cross
the line

17:02.732 --> 17:04.598
when you needed me
to keep your bills

17:04.634 --> 17:06.401
off the books for ten years.

17:06.435 --> 17:09.404
But I did it so that I could
keep fighting the good fight.

17:09.439 --> 17:10.550
Is that what this is about,
Harvey?

17:10.574 --> 17:11.673
If you need to ask me that

17:11.708 --> 17:13.907
after all these years,

17:13.944 --> 17:15.810
keep your money
and keep your company.

17:15.846 --> 17:17.945
Uh, hey, hey, Harvey.

17:17.981 --> 17:19.347
Come on, son.

17:23.420 --> 17:24.685
I'll sell.

17:26.656 --> 17:28.021
I'll sell.

17:35.532 --> 17:37.398
Hey.

17:37.434 --> 17:38.900
I never heard back from you.

17:38.935 --> 17:40.401
Did you get the number I sent?

17:40.437 --> 17:41.936
Yeah, I did,
and I'm sorry, Mike,

17:41.972 --> 17:43.282
but it's not good enough.
- Not good enough?

17:43.306 --> 17:44.239
Oliver, you asked me
to go to bat for you,

17:44.274 --> 17:45.573
and I did.
What's the problem?

17:45.609 --> 17:47.742
The problem is I wanted
the original price,

17:47.777 --> 17:48.743
and you didn't come through.

17:48.778 --> 17:50.011
Are you kidding me?

17:50.046 --> 17:52.013
This is 70% of the way there,
and when I told you

17:52.048 --> 17:53.448
we might not get
all the way there,

17:53.483 --> 17:54.749
you said every little bit
helps.

17:54.784 --> 17:55.750
Well, a guy I know
once told me

17:55.785 --> 17:57.619
when an offer comes in this
easy,

17:57.654 --> 17:59.287
there's more than
meets the eye.

17:59.322 --> 18:00.333
I don't believe this.
You're the one that came to me

18:00.357 --> 18:01.456
asking for a favor.

18:01.491 --> 18:03.958
Like you came to me
on the prison case?

18:03.994 --> 18:05.627
And when I got a deal,

18:05.662 --> 18:07.328
you convinced my client
to reject it?

18:07.364 --> 18:08.930
So that's what this is about.

18:08.965 --> 18:10.810
This has nothing to do with
Hudson Mills or the food bank.

18:10.834 --> 18:12.634
You know how many clients
at the clinic

18:12.669 --> 18:13.946
have asked Nathan to remove me
from their cases, Mike?

18:13.970 --> 18:15.181
- No, I had no idea.
- Oh, you didn't,

18:15.205 --> 18:16.349
because you never cared to ask,

18:16.373 --> 18:18.640
and I need this win
to get things back on track.

18:18.675 --> 18:20.820
Oliver, I understand why
you think this is a good idea,

18:20.844 --> 18:21.776
but it's not,

18:21.811 --> 18:23.611
so if you know
what's good for you,

18:23.647 --> 18:25.491
you will accept this number
and be done with it.

18:25.515 --> 18:27.426
Sorry, Mike, but I'm not
taking your advice on this one.

18:31.855 --> 18:33.488
You're deposing my client?

18:33.523 --> 18:35.390
I sure as hell am.

18:37.060 --> 18:38.804
You knew it was gonna
go this way, didn't you?

18:38.828 --> 18:40.562
I knew if you didn't
come back,

18:40.597 --> 18:41.796
giving me what I asked for,

18:41.831 --> 18:43.398
this was how it was gonna go,

18:43.433 --> 18:44.465
so if you'll excuse me,

18:44.501 --> 18:46.134
I have a deposition
to prepare for,

18:46.169 --> 18:47.569
and so do you.

18:59.965 --> 19:02.999
You want a pad Thai
or green curry?

19:03.034 --> 19:04.267
Oh, that depends.

19:04.302 --> 19:06.080
You ordering from
the place that delivers here,

19:06.104 --> 19:07.837
or the one near our place?

19:07.872 --> 19:09.639
And if you're asking me
that question,

19:09.674 --> 19:12.275
it means you're working late.

19:12.310 --> 19:14.544
What's going on?

19:14.579 --> 19:15.845
Working on this case

19:15.880 --> 19:17.747
with Hudson Mills
against the clinic.

19:17.782 --> 19:20.049
Going against the clinic?
Why didn't you tell me that?

19:20.085 --> 19:22.719
Well, because I didn't think
there was anything to tell.

19:24.289 --> 19:25.855
Oliver's on the other side,

19:25.890 --> 19:27.301
and he asked me
to help broker a deal.

19:27.325 --> 19:28.791
And let me guess:

19:28.827 --> 19:29.827
things aren't going

19:29.861 --> 19:31.861
quite as smoothly
as you thought they would.

19:31.896 --> 19:34.030
Ah, no, they blew up
in my face,

19:34.065 --> 19:35.265
and if I don't smack him down,

19:35.300 --> 19:36.933
Harvey is gonna
rip me a new one,

19:36.968 --> 19:37.968
because he warned me that

19:38.003 --> 19:38.835
Oliver was gonna try

19:38.870 --> 19:41.771
and pull some shit like this.

19:41.806 --> 19:45.541
You say that like you're
a little bit proud of Oliver.

19:45.577 --> 19:46.577
Of course I am.

19:46.611 --> 19:48.177
He came to me
with an arrangement,

19:48.213 --> 19:51.247
and then he completely
changed the deal.

19:51.282 --> 19:52.982
He pulled a me.

19:53.018 --> 19:54.228
And now you have
to pull a Harvey

19:54.252 --> 19:55.852
and not let him
get away with it.

19:55.887 --> 19:56.919
- Exactly.
- Okay.

19:56.955 --> 19:58.655
So what I meant was

19:58.690 --> 20:00.067
we're gonna order from
the place that delivers here,

20:00.091 --> 20:00.990
because I am gonna help you

20:01.026 --> 20:02.592
kick that
Mike Ross wannabe's ass

20:02.627 --> 20:03.627
six ways to Sunday.

20:03.662 --> 20:05.728
Wow, I love it
when you talk like that.

20:05.764 --> 20:06.496
I know you do.

20:06.531 --> 20:07.531
Now hand me the file

20:07.565 --> 20:09.065
and order me
a Kick Wannabe's Ass,

20:09.100 --> 20:10.767
number seven.

20:12.303 --> 20:13.903
Good, you're here.

20:13.938 --> 20:15.249
I need you to coordinate
with Louis

20:15.273 --> 20:16.806
and set up a numbered account.

20:16.841 --> 20:18.074
Vic agreed to everything.

20:18.109 --> 20:19.842
- I know.
- How do you know?

20:19.878 --> 20:21.911
Because Driscoll
sent over the contract.

20:21.946 --> 20:23.946
- What is it?
- Harvey, before you see it--

20:23.982 --> 20:25.615
Just give it to me, Donna.

20:29.954 --> 20:31.054
What are you gonna do?

20:31.089 --> 20:32.099
What do you think
I'm gonna do?

20:32.123 --> 20:33.589
I gave my word.

20:33.625 --> 20:35.925
I'm gonna get him
his fucking money.

20:40.398 --> 20:42.598
Sheila,
I need to talk to you.

20:42.634 --> 20:44.133
Louis, you're here.

20:44.169 --> 20:47.136
I haven't even
called the burn phone yet.

20:47.172 --> 20:49.038
I've got 15 minutes.

20:49.074 --> 20:51.107
There's a supply closet
on the third floor.

20:51.142 --> 20:53.276
The closet can wait.

20:53.311 --> 20:54.977
Sheila, I want you
to leave your fiancé.

20:55.013 --> 20:57.113
- Louis--
- Hear me out.

20:57.148 --> 20:58.981
You obviously still
feel something for me.

20:59.017 --> 21:00.650
You haven't walked down
the aisle yet.

21:00.685 --> 21:02.385
There's still time
to call this off

21:02.420 --> 21:03.720
so we can be together.

21:03.755 --> 21:04.620
I know you believe

21:04.656 --> 21:05.988
what you're saying,

21:06.024 --> 21:08.357
but we want different things.

21:08.393 --> 21:09.992
You want a family.

21:10.028 --> 21:11.305
But Sheila, I can change
what I want

21:11.329 --> 21:12.829
if it means being with you.

21:12.864 --> 21:15.131
No, you can't, Louis.

21:15.166 --> 21:18.801
You broke my heart
once before.

21:18.837 --> 21:21.237
I will not give it to you
to shatter again.

21:21.272 --> 21:22.705
Well, what about your fiancé?

21:22.741 --> 21:23.884
What about what that
would do to him?

21:23.908 --> 21:24.919
He doesn't ever
have to find out.

21:26.678 --> 21:29.378
I'm sorry, Sheila.

21:29.414 --> 21:31.347
I can't be a bad boy.

21:31.382 --> 21:35.151
It's not in my nature.

21:35.186 --> 21:36.330
Well, if you
change your mind,

21:36.354 --> 21:37.587
you know how to find me.

21:37.622 --> 21:39.822
I'm not gonna change my mind.

21:39.858 --> 21:41.290
In fact...

21:43.361 --> 21:45.161
I think it's best
if you don't call me again.

22:02.413 --> 22:05.748
Dr. Lipschitz, it's me.

22:05.784 --> 22:07.750
I need your help.

22:07.786 --> 22:10.052
I'm ready to talk about
what happened.

22:16.995 --> 22:18.861
Hey, Louis.
Do you have a second?

22:18.897 --> 22:19.929
No, Esther.

22:19.964 --> 22:20.930
And if you're here to apologize

22:20.965 --> 22:22.231
for you and Tricia Vandermeer

22:22.267 --> 22:23.232
saying I was losing my hair,

22:23.268 --> 22:24.367
I'm not interested.

22:24.402 --> 22:26.202
It's not about that, Louis.

22:26.237 --> 22:29.438
I wanted to ask how things are
going with Mitzy Goldfarb.

22:29.474 --> 22:31.440
Things are amazing.
Why do you ask?

22:31.476 --> 22:33.142
I wouldn't be
a very good sister

22:33.178 --> 22:34.722
if I didn't tell you about
a rumor that I heard.

22:34.746 --> 22:36.112
What rumor?

22:36.147 --> 22:37.113
That Mitzy's been seeing
Drake Johnson

22:37.148 --> 22:38.214
behind your back.

22:38.249 --> 22:38.981
Are you kidding me?

22:39.017 --> 22:40.817
Drake the Snake?

22:40.852 --> 22:42.129
I don't even know
why they call him that.

22:42.153 --> 22:43.164
He doesn't look anything
like a snake.

22:43.188 --> 22:45.321
What on Earth
would Mitzy want with him?

22:45.356 --> 22:47.390
I don't know, Louis.
I just know what I heard.

22:47.425 --> 22:48.736
Well, did you hear from
either of them?

22:48.760 --> 22:49.492
- No.
- Then it's hearsay

22:49.527 --> 22:50.493
and inadmissible,

22:50.528 --> 22:52.261
and I move to strike it
from the record

22:52.297 --> 22:53.496
Louis, what is wrong
with you?

22:53.531 --> 22:54.997
Okay?
This isn't some meeting

22:55.033 --> 22:56.477
of your Future Lawyers
of America club.

22:56.501 --> 22:58.367
I'm your sister.
I'm looking out for you.

22:58.403 --> 22:59.735
Bullshit you are!

22:59.771 --> 23:01.804
You can't stand
to see me happy.

23:01.840 --> 23:03.918
And for your information, it's
Future Lawyers of the World.

23:03.942 --> 23:04.907
Okay, Mr. Future Lawyer,

23:04.943 --> 23:05.908
if you really don't
believe me,

23:05.944 --> 23:06.742
you can come see it
for yourself.

23:06.778 --> 23:08.778
What's that supposed to mean?

23:08.813 --> 23:09.645
It means Bobby Sabatini's

23:09.681 --> 23:11.013
having a party tomorrow night,

23:11.049 --> 23:11.747
and I bet you a million dollars

23:11.783 --> 23:13.916
Mitzy's going with Drake.

23:13.952 --> 23:15.284
That's ridiculous.

23:15.320 --> 23:16.931
Mitzy and her girlfriends
are washing their hair

23:16.955 --> 23:19.155
with a new shampoo
they got from Europe.

23:19.190 --> 23:21.090
Okay, Louis,

23:21.125 --> 23:23.025
you tell yourself
whatever you want,

23:23.061 --> 23:25.361
but if I were you,
I'd want to know the truth.

23:30.902 --> 23:32.401
- Can I help you?
- That depends

23:32.437 --> 23:34.103
are you the guy
that sent back my offer

23:34.138 --> 23:35.438
at half the price
we set in stone

23:35.473 --> 23:36.305
a decade ago?

23:36.341 --> 23:38.174
You must be
Harvey Specter.

23:38.209 --> 23:40.176
Yeah, I am, and I don't know
who you are,

23:40.211 --> 23:41.944
but...

23:41.980 --> 23:44.213
My client has had
a handshake deal from Driscoll

23:44.249 --> 23:45.426
since you were
in middle school.

23:45.450 --> 23:46.415
You gonna make jokes
that I have pimples, too?

23:46.451 --> 23:47.850
This isn't a joke,

23:47.886 --> 23:49.418
and you're lucky
I'm coming to you,

23:49.454 --> 23:52.955
because I tell Ricky Thompsen
that you're pulling this shit--

23:52.991 --> 23:54.957
Ricky Thompsen
doesn't work here anymore.

23:54.993 --> 23:56.192
He got fired because

23:56.227 --> 23:57.504
he spent too much
on nostalgic bullshit.

23:57.528 --> 23:59.195
Listen to me.
Ricky may be gone,

23:59.230 --> 24:00.029
but you still have
other bosses,

24:00.064 --> 24:01.497
and they want this music,

24:01.532 --> 24:03.299
or you wouldn't have made
an offer.

24:03.334 --> 24:04.478
- I'm done with this.
- Well, I don't need Ricky

24:04.502 --> 24:06.402
to march into
your CEO's office

24:06.437 --> 24:08.471
and tell him I'm gonna gift
this collection

24:08.506 --> 24:10.473
to Sony for $15 million,

24:10.508 --> 24:13.843
and you're the guy who lost it
after everyone knows he had it.

24:15.113 --> 24:17.013
I'll match the $15 million,

24:17.048 --> 24:19.148
but that's the best
I can do.

24:19.183 --> 24:21.550
I'm telling you, this music
isn't worth what it used to be,

24:21.586 --> 24:23.386
and you go into
my CEO's office,

24:23.421 --> 24:25.321
he'll tell you the same thing.

24:27.592 --> 24:28.858
<i>Okay, let's get down to it.</i>

24:28.893 --> 24:30.826
My client's a busy man.

24:30.862 --> 24:32.406
And I offered your food bank
a fair deal,

24:32.430 --> 24:33.941
so I really don't see
what there is to discuss.

24:33.965 --> 24:35.097
This won't take long.

24:35.133 --> 24:36.443
I just want to clarify
your company's contract

24:36.467 --> 24:37.811
with Feed the Heart--
- There is no contract.

24:37.835 --> 24:40.236
Those protein packs
fall under the definition

24:40.271 --> 24:41.871
of a charitable contribution.

24:41.906 --> 24:42.972
Call it whatever you want.

24:43.007 --> 24:44.874
They supplied those packs
for five years,

24:44.909 --> 24:45.775
and that makes it
a contract.

24:45.810 --> 24:47.109
I beg to differ.

24:47.145 --> 24:48.978
A contract
requires consideration,

24:49.013 --> 24:50.513
and our client got nothing.

24:50.548 --> 24:52.092
And if it's all the same
to you, I'd like to hear

24:52.116 --> 24:53.783
your client say that.
- Then I will.

24:53.818 --> 24:56.352
I got a box of T-shirts
and some rubber bracelets.

24:56.387 --> 24:58.020
I didn't ask for them,
I never used them,

24:58.056 --> 24:59.889
and I'd be happy
to send them back.

24:59.924 --> 25:02.091
And I'm not building my case
on T-shirts and bracelets.

25:02.126 --> 25:03.904
Then what in God's name
are you building it on?

25:03.928 --> 25:06.128
I'm building it on
a commercial your client made

25:06.164 --> 25:08.531
advertising their relationship
with my client.

25:08.566 --> 25:11.233
Our client never produced
any commercial like that.

25:11.269 --> 25:12.101
How about the one
that played in Des Moines

25:12.136 --> 25:14.136
in July of last year?

25:14.172 --> 25:15.172
Ring a bell, Mr. Perkins?

25:15.206 --> 25:16.517
That was a trade show,
with an audience of only--

25:16.541 --> 25:17.974
2,000 people?
Doesn't matter,

25:18.009 --> 25:21.277
because when it was over,
you negotiated a five-year deal

25:21.312 --> 25:23.157
based on the work
you were doing with my client.

25:23.181 --> 25:24.258
I need to talk to my client.

25:24.282 --> 25:25.626
Why, to tell him to lie?
Because I have

25:25.650 --> 25:26.860
a copy with me.
- We're calling a break.

25:26.884 --> 25:29.385
Would you like to see it,
Mr. Perkins?

25:29.420 --> 25:30.631
No, I goddamn wouldn't.
I know what the hell it is,

25:30.655 --> 25:32.154
and this is
a bucket of bullshit.

25:32.190 --> 25:33.122
But it's true?

25:33.157 --> 25:36.392
That commercial exists?

25:36.427 --> 25:37.660
Yes, it does.

25:37.695 --> 25:39.962
I appreciate your honesty,
Mr. Perkins,

25:39.998 --> 25:41.008
and Mike, I expect to hear
from you soon

25:41.032 --> 25:41.864
that your client
will be honoring

25:41.899 --> 25:43.466
their original contract,

25:43.501 --> 25:45.067
or the next time I see you

25:45.103 --> 25:46.602
will be in court.

25:52.649 --> 25:53.683
Oliver, wait.

25:54.118 --> 25:56.118
What is it, Mike?
I need to tell my client

25:56.153 --> 25:57.431
I just nailed Hudson Mills
to the wall.

25:57.455 --> 25:59.166
Well, while you're at it,
why don't you tell them

25:59.190 --> 26:00.155
that the new offer
is $2.20 a unit?

26:00.191 --> 26:02.124
Why don't I wait until
your lying client

26:02.159 --> 26:03.726
honors his original price?

26:03.761 --> 26:05.261
'Cause that's
not gonna happen.

26:05.296 --> 26:07.162
Then I guess, uh,
we're going to court,

26:07.198 --> 26:08.475
and you wasted your time
running after me.

26:08.499 --> 26:10.199
Oliver, please, just stop!

26:12.503 --> 26:14.537
Look, you killed it
in there, okay?

26:14.572 --> 26:16.750
You wiped the floor with us.
Is that what you want to hear?

26:16.774 --> 26:18.307
- It's a start.
- Good.

26:18.342 --> 26:20.042
But this was just
a deposition. All right?

26:20.077 --> 26:21.221
You trust me, I'm gonna
have him prepared for court,

26:21.245 --> 26:22.011
and if we go to trial
and I win,

26:22.046 --> 26:23.779
you're gonna get nothing.

26:23.814 --> 26:25.581
- You're not gonna win.
- Oliver,

26:25.616 --> 26:27.394
I'm telling you, you're not
gonna do better than this.

26:27.418 --> 26:28.462
And that's what you said
the last time we negotiated,

26:28.486 --> 26:29.418
when we were 70% there.

26:29.453 --> 26:31.287
And now we're 90% there.

26:31.322 --> 26:33.088
Then call me when you get
to 100.

26:33.124 --> 26:34.089
Goddamn it, Oliver,
this is about our clients.

26:34.125 --> 26:35.202
You're making it about
me and you.

26:35.226 --> 26:36.959
You're right, Mike,
it is about you and me,

26:36.994 --> 26:38.027
but not like you think,

26:38.062 --> 26:40.329
'cause your client
is a for-profit entity

26:40.364 --> 26:42.064
that sold us those packs
at cost.

26:42.099 --> 26:43.232
At cost.

26:43.267 --> 26:45.701
That's their definition
of a charitable donation,

26:45.736 --> 26:47.180
and now they're
jacking their price up

26:47.204 --> 26:48.604
because of their
stock price sagging

26:48.639 --> 26:50.183
or whatever other
bullshit reason they have.

26:50.207 --> 26:51.585
What does that have to do
with me and you?

26:51.609 --> 26:53.108
Because from the day we met,
you said

26:53.144 --> 26:53.909
you were about
the little guy,

26:53.945 --> 26:54.777
but you're not.

26:54.812 --> 26:56.645
You're 70% there,

26:56.681 --> 26:57.681
or 90% there.

26:57.715 --> 26:59.615
Well, I'm 100% there,

26:59.650 --> 27:02.484
and I'm tired of you telling me
you're the same.

27:11.128 --> 27:12.528
<i>♪ Revvin' up your engine ♪</i>

27:12.563 --> 27:14.663
<i>♪ Listen to her howlin' roar ♪</i>

27:16.167 --> 27:21.103
<i>♪ Highway to the danger zone ♪</i>

27:22.640 --> 27:24.139
Louis.

27:24.175 --> 27:25.140
What are you doing here?

27:25.176 --> 27:26.386
What do you think
I'm doing here?

27:26.410 --> 27:27.521
I'm getting rid of that
malicious rumor

27:27.545 --> 27:29.845
you tried to spread
about Mitzy and Drake.

27:31.082 --> 27:32.548
Louis, you're right, okay?

27:32.583 --> 27:34.149
I was just jealous of you.

27:34.185 --> 27:35.495
There's nothing going on
between them,

27:35.519 --> 27:36.530
so why don't we just
get some ice cream?

27:36.554 --> 27:37.519
Because I'm
lactose intolerant,

27:37.555 --> 27:38.854
and you know it.

27:38.889 --> 27:41.256
I didn't come here so I
could leave five seconds later.

27:41.292 --> 27:42.458
I came to learn the truth.

27:42.493 --> 27:43.726
Is Mitzy here?

27:43.761 --> 27:45.794
- Louis--
- I said, is she goddamn here?

27:47.431 --> 27:48.530
She's upstairs.

27:50.101 --> 27:51.111
Louis, wait,
I can come with you.

27:51.135 --> 27:53.235
I don't need
my little sister escorting me.

27:53.270 --> 27:54.336
Leave me alone.

27:59.443 --> 28:01.377
- Mitzy?
- Dude, shut the freaking door.

28:01.412 --> 28:02.711
Sorry.

28:02.747 --> 28:04.291
Not for nothing,
but First Lady Nancy Reagan

28:04.315 --> 28:06.181
says "Just say no."

28:09.253 --> 28:10.586
- Oh, Louis?
- Mitzy?

28:10.621 --> 28:12.121
What are you doing here?

28:12.156 --> 28:14.423
I heard a horrible rumor
about you and Drake,

28:14.458 --> 28:15.702
and I didn't want to believe
it was true,

28:15.726 --> 28:17.192
but I had to find out.

28:18.696 --> 28:20.596
L-Louis, it's not a rumor.

28:20.631 --> 28:22.364
I-I've been seeing Drake.

28:22.400 --> 28:24.266
I-I don't understand.

28:24.301 --> 28:26.702
Why would you date
two guys at the same time?

28:26.737 --> 28:28.504
Because my parents
wouldn't approve of him,

28:28.539 --> 28:30.773
but they do approve of you.

28:32.743 --> 28:34.421
They think you're with me
right now, don't they?

28:34.445 --> 28:35.344
But the truth is,
you're with him,

28:35.379 --> 28:36.311
and he's in that bedroom
right now.

28:36.347 --> 28:37.713
- Ah, Louis--
- Well, I guess

28:37.748 --> 28:39.848
I don't have to worry
about it being a rumor anymore.

28:39.884 --> 28:41.450
Uh, wait!
I just need to know

28:41.485 --> 28:42.629
for our plans tomorrow night.

28:42.653 --> 28:44.186
Are we still on?

28:44.221 --> 28:45.732
Mitzy, if you think
you can say something

28:45.756 --> 28:47.389
that'll get me to forgive you,
I'm--

28:51.829 --> 28:53.462
I'll see you at 6:30.

28:56.500 --> 28:57.533
Hey, Litt,

28:57.568 --> 28:59.168
how's it feel, finding out

28:59.203 --> 29:00.636
your girlfriend's
with the Snake?

29:00.671 --> 29:02.671
Say one more word
to my brother

29:02.707 --> 29:04.907
and I will knock
your goddamn head off.

29:04.942 --> 29:06.241
All right.

29:06.277 --> 29:07.710
Come on, Louis.

29:07.745 --> 29:09.745
Let's go home.

29:09.780 --> 29:11.814
Thanks, Esther.

29:11.849 --> 29:13.215
Hey,

29:13.250 --> 29:14.261
you think maybe
we could stop for

29:14.285 --> 29:16.418
a soda or something
along the way?

29:16.454 --> 29:18.420
Of course we can.

29:23.594 --> 29:26.295
Went out 17 more times
after that.

29:26.330 --> 29:28.163
I kept hoping
that something would happen,

29:28.199 --> 29:29.131
but nothing ever did.

29:29.166 --> 29:30.666
I'm proud of you, Louis.

29:30.701 --> 29:33.235
It took a lot of courage
to tell me that.

29:33.270 --> 29:34.336
Yeah, but for what?

29:34.371 --> 29:35.137
For one thing,

29:35.172 --> 29:36.505
now I understand

29:36.540 --> 29:37.306
why you go after

29:37.341 --> 29:38.807
the unattainable woman.

29:38.843 --> 29:41.243
You're titillated by
what you cannot have.

29:41.278 --> 29:42.511
But I can have her, doc.

29:42.546 --> 29:44.847
You can, Louis,
but at what cost?

29:44.882 --> 29:48.250
Because the only circumstances
under which you can have her

29:48.285 --> 29:51.186
are if you choose
to be the bad boy.

29:51.222 --> 29:52.855
What if I want
to be the bad boy?

29:52.890 --> 29:54.957
I am very happy
to say, my friend,

29:54.992 --> 29:57.960
we both know that is not you.

30:05.402 --> 30:08.537
- Hey.
- Hey.

30:08.572 --> 30:10.005
Can I talk to you
about something?

30:10.040 --> 30:14.443
Eh, you mean about
the beating we took?

30:14.478 --> 30:15.811
No.

30:15.846 --> 30:18.413
I mean about this.

30:21.752 --> 30:22.996
Mike, if this is true,
we don't have to

30:23.020 --> 30:24.586
compromise with Oliver
at all.

30:24.622 --> 30:25.999
That's what I want
to talk to you about.

30:26.023 --> 30:28.824
I went to see Oliver
after the deposition.

30:28.859 --> 30:30.559
He wouldn't listen,
and he wouldn't

30:30.594 --> 30:31.727
agree to our last offer.

30:31.762 --> 30:32.861
So what's the problem?

30:32.897 --> 30:34.363
The problem is, he's right.

30:34.398 --> 30:36.565
I screwed him over
on that prison case,

30:36.600 --> 30:38.400
and I've broken
every single promise

30:38.435 --> 30:40.235
I've ever made to him.

30:40.271 --> 30:42.004
Mike, you can't keep that
from our client.

30:42.039 --> 30:43.238
That's malpractice.

30:43.274 --> 30:44.239
You have to use it.

30:44.275 --> 30:46.575
I know, I know.

30:46.610 --> 30:50.646
It's just, he really
reminds me of me.

30:50.681 --> 30:51.881
And the world's a tough place.

30:51.916 --> 30:53.582
I don't want
to break his spirit.

30:53.617 --> 30:55.584
If you ask me,
in the long run,

30:55.619 --> 30:56.451
you'll break his spirit
even more

30:56.487 --> 30:58.020
if you go easy on him.

30:59.690 --> 31:01.401
That sounds like something
Harvey would say.

31:01.425 --> 31:02.724
Maybe, but it also sounds

31:02.760 --> 31:05.527
like something
my dad would say,

31:05.563 --> 31:07.529
and look at how I turned out.

31:09.433 --> 31:10.844
I'll do it for you,
if it makes it easier.

31:10.868 --> 31:12.768
No.

31:12.803 --> 31:15.070
No, if somebody's
gonna do it,

31:15.105 --> 31:16.939
it needs to be me.

31:28.986 --> 31:31.720
He's gonna thank you,
you know.

31:31.755 --> 31:33.789
You talking about Vic?

31:33.824 --> 31:36.291
I know it wasn't today,
and it won't be tomorrow,

31:36.327 --> 31:39.795
but someday, he's gonna be
enjoying his retirement,

31:39.830 --> 31:41.430
and he'll pick up the phone

31:41.465 --> 31:43.098
and thank you
for not letting him

31:43.133 --> 31:44.633
drain his life savings

31:44.668 --> 31:46.435
to hold onto the past.

31:46.470 --> 31:48.904
You think I don't know that,
Donna?

31:48.939 --> 31:52.307
I'm not sad for him.
I'm sad for me.

31:52.343 --> 31:54.309
You thinking about your dad?

31:54.345 --> 31:55.711
I know he's not
a household name,

31:55.746 --> 31:58.747
and I know where he falls,

31:58.782 --> 32:00.883
but after tonight,

32:00.918 --> 32:04.820
his music is never gonna
see the light of day again.

32:04.855 --> 32:06.755
I'm sorry, Harvey.

32:06.790 --> 32:08.001
You want to pour me
one of those,

32:08.025 --> 32:11.426
and we could talk about it?

32:11.462 --> 32:15.130
I don't think
it's a good idea.

32:15.165 --> 32:15.898
Paula.

32:15.933 --> 32:18.300
I told her about us.

32:18.335 --> 32:19.234
12 years ago?

32:19.270 --> 32:20.636
Yeah.

32:20.671 --> 32:21.470
Let me guess:
She's pissed

32:21.505 --> 32:22.671
it took you two days

32:22.706 --> 32:24.072
to tell her the full story.

32:24.108 --> 32:27.109
Something like that.

32:27.144 --> 32:29.511
Harvey, I know
it's not my place to say,

32:29.546 --> 32:31.013
but I'm... pretty sure

32:31.048 --> 32:33.081
if you let her in
on what you're going through,

32:33.117 --> 32:34.816
she'd want to hear about it.

32:34.852 --> 32:36.852
I left her two messages.
She hasn't called back.

32:38.555 --> 32:39.788
She will.

32:46.563 --> 32:48.130
You still want that drink?

32:50.734 --> 32:52.868
Maybe we could listen
to the rest of this together.

32:54.104 --> 32:57.139
That'd be nice, Harvey.

32:57.174 --> 32:58.507
That'd be nice.

33:04.148 --> 33:05.681
Excuse me.

33:05.716 --> 33:07.182
Mike.

33:07.217 --> 33:08.817
We're here to codify
this contract.

33:08.852 --> 33:10.452
Anything you need to say to me,

33:10.487 --> 33:11.698
you can say in front of
my client.

33:11.722 --> 33:13.722
There's been
a change of plans.

33:13.757 --> 33:15.557
- What is this?
- That's a bill of sale

33:15.592 --> 33:17.103
from your food bank
to a co-op across town

33:17.127 --> 33:18.994
for our protein packs.

33:19.029 --> 33:19.962
So what?
It's at cost.

33:19.997 --> 33:21.663
We didn't make
any money off it,

33:21.699 --> 33:22.909
so if you're trying to say
Feed the Heart--

33:22.933 --> 33:23.899
I'm not trying
to say anything.

33:23.934 --> 33:25.133
That's proof that your client

33:25.169 --> 33:27.836
resold our protein packs
to other places,

33:27.871 --> 33:30.005
and that's not permitted
under the original agreement.

33:30.040 --> 33:31.239
That doesn't void anything!

33:31.275 --> 33:32.452
The whole thing is
just an understanding.

33:32.476 --> 33:34.710
An understanding that
you're claiming is a contract.

33:34.745 --> 33:36.089
You can't have it both ways,
Oliver.

33:36.113 --> 33:37.724
Either you have a contract
that you broke,

33:37.748 --> 33:38.892
or you have no contract at all.

33:38.916 --> 33:40.515
Either way,

33:40.551 --> 33:42.651
my client gets to do
whatever the hell he wants.

33:47.558 --> 33:48.657
All right.

33:48.692 --> 33:51.560
We'll take your last offer.
- No can do.

33:51.595 --> 33:52.494
Then the one before that.

33:52.529 --> 33:54.096
No, you'll take
the original offer,

33:54.131 --> 33:55.530
or you can buy
our protein packs

33:55.566 --> 33:56.898
at the supermarket
for all I care.

33:56.934 --> 33:58.667
Mike, you made your point.
You can win.

33:58.702 --> 34:00.013
Please, you have to do
something for me.

34:00.037 --> 34:01.114
I did do something for you.

34:01.138 --> 34:02.215
I gave you two great deals,

34:02.239 --> 34:03.872
and you shoved them in my face,

34:03.907 --> 34:05.173
and now,
I'm doing you the favor

34:05.209 --> 34:06.686
of not embarrassing you
in front of them

34:06.710 --> 34:08.744
the way you tried
to embarrass me.

34:08.779 --> 34:09.945
So why don't you go in there,

34:09.980 --> 34:11.246
tell them you shit the bed,

34:11.281 --> 34:12.581
and then take your medicine?

34:13.817 --> 34:15.250
I knew I was right
about you.

34:15.284 --> 34:17.953
No, Oliver,
you were wrong about me.

34:17.987 --> 34:20.455
See, I'm not 70% there
or 90% there.

34:20.491 --> 34:22.024
I am 100% there

34:22.059 --> 34:24.059
for the client that
I am currently representing,

34:24.094 --> 34:25.726
because I learn
from my mistakes.

34:25.763 --> 34:27.896
You can't play for two teams
at the same time,

34:27.931 --> 34:29.609
and if I had to give you
a piece of charity

34:29.632 --> 34:30.966
just because
you don't get that,

34:31.001 --> 34:32.934
then you'll never learn
a goddamn thing.

34:48.261 --> 34:49.827
Not bad, right?

34:49.862 --> 34:50.944
It was awesome, Dad!

34:50.945 --> 34:52.022
I'll take "awesome"
every day of the week,

34:52.045 --> 34:53.879
coming from you.

34:53.915 --> 34:55.815
But the real question is,

34:55.850 --> 34:57.483
was it cool?

34:57.518 --> 34:58.284
It was
the coolest thing ever.

34:59.787 --> 35:00.886
Gordon,

35:00.922 --> 35:02.788
how'd the session go?

35:02.824 --> 35:05.157
This guy thinks it was
the coolest thing ever.

35:05.193 --> 35:07.159
Well, uh, let me guess.

35:07.195 --> 35:08.828
New sax player?

35:08.863 --> 35:11.130
Vic,
this is my boy, Harvey.

35:11.165 --> 35:13.099
Harvey, I want you
to meet Vic.

35:13.134 --> 35:14.600
Now, let me
tell you something,

35:14.636 --> 35:15.768
there may be some cats

35:15.803 --> 35:16.602
who sell a few more records

35:16.638 --> 35:18.571
than your old man,

35:18.606 --> 35:20.773
but he's still
my favorite musician.

35:20.808 --> 35:22.753
Come on, you're just
saying that 'cause I'm his son.

35:22.777 --> 35:25.011
No, you listen to me, man.
I wouldn't bullshit you.

35:25.046 --> 35:27.179
No, it's people like your dad

35:27.215 --> 35:28.180
drives the world.

35:28.216 --> 35:28.914
I'm just hanging on.

35:28.950 --> 35:30.750
Unless he shits the bed

35:30.785 --> 35:31.684
or something like that.

35:31.719 --> 35:33.085
You know, then I'm done
with him.

35:34.956 --> 35:37.189
Okay, I'm going to
get back to my office.

35:37.225 --> 35:38.524
Not everybody can mess around

35:38.559 --> 35:40.092
in a recording studio all day

35:40.128 --> 35:42.028
and call it work.
Know what I mean?

35:52.974 --> 35:55.308
You were right.

35:55.343 --> 35:57.009
About what?

35:57.045 --> 36:00.646
You told me not to take
that case against the clinic.

36:00.682 --> 36:02.226
You tried to warn me,
and I didn't listen.

36:02.250 --> 36:03.883
You want help
smacking him down?

36:03.918 --> 36:06.052
No, no, I took care of it.

36:06.087 --> 36:07.653
Bet it wasn't easy.

36:07.689 --> 36:08.621
It wasn't.

36:08.656 --> 36:10.034
and I know you've done
the same thing to me

36:10.058 --> 36:10.956
a hundred times,

36:10.992 --> 36:13.225
but I'm just realizing now
it's...

36:13.261 --> 36:16.228
a lot harder to do the smacking
than to receive the smacking.

36:16.264 --> 36:17.897
They oughta put that
on a card.

36:19.334 --> 36:22.301
Anyway, I gotta go.

36:22.337 --> 36:24.136
Mike.

36:26.407 --> 36:28.240
Alex suggested that

36:28.276 --> 36:30.643
we make you senior partner.

36:30.678 --> 36:33.245
We discussed it
and decided you weren't ready.

36:33.281 --> 36:35.014
Why are you telling me this?

36:35.049 --> 36:37.183
Because I might have been
wrong myself.

36:37.218 --> 36:38.329
Harvey, Rachel and I
are trying to

36:38.353 --> 36:39.985
make more time for each other,

36:40.021 --> 36:41.765
so if in a couple of months,
you still feel like

36:41.789 --> 36:43.100
you might have made
the wrong decision,

36:43.124 --> 36:43.889
then go ahead and promote me,
but...

36:46.027 --> 36:48.994
I'm not losing any sleep
over it now.

36:49.030 --> 36:51.330
And I'm certainly
not losing a friend.

36:51.366 --> 36:53.199
Good night, Mike.

36:53.234 --> 36:54.767
Night, Harvey.

37:03.978 --> 37:06.712
Something smells amazing.

37:06.748 --> 37:10.049
I made your favorite.
Linguine with pesto.

37:10.084 --> 37:11.350
My favorite is penne vodka,

37:11.386 --> 37:12.785
but the larger issue is,

37:12.820 --> 37:14.787
what have you done with Rachel?

37:14.822 --> 37:18.391
She ran out
to get some wine.

37:18.426 --> 37:22.094
You mean, she went out
to give us some time to talk.

37:22.130 --> 37:23.763
She did,

37:23.798 --> 37:26.132
because I wanted
to thank you.

37:26.167 --> 37:27.032
For what?

37:27.068 --> 37:28.300
You were right.

37:28.336 --> 37:29.101
If you had rolled over,

37:29.137 --> 37:30.369
it wouldn't have helped me

37:30.405 --> 37:31.971
learn what I needed to.

37:32.006 --> 37:33.706
- Oliver--
- Let me finish.

37:33.741 --> 37:34.818
No doubt, that loss stings,

37:34.842 --> 37:37.376
but today was the first time
I felt like your equal,

37:37.412 --> 37:40.212
and I appreciate that
more than you know.

37:41.949 --> 37:43.827
I guess I'll just keep
treating you with respect

37:43.851 --> 37:45.151
and kicking the shit
out of you.

37:45.186 --> 37:48.087
Bring it on, brother.

37:48.122 --> 37:50.322
Sounds like you two
made up.

37:50.358 --> 37:52.124
Yeah, and I hope you're here
to take over,

37:52.160 --> 37:54.226
'cause I'm pretty sure
the last thing Oliver cooked

37:54.262 --> 37:55.728
was SpaghettiOs.

37:55.763 --> 37:56.562
Chef Boyardee,
motherfucker,

37:56.597 --> 37:57.530
and it was delicious.

37:57.565 --> 37:58.575
I doubt that,
but I don't know why

37:58.599 --> 37:59.710
you're letting Mike
give you shit,

37:59.734 --> 38:01.901
because the last thing
he cooked

38:01.936 --> 38:03.235
was a big old bowl of nothing.

38:03.271 --> 38:04.870
Now both of you,
get out of my kitchen

38:04.906 --> 38:06.172
so I can finish dinner.

38:06.207 --> 38:07.840
Damn, Mike.
She just owned your ass.

38:07.875 --> 38:08.986
Yeah, you should see
what happens

38:09.010 --> 38:10.409
when I don't make the bed.

38:12.013 --> 38:13.145
I'm standing right here.

38:14.315 --> 38:16.248
Thank you.

38:29.163 --> 38:30.963
Hello?

38:30.998 --> 38:32.509
<i>Don't tell me you're back</i>
<i>on Harvey's desk again.</i>

38:32.533 --> 38:33.766
Well, I was just
walking by.

38:33.801 --> 38:35.868
I figured I'd pick it up
for old times' sake.

38:35.903 --> 38:38.771
Ah, you knew it was me,
didn't you?

38:38.806 --> 38:40.840
I assume you want to know
if Harvey got your money.

38:40.875 --> 38:42.074
I know he got it.

38:42.109 --> 38:44.910
I just want to know
how he finally got Vic to sell.

38:44.946 --> 38:46.356
- How did you--
<i>- You really think he could</i>

38:46.380 --> 38:48.414
keep that much work
off the books

38:48.449 --> 38:50.349
all these years
without me knowing?

38:50.384 --> 38:52.117
<i>I guess not.</i>

38:53.754 --> 38:55.287
And the way he got
Vic to sell

38:55.323 --> 38:58.524
was by telling him
the truth.

38:58.559 --> 38:59.992
It was time to move on.

39:01.329 --> 39:03.028
Tell him I said thank you.

39:03.064 --> 39:05.531
- Miss you, Jessica.
<i>- I miss you too, Donna,</i>

39:05.566 --> 39:08.033
and I miss the rest
of those fools, too,

39:08.069 --> 39:10.336
but don't you dare tell them
I said that.

39:10.371 --> 39:12.838
Wouldn't dream of it,
Pearson.

39:14.208 --> 39:15.875
Thanks, Paulsen.

39:25.052 --> 39:26.819
- Harvey--
- I know you need time

39:26.854 --> 39:27.753
to process what I told you,

39:27.788 --> 39:29.154
but I can't wait any more.

39:29.190 --> 39:30.422
I understand that,

39:30.458 --> 39:31.390
but if you're here
to apologize--

39:31.425 --> 39:33.759
I'm not.

39:33.794 --> 39:35.427
I'm here to explain.

39:35.463 --> 39:38.531
I've been going through
something the last day or two,

39:38.566 --> 39:39.643
coming to grips with the fact

39:39.667 --> 39:42.268
that my father's legacy
is going away.

39:42.303 --> 39:44.169
Donna came in
to talk to me about it,

39:44.205 --> 39:47.206
and she helped, because
she's part of my life, Paula,

39:47.241 --> 39:49.875
and I like her being
part of my life.

39:50.611 --> 39:52.177
Why are you telling me this?

39:52.213 --> 39:54.346
Because you say
it's not that

39:54.382 --> 39:55.948
you're threatened by Donna,

39:55.983 --> 39:57.550
it's that
I don't share with you.

39:57.585 --> 40:00.286
Well...

40:00.321 --> 40:02.154
I'm sharing.

40:05.426 --> 40:06.225
I appreciate that, Harvey,

40:06.260 --> 40:07.293
and maybe I didn't

40:07.328 --> 40:08.928
fully share with you,

40:08.963 --> 40:11.063
because I am threatened by her.

40:12.233 --> 40:14.066
And when you kept
those things from me...

40:14.101 --> 40:15.935
It was 12 years ago.

40:15.970 --> 40:17.036
I was a different person.

40:17.071 --> 40:19.471
I've come so far.

40:19.507 --> 40:22.141
I made peace with my mom,

40:22.176 --> 40:23.487
and you're the one
that helped me with that,

40:23.511 --> 40:24.476
not Donna.

40:26.180 --> 40:27.813
And as much as I appreciated

40:27.848 --> 40:30.883
Donna coming and talking to me,

40:30.918 --> 40:33.118
you're the one I want there.

40:33.154 --> 40:35.988
Like I said, I'm not
giving you an apology.

40:36.023 --> 40:39.158
I'm just telling you
where I'm coming from.

40:39.193 --> 40:43.295
So the question is...

40:43.331 --> 40:45.064
you still want to come with me?

40:46.634 --> 40:48.000
I do, Harvey,

40:50.104 --> 40:51.170
I do.

41:04.385 --> 41:06.018
Come on, can't you just stop

41:06.053 --> 41:06.919
going out with
that Litt kid?

41:06.954 --> 41:08.020
He's a loser.

41:08.055 --> 41:09.355
He's not a loser, Drake,

41:09.390 --> 41:10.990
and I happen to like him.

41:11.025 --> 41:15.361
Okay, he's sweet and kind
and nice.

41:15.396 --> 41:17.507
Then why don't you just
go out with him instead of me?

41:17.531 --> 41:19.264
Because he may be nice,

41:19.300 --> 41:20.966
but he's not a bad boy,

41:21.002 --> 41:22.434
and...

41:22.470 --> 41:24.269
I like bad boys.

41:24.305 --> 41:25.638
Yeah, you do.

41:38.719 --> 41:40.452
Louis.

41:40.488 --> 41:42.955
What are you do--

41:48.262 --> 41:49.373
We're going into
your building.

41:49.397 --> 41:50.362
We're going in there right now.

41:50.398 --> 41:52.197
- But I thought--
- You thought wrong.

41:52.233 --> 41:54.066
I'm ready to be a bad boy.

41:54.101 --> 41:56.235
Then when we get upstairs,

41:56.270 --> 41:58.081
you're gonna head straight
for the supply closet--

41:58.105 --> 41:59.638
No, we're going into
your office

41:59.674 --> 42:01.340
with our heads held high,

42:01.375 --> 42:03.575
and we're going in there
for four hours,

42:03.611 --> 42:05.477
and we're not locking the door.

42:05.513 --> 42:07.546
You really are a bad boy.

42:07.581 --> 42:10.082
No, Sheila.

42:10.117 --> 42:10.923
I'm a bad man.
