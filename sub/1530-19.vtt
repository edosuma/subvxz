00:01.359 --> 00:03.931
Previously on Marvel's
Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D...

00:04.000 --> 00:05.968
You really felt nothing for them?

00:06.040 --> 00:07.963
I spent time with Coulson,
he's a good man.

00:08.039 --> 00:09.246
Is that your badge?

00:09.360 --> 00:10.407
They look like coordinates.

00:10.480 --> 00:12.482
Welcome, Agent Coulson.
We've been expecting you.

00:12.560 --> 00:13.641
What is this place?

00:13.720 --> 00:15.484
One of Fury's secret bases.

00:15.560 --> 00:18.291
Eric Koenig, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.,
Level 6.

00:18.360 --> 00:19.361
What about Ward?

00:19.440 --> 00:20.566
He and Agent Hand

00:20.640 --> 00:23.120
should've dropped Garrett off
at the Fridge by now.

00:23.200 --> 00:26.090
S.H.I.E.L.D.'s most secure
facility is vulnerable right now.

00:26.160 --> 00:27.491
Yeah, well,
we're gonna raid it.

00:27.560 --> 00:30.928
This is a hard drive with
all of Simmons' research.

00:31.000 --> 00:32.650
She programed it to erase all data

00:32.759 --> 00:35.127
if anyone other than her
attempts to access it.

00:35.200 --> 00:37.043
You know
what that means, Romeo?

00:37.120 --> 00:38.724
You got your story straight?

00:38.800 --> 00:41.451
I just need time alone
with her to get the information.

01:08.640 --> 01:11.928
Another example of this
administration's lack of transparency.

01:12.000 --> 01:14.571
You can't seriously
be blaming the President for this?

01:14.640 --> 01:16.483
Those who let
S.H.I.E.L.D. operate without oversight

01:16.560 --> 01:17.800
should be held accountable.

01:17.880 --> 01:19.370
If your party
held the White House,

01:19.440 --> 01:21.044
would you be taking this position?

01:21.120 --> 01:23.930
If my party held the White House,
we wouldn't be in this position.

01:24.000 --> 01:25.764
I need a ride.

01:25.840 --> 01:28.764
- Sorry, what?
-I need a ride to Portland.

01:29.880 --> 01:33.407
Sorry dude, I'm not going 200 miles
out of my way to give you a ride.

01:34.480 --> 01:35.527
Okay.

01:35.600 --> 01:37.090
Somehow,
it's someone else's fault?

01:37.200 --> 01:38.406
At the very least...

01:42.720 --> 01:43.801
What the...

01:44.720 --> 01:47.326
All right, I give up. How'd you do that?

01:50.360 --> 01:51.441
Like this.

02:05.960 --> 02:08.770
We cannot allow
HYDRA and their allies to rise again.

02:35.480 --> 02:37.369
I'm afraid this might scar.

02:37.440 --> 02:40.330
Upside, you'll look badass. Dangerous.

02:40.400 --> 02:41.970
He's gonna be fine, though, right?

02:42.040 --> 02:44.486
He will if you back up
and give me some room.

02:44.600 --> 02:45.681
So what then?

02:45.760 --> 02:47.922
By the time we got to the Fridge,
it was too late.

02:48.000 --> 02:50.446
It was overrun. HYDRA everywhere.

02:52.840 --> 02:55.047
We couldn't stop them.

02:55.120 --> 02:57.441
- What were they after?
-Everything.

02:59.080 --> 03:01.651
They took weapons,
alien artifacts,

03:01.720 --> 03:03.210
anything they could grab.

03:03.280 --> 03:05.408
I assume that means
the prisoners are no longer prisoners?

03:07.600 --> 03:09.568
So Ian Quinn?

03:09.640 --> 03:13.326
I'm sorry. He's out. They all are.

03:14.760 --> 03:16.524
And Garrett. Did he get away?

03:16.600 --> 03:18.841
Couldn't stop them from taking
the Fridge,

03:18.920 --> 03:22.208
but I wasn't gonna let Garrett walk,
not after what he did.

03:22.280 --> 03:23.805
Is he the one that did this to you?

03:23.880 --> 03:25.848
He was a tough son of a bitch.

03:25.920 --> 03:28.002
We need to make it believable.

03:29.640 --> 03:31.165
Was? Past tense?

03:31.240 --> 03:32.810
As soon as I had the upper hand,

03:32.880 --> 03:35.247
I put two in the back of his head.

03:35.360 --> 03:37.328
- Good.
-One from me.

03:37.960 --> 03:39.007
One from you.

03:39.080 --> 03:40.764
I would have emptied the mag.

03:40.840 --> 03:41.841
You're all set.

03:41.920 --> 03:44.651
Well, I mean, as set as you can be
with two cracked ribs,

03:44.720 --> 03:46.210
and a zygomatic fracture.

03:46.280 --> 03:48.123
Uh, for those of you that don't know
what that is...

03:48.200 --> 03:50.282
That's a hairline fracture
to the cheekbone.

03:50.360 --> 03:53.284
Your body needs time to heal.

03:53.360 --> 03:55.010
Please, take some time.

03:55.080 --> 03:57.242
Understood. Thanks.

03:58.040 --> 03:59.041
Ah.

03:59.680 --> 04:02.331
One small victory,
HYDRA didn't get their hands on this.

04:02.400 --> 04:03.526
A hard drive?

04:03.600 --> 04:05.329
It's all the research
our team's ever done,

04:05.400 --> 04:07.846
downloaded off the plane
and encrypted for safekeeping.

04:07.920 --> 04:10.730
We should probably back it up
now that we're in a secure facility.

04:10.800 --> 04:12.962
First, Skye, I need you
on threat assessment.

04:13.040 --> 04:14.883
Pull up a list of all the inmates
at the Fridge.

04:14.960 --> 04:17.531
I wanna know just how bad this is.

04:18.440 --> 04:19.964
This is really, really bad.

04:20.040 --> 04:23.761
Quinn is the least scary of the bunch,
and he shot me twice.

04:23.840 --> 04:25.365
Quinn's more a sociopath.

04:25.440 --> 04:27.761
A lot of those inmates
are full-blown psychopaths.

04:27.840 --> 04:29.285
Violent. Impulsive.

04:29.360 --> 04:31.601
And some with superpowers. Lovely.

04:32.320 --> 04:34.209
Is Marcus Daniels on the list?

04:42.920 --> 04:43.967
That's him.

04:45.120 --> 04:46.485
Cross check the list of inmates

04:46.560 --> 04:48.881
with crime databases, recent activity.

04:48.960 --> 04:50.610
Got a feeling we'll be seeing
a slight uptick.

04:50.680 --> 04:51.886
Okay, but that'll take time

04:51.960 --> 04:54.088
and more computing power
than my laptop.

04:54.160 --> 04:55.730
Agent Koenig probably
has some sort of...

04:55.800 --> 04:57.245
I'm sure he'll lend a hand.

04:57.760 --> 05:00.331
The plane you flew in on,
is it operational?

05:00.400 --> 05:02.767
Yeah. You need me to pilot?

05:02.840 --> 05:05.002
You heard Simmons.
You stay and get better.

05:05.080 --> 05:07.287
I'm gonna take a splinter team out
and start going after

05:07.400 --> 05:08.481
inmates on that list.

05:08.560 --> 05:11.006
Starting with Mr. Daniels.
I think I know where he's going.

05:11.120 --> 05:14.283
Uh, you sure it's wise to split up
the team, leave this base?

05:14.360 --> 05:17.284
What if it's part of HYDRA's plan?
A distraction?

05:17.360 --> 05:20.409
She's got a point. I mean, Fury
brought you to this base for a reason.

05:20.480 --> 05:21.561
We're safe here.

05:21.640 --> 05:24.325
Yeah, we're safe here.
But what about everyone else?

05:24.400 --> 05:25.640
People who don't happen to have access

05:25.760 --> 05:27.410
to a top-secret underground shelter?

05:27.480 --> 05:28.481
What about them?

05:28.560 --> 05:31.166
I don't know if it's wise, but it's right.

05:31.240 --> 05:33.925
I'm taking a team and that's the end of it.

05:34.000 --> 05:36.128
No you're not. Absolutely not.

05:36.200 --> 05:38.521
You can't leave. There are protocols.

05:38.600 --> 05:40.250
Since the entire agency's
pretty much collapsed,

05:40.360 --> 05:42.249
maybe now's not the time
to stand on protocol.

05:42.360 --> 05:44.010
Okay, fine, then forget protocols.

05:44.080 --> 05:46.321
What part of "secret base"
don't you get?

05:46.400 --> 05:49.290
Fury said to let you in, and you show up
with a bunch of people?

05:49.360 --> 05:51.761
- Agents.
-Whatever. The point is,

05:51.840 --> 05:54.446
they know where this place is now,
and I don't know them.

05:54.520 --> 05:58.047
HYDRA just released the entire
population of the Fridge into the wild.

05:58.120 --> 06:00.521
There's gonna be violence.
People will die.

06:00.600 --> 06:01.761
And I still consider it my duty

06:01.880 --> 06:03.211
to be the shield that protects them.

06:05.240 --> 06:07.607
Moving speech, truly,

06:07.720 --> 06:12.169
but nobody leaves until
they go through orientation.

06:12.240 --> 06:13.969
Orientation?

06:18.200 --> 06:21.329
All right. Just gonna need you guys
to answer a few questions.

06:21.440 --> 06:24.842
A few psychoanalytic,
non-sequitur questions.

06:24.920 --> 06:25.967
A lie detector?

06:26.040 --> 06:29.362
The lie detector, Agent Coulson.

06:29.440 --> 06:32.011
This baby measures
galvanic skin response,

06:32.120 --> 06:34.566
oxygen consumption,
micro expressions,

06:34.640 --> 06:36.722
biofeedback brain waves,

06:36.800 --> 06:39.280
pupil dilation, voice biometrics.

06:40.000 --> 06:42.810
96 variables in all.

06:42.920 --> 06:44.684
Fury designed this himself.

06:44.800 --> 06:47.280
He wanted a lie detector
Romanoff couldn't beat.

06:48.160 --> 06:50.891
- Did she?
- Like Fury would tell.

06:51.560 --> 06:55.485
Okay, sooner we get this done,
sooner we can get to work.

06:56.240 --> 06:57.571
So who wants to go first?

07:02.520 --> 07:05.444
We're gonna start with some easy
questions and establish a baseline.

07:05.520 --> 07:07.648
Can I have your full name?

07:07.720 --> 07:10.007
Melinda Qiaolian May.

07:11.520 --> 07:13.488
- Eye color?
-Brown.

07:13.560 --> 07:16.291
- You ever been married?
-Once.

07:16.360 --> 07:18.567
- Have you ever been married?
-No.

07:18.640 --> 07:21.246
- Please, list your immediate family.
-Just me and my mum.

07:21.320 --> 07:23.243
So you're not gonna
mention your grandfather?

07:23.320 --> 07:24.765
That's not something I advertise.

07:24.880 --> 07:27.406
Didn't wanna be treated
any different 'cause I'm a legacy.

07:27.480 --> 07:29.926
If I was the grandson
of a Howling Commando,

07:30.000 --> 07:32.048
I'd have that tattooed on my chest.

07:32.120 --> 07:34.248
- What is your first name?
-Skye.

07:34.720 --> 07:36.324
And what is your last name?

07:36.400 --> 07:39.961
Only name.
No family, no family name to inherit.

07:40.040 --> 07:42.168
And you gave yourself the name Skye?

07:42.240 --> 07:47.246
Well, the name they gave me
at the orphanage was Mary Sue Poots.

07:47.360 --> 07:50.330
When we were kids, my brother
and I use to give each other nicknames.

07:50.400 --> 07:53.609
- He called me Lightning Foot.

07:53.680 --> 07:56.411
What's the difference between
an egg and a rock?

07:56.480 --> 07:57.845
Edible. Not.

07:57.920 --> 08:00.287
Well, that's absurd.
The differences are...

08:00.360 --> 08:03.204
innumerable. If you want,
I can start listing them, but then...

08:03.280 --> 08:04.281
We'll be here all day.

08:04.360 --> 08:06.010
Have you ever heard of Project Insight?

08:06.080 --> 08:08.003
- No.
-No.

08:08.080 --> 08:10.321
Ever had any contact
with Alexander Pierce?

08:11.480 --> 08:13.323
I've met him. We shook hands.

08:14.760 --> 08:16.922
Garrett would get a call from him
once in a while.

08:17.000 --> 08:18.604
Said they had mutual friends.

08:18.680 --> 08:20.808
You wash up on a deserted island alone.

08:20.880 --> 08:22.564
Sitting on the sand is a box.

08:22.640 --> 08:25.610
- What is in that box?
-Machete.

08:25.720 --> 08:28.724
A sat phone, so I can call someone
to get me off that island.

08:28.800 --> 08:29.961
How big is the box?

08:30.040 --> 08:34.203
Just say the first answer that comes
into your mind. What's in that box?

08:34.280 --> 08:35.850
Simmons.

08:35.919 --> 08:38.525
That's a hard one. Let me think.

08:39.760 --> 08:41.046
The TARDIS.

08:41.120 --> 08:43.327
I wanna say my laptop, fully charged,

08:43.400 --> 08:45.448
but I don't wanna seem subversive.

08:45.520 --> 08:47.409
- With the Rising Tide and all...
-You're overthinking it.

08:47.480 --> 08:49.448
The laptop would be stupid anyway,
there's no Wi-Fi.

08:49.520 --> 08:51.363
S.H.I.E.L.D. no longer exists.

08:51.440 --> 08:53.920
The Agency has been labeled
a terrorist organization.

08:54.000 --> 08:57.288
So, why are you here?

08:57.360 --> 09:01.604
Honestly, I'm not entirely sure.

09:03.480 --> 09:05.528
We have to stick together.

09:05.600 --> 09:08.888
Keep the people we trust close by.
No one else really.

09:08.960 --> 09:10.962
My grandfather fought HYDRA
back in the day.

09:11.040 --> 09:13.611
The good guys won then.
We'll do it again.

09:14.640 --> 09:15.641
Coulson.

09:16.720 --> 09:18.370
It's the only home I've ever known.

09:21.640 --> 09:25.247
Congratulations, Agent Skye.
Let's go get you a lanyard.

09:31.280 --> 09:32.645
Got my backstage pass.

09:32.960 --> 09:34.644
Piece of cake?

09:34.760 --> 09:37.491
If you don't mind talking about yourself.
So, you'll hate it.

09:37.560 --> 09:38.846
--Have fun.

09:43.520 --> 09:44.931
What is your full name?

09:45.000 --> 09:47.241
My name is Grant Douglas Ward.

09:47.320 --> 09:49.448
Please, list your immediate family.

09:49.520 --> 09:51.682
Two parents, a sister, two brothers.

09:51.760 --> 09:53.444
I don't have contact with any of them.

09:53.840 --> 09:56.605
Boy, your baseline is getting
a lot of spikes. Are you in pain?

09:57.200 --> 09:59.885
Yeah. Only when I breathe.
Two broken ribs.

10:00.800 --> 10:03.406
Okay, well, try not to move,
it may affect the results.

10:03.480 --> 10:04.891
I'll try my best.

10:05.000 --> 10:07.446
Marcus Daniels was an assistant
at a physics lab

10:07.520 --> 10:09.921
where they were trying
to harness electrical power

10:10.000 --> 10:11.525
of something called Darkforce.

10:11.600 --> 10:12.886
Nothing bad ever happens

10:12.960 --> 10:14.689
when you work with something
called Darkforce.

10:14.800 --> 10:17.201
It's a form of cosmic radiation,
pure negative energy.

10:17.280 --> 10:19.442
Unstable, but powerful.

10:19.520 --> 10:21.249
You knew that already, didn't you?

10:21.320 --> 10:25.609
Daniels was exposed, ended up being
able to absorb energy. All types.

10:25.680 --> 10:28.490
But the human brain and the heart
run on electrical impulses.

10:28.560 --> 10:30.483
Exactly. He can kill with one touch.

10:30.560 --> 10:31.971
- I'm guessing he likes to?

10:32.040 --> 10:33.644
Do we need to put a bullet in him?

10:33.720 --> 10:35.484
Unfortunately, it's not that simple.

10:35.560 --> 10:37.847
He can absorb the energy
of most conventional weapons.

10:37.920 --> 10:39.365
He sounds unstoppable.

10:39.440 --> 10:41.647
Like Fitz said, his power's unstable.

10:41.720 --> 10:43.324
Last time, we managed to capture him

10:43.400 --> 10:45.402
by overloading his system
with pure light.

10:45.480 --> 10:47.608
Exposing him to more energy
than he can absorb at once.

10:47.680 --> 10:50.490
I'm sure we can engineer some sort
of delivery mechanism en route.

10:50.560 --> 10:51.607
That's what I was hoping
you were gonna say.

10:51.680 --> 10:54.126
You mind flying,
being the specialist on mission?

10:54.200 --> 10:55.406
Sir, I'll be whatever you want me to be.

10:55.480 --> 10:57.050
That's what I was hoping
you were gonna say.

11:02.760 --> 11:05.843
What is the difference between
an egg and a rock?

11:05.920 --> 11:07.843
Egg's a food. Rock's a weapon.

11:07.920 --> 11:09.729
Have you ever heard of Project Insight?

11:09.800 --> 11:11.768
- No.
-Ever made contact

11:11.840 --> 11:13.968
-with Alexander Pierce?
-No.

11:14.040 --> 11:16.407
You wash up on a deserted island alone.

11:16.480 --> 11:20.405
Sitting on the sand is a box.
What's in that box?

11:20.880 --> 11:22.166
Depends on the island.

11:22.240 --> 11:24.004
Where is it, how big,

11:24.120 --> 11:26.168
what's the terrain, is there fresh water?

11:26.240 --> 11:28.527
Just say the first thing
that comes to your head.

11:28.600 --> 11:30.204
A pistol.

11:30.280 --> 11:32.169
S.H.I.E.L.D. no longer exists.

11:32.240 --> 11:34.527
The Agency has been labeled
a terrorist organization.

11:34.600 --> 11:37.968
So, why are you here?

11:39.200 --> 11:41.328
I'm an Agent. It's my duty.

11:44.520 --> 11:46.727
I need you to give that to me again.

11:48.720 --> 11:50.131
It's my duty.

11:52.360 --> 11:54.488
I'm gonna ask you a follow up.

11:54.560 --> 11:58.963
Agent Ward, are you associated
with HYDRA?

12:01.600 --> 12:02.965
Yes.

12:03.760 --> 12:05.000
We all are.

12:05.120 --> 12:08.966
They've infiltrated the highest
levels of our organization.

12:11.000 --> 12:15.324
Like you mean it. Are you HYDRA?

12:15.960 --> 12:20.409
I'm loyal to S.H.I.E.L.D.,
to Agent Coulson and to my team.

12:22.800 --> 12:26.691
Do you have another agenda here?

12:29.000 --> 12:31.526
I'll give you 24 hours to get
the password and get out.

12:31.600 --> 12:33.329
After that, well,

12:33.440 --> 12:36.171
cross off the team
and bring the girl to me.

12:36.240 --> 12:40.643
Agent Ward, why are you really here?

12:48.000 --> 12:49.081
Skye.

12:51.160 --> 12:53.731
Came back for her.

12:53.800 --> 12:55.768
I wanna spend time with her.

12:58.280 --> 12:59.327
Skye?

13:04.720 --> 13:05.846
Cool.

13:24.720 --> 13:25.801
Hey!

13:26.720 --> 13:27.767
Ward!

13:30.720 --> 13:32.484
Hey. Got my lanyard.

13:32.560 --> 13:33.925
Nice.

13:35.160 --> 13:36.321
So, you guys taking off?

13:36.400 --> 13:39.085
Yeah, I wish you were coming,
instead of Trip.

13:39.160 --> 13:40.764
He's insufferable, isn't he?

13:40.880 --> 13:42.325
- Trip?
-Yeah.

13:42.400 --> 13:43.640
Think the guy's okay.

13:43.760 --> 13:46.570
I know, he's terrible.
He's a horrible person.

13:47.880 --> 13:50.770
You sure this is about him?
Not about Simmons?

13:50.840 --> 13:52.763
What the hell does that mean?

13:54.240 --> 13:56.607
Everything is falling apart around us,

13:56.680 --> 13:58.125
we don't know how it'll end.

13:58.200 --> 14:01.602
If there's something
you wanna tell her, don't wait.

14:03.200 --> 14:06.727
Maybe Simmons should check you
again for a head injury.

14:07.080 --> 14:08.491
'Cause that is not the Ward I know.

14:09.200 --> 14:11.487
You know what? Do what you want.
I don't care.

14:13.800 --> 14:15.131
Good to have you back.

14:20.440 --> 14:22.488
I should be flying this mission.

14:23.440 --> 14:25.647
I made another call. Stay here.

14:25.760 --> 14:27.524
Get the fuel line repaired on the bus.

14:28.280 --> 14:30.726
I remember when you brought
Daniels in.

14:30.800 --> 14:32.609
I know how personal this is for you...

14:32.680 --> 14:35.081
We don't do personal. Not anymore.

14:35.160 --> 14:39.085
Phil, the polygraph cleared me.
I'm not hiding anything.

14:39.160 --> 14:40.764
You mean, you're not hiding
anything else.

14:40.840 --> 14:43.889
Unless you do know who was behind
the T.A.H.I.T.I. Project?

14:44.480 --> 14:47.563
I didn't ask. I was ordered not to.

14:47.640 --> 14:51.247
And you would've done the same thing.
Our job is to follow orders.

14:51.320 --> 14:53.687
It's also our job
to determine right from wrong.

14:53.760 --> 14:55.683
Watching someone in agony,
searching for the truth,

14:55.760 --> 14:58.286
not saying anything? That's wrong.

14:58.360 --> 14:59.441
Look, I was just trying...

14:59.520 --> 15:01.921
Don't tell me it's because you care
so damn much.

15:02.000 --> 15:03.764
Fury's no longer around,
telling you what to do.

15:03.880 --> 15:04.961
So why are you here?

15:05.040 --> 15:07.646
You want some orders to follow?
Follow mine.

15:07.760 --> 15:10.001
Or find somewhere else to be.

15:36.200 --> 15:38.407
How can you be sure
he's going to Portland?

15:38.480 --> 15:40.448
Daniels was obsessed
with a woman there.

15:40.520 --> 15:42.522
He called her his only light
in the darkness.

15:43.240 --> 15:44.651
That's almost romantic.

15:46.400 --> 15:47.640
Almost.

15:48.080 --> 15:50.208
The man's been locked up
in the Fridge for years.

15:50.280 --> 15:51.725
He must be over her by now.

15:51.800 --> 15:53.290
Some people are hard to get over.

15:53.560 --> 15:56.291
Besides, Daniels
is pathologically insane.

15:56.360 --> 15:58.488
Single-minded. Obsessive.

15:58.600 --> 16:00.682
His powers not only robbed him
of a normal life,

16:00.760 --> 16:02.330
they also pretty much fried his brain.

16:02.440 --> 16:03.680
What about the woman?

16:03.760 --> 16:07.082
Audrey Nathan.
She's how we tracked him the first time.

16:07.160 --> 16:09.401
We find Ms. Nathan, we find Daniels.

16:46.680 --> 16:47.761
Audrey Nathan?

16:47.840 --> 16:50.923
What? There's a man after me!

16:51.000 --> 16:53.162
We know. We're with the CIA. Get in.

17:11.319 --> 17:15.290
Mr. Daniels, we don't wanna hurt you.
We need to take you in.

17:15.359 --> 17:17.282
For your safety, and the safety of others.

17:17.680 --> 17:20.286
- It was you. You took me there.

17:25.280 --> 17:27.044
They did things to me there.

17:27.119 --> 17:28.565
They were trying to contain you.

17:28.640 --> 17:31.928
No. They were trying
to make me stronger.

17:34.040 --> 17:35.121
And they did.

17:45.080 --> 17:47.082
Here's where we'd normally call
for reinforcements.

17:47.480 --> 17:48.606
Where did he go?

17:58.480 --> 18:00.960
Here's something.
Police report out of Morocco.

18:01.040 --> 18:04.601
Attempted murder. The victim says
the guy appeared out of nowhere,

18:04.680 --> 18:05.966
disappeared into thin air.

18:06.040 --> 18:08.646
Yeah, you just described
every mugging ever.

18:22.840 --> 18:24.330
Aren't you clever?

18:24.400 --> 18:26.482
Aren't you sneaky?

18:28.360 --> 18:31.523
Using these to keep watch on all of us.

18:33.440 --> 18:34.487
What?

18:34.560 --> 18:36.050
We've been killing ourselves

18:36.120 --> 18:37.645
trying to guess where these guys went.

18:37.760 --> 18:38.807
But what if we could see it?

18:38.880 --> 18:41.804
Get visuals on where the prisoners
went after leaving the Fridge?

18:41.880 --> 18:43.211
That's a good idea,

18:43.280 --> 18:46.011
but right now, S.H.I.E.L.D.'s
sat surveillance is dark.

18:46.080 --> 18:47.730
Ours aren't the only ones up there.

18:47.800 --> 18:51.122
The only other satellites
in the vicinity that could...

18:52.240 --> 18:55.050
The NSA. You wanna hack the NSA?

18:55.120 --> 18:58.681
That's a bad idea, Skye.
That's a terrible idea.

18:58.760 --> 19:01.240
The NSA's already got
S.H.I.E.L.D. on its watch list.

19:01.320 --> 19:02.731
Why poke the bear?

19:02.800 --> 19:05.280
The big, scary, waterboarding bear.

19:05.360 --> 19:07.522
Oh, I thought you were a comms agent.

19:07.600 --> 19:10.809
Not agent of playing
video games while hiding in a bunker.

19:10.920 --> 19:12.763
You can't goad me to...

19:13.960 --> 19:17.487
Can you help me convince
Steve Rogers here to suit up?

19:17.560 --> 19:19.642
Grab his shield. Head into battle.

19:19.760 --> 19:21.808
Okay. Who's he supposed to battle?

19:22.800 --> 19:24.882
If we hack NSA satellites,

19:24.960 --> 19:26.769
we can get footage
from the Fridge breakout.

19:26.840 --> 19:28.842
See who was there. Where they went.

19:30.080 --> 19:32.162
She's right, it's worth trying.

19:34.960 --> 19:36.166
You know, I can't hack the NSA,

19:36.240 --> 19:38.607
but maybe I can upload
the hard drive you gave me.

19:38.680 --> 19:40.364
Get specs on the weapons
they might be carrying.

19:40.440 --> 19:42.283
Absolutely, we should, but we can't.

19:42.360 --> 19:44.328
The encryption is location-based.

19:44.400 --> 19:47.131
We'll have to take a field trip
at some point to decrypt it.

19:50.000 --> 19:53.368
Okay. All right. Color me impressed.

19:53.440 --> 19:56.410
Now impress me more.
Get me that footage.

19:56.480 --> 19:58.050
These are the keys
to the Comm-Sat room.

19:58.120 --> 19:59.201
The mainframe's in there.

19:59.280 --> 20:02.602
Start the hack, but then send
the feed to these monitors.

20:03.840 --> 20:06.286
- Let's live dangerously.
-Yeah!

20:06.360 --> 20:08.567
- How long before you get visuals?
- Uh...

20:08.640 --> 20:11.962
NSA satellites should be tough.
Give me an hour.

20:12.040 --> 20:13.610
Great.

20:13.680 --> 20:14.841
This is exciting.

20:16.360 --> 20:19.330
Let's see if being sneaky pays off.

20:21.560 --> 20:22.925
We should be safe here.

20:23.000 --> 20:26.243
- I thought he was locked up.
-He escaped from prison.

20:26.320 --> 20:28.129
You don't have to worry.
That's why we're here.

20:28.200 --> 20:29.611
We're gonna keep you safe.

20:29.680 --> 20:32.160
"We?" Meaning the CIA?

20:33.640 --> 20:37.645
Of course. That's what I said, isn't it?
We're the CIA.

20:37.720 --> 20:41.202
The Central Intelligence Agency people.

20:41.280 --> 20:42.361
You're not.

20:43.720 --> 20:45.688
You're S.H.I.E.L.D., aren't you?

20:46.240 --> 20:48.811
We're just trying to help.
We're not the bad guys.

20:48.880 --> 20:50.325
I know.

20:50.400 --> 20:53.847
I don't believe what they're
saying about S.H.I.E.L.D.

20:53.920 --> 20:56.526
The Agency saved my life once before.

20:57.200 --> 20:59.487
A few years ago, I saw Daniels

20:59.560 --> 21:01.927
at one of my concerts. Front row.

21:02.000 --> 21:05.209
Then I started seeing him at all of them.

21:05.280 --> 21:07.362
At first, I was flattered.

21:07.440 --> 21:08.965
Cellists don't get groupies.

21:09.080 --> 21:13.165
But then one night,
I saw him outside of my house.

21:13.240 --> 21:15.322
I was terrified.

21:15.400 --> 21:18.051
I begged him to leave me alone.

21:19.520 --> 21:23.366
He just stood there saying,
I was his light.

21:23.440 --> 21:24.965
I didn't understand what he meant,

21:25.040 --> 21:27.327
until he started
blacking out my entire block.

21:27.400 --> 21:31.200
I ran and called the police.
They didn't believe me.

21:32.240 --> 21:34.766
But then a S.H.I.E.L.D. Agent
came to my door.

21:34.840 --> 21:38.049
I don't know why,
but I trusted him right away.

21:38.120 --> 21:41.761
Something about his face.
The handsome part, maybe.

21:41.840 --> 21:46.607
He just swooped in.
It was like out of a movie.

21:46.960 --> 21:49.531
You two were close?

21:49.600 --> 21:50.761
Very.

21:51.560 --> 21:54.564
He promised me he would stop Daniels,

21:55.320 --> 21:57.163
and that's exactly what he did.

21:58.400 --> 22:02.166
That's why I know I can trust S.H.I.E.L.D.

22:02.240 --> 22:03.605
Phil never lied to me.

22:05.120 --> 22:07.566
- Phil?
-Agent Phillip Coulson.

22:10.840 --> 22:12.365
I've heard the name.

22:12.440 --> 22:16.331
Is that... Audrey was... You two were...

22:16.400 --> 22:17.731
- Yeah.
-Okay.

22:17.800 --> 22:19.040
What happened to him?

22:19.120 --> 22:21.361
He died in the line of duty.

22:21.440 --> 22:23.522
I don't know the details.

22:23.600 --> 22:26.251
We were planning a trip up the coast,

22:26.320 --> 22:28.561
and then I got the call.

22:28.640 --> 22:30.165
You must miss him.

22:31.240 --> 22:35.643
For so long after he died,
everything reminded me of him.

22:36.120 --> 22:38.407
I still dream
about him sometimes.

22:38.480 --> 22:40.960
Just us together, laughing.

22:44.320 --> 22:46.971
I wake up feeling like
he's watching over me.

22:48.240 --> 22:49.526
It's nice.

22:52.000 --> 22:54.207
Maybe you should go in there.

22:54.800 --> 22:58.168
No, she's healing.
She's getting on with her life.

22:58.240 --> 22:59.844
We should help her do that.

23:00.520 --> 23:02.807
I think I know a way
how to stop Daniels for good.

23:04.240 --> 23:06.368
But we would have to use her
to draw him out.

23:06.440 --> 23:09.489
No. Do you understand?
That's not acceptable.

23:09.560 --> 23:11.847
It's not ideal, but there's no other choice.

23:11.920 --> 23:14.491
I won't put her in danger again.
That's not fair to her.

23:14.560 --> 23:16.130
But, sir.
I'm sorry, but she's already in danger.

23:16.200 --> 23:18.407
And you said it yourself.
Daniels is single-minded,

23:18.480 --> 23:20.687
he's dangerous. He won't stop
until he gets what he wants.

23:29.160 --> 23:33.051
How's it coming? ls the bus operational?

23:33.120 --> 23:35.043
Still banged up, but she's ready to fly.

23:35.120 --> 23:37.361
The fuel line's repaired
and the tank's full.

23:37.440 --> 23:38.805
What's the range on this thing?

23:38.880 --> 23:40.723
Just under 10,000 miles.

23:45.400 --> 23:46.447
Are you leaving?

23:47.160 --> 23:48.207
Yeah.

23:49.480 --> 23:51.448
I was here for Coulson.

23:51.520 --> 23:53.522
But he can't see past me lying to him.

23:54.720 --> 23:56.688
I get why you did it.

23:56.840 --> 23:58.888
When you get orders,
you don't question them.

23:59.720 --> 24:02.200
You follow them. No matter the price.

24:02.280 --> 24:04.760
Yeah, well this price was too high.

24:05.280 --> 24:09.888
I lost him. Coulson doesn't
want me here. He doesn't need me.

24:13.000 --> 24:14.286
So what should I tell him?

24:14.360 --> 24:17.045
Whatever you want. He won't hear it.

24:41.520 --> 24:42.646
How's it going?

24:42.720 --> 24:45.929
Oh, hey, believe it or not, Skye got us in.

24:46.000 --> 24:49.163
We have access to NSA's
complete sat feed history.

24:49.240 --> 24:52.847
That girl's good.
I can see why you like her.

24:53.560 --> 24:56.848
The images are a little patchy,
but they're gonna clear up any second.

24:58.200 --> 25:01.409
I guess living on the edge
really pays off sometimes.

25:03.400 --> 25:06.131
Yeah. Sometimes.

25:11.040 --> 25:12.644
What if he doesn't show?

25:12.720 --> 25:15.291
Before they put him away,
he never missed a rehearsal, right?

25:15.360 --> 25:17.362
- No.
-Then he won't this time either.

25:18.000 --> 25:19.923
Don't worry. We'll be close.

25:20.000 --> 25:23.083
All you need to do is keep playing
until Daniels gets close to the stage.

25:23.160 --> 25:24.366
We'll do the rest.

25:24.440 --> 25:27.410
Last time, there were
two whole teams of S.H.I.E.L.D. agents.

25:27.480 --> 25:28.606
See up there?

25:28.680 --> 25:30.682
Our best agents are watching.

25:30.760 --> 25:33.206
I promise.
They won't let anything happen to you.

25:33.280 --> 25:36.045
I pulled these
from the jet's power reserves.

25:36.120 --> 25:40.284
Simmons made me wear gloves.
She's so uptight, that one.

25:42.080 --> 25:43.081
Sir?

25:46.040 --> 25:48.122
Good. Can they stop him?

25:48.200 --> 25:50.521
Okay, well this will modify the frequency

25:50.600 --> 25:51.840
and wavelength of the stage lights,

25:51.960 --> 25:54.088
although, technically,
they wouldn't be lights at that point.

25:54.160 --> 25:56.208
- More like gamma rays.
-Tell me this'll work.

25:56.280 --> 25:58.726
I gave Daniels to S.H.I.E.L.D.
to rehabilitate him.

25:58.800 --> 26:00.370
It turns out,
they just gave him an upgrade.

26:00.440 --> 26:03.205
Well, I mean, there's a slight chance

26:03.280 --> 26:05.169
he would absorb the energy
and gain more power.

26:05.240 --> 26:06.287
But it's unlikely.

26:06.360 --> 26:08.283
Who did you say
created this technology again?

26:08.360 --> 26:09.600
Bruce Banner.

26:10.640 --> 26:13.530
Then I'm sure it'll go off without a hitch.

26:14.120 --> 26:17.363
Eric? Eric?

26:23.440 --> 26:24.601
- You did it.

26:24.680 --> 26:27.047
Koenig said you managed
to hack the NSA.

26:27.120 --> 26:30.090
Yeah, it looks that way. Where'd he go?

26:30.160 --> 26:33.130
He's sending everything
over to NATO, CIA, INTERPOL.

26:33.200 --> 26:36.090
Guess he hopes they'll take it
as a sign of good faith from S.H.I.E.L.D.

26:36.160 --> 26:38.288
Smart. Though, looks like all I got

26:38.360 --> 26:41.603
was lots of views of an empty rooftop.

26:41.680 --> 26:42.727
May's gone.

26:45.520 --> 26:46.851
What do you mean gone? Gone where?

26:46.920 --> 26:49.924
She left. I'm sure If I asked where,
she wouldn't have told me.

26:51.360 --> 26:52.600
WOW.

26:53.360 --> 26:55.169
So no goodbye, no nothing?

26:57.040 --> 26:59.088
She never felt anything for us, did she?

26:59.160 --> 27:01.242
She just played us
so she could keep an eye on Coulson.

27:01.320 --> 27:02.970
That was her mission.

27:03.520 --> 27:05.409
Did you feel anything for her?

27:06.760 --> 27:07.841
Um, no.

27:08.360 --> 27:09.691
The only comfort we took in each other

27:09.760 --> 27:11.091
was knowing we didn't have to.

27:11.160 --> 27:13.731
- You can't choose to feel.
-Usually I can.

27:15.400 --> 27:16.765
It's different with us.

27:18.440 --> 27:20.442
"Us" is a strong word.

27:21.400 --> 27:23.482
I mean, I know I kissed you,

27:23.560 --> 27:28.566
but, to be fair, I thought there
was a 97% chance we were gonna die.

27:29.400 --> 27:31.482
- But we didn't die.
-Which is good.

27:31.560 --> 27:33.085
Yes. That is very good.

27:33.160 --> 27:36.164
But there's still no rush
on us being an "us."

27:36.240 --> 27:39.642
It's not like it's a good time
to start anything.

27:40.200 --> 27:42.009
There's never a good time.

27:43.240 --> 27:45.242
We've gotta start somewhere.

27:47.840 --> 27:51.083
You better get going.
Daniels will be here soon.

27:51.920 --> 27:53.763
It's okay. You'll be fine.

27:54.200 --> 27:58.171
Why don't you tell her the truth?
That you're still alive?

27:58.280 --> 27:59.964
Sorry, it's just the way
she talks about you

28:00.040 --> 28:02.520
sounds like you two had something nice.

28:02.600 --> 28:03.806
We did.

28:06.640 --> 28:08.802
So it's not because
you're afraid to talk to her?

28:08.880 --> 28:10.848
I don't wanna hurt her again.

28:10.920 --> 28:15.403
Besides, it's not like I can stay.
We have a job to do.

28:15.760 --> 28:17.205
Yes.

28:17.280 --> 28:19.203
If that's how you felt,
you had a funny way to show it.

28:20.120 --> 28:23.442
Specialists don't spend time
with a lot of people.

28:23.520 --> 28:25.966
The ones we do,
we're all cut from the same cloth.

28:26.040 --> 28:27.371
Black Kevlar?

28:27.440 --> 28:30.967
Trained to get the job done.
Keep emotions in check.

28:33.280 --> 28:35.726
You? You're different.

28:35.800 --> 28:36.961
Different bad?

28:37.040 --> 28:38.121
Bad for me.

28:38.200 --> 28:40.771
I didn't wanna think about you.
I wanted to stay focused.

28:40.840 --> 28:45.004
And then I saw you, after you were shot.

28:45.080 --> 28:46.969
Fighting to stay alive.

28:48.440 --> 28:50.647
But you're right. I'm Kevlar.

28:51.600 --> 28:52.601
You're not.

28:52.680 --> 28:53.886
You don't have to be.

28:54.400 --> 28:55.970
You don't have to shut people out.

28:56.640 --> 28:57.721
Yeah, I do.

29:00.480 --> 29:02.562
There are things about me

29:04.160 --> 29:06.686
that you wouldn't like if you knew.

29:06.760 --> 29:08.683
You think I don't have skeletons?

29:08.760 --> 29:09.761
It's different.

29:10.160 --> 29:11.161
You're...

29:12.600 --> 29:13.681
Good.

29:14.480 --> 29:15.606
So are you.

29:16.280 --> 29:17.406
Not always.

29:23.360 --> 29:24.441
I lied to you.

29:26.960 --> 29:28.371
My older brother,

29:29.480 --> 29:32.051
he didn't beat up my younger brother.

29:32.880 --> 29:34.530
He was crueler than that.

29:36.600 --> 29:38.045
He made me do it.

29:39.200 --> 29:41.965
And I let him. I was afraid of him.

29:42.520 --> 29:43.931
What about your parents?

29:44.760 --> 29:46.250
They were worse.

29:49.080 --> 29:50.730
I am not a good man, Skye.

29:57.440 --> 29:59.090
Yes, you are.

30:03.040 --> 30:05.042
--Mmm.

30:16.000 --> 30:18.606
One of my cuts must've just opened up.

30:18.680 --> 30:22.526
- Let me help. Let me help.
-No, no, no, no. I just need to clean up.

30:54.120 --> 30:55.531
There you are, Eric.

31:51.520 --> 31:54.410
No. Keep playing-

31:54.960 --> 31:58.851
I'm sorry I scare you.
I know that I'm a monster.

31:59.600 --> 32:03.002
But you're the one that can save me.

32:05.440 --> 32:06.726
Come on.

32:36.760 --> 32:37.841
Eric?

32:46.920 --> 32:47.967
That's weird.

33:00.680 --> 33:01.727
Eric?

33:08.880 --> 33:09.927
Eric?

33:28.240 --> 33:29.605
Ward.

33:42.600 --> 33:44.125
- Aah!

33:53.280 --> 33:54.850
--Jemma!

33:58.080 --> 33:59.411
No.

33:59.480 --> 34:00.811
Please.

34:26.040 --> 34:27.690
No, no.

34:30.560 --> 34:32.324
No.

34:35.520 --> 34:37.522
No. No.

34:39.400 --> 34:40.969
- Skye?

34:41.840 --> 34:43.001
Skye?

34:56.320 --> 34:57.890
He's HYDRA.

35:02.680 --> 35:07.527
Okay. Okay. Okay.

35:10.520 --> 35:11.931
Skye?

35:26.200 --> 35:27.201
Oh.

35:29.880 --> 35:33.202
You're safe. I'm still here.

35:33.280 --> 35:35.203
I promise. I'm still here with you.

35:45.640 --> 35:47.324
Phil.

35:47.400 --> 35:48.890
Are you okay?

35:52.760 --> 35:56.924
I thought he was here.

35:57.000 --> 35:59.480
It seemed so real this time.

36:00.320 --> 36:02.402
See what we wanna see, I guess.

36:03.760 --> 36:06.001
I guess so.

36:23.600 --> 36:24.647
Hey.

36:26.240 --> 36:28.129
Think I'd be hiding in a closet?

36:28.840 --> 36:30.729
I was wondering where you went.

36:30.800 --> 36:34.600
I went back to the room,
you weren't there. Why'd you leave?

36:35.560 --> 36:38.291
- Truth?
-I'd appreciate it.

36:39.920 --> 36:41.126
You scared me.

36:44.360 --> 36:46.408
Opening up. That kiss.

36:46.480 --> 36:50.644
Which was a very nice kiss, I admit.

36:53.480 --> 36:55.289
I didn't mean to scare you.

36:55.400 --> 36:57.209
I don't exactly over-analyze.

36:57.280 --> 37:00.489
I just act impulsively
and then I freak out after the fact.

37:02.360 --> 37:03.486
Are you still?

37:18.320 --> 37:21.210
No. I'm good.

37:23.440 --> 37:24.521
I want this.

37:27.280 --> 37:28.361
And you?

37:29.880 --> 37:31.325
What do you want?

37:31.840 --> 37:35.640
What I want is to stay here with you,

37:35.720 --> 37:38.371
and imagine the world outside
doesn't exist.

37:43.320 --> 37:46.085
But the world outside does exist.

37:46.200 --> 37:49.363
I just got word from Fitz.
They need our help.

37:49.960 --> 37:51.450
Bus is fueled up, ready to go.

37:52.720 --> 37:54.051
We should tell Koenig.

37:54.120 --> 37:57.249
I just did. He's headed outside to open
the hangar doors. We're in a hurry.

37:57.320 --> 37:59.368
- I just gotta grab a couple of things.
-Hey.

38:01.080 --> 38:02.491
We need to go right now.

38:05.000 --> 38:08.209
Of course we do.
Lead the way.

38:21.200 --> 38:22.201
Sir?

38:23.800 --> 38:25.165
Is everything okay?

38:27.400 --> 38:30.882
She said I never lied to her. Today, I did.

38:30.960 --> 38:35.124
But she's alive. And safe.
We did that at least.

38:35.200 --> 38:37.248
Why didn't you tell her the truth?

38:37.640 --> 38:38.801
I will.

38:40.000 --> 38:41.764
Someday, I guess.

38:41.880 --> 38:44.326
When there's a chance
she'll understand.

38:48.080 --> 38:50.731
When we get back,
I need to make things right with May.

38:50.800 --> 38:54.850
How can I expect Audrey to forgive me
if I'm not willing to do the same?

38:58.640 --> 39:02.122
I'm gonna check with Trip.
See how much longer we have.

39:07.080 --> 39:09.651
- We need to talk.
-We do?

39:09.720 --> 39:12.121
Agent Triplett thinks
he's done something to upset you.

39:12.200 --> 39:15.044
Fitz, if you're questioning his loyalty
in any way, I can assure you...

39:15.120 --> 39:16.360
It's not him.

39:16.440 --> 39:17.805
What is it then?

39:23.440 --> 39:25.841
You know how I can be.

39:25.920 --> 39:27.490
I hate change.

39:37.760 --> 39:39.569
Where's our bus?

39:40.320 --> 39:41.970
And our team?

39:42.040 --> 39:43.530
I don't know.

39:54.960 --> 39:56.371
It's so beautiful.

39:58.600 --> 40:00.409
So, are we off to Portland?

40:00.480 --> 40:04.326
Actually, Fitz thinks the 084 plasma ray
we found in Peru might help.

40:04.400 --> 40:07.051
Didn't we jettison that to the sun?

40:07.120 --> 40:09.248
Yeah, but Fitz has the specs on it.

40:10.480 --> 40:12.482
- On the hard drive.
-Mmm-hmm.

40:14.320 --> 40:16.926
You need me to decrypt the hard drive.

40:17.680 --> 40:19.603
The team does.

40:19.680 --> 40:23.002
And since it's coupled
to specific coordinates, Agent Skye,

40:23.560 --> 40:24.846
you're in charge.

40:26.000 --> 40:27.081
Where to next?

40:59.960 --> 41:02.201
What are you doing? We have to go.

41:02.760 --> 41:04.444
500 miles.

41:04.800 --> 41:05.881
What?

41:05.960 --> 41:09.123
500 miles and I don't even get
a thank you.

41:09.200 --> 41:11.362
- I was just about to...
- it's too late.

41:11.440 --> 41:14.250
- Thank you.
-I said, too late.

41:18.400 --> 41:22.803
You can call anybody you like. Why me?

41:24.640 --> 41:26.608
I needed someone I can trust.

41:28.720 --> 41:29.960
That bad, huh?

41:32.320 --> 41:33.446
Did you get it?

41:38.760 --> 41:41.969
I may be retired, but I still have contacts.

41:43.840 --> 41:47.242
And my agency hasn't fallen apart.

41:51.080 --> 41:54.562
You're not the only one looking,
you know?

41:54.640 --> 41:56.529
She won't be hard to find.

41:57.280 --> 41:58.441
I know.

42:01.320 --> 42:03.687
You're not gonna take her out, are you?

42:03.760 --> 42:06.969
No, Mom. I just wanna talk.

42:08.520 --> 42:11.444
Good. I've always liked Maria.
