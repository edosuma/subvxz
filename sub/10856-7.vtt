a knife to my neck.

16:19.976 --> 16:23.178
You know, all this time I thought I
was the one that brought us here,

16:23.180 --> 16:25.213
that I did the deal
with Carlos.

16:25.215 --> 16:26.915
Turns out, you've been
a part of this club

16:26.917 --> 16:28.550
before I even knew
it existed.

16:28.552 --> 16:29.784
Are you kidding me
right now?

16:29.786 --> 16:31.753
After everything
I've done for you?

16:31.755 --> 16:33.588
Sonny doesn't
betray Michael, Seth.

16:33.590 --> 16:35.189
- That was Fredo.
- Then explain the knife.

16:35.190 --> 16:36.265
It's a blade, it cuts.

16:36.291 --> 16:38.793
I ditched it at a liquor store
hundreds of miles from here,

16:38.795 --> 16:40.995
and it still found
its way back to you.

16:40.997 --> 16:42.897
Now it turns out Carlos
is the guys who

16:42.899 --> 16:44.532
- gave it to you in the first place?
- No, you're twisting things around.

16:44.534 --> 16:45.533
Well, then
set me straight.

16:45.535 --> 16:46.901
Will you two quit it?

16:46.969 --> 16:48.803
We don't have time for you
to play Cain and Abel.

16:48.805 --> 16:50.738
We just got attacked
by the devil's legion.

16:52.875 --> 16:54.843
We need to find a way
out of here.

16:56.479 --> 16:58.680
Stop! Stop!
It's no use.

There's no way out.

17:05.622 --> 17:07.622
We checked everything
backstage.

17:07.624 --> 17:09.891
There's no windows.
There's no corridors.

17:09.893 --> 17:11.960
Not even an access
to the kitchen.

17:11.962 --> 17:14.229
This place is sealed up
tighter than a drum.

17:14.431 --> 17:17.165
So we're stuck in here with
those... whatever they are.

17:17.166 --> 17:18.900
Well, why don't you ask Richie
what they are.

17:18.902 --> 17:20.768
- He's seen them before.
- In my mind.

17:20.770 --> 17:21.868
Bullshit.

17:21.871 --> 17:23.037
You played me
like an 8-track.

17:23.039 --> 17:24.839
You knew about those things?

17:24.840 --> 17:26.741
I begged you to let us go.

17:26.742 --> 17:27.809
I knew that something
was coming,

17:27.810 --> 17:28.910
but I didn't know
what it was.

17:28.912 --> 17:32.113
How could I possibly know
that everybody in this bar

17:32.115 --> 17:33.181
was gonna turn into a...

17:33.183 --> 17:34.749
They're vampires, aren't they?

17:34.751 --> 17:36.184
No, I don't believe
in vampires.

17:36.186 --> 17:37.919
Well, neither do I,
Richard.

17:37.921 --> 17:39.187
However, setting aside

17:39.189 --> 17:41.789
the sheer absurdity
of this conversation,

17:41.791 --> 17:44.125
they have fangs and they die
when you stab them in the heart.

17:44.127 --> 17:47.829
So I'm gonna go out on a limb
here and say Mexican Dracula.

17:47.831 --> 17:49.764
Except one of them
ate my cross.

17:49.766 --> 17:50.965
Is this God's judgment, Daddy?

17:50.967 --> 17:52.500
Don't ask me.

17:52.502 --> 17:55.837
He's the one with the gift
of sight, apparently.

17:55.839 --> 17:57.505
I think they might be Mayan
or Aztec or something.

17:57.507 --> 17:58.773
- Scott.
- Seth: Wait a second.

17:58.775 --> 17:59.941
What did you say?

17:59.943 --> 18:02.376
Given that we're in Mexico
and all, it makes sense that

18:02.378 --> 18:05.178
- these things might be Mayan or Aztec.
- Huh?

18:05.180 --> 18:06.848
I mean, those guys always
have snakes in their art.

18:06.850 --> 18:10.084
And I read about an ancient race
of bloodsucking reptiles.

18:10.086 --> 18:13.821
They terrorize people,
hunt at the nighttime,

18:13.823 --> 18:16.758
tear them apart
limb from limb

18:16.760 --> 18:19.894
with fangs and scales
and wings.

18:21.063 --> 18:22.230
Just like frog legs.

18:22.232 --> 18:23.231
- What?
- Jacob: Frog legs.

18:23.233 --> 18:24.966
Oh, my God, Scott.

18:24.968 --> 18:27.068
This is from your stupid
wrestling magazine, isn't it?

18:27.070 --> 18:29.103
- Really, kid?
- Actually, the kid's not far off.

18:29.105 --> 18:32.306
Whoa, easy there, Tex.
Put down the gun.

18:32.308 --> 18:33.908
I should say
the same thing to you.

18:35.110 --> 18:36.811
Who is this person?

18:36.813 --> 18:38.846
He calls himself Sex Machine.

18:38.848 --> 18:41.215
- Subtle.
- Excuse me?

18:41.217 --> 18:42.817
He was at the Rattler, too.

18:43.819 --> 18:44.852
He's tried to hit on me.

18:44.854 --> 18:46.020
Is that right?

18:46.022 --> 18:47.321
Now, hold on a second.

18:47.323 --> 18:51.159
The name's Aiden Tanner,
Professor Aiden Tanner.

18:51.161 --> 18:53.427
I'm undercover as Sex Machine.

18:53.429 --> 18:54.328
[Chuckling] You?

You're a Professor?

18:56.533 --> 19:00.201
Yeah. Department of
archaeology, Alamo State.

19:00.203 --> 19:04.005
I was consulting
with one ranger Gonzalez

19:04.007 --> 19:06.140
about a series
of bloody killings

19:06.142 --> 19:08.009
along the U.S. / Mexico border.

19:08.011 --> 19:09.544
And when he left, I realized

19:09.546 --> 19:14.982
he was on the trail of
something... something epic.

19:14.984 --> 19:19.020
So I decided to follow him,
and it brought me here.

19:19.022 --> 19:20.321
Yeah. Okay.

19:20.323 --> 19:21.956
So what do you mean,
the kid's not far off?

19:21.958 --> 19:23.925
What I mean is...
These are Mexican Dracula.

19:25.828 --> 19:27.328
Exactly.

19:27.330 --> 19:28.563
Ladies and gentlemen,

19:38.374 --> 19:42.076
- Serpent.
- Yes.

19:42.078 --> 19:45.246
Now, I've been studying
this cult for over 10 years.

19:45.248 --> 19:49.116
They worship the Vision Serpent.

19:51.253 --> 19:53.988
This is their territory.

19:54.744 --> 19:55.944
_

19:56.192 --> 19:58.059
Their glyphs
are all over these walls.

19:58.061 --> 20:00.328
I mean, I've... I've seen
their writings before,

20:00.330 --> 20:02.630
but never anything like this.

[Panting]

[Bullets clinking]

20:23.953 --> 20:28.222
This place is a source of
immense power for these people.

20:28.224 --> 20:29.290
People?

20:29.292 --> 20:31.425
When they want to be.

20:33.128 --> 20:35.963
A lot of what we hear
about vampires

20:35.965 --> 20:38.933
comes from the Spanish
missionaries' misconceptions

20:38.935 --> 20:40.101
about these <i>Culebras</i>.

20:40.103 --> 20:41.636
They had most of it
right,

20:41.638 --> 20:44.005
but these puppies
are more snake than bat.

20:44.007 --> 20:45.940
Check this out.

20:45.942 --> 20:48.042
Venom glands. [Chuckles]

20:48.044 --> 20:49.310
And look at this.

20:51.179 --> 20:53.648
[Grunting]

20:53.650 --> 20:55.149
See the fangs?

20:55.151 --> 20:56.651
Conical in shape.

20:56.653 --> 20:59.120
And they fold up
against the gums, right?

20:59.122 --> 21:02.156
'Cause they hinge
down like a snake.

21:02.158 --> 21:03.457
- That's insane.
- Yeah.

21:03.459 --> 21:05.359
Well, the codices say
that these guys

21:05.361 --> 21:07.161
are descendants
from the mistress,

21:07.163 --> 21:10.331
who was a nice young lady
that the snake God

21:10.333 --> 21:13.668
transformed into
a bloodsucking demi-Goddess.

21:13.670 --> 21:16.070
Just think succubus.

21:16.072 --> 21:21.075
But then, neither she
nor these <i>Culebras</i>

21:21.077 --> 21:22.677
are supposed to exist.

21:22.679 --> 21:24.278
Yeah, well, it's been
that kind of day.

21:24.280 --> 21:26.347
- [Hisses]
- Ooh.

21:28.083 --> 21:30.418
We better make sure
these things are dead.

21:30.420 --> 21:33.454
I mean, really, really dead.

21:33.456 --> 21:35.356
[Growls]

21:38.694 --> 21:40.194
Makes sense.

21:40.196 --> 21:44.265
Destroying the blood organ
kills them.

21:44.267 --> 21:46.467
You know what to do.

22:44.159 --> 22:47.061
You said you handled <i>El rinche.</i>

22:47.063 --> 22:48.295
I did.

22:50.499 --> 22:52.500
This wasn't supposed
to be like this.

22:52.502 --> 22:54.301
I can fix it.

22:55.504 --> 22:58.039
The counselors
are already downstairs.

22:58.041 --> 23:00.474
- They can wait.
- [Gulps]

23:02.544 --> 23:04.545
[Breathing heavily]

23:06.548 --> 23:10.151
So, this mistress, is that
Santanico Pandemonium?

23:10.153 --> 23:11.519
I don't know.
Could be.

23:11.521 --> 23:13.387
I mean, she sure put the hurt
on them bikers,

23:13.389 --> 23:15.556
squashed them like they
were little cockroaches.

23:15.558 --> 23:17.792
Well, Professor, unlike you,
my brother here

23:17.794 --> 23:20.094
has had a little field research
on the subject.

23:20.096 --> 23:21.595
So, how about it, Richie?

23:21.597 --> 23:23.197
Why don't you tell us all about
your little dancing queen?

23:24.299 --> 23:27.401
I can't reach him. [Breathing heavily]

23:27.403 --> 23:29.603
He's blocking me.

23:29.605 --> 23:32.173
- The trust is broken.
- Then trust me.

No more mistakes.

23:51.560 --> 23:53.327
Who is she?

23:53.329 --> 23:55.096
You told me she led you here.

23:55.098 --> 23:57.231
She wanted me
to set her free...

23:57.233 --> 23:59.133
By killing her, I think.

23:59.135 --> 24:00.434
You killing her or her killing us?

24:00.436 --> 24:01.602
I don't know.

24:01.604 --> 24:03.337
I could feel her inside my head,

24:03.339 --> 24:04.839
and she was pulling me close.

24:04.841 --> 24:07.441
And, yeah, I think it was to this place.

24:07.443 --> 24:09.276
What do they want?

24:09.278 --> 24:12.313
Knowing that could help us
figure a way out of here.

24:12.315 --> 24:15.850
Maybe us being here
pissed them off.

24:15.852 --> 24:17.518
Doubt it. You seen the signs outside?

24:17.520 --> 24:19.553
This entire club is designed
to lure people in.

24:19.555 --> 24:20.588
And keep them here.

24:20.590 --> 24:24.191
What is this place?

24:24.193 --> 24:27.461
Well, from the markings
on these walls,

24:28.325 --> 24:31.525
I'd say this bar was
built on top of a temple

24:31.601 --> 24:34.635
like the Spanish conquistadors
did with Tenochtitlan.

24:34.637 --> 24:39.440
Okay, Indy-with-a-cock-gun,
what kind of temple?

24:39.442 --> 24:42.143
The kind where people come

24:42.145 --> 24:44.445
and make offerings to the vision serpent.

24:44.447 --> 24:46.380
Blood offerings?

24:48.583 --> 24:50.618
If it's blood that they want...

24:50.620 --> 24:53.554
They're gonna want more soon.

24:54.623 --> 24:56.290
She's right.

24:56.292 --> 24:59.627
The glyphs are right here on the walls.

24:59.629 --> 25:03.597
Ugh, these ancient pre-Mayan
cultures are amazing engineers!

25:03.599 --> 25:06.433
This isn't just a bar on a temple.

25:07.602 --> 25:13.507
This place is a giant people juicer.

25:13.509 --> 25:15.176
People juicer?

25:16.311 --> 25:17.912
For who?

25:29.625 --> 25:31.793
[Indistinct conversations]

25:31.961 --> 25:35.830
Tanner: If this is a feeding
under naturalistic conditions,

25:35.832 --> 25:39.934
then their nutritional
autonomy might be hierarchical.

25:39.936 --> 25:42.136
Okay. Okay. English, Professor, please.

25:42.138 --> 25:45.507
What I mean is, there's a pecking order.

25:51.914 --> 25:55.116
Gentlemen, thank you for waiting.

25:55.118 --> 25:57.752
To the nine lords of the night

25:57.754 --> 26:01.055
and our guests, their counselors.

26:01.057 --> 26:02.790
All: <i>Salud!</i>

26:02.792 --> 26:05.059
One group ravages the herd

26:05.061 --> 26:08.530
and sends the prime cuts to the next group.

26:09.932 --> 26:11.733
<i>Por favor.</i>

Hookers feed the pimps,
pimps feed the capos,

26:16.239 --> 26:18.072
capos feed the bosses. I get it.

26:18.074 --> 26:20.208
What I don't get is how do we shut it down?

26:20.210 --> 26:21.743
I don't know.

26:25.147 --> 26:26.948
Fresh catch.

on the menu, though.

26:30.987 --> 26:32.186
Seriously, dude?

26:32.188 --> 26:33.955
You need a PHD to figure that out?

26:33.957 --> 26:35.256
You're one rude little bastard.

26:35.258 --> 26:37.058
What did you call him?

26:37.060 --> 26:40.261
All right. Just relax.
Everybody take it easy, okay?

26:40.263 --> 26:42.931
Now, look, I get that we're all

26:42.933 --> 26:44.832
a ragtag bunch of ramblers here.

26:44.834 --> 26:49.003
But my guess is tonight's not
gonna have a Scooby-Doo ending.

26:49.005 --> 26:51.739
So whatever beefs we got, forget them,

26:51.741 --> 26:53.174
or else we're all gonna get juiced.

26:53.176 --> 26:55.743
Or worse off, end up like
the Cisco kid did earlier.

26:55.745 --> 26:57.712
Yeah, where is ranger Gonzalez?

26:57.714 --> 26:59.180
- What happen...
- Forget him.

26:59.182 --> 27:01.316
Let's just worry about the next wave.

27:02.851 --> 27:04.919
Hope you're hungry.

27:07.122 --> 27:08.890
We need a plan.

27:10.153 --> 27:11.157
That's easy.

27:14.730 --> 27:17.932
Grab as many shotguns, knives,
and wooden stakes as you can.

27:17.934 --> 27:20.735
That way, when those
bloodsuckers come back,

27:20.737 --> 27:22.937
even if we can't kill them,

27:22.939 --> 27:25.139
we will make them wish
they were never unborn.

27:26.275 --> 27:28.242
We're gonna need a better plan than that.

27:28.244 --> 27:30.178
You got one?

27:30.180 --> 27:32.180
It's coming to me.

27:59.309 --> 28:02.176
Tell us a story while
we wait for the mistress.

28:02.178 --> 28:05.780
My stories are more of a bedtime tale

28:05.782 --> 28:08.950
compared to your epic novellas.

28:08.952 --> 28:10.385
[Chuckles] I don't know.

28:10.387 --> 28:13.054
I think everyone will love this one.

28:13.056 --> 28:14.789
I'll help you begin.

28:14.791 --> 28:16.057
Once upon a time,

28:16.059 --> 28:18.893
there was a sad excuse of an errand boy

28:18.895 --> 28:24.265
who had one simple task... to serve.

28:24.267 --> 28:27.068
But instead, he led a <i>pinche rinche</i>

28:27.070 --> 28:28.970
to the foot of our table.

28:28.972 --> 28:30.304
Well, he's gone now.

28:30.306 --> 28:32.306
Ah, ah, ah, ah. Don't interrupt.

trail of <i>los hermanos</i> Gecko,

Is that worth the chance of exposing us,

28:46.856 --> 28:49.891
all of us, for your own profit?

28:49.893 --> 28:51.225
Hmm?

29:03.239 --> 29:06.240
you are the lowest of all.

29:55.058 --> 29:59.227
get us all the way across
the border for what?

30:01.130 --> 30:03.097
To get served up on a
goddamn silver platter.

30:03.099 --> 30:04.532
- Seth.
- I mean, was that the plan?

Keep the money for
yourself, let us get eaten?

30:07.904 --> 30:09.337
Hmm?

30:09.339 --> 30:11.272
- I didn't have a plan.
- Apparently.

30:11.274 --> 30:13.407
You were in charge, which you
reminded me of every five seconds.

30:13.409 --> 30:15.042
36 jobs.

30:15.044 --> 30:17.178
35. You did the last
one without me, big papa,

30:17.180 --> 30:18.913
and it got you tossed in the can.

30:18.915 --> 30:20.448
Yeah, where I still put this together,

30:20.450 --> 30:22.917
and I dragged you out of
your little unabomber shack.

30:22.919 --> 30:24.118
You remember that?

30:24.120 --> 30:26.921
Or was that part of the act, too?

30:26.923 --> 30:29.157
Okay. What is this act
that you keep talking about?

30:29.159 --> 30:31.125
Greatest long con in history, I guess.

30:31.127 --> 30:32.326
You pulled it on me.

30:32.328 --> 30:33.528
And I consider myself

30:33.530 --> 30:36.130
to be the Picasso of bullshit artists.

30:36.132 --> 30:40.101
But you... you painted
a goddamn Rivera mural.

30:40.103 --> 30:41.936
You're so up your own ass right now.

30:41.938 --> 30:43.304
Yeah, well, I was an easy target.

30:43.306 --> 30:45.039
An easy target.

30:45.041 --> 30:46.941
In a million years, I never
could have seen this coming.

30:46.943 --> 30:50.044
- Yeah. Why's that?
- Because I'm your brother, Richard.

30:50.046 --> 30:51.379
I'm your brother.

30:53.248 --> 30:55.383
You know, you're right.

30:55.385 --> 30:57.051
We have a sacred bond.

30:57.053 --> 30:59.487
Yeah, real sacred. Not to you.

30:59.489 --> 31:01.489
Wave $20 million in front of your face,

31:01.491 --> 31:02.957
all that goes away, right?

31:02.959 --> 31:05.059
Don't you mean $16 million?

31:05.061 --> 31:08.062
Our take was $20 mil.

31:08.064 --> 31:10.097
Did you think that I wasn't gonna find out

31:10.099 --> 31:11.499
about the missing $4 million?

31:11.501 --> 31:12.533
What are you talking about?

31:12.535 --> 31:14.202
Okay. Let's imagine
the most expensive

31:14.204 --> 31:15.303
pineapple burger ever made.

31:17.172 --> 31:19.240
'Cause that is what you went
to the Big Kahuna Burger to buy.

31:19.242 --> 31:20.308
Am I correct?

31:22.377 --> 31:24.979
Book of revelation didn't
prepare you for this.

31:24.981 --> 31:26.247
But then I guess

31:26.249 --> 31:28.516
you probably chalk this all up to God, huh?

31:28.518 --> 31:31.485
Actually, I blame the Gecko brothers.

31:31.487 --> 31:34.055
I wouldn't be so quick to judge.

31:35.490 --> 31:40.394
There's an old story
about the hero twins...

31:40.396 --> 31:42.463
Very old story.

31:44.200 --> 31:46.400
They descend into the underworld,

31:46.402 --> 31:49.237
and they best the dark lords.

31:50.472 --> 31:53.307
It's in the old book, the
sacred book, the <i>Popol Vuh</i>.

31:53.309 --> 31:55.276
I can't say I've read that one.

31:55.278 --> 31:57.211
I wouldn't imagine you had.

31:57.213 --> 31:59.881
I got my lord and you got yours.

32:01.083 --> 32:02.516
But I believe mine can save us.

32:04.086 --> 32:06.020
Trick is to find the light again,

32:06.022 --> 32:07.488
share it with those you love

32:07.490 --> 32:09.557
before it's too late for all of us.

32:12.361 --> 32:14.262
That will work.

32:14.264 --> 32:15.529
- You all right?
- Yeah.

32:15.531 --> 32:18.032
I'd be better if crazy lizard beasts

32:18.034 --> 32:19.333
weren't trying to kill us.

32:19.335 --> 32:21.335
I know you're scared.

32:21.337 --> 32:23.437
- I'm not scared.
- I am, too.

32:23.439 --> 32:25.306
I said I'm not scared.

32:25.308 --> 32:27.341
Be glad I'm doing something.

32:27.343 --> 32:29.243
Between your praying

32:29.245 --> 32:31.045
and his surrendering to a higher power...

32:31.047 --> 32:32.647
- He froze.
- He froze?

32:33.582 --> 32:35.416
He doesn't have it in him.

32:37.052 --> 32:39.320
He doesn't have what in him, Scott?

32:39.322 --> 32:42.056
[Sighs]

32:42.058 --> 32:43.557
Who'd you really give the money to, Seth?

32:46.161 --> 32:48.062
I can't hear you, brother.

32:48.064 --> 32:49.463
Okay, look.

32:49.465 --> 32:51.065
Whatever you think that you know

32:51.067 --> 32:52.533
about that $4 million...

32:52.535 --> 32:55.069
Do you think that I don't know
that the money is for Vanessa?

32:55.071 --> 32:57.104
Do you want to talk about the
long con and the master grift?

32:57.106 --> 32:58.606
You have to take the prize, Seth.

32:59.641 --> 33:01.375
What were you two lovebirds gonna do?

33:01.377 --> 33:03.177
Go buy that stupid bar in the Keys

33:03.179 --> 33:05.079
- that she's always squawking about?
- You moron.

33:05.081 --> 33:06.447
Do you honestly think that I would be here

33:06.449 --> 33:07.581
if I was gonna bail on you?

33:08.617 --> 33:10.551
Does that make sense?

33:10.553 --> 33:12.486
It was the opposite.

33:12.488 --> 33:13.654
I paid her to stay away.

33:13.656 --> 33:16.257
She was supposed to cross with us.

33:16.259 --> 33:18.159
- You remember that?
- Yeah.

33:18.161 --> 33:20.194
But, no, she didn't. Why?

33:20.196 --> 33:22.096
'Cause I told her I had
to take you to <i>El Rey.</i>

33:22.098 --> 33:23.597
Okay, yeah. Here we go.

33:23.599 --> 33:25.499
Yeah, I gave it up for you.
For you. You understand me?

33:25.501 --> 33:28.235
I said goodbye to my only chance

33:28.237 --> 33:31.105
at any kind of any sane, normal existence.

33:31.107 --> 33:32.506
And for what? Hmm?

33:32.508 --> 33:35.643
So you could get a seat at
the table with these goons.

33:35.645 --> 33:37.244
'Cause let's face it.

33:37.246 --> 33:39.313
That's all they really are, right?

33:39.315 --> 33:40.648
Just another crew,

33:40.650 --> 33:42.483
another version of Bernardo and the Sharks.

33:42.485 --> 33:44.385
The Sharks were Puerto Rican, you idiot.

33:44.387 --> 33:46.220
Was it that piece of ass on stage then?

33:48.123 --> 33:50.257
Oh. That's it, isn't it?

33:51.493 --> 33:53.361
So that's what she taught you
to do with your little knife.

33:53.363 --> 33:54.662
Back-stab.

33:54.664 --> 33:56.330
I'm getting real sick of
you calling me a traitor.

33:56.332 --> 33:57.598
You know, my entire life,

33:57.600 --> 33:59.400
I have felt like I've owed you something

33:59.402 --> 34:02.169
because you pulled me out of
that fire when we were kids.

34:02.171 --> 34:04.338
I'm getting real sick
of paying vig on that.

34:04.340 --> 34:05.740
So what are you gonna do about it?

34:05.742 --> 34:11.212
As soon as we're out of
here, you and me, we're done.

34:15.250 --> 34:18.418
Still waiting.

34:27.462 --> 34:31.532
The lap dog must learn
who he really serves, huh?

34:31.534 --> 34:34.635
[Laughter]

34:35.380 --> 34:36.880
_

34:42.277 --> 34:43.643
[Chuckles]

35:11.406 --> 35:13.307
Sorry I'm late, gentlemen.

35:15.210 --> 35:18.612
Narciso, <i>pero</i>. What's wrong, <i>mi vida</i> ?

35:18.614 --> 35:20.514
Looks like somebody hurt your feelings.

35:20.516 --> 35:21.749
Where have you been?

35:21.751 --> 35:24.785
<i>Qué importa?</i> I'm here now.

35:24.787 --> 35:28.556
And we are gonna have <i>un parrandón</i>,

35:28.558 --> 35:32.359
one you'll remember for
the rest of your lives.

35:33.595 --> 35:36.297
Underneath all your heavy French perfume,

35:36.299 --> 35:39.700
some of us can still smell your fear.

35:39.702 --> 35:41.235
You think I'm scared?

35:41.237 --> 35:42.603
I want to know what you're up to

35:42.605 --> 35:44.505
with <i>los hermanos</i> Gecko <i>y El rinche.</i>

35:44.507 --> 35:45.606
Why don't you explain

35:45.608 --> 35:47.508
how they fit into this special night?

35:49.744 --> 35:51.645
<i>Tranquilo</i>, Narciso.

35:51.647 --> 35:53.848
You'll get your answers.

35:53.850 --> 35:58.686
Because tonight is special.

35:58.688 --> 36:04.391
Tonight... all the little surprises

36:04.393 --> 36:06.393
are gonna keep on coming.

36:16.371 --> 36:17.671
Santanico: It's true.

36:17.673 --> 36:20.541
We put on a good show.

36:20.543 --> 36:24.678
And we have a hell of time, too.

36:24.680 --> 36:28.482
But is this really what we deserve?

36:28.484 --> 36:32.553
To crawl at the feet of our masters?

36:32.555 --> 36:36.590
We are so much more than slaves.

36:36.592 --> 36:39.293
We're brothers and sisters.

36:39.295 --> 36:41.662
We share the same struggle.

36:41.664 --> 36:46.867
And the truth is, they are weak.

36:46.869 --> 36:48.836
And we're strong.

36:48.838 --> 36:50.704
Have you lost your mind?

36:50.706 --> 36:54.575
Do you really put yourself
above the nine lords?

36:54.577 --> 36:58.479
- Santanico.
- [Clicks tongue]

36:58.481 --> 37:00.314
I thought you'd tasted
enough of their anger by now

37:00.316 --> 37:01.315
to know better.

37:01.317 --> 37:02.683
But no.

37:02.685 --> 37:05.686
[Chuckles] Not you. <i>Tu eres necia.</i>

37:05.688 --> 37:08.556
Why can't you accept your lot?

37:08.558 --> 37:10.424
All you and your people
have to do is feed us.

37:10.426 --> 37:12.927
That's all this temple was built for.

37:12.929 --> 37:15.529
The lords are weak, Narciso.

37:15.531 --> 37:17.331
They are greedy and vain,

37:17.333 --> 37:19.533
and no matter how much you look down on us,

37:19.535 --> 37:22.870
we are all still <i>Culebras</i> in this room.

37:24.439 --> 37:25.606
There's a difference

37:25.608 --> 37:27.741
between being a slave in your body

37:27.743 --> 37:29.810
and being a slave in your soul.

37:31.880 --> 37:35.616
We have suffered too long now.

37:35.618 --> 37:37.618
But it ends tonight.

37:37.620 --> 37:40.688
So, you have a choice, <i>señores</i>.

37:42.457 --> 37:44.858
You join us...

37:48.763 --> 37:51.932
And live free.

37:51.934 --> 37:59.773
Or... you die being slaves to the nine.

38:02.911 --> 38:04.712
So, what is it gonna be?

38:08.783 --> 38:10.751
[Hisses]

38:15.757 --> 38:17.591
[Chuckles]

38:17.593 --> 38:19.460
Didn't think so.

38:19.462 --> 38:21.729
[Speaks Spanish]

38:33.875 --> 38:38.646
[Choking]

38:43.518 --> 38:45.886
Now the real show begins.

38:49.824 --> 38:51.992
[Screaming]

38:59.434 --> 39:01.502
[Door opens]

39:19.988 --> 39:22.056
[Growling]

39:29.864 --> 39:31.632
[Hisses]

39:33.568 --> 39:37.571
Six against two. I like those odds.

39:43.578 --> 39:45.679
They just got biblically worse.

39:46.681 --> 39:47.915
Wait a second.

39:47.917 --> 39:49.049
I know that lugnut and his biker chick.

39:49.051 --> 39:50.751
They weren't <i>Culebras</i> before.

39:50.753 --> 39:51.952
Scott: Neither was that perv, either.

39:51.954 --> 39:53.754
Yeah, well, they are now.

39:53.756 --> 39:55.723
[Hissing, snarling]

39:55.725 --> 39:56.990
Jacob: Scott, listen to me.

39:56.992 --> 39:58.625
Don't let your anger get the best of you.

39:58.627 --> 40:00.494
There's a fine line between self-defense

40:00.496 --> 40:02.129
- and depraved violence.
- Dad, I got this.

40:04.899 --> 40:06.800
There are better ways
to channel your grief.

40:08.503 --> 40:09.903
Who says I'm channeling grief?

40:09.905 --> 40:12.373
Right. It's time to ring the dinner bell.

40:14.609 --> 40:18.812
<i>Culebras</i>, come out to play!

40:18.814 --> 40:20.881
[Gunshots]

40:37.065 --> 40:38.165
They're still coming!

40:39.134 --> 40:40.134
Keep shooting!

40:42.070 --> 40:43.937
Ugh, I shot my load.

40:43.939 --> 40:45.639
I'm out.

40:47.008 --> 40:49.843
[Growling]

40:49.845 --> 40:51.545
Everybody down.

40:51.547 --> 40:54.014
[Beeping]

40:58.753 --> 40:59.753
This better work.

40:59.755 --> 41:01.855
It'll work.

41:01.857 --> 41:03.791
[Dialing]

41:03.793 --> 41:06.160
[Cellphone rings]

41:12.066 --> 41:14.701
[Groans]

41:30.985 --> 41:32.986
- Kate: Scott!
- [Hisses]

41:47.669 --> 41:48.969
Ah, shit.

41:59.647 --> 42:00.814
Scott!

42:00.816 --> 42:02.216
[Hissing]

42:39.120 --> 42:40.821
[Snarling]

42:48.696 --> 42:49.763
Scott!

42:59.974 --> 43:01.742
[Hisses]

43:14.689 --> 43:16.823
Seth.

43:17.992 --> 43:19.326
Plan B.

43:21.996 --> 43:23.130
Seth: Hey!

43:30.104 --> 43:31.939
[Screams]

43:37.712 --> 43:39.212
Now, that's one for the books.

43:40.815 --> 43:42.115
[Engine revving]

44:26.961 --> 44:28.295
Are you okay?

44:28.297 --> 44:30.764
[Breathing heavily]

44:30.766 --> 44:31.965
I don't know.

44:39.307 --> 44:41.241
We have to find Scott.

44:44.312 --> 44:49.016
We will, honey. We will.

44:53.021 --> 44:55.956
You can't leave, Richard.

44:55.958 --> 44:57.057
Not yet.

45:11.406 --> 45:13.073
Morning, baby.

45:14.976 --> 45:17.978
Morning.

45:20.014 --> 45:22.215
[Sighs]

45:22.217 --> 45:24.451
I had the craziest nightmare.

45:28.356 --> 45:32.225
I dreamt that Earl got shot...

45:32.227 --> 45:36.096
And I went to Mexico to find these dudes.

45:38.066 --> 45:39.900
There was these things.

45:39.902 --> 45:44.371
Oh. What kind of things?

45:44.373 --> 45:48.208
Never mind.

45:48.210 --> 45:49.843
It was just a dream.

45:49.845 --> 45:52.846
Okay. Just a dream.

45:52.848 --> 45:53.847
Today's her big day.

45:53.849 --> 45:57.250
Oh.

45:57.252 --> 46:01.922
Father Quintana is gonna
splash your face with water.

46:01.924 --> 46:04.257
He's gonna make you street legal.

46:04.259 --> 46:06.059
Oh, by the way. Earl called.

46:06.061 --> 46:08.261
He said he'd see you at
the Place of Dead Roads.

46:08.263 --> 46:11.398
What?

46:12.400 --> 46:15.001
Oh, God.

46:15.870 --> 46:16.970
Oh, God.

46:16.972 --> 46:19.873
I'm sorry.

46:19.875 --> 46:21.108
I'm so sorry, babe.

46:22.110 --> 46:23.410
[Screams]

46:23.412 --> 46:25.312
Aah!

46:38.993 --> 46:41.495
[Grunting]

46:55.209 --> 46:56.910
You belong here.

46:56.912 --> 46:58.912
Somewhere inside, close to the bone.

46:58.914 --> 46:59.913
You know it, too.

46:59.915 --> 47:00.914
No, you don't know me.

47:00.916 --> 47:02.983
That's not true.

47:02.985 --> 47:07.320
I know you better than your brother does.

47:07.322 --> 47:11.057
You tell me, brother. Does she?

47:11.059 --> 47:13.927
I'm in your soul, Richard.

47:13.929 --> 47:16.396
But I don't blame you for being suspicious.

47:16.398 --> 47:18.098
I asked you to trust me.

47:18.100 --> 47:21.001
I didn't tell you what was coming.

47:21.003 --> 47:24.237
I wanted to show you who
I was on my own terms.

47:24.239 --> 47:29.009
The world is much more
complicated than you know.

47:29.011 --> 47:31.945
Richie, look at me.

47:31.947 --> 47:33.213
Don't listen to this.

47:34.448 --> 47:36.116
Don't listen to this.

47:42.223 --> 47:43.824
What do you think you're doing, slave?

47:49.964 --> 47:51.097
Becoming the master.

47:51.099 --> 47:52.165
[Groans]

47:54.135 --> 47:56.570
I taught you how to see,

47:56.572 --> 47:59.172
but that was only the beginning.

47:59.174 --> 48:00.574
Don't listen to this.

48:00.576 --> 48:02.475
I don't want to hurt you.

48:02.477 --> 48:05.245
I need you.

48:05.247 --> 48:06.779
And you need me, too.

48:10.384 --> 48:12.219
You have to let these people go.

48:14.288 --> 48:16.289
Richard. Stop.

48:16.291 --> 48:18.391
Something's coming, remember?

48:18.393 --> 48:19.459
Then let them go.

48:30.404 --> 48:32.405
[Gasps]

48:32.407 --> 48:34.140
[Groans]

48:36.410 --> 48:41.248
[Snarls]

48:52.360 --> 48:54.628
Richard!

48:57.231 --> 48:59.299
Richard!
