10:05.973 --> 10:07.172
okay, lieutenant.
So, I think I get it.

10:07.174 --> 10:08.907
If tamika Weaver
was pretty boy,

10:08.909 --> 10:10.775
and pretty boy was
the third person in the car...

10:10.777 --> 10:14.479
Ye gods. Each one of
these people has 30 names.

10:14.481 --> 10:15.880
Uh...

10:15.882 --> 10:22.587
Daniel price is trigger
is reverend copkiller.

10:22.589 --> 10:25.056
-Dennis price is...
-Klip.

10:25.058 --> 10:25.890
...klip.

10:25.892 --> 10:27.993
Uh...Uh...
Tamika is...

10:27.995 --> 10:29.694
-Pretty boy.
-...Pretty boy.

10:29.696 --> 10:31.896
And, uh, ah -- Buddha.

10:31.898 --> 10:33.698
Well, he has a different name
altogether.

10:33.700 --> 10:37.068
And not one,
but two hickmans.

10:37.070 --> 10:39.904
Louie, those had better be names
on your guest list.

10:39.906 --> 10:41.272
Well, no.
They're murder suspects.

10:41.274 --> 10:43.575
But, patrice,
w-what are you doing here?

10:43.577 --> 10:45.143
I know
that you're at work,

10:45.145 --> 10:47.879
but I am not planning
this wedding anymore by myself.

10:47.881 --> 10:49.347
Well,
of course you aren't.

10:49.349 --> 10:51.516
I-I'm helping.
I-I'm going to, uh --

10:51.518 --> 10:52.984
Louie,
I said, "let's elope."

10:52.986 --> 10:54.853
I said,
"don't spend lots of money."

10:54.855 --> 10:57.522
I said,
"I am not doing all the work."

10:57.524 --> 10:59.791
No, buzz. You stay.
I'm leaving.

10:59.793 --> 11:02.427
You missed the caterer,
so I can't settle the menu.

11:02.429 --> 11:06.698
Invitations still not ready,
despite what you promised me.

11:06.700 --> 11:10.001

not filled out.

[ Sighs ]
Louie, honey, look.

11:13.540 --> 11:15.273
We have our license.

11:15.275 --> 11:16.875
Baby, we can just
go across the street

11:16.877 --> 11:18.243
tomorrow during lunch
and --

11:18.245 --> 11:20.712
I am not getting married
during my lunch hour.

11:20.714 --> 11:23.014
Now, look.
The second this case is over,

11:23.016 --> 11:25.350
I will
take care of everything,

11:25.352 --> 11:31.556
and I will make it so beautiful,
like you.

11:31.558 --> 11:35.427
Fill out all of this stuff
and get it back to me tomorrow,

11:35.429 --> 11:37.395
or we do things my way.

11:37.397 --> 11:39.964
Oh, uh, hi, patrice.

11:39.966 --> 11:42.000
Lieutenant,
if you have a minute, um...

11:42.002 --> 11:43.568
He needs to talk to you.

11:43.570 --> 11:44.602
You just hold on.
I was --

11:44.604 --> 11:46.271
Louie, tomorrow.

11:46.273 --> 11:47.439
Tomorrow.

11:47.441 --> 11:48.440
-Bye, buzz.
-Bye.

11:48.442 --> 11:49.674
-Bye, boys.
-Bye.

11:49.676 --> 11:50.842
-Excuse me.
-Bye, patrice.

11:50.844 --> 11:52.177
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to --

11:52.179 --> 11:54.179
-I didn't mean to interrupt you.
-It's fine.

11:54.181 --> 11:57.716
You probably just ruined
my whole wedding, but so what?

11:57.718 --> 11:58.783
How can I help you?

11:58.785 --> 12:00.719
-Um...
-How?

12:00.721 --> 12:04.823
I...I talked to
m-my other mother

12:04.825 --> 12:06.357
at county last night.

12:06.359 --> 12:08.693
Sharon Beck
won't help you guys

12:08.695 --> 12:10.929
because
her freaky boyfriend, Gary,

12:10.931 --> 12:13.098
said if she did,
he'd kill rusty.

12:13.100 --> 12:14.599
-What?
-O-okay. Okay.

12:14.601 --> 12:17.368
But Gary would never follow
through on a threat like that.

12:17.370 --> 12:19.804
Now we're gonna get this
straightened out right now.

12:19.806 --> 12:23.074
Buzz, I want Sharon Beck brought
over from county immediately.

12:23.076 --> 12:25.443
Thank you, Gus.
Thank you.

12:25.445 --> 12:27.245
Tao: She might have been
Emile's girlfriend,

12:27.247 --> 12:29.948
but tamika was in high school,
just 15.

12:29.950 --> 12:31.850
Found a yearbook picture
of her.

12:31.852 --> 12:34.586
I can see why
they called her pretty boy.

12:34.588 --> 12:35.754
Oh, 15?

12:35.756 --> 12:37.756
Flynn:
Hmm. Underage.

12:37.758 --> 12:40.191
Another reason
why 20-year-old Emile

12:40.193 --> 12:42.260
might have wanted to
keep her out of this.

12:42.262 --> 12:44.295
If tamika was
the third person in the car,

12:44.297 --> 12:46.564
maybe she was also there
when they dumped off the gun.

12:46.566 --> 12:47.966
Let's say she was.

12:47.968 --> 12:50.468
Now, jump ahead
to when reverend copkiller

12:50.470 --> 12:54.205
paid $10,000 bond
to get jon Barnes out of jail.

12:54.207 --> 12:56.708
That is the value of the cash

12:56.710 --> 12:59.611
and the heroin we found
in tamika's car.

12:59.613 --> 13:01.412
Tamika knew who ended up
with the uzi

13:01.414 --> 13:04.115
-and was blackmailing them?
-And got killed in the process.

13:04.117 --> 13:06.451
Yes, that could be a version
of how we ended up here.

13:06.453 --> 13:09.287
Of the three people in the car
when Reese was murdered,

13:09.289 --> 13:11.623
reverend copkiller
is the only one left alive.

13:11.625 --> 13:14.592
But he has an air-tight alibi
for tamika and Emile's murders.

13:14.594 --> 13:15.960
And he eventually

13:15.962 --> 13:18.096
bailed jon Barnes out of jail
on his own.

13:18.098 --> 13:20.198
Yeah, 'cause
he's a merciful Christian?

13:20.200 --> 13:22.867
But tamika was at the church
for taco Monday

13:22.869 --> 13:24.202
not long before she died.

13:24.204 --> 13:25.737
And reverend copkiller
was there, too.

13:25.739 --> 13:27.138
One other thing.

13:27.140 --> 13:29.474
The car that was used
in the Reese murder.

13:29.476 --> 13:31.543
-It was never found.
-Was never found.

13:31.545 --> 13:33.845
Uh,
it's in the murder book.

13:33.847 --> 13:35.346
Yes, it is.

13:37.017 --> 13:39.851
Who do we know
that takes cars apart

13:39.853 --> 13:42.020
and is connected to
the drug trade?

13:42.022 --> 13:44.022
You got me confused with
someone else.

13:44.024 --> 13:47.692
Client's a mechanic.
He fixes cars for a church.

13:47.694 --> 13:49.093
He certainly
doesn't steal them.

13:49.095 --> 13:51.963
What about all those
transmissions he was replacing?

13:51.965 --> 13:53.198
And all those
catalytic converters --

13:53.200 --> 13:54.532
where did they come from,
huh?

13:54.534 --> 13:56.868
-All reclaimed from junkyards.
-Wrong.

13:56.870 --> 13:59.204
They're kind of new.
Those parts look like

what he knows about that --

That's like blackmail.

back then.

He was moving lots of dope,
but also using,

15:23.990 --> 15:26.324
and it made him do
wild things,

with that cop, Reese.

he wanted evidence to disappear.

Gary just told me that
he needed to buy cigarettes.

Ah. So he goes into
the liquor store, you wait.

19:23.763 --> 19:27.665
And then he comes out
and gets in the car

19:27.667 --> 19:29.500

of the robbery --

19:36.109 --> 19:37.542
I knew he was using again,

19:37.544 --> 19:40.444

from the program.

19:44.484 --> 19:46.651
So I told Gary
that I was leaving the next day.

19:46.653 --> 19:48.619
And then the asshole
robbed the liquor store.

where the gun was

he would deal with it.

before we could

in the middle of the trial,

20:40.773 --> 20:42.840
he shot Rachel gray
and Eric Dunn.

20:42.842 --> 20:45.810
Well, that makes for
a credible theory of the crime.

from jon Barnes.

20:50.550 --> 20:53.718
If we could prove that he
murdered those three teenagers,

20:53.720 --> 20:56.120
we could deal him down
from the death penalty

about Dennis price

out of his brother's church,

21:14.374 --> 21:16.407
he may have moved Barnes
somewhere, too.

21:16.409 --> 21:21.178
In fact, if I
rattled Dennis' chain a little,

21:21.180 --> 21:22.546

he'd lead us to Barnes.

21:22.548 --> 21:24.482

how?

21:24.484 --> 21:27.151

and say, "look, if you guys know
where Barnes is, tell us.

21:32.825 --> 21:34.925

about why tamika was shot,

to get Barnes to roll

Hello?

<i> It is at times like these cops</i>

29:21.727 --> 29:23.060
Captain, that was julio.

-Mike, do you have the --
-yes.

Julio has the rest, including
the, uh, charges for the motel.

Lieutenant,
would you care to join me?

Flynn:<i> He went there with a gun.</i>
<i> He shot first.</i>

29:37.476 --> 29:40.878
As I understand it, you arrested
my client for protecting himself

from a man
you told me yesterday

29:44.150 --> 29:47.217
had shot and killed
three innocent teenagers.

29:47.219 --> 29:49.386
Now, my client's
supposed to approach

29:49.388 --> 29:50.788
<i> a man like that unarmed?</i>

29:50.790 --> 29:53.323
Well, he could have
called the police.

29:55.528 --> 29:57.427
-Thank you for coming.
-Peace and out, captain.

That's all
you're getting from me

from my lawyer.

we'll get to that.

you've got Dennis on
a misdemeanor weapons charge

30:21.220 --> 30:23.487
for firing his gun
within city limits.

30:23.489 --> 30:26.490
And for that...

I will gladly go downstairs

and pay the $100 fine myself
to end this discussion.

I'm, frankly, disappointed
in you, captain.

31:05.064 --> 31:06.663
We only now just sat down.

31:06.665 --> 31:09.800
You know better than to question
him without his lawyer present.

31:09.802 --> 31:11.935
We haven't asked him
any questions.

31:11.937 --> 31:13.704
We were just going to
give him a...

31:13.706 --> 31:15.672
Courtesy briefing
on our progress.

31:15.674 --> 31:18.242
Because you're so famous
for your courtesy, lieutenant?

No, it's a trick,
and we're leaving.

-Daniel, let's go.
-I am so sorry, reverend.

31:23.115 --> 31:25.315
I had hoped to be able
to explain to you

31:25.317 --> 31:27.517
why we arrested
your brother today,

31:27.519 --> 31:30.187
but you can hear about it
on the news later.

31:30.189 --> 31:32.055
-What are you talking about?
-It's ridiculous.

31:32.057 --> 31:33.724
I'll tell you outside.
Let's go.

31:33.726 --> 31:36.560
Your brother was in a shootout
with one of your parishioners,

31:36.562 --> 31:40.163
Mr. jon Barnes,
who you bailed out of jail.

31:40.165 --> 31:42.666
What? Peter?
You know about this?

31:42.668 --> 31:45.903
Oh, reverend, that is why
Mr. Goldman is here.

31:45.905 --> 31:48.071
Dennis called me.

31:48.073 --> 31:50.574
He was worried
that you would be angry.

31:50.576 --> 31:53.377
But it was all a trick to
distract me

31:53.379 --> 31:55.512
so they could take advantage
of you like this.

31:55.514 --> 31:57.214
Please, come with me.

31:57.216 --> 32:00.384
And make sure that Mr. Goldman
doesn't forget the details

32:00.386 --> 32:02.252
of how your brother
has been

32:02.254 --> 32:04.488
running heroin
through your church.

32:04.490 --> 32:05.856
Shame on, detective.

32:05.858 --> 32:07.524
My brother's been
on the straight for years

32:07.526 --> 32:10.093
-thanks to the blood of Christ.
-No, thanks to Mr. Goldman,

32:10.095 --> 32:12.596
who's managed to
keep you in the dark.

32:12.598 --> 32:15.966
We found this heroin
in the same motel room

32:15.968 --> 32:17.634
where your brother stashed
jon Barnes.

32:17.636 --> 32:19.202
We just traced back
the credit card

32:19.204 --> 32:21.138
paying for the room
to Dennis price.

32:21.140 --> 32:24.775
And he has several other
motel rooms he started using

32:24.777 --> 32:26.310
right before
we searched your church.

32:26.312 --> 32:27.911
They're
playing a game with you.

32:27.913 --> 32:29.579
I want to listen, Peter.
Let him finish.

32:29.581 --> 32:31.481
-What else?
-Are you really not aware

32:31.483 --> 32:34.418
that Mr. Goldman is
working for your brother?

32:34.420 --> 32:37.220
Of course
he's working for my brother.

32:37.222 --> 32:39.623
Peter works for our church,
our community.

32:39.625 --> 32:41.158
-And my brother obviously --
-seven arrests

32:41.160 --> 32:42.759

in the last six months,

32:42.761 --> 32:45.395
all of them dealers supposedly
working for your brother

32:45.397 --> 32:47.564
and all of them represented
by Peter Goldman.

32:47.566 --> 32:49.132
Daniel, I promise,

32:49.134 --> 32:51.535
I can explain
everything they're lying about.

32:51.537 --> 32:53.704
Then, Peter, please tell
the reverend that 40 minutes

32:53.706 --> 32:57.107
after jon Barnes was arrested
for dealing heroin,

32:57.109 --> 33:00.310
your brother, Dennis,
called your cellphone.

33:00.312 --> 33:01.712
Sanchez:
And you showed up for jon Barnes

33:01.714 --> 33:03.480
and you represented him
at his arraignment.

33:03.482 --> 33:06.316
That's your proof that
I'm involved in the drug trade?

33:06.318 --> 33:09.219
-Really?
-No, not by itself. No.

33:09.221 --> 33:11.388
But we went back
and cross-checked

33:11.390 --> 33:13.457
the other six arrests
we mentioned,

33:13.459 --> 33:18.195
and, as you can see, your
brother called Mr. Goldman here

33:18.197 --> 33:21.598
within the hour
of each booking.

33:24.136 --> 33:26.470
There's your proof, Peter.

33:29.975 --> 33:31.241
Is this true?

33:31.243 --> 33:33.276
These people
will say anything --

33:33.278 --> 33:34.778
was my brother calling you

33:34.780 --> 33:37.247
to defend the very people
leeching off our community?!

33:37.249 --> 33:39.783
Daniel, if you'll just
follow me outside,

33:39.785 --> 33:41.151
I can explain everything.

33:41.153 --> 33:43.520
Your steps are not
the ones I follow!

33:43.522 --> 33:45.455
Is Dennis...

33:45.457 --> 33:47.657
Are you being paid
by my brother?

33:55.134 --> 33:57.634
There's your answer,
reverend.

34:01.407 --> 34:04.608
You and I are finished, Peter,
understand?

34:04.610 --> 34:07.744
And for what you've done,
may God forgive you.

34:07.746 --> 34:09.780
What I did, Daniel,

34:09.782 --> 34:13.850
was to protect your work.

34:13.852 --> 34:15.519
I'll go.

But I urge you
to stay silent.

These people mean to
do you and your community harm.

they may well succeed.

either.

all of this is true?

35:10.175 --> 35:12.375
There's only one way,

like to know?

Maria's...

36:32.057 --> 36:34.491
About how she died,
sir.

Mr. Sanchez,
your wife passed away

36:38.997 --> 36:41.531
from concussive injuries
sustained in a car accident.

36:41.533 --> 36:43.333
During a seizure,
a seizure that happened

36:43.335 --> 36:45.769
because you took her
off her meds.

36:45.771 --> 36:47.671
Why did you do that?

36:47.673 --> 36:50.640
Why did you take Maria
off her medication?

36:50.642 --> 36:54.411
The short answer is
I didn't.

36:54.413 --> 36:56.546
In fact,
because the dose was so mild,

36:56.548 --> 36:59.182
I suggested Maria keep on it
for another year.

36:59.184 --> 37:01.518
No. No, no.
No, wait. Wait.

37:01.520 --> 37:05.822
Maria said you told her
she could go off her meds.

37:05.824 --> 37:07.724
No. I didn't.

37:07.726 --> 37:10.327
In fact,
I had Maria sign a form

37:10.329 --> 37:13.296
stating that
by discontinuing dilantin,

37:13.298 --> 37:16.733
she was acting against
the advice of a doctor

37:16.735 --> 37:21.238
and understood
the potential consequences.

37:21.240 --> 37:23.340
And I also urged Maria

37:23.342 --> 37:26.042
to discuss her decision
with her family.

37:26.044 --> 37:28.478
She never...

37:28.480 --> 37:30.647
Talked to me about this.

37:30.649 --> 37:34.718
Never would I have agreed
to this in a million years.

37:35.921 --> 37:38.121
Are you sure
it would have made a difference?

37:38.123 --> 37:39.456
From what I recall,

37:39.458 --> 37:41.858
when your wife
felt strongly about something,

37:41.860 --> 37:45.295
she did not shy away
from confrontation.

37:45.297 --> 37:47.998
No. No.

37:49.868 --> 37:51.968
She mostly got her way.

37:51.970 --> 37:57.807
She didn't ever just out-and-out
lie to me, sir.

37:57.809 --> 38:02.245
Maybe Maria found a way
to phrase her decision

than it was.

39:50.555 --> 39:52.956
without knowing
whose they were?

39:52.958 --> 39:54.758
Go ahead.
-Hmm?

39:54.760 --> 39:56.426
Ask Amy.

39:56.428 --> 39:58.294
She's not gonna
lie to your face.

39:58.296 --> 40:00.029
I know that.

40:00.932 --> 40:04.000
Provenza: Why can't I tell
what's going on?

40:04.002 --> 40:06.035
And -- and where did
the reverend copkiller go?

40:06.037 --> 40:09.539
And why did the button cam
suddenly go so dark?

40:09.541 --> 40:11.674
I think he's kneeling
by his desk.

40:11.676 --> 40:14.377
It's a good sign. Maybe praying
for strength to help us.

40:14.379 --> 40:15.678
Well, great.
Now all we need

40:15.680 --> 40:17.514
is for Dennis
to say to his brother,

40:17.516 --> 40:20.049
"I found the uzi,
murdered Emile,

40:20.051 --> 40:24.654
tamika, her son, Rachel gray,
her body guard, jfk..."

40:24.656 --> 40:25.889
And then we're done.

40:25.891 --> 40:27.857
I'd be satisfied
if Dennis confirms

40:27.859 --> 40:30.193
what Buddha told us
about drug trafficking.

40:30.195 --> 40:31.928
Well, we'll find out
soon enough.

40:31.930 --> 40:34.564
Guys,
where's Dennis price?

40:34.566 --> 40:36.866
Tao: Just arrived.

40:36.868 --> 40:38.768
Heading straight
to the sanctuary.

40:38.770 --> 40:41.471
Sykes:
Doesn't look happy.

40:41.473 --> 40:43.106
Get ready everyone.

40:43.108 --> 40:45.208
<i> We may have to move in.</i>

40:45.210 --> 40:48.511
¶¶

40:51.583 --> 40:53.283
<i> damn it, Daniel.</i>

40:53.285 --> 40:55.185
<i> What the hell do you think</i>
<i> you're doing, huh?</i>

40:55.187 --> 40:56.653
<i> Remember where you are.</i>

40:56.655 --> 40:58.955
<i> And you're the one</i>
<i> who needs to explain.</i>

40:58.957 --> 41:00.623
According
to the l.A.P.D.,

41:00.625 --> 41:03.226
you're using this church
to distribute heroin?

41:03.228 --> 41:05.395
According to the l.A.P.D.?

41:05.397 --> 41:07.096
Wow.

41:07.098 --> 41:09.399
Tell me how that uzi
showed up here?

41:09.401 --> 41:12.969
How the dogs caught the scent
of dope in an altar to Christ?

41:12.971 --> 41:16.973
Why you were putting
jon Barnes up in a motel
where they found heroin?

41:16.975 --> 41:18.341
Forget Barnes!

41:18.343 --> 41:19.909
Forget the dope,
all right?

41:19.911 --> 41:22.779
All you got to do is recite
the Bible to reporters

41:22.781 --> 41:24.981
and I'll go on cleaning up
the mess you made

41:24.983 --> 41:27.484
when you allowed cops
to search this church.

41:27.486 --> 41:29.953
I have nothing to hide.

41:29.955 --> 41:32.522
¶¶

41:32.524 --> 41:34.090
do you?
