03:04.467 --> 03:05.966
Go!

03:42.838 --> 03:45.006
Hold the line!

04:20.108 --> 04:21.173
Come here!

04:27.681 --> 04:28.983
Keda!

05:55.968 --> 05:57.369
You failed.

06:11.383 --> 06:12.551
Pass.

06:29.101 --> 06:30.102
Fail.

06:36.074 --> 06:37.109
Fail.

06:56.261 --> 06:57.296
Pass.

07:08.339 --> 07:11.375
Pain will journey with us.

07:40.404 --> 07:41.571
Stop!

08:01.725 --> 08:06.493
Stop, father, you stink!

08:08.865 --> 08:11.531
You will hunt at my side.

08:11.533 --> 08:14.270
You are the chief's son.
My son.

08:30.786 --> 08:36.058
Prove you can lead.
Find your strength.

10:06.481 --> 10:08.516
He is not ready.

10:11.985 --> 10:14.522
One season each year...

10:15.689 --> 10:18.058
...we hunt the Great Beast.

10:19.726 --> 10:22.496
We do this, or our tribe dies.

10:23.530 --> 10:27.868
He must do his part.

10:29.503 --> 10:33.373
Prove himself to the tribe.

10:36.409 --> 10:38.876
What if he can't...

10:38.878 --> 10:42.480
I love him
with my whole heart.

10:42.482 --> 10:46.717
He could die.
I am afraid.

10:46.719 --> 10:49.523
He leads with his heart.

10:50.823 --> 10:53.326
Not his spear.

11:43.642 --> 11:45.477
Take this...
so nothing will harm you.

11:46.945 --> 11:48.813
I can take care of myself.

11:55.153 --> 11:56.421
Keda.

12:06.464 --> 12:08.800
Know that I love you.

12:17.275 --> 12:19.141
He will show us
that he is a man.

12:19.143 --> 12:20.443
Earn his place to lead.

12:20.445 --> 12:22.113
Then come home to you.

12:23.181 --> 12:26.351
You can't promise that.

12:35.025 --> 12:36.293
Go.

14:16.492 --> 14:20.059
To survive we must focus...
Be patient.

14:20.061 --> 14:22.061
We must not give up.

14:57.965 --> 14:58.966
Father...

15:45.446 --> 15:46.680
My friend.

15:52.985 --> 15:56.189
You have survived the winter.
A little fatter maybe?

15:57.557 --> 15:58.725
Yes.

16:00.026 --> 16:03.831
And I bring a young hunter...

16:05.364 --> 16:08.201
Raise your head...
and your eyes will follow.

16:13.206 --> 16:14.640
This is my son.

16:20.146 --> 16:22.415
Mine will not see
another hunt.

16:24.217 --> 16:26.184
He has gone
to the ancestors.

16:45.070 --> 16:48.273
You must be a proud father.

16:49.608 --> 16:52.742
I hope he makes me proud.

17:03.088 --> 17:05.255
Our tribe has walked
the Sacred Path

17:05.257 --> 17:07.291
Path since
the first Great Hunt.

17:08.460 --> 17:12.597
Marks guide our way.
Made by our ancestors.

17:18.904 --> 17:22.069
Left as a trail
for us to follow.

17:22.071 --> 17:25.041
And to help us survive
the great journey.

17:28.580 --> 17:31.816
Our hands point us
to the hunting ground.

17:32.751 --> 17:35.486
Some will return.

17:36.053 --> 17:38.455
Some will not.

17:40.491 --> 17:44.493
Those marks remain... for the
leader to bring the hunters home.

18:11.187 --> 18:12.288
Finish it.

18:50.460 --> 18:53.228
You take a life
to give life to your tribe.

18:54.030 --> 18:56.797
Do it. Now.

19:03.372 --> 19:04.506
I'm sorry!

19:11.146 --> 19:13.116
Life is for the strong!

19:16.318 --> 19:19.254
It is earned, not given.

20:20.748 --> 20:22.416
Be calm.

20:52.345 --> 20:54.581
Stay alert.

21:32.652 --> 21:34.685
He is gone...

21:34.687 --> 21:38.622
...but we must stay strong.

21:45.131 --> 21:47.133
May his spirit
watch over the Path...

21:48.201 --> 21:51.868
...as his ancestors
before him.

24:00.596 --> 24:04.433
The stone markers
guide you during the day.

24:06.669 --> 24:12.206
Now you bear the marks...

24:12.208 --> 24:15.978
...that will guide you
at night.

24:33.028 --> 24:36.031
The light
from our ancestors...

24:38.033 --> 24:41.136
...showing us the way home.

24:47.575 --> 24:49.508
Home.

24:55.217 --> 24:57.217
You see that one?

24:57.219 --> 25:00.089
That is the Alpha,
their leader.

25:06.362 --> 25:11.165
The Alpha must care for his pack.
Above all else.

25:13.835 --> 25:17.770
But he is also
always in danger.

25:21.676 --> 25:27.413
Others in the pack
will challenge him...

25:30.918 --> 25:34.253
...if they sense weakness.

25:34.255 --> 25:37.056
The Alpha lets the others
know his place...

25:37.058 --> 25:39.593
...with his strength and calm.

25:43.131 --> 25:47.400
He was not born the Alpha.

25:47.402 --> 25:52.639
But he earned it with his courage...
and his heart.

26:13.727 --> 26:14.993
Shh.

27:32.371 --> 27:33.539
Go!

28:02.000 --> 28:03.399
Keda!

28:05.336 --> 28:06.768
Keda!

28:08.339 --> 28:10.439
Keda!

28:10.441 --> 28:12.508
Do not look down!

28:16.013 --> 28:18.216
Don't let go!

28:33.030 --> 28:36.433
Keda!

28:51.381 --> 28:53.048
My friend...

28:55.285 --> 28:57.154
...my leader...

28:59.656 --> 29:01.924
It is impossible
to reach him!

29:04.328 --> 29:06.263
He is gone.

29:09.299 --> 29:11.602
We can't lose you, too.

29:13.236 --> 29:16.072
We have a duty
to our people.

29:25.649 --> 29:27.917
Keda!

29:35.491 --> 29:37.460
Load the sleds.

29:45.800 --> 29:48.271
We must return
to our village.

29:49.804 --> 29:55.311
May the Spirits guide
and protect your people.

30:02.652 --> 30:09.625
Tell him our sons shall walk
together in the other world.

30:52.434 --> 30:55.002
You must let him go.

30:58.372 --> 31:00.274
Set him free.

31:56.963 --> 32:00.266
He is
with the Spirits now.

33:07.799 --> 33:08.900
Father!

33:11.837 --> 33:13.068
Father!

35:09.819 --> 35:10.920
Father!

36:22.890 --> 36:23.924
Father!

42:59.612 --> 43:02.148
Hyenas, we must find shelter.

46:22.010 --> 46:23.578
A friend.

46:42.997 --> 46:44.530
Maybe not.

46:54.141 --> 46:55.610
Do not bite me.

46:58.045 --> 47:00.781
I am not going to hurt you.

47:05.719 --> 47:07.788
I will keep you alive.

47:17.864 --> 47:19.033
Friend.

47:23.069 --> 47:24.204
See.

48:21.259 --> 48:23.061
It has to be cleaned.

48:56.728 --> 48:57.962
See...

49:00.665 --> 49:02.133
...not that bad.

50:08.965 --> 50:10.200
Patience.

50:46.368 --> 50:48.571
I have not forgiven you.

50:49.839 --> 50:51.741
It is up to me.

50:55.544 --> 50:57.714
You have to wait
for your turn.

51:04.686 --> 51:07.055
I am glad
we understand each other.

52:37.778 --> 52:39.814
Home.

52:51.291 --> 52:54.561
You miss them, your pack...

52:55.829 --> 52:59.466
I hear my parents
calling me in my dreams.

53:10.443 --> 53:12.912
But I can't get to them...

53:20.720 --> 53:23.188
It's getting colder.

53:25.557 --> 53:29.027
The Sacred Path will cover
with snow soon...

53:29.029 --> 53:32.431
I don't know if I can make it
home without my father.

53:36.602 --> 53:39.772
I'm not like him...

53:44.743 --> 53:47.279
...but I have to try.

53:51.517 --> 53:54.386
I miss my parents so much.

54:30.655 --> 54:32.157
That belongs to me.

54:33.424 --> 54:34.892
I need that.

55:01.986 --> 55:05.422
I have to be home
before the first snow.

55:06.224 --> 55:08.525
You should go home too.

55:11.595 --> 55:12.997
Psst.

55:13.964 --> 55:15.099
Go ahead!

55:17.701 --> 55:19.103
Stop looking at me!

55:19.536 --> 55:21.104
Go ahead!

57:10.078 --> 57:11.279
Where are you going?

57:13.648 --> 57:15.250
What do you want?

57:20.088 --> 57:21.488
Go home!

57:42.843 --> 57:44.245
Go on, get out of here!

58:48.674 --> 58:49.976
I almost had him.

58:50.676 --> 58:52.643
Did you see that?

58:56.716 --> 58:58.683
I just slipped.

59:00.652 --> 59:02.687
I'm not afraid of anything.

59:03.856 --> 59:05.992
Hey, what are you doing?

59:07.726 --> 59:08.827
Come back here!

59:12.497 --> 59:13.498
Here!

01:00:47.257 --> 01:00:48.624
Over here!

01:00:57.834 --> 01:00:58.868
Wait!

01:01:18.988 --> 01:01:19.989
No!

01:01:24.726 --> 01:01:26.195
You know I'll feed you.

01:02:59.753 --> 01:03:01.422
You stink.

01:03:17.605 --> 01:03:19.804
Get in the water!

01:03:19.806 --> 01:03:21.440
Don't make me chase you.

01:03:28.616 --> 01:03:30.281
Come here,
come here.

01:04:05.218 --> 01:04:06.484
Ah. Ah.

01:04:14.293 --> 01:04:16.194
I will call you Alpha.

01:04:17.497 --> 01:04:18.665
Keda.

01:04:20.132 --> 01:04:21.467
Alpha.

01:06:29.359 --> 01:06:32.462
Go to your family...

01:08:14.060 --> 01:08:15.262
I'm sorry...

01:09:09.348 --> 01:09:10.617
Please...

01:09:14.754 --> 01:09:16.022
Alpha!

01:11:58.981 --> 01:11:59.982
Help!

01:12:03.085 --> 01:12:04.318
Help!

01:12:04.320 --> 01:12:05.855
Friend!

01:12:20.503 --> 01:12:21.802
No...

01:12:37.619 --> 01:12:39.155
Stay.

01:12:49.798 --> 01:12:50.799
Food... Food.

01:12:58.706 --> 01:12:59.972
Nothing!

01:12:59.974 --> 01:13:01.409
No!

01:13:02.309 --> 01:13:03.375
Nothing!

01:13:24.765 --> 01:13:27.202
We will be all right.

01:14:02.602 --> 01:14:04.771
Thank you for helping us...

01:14:32.632 --> 01:14:33.731
Run!

01:16:09.394 --> 01:16:11.028
Alpha!

01:16:36.186 --> 01:16:39.589
Thank you, my friend.

01:16:41.258 --> 01:16:43.926
I will not give up on you...

01:16:44.894 --> 01:16:47.530
You are my tribe.

01:18:12.347 --> 01:18:14.382
The Path. We're close.

01:19:17.244 --> 01:19:19.580
My ancestors
are lighting the way...

01:19:20.780 --> 01:19:22.616
...guiding us home.

01:20:28.680 --> 01:20:30.282
Please. Get up.

01:20:31.950 --> 01:20:33.652
I know you can do it.

01:20:38.957 --> 01:20:41.326
We have come
so far together...

01:20:43.861 --> 01:20:46.531
I can't lose you.

01:20:50.535 --> 01:20:52.203
Please, Alpha.

01:21:38.582 --> 01:21:40.984
I just need a little rest...

01:22:14.217 --> 01:22:17.020
He could die. I am afraid.

01:22:18.121 --> 01:22:20.557
He leads with his heart.

01:22:21.691 --> 01:22:23.560
Not his spear.

01:22:26.763 --> 01:22:27.764
No.

01:22:28.698 --> 01:22:32.602
He is stronger
than you know.

01:22:35.304 --> 01:22:39.074
He is stronger
than even he knows.

01:23:34.595 --> 01:23:36.330
We're home.

01:24:19.239 --> 01:24:23.009
How can this be?

01:24:25.512 --> 01:24:26.914
Father.

01:24:34.254 --> 01:24:35.653
Keda!

01:24:43.996 --> 01:24:45.866
I was afraid
I'd never see you again.

01:24:47.267 --> 01:24:52.171
You are here. With us.
You are really home.

01:24:58.712 --> 01:25:04.348
I wanted to make you proud.

01:25:04.350 --> 01:25:10.289
You earned it, my son.
You came home to us.

01:25:26.105 --> 01:25:27.606
Alpha.

01:25:31.977 --> 01:25:33.245
Alpha needs...

01:25:33.612 --> 01:25:35.447
Help.

01:26:35.305 --> 01:26:40.375
Keda has brought you home
to us. You are family.

01:26:56.360 --> 01:27:03.333
We welcome you
into our tribe.

01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:40.269
It's okay now.
