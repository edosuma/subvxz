WEBVTT

01:02.247 --> 01:04.054
Hey. I need a cab now.

01:04.054 --> 01:05.716
Here take a number.

01:06.815 --> 01:08.311
Never mind.

01:26.462 --> 01:28.684
Dispatch said hit-and-run.

01:28.941 --> 01:31.293
Paramedics called it in at 05:30.

01:31.293 --> 01:33.702
Concierge don't recognize her
as the guest of the hotel.

01:33.702 --> 01:35.863
They eye-witnessed the incident? / Heard it.

01:35.863 --> 01:38.703
- Nobody saw a car.
- Well the car definitely saw her.

01:38.703 --> 01:40.550
Didn't it Alexx?
Pattern of injury?

01:40.550 --> 01:43.757
4000 pound vehicle against
a skinny girl like this.

01:43.757 --> 01:45.713
Multiple points of impact.

01:45.713 --> 01:48.735
- Pedestrian rotation.
- Being barefoot didn't help.

01:48.735 --> 01:50.949
No friction to hold her in place.

01:54.694 --> 01:56.315
Windshield glass.

01:58.341 --> 01:59.743
Tempered.

02:00.300 --> 02:02.813
Driver can't tell you they didn't
know what they'd hit.

02:16.623 --> 02:18.245
Horatio?

02:18.245 --> 02:20.307
Alexx, take a look at these tread marks.

02:20.307 --> 02:21.642
They go from black

02:21.642 --> 02:23.774
to light and that is caused by what?

02:23.774 --> 02:25.649
An acceleration.

02:25.737 --> 02:26.735
Hit-and-run.

02:26.735 --> 02:28.362
Suspect was speeding away.

02:28.362 --> 02:29.703
Nope.

02:31.011 --> 02:32.622
Point of rest.

02:32.622 --> 02:35.615
Point of impact right in front of that tread.

02:35.984 --> 02:38.108
You telling me the driver meant to hit her?

02:38.108 --> 02:40.583
I'm telling you that our hit-and-run

02:40.583 --> 02:42.108
is now a murder.

03:17.740 --> 03:20.483
MIAMI
2x01 Blood Brothers

03:38.993 --> 03:40.401
What have we got, Tim?

03:40.401 --> 03:42.520
Probably more than he can handle.

03:43.152 --> 03:45.966
Why don't you let a car-man deal
with the car incident there.

03:45.966 --> 03:48.782
Cause Most vehicular
incidents are about trace.

03:49.281 --> 03:51.937
Eric, Pink transmission fluid.

03:51.937 --> 03:53.653
Guy's got a leak.

03:54.128 --> 03:55.615
Tread.

03:56.103 --> 03:57.614
Tire's fingerprints?

03:57.725 --> 04:00.440
Yeah that happens when the rubber
doesn't catch up with the wheel.

04:04.012 --> 04:05.956
All four tires have the same pattern.

04:05.956 --> 04:07.672
That's gonna make
the search more difficult.

04:07.672 --> 04:10.000
Unless you need something is
the harder it is to find.

04:10.000 --> 04:11.628
Three sets of treads.

04:11.827 --> 04:13.041
The hit her

04:13.041 --> 04:14.733
backed up

04:14.733 --> 04:16.404
and hit her again.

04:16.598 --> 04:18.938
Guy wanted to make sure she was dead.

04:18.938 --> 04:21.415
Whenever somebody tries
to do a lot in a little time.

04:21.415 --> 04:23.079
Accidents happen.

04:26.880 --> 04:29.692
Heat from the collision softened up the paint.

04:34.601 --> 04:37.290
Traces just as good as the smoking gun.

04:39.481 --> 04:41.047
Are we sure nobody saw anything?

04:41.047 --> 04:44.960
Well we're certainly not gonna trust
the investigation to an eyewitness.

04:44.960 --> 04:48.051
The only thing that matters is the evidence.

04:48.250 --> 04:49.518
Let's be thorough.

04:49.705 --> 04:50.819
You got it.

04:57.082 --> 04:58.773
How are we doing?

04:58.773 --> 05:00.088
No ID.

05:00.088 --> 05:02.287
But a handful of Benjamin's in her pockets.

05:02.743 --> 05:04.153
You think she's a pro?

05:04.153 --> 05:07.885
I was thinking maybe a SoBe call girl
but everything about her says model.

05:07.885 --> 05:11.578
Implants, collagen, rib removal, weight.
Or lack of it.

05:11.578 --> 05:13.559
Barely out of your teens.

05:13.559 --> 05:15.230
You don't belong here yet.

05:15.230 --> 05:17.314
Let's notify Interpol.

05:18.825 --> 05:22.303
Most of these models are far nationals.
Take a look at that.

05:24.317 --> 05:26.153
Looks like glass.

05:31.249 --> 05:34.465
- Doesn't look like windshield glass.
- No, it's not tempered. It's blue.

05:34.465 --> 05:36.544
Maybe it's from some type of bottle.

05:37.827 --> 05:40.287
Azuret champagne comes to mind.

05:42.270 --> 05:44.724
So she fought with this guy
before he ran her over.

05:44.724 --> 05:46.559
Boy is he a prize.

05:46.753 --> 05:48.603
All right I'll tell you what.
Let's send the money to the lab,

05:48.603 --> 05:50.623
and see if we can get
some fingerprints off it. All right?

05:50.623 --> 05:51.716
I'll find you.

05:55.282 --> 05:57.476
Victim crosses the street
heading southbound.

05:57.476 --> 05:59.727
Initial impact was here.

06:00.287 --> 06:03.467
Based on autopsy protocol,
fibula was shattered here.

06:03.916 --> 06:07.208
Tells us suspect scribes
at aero-dynamic front.

06:07.812 --> 06:09.024
Super low.

06:09.238 --> 06:11.236
Center's super high.

06:11.362 --> 06:13.598
Then according to autopsy protocol,

06:13.598 --> 06:15.592
after hitting the windshield,

06:16.048 --> 06:18.606
she cleared the car and
landed on the pavement.

06:18.606 --> 06:20.199
I'm thinking like this.

06:22.450 --> 06:25.399
Okay. Let's take it back
to the front bumper.

06:25.535 --> 06:28.587
Anything that aero-dynamic
has to be high end.

06:28.587 --> 06:31.687
Give me the stats,
relative to the victim's legs.

06:34.019 --> 06:36.535
Database for grill dimensions
at your service.

06:41.653 --> 06:43.280
4.5

06:43.752 --> 06:44.989
you know what? Don't even bother.

06:44.989 --> 06:47.176
There's only one car with a grill that low.

06:47.267 --> 06:48.569
Good work, Ty, thanks.

06:55.113 --> 06:56.395
It's Lamborghini.

06:56.395 --> 06:57.524
Diablo.

06:57.966 --> 07:01.358
PPG code: 0056.

07:03.726 --> 07:05.475
Pearl Metallic yellow.

07:05.702 --> 07:06.608
That's it.

07:06.608 --> 07:09.471
How many guys in Miami,
you think own that car?

07:09.471 --> 07:10.783
You think own or rent?

07:10.783 --> 07:14.254
The car cost a quarter million dollar.
So we're talking some serious cheddar.

07:14.254 --> 07:16.130
Well that narrows the field.

07:16.408 --> 07:19.373
You still know that girl at the BMV
because I hate being put on hold.

07:19.520 --> 07:20.622
Yeah. Gena.

07:20.622 --> 07:21.610
Why?

07:22.140 --> 07:25.695
Here. / I'm not calling her.
She's, come on man.

07:25.695 --> 07:28.813
Cause then I'm gonna have to hear
about how she never hears from me.

07:28.813 --> 07:30.591
I don't want to deal with that.

07:30.591 --> 07:33.011
Eric. You gotta take them
out to eat once in a while.

07:33.011 --> 07:34.583
You gotta cultivate things.

07:34.583 --> 07:36.753
You're better than that.
I'm gonna dial it for you.

07:41.455 --> 07:43.151
Did we get anything off
those 100-dollar bills?

07:43.151 --> 07:46.629
No definite ridges but the bills are
out of the federal reserve in Atlanta

07:46.629 --> 07:49.081
but I'm still working on
a Miami branch for dispersal.

07:49.081 --> 07:51.609
Okay. / I got a make on that
vehicle that hit our victim.

07:51.609 --> 07:53.847
Registered to a Mr. Scott Mandeville.

07:53.847 --> 07:56.475
Of Mandeville modeling agency.
That guy's Mr. Salvage.

07:56.475 --> 07:59.652
Yes. Run out of New York last year.
What's his current address, Speed?

07:59.652 --> 08:01.963
They got him staying at the Nationalle.

08:02.937 --> 08:04.286
That's where the girl was killed.

08:14.252 --> 08:15.307
Hey girls.

08:15.307 --> 08:16.470
The music.

08:16.626 --> 08:17.676
Chill.

08:24.741 --> 08:25.996
You're a cop.

08:28.333 --> 08:30.034
I'm a CSI.

08:32.446 --> 08:33.873
Do you know this girl?

08:36.513 --> 08:37.967
It's Tess Kimball.

08:39.462 --> 08:41.568
Been repping(representing) her
for about 18 months.

08:42.455 --> 08:45.094
Found her at go-see for
a Vogue layout.

08:45.094 --> 08:47.296
She's from Houston.
or places.

08:47.815 --> 08:49.364
There's the accent.

08:49.364 --> 08:50.538
How'd that happen?

08:50.538 --> 08:52.605
Actually I was hoping you could tell me.

08:52.605 --> 08:53.779
Me?

08:53.984 --> 08:54.975
How would I know?

08:54.975 --> 08:57.142
Paint from you car

08:57.142 --> 08:59.179
has been burned into her fibula.

08:59.179 --> 09:04.255
Metallic yellow Lamborghini
registered to you.

09:06.766 --> 09:08.338
Hey Scottie.

09:08.338 --> 09:09.745
We wanna go eat.

09:09.745 --> 09:11.198
Then go.

09:11.616 --> 09:12.873
Go.

09:18.336 --> 09:21.411
I had a party up here
last night for the industry.

09:21.583 --> 09:23.424
Designers, editors,

09:23.424 --> 09:27.472
any model who wasn't working
in the show including Tess.

09:28.846 --> 09:30.359
My car is a perk.

09:30.359 --> 09:32.785
Anybody who wants to take a drive can.

09:32.785 --> 09:34.704
You got a guest list for the party?

09:35.662 --> 09:38.523
Listen. Those people are
my agency's life blood.

09:38.523 --> 09:42.216
You start calling them about a dead
model and I am out of business. / Scott.

09:42.378 --> 09:45.688
There are many ways for you
to go out of business.

09:47.648 --> 09:49.065
Fine.

09:49.218 --> 09:51.081
You want my list?

09:51.320 --> 09:53.480
Get a warrant. / We don't really
need it Mr. Mandeville.

09:53.480 --> 09:56.547
As it turns out, your party was
on MTV last night.

09:56.547 --> 09:58.582
Yeah. / Yeah. I'm a night

09:58.582 --> 10:02.007
I watched it with some popcorn
and a cup of decaffeinated tea.

10:02.007 --> 10:03.806
Alright. Let's get a dup
of the tape to the lab.

10:03.806 --> 10:05.210
How did the inside look?

10:05.210 --> 10:08.249
Well I think it turns out they maid
missed a few spots in the guest room.

10:08.249 --> 10:09.363
Good.

10:11.062 --> 10:12.709
You mind if I looked inside?

10:18.264 --> 10:21.021
Hey, any blood you find
in there is not mine.

10:26.773 --> 10:28.209
Who was in here last night?

10:28.521 --> 10:30.483
I told you. I had a party.

10:33.108 --> 10:34.853
Yes you did.

10:36.902 --> 10:39.191
And you had a thousand people.

10:46.082 --> 10:48.157
A thousand people.

10:49.749 --> 10:51.661
But you see, Scott.

10:51.818 --> 10:56.210
The problem is this blood is
gonna lead me to just one.

10:56.210 --> 10:59.302
And if it's you, or you're
covering for someone,

10:59.302 --> 11:02.053
your agency closing is gonna be
the least of your problems.

11:02.053 --> 11:03.590
Where's your car?

11:04.161 --> 11:06.303
I think I want my lawyer.

11:07.069 --> 11:08.661
I bet you do.

11:15.458 --> 11:18.365
Tyler what's up? Did you calculate the
speed of the vehicle yet?

11:18.365 --> 11:21.146
Coefficient says at least
20 miles per hour.

11:21.786 --> 11:24.930
I hope you're right.
Air bags deploy at 17.

11:27.156 --> 11:30.602
Inflating 40 times faster
than the blink of an eye.

11:31.360 --> 11:33.863
Which gas gets under 300 degrees.

11:33.863 --> 11:38.158
Which means our guy would have air bag
burns on his face or his arms.

11:38.312 --> 11:39.673
I'll let H know.

11:44.192 --> 11:45.678
I'll be with you in just a second.

12:00.118 --> 12:01.901
Horatio.

12:02.062 --> 12:03.005
How you doing?

12:03.005 --> 12:05.612
Why don't you tell me Rick?
You're with IAB.

12:05.675 --> 12:09.596
No investigation here..
just solidifying relationships.

12:09.596 --> 12:12.739
- Make lateral move within the bureau.
- It's funny because in my understanding,

12:12.739 --> 12:15.129
you can only move up in internal affairs.

12:15.129 --> 12:17.057
Liaison to the mayor's office.

12:17.057 --> 12:18.770
That's big stuff. Congratulations.

12:18.770 --> 12:20.871
The city does feel safer.

12:23.955 --> 12:27.370
You think your sister-in-law's ready?

12:32.725 --> 12:34.413
Excuse me?

12:34.832 --> 12:38.958
To see someone. I mean it's been
a couple of years since your brother passed.

12:40.457 --> 12:42.551
Why don't you take it up with her?

12:44.032 --> 12:45.301
You're right.

12:45.638 --> 12:46.937
That's good advice.

12:47.877 --> 12:48.868
Hi

12:48.868 --> 12:49.944
Hi.

12:51.519 --> 12:53.304
Missed you at Mandeville's.

12:55.058 --> 12:56.321
You didn't get my message?

12:56.321 --> 13:00.319
No I did. That you located the victim's hotel
room and that you were interviewing people.

13:00.319 --> 13:04.289
Turns out that Tess had a roommate
at the hotel. Michelle Cormier.

13:04.289 --> 13:06.280
Who nobody's seen in two days.

13:06.280 --> 13:08.430
Here. Her headshots.

13:08.430 --> 13:10.126
Okay any chance she went back to Idaho?

13:10.126 --> 13:11.449
Quebec.

13:11.449 --> 13:13.933
But I found out what agency repped her.

13:13.933 --> 13:18.124
Let me guess. And there it is.
The Scott Mandeville Agency.

13:18.816 --> 13:20.763
He's taking on attorney.

13:20.995 --> 13:23.361
Got a lead on a girl who works
with Tess and Michelle.

13:23.361 --> 13:25.710
Going to meet her after
her show at the Shore Club.

13:25.710 --> 13:27.680
I'll page you as soon as I know anything.

13:32.496 --> 13:34.416
Yelina. / Yes?

13:34.675 --> 13:35.942
Page me.

13:39.710 --> 13:43.949
Agency owner Scott Mandeville's throwing
a intimate party for 500 of his closest industry friends.

13:43.949 --> 13:45.421
So, brother, how you doing?

13:46.122 --> 13:47.130
I'm great man.

13:47.130 --> 13:49.037
Much great that I'm here at your party.

13:49.489 --> 13:51.450
I want to have this guy's job.

13:52.031 --> 13:54.415
Travel. Homemade parties.

13:56.805 --> 13:57.827
Yeah.

13:57.827 --> 13:59.417
But we get to pack heat.

13:59.864 --> 14:02.936
- Yes. It's hotty gloom in the flesh,
- Hi. /-how're doing love?

14:02.936 --> 14:04.152
- Good how are you?
- I'm doing great.

14:04.152 --> 14:06.741
So what are doing for Miami fashion
tonight guess Michelle's lined up.

14:06.741 --> 14:08.866
Well, actually I'm doing
a movie in the Evergrates.

14:08.866 --> 14:10.281
That's kind of flower.
What are you doing?

14:10.281 --> 14:13.483
I'm wrestling alligators.
It's scary!

14:13.654 --> 14:14.747
Lucky alligators..

14:18.556 --> 14:20.288
What is that?

14:23.701 --> 14:25.276
In the back. That's Tess.

14:25.276 --> 14:26.452
Can you zoom in?

14:27.211 --> 14:28.607
Zooming.

14:31.048 --> 14:33.326
Yeah. That's Tess.

14:33.801 --> 14:35.275
So who's that guy?

14:36.058 --> 14:38.004
Clavo Cruz.

14:38.193 --> 14:39.214
The player?

14:39.214 --> 14:40.913
From South America?

14:41.607 --> 14:43.614
He looks pretty agitated.

14:46.720 --> 14:49.045
That guy.
He's always at premiers.

14:49.045 --> 14:50.806
Big events.

14:51.769 --> 14:54.350
This might have been one event
he should have missed.

15:02.253 --> 15:04.741
Tell me more about Clavo Scott.

15:04.989 --> 15:10.097
My client gifted his car to Clavo Cruz
two nights ago before the incident.

15:10.097 --> 15:13.247
Just so we're clear. We're talking about
the Cruz brothers from Berakas, right?

15:13.247 --> 15:15.687
Clavo owns a portion of my agency.

15:15.687 --> 15:18.045
And you gifted him your car. / Yeah.

15:18.045 --> 15:19.811
Don't you mean he took it?

15:20.434 --> 15:22.421
Look, like I said.

15:22.596 --> 15:24.573
He's an investor in my company.

15:24.573 --> 15:27.888
Don't you think that you should
have called the PD first.

15:29.168 --> 15:30.485
Do you know Clavo?

15:30.485 --> 15:32.075
Not personally.

15:34.763 --> 15:37.203
He's a scary guy.

15:37.485 --> 15:38.735
Where's he now?

15:38.735 --> 15:41.631
He's probably where all the girls
go between shows.

15:41.772 --> 15:42.957
Pearl.

15:56.067 --> 15:57.597
The one in the jewelry.

15:57.791 --> 15:59.189
That's Clavo Cruz.

16:00.488 --> 16:01.979
Shocking.

16:07.387 --> 16:09.552
Lieutenant Caine. Miami PD.

16:09.763 --> 16:11.608
That's a pretty girl Lieutenant.

16:11.608 --> 16:13.841
Reminds me of the girls in Berakas.

16:13.841 --> 16:15.716
Only thing that makes me miss home.

16:15.851 --> 16:17.515
Take a look at this pretty girl.

16:19.517 --> 16:21.551
We have reason to
believe you killed her.

16:22.361 --> 16:23.818
No way.

16:24.038 --> 16:25.373
I could never hurt a woman.

16:25.373 --> 16:26.468
Hit-and-run?

16:26.468 --> 16:28.706
Outside the hotel in Collins. / No.

16:28.965 --> 16:30.741
How'd you get that burn on your face?

16:31.611 --> 16:33.082
That's a razor burn.

16:33.082 --> 16:34.564
I get too many ingrown.

16:34.564 --> 16:36.291
Wrong. It's from an air bag.

16:36.291 --> 16:38.111
You were behind the wheel
when you hit her.

16:38.111 --> 16:39.548
You know.

16:39.548 --> 16:41.664
I'm pretty sure that was a dog, dog.

16:41.664 --> 16:42.959
Stand up.

16:45.272 --> 16:46.997
Turn around.
We're taking you in.

16:47.282 --> 16:49.044
You can't arrest me.

16:49.737 --> 16:51.485
I got immunity.

16:51.485 --> 16:53.787
Diplomatic immunity.

16:54.013 --> 16:56.172
Bolivia, Brazil, Chile.

16:56.172 --> 16:58.212
The blue book says nothing about Berakas.

16:58.212 --> 16:59.570
No. no.

16:59.716 --> 17:01.619
the state department comped us in.

17:01.619 --> 17:03.218
during Iraq.

17:03.218 --> 17:04.612
You got no game.

17:04.612 --> 17:05.694
It's true Lieutenant.

17:05.694 --> 17:11.498
State department gave expedited accreditation
to our father as Berakas' general for life.

17:11.498 --> 17:14.625
- Which as you know
- Extends to his sons.

17:15.107 --> 17:17.065
Okay. In exchange for what?

17:17.223 --> 17:19.038
That's something you'd have to ask state.

17:19.038 --> 17:21.105
I told you I was untouchable.

17:21.804 --> 17:23.604
But I gotta tell you.

17:23.604 --> 17:26.335
When I saw that girl fly
through the air like that?

17:26.765 --> 17:28.891
That was sick my bro.

17:28.891 --> 17:31.058
It made me wish I had a video.

17:32.054 --> 17:33.486
Get him out of here.

17:33.650 --> 17:35.101
Let's go. / Don't touch me.

17:35.935 --> 17:37.171
Over here.

17:37.488 --> 17:38.874
I want to talk to you.

17:39.337 --> 17:42.140
Lieutenant, I understand it's upsetting.

17:42.293 --> 17:45.361
Let me say, on behalf of my family,

17:45.361 --> 17:47.423
I am sorry about this girl.

17:47.554 --> 17:48.919
You own businesses here.

17:48.919 --> 17:50.757
You enjoy the freedom of this country.

17:50.757 --> 17:54.295
For as your brother, is an all American
playboy until he gets in to trouble.

17:54.295 --> 17:56.526
And then he is suddenly a Berakan Prince.

17:56.526 --> 17:58.679
You tell your family,

17:58.679 --> 18:03.296
on behalf of that girl laying in the morgue,
apology not accepted.

18:05.741 --> 18:07.556
So Pete NG-ed the guy.

18:08.183 --> 18:11.423
We can't make Clavo person a non grato.

18:11.423 --> 18:14.263
We sent him home.
His own man retaliates.

18:14.263 --> 18:16.789
Starts framing our diplomats in Berakas.

18:16.789 --> 18:19.373
What is going on in Iraq?

18:20.251 --> 18:22.292
- Clavo's got a big mouth.
- Come on. Jim.

18:22.292 --> 18:23.927
Come on. / I'm State.

18:23.927 --> 18:26.973
That's Langley. / You know Jim,
I don't care if it's the post office.

18:26.973 --> 18:30.370
I want to know why a murderer
gets to go free in Miami.

18:31.757 --> 18:35.163
Hey. / Hey. Hi Rick.
I thought that was you.

18:35.163 --> 18:37.532
- How are you?
- I'm good, good. And you?

18:37.987 --> 18:39.415
All right. You want the rumor?

18:39.415 --> 18:40.962
Go for it.

18:41.307 --> 18:43.747
When we went into Baghdad,

18:43.951 --> 18:45.874
we captured entire cells.

18:45.874 --> 18:48.221
Some of the savviest terrorists in the world.

18:48.221 --> 18:52.753
But we can't get their intelligence
without coercion.

18:54.043 --> 18:55.344
You mean torture?

18:55.344 --> 18:58.028
United States of America does not
torture prisoners of war.

18:58.028 --> 18:59.769
But Berakas does..

18:59.769 --> 19:01.348
for us.

19:01.668 --> 19:03.941
If you believe the rumors.

19:04.227 --> 19:07.107
And we stay one step
ahead of the next 9.11.

19:07.973 --> 19:09.152
so you see,

19:09.152 --> 19:10.571
why we can't touch Clavo.

19:10.784 --> 19:11.888
I do.

19:18.154 --> 19:19.505
To be continued.

19:30.947 --> 19:33.831
I take it the State Department
is not going to expel Clavo.

19:34.536 --> 19:36.282
National security.

19:36.441 --> 19:37.327
Now what?

19:37.327 --> 19:38.845
We drop the case? / No.

19:38.845 --> 19:40.331
Things change.

19:40.331 --> 19:43.384
Allies become enemies,
suddenly evidence,

19:43.576 --> 19:45.572
evidence becomes a factor.

19:45.784 --> 19:47.203
Okay.

19:48.642 --> 19:50.640
I see Stedman over there.

19:51.003 --> 19:54.450
Yes. He said you told him to talk to me.

19:54.450 --> 19:58.205
No. that's not what I said to him.
I said to him I couldn't speak for you.

19:58.353 --> 20:00.216
Not for yourself apparently.

20:04.801 --> 20:05.987
Okay.

20:06.534 --> 20:08.250
I used to think

20:08.250 --> 20:11.808
that you hadn't met Raymond first,
that you and I.

20:12.167 --> 20:13.446
Then Raymond died. / Right.

20:13.446 --> 20:14.837
And everything changed.

20:14.837 --> 20:18.063
And it is easy to get used
to those boundaries.

20:20.694 --> 20:22.597
Right.

20:22.690 --> 20:24.975
I'm still your brother's wife.

20:26.708 --> 20:28.391
It's not your fault Raymond got killed.

20:28.391 --> 20:29.769
Not mine.

20:29.769 --> 20:33.893
If anything you tried harder than anyone
to get Raymond to be more careful.

20:34.918 --> 20:36.687
And maybe I didn't try hard enough.

20:36.687 --> 20:38.476
That is not true.

20:39.223 --> 20:40.831
I don't believe that.

20:43.601 --> 20:45.558
But maybe you do.

20:50.501 --> 20:51.820
Okay.

20:54.506 --> 20:56.795
I suppose I'm

20:56.795 --> 20:59.928
going to have to accept things for now.

21:03.754 --> 21:05.588
But I'm not going out with Stedlar.

21:06.585 --> 21:07.871
He stares.

21:10.554 --> 21:12.197
You did notice that.

21:12.661 --> 21:15.415
By the way, he's doing it again right now.

21:15.573 --> 21:16.850
I'll talk to you later.

21:20.272 --> 21:21.741
Thank you. / Good night.

21:28.680 --> 21:31.261
Look. They've been in there
since this afternoon.

21:31.261 --> 21:32.975
Maybe he's gone out the back.

21:33.479 --> 21:36.857
Clavo Cruz's definitely
coming out the front door.

21:36.857 --> 21:38.130
How do you figure?

21:38.130 --> 21:40.932
He loves attention too much
to slip out the back.

21:40.932 --> 21:43.346
Haven't you ever seen him in
Ocean Drive magazine?

21:43.346 --> 21:44.687
He's everywhere.

21:44.687 --> 21:46.015
He's cam round.

21:47.504 --> 21:49.117
Wait a minute. That's him.

21:53.628 --> 21:55.657
Hey he looks WWI too.

21:55.657 --> 21:57.956
Definitely walking while intoxicated.

21:58.301 --> 22:01.197
When he gets behind the wheel of that car,
he's our business right?

22:05.849 --> 22:07.927
I can stand on one foot okay?

22:07.927 --> 22:09.234
Look. Watch me.

22:09.234 --> 22:11.851
You couldn't do it at your vehicle
and that's what counts.

22:11.851 --> 22:14.592
You are officially detained.
I want your keys.

22:16.738 --> 22:19.261
When are you gonna get it, SA?

22:19.261 --> 22:21.986
The Vienna Convention
makes me untouchable.

22:21.986 --> 22:23.042
Not tonight.

22:23.042 --> 22:28.058
The Diplomatic Relations Act of 1978
stipulates that the diplomat can be detained

22:28.058 --> 22:31.287
by police if he presents eminent danger
to the host nation's citizen

22:31.287 --> 22:35.258
such as driving under
the influence of alcohol.

22:35.258 --> 22:37.495
And you my friend,
couldn't even walk a straight line.

22:37.495 --> 22:40.111
So you'll be taken home by the radio car

22:40.111 --> 22:44.413
and you can pick up your vehicle up
in the morning at the impound lot.

22:44.864 --> 22:46.584
You know what's crazy?

22:49.440 --> 22:52.809
I can kill someone in your country

22:52.809 --> 22:54.351
but I can't drive drunk.

22:54.399 --> 22:55.712
I just want your keys.

23:03.107 --> 23:04.516
Pick 'em up.

23:04.798 --> 23:06.305
You want 'em?

23:06.549 --> 23:07.807
You pick 'em up.

23:19.990 --> 23:21.314
Thank you.

23:22.361 --> 23:24.336
- Come on let's go.
- Get your hands off me.

23:31.242 --> 23:33.346
Sure is nice when they help, huh?

23:43.927 --> 23:45.121
There she is.

23:45.226 --> 23:47.122
This car costs more than my condo.

23:47.963 --> 23:50.645
Okay. Let's see if Clavo left us anything.

23:52.360 --> 23:55.451
Gonna be sealant
the windshield's been replaced.

23:56.031 --> 23:57.867
The airbag has been too

23:57.867 --> 23:58.682
Really?

23:58.682 --> 24:01.740
Do you think we might be able to locate
it at a repair shop or something?

24:02.363 --> 24:03.868
Got some ideas.

24:06.933 --> 24:08.231
I got some fabric here.

24:08.231 --> 24:10.057
It's the same color as our victim's dress.

24:11.135 --> 24:12.383
Is it loose?

24:12.383 --> 24:14.068
Cause we can't touch anything legally.

24:14.068 --> 24:15.266
I know but it could be.

24:25.490 --> 24:26.732
There it is.

24:28.682 --> 24:30.461
It's public property now.

24:30.858 --> 24:32.912
And it's got some blood on it.

24:34.919 --> 24:38.095
Well this is our murder car,
as if we had any doubts.

24:38.763 --> 24:40.312
Let's go find that airbag.

24:41.490 --> 24:43.237
You think they could hold me.

24:43.237 --> 24:44.117
What's up, Fossy.

24:45.681 --> 24:48.811
Party's starting right now.
I'm flower baby.

24:49.058 --> 24:51.847
You can't stop me,
you can only hope to contain me.

24:51.847 --> 24:52.787
You know what I'm saying?

24:58.081 --> 25:00.245
Thank you for bringing
my little brother home.

25:02.163 --> 25:03.743
You know why he killed Tess.

25:03.743 --> 25:05.401
Don't you?

25:06.477 --> 25:07.760
My brother's unstable.

25:07.760 --> 25:09.274
- Everyone knows that.
- Yeah that right.

25:09.274 --> 25:10.949
You're the same one.

25:10.949 --> 25:13.807
You would have never let him
go clubbing 48 hours after a murder.

25:13.807 --> 25:17.386
You would have insisted
that he keep a low profile.

25:17.587 --> 25:19.553
So what does he have on you?

25:19.653 --> 25:21.506
Let it go Lieutenant.

25:21.755 --> 25:24.512
We're protected by
your own federal government.

25:26.939 --> 25:28.753
Things change Ramon.

25:38.573 --> 25:39.967
Horatio.

25:40.066 --> 25:41.717
Where?

25:44.047 --> 25:45.141
Find her on the beach?

25:45.141 --> 25:47.070
Tess's roommate. / Michelle Cormier?

25:47.070 --> 25:49.824
Neck bruising.
She was involved in a struggle.

25:49.919 --> 25:51.881
But I don't see any defense wounds.

25:51.881 --> 25:53.751
She was taken by surprise.

25:53.751 --> 25:56.664
Can't tell how long she was in the water
but I'll know better after post.

25:56.664 --> 25:58.731
All right. Let's start with
the sexual assault kit. Okay?

25:58.731 --> 25:59.869
Will do.

26:00.443 --> 26:01.745
Detective.

26:02.425 --> 26:04.817
When was the last time
Michelle Cormier was seen alive?

26:04.817 --> 26:07.685
A model says she was Council
topping first night of fashion week.

26:07.685 --> 26:09.921
And so far, that's the last time
anyone saw Michelle.

26:09.921 --> 26:11.678
Let's find out which council it is.

26:11.678 --> 26:13.369
I know.
We'll start with Berakas.

26:13.369 --> 26:14.862
You do realize they won't see me.

26:14.862 --> 26:17.082
Well maybe Clavo will answer the door.

26:17.201 --> 26:18.322
For you.

26:18.322 --> 26:21.533
I just got off the phone with
the Lamborghini dealership in Coral Gables.

26:21.533 --> 26:24.646
They replaced an airbag
on a metallic yellow two days ago.

26:24.646 --> 26:26.202
All right. Let's go pick it up.

26:26.263 --> 26:27.952
Trash beat us to it.

26:28.204 --> 26:29.943
So we go to the landfill.

26:29.943 --> 26:34.042
An upscale place like Coral Gables
does not have a landfill. / Right.

26:34.042 --> 26:37.336
They ship it out of the country
on a barge to Haiti.

26:37.336 --> 26:39.229
You know what that means.

27:02.986 --> 27:04.155
Hey

27:04.305 --> 27:05.516
check this out.

27:10.272 --> 27:13.944
How did that get from your apartment
to there is what I want to know.

27:14.049 --> 27:15.649
That's very funny.

27:35.830 --> 27:37.100
You got the right one?

27:37.100 --> 27:38.944
Yeah. / There's your airbag.

28:14.326 --> 28:16.309
Good afternoon. / Hello.

28:18.264 --> 28:20.011
So, what do we have here?

28:20.011 --> 28:21.799
Epithelial from the airbag.

28:21.799 --> 28:26.019
Would you mind checking it to see if it
matches the saliva from our spitting champ?

28:29.290 --> 28:30.315
I'll page you.

28:30.482 --> 28:31.534
I'll wait.

28:33.082 --> 28:34.173
I'm very hands-on.

28:34.173 --> 28:37.341
They may be mentioned that to you
when you transferred here.

29:11.470 --> 29:12.769
Match confirmed.

29:12.911 --> 29:15.896
So Clavo was behind
the wheel when the airbag deployed.

29:22.165 --> 29:24.503
Runs it proof. Clavo did it.

29:25.197 --> 29:27.421
She's looking over
your shoulder, isn't she?

29:27.421 --> 29:28.937
Occupational hazard.

29:28.937 --> 29:33.024
I am a dedicated civil servant,
Alexx, just like you.

29:33.024 --> 29:36.969
I see that you're walking your
own samples to the lab to be tested.

29:36.969 --> 29:39.080
Is that the Cormier girl,
the one from the beach?

29:39.080 --> 29:40.139
The one and the same.

29:40.139 --> 29:42.640
You want me to compare
and contrast with Clavo's spit?

29:43.184 --> 29:44.005
Thank you.

29:44.005 --> 29:45.362
Sure. I'll page you.

29:45.362 --> 29:46.356
I'll wait.

29:47.277 --> 29:48.698
I can't help it.

29:48.698 --> 29:50.751
It's in my DNA.
I'm just naturally curious.

29:54.454 --> 29:57.067
Results from Michelle Cormier's
sexual assault kit,

29:57.067 --> 29:58.770
I compared it with Clavo's DNA.

29:58.770 --> 30:00.074
They're not a match, are they?

30:00.074 --> 30:03.170
No. but there are enough common
wheels to suggest it's from a male relative.

30:03.170 --> 30:04.605
You mean like a brother?

30:08.132 --> 30:10.542
Parents are flying in from Quebec City.

30:10.542 --> 30:14.269
Her mother, as it turns out,
has never been on a airplane before.

30:14.967 --> 30:19.139
Cause of death was drowning
with concurrent strangulation.

30:19.308 --> 30:22.424
So Ramon has been a busy boy.
Was the sex consensual?

30:23.920 --> 30:25.882
No physical findings.

30:26.347 --> 30:28.883
The thing is, the water
in her lungs weren't salt water.

30:28.883 --> 30:30.319
I smell chlorine.

30:30.319 --> 30:33.154
I sent a sample to Trace for the particulars.

30:33.154 --> 30:34.592
Horatio.

30:40.050 --> 30:41.297
Excuse me.

30:43.425 --> 30:45.641
My superior sent me.

30:45.641 --> 30:48.147
Next time it's gonna be DOJ.

30:48.147 --> 30:50.889
Leave the Cruz brothers alone.

30:51.046 --> 30:52.706
Let me just get it clear
who we're talking about.

30:52.706 --> 30:56.909
Are we talking about the Cruz brother
who killed the girl on the table down there,

30:57.073 --> 30:59.171
or the Cruz brother that
killed her roommate?

30:59.171 --> 31:00.709
Which is it?

31:00.914 --> 31:02.894
Langley got a call from General for life.

31:02.894 --> 31:06.270
Complains a CSI is harassing
his sons here in Miami.

31:06.395 --> 31:07.417
Impounded a car?

31:07.417 --> 31:08.695
His sons are killers.

31:08.695 --> 31:11.114
The general says it stops now.

31:11.114 --> 31:15.135
Or what? He's gonna close the interview
camps we have no knowledge about Jim?

31:15.290 --> 31:18.204
He also want you to apologize to his sons.

31:19.630 --> 31:21.367
You are a kidder, Jim.

31:21.367 --> 31:22.665
No jokes on this pay scale.

31:22.665 --> 31:24.116
Here's what's gonna happen.

31:24.116 --> 31:26.216
You're gonna apologize for me.

31:26.443 --> 31:27.931
How would that be?

31:28.282 --> 31:29.606
Alexx,

31:29.719 --> 31:33.712
can I have the water sample from Trace
from our victim's lungs please, ASAP?

31:33.712 --> 31:36.738
You got it. / No, Caine.
you apologize.

31:36.738 --> 31:37.767
In person.

31:37.767 --> 31:41.113
A federal funds from
Miami CSI will be pulled immediately.

31:41.113 --> 31:43.009
Want your lab limping along?

31:43.009 --> 31:45.296
Having to fire your staff one by one?

31:45.296 --> 31:46.386
That's funny.

31:46.386 --> 31:48.087
You talking about loyalty.

31:49.751 --> 31:52.218
Tomorrow. 10 am.

32:02.883 --> 32:04.829
So Mr. Cruz.

32:04.829 --> 32:06.876
Lieutenant Caine
has something he'd like to say to you.

32:14.721 --> 32:16.794
You're making us late.

32:17.666 --> 32:21.446
We're going deep-sea fishing
as a Marlin or waiting.

32:25.011 --> 32:26.514
Lieutenant.

32:27.103 --> 32:30.296
If this is another insult to my father and us.

32:30.296 --> 32:32.321
Lieutenant Caine.

32:38.350 --> 32:41.233
I would like to apologize to you gentlemen

32:41.233 --> 32:45.804
for any inconvenience I caused you.

32:47.148 --> 32:49.509
And if you would extend

32:49.509 --> 32:51.388
my sentiment to your father

32:51.388 --> 32:54.487
and his government,
I would appreciate it.

32:57.071 --> 32:59.348
Apology accepted.

32:59.712 --> 33:01.308
Okay man.

33:01.542 --> 33:04.098
Just out of curiosity,

33:06.309 --> 33:10.517
is that the swimming pool that
you drowned Michelle in?

33:11.370 --> 33:12.201
Caine.

33:12.201 --> 33:14.648
- Intellectual exercise.
- You're out of here Caine.

33:14.648 --> 33:15.803
It's okay.

33:16.355 --> 33:17.779
It is.

33:18.053 --> 33:21.884
Lieutenant Caine's single
mindedness is engaging.

33:25.342 --> 33:26.709
Not that pool.

33:26.709 --> 33:27.881
No.

33:38.160 --> 33:39.852
And if it matters,

33:41.586 --> 33:43.514
it was an accident.

33:47.357 --> 33:49.700
Well it does matter.

33:50.022 --> 33:52.448
I guess while you were busy
taking what you wanted,

33:52.448 --> 33:54.350
you forgot she was down there.

33:58.901 --> 34:02.103
When you have everything,
sometimes it feels like nothing.

34:05.157 --> 34:11.422
So when Tess Kimble came over the
next night to look for her girlfriend,

34:11.724 --> 34:14.128
I guess I'm wondering,

34:14.393 --> 34:16.530
how did he mow her down?

34:20.342 --> 34:22.576
You've just become less engaging.

34:45.025 --> 34:47.527
the blue bottles from Tess' hand..

34:48.779 --> 34:50.426
Guess what?

34:51.199 --> 34:53.489
That glass has Ramon's blood on it.

34:53.887 --> 34:55.746
Just came from DNA.

34:56.297 --> 34:59.229
He thought he could sweet talk her
into forgetting about her friend.

34:59.490 --> 35:01.334
A little Champagne, a lot of cash.

35:01.334 --> 35:03.958
- Did you kill Michelle?
- Was a terrible accident.

35:04.195 --> 35:05.296
You killed her. / No.

35:06.406 --> 35:07.946
No. Listen. Listen to me.

35:08.194 --> 35:10.834
- We can fix this.
- That confirms her suspicions.

35:11.856 --> 35:13.313
He gets agitated.
He tries to seduce her.

35:13.313 --> 35:15.181
- It was an accident.
- She fights back.

35:17.213 --> 35:18.525
God damn it!

35:18.776 --> 35:20.201
Come back here.

35:20.703 --> 35:22.155
She runs to get free.

35:22.643 --> 35:26.311
And she probably felt confident that
she had gotten away.

35:26.311 --> 35:29.003
And didn't realize the Cruz brothers
had a back-up plan.

35:29.003 --> 35:31.461
Homicide finally dug up the phone and
found records, by the way.

35:33.453 --> 35:35.821
Clavo, do not let her leave the building.

35:43.237 --> 35:45.422
Only cause she chose truth over money.

35:45.740 --> 35:47.112
The thing is Calleigh,

35:47.112 --> 35:50.311
unless there's a coon Berakas's evidence
Berakas, this evidence goes on ice.

35:53.571 --> 35:55.114
Berakas council turned me away.

35:55.114 --> 35:56.853
Wouldn't answer any questions.

35:56.853 --> 35:58.820
The brothers are closing ranks.

35:58.820 --> 36:01.750
However, other councils
who were more cooperative.

36:01.750 --> 36:04.523
Last sightings I have on Michelle was
open night at fashion week.

36:04.523 --> 36:08.127
People saw her
at the Neckadarin Council, Canadian Council..

36:08.127 --> 36:10.360
Wait a minute.
Did you say Canadian? / yes.

36:10.360 --> 36:11.762
And this has some special meaning?

36:11.762 --> 36:14.798
Could. Speed, if we process
the water in Michelle's lungs yet.

36:14.854 --> 36:16.355
Not that it matters.

36:16.536 --> 36:17.812
Speed.

36:17.955 --> 36:22.244
If we can't use forensics against guys
like Cruz then what exactly are we doing?

36:22.244 --> 36:24.776
I understand but I need the ingredients.
What are they?

36:24.776 --> 36:29.102
We got chlorine and activated carbon
impregnated with metallic silver.

36:29.371 --> 36:30.452
Silver ions?

36:30.452 --> 36:32.532
Filtration system is rare.

36:32.532 --> 36:34.951
Specially the parts per billion
this water presents.

36:34.951 --> 36:37.349
Okay. So what are
we talking about? /40.

36:38.689 --> 36:40.178
all right. Here's what we do.

36:40.178 --> 36:43.453
Let's go pay our neighbors
from the north a visit. All right?

36:47.181 --> 36:50.175
Detective Sallies reports that
Ramon Cruz was here

36:50.175 --> 36:53.622
at the Canadian Council with Michelle Cormier.

36:53.622 --> 36:56.196
This is Michelle.

36:58.737 --> 37:01.481
Last time I saw those two were
hitting out here at the pool.

37:06.369 --> 37:07.581
It was late.

37:07.695 --> 37:12.779
When we host big parties, it is difficult
to monitor everyone's activities.

37:12.906 --> 37:13.986
What have we got Speed?

37:13.986 --> 37:16.762
Same reaction as the water in Michelle's lungs.

37:17.252 --> 37:19.050
40 parts per billion.

37:19.358 --> 37:20.745
Most water's 20.

37:20.971 --> 37:22.380
Solar scan.

37:22.380 --> 37:26.034
Extra silver ions. / Actually What it means
is Michelle was killed right here

37:26.034 --> 37:28.966
on 10 acres of Canada right here
in the middle of Miami Beach.

37:28.966 --> 37:30.664
You're gonna be coming with me.

37:31.364 --> 37:33.576
If you're planning what I think you are,

37:33.820 --> 37:36.424
proximity to the crime is
only half the equation.

37:37.448 --> 37:39.344
Not when you're dealing with
a guy who has boundary issues.

37:39.344 --> 37:41.070
Hang on. Horatio.
Listen to me.

37:41.070 --> 37:43.879
I need the coast guard and
I need the Bahamian Defense Force.

37:44.124 --> 37:46.083
the Bahamian Defense Force.

37:55.051 --> 37:58.002
This is better fishing than Barakas, baby!

37:58.783 --> 38:00.521
Come to papa, come to papa.

38:05.044 --> 38:07.284
Dance. Dance.

38:13.760 --> 38:15.169
What you got?

38:16.124 --> 38:17.317
What the hell is that?

38:43.605 --> 38:45.889
This is the Bahamian Defense Force.

38:45.889 --> 38:49.339
Shut your engines and
prepare to be boarded.

38:49.779 --> 38:53.319
Attention! This is
the United States Coast Guard.

38:53.319 --> 38:56.692
Shut down your engines and
prepare to be boarded.

39:13.871 --> 39:16.106
In conjunction with the
United States Coast Guard,

39:16.106 --> 39:18.470
by decree of the Bahamian Defense Force,

39:18.470 --> 39:21.441
you are under arrest for
the murder of Michelle Cormier,

39:21.441 --> 39:22.878
a citizen of Canada.

39:22.878 --> 39:27.703
Crime perpetrated in Canadian Soil
at the Council in Miami Dade Florida.

39:27.703 --> 39:30.101
Canadian girl on Canadian soil.

39:30.302 --> 39:31.946
That's two out of three.

39:31.946 --> 39:33.050
I'm still immune.

39:33.050 --> 39:34.281
Actually you're not.

39:34.281 --> 39:35.745
Not on your boat.

39:35.745 --> 39:38.065
You're flying under the
flag of convenience.

39:38.065 --> 39:40.325
Just like the constables,
isn't that right constable?

39:40.325 --> 39:42.037
The Bahamian flag.

39:42.037 --> 39:44.961
Which gives me jurisdiction over you.

39:45.089 --> 39:46.022
That is correct.

39:46.022 --> 39:49.176
You never gave any thought to
how your father arranged your life.

39:49.176 --> 39:51.449
You just took with no questions asked.

39:51.449 --> 39:53.181
You still can't arrest me.

39:53.353 --> 39:54.546
I'm in Florida waters.

39:54.546 --> 39:56.331
Actually you're not in Florida waters.

39:56.331 --> 39:58.769
About 500 yards that way.

39:58.769 --> 40:00.812
You passed into international waters.

40:00.812 --> 40:04.290
The coast guard was waiting for
you to make that mistake.

40:06.068 --> 40:09.592
Now you have 50 years to think about
how you helped me in your arrest.

40:09.592 --> 40:11.693
And you, you watch your back.

40:11.693 --> 40:13.773
I'm not done with you.
Now gentlemen,

40:14.309 --> 40:15.659
it's been a pleasure.

40:16.474 --> 40:19.944
So remember Clavo,
when you're in Miami,

40:19.944 --> 40:23.807
we never close.

40:24.766 --> 40:26.741
Take him. / Let's go.

40:56.891 --> 40:59.414
Michelle Cormier's parents just flew in.

40:59.615 --> 41:00.585
I didn't know what to tell them.

41:00.585 --> 41:01.987
Okay I'll take it.

41:02.259 --> 41:04.165
You wanted to know why forensics?

41:05.967 --> 41:07.141
This is why.

41:10.058 --> 41:11.717
Mr. and Mrs. Cormier?

41:11.878 --> 41:13.383
Horatio Caine

41:22.826 --> 41:28.780
...now Michelle can rest in peace.
