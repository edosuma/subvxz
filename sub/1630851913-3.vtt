Our truck
was at the Imperial Valley border,

01:35.345 --> 01:36.387
but it didn't cross.

01:36.471 --> 01:38.389
Some shit about the tax.

01:38.473 --> 01:40.266
I fucking paid the tax, Azul!

01:41.142 --> 01:42.227
They said you didn't.

01:42.310 --> 01:43.561
Who said?

01:43.645 --> 01:44.771
Benjamín?

01:44.854 --> 01:46.064
Someone did.

01:48.107 --> 01:49.442

01:50.109 --> 01:51.861

02:03.289 --> 02:05.041
We'll talk to Benjamín.

02:05.125 --> 02:07.127
Make sure this doesn't happen again.

02:07.210 --> 02:08.378
[Chapo] How?

02:08.461 --> 02:09.838
It's time…

02:12.340 --> 02:15.009
we get our own piece of the border.

02:15.969 --> 02:17.345
Sure.

02:17.428 --> 02:19.973
Maybe they'll just
give us Tijuana. [scoffs]

02:23.059 --> 02:24.686
Or we just fucking take it.

02:25.979 --> 02:27.397
Settle down, Chapo.

02:28.940 --> 02:31.234
We <i>needed </i>that money, Azul!

The fucking desert?

15:00.274 --> 15:01.901
From Mexicali to Nogales.

It's worth it.

15:07.823 --> 15:09.742
We'll make it work.

a desert crossing, we'll talk.

16:29.780 --> 16:31.031
Thanks, Capi.

16:31.115 --> 16:32.282
[man] See you later.

16:45.170 --> 16:46.422
[in English] Hey, Mills.

16:46.505 --> 16:47.715
[Mills] Yeah?

16:47.798 --> 16:49.842
Anything come in from Juárez today?

16:51.051 --> 16:53.178
Jack shit. Same as yesterday.

16:56.348 --> 16:57.975

<i>It's our hope this impending</i>

16:58.058 --> 16:59.643

16:59.727 --> 17:02.938

17:03.022 --> 17:04.023
[knock at door]

17:04.106 --> 17:07.234
<i>Now, this deal effectively creates</i>
<i>one of the world's largest free trade…</i>

17:07.317 --> 17:08.694
[agent] Border keeps getting bigger

17:08.777 --> 17:11.947
and my budget keeps
changing not one fucking bit.

17:12.781 --> 17:15.242
<i>In fact, statistical models</i>
<i>we've run have shown…</i>

17:15.993 --> 17:17.077
What's up?

17:18.537 --> 17:20.622
Got a possible CI I want to run by you.

17:21.331 --> 17:22.374
They reached out?

17:24.376 --> 17:25.627
[Walt] Not exactly.

17:27.004 --> 17:28.505
<i>Now, does anybody have any questions?</i>

17:28.589 --> 17:30.132
Where do I fucking begin?

17:35.387 --> 17:36.388
How's Dani?

17:36.472 --> 17:37.639
She's great.

17:37.723 --> 17:39.266
She got a new job offer.

17:40.851 --> 17:42.478
Good for her, it's good for you, right?

17:43.312 --> 17:45.230
Yeah, I mean, it's good for her.

17:45.314 --> 17:46.899
Across the river, huh?

17:46.982 --> 17:47.900
Yes, sir.

17:48.984 --> 17:50.235
Worth the effort?

17:50.319 --> 17:52.863
[woman over radio] <i>Yeah, that's a question</i>
<i>for the El Paso station.</i>

17:52.946 --> 17:55.074
<i>-El Paso, are you there?</i>
-Be careful.

17:55.157 --> 17:56.492
[woman] <i>El Paso?</i>

17:57.242 --> 17:58.535
You got El Paso.

[music blaring over car stereo]

[Isaac exclaims]

18:33.987 --> 18:35.197
Dipshits.

18:36.323 --> 18:37.950
Not a crime to be rich.

18:38.617 --> 18:40.702
Seem to not like these people.

18:41.870 --> 18:42.996
I don't.

18:44.331 --> 18:46.041
My father worked his entire life -

18:46.792 --> 18:50.170
Never got close to sitting at the same
restaurant as these fucking people.

18:51.046 --> 18:54.591
What you get
for following the rules. [exhales]

18:59.138 --> 19:00.305
There's Hodoyan -

19:07.062 --> 19:08.856
[Andréa] Son of a bitch.

19:08.939 --> 19:10.232
[Isaac] Calm down.

19:11.316 --> 19:12.359
Follow him.

19:12.442 --> 19:13.360
[Andréa] No shit.

19:15.821 --> 19:18.490
-Go easy, okay?
-[Andréa] Fuck your mother, Isaac.

19:28.917 --> 19:30.210
[Andréa] Here we go.

19:39.511 --> 19:40.596
[sighs]

19:43.473 --> 19:45.225
[Isaac] A racetrack casino.

the dog-racing type to you?

[camera shutter clicks]

20:01.033 --> 20:02.075
Holy shit.

20:05.162 --> 20:07.206
-Get a shot of him.
-[Isaac] Okay, okay, okay.

20:07.289 --> 20:09.041
[camera shutter clicking]

20:09.958 --> 20:12.169
[Andréa] <i>We've been asking ourselves… why?</i>

20:14.129 --> 20:16.673
Why are the city's elite
associating with drug traffickers?

20:16.757 --> 20:20.093
Why are these "Narcojuniors"
running around with Ramón Arellano?

20:21.261 --> 20:22.221
Why?

20:23.722 --> 20:25.724
'Cause the Arellanos
are bankrolling Tijuana.

20:27.226 --> 20:31.063
Funding development
projects with drug profits.

20:31.855 --> 20:34.608
The parents don't care what their kids do…

20:36.568 --> 20:38.654
'cause it gets them closer to the money.

20:40.030 --> 20:42.074
That's quite speculative.

20:54.711 --> 20:55.963
This doesn't mean anything.

20:56.046 --> 21:01.510
It means Tijuana's biggest land developers
met with Benjamín Arellano Félix.

21:01.593 --> 21:03.428
Didn't look like the first time, either.

21:04.096 --> 21:07.099
What do they need drug money for?
They're already rich.

21:07.182 --> 21:10.060
Rich people always want more money.
That's why they're rich.

21:10.852 --> 21:12.813
And what do the Arellanos get?

21:12.896 --> 21:15.399
Security. Influence maybe.

21:18.402 --> 21:21.154
The questions you're asking…

21:22.197 --> 21:25.409
La Voz' is the only paper asking them.

21:26.994 --> 21:28.203
You have sources?

21:29.454 --> 21:30.789
I'm working on it.

21:30.872 --> 21:31.790
I'm close.

21:34.001 --> 21:35.711
We need to know how much money.

21:35.794 --> 21:37.796
And how they're distributing it.

21:38.797 --> 21:39.798
Stay on it.

21:41.925 --> 21:43.635
Isabela. What do you have?

21:43.719 --> 21:45.012
[indistinct chatter]

[Rogelio] Smells like booze.
You guys drinking?

21:56.106 --> 21:57.149
[in English] You speak Spanish?

21:57.858 --> 21:59.234

22:00.027 --> 22:01.278
[in English] Money.

[Rogelio in English] All right.

22:06.783 --> 22:07.909

22:12.122 --> 22:13.206
[in Spanish] Alright. Fuck off.

22:13.790 --> 22:15.125
Let's renew that insurance!

22:15.876 --> 22:18.837
Nothing but ones. Like a stripper.

22:18.920 --> 22:21.089
This isn't cutting it.

22:21.173 --> 22:23.050
Kids, food, rent.

22:23.133 --> 22:25.719
It'll pick up. Stop bitching, man.

22:25.802 --> 22:28.180
[Rogelio] It will? What a load of shit.

22:29.848 --> 22:31.558
How long since we made real money?

22:32.434 --> 22:34.936
-Not since Aguilar went down, right?
-[Victor] Mmm.

22:38.231 --> 22:40.692
Listen. The guys and me been talking.

22:42.235 --> 22:44.571
Maybe we get our hands on a package.

22:44.654 --> 22:46.448
Sell it ourselves, on the other side.

22:48.992 --> 22:52.287
Fuck no. Not how it works.

22:52.370 --> 22:56.041
I know, but fuck.

23:28.907 --> 23:30.534
Sorry…

23:30.617 --> 23:31.576
[in Spanish] I don't speak English.

23:31.660 --> 23:33.954
[in English] Spare me
the <i>"no hablo"</i> bullshit.

23:34.037 --> 23:36.289
I know you've got business on both sides.

Who says?

23:46.299 --> 23:48.135
DEA following a Juárez recruit.

23:50.053 --> 23:52.931
Few months back,
you had a tough night in El Paso.

23:53.682 --> 23:55.934
One of your guys, Luis Sato,
he didn't make it home.

23:57.185 --> 23:59.312
You left one of your boys
on the other side of the river, Victor.

23:59.396 --> 24:00.605
I don't know him.

24:00.689 --> 24:02.691
Sato flashed his Juárez Police ID
on his other guys.

24:02.774 --> 24:05.193
There were three other passengers
and you were one of them.

24:07.112 --> 24:11.032
Since when did the DEA
start caring about dead Mexican cops?

24:11.116 --> 24:13.910
Hey, assholes just
taking down other assholes.

24:13.994 --> 24:14.995
That's the game.

24:15.078 --> 24:17.914
Happy to forget all about it,
if we come to an arrangement.

24:19.749 --> 24:23.420
A cop like you,
he hears things and he sees things.

24:23.503 --> 24:25.755
-A cop like me?
-Yeah, a cop just like you.

24:27.841 --> 24:29.926
If you call me from time to time--

24:30.010 --> 24:31.595
You're looking for a girlfriend.

24:31.678 --> 24:32.721

24:36.183 --> 24:38.018
We already know Amado's running Juárez.

24:38.643 --> 24:41.271
I just need to know
how he's doing it and who's helping.

24:41.354 --> 24:44.107
Amado who? Never heard of him.

24:44.774 --> 24:46.067
Your shit got messy.

24:46.151 --> 24:48.445
If you fuck with me,
it's going to get a lot worse.

24:50.780 --> 24:52.073
I don't know, man.

24:52.949 --> 24:56.745
To be honest with you,
I don't use the phone that much.

24:57.579 --> 24:59.623
-It's expensive.
-Mmm.

25:07.297 --> 25:08.673
Number's on the card.

25:10.800 --> 25:12.552
-Call me.
-Okay.

25:12.636 --> 25:14.971
'Cause I sure as fuck
don't want to come back here.

25:18.683 --> 25:20.143
[Victor] What are you looking for, huh?

25:21.102 --> 25:22.062
Really.

25:25.523 --> 25:28.318
I told you, I want intel
on Amado Carillo Fuentes--

25:28.401 --> 25:29.402
Amado.

25:29.486 --> 25:32.364
You want to know about Amado?
I'm going to tell you about Amado.

25:32.906 --> 25:36.159
Amado wakes up,
he puts his fucking pants on

25:36.868 --> 25:38.203
and goes out into the world.

25:39.412 --> 25:42.457
He doesn't get what he needs,
I bet he motherfucking takes it.

25:43.750 --> 25:46.253
So, this guy you're looking for,

25:47.212 --> 25:48.880
he kind of sounds like you.

25:50.840 --> 25:53.760
Go home, Walt Breslin.

25:54.928 --> 25:58.890
Whatever you're looking for,
it isn't fucking here.

26:03.019 --> 26:04.896
May I advise you something?

26:05.647 --> 26:07.023
I'll give you a call. Hmm?

26:08.316 --> 26:09.150
[in Spanish] Okay.

It's temporary.

26:37.053 --> 26:39.014
I'm reorganizing.

26:43.059 --> 26:45.020
[Pacho] You killed your partner

26:46.021 --> 26:47.689
and you didn't have a plan?

26:49.232 --> 26:51.192
[Amado] I've got a plan, man.

26:52.986 --> 26:54.904
Seems like a pretty bad one.

26:57.949 --> 26:59.367
Felix goes down,

27:00.160 --> 27:01.619
everything falls apart?

27:01.703 --> 27:05.081
Nothing's falling apart, man.

27:06.791 --> 27:12.255
Tell the brothers
that it will be worth the wait.

27:14.257 --> 27:15.342
No.

27:18.470 --> 27:20.472
What's up, Pacho? What do I have to do?

27:21.056 --> 27:22.807
I don't have time for this.

27:22.891 --> 27:23.975
You're out.

27:25.018 --> 27:27.604
I need someone else to move Cali product.

27:27.687 --> 27:29.689
The Arellanos have asked for more.

27:30.857 --> 27:32.317
The Arellanos?

27:36.029 --> 27:41.076
Only way my coke goes to someone else
is over my dead body.

27:44.579 --> 27:47.999
Just don't fuck up
my carpet with your dead body.

27:49.417 --> 27:51.503
Business is business, Amado.

27:53.380 --> 27:55.006
Good luck, man.

28:03.765 --> 28:05.975
It's pretty good.

28:07.143 --> 28:08.520
[Benjamín] Look at these guys.

28:09.479 --> 28:11.689
Came all the way to Puerto Vallarta.

28:11.773 --> 28:12.607
[Azul] Good to see you.

28:13.775 --> 28:15.735
Help yourselves. Güero, Chapo.

28:15.819 --> 28:17.028
[Chapo] We're good, thanks.

28:18.571 --> 28:20.240
Happy birthday, Benjamín.

28:20.323 --> 28:21.282
Forty years old already?

28:21.366 --> 28:22.534
Yeah, 40. That's right.

28:22.617 --> 28:24.035
Life goes by quick.

28:24.744 --> 28:27.455
Come on, let's sit.

28:27.539 --> 28:28.456
Thank you.

28:29.457 --> 28:32.460
By the way.
That misunderstanding in the desert…

28:32.544 --> 28:34.337
Don't know what went wrong over there.

28:34.421 --> 28:36.589
Of course, we know.

28:37.549 --> 28:41.302
But that "misunderstanding"
cost us a lot of money, Benjamín.

28:41.386 --> 28:43.388
Yeah, I imagine it did.

28:43.471 --> 28:44.723
Unfortunate.

28:45.724 --> 28:47.684
Okay, well, it can't happen again.

28:48.351 --> 28:49.561
Come on, Chapo.

28:50.854 --> 28:53.440
You know this business
is unpredictable, right?

28:53.523 --> 28:55.150
[Güero] We understand.

28:55.233 --> 28:58.278
And we have a way around that.
Going forward.

28:59.612 --> 29:00.864
Let's hear it.

29:04.701 --> 29:06.619
We want that border.

29:07.412 --> 29:08.413
The Imperial Valley.

29:09.998 --> 29:13.877
It's nothing to you,
but for us it's enough.

29:16.087 --> 29:17.338
You want the desert?

29:18.590 --> 29:20.884
We want to<i> buy</i> the desert.

29:22.010 --> 29:23.845
You got the money for that?

29:25.513 --> 29:27.474
If it's a fair price, yes.

29:28.433 --> 29:29.601
We'll make it work.

29:38.276 --> 29:39.152
[inhales]

29:39.861 --> 29:40.779
Look.

29:42.030 --> 29:43.698
This is what we're gonna do.

29:46.409 --> 29:47.660
We'll give it to you.

29:48.453 --> 29:50.663
At three million a year, for two years.

29:50.747 --> 29:52.332
After that, we renegotiate.

29:54.501 --> 29:55.418
Hold on.

29:56.127 --> 29:56.961
You'll rent it to us?

30:00.173 --> 30:01.841
Thing is, Benjamín -

30:04.761 --> 30:07.138
we want the border.

30:07.222 --> 30:09.015
Free and clear.

30:09.682 --> 30:11.643
Can't do that, Güero.

30:14.103 --> 30:17.023
You lease it, we're hands off.

30:17.941 --> 30:19.567
Do what you want with it.

30:23.404 --> 30:25.865
What happens
if you change your mind in two years?

30:25.949 --> 30:28.910
I could sell it to you
and still change my mind.

30:30.245 --> 30:31.538
What's the difference?

30:35.834 --> 30:37.585
That the best you can do?

30:37.669 --> 30:40.755
That's the best we can do.

30:48.805 --> 30:49.764
[Güero] Okay.

30:52.892 --> 30:54.310
If that's what it is.

30:56.938 --> 30:58.523
That's what it is.
