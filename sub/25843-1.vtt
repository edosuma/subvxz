A NETFLIX ORIGINAL FILM

02:58.860 --> 03:00.500
Here! I found it!

03:01.518 --> 03:03.138
I found it.

03:03.393 --> 03:05.820
HQ? HQ, do you copy?

03:05.940 --> 03:09.975
HQ, we found an object
likely to belong to the victim...

03:38.860 --> 03:41.500
BUENOS AIRES, 14 YEARS LATER

05:01.980 --> 05:04.456
<i>...we have to remember
the uproar it caused</i>

05:04.540 --> 05:06.336
<i>in the police force in our country.</i>

05:06.420 --> 05:09.820
<i>Because here the protagonist,
the murderer,</i>

05:09.940 --> 05:12.536
<i>was none other than Pipo Larrabe,</i>

05:12.620 --> 05:14.256
<i>a boxing champion,</i>

05:14.340 --> 05:17.216
<i>loved and revered by the whole world,</i>

05:17.300 --> 05:21.616
<i>a man who had proudly represented
the Argentine flag to the world,</i>

05:21.700 --> 05:24.820
<i>and yet, he ends up killing his wife,
locked up...</i>

05:24.940 --> 05:27.820
<i>We'll devote today's program
to remembering him.</i>

05:27.940 --> 05:29.736
<i>He left a mark in history.</i>

05:29.820 --> 05:31.540
<i>In Argentine crime history...</i>

05:35.260 --> 05:38.096
<i>...Pipo Larrabe, world boxing champion,</i>

05:38.180 --> 05:41.736
<i>was found guilty of strangling
and throwing off of a balcony</i>

05:41.820 --> 05:44.416
<i>his wife and mother of his daughter.</i>

05:44.500 --> 05:46.176
<i>Her name was Ángela Larrabe, right?</i>

05:46.260 --> 05:50.976
<i>Ángela Larrabe, the champion's daughter,
was a child when her mother was murdered.</i>

05:51.060 --> 05:55.736
<i>She was the only witness
to her mom's murder by her dad.</i>

05:55.820 --> 05:58.696
<i>- What ever happened to that girl?
- You know, not much is known...</i>

05:58.780 --> 06:00.456
<i>By now she's a woman, logically.</i>

06:00.540 --> 06:04.940
<i>Last I heard she had left the country...</i>

06:27.940 --> 06:29.336
Relax.

06:29.420 --> 06:31.820
I'm with the Police,
everything is going to be okay.

06:33.129 --> 06:34.801
No! You can't...

06:34.885 --> 06:36.885
Be quiet!

06:38.300 --> 06:39.420
Be quiet.

07:01.821 --> 07:03.421
No!

07:08.500 --> 07:10.340
It's okay. It's over now.

07:16.140 --> 07:18.136
- Velázquez, how are you?
- Fine, thanks.

07:18.220 --> 07:20.300
- Where's Manuela Pelari?
- Over there, sir.

07:21.220 --> 07:22.576
How did you arrive so quickly?

07:22.660 --> 07:24.500
- I was nearby.
- What a coincidence!

07:26.740 --> 07:28.976
What happened? Are you okay?

07:29.060 --> 07:30.060
Yes, it's not mine.

07:31.100 --> 07:32.820
The detective went in alone.

07:32.940 --> 07:35.736
You would've done the same.
Isn't that what you taught me?

07:35.820 --> 07:37.976
I also taught you about teamwork.

07:38.060 --> 07:40.220
You can't go in without a warrant!

07:41.060 --> 07:42.936
You've put the entire operation at risk.

07:43.020 --> 07:45.004
The perpetrator is
on his way to the hospital.

07:45.089 --> 07:46.259
She almost beat him to death.

07:46.344 --> 07:48.536
The detective only cares
about the perpetrator.

07:48.620 --> 07:50.256
No, but I don't want him released.

07:50.340 --> 07:52.936
I got a tip from a witness,

07:53.020 --> 07:55.296
apparently he heard screaming.

07:55.380 --> 07:56.776
Chief, the cameras are here.

07:56.860 --> 07:58.300
What do we do about the press?

08:00.100 --> 08:03.100
Well, it's important news.
You know the drill...

08:04.460 --> 08:05.820
The mission was a success,

08:05.940 --> 08:08.616
teamwork, blah, blah, blah...

08:08.700 --> 08:10.860
Okay? Six months of investigation, got it?

08:10.980 --> 08:13.940
- Pass.
- I'm not going to face them this time.

08:14.940 --> 08:17.100
And yet you came prepared.

08:18.700 --> 08:20.020
Okay, I'll handle it.

08:30.180 --> 08:33.140
You're turning your partners against you.

08:37.659 --> 08:39.299
Martín is a good cop.

08:43.780 --> 08:45.780
Don't forget who your family is.

08:51.860 --> 08:53.616
Good job, but it will be your last.

08:53.700 --> 08:55.820
You can't save them all.

08:57.500 --> 08:59.140
You get too involved.

08:59.620 --> 09:01.780
It's the only thing
I get involved in, Ramón.

09:17.060 --> 09:22.089
DESPERATE SEARCH FOR MISSING CHILD

09:56.180 --> 10:00.100
<i>You have two new voice messages.</i>

10:02.980 --> 10:05.340
<i>Hello, Manuela. It's Clara Villalba.</i>

10:05.860 --> 10:08.776
<i>I need to see you tomorrow
during Cornelia's mass.</i>

10:08.860 --> 10:12.260
<i>It's at 10:00,
at the Inmaculada Concepción Church.</i>

10:42.427 --> 10:45.218
Me too. I'm so hungry!

10:46.460 --> 10:47.620
Let's go.

10:51.204 --> 10:52.586
Look over there!

10:55.420 --> 10:57.656
It's so nice. It's snowing.

10:57.740 --> 10:59.776
Good, we won't have to go
on the excursions.

10:59.860 --> 11:01.456
But I wanted to see the volcano.

11:01.540 --> 11:03.536
No, Pipa, they're going to give us
a bunch of homework.

11:03.620 --> 11:04.820
No, she's right.

11:04.940 --> 11:06.656
Anyway, I'm sleeping by myself.

11:06.740 --> 11:08.860
- I'm sleeping with Pipa, okay?
- Yeah!

11:08.980 --> 11:11.300
Girls, let's go, it's freezing.

11:12.940 --> 11:14.140
Ariel?

14:00.912 --> 14:01.936
Clara.

14:02.020 --> 14:03.456
You didn't come to mass.

14:03.540 --> 14:05.980
I did, but it had already finished.

14:07.660 --> 14:10.100
Here are Cornelia's things.

14:10.660 --> 14:12.416
The ones the Police returned to me.

14:12.500 --> 14:15.820
I've been keeping them for years,
hoping something can be done.

14:17.300 --> 14:18.860
I want you to take a look, Pipa.

14:33.540 --> 14:35.380
Come with me for a moment, please.

14:43.112 --> 14:44.592
<i>You're the only one who can help me</i>

14:44.769 --> 14:46.649
figure out what happened to my daughter.

14:48.340 --> 14:50.300
But you know perfectly well what happened.

14:51.460 --> 14:53.260
The case was closed years ago.

14:54.340 --> 14:55.740
The body was never found.

14:56.580 --> 14:58.576
Due to the ashes
from the volcano's eruption,

14:58.660 --> 15:00.700
it was almost impossible
to go on with the search.

15:03.420 --> 15:06.500
Sometimes, when I wake up,
I forget she's not there.

15:07.220 --> 15:09.296
And sometimes I think I see her
on the streets,

15:09.380 --> 15:12.140
in some girl who looks like her.

15:13.700 --> 15:16.700
Then I think, "No, that's not my girl."

15:17.700 --> 15:19.180
She's a woman now.

15:21.260 --> 15:22.940
A woman like you.

15:26.980 --> 15:28.616
Some part of what I'm telling you

15:28.700 --> 15:30.620
must also happen to you.

15:35.055 --> 15:37.696
If you submitted this obituary,

15:37.780 --> 15:40.220
it's because you're not over it yet.

15:42.100 --> 15:44.096
You were her best friend.

15:44.180 --> 15:45.860
Like sisters.

15:45.980 --> 15:48.376
I'm not blaming you,
but I can't understand

15:48.460 --> 15:51.056
how she could just disappear like that.

15:51.140 --> 15:52.496
Out of nowhere.

15:52.580 --> 15:54.980
Right in front of her friends.

15:55.500 --> 15:57.140
I'm really sorry about what happened.

15:57.620 --> 16:02.496
I didn't come here to criticize,
or to listen to excuses.

16:02.580 --> 16:04.820
I want you to do your job.

16:04.940 --> 16:07.100
I want Cornelia back.

16:07.980 --> 16:10.847
Clara, I know how hard it must be
for you and your family.

16:11.418 --> 16:13.776
- But I don't quite get what you're asking.
- You don't?

16:13.860 --> 16:15.140
No one gets it.

16:16.100 --> 16:17.656
You're a cop.

16:17.740 --> 16:20.536
You can look at the case again.

16:20.620 --> 16:22.416
One more time.

16:22.500 --> 16:24.660
See if they missed anything.

16:28.740 --> 16:30.420
You're not wearing the necklace anymore?

16:31.236 --> 16:32.149
No.

16:32.980 --> 16:34.460
I haven't in years.

16:35.460 --> 16:37.020
I'll let you know if I have any news.

16:37.740 --> 16:39.140
It's part of my job.

16:41.860 --> 16:43.380
It's more than that.

16:44.980 --> 16:46.580
It's part of your life.

17:13.060 --> 17:14.006
Get up!

17:14.090 --> 17:14.976
Come on!

17:15.060 --> 17:16.776
Come on, man. Come on, Alina!

17:16.859 --> 17:18.215
- Who are you?
- Come on!

17:18.300 --> 17:20.136
I'm the Police, man. Come on, get up.

17:20.220 --> 17:22.096
- Come on, take the drugs.
- Stop, okay.

17:22.180 --> 17:23.935
Come on. Come on, go.

17:24.020 --> 17:25.336
Go! Come on.

17:25.420 --> 17:26.346
Take the drugs.

17:26.431 --> 17:28.696
If anything happens to her,
you're going to jail, you hear me?

17:28.780 --> 17:30.579
Go on.

17:35.460 --> 17:36.460
Alina?

17:40.060 --> 17:41.060
Alina.

17:44.100 --> 17:45.100
Alina!

17:55.580 --> 17:56.580
Here.

17:59.500 --> 18:01.936
Don't think it'll look much better.

18:02.020 --> 18:03.740
The picture isn't even digital.

18:04.460 --> 18:07.060
I removed all the reflections
from the glass. There you go.

18:08.140 --> 18:09.776
That's why I wanted you to improve it.

18:09.860 --> 18:11.976
I need the original.

18:12.060 --> 18:13.860
I can't promise I'll be able to do much.

18:13.980 --> 18:15.416
What about the obituary?

18:15.500 --> 18:17.656
Can you trace who submitted it?

18:17.740 --> 18:20.340
Did they pay by card?
What was the agency?

18:22.620 --> 18:23.776
Who is she?

18:23.860 --> 18:25.100
None of your business.

18:26.660 --> 18:28.496
Stop raiding my house, Pipa.

18:28.580 --> 18:30.936
I need you lucid, it's important.

18:31.020 --> 18:33.740
She vanished into thin air.
We never heard from her again.

18:35.140 --> 18:36.060
An accident.

18:37.780 --> 18:39.820
If it was an accident,
what are you looking for?

18:39.940 --> 18:40.936
Is it a new case?

18:41.020 --> 18:41.861
Personal.

18:43.020 --> 18:45.140
All cases are personal to you.

18:45.940 --> 18:46.936
Here.

18:47.020 --> 18:49.056
A copy to hang on your wall.

18:49.140 --> 18:51.260
I know it's not a case,
but you may need it.

18:52.860 --> 18:53.780
Thank you.

18:54.860 --> 18:56.300
I'll be taking your statement.

18:56.740 --> 18:58.536
You'll be the witness for the break-in.

18:58.620 --> 19:00.576
You promised me
I wouldn't have to testify.

19:00.660 --> 19:02.336
- You know I hate...
- Stop it, Alina.

19:02.420 --> 19:04.346
I've had a shitty day
and it hasn't even started.

19:46.540 --> 19:48.576
- Father?
- Yes?

19:48.660 --> 19:50.776
I'm here for Cornelia Villalba's photo.

19:50.860 --> 19:52.456
It was on the lectern.

19:52.540 --> 19:54.136
The girl from today's mass.

19:54.220 --> 19:56.380
- Yes.
- They just took it.

19:57.300 --> 19:58.976
- Who?
- A man.

19:59.060 --> 20:01.860
He said he was here
on behalf of the family, I don't know.

20:02.620 --> 20:04.096
He just left.

20:04.180 --> 20:05.021
Thank you.

20:56.860 --> 20:58.540
FRIENDS FOREVER

21:36.980 --> 21:38.936
You look so pretty,
I don't know what to wear.

21:39.020 --> 21:39.861
Thank you.

21:39.980 --> 21:41.940
- Can you help me?
- Yeah, I'll help you.

21:44.700 --> 21:46.100
What do you think of Ariel?

21:46.660 --> 21:48.456
He's cute, but forget it.

21:48.540 --> 21:50.540
Leonora called dibs so...

21:51.740 --> 21:52.696
I like this one.

21:52.780 --> 21:54.976
- Is it new?
- Yeah, I bought it the other day.

21:55.060 --> 21:56.580
- Let's see it.
- It's nice.

22:01.740 --> 22:03.136
Let me help you.

22:03.220 --> 22:04.100
Thanks.

22:14.740 --> 22:15.736
Either way...

22:15.820 --> 22:16.780
he likes me.

22:31.700 --> 22:34.820
Clara said you wanted to talk to us
about something related to Cornelia.

22:34.940 --> 22:35.940
Yes.

22:36.940 --> 22:39.820
And what does that have to do with us?

22:39.940 --> 22:42.220
I'm looking over some stuff
related to the case.

22:44.540 --> 22:45.660
I'm looking for this photo.

22:46.500 --> 22:48.540
One of you provided it.

22:49.340 --> 22:51.456
No. It doesn't look very good.

22:51.540 --> 22:52.660
She looks angry.

22:54.460 --> 22:55.700
Cornelia was like that.

22:59.300 --> 23:02.136
Maybe the photo was taken there.
It seems to be from around that time.

23:02.220 --> 23:04.860
I also want to know
who submitted this obituary.

23:06.820 --> 23:08.620
Was it any of you?

23:10.180 --> 23:12.820
"Half of your absence is love."

23:13.620 --> 23:14.500
What does that mean?

23:15.980 --> 23:16.821
I don't know.

23:18.380 --> 23:19.616
Any idea?

23:19.700 --> 23:21.980
I don't know, not really from this.

23:22.620 --> 23:23.936
Let me think about it.

23:24.020 --> 23:25.500
It wasn't the Villalbas.

23:26.980 --> 23:28.740
Clara thought it had been me.

23:29.500 --> 23:31.620
The family didn't place the photo either?

23:32.220 --> 23:33.496
Weird, right?

23:33.580 --> 23:35.696
Look, Pipa, I don't understand.

23:35.780 --> 23:37.456
Why are you doing this now?

23:37.540 --> 23:38.656
And why not before?

23:38.740 --> 23:42.220
Do you know anything about Cornelia
that you're not telling us about?

23:43.180 --> 23:44.100
No.

23:46.478 --> 23:47.336
What about you?

23:47.420 --> 23:50.336
You know more than anyone
that the matter was closed long ago.

23:50.420 --> 23:53.296
There's nothing to explain.
Cornelia got lost.

23:53.380 --> 23:56.500
A puma ate her, or some other animal.

23:57.580 --> 23:59.140
Don't you ever think about that night?

23:59.980 --> 24:00.821
Yes.

24:02.540 --> 24:03.580
She died.

24:05.100 --> 24:06.736
We have to accept it.

24:06.820 --> 24:08.136
The body was never found.

24:08.220 --> 24:09.536
And are you going to find it?

24:09.620 --> 24:11.980
It's nice of her to care, right?

24:14.420 --> 24:17.536
- Then why didn't she go to mass?
- Leonora, stop.

24:17.620 --> 24:20.456
If someone actually knows
why Cornelia left the inn,

24:20.540 --> 24:21.980
it's not any of us.

24:22.820 --> 24:25.416
You were always together,
you were best friends.

24:25.500 --> 24:26.536
Yes.

24:26.620 --> 24:28.696
We were best friends.

24:28.780 --> 24:30.016
I'm sorry.

24:30.100 --> 24:31.736
I'm sorry, girls.

24:31.820 --> 24:35.728
But every time I think about Cornelia,
I believe we are over the issue.

24:35.869 --> 24:37.311
That's not the case.

24:37.624 --> 24:40.540
Here we are,
fighting like little girls, again.

24:41.820 --> 24:44.940
Hi, sweetie!

24:46.980 --> 24:48.016
Let's go, Rodrigo.

24:48.100 --> 24:49.496
Can I use my PlayStation?

24:49.580 --> 24:51.336
Yes, you can.

24:51.420 --> 24:53.096
He attends our school.

24:53.180 --> 24:56.016
Yes. My whole family went to Dullmich.

24:56.100 --> 24:57.256
How old is he?

24:57.340 --> 25:00.216
Seven, his birthday is next week,
on the 18th.

25:00.300 --> 25:01.660
You're leaving, Pipa?

25:02.580 --> 25:03.936
- Yes.
- I'll see you out.

25:04.020 --> 25:05.580
No. Thank you.

25:10.540 --> 25:12.100
It's done, Mermaid.

25:14.420 --> 25:15.616
Is she lucid?

25:15.700 --> 25:16.776
Yes.

25:16.860 --> 25:19.140
The last one you brought me
couldn't even walk.

25:20.100 --> 25:21.660
She better not have any bruises.

25:23.380 --> 25:25.656
Four Venezuelans arrived today.

25:25.740 --> 25:28.016
- They're in bad shape.
- Then why are they here?

25:28.100 --> 25:29.256
They're here on loan.

25:29.340 --> 25:31.020
Treat them and put them to work.

25:36.220 --> 25:37.940
I bought two sizes just in case.

25:42.860 --> 25:43.980
Have you fed her?

25:45.180 --> 25:46.736
- Yes.
- You know how it goes...

25:46.820 --> 25:48.820
The client has until 12:00,
not a minute more.

25:48.940 --> 25:50.416
Keep your eyes on her, and then...

25:50.500 --> 25:51.776
you put her back with the rest.

25:51.860 --> 25:52.860
What about the Egyptian?

25:54.300 --> 25:55.700
The Egyptian won't know a thing.

26:00.500 --> 26:02.100
She's a virgin and she's mine.

26:03.033 --> 26:04.576
She's worth her weight in gold,
you know it.

26:04.660 --> 26:06.860
That's what I'm referring to,
she's a virgin.

26:06.980 --> 26:09.580
- If the Egyptian finds out...
- I've told you, I'll deal with him.

26:12.060 --> 26:13.656
Whatever you say.

26:13.740 --> 26:15.260
Have you done what I asked?

26:16.500 --> 26:17.460
Yes.

26:30.340 --> 26:31.940
I came across this cop today.

26:36.060 --> 26:39.056
POLICE SUCCESS
IN HUMAN TRAFFICKING CASE

26:39.140 --> 26:40.340
Are you sure?

26:41.159 --> 26:42.016
Yes.

26:42.100 --> 26:44.020
She was at the church.

26:47.540 --> 26:48.660
Who's the girl in the photo?

26:49.580 --> 26:51.740
No one. A deal that went south.

26:53.380 --> 26:56.096
- None of your business.
- It is, if the Police are involved.

26:56.180 --> 26:57.340
Can we talk about this later?

26:59.460 --> 27:00.380
Let's go.

27:07.180 --> 27:08.540
Do you know who I am?

27:09.980 --> 27:11.860
Welcome to your new life.

27:11.980 --> 27:14.140
The sooner you get used to it, the better.

27:17.060 --> 27:19.976
If you don't want to have any trouble,
do everything I say.

27:20.060 --> 27:21.140
Okay?

27:24.060 --> 27:25.060
Good.

27:27.300 --> 27:28.860
Now put this on.

28:21.060 --> 28:25.340
CANARY ISLANDS, SEVEN YEARS BEFORE

28:31.300 --> 28:32.740
Come on!

28:35.260 --> 28:36.780
You too.

28:38.140 --> 28:39.500
Move it.

29:02.500 --> 29:04.100
This is a message.

29:04.700 --> 29:07.100
They disfigured them
so they can't work anymore.

29:08.020 --> 29:09.496
What a waste.

29:09.580 --> 29:11.940
They were our best girls. What do we do?

29:12.940 --> 29:14.500
They're useless now.

29:16.740 --> 29:18.660
We have to take them off the market.

29:20.580 --> 29:21.460
Get going.

29:21.980 --> 29:23.216
Come on.

29:23.300 --> 29:24.580
Move your ass!

29:52.020 --> 29:55.100
She and I are going to live.

30:00.340 --> 30:01.460
Mermaid.

30:19.260 --> 30:20.340
How are you?

30:24.100 --> 30:26.660
The doctor says he's going
to take the bandages off soon.

30:30.700 --> 30:32.060
What's wrong?

30:34.300 --> 30:35.656
I have to leave.

30:35.740 --> 30:37.976
You'll be on your own.

30:38.060 --> 30:39.976
- Now?
- Yes.

30:40.060 --> 30:42.616
- The Egyptian took flight.
- Spain isn't safe anymore.

30:42.700 --> 30:44.140
What do you mean he took flight?

30:48.340 --> 30:49.300
Where?

30:52.540 --> 30:53.740
To Argentina.

30:57.940 --> 30:59.020
Take me.

31:00.580 --> 31:02.340
I've got an offer for him.

31:03.940 --> 31:06.100
You want to go back to him
after he ordered your death?

31:11.740 --> 31:12.740
He's already killed me.

31:15.340 --> 31:17.020
What else can he do to me?

31:20.260 --> 31:21.300
What about her?

31:25.620 --> 31:27.420
Lucrecia will come, too.

31:28.740 --> 31:30.736
She'll work for us

31:30.820 --> 31:33.020
to repay us for saving her life.

31:33.534 --> 31:34.649
It's dangerous.

31:35.740 --> 31:36.976
The Egyptian trusts no one.

31:37.060 --> 31:38.016
He trusts you.

31:38.214 --> 31:40.054
And that's all it takes.

31:40.261 --> 31:42.105
What about your pregnancy?

31:48.100 --> 31:50.776
There's nothing left for us to do here.

31:50.860 --> 31:53.860
FEDERAL POLICE

32:01.540 --> 32:03.380
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

32:18.540 --> 32:19.820
Where were you, Manuela?

32:21.140 --> 32:22.580
The boss was looking for you.

32:23.420 --> 32:24.736
Where were you yesterday?

32:24.820 --> 32:25.976
Oreyana?

32:26.060 --> 32:28.456
New boyfriend keeping you busy?

32:28.540 --> 32:29.580
No...

32:30.460 --> 32:32.376
Manuela doesn't have time for boyfriends.

32:32.460 --> 32:34.620
Or to fill out reports.

32:35.700 --> 32:36.620
She's beyond that.

32:38.620 --> 32:40.580
I don't have time
for your bullshit, Martín.

32:41.460 --> 32:43.136
Here are some notes for the report.

32:43.220 --> 32:44.420
Hey, look at that.

32:46.100 --> 32:48.140
Now I don't have the time for it.

32:49.140 --> 32:51.420
I'd rather you told us about you,
about your life.

32:52.580 --> 32:54.140
Do you like acting like the oddball?

32:55.780 --> 32:56.936
I know where you come from.

32:57.020 --> 32:58.380
You know nothing about my life.

32:59.340 --> 33:00.296
Let me through.

33:00.380 --> 33:02.532
You think you can get away with anything
because you're the favorite.

33:03.358 --> 33:05.533
But if the chief gets promoted...
Who's going to cover for you?

33:05.618 --> 33:07.456
You'll need some other "dad"
to take care of you.

33:07.540 --> 33:08.696
What's your problem, Seretti?

33:08.780 --> 33:11.136
My problem is that we're always
cleaning up your shit, Manuela.

33:11.220 --> 33:12.136
That's my problem.

33:12.220 --> 33:13.860
- I didn't ask you to.
- You don't have to.

33:14.700 --> 33:17.042
You must have
a certain charm...

33:18.100 --> 33:19.540
that we're not aware of.

33:24.460 --> 33:25.620
Don't be a smartass.

33:31.580 --> 33:32.421
Pelari.

33:33.020 --> 33:34.180
My office.

33:36.832 --> 33:37.912
Crazy bitch.

33:48.820 --> 33:50.620
Have you lost your mind or what?

33:51.540 --> 33:53.136
I get that a lot lately.

33:53.220 --> 33:54.536
Don't play stupid with me.

33:54.620 --> 33:56.776
You can't attack a coworker
in front of everyone.

33:56.860 --> 33:58.576
You're provoking them.

33:58.660 --> 34:01.860
You proceed alone on a six-month operative
and then you disappear

34:01.980 --> 34:03.976
precisely when the DA needs to see you.

34:04.060 --> 34:06.456
And now you lash out against
the only person who covers for you.

34:06.540 --> 34:08.735
Do you want to get suspended?

34:08.820 --> 34:12.139
- I'm having a bad day.
- You're having a bad day.

34:13.980 --> 34:15.376
I need your support, Ramón.

34:15.460 --> 34:18.060
Like I don't support you enough.

34:24.420 --> 34:25.696
What happened?

34:25.780 --> 34:27.255
Take some days off if you want.

34:27.340 --> 34:29.576
It'll do you good,
lower the tension around here.

34:29.659 --> 34:30.656
No, it's not that.

34:30.739 --> 34:32.096
I'm on a case.

34:32.179 --> 34:33.335
What case?

34:33.420 --> 34:35.139
Cornelia Villalba's.

34:37.020 --> 34:39.056
I was at her 14th anniversary mass
yesterday.

34:39.139 --> 34:42.295
There's an obituary
that no one knows who wrote it,

34:42.380 --> 34:45.335
and a photo that no one knows
who took it or put it there.

34:45.420 --> 34:47.775
Cornelia Villalba...

34:47.860 --> 34:49.420
Yes, I know it sounds crazy.

34:50.020 --> 34:51.620
But I'm sure there's more to it.

34:53.739 --> 34:55.056
Like what?

34:55.139 --> 34:57.460
Maybe she wasn't eaten
by a puma or got lost.

34:58.220 --> 34:59.256
Maybe she was killed.

34:59.340 --> 35:02.860
Pipa, you very well know
that I handled this case personally.

35:02.980 --> 35:04.100
Nobody killed her.

35:05.220 --> 35:08.056
It was a tragedy, a misfortune
that took you a long time to get over.

35:08.140 --> 35:09.536
There is no Villalba case.

35:09.620 --> 35:12.136
We've gone over it a thousand times,
too many times.

35:12.220 --> 35:14.820
Many years.
And I did it especially for you.

35:14.940 --> 35:15.820
I know, but look.

35:17.153 --> 35:18.621
What about it?

35:19.580 --> 35:22.016
That's how she was dressed
on the last night.

35:22.100 --> 35:23.736
That blouse was new.

35:23.820 --> 35:25.296
I picked it out for her myself.

35:25.380 --> 35:26.416
Look at her neck.

35:26.500 --> 35:28.980
She's not wearing the necklace
we found the day of the search.

35:30.260 --> 35:31.536
We each had one.

35:31.620 --> 35:33.456
We swore to always wear them.

35:33.540 --> 35:36.496
And what of it?
How can you remember something like that?

35:36.580 --> 35:39.016
Maybe she took a shower
and forgot to put it back on.

35:39.100 --> 35:41.216
No. She didn't forget!

35:41.300 --> 35:43.016
She never forgot.

35:43.100 --> 35:46.456
The conclusion was
that she had come back with us.

35:46.540 --> 35:49.860
She felt bad afterwards,
so she went into the woods and got lost.

35:49.980 --> 35:52.176
That's where the necklace was found.

35:52.260 --> 35:54.336
But now there's another possibility.

35:54.420 --> 35:57.136
What if she got lost elsewhere
and someone planted the necklace?

35:57.220 --> 36:00.580
That was the only proof
of her coming back with us to the inn.

36:01.260 --> 36:04.616
As well as your friends' statements,
including your own,

36:04.700 --> 36:06.616
saying you all came back
together that night.

36:06.700 --> 36:09.940
You're looking for any excuse
to obsess over Cornelia.

36:10.740 --> 36:13.376
You taught me to look
at the inconsistent details.

36:13.460 --> 36:14.696
Yes.

36:14.780 --> 36:17.260
And I'm beginning to regret
teaching you that.

36:19.260 --> 36:21.580
I can't go along
with all of your crazy ideas.

36:23.460 --> 36:27.736
Manuela, you promised me
that Cornelia would stay in the past.

36:27.820 --> 36:30.336
You can't change what happened.

36:30.420 --> 36:32.016
Plus it was my condition to help you.

36:32.100 --> 36:34.416
Ramón, you're the only one
who can understand me.

36:34.500 --> 36:35.736
Give me two days.

36:35.820 --> 36:37.660
If not, I promise I'll drop it.

36:42.180 --> 36:45.700
I don't know, this whole time I thought
you had moved on with your life.

36:46.364 --> 36:48.260
God knows I tried with you.

36:49.180 --> 36:51.336
I want you to start seeing
the therapist again.

36:51.420 --> 36:52.820
You can't be on the streets.

36:52.940 --> 36:55.580
I can't go around covering for you
all the time.

36:57.460 --> 36:59.536
You have a department meeting, sir.

36:59.620 --> 37:00.736
Yes.

37:00.820 --> 37:02.336
Ramón?

37:02.420 --> 37:03.340
No.

37:04.540 --> 37:05.540
Not this time.

37:06.340 --> 37:08.256
Forget about the Villalba case.

37:08.340 --> 37:09.740
That's an order.

37:12.540 --> 37:14.540
ARGENTINE POLICE DEPARTMENT

37:30.860 --> 37:32.820
- No!
- Why are you following me?

37:33.700 --> 37:34.820
Detective Oreyana?

37:35.780 --> 37:36.940
Ramón Oreyana?

37:37.860 --> 37:40.626
- Who are you?
- Manuela Pelari. Pipa.

37:41.573 --> 37:44.020
Cornelia Villalba's friend.
Do you remember me?

37:47.980 --> 37:50.016
How can I help you, Manuela? I'm all ears.

37:50.100 --> 37:51.660
You promised me something.

37:52.860 --> 37:54.376
You told me Cornelia was alive.

37:54.460 --> 37:56.096
At that time I thought she was.

37:56.180 --> 37:58.496
- You told me that...
- I remember very well what I told you.

37:58.580 --> 38:00.540
But it's been four years.

38:01.660 --> 38:03.216
The case is closed.

38:03.300 --> 38:05.100
It's over, what do you want?

38:06.940 --> 38:08.420
I want to know everything.

38:09.060 --> 38:10.456
I need to understand.

38:10.540 --> 38:11.820
Let me see the investigation.

38:16.700 --> 38:19.980
Do you really think
I can show you anything?

38:21.740 --> 38:23.180
I owe you nothing.

38:24.660 --> 38:28.100
The best you can do
is take care of your own life.

38:29.883 --> 38:30.940
Where do you live?

38:31.540 --> 38:34.296
- Do your parents know you're here?
- Teach me.

38:34.380 --> 38:35.976
- Teach you what?
- To be like you.

38:36.060 --> 38:37.620
You have no idea what you're saying.

38:39.140 --> 38:41.340
You want to be a cop? Look at you.

38:44.380 --> 38:46.860
The first thing you need to do
is stop consuming.

38:46.980 --> 38:49.060
That stuff is ruining your life.

38:50.460 --> 38:51.301
Teach me.

38:54.860 --> 38:55.940
You owe it to me.

38:58.980 --> 39:00.456
<i>Well, we're going to begin, okay?</i>

39:00.540 --> 39:04.616
<i>Please, state your full name,
age, address.</i>

39:04.700 --> 39:05.976
<i>To the camera, please.</i>

39:06.060 --> 39:07.820
<i>Leonora Durán Esquivel.</i>

39:07.940 --> 39:09.176
<i>I'm 14 years old.</i>

39:09.260 --> 39:11.056
<i>I live at 2016 Superí Street.</i>

39:11.425 --> 39:14.873
<i>You and your friends went alone,
without the rest of the class.</i>

39:14.958 --> 39:17.216
<i>Why? What did you think
of your Geography teacher's idea</i>

39:17.300 --> 39:18.616
<i>of going on a trip to the South?</i>

39:18.700 --> 39:21.776
<i>Because you went to explore
the Tunik volcano, right?</i>

39:21.860 --> 39:23.860
Yes. We thought it was fun,

39:23.980 --> 39:27.056
not the volcano stuff,
but traveling together all five of us.

39:27.140 --> 39:31.020
<i>And how was your relationship
with Cornelia Villalba?</i>

39:31.740 --> 39:33.936
I've known her my whole life.

39:34.020 --> 39:34.861
She was...

39:36.220 --> 39:37.736
She's my best friend.

39:37.820 --> 39:38.780
Yes.

39:39.660 --> 39:41.180
Best friends.

39:42.260 --> 39:44.456
We were best friends.

39:44.540 --> 39:46.420
Cornelia and Pipa even more so.

39:47.180 --> 39:49.296
Leonora Durán was always...

39:49.380 --> 39:52.860
a bit jealous, she always
wanted to be the center of attention.

39:52.980 --> 39:54.536
What about you?

39:54.620 --> 39:56.416
You weren't jealous?

39:56.500 --> 39:58.580
They let me be in the group.

39:59.420 --> 40:02.576
It's like "the" group at school.

40:02.660 --> 40:04.096
You know?

40:04.180 --> 40:05.700
Leonora's like our boss.

40:06.660 --> 40:07.576
And Cornelia?

40:07.660 --> 40:08.780
Cornelia?

40:09.820 --> 40:11.620
Cornelia only cared about Pipa.

40:41.060 --> 40:41.901
Want some, Pipa?

40:45.540 --> 40:47.700
Leo, Ariel keeps looking at you.

41:00.860 --> 41:03.296
The idea was to do something fun.

41:03.380 --> 41:04.820
Get out for a bit.

41:05.620 --> 41:07.416
Ariel was going to take us in his truck

41:07.500 --> 41:10.376
and bring us back
to the hotel in the morning.

41:10.460 --> 41:12.860
You don't recall seeing anything
out of the ordinary?

41:12.980 --> 41:14.616
Maybe you met someone?

41:14.700 --> 41:17.420
No, no one.
We didn't do anything, I swear.

41:18.260 --> 41:20.456
And what was wrong with Cornelia?

41:20.540 --> 41:21.696
Was she feeling sick?

41:21.780 --> 41:23.176
Did you drink too much?

41:23.260 --> 41:26.016
I don't know.
We drank, but she was okay.

41:26.100 --> 41:28.136
And when did you decide to go back?

41:28.220 --> 41:30.820
When Leonora decided to.
She said it was late.

41:30.940 --> 41:32.860
And then what?

41:32.980 --> 41:34.136
Nothing, we went back.

41:34.220 --> 41:35.616
And after that?

41:35.700 --> 41:36.976
Nothing.

41:37.060 --> 41:38.576
We went to sleep.

41:38.660 --> 41:41.301
We went to sleep and...

41:41.780 --> 41:44.340
When we woke up, Cornelia wasn't there.

41:45.740 --> 41:47.340
How did you go back?

41:49.780 --> 41:51.500
With Ariel.

41:52.140 --> 41:53.460
In his truck.

41:54.700 --> 41:56.700
And you never separated?

41:58.500 --> 41:59.700
No.

42:00.980 --> 42:01.860
No.

42:05.020 --> 42:06.020
No.

42:06.620 --> 42:08.456
Would you, please, tell me again

42:08.540 --> 42:12.616
how you were seated in Ariel's truck
when you came back?

42:12.700 --> 42:14.256
I was in front.

42:14.340 --> 42:16.296
And Cornelia by the window.

42:16.380 --> 42:19.136
Who was sitting next to Cornelia,
do you recall?

42:19.220 --> 42:20.336
Pipa.

42:20.420 --> 42:22.980
I was, I think... I was.

42:23.940 --> 42:25.340
I was next to her.

42:27.260 --> 42:31.256
And during the ride she didn't...
she didn't tell you anything?

42:31.340 --> 42:32.416
No.

42:32.500 --> 42:33.820
We didn't talk.

42:34.420 --> 42:36.576
The music was too loud and...

42:36.660 --> 42:37.820
And I fell asleep.

42:42.540 --> 42:44.980
And what do you think happened after that?

42:45.940 --> 42:46.980
I don't know.

42:47.580 --> 42:48.660
Maybe...

42:50.180 --> 42:52.940
she left or she got distracted...

42:53.420 --> 42:55.100
or she got lost, I don't know.

42:58.300 --> 42:59.336
Sir?

42:59.420 --> 43:02.020
My name is Ramón, no need to be so formal.

43:04.380 --> 43:06.380
You're going to find her, right?

43:07.140 --> 43:08.340
Don't worry about it.

43:09.060 --> 43:10.220
I'll find her.

43:10.940 --> 43:12.460
Do you want to take a break?

43:17.660 --> 43:18.820
Yes.

43:18.940 --> 43:20.140
CORNELIA VILLALBA'S CASE

43:47.020 --> 43:48.656
14 YEARS SINCE CORNELIA VILLALBA'S
DISAPPEARANCE

43:48.740 --> 43:50.336
SCHOOL STATEMENT

43:50.420 --> 43:52.980
TUNIK VOLCANO ERUPTION

43:53.933 --> 43:55.496
14 YEARS SINCE VILLALBA'S DISAPPEARANCE

43:55.580 --> 43:58.416
VILLALBA CASE CLOSED

43:58.500 --> 44:00.456
VILLALBA, CORNELIA
HALF OF YOUR ABSENCE IS LOVE

44:00.540 --> 44:02.340
Don't leave without me.

44:03.060 --> 44:04.260
Wait for me.

44:35.100 --> 44:38.376
Forensics has some criminals
with tattoos registered.

44:38.460 --> 44:41.696
But they're the typical tattoos,
like the ones you get in jail.

44:41.780 --> 44:43.136
But this one is different.

44:43.220 --> 44:45.616
If he is archived,
it'll be easier to find him.

44:45.700 --> 44:46.820
Okay, look into it.

44:46.940 --> 44:48.140
It's important.

44:49.620 --> 44:51.980
The man in the church had one.

44:53.140 --> 44:54.336
Also that scarf.

44:54.420 --> 44:57.176
A woman at the church dropped it.

44:57.260 --> 44:59.060
The day of the mass.

45:00.340 --> 45:03.016
I know they're refining the search
by traits.

45:03.100 --> 45:05.100
Men, women.

45:06.220 --> 45:09.340
The obituary is a dead end,
it was paid in cash.

45:11.820 --> 45:12.696
In what agency?

45:12.780 --> 45:16.460
Recoleta. I talked to all the employees
and no one remembers who submitted it.

45:17.020 --> 45:17.936
And the photo?

45:18.020 --> 45:21.016
It's got a slight mark
on the left side corner. See?

45:21.100 --> 45:23.056
I think it could be a blemish on the lens.

45:23.140 --> 45:26.060
It's a fingerprint. If you find
the camera, we'll know who took it.

45:26.940 --> 45:28.700
We're going to go after the tattoos.

45:31.740 --> 45:34.500
Breaking into police archives
is a federal crime.

45:36.460 --> 45:38.220
It won't be the first time.

45:38.620 --> 45:40.976
Can you use my password? From here?

45:41.060 --> 45:43.256
I always end up doing the dirty work.

45:43.340 --> 45:44.220
Come on.

45:49.420 --> 45:50.820
You're not staying over for dinner?

45:50.940 --> 45:53.100
No, I have work to do.

46:06.220 --> 46:07.100
Alina?

46:08.460 --> 46:10.016
Talk to me, what happened?

46:10.100 --> 46:11.820
I found someone with the same tattoo.

46:12.580 --> 46:15.376
She got here four years ago
in a wretched state.

46:15.460 --> 46:18.216
She wouldn't talk,
no contact with the world.

46:18.300 --> 46:20.380
The nurses call her The Ghost.

46:20.963 --> 46:22.776
Oh, and she started painting a while ago.

46:22.860 --> 46:25.180
Those kinds of activities sometimes yield
positive results.

46:25.620 --> 46:28.016
They start to slowly let out
their inner scars

46:28.100 --> 46:30.260
caused by the violent events
they went through.

46:31.060 --> 46:33.820
Keep in mind she isn't used
to unknown faces.

46:33.940 --> 46:35.140
Any visits?

46:35.540 --> 46:37.976
Not that I know of,
but I can look it up.

46:38.060 --> 46:39.820
Could you look it up now?

46:41.420 --> 46:43.300
- Yes, of course.
- Thank you.

47:05.580 --> 47:07.736
- No.
- Relax.

47:07.820 --> 47:08.661
You have a visitor.

47:11.060 --> 47:13.016
- No!
- Relax.

47:13.100 --> 47:15.456
Come here, relax.

47:15.540 --> 47:17.656
Come on.

47:17.740 --> 47:19.220
There you go.

47:47.660 --> 47:49.100
Can I see your arm?

47:55.180 --> 47:56.180
May I?

48:06.340 --> 48:07.820
What does this tattoo mean?

48:10.020 --> 48:11.020
She doesn't talk.

48:11.540 --> 48:12.540
Don't waste your time.

48:24.220 --> 48:25.976
Why did you write "Cornelia"?

48:26.060 --> 48:27.740
Do you know Cornelia Villalba?

48:33.560 --> 48:34.423
Out!

48:35.140 --> 48:36.140
Leave, please.

48:38.380 --> 48:41.216
Relax, Ghosty.

48:41.300 --> 48:43.420
Come on.

48:44.420 --> 48:46.780
Relax.

48:47.700 --> 48:51.740
Relax, Ghosty.

48:52.500 --> 48:55.119
According to the files,
this should be Nadine Basset.

48:58.723 --> 49:00.203
But you can't see much.

49:00.820 --> 49:02.296
Isn't there another camera?

49:02.380 --> 49:04.336
No, this one was fixed last year.

49:04.420 --> 49:05.496
That's all there is.

49:05.580 --> 49:06.496
Yes, that's her.

49:06.580 --> 49:08.376
She always comes on the same date.

49:08.460 --> 49:10.456
And you're sure
she's the only one who visits her?

49:10.540 --> 49:13.440
In my time here,
I've never seen anyone else.

49:13.525 --> 49:14.776
She always comes on October 18.

49:14.860 --> 49:17.616
And if recall correctly,
she always comes at the same time.

49:17.700 --> 49:20.460
She brings a cake, they blow the candles,
and she leaves.

49:21.220 --> 49:23.656
I thought you didn't have any information
on The Ghost.

49:23.740 --> 49:25.496
How do you know it's her birthday?

49:25.580 --> 49:27.456
I meant the Spanish lady's birthday.

49:27.540 --> 49:29.376
- Is she a Spaniard?
- Yes.

49:29.460 --> 49:32.376
And do you know if they are relatives?

49:32.460 --> 49:33.620
Not that I know of.

49:35.380 --> 49:38.340
Okay, I'm going to take the files
and the security tapes.

49:38.940 --> 49:40.860
If she comes back to the Cudet, call me.

49:40.980 --> 49:44.380
October 18 is next week.
She'll come, she always does.

49:47.780 --> 49:50.256
I don't think we can build
a case out of this.

49:50.678 --> 49:53.388
She's the same person who was
at the church, the day of the mass.

49:53.700 --> 49:56.700
And the patient had a drawing
with "Cornelia" written on it.

49:57.420 --> 50:01.336
A crazy person's drawings aren't evidence.
You know that. We've got nothing.

50:01.420 --> 50:05.016
No, Ramón.
It can't be just a coincidence.

50:05.100 --> 50:07.060
Cornelia is not a common name.

50:07.620 --> 50:10.820
I'll keep looking till I find something.
We have to find Nadine Basset.

50:10.940 --> 50:13.776
Look, I'm not telling you what to do
with your free time, okay?

50:13.860 --> 50:16.056
If you want to play private detective,
go ahead.

50:16.140 --> 50:18.860
But I need you here, working.

50:19.660 --> 50:21.180
What happened with the therapist?

50:22.100 --> 50:24.336
Sorry to interrupt, but everyone's left

50:24.420 --> 50:27.536
and I'm still here filling out paperwork.
Maybe someone can help me out?

50:27.620 --> 50:31.820
Manuela will help you.
She seems to have plenty of free time.

51:37.380 --> 51:39.860
Good morning, my lovely mermaid.

51:40.500 --> 51:41.696
All good?

51:41.780 --> 51:44.216
Have you been there long?

51:44.300 --> 51:45.340
Long enough.

51:45.980 --> 51:47.176
And the Russians?

51:47.260 --> 51:48.696
Sleeping.

51:48.780 --> 51:49.820
And they're Albanians.

51:50.660 --> 51:53.016
And you know what I think of Albanians.

51:53.100 --> 51:56.056
I know what you think
of the Albanian mafia.

51:56.140 --> 51:57.136
These ones are friends.

51:57.220 --> 51:59.860
And no one knows
how to treat my friends like you,

51:59.980 --> 52:02.700
leave them with good memories
of Buenos Aires.

52:04.140 --> 52:05.980
Here's another 2,000 dollars.

52:09.940 --> 52:13.460
I heard that you and Adalberto
are dealing with something.

52:16.340 --> 52:18.416
Buying and selling women is a man's job,

52:18.500 --> 52:20.100
I've told you a thousand times.

52:20.660 --> 52:23.980
I don't know what you're talking about.
You have no reason to...

52:24.780 --> 52:26.260
It's personal business.

52:26.940 --> 52:29.540
Since when do you have personal business?

52:31.460 --> 52:35.056
When Adalberto brought you,
I agreed to have you deal with the girls.

52:35.140 --> 52:36.660
Don't make me regret it.

52:38.940 --> 52:39.980
Yes.

52:41.580 --> 52:43.136
My Mermaid.

52:43.220 --> 52:46.420
Personal business is over.

52:47.260 --> 52:48.980
Yes, my king.

53:17.220 --> 53:19.100
Here are the mental hospital's files.

53:21.140 --> 53:22.220
Did you find anything?

53:23.620 --> 53:26.176
No one named Nadine Basset
has entered the country.

53:26.260 --> 53:28.736
I'm still waiting on the information
from domestic flights

53:28.820 --> 53:31.300
because the airports don't keep a record.

53:35.020 --> 53:36.456
There's got to be something.

53:36.540 --> 53:41.820
No photos, no social media,
no bank account, no credit card, it's...

53:41.940 --> 53:42.940
just a name.

53:46.100 --> 53:47.060
Come here, Ramón.

53:48.386 --> 53:49.416
Have you seen Ramón?

53:49.500 --> 53:51.336
No, I haven't.

53:51.420 --> 53:54.336
Then what is it? A fake identity?

53:54.420 --> 53:57.180
I'm almost sure of it.
But I found something else.

53:57.980 --> 53:59.616
You told me she was from Spain.

53:59.700 --> 54:02.336
- Yes.
- I found a town near Africa.

54:02.420 --> 54:04.940
In the Canaries, a fishing town. Look.

54:06.180 --> 54:07.056
Another mermaid.

54:07.140 --> 54:10.056
Yes. A motif that repeats itself
in various vessels.

54:10.140 --> 54:12.780
Represents the fishermen's
good and bad fortune.

54:13.420 --> 54:15.376
The two-headed mermaid.

54:15.460 --> 54:17.820
The same one from the scarf
and the tattoos.

54:19.460 --> 54:21.696
We have to wait
for the airline information.

54:21.780 --> 54:23.500
I need to find her on the map.

54:24.500 --> 54:26.256
I'm on it. I'll have it done by today.

54:26.340 --> 54:29.140
Give me the mental hospital's files,
please.

54:32.100 --> 54:35.660
I want to know on what days she visited
her, or if she had any other visitors.

54:36.540 --> 54:37.740
I want to know everything.

54:38.940 --> 54:40.620
I need to be one step ahead.

54:42.540 --> 54:45.660
If I find Nadine Basset,
I'll know what happened to Cornelia.

54:47.140 --> 54:49.456
The DA's office
doesn't like to re-open cases.

54:49.540 --> 54:51.740
And isn't your police chief
about to get a promotion?

54:54.500 --> 54:56.220
Did you leave the window open?

54:57.820 --> 55:00.536
My cat's going to run away, Alina. Ramón!

55:00.620 --> 55:01.700
Ramón!

55:09.020 --> 55:10.700
Ramón! Come here!

55:11.180 --> 55:12.380
Come here! Go on!

55:17.260 --> 55:19.780
I found another obituary
that you might be interested in.

55:40.820 --> 55:42.336
VILLALBA CORNELIA
ONE YEAR OF LOVE

55:42.420 --> 55:43.540
Ramón?

55:48.060 --> 55:49.660
Ramón?

57:02.844 --> 57:03.970
Pipa!

57:05.820 --> 57:06.860
No!

57:21.020 --> 57:23.420
Ramón!

57:49.460 --> 57:51.020
Bitch.

57:56.020 --> 57:57.580
Ramón! Come here!

58:05.580 --> 58:06.660
Alina!

58:07.420 --> 58:08.296
Alina!

58:08.380 --> 58:11.176
No, Alina.

58:11.602 --> 58:12.722
Alina...

58:38.420 --> 58:39.300
Hey.

58:40.260 --> 58:41.176
Manuela Pelari?

58:41.260 --> 58:42.726
We haven't been able to talk to her.

58:42.811 --> 58:44.788
She hasn't moved since we got here.
She won't talk.

58:44.873 --> 58:47.296
You know Manuela,
there's too many people here.

58:47.380 --> 58:49.176
- We were waiting for you.
- What happened?

58:49.260 --> 58:50.256
We're not certain.

58:50.340 --> 58:52.736
A woman jumped out the window,
but no one saw anything.

58:52.820 --> 58:55.296
We will need the detective's statement.

58:55.380 --> 58:57.620
Apparently, she's the only witness so far.

58:58.380 --> 58:59.380
Got a smoke?

59:03.020 --> 59:04.180
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

59:06.340 --> 59:07.860
When did Forensics get here?

59:07.980 --> 59:09.460
About an hour ago.

59:12.420 --> 59:13.620
Call Gerez.

59:24.512 --> 59:25.992
Pipa, tell me what happened.

59:27.380 --> 59:29.060
I know she was like a sister to you.

59:31.140 --> 59:31.981
I want to help you.

59:37.380 --> 59:38.736
She was killed because of me.

59:38.820 --> 59:40.336
Who killed her? Did you see him?

59:40.420 --> 59:41.940
The guy with the tattoo.

59:43.740 --> 59:46.616
Pipa, I promise we're going to do
everything we can to...

59:46.700 --> 59:49.576
- Like you did with Cornelia?
- This has nothing to do with Cornelia!

59:49.660 --> 59:53.100
This has everything to do with Cornelia,
with you and with the force!

59:53.860 --> 59:55.940
If you'd listened to me,
Alina would be alive.

59:56.660 --> 59:59.696
What are you going to tell me now?
That she slipped?

59:59.780 --> 01:00:01.616
That she fell down?

01:00:01.700 --> 01:00:03.336
She was killed.

01:00:03.420 --> 01:00:05.820
She was killed by the same people
that killed Cornelia.

01:00:05.940 --> 01:00:09.420
And you closed the case 14 years ago
like you'll close this one too.

01:00:10.540 --> 01:00:12.176
No one gives a crap.

01:00:12.260 --> 01:00:13.496
Relax, please.

01:00:13.580 --> 01:00:15.020
I'm not going to fucking relax!

01:00:16.580 --> 01:00:19.656
The Spanish woman, Nadine Basset,
went to the church on the day of the mass.

01:00:19.740 --> 01:00:21.136
She went because of Cornelia.

01:00:21.220 --> 01:00:23.100
They know I'm close.

01:00:23.620 --> 01:00:24.940
I won't stop until I find her.

01:00:25.620 --> 01:00:27.256
Let me investigate.

01:00:27.340 --> 01:00:28.656
You know you can't.

01:00:28.740 --> 01:00:31.100
- The girl jumped from your house.
- She jumped?

01:00:32.100 --> 01:00:33.176
She was pushed.

01:00:33.260 --> 01:00:34.740
And where were you?

01:00:35.460 --> 01:00:36.660
Looking for my cat.

01:00:42.820 --> 01:00:46.216
Pipa, this has gone too far.
You can't get involved.

01:00:46.300 --> 01:00:49.820
- The press will say it's personal.
- You know what the press will say?

01:00:49.940 --> 01:00:52.500
That the Police are useless.

01:00:53.500 --> 01:00:54.736
My friend was killed.

01:00:54.820 --> 01:00:57.056
And I'm going to find out who did it.

01:00:57.140 --> 01:00:58.300
With or without your help.

01:00:59.700 --> 01:01:00.860
Are you threatening me?

01:01:00.980 --> 01:01:02.060
I'm letting you know.

01:01:04.260 --> 01:01:05.260
You leave me no choice.

01:01:06.340 --> 01:01:09.176
You're suspended
until this whole thing is solved.

01:01:09.260 --> 01:01:11.340
You're in no condition to continue.

01:01:13.060 --> 01:01:16.580
You'll have to give me your gun and badge,
and leave as soon as possible.

01:01:24.292 --> 01:01:27.632
NAME OF PASSENGER
ARRIVALS - DEPARTURES

01:02:03.700 --> 01:02:06.580
You were right, chief.
She just took a flight heading south.

01:02:09.180 --> 01:02:10.660
That bitch...

01:02:11.580 --> 01:02:13.576
We won't notify the Police there, will we?

01:02:13.660 --> 01:02:16.376
No. If someone covered it up
like Pipa thinks,

01:02:16.460 --> 01:02:18.460
then they're all in on it.

01:02:19.060 --> 01:02:21.376
Should I get cleared
to fly there right now?

01:02:21.460 --> 01:02:23.136
No, I'll deal with Pipa.

01:02:23.220 --> 01:02:25.936
Work with Homicide to find Alina's killer.

01:02:26.020 --> 01:02:26.918
Go.

01:02:29.340 --> 01:02:30.500
Martín.

01:02:31.460 --> 01:02:33.500
Don't talk with anyone
until we're certain.

01:02:36.140 --> 01:02:39.736
I regret the day you convinced me
that I needed this bitch!

01:02:39.820 --> 01:02:41.616
To deal with the business.

01:02:41.700 --> 01:02:44.696
It's my fault.
I decided to murder her.

01:02:44.780 --> 01:02:45.976
That woman knew too much.

01:02:46.060 --> 01:02:50.936
Yeah? Is that how you deal with things?
By killing an informant in a cop's house?

01:02:51.020 --> 01:02:53.016
Why do you think I run the business?

01:02:53.100 --> 01:02:53.976
Why?

01:02:54.060 --> 01:02:55.776
- The cop has nothing.
- She doesn't?

01:02:55.860 --> 01:02:57.100
- No.
- She has nothing?

01:02:58.020 --> 01:02:58.861
She has nothing?

01:03:01.180 --> 01:03:03.376
Then why is she in the south right now?

01:03:03.460 --> 01:03:05.936
I always find out, Mermaid!

01:03:06.020 --> 01:03:09.100
Ten years under the radar,
and now they're onto me because of you!

01:03:09.980 --> 01:03:13.216
And you! You ruined everything
because of a fucking whore!

01:03:13.300 --> 01:03:15.616
You and I will talk. Now get out.

01:03:15.700 --> 01:03:17.460
Get out and watch the door.

01:03:22.300 --> 01:03:26.780
A woman's secrets and lies
are more important than her own life!

01:03:36.020 --> 01:03:37.780
I'm going to fix this my own way.

01:03:38.700 --> 01:03:39.541
My king.

01:03:41.620 --> 01:03:42.656
I give you my word.

01:03:42.740 --> 01:03:46.540
Your word is worthless.
I have no use for you anymore.

01:04:16.020 --> 01:04:17.220
It's over, Mermaid.

01:04:17.780 --> 01:04:18.660
Mermaid!

01:04:19.260 --> 01:04:20.180
Let's go!

01:04:21.940 --> 01:04:23.140
No, you go.

01:04:24.380 --> 01:04:26.180
I'm not leaving until you're safe.

01:04:29.660 --> 01:04:31.380
I was never safe.

01:05:31.260 --> 01:05:32.740
I brought you more hot tea.

01:05:34.020 --> 01:05:35.660
So the case has been reopened?

01:05:37.020 --> 01:05:37.936
Yes.

01:05:38.020 --> 01:05:39.460
It was a tragedy.

01:05:40.140 --> 01:05:41.860
To think they stopped looking for her!

01:05:42.740 --> 01:05:45.540
Some places around here still have ashes.

01:05:47.380 --> 01:05:49.340
If you need anything else, ask me.

01:05:52.860 --> 01:05:54.420
I'm looking for this woman.

01:05:55.020 --> 01:05:57.940
She's always with a man
who has this tattoo.

01:06:00.020 --> 01:06:01.300
She's a Spaniard.

01:06:02.660 --> 01:06:03.820
No, I don't know her.

01:06:04.940 --> 01:06:07.820
I don't know, she could be a client,
a lot of people come here.

01:06:09.180 --> 01:06:11.580
And if I'd seen this tattoo,
I'd remember.

01:06:14.340 --> 01:06:17.016
I'd like to go to the spot
the necklace was found.

01:06:17.100 --> 01:06:19.540
Of course. Ariel will be here soon.
He can take you.

01:06:21.820 --> 01:06:23.660
Can I see the guest book right now?

01:06:25.100 --> 01:06:26.260
I'll bring it right over.

01:06:27.060 --> 01:06:28.220
Her name is Nadine Basset.

01:07:31.060 --> 01:07:32.376
Seretti, from Trafficking.

01:07:32.460 --> 01:07:34.456
- Coria, Homicide.
- Nice to meet you.

01:07:34.540 --> 01:07:35.936
We were waiting for you.

01:07:36.020 --> 01:07:37.820
Are you sure he's the Egyptian?

01:07:37.940 --> 01:07:41.216
Khalfani Sadat.
We checked everything on him.

01:07:41.300 --> 01:07:45.460
He's been wanted for over ten years,
he's a big fish, that's why we called you.

01:07:46.420 --> 01:07:47.776
Do we know when he was killed?

01:07:47.860 --> 01:07:50.976
A couple of hours ago,
Forensics will confirm it in a while.

01:07:51.060 --> 01:07:52.060
Murder weapon?

01:07:52.940 --> 01:07:56.260
A piercing object.
But it still hasn't been found.

01:07:58.113 --> 01:07:58.976
Okay.

01:07:59.060 --> 01:08:01.340
- Excuse me.
- Go ahead.

01:08:01.425 --> 01:08:03.662
FORENSICS

01:08:25.572 --> 01:08:26.678
NADINE AND K.

01:08:35.220 --> 01:08:36.380
Here it is.

01:09:42.660 --> 01:09:43.979
Don't leave without me.

01:10:00.780 --> 01:10:01.940
It was you.

01:10:03.260 --> 01:10:04.420
You drugged us!

01:10:08.260 --> 01:10:09.536
What did you do to Cornelia?

01:10:09.620 --> 01:10:10.780
Why the fuck do you care?

01:10:11.980 --> 01:10:12.821
Worry about yourself.

01:10:29.140 --> 01:10:29.981
Hello.

01:10:33.420 --> 01:10:35.020
Okay, understood.

01:10:48.580 --> 01:10:49.860
It's still not your turn. Let's go.

01:11:16.060 --> 01:11:16.901
Mom?

01:11:33.940 --> 01:11:35.020
Mom?

01:11:54.860 --> 01:11:55.701
Mom!

01:11:56.620 --> 01:11:59.060
Mom! Mom!

01:11:59.820 --> 01:12:00.661
Mom!

01:12:01.620 --> 01:12:03.420
Mom!

01:12:04.740 --> 01:12:05.860
No!

01:12:15.980 --> 01:12:16.980
Hello, Pipa.

01:12:30.140 --> 01:12:31.300
You found me.

01:12:33.580 --> 01:12:35.340
Or rather, I found you.

01:12:37.340 --> 01:12:38.300
Cornelia.

01:12:39.620 --> 01:12:40.580
You're alive.

01:12:41.860 --> 01:12:43.980
Yes, well, that's one way to put it.

01:12:44.860 --> 01:12:46.780
But I haven't been Cornelia
for the longest time.

01:12:47.340 --> 01:12:49.416
Precisely since you abandoned me here.

01:12:49.500 --> 01:12:50.341
What?

01:12:53.940 --> 01:12:57.380
Pipa, you were my best friend.
You were more than that.

01:12:58.260 --> 01:12:59.340
You were like my sister.

01:13:00.940 --> 01:13:02.060
I trusted you.

01:13:04.180 --> 01:13:05.340
And you left.

01:13:08.140 --> 01:13:09.936
But that wasn't the worst part.

01:13:10.020 --> 01:13:10.861
No.

01:13:11.820 --> 01:13:14.176
The worst was all of you
moving on with your lives

01:13:14.260 --> 01:13:15.500
as if nothing had happened.

01:13:16.580 --> 01:13:18.620
So I did what you all wanted me to do.

01:13:20.540 --> 01:13:22.620
- I stopped existing.
- I didn't leave you.

01:13:24.820 --> 01:13:26.780
My life also changed after that night.

01:13:29.740 --> 01:13:30.656
Pipa...

01:13:30.740 --> 01:13:31.980
did you suffer?

01:13:33.860 --> 01:13:36.340
And I thought I had gotten the worst part.

01:13:38.620 --> 01:13:40.980
You left me to be a slave.

01:13:42.660 --> 01:13:43.940
A whore.

01:13:46.992 --> 01:13:48.061
Nadine.

01:13:51.340 --> 01:13:53.980
No, I'd rather you called me Mermaid.

01:13:57.340 --> 01:14:01.300
At first, it angered me
that you should start digging up the past.

01:14:02.940 --> 01:14:06.780
But now I feel flattered
that you searched for me so diligently.

01:14:08.140 --> 01:14:10.020
It was a bit late, don't you think?

01:14:11.180 --> 01:14:14.740
Well. Now that you're here,
I'll tell you what happened.

01:14:16.220 --> 01:14:19.180
That's why I've come here personally.

01:15:02.420 --> 01:15:03.420
Mica...

01:15:06.020 --> 01:15:07.020
Hey, Mica.

01:15:12.980 --> 01:15:14.020
Pipa.

01:15:15.260 --> 01:15:16.460
I'm sleepy.

01:15:17.540 --> 01:15:20.420
I'll be right back.
Don't leave without me.

01:16:00.460 --> 01:16:01.380
Leo?

01:16:04.140 --> 01:16:05.180
We're leaving.

01:16:05.866 --> 01:16:06.940
Leo.

01:16:09.740 --> 01:16:10.700
Leo.

01:16:31.740 --> 01:16:32.860
You fucking cunt!

01:16:32.980 --> 01:16:34.323
- No!
- What the fuck are you doing?

01:16:34.408 --> 01:16:35.376
Get off!

01:16:35.460 --> 01:16:36.460
Leonora?

01:16:40.100 --> 01:16:41.056
She never said a thing.

01:16:41.140 --> 01:16:43.140
They told her if she said anything,
they'd kill me.

01:16:51.060 --> 01:16:52.456
Let us go, please.

01:16:52.540 --> 01:16:54.376
It's over, bitch, it's over. You lost.

01:16:54.460 --> 01:16:55.620
You'll never get out of here.

01:16:57.860 --> 01:17:00.016
Leonora also stopped being Leonora.

01:17:00.100 --> 01:17:02.216
The only difference is
she wasn't a virgin anymore.

01:17:02.300 --> 01:17:04.016
That's why they took me.

01:17:04.100 --> 01:17:06.940
Do you know how much people
will pay for a virgin?

01:17:11.260 --> 01:17:13.096
<i>At first, they give you gifts.</i>

01:17:13.180 --> 01:17:14.100
<i>They treat you well.</i>

01:17:16.300 --> 01:17:18.740
<i>But then you're cheap goods,
just another whore.</i>

01:17:20.740 --> 01:17:22.616
<i>But eventually,</i>

01:17:22.700 --> 01:17:24.580
<i>after many years, I got lucky.</i>

01:17:26.260 --> 01:17:27.620
<i>They killed me again.</i>

01:18:06.140 --> 01:18:07.420
<i>And I returned to Argentina.</i>

01:18:32.020 --> 01:18:34.216
When I returned,
I went to see Leonora.

01:18:34.300 --> 01:18:37.780
And I gave her that stupid photo
she wrongly decided to use at the mass.

01:18:38.460 --> 01:18:41.500
You didn't think I'd realize
you weren't wearing the necklace, right?

01:18:42.380 --> 01:18:44.500
That's why you wanted the photo back.

01:18:45.660 --> 01:18:46.740
Cornelia.

01:18:50.860 --> 01:18:52.496
Why didn't you look for me?

01:18:52.580 --> 01:18:53.940
You don't understand yet.

01:18:55.420 --> 01:18:57.820
I stopped being Cornelia
when I became a slave.

01:18:59.100 --> 01:19:01.420
Leonora was the only person
who could understand me.

01:19:02.620 --> 01:19:03.736
And who owes me something.

01:19:03.820 --> 01:19:07.820
If there's someone from my past
that still has a relationship with me,

01:19:07.940 --> 01:19:08.781
it's her.

01:19:09.740 --> 01:19:11.100
But no, of course.

01:19:12.100 --> 01:19:13.860
You had to go and start searching again.

01:19:13.980 --> 01:19:16.136
I never stopped looking for you.

01:19:16.220 --> 01:19:17.656
Nor did your family.

01:19:17.740 --> 01:19:20.620
My only family is a ghost
in a mental hospital.

01:19:22.860 --> 01:19:24.140
Don't cry, Pipa.

01:19:25.180 --> 01:19:26.860
Don't cry for me.

01:19:27.980 --> 01:19:29.220
I'm not worth it.

01:19:42.020 --> 01:19:43.940
Nothing is forever, Pipa.

01:19:44.860 --> 01:19:45.820
You know that.

01:19:48.220 --> 01:19:49.980
Only while you're still naive.

01:19:58.620 --> 01:20:00.260
And neither of us is.

01:21:04.380 --> 01:21:06.136
The cops are looking for me.

01:21:06.220 --> 01:21:07.660
They know I'm here.

01:21:09.220 --> 01:21:10.300
Of course they do.

01:21:11.540 --> 01:21:13.300
How else do you think this works?

01:21:13.980 --> 01:21:15.420
No one's gonna save you.

01:22:59.340 --> 01:23:00.820
Tell me where she is.

01:23:00.940 --> 01:23:01.940
Pipa!

01:23:04.420 --> 01:23:05.420
Ramón?

01:23:07.540 --> 01:23:09.220
I'm here, Ramón!

01:23:17.860 --> 01:23:21.620
The Egyptian is dead.
It's over. Tell me where she is.

01:23:23.060 --> 01:23:24.100
What Egyptian?

01:23:26.020 --> 01:23:27.820
You'll never find out.

01:23:28.318 --> 01:23:29.501
No!

01:23:35.580 --> 01:23:38.220
Cornelia's alive! She's here!

01:23:39.340 --> 01:23:40.496
She's Nadine.

01:23:40.580 --> 01:23:41.620
Stay here!

01:24:11.940 --> 01:24:12.860
Pipa.

01:24:17.620 --> 01:24:18.980
Is there anyone else here?

01:24:19.780 --> 01:24:22.136
Pipa, answer me! Is Oreyana here?

01:24:22.220 --> 01:24:23.776
Why, Martin? What happened?

01:24:23.860 --> 01:24:25.216
Is Oreyana here or not?

01:24:25.300 --> 01:24:26.936
- Yes.
- Where is he?

01:24:27.020 --> 01:24:28.340
He went to look for Nadine.

01:24:31.660 --> 01:24:33.296
Let's go. We need to go.

01:24:33.380 --> 01:24:35.020
Come on, Pipa, snap out of it.

01:24:36.460 --> 01:24:37.580
Are you okay?

01:24:38.380 --> 01:24:39.221
Let's go.

01:25:02.540 --> 01:25:03.696
Pipa, it's me.

01:25:03.780 --> 01:25:04.820
Ramón?

01:25:05.980 --> 01:25:07.766
What did you do, have you gone mad?

01:25:07.851 --> 01:25:09.628
Listen carefully
to what I'm about to tell you.

01:25:09.713 --> 01:25:11.936
I need to find the Mermaid.

01:25:12.020 --> 01:25:14.536
- She can't get away again!
- What?

01:25:14.620 --> 01:25:17.656
Think, Pipa, you have to think fast.

01:25:17.740 --> 01:25:20.100
Think of the best way
out of here for both of us.

01:25:21.100 --> 01:25:23.936
What way out are you talking about
if you killed Seretti?

01:25:24.020 --> 01:25:27.620
He should have stayed out of it.
So should Alina.

01:25:29.060 --> 01:25:30.740
But it's different between us!

01:25:33.220 --> 01:25:34.936
Pipa, I'm going there, don't shoot.

01:25:35.020 --> 01:25:36.180
No, don't come!

01:25:37.180 --> 01:25:38.100
Relax!

01:25:51.940 --> 01:25:54.140
You promised you'd take care of us.

01:25:57.300 --> 01:25:59.140
And you let them take her!

01:26:02.740 --> 01:26:04.860
I trusted you, Ramón!

01:26:04.980 --> 01:26:07.540
I taught you not to trust anyone.

01:26:08.340 --> 01:26:10.140
Turn yourself in.

01:26:10.660 --> 01:26:11.620
You know I won't.

01:26:13.180 --> 01:26:15.740
This is absurd.
We're going to end up killing each other.

01:26:43.460 --> 01:26:45.256
You ruined my life.

01:26:45.340 --> 01:26:46.181
No.

01:26:46.740 --> 01:26:48.060
I was taking care of you.

01:26:53.020 --> 01:26:54.336
You're a monster.

01:26:54.420 --> 01:26:57.174
Pipa, I didn't do what I wanted to,
I did what I could.

01:26:57.700 --> 01:27:00.660
One thing led to another.
When I wanted to get out, it was too late.

01:27:03.220 --> 01:27:05.500
But I'm the only family you have.

01:27:08.140 --> 01:27:09.980
And you're the daughter I never had.

01:27:11.460 --> 01:27:14.340
You're getting it all wrong.
This is business.

01:27:15.780 --> 01:27:17.060
It's nothing personal.

01:27:33.220 --> 01:27:34.220
It is to me.

01:27:55.780 --> 01:27:56.860
Pipa...

01:28:50.780 --> 01:28:51.780
Let's go.

01:28:55.100 --> 01:28:57.936
We're going out for dinner and drinks.

01:28:58.020 --> 01:28:59.300
Want to join us?

01:29:00.958 --> 01:29:01.998
I'll be right there.

01:29:10.820 --> 01:29:12.100
Thank you for coming.

01:29:14.380 --> 01:29:16.740
I wanted to return her things
to you personally.

01:29:19.220 --> 01:29:21.020
I knew you'd find her.

01:29:23.060 --> 01:29:25.020
Now I'll be able to bury her.

01:29:25.580 --> 01:29:29.936
I'm glad it's you who gave an end
to this story.

01:29:30.020 --> 01:29:31.780
Cornelia is dead.

01:29:33.820 --> 01:29:35.300
And so are the people who killed her.

01:29:48.660 --> 01:29:49.740
Thank you.

01:29:51.420 --> 01:29:52.540
Thank you.

01:30:25.927 --> 01:30:26.776
Hi.

01:30:26.860 --> 01:30:27.980
What are you doing here?

01:30:29.340 --> 01:30:32.100
I'm doing much better.
It barely hurts anymore.

01:30:33.620 --> 01:30:35.300
Come in, Seretti.

01:30:52.300 --> 01:30:53.700
We need more people like you.

01:30:56.060 --> 01:30:56.901
Thanks.

01:31:04.420 --> 01:31:06.540
The entire police force
is looking for Nadine Basset.

01:31:08.860 --> 01:31:10.780
I don't think she'll last long
on the streets.

01:31:17.660 --> 01:31:18.936
You were very pretty.

01:31:19.020 --> 01:31:20.100
That's not me.

01:31:22.260 --> 01:31:23.101
Sorry.

01:31:24.300 --> 01:31:26.616
The Cudet is under surveillance, so...

01:31:26.700 --> 01:31:28.420
- If...
- But thanks anyways.

01:31:30.620 --> 01:31:31.461
You're welcome.

01:31:32.100 --> 01:31:34.260
If she shows up, we'll catch her.

01:31:34.688 --> 01:31:37.203
She's the only one who can tell us
what happened to Cornelia.

01:31:37.288 --> 01:31:38.494
She won't return to the Cudet.

01:31:39.780 --> 01:31:41.496
She knows we've found The Ghost.

01:31:41.580 --> 01:31:42.980
Well, it's a possibility.

01:31:44.380 --> 01:31:45.536
Today's October 18.

01:31:45.620 --> 01:31:47.496
If it's not today,
it's tomorrow, or next year.

01:31:47.580 --> 01:31:50.180
Maybe. But I don't think so.

01:31:51.860 --> 01:31:53.656
That was Clara Villalba yesterday, right?

01:31:53.740 --> 01:31:54.581
Yes.

01:31:56.020 --> 01:31:58.700
I called her to tell her we're not going
to get her body back.

01:31:59.820 --> 01:32:01.340
And that Ariel confessed.

01:32:04.460 --> 01:32:05.540
And Ariel is dead.

01:32:07.740 --> 01:32:08.581
Yes.

01:32:10.060 --> 01:32:11.580
But he told me.

01:32:18.380 --> 01:32:22.380
14 YEARS SINCE CORNELIA VILLALBA'S
DISAPPEARANCE

01:32:26.140 --> 01:32:27.300
WHOSE BIRTHDAY? 10/18

01:32:37.980 --> 01:32:41.100
VILLALBA, CORNELIA
HALF OF YOUR ABSENCE IS LOVE

01:32:41.660 --> 01:32:42.660
Seven...

01:32:47.540 --> 01:32:48.860
The half is seven.

01:32:48.980 --> 01:32:50.820
Pipa? Pipa...

01:32:51.380 --> 01:32:53.780
I forgot I had a birthday party.
Take care of my cat.

01:33:16.180 --> 01:33:18.456
Pipa. I wasn't expecting you.

01:33:18.540 --> 01:33:19.540
Can we talk?

01:33:20.340 --> 01:33:22.576
It's Rodrigo's birthday,
and I'm entertaining.

01:33:22.660 --> 01:33:23.780
I saw Cornelia.

01:33:25.700 --> 01:33:26.860
You have to leave.

01:33:26.980 --> 01:33:28.260
She told me everything.

01:33:35.500 --> 01:33:37.340
I know you placed the photo.

01:33:39.133 --> 01:33:41.256
She gave it to you
when she came back to Buenos Aires.

01:33:41.340 --> 01:33:43.300
And you also submitted the obituaries.

01:33:44.020 --> 01:33:47.420
You submitted the first one in 2011.
"One year of love."

01:33:48.780 --> 01:33:51.696
And the second one six years later.
The day of the mass.

01:33:51.780 --> 01:33:53.420
"The half of your absence is love."

01:33:56.180 --> 01:33:57.540
That's seven years.

01:33:59.020 --> 01:34:00.420
Rodrigo's age.

01:34:02.420 --> 01:34:03.940
And today's October 18.

01:34:05.220 --> 01:34:06.260
His birthday.

01:34:10.180 --> 01:34:13.660
When Cornelia showed up
with a baby...

01:34:14.660 --> 01:34:17.260
After everything that happened.
Everything they did to her.

01:34:18.620 --> 01:34:20.060
She couldn't take care of him.

01:34:21.060 --> 01:34:22.016
And I owed it to her.

01:34:22.100 --> 01:34:23.296
It wasn't your fault.

01:34:23.380 --> 01:34:24.260
Yes.

01:34:25.660 --> 01:34:27.180
They took her because of me.

01:34:27.820 --> 01:34:29.296
They threatened me.

01:34:29.380 --> 01:34:31.536
They told me if I said anything
they'd kill her.

01:34:31.620 --> 01:34:33.576
You don't know what they're capable of.

01:34:33.660 --> 01:34:35.260
Pipa, please.

01:34:35.980 --> 01:34:37.820
If they ever find out that Rodrigo
is hers...

01:34:39.500 --> 01:34:40.940
He's safe with me.

01:34:42.660 --> 01:34:44.580
You can't take him from me.

01:34:45.500 --> 01:34:47.020
He's my son.

01:34:51.300 --> 01:34:53.580
Come on, I killed you.
You're supposed to die.

01:35:54.300 --> 01:35:57.620
If you think I'm going to turn myself in,
you're very wrong.

01:35:59.740 --> 01:36:00.820
I didn't come for that.

01:36:04.500 --> 01:36:06.380
Our story ends here.

01:36:11.020 --> 01:36:12.340
You were right.

01:36:16.460 --> 01:36:17.540
Cornelia is dead.
