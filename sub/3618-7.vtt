WEBVTT

00:04.425 --> 00:07.467
Looks like they're all asleep.
Maybe I should sneak out of here.

00:07.768 --> 00:11.049
No. Why don't you stay for breakfast.

00:11.818 --> 00:13.539
How do you like your eggs?

00:13.824 --> 00:16.387
- What about your sisters?
- What about them?

00:17.667 --> 00:18.897
Whoa!

00:20.508 --> 00:22.628
Sorry. You okay?

00:23.308 --> 00:26.304
- What are you doing?
- Trying to fix the garbage disposal.

00:26.606 --> 00:29.568
- What are you doing?
- Messing around.

00:31.577 --> 00:33.889
Hey, sorry. I should have told you
I was here.

00:34.208 --> 00:38.845
No, don't be silly. Paige is a big girl.
She can hang out all she wants to.

00:39.262 --> 00:41.256
Not that she does a lot. I mean...

00:41.559 --> 00:43.518
- You can stop now.
- Right.

00:43.815 --> 00:45.456
Hey, you mind if I take a look?

00:46.030 --> 00:47.351
Sure, go ahead.

00:48.077 --> 00:49.671
Okay.

00:53.423 --> 00:55.097
What's wrong with the disposal
anyway?

00:55.345 --> 00:57.782
Not disposing, washer not washing.
Cable not cabling.

00:58.060 --> 01:00.657
- Don't forget the sink upstairs.
- It's next on my list.

01:00.985 --> 01:04.062
- Sounds like fun.
- That's my life, actually. All about fun.

01:10.968 --> 01:14.283
- There you go. It's as good as new.
- He's handy to have around.

01:14.600 --> 01:16.959
Yeah. I thought you didn't use
magic anymore.

01:17.274 --> 01:20.715
Just once in a while, for little things.
Want me to fix the washer?

01:21.075 --> 01:22.396
- Yes.
- No.

01:22.620 --> 01:24.933
Can you guys help me pick out
some earrings?

01:26.381 --> 01:28.420
Hi. I didn't know you were here.

01:29.094 --> 01:31.692
Hey, yeah. We got in late last night.

01:32.353 --> 01:34.711
- I see.
- He fixed the garbage disposal.

01:35.028 --> 01:37.022
- Really?
- Magically.

01:38.035 --> 01:39.596
Really?

01:43.422 --> 01:45.576
Can you help me with my earrings
out here, please?

01:46.723 --> 01:48.044
Sure.

01:49.355 --> 01:51.189
Excuse me.

01:53.155 --> 01:56.391
So how do you like your eggs,
scrambled or over easy?

01:57.626 --> 02:00.303
Okay, listen, was that weird?

02:00.591 --> 02:01.946
Why are you so dressed up?

02:02.178 --> 02:04.696
Because I have a date with Jason,
but that's besides the point.

02:05.019 --> 02:07.981
Didn't Richard lose it the last time
he used magic? I mean, really lose it?

02:08.317 --> 02:10.835
I can assure you that he stayed
in complete control

02:11.117 --> 02:12.791
over the garbage disposal.

02:13.665 --> 02:15.624
It's 7:00 in the morning,
how can you have a date?

02:15.879 --> 02:17.998
Because it's 7 here,
but it's evening in Hong Kong.

02:18.635 --> 02:21.233
Okay, so you're not concerned
about Richard using magic?

02:21.559 --> 02:25.160
Yeah, I am, but I'm more concerned
with Paige being really pissed off

02:25.486 --> 02:27.480
because we butted into
her business again.

02:27.742 --> 02:30.306
Yeah, I know, but we're sisters,
that's what we're supposed to do.

02:30.581 --> 02:34.261
Back to your date, I don't understand,
is Chris orbing you to Hong Kong?

02:34.634 --> 02:35.910
No, we're video conferencing.

02:36.138 --> 02:38.861
We just open our laptops
and there we are, in colour.

02:39.480 --> 02:40.801
In each other's laps.

02:41.067 --> 02:43.380
So do you think we should
talk to Paige about Richard?

02:43.697 --> 02:46.454
- We don't really know him.
- I know we don't.

02:46.747 --> 02:48.581
And neither does she.
That's the problem.

02:50.382 --> 02:53.618
- What, can't I worry?
- From afar. Yeah.

02:54.100 --> 02:57.256
Now, excuse me,
I have to go unclog a sink.

03:07.590 --> 03:10.347
Well, maybe a little magic
couldn't hurt.

03:19.872 --> 03:21.672
Help me!

03:32.446 --> 03:34.884
Okay, so watery lady
pops up from the sink.

03:35.159 --> 03:38.315
- You sure she's not a demon?
- I'm sure she needed help.

03:38.669 --> 03:40.264
- What else did she say?
- That was it.

03:40.507 --> 03:42.262
"Harding Park, pond,"
and poof!

03:47.232 --> 03:48.633
Over there.

04:06.530 --> 04:09.207
They're coming! Take this,
it does not belong to them!

04:45.293 --> 04:46.967
I'm liking these odds.

04:51.475 --> 04:52.830
Wuss.

04:53.773 --> 04:54.923
The sword.

04:56.530 --> 04:58.443
The sword is...

05:00.956 --> 05:03.554
Where'd she go?
What did she say?

05:03.881 --> 05:06.957
She said something about the sword.
Where is it?

05:07.558 --> 05:09.517
It's in the stone.

05:16.078 --> 05:18.117
The sword in the stone?

05:18.417 --> 05:21.573
Oh, you gotta be kidding me, right?

07:08.734 --> 07:10.693
Okay, could you maybe
miss the table?

07:10.949 --> 07:13.706
I'm sorry, I've never orbed anything
that heavy before.

07:13.998 --> 07:17.074
- Or that historic.
- Is that glowing?

07:17.382 --> 07:19.980
No, it's the sunroom,
there's a lot of light.

07:20.304 --> 07:22.776
What part of this aren't you getting?
Sword, stone, lady in lake.

07:23.102 --> 07:24.332
It was a pond.

07:25.568 --> 07:28.370
- You think she's from Avalon?
- Yeah, I think she was flushed out

07:28.660 --> 07:31.656
by whoever's after Excalibur.
The maker of kings.

07:31.960 --> 07:35.845
Look, we're not talking about Camelot,
right, because that's not real.

07:36.220 --> 07:38.943
You never believed in King Arthur
and the Knights of the Round Table?

07:39.270 --> 07:42.631
Yes, I did, when I was 7.
And then I grew up.

07:43.196 --> 07:45.634
Yeah, you grew up to be a witch

07:45.910 --> 07:47.904
that fights demons
and silly-Iooking dragons.

07:48.208 --> 07:50.486
- That's different, that's real.
- And this isn't real?

07:50.799 --> 07:53.476
- What is real are those hooded freaks.
- Who are not gonna give up

07:53.764 --> 07:55.837
- now that the sword's in the open.
- How do you know?

07:56.146 --> 07:59.461
Whoever has Excalibur
is unstoppable.

08:02.828 --> 08:05.265
<i>Okay, there's definitely nothing
in the Book.</i>

08:05.543 --> 08:07.776
Oh, hi. How you doing?

08:09.011 --> 08:10.925
Phoebe, please put a stop
to this nonsense.

08:11.222 --> 08:12.977
- Didn't realise you were here.
- That's okay.

08:13.228 --> 08:14.710
You can talk freely in front of him.

08:14.942 --> 08:17.140
Lord knows,
you've been through enough.

08:18.283 --> 08:20.881
- No, not really.
- Phoebe.

08:21.835 --> 08:23.794
Look, I should probably go.

08:24.507 --> 08:27.105
Don't be ridiculous. You're great.

08:27.431 --> 08:29.743
<i>Okay, anyway, Book, Excalibur?</i>

08:30.063 --> 08:31.259
<i>Yeah, nothing, nada.</i>

08:31.526 --> 08:32.881
- Really?
- Told you.

08:33.154 --> 08:36.275
You know, hey, maybe it's been out
of circulation since ye olden days,

08:36.578 --> 08:39.049
and maybe no Halliwell has ever
come across it before.

08:39.378 --> 08:41.976
Well, we have run across these guys,
executioner demons,

08:42.427 --> 08:45.663
- lower-level badasses for hire.
- Who hired them?

08:45.979 --> 08:48.338
This higher-level badass.

08:48.859 --> 08:51.296
"A power-mad paladin
of destruction."

08:52.661 --> 08:55.863
Maybe... You know, maybe we
should just kind of hang out later.

08:56.170 --> 08:59.167
Yeah. Okay. Bye.

08:59.511 --> 09:00.993
Bye.

09:03.939 --> 09:05.056
<i>I don't know.</i>

09:05.735 --> 09:10.132
- Be careful with all this.
- Always. I had...

09:11.250 --> 09:14.565
...a really good time last night.
- Me too.

09:15.718 --> 09:17.233
What?

09:18.016 --> 09:21.331
I just don't think your sisters
like me very much.

09:21.692 --> 09:23.731
- No, that's not true.
- Really?

09:23.990 --> 09:27.510
Okay, maybe they're just doing
the overprotective sister thing.

09:29.043 --> 09:30.033
Well, that's a good thing.

09:30.254 --> 09:33.410
Because I don't want anything
to happen to you.

09:33.723 --> 09:34.793
Don't worry.

09:40.698 --> 09:42.578
So he's an upper-level demon,
which means

09:42.828 --> 09:46.143
you should be able to make
a vanquishing potion.

09:46.462 --> 09:49.299
Okay. Wait. Me? Why me?

09:49.595 --> 09:52.956
Because, hello, I have a few
hundred things to do

09:53.270 --> 09:55.229
around here, in addition
to raising a small child.

09:55.484 --> 09:57.124
I know, you have so much to do.

09:57.364 --> 09:59.882
You're my hero. But I can't,
I have to go to work.

10:00.163 --> 10:02.441
I still don't have an assistant,
and I'm swamped.

10:02.712 --> 10:04.227
But... Phoebe!

10:06.637 --> 10:08.676
Paige, potion?

10:08.976 --> 10:12.132
Oh, I'm sorry, honey, the temp
agency's already got me a new job.

10:12.485 --> 10:14.798
But that hardly compares with...

10:15.076 --> 10:16.717
Come on, you know
there's a magical reason

10:16.954 --> 10:18.389
that I've had every one
of these jobs,

10:18.625 --> 10:20.424
and who am I to interfere
with destiny?

10:20.673 --> 10:24.034
Okay, so you want me
to add "babysit the sword"

10:24.348 --> 10:27.504
and "mix vanquishing potion"
to my never-ending to-do list.

10:27.858 --> 10:30.376
Look, the sword is stuck
in the stone. You know it, I know it,

10:30.656 --> 10:33.413
the bad guys know it. Nobody's gonna
get it out till King Arthur does.

10:33.705 --> 10:35.619
When that happens,
there'll be lots of fireworks.

10:35.876 --> 10:37.471
- When might that be?
- How should I know?

10:37.715 --> 10:39.674
Maybe a couple thousand years?

10:50.288 --> 10:52.760
Well, you can't blame a girl for trying.

11:00.480 --> 11:02.439
Oh, but I do blame you.

11:02.735 --> 11:05.971
The sword is now locked in stone.
You promised me murderers,

11:06.288 --> 11:09.045
what you delivered
was cannon fodder for witches!

11:09.377 --> 11:11.052
Those weren't just witches.

11:11.298 --> 11:14.500
Tell me, demon, will your thick head
still spout excuses

11:14.808 --> 11:16.403
when it's cut from your neck?

11:16.688 --> 11:18.761
If the sword is
with the Charmed Ones,

11:19.028 --> 11:21.499
it means we need a better class
of executioners, that's all.

11:25.543 --> 11:27.298
And how much more
will this cost me?

11:28.090 --> 11:31.246
- The Charmed Ones are formidable.
- How much?

11:31.601 --> 11:33.275
To provide you
with more executioners

11:33.562 --> 11:37.038
and the training needed to drown the
Charmed Ones in their own blood...

11:40.999 --> 11:43.836
...a seat at the table.

11:47.848 --> 11:52.211
If your goal is to unite all evil under
the corrupted power of the sword,

11:52.569 --> 11:55.087
you could do far worse
than have me at your side.

12:01.173 --> 12:04.614
- Responses to last week's columns.
- How'd you get into my e-mail?

12:04.933 --> 12:07.656
Your e-mail account is maxed out,
so your fans are using ours.

12:08.275 --> 12:11.910
Oh, I'll tell you, Elise better find me
a new assistant because pretty soon

12:12.243 --> 12:15.763
she's gonna have to ask Phoebe
to take my foot out of her...

12:18.049 --> 12:20.613
Hello, Phoebe Halliwell.

12:20.890 --> 12:23.009
Oh, hey, Laura.

12:23.269 --> 12:25.023
I have that down...

12:26.444 --> 12:30.569
...for this morning. Oh, my God,
I missed it. I'm so sorry.

12:30.914 --> 12:34.229
No, of course I can reschedule.
Absolutely.

12:35.800 --> 12:39.879
Actually, Laura, can I call you back
when I have my book in front of me?

12:40.229 --> 12:44.148
Okay, great. I'm so sorry.
Thanks. Bye.

12:44.532 --> 12:47.574
Hi, I thought you had
a new temp job today.

12:47.914 --> 12:50.113
- I do.
- Why aren't you there?

12:50.714 --> 12:52.274
Apparently I am.

12:53.554 --> 12:55.992
- What? Here?
- Yep.

12:56.270 --> 12:58.468
- As my assistant?
- Well, I think I'd prefer

12:58.735 --> 13:00.056
to be called your desk manager.

13:00.279 --> 13:03.401
Wait, but I thought you get all
of your temp jobs for divine reasons.

13:03.746 --> 13:04.817
Usually I do.

13:05.041 --> 13:07.400
Yeah, but I don't need divine help,
I need filing

13:07.673 --> 13:09.951
and faxing
and desk-management help.

13:10.262 --> 13:13.258
I'm your girl. I really am.
We'll just, you know, see if

13:13.561 --> 13:15.794
the divine stuff kind of appears later.
It usually does.

13:16.403 --> 13:19.957
Yeah, but I can't tell you what to do.
I mean, how weird is that?

13:20.329 --> 13:21.969
Well, it's no weirder than usual.

13:23.129 --> 13:25.282
- I see.
- Just kidding, sort of.

13:25.549 --> 13:28.272
Listen, you get back to your column.
I will call Laura and reschedule.

13:28.557 --> 13:29.992
I will...

13:30.354 --> 13:32.872
...help stuff.

13:46.144 --> 13:47.865
Perfect.

13:59.343 --> 14:01.143
Hey, lady!

14:05.399 --> 14:07.597
We could really use
an authority figure out there.

14:08.783 --> 14:10.856
- What are you doing here?
- What am I doing here?

14:11.123 --> 14:13.687
I'm getting pushed around!
I just lost my place in line.

14:14.005 --> 14:15.406
What line?

14:23.362 --> 14:25.515
What...? What's going on here?

14:30.754 --> 14:32.348
Never.

14:34.139 --> 14:36.532
- What is this?
- Natural selection.

14:36.812 --> 14:39.489
Naturally, I hope the sword
selects me to be king.

14:39.779 --> 14:41.692
Finally get a little respect around here.

14:47.214 --> 14:51.611
You people, you creatures, whatever.
You can't be here. You gotta go.

14:52.017 --> 14:54.535
We have a divine right to try our hand.

14:55.524 --> 14:56.720
- Wow.
- Yeah.

14:56.945 --> 14:58.586
Ten feet's pretty much the distance.

14:59.202 --> 15:01.001
Back of the line, please.

15:01.415 --> 15:02.485
Hoof it, sister!

15:02.752 --> 15:06.113
Chris! Chris. Get down here.

15:07.304 --> 15:09.263
- Where's Chris?
- Busy.

15:09.810 --> 15:11.292
Let's go.

15:11.565 --> 15:12.966
- What's going on?
- Busy with what?

15:13.236 --> 15:15.994
Other charges. I took him
off your account again.

15:16.286 --> 15:18.245
- Our account?
- You know what I mean.

15:20.587 --> 15:23.823
- Whoa, is that what I think it is?
- No. No, it's not.

15:24.138 --> 15:26.530
Okay, now look, you gotta get
all these people out of here

15:26.813 --> 15:28.646
because I can't do this right now.

15:28.943 --> 15:31.541
Hey, hey, hey! No cuts, buddy.

15:38.925 --> 15:40.565
Hey, how was the staff meeting?

15:40.805 --> 15:42.525
Endless. How's my new assistant
working out?

15:42.769 --> 15:45.685
Oh, she put a fire under the interns,
that's for sure.

15:45.984 --> 15:47.466
Really?

15:48.657 --> 15:50.139
Okay, who can help me with that?

15:50.370 --> 15:53.924
Great, you got it. And what about
collating and cross-referencing?

15:54.256 --> 15:56.375
You. And so you would
have databasing.

15:56.637 --> 15:59.360
All right, great. You boys
have your marching orders.

15:59.643 --> 16:01.762
I will check back with you
in a couple hours.

16:05.576 --> 16:08.572
Wow, who works here?

16:08.919 --> 16:11.596
You do. Who rocks?
That would be me.

16:11.924 --> 16:14.077
By the end of the day,
we'll have a system in place

16:14.347 --> 16:16.818
that tracks your column ideas,
your columns written

16:17.105 --> 16:18.426
and your columns considered,

16:18.650 --> 16:21.647
plus a separate file for your questions,
comments and fan mail.

16:21.992 --> 16:24.190
- I can't believe it.
- Well, believe it because you,

16:24.456 --> 16:27.293
my dear, are never going to miss
anything again.

16:27.631 --> 16:29.146
- That's good.
- It is good news

16:29.384 --> 16:31.105
because you, my dear,
need to concentrate.

16:31.348 --> 16:32.783
Yes, I do.

16:33.020 --> 16:35.822
Yes, you do.
Starting with tomorrow's column.

16:36.150 --> 16:39.386
- I already wrote tomorrow's column.
- Yeah, you did.

16:41.999 --> 16:43.833
Is there a problem with it?

16:44.088 --> 16:46.082
Well, I mean, I'm no expert,

16:46.387 --> 16:48.381
but I was just thinking
about this one question.

16:48.641 --> 16:51.718
Okay, the girl's family wants her
to break up with him

16:52.024 --> 16:53.505
because they think
he's an alcoholic.

16:53.738 --> 16:55.891
And absent of any proof,
you're telling her to end it.

16:56.202 --> 17:00.487
Well, you know, not really end it,
just slow it down a bit.

17:01.214 --> 17:04.733
Okay, but slowing it down
by not seeing each other is,

17:05.057 --> 17:06.459
in effect, ending it.

17:06.728 --> 17:08.961
I just think you should
keep your eyes open.

17:09.736 --> 17:11.411
Keep my eyes open?

17:11.700 --> 17:14.583
I mean, I think that she should keep
her eyes open.

17:14.873 --> 17:18.188
- You know what I mean.
- Yeah.

17:19.593 --> 17:23.433
- This column's about Richard, isn't it?
- No, it is not about Richard.

17:23.770 --> 17:25.125
Don't be ridiculous.

17:26.401 --> 17:29.762
You hate him. I can tell,
and what's worse, he can tell.

17:30.119 --> 17:33.195
Look, Paige, if you're sensing
anything from me, it's just concern.

17:33.545 --> 17:37.020
I'm concerned that you're falling
too fast for a guy you barely know.

17:39.224 --> 17:41.423
But, you know,
it's none of my business.

17:41.731 --> 17:45.046
You're right. It's not
any of your business.

17:47.246 --> 17:48.762
Right.

17:50.419 --> 17:52.174
Hey, Piper needs your help, now.

18:04.580 --> 18:06.175
Pest.

18:08.925 --> 18:10.645
Oh, my!

18:10.888 --> 18:14.043
- I was afraid this would happen.
- You could have mentioned that.

18:14.356 --> 18:16.748
- And they won't leave?
- Oh, no. No.

18:17.027 --> 18:19.989
- More show up every minute.
- But no bad guys yet, right?

18:20.286 --> 18:22.280
What is that stench?
What is that stench?

18:22.584 --> 18:25.227
We gotta get this thing out
of here. Leo refuses to orb it.

18:25.550 --> 18:27.908
The Lady of the Lake came to you.
I'm not messing with that.

18:28.222 --> 18:32.585
Oh, for God's sakes, if you
will not get rid of it, then I will!

18:38.918 --> 18:40.147
Your Majesty.

18:42.090 --> 18:43.731
Wow.

18:59.718 --> 19:02.235
I bet you didn't expect this
when you got up this morning.

19:02.559 --> 19:05.157
- l...
- The sword has chosen.

19:06.316 --> 19:08.470
You are the new saviour.

19:08.740 --> 19:10.540
The champion of good,

19:10.787 --> 19:12.462
the master of Excalibur.

19:14.338 --> 19:17.335
- Welcome to your new destiny.
- Oh, crap.

19:20.018 --> 19:23.095
Okay, let's go. Nothing to see
here anymore,

19:23.402 --> 19:26.125
<i>- no more show, adi?s, scram.
- Your Majesty, seriously,</i>

19:26.410 --> 19:29.452
if you need anything, anything at all.
Castles built, suits of armour,

19:29.752 --> 19:32.065
you name it, I got connections.

19:35.766 --> 19:38.843
Is it just me, or does it still
smell like ogre in here?

19:39.151 --> 19:42.147
I'm telling you, guys,
this is all a big mistake.

19:43.745 --> 19:45.466
- Stop that.
- It's drawn to you,

19:45.707 --> 19:48.590
- just like you're drawn to it.
- Do I look like I'm drawn to it, pal?

19:48.925 --> 19:51.284
- You will be in time.
- No, I don't have time

19:51.555 --> 19:52.546
to play Queen Arthur.

19:53.227 --> 19:57.704
Oh, come on, Piper, have a little fun.
Don't you realise what this means?

19:58.114 --> 19:59.549
One more thing on my to-do list?

19:59.825 --> 20:02.663
No, it means you, my dear,
are the chosen one,

20:03.001 --> 20:05.724
the first in centuries to have
power over the sword.

20:06.010 --> 20:07.411
Tell her all about it, Merlin.

20:08.307 --> 20:12.067
Oh, actually, the name's Mordaunt.
Merlin was just a fairy tale.

20:14.280 --> 20:16.035
But Camelot was not.

20:16.493 --> 20:18.646
And thanks to you, it can rise again.

20:18.959 --> 20:22.081
So, what are you, a wizard,
a sorcerer?

20:22.424 --> 20:25.660
Actually, I'm neither.
I'm just a humble teacher

20:25.975 --> 20:27.570
in service of the sword.

20:27.855 --> 20:29.894
And we must begin
instruction immediately,

20:30.196 --> 20:31.597
before your enemy attacks.

20:31.865 --> 20:33.186
- The Dark Knight.
- You know him?

20:33.412 --> 20:34.847
Yeah, we've already kicked his ass.

20:35.123 --> 20:38.404
And if he shows up again, we have a
vanquishing potion ready and waiting.

20:38.757 --> 20:40.955
- What's in it?
- It's a mandrake variation

20:41.221 --> 20:43.215
with a little bit of griffin's blood.

20:43.478 --> 20:47.396
Good, if you're going up against
a pustulous knave, which you're not.

20:47.778 --> 20:51.298
If you want to fight the Dark Knight
with magic, this is what you need.

20:52.960 --> 20:54.634
I thought you said
you weren't a sorcerer.

20:54.923 --> 20:58.682
I picked up a few things along the way.
The Dark Knight is no trifle.

20:59.017 --> 21:00.976
You'll have to hit him
with everything you have.

21:01.271 --> 21:03.550
I've never even heard of half
of these ingredients.

21:03.861 --> 21:05.741
Looks like he picked up
quite a bit.

21:07.789 --> 21:09.509
What do you think?

21:11.924 --> 21:14.236
- Can't get a read on him.
- Your distrust is expected,

21:14.513 --> 21:17.031
but don't let it blind you.
If I haven't taught Piper

21:17.312 --> 21:20.673
how to master the sword
before the Dark Knight returns,

21:21.030 --> 21:22.750
your survival depends on that potion.

21:23.620 --> 21:25.933
Okay, so where are we supposed
to get the ingredients?

21:26.250 --> 21:30.614
I think I know a place. Leave it to me,
your trusty assistant.

21:31.388 --> 21:34.225
All right, I guess I will go check
with the other Elders

21:34.521 --> 21:36.640
and see what they know.

21:36.944 --> 21:38.665
You want me to take Wyatt?

21:40.076 --> 21:41.831
Piper.

21:42.123 --> 21:43.638
Do you want me to take
Wyatt with me?

21:43.920 --> 21:45.275
Oh, yeah. Sure.

21:48.474 --> 21:49.909
I'll be fine.

21:53.235 --> 21:54.385
En garde!

21:58.164 --> 22:01.684
Not bad.
Better than Arthur's first time.

22:02.050 --> 22:05.604
- Really?
- Now, I'm gonna come in low.

22:07.353 --> 22:11.352
Believe in Excalibur.
Just let it flow through you.

22:17.002 --> 22:19.474
- These are your best?
- The highest quality.

22:19.760 --> 22:22.153
- They'll get the job done.
- They'd better.

22:22.432 --> 22:25.109
If they don't, it's not me
they'll have to answer to.

22:25.399 --> 22:27.997
- I thought you were...
- I serve a greater power.

22:28.322 --> 22:29.997
Whose?

22:33.419 --> 22:34.820
We've got a problem.

22:36.677 --> 22:38.032
Hey!

22:42.232 --> 22:45.832
Well. Should have figured
you'd be after the sword.

22:46.158 --> 22:48.722
- Tell him.
- Kiss my grumpy ass.

22:50.128 --> 22:51.118
Tell him.

22:53.050 --> 22:54.451
You're too late.

22:54.679 --> 22:58.200
Piper Halliwell has Excalibur.
And she's being trained how to use it.

22:58.523 --> 23:01.360
By who? Who's training her?

23:06.167 --> 23:11.168
- Does this change anything?
- It changes everything.

23:19.323 --> 23:23.801
I think we got everything you need.
Plant roots, fungi, herbs,

23:24.169 --> 23:27.166
- creature parts, insects.
- Creature parts?

23:27.470 --> 23:28.906
Fairy wings.

23:29.142 --> 23:30.782
Wait, fairy wings?

23:31.020 --> 23:33.378
Well, I didn't kill them
if that's what you're wondering.

23:33.652 --> 23:35.167
- Then how'd you get them?
- Phoebe.

23:35.406 --> 23:37.445
- What? Fair question.
- Actually, I'm not sure.

23:37.705 --> 23:40.941
My family's been stockpiling this stuff
for years because of the feud.

23:41.297 --> 23:43.211
Yeah, but the feud's over, right?

23:43.509 --> 23:45.184
Hey, you know,
I think we're gonna need

23:45.431 --> 23:48.188
a mortar and pestle for the potion,
do you have one?

23:48.481 --> 23:49.677
Yeah.

23:51.698 --> 23:53.418
What are you doing?

23:53.662 --> 23:55.256
- What?
- You don't have to treat him

23:55.499 --> 23:58.814
- like he's evil.
- Paige, I'm just reacting to what I see.

23:59.174 --> 24:02.489
I mean, how many guys do you
know that stockpile gremlin ears?

24:02.808 --> 24:04.847
Okay, first your not-so-subtle column,
and now this.

24:05.106 --> 24:07.179
Why don't you come out
and admit it? You hate him.

24:07.487 --> 24:10.369
Paige, I don't hate him.
I'm just worried.

24:10.703 --> 24:12.583
Well, don't worry.
I know what I'm doing.

24:12.832 --> 24:15.396
Okay, so are you telling me
that it doesn't bother you at all

24:15.673 --> 24:17.907
that he's using magic again?
Or that he has this...?

24:18.181 --> 24:20.653
This room hidden?

24:20.979 --> 24:24.660
What part of "this is not
your business" are you not getting?

24:24.988 --> 24:27.745
Oh, Paige, I am worried about you.

24:28.038 --> 24:30.681
Okay, just like you were worried
about me when I was dating a demon.

24:30.962 --> 24:34.597
- Richard is not a demon.
- No, I know he's not a demon, Paige.

24:34.929 --> 24:36.923
But he has a dark side
and powerful magic.

24:37.186 --> 24:38.826
And that's a very dangerous
combination.

24:39.065 --> 24:42.346
l... I'm worried about you, okay?
I'm sorry.

24:46.126 --> 24:49.567
- Here.
- Thanks.

24:51.220 --> 24:53.054
Everything all right?

24:56.526 --> 24:58.485
Let's just get this over with.

25:18.455 --> 25:20.848
- You're a quick study.
- You're a good teacher.

25:21.965 --> 25:25.042
So you feel the sword's power?

25:25.388 --> 25:27.462
- Yes.
- How's it feel?

25:28.648 --> 25:29.685
Not bad.

25:31.739 --> 25:33.972
You and Excalibur are becoming one.

25:35.248 --> 25:37.925
Soon, nothing will matter.

25:38.254 --> 25:40.977
Nothing except the desire to rule.

25:52.122 --> 25:53.193
You.

25:53.459 --> 25:56.136
I was wondering when you'd show up.
Take him!

26:09.332 --> 26:13.013
- "Wereboar tusk, one pinch.
- Okay.

26:13.678 --> 26:15.033
Nymph hair, one lock.

26:15.264 --> 26:18.180
Oh, I hope this isn't
from someone we know.

26:18.814 --> 26:22.209
Wraith essence, three drops.

26:23.118 --> 26:26.832
- One, two, three.
- And black poppy,

26:27.170 --> 26:29.768
- one level teaspoon."
- I've never even heard of black...

26:30.093 --> 26:31.323
No!

26:33.977 --> 26:35.971
Phoebe, you okay?

26:38.406 --> 26:42.086
- Richard.
- Wait, watch.

26:44.044 --> 26:46.881
Don't ever mix wraith essence
and black poppy.

26:47.804 --> 26:50.641
- Ever.
- Why would Mordaunt do this?

26:50.978 --> 26:52.413
Because he wants you dead.

27:17.379 --> 27:19.532
- I thought we made a deal.
- I don't need you

27:19.800 --> 27:21.521
to get the sword anymore.

27:24.227 --> 27:26.027
I've got her.

27:31.537 --> 27:33.417
Your assimilation is complete.

27:34.169 --> 27:36.288
You are now one with Excalibur.

27:36.591 --> 27:38.186
Now what?

27:40.310 --> 27:42.987
- It's just us.
- He's not what you think he is.

27:43.274 --> 27:45.508
- He tried to kill us.
- He wants the sword.

27:46.074 --> 27:47.349
But the sword chose me.

27:47.619 --> 27:50.821
No, he's just using you, he wants
the power of the sword for himself.

27:51.171 --> 27:53.735
You're not meant
to control the sword.

27:54.095 --> 27:55.530
But I do control it.

27:58.104 --> 27:59.778
And you don't think I can.

28:02.072 --> 28:03.302
Perhaps we should leave.

28:04.872 --> 28:07.264
- Paige. Paige, Paige, Paige.
- Excalibur!

28:11.847 --> 28:13.761
Don't do that again.

28:15.522 --> 28:17.595
It appears your queen has spoken.

28:21.621 --> 28:24.742
Her Majesty has left the building.

28:25.087 --> 28:26.921
Or Her Madness.

28:33.817 --> 28:36.129
Doesn't look like much of a kingdom.

28:36.617 --> 28:39.340
Well, this is just where it begins,

28:39.624 --> 28:41.982
where you form your inner circle.

28:42.465 --> 28:45.381
Let me guess,
the Knights of the Round Table?

28:45.683 --> 28:47.802
The knights of your Round Table.

28:48.438 --> 28:52.676
You're on a new path now,
a new destiny.

28:53.660 --> 28:57.295
That's good because I was
getting a little bored of the old one.

28:57.628 --> 28:59.748
A world of adventure awaits you.

29:00.008 --> 29:03.323
Warfare, conquest,

29:03.642 --> 29:05.556
Camelot.

29:06.274 --> 29:10.991
- And what exactly is Camelot?
- Whatever you want it to be.

29:11.412 --> 29:13.610
It's your kingdom to make.

29:13.876 --> 29:15.835
Could you be a little more specific?

29:16.884 --> 29:20.929
There will be no one above you,
no one to challenge you.

29:21.312 --> 29:24.194
You will have free rein
to reshape the way things are,

29:24.528 --> 29:27.843
to create a world of your dreams.

29:28.830 --> 29:31.907
All will bow down before you.

29:32.256 --> 29:34.569
All will serve your every desire.

29:35.223 --> 29:39.016
- Including you?
- Especially me, my queen.

29:58.362 --> 30:00.083
What is it?

30:02.246 --> 30:04.126
Well, we must...

30:04.712 --> 30:06.432
...build your kingdom first.

30:06.674 --> 30:10.833
And to do that, we need to fill
your Round Table with knights.

30:12.399 --> 30:14.871
- Very well, I have a few ideas.
- No.

30:16.699 --> 30:20.220
Let me be your counsel.
I know best who will serve you well.

30:20.543 --> 30:22.058
But they will not come easily.

30:22.339 --> 30:25.734
You must challenge them
on fields of battle.

30:26.099 --> 30:27.820
Force them to join you.

30:36.542 --> 30:38.901
I think I can do that.

30:45.981 --> 30:49.262
- Anything?
- Nope, can't find Piper anywhere.

30:49.575 --> 30:52.138
Well. Keep looking, she's bound
to show up somewhere.

30:52.414 --> 30:54.008
- Yeah, to do what?
- I don't know.

30:54.251 --> 30:57.247
I don't understand. If she wasn't
supposed to pull the sword out,

30:57.551 --> 30:59.864
- then why was she able to?
- According to the other Elders,

31:00.142 --> 31:03.264
she was only meant to pass it on
to whomever it was really meant for.

31:03.610 --> 31:06.890
So she's not the new King Arthur,
but she is the new Lady of the Lake?

31:07.243 --> 31:10.080
- Basically, yeah.
- Well, why is it turning her evil?

31:10.417 --> 31:12.934
Because only the ultimate power
on Earth can handle Excalibur.

31:13.217 --> 31:14.732
That's why the lady
stayed in the lake,

31:14.971 --> 31:16.692
to insulate herself
from the sword's power.

31:16.976 --> 31:19.653
Okay, so we should find Piper
and then drown her.

31:21.069 --> 31:23.108
- Oh, I'm just kidding, Leo.
- It's no joke.

31:23.367 --> 31:26.363
It's the only way to keep the power
from consuming her, destroying her.

31:27.879 --> 31:29.998
Still, what does Mordaunt
want with Piper?

31:30.258 --> 31:33.460
I mean, he's tricky, but he's hardly
the ultimate power on Earth.

31:33.809 --> 31:35.642
But he can use Piper
to become that power.

31:38.655 --> 31:40.295
Guess who just surfaced.

31:48.344 --> 31:51.386
- Should I kill him?
- You're the queen.

31:51.897 --> 31:54.574
I need one more knight
to sit at my Round Table.

31:54.863 --> 31:58.623
- Care to join me?
- Join you? Which side are you on?

31:58.955 --> 32:02.111
All we're interested in
is the greatest power.

32:02.423 --> 32:03.778
Become one of us.

32:05.556 --> 32:07.675
- What he said.
- What do I get out of it?

32:07.938 --> 32:09.896
You? You get to live.

32:11.571 --> 32:13.644
- Piper!
- I should have known it was a trap!

32:14.745 --> 32:18.459
- You stay put. You, I warned you.
- Sorry, Your Majesty.

32:20.385 --> 32:22.664
Paige, now, orb her.

32:29.865 --> 32:34.184
Impressive, huh?
Now, make your queen proud.

32:41.854 --> 32:43.289
- What just happened?
- I don't know,

32:43.525 --> 32:45.085
but I don't think it's good.

32:50.501 --> 32:52.142
Leo!

32:57.227 --> 32:58.457
Welcome.

32:58.687 --> 33:01.159
I assume you're all wondering
why you've been gathered here.

33:01.444 --> 33:05.363
But don't worry, if I wanted to kill you,
I would have done so already.

33:05.706 --> 33:09.625
You are the chosen few
who will help chart a new world order,

33:09.967 --> 33:11.801
united under me.

33:12.096 --> 33:15.059
Excuse me, Your Majesty,
we're getting ahead of ourselves.

33:15.354 --> 33:19.069
- Are we?
- The small matter of the loyalty oath.

33:20.660 --> 33:23.098
Yeah. That's right.

33:23.749 --> 33:26.745
- Administer that oath.
- Yes, Your Majesty.

33:27.050 --> 33:30.171
If you will all put
your left hand...

33:32.021 --> 33:33.696
...or claw

33:33.943 --> 33:36.620
on one of the five points
of the pentagram in front of you.

33:50.232 --> 33:53.787
Supreme demonic powers,
leave your hosts!

33:54.327 --> 33:57.563
And find a new home
in this willing heart!

33:58.630 --> 33:59.985
What are you doing?

34:00.343 --> 34:02.143
Stop!

34:16.380 --> 34:18.614
You vanquished all my knights. Why?

34:24.235 --> 34:27.312
Fulfilling my centuries-old quest...

34:28.119 --> 34:30.192
...to control Excalibur.

34:30.876 --> 34:34.237
- But it belongs to me.
- No. It doesn't.

34:35.722 --> 34:38.605
It never did. But thanks to you

34:38.898 --> 34:41.621
and the combined powers
of your knights,

34:41.902 --> 34:43.543
now it belongs to me.

34:44.995 --> 34:46.670
I'm the ultimate power.

34:47.918 --> 34:49.239
I don't understand.

34:50.467 --> 34:52.938
It's simply a transfer of power,
that's all.

34:53.264 --> 34:55.179
And now all that remains
to do...

34:55.856 --> 34:58.694
...is to eliminate the true recipient
of Excalibur

34:58.988 --> 35:02.748
before he grows old enough
to fulfil his destiny

35:03.082 --> 35:05.725
as the son of a Charmed One.

35:07.132 --> 35:09.855
You can't hurt him, he's protected.

35:11.896 --> 35:13.297
I couldn't before.

35:15.029 --> 35:17.227
But I can with this.

35:33.742 --> 35:35.257
Feeling any better?

35:35.496 --> 35:40.214
No, I'm pretty sure "ow" signifies that
I am not, in fact, feeling any better.

35:41.888 --> 35:45.648
I am getting tired of this whole
soul-separating-from-my-body thing.

35:45.980 --> 35:47.655
It's getting to be a disturbing pattern.

35:47.944 --> 35:51.146
It was pretty close too. Your souls
were getting ready to move on.

35:51.453 --> 35:54.096
- Move on to where exactly?
- Nice try.

35:55.837 --> 35:58.035
I can't believe Piper.
Did you see the look in her eyes?

35:58.345 --> 36:01.341
Hey, at least it looked like
she was having fun for once.

36:02.270 --> 36:03.945
- Find her yet?
- No, nothing.

36:04.193 --> 36:07.395
Keep trying. Just like last time, they
can't do anything until they resurface.

36:07.701 --> 36:10.218
Yeah, unless Mordaunt wants her
to help him rule the underworld.

36:10.750 --> 36:13.143
There's gotta be another way
to get her out of this.

36:13.466 --> 36:15.619
I just wish we knew
who King Arthur is.

36:16.432 --> 36:19.075
- Wait, what do you mean?
- I mean, if we need to separate

36:19.356 --> 36:21.589
Piper from the sword,
what better way than figure out

36:21.862 --> 36:23.616
who she's meant to give it to?

36:28.044 --> 36:29.525
No.

36:30.969 --> 36:34.011
It's Wyatt. Oh, my God.
It has to be.

36:36.691 --> 36:38.571
- What's the matter?
- It's Piper, she's hurt.

36:41.661 --> 36:44.020
- Harding Park. Let's go.
- I got Wyatt.

36:49.472 --> 36:53.437
Don't worry, it'll all be over soon.

36:53.817 --> 36:56.381
Once they come for you,
I'll go for him.

36:59.957 --> 37:01.790
- Hurry! Hurry, hurry!
- I am, I am.

37:07.267 --> 37:08.497
Where's Wyatt?

37:15.998 --> 37:18.390
My apologies, King Wyatt.

37:18.713 --> 37:21.595
I guess it just wasn't meant to be.

37:31.368 --> 37:32.929
What?!

37:33.917 --> 37:36.071
And that's his favourite teddy bear.

37:41.143 --> 37:42.737
Hey.

37:44.693 --> 37:47.052
Bet you didn't expect this
when you got up this morning.

37:47.619 --> 37:49.452
But I've still got Excalibur!

37:49.747 --> 37:51.706
- Not for long.
- Go for it, Wyatt.

38:16.356 --> 38:20.240
Okay, sweetie,
that's very, very good.

38:20.993 --> 38:26.028
But we need to put this away
so you don't put an eye out.

38:26.424 --> 38:28.497
At least until you're 18.

38:38.286 --> 38:39.437
How are you?

38:39.914 --> 38:43.229
Oh, fine. Think you can orb this
into the attic?

38:43.590 --> 38:45.185
Absolutely.

38:48.479 --> 38:50.632
Away from any furniture?

38:53.365 --> 38:54.401
Sorry.

38:55.077 --> 38:56.991
Don't worry,
I'll just add it to my list.

39:13.499 --> 39:16.814
Hey, I just finished the last of the filing.

39:17.383 --> 39:20.585
- Great, thanks.
- Is that tomorrow's copy?

39:20.891 --> 39:23.124
Yeah, I'm just doing some
last-minute changes.

39:23.399 --> 39:26.919
This woman right here
is worried that her mother

39:27.241 --> 39:29.121
- might be marrying the wrong guy.
- Really?

39:29.373 --> 39:31.446
Yeah, she thinks he might be
the devil incarnate.

39:31.752 --> 39:34.190
Didn't we vanquish
the devil incarnate?

39:35.219 --> 39:37.053
I told her

39:37.309 --> 39:40.829
that unless she has absolute proof,
she should probably butt out

39:41.152 --> 39:42.986
and let her sister live her own life.

39:43.280 --> 39:46.482
- I thought this was about a mother.
- Yeah, well, you know what I mean.

39:46.832 --> 39:47.902
Yeah, I think I do.

39:48.128 --> 39:51.921
It's funny, this is the first job I've gotten
without a magical reason behind it.

39:52.305 --> 39:55.187
Well, there may not have been
a magical reason,

39:55.479 --> 39:56.880
but there was definitely a reason.

39:58.694 --> 40:00.734
I just have to learn
to take my own advice.

40:00.993 --> 40:04.195
Yeah, well, don't stop
worrying about me too much.

40:04.668 --> 40:05.898
Okay.

40:07.091 --> 40:11.249
Hey, sorry to interrupt.
You ready to go?

40:11.602 --> 40:14.359
Yeah. We're going out.
Do you wanna join?

40:14.692 --> 40:17.894
I would love to, actually,

40:18.203 --> 40:20.401
but I'm gonna take a rain check.
It's been a long day.

40:20.707 --> 40:21.698
Okay. Good night.

40:26.096 --> 40:27.976
Hey, Paige,

40:28.270 --> 40:32.633
- you're fired.
- Actually, I quit.

40:54.543 --> 40:56.741
Listen, I want you to promise me

40:57.008 --> 40:59.731
that before we take that thing
out of storage,

41:00.014 --> 41:02.816
that you're gonna play lots
of football and baseball

41:03.105 --> 41:07.423
and have lots of normal toys,
and maybe we'll even get a dog.

41:07.785 --> 41:09.345
What do you think?

41:10.582 --> 41:12.381
How we doing?

41:12.963 --> 41:16.040
His Highness seems content.

41:16.931 --> 41:19.130
- What about you?
- I'm doing all right.

41:19.397 --> 41:22.199
At least I have my priorities straight
now. I was so busy doing stuff,

41:22.489 --> 41:24.483
and all I really wanted to do
was hang out with him.

41:25.871 --> 41:28.183
Well, you should have more time
for that now.

41:29.714 --> 41:31.469
- I fixed the washer.
- You did?

41:31.719 --> 41:36.721
And the sink and the cable
and the toilet.

41:37.107 --> 41:41.312
Wow, I forgot how handy you were
to have around the house.

41:45.587 --> 41:47.228
Pretty strange, huh?

41:48.885 --> 41:50.445
Kind of scary, actually.

41:50.724 --> 41:52.638
- Why?
- Well, we've seen what he can do

41:52.896 --> 41:56.211
without the sword. I can't begin
to imagine what he could do with it.

41:57.240 --> 41:59.280
Well, whatever it is,
it's meant to be.

41:59.581 --> 42:03.022
Doesn't make it
any less scary, though.

42:03.339 --> 42:06.859
But that's tomorrow's problem.
I'll worry about it then.

42:07.182 --> 42:09.255
Okey-dokey.
