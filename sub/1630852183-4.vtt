WEBVTT

00:09.677 --> 00:11.595
[Camille]
It's the Winter Solstice,

00:11.595 --> 00:13.055
and as the North Pole tilts

00:13.055 --> 00:15.683
the furthest it ever will
from the Sun today,

00:15.683 --> 00:17.518
we will have the shortest day

00:17.518 --> 00:20.396
and the longest night
of the entire year.

00:20.396 --> 00:22.106
[all chanting]

00:22.106 --> 00:23.733
Across many cultures,

00:23.733 --> 00:27.361
there's a shared belief that
tonight on this long night,

00:27.361 --> 00:31.282
the old must end
in order to begin anew.

00:31.282 --> 00:33.117
The surprises
just keep coming with you.

00:33.117 --> 00:34.410
And with you.

00:34.410 --> 00:35.619
I tell you I'm engaged,

00:35.619 --> 00:37.621
and you show up
and boycott my restaurant.

00:37.621 --> 00:40.332
Oh, right.

00:40.332 --> 00:41.834
Wait, you're serious.

00:41.834 --> 00:44.503
Ian, you can't possibly think
that's what this is all about.

00:44.503 --> 00:45.588
Yeah, I can.
I do.

00:45.588 --> 00:48.799
Wow. The male ego
rarely disappoints.

00:48.799 --> 00:50.760
[scoffs]
Unlike a woman scorned.

00:50.760 --> 00:52.136
I am not scorned!

00:52.136 --> 00:53.512
That-that-that's
not what this is.

00:53.512 --> 00:54.722
And for the record,

00:54.722 --> 00:55.806
I didn't even know
that you worked here.

00:55.806 --> 00:57.266
Somehow you left that out
in the whole,

00:57.266 --> 01:00.102
"Hi, Camille, I'm back,
and I'm engaged" messiness.

01:00.102 --> 01:01.687
Ah, you see?
You are pissed.

01:01.687 --> 01:03.647
No. You know what?

01:03.647 --> 01:05.357
I am not even actually sure

01:05.357 --> 01:07.693
what this exact combination of
emotions I'm feeling right now

01:07.693 --> 01:10.321
is, but pissed definitely feels
like a oversimplification.

01:10.321 --> 01:11.655
Are you gonna keep protesting

01:11.655 --> 01:13.157
now that you know
this is my restaurant?

01:13.157 --> 01:15.326
It's not your restaurant!

01:15.326 --> 01:18.871
You are nowhere
in the marketing of it, Ian.

01:18.871 --> 01:20.581
They gentrified your ass
out of the poster

01:20.581 --> 01:22.208
along with the rest
of the Black folks in Harlem.

01:22.208 --> 01:24.168
All right, whatever. The
picture is a fucking mistake.

01:24.168 --> 01:25.461
- I told them to get rid of it.
- Yeah.

01:25.461 --> 01:28.297
But the food,
the recipes, they're mine.

01:28.297 --> 01:29.924
It is not yours!

01:29.924 --> 01:31.842
It is yet another
white-owned business

01:31.842 --> 01:33.302
forcing out a Harlem staple

01:33.302 --> 01:35.095
from a neighborhood
that it helped build.

01:35.095 --> 01:37.181
You just happen
to be complicit.

01:37.181 --> 01:38.557
Complicit?

01:38.557 --> 01:41.727
Ray's went out of business
on its own, months ago.

01:41.727 --> 01:43.896
That has nothing to do with me.
I feel bad about it.

01:43.896 --> 01:45.940
Honestly, answer me this,
Camille.

01:45.940 --> 01:48.150
How is this any different
than you teaching at Columbia,

01:48.150 --> 01:51.278
a school with roots in
the slave trade, over an HBCU?

01:51.278 --> 01:52.696
Oh, girl,
I know you not talking.

01:52.696 --> 01:55.282
I am the one who told you that
when they offered me the job.

01:55.282 --> 01:57.159
You are the one who said,
"Oh, well, you know,

01:57.159 --> 01:59.578
being one of the few Black PhDs
can make a difference."

01:59.578 --> 02:01.956
Exactly.
I didn't fucking protest you.

02:01.956 --> 02:03.749
I know how to be
a supportive partner.

02:03.749 --> 02:06.001
Wow. Did you really
just say that?

02:06.001 --> 02:08.838
Camille, there are
so few Black head chefs

02:08.838 --> 02:09.713
in fine dining.

02:09.713 --> 02:11.257
There's hardly any of us.

02:11.257 --> 02:12.716
With this investment group
I got behind me,

02:12.716 --> 02:15.678
I got a serious shot
at a Michelin star.

02:15.678 --> 02:17.137
That's gonna put me
ahead of the pack.

02:17.137 --> 02:19.306
Then I can open up
my own place.

02:19.306 --> 02:20.850
You understand?

02:20.850 --> 02:23.686
It's a step towards a long-term
plan I got going on.

02:23.686 --> 02:26.021
The problem with your plans

02:26.021 --> 02:28.274
is that they never take
into consideration

02:28.274 --> 02:29.984
anyone else but you.

02:29.984 --> 02:31.485
It's always been that way.

02:31.485 --> 02:32.903
Right.

02:32.903 --> 02:34.947
And there's nothing personal
about any of this.

02:34.947 --> 02:38.659
No. You know what?
Yeah, this part is personal.

02:38.659 --> 02:40.077
Fuck you.

02:40.077 --> 02:42.788
Fuck you!

02:42.788 --> 02:45.708
- Ooh.
- I didn't want to interrupt.

02:45.708 --> 02:47.167
You just heard all of that?

02:47.167 --> 02:49.587
[Dr. Pruitt] I did,
but I will pretend I didn't.

02:49.587 --> 02:51.964
- We'll start again.
- Yeah.

02:51.964 --> 02:53.257
I am moderating a panel

02:53.257 --> 02:55.175
on the effects
of charter schools

02:55.175 --> 02:56.969
on Black children in New York.

02:56.969 --> 03:00.264
Oh! Part of my dissertation
was about that.

03:00.264 --> 03:02.433
Yes, I know.
That's why I'm coming to you.

03:02.433 --> 03:03.559
Oh.

03:03.559 --> 03:06.145
One of my panelists
is Jameson...

03:06.145 --> 03:07.938
Royce.
The...the social justice guy?

03:07.938 --> 03:10.024
-Yes. He's insufferable.
- He's...yeah.

03:10.024 --> 03:11.734
My other panelist cancelled.

03:11.734 --> 03:14.111
She's got a sick kid
or a sick dog or something.

03:14.111 --> 03:16.322
I don't know. I just stopped
listening after a while.

03:16.322 --> 03:17.656
- Oh.
- And my replacement

03:17.656 --> 03:18.949
is not available,

03:18.949 --> 03:21.160
and my replacement's
replacement is not available,

03:21.160 --> 03:23.037
so you'll step in.

03:23.037 --> 03:24.663
Today?

03:24.663 --> 03:26.749
Uh, without any preparation?

03:26.749 --> 03:28.459
Here's the thing.

03:28.459 --> 03:29.835
Where I come from,

03:29.835 --> 03:33.172
when your boss
asks you to do something

03:33.172 --> 03:37.176
in a rhetorical fashion,
the answer should be...

03:37.176 --> 03:39.970
Yes. I said yes.
I had to.

03:39.970 --> 03:41.472
Which means canceling
my therapy appointment

03:41.472 --> 03:43.057
because, of course,
it's at the same time.

03:43.057 --> 03:44.433
And I really needed
therapy today,

03:44.433 --> 03:46.101
especially after
that fight with Ian.

03:46.101 --> 03:48.395
Do you know what he had
the audacity to say to me?

03:48.395 --> 03:50.481
No. No, no, no. Remember,
we are moving on from Ian.

03:50.481 --> 03:51.732
Yeah, you're right.
No, we are.

03:51.732 --> 03:53.275
We're totally
moving on from Ian.

03:55.444 --> 03:57.529
He said that I wasn't
a supportive partner.

03:57.529 --> 04:00.282
Can you believe that shit?
Me? Not supportive?

04:00.282 --> 04:01.533
I mean, I should've
checked his ass

04:01.533 --> 04:02.868
for even letting that
come out of his mouth.

04:02.868 --> 04:04.036
You know what
I should have said was...

04:04.036 --> 04:05.287
Mm-mm, mm-mm.
Here we go.

04:05.287 --> 04:06.914
See, you always do this, okay?

04:06.914 --> 04:08.666
You stew on shit for hours,
and then all of a sudden,

04:08.666 --> 04:10.876
you play a few rounds of
"what I should've said is..."

04:10.876 --> 04:13.754
Well, I should have said a lot.

04:13.754 --> 04:15.589
And you know what?
It's not too late.

04:15.589 --> 04:16.507
I'ma let his ass know right...

04:16.507 --> 04:17.967
Put the phone down and breathe.

04:17.967 --> 04:19.885
I am breathing, bitch!

04:19.885 --> 04:21.595
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

04:21.595 --> 04:23.222
I am not mad at you.

04:23.222 --> 04:25.766
I'm mad at Ian
and all these guys, you know,

04:25.766 --> 04:28.185
who-who only think
about their own needs.

04:28.185 --> 04:29.853
Fuck every last one of 'em.

04:29.853 --> 04:32.856
Sorry I'm late.
[sobbing]

04:32.856 --> 04:35.192
Britt, sweetie.
Are you okay?

04:35.192 --> 04:36.318
Never been better.

04:36.318 --> 04:38.112
You're literally crying.

04:38.112 --> 04:41.198
The wedding is off.

04:41.198 --> 04:43.158
-Paul cheated...
- [both gasp]

04:43.158 --> 04:44.368
With the caterer.

04:44.368 --> 04:46.495
Oh, my God.
Brittany, I'm so sorry.

04:46.495 --> 04:48.080
I hate it.

04:48.080 --> 04:50.457
And tonight's
bachelorette party is still on.

04:50.457 --> 04:51.959
Luelle's wouldn't give me
my deposit back,

04:51.959 --> 04:54.920
so I hired strippers, and now
it's a "fuck love" party.

04:54.920 --> 04:56.922
Strippers? Girl,
we eat there all the time.

04:56.922 --> 04:58.132
Is that even sanitary?

04:58.132 --> 05:00.342
You both better come.
And invite anyone.

05:00.342 --> 05:02.970
I'm putting it on Paul's AMEX.
Fucker.

05:02.970 --> 05:04.304
[Pilates instructor]
Now, let's all begin

05:04.304 --> 05:08.267
- with some cleansing breaths.
- [phone dings]

05:08.267 --> 05:10.519
He Venmo'd me?

05:10.519 --> 05:13.105
- Who Venmo'd you?
- That asshole from Prestige.

05:13.105 --> 05:15.357
He tricks me into coming
to a pyramid scheme,

05:15.357 --> 05:18.152
and then he Venmos me
for 12 measly dollars

05:18.152 --> 05:19.611
for a lobster roll.

05:19.611 --> 05:21.864
Quiet, please.
We're in a class.

05:21.864 --> 05:23.282
And we are in a crisis!

05:23.282 --> 05:25.034
I mean, am I not worth $12?

05:25.034 --> 05:26.785
You're worth $12.
We all are.

05:26.785 --> 05:28.287
What the hell is wrong
with these men?

05:28.287 --> 05:30.497
We are good women.
We don't deserve this shit!

05:30.497 --> 05:33.125
- No, we don't.
- Man, fuck this Venmo asshole!

05:33.125 --> 05:34.251
[Camille]
Yeah. And fuck Ian.

05:34.251 --> 05:35.753
You know what?
Niggas ain't shit.

05:35.753 --> 05:37.129
And these white niggas
ain't shit either.

05:37.129 --> 05:38.338
Sure the fuck aren't.

05:38.338 --> 05:40.007
Motherfucking Paul
and his cheating ass!

05:40.007 --> 05:42.259
You know what?
Fuck all these niggas.

05:42.259 --> 05:43.260
Girl, fuck 'em.

05:43.260 --> 05:44.845
These white niggas,
Black niggas,

05:44.845 --> 05:47.556
brown, yellow, red, green,
and blue niggas too.

05:47.556 --> 05:48.932
Fuck all the niggas
of the rainbow.

05:48.932 --> 05:50.559
'Cause none of these niggas
ain't shit.

05:50.559 --> 05:52.644
[Pilates instructor]
Ladies, I am so sorry,

05:52.644 --> 05:55.481
but maybe you would be more
comfortable in another class.

05:55.481 --> 05:57.608
We don't allow
racial epithets here.

05:57.608 --> 05:59.777
- "Racial epithets"?
- Pardon me,

05:59.777 --> 06:04.031
but we can say nigga because
we are, in fact, some niggas.

06:04.031 --> 06:06.033
I do not know what to say.

06:06.033 --> 06:07.785
And this is so awkward,

06:07.785 --> 06:10.621
but I'm gonna have
to ask you to leave.

06:10.621 --> 06:12.372
- Okay.
- Fine.

06:12.372 --> 06:13.248
That's fine.

06:13.248 --> 06:16.960
[both scoff]

06:16.960 --> 06:18.087
[both]
Nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga.

06:18.087 --> 06:20.464
Nigga, nigga,
nigga, nigga, nigga.

06:20.464 --> 06:22.674
[Brittany] Um, I actually
paid for this class,

06:22.674 --> 06:23.675
so I'm wondering if I can...

06:23.675 --> 06:24.885
[both] Nigga!

06:26.720 --> 06:29.389
Okay, CJ. Don't go too short.
It's for...

06:29.389 --> 06:30.974
- Forbes. I know. I got you.
- Okay.

06:30.974 --> 06:33.852
- Yo, yo, yo. What's poppin'?
- Yo.

06:33.852 --> 06:36.563
Yo, let me tell you about
this shorty I had last night.

06:36.563 --> 06:38.440
I beat the brakes
off that monkey.

06:38.440 --> 06:40.025
Skeeted on her face
and everything.

06:40.025 --> 06:41.652
Like rah, rah, rah!

06:41.652 --> 06:45.197
Look, I'm telling you,
these hos bust it wide open

06:45.197 --> 06:47.699
for a six-piece nugget.
No fries.

06:47.699 --> 06:49.827
Yo, you gon' handle this?

06:49.827 --> 06:51.411
He's new.
He don't know the rules.

06:51.411 --> 06:53.539
Yo, Ant, chill.
You got a lady present.

06:53.539 --> 06:54.623
[Ant] Maybe the lady
shouldn't try so hard

06:54.623 --> 06:55.707
to look like a dude.

06:55.707 --> 06:57.376
Barbershop is a safe space.

06:57.376 --> 06:59.461
You're not using
the term "safe space"

06:59.461 --> 07:01.296
correctly, dumbass.

07:01.296 --> 07:03.674
Yeah. Well, she just laying
there, all nutted on and shit.

07:03.674 --> 07:05.717
Yo, CJ, please get yo boy.

07:05.717 --> 07:07.594
[CJ] Tye, what can I do?
Ant's family.

07:07.594 --> 07:08.846
I've been coming here
for years.

07:08.846 --> 07:11.098
[CJ] We fam,
but me and Ant are fam-i-ly.

07:11.098 --> 07:13.851
He's my mom's sister's
son's nephew. We cousins, Tye.

07:13.851 --> 07:16.520
So anyway, I 'bout
to titty-fuck the ho, right?

07:16.520 --> 07:17.980
And then, suddenly, I realized

07:17.980 --> 07:19.523
shorty got one titty bigger
than the other!

07:19.523 --> 07:21.733
[Tye]
Fuck this. I'm out.

07:21.733 --> 07:23.443
[Megan Thee Stallion]

07:23.443 --> 07:25.696
a watch, I keep a whip...

07:25.696 --> 07:27.072
Was it something I said?

07:27.072 --> 07:29.199
- [laughter]
- What? What'd I say?

07:29.199 --> 07:31.743
Come on, bruh.
Come on, man.

07:31.743 --> 07:32.911
Come on, bruh.

07:32.911 --> 07:34.413
Come on, B.
I'm desperate.

07:34.413 --> 07:36.707
You really don't got nobody
who could cut my hair?!

07:36.707 --> 07:38.792
I'll take a wash girl
at this point.

07:38.792 --> 07:40.669
Nah, dude.
The shoot is tomorrow.

07:40.669 --> 07:43.297
So next Tuesday
really doesn't help me.

07:43.297 --> 07:45.424
Come on.
You really can't fit me in?

07:45.424 --> 07:47.092
It's Forbes !

07:47.092 --> 07:50.721
I'll pay you double. Triple.

07:50.721 --> 07:53.223
No, I'm not keeping your kids
for the weekend, Shanice.

07:53.223 --> 07:55.058
How the hell
is that a fair trade?

07:55.058 --> 07:56.685
You're buggin'.

07:59.980 --> 08:01.690
now these...

08:08.572 --> 08:09.740
Hey, girl.

08:09.740 --> 08:10.949
Welcome to
Get the Musical.

08:10.949 --> 08:14.203
I'm Aundrea.
Sunken Place Chorus.

08:14.203 --> 08:15.704
- You?
- Hey.

08:15.704 --> 08:17.831
Angie.
The same, I guess.

08:17.831 --> 08:19.333
Eric. I'm the teacup.

08:19.333 --> 08:21.418
Jesus.
Someone plays the teacup?

08:21.418 --> 08:24.129
- Not just someone. Me, bitch.
[Aundrea] Queen.

08:24.129 --> 08:26.048
I knew this was gonna be
a corny-ass piece of shit.

08:26.048 --> 08:27.966
Mm-mm.
No, I can't do this.

08:27.966 --> 08:29.468
Who cares?
It's Get Out.

08:29.468 --> 08:31.094
Anyone who's anyone
in Black Hollywood

08:31.094 --> 08:32.387
gon' roll out to support.

08:32.387 --> 08:33.889
Being in this is going
to be like auditioning

08:33.889 --> 08:37.017
for every director, producer,
and actor that matters.

08:37.017 --> 08:38.352
Hamilton all over.

08:38.352 --> 08:39.728
Everybody there
from the lead to the chorus

08:39.728 --> 08:40.979
got mad job offers.

08:40.979 --> 08:41.939
Oh, yeah?

08:41.939 --> 08:43.190
[Eric] Yes, girl.
Get this money.

08:43.190 --> 08:45.234
- Okay, well, talk to me then.
[Eric] Okay.

08:45.234 --> 08:46.318
Angela Wilson?

08:46.318 --> 08:49.363
Okay. My mama
don't even call me that.

08:49.363 --> 08:51.031
Just got paperwork
from Actors' Equity,

08:51.031 --> 08:52.199
says you're not in the union.

08:52.199 --> 08:54.243
Oh, nah, I'm more of a singer.

08:54.243 --> 08:56.453
And I'm more of a supermodel.
And yet, here we are.

08:56.453 --> 08:59.081
Here, you're still an actor,
and you have to join.

08:59.081 --> 09:01.500
$600 initiation fee.
Check or credit card?

09:01.500 --> 09:03.335
$600?

09:03.335 --> 09:05.295
Can't you just take it out
of my pay?

09:05.295 --> 09:07.965
You know, spread it out over, I
don't know, a couple of years?

09:07.965 --> 09:11.218
Nope. Union Production
means union actors only.

09:11.218 --> 09:13.095
Surprised you were even cast.

09:13.095 --> 09:15.138
End of the week,
or we have to recast.

09:15.180 --> 09:18.600
[R&B music playing]

09:18.600 --> 09:19.726
[Jameson] Look, folks,

09:19.726 --> 09:20.978
all you have to do is
look at the numbers.

09:20.978 --> 09:23.397
There's a reason charter
schools are in 42 states.

09:23.397 --> 09:24.564
They work.

09:24.564 --> 09:26.900
And there's a McDonald's
in all 50 states,

09:26.900 --> 09:28.860
but does that mean
they're good for you?

09:28.860 --> 09:30.320
Well, for some folks
who live on

09:30.320 --> 09:31.822
and a below the poverty line,
the dollar menu

09:31.822 --> 09:33.740
is all they can afford.
Don't knock it.

09:33.740 --> 09:36.118
Oh, no, I wasn't. The spicy
chicken sandwich goes hard.

09:36.118 --> 09:38.704
And I appreciate the apple
slice option in Happy Meals.

09:38.704 --> 09:40.664
But the point
that I was making

09:40.664 --> 09:42.374
is, many low-income families

09:42.374 --> 09:45.085
depend on public schools,
of which I am a product.

09:45.085 --> 09:47.004
- As am I.
- And I would like to add

09:47.004 --> 09:49.256
that I was fortunate enough
to attend a private school.

09:49.256 --> 09:50.465
Hey, hold on, apple slice.

09:50.465 --> 09:51.925
So then, you should extra know

09:51.925 --> 09:54.094
that charters rob funding
from the public school system.

09:54.094 --> 09:55.470
The same
school-to-prison system

09:55.470 --> 09:57.973
that gives zero fucks about
Black and brown boys like me.

09:57.973 --> 09:59.558
Precisely why I'm fundraising

09:59.558 --> 10:01.810
to start my own charter school
in Harlem.

10:01.810 --> 10:04.438
To support and uplift
our Black boys.

10:04.438 --> 10:06.606
And what about
our Black girls?

10:06.606 --> 10:07.858
We don't need y'all's support?

10:07.858 --> 10:09.693
I fully support Black girls,

10:09.693 --> 10:11.611
Black women,
and women of color.

10:11.611 --> 10:12.863
That's not what I was saying.

10:12.863 --> 10:14.406
I'm saying that
statistically, Black men...

10:14.406 --> 10:15.657
No!

10:15.657 --> 10:18.076
Why is everything
always about men

10:18.076 --> 10:19.328
and their wants
and their dreams?

10:19.328 --> 10:21.413
What about our dreams?
What about what we want?

10:21.413 --> 10:23.373
You can't just show back up
on my block with a-

10:23.373 --> 10:25.042
with a racist poster
of your restaurant

10:25.042 --> 10:27.377
and a fiancée with an accent,
and expect a warm welcome.

10:27.377 --> 10:29.546
Are we still talking
about charters?

10:29.546 --> 10:30.714
[Kurt]
I would like to say that I also

10:30.714 --> 10:32.632
fully support Black men.

10:32.632 --> 10:34.843
I think now's a good time
to take a little break.

10:34.843 --> 10:36.511
Don't you?

10:36.511 --> 10:37.888
That was good.

10:37.888 --> 10:39.598
In the future,
I'd like my panels

10:39.598 --> 10:42.726
to be
a little less Jerry Springer.

10:42.726 --> 10:44.019
- Right, maybe yeah.
[Dr. Pruitt] Okay.

10:44.019 --> 10:46.480
Go throw some water
on your face

10:46.480 --> 10:49.149
and come to my office
at00 a.m.

10:49.149 --> 10:51.777
tomorrow morning sharp,
and we'll talk about this.

10:51.777 --> 10:54.112
- Okay?
- Okay. Okay.

10:54.112 --> 10:56.365
Okay. This was good...

10:56.365 --> 10:57.949
Thank you.

10:57.949 --> 10:59.743
...till it wasn't.

10:59.743 --> 11:02.829
And then it went right off
the fucking rails.

11:03.205 --> 11:04.748
"Going Harder"]

11:04.748 --> 11:06.291
Right.

11:06.291 --> 11:08.377
[Raphael]

11:13.799 --> 11:15.842
move like andale...

11:15.842 --> 11:17.928
Hi. Can I help you?

11:17.928 --> 11:19.388
Uh, I don't know.

11:19.388 --> 11:21.306
I'm more of a barber
type of lady.

11:21.306 --> 11:23.183
We take every type of lady.

11:23.183 --> 11:26.395
Let me take a look.

11:26.395 --> 11:27.854
Oh, shit.

11:27.854 --> 11:30.315
And I have a major photo shoot,
like huge.

11:30.315 --> 11:32.442
So just a shape-up.

11:32.442 --> 11:34.694
Hit me with a two guard on the
sides and clean up the back.

11:34.694 --> 11:36.738
Well, I can
easily handle that.

11:36.738 --> 11:39.533
But what about
your amazing bouffant on top?

11:39.533 --> 11:41.868
How can we really
make that shine?

11:41.868 --> 11:44.538
Um, I'm just gonna wet it,
throw some conditioner in it,

11:44.538 --> 11:45.622
and let it do
what it's gon' do.

11:45.622 --> 11:46.873
That's how I roll.

11:46.873 --> 11:49.167
But you said it was
for a big photo shoot.

11:49.167 --> 11:51.878
May I suggest a hair steaming

11:51.878 --> 11:54.297
for hydration and blood flow?

11:54.297 --> 11:56.633
We call it "The Paradisio."

11:56.633 --> 11:58.593
A Cece signature.

11:58.593 --> 12:01.263
Mm, The Paradisio
sounds like a lot.

12:01.263 --> 12:02.681
I'll just stick
to the shape-up.

12:02.681 --> 12:04.599
You look like
you're having a hard day.

12:04.599 --> 12:06.935
Indulge yourself.
You deserve it.

12:09.229 --> 12:11.356
All right.

12:11.356 --> 12:13.066
Grease me up.

12:13.066 --> 12:15.694
[sighs] I yelled
at a complete stranger.

12:15.694 --> 12:17.195
And I'm on my fourth biscuit.

12:17.195 --> 12:19.448
Oh, girl.
I told my keys to fuck off

12:19.448 --> 12:20.657
when I couldn't get
the door open.

12:20.657 --> 12:23.452
[Jill]
Teddy, put that shoe back. Now.

12:23.452 --> 12:25.871
[Camille] And here I thought
yelling in Pilates class

12:25.871 --> 12:27.247
was our low for the day.

12:27.247 --> 12:29.958
Men are ruining us.

12:29.958 --> 12:32.043
You know what?

12:32.043 --> 12:33.879
Let's celebrate the solstice.

12:33.879 --> 12:35.922
Let's leave the past behind.

12:35.922 --> 12:37.591
I'm in. How?

12:37.591 --> 12:41.052
We are gonna go
to ridiculous Brittany's

12:41.052 --> 12:43.555
ridiculous night
for a ridiculous...

12:43.555 --> 12:46.099
[Jameson] Well, well, well.
- Shit.

12:46.099 --> 12:47.434
Quinn, I'll call you
right back.

12:47.434 --> 12:49.311
I mean, I did not take you,

12:49.311 --> 12:51.313
you, as the Red Lobster type.

12:51.313 --> 12:52.522
I'm not.

12:52.522 --> 12:55.275
I mean, what non-tourist
eats at Red Lobster?

12:55.275 --> 12:56.526
I had a meeting nearby.

12:56.526 --> 12:58.236
What up, Cammy?

12:58.236 --> 13:01.656
If you wanna move to your usual
booth, it's about to open up.

13:01.656 --> 13:03.909
[quietly] Thanks.
Perfectly timed.

13:03.909 --> 13:07.037
I mean, I ain't judging,
Cammy, but seriously, these-

13:07.037 --> 13:10.415
these cheddar biscuits,
I mean, they speak to my soul.

13:10.415 --> 13:14.503
Right? See, don't even get me
started on the coconut shrimp.

13:14.503 --> 13:15.504
- What?
- Yes.

13:15.504 --> 13:16.546
With that piña colada
dipping sauce?

13:16.546 --> 13:18.173
Yes! Okay, see.

13:18.173 --> 13:19.966
I like to mix mine
with the dragon sauce.

13:19.966 --> 13:21.426
The dragon sauce?
I've never tried that.

13:21.426 --> 13:23.553
Oh, my gosh!
I just changed your life.

13:23.553 --> 13:25.180
- Okay.
- [Camille laughs]

13:27.349 --> 13:31.603
Look, I am sorry if I was
really intense on the panel.

13:31.603 --> 13:33.188
No, never apologize.

13:33.188 --> 13:35.857
There's nothing wrong
with passion.

13:35.857 --> 13:38.026
- Thanks.
- I'm gonna look you up on IG

13:38.026 --> 13:41.196
in case you ever wanna
argue again in person...

13:41.196 --> 13:42.447
over wine.

13:42.489 --> 13:45.408
[techno music]

13:46.868 --> 13:48.119
[Jameson] Think about it.

13:55.126 --> 13:56.461
[Jill] Here.
Play with mommy's phone.

13:56.461 --> 13:57.587
We're almost done.

13:57.587 --> 14:00.423
[Angie] Hey, girl.
What's going on?

14:00.423 --> 14:02.759
Um, Mom can't
control her daughter,

14:02.759 --> 14:06.054
and we are going out tonight
to watch strippers.

14:06.054 --> 14:07.806
Ooh, boys or girls?

14:07.806 --> 14:11.101
Boys, I think.
It's a party.

14:11.101 --> 14:13.937
I have finally realized
that Mr. Right is a lie,

14:13.937 --> 14:16.356
so Camille and I
are looking for Mr. Right Now.

14:16.356 --> 14:20.110
Aw. Hey, well,
welcome to my world.

14:20.110 --> 14:23.196
So, I need to borrow $600
from you ASAP

14:23.196 --> 14:26.283
and I'll pay you back
ASAP...ish.

14:26.283 --> 14:27.576
[Quinn] I thought that
now that you were working,

14:27.576 --> 14:28.702
this was gonna stop.

14:28.702 --> 14:32.163
I need to pay to work.
Fucking union.

14:32.163 --> 14:33.665
But you know,
I'll work it off here.

14:33.665 --> 14:36.793
I'll keep the store open three
extra hours at $200 an hour.

14:36.793 --> 14:38.295
Tempting offer,

14:38.295 --> 14:41.047
but you know I tore up
my mom's check and rent is due.

14:41.047 --> 14:44.551
Well, I need to earn
that $600 somehow.

14:44.551 --> 14:46.386
Quinn, I have to come back.

14:46.386 --> 14:48.305
Teddy's too hyper
to try on clothes.

14:48.305 --> 14:50.140
Aw, I'm sorry, Jill.

14:50.140 --> 14:52.058
I understand.
She seems like a handful today.

14:52.058 --> 14:54.477
She's the worst.
I'm so over it.

14:54.477 --> 14:57.731
I'm totally, totally lost
since my Jamaican nanny quit.

14:57.731 --> 14:59.858
Yeah.
I hate when that happens.

14:59.858 --> 15:02.527
[Jill] I'm desperate for help,
but she has to be Jamaican.

15:02.527 --> 15:05.363
I had a Jamaican nanny
when I grew up, and I miss her.

15:05.363 --> 15:08.908
[Angie affecting accent]
Luk at dat beautiful gyal.

15:08.908 --> 15:10.869
She is your dawta?

15:16.541 --> 15:19.586
Jill McCabe.
Such a pleasure to meet you.

15:19.586 --> 15:20.920
I love your island.

15:20.920 --> 15:24.090
Best cornrows I ever had.

15:24.090 --> 15:26.509
Do enuh anyone luk

15:26.509 --> 15:29.179
I think I heard "nanny."

[chuckles]
Oh, I love you already.

15:39.689 --> 15:42.817
Don't you love her already?
Teddy?

15:42.817 --> 15:44.069
Can you come to my house

15:44.069 --> 15:46.154
for an interview
and trial time with Teddy?

15:46.154 --> 15:47.864
Sure can.

15:47.864 --> 15:49.658
For $600.

15:49.658 --> 15:52.452

15:56.373 --> 16:00.210
Mi poppa was just like

16:00.210 --> 16:02.212
An' he rolled uhway.

16:02.212 --> 16:03.546
Bless your heart.

16:03.546 --> 16:06.883
No clue what you're saying,
but maybe we could call it

16:06.883 --> 16:08.843
a salary advance if I hire you?

16:08.843 --> 16:10.136
$600, it is.

16:10.136 --> 16:12.847
Here's my name,
number, address.

16:12.847 --> 16:15.725
And I will see you tomorrow

16:15.725 --> 16:16.851
- See yuh, miss.
- Bye.

16:16.851 --> 16:18.937
Bye-bye, Teddy.

16:18.937 --> 16:21.648
Oh, she's so sweet.
I can tell.

16:21.648 --> 16:24.109
- Bye, Jill.
[Jill] Bye.

16:24.109 --> 16:25.568
There's something wrong
with that girl.

16:25.568 --> 16:27.529
No, there's something wrong
with you. Okay.

16:27.529 --> 16:30.115
Pretending to be an immigrant
so that you could get a job?

16:30.115 --> 16:31.991
That is a new low for you.

16:31.991 --> 16:33.702
A new low, or low-key brilliant

16:33.702 --> 16:35.662
that I'm hustling
that problematic white lady

16:35.662 --> 16:36.705
out of some coins?

16:36.705 --> 16:38.164
It is reparations.

16:38.164 --> 16:40.333
It's cultural appropriation.
And being Jamaican myself...

16:40.333 --> 16:42.502
- Half.
- So?

16:42.502 --> 16:44.087
And the other half
is Caymanian, bitch.

16:44.087 --> 16:46.423
So being a full
West Indian person...

16:46.423 --> 16:48.258
Girl, you moved here
when you were four.

16:48.258 --> 16:51.052
Tell that
to my Caribbean ancestors.

16:51.052 --> 16:53.930
The point is, you can't just
put on a Caribbean accent

16:53.930 --> 16:55.974
like it's a cute accessory
and then profit off of it.

16:55.974 --> 16:58.810
It's wrong.
But since we're here,

16:58.810 --> 17:00.437
let me tell you something,
okay?

17:00.437 --> 17:04.107
West Indians are a beautifully
complex and diverse people

17:04.107 --> 17:06.443
whose cultural influence
should be celebrated,

17:06.443 --> 17:09.654
not mocked, especially
by fellow diasporians.

17:09.654 --> 17:13.241
And certainly when you can't
even get the accent right.

17:13.241 --> 17:15.827
Damn, Quinn.
I hear you.

17:15.827 --> 17:17.412
Thank you.

17:17.412 --> 17:19.539
But if you not gwan
gih the gul $600,

17:19.539 --> 17:22.459
mi gwan have tuh do
wha mi gwan have tuh do.

17:22.459 --> 17:23.543
Bomboclaat.

17:23.543 --> 17:25.795
And do like your musical.
Get out.

17:25.795 --> 17:27.589
Bombo. Bombo.

17:27.589 --> 17:29.758
- [laughter]
[Angie] Love you.

17:32.051 --> 17:33.553
[Isabela]
I hope to bring attention

17:33.553 --> 17:35.221
to the way
that polluted environments

17:35.221 --> 17:37.056
disproportionately affect
Black and brown communities.

17:37.056 --> 17:41.728
Hmm, Paradisio
is pretty good.

17:41.728 --> 17:43.855
[sizzling]

17:43.855 --> 17:46.399
[Isabela] Giving our children
a safe and clean place

17:46.399 --> 17:48.860
to play should not be seen
as a radical agenda.

17:48.860 --> 17:50.195
And the only way to make
that clear

17:50.195 --> 17:51.279
to those in Washington...

17:51.279 --> 17:53.281
Oh! He-hello.

17:53.281 --> 17:56.451
Ca-can someone help?

17:56.451 --> 18:00.830
This conditioner
fucking stinks!

18:00.830 --> 18:03.875
[upbeat music]

18:03.875 --> 18:05.210
Fuck love!

18:05.210 --> 18:07.879
Yes, girls!
Let's do this!

18:07.879 --> 18:09.589
We're free.

18:09.589 --> 18:11.758
Whoo!

18:11.758 --> 18:13.885
Okay, darlings,
I rarely say this,

18:13.885 --> 18:15.720
but maybe this is too ratchet.

18:15.720 --> 18:18.139
No. No, no, no.
Not for me.

18:18.139 --> 18:20.225
Not tonight.

18:20.225 --> 18:22.268
That Jameson slid into my DMs.

18:22.268 --> 18:24.395
Camille, no work tonight.
Okay?

18:24.395 --> 18:26.189
This whole solstice thing
was your idea.

18:26.189 --> 18:27.607
- Right.
- So come on.

18:27.607 --> 18:31.569
Let's loosen up
and have some fun, hos.

18:31.569 --> 18:34.948
- She on one.
- I ain't been a ho since 2005.

18:36.574 --> 18:37.992
[Quinn] Yes!

18:37.992 --> 18:40.328
Let us see that
transversus abdominus, honey.

18:40.328 --> 18:41.454
What?

18:41.454 --> 18:43.373
Oh, the "V"
that points to the "D."

18:43.373 --> 18:45.041
- Oh.
- [women howling]

18:45.041 --> 18:47.460
Somehow this isn't making me
feel as good about the future

18:47.460 --> 18:49.170
as I thought it would.

18:49.170 --> 18:51.506
[Camille] Hey.
[Angie] Hey, bitch.

18:51.506 --> 18:55.176
[women hollering]

18:55.176 --> 18:56.803
- Oh.
- Ooh!

18:56.803 --> 18:59.639
Business 101, asshole:

18:59.639 --> 19:01.391
know your audience.

19:01.391 --> 19:03.268
- [all gasp]
- [stripper] Oh, shit!

19:03.268 --> 19:04.936
Don King?

19:04.936 --> 19:07.856
Oh, my God.
Tye, what happened?

19:07.856 --> 19:10.358
Cece. Cece fucking happened.

19:10.358 --> 19:12.402
Cece,
as in Natural Hair Cece's?

19:12.402 --> 19:14.028
[both gasp]
- I'm so pissed!

19:14.028 --> 19:15.613
I mean, I got
a photo shoot tomorrow,

19:15.613 --> 19:18.366
and now I look like
I got ran over by a unicyclist.

19:18.366 --> 19:21.369
Girl, don't even trip.
You know I got you.

19:21.369 --> 19:23.913
Tye, say hello to "Trina."

19:23.913 --> 19:28.167
She's my ever-present "in case
of emergency" and your new BFF.

19:28.167 --> 19:29.252
[Tye] Okay.
- Wait.

19:29.252 --> 19:30.461
Do you have that
with you all the time?

19:30.461 --> 19:32.338
- All the time.
- All the time.

19:32.338 --> 19:35.633
[announcer] And now, what
we've all been waiting for,

19:35.633 --> 19:38.553
Oscar De La Dick-You-Down!

19:39.679 --> 19:42.557
[Jeremih]

19:42.557 --> 19:46.185
you want to ride out...

19:46.185 --> 19:47.562
[women hollering]

19:47.562 --> 19:49.022
[Camille]
Wait a second.

19:49.022 --> 19:50.732
He looks like this guy
named Bobby

19:50.732 --> 19:52.233
I used to date in high school.

19:52.233 --> 19:54.027
Girl, I wish
I went to your school.

19:54.027 --> 19:56.446
[scoffs] He had
an annoying cousin Skeeter.

19:56.446 --> 19:58.990
- Whoo!
- Oh!

19:58.990 --> 20:01.784
- [all scream]
- Ha-ha! I caught that shit.

20:03.703 --> 20:05.079
[Angie] Ooh, yes!

20:05.079 --> 20:07.415
All right, ladies.
Who wants some?

20:07.415 --> 20:08.583
- Not me.
- Me.

20:08.583 --> 20:11.419
- Me!
- [women cheering]

20:11.419 --> 20:12.837
[Camille] Oh!
- Come get this, bitch!

20:23.222 --> 20:24.474
Yeah!

20:26.225 --> 20:27.644
[women hollering]

20:30.813 --> 20:32.106
- Oh!
[Camille] Oh!

20:32.106 --> 20:34.609
Oh, it was in my mouth.
It was in my mouth.

20:34.609 --> 20:36.110
Yeah... ooh, okay.

20:36.110 --> 20:38.321
Yeah, um, y'all,
I'm gonna go ahead and call it.

20:38.321 --> 20:40.198
- Oh, you wack!
- What?

20:40.198 --> 20:41.991
You were the one
that brought us here.

20:41.991 --> 20:44.702
I know, but I have a00 a.m.
with Dr. Pruitt in the morning.

20:44.702 --> 20:45.870
[Tye exhales sharply]
- I got to go.

20:45.870 --> 20:48.498
- Good luck, girl.
- Thank you.

20:48.498 --> 20:49.999
- Love you.
- I love you too.

20:51.501 --> 20:53.753
Quinn.

20:53.753 --> 20:55.129
[squeals, then giggles]

20:55.129 --> 20:57.507
- [mouths]
- No. I know, I know.

20:57.507 --> 20:59.008
Oh! Hi. Okay...

20:59.008 --> 21:01.886
[women hollering]

21:06.766 --> 21:08.226
- Hey.
- Hi.

21:08.226 --> 21:10.812
Hello.
More stripper talk, please.

21:10.812 --> 21:14.148
You have a beautiful smile.

21:14.148 --> 21:15.525
Thanks.

21:15.525 --> 21:17.610
Thank you, Oscar de la...

21:17.610 --> 21:19.237
Shawn.

21:19.237 --> 21:21.197
[voice cracks]
Oscar de la Shawn.

21:21.197 --> 21:23.032
[squealing]

21:26.452 --> 21:28.705
[rasping]
Bye, bitches!

21:28.705 --> 21:30.164
That ain't even fair.

21:30.164 --> 21:33.167
"Forget Me"]

21:42.385 --> 21:45.346
[Journey]

21:48.057 --> 21:49.475
[notification chimes]

21:56.858 --> 21:59.694
'cause you was broken...

21:59.694 --> 22:01.946
Oh. Glad you texted.

22:01.946 --> 22:03.364
I had a feeling you might.

22:03.364 --> 22:06.617
Well, then the joke's on you,
because I butt texted.

22:06.617 --> 22:08.119
I just didn't want
to leave you hanging.

22:08.119 --> 22:09.537
Uh-huh.

22:09.537 --> 22:12.582
So we didn't vibe earlier?

22:12.582 --> 22:14.292
There was a vibe.

22:14.292 --> 22:15.460
Vibe adjacent.

22:15.460 --> 22:16.586
Vibe adjacent?

22:16.586 --> 22:18.171
[chuckles]

22:18.171 --> 22:21.007
So are we just gonna stand
out here and freeze all night,

22:21.007 --> 22:22.008
or is there a plan?

22:22.008 --> 22:24.343
Plan?
Where's the fun in that?

22:24.343 --> 22:26.012
Come on.
Look around us.

22:26.012 --> 22:28.139
Million possibilities,
you know?

22:28.139 --> 22:29.766
Let's have one of those

22:29.766 --> 22:31.517
"only-in-New-York"
kind of nights.

22:31.517 --> 22:33.436
Oh, yeah.
Last time I had one of those,

22:33.436 --> 22:35.563
I was 21,
and I ended up in the back

22:35.563 --> 22:37.982
of Trick Daddy's tour bus
in Atlantic City.

22:37.982 --> 22:39.484
But it was memorable, right?

22:39.484 --> 22:41.319
For Angie, it was.

22:41.319 --> 22:43.571
That's my friend.
You never met her.

22:43.571 --> 22:46.032
Well, I thought we could
check this place out.

22:48.951 --> 22:50.244
This place?

22:50.244 --> 22:52.080
- Yeah. Come on.
- But--

22:55.333 --> 22:57.376
Okay, if this is
an elaborate plan

22:57.376 --> 22:59.879
to get me to do your laundry,
I'm gonna kill you.

22:59.879 --> 23:01.005
[chuckles]

23:03.883 --> 23:05.176
After you.

23:12.558 --> 23:14.352
Oh, my God.

23:14.352 --> 23:17.230
[gasps]
Has this always been here?

23:17.230 --> 23:20.233
I thought I knew
every secret spot in Harlem.

23:20.233 --> 23:22.860
- I told you to trust me.
- Oh, my gosh.

23:22.860 --> 23:26.405
It's the 1979 original version
of Asteroids.

23:26.405 --> 23:27.532
This cannot be real.

23:27.532 --> 23:29.867
Damn, it's like that.
You know the year?

23:29.867 --> 23:32.203
Centipede!

23:32.203 --> 23:34.539
Wow. You really like
video games, huh?

23:34.539 --> 23:37.792
Yeah.
I was a total latchkey kid.

23:37.792 --> 23:40.837
When my mom was at work, I used
to spend hours at two places:

23:40.837 --> 23:43.172
the public library
and this arcade

23:43.172 --> 23:44.882
a few blocks away
from our apartment.

23:44.882 --> 23:46.259
Single mom, huh?

23:46.259 --> 23:47.969
Yeah. Cliché, cliché.

23:47.969 --> 23:50.096
You know, I hate to brag,

23:50.096 --> 23:52.515
but I was kind of like
the neighborhood champ.

23:52.515 --> 23:53.850
Well, I don't know which
neighborhood you grew up in,

23:53.850 --> 23:55.017
'cause you weren't better
than me.

23:55.017 --> 23:56.561
- Oh, is that a challenge?
- Challenge?

23:56.561 --> 23:58.980
No. No, no. I mean, yeah.
It's a challenge, if you want.

23:58.980 --> 24:00.356
- Is it?
- Let's see what you got.

24:00.356 --> 24:01.983
I'm just saying, 'cause if it
is, you know what I'm saying,

24:01.983 --> 24:03.526
you done messed up.
Hold that.

24:03.526 --> 24:04.777
Ooh. This is the money
you gonna owe me later?

24:04.777 --> 24:06.445
Oh, yes.

24:06.445 --> 24:07.697
[Jameson] Whoa!
[Camille] Wow.

24:07.697 --> 24:08.865
- That's crazy, huh?
- Damn!

24:08.865 --> 24:10.449
-Are you impressed?
- Let me show you

24:10.449 --> 24:12.326
what a real champion
looks like, all right?

24:12.326 --> 24:14.203
Okay, let's see.

24:14.203 --> 24:16.372
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

24:16.372 --> 24:18.374
- Oh, and I still got it.
- Wow.

24:18.374 --> 24:20.585
Okay. You do-you do got it.
That's for sure.

24:20.585 --> 24:22.170
No. Stop it.

24:22.170 --> 24:24.338
- Okay... oh!
- [sighs]

24:24.338 --> 24:25.715
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

24:25.715 --> 24:28.426
Whoa.
[both] Oh!

24:28.426 --> 24:31.304
- And-and stop. Don't!
- Uh-uh. Uh-uh.

24:31.304 --> 24:33.055
I know you like her a lot,
but she's not...

24:33.055 --> 24:34.640
- Let me try another one.
- Go for it.

24:34.640 --> 24:36.601
- Ooh.
- Yes!

24:36.601 --> 24:39.687
It's the night of my life!

24:39.687 --> 24:41.314
[squeals]

24:41.314 --> 24:44.108
City with the best cheesecake.

24:44.108 --> 24:45.526
[both] New York.

24:45.526 --> 24:48.362
- Same answer again?
- This is freaky.

24:48.362 --> 24:50.781
Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.

24:50.781 --> 24:53.409
How about your favorite color?

24:53.409 --> 24:54.911
- Red.
- Red.

24:54.911 --> 24:58.206
Look, I feel kinda corny,

24:58.206 --> 24:59.498
but I'm digging this.

25:02.543 --> 25:05.796
No, no, I can't do this.
No, no, no.

25:05.796 --> 25:07.256
- You can't do what?
- This.

25:07.256 --> 25:09.217
The flirty
back-and-forth thing.

25:09.217 --> 25:11.302
But, no, I have decided

25:11.302 --> 25:13.930
that I will no longer look
for a good guy.

25:13.930 --> 25:15.223
Yeah, but I am
a good guy, though.

25:15.223 --> 25:16.140
You are?

25:16.140 --> 25:17.558
Yeah.

25:17.558 --> 25:19.727
No. No.

25:19.727 --> 25:21.979
Uh-uh.
We're not doing this.

25:21.979 --> 25:24.482
The, uh, cutesy,
romantic portion

25:24.482 --> 25:26.692
of the evening has ended.

25:26.692 --> 25:28.611
Okay. I understand.

25:28.611 --> 25:31.155
However, the...

25:31.155 --> 25:35.326
sexy, fucking part
is about to begin.

25:35.326 --> 25:37.745
What do you say?

25:37.745 --> 25:41.290
Your place.
No strings.

25:41.290 --> 25:43.334
I dig that too.

25:43.334 --> 25:45.294
[singer]

25:47.255 --> 25:49.632
[Jameson] Oh, no way
that was Wesley Snipes.

25:49.632 --> 25:50.967
[Camille] That was definitely
Wesley Snipes.

25:50.967 --> 25:53.177
- You are out of your mind.
- Are you serious?

25:53.177 --> 25:54.262
Why would he be on the subway?

25:54.262 --> 25:55.513
I don't know,

25:55.513 --> 25:56.931
but it definitely
looked like Wesley Snipes.

25:56.931 --> 25:58.140
Yo, check this out.

25:58.140 --> 26:00.184
This is-this is why
I love New York winters.

26:00.184 --> 26:03.854
Mm, yeah.
My hands are frozen.

26:03.854 --> 26:05.231
And I'm more of

26:05.231 --> 26:07.316
a New York-in-the-summer kind
of gal.

26:07.316 --> 26:11.153
New York in the summer?
Way too hot and muggy.

26:11.153 --> 26:14.031
You're thinking summer days.
I'm talking summer nights.

26:14.031 --> 26:15.324
Oh.

26:15.324 --> 26:18.911
Swanky rooftop,
fancy cocktail on your hand,

26:18.911 --> 26:20.621
view of the whole city in front
of you...

26:20.621 --> 26:21.998
Nothing beats that.

26:21.998 --> 26:23.582
Plus I'm a summer baby anyway.

26:23.582 --> 26:26.627
Mm, Gemini?

26:26.627 --> 26:29.380
Wait, that was crazy.
How did you do that?

26:29.380 --> 26:30.923
Look, I could sense all that
Gemini energy in today's panel.

26:30.923 --> 26:32.550
- What?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

26:32.550 --> 26:33.926
Y'all can get pretty wild.

26:33.926 --> 26:37.013
Oh, well, not that wild.
I was supposed to be out

26:37.013 --> 26:39.223
with my girlfriends tonight
at a strip club,

26:39.223 --> 26:40.725
hooking up with a guy
I just met,

26:40.725 --> 26:42.935
but I'm here with you, so...

26:42.935 --> 26:44.395
Oh.

26:44.395 --> 26:47.857
Well, we just met.

26:47.857 --> 26:50.109
Yeah, we did just meet.

26:53.029 --> 26:56.032
"Just Enough"]

27:07.209 --> 27:11.005
[Symphani]

27:44.955 --> 27:49.126
you'll love me...

27:49.126 --> 27:51.962
This is Peter.
He's my favorite.

27:51.962 --> 27:54.757
This is Judas.
I hate him.

27:54.757 --> 27:56.592
And this is Jesus.

27:56.592 --> 27:58.761
Oh, hello, Jesus.

27:58.761 --> 28:00.429
She turned all
her American Girl dolls

28:00.429 --> 28:02.640
into Bible characters.

28:02.640 --> 28:05.226
Twelve grand worth
of collectibles.

28:05.226 --> 28:06.727
[whispers]
Fucking shoot me.

28:06.727 --> 28:10.731
I, uh, did not know
your family was so religified.

28:10.731 --> 28:11.857
Just me.

28:11.857 --> 28:13.734
Mommy and Daddy
are going to hell.

28:13.734 --> 28:15.486
[Jill] So you're from Trelawny?

28:15.486 --> 28:17.696
I've never been to that part
of the island. What's it like?

28:17.696 --> 28:19.824
Uh, art.

28:19.824 --> 28:22.034
Flat and nea' the wata.

28:22.034 --> 28:24.245
Aw, I love Jamaica,

28:24.245 --> 28:27.998
but I do have strict rules
about marijuana in my house.

28:27.998 --> 28:29.875
First rule,
you have to share it with me.

28:29.875 --> 28:31.252
I'm just kidding.
I don't...

28:31.252 --> 28:32.711
[whispers]
I am not kidding. I'm not.

28:32.711 --> 28:37.133
Oh, mi love Gawd too
and mi read Bible all day long.

28:37.133 --> 28:39.301
- I love her, Mommy.
- [Jill] Oh, yay!

28:39.301 --> 28:41.595
Aw, she's so happy.
I guess you're hired.

28:41.595 --> 28:43.347
[laughs nervously]
Yay.

28:43.347 --> 28:46.308
You know what? You remind me
so much of Viola Davis.

28:46.308 --> 28:48.519
I love her.
Don't you just love her?

28:48.519 --> 28:50.646
So much.

28:50.646 --> 28:52.273
Well, I don't know.

28:52.273 --> 28:53.983
I don't wanna spoil your fun.

28:53.983 --> 28:57.319
So I should probably run a
few errands and...I don't know.

28:57.319 --> 28:59.488
I'll see you in,
like, five or six hours.

28:59.488 --> 29:01.490
[normally]
Okay. The dolly shit is okay,

29:01.490 --> 29:03.576
but your mom's
racist bullshit is not.

29:03.576 --> 29:05.369
All dark-skinned women
do not look the same,

29:05.369 --> 29:07.955
and we are not here just
to take care of white kids.

29:07.955 --> 29:09.790
Where did your accent go?

29:09.790 --> 29:12.585
Hush chile, you talk too much
like ya damn matha.

29:12.585 --> 29:14.795
More tea.

29:14.795 --> 29:16.839
I am not my hair.

29:16.839 --> 29:20.009
My hair doesn't define me.

29:20.009 --> 29:21.969
I am not my hair.

29:21.969 --> 29:26.682
My hair doesn't define me.

29:26.682 --> 29:28.642
[Anna] Knock, knock.
[Tye] Hi.

29:28.642 --> 29:31.645
[Anna] Hey, stranger.
You owe me a date.

29:31.645 --> 29:34.773
I was hoping you'd be here,

29:34.773 --> 29:37.985
but also sorta hoping
you wouldn't be.

29:37.985 --> 29:40.196
Well, I was wondering
what was taking so long,

29:40.196 --> 29:43.032
and...now I see.

29:43.032 --> 29:44.366
Trust me,

29:44.366 --> 29:48.871
what's going on underneath here
is way worse.

29:48.871 --> 29:53.375
I tried to fix a mistake,
and I think I went too far.

29:56.253 --> 29:57.296
You wanna show me?

30:01.550 --> 30:02.801
[sighs]

30:09.975 --> 30:11.060
And?

30:11.060 --> 30:13.562
Fucking flawless.

30:13.562 --> 30:14.980
Now I really want that date.

30:14.980 --> 30:17.983
[laughter]

30:18.317 --> 30:21.320
[energetic music]

30:31.956 --> 30:33.624
[sighs]

30:37.753 --> 30:40.130
Jameson.

30:40.130 --> 30:43.175
Oh, rise and shine,
sleepyhead.

30:45.553 --> 30:47.388
What time is it?

30:47.388 --> 30:49.640
Uh,15.

30:49.640 --> 30:51.600
Come to my office
at00 a.m.

30:51.600 --> 30:54.979
tomorrow morning sharp,
and we'll talk about this.

30:54.979 --> 30:56.939
What?

30:56.939 --> 30:59.233
No. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.

30:59.233 --> 31:00.776
- I missed my meeting.
[Jameson] Oh, shit.

31:00.776 --> 31:01.610
I didn't know you had
a meeting.

31:01.610 --> 31:02.987
Fuck!

31:02.987 --> 31:04.697
And when the solstice
celebrations end...

31:04.697 --> 31:06.949
I need to use your laptop.
My phone died.

31:06.949 --> 31:08.284
I need to email Dr. Pruitt.

31:08.284 --> 31:11.036
...and the longest night
rolls into day,

31:11.036 --> 31:14.164
sometimes the fresh start
you thought you were getting

31:14.164 --> 31:16.792
turns out to be
something very different.

31:18.794 --> 31:22.214
Wait, wait, wait.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

31:22.214 --> 31:24.341
[Camille] Oh, my God.

31:24.341 --> 31:25.551
What is this?

31:27.344 --> 31:29.013
I can explain.

31:29.013 --> 31:32.641
[Fana Hues]

32:32.660 --> 32:35.412
never ever give
