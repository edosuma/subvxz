Previously onSEAL Team...[guard speaking Arabic]

00:16.625 --> 00:17.626
Hey!

00:17.669 --> 00:18.583
NAIMA:
Ray.

00:18.627 --> 00:20.063
Raymond!Hey, I told you...

00:20.107 --> 00:23.066
Raymond. Please.
You're scaring her.

00:23.110 --> 00:25.112
MINA:
Nice to finally meet you,
Warrant Officer Perry.

00:25.155 --> 00:27.070
Excited to be working
with you, Mina.

00:27.114 --> 00:29.072
SONNY:
See, I did not join the Navy

00:29.116 --> 00:30.334
to end up on a damn ship.

00:30.378 --> 00:32.032
You are gonna make
a great father

00:32.075 --> 00:33.163
to our little girl.

00:33.207 --> 00:35.122
Wow, it's, it's a girl.

00:35.165 --> 00:37.080
THEO:
All that baggage
that comes from war,

00:37.124 --> 00:39.343
it just doesn't go away.

00:39.387 --> 00:41.824
If you really want to
protect your brothers,

00:41.867 --> 00:44.914
you can't just be their sheepdog
when you're downrange.

00:44.957 --> 00:46.829
Yeah.

00:50.659 --> 00:53.009
[metal creaking]

00:57.318 --> 00:59.320
[grunting softly]

01:12.333 --> 01:13.682
[grunts]

01:21.298 --> 01:23.257
[knocking on door]

01:23.300 --> 01:25.085
Anyone up?

01:40.056 --> 01:42.014
Hey, man.

01:42.058 --> 01:43.364
Shouldn't be in here.

01:44.452 --> 01:46.149
Hey, you hear me?

01:57.769 --> 01:59.771
Zied?

01:59.815 --> 02:01.295
Please, sit.

02:02.905 --> 02:05.690
We've got a lot
to catch up on.

02:05.734 --> 02:07.170
Your brothers,
they came for you.

02:07.214 --> 02:08.824
It was too late for me,

02:08.867 --> 02:11.392
but you got to go home
to your family.

02:11.435 --> 02:13.698
And then, would you believe it,
you got to hurt

02:13.742 --> 02:17.702
the man who hurt you.

02:17.746 --> 02:23.055
I-I'm sorry you didn't
get to go home and I did.

02:23.099 --> 02:26.102
At least one of us
got the happy ending.

02:27.799 --> 02:29.105
So why aren't you happy?

02:30.759 --> 02:31.977
You can have this, too.

02:44.294 --> 02:45.774
Eat, Ray.
We both know

02:45.817 --> 02:47.167
you're still starving.

02:47.210 --> 02:49.169
[Ray gasping]

02:51.867 --> 02:53.869
[panting]

02:58.439 --> 03:00.441
â™ª

03:11.887 --> 03:13.976
Where the hell have you been?

03:14.019 --> 03:16.108
The ship store's like
a Black Friday war zone, man.

03:16.152 --> 03:17.458
[chuckles]Had to beat the, uh,
had to beat the crowd.

03:18.502 --> 03:21.201
Brock, here you go.

03:21.244 --> 03:24.116
Oh.
Ginger ale
and enough Dramamine

03:24.160 --> 03:26.771
that you won't feel motion
till you're 80.

03:26.815 --> 03:28.295
And then, Trent,

03:28.338 --> 03:30.122
little nectar of
the hypochondriacs.

03:30.166 --> 03:32.168
TRENT: Nice. Yeah, well,
Sonny's wrong about sharks.

03:32.212 --> 03:34.779
Scurvy's the real
killer out here.

03:34.823 --> 03:36.433
What do you got, a journal
for everyone's problems?

03:36.477 --> 03:39.393
The way we've been on top
of each other this last week?

03:39.436 --> 03:41.264
Couldn't ignore these guys'
issues if I wanted to.

03:41.308 --> 03:42.526
[whistle blows in distance]

03:42.570 --> 03:45.225
[man speaking indistinctly
over P.A.]

03:45.268 --> 03:46.835
JASON:
Hey.

03:46.878 --> 03:48.271
Rough night
in the penthouse, huh?

03:48.315 --> 03:50.969
Looks like you're operating
on no sleep.

03:51.013 --> 03:54.016
Ship groans and whines,
can't block it out.

03:54.059 --> 03:55.278
Well, officer quarters
ain't no match

03:55.322 --> 03:57.149
for the comforts of home, right?

03:57.193 --> 04:01.110
Huh? How's everyone back there?

04:01.153 --> 04:03.504
Good. Life goes on.Yeah?

04:05.288 --> 04:07.986
You've actually been
talking to them?

04:08.030 --> 04:09.292
What do you mean?

04:09.336 --> 04:10.859
Well, I mean,
I-I didn't get Wi-Fi

04:10.902 --> 04:12.034
or cell signal once
yesterday.

04:13.078 --> 04:14.341
Barely talked to Stella for
five minutes since we got here,

04:14.384 --> 04:15.994
but you've been able
to get through to Naima?

04:18.040 --> 04:21.522
[laughs softly]
I'm just lucky, I guess.

04:21.565 --> 04:24.002
Well, good news is,
we're going top deck today.

04:24.046 --> 04:26.091
That's it, right?
Get some fresh air.What?

04:26.135 --> 04:28.529
Little bit of sunshine for you,
Brocky boy, huh?

04:28.572 --> 04:30.313
[laughs]:
Hit the shooting range?

04:30.357 --> 04:32.315
Where's Quinn?I'll tell you what,
smell those casings,

04:32.359 --> 04:33.838
and shoot our woes...Where's Quinn?

04:33.882 --> 04:35.362
Is there a problem, sir?

04:41.019 --> 04:42.891
SOTO: I just learned
you dropped the ball

04:42.934 --> 04:45.197
as Bravo rep at yesterday's
general quarters meeting.

04:45.241 --> 04:47.069
Failed to book the deck space
for range time,

04:47.112 --> 04:48.418
so we won't be going
topside today.

04:48.462 --> 04:50.246
What the hell, Sonny?

04:50.290 --> 04:51.856
Also learned you sauntered

04:51.900 --> 04:53.293
into that meeting
15 minutes late.

04:53.336 --> 04:55.164
You got something to say?

04:55.207 --> 04:58.036
Well, maybe you just
chose the wrong guy

04:58.080 --> 04:59.951
to be secretary...

04:59.995 --> 05:02.345
sir.Say that again, Petty Officer?

05:02.389 --> 05:04.391
Look, I can handle this.Well, you should have handled
it before it happened.

05:04.434 --> 05:06.044
Shouldn't be news
to you, Master Chief.

05:08.264 --> 05:11.920
Spenser, you're the new
Bravo rep for general quarters.

05:11.963 --> 05:13.965
Copy, sir.

05:17.534 --> 05:19.231
What the hell was that, huh?
You screwed up, you own it.

05:19.275 --> 05:21.277
Right? You don't make it
worse by mouthing off.

05:21.321 --> 05:22.539
What are you,
my guidance counselor?

05:22.583 --> 05:24.149
I thought all
you cared about

05:24.193 --> 05:25.455
was me putting holes in skulls.

05:25.499 --> 05:27.327
Or you just pissed
that this blew back on you?

05:30.939 --> 05:32.375
It's just, you
had one job.

05:32.419 --> 05:34.899
All you had to do was
show up and sit in the meeting.

05:34.943 --> 05:37.380
You should be able
to do something like that.

05:37.424 --> 05:39.251
Well, maybe
you overestimated me.

05:39.295 --> 05:40.949
Seems to be going around lately.

05:40.992 --> 05:43.517
All right, look, is this,
is this about

05:43.560 --> 05:46.128
what's going on back home,
with the baby and all?

05:46.171 --> 05:47.477
I thought-- I thought that
was all squared away, huh?

05:47.521 --> 05:48.913
Did somethingchange?

05:48.957 --> 05:50.915
I could ask you
the same damn thing.

05:50.959 --> 05:51.960
All of a sudden
you're interested

05:52.003 --> 05:53.353
in my personal issues?

05:53.396 --> 05:57.139
You playing shrink,
me playing secretary? Hmm?

05:57.182 --> 05:59.359
It's in neither
one of our lanes.

05:59.402 --> 06:02.144
So why don't you and I just
stick to who we are?

06:05.539 --> 06:06.670
CLAY:
Rats?

06:06.714 --> 06:08.411
The apartment's never had rats.

06:08.455 --> 06:10.457
STELLA [over video]:
Then maybe they're
b-being stealthy

06:10.500 --> 06:12.502
when they know that there's
a trained sniper's around.

06:12.546 --> 06:15.200
I don't know.Did you tell the landlord?

06:15.244 --> 06:16.332
No, you didn't put me
on the lease.

06:16.376 --> 06:17.507
I'm a squatter in my own home.

06:17.551 --> 06:19.944
Rat-infested home.I'm sorry.

06:19.988 --> 06:22.947
Uh, adding you to the lease,
it just...

06:22.991 --> 06:24.427
all kind of fell
through the cracks

06:24.471 --> 06:26.037
'cause I had to blow out
so fast.

06:26.081 --> 06:27.561
Are you sure
you're not just hearing,

06:27.604 --> 06:29.214
like, some-some water
or something...No, no, no, no.

06:29.258 --> 06:31.652
Do not start mansplaining
my paranoid ears,

06:31.695 --> 06:33.262
because so help me...

06:33.305 --> 06:35.307
I will call the landlord.

06:35.351 --> 06:37.309
How's, uh, how's ship life?

06:38.354 --> 06:39.964
I just inherited some menial job

06:40.008 --> 06:41.270
that Sonny couldn't handle.

06:41.313 --> 06:43.315
Honestly? It feels like, lately,

06:43.359 --> 06:46.449
that every Bravo problem
has become my problem.

06:46.493 --> 06:49.321
Our problem.

06:49.365 --> 06:53.108
You know, Jason's trial,
Ray at our place.

06:53.151 --> 06:54.588
Well, maybe it's 'cause
the guys know

06:54.631 --> 06:56.154
that they can rely on you.

06:56.198 --> 06:58.374
Unless they have a rodent issue.

06:58.418 --> 07:01.159
And then... mm.
[chuckles]

07:02.204 --> 07:03.466
Sorry, I know it's late there.

07:03.510 --> 07:05.381
You need to get some sleep.

07:05.425 --> 07:07.427
Can we at least talk
at the same time tomorrow?

07:09.429 --> 07:11.474
I can't. I, uh...

07:11.518 --> 07:13.563
New job has me on the hook
every morning.

07:13.607 --> 07:15.652
All right.

07:15.696 --> 07:18.525
I'll try the landlord.

07:18.568 --> 07:21.179
Please stay safe.
I'll try and do the same, okay?

07:21.223 --> 07:23.660
I love you.Love you.

07:23.704 --> 07:25.227
Bye.

07:34.323 --> 07:35.803
[exhales]

07:56.388 --> 07:57.477
Yo.

07:58.565 --> 08:00.523
Blasting our cares away
on deck would've been nice.

08:00.567 --> 08:03.744
Wish Sonny hadn't
have torpedoed that.

08:03.787 --> 08:06.137
Yeah, you know, something's got
him spinning, that's for sure.

08:06.181 --> 08:08.662
[exhales] Yeah, whatever
it is, he'll, uh,

08:08.705 --> 08:11.055
put it in a box when
it's time to operate.

08:11.099 --> 08:13.144
That's all that matters, right?

08:13.188 --> 08:16.408
Yeah. Hey, look,
I took your advice.

08:16.452 --> 08:18.454
I went and saw Theo.

08:18.498 --> 08:20.500
I bet that meant a lot to him.

08:20.543 --> 08:24.199
Did you know that he was using
pills when he was operating?

08:26.767 --> 08:29.247
I didn't.
He was right there next to me.

08:29.291 --> 08:31.641
[exhales]
That's not Sonny's issue.

08:31.685 --> 08:33.208
Clay would know.

08:33.251 --> 08:34.557
I should know.

08:34.601 --> 08:36.428
Should open my eyes more
around here.

08:38.430 --> 08:41.172
Hey. Don't tell me
Soto's scolding

08:41.216 --> 08:42.434
actually got to you, brother.

08:42.478 --> 08:44.741
No, it's not him.
It's-- it was Theo.

08:44.785 --> 08:47.178
Theo told me
I should be more connected

08:47.222 --> 08:49.485
with my brothers
inside the wire.

08:49.529 --> 08:52.270
You know?[scoffs]

08:52.314 --> 08:54.795
You know Theo's just chattering
from the sidelines, man.

08:54.838 --> 08:56.666
You spend your energy
on everyone's drama

08:56.710 --> 08:58.712
and some other part
of your job will pay.

08:58.755 --> 09:00.801
You know, there's nothing wrong
with trying to evolve.

09:02.324 --> 09:03.760
You know that box

09:03.804 --> 09:05.588
Sonny puts his problem in
when it's go time?

09:05.632 --> 09:07.547
Mm-hmm.

09:07.590 --> 09:09.505
You start opening it and you
don't know what you'll find.

09:11.507 --> 09:13.161
Maybe something you can't work.

09:14.205 --> 09:15.467
Like what?

09:15.511 --> 09:17.121
Just trust me.

09:17.165 --> 09:19.776
No need to switch up what's
gotten you this far, Jace.

09:19.820 --> 09:21.691
You... start hunting
everyone's problems,

09:21.735 --> 09:24.912
and you'll get more
than what you wanted.

09:26.174 --> 09:27.828
[phones ringing, vibrating]

09:29.743 --> 09:30.874
Yo.

09:30.918 --> 09:32.876
CLAY:Please tell us
we caught an op?

09:32.920 --> 09:35.313
Or did Sonny forget
to book that, too?

09:35.357 --> 09:36.793
Oh. Zinger.
We're in luck.

09:36.837 --> 09:38.578
Bravo's good work
last week paid off.

09:38.621 --> 09:39.666
That warlord we helped,

09:39.709 --> 09:41.885
he's still keeping
his end of the deal?

09:41.929 --> 09:43.495
Moussa has confirmed
a time and location

09:43.539 --> 09:46.542
for a defecting Boko Haram
lieutenant, Oruku Atanga,

09:46.586 --> 09:47.891
to come into U.S. custody.

09:47.935 --> 09:49.632
Now, Atanga's position

09:49.676 --> 09:52.330
among Boko leadership
means his cooperation

09:52.374 --> 09:54.594
will give the Agency
an unprecedented opportunity

09:54.637 --> 09:56.291
for intel
on the terrorist group.

09:56.334 --> 09:58.554
This HVT could be the piece
that starts to topple

09:58.598 --> 09:59.903
the entire organization.

09:59.947 --> 10:01.644
Job we were sent here to do.

10:01.688 --> 10:05.300
Bravo Team will rendezvous with
Atanga today at 1500 hours,

10:05.343 --> 10:08.346
in a market area on the
outskirts of Maroua.

10:08.390 --> 10:10.522
Moussa will be there to
ensure a smooth handoff.

10:10.566 --> 10:13.525
Sorry, but who picked
this time and place?

10:13.569 --> 10:16.833
I mean, in public, daytime?
Puts us on our heels.

10:16.877 --> 10:19.357
The asset's defection has to be
carried out under conditions

10:19.401 --> 10:20.663
that make him feel comfortable.

10:20.707 --> 10:22.404
MINA:
Agency insists

10:22.447 --> 10:24.493
Atanga has been
thoroughly vetted.

10:24.536 --> 10:25.668
Even if he's playing fair,
there's plenty of danger

10:25.712 --> 10:26.843
surrounding him.

10:26.887 --> 10:28.540
To start, the
20,000-strong

10:28.584 --> 10:30.630
Boko force that he's betraying.

10:30.673 --> 10:32.806
HVT's definitely gonna have
a bull's-eye on him.

10:32.849 --> 10:34.851
Yeah, one we'll be wearing
the whole time we're with him.

10:42.032 --> 10:43.033
RAY:
Infil's gonna be tricky.

10:43.077 --> 10:44.513
Lots of unfriendly eyes
in the area.

10:44.556 --> 10:46.036
SONNY:
My vote is we helo in
a market

10:46.080 --> 10:48.560
and scoop our Benedict Boko up.

10:48.604 --> 10:50.650
Objective is to stay no-viz,

10:50.693 --> 10:52.695
so Bravo will drive in
using a cover.

10:52.739 --> 10:54.958
Pose as members
of an American NGO

10:55.002 --> 10:57.613
that builds infrastructure
for developing communities.

10:57.657 --> 10:58.919
Uh, these so-called
charity workers,

10:58.962 --> 11:03.140
are they rocking
full kit and rifles?
Negative.

11:03.184 --> 11:05.055
You'll be rolling slick
for the meet.

11:05.099 --> 11:06.753
Daytime, public,
and under-gunned.

11:06.796 --> 11:09.494
Bingo card of sketchy's
filling up.JASON: We can handle it.

11:09.538 --> 11:10.974
It feels like two vehicles
to me.

11:11.018 --> 11:12.802
Ray, Sonny, me,

11:12.846 --> 11:14.064
HVT in the lead.

11:14.108 --> 11:15.892
Rest of the team follows.Right.

11:15.936 --> 11:16.893
SOTO:
Swap Quinn and Spenser.

11:16.937 --> 11:18.416
Excuse me?

11:18.460 --> 11:20.592
Put Spenser up
with you in HVT.[Jason scoffs]

11:20.636 --> 11:22.507
His language skills
could come in handy.

11:22.551 --> 11:25.685
Quinn's in the rear.
Just a shooter.[chuckles]

11:25.728 --> 11:27.817
That's not how I want it.SONNY:
No, no, no, no.

11:27.861 --> 11:28.992
It suits me fine, Jace.

11:30.602 --> 11:32.735
Just a shooter.

11:32.779 --> 11:35.433
He got me pegged.

11:35.477 --> 11:36.739
JASON:
I'll pin the routes.

11:36.783 --> 11:39.046
Clay, Sonny, prep
the contingency cases.

11:39.089 --> 11:40.700
Got it? Roll out at 1100.

11:47.141 --> 11:49.186
Hey, uh, thanks again for
putting general quarters

11:49.230 --> 11:50.884
duty on my plate.Well, you know,

11:50.927 --> 11:52.755
Principal Soto's just
returning everything

11:52.799 --> 11:54.104
to its natural order.

11:54.148 --> 11:55.671
I'm the glue-sniffer kid

11:55.715 --> 11:58.108
in the back of the class,
and you are

11:58.152 --> 12:00.110
the Bravo rep that's
polishing his apples.

12:00.154 --> 12:01.982
That meeting every morning is
a time suck that I don't need.

12:02.025 --> 12:04.158
It's hard enough staying
connected with Stella.

12:04.201 --> 12:05.899
All right, well,
you just need to...

12:05.942 --> 12:08.510
tighten the reins there,
Blond Beauty.

12:08.553 --> 12:09.816
You know, team
guys' relationships

12:09.859 --> 12:11.165
blow up fast enough.

12:11.208 --> 12:13.776
No point in burning
through it all

12:13.820 --> 12:15.169
while you're here.

12:17.519 --> 12:19.129
I'm probably gonna ignore
advice from someone

12:19.173 --> 12:20.957
who just stumbles blindly
into everything.

12:21.001 --> 12:22.698
You got me there.

12:22.742 --> 12:25.135
Blind, and you might as well
add deaf and dumb.

12:27.181 --> 12:30.532
Look, man, the, uh, reason
I was late to that meeting

12:30.575 --> 12:32.882
was, I got an email from
Hannah that she was having

12:32.926 --> 12:34.492
some sort of complications.

12:34.536 --> 12:36.494
She and the baby okay?

12:36.538 --> 12:37.800
Yeah, just no thanks to me.

12:37.844 --> 12:39.802
I was like a damn goat
on Astroturf.

12:39.846 --> 12:42.065
Just no sense of how
to help or comfort her.

12:42.109 --> 12:44.546
The email just got me
so twisted up, I-I...

12:44.589 --> 12:47.679
I blanked on the meeting
and I let Bravo down.

12:47.723 --> 12:49.725
Just a typical Sonny Quinn
soup sandwich.

12:49.769 --> 12:52.554
You could have just
explained all that to Soto.

12:52.597 --> 12:53.990
What, and make more
of a fool of myself?

12:54.034 --> 12:56.036
Be like, "Hey, I'm the one
that started the trash fire,

12:56.079 --> 12:57.559
and that was me
actually trying."

12:57.602 --> 12:58.908
So instead you just
let him think

12:58.952 --> 13:00.823
that you're a dumbass
knuckle-dragger.

13:00.867 --> 13:03.043
Seems pretty clear that's
what everyone already thinks.

13:03.086 --> 13:07.047
I don't know, maybe I should
just stop fighting it.

13:12.226 --> 13:14.228
â™ª

13:17.927 --> 13:22.018
Havoc, this is 1.
We're passing Mercury.

13:22.062 --> 13:23.672
DAVIS [over comm]:
That's a good copy.

13:23.715 --> 13:25.282
You are 15 mikes
to the meeting location.

13:25.326 --> 13:27.632
Havoc out.

13:27.676 --> 13:30.635
Is it wrong to admit that
I'm jealous they got to leave?

13:30.679 --> 13:32.899
[both chuckle]

13:32.942 --> 13:35.640
Yean, not loving life
on board myself.

13:35.684 --> 13:37.164
Lieutenant Davis, how's that
crypto key working out?

13:37.207 --> 13:38.992
There's nothing to report,
Lieutenant Commander Whitshaw.

13:39.035 --> 13:40.036
Okay.

13:57.924 --> 14:00.013
Hey, um...

14:00.056 --> 14:03.016
something going on with
Lieutenant Commander Whitshaw?

14:03.059 --> 14:05.975
Mm, nothing worth discussing.

14:06.019 --> 14:08.848
Okay.

14:08.891 --> 14:10.588
The way you reacted to him,

14:10.632 --> 14:13.635
I'm just wondering
if he's doing to you

14:13.678 --> 14:15.376
what he did to me.

14:18.814 --> 14:19.902
When?

14:19.946 --> 14:22.905
I was fresh enlisted.

14:22.949 --> 14:24.080
He was an ensign.

14:24.124 --> 14:25.821
We had supply detail together.

14:25.865 --> 14:28.780
So at first I thought
he was funny.

14:28.824 --> 14:30.043
You know, charming even.

14:30.086 --> 14:33.089
But then he started
getting more aggressive.

14:33.133 --> 14:35.091
I'd be trying to work,

14:35.135 --> 14:37.920
and he'd be badgering me about
what kind of guy I liked,

14:37.964 --> 14:39.313
what I fantasized about.

14:40.923 --> 14:44.753
I tried to laugh it off,
but it only got uglier.

14:49.149 --> 14:50.802
And here I'd hoped
he'd changed.

14:50.846 --> 14:53.022
It's just talk.For now.

14:53.066 --> 14:54.937
Look, it's sexual harassment.

14:54.981 --> 14:56.808
Same as back then.

14:56.852 --> 14:59.986
And I wish that I had been
brave enough to report him.

15:03.337 --> 15:06.644
But now you're an officer

15:06.688 --> 15:09.386
mandated to put it on paper
if you know of something.

15:13.173 --> 15:15.175
There's nothing to report.

15:15.218 --> 15:17.786
You know, the Navy has
gotten a lot better

15:17.829 --> 15:19.353
about handling...I'm here to do a job,

15:19.396 --> 15:22.138
one I'm damn good at,
and I don't need a distraction.

15:22.182 --> 15:24.880
Nothing to report,
Lieutenant.

15:24.924 --> 15:27.056
Copy.

15:35.369 --> 15:37.937
You know, I realize I shouldn't
agree with Sonny,

15:37.980 --> 15:40.330
but are we sure letting
a mass murderer

15:40.374 --> 15:41.984
call where and when
was a good idea?

15:42.028 --> 15:44.900
JASON:
I'll take an ambush over that
floating asylum any day.

15:46.380 --> 15:47.990
Can't argue with that.

15:48.034 --> 15:49.992
[sat phone beeps]

15:50.036 --> 15:53.300
Go, Moussa.
Mr. Moussa?

15:53.343 --> 15:56.346
Calm down, I-I don't understand.

15:56.390 --> 15:58.827
Sounds like our warlord
is a little rattled.
Yeah.

15:58.870 --> 16:02.309
Boko attacked our HVT at the
meet site, left him for dead.

16:03.353 --> 16:06.182
Yeah. Yeah...

16:06.226 --> 16:08.358
Moussa bugged out when he
heard the ambulance coming.

16:08.402 --> 16:09.969
Okay, yeah.

16:10.012 --> 16:12.058
Have Davis find out where an
ambulance would've taken Atanga.

16:12.101 --> 16:13.711
Havoc, this is 1.

16:13.755 --> 16:15.409
Frag-O. Stand by.

16:17.280 --> 16:19.979
[indistinct chatter]

16:43.872 --> 16:46.396
Whoa, that's our man.

16:46.440 --> 16:48.137
Check.

16:48.181 --> 16:51.010
Can I help you?

16:51.053 --> 16:52.446
Yeah, hi, we're, uh...

16:52.489 --> 16:53.751
we're actually with
an aid organization,

16:53.795 --> 16:55.971
and the gentleman
in this bed here

16:56.015 --> 16:57.929
is an associate of ours,
and we'd like to take him to

16:57.973 --> 17:00.062
our medical facility.

17:00.106 --> 17:02.282
The man in the bed
isn't going anywhere.

17:02.325 --> 17:04.110
He's clinging to life.

17:04.153 --> 17:06.286
Well, we can arrange
for a medevac helo for him.

17:06.329 --> 17:10.420
Asset like that, must be
some aid organization.

17:11.552 --> 17:14.163
All right, look,
the truth is, we're with

17:14.207 --> 17:15.991
the U.S. Department of State,

17:16.035 --> 17:17.427
working in conjunction
with your government.

17:17.471 --> 17:20.300
Whoever you are, the
puncture in his carotid

17:20.343 --> 17:22.171
needs immediate
surgical intervention.

17:22.215 --> 17:23.781
I'm prepping for
that right now.

17:23.825 --> 17:26.175
He cannot be moved.How long?

17:26.219 --> 17:29.439
An hour, a strong dose
of luck, and he's possibly

17:29.483 --> 17:31.180
stable enough to transport.

17:31.224 --> 17:33.269
[speaking indistinctly]

17:33.313 --> 17:35.358
Now what, Jason?

17:35.402 --> 17:38.405
At some point, Boko's gonna
realize he's still alive.

17:38.448 --> 17:40.798
How long till they
come back to finish the job?

17:40.842 --> 17:42.322
We're not going anywhere.

17:51.331 --> 17:53.463
Bravo spending an hour
in an unplanned location

17:53.507 --> 17:55.117
isn't something we should
feel comfortable with.

17:55.161 --> 17:58.425
Yeah, Atanga's presence in the
hospital makes it a target.

17:58.468 --> 18:00.122
And Bravo's presence
attracts suspicion.

18:00.166 --> 18:02.124
If Boko finds out
who's in there with them,

18:02.168 --> 18:03.430
they will not hesitate
to torch the building.

18:03.473 --> 18:05.258
Civilians included.

18:05.301 --> 18:07.477
Navy's medical team agrees
with the doctor's assessment.

18:07.521 --> 18:10.176
It's too risky to transport
Atanga right now.

18:12.178 --> 18:14.484
Jason said they pulled a cell
phone from the HVT's pocket.

18:14.528 --> 18:16.834
It could have intel on it.

18:16.878 --> 18:18.009
Might be best for
Bravo to take it

18:18.053 --> 18:19.141
and exfil.

18:19.185 --> 18:20.229
Agency doesn't want
what's in his phone,

18:20.273 --> 18:21.535
they want what's in his head.

18:21.578 --> 18:24.146
That's the mission.You heard the shape he's in.

18:24.190 --> 18:26.017
Chance he ever says
a word is a long shot

18:26.061 --> 18:28.019
that's costing us more
every minute.

18:28.063 --> 18:30.544
There's no QRF, the
team's got limited gear.

18:30.587 --> 18:32.502
Yeah. Understood.

18:32.546 --> 18:34.243
But we have no indication
that Boko's

18:34.287 --> 18:37.507
even aware that Atanga's
at the hospital.

18:37.551 --> 18:40.119
Bravo will hold position there.

18:48.257 --> 18:50.303
You think she realizes
she's treating a public enemy?

18:50.346 --> 18:52.522
Atanga didn't have an ID.

18:52.566 --> 18:55.960
CLAY:
She seems unfazed.
Probably doesn't know.

18:56.004 --> 18:57.266
Or she knows exactly
what she's dealing with

18:57.310 --> 18:59.094
and just pro enough
to block it out.

18:59.138 --> 19:01.575
Let too much in,
the scalpel gets shaky.

19:03.577 --> 19:06.580
Ready if this gig switches
from acoustic to electric.

19:09.670 --> 19:12.151
[indistinct announcement
over P.A.]

19:24.250 --> 19:25.990
Dig in, boys.

19:33.694 --> 19:37.088
We'll hole up here,
watch the cams,

19:37.132 --> 19:39.134
emerge heavy
if necessary.

19:39.178 --> 19:41.223
Okay. Get your popcorn
ready, friendo.

19:41.267 --> 19:43.225
You have one for me?

19:43.269 --> 19:45.662
[chuckles]
Nice try, buddy.

19:48.448 --> 19:50.972
[indistinct chatter]

20:01.983 --> 20:03.245
[gasps]

20:03.289 --> 20:04.942
Damn it. Bravo 1.

20:04.986 --> 20:07.162
Our guy just got made.

20:07.206 --> 20:09.686
Hey, give me that.
Give me the phone. Now!

20:13.386 --> 20:15.083
She just told someone
he's here.

20:15.126 --> 20:18.129
Word's out.

20:18.173 --> 20:19.130
Why would you do that, huh?

20:19.174 --> 20:21.002
No, hey, Ray, knock it off.

20:21.045 --> 20:22.395
What's going on?

20:22.438 --> 20:24.223
That man is a monster!

20:24.266 --> 20:25.441
A butcher!

20:25.485 --> 20:27.356
We are helping him?!

20:27.400 --> 20:29.140
All right, look.
Doctor? Doctor.

20:29.184 --> 20:31.055
Hey, step back now.

20:31.099 --> 20:32.970
Looks like we're
gonna have company.

20:33.014 --> 20:34.624
Tell everybody, all right?

20:34.668 --> 20:36.713
Roger that.

20:36.757 --> 20:38.715
They realize whose life
they're saving?

20:38.759 --> 20:41.327
I don't think, uh, they're
gonna be saving anyone now.

20:41.370 --> 20:42.458
Listen, Doctor, I understand.

20:42.502 --> 20:44.417
You understand nothing.

20:44.460 --> 20:47.071
My staff knows the horrors
this man has inflicted

20:47.115 --> 20:49.160
against their neighbors,
their friends.

20:49.204 --> 20:50.640
This is my ward,

20:50.684 --> 20:53.556
and I will not ask them
to disregard their feelings.

20:57.081 --> 20:59.170
Hey, I-I bet you treated
patients from,

20:59.214 --> 21:01.303
from Boko's attack on the
farm in Balaza two weeks ago.

21:01.347 --> 21:04.393
And from the massacre in the
Gayak market the month before?

21:04.437 --> 21:07.309
An awful day for all of us.

21:07.353 --> 21:10.225
Look, we know
he's a monster.

21:10.269 --> 21:12.662
Okay, we were sent to bring him
in to find out what he knows

21:12.706 --> 21:14.490
so the next awful
day doesn't happen.

21:14.534 --> 21:16.405
Look, the greater good
sometimes requires

21:16.449 --> 21:18.668
we have to do things
we're not proud of.

21:18.712 --> 21:21.323
We have to keep
Atanga alive.

21:21.367 --> 21:23.020
Mm.

21:23.064 --> 21:25.066
[indistinct chatter]

21:33.248 --> 21:35.032
Okay.

21:35.076 --> 21:37.078
We'll take him in
to operate now.

21:37.121 --> 21:39.646
[indistinct chatter]

21:41.648 --> 21:43.737
[clears throat]

21:43.780 --> 21:46.217
Anything in SIGINT?
Yeah.

21:46.261 --> 21:49.046
Rumors of Atanga being at
that hospital are spreading.

21:49.090 --> 21:51.745
You know, social media,
local news site.

21:53.094 --> 21:55.226
Boko's S.O.P. suggests
they won't wait long

21:55.270 --> 21:57.054
to act on their
unfinished business.

21:57.098 --> 21:59.143
Yeah, I've requested ISR
to get us

21:59.187 --> 22:00.710
a better visual
on the hospital's perimeter,

22:00.754 --> 22:02.408
but that's still
a ways out.

22:03.583 --> 22:05.846
Until then, Bravo's eyes
are all we've got.

22:07.195 --> 22:09.066
[indistinct chatter]

22:09.110 --> 22:10.111
[door opens]

22:11.852 --> 22:13.723
Surgery was successful.

22:13.767 --> 22:15.551
Vitals are improving.

22:15.595 --> 22:17.205
I'll let you know
when he's stable enough

22:17.248 --> 22:18.598
for transport.
Thank you.

22:18.641 --> 22:20.556
Havoc, this is 1. Launch
a medevac to our location.

22:20.600 --> 22:22.384
All right, put it in
a five-minute racetrack.

22:22.428 --> 22:24.430
Doctor?
Hmm?

22:25.692 --> 22:27.389
Ma'am, I, uh...

22:27.433 --> 22:30.740
I just want to apologize
for my outburst earlier.

22:32.481 --> 22:34.614
My wife's an E.R. nurse,
and I get how stressful it is.

22:34.657 --> 22:36.790
Never know
what will land in here.

22:38.139 --> 22:40.141
Wading through blood
and pain all day...

22:40.184 --> 22:42.230
you shouldn't be getting
yelled at on top of it.

22:42.273 --> 22:46.103
Your job's not without its
share of blood and pain, is it?

22:46.147 --> 22:49.498
I don't think I ever said
what my job is exactly.

22:50.804 --> 22:52.806
Didn't need to.

22:53.894 --> 22:56.897
I bet you'd agree,
the blood's not the hard part.

22:58.638 --> 23:00.770
The wounds you can't see are
the hardest to deal with.

23:00.814 --> 23:02.685
As I'm sure your wife knows.

23:03.730 --> 23:05.427
What's that supposed to mean?

23:05.471 --> 23:07.168
Just an observation.

23:07.211 --> 23:08.735
No, but what are you
trying to say?

23:08.778 --> 23:10.476
Lady, you don't know
anything about me.

23:10.519 --> 23:11.825
Okay?

23:15.481 --> 23:17.439
What was that all about?

23:17.483 --> 23:20.137
Talking like she
knows me, knows Naima.

23:20.181 --> 23:22.183
She doesn't know
anything about me.

23:29.799 --> 23:31.714
Everything okay?

23:31.758 --> 23:33.760
Yeah,
excitement never ends.

23:37.241 --> 23:38.678
[speaks indistinctly]

23:43.465 --> 23:44.553
What happened to the little boy?

23:44.597 --> 23:47.251
Struck by a car.

23:47.295 --> 23:49.297
Little boy's a fighter.

23:49.340 --> 23:51.386
He's about to go in
for another surgery.

23:53.214 --> 23:54.563
Hmm.

23:54.607 --> 23:56.652
Is he gonna be okay?

23:56.696 --> 23:59.176
God willing.

23:59.220 --> 24:00.917
Children are resilient.

24:00.961 --> 24:02.832
But I worry
about his father.

24:02.876 --> 24:05.269
By his side day and night.

24:05.313 --> 24:06.880
Doesn't eat,
doesn't sleep.

24:06.923 --> 24:09.273
His job refused
time off, he quit.

24:09.317 --> 24:12.407
Imagine that kind
of devotion.

24:18.326 --> 24:20.850
TRENT:
Bravo 1, Bravo 3,
need you in the security room.

24:20.894 --> 24:22.896
Got a situation.

24:27.683 --> 24:31.382
Fighting-age male down
in the lobby with a machete.

24:31.426 --> 24:33.820
I don't think
he's asking for more Jell-O.

24:33.863 --> 24:35.256
Guys are here for blood.

24:35.299 --> 24:37.301
And not just Atanga's.

24:45.919 --> 24:47.921
[indistinct chatter]

24:50.750 --> 24:52.752
Shh.

25:15.470 --> 25:17.428
Bravo 1, this is 6.

25:17.472 --> 25:19.779
We got three Tangos
down hard in the lobby.

25:20.867 --> 25:22.608
Copy that, Bravo 6.

25:22.651 --> 25:24.261
TRENT:
Another five local inside.

25:24.305 --> 25:26.568
They're splitting up, coming
in from different directions.

25:26.612 --> 25:27.961
Too many. At least we
know what they're after.

25:29.353 --> 25:31.834
Listen, all Bravo elements, tell
people to clear the hallways.

25:31.878 --> 25:34.707
Let's rally outside the O.R.

25:34.750 --> 25:36.578
[panicked chatter, clamoring]

25:36.622 --> 25:38.711
Hey, we got
to clear the hallways.

25:38.754 --> 25:40.713
Get away from the O.R., go!But what is happening?

25:40.756 --> 25:42.584
Go, you got to go, move.

25:42.628 --> 25:44.455
All right, look, we know
they're on their way here,

25:44.499 --> 25:46.283
so, Clay, Sonny, Brock, Metal,

25:46.327 --> 25:47.807
split up, take 'em out
before they get here.

25:47.850 --> 25:50.331
The rest of us
will protect the O.R.

26:20.535 --> 26:22.711
Bravo elements, this is 6.

26:22.755 --> 26:24.800
Got two Tangos down at my pos.

26:24.844 --> 26:26.497
Not too shabby.

26:26.541 --> 26:27.977
I just dropped three over here.

26:28.021 --> 26:29.631
Copy, 3.

26:29.675 --> 26:33.374
Trigger finger's the one
reliable fiber in me.

26:34.941 --> 26:36.943
[indistinct chatter]

26:39.032 --> 26:40.903
Any more movement?

26:40.947 --> 26:42.470
SONNY:
Nothing yet.

26:44.515 --> 26:46.474
Spoke too soon.

26:46.517 --> 26:48.345
These guys are
done playing.

26:48.389 --> 26:50.652
All Bravo elements,
collapse to strongpoint O.R.

26:50.696 --> 26:52.393
How many we looking at?Ten.

26:52.436 --> 26:54.395
Maybe more.Aw, should've brought
my belt-fed.

26:54.438 --> 26:56.353
Look, they're coming in quick,
so get to our position...

26:56.397 --> 26:58.921
SONNY:Who the hell throws
a grenade in a hospital?

Out!

[man shouts]

27:46.926 --> 27:48.884

27:49.929 --> 27:51.844

Hold fire! Hold fire!

27:51.887 --> 27:53.846
Go check the bodies.

27:53.889 --> 27:55.674
Havoc, this is 1.
Building's clear.

27:55.717 --> 27:57.893
HVT is secure at this time.
You have any traffic for us?

27:57.937 --> 27:59.852
Copy, 1. ISR is on station now.

27:59.895 --> 28:01.767
Stand by.

28:01.810 --> 28:03.594
Get our umbrella up just
as the storm's passed.

28:03.638 --> 28:05.596
Well, I don't know if it's
blue skies quite yet.

28:05.640 --> 28:07.598
Got two vehicles parked
in the back of the hospital.

28:07.642 --> 28:08.904
Couple of packs in each.

28:08.948 --> 28:10.601
Yeah, looks like they're
glassing the building.

28:10.645 --> 28:13.604
Could be Boko spotters,
waiting for others to show up.

28:13.648 --> 28:14.736
Yeah, I wonder
what their third run

28:14.780 --> 28:16.477
at this guy's gonna look like.

28:26.966 --> 28:28.794
SONNY:Oh, no.

28:32.493 --> 28:35.104
He was worried
about his son.

28:36.192 --> 28:40.022
I told him to get away
from the O.R. and take cover.

28:40.066 --> 28:41.763
Hey, man.

28:41.807 --> 28:43.722
You did your best.

28:48.509 --> 28:51.077
I'm so sorry.

28:55.516 --> 28:56.778
[door opens][indistinct chatter]

28:56.822 --> 28:57.997
What's going on?

28:58.040 --> 28:59.912
The carotid shunt is thrombosed.

28:59.955 --> 29:02.697
Appears he had a stroke,
some internal hemorrhaging.

29:02.741 --> 29:04.830
Well, then get back in there
and stabilize him.

29:04.873 --> 29:06.483
That requires another operation.

29:06.527 --> 29:07.963
But there are
six people downstairs.

29:08.007 --> 29:09.573
Innocent people,
who were just

29:09.617 --> 29:11.140
gravely injured
in that attack.

29:11.184 --> 29:13.969
Half the staff fled in fear.
They need me down there.

29:14.013 --> 29:16.667
You operate on him first,
then you take care of them.

29:16.711 --> 29:17.930
I understand
the "greater good,"

29:17.973 --> 29:19.583
what Atanga's knowledge
might mean.

29:19.627 --> 29:21.498
But it means nothing to
the people who are bleeding out

29:21.542 --> 29:24.588
right now, means nothing if he
can never speak that knowledge.

29:24.632 --> 29:27.026
His odds of regaining
function are miniscule.

29:27.069 --> 29:29.245
My directive is
to keep him alive.

29:29.289 --> 29:31.117
It's not my choice.

29:31.160 --> 29:33.641
No. It's mychoice.

29:35.730 --> 29:37.732
[indistinct chatter, clamoring]

29:40.604 --> 29:42.650
So is she walking
out of here or what?

29:42.693 --> 29:44.826
We doubled-down this far
on this mudsucker,

29:44.870 --> 29:46.872
and we're just gonna
let her cut bait?

29:46.915 --> 29:48.656
The whole point of this
mess is landing him.

29:48.699 --> 29:50.179
Atanga's on death's door.

29:50.223 --> 29:52.747
We'd be trading six lives
for a Hail Mary.

29:52.791 --> 29:54.618
It ain't algebra, it's a
mission-- we need her to get him

29:54.662 --> 29:57.056
better and then we get
out of here. Simple.

29:57.099 --> 29:59.232
Boko continues running
roughshod in this region,

29:59.275 --> 30:01.103
a lot more than six
people are gonna pay.

30:01.147 --> 30:02.757
Atanga can help with that.

30:02.801 --> 30:04.846
And any chance of that
is hard to throw away.

30:04.890 --> 30:07.762
If anyone can convince
her, it's Bravo 1.

30:17.946 --> 30:20.296
So you do want it
to be your choice?

30:22.951 --> 30:24.823
There's no good call here.

30:24.866 --> 30:28.304
You want to make it,
be my guest.

30:34.615 --> 30:36.617
[sighs]

30:40.229 --> 30:42.057
Bravo's been radio silent
for 20 minutes.

30:42.101 --> 30:44.103
What are they doing?

30:46.279 --> 30:48.150
Bravo 1, this is Havoc.

30:48.194 --> 30:49.935
What's your sitrep?Copy, Havoc.

30:49.978 --> 30:51.980
We're...Heart rate's dropping.

30:52.024 --> 30:53.590
He's coding.

30:53.634 --> 30:55.201
Look, can you save him?There's nothing I can do.

30:55.244 --> 30:57.072
Doctor's in surgery downstairs.

30:57.116 --> 30:59.161
[monitor flatlining]

30:59.205 --> 31:02.121
Bravo 1, come in, over.

31:04.732 --> 31:06.603
Havoc, this is, uh, 1.

31:06.647 --> 31:08.692
Go ahead, 1.

31:10.259 --> 31:13.001
HVT is down hard.
We've lost him.

31:19.747 --> 31:20.966
Best shot
we've ever had at Boko,

31:21.009 --> 31:22.271
and it went right
into the ground.

31:22.315 --> 31:23.794
This op was a tightrope walk
from the outset.

31:23.838 --> 31:26.058
There's nothing that anybody
could've done differently.

31:26.101 --> 31:27.102
Well, we don't know that.

31:27.146 --> 31:28.669
We don't know
what went on in there.

31:28.712 --> 31:30.976
Get them back here,
so Bravo 1 can debrief me.

31:35.328 --> 31:38.635
Bravo, this is Havoc.
Boko trucks are still on site,

31:38.679 --> 31:40.289
but your route is open
to the west of the building.

31:40.333 --> 31:41.900
You're clear to RTB.

31:43.118 --> 31:44.815
Sonny's got the gear packed.

31:44.859 --> 31:47.035
Ready to roll out.
Huh.

31:48.994 --> 31:50.952
You made the right call.

31:50.996 --> 31:52.780
Yeah. Boko's still
out there, though.

31:52.823 --> 31:54.825
Davis said that our route's
clear on the other side.

31:54.869 --> 31:56.697
Enemy won't be a problem.Not for us.

31:56.740 --> 31:58.960
Hospital still has
a bull's-eye on it.

31:59.004 --> 32:01.310
You think the next wave might
still come crashing through.

32:01.354 --> 32:05.010
Look, they don't know he's dead.
Our job's not finished.

32:07.273 --> 32:09.275
[men shouting in distance]

32:11.755 --> 32:14.193
CLAY:
Bravo 6 in position. Over.

32:20.199 --> 32:22.288
On my mark, stand by.

32:22.331 --> 32:23.289
Three,

32:23.332 --> 32:24.812
two, one.

[tires screeching]

32:47.226 --> 32:49.228

32:52.840 --> 32:54.320
They got what they came for.

32:56.104 --> 32:57.236
[tires screeching]

32:57.279 --> 32:59.020
All Bravo elements, this is 1.

32:59.064 --> 33:00.804
Collapse back
to the rally point.

33:13.165 --> 33:14.775
We're RTB.

33:16.081 --> 33:18.083
[woman speaking indistinctly
over P.A.]

33:27.788 --> 33:29.442
Any luck on Atanga's phone?

33:29.485 --> 33:31.183
He may live to tell
Boko's secrets, after all.

33:31.226 --> 33:33.402
Already found
a promising cache of files.

33:33.446 --> 33:36.231
So maybe today
wasn't a complete bust.

33:36.275 --> 33:37.928
Don't break out the champagne.

33:37.972 --> 33:39.452
Objective was to bring in
the man, not his Nokia.

33:39.495 --> 33:41.454
AAR's gonna read failure.

33:41.497 --> 33:45.240
We salvaged what we could
off a snake-bit mission.

33:45.284 --> 33:47.286
Agency's having a hard time
buying there wasn't one moment

33:47.329 --> 33:49.462
HVT was stable enough
to extract.

33:49.505 --> 33:51.377
[scoffs] Well, you know, medical
opinion, that's not my job.

33:51.420 --> 33:53.161
Well, my job
is justifying

33:53.205 --> 33:55.207
the choices that were made, and
I'm still in the dark on that.

33:55.250 --> 33:57.165
Bottom line is...Bottom line

33:57.209 --> 34:00.081
is that we got a lead on
intel and a full head count.

34:00.125 --> 34:02.301
So take the win, 'cause
you're lucky more lives

34:02.344 --> 34:03.824
weren't lost, sir.

34:10.004 --> 34:10.961
DAVIS:
Hey, I hear it's, uh,

34:11.005 --> 34:12.441
taco night.

34:12.485 --> 34:13.790
You want to see what they
got left for the midrats?

34:13.834 --> 34:15.227
Oh, you had me at carbs.
I'm starving.

34:15.270 --> 34:17.098
Hey, you guys grabbing a bite?

34:17.142 --> 34:18.969
Mind if I tag along?

34:19.013 --> 34:21.146
Y-You know what?
I'm just gonna rack out.

34:21.189 --> 34:22.973
Yeah.

34:24.018 --> 34:25.498
Are you still
in, Davis,

34:25.541 --> 34:26.890
now that we lost
our third wheel?

34:26.934 --> 34:29.284
You know what,
I actually have been, um,

34:29.328 --> 34:31.330
meaning to talk to you, uh...

34:33.506 --> 34:34.811
...officer to officer.

34:34.855 --> 34:37.423
Ah, that sounds intriguing.

34:37.466 --> 34:39.294
Your behavior on the ship.

34:39.338 --> 34:40.948
What about my behavior?

34:40.991 --> 34:43.124
You've been making people
uncomfortable.

34:43.168 --> 34:44.299
Uncomfortable?

34:44.343 --> 34:46.040
Well, I know

34:46.084 --> 34:48.129
my sense of humor isn't for
everyone. If I said something...

34:48.173 --> 34:49.261
Yeah, you said a lot

34:49.304 --> 34:51.045
to the women that have
to work with you.

34:51.089 --> 34:52.481
To me.

34:52.525 --> 34:53.874
Back in Guam?

34:53.917 --> 34:55.310
You made every day
hard for me.

34:55.354 --> 34:56.485
Seriously?

34:56.529 --> 34:58.270
Oh, I didn't realize.

34:58.313 --> 35:01.186
You always seemed,
you know, game.

35:01.229 --> 35:03.188
No, this is about your actions,

35:03.231 --> 35:05.886
not about the act that I had to
perform to feel safe around you.

35:06.887 --> 35:08.018
Well, look, I'm sorry.

35:08.062 --> 35:09.411
I had a little
crush on you,

35:09.455 --> 35:12.501
I didn't know
how to handle myself.

35:13.546 --> 35:15.374
Then it ends now.

35:15.417 --> 35:16.984
The harassment. You don't,

35:17.027 --> 35:18.159
you don't treat
anyone on this ship

35:18.203 --> 35:19.291
the way that you treated me.

35:19.334 --> 35:22.163
Yeah, absolutely.

35:22.207 --> 35:24.122
Message received.

35:29.562 --> 35:31.520
Oh, and, Lieutenant Davis,

35:31.564 --> 35:33.522
I appreciate you

35:33.566 --> 35:35.133
coming to me with this.

35:43.010 --> 35:45.012
[slow country song playing]

35:52.541 --> 35:54.891
Hey.

35:54.935 --> 35:56.415
That's some, uh...
[chuckles]

35:56.458 --> 35:59.635
serious uplifting music
you got going on, man.

35:59.679 --> 36:01.898
Tell you what,
you play it backwards,

36:01.942 --> 36:04.423
you get your horse back,
and maybe your truck.

36:04.466 --> 36:06.425
The next track is called
"Waitin' Around to Die."

36:06.468 --> 36:09.341
Usually gets people up dancing.

36:09.384 --> 36:10.559
â™ª

36:10.603 --> 36:12.648
Yeah. Hey.[music stops]

36:12.692 --> 36:15.303
You want to tell me
what your problem is?

36:15.347 --> 36:16.435
Oh, here we go. What, you,

36:16.478 --> 36:18.176
you gonna blame
the failed op on me?

36:18.219 --> 36:19.612
This is not about the op,
man. I just got to make sure

36:19.655 --> 36:21.004
that you're all
squared away here

36:21.048 --> 36:23.355
and when
we get back home.

36:23.398 --> 36:25.052
This is coming from a guy

36:25.095 --> 36:26.662
who told me to keep my eyes
on the sandbox

36:26.706 --> 36:29.709
instead of Texas when Hannah
tells me that she's pregnant.

36:31.972 --> 36:33.669
You know, I think the,
uh, ship fumes are getting

36:33.713 --> 36:36.368
to your head there, Jace.Right.

36:38.370 --> 36:41.286
You know, that little boy, uh,

36:41.329 --> 36:43.288
he's gonna wake up
in that hospital

36:43.331 --> 36:45.246
and realize that
his daddy's gone.

36:45.290 --> 36:48.249
That man did
everything right.

36:48.293 --> 36:50.599
Gave every breath to that kid.

36:50.643 --> 36:52.558
And this is how
it all plays out.

36:54.342 --> 36:57.998
"Just a shooter."

36:58.041 --> 37:00.392
I wasn't able to protect him.

37:00.435 --> 37:02.437
Well...

37:02.481 --> 37:07.137
this job is always gonna remind
us that life isn't fair, man.

37:07.181 --> 37:08.617
Yeah.

37:08.661 --> 37:12.230
What isn't fair is what
I'm doing to my kid.

37:12.273 --> 37:13.709
She was conceived

37:13.753 --> 37:18.061
in a screwup while I was
serving time for a screwup.

37:18.105 --> 37:19.498
I mean, it's not like she's
just coming into this world

37:19.541 --> 37:21.239
on a hot streak.

37:23.197 --> 37:24.329
No, I just think...

37:26.244 --> 37:29.203
...like maybe she'd be
better off without me.

37:29.247 --> 37:32.162
[clears throat]
All right.

37:32.206 --> 37:34.643
Listen, Sonny.
[exhales]

37:38.081 --> 37:40.345
You're kidding me, right?What?

37:45.350 --> 37:47.613
[sniffs]
Yeah.

37:47.656 --> 37:50.442
You're drinking?
You're drinking.

37:50.485 --> 37:53.401
If you get caught, this
whole team could get bounced...

37:53.445 --> 37:55.273
Oh, there's the Jace--
There's the Jace I know....from deployment, right?

37:55.316 --> 37:58.014
Oh, yeah.Got to make better
choices, Sonny. Stupid.

37:58.058 --> 37:59.538
[liquid splashing]

38:03.237 --> 38:04.717
You know, I'm always gonna
be here for you.

38:04.760 --> 38:06.240
You know that, right?

38:06.284 --> 38:08.286
But you got to evolve.

38:09.591 --> 38:12.768
Better choices. Copy?

38:18.121 --> 38:19.601
Roger that.

38:20.602 --> 38:22.604
[device beeping]CLAY: Damn it.

38:25.259 --> 38:27.217
Spenser. You have a minute?

38:27.261 --> 38:29.263
You need my help
with something, sir?

38:31.221 --> 38:33.441
Relax.

38:33.485 --> 38:38.533
I'm just curious about your take
on what happened today.

38:38.577 --> 38:40.666
Op was sideways from the start.

38:40.709 --> 38:43.756
I'm guessing you helped
keep it on the rails?

38:43.799 --> 38:47.150
We all did our part.

38:47.194 --> 38:49.152
Well, it's becoming clear to me
that your part

38:49.196 --> 38:52.068
is a lot more than the Six
on your sleeve.

38:52.112 --> 38:54.288
Team's got some shaky pieces,
you're one who's solid.

38:54.332 --> 38:56.725
[laughs softly]

38:56.769 --> 38:59.293
Thought I was the one
you were warned about.

39:01.164 --> 39:02.688
I was warned your ambition
and drive to lead

39:02.731 --> 39:04.516
could be problematic.

39:04.559 --> 39:08.433
Problem I think this team
could really use right now.

39:11.436 --> 39:14.395
Look, I'm just here
to kick doors.

39:14.439 --> 39:16.745
You know, not really
looking for anything more.

39:16.789 --> 39:19.357
Might buy that if I didn't see
how you study

39:19.400 --> 39:20.532
Jason's every move.

39:20.575 --> 39:23.665
And looking or not,

39:23.709 --> 39:27.452
the job always finds those
who are capable of more,

39:27.495 --> 39:29.410
pulls it out of them.

39:29.454 --> 39:31.760
Try to make it work
on your terms,

39:31.804 --> 39:35.329
hold something back
for yourself?

39:35.373 --> 39:36.852
The job just gets greedier.

39:42.205 --> 39:45.208
Not sure what more
I can do, sir.

39:45.252 --> 39:48.211
Job will let you know.

39:48.255 --> 39:49.735
Got no doubt you'll rise to it.

39:57.395 --> 39:59.397
[exhales]

40:05.838 --> 40:07.840
[sighs]

40:16.849 --> 40:18.241
[helicopter blades whirring]

40:20.287 --> 40:22.768
Ship noises, they
keeping you up again?

40:22.811 --> 40:25.248
Uh-- What's your excuse?

40:25.292 --> 40:28.164
Eh, I opened one of those
boxes you warned me about.

40:28.208 --> 40:29.601
[chuckles]

40:29.644 --> 40:31.646
Thought you could help
someone work their problem?

40:31.690 --> 40:32.865
Let me guess,

40:32.908 --> 40:35.476
reached your hand in
and got bit, huh?

40:35.520 --> 40:36.695
Nothing I couldn't handle.

40:36.738 --> 40:39.611
Glad that worked out for you.

40:42.962 --> 40:44.659
What happened with that doctor?

40:44.703 --> 40:46.574
I mean,

40:46.618 --> 40:48.402
she had you rattled.

40:50.317 --> 40:51.927
Quit while you're ahead,
brother. It was nothing.

40:51.971 --> 40:53.929
No, it wasn't nothing.

40:53.973 --> 40:56.236
I mean, she nearly jumped
out of her shoes,

40:56.279 --> 40:57.759
you came at her so hard.

40:57.803 --> 41:01.415
She... I told her
Naima was a nurse.

41:01.459 --> 41:03.678
She pressed a little,
hit a nerve. That's all.

41:03.722 --> 41:07.595
Same nerve that, uh,
had you sleeping in the cages?

41:09.858 --> 41:12.861
All right, man,
look, the truth is,

41:12.905 --> 41:16.212
I left things a bit of a mess
back home with Naima.

41:16.256 --> 41:17.823
Yeah, with everything you've
both been through, all right?

41:17.866 --> 41:20.434
Captivity, being tortured.

41:21.740 --> 41:24.873
No, it-- We were off
since before all that.

41:24.917 --> 41:27.267
But we'll work
it out. It's...

41:28.573 --> 41:30.575
It's not on you
to fix this problem for me.

41:32.272 --> 41:33.534
I wouldn't think about
giving marriage advice

41:33.578 --> 41:35.231
to the team unicorn.

41:35.275 --> 41:37.538
[both laugh]

41:37.582 --> 41:39.584
Yeah.

41:40.585 --> 41:42.587
So, uh,

41:42.630 --> 41:44.676
that's what had you
on edge, huh?

41:47.983 --> 41:51.291
Actually, the truth is,
it's a...

41:51.334 --> 41:52.814
it's a load off just
sharing it with you.

41:54.686 --> 41:56.949
Gonna sleep easier tonight.
Tell you that much.

41:56.992 --> 41:58.994
Oh, glad I could help.

42:00.779 --> 42:02.345
Guess that makes me
two for two. Boom.

42:02.389 --> 42:04.260
[laughs] You're getting
cocky there, Dr. Phil.

42:04.304 --> 42:05.740
What are you,
you gonna trade in your rifle

42:05.784 --> 42:08.308
for a box of tissues?Another sideways
op like today,

42:08.351 --> 42:09.744
I might have to.

42:09.788 --> 42:12.878
[chuckles]
Yeah.
