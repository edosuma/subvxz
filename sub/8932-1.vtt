Hundreds!

Try to pull a
fast one on Cyril Sneer?!

But wait! Let me explain!

Quiet, peaceful, serene.

00:27.861 --> 00:30.263
That is, until
Bert Raccoon wakes up.

00:30.263 --> 00:32.098
Bert Raccoon: Yahoooo!

00:33.867 --> 00:35.635
Yeeeehaaaa!

Yikes!

00:38.071 --> 00:39.372
Yaaaah...

00:41.941 --> 00:43.476
Yeaaaah!

00:43.476 --> 00:46.579
Luckily, he has some
good friends to help him out.

00:53.887 --> 00:56.356
Life would be simple
in the forest except for...

00:57.991 --> 00:59.426
Cyril Sneer!

01:02.862 --> 01:05.031

01:23.983 --> 01:25.785

01:26.619 --> 01:28.621
But beneath the placid exterior,

01:28.621 --> 01:31.224
the inhabitants have
been quietly preparing

01:31.224 --> 01:34.227
to give Cyril Sneer
a shocking surprise

01:34.227 --> 01:35.495
he won't soon forget.

01:36.129 --> 01:40.433
Yes, the tranquility of the
forest will soon be shattered.

01:42.635 --> 01:44.137
Did you
see that one jump?

01:45.105 --> 01:46.739
They are
jumping, all right,

01:46.739 --> 01:48.975
but they're sure not biting.

01:48.975 --> 01:51.978
I'd be very surprised,
if we catch anything today.

01:52.879 --> 01:54.747
Maybe we should
give up on the fishing

01:54.747 --> 01:57.083
and go back to
working on the plan.

01:57.083 --> 02:00.086
Do you think it will
really teach Cyril a lesson?

02:00.086 --> 02:02.155
Once and for all!

02:02.155 --> 02:04.224
He'll never know what
hit him.

The Pig 2: I knew those crummy
raccoons were up to no good.

02:19.339 --> 02:21.441
The Pig 3: I could
sniff it in the air.

02:22.509 --> 02:24.611

better know about this.

Simple! The balloon

dumb as they look!

07:47.834 --> 07:50.269
Note the masks on their eyes.

07:50.269 --> 07:52.672
A sure sign of a thief,

a robber,

Cyril Sneer to take care of!

11:58.551 --> 12:00.519
Now, how do you know this?

12:00.519 --> 12:02.722
The Pig 1:
In the woods, we overheard

12:02.722 --> 12:04.857
two of Cedric's friends talking!

12:04.857 --> 12:06.559
Cedric's friends?!

12:07.359 --> 12:08.360
Cedric??

12:09.128 --> 12:10.863
Of course!

12:10.863 --> 12:13.199
He knows some of these vermin.

12:13.199 --> 12:15.701
I'll send him out as a spy.

12:15.701 --> 12:17.403
He'll find out where they're at,

12:17.403 --> 12:19.705
and then I'll move in
and put a stop to this.

12:24.176 --> 12:27.480
Dear Sophia,
Pop suspects.

12:27.480 --> 12:30.249
Conceal all the preparations.

12:30.249 --> 12:33.285
Everything is not
going as planned.

12:33.285 --> 12:36.756
Signed... Cedric Sneer.

12:39.258 --> 12:40.259
Cedric!

12:40.726 --> 12:42.328
I wanna talk to
you about this... wh...

12:42.328 --> 12:43.829
What's this?!

12:43.829 --> 12:45.931
M-m-my homework?

12:45.931 --> 12:49.135
You've been out
of school for three years!

12:49.135 --> 12:51.704
It's late?

12:52.104 --> 12:53.539
Ehm!

12:54.874 --> 12:56.408
As planned?!

12:56.408 --> 13:00.146
My only son has
planned all this?!

13:00.146 --> 13:01.413
My son?!

13:01.413 --> 13:04.250
My ex-son, Cedric Sneer?!

13:04.250 --> 13:07.620
Let me explain, Pop.

13:07.620 --> 13:09.421
There's nothing to explain!

13:09.421 --> 13:11.724
My own son plotting
to overthrow me.

13:12.658 --> 13:14.226
Very commendable son!

13:14.727 --> 13:16.796
I didn't know you had it in you!

13:16.796 --> 13:20.399
But no matter, Cedric,
my boy, it didn't
work!

13:20.399 --> 13:21.400
Guards!

13:21.400 --> 13:23.636
You got it all wrong!

13:24.170 --> 13:25.504
Take him to the dungeon!

13:25.504 --> 13:28.007
Not the dungeon, Pop!

13:28.007 --> 13:30.109
Not again!

13:30.109 --> 13:32.311
And no color TV.

13:32.311 --> 13:33.846
Aw, pop!

13:37.716 --> 13:40.586
Now that Cyril
had uncovered Cedric's plan,

13:40.586 --> 13:42.688
it seemed doomed to failure.

13:42.688 --> 13:45.591
The only hope now
lay in getting the note

13:45.591 --> 13:48.427
to Schaeffer and the Raccoons...
in time.
