01:32.927 --> 01:35.221
That's it.

01:37.307 --> 01:39.559
Good girl.

01:40.810 --> 01:42.604
Good boy.

01:47.484 --> 01:50.779
My dear Lukka.
Eat some more.

04:11.628 --> 04:13.421
Yes.
Come along.

06:11.539 --> 06:13.124
Hello, there.

06:16.711 --> 06:18.608
That's it.

06:18.643 --> 06:20.471
There you go.

06:20.506 --> 06:22.675
You'll do just fine.

06:45.114 --> 06:46.741
Leg.

06:48.117 --> 06:49.952
18.

06:54.457 --> 06:56.084
Rump.

06:57.126 --> 06:58.795
Eight.

07:00.421 --> 07:01.964
Back.

07:01.999 --> 07:03.473
Nine.

07:03.508 --> 07:08.262
In this nation,
none has played a larger role

07:08.297 --> 07:11.933
in our survival
through ice and fire.

07:13.559 --> 07:18.064
Resistant and tough,
whatever happens,

07:19.107 --> 07:23.361
mankind's saviour and
friend for a thousand years,

07:26.155 --> 07:31.119
all year round,
in joy and disharmony,

07:32.120 --> 07:38.091
sheep are woven into our
farmers' work and being.

07:38.560 --> 07:44.377
Bright was the outlook
when our sheep felt fine.

07:44.841 --> 07:49.929
Black were the nights when
the flock was in decline.

07:55.476 --> 08:00.648
Now it's time to award the
prizes for the three best,

08:00.683 --> 08:03.985
and Katrin the vet
is going to do that.

08:07.780 --> 08:13.578
Third prize goes to Finnur
Gudjonsson and his ram Heysi.

08:19.000 --> 08:22.962
Heysi comes from Kveikur
and Goa from Svínafell.

08:22.997 --> 08:25.763
He got 84 points.

08:25.798 --> 08:31.012
Second place goes to
Gudmundur Bodvarsson

08:31.047 --> 08:33.054
with his ram Garpur.

08:37.768 --> 08:43.566
Garpur is item the famous Bolstadur breed,
from Godi and Birta.

08:43.601 --> 08:45.776
He got 86 points.

08:46.652 --> 08:52.241
I must point out that it
was a very close call

08:52.276 --> 08:54.417
between the two top rams.

08:54.452 --> 08:59.582
The result was determined by
the thickness of the back muscle.

09:01.042 --> 09:04.462
The rams are both from
the same renowned stock,

09:04.497 --> 09:08.181
and this year's winner is...

09:08.216 --> 09:11.385
Kristinn Bodvarsson
and his ram Sproti.

09:21.854 --> 09:24.899
Sproti comes from Loki
and Sturla from Bolstad.

09:24.934 --> 09:28.277
He got 86.5 points.

09:32.662 --> 09:38.162
- Congratulations, my dear Kiddi.
- Yes. Thank you so much.

09:38.197 --> 09:41.457
- Congratulations!
- Congratulations, dear Gummi.

09:41.492 --> 09:43.251
Well done.

09:44.835 --> 09:47.838
- A toast to the Bolstadar brothers!
- Yes.

09:47.873 --> 09:49.757
No, thank you.

09:52.260 --> 09:56.013
It was really close.
Just a difference in one bit of muscle.

09:57.723 --> 10:00.476
- You'll take it next year, Gummi.
- Yes, you will.

10:03.771 --> 10:06.274
Good luck with everything.

10:29.297 --> 10:32.133
Come here.

10:34.302 --> 10:38.306
Let me see your back muscle.

10:38.341 --> 10:41.309
What?
Something wrong?

11:08.085 --> 11:10.546
Good boy.
Come along.

11:25.936 --> 11:28.939
Easy, now.
Calm down.

11:32.818 --> 11:35.821
Calm down, Garpur.

12:28.416 --> 12:32.670
You did well, my dear Sproti.

13:20.676 --> 13:25.639
That's it. That's my boy.
Let me see you.

14:13.687 --> 14:16.739
- Hello.
- Hello, Gudmundur.

14:16.774 --> 14:19.318
- Hello, Gummi.
- Hello, dear Hildur.

14:19.353 --> 14:21.862
- How are you?
- All good.

14:25.574 --> 14:28.994
- Can I have a word with you?
- Yes, yes.

14:31.205 --> 14:33.457
I'm going to have
a word with Gummi.

14:42.174 --> 14:44.218
Is something wrong?

14:49.265 --> 14:53.686
I'm afraid something is
wrong with Kiddi's sheep.

14:55.062 --> 14:58.190
Oh?
What could it be?

14:59.984 --> 15:03.320
I'm afraid it might
be scrapie.

15:04.822 --> 15:08.742
Scrapie?
It could hardly be...

15:09.869 --> 15:14.498
- That ram of his,
the one that won. - Yes.

15:15.583 --> 15:18.022
I examined him yesterday.

15:18.057 --> 15:20.462
He has all the symptoms.

15:22.214 --> 15:27.094
My dear Gummi, don't you think
Katrin would have noticed

15:27.129 --> 15:29.680
if the prize ram had scrapie?

15:37.229 --> 15:39.815
Do you want me
to talk to Kiddi?

15:42.151 --> 15:46.906
- Get someone to examine the ram?
- Would you do that?

15:47.865 --> 15:51.660
You haven't spoken to
each other in 40 years.

15:51.695 --> 15:53.621
Why begin now?

15:56.415 --> 16:01.024
If it turns out to be scrapie,
wouldn't it be likely

16:01.059 --> 16:05.633
that both of our herds would
have to be slaughtered?

16:05.668 --> 16:08.594
I don't believe it's scrapie.

16:09.929 --> 16:12.765
We've never had
any cases of scrapie.

16:12.800 --> 16:15.601
How could it have
been brought here?

16:18.312 --> 16:22.775
Aren't you just still recovering
from the ram competition?

18:26.398 --> 18:28.358
Take that, you bastard!

18:31.820 --> 18:36.116
You won't get away with this!
Fucking ram murderer!

18:37.326 --> 18:39.870
He doesn't have
fucking scrapie.

18:41.080 --> 18:43.290
You're just making it up.

18:44.124 --> 18:46.960
You're just a sore loser!

18:47.836 --> 18:49.338
Gummi?

18:50.047 --> 18:52.049
Gummi, can you hear me?

19:32.631 --> 19:34.383
What happened?

19:40.097 --> 19:43.976
There was a shooting
practice yesterday.

19:46.228 --> 19:50.607
I heard that Kiddi's ram
was taken for examination?

19:52.860 --> 19:56.238
Do you think he
could have scrapie?

19:57.197 --> 20:00.701
You'll have to
ask him about that.

20:01.869 --> 20:03.912
I just spoke to him.

20:05.414 --> 20:07.249
He said it's all
coming from you.

20:07.284 --> 20:10.460
Yes?
He said that, did he?

20:20.179 --> 20:24.850
I'm no expert
on scrapie, Grímur.

20:25.684 --> 20:27.693
But when I examined
the ram yesterday,

20:27.728 --> 20:30.063
that was the first thing
that came to mind.

20:30.098 --> 20:31.732
Damn it.

20:34.902 --> 20:38.530
If we have scrapie in the valley,
we're in deep shit.

20:38.565 --> 20:42.159
You lot over on the east side
have no need to worry

20:42.194 --> 20:45.054
if scrapie shows up here.

20:45.089 --> 20:47.880
We borrowed him this winter.

20:47.915 --> 20:51.418
The creature sired
half our lambs.

20:53.003 --> 20:56.798
<i>Invoice
Two windows</i>

21:22.658 --> 21:24.534
To Kiddi.

21:37.464 --> 21:39.466
What's up, my friend?

21:40.133 --> 21:42.678
What do you have there?

22:55.751 --> 22:57.836
Hi, Gudmundur.

22:57.871 --> 22:59.921
I have bad news.

23:01.465 --> 23:04.885
Your brother's sheep
are infected with scrapie.

23:06.428 --> 23:09.222
We are investigating
the nearest farms.

23:10.265 --> 23:12.809
May we look in
your sheep shed?

23:14.936 --> 23:16.396
Yes.

23:35.207 --> 23:38.335
<i>A case of scrapie has been found
on the Bolstad farm in Bardardalur.</i>

23:38.370 --> 23:41.171
<i>This is the first occurrence
of the disease in this valley.</i>

23:41.206 --> 23:43.440
<i>According to Katrin Nielsen,
the district vet,</i>

23:43.475 --> 23:45.640
<i>the scrapie was diagnosed
in an adult ram,</i>

23:45.675 --> 23:47.656
<i>and tests are being
carried out to determine</i>

23:47.691 --> 23:49.603
<i>whether it's present
on neighbouring farms.</i>

23:49.638 --> 23:52.578
<i>No decision has been
made concerning a slaughter.</i>

23:52.613 --> 23:55.484
<i>It is believed that
scrapie came to Iceland</i>

23:55.519 --> 23:58.021
<i>with British sheep at
the end of the 19th century,</i>

23:58.056 --> 24:00.489
<i>and has not yet been
entirely eliminated here.</i>

24:00.524 --> 24:03.902
<i>It is an infectious disease that attacks
the brains and spinal cords of sheep,</i>

24:03.937 --> 24:05.946
<i>and is incurable.</i>

25:13.346 --> 25:15.605
Dear friends.

25:15.640 --> 25:18.935
Results of the
tests just arrived.

25:20.479 --> 25:25.942
Scrapie was found
on two other farms,

25:27.068 --> 25:31.698
at Haugi and Seljatunga.

25:38.497 --> 25:41.583
It has therefore
been decided

25:42.375 --> 25:45.879
that all the sheep in the
valley must be slaughtered.

25:49.591 --> 25:52.017
Is this the final decision?

25:52.052 --> 25:56.181
They say that there's been
enough contact between them,

25:56.216 --> 25:59.476
and in order to
eliminate the disease,

26:00.227 --> 26:02.521
they've got to take
the entire valley.

26:02.556 --> 26:05.023
Why not just take us, too?

26:05.058 --> 26:07.067
Finish the job!

26:10.403 --> 26:12.822
We need to trust the vets.

26:12.857 --> 26:15.207
They don't know anything.

26:15.242 --> 26:18.627
University educated
fools from down south.

26:18.662 --> 26:22.478
- What would you do, Kiddi?
- I want us to put a stop to this nonsense!

26:22.513 --> 26:26.294
- How are we supposed to do that?
- We just refuse to slaughter our sheep.

26:28.672 --> 26:32.571
How do you think it will be
to live here with no sheep?

26:32.606 --> 26:36.471
- Have you thought about that?
- It's just for two years.

26:36.506 --> 26:39.231
And then what?

26:39.266 --> 26:43.818
Import some hormone-sheep
from the Westfjords?

26:43.853 --> 26:48.149
I agree with Kiddi. We can't just say
yes and amen to these veterinarians.

26:48.184 --> 26:49.574
They're not holy.

26:49.609 --> 26:53.078
I trust Katrin to make the
right decision in this matter.

26:53.113 --> 26:56.825
As I see it, it's a question of whether
we want to cut down now,

26:56.860 --> 27:00.554
or to have the scrapie hanging
over us in the coming years.

27:00.589 --> 27:04.249
Just do what you want, Finnur.
I'll have nothing to do with it.

27:08.628 --> 27:13.300
It's very important now
that we stand together.

27:14.968 --> 27:18.270
This is a great
shock to all of us,

27:18.305 --> 27:21.641
and it's understandable
that people are wounded.

27:22.809 --> 27:25.604
But the decision
has been taken,

27:26.521 --> 27:29.274
and it will not be changed.

27:41.786 --> 27:47.292
<i>LINE OF DEFENCE
Sheep diseases - contagious!</i>

28:48.895 --> 28:50.647
Yes, Gudmundur.

28:52.232 --> 28:54.567
Yes.
Yes, hello, Katrin.

28:57.404 --> 28:59.656
Yes.

29:00.615 --> 29:02.409
Yes.

29:04.703 --> 29:06.746
Yes, that's true.

29:07.747 --> 29:10.250
Yes, that's life.

29:17.924 --> 29:21.052
Yes...
No, I want to bury them here.

29:22.178 --> 29:26.182
They were raised here,
and I want them to rest here.

29:27.434 --> 29:30.395
Yes. No.
I'm certain about that.

29:37.736 --> 29:40.947
Yes.
Yes, goodbye.

30:26.868 --> 30:28.912
My dear girl.

33:07.904 --> 33:10.677
Let me go, you bastards!

33:10.712 --> 33:13.451
Leave my sheep alone!

33:50.989 --> 33:53.032
Why did you do this, Gummi?

33:58.037 --> 34:00.123
I wanted to kill
my sheep myself.

34:07.714 --> 34:09.757
- Is this all of them?
- Yes.

34:12.010 --> 34:14.469
147 sheep.

34:17.764 --> 34:20.935
Very well.
Clean this up.

34:24.313 --> 34:27.692
You've got to follow
the rules, Gummi.

34:28.775 --> 34:31.737
You shouldn't have
slaughtered them yourself.

34:32.739 --> 34:37.243
If we're to eradicate this disease,
you've got to follow the rules.

35:27.502 --> 35:30.303
We pay for every sheep
that's slaughtered,

35:30.338 --> 35:33.820
and you're also paid so-called
"product loss compensation",

35:33.855 --> 35:37.303
according to average production
for the past three years.

35:37.338 --> 35:39.847
Payments are distributed
over a two-year period,

35:39.882 --> 35:43.434
then you can apply
to acquire new sheep.

35:44.852 --> 35:48.481
The vets will assist you in
cleaning out your buildings.

35:49.816 --> 35:51.783
Any questions?

35:51.818 --> 35:54.285
No.
I don't think so.

35:54.320 --> 35:56.864
Have you thought
about the future?

35:58.616 --> 36:00.368
Will you keep on farming?

36:03.913 --> 36:05.588
Where do I sign?

36:05.623 --> 36:08.251
There, at the bottom.

36:12.463 --> 36:15.049
- Yes.
- Thank you.

36:19.303 --> 36:21.097
Listen...

36:22.223 --> 36:25.643
Do you think you can help me
get in touch with Kristinn?

36:27.061 --> 36:28.736
He lives next door.

36:28.771 --> 36:34.569
Yes, I know.
But he hasn't wanted to talk to us.

36:35.486 --> 36:37.655
Could you talk to him?

36:41.909 --> 36:44.287
You're brothers, right?

36:46.581 --> 36:48.875
Kiddi and I don't
speak to each other.

36:53.379 --> 36:55.888
You need to clean everything.

36:55.923 --> 37:00.636
The shit, the hay,
everything on the floor.

37:00.671 --> 37:03.472
- Also the wood.
- And the pens?

37:03.507 --> 37:05.516
Yes, those also.
All wood.

37:08.895 --> 37:13.608
This pitchfork here.
Everything that you've used in here.

37:13.643 --> 37:15.491
Tools, clothing, everything.

37:15.526 --> 37:19.655
You need to destroy all of it.
It's best to burn it.

37:22.200 --> 37:25.703
You also need to clean out the
barn and destroy all the hay.

37:25.738 --> 37:27.545
And absolutely don't sell it.

37:27.580 --> 37:30.708
Scrapie can be
transmitted by hay mites.

37:31.542 --> 37:35.379
- Do I need to destroy all the hay?
- Yes.

39:18.607 --> 39:20.651
Well, Gummi?

39:22.069 --> 39:24.363
What do you say now?

39:26.449 --> 39:28.451
Do you know what
you've done?

39:29.577 --> 39:32.913
You've wiped out
the Bolstadar stock.

39:34.874 --> 39:37.793
This is going to be
a hell of a winter!

39:38.836 --> 39:41.839
No sheep.
Just the two of us.

39:42.882 --> 39:45.759
That's what you wanted!

39:45.794 --> 39:48.637
Isn't that what you wanted?

42:22.374 --> 42:24.751
That's my girls.

42:24.786 --> 42:27.129
Here you go.

42:40.809 --> 42:45.773
Here you go, Garpur.
That's my man.

42:48.859 --> 42:51.111
Good boy.

42:51.146 --> 42:53.364
Have some.

43:20.307 --> 43:22.268
Damn it.

43:27.481 --> 43:30.234
Go away.
Go!

44:30.961 --> 44:32.755
- Hi, there.
- Hi.

44:36.800 --> 44:40.679
- Where did you get it?
- It's from Bogi, in the next valley.

44:40.714 --> 44:42.848
He has more if you need it.

44:48.228 --> 44:50.189
Got some coffee?

44:52.358 --> 44:55.653
No, I don't have any coffee.

44:57.696 --> 44:59.698
Nothing stronger?

45:00.699 --> 45:05.037
No, I'm sorry, Grímur.
I have nothing to offer.

45:13.253 --> 45:16.090
- Did you clean already?
- Yes.

45:20.260 --> 45:22.304
It's fucking boring.

45:28.060 --> 45:30.854
- Has Kiddi started?
- No.

46:11.186 --> 46:13.230
Well, Garpur.

46:18.652 --> 46:20.779
It's your big moment.

46:32.916 --> 46:36.170
Yes.
Well done.

46:37.129 --> 46:39.381
That's the spirit.

46:43.469 --> 46:46.013
Yes, go on, handsome.

46:48.807 --> 46:49.975
Yeah.

46:53.479 --> 46:56.982
Yeah, yeah!
You can do it!

46:59.568 --> 47:01.361
Help!

47:02.446 --> 47:04.281
Help!

47:05.574 --> 47:08.160
You have to help me.
I think he's dying.

47:12.372 --> 47:14.124
Help me!

47:39.691 --> 47:41.318
Pull there.

47:42.236 --> 47:43.946
That's it.

47:45.823 --> 47:47.866
- Got it?
- I got it.

47:49.326 --> 47:51.578
- The sweater as well?
- Yes.

47:56.124 --> 47:57.835
That's it.

48:19.606 --> 48:22.109
I came close to driving
right past him.

48:23.610 --> 48:26.613
He was lying in a
ditch just down there.

48:28.866 --> 48:31.535
- Is this man from here?
- Yes.

48:33.036 --> 48:36.414
Has this happened before?

48:36.449 --> 48:39.793
Yes, but it's been a while.

48:43.171 --> 48:46.758
He probably would have frozen
to death if I hadn't found him.

48:47.634 --> 48:49.136
Thanks.

48:56.184 --> 48:59.605
- Do you live together?
- No, he lives next door.

49:03.692 --> 49:05.701
We are brothers.

49:05.736 --> 49:08.954
OK. Have you been
living here long?

49:08.989 --> 49:13.118
I was born and raised here,
grew up where Kiddi lives now.

49:13.153 --> 49:14.745
- His name is Kiddi?
- Yes.

49:15.746 --> 49:17.789
And what, no women?

49:21.960 --> 49:25.380
No.
There aren't many around.

49:26.089 --> 49:29.509
- You haven't had housekeepers?
- No. Not me, at least.

49:29.544 --> 49:33.555
Kiddi had some.
They all ran away from him.

49:42.022 --> 49:45.817
I'm working for the Veterinary Authority.
Disinfecting sheep sheds.

49:49.988 --> 49:52.866
- Weren't your sheep slaughtered?
- Yes.

49:56.662 --> 49:58.997
Must have been hard.

50:07.839 --> 50:09.508
Yes.

50:19.977 --> 50:21.645
What was that?

50:23.438 --> 50:26.191
That... just my cats
playing around.

50:27.526 --> 50:31.697
- OK. Do you have many cats?
- Yes, lots. Merry Christmas, my friend.

50:31.732 --> 50:33.664
Merry Christmas.

50:33.699 --> 50:37.452
- My greetings to your brother.
- I'll pass that on.

50:37.487 --> 50:39.496
Yes.
Well, goodbye.

54:00.864 --> 54:05.118
What do you say?
Have you finished cleaning?

54:07.329 --> 54:09.748
- Yes.
- Yes.

54:12.626 --> 54:14.127
How about you?

54:18.715 --> 54:23.762
No.
We decided to quit.

54:29.267 --> 54:32.062
We're going bankrupt anyway.

54:33.271 --> 54:36.942
So we're just going to take
the opportunity and leave.

54:38.526 --> 54:41.821
- Where will you go?
- We haven't decided.

54:44.616 --> 54:47.077
We can't see living
here two more years

54:47.112 --> 54:49.871
with no sheep and
a pile of loans.

54:52.457 --> 54:56.002
Nor is it certain the
scrapie is going anywhere.

54:56.037 --> 54:57.886
It doesn't need to
come up again, Villi.

54:57.921 --> 55:00.632
Have you talked to the farmers
in Svarfaðardalur?

55:00.667 --> 55:03.343
They've had to slaughter
their sheep three times!

55:04.552 --> 55:06.972
We're still thinking
things over.

55:07.806 --> 55:10.106
The kids have moved out,

55:10.141 --> 55:14.396
and when the sheep are gone,
there won't be much left for us here.

55:14.431 --> 55:17.023
Just to tell it like it is.

56:38.063 --> 56:41.483
It takes an effort to come
here at this time of the year.

56:42.734 --> 56:45.028
Yes, you could say that.

56:51.743 --> 56:53.328
Yes.

56:56.122 --> 56:58.375
It's this matter
with your brother.

56:59.751 --> 57:03.463
As you know,
he hasn't been very cooperative.

57:04.798 --> 57:08.093
It's starting to cause us
considerable concern.

57:09.219 --> 57:12.889
He's the only one
who hasn't cleaned.

57:14.891 --> 57:17.518
Unfortunately,
we can't bring in new sheep

57:17.553 --> 57:20.146
until all sheep sheds
have been disinfected.

57:23.149 --> 57:25.110
There is more to it.

57:26.111 --> 57:28.071
I checked the papers.

57:29.114 --> 57:31.491
Kristinn doesn't own his land?

57:33.118 --> 57:35.161
It's all in your name.

57:36.788 --> 57:40.458
- Yes.
- What's the reason?

57:52.137 --> 57:54.764
My father didn't want
Kiddi to take over.

57:57.183 --> 57:59.519
I promised my mother
before she died

58:00.979 --> 58:03.815
that Kiddi would get
to stay at the old farm.

58:08.903 --> 58:11.746
You know what that means?

58:11.781 --> 58:14.159
You're responsible
for your brother.

58:16.995 --> 58:19.170
He lives on your land,

58:19.205 --> 58:22.417
and if he doesn't follow the rules,
it's you that...

58:24.335 --> 58:26.129
That what?

58:29.007 --> 58:33.219
If it comes to a legal fight,
you'll be the one that's sued.

58:37.849 --> 58:41.269
It would be best if you
two could settle things.

59:10.298 --> 59:12.258
To Kiddi.

59:26.773 --> 59:28.900
So, so, so.

59:33.238 --> 59:35.031
Gummi!

59:37.242 --> 59:39.911
Gummi, are you there,
you bastard?

59:41.746 --> 59:44.228
Gummi, what's this

59:44.618 --> 59:48.426
bullshit you've been writing?

59:50.505 --> 59:54.050
Who the fuck do
you think you are?

59:55.760 --> 01:00:01.683
Do you think you're my boss?

01:00:02.892 --> 01:00:07.230
It's not up to you to
tell me what to do!

01:00:08.856 --> 01:00:14.612
- I'll just do what suits me best.
- Shut the fuck up, you fucking wanker.

01:03:29.307 --> 01:03:35.021
Are you hungry, my friend?

01:03:44.822 --> 01:03:47.241
Here you go.

01:05:23.045 --> 01:05:25.089
Thank you, and take care.

01:05:47.945 --> 01:05:49.906
Damn it!

01:06:29.028 --> 01:06:30.947
Here we go.

01:07:37.221 --> 01:07:39.473
I know what you
have in the basement.

01:09:38.425 --> 01:09:40.926
Somi.
Somi, my friend.

01:09:40.962 --> 01:09:43.430
What have you got there?

01:10:22.553 --> 01:10:24.680
Thanks for the loan.

01:10:26.891 --> 01:10:28.642
Gummi.

01:10:33.898 --> 01:10:36.108
How many are there?

01:10:37.610 --> 01:10:39.910
Is there a ram?

01:10:39.945 --> 01:10:41.739
What does it matter to you?

01:10:42.573 --> 01:10:46.702
Well, these are the only sheep
left of the Bolstadur stock.

01:10:46.737 --> 01:10:49.837
- It matters to me.
- Fucking bullshit.

01:10:49.872 --> 01:10:53.584
Those are my sheep.
Don't you dare come near them!

01:12:05.322 --> 01:12:07.324
Yes, yes.
Fantastic!

01:12:07.359 --> 01:12:09.510
Let me see.

01:12:09.545 --> 01:12:11.627
Yes, yes, yes.

01:12:11.662 --> 01:12:15.791
We'll get two lambs here.
Yes, yes.

01:12:17.751 --> 01:12:20.421
Let me see.
Yes, yes.

01:12:22.214 --> 01:12:24.216
This is good.

01:12:28.262 --> 01:12:30.827
Well, my dear Garpur.

01:12:30.862 --> 01:12:33.392
It's over for now.

01:12:33.427 --> 01:12:35.859
Fantastic!

01:12:35.894 --> 01:12:38.230
100 per cent successful
performance.

01:13:03.339 --> 01:13:05.382
Can I use your bathroom?

01:13:06.592 --> 01:13:08.719
Yes, yes, go ahead.

01:13:39.958 --> 01:13:41.919
Shit!

01:13:59.311 --> 01:14:01.063
Thanks.

01:14:37.266 --> 01:14:40.310
Let's go.
On your feet!

01:15:18.557 --> 01:15:21.351
Kiddi.
You have to help me.

01:15:21.386 --> 01:15:23.437
They're coming.

01:15:31.236 --> 01:15:33.238
Let's take them inside.

01:15:39.495 --> 01:15:41.288
Get in!

01:16:58.323 --> 01:17:01.660
- There are no sheep here.
- They were here just before.

01:17:01.695 --> 01:17:03.954
I don't believe this, Gummi!

01:17:03.989 --> 01:17:05.998
What are you thinking?

01:17:07.833 --> 01:17:09.793
Where are the sheep?

01:17:13.589 --> 01:17:15.931
Gummi.

01:17:15.966 --> 01:17:18.260
Where are the sheep?

01:17:24.308 --> 01:17:28.318
Unbelievable!
We have to look.

01:17:28.353 --> 01:17:31.815
- We have to look for them.
- They were here before.

01:17:50.792 --> 01:17:52.836
Maybe they're up
on the mountain?

01:17:53.879 --> 01:17:55.922
Shouldn't we call for help?

01:17:57.633 --> 01:17:59.676
Yes.
I guess.

01:18:01.470 --> 01:18:04.021
Station, Beggi here.

01:18:04.056 --> 01:18:07.726
We can't find them.
Let's get some assistance.

01:18:37.839 --> 01:18:41.134
Beggi here.
I found the sheep.

01:18:41.968 --> 01:18:43.929
Just right outside.

01:18:55.232 --> 01:18:57.317
Help me.

01:19:05.826 --> 01:19:09.705
- What should we do with the sheep?
- We take them to the mountains.

01:19:09.740 --> 01:19:12.290
- Mountains?
- Yes. Hvannalindir.

01:19:13.417 --> 01:19:19.089
- It's way up on the highland!
- If we manage, they'll survive the winter.

01:19:21.425 --> 01:19:23.635
Come on.
Let's hurry.

01:21:13.537 --> 01:21:15.497
This doesn't look good.

01:21:25.841 --> 01:21:27.801
We have to carry on.

01:22:10.552 --> 01:22:12.554
Damn it!

01:22:38.830 --> 01:22:40.874
Where are the sheep?

01:23:04.397 --> 01:23:06.024
Gummi!

01:23:07.901 --> 01:23:09.861
Gummi!

01:23:22.040 --> 01:23:24.125
Garpur!

01:24:52.672 --> 01:24:54.257
Gummi!

01:25:14.110 --> 01:25:16.279
Gummi, can you hear me?

01:28:17.168 --> 01:28:19.879
It's going to be just fine,
my dear Gummi.
