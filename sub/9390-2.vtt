01:01.293 --> 01:02.827
Hey, Quagmire,
what do you got there?

01:02.829 --> 01:04.896
It's the new Sports
Illustrated swimsuit issue.

01:04.898 --> 01:05.397
Check it out.

01:05.399 --> 01:07.632
Those swimsuit issues don't
excite me like they used to.

01:07.634 --> 01:10.035
I've been spoiled
by Internet porn.

01:10.037 --> 01:11.136
It's true.
Totally.

01:11.138 --> 01:12.737
What do you mean,
Internet porn?

01:12.739 --> 01:14.973
You, uh, don't know
about Internet porn?

01:14.975 --> 01:17.175
Don't know what? I'm not
really a computer guy.

01:17.177 --> 01:19.878
Quagmire, I would think
you, of all people,

01:19.880 --> 01:21.312
would know about Internet porn.

01:21.314 --> 01:23.548
They've got, like, thousands,
literally millions

01:23.550 --> 01:26.751
of naked pictures
on the Internet.

01:26.753 --> 01:27.352
What?

01:27.354 --> 01:29.154
And videos-- thousands of them.

01:29.156 --> 01:30.221
You guys are
messing with me.

01:30.223 --> 01:31.489
Quagmire, you don't use
the Internet?

01:31.491 --> 01:33.091
You mean that crappy
dial-up thing

01:33.093 --> 01:35.427
that's a pain in the ass? No,
I don't use the damn Internet.

01:35.429 --> 01:37.962
I thought that was for nerds.
Why didn't you guys tell me?!

01:37.964 --> 01:39.064
Oh, yeah.
You can even see

01:39.066 --> 01:41.099
Tanya Harding's
honeymoon video on there.

01:41.101 --> 01:45.136
I mean, it's gross,
but it's, like, famous gross.

01:45.138 --> 01:46.304
You know, these women
don't compare

01:46.306 --> 01:49.307
to the old swimsuit issues
with Kathy Ireland.

01:49.309 --> 01:50.575
Yeah. She had it going on.

01:50.577 --> 01:52.410
You know, Horace still
has one of those

01:52.412 --> 01:54.112
old beer promotion
cutouts of her

01:54.114 --> 01:55.847
from, like 1994
in the back room.

01:55.849 --> 01:57.082
Don't you, Horace?

01:57.084 --> 01:58.283
Oh, you mean this thing?

01:58.285 --> 01:59.551
I was about to throw it out.

01:59.553 --> 02:02.053
If anyone wants it, it's theirs.

Hey, Dad. Where are you going
with that cutout?

02:47.534 --> 02:50.034
Oh, hey, kids.
This is Kathy.

02:50.036 --> 02:51.603
We're designing lifestyle
products together.

02:51.605 --> 02:54.973
It's completely legitimate,
but don't tell your mother.

02:58.744 --> 03:01.279
I had a great time
today at the museum.

03:01.281 --> 03:02.981
You were the most
beautiful woman there.

03:02.983 --> 03:08.353
You know, Lois won't be home
from groceries for a while.

03:08.355 --> 03:10.255
I have an idea.

03:14.827 --> 03:15.794
Knock-knock.

03:15.796 --> 03:17.929
Anyone in the bathroom?

03:17.931 --> 03:19.397
(shower running)

03:21.333 --> 03:23.168
(screaming)

03:24.904 --> 03:28.173
I love the time we've spent
together, you know that?

03:28.175 --> 03:30.175
Hey, Kathy, guess what?

03:30.177 --> 03:31.876
I'm out.

03:31.878 --> 03:33.878
Under the table right now.

03:33.880 --> 03:35.079
I'm out.

03:35.081 --> 03:36.381
Peter?

03:36.383 --> 03:37.248
Oh, no.

03:37.250 --> 03:38.850
What the hell
is going on?

03:38.852 --> 03:40.952
I sent you to pick up
dinner an hour ago.

03:40.954 --> 03:43.188
What are you doing
with that cutout?

03:43.190 --> 03:45.156
You know what, Lois?
I'm glad you found out.

03:45.158 --> 03:47.592
I can't carry on
the charade anymore.

03:47.594 --> 03:49.093
I have an announcement to make.

03:49.095 --> 03:50.395
No, no, I'll do it.
I'll do it.

03:50.397 --> 03:52.297
I know I've been able
to keep this a secret,

03:52.299 --> 03:57.569
but Kathy and I are not actually
working on a project together.

03:57.571 --> 03:59.037
We're...

03:59.039 --> 04:00.071
in love.

04:00.073 --> 04:01.206
You're an idiot.

04:01.208 --> 04:02.240
My lawyer will call your lawyer.

04:02.242 --> 04:04.409
Ugh, this is
the stupidest thing he's done

04:04.411 --> 04:07.345
since he got in a turf war
with that cat.

04:07.347 --> 04:09.581
(both yowling)

04:15.020 --> 04:16.354
MAN:
Hey, shut up!

04:16.356 --> 04:18.356
(both yelp)

04:19.992 --> 04:23.127
Now, kids, you don't have to
call her "Mom" right away,

04:23.129 --> 04:24.996
but I do want you
guys to get along.

04:24.998 --> 04:26.631
Just give her a chance.
I think you'll like her.

04:26.633 --> 04:30.034
Maybe she'll let us do things
that Lois won't let us do!

04:30.036 --> 04:33.805
Yeah! Hey, Mom,
can I pull my pants down?

04:33.807 --> 04:35.773
If she doesn't answer,
does that mean "yes"?

04:35.775 --> 04:37.575
That's what I've
been going with.

04:37.577 --> 04:38.977
Yay!

04:38.979 --> 04:40.178
(laughing)

04:40.180 --> 04:42.480
I want to get in on that!
(both laughing)

04:42.482 --> 04:45.049
CHRIS:
Yeah. All right, all right...

04:45.051 --> 04:47.318
STEWIE:
Mine's better. Mine's better...

04:50.122 --> 04:52.156
Oh. Hello, Lois.
I would have thought

04:52.158 --> 04:53.725
you'd have moved in
with your mother by now.

04:53.727 --> 04:56.427
No, Peter. I'm just pretty much
letting this run its course.

04:56.429 --> 04:58.696
Well, I'm sorry you're
handling this so poorly,

04:58.698 --> 04:59.564
but have you seen Kathy?

04:59.566 --> 05:01.399
We were gonna go get
her passport renewed.

05:01.401 --> 05:04.402
Oh, Chris took her into his
room about ten minutes ago.

05:04.404 --> 05:05.770
What?! That whore!

05:05.772 --> 05:10.608
She's betrayed me worse than
Lady Macbeth betrayed Duncan.

05:12.044 --> 05:14.279
(roaring)

05:16.448 --> 05:17.248
I, uh...

05:17.250 --> 05:19.851
I don't know Shakespeare
very well.

05:19.853 --> 05:22.153
PETER:
Kathy?!

05:22.155 --> 05:23.221
Kathy!

05:23.223 --> 05:24.322
There you are!

05:24.324 --> 05:25.456
Oh, don't give me that look!

05:25.458 --> 05:27.292
You don't think I know
where you've been?

05:27.294 --> 05:29.494
How dare you make
a fool of me!

05:29.496 --> 05:31.162
Did you have sex
with that fat kid?

05:31.164 --> 05:33.031
Did you?!
Answer me!

05:33.033 --> 05:34.565
(gasps)
Oh, my God!

05:34.567 --> 05:37.001
Look what you made me do!

05:38.404 --> 05:41.639
(sobbing):
Why did you have to provoke me?!

05:41.641 --> 05:43.374
Why did you ha--?

05:43.376 --> 05:44.609
Quagmire?
There you are.

05:44.611 --> 05:46.311
Nobody's seen you in days.

05:46.313 --> 05:47.245
Hey, Peter.

05:47.247 --> 05:51.582
I just been, uh, checking out
some of that Internet porn.

05:51.584 --> 05:54.519
You okay?
Yeah, yeah.
I'm good, I'm good, I'm good.

05:54.521 --> 05:58.389
I'm just gonna go-go
and check my mail over there.

05:58.391 --> 06:00.525
You been lifting weights?
Uh, no.

06:00.527 --> 06:04.762
No. No, I don't think I... No.

06:04.764 --> 06:07.632
I, uh, I...
You know, I'm-I'm sorry, Peter.

06:07.634 --> 06:10.168
I gotta... I gotta get back.

06:15.174 --> 06:16.774
I'm sorry, Lois!
I was a fool!

06:16.776 --> 06:20.244
I'm done with Kathy.
Can you ever forgive me?

06:20.246 --> 06:21.079
(sobbing)

06:21.081 --> 06:23.381
Peter, settle down.
Yes, I forgive you.

06:23.383 --> 06:25.750
Just as long as you're done
with that stupid cutout.

06:25.752 --> 06:29.287
I just want you to know that
every time I was with her,

06:29.289 --> 06:31.322
I was thinking of you.

06:32.191 --> 06:33.257
Peter, stop.

06:33.259 --> 06:35.727
Come on. I'm not in the mood.

06:35.729 --> 06:38.096
Oh.
(laughing)

06:38.098 --> 06:40.264
Oh, Peter!

06:40.266 --> 06:41.432
Oh, Lois, I missed you.

06:41.434 --> 06:44.235
You and your wonderful smile
and your beautiful eyes

06:44.237 --> 06:47.538
and your awesome third boob
that's on top of the other boob.

06:47.540 --> 06:49.574
What? Oh, my God!

06:49.576 --> 06:51.509
Peter, that's not a boob.

06:51.511 --> 06:52.643
That's a lump!

06:52.645 --> 06:54.112
A lump? Holy crap!

06:54.114 --> 06:56.848
(moaning)

06:56.850 --> 06:58.116
Peter, stop that!

06:58.118 --> 06:59.350
We're not having sex!

06:59.352 --> 07:00.451
I just told you I have a lump.

07:00.453 --> 07:04.155
I got a lump too, and
mine's easier to get rid of.

07:07.192 --> 07:08.960
Mrs. Griffin, I've
got good news.

07:08.962 --> 07:10.928
Your test results
came back negative.

07:10.930 --> 07:12.597
It appears the lump
in your breast

07:12.599 --> 07:14.599
is not black
gross boob death.

07:14.601 --> 07:15.533
Breast cancer?

07:15.535 --> 07:17.235
That's the
layman's term, yes.

07:17.237 --> 07:19.737
Oh, thank God!
What a relief.

07:19.739 --> 07:20.738
Yeah, that was scary.

07:20.740 --> 07:22.774
Now, Mrs. Griffin, although
you're in the clear

07:22.776 --> 07:24.375
for the moment, we
need to have a look

07:24.377 --> 07:28.212
at your family medical history
to determine your future risk.

07:28.214 --> 07:29.380
Huh. That's curious.

07:29.382 --> 07:32.383
I didn't realize your mother
was a Holocaust survivor.

07:32.385 --> 07:33.451
My mother?

07:33.453 --> 07:35.720
Oh, no,
that's-that's impossible.

07:35.722 --> 07:36.721
She's not Jewish.

07:36.723 --> 07:39.323
According to her birth
certificate, she is.

07:39.325 --> 07:41.459
Oh, my God.

07:41.461 --> 07:42.293
Wow.

07:42.295 --> 07:45.263
Breast cancer's starting
to look pretty good.

07:50.202 --> 07:51.602
Mom, you're Jewish?

07:51.604 --> 07:53.471
I'm sorry I never
told you, dear.

07:53.473 --> 07:57.341
When we were married, your
father made me conceal the fact

07:57.343 --> 07:59.410
so he could get
into country clubs.

07:59.412 --> 08:00.611
It was the right thing to do.

08:00.613 --> 08:03.581
It was the right
thing to do, dear.

08:03.583 --> 08:04.549
Oh, my God.

08:04.551 --> 08:06.751
So Grandma Hebrewberg
is actually Jewish?

08:06.753 --> 08:10.955
Yes, when she moved to America,
her family changed their name.

08:10.957 --> 08:14.325
It was originally
Hebrewbergmoneygrabber.

08:14.327 --> 08:16.327
That makes you Jewish, Lois.

08:16.329 --> 08:17.495
And your children, too.

08:17.497 --> 08:19.230
Well, this kind of
rocks my world.

08:19.232 --> 08:23.234
Even more than the time
I went to that pediatrician.

08:23.236 --> 08:24.001
Whoa, Stewie!

08:24.003 --> 08:26.370
You're getting
to be a big boy!

08:26.372 --> 08:28.940
I think somebody's going
to be a football star!

08:28.942 --> 08:30.341
(laughing):
Oh, you.

08:30.343 --> 08:31.943
Oops. Forgot your chart.

08:31.945 --> 08:32.944
Be right back.

08:32.946 --> 08:34.679
PEDIATRICIAN:
Whoa, Jason!

08:34.681 --> 08:36.581
You're getting
to be a big boy.

08:36.583 --> 08:39.617
I think somebody's going
to be a football star.

08:39.619 --> 08:41.519
I can't believe
I fell for that line.

08:41.521 --> 08:44.922
I actually let myself believe
I could be a doctor's wife.

08:44.924 --> 08:46.891
You're just fat, Stewie.

08:46.893 --> 08:48.826
Silly and fat.

08:51.697 --> 08:53.397
Uh, thank you for
coming over, Max.

08:53.399 --> 08:56.634
I really need some advice
from an actual Jewish person.

08:56.636 --> 08:57.835
Oh, it's my pleasure, Lois.

08:57.837 --> 09:00.471
I'm sure this all
must be very overwhelming.

09:00.473 --> 09:02.707
I just don't know what to
do with this information.

09:02.709 --> 09:04.942
I-I've spent my whole
life as a Christian.

09:04.944 --> 09:07.645
I'll tell you what you should do
with it: absolutely nothing.

09:07.647 --> 09:08.846
That's the problem
with this world.

09:08.848 --> 09:11.782
Too many people go overboard
with what they believe.

09:11.784 --> 09:12.884
Like Quagmire when he thought

09:12.886 --> 09:14.719
he was the one
getting the spin-off.

09:14.721 --> 09:15.920
See you later, bitches!

09:15.922 --> 09:18.723
Have fun with your stupid
(bleep) giant chicken jokes

09:18.725 --> 09:19.690
and your Conway Twitty...

09:19.692 --> 09:22.360
Hey, why is there a moving truck
outside Cleveland's house?

09:22.362 --> 09:24.529
Well, I wouldn't put it
quite like that,

09:24.531 --> 09:25.730
but essentially, Brian's right.

09:25.732 --> 09:28.432
Being Jewish doesn't
really have to change you

09:28.434 --> 09:29.667
or your family's life.

09:29.669 --> 09:30.902
Well, I guess you're right.

09:30.904 --> 09:34.539
There's no reason things should
be any different around here.

09:34.541 --> 09:35.573
Shalom, Jews!

09:35.575 --> 09:39.877
Wow, Dad, where did you get
all that glistening chest hair?

09:39.879 --> 09:41.445
It came with my
Star of David.

09:41.447 --> 09:42.413
Peter, what is all this?

09:42.415 --> 09:43.981
Look, this is my way
of letting you know

09:43.983 --> 09:45.850
that I'm embracing who you are.

09:45.852 --> 09:47.418
Oh, and I don't respond
to Peter.

09:47.420 --> 09:52.623
From now on, I want you to use
my Hebrew name, Hccccccchhhhh.

09:52.625 --> 09:56.894
Well, I-I caution you,
uh, Hccccccchhhhh,

09:56.896 --> 09:59.664
that becoming Jewish
doesn't happen overnight.

09:59.666 --> 10:02.800
It's a process that involves
spiritual education

10:02.802 --> 10:03.734
and good works.

10:03.736 --> 10:06.070
So what you're saying
is that it happens overnight?

10:06.072 --> 10:08.306
Look, Peter, I'm the one
with the Jewish heritage,

10:08.308 --> 10:10.775
and I really don't want
to make a big deal out of this.

10:10.777 --> 10:13.578
Leave it to a Jew to take
all the fun out of being a Jew.

10:13.580 --> 10:16.514
Now, listen up. I like the hat,
and I like the scarf.

10:16.516 --> 10:18.316
So we're doing this.

10:20.886 --> 10:24.922
Kids, from now on, this is where
we'll celebrate the Sabbath.

10:24.924 --> 10:26.824
Peter, this is
all unnecessary.

10:26.826 --> 10:28.659
Our life was fine
the way it was.

10:28.661 --> 10:31.395
Check it out. I'm one
of you guys now, huh?

10:31.397 --> 10:32.930
I'm Jewish! Yeah!

10:32.932 --> 10:34.532
Holocaust!
We're #1!

10:34.534 --> 10:36.634
Look at all these
short, hairy men.

10:36.636 --> 10:39.971
God, I feel like I'm
on the forest moon of Endor.

10:39.973 --> 10:40.972
Good afternoon.

10:40.974 --> 10:43.674
As we approach
the Passover holiday,

10:43.676 --> 10:45.543
let us remember the struggle
of our people

10:45.545 --> 10:49.614
as they labored under the yoke
of Pharaoh's despotic rule.

10:49.616 --> 10:53.417
Hey, if anyone appreciates
a good yoke, it's the yews.

10:53.419 --> 10:55.586
(laughing)

10:55.588 --> 10:57.922
That's my Jewish laugh. I'm
working on a Jewish laugh.

10:57.924 --> 11:00.424
Peter, I'm so
embarrassed right now.

11:00.426 --> 11:02.293
Can we please just go?

11:02.295 --> 11:04.362
Hi. You're pretty.

11:04.364 --> 11:06.330
Oh, thank you.

11:06.698 --> 11:09.967
Mom, is sodomy illegal
if you're Jewish?

11:09.969 --> 11:13.638
I hope so, Meg.
I really do.

11:13.640 --> 11:17.441
It's not, Lois.
It's not.

11:19.778 --> 11:22.847
Dad, this isn't
the way to school.

11:22.849 --> 11:23.814
Yes, it is, Chris.

11:23.816 --> 11:25.416
One of the best parts
about being Jewish

11:25.418 --> 11:27.718
is getting to take advantage
of their excellent schools.

11:27.720 --> 11:29.153
I'm not going
to no Jewish school.

11:29.155 --> 11:32.256
Sitting around all day with
a bunch of short, hairy guys.

11:32.258 --> 11:34.492
I'll feel like I'm on
the forest moon of Endor.

11:34.494 --> 11:38.162
Didn't you... didn't you make
that joke the other day?

11:38.164 --> 11:39.096
Oh. Yeah.

11:39.098 --> 11:41.532
No, I just wasn't sure
if everybody had,

11:41.534 --> 11:45.536
um... had heard.

11:47.039 --> 11:48.939
And instead of
lasting for one day,

11:48.941 --> 11:51.909
the oil in the lamp
lasted for eight days.

11:51.911 --> 11:54.078
And that is why we
celebrate Hanukkah.

11:54.080 --> 11:55.713
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
how long before we play

11:55.715 --> 11:58.049
"pin the eviction notice
on the black guy's door"?

11:58.051 --> 11:59.750
Now, does anyone have
any questions?

11:59.752 --> 12:01.185
Yeah, I have a question--
what are you gonna do

12:01.187 --> 12:03.988
when Jesus comes back
and puts a boot up your ass?

12:03.990 --> 12:05.623
And it's also why many families

12:05.625 --> 12:08.092
give their children
eight days of presents.

12:08.094 --> 12:11.262
Wait, did she say
eight days of presents?

12:11.264 --> 12:11.562
Yeah.

12:11.564 --> 12:13.898
Well, this Judaism thing is
gonna be better than I thought.

12:13.900 --> 12:16.867
All right, class, that's
all for today's lesson.

12:16.869 --> 12:18.102
Now everyone off
to gym class.

12:18.104 --> 12:21.872
All right, today we're
gonna play soccer.

12:28.547 --> 12:30.815
Huh. That was easy.

12:33.952 --> 12:36.053
Hey, Lois, the kids
are all asleep.

12:36.055 --> 12:38.022
I suppose they are.

12:38.024 --> 12:39.190
(chuckles)

12:39.192 --> 12:40.091
You know what else?

12:40.093 --> 12:42.193
I picked out a sexy
little Jewish outfit

12:42.195 --> 12:43.828
for you at the store.

12:43.830 --> 12:45.096
What is that?

12:45.098 --> 12:45.896
Oh, my God, Lois,

12:45.898 --> 12:48.766
if you put on this long, thick
dress right now, I will lose it.

12:48.768 --> 12:49.934
Peter, I'm not
wearing that thing.

12:49.936 --> 12:51.502
And if you put this shawl
over your head...

12:51.504 --> 12:54.505
Ooh, do you have any clunky,
unfashionable peasant shoes?

12:54.507 --> 12:58.676
Oh, I swear to God, Lois,
I swear to God, I would lose it.

12:58.678 --> 12:59.643
Peter, get off me!

12:59.645 --> 13:03.481
Tell me I don't earn as much
as your friend's husband.

13:03.483 --> 13:04.915
Peter, stop it!

13:04.917 --> 13:05.883
I'm going to sleep.

13:05.885 --> 13:08.185
Fine. I'll just sit
here and watch TV.

13:08.187 --> 13:13.724
MAN:
We now return to Mark Wahlberg
in <i>Annoyed and Confused.</i>

13:13.726 --> 13:15.926
What? What's going on?

13:15.928 --> 13:17.061
I don't get it.

13:17.063 --> 13:18.662
Man, I gotta work out.

13:18.664 --> 13:20.131
What's going on here?

13:20.133 --> 13:21.432
Where am I?

13:21.434 --> 13:22.800
What the... Huh?

13:22.802 --> 13:24.702
What the hell's going on here?

13:24.704 --> 13:26.470
Huh?! What?!

13:31.710 --> 13:35.045
FRANCIS (voice echoing):
Peter.

13:37.416 --> 13:37.982
Dad?

13:37.984 --> 13:40.117
What do you think
you're doing, Peter?

13:40.119 --> 13:41.252
You were raised Catholic.

13:41.254 --> 13:46.123
If you forsake your religion,
you'll spend eternity in Hell.

13:46.125 --> 13:47.625
Oh, God. I don't want that.

13:47.627 --> 13:49.960
Then you better knock off
all the Jewish stuff.

13:49.962 --> 13:53.898
Well... all right, if that's
what you think is best.

13:54.733 --> 13:55.900
Oh, wait, Dad, before you go,

13:55.902 --> 13:59.103
can you say, "Peter, you must
go to the Dagobah System"?

13:59.105 --> 14:03.874
Peter, you must go
to the Dagobah System.

14:03.876 --> 14:06.510
Ah. Thanks.

14:11.349 --> 14:15.019
Anybody want
toast or a bagel?

14:15.021 --> 14:16.854
Peter, what the hell?!

14:16.856 --> 14:18.856
Lois, last night,
my father came to me

14:18.858 --> 14:20.658
and reminded me that
I'm a good Catholic.

14:20.660 --> 14:22.993
If I don't rid the house
of this Jewish curse,

14:22.995 --> 14:24.762
this family is
gonna go to Hell,

14:24.764 --> 14:25.930
and I won't let that happen.

14:25.932 --> 14:27.097
Peter, you were
the only one

14:27.099 --> 14:29.166
who was even taking
this thing seriously.

14:29.168 --> 14:30.134
Jews are gross, Lois.

14:30.136 --> 14:32.703
It's the only religion
with the word "ew" in it.

14:32.705 --> 14:34.071
Oh, come on, you're
acting crazier

14:34.073 --> 14:37.208
than when you were going
through your Parker Lewis phase.

14:37.210 --> 14:38.409
Peter, you ready
for dinner?

14:38.411 --> 14:40.277
Oh, that's just like
the Parker Lewis episode

14:40.279 --> 14:41.979
when Parker Lewis
ate dinner.

14:41.981 --> 14:44.515
Peter, nobody cares
about your canceled show.

14:44.517 --> 14:47.017
Lois, Parker Lewis
can't lose.

14:47.019 --> 14:48.652
Don't even try
and make him lose

14:48.654 --> 14:50.821
'cause it's just going to be
that much more embarrassing

14:50.823 --> 14:53.023
for you when you realize
that he can't lose.

14:53.025 --> 14:54.959
Would he win
in a fight with Batman?

14:54.961 --> 14:57.194
Well, Chris, think about
what you're saying.

14:57.196 --> 14:58.929
Parker Lewis can't lose.

14:58.931 --> 15:01.632
Heretofore, Batman
can suck on that.

15:01.634 --> 15:03.868
Suck on that?
Suck on this.

15:03.870 --> 15:06.337
Tic-Tacs only have
one and a half calories.

15:06.339 --> 15:07.671
Well played.

15:07.673 --> 15:08.973
I love you, Dad.

15:08.975 --> 15:11.242
I love you too, son.

15:19.184 --> 15:20.851
Mm...
Huh?

15:20.853 --> 15:22.620
What the...
what the hell?

15:22.622 --> 15:25.155
How do you like it? Huh?
How do you like it?

15:25.157 --> 15:27.024
Peter, what in
God's name is this?

15:27.026 --> 15:30.861
Wait a minute, are these
pieces of Stewie's crib?

15:30.863 --> 15:32.830
I hate it here.

15:34.966 --> 15:37.768
Oh, thanks for spending
time with me today, Mom.

15:37.770 --> 15:39.803
I just had to get
out of that house.

15:39.805 --> 15:41.071
Peter's being
such a jackass.

15:41.073 --> 15:44.742
Lois, I think this is more
serious than you realize.

15:44.744 --> 15:46.277
Don't you see
what he's doing?

15:46.279 --> 15:48.145
Oh, he's just
being immature.

15:48.147 --> 15:50.214
It's happened before,
and it'll pass.

15:50.216 --> 15:51.949
Lois, what Peter
is doing to you

15:51.951 --> 15:54.785
is exactly what Carter
did to me for years.

15:54.787 --> 15:58.088
He's repressing
your Jewish identity.

15:58.090 --> 15:58.989
(Carter chuckles)

15:58.991 --> 16:02.259
But, Mom, I don't really
care about being Jewish.

16:02.261 --> 16:04.028
Or even Christian,
for that matter.

16:04.030 --> 16:06.697
I just wanna be a good
person, on my own.

16:06.699 --> 16:07.631
(Carter chuckles)

16:07.633 --> 16:11.936
All I'm saying is I let your
father take my Jewish identity,

16:11.938 --> 16:14.038
and I've regretted
it ever since.

16:14.040 --> 16:16.740
I don't want to see you
make the same mistake.

16:16.742 --> 16:19.677
I don't know, Mom.
I'll think about it.

16:19.679 --> 16:20.711
(chuckles)

16:20.713 --> 16:21.779
Carter, knock it off.

16:21.781 --> 16:24.348
Come on, you know you Jew
girls want that dollar.

16:24.350 --> 16:26.917
Follow the dollar,
and it'll lead you to... um...

16:26.919 --> 16:28.152
What do... what
do Jews like?

16:28.154 --> 16:30.020
Salmon. There's
salmon over here.

16:30.022 --> 16:31.822
Is there really
salmon over there?

16:31.824 --> 16:32.590
No.

16:32.592 --> 16:36.160
You walk over there and he
squirts you with a squirt gun.

16:36.162 --> 16:38.829
(laughing)

16:51.209 --> 16:53.944
(gunshot)
Aah! What the hell?!

16:59.117 --> 17:01.118
(sighs)

17:01.120 --> 17:03.087
Are you out of
your (bleep) mind?

17:03.089 --> 17:05.155
Relax, Lois. I was aiming
for the mailbox.

17:05.157 --> 17:07.157
I'm just trying
to make a point.

17:07.159 --> 17:08.292
Good morning, Lois.

17:08.294 --> 17:09.360
(gunshot)
(screams)

17:09.362 --> 17:10.794
Peter, for God's sake!

17:10.796 --> 17:12.229
I am so sorry, Mort.

17:12.231 --> 17:13.097
No problem, Lois.

17:13.099 --> 17:14.331
That's how people
say hello to me.

17:14.333 --> 17:17.801
(gunshot)
Hey, Joe.
Hey, Mort.

17:20.038 --> 17:22.406
Peter, you and I are gonna
have a conversation.

17:22.408 --> 17:23.741
I'm very angry with you.

17:23.743 --> 17:24.908
Geez, what's your problem?

17:24.910 --> 17:28.245
What you did this morning was
so far out of line I just...

17:28.247 --> 17:29.780
Let me tell you this.

17:29.782 --> 17:30.848
Mom was right.

17:30.850 --> 17:34.351
I can't just sit here and let
you dump all over my heritage.

17:34.353 --> 17:36.987
I'm not gonna make
the mistake she did.

17:36.989 --> 17:38.922
I'm Jewish, and I'm proud of it.

17:38.924 --> 17:41.392
And this weekend
we're having a Passover seder.

17:41.394 --> 17:43.160
You can't do that. It's Easter.

17:43.162 --> 17:44.228
Not in this house.

17:44.230 --> 17:46.797
Lois, this family believes
in the Easter Bunny.

17:46.799 --> 17:48.932
He died for our sins
in that helicopter crash.

17:48.934 --> 17:50.834
Now, if you wanna go
to Hell, that's fine,

17:50.836 --> 17:53.137
but don't drag the rest
of us down with you

17:53.139 --> 17:55.305
like a mentally
handicapped rooster.

17:55.307 --> 17:56.840
Cock-a-doodle-doo.

17:56.842 --> 17:58.809
Cock-a-doodle-doo.

17:58.811 --> 18:01.879
Good night, everybody.

18:04.749 --> 18:05.549
Okay, everyone.

18:05.551 --> 18:07.551
This is my first time
doing a seder,

18:07.553 --> 18:10.788
which is where we tell the story
of the Jews' escape

18:10.790 --> 18:12.056
from bondage in Egypt.

18:12.058 --> 18:14.124
Doesn't it seem like
every Jewish holiday

18:14.126 --> 18:16.760
has to do with them
escaping from stuff?

18:16.762 --> 18:17.428
No, Chris.

18:17.430 --> 18:21.165
And you know, tricking some
bigger, more athletic people?

18:21.167 --> 18:22.900
Uh, Lois, not that
I'm rushing you,

18:22.902 --> 18:25.035
but when do we get
to the wine drinking?

18:25.037 --> 18:25.969
Hang on, hang on.

18:25.971 --> 18:27.137
Before we do anything,

18:27.139 --> 18:29.273
I'd like to say a blessing
over the candles if I may.

18:29.275 --> 18:31.542
Now bear with me, I haven't
had much rehearsal time.

18:31.544 --> 18:32.676
(clearing throat)

18:32.678 --> 18:37.381
<i>♪ Barukh atah adonai</i>
<i>elohaynu melekh halahm ♪</i>

18:37.383 --> 18:40.584
<i>♪ A-share kiddy shahnu</i>
<i>bimitzvah tov ♪</i>

18:40.586 --> 18:44.488
<i>♪ Vitsee vanu l'hahdlic</i>
<i>nare, shell yom tov... ♪</i>

18:44.490 --> 18:46.557
Can't we just eat?

18:46.559 --> 18:48.992
And now I shall
continue the prayer.

18:48.994 --> 18:50.894
<i>Kali mah.</i>

18:50.896 --> 18:53.397
<i>Kali mah.</i>

18:53.399 --> 18:54.331
<i>Kali mah.</i>

18:54.333 --> 18:56.233
<i>Hum num shevai,</i>
<i>hum num shevai,</i>

18:56.235 --> 18:58.302
<i>hum num shevai, hum num</i>
<i>shevai, hum num shevai.</i>

18:58.304 --> 19:01.472
Now let's move on
to the washing of the hands.

19:01.474 --> 19:03.974
This is a very important
part of the ceremo...

19:03.976 --> 19:06.577
Hey, hey, hey.
The Easter Bunny is here.

19:06.579 --> 19:08.045
Happy Easter.

19:08.047 --> 19:10.280
Peter, what the hell
are you doing in that...?

19:10.282 --> 19:11.582
Have you been drinking?

19:11.584 --> 19:13.383
Not since I got
out of the car.

19:13.385 --> 19:15.285
Who here thinks they
can kick my ass?

19:15.287 --> 19:17.387
Peter, you are not
gonna ruin this seder.

19:17.389 --> 19:18.489
Now get out of here.

19:18.491 --> 19:23.026
I'm sorry, kids, I just wanted
to help Brian run for mayor.

19:23.028 --> 19:26.396
I guess I forgot what
was really important.

19:26.398 --> 19:27.498
Peter, just go lie down.

19:27.500 --> 19:29.066
All right, I'm gonna
go lie down

19:29.068 --> 19:31.568
and then I'm gonna come back
and mess up your seder.

19:31.570 --> 19:34.271
All right, I'm back,
and I'm much more sober.

19:34.273 --> 19:35.639
Lois, what you're
doing is wrong.

19:35.641 --> 19:38.475
I want you to get all this
Jew food off the table.

19:38.477 --> 19:39.710
I most certainly
will not.

19:39.712 --> 19:41.478
It's me or your
religion, Lois.

19:41.480 --> 19:44.114
I'm a Catholic and I want
to live in a Catholic house.

19:44.116 --> 19:46.817
Well, I'm a Jew and I want
to live in a nicer house.

19:46.819 --> 19:48.619
BRIAN:
You really think
I should run for mayor?

19:48.621 --> 19:51.421
Peter, you gotta stop living
in your own stupid world.

19:51.423 --> 19:53.457
I'm sorry, but I can't
be with someone

19:53.459 --> 19:54.958
who doesn't
believe in Jesus.

19:54.960 --> 19:56.860
Hey, hey,
heard my name.

19:56.862 --> 19:57.528
Wow, Jesus!

19:57.530 --> 19:59.163
Aw, you're dead
now, Lois.

19:59.165 --> 20:00.230
Jesus is gonna kill ya,

20:00.232 --> 20:02.266
and then we're gonna bury you
in the yard

20:02.268 --> 20:04.601
next to Kathy Ireland...
(sputtering)

20:04.603 --> 20:06.203
I mean, uh, nice weather
we're having.

20:06.205 --> 20:08.605
Look, Peter, I thought it
might interest you to know

20:08.607 --> 20:10.073
that I'm Jewish.

20:10.075 --> 20:11.041
What?

20:11.043 --> 20:12.176
He's Jewish, Peter.

20:12.178 --> 20:15.412
Jewish, like full-on?
Like you practice Jewie-ism?

20:15.414 --> 20:16.580
I am a Jew.

20:16.582 --> 20:17.314
Prove it.

20:17.316 --> 20:19.917
What's a nine percent
tip on a $200 bill?

20:19.919 --> 20:22.219
$18. Which is fair.

20:22.221 --> 20:23.587
Oh, my God, it's true.

20:23.589 --> 20:24.655
But I'm so confused.

20:24.657 --> 20:26.423
Peter, it really
doesn't matter.

20:26.425 --> 20:29.193
Catholicism and Judaism
are not that different.

20:29.195 --> 20:31.261
They're two sides
of the same coin.

20:31.263 --> 20:32.329
In fact, the Last Supper,

20:32.331 --> 20:35.332
one of the most iconic images
of the Catholic faith,

20:35.334 --> 20:36.567
was a Passover seder.

20:36.569 --> 20:37.534
And if I'm not mistaken,

20:37.536 --> 20:39.536
Islam is also in that same
spiritual family...

20:39.538 --> 20:41.505
Uh, let's not muddy
things up here.

20:41.507 --> 20:44.441
The most important thing
is to treat other people

20:44.443 --> 20:46.944
the same way you would
want to be treated.

20:46.946 --> 20:49.046
Oh, an eye for an eye.

20:49.048 --> 20:52.349
Well, Lois, I guess
I owe you an apology.

20:52.351 --> 20:54.585
I was scared because
my dad convinced me

20:54.587 --> 20:55.652
I was going to Hell.

20:55.654 --> 20:58.255
And I was doing it to make up
for my mother's mistake.

20:58.257 --> 21:00.457
Look, I don't know
if being Jewish

21:00.459 --> 21:02.459
is the right thing
for our family.

21:02.461 --> 21:04.628
I just wanted the chance
to explore it

21:04.630 --> 21:05.762
so I could know for sure.

21:05.764 --> 21:08.599
But, to tell you the truth,
I thought we were fine before.

21:08.601 --> 21:11.468
But then, Jesus, which religion
should our family be?

21:11.470 --> 21:14.271
Six or one... they're
all complete crap.

21:14.273 --> 21:16.440
BRIAN:
Thank you.
