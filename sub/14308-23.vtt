OUT OF HERE?

00:14.200 --> 00:15.233
- NO!

00:15.267 --> 00:16.267
HE'S DROPPING OFF

00:16.300 --> 00:17.800
MY EXPLODING HEAD MAGIC TRICK.

00:17.833 --> 00:20.533

00:28.900 --> 00:30.767
A MINT?

00:30.800 --> 00:32.267
THAT'S YOUR TIP?

00:32.300 --> 00:34.367
- CONSIDER IT MORE
OF A RECOMMENDATION.

00:34.400 --> 00:37.533
- RECOMMEND THIS.

00:39.667 --> 00:41.267
- ALL RIGHT, RAY.

00:41.300 --> 00:43.767
HE'S ALL YOURS.

00:43.800 --> 00:47.367

01:03.367 --> 01:06.200
I'M BEING CONSIDERED
FOR THE BOO CREW.

01:07.367 --> 01:08.800
- IT'S A CLUB FOR GHOST BOYS.

01:08.833 --> 01:10.900
IT'S A BIG HONOR
TO BE ASKED TO JOIN.

01:10.933 --> 01:12.400
- YES, FATHER.

01:12.433 --> 01:15.233
THAT IT IS.

01:15.267 --> 01:17.400
AND THE GUYS ARE COMING OVER
THIS AFTERNOON

01:17.433 --> 01:18.833
TO SEE IF I'M BOO CREW MATERIAL.

01:18.867 --> 01:22.533
THEY ONLY ACCEPT
THE BEST OF THE BEST.

01:22.567 --> 01:26.100
- SO WHY ARE THEY
CONSIDERING YOU?

01:26.133 --> 01:28.567
- I DID NOT JUST HEAR THAT.

01:28.600 --> 01:30.767
- I SAID, "SO WHY ARE THEY--"

01:30.800 --> 01:33.833
- ANYWAY,
THIS MEETING'S IMPORTANT.

01:33.867 --> 01:36.133
THAT MEANS NO HATHAWAYS
IN THE ATTIC.

01:36.167 --> 01:37.900
IF THE BOYS KNEW
I LIVE WITH YOU PEOPLE,

01:37.933 --> 01:39.333
I'D NEVER MAKE BOO CREW.

01:39.367 --> 01:40.733
- DON'T WORRY, LOUIE.

01:40.767 --> 01:41.800
WE WON'T INTERRUPT
YOUR LITTLE MEETING.

01:41.833 --> 01:43.300

01:43.333 --> 01:45.200
'CAUSE ONCE THE L-TRAIN
JOINS THE CLUB,

01:45.233 --> 01:48.900
WE'LL BE THE BADDEST, SCARIEST
HAUNTING CREW AROUND.

01:51.900 --> 01:53.500
MM.

01:53.533 --> 01:55.400
JUST WANTED TO GET THIS
OUT OF MY SYSTEM

01:55.433 --> 01:57.633
BEFORE THE BIG MEETING.

01:57.667 --> 02:00.200
GOOD TO GO NOW.

02:06.500 --> 02:08.667

HOW WE ENDED UP THIS WAY *

02:08.700 --> 02:10.367

YOU COULD CALL US *

02:10.400 --> 02:12.567
- * THE HAUNTED HATHAWAYS

02:18.400 --> 02:19.367
DEANA IS THINKING ABOUT

02:19.400 --> 02:20.467
BREAKING UP WITH ZACK,

02:20.500 --> 02:22.233
BUT SHE HASN'T TOLD HIM YET.

02:23.333 --> 02:24.467
DEANA CAN'T DO THAT!

02:24.500 --> 02:25.833
ZACK'S ALREADY RENTED HIS TUX

02:25.867 --> 02:28.400
FOR THE BIG DANCE.

02:28.433 --> 02:31.333
- NOT NOW.
SHOO! SHOO!

02:31.367 --> 02:33.300
OH, SORRY, IT'S THIS PESKY FLY.

02:33.333 --> 02:34.533
HE WON'T MIND HIS OWN BUSINESS.

02:34.567 --> 02:36.700
SHOO!

02:36.733 --> 02:38.733
"

02:38.767 --> 02:42.133
I'LL SHOW YOU A PESKY FLY.

02:47.300 --> 02:50.267
HEY, TAY, WHAT'S THE BUZZ?

02:50.300 --> 02:53.300
IS THIS DIZZTRACTING?

02:53.333 --> 02:56.433
- STOP IT! STOP IT!

02:56.467 --> 02:58.200
UH...

02:58.233 --> 02:59.767
THIS FLY IS DRIVING ME CRAZY.

02:59.800 --> 03:01.233
LET'S GO SOMEWHERE ELZZZ.

03:01.267 --> 03:03.200
ELSE.

03:09.767 --> 03:10.933
- HMM.

03:10.967 --> 03:13.433
THAT'S STRANGE.

03:13.467 --> 03:15.167
- OW!

03:15.200 --> 03:16.567
WHIPLASH!
CONCUSSION!

03:16.600 --> 03:18.467
EMOTIONAL DISTRESS!

03:18.500 --> 03:19.967
- OH, MY GOSH!
SIR, ARE YOU OKAY?

03:20.067 --> 03:22.167
- DID YOU NOT HEAR THE WORDS
"WHIPLASH, CONCUSSION,

03:22.200 --> 03:23.467
AND EMOTIONAL DISTRESS"?

03:23.500 --> 03:25.633
I SLIPPED ON THIS
SPILLED LEMONADE.

03:25.667 --> 03:26.733
- JUST STAY STILL.

03:26.767 --> 03:28.267
I WILL CALL FOR HELP.

03:28.300 --> 03:30.333
HELP!

03:30.367 --> 03:34.267
- YOU'RE THE ONE WHO'S GONNA
NEED HELP WHEN I SUE YOU.

03:34.300 --> 03:37.367
I'LL OWN THIS ENTIRE BUILDING
BY THE TIME I'M DONE.

03:37.400 --> 03:40.100
I'LL SEE YOU IN COURT.

03:40.133 --> 03:43.300
OH.
OW!

03:43.333 --> 03:44.467
- OH, THIS IS BAD.

03:44.500 --> 03:47.400
THIS IS REALLY BAD.

03:47.433 --> 03:48.833
- MICHELLE, DON'T WORRY.

03:48.867 --> 03:50.100
HE FAKED IT.

03:50.133 --> 03:51.333
THAT GUY'S A TOTAL SCAM ARTIST.

03:51.367 --> 03:52.633
ARE YOU SURE?

03:52.667 --> 03:54.400
HE WAS WEARING A SUIT.

03:54.433 --> 03:56.333
- I SAW THE WHOLE THING.

03:56.367 --> 03:58.133
- THEN THAT'S GREAT.

03:58.167 --> 04:00.300
WHEN HE TAKES ME TO COURT,
YOU CAN TELL THE JUDGE THAT--

04:00.333 --> 04:01.300
OH, WAIT, YOU'RE A GHOST.

04:01.333 --> 04:02.467
- I'M A GHOST.

04:04.200 --> 04:05.300
I CAN'T LOSE THE BAKERY.

04:05.333 --> 04:06.767
I'VE WORKED SO HARD TO MAKE THIS

04:06.800 --> 04:08.433
A WELCOMING FAMILY BUSINESS.

04:08.467 --> 04:09.867
- EXCUSE ME--
- NOT NOW!

04:09.900 --> 04:11.300
I AM IN THE MIDDLE
OF A CRISIS.

04:13.433 --> 04:14.933
I CANNOT HEAR MYSELF THINK!

04:17.867 --> 04:19.633
- SO ME AND THE BOYS,
WE WERE AT THE PARK,

04:19.667 --> 04:22.167
AND REGGIE HERE CREATES
A BIGFOOT ILLUSION.

04:22.200 --> 04:23.300
PEOPLE FREAKED.

04:23.333 --> 04:25.467
REGGIE, SHOW HIM.

04:29.500 --> 04:34.700
IS WHAT THOSE SILLY PEOPLE
PROBABLY SAID, RIGHT?

04:36.500 --> 04:38.467
- I BEEN WORKING ON A LITTLE
SOMETHING OF MY OWN.

04:38.500 --> 04:40.100
CHECK THIS OUT.

04:44.233 --> 04:47.333
- THAT, TOO, WAS IMPRESSIVE.

04:49.367 --> 04:52.200
- SO, PRESTON, YOU'RE UP.

04:52.233 --> 04:53.433
LET'S SEE WHAT YOU GOT.

04:53.467 --> 04:56.500
- SURE.
LET'S SEE.

04:56.533 --> 04:57.800
- JUST DO SOMETHING COOL.

04:57.833 --> 05:01.233
- OKAY, WELL,
THAT NARROWS IT DOWN.

05:09.267 --> 05:10.333
- AWESOME!

05:10.367 --> 05:11.767
YOU SHOULD PUNT IT.

05:11.800 --> 05:14.700
all: PUNT IT! PUNT IT! PUNT IT!

05:14.733 --> 05:16.667
PUNT IT! PUNT IT!
- OKAY.

05:16.700 --> 05:21.567
HEADS UP.

05:21.600 --> 05:24.567
WOO-HOO!
YES!

05:24.600 --> 05:26.500
SHOULD HAVE WORN A HELMET.

05:33.667 --> 05:34.633
YES, BIG GERT.

05:34.667 --> 05:37.400
I CAN HEAR THE FUN.

05:37.433 --> 05:38.500
- OH, MAN.

05:38.533 --> 05:40.500
WE ARE LAUGHING OUR HEADS OFF.

05:40.533 --> 05:43.233
GET IT?

05:43.267 --> 05:45.367
- GUESS YOU HAD TO BE THERE.

05:45.400 --> 05:47.700
- WELL, I'M NOT
TOO BUSY RIGHT NOW.

05:47.733 --> 05:49.567
SO IF YOU'RE INVITING
ME TO COME JOIN--

05:49.600 --> 05:50.767
- NO WAY.

05:50.800 --> 05:52.633
"A," YOU'RE NOT A GHOST.

05:52.667 --> 05:54.300
"B," YOU'RE NOT A BOY.

05:54.333 --> 05:58.533
AND "C," REFER TO "A" AND "B"!

05:58.567 --> 06:01.433
- MAN, I WISH I COULD SEE WHAT'S
GOING ON UP THERE,

06:01.467 --> 06:03.200
BUT WE PROMISED NOT TOO.

06:03.233 --> 06:05.967
WHAT'S THAT?

06:06.067 --> 06:07.167
WE NEVER PROMISED

06:07.200 --> 06:08.567
NOT TO GO UP THERE, FRANKIE.

06:08.600 --> 06:10.400
MOTHER DID, NOT US.

06:10.433 --> 06:12.967
WHY SHOULD MOTHER
ALWAYS GET HER WAY?

06:13.067 --> 06:15.767
OKAY, THIS IS GETTING CREEPY.

06:18.600 --> 06:20.767
- YOU KNOW, I WAS WORRIED
ABOUT TESTIFYING IN COURT,

06:20.800 --> 06:23.667
BUT THEN I REMEMBERED,
I'M A NATURAL PERFORMER.

06:23.700 --> 06:26.667
- YOU'VE NEVER PERFORMED
IN ANYTHING.

06:26.700 --> 06:29.967
- MM, SOMEONE'S FORGETTING MY
STINT AS "WOMAN NUMBER THREE"

06:30.067 --> 06:32.333
IN THAT CANADIAN SKIN RASH
INFOMERCIAL.

06:32.367 --> 06:36.467
USE ONLY AS DIRECTED.

06:36.500 --> 06:38.733
- THAT WAS--

06:38.767 --> 06:41.100
YEAH, YOU KNOW, WHY DON'T WE DO
A LITTLE MOCK TRIAL

06:41.133 --> 06:43.600
JUST TO BE SAFE?

06:51.367 --> 06:55.467
- OKAY, APPARENTLY
I'M THE JUDGE.

06:55.500 --> 06:58.400
THIS IS SO CUTE.

06:58.433 --> 06:59.400
- SILENCE!

06:59.433 --> 07:00.533
ORDER IN THE COURT!

07:02.767 --> 07:07.567
UH, SOMEBODY BROKE YOUR WATCH.

07:07.600 --> 07:10.600
BRING IN THE JURY.

07:10.633 --> 07:15.300
- WELL, THIS IS DEFINITELY
A JURY OF MY GOOD-LOOKING PEERS.

07:15.333 --> 07:18.533
HOW YOU DOING, HANDSOME?

07:18.567 --> 07:19.833
- AND WHO'S QUESTIONING

07:19.867 --> 07:21.833
THE WITNESS?

07:21.867 --> 07:23.267
- THAT'D BE ME, YOUR HONOR.

07:23.300 --> 07:26.667
MILES PRESTON, ESQUIRE,
AT YOUR SERVICE.

07:26.700 --> 07:30.800
- WILL THE WITNESS PLEASE STATE
HER NAME FOR THE RECORD?

07:30.833 --> 07:33.400
- MICHELLE BARBARELLA HATHAWAY.

07:37.200 --> 07:38.600
- OBJECTION, YOUR HONOR!

07:38.633 --> 07:41.500
- I'LL ALLOW IT.
IT'S HILARIOUS.

07:41.533 --> 07:43.267
- MY, MY.

07:43.300 --> 07:45.433
SURE IS A HOT ONE IN N'AWLINS.

07:45.467 --> 07:47.700
AIR'S AS THICK AS THE SWEET
SCENT OF HONEYSUCKLE

07:47.733 --> 07:49.367
ON A VINE.

07:49.400 --> 07:51.467
REMINDS ME OF A CERTAIN TIME
OF EVENING

07:51.500 --> 07:54.400
IN '09 WHEN THE FIREFLIES
LIT THE SKY

07:54.433 --> 07:55.867
LIKE THE FOURTH OF JULY.

07:55.900 --> 07:58.467
- OBJECTION.
I'M CONFUSED.

07:58.500 --> 08:00.500
- YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE
IS CONFUSING?

08:00.533 --> 08:01.933
YOUR STORY.

08:01.967 --> 08:04.533
BUT I HAVEN'T TOLD MY STORY.

08:06.233 --> 08:08.267
'CAUSE YOU HADN'T
HAD TIME TO MAKE IT UP?

08:10.067 --> 08:11.367
N-NO!
NO, NO, NO.

08:11.400 --> 08:13.233
I HAVEN'T MADE ANYTHING UP YET.

08:13.267 --> 08:14.233
I MEAN--NO, NO, NO.
NO, NO.

08:14.267 --> 08:15.400
NOT--NOT "NOT YET."

08:15.433 --> 08:16.833
I MEAN, WH--I MEAN--FINE!

08:16.867 --> 08:19.300
I DID IT!
TAKE EVERYTHING!

08:19.333 --> 08:22.233
BARBARELLA'S GOING
TO THE BIG HOUSE!

08:24.933 --> 08:27.200
- LOOK, LOUIE'S
NOT ONLY A GREAT GHOST,

08:27.233 --> 08:28.900
HE'S HILARIOUS TOO.

08:30.500 --> 08:33.500
OH.

08:33.533 --> 08:35.367
YUP.
THAT'S ME.

08:35.400 --> 08:36.667
TOTAL CRACK UP.

08:38.200 --> 08:39.733
SO AM I IN?

08:39.767 --> 08:44.233
- WE NEED TO HUDDLE.

08:46.600 --> 08:49.233
ROOM FOR ONE MORE GHOST BOY?

08:49.267 --> 08:50.433
WHAT ARE WE TALKING ABOUT?

08:50.467 --> 08:52.233
BURPS

08:52.267 --> 08:53.733
BECAUSE I GOT BOTH.

08:55.600 --> 08:58.233
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

08:58.267 --> 08:59.267
- THE NAME'S FRANK.

08:59.300 --> 09:00.367
I'M A FRIEND OF LOUIE'S.

09:00.400 --> 09:02.200
I JUST SNAPPED IN FROM NEW YORK,

09:02.233 --> 09:05.533
AND BOY ARE MY FINGERS TIRED.

09:05.567 --> 09:07.833
TOUGH CROWD.

09:07.867 --> 09:10.500
- NO ONE CRASHES A BOO CREW
MEETING, FRANK.

09:10.533 --> 09:13.400
- UH, PLEASE EXCUSE
MY BUDDY HERE.

09:13.433 --> 09:15.500
HE'S A VERY CONFUSED LITTLE...

09:15.533 --> 09:17.567
BOY?

09:17.600 --> 09:18.867
- WELL, IF HE WANTS TO STAY,

09:18.900 --> 09:20.867
HE HAS TO PROVE
HE'S A WORTHY GHOST.

09:22.267 --> 09:26.533
WATCH THIS.

09:31.267 --> 09:35.467
I CALL IT MY
EXPLODING HEAD TRICK.

09:35.500 --> 09:38.433
- WE NEED TO HUDDLE.

09:38.467 --> 09:40.267
- WHAT DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE DOING?

09:40.300 --> 09:41.933
YOU'RE GONNA BLOW THIS FOR ME.

09:41.967 --> 09:42.933
- RELAX.

09:42.967 --> 09:44.400
THEY SUSPECT NOTHING.

09:44.433 --> 09:46.433
- PRESTON, GET OVER HERE.

09:46.467 --> 09:48.533
WELCOME TO BOO CREW!

09:50.567 --> 09:51.533
YES!

09:51.567 --> 09:53.600
GREATEST DAY EVER!

09:53.633 --> 09:55.333
- OH, AND ONE OTHER THING.

09:55.367 --> 09:56.967
FRANK, YOU'RE IN TOO.

09:57.067 --> 09:58.767
- YES!

09:58.800 --> 10:02.967
- NO!

10:03.000 --> 10:07.333
...BODY COULD BE HAPPIER
THAN ME RIGHT NOW.

10:13.033 --> 10:15.533
- LATER, BILLY, REGGIE,
STINKY PETE.

10:15.567 --> 10:18.233
I'D COME WITH YOU, BUT I NOTICED
A LITTLE STUBBLE.

10:18.267 --> 10:22.200
I'M GONNA HANG BACK AND SHAVE
THE OLD 'STACHE.

10:22.233 --> 10:23.200
- BYE, GUYS.

10:23.233 --> 10:24.200
THANKS AGAIN.

10:24.233 --> 10:25.367
TAKE CARE NOW.

10:25.400 --> 10:27.267
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?

10:27.300 --> 10:29.167
- YOU GUYS WERE PUNTING
A GHOST HEAD.

10:29.200 --> 10:30.633
WHAT WAS I SUPPOSED TO DO?

10:30.667 --> 10:33.167
NOT DRESS UP LIKE A BOY
AND COME UP HERE?

10:36.067 --> 10:39.133
- LOOKS LIKE SOMEONE NEEDS
TO SING THE BOO CREW ANTHEM.

10:39.167 --> 10:41.067
* WE'RE A MERRY BAND
OF SCARY-- *

10:41.100 --> 10:42.700
- ENOUGH!

10:42.733 --> 10:46.433
LOOK, IF YOU STICK AROUND,
THEY'LL EVENTUALLY REALIZE

10:46.467 --> 10:48.633
YOU'RE NOT A GHOST
AND I'LL BE KICKED OUT.

10:48.667 --> 10:49.733
- EASY, LOUIE.

10:49.767 --> 10:53.133
DON'T GET ALL BENT OUT OF SHAPE.

10:53.167 --> 10:54.767
- I CAN'T HELP IT.

10:54.800 --> 10:56.367
I REALLY WANT THIS.

10:56.400 --> 10:58.267
- FINE.
I'LL DROP OUT.

10:58.300 --> 11:00.467
- THANK YOU.

11:00.500 --> 11:03.100
- YOU HAVE NO IDEA HOW TO GET
YOURSELF BACK TO NORMAL, DO YOU?

11:03.133 --> 11:05.133
- NOT A CLUE.

11:11.667 --> 11:13.600
- JUST WALKED IN.

11:13.633 --> 11:16.233
- MOM IS GONNA BE A DISASTER
ON THE WITNESS STAND

11:16.267 --> 11:17.600
SO OUR ONLY SHOT AT WINNING

11:17.633 --> 11:19.433
IS PROVING THIS GUY
IS NOT REALLY INJURED.

11:21.167 --> 11:23.300
- I WENT DOWNTOWN AND GOT THIS
HIGH-TECH HIDDEN CAMERA

11:23.333 --> 11:24.300
TO CATCH HIM IN THE ACT.

11:24.333 --> 11:28.100
- OH.

11:28.133 --> 11:31.100
EH...THAT'S YOUR HIGH-TECH
HIDDEN CAMERA?

11:31.133 --> 11:34.400
- YES, THAT'S MY
HIGH-TECH HIDDEN CAMERA.

11:34.433 --> 11:37.100
JUST NEED A PLACE
TO PLUG IT IN.

11:37.133 --> 11:41.367
- MM.

11:41.400 --> 11:45.667
- MR. CONRAD.

11:45.700 --> 11:47.333
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR COMING.

11:47.367 --> 11:49.067
I'M SURE--
- ZIP IT!

11:49.100 --> 11:52.067
THE ONLY THING THAT'S GONNA SAVE
YOUR BAKERY IS CASH.

11:52.100 --> 11:55.067
OR FANCY TEACUPS.

11:55.067 --> 11:56.067
I'M A COLLECTOR.

11:56.100 --> 11:58.300
JUST FORGET IT.
I WANT CASH.

11:58.333 --> 12:02.700
- BEFORE WE TALK NUMBERS...
OR TEACUPS,

12:02.733 --> 12:06.267
HOW ABOUT SOME
OVEN-FRESH COOKIES

12:06.300 --> 12:09.067
AND A GLASS OF FROSTY,
COLD MILK?

12:09.100 --> 12:11.600
- I CAN'T POSSIBLY REACH
FOR THE COOKIES.

12:11.633 --> 12:13.667
BROKEN ARMS, REMEMBER?

12:13.700 --> 12:16.133
- OF COURSE.
JUST ONE THING THOUGH.

12:16.167 --> 12:20.267
IF YOU HAVE BROKEN ARMS,
EXPLAIN THIS!

12:20.300 --> 12:22.800
YOU WERE SUPPOSED
TO CATCH THAT.

12:22.833 --> 12:25.467
- I'LL ADD "ATTACKED BY FRUIT"
TO MY CLAIM.

12:25.500 --> 12:27.200
- SORRY.

12:27.233 --> 12:31.800
I DIDN'T MEAN TO--THINK FAST!

12:31.833 --> 12:36.467
- I'M ON TO YOUR
LITTLE GAME, MISSY.

12:36.500 --> 12:37.633
OOPS.

12:37.667 --> 12:39.367
YOUR SPY CAMERA.

12:39.400 --> 12:43.100
TOO BAD YOU WON'T BE GETTING
THIS ON TAPE.

12:43.133 --> 12:44.567
MMM.

12:44.600 --> 12:45.567
MM-HMM.

12:45.600 --> 12:49.233
OH, I'LL TAKE SOME.

12:49.267 --> 12:53.067
SEE YA IN COURT.

12:53.100 --> 12:56.233
- I HATE THAT GUY.

12:56.267 --> 12:58.467
NOW IT'S JUST
OUR WORD AGAINST HIS.

12:58.500 --> 13:02.733
- YEAH, WORDS AREN'T
ALWAYS CONVINCING.

13:02.767 --> 13:03.733
BUT VIDEO IS.

13:03.767 --> 13:07.167
BOOM!

13:07.200 --> 13:09.333
I GOT THE WHOLE THING
ON MICHELLE'S PHONE.

13:09.367 --> 13:10.567
- YES!

13:10.600 --> 13:13.267
TOLD YOU MY PLAN WOULD WORK.

13:16.767 --> 13:17.733
- HEY, LOUIE.

13:17.767 --> 13:19.300
- GO AWAY.

13:19.333 --> 13:21.267
THE BOO CREW
WILL BE HERE ANY MINUTE.

13:21.300 --> 13:25.467
THEY'RE PRESENTING ME
WITH MY CLUB JACKET.

13:25.500 --> 13:26.467
- COOL.

13:26.500 --> 13:27.633
I THOUGHT I COULD SHOW YOU

13:27.667 --> 13:29.267
HOW TO DO
MY EXPLODING HEAD TRICK.

13:29.300 --> 13:31.067
- I DON'T NEED SOME
MAIL-ORDER MAGIC TRICK

13:31.100 --> 13:33.300
TO BLOW FIREWORKS
OUT OF MY NECK.

13:33.333 --> 13:34.433
OBSERVE.

13:38.333 --> 13:40.800
PLEASE GO.

13:45.500 --> 13:46.667
GUYS!

13:46.700 --> 13:48.367
WHAT'S UP?

13:48.400 --> 13:52.733
WHEW, THAT IS THE LAST TIME
I EAT EL GHOSTO LOCO.

13:52.767 --> 13:54.133
- CHECK IT OUT.

13:54.167 --> 13:55.167
PRETTY SWEET, HUH?

13:56.300 --> 13:58.300
IT'S THE MOST BEAUTIFUL THING

13:58.333 --> 14:00.567
I'VE EVER

14:00.600 --> 14:02.633
- OH, WE BROUGHT FRANK'S TOO.

14:02.667 --> 14:04.533
WHERE IS HE?

14:04.567 --> 14:06.767
- I SENT HIM AWAY.

14:06.800 --> 14:08.467
YOU CAN'T DECIDE
WHO'S IN THE CLUB.

14:08.500 --> 14:10.333
BESIDES, FRANK IS AWESOME.

14:10.367 --> 14:11.700
LET'S GO FIND HIM.

14:11.733 --> 14:13.133
- NO!

14:13.167 --> 14:14.133
I'LL GET HIM.

14:14.167 --> 14:16.733
YOU WAIT HERE.

14:16.767 --> 14:19.200
I'LL TAKE THAT.
- UH-UH.

14:19.233 --> 14:21.100
NOT UNTIL YOU GET FRANK.

14:21.133 --> 14:22.567
- BE RIGHT BACK.

14:26.500 --> 14:29.167
THAT WASN'T ME.

14:31.367 --> 14:33.133
- LOOK AT HIM.

14:33.167 --> 14:36.133
ALL SMUG WITH HIS STUPID,
FAKE BROKEN ARMS.

14:36.167 --> 14:38.467
THINKS HE'S GONNA
INTIMIDATE ME IN COURT.

14:38.500 --> 14:41.367
- YOU DO REALIZE I CAN HEAR
EVERYTHING YOU'RE SAYING.

14:41.400 --> 14:44.500
- NO, I DID NOT REALIZE THAT.

14:44.533 --> 14:46.567
- MOM, JUST RELAX,
TELL THE TRUTH,

14:46.600 --> 14:48.167
AND PRESENT YOUR EVIDENCE.

14:48.200 --> 14:50.067
- DON'T WORRY.
I GOT THIS.

14:50.100 --> 14:52.100
PRESSURE IS MY MIDDLE NAME.

14:52.133 --> 14:54.700
- WELL, IT'S BETTER THAN
BARBARELLA.

14:54.733 --> 14:56.167
- ALL RISE.

14:56.200 --> 14:58.700
THE HONORABLE SUSAN SMILEY
PRESIDING.

15:04.533 --> 15:08.467
CONRAD VERSUS
PIE SQUARED BAKERY?

15:08.500 --> 15:11.500
- HI-SIES.

15:11.533 --> 15:14.067
PIES ARE ALL SQUARED.

15:14.067 --> 15:16.667
BUT IT--BUT IT'S ALSO
A MATH TERM,

15:16.700 --> 15:21.067
SO...

15:21.067 --> 15:22.267
I CAN'T TAKE THIS.

15:22.300 --> 15:23.300
I CONFESS!

15:23.333 --> 15:24.667
AND WHEN I WAS EIGHT

15:24.700 --> 15:26.433
I STOLE A DOLLAR FROM MY
NONNIE'S HANDBAG!

15:26.467 --> 15:30.400
I'M A MONSTER!

15:30.433 --> 15:31.767
- SHE ACTUALLY
HELD IT TOGETHER

15:31.800 --> 15:35.133
LONGER THAN I THOUGHT
SHE WOULD.

15:35.167 --> 15:39.400
- COME ON, BIG GERT, IT'S BEEN
TEN MINUTES SINCE MY MOVE.

15:39.433 --> 15:41.600
ALWAYS WITH THE HEAD GAMES.

15:41.633 --> 15:44.233
- CHANGE OF PLANS.

15:44.267 --> 15:46.200
I NEED YOU BACK UPSTAIRS.

15:46.233 --> 15:49.400
THEY WON'T GIVE ME MY BOO CREW
JACKET UNTIL I GET FRANK BACK.

15:49.433 --> 15:51.700
- OH, SO NOW
YOU NEED ME IN YOUR CLUB?

15:51.733 --> 15:55.367
I DON'T KNOW, I'M PRETTY BUSY.

15:57.800 --> 16:01.167
- CAN WE SKIP THE PART WHERE YOU
GIVE ME A HARD TIME

16:01.200 --> 16:04.267
AND JUMP TO WHERE YOU MAKE ME DO
SOMETHING STUPID SO YOU'LL HELP?

16:04.300 --> 16:07.867
- LOUIE, I WOULD
NEVER BE SO PETTY

16:07.900 --> 16:10.367
THAT I'D USE THIS MOMENT
TO HUMILIATE YOU.

16:10.400 --> 16:13.067
THANKS.

16:13.067 --> 16:17.400
- BIG GERT, HOWEVER...
IS NOT AS NICE.

16:17.433 --> 16:19.800
YOU WANNA BORROW MY BOY WIG?

16:19.833 --> 16:22.367
I'M GONNA NEED A LITTLE SUGAR.

16:22.400 --> 16:26.667
- TWISTED LITTLE GIRL.

16:26.700 --> 16:29.800
- AND I HAVE LIVED
EVERY DAY OF MY LIFE

16:29.833 --> 16:31.633
ASHAMED OF WHAT
I DID THAT NIGHT.

16:31.667 --> 16:34.567
- MISS HATHAWAY, I'M NOT
INTERESTED THAT IN FIFTH GRADE

16:34.600 --> 16:37.400
YOU PEEKED AT YOUR PRESENTS
ON CHRISTMAS EVE.

16:40.700 --> 16:42.433
- PERMISSION TO APPROACH
MY MOM?

16:42.467 --> 16:45.333
- IF IT'LL GET HER TO SHUT UP.

16:45.367 --> 16:47.167
- MOM, JUST PULL IT TOGETHER

16:47.200 --> 16:49.333
AND SHOW THE JUDGE
THE VIDEO ON YOUR PHONE.

16:49.367 --> 16:50.333
- OH, RIGHT.

16:50.367 --> 16:51.767
YOUR HONOR, I HAVE EVIDENCE

16:51.800 --> 16:54.267
THAT PROVES THIS MAN IS A FAKER.

16:54.300 --> 16:57.067
YOU'RE GOING DOWN, SUCKER.

16:57.100 --> 17:00.500
USE ONLY AS DIRECTED, EH?

17:00.533 --> 17:03.200
- THIS IS YOU TALKING
ABOUT A SKIN RASH.

17:03.233 --> 17:05.667
- AH, MY CANADIAN INFOMERCIAL.

17:05.700 --> 17:08.567
ONE TAKE.

17:08.600 --> 17:09.733
OH, UH, OKAY.

17:09.767 --> 17:10.733
WHERE ARE YOU?

17:10.767 --> 17:12.367
WHERE ARE--OH, HERE WE GO.

17:12.400 --> 17:15.167
AND--
- ALL VIDEOS DELETED.

17:16.667 --> 17:18.400
I DID NOT JUST DO THAT.

17:18.433 --> 17:20.067
- OKAY, WE'RE DONE.

17:20.067 --> 17:22.067
UNLESS YOU CAN PROVIDE
ANY CREDIBLE EVIDENCE,

17:22.100 --> 17:24.500
I'M READY TO RULE
IN FAVOR OF MR. CONRAD.

17:24.533 --> 17:28.500
- WE CAN'T LET THIS
PESKY JERK TAKE THE BAKERY.

17:28.533 --> 17:30.467
- PESKY.
THAT'S IT!

17:30.500 --> 17:32.300
DAD, FLY WITH ME.

17:37.600 --> 17:39.467
HI, CONRAD.

17:39.500 --> 17:41.600
NOBODY LIKES LIARZZZ.

17:43.267 --> 17:47.100
- THE FLY THAT'S GONNA LAY EGGS
IN YOUR EARS.

17:47.133 --> 17:48.700
- MR. CONRAD,
IS THERE A PROBLEM?

17:48.733 --> 17:50.067
- MM-MM.
MM-MM.

17:50.067 --> 17:51.100
- TELL HER, CONRAD.

17:51.133 --> 17:53.100
TELL HER THE TRUTH.

17:53.133 --> 17:54.667
OR FACE THE MUSIC.

17:56.800 --> 17:58.067
GET AWAY!
STOP IT!

18:01.567 --> 18:02.767
LOOK AT THAT!

18:02.800 --> 18:04.600
IT'S A MIRACLE!

18:04.633 --> 18:07.333
I'M HEALED!

18:10.200 --> 18:12.067
OKAY, NOW I'M REALLY HURT.

18:12.100 --> 18:13.600
I'M SUING THIS COURT.

18:13.633 --> 18:14.767
- GOOD LUCK WITH THAT.

18:14.800 --> 18:16.233
CASE DISMISSED.

18:16.267 --> 18:19.200
- OH, YES.
- BLESS YOU, LADY JUSTICE.

18:19.233 --> 18:21.500
YOU MAY BE BLIND,
BUT YOU SEE TRUTH.

18:21.533 --> 18:24.167
TO QUOTE MY WORLD-FAMOUS
DANDRUFF COMMERCIAL,

18:24.200 --> 18:26.767
"FREEDOM IS JUST A-- "
- GET HER OUT OF HERE!

18:26.800 --> 18:28.767
- ON IT.

18:33.133 --> 18:34.267
- LOOK WHO I FOUND.

18:34.300 --> 18:35.467
OKAY, JACKET ME.

18:35.500 --> 18:38.067
- FRANK, GLAD YOU'RE BACK.

18:38.067 --> 18:39.667
LET'S BEGIN.

18:39.700 --> 18:42.667
INITIATION INTO OUR RANKS
IS A SOLEMN AFFAIR.

18:42.700 --> 18:46.100
LOUIE PRESTON, STEP FORWARD.

18:52.400 --> 18:55.100
all: BOO CREW RULES!

18:55.133 --> 18:57.467
- HERE'S YOUR JACKET.

18:57.500 --> 19:00.700
- MY NAME IS ON
THE BOO CREW JACKET.

19:00.733 --> 19:05.400
KEEP IT TOGETHER, MAN.

19:05.433 --> 19:07.467
- FRANK, STEP FORWARD.

19:07.500 --> 19:09.433
- LISTEN, GUYS,
BEFORE YOU BEGIN,

19:09.467 --> 19:10.433
I HAVE SOMETHING TO TELL--

19:11.667 --> 19:15.833
all: BOO CREW RULES!

19:17.867 --> 19:19.400
- UH-OH.

19:19.433 --> 19:21.133
- THAT GHOST JACKET WENT RIGHT
THROUGH YOU.

19:21.167 --> 19:23.333
YOU'RE A...NOT GHOST!

19:23.367 --> 19:24.800
- YEAH.

19:24.833 --> 19:27.400
IS THERE SOMETHING ABOUT THAT
IN THE BYLAWS?

19:27.433 --> 19:29.600
'CAUSE--

19:29.633 --> 19:31.800
- LOUIE!

19:31.833 --> 19:34.633
YOU BROUGHT A HUMAN
INTO THIS CLUB?

19:34.667 --> 19:37.733
- I, UH--THE THING IS--

19:37.767 --> 19:40.833
- WE'RE GONNA NEED
YOUR JACKET BACK.

19:40.867 --> 19:43.733
- WAIT.
LOUIE DIDN'T KNOW.

19:43.767 --> 19:45.567
I TRICKED HIM INTO THINKING
I WAS A GHOST

19:45.600 --> 19:47.300
JUST LIKE I TRICKED YOU GUYS.

19:47.333 --> 19:49.400
THIS IS ALL MY FAULT,
NOT HIS.

19:49.433 --> 19:52.600
- IT'S TRUE.
I TRUST TOO MUCH.

19:52.633 --> 19:55.100
- OKAY.

19:55.133 --> 19:57.500
LOUIE STAYS.

19:57.533 --> 19:59.567
BUT, FRANK,
YOU BETTER GET OUT OF HERE!

19:59.600 --> 20:00.833
GO ON!
GET OUT OF HERE!

20:00.867 --> 20:02.133
YOU'RE NOT WORTHY!

20:02.167 --> 20:04.333
- HEY!
EASY, BILLY.

20:04.367 --> 20:07.267
A MINUTE AGO,
YOU THOUGHT FRANK WAS AWESOME.

20:07.300 --> 20:08.800
JUST BECAUSE
HE'S A LITTLE DIFFERENT--

20:08.833 --> 20:11.467
HE'S HUMAN.

20:11.500 --> 20:13.133
- SO HE'S NOT PERFECT.

20:13.167 --> 20:15.800
WHO HERE IS?

20:15.833 --> 20:19.100
REGGIE, YOU'RE AFRAID
OF THE DARK.

20:19.133 --> 20:22.367
AND STINKY PETE,
YOU SMELL...

20:22.400 --> 20:24.200
REALLY, REALLY BAD.

20:26.333 --> 20:27.567
AND BILLY...

20:27.600 --> 20:30.667
- UH, YOU'RE ALL GOOD.

20:30.700 --> 20:34.600
- PRESTON, THE MOST IMPORTANT
PART ABOUT BEING IN BOO CREW

20:34.633 --> 20:36.233
IS STANDING BY YOUR FRIENDS.

20:36.267 --> 20:38.667
- THAT'S WHAT I'M DOING.
FRANK'S MY BUD.

20:45.233 --> 20:49.267
WELL, I GUESS THERE'S
A FIRST TIME FOR EVERYTHING.

20:49.300 --> 20:50.367
FRANK, YOU'RE BACK IN.

20:52.200 --> 20:55.233
YES!
THIS IS SO AWESOME!

20:56.400 --> 20:59.067
- HE'S A GIRL!

20:59.100 --> 21:01.733
all: EWW!

21:01.767 --> 21:06.200
- UM, LET'S NOT FORGET LOUIE'S
WISE WORDS ABOUT ACCEPTANCE.

21:07.400 --> 21:10.667
- UH, MMM,
I AM DUMBFOUNDED

21:10.700 --> 21:13.367
AND HORRIFIED BY THIS
SHOCKING REVELATION.

21:13.400 --> 21:16.200
AS TO YOU, MADAME,
I SAY GOOD DAY.

21:16.233 --> 21:18.600
- LOUIE--
- I SAY GOOD DAY!

21:18.633 --> 21:22.300
- FINE.
I'LL GO.

21:22.333 --> 21:24.733
BOO!

21:24.767 --> 21:26.500
PSSH!
TOO EASY.

21:26.533 --> 21:29.067
- SHE SCARED ME.

21:33.067 --> 21:34.933
"I PRETENDED TO EAT MY BROCCOLI,

21:34.967 --> 21:39.200
BUT FED IT TO THE DOGS!"

21:39.233 --> 21:40.800
- "ONCE, I FOUND A QUARTER
ON THE GROUND

21:40.833 --> 21:42.400
"AND I DIDN'T LOOK
FOR THE OWNER.
