NARRATOR:
<i>Previously on</i> Hill Street Blues...

00:04.254 --> 00:08.675
-(screams)
-Last time I was down was 1977.

00:08.758 --> 00:10.635
It's 1983.

00:10.719 --> 00:13.638
I thought you and I
might try living together.

00:13.722 --> 00:15.306
I don't think so, Howard.

00:15.390 --> 00:16.933
Simone's a loan shark down in Midtown.

00:17.017 --> 00:19.102
Simone's an embarrassment
to this entire city.

00:19.185 --> 00:22.564
He's bankrolling a lot of other action,
dope, death.

00:22.647 --> 00:24.566
They just found piece 12
of Buddy Jannette.

00:24.649 --> 00:26.276
They want you to call Rollie Simone, Mo.

00:26.359 --> 00:27.485
Want you to sell him your paper.

00:27.569 --> 00:30.447
Add a loan for 28 grand.
Make the paper out to me.

00:30.530 --> 00:32.282
-What's your name?
-Bill.

00:32.365 --> 00:33.783
Nice name, Bill.

00:33.867 --> 00:35.285
What's the matter, Captain?

00:35.368 --> 00:37.412
It's your father. He passed away.

00:37.495 --> 00:39.539
The murder in the shelter, Franklin.

00:39.622 --> 00:42.751
I don't know anything about the murder.
I'm a very old man.

00:42.834 --> 00:45.378
Get away! Get away from me!

00:45.754 --> 00:46.921
You owe me.

00:49.174 --> 00:51.926
NARRATOR:
<i>And now, tonight on</i> Hill Street Blues...

00:52.635 --> 00:55.305
Oh, lordy mama,
I have died and gone to Heaven.

00:56.347 --> 00:59.225
-What does this look like to you?
-Stolen property.

00:59.309 --> 01:00.977
When we made the funeral arrangements,

01:01.061 --> 01:03.354
your company promised me a flame
that would never go out.

01:03.438 --> 01:04.272
Hmm.

01:04.355 --> 01:08.693
I wouldn't want to be responsible
for making someone as lovely as yourself

01:08.777 --> 01:11.029
feel anything other than wonderful.

01:11.112 --> 01:13.740
No way you're gonna make that nut
without doing something illegal.

01:13.823 --> 01:17.077
Which, if you're gonna do something wrong,
don't make it a nickel shot.

01:17.160 --> 01:21.664
Colette, I would very much like
to take you to dinner this evening.

01:23.625 --> 01:27.087
Kill him! Go on, kill him!
You've got your guns! Kill him!

01:29.214 --> 01:31.216
(indistinct chattering)

01:31.299 --> 01:34.886
Item 12, this regards paychecks,

01:35.595 --> 01:38.598
which, I'm afraid, none of us
will be cashing today, people.

01:38.681 --> 01:39.849
(officers jeering)

01:39.933 --> 01:40.892
ESTERHAUS: What can I tell you?

01:40.975 --> 01:45.021
Councilman Langella's filibuster
against the city budget compromise

01:45.105 --> 01:47.232
is now in its 63rd hour,

01:48.066 --> 01:51.319
with neither voluntary withdrawal
nor heart attack considered imminent.

01:51.402 --> 01:53.113
What about assassination?

01:53.196 --> 01:54.405
ALL: Yeah!

01:54.489 --> 01:56.658
ESTERHAUS:
It is being voted on as we speak.

01:56.741 --> 01:59.285
Mayor D'Angelo,
you'll be pleased to learn,

01:59.369 --> 02:02.330
applauds our valorous devotion
to duty in this crisis.

02:02.413 --> 02:05.792
-Yeah, eat this, Mario.
-(laughter)

02:05.875 --> 02:09.712
Item 13,
on only a slightly less gory note.

02:09.796 --> 02:13.758
Package 14 containing Mr. Jannette's
left forearm and hand

02:14.259 --> 02:17.137
was discovered in a phone booth
on Plymouth last evening.

02:17.220 --> 02:18.596
Yeah, trying to make a call.

02:18.680 --> 02:21.224
ESTERHAUS: For those of you keeping score,
Detective Benedetto,

02:21.307 --> 02:24.769
in the tradition of the great
Italian masters of the past,

02:24.853 --> 02:26.729
has contributed the following:

02:26.813 --> 02:29.607
-(officer coughs)
-Richard, give me a hand with this.

02:32.902 --> 02:36.072
-The, uh...
-(laughter)

02:36.156 --> 02:39.409
The, uh, shaded areas
mean it's still out there.

02:39.492 --> 02:40.702
(laughter)

02:40.785 --> 02:42.453
People, while I sternly remind you

02:42.537 --> 02:44.998
of the laws of this country
against gaming,

02:45.081 --> 02:49.252
Detective Benedetto has asked me
to pass along the following data

02:49.335 --> 02:52.463
which, he assures me,
is for news information only.

02:52.547 --> 02:54.090
Single-action play

02:54.174 --> 02:57.844
on particular organs and extremities
is still available.

02:57.927 --> 02:59.179
(chuckling)

02:59.262 --> 03:02.432
ESTERHAUS: On the over-and-under 18,
it's a dead number.

03:03.725 --> 03:07.270
A 5:1 is being offered on total packages
recovered by June 1st.

03:07.353 --> 03:10.106
Sal, Sal, gimme $20 on the heart.

03:10.190 --> 03:13.193
-ESTERHAUS: Springtime, love it.
-(chuckles)

03:13.401 --> 03:14.944
Moving right along.

03:15.987 --> 03:18.907
Item 14, the population
of county psychiatric

03:18.990 --> 03:22.160
was reduced by about 37 yesterday morning

03:23.369 --> 03:26.831
when our multiple-personality guy
of a couple days ago,

03:26.915 --> 03:28.708
Reggie, also known as "T.J.,"

03:29.083 --> 03:32.587
also known as "et cetera,
et cetera," escaped.

03:32.670 --> 03:36.674
Ergo, all radio motor-patrol units,

03:37.217 --> 03:38.760
to be on the lookout in the vicinity

03:38.843 --> 03:41.971
of men's shelter
on 133rd Street flophouse.

03:43.139 --> 03:44.682
All right, that's it. Let's roll.

03:45.516 --> 03:47.352
And hey, hey, hey, hey!

03:48.186 --> 03:50.605
Let's be careful out there.

03:50.688 --> 03:54.150
(indistinct chattering)

03:56.653 --> 03:58.321
I know what I'm talking about, okay?

03:58.404 --> 04:00.990
All right, the pancreas is paying 20:1.

04:01.074 --> 04:04.035
-Liver's still out there, both the feet.
-I don't want that.

04:04.118 --> 04:06.412
I've got $5 here says
it's gonna be the waist.

04:06.496 --> 04:08.998
The waist?
Where'd you learn biology, in a cave?

04:09.082 --> 04:11.417
Sal, I got $10 on the heart.

04:11.501 --> 04:13.294
Ooh, I love it! The romantic.

04:13.378 --> 04:16.673
-Absolutely.
-Joe, Joe... I got a tip, okay?

04:16.756 --> 04:19.384
The next thing to show up
is gonna be the heart.

04:19.467 --> 04:21.636
-What are you, Madame Marie?
-Would you just trust me, okay?

04:21.719 --> 04:23.429
I ain't standing around here
for the climate.

04:23.513 --> 04:25.598
SAL:
I still got no takers on the pancreas?

04:26.099 --> 04:28.309
-Kneecaps, you got it.
-$5 on the heart.

04:28.393 --> 04:30.812
Ooh, another one.
What is this, Valentine's Day?

04:30.895 --> 04:32.730
(chuckling)

04:33.690 --> 04:34.691
The soul?

04:37.402 --> 04:39.153
Hey, Leo. (coughs)

04:39.237 --> 04:42.699
Rico. Where you been?
I was starting to worry.

04:42.782 --> 04:44.742
Uh, you know,
I slept over my sister's place.

04:44.826 --> 04:48.413
-Oh.
-It's okay. I'm making it.

04:48.496 --> 04:50.832
-Every hour gets easier, you know?
-Good.

04:50.915 --> 04:52.667
Hey, come with me.
I got something for you to do today.

04:52.750 --> 04:53.876
I'm gonna put you on a desk.

04:53.960 --> 04:57.630
Hey, all right!
You know, I always wanted a desk job.

04:57.714 --> 04:59.048
(chuckles)

05:05.847 --> 05:08.141
(radio chattering)

05:23.698 --> 05:26.534
Andy, go for the third stall.
The latch is broken.

05:27.160 --> 05:28.786
It came up in conversation.

05:28.870 --> 05:30.246
RENKO: Don't look in the mirror.
You're too ugly.

05:30.330 --> 05:31.748
You ain't even got a face.

05:32.165 --> 05:33.875
Don't look underneath there.

05:33.958 --> 05:36.544
Move a little bit to the right. Yeah.

05:38.546 --> 05:42.300
RENKO: All right, boys and girls,
let's see what's behind door number three.

05:42.383 --> 05:46.387
-BOBBY: Yeah!
-(laughter)

05:46.471 --> 05:47.847
(stutters) It's Lucy!

05:47.930 --> 05:51.100
-Ooh! (snickers)
-Ah, yeah!

05:51.642 --> 05:54.854
<i>-Very witty, you sick jerks!</i>
-BOBBY: Watch out!

05:55.188 --> 05:57.774
WOMAN (on radio):
<i>Dispatch. We have a 9-11.</i>

05:57.857 --> 05:59.609
<i>Armed robbery in progress.</i>

05:59.692 --> 06:03.738
<i>See Surplus Store,</i>
<i>corner People's Drive and 124th Street.</i>

06:03.821 --> 06:05.114
(sirens wailing)

06:10.828 --> 06:14.499
(theme music playing)

07:30.324 --> 07:33.327
I sure hope we get a lot of calls today,
because nothing I'd rather be doing

07:33.411 --> 07:35.872
than running around this city
after dangerous criminals

07:35.955 --> 07:38.249
without the benefit of one Red Centavo.

07:38.332 --> 07:40.543
I know, Renko,
the way things are these days,

07:40.626 --> 07:42.462
I guess we're lucky it's only temporary.

07:42.545 --> 07:45.214
"Temporary" is not putting
pork and beans on my table.

07:45.298 --> 07:49.302
"Temporary" is not paying my utility bills
and putting gas in my hog.

07:49.385 --> 07:50.761
-"Temporary" is--
-Look at that!

07:51.179 --> 07:53.639
-BOBBY: Look at this!
-(siren wails)

07:53.723 --> 07:56.893
Two-two-oh-two north on Jefferson
in pursuit of foot suspect.

07:56.976 --> 07:58.269
Look at that man run!

07:58.352 --> 08:00.980
Let him turn, let him turn.
Go for him, go for him.

08:01.063 --> 08:03.107
(siren wailing continues)

08:10.448 --> 08:11.866
(tires screeching)

08:13.784 --> 08:15.536
BOBBY: Okay, buddy, hold it right there.

08:15.620 --> 08:18.789
Hey! I said hold it!
Wait a minute! Freeze!

08:22.084 --> 08:22.960
Say!

08:23.544 --> 08:24.504
Come back here!

08:25.004 --> 08:26.631
Say! Sucker!

08:33.930 --> 08:36.974
Oh, lordy mama,
I have died and gone to Heaven.

08:37.058 --> 08:40.686
-What do you think this is?
-Looks like stolen property.

08:40.770 --> 08:42.772
To me, it looks like unclaimed currency.

08:42.855 --> 08:45.983
Look at this. "Carmen 327, dollar boxed.

08:46.067 --> 08:49.529
Junior 365, 50 cents straight."

08:50.196 --> 08:52.990
Now, you know as well as I do that Carmen
and Junior ain't coming back for this.

08:53.074 --> 08:54.825
Renko, I know what you're thinking.
Just forget about it.

08:54.909 --> 08:58.079
No, no, no,
before you run to any rash conclusions,

08:58.162 --> 08:59.664
just think about this,

08:59.747 --> 09:02.250
if we don't turn this in,
ain't nobody ever gonna know.

09:02.959 --> 09:03.834
Get in the car.

09:05.002 --> 09:05.962
All right, all right, all right.

09:06.546 --> 09:08.798
I tell you what,
I'll put this in the backseat.

09:08.881 --> 09:11.217
We're in no hurry to turn it in,
and it ain't going nowhere.

09:11.300 --> 09:13.344
It'll give you and me a chance
to think this thing over.

09:15.012 --> 09:16.180
Thought about it. Now get in the car.

09:18.933 --> 09:23.062
Yeah, I know you took over my paper.
I don't care what Feldstein said.

09:23.145 --> 09:25.231
Just going through
some lean times, that's all.

09:26.315 --> 09:29.902
Twenty-eight grand? That's jive, man!

09:29.986 --> 09:31.779
I just gave him four last week!

09:32.738 --> 09:34.615
I think you better let me see that paper.

09:35.324 --> 09:37.201
Yeah. I know where it is.

09:37.743 --> 09:39.620
Four-thirty? I'll be there.

09:41.122 --> 09:44.709
-Man's on the hook.
-All right! (chuckles)

09:50.673 --> 09:54.302
You see what I'm talking about, Howard?
I tried to show some initiative.

09:54.635 --> 09:56.971
And look at the low priority
my project gets.

09:57.471 --> 09:58.514
How's that, sport?

09:58.889 --> 10:02.393
This cop-tip guy
from the radio station got sick,

10:02.727 --> 10:04.770
and who do they give me for an assistant?

10:04.854 --> 10:06.063
A common junkie.

10:06.439 --> 10:07.273
Two days ago,

10:07.356 --> 10:09.275
he thought there were turtles
coming out of his chest.

10:09.358 --> 10:14.363
Oh, well, Ray, one might argue
that a deejay and a junkie

10:14.447 --> 10:17.533
are not worlds apart
on the evolutionary ladder.

10:17.742 --> 10:20.244
Besides, the scientists
have been quite successful

10:20.328 --> 10:23.289
in training your apes,
your orangutans, even your gibbons

10:23.372 --> 10:25.916
to perform all sorts of perfunctory tasks.

10:26.000 --> 10:28.294
This is not a perfunctory task, Howard.

10:28.377 --> 10:29.587
This is my project.

10:29.670 --> 10:32.256
Well, just the same,
this boy might surprise you.

10:32.798 --> 10:35.926
(stutters) Excuse me, Lieutenant,
a woman just called in with a robbery.

10:36.010 --> 10:40.139
She said, uh, the two men
got approximately $800 in cash

10:40.222 --> 10:41.641
from her husband's liquor store.

10:41.724 --> 10:42.642
Ah, one of the men was black.

10:42.725 --> 10:46.020
He was about 6'1" and had a red shirt
and black pants.

10:46.103 --> 10:47.897
And the other one was a Caucasian.

10:47.980 --> 10:51.525
He was about 5'7",
slim, dark hair and clothes.

10:52.151 --> 10:53.444
Oh, and both men were armed.

10:53.527 --> 10:55.613
Good work. What's the address?

10:57.073 --> 10:58.240
Oh...

10:58.324 --> 11:00.576
The address. (sighs)

11:01.160 --> 11:02.995
Fay, it's a lunch, not a showdown.

11:04.205 --> 11:06.832
(stutters)
And I still think it's a good idea.

11:06.916 --> 11:09.126
Sure, you can talk things over,
clear the air.

11:09.877 --> 11:10.711
(laughs)

11:10.795 --> 11:13.047
Joyce isn't trying to take your son
away from you, Fay.

11:13.130 --> 11:15.216
She's just concerned
about Frank Jr.'s welfare.

11:17.009 --> 11:18.886
(stutters) Nobody says you're not.

11:19.970 --> 11:23.641
Look, I really have to go.
You're gonna be fine, Fay. I promise.

11:23.724 --> 11:24.725
Yeah.

11:26.477 --> 11:29.021
Let a broad find out she can get away
with bustin' your chops,

11:29.105 --> 11:30.690
and it's good night, nurse.

11:32.108 --> 11:32.942
You talk to Simone?

11:33.025 --> 11:35.611
(sighs) He got the paper
from Feldstein night before last.

11:35.695 --> 11:37.822
Saw the big markers on me for 28 grand.

11:37.905 --> 11:40.116
Wants to have lunch today,
talk about a payment schedule.

11:40.199 --> 11:42.660
Good. I don't have to warn you
about this guy, Neal.

11:42.743 --> 11:44.704
Yeah, I know, Captain. He's bad.

11:44.787 --> 11:47.331
Just don't want to see you end up
in 18 different packages.

11:47.415 --> 11:49.500
Only 14 so far, Captain.

11:51.001 --> 11:53.629
-You sure your cover's airtight?
-SAL: No problem. It's taken care of.

11:53.713 --> 11:57.591
We loaded the computer to make it look
like Neal's finances are in the doghouse.

11:57.675 --> 11:59.593
-Didn't have to tell many lies about that.
-(chuckles)

11:59.969 --> 12:02.179
What about Feldstein?
Somebody sitting on him?

12:02.263 --> 12:04.932
Mo told me he's hopping
the next plane to Miami.

12:05.015 --> 12:07.268
Believe me, that little runt's
the least of our problems.

12:07.601 --> 12:10.312
No, no, a heart. Yeah.

12:11.105 --> 12:13.733
No, a chicken's heart's too small.
You got anything bigger?

12:14.650 --> 12:17.528
I don't want a rump roast. I want a heart.

12:18.446 --> 12:20.990
I'm in veterinary school.
It's a class project, okay?

12:23.367 --> 12:25.161
Calf's heart? How big is that?

12:27.621 --> 12:29.790
Okay, wrap it up.
I'll be down this afternoon.

12:31.208 --> 12:32.376
Hey, what's doing, babe?

12:35.004 --> 12:36.046
Who wants to know?

12:36.589 --> 12:38.257
Aw, come on, J.D.

12:38.340 --> 12:40.885
Turn off the icebox routine.
It's just an assignment.

12:41.218 --> 12:43.929
Hey, from where I sit,
it doesn't look like you mind it too much.

12:44.555 --> 12:47.558
Look, man, I know Benedetto rubs
a lot of people the wrong way.

12:47.641 --> 12:49.769
-(scoffs)
-I used to feel the same way myself.

12:49.852 --> 12:51.145
But I gotta tell you something, babe,

12:51.228 --> 12:53.689
if it weren't for that guy two days ago,
I wouldn't be sitting here right now.

12:53.773 --> 12:55.399
Hey, what is this, <i>Brian's Song?</i>

12:55.483 --> 12:57.485
Okay, you brought a tear to my heart.

12:58.194 --> 12:59.820
The guy is a snail, Neal.

12:59.904 --> 13:02.573
He leaves a trail of slime
everywhere he goes.

13:02.656 --> 13:04.700
Well, if it isn't Ray Milland.

13:04.784 --> 13:06.952
What are you,
up there between suspensions?

13:07.203 --> 13:08.746
That's real cute, Sal.

13:08.829 --> 13:11.373
How 'bout you call me
when you get your oil changed?

13:13.375 --> 13:15.461
Oh, no, you're dead right, Neal,
the guy's a dreamboat.

13:26.931 --> 13:28.682
(telephone rings)

13:32.019 --> 13:35.105
Yeah, uh, cop-tips.
Uh, this is, uh, Rico speaking.

13:35.481 --> 13:38.234
(raspy voice) I, uh,
I found something real strange

13:38.317 --> 13:40.694
-in my front yard this morning.
-Yeah?

13:41.070 --> 13:42.488
Yeah, you know,
I've been hearing on the news

13:42.571 --> 13:45.241
about those pieces of that guy
you been finding.

13:45.324 --> 13:47.785
-I think this might be one.
-No kidding?

13:47.868 --> 13:51.664
Uh... Uh...
(stutters) Just hang on a second.

13:51.997 --> 13:54.708
Hey, I think I got another piece
of Buddy Jannette!

13:55.709 --> 13:57.586
(normal voice)
Hey, did you get the address?

13:57.670 --> 14:00.005
Oh, yeah, that's right. Uh, thanks.

14:00.923 --> 14:02.925
Sir, could I have your address?

14:04.260 --> 14:08.347
(raspy voice) Yeah, 117 North Hurdle.

14:08.806 --> 14:12.393
One-one-seven North Hurdle.

14:13.519 --> 14:15.354
All right. I got it.

14:15.646 --> 14:17.731
Uh, we're gonna send
somebody over right away.

14:22.778 --> 14:25.698
-Oh, hey, I'll take that one, kid.
-Hey, thanks, J.D.

14:25.781 --> 14:26.907
Don't mention it.

14:34.373 --> 14:36.959
You're gettin' old real fast,
you know that?

14:44.967 --> 14:47.303
Okay, ladies,
let's see what kind of sense of humor

14:47.386 --> 14:48.637
the boys have, huh?

14:48.721 --> 14:50.556
Okay, rotor-baby, do your stuff.

14:52.725 --> 14:54.810
(toilet flushes)

14:54.894 --> 14:56.562
<i>I'm sorry, but you're too late.</i>

14:57.021 --> 14:58.981
<i>You could have had</i>
<i>the thrill of your life.</i>

14:59.648 --> 15:01.483
-Ha-ha-ha...
-(rapid beeping)

15:01.942 --> 15:03.986
-OFFICER: What's that?
-LUCY: Who knows?

15:04.069 --> 15:06.322
There's so many gadgets on this thing.
I don't know.

15:06.405 --> 15:07.990
(beeping continues)

15:08.073 --> 15:10.326
-(explosion)
-(screams)

15:15.706 --> 15:17.958
(man coughing)

15:21.587 --> 15:23.297
Everyone in the building
is accounted for, sir.

15:23.380 --> 15:25.674
-Evidently the room was empty.
-Anybody hurt?

15:25.758 --> 15:28.260
A couple guys caught a little something--
nothing serious.

15:28.344 --> 15:30.095
Howard, you think we
ought to evacuate the building?

15:30.179 --> 15:32.473
Negative, Frank.
We've completed a perimeter check

15:32.556 --> 15:34.642
of the entire building, the rooftop,
and the parking lot.

15:34.725 --> 15:36.894
There is no evidence
of terrorist activity.

15:36.977 --> 15:38.854
All right, Henry, use anybody who's free.

15:38.938 --> 15:40.773
Get a list of everybody
issued a visitors pass

15:40.856 --> 15:43.025
in the past 72 hours,
let's run a check on them.

15:43.233 --> 15:45.986
I want forensics up here powdering,
and I want the bomb squad in here

15:46.070 --> 15:48.364
-with dogs to check for any other devices.
-Gotcha.

15:48.447 --> 15:50.658
Oh, check the Heights and Midtown.

15:50.741 --> 15:53.327
There's no reason to assume
that this is just an isolated incident.

15:53.410 --> 15:54.244
Right.

15:54.328 --> 15:56.705
Howard, let's get all the civilians
down in the parking lot

15:56.789 --> 15:58.374
till we get a clearance
from the bomb squad, okay?

15:58.457 --> 16:00.751
-Just to be sure.
-JOE: Leo, easy, would ya?

16:01.543 --> 16:02.419
You okay?

16:02.503 --> 16:05.422
I'm fine, Captain. I just got hit
with a couple of splinters.

16:06.382 --> 16:08.634
It's all right.
Can we all go back to work now?

16:10.344 --> 16:11.762
-Joe--
-Hey, I'm fine.

16:14.390 --> 16:16.225
Could I ask you
what that beeping sound was

16:16.308 --> 16:17.893
before the whole explosion thing?

16:17.977 --> 16:19.228
Explosive sensor.

16:19.311 --> 16:21.522
TK's most recently developed subsystem.

16:23.983 --> 16:26.527
Well... I have to apologize

16:26.610 --> 16:28.737
for almost getting
the whole thing blown up.

16:29.655 --> 16:32.825
Nonsense.
This model is designed to withstand...

16:33.575 --> 16:35.160
a much larger explosion.

16:36.620 --> 16:39.540
-No harm done.
-(chuckles)

16:40.457 --> 16:41.417
Anyway, I...

16:42.251 --> 16:44.837
I feel bad and wanted to tell you.

16:46.088 --> 16:47.339
I'm very sorry to hear it.

16:48.632 --> 16:53.929
I wouldn't want to be responsible
for making someone as lovely as yourself

16:54.013 --> 16:57.057
feel anything other than wonderful.

17:04.481 --> 17:05.649
(clears throat)

17:07.067 --> 17:08.152
Yeah, Ray, what?

17:08.235 --> 17:10.904
Frank, I want you to hear this.
Just came in.

17:10.988 --> 17:12.781
T.J. (over the phone): <i>It's me, T.J.</i>

17:12.865 --> 17:16.201
<i>Just thought I'd call you and see</i>
<i>how you liked my surprise package.</i>

17:16.285 --> 17:17.661
(laughs)

17:18.537 --> 17:22.166
<i>Don't worry if I missed you this time,</i>
<i>'cause I've got lots more.</i>

17:22.791 --> 17:24.418
<i>And don't think you can stop me.</i>

17:24.501 --> 17:27.046
<i>I can get in and out anytime I want to.</i>

17:29.840 --> 17:32.426
<i>The vision of your brains</i>
<i>splattered on the ceiling</i>

17:32.509 --> 17:34.178
<i>fills me with ecstasy.</i>

17:36.638 --> 17:38.432
<i>You get the name straight, okay?</i>

17:39.224 --> 17:42.144
<i>It's me, T.J. Me, T.J.</i>

17:43.645 --> 17:45.439
Chief, that guy's got a problem.

17:45.856 --> 17:48.358
The man who escaped
county psychiatric yesterday?

17:48.650 --> 17:50.360
Sounds the same. No luck getting a trace?

17:50.444 --> 17:51.945
We're not set up for it, Frank.

17:52.237 --> 17:55.074
Wait. He'll call back. You can bet on it.

18:00.329 --> 18:01.789
That'll be $3.44.

18:03.999 --> 18:05.793
What are you gonna do with it, LaRue?

18:06.376 --> 18:08.921
I mean, after you
finish snookering Benedetto.

18:09.004 --> 18:11.131
What do you mean
what am I gonna do with it?

18:11.215 --> 18:12.758
The best thing is to boil it.

18:13.300 --> 18:15.761
Then you grind it into a pâté.
You stuff blintzes with it.

18:15.844 --> 18:18.263
I'm telling you,
you never tasted anything so good.

18:18.680 --> 18:21.100
What, I look like some kind
of an urban cannibal here?

18:21.183 --> 18:23.727
That's Buddy Jannette's heart,
a human being.

18:24.103 --> 18:25.020
Thanks, Mack.

18:34.404 --> 18:36.907
-Mr. Simone?
-Neal?

18:40.494 --> 18:42.579
Sit down. You hungry?

18:42.663 --> 18:43.831
Um, no, thanks.

18:46.291 --> 18:47.292
You sure?

18:47.376 --> 18:48.961
Positive. Thanks anyway.

18:49.044 --> 18:50.879
What is it, Neal? You seem nervous to me.

18:52.047 --> 18:54.091
-Am I right?
-Little bit.

18:57.261 --> 18:58.262
Well, forget about being nervous.

18:58.345 --> 19:00.055
We're gonna work everything out,
all right?

19:00.639 --> 19:01.557
Okay.

19:03.767 --> 19:05.978
Neal, I got to tell you,
I went through your paper here,

19:06.061 --> 19:06.979
I ran your credit.

19:08.480 --> 19:10.440
I don't know how Mo
could let things get this far.

19:10.524 --> 19:11.567
Mr. Simone, the last payment I--

19:11.650 --> 19:15.195
Neal, let's do both of us a favor
and you keep your mouth shut.

19:15.946 --> 19:18.407
'Cause I gotta tell you,
I heard every lie you're gonna tell me.

19:18.991 --> 19:22.035
All right? Now, I'm gonna do the talking.

19:24.413 --> 19:27.583
Now, I say I don't know how Mo
let things get this far.

19:27.666 --> 19:29.626
In terms, you got 28 grand in debts.

19:29.710 --> 19:31.545
-Mr. Simone, I only borrowed--
-Shut up, Neal.

19:33.964 --> 19:37.759
This includes vig,
which makes your nut $700 a week.

19:37.843 --> 19:39.595
This isn't open to discussion, all right?

19:40.846 --> 19:42.389
Now, I got something else
to tell you, Neal.

19:42.472 --> 19:45.142
Seven yards a week, every week--

19:45.225 --> 19:47.811
no way you're gonna make that nut
without something illegal,

19:47.895 --> 19:49.938
which, if you're gonna do
something wrong...

19:51.356 --> 19:53.233
Don't make it a nickel shot.

19:54.109 --> 19:54.943
Do you follow?

19:58.864 --> 20:01.200
Now, I'm gonna tell you about a situation,

20:01.825 --> 20:03.577
and I want you to tell me

20:04.036 --> 20:05.662
could you do anything good with it.

20:06.830 --> 20:07.706
All right?

20:10.042 --> 20:11.084
I'm listening.

20:13.170 --> 20:14.004
All right.

20:14.463 --> 20:15.881
It's a suitcase, we'll say.

20:16.465 --> 20:19.718
Uh, some property
was involved in an arrest. You follow?

20:21.845 --> 20:23.555
Speak to me when I speak to you, Neal.

20:26.725 --> 20:28.518
-Some property.
-Some property...

20:29.478 --> 20:33.440
took a fall
and is in the police property room.

20:35.317 --> 20:37.402
-My precinct?
-Midtown.

20:38.946 --> 20:41.782
Now, uh, suppose it belonged to a...
cousin of mine,

20:41.865 --> 20:43.325
whatever the situation is,

20:43.408 --> 20:45.702
and this individual
wanted the suitcase back.

20:46.119 --> 20:49.456
Now, this is the situation where I feel
you could be of help, Neal.

20:50.207 --> 20:51.375
(sighs)

20:51.458 --> 20:52.709
(laughs) No.

20:53.418 --> 20:55.295
No, I don't think so, Mr. Simone.

20:55.379 --> 20:56.713
-You don't think so?
-Mm-mm.

20:57.214 --> 20:58.131
Why is that?

20:59.466 --> 21:01.677
It's tough to get into another
precinct's property room.

21:01.760 --> 21:03.011
It's tough?

21:03.595 --> 21:04.972
I hope it's tough.

21:06.223 --> 21:08.934
Otherwise, why would I wipe out
a $28,000 loan?

21:09.643 --> 21:11.853
And if a person showed some initiative,

21:12.271 --> 21:14.523
he could walk away with another fin
in his pocket,

21:14.940 --> 21:17.609
which I'd also understand
if there were added expenses

21:17.693 --> 21:19.695
with whoever you had to fix to get in.

21:23.198 --> 21:24.658
I don't know, Mr. Simone.

21:24.908 --> 21:25.951
Listen to me, Neal.

21:27.035 --> 21:27.869
You don't know?

21:30.831 --> 21:31.957
Do you know...

21:33.583 --> 21:34.710
the name Buddy Jannette?

21:38.380 --> 21:39.298
Yeah.

21:40.757 --> 21:43.176
This was a terrible thing
which happened to this guy.

21:43.969 --> 21:45.137
You know something, Neal?

21:46.054 --> 21:48.473
He owed less than $28,000.

21:48.557 --> 21:51.018
(breathing heavily)

21:51.101 --> 21:52.102
You follow me?

21:54.187 --> 21:55.272
Well, let me think about it.

21:56.773 --> 21:57.899
Think about it.

21:59.067 --> 22:01.778
Use some imagination,
'cause I want to hear from you today.

22:05.991 --> 22:07.326
What's gonna happen to all that money?

22:07.409 --> 22:09.494
We turn it in, nobody claims it,

22:09.578 --> 22:11.163
it's just gonna sit down
at county property

22:11.246 --> 22:13.165
and mold until its statutes run out.

22:13.248 --> 22:15.375
And the city will get it,
like it's supposed to.

22:15.459 --> 22:18.086
So, A;
we got a city the size of this one,

22:18.170 --> 22:20.172
and B; we got me and you.

22:20.255 --> 22:24.676
Now, who do you think
is more deserving of $2,942.38?

22:24.760 --> 22:27.679
We're not taking the money, Renko.
It's just wrong.

22:28.638 --> 22:29.639
Wrong?

22:31.350 --> 22:33.226
I'll tell you what's wrong!

22:33.852 --> 22:35.187
This is wrong!

22:35.812 --> 22:38.398
Now, I don't know why it is
that I have to be fair to this city

22:38.482 --> 22:40.942
when this city is under no obligation
to be fair to me!

22:41.026 --> 22:42.110
It's not the same thing.

22:42.194 --> 22:43.653
And just why isn't it?

22:44.946 --> 22:47.783
-I don't know. Can we just drop this?
-Yeah, okay, okay.

22:50.035 --> 22:51.870
But first, I want you to hear my side.

22:52.913 --> 22:55.082
We take the money, we split it,

22:55.165 --> 22:57.876
that's $1,400, just down the middle.

22:57.959 --> 22:59.169
Okay, now, we got Bobby Hill.

22:59.252 --> 23:01.088
He's got two hands.

23:01.171 --> 23:03.298
The right hand,
he's down there at the landlord's.

23:03.382 --> 23:05.634
He's down there at the power company,
he's down there at the phone company,

23:05.717 --> 23:07.511
he's paying off all his necessities now.

23:07.761 --> 23:11.181
And meantime, with his left hand,
he's down at Globeman's.

23:11.890 --> 23:13.850
He's buying himself a new suit,

23:13.934 --> 23:16.895
he's buying himself a pearl necklace
for his girlfriend,

23:16.978 --> 23:18.313
he's buying a couple cashmere sweaters,

23:18.397 --> 23:21.733
maybe a new pair of those New Balance
running shoes, $100 a pop.

23:22.025 --> 23:24.152
-Those are out now?
-Yes.

23:28.490 --> 23:29.825
I don't know, Renko.

23:29.908 --> 23:33.078
Of course, I haven't even
gone into my own financial state,

23:33.161 --> 23:34.287
such that it is,

23:35.372 --> 23:37.958
'cause I didn't want to put
any unfair pressure on you.

23:43.130 --> 23:46.174
Renko, why don't you just keep the money?
Keep it for yourself.

23:46.258 --> 23:50.095
Supposing I did this.
Supposing I did keep all the money.

23:50.178 --> 23:52.764
And then,
in an entirely unrelated transaction,

23:52.848 --> 23:54.349
supposedly I made you a gift,

23:54.433 --> 23:56.726
which amounted to, say, half the proceeds.

23:56.810 --> 23:59.938
Would that soothe
your already-overheated conscience?

24:01.064 --> 24:03.066
If we're gonna do it,
it's on the both of us.

24:03.150 --> 24:05.026
-We're in it together.
-Take that as a yes.

24:05.110 --> 24:07.112
But I'm telling you, Renko,
it's just a one-time-only proposition.

24:07.195 --> 24:08.572
Absolutely, Roberto.

24:08.655 --> 24:11.199
It's as if our auntie died
and went to heaven.

24:11.283 --> 24:13.743
WOMAN (on radio): <i>211 at Jocko's.</i>
<i>Genesee and Chippewa.</i>

24:13.827 --> 24:17.372
Three most overused words
in the English lexicon, 211 at Jocko's.

24:18.415 --> 24:22.210
-Will you lighten up?
-I'm light. I'm up.

24:22.294 --> 24:25.547
-2202 responding.
<i>-WOMAN</i> (on radio): <i>Roger, 2202.</i>

24:25.630 --> 24:27.174
Look, I was at the stoplight!

24:27.257 --> 24:29.801
She reaches in the window,
grabs my privates with one hand

24:29.885 --> 24:31.178
and my wallet with the other!

24:31.678 --> 24:34.389
-And-- What are you laughing at?
-Nothing.

24:34.681 --> 24:35.932
I chased her here!

24:36.016 --> 24:38.059
That guy says I'm the one causing trouble,

24:38.310 --> 24:39.978
grabs me, and starts asking questions!

24:40.061 --> 24:41.938
In the meantime,
she's running out the back!

24:42.898 --> 24:44.316
What do you know, Jocko?

24:44.399 --> 24:47.235
Guy comes in here screaming and yelling.
How do I know what's going on?

24:47.319 --> 24:49.237
Come on,
you wouldn't even let me use the phone!

24:49.321 --> 24:50.614
It's out of order, man.

24:50.697 --> 24:52.073
Sir, did you get a good look at the woman?

24:52.991 --> 24:54.075
Not really.

24:54.159 --> 24:56.912
-How much money did you lose?
-$26.

24:58.079 --> 24:59.831
Sir, if you want to come in,
make a complaint,

24:59.915 --> 25:01.333
we'll take you through the paperwork.

25:01.958 --> 25:03.293
You're saying it's a waste of time?

25:03.793 --> 25:05.086
I can't be the judge of that.

25:05.462 --> 25:07.214
Depends on what else you got to do, sir.

25:07.506 --> 25:09.007
Well, I'll tell you,

25:09.090 --> 25:11.343
that man might as well
have been an accessory!

25:11.426 --> 25:12.844
This place should be closed down!

25:12.928 --> 25:16.598
Sir, this place has been closed down
more often than a Detroit auto plant.

25:16.681 --> 25:19.351
Let me have a 7 and 7, there, Jocko.

25:19.601 --> 25:22.062
(laughs)

25:23.355 --> 25:24.272
What's so funny?

25:25.190 --> 25:26.775
That your fellas' short out there?

25:28.026 --> 25:30.070
That is our police vehicle outside,
yes, sir.

25:30.153 --> 25:30.987
Why?

25:31.071 --> 25:34.074
Skoal, brother. (laughs)

25:38.912 --> 25:41.790
Oh, mother,
what have they done to your child?

25:45.377 --> 25:46.378
Hey!

25:48.255 --> 25:50.382
Son of a-- Come back here!

26:00.308 --> 26:01.601
First, they'll find our car,

26:01.685 --> 26:02.727
and then they'll find
the satchel in the trunk,

26:02.811 --> 26:03.937
and then I'm going to jail!

26:04.020 --> 26:05.522
You're not going to j--

26:05.605 --> 26:08.149
You are suffering
from acute delusionary paranoia,

26:08.233 --> 26:10.902
and I am suffering
from heart palpitations.

26:10.986 --> 26:12.779
I get this dream that I'm in--
in the joint

26:12.862 --> 26:15.574
in the same cell with the people
that I sent away.

26:15.657 --> 26:17.909
I'm gonna call up a unit,
have them come down here and pick us up.

26:17.993 --> 26:19.411
No! Don't do that, Renko.

26:20.078 --> 26:22.455
(stutters) I just have to think, man.
I'm sorry. I just gotta think.

26:22.539 --> 26:25.166
Look, we're just gonna tell them
that we got the call to go to Jocko's

26:25.250 --> 26:26.334
before we turned in the dough.

26:26.418 --> 26:28.253
Oh, that's just good, Renko!

26:29.588 --> 26:32.966
And because we made no arrests
and started no paperwork

26:33.049 --> 26:36.720
and just happened to stash the cash
underneath the spare tire,

26:36.803 --> 26:38.096
they'll believe us.

26:38.179 --> 26:39.431
I swear, if we get out of this,

26:39.514 --> 26:42.434
I'll never do another wrong thing
for as long as I live.

26:43.518 --> 26:48.064
You didn't do anything wrong.
You never got the chance.

26:50.150 --> 26:51.443
Oh, my goodness.

26:52.485 --> 26:53.320
BOBBY: Is it?

26:53.820 --> 26:55.822
Thank you, Lord. Thank you, Lord.

26:55.905 --> 26:59.492
Oh, baby, baby, baby!

27:00.827 --> 27:02.203
Bobby, check to see if the...

27:04.164 --> 27:05.665
if our spare is all right.

27:08.335 --> 27:10.503
-Ha!
-One tire!

27:11.087 --> 27:13.965
Um, sir, would you happen to see who--

27:14.841 --> 27:18.094
-Downstairs.
-(train passing)

27:33.485 --> 27:35.070
(door closes)

27:48.833 --> 27:50.251
All right, hold it right there.

27:50.627 --> 27:51.711
What do you want?

27:55.799 --> 27:56.966
You know what?

27:57.050 --> 27:59.636
You picked the wrong car
to joy ride in here this time.

27:59.719 --> 28:01.721
-Renko, Renko, take it easy.
-Oh, you're tough.

28:01.805 --> 28:04.140
This delinquent
has caused me inconvenience,

28:04.224 --> 28:06.768
morbid thoughts,
and put my cardiac system at risk.

28:06.851 --> 28:08.895
-Do you live here?
-Yeah, I live here.

28:12.816 --> 28:13.733
Cozy.

28:16.695 --> 28:17.821
Right over there.

28:20.407 --> 28:23.118
Oh, can you see that? It's out.

28:23.201 --> 28:26.538
I'm not going to insult your intelligence,
Mr. Belker. (chuckles)

28:27.247 --> 28:28.081
You're right. It's out.

28:28.164 --> 28:30.333
Well, it shouldn't be out, Mr. Farnsworth.

28:30.792 --> 28:32.293
When we made the funeral arrangements,

28:32.377 --> 28:35.130
your company promised me a flame
that would never go out.

28:35.213 --> 28:38.717
-Mm, did we say that, exactly?
-Yes, you did.

28:39.050 --> 28:40.719
The eternal flame, you called it.

28:41.553 --> 28:43.346
You got a copy of your contract,
Mr. Belker?

28:43.430 --> 28:45.348
-You bet I do.
-Great.

28:45.765 --> 28:48.476
We'll get to the bottom of this.
(chuckles)

28:53.148 --> 28:55.650
Oh, yeah, that explains it.

28:55.734 --> 28:57.068
You got the eternal flame.

28:57.152 --> 28:59.696
I know that, the eternal flame.

28:59.779 --> 29:01.531
Well, it's like this, you see, Mr. Belker.

29:01.614 --> 29:03.241
We here at Mt. Sinai Gardens

29:03.324 --> 29:05.744
offer three different varieties of flames

29:05.827 --> 29:08.496
in our "family torch" series, see?

29:08.955 --> 29:13.334
You've got your eternal at $798,
like your father has here.

29:13.418 --> 29:16.838
You got your perpetual at $898 per,
and finally,

29:16.921 --> 29:19.674
your perpetual eternal at $1098,

29:19.758 --> 29:23.094
which features your 3/4-inch
all-weather wick,

29:23.178 --> 29:25.388
stainless-steel support housing,

29:25.472 --> 29:27.599
and copper delivery system.

29:27.682 --> 29:29.601
Belker, I'm getting
a serious migraine here.

29:29.684 --> 29:30.894
Just a minute!

29:31.978 --> 29:32.937
What are you saying to me?

29:33.021 --> 29:35.356
Are you saying
that the perpetual eternal flame's

29:35.440 --> 29:37.692
the only one guaranteed 24 hours a day?

29:37.776 --> 29:40.236
Seven days a week, 52 weeks a year,

29:40.820 --> 29:43.656
but let me tell you one thing
I learned about death, my friend.

29:45.658 --> 29:48.578
Death is a natural process.

29:49.829 --> 29:53.374
One way or another,
nature's gonna have its way with you.

29:53.458 --> 29:55.293
I mean, you take your coffins,
for example.

29:55.376 --> 30:01.174
You could plunk down four grand
on a zinc-lined Mt. Zion Deluxe,

30:01.549 --> 30:02.842
and you could seal it triple tight,

30:02.926 --> 30:06.137
and you're still going to get
residual seepage.

30:07.013 --> 30:07.931
Nature!

30:08.431 --> 30:10.934
What I'm telling you here
is you could buy eternal,

30:11.518 --> 30:15.355
you could buy perpetual,
you could buy perpetual eternal,

30:16.147 --> 30:18.358
but if you don't have a windbreak,

30:20.235 --> 30:22.487
you could buy perpetual eternal perpetual

30:22.570 --> 30:25.198
and your flame is still
gonna get blown out occasionally.

30:25.865 --> 30:26.950
Well, we can-- (stammers)

30:27.033 --> 30:28.660
You take your all-weather windbreak,

30:28.743 --> 30:31.162
your copper delivery system,
and your 3/4-inch wick,

30:31.246 --> 30:33.164
and you cram it, Farnsworth!

30:33.248 --> 30:35.208
Now he ain't springing for dime one.

30:35.291 --> 30:38.086
Now, I got a perfect view
of this cut-rate boneyard of yours

30:38.169 --> 30:41.172
from the 36th-street overpass
every day on my way to work.

30:41.840 --> 30:43.800
All right? I don't care
if it's 4:00 in the morning,

30:43.883 --> 30:45.426
there's a hurricane blowing out here,

30:45.510 --> 30:48.972
I catch the flame on my partner's
dad's grave out for one second,

30:49.055 --> 30:51.266
and you're gonna be perpetually,
eternally dead.

30:51.349 --> 30:55.436
Not perpetually, not eternally,
but perpetually, eternally dead!

30:55.520 --> 30:57.564
-Now, you got it?
-Uh-huh.

30:59.065 --> 31:00.275
Let's get out of here, man.

31:28.970 --> 31:31.222
We have done it, Frank, bow to stern.

31:31.764 --> 31:34.684
Gabriella here has come up
with a blank snoot.

31:35.560 --> 31:38.897
No unexpended pyrotechnical devices
on the premises.

31:39.188 --> 31:41.232
RAY: How accurate are those dogs?

31:41.316 --> 31:43.318
HOWARD: Well, they're accurate enough
to sniff out a box

31:43.401 --> 31:46.195
of .38 caliber shells
that Officer Smeljanich

31:46.279 --> 31:49.073
was storing against departmental
regulations in his locker.

31:49.449 --> 31:50.658
I have spoken to the man.

31:50.742 --> 31:52.452
(Gabriella barks)

31:52.535 --> 31:56.414
I am guessing that this is your standard
shop-class pipe bomb,

31:56.497 --> 31:59.292
fulminated mercury packed with plaster,

31:59.375 --> 32:01.669
and if our bomber had been up to snuff,

32:01.753 --> 32:04.797
he could have taken out
three stalls and a towel rack.

32:05.632 --> 32:08.092
Let's not give him a second chance,
okay, Howard?

32:11.220 --> 32:13.014
(telephone rings)

32:15.391 --> 32:16.643
Cop tips. Who's this?

32:20.313 --> 32:22.565
Hello? Is this a little kid speaking?

32:24.692 --> 32:26.110
Hold on. Wait a second.

32:27.195 --> 32:28.363
Hey, Lieutenant.

32:33.868 --> 32:35.453
Could you say what you said again, please?

32:35.536 --> 32:37.246
MAN (over the phone):
<i>I said he's a bad man.</i>

32:37.330 --> 32:38.831
<i>He needs to be put in jail.</i>

32:39.248 --> 32:41.501
<i>You can come put him in there now.</i>
<i>He's sleeping.</i>

32:41.793 --> 32:43.461
No, say what you said at first.

32:45.046 --> 32:46.965
<i>He made a bomb,</i>
<i>and I watched him make it.</i>

32:48.466 --> 32:50.593
The bomb for here,
went off in the station?

32:51.177 --> 32:53.513
<i>He wanted to hurt you. He hates you.</i>

32:54.222 --> 32:56.099
Get him to tell you where he is.

32:56.724 --> 32:59.727
Tell me where you are,
little kid, your address.

32:59.894 --> 33:03.606
<i>Hotel Grand, 524.</i>

33:04.190 --> 33:07.026
Five-two-four.

33:07.443 --> 33:08.486
Where is this guy?

33:09.362 --> 33:10.613
<i>He's upstairs.</i>

33:11.197 --> 33:13.616
<i>He's sleeping now. I'm scared.</i>

33:13.700 --> 33:14.951
Don't be scared.

33:15.034 --> 33:17.245
<i>You have to come and get him.</i>
<i>He should be dead.</i>

33:17.954 --> 33:18.997
<i>I want you to kill him.</i>

33:19.080 --> 33:21.207
We're gonna send someone
to see you right now.

33:21.290 --> 33:23.793
<i>I'm scared. I have to go.</i>

33:24.711 --> 33:26.879
It could be a prank, but I don't think so.

33:26.963 --> 33:29.882
-Me neither.
-(tires screeching)

33:36.347 --> 33:37.598
Cover the outside!

33:48.526 --> 33:50.278
Lieutenant,
what if there is a bomb in there?

33:50.361 --> 33:52.280
Luce, it's probably just some kid
playing with the phone.

33:52.363 --> 33:53.322
Quiet.

33:53.406 --> 33:55.950
MAN: Help! Help! Help! (hooting)

33:58.703 --> 34:00.121
This is Lieutenant Goldblume
from the police department.

34:00.204 --> 34:02.498
-Would you open up in there, please?
-MAN: Go away!

34:03.332 --> 34:06.085
I'm gonna have to have
this door open right now!

34:06.169 --> 34:09.714
MAN: Help! Help!

34:09.797 --> 34:10.965
-Kick it.
-What about the kid?

34:11.049 --> 34:12.258
There's no kid. Kick it.

34:15.511 --> 34:19.098
Kill him! Go on, kill him!
You've got your guns! Kill him!

34:19.515 --> 34:20.391
T.J...

34:21.100 --> 34:23.144
I want you to move back from the window.

34:23.227 --> 34:24.937
You don't understand! I'm Reggie!

34:25.021 --> 34:29.150
I've got ahold of T.J.,
and if you don't kill him, I will!

34:29.233 --> 34:30.735
I'll push him out!

34:32.320 --> 34:33.154
No! Don't!

34:33.905 --> 34:37.575
No, you let T.J. fool you
into thinking he was dead,

34:37.658 --> 34:39.827
and he wasn't! He wasn't!

34:40.369 --> 34:43.956
He came back! He came right back!

34:44.665 --> 34:48.211
Please, oh, God, he's got to die!

34:48.294 --> 34:52.006
Oh, God, he's gotta die!
I can't stand it anymore!

34:52.090 --> 34:53.883
I can't! I can't!

34:54.926 --> 34:57.678
Reggie? Reggie?

35:00.223 --> 35:01.891
There is no T.J.

35:03.476 --> 35:05.061
You're only gonna hurt yourself.

35:08.981 --> 35:09.941
Come on.

35:12.026 --> 35:13.027
Give me your hand.

35:14.487 --> 35:16.322
(shouts)

35:18.324 --> 35:20.618
(siren wailing)

35:20.701 --> 35:22.161
Is T.J. dead?

35:23.037 --> 35:25.623
Yeah. Take it easy. We got you.

35:26.249 --> 35:28.668
It's so quiet. They're all gone.

35:29.252 --> 35:31.587
I used to look forward to going to sleep.

35:33.089 --> 35:35.133
It's the only time I got away from them.

35:36.926 --> 35:39.762
-What's your name, son?
-Carl.

35:41.305 --> 35:42.431
Carl Brown.

35:43.599 --> 35:46.894
T.J. was my friend once, my best friend,

35:48.062 --> 35:49.272
but he took over.

35:50.815 --> 35:53.276
T.J.'s the one who escaped
from the hospital.

35:53.943 --> 35:56.154
T.J. put the bomb in the building.

35:59.574 --> 36:00.533
It's okay.

36:01.284 --> 36:02.326
Nobody got hurt.

36:03.619 --> 36:07.832
They all took over,
and they wouldn't let me come back.

36:08.332 --> 36:10.710
I got so tired of listening to them.

36:12.628 --> 36:14.505
I didn't think Reggie could do it.

36:16.716 --> 36:18.342
I'm so glad he did.

36:24.140 --> 36:26.058
It's so quiet.

36:50.583 --> 36:52.210
It's Neal Washington, Mr. Simone.

36:52.960 --> 36:55.588
I made some calls,
turns out you could probably get

36:55.671 --> 36:57.465
that item you were interested in, right?

36:58.257 --> 37:00.718
But it's gonna be a little more expensive
than you were--

37:01.385 --> 37:04.096
Fella I talked to said
he'd need 15 Gs on his end.

37:04.180 --> 37:07.350
He's from Midtown, right?
So is that doable for you?

37:07.934 --> 37:09.101
Solid.

37:10.061 --> 37:12.897
Well, we're ready to roll
whenever you-- Good.

37:13.689 --> 37:14.607
Okay.

37:16.692 --> 37:18.027
-(sighs)
-Action?

37:18.110 --> 37:20.488
-Action, Sal.
-All right.

37:21.280 --> 37:22.490
Lis-- Listen to me!

37:23.115 --> 37:26.327
If you don't start telling the truth,
you're gonna buy yourself a work stoppage.

37:26.661 --> 37:27.620
That's not a threat.

37:27.703 --> 37:29.580
That's a realistic evaluation
of the situation,

37:29.664 --> 37:31.666
something you people
don't seem capable of.

37:32.833 --> 37:35.461
-You reach Simone?
-Ready to go, Captain. Meet's on for 6:00.

37:35.544 --> 37:37.713
-Who's running backup?
-Jekalek and Sisinecki.

37:38.005 --> 37:39.966
Is Simone gonna make this pickup himself?

37:40.132 --> 37:42.468
-Said so.
-I think he's gotta send the beard.

37:43.219 --> 37:45.263
Is your conversation setting up
the meet with him on tape?

37:45.346 --> 37:46.347
Every word of it.

37:46.430 --> 37:49.141
-Then we still have him made.
-Unless we die talking.

37:49.225 --> 37:50.643
We're on our way to pick up
the goods, Captain.

37:50.726 --> 37:51.602
Hold it!

37:52.895 --> 37:54.814
What's this story
about your going in without a wire?

37:54.897 --> 37:56.399
I think I'm gonna pass on it, Captain.

37:56.482 --> 37:58.651
I don't think that's a good idea.
I want him hooked up.

37:58.734 --> 38:01.195
Simone's sure to pat me down.
A wire could give me away.

38:01.279 --> 38:02.905
And lack of one could get you dead.

38:02.989 --> 38:03.906
Simone's a butcher,

38:03.990 --> 38:06.242
and I don't send my men in
unprotected to butchers.

38:06.325 --> 38:08.035
Captain, there's gonna be backups.

38:08.119 --> 38:09.370
That's it, Neal.

38:10.454 --> 38:11.622
Coordinate through Phil.

38:12.873 --> 38:13.708
Good luck.

38:14.834 --> 38:15.835
Yeah, okay.

38:19.005 --> 38:20.256
(sighs)

38:21.215 --> 38:22.967
-Hey, Benedetto.
-Yeah.

38:25.052 --> 38:27.972
Okay, check it out, gentlemen.

38:28.639 --> 38:32.101
Now, I don't know too much about anatomy,
but that sure looks like a heart.

38:32.184 --> 38:35.313
-Lame, LaRue, no sale.
-Hey, hey, whoa, what are talking about?

38:35.396 --> 38:37.481
We don't dig bookies
that welch up here, huh?

38:37.565 --> 38:38.941
That's Buddy Jannette's ticker.

38:39.025 --> 38:40.776
Yeah? And where's his udder?

38:41.527 --> 38:42.361
What's he mean?

38:42.445 --> 38:44.905
I think the man believes
that's a cow's heart, J.D.

38:46.115 --> 38:46.991
Bull!

38:48.075 --> 38:48.909
Could be.

38:50.244 --> 38:51.245
(chuckles)

38:54.790 --> 38:56.292
Renko, go in there and--

38:56.375 --> 38:58.711
Don't tell me again. I'm going. I'm going.

39:06.302 --> 39:07.762
-Something, Andy?
-Yes, sir.

39:08.387 --> 39:10.097
Captain, I thought you might enjoy seeing

39:10.181 --> 39:12.224
what me and Bobby Hill
picked up on the street today,

39:12.308 --> 39:16.354
$2,942.38, an obvious numbers operation.

39:16.437 --> 39:18.606
We got the slips. We got the money.
We got everything.

39:18.689 --> 39:19.940
-Good work, Andy.
-Thank you, sir.

39:20.024 --> 39:23.069
Sir, you know, it occurs to me
there's a strong possibility

39:23.152 --> 39:25.154
that the contents of this bag
might provide

39:25.237 --> 39:27.615
a gold mine of information
to our vice officers.

39:27.698 --> 39:29.867
I'm sure it will.
I'll get it to them right away.

39:33.120 --> 39:36.916
Uh, Captain, Bobby Hill was exceptional
in the performance of his duty,

39:36.999 --> 39:40.461
driving that car, chasing down
that individual, transporting that money.

39:41.170 --> 39:43.255
I don't want you to think
just 'cause I come in here alone,

39:43.339 --> 39:44.924
I want to take credit for everything.

39:45.007 --> 39:46.300
I'll be sure to give him an attaboy.

39:46.384 --> 39:49.095
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.
You know he'll appreciate that.

39:54.767 --> 39:57.770
Sir, it is a shame
to waste all that money.

39:58.396 --> 40:01.649
It's just gonna sit there on some shelf
until the city comes to claim it.

40:01.857 --> 40:04.777
Not enough money there
to keep a municipal dump truck in tires.

40:05.611 --> 40:07.279
You mean too bad
we can't keep what we find.

40:07.363 --> 40:09.281
-Yes!
-Yeah.

40:10.074 --> 40:11.117
Exactly.

40:11.951 --> 40:14.620
Too bad. Thanks, Andy.

40:17.873 --> 40:21.419
Well... I guess that's about it, isn't it?

40:26.882 --> 40:30.678
-You hungry? Want a sandwich or some milk?
-Mm-mm.

40:31.595 --> 40:33.472
-What's your name?
-Speedboat.

40:33.556 --> 40:35.516
Not your street name. Your real name.

40:36.559 --> 40:37.810
Bobby.

40:37.893 --> 40:38.894
Bobby?

40:39.478 --> 40:41.272
Hey, you know, that's my real name, too.

40:41.355 --> 40:43.107
I like Speedboat.

40:45.776 --> 40:46.819
Okay.

40:48.070 --> 40:49.947
You live in that basement
all by yourself, Speedboat?

40:50.030 --> 40:50.865
Yeah.

40:50.948 --> 40:51.949
Where's your mom and dad?

40:52.032 --> 40:55.119
My mom's in jail.
I don't know nothing about no dad.

40:55.202 --> 40:57.413
Did someone put you in a foster home?

40:57.496 --> 40:59.540
Yeah, I hated it. I escaped.

40:59.623 --> 41:01.750
They tried to put me
in juvie hall after that.

41:01.834 --> 41:05.004
I got out of there too. I don't need
nobody to take care of me.

41:06.213 --> 41:07.465
(sighs)

41:09.800 --> 41:12.303
What are you gonna do
when you get older, Speedboat,

41:13.429 --> 41:15.764
when you get to be a real man?

41:15.848 --> 41:17.266
Where do you see yourself?

41:22.730 --> 41:24.690
I don't know. Nowhere, I guess.

41:26.859 --> 41:28.068
Well, I did it, good buddy.

41:28.486 --> 41:30.905
That money is now officially
in police custody.

41:31.280 --> 41:32.948
Tell me, don't you feel better about that?

41:33.032 --> 41:35.201
Well, I must admit
to a certain spring to my step.

41:35.618 --> 41:37.119
How's our little car enthusiast?

41:37.995 --> 41:42.166
Fine. We're just having a little talk
before the youth authority gets here.

41:42.625 --> 41:44.835
You tell them about his talent
for mobility?

41:44.919 --> 41:47.421
I swear, I cannot figure out
how those little munchkin-like legs

41:47.505 --> 41:49.924
got down to those pedals and saw to drive.

41:50.549 --> 41:52.009
I'll kill you for that, porkchop.

41:58.349 --> 41:59.683
I'll kill that porkchop.

41:59.767 --> 42:01.727
He's a tough man, Speedboat.

42:02.686 --> 42:05.022
It could always end up
the other way around, you know?

42:05.105 --> 42:08.359
So? There'd be one less nigger
in the world, that's all.

42:10.236 --> 42:14.156
ESTERHAUS: Bobby?
The youth control people are outside.

42:14.823 --> 42:18.494
Shall I escort this lad to the front desk?

42:18.577 --> 42:19.870
Sure.

42:20.371 --> 42:22.289
Sarge, can I take another second?

42:23.666 --> 42:24.917
Of course.

42:27.127 --> 42:28.212
Speedboat...

42:30.506 --> 42:32.800
This is for you.
This has got my number on it.

42:33.384 --> 42:35.761
They'll give you phone privileges
where you're going. I want you to use it.

42:35.844 --> 42:38.180
Call me up anytime, and we'll rap, okay?

42:39.014 --> 42:41.767
-About what?
-Anything, man.

42:57.283 --> 42:58.742
Sign these two, too.

42:58.826 --> 43:00.452
Hey, Iggy, what,
you think you're a train, huh?

43:00.536 --> 43:02.246
Two-too? (chuckles)

43:02.329 --> 43:03.247
That LaRue,

43:03.330 --> 43:06.000
he oughta be doing whoopee cushions
in a hemorrhoid clinic.

43:06.083 --> 43:09.086
I was pulling that cow-heart gag
when I was 12.

43:09.169 --> 43:11.672
Afraid that's about as good
as they get on the hill, Sal.

43:11.755 --> 43:14.174
-We're not up to Midtown yet, you know?
-(chuckles)

43:14.466 --> 43:19.263
And this one here, just in case
you guys got two 16-year-olds

43:19.346 --> 43:20.806
waiting in a car to go to Miami.

43:20.889 --> 43:23.058
Don't think I ain't thought about it, Ig.

43:24.018 --> 43:26.604
Weighs out at 20 pounds, 12 ounces.

43:28.606 --> 43:32.610
Now, here's your lab report,
and here's a sample, if you want one.

43:32.693 --> 43:35.362
Mmm, stuff is pedigree.

43:37.823 --> 43:40.075
(gasps) Ooh. I oughta get a filling.

43:40.909 --> 43:42.119
Now, you guys be careful.

43:43.454 --> 43:46.624
Yeah, it's Simone who'd better be careful.
Later, Ig.

43:50.628 --> 43:52.338
(soft music playing)

44:02.556 --> 44:04.600
You want same business as last time, Bill?

44:05.517 --> 44:09.563
Uh, no, Colette.
What you're doing is just fine.

44:10.898 --> 44:12.941
You have a strong back, Bill.

44:13.609 --> 44:18.238
In Vietnam, man with strong back
said to be strong in the mind,

44:18.489 --> 44:21.533
strong in the love, strong in everything.

44:22.868 --> 44:25.871
Was it bad for you, the war?

44:29.083 --> 44:30.084
Very bad.

44:31.460 --> 44:32.544
My father die.

44:33.837 --> 44:35.047
My brother die.

44:36.423 --> 44:39.385
I have to work in the streets
since I'm 12 years old.

44:40.928 --> 44:42.179
When the communists come,

44:42.971 --> 44:45.057
there's only one seat on airplane.

44:46.392 --> 44:49.937
My mother says, "Colette, you go."

44:53.649 --> 44:57.361
I live my life for all my family now.

44:59.238 --> 45:02.116
I work hard, save money,

45:03.033 --> 45:06.161
go to daytime school, learn English.

45:07.079 --> 45:08.330
I'm happy now.

45:10.416 --> 45:12.459
I give some happiness to you, too, Bill.

45:15.170 --> 45:18.841
-Actually, uh, it's Howard.
-Huh?

45:19.967 --> 45:22.261
My name is Howard.

45:22.886 --> 45:24.096
Howard.

45:25.723 --> 45:27.349
Nice name, Howard.

45:29.226 --> 45:33.897
Colette, I would very much like
to take you to dinner this evening.

45:35.232 --> 45:37.234
Of course, I'll-I'll pay for your time.

45:39.778 --> 45:40.863
I like that, Bill.

45:41.530 --> 45:43.782
You talk to big man up front first, okay?

45:44.908 --> 45:45.868
Of course.

45:48.579 --> 45:50.748
-Colette?
-Yes, Bill?

45:50.831 --> 45:52.124
(chuckles)

45:57.921 --> 46:01.759
-You are very beautiful.
-Thank you.

46:04.344 --> 46:07.806
(siren wailing)

46:21.695 --> 46:24.531
MAN 1: <i>Sal, we're gonna be eligible</i>
<i>for our pensions soon.</i>

46:24.615 --> 46:26.784
MAN 2: <i>What makes you think they'll</i>
<i>pay us that, either?</i>

46:27.785 --> 46:28.994
Very funny.

46:30.037 --> 46:32.247
<i>You sure Simone meant this year, Sal?</i>

46:33.457 --> 46:35.459
Hey, Burns and Allen, what time you got?

46:36.084 --> 46:38.879
-BURNS: <i>8:30.</i>
-ALLEN: <i>P.M.</i>

46:40.339 --> 46:42.800
All right, shut it down. Tell the others.

46:44.009 --> 46:45.761
BURNS: <i>Hey, we're in no rush.</i>

46:45.844 --> 46:48.055
ALLEN: <i>You don't want to give</i>
<i>them another half-hour?</i>

46:48.347 --> 46:50.516
Go on, take off. I'll get Washington.

46:52.309 --> 46:54.561
(engine turns over)

47:10.369 --> 47:12.246
Simone must have took a pass, kid.

47:12.329 --> 47:14.873
Oh, man,
he sure sounded ready on the horn.

47:14.957 --> 47:17.459
Yeah, they're like cats, huh.
They're like gypsies.

47:17.543 --> 47:21.088
They hit a crack in the sidewalk and it's,
"I ain't going nowhere today."

47:21.171 --> 47:22.089
Come on, get in.

47:23.882 --> 47:25.717
(engine turns over)

47:33.559 --> 47:35.060
Get your hands on the dashboard!

47:35.143 --> 47:37.020
Hey, what the hell is this, huh?

47:37.604 --> 47:41.024
You! Gimme the bag! Come on!

47:42.317 --> 47:44.069
Now the keys! Move!

47:45.279 --> 47:47.614
-(shouts) Now, Sal!
-Don't do it, man!

47:48.699 --> 47:50.993
-I'll kill you!
-(grunting)

47:51.910 --> 47:53.662
(screams)

47:53.745 --> 47:56.498
-Come on, let's get out of here!
-He shot me! I'm shot, Sal!

47:56.582 --> 47:59.793
(siren wailing)

48:00.335 --> 48:03.338
A lot of blood.
There's an awful lot of blood!

48:03.422 --> 48:05.340
-It's all right, Neal.
-I don't wanna die!

48:05.424 --> 48:08.468
Hey, you're not going anyplace, man.
Don't worry about it.

48:08.552 --> 48:11.221
Will you cut it out?!
You'll just put yourself into shock.

48:14.433 --> 48:17.811
Hey, Sal? Don't tell 'em I'm scared.

48:17.895 --> 48:19.104
Hey, if you were scared, Neal,

48:19.187 --> 48:21.064
you never would have gone
for the guy's gun.

48:21.148 --> 48:24.651
-Please don't tell 'em I'm scared.
-Okay, all right. Just try to relax, huh?

48:25.903 --> 48:27.279
(whimpering)

48:32.242 --> 48:35.245
(closing theme playing)
