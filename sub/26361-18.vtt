where you said she liked

10:16.006 --> 10:17.442
recording people on her phone.

10:17.486 --> 10:20.837
- Like I said, she called it
her mobile office.

10:21.621 --> 10:23.448
Tell you the truth,

10:23.492 --> 10:25.146
I think she got paranoid
when the FBI

10:25.189 --> 10:27.627
started raiding
the lawyer's offices.

10:27.670 --> 10:29.367
She wouldn't even upload
to the cloud.

10:29.411 --> 10:32.066
- What information's on it?
- I don't know.

10:32.109 --> 10:34.938
But she used to say there'd be
a lot of people crying

10:34.982 --> 10:37.027
if that phone
got in the wrong hands.

10:37.071 --> 10:38.638
[knocking]

10:38.681 --> 10:40.335
Hey, guys.

10:40.378 --> 10:42.032
- We'll be in touch.

10:42.076 --> 10:44.252
- Nikki's been saying her
whole life is on that phone.

10:44.295 --> 10:46.384
- A lot of other people's,
too, it sounds like.

10:46.428 --> 10:48.996
- No wonder she's dying
to get it back.

10:51.259 --> 10:54.131
- So you're just gonna hassle
my old clients

10:54.175 --> 10:55.959
instead of looking
at real suspects?

10:56.003 --> 10:57.874
- You know how this works.
We are following every lead,

10:57.918 --> 10:59.659
trying to figure out
what happened to you.

10:59.702 --> 11:01.704
- I know what happened to me.

11:01.748 --> 11:03.967
I was drugged and I was raped.

11:04.011 --> 11:06.578
Have you even checked
the video from the party?

11:06.622 --> 11:09.103
- Yes, we looked at the street
cams, the security cams.

11:09.146 --> 11:11.627
- If you were dosed there,
the cameras missed it.

11:11.671 --> 11:14.674
- Oh, well,
isn't that convenient?

11:15.675 --> 11:16.980
[scoffs]
So what?

11:17.024 --> 11:17.981
You guys think that I went out

11:18.025 --> 11:19.461
and had a one night stand

11:19.504 --> 11:20.941
and can't remember it now?

11:20.984 --> 11:22.812
I am not a blackout drunk.

11:22.856 --> 11:24.379
- No one thinks that.

11:24.422 --> 11:25.772
- We're just looking at a list
of individuals

11:25.815 --> 11:27.338
that may have motive.

11:27.382 --> 11:29.906
- No, see, I know
where you're going with this.

11:29.950 --> 11:31.995
You're looking to pin it
on one of my clients

11:32.039 --> 11:33.693
so that you don't
have to look at a guest list

11:33.736 --> 11:35.346
that is 50% police!

11:35.390 --> 11:36.783
- Counselor, you're way off
base here.

11:36.826 --> 11:37.871
- Am I?
- Yeah.

11:37.914 --> 11:39.524
- Doesn't it seem funny to you

11:39.568 --> 11:40.917
at all that whoever did this

11:40.961 --> 11:42.832
to me knew enough
to take my phone

11:42.876 --> 11:44.138
and turn off the tracking?

11:44.181 --> 11:46.009
- Everybody would know
to do that.

11:46.053 --> 11:47.750
- Well, who would go
to such extremes

11:47.794 --> 11:50.535
to gain access
to my key information?

11:50.579 --> 11:51.972
My texts and phone numbers

11:52.015 --> 11:54.191
and recorded statements
from clients.

11:54.235 --> 11:56.324
- Are you really suggesting
that somebody

11:56.367 --> 12:00.458
from our department drugged you
and then raped you

12:00.502 --> 12:02.983
just so that they could steal
your cell phone?

12:03.026 --> 12:06.116
- A lot of your brother
officers have vendettas

12:06.160 --> 12:09.859
against me because I have
called them out and sued them.

12:09.903 --> 12:11.252
- You're out on a limb here,
Counselor.

12:11.295 --> 12:14.516
- I have been personally
threatened by cops

12:14.559 --> 12:17.998
dozens of times and now
I have been assaulted

12:18.041 --> 12:19.956
after a police party,

12:20.000 --> 12:22.524
so why aren't you
questioning them?

12:24.047 --> 12:26.441
You should be
looking at your own.

12:27.485 --> 12:29.096
[scoffs]

12:39.846 --> 12:40.281
.

12:40.324 --> 12:42.500
- So does Nikki Staines
have a point?

12:42.544 --> 12:44.285
Should we be
looking at a cop for this?

12:44.328 --> 12:45.808
- I'm not buying it.

12:45.852 --> 12:48.028
- Well, if you're gonna say
that there is no way

12:48.071 --> 12:49.594
a police officer
could have done this,

12:49.638 --> 12:51.683
I'm gonna say you're wrong.
- And if this was

12:51.727 --> 12:53.381
some random assault
after the party,

12:53.424 --> 12:55.383
why did he take her phone
and not her wallet?

12:55.426 --> 12:58.212
- Okay, I admit it's hinky,
but it's not dispositive.

12:58.255 --> 12:59.517
- She is suing the department.

12:59.561 --> 13:01.432
This is the biggest case
of her career.

13:01.476 --> 13:03.695
- If he wanted a phone,
why did he rape her?

13:03.739 --> 13:06.611
- Well, she did say
that a lot of cops

13:06.655 --> 13:08.439
had personal vendettas
against her.

13:08.483 --> 13:11.225
But I say we stay focused
on the party.

13:11.268 --> 13:12.792
I mean, she doesn't remember
leaving,

13:12.835 --> 13:14.489
the security cams didn't
pick her up outside the event,

13:14.532 --> 13:16.404
and whoever drove her home

13:16.447 --> 13:18.493
avoided the street cams.

13:18.536 --> 13:20.277
- Which a cop
would know how to do.

13:20.321 --> 13:22.540
- That's opportunity.
What about motive?

13:23.846 --> 13:27.937
Look, was she suing
any of these cops individually?

13:27.981 --> 13:30.157
- She could be planning to.

13:31.332 --> 13:32.812
- The only way
we're gonna rule this out

13:32.855 --> 13:36.816
is to subpoena
every single cop at that party.

13:38.556 --> 13:42.473
So which one of you wants to go
to talk to Dodds with me?

13:42.517 --> 13:44.040
- Let me get this straight.

13:44.084 --> 13:45.825
You want me to allow
a fishing expedition

13:45.868 --> 13:49.132
on the personnel records
of 50 police officers?

13:49.176 --> 13:51.134
- They were all at this party.

13:51.178 --> 13:52.875
We need to eliminate them
as suspects.

13:52.919 --> 13:54.964
- And create a record
that will be a treasure trove

13:55.008 --> 13:57.924
for a defense lawyer
already suing our department?

13:57.967 --> 13:59.099
No.

13:59.142 --> 14:00.230
- We don't want it to look like

14:00.274 --> 14:01.753
we're circling the wagons.

14:01.797 --> 14:03.799
- I got news.
We are circling the wagons.

14:03.843 --> 14:05.018
Staines is the enemy.

14:05.061 --> 14:07.585
- No, not this time.

14:07.629 --> 14:09.849
Staines is the victim here,
Dodds.

14:09.892 --> 14:11.154
- I have to ask.

14:11.198 --> 14:13.156
Are you sure
you even have a case?

14:13.200 --> 14:14.679
I know!
I know, I get it.

14:14.723 --> 14:16.420
She says she doesn't
remember consenting.

14:16.464 --> 14:18.988
- I believe that she was

14:19.032 --> 14:20.598
drugged, assaulted,

14:20.642 --> 14:23.210
and whoever did this
knew how to avoid detection.

14:23.253 --> 14:25.255
They were careful
not to be seen.

14:25.299 --> 14:26.648
They avoided the cameras.

14:26.691 --> 14:28.345
- Yeah, or Staines
is steering us

14:28.389 --> 14:30.260
in that direction.
- What possible reason

14:30.304 --> 14:32.175
would she have to do that?

14:32.219 --> 14:34.612
- I don't know.
But before I sign off

14:34.656 --> 14:36.397
on subpoenas for half
the department,

14:36.440 --> 14:38.225
just vet her motives.

14:38.268 --> 14:40.270
Talk to Rob Miller.

14:44.492 --> 14:46.015
- I was horrified to hear

14:46.059 --> 14:47.190
what happened
to Nikki Staines.

14:47.234 --> 14:48.278
How's she doing?

14:48.322 --> 14:50.367
- As well as can be expected.

14:50.411 --> 14:52.456
So you spoke with her
at the party.

14:52.500 --> 14:54.458
Do you recall her leaving
with anyone?

14:54.502 --> 14:56.373
- No, but I'd had a lot
to drink myself.

14:56.417 --> 14:58.593
I barely remember
how I got home.

14:58.636 --> 14:59.724
- Nobody said being a lawyer

14:59.768 --> 15:01.465
makes you a perfect witness,
huh?

15:01.509 --> 15:04.599
- Actually, lawyers generally
make lousy witnesses.

15:06.340 --> 15:08.211
So the chief said
you're a little stymied

15:08.255 --> 15:09.386
in your investigation?

15:09.430 --> 15:11.040
- [scoffs]

15:11.954 --> 15:14.130
Could we speak privately?
- Of course.

15:14.174 --> 15:15.784
- Maria, thank you.

15:18.787 --> 15:21.181
- So Dodds said that you might
be able to provide

15:21.224 --> 15:24.619
some insight
on what happened to Nikki.

15:25.359 --> 15:27.752
- Well, I've learned
a thing or two

15:27.796 --> 15:30.712
from being her opposing counsel
on this surveillance case.

15:30.755 --> 15:32.583
- Like what?

15:32.627 --> 15:34.063
- The power of technology.

15:34.107 --> 15:37.110
It's a list of suspects
from the sex crimes databases

15:37.153 --> 15:38.459
who happened to be in the area

15:38.502 --> 15:40.809
where Nikki says
she was assaulted.

15:40.852 --> 15:42.506
- Wow.

15:42.550 --> 15:43.943
Where did you get this?

15:43.986 --> 15:46.728
- A private company
that aggregates location data

15:46.771 --> 15:50.253
from cell phones
and owes me a favor or two.

15:50.297 --> 15:51.951
The irony is,
Nikki would be appalled

15:51.994 --> 15:54.388
by the civil liberties issues
if the police did this,

15:54.431 --> 15:56.607
but I'm not the police.

15:56.651 --> 15:58.827
- Well, thank you.

15:58.870 --> 16:00.785
- You're welcome.

16:00.829 --> 16:02.439
There's also something else
we should discuss,

16:02.483 --> 16:04.746
and I am sorry to say
that it involves

16:04.789 --> 16:07.357
the credibility
of your victim.

16:13.798 --> 16:15.452
- This is a file on Nikki.

16:15.496 --> 16:16.671
- I think you should know what

16:16.714 --> 16:18.629
you're getting yourself into,

16:18.673 --> 16:20.457
before you put
any more eggs in this basket.

16:20.501 --> 16:22.068
And what am I getting into?

16:22.111 --> 16:24.200
- Did you know that Nikki's
been cited for contempt

16:24.244 --> 16:25.854
four times,
and that at least one judge

16:25.897 --> 16:27.203
has threatened
to have her sanctioned

16:27.247 --> 16:28.422
for suborning perjury

16:28.465 --> 16:30.554
and submitting
false statements?

16:34.036 --> 16:36.604
- Are you saying
that Nikki is a liar?

16:36.647 --> 16:38.998
- Absolutely not.
I like Nikki personally.

16:39.041 --> 16:42.044
But I want you
to be able to go into this

16:42.088 --> 16:43.698
with your eyes open.

16:46.135 --> 16:48.659
- Well...

16:48.703 --> 16:51.053
We're still gonna pursue
the case.

16:51.097 --> 16:52.663
- As you should.

16:52.707 --> 16:55.884
I wanted you
to have a chance to get ahead

16:55.927 --> 16:57.190
of a potential problem

16:57.233 --> 17:01.933
with someone making
accusations about the NYPD.

17:06.416 --> 17:07.722
Should I not have shared this?

17:07.765 --> 17:11.378
- No, of course
it's better to know, I--

17:13.771 --> 17:15.077
[sighs]

17:17.775 --> 17:19.386
- I feel like
I've offended you.

17:19.429 --> 17:23.085
- No, not at all, we're--
we're all professionals here.

17:23.129 --> 17:24.695
- [chuckles]
I was afraid

17:24.739 --> 17:26.828
you'd say that as well.
- Why?

17:26.871 --> 17:28.743
- Because I wanted
to ask you out

17:28.786 --> 17:31.920
for a drink tomorrow night
before the Governor's dinner.

17:31.963 --> 17:34.096
- [laughs]

17:34.140 --> 17:36.098
Didn't see that one coming.
- You didn't?

17:36.142 --> 17:37.360
- No.
- Come on.

17:37.404 --> 17:40.276
- No.
- Give me a chance

17:40.320 --> 17:42.104
to show you
I'm one of the good guys.

17:42.148 --> 17:45.412
6:00, Trattoria Italienne?

17:46.108 --> 17:47.892
- I, uh--

17:47.936 --> 17:51.505
I would need to arrange
childcare so, um...

17:52.549 --> 17:54.029
I'll let you know.

17:54.073 --> 17:55.639
- I look forward to it.

17:56.510 --> 17:58.164
- [laughs]

17:59.600 --> 18:01.819
- You got it, Liv.
We'll check it out.

18:02.777 --> 18:04.518
- She said how it went
with the chief?

18:04.561 --> 18:05.910
- As well as could be
expected.

18:05.954 --> 18:08.043
No subpoenas for cops
at the party.

18:08.087 --> 18:11.916
And he also told her
to ask Rob Miller for help.

18:11.960 --> 18:14.745
- What?
How is he gonna help?

18:14.789 --> 18:17.574
- Apparently
he gave Liv a file

18:17.618 --> 18:20.316
on Nicky Staines' background.

18:20.360 --> 18:21.622
Either of you think it's odd

18:21.665 --> 18:23.624
that we're getting leads
from Miller?

18:23.667 --> 18:25.060
- Miller is a player.

18:25.104 --> 18:26.931
He knows where all
the bodies are buried.

18:26.975 --> 18:29.238
- He's also opposing counsel
to Nikki

18:29.282 --> 18:31.240
in the civil rights case
against our department,

18:31.284 --> 18:33.634
which gives him a vested
interest in knocking her out.

18:33.677 --> 18:35.592
- You know why sharks don't
attack lawyers, right?

18:35.636 --> 18:36.941
Professional courtesy.

18:36.985 --> 18:39.944
- [laughs]
- Why do opposition research

18:39.988 --> 18:41.946
against the other side's
attorney?

18:41.990 --> 18:45.254
If you want to win the case,
you go after the plaintiffs.

18:45.298 --> 18:47.778
- You don't like Miller, huh?

18:47.822 --> 18:49.258
- You said he was charming
at that party.

18:49.302 --> 18:51.217
- He tried to be.

18:51.260 --> 18:53.480
He pretended that he recognized

18:53.523 --> 18:56.047
my Loganville accent.

18:56.091 --> 18:57.745
- So?

18:58.789 --> 19:02.097
- So there's no such thing
as a Loganville accent.

19:08.538 --> 19:09.496
- Hey, can I take your order?

19:09.539 --> 19:10.758
- Yeah, actually, David,

19:10.801 --> 19:12.020
I'd like to have a word
with you.

19:12.063 --> 19:14.501
- Uh,
we're pretty busy right now.

19:15.806 --> 19:17.634
You mind telling me
what this is about?

19:17.678 --> 19:19.158
I happen to be an attorney.

19:19.201 --> 19:21.160
- I know you're an attorney.

19:21.203 --> 19:22.639
This is about Rob Miller.

19:22.683 --> 19:25.164
You were a junior associate
at his firm.

19:26.034 --> 19:29.124
- Megan, could you take over
for a second?

19:32.345 --> 19:33.781
- Listen.

19:33.824 --> 19:36.653
I do not need to have a problem

Hey, did Miller
put you up to this?

without my partner.

interviewing

was never on the record.

It's part of a larger file
on Ms. Staines.
