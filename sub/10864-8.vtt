00:36.400 --> 00:37.840
OK. I'm here.

00:37.840 --> 00:39.240
Let's go.

00:39.240 --> 00:40.680
So who's up tonight?

00:40.680 --> 00:42.120
I am.

00:42.120 --> 00:43.760
Just give me
a minute.

00:46.080 --> 00:48.240
Yo! Let's get with
the program!

00:48.240 --> 00:50.240
Hold on.
I'm almost done.

00:50.240 --> 00:53.680
You kinda said that
5 minutes ago.

00:54.600 --> 00:55.560
Done.

01:01.080 --> 01:02.960
Sorry. My grandmother's
birthday's coming up,

01:02.960 --> 01:06.440
and I've been putting off
writing that card for weeks.

01:06.440 --> 01:07.600
How come?

01:07.600 --> 01:09.120
I've been really busy.

01:09.120 --> 01:12.080
I do volunteer work at the
library and at united hospital.

01:12.080 --> 01:14.080
And, um...I just
kinda forgot.

01:14.080 --> 01:15.480
I hear ya.

01:15.480 --> 01:18.080
Why do today what you can
put off till tomorrow?

01:18.080 --> 01:21.080
No. It's never good to
leave something undone,

01:21.080 --> 01:23.960
'cause you never know if you're
gonna get a chance to finish it.

01:23.960 --> 01:25.960
Nothing's so important
that it can't wait.

01:25.960 --> 01:27.440
That's not true.

01:27.440 --> 01:29.960
What if there's something
really important

01:29.960 --> 01:31.960
that you had to do,

01:31.960 --> 01:35.000
but something big
kept you from doing it?

01:35.000 --> 01:36.240
Like what?

01:36.240 --> 01:38.400
Like maybe... death?

01:39.840 --> 01:42.480
Always say what
you have to say

01:42.480 --> 01:45.480
and do what you have to do.

01:45.480 --> 01:47.960
Because if you don't...

01:47.960 --> 01:50.040
You might not get
a second chance.

01:52.040 --> 01:53.960
Submitted for the approval

01:53.960 --> 01:56.280
of the Midnight Society,

01:56.280 --> 01:58.600
I call this story...

02:06.480 --> 02:09.400
<i> Jessie Dickson
was the kind of girl</i>

02:09.400 --> 02:11.400
<i> who liked to keep busy.</i>

02:11.400 --> 02:14.400
<i> She did a lot of
volunteer work in town</i>

02:14.400 --> 02:16.400
<i> and took all sorts of odd jobs.</i>

02:16.400 --> 02:19.400
<i> Taking care of Mrs.
Simpson's yard was one of them.</i>

02:19.400 --> 02:21.400
And this is your
heart line.

02:21.400 --> 02:22.920
<i> Sara Simpson
lived alone,</i>

02:22.920 --> 02:24.400
<i> and most people in town</i>

02:24.400 --> 02:27.400
<i> thought she was
a little bit... eccentric.</i>

02:27.400 --> 02:28.920
There are many obstacles

02:28.920 --> 02:31.880
keeping you from finding
your true soul mate.

02:41.480 --> 02:42.560
Shoot.

02:54.240 --> 02:56.440
<i> Jessie lived with
her grandpa Samuel.</i>

02:56.440 --> 02:58.440
<i> They were good buddies...</i>

02:58.440 --> 03:01.360
<i> So long as Jessie didn't
track mud into the house</i>

03:01.360 --> 03:04.360
<i> or leave the windows
open in the rain.</i>

03:04.360 --> 03:06.400
<i> Grandpa Samuel had been
a little sick lately,</i>

03:06.400 --> 03:08.360
<i> so they moved his bed
downstairs.</i>

03:08.360 --> 03:11.880
<i> That way he wouldn't have to
climb the stairs so much.</i>

03:11.880 --> 03:13.360
Aw, Gramps.

03:13.360 --> 03:15.680
Come on, now.
Renting my old room out

03:15.680 --> 03:18.680
is the easiest way
to bring in some money

03:18.680 --> 03:20.680
till I get back
to work.

03:20.680 --> 03:24.440
I don't want some stranger
living in our house.

03:24.440 --> 03:25.880
It doesn't
thrill me, neither.

03:25.880 --> 03:27.280
But Grandpa--

03:27.280 --> 03:30.520
No "but grandpas." Some
things you just gotta do.

03:37.440 --> 03:38.880
Come on.

03:38.880 --> 03:41.880
We're gonna miss the
first part of the movie,

03:41.880 --> 03:43.360
and I hate missing
the--

03:43.360 --> 03:45.360
Hey... you're renting
a room?

03:45.360 --> 03:47.360
I don't wanna
talk about it.

03:47.360 --> 03:48.080
Right.

03:51.960 --> 03:54.880
It was so cool when the
zombie came to life.

03:54.880 --> 03:56.360
Yeah, but the best

03:56.360 --> 03:59.360
was when the corpse
started eating the people.

03:59.360 --> 04:01.320
Man, that's
entertainment.

04:01.320 --> 04:02.440
Whoa!

04:04.400 --> 04:05.800
What?

04:05.800 --> 04:09.000
I gotta pick up my lawn
money from Mrs. Simpson.

04:13.200 --> 04:15.320
That place
gives me the creeps.

04:15.320 --> 04:17.760
So wait for me here.

04:20.279 --> 04:21.839
<i> Alone?</i>

04:21.839 --> 04:23.400
Forget it!

04:44.880 --> 04:46.600
What's she doing?

04:46.600 --> 04:48.880
I don't know.

04:49.880 --> 04:51.320
She's a wack.

04:51.320 --> 04:52.880
Let's get out
of here.

04:52.880 --> 04:55.720
[Clock tolls]

04:55.720 --> 04:57.520
Come on!

05:00.120 --> 05:01.200
Alex.

05:32.680 --> 05:35.200
Aah!
Aah!

05:47.840 --> 05:49.280
Grandpa!

05:49.280 --> 05:52.160
What? You two look like
you've seen a ghost!

05:52.160 --> 05:53.160
Bingo!

05:53.160 --> 05:54.560
We did!

05:54.560 --> 05:56.000
I saw it!

05:56.000 --> 05:57.000
Wait. Saw what?

05:57.000 --> 05:58.000
A ghost!

05:58.000 --> 05:59.280
OK. What's the joke?

05:59.280 --> 06:00.800
It's no joke.
It came through

06:00.800 --> 06:03.360
Mrs. Simpson's ceiling and
walked through the wall!

06:03.360 --> 06:04.480
Right through.

06:04.480 --> 06:06.440
Mrs. Simpson.
Well, that explains it.

06:06.440 --> 06:10.560
And what was the good lady doing
when all this was going on?

06:10.560 --> 06:12.240
Sleeping.
Some kind of trance.

06:12.240 --> 06:14.880
What were you two doing
there at this time of night?

06:14.880 --> 06:16.280
Coming home
from the movies.

06:16.280 --> 06:18.280
<i>Double feature.
The Dead Walk</i>

06:18.280 --> 06:20.280
<i>and the Dead
Walk Again.</i>

06:20.280 --> 06:21.720
No wonder.

06:21.720 --> 06:24.720
You two have let your
imaginations run away with you.

06:24.720 --> 06:26.560
No! This was
real!

06:26.560 --> 06:30.240
I think you two have been
spending too much time over there.

06:30.240 --> 06:32.240
Sara Simpson's crazy
as a June bug,

06:32.240 --> 06:33.960
what with her
palm reading,

06:33.960 --> 06:36.360
tea leaves
and mumbo jumbo.

06:36.360 --> 06:37.720
But this wasn't--

06:37.720 --> 06:40.720
I don't know what you
girls are trying to pull,

06:40.720 --> 06:42.120
but it won't work.

06:42.120 --> 06:44.080
Not with me, anyway.

06:44.080 --> 06:45.840
[Chuckles]

07:07.240 --> 07:10.280
I'm here about
the room for rent.

07:10.280 --> 07:12.400
Wonderful!

07:19.760 --> 07:21.680
Have a seat.

07:21.680 --> 07:24.680
What did you say
your name was?

07:24.680 --> 07:26.680
Uh, Browning.

07:26.680 --> 07:28.880
John Browning.

07:28.880 --> 07:30.240
Have we met before?

07:30.240 --> 07:31.760
You look familiar.

07:31.760 --> 07:32.520
No.

07:33.280 --> 07:35.040
I don't think so.

07:35.040 --> 07:36.400
Cup of tea?

07:36.400 --> 07:38.920
No, thank you.
I don't drink... tea.

07:38.920 --> 07:40.560
I'm a coffee man
myself.

07:40.560 --> 07:42.560
Doctors made me
cut back.

07:42.560 --> 07:44.200
Heart condition.

07:44.200 --> 07:46.280
You look...
healthy.

07:46.280 --> 07:48.200
Oh, I am. I am.

07:48.200 --> 07:51.080
I just have to take it
easy for a little while.

07:51.080 --> 07:52.680
No lifting,
no going upstairs.

07:52.680 --> 07:55.680
That's why we're
renting out the room.

07:55.680 --> 07:57.240
It's a big room,

07:57.240 --> 07:59.160
and it's furnished,
and, uh...

07:59.160 --> 08:00.800
It's got a good view.

08:05.160 --> 08:07.640
It sounds...

08:07.640 --> 08:08.720
Ideal.

08:10.720 --> 08:12.280
[Chuckling]
Oh...

08:12.280 --> 08:13.920
[Knock on door]

08:17.720 --> 08:19.960
Don't move.

08:25.160 --> 08:28.240
Ah, Jessie.
This is Mr. Browning.

08:28.240 --> 08:31.280
Would you show him
up to the room, please?

08:31.280 --> 08:34.159
Just like that? I
mean, he just got here.

08:34.159 --> 08:37.159
Now, Jessie. I'm a
good judge of people.

08:37.159 --> 08:38.880
Everything's gonna
work out fine.

09:00.640 --> 09:02.640
I gotta go now.

09:18.160 --> 09:19.640
That's him!

09:19.640 --> 09:23.600
That's the ghost we saw come
out of Mrs. Simpson's ceiling!

09:23.600 --> 09:25.080
Oh, come on, Jessie.

09:25.080 --> 09:28.080
Making up stories isn't
going to change anything.

09:28.080 --> 09:31.120
We need the money,
so Mr. Browning stays,

09:31.120 --> 09:34.280
and I don't want to hear
another word about it.

09:39.160 --> 09:40.720
I didn't move.

09:45.680 --> 09:47.120
He's here.

09:47.120 --> 09:48.120
Who?

09:48.120 --> 09:49.160
The ghost!

09:49.160 --> 09:50.760
He just rented
our room.

09:52.720 --> 09:54.160
Where are you going?

09:54.160 --> 09:57.160
As far away from here
as I can get!

09:57.160 --> 09:58.680
What are you
gonna do?

09:58.680 --> 10:02.040
<i> We are gonna go
talk to Mrs. Simpson.</i>

10:04.720 --> 10:06.600
My ceiling?

10:06.600 --> 10:09.800
He came through my ceiling?

10:09.800 --> 10:12.120
Was it 9:00?

10:12.120 --> 10:14.200
Exactly. We heard
the clock bong.

10:14.200 --> 10:15.520
Then it worked!

10:15.520 --> 10:17.000
What worked?
What worked?

10:17.000 --> 10:18.600
Well...

10:18.600 --> 10:21.120
I was doing...

10:21.120 --> 10:23.120
A welcoming meditation

10:23.120 --> 10:26.120
for an event known
in the psychic world

10:26.120 --> 10:28.120
as the opening.

10:28.120 --> 10:29.640
The opening?

10:29.640 --> 10:30.640
Yes!

10:31.680 --> 10:33.640
It happens...

10:33.640 --> 10:36.120
At the ninth hour
of the ninth day

10:36.120 --> 10:38.120
of
the ninth month.

10:38.120 --> 10:41.120
It's an opportunity for
the spirits to come back

10:41.120 --> 10:44.480
and to complete something
they left undone in life.

10:44.480 --> 10:46.520
Kinda like
a second chance?

10:46.520 --> 10:48.120
Precisely!

10:48.120 --> 10:51.120
But they only have until
midnight of the next full moon

10:51.120 --> 10:52.760
to complete
their task.

10:52.760 --> 10:55.440
Well, when's the next
full moon?

10:55.440 --> 10:57.480
Tomorrow night.

10:57.480 --> 10:59.000
That's not much time.

10:59.000 --> 11:01.920
No! And what makes it
even more difficult

11:01.920 --> 11:05.560
is that in spirit form,
they have no physical power,

11:05.560 --> 11:08.560
so that in order to
accomplish anything,

11:08.560 --> 11:11.560
they have to find... a
human body to inhabit.

11:11.560 --> 11:13.880
Maybe you should
come over

11:13.880 --> 11:15.560
and see this guy.

11:15.560 --> 11:17.080
Ahem.

11:17.080 --> 11:20.280
I don't think your
grandfather would like that.

11:20.280 --> 11:22.760
Besides...
I should stay.

11:22.760 --> 11:24.480
Why?

11:24.480 --> 11:27.680
Because the spirit must
return through the same portal.

11:27.680 --> 11:29.440
He'll be back...

11:29.440 --> 11:31.560
And I want to be
right here.

11:35.640 --> 11:37.080
I can't hear anything.

11:37.080 --> 11:40.080
It's 3:00 in the
morning. He's asleep.

11:40.080 --> 11:42.080
Ghosts don't sleep.

11:42.080 --> 11:43.600
Says who?

11:43.600 --> 11:44.600
Everybody.

11:44.600 --> 11:45.600
Yeah?

11:45.600 --> 11:47.600
Well, I sleep.
Good night.

11:47.600 --> 11:48.600
You can't!

11:48.600 --> 11:50.080
Wanna bet?

11:50.080 --> 11:54.080
What happens if he tried
to take over your body?

11:54.080 --> 11:56.080
Then wake me.

11:56.080 --> 11:59.080
Come on. Let's get
something to eat.

11:59.080 --> 12:01.040
That'll give you
a second wind.

12:01.040 --> 12:03.720
But I don't want
a second wind.

12:10.600 --> 12:11.840
What's that?

12:29.080 --> 12:30.080
No!

12:34.120 --> 12:35.280
Run!

12:38.840 --> 12:40.320
The dresser!

12:50.960 --> 12:53.000
Don't stand in my way.

12:56.360 --> 12:58.760
I'm definitely not
sleeping over again.

12:58.760 --> 13:00.760
It doesn't want me,
Alex.

13:00.760 --> 13:02.280
It wants Grandpa!

13:02.280 --> 13:03.280
What?

13:03.280 --> 13:04.760
Mrs. Simpson
said it.

13:04.760 --> 13:06.280
A spirit has to
take over a body

13:06.280 --> 13:10.360
to do what it came to
do. We gotta warn him!

13:10.360 --> 13:11.960
[Snoring]

13:13.000 --> 13:14.400
Grandpa! Grandpa,
wake up!

13:14.400 --> 13:15.920
What?
What's going on?

13:15.920 --> 13:17.920
The ghost
is after you!

13:17.920 --> 13:19.800
What?

13:19.800 --> 13:21.200
What were
you saying?

13:21.200 --> 13:24.240
The ghost tried
to take your body!

13:24.240 --> 13:26.240
Oh, I don't
believe this.

13:26.240 --> 13:27.720
It's true!

13:27.720 --> 13:29.720
And we can prove it.

13:29.720 --> 13:30.720
Well...

13:30.720 --> 13:32.240
Mmm.

13:33.720 --> 13:35.360
[Knock on door]

13:38.800 --> 13:40.440
He's not even here.

13:47.280 --> 13:48.240
Aah!

13:48.240 --> 13:49.280
Aah!
Aah!

13:52.600 --> 13:55.280
Two can play this game.

13:55.280 --> 13:56.720
Now...

13:56.720 --> 13:58.240
Go to back to bed.

13:58.240 --> 13:59.720
And no more games!

13:59.720 --> 14:01.200
Hmm?

14:03.000 --> 14:05.320
<i>Maybe he is
in the closet.</i>

14:13.960 --> 14:15.520
Aah!
Aah!

14:24.240 --> 14:26.720
I said
get in bed!

14:48.240 --> 14:49.200
Ahem.

14:49.200 --> 14:50.760
[Gasps]
Get away from me!

14:50.760 --> 14:52.480
Ha ha ha.

14:52.480 --> 14:54.080
<i>Where are you going?</i>

14:54.080 --> 14:57.080
The same place
I go every Sunday:

14:57.080 --> 14:58.600
The legion hall.

14:58.600 --> 15:01.640
Shouldn't be gone more
than a couple of hours.

15:04.240 --> 15:06.680
Well, at least
he'll be safe there.

15:06.680 --> 15:08.960
We gotta get help.

15:11.040 --> 15:14.200
The ghost was trying
to get into his body?

15:14.200 --> 15:15.680
Ah! This is wonderful!

15:15.680 --> 15:17.200
No, it's not.

15:17.200 --> 15:18.680
We gotta stop him.

15:18.680 --> 15:21.560
Can't ya put a curse
on him or something?

15:21.560 --> 15:23.320
I'm afraid it doesn't
work that way.

15:23.320 --> 15:24.560
Grandpa's been sick,

15:24.560 --> 15:26.680
and this thing
might hurt him.

15:28.720 --> 15:29.720
Jessie.

15:30.720 --> 15:32.880
You gotta see this.

15:37.720 --> 15:39.760
Recognize anybody?

15:39.760 --> 15:41.920
Sure. That's Grandpa
and Mrs. Simpson

15:41.920 --> 15:42.920
and--

15:42.920 --> 15:44.320
That's him!

15:44.320 --> 15:46.520
That's
the ghost!

15:46.520 --> 15:48.000
But it can't be.

15:48.000 --> 15:50.000
That was my fiance,
Jacob.

15:50.000 --> 15:52.640
You were going to
marry a ghost?

15:52.640 --> 15:54.160
[Laughs]
Heavens, no!

15:54.160 --> 15:57.160
We were going to get married
right after the war, but...

15:57.160 --> 15:58.640
But what?

15:58.640 --> 16:01.640
But I fell in love
with someone else.

16:01.640 --> 16:05.640
I was going to tell
Jacob when he returned...

16:05.640 --> 16:07.720
But he never
made it back.

16:10.200 --> 16:11.800
Grandpa knew him?

16:13.200 --> 16:17.160
Jacob and Samuel were in
the air force together.

16:17.160 --> 16:20.160
During a mission,
their plane was hit.

16:20.160 --> 16:25.480
Your grandfather ordered Jacob
to put on a parachute and jump.

16:27.960 --> 16:29.760
The parachute failed.

16:33.160 --> 16:35.320
Jacob was only
20 years old.

16:37.680 --> 16:39.840
Your grandfather never
should have done that.

16:39.840 --> 16:41.080
That's horrible!

16:41.080 --> 16:44.080
It was Grandpa's
fault Jacob died.

16:44.080 --> 16:45.080
Unfinished business!

16:45.080 --> 16:47.080
An eye for an eye!

16:47.080 --> 16:49.080
He's come back
for revenge!

16:49.080 --> 16:51.600
I gotta get home!

16:51.600 --> 16:53.600
Jessie.

16:53.600 --> 16:56.680
This time...
I'm going with you.

17:27.200 --> 17:28.319
Grandpa!

17:30.400 --> 17:31.800
Grandpa!

17:33.120 --> 17:34.080
Are you OK?

17:34.080 --> 17:35.160
Everything's fine.

17:35.160 --> 17:36.160
Oh.

17:36.160 --> 17:38.840
Mrs. Simpson's here.

17:47.600 --> 17:48.960
Hello, Sara.

17:48.960 --> 17:50.840
Samuel.

17:50.840 --> 17:53.560
Jacob back from the dead?!
I agree he looks like Jacob,

17:53.560 --> 17:55.560
but where do you
find this stuff?

17:55.560 --> 17:57.720
I've always thought of you
as a level-headed woman.

17:57.720 --> 18:00.040
And what has keeping your feet
planted firmly on the ground

18:00.040 --> 18:02.040
ever done for you,
you old goat?

18:02.040 --> 18:05.080
At least I am not the
laughingstock of the whole town!

18:05.080 --> 18:06.600
<i>What's with them?</i>

18:06.600 --> 18:08.080
I don't know.

18:08.080 --> 18:11.080
They can't spend 5 minutes
together without fighting.

18:11.080 --> 18:13.080
I'd better
break this up.

18:13.080 --> 18:15.080
Grandpa: Sara!
[Door slams]

18:15.080 --> 18:16.880
Too late. She's gone.

18:16.880 --> 18:18.560
<i> Now what?</i>

18:18.560 --> 18:21.560
The ghost has to
go back at midnight.

18:21.560 --> 18:24.560
All we have to do is
protect grandpa until then.

18:47.560 --> 18:50.040
"I will love you forever.
Sara."

18:51.960 --> 18:54.280
Grandpa
and Mrs. Simpson?

19:15.640 --> 19:18.000
"Local boy dies
during mission."

19:23.600 --> 19:25.480
<i> He's gonna come
after us, man!</i>

19:25.480 --> 19:27.040
<i> Let's go!</i>

19:27.040 --> 19:28.520
<i> Let's go this way!</i>

19:28.520 --> 19:30.880
<i> Come on! Hurry up!</i>

19:35.200 --> 19:37.400
<i> We're never gonna
get out of here!</i>

19:38.560 --> 19:40.480
Man, oh, man, oh, man.

19:44.640 --> 19:47.040
<i> I think we're gonna
be safe here.</i>

19:47.040 --> 19:48.200
Grandpa!

19:48.200 --> 19:50.520
I found the journal!

19:50.520 --> 19:52.280
Where'd he go?

19:52.280 --> 19:54.160
You were supposed
to watch him.

19:54.160 --> 19:57.280
[Telephone rings]

19:57.280 --> 19:58.360
Hello?

19:58.360 --> 20:01.040
Jessie, why is
your grandfather

20:01.040 --> 20:03.160
standing outside
my house?

20:05.480 --> 20:06.480
Jessie?

20:08.120 --> 20:09.520
We'll be right there!

20:09.520 --> 20:10.720
What's going on?

20:10.720 --> 20:12.800
I think the ghost
got Grandpa. Come on!

20:12.800 --> 20:14.480
[Tap tap tap tap]

20:22.560 --> 20:23.960
Samuel?

20:33.680 --> 20:35.400
[Ghostly voice]
I've missed you, Sara.

20:35.400 --> 20:36.960
Jacob?

20:42.560 --> 20:44.000
Stay away!

20:44.000 --> 20:46.080
I'm not gonna let you
hurt my grandfather!

20:46.080 --> 20:49.680
Your grandfather will
live, but with my spirit.

20:49.680 --> 20:53.080
His will return to
the light in my place.

20:53.080 --> 20:56.000
You and I can be together
again, my sweet Sara.

20:56.000 --> 20:57.000
Grandpa!

20:57.000 --> 20:58.800
Jessie, don't.

20:58.800 --> 21:00.200
That's not your
grandfather.

21:00.200 --> 21:02.640
Jacob, you can't
do this.

21:02.640 --> 21:05.680
He cheated me
out of a life, Sara.

21:05.680 --> 21:08.120
It's his fault
that I died.

21:08.120 --> 21:10.680
It's only fair that I
should live through him.

21:10.680 --> 21:13.320
He tried to save you.
It's in his journal.

21:13.320 --> 21:14.320
What journal?

21:14.320 --> 21:17.480
Grandpa's journal.
Listen.

21:17.480 --> 21:19.000
"The engine caught fire.

21:19.000 --> 21:20.440
"The cockpit
filled with smoke.

21:20.440 --> 21:22.920
"I gave the order
to bail out,

21:22.920 --> 21:25.640
"but we were missing
one parachute.

21:25.640 --> 21:27.760
"Only Jacob and I
were left.

21:27.760 --> 21:30.680
"He didn't know there
was only one chute,

21:30.680 --> 21:33.000
so I lied and said
I would follow him."

21:37.000 --> 21:39.440
"If Jacob knew,
he wouldn't have gone,

21:39.440 --> 21:42.440
"and I didn't want us
both to die.

21:42.440 --> 21:45.920
"I don't know how, but I
landed the plane and survived.

21:45.920 --> 21:47.920
"What unbearable
agony it was

21:47.920 --> 21:51.680
to find that Jacob's chute
failed and he was dead."

21:54.520 --> 21:55.960
That should have
been me.

21:55.960 --> 21:58.040
He tried to save you.

21:58.040 --> 21:59.960
I didn't know.

21:59.960 --> 22:02.000
Oh, Samuel.

22:02.000 --> 22:02.720
[Bong]

22:10.640 --> 22:12.160
Stop it!

22:12.160 --> 22:13.280
No.

22:15.120 --> 22:17.440
Sara, we can be
together again.

22:17.440 --> 22:18.960
I'm sorry, Jacob.

22:18.960 --> 22:21.880
I never got the chance
to tell you, but...

22:21.880 --> 22:24.200
It was Samuel
I really loved.

22:26.200 --> 22:27.600
And all this time,

22:27.600 --> 22:30.640
I've hated him for
something he never did.

22:30.640 --> 22:33.240
Let him go.
He was your friend!

22:33.240 --> 22:35.000
Save him...

22:35.000 --> 22:37.800
Just as he tried
to save you.

22:43.120 --> 22:45.360
I've always
loved you, Sara.

22:45.360 --> 22:47.720
I always will.

22:53.480 --> 22:55.280
Thank him for me.

22:58.720 --> 22:59.640
Grandpa!

22:59.640 --> 23:01.400
Samuel, wake up!

23:01.400 --> 23:03.880
What is it?

23:03.880 --> 23:04.920
Jessie!

23:04.920 --> 23:06.920
How did I get
over here?

23:06.920 --> 23:08.400
Are you OK?

23:08.400 --> 23:09.920
I have no idea.

23:09.920 --> 23:11.400
Sara,
what is this?

23:11.400 --> 23:13.880
I think
it's a new start!

23:15.320 --> 23:17.240
<i> Grandpa Samuel
and Mrs. Simpson</i>

23:17.240 --> 23:19.400
<i> renewed their new
love affair,</i>

23:19.400 --> 23:21.840
proving
that it's never too late

23:21.840 --> 23:24.160
for true love
to be rekindled.

23:24.160 --> 23:25.160
The end.

23:25.160 --> 23:26.200
Good story!

23:26.200 --> 23:27.720
But it's sad.

23:27.720 --> 23:30.240
They lost so many
years together.

23:30.240 --> 23:32.360
They say nothing
is ever lost.

23:32.360 --> 23:35.480
It just comes back
in a different way.

23:36.840 --> 23:41.400
I declare this meeting of
the Midnight Society closed.

23:41.400 --> 23:43.600
And I've got to
mail this. Later!

23:43.600 --> 23:44.600
Come on.

23:44.600 --> 23:46.680
That was a really
good story.

23:46.680 --> 23:48.640
It make you cry,
Frankie?
