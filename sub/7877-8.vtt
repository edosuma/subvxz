00:01.491 --> 00:02.925
(upbeat March plays)

00:02.993 --> 00:05.761
¶ good morning, usa! ¶

00:05.829 --> 00:09.098
¶ I got a feeling that it's
gonna be a wonderful day ¶

00:09.366 --> 00:12.335
¶ the sun in the sky
has a smile on his face ¶

00:12.403 --> 00:16.506
¶ and he's shining a salute
to the american race ¶

00:18.675 --> 00:21.944
¶ oh, boy,
it's swell to say... ¶

00:22.012 --> 00:24.013
¶ good morning, usa! ¶

00:24.081 --> 00:25.615
Ah!

00:25.682 --> 00:33.485
<font color="#ffff00">Sync by honeybunny</font>
<font color="#ffff00">www.addic7ed.com</font>

00:33.757 --> 00:35.291
I have an announcement
to make.

00:35.359 --> 00:36.459
I'm taking a
semester off.

00:38.395 --> 00:39.662
Oh, what did you say?

00:39.730 --> 00:41.998
I was listening to my spit-take
instructional tape.

00:42.066 --> 00:44.700
I'm taking a semester
off from school.

00:44.768 --> 00:46.602
I can't do it
without the tape.

00:46.670 --> 00:47.904
I hesitated.

00:47.971 --> 00:49.505
I'm just,
I'm thinking too much.

00:49.573 --> 00:50.907
Hayley, what are you
talking about?

00:50.974 --> 00:53.609
I'm going to devote my time
to the heifer project.

00:53.677 --> 00:56.212
(gasps) no daughter of mine
is going into fatty porn!

00:56.280 --> 00:59.382
The heifer project is a charity
that provides livestock

00:59.450 --> 01:01.117
To families
in impoverished countries.

01:01.185 --> 01:02.985
So what, you're going over
to africa?

01:03.053 --> 01:04.720
No, I'm going to start
my own business

01:04.788 --> 01:06.389
And give the heifer project
the proceeds.

01:06.457 --> 01:08.191
I know the perfect business
for you to open up!

01:08.258 --> 01:09.559
A dry cleaners!

01:09.626 --> 01:11.394
There's a huge segment
of the population

01:11.462 --> 01:13.896
That is tired of having their
clothes cleaned by koreans.

01:13.964 --> 01:15.665
I am a part of that segment.

01:15.732 --> 01:17.500
Actually, I already have
a business idea--

01:17.568 --> 01:18.868
Organic mulch.

01:18.936 --> 01:20.403
Ugh, that's a terrible idea.

01:20.471 --> 01:21.404
Hayley, listen to me.

01:21.472 --> 01:22.672
I'm giving you good advice.

01:22.739 --> 01:24.707
Take it.
Dad, I'm 18,

01:24.775 --> 01:27.076
I don't need your
advice anymore.

01:28.312 --> 01:30.480
Roger:
I'll take your advice.

01:30.547 --> 01:32.782
If it's love advice.

01:32.850 --> 01:35.485
So, my man say he been workin'
late, but then trina call me

01:35.552 --> 01:37.653
And tell me she seen
his ass in the club!

01:37.721 --> 01:39.822
But then when I ask him
about this nonsense,

01:39.890 --> 01:41.524
He tell me he loves me.

01:41.592 --> 01:43.392
How do I make him
tell me the truth,

01:43.460 --> 01:46.028
But keep our love
million-dollar strong?

01:51.235 --> 01:53.436
Smith, why so glum?

01:53.504 --> 01:56.973
The "c" in cia doesn't stand
for "crestfallen."

01:57.040 --> 01:59.542
But what if
it stood for "cat?"

02:01.000 --> 02:07.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:08.050 --> 02:09.452
Hmm.

02:09.520 --> 02:10.752
So what's bothering you?

02:10.821 --> 02:12.922
Hayley doesn't want
my advice anymore.

02:12.990 --> 02:14.190
Sir, I have terrible news!

02:14.258 --> 02:16.025
I was just doing the
end-of-the-year accounting.

02:16.093 --> 02:17.760
We still have money
left in our budget.

02:17.828 --> 02:20.329
If we don't spend it by the
end of the fiscal year,

02:20.397 --> 02:22.064
They'll cut our budget
for next year!

02:22.132 --> 02:24.567
Damn it, robertson,
speak to me in english.

02:24.635 --> 02:26.969
We have to spend $50,000
by midnight!

02:27.037 --> 02:28.971
Get me everyone.

02:29.039 --> 02:30.473
Everyone?
Everyone!

02:30.541 --> 02:32.808
That's not really my job.

02:36.446 --> 02:38.447
You're right,
it's not your job.

02:38.515 --> 02:41.851
Inform lorraine, have
her send a mass e-mail.

02:41.919 --> 02:44.020
Now, give me a hug.

02:44.087 --> 02:46.222
You scared me.

02:46.290 --> 02:49.025
(bullock hums
a soothing tune)

02:49.092 --> 02:51.360
We're okay.

02:51.428 --> 02:53.062
(continues humming)

02:59.403 --> 03:02.872
Gentlemen, do whatever it takes
to empty our coffers:

03:02.940 --> 03:05.875
Lap dances, champagne dances,
shower dances.

03:05.943 --> 03:08.778
Oh, the things you can buy
with a handful of bills.

03:08.845 --> 03:11.814
It makes me excited,
it gives me the chills!

03:11.882 --> 03:15.017
There'll be filch-arounds,
breeders, hambones and tweeners,

03:15.085 --> 03:17.887
Zobos and debos
and blorps that go eener.

03:17.955 --> 03:20.489
For a one dollar bill you can
pull down their zippers.

03:20.557 --> 03:24.293
I am the snorax,
I speak for the strippers!

03:25.562 --> 03:26.829
Sir.
Hmm?

03:26.897 --> 03:29.131
Sir, this place is filled
with women of ill-repute.

03:29.199 --> 03:30.433
I'm a little uncomfortable.

03:30.500 --> 03:31.834
Damn it, smith,
you think I'm not?!

03:31.902 --> 03:34.103
I'm terrified!

03:34.171 --> 03:37.740
Give this man your finest
trouser arouser.

03:37.808 --> 03:41.043
And you, strangle me
while I brush your hair.

03:44.681 --> 03:45.815
I did it!

03:45.882 --> 03:47.717
I got into space camp!

03:47.784 --> 03:50.186
Seven days of awesomeness
starts tomorrow.

03:50.254 --> 03:51.721
Wow, I wanna go.

03:51.788 --> 03:52.955
Sorry, "roget."

03:53.023 --> 03:54.523
Space camp is
a special privilege

03:54.591 --> 03:56.325
For a select group.

03:56.393 --> 03:57.693
You wouldn't fit in.

03:57.761 --> 03:59.829
Wha-- but it's about space!

03:59.896 --> 04:01.097
<i>I'm from there!</i>

04:01.164 --> 04:02.798
Maybe, but you
weren't invited.

04:02.866 --> 04:06.269
Only a chosen few get to
rub elbows with astronauts

04:06.336 --> 04:08.604
And float weightless in
billion-dollar simulators.

04:08.672 --> 04:10.039
Maybe you should
go to fat camp.

04:10.107 --> 04:11.574
Damn!

04:11.642 --> 04:13.909
Because you're taking up
so much space right now.

04:13.977 --> 04:15.611
Oh, damn!
(laughing)

04:15.679 --> 04:18.748
Look, just forget it and go
back to surgery or whatever.

04:18.815 --> 04:21.050
But I want
to go to space camp!

04:21.118 --> 04:22.685
I'm done with surgery!

04:22.753 --> 04:24.053
I already lost the patient.

04:26.590 --> 04:28.891
<i>Roger:
You know, the thing about
working in a hospital</i>

04:28.959 --> 04:30.760
<i>Is if you don't have
a funny black friend,</i>

04:30.827 --> 04:31.961
<i>Things get pretty boring.</i>

04:32.029 --> 04:33.396
Vanilla bear!

04:33.463 --> 04:35.264
Let's go grab a beer
and see what carla

04:35.332 --> 04:36.632
And the mean janitor
are doing!

04:36.700 --> 04:38.734
(screaming)
take whatever you want!

04:41.405 --> 04:44.674
(rhythmic music playing,
men whooping)

04:44.741 --> 04:46.842
(laughing)
yeah!

04:46.910 --> 04:48.277
Ho-ho!

04:51.081 --> 04:52.782
Is everything okay?

04:52.849 --> 04:54.617
Um, this isn't really my thing.

04:54.685 --> 04:57.353
Maybe this is your thing.

04:57.421 --> 04:59.288
Oh, god! Leg cramp!

04:59.356 --> 05:00.423
Are you all right?

05:00.490 --> 05:01.857
I'm still sexy!

05:01.925 --> 05:03.526
I'm still sexy
for you, baby!

05:03.593 --> 05:04.660
Cramp, huh?

05:04.728 --> 05:06.195
You need to get
a banana in you.

05:06.263 --> 05:08.464
Uh, I don't do that, sir.

05:08.532 --> 05:09.932
No, you need
to eat a banana.

05:10.000 --> 05:11.334
You have a
potassium deficiency.

05:11.401 --> 05:14.236
Hey, shirley,
banana daiquiri, please.

05:14.304 --> 05:16.439
Wow, you listened to me.

05:16.506 --> 05:18.474
Sure, you seem like
you know a thing or two.

05:18.542 --> 05:19.575
You're right.

05:19.643 --> 05:20.676
I do know a thing or two.

05:20.744 --> 05:21.811
I'm stan.

05:21.878 --> 05:23.145
I'm tanqueray.

05:23.213 --> 05:24.714
Tanqueray, let me
break it down for you.

05:24.781 --> 05:26.949
Exposing your body
for money is wrong.

05:27.017 --> 05:29.251
The only people who should
see you naked are your mother,

05:29.319 --> 05:31.320
Your doctor and your
best friend in third grade.

05:31.388 --> 05:33.923
Just that one time,
under the waterfall.

05:33.990 --> 05:35.424
Jeremy davis.

05:35.492 --> 05:37.727
The point is, you could do
so much more with your life.

05:37.794 --> 05:39.028
You really think so?

05:39.096 --> 05:41.497
Take my advice,
you really can.

05:46.570 --> 05:48.170
(gasps)
you were right!

05:48.238 --> 05:50.306
I'm better!
See?

05:50.374 --> 05:52.074
Wish my daughter listened
as well as you do.

05:52.142 --> 05:53.809
If she could just see...

05:53.877 --> 05:56.912
Hey, tanqueray, how would
you like to operate

05:56.980 --> 05:58.247
Your own dry cleaners?

05:58.315 --> 05:59.882
I don't know. Yes?
I don't know.

05:59.950 --> 06:01.217
You know.

06:01.284 --> 06:04.320
Come, take a drive
with a stranger.

06:04.388 --> 06:05.955
(bullock grunting)

06:06.022 --> 06:08.691
(groaning)

06:08.759 --> 06:10.025
More, more!

06:11.194 --> 06:13.462
(grunting, groaning)

06:13.530 --> 06:16.298
Yeah, I so deserve this.

06:16.366 --> 06:18.167
Do it!

06:18.235 --> 06:20.970
(grunting
with each impact)

06:24.808 --> 06:27.476
Hayley, it's impolite
to fiddle with trash.

06:27.544 --> 06:29.044
It's not trash.

06:29.112 --> 06:31.080
I'm collecting organic compounds
for the mulch I'm developing.

06:31.148 --> 06:32.515
Well, good for you.

06:32.582 --> 06:34.483
You don't have to be
such a bitch about it.

06:34.551 --> 06:35.751
(door opens, closes)

06:35.819 --> 06:37.253
What a day.

06:37.320 --> 06:38.854
I am pooped.

06:38.922 --> 06:40.256
Stan, who's this?

06:40.323 --> 06:41.457
Oh, right.

06:41.525 --> 06:42.691
Everyone, this is tanqueray.

06:42.759 --> 06:43.726
She's moving in!

06:43.794 --> 06:46.061
I'm gonna make her
a success.

06:48.331 --> 06:50.366
Oh, we're wearing
the same outfit.

06:50.434 --> 06:51.534
Take a good
look, sweetie.

06:51.601 --> 06:53.002
This is how
you wear that.

06:53.069 --> 06:54.403
Yeah!

06:54.471 --> 06:57.039
Nine years of
gymnastics, bitch.

07:00.155 --> 07:02.556
Roger, please show tanqueray
to steve's room.

07:02.624 --> 07:04.325
She'll sleep there
while he's at space camp.

07:04.392 --> 07:05.826
And get her
out of those clothes.

07:05.894 --> 07:07.995
And then rob her, kill her,
cut off her head and hands

07:08.063 --> 07:09.597
And bury her by
the crick-- got it.

07:09.664 --> 07:11.398
Actually, no,
just get her changed.

07:11.466 --> 07:14.101
Oh, we just avoided a
funny misunderstanding.

07:14.169 --> 07:16.136
I almost cut
your hands off!

07:16.204 --> 07:18.038
All right, come on,
I'll race you upstairs.

07:18.106 --> 07:21.008
Stan, what is going on?

07:21.076 --> 07:23.844
Hayley had her chance
to benefit from my
wisdom and guidance.

07:23.912 --> 07:25.913
Now that's all going
to tanqueray.

07:25.981 --> 07:28.115
I'm gonna transform her
from scum of the earth

07:28.183 --> 07:31.018
To captain of industry!

07:31.086 --> 07:33.787
Uh, hey, hayley, can you
come over here a second?

07:33.855 --> 07:35.256
I wanna show you something.

07:36.691 --> 07:39.493
What, uh, what did
hayley's face look like

07:39.561 --> 07:41.061
When I just told her all that?

07:41.129 --> 07:43.030
Is she regretting not
taking my advice yet?

07:43.098 --> 07:44.265
What?

07:44.332 --> 07:45.666
<i>Oh, did I call you over?</i>

07:45.734 --> 07:47.468
I-I meant your mother.

07:48.637 --> 07:50.271
Hey, francine.

07:50.338 --> 07:52.106
Can you, uh,
take a look at this?

07:57.612 --> 07:59.179
The first step
in teaching tanqueray

07:59.247 --> 08:03.017
To run a successful business
is enrolling her in school.

08:03.084 --> 08:04.985
Tanqueray.

08:05.053 --> 08:06.620
Tanqueray, wake up.

08:06.688 --> 08:08.722
Your skanking days are over.

08:08.790 --> 08:11.091
Your new business school
classes start in half an hour.

08:12.928 --> 08:15.663
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
no, no, no, no, no!

08:15.730 --> 08:17.798
Don't ever let me
see you naked, okay?

08:17.866 --> 08:18.866
I'm sorry.

08:18.934 --> 08:19.867
It's all right.

08:19.935 --> 08:21.001
No harm done.

08:21.069 --> 08:22.469
I'm completely fine.

08:22.537 --> 08:24.638
Just meet me in the car
in 15 minutes.

08:24.706 --> 08:27.341
Francine, meet me
in the shower immediately.

08:32.047 --> 08:33.981
(chattering)

08:34.049 --> 08:36.750
(cheering)

08:38.453 --> 08:41.587
Welcome... To a space camp!

08:41.655 --> 08:43.991
You guys are in for a treat,

08:44.058 --> 08:47.027
Because instead of doing our
normal space camp activities,

08:47.095 --> 08:48.896
We'll be spending all week

08:48.964 --> 08:51.565
Meeting nasa's
earthbound heroes:

08:51.633 --> 08:54.335
Our wonderful
administrative support staff!

08:54.402 --> 08:58.439
(light applause)

08:58.506 --> 09:01.475
Uh, but we're still going to be
doing cool space stuff, right?

09:01.543 --> 09:03.510
Like flight simulation,

09:03.578 --> 09:05.713
Or maybe a turn
with that jet pack?

09:05.780 --> 09:07.815
Nope, that was last week
or next week.

09:07.882 --> 09:10.551
Now, put your hands together

09:10.618 --> 09:14.455
For the members of today's
eight-hour panel!

09:14.522 --> 09:19.426
First up, head of human
resources, judith collins!

09:22.764 --> 09:27.968
Next, director of payroll
disbursement, karen snur!

09:31.773 --> 09:34.775
Houston, we don't
have a problem

09:34.843 --> 09:36.944
With any of our
building's paint,

09:37.012 --> 09:39.213
Thanks to acting head
of paint and plaster repair,

09:39.280 --> 09:43.083
Art... Fitzgerald-yee!
Art!

09:45.520 --> 09:49.356
Keep it going for vice
president of peer mentoring:

09:49.424 --> 09:53.327
Ellen "the duck" ducker.

09:53.395 --> 09:55.562
(quacking)

09:55.630 --> 09:57.364
(laughing)
(quacking)

10:02.137 --> 10:04.805
There's my little
future dry cleaner!

10:04.873 --> 10:06.073
How was your exam today?

10:06.141 --> 10:08.409
It made me sad until
I drew a bird on it.

10:10.011 --> 10:11.445
You didn't turn it in?!

10:11.513 --> 10:12.846
Guess what, you guys?

10:12.914 --> 10:14.681
The city decided
to use my mulch!

10:14.749 --> 10:16.083
They've ordered a hundred bags!

10:16.151 --> 10:18.685
That buys the heifer project
a hen and half a burro.

10:18.753 --> 10:20.821
Congratulations, honey!

10:20.889 --> 10:22.222
How's tanqueray doing?

10:22.290 --> 10:24.258
Is she a dry cleaning mogul?

10:24.325 --> 10:26.226
Is she getting a de-luxe
apartment in the sky?

10:26.294 --> 10:27.694
(chuckling smugly)

10:27.762 --> 10:30.431
I don't know if that's funny
enough for you to leave on!

10:30.498 --> 10:33.767
Stan, why don't you just admit
your plan isn't working?

10:33.835 --> 10:35.869
Hayley's doing
fine on her own.

10:35.937 --> 10:38.772
And tanqueray's obviously
not cut out for school.

10:38.840 --> 10:41.575
I colored my bird.

10:41.643 --> 10:44.011
You're right, francine.

10:44.079 --> 10:45.746
I'm gonna take her
out of school

10:45.814 --> 10:47.915
And go straight to
phase two of my plan.

10:47.982 --> 10:49.983
Four more strippers!

10:50.051 --> 10:51.552
They're moving in
with tanqueray.

10:51.619 --> 10:54.354
Stan, that's four more
mouths to feed!

10:54.422 --> 10:56.156
And eight more hands to work

10:56.224 --> 10:58.025
The dry cleaning business
I bought this morning.

10:58.093 --> 10:59.193
What?!
Don't worry, honey.

10:59.260 --> 11:00.828
When it takes off,
we'll be rich.

11:00.895 --> 11:03.464
Hayley's gonna be so sorry
she didn't listen to me.

11:03.531 --> 11:05.466
All right, let's get
you ladies settled in.

11:05.533 --> 11:06.967
Now, some ground rules.

11:07.035 --> 11:09.603
All of you are gonna get on
my menstrual cycle,

11:09.671 --> 11:11.538
Which begins next Wednesday.

11:11.606 --> 11:13.841
Anyone on their flow right now?

11:13.908 --> 11:15.209
Stop.

11:15.276 --> 11:19.513
Stop it, okay?

11:19.581 --> 11:20.581
Stop.

11:22.784 --> 11:24.818
This place blows.

11:24.886 --> 11:27.187
I can't believe we're
stuck here all week.

11:27.255 --> 11:29.623
My bed is short
and wide!

11:29.691 --> 11:33.527
You're sleeping
the wrong way!

11:33.595 --> 11:35.729
Hey, it's a message
from home.

11:35.797 --> 11:37.197
"start streaming
this video."

11:37.265 --> 11:40.234
Oh, thank god, some contact
with the outside world!

11:40.301 --> 11:42.803
¶ ¶

11:42.871 --> 11:44.705
Hey, that's my room!

11:44.772 --> 11:48.642
Hey steve, remember how you said
I couldn't go to space camp?

11:48.710 --> 11:50.811
Well, check it out,
you smug little bastard:

11:50.879 --> 11:52.646
Five strippers
are living in your room

11:52.714 --> 11:53.947
And they're totally horny.

11:54.015 --> 11:56.083
Melinda, allison, go!

11:56.151 --> 11:58.752
(moaning)

11:58.820 --> 12:00.487
Ooh!

12:00.555 --> 12:02.489
They're kissing where we
practice kissing!

12:02.557 --> 12:03.790
We gotta get home.

12:03.858 --> 12:05.325
We gotta break
out of this place.

12:05.393 --> 12:08.061
See you in hell, (bleep)!

12:08.129 --> 12:09.196
Okay, girls.

12:09.264 --> 12:11.632
Pillow fight!

12:11.699 --> 12:14.635
Oops! Forgot I put
some sodas in there.

12:17.372 --> 12:19.806
Ladies, six of the ten
richest men in america

12:19.874 --> 12:22.309
Made their fortune off of dry
cleaning or other businesses.

12:22.377 --> 12:24.511
So let's get in there
and make some money!

12:24.579 --> 12:26.613
(cheering)

12:26.681 --> 12:29.850
Oh, man-- landlord
gave me the wrong key.

12:29.918 --> 12:32.019
Jackass, coked-up armenian.

12:32.086 --> 12:33.153
It's all right.

12:33.221 --> 12:34.888
We can do what we want.
It's our door.

12:34.956 --> 12:36.623
(shattering)

12:38.593 --> 12:39.993
This is not our dry cleaners.

12:40.061 --> 12:42.429
I think we're a block over.
Go, go, go, go, go.

12:50.238 --> 12:51.405
Girls, I don't understand.

12:51.472 --> 12:52.940
Why don't we have
any customers?

12:53.007 --> 12:55.576
Well, sometimes it takes a while
for a business to get going.

12:55.643 --> 12:57.477
Like when bosoms opened up.

12:57.545 --> 13:01.415
No one went to bosoms, right,
and now people go to bosoms.

13:01.482 --> 13:02.649
(door opening)
(gasps)

13:02.717 --> 13:05.252
Oh, hi. Sorry.

13:05.320 --> 13:06.820
Are you still helping
number zero?

13:06.888 --> 13:08.021
Because I'm next.

13:08.089 --> 13:09.323
I'm one.
What do you want, hayley?

13:09.390 --> 13:11.692
I just wanted to give you
a store-warming present.

13:11.759 --> 13:13.327
A bag of my mulch.

13:13.394 --> 13:16.563
It's filled with crap,
just like you.

13:18.566 --> 13:21.368
Now that is funny enough
for you to leave on!

13:23.705 --> 13:25.939
So, how's business?

13:26.007 --> 13:28.208
Great! Look at all
the clothes we have!

13:28.276 --> 13:31.345
Okay, I'm going to explain
this one more time.

13:31.412 --> 13:33.480
I bought the clothes
and spruced up the store

13:33.548 --> 13:35.115
So it would look like
we have customers,

13:35.183 --> 13:37.317
Thus attracting
real customers.

13:37.385 --> 13:38.919
What is so hard to understand
about that?

13:38.987 --> 13:39.987
The other girls get it.

13:40.054 --> 13:41.021
Right, deborah?

13:41.089 --> 13:44.324
(gasping)

13:44.392 --> 13:45.425
(deep inhale)

13:45.493 --> 13:46.493
I'm hungry.

13:46.561 --> 13:48.562
Come on, we need
to make this work!

13:48.630 --> 13:51.064
For god's sake, I bought a
floor-length chinchilla here!

13:51.132 --> 13:55.102
Maybe we should all just go back
to stripping like tanqueray.

13:55.169 --> 13:56.870
Wait, tanqueray's doing what?!

13:56.938 --> 13:58.605
She felt bad your business
was failing,

13:58.673 --> 14:00.707
So she went to the strip club
to make your money back.

14:00.775 --> 14:02.142
No, no!

14:02.210 --> 14:04.244
If she goes back to stripping,
then I've failed,

14:04.312 --> 14:05.646
And hayley was right
not to listen to me.

14:05.713 --> 14:08.248
I can't let that happen!

14:08.316 --> 14:11.551
Hey, has stan tried to rape
either of you guys yet?

14:11.619 --> 14:12.586
No.
No.

14:12.654 --> 14:14.121
That's weird,
right?

14:18.126 --> 14:23.964
(ladies cheering)

14:24.032 --> 14:25.565
Is tanqueray here?

14:25.633 --> 14:27.367
(gentle, feminine voice):
Oh, no, she worked
this afternoon,

14:27.435 --> 14:29.202
But now it's ladies' night,
so she went home.

14:29.270 --> 14:32.039
Wow, your voice is sweet.

14:32.106 --> 14:34.574
Yeah, my gonads are tucked
inside my abdomen.

14:34.642 --> 14:37.644
I was born with what doctors
call "bashful testicles."

14:37.712 --> 14:38.745
Oh.

14:38.813 --> 14:40.047
(phone ringing)

14:40.114 --> 14:41.148
Hello.

14:41.215 --> 14:43.417
Stan, we just got a call
from the bank.

14:43.484 --> 14:46.386
They say we haven't paid our
car payment or the mortgage.

14:46.454 --> 14:49.356
Is this because you sunk all
our money into the dry cleaners?

14:49.424 --> 14:51.825
Let's look at the positives
here, francine.

14:51.893 --> 14:54.695
I could've been born
with bashful testicles.

14:54.762 --> 14:56.963
You tell the bank
to think about that.

14:57.031 --> 14:57.864
Man:
You!

14:57.932 --> 14:59.833
With the sixty-inch chest.

14:59.901 --> 15:00.967
How hairy are you?
What?

15:01.035 --> 15:02.436
Uh...

15:02.503 --> 15:04.338
Damn it, I don't have time
for you to estimate!

15:04.405 --> 15:05.739
Yes!

15:05.807 --> 15:07.174
You're perfect!

15:07.241 --> 15:08.909
I had three dancers
cancel on me.

15:08.976 --> 15:10.877
How'd you like
to make $600.

15:10.945 --> 15:12.045
A day?
An hour!

15:12.113 --> 15:14.648
Tax-free, all cash.

15:14.716 --> 15:17.584
I really can't-- cash?

15:17.652 --> 15:19.219
If you're having
money problems,

15:19.287 --> 15:21.855
This could be your
possible solution.

15:21.923 --> 15:23.123
What do I do?

15:23.191 --> 15:24.558
Now gyrate!

15:24.625 --> 15:27.127
Come on, shake it!

15:28.262 --> 15:30.530
Yeah, you're a natural.

15:30.598 --> 15:32.265
Now rip my pants off.

15:32.333 --> 15:34.134
Do it!

15:34.202 --> 15:35.435
Now kiss me!
What?

15:35.503 --> 15:37.804
I said get out there!

15:37.872 --> 15:40.040
Protect yourself, victor.

15:40.108 --> 15:43.043
I can't take another
heartbreak right now.

15:48.071 --> 15:50.140
How's the mulch business
going, sweetie?

15:50.208 --> 15:52.142
Well, I'm not doing
as well as I thought.

15:52.210 --> 15:53.777
Once I paid all my
costs and taxes,

15:53.845 --> 15:55.145
I'm barely breaking even.

15:55.213 --> 15:57.547
Well, look, maybe you should
forget about

15:57.615 --> 15:59.616
All those starving kids
you let down

15:59.684 --> 16:01.918
And think about how long
you've been single.

16:01.986 --> 16:03.687
Mom!
Join a gym!

16:03.754 --> 16:05.188
Check it out, I'm back.

16:05.256 --> 16:06.690
Bam!

16:06.757 --> 16:08.725
Told you the dry cleaning
business would be a success.

16:08.793 --> 16:11.895
My advice is so good, even
strippers can benefit from it.

16:11.963 --> 16:14.764
Bong! Zing!

16:14.832 --> 16:16.132
This is all
from dry cleaning?

16:16.200 --> 16:17.267
That's right, baby.

16:17.335 --> 16:18.535
We turned it around.

16:18.603 --> 16:21.438
Francine, I found
this g-string outside.

16:21.505 --> 16:24.007
Please wash it and then
I will put it back outside.

16:30.581 --> 16:33.416
(screaming)

16:35.353 --> 16:37.754
(screaming continues)

16:55.740 --> 16:57.707
(yelling)

16:57.775 --> 17:00.343
(screaming)

17:05.148 --> 17:08.385
(all screaming)

17:08.452 --> 17:11.320
(sirens blaring,
dogs barking)

17:11.388 --> 17:13.390
(techno dance music playing)

17:13.457 --> 17:17.060
(women cheering)

17:17.127 --> 17:18.094
How are they?

17:18.162 --> 17:20.195
Typical Tuesday crowd.

17:20.263 --> 17:23.032
Everybody wants to grab it
but nobody wants to pay for it.

17:23.099 --> 17:24.968
Worst part is I keep
getting aroused.

17:25.036 --> 17:26.903
How long before the
dance (bleep) go away?

17:26.971 --> 17:28.471
You can still get erections?

17:28.539 --> 17:30.040
You're straight?

17:30.107 --> 17:33.677
(women cheering)

17:33.744 --> 17:35.879
I don't know if I want
to be here, roger.

17:35.947 --> 17:38.281
Come on, a little (bleep)
will cheer you right up.

17:38.349 --> 17:39.716
So your mulch business
is going under.

17:39.784 --> 17:41.418
It's not the end of the world.

17:41.485 --> 17:44.354
Yeah, it just means
my dad was right.

17:44.422 --> 17:46.289
Are you supposed to be
pregnant or fat?

17:46.357 --> 17:47.924
Eight months preggers.

17:47.992 --> 17:49.492
They don't make you buy
the two-drink minimum

17:49.560 --> 17:50.627
When you're knocked up.

17:50.695 --> 17:51.728
Snuck in my own.

17:51.796 --> 17:53.029
This is a party ball.

17:54.465 --> 17:55.565
(liquid trickling)

17:55.633 --> 17:57.434
Ah, perfect pour.

17:58.936 --> 18:01.571
That, however,
was urine I just drank.

18:04.275 --> 18:07.577
(cheering, howling)

18:07.645 --> 18:11.381
I'm starting to get
the very bad feeling

18:11.449 --> 18:12.882
That none of these boys

18:12.950 --> 18:14.718
Are going to go
full pickle tonight.

18:14.785 --> 18:16.786
Dj: Okay, ladies,
open up your purses

18:16.854 --> 18:20.757
And show some love
for a real renaissance man:

18:20.825 --> 18:23.960
Michael dangle-low!

18:24.028 --> 18:25.795
¶ ¶

18:32.536 --> 18:33.470
(cheers and screams)

18:33.537 --> 18:35.572
Oh, my god.

18:35.639 --> 18:37.540
I know, look at that meat!

18:37.608 --> 18:38.875
French me for a 20!

18:38.943 --> 18:39.976
Roger, that's my dad!

18:40.044 --> 18:40.977
Stan?!

18:41.045 --> 18:42.145
Ooh!

18:48.119 --> 18:49.652
(screaming)

18:53.290 --> 18:55.625
Hayley, this isn't how
I wanted you to find out,

18:55.693 --> 18:57.660
But your daddy is
a brilliant painter.

18:57.728 --> 19:00.997
Dad, is this where all the dry
cleaning money was coming from?

19:01.065 --> 19:02.766
No wonder it was all
in crumpled ones.

19:02.833 --> 19:04.434
You are such a liar!

19:04.502 --> 19:05.802
Hayley, wait!

19:05.870 --> 19:08.338
Hang on, I paid for
a three-song dance.

19:08.406 --> 19:09.639
Not now, roger.
Vic!

19:09.707 --> 19:11.941
Hey, shelly.
Hi, victor.

19:12.009 --> 19:15.612
Listen, your stallion here is
trying to run out on his dance.

19:15.679 --> 19:17.247
Vic, listen.
You listen.

19:17.314 --> 19:20.483
Shelly was a dancer here for
three years, now she's family.

19:20.551 --> 19:22.185
You keep her happy.

19:22.253 --> 19:24.354
(groaning)

19:24.422 --> 19:25.588
No, no!

19:25.656 --> 19:27.690
Lean forward and look back.

19:27.758 --> 19:30.193
That's what I like.

19:30.261 --> 19:32.362
And make it rain,
make it rain, make it--

19:32.430 --> 19:34.964
Look at me
like you're a virgin!

19:38.135 --> 19:39.803
Oh, tanqueray, you leaving?

19:39.870 --> 19:42.238
<i>Yeah, I'm gonna try
and get in playboy.</i>

19:42.306 --> 19:44.174
I've got a lot of
good short stories.

19:44.241 --> 19:46.676
This suitcase is filled
with science fiction.

19:46.744 --> 19:48.845
I'm sorry my father
messed with your life

19:48.913 --> 19:50.380
With his stupid advice.

19:50.448 --> 19:51.748
I'm so pissed at him.

19:51.816 --> 19:53.550
Hey, at least he's taking
an interest in you.

19:53.617 --> 19:54.984
More than my dad ever did.

19:55.052 --> 19:58.121
And besides, he can be
pretty smart sometimes.

19:58.189 --> 20:00.190
He was right about
putting a banana in me.

20:00.257 --> 20:01.724
Well, goodbye.

20:03.994 --> 20:05.695
(car starting)

20:05.763 --> 20:07.063
Did that girl just leave?

20:07.131 --> 20:09.833
I think she stole
my jewelry!

20:09.900 --> 20:11.634
Hayley, I'm sorry.

20:11.702 --> 20:13.970
I didn't want to admit
my dry cleaning business

20:14.038 --> 20:15.405
Was a bad idea

20:15.473 --> 20:17.807
And well, the truth is,
you were right.

20:17.875 --> 20:20.110
You're 18; you don't need
my advice anymore.

20:20.177 --> 20:21.778
Yeah, maybe I don't.

20:21.846 --> 20:25.115
But it's nice to know you
care enough to offer it.

20:26.784 --> 20:28.585
The good silver's missing!

20:28.652 --> 20:30.753
I'm calling the police!

20:30.821 --> 20:33.723
Actually, I pawned it all
to pay down my debt.

20:33.791 --> 20:36.726
You know, nothing cheers you up
like being in a pawn shop.

20:36.794 --> 20:38.695
Because chances are,
you're going to see

20:38.762 --> 20:40.763
A flintstones alarm clock.

20:45.169 --> 20:47.237
Steve, where are
the strippers?!

20:47.304 --> 20:48.605
I don't know!

20:48.672 --> 20:49.906
Hey, look who's back!

20:49.974 --> 20:51.207
Where are the girls?!

20:51.275 --> 20:52.642
Oh, you missed them.
They're gone.

20:52.710 --> 20:53.877
(all groaning)

20:53.944 --> 20:55.078
But here's a dirty g-string.

20:55.146 --> 20:56.246
Enjoy.

20:56.313 --> 20:57.380
(sniffing, sighing)

20:57.448 --> 20:58.615
It's your dad's.

20:58.682 --> 21:01.384
(guffawing)

21:01.452 --> 21:03.019
I made it rain,
made it rain,

21:03.087 --> 21:04.387
I made it rain
on them boys!

21:04.388 --> 21:05.388
