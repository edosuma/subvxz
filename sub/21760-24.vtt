01:26.330 --> 01:28.880
You know Pirate Pegleg
gets cranky

01:28.880 --> 01:30.540
when he doesn't get
his proper share.

01:34.830 --> 01:38.750
I just love The Adventures
of Dog Juan.

01:38.750 --> 01:40.580
This isn't Dog Juan.

01:40.580 --> 01:42.500
This is
The Puppies of Penzance.

01:42.500 --> 01:47.290
I think it's the coolest
gold, diamond adventure.

01:55.080 --> 01:58.170
Don't play innocent,
Ms. de Vil.

01:58.170 --> 02:00.420
You know Uncle Sam gets cranky

02:00.420 --> 02:02.420
when he doesn't get
his proper share.

02:02.420 --> 02:04.210
But these were gifts!

02:04.210 --> 02:07.120
Rewards for my keen
business actions

02:07.120 --> 02:09.670
and my unerring
sense of style!

02:09.670 --> 02:13.920
And to keep me from publishing
certain embarrassing photos.

02:13.920 --> 02:15.750
The government
gets a percentage

02:15.750 --> 02:17.920
of all your income,
Ms. de Vil.

02:17.920 --> 02:19.790
We're your silent partner

02:19.790 --> 02:21.540
until you get greedy...

02:21.540 --> 02:24.920
then we tend to
get very noisy!

02:32.080 --> 02:34.120
What's taken you so long?

02:34.120 --> 02:36.120
And why are you
covered with mud?

02:36.120 --> 02:40.210
We found the perfect tax shelter
for your gifts, Ms. de Vil.

02:40.210 --> 02:43.250
Yeah, it's an old hidden cave
down in the swamp.

02:43.250 --> 02:47.080
Yeah. We drew you a map
on how to get there.

02:47.080 --> 02:48.670
-Hmm...

02:48.670 --> 02:51.420
-Man: Now, let's stop
being naughty...

02:51.420 --> 02:53.710
and fork over
the loot, Ms. de Vil!

02:53.710 --> 02:54.960
Oh!

02:54.960 --> 02:56.120
You hold the door shut.

02:59.120 --> 03:01.620
I sure hope
she doesn't lose the map.

03:03.000 --> 03:05.040
That's why I made
a copy of it.

03:07.210 --> 03:09.880
Ms. de Vil?

03:13.290 --> 03:18.790
Oh dear, another one who wants
to do it the hard way.

03:31.250 --> 03:34.500
Rolly:
Prepare, matey, to tell
the whereabouts of the treasure!

03:36.210 --> 03:37.170
Wahoo!

03:39.790 --> 03:42.000
I told you you wouldn't
get away with this,

03:42.000 --> 03:43.290
Pirate Drumstick.

03:43.290 --> 03:45.750
I don't like
playing pirates, Lucky.

03:45.750 --> 03:48.120
Now hand over the maps as I...

03:48.120 --> 03:51.000
Spot:
How many times
do I have to tell you?

03:51.000 --> 03:53.420
I don't have a map!

03:54.750 --> 03:56.580
A-- a treasure map!

03:56.580 --> 03:58.500
A treasure map!

04:00.040 --> 04:02.080
A treasure map!

04:02.080 --> 04:06.040
Why do they always mark
the spot with an "X"?

04:06.040 --> 04:09.040
That's only on TV,
dodo-brain.

04:11.830 --> 04:13.620
All:
Treasure!

04:15.670 --> 04:17.880
Spot:
A cache of golden eggs!

04:17.880 --> 04:20.000
Extra large, of course.

04:20.000 --> 04:24.460
Cadpig:
A golden sunflower
of peace and harmony.

04:26.120 --> 04:28.750
Rolly:
A lifetime supply
of Gold Medal Kibble.

04:28.750 --> 04:30.290
Oh, papa!

04:32.080 --> 04:35.000
Lucky:
Gold, diamonds, adventure!

04:36.540 --> 04:37.540
All:
Huh?

04:45.540 --> 04:49.000
Oh great, we each
only got one piece.

04:49.000 --> 04:51.080
Well, if we each
got one piece,

04:51.080 --> 04:53.330
then it's every pup
for himself.

04:55.420 --> 04:57.830
Hey! Somebody untie me!

04:59.210 --> 05:02.080
Let's see.
Two paces left, all right,

05:02.080 --> 05:04.040
three paces right...

05:04.040 --> 05:06.250
Oh. Ugh.

05:06.250 --> 05:10.000
Ugh! These boots were made
for, ugh, walking.

05:10.000 --> 05:12.080
Ugh! Not wading.

05:16.290 --> 05:18.040
Ugh!

05:18.040 --> 05:20.880
Tsk, tsk, tsk.

05:20.880 --> 05:24.080
It's not nice to fool
the federal government.

05:25.290 --> 05:26.420
Agh!

05:34.920 --> 05:38.880
Ooh, original re-sss-ipe.

05:38.880 --> 05:39.960
Sss!

05:48.790 --> 05:51.080
Huh. Looks like
a shortcut to me.

05:58.210 --> 06:00.380
I hate shortcuts.

06:13.000 --> 06:14.120
Oh my!

06:14.120 --> 06:17.290
Just look at that.

06:17.290 --> 06:18.920
Uh...

I see someone green

06:34.120 --> 06:37.420
ooh, and you have
a very long life line.

06:37.420 --> 06:38.750

12:32.750 --> 12:34.540
not to play
in the house.

12:35.710 --> 12:38.120
Now, I've got work
to do, so...

12:38.120 --> 12:40.250
go see what Anita's up to
or something.

12:41.540 --> 12:43.210
-Hey, hey, hey,

12:44.620 --> 12:46.920
You are not allowed
on the furniture!

12:46.920 --> 12:49.580
Now off the sofa, Lucky.

12:49.580 --> 12:52.880

12:57.420 --> 12:59.500

13:10.080 --> 13:12.120

it'd be different.

13:14.920 --> 13:18.420
Yeah, we could sleep
on the sofa every night.

Hi, guys!

13:19.620 --> 13:20.830
Where are you goin'?

It's light, it's strong,

14:27.500 --> 14:30.620
it's got shine,
it's got texture, it's got--

14:32.500 --> 14:33.420
Termites!

14:41.000 --> 14:42.170
-Roger: Ah, don't worry!

14:42.170 --> 14:43.250
I can fix it.

14:43.250 --> 14:46.920
Distressed wood.
Hmm, that's chapter two.

14:49.620 --> 14:51.420
Cruella:
There's simply no other way.

14:51.420 --> 14:53.120
You all must leave.

14:53.120 --> 14:54.960
Go! Clear out!

14:54.960 --> 14:56.500
There's not a moment to lose!

14:56.500 --> 14:59.420
But vacate the house?

14:59.420 --> 15:03.420
Anita, how can I design
a line with wooden clothes

15:03.420 --> 15:06.170
with a termite hotel
next door

15:06.170 --> 15:09.290
83, 84, 85...

15:12.330 --> 15:14.710
Come on, let's hurry it up!

15:14.710 --> 15:16.250
87, or--

15:16.250 --> 15:18.000
-You can count them later!
-Ooh!

15:18.000 --> 15:21.330
Let's move
before my clothing line
turns to sawdust!

15:24.500 --> 15:26.880
Roger, are you sure
we didn't leave anyone behind?

15:35.170 --> 15:36.670
What are we today, Jasper?

15:36.670 --> 15:37.710
Scuba divers?

15:37.710 --> 15:40.080
No, we're not scuba divers.

15:40.080 --> 15:41.710
We're exterminators.

15:41.710 --> 15:43.540
I rented everything we need.

15:43.540 --> 15:44.620
Here, read this book.

15:44.620 --> 15:48.250
Pest Control Made Easy.

15:48.250 --> 15:51.250
Come on! I hope we made it
in time for lunch.

15:51.250 --> 15:53.250
But aren't you
not supposed to eat

15:53.250 --> 15:55.120
30 minutes after you swim?

15:55.120 --> 15:58.920
That's before you swim.
I know about these things.

15:58.920 --> 16:01.500
Hello! We're home!

16:01.500 --> 16:04.210
Rolly:
Hey, where is everybody?

16:05.920 --> 16:07.380
How weird.

16:07.380 --> 16:08.880
Where'd they all go?

16:08.880 --> 16:10.460
Who's gonna feed us?

16:10.460 --> 16:12.670
Abducted! All of 'em!

16:12.670 --> 16:16.380
Now, now, let's try
to think about this logically.

16:18.380 --> 16:20.670
We're all gonna die!

16:20.670 --> 16:21.960
Wait a minute.

16:21.960 --> 16:23.830
You know what this means?

16:23.830 --> 16:25.080
All:
What?

16:25.080 --> 16:28.420
There's no one to
tell us what to do...

16:28.420 --> 16:29.880
or not to do!

16:31.000 --> 16:32.290
Yes!

16:42.120 --> 16:46.080
I like fruity little water
with just a hint of rust
in the nose.

16:46.080 --> 16:47.500
Whoo-hoo!

17:00.670 --> 17:02.170
Rolly:
All right!

17:02.170 --> 17:05.290
Race that steam,
monkey puppy!

17:10.380 --> 17:13.460
You have got to
stop this right-- Aah!

17:26.710 --> 17:31.170
Can't a dog have a little
sensory deprivation in peace?

17:44.000 --> 17:45.620
What's that?

17:45.620 --> 17:48.500
Someone's trying
to break in.

17:48.500 --> 17:51.170
Not while we're in charge.

17:52.420 --> 17:53.710
Got it.

17:58.710 --> 18:00.790
It's those rotten puppies.

18:00.790 --> 18:02.290
What are they doin' here?

18:03.460 --> 18:05.460
We gotta lock
the cellar door.

18:05.460 --> 18:06.920
They can get in there!

18:13.040 --> 18:15.250
-Here, puppies,

18:15.250 --> 18:17.420
come to Uncle Jasper.

18:22.580 --> 18:24.580
I got an idea.
Follow me!

18:40.120 --> 18:41.670
All right, puppies,

18:41.670 --> 18:43.120
come out with your hands up.

18:46.380 --> 18:47.790
It's the cops.

18:47.790 --> 18:49.580
-Take cover!
-Aah!

18:51.170 --> 18:54.210
Hey, they bought it.

18:55.380 --> 18:57.880
Let me draw your attention to...

18:57.880 --> 19:01.080
a small,
but growing problem.

19:02.880 --> 19:04.710
Hey, what kind
of cops are they?

19:04.710 --> 19:08.750
They're trying to
lure us out with popcorn.

19:08.750 --> 19:11.250
The dirty dogs.

19:19.250 --> 19:20.210
Oh!

19:35.250 --> 19:36.830
Yikes!

19:47.790 --> 19:48.830
Ouch!

19:59.620 --> 20:02.290
-All right!

20:02.290 --> 20:03.540
Huh?

20:19.210 --> 20:21.170
You guys okay?

20:21.170 --> 20:22.920
-Yeah.
-Uh-huh.

20:22.920 --> 20:27.210
Sure. I always make that sound
when I'm drowning.

20:27.210 --> 20:30.250
We're gonna fix you
once and for all.

20:43.540 --> 20:45.540
Oh Hey!

20:46.670 --> 20:48.670
I told you we were
missing some puppies.

20:48.670 --> 20:50.880
Yeah, good thing
we decided to check.

20:50.880 --> 20:52.330
-No!

20:52.330 --> 20:53.460
What have they done?

20:53.460 --> 20:56.120
Cruella is not gonna
get away with this.

21:02.380 --> 21:04.750
Were we glad
to see you guys.

21:04.750 --> 21:06.830
I guess it's okay
to have someone keep

21:06.830 --> 21:08.880
an eye on us sometimes.

21:08.880 --> 21:10.420
Yeah.

21:10.420 --> 21:12.380
Can we offer you
some popcorn?

21:12.380 --> 21:14.580
Roger on phone:
Yeah, your so-called
exterminators

21:14.580 --> 21:16.210
destroyed my house!

21:16.210 --> 21:18.880
They did what?

21:18.880 --> 21:21.330
Oh dear.

21:21.330 --> 21:22.920
Well, the basement
is completely wet,

21:22.920 --> 21:24.000
the furniture
is all soaked,

21:24.000 --> 21:26.170
we've got nothing
but broken windows
in the house!

21:26.170 --> 21:27.750
It's a complete mess!

21:27.750 --> 21:29.710
Yes, yes, yes,
don't worry, Rappaport.

21:29.710 --> 21:31.670
I'll check
into the whole thing.

21:31.670 --> 21:34.330
No, no, they won't be
doing the work.

21:34.330 --> 21:36.750
All right, Rupert.
Good night.

21:38.750 --> 21:40.000
-And as for you--

21:46.710 --> 21:48.380
Termites!

21:48.380 --> 21:50.920
You brought me
the Dearlys' termites!

21:55.080 --> 21:57.380
Yummy!
