03:10.280 --> 03:14.480
- What the fuck are you doing?
- Goliath tipped me off.

03:18.840 --> 03:20.600
We need drugs, Elia.

03:24.720 --> 03:29.880
Soldiers make war.
The commander only strategizes.

03:30.880 --> 03:32.720
Time for strategy is over.

03:34.040 --> 03:35.440
Or not?

03:36.440 --> 03:38.280
Let's go shopping, guys!

04:48.960 --> 04:51.000
But what the fuck are you doing there?

05:17.120 --> 05:18.680
Get outta here.

05:42.760 --> 05:44.600
Pieces of shit!

05:49.720 --> 05:51.600
Let's go.

06:12.920 --> 06:16.558
<i>This is one of the scenes
of last night's shooting</i>

06:16.560 --> 06:20.318
<i>that took place around 2am
in the Forcella area.</i>

06:20.320 --> 06:22.838
<i>The reason for the attack
is still not clear,</i>

06:22.840 --> 06:26.078
<i>but investigators are following
the lead of gang rivalry.</i>

06:26.080 --> 06:28.678
<i>Terror among the residents,</i>

06:28.680 --> 06:31.758
<i>who fear this may only be
the beginning of a new feud,</i>

06:31.760 --> 06:35.838
<i>like the one that took over
the historic center last year.</i>

06:35.840 --> 06:38.518
<i>The victims' names
have not yet been released,</i>

06:38.520 --> 06:41.998
<i>but they're all very young,
between 18 and 23.</i>

06:42.000 --> 06:47.520
<i>The police commissioner of Naples
has arrived on the crime scene.</i>

06:56.120 --> 06:58.440
We haven't got a gram of stuff left.

06:59.880 --> 07:01.920
Only he knew where it was.

07:03.600 --> 07:06.640
Yet another fine gift
from that scumbag Valerio.

07:10.120 --> 07:13.918
The time's come to wipe off
the Capaccios of the face of the earth.

07:13.920 --> 07:16.078
You're right.

07:16.080 --> 07:18.398
But before shooting,
we need to know if we can.

07:18.400 --> 07:20.920
Do you hear what you're saying,
Pure'n'Simple?

07:22.120 --> 07:24.078
You also got a kid coming.

07:24.080 --> 07:27.678
What are you gonna teach him?

07:27.680 --> 07:30.238
That if they kill your brother
you look the other way?

07:30.240 --> 07:33.160
You don't understand a fucking thing.

07:34.440 --> 07:36.960
I'm willing to die for Forcella.

07:38.720 --> 07:40.880
But there's gotta be a good reason.

07:42.160 --> 07:44.840
If you want to kill the Capaccios,
I'm with you.

07:47.960 --> 07:50.438
But also if you want
to negotiate with them.

07:50.440 --> 07:53.318
We can't afford a war right now.

07:53.320 --> 07:56.118
Enzo, you gotta talk to them.

07:56.120 --> 07:58.200
We're on our own.

08:12.560 --> 08:16.558
The Capaccios came onto our turf
because they thought they could.

08:16.560 --> 08:20.480
We can't negotiate with them,
the war's already begun.

08:22.320 --> 08:25.640
But I agree with you:
we can't be on our own.

08:54.040 --> 08:55.720
Donna Patrizia...

09:15.920 --> 09:21.438
Did you hear what happened?
The Capaccios have gotten out.

09:21.440 --> 09:24.880
This is a problem for everybody,
including you.

09:26.800 --> 09:31.240
Nicola betrayed us to go with them,
didn't he? Valerio did the same.

09:33.000 --> 09:34.960
They took all our stashes.

09:39.080 --> 09:40.760
I'm sorry.

09:42.840 --> 09:45.398
You gotta decide.

09:45.400 --> 09:47.638
You wanna be with us

09:47.640 --> 09:51.040
or wait till they come
and fucking take Secondigliano?

09:54.320 --> 09:58.078
For now I can't go to war with anyone.

09:58.080 --> 10:02.560
I can't help you,
you have to handle it on your own.

10:03.800 --> 10:07.118
Central Naples' issues can't come here.

10:07.120 --> 10:10.120
Secondigliano has
to remain independent.

10:49.200 --> 10:52.518
Mr Savastano,
the staff will be here soon.

10:52.520 --> 10:55.560
It's best if you're not seen here
during the day.

10:58.360 --> 11:01.278
D'you see I changed
the name on the door?

11:01.280 --> 11:03.360
Thank you.

11:06.880 --> 11:09.878
Anyway, don't worry.

11:09.880 --> 11:13.880
I just came to shake my new CEO 's hand.

11:21.360 --> 11:24.000
- Is that a problem?
- No.

11:25.400 --> 11:28.518
Tomorrow there's the press conference
for the reopening of the site.

11:28.520 --> 11:31.880
I've written a short speech
and I want to remember Alberto.

11:33.240 --> 11:36.198
I'll say he was an honest
businessman and a great man

11:36.200 --> 11:40.040
and that his death in a tragic
accident has affected us all.

11:43.520 --> 11:45.160
And what more is there to say?

11:51.960 --> 11:54.080
And if they ask me questions?

11:58.280 --> 12:00.438
You smile,

12:00.440 --> 12:04.360
and say that the streets are no longer
safe, so we're taking to the sky.

12:30.320 --> 12:32.440
We're on our own, guys.

12:37.880 --> 12:39.520
But we can't stop.

12:43.080 --> 12:45.000
I need to know if you're with me.

12:46.640 --> 12:49.800
Because I have to count on all of you.

12:53.000 --> 12:54.958
We gotta know all
about the Capaccios:

12:54.960 --> 12:58.718
what they do, when they sleep,
when they piss.

12:58.720 --> 13:03.080
If we have friends in their area,
now's the time to ask for favors.

13:04.680 --> 13:08.038
Forcella's ours and no one
must take it away from us.

13:08.040 --> 13:10.760
What are you waiting for? Come on!

13:12.520 --> 13:15.318
Let's go, Pure'n'Simple.

13:15.320 --> 13:16.880
Let's go, guys.

14:05.640 --> 14:07.600
Enzo's closed off the neighborhood.

14:09.280 --> 14:11.118
He's locked himself in a cage.

14:11.120 --> 14:13.798
He won't stop till he's killed you.

14:13.800 --> 14:17.880
He's got no coke, no money, he hasn't
even got the loyalty of his soldiers.

14:19.000 --> 14:21.558
We just have to wait.

14:21.560 --> 14:24.160
All water runs to the sea.

14:25.120 --> 14:29.158
If we lose control of Forcella
someone's gonna step in.

14:29.160 --> 14:31.200
And not necessarily a friend of yours.

14:34.480 --> 14:36.520
Ferdinando, you know he's right?

14:38.920 --> 14:43.080
But if he's here, it means
he and his friends have got an idea.

15:13.160 --> 15:16.678
A friend of my cousin's
from the Luzzatti neighborhood

15:16.680 --> 15:20.038
says that Crazy goes for a massage
at a Chinese-parlor every week.

15:20.040 --> 15:22.800
Tonight too, she gave me the address.

15:23.800 --> 15:26.358
Enzo, are you serious?

15:26.360 --> 15:29.878
We don't know the place,
we don't know if he goes alone.

15:29.880 --> 15:32.678
But there's no time.

15:32.680 --> 15:36.358
We can't miss this opportunity,
we need to take out that asshole.

15:36.360 --> 15:38.640
The sooner the better.

15:40.320 --> 15:42.720
If you don't feel like it, never mind.

15:44.680 --> 15:47.120
Tonight we'll whack the bastard.

15:54.360 --> 15:56.280
You did good.

16:18.480 --> 16:20.760
You can sit there, Mr Savastano.

16:32.600 --> 16:35.878
So, Mr Savastano, if you're sure
you want to go ahead,

16:35.880 --> 16:40.318
we can do the first treatment tomorrow,
both for the scar and the tattoo.

16:40.320 --> 16:44.718
It's a very simple procedure
with a local anaesthetic.

16:44.720 --> 16:46.678
Thank you.

16:46.680 --> 16:50.160
- You want to meet him?
- Who?

16:52.200 --> 16:54.560
The new Gennaro Savastano.

17:35.520 --> 17:37.440
Where is he?

17:51.160 --> 17:53.160
Stay here, I'll go check.

18:41.440 --> 18:43.678
What was that?

18:43.680 --> 18:46.278
- Let's go see.
- Enzo said to stay here.

18:46.280 --> 18:48.678
As soon as they come out, we gotta go.

18:48.680 --> 18:50.838
You stay here. Let's go, bro'.

18:50.840 --> 18:53.320
Where are you going?

18:54.680 --> 18:57.838
- What the fuck happened?
- It was a trap, he sold us out.

18:57.840 --> 19:00.560
They're in the hallway.

19:14.800 --> 19:16.440
We gotta get outta here!

19:26.400 --> 19:29.158
The scumbag sold us out, Enzo!

19:29.160 --> 19:30.640
Let's go!

19:36.920 --> 19:41.840
- What happened?
- Nothing, go. Go, go!

19:51.520 --> 19:53.480
Fuck it!

19:56.360 --> 19:58.000
We're losing.

20:02.800 --> 20:04.600
We're losing our brothers.

20:21.880 --> 20:23.760
Are you okay?

20:33.000 --> 20:37.000
Valerio said he once saw something
in me that's not there now.

20:39.000 --> 20:42.598
If he didn't see it,
that doesn't mean it's not still there.

20:42.600 --> 20:45.440
Besides, what Valerio said
doesn't count anymore.

20:46.640 --> 20:48.320
He was a rat.

20:58.130 --> 21:01.488
I'm really pleased
you're doing this for yourself.

21:01.490 --> 21:04.170
The doctor said it's nothing,
don't worry.

21:10.370 --> 21:12.210
What's the matter?

21:17.730 --> 21:19.888
Tiziana was a little tense.

21:19.890 --> 21:22.048
I'll drop in on the press
conference first,

21:22.050 --> 21:25.210
so I can check
everything's under control.

21:27.890 --> 21:30.690
You know you can't go, right?

21:35.210 --> 21:36.808
I know you've changed,

21:36.810 --> 21:40.130
but for the rest of the world
you're Gennaro Savastano.

21:41.530 --> 21:43.890
The boss of Secondigliano.

21:45.890 --> 21:49.810
But if it will put your mind at rest,
I'll go to the press conference.

22:01.970 --> 22:04.730
What the fuck have I done
all this shit for?

22:07.770 --> 22:10.090
The airport, the consortium,
the company...

22:12.410 --> 22:15.448
Only to end up like my father,

22:15.450 --> 22:18.770
who lived his whole life
trapped in a golden cage.

22:23.170 --> 22:27.450
The difference is everything
your father did, he did it for himself.

22:32.050 --> 22:34.490
You're doing it for your son.

22:37.290 --> 22:40.090
And that's something
you mustn't forget.

22:59.610 --> 23:03.208
What the fuck did you do?
It's a miracle I'm alive!

23:03.210 --> 23:06.368
- I see you're still here.
- And so's Enzo.

23:06.370 --> 23:09.050
- And that's a problem.
- Yeah, but calm down.

23:23.090 --> 23:26.288
We're risking big,

23:26.290 --> 23:28.610
and we can't afford it anymore.

23:29.970 --> 23:31.888
We have to destroy Enzo
before he recovers.

23:31.890 --> 23:35.130
If you're in such a hurry
why don't you kill Enzo yourself?

23:38.050 --> 23:41.848
Because no one would want a rat
in charge of Forcella.

23:41.850 --> 23:44.570
But Blue Blood's no longer up to it,
like Patrizia.

23:46.050 --> 23:49.168
And when stuff goes bad
you throw it out.

23:49.170 --> 23:50.850
Don't you?

23:56.250 --> 23:58.290
See what you can do.

24:27.770 --> 24:32.170
Valerio said if anything happened
to him, I was to give you this.

24:43.810 --> 24:46.250
For my son you were his family.

24:47.330 --> 24:49.530
That's what he told me.

24:51.490 --> 24:53.690
"His family."

26:18.010 --> 26:20.330
We've lost another battle
but it's not over.

26:23.690 --> 26:26.768
We need to collect as much money
as we can for more drugs,

26:26.770 --> 26:30.528
but we need to keep something
for our friend's families,

26:30.530 --> 26:33.288
because no one

26:33.290 --> 26:36.890
must say that
we've been weakened in Forcella.

26:44.330 --> 26:47.408
Go ask for the week's money
from those who haven't paid yet,

26:47.410 --> 26:51.810
then go to the warehouse,
bring back everything we've got left.

26:59.410 --> 27:02.650
You handle security
in the neighborhood, is that clear?

27:07.730 --> 27:09.448
I'll take care of the drugs.

27:09.450 --> 27:11.050
Let's go.

27:16.930 --> 27:19.690
I'm not letting you go alone,
I'll come too.

27:21.450 --> 27:23.448
I made up my mind, Pure'n'Simple.

27:23.450 --> 27:25.370
Will you tell me what happened?

27:27.810 --> 27:32.168
- He wants to go to his contact alone.
- No way.

27:32.170 --> 27:35.728
You're about to have a kid.
We already lost too many brothers.

27:35.730 --> 27:37.488
I'm going alone, it's easier.

27:37.490 --> 27:40.010
Enzo's right, you need
to stay in the neighborhood.

27:42.570 --> 27:44.290
I'll come with you.

27:49.410 --> 27:51.090
I'm good.

28:03.010 --> 28:04.450
I'm on my way.

29:02.930 --> 29:05.370
You're done, Blue Blood.

29:07.170 --> 29:09.970
This is the last time you fuck up.

29:13.890 --> 29:16.130
You wanna kill me
like you did with Valerio?

29:25.890 --> 29:27.290
Don't push me.

29:40.610 --> 29:42.610
He left me a note.

29:44.970 --> 29:48.328
You went over to the Capaccios
to screw him first, and then me.

29:48.330 --> 29:49.770
You're nobody!

30:07.890 --> 30:11.448
He said there's a big shot behind you.

30:11.450 --> 30:12.810
I want to know who he is.

30:17.730 --> 30:19.970
Why don't you ask your buddy?

30:25.650 --> 30:27.770
Because the dead can't talk.

30:50.930 --> 30:55.008
We didn't know anything,
we don't know how Enzo found out.

30:55.010 --> 30:59.088
We got nothing to hide. If you
don't believe it, you can kill us.

30:59.090 --> 31:00.850
No, I believe you.

31:03.530 --> 31:05.970
That's why you're still here.

31:08.370 --> 31:10.848
But if you want to stay alive,
bring me my brother.

31:10.850 --> 31:13.770
- We'll need time.
- We don't know where he is.

31:18.050 --> 31:21.210
If Ferdinando doesn't come back,
you know what happens?

31:25.570 --> 31:28.770
A dog without a master
doesn't live long on the street.

31:32.970 --> 31:34.450
Leave it.

31:49.490 --> 31:52.010
- Only I can save you.
- Yeah?

31:54.730 --> 31:57.648
But you gotta tell me who's backing you.

31:57.650 --> 32:00.570
- And what would that change for you?
- Just tell me!

32:01.770 --> 32:04.250
If I tell you now, you'll kill me.

32:05.250 --> 32:08.008
It'd be the end of me.

32:08.010 --> 32:10.770
You decide how much you want to suffer.

32:13.450 --> 32:14.810
But you gotta talk.

32:20.410 --> 32:23.930
Because Valerio died trying
to find this out.

32:31.010 --> 32:34.330
- And I gotta finish what he started.
- Then finish it!

32:42.890 --> 32:46.168
- You're done playing crazy.
- You wanna do it?

32:46.170 --> 32:48.930
He's shitting himself.
Now let's fuck him up.

32:50.810 --> 32:52.770
When?

32:55.530 --> 32:57.970
- On my way.
- Sack of shit!

33:02.690 --> 33:05.128
Enzo, Anna called.

33:05.130 --> 33:09.010
She's giving birth. I gotta go.

33:47.330 --> 33:49.130
Good morning.

33:50.930 --> 33:52.570
Good morning.

33:54.410 --> 33:58.288
Can Simone come play at our place
one of these days?

33:58.290 --> 34:00.530
Pietro would like that a lot.

34:03.290 --> 34:06.088
We'll come pick him up at your place

34:06.090 --> 34:07.770
and take him home again.

34:14.330 --> 34:16.690
I wouldn't want to bother you.

34:18.810 --> 34:21.130
But that's not the truth.

34:22.810 --> 34:26.848
And we said we'd always
tell each other the truth.

34:26.850 --> 34:30.408
The problem isn't bothering me.

34:30.409 --> 34:32.370
It's who I am.

34:36.770 --> 34:39.969
But now, also thanks to you,
I know who I am.

34:53.330 --> 34:55.010
Come along, sweetheart.

35:17.530 --> 35:19.690
Anna, what happened?

35:21.530 --> 35:23.210
Is everything all right?

35:24.930 --> 35:27.528
What is it? Is everything all right?

35:27.530 --> 35:29.448
Baby...

35:29.450 --> 35:33.170
Before you judge,
listen to what they have to say.

35:34.770 --> 35:37.610
I want our son
to grow up with a father.

35:56.330 --> 35:57.890
Pure'n'Simple...

36:00.290 --> 36:02.170
Enzo's losing.

36:03.730 --> 36:06.690
You know it yourself,
things can't go on like this.

36:08.730 --> 36:10.288
They're with us too.

36:10.290 --> 36:13.248
We don't want to fight a war
between brothers

36:13.250 --> 36:16.048
and we're sick to fucking death
of losing our men.

36:16.050 --> 36:18.010
We've done big things together.

36:20.730 --> 36:23.728
But we're not kids anymore.

36:23.730 --> 36:26.848
Pure'n'Simple, it's better for everyone
if we go over to the Capaccios.

36:26.850 --> 36:29.810
And what's the price for all this?

36:30.930 --> 36:33.290
You know all too well.

36:53.250 --> 36:54.810
Answer.

36:59.210 --> 37:02.210
- Enzo.
- All good?

37:05.490 --> 37:07.530
We gotta celebrate.

37:09.730 --> 37:12.170
What are you going to call him?

37:17.530 --> 37:21.328
Anna wants to call him Valerio
like his grandfather.

37:21.330 --> 37:23.250
But I said no.

37:24.490 --> 37:26.970
My son can't have a traitor's name.

37:29.890 --> 37:33.170
We gotta go. They're coming.

37:35.450 --> 37:37.450
I want to name him after you.

37:38.810 --> 37:40.770
Because you're my brother.

37:45.290 --> 37:47.290
I'll see you later, Enzo.

38:17.490 --> 38:19.370
What's going on?

38:20.530 --> 38:22.850
I want to show you something.

38:37.610 --> 38:39.690
Tell us who's behind you.

38:47.810 --> 38:50.850
Your husband's lucky.

38:52.610 --> 38:55.090
Because he fucked you twice.

38:56.890 --> 39:00.210
Once in bed and once in business.

39:01.930 --> 39:06.810
They want to take Secondigliano,
him and his family.

39:08.690 --> 39:12.130
And they want to stick it up your ass.

39:23.810 --> 39:26.450
They wiped out all my brothers.

39:27.450 --> 39:30.010
Forcella's in the Graduate's hands now.

39:34.090 --> 39:35.610
You can still make it.
