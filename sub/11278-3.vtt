00:06.100 --> 00:07.500
          Here you go.          

00:07.500 --> 00:08.500
                          Hey...

00:08.600 --> 00:10.300
    Something wrong?            

00:10.300 --> 00:11.600
                  Yes, I'll say.

00:11.600 --> 00:14.300
            You didn't ask me if
         I needed anything else.

00:14.300 --> 00:16.000
      Do you see this roll      
     of dollar bills here?      

00:16.100 --> 00:17.000
        Yeah.                   

00:17.100 --> 00:18.300
            This is your tip.   

00:18.300 --> 00:20.400
 I've set it aside in advance.  

00:20.400 --> 00:22.200
      Now here's the deal.      

00:22.200 --> 00:24.500
         Every time you         
      do something wrong,       

00:24.500 --> 00:26.700
I take a dollar bill, see?      

00:26.700 --> 00:29.400
That way, I get decent service. 
          Understood?           

00:29.400 --> 00:31.200
    Fair enough.                

00:31.300 --> 00:32.500
Here's my deal for you.         

00:32.600 --> 00:36.200
Every time you take away        
a dollar, I do this.            

00:39.500 --> 00:41.300
                  That just cost
             you another dollar.

00:44.900 --> 00:46.200
            There, you happy?   

00:46.200 --> 00:47.900
Your tip money's all gone.      

00:47.900 --> 00:50.100
That's just great.              
'Cause I just got my own.

I would like to nominate        

02:23.700 --> 02:26.200
as the stupidest creature       
            on Earth            

02:26.200 --> 02:28.200
  the one who awakens each day  

02:28.300 --> 02:31.500
        to drive through        
      gridlocked traffic,       

02:31.500 --> 02:34.300
 to sit in a windowless office  
  breathing re-circulated air,  

02:34.400 --> 02:36.300
then returns home and collapses 
        into a stupor--         

02:36.300 --> 02:38.400
 only to do the same damn thing 
         all over again         

02:38.400 --> 02:39.900
    every day until he dies.    

02:40.000 --> 02:41.300
    Looking forward to that     
      vacation, eh, Fras?       

02:41.300 --> 02:43.200
 You bet. We're going to Maui.

02:47.700 --> 02:49.400
        Still having problems   
    with the computer, Sammy?   

02:49.500 --> 02:51.500
    No, I think I've figured    
        out what to do.         

02:52.800 --> 02:55.100
  Kiss your keyboard good-bye.  

02:55.200 --> 02:56.700
FRASIER:                        
Sam!                            

02:56.700 --> 02:58.700
Sam, Sam, give me the bat.      
         Come sit down.         

03:00.000 --> 03:02.500
Now, I'm sure that Lilith would 
be delighted to help you        

03:02.600 --> 03:03.800
             with your computer.

03:03.800 --> 03:06.100
      She tells me she has quite
    an affinity for machines.   

03:06.100 --> 03:08.000
    Naturally, you could have   
 knocked me over with a feather.

03:08.000 --> 03:11.000
What is it with these           
machines, anyway?               

03:11.000 --> 03:12.700
Computers... faxes,             
voice mail.                     

03:12.700 --> 03:15.200
You know, when I ran this       
place in the old days,          

03:15.200 --> 03:16.800
I had everything                
I needed... right up here.      

03:16.800 --> 03:19.100
              Brains, Sam?      

03:19.200 --> 03:20.700
No, good hair.                  
Brains... (scoffs)              

03:22.000 --> 03:24.200
I'm serious, you know.          

03:24.300 --> 03:26.400
Good looks can open doors.      

03:26.400 --> 03:28.500
Good hair blows them            
off their hinges.               

03:31.800 --> 03:34.100
Sammy, what are you going       
to do about the computer?       

03:34.100 --> 03:36.000
Rebecca's gonna come            
over here and fix it.           

03:36.000 --> 03:38.000
I just have to wait             
until she shows up.             

03:38.000 --> 03:39.100
 What about the auto show, Sam? 

03:39.200 --> 03:41.200
      Don't you want to go      
      see the new models?       

03:41.200 --> 03:42.000
Ah, that's all right.           

03:42.000 --> 03:43.900
I know where they're            
staying, Woody.                 

03:44.000 --> 03:46.600
            Uh, Sammy, we're out
                    of pretzels.

03:46.600 --> 03:50.000
        Oh, sorry.              

03:50.000 --> 03:52.400
        Hey, we're out          
            of pretzels.        

03:52.400 --> 03:55.100
I think that's what I meant when
I said we were out of pretzels. 

03:55.100 --> 03:57.100
 Sorry I was so cryptic before. 

03:57.100 --> 03:58.600
    I don't understand this.    

03:58.700 --> 04:00.000
    We were supposed to get     
     a big shipment today.      

04:00.000 --> 04:03.200
I mean, I, ordered 20 bags      
     from the distributor.      

04:03.300 --> 04:06.900
  I even faxed it on Rebecca's  
      stupid fax machine.       

04:07.000 --> 04:08.600
        Oh, well.               

04:08.600 --> 04:09.900
          "Oh, well"?!          

04:09.900 --> 04:12.900
  Sammy, there are those of us  
    who need their pretzels.    

04:12.900 --> 04:14.400
What am I supposed to do,       

04:14.400 --> 04:16.700
  go down to the grocery store  
    and buy you some?           

04:16.700 --> 04:18.000
  And get some Beer Nuts, too.  

04:18.000 --> 04:19.399
      These are antiques.       

04:19.500 --> 04:22.700
     You know, I have a yen     
    for some Cheese Doodles.    

04:22.800 --> 04:24.400
                          CLIFF:
                 Hey, uh, Sammy,

04:24.400 --> 04:26.500
while you're out there, will you
  pick me up some cough syrup?  

04:26.600 --> 04:27.700
  I've got a-- little tickle.   

04:27.800 --> 04:30.200
 All right, fine. I'm gonna do  
      this once, you guys,      

04:30.300 --> 04:31.200
    but you gotta remember--    

04:31.300 --> 04:33.000
    I'm supposed to be          
     the boss around here,      

04:33.100 --> 04:34.200
not your errand boy.            

04:34.200 --> 04:35.300
                  Feed my meter.

04:39.400 --> 04:41.400
     I've got those 20 bags     
     of cement you ordered.     

04:41.500 --> 04:43.200
         What 20 bags of cement?

04:43.200 --> 04:44.600
            I ordered 20 bags   
                    of pretzels.

04:44.700 --> 04:45.700
        I faxed my order        

04:45.800 --> 04:47.600
                  to Amalgamated
                    Snack Foods.

04:47.600 --> 04:50.500
Oh yeah, we often               
intercept their orders          
so we can push cement.          

04:51.500 --> 04:54.300
          Maybe what happened is
      I faxed the wrong company.

04:54.300 --> 04:55.400
That happens all the time.      

04:55.400 --> 04:56.900
            So you'll take it   
                    back for me?

04:56.900 --> 04:58.600
Nope. You still got             
to pay for it.                  

04:58.600 --> 05:00.300
Good thing it happens           
all the time.                   

05:00.300 --> 05:03.500
Here, sign here. I'll           
get the rest of it.             

05:03.500 --> 05:04.600
    I've got no time to do this.

05:04.600 --> 05:06.100
        I have more important   
                things going on.

05:06.100 --> 05:06.900
    Thanks.                     

05:06.900 --> 05:08.500
      Woody, do something       
    with this cement.           

05:08.500 --> 05:09.800
                Sure thing, Sam.

05:09.800 --> 05:11.800
Listen, while you're out,       
        can you pick up         

05:11.800 --> 05:16.900
some aggregate, a water trough, 
  a shovel and a wheelbarrow.   

05:16.900 --> 05:21.700
 Now, what am I going to build? 

05:26.200 --> 05:30.000
    All right, here you go,     
          you clowns.           

05:30.000 --> 05:31.600
    Cheese Doodles...           

05:33.500 --> 05:36.900
     Beer Nuts, pretzels...     

05:38.300 --> 05:41.100
          Uh, where's           
     the cough syrup, Sam?      

05:41.100 --> 05:43.400
 Oh, I knew I forgot something. 

05:43.500 --> 05:48.400
Geez, Sammy, tickles just don't 
go away by themselves, you know.

05:48.400 --> 05:49.800
        I'm sorry.              

05:49.800 --> 05:52.500
Oh, man, I know it's going      
to get in my ears.              

05:52.500 --> 05:55.100
I just know it.                 

05:55.100 --> 05:59.000
        Sam, I believe I ordered
                Cheese Doodles--

05:59.100 --> 06:02.800
                  not "Imitation
            Puffed Cheese" food.

06:02.800 --> 06:05.600
  So, I got the plain wrapped.  
     What's the difference?     

06:05.700 --> 06:09.900
    "Can also be used           
     as packing material."      

06:09.900 --> 06:12.100
See, it's efficient, too.       

06:12.100 --> 06:14.100
        "Keep out of the        
      reach of children."       

06:14.200 --> 06:16.400
                You know, Sammy,

06:16.400 --> 06:18.400
you shouldn't have to cut       
    corners like this.          

06:18.500 --> 06:20.800
If you're having money problems,
    maybe we can help.          

06:20.800 --> 06:23.600
      Come here, you guys.      

06:23.600 --> 06:25.800
Listen, you, you remember       
that raise I gave you guys      

06:25.800 --> 06:26.900
     a couple of weeks ago?     

06:26.900 --> 06:29.200
    How much does it really     
          mean to you?          

06:29.300 --> 06:32.200
                    More than my
            children's lives.   

06:32.200 --> 06:34.900
      Okay, Carla gets to       
        keep her raise.         

06:34.900 --> 06:38.100
     What do you say, Wood?     

06:38.100 --> 06:40.700
Well, I suppose I can put       
it off a couple of months,      

06:40.700 --> 06:42.000
if it'll help.                  

06:42.000 --> 06:44.700
     Aw, yeah, thanks, man,     
        you're a brick.         

06:44.700 --> 06:47.700
In return for this concession,  
I think the group medical plan  

06:47.700 --> 06:49.500
should be expanded              
to include dental.              

06:51.800 --> 06:54.900
      I'm just barely keeping my
          head above water here.

06:54.900 --> 06:56.200
    What are you doing to me?   

06:56.200 --> 06:58.100
              You're acting like
        selfish, greedy leeches.

06:58.200 --> 06:59.800
    Well, why should we work    
        here then, huh?         

06:59.900 --> 07:01.500
  Because we're family, honey.  

07:03.000 --> 07:04.800
  Why is everybody treating me  

07:04.800 --> 07:06.300
like I'm the biggest jerk       
        on Earth?               

07:06.300 --> 07:08.000
 Don't worry about that, Sammy, 
             okay?              

07:08.000 --> 07:10.000
     You're the owner here.     
You have responsibilities.      

07:10.000 --> 07:12.100
If they can't handle that,      
     that's their problem.      

07:12.100 --> 07:13.000
         Yeah, thanks.          

07:13.000 --> 07:14.200
              Can I have another
                beer, please?   

07:14.300 --> 07:15.500
I can't run a tab anymore.      

07:15.600 --> 07:17.700
I'm going to have to            
take cash on this.              

07:17.700 --> 07:19.500
      Or maybe you are the      
     biggest jerk on Earth.     

07:19.500 --> 07:20.800
         Maybe you are!         

07:20.800 --> 07:23.400
Fine, you know, just fine.      

07:25.000 --> 07:27.000
What do you guys want           
from me, huh?                   

07:27.100 --> 07:28.500
Free medical plans--            
raises all around.              

07:28.500 --> 07:31.200
  How about free beer and all   
the pretzels you can eat?       

07:31.200 --> 07:32.300
  Can I get you anything else?  

07:32.300 --> 07:33.500
            Can we have         
          "fondue night"?       

07:33.600 --> 07:34.700
        No.                     

07:34.700 --> 07:37.600
  Not everybody likes fondue.   

07:41.800 --> 07:43.200
              Hi.               

07:43.300 --> 07:44.700
         Hi, Miss Howe.         

07:44.700 --> 07:46.400
Oh, Woody, you don't work       
for me anymore.                 

07:46.400 --> 07:48.300
You don't need to call          
me "Miss Howe."                 

07:48.400 --> 07:49.600
Just call me Rebecca.           

07:49.700 --> 07:52.800
                Oh, hi, Rebecca.
                      (chuckles)

07:52.900 --> 07:56.100
"Rebecca," I kind of like that. 

07:56.100 --> 07:58.500
    What do you think, Norm?    

07:58.500 --> 08:00.900
    Now, now, Woody. Come on.   

08:00.900 --> 08:03.000
I'm sorry, Mr. Peterson.        

08:03.000 --> 08:04.500
It's just not me,               
Miss Howe.                      

08:07.100 --> 08:09.200
Oh, great, there you are.       

08:09.300 --> 08:11.000
    I can't stay long.          
I only have a few minutes.      

08:11.100 --> 08:12.300
What's wrong with the computer? 

08:12.300 --> 08:13.300
      Oh, nothing, really.      

08:13.300 --> 08:14.900
        I just can't get        
those little green letters      

08:15.000 --> 08:16.200
    to pop up on the screen.    

08:16.200 --> 08:17.700
        Well, did you try       
             booting it up?     

08:17.800 --> 08:19.100
Yeah, I did plenty of that.     

08:20.900 --> 08:23.400
Sam, you can call me stupid,    

08:23.400 --> 08:25.400
    but I think if Miss Howe    
     was still around here,     

08:25.400 --> 08:27.300
     she could take care of     
all this technical stuff.       

08:27.400 --> 08:28.600
You're stupid.                  

08:28.600 --> 08:33.100
                I said Sam could
        call me stupid, not you.

08:33.100 --> 08:35.299
          I don't know if that's
             a good idea, Woody.

08:35.299 --> 08:37.900
I said you could call           
me stupid, not my idea.         

08:38.000 --> 08:40.500
Doesn't anybody                 
listen around here?             

08:40.500 --> 08:43.299
    You don't think I don't     
     want Rebecca back here     

08:43.299 --> 08:44.400
    managing the bar?           

08:44.400 --> 08:45.900
I'd love it, man, but she       

08:45.900 --> 08:48.100
quit, she's never               
gonna come back here.           

08:48.200 --> 08:51.600
    Well, Sam, you'll never know
unless you offer her the job.   

08:51.600 --> 08:54.000
      Yeah, hey, how would      
         you guys feel          

08:54.100 --> 08:56.400
     about Rebecca managing     
    this place again?           

08:56.400 --> 08:59.100
      Well, would it raise      
    the price of beer?          

08:59.200 --> 08:59.900
        No.                     

09:00.000 --> 09:01.800
     Then what do we care?      

09:01.800 --> 09:04.100
 All right, that's a good idea. 

09:04.100 --> 09:05.500
    I'll offer her the job.     

09:05.600 --> 09:08.400
Oh, good. Did you find          
out what was wrong?             

09:08.400 --> 09:09.600
    Yeah, the disk was          
          in backwards          

09:09.700 --> 09:11.600
  and the keyboard connection   
        was loose.              

09:11.700 --> 09:14.500
      Also, you had picked it up
    and thrown it on the ground.

09:14.600 --> 09:17.000
Wow, Rebecca, you are           

09:17.000 --> 09:20.200
    so great. You've got this   
        real knack for managing.

09:20.300 --> 09:22.900
                  What, what are
                you doing... for
            the rest of the day?

09:22.900 --> 09:24.800
          What are you doing for
        the rest of the week?   

09:24.800 --> 09:26.700
I'm going to work.              

09:26.800 --> 09:27.800
You got a job?                  

09:27.800 --> 09:29.300
Yeah, didn't I tell you guys?   

09:30.300 --> 09:31.600
     Yeah, and it could turn out

09:31.700 --> 09:33.100
                 to be something
                  real exciting.

09:33.100 --> 09:35.500
Oh, wow, what're you doing?     

09:35.600 --> 09:37.400
                    Well, I'm in
        public relations now.   

09:37.400 --> 09:38.700
         Good for you.          
REBECCA:                        
Yeah.                           

09:38.700 --> 09:40.500
    I mean, it doesn't mean     
    I'll never see you guys.    

09:40.600 --> 09:42.600
    I can still come in here    
         as a customer.         

09:42.600 --> 09:45.000
 Of course, with work and all,  
      I mean, I can't stay      

09:45.000 --> 09:48.200
 for ten, 12 hours at a stretch 
         like you guys.         

09:48.300 --> 09:50.400
Well, that's okay, you could be 
    in the part-timers club.    

09:50.400 --> 09:51.900
      They sit over there.      

09:52.000 --> 09:53.900
And when you're ready to        
commit, you'll let us know.     

09:53.900 --> 09:55.800
         Yeah. Like Phil there--
        he's right on the verge.

09:59.400 --> 10:00.300
      Well, I'd better get back.

10:00.300 --> 10:01.600
            I've already been   
            gone ten minutes.   

10:01.600 --> 10:04.300
         Ten minutes--          
she'll never make the cut.      

10:05.400 --> 10:07.000
            Bye-bye.            

10:07.100 --> 10:10.100
You know, it would've been nice 
  to have her back in the bar.  

10:10.200 --> 10:11.800
 Come to think of it, you know, 

10:11.800 --> 10:14.100
  how much work would there be  
     for her really to do?      

10:14.100 --> 10:16.400
    I mean, do I really need    
        a manager?              

10:18.600 --> 10:21.300
I've got a truckload of sorghum 
    for a Sam Malone.           

10:22.800 --> 10:24.900
 I didn't say I wanted sorghum. 

10:24.900 --> 10:26.700
                 I said I wanted
                "some more gum."

10:26.700 --> 10:28.900
         God, I hate voice mail.

10:28.900 --> 10:30.400
It's not my problem. Uh...      

10:30.500 --> 10:33.100
Where do you want me            
to put this?                    

10:33.100 --> 10:34.300
            I don't know.       

10:34.300 --> 10:36.300
    What is sorghum, anyway?    

10:36.300 --> 10:37.200
      Oh, it's grain, Sam.      

10:37.200 --> 10:38.600
  It's used to feed livestock.  

10:38.600 --> 10:43.200
So, if I put it in a bowl,      
would those guys eat it?        

10:45.000 --> 10:46.800
                Are you kidding?

10:46.800 --> 10:49.500
      I was late putting out the
            Beer Nuts last night

10:49.500 --> 10:51.300
         and Mr. Peterson almost
        snapped off my thumb.   

10:52.900 --> 10:54.100
          Fill 'em up.          

11:03.600 --> 11:05.500
                 Woody, this new
             trail mix is great.

11:05.600 --> 11:07.100
             Yeah.              

11:07.100 --> 11:09.700
             Yeah, slide another
              bowl down, please.

11:09.700 --> 11:13.000
You might want to mix a raw egg 
    in there, Mr. Peterson.     

11:13.000 --> 11:15.500
Makes your coat nice and shiny. 

11:17.600 --> 11:19.000
             What?              

11:19.100 --> 11:21.700
          (laughing):           
          Oh, nothing.          

11:24.900 --> 11:27.000
      Hey, guys, listen up      
    here for a second.          

11:27.000 --> 11:29.000
    I want you to meet          
         someone here.          

11:29.000 --> 11:30.800
    It's your new manager--     
         this is Earl.          

11:30.800 --> 11:32.600
    Hey, Earl.                  
                    Hi, Earl.   

11:32.600 --> 11:34.300
  Earl used to play shortstop   
         for the Cubs.          

11:34.300 --> 11:35.900
                    All right...
                 one of us, huh?

11:36.000 --> 11:37.400
     You guys from Chicago?     

11:37.500 --> 11:39.000
    No. They're all losers.     

11:41.200 --> 11:42.300
        (sneezes)               

11:42.300 --> 11:44.200
Boy, that sounds like           

11:44.300 --> 11:46.500
a nasty cold you've             
got there, son.                 

11:46.500 --> 11:49.500
And still you're out            
there delivering the mail?      

11:49.600 --> 11:52.200
I've got a lot of               
respect for you guys.           

11:52.300 --> 11:55.300
    Sammy, give                 
    this guy a raise.           

11:55.300 --> 11:56.800
                Earl, get out   
              from behind there.

11:56.800 --> 11:57.800
        Come on, have a seat.   

11:57.800 --> 11:59.800
Oh, don't sit me down at a bar. 

11:59.800 --> 12:01.400
    I'll never get up.          
                        Ah...   

12:01.400 --> 12:03.100
        It's either that        
    or go home to the wife,     

12:03.100 --> 12:04.700
and God knows I hate to do that.

12:04.700 --> 12:06.900
Do you have the other half      
        of this amulet?         

12:12.100 --> 12:14.300
Looks like                      
you've found                    
a home here, Earl.              

12:14.400 --> 12:16.000
          Oh, well, thanks, Sam.

12:16.100 --> 12:18.800
 Why don't you find me an apron 
and I'll get started here?      

12:18.900 --> 12:21.900
Holy moly!                      
The man handles computers,      

12:21.900 --> 12:24.300
        he tends bar...         

12:24.300 --> 12:26.600
Anything you                    
need me for, son.               

12:26.700 --> 12:28.500
Whoa! Would you...              

12:28.600 --> 12:29.500
                  What? What?   

12:29.600 --> 12:31.000
...catch a look                 
at that babe there?             

12:31.000 --> 12:32.200
                  Where are you?
                  Where are you?

12:32.200 --> 12:34.800
In the poolroom,                
kind of behind that pole.       

12:34.800 --> 12:36.700
                  Whoo! Boy, you
              do have good eyes.

12:36.700 --> 12:39.200
             You sure you played
                  with the Cubs?

12:42.400 --> 12:46.100
                Well, guys, I...
             I hope I do as well
        as your last manager.   

12:46.100 --> 12:47.700
You're probably                 
going to want                   

12:47.700 --> 12:49.800
to set your sights              
a wee bit higher.               

12:49.900 --> 12:52.300
Come on, guys, guys, guys.      
Rebecca's doing great.          

12:52.300 --> 12:56.100
Our old manager moved on        
to bigger and better things.    

12:56.200 --> 13:00.200
     Nothing can hurt a car     
treated with Miracle Buff.      

13:00.200 --> 13:02.900
      Absolutely nothing.       

13:02.900 --> 13:05.100
    Watch me pour acid          
    on this car, and wipe it    

13:05.100 --> 13:06.600
        right off!              

13:08.800 --> 13:12.600
        Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!         

13:22.900 --> 13:24.500
            REBECCA:            
         That's right.          

13:24.600 --> 13:27.300
     Nothing can penetrate      
     the mirror-like luster     

13:27.300 --> 13:29.300
        of Miracle Buff.        

13:29.300 --> 13:32.900
    Not even... fire.           

13:36.700 --> 13:39.000
        (panting)               

13:40.200 --> 13:41.800
                  You people are
              just going to have

13:41.900 --> 13:43.600
             to take my word for
             it this time, okay?

13:43.700 --> 13:45.400
        Ladies and gentlemen,   

13:45.400 --> 13:46.800
  I have to take a break now,   

13:46.800 --> 13:50.100
but our next demonstration      
will be in... one minute?!      

13:53.700 --> 13:55.600
 I just get so afraid up there. 

13:55.600 --> 13:57.100
        We're afraid for you.   

13:57.200 --> 14:00.400
        But that's what makes   
      the auto show so exciting.

14:06.800 --> 14:09.400
    Hey, huh? Is this great     
to cut out from work like this? 

14:09.400 --> 14:10.400
Yeah.                           

14:10.400 --> 14:12.000
     With Earl at the bar,      
        you know,               

14:12.100 --> 14:13.600
we can stay here all day.       

14:13.600 --> 14:15.100
Oh, Sam, check it out!          
Sheepskin covers!               

14:15.100 --> 14:16.300
        What are you doing, man?

14:16.300 --> 14:18.700
              Why are you buying
         all this vinyl cleaner,

14:18.700 --> 14:20.300
                leather cleaner?
              I mean, sheepskin?

14:20.300 --> 14:21.500
                  You don't even
                     have a car.

14:21.500 --> 14:23.600
          I know, Sam,          
    but most of my furniture    

14:23.600 --> 14:27.100
    comes from the interior     
            of cars.            

14:27.100 --> 14:28.700
I've got to be careful          
when I shave                    

14:28.800 --> 14:30.800
because objects may             
be closer than they appear.     

14:33.800 --> 14:36.900
                        REBECCA:
  Ladies and gentlemen, the next
      Miracle Buff demonstration

14:37.000 --> 14:39.200
 will commence in ten seconds.  

14:39.200 --> 14:42.400
Oh, my God! Look at that.       
        That's Rebecca.         

14:42.400 --> 14:44.500
  She's working the auto show.  

14:44.500 --> 14:46.400
Oh, wow! She <i>does</i>               
have a great job.               

14:46.400 --> 14:48.500
She's Miss Miracle Buff.        

14:48.600 --> 14:49.800
SAM:                            
I don't think                   
she'd want us                   

14:49.800 --> 14:51.000
     to see her like this.      

14:51.100 --> 14:53.200
    Just keep out of sight.     

14:53.200 --> 14:56.000
         Miracle Buff,          
     the amazing discovery      

14:56.000 --> 14:58.900
that will make your car's finish
        last a lifetime.        

14:58.900 --> 15:00.500
      For safety reasons,       

15:00.600 --> 15:04.300
we can't actually simulate      
        a nuclear blast,        

15:04.400 --> 15:07.100
but we have already shown       
    that acid and fire          

15:07.100 --> 15:09.800
 are no match for Miracle Buff. 

15:09.800 --> 15:13.900
    Unlike human skin.          

15:14.000 --> 15:16.100
              Sam, I don't think
        I can keep up this pace.

15:16.100 --> 15:18.000
I'm still dizzy from being      
knocked in the face             

15:18.100 --> 15:20.200
from that airbag demonstration. 

15:20.200 --> 15:22.800
  I think I'm going to go over  
    to the RVs and lie down.    

15:22.900 --> 15:24.700
            REBECCA:            
      Now, you're probably      
        all saying              

15:24.800 --> 15:28.000
          to yourself,          
    "Hey, Miss Miracle Buff,    

15:28.000 --> 15:32.300
would the same thing apply      
      to..." Boiling tar?!      

15:32.300 --> 15:34.300
          No way! No. Forget it.

15:34.300 --> 15:36.500
                 Then you get me
                some oven mitts.

15:36.600 --> 15:40.000
     He won't even give me      
        any oven mitts.         

15:40.100 --> 15:42.400
      I am making a lousy       
    six bucks an hour.          

15:42.500 --> 15:44.100
            I mean,             
    that will not even cover    

15:44.200 --> 15:45.600
        the skin grafts!        

15:45.600 --> 15:47.800
  I'm not doing this anymore.   
          This is it!           

15:47.800 --> 15:49.100
    You're not getting paid     
        for this.               

15:49.100 --> 15:54.300
Look, buddy, I am carrying      
    a boiling bucket of tar!    

15:54.400 --> 15:56.300
             It's okay. It's all
            right. It's okay.   

15:56.400 --> 15:59.900
Oh, Sam, could this             
all be a bad dream?             

15:59.900 --> 16:02.700
        No, honey.              
     This is the auto show.     

16:08.900 --> 16:11.500
 My friends! Thanks to my buddy 
  Earl's amazing cold remedy,   

16:11.500 --> 16:13.800
    you are looking at          
 the picture of perfect health. 

16:13.800 --> 16:17.100
    Every sinus cavity          
  in my head is clear and dry.  

16:17.100 --> 16:20.400
Well, not dry, but moist enough 
    to be comfortable.          

16:20.500 --> 16:21.800
             Glad you're feeling
                 better, Cliffy.

16:21.900 --> 16:23.100
    Eh! Thank you.              

16:23.100 --> 16:25.300
                 Did this, uh...
              particular cold...

16:25.300 --> 16:27.100
              Did this start out
              with a funny taste

16:27.100 --> 16:28.500
                  up in the back
                  of your mouth?

16:28.500 --> 16:31.100
Uh-oh! The old acid             
in the adenoids.                

16:31.100 --> 16:32.200
        Scratchy throat?        

16:32.200 --> 16:33.500
Yucky coating                   
on the tongue?                  

16:33.600 --> 16:36.100
Sounds like an epidemic.        

16:36.100 --> 16:38.700
My friends, I don't want        
to be an alarmist,              

16:38.700 --> 16:40.700
but tonight--                   
if you live through it--        

16:40.800 --> 16:43.200
is going to be the worst        
night in your entire lives.     

16:45.500 --> 16:48.100
First, the cold sweats,         
the pounding headache...        

16:48.100 --> 16:49.600
                  Cliff, I don't
              want to hear this.

16:49.700 --> 16:51.100
Don't worry, Norm.              

16:51.200 --> 16:53.000
In a few hours,                 
your ears will be so clogged    

16:53.000 --> 16:54.300
you won't be able               
to hear anything.               

16:54.300 --> 16:57.700
         Look, Clavin,          
     you gave us this cold,     

16:57.800 --> 16:59.400
and I'm going to get you for it.

16:59.400 --> 17:01.200
 You're not going to know when, 
    but I'll be there.          

17:01.300 --> 17:02.800
Don't worry, Carla.             
I'll know when.                 

17:02.800 --> 17:06.000
I'll hear your liquid-filled    
lungs wheezing a mile away.     

17:09.700 --> 17:11.599
Hey, hey, everybody!            

17:11.700 --> 17:12.700
                 CARLA AND NORM:
                      Hey, Earl.

17:12.700 --> 17:16.300
Hey! Norm, do me a favor,       
        will you?               

17:16.400 --> 17:18.300
  Let me know how this tastes.  

17:22.400 --> 17:24.700
                     It's great.
                What did you do?

17:24.700 --> 17:26.900
 Well, I adjusted the pressure  
          in the kegs,          

17:27.000 --> 17:29.000
     and then I cleaned out     
         all the lines.         

17:29.000 --> 17:32.100
        Earl, how do you like   
              the sound of this?

17:32.200 --> 17:34.400
             Mrs. Earl Peterson.

17:34.400 --> 17:36.700
                        Come on.

17:36.700 --> 17:38.800
                 Think about it.
                        Come on.

17:38.800 --> 17:40.500
I don't know why you guys       

17:40.500 --> 17:43.500
are falling all over            
yourselves about this Earl.     

17:43.500 --> 17:45.700
      So he's a nice guy.       
        Big deal.               

17:45.700 --> 17:47.400
         Uh... Carla, excuse me.

17:47.400 --> 17:49.700
  I noticed you've been carrying
         your tray a little low.

17:49.800 --> 17:51.500
Are... are your shoulders tense?

17:51.500 --> 17:55.000
  Let me just... if you don't   
     mind... let me just...     

17:55.100 --> 17:58.100
Oh! Oh!                         

17:58.100 --> 18:00.300
That is the best                
I have ever felt                

18:00.300 --> 18:02.600
without ending up               
with a baby.                    

18:05.400 --> 18:08.000
It wasn't just                  
the acid, Sam.                  

18:08.100 --> 18:10.500
It was the fire,                
and the simulated hailstorm,    

18:10.600 --> 18:12.200
     and the live pigeons.      

18:12.200 --> 18:14.000
        12 times a day,         
     I rubbed and I rubbed      

18:14.000 --> 18:15.600
and I rubbed and I rubbed.      

18:15.600 --> 18:17.600
Come on, Miss Howe.             
The auto show couldn't          
have been that bad.             

18:17.700 --> 18:19.600
      Woody, I don't have       
     any fingerprints left!     

18:20.800 --> 18:22.400
Sit in here and calm down.      

18:22.400 --> 18:24.900
      Rebecca was working       
    at the auto show?           

18:25.000 --> 18:26.900
Yeah. She was                   
Miss Miracle Buff.              

18:26.900 --> 18:28.800
Don't let the fancy             
title fool you.                 

18:28.900 --> 18:32.600
She was pitching snake oil      
like a sideshow geek.           

18:36.000 --> 18:38.500
                          Woody?
                What did she do?

18:38.500 --> 18:40.100
Well, as near as I could tell,  

18:40.200 --> 18:42.200
everything but bite the head    
off a live chicken.             

18:43.100 --> 18:46.900
Of course, we got there late.   

18:46.900 --> 18:50.100
          It's an indestructible
         space-age polymer, Sam,

18:50.100 --> 18:53.100
            and it's in my hair.

18:53.100 --> 18:54.700
Why didn't you come to us?      

18:54.700 --> 18:57.000
I mean, come on. The auto show? 

18:57.000 --> 18:58.800
     Because I was ashamed,     

18:58.900 --> 19:01.800
      and I really wanted       
      to find a good job.       

19:01.800 --> 19:03.400
Oh, honey, I know, I know.      

19:09.000 --> 19:11.500
            It's just that no   
        corporation will hire me

19:11.600 --> 19:15.100
                because of my   
         involvement with Robin.

19:15.100 --> 19:17.500
I mean, it was either that or...

19:17.500 --> 19:21.100
or selling myself on the street.

19:21.100 --> 19:23.400
        All right,              
  so I made the wrong choice.   

19:23.400 --> 19:26.900
         Listen. Uh...          
      whatever, you know?       

19:27.000 --> 19:29.100
You've got a job here           
managing, if you want.          

19:29.100 --> 19:30.000
             I do?              

19:30.000 --> 19:30.800
             Yeah.              

19:30.900 --> 19:32.500
      Oh, Sam, thank you.       

19:32.500 --> 19:34.400
  I'll do a great job for you.  

19:34.400 --> 19:38.200
¶ ...jolly good fellow,         
for Earl's a jolly good fellow ¶

19:38.300 --> 19:40.200
¶ For Earl's                    
a jolly good fellow... ¶        

19:41.700 --> 19:42.700
Shoot!                          

19:42.800 --> 19:43.800
I forgot about Earl.            

19:43.800 --> 19:44.700
          Who is Earl?          

19:44.700 --> 19:47.000
A jolly good fellow.            

19:49.100 --> 19:50.500
     Oh, I know that, Sam.      

19:50.500 --> 19:52.400
     He's working here now.     

19:52.400 --> 19:54.200
                He's, uh... he's
                a real nice guy.

19:54.200 --> 19:56.000
                We all got close
            to him real fast.   

19:56.000 --> 19:58.100
              He's like a father
            figure to all of us.

19:58.100 --> 20:00.800
    Are-Are you sure you gave   
         the auto show a chance?

20:00.800 --> 20:01.600
        Sam!                    

20:01.600 --> 20:03.500
        Kid, you've got the job.

20:03.600 --> 20:05.000
        You've got the job.     
This is swell.                  

20:05.000 --> 20:06.900
      And, you know, I bet      
     I'll grow to love Earl     

20:07.000 --> 20:08.400
          just as much          
    as everybody else does.     

20:08.400 --> 20:10.300
    Hmm...                      
        So what do you want     
          me to do first?       

20:10.400 --> 20:12.200
        Fire Earl.              

20:23.900 --> 20:25.800
NORM:                           
You fired Earl!                 

20:26.700 --> 20:30.400
    Norm! Norm! Norm! Norm!     

20:30.400 --> 20:31.900
              Sam,              

20:32.000 --> 20:33.600
            did you send this   
                poor little lady

20:33.600 --> 20:35.000
            out here to fire me?

20:35.100 --> 20:35.600
              No.               

20:36.700 --> 20:39.800
    All right, I could          
    never lie to you, Earl.     

20:39.800 --> 20:42.400
  Yes. Yes. But don't you see?  

20:42.400 --> 20:44.700
        Rebecca's our friend,   
          and she needs the job,

20:44.700 --> 20:47.500
              and I can't afford
            to hire both of you.

20:47.600 --> 20:49.900
    I'm sure you can go out     
    and get a job someplace.    

20:49.900 --> 20:51.500
                 Well, of course
                     I can, Sam.

20:51.600 --> 20:53.600
             I just wish you had
              told me to my face

20:53.600 --> 20:55.500
             instead of handling
                    it this way.

20:55.600 --> 20:58.600
             I'm... I'm a little
            disappointed in you.

21:00.800 --> 21:03.400
     Please don't say that.     

21:03.400 --> 21:06.700
             I'm more than happy
                  to step aside.

21:06.700 --> 21:09.500
          I understand          
the importance of loyalty.      

21:09.500 --> 21:12.700
You know, I always believe      
that the only way               

21:12.700 --> 21:15.400
to run a business               
or a friendship                 

21:15.400 --> 21:17.200
    or, hell, a life,           

21:17.200 --> 21:21.100
    is through loyalty          
and commitment to other people. 

21:21.200 --> 21:24.300
        Gee, that's just what my
      father always used to say.

21:24.300 --> 21:27.400
        Ah. Your father         
    was right, missy.           

21:27.400 --> 21:29.800
         Hey, why don't         
      you pick up a phone       

21:29.800 --> 21:31.500
      and give him a call?      

21:37.800 --> 21:41.700
Well, so long, everybody.       

21:41.800 --> 21:44.000
Bye!                            
                      Bye, Earl!
    Good-bye!                   

21:48.700 --> 21:51.500
Well, back to work.             

21:51.600 --> 21:55.300
      Sammy, that was Earl      
 that just walked out of here!  

21:55.300 --> 21:57.000
         (all yelling)          

21:57.000 --> 22:00.500
I know, I know that, I... but I 
had to hire Rebecca back.       

22:00.500 --> 22:02.000
Come on, she's our friend.      

22:02.000 --> 22:04.000
  I can't afford both of them.  
         Don't you see?         

22:04.000 --> 22:06.400
      I mean, I had to go       
with the personal decision here.

22:06.400 --> 22:09.600
I'm sorry. I just hope          
you can live with it.           

22:09.600 --> 22:10.800
NORM:                           
Wait, wait.                     
Sam! Sam!                       

22:10.800 --> 22:12.300
         One question.          
                        What?   

22:12.400 --> 22:14.500
         Is this going          
  to raise the price of beer?   

22:14.600 --> 22:15.400
              No.               

22:15.400 --> 22:16.900
     Then what do we care?      

22:17.000 --> 22:18.700
     Welcome back, Rebecca.     

22:18.800 --> 22:21.100
          ¶ For she's           
     a jolly good fellow ¶      

22:21.100 --> 22:23.400
      ¶ For she's a jolly       
         good fellow ¶          

22:23.400 --> 22:26.500
¶ For she's a jolly             
good fellow... ¶                
  Shut up! I can't hear Daddy!
