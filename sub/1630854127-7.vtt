00:16.099 --> 00:17.392
Help me!

00:17.892 --> 00:19.352
He tried to kill me!

00:20.145 --> 00:23.189
Help me! Help me!

00:24.524 --> 00:25.650
Help!

00:39.414 --> 00:41.624
Help! Help me, please!

00:43.543 --> 00:45.045
Somebody call the police!

00:45.545 --> 00:46.755
He tried to kill me!

00:47.714 --> 00:48.673
Help me!

02:18.388 --> 02:19.931
Stay where I can see you.

02:20.473 --> 02:23.685
I'm tellin' you. This is the guy
who's killing them. God as my witness.

02:34.362 --> 02:37.407
Anything you say will
be used against you in a court of law.

02:37.490 --> 02:38.533
Fuck you!

02:40.702 --> 02:42.871
For what I did, I should be dead.

02:45.915 --> 02:49.878
What did Jeff Dahmer do?
'Cause I know he was doing something!

02:49.961 --> 02:53.298
Clear it out. Make a path! Comin' through!

03:14.277 --> 03:17.030
I knew you was up
to something, Jeff Dahmer!

03:17.113 --> 03:18.156
And I called y'all!

03:18.239 --> 03:21.534
And I told you
over and over a million times

03:21.618 --> 03:24.120
that something was going on,
and you know what you did?

03:24.204 --> 03:25.663
Y'all did nothing!

03:26.289 --> 03:27.415
Nothing!

03:27.498 --> 03:29.125
What? Y'all motherfuckers knew?

03:30.501 --> 03:32.253
-You knew?
-Sir, calm down.

03:32.337 --> 03:34.130
You knew this motherfucker
was killing people?

03:34.214 --> 03:35.256
What'd y'all find in there?

03:37.091 --> 03:38.259
Hmm?

03:38.343 --> 03:40.720
And what y'all gonna do
about this young man?

03:40.803 --> 03:43.056
You see he obviously needs
to be taken care of!

03:43.139 --> 03:45.350
Ma'am, this is police business.
Just go back inside.

03:45.433 --> 03:47.560
I called y'all for months!

03:48.353 --> 03:50.021
For months!

03:50.104 --> 03:52.232
And now you finally came?

03:53.316 --> 03:54.817
And it's too late!

03:55.693 --> 03:57.904
Y'all came too late!

03:58.404 --> 04:02.533
<i> Some neighbors here</i>
<i>complained of a stench for almost a year.</i>

04:02.617 --> 04:05.328
<i>But they never imagined</i>
<i>what might be causing it.</i>

04:05.411 --> 04:08.039
<i>Milwaukee Police were led</i>
<i>to an apartment in this building</i>

04:08.122 --> 04:11.209
<i>after they were flagged down</i>
<i>by a handcuffed man…</i>

04:18.424 --> 04:20.301
<i> Fifteen human bodies,</i>

04:20.385 --> 04:23.221
<i>including three heads</i>
<i>preserved in a refrigerator.</i>

04:29.894 --> 04:32.105
Ma'am,
you have to leave the premises.

04:32.188 --> 04:36.609
We're asking all residents to evacuate
for our investigation and their safety.

04:36.693 --> 04:38.278
Wha… What?

04:40.113 --> 04:41.948
Wait a minute.

04:42.031 --> 04:44.325
Where exactly am I supposed to go?

04:44.993 --> 04:47.036
The entire building's a crime scene.

04:47.120 --> 04:49.789
There's toxic chemicals in here
that could be a hazard.

04:49.872 --> 04:50.873
Wait.

04:53.293 --> 04:55.086
How many did you find?

04:56.379 --> 04:57.338
Bodies?

04:57.422 --> 04:59.465
<i>Come out front. Over.</i>

05:00.216 --> 05:01.342
Copy that.

05:01.426 --> 05:04.304
Ma'am, just pack your things
and vacate the building, okay?

05:05.638 --> 05:07.515
<i>On to the news desk. Ann?</i>

05:07.598 --> 05:08.808
<i>Thanks, Brian.</i>

05:08.891 --> 05:10.893
<i>In the news this morning,</i>
<i>on a serious note,</i>

05:10.977 --> 05:14.480
<i>police in Wisconsin this morning</i>
<i>are investigating a grisly discovery</i>

05:14.564 --> 05:16.149
<i>in a Milwaukee apartment.</i>

05:16.232 --> 05:18.067
<i>The discovery of pieces of bodies.</i>

05:18.151 --> 05:22.030
<i>Police found parts</i>
<i>of as many as 15 human bodies inside.</i>

05:22.113 --> 05:23.573
<i>Police were led there by a man</i>

05:23.656 --> 05:26.242
<i>who told them</i>
<i>he'd been attacked with a butcher knife.</i>

05:26.326 --> 05:29.537
<i>Police are questioning the 31-year-old man</i>
<i>who lives in the apartment.</i>

05:29.620 --> 05:31.998
<i>The Milwaukee newspapers</i>
<i>reporting the man had--</i>

05:39.130 --> 05:41.382
<i>So far, we've identified</i>
<i>11 different bodies.</i>

05:42.008 --> 05:44.510
<i>From what Dahmer's told our detectives,</i>
<i>we think there's more.</i>

05:44.594 --> 05:45.720
How many more?

05:45.803 --> 05:48.890
Not sure. Sixteen, 17, maybe.

05:48.973 --> 05:50.725
Jesus.

05:52.101 --> 05:54.020
Apparently, he killed
his first victim in Ohio.

05:55.313 --> 05:58.941
The bodies in the apartment,
have we been able to establish identities?

05:59.025 --> 06:02.403
Based on the condition of the victims,
we thought it might take a while,

06:02.487 --> 06:04.280
but Dahmer's kept more than their bodies.

06:05.448 --> 06:06.866
<i>He kept their IDs.</i>

06:07.825 --> 06:10.661
One of his victims was only 14 years old.

06:11.537 --> 06:13.956
Christ, could this case get any worse?

06:17.377 --> 06:18.419
What?

06:18.503 --> 06:22.131
So, you're saying that one of the victims
had actually managed to escape,

06:22.215 --> 06:26.969
and two of your officers
escorted him back to Dahmer's?

06:27.887 --> 06:29.138
<i>Looks that way.</i>

06:29.972 --> 06:32.850
The Laotian boy,
we're still investigating the matter,

06:32.934 --> 06:36.145
but apparently a concerned citizen
tried to intervene and save the boy,

06:36.229 --> 06:37.522
but she was ignored.

06:38.314 --> 06:39.732
Glenda Cleveland.

06:40.733 --> 06:43.236
<i>-I hesitate to ask…</i>
She's Black.

06:43.319 --> 06:44.570
<i>Goddammit!</i>

06:45.780 --> 06:48.157
<i>Are you planning</i>
<i>to discipline these two officers?</i>

06:48.866 --> 06:51.494
I'd like to finish
our internal investigation first.

06:51.577 --> 06:54.497
Can't you at least suspend them
to give the public the impression

06:54.580 --> 06:56.499
that you're doing something about this?

06:56.582 --> 06:57.917
<i>Mayor, I have to tread carefully.</i>

06:58.000 --> 06:59.794
I've been chief in Milwaukee two years,

06:59.877 --> 07:02.088
but the cops here still
consider me an outsider.

07:02.797 --> 07:04.841
The police union tends to protect its own.

07:04.924 --> 07:09.387
Okay, and I would advise you
to protect your own ass and mine

07:09.470 --> 07:13.433
before this becomes more than just
a story about a deranged serial killer.

07:14.308 --> 07:15.643
Understood.

07:15.726 --> 07:17.437
<i>Have you notified</i>
<i>the victims' families yet?</i>

07:18.980 --> 07:19.939
We're about to.

07:39.834 --> 07:42.462
-Yes?
-Afternoon. I'm Detective Kennedy.

07:42.545 --> 07:44.338
This is Detective Murphy.

07:45.339 --> 07:47.550
Are you related to Errol Lindsey?

07:47.633 --> 07:49.594
Yes. Tony's my son.

07:55.766 --> 07:59.645
Uh, hi. Uh, we're with
the Milwaukee Police Department.

07:59.729 --> 08:01.189
What's going on?

08:01.272 --> 08:02.273
Um…

08:02.356 --> 08:03.816
These men are with the police.

08:05.568 --> 08:08.446
Is he… dead?

08:12.366 --> 08:15.203
-Can we speak to your mother and father?
-Pa?

08:15.286 --> 08:17.079
-It's about Konerak?
-May we come in?

08:18.414 --> 08:19.832
Is he okay?

08:19.916 --> 08:22.585
-It's about Konerak.
-Is he okay?

08:22.668 --> 08:25.421
Mr. and Mrs. Sinthasomphone,

08:25.505 --> 08:28.716
I'm sorry to say that your son is dead.

08:28.799 --> 08:32.637
Y'all found Errol's body
with those other ones, didn't ya?

08:32.720 --> 08:35.681
It appears he was murdered
by a man named Jeffrey Dahmer.

08:35.765 --> 08:38.059
-That man molested my brother Somsack!

08:38.142 --> 08:39.727
He was supposed to be in jail!

08:39.810 --> 08:41.020
You knew about him!

08:41.103 --> 08:43.105
-Well… No, we didn't.
-No, no, we only found out--

08:43.189 --> 08:45.691
-Konerak was only 14 years old!

08:45.775 --> 08:46.817
Can we come in, ma'am?

08:46.901 --> 08:48.444
No, you may not!

08:55.660 --> 08:58.120
Glenda, can I have a word?

09:00.665 --> 09:06.003
Mr. Lively, he saw the newspaper article
where you gave an interview.

09:06.087 --> 09:09.549
I'm surprised he saw it.
They buried it on page 27.

09:12.510 --> 09:14.053
Did the article upset him?

09:14.136 --> 09:16.222
Yes. Yes, it did.

09:17.014 --> 09:22.061
This is a very conservative business
with a very conservative clientele.

09:22.144 --> 09:24.605
-And in the article…
-Mm-hmm.

09:25.147 --> 09:27.900
Well, what you said was very upsetting.

09:27.984 --> 09:30.820
Well, when
the police arrived on the scene,

09:30.903 --> 09:34.949
they believed Jeff over my daughter
and my niece who called 911.

09:35.032 --> 09:39.870
Jeff told them this child
was his 19-year-old lover,

09:39.954 --> 09:41.038
and they believed it!

09:41.122 --> 09:43.165
Even though the baby
ain't had on no clothes,

09:43.249 --> 09:48.963
couldn't speak a full sentence,
and was obviously drunk, drugged up.

09:49.046 --> 09:50.673
Baby, can you tell us your name?

09:50.756 --> 09:53.634
<i>I don't know what grown person</i>
<i>in their right mind</i>

09:53.718 --> 09:57.179
<i>could've looked at that baby</i>
<i>and not think he was in danger,</i>

09:57.263 --> 09:59.056
<i>no less a man.</i>

09:59.932 --> 10:02.310
<i>But I couldn't get that baby off my mind.</i>

10:03.311 --> 10:06.439
And I called the police over and over

10:06.522 --> 10:10.026
to… to check on his welfare
and make sure he was okay.

10:11.902 --> 10:14.363
<i>But they just told me they had it handled.</i>

10:14.447 --> 10:17.074
Mr. Lively is worried
about the press.

10:17.658 --> 10:20.620
Our clients would not like
that kind of attention.

10:21.579 --> 10:22.538
And Glenda…

10:23.497 --> 10:24.582
Yes?

10:25.458 --> 10:27.835
There have been some complaints about you

10:28.544 --> 10:31.714
from some of the other ladies
who work in your division.

10:33.215 --> 10:36.427
They see you crying sometimes
at your desk.

10:36.510 --> 10:39.597
Well, I try not to cause a scene.

10:39.680 --> 10:43.476
I… I… I do. I try.
You gotta understand that.

10:43.559 --> 10:45.102
I get up. I excuse myself.

10:45.186 --> 10:48.689
I go to the restroom for a private moment
when those feelings rise up.

10:50.900 --> 10:52.777
<i>This is becoming an HR issue.</i>

10:54.153 --> 10:57.239
And while I personally understand. I do--

10:57.323 --> 10:58.199
Do you?

11:02.995 --> 11:06.248
I'm sorry.
I am… I am so sorry. It…

11:08.334 --> 11:09.543
I just feel…

11:10.336 --> 11:13.589
I just feel the pressure of the situation.

11:16.842 --> 11:18.135
About your neighbor.

11:19.637 --> 11:21.180
Who made the zombies.

11:22.848 --> 11:24.725
Did you ever see the zombies?

11:25.810 --> 11:27.728
I'm… I'm just curious.

11:36.195 --> 11:39.115
<i>We have an update</i>
<i>for you on the case of Jeffrey Dahmer,</i>

11:39.198 --> 11:42.743
<i>the 31-year-old suspect involved</i>
<i>in a chain of grisly murders</i>

11:42.827 --> 11:44.036
<i>throughout Milwaukee.</i>

11:44.120 --> 11:46.872
<i>We are learning that Dahmer</i>
<i>would drug and asphyxiate…</i>

11:46.956 --> 11:48.749
Reverend Jackson, I have to confess,

11:49.333 --> 11:52.253
I have my reservations
about you getting involved in this case.

11:54.130 --> 11:55.923
Go on, son, speak your mind.

11:57.883 --> 11:58.843
Well…

12:00.803 --> 12:01.887
Rodney King,

12:02.972 --> 12:04.598
Latasha Harlins,

12:05.307 --> 12:06.892
the Central Park Five,

12:07.810 --> 12:11.564
I understand how those cases
fit into our civil rights agenda.

12:12.273 --> 12:14.024
But this Jeffrey Dahmer dude?

12:14.692 --> 12:17.445
A gay serial killer who eats people?

12:17.528 --> 12:21.657
Who, it appears, mostly targeted
young Black and brown men.

12:22.158 --> 12:25.119
I feel terrible for the victims
and their families, of course,

12:25.953 --> 12:28.164
but it doesn't really feel like our fight.

12:28.247 --> 12:31.751
Why? Because some of the victims
might have been gay?

12:33.544 --> 12:35.463
You told me to speak my mind, Reverend.

12:37.465 --> 12:41.218
It may not look like it,
but this Dahmer case,

12:42.386 --> 12:43.512
it <i>is </i>our fight.

12:45.514 --> 12:49.143
If you want to slay a dragon, son,
you got to attack it from all angles.

12:49.810 --> 12:53.647
And injustice is one hell of a beast.

13:03.616 --> 13:07.495
<i>I was shocked by</i>
<i>the Dahmer murders like everyone else.</i>

13:08.871 --> 13:11.499
<i>But the more I learned about the case,</i>

13:11.582 --> 13:15.002
<i>the more I realized</i>
<i>it was not just a gruesome horror show.</i>

13:15.795 --> 13:20.341
It's a metaphor for all the social ills
that plague our nation.

13:21.300 --> 13:24.345
Bad policing, underserved communities,

13:24.887 --> 13:28.140
the low value we assign
our young Black and brown men,

13:28.849 --> 13:30.684
especially if they happen to be gay.

13:31.393 --> 13:35.231
The fact that Black and brown folks
still don't have a voice

13:35.314 --> 13:38.734
and when we do speak up,
we're too often ignored.

13:39.693 --> 13:44.198
And I'm hoping
that as the leaders of this fine city,

13:45.157 --> 13:48.994
that both of you men would take swift,

13:49.078 --> 13:52.957
immediate action to address
and redress these wrongs.

13:53.874 --> 13:56.627
Reverend Jackson, we understand
your reasons for coming here,

13:56.710 --> 13:58.045
but to be honest,

13:58.921 --> 14:02.007
we're worried your presence
may complicate our own efforts.

14:02.091 --> 14:03.092
How so?

14:03.175 --> 14:06.303
The Dahmer case, I mean,
what he did to those young men

14:06.387 --> 14:08.222
and that 14-year-old boy…

14:09.974 --> 14:11.433
The whole city's on edge,

14:11.517 --> 14:16.063
and we are doing our best
to address the community's concerns.

14:16.146 --> 14:18.607
But it's a delicate situation.

14:18.691 --> 14:20.943
Our cops have been
getting rocks thrown at them.

14:21.527 --> 14:24.697
We nearly had a riot break out.
The last thing that we need right now--

14:24.780 --> 14:25.739
What?

14:25.823 --> 14:28.409
A national civil rights leader
shining a light

14:28.492 --> 14:30.870
on your police department's incompetence?

14:31.912 --> 14:35.207
For an outside agitator
to further inflame racial tensions.

14:35.291 --> 14:38.794
With all due respect, Chief,
I think we are well past that.

14:40.629 --> 14:44.216
<i>You got Black and brown folks</i>
<i>angry at the police,</i>

14:44.300 --> 14:45.509
<i>calling for justice.</i>

14:46.635 --> 14:51.557
<i>You got a city that's been traumatized</i>
<i>by these horrific murders, yes.</i>

14:51.640 --> 14:55.352
<i>But also years of poverty,</i>
<i>high unemployment,</i>

14:55.436 --> 14:58.105
<i>discrimination, police brutality.</i>

14:59.356 --> 15:04.278
Yes, Chief, I did come to Milwaukee
to be an agitator.

15:05.321 --> 15:07.448
To hold you gentlemen accountable

15:07.531 --> 15:12.369
and demand an end
to this pattern of racism and neglect.

15:12.453 --> 15:16.081
I also came here
to do whatever's in my power,

15:16.165 --> 15:18.125
as a leader, as a Christian,

15:18.208 --> 15:20.669
to help this broken community heal.

15:22.254 --> 15:24.465
So like it or not, gentlemen,

15:24.548 --> 15:26.133
you're not getting rid of me.

15:27.635 --> 15:30.930
Now, I assume you
spoke with Glenda Cleveland.

15:33.223 --> 15:34.558
Actually, no, not yet.

15:37.478 --> 15:39.647
Can you at least tell me
where I might find her?

15:43.734 --> 15:44.860
Ms. Cleveland.

15:46.654 --> 15:48.656
-Yeah?
-I'm--

15:48.739 --> 15:51.867
I know who you are, Reverend Jackson.

15:51.951 --> 15:54.370
I voted for you. Twice.

15:56.205 --> 15:57.039
May I come in?

15:57.706 --> 15:58.540
Huh? Yeah.

15:59.583 --> 16:01.919
Uh, yes. Yes, yes.

16:02.878 --> 16:06.340
<i>So I hear</i>
<i>you're a data entry clerk.</i>

16:06.966 --> 16:08.842
Yes, that is right, Reverend.

16:08.926 --> 16:12.596
I been doing it
since my daughter Sandra was a baby.

16:12.680 --> 16:14.348
How old is Sandra?

16:14.431 --> 16:16.225
-Just turned 18.
-Mm.

16:16.308 --> 16:20.062
It's crazy 'cause I was that age
when I had her.

16:20.145 --> 16:22.189
My mama had me at 16.

16:22.272 --> 16:23.565
In Greenville, right?

16:24.692 --> 16:27.111
I told you I voted for you twice.

16:27.736 --> 16:31.407
You remind me of my mother.
Strong, resilient.

16:33.200 --> 16:35.911
Now, I know a Southern girl
when I hear one.

16:36.453 --> 16:37.830
Where are you from originally?

16:38.414 --> 16:39.873
-Mississippi.
-Mm-hmm.

16:39.957 --> 16:42.918
A little farming town
called Carthage,

16:43.627 --> 16:45.713
but as good as it was,

16:45.796 --> 16:48.048
I knew I wanted better for Sandra.

16:48.549 --> 16:53.012
So, after I had her,
we moved to Milwaukee in '73.

16:53.679 --> 16:56.306
Been just the two of us here ever since.

16:58.267 --> 16:59.309
Mmm.

17:01.270 --> 17:05.274
Lord knows it ain't always been easy.

17:07.526 --> 17:09.153
I read the interview.

17:10.404 --> 17:12.656
How you tried to save that Laotian boy.

17:12.740 --> 17:14.366
It ain't right, Reverend.

17:15.117 --> 17:18.328
And, you know, the police
still ain't called to talk to me.

17:18.412 --> 17:20.122
I'm aware. It's inexcusable.

17:20.205 --> 17:23.250
Here I am,
being pestered by reporters from France.

17:23.333 --> 17:24.835
Paris, France!

17:24.918 --> 17:29.339
And the cops right here in Milwaukee
ain't interested in what I got to say.

17:29.840 --> 17:33.260
It's like…
It's like our people don't count.

17:33.343 --> 17:38.348
No matter what we do
or how loud we shout, it…

17:40.559 --> 17:41.977
They never listen.

17:45.689 --> 17:47.066
I'll listen.

18:00.621 --> 18:01.455
Well,

18:02.790 --> 18:05.084
<i>after the Konerak incident,</i>

18:05.167 --> 18:08.378
<i>things with Jeff got really bad.</i>

18:42.496 --> 18:44.123
Glenda, hey.

18:44.206 --> 18:45.582
Jeff, sorry to bother you,

18:45.666 --> 18:48.293
but there's a smell
coming from your apartment.

18:49.378 --> 18:50.212
A smell?

18:50.295 --> 18:54.133
A stench came through the vent
so strong, I almost threw up.

18:56.927 --> 18:57.970
Oh…

18:59.596 --> 19:00.639
I'm sorry.

19:02.891 --> 19:04.560
It might've been the barbecue.

19:05.185 --> 19:07.354
I was trying out a new way to cook it.

19:07.980 --> 19:10.315
I guess I let the meat sit out too long.

19:15.988 --> 19:17.739
You can smell it through your vent?

19:18.657 --> 19:20.534
Like it was in the next room.

19:22.619 --> 19:23.662
Hmm.

19:27.791 --> 19:28.792
Well…

19:31.170 --> 19:33.589
I promise I'll throw it out first thing,

19:33.672 --> 19:35.799
and I won't cook it like that again.

19:35.883 --> 19:38.302
-I really am sorry. Good night.
-Wait, Jeff, is every--

19:58.363 --> 20:00.073
-Can I take those?
-Get back!

20:00.157 --> 20:02.576
Oh, I'm sorry.
I… I didn't mean to scare you.

20:02.659 --> 20:05.078
I'm Dean. I just moved in, 308.

20:06.872 --> 20:08.916
Mm. Glenda, 215.

20:09.750 --> 20:10.959
Sorry I snapped on you.

20:11.043 --> 20:13.712
You just… You gotta be careful
in this neighborhood.

20:14.546 --> 20:17.216
Well, I'm a good guy. Scout's honor.

20:17.925 --> 20:19.384
Um… May I?

20:20.010 --> 20:21.803
-Okay.
-Okay.

20:23.263 --> 20:26.642
And don't leave your door unlocked.
We've had a string of robberies lately.

20:27.142 --> 20:30.395
Mostly addicts looking
to score money for their next fix.

20:30.479 --> 20:32.022
This crack is out of control.

20:32.856 --> 20:36.068
Most of the people in this building
are good and decent.

20:36.151 --> 20:39.905
Now, you do got a few shady characters
that you gotta look out for.

20:39.988 --> 20:43.575
Well, I'll keep my eyes open.
Thanks, Glenda. You have a good one.

20:43.659 --> 20:44.701
You too, Dean.

20:47.246 --> 20:49.581
Hey! You're the new guy, right?

20:50.123 --> 20:51.333
Yeah, I'm Dean.

20:52.459 --> 20:53.543
Jeff.

20:54.044 --> 20:55.045
Hey, Jeff.

20:57.256 --> 20:58.465
I've seen you around.

20:58.548 --> 21:00.550
Have you, now?

21:01.718 --> 21:05.138
So, Dean,
what kind of stuff you into?

21:07.432 --> 21:09.643
Um, well…

21:09.726 --> 21:11.812
I'm into building monster models.

21:13.480 --> 21:14.898
Monster models?

21:16.275 --> 21:17.359
That's a thing?

21:17.442 --> 21:19.319
Cool.

21:19.403 --> 21:21.029
Mm.

21:23.490 --> 21:27.619
Well, um, maybe I could bring
some brewskis by your place,

21:27.703 --> 21:31.456
and we could, uh, build one together.

21:32.958 --> 21:34.126
Brewskis?

21:35.419 --> 21:36.628
A six-pack.

21:36.712 --> 21:40.173
Sure. Yeah, um…
Yeah, I'm down.

21:40.924 --> 21:42.217
308.

21:42.301 --> 21:45.095
-Let me get your phone number.
-Sure.

22:27.554 --> 22:29.056
-Hey.
-Hey.

22:29.139 --> 22:33.393
So, uh, I was thinking about
grabbing a beer and a slice over at Sal's,

22:33.477 --> 22:35.896
if you, um, care to join.

22:36.480 --> 22:38.482
Um…

22:41.068 --> 22:44.446
Unless you'd rather stay here
with Frankenstein.

22:46.073 --> 22:48.992
He can wait. Let me get my keys and shit.

22:49.493 --> 22:50.786
-Sure.
-Okay.

23:07.219 --> 23:08.178
<i>A P.</i>

23:22.234 --> 23:24.403
No! No!

23:25.695 --> 23:26.905
No!

23:39.126 --> 23:41.420
It wasn't my imagination.

23:41.503 --> 23:43.880
I definitely heard somebody screaming,

23:43.964 --> 23:46.258
and it was coming
from Jeff Dahmer's apartment.

23:46.800 --> 23:48.718
<i>What do you</i>
<i>want me to do, Ms. Cleveland?</i>

23:48.802 --> 23:51.638
Your job! It's my fourth time calling.

23:51.721 --> 23:54.641
I want you to go over there
and see what the hell he's up to.

23:54.724 --> 23:57.894
I am telling you,
between the noises and the smells,

23:57.978 --> 23:59.062
something ain't right!

23:59.563 --> 24:02.816
<i>I can give him a warning</i>
<i>about the noise complaint and the smells,</i>

24:03.316 --> 24:05.068
<i>but Mr. Dahmer's a good tenant.</i>

24:06.278 --> 24:09.656
Yeah, I… I called,
and I complained about him before.

24:09.739 --> 24:14.161
I think I spoke with an Officer Baznorak
or Bouziak or…

24:14.244 --> 24:16.246
<i>Yes, I see</i>
<i>a record of the conversation.</i>

24:16.329 --> 24:17.789
<i>So what's the issue, ma'am?</i>

24:18.373 --> 24:22.419
Okay, well, a few minutes ago, I heard
screaming coming from his apartment.

24:22.502 --> 24:24.254
<i>Screaming? Like an argument?</i>

24:24.337 --> 24:27.090
No, like somebody in pain.

24:27.174 --> 24:28.467
<i>Do you still hear it?</i>

24:30.635 --> 24:32.721
No, it stopped.

24:32.804 --> 24:36.099
But, Officer, can you please just send
somebody out here to check it out?

24:36.183 --> 24:39.519
<i>I can send a unit</i>
<i>to stop by his place tomorrow.</i>

24:39.603 --> 24:40.687
Tomorrow?

24:41.438 --> 24:44.774
Sir, tomorrow could be too late.

24:45.901 --> 24:46.943
<i>I'm sorry, ma'am.</i>

24:47.027 --> 24:49.654
<i>Unless it's an active situation,</i>
<i>that's the best I can do.</i>

24:49.738 --> 24:52.324
<i> Whenever I call y'all,</i>
<i>you say the same thing.</i>

24:52.407 --> 24:55.827
<i>"Oh, I'm gonna send somebody tomorrow!"</i>
<i>And nobody ever shows!</i>

24:56.369 --> 24:59.206
<i>Is there anything else</i>
<i>I can help you with, ma'am?</i>

24:59.289 --> 25:01.333
-<i>Thank you for your time.</i>

25:06.087 --> 25:08.298
-Ms. Cleveland.
We need to talk.

25:09.591 --> 25:10.800
<i>Building manager.</i>

25:12.344 --> 25:13.803
Okay, see?

25:13.887 --> 25:16.848
This letter is postmarked two weeks ago.

25:16.932 --> 25:19.392
That's around the time
I saw him talking to Jeff.

25:19.476 --> 25:21.520
He ain't picked up his mail since.

25:22.479 --> 25:23.605
Mr. Vaughn?

25:25.899 --> 25:28.693
We comin' to drop off your mail, Dean.

25:30.445 --> 25:32.864
See? Open the door.

25:32.948 --> 25:36.618
Glenda, the guy's not here.
I can't just let you into his apartment.

25:38.662 --> 25:40.247
<i>Take a good whiff.</i>

25:40.330 --> 25:41.790
Does that smell right to you?

25:41.873 --> 25:43.750
And you didn't cook
anything strange?

25:43.833 --> 25:47.045
No, I'm telling you, it's next door.

25:47.128 --> 25:48.964
It's coming from this vent.

25:53.134 --> 25:54.010
Ugh.

25:54.594 --> 25:56.263
Yeah, okay.

25:56.346 --> 25:58.557
He keeps making excuses.

25:58.640 --> 26:00.517
"Oh, it's the meat that went bad,"

26:00.600 --> 26:01.851
and then nothing happens.

26:01.935 --> 26:04.479
And then I complain,
and nobody does anything.

26:04.563 --> 26:07.357
And I know
I'm not the only one complaining, sir!

26:07.440 --> 26:09.234
Yes, yes, I know. I was going to--

26:09.317 --> 26:11.861
Pamela Bass,
she complained about the smell.

26:11.945 --> 26:14.447
Pat from across the hall,
she complained to you,

26:14.531 --> 26:16.908
and there ain't nobody listening to us.

26:17.534 --> 26:19.119
It's gotten so bad

26:19.202 --> 26:22.998
that me and my daughter
can't stand to sleep in our own home.

26:23.623 --> 26:27.711
Smells so bad most nights,
she goes and stays at her boyfriend's.

26:27.794 --> 26:31.464
Right now I got the fan going
and the window open,

26:31.548 --> 26:33.967
and I still can barely stand
to be in here.

26:34.050 --> 26:36.136
So I am asking you,

26:36.219 --> 26:37.554
Mr. Princewill,

26:38.138 --> 26:40.223
to please evict him.

26:56.948 --> 26:58.408
-Mr. Dahmer…

26:59.534 --> 27:00.827
Uh…

27:00.910 --> 27:04.414
you know, you've been a good tenant,
you pay your rent on time--

27:04.497 --> 27:05.707
Sorry, what?

27:06.207 --> 27:08.084
Could you just step outside, please?

27:17.093 --> 27:18.136
Uh…

27:19.512 --> 27:21.431
I'm sorry, but I gotta give you this.

27:27.395 --> 27:28.396
Okay.

27:28.480 --> 27:31.399
It's an eviction notice. I'm sorry.

27:32.484 --> 27:33.485
What?

27:36.029 --> 27:37.364
What are you talking about?

27:37.447 --> 27:40.909
No, no, come on.

27:40.992 --> 27:44.496
It's the smell, Jeff.
I keep getting complaints.

27:45.789 --> 27:48.041
Well, that's why I got a cleaning crew in!

27:48.124 --> 27:49.959
Cost me $49.

27:50.043 --> 27:53.588
Well, okay, but it doesn't matter.

27:54.673 --> 27:57.509
You have 30 days. Okay? I'm sorry.

28:01.388 --> 28:05.225
Come on, man.
You know I just got fired today.

28:06.267 --> 28:07.769
I'm sorry, Jeff.

28:07.852 --> 28:09.562
People have been complaining.

28:09.646 --> 28:11.981
You're not the only person
I've got to look out for.

28:12.065 --> 28:13.024
Fuck!

28:16.820 --> 28:20.907
Hey, Sopa. Look, I'm sorry. I just, like…

28:20.990 --> 28:23.451
I never meant
to cause any trouble. I just--

28:23.535 --> 28:24.786
I'm sorry, Jeff.

28:25.912 --> 28:26.913
I really am.

28:40.677 --> 28:42.512
It was Glenda, wasn't it?

28:43.221 --> 28:45.056
She's the one who complained!

28:45.598 --> 28:46.766
I'm sorry, Jeff.

29:06.327 --> 29:07.328
Hey, Glenda.

29:08.997 --> 29:10.206
Hi.

29:10.290 --> 29:15.086
So listen, I just want to say
I'm really sorry. Okay?

29:15.170 --> 29:17.922
And if you take back the complaint,

29:18.631 --> 29:21.342
I promise I won't cook anymore.

29:21.426 --> 29:24.596
No, Jeff. It's done.

29:24.679 --> 29:25.764
All right?

29:25.847 --> 29:27.599
Wait, hold on. Hold on. Hold on.

29:27.682 --> 29:30.810
Can I just…
Can I come inside just for a sec?

29:31.394 --> 29:32.270
Why?

29:32.353 --> 29:35.815
Because I got a cleaning crew in today
that cost me $49,

29:35.899 --> 29:38.276
which I don't have
'cause I just got fired.

29:39.444 --> 29:42.739
So, I just wanted to see
if I was still stinking up your place.

29:43.865 --> 29:44.866
Okay?

29:50.997 --> 29:52.040
Okay.

30:15.104 --> 30:16.105
See?

30:17.023 --> 30:18.149
Smells nice.

30:19.317 --> 30:20.693
I don't smell nothing.

30:26.366 --> 30:27.575
Is your daughter here?

30:30.620 --> 30:31.621
What is that?

30:35.250 --> 30:36.501
That's your present.

30:39.170 --> 30:40.630
What is it?

30:51.349 --> 30:54.102
Are you gonna sit down,
or are you just gonna stand there?

30:55.311 --> 30:56.396
Like, what?

30:57.897 --> 30:58.982
You're scared of me.

30:59.065 --> 31:01.526
I am not scared of you.

31:02.110 --> 31:03.736
Well, come on. Sit down then.

31:03.820 --> 31:06.698
Jeez. I got you something.

31:08.074 --> 31:11.286
I'll sit down with you.
But it ain't gonna change nothing.

31:11.786 --> 31:14.789
You're getting evicted,
and it ain't my problem.

31:17.458 --> 31:19.085
I know, 'kay?

31:20.712 --> 31:22.547
I'm just trying to make peace here.

31:23.256 --> 31:24.424
Say I'm sorry.

31:30.680 --> 31:32.640
So you gonna open your gift?

31:56.873 --> 31:58.166
It's a sandwich.

32:02.462 --> 32:04.881
Thank you. I'll eat it later.

32:05.506 --> 32:08.301
No. Eat it now.

32:10.136 --> 32:11.638
I used to be a butcher.

32:12.263 --> 32:14.098
I made that just for you.

32:15.475 --> 32:16.392
Go ahead.

32:18.353 --> 32:19.854
I don't know what's in that.

32:20.355 --> 32:21.522
It's just meat.

32:24.859 --> 32:25.944
What kind of meat?

32:27.695 --> 32:28.863
It's like a, uh…

32:30.573 --> 32:31.699
pulled pork.

32:36.955 --> 32:38.247
I'm not eating that.

32:40.041 --> 32:40.917
Why?

32:42.251 --> 32:43.586
Are you a vegetarian?

32:43.670 --> 32:46.130
No, I'm not a vegetarian,

32:46.714 --> 32:49.425
but I'm not eating a sandwich
that my neighbor made

32:49.509 --> 32:52.512
when his apartment been smelling
like a dead raccoon's ass,

32:52.595 --> 32:55.306
stinking up my house
since the day he moved in.

32:57.433 --> 32:58.393
Okay.

33:02.271 --> 33:03.147
Fine.

33:06.943 --> 33:08.903
Try to do a nice thing, you know?

33:13.533 --> 33:15.076
You're just like my mom.

33:16.536 --> 33:17.829
My grandma too.

33:19.330 --> 33:21.874
Telling on me
when I ain't done nothing wrong.

33:23.459 --> 33:25.336
I ain't your mama, Jeff.

33:26.713 --> 33:28.131
Take back the complaint.

33:28.756 --> 33:30.633
I told you, it's done.

33:30.717 --> 33:33.428
No, it isn't.
It doesn't even smell in here.

33:34.762 --> 33:36.347
Take back the complaint.

33:37.098 --> 33:38.683
I made you a sandwich.

33:41.060 --> 33:43.187
What do you do in there? Huh?

33:44.689 --> 33:46.607
-Where?
-In that damn apartment.

33:46.691 --> 33:50.945
The smells, all… all the power tools
going all hours of the night.

33:52.822 --> 33:54.657
I'm just building something.

33:57.035 --> 33:58.661
Well, what about the screaming?

33:59.787 --> 34:00.913
What screaming?

34:01.748 --> 34:04.500
I hear screaming
coming from your apartment.

34:07.462 --> 34:08.713
Mm.

34:08.796 --> 34:10.840
Sometimes I have nightmares.

34:13.051 --> 34:14.886
What about that little Asian boy?

34:15.595 --> 34:17.972
I don't know.

34:19.474 --> 34:20.516
We broke up.

34:21.017 --> 34:22.769
And what about Dean Vaughn?

34:22.852 --> 34:26.564
You was talking to him in the hallway,
then I never saw him after that.

34:33.404 --> 34:34.447
Tell you what,

34:35.281 --> 34:36.949
you tell me where he is,

34:38.534 --> 34:40.203
I'll take back the complaint.

34:46.250 --> 34:47.585
I don't know where he went.

34:50.880 --> 34:52.215
All right then.

34:52.298 --> 34:53.633
You're movin' out.

34:56.260 --> 34:58.387
Eat the sandwich. I made it for you.

35:00.473 --> 35:01.766
I'll eat it later.

35:01.849 --> 35:04.936
I want to see you try it.
See if you like it.

35:08.731 --> 35:10.191
Get out of my apartment.

35:13.945 --> 35:14.946
Eat it.

35:17.990 --> 35:19.534
Get outta my house.

35:26.374 --> 35:27.959
You better open up!

35:55.361 --> 35:56.404
Okay.

36:23.139 --> 36:24.473
<i> All right. Here we go.</i>

36:24.974 --> 36:26.809
<i>Top seven answers are on the board.</i>

36:26.893 --> 36:28.769
<i>We asked 100 married women…</i>

36:30.563 --> 36:31.564
Relax.

36:31.647 --> 36:35.067
I know. I'm just saying,
I got a wife and two kids, okay?

36:35.151 --> 36:36.861
Oh, that's not a big deal.

36:37.653 --> 36:40.406
It's just some photos,
you know? Artsy stuff.

36:41.574 --> 36:42.950
It ain't gonna take long.

36:43.701 --> 36:45.494
Besides, it's 100 bucks.

36:48.664 --> 36:50.416
-No!

36:51.626 --> 36:52.501
Ow!

37:00.343 --> 37:02.595
-No…
-Hey, hey…

37:03.387 --> 37:05.223
Stop! No! It hurts!

37:24.533 --> 37:25.576
<i>911.</i>

37:25.660 --> 37:27.370
Hello, this is Glenda Cleveland.

37:27.453 --> 37:30.706
Can you send an officer
to the Oxford Apartments?

37:30.831 --> 37:32.124
<i>What's the emergency?</i>

37:32.708 --> 37:36.587
Well, I… I think it's a fight
going on next door,

37:36.671 --> 37:40.591
and somebody…
somebody is either being hurt or killed.

37:40.675 --> 37:41.759
<i>Can you go make sure?</i>

37:41.842 --> 37:44.720
What? What? No, I can't!

37:44.804 --> 37:48.432
I said I think somebody is being killed.
I ain't going next door!

37:48.516 --> 37:49.684
<i>We'll send a car over.</i>

37:49.767 --> 37:52.937
Wait. You're not even going
to ask me the apartment number?

37:53.020 --> 37:55.022
<i>Ma'am, I said we'd send somebody.</i>

37:55.106 --> 37:59.318
Y'all always say you gonna send somebody,
and nobody ever shows!

37:59.402 --> 38:01.779
I done called y'all like 50 times!

38:01.862 --> 38:04.031
<i>-I need you to lower your voice, okay?</i>

38:04.115 --> 38:05.783
<i>If you keep calling us all the time,</i>

38:05.866 --> 38:07.827
<i>how are we gonna know</i>
<i>when it's an emergency?</i>

38:07.910 --> 38:09.537
<i>911 is a resource, okay?</i>

38:09.620 --> 38:14.000
I am saying somebody is being killed!

38:14.083 --> 38:15.459
Do you get that?

39:19.357 --> 39:20.608
Please…

40:01.774 --> 40:03.651
You knew he was a monster.

40:10.116 --> 40:11.325
I knew.

40:13.411 --> 40:15.079
But nobody heard me.

40:18.457 --> 40:19.750
I hear you, Glenda.

40:21.460 --> 40:22.545
I hear you,

40:23.712 --> 40:25.714
and finally others have too.

40:26.549 --> 40:30.636
Tomorrow, Chief Arreola's
suspending the two officers

40:30.719 --> 40:32.930
who ignored you about the boy.

40:33.681 --> 40:34.890
I'll be honest.

40:34.974 --> 40:37.435
It's just the first step in a marathon.

40:37.518 --> 40:40.938
It's nearly impossible
to hold cops accountable,

40:41.021 --> 40:44.775
but this first step wouldn't have happened
without you, Glenda.

40:45.693 --> 40:48.571
Your voice is gonna make a difference.

40:53.909 --> 40:55.453
Oh.

40:56.162 --> 40:58.414
-Let it out, now.

41:00.458 --> 41:01.417
Yeah.
