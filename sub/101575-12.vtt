Since this is
a security situation,

18:09.392 --> 18:12.134
the president has authorized me
to negotiate with you

18:12.178 --> 18:14.135
for the release of Discovery
and its crew.

18:14.180 --> 18:15.615
Is that satisfactory to you?

18:17.748 --> 18:21.622

18:26.757 --> 18:29.846
you have permission
to respond with force.

-I'm not dying in here
because they're bored.

would really like that.

-She's not with Dr. Culber
and the captain?
-They're still in the nebula.

19:59.849 --> 20:02.330
Dr. Culber said they wouldn't
survive past four hours.

20:02.375 --> 20:04.550
Adira took radiation tablets.

20:04.594 --> 20:06.856
Wait, Adira's down there, too?

20:14.604 --> 20:15.865
It leads to a maintenance shaft.

are gonna start barricading

20:23.917 --> 20:26.660
And why is he staring at me
so intently?

20:26.702 --> 20:28.965
VANCE:
It's de rigueur
during negotiations

20:29.009 --> 20:31.230
to use a biometric
lie detector system.

20:31.272 --> 20:33.623
Even among allies.

20:33.666 --> 20:35.277
Where's the fun in that?

20:35.320 --> 20:38.148
Nobody seemed to like it when
a red light would just go off,

20:38.192 --> 20:39.715
so we gave it a face.

20:39.759 --> 20:41.587
Hmm.

20:41.631 --> 20:43.502
A human face, of course.

20:43.546 --> 20:44.373
Is that a problem?

20:44.416 --> 20:46.201
I'll get over it.

20:46.244 --> 20:49.160
I certainly do not intend
to lie.

20:49.203 --> 20:51.205
She does not.

20:52.250 --> 20:54.991
Still, it's hard to begin
a productive conversation

20:55.036 --> 20:56.777
when I haven't been able
to speak

20:56.819 --> 20:58.605
to the officers on board
my ship.

21:00.084 --> 21:02.478
-Um, lie detector thingy...
-Eli.

21:03.566 --> 21:05.525

21:05.567 --> 21:06.961

21:07.003 --> 21:09.268
the bridge crew
of the Discoveryare safe,

21:09.310 --> 21:12.488
and my crew have been given
orders not to harm them.

21:12.531 --> 21:17.144
Aside from a few scratches
and bruised egos,

21:17.188 --> 21:19.103
everyone is fine.

21:20.496 --> 21:21.758
Bruised egos.

21:21.801 --> 21:24.500
Well...
[chuckles]

21:24.544 --> 21:26.894
it was so easy to take the ship,

21:26.936 --> 21:29.330
I almost thought
that it was a trap at first.

21:29.375 --> 21:31.594
Then I realized
Captain Saru wasn't on board,

21:31.637 --> 21:33.640
just an ensign with the conn.

21:35.031 --> 21:37.383
Did you send Saru to Kaminar?

21:37.425 --> 21:39.427
You said you wanted to talk.
Let's talk.

21:39.471 --> 21:40.951
What do you want?

21:47.131 --> 21:49.394
I want peace.

21:51.614 --> 21:55.749
I want the Emerald Chain
to unite with the Federation.

21:59.404 --> 22:02.407
Well, you're gonna have
to expand on that one.

22:03.712 --> 22:05.540
Every empire falls.

22:05.585 --> 22:07.673
It would be foolish to think
that we can remain

22:07.717 --> 22:10.502
where we once were
when we're out of dilithium.

22:10.546 --> 22:13.419
I'm sure that Ryn has already
told you of our scarcity.

22:13.461 --> 22:15.334
He has.

22:15.376 --> 22:18.031
You have a spore drive
that you cannot replicate.

22:18.075 --> 22:20.382
I have the most well-funded
scientific institutions

22:20.425 --> 22:23.037
in the known galaxy.

22:23.079 --> 22:25.692
There is a deal to be made here.

22:25.734 --> 22:28.607
You already have Discovery
under your control.

22:28.651 --> 22:30.913
Why bring us into it at all?

22:30.958 --> 22:32.654
Because the Federation,

22:32.699 --> 22:34.656
despite its failures
since the Burn,

22:34.701 --> 22:36.876
is still a symbol of hope.

22:36.920 --> 22:40.096
The Chain, despite our efforts
and our advances,

22:40.141 --> 22:42.883
has never experienced
such privilege.

22:42.925 --> 22:45.885
If we combine
the best of what we are...

22:47.626 --> 22:49.977
You really think
this could work?

22:50.019 --> 22:52.458
You're a chain of planets.

22:52.500 --> 22:55.461
We are a federation
of mercantile exchanges.

22:55.503 --> 22:58.855
We need to focus on doing what
is for the good of our people.

22:58.898 --> 23:02.903
At the end of the day,
they are what this is all about.

23:07.951 --> 23:09.952
You're proposing...

23:09.997 --> 23:12.433
a new Federation.

23:13.479 --> 23:15.611

Yeah.

someone appropriate.

38:06.458 --> 38:08.764
A well-respected scientist,
perhaps.

38:09.896 --> 38:12.550
And that person
won't just be a proxy for you?

38:12.594 --> 38:13.856
Of course not.

38:20.340 --> 38:22.777
For this armistice
to be worth anything,

38:22.822 --> 38:26.347
then the person
representing the Chain

38:26.391 --> 38:28.349
has to be proven credible.

38:28.393 --> 38:30.394
And the only way that
that can happen

38:30.438 --> 38:33.048
is if he or she functions

38:33.092 --> 38:35.356

forget that.
