10:14.831 --> 10:15.919
Eh.

10:15.963 --> 10:18.269
-[shouting] No!

10:26.930 --> 10:28.889
The curse has been the broken.

10:28.932 --> 10:30.891
-[all cheering]
-Yes!

10:30.934 --> 10:32.501
Thank you, Robin.

10:32.544 --> 10:34.677
Today, we learned from you
the importance

10:34.721 --> 10:37.549
of not falling prey
to the obsessive collecting.

10:37.593 --> 10:38.725
Oh, you're welcome.

10:38.768 --> 10:41.031
I'm just glad
to have the team back.
