02:32.780 --> 02:35.660
Hey, hey! Hello, mate.

02:35.860 --> 02:37.500
- Oh, it's good to see you.
- You too.

02:37.780 --> 02:38.820
- How are you?
- Great.

02:39.060 --> 02:41.420
Luke, this is my girlfriend, Suzie.
Suzie, Luke.

02:41.700 --> 02:44.660
- Hi. It's so nice to meet you.
- And you know my sister Kate.

02:45.020 --> 02:46.900
- Kate.
- Luke.

02:48.060 --> 02:51.300
- Looking good.
- Thanks. I'll take that.

02:51.660 --> 02:53.740
- Thank you.
- Let's go.

03:01.460 --> 03:04.220
- Wow, you really bought a car?
- No.

03:04.580 --> 03:07.100
After our sail, I've gotta deliver
the boat to Indonesia,

03:07.420 --> 03:09.060
and the guy who's crewing for me
owns this.

03:09.340 --> 03:12.860
- We're not keeping you from delivering?
- No, it's all good.

03:13.220 --> 03:16.060
I can't believe you get to sail around
the world delivering boats for a living.

03:16.300 --> 03:18.020
How fantastic.

03:32.380 --> 03:34.100
Go introduce yourselves to Wazza.

03:34.380 --> 03:36.340
The scruffy-looking one
fishing off a yacht.

03:36.660 --> 03:37.580
- Cool.
- Great.

03:37.780 --> 03:39.140
See you soon.

03:41.540 --> 03:43.140
So how have you been?

03:43.380 --> 03:45.340
Good. Good. You?

03:45.620 --> 03:48.380
Yeah, good. I'm going to get
some spark plugs. You wanna come?

03:48.700 --> 03:50.780
Sure.

03:53.340 --> 03:54.500
- Shane.
- Hey.

03:54.700 --> 03:57.460
- Is Lou here?
- Yeah, he's just out the back.

04:00.060 --> 04:02.100
- Hey, Lou.
- Yeah, out here!

04:07.820 --> 04:09.620
- It's pretty impressive.
- Yeah.

04:09.900 --> 04:12.500
That's a mako, tiger, hammerhead.

04:12.780 --> 04:14.420
And that one's a white pointer.

04:16.019 --> 04:16.980
Where'd you get these?

04:17.180 --> 04:18.940
- Out there.
- Here?

04:19.140 --> 04:21.220
Yeah. Strange about
the white pointer, though.

04:21.540 --> 04:24.140
People reckon
they don't usually come this far north.

04:24.420 --> 04:25.660
Don't worry. What do they say?

04:25.900 --> 04:29.420
You're more likely to die from
a bee sting than get killed by a shark.

04:34.740 --> 04:36.060
- Wazza.
- Hey.

04:36.300 --> 04:37.940
- Kate. Kate, Warren.
- Hi.

04:38.220 --> 04:39.420
- Hi.
- How you going?

04:39.660 --> 04:41.460
- Good.
- Welcome aboard.

04:42.420 --> 04:44.700
- It's not bad.
- She's a bit scruffy, but she'll do.

04:45.020 --> 04:46.940
I'll show you where you're sleeping.

04:53.100 --> 04:54.580
This brings back memories.

04:55.940 --> 05:00.140
- This is yours.
- Hey, so... I bought you something.

05:03.460 --> 05:05.700
I wonder what this could be?

05:08.900 --> 05:10.780
Thank you.

05:16.500 --> 05:17.980
I really miss you.

05:21.700 --> 05:23.460
- Sorry.
- It's OK.

05:23.700 --> 05:27.420
- Is there someone else?
- No, there's nobody else. It's just...

05:27.740 --> 05:29.460
You wanted a break
and now you're back.

05:29.700 --> 05:32.220
Matt really wanted me to come,
and a holiday sounded like a good idea.

05:32.500 --> 05:34.700
So that's what this is,
it's just a holiday?

05:34.980 --> 05:37.340
Yeah, yeah, I'm here for a holiday.

05:37.620 --> 05:40.100
OK. Good.

05:41.620 --> 05:44.220
I've gotta go up.
Wanna catch the outgoing tide.

05:45.620 --> 05:47.500
OK.

05:54.020 --> 05:56.140
Oh, wow. Did you just catch that?

05:56.420 --> 05:58.500
Yep. These waters are full of 'em.

05:58.780 --> 06:01.380
- Cool.
- You in from Sydney?

06:01.660 --> 06:04.340
Yeah, my brother and his girlfriend
are here from London.

06:04.620 --> 06:06.100
And you're crewing with Luke
to Indonesia?

06:06.340 --> 06:08.380
- Yeah.
- Have you crewed with him before?

06:08.660 --> 06:12.020
No. No, this is the first time.
I usually work the fishing boats.

06:12.340 --> 06:14.260
Thought I'd try something different.

06:15.180 --> 06:17.940
- You've crewed with him, haven't you?
- How do you know that?

06:18.260 --> 06:21.340
- He talks a bit about you.
- Oh.

06:21.660 --> 06:24.500
Yeah, yeah, we sailed
the Mediterranean together.

06:25.300 --> 06:27.580
Whoa! Looks like we're off.

06:34.820 --> 06:36.180
So where are we heading?

06:36.420 --> 06:39.260
Cygnet Reef. I wanna try and get there
by this afternoon.

06:39.540 --> 06:41.740
Sounds great. What's there?

06:42.020 --> 06:44.380
You'll see.

07:18.100 --> 07:19.540
Hey, we're here.

07:31.660 --> 07:34.260
- You good? See you.
- Bye!

07:34.580 --> 07:36.500
Have fun!

07:50.100 --> 07:51.380
See you soon.

09:10.100 --> 09:12.700
Sorry.

09:13.900 --> 09:16.340
- You all right?
- Yeah.

09:16.620 --> 09:18.900
Come with me.

09:57.740 --> 09:59.660
Wow.

09:59.900 --> 10:02.460
Wow, wow.

10:03.700 --> 10:06.460
- How was that?
- Amazing.

10:10.180 --> 10:13.060
- Is this your favourite spot?
- Actually, I've never been here before.

10:13.340 --> 10:15.860
- Wanna go for a bit of an explore?
- Yep.

10:36.460 --> 10:38.340
No.

10:53.980 --> 10:55.620
Oh.

10:55.900 --> 10:57.780
Look what I found.

10:58.860 --> 11:00.740
Beautiful.

11:32.580 --> 11:33.820
What?

11:35.140 --> 11:37.020
I don't know.

11:38.260 --> 11:40.420
Is this just sex
or is it something else?

11:41.900 --> 11:43.220
I don't know.

11:44.300 --> 11:46.980
You know what I think?
I think you're scared.

11:48.140 --> 11:49.980
- Scared?
- Mm-hm.

11:50.300 --> 11:53.620
- Scared of what?
- Me.

11:53.980 --> 11:56.740
You. Us.

12:00.020 --> 12:01.460
No, that's not it.

12:02.500 --> 12:03.900
What is it, then?

12:04.180 --> 12:06.300
I don't know.

12:07.380 --> 12:08.820
- Come on, Kate, what?
- I don't know.

12:09.100 --> 12:11.380
One minute we're having a good time,
and now we're not.

12:11.700 --> 12:15.020
- I'll tell you what I think.
- I don't really care what you think.

12:16.460 --> 12:18.980
Hey, Luke, Kate!
There's something up with Warren.

12:26.420 --> 12:29.780
Tide's dropping really fast.

12:51.340 --> 12:55.220
We hit bottom.
Kate, can you keep an eye out?

13:01.860 --> 13:03.740
- I think it's leaking.
- Eh?

13:16.380 --> 13:18.540
- You're scraping.
- The tide's dropping really fast.

13:18.860 --> 13:21.300
I tried the engine.
She won't start.

13:27.180 --> 13:29.940
- OK, try now.
- Nothing.

13:30.220 --> 13:32.220
- Now.
- No, nothing.

13:32.500 --> 13:35.620
Jump on the anchor.
Katie, can you get the sail, please?

13:35.940 --> 13:37.580
Yeah.

13:59.380 --> 14:00.780
Channel's opened up!

14:05.300 --> 14:09.500
OK, I think we're out of trouble.
Thanks, guys.

14:11.620 --> 14:14.300
Hey, Waz,
take a look at that engine, yeah?

14:14.620 --> 14:16.460
Katie, steer.

14:16.700 --> 14:19.100
- Sure.
- Keep her straight, yeah?

14:20.100 --> 14:23.180
- We'll just keep it straight.
- Yeah.

14:23.540 --> 14:25.020
So, who wants a go?

14:26.900 --> 14:30.380
- Suze?
- Me?

14:30.700 --> 14:33.180
- Yeah, come on. Chance of a lifetime.
- Go on. Go on.

14:35.940 --> 14:36.980
Two hands.

14:37.740 --> 14:38.660
Good.

14:39.820 --> 14:41.780
- Sailing.
- Hey!

14:43.500 --> 14:44.980
Arr! Arr!

15:18.940 --> 15:22.820
Hey. Thought I'd come up
and catch the morning.

15:23.780 --> 15:24.780
It's gorgeous.

15:32.740 --> 15:34.660
I'm really sorry about yesterday.

15:34.940 --> 15:38.740
Yeah. Me too.

15:40.420 --> 15:42.540
- It's tricky, isn't it?
- Yeah.

15:44.180 --> 15:46.420
You don't have any doubts about us?

15:47.820 --> 15:48.820
Plenty.

15:50.500 --> 15:54.460
It's just, you know,
I really missed you.

15:55.700 --> 15:57.660
I really missed you too.

16:01.820 --> 16:04.100
- You hungry?
- Starving.

16:04.340 --> 16:05.940
- Brekky?
- Yes, please.

16:41.180 --> 16:42.740
Matt! Warren!

16:52.660 --> 16:55.180
You all right? We've gotta
get out of here. It could go down.

16:55.460 --> 16:58.140
Where's Matt? Matt? Matt?

17:06.940 --> 17:08.500
Luke! Matt!

17:10.980 --> 17:12.700
Oh, Suzie.

17:13.900 --> 17:16.220
Mattie! Warren!

17:18.300 --> 17:20.099
You all right?

17:20.380 --> 17:23.780
I'm gonna go down and get Matt.
Hey, Warren, you gotta get out.

17:25.940 --> 17:28.300
Come with me, right? Take a deep breath.

17:35.980 --> 17:39.060
- Matt. Where's Matt?
- Matt? Where's Matt?

17:44.740 --> 17:46.940
Matt! Mattie?

17:47.940 --> 17:49.980
Here! I'm here.

17:52.900 --> 17:54.860
It's stuck.

18:12.340 --> 18:14.340
This way, this way, this way.

18:14.580 --> 18:16.100
OK, follow me.

18:27.460 --> 18:30.820
You all right? You OK?
Yeah? You OK?

18:33.780 --> 18:37.500
- Let's get out of the water.
- Yeah. Yeah, sure.

18:44.340 --> 18:46.180
- Gonna have to push him.
- Yeah, OK.

18:46.380 --> 18:49.220
One, two, three!

18:50.340 --> 18:52.940
Up you get.

18:53.820 --> 18:55.500
All right, who's next?

18:58.300 --> 19:00.900
- You got me?
- Come on.

19:02.340 --> 19:04.900
OK, here we go. More hands.

19:18.180 --> 19:20.260
- You all right, Suze?
- Yeah.

19:20.540 --> 19:24.260
Fuck. Look at that.
Keel's been ripped off.

19:27.780 --> 19:29.780
- You OK?
- It's OK. You all right?

19:30.100 --> 19:31.980
Yeah.

19:32.900 --> 19:34.820
- What happened?
- Don't know.

19:35.060 --> 19:36.420
Must have hit something.

19:37.660 --> 19:40.700
Reef. A whale.

19:47.340 --> 19:49.220
The bulkheads are fucked.

20:07.700 --> 20:10.700
OK, guys, I don't think
we should stay here.

20:11.020 --> 20:15.780
There's a current.
We're drifting further out to sea.

20:17.620 --> 20:21.580
The boat's fucked.
I don't think it's gonna stay afloat.

20:22.860 --> 20:27.060
And when we do sink, we're in the water,
just further from land.

20:27.380 --> 20:30.740
- It mightn't sink.
- Well, is there an EPIRB?

20:31.100 --> 20:33.980
- What's an EPIRB?
- A distress beacon. Yeah, there is.

20:34.300 --> 20:38.260
Yeah, but it's an old one, so you need
a plane to fly over to get a signal.

20:38.620 --> 20:40.820
- We're not in a flight path.
- How do you know that?

20:41.100 --> 20:43.420
Seen any planes in the last few days?

21:07.300 --> 21:11.540
OK, I'm not saying we should
try and swim to the mainland,

21:11.900 --> 21:13.540
but I reckon
we could make Turtle Is land.

21:13.820 --> 21:15.460
No.

21:20.260 --> 21:22.460
- What are you doing?
- Point the 12 at the sun.

21:22.740 --> 21:26.860
Split the angle between the 12
and the hour hand. That's north.

21:32.140 --> 21:35.460
So, we're here, right?

21:35.780 --> 21:37.620
Turtle Is land is here.

21:37.860 --> 21:40.540
Now, we weren't going straight there,
because there's a reef here.

21:40.860 --> 21:44.420
But with the current, I reckon
if we swim north, we'll hit the island.

21:46.620 --> 21:52.220
- How far would we have to swim?
- Uh... 10, 12 miles.

21:52.660 --> 21:56.340
Good luck.
I've fished these waters, mate.

21:56.660 --> 21:59.060
I know what's out there.
I'm not getting in that water.

21:59.340 --> 22:01.700
What makes you think
they're not gonna come here?

22:01.980 --> 22:03.380
There's all sorts of shit
starting to rot.

22:03.660 --> 22:07.100
I don't wanna argue with you, mate,
honestly I don't. I just...

22:07.460 --> 22:09.580
I'm not getting in the water.

22:14.060 --> 22:19.180
All right, look, yeah,
there might be sharks, I don't know.

22:19.580 --> 22:21.540
What I do know
is that there's land over there

22:21.820 --> 22:25.700
and the longer we sit here,
the further we get away from it.

22:26.060 --> 22:28.340
We either swim for it
and try and save ourselves,

22:28.660 --> 22:31.260
while we've still got enough strength,

22:31.580 --> 22:34.100
or we can stay here
and hope the boat doesn't sink

22:34.380 --> 22:36.540
and that someone comes for us.

22:36.820 --> 22:42.820
And they'd better come soon, because
otherwise we'll die of dehydration.

22:50.700 --> 22:53.620
I'm not a great swimmer.
I don't think I could swim that far.

22:53.940 --> 22:55.660
Yeah, no. Me neither.

22:56.540 --> 22:57.580
OK.

22:58.340 --> 23:01.620
All right. I'll go down below and see
what I can find to keep us afloat.

23:06.460 --> 23:08.180
You need a hand?

23:08.420 --> 23:11.820
Yeah, if you're in the water,
I'll pass out whatever I find, yeah?

23:21.180 --> 23:23.460
- You OK?
- Yeah.

23:27.420 --> 23:29.300
- Here goes.
- OK.

24:45.380 --> 24:47.980
Luke! Luke!

24:48.660 --> 24:50.900
Hey, Luke! Luke!

24:52.100 --> 24:55.220
Luke, mate, can you hear me?

24:57.620 --> 25:01.740
There's something in the water.
Hey! Luke, quickly, get out! It's close!

25:06.700 --> 25:08.140
Get out now! Get out!

25:08.340 --> 25:12.540
Luke, there's something
in the water! Could be a shark!

25:14.900 --> 25:17.980
Luke, come on! Hurry up!

25:18.340 --> 25:20.780
Get out! Luke!

25:23.420 --> 25:24.940
Luke!

25:37.140 --> 25:38.060
Luke!

25:41.140 --> 25:43.700
Something broke the surface, over there.

25:43.940 --> 25:46.340
- Well, what was it?
- I don't know, but it was big.

25:50.500 --> 25:53.060
All right.
I've still got to find the EPIRB.

25:53.340 --> 25:56.100
So unless you see a really big shark,
don't warn me.

26:15.940 --> 26:17.380
See you soon.

28:44.860 --> 28:47.620
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

28:53.220 --> 28:54.900
Found it.

28:55.140 --> 28:57.820
- You know how to kick it off?
- It's good, mate.

28:58.100 --> 29:00.300
Yeah? OK, great.

29:08.260 --> 29:10.140
Try that.

29:12.580 --> 29:13.900
- For you.
- Thanks, mate.

29:16.020 --> 29:19.660
- What? What's the matter?
- You'll look like a seal in that.

29:22.020 --> 29:23.420
Sharks love seals.

29:25.420 --> 29:28.340
Mate, you don't wanna come,
that's your business.

29:28.620 --> 29:30.860
Don't go scaring everyone else,
all right?

29:36.380 --> 29:37.580
Maybe we should wait.

29:41.380 --> 29:43.180
OK, it's your choice.

29:45.460 --> 29:48.900
Look, I know
this is a difficult decision,

29:49.260 --> 29:52.020
but it's really easy
not to get found out here.

29:52.860 --> 29:56.460
This boat's gonna sink
and it's gonna sink soon.

29:56.820 --> 30:00.220
There's land over there and that's
where I think we should be going.

30:11.140 --> 30:13.460
I'm going with Luke.

30:35.940 --> 30:36.980
Me too.

30:44.540 --> 30:46.380
That's yours.

31:01.260 --> 31:04.820
Here you go. Take that. Yours.

31:09.100 --> 31:12.100
- I'm not going.
- Hey?

31:13.060 --> 31:14.420
I'm gonna stay here.

31:14.580 --> 31:16.340
It's a better option
than staying on the boat.

31:16.540 --> 31:19.180
What, swimming to an island
you can't see?

31:20.700 --> 31:22.100
Kate...

31:30.540 --> 31:32.060
OK.

31:46.900 --> 31:49.740
- OK, that's for you.
- Thanks.

31:50.060 --> 31:51.620
Are you sure about this?

31:55.100 --> 31:56.180
Yeah?

32:06.540 --> 32:09.140
- We'll send someone as soon as we can.
- OK.

32:09.420 --> 32:10.540
- OK?
- Yep.

32:13.060 --> 32:14.780
See you, mate.

32:15.060 --> 32:16.700
See you soon.

32:17.460 --> 32:19.580
Bye.

32:20.420 --> 32:22.220
- See you back there.
- Definitely.

32:25.980 --> 32:26.900
What are you doing?

32:28.820 --> 32:31.340
You know he knows the ocean
more than any of us.

32:32.940 --> 32:35.460
- Come on, Katie, come with us.
- I can't.

32:36.940 --> 32:38.820
I just... I just can't.

32:42.820 --> 32:44.820
- See you later, sis.
- Bye.

32:48.060 --> 32:48.980
Yeah?

32:56.620 --> 32:58.020
OK, let's go.

32:58.300 --> 33:01.700
- You look after her for me, all right?
- I will, don't worry. We're good.

33:32.100 --> 33:35.260
OK, so let's stick together.

33:36.500 --> 33:38.820
We're gonna get tired,

33:39.140 --> 33:42.580
but if we just stay at a steady pace,
we'll get there, yeah?

33:43.740 --> 33:48.220
Apart from that, relax and enjoy.
It's a once in a lifetime.

33:54.020 --> 33:55.020
Let's go.

34:46.219 --> 34:47.699
Hey, guys!

34:48.860 --> 34:51.780
- Not so much splashing.
- Did you see something?

34:52.020 --> 34:54.699
- No.
- Hey! Hey, wait!

34:54.980 --> 34:56.620
Wait! I'm gonna come with you!

35:10.460 --> 35:12.020
Come on. Come with us.

35:14.300 --> 35:17.100
- No.
- Are you sure?

35:18.100 --> 35:19.940
Yeah, no, you go. I'll be right.

35:53.300 --> 35:55.900
This is nuts.
I hope you're right about this.

35:56.220 --> 35:57.700
You're not the only one.

35:59.980 --> 36:04.700
Guys, don't worry, we'll make it.
We'll get there.

36:07.540 --> 36:09.380
- Here, take this.
- Are you sure?

36:09.660 --> 36:11.660
Yeah, it's all right.
We'll share this one.

36:11.940 --> 36:14.140
Thanks.

37:11.580 --> 37:14.340
Hey, guys. We're tired.

37:14.660 --> 37:17.940
So we focus our energy, huh?

37:19.060 --> 37:23.180
Imagine there's a guy with a huge rope
pulling us towards the island.

37:23.500 --> 37:26.340
- Or towards my bed.
- Mm.

37:30.660 --> 37:33.340
- There's always the last resort.
- What's that?

37:37.140 --> 37:42.700
When I'm at the gym and I'm trying
to break through the pain barrier,

37:43.140 --> 37:45.500
I imagine that I'm having sex.

37:50.260 --> 37:53.740
While you're doing weights,
you're imagining you're screwing?

37:54.100 --> 37:56.860
Not just screwing.
There's foreplay as well.

37:59.900 --> 38:01.580
Well, isn't there?

38:01.860 --> 38:02.980
Not often.

38:03.260 --> 38:06.380
Oh, come on!

38:06.660 --> 38:08.500
Don't listen to her.

38:12.180 --> 38:15.220
- Shit. What was that?
- What?

38:38.940 --> 38:39.940
Oh!

38:40.180 --> 38:41.500
What is it?

38:57.380 --> 38:58.820
Can't see anything.

39:00.660 --> 39:03.020
I think it's a school of small fish.

39:03.340 --> 39:05.420
- What are they doing?
- I don't know.

39:11.340 --> 39:13.900
OK, let's keep going.

39:18.940 --> 39:20.820
Come on.

40:18.500 --> 40:21.820
- What is it?
- Looks like a shell.

40:23.380 --> 40:26.300
- It's a turtle shell.
- Yeah, I think you're right.

40:26.620 --> 40:28.500
A turtle?

40:39.100 --> 40:40.500
Hey, Matt.

40:41.540 --> 40:42.900
Mattie.

41:33.460 --> 41:35.260
Oh, fuck!

41:42.820 --> 41:44.780
Let's get the fuck out of here.

41:57.780 --> 41:58.700
Come on, Suze.

42:12.420 --> 42:14.740
Hey, we can't stay here.

42:18.140 --> 42:20.100
Come on.

42:20.420 --> 42:24.260
I don't wanna stretch my legs out,
I really don't.

42:24.580 --> 42:26.020
- OK, all right.
- I can't move.

42:26.220 --> 42:30.500
It's all right. Listen, we've gotta go.
So do you want me to go behind you?

42:30.860 --> 42:33.420
Come on, love.
I'll go behind you, OK?

42:33.660 --> 42:35.660
I got you.

42:40.020 --> 42:41.340
- You OK?
- Yeah.

42:53.980 --> 42:57.300
- That was a big turtle.
- Fuck, yeah.

45:40.020 --> 45:40.940
What was that?

45:43.700 --> 45:45.940
- What?
- Over there, I saw something.

45:48.380 --> 45:49.820
I can't see anything.

45:51.580 --> 45:54.700
- Suzie, you're freaking me out.
- What's the matter?

45:54.980 --> 45:56.900
- There's something here.
- We have to keep going.

45:57.220 --> 46:00.140
- There's something following us.
- Suze, this is the ocean, OK?

46:00.420 --> 46:02.860
There's a million things out here, bub.
We've gotta keep going.

46:04.260 --> 46:06.180
We've gotta get going.

46:06.500 --> 46:08.900
Come on. Gotta go, all right?

46:09.140 --> 46:10.740
- It's all right.
- There!

46:14.020 --> 46:16.620
- All right, Suze, listen...
- I'm sure I saw something and it's big!

46:16.940 --> 46:20.660
- OK, so what did you see?
- I don't know. There! There, look.

46:32.420 --> 46:34.380
I can't see anything.

46:42.580 --> 46:44.660
Over there.

47:15.980 --> 47:18.660
- Did you see something?
- Don't know. Maybe.

47:18.980 --> 47:20.700
- I told you.
- What was it?

47:20.980 --> 47:23.060
- Was it a shark?
- I don't know, OK?

47:24.860 --> 47:26.740
Let's keep going.

48:34.420 --> 48:36.740
- OK, it's a shark.
- How big?

48:37.020 --> 48:39.220
It's big. It's all right. Come together.

49:00.340 --> 49:02.460
I can't see it.

49:05.180 --> 49:06.700
Get in together.

49:24.460 --> 49:26.260
Can you see it?
Luke, can you see it?

49:26.580 --> 49:28.860
I think it's gone.
I can't see it anywhere.

50:38.740 --> 50:42.180
Let's go. Let's go.
We've gotta go this way.

50:43.380 --> 50:45.260
This way.

51:16.300 --> 51:19.220
It's OK, it's OK.
I can't see it. It's moved away.

51:19.500 --> 51:23.300
It's OK. I can't see it. I can't see it.
You need to calm down.

51:23.620 --> 51:27.660
I can't see it. It's OK.
It's OK. It's OK.

51:28.020 --> 51:29.900
You have to stay calm.

52:18.300 --> 52:20.020
Katie. Katie.

52:20.300 --> 52:23.060
Katie. Katie. Katie.

52:24.820 --> 52:29.180
Take some deep breaths with me.
Deep breaths. Come on.

52:29.580 --> 52:32.420
You'll be all right. It's not gonna
get you. It's not gonna get you.

52:32.740 --> 52:35.180
Take a deep breath.

52:36.580 --> 52:38.140
It's gonna be all right.

52:38.380 --> 52:39.700
Deep breath.

52:39.980 --> 52:42.420
That's it. That's it.

53:17.060 --> 53:18.900
Matt. Matt.

53:19.220 --> 53:20.220
Hey, Mattie.

53:24.780 --> 53:26.340
Matt.

53:35.940 --> 53:37.100
Matt.

53:46.620 --> 53:49.140
- Matt!
- Matt!

53:49.420 --> 53:51.140
- Matt!
- Matthew!

53:51.380 --> 53:53.020
Matt! Matt!

53:54.420 --> 53:56.900
Matt! Mattie!

53:57.220 --> 53:59.100
Matt!

54:02.740 --> 54:04.380
There he is. Mattie!

54:07.540 --> 54:09.420
No! Go! Go!

54:11.540 --> 54:16.020
My fucking leg's gone!
No! Go! No!

54:16.460 --> 54:20.340
My leg's gone. You gotta...
No, you gotta go!

54:20.660 --> 54:22.540
- You gotta leave me!
- It's OK, it's OK.

54:22.780 --> 54:25.460
- Swim. I'm useless to you.
- No, you're coming with us.

54:25.820 --> 54:28.740
- Mattie, it's OK.
- He's gonna... He's gonna come back.

54:29.020 --> 54:31.860
Mattie, Mattie, Look at me.
It's OK. Just stay with me.

54:32.100 --> 54:36.460
- Quick, before he... before he...
- No, no, no. No, no, no.

54:36.820 --> 54:39.020
Mattie. Mattie.

54:45.900 --> 54:48.220
Matt. Mattie.

54:48.540 --> 54:51.140
Matt. Matt, come on, come on.

54:51.420 --> 54:55.300
Wake up. Wake up.
Please wake up. Wake up.

54:55.580 --> 54:56.620
Wake up, wake up.

54:59.580 --> 55:02.020
Come on. Mattie, wake up!

55:02.300 --> 55:04.540
Wake up! Please wake up!

55:05.340 --> 55:08.260
Wake up. Please.

55:09.020 --> 55:10.900
Katie!

55:14.340 --> 55:16.940
Katie, get out of there now!

55:17.220 --> 55:18.860
Oh, God. I love you.

55:19.140 --> 55:20.980
Katie!

55:22.940 --> 55:25.460
- Come on!
- Oh, God. I love you.

56:10.460 --> 56:11.380
Hey.

56:13.980 --> 56:15.580
Come on.

56:15.820 --> 56:17.700
Come on. Come on.

56:18.860 --> 56:20.740
Come on.

56:58.380 --> 57:01.220
- Did you say something?
- No.

57:02.220 --> 57:04.500
- What?
- You said something.

57:16.700 --> 57:18.580
It's gonna come back, isn't it?

57:23.260 --> 57:24.220
Isn't it?

57:26.500 --> 57:28.740
Didn't you say
we'd be there in three hours?

57:29.020 --> 57:31.180
How are we gonna get there now?

57:31.460 --> 57:35.180
We're lost in the middle of the ocean
in the middle of the fucking night!

57:35.540 --> 57:38.660
- Suzie...
- We never should have listened to you.

57:38.980 --> 57:41.060
We should have stayed on the boat
with Warren.

57:41.340 --> 57:45.540
And now Matt's dead!
And soon we're gonna be too!

57:45.900 --> 57:47.980
- We're fucked! We're so fucked!
- Suzie!

57:48.260 --> 57:49.980
We're so...

57:55.900 --> 57:57.780
I'm sorry about Matt.

58:01.260 --> 58:03.180
And I'm sorry about all of this.

58:07.420 --> 58:09.300
Luke, it's not your fault.

58:10.140 --> 58:12.060
It's not your fault.

58:12.340 --> 58:14.780
You didn't make us come with you.

58:19.620 --> 58:21.500
It's all right.

58:23.380 --> 58:25.580
It's all right. Hey.

58:28.220 --> 58:29.140
It's all right.

58:33.220 --> 58:35.340
What was that?

58:53.260 --> 58:55.900
Oh, my God.
Come together. Come together.

59:00.060 --> 59:01.500
Oh, my God!

59:02.540 --> 59:04.300
I don't wanna die!
I don't wanna die!

59:04.580 --> 59:06.860
Please! Help us!

59:07.140 --> 59:10.700
Oh, God, somebody help us!

01:00:15.900 --> 01:00:16.820
Hey.

01:00:20.980 --> 01:00:23.820
- Hey.
- Look.

01:00:28.580 --> 01:00:30.540
Oh. Hey.

01:00:31.900 --> 01:00:33.780
Suze.

01:00:34.940 --> 01:00:36.820
Look.

01:00:58.260 --> 01:00:59.660
Whoo!

01:01:13.020 --> 01:01:16.140
OK, be careful, huh? It's very sharp.

01:01:46.460 --> 01:01:48.340
Oh, it's so good to be out of the water.

01:01:56.660 --> 01:02:00.460
It's not Turtle Is land, but it's land.

01:02:11.620 --> 01:02:13.500
Let's keep going, then.

01:02:15.700 --> 01:02:17.580
Yeah.

01:03:33.380 --> 01:03:37.020
- Oh, I'm so sore.
- Me too.

01:04:08.820 --> 01:04:10.780
What?

01:04:11.060 --> 01:04:12.140
I don't know.

01:04:31.500 --> 01:04:33.300
Get back.

01:04:42.220 --> 01:04:44.100
Oh! It's a fucking dolphin.

01:05:07.140 --> 01:05:10.500
Moving pretty fast.
The current must have picked up.

01:05:10.820 --> 01:05:13.580
Finally the current is helping.

01:05:27.140 --> 01:05:28.340
Is that the dolphin?

01:06:00.420 --> 01:06:03.180
Suzie! Suzie!

01:06:05.980 --> 01:06:07.660
Suzie!

01:07:16.900 --> 01:07:18.780
Oh, fuck.

01:07:24.140 --> 01:07:25.620
It's OK. Come on.

01:07:28.940 --> 01:07:30.500
Come on.

01:07:54.340 --> 01:07:55.460
Oh, my God.

01:07:57.980 --> 01:07:59.860
Poor Suzie.

01:08:16.180 --> 01:08:18.060
It's the same one, isn't it?

01:08:20.620 --> 01:08:21.939
I think so.

01:08:22.819 --> 01:08:24.500
It is. I know it is.

01:08:40.979 --> 01:08:45.180
There's some more reef.
I think we should go.

01:09:33.740 --> 01:09:35.740
Luke! Luke!

01:09:36.020 --> 01:09:37.060
Luke!

01:09:38.100 --> 01:09:40.340
Luke! Luke!

01:10:07.180 --> 01:10:09.180
Come on. Come on.

01:10:09.420 --> 01:10:11.300
Come on, Luke.

01:10:34.220 --> 01:10:37.140
Come on. Come on, let's go.

01:10:38.420 --> 01:10:39.780
I... No.

01:11:52.620 --> 01:11:54.660
- You OK?
- Yeah.

01:12:09.500 --> 01:12:11.300
My... My foot, it's bleeding.

01:12:15.540 --> 01:12:16.860
Oh, shit.

01:12:32.780 --> 01:12:33.700
Sorry.

01:12:45.340 --> 01:12:46.260
Thanks.

01:12:47.980 --> 01:12:49.420
It's OK.

01:12:52.100 --> 01:12:53.420
I love you, Luke.

01:12:59.740 --> 01:13:01.620
I love you too.

01:13:24.060 --> 01:13:26.420
- You ready?
- No.

01:13:28.180 --> 01:13:30.340
Me neither.

01:13:32.700 --> 01:13:34.420
Let's go.

01:16:33.260 --> 01:16:35.780
Swim. Fucking swim!

01:17:22.540 --> 01:17:24.020
Come on, babe.

01:17:25.500 --> 01:17:26.420
Come on.

01:17:27.700 --> 01:17:29.900
Come on! Go!

01:17:30.220 --> 01:17:31.700
Come on!

01:17:32.420 --> 01:17:34.020
Go! Go!

01:17:42.620 --> 01:17:45.500
Pull me up! Pull me up!

01:17:45.820 --> 01:17:48.140
Take me! Take me!

01:17:48.420 --> 01:17:49.580
Pull me up! Pull me up!

01:17:51.900 --> 01:17:52.900
Come on. I can't!

01:17:54.740 --> 01:17:56.460
- Come on! Come on!
- Get me up!

01:17:57.980 --> 01:17:59.420
Pull me up! Pull me up!

01:18:07.180 --> 01:18:09.060
Luke!

01:18:10.580 --> 01:18:12.060
Luke!

01:18:19.020 --> 01:18:20.060
Luke!

01:18:26.700 --> 01:18:28.580
Luke!

01:18:30.340 --> 01:18:32.140
Luke!

01:18:32.300 --> 01:18:35.140
Please come home.
Please come home. Please.

01:19:26.241 --> 01:19:30.285
Kate was rescued the next day by
a fisher boat and brought to hospital.

01:19:30.286 --> 01:19:36.007
Despite intensive search Warren was
not found, nor any remains of the yacht.
