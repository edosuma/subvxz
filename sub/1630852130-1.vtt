00:28.945 --> 00:31.656
(EXCLAIMS) Branch down here
looking like a whole snack.

00:31.823 --> 00:33.408
And, got ya!

00:33.575 --> 00:36.036
Buckle up, kids!

00:36.202 --> 00:40.874
Hey, love the bow tie.
Well, you know,
it is the holiday season.

00:41.041 --> 00:42.834
Which is why
I brought you these.

00:43.001 --> 00:45.086

My favorite.

(BLOWS) Yuck!

00:56.890 --> 01:00.977
Poppy, I know we're going on
a picnic, but do we really
need this much food?

01:01.144 --> 01:04.731
It's not food.
They're invitations
that we're going to deliver

01:04.898 --> 01:07.692
for the first annual
Trolls Kingdom Secret
Holiday Gift-Swap!

01:07.817 --> 01:10.653

What happened to the whole

"balloon ride over Trolls
Kingdom hang-out" kinda thing?

01:13.656 --> 01:14.574
We're still doing that.

01:14.741 --> 01:18.286
We're just multitasking.
Multitasking, right.

01:18.453 --> 01:21.581
All right, here's the deal.
I put a name inside
each invitation.

01:21.748 --> 01:24.334
Uh-huh.
Whoever gets your name
is your secret person.

01:24.501 --> 01:25.960
Ooh!
Ah, ah!

01:27.545 --> 01:28.296
Secret. Then in three days,
we all meet back
in Pop Village

commence!

01:30.507 --> 01:32.842
You on board, Branchifer?
No.

01:33.009 --> 01:36.096

I can't think of a rhyme.

03:34.297 --> 03:35.548
What's happenin' to me?

03:35.715 --> 03:36.966
Sounds like
you lost your flow.

I've lost my flow?

my friend Rhyme-a-Saurus.

He'll help you get
your flow back.

03:47.227 --> 03:50.397

grab our own invitations.

rhyme and have you
on your way.

that rhymes with "diamond,"

and get my flow back.

05:06.806 --> 05:08.391
Got any suggestions?

05:10.185 --> 05:12.395
Uh, let me give that one
a think. Consult the page,
review the ink.

"Almond...

Wow, Poppy.
That is one massive gift.

Yeah, who's
the lucky Troll?

Wait, you got
your boyfriend?
That's a lot of pressure.

06:42.652 --> 06:45.613
Pressure? Come on.
It's me we're talking about.

06:45.780 --> 06:50.952
The Gift Master,
the Gift-inator. I've got it
covered. Who did you get?

06:51.119 --> 06:53.580
Mr. Dinkles...
Whoever that is.

06:53.747 --> 06:55.582
That's Biggie's pet.
He's a worm.

06:55.749 --> 06:58.043
A worm? That's awesome.

06:58.209 --> 07:00.462
But, what do I get a worm?

07:00.628 --> 07:02.922
(GASPS) Get him a hat.
He lost his old one.

07:13.516 --> 07:14.934
(SPEAKING ENGLISH)
See? I'm full of
gift-spiration.

07:15.101 --> 07:17.062
And there's plenty
to go around.

07:17.228 --> 07:18.855
All right, guys,
not gonna lie.

07:18.980 --> 07:21.983
I've been kinda freaking out
over what to get the ultimate
gift-giver.

07:22.150 --> 07:23.943
But I think I figured it out.

07:24.110 --> 07:26.821
Whoa, nice
vision board, Branch.

07:26.988 --> 07:29.616
And not at all
insane-looking.

07:29.783 --> 07:32.535
Thank you.
Okay. As everybody knows,

07:32.702 --> 07:35.497
giving the wrong gift
can be a real relationship
death sentence.

07:35.663 --> 07:37.665
If I go too small,
I'll disappoint her.

07:39.084 --> 07:41.086
<i>If I go too big,</i>

07:41.252 --> 07:42.170
<i>I'll freak her out.</i>

07:43.588 --> 07:45.632
<i>I can't let that happen.</i>

07:45.799 --> 07:48.259
So I came up with
an equation that led me
to the perfect gift for Poppy.

07:48.426 --> 07:49.886
"A" represents Queen Poppy.

07:50.053 --> 07:51.971
"B" is all of
her queenly responsibilities.

07:52.138 --> 07:55.141
"C" is the amount
of time spent doing
her hair every morning.

07:55.308 --> 07:58.269
Therefore, "A plus B square,
minus the cosine
of square root of C..."

07:58.436 --> 08:00.522
You both see where I'm going
with this.
BOTH: Yeah.

08:00.689 --> 08:02.440
Poppy never stops
multi-tasking.

08:02.607 --> 08:05.568
So, I'm gonna build her
something that will
save her time.

08:05.735 --> 08:09.072
I give you the world's first
Troll hair-doer.

08:09.197 --> 08:12.200
I just need to go to Poppy's
place and get the exact
measurements of her head

08:12.367 --> 08:14.202
without her noticing,
and I'm good to go.

08:14.369 --> 08:17.789
Well, that doesn't
sound creepy at all.

08:17.956 --> 08:22.002
Tiny? Are you playing
some kind of holiday
hide-and-seek?

08:22.168 --> 08:24.629

Well, come in,
sweet sparkle child.

08:32.178 --> 08:34.556
Your father is quite
worried about you.

08:34.723 --> 08:36.266
Yeah, I know.
I don't wanna
worry him,

08:36.433 --> 08:39.102
but I can't go home
until I get my flow back...

08:39.269 --> 08:41.438
Uh-uh, I already know
why you're here.

08:41.604 --> 08:45.233

and get mystical.

08:56.578 --> 08:57.579
Ahhh!

09:00.415 --> 09:03.251
And we're done.
Your back should
be completely healed.

09:03.418 --> 09:05.211
My back? What?

09:05.378 --> 09:07.589
No, I came here
to get my flow back.

09:07.756 --> 09:10.633

so I can give my daddy
his holiday gift.

09:10.800 --> 09:12.594
What do I do now?

09:14.512 --> 09:16.931
Well, you go see
the Cloud Monks at the temple
on the top of that mountain.

09:17.098 --> 09:18.808
I gotta go all the way
to the top of that mountain?

09:18.975 --> 09:20.935
No, not that mountain.

at gift-giving.

you gots it.

"Operation Measure
Poppy's Head" is a go.

09:50.340 --> 09:53.551
...and then I realized,
"Why am I not using
double-sided tape?"

09:53.718 --> 09:56.054
I mean, it's basically twice
as good as single-sided tape.

09:56.221 --> 09:58.098
The clue's in the name,
you know?
Uh, Branch?

09:58.264 --> 09:59.724
What you doing there,
little bud?

09:59.891 --> 10:02.060
Oh. Hey. What's up?

What a nice surprise.

10:04.354 --> 10:06.189
Yeah. Surprise!

some wrapping paper
for my gift.

is this your gift swap
present? It looks great.

10:14.280 --> 10:17.033
Nope, that one's mine.

did it up so pretty.

10:51.735 --> 10:52.569
What? Why?

10:53.403 --> 10:54.529
Because... Picture!

10:55.321 --> 10:56.823
Ah!

10:56.948 --> 10:58.783
Perfect. I'll cherish
this moment forever.

10:58.908 --> 10:59.868
(GASPS)

11:01.578 --> 11:06.374
Poppy got me,
and the gift is so big.

11:06.499 --> 11:09.252
(SHUDDERS)
Wait, you forgot
the wrapping paper.

11:09.419 --> 11:11.087
I'll probably
just use grocery bags.
You know...

11:12.839 --> 11:14.591
Now, that boy is odd.

11:19.804 --> 11:22.557
Hmm...
Wow, looks good.

11:22.724 --> 11:24.225
Mmm-hmm.
Poppy's gonna love that.

11:25.935 --> 11:27.103
Yeah, you're right.
It's not big enough.
Her gift was ginormous.

11:29.064 --> 11:30.607
I'm gonna build a scrapbooking
machine and attach it
to the hair styler.

11:33.610 --> 11:35.987
Sweet. Now it's
definitely done.

11:36.112 --> 11:38.114
Agreed. Still got
to go bigger.

11:38.239 --> 11:40.950
I'll attach a smoothie maker
so Poppy can get
her hair done,

11:41.117 --> 11:44.454
make scrapbooks, and drink her
favorite Troll berry banana
smoothies. Great idea!

11:49.250 --> 11:50.251
It's perfect!

11:50.335 --> 11:52.253
Prince D, you wanna
take her for a spin?

11:52.796 --> 11:54.047
Uh, yeah, no.

11:54.214 --> 11:55.924
All right, here I am.

11:56.091 --> 11:58.218
My hair's getting done,
and then I'm like,

11:58.385 --> 12:01.721
"Oh, rats, I forgot to make
a scrapbook for Biggie's
half birthday!"

12:08.061 --> 12:10.605
It's working! It's working!

12:10.772 --> 12:12.524
Yep! Sure is!

12:12.691 --> 12:16.820
And now, for the final touch.
The smoothie maker!

12:25.120 --> 12:26.496
Ahhh!

12:33.586 --> 12:35.839
So, what did you end up
getting Poppy?
What?

12:37.924 --> 12:39.551
BRANCH: Ooh!

12:39.718 --> 12:40.677
I think I broke my butt.

12:50.145 --> 12:52.605
Guys, how am I supposed to get
my flow back

12:52.731 --> 12:54.649
if you're all doing this
vow of silence thing?

13:00.947 --> 13:02.699
"You already have the Gift."

13:02.824 --> 13:04.659
Pff! That's nonsense, tea!

13:07.704 --> 13:08.872
(CLEARS THROAT)

13:10.498 --> 13:14.544
"Look through the clutter."
What clutter?

13:14.711 --> 13:18.715
Come on, Tiny.
What makes him so special?

13:18.882 --> 13:20.550
What do you mean,
what makes him so special?

13:20.717 --> 13:21.551
He's just my...

13:24.012 --> 13:25.513
Daddy!

13:27.515 --> 13:32.312
Yeah! Okay.
I think I got it now.

13:32.479 --> 13:34.939
<i>* Been around the world</i>

13:35.106 --> 13:37.734

<i>Everything I said was whack</i>

13:37.901 --> 13:40.779

13:40.945 --> 13:43.907
<i>* And I finally realized</i>

13:44.032 --> 13:46.493

13:50.789 --> 13:52.415
You did it, son.

13:52.540 --> 13:56.044
Yes! I got my flow back!

13:56.211 --> 13:57.962
Dude, did that guy's
tattoo just talk?

13:58.088 --> 13:59.964
Hey, you just broke
your vow of silence.

14:00.131 --> 14:01.800
You just broke
your vow of silence.

14:01.966 --> 14:02.967
Wait, does
that mean...

(GASPS)
(GROANS) Ow.

14:12.143 --> 14:15.605
What's up, Branch? You look...
You look bad, man.

14:15.772 --> 14:17.399
No other way to say it.
What happened?

14:17.941 --> 14:19.818
I failed, Tiny.

14:19.984 --> 14:24.364
I tried to make Poppy a gift,
and it blew up in my face.
Literally.

14:24.531 --> 14:26.574
Say no more, bro.
Let Tiny help you out.

14:26.700 --> 14:28.410
Yeah? Okay.

14:30.286 --> 14:32.414
You just need to look through
the clutter and focus
on what's important.

14:32.580 --> 14:34.082
You already have
the gift, dude.

14:34.666 --> 14:37.293
You already have it.

You see it now,
don't you?

14:53.893 --> 14:56.187
Nope, not even a little bit.

14:56.354 --> 14:58.982
Oh, come on.
The winds even blew
in a magical way.

15:06.656 --> 15:08.658
Look through the clutter.

15:21.838 --> 15:23.298
You always know

15:23.465 --> 15:25.842
just what to get to make
someone feel special.

Don't you, Poppy?

15:28.178 --> 15:29.512
(CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY)

15:29.679 --> 15:31.806
I'm sure Branch
is gonna love his gift.

15:34.142 --> 15:35.352
Yeah.

15:43.193 --> 15:43.360

15:43.860 --> 15:45.028
Hello, everyone.

(MUFFLED) Incredible.

16:01.002 --> 16:01.711
Oh, it's lit!

I love it.
Oh, cool!

16:06.007 --> 16:07.008
(GRUNTS)

16:09.386 --> 16:12.222
A Never-Break guitar?
I've always wanted
one of these.

I know.

16:13.932 --> 16:15.392

Who did you get?

(BOTH CHUCKLE NERVOUSLY)

16:25.193 --> 16:27.487
I'll tell you if you tell me.

Both of us at the same time?

16:29.322 --> 16:32.325
One, two, three. You!
One, two, three. You.

16:33.493 --> 16:34.869

16:34.994 --> 16:36.371
Okay. Um...

16:37.330 --> 16:38.707
Do you wanna go first?

16:38.873 --> 16:41.918
Well, I made you this really
cool thing.

16:42.085 --> 16:43.795
I'm sure it's great.

16:43.920 --> 16:45.672
But it exploded
and blew me into a tree.

16:45.839 --> 16:47.674
That's not... Not so great.

16:47.841 --> 16:49.884
Yeah, I may have
overdone it a bit.

16:51.261 --> 16:54.097
Anyway, this is all I could
scrape together.

16:54.931 --> 16:56.057
Here...

16:58.101 --> 16:59.602
I know it's kinda lame.

17:13.742 --> 17:16.286
Branch, you scrapbooked?

17:16.953 --> 17:18.788
For me?

17:18.955 --> 17:22.834
Yeah. And I think
I permanently glued two of
my fingers together doing it.

17:23.001 --> 17:24.044
(CHUCKLES)

17:24.169 --> 17:27.088
I love it.
It's a gift only you
could give me.

Hey, cool.

17:44.731 --> 17:46.858
An invisible
mountain bike?

17:47.025 --> 17:49.486
No way.
I got the same thing.

17:50.236 --> 17:51.696
I...

17:51.863 --> 17:53.782
I didn't get you anything.

17:53.948 --> 17:56.117
Because when I tried
to think about

17:56.284 --> 17:59.329
what to get the coolest troll
in the whole world,

17:59.496 --> 18:00.747
I totally drew a blank.

18:00.830 --> 18:05.126
I mean, what do you even get
someone who is so sweet,

18:05.293 --> 18:08.546
and so funny,
and kind, and cute,

18:08.713 --> 18:13.176
and, like,
weirdly overprepared
for everything?

You know,
the thing I like most
about the holidays

with you.
