00:07.880 --> 00:11.240
<i>They do make it look easy,</i>
<i>don't they, on the telly?</i>

00:11.320 --> 00:12.560
-<i>On the Olympics?</i>
<i>-Yeah.</i>

00:12.640 --> 00:15.240
<i>Yeah. I don't think</i>
<i>you'll make it this year.</i>

00:15.320 --> 00:16.320
<i>-No?</i>
-<i>No.</i>

00:17.760 --> 00:19.240
<i>-Oh God.</i>
<i>-Oh my God!</i>

00:19.320 --> 00:20.960
-<i>Yeah.</i>
<i>-We're just going around.</i>

00:21.040 --> 00:22.720
-<i>People are looking.</i>
<i>-They're not!</i>

00:22.800 --> 00:25.160
<i>People are looking at me</i>
<i>and going, "Aw."</i>

00:25.240 --> 00:27.000
<i>No, they're looking at </i>me <i>and going, "Aw."</i>

00:27.080 --> 00:30.040
<i>They're going, "Look at him.</i>
<i>He's trying to help her, but she's--"</i>

00:30.120 --> 00:31.800
<i>-He's not trying to help her!</i>

00:31.880 --> 00:36.760
<i>He's just laughing at her and filming her!</i>
<i>That's not helping!</i>

00:41.920 --> 00:42.760
-Hi.
Hi.

00:42.840 --> 00:45.400
The back door was open so I just came in.

00:45.480 --> 00:46.720
-Good. Hungry?
-Yes.

00:46.800 --> 00:48.520
-Where do you wanna we go?
-Somewhere quick.

00:48.600 --> 00:50.360
-Got to be at work at 10:00.
-Okay.

00:50.880 --> 00:52.560
Do you want to go rowing sometime?

00:52.640 --> 00:54.080
-Rowing?
-Yes.

00:54.160 --> 00:57.040
Just for a laugh, on the boating pond?

00:57.640 --> 00:58.920
Boating pond? Why?

00:59.440 --> 01:02.600
Don't know. I just thought it might be
something you might quite like to do.

01:03.520 --> 01:04.680
Not really.

01:05.600 --> 01:06.680
See you later!

01:06.760 --> 01:07.640
Come on, Em.

02:56.040 --> 02:57.480
-Morning.
-Morning.

03:00.520 --> 03:01.360
You ready?

03:01.440 --> 03:02.480
Oh, hold on.

03:08.280 --> 03:09.200
You all right?

03:09.280 --> 03:10.480
-What?
-Sit down.

03:10.560 --> 03:13.200
"What?" What kind
of greeting is that? Hello.

03:14.640 --> 03:15.920
-Wanna come over later--
-No.

03:16.000 --> 03:16.880
I haven't finished.

03:18.120 --> 03:19.840
To the house for some dinner.

03:19.920 --> 03:22.240
You could bring Emma.
Do a foursome or something.

03:23.080 --> 03:24.440
Me and Emma aren't a twosome.

03:25.520 --> 03:27.400
That's fine.
I just mean there'll be four of us.

03:27.480 --> 03:30.080
Right. Well, I'll bring Brian, then,
if it's purely mathematical.

03:30.160 --> 03:31.840
God. Nothing is simple with you, is it?

03:33.400 --> 03:35.640
Just bring your nice,
platonic friend Emma.

03:35.720 --> 03:37.680
We'll have a nice, grown-up time.

03:38.720 --> 03:42.080
I'll be honest, it'd be good for us.
Me and Jill.

03:42.840 --> 03:45.960
It's fun having people over, isn't it?
We don't get out much and--

03:46.560 --> 03:49.760
Well, I think that was part of the problem
with the little hiccup in our marriage.

03:49.840 --> 03:51.640
What? Not having people over?

03:52.240 --> 03:54.040
-No. You know what I mean.
-No.

03:55.600 --> 03:57.680
Okay, get this, yeah?

03:58.200 --> 04:01.240
Jill thinks I'm not very adventurous.
Can you believe that?

04:01.320 --> 04:02.160
Yeah.

04:03.200 --> 04:04.120
But seriously.

04:04.720 --> 04:07.600
It's ridiculous. I've got two cagoules.

04:08.200 --> 04:10.120
Why would I need those
if I wasn't adventurous?

04:10.200 --> 04:14.160
Or you could say, how adventurous is a man
who doesn't like getting his hair wet?

04:14.240 --> 04:15.680
I've been looking at camping gear.

04:15.760 --> 04:17.360
-Wow.
-I'm probably gonna buy those boots.

04:20.920 --> 04:23.160
Come on, come over. Please.

04:23.240 --> 04:25.920
Help me prove her wrong.
I feel a bit misunderstood.

04:26.000 --> 04:26.880
Go on Oprah.

04:27.520 --> 04:30.320
Is there any way to prove her wrong
without me being involved?

04:30.400 --> 04:32.840
It's not a big deal!
You don't even have to stay long.

04:32.920 --> 04:36.200
Just you and Emma come over,
we have some fun, done.

04:37.360 --> 04:39.760
-Don't you have to warn Jill?
-No, spontaneous.

04:41.840 --> 04:46.000
I mean, I will call her now and tell her.
Otherwise she'll get in a bit of a tizz.

04:46.520 --> 04:49.680
She'll want to get ready and we don't
usually do a big sit-down meal.

04:49.760 --> 04:53.880
Eat before you come, and then we'll just,
you know, have some drinks,

04:53.960 --> 04:56.160
put on some tracks, have a few laughs.

04:56.240 --> 04:57.600
There'll be no laughter.

04:58.280 --> 04:59.200
7:30?

04:59.280 --> 05:01.360
I'm usually
on my second bottle of wine by then.

05:01.440 --> 05:03.280
Okay, perfect.
You can drink it at my place.

05:03.360 --> 05:04.560
-Right.
-Yeah?

05:04.640 --> 05:05.480
-Okay.
-Great.

05:05.560 --> 05:06.760
If Emma's up for it.

05:06.840 --> 05:08.320
-Oh.
-Thank you.

05:09.240 --> 05:11.200
Oh fucking hell.

05:11.280 --> 05:13.120
-I can hear you.
-I know.

05:13.200 --> 05:15.480
-Wait 'til you're out of the office to--
-Come on.

05:17.560 --> 05:19.080
What a shit day already.

05:31.760 --> 05:32.840
-Hiya.
-Hiya.

05:33.360 --> 05:35.160
How's it going with your friend, Tony?

05:35.240 --> 05:39.080
Hmm. Well, exactly that, really.
We're just friends.

05:40.040 --> 05:42.480
Even that's a bit tense at times,
to be honest.

05:43.160 --> 05:45.400
We haven't even taken a selfie together.

05:46.120 --> 05:46.960
Oh.

05:47.040 --> 05:50.000
Well, he must be mad
not to pay you more attention.

05:51.160 --> 05:52.000
Right.

05:54.120 --> 05:56.880
I thought it would be nice
to document my 50th novel.

05:56.960 --> 06:00.440
Fifty? Wow. How long
have you been writing?

06:00.520 --> 06:03.880
Oh, been writing all my life, dear.
It's all I've ever wanted to do.

06:04.600 --> 06:06.680
Wrote my first published novel
when I was 15

06:06.760 --> 06:09.480
and I've written
at least one a year ever since.

06:09.560 --> 06:11.160
Wow. Who is your publisher?

06:11.800 --> 06:12.840
Self-published, dear.

06:12.920 --> 06:15.680
I designed the cover and everything.
It's very professional.

06:16.360 --> 06:19.760
Not in a-- Not in a money-making sense.

06:19.840 --> 06:22.720
I've actually lost money,
but, you know, it's a passion, isn't it?

06:22.800 --> 06:24.560
-Yep.
-I've got to leave something behind.

06:24.640 --> 06:27.520
I never married or had children
or anything, so, you know…

06:28.680 --> 06:30.240
How do you make your money though?

06:30.320 --> 06:31.440
I'm a medium.

06:31.520 --> 06:32.640
Right.

06:32.720 --> 06:37.280
I read people's auras or palms
or crystal balls, tea leaves, anything.

06:38.400 --> 06:41.040
But this is my passion. Novels.

06:41.120 --> 06:44.960
And they're all about
one person, are they?

06:45.040 --> 06:45.920
Yes.

06:46.000 --> 06:48.240
Dr. Barnaby Love, MD.

06:48.840 --> 06:51.280
I combine medical drama
with erotic fiction.

06:52.320 --> 06:55.320
"Dr. Barnaby Love, MD,
in Two in a Deathbed."

06:55.400 --> 06:59.640
Why is it "Dr. Barnaby Love, MD,
<i>in</i> Two in a Deathbed"?

06:59.720 --> 07:04.360
Well, I always hoped it'd be picked up
as a long-running series, like <i>Columbo.</i>

07:05.000 --> 07:06.760
But sadly not.

07:07.480 --> 07:09.600
Mm, my first choice,
back in the day, was Roger Moore,

07:09.680 --> 07:12.480
but nowadays it would probably
be someone like George Clooney.

07:12.560 --> 07:16.000
I mean, he's played a doctor, hasn't he?
He'd know what he was doing.

07:16.080 --> 07:17.480
Probably knows more than me.

07:17.560 --> 07:19.760
You haven't had any medical training?

07:19.840 --> 07:20.840
No.

07:21.600 --> 07:25.120
-How do you get the technical stuff right?
-Eh, just pick things up.

07:26.080 --> 07:26.920
Sure.

07:27.960 --> 07:30.400
Would you like me to read a bit
from my latest one?

07:30.480 --> 07:31.320
Yeah.

07:32.680 --> 07:33.600
<i>Open Wide.</i>

07:35.280 --> 07:36.840
Not that bit. That's filth.

07:36.920 --> 07:38.680
Let's have a look. Here's a good bit.

07:38.760 --> 07:41.280
So Dr. Barnaby is,
um, operating on someone

07:41.360 --> 07:44.760
that all the top surgeons in the world
said could not be saved.

07:44.840 --> 07:46.680
But Dr. Barnaby disagrees.

07:46.760 --> 07:49.320
Okay. "Nurse Stacey mopped his brow."

07:49.920 --> 07:51.720
"'Is that better, Doctor?'"

07:51.800 --> 07:55.080
"Their eyes meet over the masks
you have to wear in operating theaters."

07:55.800 --> 07:57.160
"'Please, call me Barnaby.'"

07:57.800 --> 08:00.200
"She blushes. 'Okay, we're going in!'"

08:00.280 --> 08:03.000
"He injects the medicine
into the patient's main artery."

08:03.080 --> 08:06.080
"'That should do the trick,' said Barnaby.
'Okay, stitch him up, Nurse.'"

08:06.160 --> 08:08.880
"'Dinner later?' 'Ooh, yes, please,'
she said. 'See you at 8.'"

08:09.960 --> 08:11.000
There.

08:14.280 --> 08:16.200
-Does he live?
-Who, dear?

08:16.280 --> 08:17.400
The patient.

08:17.480 --> 08:19.560
Oh, I didn't say. Didn't bother with that.

08:20.520 --> 08:23.640
I'm sure he's fine if they got
the medicine into the main artery.

08:23.720 --> 08:24.560
Exactly.

08:24.640 --> 08:28.360
I wonder why all the top surgeons
around the world didn't think of that.

08:28.440 --> 08:30.680
Eh, Dr. Barnaby's special, isn't he?

08:30.760 --> 08:32.440
He's best in the world.

08:33.000 --> 08:35.200
A randy bugger, too, which never hurts.

08:37.280 --> 08:38.960
-Good. Take a picture.
-Yep.

08:40.440 --> 08:41.320
Smile.

08:41.400 --> 08:42.280
Ooh.

08:42.920 --> 08:43.760
Great.

08:44.680 --> 08:47.280
-Will this be in next week's paper, dear?
-Yep.

08:47.360 --> 08:50.280
Could you mention that I'm doing
a live reading and book signing

08:50.360 --> 08:51.280
at the Tambury Fair?

08:51.360 --> 08:52.520
Sure.

08:52.600 --> 08:56.240
Oh, good. And do bring your wife along.
It's mostly for women.

08:56.320 --> 08:58.680
I, uh-- I don't have a wife.

08:58.760 --> 09:00.400
Oh, gay? Even better.

09:00.480 --> 09:02.040
I'm not gay. Just--

09:03.760 --> 09:04.720
I, uh--

09:04.800 --> 09:05.880
I lost my wife.

09:05.960 --> 09:06.920
Oh, I'm sorry.

09:07.680 --> 09:09.120
Would you like to contact her?

09:09.200 --> 09:10.360
With all my heart.

09:10.880 --> 09:12.800
-Okay. Well--
-No, I mean--

09:13.880 --> 09:14.880
I-- I don't--

09:14.960 --> 09:17.440
I don't believe in all that.
But-- But thank you.

09:18.640 --> 09:19.600
This is for you.

09:21.440 --> 09:22.880
Open Wide, <i>though.</i>

09:22.960 --> 09:25.560
I mean, in this context,
that only means one thing.

09:25.640 --> 09:26.680
-Yeah.
-Doesn't it?

09:31.080 --> 09:32.320
I-- I hate that.

09:32.920 --> 09:36.080
He knew we were crossing the road,
but he had to save that ten seconds

09:36.160 --> 09:38.840
'cause he's got such an important job
as a full-time cunt!

09:40.360 --> 09:43.200
I always wish I had a brick
to put through the fucking window.

09:43.280 --> 09:45.160
That'd be the last piece of the jigsaw.

09:45.240 --> 09:47.400
You actually carrying a brick
around with you,

09:47.480 --> 09:48.960
hovering around zebra crossings.

09:49.040 --> 09:51.280
It'd be a social service.
I'd be like Batman.

09:51.360 --> 09:52.200
But mental.

09:52.280 --> 09:54.280
Yeah. Maybe I'm not grieving.

09:54.360 --> 09:56.920
Maybe I'm just an arsehole.
I just like punishing people.

09:57.000 --> 09:59.080
Classic vigilante story, innit?

09:59.160 --> 10:01.520
I am like Batman, or Dexter.

10:01.600 --> 10:05.120
He was a serial killer, but his dad
taught him only to kill bad people,

10:05.200 --> 10:06.640
but he was just mental.

10:06.720 --> 10:07.880
Or Spider-Man.

10:07.960 --> 10:11.800
His uncle got killed and he went fucking
sorting out bad people, didn't he?

10:11.880 --> 10:14.440
Didn't he get bitten by a spider?
I don't remember the uncle bit.

10:14.520 --> 10:17.600
Yeah, and then he made himself
a poncy little outfit.

10:17.680 --> 10:21.880
I wouldn't bother with that.
I'd just wear my own clothes. So, uh--

10:21.960 --> 10:24.400
Also, I would fucking batter Spider-Man.

10:24.480 --> 10:27.560
Puny little twat in tight kids pajamas?

10:27.640 --> 10:31.480
-He's got Spidey senses though.
-Yeah? Stomp! Squashed!

10:33.160 --> 10:37.840
"Dr. Barnaby leaned back
on his leather office chair, thoughtful."

10:37.920 --> 10:42.200
"He was worried about a patient who had
the worst brain tumor he had ever seen."

10:42.280 --> 10:45.600
"There was a knock at the door.
'Come in,' said Dr. Barnaby."

10:45.680 --> 10:48.360
"The door opened to reveal Nurse Cindy,

10:48.440 --> 10:51.520
the most attractive nurse
in the hospital." Obviously.

10:51.600 --> 10:55.200
"'Oh sorry,' she said. 'The ladies
changing rooms are out of order,

10:55.280 --> 10:58.000
so I wondered if I could change here,
as you're a doctor.'"

10:58.080 --> 10:59.760
"'Of course,' said Dr. Barnaby."

10:59.840 --> 11:01.160
"'I'm a surgeon,

11:01.240 --> 11:02.560
so a naked female body

11:02.640 --> 11:05.560
isn't the same as it would be
to the average red-blooded male.'"

11:05.640 --> 11:06.880
I can't read any more.

11:06.960 --> 11:08.280
-Read it.
-No, you read it.

11:08.880 --> 11:09.720
Oh God.

11:11.360 --> 11:14.800
"Nurse Cindy starts to slowly undress.
She was sexy as hell,

11:14.880 --> 11:17.320
and she notices Dr. Barnaby
looking at her differently

11:17.400 --> 11:19.320
than he would if he was operating on her."

11:19.400 --> 11:21.520
-"'Do I look well, Doctor?'"

11:21.600 --> 11:23.960
"'I'll say,' said Dr. Barnaby."

11:24.480 --> 11:27.080
"'Think you'd better check
my pulse, Nurse.'"

11:27.160 --> 11:30.000
It's sort of sweet, really.
Sort of old-fashioned and hopeful.

11:30.080 --> 11:31.560
And she's a fortune teller too.

11:32.080 --> 11:34.040
-She said she is, yeah.
-Why would she lie?

11:34.560 --> 11:37.000
-'Cause it's impossible.
-Nothing's impossible.

11:37.080 --> 11:38.160
I'm out.

11:38.680 --> 11:42.040
Just 'cause you haven't seen something
doesn't mean it isn't real.

11:42.120 --> 11:43.440
What if no one's seen it?

11:44.120 --> 11:45.000
Could be invisible.

11:46.160 --> 11:47.760
-Yeah.
-Could I visit her?

11:47.840 --> 11:49.120
You know, to investigate it?

11:50.600 --> 11:53.080
-If you want.
-I'd go in with an open mind.

11:53.160 --> 11:56.040
You know, if you go in thinking
it isn't real, then you'll never believe.

11:56.120 --> 11:57.520
Should I arrange that, then?

11:58.040 --> 11:58.880
Yeah.

11:59.600 --> 12:01.360
Now I wish I was covering the story.

12:03.720 --> 12:04.800
Oh, here he is.

12:05.920 --> 12:07.680
I told you to wait outside.

12:09.800 --> 12:13.160
He's giving me a lift to a meeting.
We're not an item, obviously.

12:13.240 --> 12:16.240
I just like turning up in a Rolls-Royce.
He knows that, don't you?

12:16.320 --> 12:18.240
-Yeah.
-Yeah, works out well.

12:19.880 --> 12:22.920
-What's in it for you, Colin?
-People think he's got a girlfriend.

12:23.560 --> 12:26.680
But he knows
that can never be the case. Shame.

12:27.520 --> 12:30.960
What, with the Rolls-Royce and him being
a self-made millionaire and a nice bloke,

12:31.040 --> 12:33.400
it would've been perfect,
if not for the obvious.

12:34.400 --> 12:37.000
-What?
-The face! Duh.

12:37.760 --> 12:41.080
Yeah, the face.
Even my mum calls me the ugly one.

12:42.120 --> 12:43.480
And you're okay with that, Colin?

12:45.000 --> 12:46.240
It's heartbreaking.

12:46.320 --> 12:47.640
I'm destroyed.

12:47.720 --> 12:51.440
I used to wish I was dead growing up.
But what can you do?

12:52.400 --> 12:56.240
Exactly, and that is why I want
everyone to know he's not my boyfriend.

12:58.080 --> 13:00.360
Maybe you should wear a chauffeur's hat.

13:00.880 --> 13:02.400
Or a chauffeur's mask.

13:02.480 --> 13:06.320
-She fancied him for a bit, didn't she?
-She did, Colin. She did.

13:06.400 --> 13:07.840
She's obviously got a type.

13:09.880 --> 13:12.040
Anyway, come on, we'll be late.

13:14.120 --> 13:15.120
Come on.

13:15.200 --> 13:16.400
Like a dog.

13:17.360 --> 13:20.400
-Could you get back to work, please?
-No way. It's not worth it.

13:20.480 --> 13:23.000
Please. Come on.
Wasted enough time.

13:34.840 --> 13:36.160
Hey, here's a new one.

13:36.680 --> 13:39.240
-What's worse than a maggot in your apple?
-Dunno.

13:39.320 --> 13:41.760
Finding your ex-wife in Safeway's car park

13:41.840 --> 13:44.360
getting gangbanged
by some Dutch lorry drivers.

13:45.040 --> 13:48.760
Yeah, finding a maggot in your apple's
nothing after that, boy. Trust me.

13:49.880 --> 13:53.160
Anyway, I'm gonna start taking my comedy
a little bit more seriously.

13:54.200 --> 13:56.640
Life has kicked the shit out of me
in recent years,

13:57.200 --> 14:00.320
but I've reached rock bottom
so the only way is up, innit?

14:00.400 --> 14:04.000
Yeah. As for me, like, Ken's getting me
a couple of auditions here and there.

14:04.080 --> 14:05.560
Like small bits and stuff like that.

14:05.640 --> 14:06.520
-Shit.
-What?

14:07.160 --> 14:08.400
I can't believe it.

14:09.000 --> 14:10.800
My ex-wife and Micky the Gypsy.

14:11.320 --> 14:12.360
Is he violent?

14:12.880 --> 14:14.160
Absolutely psycho.

14:15.120 --> 14:17.800
Mind you, I've seen her
bottle a traffic warden. Aye.

14:17.880 --> 14:19.640
You do the mathematics.

14:22.520 --> 14:23.360
Heya.

14:24.520 --> 14:26.240
-All right?
-All right.

14:26.320 --> 14:28.120
All right, Micky? Yeah?

14:29.160 --> 14:32.720
James, this is Micky.
And this is my ex-wife, Elizabeth.

14:32.800 --> 14:33.920
Hiya.

14:34.000 --> 14:36.120
-All right?
-Still together, then?

14:36.200 --> 14:37.400
On and off, yeah.

14:37.920 --> 14:40.240
She was shagging Spud Head for a while.

14:41.320 --> 14:43.200
He caught us at it, didn't you?

14:44.960 --> 14:45.800
Awkward.

14:47.240 --> 14:48.120
It wasn't awkward.

14:49.280 --> 14:52.400
Gave me the excuse
to smash the granny out of the cunt.

14:53.440 --> 14:54.600
Bloodbath, wasn't it?

14:55.200 --> 14:56.120
Proper mess.

14:56.720 --> 14:58.920
-Turned out quite well, really.
-You know me.

14:59.880 --> 15:01.920
I like to look at things
in a positive way.

15:02.000 --> 15:03.280
I know you do, mate.

15:03.360 --> 15:06.720
My problem is
I just want to try and please everyone.

15:07.960 --> 15:09.360
She's a slag, mate.

15:09.440 --> 15:10.600
He knows.

15:11.280 --> 15:12.960
You well though? You well though?

15:14.080 --> 15:14.920
Can't complain.

15:16.000 --> 15:18.520
Anyway, always nice to see you.

15:19.560 --> 15:22.280
I'll just, uh, see you later.

15:22.360 --> 15:23.320
-Be lucky.
-Yeah.

15:23.400 --> 15:24.240
Bye.

15:26.240 --> 15:29.320
We'll, uh, ease past Elizabeth's hip.

15:29.400 --> 15:31.960
-Yeah, do the one-wheel trick.
-That's it.

15:37.600 --> 15:39.440
That's how pathetic
your best mate is, James.

15:39.520 --> 15:42.000
-You are not pathetic, sir!
-Proper loser.

15:42.080 --> 15:44.320
-Not compared to me though.
-You're joking, aren't you?

15:44.400 --> 15:46.800
-No.
-You can sing, dance.

15:47.320 --> 15:50.720
Play two recorders with your nose.
You can knit. You're great with wool.

15:51.320 --> 15:52.600
You're great with wool.

15:53.560 --> 15:56.160
If you're a loser,
what chance have the rest of us got?

15:56.240 --> 15:57.240
Cheers, mate.

15:57.880 --> 16:00.320
Do you wanna go up the tip?
See if there's any action?

16:00.400 --> 16:04.080
You betcha! I've got to swing by
my agent's first, if that's all right.

16:04.160 --> 16:06.040
-I'll come with you, boy.
-Right.

16:15.960 --> 16:16.800
All right?

16:17.520 --> 16:18.360
Yes.

16:19.600 --> 16:22.160
I was just saying to Stan
you'd be along soon.

16:22.240 --> 16:23.160
Right.

16:23.240 --> 16:24.960
-Good day at work?
-Yep.

16:25.920 --> 16:28.240
-You still talk to him?
-Every day.

16:29.080 --> 16:30.640
Not just here. Everywhere.

16:32.600 --> 16:34.920
I don't get funny looks at home though.

16:37.760 --> 16:38.840
It really helps.

16:39.880 --> 16:41.480
Saying it out loud, I mean.

16:42.920 --> 16:44.160
You hear yourself.

16:46.560 --> 16:51.520
Yeah, I've never been one
for talking to myself. I'd probably argue.

16:51.600 --> 16:54.240
You wouldn't be talking to yourself.

16:56.200 --> 16:57.040
No.

16:57.680 --> 16:59.600
I do feel like she's still here.

17:00.760 --> 17:02.600
And it's like I'm in two minds.

17:04.240 --> 17:05.560
One knows the truth.

17:06.880 --> 17:07.720
She died.

17:08.800 --> 17:09.640
Logical.

17:10.600 --> 17:14.000
There's no heaven.
No reincarnation, no ghosts.

17:15.400 --> 17:16.240
I know that.

17:18.760 --> 17:20.840
But then I feel her

17:21.640 --> 17:22.480
inside me.

17:23.480 --> 17:24.360
All the time.

17:26.480 --> 17:29.160
Like she's still part of me, guiding me.

17:30.520 --> 17:32.160
It's weird.

17:34.760 --> 17:36.160
That's because you're human,

17:37.120 --> 17:39.160
and nothing really makes sense.

17:41.200 --> 17:42.680
Look at you, Kierkegaard.

17:45.160 --> 17:47.360
It's okay to have feelings, you know.

17:49.400 --> 17:51.000
Things that aren't logical.

17:52.440 --> 17:55.520
Science makes us understand
how to stay alive longer.

17:56.640 --> 17:59.480
Feelings give us the reason to want to.

18:02.720 --> 18:03.640
Or not want to.

18:04.880 --> 18:06.440
I was doing so well.

18:08.360 --> 18:09.480
I'm fine.

18:11.160 --> 18:12.200
Hmm.

18:20.720 --> 18:23.080
-Mum.
-Hello, darling. What are you doing here?

18:23.160 --> 18:24.960
I'm here for a business meeting.

18:25.040 --> 18:27.480
-Aw, bless ya.
-What are you doing here?

18:27.560 --> 18:30.120
-She's doing my highlights.
-Yeah, helping out.

18:30.200 --> 18:32.480
Never mind that.
What are we gonna do with you?

18:32.560 --> 18:35.600
Still delivering local newspapers?
What's he like?

18:35.680 --> 18:39.120
Well, I've got to earn money.
Mum says I'm old enough now to pay rent.

18:39.200 --> 18:40.680
It's only fair, isn't it, Ken?

18:40.760 --> 18:43.200
Oh, hanging round with losers though?

18:43.280 --> 18:44.640
-No offense.
-None taken.

18:44.720 --> 18:46.000
Me and Brian are a team.

18:46.080 --> 18:47.880
-He wants representation too.
-For what?

18:47.960 --> 18:49.760
-To pursue his stand-up.
-Big time.

18:50.520 --> 18:52.160
I'm ready. I wanna go for it.

18:53.040 --> 18:55.440
I'm tired of having
my confidence destroyed

18:56.280 --> 18:57.720
and being useless.

18:57.800 --> 18:58.760
You are useless though.

18:58.840 --> 19:02.160
You've got absolutely no chance
of getting anywhere in comedy.

19:02.920 --> 19:04.400
I can feel my bravado ebbing away.

19:04.480 --> 19:06.240
You said
you could make anyone a star.

19:06.320 --> 19:07.600
I'm not bloody magic!

19:07.680 --> 19:10.080
-He's not bloody magic, mate.
-I'd be wasting my time on that.

19:10.160 --> 19:11.840
-Pointless, innit?
-That's not the attitude!

19:11.920 --> 19:13.160
-Oh, is it not?
-No, it isn't!

19:13.240 --> 19:14.840
-You do it, then.
-I will!

19:14.920 --> 19:17.720
Good! Keep you busy,
'cause I can't get you any work at all.

19:17.800 --> 19:18.640
Brilliant.

19:19.320 --> 19:21.640
-Don't matter though.
-What doesn't?

19:21.720 --> 19:22.840
Being a loser.

19:24.040 --> 19:25.400
I still love ya.

19:26.760 --> 19:27.600
That's nice.

19:45.680 --> 19:47.800
-Oh, all right?
-Yeah, you?

19:47.880 --> 19:50.800
Yeah. You know,
bearing up under the circumstances.

19:54.280 --> 19:56.440
-What circumstances?
-Well, Roxy.

19:56.520 --> 19:58.040
What's happened to Roxy?

19:58.120 --> 20:00.000
-You know.
-No, what?

20:00.520 --> 20:02.920
-Well, she's my bird now, isn't she?
-Yeah.

20:04.880 --> 20:05.720
And?

20:05.800 --> 20:08.480
And she's sucking off blokes
left, right, and center, isn't she?

20:08.560 --> 20:09.400
Oh, right.

20:10.480 --> 20:11.320
I don't know.

20:11.400 --> 20:13.480
-You do know 'cause I'm telling ya.
-Yeah, but why?

20:13.560 --> 20:16.400
-It plays on my mind.
-Okay, right.

20:18.680 --> 20:20.160
I don't know what you want me to say.

20:21.560 --> 20:22.400
Gas bill.

20:23.000 --> 20:23.840
Right.

20:25.880 --> 20:26.720
See ya.

20:28.760 --> 20:29.600
See ya.

20:41.640 --> 20:42.840
Ugh.

20:44.280 --> 20:45.680
It's nice, innit, just to--

20:46.840 --> 20:48.720
-just to sit down.

20:48.800 --> 20:50.160
-End of the day.
-Yeah.

20:50.240 --> 20:53.560
I've actually been sat down
most of the day at the--

20:54.720 --> 20:57.200
You weren't wearing a pink jumper
at work though, were you?

20:57.280 --> 20:58.440
It's not. It's salmon.

20:58.520 --> 20:59.760
Salmon pink, yeah.

20:59.840 --> 21:03.120
With no T-shirt on underneath.
Interesting.

21:03.200 --> 21:07.320
Just like the feel of wool
against your skin?

21:07.400 --> 21:11.040
Well, it's merino wool,
so it's super soft. Um--

21:11.120 --> 21:13.440
-You were a bit hot.
-I did have a T-shirt on, yeah.

21:13.520 --> 21:14.400
So I thought,

21:15.840 --> 21:18.080
"T-shirt off, jumper on."

21:18.160 --> 21:20.560
-Sure.
-And never looked back.

21:23.120 --> 21:24.000
Oh, um,

21:24.640 --> 21:27.600
-Jill got you a house plant.
-I mean, it's for both of you.

21:29.160 --> 21:31.200
How can a house plant be for both of us?

21:32.160 --> 21:33.880
-I live alone.
-Well, I just--

21:33.960 --> 21:36.400
I can look at it when I come round.

21:36.480 --> 21:38.800
Um, she was just being polite, okay?

21:38.880 --> 21:40.800
-So Emma didn't feel left out.
-Right.

21:41.440 --> 21:42.360
Thank you.

21:45.480 --> 21:48.080
Don't water it too much. Um--

21:48.160 --> 21:49.480
It's a cactus, so--

21:51.280 --> 21:52.520
I like your painting.

21:53.480 --> 21:54.360
It's one of Lisa's.

21:55.600 --> 21:57.960
-It's not one of her best.
-What do you mean?

21:58.040 --> 21:59.880
-No, I just--
-If you don't like it, I'll have it.

21:59.960 --> 22:03.000
I do like it. I'm just saying
that's how good an artist she was,

22:03.080 --> 22:04.560
that it's not one of her best.

22:04.640 --> 22:07.520
-Right.
-Please don't be like this, okay?

22:08.800 --> 22:10.720
Uh, I think I'm gonna go.

22:11.720 --> 22:13.880
-Okay, am I coming with you?
-No.

22:14.600 --> 22:18.960
I'm not in the mood. I knew I wouldn't be.
But, no, seriously, stay.

22:19.480 --> 22:21.480
Uh, I'll be fine.

22:23.640 --> 22:24.480
Thank you.

22:27.280 --> 22:29.240
-Uh, I--

22:29.920 --> 22:31.520
I'm so sorry about that.

22:32.840 --> 22:33.880
He's still not well.

22:33.960 --> 22:35.440
He's fine.

22:36.320 --> 22:40.640
He's obviously still in love with Lisa,
and I'm never gonna be a substitute,

22:41.160 --> 22:43.160
and I think he wants everyone
to know that.

22:47.360 --> 22:49.080
-We think you're so--
-Cool.

22:49.160 --> 22:51.160
-Great for--
-Very-- Very good.

22:51.240 --> 22:52.520
-Patient.
-And kind.

22:53.120 --> 22:55.400
-Well, I'm a grown-up. 

23:15.280 --> 23:16.480
Don't overwater it.

23:18.640 --> 23:19.520
Cunt.

23:53.160 --> 23:54.000
<i>Thoughts?</i>

23:54.880 --> 23:56.240
<i>Best snowman ever!</i>

23:56.320 --> 23:58.120
<i>-Snowperson!</i>
-<i>Oh. Yeah.</i>

23:58.200 --> 23:59.320
<i>-Yeah.</i>
-<i>My bad.</i>

23:59.840 --> 24:01.320
<i>-Could be either gender.</i>
<i>-Mm-hmm.</i>
