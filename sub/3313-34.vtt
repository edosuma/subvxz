WEBVTT

00:07.928 --> 00:09.589
"MELISSA AND JOEY" IS RECORDED IN
FRONT OF A LIVE STUDIO AUDIENCE.

00:09.590 --> 00:11.761
JOE! JOE!

00:11.762 --> 00:14.344
GET IN HERE AND SEE WHAT
YOUR FIANCEE HAS DONE.

00:14.345 --> 00:15.895
HEY, GOOD. YOU'RE HOME.

00:15.896 --> 00:17.347
LISTEN, I HAVE TO
TELL YOU SOMETHING.

00:17.348 --> 00:18.598
UGH! ME FIRST.

00:18.599 --> 00:20.600
I JUST SPENT SO MUCH MONEY.

00:20.601 --> 00:24.104
I MELTED THE STRIP OFF
THREE CREDIT CARDS.

00:24.105 --> 00:26.566
THAT'S A NEW PERSONAL
BEST FOR YOU, ISN'T IT?

00:26.567 --> 00:28.858
LISTEN, HONEY, I GOT SOME NEWS.

00:28.859 --> 00:29.909
WELL, YOU'LL HAVE
TO WAIT TILL I TALK

00:29.910 --> 00:31.361
'CAUSE I AM THE
BRIDE AND THE BRIDE

00:31.362 --> 00:33.653
- ALWAYS GETS HER WAY.
- OKAY.

00:33.654 --> 00:35.245
YOU CAN ONLY USE THAT
BRIDE-TO-BE CARD

00:35.246 --> 00:36.706
FOR ANOTHER THREE WEEKS THOUGH
UNTIL WE ACTUALLY GET MARRIED.

00:36.707 --> 00:39.038
OH, YOU KEEP TELLING
YOURSELF THAT, HANDSOME.

00:39.039 --> 00:41.871
OKAY, LET'S GO TO
MY WEDDING BIBLE

00:41.872 --> 00:43.583
AND FIGURE OUT WHAT MIRACLES

00:43.584 --> 00:44.834
I HAVE ACCOMPLISHED TODAY.

00:44.835 --> 00:46.336
OKAY, I ORDERED THE MATCHBOOKS,

00:46.337 --> 00:48.928
I CHOSE MY BOUQUET, AND I
NARROWED IT DOWN TO THREE VEILS.

00:48.929 --> 00:52.262
OH, AND MOST IMPORTANT, I
SELECTED OUR CHAMPAGNE

00:52.263 --> 00:54.013
AFTER A THOROUGH AND
RIGOROUS TASTING

00:54.014 --> 00:55.935
OF 40 DIFFERENT SPARKLING WINES.

00:55.936 --> 00:57.727
WHICH ONE DID YOU PICK?

00:57.728 --> 00:59.309
OH, WHO KNOWS?

00:59.310 --> 01:00.810
I'M GONNA BE AS
SURPRISED AS YOU ARE.

01:00.811 --> 01:03.483
HONEY, I THOUGHT YOU ALREADY
CHOSE ALL THE STUFF

01:03.484 --> 01:05.105
YOU LIKED FOR THE WEDDING
AFTER YOU WERE PLANNING

01:05.106 --> 01:06.486
YOUR FRIEND CARRIE'S WEDDING.

01:06.487 --> 01:07.897
BRIDES LIKE TO CHANGE THEIR
MINDS AT THE LAST MINUTE.

01:07.898 --> 01:09.449
OH, BUT DON'T WORRY.
I'M TOO EXHAUSTED

01:09.450 --> 01:12.071
- TO CHANGE THE GROOM.
- THAT'S GOOD TO KNOW.

01:12.072 --> 01:13.153
THANKS.

01:13.154 --> 01:14.154
IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU GOT
A LOT LEFT TO DO.

01:14.155 --> 01:15.325
I MEAN, MAYBE EVEN TOO MUCH

01:15.326 --> 01:16.696
JUST FOR ONE PERSON, YOU KNOW?

01:16.697 --> 01:18.408
YOU MIGHT NEED SOME HELP.
MY MOTHER WOULD ACTUALLY,

01:18.409 --> 01:20.250
YOU KNOW, LOVE TO HELP
YOU PLAN THE WEDDING.

01:20.251 --> 01:22.041
AND YOU TOLD HER NO, RIGHT?

01:22.042 --> 01:23.333
YEAH, THAT WOULDN'T WORK.

01:23.334 --> 01:24.874
SEE, THE WORD "NO"
OCCURS AT A FREQUENCY

01:24.875 --> 01:27.207
THAT SHE DOESN'T HEAR.

01:27.208 --> 01:30.089
WELL, YOU BETTER FIND A
WAY TO MAKE HER HEAR IT.

01:30.090 --> 01:31.971
SAY IT LOW.

01:31.972 --> 01:35.095
YEAH, HONEY, LISTEN. BEFORE YOU GO...
OH, BOY.

01:36.387 --> 01:40.180
MEL! LET ME GIVE MY
JOEY'S BRIDE A HUG.

01:40.181 --> 01:42.142
GLORIA.

01:42.143 --> 01:43.603
HOW UNANNOUNCED.

01:43.604 --> 01:46.025
I MEAN, UNEXPECTED.

01:46.026 --> 01:48.067
FOR THE NEXT THREE WEEKS,

01:48.068 --> 01:49.939
YOU'RE NOT GONNA HAVE
TO LIFT A FINGER.

01:49.940 --> 01:53.323
I'M GONNA TAKE CARE OF
EVERY LAST WEDDING DETAIL.

01:53.324 --> 01:55.576
OH, NO. THAT'S NOT NECESSARY.

01:56.737 --> 01:57.867
( low pitch ) I MEAN, NO,

01:57.868 --> 02:00.119
THAT'S NOT NECESSARY.

02:00.120 --> 02:01.741

02:24.144 --> 02:25.565
HE'S SO PROUD.

02:25.566 --> 02:27.647
HE'D NEVER ADMIT
YOU NEEDED HELP,

02:27.648 --> 02:29.769
BUT OF COURSE YOU DO.

02:29.770 --> 02:31.150
OH, NO, NO.

02:31.151 --> 02:33.233
I REALLY, REALLY DON'T.

02:33.234 --> 02:36.616
OH, HONEY, I KNOW WHY THIS
IS A HURRY-UP WEDDING.

02:36.617 --> 02:39.078
( laughs )

02:39.079 --> 02:41.871
I PUT TWO AND TWO TOGETHER.

02:41.872 --> 02:43.873
I AM NOT PREGNANT.

02:43.874 --> 02:45.245
OH, OF COURSE YOU'RE NOT.

02:45.246 --> 02:48.378
IF, UH, YOU NEED TO
HIT SOMETHING, HONEY,

02:48.379 --> 02:50.049
YOU CAN JUST HIT ME, OKAY?

02:50.050 --> 02:52.252
MY WEDDING BIBLE.

02:52.253 --> 02:56.636
THIS BOOK HAS HELPED
A DOZEN BRIDES

02:56.637 --> 02:57.717
PLAN THEIR WEDDING.

02:57.718 --> 02:59.299
AND NOW IT'S YOURS.

02:59.300 --> 03:03.803
WELL, EVERYTHING IN
HERE IS FROM THE '90s.

03:03.804 --> 03:07.517
OH, THE LAST GREAT
DECADE FOR STYLE.

03:07.518 --> 03:11.611
WHO DOESN'T LOVE
AN OVERSIZED BOW?

03:11.612 --> 03:13.273
OH! I BROUGHT A WHOLE COLLECTION

03:13.274 --> 03:14.524
IN A PET CARRIER.

03:14.525 --> 03:16.817
SINCE THE DOG DIED, WHAT
AM I GONNA DO WITH IT?

03:18.909 --> 03:20.490
IF SHE THINKS FOR ONE SECOND

03:20.491 --> 03:21.531
SHE IS TAKING OVER
THIS WEDDING...

03:21.532 --> 03:22.992
HONEY, SHE IS NOT TAKING OVER.

03:22.993 --> 03:24.994
SHE JUST WANTS TO FEEL USEFUL.

03:24.995 --> 03:28.628
SHE PUT HER WEDDING BIBLE
ON TOP OF MY WEDDING BIBLE.

03:28.629 --> 03:29.959
THAT IS NOT AN ACCIDENT.

03:29.960 --> 03:32.962
- THAT IS AN ACT OF WAR.
- OKAY, ALL RIGHT, LOOK.

03:32.963 --> 03:35.044
LET'S... LET'S THINK ABOUT
POSITIVE THINGS, ALL RIGHT?

03:35.045 --> 03:36.796
BECAUSE WE'RE PLANNING
THIS WEDDING SO QUICKLY,

03:36.797 --> 03:38.968
VERY FEW OF OUR RELATIVES ARE
ACTUALLY GONNA BE ABLE TO COME.

03:38.969 --> 03:40.179
YOU KNOW, LIKE... LIKE YOUR MOM.

03:40.180 --> 03:40.971
I MEAN, SHE'S NOT GONNA
BE ABLE TO MAKE IT

03:40.972 --> 03:42.512
BECAUSE SHE'S STILL ON HER

03:42.513 --> 03:44.434
PLASTIC SURGERY TOUR
OF SOUTH AMERICA.

03:44.435 --> 03:45.935
OH, THAT'S RIGHT.
SHE CAN'T TRAVEL

03:45.936 --> 03:47.807
UNTIL HER BUTT SETTLES.

03:47.808 --> 03:49.609
YES, AND MY DAD'S NOT
GONNA BE ABLE TO MAKE IT

03:49.610 --> 03:51.060
BECAUSE MY DAD'S
BEEN AWOL FOR THE...

03:51.061 --> 03:52.772
YOU KNOW, THE LAST TWO DECADES.

03:52.773 --> 03:54.193
AND MY BROTHER TONY,
AFTER THE WAY

03:54.194 --> 03:55.445
HE HIT ON YOU THE LAST
TIME HE WAS HERE,

03:55.446 --> 03:56.736
WELL, HE'S CERTAINLY
NOT WELCOME ANYMORE.

03:56.737 --> 03:58.027
AND MY SISTER'S STILL IN JAIL.

03:58.028 --> 03:59.449
WE REALLY LUCKED
OUT WITH THAT ONE.

03:59.450 --> 04:01.361
YOU SEE? THE SYSTEM WORKS.

04:01.362 --> 04:02.992
SO WE SHOULD BE HAPPY. I
MEAN, HONESTLY, HONEY,

04:02.993 --> 04:05.325
IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT, THE
RATIO OF DIFFICULT RELATIVES

04:05.326 --> 04:06.956
WHO CAN AND CAN'T
COME TO OUR WEDDING

04:06.957 --> 04:08.368
IS REALLY VERY
MUCH IN OUR FAVOR.

04:08.369 --> 04:10.209
YEAH, BUT WHAT DO WE
DO ABOUT YOUR MOM?

04:10.210 --> 04:11.371
LISTEN TO HER IDEAS.

04:11.372 --> 04:12.462
TELL HER THAT YOU'LL
THINK ABOUT IT,

04:12.463 --> 04:13.713
THEN, YOU KNOW, YOU
DO WHATEVER YOU WANT.

04:13.714 --> 04:16.005
OH, YOU MEAN, LIKE I DO WITH...

04:16.006 --> 04:18.468
PEOPLE AT WORK?

04:18.469 --> 04:20.881
THAT WAS A NICE SAVE.

04:24.345 --> 04:25.475
( knocking )

04:25.476 --> 04:28.057
OH, YOU GOT YOUR
NERD UNIFORM ON.

04:28.058 --> 04:29.769
HA. ACTUALLY, MY OFFICIAL TITLE

04:29.770 --> 04:32.061
IS GAME MASTER.

04:32.062 --> 04:34.654
NOW, THERE'S A PANTY-DROPPER.

04:34.655 --> 04:36.275
SO, UH, LISTEN.

04:36.276 --> 04:38.027
I NOTICED FACEBOOK IS BLOWING UP

04:38.028 --> 04:40.360
WITH HUMBLE BRAGS ABOUT
COLLEGE ACCEPTANCES.

04:40.361 --> 04:42.782
AND I WAS JUST WONDERING
IF THERE WAS ANY NEWS

04:42.783 --> 04:44.664
ON THE COLLEGE FRONT
IN THIS ROOM.

04:44.665 --> 04:47.206
NOPE, 'CAUSE I
DIDN'T APPLY TO ANY.

04:47.207 --> 04:49.329
RYDER, ARE YOU CRAZY?

04:49.330 --> 04:50.460
UH, NO. NO.

04:50.461 --> 04:51.871
CRAZY WOULD BE GOING TO COLLEGE

04:51.872 --> 04:54.213
WHEN YOU ALREADY
HAVE A SWEET CAREER.

04:54.214 --> 04:56.546
YOU WORK AT A LASER TAG PLACE

04:56.547 --> 04:58.047
AND YOU MAKE MINIMUM WAGE.

04:58.048 --> 05:00.259
BUT I HAVE MAXIMUM FUN.

05:00.260 --> 05:03.883
NO, RYDER, YOU HAVE
TO GO TO COLLEGE.

05:03.884 --> 05:06.726
YOU KNOW WHAT? PLENTY
OF SUCCESSFUL PEOPLE

05:06.727 --> 05:08.097
DIDN'T GO TO COLLEGE, OKAY.

05:08.098 --> 05:10.189
ABRAHAM LINCOLN, HARRY TRUMAN,

05:10.190 --> 05:12.482
MOSES,

05:12.483 --> 05:14.984
JESUS.

05:14.985 --> 05:17.397
OKAY, YOU GET 12 DISCIPLES
AND I'LL BACK OFF.

05:17.398 --> 05:20.530
LOOK, THIS JOB MAY BE CUTE NOW,

05:20.531 --> 05:23.072
BUT IT'S NOT GONNA BE
SO CUTE WHEN YOU'RE 35,

05:23.073 --> 05:24.744
LIVING IN A BASEMENT,
PLAYING CALL OF DUTY

05:24.745 --> 05:26.746
ALL DAY, AND EATING
NOTHING BUT JUNK FOOD.

05:26.747 --> 05:28.998
YOU MAKE MY FUTURE SOUND...

05:28.999 --> 05:31.451
AWESOME.

05:31.452 --> 05:33.122
ALL RIGHT, THAT'S IT.
I'M TELLING MEL AND JOE

05:33.123 --> 05:34.874
ABOUT THIS COLLEGE
THING RIGHT NOW.

05:34.875 --> 05:36.716
OH, YEAH, YEAH.
THAT'S GREAT TIMING.

05:36.717 --> 05:38.958
WHY DON'T YOU TELL
AUNT MEL AND JOE

05:38.959 --> 05:40.720
WHILE THEY'RE ALL STRESSED
OUT ABOUT THE WEDDING?

05:40.721 --> 05:42.051
UGH, OKAY, FINE!

05:42.052 --> 05:44.424
I WON'T TELL THEM YET, BUT
I AM GOING TO FIX THIS.

05:44.425 --> 05:45.725
I AM NOT LETTING YOU
WASTE YOUR LIFE

05:45.726 --> 05:47.887
FISHING QUARTERS OUT OF
BROKEN ARCADE GAMES.

05:47.888 --> 05:50.019
LENNOX, NO. THAT
WOULD NEVER HAPPEN.

05:50.020 --> 05:51.892
WE USE TOKENS.

05:55.736 --> 05:57.897
REAL CANDLES ARE SO MESSY.

05:57.898 --> 06:01.360
WHAT YOU WANT ARE THE
BATTERY-OPERATED ONES.

06:01.361 --> 06:03.443
- BUT I LOVE REAL CANDLES.
- ( glass clinking )

06:03.444 --> 06:05.945
- ( louder clinking )
- AND... I WILL THINK

06:05.946 --> 06:07.197
ABOUT THAT.

06:08.579 --> 06:09.619
AND FOR THE RECEPTION,

06:09.620 --> 06:10.870
YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO ALL CRAZY

06:10.871 --> 06:12.161
WITH THE SALMON AND THE STEAK.

06:12.162 --> 06:15.254
STICK TO THE CLASSICS, RAVIOLI.

06:15.255 --> 06:18.668
HUH, WEDDING RAVIOLI?

06:18.669 --> 06:20.129
YEAH, I'LL THINK ABOUT THAT.

06:20.130 --> 06:21.961
YOU KEEP SAYING YOU'LL
THINK ABOUT THAT,

06:21.962 --> 06:23.212
BUT I DON'T THINK YOU'RE
GONNA THINK ABOUT THAT.

06:23.213 --> 06:24.714
ARE YOU HUMORING ME?

06:24.715 --> 06:28.558
NO! I MEAN, WHAT KIND OF
PERSON WOULD DO THAT?

06:28.559 --> 06:30.389
NOT MEL, MOM, BECAUSE SHE
VALUES YOUR OPINION.

06:30.390 --> 06:31.721
SO WHAT'S NEXT ON THE LIST?

06:31.722 --> 06:33.392
TABLECLOTHS.

06:33.393 --> 06:35.935
WELL, I AM GOING WITH
A CLASSIC WHITE.

06:35.936 --> 06:37.356
ROOKIE MISTAKE.

06:37.357 --> 06:39.939
YOU WANT RED... COVERS
THE WINE STAINS.

06:39.940 --> 06:42.231
BUT THE BRIDE WANTS WHITE.

06:42.232 --> 06:43.733
WHAT DO YOU SAY, JOSEPH?

06:43.734 --> 06:46.325
WHITE OR RED?

06:46.326 --> 06:48.367
UH...

06:48.368 --> 06:49.949
WHY DON'T WE JUST GO WITH PINK?

06:49.950 --> 06:52.161
- PINK'S TERRIBLE!
- NO, NO ONE USES PINK.

06:52.162 --> 06:53.583
WELL, WHATEVER. WHAT DO I KNOW?

06:53.584 --> 06:54.954
JOE, LOOK, IT'S
YOUR WEDDING TOO.

06:54.955 --> 06:56.085
OKAY, WHY DON'T YOU JUST SAY

06:56.086 --> 06:59.459
WHAT YOU HONESTLY PREFER?
WHITE OR RED?

06:59.460 --> 07:01.090
THERE'S NO WRONG ANSWER.

07:01.091 --> 07:02.712
OH, OKAY.

07:02.713 --> 07:04.805
- WELL THEN, RED.
- ARE YOU FRICKIN' KIDDING ME?!

07:06.176 --> 07:07.427
SHE'LL COME AROUND.

07:15.556 --> 07:17.727
HOW COULD YOU CHOOSE
YOUR MOTHER OVER ME?

07:17.728 --> 07:19.108
YOU ASKED WHAT I
HONESTLY PREFERRED!

07:19.109 --> 07:20.060
DON'T YOU KNOW A TRICK QUESTION

07:20.061 --> 07:21.400
WHEN YOU HEAR ONE?

07:21.401 --> 07:22.822
HONEY, YOU SHOULDN'T
BE GETTING THIS UPSET

07:22.823 --> 07:25.064
- ABOUT RED TABLECLOTH.
- WHITE TABLECLOTHS!

07:25.065 --> 07:26.026
ALL RIGHT! WHITE! I LOVE WHITE!

07:26.027 --> 07:27.366
I THINK WHITE'S AMAZING! LISTEN,

07:27.367 --> 07:28.568
THE FIRST THING WE NEED TO DO

07:28.569 --> 07:30.239
IS GET MY MOM FAR,
FAR AWAY FROM YOU.

07:30.240 --> 07:31.951
- ON BOARD.
- OKAY.

07:31.952 --> 07:33.533
SO WE NEED TO COME UP WITH
SOMETHING FOR HER TO DO.

07:33.534 --> 07:35.535
I WAS THINKING ABOUT
IT, ALL RIGHT.

07:35.536 --> 07:36.706
A COUPLE DAYS AGO,
YOU CAME TO ME.

07:36.707 --> 07:38.167
YOU SAID THAT YOU NARROWED DOWN

07:38.168 --> 07:39.458
THE PHOTOGRAPHERS
TO FIVE CHOICES.

07:39.459 --> 07:40.920
AND YOU LOVE THEM ALL, RIGHT?

07:40.921 --> 07:43.382
- SHE'S NOT GONE YET.
- I'M WORKING ON IT!

07:43.383 --> 07:45.004
I'M WORKING ON IT. LISTEN TO ME.

07:45.005 --> 07:46.345
LET HER CHOOSE THE PHOTOGRAPHER.

07:46.346 --> 07:47.967
OKAY? THIS WAY, SHE'LL
THINK SHE'S DOING

07:47.968 --> 07:49.969
SOMETHING VERY IMPORTANT.
INSTEAD OF JUST

07:49.970 --> 07:51.591
THE TIME-CONSUMING BUSYWORK THAT

07:51.592 --> 07:52.682
THAT ACTUALLY IS.

07:52.683 --> 07:55.595
OOH, YOU ARE AN EVIL GENIUS.

07:55.596 --> 07:58.688
OH, AND IN THREE WEEKS I WILL BE MRS.
EVIL GENIUS.

07:58.689 --> 07:59.899
BUT MAYBE I SHOULD HYPHEN IT,

07:59.900 --> 08:02.312
YOU KNOW,
BURKE-LONGO-EVIL GENIUS.

08:05.105 --> 08:07.276
AND THAT'S WHY SELECTING
THE PHOTOGRAPHER

08:07.277 --> 08:09.949
IS A VITALLY IMPORTANT TASK.

08:09.950 --> 08:11.571
BUT SHOULDN'T I
BE THERE WITH YOU

08:11.572 --> 08:13.372
FOR THE REALLY
IMPORTANT DECISIONS,

08:13.373 --> 08:16.455
LIKE CHOOSING THE DOILIES
OR TASTING THE CRAB CAKES?

08:16.456 --> 08:18.167
MOM, COME ON. IN 50 YEARS,

08:18.168 --> 08:20.169
ARE PEOPLE STILL GONNA BE
TALKING ABOUT THE DOILIES? NO.

08:20.170 --> 08:21.791
ARE THEY GONNA BE
TASTING THE CRAB CAKES?

08:21.792 --> 08:23.082
GOD, I HOPE NOT.

08:23.083 --> 08:24.123
NO, MOM, THEY'RE GONNA
BE TALKING ABOUT

08:24.124 --> 08:25.424
THE PHOTOGRAPHS.
YOU KNOW WHY, MOM?

08:25.425 --> 08:28.888
BECAUSE THE PHOTOGRAPHS,
THEY LAST FOREVER.

08:28.889 --> 08:31.841
THAT'S JUST BEAUTIFUL.
ALL RIGHT.

08:31.842 --> 08:33.803
YOU NEED ME.

08:33.804 --> 08:35.555
- I'LL DO IT.
- OH, MOM, LISTEN.

08:35.556 --> 08:36.896
TAKE YOUR TIME WHEN
YOU'RE CHOOSING

08:36.897 --> 08:38.017
THESE PHOTOGRAPHERS
NOW, ALL RIGHT?

08:38.018 --> 08:39.559
INTERVIEW EACH GUY
TWICE IF YOU HAVE TO.

08:39.560 --> 08:41.310
THREE TIMES, 'CAUSE
ANY JOB WORTH DOING

08:41.311 --> 08:44.354
IS WORTH DOING SLOWLY.

08:48.028 --> 08:50.069
BIG SISTER TO THE RESCUE.

08:50.070 --> 08:51.530
I HAVE A PLAN TO GET
YOU INTO COLLEGE.

08:51.531 --> 08:53.202
STIMPSON AND PLAKARD COLLEGE.

08:53.203 --> 08:55.454
THEIR MOTTO IS "WE MAY NOT
BE YOUR FIRST CHOICE,

08:55.455 --> 08:58.207
BUT, HEY, YOU GOT IN."

08:58.208 --> 09:00.079
AND THEY ACCEPT
LATE APPLICATIONS

09:00.080 --> 09:01.041
FOR SPECIAL CASES.

09:01.042 --> 09:02.251
WHAT'S MY SPECIAL CASE?

09:02.252 --> 09:03.292
YOU'RE AN IDIOT.

09:03.293 --> 09:05.164
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO

09:05.165 --> 09:07.627
IS WRITE AN ESSAY OF WHY YOU
CHOSE "S AND P" COLLEGE.

09:07.628 --> 09:09.168
OH, THAT'S EASY.

09:09.169 --> 09:10.509
'CAUSE MY PUSHY SISTER

09:10.510 --> 09:12.471
FILLED OUT AN APPLICATION
WHEN I TOLD HER NOT TO.

09:12.472 --> 09:14.634
WELL, ACTUALLY, THAT'LL
PROBABLY GET YOU IN,

09:14.635 --> 09:16.385
BUT I WOULD ADD A FEW PARAGRAPHS

09:16.386 --> 09:17.977
JUST IN CASE.

09:17.978 --> 09:19.979
I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU'RE
WORRIED ABOUT MY FUTURE,

09:19.980 --> 09:21.140
BUT DON'T WORRY. ALL RIGHT?

09:21.141 --> 09:22.602
I HAVE A PLAN.

09:22.603 --> 09:24.393
I JUST... I CAN'T TELL
YOU ABOUT IT YET.

09:24.394 --> 09:26.606
OH, YOU HAVE A SECRET PLAN?

09:26.607 --> 09:28.948
DO YOU WEAR TIGHTS
AND FIGHT CRIME?

09:28.949 --> 09:30.820
YOU KNOW WHAT? I'M NOT
EVEN GONNA DIGNIFY THAT

09:30.821 --> 09:32.401
WITH A RESPONSE,

09:32.402 --> 09:33.654
BUT DON'T LOOK IN MY CLOSET.

09:36.697 --> 09:38.958
HEY, YOU WANT TO LOOK OVER THE
PLAYLIST FOR THE D.J. AGAIN?

09:38.959 --> 09:40.249
YOU DIDN'T SNEAK
"I LIKE BIG BUTTS"

09:40.250 --> 09:41.250
BACK ON THERE AGAIN, RIGHT?

09:41.251 --> 09:43.122
WHAT? NO.

09:43.123 --> 09:44.875
( clicking )

09:46.757 --> 09:47.967
OH, THIS ALL FEELS SO GOOD.

09:47.968 --> 09:50.089
THE LAST 24 HOURS
HAVE BEEN GLORIA-FREE

09:50.090 --> 09:52.051
AND I'VE BEEN ABLE TO
DO EVERYTHING MYSELF.

09:52.052 --> 09:53.262
- WHAT?
- OURSELF!

09:53.263 --> 09:57.056
I HAVE DONE
EVERYTHING "OURSELF."

09:57.057 --> 09:58.097
YOU KNOW, SPEAKING OF MY MOM,

09:58.098 --> 09:59.598
I'M ACTUALLY GONNA
GO CHECK ON HER.

09:59.599 --> 10:01.350
I WANT TO SEE HOW THE
PHOTOGRAPHER SEARCH IS COMING.

10:01.351 --> 10:03.482
MAKE SURE SHE'S NOT
MAKING TOO MUCH PROGRESS.

10:03.483 --> 10:05.104
MOM, HEY.

10:05.105 --> 10:08.107
JOEY, TASTE THIS AND
TELL ME IT'S PERFECT.

10:08.108 --> 10:09.899
OKAY.

10:09.900 --> 10:11.861
YOU KNOW WHAT, MOM?
THAT IS PERFECT.

10:11.862 --> 10:13.993
LIKE I DIDN'T KNOW THAT.

10:13.994 --> 10:16.155
SO HOW'S THE PHOTOGRAPHER
SEARCH COMING?

10:16.156 --> 10:17.616
I BOOKED A GUY.

10:17.617 --> 10:18.948
BUT NOT ONE OF YOUR CHOICES.

10:18.949 --> 10:20.830
SOMEONE BETTER AND CHEAPER.

10:20.831 --> 10:23.162
- YOUR BROTHER TONY.
- WHAT?! MOM!

10:23.163 --> 10:25.164
NO, HE'S NOT WELCOME HERE.

10:25.165 --> 10:27.246
OF COURSE HE IS.
HE'S YOUR BROTHER.

10:27.247 --> 10:29.128
MOM, LOOK, IT'S... IT'S
NOT EVEN ABOUT ME.

10:29.129 --> 10:30.129
IT'S MORE ABOUT MY BRIDE-TO-BE.

10:30.130 --> 10:31.130
OKAY, OKAY, LISTEN.

10:31.131 --> 10:32.251
TWO YEARS AGO TONY WAS HERE.

10:32.252 --> 10:33.923
I DIDN'T WANT TO HAVE
TO TELL YOU THIS,

10:33.924 --> 10:36.015
BUT HE HIT ON MEL.

10:36.016 --> 10:39.138
OH, THAT'S WHAT HE DOES.

10:39.139 --> 10:41.891
MOM, HE TALKED HER INTO
TAKING HER CLOTHES OFF

10:41.892 --> 10:43.102
AND THEN HE TOOK PICTURES OF HER

10:43.103 --> 10:45.064
AND POSTED 'EM ON
HIS SKEEZY WEBSITE.

10:45.065 --> 10:46.355
THAT IS, LIKE, INEXCUSABLE.

10:46.356 --> 10:49.068
MEL WASN'T EVEN YOUR
GIRLFRIEND TWO YEARS AGO.

10:49.069 --> 10:51.190
BOY, SHE REALLY MADE
YOU WORK FOR IT.

10:51.191 --> 10:53.442
SMART GIRL.

10:53.443 --> 10:55.364
LOOK, IT DOESN'T EVEN
MATTER WHAT I THINK, OKAY?

10:55.365 --> 10:56.866
BECAUSE WHEN SHE HEARS THIS,

10:56.867 --> 10:58.037
MEL IS GONNA HIT THE ROOF.

10:58.038 --> 10:59.328
UH, WHY AM I GONNA HIT THE ROOF?

10:59.329 --> 11:01.370
HONEY, STAY CALM.

11:01.371 --> 11:05.124
MY MOTHER DIDN'T CHOOSE ANY OF THE
PHOTOGRAPHERS FROM YOUR LIST.

11:05.125 --> 11:07.126
SHE WENT ROGUE. ALL RIGHT.
SHE...

11:07.127 --> 11:08.999
SHE HIRED MY BROTHER TONY.

11:10.751 --> 11:12.461
THAT'S A GREAT IDEA.

11:12.462 --> 11:13.793
YOU SEE HOW PISSED
OFF YOU JUST...

11:13.794 --> 11:15.054
WAIT A MINUTE! WHAT?!

11:15.055 --> 11:17.006
NO, NO! AFTER WHAT HE DID
TO YOU THE LAST TIME,

11:17.007 --> 11:19.258
- HE'S NOT WELCOME HERE.
- HE'S A WONDERFUL PHOTOGRAPHER.

11:19.259 --> 11:20.509
HE TOOK BEAUTIFUL
PICTURES OF ME.

11:20.510 --> 11:22.972
- HALF NAKED!
- UGH, IT ALL ENDED WELL.

11:22.973 --> 11:25.725
- UH, AFTER A FISTFIGHT!
- OVER ME.

11:25.726 --> 11:27.516
WHICH YOU WON.

11:27.517 --> 11:29.688
OH, JOEY, IT'S GONNA BE FINE.

11:29.689 --> 11:31.190
LISTEN TO YOUR FIANCEE.

11:31.191 --> 11:32.361
THANK YOU, GLORIA.

11:32.362 --> 11:33.612
I'M GONNA GO CALL TONY.

11:33.613 --> 11:35.194
HE SAID HE'D BE HERE BY DINNER.

11:35.195 --> 11:38.027
AND TOMORROW, HE'LL TAKE
YOUR ENGAGEMENT PICTURES.

11:38.028 --> 11:39.780
JOEY, WATCH THE SAUCE.

11:42.993 --> 11:45.825
I CANNOT BELIEVE YOU JUST
CHOSE MY MOTHER OVER ME.

11:45.826 --> 11:47.877
OH, I GUESS THE PINK TABLECLOTH

11:47.878 --> 11:49.628
IS ON THE OTHER FOOT NOW, HUH?

11:49.629 --> 11:52.001
YEAH, I'M GONNA LAY DOWN
THE LAW WITH MY MOM.

11:52.002 --> 11:53.422
ALL RIGHT, TONY'S
NOT SETTING FOOT

11:53.423 --> 11:54.713
INSIDE THIS HOUSE.

11:54.714 --> 11:55.965
I GOT TO SAY,

11:55.966 --> 11:57.137
I WAS SURPRISED TO BE INVITED.

11:59.179 --> 12:00.931
YOU WEREN'T THE ONLY ONE, TONY.

12:08.058 --> 12:10.479
SO, RYDER, YOU'RE A
SENIOR NOW, HUH?

12:10.480 --> 12:12.351
- MM-HMM.
- HOW'S IT GOING WITH THE LADIES?

12:12.352 --> 12:14.193
YOU KNOW, I'M ACTUALLY
HAVING A PRETTY GOOD YEAR.

12:14.194 --> 12:15.614
JUST WAIT TILL YOU GET
TO COLLEGE, BUDDY.

12:15.615 --> 12:16.906
IF YOU'RE LIKE ME,

12:16.907 --> 12:19.029
IT'LL BE THE BEST SIX
YEARS OF YOUR LIFE.

12:20.280 --> 12:21.821
SO THE ACCEPTANCES ROLLING IN?

12:21.822 --> 12:23.162
- ( scoffs )
- OH, UH...

12:23.163 --> 12:25.414
WHO WANTS TO TALK ABOUT
BORING, OLD COLLEGE

12:25.415 --> 12:27.867
WHEN THERE IS A BIG-ASS
WEDDING HAPPENING?

12:27.868 --> 12:30.249
YOU KNOW, YOU'VE GOT BRIDES.
YOU'VE GOT GROOMS.

12:30.250 --> 12:32.251
- YOU'VE GOT HEARTFELT TOASTS.
- OH, YEAH, YEAH.

12:32.252 --> 12:33.292
I, UH... I GOT ONE.

12:33.293 --> 12:35.335
TO MY BROTHER JOE...

12:36.756 --> 12:38.048
I GUESS YOU'RE NOT
THE NANNY ANYMORE.

12:40.220 --> 12:41.380
FINALLY CRAWLED OUT
OF THE BASEMENT

12:41.381 --> 12:42.932
INTO THE LANDLADY'S BEDROOM.

12:42.933 --> 12:44.643
CHEERS.

12:44.644 --> 12:46.555
( forced ) HA HA HA HA!

12:46.556 --> 12:49.098
THAT'S FUNNY. THAT'S FUNNY.

12:49.099 --> 12:50.229
TONY, CAN I SHOW YOU SOMETHING

12:50.230 --> 12:51.440
IN THE LIVING ROOM JUST
REAL QUICK, PLEASE?

12:51.441 --> 12:53.192
OH, YEAH, SURE.

12:53.193 --> 12:56.065
RYDER, YOU SPILLED
SAUCE EVERYWHERE.

12:56.066 --> 12:58.397
BET YOU WISH YOU HAD
A RED TABLECLOTH

12:58.398 --> 13:00.110
RIGHT ABOUT NOW, HUH?

13:02.032 --> 13:05.204
SO, UH, WHAT'D YOU
WANT TO SHOW ME?

13:05.205 --> 13:07.246
THE DOOR.

13:07.247 --> 13:09.038
YEAH, 'CAUSE IF YOU DON'T START

13:09.039 --> 13:10.169
SHOWING MEL AND ME A
LITTLE MORE RESPECT,

13:10.170 --> 13:12.001
THAT'S WHERE YOU'RE
GONNA BE HEADED.

13:12.002 --> 13:14.173
SO WHAT? IF I SAY THE WRONG
THING, YOU'RE GONNA KICK ME OUT?

13:14.174 --> 13:16.045
YEAH, THAT'S IT.

13:16.046 --> 13:17.586
WELL, I MEAN, IT COULD
BE TOUGH TO KNOW

13:17.587 --> 13:19.048
IF WHAT I'M SAYING
IS THE WRONG THING.

13:19.049 --> 13:20.589
I MEAN, WHAT IF I MAKE
AN INNOCENT COMMENT

13:20.590 --> 13:22.181
ABOUT HOW ALL YOUR GIRLFRIENDS

13:22.182 --> 13:23.843
DATED YOU TO GET TO ME?

13:23.844 --> 13:26.135
I MEAN, WOULD THAT
BE THE WRONG THING?

13:26.136 --> 13:29.018
THAT COULD BE ONE.

13:29.019 --> 13:30.099
YOU KNOW WHAT ANOTHER
ONE COULD BE

13:30.100 --> 13:32.231
IS LISTING ANY MORE.

13:32.232 --> 13:35.064
ALL RIGHT, YOU KNOW,
I'M STILL NOT CLEAR.

13:35.065 --> 13:37.196
I MEAN, WHAT IF I SAID,

13:37.197 --> 13:39.698
MEL WAS MORE ATTRACTED
TO A CERTAIN

13:39.699 --> 13:40.779
BROTHER OF YOURS?

13:40.780 --> 13:42.781
TONY, PLEASE. YOU
KNOW, COME ON, MAN.

13:42.782 --> 13:44.113
FOR THE SAKE OF YOUR
FACE AND MY KNUCKLES,

13:44.114 --> 13:46.035
WILL YOU JUST STOP TALKING?

13:46.036 --> 13:47.826
OKAY, OKAY, I GET IT.

13:47.827 --> 13:50.709
SHE PICKED YOU. YOU WON, I LOST.

13:50.710 --> 13:52.621
YOU WERE IN TOWN.

13:52.622 --> 13:53.792
I WASN'T AVAILABLE.

13:53.793 --> 13:55.084
THAT'S IT! COME HERE!

13:55.085 --> 13:56.585
COME HERE! THAT'S IT!

13:56.586 --> 13:58.047
BOYS! BOYS! YOU CAN'T GET

13:58.048 --> 14:00.669
THROUGH ONE MEAL
WITHOUT FIGHTING?!

14:00.670 --> 14:02.511
HE STARTED IT!

14:02.512 --> 14:03.842
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

14:03.843 --> 14:06.135
DON'T FIGHT NEAR MY COUCH.
THAT'S SUEDE.

14:06.136 --> 14:08.057
THIS IS ALL MY FAULT.

14:08.058 --> 14:11.060
I INVITED TONY AND
EXPECTED FAMILY HARMONY,

14:11.061 --> 14:12.851
WHICH WAS CLEARLY TOO
MUCH TO HOPE FOR.

14:12.852 --> 14:15.354
SO I'M GONNA LEAVE BEFORE
I DO ANY MORE DAMAGE.

14:15.355 --> 14:16.775
I'LL GO PACK RIGHT NOW.

14:16.776 --> 14:18.857
- MOM!
- NO, I'LL JUST LEAVE MY THINGS.

14:18.858 --> 14:20.439
I DON'T DESERVE THEM.

14:20.440 --> 14:21.860
MOM, WAIT A MINUTE.
WAIT A MINUTE.

14:21.861 --> 14:24.905
LOOK, LOOK, WE'LL... WE'LL
STOP FIGHTING, OKAY?

14:26.156 --> 14:28.118
TONY CAN...

14:30.200 --> 14:31.121
( forced ) STAY.

14:33.083 --> 14:35.374
GOOD BOY. GO HUG
YOUR BROTHER, JOEY.

14:35.375 --> 14:37.377
- MOM, I DON'T WANT TO.
- HUG HIM!

14:38.378 --> 14:40.259
LISTEN TO YOUR MOTHER, JOE.

14:40.260 --> 14:41.711
I DON'T...

14:45.635 --> 14:47.056
I JUST... ALL RIGHT, I WILL...

14:47.057 --> 14:48.387
COME ON.

14:48.388 --> 14:49.848
COME ON, GET IN HERE.

14:49.849 --> 14:51.770
ALL RIGHT. OH, THAT'S GOOD.

14:51.771 --> 14:53.183
OKAY.

14:54.434 --> 14:56.225
OH MY GOD,

14:56.226 --> 14:58.478
SO MUCH HANDSOME CAME OUT OF ME.

15:01.651 --> 15:04.153
( children cheering )

15:04.154 --> 15:05.945
ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT.
WHO'S THE GAME MASTER?

15:05.946 --> 15:08.447
- Boy: YOU ARE!
- Ryder: YEAH!

15:08.448 --> 15:10.449
AND THE GAME MASTER SAYS
THAT THERE IS PIZZA READY

15:10.450 --> 15:12.992
IN THE HEROES LAIR, ALSO
KNOWN AS BIRTHDAY ROOM A.

15:12.993 --> 15:14.163
( cheering )

15:14.164 --> 15:15.494
EVERYBODY, EVERYBODY,

15:15.495 --> 15:16.835
SINCE IT'S LIAM'S BIRTHDAY,

15:16.836 --> 15:18.707
HE LEADS, OKAY?
EVERYBODY FOLLOW HIM.

15:18.708 --> 15:21.040
- IS THAT ALL RIGHT, LIAM?
- FOLLOW ME, EVERYBODY!

15:21.041 --> 15:22.882
( cheering )

15:24.214 --> 15:26.135
WOW, YOU HAVE THE WORST
JOB IN THE WORLD.

15:26.136 --> 15:28.047
YOU KIDDING? I LOVE THIS.

15:28.048 --> 15:30.219
I GET CAKE LIKE SIX TIMES A DAY.

15:30.220 --> 15:31.680
SO WHAT'S UP?

15:31.681 --> 15:33.892
I WANTED YOUR COLLEGE ESSAY
TO BE AT LEAST SEMI-LITERATE.

15:33.893 --> 15:35.604
SO I WROTE IT.

15:35.605 --> 15:36.935
NOW READ IT SO WE
CAN SEND IT IN,

15:36.936 --> 15:38.727
YOU KNOW, IN CASE YOUR SECRET
PLAN DOESN'T WORK OUT.

15:38.728 --> 15:40.359
- FINE.
- SCANLON.

15:40.360 --> 15:42.191
I HAD A CALL FROM MRS. HOROWITZ.

15:42.192 --> 15:43.942
SHE WAS EXTREMELY HAPPY

15:43.943 --> 15:45.444
WITH HOW YOU HANDLED
ADAM'S BIRTHDAY.

15:45.445 --> 15:46.565
ADAM'S A GREAT KID.

15:46.566 --> 15:48.277
ADAM'S THE DEVIL'S SPAWN

15:48.278 --> 15:49.658
WHO'LL BLOW UP A BRIDGE ONE DAY.

15:49.659 --> 15:51.870
BUT THIS MAKES MY DECISION EASY.

15:51.871 --> 15:53.832
YOU ARE THE NEW
SATURDAY MANAGER.

15:53.833 --> 15:54.994
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

15:54.995 --> 15:56.125
THANKS, BOSS.

15:56.126 --> 15:57.876
YOU GET A RAISE, YOUR
OWN SET OF KEYS,

15:57.877 --> 16:00.039
AND I'M GONNA TRAIN YOU
HOW TO DO BANK DEPOSITS.

16:00.040 --> 16:02.211
YOU'RE TRUSTING HIM
WITH ACTUAL MONEY?

16:02.212 --> 16:03.542
SCANLON, YOU EARNED IT.

16:03.543 --> 16:06.256
THE LASER TAG BUSINESS
NEEDS GO-GETTERS LIKE YOU.

16:07.887 --> 16:09.468
THAT'S MY PLAN.

16:09.469 --> 16:13.143
GOD, I'M LIKE MOSES, BUT
WITH MORE RESPONSIBILITY.

16:14.264 --> 16:16.435
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA. YOU'RE
GIVING UP COLLEGE

16:16.436 --> 16:18.687
TO BE THE SATURDAY
LASER TAG MANAGER?

16:18.688 --> 16:20.309
HEY, I'M GREAT WITH KIDS, OKAY?

16:20.310 --> 16:23.192
AND THE BIRTHDAY PARTY BUSINESS
IS A GROWING INDUSTRY, LENNOX.

16:23.193 --> 16:26.235
I'M JUST... I'M
JUST RIDING A WAVE.

16:26.236 --> 16:28.367
SO CAN WE DROP IT

16:28.368 --> 16:30.030
ABOUT THE WHOLE COLLEGE THING?

16:31.111 --> 16:34.283
WELL, THIS ISN'T EXACTLY
WHAT I PICTURED FOR YOU,

16:34.284 --> 16:36.285
BUT YOU FOUND SOMETHING
YOU'RE PASSIONATE ABOUT

16:36.286 --> 16:38.667
SO I HAVE TO RESPECT THAT.

16:38.668 --> 16:40.379
THANK YOU FOR FINALLY
UNDERSTANDING

16:40.380 --> 16:42.121
THE WORK I DO HERE IS IMPORTANT.

16:42.122 --> 16:45.214
SCANLON, SOME KID PUKED
ON THE AIR HOCKEY TABLE.

16:45.215 --> 16:46.295
OH, I'M ON IT.

16:46.296 --> 16:48.838
AS A MATTER OF FACT,
I'M ALL OVER IT.

16:51.131 --> 16:53.843
I WISH I HAD 10 MORE LIKE HIM.

16:56.226 --> 16:58.187
OH, THAT'S GREAT, GUYS.

16:58.188 --> 16:59.188
IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

16:59.189 --> 17:00.689
OKAY, NOW, MEL,

17:00.690 --> 17:02.231
WHY DON'T YOU PUT
YOUR ARM AROUND JOE?

17:02.232 --> 17:03.312
YOU KNOW, LIKE YOU
ACTUALLY LIKE HIM.

17:03.313 --> 17:05.694
( laughs )

17:05.695 --> 17:08.277
- SHE LIKES ME JUST FINE.
- WELL, I DON'T KNOW.

17:08.278 --> 17:10.028
OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT?
WE'RE GOOD HERE.

17:10.029 --> 17:11.240
WHY DON'T WE HEAD
OVER TO THE PARK?

17:11.241 --> 17:12.951
ACTUALLY, YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'M SORT OF TIRED

17:12.952 --> 17:14.413
OF THE WHOLE CLICKITY-CLICK.

17:14.414 --> 17:16.325
WHAT? THE PARK, IT'LL BE A
REALLY GREAT BACKGROUND.

17:16.326 --> 17:17.996
I DON'T REALLY THINK IT'S
THAT GREAT OF A BACKGROUND.

17:17.997 --> 17:19.958
OOH, IT'S PRETTY GOOD.
LOT OF GOOD ANGLES.

17:19.959 --> 17:21.710
YEAH, YOU WANT A GOOD ANGLE?

17:21.711 --> 17:24.042
WHY DON'T YOU TAKE
A SHOT OF MY BUTT

17:24.043 --> 17:25.795
SAYING "BYE-BYE."

17:27.167 --> 17:28.167
HEY, I'M SORRY.

17:28.168 --> 17:29.298
HE'S BEEN A LITTLE STRESSED OUT

17:29.299 --> 17:30.719
ABOUT THIS WEDDING, BUT UH...

17:30.720 --> 17:32.551
I BET YOU'D BE PSYCHED
TO MARRY ME, RIGHT?

17:32.552 --> 17:34.093
YEAH, FOR SURE.

17:34.094 --> 17:35.224
HEY, DON'T WORRY ABOUT
JOE, ALL RIGHT?

17:35.225 --> 17:37.055
HE'S BEEN CLENCHED
HIS WHOLE LIFE.

17:37.056 --> 17:39.057
I THINK THAT'S WHY EVERYONE SAYS

17:39.058 --> 17:41.100
- I'M THE LIKABLE ONE.
- OH, YOU ARE PRETTY LIKABLE.

17:41.101 --> 17:43.602
YEAH, I'M LIKE A
PUPPY, A SEXY PUPPY.

17:43.603 --> 17:45.184
( laughs )

17:45.185 --> 17:47.146
HEY, WHY DON'T I TOUCH
UP THESE PHOTOS?

17:47.147 --> 17:48.357
AND YOU CAN COME BY
IN A COUPLE HOURS

17:48.358 --> 17:49.988
- AND SEE WHAT WE GOT.
- GREAT.

17:49.989 --> 17:51.280
- OKAY, I CAN'T WAIT.
- OKAY.

17:51.281 --> 17:53.572
OH, UM, CAN YOU...
COULD... LIKE...

17:53.573 --> 17:56.195
MAKE YOU TWO SHADES TANNER,
A CUP SIZE LARGER,

17:56.196 --> 17:57.536
AND TEETH AS BRILLIANT
AS THE SUN.

17:57.537 --> 17:59.958
- HOW DID YOU KNOW?
- IT'S THE BRIDE-TO-BE SPECIAL.

17:59.959 --> 18:01.330
YOU WON'T EVEN
RECOGNIZE YOURSELF.

18:01.331 --> 18:02.461
OH, I WILL.

18:02.462 --> 18:04.624
THAT'S HOW I PICTURE
MYSELF IN MY MIND.

18:07.377 --> 18:09.298
WOW, THESE PHOTOS ARE AMAZING.

18:09.299 --> 18:12.711
I MEAN, YOU CAN BARELY TELL
HOW IMPATIENT JOE WAS.

18:12.712 --> 18:14.513
YEAH, PHOTOSHOP'S GOT
A GREAT NEW TOOL

18:14.514 --> 18:17.055
- CALLED "GROUCH REMOVER."
- ( laughs )

18:17.056 --> 18:18.677
YOU KNOW, IT'S SO GREAT
THAT YOU COULD COME.

18:18.678 --> 18:20.429
YOU KNOW, I'M KIND OF THINKING

18:20.430 --> 18:22.060
MAYBE IT WAS YOUR IDEA
TO BRING ME HERE.

18:22.061 --> 18:24.062
WELL, I HAVE TO CONFESS.

18:24.063 --> 18:25.224
I WASN'T AGAINST IT.

18:25.225 --> 18:28.437
SO ARE YOU READY
TO TAKE THE PLUNGE

18:28.438 --> 18:30.068
AND SETTLE DOWN INTO
BORING, OLD MARRIED LIFE?

18:30.069 --> 18:31.690
HEY, I'M NOT MARRIED YET.

18:31.691 --> 18:33.282
I THINK THERE'S STILL
A WILD TIME OR TWO

18:33.283 --> 18:36.034
LEFT IN THIS TIGRESS. MEOW.

18:36.035 --> 18:37.996
- OH, YEAH?
- OH, YEAH.

18:37.997 --> 18:40.869
OH, HEY, UM, SINCE
JOE'S NOT HERE,

18:40.870 --> 18:42.831
THERE'S SOMETHING
I WANT YOU TO DO.

18:42.832 --> 18:44.002
OH, I'M LISTENING.

18:44.003 --> 18:45.204
OKAY, WELL, WE HAVE
TO KEEP IT A SECRET.

18:45.205 --> 18:46.505
HEY, I LOVE SECRETS.

18:46.506 --> 18:47.876
- DON'T GO ANYWHERE.
- OKAY.

18:47.877 --> 18:49.878
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH
EVERYTHING WE NEED.

18:49.879 --> 18:51.089
I'LL BE HERE.

18:51.090 --> 18:52.881
I THOUGHT YOU COULD
MAKE A SLIDE SHOW

18:52.882 --> 18:54.173
OUT OF ALL THESE OLD PHOTOS.

18:54.174 --> 18:56.675
OH, TONY!

18:56.676 --> 18:58.136
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!

18:58.137 --> 18:59.678
WELL, THIS IS WHAT
YOU WANTED, RIGHT?

18:59.679 --> 19:00.889
TO GO A LITTLE WILD?

19:00.890 --> 19:03.392
NO, HOW COULD YOU THINK THAT?

19:03.393 --> 19:06.104
BUT I THOUGHT...

19:06.105 --> 19:07.976
OH, THIS IS AWKWARD.

19:07.977 --> 19:09.027
Gloria: TONY, HONEY,
I MADE YOU...

19:09.028 --> 19:10.689
HOLY CANNOLI!

19:10.690 --> 19:12.442
PUT THAT AWAY!

19:14.073 --> 19:15.984
IT WAS AN HONEST
MISUNDERSTANDING.

19:15.985 --> 19:17.155
I'M A GOOD GUY.

19:17.156 --> 19:19.157
YEAH, YOU'RE THE BEST.
NOW PLEASE GET OUT

19:19.158 --> 19:20.619
BEFORE JOE COMES
HOME AND KILLS YOU.

19:20.620 --> 19:21.660
I DON'T WANT TO
BE A PRISON WIFE.

19:21.661 --> 19:23.121
I NEED MORE THAN
ONE CONJUGAL VISIT

19:23.122 --> 19:24.453
EVERY SIX MONTHS.

19:24.454 --> 19:26.495
THIS WASN'T MY FAULT, ALL RIGHT?

19:26.496 --> 19:28.126
SHE WAS GIVING ME VERY
MISLEADING SIGNALS.

19:28.127 --> 19:31.290
WELL, SHE'S GIVING YOU A
VERY CLEAR SIGNAL NOW.

19:31.291 --> 19:34.133
GET THE HELL OUT!

19:35.925 --> 19:38.177
- BYE, MOM, I LOVE YOU.
- TAKE CARE, SWEETHEART.

19:40.139 --> 19:43.222
WE WILL NEVER SPEAK
OF THIS AGAIN.

19:43.223 --> 19:45.934
WE WON'T TELL JOEY
WHAT ALMOST HAPPENED.

19:45.935 --> 19:47.226
IT DIDN'T ALMOST HAPPEN.

19:47.227 --> 19:49.067
TONY'S VERY APPEALING.

19:49.068 --> 19:50.359
NO ONE WOULD BLAME YOU.

19:50.360 --> 19:52.731
NO ONE WOULD BLAME ME
BECAUSE NOTHING HAPPENED.

19:52.732 --> 19:54.022
OKAY, WE'LL GO WITH THAT STORY.

19:54.023 --> 19:57.075
BUT THE IMPORTANT THING
IS JOEY DOESN'T KNOW

19:57.076 --> 19:59.117
AND A BLOODBATH WAS AVERTED.

19:59.118 --> 20:00.489
AWW, LOOK, WE'RE SHARING

20:00.490 --> 20:02.080
OUR FIRST DARK FAMILY SECRET.

20:02.081 --> 20:03.492
THE FIRST OF MANY, I HOPE.

20:03.493 --> 20:05.744
- ( giggles )
- THE FIRST OF MANY WHAT?

20:05.745 --> 20:07.165
OH, NOTHING.

20:07.166 --> 20:08.957
THERE ARE THINGS THAT A MOTHER

20:08.958 --> 20:10.038
AND HER DAUGHTER-IN-LAW SHARE

20:10.039 --> 20:11.251
THAT A SON SHOULD NEVER KNOW.

20:12.332 --> 20:14.594
AND A HUSBAND DOESN'T
NEED TO FIND OUT.

20:17.006 --> 20:19.177
( snickers )

20:19.178 --> 20:21.179
WHA...

20:21.180 --> 20:22.641
I THINK I LIKED IT BETTER

20:22.642 --> 20:24.643
WHEN YOU TWO WEREN'T
GETTING ALONG.

20:24.644 --> 20:26.516
( giggling )

20:29.479 --> 20:32.230
AND OVER HERE IS TABLE 14

20:32.231 --> 20:33.902
FOR ALL YOUR SINGLE FRIENDS.

20:33.903 --> 20:35.113
UP AT THE BAR, RIGHT
NEXT TO IT...

20:35.114 --> 20:37.276
THEY WON'T BE SINGLE FOR LONG.

20:37.277 --> 20:39.818
HOW COME TONY'S NOT
SITTING AT THAT TABLE?

20:39.819 --> 20:41.820
ACTUALLY,

20:41.821 --> 20:44.032
MOM, I DON'T SEE TONY
ANYWHERE ON THIS CHART.

20:44.033 --> 20:47.205
ACTUALLY, YOUR BROTHER
IS NOT GONNA BE THERE.

20:47.206 --> 20:48.127
WHAT? WHY?

20:48.128 --> 20:49.628
MY DECISION.

20:49.629 --> 20:51.209
I DIDN'T WANT A WRESTLING
MATCH AT THE WEDDING.

20:51.210 --> 20:52.791
MOM, THERE'S NOT GONNA
BE A WRESTLING MATCH.

20:52.792 --> 20:53.872
LISTEN, I'VE BEEN
THINKING A LOT ABOUT

20:53.873 --> 20:55.213
WHAT YOU TWO LADIES SAID.

20:55.214 --> 20:57.836
YOU KNOW, ABOUT NOT
WRITING OFF FAMILY,

20:57.837 --> 21:00.719
LEARNING TO FORGIVE. YES,
TONY DRIVES ME NUTS,

21:00.720 --> 21:01.930
BUT I LOVE HIM. HE'S MY BROTHER.

21:01.931 --> 21:03.512
AND I CAN'T GET MARRIED
WITHOUT HIM THERE.

21:03.513 --> 21:05.844
JOEY, YOU DON'T
KNOW WHAT HE DID.

21:05.845 --> 21:07.225
MOM, IT DOESN'T
MATTER WHAT HE DID.

21:07.226 --> 21:08.727
NOTHING HE COULD
POSSIBLY HAVE DONE

21:08.728 --> 21:10.268
WOULD CHANGE MY MIND ABOUT THAT.

21:10.269 --> 21:12.100
WHAT? WHAT?

21:12.101 --> 21:13.602
YEAH.

21:13.603 --> 21:15.605
HE DID...

21:18.237 --> 21:19.569
FULL CANNOLI?

21:22.902 --> 21:25.825
THAT'S GONNA TAKE A
LITTLE TIME TO GET OVER.
