00:01.293 --> 00:03.295
- Just let it go?
- No.

00:03.378 --> 00:06.340
Why wouldn't
l wanna go to the symphony?

00:06.423 --> 00:09.593
- l didn't mean anything by it.
- You meant something.

00:09.676 --> 00:12.638
- We've got to do something.
- No, we really don't.

00:12.721 --> 00:15.724
Carla's your girlfriend,
Elliot's my friend...

00:15.807 --> 00:18.060
Trust me. Don't get involved.

00:18.143 --> 00:20.938
<i>She's from el barrio,
she must not like music.</i>

00:21.021 --> 00:25.817
- Classical music isn't for everyone.
- So, l didn't have a nanny...

00:28.278 --> 00:30.405
You got something to say?

00:31.240 --> 00:35.786
l think you're being condescending
and you're being overly sensitive.

00:42.251 --> 00:45.128
Excuse me for a second,
just one second.

<i>She's from el barrio,
she won't like music.</i>

00:59.852 --> 01:05.399
- Classical music isn't for everyone.
- So, l didn't have a nanny...

01:07.109 --> 01:09.236
You got something to say?

01:09.319 --> 01:11.947
<i>Nope. Not this time.</i>

01:12.030 --> 01:17.578
l think you're being condescending
and you're being overly sensitive.

01:21.790 --> 01:23.500
Dammit!

01:47.691 --> 01:49.776
<i>Here's something surprising.</i>

01:49.860 --> 01:52.196
<i>On my first day,
my resident told me,</i>

01:52.279 --> 01:56.491
<i>if you don't count the maternity ward,
which is mostly well, you know,</i>

01:56.575 --> 01:58.660
<i>or the emergency room,</i>

01:58.744 --> 02:02.206
<i>which is mostly broken bones,
stitches, that sort of thing,</i>

02:02.289 --> 02:05.959
<i>he said that
one out of every three patients</i>

02:06.043 --> 02:09.463
<i>that's admitted to this place
will die here.</i>

02:10.714 --> 02:12.966
Hi, l'm gonna be your doctor.

02:13.050 --> 02:15.511
l'm the doctor.

02:17.137 --> 02:18.805
l'm the doctor.

02:18.889 --> 02:21.099
- What are you, 1 6?
- Unacceptable.

02:21.183 --> 02:23.477
Did you have coupons for this hospital?

02:23.560 --> 02:25.270
That's enough!

02:25.354 --> 02:29.274
Sure, he's young but he's
probably a very good doctor.

02:29.358 --> 02:32.611
- Are you a good doctor?
- Kinda too soon to tell.

02:32.694 --> 02:35.155
Honesty, l like that.

02:35.239 --> 02:37.991
You probably want
these people to wait outside.

02:38.075 --> 02:39.243
That'd be nice.

02:39.326 --> 02:41.745
Make 'em know
you're a man, not a boy.

02:41.828 --> 02:43.914
Would you guys mind...

02:43.997 --> 02:47.584
- l'm fine where l am, thank you.
- Make me.

02:47.668 --> 02:49.127
Do it.

02:49.211 --> 02:51.296
Everybody outta here, now!

02:51.380 --> 02:54.758
- No need to wake up the dead.
- Jeez, snippy.

02:54.842 --> 02:57.177
- Now!
- That was manly.

02:57.261 --> 02:59.888
That's what l'm talking about.

02:59.972 --> 03:02.474
- Want a hard candy?
- Yes, please.

03:04.101 --> 03:07.437
l'd say this is a simple
laparoscopic hernia repair.

03:07.521 --> 03:11.275
This is embarrassing, you guys
are wearing the same outfit.

03:11.358 --> 03:13.986
Don't sweat it.
l'm not wearing pants.

03:14.069 --> 03:16.071
Come on, that was funny.

03:16.154 --> 03:17.573
Great. Moving on.

03:17.656 --> 03:21.827
Where you going? ESPN Classic's
showing the '82 NFC championship.

03:21.910 --> 03:24.955
We could have some nurses over.

03:26.957 --> 03:30.669
l called down and requested
a Spanish-speaking nurse.

03:30.752 --> 03:34.089
No English, huh?

03:36.091 --> 03:39.094
l'm a chunky monkey
from funky town.

03:39.178 --> 03:44.433
- l'll have trouble translating that.
- Oh, good. lt's you.

03:46.435 --> 03:49.897
l admitted this
really neat old lady today.

03:50.814 --> 03:52.065
Neat?

03:52.149 --> 03:55.360
Dude, the 1 930s called
and they want their lingo back.

03:55.444 --> 03:57.738
We had this connection, you know?

03:57.821 --> 04:01.575
No, l don't know. Now please,
let me get my sweat on.

04:01.658 --> 04:05.287
<i>Surgeons generally don't like
to get too close to patients.</i>

04:05.370 --> 04:10.334
<i>Maybe it makes it harder
to cut someone open, or too risky.</i>

04:10.417 --> 04:13.212
l feel like you're missing out.
This Mrs Tanner,

04:13.295 --> 04:17.341
she's got this incredible
energy and warmth.

04:17.423 --> 04:19.551
The League of Women Voters called

04:19.635 --> 04:22.429
wanting to know
where to send your membership.

04:22.513 --> 04:24.848
You use that
''somebody called'' joke a lot.

04:24.932 --> 04:28.769
l can't help it.
l got a hernia patient to take care of.

04:28.852 --> 04:32.147
- What's his name?
- His name's Hernia Patient.

04:32.231 --> 04:34.608
But we've gotten close
so l call him Hernia.

04:34.691 --> 04:37.903
He must feel so safe
and taken care of.

04:37.986 --> 04:39.571
Shut up.

04:39.655 --> 04:42.699
l paged Dr Cox and
he should be here any second.

04:48.455 --> 04:50.249
What did she say?

04:50.332 --> 04:54.795
She says it's amazing your fancy
school didn't teach you Spanish,

04:54.878 --> 04:58.090
considering
a third of patients speak it.

04:58.173 --> 05:01.718
Like every doctor here speaks Spanish!

05:07.474 --> 05:08.809
What now, Dr Barbie?

05:08.892 --> 05:12.271
Mrs Guerrero is a lupus patient
with shortage of breath

05:12.354 --> 05:14.565
so l started her on a heparin drip.

05:14.648 --> 05:17.234
- l wanted to run that by you.
- One.

05:17.317 --> 05:18.861
Two.

05:18.944 --> 05:20.362
- Three.
- So, shall l...

05:20.445 --> 05:24.157
lt's really important
you let me get to ten.

05:24.241 --> 05:26.577
- l just thought...
- Listen, cookie.

05:26.660 --> 05:30.581
You've been here over a month.
This is Medicine 1 01 .

05:30.664 --> 05:33.083
l don't want everything run by me.

05:33.167 --> 05:36.879
l don't wanna give my two cents
but if you do want my opinion,

05:36.962 --> 05:41.091
rest assured it will always be
that you're an incredible pain

05:41.175 --> 05:43.886
and every time
l see your Kewpie-Doll face

05:43.969 --> 05:46.555
it just makes me want
to pick you up and shake you

05:46.638 --> 05:49.975
until all the hours
of my life that you've wasted

05:50.058 --> 05:52.352
fall out.

05:52.436 --> 05:54.146
- Now laugh.
- What?

05:54.229 --> 05:57.733
Laugh so that she doesn't
think l'm yelling at you.

06:04.364 --> 06:06.867
How fun was that?

06:06.950 --> 06:08.744
Just initial.

06:08.827 --> 06:13.624
Dr Kelso. l wonder if you could
give me your opinion on a patient?

06:13.707 --> 06:18.003
She's a 7 4-year-old renal failure,
Mrs Tanner.

06:18.086 --> 06:21.215
Of course.
One of our frequent flyers.

06:21.298 --> 06:23.675
- She's a neat lady.
- That's what l said.

06:23.759 --> 06:26.762
Nobody likes a brown nose, son.
Let me see that chart.

06:37.356 --> 06:38.398
Why?

06:42.945 --> 06:46.114
- You put her on diuretics?
- Yeah, l ordered them.

06:46.198 --> 06:51.286
These labs don't look good.
lt's time she got started on dialysis.

06:53.956 --> 06:56.708
You know what you should
do first, kiddo?

06:56.792 --> 07:00.003
- What's that?
- Find her.

07:05.133 --> 07:06.802
Freedom!

07:15.853 --> 07:18.647
''Went to the park.'' She...

07:19.815 --> 07:21.942
She went to the park.

07:23.861 --> 07:26.780
lt's the Catch.
l say ''Catch,'' no response.

07:26.864 --> 07:29.408
How can no one know what the Catch is?

07:29.491 --> 07:32.202
Niners-Cowboys.
Joe Montana to Dwight Clark,

07:32.286 --> 07:34.830
deep in the end zone,
zero time left.

07:34.913 --> 07:36.456
Don't insult me.

07:36.540 --> 07:39.084
lt's the fourth quarter.
Got a minute?

07:44.548 --> 07:47.092
- Sure.
- Cool.

07:47.176 --> 07:50.387
- David, right? l'm Turk.
- What's up?

07:50.470 --> 07:53.140
- Want some lV?
- No, l'm good.

07:58.353 --> 08:00.272
- Mrs Tanner.
- Here's the party.

08:00.355 --> 08:02.232
l don't know about others,

08:02.316 --> 08:05.944
but under my care, you stay in
hospital until l say it's OK to leave.

08:06.028 --> 08:08.155
We saved you a plate.

08:08.238 --> 08:10.449
l don't care about food right now.

08:10.532 --> 08:12.367
<i>Are those smores?</i>

08:12.451 --> 08:17.164
lt's Samantha's fifth birthday.
You're not gonna make me miss this?

08:18.165 --> 08:20.542
Couldn't you have got her a big cake?

08:22.419 --> 08:25.047
l'm gonna order an ABG
just to be safe.

08:25.130 --> 08:28.342
- Don't you think?
- That's probably a good idea.

08:28.425 --> 08:31.428
Teach me to tell her she's doing fine.

08:32.971 --> 08:34.139
Say...

08:38.227 --> 08:40.479
Mrs Guerrero?

08:47.194 --> 08:48.237
lt worked!

08:48.904 --> 08:53.784
Listen, the important thing to remember
is this won't hurt as much as you think.

08:53.867 --> 08:55.452
l'm ready.

09:14.304 --> 09:16.932
You know what, Mrs Tanner...

09:17.015 --> 09:20.018
Just until Samantha
blows out her candles.

09:20.102 --> 09:21.979
What are you gonna wish for?

09:22.062 --> 09:23.730
- A bike?
- Nope.

09:23.814 --> 09:25.232
- A doll house?
- Nope.

09:25.315 --> 09:28.694
How about the ability
to make quick decisions?

09:28.777 --> 09:30.863
- Nope.
- How about this?

09:36.118 --> 09:37.953
- A pony?
- No!

09:38.036 --> 09:41.748
Enough. l don't think
you realise how serious this is.

09:41.832 --> 09:44.501
We need
to be worried about your mother.

09:44.585 --> 09:47.796
Your grandmother, your...

09:47.880 --> 09:50.424
l'm sorry, we haven't met.
l'm Dr Dorian.

09:50.507 --> 09:53.218
- You're very cute.
- Thank you. Come on, let's go.

09:53.302 --> 09:56.180
- Candles are still lit.
- OK.

09:56.263 --> 09:58.098
Here we go. Blow!

10:00.684 --> 10:03.520
l increased the heparin
to 1 ,500 units per hour.

10:03.604 --> 10:05.272
Does that sound like enough?

10:05.355 --> 10:07.357
Should be.

10:07.441 --> 10:10.360
Speaking of heparin,
have you slept with Turk yet?

10:10.444 --> 10:12.779
- What?!
- l'm sorry.

10:12.863 --> 10:14.948
Too personal.

10:16.575 --> 10:19.661
l like to wait.
l like a guy to want it so bad

10:19.745 --> 10:22.247
he thinks he isn't gonna get it ever.

10:22.331 --> 10:24.958
When he's lost the will to live,
l jump him.

10:25.042 --> 10:28.545
- So how long does that take?
- A month, maybe two.

10:28.629 --> 10:29.963
What about you?

10:30.047 --> 10:32.716
l like to use sex as an ice-breaker.

10:32.799 --> 10:35.010
And how's that working out for you?

10:35.093 --> 10:39.723
l guess l don't have what you
would call high self-esteem.

10:41.975 --> 10:45.979
- Let me know when you find the hernia.
- You got it.

10:46.063 --> 10:48.190
- We're so lost.
- We are not lost.

10:48.273 --> 10:49.858
- Go left here.
- lt's right.

10:49.942 --> 10:52.361
You passed his Cooper's ligament.

10:52.444 --> 10:55.280
- Stop and ask for directions.
- You wanna drive?

10:55.364 --> 10:58.700
Cos l will pull over
and let you drive this thing.

10:58.784 --> 11:02.830
Wait a second.
Go back to where you just were.

11:07.751 --> 11:09.545
What is that?

11:10.879 --> 11:16.009
Her O-sat's in the 80s.
And take a look at her heart rate.

11:17.386 --> 11:18.929
Shoot!

11:19.012 --> 11:24.560
That's basically it. Your kidneys aren't
responding to medication any more.

11:24.643 --> 11:27.521
We're gonna
have to start you on dialysis.

11:27.604 --> 11:30.357
l'm not a big fan of dialysis.

11:30.440 --> 11:32.734
We don't really have a choice.

11:32.818 --> 11:35.571
Actually, l do have a choice.

11:35.654 --> 11:39.074
<i>Certain things you never expect
people to say.</i>

11:39.157 --> 11:41.285
l think l'm ready to die.

11:42.452 --> 11:44.997
l've got a ton of bricks for Dr Dorian.

11:55.924 --> 11:57.885
Can l get that pen back?

12:18.697 --> 12:22.409
You're gonna have to
shut your mouth at some point.

12:22.492 --> 12:26.747
Sweetie, l'm 7 4 years old.
l'm ready to go.

12:26.830 --> 12:30.167
With dialysis you could
live another 80 or 90 years.

12:30.250 --> 12:32.336
You're being a little irrational.

12:32.419 --> 12:35.005
- No, l'm not.
- Everybody dies some time.

12:35.088 --> 12:36.715
No, they don't.

12:36.798 --> 12:41.720
Sir, we're really lucky we found
the lymphoma when we did.

12:41.803 --> 12:45.849
Of course. l'll wait till you
get here before l tell David.

12:45.933 --> 12:47.559
See you soon.

12:47.643 --> 12:51.772
l hope you're not using that phone
to make a personal call.

12:51.855 --> 12:56.693
No, that was David Morrison's father.
He's a patient of mine. A good kid.

12:56.777 --> 13:00.030
He sounds terrific. You two
are becoming best pals, huh?

13:00.113 --> 13:03.659
What we should do is the three
of us play a game of stick ball.

13:03.742 --> 13:08.038
All we need is a stick, a ball
and a pocket full of dreams.

13:08.121 --> 13:11.291
Or we could take turns
bowling your patient

13:11.375 --> 13:13.460
down the hallways of my hospital.

13:13.544 --> 13:15.838
- l can explain.
- Spare me.

13:15.921 --> 13:20.634
Spare you. That's good, sir,
cos of the bowling thing.

13:20.717 --> 13:23.428
- You're not making a joke.
- Not at the moment.

13:23.512 --> 13:26.139
He's a good kid and he needed a friend.

13:26.223 --> 13:31.687
Your patients don't need friends,
they need a doctor.

13:31.770 --> 13:35.357
Her BP's dropping. Maybe
it's time to push thrombolytics.

13:35.440 --> 13:38.819
- What would you do?
- That's way out of my league.

13:38.902 --> 13:42.948
She seems to be decompensating
but thrombolytics scare me.

13:43.031 --> 13:45.367
A lot of times the patient bleeds out.

13:47.286 --> 13:50.164
She needs to know what's going on.

13:52.374 --> 13:54.835
l'll be right back.

13:55.794 --> 13:59.756
- She doesn't want dialysis?
- But what does that mean?

13:59.840 --> 14:03.093
lf she declines dialysis,
there is no ethical dilemma.

14:03.177 --> 14:06.013
But what about our duty
to do everything...

14:06.096 --> 14:09.474
''What about our duty...?''

14:09.558 --> 14:12.769
Look, this has nothing
to do with the patient.

14:12.853 --> 14:15.939
This is all about you.
You are afraid of death.

14:16.023 --> 14:18.692
And you can't be. You're in medicine.

14:18.775 --> 14:22.237
You gotta accept that everything
we do here, everything,

14:22.321 --> 14:24.114
is a stall.

14:24.198 --> 14:28.368
We're just trying to keep
the game going, that's it.

14:28.452 --> 14:31.914
But, ultimately,
it always ends up the same way.

14:35.292 --> 14:38.253
- l win.
- Where? l don't see.

14:38.337 --> 14:40.130
Here, diagonally.

14:40.214 --> 14:43.509
Pretty sneaky, Death.

14:46.136 --> 14:48.555
Hope l helped.

14:49.723 --> 14:52.684
Dr Kelso came down on you, huh?

14:52.768 --> 14:56.104
Yeah, but he's got a point.
This is a hospital.

14:56.188 --> 14:58.941
lt's not a playground.

14:59.024 --> 15:03.654
Well, if it isn't the medulla oblongata.
That's about 50 points there.

15:03.737 --> 15:07.533
l won. l'll just take
your fruit cup and be on my way.

15:07.616 --> 15:09.868
l talked to my dad today.

15:09.952 --> 15:11.578
- He's coming out.
- Cool.

15:11.662 --> 15:14.456
And that nurse came by
to shave me again.

15:14.540 --> 15:17.251
- l didn't tell her to do that.
- You didn't?

15:17.334 --> 15:19.586
No. l think she's got a crush on you.

15:21.421 --> 15:26.802
- Come on, dude, what's going on?
- OK, here's the deal.

15:36.854 --> 15:39.398
<i>She's telling her family.</i>

15:39.481 --> 15:43.694
<i>There's nothing that could
make me go in there right now.</i>

16:04.006 --> 16:07.801
- You didn't tell them, did you?
- lt didn't come up.

16:07.885 --> 16:10.637
Look, they don't need that burden.

16:10.721 --> 16:13.557
And they'd give me reasons
to change my mind.

16:13.640 --> 16:17.102
Speaking of which,
l took the liberty of jotting down

16:17.186 --> 16:21.523
a few things l think everybody should do
at least once in their life.

16:21.607 --> 16:26.278
OK, number one: eat a sausage
and pepper hoagie from Enrico's.

16:26.361 --> 16:28.405
l've done that.

16:28.488 --> 16:31.867
Number two: go to Asia.

16:36.455 --> 16:38.040
l'll take that as a yes.

16:38.123 --> 16:41.418
And l'll also check off
''learn a foreign language''.

16:48.967 --> 16:51.512
What happened to
''l'll be right back''?

16:51.595 --> 16:55.349
l can't believe l started to
think l'd been wrong about you.

16:55.432 --> 16:59.978
That woman needs her doctor to tell her
something, anything, and you run away?

17:00.062 --> 17:02.231
Are you even gonna look at me?

17:02.314 --> 17:04.691
l've been deciding what drink to get.

17:04.775 --> 17:09.655
Trying to choose between cherry soda
and ginger ale, and you know what?

17:09.738 --> 17:12.491
lt's a toss-up.
Either way l get a cold drink.

17:12.574 --> 17:16.744
lt would be impossible for me to
kill someone with this decision but...

17:16.829 --> 17:19.205
l still can't make it.

17:20.249 --> 17:22.459
l think l'm in trouble here.

17:23.377 --> 17:24.920
Look...

17:25.628 --> 17:29.675
These kinds of decisions
aren't easy for anyone.

17:29.758 --> 17:33.220
lf it's any consolation,
one of the reasons l never liked you

17:33.303 --> 17:37.474
is you're already better than most
of the doctors that come here.

17:37.558 --> 17:41.854
l kinda liked being the only smart,
strong chick in the joint.

17:41.937 --> 17:44.648
You sort of just complimented me.

17:44.731 --> 17:46.775
A little bit.

17:47.776 --> 17:50.153
OK, l'm gonna have a ginger ale.

17:50.237 --> 17:51.780
Good start.

17:53.156 --> 17:57.452
That clot isn't going anywhere on its
own, so let's push the thrombolytics.

17:57.536 --> 17:59.580
OK.

17:59.663 --> 18:01.748
Here we go.

18:02.416 --> 18:04.209
Go to the top of the Eiffel Tower.

18:04.293 --> 18:08.630
- Done.
- Go to the top of the Meiffel Tower.

18:08.714 --> 18:12.259
- Now you're making stuff up.
- No, l'm not. lt's right here.

18:12.342 --> 18:13.677
Listen, Dr Dorian,

18:13.760 --> 18:17.931
there is not one thing l regret
as l lay here right now.

18:18.015 --> 18:20.726
l'm ready. l really am.

18:21.518 --> 18:25.147
- You have had an amazing life.
- Good. Now we agree.

18:25.230 --> 18:28.150
Aren't there other patients
you need to be seeing?

18:28.233 --> 18:30.569
Me? No, l've been off for two hours.

18:30.652 --> 18:34.865
So with your precious free time,
you've been talking to an old lady.

18:34.948 --> 18:37.868
What about your list?
How many have you done?

18:37.951 --> 18:42.247
For that matter, how many times have you
sat on the grass and done nothing?

18:42.331 --> 18:45.501
You need to start
taking some time for yourself.

18:45.584 --> 18:48.045
Promise me you'll do that.

18:48.128 --> 18:50.172
- l will.
- Good.

18:50.255 --> 18:53.592
Now, get outta here. Go on.

18:53.675 --> 18:58.180
l just wanna check out
a few things before l get going.

19:04.770 --> 19:07.189
Are you OK?

19:07.272 --> 19:10.067
- l'm scared.
- Come here.

19:10.150 --> 19:11.193
Come here.

19:18.742 --> 19:23.330
You're OK.
You'll be just fine.

19:23.413 --> 19:25.541
Not to worry.

20:20.596 --> 20:24.224
l wanted you to know
she went very peacefully.

20:26.935 --> 20:29.980
l know you did everything
you could for my son.

20:30.063 --> 20:34.151
l can't tell you how glad l am
he had a friend here with him.

20:38.739 --> 20:42.242
Don't second-guess yourself.
You made the right call.

20:42.326 --> 20:44.411
You did.

20:44.995 --> 20:46.038
l know.

20:46.121 --> 20:48.207
Your mother's kidney...

20:48.290 --> 20:52.544
<i>They say one out of every three patients
admitted will die here.</i>

20:52.628 --> 20:56.215
<i>But some days,
the odds are worse than that.</i>

20:56.298 --> 20:58.425
l'm really sorry.

20:58.509 --> 21:01.929
<i>And on days like that,
the best you can hope for</i>

21:02.012 --> 21:05.098
<i>is that you took
something from it.</i>

21:08.060 --> 21:09.853
Hey, l'm Turk.

21:09.937 --> 21:11.063
<i>Anything.</i>

21:11.146 --> 21:14.149
BP's 1 20 over 80.
Let's keep it that way.

21:14.233 --> 21:16.318
<i>Anything at all.</i>

21:17.444 --> 21:20.239
<i>Even if it's just taking
the time to lie on the grass</i>

21:20.322 --> 21:23.951
<i>and think about all the things
you still have left to do.</i>
