00:37.413 --> 00:40.580
What a beautiful day,

00:41.213 --> 00:44.343
my little friend.

00:46.178 --> 00:48.411
Congratulations.

00:48.413 --> 00:52.280
Becoming my meal
is a great honor for you.

02:35.911 --> 02:38.876
Well, are you up
to your old tricks again?

02:38.878 --> 02:41.277
You just refuse to listen,
even though I warned you.

02:41.279 --> 02:43.176
Fine! Let's do it
the hard way, then.

02:43.178 --> 02:48.810
Take it easy, friend.
Let's talk like civilized animals.

02:48.812 --> 02:52.644
Give me those monkeys.
They're mine.

02:52.646 --> 02:54.910
Mm-mmm.
Not convinced.

02:58.046 --> 03:00.378
Just you wait, beefcake.

03:00.380 --> 03:03.677
My memory is longer
than my tail,

03:03.679 --> 03:06.780
and you will be sorry...

03:07.945 --> 03:10.213
very soon.

03:12.845 --> 03:15.944
- Hmm.
- What is going on?

03:15.946 --> 03:18.176
Come on. We've got
lots of work to do.

03:18.178 --> 03:21.646
Yes, dear. Right away, dear.
I'll be right there.

03:25.246 --> 03:27.877
We have a bit of fun
with the guys here.

03:27.879 --> 03:29.909
Just like old times.

03:33.711 --> 03:34.713
Huh?

03:55.711 --> 03:57.213
What?

03:57.911 --> 03:59.012
Huh?

04:02.878 --> 04:04.843
Ah. Phew!

04:04.845 --> 04:07.245
I'm glad it was just a dream.
Huh?

04:11.312 --> 04:14.709
"Today you will witness a rocket
being launched for the moon

04:14.711 --> 04:17.910
carrying this forest's first
space traveler, Oscar the hare."

04:17.911 --> 04:19.378
What? Oscar?

04:22.413 --> 04:25.613
I don't like you.
I don't like you.

04:41.679 --> 04:44.344
I'm so cool. I'm cool.

04:48.279 --> 04:50.277
Mr. Mic-Mic? Mr. Mic-Mic?

04:52.078 --> 04:55.277
Good morning. Are you coming
to see the rocket launch?

04:55.279 --> 04:58.744
Absolutely not,
and you should do the same.

04:58.746 --> 05:00.776
Ugh!
There's nothing to see there.

05:00.778 --> 05:02.777
All right. Suit yourself.

05:02.779 --> 05:04.410
Have a good day.

05:07.078 --> 05:08.179
Don't leave.

05:17.978 --> 05:23.144
Hey there, Mic-Mic.
Are you coming to watch the rocket launch?

05:23.146 --> 05:26.976
No, Houston!
We don't want a problem.

05:26.978 --> 05:31.080
But it's not nonsense.
Your friend Oscar's going to the moon.

05:31.846 --> 05:33.343
Oscar's not my friend, dude.

05:33.345 --> 05:36.579
Okay, I see.
No more questions.

05:39.212 --> 05:41.176
So you're not comin'?

05:43.711 --> 05:45.947
No!

05:47.213 --> 05:50.909
Why didn't you just say so?
What's up with all the yelling?

05:50.911 --> 05:54.046
Gosh. Sometimes you
just need to chill out.

06:11.678 --> 06:13.344
Oh, what the...

06:20.845 --> 06:22.080
Who's there?

06:25.645 --> 06:26.579
I'm there.

06:28.412 --> 06:30.411
And where is there?

06:30.413 --> 06:35.910
Well, I thought I was home,
where I had privacy.

06:35.912 --> 06:39.378
Ah! Mic-Mic, it's you, huh?

06:39.380 --> 06:44.310
I heard they're launching
a rocket to the moon.

06:44.312 --> 06:47.677
I can't see a thing,
but I had a brilliant idea.

06:47.679 --> 06:53.076
Why don't you come along and tell me
everything that's happening all around?

06:53.078 --> 06:56.843
Come on! Do you really believe
he's going on that flight?

06:56.845 --> 06:59.144
A kite?

06:59.146 --> 07:03.378
No, he's not using a kite.
He's using a rocket.

07:03.380 --> 07:05.746
I don't care
if he flies in his own pocket,

07:06.746 --> 07:10.344
'cause I'm... not... going.

07:10.346 --> 07:12.314
Why crowing?

07:13.178 --> 07:14.976
There's no crowing.

07:14.978 --> 07:18.712
I'm talking about your friend
Oscar who's going to the moon.

07:19.411 --> 07:22.311
Oscar's not my friend.

07:22.313 --> 07:26.712
He's not!

07:30.946 --> 07:34.976
I don't need friends.

07:34.978 --> 07:37.643
Got it, Stevie?

07:37.645 --> 07:41.143
I got it, I got it.
I'm glad you're coming.

07:41.145 --> 07:43.810
I'll be on my way.
You catch up.

07:43.812 --> 07:45.876
See you at the launchpad.

07:48.013 --> 07:50.246
<i>♪ On the road again... ♪</i> Aah!

07:51.379 --> 07:53.044
Huh? Uh...

07:54.912 --> 07:56.744
Huh?

08:19.846 --> 08:23.410
My friends,
today is definitely the day.

08:23.412 --> 08:25.012
The moon is within our reach.

08:26.045 --> 08:27.944
That's one small step for a...

08:27.946 --> 08:30.111
...a hare,

08:30.113 --> 08:33.376
yet one giant leap
for the whole animal kingdom.

08:33.378 --> 08:34.909
Hey, have you guys
seen Mic-Mic?

08:34.910 --> 08:36.311
Uh-uh.

08:36.313 --> 08:38.080
He said he's not coming.

08:39.078 --> 08:40.746
Yeah, not a chance.

08:45.179 --> 08:47.044
Well, haters gonna hate.

08:47.046 --> 08:49.077
I will not let them win.

08:49.079 --> 08:52.713
I will prove to him...
I mean them... I mean everyone!

09:05.711 --> 09:07.243
Huh.

09:07.245 --> 09:10.244
Oops. I forgot the fuel.

09:12.778 --> 09:14.343
It happens.

09:14.345 --> 09:16.846
Come on.

09:19.213 --> 09:21.212
We got a liftoff!

09:39.412 --> 09:41.909
Houston,
we have got a problem.

09:41.911 --> 09:44.877
Yeah, we most certainly do.

09:44.879 --> 09:47.844
Did you just say a serpent flew too?

09:47.846 --> 09:52.346
No, no, I'm sure Oscar's flying
that rocket all by himself.

09:57.946 --> 09:59.880
Goodbye, Oscar.

10:00.811 --> 10:02.712
Goodbye, friend.

10:03.379 --> 10:05.813
Have a safe journey.

10:23.145 --> 10:25.147
My busy bees.

10:26.112 --> 10:27.310
Hmm.

10:27.312 --> 10:29.912
Huh?

10:36.979 --> 10:38.210
Hey!

10:59.278 --> 11:00.813
Oops.

11:06.311 --> 11:08.210
Huh?

11:18.178 --> 11:19.712
Mm!

11:28.945 --> 11:30.946
Holy goats!

11:34.379 --> 11:36.776
Time to get out of here.

11:36.778 --> 11:38.310
Get out of here! Right now?

11:38.312 --> 11:40.076
Yes, right now.

11:40.078 --> 11:42.211
- Come on, boy. Come on, boy.
- Watch the ears! Watch the ears!

11:56.113 --> 11:57.046
Whoa.

12:08.278 --> 12:11.409
Wild Beak 2, do you copy?
How's the weather over Paris?

12:11.411 --> 12:13.776
It's okay. The sky is clear.

12:13.778 --> 12:16.744
But we expect a little rain today.
How about you?

12:16.746 --> 12:20.876
I'm flying to India. Hope to
avoid turbulence when I fly over Mumbai.

12:20.878 --> 12:22.709
Stop the chatter, boys.

12:22.711 --> 12:25.279
Keep this channel clear.
Good luck to everyone.

12:42.244 --> 12:44.046
Wow. Look, guys, it's Carl.

12:45.312 --> 12:48.876
I cannot believe
they've hired him back.

12:48.878 --> 12:51.709
I guess the management's
really desperate.

12:51.711 --> 12:53.876
He's on probation for now.

12:53.878 --> 12:56.844
What poor animal are you
delivering this time, Carl?

12:56.846 --> 12:59.342
He's got a baby panda.

12:59.344 --> 13:02.809
- Great.
- Don't mess it up, Carl.

13:02.811 --> 13:05.910
Like when you delivered
a baby zebra to a horse couple.

13:15.178 --> 13:17.112
Hmm?

13:23.646 --> 13:25.245
Mm-mm-mm!

13:41.078 --> 13:42.309
- It was fun.
- It was fun.

13:42.311 --> 13:45.376
Don't try to take that baby
to a bear, Carl.

13:45.378 --> 13:48.910
Don't you worry.

13:48.912 --> 13:51.279
It's okay, little baby.
Everything's under control.

14:21.344 --> 14:24.010
Wait. I'm totally confused.

14:24.012 --> 14:27.643
Who is this baby for,
pandas or bears?

14:27.645 --> 14:28.879
Huh?

14:29.911 --> 14:33.043
Right, I remember.
Of course it was bears.

14:33.045 --> 14:34.677
There's no doubt about it.

14:45.879 --> 14:49.242
Two words for you, Oscar:
long-eared rocketman.

14:49.244 --> 14:52.209
Listen. I understand
you're probably upset.

14:52.211 --> 14:54.176
Who's upset? I'm upset?

14:54.178 --> 14:56.979
- Yeah.
- No!

14:57.878 --> 15:04.612
I'm furious!

15:05.945 --> 15:07.910
I'm very sorry, Mic-Mic,

15:07.912 --> 15:09.877
but it's your own fault, you know.

15:09.879 --> 15:12.012
You set up those beehives
in the wrong order, and...

15:13.779 --> 15:15.109
That's why they fell down.

15:15.111 --> 15:17.143
All you had to do is set them up
the right way.

15:17.145 --> 15:20.310
Then even a dozen bunnies crashing
down from the skies couldn't break 'em.

15:20.312 --> 15:22.209
Are you insane, rocket-hare?

15:22.211 --> 15:25.109
Why on earth do you tell
everybody that we are friends?

15:25.111 --> 15:26.976
You are not friends
with me, Oscar.

15:26.978 --> 15:31.110
You're nothing but a pathetic loser
who's always getting us into trouble.

15:31.112 --> 15:34.075
Nothing good ever comes out of
your mischief, absolutely nothing.

15:34.077 --> 15:36.876
What are you talking about?

15:36.878 --> 15:39.377
You kept saying the rocket
would never fly, but it did.

15:39.379 --> 15:44.777
Your stupid rocket flew so well, it
turned my favorite boat into Swiss cheese.

15:44.779 --> 15:46.342
All my beehives are ruined.

15:46.344 --> 15:47.777
And you nearly killed me!

15:47.779 --> 15:49.844
But I didn't, right?

15:49.846 --> 15:51.809
Yeah.

15:51.811 --> 15:55.275
But remember how you decided to dam
the river and my house got flooded?

15:55.277 --> 15:58.243
I... I just wanted to make
a lake and raise trout.

15:58.245 --> 16:01.342
And then you decided to drill a
hole in my garden to pump oil.

16:01.344 --> 16:03.209
Remember that, fluff-head?

16:03.211 --> 16:06.309
And out came a fountain
of boiling hot water!

16:06.311 --> 16:09.976
And then a b-b-beautiful
coconut tree grew in its place.

16:09.978 --> 16:12.779
Except I don't
even like coconuts.

16:18.144 --> 16:21.376
I'm sorry, I really couldn't hear you.
Can you repeat what you just said?

16:21.378 --> 16:23.410
Yes, I said, "Get out."

16:26.112 --> 16:29.709
Okay, you're absolutely right, but I
swear, things will be different now.

16:29.711 --> 16:32.042
I thought it all through.
Do you believe me?

16:32.044 --> 16:33.843
I can help if you want.

16:33.845 --> 16:36.310
Collect the harvest,
bring the bees back...

16:36.312 --> 16:38.909
Forget the bees.
I'll make the honey myself.

16:38.911 --> 16:39.845
Who needs bees?

16:40.746 --> 16:42.012
No way. Go home.

16:44.411 --> 16:46.876
Thing is, my house
is kinda blown to pieces,

16:46.878 --> 16:48.743
or "turned to dust," I'd say.

16:48.745 --> 16:51.310
Can I stay at your place
for a while? Huh?

16:53.012 --> 16:56.276
So this is why you're
calling yourself my friend.

16:56.278 --> 16:58.876
No, I didn't mean it like that.

16:58.878 --> 17:01.975
Look, we make perfect
partners, you and I.

17:01.977 --> 17:05.710
A "superhare" like me always
needs a "superbear" like you.

17:05.712 --> 17:08.709
Together, we'll be
like Batman and Robin.

17:08.711 --> 17:10.876
- Like D'Artagnan and the Three Musketeers.
- Yeah? Yeah, yeah?

17:10.877 --> 17:12.675
Like Bonnie and Clyde.
Like, like...

17:12.678 --> 17:14.912
Dolce and Gabbana.

17:16.112 --> 17:18.776
Huh? No way.

17:18.778 --> 17:21.041
I don't wanna be like
Dolce and Gabbana with you.

17:21.044 --> 17:23.875
Yeah, well, what about
the Three Musketeers?

17:23.877 --> 17:25.912
Forget about it!

17:32.845 --> 17:34.376
We'll be famous in no time.

17:34.378 --> 17:36.876
Oh, the places we'll go.
We'll be on our way up.

17:36.878 --> 17:39.275
We'll be seeing great sights.
We'll rock the world.

17:39.277 --> 17:40.245
No!

17:42.145 --> 17:45.110
Oh, come on.
You know you want to.

17:45.112 --> 17:47.079
Hmm?

17:55.045 --> 17:56.342
- Hmm?
- Huh?

18:04.045 --> 18:07.779
"Baby panda." Mic-Mic,
why did you order this?

18:10.145 --> 18:11.112
I didn't.

18:37.344 --> 18:40.009
Oscar, do something.
I'm begging you.

18:40.011 --> 18:42.313
I cannot stand when babies cry.
It drives me nuts.

18:46.811 --> 18:50.175
He's just hungry. I heard babies
cry when they want something to eat.

18:50.177 --> 18:51.279
Really?

18:52.378 --> 18:53.909
So, what do they eat?

18:53.911 --> 18:55.644
All babies drink milk.

18:55.646 --> 18:56.943
Are you sure?

18:56.945 --> 18:58.143
I think so.

18:58.145 --> 18:59.779
Where do we get milk?

19:00.278 --> 19:01.909
Uh...

19:01.911 --> 19:03.978
Uh... I got it.

19:10.045 --> 19:12.775
Hey, Mic-Mic.
How about we keep this baby, huh?

19:12.777 --> 19:14.345
Oh, he's so cute!

19:16.044 --> 19:18.242
You can be his daddy,
and I can be...

19:18.244 --> 19:20.075
Stop it right there, okay?

19:20.077 --> 19:24.145
I want my regular life back 'cause
this is absolutely "unregular."

19:25.678 --> 19:27.776
A baby panda in my house?

19:27.778 --> 19:29.942
He has to go back
to his parents immediately.

19:29.944 --> 19:32.275
They're probably
worried sick by now.

19:32.277 --> 19:35.010
Really?
What should we do?

19:35.012 --> 19:38.875
We? Who said anything
about "we"?

19:38.877 --> 19:40.775
Forget about it.

19:46.677 --> 19:48.178
Huh?

19:52.245 --> 19:55.042
Well, it really is
a baby panda.

19:55.044 --> 19:58.909
Pandas live in bamboo forests
far off in the south.

19:58.911 --> 20:01.943
Huh. Sounds like a big trip.

20:01.945 --> 20:07.675
Well, if we sail down the river,
it just might be doable.

20:07.677 --> 20:09.111
The river.

20:31.342 --> 20:32.842
You've got to find a way
to go with them, Oscar.

20:32.844 --> 20:35.612
Come on, think. Think.
There's got to be a way.

20:37.112 --> 20:39.775
Mic-Mic, are you sure
you don't need any help?

20:39.777 --> 20:41.109
Not from you.

20:41.111 --> 20:42.908
I could be your first mate.

20:42.910 --> 20:46.076
Get lost.

20:46.078 --> 20:47.843
Wait! I could help
with the supplies.

20:49.277 --> 20:52.146
Why is it so heavy?

20:57.178 --> 20:58.313
Get out of here.

21:02.277 --> 21:04.909
Don't give up, Oscar.
There's got to be a way.

21:04.911 --> 21:07.612
You've just got to think hard.
Come on, come on.

21:12.311 --> 21:16.209
Oh! Mic-Mic, please,
you've gotta take me with you.

21:16.211 --> 21:19.075
For the sake of our friendship.
Please, you've got to.

21:19.077 --> 21:21.776
I already told you
I'm not taking you.

21:21.778 --> 21:23.909
We won't last a mile
with you on board.

21:23.911 --> 21:27.176
And we're not friends, all right, Oscar?
Goodbye and good luck.

21:27.178 --> 21:32.645
Okay, okay. If that's the way
you want it, I'll just...

21:39.111 --> 21:41.975
- Oh, and you know what, Oscar?
- Yes?

21:41.977 --> 21:45.043
Rebuild my beehives
before I come back.

21:45.045 --> 21:46.876
Oh!

21:46.878 --> 21:48.812
Gosh, what a clown!

21:55.011 --> 21:57.142
Huh?

21:57.144 --> 22:01.844
Mic-Mic? You really want
to leave me here all by myself?

22:32.345 --> 22:36.176
Now, that's paradise.
It's a good thing that Oscar's not around.

22:38.411 --> 22:39.345

23:31.412 --> 23:33.010
What?

23:33.012 --> 23:35.346
Hey! What's that?

23:36.845 --> 23:38.912
Huh?

23:41.777 --> 23:43.211
Now, that's interesting.

24:00.278 --> 24:03.377
I can fly! Whoo-hoo!

24:03.379 --> 24:05.645
Huh?

24:06.378 --> 24:08.145
Whoa!

24:15.810 --> 24:17.642
Holy guacamole!

24:25.810 --> 24:29.043
All right, Oscar.

24:31.144 --> 24:32.876
Uh, hiya, Mic-Mic.

24:32.878 --> 24:34.843
I was just, you know,
passing by,

24:34.845 --> 24:36.808
and I thought I'd drop in
for a cup of tea.

24:36.810 --> 24:39.343
Well, hello. And goodbye!

24:39.345 --> 24:42.345
Or maybe I could stay
for a bit?

24:43.212 --> 24:45.346
No and never.
Get out now, boy.

25:19.077 --> 25:21.210
Make yourself useful, boy.

25:21.212 --> 25:24.309
I promise.
You will not regret it. I...

25:24.311 --> 25:28.075
You, zip it! Understood?

25:28.077 --> 25:30.742
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

25:30.744 --> 25:33.309
And you too.

25:36.844 --> 25:39.879
Ugh. That song is so stupid!
Duh!

25:43.344 --> 25:46.009
I remember it
as if it were yesterday.

25:46.011 --> 25:49.243
I was crossing Africa
with a flock of ducks.

25:49.245 --> 25:54.843
So we were by Mount Kilimanjaro,
when suddenly eagles attacked us.

25:54.845 --> 25:56.708
Oh, <i>mon Dieu,</i>
what a fight it was!

25:56.710 --> 25:59.309
Let me tell you,
I fought like a wild beast.

25:59.311 --> 26:02.375
And I won. Thanks to me,
everyone was safe and sound.

26:02.377 --> 26:05.375
And the queen of ducks
gave me her heart.

26:07.945 --> 26:10.242
Why are you laughing?
I'm telling you the truth!

26:12.177 --> 26:14.976
Tell me, doc,
aren't you tired of your lies?

26:14.978 --> 26:17.376
No one around here
believes you anymore.

26:17.378 --> 26:19.809
Do you guys know
why he has such a huge beak?

26:19.811 --> 26:21.643
- Mm-mmm, Mm-mmm.
- Uh-uh, uh-uh.

26:21.645 --> 26:24.246
Because he needs enough room
to hold his blabbering tongue.

26:27.044 --> 26:31.808
Hmm. Well, do you guys know
why he has such a tiny head?

26:31.810 --> 26:35.009
Because it perfectly fits
his teeny-tiny brain.

26:37.245 --> 26:38.975
Wait, what?

26:38.977 --> 26:42.175
Does that mean my brain
is teeny-tiny too?

26:42.177 --> 26:43.611
Or mine?

26:44.745 --> 26:46.274
Um...

26:46.276 --> 26:49.308
At least we're smart enough
to know when we're not welcome.

26:49.310 --> 26:52.375
Oh, I will leave,
but it's your loss.

26:52.377 --> 26:56.809
You will never get to know
the true power of imagination.

26:56.811 --> 26:58.742
I'm off to tell
the whole world

26:58.744 --> 27:00.875
about my adventures.

27:00.877 --> 27:03.842
Goodbye and good riddance,
you over-feathered decoy.

27:03.844 --> 27:06.975
Duke, don't take it
too close to heart.

27:06.977 --> 27:11.375
They didn't even understand who they
had the pleasure of speaking to.

27:11.377 --> 27:15.643
Their whole reason of existence
is to become a Peking duck.

27:15.645 --> 27:17.979
Oh!

27:21.778 --> 27:25.179
Oh, would you look at that!
What do we have here?

27:29.377 --> 27:34.274
Ladies and gentlemen, please make sure
your seat belts are securely fastened

27:34.276 --> 27:36.709
and your seats are
in the upright position.

27:36.711 --> 27:38.308
We're beginning to descend.

27:45.145 --> 27:48.241
Okay, Oscar,
the wheel is all yours.

27:48.243 --> 27:51.009
And I'm gonna have
a nice nap.

27:51.011 --> 27:54.242
You stay the course and make
sure the baby doesn't cry.

27:54.244 --> 27:55.878
Got it?

27:56.310 --> 27:58.143
Aye, aye, Captain.

27:58.145 --> 27:59.743
Clown.

28:03.710 --> 28:06.344
- -It's an inside
joke, you know? Heh.

28:08.810 --> 28:10.578
Huh?

28:17.845 --> 28:20.208
<i>Bonjour,</i> my friends.

28:20.210 --> 28:23.743
<i>Mon chéri,</i>
let me tell you a story.

28:23.745 --> 28:27.241
Once, I took part in a sailing
race in the Strait of Gibraltar.

28:27.243 --> 28:29.942
I'm sorry,
a sailing race where?

28:29.944 --> 28:33.775
What? You set sail without
any theoretical knowledge?

28:33.777 --> 28:37.709
The Strait of Gibraltar
is the strait between...

28:37.711 --> 28:39.909
Who are you, exactly? Huh?

28:39.911 --> 28:43.876
Let me introduce myself.
I am Duke the Pelican,

28:43.878 --> 28:47.875
a traveler, a humanist
and also a philanthropist.

28:47.877 --> 28:50.376
Goodbye, tomato-face.
Good riddance.

28:50.378 --> 28:53.109
Fly safe. Bon voyage.

28:53.111 --> 28:56.742
But I was hoping for a cup of
tea with a splash of milk, maybe.

28:56.744 --> 28:59.175
In return, I would love
to tell you about...

28:59.177 --> 29:02.042
You were hoping, huh?
We don't serve tea on Fridays.

29:02.044 --> 29:04.375
Is it Friday already?

29:04.377 --> 29:07.109
Let me tell you a story.

29:07.111 --> 29:12.309
When I served at the great sultan's
harem, every Friday we used to...

29:12.311 --> 29:13.975
Get off my raft.

29:18.378 --> 29:20.075
Oscar!

29:20.077 --> 29:21.011
Just a sec.

29:27.911 --> 29:30.775
<i>♪ La cucaracha, la cucaracha ♪</i>

29:30.777 --> 29:32.375
<i>♪ La, la, la, la, la, la, la ♪</i>

29:32.377 --> 29:34.342
Let me tell you a story.

29:34.344 --> 29:37.842
Once upon a time, when I babysat
the future queen of England...

29:37.844 --> 29:40.408
Now, when was this?
If I remember correctly...

29:40.410 --> 29:44.075
Right! George V was king back
then, and you know what?

29:50.878 --> 29:52.909
- Huh?
- Huh?

29:52.911 --> 29:54.375
Huh?

29:54.377 --> 29:58.309
But I guess you're not
interested in all that, are you?

29:58.311 --> 30:03.142
No, tomato-face.
Tell us all about it. Come on.

30:03.144 --> 30:05.612
I'll be thrilled to listen
to all your stories.

30:06.343 --> 30:07.579
Oh, really?

30:08.844 --> 30:11.241
Let me tell you another story.

30:11.243 --> 30:16.976
Once, I was at the reception of
Pharaoh Two-tongue-come-on XV...

30:16.978 --> 30:20.843
I don't know why they called him that.
I'm pretty sure he had just one tongue.

30:23.011 --> 30:26.242
By the way,
where are we going?

30:26.244 --> 30:28.876
We're taking this baby
panda back to his parents.

30:28.878 --> 30:32.843
Oh, a noble mission?
I am so honored!

30:32.845 --> 30:37.309
Okay, Oscar, turn to shore.
It's time to roast this goose.

30:37.311 --> 30:39.376
But you can't roast me. I'm no goose.

30:39.378 --> 30:41.345
Too bad. I be hungry.

31:04.811 --> 31:06.676
Hmm?

31:08.810 --> 31:12.342
Well,
look at you, all seized up again.

31:12.344 --> 31:14.642
Who's there?

31:14.644 --> 31:16.341
Good question.

31:16.343 --> 31:18.308
Who do you think?

31:18.310 --> 31:21.975
Well, uh, I don't know.

31:21.977 --> 31:27.009
Come on, think really hard.

31:27.011 --> 31:30.241
You <i>do</i> know.

31:30.243 --> 31:33.141
- Because I am you.
- What?

31:35.276 --> 31:37.209
No, I'm me.

31:37.211 --> 31:42.708
That's right, but...
I am the best part of you.

31:42.710 --> 31:44.141
The best?

31:44.143 --> 31:47.375
Yes. I am your fear.

31:50.845 --> 31:52.942
I came here to tell you that...

31:52.944 --> 31:55.311
I'm proud of you.

31:57.144 --> 32:01.141
You are so scared
of everything around you

32:01.143 --> 32:04.643
that the fear
literally paralyzes you.

32:04.645 --> 32:06.808
But... But I don't want
to be scared.

32:06.810 --> 32:08.843
Oh, but you should.

32:08.845 --> 32:12.309
This forest right here
is the worst place to be.

32:12.311 --> 32:16.209
It is full of spine-chilling
horrors and hidden dangers.

32:16.211 --> 32:18.075
Hear this rustling?

32:20.943 --> 32:22.974
Or that squeaking?

32:22.976 --> 32:26.174
Wild animals everywhere.

32:32.378 --> 32:34.974
Paralyzed by fear,
just like I said.

32:34.976 --> 32:37.342
But I'm so tired
of being afraid.

32:37.344 --> 32:39.175
I'm shunned by my own pack.

32:39.177 --> 32:40.809
That's a good thing.

32:40.811 --> 32:42.408
They're not worthy of you.

32:42.410 --> 32:46.209
They are fools pretending
that they have courage.

32:46.211 --> 32:51.044
They're unhappy because being brave
is the most tiring thing in the world.

32:52.944 --> 32:57.042
No! You don't exist.
You're a figment of my imagination.

32:57.044 --> 32:59.074
You're just a hallucination.

32:59.076 --> 33:01.676
A hallucination?

33:01.678 --> 33:03.309
You can touch me if you want.

33:03.311 --> 33:05.874
No. I-I'm scared of you.

33:05.876 --> 33:08.941
That's right.
You should be.

33:08.943 --> 33:11.974
Good boy.

33:11.976 --> 33:14.908
Go away. Get out of my head.

33:14.910 --> 33:20.676
Leave me alone.
Get out, get out, get out!

33:20.678 --> 33:24.275
Trust me, boy.
You can't get rid of me that easily.

33:25.876 --> 33:30.044
No, you're stuck with me
forever and ever.

33:39.410 --> 33:42.145
Oscar, leave me alone.

33:43.744 --> 33:48.578
And then they asked me,
"Would you care for a fish?" And I said...

33:50.210 --> 33:52.275
"I don't eat fish."

33:52.277 --> 33:53.712
Everyone's asleep.

34:04.076 --> 34:05.744
Huh?

34:42.311 --> 34:43.643
Mic-Mic?

34:43.645 --> 34:45.940
What is it now?

34:45.943 --> 34:50.143
I never told this to anybody,
but my real parents were bears.

34:52.409 --> 34:56.208
My dad went missing
out at sea years ago.

34:56.210 --> 34:58.977
And my mom went looking for him.
Never came back.

34:59.909 --> 35:01.075
Really?

35:01.077 --> 35:04.045
I was brought up
by a family of hares.

35:05.076 --> 35:06.810
Son, is that you?

35:08.276 --> 35:09.244
Papa?

35:10.644 --> 35:12.042
My son!

35:12.044 --> 35:13.278
Papa!

35:15.311 --> 35:16.910
My son.

35:18.411 --> 35:19.712
Papa.

35:37.243 --> 35:40.275
And you're not mad that I turned
your favorite boat into Swiss cheese?

35:40.277 --> 35:43.308
No, of course not.
This is the boat.

35:43.310 --> 35:45.342
Even though we're sinking now
because of me?

35:45.344 --> 35:48.775
Who cares?
You're my son.

35:48.777 --> 35:50.341
What? Huh?

35:50.343 --> 35:52.974
We're sinking! We're sinking!
Help! We're sinking!

35:55.378 --> 35:57.044
Yeah, we're sinking!

36:03.310 --> 36:05.743
Huh? Huh? Wha?

36:06.644 --> 36:08.807
What's wrong? Mic-Mic?

36:08.809 --> 36:11.908
Ugh. Nothing's wrong.

36:11.910 --> 36:15.144
I just had the most awful dream.

36:16.011 --> 36:17.874
Something scary?

36:17.876 --> 36:20.209
You're not gonna believe this.

36:20.211 --> 36:22.878
I dreamt that you, Oscar...

36:23.910 --> 36:25.311
were my son!

36:28.044 --> 36:28.978
Me too.

36:41.310 --> 36:43.241
Whoa!

36:43.243 --> 36:45.710
Can you imagine?
That'd be a nightmare.

36:48.111 --> 36:52.241
Yeah, of course. A terrible dream.
Not a cool dream at all.

36:52.243 --> 36:55.044
Okay, Duke, it's your turn
to keep watch.

37:08.011 --> 37:08.945
Well...

37:10.644 --> 37:12.409
I guess I'll turn in too.

37:12.411 --> 37:15.142
Tomato-face,
please watch the baby.

37:15.144 --> 37:17.642
If he cries, tell him one
of your endless stories.

37:17.644 --> 37:19.941
Oh!

37:19.943 --> 37:23.841
I'll tell him about the time
when Leonardo da Vinci asked me

37:23.843 --> 37:26.010
to pose
for Mona Lisa's portrait.

37:29.077 --> 37:30.807
But then he changed his mind,

37:30.809 --> 37:33.677
and he replaced my splendid beak
with his neighbor's ugly face.

37:35.243 --> 37:38.108
For all I care, you can tell him

37:38.110 --> 37:41.774
you went to the ball with
Cinderella along with Snow White.

37:41.776 --> 37:43.210
Just remember your job...

37:47.244 --> 37:48.711
is to keep him quiet.

37:51.777 --> 37:53.408
Leave me alone.

37:53.410 --> 37:56.309
Get out of my head.

37:56.311 --> 38:00.145
You don't exist. You're not real.
Get... Get... Get out of my head!

38:02.343 --> 38:07.908
You're not real.
You're not real.

38:07.910 --> 38:09.008
Get away! Get away!

38:20.777 --> 38:22.775
And who are you, huh?

38:22.777 --> 38:26.009
Me? I'm Janus.

38:26.011 --> 38:29.175
And why did you freeze, Janus?

38:29.177 --> 38:34.075
I-I... I always freeze like this
when I'm afraid.

38:34.077 --> 38:35.774
Well, what are you afraid of?

38:35.776 --> 38:37.208
Everything.

38:37.210 --> 38:39.009
And everyone.

38:39.011 --> 38:43.045
- Ugh!
- Oh! Even us?

38:44.076 --> 38:46.141
You too. Especially you.

38:46.143 --> 38:48.041
Really? Even me?

38:48.043 --> 38:49.408
Yes, even you.

38:49.410 --> 38:50.741
A little bit.

38:58.844 --> 39:00.312

39:01.244 --> 39:03.041

39:15.644 --> 39:17.774
Let me tell you a story.

39:17.776 --> 39:21.875
Once upon a time,
we were camping by the Limpopo River,

39:21.877 --> 39:25.041
and a pack of hungry wolves
attacked us.

39:25.043 --> 39:28.342
Oh, <i>mon Dieu.</i>
You can't imagine the howling.

39:28.344 --> 39:30.177
Oh, the howling!

39:35.310 --> 39:37.244
Ugh!

39:44.977 --> 39:48.111
All right, time to leave.
Janus, you're coming with us.

39:49.111 --> 39:50.877
Uh, m-me?

39:52.710 --> 39:55.841
Yes, you. What?
You're too scared?

39:55.843 --> 39:59.177
I'm very scared,
but staying here...

40:00.777 --> 40:03.008
is even scarier.

40:03.010 --> 40:07.075
Well, it's decided then.
Come on. All aboard.

40:28.010 --> 40:31.342
My dear friends,
let me tell you another story.

40:31.344 --> 40:35.208
This is a good one.
We were right around these parts,

40:35.210 --> 40:37.175
me and my good friend, Tiger...

40:37.177 --> 40:40.341
Everyone knows
there's no tigers around here.

40:40.343 --> 40:42.675
Do you know what a blabbermouth
you are, tomato-face?

40:42.677 --> 40:44.874
Me? Blabbermouth?

40:44.876 --> 40:46.741
Mm-hmm.

40:46.743 --> 40:49.742
I swear.

40:49.744 --> 40:52.245
There <i>are</i> tigers here.

41:09.644 --> 41:12.842
Hello, little bee.
Would you like to be my friend?

41:12.844 --> 41:15.145
I'm terribly lonely.
I have no one to talk to.

41:17.210 --> 41:21.142
We can talk about weather
or sports, if you like.

41:21.144 --> 41:24.844
Or maybe even... Oh, I've got an idea.
We could write a poem together.

41:26.910 --> 41:31.675
"The bee or not the bee,
that is the question.

41:31.677 --> 41:36.075
Whether I stay and drink the
water from a puddle or rush ahead.

41:36.077 --> 41:37.808
Whoever knows?

41:37.810 --> 41:39.407
Who can tell me?

41:39.409 --> 41:45.211
Was I born to bravely win them
over as a courageous superhero?"

41:54.077 --> 41:56.109
Is something wrong with me?

41:56.111 --> 41:59.274
Why doesn't anyone
want to talk to me? Hmm?

41:59.276 --> 42:01.274
Everybody has friends
but me.

42:05.809 --> 42:07.841
I have another story to tell.

42:07.843 --> 42:10.708
One day, I was sailing
down the Zambezi River

42:10.710 --> 42:13.074
and suddenly ended up
in a very thick fog.

42:13.076 --> 42:16.109
Hold on, tomato-face.

42:16.111 --> 42:18.807
What's this noise?
I thought I heard something.

42:18.809 --> 42:20.941
Noise? Wasn't me.

42:20.943 --> 42:22.210
Oh, look!

42:34.409 --> 42:39.042
Remind me, tomato-face,
what you were saying about the fog?

42:39.044 --> 42:43.742
Uh... oh, yeah. That's right.
We were out in the fog...

42:43.744 --> 42:45.644
There. Watch out!

42:58.410 --> 42:59.711
<i>Mon Dieu!</i>

43:07.943 --> 43:10.273
Yo, grab the baby and fly away.

43:10.275 --> 43:12.944
Aye, aye, Captain.
Taking off now.

43:14.309 --> 43:15.674
What about you?

43:15.676 --> 43:18.807
Don't worry about us.
We're doomed.

43:18.809 --> 43:20.877
Yes, we are doomed.

43:24.077 --> 43:27.074
Maybe not.
I see a shore ahead.

43:27.076 --> 43:28.810
You can try to pull in there.

43:33.177 --> 43:35.277
- Oscar!
- Why always me?

43:36.910 --> 43:39.075
Steer the raft to that shore,
and I'll be rowing.

43:43.809 --> 43:45.011
Oscar!

44:02.310 --> 44:05.011
We can't sail any further.
Too many rocks.

44:08.010 --> 44:10.842
I knew I shouldn't
have taken you on board.

44:10.844 --> 44:14.908
You're always trouble.
A hare on board is always bad luck.

44:14.910 --> 44:17.974
What? You think I'm bad luck?
You were the one steering the raft.

44:17.976 --> 44:20.008
Oh, so this is my fault now?

44:20.010 --> 44:22.310
- It's not mine.
- And you all agree?

44:27.810 --> 44:30.374
Well, we...

44:30.376 --> 44:34.941
All right. Super-duper.
Well, I don't need you anymore.

44:34.943 --> 44:36.808
You guys can go home now.

44:36.810 --> 44:39.807
Hope you won't get lost on your
way, because I won't be there

44:39.809 --> 44:41.643
to be blamed for it.

44:47.176 --> 44:49.210
Oscar, dance now!

44:50.011 --> 44:51.241
Uh-uh!

44:51.243 --> 44:54.209
- All right. Tomato-face?
- Mm-mmm!

44:54.977 --> 44:56.978
Janus!

44:58.709 --> 45:01.010
Well, fine.
I'll handle it myself.

Okay.

45:23.743 --> 45:26.344
So I decided
to visit a friend...

45:27.709 --> 45:30.042
who also happens to be a bee,

45:30.044 --> 45:32.674
but then a badger showed up
and he said,

45:32.676 --> 45:37.307
"Your bee friend is not even a bee.
She's actually a wasp."

45:37.309 --> 45:39.011
What do you think of that?

45:58.077 --> 46:00.177
Hello, my dear friends.

46:03.910 --> 46:06.941
Who are you, an oversized bee?
Then buzz out of here.

46:06.943 --> 46:12.041
"I dreamed I was sailing away.
I even found a perfect way.

46:12.043 --> 46:16.041
But where am I headed?
Out there, under a dark sky.

46:16.043 --> 46:19.642
No one is waiting for me.
I can hear a baby cry.

46:19.644 --> 46:20.675
Maybe it's crying...

46:22.309 --> 46:23.577
...for me."

46:24.976 --> 46:27.208
So do you have a name,
Shakespeare?

46:27.210 --> 46:30.107
Uh, William...
Uh, I mean Amur.

46:30.109 --> 46:32.975
Well, Amur, <i>bonjour.</i>

46:32.977 --> 46:36.241
I'm on a quest to find this baby's parents.
Want to tag along?

46:36.243 --> 46:40.008
Of course. Looks like
I finally found a friend.

46:40.010 --> 46:41.941
Not again!
What have I ever done to you?

46:41.943 --> 46:44.675
You saved me from myself.

46:44.677 --> 46:48.711
All right, Lord Byron, that's enough.

48:57.644 --> 48:59.708

48:59.710 --> 49:02.974
I was elder statesman to the

55:52.809 --> 55:54.941
How could you forget?

55:54.943 --> 55:56.740
Uh... Uh...

55:56.742 --> 56:00.976
Daddy. Daddy.

56:01.809 --> 56:04.041
- Huh?
- Daddy.

56:04.043 --> 56:06.244
- No!
- Daddy.

56:11.143 --> 56:13.008
Daddy.

56:13.010 --> 56:14.311
Daddy.

56:15.376 --> 56:19.308
- Daddy. Daddy. Daddy.
- Phew.

56:19.310 --> 56:21.673
It's that nightmare again
that we both share.

56:21.675 --> 56:23.774
- Daddy.
- Huh?

56:23.776 --> 56:24.910
Daddy.

56:25.642 --> 56:27.308
Oscar!

56:29.175 --> 56:32.009
Oscar! Where's the baby?

56:32.843 --> 56:33.843
Huh?

56:36.210 --> 56:38.110
I'll be right back.

56:39.009 --> 56:40.208
Baby!

56:42.242 --> 56:43.276
Baby!

56:45.409 --> 56:46.809
Where are you?

56:49.709 --> 56:51.777
Baby!

56:53.976 --> 56:56.240
Baby.

56:56.242 --> 56:59.040
You should've went missing,
not the baby.

56:59.042 --> 57:02.706
You were supposed to be watching him!

57:02.708 --> 57:06.706
It's... It's all the elephants' fault.
If it weren't for them, I...

57:06.708 --> 57:08.974
The elephants? Huh?

57:08.976 --> 57:11.840
- Duke!
- Mic-Mic, it's your fault.

57:11.842 --> 57:15.341
You should have known Oscar
cannot be trusted with a baby.

57:15.343 --> 57:18.008
My fault?
And where have you been?

57:18.010 --> 57:20.840
Instead of watching Oscar,
who should have been watching the baby,

57:20.842 --> 57:22.374
you slept like a little piggy.

57:22.376 --> 57:24.907
And you know who else sleeps
like a little piggy?

57:24.909 --> 57:27.906
Lazy Thanksgiving turkeys.

57:27.908 --> 57:29.940
Excuse me?

57:29.942 --> 57:31.842
You're calling me a turkey?

57:33.643 --> 57:36.674
Well, now I'm mad.

57:36.676 --> 57:38.273
Now I'm really mad.

57:38.275 --> 57:40.307
The last time I was this mad,
I...

57:40.309 --> 57:42.873
Well, I...

57:42.875 --> 57:46.040
I can't remember one story.
That's how mad I am.

57:46.042 --> 57:50.673
Please don't fight, my friends.
How is this going to help the baby panda?

57:50.675 --> 57:54.273
Well, look who's purring here...
our little poet!

57:54.275 --> 57:55.609
Hmm?

57:56.175 --> 57:59.007
Hmm! Hmm!

57:59.009 --> 58:01.776
I've had it with all of you.
That's it. I'm leaving!

58:02.643 --> 58:03.643
Talk to the paw.

58:05.242 --> 58:07.406
Who does he think he is?

58:07.408 --> 58:09.243
He's leaving?
Well, I'm leaving too.

58:10.975 --> 58:13.176
Guys, you don't have
to be like that.

58:16.776 --> 58:20.806
Too bad. You were such a
good audience for my stories.

58:20.808 --> 58:22.010
Sometimes.

58:24.243 --> 58:27.173
Uh, so what shall we do now?

58:27.175 --> 58:31.008
I guess I'll be heading home.
What about you?

58:31.010 --> 58:35.742
M-Me? Uh, I'll just sit here,
scared to death.

58:59.243 --> 59:01.339
That's it!
I'm tired of being scared.

59:01.341 --> 59:03.277
I can't take it anymore.
All right...

59:16.743 --> 59:20.777
Let's see. Who would leave such a
long and wide track... like that?

59:21.242 --> 59:23.339
A crocodile?

59:23.341 --> 59:25.840
A crocodile!

59:25.842 --> 59:28.141
No. There would be footprints.

59:28.143 --> 59:31.140
Now, who else could it be?
Maybe a snake?

59:31.142 --> 59:34.706
That would have
to be a large snake.

59:34.708 --> 59:37.640
A very large snake.

59:40.809 --> 59:43.641
This time,
it's legitimately scary.

59:43.643 --> 59:45.406
You're absolutely right.

59:45.408 --> 59:46.842
It's horrifying.

59:48.408 --> 59:51.374
Anyone would be scared
to death.

59:51.376 --> 59:54.973
I mean, just think about it.
What could leave a trace like this?

59:54.975 --> 59:59.741
Well, probably something that can
swallow you in the blink of an eye.

59:59.743 --> 01:00:01.877
But I have to try
and save the baby.

01:00:02.775 --> 01:00:04.241
- Do you?
- Mm-hmm.

01:00:04.243 --> 01:00:06.609
Ha! Why on earth
would you do that?

01:00:07.742 --> 01:00:10.373
Let the others
do the dirty work.

01:00:10.375 --> 01:00:14.140
By the way, where did
your so-called friends go?

01:00:14.142 --> 01:00:15.807
There's nobody here?

01:00:22.176 --> 01:00:25.641
Well, that turned out great.

01:00:25.643 --> 01:00:28.141
So much for reuniting a family.
Ha-ha!

01:00:28.143 --> 01:00:31.240
So much for saving the day.
Yeah, my life story.

01:00:31.242 --> 01:00:34.073
"I try my best,
and you know the rest."

01:00:34.075 --> 01:00:37.108
Wait!

01:00:37.110 --> 01:00:41.008
What's wrong with me? There's still hope.
I have to go back.

01:00:41.010 --> 01:00:45.276
Yes! I will find baby panda.
I will get him back to his family.

01:00:49.109 --> 01:00:52.674
Why is it always my fault?
Go on, blame Oscar for everything.

01:00:52.676 --> 01:00:54.907
If something's wrong,
it's always Oscar's fault.

01:00:54.909 --> 01:00:57.640
Extinct dinosaurs?
Didn't you know? Oscar did it.

01:00:57.642 --> 01:01:00.074
What about the Ice Age?
Of course it was me.

01:01:00.076 --> 01:01:03.306
Who else would it have been?
Global warming? That was me too.

01:01:03.308 --> 01:01:05.407
Come on, blame me.
Blame me for everything.

01:01:05.409 --> 01:01:06.241
It's all my fault.

01:01:08.776 --> 01:01:13.841
Except... this time
it really is my fault.

01:01:13.843 --> 01:01:17.810
That baby loved me.
He really trusted me. What did I do?

01:01:18.376 --> 01:01:21.172
Oh, what kind of hare am I?

01:01:21.174 --> 01:01:24.809
Well, I was the one who lost him.
I'll be the one who finds him.

01:01:29.909 --> 01:01:32.940
Duke, buddy.
What in the world has happened to you?

01:01:32.942 --> 01:01:34.840
I don't recognize you.

01:01:34.842 --> 01:01:37.674
You want to run and hide
from danger now?

01:01:37.676 --> 01:01:39.041
Are you running away?

01:01:39.043 --> 01:01:42.107
You want to sit up there
in your warm nest, huh?

01:01:42.109 --> 01:01:46.074
No? Of course not.
But everyone left. So what?

01:01:46.076 --> 01:01:49.340
No. I'm no pelican.
I'm a donkey.

01:01:49.342 --> 01:01:51.339
I will save the baby.

01:01:51.341 --> 01:01:55.110
I will, and it will become
my greatest story ever!

01:01:59.141 --> 01:02:02.173
Well, are you proud
of yourself, tiger?

01:02:02.175 --> 01:02:05.807
You've lost a little baby.
You've lost all your friends.

01:02:05.809 --> 01:02:08.275
You are the stuff of legend, my friend.
You're a true hero.

01:02:09.209 --> 01:02:11.941
No, this just won't do.

01:02:11.943 --> 01:02:16.706
The little panda counts on you,
and you will save him, no matter what.

01:02:22.043 --> 01:02:26.873
All right. Don't try being a hero.
You won't achieve much all by yourself.

01:02:26.875 --> 01:02:29.973
Time to run home with your tail
between your legs.

01:02:29.975 --> 01:02:34.407
I'm surprised you made it this far,
to be completely honest with you.

01:02:34.409 --> 01:02:39.172
Oh. You think you're so
special because you found a track.

01:02:39.174 --> 01:02:41.806
Who do you think you are, K9?

01:02:41.808 --> 01:02:44.741
Let's go back home, so we can live
a wonderful, safe life together,

01:02:44.743 --> 01:02:46.944
like the true cowards
we are.

01:02:47.909 --> 01:02:50.741
No! You do not exist.
Do you hear me?

01:02:50.743 --> 01:02:53.406
You're not real.
Go away and leave me alone.

01:02:53.408 --> 01:02:55.841
Get away. Go away.
Leave me alone.

01:02:55.843 --> 01:02:57.406
No, no, no, no,
no. No, no, no...

01:02:57.408 --> 01:02:59.139
Who are you fighting
there, Janus?

01:02:59.141 --> 01:03:00.374
...no, no...

01:03:00.376 --> 01:03:03.641
Uh, nobody. Just practicing.

01:03:03.643 --> 01:03:06.306
And what exactly
are you practicing for?

01:03:09.943 --> 01:03:12.909
Wait, Mic-Mic.
Listen up, guys, I...

01:03:13.676 --> 01:03:14.977
I... I want to tell you...

01:03:16.075 --> 01:03:18.310
It's... It's all my fault.

01:03:20.142 --> 01:03:22.640
Ha! What else is new?

01:03:22.642 --> 01:03:25.106
My dear friends, please.
No fighting.

01:03:25.108 --> 01:03:27.906
Hot tempers
will not solve anything.

01:03:27.908 --> 01:03:30.976
We need to work together
if we want to save the baby.

01:03:38.943 --> 01:03:41.340
We need to come up with a plan.

01:03:41.342 --> 01:03:45.073
Have I ever told you the story
of the Battle of Trafalgar?

01:03:45.075 --> 01:03:46.877
Huh?

01:03:55.808 --> 01:03:58.609
What? I'm not good at charades.
What are you guys saying?

01:04:05.209 --> 01:04:07.643
So? A hedgehog stretched
and jumped into the ocean?

01:04:14.742 --> 01:04:17.776
They tied a rope
into a sailor's knot?

01:04:25.975 --> 01:04:28.106
The sun is finally out,
and the waves are gone?

01:04:28.108 --> 01:04:29.075
No.

01:04:31.042 --> 01:04:33.806
They're trying to tell us
that the baby was taken

01:04:33.808 --> 01:04:37.876
by a very large
and very long snake.

01:04:39.108 --> 01:04:43.740
Yes, a very, very
large snake. Huge.

01:04:43.742 --> 01:04:46.306
What do you mean,
a large snake? A python?

01:04:49.408 --> 01:04:51.843
Do you have any idea where
they might have taken the baby?

01:04:55.775 --> 01:04:56.976
Follow them!

01:05:15.842 --> 01:05:18.272
There's no need to cry.

01:05:18.274 --> 01:05:21.640
You won't taste as good
if you cry too much.

01:05:21.642 --> 01:05:23.709
Don't spoil the meat.

01:05:26.775 --> 01:05:28.840
Ah.

01:05:28.842 --> 01:05:31.373
Poor baby is hungry.

01:05:31.375 --> 01:05:35.876
Well, don't worry.
Dinner is almost ready.

01:05:37.409 --> 01:05:43.707
And you have the honor
of being the main course.

01:05:48.376 --> 01:05:53.072
It sounds like
we have company.

01:05:53.074 --> 01:05:57.740
Stay here, and don't you dare
try to escape, little one.

01:06:02.009 --> 01:06:06.006
Hey, Duke, is it true that a
footless, yellow earthworm lives here?

01:06:06.008 --> 01:06:08.740
Oh, yes, that's right.

01:06:08.742 --> 01:06:11.139
He also goes by
"speckled frog."

01:06:11.141 --> 01:06:14.140
Is he really
as stupid as they say he is?

01:06:14.142 --> 01:06:16.040
Yes.

01:06:16.042 --> 01:06:19.073
And if there were ever
an Olympics for idiots,

01:06:19.075 --> 01:06:21.207
he would be
the unrivaled champion.

01:06:23.676 --> 01:06:26.940
You think that's funny.

01:06:26.942 --> 01:06:28.810
All right, then...

01:06:34.743 --> 01:06:36.743
Hello there.

01:06:50.309 --> 01:06:52.176
It's time!

01:06:55.908 --> 01:06:59.943
- You go ahead.
- I'll catch up with you soon.

01:07:10.142 --> 01:07:13.240
Now, watch me closely.

01:07:13.242 --> 01:07:16.109
Listen to me very carefully.

01:07:16.907 --> 01:07:20.373
From now on, I am your master.

01:07:20.375 --> 01:07:23.805
You will obey me
and do exactly as I tell you...

01:07:23.807 --> 01:07:24.940
Hey, dum-dum.

01:07:24.942 --> 01:07:27.706
You, David Blaine.

01:07:27.708 --> 01:07:30.339
You gotta stop with your magic tricks
now because no one's buying it.

01:07:30.341 --> 01:07:31.576
Hypnotize this!

01:07:35.376 --> 01:07:36.975
Owsie!

01:07:39.175 --> 01:07:41.040
Yes.

01:07:50.376 --> 01:07:54.107
What's wrong, Mr. Tough Guy?
Does your hand hurt?

01:07:56.141 --> 01:07:59.142
Don't worry.
It will stop hurting.

01:08:00.409 --> 01:08:03.172
You overstretched hot dog!

01:08:03.174 --> 01:08:04.709
Let my friend go!

01:08:17.707 --> 01:08:21.109
Well, you asked for it,
long ears.

01:08:25.008 --> 01:08:28.106
Look who's there.
A striped kitten.

01:08:28.108 --> 01:08:30.876
Well, wait.
I'll get to you too.

01:08:46.907 --> 01:08:50.738
"Finally I found out
that my friends are all around.

01:08:50.741 --> 01:08:54.307
There's a grumpy bear
who could try to keep it down.

01:08:54.309 --> 01:08:58.674
And a cheerful hare
who is funny like a clown.

01:08:58.676 --> 01:09:02.276
And there's a feathered
storyteller with the largest beak.

01:09:11.341 --> 01:09:13.805
And also there's
a gentle wolf...

01:09:13.807 --> 01:09:15.173
who's too scared...

01:09:17.209 --> 01:09:19.906
...to speak."

01:09:23.841 --> 01:09:27.673
Janus,
don't even think about it.

01:09:27.675 --> 01:09:31.038
Are you seriously considering
helping this stripy Shakespeare?

01:09:31.041 --> 01:09:33.072
Don't be a fool.

01:09:33.073 --> 01:09:38.805
Run away while you still can.
Trust me, it's not your fight, Janus.

01:09:38.808 --> 01:09:41.773
Stop it. I've had enough of you.
You're not even real.

01:09:41.774 --> 01:09:43.904
And this is where
you're wrong, buddy.

01:09:43.907 --> 01:09:46.872
I am real,
and you are not.

01:09:46.874 --> 01:09:48.875
You're nothing
but a reflection of me.

01:09:50.841 --> 01:09:53.706
No, I'm not. This is enough.

01:09:53.707 --> 01:09:55.943
I'm done being scared.
Do you hear me?

01:09:57.075 --> 01:10:00.742
I am not afraid anymore.

01:10:13.074 --> 01:10:15.873
Wow! I'm not Janus anymore.

01:10:15.875 --> 01:10:17.740
I'm Jackie Chanus!

01:10:19.242 --> 01:10:20.842
Huh?

01:10:31.742 --> 01:10:33.776
"They always help me
without fail.

01:10:37.242 --> 01:10:40.209
Why don't you get off my tail?

01:10:55.642 --> 01:10:58.109
And I love them just the same."

01:11:19.042 --> 01:11:21.206
Hmm.

01:11:21.208 --> 01:11:23.276
Why don't we call it a draw?

01:11:24.841 --> 01:11:27.775
Yeah, right.
Dream on, fang-face. No way!

01:11:30.974 --> 01:11:34.406
Let me go right this second.

01:11:34.408 --> 01:11:37.740
You want me to let you go?
I could do that.

01:11:41.741 --> 01:11:43.940
So long, fang-face.

01:11:48.309 --> 01:11:50.043
Here, I let go.

01:11:50.908 --> 01:11:52.940
Sayonara, sucker!

01:12:04.641 --> 01:12:07.608
I found him.
I saved our little guy.

01:12:09.342 --> 01:12:11.672
Little bun-face, you okay?

01:12:21.874 --> 01:12:24.007
Well done, dude.

01:12:24.009 --> 01:12:26.273
And you, Janus.
You did good too.

01:12:26.275 --> 01:12:28.072
We wouldn't have won
if it wasn't for you.

01:12:28.074 --> 01:12:29.739
Thanks for your help.

01:12:29.741 --> 01:12:32.339
We never could have beat this
fire hose without you, pal.

01:12:32.341 --> 01:12:35.306
You know,
I felt brave enough to jump in

01:12:35.308 --> 01:12:37.839
only because Oscar and Amur
showed me what bravery was.

01:12:37.841 --> 01:12:41.309
By the way, uh, where is Oscar?

01:12:43.642 --> 01:12:44.609
Mic-Mic?

01:12:47.642 --> 01:12:48.776
Where's the python?

01:12:49.675 --> 01:12:50.841
Very far from here.

01:12:52.241 --> 01:12:54.708
Thank you, Oscar.
You saved my life.

01:12:58.109 --> 01:13:00.840
Oh, come on.
What are you talking about?

01:13:00.842 --> 01:13:02.008
Without all of you...

01:13:04.074 --> 01:13:05.575
I'm a worthless half-pint.

01:13:06.342 --> 01:13:08.406
We're all winners.

01:13:08.408 --> 01:13:12.206
We won today
because we worked together.

01:13:12.208 --> 01:13:15.106
- And now, do you guys remember...
- It was the best day...

01:13:15.108 --> 01:13:18.840
...I threw you guys over the wall,
and then you guys threw me over the wall?

01:13:30.242 --> 01:13:33.639
Where is that stork?
We've been waiting such a long time now.

01:13:33.641 --> 01:13:37.106
- Yes. I'm so worried.
- Mm. Mm.

01:13:43.409 --> 01:13:44.576
It's him?

01:14:15.208 --> 01:14:16.709
Son!

01:14:18.075 --> 01:14:20.876
- My baby.
- Mommy.

01:14:27.008 --> 01:14:28.275
Daddy.

01:14:29.309 --> 01:14:30.876
Our son.

01:14:37.808 --> 01:14:41.406
All right, well, uh,
what's the plan now, guys?

01:14:41.408 --> 01:14:44.273
I think I'll stay here
for a while.

01:14:44.275 --> 01:14:48.172
You see, I finally
have found my audience.

01:14:48.174 --> 01:14:50.006
They don't interrupt.
They don't argue.

01:14:50.008 --> 01:14:52.972
They believe me.
What else could I ask for?

01:14:52.974 --> 01:14:56.073
And besides,
now I have a true story.

01:14:56.075 --> 01:14:58.973
I'm going to stay here
as well,

01:14:58.975 --> 01:15:02.706
and I'm going to write the
greatest poem about our adventure.

01:15:02.708 --> 01:15:04.673
And I'm going back
to my pack.

01:15:04.675 --> 01:15:07.143
The elections are coming,
and I want to run for alpha male.

01:15:08.109 --> 01:15:10.207
Uh, good luck, then.

01:15:10.209 --> 01:15:13.609
Well, Oscar and I are going
back to our forest.

01:15:14.808 --> 01:15:17.107
Yep, time to go home.

01:15:17.109 --> 01:15:19.676
Little guy,
come give Uncle Oscar a hug.

01:15:24.275 --> 01:15:26.139
Oscar.

01:15:26.141 --> 01:15:30.576
Our baby's talking!
Did you hear? He said my name.

01:15:31.774 --> 01:15:32.776
Mic-Mic.

01:15:34.408 --> 01:15:36.039
Um...

01:15:36.041 --> 01:15:37.906
Well, um...

01:15:37.908 --> 01:15:41.175
make sure you come visit us
when you grow up, all right?

01:15:43.042 --> 01:15:46.805
Um, you guys can come too, of course.
We have a great forest.

01:15:46.807 --> 01:15:48.705
And loads of honey.

01:15:48.707 --> 01:15:51.939
Thank you.
We'll come visit sometime.

01:15:51.941 --> 01:15:54.042
And you are always
welcome here.

01:16:14.109 --> 01:16:15.905
Have a safe journey.

01:16:15.907 --> 01:16:19.042
Oscar! Mic-Mic!

01:16:47.340 --> 01:16:49.875
Home, sweet home.

01:16:54.708 --> 01:16:58.207
That was a big trip.

01:16:58.209 --> 01:17:02.007
My paws hurt.

01:17:05.208 --> 01:17:08.940
Uh...

01:17:08.942 --> 01:17:12.975
Well, guess I'll be going then.
It was nice traveling with you, Mic-Mic.

01:17:19.875 --> 01:17:21.043
Hey, Oscar.

01:17:21.774 --> 01:17:24.305
Yeah? What?

01:17:24.307 --> 01:17:26.205
Stay at my place for the night,

01:17:26.207 --> 01:17:28.775
and we'll start building
a new house for you tomorrow.

01:17:30.141 --> 01:17:31.306
No kidding?

01:17:31.308 --> 01:17:34.642
Well, of course.
We're friends, dude.

01:17:35.241 --> 01:17:37.342
We're friends? Are you sure?

01:17:38.341 --> 01:17:39.976
There's no doubt about it.

01:17:40.808 --> 01:17:42.342
Age before beauty.

01:17:43.274 --> 01:17:46.042
Hmm. <i>Entrez.</i>

01:18:27.642 --> 01:18:29.373
What is it? Huh?

01:18:38.375 --> 01:18:40.842
Ah! Oscar?

01:18:45.708 --> 01:18:46.973
What is it?

01:18:46.975 --> 01:18:48.142
Huh?

01:18:49.041 --> 01:18:49.976
Oh, my!

01:18:50.975 --> 01:18:53.271
Huh?

01:19:01.174 --> 01:19:03.639
Oh, no!

01:19:03.641 --> 01:19:05.940
Not again!

01:19:05.942 --> 01:19:09.040
Unbelievable! I guess
we'd better call it in.

01:19:09.042 --> 01:19:11.840
Ask the stork delivery service
for a membership discount.

01:19:19.074 --> 01:19:24.174
No more crying babies!

01:19:25.041 --> 01:19:27.373
Oscar!

01:19:27.375 --> 01:19:29.808
No more, dude.
I don't like them.
