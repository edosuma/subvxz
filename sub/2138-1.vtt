01:33.640 --> 01:37.201
- Baby, check this out.
- A power washer?

01:37.920 --> 01:38.967
We need one of these.

01:39.080 --> 01:40.161
Yeah.

01:40.360 --> 01:42.442
- On the patio in the backyard.
- Yeah.

01:42.560 --> 01:44.320
Should we go look
at those window treatments?

01:44.480 --> 01:45.641
No.

01:45.840 --> 01:47.524
Do you want one of these hotdogs?

01:47.960 --> 01:49.007
They're very good.

01:49.200 --> 01:52.966
Baby, you are a heck of a homemaker.

01:53.440 --> 01:57.331
You know that?
But we could just go to dinner.

02:00.880 --> 02:02.086
Well, you know,

02:02.520 --> 02:03.681
if you don't make it...

02:03.880 --> 02:05.723
You don't eat it.

02:06.880 --> 02:09.565
You know what? That's a great idea.
What if I make you dinner?

02:10.400 --> 02:14.724
I'm gonna go and get that, uh, grill.
The big shiny one.

02:15.000 --> 02:17.128
Will you get us some shrimp?
The big jumbo kind.

02:18.200 --> 02:20.441
Four down. Three over.

02:20.880 --> 02:23.406
Come back and find me down here. In tools.

02:27.000 --> 02:28.843
What the hell are you doing here?

02:31.000 --> 02:32.764
You ignored my messages.

02:33.000 --> 02:34.206
I am happy.

02:34.400 --> 02:35.481
You're desperate.

02:35.680 --> 02:38.570
- I can make this work.
- Frank, you're playing house.

02:39.160 --> 02:42.562
Look, I'm retired, okay.
I'm happy. We are happy.

02:42.920 --> 02:44.445
Frank... Frank...

02:44.800 --> 02:47.121
You haven't killed anybody in months.

02:47.320 --> 02:49.607
That is not a bad thing, okay?

02:49.800 --> 02:51.882
That's a positive thing
for a lot of people.

02:52.080 --> 02:54.811
Kemosabe, I need you.
They're coming. I can feel it.

02:55.000 --> 02:56.365
You are driving me nuts, Marvin.

02:56.560 --> 02:58.881
Listen, if it makes you feel better,
bring the girl.

02:59.480 --> 03:01.119
I'm not gonna bring the girl anywhere,
all right?

03:01.120 --> 03:03.799
Don't bring the girl where?

03:03.800 --> 03:05.848
Oh, we're just catching up.

03:06.080 --> 03:07.799
Marvin's here. I just bumped into Marvin.

03:07.800 --> 03:08.926
Where are we going?

03:09.040 --> 03:10.371
No, come on. They're gonna close.

03:10.800 --> 03:12.040
Good to see you, Marvin.

03:12.880 --> 03:15.008
- Good to see you.
- Frank.

03:17.680 --> 03:18.801
You know you want to.

03:18.920 --> 03:20.445
- No.
- Come on.

03:20.800 --> 03:22.086
Last chance, Frank.

03:22.520 --> 03:24.170
I'm taking Sarah home.

03:27.280 --> 03:28.566
Stay safe.

03:28.920 --> 03:32.686
- Well, I really wanted to be...
- Of course, it is, honey.

03:32.880 --> 03:35.645
You are never gonna be
in danger ever again.

03:49.880 --> 03:51.769
We don't even know what happened.

03:52.160 --> 03:53.685
We don't know who's in there.

03:56.000 --> 03:57.445
How am I gonna protect you?

04:02.360 --> 04:05.125
Hey. He was your best friend.

04:06.400 --> 04:07.526
Okay?

04:08.320 --> 04:09.606
Come on.

04:35.640 --> 04:36.721
Wow.

04:37.960 --> 04:40.930
He still looks so lifelike.

04:41.120 --> 04:42.919
He's not dead.

04:42.920 --> 04:46.003
Honey, don't do that.
Just let your feelings out. Don't...

04:46.200 --> 04:47.645
No. Really.

04:48.120 --> 04:49.531
He does this a lot.

05:11.560 --> 05:12.686
Really?

05:16.600 --> 05:19.365
No, come on. Give me the pin.
Give me the pin.

05:19.560 --> 05:22.519
Come on, sweetie.
Let's go sit down. Come on.

05:22.520 --> 05:23.799
- Come on.
- I should kiss him.

05:23.800 --> 05:25.802
Yeah, go ahead. Do you want to?

05:26.600 --> 05:29.809
Let's go sit down. Come on.
Come on, sweetie.

05:34.760 --> 05:36.808
At this time, we'll open
the floor to anyone

05:36.920 --> 05:41.130
who wishes to say a few words
about the deceased.

05:42.760 --> 05:43.839
Babe...

05:43.840 --> 05:46.001
Share a memory, perhaps?

05:47.240 --> 05:50.289
Perhaps, a poem. A song lyric.

05:50.760 --> 05:51.886
Anyone?

05:53.120 --> 05:54.281
You can do it.

05:55.120 --> 05:56.201
Sir?

06:15.720 --> 06:17.802
Marvin was

06:20.040 --> 06:21.201
different.

06:22.800 --> 06:23.881
He was

06:25.160 --> 06:26.571
a very good shot.

06:28.120 --> 06:29.485
Some would say that

06:30.800 --> 06:31.847
he was paranoid.

06:33.760 --> 06:38.719
But you have to expect a little of that
when the CIA's dosing you with LSD

06:38.720 --> 06:41.087
for a little more than a decade.

06:42.400 --> 06:44.129
He could wire a bomb

06:45.800 --> 06:47.802
faster than anybody I ever met.

06:50.840 --> 06:53.764
The good people of Moldova will always

06:54.600 --> 06:56.011
be in Marvin's debt.

07:04.200 --> 07:06.089
He was a really good friend.

07:07.640 --> 07:08.971
Really good.

07:10.080 --> 07:11.445
I'm gonna miss him.

07:12.640 --> 07:13.766
Gonna miss him.

07:15.800 --> 07:17.450
- We have to move.
- Canada?

07:17.640 --> 07:20.849
High ground. Good kill zones.
It's a little farm.

07:21.840 --> 07:25.049
- A farm? Like, to farm on?
- Yeah. Yeah.

07:25.240 --> 07:26.651
Like, with crops?

07:27.000 --> 07:28.331
Yeah. It could be fun.

07:28.520 --> 07:30.090
Listen, babe...

07:30.280 --> 07:33.841
You know they say it's really
important not to make big...

07:34.040 --> 07:38.204
life-altering decisions right after a loss.

07:38.400 --> 07:42.086
If they can get to Marvin,
they can get to you and they can get to me.

07:47.400 --> 07:48.731
Who are they?

07:50.760 --> 07:52.039
Go to the safe house.

07:52.040 --> 07:53.849
Look at me. Go to the safe house.

07:54.040 --> 07:55.883
I'll come find you, okay?

07:56.120 --> 07:57.645
- I'm not leaving you.
- Listen...

07:58.000 --> 07:59.161
It'll be all right.

07:59.360 --> 08:00.439
What is it?

08:00.440 --> 08:01.487
Mr. Moses...

08:02.000 --> 08:04.287
They want to debrief you
at a Yankee White facility.

08:04.480 --> 08:05.720
Is that your sniper?

08:05.960 --> 08:08.201
You're flagged Retired Extremely Dangerous.

08:22.920 --> 08:24.079
Hi, there.

08:24.080 --> 08:26.447
Um, my client Frank Moses is here.

08:26.840 --> 08:29.679
He's an American citizen being detained
illegally without due process.

08:29.680 --> 08:31.599
- You know what? That is a lovely blazer.
- Oh, thank you.

08:31.600 --> 08:32.719
You're welcome.

08:32.720 --> 08:34.119
I'm sorry, I have no idea.

08:34.120 --> 08:35.519
But let me get Mr. Snyder for you.

08:35.520 --> 08:36.645
Thank you.

08:42.520 --> 08:43.599
How can I help you?

08:43.600 --> 08:46.119
- Oh, hi, there. I'm sorry. What is your name?
- John Snyder.

08:46.120 --> 08:47.599
John. You know what? I
didn't get your name.

08:47.600 --> 08:49.399
- Oh, it's Kelly.
- Hi, Kelly.

08:51.440 --> 08:52.441
John...

08:52.960 --> 08:54.530
John... John!

08:55.760 --> 08:57.119
Unless you want to end up like Kelly,

08:57.120 --> 08:59.726
I suggest you tell me where
Frank Moses is right now.

09:00.800 --> 09:01.847
Now!

09:02.400 --> 09:03.799
In interrogation.

09:03.800 --> 09:05.086
Ah!

09:06.120 --> 09:09.647
I got a document right here that says that
you have a special interest in the Cold War.

09:10.680 --> 09:13.684
We know that back in the day,
you spent an awful lotta time in Russia.

09:14.240 --> 09:17.164
I just need to know what you
know about Project Nightshade.

09:18.360 --> 09:20.239
I really don't know anything about it.

09:25.600 --> 09:27.011
What the hell is that?

09:27.320 --> 09:29.800
Small arms gunfire, 200 yards.

09:31.400 --> 09:32.401
Watch him.

09:34.160 --> 09:35.446
100 yards.

09:35.800 --> 09:37.131
They're coming to kill us.

09:38.680 --> 09:40.091
Get me outta these cuffs.

09:40.280 --> 09:41.611
I can't do that, sir.

09:42.080 --> 09:43.320
You have the key, right?

09:45.360 --> 09:46.600
Hands up!

09:47.000 --> 09:48.047
50 feet.

09:48.480 --> 09:51.080
They're gonna kill us both,
if you don't get me outta these cuffs.

09:56.160 --> 09:57.321
Come on.

10:08.440 --> 10:10.363
Frank Moses.

10:11.400 --> 10:14.563
You know, coming up through
the ranks, you were my hero.

10:16.240 --> 10:18.959
Given enough time, I guess everyone cracks.

10:18.960 --> 10:19.961
Huh, Frank?

10:23.000 --> 10:24.359
- Who are you?
- Me?

10:24.360 --> 10:25.361
Mmm-hmm.

10:25.720 --> 10:28.087
I'm the guy the government
hires to get information.

10:28.920 --> 10:32.447
And I'm allowed to use any
form of torture I deem fit.

10:33.040 --> 10:36.010
And I will torture Sarah until you speak.

10:38.800 --> 10:42.441
Speaking of Sarah, I love watching her

10:42.640 --> 10:45.530
shave her legs in the tub.

10:46.240 --> 10:49.801
Kinda reminds me of these Belgian mercs
I met in the Congo.

10:50.160 --> 10:54.324
They would skin people alive
to get them to talk.

10:54.920 --> 10:56.410
And do you know where they started?

10:57.200 --> 10:58.201
Guess.

11:01.160 --> 11:05.449
At the ankles. Just like your Sarah.

11:07.000 --> 11:08.047
So...

11:13.080 --> 11:15.811
You either give me the information
that I need to know...

11:17.680 --> 11:21.605
Or I'm gonna fillet your girl
from head to toe with no mercy.

11:24.280 --> 11:25.520
Awesome.

11:41.120 --> 11:42.121
Wow.

11:42.560 --> 11:44.767
Pretty good for a retired guy.
But are you...

11:44.960 --> 11:46.039
1-2-3-4-5-6...

11:46.040 --> 11:48.122
7-on-1 cuffed with no weapon good?

11:53.160 --> 11:54.321
Son of a...

11:54.440 --> 11:56.522
Go. Go, go, go!

11:58.200 --> 11:59.565
Shoot him, but don't kill him.

12:05.360 --> 12:07.203
All right, kill him. Spray it up.

12:10.440 --> 12:12.204
Frank, this is your last chance.

12:12.400 --> 12:13.640
Fire.

12:57.800 --> 12:59.006
Get in there! Go!

14:05.480 --> 14:06.845
Shit.

14:29.000 --> 14:30.081
Marvin!

14:30.680 --> 14:33.206
- You're driving me crazy!
- I brought the key.

14:36.840 --> 14:38.205
You faked your death.

14:39.440 --> 14:41.283
- Gotta go.
- Let's go.

14:41.760 --> 14:42.761
Gotta go.

14:43.480 --> 14:45.642
You have no idea
what you put me through!

14:50.440 --> 14:51.919
Oh! Thank God, you're okay.

14:51.920 --> 14:52.921
No!

14:53.120 --> 14:56.761
- What are you doing here?
- Marvin brought me. From the house.

14:58.800 --> 15:01.079
Has everybody lost their mind?

15:01.080 --> 15:04.687
- Marv, you don't bring a girl like that here.
- I had to see if you were okay, didn't I?

15:05.240 --> 15:06.359
Honey!

15:06.360 --> 15:08.169
I thought...
What?

15:09.520 --> 15:12.842
Remember when we had that conversation
about how you were gonna lay low?

15:13.040 --> 15:14.883
You don't get to tell me when to lay.

15:15.400 --> 15:17.050
I mean, I'm not saying that.

15:18.240 --> 15:21.164
Stop. Just don't. Just don't... No.

15:21.360 --> 15:24.125
- You're mad at me now?
- You treat me like a China doll.

15:24.360 --> 15:26.679
Frank, can I give you
a little advice about women?

15:26.680 --> 15:27.841
No! Absolutely not!

15:28.200 --> 15:30.039
Listen, you gotta ask yourself,

15:30.040 --> 15:33.079
what is a girl like that
doing with a guy like you?

15:33.080 --> 15:34.844
It ain't for your looks.

15:35.040 --> 15:37.884
You know, I will shoot you.
I will shoot you in the liver.

15:41.320 --> 15:47.119
Adventure, romance, danger,
activities you can share as a couple.

15:47.120 --> 15:49.043
It's about you lying to me.

15:49.400 --> 15:50.447
Frank...

15:52.360 --> 15:55.364
I was very touched that you cried
at my funeral.

16:04.480 --> 16:05.766
That's not true.

16:07.320 --> 16:08.924
I didn't cry at your funeral.

16:09.560 --> 16:11.050
I'm no crier.

16:17.400 --> 16:20.927
Ninety-six hours ago,
somebody posted a document on the Internet

16:21.040 --> 16:25.489
that said you and I took part in an
operation called Nightshade back in '79.

16:25.920 --> 16:27.559
That's why you fake died?

16:27.560 --> 16:30.086
Yeah. The chatter went through the roof.

16:30.880 --> 16:34.359
So everybody's after you
for something they think you know

16:34.360 --> 16:36.362
that you don't even know at all?

16:40.160 --> 16:42.759
Oh, my God! Spiders!

16:42.760 --> 16:45.366
Honey, you need to go to ground
and it's best I don't know where.

16:45.480 --> 16:47.199
Yeah, I'm not going anywhere.

16:47.200 --> 16:51.524
- Cash only. No calls. No contacts.
- Thanks. Look...

16:52.240 --> 16:56.879
I'm not hanging out in some bunker
while you slink around and save the planet

16:56.880 --> 16:59.439
with dusky international femme fatales.

16:59.440 --> 17:01.599
- Dusky?
- Dark, smoldering.

17:01.600 --> 17:03.250
I know what it means, Marvin.

17:05.760 --> 17:09.638
It's hard to be the kinda person
I have to be right now

17:09.640 --> 17:13.281
and do the kinda things that I'm going
to have to do while you're here.

17:13.480 --> 17:15.130
This is gonna be good for us.

17:15.720 --> 17:16.878
What are we doing?

17:16.880 --> 17:19.999
Let's face it, Columbo,
things were getting a little stale.

17:20.000 --> 17:24.118
Wow. Mommy just slapped Daddy
at the dinner table.

17:29.880 --> 17:32.839
Is there a human being
in the trunk?

17:32.840 --> 17:33.887
Yeah.

17:36.200 --> 17:37.645
Who is it, Marvin?

17:39.320 --> 17:42.802
He's a Senior Director of
Military Intelligence.

17:43.840 --> 17:47.208
I've been caramelizing his onions
for a couple of days.

17:47.400 --> 17:48.640
Caramelizing how?

17:49.080 --> 17:52.323
With three tabs of acid and a lot of rats.

17:53.080 --> 17:54.411
Dang!

17:56.200 --> 18:01.366
Eleven people dead. Five FBI.
And the SecDef wants a briefing?

18:01.920 --> 18:03.649
You were brought in to contain this.

18:04.800 --> 18:05.801
Calm down.

18:06.000 --> 18:08.162
I can't believe this is coming back on me
after so many years.

18:08.360 --> 18:11.639
General, Moses and Boggs
have been completely isolated.

18:11.640 --> 18:13.679
The FBI is seeking them for the murders.

18:13.680 --> 18:16.889
Homeland has been informed that they
are officially domestic terrorists.

18:17.200 --> 18:18.359
Is that gonna work?

18:18.360 --> 18:19.407
Yes.

18:19.840 --> 18:23.639
The problem is with that document
surfacing on the Internet,

18:23.640 --> 18:26.086
all the players will be
coming after Nightshade.

18:30.720 --> 18:32.404
It'll open the book on this.

18:32.920 --> 18:36.208
I'm calling SecDef. We need to go public.

18:38.720 --> 18:39.960
General...

18:46.280 --> 18:47.850
Nobody's going public.

18:48.600 --> 18:50.640
We need a new plan for Moses.

18:50.880 --> 18:52.723
I need you to approve a specialist.

18:53.000 --> 18:54.159
What? CIA?

18:54.160 --> 18:56.891
It's been tried, sir.
Didn't work so well for those guys.

18:59.320 --> 19:01.719
Han Cho Bai. He's the best.

19:01.720 --> 19:02.767
Do it.

19:25.960 --> 19:27.246
Suit, too.

19:31.680 --> 19:33.011
Okay, he's clean.

19:41.840 --> 19:42.841
Seriously?

19:59.040 --> 20:00.883
Sit down, Mr. Han.

20:13.280 --> 20:15.442
Your security is impressive.

20:17.960 --> 20:19.803
A business associate.

20:20.120 --> 20:22.771
Julio Alvarez Fernandes.

20:22.960 --> 20:25.531
Very difficult to get close to.

20:26.520 --> 20:29.171
Of course, it must appear like an accident.

20:29.960 --> 20:33.159
Not a problem. Except for one thing.

20:33.160 --> 20:34.286
Mmm?

20:36.040 --> 20:39.567
Mr. Fernandes pays better.

21:00.880 --> 21:01.927
Yeah?

21:02.360 --> 21:03.361
<i>Who's the target?</i>

21:03.560 --> 21:06.086
Oh, it's an old pal of yours. Frank Moses.

21:13.480 --> 21:15.608
Karma's a bitch, Frank.

21:26.120 --> 21:27.360
What is this?

21:27.560 --> 21:29.519
There's a watchword flag
on a WikiLeaks document.

21:29.520 --> 21:31.682
It's coded Priority One Alpha Seven.

21:32.720 --> 21:35.041
- Something called Nightshade.
- Shut up!

21:37.920 --> 21:38.921
Get out.

21:44.960 --> 21:47.247
Find me Victoria Winslow.

21:58.160 --> 21:59.764
Director Philips?

22:00.160 --> 22:01.525
Um...

22:02.080 --> 22:03.969
I'm with someone right now.

22:13.680 --> 22:15.250
Keeping busy, I see.

22:16.160 --> 22:18.242
Idle hands do the Devil's work.

22:21.200 --> 22:22.361
Yes.

22:23.520 --> 22:26.599
I understand you can get close
to Frank Moses.

22:26.600 --> 22:27.601
Yes.

22:28.040 --> 22:30.042
MI6 has a job for you.

22:30.400 --> 22:32.926
If you want to stay alive,
you're going to accept it.

22:33.760 --> 22:36.604
It's time to choose sides, Victoria.

22:42.640 --> 22:45.041
Where do they
teach you guys this stuff?

22:47.480 --> 22:49.599
Manuals, mostly.

22:49.600 --> 22:51.011
Mmm.

22:52.720 --> 22:55.121
Some of this stuff you just can't teach.

22:55.720 --> 22:56.721
Wow.

22:57.800 --> 22:59.370
Isn't this cool?

23:00.240 --> 23:01.969
We're on a mission together.

23:02.160 --> 23:05.119
Do you have any idea how many people
are trying to kill us right now?

23:05.120 --> 23:07.639
You and I both know
that this is where you belong.

23:07.640 --> 23:09.519
Right here. In the thick of it.

23:09.520 --> 23:11.522
Pussy Cat's right, Frank.

23:12.080 --> 23:13.206
Here we go.

23:14.360 --> 23:15.486
Watch your step.

23:15.880 --> 23:17.086
What?

23:17.480 --> 23:18.527
Oh.

23:19.040 --> 23:20.451
Come on!

23:21.600 --> 23:25.127
- Where did you get this?
- Um... Marvin.

23:27.200 --> 23:30.879
- You gave her a gun?
- It is America, Frank.

23:30.880 --> 23:33.804
Everyone else has a gun.

23:34.640 --> 23:37.849
She has no idea what to do with this.

23:38.040 --> 23:39.319
I know exactly what to do with it.

23:39.320 --> 23:40.765
Ow!

23:48.000 --> 23:53.006
You don't give fire to a kitten.

23:54.960 --> 23:57.167
Why don't you just give her
some dynamite, Marvin?

23:58.200 --> 24:00.328
No external safety on the Sig?

24:08.040 --> 24:09.610
Tell him what you told me.

24:09.840 --> 24:11.239
At the height of the Cold War,

24:11.240 --> 24:13.879
Nightshade was cooked up
by a rogue US general

24:13.880 --> 24:16.519
as a first strike capability
against the Soviets.

24:16.520 --> 24:18.249
- That's it. Can I go?
- That's it?

24:18.440 --> 24:21.679
- You want a little pepper with that?
- No, okay! At the height of the Cold War,

24:21.680 --> 24:24.839
a megaton-yield device
was smuggled into Moscow

24:24.840 --> 24:29.039
in diplomatic pouches, piece by piece,
and then the weapon was lost. That's it.

24:29.040 --> 24:30.804
You lost a nuke in Moscow?

24:31.680 --> 24:35.651
The scientist was Edward Bailey. That's it.

24:40.120 --> 24:41.121
What?

24:42.160 --> 24:43.525
I made a mistake.

24:44.320 --> 24:49.159
Edward Bailey was a genius physicist
who built some of the greatest stuff

24:49.160 --> 24:50.519
during the Cold War.

24:50.520 --> 24:55.606
Neutron bombs, particle beam weapons,
nerve gas. Excellent nerve gas.

24:55.720 --> 25:00.319
He was a rock star of
conceptual mass killing.

25:00.320 --> 25:02.402
They called him "The Da Vinci of Death."

25:02.760 --> 25:07.239
We were the security detail assigned to
getting him in and out of Moscow safely.

25:07.240 --> 25:08.366
What happened?

25:10.920 --> 25:14.641
We thought he was secure.
The Soviets got him with a car bomb.

25:15.600 --> 25:17.011
It was my fault.

25:18.520 --> 25:19.601
He's dead.

25:22.440 --> 25:23.805
Run or fight?

25:26.720 --> 25:30.279
All we've got is this
WikiLeaks page off the Internet.

25:30.280 --> 25:34.001
Out of a Paris IP.

25:34.240 --> 25:37.130
Hmm. Paris could be anybody.

25:37.720 --> 25:40.610
Wait. Wait. Scroll back down for a second.

25:43.320 --> 25:45.163
- What is that?
- Oh.

25:46.680 --> 25:47.727
Uh...

25:48.600 --> 25:49.840
Coffee stain?

25:50.400 --> 25:51.606
Mmm. Wine.

25:51.920 --> 25:52.921
Frog.

25:54.920 --> 25:56.039
What?

26:01.840 --> 26:02.921
We're okay.

26:06.720 --> 26:07.721
Your number.

26:11.200 --> 26:12.439
Yeah.

26:12.440 --> 26:15.239
MI6 has just given me a
contract to kill you.

26:15.240 --> 26:18.279
Apparently, you're guilty
of nuclear terrorism, murder,

26:18.280 --> 26:20.965
and you're number one
on Interpol's Most Wanted.

26:21.360 --> 26:22.479
What did you say?

26:22.480 --> 26:23.679
<i>Oh, I said "Yes. "</i>

26:23.680 --> 26:25.199
You know, the money's good.

26:25.200 --> 26:27.120
And anyway, if I don't do it,
somebody else will.

26:27.320 --> 26:30.279
<i>Oh, and you should know the Americans
are sending someone also.</i>

26:30.280 --> 26:31.281
Who?

26:31.600 --> 26:32.761
Han.

26:34.520 --> 26:35.719
It's bad, isn't it?

26:35.720 --> 26:37.959
- Is that Marvin?
- Yes. And Sarah.

26:37.960 --> 26:39.319
<i>Aw! Send them my love, will you?</i>

26:39.320 --> 26:40.840
They're driving me crazy.

26:41.320 --> 26:42.839
Marvin gave her a gun.

26:42.840 --> 26:45.559
- Was it loaded?
- Yes! Yes!

26:45.560 --> 26:47.119
Are you being controlling?

26:47.120 --> 26:48.531
No!

26:48.840 --> 26:50.808
<i>You have to take chances in a relationship.</i>

26:51.080 --> 26:52.605
You have to be supportive.

26:53.160 --> 26:56.559
I don't need her to fit in.
I just need her to be safe.

26:56.560 --> 26:58.722
<i>Just rent</i> Dirty Dancing,
<i>tell her you love her.</i>

26:59.280 --> 27:03.126
You know, it's important to enjoy life
while you still can.

27:06.600 --> 27:10.605
Victoria just accepted a contract from MI6
to kill all three of us.

27:11.440 --> 27:15.639
You don't think she'd do that, do you?
Frank, you don't think she'd do that?

27:15.640 --> 27:17.039
She's a friend.

27:17.040 --> 27:20.919
Frank, what, are you stupid? You never
took a contract out to kill a friend?

27:20.920 --> 27:23.241
She called to give us fair warning.

27:23.680 --> 27:26.206
Come on. There's one more thing.

27:28.120 --> 27:31.399
Han just went number one.

27:31.400 --> 27:34.999
Why don't they just
dip our balls in honey

27:35.000 --> 27:37.526
and stake us to an ant farm?

27:43.760 --> 27:44.807
Come on.

27:45.200 --> 27:47.931
Whoa! Crazy old bastard.

27:49.560 --> 27:51.279
Frank, do you feel old?

27:51.280 --> 27:53.319
- Not really.
- Me neither.

27:53.320 --> 27:55.639
I mean, crazy sometimes, I guess.

27:55.640 --> 27:56.880
Who's Han?

27:57.680 --> 27:58.806
Who's Han?

28:00.280 --> 28:02.601
Korean. Counter-intel.

28:03.160 --> 28:05.599
Frank put him in jail for a few years.

28:05.600 --> 28:07.399
We should be super-scared of him, huh?

28:07.400 --> 28:10.609
Yes. He is the best contract
killer in the world.

28:21.400 --> 28:25.007
I've got a hit off an old alias,
silent for almost 20 years.

28:26.040 --> 28:27.799
He's dodging watch lists.

28:27.800 --> 28:32.601
Bingo. Private flight to Paris
scheduled for 0900 out of Teterboro.

28:33.080 --> 28:37.165
Find their hotel. Get blueprints and
workups on the day and night managers.

28:37.880 --> 28:40.087
Have Vance meet us on the ground.

28:51.920 --> 28:55.527
They're one floor down. Two adjoining rooms.
Surveillance is almost up and running.

28:56.400 --> 28:58.926
This is going to be
easier than I thought.

29:01.640 --> 29:03.961
Hello. Speaking.

29:06.040 --> 29:07.087
Yes.

29:08.120 --> 29:09.959
- Where are they?
- They were here.

29:09.960 --> 29:11.450
They ordered room service at 1:00.

29:11.680 --> 29:13.720
What do you mean,
"The plane is prepped"?

29:14.680 --> 29:16.444
I think someone stole your plane.

29:23.480 --> 29:25.926
I'm really going to enjoy killing him.

29:28.320 --> 29:32.723
Get me a gun that really hurts.

29:39.760 --> 29:41.330
So how good is this guy?

29:41.520 --> 29:44.729
Han is the best contract
killer in the world.

29:44.920 --> 29:49.323
Let's just say that Frank
is in some very, very deep dog doo.

29:49.760 --> 29:51.879
- He's not gonna kill me.
- Yeah.

29:51.880 --> 29:53.879
- Nobody kills Frank Moses.
- Right!

29:53.880 --> 29:57.679
The people he really doesn't like,
he tortures for a long time first.

29:57.680 --> 29:59.999
Can we just focus
on trying to catch The Frog?

30:00.000 --> 30:04.159
Okay. What's the action plan
for target acquisition and rendition?

30:04.160 --> 30:05.241
Marvin?

30:06.440 --> 30:08.169
Quit teaching her stuff!

30:10.240 --> 30:11.401
Nice.

30:14.160 --> 30:17.799
What do you think the most expensive
bottle of wine in the world costs?

30:17.800 --> 30:20.159
Chateau d'Yquem 1847.

30:20.160 --> 30:24.959
Maybe five, six, maybe, bottles left
in the world. It's pretty pricey.

30:24.960 --> 30:28.009
Maybe we should get a bottle of that wine
and try to catch The Frog with it.

30:36.040 --> 30:38.725
My God, this is so romantic!

30:41.600 --> 30:44.365
Come here. Keep your head down.

30:45.200 --> 30:48.283
But we have to go to the
Ile Saint-Louis for gelato.

30:48.480 --> 30:49.527
I don't think so.

30:49.840 --> 30:51.649
Really? What about the...

31:00.920 --> 31:02.959
- Frank, is that...
- Mmm-hmm.

31:02.960 --> 31:04.405
Hello, Frank.

31:06.240 --> 31:08.479
- Have you seen her since?
- Nope.

31:08.480 --> 31:10.244
God, I've missed you.

31:10.800 --> 31:11.881
Who is she?

31:12.360 --> 31:13.441
Trouble.

31:20.920 --> 31:23.002
How are things?

31:23.880 --> 31:25.882
Yeah, Frank, how are things?

31:26.480 --> 31:27.839
Sarah...

31:29.280 --> 31:30.645
This is Katja.

31:30.840 --> 31:32.365
Yeah. Hi.

31:32.720 --> 31:34.882
I need to speak with you. Immediately.

31:37.400 --> 31:38.890
What the hell was that?

31:39.000 --> 31:42.999
Katja Petrokovich.
Russian Counter-Intelligence.

31:43.000 --> 31:45.399
I think we should hear what she has to say.

31:45.400 --> 31:46.526
Frank...

31:49.200 --> 31:53.039
You don't know the half of it.
She and Frank were young.

31:53.040 --> 31:56.681
And he didn't have the slightest idea
she was working for the Russians.

31:56.880 --> 32:00.362
She's Frank Moses' kryptonite.

32:08.360 --> 32:10.966
I like you with no hair, Frank.

32:11.320 --> 32:14.529
Bald men are so sexy. Virile.

32:15.960 --> 32:17.007
Wow.

32:17.360 --> 32:18.839
She's cute.

32:18.840 --> 32:21.002
Where did you find her? Nebraska?

32:21.520 --> 32:23.602
- Kansas.
- Kansas.

32:28.280 --> 32:30.886
So what was it you wanted
to talk to me about?

32:31.800 --> 32:34.359
I would like to believe
that the US didn't plant

32:34.360 --> 32:37.682
a weapon of mass-destruction in Moscow.
But I don't.

32:38.840 --> 32:40.359
Why are you in Paris?

32:40.360 --> 32:42.362
We come every fall for Strike Season

32:42.520 --> 32:44.284
- and for the weather.
- Oh?

32:44.840 --> 32:47.650
Well, the US seems to think
you're nuclear terrorists.

32:49.240 --> 32:51.766
Russia wants complete access.

32:52.400 --> 32:56.644
You agree now or I'll hand you over
to the US government.

32:57.840 --> 32:59.888
Can't we just kill her?

33:01.320 --> 33:03.641
Excuse me for one second.
Can I talk to you?

33:03.880 --> 33:06.247
- What? Oh. Uh-huh. Sure thing.
- Come here for a minute.

33:14.560 --> 33:16.399
- You know, I was shocked.
- I got it.

33:16.400 --> 33:18.920
Yeah, I know. She was kinda counting
your teeth with her tongue.

33:20.680 --> 33:21.919
A little, yeah.

33:21.920 --> 33:23.251
Can she go now?

33:23.640 --> 33:26.484
We don't really have a choice.
We need her to help us.

33:26.720 --> 33:29.121
I promise there is nothing between us.

33:32.200 --> 33:34.719
No, sir. This guy's not giving us anything.

33:34.720 --> 33:36.290
Website's been scrubbed.

33:36.640 --> 33:39.959
NSA intercepted a dispatch
to the Kremlin from Paris.

33:39.960 --> 33:42.759
Moses is going after someone
called "The Frog."

33:44.560 --> 33:45.686
The Frog.

33:48.200 --> 33:52.091
So they call him "The Frog"
because he's French?

33:52.200 --> 33:53.690
No.

33:54.440 --> 33:57.330
No, he poisoned the water supply
at KGB headquarters

33:57.880 --> 34:00.167
with the Amazon tree frog poison.

34:00.720 --> 34:04.770
He must have been wiping
those little tree humpers for years.

34:05.720 --> 34:10.203
Incapacitated 1,600 people and left
with every secret we had.

34:10.600 --> 34:14.206
You know, the guy makes a fortune
selling information.

34:14.320 --> 34:16.846
He knows so much
even the US won't touch him.

34:18.199 --> 34:20.487
The hard part is gonna be taking him alive.

34:42.840 --> 34:45.399
- Superb.
- Wine is wine.

34:45.400 --> 34:47.641
I want to buy American
air defense protocols.

34:48.320 --> 34:51.998
Why is it terrorists
never appreciate Burgundy?

34:52.000 --> 34:53.478
Look, I don't think you know

34:53.480 --> 34:54.639
who you're dealing with.

34:54.639 --> 34:55.687
Shh! <i>Excusez-moi.</i>

35:00.360 --> 35:01.521
Hmm.

35:05.320 --> 35:08.369
Confirmed. It's him. It's The Frog.

35:10.280 --> 35:11.884
<i>Just don't look at him, right?</i>

35:12.080 --> 35:14.401
Well, just act natural.

35:14.600 --> 35:17.399
And whatever you do,
don't look him right in the eyes.

35:17.400 --> 35:18.811
Check.

35:20.680 --> 35:23.206
Remember,
don't look right at him.

36:02.280 --> 36:03.281
Idiot!

36:22.760 --> 36:24.649
- Marvin, you all right?
- Yeah.

36:24.760 --> 36:25.966
All right. Get her outta here.

36:26.120 --> 36:27.406
- When?
- Now!

36:28.400 --> 36:29.401
Get a car!

37:18.520 --> 37:19.601
Is that...

37:22.160 --> 37:23.161
Cut them off!

37:24.840 --> 37:26.205
This is not a good idea!

37:26.440 --> 37:27.720
She's not gonna get there first!

37:27.840 --> 37:28.887
Sidewalk!

37:37.640 --> 37:38.641
- Yes!
- No!

37:41.920 --> 37:42.921
Yes!

37:46.520 --> 37:48.522
Happy trans, bozo!

37:50.080 --> 37:52.162
Don't you think we should let...

37:52.360 --> 37:54.203
Shut your pie hole, Marvin!

38:07.040 --> 38:08.641
Don't you think we should let...

38:08.840 --> 38:09.841
Hush!

38:12.560 --> 38:13.561
Incoming!

38:18.200 --> 38:20.043
Bastard! Sidewalk!

38:23.040 --> 38:24.041
What the...

38:27.280 --> 38:28.725
She's fine.

38:30.720 --> 38:31.721
Got him.

38:48.120 --> 38:49.360
What are you doing?

38:50.240 --> 38:51.366
Got him.

38:53.280 --> 38:55.123
Look! What is she doing?

38:55.240 --> 38:56.241
I'm begging...

38:56.360 --> 38:57.486
Yeah, yeah. I got this.

39:00.200 --> 39:01.440
I so got this.

39:34.120 --> 39:36.122
I hate her so much.

39:36.280 --> 39:38.408
You're wasting your time!

39:45.760 --> 39:49.367
You're going to regret this
more than you can possibly imagine.

39:49.520 --> 39:50.851
Hey.

39:53.480 --> 39:54.481
You know who we are?

39:55.120 --> 39:56.770
Yes, of course.

39:56.960 --> 39:58.405
Tell us about Nightshade.

39:58.840 --> 40:05.479
You think I'm going to roll over for you
hegemonic Mickey Mouse-loving Americans?

40:05.480 --> 40:07.164
Leave Mickey out of it.

40:07.320 --> 40:10.279
1947 Petrus?

40:10.280 --> 40:12.089
Yes. That one's rather...

40:12.840 --> 40:13.841
God's sake!

40:13.960 --> 40:14.999
1945.

40:15.000 --> 40:16.764
Wait, wait, wait! That bottle...

40:18.840 --> 40:20.159
How do we find it?

40:20.160 --> 40:24.563
Never! Nightshade was the plot of lunatics.

40:26.000 --> 40:29.639
I used to be like you.
Driven by ideology and fear

40:29.640 --> 40:31.688
with no love of what's
beautiful in the world.

40:32.200 --> 40:34.851
I can't trust animals like you!

40:37.320 --> 40:38.685
Do what you will.

40:39.680 --> 40:40.681
Death is easy.

40:41.640 --> 40:44.530
It's not about the destination.
It's about the journey.

40:45.680 --> 40:47.603
Death is an art form in Russia.

40:48.160 --> 40:52.643
There are so many ways
to take a man to bits.

40:52.880 --> 40:55.724
Shall we start with a Chechen facelift?
Hold him down!

40:56.040 --> 40:58.359
Stop! Stop it!

40:58.360 --> 40:59.919
This is how we do it.

40:59.920 --> 41:04.323
Please. You're so brave.

41:04.720 --> 41:07.879
But you have to understand

41:07.880 --> 41:12.602
we're doing this for the right reasons.
And this...

41:15.360 --> 41:18.569
This isn't worth your life.

41:19.560 --> 41:24.248
You must have something to live for.

41:26.120 --> 41:27.360
Art.

41:29.440 --> 41:30.680
Wine.

41:33.560 --> 41:34.839
Women?

41:34.840 --> 41:35.921
Hey.

41:41.920 --> 41:43.126
Help us.

41:45.080 --> 41:46.764
We need this information.

41:48.200 --> 41:51.488
You'll be helping us save the world.
Please.

41:53.920 --> 41:55.763
Mmm.

41:59.760 --> 42:00.966
You, I'll help.

42:02.800 --> 42:04.131
Excuse me.

42:11.600 --> 42:12.681
Thank you.

42:16.120 --> 42:18.885
And you can suck it.

42:20.120 --> 42:21.679
Baby? Honey?

42:21.680 --> 42:25.127
Seriously? You hooked up with that?

42:27.640 --> 42:30.120
What a woman.

42:32.160 --> 42:33.969
Is that the same dress?

42:35.160 --> 42:36.810
They look the same to you?

42:42.760 --> 42:45.843
No one ever called me
Frank Moses' kryptonite.

42:46.640 --> 42:48.199
Frank's crazy about you.

42:48.200 --> 42:50.885
I've never seen him afraid
of anything except losing you.

42:54.800 --> 42:56.643
What if I'm ruining his life?

42:59.280 --> 43:02.489
Frank is a very simple creature
with very simple needs.

43:03.040 --> 43:04.690
Okay? It's killing,

43:05.680 --> 43:07.011
eating,

43:07.960 --> 43:09.166
sexting,

43:09.560 --> 43:10.846
eating...

43:11.720 --> 43:13.927
Killing, I guess.

43:14.640 --> 43:15.687
What's your point?

43:16.520 --> 43:19.410
I can't believe you kissed The Frog.

43:19.800 --> 43:22.326
Well, I've kissed a lotta frogs.

43:23.680 --> 43:25.679
- I got something for ya.
- What is it?

43:25.680 --> 43:28.524
The key to The Frog's security deposit box.

43:29.160 --> 43:31.367
- From?
- Credit Lyonnais.

43:37.240 --> 43:40.767
Baby, I have a request.

43:41.240 --> 43:42.765
Uh-huh.

43:43.520 --> 43:47.525
How would you feel about
going out to dinner with me tonight?

43:51.520 --> 43:53.329
- Hmm.
- It is Paris, after all.

43:53.760 --> 43:56.079
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

44:00.560 --> 44:02.608
Stay here. I'll be right back.

44:15.240 --> 44:16.571
I need you, Frank.

44:17.520 --> 44:19.090
It's not a good time.

44:19.560 --> 44:22.530
One of our old assets
has some real information.

44:23.080 --> 44:24.764
He needs to meet with us right now.

44:26.640 --> 44:27.801
Nah.

44:28.920 --> 44:31.924
Frank, what are you doing? She's kryptonite.
What are you doing?

44:32.120 --> 44:34.282
- I'll handle it.
- Are you sure?

44:37.560 --> 44:38.607
Yeah.

44:41.320 --> 44:44.279
It's not okay. It's just some work.

44:44.280 --> 44:48.126
- No, it's not fun.
- Go. You and Svetlana, you work it out.

44:48.480 --> 44:52.769
I promise you that I will be back
in time for dinner.

44:55.120 --> 44:56.121
I'll be back.

45:01.600 --> 45:02.761
Keep her safe.

45:10.800 --> 45:12.609
What happened to us, Frank?

45:12.960 --> 45:14.371
- Well...
- Hmm.

45:14.480 --> 45:16.130
You betrayed me.

45:16.240 --> 45:19.244
You set me up. Tried to kill me.

45:20.320 --> 45:21.765
I tried to kill you.

45:22.960 --> 45:25.201
They were good times, weren't they?

45:25.440 --> 45:28.799
You know, if you'd asked me
to betray my country,

45:28.800 --> 45:29.801
you know I would have.

45:33.800 --> 45:35.200
Yes, madam.

45:38.120 --> 45:39.281
My God.

45:40.640 --> 45:43.849
You know, I looked you up once.

45:45.000 --> 45:47.480
You were in a bungalow in Los Angeles.

45:48.200 --> 45:50.362
There were roses out in front.

45:51.840 --> 45:53.524
But I lost my nerve.

46:04.680 --> 46:07.843
So what do you want?

46:09.160 --> 46:12.687
It was all about work
with you, Frank. Rules.

46:13.200 --> 46:14.531
Not rules.

46:15.240 --> 46:16.526
Right and wrong.

46:17.400 --> 46:22.406
You know, it's harder for me
not to follow orders.

46:23.480 --> 46:25.767
Despite my personal feelings.

46:26.920 --> 46:29.924
But feelings don't matter
any more than right or wrong.

46:31.840 --> 46:34.047
Orders matter.

46:34.560 --> 46:35.891
Orders?

46:36.880 --> 46:38.882
Russia will handle things from here.

46:39.840 --> 46:41.569
I'm taking the key, Frank.

46:43.520 --> 46:45.204
I can't let that happen.

46:45.720 --> 46:46.846
No?

46:55.040 --> 46:59.045
I can't feel my arms.

47:04.080 --> 47:05.605
Enjoy Kansas.

47:13.960 --> 47:15.086
Hmm.

47:19.760 --> 47:20.966
He's out.

47:24.560 --> 47:26.050
He might be awake.

47:26.280 --> 47:27.770
Oh, good. So he can feel it.

47:29.080 --> 47:35.770
Did you ever, ever in your entire career
let yourself get drugged?

47:35.920 --> 47:38.764
You still like her!

47:40.080 --> 47:41.559
And now she has the key!

47:41.560 --> 47:44.609
She doesn't have the key. She has a key.

47:45.120 --> 47:46.121
What?

47:46.440 --> 47:50.126
I knew she would play him
like a banjo at an Ozark hoedown.

47:50.440 --> 47:52.283
So I have the key.

47:53.760 --> 47:54.966
Water.

48:13.800 --> 48:15.165
How long was I out for?

48:15.640 --> 48:17.165
Some of it's his.

48:17.680 --> 48:19.045
<i>Et tu</i>, Marvin?

48:19.280 --> 48:21.487
Style is the only constant in life, Frank.

48:23.320 --> 48:26.483
We didn't come to Paris on vacation.

48:27.600 --> 48:33.050
Oh. Shopping's what I thought
you did in Paris

48:33.280 --> 48:34.964
with your boyfriend's money

48:35.280 --> 48:36.850
while you're waiting for him

48:37.360 --> 48:38.959
to wake up from being taken down

48:38.960 --> 48:43.679
by his skanky, slutty,
Russian biatch ex-girlfriend.

48:43.680 --> 48:48.159
So thanks. Thanks.
Thanks for the compliment for the fur.

48:48.160 --> 48:51.999
For telling me that I look nice in my dress.
It makes me feel really good.

48:52.000 --> 48:54.685
And it makes me feel
very loving towards you also.

48:57.960 --> 48:59.639
Why is she doing this to me?

48:59.640 --> 49:01.244
We can get a taxi over here.

49:02.200 --> 49:05.079
Frank, listen, I gotta tell you something.

49:05.080 --> 49:09.722
You have to start to learn to share
your feelings to evolve your relationship.

49:09.840 --> 49:12.519
Even if it seems uncomfortable at first.

49:12.520 --> 49:15.359
Say you're pinned down in a firefight.

49:15.360 --> 49:18.967
If you stay where you are,
you're gonna die. Okay?

49:19.400 --> 49:22.039
So, you tell me, what do you do?

49:22.040 --> 49:23.359
Make the run.

49:23.360 --> 49:29.163
Yes. You have got to make the run
to emotional safety.

49:31.840 --> 49:32.841
Huh.

49:49.680 --> 49:51.559
You dead yet, Moses?

49:51.560 --> 49:52.641
Not yet.

50:00.520 --> 50:03.639
Where's my plane?

50:03.640 --> 50:04.846
In my ass!

50:08.440 --> 50:12.126
- It's in an airport outside of Paris.
- What are you... Shut up!

50:13.880 --> 50:15.291
Let's get outta here.

50:36.080 --> 50:37.525
- Marvin?
- Yeah?

50:40.640 --> 50:42.688
Is that a stick of dynamite in your pocket?

50:42.920 --> 50:46.242
Yeah, but I'm saving it for an emergency.

50:46.960 --> 50:50.442
Well, this is kind of
an emergency, isn't it?

51:18.000 --> 51:22.839
The key I gave her is connected to
a particularly nasty terrorist cell

51:22.840 --> 51:24.842
and their safe deposit box.

51:25.160 --> 51:28.164
The French take this
kinda thing pretty seriously.

51:28.680 --> 51:29.806
That's enough.

51:30.280 --> 51:32.879
Put me down! Put me down now!

51:36.640 --> 51:37.801
All right.

51:39.680 --> 51:43.526
We gotta move quickly,
Moscow will have her out within the hour.

51:45.680 --> 51:48.047
For the love of Mike.

51:51.520 --> 51:52.646
All right.

51:53.560 --> 51:55.050
I'm still not talking to you.

52:05.480 --> 52:08.802
All right. This is an MI6
report on Project Nightshade.

52:09.320 --> 52:12.210
It's about the operative
that placed the device.

52:12.560 --> 52:14.722
They took him into custody
and put him on ICE.

52:15.160 --> 52:16.399
What's ICE?

52:16.400 --> 52:22.009
Incarcerate, Cannot Execute.
Who would they keep on ICE for 32 years?

52:24.280 --> 52:26.362
- Come on. Gotta go.
- Come on where? Oh!

52:52.120 --> 52:54.521
How could she have possibly found us?

53:07.520 --> 53:10.603
'Cause I called her
and told her we were coming.

53:14.760 --> 53:17.764
I couldn't take the
pressure of not knowing.

53:26.400 --> 53:28.607
Why isn't she shooting at us?

53:50.600 --> 53:52.648
That should buy us 24 hours.

53:54.000 --> 53:55.809
Hello, sweetie.

53:56.480 --> 53:58.801
You know, the next time
you two make a plan like this,

53:58.960 --> 54:00.360
you could at least let me in on it.

54:00.760 --> 54:03.679
Frank, you're compromising me.

54:03.680 --> 54:07.366
Who knows what some girl
is gonna squeeze out of you?

54:08.840 --> 54:10.729
Where'd you get the bodies?

54:11.320 --> 54:12.651
My freezer.

54:20.800 --> 54:22.370
Come on. Wake up.

54:23.720 --> 54:24.839
Yeah?

54:24.840 --> 54:25.999
<i>What the hell's going on?</i>

54:26.000 --> 54:28.319
- Sir?
<i>- Get anything from The Frog?</i>

54:28.320 --> 54:31.847
No, he took some sorta poison
before we really talked.

54:32.680 --> 54:34.045
I don't think he's gonna say anything now.

54:34.200 --> 54:35.839
<i>You've got to find Moses and Boggs.</i>

54:35.840 --> 54:37.490
Mmm. Mmm.

54:38.160 --> 54:40.367
Don't worry. I'm on the trail.

54:45.760 --> 54:48.200
<i>On your right,
you see the famous Tower of London.</i>

54:49.040 --> 54:51.725
<i>And shortly, we'll be passing
under the Tower Bridge.</i>

54:57.280 --> 54:58.930
It's a fortress.

54:59.120 --> 55:03.879
It's an asylum for the criminally insane.
He's in the ICE unit.

55:03.880 --> 55:08.408
That's an MI6 Alpha Level secure facility
buried deep within that building.

55:09.040 --> 55:10.963
It's like a prison within a prison.

55:13.640 --> 55:15.404
How are we gonna get in there?

55:19.920 --> 55:23.759
She wants my head!
She wants my head! It's a Papist plot.

55:23.760 --> 55:27.559
It's her. It's that bitch Mary, Queen of Scots.
She wants my head.

55:27.560 --> 55:29.519
What are you doing? No! No!

55:29.520 --> 55:32.046
Get me Cecil. Get me Cecil.
I'm the Queen of England!

55:32.440 --> 55:37.199
Don't take me to the Tower!
I'll have your head for this, you bitch!

55:37.200 --> 55:39.487
No! No!

55:40.960 --> 55:45.522
"Uneasy lies the head
that wears the crown."

55:46.920 --> 55:49.605
They're plotting against me.
All of them.

55:49.800 --> 55:50.999
There's a good queen.

55:53.560 --> 55:56.086
Stuff it, you old bat.

55:56.880 --> 55:57.881
Thank you.

55:59.600 --> 56:01.841
Not so much the "old," if you don't mind.

56:11.440 --> 56:12.799
<i>I think it was
really, really good.</i>

56:12.800 --> 56:15.167
I thought I was kind of channeling
Bette Davis.

56:17.360 --> 56:20.284
Good morning. Dr. Jones to see
prisoner number 17, please.

56:20.560 --> 56:22.799
Dr. Jones? Are you with MI6?

56:22.800 --> 56:24.290
Sadly, not anymore.

56:24.400 --> 56:26.160
Because I don't seem to
have you on my list.

56:28.280 --> 56:31.329
Bloody thing's not working. Why's that?

56:33.960 --> 56:35.121
You're supposed to use...

56:35.440 --> 56:36.726
Lay down on the ground.

56:37.400 --> 56:39.323
Attaboy. On the floor.

56:41.160 --> 56:44.130
Number 121. Oh, there it is.

56:52.400 --> 56:53.606
Frank!

57:11.280 --> 57:13.439
Who are you? You're visitors?
Who are you looking for?

57:13.440 --> 57:15.120
We love having visitors, don't we, fellas?

57:16.280 --> 57:17.611
Dr. Bailey?

57:19.480 --> 57:20.606
Dr. Bailey?

57:21.040 --> 57:23.441
Yes. Who did you expect to find here? Hmm?

57:30.160 --> 57:32.003
- Sir...
- What?

57:32.320 --> 57:33.526
I saw you die.

57:34.160 --> 57:35.730
Saw me die? Who is he?

57:36.120 --> 57:37.121
Frank?

57:38.040 --> 57:40.119
Frank Moses, my dear fellow!

57:40.120 --> 57:44.039
How are you, old sport?
So glad to see you. So glad you came by.

57:44.040 --> 57:45.879
We've been expecting you.
Haven't we, fellas?

57:45.880 --> 57:48.879
My God, Frank, why are you so old?
Good lord!

57:48.880 --> 57:50.644
- Sir...
- What?

57:51.040 --> 57:53.805
You've been locked up here for 32 years.

57:54.320 --> 57:55.959
Come on, Frankie,
you've gotta be kidding me.

57:55.960 --> 57:57.719
Come on, put 'em up.

57:57.720 --> 58:00.087
Thirty-two years. How extraordinary.
Who are you?

58:00.360 --> 58:01.407
Victoria.

58:01.680 --> 58:03.409
Victoria! You should read this.

58:03.520 --> 58:07.684
Lenin. <i>State and Revolution.</i> Jolly good time.
Stalin got it wrong, of course.

58:08.160 --> 58:09.959
So where are we going, Frank?
Are you taking us

58:09.960 --> 58:11.879
to the opera again tonight?
Is that where we're going, Frank?

58:11.880 --> 58:13.359
The opera?
We love the opera, don't we, fellas?

58:13.360 --> 58:15.919
Yes, the opera and the champagne
and the strawberries all 'round.

58:15.920 --> 58:17.399
Sorry, my dear, what is your name again?

58:17.400 --> 58:18.519
Victoria.

58:18.520 --> 58:20.359
I'm sorry, it's the drugs

58:20.360 --> 58:21.759
they've been feeding me,
it's my short-term memory.

58:21.760 --> 58:22.919
The drugs they've been feeding...

58:22.920 --> 58:24.839
Something that's meant to
keep us peaceful, I suppose,

58:24.840 --> 58:26.080
or harmless!

58:26.920 --> 58:29.321
Anyway, I know
it's around here somewhere,

58:29.440 --> 58:31.807
but I don't know where it is.

58:32.240 --> 58:34.599
Dr. Bailey, we need your help.

58:34.600 --> 58:37.251
- Mmm?
- Do you remember Nightshade?

58:37.440 --> 58:42.002
I'm sorry, I'm looking for my pipe
and my St. Christopher medallion.

58:42.120 --> 58:43.929
Boys gave it to someone.

58:44.040 --> 58:45.371
They were little boys, you see.

58:45.560 --> 58:47.200
Now where it's gone... It's gone somehow.

58:54.440 --> 58:55.885
Um...

58:58.720 --> 59:01.039
Oh, shit!

59:02.120 --> 59:03.560
Hey, Frankie, I'm over here.

59:03.720 --> 59:05.279
I found it. it was in my
pocket the whole time.

59:05.280 --> 59:07.799
I couldn't find my damn pipe, though.
But here it is.

59:07.800 --> 59:10.280
Sorry, my dear,
what was the question you asked me?

59:10.880 --> 59:12.644
Do you remember Nightshade?

59:12.920 --> 59:14.959
Vaguely. It was some kind of
a bomb, I believe.

59:14.960 --> 59:17.479
Dr. Bailey, people are looking
for that weapon.

59:17.480 --> 59:19.119
People who want to use it.

59:19.120 --> 59:22.044
Oh, dear. Yes, I do understand, of course.
Believe you me.

59:22.160 --> 59:25.319
But you know, I made many things
for the Americans and

59:25.320 --> 59:27.319
Nightshade turned out to be
a bit of a nightmare.

59:27.320 --> 59:30.479
It was quite different.
Turned out to be too dangerous.

59:30.480 --> 59:32.319
So naturally, they had to lock me up
in this place.

59:32.320 --> 59:34.279
And after what they did to me,
I think it's perfectly natural

59:34.280 --> 59:35.441
I tell them all to go F off!

59:38.920 --> 59:42.839
MI6 tried to fake Bailey's death?
Why? What are they hiding?

59:42.840 --> 59:45.161
You're gonna have to go.
You're gonna have to go find out.

59:47.800 --> 59:49.720
You know
they're gonna try and kill me.

59:49.840 --> 59:51.920
- I'll call you from Russia.
<i>- Do svidanya.</i>

59:52.320 --> 59:54.163
<i>Maintenance to Bridge 7.</i>

59:54.800 --> 59:56.450
We got a breach in Maximum Security.

01:00:05.520 --> 01:00:06.521
Secure!

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:14.519
All right, what's so important?

01:00:14.520 --> 01:00:18.286
I just heard from my source at MI6
that Edward Bailey's alive and on the run.

01:00:18.480 --> 01:00:20.839
- That's not possible.
- This is bigger than a rogue general

01:00:20.840 --> 01:00:22.968
and his unexploded ordnance.
What don't I know?

01:00:23.200 --> 01:00:24.850
The game has changed.

01:00:25.040 --> 01:00:27.327
The things Bailey knows are too dangerous.

01:00:27.840 --> 01:00:31.890
We can't let Bailey or Nightshade fall into
terrorist hands, or millions will die.

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:34.286
Holy shit, it's real.

01:00:34.720 --> 01:00:37.644
Unless we secure it, that weapon's
going off in the middle of Moscow.

01:00:38.040 --> 01:00:40.407
Right now, that's our best case scenario.

01:01:13.520 --> 01:01:14.601
Guys?

01:01:33.280 --> 01:01:34.439
Ah!

01:01:34.440 --> 01:01:36.920
Welcome, my friends.

01:01:39.760 --> 01:01:44.288
So, it is true. You're alive.

01:01:44.600 --> 01:01:48.810
Tell me, then, where is this device?

01:01:49.520 --> 01:01:50.646
Who?

01:01:54.760 --> 01:01:56.489
Work in progress.

01:01:58.880 --> 01:02:01.201
<i>I never thought I'd be smuggling</i>

01:02:01.320 --> 01:02:05.041
Frank Moses into the
heart of Mother Russia.

01:02:05.480 --> 01:02:06.561
Me, neither.

01:02:06.760 --> 01:02:10.242
Oh, before I forget. Frank.
Frank, a little something.

01:02:10.640 --> 01:02:14.565
If you are caught or Han catches you

01:02:14.960 --> 01:02:19.807
suicide pill is a much better option
than what you face.

01:02:21.800 --> 01:02:26.169
You die with Russian smile on.

01:02:27.960 --> 01:02:29.166
Good luck. <i>Do svidanya.</i>

01:02:31.480 --> 01:02:33.323
- Mr. Bailey.
- Yes, Frank?

01:02:33.680 --> 01:02:38.163
Is there any way you could tell us
where you hid the nuclear weapon?

01:02:38.680 --> 01:02:42.366
Look at all those cows, Frank.
They're beautiful.

01:02:43.480 --> 01:02:44.527
Yeah.

01:02:46.960 --> 01:02:48.007
Cows?

01:02:54.320 --> 01:02:57.847
Hi! Yoo hoo!

01:03:00.440 --> 01:03:02.010
That's not good.

01:03:16.200 --> 01:03:17.804
We have eyes on, Frank.

01:03:39.040 --> 01:03:40.246
Where's my plane?

01:03:43.400 --> 01:03:45.164
They paid me to kill you.

01:03:45.640 --> 01:03:48.211
They didn't say I had to do it all at once.

01:04:06.560 --> 01:04:07.720
This is not over, Moses.

01:04:09.600 --> 01:04:11.921
We're not over! It's not!

01:04:20.440 --> 01:04:22.044
What's wrong with him?

01:05:21.160 --> 01:05:22.161
Wow.

01:05:22.800 --> 01:05:24.609
What is this place?

01:05:24.840 --> 01:05:26.604
My first safe house.

01:05:28.160 --> 01:05:32.484
Untouched, since 1984. Aw!

01:05:39.680 --> 01:05:40.966
Fugu poison?

01:05:41.200 --> 01:05:44.761
Fugu poison is deadly stuff.
Terrible death.

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:48.846
This your little gizmo? XKG gas.
I invented it.

01:05:49.680 --> 01:05:52.604
We tried to take out
old Fidel Castro in '61 in Cuba.

01:05:52.840 --> 01:05:54.046
That didn't work though.

01:05:54.640 --> 01:05:55.721
Any tea, Frank?

01:05:55.880 --> 01:05:58.087
Why does Han hate you so much?

01:05:58.680 --> 01:06:00.444
Not enough hugs as a child.

01:06:02.360 --> 01:06:06.888
Frank framed him for
stealing state secrets.

01:06:07.120 --> 01:06:11.887
So he went from being
a highly decorated counter-intel officer

01:06:12.040 --> 01:06:15.010
to... to being a pariah.

01:06:15.480 --> 01:06:20.399
What's ironic though, is that Frank
actually created the circumstances

01:06:20.400 --> 01:06:21.890
for his own death.

01:06:22.160 --> 01:06:23.207
It's poetic.

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:25.240
I ain't dead yet.

01:06:34.080 --> 01:06:37.209
Should you eat that?

01:06:37.560 --> 01:06:39.369
Is that safe?

01:06:40.160 --> 01:06:44.563
It's before they had that,
you know, "sell by" date stuff.

01:06:44.680 --> 01:06:45.761
Oh.

01:06:47.520 --> 01:06:49.170
So did you get to meet Castro?

01:06:50.200 --> 01:06:51.201
Who?

01:06:51.440 --> 01:06:52.885
Did you get to meet Castro?

01:06:53.080 --> 01:06:55.919
Yes, I did, actually. About two weeks
after Kennedy was assassinated.

01:06:55.920 --> 01:06:57.285
Talking of which, Frank,

01:06:58.200 --> 01:07:00.679
I'm starting to remember
more and more who I am

01:07:00.680 --> 01:07:02.284
and who I was and the weapons I made.

01:07:02.520 --> 01:07:04.682
My God, it really is amazing.

01:07:04.880 --> 01:07:07.963
How efficiently those boys from MI6,
may God bless 'em...

01:07:08.360 --> 01:07:09.439
But you know something, Frank?

01:07:09.440 --> 01:07:11.519
They really do throw us away.
Don't they, old sport?

01:07:11.520 --> 01:07:14.239
When we're no longer convenient, I suppose.

01:07:14.240 --> 01:07:16.600
As though we'd never given them
the best years of our lives.

01:07:16.880 --> 01:07:18.211
Bit of a joke, really.

01:07:19.280 --> 01:07:21.089
Yes, very strange.

01:07:22.800 --> 01:07:24.768
Do you remember where Nightshade is?

01:07:26.280 --> 01:07:27.281
I'm sorry, my dear?

01:07:27.720 --> 01:07:29.643
Do you remember where Nightshade is?

01:07:30.640 --> 01:07:31.801
Oh, yes.

01:07:33.720 --> 01:07:35.051
Now, this feels right.

01:07:38.320 --> 01:07:41.403
It's around here somewhere.
I'm sure this time.

01:07:41.800 --> 01:07:43.723
Everything looks different completely.

01:07:44.480 --> 01:07:45.811
Maybe it's over here.

01:07:45.960 --> 01:07:48.327
- It's been hours. Hours.
- Yeah, this is it.

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:50.081
Here we are.

01:07:50.800 --> 01:07:52.802
How are those Jimmy Choos
working out for you?

01:07:54.160 --> 01:07:55.400
The entrance is up there.

01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:58.331
Who's Papa John?

01:07:58.560 --> 01:07:59.639
It's new.

01:07:59.640 --> 01:08:00.801
Entrance to what?

01:08:01.600 --> 01:08:03.762
Secret tunnels
through the old catacombs.

01:08:03.960 --> 01:08:05.689
Brezhnev used it to sneak his mistress in.

01:08:05.920 --> 01:08:07.400
- In where?
- In there.

01:08:09.320 --> 01:08:10.446
The Kremlin?

01:08:11.440 --> 01:08:13.010
The weapon is in the Kremlin?

01:08:13.320 --> 01:08:14.970
It's the one place they wouldn't look.

01:08:33.120 --> 01:08:35.202
Jesus. Do you mind keeping it warm?

01:08:50.880 --> 01:08:53.850
You have no idea
the damage you've done.

01:08:54.040 --> 01:08:57.559
You kept one of our own
locked up for 32 years.

01:08:57.560 --> 01:08:58.919
I have kept the world safe.

01:08:58.920 --> 01:09:01.526
- If that weapon falls into the wrong hands...
- The weapon?

01:09:02.359 --> 01:09:06.729
You haven't the slightest idea.

01:09:13.080 --> 01:09:14.479
You must let me call Moses.

01:09:14.479 --> 01:09:16.403
He doesn't know what he's walking into.

01:09:16.800 --> 01:09:19.883
You've had your chance. It's over.

01:09:21.560 --> 01:09:23.368
I'm sorry, Victoria.

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:31.923
Sorry, my ass.

01:09:33.720 --> 01:09:35.448
They say you're a legend around here.

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:37.046
I've...

01:09:38.399 --> 01:09:39.765
I've never heard of you.

01:09:40.760 --> 01:09:43.764
Must have been a bit before my time.

01:09:49.920 --> 01:09:51.604
Well, you've heard of me now.

01:09:54.760 --> 01:09:58.890
How is it possible they never picked up
the radiation signature from that bomb?

01:09:59.080 --> 01:10:01.447
That's the million dollar question.

01:10:02.960 --> 01:10:04.962
Hey, gang. This is new.

01:10:06.120 --> 01:10:07.929
What do you think is behind that wall?

01:10:09.080 --> 01:10:10.241
Um...

01:10:10.760 --> 01:10:12.046
I think Russians.

01:10:36.480 --> 01:10:39.006
If anybody sees that hole, we're dead.

01:10:39.240 --> 01:10:40.924
I'm gonna need you to help me
to disarm the weapon.

01:10:41.240 --> 01:10:43.319
Frank, somebody's gotta guard the door.

01:10:44.480 --> 01:10:45.970
- No.
- But...

01:10:48.240 --> 01:10:49.446
You'll need this.

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:04.126
One more time.

01:11:09.680 --> 01:11:11.199
Great. Great. What does that mean?

01:11:11.200 --> 01:11:13.639
"Gas leak. Maintenance is coming."

01:11:13.640 --> 01:11:16.240
- Good. And then they'll move on.
- And what if they don't?

01:11:16.520 --> 01:11:17.679
- Want a gun?
- Yes.

01:11:17.680 --> 01:11:18.966
No. No gun.

01:11:19.680 --> 01:11:23.002
Just don't move. You're a security guard.

01:11:23.520 --> 01:11:25.679
Don't smile. You can't smile.

01:11:28.880 --> 01:11:31.201
You just never leave your post. Okay?

01:11:32.520 --> 01:11:33.646
Nice.

01:11:47.400 --> 01:11:48.970
Two shots, here and here.

01:11:49.200 --> 01:11:51.521
Drag the body in there
and repeat as necessary.

01:11:51.720 --> 01:11:54.087
- No safety.
- No safety.

01:12:09.160 --> 01:12:12.243
Frank, I don't like
the Kremlin so much.

01:12:12.840 --> 01:12:17.368
And I like being underneath it even less.

01:12:30.520 --> 01:12:31.760
Here we are.

01:12:33.920 --> 01:12:36.924
That's great. It's just like yesterday.

01:12:38.920 --> 01:12:41.366
There's my wrench or crow bar.
Look at this.

01:12:42.600 --> 01:12:43.601
There.

01:12:44.520 --> 01:12:45.885
Hey, look, chaps.

01:12:46.360 --> 01:12:48.519
That's my old pipe.
I knew I'd left it somewhere.

01:12:48.520 --> 01:12:50.602
My dear wife bought this the fifth, 1969.

01:12:50.720 --> 01:12:53.451
It was our wedding anniversary.
Oh, yes! This is, um...

01:12:54.720 --> 01:12:57.451
This is Nightshade, by the way.

01:13:03.280 --> 01:13:04.406
There.

01:13:05.880 --> 01:13:07.803
- Is that...
- That's Red Mercury.

01:13:09.120 --> 01:13:10.485
Red Mercury?

01:13:10.800 --> 01:13:12.768
We were always told it was a Cold War myth.

01:13:13.440 --> 01:13:15.879
Yes, they said it couldn't be done,
but I did it. See?

01:13:15.880 --> 01:13:18.963
Frank, if that's Red Mercury,
you can zip it up in a backpack

01:13:19.120 --> 01:13:21.407
and take it on the White House tour.
It's undetectable.

01:13:22.160 --> 01:13:25.159
No signature. No fallout.

01:13:25.160 --> 01:13:27.479
This is a weapon
that will entirely change

01:13:27.480 --> 01:13:30.962
the balance of international power overnight.
Just like that.

01:13:31.840 --> 01:13:33.410
We're all gonna die.

01:13:34.080 --> 01:13:35.161
On your knees.

01:13:38.600 --> 01:13:39.647
Katja.

01:13:40.680 --> 01:13:42.842
No government should have this weapon.

01:13:43.320 --> 01:13:45.846
Not yours. And not mine.

01:13:46.640 --> 01:13:48.165
I have orders.

01:13:49.320 --> 01:13:52.085
This isn't about orders.
This is about right and wrong.

01:13:52.960 --> 01:13:54.086
Don't.

01:13:56.200 --> 01:13:58.441
Did you really come to
see me in the States?

01:13:58.960 --> 01:14:00.166
Yes.

01:14:01.360 --> 01:14:03.806
What color were the flowers
outside my house?

01:14:11.680 --> 01:14:13.045
Yellow.

01:15:10.680 --> 01:15:13.331
What in the name of... Hey!

01:15:15.640 --> 01:15:17.559
What are you doing kissing this guy?

01:15:17.560 --> 01:15:18.879
I didn't wanna kill him.

01:15:18.880 --> 01:15:21.399
What kinda stupid logic is that?

01:15:21.400 --> 01:15:22.970
What in the Sam Hill is she doing here?

01:15:23.080 --> 01:15:25.159
She's working with us again.

01:15:25.160 --> 01:15:26.439
Like heck she is.

01:15:26.440 --> 01:15:27.599
Why were you kissing that guy?

01:15:27.600 --> 01:15:31.491
Kids, what happens
in the Kremlin stays in the Kremlin.

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:36.844
You are gonna
have to explain this to me.

01:15:59.960 --> 01:16:01.041
Hey, Comrades!

01:16:01.560 --> 01:16:02.686
Here's to more success.

01:16:03.040 --> 01:16:04.159
Success.

01:16:04.160 --> 01:16:05.321
And saving the world!

01:16:05.720 --> 01:16:06.801
Saving the world!

01:16:07.360 --> 01:16:08.639
<i>Na zdorovie!</i>

01:16:08.640 --> 01:16:09.641
<i>Na zdorovie!</i>

01:16:16.560 --> 01:16:19.040
I got this. Right back.

01:16:19.480 --> 01:16:20.481
Hey.

01:16:20.840 --> 01:16:21.919
Where are you?

01:16:21.920 --> 01:16:22.921
Moscow.

01:16:23.520 --> 01:16:25.249
He's a nutter, Francis.

01:16:25.440 --> 01:16:27.919
MI6 didn't lock him up
because he created the weapon

01:16:27.920 --> 01:16:29.729
but because he wants to see it go off.

01:16:35.400 --> 01:16:36.606
Hello, Frank.

01:16:37.640 --> 01:16:39.642
That was Victoria, wasn't it?

01:16:40.120 --> 01:16:42.839
Telling you that I was
some sort of a monster

01:16:42.840 --> 01:16:46.401
who once wanted to destroy
the Soviet empire.

01:16:46.880 --> 01:16:50.089
Yeah. Very slowly.

01:16:52.240 --> 01:16:53.924
That's it. Good boy.

01:16:59.840 --> 01:17:01.842
Good. In you go.

01:17:03.200 --> 01:17:04.247
Marvin...

01:17:05.200 --> 01:17:06.531
Guns down.

01:17:14.920 --> 01:17:17.161
Weapons down. Very slowly.

01:17:19.480 --> 01:17:21.847
You planted the thing on WikiLeaks.

01:17:22.040 --> 01:17:25.203
Oh, yes, it was a cell phone
taken from a guard.

01:17:25.720 --> 01:17:28.963
I was just itching to get
my revenge on MI6, you see.

01:17:29.200 --> 01:17:32.124
Frank, you were absolutely marvelous
the way you found The Frog.

01:17:32.400 --> 01:17:33.811
No one else could have found him.

01:17:34.040 --> 01:17:35.121
Jack?

01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:40.163
Sorry, Frank, I made a deal already
with Mr. Horton for Red Mercury.

01:17:40.840 --> 01:17:42.330
- Well done, Bailey.
- Thanks.

01:17:43.400 --> 01:17:45.482
Nice to see you again, Frank.
Pick up the guns.

01:17:46.760 --> 01:17:49.366
Your country appreciates
your sacrifice, Frank.

01:17:51.120 --> 01:17:52.565
But your time's up.

01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:55.047
Let's go.

01:17:56.920 --> 01:17:58.046
It's time, Bailey.

01:17:58.400 --> 01:17:59.481
Yes, it is time.

01:18:02.080 --> 01:18:03.159
Very Interesting.

01:18:03.160 --> 01:18:09.122
Rogue American agents turned nuclear
terrorists kill top Russian officer.

01:18:09.840 --> 01:18:10.887
Not good.

01:18:11.720 --> 01:18:13.529
So long, Frank. So long, Marvin.

01:18:15.240 --> 01:18:16.571
Come on, boys, let's go.

01:18:22.280 --> 01:18:24.442
Easy. Easy.

01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:00.480
Oh, please, let me take that from you.

01:19:00.880 --> 01:19:03.201
I thought we were doing
the debriefing in London.

01:19:03.400 --> 01:19:06.479
Oh, we were. But since
you're such a sick, twisted bastard,

01:19:06.480 --> 01:19:07.481
you're going to Colorado.

01:19:07.760 --> 01:19:11.119
There's a secret facility there,
it's about a mile underground,

01:19:11.120 --> 01:19:14.039
where you will spend your remaining years
having every bit of knowledge

01:19:14.040 --> 01:19:16.119
plucked from that giant head of yours.

01:19:16.120 --> 01:19:17.121
Really?
Hmm.

01:19:17.640 --> 01:19:19.119
And since we're speaking frankly,

01:19:19.120 --> 01:19:21.282
I should say that it will
make your last 32 years

01:19:21.400 --> 01:19:23.528
seem like a vacation in the Caribbean.

01:19:24.760 --> 01:19:25.761
Cuff him.

01:19:26.360 --> 01:19:27.441
Mmm.

01:19:28.480 --> 01:19:29.641
Oh, I say.

01:19:30.920 --> 01:19:31.967
Well, well.

01:19:35.320 --> 01:19:37.240
Bet you didn't see that coming.
Did you, old man?

01:19:37.440 --> 01:19:40.011
I must say, I didn't. Jolly good.

01:19:40.200 --> 01:19:41.201
After you.

01:19:41.560 --> 01:19:43.528
Thank you.
Good morning, gentlemen.

01:20:05.200 --> 01:20:06.326
What did he say?

01:20:06.520 --> 01:20:07.601
Ready.

01:20:08.360 --> 01:20:09.771
Do something. Do something.

01:20:09.960 --> 01:20:10.961
I love you.

01:20:11.200 --> 01:20:13.123
At least Han didn't get us first.

01:20:13.400 --> 01:20:15.368
Really? You're gonna
bring that up right now?

01:20:31.400 --> 01:20:35.530
Ah, there is nothing more sexy
in the whole world

01:20:36.400 --> 01:20:40.769
than a beautiful woman
with an incredible gun.

01:20:41.960 --> 01:20:43.450
You're such a romantic.

01:20:50.480 --> 01:20:51.606
Watch your eyes.

01:20:53.800 --> 01:20:55.080
Close your eyes.

01:20:56.680 --> 01:21:01.083
I love the way your toes curl
right before you fire.

01:21:01.640 --> 01:21:03.119
Hopeless.

01:21:03.120 --> 01:21:04.639
Mmm.

01:21:04.640 --> 01:21:05.641
Ah!

01:21:47.720 --> 01:21:49.324
- Freeze.
- Shh!

01:21:52.440 --> 01:21:55.683
You know something? I don't think you
ought to point that idiotic thing at me.

01:21:55.880 --> 01:21:59.441
You should really start thinking about
your security protocol, don't you think?

01:22:01.320 --> 01:22:02.401
What the hell is that?

01:22:02.520 --> 01:22:04.170
That, my dear boy, is an antidote

01:22:04.360 --> 01:22:08.843
to the most powerful nerve
agent ever created. Look.

01:22:18.280 --> 01:22:19.566
Hello, boys.

01:22:36.320 --> 01:22:37.685
Hello, Mr. Davis.

01:22:42.880 --> 01:22:44.679
And you didn't see that coming.

01:22:44.680 --> 01:22:46.125
Did you, old sport?

01:22:46.720 --> 01:22:49.200
I'm sure you wouldn't want
to miss what's coming next.

01:22:49.880 --> 01:22:52.451
It's a little antidote. Jolly good.

01:22:53.080 --> 01:22:54.206
That's right.

01:22:54.360 --> 01:22:55.839
Uh, uh, uh, uh.

01:22:55.840 --> 01:22:58.047
Good. Thank you.

01:22:59.760 --> 01:23:00.807
Jolly good.

01:23:01.920 --> 01:23:04.599
Honestly, two days,
Frank, two days,

01:23:04.600 --> 01:23:06.199
and you're in front of a firing squad?

01:23:06.200 --> 01:23:07.279
Yeah. But look...

01:23:07.280 --> 01:23:09.806
No. No excuses.
You're better than this. It's pathetic.

01:23:09.920 --> 01:23:13.925
Frank, an American military transport
made an emergency landing in London.

01:23:14.400 --> 01:23:16.767
Everyone aboard was found dead.

01:23:17.280 --> 01:23:20.489
Bailey has taken refuge
in the Iranian embassy.

01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:22.684
The Iranian embassy?

01:23:22.880 --> 01:23:24.086
We've gotta go there.

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:27.048
All right. Get 'em ready.

01:23:27.560 --> 01:23:29.847
I'm gonna make sure we're
cleared for takeoff.

01:23:30.520 --> 01:23:32.648
If the world is here in a week,

01:23:33.760 --> 01:23:35.919
I will meet you in the Turks and Caicos.

01:23:35.920 --> 01:23:37.079
Mmm-hmm.

01:23:37.080 --> 01:23:39.839
And we will spend all night

01:23:39.840 --> 01:23:41.763
- beneath the stars.
- Beneath the stars.

01:23:43.120 --> 01:23:44.281
Mmm...

01:24:21.960 --> 01:24:23.405
I don't speak Korean!

01:24:32.680 --> 01:24:33.920
You having fun yet?

01:24:34.120 --> 01:24:36.248
I'll let you know when I start having fun.

01:24:40.040 --> 01:24:41.280
You betrayed me.

01:24:41.680 --> 01:24:42.761
I had no choice.

01:24:49.400 --> 01:24:52.290
You'd have done the same thing,
if you were me.

01:24:57.760 --> 01:24:59.364
How much is the US paying you?

01:24:59.600 --> 01:25:00.679
20 million.

01:25:00.680 --> 01:25:01.841
Are you kiddin' me?

01:25:04.480 --> 01:25:05.527
I asked for more.

01:25:08.800 --> 01:25:10.006
What happened to you?

01:25:10.360 --> 01:25:11.771
You used to be a good agent.

01:25:24.160 --> 01:25:26.766
Stop! Wait a minute.
Listen, I need your help.

01:25:27.800 --> 01:25:30.724
I know there's a part of you
that wants to do the right thing.

01:25:30.920 --> 01:25:32.721
There is a weapon
that's gonna be detonated...

01:25:35.840 --> 01:25:37.080
Bullshit.

01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:40.525
It's not bullshit.

01:25:43.440 --> 01:25:45.442
There's a bomb headed for London right now.

01:25:46.320 --> 01:25:49.642
Eleven million people are gonna
lose their lives if you don't help me.

01:26:25.400 --> 01:26:26.561
All right.

01:26:28.840 --> 01:26:30.171
Let's go.

01:26:35.720 --> 01:26:38.769
This doesn't mean I'm not
going to kill you later.

01:26:39.480 --> 01:26:40.527
I know.

01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:44.080
I think the way
to make a relationship work

01:26:44.200 --> 01:26:48.000
is that neither of you give up who you are.
Don't you agree, Marvin?

01:26:58.480 --> 01:27:01.086
Exactly. Exactly what Marvin says.

01:27:01.280 --> 01:27:06.286
Falling in love is like jumping off a cliff.
You just have to believe and let go.

01:27:09.760 --> 01:27:11.250
My God!

01:27:12.920 --> 01:27:14.285
Are you okay?

01:27:16.400 --> 01:27:17.447
No, he's all right.

01:27:17.800 --> 01:27:18.847
He's with us.

01:27:22.760 --> 01:27:24.125
We talked it out.

01:27:39.720 --> 01:27:42.919
Kill Bailey. Secure the weapon.

01:27:42.920 --> 01:27:43.921
How hard can it be?

01:27:46.640 --> 01:27:49.439
Of course, the external security
is very, very heavy

01:27:49.440 --> 01:27:52.479
but inside there are hardcore
Revolutionary Guards.

01:27:52.480 --> 01:27:54.369
They are serious fanatics.

01:27:56.560 --> 01:27:58.210
The whole thing depends on her.

01:27:59.640 --> 01:28:03.361
You do realize, if they catch you,
they will kill you.

01:28:10.680 --> 01:28:12.680
<i>I know this won't be
easy for you, but don't worry.</i>

01:28:12.800 --> 01:28:13.801
Okay?

01:28:20.720 --> 01:28:23.883
You know, I've been thinking about

01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:28.049
you and me.

01:28:28.880 --> 01:28:30.962
And I just...

01:28:36.160 --> 01:28:37.491
I got you something.

01:28:55.160 --> 01:28:56.366
Wow.

01:28:56.600 --> 01:28:57.726
You like it?

01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:00.002
- I love it.
- Seven rounds.

01:29:06.360 --> 01:29:08.119
- Okay.
- Not yet. I'm not ready.

01:29:08.120 --> 01:29:10.439
Stop, no.
Not right now. Wait.

01:29:10.440 --> 01:29:11.879
If you don't do it,
you're gonna blow it, all right?

01:29:11.880 --> 01:29:12.959
Look at me.

01:29:12.960 --> 01:29:14.279
- I'm gonna count to three.
- Mmm. Listen...

01:29:14.280 --> 01:29:15.439
I'm gonna count to three, okay?

01:29:15.440 --> 01:29:17.001
- We can go back to the...
- In English.

01:29:17.240 --> 01:29:19.527
- One...
- Not now. No. Wait.

01:29:19.720 --> 01:29:21.210
Two...

01:29:23.160 --> 01:29:24.730
God damn it.

01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:27.047
Hi.

01:29:39.040 --> 01:29:40.530
She's gonna get killed.

01:29:41.280 --> 01:29:43.886
It's tough when they leave the nest.

01:29:44.240 --> 01:29:46.322
Frank, come on. A little trust.

01:29:46.440 --> 01:29:48.727
She has talents you and I will never have.

01:29:49.400 --> 01:29:50.640
What talents?

01:29:51.160 --> 01:29:52.525
People like her.

01:29:53.680 --> 01:29:57.844
If she lives,
this'll be good for your relationship.

01:29:58.240 --> 01:29:59.321
You're right.

01:29:59.720 --> 01:30:03.327
And if there's one thing I know,
it's women and covert ops.

01:30:04.040 --> 01:30:05.485
That's two things.

01:30:08.080 --> 01:30:10.048
No, grasshopper.

01:30:11.320 --> 01:30:12.651
It is not.

01:30:13.280 --> 01:30:17.001
I wanna tell you a secret, Mr. Minister.

01:30:22.760 --> 01:30:25.525
Is she gonna make out with this guy, too?

01:30:28.880 --> 01:30:29.961
Ohh!

01:30:30.560 --> 01:30:31.721
What the hell was that?

01:30:32.040 --> 01:30:33.326
Blowfish poison.

01:30:33.920 --> 01:30:37.242
Paralysis and shooting pains
will grip your entire body.

01:30:37.840 --> 01:30:40.002
And you will slowly asphyxiate
until you choke to death

01:30:40.120 --> 01:30:43.567
while remaining fully-conscious,
unless you do exactly what I say.

01:30:51.720 --> 01:30:54.371
I will die before I compromise my country.

01:30:56.280 --> 01:31:00.399
Okay. We will drive you to your office where
you will write a letter on official stationery

01:31:00.400 --> 01:31:02.919
denouncing the treatment of women in Iran.

01:31:02.920 --> 01:31:04.410
Then you will get your antidote.

01:31:05.280 --> 01:31:06.566
That's it?

01:31:17.080 --> 01:31:18.127
How may I help you?

01:31:37.080 --> 01:31:40.641
Ah. Dr. Bailey, my apologies for the delay.

01:31:41.240 --> 01:31:44.279
Professor Dombrovski has
declared the weapon authentic.

01:31:44.280 --> 01:31:45.884
And we're prepared to proceed.

01:31:46.320 --> 01:31:49.244
As soon as my money's transferred,
Mr. Ambassador.

01:31:54.560 --> 01:31:56.927
Move! She's with me.

01:32:17.920 --> 01:32:18.921
Arman?

01:32:25.280 --> 01:32:26.399
He needs to go.

01:32:26.400 --> 01:32:27.719
Okay, okay.

01:32:28.920 --> 01:32:30.604
What are you talking about? Who is she?

01:32:30.800 --> 01:32:32.723
Sir, I'm sorry, you need to leave.

01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:34.604
You need to shut up!

01:32:35.160 --> 01:32:36.239
No.

01:32:36.240 --> 01:32:38.119
What? What is happening here?

01:32:38.120 --> 01:32:39.167
Sorry. What are you doing?

01:32:39.280 --> 01:32:41.399
Tell me what is happening here! Who is she?

01:32:41.400 --> 01:32:44.199
Get out! When I say "get
out," get out of here!

01:32:44.200 --> 01:32:45.486
You need to go!

01:32:45.680 --> 01:32:47.091
You shut the fuck up!

01:32:56.600 --> 01:32:58.011
Where's the safe?

01:32:58.240 --> 01:32:59.287
What?

01:33:00.240 --> 01:33:01.810
Where's the safe?

01:33:13.480 --> 01:33:15.926
Poo poo's coming.

01:33:34.480 --> 01:33:35.925
24 Hour Plumbing.

01:33:36.120 --> 01:33:38.726
<i>Hurry. Emergency.
Water everywhere. Come quick.</i>

01:33:52.760 --> 01:33:54.762
Stop! Plumbers, wait!

01:33:54.960 --> 01:33:56.883
It's okay! This way.

01:33:58.400 --> 01:33:59.526
Money received.

01:34:00.040 --> 01:34:01.166
Good show.

01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:03.604
Let's see our friend here.

01:34:08.320 --> 01:34:09.924
Would you lend me your knife, please?

01:34:10.720 --> 01:34:11.801
Thank you.

01:34:13.880 --> 01:34:15.564
Sorry about the mess on the carpet.

01:34:18.160 --> 01:34:19.207
Oh, Well.

01:34:19.640 --> 01:34:22.559
At this point, Jack... You don't
mind me calling you "Jack," I hope.

01:34:22.560 --> 01:34:25.609
You must be beginning to comprehend

01:34:25.720 --> 01:34:28.485
the stunning totality of your failure.

01:34:30.760 --> 01:34:31.966
You can't give it to them.

01:34:32.360 --> 01:34:34.679
Oh, I've no more interest
in giving Red Mercury

01:34:34.680 --> 01:34:37.524
to these boys than I have
in giving it to you.

01:34:44.160 --> 01:34:45.241
Jesus.

01:34:45.360 --> 01:34:47.639
Yes, it's a sad old world, you know.

01:34:47.640 --> 01:34:49.290
Anyway, that's only my opinion.

01:34:49.480 --> 01:34:52.165
But the central point is this, Jack,

01:34:52.520 --> 01:34:56.639
you see, when men like you
and those dickheads from MI6

01:34:56.640 --> 01:34:59.007
or CIA or whatever sewers you came from.

01:34:59.200 --> 01:35:01.851
When you take away not only my life

01:35:02.400 --> 01:35:05.999
but the innocent lives of
my dear beloved wife Natasha

01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:08.919
and my little boy,
who was only six, you see. Yes.

01:35:08.920 --> 01:35:10.206
I mean, what can I say?

01:35:11.800 --> 01:35:14.280
When you mess with me, buddy,

01:35:14.720 --> 01:35:15.881
this is what you get.

01:35:16.480 --> 01:35:17.606
Go to hell, old man.

01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:25.923
Fare thee well, patriot.

01:35:31.800 --> 01:35:32.881
Boom.

01:35:34.640 --> 01:35:35.880
Now what's next?

01:35:36.680 --> 01:35:37.727
Ah, Washington.

01:35:50.720 --> 01:35:52.879
Baby, hey.

01:35:52.880 --> 01:35:54.006
Are you okay?

01:35:56.200 --> 01:35:57.326
Hah!

01:35:57.720 --> 01:35:58.721
Awesome!

01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:17.922
Oh, shit.

01:36:18.040 --> 01:36:20.646
- Is that it?
- It's counting down, Frank.

01:36:20.840 --> 01:36:21.841
Shut it Off. Right?

01:36:22.080 --> 01:36:25.559
Shut... Yeah.
With what? Acupressure?

01:36:25.560 --> 01:36:28.882
- I don't know.
- Well, why is it my responsibility?

01:36:30.040 --> 01:36:31.041
Just do something.

01:36:31.400 --> 01:36:33.880
With my Mr. Chemistry set?

01:36:35.080 --> 01:36:38.209
I don't know what I'm doing.
You want me to push a button?

01:36:38.960 --> 01:36:40.530
Bailey's loose and the bomb's ticking.

01:36:45.400 --> 01:36:46.890
Wait. Excuse me, ma'am.

01:36:47.080 --> 01:36:48.570
Hello, I have an appointment.

01:36:51.880 --> 01:36:53.769
Gun!

01:37:18.960 --> 01:37:20.200
Get that bomb outta here.

01:37:25.920 --> 01:37:28.241
- Drop it now, darling. That's right.
- My gun!

01:37:35.280 --> 01:37:36.520
Press the button. Ground floor.

01:37:37.480 --> 01:37:39.289
Marvin, let's go!

01:37:44.800 --> 01:37:46.086
Jolly good show.

01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:54.081
Bollocks.

01:37:59.480 --> 01:38:01.801
You really drive this ridiculous thing?

01:38:02.240 --> 01:38:03.526
Can you shoot?

01:38:09.840 --> 01:38:11.490
We need eyes, Francis.

01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:26.809
Come on, Frank. Forty minutes.

01:38:36.160 --> 01:38:37.440
Marvin, how ya doin' back there?

01:38:37.640 --> 01:38:39.449
I can't talk to you right now.

01:38:42.680 --> 01:38:43.806
How is it?

01:38:44.040 --> 01:38:45.121
It's fine.

01:38:48.680 --> 01:38:49.727
Shit!

01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:55.161
Show me something.

01:39:21.360 --> 01:39:22.361
<i>Victoria,</i>

01:39:22.760 --> 01:39:25.359
I got eyes on. Bailey's heading for the M4.

01:39:25.360 --> 01:39:26.407
Got it.

01:39:28.320 --> 01:39:29.401
Got it!

01:39:30.920 --> 01:39:34.519
This one should stop it
and this one should detonate it.

01:39:34.520 --> 01:39:36.010
It's fifty-fifty, Frank.

01:39:38.840 --> 01:39:39.959
Wait!

01:39:41.880 --> 01:39:43.086
That's weird.

01:39:43.880 --> 01:39:45.441
Do you have any idea what you're doing?

01:39:47.760 --> 01:39:50.079
Wait, wait! Wait!

01:39:50.080 --> 01:39:51.519
Stop cutting wires!

01:39:51.520 --> 01:39:53.443
I knew we were gonna die!

01:39:55.800 --> 01:39:58.929
- Ready to kill this son of a bitch?
- Abso-bloody-lutely.

01:40:01.560 --> 01:40:02.607
Damn it!

01:40:07.640 --> 01:40:08.641
Trouble.

01:40:08.920 --> 01:40:09.921
<i>Marvin!</i>

01:40:10.120 --> 01:40:13.044
Frank, it's two pedals and two sticks.

01:40:13.240 --> 01:40:14.321
Okay.

01:40:51.480 --> 01:40:53.959
Damn it! We missed him.
He's going into the airport.

01:40:53.960 --> 01:40:55.007
<i>Go get him!</i>

01:40:55.240 --> 01:40:57.129
- Well, where are you?
- In trouble.

01:40:57.360 --> 01:40:59.959
<i>Turn back!
You are in restricted airspace.</i>

01:40:59.960 --> 01:41:01.599
Frank, they're gonna blow us outta the sky.

01:41:01.600 --> 01:41:02.721
I wouldn't worry about that.

01:41:03.080 --> 01:41:04.320
The engine's shutting down.

01:41:04.920 --> 01:41:06.490
Mayday! mayday!

01:41:06.680 --> 01:41:07.761
Frank!

01:41:09.040 --> 01:41:10.644
I knew we were gonna die!

01:41:10.760 --> 01:41:11.839
<i>This is your last warning!</i>

01:41:11.840 --> 01:41:14.889
Oh, please, tell me you're not crashing
with a weapon of mass destruction.

01:41:18.120 --> 01:41:20.009
No, Frank, no.

01:41:25.840 --> 01:41:26.841
Oh, God.

01:41:39.680 --> 01:41:41.125
You okay back there, Marvin?

01:41:41.360 --> 01:41:44.679
It wasn't exactly a
three-point landing, Frank.

01:41:44.680 --> 01:41:45.727
How's the bomb doing?

01:41:49.240 --> 01:41:50.730
I can't stop it.

01:42:04.480 --> 01:42:05.925
We gotta get it outta here.

01:42:07.760 --> 01:42:09.364
Hey! Hey!

01:42:09.560 --> 01:42:10.607
Get outta the car.

01:42:22.680 --> 01:42:23.727
Hello, Frank.

01:42:24.280 --> 01:42:25.406
Welcome aboard.

01:42:28.440 --> 01:42:30.522
Always the good soldier, aren't you?

01:42:32.240 --> 01:42:33.526
Stalemate.

01:42:34.040 --> 01:42:38.090
How will you take him out
and not shoot her first?

01:42:39.880 --> 01:42:41.882
Frank, it's okay.

01:42:42.680 --> 01:42:45.081
You can shoot. It's okay.

01:42:46.080 --> 01:42:48.890
Put the gun down.

01:42:49.960 --> 01:42:51.007
Put the gun down!

01:42:53.400 --> 01:42:54.731
Drop the gun!

01:42:57.560 --> 01:43:01.087
Put the gun down, Frankie.

01:43:02.400 --> 01:43:03.561
Thank you.

01:43:04.880 --> 01:43:06.245
Pretty smart.

01:43:07.600 --> 01:43:10.444
So love does conquer all.

01:43:11.480 --> 01:43:13.289
Go to your golden warrior.

01:43:16.080 --> 01:43:17.127
That's a good girl.

01:43:19.440 --> 01:43:20.441
Aw!

01:43:23.240 --> 01:43:24.287
Come here.

01:43:24.480 --> 01:43:27.245
Ah! It's so sweet.

01:43:28.800 --> 01:43:32.691
Now leave the plane.
Take Nightshade with you.

01:43:34.760 --> 01:43:35.807
Bye, Frank.

01:43:38.160 --> 01:43:39.605
Sweet dreams.

01:43:55.640 --> 01:43:57.483
Why didn't you just shoot me?

01:44:16.200 --> 01:44:18.806
- What happened?
- I couldn't disarm it.

01:44:26.960 --> 01:44:28.530
Oh, crap.

01:44:30.520 --> 01:44:31.521
Marvin,

01:44:31.880 --> 01:44:33.370
it's going to detonate?

01:44:33.720 --> 01:44:34.846
Yeah.

01:44:35.000 --> 01:44:36.206
Put your arms around me.

01:44:59.560 --> 01:45:00.641
Oh...

01:45:02.240 --> 01:45:03.969
I didn't see that one coming.

01:45:23.240 --> 01:45:25.447
There's something you don't see every day.

01:45:30.880 --> 01:45:32.564
You put the bomb on the plane.

01:45:36.280 --> 01:45:39.602
And, um, you didn't think to mention that?

01:45:39.800 --> 01:45:41.484
You blew up my plane.

01:45:41.760 --> 01:45:42.761
Sorry.

01:45:42.880 --> 01:45:45.963
I was wrong? So we're not even gonna die?

01:45:46.480 --> 01:45:47.481
Not yet.

01:45:49.080 --> 01:45:53.399
I was actually starting to like you.
I was even thinking about not killing you.

01:45:53.400 --> 01:45:55.607
This is what happens when
you try to save the world.

01:45:55.800 --> 01:45:57.039
Han. Han, you can't

01:45:57.040 --> 01:45:58.610
- put a price on these things.
- Uh-uh.

01:45:58.760 --> 01:46:03.129
You owe me 30 mil for the plane.
And 20 for not killing you.

01:46:03.600 --> 01:46:05.443
You're a dead man, Moses.

01:46:07.600 --> 01:46:08.931
Thanks for your help.

01:46:10.640 --> 01:46:11.801
Really.

01:46:14.160 --> 01:46:15.321
You think he means it?

01:46:15.560 --> 01:46:16.925
Nah, he's a nice guy.

01:46:17.120 --> 01:46:18.406
I mean it, Frank!

01:46:18.640 --> 01:46:19.801
All right.

01:46:23.480 --> 01:46:24.561
Aw!

01:46:24.760 --> 01:46:26.603
They're going to be right as rain.

01:46:28.760 --> 01:46:32.128
He made the run to emotional safety.

01:46:36.520 --> 01:46:37.646
So...

01:46:38.640 --> 01:46:40.642
I did hear about this job in Caracas.

01:46:42.640 --> 01:46:43.801
And?

01:46:57.840 --> 01:47:00.491
Don't look at me. She's your girlfriend.

01:47:04.200 --> 01:47:05.326
Oh.

01:47:06.320 --> 01:47:07.321
Come on.
