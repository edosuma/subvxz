Yes! You could have "Glandular Distrophy"

No. Yes! He said it was a picture book.

the pictures were, man.

Uh, have you seen how filthy
my people are, Clover?

Every one of them could be a patient zero
waiting to wipe out the whole kingdom!

01:40.391 --> 01:43.561
Actually, a kingdom-wide
hand-washing program isn't a bad idea.

01:43.645 --> 01:47.065
Didn't Mort find a tub of hand sanitizer
in junk harbor last week?

Mmm.

Look at them, Nurse Phantom.
So many test subjects.

02:05.625 --> 02:08.962
And I don't even have
to dig any of them up. [chuckles]

02:09.045 --> 02:11.631
I don't know why I'm here.
I'm in perfect health.

Oh, Morty. Have you brought me a gift?

02:33.945 --> 02:36.281
I got a busy schedule,

-[screams in surprise]

In my expert's opinion,
as a wildly discredited snake doctor

who operates [shouts] out of a cave...

03:06.019 --> 03:07.145

03:13.776 --> 03:14.694
What are you on about?

03:14.777 --> 03:18.406
Two of the results were
[hisses] disturbing.

03:18.489 --> 03:22.994
According to my tests,
Mort is only 40% lemur.

03:23.077 --> 03:25.246
The other 60% is made up of

03:25.330 --> 03:27.624
-bear, starfish, sand...
-Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

03:27.707 --> 03:29.667
-...pot belly pig, cactus...
-Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

03:29.751 --> 03:31.711
-...and a spool of copper wire.
-Mm-hmm. Copper wire.

03:31.794 --> 03:33.087
You forgot wood chips.

03:33.171 --> 03:37.175
What? Oh, yes. Sorry. And wood chips.

03:37.258 --> 03:38.676
Wait, you said there were two?

03:38.760 --> 03:44.057
Yes. The other disturbing results
belong to... Maurice!

03:44.140 --> 03:45.141

-[shouts] Me?

03:45.225 --> 03:46.184
Mo-Mo?

03:46.267 --> 03:50.897
I'm afraid, Maurice, as far as I can tell,
you're not a lemur at all.

03:50.980 --> 03:54.651
You are, in fact, an [shouts] aye-aye!

03:54.734 --> 03:57.654
-Huh?
-Well, of course he's a... Wait. What?

03:57.737 --> 03:58.655
Impossible.

03:58.738 --> 04:00.823
He looks nothing like an aye-aye.

04:00.907 --> 04:02.033
He doesn't even stink.

04:02.116 --> 04:03.493
Hmm. I don't know about that.

04:03.576 --> 04:05.578
-Where are you hiding that musk gland?
-[groaning]

04:05.662 --> 04:07.497

04:10.208 --> 04:11.668
-[Mort screams]
-Redo the test!

04:11.751 --> 04:15.964
That would require me knowing
what I did the first time. [chuckles]

04:16.047 --> 04:18.633
King Julien, I am not an aye-aye.

04:18.716 --> 04:20.385
-[Masikura] I'm sorry, Maurice.
-[exclaims in surprise]

04:20.468 --> 04:23.221
But the crazy snake doctor might be right.

04:23.304 --> 04:26.307
-I am?
-You have lived here all your life,

04:26.391 --> 04:28.726
but you were not born here.

04:28.810 --> 04:30.270
[whimpering]

04:30.353 --> 04:34.274
It was a long time ago.
King Julien was just a baby

04:34.357 --> 04:36.651
traveling with his parents
through the realm.

04:37.110 --> 04:40.238
Late one night,
just outside the aye-aye kingdom,

04:40.321 --> 04:43.324
while Princess Julienne
and Prince Barty slept...

04:43.408 --> 04:47.078
-[baby crying]
-...baby Prince Julien heard a sound.

04:47.161 --> 04:50.081
The Prince followed the crying
into a nearby field,

04:50.164 --> 04:52.542
-and there he found a baby.

-Hmm.

[sobbing]

04:58.840 --> 05:03.094
That's a beautiful story, Masikura.
But what happened to the baby?

05:03.177 --> 05:04.929
Uh, the baby was Maurice.

05:05.013 --> 05:06.222
-[groaning] Wait.
-[exclaims]

05:06.306 --> 05:09.350
Masikura, please come back.
I have more questions.

05:09.434 --> 05:12.854
I always knew I was adopted,
but I never knew where I came from.

05:12.937 --> 05:16.566
Was there anything left with me?
A clue to who I am?

05:16.649 --> 05:19.068
-[clinking]
-Only the blanket you were found in,

05:19.152 --> 05:21.154
and this bell.

05:24.615 --> 05:26.367
No, no, Your Majesty.

05:26.451 --> 05:29.329
I... I need to be alone for a while.

05:30.330 --> 05:32.957
Give it some time. It's a lot to take in.

05:35.209 --> 05:36.878
Mo-Mo! Hey, buddy.

05:36.961 --> 05:40.840
You up for some early morning tramping
and a shvitz? Hmm?

05:43.092 --> 05:46.471
[Maurice]  Dear King Julien,
since it is unclear

05:46.554 --> 05:48.014
whether I am an aye-aye,

05:48.097 --> 05:52.351
I am going to their kingdom
to find your brother, Prince Brodney,

05:52.435 --> 05:54.353
and get some answers.

05:54.437 --> 05:56.314
Hmm. I wonder who this is from?

05:56.481 --> 05:58.399
-[sighing] It's from me.
-Hmm?

05:58.483 --> 05:59.901
[screams] Don't do that!

05:59.984 --> 06:02.236
I'd hoped to be gone before you found it.

06:02.320 --> 06:03.738
Found? Huh.

06:03.821 --> 06:06.741
Is this about your
"I was abandoned in a baby patch

06:06.824 --> 06:10.369
and I have no idea of my origins" thingy?
Buddy, nobody cares.

06:10.453 --> 06:12.955
I cares! I don't know who I am!

06:13.039 --> 06:14.415
-Of course you do.
-[grunts]

06:14.499 --> 06:16.667
You're my best friend and royal advisor.

06:16.751 --> 06:19.587
But what if that's not my destiny?
Or yours?

06:19.670 --> 06:20.755
We need to know.

06:20.838 --> 06:21.756
Need to know what?

06:21.839 --> 06:24.717
Who we would have been
if we'd never found each other.

06:24.801 --> 06:25.802
Oh.

06:26.219 --> 06:28.179
Oh, uh, yeah, okay. I see.

06:28.262 --> 06:29.263
King Julien--

06:29.347 --> 06:30.723
No, I get it.

06:30.807 --> 06:33.267
You think you would have done
better without me.

06:33.351 --> 06:34.894
That is not what I'm saying.

06:34.977 --> 06:37.230
Oh! Oh, no? 'Cause it sure sounds like it.

06:37.313 --> 06:39.398
It sounds kind of like,
[imitating Maurice] "I could have done

06:39.482 --> 06:41.192
better without King Julien.

06:41.275 --> 06:44.529
Always have to clean up
his messes and his dumb ideas."

06:44.612 --> 06:47.031
This is why I didn't wanna be here
when you read the letter.

06:47.115 --> 06:47.990
[both gasp]

06:48.074 --> 06:48.991
Maurice? Where are you--

06:49.075 --> 06:50.618
-Let him go, Clover.
-[sighs]

06:50.701 --> 06:52.745
Maurice doesn't want our kingdom anymore.

06:52.829 --> 06:55.248
He wants his
[imitating Maurice] "own destiny."

06:55.331 --> 06:56.791
-[chuckles] I don't think so, Maurice.
-Huh?

06:56.874 --> 06:58.501
Take good care of him.

-Hmm?

07:03.381 --> 07:05.758
Thanks for doing me a huge favor!

07:05.842 --> 07:10.763
Without you, I'm finally going to be able
to spray my ideas all over this kingdom

07:10.847 --> 07:13.808
and you're never going
to be able to say no again.

07:13.891 --> 07:15.476

This isn't a birthday party.

08:06.736 --> 08:09.822
[gasps] It isn't? I warned Banana!

08:09.906 --> 08:12.950
You're not the only fruit

-Huh?

08:32.345 --> 08:34.013
Name's Brosalind.

09:11.259 --> 09:13.135
-[whimpering]
-It can't be!

09:13.219 --> 09:14.804
[exclaims] It's him!

09:14.887 --> 09:16.639
Uh, who? Who am I?

09:16.722 --> 09:19.684
Someone who we thought was dead.

09:19.892 --> 09:21.143
-The Chosen One.
-[bell clinking]

09:21.227 --> 09:22.061
[gasps in panic]

09:23.271 --> 09:24.438
Is he gonna be all right?

09:24.522 --> 09:29.193
I'm not a wizard, Clover,
or a real doctor, for that matter.

09:29.277 --> 09:34.407
But I can tell you this. He will never
play the trombone [shouts] again!

09:34.907 --> 09:36.742
He doesn't play the trombone now.

09:36.826 --> 09:38.327
Then why are we here?

09:38.411 --> 09:40.580
-Because the king is in a coma!
-[Dr. S groaning]

09:40.913 --> 09:44.458
-Oh. Good to know.
-Maurice. Maurice.

09:44.542 --> 09:46.586
Maurice is gone, Your Majesty.

09:46.669 --> 09:48.004
-[groans]
-Your Majesty?

09:48.087 --> 09:49.505
-[Mort shrieking]
-We're losing him!

09:49.589 --> 09:52.174
-Nurse Phantom, the paddles!
-[shrieking continues]

09:52.258 --> 09:55.303
Wait. That beeping isn't coming
from the machine.

09:55.386 --> 09:57.847
[shrieking]

09:57.930 --> 10:00.725
Oh, sorry. I make that sound
when I'm nervous.

10:00.808 --> 10:05.146
It's time for a "Come to Frank" moment,
everyone.

10:05.271 --> 10:08.816
We need to accept
that Mr. King Julien's mind

10:08.899 --> 10:13.654
has mostly likely been [shouts] destroyed!

10:13.738 --> 10:14.655
[all gasp]

10:14.739 --> 10:17.742
Or not. Hard to tell
without the proper equipment

10:17.825 --> 10:19.785
I wouldn't know how to use anyway.

10:20.036 --> 10:21.954
What I'm trying to say is--

10:22.038 --> 10:24.415
It's up to King Julien
to save his own mind.

10:25.291 --> 10:28.002
I just wish we knew
what was going on in there.

10:28.753 --> 10:32.423
[Mort] King Julien, King Julien,
King Julien!

10:32.590 --> 10:34.091
Can you hear me?

10:34.300 --> 10:36.010
You don't need to be on his chest.

10:36.594 --> 10:40.681
Don't tell me what I can and can't do
with his chest, Rob McTodd.

10:40.765 --> 10:41.807
-[groans]
-[Mort screams]

10:41.891 --> 10:43.851
-[panting]
-I'm okay.

10:43.934 --> 10:45.561
-[bubbling]
-The acid broke my fall.

10:46.145 --> 10:49.148
Rob? Huh, your face. [chuckles]

10:49.231 --> 10:50.775
-It's not all gross anymore.
-[laughs]

10:50.858 --> 10:55.196
You know me, Julie. Got some pureed
jellyfish injected into my brow.

10:55.279 --> 10:56.697
Tightened things right up.

10:57.073 --> 10:58.157
[skin creaking]

10:58.741 --> 11:00.785
-Where's Maurice?
-Maurice who?

11:00.868 --> 11:01.744
Not funny, Rob.

11:01.827 --> 11:04.163
I'm sorry, Julie.
I don't know any Maurice.

11:04.246 --> 11:06.248
-Mort, you know a Maurice?
-[groaning]

11:06.332 --> 11:08.751
Never heard of him! [groaning]

11:09.543 --> 11:13.631
There is a Maurice and he
was my best friend and royal advisor.

11:13.714 --> 11:16.926
Julie, I'm your best friend
and royal advisor.

11:17.009 --> 11:18.677
Wha-- Since when?

11:18.761 --> 11:21.555
Since I jumped out of that cake
on your uncle's birthday

11:21.639 --> 11:22.681
and scared him to death.

11:25.434 --> 11:26.560
But he survived that.

11:26.644 --> 11:28.396
No. I was there.

11:28.729 --> 11:30.398
Totally dead.

11:30.606 --> 11:32.650
I made a dreamcatcher out of his hair.

11:32.858 --> 11:33.734
-[giggles]
-[pops]

11:33.818 --> 11:34.902
[Mort] Whee!

11:34.985 --> 11:35.903
Uh...

11:36.237 --> 11:37.613
What's with my kingdom?

11:38.781 --> 11:40.032
Looks like Monday to me.

11:40.116 --> 11:44.328
Monday? Why isn't anyone working?
Who is picking the mangoes?

11:44.412 --> 11:48.958
Monday is a holiday. Just like Tuesday,
Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday,

11:49.041 --> 11:50.334
Sunday, and Second Sunday.

11:50.418 --> 11:51.585
Second Sunday?

11:51.669 --> 11:55.005
You added an eighth day because you said
seven days off wasn't enough.

11:55.089 --> 11:57.758
I tried to make that change
years ago, but Maurice--

11:57.842 --> 12:00.428
Once again, Maurice who?

12:00.511 --> 12:03.806
Look, buddy, because of me,
what King Julien wants,

12:03.889 --> 12:06.475
King Julien g-g-g-g-gets.

12:06.559 --> 12:08.436
Public transportation? Check!

12:08.519 --> 12:09.895
-[squawking]
-[lemurs cheering]

12:10.563 --> 12:12.273
[screaming in panic]

12:12.356 --> 12:15.359
-Laugh track inside toilet hut? Check!
-[thuds]

12:17.194 --> 12:20.322
-[laughing track playing]
-Mm-mmm.

12:20.406 --> 12:22.491
You know I can never say no to you.

12:22.575 --> 12:24.326
And neither can anyone else
in the kingdom.

12:24.410 --> 12:27.329
It's the law.
Just remember who the handsome one is.

12:27.413 --> 12:28.289
[laughing]

12:28.372 --> 12:29.206
Okay, then.

12:29.707 --> 12:30.749
Hmm.

12:30.833 --> 12:32.126
Okay, Julien, check it.

12:32.209 --> 12:34.170
This is clearly a dream where your kingdom

12:34.253 --> 12:36.630
is the most off the hizzy
party kingdom ever

12:36.714 --> 12:38.757
because no one ever says no to you.

12:38.841 --> 12:40.634
Wow. This is a good dream.

12:40.718 --> 12:44.430
No, this is a bad dream!
[shouts] A horrible dream!

12:44.513 --> 12:47.266
There should always be someone
to say no to you.

12:47.349 --> 12:50.060
You know how dangerous you are
when you're left unattended.

12:50.144 --> 12:51.312
How did this happen?

12:52.021 --> 12:53.189
Maurice.

12:53.439 --> 12:56.734
This is what my destiny
would have been without him.

12:56.817 --> 12:59.111
We got to figure out something
to snap you out of this dream

12:59.195 --> 13:01.155
-so you can find Maurice.
-[rattling]

13:01.238 --> 13:02.239
-[thumps]
-[squeaks]

13:02.698 --> 13:03.616
Good times!

13:04.408 --> 13:05.284
I got it!

13:05.367 --> 13:07.953
You need to find someone to punch you.

13:08.037 --> 13:10.289
Uh, hold up, little me.

13:10.414 --> 13:13.459
How will someone punching me
get me out of this dream?

13:13.542 --> 13:16.253
It'll jolt you back to reality, I think.

13:16.337 --> 13:17.838
I don't know, it's dream logic.

13:17.922 --> 13:21.217
You're talking to a miniature version
of yourself who's standing on your brain.

13:21.300 --> 13:22.134
Go with it.

13:22.635 --> 13:24.303
But, I'm king.

13:24.386 --> 13:27.515
Who would dare punch the king?

13:27.598 --> 13:28.807
-[knocking]
-[Julien] Clover?

13:28.891 --> 13:30.309
-Are you in there?
-[door creaking]

13:30.392 --> 13:32.186
-I need some discipline right now!
-[thuds]

13:32.269 --> 13:33.687
[gasps, whimpering]

13:35.689 --> 13:36.565
Clover?

13:36.649 --> 13:38.859
-[loud footsteps]
-Clover?

13:38.943 --> 13:42.488
[screeches loudly]

13:42.780 --> 13:44.114
[panting]

13:44.198 --> 13:47.618
[stammers] You're all swollen.
What happened?

13:47.701 --> 13:49.578
What happened? You happened!

13:49.662 --> 13:52.164
-Whoa!
-You said security concerns

13:52.248 --> 13:54.333
-interfered with you dropping booty.
-[thuds]

13:54.416 --> 13:56.585
-Whoa!
-So you had Rob fire me.

13:56.669 --> 14:00.798
Legally, I cannot be held responsible
because Maurice should have stopped Rob.

14:00.881 --> 14:02.174
Who's Maurice?

14:02.258 --> 14:03.092
Exactly.

14:03.175 --> 14:04.009
[alarm blaring]

14:04.093 --> 14:06.136
It's cake o'clock. Excuse me for a moment.

14:07.054 --> 14:08.806
I love cake o'clock.

14:09.390 --> 14:11.308
[shouts] Take one bite
and I'll tear your arm off!

14:11.392 --> 14:12.726
-[screams]
-[thuds]

14:12.810 --> 14:15.354
[grunts, munching]

14:17.189 --> 14:19.525
[continues munching, burps loudly]

14:19.608 --> 14:20.568
That's better.

14:20.651 --> 14:24.446
Clover, this may sound strange,
but this is a dream, a bad dream.

14:24.530 --> 14:26.699
-I need you to hit me and wake me up...
-Huh?

14:26.782 --> 14:28.158
...so the bad dream will be over

14:28.242 --> 14:30.160
and you won't be all bloated
and gross anymore.

14:30.244 --> 14:31.662
-Okay.
-Really?

14:31.745 --> 14:34.540
No questions? Kind of a weird request.

14:34.623 --> 14:35.791
-[cracks knuckles]
-Nope.

14:35.875 --> 14:39.211
Mmm... [panting]

14:39.295 --> 14:40.754
Hold on for a sec.

14:41.130 --> 14:43.299
Just a little bit hot in here.

14:43.382 --> 14:47.845
Yeah. Clo-Clo, maybe it would
just be better if I ran into your fist.

14:47.928 --> 14:48.762
On it.

14:51.765 --> 14:53.809
[inhales, screaming]

14:53.893 --> 14:55.686
-[thumps]
-[screaming]

14:55.769 --> 14:57.479
[groaning]

14:57.605 --> 15:01.942
Nurse Phantom! You're all gross again.

15:02.026 --> 15:04.862
-And Clover, you've deflated.
-Hmm?

15:04.945 --> 15:07.281
And Mort, you're still a freak.

15:07.364 --> 15:09.700
Yay! He remembers me! [screams]

15:09.783 --> 15:11.827
-[thuds]
-He's okay! [screams]

15:11.911 --> 15:15.581
King Julien, you fell out of a tree
and you hit your head pretty hard.

15:15.664 --> 15:17.750
It was more than that, Clover.

15:18.000 --> 15:21.128
I saw what life would
have been like without Maurice.

15:21.712 --> 15:24.131
I don't care if he wants
to find his destiny

15:24.214 --> 15:27.843
because finding him
in that baby patch was my destiny.

15:27.927 --> 15:30.721
-He made me the king I am.
-[gasps in excitement]

15:30.804 --> 15:32.932
We have to find him.

15:33.766 --> 15:35.184
[Brosalind] Why are you really here?

15:35.267 --> 15:38.020
Is the aye-aye kingdom in danger?

15:38.103 --> 15:39.605
Is something coming?

15:39.688 --> 15:40.814
I told you, I don't know.

15:40.898 --> 15:44.568
All right. Back-off, you meanies!
Maurice is a friend of mine.

15:44.652 --> 15:46.028
-[growls]
-Thanks, Ted.

15:46.111 --> 15:50.449
I say we deliver him
to the old bell gods right now,

15:50.532 --> 15:52.284
like the prophecy demands,

15:52.368 --> 15:54.745
-and throw the other one in as a bonus!
-Huh?

15:54.828 --> 15:57.790
Oh! Actually, I barely know him. [laughs]

15:57.873 --> 16:00.668
Who are you, mister? Ew, go away!

16:00.751 --> 16:01.961
-[both grunting]
-[aye-ayes chattering]

16:02.044 --> 16:04.463
Come with me if you wanna live.

16:04.838 --> 16:05.881
-[Maurice groans]
-[aye-ayes scream]

16:07.508 --> 16:08.968
[Maurice] Why are you helping us?

16:09.051 --> 16:12.304
I need to know how you're still alive
and what it means.

16:12.388 --> 16:15.641
Wait a minute, hold the conch shell.
You know Maurice?

16:15.724 --> 16:17.351
Of course I do.

16:17.434 --> 16:21.021
A sister always knows her...
[grunting] brother.

16:21.105 --> 16:22.147
[both] Brother?

16:23.983 --> 16:28.445
There is a belief among our... people
that every millennia,

16:28.529 --> 16:31.573
-a beautiful aye-aye child is born.
-[bell clinking]

16:31.657 --> 16:35.494
We call that child the Chosen One.

16:35.577 --> 16:38.998
And you think that's me?
I'm the beautiful child?

16:39.081 --> 16:40.249
[Ted laughing]

16:40.332 --> 16:42.459
Oh, she's messing with you, Maurice.

16:42.543 --> 16:44.670
[both grunting in anger]

16:44.753 --> 16:46.255
Or not. Go on.

16:46.839 --> 16:49.383
But how can I be an aye-aye
if I can't even...

16:49.466 --> 16:51.010
-[grunting]
-[squeaks]

16:52.052 --> 16:56.849
The proper clench and release
to activate your musk gland is simple.

16:56.974 --> 17:00.686
It's the belief you could do it
that is hard.

17:00.769 --> 17:02.604
[sarcastically] Right.

17:02.980 --> 17:06.692
So if I'm this Chosen One,
does that mean I'm royalty?

17:06.775 --> 17:09.278
[chuckles] Do I have, like,
special powers?

17:09.361 --> 17:11.405
Not... not exactly.

17:11.488 --> 17:14.158
[Brosalind]
Upon the birth of the Chosen One,

17:14.241 --> 17:16.618
-a festival is thrown to celebrate.
-[baby coos]

17:16.702 --> 17:19.663
The Chosen One is carried
through the square

17:19.747 --> 17:25.461
to the far end of the kingdom,
where it is left to be sacrificed

17:25.544 --> 17:27.838
to the bell gods
in the center of the Earth.

17:27.921 --> 17:29.923
Wait. Sacrificed?

17:30.007 --> 17:34.762
How else are we to achieve peace
and prosperity other than sacrificing

17:34.845 --> 17:38.182
one of our own to sentient bells
who live in the center of the Earth?

17:38.265 --> 17:39.183
[murmuring]

17:39.266 --> 17:42.978
Look at us.
We need all the help we can get.

17:43.062 --> 17:46.982
You know, maybe the reason the aye-aye
aren't known for their looks, you know,

17:47.066 --> 17:50.402
is because you sacrifice
your most [shouts] beautiful child!

17:50.986 --> 17:54.364
Sentient bells? Koo-koo-crazy-town.

17:54.448 --> 17:56.825
Uh, we believe in sky gods, Ted.

17:56.909 --> 17:59.119
Well, sure, but the sky gods are real.

17:59.203 --> 18:00.120
[Maurice sighs]

18:00.204 --> 18:02.915
Did I even have a name
before you left me there to die?

18:02.998 --> 18:05.417
[stammering] It was Bricky.

18:05.501 --> 18:08.629
"B" plus the sound "Ricky."

18:08.712 --> 18:12.508
I wish you could have known our parents,
Brodger and Brachel,

18:12.591 --> 18:14.676
but we lost them in a foosa attack.

18:15.177 --> 18:17.304
Now it makes sense
why they were so freaked out

18:17.387 --> 18:20.099
at the tavern. If I wasn't sacrificed...

18:20.182 --> 18:22.851
It's only a matter of time

18:22.935 --> 18:25.979
before the bell gods retaliate.

18:26.063 --> 18:27.231
-[lemur] False gods...
-[all gasp]

18:27.356 --> 18:28.941
...are the least of your problems.

18:30.109 --> 18:32.402
Oh, my. Are those the bell gods?

18:32.486 --> 18:36.657
-No. Worse! Mountain lemurs.
-[Maurice whimpers]

18:37.282 --> 18:41.078
[drums beating]

18:41.161 --> 18:42.704
How come they tied you up in sacks?

18:42.788 --> 18:46.166
It keeps us from using
our musk glands for defense.

18:46.250 --> 18:48.418
Stink gets trapped in the bag.

18:48.502 --> 18:50.504
Gonna have to remember that one.

18:50.587 --> 18:52.714
I've been suffering
from IBS my whole life.

18:52.798 --> 18:55.384
Poor Dorothy, she's been trapped
under the bed sheets

18:55.467 --> 18:57.386
-more than once with my funk.
-[gulps]

18:57.469 --> 19:01.140
She calls it the Madagascar Oven.
[laughs] It's awful.

19:01.223 --> 19:02.641
-[Ted screaming]
-[Maurice and Brosalind groan]

19:02.724 --> 19:04.309
Hurry it up, you skrogs.

19:04.393 --> 19:06.937
-[clattering]
-We regroup with the Master at sunrise.

19:07.020 --> 19:10.274
We come back without supplies
for the raid, he'll have our skins.

19:10.357 --> 19:11.483
What about them?

19:11.567 --> 19:12.568
[all gasp]

19:12.651 --> 19:14.736
Let me cut off their paws,
so Master can use them

19:14.820 --> 19:16.488
-to scratch his evil itchy bits.
-[whimpers]

19:17.072 --> 19:18.490
-[groans in pain] Huh?
-Quiet, Benson!

19:18.574 --> 19:21.410
The Master's
itchy bits are off limits to you.

19:21.493 --> 19:23.412
I thought mountain lemurs
had been wiped out.

19:23.495 --> 19:27.833
Hardly. In fact, reports have
their numbers [shouts] growing.

19:27.916 --> 19:30.794
Ted, if the mountain lemurs
continue moving west,

19:30.878 --> 19:33.839
our kingdom, and the aye-aye kingdom
could be in danger.

19:33.922 --> 19:34.798
We have to do something.

19:34.882 --> 19:37.384
I am doing something, fear tinkling.

19:37.467 --> 19:39.636
-Ew.
-[Maurice sighs] Fear tinkle.

19:39.720 --> 19:43.891
Guess it's up to the Chosen One
aka The Sacrifice.

19:43.974 --> 19:46.268
Bricky, there's too many of them!

19:46.351 --> 19:48.478
I'm not planning on beatin' them.

19:48.562 --> 19:52.608
Ted, get my sister and the others free
and warn our kingdoms about what's coming.

19:52.691 --> 19:54.860
-Uh...
-I'll distract them as long as I can.

19:54.943 --> 19:58.238
Tell King Julien, I'm sorry, I was wrong.

19:58.322 --> 20:00.199
If he hadn't rescued me
from that baby patch,

20:00.282 --> 20:02.659
my life would have been nothing
more than a sacrifice.

20:02.743 --> 20:05.329
My destiny was to be found by him.

20:06.330 --> 20:08.874
[screaming unintelligibly, chomps]

20:08.957 --> 20:10.542
-[groaning]
-[grunting, screaming]

20:10.626 --> 20:11.668
[groans] Oh!

20:11.752 --> 20:12.753
[mountain lemur 1] Get him off me!

20:12.836 --> 20:14.796
-Wow. Go Maurice!
-[crashing]

20:15.380 --> 20:16.757
-He's actually beating them.
-[crashing]

20:16.840 --> 20:19.384
-[screaming]
-[thumping]

20:19.468 --> 20:20.969
-[grunting]
-[screaming]

20:21.053 --> 20:22.095
-[groaning]
-Oh!

20:22.179 --> 20:26.725
-And now, they're beating him. Darn.
-Stop your gawking and untie us!

20:26.808 --> 20:27.851
But they're gonna kill him!

20:27.935 --> 20:30.354
It should have happened a long time ago.

20:30.437 --> 20:35.150
No! Any prophecy that would
sacrifice a child is wrong.

20:35.234 --> 20:38.237
-I'm not losing my brother again.
-[growls in anger]

20:38.320 --> 20:40.822
[shouting] Bricky!
There's a way to stop them!

20:40.948 --> 20:42.991
[stammers] Use your musk gland!

20:43.075 --> 20:46.078
[shouting] Are you crazy, woman?
I don't even know if I'm an aye-aye!

20:46.161 --> 20:47.704
-Just go! Save yourself!
-[mountain lemurs growling]

20:47.788 --> 20:49.915
You are an aye-aye!

20:49.998 --> 20:55.128
All you have to do is clench and believe.

20:55.212 --> 20:57.881
-I don't care what you are. You die.
-[groans]

20:57.965 --> 20:59.132
-[thuds]
-[groaning]

20:59.216 --> 21:00.926
[panting]

21:01.009 --> 21:02.052
[exclaiming affirmatively]

21:02.135 --> 21:03.053
[growls]

21:03.136 --> 21:05.264
[grunting]

21:05.347 --> 21:06.306
[rattling]

21:06.390 --> 21:07.891
-[grunting loudly]
-[all gasp]

21:07.975 --> 21:09.935
[farts loudly]

21:10.018 --> 21:12.062
[mountain lemurs clamoring in panic]

21:12.145 --> 21:13.480
[mountain lemur 1] Forget the mission!

21:13.563 --> 21:15.482
He is the Chosen One.

21:15.983 --> 21:17.776
-[thuds]
-All right, you lot. Freeze!

21:17.859 --> 21:19.444
-[rumbling]
-[mountain lemurs screaming]

21:19.528 --> 21:20.362
[mountain lemur 2] Run away!

21:21.196 --> 21:22.239
[sighs in relief]

21:22.739 --> 21:24.116
[gasps] King Julien!

21:24.199 --> 21:25.951
[gasps, chuckles] Yes!

21:30.831 --> 21:34.543
You are never allowed to leave again,
and that's an order.

21:34.626 --> 21:37.838
You are my advisor, and I need you,

21:37.921 --> 21:40.173
-like, real bad, Mo-Mo.
-Mmm.

21:40.257 --> 21:44.303
[sobbing] I mean, I had this nightmare,
dude. It really freaked me out, man.

21:44.386 --> 21:49.516
Don't you worry, Your Majesty.
I'm not going anywhere ever again.

21:49.599 --> 21:50.767
[sniffs, gasps]

21:50.851 --> 21:52.352
Oh, dude, is that you?

21:52.436 --> 21:55.147
Ugh. Get some air freshener, man. Aah!

21:55.230 --> 21:59.693
It's like a pair of crabs in a sauna
fighting over a wedge of feta cheese.

21:59.776 --> 22:03.196
-[Maurice groans]
-Prince Brodney, the kingdom is in danger.

22:03.280 --> 22:06.283
Those mountain lemurs
were talking about a raid.

22:06.366 --> 22:07.951
If it's true, King Julien,

22:08.035 --> 22:10.537
the lemur kingdom
could be in danger as well.

22:10.620 --> 22:12.998
-[gasps]
-Mmm. Uh...

22:15.125 --> 22:16.168
-Ringo.
-[bell jingling]

22:16.251 --> 22:17.919
There is news from our spies above.

22:18.003 --> 22:21.923
Maurice, the Chosen One, has returned.

22:22.007 --> 22:25.469
If this is true, the prophecy foretold

22:25.552 --> 22:28.430
by the Great Jingle-Jangle

22:28.513 --> 22:30.724
has come to pass!

22:30.807 --> 22:31.933
You mean...

22:32.017 --> 22:33.393
Yes, Dingbert.

22:33.560 --> 22:37.022
The war of the beasts has begun!

22:37.105 --> 22:40.067
-[bells jingling]
-[laughing]

22:41.151 --> 22:42.986
[jazz music playing]
