<i>This has nothing
to do with me, okay?</i>

03:07.260 --> 03:09.151
Are you okay?

03:09.796 --> 03:11.830
Yeah. Fine. I'm fine.

04:12.423 --> 04:13.983
Zeigler?

04:24.935 --> 04:26.464
Zeigler?

04:37.548 --> 04:39.072
Excuse me.

04:52.630 --> 04:54.163
Zeigler!

05:26.229 --> 05:27.594
Zeig?

05:33.234 --> 05:34.801
Zeigler?

06:15.577 --> 06:17.377
My boy hooked me up, okay?

06:17.412 --> 06:19.446
I mean, I'm talking, now,
free passwords...

06:19.481 --> 06:20.641
...to, like, over 100 sites.

06:21.082 --> 06:22.843
So we're talking...
Thank you.

06:22.884 --> 06:24.312
...horny coeds...

06:24.352 --> 06:26.915
...Japanese girls in bondage,
and...

06:26.987 --> 06:28.215
...what... granny trannys...

06:28.255 --> 06:29.579
Okay, you did not just say that.

06:29.623 --> 06:31.054
I never looked at 'em. Okay?

06:31.091 --> 06:32.991
I'm just saying,
I have the passwords...

06:33.126 --> 06:35.060
- He totally looked.
- You know he did.

06:35.096 --> 06:37.792
I call it having access
to information.

06:37.832 --> 06:40.463
It's called
having a girlfriend, Stone.

06:40.700 --> 06:41.660
You should check it out.

06:41.701 --> 06:42.795
- Damn!
- Wow, that's harsh.

06:42.836 --> 06:44.369
Sorry.
Shrink in training...

06:44.404 --> 06:45.966
I gotta tell it like it is.

06:52.078 --> 06:53.375
Tim!

06:53.912 --> 06:55.079
I'm right here.

06:55.113 --> 06:56.505
What?

06:57.348 --> 06:58.881
Check this out.

06:59.417 --> 07:01.044
- Oh, he's cute.
- Oh, yeah.

07:01.086 --> 07:03.117
Scroll down...

07:04.455 --> 07:05.950
- Gay!
- Absolutely.

07:06.058 --> 07:06.825
What?!

07:06.859 --> 07:08.822
It's a boy-toy,
who saw your name is Izzie...

07:08.860 --> 07:10.627
...and thought you was a guy.

07:10.863 --> 07:12.423
You need to stop hatin'.

07:12.564 --> 07:14.031
- Oh, I'm hatin'?
- Yeah.

07:14.365 --> 07:15.128
Tim?!

07:15.167 --> 07:16.464
What?! It's not me!

07:16.702 --> 07:18.099
I swear!

07:21.506 --> 07:22.968
Okay, who we shutting down?

07:23.108 --> 07:24.506
No one.

07:25.141 --> 07:26.500
No, I just...

07:26.710 --> 07:28.911
...thought Josh might call.

07:29.180 --> 07:30.804
He's been avoiding me
for over a week.

07:31.948 --> 07:33.676
Our relationship
has been reduced...

07:33.718 --> 07:35.215
...to text-messaging.

07:35.453 --> 07:36.650
How tragic is that?

07:36.688 --> 07:38.021
Okay, Mattie, come on.

07:38.156 --> 07:39.924
I know... I know.

07:40.058 --> 07:42.793
I guess I'm still hoping
he'll just...

07:42.928 --> 07:44.322
...figure it out.

07:44.462 --> 07:46.293
You need to let go, okay?

07:46.431 --> 07:48.762
You guys have been breaking up
way longer than you hooked up.

07:49.100 --> 07:51.590
If he can't recognize
that you got it going on...

07:51.835 --> 07:53.701
...then... you don't need
to be involved with him.

07:53.838 --> 07:56.133
Besides, look,
it's raining men right now.

07:56.473 --> 07:57.606
Right, guys?

07:57.641 --> 07:59.768
Yo. Ready to dance?

08:00.210 --> 08:01.404
We could do that.

08:01.445 --> 08:02.876
That's what I'm talking about.

08:02.913 --> 08:04.741
- Come on.
- No.

08:05.382 --> 08:07.973
Have you seen me dance?
It's not pretty.

08:12.657 --> 08:14.148
Good night.

08:29.706 --> 08:30.771
Hey!

08:30.807 --> 08:32.465
Don't... do that.

08:32.909 --> 08:34.398
Oh. Sorry.

08:34.543 --> 08:35.905
I wanted out of there.

08:35.979 --> 08:37.472
Thought I'd walk with you.

08:37.813 --> 08:39.275
You live the other way.

08:39.315 --> 08:40.341
I'll take the spiral route.

08:40.383 --> 08:42.817
Plus, you know, single guy,
walking alone, late at night...

08:42.952 --> 08:46.079
Well, thanks.
I'm good from here.

08:46.322 --> 08:47.848
See you tomorrow?

08:48.090 --> 08:49.118
Sure.

08:49.258 --> 08:50.618
Okay. Bye.

09:12.214 --> 09:14.610
<i>You have two new messages.</i>

09:14.650 --> 09:17.309
<i>First message, 9:37 P.M.</i>

09:18.152 --> 09:19.643
<i>Mattie, it's Mom.</i>

09:19.787 --> 09:21.550
<i>This is call number three,
honey.</i>

09:21.689 --> 09:24.252
<i>I know you're busy,
but call me back, okay?</i>

09:24.692 --> 09:26.383
<i>I miss you.</i>

09:27.729 --> 09:30.529
<i>Next message, 10:47 P.M.</i>

09:30.965 --> 09:33.932
<i>Mattie, it's Josh. Um...</i>

09:36.069 --> 09:37.637
<i>Never mind.</i>

09:50.284 --> 09:51.349
<i>This is Josh.</i>

09:51.386 --> 09:53.347
<i>I'm not here right now.
Leave a message.</i>

09:53.587 --> 09:54.652
Josh, it's Mattie.

09:54.689 --> 09:56.079
<i>Pick up.</i>

09:56.124 --> 09:58.415
<i>You haven't returned
one of my calls...</i>

09:59.059 --> 10:00.621
<i>...and now...</i>

10:00.662 --> 10:02.862
...what's with the weird message?

10:28.154 --> 10:29.985
Hey, Iz, are you here?

11:27.077 --> 11:28.577
You know you have to get up.

11:28.612 --> 11:30.009
You have class.

11:34.018 --> 11:35.707
Get up! Now!

11:43.427 --> 11:46.219
<i>Of course there are
other kinds of stalking.</i>

11:46.231 --> 11:49.160
<i>There is public stalking.
There is cyber stalking.</i>

11:49.333 --> 11:51.767
<i>Each with its
own set of behaviors.</i>

11:51.902 --> 11:54.637
<i>What I want to talk about now...</i>

11:55.271 --> 11:58.371
...is stalking,
the pathological mind...

12:00.944 --> 12:02.738
...and the other.

12:03.280 --> 12:05.179
Now, the pathological mind...

12:09.451 --> 12:13.714
The pathological mind can only
satisfy its need for the other...

12:13.756 --> 12:16.017
<i>...by consuming the other...</i>

12:16.558 --> 12:19.125
<i>...leading, once again,
to great need...</i>

12:19.161 --> 12:21.862
...and, of course,
the cycle begins again.

12:22.398 --> 12:27.490
Now, what I'd like you to do Friday,
in preparation for the midterm...

12:27.837 --> 12:31.906
<i>...is write an essay on
what we've spoken about today...</i>

12:31.941 --> 12:33.568
...including in it ritual...

12:33.608 --> 12:35.233
<i>Come on, Mattie, you know
you're gonna have fun.</i>

12:35.277 --> 12:36.938
Chill out, relax.
Have a drink.

12:37.012 --> 12:38.545
- Yeah, but...
- You're gonna come.

12:38.580 --> 12:40.741
We're gonna hang out.
We need this, okay?

12:40.882 --> 12:42.741
I'm gonna call you
right back.

12:44.052 --> 12:46.618
Damn. Y'all look good.

12:49.524 --> 12:50.684
A'ight. Check this out.

12:50.726 --> 12:51.954
I got all the new joint...

12:51.993 --> 12:54.120
Actually, these last four,
y'all have already.

12:54.162 --> 12:55.652
And then, these five,
right here...

12:55.697 --> 12:57.892
...won't even be out
for another month.

12:58.032 --> 12:59.395
Plus, I have some
other ones here...

12:59.434 --> 13:01.799
Yeah. You know, you should
just save us a few little tax dollars...

13:01.935 --> 13:03.694
...and drive yourself
to jail right now.

13:03.738 --> 13:06.364
Can I use your car?
And don't forget, I gotta take you with me...

13:06.373 --> 13:08.364
...because you did buy
some of the stuff.

13:08.509 --> 13:11.573
Oh, and your boy Josh...
Genius!

13:11.711 --> 13:14.210
For every minute
I use on my cellphone...

13:14.248 --> 13:15.715
...I get credited for two.

13:15.750 --> 13:17.348
It's a beautiful thing.

13:17.385 --> 13:19.680
Excuse me for one second.
What's up?

13:19.820 --> 13:21.617
All right,
we're going to lunch, right?

13:21.655 --> 13:23.414
Uh, actually, I'm gonna
hang here for a bit.

13:23.458 --> 13:24.725
But I'll call you.

13:24.759 --> 13:25.826
Okay. Um...

13:25.860 --> 13:26.984
I'm gonna see you later then?

13:27.127 --> 13:28.560
Maybe.

14:16.442 --> 14:18.474
Josh?

14:26.885 --> 14:28.876
Josh, it's Mattie.

14:31.389 --> 14:32.985
Josh?

15:22.004 --> 15:23.302
Oh, shit!

15:33.181 --> 15:34.774
Josh.

15:38.354 --> 15:39.849
Hey.

15:42.825 --> 15:44.888
Why don't you answer my calls?

15:45.027 --> 15:47.319
Everyone is worried about you.

15:56.071 --> 15:59.204
Stay here. All right?

16:25.933 --> 16:28.566
Oh, my... Josh!

16:31.038 --> 16:32.906
Josh?

16:43.851 --> 16:45.343
Oh, my God.

17:23.689 --> 17:25.220
<i>Hello, this is Louise Webber.</i>

17:25.457 --> 17:28.021
<i>Leave your name and message
and I'll get back to you.</i>

17:28.895 --> 17:31.759
Hey, Mom. Tag, you're it.

17:32.697 --> 17:36.735
Hey, call me as soon
as you get this, okay?

17:37.270 --> 17:39.000
Something happened.

17:42.475 --> 17:45.137
I'll just tell you about it
when you call, okay?

17:46.645 --> 17:48.342
I love you.

18:06.464 --> 18:08.724
<i>- Josh.
- Mattie...</i>

18:09.167 --> 18:10.666
<i>Are you there?</i>

18:10.702 --> 18:13.300
<i>I'm not me anymore.</i>

18:14.038 --> 18:16.371
<i>Something's wrong with me.</i>

18:31.423 --> 18:34.757
<i>I know it's very difficult for us
to talk about loss.</i>

18:34.859 --> 18:37.723
So many conflicting emotions
involved.

18:38.862 --> 18:40.462
This might sound pat to you...

18:40.497 --> 18:42.524
...but it is okay to cry, Mattie.

18:43.066 --> 18:44.457
I have.

18:44.601 --> 18:46.166
You have?

18:48.372 --> 18:50.263
What, five minutes,
is that all I get, Mattie?

18:50.507 --> 18:51.469
I'm wasting your time.

18:51.508 --> 18:53.840
You're not wasting my time.

18:54.077 --> 18:55.472
You're wasting mine.

18:55.512 --> 18:56.736
You're angry.

18:56.880 --> 18:58.372
That's normal.

19:00.350 --> 19:01.947
Actually,
I'm just late for class.

19:02.185 --> 19:04.084
<i>You loved him, didn't you?</i>

19:04.120 --> 19:05.478
And you think it's something
that you did...

19:05.521 --> 19:07.482
...that might've caused this.

19:10.025 --> 19:12.721
The only person I blame...

19:13.061 --> 19:14.751
...is Josh.

19:16.431 --> 19:18.062
You sure about this?

19:23.772 --> 19:25.399
Fuck...

19:26.340 --> 19:27.769
Come on.

19:29.043 --> 19:30.471
Talk.

19:34.282 --> 19:37.142
I don't know why
I didn't see the signs.

19:37.685 --> 19:40.479
I should've been there,
done something.

19:40.755 --> 19:42.583
Sometimes,
there aren't any signs.

19:42.724 --> 19:45.315
This was an intensely lonely
young man.

19:45.660 --> 19:47.060
More than you can ever know.

19:47.095 --> 19:49.622
He was very skilled
at hiding his loneliness.

19:49.964 --> 19:55.091
And when he couldn't hide it
anymore, he hid himself.

19:57.038 --> 19:59.533
Have you ever felt
that kind of loneliness?

20:01.443 --> 20:03.676
Don't worry.
I read your book.

20:03.711 --> 20:06.079
I'm not a suicide risk.

20:06.313 --> 20:09.380
You psych students, you all have a tendency
to resist self-analysis.

20:10.050 --> 20:10.942
Don't.

20:10.985 --> 20:12.382
Don't avoid your fears.

20:12.419 --> 20:13.543
Confront them.

20:13.587 --> 20:15.214
You can keep your emotions down
for a while...

20:15.322 --> 20:17.014
...but somehow, some way,
they will come out...

20:17.057 --> 20:18.419
...and they will be
even more painful...

20:18.425 --> 20:19.788
...and more destructive.

20:19.827 --> 20:21.852
Do you understand that?

20:31.537 --> 20:32.602
Hey.

20:32.639 --> 20:34.368
You good?

20:39.445 --> 20:41.445
Everything's
going to be okay.

21:14.579 --> 21:15.746
<i>It has to be a virus.</i>

21:15.781 --> 21:18.746
I mean, his computer is probably still logged on.
It's just hitting his address book.

21:18.784 --> 21:20.008
They said, "Help me."

21:20.052 --> 21:22.614
Yeah, but viruses always have
some important-sounding shit.

21:22.721 --> 21:24.486
I mean, just the other day,
I got one that said...

21:24.523 --> 21:26.017
"Urgent, Stone. Read me now."

21:26.057 --> 21:27.116
I mean, that's a natural
occurrence.

21:27.224 --> 21:29.590
- It happens all the time...
- That was from me, you idiot.

21:29.627 --> 21:31.395
Damn.
That was pretty strong.

21:31.529 --> 21:34.958
Well, someone should at least
log Josh's computer off.

21:35.099 --> 21:39.336
I'd do it, but I don't want
to go back over there.

21:45.476 --> 21:47.044
All right, I'll go.

21:47.478 --> 21:48.936
Thanks.

25:24.988 --> 25:26.615
<i>There was something
so strange about him...</i>

25:26.657 --> 25:28.282
...when I went over there...

25:28.325 --> 25:30.292
...like he wasn't himself.

25:31.394 --> 25:33.328
But he really wasn't. It...

25:33.363 --> 25:35.761
It was like looking
at a different person.

25:35.899 --> 25:37.490
Why did he do it?

25:37.735 --> 25:39.198
I don't know.

25:40.837 --> 25:43.534
And I think that's
what's driving me crazy...

25:44.174 --> 25:45.840
...that I didn't see it coming.

25:45.876 --> 25:47.475
None of us did, okay?

25:47.511 --> 25:49.645
You know, it's not all on you.

25:52.816 --> 25:54.440
Are you still getting
those messages?

25:54.584 --> 25:58.152
Yeah. What's the deal?
Did Stone not get over there?

25:58.255 --> 26:00.279
You know, he didn't even
show up to class today.

26:00.423 --> 26:02.118
I haven't spoken to him.

26:23.479 --> 26:24.376
Hello?

26:24.413 --> 26:25.812
Hey, Stone.

26:25.848 --> 26:27.645
Hey, Izzie.

26:27.683 --> 26:29.344
It's Mattie.

26:29.885 --> 26:31.419
What's up, Mattie?

26:31.654 --> 26:34.548
Are you still getting
those messages from Josh?

26:34.624 --> 26:36.457
I haven't signed on.

26:36.892 --> 26:39.583
I've just been kind of leaving
my computer alone.

26:39.728 --> 26:43.587
<i>Did you log off Josh's computer?</i>

26:46.134 --> 26:48.626
<i>Did you turn it off?</i>

26:49.870 --> 26:51.696
Are you okay?

26:53.608 --> 26:55.769
<i>I just been kind of down,
you know?</i>

26:56.210 --> 26:57.744
Yeah, I know.

26:57.879 --> 26:59.540
We all are.

27:44.423 --> 27:45.888
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

27:55.334 --> 27:57.329
You here to see the apartment?

27:58.304 --> 28:00.195
Well, take a look.

28:01.240 --> 28:04.469
New paint.
Gonna have new carpet.

28:07.712 --> 28:09.339
You won't beat the rent.

28:13.284 --> 28:15.045
The guy who lived here
was a friend of mine.

28:15.086 --> 28:16.611
I need his computer.

28:17.195 --> 28:18.584
Computer?

28:19.023 --> 28:19.856
What'd you do with it?

28:19.891 --> 28:22.325
I don't know nothing
about no computer.

28:22.861 --> 28:24.153
His computer was
right over there...

28:24.196 --> 28:25.720
...with all the rest of his stuff.

28:25.764 --> 28:27.097
Girl, you better get out
of my face...

28:27.132 --> 28:28.224
...or I'm calling the police.

28:28.266 --> 28:29.723
Why don't I call the police?

28:30.566 --> 28:33.397
All right.
All right! Don't get crazy.

28:35.238 --> 28:36.606
For two months
that boy lived here...

28:36.640 --> 28:38.904
- ...and didn't pay his rent.
- You sold it?!

28:38.943 --> 28:40.638
For two months...
What was I supposed to do?

28:40.678 --> 28:42.240
Who did you sell it to?

28:43.380 --> 28:45.211
Dead cats,
and he done killed himself...

28:45.249 --> 28:46.546
<i>...and here, now, you
come here bugging me...</i>

28:46.584 --> 28:48.146
<i>...about a damn computer.</i>

28:58.294 --> 29:00.321
You tell him he still
owe me a hundred bucks.

29:00.463 --> 29:02.729
<i>The bank didn't take
his raggedy-ass check.</i>

29:10.373 --> 29:11.997
Dexter McCarthy.

29:13.909 --> 29:15.777
- What, it bounced?
- I guess that doesn't really matter...

29:15.812 --> 29:18.073
...since you bought
a stolen computer.

29:18.314 --> 29:20.141
She seemed pretty honest to me.

29:20.283 --> 29:21.573
Why are you e-mailing me?

29:21.618 --> 29:22.710
E-mailing you?

29:22.752 --> 29:24.244
I don't even know who you are.

29:24.387 --> 29:26.616
That computer belonged
to someone I know.

29:26.655 --> 29:28.489
You found his password.
Now you're messing...

29:28.524 --> 29:30.185
...with the people
in his address book?

29:30.225 --> 29:31.887
That's a really shitty
thing to do.

29:31.927 --> 29:33.419
Really?

29:35.831 --> 29:37.156
Come here.

29:44.207 --> 29:45.897
That's not possible.

29:46.242 --> 29:48.338
I have a procrastination
problem.

29:48.478 --> 29:51.038
It hasn't been plugged in...
since you bought it?

29:51.680 --> 29:54.412
No. Look, stolen or not,
the thing cost me 400 bucks.

29:54.449 --> 29:55.473
You want to get me a refund?

29:55.517 --> 29:57.615
Your boyfriend can have
his computer back.

29:57.653 --> 29:59.948
Keep it.
He doesn't need it anymore.

30:00.688 --> 30:02.153
He's dead.

30:06.461 --> 30:07.719
Classic.

31:25.803 --> 31:27.102
What's that?

31:28.673 --> 31:30.070
It's from Josh.

31:30.808 --> 31:33.637
This is his handwriting.

31:33.778 --> 31:35.546
When was it sent?

31:35.580 --> 31:37.112
Seventeenth.

31:37.349 --> 31:39.611
That's two days before he died.

31:55.700 --> 31:58.262
Keeps what out?

31:58.503 --> 32:00.728
He obviously went nuts,
that's all.

32:00.872 --> 32:01.930
What about Stone?

32:01.973 --> 32:03.065
What about him?

32:03.107 --> 32:04.338
Wait, what's up with Stone?

32:04.375 --> 32:05.865
He didn't sound like himself.

32:06.010 --> 32:08.310
I can't explain it.

32:08.646 --> 32:10.337
Kinda got the same feeling.

32:11.081 --> 32:12.846
The same feeling as what?

32:14.818 --> 32:16.916
As when I was at Josh's.

32:21.658 --> 32:23.651
<i>Later on in this broadcast...</i>

32:23.694 --> 32:25.589
<i>...we'll show how
you and your family...</i>

32:25.629 --> 32:27.654
<i>...can stay healthy and germ-free...</i>

32:27.698 --> 32:30.288
<i>...at home and in the workplace.</i>

32:30.633 --> 32:33.033
<i>And here's Skip Warren
with a late-breaking story.</i>

32:33.370 --> 32:35.138
<i>A spokesman
for the County Health Department...</i>

32:35.172 --> 32:37.670
<i>...is calling a recent cluster
of suicides in the city...</i>

32:38.007 --> 32:40.501
<i>..."tragic and very unfortunate"...</i>

32:40.544 --> 32:42.738
<i>...and he added that there's
no evidence to suggest...</i>

32:42.778 --> 32:44.739
<i>...that they are connected
in any way.</i>

32:51.787 --> 32:53.013
It's okay.

32:53.222 --> 32:54.448
Okay.

32:58.293 --> 33:00.491
How well did you
actually know this guy?

33:00.729 --> 33:02.629
- Why?
- 'Cause he was into...

33:02.665 --> 33:04.323
...some scary shit.

33:04.667 --> 33:06.398
Can I show you something?

33:20.914 --> 33:22.743
What are we looking for?

33:23.784 --> 33:25.477
You'll see.

33:28.188 --> 33:29.586
So, your friend...

33:29.624 --> 33:31.185
...was it an accident?

33:32.326 --> 33:33.351
No.

33:33.494 --> 33:35.186
Then what was it?

33:36.764 --> 33:38.699
I'm not sure.

33:45.039 --> 33:48.170
I thought it was just looping the same clips
over and over again, but it's not.

33:48.243 --> 33:49.838
They don't always
do the same thing.

33:49.878 --> 33:52.369
It's some kind of Web-cam feed.

33:54.082 --> 33:56.214
Ah, Bag Man. Watch.

33:56.251 --> 33:57.548
Every time he tries
to take it off...

33:57.685 --> 33:59.812
...the image just cuts... it goes
right back to the beginning.

33:59.854 --> 34:01.512
How did this get on there?

34:01.856 --> 34:04.090
All I did was plug it in.

34:04.425 --> 34:06.250
How long have you been
watching this?

34:06.594 --> 34:08.283
No, I think the question is...

34:08.328 --> 34:10.353
...how long have they
been watching me?

34:17.637 --> 34:18.931
Damn it.

34:22.042 --> 34:23.534
<i>Yeah?</i>

34:24.377 --> 34:26.043
<i>Look, look, man...</i>

34:28.748 --> 34:30.949
Turn it off. Turn it off!

34:31.684 --> 34:33.079
Turn it off.

34:33.719 --> 34:35.119
I can't believe
you showed me that.

34:35.353 --> 34:37.215
It was your friend's computer.

34:37.891 --> 34:39.360
Did he get off on the stuff?

34:39.460 --> 34:41.460
Was he shooting those videos
and selling them on-line?

34:41.494 --> 34:42.391
What was he doing?

34:42.428 --> 34:44.553
Josh tied a phone cord
around his neck...

34:44.697 --> 34:47.456
...and hanged himself.
That's what he was doing.

34:48.400 --> 34:51.331
Mattie... Mattie,
don't you think...

34:51.370 --> 34:53.496
...that your friend having
the video feeds...

34:53.538 --> 34:56.335
...and then doing what he did
is not a coincidence?

34:56.574 --> 34:57.965
And if those people...

34:58.010 --> 35:00.201
...if what they're doing,
if it's real...

35:00.346 --> 35:03.180
- ...if they're all dead...
- You know what I think?

35:04.516 --> 35:07.080
I think, no matter what...

35:07.318 --> 35:09.479
...Josh is still gonna be gone.

35:10.521 --> 35:13.519
I think you need to go back upstairs
and erase his hard drive.

35:13.625 --> 35:14.519
I tried.

35:14.559 --> 35:16.183
It won't let me.

35:19.163 --> 35:21.195
I need to move on.

35:21.533 --> 35:23.033
I'm sorry.

35:26.905 --> 35:29.204
Don't you want to know why?

36:37.372 --> 36:38.800
<i>Hello, this is Louise Webber.</i>

36:38.840 --> 36:40.937
<i>Leave your name and message
and I'll get back...</i>

37:42.068 --> 37:43.563
Josh?

37:43.803 --> 37:45.928
Josh, it's Mattie.

37:46.873 --> 37:48.433
<i>Mattie.</i>

37:48.976 --> 37:50.503
Are you there?

37:51.244 --> 37:53.569
<i>I feel all alone.</i>

37:53.613 --> 37:55.139
Josh?

38:01.821 --> 38:02.988
Josh.

38:03.022 --> 38:05.117
<i>Something is wrong with me.</i>

38:51.402 --> 38:52.935
<i>I have seen two people...</i>

38:53.070 --> 38:54.394
...kill themselves.

38:54.439 --> 38:58.439
My psych professor stepped out
in front of a moving bus.

38:58.576 --> 39:00.068
All in the last week.

39:00.144 --> 39:02.435
Have you walked
around campus lately?

39:02.480 --> 39:04.345
Every classroom is half-empty...

39:04.382 --> 39:07.242
...and no one is talking
about it.

39:08.285 --> 39:10.318
Something is following me.

39:10.987 --> 39:12.755
It's in my dreams.

39:13.290 --> 39:14.454
I saw it on the bus.

39:14.492 --> 39:18.221
Come on, Mattie. Do you honestly feel there are
ghosts of some kind walking around out there?

39:18.262 --> 39:19.991
I don't know.

39:20.330 --> 39:22.289
But something is wrong.

39:23.400 --> 39:26.594
You're a very smart young woman.
I want you to add this up for me.

39:27.203 --> 39:28.837
A flu epidemic breaks out.

39:28.905 --> 39:31.601
People are in a weakened state.
They're fearful of each other.

39:31.742 --> 39:33.537
And then add a trigger event:

39:33.677 --> 39:36.878
this coincidental clustering
of suicides.

39:37.213 --> 39:39.178
The e-mail rumor mill
goes into overdrive...

39:39.215 --> 39:41.707
...and suddenly people are seeing
strange things in the shadows?

39:41.752 --> 39:43.219
I'm not imagining this!

39:43.253 --> 39:45.787
Why do you think
you came here again?

39:45.921 --> 39:48.188
It certainly isn't because you thought
that I would agree with you.

39:48.224 --> 39:51.449
You knew what my response would be.
You knew that you needed to hear it.

39:51.660 --> 39:54.484
You can't articulate what you think
is going on out there, Mattie...

39:54.597 --> 39:57.157
...because it isn't real.

40:01.303 --> 40:04.867
So what am I supposed to do?

40:05.207 --> 40:08.374
- Just ignore everything I'm feeling?
- No. No.

40:08.477 --> 40:10.575
You have to face what you
think is happening out there.

40:10.613 --> 40:13.171
You have to stand ground,
take a good, long look...

40:14.014 --> 40:16.848
...and you'll see it's not there.

43:00.137 --> 43:01.900
You're not real.

43:02.411 --> 43:04.209
You're not real.

43:21.731 --> 43:23.125
Stone?

43:45.887 --> 43:48.187
- I don't want to die!
- Stone...

43:48.390 --> 43:50.688
I don't want to do it myself.

43:51.293 --> 43:53.957
I don't want to die!

43:54.896 --> 43:57.088
- Stone! What's happening!
- I don't want to die!

43:57.132 --> 43:59.559
I don't want to do it myself!

43:59.700 --> 44:01.292
Stone!

47:30.187 --> 47:31.851
Oh, my God!

47:45.953 --> 47:47.786
I'm ready to know.

47:48.921 --> 47:50.252
What did you find?

47:50.389 --> 47:51.520
Well, his hard drive was fried...

47:51.558 --> 47:54.521
...but I was able to retrieve
most of the shit off of it.

47:54.661 --> 47:57.493
Apparently your boy's into stockpiling
some pretty serious viruses.

47:57.631 --> 47:58.663
Why would he do that?

47:58.699 --> 48:00.066
It's a power trip.

48:00.734 --> 48:02.797
It's like keeping nukes
in your closet.

48:02.936 --> 48:04.431
I found some other stuff that...

48:04.471 --> 48:05.968
...I think you need to see.

48:06.206 --> 48:09.542
When I booted the drive,
this is what came up.

48:12.845 --> 48:13.612
Josh?

48:13.646 --> 48:15.743
<i>This message is
for Douglas Zeigler.</i>

48:15.782 --> 48:18.749
<i>I'm Josh Ockmann, I'm the guy
who hacked into your system.</i>

48:18.884 --> 48:22.944
<i>I'm sorry...
but now I got to talk to you.</i>

48:23.989 --> 48:25.957
He kept a video diary?

48:26.091 --> 48:27.922
It's more like a play-by-play.

48:28.060 --> 48:30.288
<i>Zeigler, it's Josh again.</i>

48:30.429 --> 48:33.164
<i>How can I convince you
to talk to me?</i>

48:33.299 --> 48:35.467
<i>Whatever you had locked up
in your system...</i>

48:35.601 --> 48:37.128
<i>...I let it loose.</i>

48:37.303 --> 48:38.529
<i>I let...</i>

48:38.670 --> 48:40.562
<i>And now I don't know
how to stop it.</i>

48:40.805 --> 48:42.396
You okay with this?

48:42.840 --> 48:44.308
Yeah.

48:46.111 --> 48:48.245
<i>I need to know
what you had in there.</i>

48:48.379 --> 48:49.441
<i>I need to know.</i>

48:49.481 --> 48:51.042
<i>I've never seen
anything like it...</i>

48:51.182 --> 48:52.711
<i>...but it's burning
through every firewall...</i>

48:52.751 --> 48:54.316
<i>...it's frying every circuit.</i>

48:54.452 --> 48:56.085
<i>I need your help.</i>

48:56.655 --> 48:58.748
I bookmarked the rest.

48:59.257 --> 49:00.952
<i>Zeig, I got your e-mail.</i>

49:01.092 --> 49:03.117
<i>I think I figured out
a way to stop it.</i>

49:03.161 --> 49:05.527
<i>I'm writing a virus
that could shut it down.</i>

49:05.663 --> 49:08.324
<i>Meet me at the library
at 5:00 today.</i>

49:11.001 --> 49:12.826
Check this one out.

49:13.570 --> 49:15.697
<i>I saw something in the library.</i>

49:15.939 --> 49:17.898
<i>I can still feel it.</i>

49:18.141 --> 49:20.139
<i>Like it reached inside of me.</i>

49:20.277 --> 49:22.876
<i>Like it took something
out of me.</i>

49:23.814 --> 49:25.081
<i>My life.</i>

49:25.115 --> 49:26.778
<i>Why won't you answer me, Zeig?</i>

49:26.817 --> 49:28.714
<i>I need your help.</i>

49:28.952 --> 49:32.115
<i>Goddamn it,
why didn't you warn me?</i>

49:33.723 --> 49:35.320
Is that it?

49:35.759 --> 49:37.155
There's one more.

49:37.292 --> 49:38.718
But...

49:39.196 --> 49:40.888
I want to see it.

49:42.698 --> 49:45.266
<i>It's breaking me down.</i>

49:45.502 --> 49:47.866
<i>I feel like
there's nothing left of me.</i>

49:48.005 --> 49:51.266
<i>I can't think, I can't move.</i>

49:51.608 --> 49:54.172
<i>I can't take the pain.</i>

49:54.411 --> 49:56.411
<i>I just can't.</i>

49:56.547 --> 49:58.674
<i>I'm not even me anymore.</i>

49:58.916 --> 50:00.249
<i>It's all gone.</i>

50:00.284 --> 50:03.076
<i>I... can't go on.</i>

50:07.289 --> 50:09.180
<i>I'm sorry, Mattie.</i>

50:11.627 --> 50:13.725
<i>I'm so sorry, Mattie.</i>

50:24.073 --> 50:26.138
What if it's all connected?

50:26.375 --> 50:28.307
- What?
- The suicides...

50:28.344 --> 50:30.706
...the... Internet people,
the things I saw.

50:30.846 --> 50:32.572
The ghosts?

50:32.814 --> 50:34.079
I'm not buying it, Mattie.

50:34.116 --> 50:36.646
Josh thought he saw them...

50:37.285 --> 50:39.884
...and it messed him up
so bad, he...

50:41.856 --> 50:43.587
...he did what he did.

50:45.693 --> 50:47.987
Okay, what do you think
drove him over the edge?

50:48.030 --> 50:49.898
Josh had some pretty
bad shit going on.

50:49.932 --> 50:52.860
Josh wasn't on a power trip
with viruses.

50:53.401 --> 50:55.363
He saw something horrible...

50:55.404 --> 50:56.803
...something like this...

50:56.838 --> 50:59.668
...and he wanted to stop it.

51:00.107 --> 51:02.375
Hackers do this stuff
all the time.

51:03.009 --> 51:04.876
It's a prank.

51:05.612 --> 51:07.378
He got it off the Internet.
Come on.

51:07.415 --> 51:08.839
But it wasn't hooked up
to the Internet.

51:08.883 --> 51:11.214
- The cable was unplugged.
- So?

51:11.551 --> 51:13.178
It came through the Wi-Fi.

51:13.220 --> 51:15.955
Just like Josh said,
he pulled something through...

51:15.990 --> 51:18.686
Pulled ghosts through the Wi-Fi?

51:19.426 --> 51:21.194
It just doesn't make any sense.

51:21.228 --> 51:23.726
It makes all the sense
in the world.

51:24.064 --> 51:27.622
Do you have any idea
of the amount of data...

51:27.768 --> 51:29.067
...that's floating out there?

51:29.102 --> 51:30.767
The amount of information...

51:30.804 --> 51:32.132
...we just beam into the air?

51:32.172 --> 51:36.730
We broadcast to everyone where we are,
and we think we're safe?

51:36.876 --> 51:39.810
The whole freakin' city
is going insane...

51:39.914 --> 51:42.348
<i>...and we're acting like
it's nothing.</i>

51:42.483 --> 51:44.214
Well, it's not nothing.

51:44.251 --> 51:47.118
It's something
we don't understand...

51:47.154 --> 51:49.279
<i>...and it is coming for us.</i>

51:49.323 --> 51:51.591
<i>You're freaking us out, man.</i>

51:51.926 --> 51:54.316
It's the end of the world.

51:54.760 --> 51:56.850
That's what it is.

51:59.765 --> 52:01.432
Maybe it's the booze
in your coffee.

52:05.203 --> 52:06.734
What about Zeigler?

52:06.771 --> 52:08.498
This whole thing
started with him.

52:08.840 --> 52:10.503
He was one of Josh's
hacker friends.

52:10.541 --> 52:13.570
There's got to be someone at school
who knows how we can find him.

52:13.878 --> 52:16.773
Maybe he knows
what the hell is going on.

52:41.038 --> 52:42.765
<i>Computer virus...</i>

52:42.807 --> 52:44.905
<i>...is affecting Internet service
worldwide.</i>

52:45.243 --> 52:48.434
<i>Authorities are requesting those of you
who do not need to use your computers...</i>

52:48.535 --> 52:49.835
<i>...to shut them down now...</i>

52:49.880 --> 52:51.911
<i>...to avoid spreading the bug.</i>

53:32.754 --> 53:34.044
Hey.

53:39.763 --> 53:42.256
I'm starting to think
I'm the only one living here.

53:45.402 --> 53:47.830
Is there anything
going on tonight?

53:48.171 --> 53:51.003
I don't really go out much.
Sorry.

53:55.544 --> 53:57.174
Bitch.

55:32.271 --> 55:33.961
"Douglas Zeigler."

55:36.242 --> 55:38.441
<i>Zeigler, the virus is inside...</i>

55:38.478 --> 55:39.804
<i>Inside... inside...</i>

55:49.138 --> 55:50.730
Inside?

55:58.430 --> 55:59.929
Are you saying...

56:51.781 --> 56:57.373
<i>...but we are receiving reports of...
mass disappearances in other cities, as well.</i>

56:57.553 --> 56:59.981
<i>By all accounts, the crisis
appears to be spreading...</i>

57:00.022 --> 57:02.447
<i>...and the federal government
is mobilizing a response...</i>

57:02.491 --> 57:04.586
<i>...as more and more law enforcement...</i>

57:04.693 --> 57:06.892
<i>...and emergency systems
appear to be...</i>

57:06.927 --> 57:08.587
<i>...simply shutting dow...</i>

57:49.136 --> 57:51.471
<i>I just wanted
to see you, Mattie.</i>

57:51.706 --> 57:52.734
Tim?

57:52.874 --> 57:55.272
<i>I just wanted to see you.</i>

57:56.310 --> 57:58.245
How are you doing this?

57:58.380 --> 58:00.009
<i>I see you.</i>

58:06.986 --> 58:08.620
Izzie, are you in there?

58:37.517 --> 58:38.415
<i>This voice mail is no longer...</i>

58:38.426 --> 58:39.926
Hey, I'm looking for Izzie.

58:39.953 --> 58:41.586
<i>...accepting incoming messages.</i>

58:41.621 --> 58:43.120
<i>Please try again later.</i>

58:43.222 --> 58:44.819
<i>Message 687.</i>

59:00.605 --> 59:02.136
Isabelle?

59:16.954 --> 59:19.815
Come here. Come here.

59:28.665 --> 59:30.199
You'll be okay.

59:45.016 --> 59:47.608
You know what dying tastes like?

59:50.355 --> 59:52.387
Metal.

59:52.924 --> 59:55.016
You don't want to breathe.

59:55.359 --> 59:57.487
Because every time, it's...

59:59.763 --> 01:00:02.963
...it's more of it inside you.

01:00:03.900 --> 01:00:07.968
I want to die but I'm
too afraid to do it.

01:00:08.204 --> 01:00:09.938
You're not gonna die.

01:00:11.808 --> 01:00:13.735
I want to.

01:00:14.777 --> 01:00:16.478
What do they want?

01:00:16.713 --> 01:00:19.905
They want what they
don't have anymore.

01:00:21.483 --> 01:00:23.110
They want life.

01:00:25.153 --> 01:00:27.285
They're coming for you, too.

01:00:29.924 --> 01:00:31.984
There's nothing
you can do about it.

01:00:32.527 --> 01:00:35.225
God, you're freezing.

01:00:36.265 --> 01:00:38.126
Wait... here a second.

01:00:44.640 --> 01:00:46.664
<i>You have reached 911 emergency.</i>

01:00:46.908 --> 01:00:48.973
<i>Sorry, all operators are busy.</i>

01:00:49.010 --> 01:00:52.501
<i>Please stay on the line
for the next available operator.</i>

01:00:58.385 --> 01:01:00.076
I'm sorry, Mattie.

01:01:04.292 --> 01:01:06.554
Izzie!

01:01:23.476 --> 01:01:25.339
<i>- Hello. This is Louise Webber.
- Hello?</i>

01:01:25.412 --> 01:01:27.146
<i>- Leave your name and message...
- Damn it!</i>

01:01:32.852 --> 01:01:33.717
Mattie!

01:01:33.753 --> 01:01:35.977
Dexter, Isabelle's gone.

01:01:36.323 --> 01:01:37.415
What do you mean she's gone?

01:01:37.457 --> 01:01:39.722
I'm packing a bag.
I'll meet you out front.

01:01:39.760 --> 01:01:41.291
I'm on my way.

01:02:24.002 --> 01:02:27.598
She was just standing there,
empty...

01:02:28.040 --> 01:02:29.740
...like she wanted to die.

01:02:29.975 --> 01:02:31.833
And she was just nothing.

01:02:33.212 --> 01:02:35.307
Just... ash, just this...

01:02:35.647 --> 01:02:37.636
<i>Mattie, look at me.</i>

01:02:37.817 --> 01:02:41.479
I saw it... the thing Josh was
talking about, it came for me.

01:02:41.920 --> 01:02:43.487
- Right after I found this.
- What?

01:02:43.521 --> 01:02:45.018
The virus Josh was working on.

01:02:45.056 --> 01:02:47.349
I found it taped
inside of his computer case.

01:02:47.692 --> 01:02:49.817
Off-line, where they
couldn't get to it.

01:02:51.262 --> 01:02:52.954
- Will it work?
- I don't know.

01:02:52.997 --> 01:02:54.696
But Zeigler will.

01:02:55.432 --> 01:02:56.860
You found Zeigler?

01:02:56.901 --> 01:02:58.459
We're gonna get some answers.

01:02:58.503 --> 01:03:00.003
Yeah.

01:03:00.838 --> 01:03:02.838
We're gonna shut it down.

01:03:04.642 --> 01:03:06.733
We're gonna shut it down.

01:03:26.762 --> 01:03:29.028
Mattie... Mattie...

01:03:29.366 --> 01:03:30.792
You all right?

01:03:30.934 --> 01:03:32.359
<i>Yeah.</i>

01:03:35.938 --> 01:03:38.466
Get out of the car.

01:03:51.521 --> 01:03:53.146
<i>Is he all right?</i>

01:03:53.290 --> 01:03:55.451
- Let's go.
- What?!

01:03:55.892 --> 01:03:57.426
Come on.

01:03:58.661 --> 01:03:59.629
There's nobody in the car?

01:03:59.663 --> 01:04:01.060
No.

01:04:01.398 --> 01:04:04.332
Come on. Come on.

01:04:28.155 --> 01:04:29.845
- Don't you move!
- What the f...

01:04:29.891 --> 01:04:31.280
- Don't come any closer!
- Don't shoot!

01:04:31.326 --> 01:04:33.694
Put the gun down!
Calvin, are you crazy?

01:04:33.728 --> 01:04:35.553
They're safe, they're not...
they're just kids!

01:04:35.597 --> 01:04:36.993
We're not going to hurt you.

01:04:36.830 --> 01:04:38.525
Put it down.

01:04:38.965 --> 01:04:40.432
We've got to keep moving.

01:04:40.600 --> 01:04:41.692
We're wasting time.

01:04:41.735 --> 01:04:43.330
We've got to get out
of the city!

01:04:43.370 --> 01:04:45.228
They came through the computer.

01:04:44.371 --> 01:04:46.163
We saw them.

01:04:46.406 --> 01:04:47.799
We think we have a solution.

01:04:47.841 --> 01:04:49.335
Are you people insane?

01:04:49.443 --> 01:04:50.934
You stay here, you're dead.

01:04:50.978 --> 01:04:53.039
We shouldn't be out here...
they say it's spreading.

01:04:53.080 --> 01:04:55.277
They say that they don't know how long
until it's everywhere.

01:04:55.382 --> 01:04:56.406
The cops are gone!

01:04:56.450 --> 01:04:57.940
People are dying
all over the place! Come on!

01:04:57.985 --> 01:04:59.516
We heard it's safe
in the dead zones.

01:04:59.553 --> 01:05:02.613
Anywhere there's no computers,
no phones, no Wi-Fi.

01:05:02.790 --> 01:05:04.848
Anywhere where they
can't come through.

01:05:04.891 --> 01:05:06.954
- Let's go!
- Save yourselves!

01:05:07.393 --> 01:05:08.927
<i>Hurry!</i>

01:05:17.102 --> 01:05:19.166
What if they got Zeigler?

01:05:19.305 --> 01:05:20.302
CWhat if we can't get out?

01:05:20.306 --> 01:05:22.403
He's alive!

01:05:24.143 --> 01:05:25.739
He's got to be.

01:06:01.045 --> 01:06:02.843
Douglas Zeigler?

01:06:02.881 --> 01:06:04.239
Zeigler!

01:06:11.656 --> 01:06:13.023
My God.

01:06:26.304 --> 01:06:27.935
He's not here.

01:06:29.373 --> 01:06:31.872
No! You're going
to let them in!

01:06:35.546 --> 01:06:38.438
- Who are you?!
- My friend Josh needed to see you. Why?

01:06:38.649 --> 01:06:40.610
That's the little prick
who let them in.

01:06:40.651 --> 01:06:41.583
Let what in?

01:06:41.619 --> 01:06:44.544
The slightest leak,
the slightest hole...

01:06:44.588 --> 01:06:46.083
...that's how.

01:06:46.123 --> 01:06:47.891
<i>We need to know
what you were working on.</i>

01:06:47.925 --> 01:06:49.017
What was it?!

01:06:49.060 --> 01:06:51.651
It was a telecom project!

01:06:51.695 --> 01:06:53.160
It was my baby.

01:06:53.197 --> 01:06:55.065
It was super-wide band.

01:06:55.199 --> 01:06:57.899
We found frequencies that we
didn't even know existed...

01:06:57.934 --> 01:06:59.467
...and they came through.

01:06:59.502 --> 01:07:01.302
Who did?

01:07:07.242 --> 01:07:08.567
We didn't know
what it was at first.

01:07:08.611 --> 01:07:11.247
<i>We thought it was
like a radio wave interference.</i>

01:07:11.281 --> 01:07:13.849
Then, we realized
that there was a pattern to it.

01:07:14.684 --> 01:07:16.274
Every time that we'd try
to monitor them...

01:07:16.319 --> 01:07:18.450
...they would stop, or they
would change frequencies.

01:07:18.488 --> 01:07:20.347
I mean, they were smart.

01:07:20.390 --> 01:07:23.357
<i>They were reacting to us,
and then...</i>

01:07:23.493 --> 01:07:27.985
<i>...we started seeing things
around the lab.</i>

01:07:28.429 --> 01:07:30.259
<i>But shadows can't hide
underneath the desk.</i>

01:07:30.298 --> 01:07:34.022
<i>Shadows can't walk
across a room in broad daylight.</i>

01:07:34.569 --> 01:07:37.201
There was this tape.

01:07:38.440 --> 01:07:40.099
Red utility tape.

01:07:40.242 --> 01:07:41.934
Have you seen it?

01:07:43.880 --> 01:07:45.407
It must have blocked
part of the spectrum...

01:07:45.448 --> 01:07:46.813
...that they needed
for transmissions...

01:07:46.917 --> 01:07:48.407
...so we could keep them
out of a room...

01:07:48.451 --> 01:07:49.779
...but we couldn't keep them out.

01:07:49.819 --> 01:07:51.780
I mean, they were coming through
so fast...

01:07:51.821 --> 01:07:53.778
...it was like a blur.

01:07:54.823 --> 01:07:58.087
The last thing you want,
the last thing you ever want...

01:07:58.326 --> 01:07:59.958
...is for them to get to you.

01:08:00.095 --> 01:08:04.359
'Cause when they grab ahold,
they take your will to live.

01:08:04.399 --> 01:08:07.530
Everything that made you is gone.

01:08:07.836 --> 01:08:09.033
You don't want to talk...

01:08:09.071 --> 01:08:10.268
...you don't want to move.

01:08:10.305 --> 01:08:13.106
You're a shell.

01:08:13.442 --> 01:08:14.905
And then come the bruises.

01:08:14.943 --> 01:08:16.433
They spread all over.

01:08:16.478 --> 01:08:18.968
Your body dies
right out from under you...

01:08:19.180 --> 01:08:22.506
...and the next thing you know,
you're just a pile of ash!

01:08:22.649 --> 01:08:24.939
I saw it happen to Tillman.

01:08:25.184 --> 01:08:27.883
I saw it happen to Plummer.

01:08:28.087 --> 01:08:29.145
What are they?

01:08:29.189 --> 01:08:30.850
I wish I knew.

01:08:31.590 --> 01:08:34.358
I just watched
my best friends die, Zeigler.

01:08:34.394 --> 01:08:36.354
That's not the answer
I came here for.

01:08:36.563 --> 01:08:38.626
Well, what do you want me
to say?

01:08:40.167 --> 01:08:42.462
They've already crawled in
the entire regional network.

01:08:42.502 --> 01:08:44.192
Everywhere...
cellphones, Pads...

01:08:44.237 --> 01:08:45.736
We can't stop them.

01:08:45.772 --> 01:08:47.198
<i>We have to crash
the entire system.</i>

01:08:47.240 --> 01:08:49.437
<i>How are we supposed
to crash the system?</i>

01:08:50.175 --> 01:08:52.372
This is what Josh
was working on.

01:08:52.511 --> 01:08:55.205
A virus, configured
to the specs of your system.

01:08:57.448 --> 01:08:59.081
Where's your server?

01:09:00.318 --> 01:09:02.178
In a highly non-optimum place.

01:09:02.220 --> 01:09:03.317
Where is it?!

01:09:03.354 --> 01:09:05.354
It's in the basement,
in the computer lab!

01:09:05.390 --> 01:09:08.015
It doesn't matter,
because even if you upload it...

01:09:08.260 --> 01:09:11.093
...it still doesn't mean
that it's going to work!

01:09:13.130 --> 01:09:15.464
No, no, no!

01:09:15.701 --> 01:09:16.961
<i>No!</i>

01:10:10.521 --> 01:10:11.747
Run!

01:10:14.057 --> 01:10:15.485
Go!

01:10:24.500 --> 01:10:25.828
Come on!

01:10:29.373 --> 01:10:30.731
Dexter!

01:10:31.274 --> 01:10:32.673
Go!

01:14:00.009 --> 01:14:01.376
<i>Mattie.</i>

01:14:07.183 --> 01:14:08.774
Josh?

01:14:11.955 --> 01:14:13.185
Josh?

01:14:16.159 --> 01:14:17.785
<i>I'm sorry, Mattie.</i>

01:14:39.981 --> 01:14:41.514
No, don't look!

01:14:41.549 --> 01:14:43.114
Just run!

01:14:48.890 --> 01:14:50.590
Mattie! Mattie!

01:14:50.726 --> 01:14:51.893
Come back to me.

01:14:52.327 --> 01:14:53.522
I saw it, Dex.

01:14:53.562 --> 01:14:54.629
I saw...

01:14:54.663 --> 01:14:56.120
Okay. Stay right here.

01:14:56.230 --> 01:14:57.921
I'll be right back.
I'll be right back.

01:14:57.965 --> 01:14:59.225
No!

01:14:59.367 --> 01:15:01.561
- I have to.
- It's too late. There's nothing we can do.

01:15:01.636 --> 01:15:02.967
I can still shut the system down.

01:15:03.004 --> 01:15:04.599
Don't you get it?

01:15:04.739 --> 01:15:06.707
There's no system to shut down.

01:15:06.741 --> 01:15:07.708
They are the system.

01:15:07.742 --> 01:15:08.831
I have to go.

01:15:08.976 --> 01:15:10.867
No... no...

01:16:18.811 --> 01:16:20.401
It worked.

01:16:47.371 --> 01:16:49.004
Let's get the hell
out of here! Come on!

01:16:49.206 --> 01:16:51.466
Come on! Run!

01:18:18.326 --> 01:18:20.351
How much gas do we have left?

01:18:20.395 --> 01:18:22.053
Half a tank.

01:18:22.230 --> 01:18:24.098
How far is that gonna get us?

01:18:26.034 --> 01:18:28.034
We're gonna find out.

01:19:38.703 --> 01:19:40.296
<i>This is an emergency message...</i>

01:19:40.339 --> 01:19:42.068
<i>...from the United States Army.</i>

01:19:42.141 --> 01:19:43.403
<i>Search and rescue units...</i>

01:19:43.442 --> 01:19:46.206
<i>...have been dispatched to assist
survivors of the crisis.</i>

01:19:46.345 --> 01:19:47.769
<i>We have established safe zones...</i>

01:19:47.813 --> 01:19:50.206
<i>...in locations without wireless
or cellphone coverage.</i>

01:19:50.249 --> 01:19:51.974
<i>Cellphones, computers...</i>

01:19:52.018 --> 01:19:54.987
<i>...and Pads are all conduits
for the invasion.</i>

01:19:55.021 --> 01:19:58.588
<i>Dispose of all technology before
proceeding to these locations.</i>

01:20:32.989 --> 01:20:34.483
<i>Hold on, Mattie!</i>

01:21:09.891 --> 01:21:10.858
You all right?

01:21:10.892 --> 01:21:12.750
Yeah. What happened?

01:21:12.794 --> 01:21:14.283
I don't know.

01:21:23.955 --> 01:21:26.080
We must've hit a dead zone.

01:21:27.942 --> 01:21:30.436
They can't exist without a signal.

01:22:09.317 --> 01:22:11.182
<i>We can never go back.</i>

01:22:11.218 --> 01:22:13.416
<i>The cities are theirs.</i>

01:22:13.454 --> 01:22:16.353
<i>Our lives are different now.</i>

01:22:16.991 --> 01:22:19.783
<i>What was meant to connect us
to one another...</i>

01:22:20.027 --> 01:22:21.986
<i>...instead connected us to forces...</i>

01:22:22.096 --> 01:22:24.387
<i>...that we could've
never imagined.</i>

01:22:28.601 --> 01:22:31.664
<i>The world we knew is gone.</i>

01:22:31.805 --> 01:22:35.236
<i>But the will to live
never dies.</i>

01:22:35.675 --> 01:22:38.211
<i>Not for us...</i>

01:22:39.112 --> 01:22:41.146
<i>...and not for them.</i>

01:22:42.305 --> 01:22:48.169
