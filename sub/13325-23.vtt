WEBVTT

00:03.103 --> 00:06.038
I think the frequency
of our sexual encounters

00:06.040 --> 00:07.506
Leveled off around

00:07.508 --> 00:09.241
<i>The sixth year</i>
<i>of marriage.</i>

00:09.243 --> 00:12.011
Otherwise,
it was a pretty good
year for me.

00:12.013 --> 00:14.046
- I was...
- Who cares?!

00:14.048 --> 00:16.515
I don't care!
Who cares?!

00:16.517 --> 00:18.751
Charlie, turn this off
before we die.

00:18.753 --> 00:21.520
Or would it
be more exciting

00:21.522 --> 00:23.722
If we were listening...

00:25.091 --> 00:27.426
To the sex life
of hitler?

00:28.661 --> 00:31.130
Or, even scarier...

00:32.632 --> 00:34.600
Pirate hitler.

00:34.602 --> 00:37.136
Ruler of the third reich
from the seven seas.

00:38.638 --> 00:41.707
But still
fun at parties.

00:43.743 --> 00:46.445
And you thought we wouldn't
be able to work together.

00:46.447 --> 00:49.348
Maybe we should change
the whole research project
to computer doodling.

00:50.350 --> 00:52.351
Could talk about it
over dinner.

00:52.353 --> 00:54.386
That's a dangerous
road, charlie.

00:54.388 --> 00:55.821
The road's
not that dangerous,

00:55.823 --> 00:57.823
I used to drive that road
all the time.

00:57.825 --> 00:59.591
No, no, no, no, no.

00:59.593 --> 01:02.528
That's why I got an attack dog.
For people like you.

01:02.530 --> 01:04.329
Sic him, rex.
Sic him.

01:06.066 --> 01:08.133
In three years,
when he's trained to do
that sort of thing,

01:08.135 --> 01:09.701
You'll be sorry.

01:09.703 --> 01:11.070
So you decided to keep him?

01:11.072 --> 01:12.771
No, I'm taking him
back to the breeder.

01:12.773 --> 01:15.774
It's too much work
and they're so emotional.

01:15.776 --> 01:17.843
Everything is like
the greatest thing
they've ever seen.

01:17.845 --> 01:20.846
A dirty tennis ball
is like a double rainbow.

01:20.848 --> 01:23.082
Don't worry about
robot girl, rex.

01:23.084 --> 01:25.284
One day a human
will adopt you.

01:25.286 --> 01:26.852
If you like him so much,

01:26.854 --> 01:29.788
Why don't you
take him for a walk?

01:29.790 --> 01:32.224
I'd love to,
but I gotta get home
and pack.

01:34.128 --> 01:38.764
For the first time,
they've made it 30 days
without an anger incident.

01:38.766 --> 01:41.500
Oh, so you're
rewarding them
for the healthy thing

01:41.502 --> 01:43.435
They're supposed to be
doing in the first place.

01:43.437 --> 01:46.505
That's like rewarding rex
for laying there.

01:46.507 --> 01:48.373
God, he's so much work.

01:49.742 --> 01:51.777
It's not about the trip,
it's about the milestone.

01:51.779 --> 01:54.413
They deserve to be rewarded
for making it 30 days.

01:54.415 --> 01:56.849
Although, as of tomorrow,
it'll only be 29.

01:56.851 --> 02:00.486
Mm. Pardon robot girl
for being dubious,

02:00.488 --> 02:03.122
But on the last day
of your no-anger marathon,

02:03.124 --> 02:05.624
You're going to take
your anger group
to an airport.

02:05.626 --> 02:09.428
In my clinical opinion,
you're stupid.

02:09.430 --> 02:11.230
Ah, you may think that,

02:11.232 --> 02:12.865
But wait till you hear
my reasoning.

02:12.867 --> 02:14.800
When I bought
the tickets online,

02:14.802 --> 02:17.369
I put in the wrong day.

02:18.671 --> 02:20.739
<i>( theme music playing )</i>

02:23.409 --> 02:26.678
Okay, so leave this
light here on all night,
stack the mail right here,

02:26.680 --> 02:29.681
And, if you can, try to figure
out who's been stealing my
"sports illustrateds."

02:29.683 --> 02:31.150
I didn't get
the last four issues.

02:31.152 --> 02:34.686
Two issues.
I'll keep an eye out.

02:34.688 --> 02:36.822
Dad, I'm 16 years old,

02:36.824 --> 02:39.158
Why don't you
just let me stay home
alone while you're gone?

02:39.160 --> 02:40.526
Good idea.

02:40.528 --> 02:42.261
Michael, you don't
have to check in.

02:42.263 --> 02:43.829
Remember, sweetheart,
if someone breaks in,

02:43.831 --> 02:45.831
Just hide under a bed,
in a closet.

02:45.833 --> 02:48.267
It won't work,
but it'll make you feel
like you did something.

02:49.569 --> 02:51.270
If you think
that's going to work...

02:51.272 --> 02:53.472
You're right,
let michael die.

02:56.376 --> 02:58.477
Don't worry
about the house,
I got it.

02:58.479 --> 03:00.579
And do yourself a favor,
while you're in tahoe,

03:00.581 --> 03:02.881
Just forget about kate.
Have fun.

03:02.883 --> 03:05.951
I can't forget
about kate.

03:05.953 --> 03:07.753
Besides, for the first time
in a long time,

03:07.755 --> 03:08.954
We're enjoying
each other's company.

03:08.956 --> 03:10.622
I actually think
she's gonna miss me.

03:10.624 --> 03:12.758
Well, it happens, charlie.

03:12.760 --> 03:15.861
When I don't see you
for a couple of days,
things are a little off.

03:15.863 --> 03:17.563
The sun
isn't quite as bright.

03:17.565 --> 03:19.264
The flowers
don't smell as sweet.

03:19.266 --> 03:20.766
I still want my
"sports illustrateds" back.

03:20.768 --> 03:23.402
Fine.
Cheap son of a bitch.

03:27.440 --> 03:29.908
Lacey, you do know
it's 45 degrees in tahoe?

03:29.910 --> 03:32.878
I know, but this will get
me into the vip security
line at the airport.

03:32.880 --> 03:35.948
I am not
looking forward
to this.

03:35.950 --> 03:38.450
I hate flying.
It is so exhausting.

03:38.452 --> 03:40.452
The only thing
I can't stand is those

03:40.454 --> 03:43.822
Tambourine-banging,
bald-headed hare krishnas

03:43.824 --> 03:47.226
All over the airport
throwing their religion
in my face.

03:47.228 --> 03:49.561
Relax, ed, you don't
have to worry about the
hare krishnas anymore.

03:49.563 --> 03:51.697
They've been replaced
by terrorists.

03:51.699 --> 03:54.633
And by terrorists
he means the people
working at security.

03:55.735 --> 03:58.937
But once you get
on the airplane,
I love it.

03:58.939 --> 04:00.772
I mean,
visiting the cockpit,

04:00.774 --> 04:02.774
Talking to the captain,

04:02.776 --> 04:05.277
Relaxing in
a spacious seat,

04:05.279 --> 04:08.647
<i>Enjoying a smoke</i>
<i>and free whiskey</i>
<i>brought to me</i>

04:08.649 --> 04:10.882
By a hot,
young stewardess.

04:10.884 --> 04:13.785
Ed, when was
the last time you flew?

04:13.787 --> 04:16.355
Uh, 1975.

04:17.890 --> 04:20.692
Well, the good news
is those same stewardesses
are still working.

04:25.265 --> 04:27.966
Ed:
That flight from l.A.
Was terrible.

04:27.968 --> 04:29.868
Tiny seats,
no meals,

04:29.870 --> 04:32.437
And the drinks
were being served
by the pilots.

04:32.439 --> 04:34.406
Those weren't
the pilots, ed,

04:34.408 --> 04:35.941
They were male
flight attendants.

04:35.943 --> 04:37.476
What?!

04:37.478 --> 04:40.379
Well, I can understand
a woman wanting a man's job,

04:40.381 --> 04:42.481
But what were
those fellas thinking?

04:42.483 --> 04:46.685
It was like being in
a big flying tube of sissy.

04:46.687 --> 04:50.489
At least you didn't have
a screaming baby sitting
behind you the whole time.

04:50.491 --> 04:51.957
I said
I was sorry.

04:51.959 --> 04:56.528
<i>Due to mechanical issues,</i>
<i>flight 451 to lake tahoe</i>

04:56.530 --> 04:57.929
<i>Has been delayed</i>
<i>indefinitely.</i>

04:57.931 --> 04:59.831
<i>We will update you shortly.</i>

04:59.833 --> 05:01.566
Indefinitely?

05:01.568 --> 05:03.035
That bitch
is in every airport

05:03.037 --> 05:05.837
And she never has
anything good to say.

05:06.806 --> 05:08.473
Come on, guys,

05:08.475 --> 05:10.809
You've done
great up until now.
This is a big test for us.

05:10.811 --> 05:12.978
If you can control your anger
for another five hours,

05:12.980 --> 05:14.413
You'll make
the 30-day mark.

05:14.415 --> 05:15.881
Hello, friend.

05:15.883 --> 05:17.783
We are snowboarders
for the lord.

05:17.785 --> 05:19.818
We have to save
13 souls on this trip

05:19.820 --> 05:22.821
And you are going
to be number one.

05:23.923 --> 05:26.458
Oh, crap,
it's the hare christians.

05:30.964 --> 05:34.766
If you died
right now, do you think
you'd go to heaven?

05:34.768 --> 05:36.935
Do you?

05:36.937 --> 05:40.038
Because you can keep talking
and we'll find out for sure.

05:41.475 --> 05:45.711
Why don't you take
ed to the as-far-away-
as-you-can-get store?

05:45.713 --> 05:48.647
I don't know that store.
Where is it?

05:48.649 --> 05:51.483
It's as far away
as you can get.

05:51.485 --> 05:53.552
That seems inconvenient.

05:55.555 --> 05:57.522
Looks like this
is your lucky day.

05:57.524 --> 05:59.491
Now we're free
to save your soul.

05:59.493 --> 06:02.060
Yeah, too late,
my ex-wife got that
in the divorce.

06:04.430 --> 06:06.031
Shoot, no power.

06:08.435 --> 06:12.504
Could you unplug
one of your devices
so I could charge my phone?

06:12.506 --> 06:15.474
How about, let's say,
the hair straightener.

06:15.476 --> 06:17.576
I mean, mission
accomplished, right?

06:18.678 --> 06:20.512
- How about this one?
- ( speaking foreign language )

06:28.388 --> 06:31.857
Yeah, I'd use
my translator app,
but I'm out of power.

06:34.026 --> 06:35.727
Lacey, would you
come over here, please?

06:35.729 --> 06:38.063
Don't start with me.

06:38.065 --> 06:40.832
Anything you eat
at the airport
doesn't count.

06:40.834 --> 06:44.770
I'm having a hard time
talking to these people,
would you mind?

06:44.772 --> 06:47.672
Just because I'm indian,
you think I can speak
their language?

06:47.674 --> 06:49.040
That's so racist.

06:55.681 --> 06:59.451
Would you kindly ask them
to just remove one plug--

06:59.453 --> 07:01.853
Just one--
so I can charge my phone.

07:01.855 --> 07:04.689
I didn't just give him
the indian version of
the finger, did I?

07:04.691 --> 07:05.991
Oh, my god,
just let me handle this.

07:19.939 --> 07:21.573
Lacey, your anger,
don't blow it.

07:21.575 --> 07:23.008
I'm not angry,
I'm being nice.

07:23.010 --> 07:28.113
You're a very bad girl
who consorts with white
pretty boys.

07:28.115 --> 07:30.515
Oh, yeah?
Well, I don't care
what you think.

07:30.517 --> 07:34.119
This is america and you're
not allowed to just go around
saying whatever you want.

07:34.121 --> 07:37.088
Read the "constitution
of independence," bitch.

07:39.692 --> 07:43.495
- Lacey, I think you meant--
- I know I said it wrong,
but he doesn't, so zip it.

07:43.497 --> 07:45.831
Remember,
we're only hours away

07:45.833 --> 07:47.566
From the 30-day mark.
Keep it together.

07:48.701 --> 07:50.635
And, sir,
I am in my 40s,

07:50.637 --> 07:53.104
So I will thank you
to call me a pretty man.

07:56.976 --> 07:59.211
Hello.
Yes, I'd like to order

07:59.213 --> 08:02.481
The gonzalez fight on
pay-per-view tonight.

08:02.483 --> 08:05.183
$65?
That's outrageous!

08:05.185 --> 08:07.085
Put it on my tab.

08:07.087 --> 08:08.553
Charlie goodson.

08:08.555 --> 08:10.222
Thank you.

08:11.824 --> 08:14.092
Martin, what are you
doing here?

08:14.094 --> 08:16.228
I just came over
to watch the fight

08:16.230 --> 08:19.164
And spend a little
father-son time with my boy.

08:19.166 --> 08:21.500
Well, your boy's
outta town.

08:21.502 --> 08:23.502
He is?

08:23.504 --> 08:25.837
Why didn't he tell me?

08:25.839 --> 08:28.573
I was really looking forward
to watching the fight
with him tonight.

08:28.575 --> 08:30.509
Do me a favor,
don't tell him
I watched it alone.

08:30.511 --> 08:34.513
He'd feel terrible
if he knew he disappointed me.

08:34.515 --> 08:36.214
And, by the way, I might ask,
what are you doing here?

08:36.216 --> 08:39.017
Me? I, uh...

08:39.019 --> 08:40.785
I came to clean
his house for him.

08:40.787 --> 08:43.255
I thought it'd be
a nice surprise when
he got home.

08:45.157 --> 08:48.226
I'm not someone
who sneaks around trying
to take advantage of things.

08:48.228 --> 08:51.696
Now if you wouldn't mind,
I'd appreciate it
if you'd leave...

08:51.698 --> 08:53.765
Through the kitchen.

08:53.767 --> 08:55.267
Kitchen? Why?

08:55.269 --> 08:56.601
- <i>( knocks on door )</i>
<i>- what's with the questions?</i>

08:56.603 --> 08:58.236
Please,
leave through the kitchen.

09:00.139 --> 09:02.107
Okay, ma'am,
this location
will work.

09:02.109 --> 09:05.944
But we need a 220 outlet
and a place to feed the crew.

09:05.946 --> 09:07.712
What the hell's
going on here?

09:07.714 --> 09:11.249
I, um-- I brought
in a crew to film me
cleaning the house.

09:11.251 --> 09:14.185
I plan to do a really,
really good job.

09:16.289 --> 09:19.558
Charlie was right,
walking away really
does help.

09:19.560 --> 09:21.760
Especially when you can
walk away right into a bar.

09:21.762 --> 09:23.562
I'll drink to that.

09:24.864 --> 09:28.066
Oh, cheese
and crap on toast.

09:28.068 --> 09:30.602
You and patrick
can split that.

09:31.671 --> 09:34.172
I'll just have
the fried clams.

09:34.174 --> 09:36.341
Here you are,
friends.

09:36.343 --> 09:38.777
You know,
alcohol leads to sin.

09:38.779 --> 09:42.180
Remember, your body
was a temple that
was made by god.

09:42.182 --> 09:44.282
Actually, ed's body
is a beanbag chair

09:44.284 --> 09:47.686
Made of beer and pasta.
But it's his choice,

09:47.688 --> 09:50.255
So if you could please
respect that, yeah,
that'd be great.

09:50.257 --> 09:51.957
Oh, awesome
truth, bro.

09:51.959 --> 09:54.292
But there's none so blind
as those who will not see.

09:54.294 --> 09:57.128
All right, that's it.
It's go time.

09:57.130 --> 09:59.598
Trust me, you're wasting
your time with this man.

09:59.600 --> 10:01.266
He's a secular nudist.

10:01.268 --> 10:05.036
So what about you?
Have you accepted the lord?

10:05.038 --> 10:07.172
Oh, you guys
don't want me.

10:07.174 --> 10:10.308
Unrepentantly gay
and loving every
minute of it.

10:10.310 --> 10:12.010
Next.

10:12.012 --> 10:14.179
Oh, well,
god still loves you, too.

10:14.181 --> 10:15.880
See, our brother jason
here used to be gay.

10:17.817 --> 10:19.284
Used to be gay?

10:19.286 --> 10:21.386
Like what,
like 10 seconds ago?

10:37.303 --> 10:39.671
Don't worry about it,
lacey, I can charge
this somewhere else.

11:04.130 --> 11:06.865
Wow.
What did you
say to them?

11:06.867 --> 11:09.834
I complimented him
on his pants,

11:09.836 --> 11:13.171
Which is the highest honor
you can give to a man
in my culture,

11:13.173 --> 11:15.073
And he was more
than happy to leave.

11:15.075 --> 11:17.075
- Nice pants?
- Mm-hmm.

11:17.077 --> 11:20.245
5,000 years of culture--
that's the best you've got?

11:20.247 --> 11:23.014
- ( cell phone chimes )
- ( lacey gasps )

11:23.016 --> 11:24.783
"I've changed my mind.

11:24.785 --> 11:27.318
I'm ready to commit.
I miss sex."

11:27.320 --> 11:29.254
Give me that.

11:29.256 --> 11:32.257
Ooh, charlie's got
a girlfriend.

11:32.259 --> 11:34.025
Who's robot girl?

11:34.027 --> 11:37.295
Diabolical female machine
powered by my unhappiness.

11:38.798 --> 11:41.099
Who finally,
after all this time,

11:41.101 --> 11:44.736
Is ready to be with me
and I'm stuck in the
san francisco airport.

11:44.738 --> 11:47.238
Wow. Charlie,
you should go back
right now.

11:47.240 --> 11:49.240
I know, I know,
but I don't wanna
abandon the group.

11:49.242 --> 11:51.376
I wanna be there
when you guys reach
this milestone.

11:51.378 --> 11:53.712
No worries.
I'll tell everyone
you had an emergency.

11:53.714 --> 11:55.046
I don't know, lacey.

11:55.048 --> 11:57.482
For once, charlie,
just go do something
for yourself.

11:57.484 --> 11:59.417
It's such
an easy decision.

11:59.419 --> 12:01.219
I know, I know,
but keep convincing me

12:01.221 --> 12:04.756
- So I feel like
I struggled with it.
- Seriously, go.

12:04.758 --> 12:06.357
All right,
I'm gonna do this.

12:06.359 --> 12:08.126
I'm just gonna shoot
her a text and let her
know I'm on my way.

12:08.128 --> 12:10.195
Are you crazy?
Don't do that.
Just show up.

12:10.197 --> 12:12.363
Women love a brj.

12:12.365 --> 12:13.465
Excuse me?

12:13.467 --> 12:15.900
A big romantic gesture.

12:17.336 --> 12:18.303
Wouldn't that be brg?

12:18.305 --> 12:20.371
Maybe the way
you do it.

12:22.408 --> 12:24.976
Excuse me,
I need a flight
to los angeles.

12:24.978 --> 12:30.014
There's one flight left,
but it leaves in 10 minutes.
You want it?

12:30.016 --> 12:31.883
Absolutely.
Here's my card.

12:33.252 --> 12:35.954
Oh, my god.
Charlie goodson.

12:35.956 --> 12:37.188
Yeah.

12:37.190 --> 12:39.090
Don't you recognize me?

12:39.092 --> 12:42.360
Sure, you're the tsa guy.

12:42.362 --> 12:44.929
No. 1995.

12:44.931 --> 12:47.332
Dodger stadium.
The playoffs.

12:47.334 --> 12:49.934
You broke a bat over your knee
and ended your career

12:49.936 --> 12:52.170
Because you were so mad
that a fan reached out

12:52.172 --> 12:53.538
And grabbed a foul ball.

12:53.540 --> 12:56.207
That was me.

12:56.209 --> 12:58.943
Wow.
That was you.

12:58.945 --> 13:01.246
Well, you know what?
I've actually moved on
with my life

13:01.248 --> 13:03.248
And things are working out
pretty well.

13:03.250 --> 13:06.384
So no hard feelings,
I forgive you.

13:06.386 --> 13:08.086
- Here's your ticket, sir.
- Thank you.

13:08.088 --> 13:10.955
- You better hurry,
they're boarding now.
- Thanks.

13:10.957 --> 13:13.391
See, here's the thing...

13:13.393 --> 13:15.393
I don't forgive you.

13:15.395 --> 13:17.395
You ruined my life.

13:19.865 --> 13:21.933
You're not going anywhere.

13:26.071 --> 13:28.206
Okay, the computer.
I'd like you to turn it on,

13:28.208 --> 13:30.975
Turn it off,
then turn it on again.

13:30.977 --> 13:33.044
And while you're doing that,
I'm gonna swab your face

13:33.046 --> 13:35.113
For bomb-making residue.

13:35.115 --> 13:36.981
Why are you
doing this to me?

13:36.983 --> 13:38.316
I'm the one who lost
my baseball career.

13:38.318 --> 13:41.119
Yeah, but you made me
a pariah in my own town.

13:41.121 --> 13:43.555
After you went on the news
and told everyone

13:43.557 --> 13:46.457
That I ruined
the dodgers season,
my whole life fell apart.

13:46.459 --> 13:49.027
I had to move
to a different city.

13:49.029 --> 13:52.130
Now I look at fat people's
silhouettes in a scanner

13:52.132 --> 13:54.065
While my lungs
collect radiation.

13:54.067 --> 13:56.000
That's rough.

13:56.002 --> 13:59.003
You ever give
a 300-pound man
a cavity search?

13:59.005 --> 14:01.573
If I say yes,
will you feel closer
to me and let me go?

14:01.575 --> 14:03.074
No.

14:03.076 --> 14:05.243
I'm just trying
to catch a flight!

14:05.245 --> 14:07.946
Well, I was just trying
to catch a foul ball.

14:07.948 --> 14:11.149
I'm sorry,
is there a problem?

14:11.151 --> 14:12.951
Yes, yes.

14:12.953 --> 14:15.086
This man has
a personal vendetta
against me

14:15.088 --> 14:17.088
And wants me
to miss my flight.

14:17.090 --> 14:19.057
I'm not a terrorist,
this isn't a jihad,

14:19.059 --> 14:21.226
There's no gunpowder
in my computer,

14:21.228 --> 14:24.162
There's no explosives
in my socks, and there's
no heroin in my underwear.

14:24.164 --> 14:28.099
I'm sorry, sir,
you just said four of our
five top watchwords

14:28.101 --> 14:32.103
And now we also have to check
your underwear for heroin.

14:34.907 --> 14:36.908
This is totally
un-american.

14:39.912 --> 14:41.946
I suppose now
you're gonna go get
the rubber gloves.

14:41.948 --> 14:43.514
Oh, yeah.
Thanks for reminding me.

14:43.516 --> 14:45.950
I sometimes
forget those things.

14:53.025 --> 14:56.461
I can't believe
you rented out my son's
house to a movie crew.

14:56.463 --> 14:58.329
They do it
all the time out here,

14:58.331 --> 14:59.964
But my place
wasn't big enough.

14:59.966 --> 15:02.634
Nonetheless, you've gone
way over the line
with this, jen.

15:02.636 --> 15:06.070
Bringing perfect strangers
into a man's house just
to make a few bucks,

15:06.072 --> 15:07.972
I'm gonna have to tell
charlie about this.

15:07.974 --> 15:10.475
It's $8,000.
I'll cut you in for half.

15:10.477 --> 15:13.111
Or we can take it
to our graves.
Either way.

15:14.980 --> 15:17.315
What the hell
is going on in here?

15:17.317 --> 15:20.151
I don't know what
you're referring to.

15:21.954 --> 15:23.488
Charlie left me
in charge of the place

15:23.490 --> 15:25.690
And he never said
anything about
a movie shoot.

15:28.627 --> 15:31.996
Oh, my god,
that's angel lynn foxx.

15:31.998 --> 15:33.932
Angel lynn foxx?

15:33.934 --> 15:36.000
Yeah,
the porn star.

15:36.002 --> 15:39.604
And I know that because
I read an article
about her in...

15:39.606 --> 15:42.941
I'm gonna say
"the new yorker."

15:42.943 --> 15:44.943
You didn't tell me
it was a porno movie!

15:44.945 --> 15:47.045
I had no idea,
martin!

15:47.047 --> 15:50.982
The name of the director
on the contract wasn't a clue?

15:50.984 --> 15:53.985
"penis de laurentiis."

15:53.987 --> 15:56.254
Yeah, I should've
caught that.

15:58.057 --> 15:59.257
This is appalling!

15:59.259 --> 16:00.525
I'm with martin.

16:00.527 --> 16:03.695
I find this demeaning
and shameful

16:03.697 --> 16:06.264
And a little bit sad.

16:06.266 --> 16:09.100
Okay, everybody,
pack up your stuff.

16:09.102 --> 16:10.268
We're going
to my house.

16:13.505 --> 16:16.107
Nolan: I'm really proud
of you for holding it
together, patrick.

16:16.109 --> 16:18.343
- You saved the 30 days.
- Barely.

16:18.345 --> 16:21.379
I mean, where does
he get off calling
my lifestyle unnatural?

16:21.381 --> 16:24.349
He's the one wearing
microfleece polyester.

16:25.451 --> 16:29.187
Hey, lacey. Lacey!
Where's charlie?

16:29.189 --> 16:31.723
Oh, he has
a family emergency

16:31.725 --> 16:33.324
And had to go back
to l.A.

16:33.326 --> 16:35.026
What happened?

16:35.028 --> 16:37.462
His, um, daughter

16:37.464 --> 16:39.664
Went on a field trip
to the aquarium

16:39.666 --> 16:43.101
And she fell
into the whale cage.

16:45.037 --> 16:47.405
I promise,
you're not gonna
find anything.

16:47.407 --> 16:49.273
Why don't you just tell
your supervisor the truth?

16:49.275 --> 16:51.142
Sorry,
but the bomb-sniffing dog

16:51.144 --> 16:54.445
Did react pretty strongly
to your crotch.

16:54.447 --> 16:56.748
All dogs react strongly
to crotches.

16:56.750 --> 17:00.418
That's how they say hello.

17:00.420 --> 17:03.054
Look, todd, this isn't
gonna help you turn
your life around.

17:03.056 --> 17:05.289
You're not gonna be able
to move forward unless you
let go of your anger.

17:05.291 --> 17:07.725
( sighs )
fair enough.

17:07.727 --> 17:09.227
But once the gloves
are ordered,

17:09.229 --> 17:11.295
There's really
nothing I can do.

17:11.297 --> 17:14.098
Look, todd,
can we talk man to man...

17:15.768 --> 17:18.136
To man?

17:18.138 --> 17:20.304
Sure.

17:20.306 --> 17:21.506
Okay, okay.

17:21.508 --> 17:23.808
There's this girl
waiting for me in la.

17:23.810 --> 17:26.444
And for years,
all she wanted to do
was have sex with me,

17:26.446 --> 17:28.813
But then I got this text
saying that she's ready
for a commitment.

17:28.815 --> 17:33.051
You expect us to believe
that a woman only wants sex,

17:33.053 --> 17:35.053
But a man wants
a commitment?

17:35.055 --> 17:38.189
Okay, now this story
is really falling apart.

17:38.191 --> 17:39.757
You believe me,
right, todd?

17:39.759 --> 17:42.260
There's gotta be
some special gal
in your life, right?

17:42.262 --> 17:44.629
Yeah, luanne.

17:44.631 --> 17:47.632
But she left me
after what you did
to me in 1995.

17:47.634 --> 17:51.469
Please, you've gotta let me
get on that flight to la.

17:51.471 --> 17:54.072
I'm sorry,
but your flight
actually just left.

17:54.074 --> 17:56.374
- It left?
- Yes.

17:56.376 --> 17:58.109
Now once we go behind
the privacy screen,

17:58.111 --> 18:00.411
We're gonna need you
to pull down your pants.

18:01.814 --> 18:03.815
But I'm not
even flying anymore.

18:03.817 --> 18:05.583
Now it's just a bad date.

18:05.585 --> 18:08.252
You know what?
I am outta here.

18:15.561 --> 18:16.861
What happened
to you?

18:16.863 --> 18:20.398
Nothing, thank god.

18:20.400 --> 18:22.533
I'm sure lacey
told you, but I have
to get back to la.

18:22.535 --> 18:24.669
I just missed my flight,
so I'll have to rent a car.

18:24.671 --> 18:27.238
But you are only hours away
from the 30-day mark

18:27.240 --> 18:28.840
And I know you can do this.

18:28.842 --> 18:31.542
And sam will be fine,
charlie.

18:31.544 --> 18:34.245
Whales are huge,
but they mostly
eat plankton.

18:35.814 --> 18:38.649
I thought you
weren't gonna get high
until we got to tahoe?

18:41.320 --> 18:43.488
So it's okay
if I keep his crate
in the bathroom?

18:43.490 --> 18:45.123
Wherever his crate is,
that's his home.

18:45.125 --> 18:47.258
The idea is to make him
fit into your lifestyle.

18:47.260 --> 18:50.628
I feel really good
about changing my mind.

18:50.630 --> 18:53.131
I really think I'm ready
for this kind of commitment.

18:53.133 --> 18:54.465
I was just texting a friend

18:54.467 --> 18:57.135
About how much I missed
this little guy.

18:57.137 --> 18:59.437
Did I miss rex?

18:59.439 --> 19:02.306
Yes, I missed rex.

19:02.308 --> 19:05.243
I missed rex a lot.

19:08.147 --> 19:09.847
You know, I'm a little
surprised to see you.

19:09.849 --> 19:12.216
Whatever happened
to the ski trip?

19:12.218 --> 19:14.385
It doesn't matter.
This is more important to me.

19:14.387 --> 19:17.155
Really?
It could have waited.

19:17.157 --> 19:18.222
Well, I couldn't.

19:18.224 --> 19:20.158
Aw, that's really sweet.

19:20.160 --> 19:21.926
All right, ready to see
my little fluff ball?

19:23.562 --> 19:26.597
I just drove five hours,
you're damn right I'm ready.

19:27.633 --> 19:30.401
And I love
the new nickname fluff ball.

19:30.403 --> 19:32.837
Yeah, well,
when you get
a cut and shampoo,

19:32.839 --> 19:35.806
The hair on that thing
really expands.

19:35.808 --> 19:37.375
Really?

19:37.377 --> 19:39.343
And you're gonna love
how it smells.

19:39.345 --> 19:40.945
And wait until you
see that little bow.

19:40.947 --> 19:43.881
Little bow.
That's different.

19:43.883 --> 19:46.817
<i>Yeah, I thought</i>
<i>it'd be too girly,</i>

19:46.819 --> 19:49.353
<i>But, you know,</i>
<i>everyone seems to like it.</i>

19:49.355 --> 19:52.190
Everyone?
Who else has seen it?

19:52.192 --> 19:53.958
<i>Everyone in the building.</i>

19:53.960 --> 19:56.327
<i>I wanted everyone to see</i>

19:56.329 --> 19:58.729
<i>So they'll stop complaining</i>
<i>about the noise.</i>

19:58.731 --> 20:00.698
What noise?

20:02.267 --> 20:03.367
Here's rex.

20:07.873 --> 20:10.641
Charlie, what the hell
are you doing?

20:10.643 --> 20:13.844
I saw this on
the "dog whisperer."

20:13.846 --> 20:15.646
Trust me, it works.

20:16.682 --> 20:19.350
See?
See how calm he is.

20:19.352 --> 20:21.485
Charlie, did you think
we were gonna have sex?

20:21.487 --> 20:23.454
Well,
when you texted me,

20:23.456 --> 20:25.489
"I miss sex,"
I assumed.

20:25.491 --> 20:28.292
Sex? Like I'd suddenly do
a 180 and want to commit?

20:28.294 --> 20:30.561
I wrote, "I miss rex."

20:33.432 --> 20:35.333
The phone
autocorrected me.

20:35.335 --> 20:38.970
Oh, god, I sent
the same text to
my entire family.

20:38.972 --> 20:40.538
No wonder uncle louie
sent me that picture.

20:40.540 --> 20:42.840
I always thought
he was a perv.

20:42.842 --> 20:44.942
Well, maybe you should
read them before
you hit send.

20:44.944 --> 20:46.844
Your phone
is a sex fiend.

20:46.846 --> 20:48.779
Oh, really?

20:50.415 --> 20:53.918
Okay,
"do you like my puppy?"

20:56.822 --> 20:59.624
Okay, it turned
"like" to lick.

20:59.626 --> 21:01.959
And wait till you see
what it did with "puppy."
