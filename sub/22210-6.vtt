00:02.211 --> 00:06.046
<i>My name is Barry Allen,
and I am the fastest man alive.</i>

00:06.381 --> 00:09.215
<i>To the outside world,
I'm an ordinary forensic scientist,</i>

00:09.384 --> 00:12.343
<i>but secretly, with the help
of my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs,</i>

00:12.429 --> 00:14.967
<i>I fight crime
and find other meta-humans like me.</i>

00:15.557 --> 00:17.093
<i>But I became lost in time.</i>

00:17.559 --> 00:20.302
<i>It took everything in my friends'
power to bring me back.</i>

00:20.395 --> 00:23.433
<i>And in doing so our world
was opened up to new threats.</i>

00:23.524 --> 00:25.811
<i>And I am the only one
fast enough to stop them.</i>

00:26.109 --> 00:28.226
<i>I am the Flash.</i>

00:29.655 --> 00:30.645
<i>Previously on</i> The Flash...

00:30.739 --> 00:31.775
What's happened to me?

00:31.865 --> 00:33.731
<i>- Ralph Dibny.
- He used to be a cop.</i>

00:33.825 --> 00:35.908
- A dirty cop.
- I was a good detective.

00:35.994 --> 00:38.111
- This is not my world.
- And Earth-2 is?

00:38.205 --> 00:40.117
Did you make a bunch of friends there
that I don't know about?

00:40.207 --> 00:42.119
You said you were a good cop, be one

00:45.212 --> 00:47.078
- Let me train you.
- For what?

00:47.172 --> 00:48.379
<i>To do what I do.</i>

00:48.465 --> 00:50.001
What made you look into Mayor Bellows?

00:50.092 --> 00:52.550
It was a client. Last name, DeVoe.

00:58.767 --> 01:00.133
I owe ya for the java, rookie.

01:00.310 --> 01:01.721
Can't believe I left my wallet at home.

01:01.812 --> 01:03.428
Don't worry about it,
it could happen to anyone.

01:03.522 --> 01:05.013
Five times in a row.

01:05.691 --> 01:07.853
And could you stop calling me rookie?

01:08.110 --> 01:11.444
Sorry. Old habit from when I was
your superior officer.

01:12.030 --> 01:15.819
You know. Before you got me fired,
ruined my career, destroyed my life,

01:16.118 --> 01:18.656
crushed my spirit. Left me alone
without a friend in the world.

01:18.745 --> 01:21.488
Don't forget how I turned you into
an amorphous stretch-y blob.

01:21.582 --> 01:23.448
Actually, that's the one good thing
you've done for me!

01:23.542 --> 01:24.828
- Right.
- 'Course it wasn't on purpose,

01:24.918 --> 01:25.999
so you don't get credit.

01:26.086 --> 01:28.373
Both of ya, hand over your cash! Now!

01:29.256 --> 01:32.420
Hey. Pardon us. Okay? One second.

01:32.843 --> 01:34.960
Okay. This is perfect.
I've been teaching you, right?

01:35.053 --> 01:36.840
Muggers are like Superhero 101.

01:36.930 --> 01:38.842
- Ah, Ralphy likey.
<i>- What's your plan?</i>

01:38.932 --> 01:41.345
Okay. I was thinking about this
in the shower this morning,

01:41.435 --> 01:44.348
how sweet would it be
to turn into a giant slingshot?

01:45.314 --> 01:46.930
It's a weird plan, but okay.

01:47.357 --> 01:49.565
- I got an even cooler idea!
- Hey!

01:50.235 --> 01:51.521
I'm still robbing you guys.

01:51.612 --> 01:54.571
We will be right with you, sir. Please!

01:55.449 --> 01:57.566
<i>Okay, what if I did like
a human-slinky thing</i>

01:57.659 --> 01:59.275
<i>maybe wrap him up,
throw in a few on-theme puns.</i>

01:59.369 --> 02:01.702
Whatever, Ralph.
We just gotta hurry up a little bit.

02:01.788 --> 02:05.156
Relax, rookie. I've seen a lot
of thugs. This guy's no shooter.

02:08.711 --> 02:09.747
My leg!

02:11.173 --> 02:12.960
Well, our work here is done.

02:13.133 --> 02:15.591
Hey, what're you doing? We can't
just leave. You just shot him.

02:15.677 --> 02:17.384
I didn't shoot him. He shot him.

02:17.471 --> 02:19.508
- Well...
- Do you feel like I shot you?

02:21.516 --> 02:23.473
You. Stop shooting him!

02:23.560 --> 02:27.144
- I am not shooting him!
- They shot my ass!

02:27.230 --> 02:29.096
Okay. So, he's
a little banged up, but...

02:29.191 --> 02:31.558
We caught the bad guy.
Isn't that what superheroes do?

02:31.652 --> 02:34.816
No. A superhero's
first job is to protect people.

02:34.905 --> 02:38.569
Oh, God! What's the second job?
Long-winded lectures before noon?

02:38.659 --> 02:43.575
I barely... Take this. One day, gonna
throw a lightning bolt so far...

02:43.789 --> 02:45.155
I'm taking him to the hospital.

02:45.749 --> 02:47.411
And you owe me five coffees.

02:48.460 --> 02:52.625
It's fine. I know. Come on, get up.
Not gonna hurt you. This way, come on.

02:57.803 --> 03:01.888
Hey. He left his gun!
He's reformed already!

03:09.898 --> 03:11.014
We need to talk.

03:12.025 --> 03:13.766
The only way it can end...

03:14.778 --> 03:15.814
With my victory.

03:16.029 --> 03:17.019
What?

03:19.324 --> 03:23.238
Fine. Let us take the long way
and continue.

03:23.745 --> 03:25.907
Today, for the first time,

03:26.081 --> 03:27.822
events will align that give Team Flash

03:27.916 --> 03:29.327
a chance to discover your identity.

03:29.793 --> 03:31.329
This is earlier than you anticipated.

03:31.420 --> 03:34.163
- It is of no concern.
- Like hell! You know what's at risk.

03:34.256 --> 03:35.372
What we're doing.

03:35.716 --> 03:38.424
If you've miscalculated
by even a decimal...

03:38.510 --> 03:42.720
There is not a decimal,
a fraction, an infinitesimal variable

03:42.931 --> 03:45.093
beyond my thought!

03:46.435 --> 03:47.551
Beyond my mind.

03:47.644 --> 03:51.684
Even now, of the 7,798 variations

03:51.773 --> 03:56.359
of this argument, I have anticipated
them all and know how it ends.

03:56.445 --> 03:57.686
Then how does it end?

04:01.241 --> 04:03.403
The only way it can end...

04:05.120 --> 04:06.281
With my victory.

04:24.514 --> 04:26.551
Ouch! All nighter, huh?

04:26.641 --> 04:28.223
I haven't been this tired
since Killer Frost

04:28.310 --> 04:29.801
decided to go to Burning Man.

04:29.895 --> 04:33.980
Yeah? Well, how's our search
for the mysterious DeVoe coming?

04:34.065 --> 04:35.897
Allen, we're searching
for an evil mastermind.

04:35.984 --> 04:37.646
The only clue we have to go on
is his name,

04:37.736 --> 04:40.069
of which there're literally thousands.
So, how's the search going? It's...

04:41.281 --> 04:42.271
Fantastic.

04:43.533 --> 04:45.445
- I missed that.
- If we're gonna find DeVoe,

04:45.619 --> 04:46.780
we need more brain power.

04:47.120 --> 04:50.454
Well, why didn't you say so?
One master detective ready to detect.

04:50.665 --> 04:52.327
I said, "More brain power."

04:53.710 --> 04:55.622
<i>Initiating emergency oxygen purge...</i>

04:55.712 --> 04:59.251
<i>- In ten, nine, eight, seven...</i>
- I, I...

04:59.341 --> 05:02.129
- I...
<i>- ...six, five, four...</i>

05:02.219 --> 05:05.212
- One more second...
<i>- ...three, two, one...</i>

05:05.806 --> 05:08.173
Like I said, we need more help.
Maybe I should call my friends.

05:09.309 --> 05:10.595
- Your what?
- My friends.

05:10.977 --> 05:13.264
- Is he saying friends?
- I think he's being sarcastic.

05:13.355 --> 05:15.847
No, this is delirium. He's cracked
from being awake all night.

05:15.941 --> 05:18.228
Hey, Harry. All of your friends
are in this room!

05:18.318 --> 05:21.152
I have other friends. You asked me to
make new friends, I made new friends.

05:21.238 --> 05:23.446
It was a task. I complete tasks.

05:23.615 --> 05:25.447
That's so great.
I can't wait to meet them.

05:25.617 --> 05:28.826
Harry, you listened to me!
I'm so proud of you.

05:29.246 --> 05:30.453
Okay, there's no pride...

05:30.539 --> 05:33.122
Put that down.
Look, my friends are smart,

05:33.208 --> 05:34.949
they'll help us. I'll call them.

05:40.465 --> 05:44.004
All right. In the meantime, we gotta
find the rest of these bus metas.

05:44.094 --> 05:46.461
Somehow they're connected
to DeVoe's plan.

05:47.430 --> 05:50.969
You were on the bus. Can you remember
anybody else who was?

05:51.059 --> 05:53.392
Well, I was in between
drunk and hungover at the time.

05:54.229 --> 05:56.437
She is cute. What's her deal?

05:56.648 --> 05:58.435
- She's in jail.
- When are visiting hours?

05:59.568 --> 06:02.561
What about vibing the rest
of the bus passengers?

06:02.654 --> 06:04.941
I tried, but, you know, the...

06:05.240 --> 06:08.654
The dark matter we release was such
a massive space-time event

06:08.743 --> 06:12.236
that my energy just reflected back
and I ended up vibing myself.

06:13.164 --> 06:15.201
I'm pretty sure
I relived my own birth...

06:16.251 --> 06:17.367
Or was that my death?

06:17.460 --> 06:19.577
You know, there are other
non-traumatizing ways

06:19.671 --> 06:21.913
of bringing Ralph's memory back.
Like hypnosis.

06:22.257 --> 06:23.247
Is that really a thing?

06:23.341 --> 06:25.082
I mean, not the whole
cartoon pocket-watch version.

06:25.176 --> 06:27.384
But yeah, real hypnosis can be used
to recover memories.

06:27.721 --> 06:29.303
- All right. Do you know any hypnotists?
- Mm-hmm.

06:29.389 --> 06:30.971
- Not me.
- You lost me at cartoon.

06:31.433 --> 06:34.221
All right. So who's gonna
hypnotize Ralph?

06:34.686 --> 06:35.972
I'm Doctor Sharon Finkel.

06:36.229 --> 06:38.186
Dr. Finkel, thank you so much
for squeezing us in.

06:38.273 --> 06:41.857
Our friend Ralph here is having
trouble remembering information,

06:42.569 --> 06:44.777
for a detective case. Right, Ralph?

06:45.655 --> 06:47.647
So, I see

06:47.824 --> 06:49.110
you didn't go to Harvard.

06:50.160 --> 06:51.947
No, did you?

06:54.456 --> 06:55.446
I see what you did there.

06:55.665 --> 06:58.373
If you could fix his personality, too,
that'd be great.

06:58.668 --> 07:01.456
Give it up, rookie. This psycho-hooey
is never gonna work on me.

07:02.631 --> 07:04.418
- Well, that was quick.
<i>- Yeah.</i>

07:04.507 --> 07:08.501
Now, remember with me, Ralph.
It's a month ago.

07:08.887 --> 07:11.345
You're on a bus. What do you see?

07:11.973 --> 07:16.308
<i>I see someone crying.</i>

07:17.312 --> 07:19.019
Dude's really bumming me out.

07:19.564 --> 07:22.272
Hey. Cheer up, buddy!
You can do it!

07:25.654 --> 07:26.644
What else do you see?

07:27.280 --> 07:31.445
<i>I see some women.
I can't see their faces.</i>

07:31.952 --> 07:35.116
34-32-36. 38-34-32.

07:35.372 --> 07:36.362
Are those bus routes?

07:37.374 --> 07:39.366
I think they are measurements.

07:39.751 --> 07:40.787
Ew.

07:41.378 --> 07:43.916
<i>I see something else. I see a...</i>

07:46.341 --> 07:47.582
<i>It's a bison.</i>

07:49.052 --> 07:51.465
Does a bison mean anything
to either of you?

07:55.642 --> 07:58.385
This hocus-pocus is never gonna work
on a guy like me.

07:58.478 --> 07:59.844
But we can try it if you want.

08:01.940 --> 08:03.147
How'd you guys get over there?

08:47.777 --> 08:50.815
Security guard found him here
this morning. Haven't ID'd him yet.

08:50.905 --> 08:52.862
His personal effects
are scattered everywhere.

08:52.949 --> 08:55.407
So we didn't find his wallet.
But we may find it

08:55.493 --> 08:57.701
when we find the rest of his briefcase.

08:58.747 --> 09:00.033
And his missing hand.

09:01.916 --> 09:03.578
Well, judging by that avulsion

09:03.668 --> 09:06.206
and the claw marks, I'd say
a large predatory animal did this.

09:06.629 --> 09:09.793
But whatever it was would
have to have four-inch canines,

09:09.883 --> 09:13.718
a bite force of 5,000 psi,
and weigh over a ton.

09:14.262 --> 09:15.719
That animal doesn't exist.

09:16.014 --> 09:17.300
Then what the hell did this?

09:22.395 --> 09:23.636
You don't think...

09:31.446 --> 09:34.154
Do you remember back in the day
when we wouldn't calmly consider

09:34.240 --> 09:36.277
a stone statue our prime suspect?

09:36.367 --> 09:37.699
No. I actually don't.

09:49.297 --> 09:50.413
Blood.

09:58.681 --> 10:01.389
All right, my friends.
We got meats.

10:01.476 --> 10:05.060
We got cheeses, we got guac,
we got beer.

10:05.563 --> 10:08.351
And of course, we got my favorite chips!

10:08.775 --> 10:10.983
Let's get this confab poppin'.
Are your friends coming?

10:11.069 --> 10:13.277
Yeah, let me just calibrate
the multi-verse holo-projector,

10:13.363 --> 10:14.353
and we'll be on our way.

10:15.073 --> 10:16.109
Your friends are from different Earths?

10:16.866 --> 10:17.856
No, but I thought

10:18.076 --> 10:20.159
multi-verse holo-projector
would've given you that clue,

10:20.245 --> 10:23.454
but, apparently not.
Yes, they're from other Earths.

10:24.916 --> 10:27.249
And we're off and running.

10:27.335 --> 10:28.997
Well, allow me to make
some introductions.

10:29.087 --> 10:32.706
From Earth-12, the holder of four
PhDs and the author of the book

10:32.799 --> 10:34.916
<i>So Why'd You Buy This Book?,</i>

10:35.009 --> 10:38.343
I give you,
<i>Herr</i> Harrison Wolfgang Wells.

10:38.429 --> 10:40.967
<i>- Guten Tag,</i> Wells.
<i>- Guten Tag.</i>

10:41.057 --> 10:43.265
Do you know
that it amuses me that you think

10:43.351 --> 10:45.764
that saving your tiny world matters,

10:45.854 --> 10:47.265
when the entire multi-verse

10:47.355 --> 10:50.393
will inevitably be consumed
in a fiery heat desk?

10:50.900 --> 10:52.937
- Desk?
- Yeah, that's what I said, desk.

10:54.404 --> 10:55.394
Death.

10:55.488 --> 10:57.229
Yeah, death. What are you, deaf?

10:57.323 --> 10:58.814
- Yeah.
- You must be

10:58.908 --> 11:00.490
the little one they call Cisco.

11:00.743 --> 11:02.860
- Not that...
- I'm 5'7". <i>Guten Tag.</i>

11:03.288 --> 11:05.701
All right. Moving on. From Earth-47.

11:06.124 --> 11:09.288
I give you the billionaire-inventor
and publishing tycoon

11:09.460 --> 11:11.372
General Champion of Free Speech,

11:11.629 --> 11:13.120
H. Lothario Wells.

11:13.381 --> 11:15.623
<i>That's right. Keep that coming.
Now try the other one on.</i>

11:15.717 --> 11:18.380
<i>No, not the Crocs.
Just the other leopard prints...</i>

11:18.469 --> 11:19.835
- It's really...
- What's going on?

11:19.929 --> 11:22.012
He's otherwise occupied.

11:22.098 --> 11:24.966
Oh, golly, there you are.

11:25.518 --> 11:28.477
My apologies. Appears that you all
caught us red-handed here

11:28.563 --> 11:30.646
at the mansion on dress-up night.
You know what they say,

11:30.732 --> 11:33.019
intellect is the greatest aphrodisiac.

11:33.109 --> 11:34.691
Yeah, so. Nobody says that.

11:34.944 --> 11:37.277
Here's to rising IQ's and libidos.

11:40.325 --> 11:41.941
Hate to call two a pattern here, Harry,

11:42.035 --> 11:43.071
but aren't your friends...

11:43.161 --> 11:46.325
And from the post-apocalyptic
landscape of Earth-22,

11:46.414 --> 11:48.747
where man and machine
have become one in order to survive,

11:49.083 --> 11:51.200
I give you, Wells 2.0.

11:52.295 --> 11:54.378
<i>Right. Let's make this quick.</i>

11:55.256 --> 11:57.623
Reapers have raided our petrol supplies

11:57.717 --> 12:01.461
and stolen our water tanks.
I'd like to smash them to bits.

12:01.596 --> 12:03.212
What? It's a party now.

12:03.640 --> 12:05.597
Forget not about me!

12:05.767 --> 12:09.101
'Tis I, Wells the Grey...

12:11.272 --> 12:13.059
Sorry. It's a bad connection.

12:13.149 --> 12:14.765
Yeah. That was a terrible connection.

12:14.859 --> 12:15.849
Good on you.

12:16.486 --> 12:18.022
That dude was strange.

12:18.780 --> 12:19.770
- Harry?
- Yeah?

12:19.864 --> 12:22.151
- Sidebar.
- We're gonna, sidebar.

12:23.243 --> 12:26.486
So, remember when I said,
"Make friends"?

12:26.788 --> 12:28.700
I didn't mean with yourself.

12:28.915 --> 12:30.406
They're great, aren't they?

12:30.500 --> 12:32.833
And some of the brightest minds
in all the multi-verse.

12:32.919 --> 12:36.162
Good company, too, I might add.
I mean, that Harrison Wolfgang Wells.

12:40.176 --> 12:42.008
- The guy's hilarious.
- Look, we're desperate.

12:42.095 --> 12:43.927
- Sure we are.
- So, I think

12:44.013 --> 12:45.675
we should give
the Council of Wells a chance.

12:45.765 --> 12:47.427
- Council of Wells?
- Pretty good name, right?

12:47.517 --> 12:48.598
- Yes, it is.
- I know.

12:48.685 --> 12:49.675
- All right.
- All right.

12:49.769 --> 12:50.759
- Fellas. Will you...
- Fellas.

12:50.853 --> 12:51.843
No, do your thing.

12:52.063 --> 12:54.646
- Here's how it's gonna go down.
<i>- Nein.</i> Halt.

12:54.732 --> 12:58.351
You're unnecessary also,
not wanted, so...

12:59.070 --> 13:02.484
Off you go. Off you go. Off you go.

13:02.573 --> 13:03.905
Still here. Off you go.

13:03.992 --> 13:05.904
And even I know when
you got too many partners.

13:05.994 --> 13:09.738
I know I may be half machine.
But you're all useless.

13:09.831 --> 13:12.323
I think what the fellas
are trying to say here,

13:12.709 --> 13:14.120
is that they prefer to work alone.

13:14.794 --> 13:16.251
- You don't say.
- I just did.

13:16.337 --> 13:17.919
- Don't just say it.
- He just said it.

13:19.048 --> 13:21.506
Fine. You enjoy your road-kill.

13:22.176 --> 13:23.758
You won't be eating my favorite chips.

13:24.512 --> 13:26.344
We had a Cisco on my Earth once.

13:27.473 --> 13:28.634
He was delicious.

13:28.808 --> 13:31.141
He ate another Cisco.

13:36.024 --> 13:39.438
I'm gonna leave you to you.

13:44.073 --> 13:47.612
So this stone sample shows absolutely
no unique attributes of any kind.

13:47.702 --> 13:49.238
Totally normal granite statue.

13:49.537 --> 13:52.655
Except, it's filled with traces
of the dark matter

13:52.749 --> 13:55.412
on a molecular level,
as if it's been flooded with it.

13:55.501 --> 13:56.708
So, another bus meta...

13:56.794 --> 13:59.081
One that somehow brings
inanimate objects to life.

13:59.172 --> 14:00.583
And uses them to kill.

14:00.965 --> 14:04.003
How can this possibly be, possible?

14:04.093 --> 14:05.334
My best guess?

14:05.428 --> 14:08.387
This meta has the ability to leave
a psychic imprint on objects

14:08.473 --> 14:11.432
A sort of telekinetic puppeteering
through a subconscious link.

14:11.601 --> 14:13.809
That's really smart, 34-25-34.

14:15.563 --> 14:17.680
- Did he just give my...
- No, ignore him.

14:17.774 --> 14:19.731
<i>Um... Well, look,</i>

14:19.817 --> 14:22.605
the good thing is, our rifles have
a "blow statues to hell" setting,

14:22.695 --> 14:25.733
so when this meta does show up,
we'll be ready.

14:25.823 --> 14:26.813
I hope we're ready now.

14:28.076 --> 14:30.238
Our victim's name is Jim Fox.

14:30.328 --> 14:32.411
He was an auctioneer at Wetherby's.

14:32.538 --> 14:35.076
He was transporting a Native American
artifact when he was attacked.

14:35.458 --> 14:36.824
We just don't know which one.

14:36.918 --> 14:38.159
Oh, wait. Maybe we do.

14:39.337 --> 14:40.373
<i>A bison necklace.</i>

14:40.546 --> 14:43.163
Ralph, you said you saw a bison
on the bus, right? I mean...

14:43.716 --> 14:45.298
Nothing in our world is a coincidence.

14:46.344 --> 14:47.926
- Vindicated.
- No one said you were lying.

14:48.262 --> 14:49.469
I could see it in your eyes.

14:49.555 --> 14:50.671
<i>According
to this auction report</i>

14:50.765 --> 14:52.722
the necklace was separated
into three pieces.

14:52.892 --> 14:54.633
The first was in the briefcase,
the third is unknown,

14:54.727 --> 14:57.060
but the second was in the hands
of a private collector.

14:57.230 --> 14:58.391
Christoph Banks.

14:58.481 --> 15:01.098
I'll get the CCPD. Get his address.
He may be in danger.

15:01.484 --> 15:03.521
Then we better pay him a visit.
You ready to suit up?

15:03.611 --> 15:06.820
Oh, yeah! Where's my suit?

15:07.615 --> 15:09.607
<i>Now, this is just a prototype,</i>

15:09.700 --> 15:12.864
but she's got an adaptive,
nano-weave structure

15:12.954 --> 15:14.195
that is, wait for it...

15:14.789 --> 15:17.953
Malleable, on a sub-molecular level.

15:18.042 --> 15:19.283
Don't know what that means, don't care.

15:19.377 --> 15:21.494
Just yank the tarp off.
I'm ready for my super-suit.

15:23.214 --> 15:24.204
Ralph,

15:25.049 --> 15:26.836
this "tarp" is your super-suit.

15:28.636 --> 15:30.593
When you stretch, it stretches.

15:30.888 --> 15:33.050
When you squish, it squishes.

15:34.058 --> 15:35.924
Squishes into something butt-ugly.

15:36.310 --> 15:39.519
Where's the style? The flair?
Dibny needs to peacock.

15:39.605 --> 15:43.144
Dibny needs to wear the prototype
Cisco so lovingly made for him.

15:43.317 --> 15:45.730
Either that or you fight crime naked.

15:46.320 --> 15:47.902
No, don't fight crime naked.

15:51.242 --> 15:53.234
What is this? A puppy's raincoat?

15:57.790 --> 15:59.827
The collection really is
quite impressive, isn't it?

16:01.919 --> 16:04.332
It's taken no small amount
of resources to acquire.

16:06.382 --> 16:08.874
I'm just glad to share it
with someone who appreciates it.

16:10.428 --> 16:11.418
That, I do.

16:11.596 --> 16:14.384
So this book you're writing?
It's on Sioux artifacts?

16:15.099 --> 16:18.092
My entire bloodline is Sioux.
Lakota to be exact.

16:19.145 --> 16:20.226
Ah...

16:20.646 --> 16:22.763
Then you're gonna love this.

16:24.442 --> 16:27.935
This is a Lakota peace pipe.

16:28.029 --> 16:30.612
Had to have it taken apart
and repaired so it can be smoked.

16:33.910 --> 16:34.900
Wanna try it?

16:35.661 --> 16:38.278
That which you call a "peace pipe"
is no such thing.

16:38.706 --> 16:41.198
It is a sacred gift for prayer
from Ptesan-Wi,

16:41.417 --> 16:43.249
bringer of the Seven Sacred Rights,

16:43.711 --> 16:44.952
the White Buffalo Calf Woman.

16:45.922 --> 16:48.289
You'd never hang
a Christian cross upside down,

16:48.716 --> 16:50.799
or lay an American flag on the floor,

16:51.093 --> 16:52.925
yet you destroy that which is wakan,

16:53.596 --> 16:56.930
what is holy, by letting it
touch your filthy flesh.

16:57.266 --> 16:59.724
But I'm here to teach you
the price for your impudence.

16:59.894 --> 17:00.884
Who do you think you are?

17:01.437 --> 17:02.769
I am the Black Bison.

17:16.786 --> 17:17.776
Enough.

17:20.373 --> 17:23.582
Whoa! Now, that is a cool suit.

17:23.751 --> 17:25.242
Remind me to take some pics for Cisco...

17:30.258 --> 17:31.499
<i>Help. Don't leave me.</i>

17:46.023 --> 17:47.264
You let her get away.

17:54.991 --> 17:56.903
I'm getting the same traces
of dark matter from this

17:56.993 --> 17:58.359
that I was from the tiger's statue.

17:58.452 --> 18:01.115
Looks like our meta isn't restricted
to animating just stone.

18:01.205 --> 18:03.117
No. But she does have some limitations.

18:03.207 --> 18:04.664
Out of all the artifacts in the office,

18:04.750 --> 18:05.991
she could only control the knight.

18:06.085 --> 18:07.621
So, then maybe her
psychic imprint abilities

18:07.712 --> 18:09.169
are just restricted to effigies.

18:10.506 --> 18:12.919
- It just means statues.
- Yeah, I don't know.

18:13.175 --> 18:14.211
Sounds kinda dirty to me.

18:14.510 --> 18:18.504
So, if the statue looks like people or
animals, she can bring them to life.

18:18.931 --> 18:21.423
Good thing there's only thousands
of those in the city.

18:21.767 --> 18:23.850
I got a hit on facial recognition.

18:24.312 --> 18:26.770
<i>Mina Chaytan.
Professor of Cultural Anthropology.</i>

18:26.856 --> 18:28.472
- She's a teacher?
- Was.

18:28.774 --> 18:30.857
She became an activist,
but she lost her job

18:30.943 --> 18:32.605
six months ago after being arrested.

18:32.695 --> 18:34.527
Breaking and entering,
trespassing, burglary.

18:34.614 --> 18:36.651
Quite an activist.
The charges were dropped,

18:36.741 --> 18:38.357
but the university still let her go.

18:38.451 --> 18:42.161
She was trying to reclaim several
Sioux art pieces from the museum.

18:42.371 --> 18:44.363
Chaytan was at this even before
she was a meta.

18:44.665 --> 18:46.873
Yeah. Except now she's
upped her game to homicide.

18:47.501 --> 18:48.912
She wants the third piece
of that necklace

18:49.003 --> 18:50.960
- Let's find it before she does.
- Okay.

18:51.297 --> 18:52.913
West and West are on the case.

18:55.217 --> 18:56.207
What's wrong with you?

18:57.261 --> 18:59.378
You let her get away.
We could've caught her.

18:59.597 --> 19:01.714
Yeah, I let her go
but I also saved Banks' life.

19:01.807 --> 19:03.844
That was the most important thing
in that situation.

19:04.060 --> 19:06.393
Really, Allen? Because to me,
when I was a cop,

19:06.479 --> 19:08.971
getting the bad guy,
that was the most important thing.

19:09.315 --> 19:12.274
You're the Flash. You could've
saved him and caught her.

19:12.985 --> 19:15.693
All right. Look, Ralph,
I'm always gonna make the decision

19:15.780 --> 19:17.988
to help the person in danger first.

19:18.157 --> 19:19.318
That's what we do here.

19:20.576 --> 19:21.566
All right, well.

19:21.661 --> 19:24.654
We'll file all that under "Superhero
Lesson of the Day," y'know?

19:28.584 --> 19:30.621
- ...part chicken.
- Guys, guys.

19:31.087 --> 19:32.294
I still think the best thing we can do

19:32.380 --> 19:35.464
is figure out what is DeVoe's goal
and from there we can track...

19:35.549 --> 19:37.006
Ugh, that's a simple plan

19:37.093 --> 19:38.880
- from a simple man.
- That's not helping.

19:38.969 --> 19:41.211
<i>Why don't we use
the Bates-Novick Method first?</i>

19:41.305 --> 19:43.843
We determine why each meta
developed their super-powers,

19:44.725 --> 19:46.136
then we smash them to bits.

19:46.227 --> 19:48.184
I've seen a lot of strange here, but...

19:48.562 --> 19:49.848
This takes all the cakes.

19:49.939 --> 19:52.647
Okay, Council of Wells. How we doing?

19:52.733 --> 19:54.144
Have we found our mystery foe yet?

19:54.235 --> 19:57.319
No, we can't even agree
on what methodology to use.

19:57.446 --> 19:58.436
- What?
- Yes.

19:58.531 --> 19:59.942
- You've had an entire day.
- I know.

20:00.241 --> 20:01.231
- Wait.
<i>- What?</i>

20:01.534 --> 20:03.366
- Weren't there three of you?
- Whoo!

20:03.452 --> 20:06.195
Thanks for the merry-go-round,
sweetheart. You know what I mean.

20:06.288 --> 20:08.075
Sorry, I had to take care of
some off-camera business.

20:08.332 --> 20:09.573
Oh, my God!

20:09.667 --> 20:12.080
- What?
- I can see your frank and beans.

20:12.420 --> 20:13.410
Come on now.

20:13.754 --> 20:14.961
I do my best thinking commando,

20:15.047 --> 20:17.084
plus it ain't like
we all haven't seen it before.

20:17.174 --> 20:18.506
I haven't seen it.

20:18.843 --> 20:21.085
You guys are so uptight.

20:21.178 --> 20:24.342
All right. Can we just get back
to the task at hand? We need answers.

20:24.432 --> 20:26.515
The best answer is always the simplest.

20:26.892 --> 20:31.387
Why don't we go to every DeVoe
we can find and interrogate him?

20:34.316 --> 20:37.104
- What, even the baby DeVoe?
- Especially the baby DeVoe.

20:37.194 --> 20:38.856
Baby violence solves nothing.

20:41.323 --> 20:43.690
Gentlemen, clearly, this isn't working.

20:43.784 --> 20:45.366
And by the way, it's not me.

20:46.162 --> 20:47.152
It's you.

20:47.747 --> 20:50.114
This was a bad idea.

20:51.751 --> 20:53.708
It's like your junk
has been burned into my brain.

20:53.794 --> 20:54.784
You're welcome.

20:55.546 --> 20:57.162
We've got the third piece
of the necklace.

20:57.256 --> 20:59.999
My dad found out that it was
on display at Central City Museum,

21:00.092 --> 21:02.505
but when they figured out
that it was a target...

21:02.720 --> 21:03.881
<i>- It's on the move.
- Yeah.</i>

21:03.971 --> 21:05.428
It's being transferred via armored car

21:05.514 --> 21:07.506
to a secure storage facility
in Brookfield Heights.

21:07.975 --> 21:09.307
I pinged the truck's GPS.

21:09.393 --> 21:11.760
All right. Ralph, let's go.

21:13.731 --> 21:14.892
I'll get my ugly suit.

21:30.539 --> 21:31.950
Kittens...

22:03.572 --> 22:04.608
<i>Hello.</i>

22:05.783 --> 22:06.990
Are you ready to go to jail?

22:08.369 --> 22:10.531
This doesn't belong in an auction house.

22:11.247 --> 22:13.159
It doesn't belong
in someone's collection.

22:13.249 --> 22:15.832
It belongs to the Sioux people.
My people.

22:15.960 --> 22:19.328
Mina, I know you've been through
a lot, but this is not the way to...

22:19.421 --> 22:22.129
I don't need to listen
to men like you anymore, Flash.

22:22.383 --> 22:25.547
A few weeks ago,
something inside me changed.

22:26.011 --> 22:28.674
Changed for the better.
For the more powerful.

22:29.348 --> 22:30.839
And now there's just the Black Bison.

22:40.192 --> 22:41.182
Oh, no, you don't.

23:07.553 --> 23:09.886
The power lines. Get those people clear!

23:10.055 --> 23:11.421
But I can catch the meta.

23:14.935 --> 23:15.925
Laura!

23:18.689 --> 23:20.851
Whoa! Whoa!

23:28.782 --> 23:29.772
Told you I'd get her.

23:31.201 --> 23:32.817
- Hey, the power's out.
- Help!

23:32.912 --> 23:35.029
- I can't keep holding it up.
- Laura.

23:35.748 --> 23:36.738
<i>Laura.</i>

23:39.126 --> 23:40.116
I got her.

23:41.295 --> 23:44.254
EMTs are almost here.
She's still breathing.

23:44.632 --> 23:46.715
Come on, wake up, honey.

23:53.057 --> 23:54.423
I need you to wake up.

23:55.142 --> 23:56.303
<i>Come on, honey.</i>

24:02.942 --> 24:04.274
Hey, you just rest up, okay?

24:04.360 --> 24:06.443
<i>I'm gonna come back and
check on you in a little while.</i>

24:10.032 --> 24:13.116
Well, a mild concussion,
and a hairline fracture in her leg.

24:13.911 --> 24:15.072
She's young, so she'll heal fast.

24:15.788 --> 24:18.405
- Okay. Thank you, Doctor.
- You're very welcome.

24:19.041 --> 24:21.909
But considering the accident,
she's very lucky to be alive.

24:25.673 --> 24:27.460
Look, Ralph, we need to talk.
You can't...

24:27.549 --> 24:29.336
Don't. Just...

24:31.345 --> 24:32.927
Just forget it, okay?

24:45.234 --> 24:48.398
Hey, buddy. You planning on bringing
the band back together

24:48.487 --> 24:49.978
or should I clear out the speed lab?

24:51.365 --> 24:53.857
Broom it. We don't need
that Council of Incompetents.

24:54.159 --> 24:55.275
Ah?

24:55.369 --> 24:56.951
Is that what we're
calling them now, 'cause...

24:57.246 --> 24:58.407
I distinctly remember you saying

24:58.497 --> 25:00.659
they were the brightest minds
in all the multi-verse.

25:00.749 --> 25:01.956
And the most annoying.

25:02.042 --> 25:04.580
I thought if I surrounded myself
with people like me,

25:04.670 --> 25:06.161
I would like them. I don't like them.

25:06.255 --> 25:07.837
I hate them. I hate them all.

25:08.382 --> 25:11.250
- Hmm... Strong words.
- You saw them, Ramon, right?

25:11.427 --> 25:13.919
That Wolfgang Wells,
he's always correcting people,

25:14.013 --> 25:15.174
an extremely annoying habit.

25:15.264 --> 25:18.052
The other guy, the "Free Willy"
Wells, he is so full of himself.

25:18.142 --> 25:20.054
And the other cyborg Wells,
you know how he lost his eye?

25:20.144 --> 25:22.181
His daughter gouged it out at the
Solstice Combat Games.

25:22.271 --> 25:23.682
I don't blame her.
I'd have done the same.

25:23.772 --> 25:25.229
I'd like to gouge out the other eye.

25:26.316 --> 25:27.397
- Harry.
- What?

25:27.484 --> 25:30.852
You know you're essentially
complaining about yourself, right?

25:32.072 --> 25:35.065
Ramon, do your best to pay attention
to the conversation.

25:35.159 --> 25:38.493
I'm not complaining about myself.
I'm complaining about them.

25:38.579 --> 25:40.992
Yes, we're doppelgangers. We look alike.

25:41.081 --> 25:43.448
We have completely
different personalities.

25:44.001 --> 25:46.789
So you don't think you can be
quick to correct people?

25:46.879 --> 25:48.370
You don't think
you can be full of yourself?

25:48.464 --> 25:50.456
Full of myself? No, I'm amazing.

25:50.549 --> 25:52.461
I'm fantastic. I'm talking about them.

25:52.551 --> 25:54.964
I don't like them.
I hate them. I hate them all.

25:55.471 --> 25:58.464
You know what I think? I think
this is entirely about yourself.

25:58.557 --> 26:00.469
I think underneath
all your brain and bluster,

26:00.559 --> 26:02.471
you actually don't have
a very high opinion of yourself.

26:02.770 --> 26:03.760
What?

26:03.854 --> 26:05.595
Why do you think it's so hard
for you to make new friends?

26:06.023 --> 26:08.015
- Well...
- Harry.

26:08.859 --> 26:11.897
No one's gonna like you,
if you don't like yourself first.

26:13.822 --> 26:18.362
These weirdos over here, they didn't
have to answer our call for help.

26:19.328 --> 26:22.366
But they did.
'Cause you would've done the same.

26:22.831 --> 26:26.324
And yes, there are some
really annoying, rough parts of you,

26:26.418 --> 26:29.377
but you know what?
I've seen some amazing parts too.

26:30.714 --> 26:34.583
'Cause sometimes, you're a hard-ass,
you're a hero.

26:34.885 --> 26:37.218
Sometimes, you're a wizard, Harry.

26:40.516 --> 26:41.757
The Council of Wells...

26:43.060 --> 26:44.392
If you wanna make that work,

26:45.187 --> 26:48.180
you have to start treating yourself
with some compassion.

26:50.317 --> 26:51.353
All of yourselves.

26:58.450 --> 27:02.034
Now is the time that simple Harry
has called to insult us even more.

27:02.121 --> 27:04.158
I didn't call to insult, I called to...

27:07.251 --> 27:09.208
- Apologize.
- Apologize...

27:10.379 --> 27:12.416
Apologizing is punishable

27:12.506 --> 27:15.169
by banishment
under Krung the Face-Crusher.

27:15.384 --> 27:19.469
All right, well, that's unfortunate.
Look, I know you guys

27:19.847 --> 27:23.306
prefer to work alone. You don't wanna
work with other people,

27:23.392 --> 27:25.349
you think you're so smart,
you can just push them away,

27:25.435 --> 27:26.892
and I can say that
because I'm one of you,

27:26.979 --> 27:28.971
but if we're going to find our DeVoe,

27:30.149 --> 27:32.391
then we have to work together.
We have to work as...

27:34.194 --> 27:35.856
- Friends.
- Friends...

27:36.864 --> 27:38.526
- With benefits.
- Yeah, no, we're not doing that.

27:38.615 --> 27:39.731
But I'm sure we can

27:39.825 --> 27:42.067
all find something
that we like in one another.

27:42.161 --> 27:44.448
Like, you, Wells 2.0,
you're clearly very...

27:45.497 --> 27:48.865
...resourceful and strong. And you,
you're extremely charismatic.

27:48.959 --> 27:51.576
I'm sure you can recruit
top talent to your research teams.

27:51.795 --> 27:52.876
I'll bring the talent.

27:53.046 --> 27:55.129
Yeah. And you,
<i>Herr</i> Wells, you're very...

27:56.925 --> 27:58.132
- Blunt.
- Yeah.

27:58.218 --> 27:59.675
- Obviously.
- Right.

27:59.761 --> 28:01.297
But, can we just... Can you...

28:01.597 --> 28:04.806
Yeah. Sure. I'm sorry, man.
What I said before about your...

28:05.184 --> 28:06.846
You know, your theory
on the behavioral upbringings

28:06.935 --> 28:09.518
and nano-serial killers
being unchill, that was uncalled for.

28:09.605 --> 28:12.313
I shouldn't have said that.
It's a very groovy theory. Good on you.

28:13.775 --> 28:15.232
Yeah. <i>Danke.</i>

28:15.694 --> 28:18.311
I suppose when I said that your theory

28:18.405 --> 28:21.318
on narcotics in molecular psychiatry

28:21.408 --> 28:23.991
was stupider than a theory
made by tiny babies,

28:24.077 --> 28:25.659
that that was uncalled for also.

28:25.954 --> 28:27.490
- There we go.
<i>- Yeah, man.</i>

28:27.581 --> 28:29.538
I'm digging the whole creepy half-man,

28:29.625 --> 28:31.287
half-metal vibe you got going on.

28:31.376 --> 28:33.333
I just wanna say, all of you...

28:34.504 --> 28:37.121
I really respect the fact
that each one of you,

28:38.800 --> 28:39.836
has two eyes.

28:42.012 --> 28:44.880
Yeah, well, we all agree
on something. That's great. So...

28:44.973 --> 28:48.637
On that note, I hereby reconvene
the Council of Wells.

28:48.727 --> 28:49.968
Now, about our DeVoe...

28:50.395 --> 28:52.762
Well, about DeVoe, perhaps if we were

28:52.856 --> 28:56.349
to combine the Bates-Novick
of our mutant friend here,

28:56.443 --> 28:58.935
with my models
of statistical elimination...

28:59.029 --> 29:01.863
I'll do you one more.
Maybe enhance your elimination model

29:01.949 --> 29:05.363
with a psych profile based
on DeVoe's previous action.

29:05.452 --> 29:06.738
I could whip up a predictive algorithm.

29:06.828 --> 29:07.818
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

29:07.913 --> 29:09.825
Run it through my quantum cerebral chip.

29:10.332 --> 29:11.368
We'll find him in no time.

29:11.959 --> 29:13.666
I'm starting to see
why you called these guys.

29:13.752 --> 29:14.742
Yeah.

29:14.962 --> 29:15.952
All right, gentlemen.

29:17.297 --> 29:18.378
Let's get to work.

29:26.223 --> 29:28.306
If you're here to tell me
how I royally screwed up

29:28.392 --> 29:30.008
letting that little girl get hurt...

29:30.769 --> 29:32.977
Trust me, I know.

29:33.981 --> 29:35.643
<i>I keep feeling all these feelings...</i>

29:36.483 --> 29:40.477
Guilt. Remorse. Heartburn.

29:41.238 --> 29:43.651
Well, I can't help you
with that last one.

29:43.740 --> 29:45.356
But maybe I can help with the rest.

29:47.494 --> 29:48.484
What are all those?

29:48.996 --> 29:49.986
<i>Past cases.</i>

29:50.664 --> 29:51.996
Those were simpler times.

29:53.375 --> 29:56.493
Husband stepping out on wife.
Wife stepping out on husband.

29:56.837 --> 29:59.204
Husband stepping out on wife
and husband.

30:00.716 --> 30:02.048
That one was a little less simple.

30:02.426 --> 30:04.008
Ralph, it was like
you were gonna make a point.

30:04.219 --> 30:05.960
My point is...

30:07.889 --> 30:09.471
When I was a PI, I...

30:10.809 --> 30:13.847
I didn't have to worry
about little girls in hospitals.

30:15.272 --> 30:16.433
I just had to get the dirt.

30:17.065 --> 30:19.773
<i>Whatever happened after that,
I wasn't there to see it.</i>

30:21.069 --> 30:23.937
Now, all I see are people getting hurt,

30:24.239 --> 30:26.276
or about to get hurt.

30:27.034 --> 30:30.323
And for five years, I've got by
without caring about anyone.

30:33.373 --> 30:35.410
Now I have to care about a whole city?

30:37.919 --> 30:39.376
It's a part of the job, Ralph.

30:40.464 --> 30:41.830
Maybe the most important part.

30:42.716 --> 30:43.752
How do you do it?

30:45.260 --> 30:48.128
How do you walk around knowing what
could happen to all those people?

30:49.806 --> 30:52.674
I don't always handle it well.

30:53.894 --> 30:57.558
I've made bad decisions and sometimes
it got more people hurt.

30:58.815 --> 31:00.306
You just gotta do the best you can.

31:01.193 --> 31:03.480
And when that's not enough,
you lean on the people around you.

31:08.241 --> 31:11.405
- You mean you.
- Yeah, me, Ralph.

31:11.495 --> 31:12.986
<i>Look, I brought you into this</i>

31:13.080 --> 31:15.117
because I think that you have
the makings of a hero.

31:15.207 --> 31:18.291
But I would be lying if I said
there won't be hard days.

31:19.169 --> 31:21.286
And when there are,
you'll need someone to turn to.

31:22.672 --> 31:25.540
I can be that person. If you want.

31:27.177 --> 31:28.293
You'd do that for me?

31:28.845 --> 31:32.384
I will make it my personal mission
to protect your heart.

31:34.684 --> 31:38.177
Look, Ralph, I actually think it's
great you're feeling all this stuff.

31:39.022 --> 31:42.390
But don't forget,
that little girl's gonna be okay.

31:43.026 --> 31:44.437
And we got the bad guy.

31:46.113 --> 31:47.103
Yeah.

31:48.907 --> 31:50.239
We got the bad guy.

31:56.164 --> 31:57.200
<i>Don't I know you
from somewhere?</i>

31:57.290 --> 31:58.280
Not likely.

31:58.375 --> 32:01.834
No. I do. I arrested you after
one of those protests last year.

32:01.920 --> 32:03.081
Don't touch me.

32:03.672 --> 32:05.379
Those artifacts are headed
for the museum.

32:05.465 --> 32:06.956
And once the warden's people get here,

32:07.342 --> 32:08.549
you're headed to Iron Heights.

32:28.780 --> 32:31.113
Gentlemen, feast your eyes
on this wonder.

32:31.408 --> 32:34.776
This bad boy's replete with polymer
coated flame resistant armor,

32:35.287 --> 32:38.826
frontal impact deflection panels,
a dual-filter gas mask.

32:39.332 --> 32:43.076
So you don't cry on your own supply.
Especially with this bad boy.

32:44.212 --> 32:45.293
I call it "the onion."

32:46.923 --> 32:47.913
Any questions?

33:19.206 --> 33:21.539
It's time we go collect what's ours.

33:28.131 --> 33:30.418
Joe just called.
Chaytan escaped from CCPD.

33:30.634 --> 33:33.502
Apparently she made a tactical dummy
go full <i>Terminator</i> at the station.

33:33.595 --> 33:34.881
Well, we know where she's going.

33:35.388 --> 33:36.378
The necklace.

33:36.473 --> 33:37.463
The two pieces she stole have been

33:37.557 --> 33:39.389
reunited with the third piece
at the museum.

33:39.476 --> 33:41.388
She has killed for these before,

33:41.478 --> 33:43.390
she will kill anyone that gets
in her way to reclaim them.

33:43.480 --> 33:45.517
It's up to us. Are you ready?

33:46.107 --> 33:48.895
- Well, I was until you said that.
- What are you...

33:48.985 --> 33:52.353
Jeez, Louise, man. What kind of
rousing <i>Braveheart</i> speech was that?

33:52.447 --> 33:53.904
Just put your thing on.

33:53.990 --> 33:55.151
- You wanna help me?
<i>- No.</i>

33:55.242 --> 33:56.699
- It's really tight.
<i>- Hurry up.</i>

34:07.629 --> 34:08.790
Hello, beautiful.

34:23.353 --> 34:26.391
Put it down, Mina.
That belongs in a museum.

34:26.815 --> 34:28.851
- This is a museum.
- Realized that after I said it.

34:29.359 --> 34:32.943
Yes. You keep it here
as part of "American History."

34:33.487 --> 34:36.447
But we're not history.
We are still here.

34:36.908 --> 34:39.150
Still sacred. As is this necklace.

34:40.120 --> 34:42.908
It's going back to the Sioux.
Get out of my way.

34:43.123 --> 34:44.614
Not after the people you've hurt, Mina.

34:45.333 --> 34:46.744
And you're not gonna hurt anyone else.

34:47.085 --> 34:48.074
Is that so?

35:00.432 --> 35:01.889
Don't move.

35:02.475 --> 35:05.263
Their vision is based on movement.

35:09.357 --> 35:10.848
That movie is filled with lies.

35:15.363 --> 35:16.524
We have a T. rex.

35:35.967 --> 35:37.503
What's going on in here?

35:38.011 --> 35:39.798
Stop. I got you.

35:44.768 --> 35:47.101
What you gonna do, superhero?

35:54.444 --> 35:56.401
For the love of Jeff Goldblum, stop!

36:08.249 --> 36:10.206
You're really never gonna
stop chasing me, are you?

36:10.377 --> 36:11.993
No. I'm really not.

36:12.796 --> 36:15.539
Do you have any idea how many things
I can bring to life in this place?

36:16.257 --> 36:17.543
The gargoyles on the roof.

36:17.884 --> 36:20.592
The reliefs carved
into the walls and support pillars.

36:20.679 --> 36:22.921
I can bring this whole place down
in a matter of seconds.

36:23.306 --> 36:24.296
But you won't.

36:24.641 --> 36:27.224
Because there is one thing
you care about more than vengeance.

36:27.394 --> 36:28.384
Isn't there?

36:38.613 --> 36:41.697
I kinda can't believe
you fell for that. Come on.

36:53.086 --> 36:54.076
You almost let her escape.

36:54.713 --> 36:55.999
Well...

36:56.089 --> 36:58.752
I kept hearing your stupid voice
telling me to protect the innocent.

36:59.676 --> 37:01.212
Nice job, rookie.

37:11.396 --> 37:14.059
Good boy. Stay.

37:23.825 --> 37:26.363
All right. Sounds good.
I'll let everybody know.

37:28.621 --> 37:30.613
Hey. That was Joe.

37:30.707 --> 37:33.916
He says that Warden Wolfe has Chaytan
locked up at Iron Heights.

37:34.210 --> 37:36.998
Far, far away from any mannequins,
statues, or...

37:37.088 --> 37:40.877
Effigies. Looked it up.
Still say it sounds kinda dirty,

37:40.967 --> 37:43.710
but I'm not the mayor
of the dictionary, so whatever.

37:44.429 --> 37:46.466
Joe also said that the clean-up crew
at the museum

37:46.556 --> 37:48.297
still hasn't found the Bison necklace.

37:48.767 --> 37:49.803
Huh?

37:50.226 --> 37:52.718
Guess somebody might've mailed it
back to the Sioux reservation.

37:54.647 --> 37:55.808
Somebody?

38:03.698 --> 38:04.905
You gonna yell at me again?

38:07.577 --> 38:09.694
No. Not for this one.

38:15.960 --> 38:17.451
Mina's friends and family...

38:19.839 --> 38:20.829
They've been hurt for too long.

38:21.800 --> 38:24.543
And I'm not sure if you've
heard this saying before, but,

38:25.470 --> 38:27.803
"A superhero's first job
is to protect people."

38:29.891 --> 38:30.881
Wise words.

38:32.936 --> 38:36.020
You want a coffee? On me.
For real, this time.

38:37.941 --> 38:38.977
Thanks, but...

38:42.153 --> 38:43.314
I gotta see about a girl.

38:58.294 --> 39:01.002
Hey, kid. How you doing?

39:01.756 --> 39:03.543
Better. Thanks.

39:04.092 --> 39:05.628
That...

39:06.594 --> 39:07.584
That's awesome.

39:08.096 --> 39:09.678
But I'm really bored.

39:10.223 --> 39:11.213
Yeah.

39:15.895 --> 39:17.056
Do you like balloon animals?

39:32.537 --> 39:33.823
Do a giraffe next.

39:34.706 --> 39:36.993
Okay, but that might take some toes.

39:47.302 --> 39:48.634
Hey. What's going on?

39:48.720 --> 39:51.133
- We think we know who he is.
- According to Harry's friends,

39:51.431 --> 39:54.765
the name we're looking for
is Clifford. Clifford DeVoe.

39:54.851 --> 39:57.184
92% match to our psychological profile.

39:57.270 --> 39:58.681
No other DeVoe comes close.

39:58.771 --> 39:59.978
Guy keeps a low profile.

40:00.064 --> 40:02.101
No social media, no criminal record.

40:02.191 --> 40:03.807
And we know where he's hiding.

40:04.694 --> 40:06.310
43 Hibbard Lane.

40:06.613 --> 40:08.400
Well, if he's as dangerous as you said,

40:08.865 --> 40:10.527
I can call Singh.
We can get a squad over there.

40:11.951 --> 40:12.941
No.

40:14.579 --> 40:15.569
Let's go get him.

40:18.166 --> 40:21.204
Guys, Thawne. Zoom. Savitar.

40:21.920 --> 40:24.833
For once, we actually have a chance
here to get ahead of our enemy.

40:27.175 --> 40:28.461
Let's go get DeVoe.

40:31.930 --> 40:33.341
We're about to have guests.

40:34.557 --> 40:36.549
Then let's be ready to greet them.

40:40.438 --> 40:42.270
- Is this the place?
- This is the one.

40:42.941 --> 40:45.183
- Is everyone set?
- Eye in the sky is a go.

40:45.777 --> 40:47.143
I have eyes on the front door.

40:48.363 --> 40:50.070
Snow and Frost, standing by.

40:50.156 --> 40:51.613
Just give us the word,
and we'll breach in.

40:54.535 --> 40:56.868
What kind of criminal mastermind
has a welcome mat?

41:09.133 --> 41:10.499
Hi, can I help you?

41:11.302 --> 41:14.136
Yes, ma'am.
I'm Detective Joe West, CCPD.

41:14.222 --> 41:15.929
This is Barry Allen, my associate.

41:16.474 --> 41:17.590
Is everything all right?

41:18.184 --> 41:22.929
Yes. We were just hoping to talk
with Clifford DeVoe. Is he here?

41:23.815 --> 41:24.851
Yes, he is.

41:25.566 --> 41:27.432
May I ask what this is about, officers?

41:27.527 --> 41:29.143
We just need to ask him some questions.

41:29.946 --> 41:31.403
Is something wrong?
Is my husband in trouble?

41:32.365 --> 41:34.072
- Your husband?
- No, ma'am.

41:35.368 --> 41:39.112
Clifford. The police are here.
They'd like a word.

41:44.002 --> 41:46.995
Thank you, dear.
Good afternoon, gentlemen.

41:48.131 --> 41:52.125
I'm Clifford DeVoe.
How may I be of help?
