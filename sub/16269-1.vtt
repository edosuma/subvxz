01:06.500 --> 01:10.500
I suppose we could just fire him.

01:48.800 --> 01:51.771
Of course, we'll have to give him
three months' notice.

01:51.780 --> 01:53.490
Stuff and nonsense.
Leave it to me.

01:53.537 --> 01:57.300
I'll talk to the chairman and insist
on Mr Bean's immediate dismissal.

01:57.311 --> 01:59.650
Now, then, back to the agenda.

01:59.660 --> 02:02.990
The Grierson Gallery of California
has recently received

02:03.000 --> 02:06.300
a private donation
of 50 million dollars

02:06.301 --> 02:09.375
to spend on buying Whistler's
portrait of his mother

02:09.417 --> 02:11.977
from the Musée D'Orsay in Paris.

02:12.017 --> 02:15.080
It is quite simply,
the most historic purchase

02:15.090 --> 02:18.528
made by an American gallery
this century.

02:22.529 --> 02:24.000
It's as simple as this...

02:24.010 --> 02:26.200
The greatest painting ever
by an American artist

02:26.210 --> 02:28.972
is returning at last to America.

02:29.200 --> 02:33.008
From now on Whistler's Mother
lives right here in Los Angeles

02:33.055 --> 02:34.613
where she belongs!

02:34.655 --> 02:36.296
When will we actually see her?

02:36.300 --> 02:39.050
The unveiling will be in about two weeks.
And you're all invited!

02:41.300 --> 02:44.800
They've asked us to send a scholar
of great weight and substance,

02:44.850 --> 02:46.650
to preside over the ceremony

02:46.654 --> 02:51.172
and stay on for a couple of months
of lectures and seminars.

02:51.200 --> 02:52.500
Dr Rosenblum...

02:52.600 --> 02:54.300
Dr Cutler...

02:54.400 --> 02:59.172
You both hold high claim
on this great honour.

03:01.000 --> 03:04.650
- The chairman's here, sir.
- Excellent. Send him in.

03:04.660 --> 03:07.330
Oh, run and fetch Mr Bean, will you?

03:07.350 --> 03:10.600
- We're about to fire him.
- Marvellous.

03:10.610 --> 03:16.090
Yes. Mr Bean is the worst employee
in the gallery's history.

03:55.551 --> 03:56.989
Good afternoon, sir.

03:58.811 --> 04:00.291
Sit down. Sit down.

04:01.000 --> 04:04.100
Now. Before moving on
to the major business of the day,

04:04.111 --> 04:07.111
I should like to broach
the question of Mr Bean.

04:07.123 --> 04:09.203
Now, Mr Bean has worked
for us for many years.

04:09.350 --> 04:11.864
And will for many years to come.

04:12.511 --> 04:14.420
I employed this
splendid young man

04:14.425 --> 04:16.800
when I was doing your job, Charles,

04:16.899 --> 04:20.207
and you can have my resignation
if you go anywhere near him.

05:18.006 --> 05:19.858
He's a fine young fellow.

05:20.006 --> 05:22.082
Absolutely. Quite right.

05:23.867 --> 05:25.963
Very well. Moving on...
Erm...

05:27.086 --> 05:29.043
The Grierson Gallery
of California

05:29.087 --> 05:32.045
needs a representative
of our great gallery.

05:32.287 --> 05:35.919
They are looking for a scholar
of a very high standing.

05:35.965 --> 05:39.799
I have therefore decided
to recommend for the post...

05:39.845 --> 05:44.159
and the three months
sabbatical that goes with it...

05:44.207 --> 05:46.002
that splendid employee...

05:47.005 --> 05:48.154
Mr Bean!

05:50.245 --> 05:51.474
Yes!

05:52.125 --> 05:54.397
- All those in favour?
- Yes!

05:54.444 --> 05:55.923
Excellent! Carried.

05:57.000 --> 06:00.000
Our loss...
is America's gain.

06:01.605 --> 06:05.500
David, I got a letter from
the Royal National Gallery...

06:05.534 --> 06:07.534
They're recommanding
a guy called Bean

06:07.584 --> 06:08.888
...to represent them.

06:09.224 --> 06:12.078
Bean?
I can't say I've heard of him.

06:12.124 --> 06:14.843
The letter's signed by
Drs Rosenblum and Cutler.

06:14.884 --> 06:16.282
Well, that's impressive.

06:16.324 --> 06:18.800
They say - 'he's a man
whose incontrovertible genius

06:18.823 --> 06:20.803
...dwarfs our own meagre talents.'

06:20.844 --> 06:22.436
Rosenblum and Cutler said that?

06:22.484 --> 06:25.222
Well, you asked for England's top man.
I do believe I delivered him.

06:25.333 --> 06:27.036
It certainly sounds like it.

06:27.163 --> 06:29.240
However, before we confirm,

06:29.283 --> 06:32.241
Bernice here still feels that
we'd get more media attention

06:32.383 --> 06:35.403
if we had someone from, let's say,
the entertainment industry.

06:35.444 --> 06:40.000
I genuinely believe that
we could get Jon Bon Jovi.

06:40.563 --> 06:42.276
Jon Bon Jovi?

06:42.364 --> 06:45.074
- To unveil Whistler's Mother?
- Yes.

06:46.643 --> 06:48.510
I have nothing
against Jon Bon Jovi.

06:48.662 --> 06:51.396
The man has had two great
hairstyles in the last ten years,

06:51.443 --> 06:53.861
which is an achievement
not to be sniffed at.

06:53.902 --> 06:57.668
But, so far as I know,
Mr Jovi knows absolutely nothing

06:57.702 --> 06:59.514
about 19th Century
Impressionism.

06:59.561 --> 07:01.718
Certainly hasn't mention it
in any of his recent songs.

07:01.762 --> 07:05.278
- No, but David...
- This is not a rock video.

07:05.321 --> 07:08.438
This is a great and
serious work of art,

07:08.481 --> 07:11.517
and Dr Bean will give
the occasion depth and dignity.

07:13.602 --> 07:15.353
You're right. We go with Bean.

07:15.401 --> 07:18.881
- But, George...
- No, no. David's our curator.

07:18.992 --> 07:20.092
This is David's call.

07:20.141 --> 07:22.630
It's his decision,
his responsibility,

07:22.681 --> 07:25.070
ultimately, his neck.

07:26.740 --> 07:30.552
- And where do you want him to stay?
- I have a rather interesting idea.

07:30.599 --> 07:32.351
Here?

07:32.400 --> 07:35.738
In our house,
for two months?

07:35.780 --> 07:39.551
Oh-ho, David. What?... Suddently
there's no hotels in Los Angeles?

07:39.600 --> 07:42.017
Okay. We don't need to get excited here.
I just thought, you know...

07:42.160 --> 07:45.058
This is the Royal National Gallery
of England's top man.

07:45.100 --> 07:47.549
I thought you'd be very excited
to have around...

07:47.599 --> 07:49.213
to learn from, and talk to...
- Uh-huh...

07:49.259 --> 07:51.738
...so do we know anything
about our new best friend?

07:51.750 --> 07:53.100
No. But I think they
would have mentioned it

07:53.111 --> 07:55.349
if he was a notorious
serial killer!

07:55.359 --> 07:58.488
Are you feeling lucky, punk?

07:59.000 --> 08:02.000
- David, you know, we have
an expression in this country...

08:02.001 --> 08:04.000
it says: "over my dead body"!
- Ali...

08:04.100 --> 08:07.392
I'd like to put it on the table
right here and now!

08:07.400 --> 08:09.553
This is a once-in-a-lifetime
opportunity.

08:09.597 --> 08:12.031
It could be seriously
great for the kids.

08:12.077 --> 08:13.491
You're kidding?!

08:13.537 --> 08:16.100
C'mon...
It's gonna be great!

08:16.111 --> 08:17.618
Let's say there is a chart

08:17.718 --> 08:20.809
of the most intelligent people
you've ever met in your life.

08:20.847 --> 08:23.771
Well, at number one,
with a bullet, is Dr Bean.

08:23.980 --> 08:26.393
Kevin, you know how sometimes you
ask me questions that I can't answer.

08:26.437 --> 08:28.290
Like, "What is an
intra-uterine device?"

08:28.337 --> 08:31.150
- Erm, well, I think more like,
"What's the meaning of life?"

08:31.175 --> 08:34.299
- I never asked you that.
- It's fine. That doesn't matter!

08:34.320 --> 08:38.789
What I am saying here, is that
Dr Bean is a very remarkable man.

08:39.299 --> 08:41.993
Hey, hey. For all you know,
he could be very cute.

08:43.799 --> 08:46.072
Oh come on...
The guy is gonna be a creep!

08:46.100 --> 08:47.800
All Englishmen are ugly.

08:47.810 --> 08:50.074
I just look at Prince Charles
and weep.

08:50.116 --> 08:52.222
Ok, so he's gonna look
like Meat Loaf's butt.

08:52.233 --> 08:54.000
Yeah, and that's
if we get lucky.

08:54.010 --> 08:56.555
Jennifer, no one is
asking you to marry him.

08:56.600 --> 08:59.100
You know... I don't know why
we have this family conferences

08:59.111 --> 09:00.831
if dad's aleady made up his mind.

09:00.880 --> 09:02.100
Perceptive child.

09:02.110 --> 09:03.300
Hey, what's wrong
with Meat Loaf's butt?

09:03.356 --> 09:05.668
Oh come on everybody,
it's gonna be great.

09:05.916 --> 09:08.747
Dr Bean is a genius
of the very highest order.

09:09.274 --> 09:11.869
Good evening.

09:11.915 --> 09:15.351
No, sir. You're in fact in First Class.

09:15.395 --> 09:16.874
Good evening.

09:28.700 --> 09:31.600
Good evening, sir.
May I take your coat?

09:31.700 --> 09:32.900
Thank you.

10:08.551 --> 10:13.910
- Good. Simple poster. Nice and big.
- Its actual size. A bargain at $9.99.

10:13.953 --> 10:15.545
- Spencer?
- Yes, sir.

10:17.250 --> 10:18.700
Bath towel.

10:18.888 --> 10:21.583
Mmm... yeah! Pushing your luck
a little here, Walter.

10:21.631 --> 10:23.587
It'll sell.

10:28.991 --> 10:30.424
It's Whistler's Sister.

10:30.471 --> 10:31.586
You are kidding.

10:31.590 --> 10:35.705
No, sir. We have a range
for every member of the family.

10:35.752 --> 10:38.345
Whistler's Mother's cookies.
Chocolate chip.

10:38.391 --> 10:40.346
Whistler's Father's beer mug.

10:41.300 --> 10:43.584
And here's a really cute one
for the younger-brother range:

10:43.600 --> 10:45.784
Whistler's whistle.
You just blow up her ass.

10:45.800 --> 10:47.500
- Yeah. I.. I...
- Here, try.

10:52.900 --> 10:55.541
Mommy, I don't feel well.

11:16.300 --> 11:20.056
I think I'm gonna be sick.

11:35.200 --> 11:36.900
Just here, sir.

11:38.000 --> 11:40.200
<i>Welcome to Los Angeles
International Airport</i>

11:40.250 --> 11:44.000
<i>Do not leave baggage or
other items unattended.</i>

11:45.600 --> 11:46.500
Hey

11:47.147 --> 11:48.459
Any second now...

11:48.460 --> 11:51.060
I think we're looking for
a Brad Pitt look-alike.

12:31.000 --> 12:32.876
Police!

12:33.100 --> 12:35.000
Get on him now!
Move it!

12:35.100 --> 12:38.039
Police, come on, watch it, watch it!
Everybody out of the way!

12:38.585 --> 12:42.476
In pursuit of a 4-15: male with a gun
heading into Zone 10, Terminal 2!

12:42.484 --> 12:43.500
Get your people over here, now!

12:43.550 --> 12:44.900
Get out of the way,
get out of the way!

12:45.000 --> 12:47.558
Move it!
Move... move... move!

12:47.959 --> 12:49.959
Police coming through.
Go!

12:50.000 --> 12:52.454
Lady, watch it!
Move!

12:52.623 --> 12:54.500
There he is!

12:54.901 --> 12:55.501
Move, move, move!

12:56.500 --> 12:57.301
Police!

12:57.303 --> 13:00.577
Everyone on the floor! Now!

13:01.400 --> 13:04.773
- Not you, sweetie.
- Oh, right.

13:08.777 --> 13:10.888
Carefully take out your weapon,

13:10.900 --> 13:13.815
holding the butt
with two fingers only!

13:13.862 --> 13:19.016
Slowly place it on the floor
and take three steps back.

13:40.861 --> 13:44.216
- What is this?
- I don't know. Weird.

14:06.440 --> 14:07.858
Mr Bean,

14:07.900 --> 14:10.370
are you presently on
any kind of medication?

14:11.020 --> 14:13.579
Not that I know of.

14:13.600 --> 14:17.700
Well, you can
certainly use some.

14:28.858 --> 14:30.321
So Doctor...

14:31.139 --> 14:32.256
Bean.

14:32.400 --> 14:33.817
Yes, okay, Dr Bean.

14:34.000 --> 14:37.819
Well, you...you made it.

14:38.500 --> 14:41.000
Nice flight?

14:46.400 --> 14:49.134
Well, this is Kevin.
- Ah...

14:49.500 --> 14:53.330
And this is Jennifer. She's been
very excited about meeting you.

14:53.333 --> 14:55.853
My wife, Alison.

14:59.377 --> 15:02.234
David, could I have the tiniest
talk with you in the kitchen?

15:02.235 --> 15:05.500
All right. Yeah.
We just gotta...

15:09.157 --> 15:12.571
I appreciate that on first viewing
he seems a little eccentric.

15:12.600 --> 15:16.300
David, there are Martians who have
been exiled from Mars for looking weird

15:16.303 --> 15:17.999
who look less weird
than this guy.

15:18.000 --> 15:21.249
- He has an original quality, but every time...
- He goes. Today.

15:32.000 --> 15:34.550
Wow... That was amazing!

15:34.555 --> 15:36.490
It's really cool!

15:36.500 --> 15:38.572
Hey, can you do this?

15:40.955 --> 15:43.810
No, but I can do this.

15:45.000 --> 15:48.300
Neat, wow.
How do you do that?

15:48.303 --> 15:49.750
Magic.

15:49.755 --> 15:50.555
- I'll do it.
- Okay...

15:50.560 --> 15:52.750
- So you're gonna tell him? Today?
- Yes, yes. Today.

15:52.755 --> 15:55.555
- Today seems like a good day.
- Good.

16:16.666 --> 16:20.000
Well, sir. An unorthodox start.

16:20.300 --> 16:23.200
I guess I never expected things
with a man of your calibre

16:23.400 --> 16:26.209
to be normal.

16:27.000 --> 16:29.700
I gotta confess... I never
actually read anything you've written.

16:30.000 --> 16:33.500
Tell me doctor... what exactly
is your position at the gallery?

16:35.500 --> 16:40.571
I sit in the corner
and look at the paintings.

16:40.613 --> 16:43.409
Ah!... That is brilliant!

16:43.800 --> 16:45.900
If only more scholars
would do that - you know,

16:46.000 --> 16:47.300
just sit and look.

16:47.400 --> 16:50.300
You know... not lecture,
and write and argue,

16:50.332 --> 16:52.900
just sit and look at
the paintings themselves.

16:53.000 --> 16:55.325
Now that is brilliant!
Yeah.

17:01.651 --> 17:04.243
- Morning, Elmer.
- Good morning, sir.

17:04.329 --> 17:06.480
Dr Bean.

17:07.000 --> 17:09.289
If you'd like to sign in, sir.

17:13.829 --> 17:17.000
Thank you. Welcome
to the Grierson Dr Bean.

17:22.211 --> 17:24.200
Welcome to my world.

17:28.400 --> 17:30.600
We're expected in
Grierson's office at 9am.

17:30.610 --> 17:33.300
Now this is a man who does not
like to be kept waiting, so if you...

17:33.333 --> 17:37.300
- Do you mind if I...?
- Oh yeah. Okay, absolutely. You bet.

17:37.500 --> 17:40.000
All right...

19:27.200 --> 19:30.998
Doctor, we should make a move.
We're very late.

19:47.801 --> 19:52.670
Oh, we... Doctor, we... if you...
when you're ready... Okay.

19:59.241 --> 20:01.311
Ah, David, finally.

20:03.500 --> 20:05.600
And this must be our professor
from across the sea.

20:05.666 --> 20:09.992
- Yes. George Grierson, this is Dr Bean.
- I'm delighted, Doctor.

20:10.000 --> 20:12.999
- Actually, I'm not...
- Dr Bean? Can we get a photo, sir?

20:13.000 --> 20:13.888
Right there.

20:13.900 --> 20:16.477
We've heard a great deal
about you Doctor.

20:16.520 --> 20:18.876
We expect a great deal of you.

20:19.500 --> 20:21.670
And this is Bernice,
in charge of PR.

20:21.675 --> 20:23.300
An absolute honour, Doctor.

20:23.310 --> 20:27.000
All right, thank you. And Walter Huntley,
our merchandise manager.

20:27.500 --> 20:28.670
Nice to meet you.

20:28.720 --> 20:31.519
Moving along...
Take a seat, Doctor.

20:31.550 --> 20:36.000
Here, let me take that old thing.
This is very out-of-date.

20:36.330 --> 20:37.250
Thank you.

20:37.252 --> 20:42.594
Before we settle in, you might
wanna feast your eyes on these.

20:54.000 --> 20:55.700
Well, I'll be honest with you, Bean.

20:55.710 --> 20:58.500
- I like this.
- It's beautiful, sir.

20:58.501 --> 21:00.000
I think... it is. Yeah.

21:01.300 --> 21:03.553
- Over here.
- Okay.

21:13.318 --> 21:16.070
It's a lovely green there.

21:16.800 --> 21:19.388
- Good, good. Down to business.
- Okay

21:20.000 --> 21:23.749
I've asked Bernice to run through
the order of events for the opening

21:23.798 --> 21:25.912
Dr Bean, would you like to join us?

21:27.200 --> 21:29.900
No, no, I'll just...

21:30.598 --> 21:32.348
Very well,

21:32.500 --> 21:33.900
Bernice?

21:34.000 --> 21:36.911
Now, you will know that anything
pertaining to special media requirements

21:36.957 --> 21:39.629
is prefixed with an asterisk.

21:39.676 --> 21:43.140
i.e. glossy stills requested by
some of the favored weeklies,

21:43.150 --> 21:44.300
that sort of thing.

21:44.350 --> 21:45.350
Right

21:45.400 --> 21:48.444
So, the big day unfolds as follows:

21:48.500 --> 21:50.444
our generous benefactor,
General Newton

21:50.450 --> 21:53.000
will be arriving at 10 AM
to meet the members of the staff

21:53.110 --> 21:56.000
then at 10:30 we'll have
the unveiling of the picture

21:56.100 --> 21:58.714
Now this will be in front
of all press and media.

21:58.755 --> 22:02.299
Walter, I'm assuming all this merchandising
is gonna be made available?

22:02.300 --> 22:05.100
Oh, absolutely. From fridge magnets
to frisbees, we'll be ready.

22:05.111 --> 22:07.500
So, it will probably be at about 11 AM

22:07.555 --> 22:11.063
when the stage
is set for Dr Bean.

22:11.600 --> 22:14.112
Yes, right, we really...

22:14.154 --> 22:17.385
We should bring in
the Doctor here.

22:24.914 --> 22:26.711
Dr Bean?

22:37.000 --> 22:41.100
Doctor, we've inspected
the schedule, and...

22:41.140 --> 22:44.791
if you would just look at yours
right over there at your convenience?

22:44.832 --> 22:46.900
The General should be arriving at 10 AM

22:47.000 --> 22:49.490
and he'll unveil
the picture at 10.30.

22:49.500 --> 22:53.500
So at about eleven o'clock
we should be ready for your speech.

22:54.700 --> 22:59.500
Yes, and I think 20 minutes
should be long enough.

22:59.900 --> 23:01.555
- Don't you, Bernice?
- Absolutely.

23:01.575 --> 23:03.550
I know you could fill hours, Doctor,

23:03.565 --> 23:06.965
but for the press, it would be best
if you could to keep it quite light.

23:07.000 --> 23:10.400
Maybe throw in some anecdotes about
the actual painting of the picture,

23:10.500 --> 23:13.800
and explain why it is considered
America's greatest painting.

23:13.900 --> 23:15.100
Huh?

23:16.400 --> 23:20.498
Is that going to be enough,
Doctor, 20 minutes?

23:23.400 --> 23:25.200
Well, dear friends,
if you'll excuse me,

23:25.222 --> 23:26.888
I have a lunch with the Mayor.

23:26.900 --> 23:29.700
Not the kind of thing I like,
but duty calls.

23:29.750 --> 23:32.123
Well Doctor, it's good to meet you.

23:32.200 --> 23:34.700
It's a complex experience.

23:35.000 --> 23:36.969
Enjoy your stay with David.

23:37.000 --> 23:39.499
They're simple people, but warm.

23:39.500 --> 23:42.000
David, if I may I have
just a private word?

23:42.060 --> 23:45.555
Okay. I tell you. Why don't you wait
for me back at the new acquisitions.

23:45.567 --> 23:48.010
I'll join you shortly. Yeah.

23:49.900 --> 23:50.900
Yes, sir?

23:54.100 --> 23:55.888
He's a genius, right?

23:55.900 --> 23:59.999
- Yeah, he's eccentric, but...
- Yes!

24:02.938 --> 24:05.327
The unveiling of
Whistler's Mother

24:05.378 --> 24:09.416
is the most important thing
to ever happen to this gallery.

24:09.700 --> 24:12.292
And Dr Bean was your choice.

24:12.338 --> 24:16.968
Yes, I understand that.
Thank you, sir.

24:32.000 --> 24:35.000
Dr Bean, when we get home,
I wonder...

24:35.777 --> 24:38.368
...when we get home,
I wonder if you would mind

24:38.416 --> 24:40.486
giving me a moment
with my wife?

24:40.536 --> 24:43.255
There's a little something
we need to work out.

24:43.296 --> 24:44.729
No problem.

24:54.300 --> 24:57.965
Yeah, I think... just wait
in here would be good.

24:58.015 --> 24:59.700
Oh, just ignore that.

24:59.725 --> 25:04.200
Her mother gave it to us.
Huge sentimental value, you know, so...

25:04.400 --> 25:05.969
Just make yourself at home.

25:06.014 --> 25:09.051
I'll be just a couple
of minutes with Alison.

25:14.600 --> 25:16.100
Oh, doctor...

25:16.114 --> 25:17.800
I would actually not do that.

25:17.900 --> 25:20.042
That's a limited edition.

25:20.094 --> 25:21.800
It's that it's delicate, so if you...

25:21.854 --> 25:24.654
or, yeah, if...
put it there would be good.

25:24.700 --> 25:26.700
Yeah. Okay, that's... all right.

25:32.500 --> 25:35.000
- Hi.
- Hi!

25:35.350 --> 25:36.523
No dr. Bean?

25:36.524 --> 25:42.569
- Well, actually, no, he is still here, but let me...
- Jennifer, Kevin, Plan B!

25:42.612 --> 25:44.850
You have luggage packed? What is Plan B?

25:44.900 --> 25:48.767
Plan B is: If you haven't gotten rid of dr.Bean,
we go to Grandma's.

25:48.777 --> 25:50.800
I can't believe you...
Screwed up again, huh, Dad?

25:50.808 --> 25:53.000
Oh, come on, there was no time
to raise the subject!

25:53.023 --> 25:57.000
- Kevin, start the car, would you, sweetie?
- Oh, Ali, wait a second and look...

25:57.012 --> 26:00.999
No, you look, David, my darling,
I have asked very little from you,

26:01.012 --> 26:03.001
but I did ask you
to get rid of dr. Bean.

26:03.052 --> 26:06.567
and you have made your choice.
So you two can stay here

26:06.572 --> 26:08.995
and really come to grips
with post-modernism,

26:09.002 --> 26:11.410
but I am taking our children
to my mother's.

26:11.411 --> 26:16.802
Just give him one last chance.
Just one.

26:16.841 --> 26:17.886
Please.

26:20.100 --> 26:21.782
Okay.

26:22.000 --> 26:23.400
- Okay.
- Thank you.

26:23.405 --> 26:26.564
- All right.
- Thanks. Once you get to know him,

26:26.611 --> 26:29.000
I think you're gonna...
- David, don't.

26:33.750 --> 26:36.644
- Hello, Doctor.
- Hello.

26:38.700 --> 26:41.000
No, Doctor, that's not for the TV.
That's for the...

26:55.570 --> 26:59.900
Yeah... Well...

27:00.000 --> 27:02.000
There they go.

27:07.800 --> 27:11.700
Well, Doctor, we've got
the whole weekend together.

27:12.100 --> 27:15.846
Yeah, get to know
each other, and...

27:17.367 --> 27:20.227
I was thinking tomorrow
we might really do LA.

27:20.277 --> 27:22.300
There's the Gallery of
American Indian Art.

27:22.333 --> 27:24.500
There's the California State Gallery...

27:24.550 --> 27:26.590
There's actually this new place,
the Rabowitz,

27:26.600 --> 27:31.000
which is kind of 'the' place
for abstract expressionism.

27:31.900 --> 27:34.900
Does that sound good to you?

27:35.727 --> 27:38.077
Maybe you have something else in mind?

28:42.920 --> 28:46.001
Incredible. You set?

28:46.500 --> 28:49.000
<i>Thank you for taking the Ride of Doom.</i>

28:54.000 --> 28:55.600
Why don’t you get another ticket?

28:55.650 --> 28:58.955
Could be more fun
second time round.

29:15.600 --> 29:17.200
Okay.

29:20.000 --> 29:22.900
Brace yourself!

29:37.450 --> 29:39.195
Help. Help!

30:46.680 --> 30:48.712
He's a genius, huh?

30:48.758 --> 30:50.748
That's what they tell me.

30:58.277 --> 31:02.277
Well, he looks like
a fruitcake to me.

31:04.000 --> 31:06.834
Are you willing to take
responsibility for his actions?

31:10.555 --> 31:12.350
Well, you're a braver man than me,

31:12.500 --> 31:16.500
and I single-handedly take on gangs
armed with AK-47s.

31:18.321 --> 31:19.321
Get him out of here.

31:19.333 --> 31:22.313
Tell him his is a butt
I would dearly love to kick,

31:23.275 --> 31:25.500
And the next time, I will.

31:29.200 --> 31:34.303
Doctor, there is something
we have to talk about.

31:35.000 --> 31:39.500
and I don't quite know
how to put this.

31:39.800 --> 31:42.600
What I am concerned about is…

31:42.650 --> 31:46.720
Whoever that is,
I am getting rid of them.

31:47.970 --> 31:52.755
- There he is!
- David, sorry we're late.

31:55.355 --> 31:58.000
The traffic, o, terrible. You couldn’t believe.
- Ohh... it's beautiful!

31:58.010 --> 32:00.490
- Every day, it gets worse and worse.
- Wait... It's just the way she ads...

32:00.500 --> 32:02.490
- It's the green...
- Why is there nobody in control?

32:02.500 --> 32:06.490
- No, it's the yellow. It's just...
- ...he doesn't have to drive.

32:06.500 --> 32:08.190
Well, where is Alison?

32:08.200 --> 32:11.300
Well, I've got some bad news
and some good news.

32:11.900 --> 32:15.100
The bad news is that Alison
has had to go visit her mum,

32:15.150 --> 32:17.900
who, well, is not well.

32:17.910 --> 32:19.690
- That's too bad.
- Gee, the poor thing.

32:19.700 --> 32:20.788
Sorry to hear that, David.

32:20.800 --> 32:24.600
The good news is that
Dr Bean and I will be cooking.

32:25.000 --> 32:28.500
- Sure that's good news...?
- Well, of course it is.

32:29.000 --> 32:31.888
All the greatest chefs in the world are men.

32:32.000 --> 32:35.000
So, what's on the menu, maestro?

32:35.000 --> 32:37.421
How could I forget?

32:38.000 --> 32:40.904
What the hell are we
going to give them?

32:41.500 --> 32:44.900
Yes, I think they may be expecting
something slightly more formal.

32:48.200 --> 32:50.621
An onion? Just on its own?

32:52.800 --> 32:56.500
No, no, don’t be ridiculous.
That's for Thanksgiving. Alison would kill me.

32:56.900 --> 32:58.900
There must be something else.

33:00.800 --> 33:02.500
Have you ever cooked one of these before?

33:02.550 --> 33:04.490
Oh, yes.

33:04.500 --> 33:07.100
But anyway, it would take like five hours, right?

33:07.800 --> 33:10.500
Not necessarily.

33:19.100 --> 33:23.500
- What do you think? 20 minutes?
- I... I don't know?

33:24.600 --> 33:26.350
You’re sure this is gonna work?

33:26.355 --> 33:27.250
Okay, you're the chef.

33:27.255 --> 33:31.459
Just put on some vegetables
and come and say hello.

33:38.900 --> 33:44.505
Maestro, my tastebuds are
positively tingling with anticipation.

33:51.200 --> 33:52.800
No, thanks.

33:53.700 --> 33:57.150
I think we’ll pass on the appetizer.

33:58.000 --> 34:01.450
So, Bean. Big day Tuesday.

34:01.500 --> 34:04.182
Your big day, my big day.

34:05.000 --> 34:07.000
I have a question for you.

34:12.900 --> 34:16.199
He's very attentive to details.

34:16.699 --> 34:19.018
Everything must be... just so.

34:36.900 --> 34:40.400
Bean, I think we need
to be honest with each other.

34:40.500 --> 34:43.900
I cannot deny
that over the last days

34:44.000 --> 34:48.000
some suspicions have begun
to gather in my mind.

34:48.199 --> 34:53.699
And I would just like to ask you
some direct questions, okay?

34:54.199 --> 35:00.000
Number one: are you a Doctor?

35:05.200 --> 35:07.223
No.

35:09.200 --> 35:11.000
Number two:

35:11.400 --> 35:15.000
Do you know anything about art?

35:21.400 --> 35:23.980
Well... just for instance here,

35:26.200 --> 35:30.259
Was Leonardo da Vinci
an American basketball player?

35:41.300 --> 35:42.550
Yes.

35:55.100 --> 35:57.150
- Hi, Dad.
- Hi, Dad.

35:57.200 --> 35:58.200
Hello, Doctor.

35:58.220 --> 36:01.250
- Bye, Dad.
- Bye, Dad.

37:06.500 --> 37:09.900
Hallo? Mr Grierson, yes.

37:09.950 --> 37:12.000
He's in the shower with me.

37:12.050 --> 37:14.652
Would you give me…

37:15.000 --> 37:17.000
Yes, hello Mr Grierson.

37:17.800 --> 37:19.973
Ah, no-no, you must have misunderstood him,

37:20.137 --> 37:22.970
What can I?... She is?

37:23.050 --> 37:25.000
Oh, thank you for calling me.

37:25.050 --> 37:28.050
- Yes, okay. Goodbye.
- Bye.

37:33.420 --> 37:34.355
I can’t believe it...

37:34.360 --> 37:37.500
Whistler's Mother has
actually arrived in America.

37:37.550 --> 37:39.600
Now, listen, I am begging you

37:39.650 --> 37:42.700
as a man whose entire professional
career depends on you,

37:42.750 --> 37:45.646
behave rationally today.

37:48.000 --> 37:50.127
There is no God.

38:17.700 --> 38:20.000
What do you think?

38:22.250 --> 38:24.700
Nice frame.

38:24.750 --> 38:26.686
She's magnificent.

38:27.500 --> 38:32.130
David, well done.
Worth every bright green buck.

38:32.100 --> 38:34.733
She's something else, isn't she?

38:36.400 --> 38:37.990
All right folks, enjoy her while you can.

38:38.000 --> 38:39.490
After this morning, we lock her away

38:39.500 --> 38:43.480
until the guy who paid
$50 million for her turns up.

38:43.500 --> 38:47.150
- And, Elmer, I believe we have a security meeting.
- That's right, Sir.

38:47.200 --> 38:50.500
And... Oh, this is your key
to the encasement system.

38:51.000 --> 38:52.700
There are only two -
I have the other one.

38:52.800 --> 38:57.327
So, if the painting turns up missing,
I'll know where to come.

38:57.800 --> 39:00.200
And if you could all join me
at the security console?

39:00.250 --> 39:01.500
Doctor, why don't you
just stay here?

39:01.570 --> 39:06.402
Maybe a look at the real thing
will inspire you for your speech.

39:08.000 --> 39:11.500
Just stay here. Don't leave
this room till I get back, okay?

39:26.600 --> 39:30.799
This chart maps all the security
elements for the big day.

39:30.800 --> 39:33.700
And as usual in these circumstances,
I’ve given the operation a code name,

39:33.750 --> 39:36.359
which is
"Operation Whistler's Mother".

39:36.410 --> 39:39.766
It's not a snazzy title,
but I think it works.

40:52.260 --> 40:53.880
Fear not, gentlemen.

40:53.900 --> 40:56.560
With the system we've put in here,
nothing'll touch that painting,

40:56.565 --> 41:00.000
short of an earthquake
that brings down the whole gallery

42:19.100 --> 42:23.888
Once we’ve gotten the general safely inside,
the key figure, security-wise, will be dr. Bean.

42:23.900 --> 42:25.100
We've gotta protect the painting

42:25.110 --> 42:27.154
without getting into the doctor's way.

44:29.395 --> 44:32.072
Seems to be a problem with the...

44:35.500 --> 44:37.000
door.

44:52.100 --> 44:54.709
Where's the picture gone?

44:59.613 --> 45:01.426
What, what, what?

45:11.900 --> 45:14.000
Oh, Jesus! Oh, God! Oh...

45:14.003 --> 45:16.400
Oh, Jesus, God! Oh, Mary!

45:16.440 --> 45:19.830
Mother of Jesus!
Jesus of Nazareth!

45:24.000 --> 45:24.900
Wait a minute...

45:24.901 --> 45:26.991
Why am I worrying about this?
You did it!

45:27.000 --> 45:30.267
All I have to do is go out and
tell them what happened!

45:30.500 --> 45:33.850
Perfect! Then they'll say, "Well,
who left him alone with the picture?"

45:33.880 --> 45:35.330
And I say, "Me"!

45:35.340 --> 45:37.789
Then they say, "Well, you're fired."
I say, "Fine!"

45:37.800 --> 45:40.190
No, no, no... Then they say
"Firing is not enough..."

45:39.231 --> 45:41.900
"Let's prosecute you for negligence."

45:41.910 --> 45:43.150
Then I go to jail...

45:43.160 --> 45:45.611
My wife leaves me, my daughter
becomes a prostitute.

45:45.651 --> 45:49.700
I wind up on Death Row,
sharing a cell with Butch McDick!

45:49.711 --> 45:51.822
All right, calm down.
I just gotta calm down.

45:51.871 --> 45:55.227
Okay, okay, give me one more
look at the painting.

45:57.050 --> 46:00.070
Oh, God! Oh, God! God! God!...

46:00.077 --> 46:03.599
...which renders the underground
ventilation ducts completely secure.

46:03.600 --> 46:06.800
- Yes, well, that's good to know.
- Thank you, sir.

46:28.300 --> 46:30.698
Hey, do you drink, Bean?

46:30.748 --> 46:33.547
- No.
- Good. Neither do I.

46:50.400 --> 46:52.000
Bean...

47:04.600 --> 47:06.458
Carry on.

47:10.000 --> 47:13.260
You wanna know what
the reality of the situation is?

47:13.261 --> 47:16.700
Okay,... this is it:

47:16.770 --> 47:20.417
Because you moved into my house,
my wife has moved out.

47:20.550 --> 47:24.400
Yes, she did... She might have
moved out anyway, but...

47:24.500 --> 47:29.520
That is one... point one.
Point two...

47:29.525 --> 47:32.390
I've given my life to art.

47:32.400 --> 47:36.934
And from here on in, the only art
I will get anywhere near

47:36.950 --> 47:39.784
are pictures I draw
on the pavement,

47:39.790 --> 47:43.454
hoping passers-by will
throw nickels in my hat.

47:43.624 --> 47:46.298
I guess the long and the short of it...

47:47.300 --> 47:48.975
I wish I'd never been born.

48:02.500 --> 48:05.500
Yesterday,

48:06.060 --> 48:12.252
All my troubles...
seemed so far away,

48:13.250 --> 48:18.700
Now it looks as though
they're here to stay.

48:18.710 --> 48:22.222
...I believe in...

48:22.223 --> 48:24.898
...yesterday.

48:25.100 --> 48:26.888
Suddenly,

48:26.900 --> 48:31.500
I'm not half the man
I used to be.

48:31.777 --> 48:37.174
There's a shadow
hanging over me...

48:37.180 --> 48:39.400
I believe

48:39.410 --> 48:43.100
in yesterday...

48:43.150 --> 48:46.000
Suddenly,...

48:46.500 --> 48:49.970
<i>[continues humming]
[dogs bark]</i>

48:49.980 --> 48:54.000
Row, row, row your boat
Gently down the stream

48:54.050 --> 48:58.400
If you see a crocodile,
Don't forget to scream.

48:58.440 --> 49:00.500
- Aah!...

49:00.660 --> 49:01.900
...Splish splash...

49:02.000 --> 49:08.378
Row, row, row your boat,
Gently down the stream,

49:08.421 --> 49:12.777
If you see a crocodile,
Don't forget to screa...

49:12.778 --> 49:14.000
Aah!!

49:15.819 --> 49:17.700
I can explain everything.

49:17.710 --> 49:20.250
Okay, explain everything.

49:19.800 --> 49:31.858
And also because I live here,

49:22.450 --> 49:25.000
- It's inexplicable. Ali, listen...
- David, no...

49:25.050 --> 49:29.700
David, the reason that I came home
was because I missed you.

49:31.899 --> 49:33.585
and they live here.

49:33.600 --> 49:37.250
But David, we have been
waiting for five hours!

49:37.259 --> 49:38.798
And do we we get?

49:38.800 --> 49:41.950
A drunk... and his friend
from the Planet Zog!

49:41.960 --> 49:47.200
I know it seems like this horrible...
situation... but if you could...

49:47.400 --> 49:51.533
If you could just hear
my full horrific tale.

49:51.578 --> 49:56.207
David, I think I'm gonna
have to leave you.

49:57.458 --> 49:59.050
You are?

50:02.497 --> 50:06.456
Well, then things
really have gotten bad.

50:08.977 --> 50:10.649
Yeah.

50:32.500 --> 50:34.000
Hi, Beanie.

50:37.300 --> 50:40.606
- Can't sleep, huh?
- No.

50:43.100 --> 50:46.891
Me neither. Can't stop
thinking about naked women.

50:48.270 --> 50:52.003
- What about you?
- Whistler's Mother.

50:52.175 --> 50:54.324
Well, whatever turns you on.

51:00.400 --> 51:03.044
Catch you around, Moon-man.

51:04.334 --> 51:07.200
Oh, if you still can't sleep,
come to my room.

51:07.205 --> 51:11.050
I've some great posters of
Cindy Crawford on the wall

53:36.300 --> 53:38.676
Gotcha...

53:38.700 --> 53:40.077
Come on!!

54:07.000 --> 54:09.644
Ugh... God damn it!

56:05.599 --> 56:09.274
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

56:16.450 --> 56:19.116
Jennifer!... No, no, no...

56:19.270 --> 56:21.340
Don’t think for one minute
you’re getting on that bike, Jen.

56:21.345 --> 56:23.828
Morning, everyone.
Aah...

56:24.850 --> 56:26.099
Total family rule here:

56:26.100 --> 56:28.830
No one is allowed on those death traps.
You promised me, Jen.

56:28.878 --> 56:32.238
And you promised mom
you'd get rid of Dr Freako!

56:47.200 --> 56:48.400
- Er...
- Don't talk to me!

56:48.404 --> 56:53.000
I am trying to think what
I'm going to do...

56:55.000 --> 56:57.548
- Well...
- Quiet!

57:11.835 --> 57:13.872
There they are.

57:23.900 --> 57:25.000
This way...

57:29.490 --> 57:30.830
What a pleasure, sir.

57:30.850 --> 57:32.992
Welcome to our humble abode.

57:33.000 --> 57:35.400
Not too humble, I hope.
I'm expecting lunch.

57:35.401 --> 57:40.000
- Of course. General, right this way.
- After you, sir. After you.

57:44.500 --> 57:45.350
Glad you made it!

57:47.500 --> 57:49.670
- Where the hell have you been?
- I am sorry. Trouble at home...

57:49.680 --> 57:51.590
- Oh, never mind. Come along...
- Sir, there was something...

57:51.600 --> 57:54.000
General, I'd like you to meet
our curator, David Langley.

57:54.050 --> 57:56.700
- I'm delighted to meet you sir.
- Of course you are.

57:56.710 --> 57:58.352
Right through here, sir.

58:10.272 --> 58:13.821
Ladies and gentlemen, this is
a great moment for America,

58:13.872 --> 58:17.660
and for one very special lady -
Whistler's Mother.

58:22.000 --> 58:26.000
And she's here today, thanks
to our great and good benefactor.

58:26.071 --> 58:28.790
Will you join me
in saluting a soldier,

58:28.831 --> 58:32.999
philanthropist, loving father...
- Hear, hear!

58:33.000 --> 58:37.500
..and an extremely generous patron
of the arts, General Newton?

58:39.150 --> 58:41.400
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

58:42.031 --> 58:44.989
I am not a traditional art lover.

58:45.031 --> 58:48.520
I don't know the difference between
a Picasso and a car crash.

58:48.630 --> 58:50.400
But I love my country.

58:50.450 --> 58:53.000
I can't stand the idea of
a bunch of Frenchies...

58:53.100 --> 58:55.061
owning America's greatest painting.

58:55.109 --> 58:57.226
Let's get on with it.

59:04.951 --> 59:07.019
Welcome home, Ma.

59:36.200 --> 59:39.600
Whatever you did,
you're a genius, and I love you.

59:39.660 --> 59:42.967
- It's a poster.
- It's a what?

59:43.000 --> 59:45.700
- David, it's time.
- Time for what?

59:45.710 --> 59:47.500
- The speech.
- What? Wait. What speech?

59:47.587 --> 59:50.656
- Congratulations, David.
- Dr Bean's speech about the painting.

59:50.707 --> 59:52.505
Yes, of course, the speech.

59:54.707 --> 59:57.127
Now, Doctor, try to keep it
below an hour.

59:57.147 --> 01:00:00.060
And if there could be one joke in it,
that would be nice.

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:04.259
"Good Morning, America... couldn't
give a flying monkey about '-isms' and..."

01:00:04.337 --> 01:00:06.298
- Oh, you know what I mean.
- Yeah.

01:00:09.300 --> 01:00:12.650
- It doesn’t have to go on for long. Just….
- Dr Bean? We're ready for you.

01:00:12.655 --> 01:00:16.450
- Right this way.
- Just, just, just...

01:00:16.500 --> 01:00:19.544
And now, for the second
highlight of our day,

01:00:19.550 --> 01:00:24.000
Dr Bean, a great English art scholar,
is here to speak for a few minutes,

01:00:24.006 --> 01:00:27.444
not too long, Doctor,
on the subject our new purchase.

01:00:27.456 --> 01:00:32.557
Ladies and gentlemen, Dr Bean
of the National Gallery of England.

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:35.000
Bravo!

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:49.656
Well, hello.

01:00:49.705 --> 01:00:53.458
I'm Dr Bean...apparently...

01:00:55.945 --> 01:01:02.383
and my job is to sit
and look at paintings.

01:01:03.500 --> 01:01:05.000
Just him and the painting?

01:01:10.400 --> 01:01:15.013
So, what have I learned

01:01:15.063 --> 01:01:19.135
that I can say
about this painting?

01:01:23.342 --> 01:01:28.000
Well, firstly, it's quite big.

01:01:28.350 --> 01:01:30.350
Which is excellent.

01:01:30.750 --> 01:01:36.541
Because if it was really small -
you know, microscopic -

01:01:36.583 --> 01:01:39.900
then hardly anybody
would be able to see it,

01:01:39.955 --> 01:01:43.530
which would be
a tremendous shame.

01:01:43.981 --> 01:01:45.555
Secondly...

01:01:46.721 --> 01:01:48.959
and I'm getting quite
near the end now

01:01:48.962 --> 01:01:54.259
of this analysis
of this painting...

01:01:55.961 --> 01:01:58.555
Secondly...

01:02:01.740 --> 01:02:04.335
Why was it worth this man here

01:02:05.421 --> 01:02:09.890
spending fifty million
of your American dollars

01:02:09.940 --> 01:02:11.692
on this portrait?

01:02:12.419 --> 01:02:15.555
And the answer is...

01:02:16.400 --> 01:02:21.577
Well, this picture is worth
such a lot of money

01:02:21.599 --> 01:02:23.133
because...

01:02:26.580 --> 01:02:28.968
it's a picture...

01:02:29.444 --> 01:02:32.600
of Whistler's Mother.

01:02:33.620 --> 01:02:40.250
And, as I've learnt
by staying with my best friend,

01:02:40.300 --> 01:02:43.500
David Langley, and his family,

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:47.900
families are very important.

01:02:48.222 --> 01:02:51.345
And even though Mr Whistler

01:02:51.350 --> 01:02:53.847
was perfectly aware

01:02:53.897 --> 01:02:57.552
that his mother
was a hideous old bat

01:02:57.600 --> 01:03:01.600
who looked like she had a cactus
lodged up her backside,

01:03:02.600 --> 01:03:05.087
he stuck with her,

01:03:05.137 --> 01:03:10.530
and even took the time to paint
this amazing picture of her.

01:03:11.617 --> 01:03:14.005
It's not just a painting.

01:03:14.500 --> 01:03:19.000
It's a picture of a mad old cow

01:03:19.117 --> 01:03:21.700
who he thought the world of.

01:03:22.497 --> 01:03:24.647
And that's marvellous.

01:03:26.500 --> 01:03:28.500
Well, that's what I think anyway.

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:30.000
Bravo.

01:03:47.295 --> 01:03:49.490
Okay, let's seal it up.

01:04:01.800 --> 01:04:02.888
Home and dry.

01:04:02.900 --> 01:04:05.764
Where did you put the original?

01:04:07.474 --> 01:04:10.969
Mr Langley, may I have a word?

01:04:11.600 --> 01:04:13.400
Stay here. Shut up.

01:04:13.414 --> 01:04:16.449
- Mr Langley...
- Okay, I can explain everything.

01:04:16.495 --> 01:04:18.199
- What can you explain?
- About the painting.

01:04:18.200 --> 01:04:21.333
- Which painting?
- "Whistler's Mother".

01:04:21.374 --> 01:04:23.947
I'm afraid, Mr Langley, I'm here
in my capacity as a police officer,

01:04:23.950 --> 01:04:25.400
Not as an art lover.

01:04:25.410 --> 01:04:29.686
It's about your daughter. She's been
in a motorcycle accident.

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:56.885
Damn!

01:04:56.900 --> 01:04:59.000
Request emergency clearance
for 8-0-9-Adam.

01:04:59.200 --> 01:05:00.200
Shut up!

01:05:02.500 --> 01:05:06.607
2-11 in progress. Suspect male, possibly armed.
Request immediate back-up. Copy.

01:05:06.617 --> 01:05:09.000
- Keep speeding. If you get a ticket,
I'll tear it up.   - Thanks!

01:05:09.171 --> 01:05:13.888
Hold it! Okay, easy, fella, easy, easy...
Hold it there. Right there. Halt!

01:05:13.900 --> 01:05:16.608
Easy. Put it down.
Put the gun down.

01:05:17.100 --> 01:05:18.000
<i> [Gun fire]</i>

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:24.085
Hi, I need Jennifer Langley's room.
She came in about 11 o'clock.

01:05:24.100 --> 01:05:25.900
Motorcycle accident.

01:05:25.950 --> 01:05:28.500
- Got it.
- Out of the way, sir.

01:05:40.280 --> 01:05:44.199
She's on the fifth floor, east wing.
Just take the elevator up.

01:05:44.444 --> 01:05:46.806
- Aah!... Just...

01:05:47.444 --> 01:05:50.000
All right.
Aah!

01:05:50.300 --> 01:05:53.300
- Get off of that.
- Wait. I'm so... Just...

01:05:53.900 --> 01:05:57.925
Please, just stay here
and do nothing!

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:01.007
If you do nothing,
nothing can go wrong.

01:06:02.700 --> 01:06:05.444
I've got to take care
of my family now.

01:06:24.767 --> 01:06:28.157
The nurse says
that it's not a coma,

01:06:28.207 --> 01:06:32.100
that she's just... she's just
sort of taking time out.

01:06:32.888 --> 01:06:36.241
But we haven't seen
a doctor yet, so I don't...

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:44.999
Dr Jacobson, we need you
urgently in OR-3.

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:47.374
- No can do. I’m due in number 4 at 1:00.
- Sir, it's urgent.

01:06:47.375 --> 01:06:49.999
We have a ruptured kidney
and massive bleeding.

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:51.333
Okay.

01:07:03.700 --> 01:07:05.515
Yes, it's urgent.

01:07:06.150 --> 01:07:08.238
- What's happening?
- Surgeon's on his way.

01:07:10.280 --> 01:07:12.859
At last, Dr... Bean.

01:07:12.900 --> 01:07:13.899
Hello doctor,

01:07:13.900 --> 01:07:16.234
We've got a 45-year-old male,
blood type B negative

01:07:16.235 --> 01:07:17.800
Brought in by paramedics
ten minutes ago.

01:07:17.801 --> 01:07:20.900
- He's got a penetrating injury
to the left chest.   - Steth...

01:07:20.901 --> 01:07:23.300
- All right, all right. You've got that sir?
- [mumbling] The stethoscope’s fallen...

01:07:23.301 --> 01:07:25.316
Gotta get him in there right now.

01:07:26.500 --> 01:07:27.596
Good afternoon, doctor.

01:07:27.600 --> 01:07:30.275
It looks like a bullet in the lower thorax.
It seems to have ruptured the lung

01:07:30.276 --> 01:07:32.000
And there's severe inner bleeding
along the abdomen.

01:07:32.001 --> 01:07:33.500
Docter, he's coming to.

01:07:33.501 --> 01:07:35.401
- All right, give him a T-70.
- Got it.

01:07:45.500 --> 01:07:46.940
Shall I extend the incision, sir?

01:07:46.941 --> 01:07:49.100
We've taken it from the breastbone
to the diaphragm.

01:07:49.101 --> 01:07:52.249
We may have to extend further
to get to the spleen.

01:07:52.250 --> 01:07:53.500
Get that....

01:07:53.505 --> 01:07:55.990
Sorry, sir,
it's only my first week.

01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:59.300
No, you're right doctor.
We should wait for X-rays.

01:07:59.303 --> 01:08:01.429
Help. We are losing
this guy out here.

01:08:01.430 --> 01:08:03.430
- For Jesus' sake, we need help.
- Go, go, go...

01:08:06.650 --> 01:08:10.450
Watch he doesn't go into haemodynamic shock.
We'll be right back.

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:20.358
- He's fibrillating!
- Charge the paddles at 200W.

01:08:23.800 --> 01:08:25.479
Clear!

01:09:05.200 --> 01:09:07.000
What's that?

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:10.550
Oh!

01:09:10.555 --> 01:09:12.255
What...?

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:41.500
Jolly good. Clean it up.

01:10:00.800 --> 01:10:02.111
Sorry to keep you waiting, sir.

01:10:02.121 --> 01:10:04.010
Nice work in there, people,
now back to the bleeding.

01:10:04.020 --> 01:10:05.500
Where's this blood coming from.
We gotta clamp it off.

01:10:05.501 --> 01:10:06.900
Where's that J-17?

01:10:06.901 --> 01:10:09.300
- We need a J-17 in OR-4 right now.
- He's got major trauma.

01:10:09.303 --> 01:10:11.273
There's too much blood.
I can't see a thing.

01:10:11.275 --> 01:10:12.850
- More suction!
- Pack the bleeding.

01:10:12.855 --> 01:10:16.200
- Somebody check that line.
- Pressure's bottoming out.

01:10:16.220 --> 01:10:20.000
His heart rate is dropping!
We're gonna lose him!

01:10:20.002 --> 01:10:22.222
C'mon people, he's crashing on us!

01:10:22.233 --> 01:10:23.999
- I'm not getting a reading.
- Where is this bullet?!

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:25.572
- Hang in there fellow.
- Come on, hold on to him.

01:10:25.573 --> 01:10:27.070
If we don't find it, he's a dead man.

01:10:27.074 --> 01:10:29.748
I am not going to lose him!

01:10:30.500 --> 01:10:33.673
Sorry sir, we're losing him.
I've got to get in there now!

01:10:37.754 --> 01:10:41.144
Doctor, you can't just...
This is too dangerous!

01:10:53.500 --> 01:10:55.500
My God!

01:10:58.273 --> 01:10:59.427
Incredible.

01:10:59.428 --> 01:11:02.427
Heart rate is stabilising.
Blood pressure's climbing back.

01:11:16.818 --> 01:11:19.227
Oh, doctor, thank God.
My daughter was in an accident.

01:11:19.228 --> 01:11:20.625
No one's even taken
a look at her yet.

01:11:20.626 --> 01:11:24.000
We're desperate for some
medical attention in here.

01:11:24.500 --> 01:11:26.900
Would you mind?

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:31.850
Don't worry, honey.
The doctor will check her out.

01:11:31.851 --> 01:11:33.300
Oh. Thank God.

01:11:37.200 --> 01:11:38.900
Uh, Mr and Mrs Langley,

01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:40.220
Any kind of damage to the brain

01:11:40.271 --> 01:11:42.280
is a very sensitive thing
to observe,

01:11:42.300 --> 01:11:45.800
so maybe we should step outside
and give the doctor a little room to work.

01:11:45.810 --> 01:11:48.100
The first nurse said we shouldn't
think of it as a coma

01:11:48.101 --> 01:11:50.747
but more like a deep sleep.
- Yes. That's sort of true...

01:11:50.750 --> 01:11:52.300
Can I ask you a question?...

01:12:02.700 --> 01:12:04.222
Jennifer?

01:12:04.700 --> 01:12:08.600
Wakey, wakey.
Breakfast's ready.

01:12:08.700 --> 01:12:10.586
Jennifer?

01:12:10.990 --> 01:12:13.025
What time is it?

01:12:14.250 --> 01:12:16.000
It's almost 2.

01:12:16.350 --> 01:12:19.828
Can you turn the clock back
about 12 hours for me?

01:12:20.700 --> 01:12:22.142
Sure.

01:12:32.700 --> 01:12:34.939
Wake up, wake up!

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:37.000
Wake up!

01:12:37.700 --> 01:12:40.696
I don't know
what to say about Bean.

01:12:40.700 --> 01:12:45.000
He's clearly a Force 10
disaster area, but...

01:12:45.700 --> 01:12:47.700
- God, help me! -

01:12:48.100 --> 01:12:50.000
I like him.

01:12:52.700 --> 01:12:56.890
Now, having said that,
there is no reason in the world

01:12:56.900 --> 01:13:00.739
why any of you should ever have
anything to do with him again.

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:43.698
Mom! Dad! Anyone?

01:13:43.784 --> 01:13:45.315
Oh my God! Jennifer!

01:13:45.325 --> 01:13:48.400
- Oh honey! Look at you!...
- Mom, what happened?

01:13:48.440 --> 01:13:52.000
You had an accident, honey,
but everything is gonna be okay.

01:13:52.500 --> 01:13:55.600
- What happened to Stingo?
- Just bruises, collar bone...

01:13:55.611 --> 01:13:58.611
He'll be fine...
until I get my hands on him.

01:13:58.700 --> 01:14:02.000
Hey, hey, doctor,
where are you going?

01:14:02.100 --> 01:14:05.500
How can we ever say thank you?
You've made us so happy.

01:14:05.600 --> 01:14:06.540
Tell us, what can we do?

01:14:06.542 --> 01:14:08.600
- We'll do anything.
- Anything.

01:14:16.350 --> 01:14:20.200
Well, I suppose you could
let me stay another week.

01:14:31.860 --> 01:14:33.932
Sunset Boulevard!

01:14:55.555 --> 01:14:56.789
<i> Discover me</i>

01:15:35.820 --> 01:15:38.000
Hey, what's this all about?

01:15:38.500 --> 01:15:39.500
Presents!

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:41.096
This is heavy.

01:15:41.100 --> 01:15:42.450
Thank you.

01:15:42.459 --> 01:15:44.459
- Thanks.
- Thanks.

01:15:46.700 --> 01:15:50.772
Look, laxatives. Yeah,
a whole box of them!

01:15:50.818 --> 01:15:54.890
- Oh, hey, there they are!
- Six of them.

01:15:55.800 --> 01:15:57.700
Barbie!

01:15:59.555 --> 01:16:01.555
- Thanks!
- What'd you get there?

01:16:13.845 --> 01:16:15.345
Smile!

01:16:24.700 --> 01:16:27.012
Give us a smile.

01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:32.700
- Bye-bye!
- Bye!

01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:35.000
Bye, Beanie!

01:16:38.800 --> 01:16:40.000
See ya!

01:16:42.200 --> 01:16:44.015
Farewell!

01:16:49.500 --> 01:16:53.300
<i> [airport speakers] Do not leave your car unattended.

01:16:53.301 --> 01:16:57.000
Well, Beanie, it's been...

01:16:58.000 --> 01:16:59.600
...surreal.

01:17:00.414 --> 01:17:04.414
I want you to know, you can come back
and visit any time...

01:17:05.014 --> 01:17:07.528
..in the fairly distant future.

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:14.000
I know it sounds insane, but...

01:17:14.500 --> 01:17:16.000
I'm really gonna miss you.

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:20.700
Okay...

01:17:38.900 --> 01:17:40.000
Okay.

01:17:40.200 --> 01:17:42.000
Bye again.

Bye.
