01:00.161 --> 01:01.595
Hello, everybody.

01:02.730 --> 01:04.365
Hello. Thank you.

01:08.436 --> 01:10.138
Hello.

01:10.171 --> 01:12.206
Thank you.

01:12.273 --> 01:14.575
Thank you so much.

01:14.642 --> 01:17.211
Hello, everybody.
Welcome to the Grand Tour,

01:17.278 --> 01:20.148
which, this week,
comes from the Netherlands.

01:23.851 --> 01:25.886
We're setting something
of a record, actually,

01:25.953 --> 01:31.159
cos we are the first three
British men ever to come here
for a weekend

01:31.159 --> 01:33.161
and not vomit
on a prostitute.

01:34.495 --> 01:36.230
Actually,
we love coming to Holland.

01:36.297 --> 01:37.965
James for his...
for his own reasons.

01:40.268 --> 01:43.003
And I like it because
the Dutch are officially

01:43.070 --> 01:45.173
the tallest people on earth.

01:45.173 --> 01:46.907
It's true. True fact.

01:46.974 --> 01:49.510
-Yes, and I hate it here.
I'm sick of...

01:49.577 --> 01:52.513
I'm sick of staring
at belly buttons all day.

01:52.580 --> 01:57.951
The only problem I do have here
is that I'm not allowed to use
the word "swaffelen".

01:58.018 --> 01:59.353
RICHARD: Yeah.

01:59.420 --> 02:00.921
Well, you just did,
didn't you?

02:00.988 --> 02:05.193
No, the thing is, OK,
it is a really bad word here,

02:05.259 --> 02:06.860
and I have no idea why.

02:10.864 --> 02:14.702
It means to bang
your gentleman sausage...

02:14.768 --> 02:16.937
...on the side
of the Taj Mahal.

02:17.004 --> 02:18.939
-Oh, God!

02:19.006 --> 02:20.741
Anyway, listen. Erm...

02:20.808 --> 02:24.478
We're in Rotterdam,
which is a marvellous city,
in fact,

02:24.545 --> 02:26.614
because you aren't allowed to
bring a car into the city -

02:26.680 --> 02:31.252
a petrol car -
if it was built before 1992.

02:31.319 --> 02:35.623
You aren't allowed to bring
a diesel car into the city
if it was built before 2000,

02:35.689 --> 02:39.059
which means you're never
held up by poor people.

02:42.062 --> 02:44.932
-What else can we say
about the Dutch?

02:44.998 --> 02:47.735
-Oh, of course, you gave
the world speed cameras.
-Oh, yeah.

02:47.801 --> 02:50.738
-So thank you very much
for that.
-Thank you.

02:50.804 --> 02:52.973
No, actually,
I'd far rather be pulled over

02:53.040 --> 02:56.544
by the actual Dutch police
rather than a speed camera,

02:56.610 --> 02:59.247
cos, boy, oh, boy,
do these guys look good.

02:59.313 --> 03:00.314
-We've got a picture here.
-Whoa!

03:02.283 --> 03:06.854
I would very much like to see
a lady policeman in an outfit
like that.

03:06.920 --> 03:10.023
-It looks like the guy
on the right already has.

03:10.090 --> 03:12.926
-Shall we get on
with the show... man?

03:12.993 --> 03:14.595
Yes, good idea. Er...

03:14.662 --> 03:17.865
And coming up in our
programme about cars
this week...

03:19.166 --> 03:21.034
I try to pull a camel.

03:21.101 --> 03:23.404
Come on. Come on.

03:23.471 --> 03:25.639
A donkey pulls James.

03:26.907 --> 03:29.443
And Richard gets stuck
in a cow orgy.

03:29.510 --> 03:32.746
I-I really am alarmed.

03:32.813 --> 03:38.352
But first, there's been a bit
of an argument in the office
between these two.

03:38.419 --> 03:40.187
You see, Richard maintains

03:40.288 --> 03:44.858
that the Mazda MX-5
is all the sports car
you would ever need.

03:44.925 --> 03:48.195
-Because it is.
-Mm-hm.
But James says it isn't.

03:48.296 --> 03:49.797
Because it isn't.

03:51.131 --> 03:53.801
So we decided
they should sort it out

03:53.867 --> 03:58.406
by going to
the obvious proving ground
for all sports cars:

03:58.472 --> 04:00.408
North Africa.

04:35.976 --> 04:37.678
RICHARD: This is it,

04:37.745 --> 04:42.350
the latest version of
the bestselling two-seater
roadster of all time.

04:43.517 --> 04:45.453
And it's easy to see why.

04:45.519 --> 04:47.054
Peppy little engine
at the front,

04:47.120 --> 04:50.424
two seats in the open air in
the middle, rearwheel drive.

04:50.491 --> 04:53.093
It's the perfect
sports-car recipe.

04:53.160 --> 04:55.963
But layered on top of that
in this new version

04:56.029 --> 04:58.432
you get air conditioning,
heated seats,

04:58.499 --> 05:00.834
lane-departure assist,
cruise control,

05:00.901 --> 05:03.637
rain-sensing wipers,
dusk-sensing headlamps.

05:03.704 --> 05:05.839
You just can't do any better.

05:05.906 --> 05:09.743
Well, you can, actually,
because all of those luxury
items you're mentioning now,

05:09.810 --> 05:13.481
they just add weight,
and they mean it isn't
a true sports car any more.

05:13.547 --> 05:14.982
-Yes, it is.
-No, it isn't.

05:15.048 --> 05:17.751
Colin Chapman, he was
the bloke who founded Lotus,

05:17.818 --> 05:21.789
he said the ethos of
a sports car is simplify
and add lightness.

05:21.855 --> 05:24.625
He didn't say you simplify
and add electric windows.

05:24.692 --> 05:29.196
Yep, and then he gave all his
money away to a drug dealer
called John DeLorean.

05:29.262 --> 05:31.131
This, ladies and gentlemen,
is what it's actually about.

05:31.198 --> 05:33.200
This is called the Zenos.

05:33.266 --> 05:36.904
You get four wheels,
you get somewhere to sit,
an engine, and that's it.

05:36.970 --> 05:38.506
It's a sports car.

05:38.572 --> 05:41.642
-Yeah.
What do you do if it rains?
-Well, you'd get wet.

05:41.709 --> 05:43.644
What if you want to listen
to the radio?

05:43.711 --> 05:45.579
Why would I want to listen
to the radio around here?

05:45.646 --> 05:47.280
-No.

05:47.415 --> 05:50.183
-Look, if you buy
a football boot,

05:50.250 --> 05:53.286
you don't expect it to be
usable as a ballet shoe,
do you?

05:53.421 --> 05:58.191
But Mazda has invented
a football boot that you can
wear to the opera.

05:58.258 --> 06:02.029
Look, I can guarantee
that if you wear that shoe
to the opera house...

06:02.095 --> 06:03.864
RICHARD: At this point,
the director said

06:03.931 --> 06:06.900
he'd heard enough about shoes
for one day...

06:10.137 --> 06:12.640
...and told us
to go for a drive.

06:20.247 --> 06:23.183
Right, now I'm away from
Hammond's luxury sports car
resort,

06:23.250 --> 06:26.454
let me tell you a little bit
about this remarkable car.

06:27.721 --> 06:30.123
It's powered by
the 2L turbocharged engine

06:30.190 --> 06:33.727
from the Ford Focus ST,
giving 250 horsepower.

06:33.794 --> 06:36.464
That's mounted in the middle,
right behind my head there,

06:36.497 --> 06:38.832
driving the rear wheels
through a no-nonsense,

06:38.899 --> 06:42.169
old-school six-speed gearbox.

06:42.235 --> 06:45.773
Now, 250 horsepower
doesn't sound like a huge
amount in the modern world,

06:45.839 --> 06:48.842
but this car,
made with an aluminium spine

06:48.909 --> 06:51.712
and composite tub,
and all the rest of it,

06:51.779 --> 06:53.747
weighs less than
three quarters of a tonne,

06:53.814 --> 06:56.049
so it is genuinely quick.

06:56.116 --> 06:57.785
Look... Whoa!

07:04.692 --> 07:06.794
Yeah!

07:09.830 --> 07:15.736
It makes the noise of some
futuristic propulsion system
powered by antimatter.

07:21.174 --> 07:23.143
Yes! Electrifying!

07:31.151 --> 07:35.155
James comes from a world
where he wants his phone
and his camera separate.

07:35.222 --> 07:36.724
"I like a paper diary."

07:36.790 --> 07:39.860
This Mazda is a smartphone.
It does everything.

07:43.330 --> 07:47.067
It looks brilliant,
it will be endlessly reliable,
it's fast,

07:47.134 --> 07:50.037
it's got speakers
in the headrests,
and it handles well.

07:54.207 --> 07:57.578
And you can get an MX-5
from Â£18,500.

07:57.645 --> 08:00.548
James's car
starts at Â£33,000,

08:00.548 --> 08:02.783
and you don't even get doors!

08:02.850 --> 08:05.218
My shed has got doors.

08:05.285 --> 08:08.055
I furnish my cats with doors.

08:08.121 --> 08:09.657
You need doors.

08:17.030 --> 08:20.400
I bet he's being shaken
to death in that thing.

08:20.467 --> 08:22.202
I bet Hammond thinks
I'm being shaken to death
in here,

08:22.269 --> 08:23.604
but actually he's wrong,

08:23.671 --> 08:27.040
because this isn't like
a BAC Mono or a Radical.

08:27.107 --> 08:30.443
It is obviously very much a
car for taking on the track,

08:30.578 --> 08:32.379
but it's been tuned
for road use.

08:32.445 --> 08:33.647
It's quite supple.

08:33.714 --> 08:34.815
See? Look.

08:34.882 --> 08:37.417
Bump. It's all right.

08:37.484 --> 08:38.886
I'm very relaxed.

08:44.457 --> 08:47.027
JAMES: Eventually,
we pulled over
for a cup of coffee

08:47.094 --> 08:49.262
and a bit more arguing
about doors.

08:50.898 --> 08:53.066
Just because they had them
in the 12th century

08:53.133 --> 08:55.402
on cathedrals, whatever,
you don't need them now.

08:55.468 --> 08:56.870
Don't be a slave
to convention.

08:56.937 --> 08:59.006
But people had eyelids
in the 12th century,

08:59.072 --> 09:01.709
and nobody's deciding,
"Let's get rid of those,
they're old hat."

09:01.775 --> 09:04.211
"Oh, no! I've got dust in
my eyes and I can't sleep."

09:04.277 --> 09:06.413
That's completely facile,
Hammond. You know exactly
what I mean.

09:06.479 --> 09:09.082
The door... I mean,
Riva speedboats
don't have doors.

09:09.149 --> 09:10.618
You don't say...

09:10.651 --> 09:13.486
This is lovely, isn't it?

09:13.621 --> 09:15.088
What are you doing here?

09:15.155 --> 09:17.725
Well, word reached me that
you two were talking rubbish.

09:17.791 --> 09:21.228
-Well, if you want
the best sports car,

09:21.294 --> 09:23.831
you don't want a Mazda
or a Zenos. You want--

09:23.897 --> 09:25.733
Oh, God.
He's brought an Alfa Romeo.

09:25.799 --> 09:27.300
Yes, of course I have.

09:27.367 --> 09:30.303
Alfa Romeo 4C Spider.

09:36.376 --> 09:39.647
JEREMY: This is what
I'm talking about.

09:39.647 --> 09:42.482
A symphony in carbon fibre.

09:42.549 --> 09:44.517
Balance personified.

09:44.652 --> 09:46.954
The Graduate updated.

09:47.020 --> 09:49.923
A mini Ferrari,
as cute as a bunny rabbit,

09:49.990 --> 09:53.393
with the greatest badge
in the history of mo--

09:53.460 --> 09:55.128
How much is it?

09:55.195 --> 09:58.666
-You know perfectly well
how much it is.
-Yeah, we've forgotten.

09:59.299 --> 10:00.834
Money is vulgar.

10:00.901 --> 10:05.072
You can't put a price
on something
as exquisite as that.

10:05.138 --> 10:07.340
Yeah, but Alfa Romeo
did put a price on it,
didn't they?

10:07.407 --> 10:08.475
And what was it?

10:08.541 --> 10:10.678
-Sixty thousand pounds.

10:10.744 --> 10:14.147
So you could have both
of our cars and everything
in the back of shot

10:14.214 --> 10:16.283
for the price of
one of these Alfa Romeos?

10:16.349 --> 10:19.720
I know, it is extraordinary
value for money.

10:19.787 --> 10:23.290
-It's too far
from outside to inside.
-It's miles!

10:23.356 --> 10:24.758
JEREMY: Yes, thick sills...

10:24.825 --> 10:26.694
-Here we go.
-...for strength.

10:26.760 --> 10:28.962
Look at this,
rotary heater knobs.

10:29.029 --> 10:31.498
-It's like being in
the 1970s.
-Yeah, it is, actually.

10:31.564 --> 10:32.800
This handbrake, look at that.

10:32.866 --> 10:35.035
Is that fixed on
or does that come off?

10:35.102 --> 10:37.537
Alfa Romeo, purveyors
of disappointment
for nearly three decades.

10:37.604 --> 10:39.606
RICHARD:
Look at this. Classy.

10:39.673 --> 10:42.242
RICHARD: Yeah.
Feel the quality in that.
JAMES: Let me feel that.

10:42.309 --> 10:45.112
RICHARD: Mm.
JAMES: Sixty thousand
pounds?!

10:45.178 --> 10:46.413
RICHARD: Mm. And this...

10:46.479 --> 10:48.081
That's what you want to hear.

10:48.148 --> 10:50.984
If you ever buy
a new item of clothing,
never show it these two.

10:51.051 --> 10:55.155
"What are you wearing that
jacket for? It makes you look
like a German gameshow host."

10:55.222 --> 10:56.890
RICHARD: That's satisfying.

10:56.957 --> 10:58.759
JAMES: Why are you wearing
that jacket?

10:58.826 --> 11:00.994
Because I was at a party
in India last night,

11:01.061 --> 11:02.462
and I've hurried over here.

11:02.529 --> 11:03.997
RICHARD: Why did you go
to the party

11:04.064 --> 11:05.332
dressed as a German
gameshow host?

11:07.267 --> 11:09.737
JEREMY: Soon,
I grew weary of their abuse

11:09.803 --> 11:12.339
and set off in what,
be in no doubt,

11:12.405 --> 11:16.543
is my favourite car
on sale today.

11:16.609 --> 11:22.615
I will admit, there are
one or two tiny little
problems with the 4C.

11:22.750 --> 11:24.217
Trivial stuff.

11:24.284 --> 11:28.155
It's very wide. The gearbox
is a little bit dim-witted.

11:28.221 --> 11:32.592
If you fit sports exhausts,
the noise is catastrophic.

11:32.659 --> 11:35.028
The petrol tank...
yeah, that's too small.

11:35.095 --> 11:39.767
You've really only got
a range of 300... yards.

11:39.800 --> 11:41.969
And then there's
the steering.

11:42.035 --> 11:45.672
There's no power assistance,
so it's incredibly heavy
when you're parking,

11:45.773 --> 11:48.776
there's no feel
when you're on the move.

11:48.842 --> 11:50.543
And then,
and this is its party piece,

11:50.610 --> 11:56.149
just occasionally,
it'll go violently left
or right for no reason.

11:57.017 --> 11:59.286
Whoa! You see that?

11:59.352 --> 12:00.420
Bloody hell.

12:04.024 --> 12:08.796
But look at it this way,
we could all probably find
fault with our children,

12:08.829 --> 12:11.464
and yet...
we still love them.

12:16.269 --> 12:17.871
RICHARD:
Jeremy loves Alfa Romeos

12:17.938 --> 12:19.339
because,
back in the old days,

12:19.406 --> 12:22.109
they were great...
but they're not any more.

12:23.543 --> 12:26.013
Plenty of things were great.

12:26.079 --> 12:27.547
Greece.

12:27.614 --> 12:29.016
Rolf Harris.

12:29.983 --> 12:31.484
You can't love them now.

12:36.156 --> 12:38.058
Another small problem
with the Alfa

12:38.125 --> 12:39.426
that I didn't mention earlier

12:39.492 --> 12:41.628
is that you get cramp
after five minutes.

12:43.296 --> 12:45.833
Ooh! Arg!

12:45.833 --> 12:47.835
I'm gonna have to stop
and go for a walk,

12:47.901 --> 12:49.436
and they'll want to know why,

12:49.502 --> 12:52.505
and I'll have to tell them
I need a wee or something.

12:52.572 --> 12:53.974
No, diarrhoea.

12:54.041 --> 12:56.409
Sorry, I've got to stop.
I've got to stop.

12:56.476 --> 12:59.712
RADIO: I'm just stopping
for a minute here. Hang on.

12:59.847 --> 13:01.248
Why are you stopping
for a minute?

13:02.415 --> 13:04.217
JEREMY: Ohhh! Nothing.

13:04.284 --> 13:05.853
Well,
why are you hopping about?

13:05.886 --> 13:08.688
Look at the snowy mountains.

13:08.755 --> 13:10.457
You are welcome to Morocco.

13:10.523 --> 13:13.660
Ah, merci, monsieur.
Comment Ã§a va?

13:13.726 --> 13:15.195
JAMES: God above.

13:17.064 --> 13:18.665
-No.

13:18.731 --> 13:20.233
Yes, you have.

13:20.300 --> 13:23.170
Right, good.
Well, I've seen the view.

13:23.236 --> 13:26.239
I just wanted to see
the view, and it's lovely.

13:31.744 --> 13:34.882
JEREMY: Back on the road,
James suddenly delivered

13:34.882 --> 13:38.151
a very un-James-manlike
observation.

13:38.218 --> 13:41.554
My car is seriously quick!

13:41.621 --> 13:43.156
It's not as fast as this.

13:43.991 --> 13:45.325
Yeah, I bet it is.

13:45.392 --> 13:51.531
James, this has a
turbocharged 1750cc engine

13:51.598 --> 13:53.033
from a Fiat Punto.

13:53.100 --> 13:57.004
Mine's 2L with
a twin-scroll turbocharger.

13:57.070 --> 14:02.142
Have you noticed Hammond
is being strangely quiet
on the subject of speed?

14:02.209 --> 14:05.012
Oh, just listening
to you two bicker.

14:05.078 --> 14:08.115
I am a bit down on power,
if I'm honest.

14:08.181 --> 14:14.154
I think Hammond's in a sort of
retirement home for former
distressed sports-car owners.

14:17.690 --> 14:20.693
JEREMY:
Right, next straight bit
of road, James May,

14:20.760 --> 14:25.032
I will pull over
and show you
what real speed is.

14:26.566 --> 14:28.401
-Cows.

14:28.468 --> 14:31.004
RICHARD:
On a roof rack.
I've never seen that.

14:33.473 --> 14:37.277
JEREMY: Soon, we found
a suitable stretch of road...

14:37.344 --> 14:40.080
...and Hammond agreed
to be the starter.

14:42.482 --> 14:45.618
-I've got launch control.
-Not interested.

14:48.021 --> 14:50.757
JEREMY: Are you ready?
Before anyone comes.

14:50.823 --> 14:53.994
RICHARD:
In three, two, one, go!

14:59.766 --> 15:01.601
Well, now,
that's just impossible!

15:06.206 --> 15:08.208
It's the Zenos...

15:08.275 --> 15:10.677
which means James May
has just won a drag race.

15:12.512 --> 15:17.017
JEREMY: But for me, that
wasn't the biggest surprise.

15:17.084 --> 15:20.320
I don't understand
why this lost,

15:20.387 --> 15:22.990
because instead of
a conventional chassis,

15:23.023 --> 15:25.125
it has a carbon-fibre tub,

15:25.192 --> 15:27.894
like you get
in a Formula One car

15:27.995 --> 15:29.997
or a McLaren P1.

15:29.997 --> 15:36.669
And a carbon-fibre tub
makes a car...
expensive, but light.

15:36.736 --> 15:38.838
Very light.

15:38.905 --> 15:41.608
I'm trying to work out
why I lost that race.

15:41.674 --> 15:44.877
I think it's cos your car
isn't as fast as mine.

15:45.012 --> 15:46.179
RICHARD: That was a factor.

15:46.246 --> 15:49.049
Yeah, but mine is so light.

15:49.116 --> 15:50.383
RICHARD:
How do you know it's light?

15:50.450 --> 15:51.418
Every time Alfa say
how much it weighs,

15:51.484 --> 15:53.253
they give a different figure.

15:53.320 --> 15:55.055
JEREMY: Yeah,
that's because they've got

15:55.122 --> 15:58.658
better things to do
than go around
weighing cars.

15:58.725 --> 16:00.793
When Picasso had finished
one of his paintings,

16:00.860 --> 16:03.830
he didn't say, "Oh, I wonder
how much that weighs."

16:03.896 --> 16:07.134
You need to know
the weight of an Alfa
for when you resell it,

16:07.200 --> 16:09.736
because you buy scrap cars
by weight.

16:11.438 --> 16:13.806
JEREMY: With the Zenos,
that was built in Norfolk,

16:13.873 --> 16:15.908
so obviously
they're gonna weigh it -
there's nothing else to do.

16:16.043 --> 16:18.045
This is from Milan.

16:18.078 --> 16:22.149
They finished making it,
and then they went into town
with one and pulled girls.

16:24.351 --> 16:25.818
JAMES:
It's massive and
it's made of pig iron,

16:25.885 --> 16:27.120
that's the problem.

16:27.187 --> 16:29.122
I can see
the carbon fibre...

16:29.189 --> 16:33.260
JEREMY:
The weight argument raged on
for the rest of the journey.

16:34.927 --> 16:37.564
So, that night,
at the hotel,

16:37.630 --> 16:39.466
I came up with a plan.

16:39.532 --> 16:42.069
I'm gonna weigh
all three cars

16:42.069 --> 16:45.872
to prove the Alfa's
the lightest.

16:45.938 --> 16:49.176
The problem with your plan
is that you'd need
a weighbridge, and...

16:49.242 --> 16:50.543
-Yes.
-Well, hang on.

16:50.610 --> 16:52.379
-Well, get one.
-No, there isn't one.

16:52.445 --> 16:54.714
I have got the hotel brochure
here, actually,

16:54.781 --> 16:57.617
and, do you know,
it's got three restaurants,

16:57.684 --> 17:02.455
a spa, and a gym,
a business centre,
tennis court.

17:02.522 --> 17:03.923
JEREMY: Mm-hm.
-But with one
glaring omission.

17:03.990 --> 17:05.792
-There's no weighbridge.

17:05.858 --> 17:09.196
-No!
-They haven't thought of that.
I'd knock a star off.

17:10.130 --> 17:12.265
I shall build one.

17:12.332 --> 17:15.102
I shall build a weighbridge,
and then you shall see.

17:19.539 --> 17:21.708
-I will build a weighbridge.
-That could have been

17:21.774 --> 17:26.913
a really useful
and interesting test,
and you've ruined it.

17:26.979 --> 17:28.981
People are interested in
Alfa Romeos!

17:29.116 --> 17:31.718
People are
interested in murders,
they don't want to see one.

17:31.784 --> 17:34.821
Anyway, anyway, we'll have
more of that later on,

17:34.887 --> 17:37.957
but first, it is now time
for us to engage reverse

17:38.024 --> 17:42.229
and park neatly in a marked
space on Conversation Street.

17:50.137 --> 17:55.608
Right, now,
which nation on earth
has the worst police cars?

17:55.675 --> 17:58.745
Oh, that's some good
conversation.
I like that one.

17:58.811 --> 18:01.748
The worst police cars,
it's definitely not the
Americans, is it,

18:01.814 --> 18:04.284
because they have those
Crown Vics, and they're
rearwheel drive V8s.

18:04.351 --> 18:08.521
-That's what you need.
-They're good police cars.
Not the Americans.

18:08.588 --> 18:11.991
-Erm...
-It's us. It's the British.

18:12.058 --> 18:15.628
Yeah.
We have those dreary little
Vauxhall diesel Astras.

18:15.695 --> 18:17.063
Opels if you live here.

18:17.164 --> 18:19.732
Or, if you're in America,
those miserable little
Chevrolets

18:19.799 --> 18:21.534
that are actually Daewoos.
It's awful.

18:21.601 --> 18:23.270
Most countries
around the world

18:23.336 --> 18:25.672
would traditionally have
always had a police car
that was made there,

18:25.738 --> 18:27.574
one of their own cars.
Wouldn't they?

18:27.640 --> 18:29.376
And the funny thing is,
that's not what they
used to do here.

18:29.442 --> 18:30.410
-No.

18:30.477 --> 18:32.345
You don't surprise me.

18:32.412 --> 18:36.816
What they actually had for
many years, about 30 years,
was Porsches.

18:36.883 --> 18:39.852
-The police used Porsches,
yeah. Remember? Yeah.

18:39.919 --> 18:42.422
-Do you know, I'd forgotten.
You're right, they did.
-They did.

18:42.489 --> 18:44.491
How did they persuade
the government?

18:44.557 --> 18:47.026
It's masterful.
It's genius.

18:47.093 --> 18:48.628
Absolute respect
to everybody who did it.

18:48.695 --> 18:51.298
What they did was say,
"Right, we need...

18:51.364 --> 18:52.932
Hm. I think we need a Porsche

18:52.999 --> 18:56.002
because it's air-cooled and
the engine is at the back,

18:56.068 --> 19:00.072
and that would be handy
if we have to reverse at
high speed for a long time."

19:00.207 --> 19:01.341
They actually said that?

19:01.408 --> 19:02.775
They did.
And this gets better.

19:02.842 --> 19:05.245
And I'm not making this up.
They did say this.

19:05.312 --> 19:07.280
They need a car
where you can remove the roof

19:07.347 --> 19:11.384
so you can stand on the seats
to address traffic
in an emergency situation.

19:11.451 --> 19:14.287
So what they need
is a 911 Targa,

19:14.354 --> 19:16.856
and matching sunglasses,
I presume, yes.

19:16.923 --> 19:19.759
Did they also say, "And it
comes with 911 on the back

19:19.826 --> 19:21.628
which is our
telephone number"?

19:21.694 --> 19:24.264
The thing is, it doesn't,
and they're still at it,

19:24.331 --> 19:26.799
because the cycle cops
around here,

19:26.866 --> 19:28.034
and there's a lot of them,

19:28.100 --> 19:29.636
they managed to persuade
the government

19:29.702 --> 19:33.005
that they need
mountain bikes.

19:33.072 --> 19:34.707
-In Holland.

19:34.774 --> 19:37.410
It's the flattest country
on earth

19:37.477 --> 19:39.379
and they need mountain bikes!

19:39.446 --> 19:41.581
"Yes, I might see
a mountain." What?!

19:42.815 --> 19:43.916
The best thing...

19:47.987 --> 19:51.458
The best thing is,
it gives us an opportunity
to have one more look

19:51.524 --> 19:55.061
at a photograph of the
Dutch mountain cop police.

19:55.127 --> 19:57.564
-There they are.

19:57.630 --> 19:59.699
-Now, I want to talk about
otters.

19:59.766 --> 20:01.468
-I want to talk about otters.

20:01.534 --> 20:03.636
You see, a few years ago
somebody in Holland

20:03.703 --> 20:08.475
worked out that there were
only 185 otters
in the entire country.

20:08.541 --> 20:10.042
Yeah, Jeremy,
it's a car show.

20:10.109 --> 20:12.712
Bear with me, OK, because
I've got the figures here.

20:12.779 --> 20:17.550
In 2014,
21 of these otters
were run over.

20:17.617 --> 20:22.255
OK? In 2015,
49 were run over.

20:22.322 --> 20:25.558
You only have 185 otters
in the whole country,

20:25.625 --> 20:30.863
and in two years,
you've flattened 70 of them
under your cars.

20:30.930 --> 20:33.333
-What is your problem
with otters?!

20:33.400 --> 20:35.668
The thing is that
I don't want people to get
the wrong impression.

20:35.735 --> 20:39.406
I don't want everyone
to think that Dutch people
go around murdering animals.

20:39.472 --> 20:40.773
Let me explain.

20:40.840 --> 20:45.177
Recently, the government here
spent 150,000 euros,

20:45.244 --> 20:47.213
and that's Â£150,000,

20:47.280 --> 20:49.282
Â£160,000, Â£170,000...

20:49.349 --> 20:51.050
-That's Brexit for you.

20:51.117 --> 20:55.655
We can't even afford to put
mayonnaise on our chips now
any more.

20:55.722 --> 21:00.993
Er... Anyway,
they spent 150,000 euros
on a bridge over a road

21:01.060 --> 21:02.729
so squirrels
could cross safely.

21:02.795 --> 21:05.398
We've got a picture
of the bridge.
It's a substantial thing.

21:05.465 --> 21:07.133
You know this bridge?
A famous bridge?

21:07.199 --> 21:10.102
-Yeah, it's a squirrel bridge.

21:10.169 --> 21:13.906
Anyway, how many squirrels
do you think have used it?

21:15.141 --> 21:16.809
A squillion.

21:16.876 --> 21:19.979
I see where you're going
with that one, James.
No, it isn't.

21:20.046 --> 21:21.147
I've got the figures here.

21:21.213 --> 21:24.451
"CCTV footage
has revealed, in 2014,

21:24.517 --> 21:26.553
three squirrels used it.

21:26.619 --> 21:30.357
In 2015,
it was used only twice."

21:30.423 --> 21:34.661
Well, why didn't
the third squirrel
use it again in 2015?

21:34.727 --> 21:36.929
-It probably got run over.
-Yeah.

21:36.996 --> 21:39.799
By somebody mistaking him
for an otter.

21:39.866 --> 21:41.033
Get it! Get it!

21:42.402 --> 21:44.036
Now... Er...

21:44.103 --> 21:47.507
You've probably read
the other day,
the Dutch are taking a view

21:47.574 --> 21:49.676
on whether to allow
people to...

21:51.010 --> 21:53.413
How can I put this?
Assisted dying of somebody -

21:53.480 --> 21:56.749
feels as though
their life is complete, OK?

21:56.816 --> 21:58.785
This is something that
occupies me a lot,

21:58.851 --> 22:01.688
I'll be honest with you,
because I sometimes think...

22:01.754 --> 22:04.156
"Oh, have I done enough now?"

22:04.223 --> 22:05.858
OTHERS: Yes.
-No.

22:07.059 --> 22:08.395
No, you know, when?

22:08.461 --> 22:10.196
When would it be appropriate
for me to think,

22:10.262 --> 22:11.998
"Time to end."

22:12.064 --> 22:13.933
OTHERS: Now.
-No.

22:14.000 --> 22:18.137
-Yeah, do. Do it now.

22:18.204 --> 22:20.973
No, what I want to say is,
OK...

22:21.040 --> 22:22.575
I'll get the forms,
there can't be many.

22:22.642 --> 22:24.210
The time comes... Ssh!

22:24.276 --> 22:27.880
The time, I think, comes
when you stop wanting
to be an idiot.

22:27.947 --> 22:29.649
That's the time
when you've done enough.

22:29.716 --> 22:31.684
- I know what you mean.
- No, actually, you are right,

22:31.751 --> 22:34.253
cos I think it's the moment
where you go into
a big department store,

22:34.320 --> 22:38.257
and you go into
the kitchenware section,
and you see a tea cosy,

22:38.324 --> 22:39.792
but you don't
put it on your head.

22:39.859 --> 22:41.728
-Exactly.

22:41.794 --> 22:44.764
Not putting things
on your head
is a sign it's time.

22:44.831 --> 22:47.500
And the time you don't want to
put gloves on your ears

22:47.567 --> 22:49.436
and pretend to be a reindeer.

22:51.504 --> 22:54.441
-I think that's just you,
Hammond.

22:54.474 --> 22:56.443
Here's the moment
I think you know.

22:56.509 --> 22:59.546
You're driving up a motorway.
There's a train track
next to you.

22:59.612 --> 23:02.048
A train comes. It could be
one of those fast ones.

23:02.114 --> 23:05.351
The day when you don't try
and race the train,

23:05.452 --> 23:06.686
that's the day.

23:06.753 --> 23:08.521
-Yes.
-I have to race the train.

23:08.588 --> 23:10.490
I have to go faster
than the train

23:10.557 --> 23:12.291
so everyone on the train
looks at me and goes,

23:12.358 --> 23:13.960
"I've made the wrong
travel choice.

23:14.026 --> 23:16.062
"I should have gone
in the car. It's quicker."

23:16.128 --> 23:19.198
If you're ever on a train and
you look out of the window,

23:19.265 --> 23:22.001
you're overtaking me
and I can't be bothered
to race you,

23:22.068 --> 23:26.639
it's because I'm on my way to
the new Dutch death clinic.

23:26.706 --> 23:27.674
And that is the end of
Conversation Street.

23:27.740 --> 23:29.642
Now, if you have children,

23:29.709 --> 23:32.512
there's every chance
they'll spend every
spare second they have

23:32.579 --> 23:34.013
playing Zombie Splatter 7 ,

23:34.080 --> 23:36.215
or some other such
computer game,

23:36.282 --> 23:39.118
but what about
more traditional board games?

23:39.185 --> 23:42.622
Kids these days say they're not
interested in such games,

23:42.689 --> 23:46.258
but I believe they would be
if they were bigger

23:46.325 --> 23:48.160
and involved cars.

23:51.297 --> 23:52.899
To prove our point,

23:52.965 --> 23:56.503
we've come here,
to the countryside.

23:58.538 --> 24:00.406
And on the board-game front,

24:00.507 --> 24:02.274
we shall start with
a classic.

24:02.341 --> 24:05.812
A game where two players
try and guess where
each other's ships are,

24:05.878 --> 24:09.048
and then blow them up
by firing missiles at them.

24:09.115 --> 24:10.316
It's a simple game,

24:10.382 --> 24:13.319
and, as such, if you want
to play it with cars,

24:13.385 --> 24:14.954
you don't need much.

24:17.289 --> 24:19.526
In fact, all you need

24:19.592 --> 24:22.261
is a massive
former Cold War airfield

24:22.328 --> 24:26.633
with enough tarmac
to accommodate the board
for your board game.

24:28.935 --> 24:31.303
With a big enough slab
of airfield,

24:31.370 --> 24:32.972
you can then lay out
your grid,

24:33.039 --> 24:35.542
onto which you can place
your battleships.

24:35.608 --> 24:37.076
And all you need for that

24:37.143 --> 24:40.246
is several thousand pounds'
worth of old cars.

24:41.614 --> 24:43.616
But not any old cars.

24:43.683 --> 24:45.317
This stretch limo,
for example,

24:45.384 --> 24:49.055
may have seen active service
on hundreds of hen nights,

24:49.121 --> 24:53.092
but it makes
the perfect aircraft carrier.

24:53.159 --> 24:55.061
And then there's
this Toyota Prius.

24:55.127 --> 24:58.064
Its electric engine makes it
perfect as a submarine,

24:58.130 --> 24:59.632
silent running.

24:59.699 --> 25:03.069
And then there's this
Chrysler PT Cruiser
convertible.

25:03.135 --> 25:05.838
There is no naval equivalent
for this car,

25:05.905 --> 25:07.273
but who cares if
we blow it up?

25:07.339 --> 25:09.576
Because it is,
after all, crap.

25:09.576 --> 25:15.447
And speaking of blowing up,
we now come to the missiles.

25:15.582 --> 25:20.152
For these,
you need a car that is
frightening and lethal.

25:20.219 --> 25:24.657
A car that strikes fear
into other motorists.

25:24.724 --> 25:27.459
And what better car
could there be for this job

25:27.594 --> 25:29.796
than the magnificent G

25:30.997 --> 25:33.432
All I needed now
was an opponent,

25:33.499 --> 25:35.201
a board-game veteran,

25:35.267 --> 25:38.137
a man who thinks
Call Of Duty

25:38.204 --> 25:40.306
is a visit to
the lavatory.

25:40.372 --> 25:42.975
That's excellent, Hammond.
You've thought of everything.

25:43.042 --> 25:45.612
I know, I have.
Containers as the fence.

25:45.645 --> 25:47.847
A fireman, in case things
get out of hand.

25:47.914 --> 25:50.683
A health-and-safety bloke to
stop us blowing ourselves up.

25:50.750 --> 25:53.886
Cars that look exactly like
ships. The lot.

25:53.953 --> 25:56.122
But how will you fire
the missiles at the cars?

25:56.188 --> 26:00.660
Well,
that is the real genius
in my plan.

26:00.727 --> 26:02.995
Easy, powerful and proven.

26:03.062 --> 26:05.898
Fire the G-Wiz missiles
with the movie cannon.

26:05.965 --> 26:08.968
-You reckon
that's accurate enough?
-Well, it's a cannon.

26:09.035 --> 26:10.903
But you've got to hit
a specific square.

26:10.970 --> 26:14.707
You aim the cannon.
You adjust the trajectory
and the elevation.

26:14.774 --> 26:17.644
-It's a cannon.

26:17.644 --> 26:20.780
To shut James up,
I took one of the spare cars

26:20.847 --> 26:22.949
to demonstrate
a practice shot.

26:24.283 --> 26:25.918
Right, we're all set.

26:25.985 --> 26:28.354
It's fully charged.
Pressure's good. Fire.

26:38.831 --> 26:42.334
JAMES: I had a better idea
for the weapons-launching
system.

26:56.683 --> 26:58.150
So, there you go.

26:58.217 --> 27:00.552
You call out
the grid reference
that you want,

27:00.687 --> 27:03.923
and the driver just
manoeuvres the jib
exactly over that square,

27:03.990 --> 27:05.692
and then drops
the G-Wiz missile.

27:05.692 --> 27:08.327
It is absolutely
unerringly accurate.

27:08.394 --> 27:09.962
I like that.

27:10.029 --> 27:13.733
Unlike everything else
I've done here,
with all this stuff,

27:13.800 --> 27:17.970
this is all things you can do
at home in your garden.

27:18.037 --> 27:20.006
RICHARD:
With the giant containers

27:20.072 --> 27:25.177
making sure
neither of us could see
what the other was doing,

27:25.244 --> 27:29.415
...James and I moved
our battleships into place.

27:31.417 --> 27:35.788
And with the board laid out,
it was time to play.

27:35.855 --> 27:39.158
Right, the hen-night limos
each require two hits
to be sunk.

27:39.225 --> 27:43.095
Both the motorhomes,
they each require two hits
to be sunk as well.

27:43.162 --> 27:45.932
And then my Prius
and your PT Cruiser,

27:45.998 --> 27:48.100
they each require one
to be sunk.

27:48.167 --> 27:50.770
We've got ten G-Wiz missiles
each.

27:50.837 --> 27:52.972
Five hits needed to win.
Got it?

27:53.840 --> 27:55.541
Yes, right.

27:55.607 --> 27:59.245
Having won the toss,
James would be first to fire,

27:59.311 --> 28:02.381
but I had a cunning plan
to thwart him.

28:02.448 --> 28:06.953
What I've done
is put a couple of my ships
right out on the edges,

28:07.019 --> 28:10.456
because James will think,
"Hammond's a bit thick,

28:10.522 --> 28:13.793
and it's a typically
amateurish tactic to put
your ships on the edge,

28:13.860 --> 28:15.127
so that's what
he'll have done."

28:15.194 --> 28:17.129
But then he'll think,
"Hang on.

28:17.196 --> 28:19.131
Even Hammond's
not that thick.

28:19.198 --> 28:21.333
He just wants me
to think he's thick,

28:21.400 --> 28:24.003
so he'll have put his cars
in the middle."

28:24.070 --> 28:26.638
James will then
not go for the edges,

28:26.773 --> 28:28.274
he'll go for the middle.

28:28.340 --> 28:31.077
But my ships
will be at the edges.

28:31.143 --> 28:34.680
It's like a... double,
or even a triple bluff.

28:34.781 --> 28:36.348
Now, Hammond is a bit thick,
really,

28:36.415 --> 28:39.418
so I reckon he'll have put his
all around the edges.

28:41.653 --> 28:43.890
D2, please.

28:47.226 --> 28:48.360
Fire!

28:58.938 --> 29:02.809
-It was my limo.

29:02.842 --> 29:06.145
Hit on your limo on D2,
thank you. Your shot.

29:09.115 --> 29:13.685
Red crane driver,
I'd like C4, please. C4.

29:13.820 --> 29:15.054
Fire!

29:21.828 --> 29:24.663
That's a miss.

29:24.730 --> 29:27.599
C4, miss.

29:27.666 --> 29:29.168
Back to my original theory.

29:29.235 --> 29:30.569
Hammond will have gone
along the edge,

29:30.636 --> 29:31.838
I'm pretty confident
in that.

29:31.904 --> 29:34.506
So is it there,
or is it there?

29:34.573 --> 29:39.145
Green crane driver,
fire at D1.

29:39.211 --> 29:40.346
Fire!

29:46.886 --> 29:50.622
-Yes!
-You sank my limousine!

29:50.689 --> 29:56.395
One sinking to me,
a miss for Admiral Hammond.

29:56.462 --> 29:59.031
And you've overdone
the explosives.

30:01.300 --> 30:03.369
One plan would be,
if you're playing this
at home,

30:03.435 --> 30:06.305
do it on a day when there's
a lot of barbecues in the area.

30:06.372 --> 30:08.374
That way,
people will just think,
"Well, yeah,

30:08.440 --> 30:11.243
it's a big barbecue
they're having next door."

30:12.644 --> 30:14.513
RICHARD:
With my aircraft carrier
gone

30:14.580 --> 30:19.185
and James's fleet unscathed,
I had to break my duck.

30:19.251 --> 30:22.154
I'd like you to hit B2,
please.

30:25.524 --> 30:26.893
Damn!

30:26.959 --> 30:28.360
B2. Well...

30:28.427 --> 30:30.429
Well, there's no...
Where are they?!

30:30.496 --> 30:31.797
I've just got a feeling.

30:31.864 --> 30:34.901
B1. B1, please.

30:42.341 --> 30:45.477
Red crane driver,
can I have square A1?

30:47.914 --> 30:49.415
Fire!

30:53.085 --> 30:54.653
HAMMOND: Oooh! Ooh-hoo-hoo!

30:54.720 --> 30:56.422
Yes! Come on!

30:56.488 --> 30:59.825
Oh, you are on the run!
That is it! Want to give up?

30:59.892 --> 31:02.128
You've sunk my Cruiser.

31:02.194 --> 31:07.033
So that's a big red kill
on A1. Boom!

31:07.099 --> 31:10.036
But James wasn't taking this
lying down.

31:11.670 --> 31:14.440
C3. Fire!

31:18.410 --> 31:19.511
Yes!

31:19.578 --> 31:20.579
You hit my submarine,

31:20.646 --> 31:22.949
my invisible,
silent-running Prius.

31:25.284 --> 31:27.219
RICHARD: I am losing badly.

31:27.286 --> 31:29.989
I've scored only one hit,
he's scored three.

31:31.257 --> 31:33.325
But then
the game started to turn,

31:33.392 --> 31:36.762
as James had a run
of three straight misses.

31:36.828 --> 31:38.197
JAMES:  Fire!

31:46.838 --> 31:48.540
It was a miss! Ha-ha!

31:48.607 --> 31:51.010
Thank you.
I'm closing down my options.

31:51.077 --> 31:55.814
It would close your options
down further if you were to
hit rather than miss.

31:55.881 --> 31:59.685
Which was exactly
what I was now doing.

31:59.751 --> 32:00.987
B3, please.

32:04.490 --> 32:06.225
A3, please.

32:10.529 --> 32:11.797
Yes!

32:11.863 --> 32:14.333
You've sunk my battleship.

32:14.400 --> 32:16.568
I am raining down destruction

32:16.635 --> 32:19.171
on your dwindling fleet
of doomed ships.

32:19.238 --> 32:20.672
You loser. Ha-ha!

32:20.739 --> 32:23.509
No, I'm not losing.
We're neck and neck.

32:24.710 --> 32:27.113
Annoyingly,
James was right.

32:27.179 --> 32:29.681
I still had my battleship
Winnebago,

32:29.748 --> 32:32.851
and he still had his
stretched aircraft carrier,

32:32.918 --> 32:36.688
both of which needed
two hits to destroy.

32:36.755 --> 32:38.490
It was May's turn to play.

32:41.027 --> 32:42.394
B2.

32:42.461 --> 32:45.031
RICHARD: Critical stage
of the game now.

32:45.031 --> 32:46.732
A hit now and I'm in trouble.

32:47.933 --> 32:49.335
Fire!

32:50.536 --> 32:51.570
Come on.

32:54.806 --> 32:57.243
Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!

32:57.309 --> 33:00.579
It shouldn't
feel so good, but it does.

33:01.680 --> 33:03.282
Oh.

33:06.052 --> 33:08.354
It's gonna be here.

33:08.420 --> 33:11.523
Red crane,
target C1, please. C1.

33:13.625 --> 33:14.626
Fire!

33:18.064 --> 33:20.532
Hard luck, Horatio Hammond.

33:22.968 --> 33:24.770
All I've got to do now,

33:24.836 --> 33:26.772
get inside
Richard Hammond's mind.

33:26.838 --> 33:30.942
An awful place, admittedly,
but if I can just
get in there for a second,

33:31.077 --> 33:32.744
which way has he put it?

33:32.811 --> 33:35.347
There and there;
there and there;
there and there?

33:41.920 --> 33:43.255
C2.

33:48.094 --> 33:49.361
Fire!

33:55.367 --> 33:57.569
That'll be a miss.

33:59.705 --> 34:04.476
That, Captain May,
was a miss!

34:07.479 --> 34:12.251
However, while James
now had to choose between
just two squares,

34:12.318 --> 34:14.786
I was looking at
a choice of six.

34:16.155 --> 34:19.291
Red crane,
target C2, please. C2.

34:24.230 --> 34:27.133
Red crane, fire!

34:27.166 --> 34:28.700
I meant C3! I meant...

34:33.572 --> 34:34.773
Yes!

34:34.840 --> 34:38.144
Oh, yes! Yes!

34:38.210 --> 34:40.679
Bollocks.

34:40.746 --> 34:44.816
RICHARD: That mistaken shot
wasn't just a hit,

34:44.883 --> 34:46.952
it had changed everything.

34:47.018 --> 34:49.788
Because I said C2,
when actually I meant three,

34:49.855 --> 34:51.723
in case it was there,

34:51.790 --> 34:53.225
that's a kill - bang -

34:53.292 --> 34:54.860
which means
it has to be there.

34:54.926 --> 34:57.263
It can't be here or here,
so I've got him.

34:57.329 --> 34:59.298
James, you do know
what that means, don't you?

34:59.365 --> 35:00.932
Yes,
I've just worked it out.

35:00.999 --> 35:03.535
I've got to get this right,
otherwise you've won.

35:03.602 --> 35:07.606
-No, I don't!

35:07.673 --> 35:10.509
JAMES: So, I was
now faced with the choice

35:10.576 --> 35:12.744
that would decide the game.

35:14.180 --> 35:17.649
A2 or B3?

35:17.716 --> 35:20.519
A2, B3. What would
Richard Hammond do?

35:23.289 --> 35:24.556
Green-crane driver...

35:28.694 --> 35:29.895
Oh, God.

35:34.300 --> 35:36.835
Come on, you bewildered
old spaniel - miss.

35:39.238 --> 35:41.440
Right. Fire!

35:54.986 --> 35:57.623
Yes! Yes!

35:57.689 --> 35:58.757
Ha-ha!

36:02.228 --> 36:04.563
Oh, God!

36:04.630 --> 36:05.797
Ha-ha-ha!

36:05.864 --> 36:06.998
Yes!

36:09.235 --> 36:10.436
Hammond!

36:12.238 --> 36:14.373
RICHARD:
Best of three?

36:17.876 --> 36:20.145
JEREMY: I bet...

36:20.246 --> 36:23.349
I bet the makers
of Sony PlayStation
are quaking in their boots.

36:23.415 --> 36:25.016
Well,
I wouldn't be surprised.

36:25.083 --> 36:27.519
-They will go, "Oh, my..."
-I know. There's the future.

36:27.586 --> 36:30.689
-That was
a total waste of time.
-Well, now, hang on.

36:30.756 --> 36:34.393
No, we destroyed
a PT Cruiser, a Prius
and many G-Wizs.

36:34.460 --> 36:36.728
Well, that's true, yes.
But James...

36:36.795 --> 36:38.163
James?

36:40.065 --> 36:45.471
Never mind. Let's move on to
Celebrity Brain Crash.

36:51.277 --> 36:52.978
JEREMY: Yeah. Now...

36:55.781 --> 36:57.516
This week...

36:57.583 --> 37:00.652
This week,
we don't just have one star,

37:00.719 --> 37:02.488
we have several.

37:02.554 --> 37:04.356
They're one of
the biggest bands

37:04.423 --> 37:06.392
ever to come out of Holland,

37:06.458 --> 37:07.659
and they're going to
begin here,

37:07.726 --> 37:12.298
in the sixth largest port
in the world...

37:12.298 --> 37:13.799
by performing
their biggest hit,

37:13.865 --> 37:16.368
by which I mean...
their hit.

37:16.435 --> 37:19.137
Ladies and gentlemen,
Golden Earring!

37:21.307 --> 37:22.408
RICHARD: And there they are.

37:22.474 --> 37:23.809
I tell you what,

37:23.875 --> 37:25.877
we ought to make the lights go
a bit better.

37:25.944 --> 37:28.847
Can we dim the lights?
That's better.
A bit more rock 'n' roll.

37:28.914 --> 37:30.081
What is their hit?

37:30.148 --> 37:33.218
Well, this is Holland,
birthplace of the speed camera.

37:33.319 --> 37:35.053
It's obvious.
Radar Love.

37:39.925 --> 37:43.028
* I've been drivin' all night
My hands wet on the wheel *

37:49.335 --> 37:50.702
RICHARD: Oh...

37:51.903 --> 37:54.840
JEREMY: OK,
ladies and gentlemen, erm...

37:54.906 --> 37:58.344
...there's a cable's gone
into the sea here, and...

37:58.344 --> 38:00.912
...Golden Earring
have been electrocuted.

38:02.581 --> 38:04.416
Does that mean
they're not coming on, then?

38:04.483 --> 38:07.819
Well, James,
they've been subjected to
a lethal dose of electricity

38:07.886 --> 38:10.822
and are now lying
on the ground, sizzling,
so it's no.

38:10.889 --> 38:12.958
-They're not, no.
-OK, OK.

38:13.024 --> 38:15.927
That is a very grisly scene.
I apologise for that,
everybody.

38:15.994 --> 38:18.029
Erm... Probably not
as grisly, though,

38:18.096 --> 38:21.066
as if you're looking at us
from out there.

38:21.132 --> 38:22.768
-Well, think about it.

38:24.269 --> 38:26.104
-Oh, yeah!
-Yeah.

38:26.171 --> 38:28.907
We are standing in a window
in a Dutch port,

38:28.974 --> 38:30.041
bathed in red light...

38:31.443 --> 38:33.144
...and we've got no trade
lining up.

38:33.211 --> 38:34.513
-Nobody's here.
-No.

38:34.580 --> 38:36.748
No, I know! I know!
I've had an idea.

38:36.815 --> 38:39.751
I've had an idea
of how we can fill the time

38:39.818 --> 38:42.253
that would have been taken up
by the late Golden Earring.

38:42.388 --> 38:44.022
You see, the thing is...

38:44.089 --> 38:46.758
Can we make the lights
go white again now?
Pretend that never happened.

38:46.825 --> 38:48.960
Good. See, the thing is that,
in Holland,

38:49.027 --> 38:51.730
there are these motorist
accessory stores, OK?

38:51.797 --> 38:54.165
-Oh, yeah.
-They're open all night.
The place is full.

38:54.232 --> 38:57.503
We went to one last night
and bought a load
of amazing stuff

38:57.569 --> 39:00.138
you can use on the road.

39:00.205 --> 39:02.441
Bring it over here.
Let's show you
a couple of things,

39:02.508 --> 39:03.542
I mean, this,
for example.

39:03.609 --> 39:05.076
It's an incredible
safety device.

39:05.143 --> 39:06.612
-Yeah.

39:06.678 --> 39:10.416
This is very clever, because
in a lot of car crashes,

39:10.416 --> 39:12.651
people bite their tongues,
sometimes off.

39:12.718 --> 39:15.487
But by wearing this neat
safety device,

39:15.554 --> 39:16.855
no way is he
biting his tongue.

39:16.922 --> 39:18.790
Look at that!
Perfectly safe.
That is clever.

39:18.857 --> 39:20.626
Unbelievable.
And then you can
get traffic cones

39:20.692 --> 39:22.761
that fit in
the glovebox.

39:22.828 --> 39:24.463
-This is one here.

39:26.031 --> 39:28.500
RICHARD: Yeah.
-It's not funny stuff,
this is safety material.

39:28.567 --> 39:32.103
-Another one.
-These are compact, so you
can fit them in your boot.

39:32.170 --> 39:34.706
The thing is, though,
OK, in America,

39:34.773 --> 39:37.543
as I'm sure you know,
there are high-occupancy
vehicle lanes.

39:37.609 --> 39:40.178
Er... You're not allowed
to go in them

39:40.245 --> 39:42.714
unless you've got two
or more people in the car.

39:42.781 --> 39:44.450
We've always been
very worried in Europe

39:44.450 --> 39:46.452
that this idea is
gonna come over here,

39:46.518 --> 39:48.754
but the Dutch
have it covered,

39:48.820 --> 39:51.657
because in these
motorist accessory shops,

39:51.723 --> 39:53.592
you can buy
inflatable people.

39:53.659 --> 39:55.193
-We've got one here.

39:55.260 --> 39:57.295
-Very clever, this.
Very clever.

39:57.362 --> 40:00.265
The only slight issue is
they do take a lot of effort
to blow up.

40:00.331 --> 40:01.967
It's hard work doing.

40:02.033 --> 40:04.936
It doesn't matter, though,
because here's the thing.

40:05.003 --> 40:07.606
OK, if you arrive
at one of those

40:07.673 --> 40:09.708
high-occupancy
vehicle lanes,

40:09.775 --> 40:11.943
then you pull over
on the hard shoulder -

40:12.010 --> 40:14.480
just pass the Dutchie
on the left-hand side here -

40:14.546 --> 40:16.982
and then use your engine
to blow up

40:17.048 --> 40:19.117
your inflatable person.

40:19.184 --> 40:24.289
So I'm going to do that now,
just to show you how
unbelievably easy this is.

40:24.355 --> 40:25.757
Are we ready?

40:25.824 --> 40:28.126
I'll just er...
put a bit of fuel in there.

40:28.193 --> 40:29.861
And here we go.

40:29.928 --> 40:32.764
Why have you put your fingers
in your ears? It's only a V8.

40:32.831 --> 40:34.365
It's virtually silent.

40:36.301 --> 40:37.736
Here we go.

40:38.837 --> 40:40.906
Behold.

40:44.275 --> 40:45.944
What the...?

40:58.289 --> 40:59.958
Right, the erm...

41:00.025 --> 41:02.327
The inflatable person
has split. There's--

41:02.528 --> 41:04.229
Oh, dear.

41:04.295 --> 41:05.697
Mine's all right.

41:07.198 --> 41:10.135
Let's move on, shall we?
Tonight we are in Morocco,

41:10.201 --> 41:15.541
for what was supposed to be
a sensible sports-car test
of my Mazda MX-5

41:15.574 --> 41:19.177
versus Bob Marley's
Norfolk-built Zenos.

41:19.244 --> 41:23.214
Unfortunately,
the ape turned up, uninvited,

41:23.281 --> 41:25.984
in a ridiculously expensive
Alfa Romeo.

41:26.051 --> 41:27.586
Yes, I did.

41:27.653 --> 41:29.220
And when we left the action,

41:29.287 --> 41:32.991
I decided to see which of
the cars was the lightest

41:33.058 --> 41:35.761
by building
some rudimentary scales -

41:35.827 --> 41:40.566
a job that these two thought
would be... beyond me.

41:47.005 --> 41:49.775
JEREMY: Despite the cynicism
of my colleagues,

41:49.841 --> 41:52.811
the next morning,
my scales were ready.

42:03.822 --> 42:05.757
-Wow.
-Yeah.

42:05.824 --> 42:10.629
JAMES: Even more startling
was Jeremy's choice
of counterweight.

42:10.696 --> 42:12.497
How are you gonna
get it on there?

42:12.598 --> 42:14.600
-It's gonna jump.
-Oh, yeah,
they're big jumpers, cows.

42:14.600 --> 42:15.701
-Look, it wants to.
-He's limbering up,

42:15.767 --> 42:17.603
he's getting ready,
you can tell.

42:17.603 --> 42:20.305
-Up you come.
-It's not gonna jump.
They can't jump.

42:20.371 --> 42:22.941
Up you come.

42:23.008 --> 42:25.811
On the off chance that
this isn't a jumping cow,

42:25.877 --> 42:28.647
which it might not be,
I think you need a ramp.

42:28.714 --> 42:31.617
You hold that.
I shall go and make a ramp.

42:31.683 --> 42:33.251
-Hello. Hello.
-Hello, nice cow.

42:33.318 --> 42:36.354
Oh, it's bonded with you,
Jeremy. It's bonded.

42:36.421 --> 42:38.857
JEREMY: Soon,
without any help at all,

42:38.924 --> 42:41.760
I had fashioned
a makeshift ramp.

42:43.862 --> 42:44.963
RICHARD:
Very good. Well done.

42:45.030 --> 42:46.865
That was quick and effective.

42:46.932 --> 42:50.101
JEREMY: Unfortunately,
the cow had wandered off,

42:50.168 --> 42:53.438
so I had to draft in
a substitute.

42:53.504 --> 42:55.273
-Go on, camel.

42:55.340 --> 42:56.642
-Come on, camel.
-Come on.

42:56.642 --> 42:58.209
Come on, camel. Come on.

42:59.811 --> 43:01.647
Come on. Come on.

43:01.647 --> 43:03.782
He's not gonna go on.

43:03.849 --> 43:05.550
Up you come. Come on.

43:05.651 --> 43:07.252
Come on.
Can you push him? Oh, no.

43:07.318 --> 43:10.889
Not really,
cos they kick your balls off
if you do that. Let me...

43:10.956 --> 43:13.759
David Attenborough
has never said that.

43:13.825 --> 43:16.795
JEREMY: Eventually,
I had some success.

43:16.862 --> 43:18.263
This is good.
We are getting there.

43:18.329 --> 43:20.531
We are building up
a big Christmas dinner.

43:20.666 --> 43:24.202
JEREMY: And then
the original cow came back.

43:25.470 --> 43:27.238
-Come on.
RICHARD: Dr Thinklittle.

43:27.305 --> 43:30.441
JEREMY: Come on. Come on.
RICHARD: My camel's going
over here.

43:30.508 --> 43:31.843
Good cow.

43:33.945 --> 43:36.281
-Tragically, however...
-...it's not enough.

43:36.347 --> 43:38.950
Could you go
and get another cow?

43:39.918 --> 43:41.753
Come on, small cow.

43:41.820 --> 43:43.421
JEREMY:
He's on. Right, excellent.

43:43.488 --> 43:44.790
-Good, good, good.

43:44.856 --> 43:46.257
-This is far...

43:46.324 --> 43:49.194
-Oh, my God!
-I don't want to be here
for this!

43:49.260 --> 43:52.163
I'm on some scales.
Its carrot's come out.

43:52.230 --> 43:54.232
-Yeah, they're both boys.

43:54.299 --> 43:57.836
Yeah. Oh, no.
This is quite bad.

43:57.903 --> 43:59.570
-I'm... Yeah.
-I really am alarmed.

43:59.705 --> 44:01.707
I'm stuck on a porn set.

44:03.341 --> 44:05.276
Am I part of this?
Is this a threesome?

44:05.343 --> 44:07.545
He's trod on a turk...
No, he hasn't.

44:07.612 --> 44:11.016
JEREMY:
More importantly, the whole
cast of our porn film

44:11.082 --> 44:14.352
still weighed less
than the Mazda.

44:14.419 --> 44:16.855
Chickens. Hello, chickies.

44:16.922 --> 44:18.489
-No.

44:18.556 --> 44:22.293
It doesn't make... Jeremy,
this is complete nonsense.

44:22.360 --> 44:24.262
RICHARD: Cow sex! No!

44:25.530 --> 44:28.099
Come on, we go. On you go.

44:28.166 --> 44:29.901
RICHARD: I'm not convinced
that this isn't...

44:29.968 --> 44:31.770
Oh, the goat's escaped.

44:31.837 --> 44:34.372
RICHARD: At this stage,
we explained to Jeremy

44:34.439 --> 44:38.309
that animals cannot be used
as counterweights.

44:38.376 --> 44:40.045
Right, no,
you may have a point.

44:40.111 --> 44:42.748
I think it's better
if I kill them.

44:42.814 --> 44:45.250
-Well, if they're dead,
they won't mind.

44:47.318 --> 44:50.756
JEREMY: This plan
made the job much easier.

44:52.523 --> 44:53.759
JEREMY: Oh, hello!

44:53.792 --> 44:56.327
My experiment has worked.

44:56.394 --> 44:57.495
Wow! We have a figure.

44:57.562 --> 44:59.898
JAMES: For the record,
it weighs two cows,

44:59.965 --> 45:01.967
two legs of cows -
brackets, rear -

45:02.033 --> 45:03.468
one camel and three goats.

45:03.534 --> 45:05.070
That's incredible!

45:05.136 --> 45:07.338
The most exciting thing
I've ever been involved in.

45:08.840 --> 45:11.777
JEREMY: Having established
the weight of the Mazda,

45:11.777 --> 45:13.945
it was time to do the Zenos.

45:15.280 --> 45:18.784
JEREMY: Hammond, reverse off
down my superb ramp.

45:20.218 --> 45:21.987
-Whoa! It's...
-I'm gonna walk this way.

45:22.053 --> 45:24.289
Why is it doing that? James
counterbalances with you.

45:24.355 --> 45:26.391
JEREMY: Hang on.
That's not gone well.

45:26.457 --> 45:28.326
JAMES: Yeah, it has.
-No, it's moved!

45:29.795 --> 45:32.663
RICHARD: Oh, this is...
Now the back wheels
have come off!

45:32.798 --> 45:34.800
Somebody get on!
The whole crew!

45:37.702 --> 45:39.370
JAMES: Oh, God!

45:39.437 --> 45:41.672
JEREMY: No, there's no point
doing that, Hammond.

45:41.807 --> 45:43.809
We need to
think this through.

45:46.845 --> 45:48.179
Hang on. I've got an idea.

45:48.246 --> 45:50.615
If you get off there,
this side will go up.

45:50.681 --> 45:53.418
Then you put the ramp
under the back wheels
of the Mazda

45:53.484 --> 45:54.886
when it comes down again.

45:54.953 --> 45:58.456
-So you all need to get off.
-Right, I'm off.

46:01.827 --> 46:04.062
Hang on.
Are you going up now?

46:04.129 --> 46:05.663
-I think so.
-No, we need...

46:05.730 --> 46:07.198
I know,
everybody has to go there.

46:07.265 --> 46:09.100
-On that side. Yeah.
-Everybody, all the crew.

46:09.167 --> 46:13.071
All the chunkier lads,
if you get on that one.

46:13.138 --> 46:15.006
JEREMY: How did we get
into this position?

46:15.073 --> 46:17.208
Somebody pull on the front,
just to tip it.

46:17.275 --> 46:19.845
JEREMY: And then
we will move this ramp.

46:19.878 --> 46:21.712
Hello? Can we have all of...

46:21.847 --> 46:23.915
-He's down now!
RICHARD: Am I gonna die?

46:24.850 --> 46:27.018
Am I dead

46:29.187 --> 46:30.856
JEREMY:
Thanks to our fluent French,

46:30.856 --> 46:35.260
we were able to get the
forklift driver to help us.

46:35.326 --> 46:37.162
The Mazda...

46:37.228 --> 46:38.429
Erm...

46:42.100 --> 46:44.435
JAMES:
Reverse Ã  vous la ramp,

46:44.502 --> 46:47.238
avec introduce la ramp...
Yeah.

46:48.506 --> 46:51.376
JEREMY: Then
the authorities arrived.

46:51.442 --> 46:53.711
-Yes, les animaux.

46:53.778 --> 46:55.113
Wait. Erm...

46:56.147 --> 46:57.315
Is it a ProblÃ¨me?

46:57.382 --> 47:01.386
James, it's not acceptable
in Morocco

47:01.452 --> 47:04.890
to kill animals to establish
the weight of a car, so...

47:04.923 --> 47:06.992
It's not acceptable
in Morocco?

47:07.058 --> 47:09.027
JEREMY: Having established
nothing at all,

47:09.094 --> 47:10.561
we were all ordered
to leave,

47:10.628 --> 47:13.398
which made Hammond
very cheesed off with me.

47:13.464 --> 47:15.466
RICHARD:
You're a bloody idiot!

47:15.533 --> 47:16.902
JEREMY: Funny!

47:18.436 --> 47:20.238
I think he's angry,
isn't he?

47:20.305 --> 47:23.341
And I wasn't in James's
good books, either.

47:24.675 --> 47:26.344
Clarkson!

47:26.411 --> 47:27.412
What's the matter?

47:27.478 --> 47:30.115
I want the steering wheel
back, you muppet!

47:30.181 --> 47:31.549
-I haven't got it.
-You have!

47:31.616 --> 47:33.985
I haven't. One of those goats
has got it.

47:34.052 --> 47:35.954
Goats can't pick things up.

47:42.693 --> 47:46.231
RICHARD: With his wheel
retrieved, we set off.

47:46.297 --> 47:48.799
And soon,
James and I decided

47:48.934 --> 47:51.469
something
needed to be done.

47:51.536 --> 47:53.471
Jeremy, are you there?

47:53.538 --> 47:55.640
Yes, I am.

47:55.706 --> 47:57.142
Oh, good. Erm...

47:57.208 --> 47:58.743
Look, just...

47:58.809 --> 48:01.112
Er...
Just bear with me, OK?

48:01.179 --> 48:05.416
This isn't really working
as well as we'd hoped
at the moment,

48:05.483 --> 48:09.587
so we think
it would be better
if we went our own way

48:09.654 --> 48:11.256
and you went yours.

48:13.858 --> 48:16.194
Are you in on this, James?

48:16.261 --> 48:20.966
Well, the thing is
that we had conceived
quite an interesting test

48:20.999 --> 48:24.402
between
an everyday sports car
and a hardcore sports car.

48:24.469 --> 48:26.704
And, I mean,
it's not you.

48:26.771 --> 48:29.975
But, I mean, really,
it's the Alfa.
The Alfa doesn't fit.

48:31.809 --> 48:33.811
Right, well, OK. Erm...

48:33.878 --> 48:35.713
I'll leave you two alone.

48:35.780 --> 48:37.348
And I do mean alone,

48:37.415 --> 48:40.986
because... I'm going to take
the film crews with me.

48:48.759 --> 48:49.995
Now that we're alone,

48:50.061 --> 48:53.264
I could prattle on for hours

48:53.331 --> 48:57.002
about what
the Alfa Romeo badge means,

48:57.035 --> 48:59.337
and how,
with its carbon-fibre tub,

48:59.404 --> 49:01.106
this isn't really
a sports car.

49:01.172 --> 49:05.110
It's more a... scaled-down,
cut-price LaFerrari.

49:06.277 --> 49:08.079
But I've had a better idea.

49:12.650 --> 49:16.454
What I did was find
a wonderful piece of road...

49:21.092 --> 49:22.827
...and then shut up,

49:22.893 --> 49:25.596
so the pictures
could do the talking.

49:31.269 --> 49:35.806
* Round,
like a circle in a spiral *

49:35.873 --> 49:38.776
* Like a wheel
within a wheel *

49:38.843 --> 49:43.514
* Like the circles
that you find *

49:43.581 --> 49:51.756
* In the windmills
of your mind *

49:51.822 --> 49:55.226
* Like a tunnel
that you follow *

49:55.293 --> 49:59.197
* To a tunnel of its own *

50:00.298 --> 50:03.501
* Down a hollow
to a cavern *

50:03.568 --> 50:08.339
* Where the sun
has never shone *

50:08.406 --> 50:12.077
* Like a door
That keeps revolving *

50:12.143 --> 50:16.947
* In a half-forgotten
dream *

50:17.014 --> 50:18.583
* Or the ripples *

50:18.649 --> 50:24.889
* From a pebble
someone tosses in a stream *

50:24.955 --> 50:28.559
* Like a clock
whose hands are sweeping *

50:28.626 --> 50:33.331
* Past the minutes
of its face *

50:33.398 --> 50:36.701
* And the world
is like an apple *

50:36.767 --> 50:41.406
* Whirling silently
in space *

50:41.472 --> 50:44.775
* Like the circles
that you find *

50:44.842 --> 50:52.583
* In the windmills
of your mind *

50:56.387 --> 50:57.855
That's the thing
about this Alfa -

50:57.922 --> 51:00.925
if you talk about it,
you're gonna criticise it.

51:00.991 --> 51:05.530
If you just look at it...
you're gonna fall in love.
Oh, hello.

51:07.165 --> 51:10.135
Mate! Mate!
Thank God you're here!

51:11.669 --> 51:13.037
JEREMY:
What's the matter with him?

51:13.138 --> 51:14.805
Well, for the first time
in my life,

51:14.872 --> 51:18.443
I'm rather glad you're here,
because...

51:18.509 --> 51:21.011
he thinks he's discovered
an ancient civilisation.

51:21.146 --> 51:22.647
And he got very excited,

51:22.713 --> 51:25.150
and I couldn't say,
"No, Hammond, it's not real."

51:25.150 --> 51:26.517
It's a film set.

51:26.584 --> 51:29.287
That is where they filmed
Asterix And Obelix ,

51:29.354 --> 51:31.689
and that is where they film
Game Of Thrones .

51:31.756 --> 51:33.424
Yeah, I know that,
but he thinks it's real.

51:33.491 --> 51:35.260
He thinks
aliens have come down

51:35.326 --> 51:38.729
and that everything
that universities in Britain
know about Ancient Egypt,

51:38.796 --> 51:41.232
Ancient Greece,
Ancient Rome, is all wrong.

51:47.037 --> 51:49.374
Which feet
last trod these steps?

51:50.808 --> 51:52.210
Were they even human?

51:55.980 --> 51:57.915
Maybe they were that big.

51:57.982 --> 52:00.285
This was actually used in
The Jewel Of The Nile .

52:00.351 --> 52:01.652
-Yeah.

52:01.719 --> 52:05.823
Starring Kathleen Turner,
Michael Douglas,

52:05.890 --> 52:07.825
and, I think, Danny DeVito.

52:07.892 --> 52:10.561
Hammond probably thinks
that it's a spaceship.

52:10.628 --> 52:12.663
-That's how they got here.

52:16.000 --> 52:18.203
It's like touching hands...

52:18.269 --> 52:20.438
...across the millennia.

52:22.407 --> 52:24.775
These were not
primitive people.

52:27.812 --> 52:29.514
JEREMY:
While Indiana Hammond

52:29.580 --> 52:31.916
continued
his deluded ramblings,

52:31.982 --> 52:33.651
I came up with an idea.

52:35.586 --> 52:38.889
I tell you what this place
has never been used as.

52:38.956 --> 52:41.226
-A racetrack.

52:43.794 --> 52:45.430
JEREMY:
Having convinced Richard

52:45.496 --> 52:47.965
we wouldn't anger
the sleeping gods,

52:48.032 --> 52:52.870
we made a circuit
from the roads running
through the studio lot.

52:55.406 --> 52:59.076
And then I went off
to get changed.

52:59.143 --> 53:01.379
Wow! Hammond,
Roger Moore isn't here.

53:01.446 --> 53:03.448
No, he's not, is he?
What is that?

53:03.514 --> 53:05.850
It's my Alfa Romeo
racing suit.

53:05.916 --> 53:07.685
-Yes, it is. Look at that.

53:07.752 --> 53:09.420
RICHARD: Oh!
JEREMY: Peacock lining.

53:09.487 --> 53:10.655
RICHARD:
That makes it better.

53:10.721 --> 53:12.257
It's the Dick
from Del Monte.

53:12.323 --> 53:14.124
-The Cock from Del Monte.

53:14.259 --> 53:16.060
The Dick from Del Monte,
he says, "Ra-ra-ra!"

53:16.126 --> 53:19.129
-In an Alfa Romeo--
JAMES: This is tremendous!

53:19.264 --> 53:22.099
In an Alfa Romeo...

53:22.166 --> 53:25.002
...looking good is more
important than looking
where you're going.

53:25.069 --> 53:26.837
-That's a shame.

53:29.274 --> 53:32.443
JEREMY: It was now time
to get down to business.

53:32.510 --> 53:35.846
But first, we went out
for some sighting laps.

53:37.915 --> 53:40.285
JAMES: Whoa!

53:40.318 --> 53:42.820
It's all skiddy!

53:42.887 --> 53:45.756
-Oh, this is very narrow.
James did this.

53:45.823 --> 53:49.694
That's only an inch wider
than my car, you stupid man!

53:49.760 --> 53:51.128
But I'm in!

53:51.195 --> 53:52.863
I'm into ancient Egypt!

53:55.566 --> 53:58.369
Oh, wow! Look at that!
Paintings and everything!

54:00.170 --> 54:02.840
JAMES: I'm gonna go around
the unconvincing fighter jet.

54:05.410 --> 54:10.114
JEREMY: Understeering
like mad, that's not good.
I must remember that.

54:10.180 --> 54:12.683
The problem you have in
the 4C is it's mid-engined,

54:12.750 --> 54:14.785
which means,
on a surface like this,

54:14.852 --> 54:16.354
there's no weight
over the front,

54:16.421 --> 54:18.456
and that means...
no grip.

54:20.825 --> 54:23.694
RICHARD: Unlike the other two,
this is front-engined,

54:23.761 --> 54:25.563
so there's less weight
on the back end,

54:25.630 --> 54:27.498
which would make
for a livelier back end

54:27.565 --> 54:30.000
and more time
enjoying oversteer.

54:32.169 --> 54:34.339
Oh, I'm gonna spin!

54:35.673 --> 54:38.709
That's bad!
That's too much oversteer.

54:39.844 --> 54:41.346
JEREMY:
Game Of Thrones set.

54:41.412 --> 54:43.481
I mustn't think about
Khaleesi.

54:43.548 --> 54:46.484
Oh, no! Thinking about
Khaleesi, it's bad!

54:46.551 --> 54:48.586
Don't think about Khaleesi!

54:48.653 --> 54:50.355
No!

54:51.922 --> 54:54.024
Holy crap!

54:54.091 --> 54:55.426
It's a castle!

54:57.862 --> 55:00.598
God, no! Nearly hit
a bit of Nazareth then.

55:00.665 --> 55:02.767
Jesus
would have been displeased.

55:07.405 --> 55:08.639
JEREMY: Having got to know

55:08.706 --> 55:10.708
our weird
and demanding track,

55:10.775 --> 55:13.978
we began the timed laps,
with James going first

55:14.044 --> 55:17.582
in his lightweight,
powerful Norfolk-mobile.

55:19.417 --> 55:21.218
Right, are we ready,
James May?

55:21.285 --> 55:23.788
In three, two, one... Begin!

55:32.963 --> 55:35.966
Oh, where's the bend?
I don't...

55:39.103 --> 55:40.405
Oh, balls!

55:40.405 --> 55:42.272
You know,
what worries me most of all,

55:42.407 --> 55:47.612
is the poor little man
who's mortgaged his house
to start Zenos.

55:47.678 --> 55:49.680
And that he's lent it to us
on the television.

55:49.747 --> 55:52.216
"And which one's driving it?
Which...?"

55:52.282 --> 55:53.551
"Oh, no."

55:56.053 --> 55:57.488
Right, now what do I do?

56:01.125 --> 56:03.628
After my first-corner
cock-up,

56:03.694 --> 56:06.564
I was on the back foot,
trying to make up time.

56:09.967 --> 56:11.936
Heading for Nazareth,
I think.

56:17.174 --> 56:19.009
Whoa!

56:19.076 --> 56:20.611
All over the place!

56:27.518 --> 56:29.920
Round and round the thingy.

56:31.021 --> 56:32.490
Whoa!

56:38.028 --> 56:39.964
Fast, faster. Faster.

56:52.777 --> 56:58.248
Well...
this only goes up to
999 hours, sadly.

56:58.315 --> 56:59.550
JAMES: Right.

56:59.617 --> 57:01.919
But it's OK,
you were just in that time.

57:01.986 --> 57:02.753
Yeah, mm.

57:02.820 --> 57:04.221
James,
did you manage to drive

57:04.288 --> 57:06.624
whilst dragging your face
along the ground?

57:06.691 --> 57:08.292
A lot of dust comes in.

57:08.358 --> 57:11.161
-Why don't you wind
the windows up?

57:11.228 --> 57:13.230
You're funny men.

57:13.297 --> 57:17.001
RICHARD: Next, it was
the turn of John Travolta.

57:17.067 --> 57:20.605
Never has anybody
looked quite so good...

57:20.671 --> 57:22.072
...on a timed lap.

57:24.809 --> 57:28.012
In three, two, one... Go!

57:34.084 --> 57:35.886
Right,
let's make this count.

57:40.558 --> 57:42.527
Narrow!

57:52.069 --> 57:53.170
Sideways in linen!

58:07.952 --> 58:09.186
Game Of Thrones set.

58:18.162 --> 58:19.797
Understeering...

58:20.731 --> 58:22.600
Turn! Turn!

58:25.936 --> 58:28.606
Come on, let's get
that turbocharger singing!

58:30.207 --> 58:31.942
Kill it now!

58:48.659 --> 58:49.960
Well, he arrived.

58:51.328 --> 58:54.298
JAMES: Finally,
Sir John Blashford-Hammond.

58:55.666 --> 58:56.734
-Yes.

58:56.801 --> 58:59.069
In three, two, one... Go!

59:02.372 --> 59:03.774
Right, this is it.

59:22.526 --> 59:24.061
I can't afford
a single error.

59:40.477 --> 59:42.312
Uh-oh! This is a hot lap!

59:53.190 --> 59:55.492
Here he comes.

59:55.559 --> 59:57.662
Ooh!

1:00:00.297 --> 1:00:01.832
No!

1:00:01.899 --> 1:00:04.068
And with that,
back to the tent.

1:00:08.172 --> 1:00:10.407
Smashed it.
Smashed it.

1:00:10.474 --> 1:00:12.977
-Hang on a minute.

1:00:13.043 --> 1:00:16.380
You know that
Windmills Of Your Mind
sequence in the car?

1:00:16.446 --> 1:00:19.149
-Yeah.
-You made the Alfa
look really good in that.

1:00:19.216 --> 1:00:21.185
-Yes.

1:00:21.251 --> 1:00:22.820
You don't want that
on your conscience.

1:00:22.887 --> 1:00:25.155
What do you mean?
It was a brilliant... What?

1:00:25.222 --> 1:00:28.893
Anyway, anyway, I have
the results here of the laps.

1:00:28.959 --> 1:00:30.995
And er...
well, in third place,

1:00:31.061 --> 1:00:32.730
you in the Zenos;
second place,
you in the Alfa;

1:00:32.797 --> 1:00:34.899
first place, the winner
was me in the Mazda.

1:00:34.965 --> 1:00:36.366
But it was
a hollow victory,

1:00:36.433 --> 1:00:40.337
because I ruined an
ancient piece of sculpture.

1:00:41.638 --> 1:00:43.073
Yes,
but here's the thing, OK?

1:00:43.140 --> 1:00:46.376
After the weight test
and the speed test we did,

1:00:46.443 --> 1:00:49.079
we've learned...

1:00:49.146 --> 1:00:50.881
-...nothing.
-Yeah, it's nothing.
Nothing at all.

1:00:50.948 --> 1:00:52.950
Literally nothing at all.

1:00:53.017 --> 1:00:55.019
And on that
terrible disappointment,

1:00:55.085 --> 1:00:56.220
I'm afraid it's time to end.

1:00:56.286 --> 1:00:58.022
Thank you so much
for watching.

1:00:58.088 --> 1:01:00.290
-See you next week. Goodbye.
-Goodbye!
