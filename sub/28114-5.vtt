WEBVTT

00:00.582 --> 00:02.040
Really heavy.

00:02.041 --> 00:04.090
This was, like, a monsoon of a period.

00:04.091 --> 00:06.011
It lasted, like, over two weeks.

00:06.012 --> 00:10.143
Sometimes, our ovaries...
they just get lazy.

00:10.144 --> 00:14.013
Yeah, and I guess these are what
you would call hot flashes.

00:14.014 --> 00:16.808
I can't believe this is actually
finally happening to me.

00:16.809 --> 00:20.090
Also, plus, my ex-husband

00:20.091 --> 00:23.072
is repeatedly raping me every night.

00:24.176 --> 00:25.504
Excuse me?

00:25.505 --> 00:27.059
In my dreams.

00:27.060 --> 00:28.697
No, not dreams.

00:28.698 --> 00:30.699
They're nightmares, in my nightmares.

00:30.700 --> 00:34.865
U-Uh, I'm sorry, that,
uh... sounds awful.

00:34.866 --> 00:37.011
Do you think it's, like, hormones?

00:37.012 --> 00:38.406
You think this is it?

00:38.407 --> 00:40.338
I mean, this has got to
be it. This is it, right?

00:40.339 --> 00:42.204
Well, we'll take your blood today

00:42.205 --> 00:43.691
and again in six months.

00:43.692 --> 00:45.256
And if you don't get another period,

00:45.257 --> 00:47.281
then you will be in perimenopause.

00:47.282 --> 00:48.922
We'll also check your FSH levels.

00:48.923 --> 00:53.432
Below 20 is normal, above
30 is change of life.

00:53.433 --> 00:55.211
This is normal.

00:55.212 --> 00:56.938
You're degenerating.

00:56.939 --> 00:58.774
Oh. Thank you.

00:58.775 --> 01:00.973
You're coming into your gland finale.

01:00.974 --> 01:03.753
Like, the fireworks at the
end of the Fourth of July.

01:03.754 --> 01:06.244
Okay, yes. Yes!

01:06.245 --> 01:08.213
I can't wait to have a full beard.

01:08.214 --> 01:09.414
Or a soul patch.

01:09.415 --> 01:11.232
Okay, well.

01:11.233 --> 01:12.400
Uh, let's have a look.

01:12.401 --> 01:13.961
Please put your heels
up in the stirrups.

01:13.962 --> 01:16.221
Okay.

01:18.000 --> 01:24.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:29.236 --> 01:30.385
Okay.

01:30.386 --> 01:32.470
Uh, could you please, uh,
scoot down a little bit.

01:32.471 --> 01:34.776
- Little bit further, please?
- Okay.

01:37.970 --> 01:40.958
I'm-I'm sorry to ask,

01:40.959 --> 01:43.146
but are you gonna put on gloves?

01:43.147 --> 01:45.133
Oh, yes, I am.

01:45.134 --> 01:46.367
Um, I always do.

01:46.368 --> 01:47.435
See? Right here.

01:47.436 --> 01:50.220
- Okay, good.
- Got it.

01:50.221 --> 01:53.274
Sorry. I didn't mean to
question your professionalism.

01:53.275 --> 01:55.599
Does it, does it bother you
that I asked you that?

01:55.600 --> 01:57.126
Nah, we're all good, Sam.

01:57.127 --> 01:58.750
Okay, good.

01:59.677 --> 02:03.067
Because, if you think
about it, Dr. Chen,

02:03.068 --> 02:05.170
there's just one thin layer of latex

02:05.171 --> 02:08.271
that is the difference
between you examining me

02:08.273 --> 02:10.191
and you fingering me.

02:10.192 --> 02:11.707
You know what I'm saying?

02:13.147 --> 02:15.511
Let's just try to relax.

02:15.512 --> 02:17.067
Yeah.

02:17.068 --> 02:18.834
Uh, wiggle your toes, please.

02:18.835 --> 02:20.067
Why?

02:20.068 --> 02:22.875
It, uh, it helps to
open you up down there.

Sorry to interrupt, but I...

02:53.876 --> 02:55.937
Can you talk a little bit louder?

02:55.938 --> 02:58.643
- I can't hear you.
- Mom. Stop.

02:58.644 --> 03:00.959
He's telling us important safety things.

03:00.960 --> 03:03.812
We're about to operate

- We need to hear this.
- It's not important, Sam.

It's safety B.S. and legal disclaimers

03:07.650 --> 03:09.093
that would never hold up in court.

03:09.094 --> 03:11.395
Mom? Mom.

03:11.396 --> 03:13.549
Can I have more quarters for air hockey?

03:13.550 --> 03:16.145
I gave you ten dollars.
You already spent it?

03:16.146 --> 03:18.556
Uh-huh, on the claw machine.
Can we have more?

03:18.557 --> 03:20.762
- And we want to play air hockey.
- Where's Pepper?

03:20.763 --> 03:22.504
She's over there playing
at the pool table.

03:26.751 --> 03:28.317
Okay.

03:29.606 --> 03:31.005
- Okay?
- Bye.

03:31.006 --> 03:32.940
I love you. T.Y. T.Y. T.Y.

03:32.941 --> 03:35.301
Okay, you're welcome. Y.W.

03:35.302 --> 03:36.944
Please, continue.

03:36.945 --> 03:38.963
So.

03:38.964 --> 03:41.632
Keep a three-yard distance

03:41.633 --> 03:43.634
- on the way, so if you get be...
- Buddy.

03:43.635 --> 03:46.420
Bro, not to be an asshole,

03:46.421 --> 03:49.022
but I still can't hear you. Not at all.

03:50.110 --> 03:52.740
Listen, I know this probably
isn't your dream job,

03:52.741 --> 03:54.996
but what you do here is important.

03:54.997 --> 03:57.689
You provide a very important service,

03:57.690 --> 03:59.830
so we need to hear you.

03:59.831 --> 04:00.844
Okay, yeah, sure.

04:00.845 --> 04:02.547
Mom, do you want to ride
the go-karts, or not?

04:02.548 --> 04:04.187
No, I really don't.

04:04.188 --> 04:06.444
But I'm trying to give
you guys a fun childhood

04:06.445 --> 04:10.028
and at the same time, to
not die or get paralyzed.

04:10.029 --> 04:12.620
All right, Mom,

04:12.621 --> 04:13.965
stop being so dramatic.

04:13.966 --> 04:17.969
And you, sir, are the only
thing that sits between

04:17.970 --> 04:20.772
my family and a horrible tragedy.

04:20.773 --> 04:23.975
So please make your
instructions clearer.

04:23.976 --> 04:25.793
Sing out, Louise.

04:25.794 --> 04:27.424
- Um, Ollivier.
- Oh.

04:27.425 --> 04:29.290
- My name's Ollivier.
- Oh, he's Ollivier.

04:29.291 --> 04:30.698
- Oh.
- Ollivier.

04:30.699 --> 04:31.950
- Oh.
- So funny, man.

04:31.951 --> 04:34.702
- I'm Ollivier, as well.
- That's crazy, man.

04:34.703 --> 04:36.003
Nice to meet you, Ollivier.

04:36.004 --> 04:37.521
Right back at you, man.

04:37.522 --> 04:40.210
Give us your instructions,
Go-Kart Ollivier.

04:48.993 --> 04:50.702
There we have our first two pedals.

04:50.703 --> 04:51.853
The green pedal is for acceleration,

04:51.854 --> 04:54.292
and the red pedal is for the brakes.

05:07.803 --> 05:10.307
You got the wrong one.

05:10.308 --> 05:14.127
Hey! Fun mom!

05:20.766 --> 05:22.391
Yes.

05:22.392 --> 05:25.648
I'm a wheelman from way back.

05:25.649 --> 05:26.938
Yes, I am.

05:29.658 --> 05:31.742
Fun, right?

05:31.743 --> 05:33.744
Hey, Mom, hot behind.

05:34.930 --> 05:35.997
I love you, Mom!

05:35.998 --> 05:37.666
Me, more!

05:47.876 --> 05:50.044
- Shotgun.
- Duke, don't.

05:50.045 --> 05:51.629
Don't try.

05:51.630 --> 05:52.730
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

05:52.731 --> 05:54.916
- Getting in the car.
- Hey, no. No. Hey.

05:54.917 --> 05:57.769
- Duke. Duke. No, get out.
- What? What?

05:57.770 --> 06:00.484
- Hey! Stop. Are you kidding me?
- Out. Out.

06:00.485 --> 06:02.182
Are you coming home for dinner?

06:02.183 --> 06:03.471
Uh, I don't know.

06:03.472 --> 06:05.344
Why? This is unfair.

06:05.345 --> 06:07.374
- Those are so sweet.
- No, it's not unfair.

06:07.375 --> 06:08.484
- Will you send me those?
- Mm-hmm.

06:08.485 --> 06:10.602
You've been getting it all this time.

06:10.603 --> 06:14.168
Stop, stop! You got all
last week, you got it.

06:14.169 --> 06:16.312
- I will always get it, I'm older.
- Guys.

06:16.313 --> 06:18.231
Listen, technically, you're too small

06:18.232 --> 06:19.641
to legally sit in the front seat.

06:19.642 --> 06:21.518
- Shut up!
- Enough.

06:21.519 --> 06:23.856
- Mom could get arrested, you know.
- You're so rude!

06:23.857 --> 06:26.029
Hey! That's enough.

06:26.030 --> 06:28.158
Be quiet. Stop it.

06:29.395 --> 06:31.327
- Hey!
- Selfish!

06:31.328 --> 06:33.596
- I'm done.
- Super dramatic, Mom.

06:33.597 --> 06:35.331
So mean.

06:35.332 --> 06:36.368
Oh.

06:40.538 --> 06:42.416
Okay, I tell you what.

06:43.224 --> 06:45.157
You have one minute.

06:45.158 --> 06:47.789
You can say anything you
want to each other.

06:47.790 --> 06:49.832
Anything. You get it all out.

06:49.833 --> 06:52.460
Say the worst things
that pop into your head.

06:52.461 --> 06:53.499
Anything.

06:53.500 --> 06:55.318
And then it's over.

06:55.319 --> 06:56.703
Okay?

06:56.704 --> 06:59.339
- Anything?
- Anything.

06:59.340 --> 07:02.701
For real, Mom? Like, bad words?

07:02.702 --> 07:04.221
Really bad words?

07:04.222 --> 07:05.960
Yep, no limit.

07:05.961 --> 07:07.600
Cursing? We can curse?

07:07.601 --> 07:09.674
Yes, go for it.

07:09.675 --> 07:11.686
But then it's over. Okay?

07:11.687 --> 07:12.886
Let me see you fight.

07:12.887 --> 07:15.238
You can really get it all out.

07:15.239 --> 07:17.831
Just say all the bad
things to each other.

07:18.718 --> 07:20.226
One minute.

07:20.227 --> 07:21.412
And, go.

07:21.413 --> 07:23.555
- Bitch, fucking asshole.
- Little baby.

07:23.556 --> 07:25.446
- Mommy's little perfect angel.
- Selfish, fishpussy psycho.

07:25.447 --> 07:26.668
- Manipulative.
- Dick breath.

07:26.669 --> 07:28.494
- Get everything you want.
- Shit licker.

07:28.495 --> 07:30.198
- Manipulative, spoiled...
- Psycho.

07:30.199 --> 07:32.819
Cock, douche sack, fuckface!

07:38.167 --> 07:39.364
What just happened?

07:40.466 --> 07:42.300
- I'm dizzy.
- Jew.

07:43.652 --> 07:45.536
Your mouth!

07:45.537 --> 07:46.705
Oh, my God!

07:46.706 --> 07:48.540
- Duke!
- No!

07:48.541 --> 07:51.426
Did she just say that?

07:51.427 --> 07:54.412
I'll wash out your mouth with soap.

07:54.413 --> 07:55.747
That's it.

07:57.176 --> 08:00.552
No, Pepper, close your ears.

08:00.553 --> 08:03.354
That's the worst thing.

08:03.355 --> 08:06.441
Oh, my God. Wash your
mouth out with soap.

08:06.442 --> 08:09.528
Oh, my God, I'm done.

08:12.632 --> 08:15.434
I didn't know you knew those words!

08:29.812 --> 08:32.166
Happy birthday.

08:32.167 --> 08:35.524
- What can this be?
- It's called The Womanizer.

08:35.525 --> 08:39.256
It, um, well, it sucks on your clit.

08:39.258 --> 08:42.210
- Oy.
- Sam, Sam.

08:42.211 --> 08:45.046
- It's for your clit.
- I don't like it.

08:45.047 --> 08:49.050
They did a study. Half of all
women orgasm within 60 seconds.

08:49.051 --> 08:51.102
- What? 60 seconds?
- 60 seconds.

08:51.103 --> 08:53.371
Excuse me.

08:53.372 --> 08:55.073
I'm sorry it doesn't come attached

08:55.074 --> 08:57.291
to an actual living,
breathing man, but...

08:57.292 --> 08:59.655
they seem to be all off with
25-year-olds these days.

08:59.656 --> 09:02.481
Oh, yeah. That's because
we've aged out of our men,

09:02.482 --> 09:05.083
like kids age out of the
foster care system.

09:05.084 --> 09:07.034
Facts on facts on facts on facts.

09:07.035 --> 09:09.003
That's it.

09:09.004 --> 09:12.190
- Thank you.
- Double fist.

09:14.226 --> 09:16.194
Ooh. Ooh. What?

09:16.195 --> 09:18.938
I don't, I don't see a
ring. I don't have a ring.

09:18.939 --> 09:20.949
- Who doesn't, even?
- My husband is just boring.

09:20.950 --> 09:23.134
He wasn't always boring. He's boring.

09:23.135 --> 09:25.036
And he talks and all I hear is...

09:27.139 --> 09:28.222
White noise.

09:28.223 --> 09:30.842
You're so lucky you got out, Sam.

09:30.843 --> 09:34.929
I am next, goddamm it. I'm next!

09:34.930 --> 09:37.865
Hello, ladies. Uh, so,
tonight's special...

09:37.866 --> 09:40.902
Oh, honey, hi, listen, no
offense, but could we have him?

09:40.903 --> 09:43.304
'Cause we never get to look
at anything nice like that.

09:43.305 --> 09:45.890
Come on, you get to
fuck him, we just want

09:45.891 --> 09:49.010
- to play with him a little.
- Seems fair.

09:49.011 --> 09:51.062
<i>Buonasera, grazie.</i>

09:51.063 --> 09:53.865
Don't give me that look. Did
you see that look she...

09:53.866 --> 09:55.311
I'll kill you, I'll kill you.

09:56.573 --> 09:58.821
Tonight I'm gonna do rails,
I'm gonna fuck that waiter,

09:58.822 --> 10:00.304
and I'm gonna leave my husband.

10:00.305 --> 10:03.174
It's all happening
tonight, all happening.

10:03.175 --> 10:05.093
Thank you.

10:05.094 --> 10:06.961
<i>Buonasera, signorine.</i>

10:06.962 --> 10:08.062
<i>Buonasera.</i>

10:08.063 --> 10:09.180
<i>Buonasera.</i>

10:09.181 --> 10:11.099
<i>Da che parte dell'Italia vien?</i>

10:11.100 --> 10:13.000
- Naples.
- Oh.

10:13.001 --> 10:15.002
<i>Come hai imparato a parlare
cosi bene italiana?</i>

10:15.003 --> 10:17.798
Well, I spent summers in Avellino.

10:17.799 --> 10:21.075
<i>Hai visitato il Santuario
di Montevergine?</i>

10:21.076 --> 10:22.386
Of course.

10:22.387 --> 10:24.061
I spent my 40th birthday in Avellino.

10:24.062 --> 10:25.242
You are not 40.

10:25.243 --> 10:28.232
- Um, yeah, I am 40.
- Not possible.

10:28.233 --> 10:30.018
Shut up.

10:30.019 --> 10:31.828
Yes, look.

10:31.829 --> 10:35.161
I got this necklace

10:35.162 --> 10:37.108
on my 40th birthday.

10:37.109 --> 10:40.845
It's made from a
230-year-old Italian coin.

10:40.846 --> 10:43.297
So pretty. Marcello, you
have them all to yourself.

10:43.298 --> 10:45.116
This isn't fair.

10:45.117 --> 10:48.103
You have to share.

10:48.104 --> 10:49.387
I'll share.

10:49.388 --> 10:51.323
Oh, my God.

10:51.324 --> 10:54.292
When they do that, it makes me
feel like we're in wheelchairs

10:54.293 --> 10:56.338
lined up outside the nursing home.

10:56.339 --> 10:58.029
Just put a thin blanket over my legs

10:58.030 --> 11:00.705
- and point me towards the sun.
- Ugh.

11:00.706 --> 11:03.675
- When did we start being that?
- About ten years ago.

11:03.676 --> 11:06.600
Yeah, and about 20 years ago,
I would've believed them.

11:06.601 --> 11:09.224
And then they would've tried
to take us to a club after

11:09.225 --> 11:11.843
and most of us would've gotten laid.

11:11.844 --> 11:13.895
Oh, me the most. Me the most laid.

11:16.547 --> 11:17.866
We're irrelevant.

11:17.867 --> 11:19.234
- We're obsolete.
- We're disgusting.

11:19.235 --> 11:20.712
Absolutely disgusting.

11:20.713 --> 11:23.558
I have a belly and a
beard and my period.

11:23.559 --> 11:25.723
My stomach's trying to fuck my pussy.

11:29.589 --> 11:32.486
You realize this is as good as
we're ever gonna look, right?

11:32.487 --> 11:34.406
It's just gonna go downhill from here.

11:34.407 --> 11:35.951
I know. 100%.

11:35.952 --> 11:38.203
Can't wait, though.

11:38.204 --> 11:40.104
Yeah.

11:44.361 --> 11:47.962
This is... a goal of life.

11:47.963 --> 11:50.048
This was part of my flow chart.

11:57.039 --> 11:59.958
Do you and Danny still
do it every day?

12:02.589 --> 12:05.554
Well, in a word... yes.

12:06.575 --> 12:07.898
Sometimes more than once.

12:07.899 --> 12:11.428
But do you guys pretend to-to,
like, be other people,

12:11.429 --> 12:13.071
other people came over
to the house, like,

12:13.072 --> 12:15.734
"Oh, hello. Nice to meet you."

12:17.893 --> 12:21.142
They were $379, it's real gold.

12:21.143 --> 12:22.601
I love you.

12:22.602 --> 12:25.952
All right, who wants to go
to the bathroom? Anybody?

12:25.953 --> 12:27.564
Exactly.

12:27.565 --> 12:29.098
Don't you want to go to the bathroom?

12:29.099 --> 12:30.977
- No, I'm with Lala.
- You don't want to go...

12:30.978 --> 12:33.124
No, I don't want to.

12:35.261 --> 12:36.861
- Whoa!
- Hi.

12:36.862 --> 12:39.213
I'm so sorry I'm late. I can't
believe I even made it.

12:39.214 --> 12:42.333
It's good to see you. I'm
glad you made it, too.

12:42.334 --> 12:44.902
- I can't believe we're here.
- How's Randy?

12:44.903 --> 12:48.671
Oh, he's okay, but his dad is dying.

12:48.672 --> 12:50.257
- Oh...
- Yes.

12:50.258 --> 12:52.126
Shitshow as usual.

12:52.127 --> 12:55.314
I'm taking care of the
boys alone and his mama.

12:55.315 --> 12:57.534
Meanwhile, I'm supposed
to get back to Thailand

12:57.535 --> 12:59.117
to finish the film.

12:59.810 --> 13:01.302
Where in the hell is everybody else?

13:01.303 --> 13:02.735
- Bathroom.
- Yeah.

13:02.736 --> 13:04.787
- Already?
- Mm-hmm.

13:04.788 --> 13:07.892
Oh, yes. Mama blow.

13:07.893 --> 13:11.975
At last. Ladies, I gots to go.

13:16.835 --> 13:17.869
I see you.

13:19.139 --> 13:22.056
What's that for, huh?

13:37.207 --> 13:40.737
- How's Tom?
- He's good.

13:41.766 --> 13:44.228
- And the twins?
- I like one of them.

13:44.229 --> 13:49.000
Hmm. I like one of mine,
too. I'm not naming names.

13:49.001 --> 13:51.969
Why did we put ourselves
through all this?

13:51.970 --> 13:55.056
It's insane. Nobody told me
it was gonna be this hard.

13:55.057 --> 13:58.260
I suffered through four
years of IVF for this shit.

13:59.150 --> 14:00.739
I could've spent the money on a house.

14:00.740 --> 14:01.913
A big house.

14:01.914 --> 14:05.501
Yeah. But it's just so rewarding...

14:05.502 --> 14:10.238
Yeah, right. Not when
Tionna's screaming "no" at me

14:10.239 --> 14:13.090
and telling me, "You're the
meanest mom in the whole world,"

14:13.091 --> 14:14.664
and nobody loves her.

14:14.665 --> 14:15.993
Mm.

14:15.994 --> 14:19.230
And Tom's passed out in the living room,

14:19.231 --> 14:21.332
and Essex just wants his attention,

14:21.333 --> 14:23.835
and I work the longest hours.

14:26.466 --> 14:28.989
- You said mama blow?
- Oh, listen, I know what I'm doing.

14:28.990 --> 14:32.160
- Oh, I need a chair.
- Oh.

14:32.161 --> 14:33.928
We need a chair.

14:46.191 --> 14:48.993
I haven't had any surgery at all.

14:48.994 --> 14:50.194
What? What are you looking at?

14:50.195 --> 14:52.330
Just a little, little injection.

14:58.071 --> 15:00.237
- Oh!
- That's a Sicilian curse.

15:00.238 --> 15:02.476
She put the mark on you.

15:02.477 --> 15:06.347
She got the eye, the evil
eye! Call it the fury.

15:27.133 --> 15:29.067
Sam, Sam, Sam, Sam, Sam...

15:36.927 --> 15:38.226
Mm-mm.

15:58.164 --> 15:59.930
Come on. You got to plank.

15:59.931 --> 16:02.534
- Like RBG.
- Oof.

16:02.535 --> 16:05.836
I don't know if I can
do this today, Ida.

16:05.837 --> 16:09.707
What? It's the best thing
for your hangover.

16:09.708 --> 16:11.991
You'll feel better, honey, I promise.

16:11.992 --> 16:13.911
Oh.

16:13.912 --> 16:16.764
Oh, my.

16:16.765 --> 16:19.033
The undercarriage smells.

16:19.034 --> 16:20.234
What?

16:20.235 --> 16:23.171
Ramen. The ramen noodle.

16:23.172 --> 16:26.356
- Ew... oh, my God.
- I'm serious.

16:26.357 --> 16:28.959
Oof. Is that me?

16:28.960 --> 16:30.498
Or is that you?

16:30.499 --> 16:33.814
Honey, I'm chicken broth,

16:33.815 --> 16:35.867
but it smells like you've
got a whole can of tuna

16:35.868 --> 16:37.151
shoved up there.

16:37.152 --> 16:39.871
It's pretty strong, bro.

16:41.093 --> 16:43.091
This is embarrassing.

16:43.092 --> 16:45.125
Well, it's not a hygiene thing.

16:45.126 --> 16:48.675
It's the fish oil I'm
taking, for fertility.

16:48.676 --> 16:50.861
Fish oil for fertility?

16:50.862 --> 16:53.573
Last night you were making
plans to leave your husband.

16:54.427 --> 16:57.517
That was... Look, I had too much wine.

16:57.518 --> 16:59.336
Your hand was up the waiter's shirt.

17:02.286 --> 17:04.061
It most certainly was not.

17:06.426 --> 17:07.987
I'm sorry.

17:08.694 --> 17:10.034
Your smell.

17:11.204 --> 17:12.863
I'm gonna be sick.

17:20.343 --> 17:22.179
Jesus, Mom.

17:22.180 --> 17:24.188
Are you pregnant? Is that,
is that even possible?

17:24.189 --> 17:26.207
Get out. Get out.

17:26.208 --> 17:28.403
Did you drink too much last night?

17:28.404 --> 17:31.062
I had two glasses of wine.

17:31.063 --> 17:33.349
Bullshit, you always have
more than two glasses.

17:33.350 --> 17:36.616
That's just something moms say,
"I only had two glasses,"

17:36.617 --> 17:38.153
when they really had more like four,

17:38.154 --> 17:40.289
but they don't want their kids
to think they're driving drunk.

17:40.290 --> 17:42.991
- Get out of the room right now.
- I mean, you hit your head

17:42.992 --> 17:44.226
pretty hard the other day.

17:44.227 --> 17:46.194
I mean, the-the-the contact,

17:46.195 --> 17:49.014
the way your head snapped forward.

17:49.015 --> 17:50.853
I'm pretty sure you have whiplash.

17:50.854 --> 17:52.286
Or maybe you're pregnant.

17:52.287 --> 17:54.352
Am I gonna have a baby brother, Sam?

17:54.353 --> 17:57.259
Anyway,

17:57.260 --> 18:00.192
you're sick from the whiplash.
I looked it up on WebMD.

18:00.193 --> 18:03.362
Symptoms include nausea,
headaches and dizziness.

18:05.283 --> 18:08.033
What do you say when you
get good medical advice?

18:10.570 --> 18:11.797
You're welcome.

18:21.585 --> 18:22.914
Sam?

18:22.915 --> 18:26.918
Sam... girls? I'm so
stupid, I've lost my key.

18:26.919 --> 18:29.988
Sam? Hello? Someone?

18:29.989 --> 18:31.924
I've lo... oh, it doesn't matter.

18:38.065 --> 18:40.082
Okay.

18:43.988 --> 18:47.994
Did you have a very salty
fucking meal last night?

18:47.995 --> 18:49.391
Excuse me?

18:49.392 --> 18:52.068
A salty fucking meal.

18:52.069 --> 18:53.445
Did you have one last night?

18:53.446 --> 18:55.390
Um, no. Why?

18:55.391 --> 18:58.790
Well, your blood pressure is
through the roof. 168/110.

18:58.791 --> 18:59.795
Oh.

18:59.796 --> 19:01.987
I don't want to put you
on BP meds just yet,

19:01.988 --> 19:03.509
so, you know, we'll
just keep an eye on it.

19:03.510 --> 19:05.124
- Okay.
- Your intake form here

19:05.125 --> 19:08.139
says that you hurt yourself go-karting?

19:08.140 --> 19:09.961
What the fuck were you doing that for?

19:09.962 --> 19:11.515
I took my kids.

19:12.433 --> 19:13.982
Come on.

19:13.983 --> 19:15.284
Move your hair.

19:17.105 --> 19:19.604
- Does that hurt?
- Nah, it's just tender.

19:19.605 --> 19:23.183
Relax. Relax.

19:24.011 --> 19:26.228
- Relax, come on.
- Okay.

19:26.229 --> 19:29.180
Okay. I think you have a muscle strain.

19:29.181 --> 19:31.933
The soreness will go away in
a few days, but, you know,

19:31.934 --> 19:34.953
go and see a fucking chiropractor
if it keeps bothering you.

19:34.954 --> 19:37.731
Now, what about this, uh, insomnia

19:37.732 --> 19:39.057
that you wrote down over here?

19:39.058 --> 19:42.394
I can't sleep. And when I
finally do get to sleep,

19:42.395 --> 19:44.212
I have nightmares that my ex-husband

19:44.213 --> 19:46.181
is repeatedly raping me.

19:46.182 --> 19:47.376
What the fuck?

19:48.151 --> 19:50.152
Have you been under a
lot of stress lately?

19:50.153 --> 19:52.053
I guess so. I don't know.

19:52.054 --> 19:54.873
Okay. Well, you need to
let some of that shit go.

19:54.874 --> 19:56.959
Otherwise, it's gonna
fucking kill you. Okay?

19:56.960 --> 19:58.606
All of it. Just let it go.

19:58.607 --> 20:01.263
You know, your hang-ups, your
fucking beefs, your past,

20:01.264 --> 20:04.016
your future, all of those
fucking worries, all right?

20:04.017 --> 20:05.350
All of it. Listen to me.

20:05.351 --> 20:08.987
Listen. Let it go.

20:08.988 --> 20:11.356
This advice is gonna put
years back on your life.

20:11.357 --> 20:14.426
Okay, Dr. Babu, but I think
it's a little more complicated

20:14.427 --> 20:16.995
- than just letting it go.
- No, it fucking isn't.

20:16.996 --> 20:19.064
Look, if you come to me
complaining of a burning hand

20:19.065 --> 20:20.315
and you're holding a hot fucking iron,

20:20.316 --> 20:22.050
well, guess what I'm gonna say?

20:22.051 --> 20:24.136
"Let it fucking go"?

20:24.137 --> 20:26.004
Now you understand.

20:26.005 --> 20:28.056
Well, there's a lot of it to let go of.

20:28.057 --> 20:30.142
So what? Let it go.

20:30.143 --> 20:32.144
First off, I took my daughter to college

20:32.145 --> 20:34.946
and she dropped out and
moved back into the house.

20:34.947 --> 20:37.232
- Fuck her.
- And then there's, uh,

20:37.233 --> 20:40.776
a mountain of mom shit that I
have to get through every day.

20:40.777 --> 20:42.221
What, errands? Who doesn't, huh?

20:42.222 --> 20:44.122
- Let it go.
- No.

20:44.123 --> 20:47.192
No, errands are, like, groceries
and going to the post office.

20:47.193 --> 20:49.294
- Mm-hmm. Yeah.
- The real mom stuff.

20:49.295 --> 20:52.381
Soccer club sign-ups and dance classes

20:52.382 --> 20:56.201
and tutors and tuition payments
and parent-teacher conferences

20:56.202 --> 20:59.271
and schools and camps that
I have to get them into,

20:59.272 --> 21:02.391
and, and mean girl issues
with my youngest at school

21:02.392 --> 21:05.360
and birth control with my oldest and...

21:05.361 --> 21:08.296
cruelty from my middle daughter!

21:08.297 --> 21:10.365
And then there's my own mom,

21:10.366 --> 21:13.969
who is driving me nuts,
and I'm pretty sure

21:13.970 --> 21:16.050
she has a mental something disorder

21:16.051 --> 21:19.399
and my middle daughter
is hitting puberty hard.

21:19.400 --> 21:22.706
- Mm-hmm.
- And I...

21:22.707 --> 21:25.097
am definitely going through menopause,

21:25.098 --> 21:28.984
yet I still get my period and I
have a beard and two mortgages,

21:28.985 --> 21:31.953
so, yeah, Dr. Babu, it's like,

21:31.954 --> 21:35.257
it's a lot, and some mornings, I just...

21:35.258 --> 21:37.792
- Oh, my God.
- ...you know, lay in bed,

21:37.793 --> 21:40.059
in my room, and I stare at the ceiling

21:40.060 --> 21:44.859
and I just say I just can't
do it anymore. I just can't.

21:44.860 --> 21:48.604
I just can't, I just
can't, I can't, I can't.

21:51.729 --> 21:55.795
So, anyway, could you please
just give me some Xanax

21:55.796 --> 21:58.953
or Ativans or Ambiens or something?

21:59.639 --> 22:02.117
Anything you think that'll help
me get a full night's sleep,

22:02.118 --> 22:06.319
because that's what I
really need, Birju.

22:06.320 --> 22:08.023
I need a full night of sleep.

22:11.144 --> 22:13.996
You're fucked up. All right?

22:13.997 --> 22:16.147
You need to start taking
care of your brain.

22:16.148 --> 22:18.016
You know, shit like
this is caused by gunic

22:18.017 --> 22:20.927
and doshic imbalances, which
lead to a clouding of, uh,

22:20.928 --> 22:23.922
perception and a loss of
understanding. All right?

22:23.923 --> 22:25.924
Okay.

22:28.985 --> 22:31.544
I want you to see that guy.
He's a psychotherapist.

22:31.545 --> 22:33.503
Hey. Look, listen.

22:33.504 --> 22:36.185
At least four sessions with him, okay?

22:36.186 --> 22:40.189
And then I'll write you a
script for sleeping meds.

22:40.190 --> 22:43.291
- Deal?
- Fine.

22:43.292 --> 22:46.768
Oh, and also, do you
want to get an HPV shot?

22:46.769 --> 22:48.330
There are hundreds of strains of HPV.

22:48.331 --> 22:50.248
We have a vaccine against nine of them.

22:50.249 --> 22:52.296
I'm sure you have all nine.

22:53.430 --> 22:54.656
Uh...

22:54.657 --> 22:56.438
- Yeah.
- Okay.

22:56.439 --> 22:58.223
Good. Great.

22:58.224 --> 23:01.192
Feel better, and try to
have a good fucking day.

23:01.193 --> 23:03.111
- Okay.
- All right, I'll talk to you later.

23:03.112 --> 23:04.363
You fucking, too.

23:04.364 --> 23:05.524
Yeah.

23:05.525 --> 23:11.420
