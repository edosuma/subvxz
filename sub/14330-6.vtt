19:04.893 --> 19:07.062
- I'LL SAVE YOU!

19:07.145 --> 19:08.397
HA-HA!

19:08.480 --> 19:10.899
WOW, YOU CAN SEE THE WHOLE
PARKING LOT FROM HERE.

19:15.237 --> 19:16.488

IT APPEARS THE DAM I DIDN'T KNOW
WE HAD HAS BURST!

19:19.825 --> 19:22.202
MORE BAD NEWS!

19:22.286 --> 19:23.871

HAS ERUPTED!

19:24.746 --> 19:26.748
THIS JUST IN!

19:26.832 --> 19:28.417
THE CAT RESCUED
BY SUPER NOT COSMO

19:28.500 --> 19:30.627
WAS, IN FACT,
THE RARE DIMMSDALE TREE CAT!

19:30.711 --> 19:32.129
WHEN REMOVED FROM ITS TREE,

19:32.212 --> 19:34.214
IT ATTACKS ANYTHING
THAT'S RUNNING AND SCREAMING!

19:34.298 --> 19:38.135
[cat meowing wildly]

19:38.218 --> 19:39.344

19:42.764 --> 19:44.725
EVERYTHING HE'S DONE
HAS BACKFIRED!

19:44.808 --> 19:46.101
IN THIS REPORTER'S OPINION,

19:46.184 --> 19:49.438
SUPER NOT COSMO SHOULD SIT
IN THE CORNER!

19:49.521 --> 19:49.980
- SIT IN THE CORNER!

19:50.063 --> 19:52.608

19:57.404 --> 19:58.822

19:58.906 --> 20:00.490
THERE'S YOUR CAR, SALLY.

20:00.574 --> 20:01.450
- AHH!

20:06.914 --> 20:07.539
- WOW.

20:07.623 --> 20:09.291
THIS IS BAD EVEN FOR COSMO.

20:09.374 --> 20:11.418
- I WISH THE TOWN WAS BACK
TO NORMAL.

20:16.006 --> 20:17.382
[cat meows]

20:24.723 --> 20:27.434
- "DEAR FAMILY,
I'M GOING AWAY FOREVER,

20:27.517 --> 20:28.644
OR THREE WEEKS,

20:28.727 --> 20:29.853
WHICHEVER COMES FIRST."

20:29.937 --> 20:31.104
- POOF, POOF.

20:31.188 --> 20:32.105
- DON'T WORRY, POOF!

20:32.189 --> 20:33.315

20:33.398 --> 20:35.150

20:35.233 --> 20:36.443
TALLY HO!

20:36.526 --> 20:36.568
DAH!

20:41.240 --> 20:43.075
- LET'S FACE IT, WOLFIE;

20:43.158 --> 20:45.035
THIS TOWN DOESN'T NEED
A SUPERHERO.

20:45.118 --> 20:46.954
IT'S THE SAFEST PLACE ON EARTH.

20:47.037 --> 20:48.163
[explosion]

20:48.246 --> 20:51.083
- OH, WE'VE SEARCHED
THE WHOLE TOWN,

20:51.166 --> 20:52.876
AND THERE'S
STILL NO SIGN OF COSMO.

20:52.960 --> 20:54.419
WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?

20:54.503 --> 20:56.380
- WELL, COSMO FELT NEEDED
AS A SUPERHERO.

20:56.463 --> 20:58.632
SO WE NEED TO MAKE HIM
FEEL NEEDED AGAIN.

20:58.715 --> 20:59.841
I KNOW!

20:59.925 --> 21:02.010
WE'LL CREATE A SUPERVILLAIN!

21:28.036 --> 21:29.204
WHAT KIND OF SUPER VILLAIN

21:31.873 --> 21:34.042
WHICH MAKES HIM PERFECT
FOR COSMO!

21:37.129 --> 21:38.964

21:41.550 --> 21:45.178
