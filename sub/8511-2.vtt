00:10.928 --> 00:15.797
Fran: Amazing grace

00:17.351 --> 00:22.141
how sweet the sound

00:23.607 --> 00:25.723
that saved

00:33.867 --> 00:38.611
I once was lost

00:40.123 --> 00:43.991
but now I'm found

00:45.504 --> 00:47.836
was blind

00:48.423 --> 00:53.963
but how I see

01:11.989 --> 01:14.150
I love you, daddy.

01:17.119 --> 01:19.235
Frannie loves you.

01:58.035 --> 01:59.150
Fran?

01:59.328 --> 02:03.571
Mr. goldsmith? Hello?

02:03.749 --> 02:05.364
Fran: I'm here, Harold.

02:05.584 --> 02:07.415
Come in.

02:11.757 --> 02:13.213
Here

02:17.888 --> 02:19.628
careful

02:20.098 --> 02:22.089
it's my father.

02:22.976 --> 02:25.592
I'm gonna bury him in his garden.

02:25.979 --> 02:28.937
That's his favorite place.
I think he'll be able to rest there

02:29.107 --> 02:31.018
I really do.

02:31.193 --> 02:33.104
But I'm so hot and tired.

02:33.278 --> 02:35.485
Could you please help me?

02:36.573 --> 02:38.655
Of course.

03:16.196 --> 03:20.155
Here you go.
It's a little warm but it's not too bad.

03:21.284 --> 03:23.821
That's okay. I like warm lemonade.

03:27.374 --> 03:29.456
Fran: Harold, it's so strange.

03:29.626 --> 03:32.618
It doesn't even seem like
the place I grew up in.

03:32.796 --> 03:35.128
It seems like a different planet.

03:35.716 --> 03:38.253
Yeah, I know what you mean.

03:39.594 --> 03:41.710
I've always hated it here.

03:41.847 --> 03:44.759
All I ever wanted was to escape.

03:46.059 --> 03:49.802
All those guys who used
to give me wedgies in gym class,

03:50.021 --> 03:52.933
all the girls who used to laugh
at the way I walked,

03:53.108 --> 03:55.269
they're all gone.

03:57.070 --> 03:59.026
And I want them back.

04:00.532 --> 04:02.022
Nuts

04:09.416 --> 04:10.952
For two people

04:11.793 --> 04:15.911
from the same town,
two people who know each other,

04:16.047 --> 04:17.332
to both be immune

04:17.549 --> 04:19.540
to something this big,

04:19.718 --> 04:21.709
it's like winning
the megabucks lottery.

04:24.347 --> 04:26.087
It has to mean something.

04:26.308 --> 04:27.923
Well, there's gotta be other people.

04:28.101 --> 04:30.638
And we just gotta figure out
how to find them, don't you think?

04:33.690 --> 04:35.555
We have to go to stovington.

04:35.734 --> 04:37.270
Fran: Where?

04:37.444 --> 04:39.355
Stovington, Vermont.

04:39.488 --> 04:41.695
There's a government
communicable disease center there.

04:42.240 --> 04:45.323
If anyone's still alive
and trying to find a cure for the flu,

04:45.494 --> 04:46.734
that's where they'd be.

04:46.912 --> 04:48.277
Immune cases as well

04:48.413 --> 04:50.825
Harold, you're a genius.

04:51.041 --> 04:53.703
That's a great idea.

04:53.877 --> 04:56.619
Of course,
stovington might be deserted too.

04:59.758 --> 05:01.874
Roads are jammed.

05:02.761 --> 05:04.376
Can you ride a motorcycle?

05:04.554 --> 05:06.966
Yeah. Jess taught me.

05:08.141 --> 05:11.178
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, that's your boyfriend.

05:11.394 --> 05:13.601
Well, not anymore.

05:15.857 --> 05:17.768
Do you think that maybe...”

05:19.110 --> 05:20.520
You know, maybe I could be...

05:20.695 --> 05:24.233
Harold,
we're always gonna be friends.

05:25.158 --> 05:27.570
Oh, I forgot. “What?

05:27.786 --> 05:30.698
It's a surprise. Wait right here.

05:34.167 --> 05:40.288
I found it in the garage
when I was looking for the canvas.

05:40.757 --> 05:43.419
It runs on batteries.
I thought maybe it would cheer me up.

05:43.593 --> 05:45.424
Cheer us both up.

05:45.971 --> 05:48.462
Okay, what do you wanna hear?

05:50.976 --> 05:52.716
Crowded house.

07:54.516 --> 07:56.757
Hello!

08:02.190 --> 08:04.306
Is anybody here?

08:06.528 --> 08:08.519
Is anybody here?

08:25.797 --> 08:27.788
Giddyup, boy.

08:38.476 --> 08:40.137
Larry: Hello?

08:43.523 --> 08:46.060
Is anybody there?

08:47.694 --> 08:49.935
Is anybody anywhere?

08:50.447 --> 08:52.187
Nadine: Over here

08:52.824 --> 08:54.405
Larry: Where?

08:55.410 --> 08:57.321
Keep shouting.

08:57.454 --> 09:00.070
I don't believe I need to.

09:04.586 --> 09:06.122
You're not gonna shoot me, are you?

09:06.254 --> 09:08.711
- Are you dangerous?
- I don't know

09:09.591 --> 09:12.924
no. No, I'm not dangerous.

09:21.811 --> 09:24.018
Oh, man.

09:28.443 --> 09:31.150
I can smell your perfume.

09:35.450 --> 09:38.567
I'm glad to see you too.

09:38.745 --> 09:42.863
Except for the birds, we may be the
only living creatures in this entire city.

09:44.375 --> 09:46.491
Don't you believe it.

09:47.504 --> 09:50.371
Because there are a lot
of dangerous people out there.

09:50.882 --> 09:53.965
Some of them
are every bit as healthy as we are.

09:54.094 --> 09:57.006
So my gun
might not be such a bad idea?

09:57.889 --> 09:59.379
No

10:00.600 --> 10:02.056
No

10:07.148 --> 10:08.763
You know something?

10:14.405 --> 10:16.987
I've seen this guy before.

10:19.119 --> 10:22.452
In Times Square,
just before everything went to hell.

10:23.248 --> 10:26.115
Screaming about monsters.

10:26.251 --> 10:28.708
Now, he said they were coming.

10:29.504 --> 10:31.244
He was right.

10:54.904 --> 10:56.986
Larry: How rare did you want it?

10:57.157 --> 10:59.990
Just run it through a warm room.

11:02.287 --> 11:05.745
You know,
I was hoping you'd say that.

11:05.915 --> 11:08.622
Ohh. Wow, ta-da.

11:08.793 --> 11:10.875
Thank you. Thank you.

11:12.088 --> 11:14.295
Nadine: Mmm.
- It's barely breathing.

11:17.802 --> 11:20.839
Oh, I think I lost my appetite.

11:21.431 --> 11:22.841
We gotta get out of here.

11:22.974 --> 11:24.384
I beg your pardon?

11:24.559 --> 11:26.925
I mean, we gotta get out of the city.

11:27.645 --> 11:29.727
I mean, it's not just the odds
of getting shot.

11:29.898 --> 11:33.607
Do you have any idea what it's
gonna smell like in two weeks?

11:33.735 --> 11:37.319
Five million people
rotting in the July sun.

11:37.488 --> 11:40.230
Okay. I need a...

11:40.450 --> 11:41.690
What is that?

11:43.369 --> 11:44.825
Vitamin c.

11:48.666 --> 11:51.453
Yeah, I'm sorry.
It's none of my business.

11:51.669 --> 11:54.206
Apology accepted.

11:55.215 --> 11:58.924
Mostly because I think you're right.
The big apple is baked.

12:02.305 --> 12:05.638
Do you really want me to go with you,
Larry?

12:05.808 --> 12:08.470
Well, yeah. You betcha.

12:10.980 --> 12:12.436
(00d.

12:13.149 --> 12:14.264
When?

12:17.612 --> 12:18.977
Larry: Well

12:21.074 --> 12:23.281
I'd say the sooner, the better.

12:24.911 --> 12:26.572
Where?

12:27.872 --> 12:29.032
We go west.

12:29.958 --> 12:32.074
Towards Nebraska.

12:32.252 --> 12:35.494
There's a town
called hemingford home.

12:35.672 --> 12:36.957
Nebraska”? Why Nebraska?

12:37.674 --> 12:40.040
I've been having
these dreams about it.

12:40.843 --> 12:44.256
An old black woman,
calls herself mother abagail.

12:44.681 --> 12:47.969
Town's real enough.
I checked the road atlas.

12:49.143 --> 12:52.510
You mean you're having visions
of an old black woman?

12:54.691 --> 12:56.101
Yeah

12:58.027 --> 12:59.608
you haven't had dreams like that?

13:16.629 --> 13:20.121
No, I don't dream. I never dream.

13:21.509 --> 13:24.922
Wait. Nadine.

13:38.318 --> 13:39.603
We should.

13:39.736 --> 13:41.977
We should get out of this graveyard.

13:46.534 --> 13:49.697
Flagg:
How I love to love Nadine.

14:00.965 --> 14:02.876
Lloyd: Hey!

14:03.634 --> 14:06.671
Hey, can anybody hear me?

14:12.518 --> 14:15.260
Hey, let me out.

14:17.023 --> 14:20.015
I et me out of here.

14:34.123 --> 14:36.034
You have to.

14:37.710 --> 14:40.167
I'm gonna starve if you don't.

14:44.008 --> 14:46.294
I'm gonna starve to death.

14:47.929 --> 14:49.715
Starve.

15:00.983 --> 15:03.019
Just in case.

15:03.694 --> 15:04.694
Just in case.

15:07.407 --> 15:09.693
Emergency supplies.

15:15.331 --> 15:18.698
Hey! Hey!

15:19.252 --> 15:21.914
Anybody!

15:29.595 --> 15:32.962
Can you dig your man?

15:33.141 --> 15:35.632
He's a righteous man
he's a righteous man

15:35.810 --> 15:39.803
baby, can you dig your man?

15:40.731 --> 15:42.331
He's a righteous man
he's a righteous man

15:42.483 --> 15:45.941
baby, can you dig your man?

16:28.112 --> 16:31.354
Bombs away!

16:35.745 --> 16:37.025
And I didn't come here

16:37.163 --> 16:38.163
bumpty-bumpty-bump

16:38.331 --> 16:40.868
and I didn't come here
thumpty-thumpty-thump

16:41.042 --> 16:43.033
and I didn't come here
thumpty-thumpty-thump

16:43.211 --> 16:44.211
boy 1: Hey, trash.

16:44.378 --> 16:47.620
What did old lady semple say when
you torched her pension check?

16:47.840 --> 16:48.840
Who's there?

16:49.008 --> 16:51.465
Boy 2: People who play with fire
wet the bed, trash.

16:51.636 --> 16:54.628
Boy 1: Gonna stick you in the
nuthatch up in terre haute, trash.

16:54.805 --> 16:55.965
Stick you in the nuthatch

16:56.182 --> 16:58.889
and give you a few thousand
shock treatments.

16:59.018 --> 17:00.098
Shut up!

17:00.311 --> 17:02.848
Girl:
Aah! Keep him away from me.

17:04.357 --> 17:07.064
Boy 2: Hey, trash,
why did you burn up the school?

17:12.156 --> 17:14.522
Flagg: No one's there, trash.

17:15.409 --> 17:17.695
They're all dead.
They can't hurt you anymore.

17:17.870 --> 17:18.870
Can't hurt me.

17:19.038 --> 17:20.278
Flagg: Can't tease you anymore.

17:20.414 --> 17:23.872
Can't tease me. Not anymore.

17:25.753 --> 17:27.584
Bumpty-bump.

17:29.966 --> 17:32.298
My life for you.

17:39.684 --> 17:42.471
There. Bumpty-bump.

17:42.645 --> 17:44.727
Flagg: Go, trashy. Run, now.

17:44.855 --> 17:46.516
My life for you!

18:27.231 --> 18:28.846
Bumpty-bump!

18:29.066 --> 18:30.806
Flagg: Trashcan man.

18:35.615 --> 18:36.946
Trashcan man.

18:38.200 --> 18:41.283
What? Where are you?

18:41.454 --> 18:43.319
Flagg: Everywhere.

18:43.497 --> 18:47.160
I will place you high in my councils,
trash.

18:47.335 --> 18:52.170
And I will set you to burn.

18:54.175 --> 18:57.167
My life for you.

18:58.638 --> 19:01.129
My life for you.

19:19.283 --> 19:22.025
All right, lord. Whoo.

19:22.203 --> 19:24.114
Those prunes did the trick.

19:24.288 --> 19:27.906
But my, don't they taste nasty.

19:35.216 --> 19:39.334
Once in every generation,

19:39.512 --> 19:43.596
the plague shall fall among men.

19:44.600 --> 19:46.932
That's what it says in the book.

19:48.729 --> 19:53.598
Seems like you maybe went
a little too far this time, though.

19:56.654 --> 19:59.111
Rats in the corn, lord.

19:59.824 --> 20:02.736
And the rats are his, ain't they?

20:03.911 --> 20:06.118
Welladay.

20:19.176 --> 20:23.044
I feel them
coming in my direction.

20:23.597 --> 20:29.638
Some of them will be going on to him,
won't they?

20:45.202 --> 20:49.696
I hear you, lord,
and I'm in the way of doing your will,

20:49.874 --> 20:53.082
but I don't much like it.

20:54.670 --> 20:58.288
A hundred six years old
seems a might long in the tooth

20:58.466 --> 21:03.802
to be leading the children of Israel
out of Egypt.

21:04.513 --> 21:08.552
Or the children of America
into Colorado.

21:21.655 --> 21:24.146
Doctor said cut out the coffee.

21:26.577 --> 21:29.239
But I just have only one cup a day.

21:29.413 --> 21:31.620
He had two cups a day.

21:34.335 --> 21:37.873
Besides, he's dead and I'm alive.

21:42.343 --> 21:44.425
Oh, I'll do what you say, lord.

21:44.595 --> 21:47.302
Don't I always?

21:47.973 --> 21:52.842
But even your own son prayed
that the cup be taken from his lips.

21:52.978 --> 21:56.266
And I'm praying the same thing.

21:57.608 --> 22:00.270
Probably get
about the same answer too.

22:10.704 --> 22:16.825
What a friend we have in Jesus

22:25.302 --> 22:28.385
I got the lord to protect me.

22:28.556 --> 22:31.263
I'm ain't scared of the likes of you.

22:31.433 --> 22:33.344
Flagg:
I think you lie, old woman.

22:35.145 --> 22:37.227
Get thee hence, low spirit.

22:37.815 --> 22:40.557
Turn them away if they come, mother.

22:41.235 --> 22:45.023
Take my advice. Turn them away.

22:45.698 --> 22:51.785
What a friend we have in Jesus

22:52.162 --> 22:54.153
all our sins and griefs to bear

22:54.331 --> 22:57.789
your blood is in my fists, mother.

22:59.044 --> 23:05.256
Abagail:
What a privilege to carry

23:07.011 --> 23:10.845
everything to god in prayer

23:21.942 --> 23:27.687
Dear lord,
take this evil vision from my sight.

23:46.133 --> 23:51.093
If it's your will
to bring them on, god,

23:51.221 --> 23:55.840
better do it before I lose my guts.

23:56.018 --> 23:57.633
Amen.

24:26.131 --> 24:27.837
Flagg: Yoo-hoo.

24:28.467 --> 24:29.957
Anybody home?

24:30.135 --> 24:31.966
Help me!

24:32.680 --> 24:34.090
I'm down here.

24:34.264 --> 24:36.630
Please. Please, help me.

24:44.984 --> 24:48.897
Flagg:
You sound pretty hungry, rabbit.

25:09.925 --> 25:12.792
Could you let me out of here, mister?
I'll do anything you want.

25:17.641 --> 25:19.882
You poor guy.

25:20.519 --> 25:21.975
You look like ca-ca.

25:24.606 --> 25:25.891
Tell me something, Lloyd.

25:26.066 --> 25:27.556
How do you know my name?

25:27.818 --> 25:29.604
Lucky guess.

25:30.487 --> 25:32.773
How'd you stay alive so long?

25:32.948 --> 25:35.815
I saw it coming down
and I saved up some food, that's how.

25:41.081 --> 25:42.992
Flagg: Br'er rat how'd he taste?

25:51.258 --> 25:54.000
Poke should be here, not me.
Everything was poke's idea.

25:54.178 --> 25:56.385
And you got stuck
with nothing to eat but rat tartare.

25:56.555 --> 25:59.592
Bad luck.
Worst damn luck I ever heard of

26:01.018 --> 26:04.306
but it could just be that your luck's
on the change, Lloyd.

26:04.480 --> 26:05.811
I ook here.

26:15.365 --> 26:16.525
My god.

26:16.658 --> 26:18.887
Wait a minute, son. Wait a minute.

26:18.911 --> 26:20.697
You ain't seen nothing yet.

26:27.461 --> 26:28.701
Not bad, huh?

26:30.339 --> 26:31.670
Oh.

26:32.466 --> 26:34.673
I never even introduced myself, did I?

26:34.843 --> 26:37.380
Pleased to meet you, Lloyd.
Hope you guessed my name.

26:38.013 --> 26:39.423
Lloyd: Huh? - Oh.

26:39.598 --> 26:41.964
Nothing.
Just a little classical reference.

26:42.142 --> 26:46.306
Actually, my name's flagg.
Randall flagg.

26:46.480 --> 26:48.687
And before I open up this cell door
and take you out

26:48.857 --> 26:50.813
for a couple of cheeseburgers
and fries,

26:50.943 --> 26:54.561
I think we ought to have ourselves
a little understanding.

26:55.447 --> 26:57.859
I'm gonna make you my foreman,
Lloyd.

26:58.867 --> 27:00.987
I'm gonna slip the keys to the kingdom
into your hand.

27:01.120 --> 27:02.860
I pick you.

27:03.664 --> 27:04.744
Do you understand that?

27:04.957 --> 27:06.948
I pick you.

27:08.544 --> 27:11.377
Anyone ever done that for you
in your whole miserable life?

27:11.588 --> 27:13.203
No

27:15.342 --> 27:19.301
Not even poke. We just,
you know, sort of fell together.

27:19.471 --> 27:24.135
And then, I just...

27:24.309 --> 27:27.176
After that, I just kind of, you know,
got left here.

27:27.354 --> 27:29.060
Flagg: Kind of got left here.

27:29.273 --> 27:30.479
Yeah

27:30.649 --> 27:32.890
well, that's one way of putting it,
I suppose.

27:35.904 --> 27:37.784
Would you like to get back
at the kind of people

27:37.948 --> 27:41.987
who'd leave a man to die
in a jail cell like a... well, like him?

27:43.912 --> 27:46.494
Yeah. Yeah, you bet I would.

27:46.623 --> 27:48.488
Flagg: Of course you would.

27:48.625 --> 27:51.162
But I got a feeling
you're somebody special, Lloyd.

27:51.336 --> 27:53.372
A real find.

27:53.547 --> 27:58.337
Not exactly a quiz kid,
but you are the first.

27:58.510 --> 28:00.592
I'm even gonna put you ahead
of trashcan man.

28:00.804 --> 28:02.089
Who?

28:02.222 --> 28:03.928
Never mind.

28:04.391 --> 28:06.632
All I need is your word
that we're gonna stick together.

28:06.810 --> 28:08.801
No backstabbing,
no falling asleep on the watch.

28:08.979 --> 28:11.561
Just you and me, Lloyd.
Win or lose, stand or fall.

28:13.984 --> 28:15.440
You give me your promise,

28:15.652 --> 28:17.688
I give you the key.

28:18.655 --> 28:20.611
I promise.

28:30.751 --> 28:32.457
You're free, Lloyd. Come on out.

28:55.108 --> 28:56.894
Is that mine?

29:08.247 --> 29:09.703
Mine?

29:12.626 --> 29:14.082
Shall we bite some chow now?

29:14.253 --> 29:16.744
Bite some chow? Yes, you bet.

29:16.922 --> 29:19.834
There's a lot to do.
And we have to work fast.

29:20.008 --> 29:22.124
- But we can do it, can't we, Lloyd?
- Yes, you bet.

29:22.261 --> 29:24.172
Flagg:
You and me, soldier. You and me.

29:39.653 --> 29:42.395
Larry, I can't do it.

29:46.493 --> 29:48.279
I can't do it.

29:49.371 --> 29:51.862
Sure you can. I'll be with you.

29:52.040 --> 29:55.703
No, no, no, you don't understand.
I can't do it.

29:55.919 --> 29:59.252
Dark, confined places.
I can't do it, I'll go crazy.

30:01.133 --> 30:02.623
That's great.

30:02.843 --> 30:04.504
I'm sorry.

30:08.098 --> 30:10.510
That's just great, Nadine.

30:10.976 --> 30:13.433
Why you didn't tell me this
before we got 60 or so blocks

30:13.603 --> 30:16.390
from the George Washington bridge
is beyond me, but...

30:16.606 --> 30:18.813
Because I thought I could do it.

30:21.737 --> 30:25.400
Why me, huh? Why me?

30:25.615 --> 30:27.697
And you've had plenty of those,
thank you very much.

30:27.826 --> 30:29.862
- Give that back.
- No, ma'am.

30:30.037 --> 30:33.370
I'm not gonna stand here
in the middle of 5 million dead people

30:33.540 --> 30:35.906
and watch you commit suicide.

30:36.126 --> 30:37.866
No!

30:40.589 --> 30:41.589
Damn you.

30:44.634 --> 30:46.966
Okay. Where are you going?

30:47.137 --> 30:50.379
Going to the George Washington
bridge by myself.

30:53.435 --> 30:56.927
Larry: I don't need
this prima Donna act, missy.

30:57.064 --> 30:58.770
I really don't.

30:58.982 --> 31:00.973
You have fun
getting raped and murdered

31:01.151 --> 31:04.814
back on 7th Avenue, sweetheart.

31:11.661 --> 31:13.697
Terrific.

31:20.003 --> 31:23.336
Nadine. Come on back.

31:23.507 --> 31:25.919
This is crazy.

31:26.593 --> 31:28.333
I'm sorry, okay?

31:28.553 --> 31:30.714
If it has to be the bridge, that's fine.

31:30.889 --> 31:33.255
Just don't do it alone.

31:38.897 --> 31:40.353
Yeah

31:41.441 --> 31:43.477
the hell with you.

31:50.325 --> 31:52.691
I'm going in now.

32:50.510 --> 32:53.752
Come on, don't look at them, stupid.

33:18.288 --> 33:19.448
Larry?

34:34.406 --> 34:35.521
Larry: Who's there?

34:37.742 --> 34:40.108
Identify yourself.

34:41.454 --> 34:44.446
Come on, identity yourself.

34:45.417 --> 34:49.251
You better start talking
before I start shooting here.

34:49.462 --> 34:53.296
Come on! Come on.

34:53.466 --> 34:54.751
Come on.

34:58.013 --> 35:02.177
Nadine:
Larry. Please stop shooting.

35:03.518 --> 35:04.678
Nadine?

35:06.104 --> 35:08.060
You stay where you are,
do you hear me?

35:16.948 --> 35:20.941
Larry, Larry, Larry.

35:21.077 --> 35:23.318
- Larry
- Are you hurt? Did I shoot you?

35:23.538 --> 35:25.074
No, but I felt the wind.

35:25.248 --> 35:27.239
L... one came so close,
I felt the wind of it.

35:27.417 --> 35:31.035
And the chips, tile chips,
they got on my face.

35:31.212 --> 35:32.497
I think I cut my face.

35:32.672 --> 35:34.003
Oh, god. I'm so sorry.

35:34.174 --> 35:35.459
- It's okay.
- I'm sorry.

35:35.634 --> 35:36.634
- It's okay.
- I'm sorry.

35:36.801 --> 35:38.337
- It's okay.
- You okay?

35:38.511 --> 35:40.627
Oh, Nadine.

35:40.805 --> 35:43.638
Are you still mad at me
about the pills?

35:43.808 --> 35:45.014
No, no, no.

35:45.185 --> 35:48.097
- Because I won't take the pills, Larry.
- It's okay.

35:48.271 --> 35:51.183
It's okay, Nadine. It's okay.

35:51.358 --> 35:54.475
Oh, god. Oh, god.

36:16.257 --> 36:18.669
Oh, dear god.

36:38.947 --> 36:44.658
I tell you,
Jersey never smelled so good.

37:01.886 --> 37:06.380
Baby, can you dig your man?

37:07.350 --> 37:12.936
He's got a righteous gland

37:13.064 --> 37:19.151
baby, can you dig your man?

37:19.320 --> 37:21.561
Stu: I don't think you're singing that
just right.

37:23.074 --> 37:24.780
Take it easy.

37:25.452 --> 37:27.659
It's okay. I'm a friend.

37:27.787 --> 37:30.950
Well, I certainly hope so. Uh...

37:31.708 --> 37:37.999
Oh. Well, just think of it
as home defense while on the road.

37:38.173 --> 37:39.173
Glen: All right.

37:39.382 --> 37:41.418
All right, I certainly will.

37:41.593 --> 37:43.424
Glen Bateman at your service.

37:43.595 --> 37:45.506
Stu redman,
originally from east Texas.

37:45.638 --> 37:47.253
Well

37:47.390 --> 37:50.598
Kojak, say hello to stu redman.

37:50.810 --> 37:53.267
Such a miserable dog. Ha-ha-ha.

37:53.438 --> 37:56.430
Well, don't be too hard on him. Hey.

37:57.400 --> 38:00.733
He's the first dog I've seen in...

38:01.905 --> 38:04.988
Well, since the third week of June.

38:05.158 --> 38:07.945
Yeah. The superflu
took most of the dogs.

38:08.119 --> 38:12.328
Right along with their idiot masters.
Most unfair.

38:13.333 --> 38:14.994
Stu: Say, uh...

38:15.919 --> 38:19.832
Might not be a bad idea
to paint with your glasses on.

38:20.006 --> 38:22.418
Not when you paint like I do.

38:57.335 --> 39:00.042
Nadine: Mm I I can't do this.

39:00.213 --> 39:01.853
- Sorry, I'm just...
Larry: Sure, you can.

39:02.006 --> 39:03.871
Nadine: You know, I just...
You can.

39:04.092 --> 39:06.879
Sure, you can. You can do anything.

39:07.053 --> 39:09.135
You can do anything.

39:13.059 --> 39:16.051
Nadine: No. No, I can't.

39:29.075 --> 39:30.281
I want you.

39:37.959 --> 39:38.959
I know, but...

39:39.127 --> 39:41.118
Larry: Do you want me?

39:42.714 --> 39:44.625
I know you do.

39:45.592 --> 39:48.379
So, what's the problem?

39:48.553 --> 39:51.670
I just...

39:53.474 --> 39:55.931
Need more time.

39:58.563 --> 40:00.804
It's the dreams, huh?

40:02.150 --> 40:03.981
No. I told you, I don't dream.

40:04.152 --> 40:05.733
Come on, Nadine.

40:06.321 --> 40:07.982
Come on.

40:09.991 --> 40:12.403
I have the same dreams.

40:15.705 --> 40:18.663
Well, I don't know anything about that.

40:18.791 --> 40:20.531
I just...

40:21.920 --> 40:23.660
I just, um...

40:24.213 --> 40:27.000
I just need more time.

40:29.636 --> 40:31.467
Yeah, sure.

40:33.473 --> 40:34.588
Time I got.

40:36.601 --> 40:38.307
Thank you.

40:56.496 --> 41:02.958
Abagail:
What a friend we have in Jesus

41:04.003 --> 41:09.293
all our sins and griefs to bear

41:12.762 --> 41:17.381
folks around these parts
just call me mother abagail.

41:17.558 --> 41:22.427
You'll be coming along to see me,
won't you, Larry?

41:23.147 --> 41:24.353
Larry: Yeah

41:25.566 --> 41:27.978
hemingford home.

41:28.861 --> 41:30.897
Or Boulder.

41:31.406 --> 41:33.943
One place or the other.

41:40.540 --> 41:43.657
So cold.

41:43.793 --> 41:47.661
No. He's warm, not you.

41:48.297 --> 41:51.039
But I'm the one you belong to, Nadine.

41:51.217 --> 41:52.502
You are the promised one.

41:52.719 --> 41:56.382
Why me? Who promised?

41:57.098 --> 41:58.304
Flagg: Shh.

41:58.891 --> 42:00.756
It doesn't matter.

42:06.065 --> 42:09.683
Nadine. My love.

42:11.529 --> 42:15.113
As long as you hide your mind
from the old woman, you'll be fine.

42:16.909 --> 42:19.776
But when you come to me, we'll be

42:19.954 --> 42:22.491
married. Married.

42:23.249 --> 42:26.412
But I want you to leave
the one you're traveling with.

42:26.836 --> 42:27.836
Tonight.

42:28.046 --> 42:30.913
I can handle Larry. He's just a boy.

42:33.176 --> 42:34.176
Flagg: I eave him.

42:34.802 --> 42:36.087
I eave him.

42:36.304 --> 42:37.635
Oh, god. You hear me?

42:37.805 --> 42:40.922
- Oh, no!
- I. Eave him.

43:06.626 --> 43:08.491
Nadine?

43:12.757 --> 43:15.214
Nadine: Larry, by the time
you read this, I'll be gone.

43:15.426 --> 43:17.712
If I stay, we'll end up
sleeping together

43:17.887 --> 43:19.093
and I can't have that.

43:19.263 --> 43:21.879
I have my reasons.
Thanks for being there.

43:22.058 --> 43:25.221
I'll see you again.
Much love, Nadine.

43:27.063 --> 43:29.600
You were right about the dreams.

44:31.669 --> 44:32.909
Hey, mister, watch out!

44:44.682 --> 44:46.798
Holy gee, mister.

44:47.018 --> 44:48.929
Oh, but you took a tumble,
didn't you just?

44:49.103 --> 44:50.183
My laws.

44:52.273 --> 44:56.516
I'm sorry if I scared you, mister,
but you scared me too.

44:56.694 --> 44:59.276
You're the first person I've seen
in just about forever.

45:04.869 --> 45:07.781
I made that, mister. You like it?

45:10.291 --> 45:11.451
You bet!

45:11.626 --> 45:14.117
I got them dummies
from the window of lannens

45:14.295 --> 45:16.126
on highway to okie city.

45:16.339 --> 45:20.548
Thought a few decorations
would cheer up main street.

45:20.718 --> 45:23.835
It's been awful sad
with everyone gone.

45:24.305 --> 45:25.305
Do you like them?

45:28.768 --> 45:30.099
Thanks!

45:30.269 --> 45:32.601
Decoration is my hobby.

45:32.772 --> 45:35.730
M-o-o-n. That spells hobby.

45:37.860 --> 45:41.444
Do you want to go on up the street
to the drugstore and get a band-aid?

45:42.240 --> 45:43.901
We can just take it if we want.

45:44.033 --> 45:46.820
Everyone's gone.
So it's not like stealing.

45:53.292 --> 45:54.873
Sure don't talk much, do you?

46:05.930 --> 46:08.763
I'm sorry, mister. I can't read.

46:12.144 --> 46:13.850
Just a few little words is all

46:14.063 --> 46:15.143
I went to school.

46:15.314 --> 46:18.522
I made it to the third grade,
but then I kind of pooped out.

46:18.693 --> 46:21.355
Oh, I could read
some curious George when I left,

46:21.529 --> 46:24.521
but since then I kind of forgot.

46:51.267 --> 46:53.053
I'm sorry, mister. I don't get you.

47:01.569 --> 47:05.778
My daddy always said
I was a little slow on the upchuck.

47:06.198 --> 47:07.984
That's a joke.

47:08.159 --> 47:11.401
Oh, my daddy
was always joking around.

47:18.461 --> 47:21.043
I got it, mister! I got it!

47:21.213 --> 47:24.330
You're just like
old albain packlot's hired man.

47:24.508 --> 47:26.590
Tom Cullen knows what that is.

47:26.761 --> 47:30.595
M-o-0-0o-n,
that spells deaf and dumb!

47:45.071 --> 47:46.936
When are they all coming back,
mister?

47:49.158 --> 47:52.525
Oh, I know where they went.
Laws, ves.

47:52.703 --> 47:55.695
They up and went to Kansas City.

47:55.831 --> 48:00.495
Everybody's, they're always
talking about what a dull town this is

48:03.214 --> 48:06.672
and there's just the drive-in theater
out on route 61

48:06.842 --> 48:10.050
and all they show
is them dilly-dally pictures

48:10.262 --> 48:12.298
and they're all rated x.

48:12.431 --> 48:15.218
M-o-0o-n, that spells x.

48:16.811 --> 48:20.599
So they all went
to Kansas City and...

48:22.566 --> 48:26.434
Except my mama.
She caught a cold and died.

48:27.071 --> 48:30.154
I put her in the cemetery my own self.

48:31.617 --> 48:34.984
So she didn't go to Kansas City
with the rest of them.

48:35.162 --> 48:36.777
She's up in heaven.

48:36.914 --> 48:40.031
She's eating the bread of life
with Jesus.

48:56.350 --> 49:00.810
Mister, if you're going to Kansas City,
can I go with you?

49:00.980 --> 49:05.144
I ain't never been.
I don't wanna stay here anymore.

49:05.317 --> 49:09.060
It's lonely and it's scary at night.

49:33.345 --> 49:34.710
Drive a car?

49:34.889 --> 49:38.757
Tom Cullen? Laws, no!

49:40.811 --> 49:43.974
I guess you can't drive
a car either, huh?

49:55.367 --> 49:58.609
Tom:
I got just the thing for you, ma'am.

50:03.375 --> 50:05.081
Hey, mister! Nice bike.

50:05.252 --> 50:07.117
Who's it for?

50:13.177 --> 50:16.340
You want me to go with you?
To Kansas City?

50:20.226 --> 50:21.762
To see the old black lady?

50:30.069 --> 50:33.982
That's right.
She lives in a little house in the corn.

50:34.156 --> 50:37.569
She plays her guitar on the porch.

50:37.743 --> 50:40.075
I don't mind going to see her,

50:40.246 --> 50:42.703
but we won't go see the other one,
will we?

50:42.831 --> 50:46.494
The one who turns into a crow
and flies away?

50:47.670 --> 50:54.291
Oh, he wears boots and jeans
and a jacket with special buttons on it.

50:54.468 --> 50:56.379
Face buttons.

50:56.512 --> 51:00.221
He looks like a man,
but I don't think he's really a man.

51:00.391 --> 51:02.677
We won't go near him,
will we, mister?

51:04.353 --> 51:05.763
Well, okay then!

51:05.938 --> 51:09.476
All right, I'm ready! Laws, yes!

51:09.650 --> 51:13.359
M-o-0o-n, that spells ready.

51:24.832 --> 51:26.413
Whoo-hoo!

51:26.584 --> 51:31.248
M-o-0o-n, that spells Nebraska.

51:56.947 --> 52:02.658
Time to get going, Stuart.
You come see me.

52:02.870 --> 52:04.781
Who are you?

52:05.831 --> 52:08.914
- Who are you, really?
Abagail: Your last hope.

52:09.752 --> 52:15.167
If you miss me in hemingford home,
we'll be moving on to Colorado.

52:17.217 --> 52:20.084
Boulder, but...

52:21.722 --> 52:23.087
The rats are his.

53:09.645 --> 53:11.681
Stay away from her, east Texas.

53:12.272 --> 53:15.184
Stay away or you'll all die!

53:23.992 --> 53:26.074
The plague! Aah!

53:30.124 --> 53:32.831
Abagail:
You come on along and see me.

53:33.001 --> 53:35.708
You and all your friends.

53:40.467 --> 53:42.833
Stu: The damn dreams are gonna
drive me crazy

53:43.011 --> 53:44.876
if I don't do something.

53:45.889 --> 53:50.383
So I'm gonna go to Nebraska.
I gotta find out what this means.

53:50.936 --> 53:53.848
- You wanna come with me?
Glen: Why not?

53:54.022 --> 53:57.105
Always assuming we can find
a motorcycle with a sidecar.

53:57.276 --> 53:58.812
I'm not leaving Kojak.

54:00.195 --> 54:02.561
Well, you don't sound
very enthusiastic.

54:02.740 --> 54:06.653
Well, when I lose sleep, I get cranky.

54:09.455 --> 54:10.535
Bad dreams?

54:13.000 --> 54:16.367
The name of the guy in the desert
is flagg.

54:16.545 --> 54:20.458
And I think he's crucifying anyone
who gets in his way.

54:25.137 --> 54:30.348
Let's say we go out there to Nebraska
and the old woman is there.

54:30.476 --> 54:33.809
Glen: "Folks around these parts
call me mother abagail.

54:34.021 --> 54:38.515
I'm 106 years old
and still make my own bread."

54:39.485 --> 54:41.271
Yeah, that's her.

54:41.445 --> 54:44.357
Let's say she's real. Then what?

54:44.573 --> 54:47.315
Well, it's obvious
she's some sort of magnet.

54:47.493 --> 54:50.906
So I suppose we start building
the whole sorry mess up again.

54:51.038 --> 54:52.903
Using her as magnetic north.
Shh.

54:54.708 --> 54:56.073
You hear that”?

55:25.072 --> 55:27.734
Fran: Hi. Stu: Hi.

55:30.702 --> 55:32.408
How you doing?

55:33.872 --> 55:36.864
I'm stu redman.
This here's Glen Bateman.

55:37.042 --> 55:38.077
Fran: Hi

55:38.252 --> 55:40.789
and that furry one over there,
that's Kojak.

55:40.963 --> 55:42.669
Fran goldsmith.

55:43.841 --> 55:47.550
- We're glad to meet you.
- And we're glad to see you.

55:47.719 --> 55:50.301
- Aren't we, Harold?
- Well, I don't know.

55:50.472 --> 55:52.212
I mean, do we assume
that they're all right

55:52.391 --> 55:54.191
just because they remember
how to shake hands?

55:56.019 --> 55:58.806
No harm intended here, mister...?

56:00.232 --> 56:03.816
- Lauder, Harold lauder.
- I auder.

56:03.986 --> 56:08.901
Oh, Harold, I don't think I'm ever
gonna get these calluses off my Fanny.

56:10.075 --> 56:11.315
Where are you folks headed?

56:11.493 --> 56:13.484
Harold: To stovington.
Fran: Nebraska.

56:13.996 --> 56:15.532
Harold: Vermont.

56:18.917 --> 56:19.917
What?

56:21.587 --> 56:22.872
What's wrong?

56:23.755 --> 56:26.963
Going to stovington
would be a waste of your time.

56:27.885 --> 56:30.092
I hardly think
you're the best judge of that.

56:30.220 --> 56:31.551
Glen: He was there

56:31.763 --> 56:33.549
and he knows. They tried to kill him.

56:33.724 --> 56:36.386
Really? Stu: Yeah

56:38.103 --> 56:39.889
look, uh...

56:41.481 --> 56:45.850
Glen and I were about ready
to head to Nebraska.

56:47.154 --> 56:51.648
We've been having the same dream.

56:51.825 --> 56:54.066
The dreams are an aberration.

56:56.413 --> 56:57.413
Well, maybe.

56:57.581 --> 57:00.823
But, uh, we're all headed
in the same direction.

57:00.959 --> 57:02.495
- Why don't we go together?
Fran: Okay.

57:02.669 --> 57:05.001
No. Harold.

57:06.465 --> 57:08.205
I don't like the looks of them.

57:09.635 --> 57:10.841
This one in particular.

57:16.475 --> 57:18.841
Come here.
Can I talk to you for a second?

57:19.978 --> 57:22.264
Come on, come on.

57:28.403 --> 57:30.485
Okay, I'm gonna talk straight
to you now.

57:30.656 --> 57:32.863
Okay”? Between you and me?

57:33.951 --> 57:36.863
I do not want to cut in on you here.

57:37.037 --> 57:40.200
I mean, that's the last thing
in the world that I want.

57:41.959 --> 57:44.826
Relax. The last thing in the world.

58:03.397 --> 58:05.137
Here you go.

58:08.026 --> 58:09.106
- Okay?
- No, thanks.

58:09.277 --> 58:10.892
You sure?

58:12.531 --> 58:13.862
Okay.

58:14.992 --> 58:16.323
Glen.

58:18.954 --> 58:21.161
Not bad cold.

58:21.331 --> 58:22.571
Stu: Enjoy it.

58:22.749 --> 58:27.038
I have a feeling there's gonna be
a shortage of cold beer this summer.

58:28.630 --> 58:30.541
Harold:
I still wanna check stovington.

58:30.674 --> 58:32.960
Oh, Harold, why?

58:33.427 --> 58:35.088
Let's just say I'm from Missouri.

58:35.220 --> 58:39.680
And I don't always take the word
of people I just met as gospel.

58:41.059 --> 58:42.390
Stu: All right.

58:44.104 --> 58:47.517
But there isn't anything there
you're gonna want to see.

59:30.275 --> 59:32.391
Still from Missouri?

1:00:00.597 --> 1:00:01.962
You was right.

1:00:02.140 --> 1:00:06.383
I never should have eaten
all them apples. Laws, no.

1:00:12.275 --> 1:00:14.231
Where are you going?

1:00:18.365 --> 1:00:21.027
Don't worry. I ain't going nowhere.

1:00:21.159 --> 1:00:24.071
My legs feel all funny.

1:01:21.511 --> 1:01:22.796
My god.

1:01:23.597 --> 1:01:25.508
Are you real?

1:01:26.766 --> 1:01:28.472
Yow!

1:01:36.318 --> 1:01:37.979
If you're real, say something.

1:01:51.583 --> 1:01:52.868
Are you a deaf-mute?

1:01:59.466 --> 1:02:02.082
Somebody finally shows up
in this crappy town

1:02:02.260 --> 1:02:05.002
and it turns out to be a deaf-mute.

1:02:08.975 --> 1:02:13.719
Well, hi. My name's Julie lawry.

1:02:13.939 --> 1:02:16.225
Oh, can't tell me yours, can you?

1:02:18.693 --> 1:02:20.649
Poor you.

1:02:25.158 --> 1:02:27.399
Does baby have a sad tummy?

1:02:38.755 --> 1:02:40.791
Ain't he a moose?

1:02:47.430 --> 1:02:50.046
"I'm Nick andros.
My friend's Tom Cullen.

1:02:50.225 --> 1:02:53.968
He's mildly retarded. We're go..."

1:02:56.898 --> 1:03:01.232
Oh, a retard and a deaf-mute.
Just my luck.

1:03:01.361 --> 1:03:02.851
What?

1:03:03.029 --> 1:03:04.565
What?

1:03:08.702 --> 1:03:10.533
(Set over here.

1:03:12.914 --> 1:03:16.372
Do all deaf-mutes
have such big guns?

1:03:19.129 --> 1:03:21.541
They do?

1:03:46.740 --> 1:03:47.820
Peekaboo.

1:03:50.035 --> 1:03:52.572
What? What?

1:03:53.038 --> 1:03:54.824
No

1:03:54.998 --> 1:03:58.331
Hold me. You gotta hold me.

1:03:59.419 --> 1:04:01.660
I've been lonely.

1:04:26.196 --> 1:04:28.357
No, no, no, what's that?

1:04:28.573 --> 1:04:31.315
No. He's just a retard.

1:04:31.493 --> 1:04:34.485
He doesn't feel things
the way that you and I do.

1:04:34.662 --> 1:04:36.323
He can wait.

1:04:37.290 --> 1:04:38.826
He can wait.

1:04:39.000 --> 1:04:42.743
He can wait, he can wait,
he can wait.

1:04:47.092 --> 1:04:50.676
No, no. What?

1:04:53.264 --> 1:04:54.299
(Set out.

1:04:55.392 --> 1:04:57.633
Stupid dummy.

1:05:04.192 --> 1:05:07.434
It was those apples. Laws, yes.

1:05:07.612 --> 1:05:09.227
Oh, I don't want it. No, sir.

1:05:09.364 --> 1:05:12.026
L... say, who's that?

1:05:13.660 --> 1:05:16.072
How you doing, cutie-pie?

1:05:16.746 --> 1:05:19.533
I heard you weren't feeling too good.

1:05:20.041 --> 1:05:22.874
Your name's Tom, right?

1:05:23.461 --> 1:05:25.076
Tom Cullen.

1:05:25.255 --> 1:05:30.340
M-0o-0-n, that spells Tom Cullen.
Yes mm-hm.

1:05:30.468 --> 1:05:32.550
I don't want medicine, mister.

1:05:32.679 --> 1:05:34.840
That's right. You know
what I know about that stuff?

1:05:35.014 --> 1:05:36.014
That stuff's poison.

1:05:36.182 --> 1:05:39.549
No, sir!
Tom Cullen doesn't drink poison.

1:05:39.727 --> 1:05:41.183
Daddy said don't you ever.

1:05:41.354 --> 1:05:43.274
Daddy said if it could kill
the rats in the barn,

1:05:43.398 --> 1:05:44.604
it'd kill me too.

1:05:44.774 --> 1:05:47.311
Please.
Don't make me drink it, mister.

1:05:47.485 --> 1:05:50.067
Please! Julie: No!

1:05:50.655 --> 1:05:54.239
His daddy said don't do it.
Don't make him do it.

1:06:02.000 --> 1:06:03.991
I got mighty mouse here
with pink lips

1:06:04.169 --> 1:06:08.003
and a big old moose over there,
crying just like a baby.

1:06:12.427 --> 1:06:14.383
Dummy-brained bastard.

1:06:25.315 --> 1:06:28.478
Yeah, that's right. You wouldn't dare.

1:06:29.360 --> 1:06:31.066
Please.

1:06:31.571 --> 1:06:34.313
Please, don't fight. Don't fight.

1:06:34.491 --> 1:06:36.152
It's... I feel better now.

1:06:36.326 --> 1:06:38.567
I can go on. See”?

1:06:55.803 --> 1:06:58.795
On, fine. I'll read your crappy note.

1:07:05.188 --> 1:07:07.179
It was just a joke, dummy.

1:07:07.398 --> 1:07:11.732
It was a joke. Aha-ha-ha.
Joke, stupid.

1:07:12.362 --> 1:07:14.694
It was a joke.

1:07:18.034 --> 1:07:20.446
I'm gonna get you.
You and your stupid freak friend.

1:07:20.620 --> 1:07:22.986
I'm gonna get both of you guys.

1:07:49.399 --> 1:07:52.891
I'm sorry, mister. I cried like a baby.

1:07:53.069 --> 1:07:56.561
But she scared me. Laws, yes.

1:08:01.786 --> 1:08:03.617
You too?

1:08:19.387 --> 1:08:24.552
Laws, yes. Let's get out of here
before she comes back.

1:08:29.897 --> 1:08:32.229
She's shooting at us! Mister!

1:08:32.400 --> 1:08:35.062
Come on, mister.
We gotta get out of here.

1:08:36.904 --> 1:08:41.364
Ha-ha! Go on! I wanna see you run!

1:08:43.453 --> 1:08:45.739
Al-yi-yi-yi-yi!

1:08:48.875 --> 1:08:53.494
If I ever see any of you two
in my face again, I'll kill you!

1:09:48.309 --> 1:09:51.426
Hot. Laws, yes!

1:10:00.613 --> 1:10:02.194
What is it?

1:10:07.203 --> 1:10:08.318
Oh, mister.

1:10:08.496 --> 1:10:10.361
Mister, we gotta go. We gotta hide.

1:10:10.581 --> 1:10:13.197
What if it...? That could be her.

1:10:16.838 --> 1:10:19.375
Oh, she's back there. Oh, laws, yes.

1:10:19.549 --> 1:10:25.135
Tom knows that,
but what if that one's like her?

1:10:34.480 --> 1:10:38.723
He might be like us”? Nice, like us?

1:11:12.477 --> 1:11:16.641
Holy crow!
Am I glad to see you fellas.

1:11:18.483 --> 1:11:19.893
You boys headed to Nebraska?

1:11:22.820 --> 1:11:24.310
Tom: My friend can't talk.

1:11:24.489 --> 1:11:27.856
He's deaf and dumb. But he's smart.

1:11:29.952 --> 1:11:33.911
Well, I bet he is.
He got that look, don't he?

1:11:34.332 --> 1:11:35.538
Name's Ralph brentner.

1:11:37.502 --> 1:11:41.871
I'm Tom Cullen.
M-o-o-n, that spells Tom Cullen.

1:11:43.049 --> 1:11:46.257
I don't know his name
because I can't read it.

1:11:46.469 --> 1:11:49.131
Sure wish I did though. Laws, yes.

1:11:59.148 --> 1:12:01.935
Your friend's name here
is Nick andros.

1:12:03.110 --> 1:12:05.943
M-o-o-n, I guess that spells Nick.

1:12:06.113 --> 1:12:09.230
Nick andros, how you doing?

1:12:12.245 --> 1:12:14.577
Why don't you boys climb on in?

1:12:14.747 --> 1:12:17.454
We got some miles to turn before dark.

1:12:53.619 --> 1:12:55.610
Yeah, don't you understand

1:12:55.788 --> 1:12:57.870
what I'm trying to say?

1:12:58.040 --> 1:13:02.249
Yeah, can't you feel the fear
that I'm feeling today?

1:13:02.420 --> 1:13:06.129
If the button is pushed
there'll be no running away

1:13:06.299 --> 1:13:11.043
yeah, no one to save you
from the next grave

1:13:12.722 --> 1:13:16.635
take a look around you, boy
it's bound to scare you, boy

1:13:16.767 --> 1:13:18.849
so don't tell me

1:13:19.020 --> 1:13:23.559
over and over
and over again, my friend

1:13:24.442 --> 1:13:29.937
that you don't believe
we're on the Eve of destruction

1:13:32.241 --> 1:13:37.827
yeah, you don't believe
we're on the Eve of destruction

1:13:40.124 --> 1:13:43.287
oh, thank god! I'm so happy.

1:13:43.461 --> 1:13:47.170
We're so happy to see someone else.
Right, Joe?

1:13:48.049 --> 1:13:52.133
- I'm so pleased to meet you.
- Yeah, same here, believe me.

1:13:52.929 --> 1:13:54.385
How you doing, son?

1:13:55.389 --> 1:13:56.799
Joel “whoa!

1:13:57.016 --> 1:13:59.974
- Put that away.
I arry: Nice kid.

1:14:00.227 --> 1:14:04.220
- Has he had his rabies shots yet?
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

1:14:04.398 --> 1:14:08.937
He's been traumatized.
Haven't we all?

1:14:09.654 --> 1:14:11.019
Lucy: I suppose so.

1:14:15.076 --> 1:14:18.113
I'm Lucy Swann. Yeah.

1:14:21.040 --> 1:14:25.909
The boy, I found him
in a supermarket in Iowa city.

1:14:26.045 --> 1:14:30.129
He was just wandering around
eating sweet stuff.

1:14:30.591 --> 1:14:32.957
Back then he was almost feral

1:14:33.177 --> 1:14:35.418
well, you took him with you anyway?

1:14:36.305 --> 1:14:38.261
He would have died on his own.

1:14:43.813 --> 1:14:45.599
Larry: So, what do you think
happened here?

1:14:45.815 --> 1:14:47.726
I mean,
do you think it was lightning or...?

1:14:48.693 --> 1:14:50.433
Lucy: It started around dusk.

1:14:50.611 --> 1:14:54.274
It was a whole series of explosions
on the West Side of town

1:14:54.407 --> 1:14:56.147
where the tank farms are.

1:14:56.283 --> 1:14:59.320
And then later that night,
there was a wind

1:14:59.495 --> 1:15:02.111
and by morning,
the rest of the city was gone.

1:15:02.289 --> 1:15:04.405
I'd say it was set.

1:15:06.002 --> 1:15:09.039
You think somebody deliberately
burned des moines to the ground?

1:15:10.172 --> 1:15:11.172
Yes

1:15:16.137 --> 1:15:20.221
who'd want to burn a whole city
to the ground, for god's sakes?

1:15:35.114 --> 1:15:38.698
My life for you.

1:15:40.786 --> 1:15:43.493
Flagg:
And I will set you high in my councils

1:15:43.664 --> 1:15:46.497
and I will set you to burn.

1:15:46.667 --> 1:15:48.578
Trashcan man: Oh, thank you.

1:15:49.795 --> 1:15:56.382
Cibola. The city that is promised.

1:16:14.153 --> 1:16:16.189
Thank you, lord.

1:16:16.697 --> 1:16:18.983
I didn't drop it on the floor.

1:16:20.951 --> 1:16:24.910
Now, lord, I ain't picked the corn yet.

1:16:25.081 --> 1:16:30.041
Maybe some of those men
you're sending me will help me out.

1:16:48.687 --> 1:16:51.224
Ralph: Yeehaw!

1:16:51.857 --> 1:16:55.850
Thank you, my lord,
for bringing them through.

1:16:57.738 --> 1:16:59.694
Hello, mother.

1:17:00.866 --> 1:17:05.200
Ralph brentner.
I'm so pleased to meet you.

1:17:07.581 --> 1:17:11.199
We never made a single wrong turn.
Nick here knew just how to come.

1:17:15.381 --> 1:17:17.497
Hello, Nick.

1:17:19.135 --> 1:17:21.968
Glad to see you.

1:17:22.179 --> 1:17:24.135
(Sod bless!

1:17:26.559 --> 1:17:29.596
You've done it, Nick.
You brought them through.

1:17:29.728 --> 1:17:32.060
You're the first of many.

1:17:33.274 --> 1:17:35.265
Y'all welcome here.

1:17:35.442 --> 1:17:39.401
Our time is very short,
but we'll break bread together

1:17:39.572 --> 1:17:42.359
and have some fellowship,
one with the other.

1:17:42.575 --> 1:17:45.112
- Granny-lady?
- What, honey?

1:17:45.244 --> 1:17:50.284
- Are you the oldest lady in the world?
- Shh. Gina, that's not polite.

1:17:51.208 --> 1:17:55.998
Mayhap so, sweetheart.
Mavyhap so.

1:18:09.810 --> 1:18:13.803
That was a dilly of a meal, ma'am.
“Wasn't bad.

1:18:13.981 --> 1:18:16.643
Ralph: Yeah.
- Birds was a little tough.

1:18:16.817 --> 1:18:19.274
But it's a hell of a lot tougher
where there's none,

1:18:19.445 --> 1:18:22.027
my old mama used to say.

1:18:22.364 --> 1:18:27.358
Now, I've made up a cot
for the little one in the back room.

1:18:27.536 --> 1:18:29.322
The woman,
what's her name, Ralph?

1:18:29.496 --> 1:18:31.862
Susan. Susan stern.

1:18:32.041 --> 1:18:33.622
A goodish name.

1:18:33.792 --> 1:18:37.376
Well, she can bunk with the tot.

1:18:39.506 --> 1:18:44.842
How did you know to come to me
in the first place?

1:18:47.473 --> 1:18:49.259
We dreamed of you, mother.

1:18:50.226 --> 1:18:52.717
Of you and the other fella.

1:18:55.022 --> 1:18:56.102
The other fella.

1:18:59.526 --> 1:19:02.438
Susan:
Okay. Come on, you, time for bed.

1:19:02.571 --> 1:19:03.571
Brad: Yes

1:19:03.739 --> 1:19:05.525
Gina: I'm not even tired.
Susan: Too bad.

1:19:05.699 --> 1:19:08.532
(Sod bless the child.

1:19:09.370 --> 1:19:13.909
God bless the child
that's got her own.

1:19:16.293 --> 1:19:21.504
I was told that we're gonna be
like a snowball rolling downhill.

1:19:21.674 --> 1:19:24.962
Picking up other people
as we head west

1:19:25.135 --> 1:19:27.672
told? Told by who, mother?

1:19:27.846 --> 1:19:29.882
Told by god.

1:19:30.099 --> 1:19:32.306
I tried not to hear
what god had to tell me

1:19:32.518 --> 1:19:34.759
but you can see all the good it done.

1:19:38.565 --> 1:19:43.434
You been drafted too, Nick.
God has his finger on your heart.

1:19:44.446 --> 1:19:48.314
And he's got more fingers than one.

1:19:48.534 --> 1:19:53.119
It's dark work ahead
for his chosen ones.

1:19:53.747 --> 1:19:55.453
Dark and bloody.

1:20:09.471 --> 1:20:11.132
Well, ma'am,

1:20:11.640 --> 1:20:14.427
what if this dark man
we've been dreaming about isn't real,

1:20:14.601 --> 1:20:20.141
or what if he's a whatcha-call-it,
a bogeyman?

1:20:20.316 --> 1:20:22.602
You dreamed of me,
am I the bogeyman?

1:20:24.987 --> 1:20:28.946
- No, ma'am.
- He's real, all right.

1:20:29.658 --> 1:20:32.946
And it's our lot to deal with him.

1:20:33.120 --> 1:20:38.660
God don't explain his will
to the likes of Abby freemantle.

1:20:48.344 --> 1:20:49.880
Well?

1:20:52.431 --> 1:20:54.171
Nick says that...

1:20:57.686 --> 1:21:00.598
He says he don't believe in god.

1:21:06.195 --> 1:21:10.404
God bless you, Nick,
but it don't matter.

1:21:10.532 --> 1:21:13.945
He believes in you.

1:21:39.978 --> 1:21:42.219
Oh, I'm fine.

1:21:43.148 --> 1:21:46.436
Just thinking some long thoughts.

1:21:49.780 --> 1:21:53.864
My daddy owned all of this once.

1:21:54.243 --> 1:21:56.905
As far as your eye can see.

1:22:03.752 --> 1:22:09.713
And my brothers lost it
piece at a time after he was gone.

1:22:09.883 --> 1:22:15.628
Finally, the only thing left
was the home place.

1:22:17.224 --> 1:22:20.432
What I said to myself was,

1:22:20.602 --> 1:22:24.094
"don't worry, ab,
they can have the rest.

1:22:24.273 --> 1:22:27.891
I'll hang on to the home place.

1:22:28.986 --> 1:22:30.897
Come what may."

1:22:33.949 --> 1:22:35.780
Now look at this.

1:22:37.035 --> 1:22:41.278
Look at my things, sitting up
on the back of that damn truck.

1:22:42.833 --> 1:22:44.198
And look at me.

1:22:44.334 --> 1:22:50.955
Getting moved on like a vagrant turned
out of a boxcar by a railroad dick.

1:22:54.178 --> 1:22:55.543
Is that what god is?

1:22:55.679 --> 1:22:59.137
Just a big old railroad dick?

1:22:59.349 --> 1:23:00.869
Who'd like to whop you
upside your head

1:23:01.018 --> 1:23:05.808
if you don't step as lively
as he wants you to step?

1:23:07.316 --> 1:23:09.602
Oh, Jesus!

1:23:14.615 --> 1:23:16.401
Oh, Nick.

1:23:19.453 --> 1:23:23.571
You guys coming? Daylight's wasting.

1:23:32.216 --> 1:23:34.047
Come on, Nick.

1:23:36.553 --> 1:23:38.885
Ralph's waiting.

1:23:58.408 --> 1:24:00.114
All right.

1:24:00.744 --> 1:24:02.450
Brad: Let's go. Susan: Let's go.

1:24:10.504 --> 1:24:12.040
Ralph: Yeehaw!

1:24:12.172 --> 1:24:15.630
Boulder, here we come! Yeehaw!

1:25:41.219 --> 1:25:43.585
Cibola!

1:25:49.686 --> 1:25:53.850
My life for you.

1:26:00.030 --> 1:26:03.147
Aah! Cibola! Aah!

1:26:03.659 --> 1:26:06.196
Wonderful city of gold!

1:26:06.870 --> 1:26:11.034
Bumpty-bump! My life for you.

1:26:18.382 --> 1:26:20.088
Hey.

1:26:21.551 --> 1:26:23.587
Hey!

1:26:25.514 --> 1:26:27.470
Anybody here?

1:26:57.504 --> 1:26:59.040
Barry:
What are we gonna do with him?

1:26:59.172 --> 1:27:03.006
- Let him sleep. Flagg wants him.
- Where is flagg, anyway?

1:27:04.136 --> 1:27:06.343
You that anxious to see him, Barry?

1:27:07.347 --> 1:27:10.214
Barry:
I just, uh... I just thought...

1:27:10.851 --> 1:27:13.593
Flagg will be around.
He's been waiting for this guy.

1:27:14.146 --> 1:27:16.353
This guy's something special.

1:27:16.773 --> 1:27:19.059
My life for you.

1:27:28.952 --> 1:27:30.192
Abagail: Thank you, lord,

1:27:31.246 --> 1:27:33.487
for bringing us across the prairie.

1:27:33.665 --> 1:27:37.783
Into this place
where the mountains begin.

1:27:37.961 --> 1:27:42.830
Please take care of us
in the days and weeks to come.

1:27:43.508 --> 1:27:47.797
And help us to love one another
and do your will,

1:27:47.929 --> 1:27:52.218
however hard
it may sometimes seem to us.

1:27:57.397 --> 1:28:00.810
Tom! Tommy, come look!

1:28:02.152 --> 1:28:03.267
Tom: What is it, Gina?

1:28:03.445 --> 1:28:06.528
A parade. Come on up and look.

1:28:09.868 --> 1:28:11.358
Gosh, it is!

1:28:20.378 --> 1:28:24.087
M-o-0o-n, that spells parade.

1:28:38.146 --> 1:28:41.183
Help us to be true, dear lord.

1:28:41.691 --> 1:28:45.058
Help us to stand.
