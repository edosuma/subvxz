00:00.134 --> 00:02.301
Previously on Dominion...

00:02.335 --> 00:04.736
Sleeping with an angel
will make you a pariah.

00:04.771 --> 00:06.204
I was thinking,

00:06.239 --> 00:08.473
"What if we understood the archangel more?"

00:08.508 --> 00:09.775
I would like reports

00:09.809 --> 00:11.743
on your findings as you receive them.

00:11.778 --> 00:14.313
Edward, I know you go outside
the city walls every few weeks.

00:14.347 --> 00:16.915
- Why?
- I've missed you.

00:18.451 --> 00:19.818
What is it you're not telling me?

00:19.852 --> 00:21.386
I'm sick, Claire.

00:21.421 --> 00:24.323
Join me as we prepare our newest member,

00:24.357 --> 00:26.094
Brother Paul.

00:29.765 --> 00:31.465
I've made a deal with my father.

00:31.500 --> 00:33.968
He's gonna stop detaining innocent people

00:34.002 --> 00:35.570
and draw up a basic bill of rights

00:35.604 --> 00:38.139
for every man, woman, and child in Vega.

00:38.173 --> 00:41.742
How did you manage that?

00:41.777 --> 00:44.011
- I agreed to marry you.
- Alex, I can help you.

00:44.046 --> 00:46.747
I can teach you, but
only if you're willing.

00:46.782 --> 00:49.951
I want to learn about everything.

01:36.064 --> 01:38.566
Is that all you've got?

01:57.619 --> 02:01.689
- You failed.
- No, I got this.

02:01.723 --> 02:02.990
Let's go again.

02:03.024 --> 02:05.826
- The lesson is over, Alex.
- Yeah? Is it?

02:05.861 --> 02:08.529
Because we've been out here all day.

02:08.562 --> 02:11.398
I still don't know what it
is you're trying to teach me.

02:11.433 --> 02:13.234
I know how to shoot.

02:13.268 --> 02:17.505
So how do you explain this?

02:17.539 --> 02:19.006
I went easy on you.

02:19.040 --> 02:20.708
What did you expect? You gave me live ammo.

02:20.742 --> 02:22.409
'Cause I was certain you'd have no chance

02:22.444 --> 02:23.844
of hitting me.

02:23.879 --> 02:25.346
You're a soldier.

02:25.380 --> 02:27.114
You've spent years honing your skills,

02:27.148 --> 02:28.949
and in just a few hours,
I made you forget them all

02:28.984 --> 02:30.885
simply by provoking you.

02:30.919 --> 02:32.620
That is bullshit.

02:32.654 --> 02:34.955
Each time I attacked you,
I used the sun to blind you,

02:34.990 --> 02:36.590
but you kept firing.

02:36.625 --> 02:38.859
Your instincts were screaming at you.

02:38.894 --> 02:41.962
You didn't listen to them.

02:41.997 --> 02:43.964
Look.

02:45.867 --> 02:47.868
My shadow.

02:47.903 --> 02:49.303
If you weren't so busy
squinting at the sun,

02:49.337 --> 02:50.771
you could have used my shadow to track me

02:50.805 --> 02:54.241
for any number of counter-maneuvers.

02:54.276 --> 02:55.876
I know what I'm doing.

02:55.911 --> 02:57.378
If you knew what you were doing,

02:57.412 --> 02:58.946
that little girl would still be alive.

02:58.980 --> 03:01.315
Hey! Bixby.

03:01.349 --> 03:04.018
Her name was Bixby.

03:04.052 --> 03:06.720
You're desperate to avenge
those who've been taken

03:06.755 --> 03:09.056
from you, but desperation
will only get others killed.

03:09.090 --> 03:11.992
You must learn to control your emotions,

03:12.027 --> 03:15.396
or they will be the end of you.

03:15.430 --> 03:18.032
Watch the shadows, not the sun.

- Shh...

Our father, who art in heaven...

03:52.000 --> 03:55.169
Shh.

03:55.203 --> 03:56.604
Shh...

03:56.638 --> 03:58.305
David.

03:58.340 --> 04:00.107
Shh... Shh.

04:05.547 --> 04:07.047
Make him stop.

04:07.082 --> 04:08.449
They'll hear us.

04:10.552 --> 04:12.953
William. Shh, shh, shh!

04:12.988 --> 04:15.256
Shh...

04:37.679 --> 04:39.747
Get off her, you... bitch.

04:44.419 --> 04:46.887
Ugh!

04:53.461 --> 04:55.296
Mommy!

04:55.330 --> 04:56.897
Peggy!

04:56.932 --> 04:59.733
Charles...

04:59.768 --> 05:00.968
Dad?

05:01.002 --> 05:03.804
Mom. I want mom.

05:03.838 --> 05:05.639
William.

05:05.674 --> 05:07.908
Mom. Mama.

05:09.878 --> 05:12.146
Father?

05:12.180 --> 05:13.681
Father?

05:15.083 --> 05:17.084
Sorry. What?

05:17.118 --> 05:20.554
I was just asking if you'd
like to say a few words...

05:20.589 --> 05:22.723
at the engagement party.

05:29.130 --> 05:34.635
There must be some fatherly
advice you'd like to share.

05:34.669 --> 05:37.538
We're survivors, William.

05:37.572 --> 05:40.074
We're not immortal.

05:42.410 --> 05:44.979
Cherish your time together.

05:59.861 --> 06:01.629
Alex...

06:04.633 --> 06:06.166
What happened?

06:10.639 --> 06:14.375
Michael's life lessons.

06:27.389 --> 06:31.025
Did you... scatter Bixby's ashes?

06:34.162 --> 06:37.598
In the garden under a jacaranda tree.

06:37.632 --> 06:41.368
In the spring, it's gonna
be full of purple flowers.

06:44.205 --> 06:45.806
I thought she was gonna make it through.

06:45.840 --> 06:47.508
Yeah, we all did.

06:47.542 --> 06:52.513
The doctor said her injuries
were just too severe.

07:06.661 --> 07:08.595
I'm sorry.

07:12.000 --> 07:14.068
I can't.

07:23.211 --> 07:26.046
You're gonna marry William,

07:26.081 --> 07:27.981
aren't you?

07:30.452 --> 07:32.953
- It's the right thing to do.
- Mm.

07:36.624 --> 07:38.892
Get engaged to someone you don't love?

07:38.927 --> 07:41.929
Alex, I had a choice to make.

07:45.300 --> 07:47.534
I need to look out for the city.

07:55.944 --> 08:02.116
Claire.

08:02.150 --> 08:03.984
Oh, Claire.

08:09.724 --> 08:12.025
Stop.

08:12.060 --> 08:14.161
I'm sorry.

08:32.013 --> 08:34.081
Miss Riesen?

08:36.851 --> 08:39.820
Are you okay?

08:39.854 --> 08:41.789
Yeah.

08:41.823 --> 08:43.090
Uh...

08:43.124 --> 08:45.759
Yeah, I'm fine.

08:45.794 --> 08:47.294
I was...

08:47.328 --> 08:49.797
It's just all this lace

08:49.831 --> 08:54.201
and silk and a dress
train a mile long. I j...

08:54.235 --> 08:56.136
It's all too much.

08:58.039 --> 09:00.941
But your wedding is all that
the lower VS can talk about.

09:00.975 --> 09:02.342
I'm sure.

09:02.377 --> 09:04.578
"The Princess and the Principate."

09:04.612 --> 09:07.948
Yeah, exactly what the senate wants

09:07.982 --> 09:09.783
to take people's minds
off their own problems,

09:09.818 --> 09:11.485
a grand old wedding.

09:11.519 --> 09:13.020
Yeah.

09:13.054 --> 09:16.657
It's like a real-life fairy tale.

09:16.691 --> 09:17.958
Yes.

09:17.992 --> 09:20.427
Yes, it is. We are very happy.

09:20.461 --> 09:22.529
It's a match made in heaven...

09:22.564 --> 09:24.598
back in the day when an eight-ball

09:24.632 --> 09:29.136
was something just to be
avoided on the pool table.

09:30.538 --> 09:33.440
Consul. How are you feeling?

09:33.474 --> 09:35.209
Please call me David.

09:35.243 --> 09:37.277
We're gonna be family.

09:41.082 --> 09:42.950
Wedding present.

09:42.984 --> 09:45.819
It's early, I know, but, uh,

09:45.854 --> 09:47.521
I heard that a young bride

09:47.555 --> 09:50.691
is in need of something borrowed.

09:50.725 --> 09:52.492
Thank you.

09:55.563 --> 09:56.997
It was my wife's.

09:57.031 --> 09:59.066
She wore it on our wedding day.

09:59.100 --> 10:00.767
I really don't know what to say.

10:00.802 --> 10:03.470
No... it's nothing.

10:03.504 --> 10:06.473
Thank you.

10:06.507 --> 10:08.876
- It's beautiful.
- How's your dad?

10:08.910 --> 10:10.043
I heard about his heart. I'm sorry.

10:10.078 --> 10:11.678
You have my sympathies.

10:11.713 --> 10:13.247
Oh, well, you know, they're not necessary.

10:13.281 --> 10:16.850
He's fine. He's stubborn as an ox.

10:16.885 --> 10:19.920
Yeah, an inspiration to us all.

10:19.954 --> 10:22.556
Yeah, more fight in him than most

10:22.590 --> 10:27.828
but, um, there are some
who have their concerns.

10:27.862 --> 10:29.863
Who?

10:29.898 --> 10:33.433
No one knows about his heart, so...

10:33.468 --> 10:36.436
Unless you've said something to someone.

10:36.471 --> 10:41.375
Somehow Senator Romero has sussed it out,

10:41.409 --> 10:43.543
and you know her. She's
like a dog with a bone.

10:43.578 --> 10:45.913
She's pushing for a vote of
"No Confidence" in the senate

10:45.947 --> 10:51.385
to force him to relinquish his seat.

10:52.954 --> 10:55.522
How can she do that?

10:55.556 --> 10:58.125
Putting our fondness for your dad aside,

10:58.159 --> 11:01.895
you must admit that she has a point.

11:01.930 --> 11:05.198
How prudent would it be to
place the future of our city

11:05.233 --> 11:07.935
in the hands of a dying man?

11:07.969 --> 11:09.636
You're gonna support her vote, aren't you?

11:09.671 --> 11:11.872
It might be what's best for Vega.

11:11.906 --> 11:13.440
No. What's best for Vega

11:13.474 --> 11:16.476
is a strong leader like my father.

11:16.511 --> 11:18.412
Yeah, well, we'll have one in you.

11:18.446 --> 11:19.646
Me?

11:19.681 --> 11:22.649
I heard how you handled that whole ordeal

11:22.684 --> 11:24.504
with Senator Frost.

11:24.539 --> 11:26.886
Decisive, unflinching,
but most importantly,

11:26.921 --> 11:32.759
you got the two of us out
of there relatively unharmed.

11:32.794 --> 11:35.095
I'm confident you're ready.

11:35.129 --> 11:36.830
Come on, the people worship you, Claire.

11:36.864 --> 11:40.100
They believe everything you say.

11:40.134 --> 11:42.436
Why are you telling me this?

11:43.871 --> 11:47.574
Because you may be Lady of the City

11:47.608 --> 11:51.411
sooner than you expect.

11:51.446 --> 11:53.680
Best be prepared, huh?

11:56.985 --> 11:59.252
The marketplace is now open

11:59.287 --> 12:00.988
for all V-designated...

12:41.429 --> 12:43.663
Hello there.

12:48.836 --> 12:51.738
That'll be $10.50.

12:56.277 --> 12:58.211
Please don't say anything.

13:11.292 --> 13:13.693
When you were in prison,

13:13.728 --> 13:16.963
your markings spoke to
you in a form of a vision.

13:16.998 --> 13:18.631
Why then?

13:18.666 --> 13:20.767
Because you were cut off from the world,

13:20.801 --> 13:23.436
from chaos and distraction.

13:23.471 --> 13:26.573
You were forced to focus.

13:30.511 --> 13:32.812
Close your eyes.

13:35.316 --> 13:38.351
Okay, now what?

13:38.386 --> 13:40.320
Breathe.

13:42.023 --> 13:43.623
I'm breathing. Nothing's happening.

13:43.657 --> 13:46.960
It might help if you stop talking.

13:46.994 --> 13:49.629
Now...

13:49.663 --> 13:51.831
listen.

14:04.745 --> 14:06.012
Alex.

14:10.518 --> 14:12.519
Alex.

14:13.954 --> 14:15.989
Bix.

14:16.023 --> 14:18.425
Don't let them hurt anyone else.

14:22.129 --> 14:23.363
Alex.

14:29.937 --> 14:32.338
What happened?

14:32.373 --> 14:34.007
- Where'd I go?
- Nowhere.

14:34.041 --> 14:36.209
We've been here for hours.

14:36.243 --> 14:38.878
What did you see?

14:38.913 --> 14:43.283
Alex, what did you see?

14:43.317 --> 14:45.151
Who I'm fighting for.

14:54.128 --> 14:56.262
I had one of the wall
guards pick them for me

14:56.297 --> 14:58.465
in exchange for a night off.

14:58.499 --> 15:00.700
I wish that I knew you were coming by.

15:00.734 --> 15:02.902
Well, then it wouldn't
have been a surprise,

15:02.937 --> 15:04.771
now would it?

15:07.308 --> 15:09.375
What's this? This is new.

15:09.410 --> 15:11.544
No, I've always had that.

15:11.579 --> 15:14.547
No, no, I would recognize that.

15:14.582 --> 15:16.916
Have you been outside the hotel?

15:16.951 --> 15:19.786
I just went to the market.

15:19.820 --> 15:22.122
Inside Vega? How?

15:22.156 --> 15:25.158
The tunnels that you
use to come and see me.

15:25.192 --> 15:28.161
I know that I promised, but
I just needed some things.

15:28.195 --> 15:31.297
- Did anyone see you?
- No.

15:31.332 --> 15:34.134
All these years I've been
a very good girl, haven't I?

15:34.168 --> 15:35.969
When you're gone, how long is it gonna be

15:36.003 --> 15:38.304
until I run out of food or water?

15:38.339 --> 15:41.207
I need someone to take care of me.

15:44.011 --> 15:45.912
What about your daughter?

15:45.946 --> 15:47.413
Everything that you've
told me about Claire,

15:47.448 --> 15:49.782
how kind, how caring she is,

15:49.817 --> 15:52.118
how she helps the V-1 children...

15:52.153 --> 15:53.953
Maybe she could help me.

15:53.988 --> 15:56.189
No, that's not possible.

15:58.225 --> 16:01.694
You're so wise, General...

16:01.729 --> 16:05.431
but you didn't think
about all of this, did you?

16:05.466 --> 16:09.202
Or did you just expect me
to die of a broken heart?

16:09.236 --> 16:11.638
That would be so much
easier for you, wouldn't it?

16:11.672 --> 16:14.541
- You know that's not true.
- Well, what am I gonna do?

16:14.575 --> 16:18.511
My kind won't take me back.
They'd smell you on me,

16:18.546 --> 16:21.214
and your kind would shoot me on the spot.

16:21.248 --> 16:24.651
You made me believe
that I was someone else,

16:24.685 --> 16:27.353
someone that I could never be,

16:27.388 --> 16:30.323
and now there's nowhere for me to go.

16:32.393 --> 16:35.762
I'll think of something. I will.

16:42.670 --> 16:44.971
You knew, huh?

16:45.005 --> 16:48.541
About the general's bad ticker?

16:48.576 --> 16:51.377
You knew, but you didn't tell me.

16:51.412 --> 16:53.713
I promised to give you
information on Michael.

16:53.747 --> 16:55.548
This wasn't relevant.

16:55.583 --> 16:58.418
Oh, well, then perhaps
we should add a clause

16:58.452 --> 17:00.653
to our little agreement.

17:00.688 --> 17:02.488
Well, no matter.

17:02.523 --> 17:05.325
Everyone's gonna know
about Riesen soon enough,

17:05.358 --> 17:08.928
once we've tossed him out of office.

17:08.963 --> 17:10.663
By the way, I need your support on that.

17:10.698 --> 17:13.031
Please,

17:13.067 --> 17:14.701
you know I'd never support that.

17:14.734 --> 17:16.836
Yeah, I do, but I thought
you might reconsider.

17:16.869 --> 17:18.238
You don't want everyone knowing about

17:18.271 --> 17:20.106
your little fling with Michael.

17:20.140 --> 17:22.342
Fallen angel, indeed.

17:22.376 --> 17:23.843
No, that's not gonna work.

17:23.877 --> 17:25.545
You already tried that threat once.

17:25.579 --> 17:28.381
But there's a cherry on top.

17:28.415 --> 17:30.083
Four of them, actually...

17:30.117 --> 17:33.920
Emily, Gloria, and Hannah

17:33.954 --> 17:38.358
and, uh,
vuh-vuh-Veronica...

17:38.392 --> 17:41.894
though I suppose they're
not really cherries anymore.

17:41.929 --> 17:44.030
Hmm.

17:44.064 --> 17:46.799
Good old-fashioned orgy, huh?

17:46.834 --> 17:51.137
Who knew Michael was
such a love machine, huh?

17:52.640 --> 17:56.075
Shame you couldn't satisfy his appetite.

17:58.279 --> 18:00.246
But let me tell you this.

18:00.281 --> 18:04.217
If you don't want your little harem

18:04.251 --> 18:06.753
paraded out in front of the senate...

18:06.787 --> 18:09.889
'cause they'd love to testify...

18:09.923 --> 18:13.993
you will do exactly what I tell you.

18:22.135 --> 18:24.702
So to you newcomers of the church,

18:24.736 --> 18:26.337
what I'll repeat is this...

18:26.371 --> 18:32.343
Our trust, offered to a savior.

18:32.377 --> 18:34.812
Our devotion,

18:34.846 --> 18:39.684
a sacred vow we promise.

18:39.718 --> 18:42.653
Our secret prayers

18:42.688 --> 18:47.525
shared in his confidence.

18:58.170 --> 19:01.906
May the chosen one protect you all.

19:01.940 --> 19:05.543
May the chosen one protect us all.

19:05.577 --> 19:06.911
Thank you.

19:11.717 --> 19:15.186
Thank you. That's very kind of you.

19:16.655 --> 19:18.923
How could you preach this heresy?

19:18.957 --> 19:21.959
I thought I told you never
to approach me in public.

19:21.994 --> 19:24.128
Get out of here.

19:27.299 --> 19:28.766
All this talk about vows...

19:28.800 --> 19:30.835
Have you forgotten your own to Gabriel?

19:30.869 --> 19:33.204
This is...

19:33.238 --> 19:34.438
my vow to Gabriel,

19:34.473 --> 19:36.841
to be his eyes and ears in Vega...

19:36.875 --> 19:38.509
And you're putting

19:38.543 --> 19:40.478
all of us in danger.

19:40.512 --> 19:43.714
If you ever dare question me again...

19:43.749 --> 19:45.850
William?

19:45.884 --> 19:47.251
Go.

19:49.488 --> 19:50.521
Claire.

19:50.555 --> 19:53.224
What a pleasant surprise.

19:53.258 --> 19:55.793
Yeah. So who was that?

19:55.827 --> 19:59.530
Just some poor, ragged
soul questioning his faith.

19:59.564 --> 20:01.899
I was just about to come and find you.

20:01.933 --> 20:03.734
I'm sorry to hear about
your father, his heart.

20:03.769 --> 20:05.136
I had no idea.

20:05.170 --> 20:07.371
Yeah, actually, that's...

20:07.406 --> 20:10.274
that's why I wanted to
come and talk to you.

20:13.745 --> 20:18.382
There are people who are
trying to use his condition

20:18.417 --> 20:22.086
against him to make him step
down as Lord of the City.

20:22.120 --> 20:23.988
Of course.

20:24.022 --> 20:28.559
I guess I wished it would be beneath him.

20:28.593 --> 20:30.861
- I'm sorry.
- No, you don't have to be.

20:32.764 --> 20:37.435
I need to convince your father
to stop doing what he's doing.

20:45.377 --> 20:47.278
Is there anything that you can tell me

20:47.312 --> 20:49.747
about your dad

20:49.781 --> 20:52.750
that might help me?

20:54.486 --> 20:56.420
Are you trying to blackmail my father?

20:56.455 --> 20:57.455
No.

21:03.662 --> 21:06.464
Yes.

21:06.498 --> 21:09.133
I'm sorry, uh...

21:09.167 --> 21:12.169
- You must think I'm horrible.
- No, no, I don't.

21:13.505 --> 21:15.473
I think you're a good daughter.

21:15.507 --> 21:19.410
Look, I'll go home and talk to
him tonight before the party.

21:19.444 --> 21:22.913
I'll tell him to back off.

21:22.948 --> 21:26.517
I can be pretty convincing
when I want to be.

22:09.795 --> 22:20.273
Michael.

22:20.307 --> 22:22.875
That's not why I'm here.

22:31.018 --> 22:35.722
You said that I should go find a good man,

22:35.756 --> 22:39.492
a man that I could have a normal life with,

22:39.526 --> 22:42.161
and what we have together has to end.

22:44.331 --> 22:46.699
Well, you were right.

22:46.734 --> 22:48.234
Yes.

22:50.771 --> 22:52.905
I can't see you anymore.

22:54.241 --> 22:55.908
It's for the best.

23:00.347 --> 23:03.516
Is that all you have to say?

23:03.550 --> 23:05.885
I don't know what you mean.

23:08.555 --> 23:10.256
Good-bye, Michael.

23:28.140 --> 23:30.441
Hey.

23:30.475 --> 23:32.510
Got any lipstick?

23:32.544 --> 23:34.211
For who?

23:34.246 --> 23:36.047
Who do you think?

23:38.250 --> 23:39.584
Autumn breeze.

23:39.618 --> 23:40.818
Goes with your eyes.

23:42.120 --> 23:44.855
Uh, I don't think so.

23:44.890 --> 23:46.924
Alex.

23:46.959 --> 23:48.726
Hey, are you okay?

23:48.760 --> 23:50.428
Fine.

23:50.462 --> 23:52.730
Yeah? You don't look fine.

23:52.764 --> 23:57.301
Hey, it's about Bixby, isn't it?

23:57.336 --> 23:58.769
Alex.

23:58.804 --> 24:02.139
- Alex, I'm sorry.
- Noma, leave it alone.

24:02.174 --> 24:04.609
What are you guys doing?
There was an eight-ball attack

24:04.643 --> 24:07.612
in the city yesterday... A shopkeeper.

24:07.646 --> 24:09.880
Found his body in a garbage bag.

24:09.915 --> 24:12.049
Yeah, I heard his head
was found facing his back.

24:12.084 --> 24:14.418
Yeah, and the troops just
went out to search for it.

24:14.453 --> 24:15.820
They got this.

24:15.854 --> 24:17.388
They're gonna need our help.

24:17.422 --> 24:20.224
I'm not gonna sit around if
an angel's inside the walls,

24:20.258 --> 24:21.425
waiting for it to kill again.

24:21.460 --> 24:23.127
I'm not sure it's a good idea

24:23.161 --> 24:26.130
for you to go out in
this state of mind, Alex.

24:55.027 --> 24:56.527
Claire?

24:58.296 --> 24:59.664
Edward, I...

24:59.698 --> 25:01.499
Get out of Claire's room!

25:01.533 --> 25:03.167
I know that you're angry,

25:03.201 --> 25:04.935
but I wanted to leave her a gift,

25:04.970 --> 25:08.005
- just a little gift.
- Not another word.

25:08.040 --> 25:09.807
You murdered that man in the market.

25:09.841 --> 25:11.542
He was going to kill me.

25:11.576 --> 25:14.145
You stay away from my daughter.

25:14.179 --> 25:17.982
You don't have long, my love,

25:18.016 --> 25:20.151
and when you're dead,

25:20.185 --> 25:23.020
no one can stop me from coming back here.

26:26.465 --> 26:30.201
I thought that this day
might come eventually.

26:32.738 --> 26:35.339
W-what day?

26:35.374 --> 26:38.109
The day when you ask me advice

26:38.143 --> 26:40.277
about your wedding night.

26:42.247 --> 26:45.149
On how to tame your little filly.

26:45.183 --> 26:48.519
Better have a drink.

26:52.424 --> 26:56.060
I came to talk about General Riesen.

26:56.094 --> 26:58.863
Yeah?

26:58.897 --> 27:01.665
Bullying him out of office.

27:01.700 --> 27:03.701
Is that really necessary?

27:06.705 --> 27:10.074
Necessary? No.

27:10.108 --> 27:13.010
Expedient? Yes.

27:13.044 --> 27:14.912
Opportunity knocks, William.

27:14.946 --> 27:17.815
The man's dying,

27:17.849 --> 27:19.517
and it won't be long before Claire and I

27:19.551 --> 27:23.487
control this city just like you want.

27:23.522 --> 27:25.189
She's finally starting to warm up.

27:25.223 --> 27:27.391
She trusts me.

27:27.426 --> 27:29.760
I'm doing what's best for Vega.

27:29.795 --> 27:33.063
Don't talk to me like I'm the senate.

27:33.098 --> 27:37.701
You're doing what's best
for yourself and no one else,

27:37.736 --> 27:39.904
especially not me.

27:39.938 --> 27:43.507
I'm doing what's best for the family,

27:43.542 --> 27:45.910
our family...

27:45.944 --> 27:48.779
what's left of it, anyway.

27:48.814 --> 27:52.616
Who the hell do you think you are...

27:52.651 --> 27:54.084
telling me how to do my job?

27:54.119 --> 27:55.286
That isn't what I mean.

27:55.320 --> 27:57.354
- What I...
- Yes, it is.

27:57.389 --> 27:59.457
You think you could do better?

27:59.491 --> 28:01.792
Well, let me tell you something, sonny.

28:01.827 --> 28:04.028
When you're made Lord of the City,

28:04.062 --> 28:06.063
you're gonna need my help.

28:06.097 --> 28:09.033
You're gonna need me to
hold your hand all the way

28:09.067 --> 28:11.969
just like you always have.

28:12.003 --> 28:15.873
You know it, I know it,

28:15.907 --> 28:20.144
and Claire knows it.

28:20.178 --> 28:22.246
Warming up?

28:22.280 --> 28:24.548
Please.

28:24.583 --> 28:26.717
She's playing you like a fiddle.

28:26.751 --> 28:29.086
You are nothing without me.

28:31.189 --> 28:33.023
You're wrong.

28:36.628 --> 28:38.629
What I sacrificed for you

28:38.663 --> 28:41.866
would make your blood run cold...

28:41.900 --> 28:43.601
if you had any.

28:43.635 --> 28:46.403
You owe me, boy.

28:46.438 --> 28:49.373
Just how much, you'll never know.

28:58.950 --> 29:04.388
I am the man I am because of you, father.

29:11.997 --> 29:14.298
They still haven't found the eight-ball.

29:14.332 --> 29:15.933
It's time I join the hunt.

29:15.967 --> 29:20.437
I want you to cancel the search right now.

29:20.472 --> 29:22.139
What?

29:22.173 --> 29:23.807
Tell them it's a false alarm.

29:23.842 --> 29:26.043
I need you to handle this yourself.

29:26.077 --> 29:27.645
It's classified.

29:27.679 --> 29:30.214
Nobody in the city can
know, not even the senate.

29:30.248 --> 29:31.715
I don't want there to be panic,

29:31.750 --> 29:33.684
especially not tonight.

29:36.922 --> 29:40.457
She must mean a great deal to you.

29:40.492 --> 29:42.593
You knew.

29:43.962 --> 29:48.032
More of what goes on in
this city than you'd imagine.

29:51.570 --> 29:54.038
What must you think?

29:57.375 --> 30:00.311
You love her.

30:00.345 --> 30:01.979
I did once.

30:02.013 --> 30:05.082
Now...

30:05.116 --> 30:07.418
It's all my own doing.

30:07.452 --> 30:09.353
I'll capture her safely.

30:09.387 --> 30:12.389
No, no, look, this... this needs to end.

30:16.027 --> 30:18.362
I need her taken down.

30:18.396 --> 30:20.564
But you said you loved her.

30:27.472 --> 30:30.274
Please, don't let her suffer.

30:39.884 --> 30:42.319
Attention... Citywide curfew

30:42.354 --> 30:44.088
now in effect.

30:44.122 --> 30:47.424
Repeat... Citywide curfew is now in effect.

30:47.459 --> 30:49.393
Miss?

30:49.427 --> 30:51.595
Are you all right?

30:51.630 --> 30:55.566
Go away. Please go away.

30:55.600 --> 30:58.736
Alex, you heard the radio.
They called off the search.

30:58.770 --> 31:01.839
- Let's go grab a beer.
- Noma, someone was killed.

31:03.808 --> 31:06.276
Look, Alex, it's like
a wall's up around you,

31:06.310 --> 31:07.311
and I'm on the outside.

31:07.345 --> 31:09.079
- What aren't you telling me?
- Nothing.

31:09.113 --> 31:10.714
- Nothing.
- You know what?

31:10.748 --> 31:12.449
It's not like you haven't
shut me out before.

31:12.484 --> 31:14.518
- Yeah, not like this.
- Oh, yeah, you have.

31:14.552 --> 31:17.521
Week after you came back
from the desert, during basic?

31:17.555 --> 31:18.956
Alex, you don't want to go there.

31:18.990 --> 31:21.558
You went away for maneuvers. You came back.

31:21.593 --> 31:23.260
All of a sudden, I was a stranger.

31:23.294 --> 31:25.062
Forget I ever brought it up, okay?

31:25.096 --> 31:27.264
You know, I still don't
know what the hell happened.

31:27.298 --> 31:28.699
Attention.

31:28.733 --> 31:31.235
Citywide curfew is now in effect.

31:31.269 --> 31:34.905
Repeat... Citywide curfew is now in effect.

31:34.939 --> 31:39.109
Finch found out about us, okay?

31:39.144 --> 31:43.147
Someone blabbed. I don't know who.

31:43.181 --> 31:45.449
He was gonna toss you from the Corps,

31:45.483 --> 31:48.385
and I couldn't let that happen.

31:52.724 --> 31:55.192
Why didn't you tell me?

31:55.226 --> 31:57.594
The Corps was the only family that you had.

31:57.629 --> 32:00.931
I couldn't let you lose it because of me,

32:00.965 --> 32:03.600
so I told Finch that I'd end it,

32:03.635 --> 32:05.469
and I did.

32:11.876 --> 32:13.977
You thought the Corps
was more important to me

32:14.012 --> 32:15.979
than you?

32:17.582 --> 32:19.383
You met Claire right after,

32:19.417 --> 32:22.953
so... it all worked out.

32:22.987 --> 32:24.354
We've got a report

32:24.389 --> 32:26.890
on a body in sector 22. Anyone local?

32:26.925 --> 32:29.326
Lannon, just east of there.

32:29.360 --> 32:31.428
We'll check it out.

32:31.463 --> 32:33.230
Copy that.

32:45.543 --> 32:46.877
Alex.

32:57.388 --> 32:59.690
That's Richardson.

33:01.960 --> 33:04.128
It's still inside these walls.

33:06.217 --> 33:08.650
My mom used to have them.

33:08.685 --> 33:12.287
Really sweet smell,
very much like tuberoses.

33:12.322 --> 33:13.822
Yeah, it's really nice.

33:16.459 --> 33:18.360
But why didn't she want to meet up

33:18.394 --> 33:20.629
in the Stratosphere as usual?

33:20.663 --> 33:22.631
Because, Emily, you're
no longer welcome there.

33:22.665 --> 33:24.099
You all have to leave Vega.

33:24.133 --> 33:26.335
I'm arranging your transport to Helena.

33:26.369 --> 33:27.703
What? Why?

33:27.737 --> 33:30.105
Our nights with the archangel are over.

33:30.139 --> 33:32.040
And if anyone should ever ask you,

33:32.075 --> 33:33.475
they never happened.

33:39.282 --> 33:41.884
William, I'm jealous!

33:44.587 --> 33:47.222
It's an engagement party, General.

33:47.257 --> 33:49.291
What is with the high security?

33:49.325 --> 33:50.792
Need I remind you we're at war?

33:50.827 --> 33:53.662
- No.
- They're here to make sure

33:53.696 --> 33:55.831
that doesn't spoil a momentous evening.

33:55.865 --> 33:57.466
Welcome, William. Congratulations.

33:57.500 --> 33:59.368
Thank you, General. Where's Claire?

33:59.402 --> 34:01.136
Yeah, where is the blushing bride?

34:01.170 --> 34:02.838
Hello?

34:10.880 --> 34:12.880
I'm sorry, Miss Riesen, but...

34:12.916 --> 34:15.317
there's a rumor Consul
Whele turned one of his maids

34:15.351 --> 34:17.351
into lion chow for stealing his silverware.

34:17.387 --> 34:18.887
Don't worry.

34:18.922 --> 34:20.722
No one's turning you
into lion chow just yet.

34:20.757 --> 34:22.591
I'm not stealing silver.

34:25.527 --> 34:27.596
William left his speech up here somewhere,

34:27.630 --> 34:29.797
so, you know, I said I'd get it for him.

34:33.603 --> 34:36.004
You sure you don't want
me to take care of this?

34:36.039 --> 34:37.940
You're gonna miss your party.

34:37.974 --> 34:42.043
Those little tiny snacks,
usually better than the entrée.

34:43.545 --> 34:46.335
Probably almost all gone by now.

34:52.335 --> 34:56.036
_

35:35.820 --> 35:37.521
Thank you.

35:40.358 --> 35:42.826
- Where have you been?
- I'm sorry I'm late.

35:42.860 --> 35:45.462
I had to rush across town to fix my dress.

35:45.496 --> 35:47.164
Don't be angry.

35:48.733 --> 35:50.734
Everything is gonna be okay now, dad.

35:53.363 --> 35:56.632
An engagement party without the bride.

35:56.667 --> 35:57.833
We missed you.

35:57.868 --> 35:59.835
Some entrance, Lady Riesen.

36:01.138 --> 36:02.338
Everyone, this way.

36:02.372 --> 36:04.707
Dinner is served.

36:04.741 --> 36:07.576
I'll be along in a moment. Go.

36:11.048 --> 36:13.015
Shall we, David?

36:13.050 --> 36:15.017
They say chivalry is dead.

36:16.920 --> 36:18.954
My goodness, it truly shines.

36:18.989 --> 36:20.823
Mm, yes.

36:20.857 --> 36:23.793
I'll never do it justice,
but I hope you're pleased.

36:23.827 --> 36:25.394
Very.

36:25.429 --> 36:26.996
I wanted to thank you for telling me

36:27.030 --> 36:28.898
about the senate vote and Romero.

36:28.932 --> 36:31.367
You understand there's nothing
personal against your father.

36:31.401 --> 36:33.335
- I'm just a patriot who...
- Yes, and so am I,

36:33.370 --> 36:35.971
which is why I feel the
people deserve to know

36:36.006 --> 36:38.174
that one of their trusted dignitaries,

36:38.208 --> 36:41.143
a pillar of the community, is
secretly working for Gabriel.

36:41.178 --> 36:43.212
What?

36:43.246 --> 36:44.947
You can't be serious. Who?

36:52.089 --> 36:53.255
You.

36:53.290 --> 36:56.158
Patriot, my ass.

36:56.193 --> 36:58.060
Everyone knows you're a snake.

36:58.095 --> 37:01.916
I really never thought that
you would betray your own.

37:01.951 --> 37:03.485
This isn't mine.

37:05.488 --> 37:08.356
Oh, frame me? Really?

37:08.391 --> 37:09.891
You're better than that, Claire.

37:09.925 --> 37:12.293
Oh, please, David. Nobody's framing you.

37:12.328 --> 37:13.795
I found it in your study.

37:13.829 --> 37:15.597
Nonsense. You haven't a shred of proof

37:15.631 --> 37:17.432
to put this in my home.

37:17.466 --> 37:20.802
"Happy Birthday, daddy, from
your three little ducklings."

37:20.836 --> 37:22.604
End table by the fireplace.

37:22.638 --> 37:24.606
No one is going to believe this nonsense.

37:24.640 --> 37:26.107
I'm a consul.

37:26.142 --> 37:28.543
And I'm the future Lady of the City.

37:28.577 --> 37:31.146
You said it yourself, David.

37:31.180 --> 37:35.583
The people worship me. They
believe every word I say.

37:35.618 --> 37:39.320
So if you go after my father with Romero,

37:39.355 --> 37:42.924
I swear I will expose you for
the filthy traitor that you are.

37:42.958 --> 37:45.593
You and I both know that this isn't mine.

37:45.628 --> 37:47.629
Father?

37:47.663 --> 37:49.130
You guys coming?

37:49.165 --> 37:51.666
Yes, of course.

37:51.700 --> 37:53.768
Shall we, David?

37:55.404 --> 37:57.806
I'd put it away.

38:02.233 --> 38:04.435
Attention, citywide
curfew is now in effect.

38:04.469 --> 38:07.905
Repeat... Citywide curfew...

38:07.939 --> 38:09.807
is now in effect.

38:17.780 --> 38:19.422
Did you hear that?

38:24.622 --> 38:26.356
There it is.

38:38.636 --> 38:39.837
Noma, down!

39:27.652 --> 39:29.353
Noma, cover the exit.

40:30.581 --> 40:31.682
Wait!

40:31.716 --> 40:33.784
Wait. Please?

40:33.818 --> 40:35.385
I don't want to die.

40:35.420 --> 40:37.454
You deserve to die.

40:37.488 --> 40:40.223
There's only darkness,

40:40.258 --> 40:43.427
and I'm afraid. I'm so afraid.

40:43.461 --> 40:45.862
You creatures...

40:45.897 --> 40:49.199
you've damned good people to that darkness.

40:49.233 --> 40:50.634
My friend.

40:50.668 --> 40:52.569
- My father!
- No.

40:52.603 --> 40:56.106
I didn't fight Gabriel's war.

40:56.140 --> 40:58.575
That body... That's not your body.

40:58.609 --> 41:00.978
That's some woman's, some innocent woman!

41:01.012 --> 41:02.946
You killed her.

41:02.981 --> 41:04.848
I was wrong.

41:07.118 --> 41:09.286
Please don't kill me.

41:09.320 --> 41:12.589
I have a family.

41:12.623 --> 41:14.925
I have a daughter.

41:24.869 --> 41:27.004
Claire would like to say a few words.

41:31.676 --> 41:34.177
Thank you all for being here tonight.

41:34.212 --> 41:36.747
William and I, we are
honored that you would join us

41:36.781 --> 41:38.915
to celebrate Vega's bright future,

41:38.950 --> 41:43.186
and, of course, the union of
two of its founding families.

41:43.221 --> 41:45.322
Um...

41:45.324 --> 41:51.264
There is one person who isn't
here at the table tonight,

41:51.298 --> 41:53.499
someone who I wish with all my heart

41:53.534 --> 41:56.436
could have lived to see this day.

41:56.470 --> 41:58.805
To my mother.
