00:01.454 --> 00:03.766
<i>-Will you marry me?
-Previously on "Nashville"...</i>

00:03.767 --> 00:05.192
This sudden engagement...

00:05.193 --> 00:07.552
maybe there's another reason
for your rush to the altar.

00:07.553 --> 00:09.292
Tell me, is Will gay?

00:09.293 --> 00:10.919
- What is it?
- My royalties.

00:10.920 --> 00:12.220
There's more where that came from.

00:12.221 --> 00:13.659
And that is enough for both of us.

00:13.660 --> 00:15.293
Surprise!

00:15.294 --> 00:16.359
Mama?

00:16.360 --> 00:17.577
Wha... what are you doing here?

00:17.578 --> 00:18.625
I wanted to talk about Scarlett.

00:18.626 --> 00:19.966
I just don't think she
should be on the tour.

00:19.967 --> 00:21.197
She's gonna toughen up.

00:21.198 --> 00:22.397
She wants this.

00:22.398 --> 00:23.817
Please don't make me go out there tonight.

00:23.818 --> 00:24.974
Is this about your mama?

00:24.975 --> 00:27.129
What I did was provide for you!

00:27.130 --> 00:29.238
- Something's wrong.
- Why are you doing this?

00:29.239 --> 00:30.907
- No.
- Scarlett.

00:33.000 --> 00:35.425
Come on, Scarlett. It's okay.

00:35.426 --> 00:36.700
Kill the spotlight!

00:37.317 --> 00:39.038
It's okay. It's okay.

00:39.039 --> 00:42.509
Talk to me, Scarlett. It's all right. Okay.

00:42.510 --> 00:45.408
I got you. Watch your
step. Watch your step.

00:45.409 --> 00:46.772
She's not talking.

00:46.773 --> 00:47.881
Scarlett!

00:47.882 --> 00:49.420
Somebody get the tour doc!

00:49.421 --> 00:50.475
Get Dr. Wilson!

00:51.446 --> 00:53.460
- Scarlett?
- Scarlett?

00:54.179 --> 00:55.531
Oh, this is a disaster.

00:55.532 --> 00:57.213
Crowd's getting pretty
restless. What do you want to do?

00:57.214 --> 00:58.632
Get hair and makeup up here.

00:58.633 --> 01:00.654
I'm gonna have to go up
there and start my set early.

01:00.655 --> 01:02.181
It's okay. I'm right here. I'm right here.

01:02.182 --> 01:04.436
Scarlett, my name is Dr.
Wilson. Can you hear me?

01:04.437 --> 01:06.760
Get the plane ready and make sure
the press doesn't find out about it.

01:06.761 --> 01:08.254
I don't want them
showing up at the airport.

01:08.255 --> 01:09.704
She was drinking a lot before the show.

01:09.705 --> 01:12.119
That's rarely all they've been
doing when it gets to this point.

01:12.120 --> 01:13.112
What are you doing to my daughter?!

01:13.113 --> 01:14.334
It's okay. He's a doctor.

01:14.335 --> 01:16.784
Baby, mama's here. Mama's here.

01:18.817 --> 01:20.268
You can fix her, right? You can fix her.

01:20.269 --> 01:22.912
They're on approach now,
so, you know, within 30?

01:24.265 --> 01:25.522
Okay, well, I just...

01:25.523 --> 01:26.797
what I need to do is confirm with you

01:26.798 --> 01:28.979
that the back entrance is
gonna be available to us.

01:30.406 --> 01:31.392
It is.

01:31.393 --> 01:32.847
Hey.

01:32.848 --> 01:34.482
Wasn't sure you were gonna get my message.

01:35.429 --> 01:36.510
I got it.

01:37.206 --> 01:38.377
Yeah. Okay.

01:38.378 --> 01:40.210
They're expecting us at
the clinic within the hour.

01:40.545 --> 01:41.734
Thanks, Buck.

01:42.290 --> 01:43.283
Yes.

01:44.458 --> 01:46.218
Guess it wasn't the best idea in the world

01:46.219 --> 01:48.458
for me to send her off
on tour with Juliette.

01:50.722 --> 01:52.526
You think this is Juliette's fault?

01:52.962 --> 01:54.752
No. That's not what I'm saying.

01:54.753 --> 01:56.431
I told you she couldn't handle this.

01:59.463 --> 02:01.048
I told you it would crush her.

02:01.538 --> 02:03.033
<i>You blaming me for this?</i>

02:05.619 --> 02:09.433
All I did was give her the
opportunities that she wanted.

02:10.175 --> 02:11.849
I told her she could walk away.

02:11.850 --> 02:14.085
It's your job to call the shots, all right?

02:15.039 --> 02:16.905
You're supposed to tell her what to do.

02:19.788 --> 02:21.126
One, two, three. Voilà!

02:24.979 --> 02:26.677
All right, that's a house.

02:26.678 --> 02:28.043
No.

02:28.044 --> 02:29.195
Correction...

02:30.076 --> 02:31.382
<i>that's my house.</i>

02:31.383 --> 02:32.933
You told me I should spend my money

02:32.934 --> 02:34.458
on something I've always wanted.

02:34.459 --> 02:36.464
I never thought I'd get to own a place...

02:36.465 --> 02:38.952
you know, put down
roots, feel like I belong.

02:38.953 --> 02:42.243
Now... now I do.

02:42.244 --> 02:44.774
Wow. That's great.

02:47.110 --> 02:48.960
Look, okay, it's no
pressure on us, all right?

02:48.961 --> 02:50.843
It's hard not to feel it.

02:51.519 --> 02:53.462
I want you to do whatever you want to do.

02:53.968 --> 02:55.072
I love you.

02:55.775 --> 02:57.057
<i>This is for me.</i>

02:58.723 --> 02:59.673
Well, all right.

02:59.674 --> 03:01.179
Yeah! Come on! Come on! Whoo!

03:03.002 --> 03:04.205
Avery?

03:04.206 --> 03:06.421
Hey. Don't know if you've
heard about Scarlett.

03:06.422 --> 03:07.645
No. What happened?

03:07.646 --> 03:09.005
She went out onstage last night

03:09.006 --> 03:11.013
and then just completely lost it.

03:11.471 --> 03:12.913
I had to carry her off.

03:12.914 --> 03:14.129
She's cleared, medically,

03:14.130 --> 03:16.054
but they sedated her for the flight.

03:16.055 --> 03:17.862
Rayna's waiting on the Tarmac.

03:19.717 --> 03:21.720

We should take it back to
the top of the first verse.

04:13.127 --> 04:14.823
- That was great, babe.
- Oh.

04:15.542 --> 04:16.879
I want you to meet Gina Romano.

04:16.880 --> 04:18.309
She's a reality-TV producer,

04:18.310 --> 04:19.684
and she wants to do a show about us.

04:19.685 --> 04:21.473
- Hi. Nice to meet you.
- Don't worry.

04:21.474 --> 04:23.729
No one I talk to wants to do
a reality show out the gate,

04:23.730 --> 04:26.464
but give me five minutes to
tell you what this could mean

04:26.465 --> 04:27.763
for both your careers.

04:28.172 --> 04:31.019
Yeah, sure. Give you five minutes.

04:32.147 --> 04:34.786
There's only so many things that
can cause a breakdown like this.

04:34.787 --> 04:37.103
Could be mental, could be
drugs, could be alcohol.

04:37.104 --> 04:38.920
Well, I don't want to
talk about it right now.

04:38.921 --> 04:40.208
Let's just see how she's doing.

04:40.608 --> 04:42.030
Thank you. Thank you.

04:43.595 --> 04:45.821
You're okay. Come on, now.

04:46.783 --> 04:48.961
Right here. Right here. Come
on, baby. Watch your feet.

04:48.962 --> 04:51.243
All right, babe, listen to
me. You're home, sweetie.

04:51.244 --> 04:52.246
We're gonna get you safe.

04:52.565 --> 04:54.677
We'll take good care of you, okay?

04:54.678 --> 04:55.790
Deacon.

04:56.716 --> 04:59.195
Deacon, I've got this under control, okay?

04:59.196 --> 05:00.391
Okay, Beverly.

05:00.392 --> 05:01.754
Listen, I don't need you swooping in here

05:01.755 --> 05:02.848
like some kind of white knight...

05:02.849 --> 05:04.641
- Okay.
- ...Trying to save the day.

05:04.642 --> 05:06.128
We got her checked out at Northwestern.

05:06.129 --> 05:08.058
- The doctor gave her a sedative.
- Glenn had us updated.

05:08.059 --> 05:09.328
We're gonna take her to Lakeshore crossing.

05:09.329 --> 05:10.329
It's a really great clinic.

05:10.330 --> 05:11.801
<i>I would like her to go to a real hospital.</i>

05:11.802 --> 05:13.503
This is a real hospital. She'll
get excellent medical care.

05:13.504 --> 05:14.848
We'll keep her away from the press.

05:14.849 --> 05:16.166
We're gonna do the best we can for her.

05:16.167 --> 05:17.314
Listen, why don't you ride with her?

05:17.315 --> 05:18.629
I know that'll make her feel comfortable.

05:19.403 --> 05:21.264
I've had my doctor with
her the entire time.

05:21.265 --> 05:23.392
- We've got everything under control.
- Thank you so much, doctor.

05:23.393 --> 05:25.061
I don't know what we
would've done without you.

05:25.062 --> 05:26.374
I'll ride with her to the clinic,

05:26.375 --> 05:27.426
help with the transition.

05:27.427 --> 05:28.544
Great. Thank you.

05:28.545 --> 05:30.244
Listen, my truck is right
here. I'm gonna follow behind.

05:30.245 --> 05:31.446
I'm right behind you, sweetheart.

05:31.447 --> 05:33.945
We got to go. I do not want her
in there with Beverly by herself.

05:34.891 --> 05:36.029
Whoa, hey.

05:36.030 --> 05:38.229
Uh... I guess, I'll... I'll ride with them.

05:39.550 --> 05:40.674
We'll meet you there.

05:40.675 --> 05:41.942
You know what? You've done enough.

05:41.943 --> 05:43.494
Go on home. I got it from here.

06:02.981 --> 06:04.749
We'd rig the house, but
we have a follow crew

06:04.750 --> 06:06.815
for shows, meetings, rehearsals...

06:06.816 --> 06:08.200
really paint the big picture.

06:08.201 --> 06:11.168
Look, I'm flattered, but
I've got an album to launch,

06:11.169 --> 06:13.077
national tour with Luke Wheeler, I...

06:13.078 --> 06:14.998
it sounds kind of awful, doesn't it?

06:14.999 --> 06:16.651
Cameras following you everywhere you go,

06:16.652 --> 06:17.735
always in your business.

06:17.736 --> 06:19.537
- Yeah, it kind of does.
- It's true.

06:20.059 --> 06:22.220
Reality TV can be a nightmare,

06:22.569 --> 06:25.051
unless you guys are working
with the right producers.

06:25.584 --> 06:27.513
I'm trying to put heart into it all.

06:27.514 --> 06:30.315
I'm not looking for the
"gotcha" exploitive stories.

06:30.316 --> 06:31.537
I just want the world to know

06:31.538 --> 06:33.336
how hard you have to
work to get to the top.

06:33.685 --> 06:34.891
Most of our subjects

06:34.892 --> 06:37.038
have the fringe benefits
of magazine covers,

06:37.039 --> 06:39.482
talk-show appearances, book deals.

06:39.483 --> 06:41.304
Bottom line... we never do anything

06:41.305 --> 06:42.856
that makes the two of
you feel uncomfortable.

06:43.219 --> 06:44.922
Look, I-I got to think about it.

06:44.923 --> 06:46.387
Okay, well, don't think too long.

06:46.388 --> 06:48.008
We'd hate to have to go with somebody else.

06:52.815 --> 06:55.366
You're gonna keep me informed
about absolutely everything.

06:55.367 --> 06:58.442
She's in no condition to
make any decisions on her own.

06:58.443 --> 06:59.680
- Mrs. O'Connor?
- Yeah.

06:59.681 --> 07:01.832
I'm Dr. Lau. I'll be taking
care of your daughter.

07:01.833 --> 07:02.709
Great.

07:02.710 --> 07:04.354
I know that you probably get

07:04.355 --> 07:06.252
a lot of "exhaustion" cases around here,

07:06.253 --> 07:08.568
but that's not what's
going on with Scarlett.

07:08.569 --> 07:11.387
There is family history
that you need to know about.

07:11.388 --> 07:13.680
This is obviously a psychotic break.

07:13.681 --> 07:15.321
Her grandmother had one.

07:15.322 --> 07:16.496
Anyone else?

07:17.017 --> 07:18.294
I did.

07:18.295 --> 07:19.574
I'm not ashamed of it.

07:19.575 --> 07:21.266
I got the help that I needed, and I'm...

07:23.134 --> 07:24.936
I'm a lot better than I was.

07:24.937 --> 07:26.586
Okay, we got soundcheck blocked out

07:26.587 --> 07:29.238
for all the rehearsals for
your album-launch events,

07:29.239 --> 07:30.940
and your interview for Cumulus Radio

07:30.941 --> 07:32.098
is still on for tonight.

07:32.099 --> 07:33.058
You want me to cancel?

07:33.059 --> 07:35.311
No. We can't cancel anything
this close to the launch.

07:36.076 --> 07:38.007
Hey, Dr. lau. How's she doing?

07:38.439 --> 07:39.814
She's stabilized.

07:39.815 --> 07:41.747
We're waiting for the sedatives to wear off

07:41.748 --> 07:43.672
so we can evaluate her more fully.

07:43.673 --> 07:45.435
Okay. Thank you.

07:45.436 --> 07:46.059
Thanks.

07:46.967 --> 07:49.052
You want me to see if I can
squeeze in your publicist?

07:49.053 --> 07:50.606
I know she prepped you
for questions about Maddie,

07:50.607 --> 07:52.119
but you're gonna get asked about this, too.

07:52.120 --> 07:54.192
I think I just downplay it, you know?

07:54.193 --> 07:55.357
Well, I don't know if that's gonna fly

07:55.358 --> 07:56.547
with all that video that's out there.

07:56.548 --> 07:57.625
Well, we won't know what anything is

07:57.626 --> 08:00.247
until she wakes up and we talk to Scarlett

08:00.248 --> 08:01.373
and we talk to the doctor.

08:01.374 --> 08:04.550
And until then, I'm not
making any kind of...

08:04.551 --> 08:05.659
Decisions about what's happening.

08:07.251 --> 08:08.664
I can't believe you're
actually waiting to hear

08:08.665 --> 08:10.751
what anyone else has to say about anything.

08:12.107 --> 08:14.179
Wow. I'm gonna go find some coffee.

08:14.947 --> 08:16.983
You got something you want
to talk to me about, Beverly?

08:16.984 --> 08:18.399
Oh, cut the crap.

08:18.400 --> 08:20.719
Coming in here and trying
to mother my daughter

08:20.720 --> 08:23.232
when you can't even
handle your own family...

08:23.233 --> 08:25.774
I got a good hold of my
family, thank you very much.

08:25.775 --> 08:27.336
Oh, oh, not just your family.

08:27.337 --> 08:29.257
Actually, Maddie's Deacon's daughter.

08:29.258 --> 08:30.577
That makes her my niece,

08:30.578 --> 08:32.254
and you have been keeping her from us.

08:32.255 --> 08:33.751
Girl, you have got so much nerve.

08:33.753 --> 08:35.640
I know you've got everybody
around here fooled.

08:35.640 --> 08:36.984
I've known you 20 years,

08:36.985 --> 08:39.023
and I know for a fact
you have always cared more

08:39.024 --> 08:40.628
about what the world thinks of you

08:40.629 --> 08:42.962
rather than the actual people involved.

08:43.530 --> 08:45.873
Like, for instance,
marrying that trust-fund guy

08:45.874 --> 08:47.050
when you were pregnant.

08:47.051 --> 08:48.182
Beverly...

08:49.008 --> 08:50.216
You don't know me.

08:50.922 --> 08:53.850
You got a complicated relationship
with your brother. I get that.

08:53.851 --> 08:56.051
And you're concerned about
Scarlett. I get that, too.

08:56.396 --> 08:58.418
But don't you be blowing
off your steam at me.

08:58.419 --> 09:00.552
You find somebody else
to tangle with, you hear?

09:02.937 --> 09:05.013
So, now I'm just the taxi service? Huh?

09:05.014 --> 09:06.729
I can get Scarlett from Chicago to here,

09:06.730 --> 09:08.387
and then it's, "shoo.
Go sit in the corner."

09:10.685 --> 09:13.245
Charlie Wentworth's push
helped with uwantradio,

09:13.246 --> 09:15.012
but we're still not getting country play.

09:15.013 --> 09:16.584
Good news is, the tour's
down for a few weeks.

09:16.585 --> 09:18.399
Maybe we can reach out to country
radio again, get them to...

09:18.400 --> 09:20.421
and then... and then, "I
can take it from here."

09:20.422 --> 09:21.882
Like, "I'll take it from here."

09:21.883 --> 09:23.935
Why? 'Cause nobody else can do anything?

09:23.936 --> 09:26.240
While we're in town, we've got
the BMI party tomorrow night.

09:26.241 --> 09:27.319
I already RSVP'd...

09:27.320 --> 09:29.309
and then, "you should go
home. You should go home."

09:29.310 --> 09:30.801
<i>Like it was my fault.</i>

09:30.802 --> 09:32.175
I don't think she meant it like that.

09:32.176 --> 09:33.698
I think Rayna's just
panicked about Scarlett.

09:33.699 --> 09:35.236
<i>I'm panicked about Scarlett.</i>

09:35.537 --> 09:37.546
<i>That was my stage that she collapsed on.</i>

09:37.547 --> 09:39.868
<i>That was my boyfriend
that she's clinging to.</i>

09:40.315 --> 09:41.699
Hey.

09:41.700 --> 09:43.393
Hey. There you are.

09:43.698 --> 09:45.408
Uh, how's Scarlett? What's going on?

09:45.924 --> 09:49.425
Well, she's, uh, checked in
but not really talking yet.

09:49.426 --> 09:50.921
You know, still out of it.

09:50.922 --> 09:53.083
You look exhausted. Can I
get you something to eat?

09:53.084 --> 09:54.031
Thanks.

09:54.032 --> 09:56.644
I'd rather just hit the
shower and, uh, sleep a little.

09:59.452 --> 10:01.040
This is insane!

10:01.562 --> 10:03.585
I-I'm sorry. Poor choice of words.

10:03.586 --> 10:06.746
<i>But I should be the one Scarlett's
talking to, not anybody else.</i>

10:06.747 --> 10:09.092
I know from crazy moms, okay?

10:09.515 --> 10:11.844
Honey. There she is.

10:12.724 --> 10:15.404
There's my girl. Yeah, everything's okay.

10:15.948 --> 10:17.221
Mama?

10:19.315 --> 10:21.224
- Where am I?
- You're all right, honey.

10:22.140 --> 10:23.814
Uh, honey, you're in a clinic.

10:24.163 --> 10:25.174
- All right?
- Yeah.

10:25.731 --> 10:26.913
What happened?

10:27.616 --> 10:30.724
Scarlett, you had a breakdown, okay?

10:30.725 --> 10:33.384
Just like the one I had
when you were a little girl.

10:34.709 --> 10:36.006
You're okay. Don't fight it.

10:36.345 --> 10:37.959
What is this? What did you do?!

10:37.960 --> 10:39.217
No, no. Don't fight this,
honey. Don't fight it.

10:39.218 --> 10:40.286
What did you do?!

10:40.287 --> 10:41.527
Somebody, help!

10:41.528 --> 10:42.861
Scarlett, no!

10:42.862 --> 10:45.150
Did you have me committed?!
What did you do?!

10:45.151 --> 10:47.605
- Your stay here is voluntary.
- Get away from me!

10:47.954 --> 10:49.002
Just get me out of here!

10:57.688 --> 10:58.864
Hey, listen.

10:58.865 --> 11:00.335
Since Scarlett's been
staying at your house,

11:00.336 --> 11:02.264
have you noticed her drinking a lot

11:02.265 --> 11:04.494
or taking pills or whatever?

11:04.495 --> 11:05.975
Oh, yeah. We're doing a lot of that.

11:05.976 --> 11:08.023
We're back there drinking,
taking pills, smoking.

11:08.024 --> 11:09.327
It's a party.

11:09.328 --> 11:10.606
What?

11:10.607 --> 11:12.687
You're trying to say it's my
fault, right? That I'm the one...

11:12.688 --> 11:13.513
no, I'm not, Deacon.

11:13.514 --> 11:15.002
I'm trying to get to the
bottom of what happened...

11:15.356 --> 11:17.326
figure out what triggered this,
how long it's been going on.

11:17.327 --> 11:18.614
I don't know... she's been a little jumpy

11:18.615 --> 11:20.092
ever since she started working with Liam.

11:20.093 --> 11:22.261
But... Then again, whose idea was that?

11:23.604 --> 11:24.968
Okay.

11:24.969 --> 11:26.847
You know what? I'm gonna
let y'all handle this.

11:26.848 --> 11:28.178
Scarlett, stop!

11:28.179 --> 11:30.519
No, get off me! Get away!

11:33.753 --> 11:36.294
- Scarlett, you slow down!
- Beverly. Beverly.

11:36.295 --> 11:38.196
- Do not make me chase you in these shoes!
- Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

11:38.197 --> 11:41.173
- Scarlett! Scarlett!
- Stop yelling at her.

11:41.174 --> 11:42.675
Stop yelling at her. Stop it!

11:42.676 --> 11:43.898
Let go of me! Let me
talk to you for a second.

11:43.899 --> 11:45.227
Hey, honey? Scarlett?

11:45.228 --> 11:46.362
- Hey, girl...
- no, I'm not crazy.

11:46.363 --> 11:47.838
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
- I don't belong in a place like that.

11:47.839 --> 11:49.125
- I'm sorry.
- Come here. Come here. Come here.

11:49.126 --> 11:50.653
Come here. Come here. Come here. Come here.

11:50.654 --> 11:52.232
Just give her three
minutes. I'm begging you.

11:52.233 --> 11:53.183
You all right?

11:53.184 --> 11:54.585
I'm fine. I'm totally fine.

11:54.586 --> 11:56.519
I just  I want to go back to work.

11:56.520 --> 11:59.500
I know, but you had a lot
of alcohol in your system.

11:59.501 --> 12:00.619
Two drinks.

12:00.620 --> 12:02.590
Well, and prescription drugs, and...

12:03.236 --> 12:05.808
T-t-t-t-they're a pick-me-up.
They're like a caffeine tablet.

12:05.809 --> 12:08.632
Liam... Liam gave them to me.
He takes them all the time.

12:08.633 --> 12:11.947
<i>Do you take them all the
time now? You need that?</i>

12:11.948 --> 12:14.692
No! There's... there's
nothing wrong with me.

12:14.693 --> 12:16.885
I'm not... I'm not addicted to anything.

12:16.886 --> 12:19.735
I-I had a bad reaction to some alcohol

12:19.736 --> 12:21.716
- and, I guess, too many pills.
- I know.

12:21.717 --> 12:23.782
I just want to get my album fired back up.

12:23.783 --> 12:25.993
Just let me do what I want to
do, please. I hear you. I know.

12:25.994 --> 12:27.706
And I want what you want,
but I'll tell you something.

12:27.707 --> 12:28.759
I think what we need to do right now

12:29.450 --> 12:30.692
is we need to go back in there,

12:31.259 --> 12:33.090
we need to let these doctors look at you,

12:33.091 --> 12:34.941
make sure you're okay, you know?

12:34.942 --> 12:36.344
Give it 24 hours,

12:36.345 --> 12:38.476
and then I'll... I'll agree
with whatever you decide.

12:38.477 --> 12:39.993
No. No. I don't want to go back in there.

12:39.994 --> 12:41.203
I don't... I don't belong in there.

12:41.204 --> 12:42.197
I know, but, honey,

12:42.198 --> 12:43.649
you're standing out here in a field

12:43.650 --> 12:46.829
in... in your... Hospital gown.

12:46.830 --> 12:48.354
It's not making a good case for you.

12:48.793 --> 12:50.563
Just 24 hours, all right?

12:58.670 --> 13:00.399
Scarlett. Scarlett, baby.

13:00.400 --> 13:01.562
No.

13:01.563 --> 13:02.871
Beverly. Honey.

13:02.872 --> 13:04.356
See? See? Just give her a second.

13:04.357 --> 13:05.602
She's okay.

13:07.368 --> 13:09.622
I don't know... I don't think
I want a bunch of strangers

13:09.623 --> 13:11.698
following me around with cameras,

13:12.098 --> 13:13.460
watching me brush my teeth.

13:13.461 --> 13:14.965
No, but I really don't think
it's gonna be like that.

13:14.966 --> 13:18.366
You know, it's supposed to be
a slice of life, real reality.

13:18.367 --> 13:19.622
It'd be great for your album.

13:21.041 --> 13:23.103
Hey! There you two are.

13:23.104 --> 13:24.163
Oh, hey.

13:24.164 --> 13:25.293
- Is everything okay?
- Not really.

13:25.294 --> 13:28.766
Scarlett had a meltdown onstage...

13:28.767 --> 13:30.208
completely lost it.

13:30.209 --> 13:31.333
Wait... what?

13:31.334 --> 13:32.440
Is she okay?

13:32.441 --> 13:33.906
I don't know.

13:33.907 --> 13:35.209
That's awful.

13:35.210 --> 13:38.358
What do you do when
someone... when that happens?

13:38.359 --> 13:39.862
Yeah, we're trying to figure that out.

13:45.582 --> 13:46.623
Hey.

13:48.604 --> 13:49.866
They got them little cinnamon rolls...

13:49.867 --> 13:51.096
you see what she does?

13:55.874 --> 13:57.482
Look, sweetie, your mama's a handful,

13:57.483 --> 13:59.201
and we all know that... that's old news.

14:01.952 --> 14:03.199
I want to talk about...

14:04.974 --> 14:07.583
The pills, you know, the drinking.

14:08.078 --> 14:09.523
You know, you're half
Claybourne. You got to be careful.

14:09.524 --> 14:10.902
I wouldn't have reacted like that

14:10.903 --> 14:12.472
if she hadn't had them tie me to the bed.

14:13.026 --> 14:15.090
Wouldn't have run out there
and made a fool out of myself

14:15.091 --> 14:17.269
in front of everybo... in front of Rayna.

14:17.951 --> 14:19.851
Can't you see this is her doing?

14:20.939 --> 14:23.882
Baby, you're not here 'cause
of what happened outside.

14:23.883 --> 14:26.375
<i>That is exactly why I'm still here,</i>

14:27.048 --> 14:28.543
to prove to y'all what I already know...

14:28.544 --> 14:29.904
there's nothing wrong with me.

14:30.979 --> 14:33.282
You keep her away.

14:34.404 --> 14:35.449
I hate this.

14:35.450 --> 14:36.668
I hate that I'm not there with her.

14:36.669 --> 14:38.445
I hate that I wasn't there
for her when it happened.

14:38.446 --> 14:40.067
Hey, you couldn't have known.

14:40.068 --> 14:42.563
Should I call her? Or go over there?

14:43.161 --> 14:44.707
Things have been so weird with us.

14:44.708 --> 14:45.835
What if she kicks me out?

14:46.253 --> 14:47.720
Well, at least that'd be better

14:47.721 --> 14:50.661
than sitting here wondering about it.

14:50.662 --> 14:51.743
Come with me.

14:51.744 --> 14:54.122
<i>Then she would definitely kick you out.</i>

14:54.123 --> 14:55.523
I don't think that's true.

14:55.881 --> 14:57.428
Besides, I've got this last-minute meeting

14:57.429 --> 14:59.651
with Jeff Fordham, of all people.

14:59.652 --> 15:01.621
How can you be so cold about this?

15:02.458 --> 15:03.684
I'm not, okay?

15:04.578 --> 15:05.898
Look, the last time

15:05.899 --> 15:08.145
we tried to support each
other just as friends

15:08.146 --> 15:10.198
was the whole Kelly Clarkson mess.

15:12.291 --> 15:13.312
She made it pretty clear

15:13.313 --> 15:14.795
I'm not welcome in her life right now.

15:16.056 --> 15:16.977
I should probably just...

15:17.529 --> 15:19.576
Sit this one out completely, okay?

15:23.673 --> 15:25.445
It's good to see you up and about.

15:27.503 --> 15:28.761
You feeling better?

15:30.255 --> 15:31.315
Yeah.

15:33.122 --> 15:34.302
Doing some light reading?

15:38.941 --> 15:40.480
So, how are you?

15:41.528 --> 15:43.703
Everybody wants me to say I'm crazy.

15:44.444 --> 15:46.138
I'd be lying if I did that.

15:46.139 --> 15:47.385
I totally get it.

15:47.904 --> 15:49.843
People project stuff on me all the time,

15:50.363 --> 15:52.116
and it doesn't make it any better

15:52.117 --> 15:54.457
that you have a complicated
relationship with your mom.

15:54.857 --> 15:56.162
The amount of times that my mo...

15:56.163 --> 15:57.595
what are you even doing here?

15:58.493 --> 16:00.112
I was worried about you.

16:00.113 --> 16:02.702
Were you worried about me
when you sent me out onstage?

16:04.102 --> 16:06.486
What about when you hauled
me off of it, had me sedated,

16:06.487 --> 16:08.512
and whisked me across the
country in your private jet?

16:08.513 --> 16:09.590
Were you worried about me then?

16:09.591 --> 16:11.748
You want to sit here and
talk like we're old buddies?

16:12.067 --> 16:13.865
It's your fault I'm here.

16:13.866 --> 16:16.907
Uh, look, I think I know
what you're going through,

16:16.908 --> 16:17.871
and maybe I can help.

16:17.872 --> 16:20.053
Oh, my God! Would you stop trying
to make everything about you?

16:20.054 --> 16:21.406
You did that enough in Chicago.

16:21.407 --> 16:22.777
I had a minor hiccup onstage...

16:22.778 --> 16:25.504
a hiccup? Yeah, maybe in some
parallel universe, that was a hiccup.

16:25.505 --> 16:27.687
I froze for a second. That is all. So what?

16:28.759 --> 16:32.120
It was more than a second,
and you did more than freeze.

16:32.121 --> 16:33.891
I was there. I know what happened.

16:34.425 --> 16:35.404
Do you?

16:36.773 --> 16:37.948
I'd like you to leave now.

16:39.000 --> 16:45.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

16:48.130 --> 16:49.185
We got the tests back,

16:49.186 --> 16:51.169
and, all in all, things are looking good.

16:51.170 --> 16:52.704
The drugs have cleared her system,

16:52.705 --> 16:54.751
and she's not showing any
symptoms of withdrawal.

16:55.435 --> 16:56.386
Hey.

16:56.987 --> 16:58.434
What are you doing? I
thought you went home.

16:58.765 --> 17:01.215
For heaven's sake. She
collapsed on my stage.

17:01.216 --> 17:02.778
I know. What happened?

17:02.779 --> 17:04.932
She said she didn't want to
go on, you wanted her to go on.

17:04.933 --> 17:06.790
- What's the story?
- Nothing. Nothing happened.

17:06.790 --> 17:09.554
I'm just, apparently, the
world's biggest jackass, okay?

17:09.997 --> 17:11.224
Happy?

17:18.393 --> 17:19.590
You don't have to stay out here.

17:19.592 --> 17:21.308
Scarlett's got everything
right back in her room.

17:21.309 --> 17:22.249
I can't. I can't.

17:22.250 --> 17:25.310
I-I don't even feel right about
leaving her in that hospital alone.

17:25.311 --> 17:26.512
All right, those people are the best.

17:26.512 --> 17:27.864
They're gonna take good care of her, okay?

17:27.865 --> 17:29.556
<i>I should be the one down
there taking care of her.</i>

17:29.557 --> 17:30.912
It should be me down there.

17:30.913 --> 17:32.482
Not that you would understand that,

17:32.483 --> 17:34.036
'cause you tried to physically restrain me

17:34.037 --> 17:35.688
while I was trying to talk to my daughter.

17:35.689 --> 17:37.107
Yeah, well, some of that talking

17:37.108 --> 17:38.367
was starting to sound like yelling.

17:38.821 --> 17:40.047
You are unbelievable.

17:40.477 --> 17:42.011
Hey, I'm surprised you even showed up,

17:42.012 --> 17:43.279
given your track record.

17:43.280 --> 17:44.568
I mean, isn't this, like, the perfect time

17:44.569 --> 17:46.068
for you to disappear?

17:46.069 --> 17:47.534
You got to make up your mind, Beverly.

17:48.000 --> 17:49.852
Either I'm the jerk who's
never there when you need him

17:49.853 --> 17:50.845
or I'm the white knight

17:50.846 --> 17:52.606
always trying to swoop
in and save everybody.

17:53.019 --> 17:54.433
Pretty hard to be both.

17:54.434 --> 17:56.259
Yet you manage it so well.

17:56.260 --> 17:57.726
Makes it even worse.

17:57.727 --> 18:00.369
'Cause you get people's hopes
up and then you bail on them.

18:00.370 --> 18:01.948
Everything that's going on,
you want to do this right now?

18:01.949 --> 18:04.892
Do what? Talk about things that
actually matter? Yeah. I do.

18:04.893 --> 18:06.058
- All right, let's do it.
- Okay.

18:08.018 --> 18:10.347
You could have got on that
bus with me, all right?

18:10.348 --> 18:11.859
I begged you to, but
you wanted to stay behind

18:11.860 --> 18:13.166
and marry that jackass Doug...

18:13.167 --> 18:14.180
I was pregnant!

18:14.181 --> 18:16.959
Not yet. You weren't. Okay?
You and I both know that.

18:17.468 --> 18:19.539
First you stayed, and
then you got pregnant.

18:19.540 --> 18:21.615
And anything else is just
you trying to rewrite history.

18:21.616 --> 18:23.422
Now, my guitar gave me a way out of there.

18:23.423 --> 18:24.861
Damn it, I took it.

18:24.862 --> 18:26.584
Sure as hell didn't have
anything to stay for.

18:27.384 --> 18:29.026
<i>You could've stayed for me.</i>

18:31.119 --> 18:35.525
Daddy was the meanest
son of a bitch I ever met,

18:35.526 --> 18:38.003
and mama was no help, and you know it.

18:38.004 --> 18:42.406
It was just you and me
in the trenches together,

18:42.407 --> 18:43.986
and you left!

18:43.987 --> 18:45.503
I'm sorry, okay? I'm sorry.

18:45.504 --> 18:46.770
I had to go. I had...

18:47.458 --> 18:48.777
if I hadn't left, there'd have been nobody

18:48.778 --> 18:50.794
to pay for Scarlett to go to Ole Miss or...

18:52.136 --> 18:55.269
You know, for you...
get the help you needed.

18:55.270 --> 18:56.548
If you hadn't have left,

18:56.549 --> 18:58.758
I wouldn't have needed any help, Deacon!

18:59.360 --> 19:02.410
You bailed on me, and then Doug left,

19:02.411 --> 19:05.380
- and then Scarlett followed you down here.
- That's my fault? That's my...

19:05.381 --> 19:06.983
- you were the first!
- Your life is my fault?!

19:06.984 --> 19:08.302
<i>- I couldn't recover! It is your fault!
- It's my...</i>

19:08.303 --> 19:09.360
<i>it is your fault!</i>

19:09.361 --> 19:12.204
You're an angry, narcissistic, manic mess!

19:12.205 --> 19:13.494
That's your fault!

19:13.495 --> 19:16.559
Well, it's better than
being a pathetic drunk,

19:16.560 --> 19:17.831
like your daddy!

19:21.757 --> 19:23.683
Oh, yeah. Just walk away.

19:23.684 --> 19:25.645
I don't know why I'd expect anything else.

19:33.755 --> 19:35.500
Wow. Nice place for a meeting.

19:35.501 --> 19:36.986
Yeah. Thanks for coming out.

19:36.987 --> 19:39.893
Well, you made it sound like
I couldn't afford not to.

19:40.630 --> 19:42.131
I want you to come over to Edgehill.

19:44.017 --> 19:45.215
To do what?

19:45.683 --> 19:46.697
I mean, you made it pretty clear

19:47.070 --> 19:48.861
I wasn't wanted as an artist there.

19:48.862 --> 19:50.357
I'm starting a publishing division.

19:50.823 --> 19:52.488
I'm gonna build a stable of songwriters,

19:53.328 --> 19:55.035
and I want you to be the first.

19:55.036 --> 19:56.145
Well, I'm flattered,

19:56.146 --> 19:58.213
but I already have a deal at South Circle.

19:58.214 --> 20:00.128
What, uh, what's your split there? Hmm?

20:00.129 --> 20:01.560
50/50? No co-publishing?

20:02.355 --> 20:05.507
I am offering you co-publishing plus 75%.

20:05.839 --> 20:07.087
Hell, with a deal like that,

20:07.088 --> 20:08.729
maybe you can join a place like this.

20:09.735 --> 20:12.077
You know, word around town
is Edgehill's on the ropes

20:12.954 --> 20:14.282
<i>and you are, too.</i>

20:14.283 --> 20:16.684
I mean, it must be hard staying at the top

20:16.685 --> 20:18.827
after losing Juliette
Barnes and Rayna James.

20:19.816 --> 20:21.265
You're right.

20:21.266 --> 20:24.037
I'm, uh... I'm in a tight spot.

20:24.038 --> 20:25.723
But I'm fighting to get up off the mat.

20:26.671 --> 20:27.890
Is that what you want to hear?

20:29.082 --> 20:31.464
Yeah, well, you probably
just started getting royalties

20:31.465 --> 20:32.822
from "Ball and Chain," right?

20:33.575 --> 20:35.019
- Yeah.
- Yeah, it's nice.

20:35.020 --> 20:35.891
It is.

20:35.892 --> 20:37.456
<i>That  one number-one, Gunnar.</i>

20:38.200 --> 20:40.749
Now think about the fact that
I have got a stable of artists

20:41.050 --> 20:43.324
who have a habit of sitting
at the top of the charts.

20:43.325 --> 20:44.528
This is the big leagues, man.

20:44.847 --> 20:46.072
No more blowing opportunities

20:46.073 --> 20:47.987
with a-list talent like Kelly Clarkson.

20:48.886 --> 20:50.388
I didn't blow that opportunity.

20:50.389 --> 20:51.629
No. No, you didn't.

20:51.997 --> 20:53.535
Your loony ex-partner did.

20:55.719 --> 20:58.026
Scarlett O'Connor has more talent

20:58.027 --> 20:59.706
than most of us dream about.

20:59.707 --> 21:01.989
She's the one who pulled
the good music out of me.

21:02.883 --> 21:04.016
I owe her everything.

21:05.167 --> 21:06.525
You just called her a loony.

21:07.550 --> 21:08.839
You can take your deal.

21:09.388 --> 21:11.203
You can go shove it.

21:14.288 --> 21:16.129
The doctors say she's not an addict.

21:16.130 --> 21:17.519
I mean, from a business perspective,

21:17.520 --> 21:18.916
there's no question the best thing would be

21:18.917 --> 21:20.142
for her to get right back out there.

21:20.143 --> 21:21.436
You... you have Evan Ryder,

21:21.437 --> 21:22.983
- Hey, Rayna.
- But Scarlett's a lot... hey.

21:22.984 --> 21:25.138
Scarlett's a lot closer to
contributing to your bottom line.

21:25.139 --> 21:26.907
I mean, I don't know what's
the right thing to do here.

21:26.908 --> 21:28.469
I don't want to box her
in with one interview.

21:28.470 --> 21:30.176
Well, Jason's gonna push
you hard to commit to this,

21:30.177 --> 21:31.119
trying to get you to say...

21:31.120 --> 21:33.050
I play this game better than he does.

21:33.051 --> 21:34.744
- Hey!
- Hey! How are you?

21:34.745 --> 21:35.840
- How are you, friend?
- Doing well.

21:49.341 --> 21:51.525
I'm real sorry you blame me for your life.

21:51.875 --> 21:53.393
<i>But it's not about us anymore.</i>

21:55.915 --> 21:57.558
It's about that sweet girl of yours.

21:58.366 --> 22:00.907
Let's let her make her choice
about how much help she wants.

22:01.886 --> 22:03.864
And then when she does,
you and me, we'll just...

22:05.610 --> 22:07.332
<i>We'll give her what we never got...</i>

22:08.335 --> 22:10.207
unconditional love and support.

22:11.943 --> 22:13.160
No matter what.

22:16.867 --> 22:17.902
Hey.

22:19.093 --> 22:20.034
Hey.

22:22.690 --> 22:24.134
It's gonna be okay.

22:25.313 --> 22:27.831
<i>Leave me alone!</i>

22:32.602 --> 22:34.285
<i>Go away!</i>

22:35.030 --> 22:36.590
<i>What did I do to you?!</i>

22:36.591 --> 22:38.204
<i>What did I do?!</i>

22:39.361 --> 22:40.726
<i>I'm sorry...</i>

22:45.023 --> 22:46.614
I can't believe you came.

22:47.983 --> 22:49.842
Can't believe you thought I wouldn't.

22:53.151 --> 22:55.516
Remember all those night
I came to stay with you

22:55.906 --> 22:57.743
when mama was at the farm?

22:59.762 --> 23:00.931
I'd sit in your bed

23:00.932 --> 23:03.170
Wondering if I'd turn out like her.

23:05.779 --> 23:07.574
How did I get here?

23:18.727 --> 23:21.209
It's not like I forced her
to get up there on that stage.

23:21.210 --> 23:23.539
I just told her that's
the way the business works.

23:23.540 --> 23:25.112
It's kind of the same thing.

23:27.018 --> 23:27.922
What was that?

23:29.023 --> 23:30.498
I said, "it's kind of the same thing."

23:30.499 --> 23:33.285
"That's how the business works,"
means "shut up and do it."

23:33.286 --> 23:35.021
I see how she could see it that way.

23:35.022 --> 23:36.047
That I forced her?

23:36.460 --> 23:38.186
She's scared and vulnerable,

23:38.187 --> 23:40.081
and you tell her, "that's how it works."

23:40.082 --> 23:41.571
You don't know how her mind...

23:42.663 --> 23:44.017
Okay, so you're taking her side?

23:44.018 --> 23:45.933
No! I'm not taking anyone's side!

23:46.391 --> 23:47.860
I just need some sleep.

23:50.657 --> 23:51.977
I'm sorry, okay?

23:52.541 --> 23:53.740
I'm in a mood.

23:54.948 --> 23:56.583
But if we're in bed...

23:58.185 --> 24:00.533
You in the mood for something like this?

24:08.722 --> 24:09.921
Juliette...

24:11.393 --> 24:12.866
Okay, babe, listen.

24:12.867 --> 24:14.095
I just...

24:14.096 --> 24:15.174
stop.

24:16.404 --> 24:17.587
Are you kidding?

24:20.250 --> 24:22.318
First, you didn't care
that Charlie kissed me,

24:22.319 --> 24:23.992
and now I can't even
get you to sleep with me.

24:23.993 --> 24:25.729
I never said either of those things.

24:27.132 --> 24:28.393
But now that you brought it up,

24:28.394 --> 24:29.840
is that why Charlie was hanging around?

24:29.841 --> 24:31.654
I mean, are you trying to
make me jealous or something?

24:31.655 --> 24:33.190
Why would I need to make you jealous?

24:33.191 --> 24:35.261
I don't know... why are you
acting like a crazy person

24:35.262 --> 24:37.087
every time anything with Scarlett comes up?

24:37.088 --> 24:38.333
<i>So I'm crazy now?</i>

24:38.849 --> 24:40.134
You know what?

24:40.135 --> 24:41.431
I can't do this tonight.

24:47.147 --> 24:48.726
Let's talk about your new single.

24:48.727 --> 24:50.044
It's called "This Time."

24:50.045 --> 24:52.567
You co-wrote it with none
other than Deacon Claybourne.

24:52.568 --> 24:55.229
That's right. It was... it
was an amazing collaboration.

24:55.230 --> 24:58.037
And, uh... Speaking of Deacon Claybourne...

24:58.038 --> 24:58.863
Yeah?

24:58.864 --> 25:00.917
I've got to ask you. Our
listeners are dying to know.

25:00.918 --> 25:02.866
They want to hear you
talk about him and, uh,

25:02.867 --> 25:04.236
and about your daughter, as well.

25:04.237 --> 25:06.835
Well, listen, I think
everyone has really respected

25:06.836 --> 25:09.133
that this is a private, family issue,

25:09.134 --> 25:11.280
and... and so we're gonna keep it at that.

25:11.281 --> 25:13.986
Let's delve into a little
bit about Scarlett O'Connor.

25:13.987 --> 25:15.047
She's your young artist.

25:15.048 --> 25:17.559
Had a pretty public
meltdown onstage last night.

25:17.560 --> 25:18.777
I don't think people realize

25:19.175 --> 25:22.682
how exhausting these tours can be,

25:22.683 --> 25:25.342
and especially when
it's your first time out,

25:25.343 --> 25:26.674
as it... as it is for her.

25:26.675 --> 25:30.094
Are you telling us that
that's a first-time offense,

25:30.421 --> 25:32.567
one and only, never gonna happen again,

25:32.568 --> 25:34.299
she's gonna hit the road again next month?

25:34.300 --> 25:37.617
Or is she going to be too "exhausted"?

25:37.618 --> 25:39.987
She is a wonderful artist,
and as far as I'm concerned,

25:39.988 --> 25:41.836
she can do whatever the heck she wants.

25:41.837 --> 25:43.674
And in the meantime, I'm gonna be out there

25:44.300 --> 25:47.138
lunching my new album... may 1st.

25:47.139 --> 25:49.091
Let's spin the brand-new
single from you right now.

25:49.092 --> 25:52.157
Here we go. Here's Rayna with "This Time."

25:54.421 --> 25:55.586
Man!

25:55.587 --> 25:56.407
I'm sorry.

25:56.408 --> 25:58.486
So, look... no commitment
one way or the other?

25:58.487 --> 25:59.971
No!

25:59.972 --> 26:03.618
Scarlett's crack-up is a
win/win for you and Highway 65.

26:03.619 --> 26:06.819
She hits the road, you guys
get a ton of free pub out of it.

26:06.820 --> 26:07.953
Or, y-you know,

26:07.954 --> 26:09.759
you lock her up in a funny
farm for a month or two.

26:09.760 --> 26:11.174
She's out in 30 or 60 days.

26:11.533 --> 26:13.388
Next thing she knows, she's telling stories

26:13.389 --> 26:15.790
that she can dine out on for
the rest of her entire career.

26:15.791 --> 26:19.209
I'm not gonna go for the tabloid tragedy.

26:19.210 --> 26:21.832
It's the tabloid tragedy that
keeps this industry running.

26:21.833 --> 26:22.821
You know that.

26:22.822 --> 26:24.396
You set it to music... yeehaw!...

26:24.397 --> 26:26.381
you got yourself a good old country song.

26:27.069 --> 26:28.447
It's just business.

26:31.573 --> 26:32.737
I remember walking out there...

26:33.716 --> 26:35.944
And the band started to play...

26:37.410 --> 26:41.765
And then there was this moment
of real light-headedness,

26:41.766 --> 26:42.948
and, um...

26:44.732 --> 26:46.815
Honestly, after that, it's really fuzzy.

26:48.309 --> 26:50.536
Do you remember now that
you've seen the video?

26:52.524 --> 26:53.531
Mnh-mnh.

26:54.078 --> 26:56.037
That's the thing that's
the scariest part...

26:56.038 --> 26:57.408
how you forget that.

26:57.409 --> 26:59.094
<i>Maybe I am losing it.</i>

26:59.095 --> 27:00.994
No. You're just overwhelmed.

27:02.122 --> 27:03.435
Maybe.

27:07.958 --> 27:09.324
What do you want to do?

27:10.688 --> 27:12.091
It's okay.

27:12.499 --> 27:13.604
You sure?

27:14.533 --> 27:16.577
- Yeah.
- Okay.

27:26.681 --> 27:29.464
My baby. My sweet, sweet girl.

27:31.015 --> 27:32.094
Come on.

27:33.280 --> 27:35.469
I love you so much, honey.

27:35.470 --> 27:36.952
You know that, right?

27:40.824 --> 27:41.797
Listen...

27:42.736 --> 27:45.597
I've been through the
exact same thing, honey,

27:45.598 --> 27:47.938
and this is something we got to face.

27:47.939 --> 27:50.967
You stay here, and we get
you all the help you need.

27:51.996 --> 27:54.903
But, Scarlett, you got
to hear me when I tell you

27:55.298 --> 27:57.973
this is something that runs in our family.

27:57.974 --> 27:59.684
It's... it's like a curse.

27:59.685 --> 28:02.678
This is not your fault. I promise you that.

28:03.309 --> 28:05.045
My sweet girl.

28:05.046 --> 28:06.335
It's gonna be okay.

28:07.451 --> 28:09.193
- There you go.
- Thank you so much.

28:09.194 --> 28:10.418
You're welcome. All right.

28:11.960 --> 28:13.387
You get it?  All right.

28:13.388 --> 28:16.151
Hey, thank y'all for coming.
I appreciate it. Thank you.

28:16.152 --> 28:17.514
Hope you like stuff like this.

28:17.515 --> 28:19.105
Next few weeks are gonna
be stacked with events,

28:19.106 --> 28:20.293
both here and on the road.

28:20.294 --> 28:22.095
Hey, if all this stuff
helps me sell records,

28:22.096 --> 28:25.166
Then, uh, yeah, I'll get used to liking it.

28:25.167 --> 28:27.921
Got a call today from Gina Romano.

28:27.922 --> 28:29.504
I was meaning to ask you about that.

28:29.505 --> 28:32.039
You know, for all my other
artists, I'd be all for it,

28:32.376 --> 28:33.932
but you really think a reality show

28:33.933 --> 28:36.445
with cameras following you
everywhere is a good idea?

28:36.446 --> 28:38.447
<i>Why would it be okay
for them but not for me?</i>

28:38.839 --> 28:41.318
I mean, if people
watching me brush my teeth

28:41.319 --> 28:43.930
and hang out with my wife
helps me sell records...

28:44.325 --> 28:47.923
we both know why this is
a terrible idea for you.

28:49.227 --> 28:50.619
Really? Why?

28:51.354 --> 28:54.092
Well, you really want me to say it? Hmm?

28:54.093 --> 28:56.987
'Cause I'd like to maintain
some plausible deniability here.

28:59.460 --> 29:01.108
You give it some serious thought

29:01.109 --> 29:03.099
before you expose yourself like that.

29:19.160 --> 29:20.241
Avery?

29:21.122 --> 29:23.664
Hey, I'm sorry I was
being such a brat before.

29:23.665 --> 29:26.099
I overreacted. I was just tired.

29:27.671 --> 29:29.028
Hello?

29:32.711 --> 29:34.352
<i>Don't you touch me! Don't you touch me!</i>

29:34.353 --> 29:35.960
<i>I told you... never touch me!</i>

29:37.404 --> 29:39.363
<i>Tell me what I did to
make you so angry with me.</i>

29:40.726 --> 29:42.726
<i>Why are you doing this to me?!</i>

30:06.263 --> 30:07.846
The only thing we Claybournes are good at

30:07.847 --> 30:09.827
is blaming other people for our problems.

30:10.232 --> 30:11.946
Beverly just unloaded on me.

30:12.437 --> 30:14.095
That's never fun.

30:14.096 --> 30:15.762
But it's even worse when I realize that...

30:18.131 --> 30:21.591
<i>She sounds just like me... blaming you</i>

30:22.326 --> 30:25.081
for things that, uh, you couldn't control.

30:26.094 --> 30:27.843
None of this is your fault.

30:31.126 --> 30:32.866
I was trying to protect her.

30:34.761 --> 30:36.537
I mean, when I started Highway 65,

30:36.538 --> 30:37.782
that was the whole point, you know?

30:37.783 --> 30:39.657
I want to create a refuge
for these artists...

30:40.896 --> 30:43.968
Try to protect them from all the pain...

30:45.512 --> 30:48.162
That this can bring, you know?

30:53.599 --> 30:56.302
I remember how you were
when she was first born.

30:57.038 --> 30:58.661
Never seen you like that.

31:05.207 --> 31:07.191
I don't know what I'm
gonna do about this label.

31:09.015 --> 31:13.335

Is it about Scarlett?

32:25.190 --> 32:26.783
I guess.

32:26.784 --> 32:28.022
Maybe.

32:36.750 --> 32:38.119
You think she's gonna be okay?

32:39.108 --> 32:40.386
I don't know.

33:24.025 --> 33:26.168
- Morning.
- Hey.

33:26.169 --> 33:28.404
Sorry. Guess I fell asleep.

33:34.137 --> 33:37.225
The last few days have
been kind of rough, huh?

33:38.421 --> 33:40.440
That is the understatement of the year.

33:41.541 --> 33:42.844
How you feeling?

33:45.533 --> 33:46.759
Not really sure yet.

33:51.481 --> 33:52.853
What are you doing here?

33:54.247 --> 33:57.648
You wouldn't let go of
my hand when it happened.

33:59.541 --> 34:02.005
I know how you feel about Beverly, and...

34:03.334 --> 34:04.757
I know you.

34:04.758 --> 34:06.455
And I just figured a friendly face

34:06.456 --> 34:07.984
wouldn't be a bad thing.

34:09.893 --> 34:11.266
It's not.

34:13.527 --> 34:15.639
Thank you for always being there for me.

34:17.908 --> 34:19.606
You were my first love.

34:21.114 --> 34:22.493
You know that?

34:23.532 --> 34:26.382
I don't think I'll ever love
anyone as much as I loved you.

34:28.255 --> 34:31.152
I don't want anything bad to happen to you.

34:31.154 --> 34:32.460
You hear me?

34:33.346 --> 34:36.541
You got a permanent piece
of my heart, Scarlett.

34:38.283 --> 34:39.855
Always will.

34:56.734 --> 34:58.816
Hey.

34:58.817 --> 35:00.333
Clean bill of health from the doctors, huh?

35:01.067 --> 35:03.660
Well, yeah. I already knew
I wasn't a drug addict.

35:03.661 --> 35:04.871
So did I.

35:06.399 --> 35:07.923
When can I go back out?

35:10.476 --> 35:12.857
I think you been spending a lot of time

35:12.858 --> 35:14.801
<i>worrying about what's gonna make me happy.</i>

35:16.134 --> 35:17.680
Now's the time for you to think about

35:17.681 --> 35:19.332
<i>what's gonna make you happy.</i>

35:21.067 --> 35:23.386
I'm gonna ask you a question
that I asked you before.

35:24.394 --> 35:26.056
I want you to answer me honestly.

35:29.352 --> 35:30.642
Do you want this?

35:34.721 --> 35:36.237
No, I don't.

35:38.811 --> 35:40.601
I don't know what I want, but...

35:42.691 --> 35:44.136
I don't want this.

35:45.141 --> 35:48.110
Feel like you've been trying
to tell me that for a while.

35:49.084 --> 35:50.838
Sorry I wasted your time.

35:50.839 --> 35:53.298
<i>Hey, listen, you figured out
something you don't want to do.</i>

35:53.299 --> 35:54.583
I mean, that is every bit as important

35:54.584 --> 35:56.352
<i>as figuring out what you do want to do.</i>

35:57.042 --> 35:58.903
You've got a great future ahead of you.

35:59.676 --> 36:02.096
It's just gonna mean going
down a different road.

36:04.441 --> 36:06.364
I'm gonna release you from your contract.

36:18.079 --> 36:21.144
Whoa! Haven't seen the girls
out like that in a while.

36:21.664 --> 36:23.922
Know what... I'm allowed to get dressed up

36:23.923 --> 36:25.730
and go out whenever I want to.

36:26.112 --> 36:27.482
I was just kidding.

36:27.846 --> 36:30.053
The car's gonna be here
pretty soon. Where's Avery?

36:30.655 --> 36:33.806
Avery is... Too busy
with his ex-girlfriend

36:33.807 --> 36:35.871
to be concerned about his current one.

36:35.872 --> 36:38.257
Well... I'll come with you. It'll be fun.

36:38.258 --> 36:41.926
No. I don't need a pity
date or a babysitter, okay?

36:41.927 --> 36:43.326
I'm going alone.

36:47.312 --> 36:48.484
You wanted me?

36:48.908 --> 36:49.948
Yeah.

36:50.869 --> 36:52.137
I need you to drive me home.

36:53.054 --> 36:54.241
Oh.

36:56.338 --> 36:57.972
No more pills, right?

36:58.819 --> 37:00.270
<i>What do you reckon?</i>

37:04.328 --> 37:05.506
Okay.

37:06.050 --> 37:07.164
Hey.

37:08.441 --> 37:09.622
What are you doing?

37:10.030 --> 37:12.867
I'm, uh... I'm signing myself out.

37:12.868 --> 37:15.655
Wait a minute. Are you
even cleared to do that?

37:15.656 --> 37:17.779
I mean, honey, what about
everything that we talked about?

37:17.780 --> 37:18.811
I understand

37:18.812 --> 37:20.621
that your time at the farm
was very valuable to you,

37:20.622 --> 37:22.424
but this is not what
my life is going to be,

37:22.425 --> 37:23.530
so I'm leaving.

37:24.973 --> 37:26.547
Did you put her up to this?

37:26.548 --> 37:28.181
No, but I thought we talked
about letting her do what...

37:28.182 --> 37:29.481
this is between me and Scarlett.

37:29.482 --> 37:31.241
- It's between her. She...
- I need you to stay out of this!

37:31.242 --> 37:32.502
Would you stop it, please?

37:33.617 --> 37:34.751
God, you're...

37:34.752 --> 37:36.941
you blame everybody else for everything.

37:36.942 --> 37:38.468
You are angry at the universe,

37:38.469 --> 37:39.862
and you take it out on everybody.

37:39.863 --> 37:41.008
You do.

37:41.009 --> 37:42.228
And now you want me to stay here

37:42.229 --> 37:43.584
and pretend I don't got no choice.

37:44.295 --> 37:45.519
I have a choice.

37:46.049 --> 37:47.228
And I made a whole lot of bad ones.

37:47.229 --> 37:49.189
<i>I did that. I made bad decisions.</i>

37:49.190 --> 37:50.701
Nobody else did it for me.

37:52.848 --> 37:54.105
Baby, okay.

37:54.919 --> 37:57.642
You're still sick, and you need help.

37:57.643 --> 38:00.078
And listen... I've already decided

38:00.079 --> 38:02.043
I'm gonna move up here and I'm gonna stay

38:02.044 --> 38:03.498
and take care of you as long as...

38:03.499 --> 38:05.191
mama, mama, I love you.

38:05.765 --> 38:06.995
I really do.

38:07.946 --> 38:12.186
