00:02.085 --> 00:05.086
What I need you to do
is put this

00:05.088 --> 00:08.322
on Mashkov's clothes
so we can get ears on him.

00:08.324 --> 00:10.558
We don't want your colleagues
getting suspicious.

00:10.560 --> 00:13.461
I know we're not working
together anymore,

00:13.463 --> 00:16.197
but it would be nice
to still see you.

00:16.199 --> 00:17.732
Yeah, I'd love that.

00:20.136 --> 00:21.136
Yes?

00:21.137 --> 00:23.604
- What happened?
- She was shot.

00:33.216 --> 00:34.582
I need to get
away from all this.

00:34.584 --> 00:36.784
I know a way out of here you
can escape without being seen.

00:36.786 --> 00:37.786
Come on.

00:37.787 --> 00:41.456
I had Belenko, and I lost him,

00:41.458 --> 00:43.491
and now he's got Auggie.

00:43.493 --> 00:44.559
We have to find him.

00:47.097 --> 00:49.363
Tell me what happened
to James Deckard.

00:49.365 --> 00:50.465
He's dead.

00:50.467 --> 00:52.300
You're not going to shoot me,
Annie,

00:52.302 --> 00:53.468
because you want Auggie to live.

00:53.470 --> 00:57.205
I, however, do not.

00:59.709 --> 01:00.842
This isn't over.

01:00.844 --> 01:03.644
The people Belenko
was targeting in my unit,

01:03.646 --> 01:06.547
there's one guy
still alive--James Deckard.

01:06.549 --> 01:08.116
Belenko knows about him,

01:08.118 --> 01:10.351
which means we've got
to get to him first.

01:36.779 --> 01:38.579
- That's the one.
- We ready?

01:38.581 --> 01:39.581
Yeah, let's go.

01:46.723 --> 01:49.824
"G. da Silva"?

01:49.826 --> 01:51.526
Maybe it's an alias.

01:59.836 --> 02:02.737
We sure he lives here?

02:02.739 --> 02:04.438
There's one way to find out.

02:15.485 --> 02:16.485
Deckard?

02:24.761 --> 02:26.694
This mail's three months old.

02:39.709 --> 02:41.709
This place has been tossed.

02:41.711 --> 02:43.344
Does it look like
there was a struggle,

02:43.346 --> 02:45.479
or does it look like someone
was looking for something?

02:45.481 --> 02:47.848
Looks like someone
was looking for something.

03:06.269 --> 03:07.501
It's a shortwave radio.

03:07.503 --> 03:08.869
This has to be
Deckard's place.

03:08.871 --> 03:11.405
It's for the numbers station.

03:11.407 --> 03:12.640
It was Deckard's idea.

03:12.642 --> 03:14.675
He never responded
to my last transmission.

03:18.615 --> 03:21.415
Annie, look at this.

03:23.586 --> 03:24.852
He coached soccer.

03:24.854 --> 03:26.621
He coached--

03:26.623 --> 03:28.889
I didn't know that.

03:28.891 --> 03:30.524
I don't know
what he's been up to at all.

03:30.526 --> 03:32.260
I should've insisted
on a more consistent

03:32.262 --> 03:33.527
means of communication.

03:41.037 --> 03:42.970
Your friend is in jail.

03:42.972 --> 03:45.539
- He's in jail?
- Yeah, he assaulted a cop.

03:45.541 --> 03:47.008
A few months ago,

03:47.010 --> 03:49.577
a drug dealer was preying
on one of his players.

03:49.579 --> 03:51.012
He had a few words with him.

03:51.014 --> 03:52.480
Things got heated up.

03:52.482 --> 03:54.048
You said he assaulted a cop.

03:54.050 --> 03:56.317
Officer Sosa was
on the dealer's payroll.

03:56.319 --> 03:57.418
The judge was too.

03:57.420 --> 03:58.686
I cannot even schedule
a hearing.

03:58.688 --> 03:59.954
Where are they keeping him?

03:59.956 --> 04:01.722
<i>Penitenciario siete,</i>

04:01.724 --> 04:03.491
where they keep
all the foreign nationals.

04:03.493 --> 04:04.825
When's the last time
you spoke with him?

04:04.827 --> 04:06.060
About a week ago.

04:06.062 --> 04:09.630
How soon can you get me
in there to see him?

04:28.818 --> 04:30.384
<i>Puerta.</i>

04:44.467 --> 04:48.536
What the hell?

04:48.538 --> 04:51.739
Oh, shit, Auggie.

04:51.741 --> 04:53.674
What the hell?
What are you doing here, man?

04:53.676 --> 04:55.810
Our deal was
no more face-to-faces.

04:55.812 --> 04:58.045
You didn't respond to my SOS.

04:58.047 --> 05:01.082
You sent an SOS?
Okay, that can't be good.

05:01.084 --> 05:03.384
Hey, it's not safe
for you in here.

05:03.386 --> 05:04.386
- No shit.
- No.

05:04.387 --> 05:07.755
I mean someone wants you dead.

05:07.757 --> 05:09.957
You remember Mikhail Kokorin?

05:09.959 --> 05:11.892
Yeah, last mission
I did for the Agency.

05:11.894 --> 05:13.427
How could I forget?

05:13.429 --> 05:16.597
His brother hasn't forgotten
either.

05:16.599 --> 05:19.934
He goes by the name
Aleksandre Belenko.

05:19.936 --> 05:23.537
He put a target
on all our backs.

05:23.539 --> 05:25.973
What do you mean?

05:25.975 --> 05:29.143
Charlie Schinderman's dead.

05:29.145 --> 05:33.581
Nate Mueller too.

05:33.583 --> 05:36.484
And Tony?

05:36.486 --> 05:39.520
Belenko killed them all, man.

05:39.522 --> 05:40.755
It's just you and me, brother.

05:40.757 --> 05:43.457
We're all that's left.

05:43.459 --> 05:45.526
Now, I need you
to keep your head on a swivel

05:45.528 --> 05:47.395
until we can get you
out of here.

05:47.397 --> 05:49.063
By "we,"
I assume you mean the Agency?

05:49.065 --> 05:51.065
- Yeah.
- No, okay? don't.

05:51.067 --> 05:52.666
Look, I dropped out
for a reason.

05:52.668 --> 05:54.902
I do not want them
getting their hooks back in me.

05:54.904 --> 05:56.704
I don't care.

05:56.706 --> 05:58.639
You sound like a company man.

05:58.641 --> 06:02.476
Hey, you saved my life
back in Grozny.

06:02.478 --> 06:06.814
I'm saving yours now,
whether you like it or not.

06:14.524 --> 06:17.425
24 hours ago,
I didn't know Deckard was alive,

06:17.427 --> 06:19.560
and now you're asking me
to get him out of prison?

06:19.562 --> 06:22.163
He's incarcerated
in <i>penitenciario</i> seven

06:22.165 --> 06:24.032
under the alias George da Silva.

06:24.034 --> 06:26.134
Please don't ask.
Why would I ask?

06:26.136 --> 06:28.202
It's not like I'd get the truth.
Joan-

06:28.204 --> 06:30.204
I went back and looked
at the post-mission report

06:30.206 --> 06:31.639
you filed from Grozny
nine years back.

06:31.641 --> 06:33.207
You claimed Deckard disappeared.

06:33.209 --> 06:35.310
Didn't say anything about
you helping him cover it up.

06:35.312 --> 06:37.946
And I'm willing to take
responsibility for all that,

06:37.948 --> 06:40.214
but if we could just
look past it for now.

06:40.216 --> 06:42.183
I don't know why
I let you talk me

06:42.185 --> 06:43.384
into letting you go down there.

06:43.386 --> 06:46.988
Because you know how much
this means to me,

06:46.990 --> 06:49.023
and because you're the best.

06:49.025 --> 06:50.658
Well, it's gonna
take some time.

06:50.660 --> 06:53.294
Buenos Aires is still smarting
from the WikiLeaks revelations.

06:53.296 --> 06:55.563
They're being less than
cooperative these days.

06:55.565 --> 06:57.165
Understood. Any estimate?

06:57.167 --> 06:59.033
24 to 48 hours.

06:59.035 --> 07:00.568
Joan, that's too long.

07:00.570 --> 07:03.071
I'll push it through
as quickly as I can.

07:04.441 --> 07:05.573
It's gonna take a while.

07:05.575 --> 07:08.643
We need a place to lay low.

07:08.645 --> 07:11.446
Do you have access
to a safe house down here?

07:17.320 --> 07:19.520
Okay,
we've got to pull someone

07:19.522 --> 07:21.356
out of custody in Buenos Aires.

07:21.358 --> 07:23.257
Here's the pertinent
information.

07:23.259 --> 07:26.627
Get the ball rolling
with the Argentines.

07:26.629 --> 07:28.096
All right, everybody.

07:28.098 --> 07:29.564
Let's get started.

07:33.036 --> 07:35.603
Aleksandre Belenko
is still missing.

07:35.605 --> 07:37.438
It is our job to find him.

07:37.440 --> 07:41.042
I want everyone working
every angle they...

07:42.379 --> 07:45.046
Where's the DCS?

07:45.048 --> 07:47.315
He had to leave the campus,
ma'am.

07:47.317 --> 07:48.483
Did he say where to?

07:48.485 --> 07:50.318
No, ma'am.

08:14.811 --> 08:16.677
What do you want?

08:16.679 --> 08:18.780
Answers.

08:18.782 --> 08:20.715
About what?

08:20.717 --> 08:23.051
Why'd you do that to Sydney?

08:23.053 --> 08:27.355
I haven't been near her
since you blackmailed me.

08:27.357 --> 08:28.357
Wrong answer.

08:31.528 --> 08:32.727
Would you like to reconsider?

08:34.464 --> 08:36.364
I gave you everything
you asked for.

08:36.366 --> 08:38.698
You tried to kill Sydney

08:38.701 --> 08:40.668
but put her in the hospital
instead.

08:40.669 --> 08:42.403
I didn't!

08:42.405 --> 08:44.572
See, that's a nerve center,
okay?

08:44.574 --> 08:45.807
A little more pressure,

08:45.809 --> 08:47.542
you won't be able
to use your arm for a week.

08:47.544 --> 08:49.577
So go ahead, keep lying to me.

08:49.579 --> 08:51.179
I'm not lying!

08:51.181 --> 08:52.447
Please stop!

08:52.449 --> 08:54.582
Sounds like you want to lose
the other one too.

08:54.584 --> 08:57.085
I heard about the attack.

08:57.087 --> 08:58.853
It was yesterday, yes?

08:58.855 --> 09:01.456
I was with British ambassador
all day.

09:01.458 --> 09:02.824
Call him
if you don't believe me.

09:02.826 --> 09:04.459
I don't believe you!

09:04.461 --> 09:08.496
You used her to leverage me
against Belenko.

09:08.498 --> 09:10.465
What did you think
would happen to her?

09:10.467 --> 09:14.602
Of course Belenko
went after her.

09:14.604 --> 09:17.205
If I wasn't being protected
by Moscow,

09:17.207 --> 09:20.208
it would be me in the hospital--

09:20.210 --> 09:22.443
or worse.

09:22.445 --> 09:25.513
You're lucky she's still alive.

09:32.589 --> 09:34.122
What did Joan say about Tash?

09:34.124 --> 09:36.591
She's in Canada
waiting on her immunity.

09:36.593 --> 09:37.625
How's she holding up?

09:37.627 --> 09:39.594
Oh, you know Tash.
She's tough.

09:39.596 --> 09:41.362
Hold on a sec, guys.

09:41.364 --> 09:42.597
We got company ahead.

09:47.904 --> 09:50.872
And at three.

09:53.643 --> 09:54.675
And at nine.

09:54.677 --> 09:58.679
Uh-huh.
What's the move?

09:58.681 --> 10:00.248
Let's see
how sticky these guys are,

10:00.250 --> 10:01.250
shall we?

10:27.844 --> 10:29.510
<i>por alla.</i>

11:16.926 --> 11:19.560
Anyone want to hazard a guess
as to what that was about?

11:19.562 --> 11:20.628
I don't know.

11:20.630 --> 11:22.463
One explanation
might be that a PMC rolls

11:22.465 --> 11:24.532
into town looking into someone
like your friend,

11:24.534 --> 11:26.834
and the local spooks
might just take notice.

11:26.836 --> 11:28.402
They're back.

11:28.404 --> 11:29.570
We switched cars.

11:29.572 --> 11:31.272
How'd they get a bead
on us so quickly?

11:31.274 --> 11:32.907
We can't make any more moves
until we find out

11:32.909 --> 11:35.443
who these guys are
and what they're after.

11:58.768 --> 12:00.401
It's all clear.

12:00.403 --> 12:02.970
You think someone slipped
a tracker on us at immigration?

12:02.972 --> 12:04.372
Maybe.

12:04.374 --> 12:06.374
We need to get someplace
they can track less easily

12:06.376 --> 12:07.575
so I can do a search.

12:07.577 --> 12:10.578
I have an idea.
Head towards San Telmo.

12:10.580 --> 12:11.746
Okay.

12:45.081 --> 12:46.947
Patrick, call Interpol
in Frankfurt.

12:46.949 --> 12:48.616
Tell 'em I want
a full ballistics report

12:48.618 --> 12:50.885
from the crime scene
involving Olga Akarova.

12:50.887 --> 12:52.987
Have them compared to the one
we ran on Stephanie Banks.

12:52.989 --> 12:55.022
Right away. And, sir?

13:00.630 --> 13:02.330
I know. I know.

13:02.332 --> 13:04.532
No, I don't think you do.

13:07.770 --> 13:11.372
I just got a call from my man
inside the Russian embassy.

13:11.374 --> 13:12.773
Screw them.

13:12.775 --> 13:14.842
Stephanie's in the hospital
fighting for her life.

13:14.844 --> 13:16.911
I don't care
if the Russians are pissed off.

13:16.913 --> 13:18.546
But Mashkov didn't do it.

13:18.548 --> 13:20.514
He has an airtight alibi.

13:20.516 --> 13:22.450
I know that now.

13:22.452 --> 13:24.418
Are we any damn closer to
finding Belenko?

13:28.591 --> 13:30.658
I know you're hurting.

13:30.660 --> 13:33.627
I got this.

13:33.629 --> 13:35.763
Yeah?

13:35.765 --> 13:38.366
I got this.

13:38.368 --> 13:40.935
All right.

13:40.937 --> 13:43.637
I'll go smooth it over
with the Russians.

13:57.387 --> 13:58.919
This place is enormous.

13:58.921 --> 14:00.654
Yeah, that's the idea.

14:00.656 --> 14:03.891
If the tracker's here, it'll
take 'em a while to find us.

14:03.893 --> 14:05.793
How do you know
about this place?

14:05.795 --> 14:10.064
I did a semester
abroad here once upon a time.

14:10.066 --> 14:11.465
You never told me that.

14:11.467 --> 14:14.068
My host family lived
near Recoleta cemetery.

14:14.070 --> 14:15.469
It's beautiful.

14:24.981 --> 14:26.647
Wait here.
Wait here.

14:40.163 --> 14:41.462
Okay, you first.

14:41.464 --> 14:42.530
Take your shirt off.

14:42.532 --> 14:45.733
Okay.

14:45.735 --> 14:48.636
Your cane's just to your left.

14:48.638 --> 14:51.138
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

14:52.208 --> 14:54.842
Yeah, yeah.
Oh.

14:56.512 --> 14:58.879
Belenko really did a number
on you.

14:58.881 --> 15:02.183
Well, I consider myself lucky.

15:02.185 --> 15:03.784
If you hadn't shown up
when you did--

15:03.786 --> 15:04.819
Sorry it took so long.

15:04.821 --> 15:06.587
Hey, stop it.

15:06.589 --> 15:08.122
You came just in time.

15:19.202 --> 15:22.703
Hey, got your text.

15:22.705 --> 15:26.140
Just checking for trackers.

15:26.142 --> 15:28.075
I figured out
who was following us.

15:28.077 --> 15:30.945
Local cops--more specifically,
Special Ops Hawks.

15:30.947 --> 15:32.213
Why would they
be targeting us?

15:32.215 --> 15:33.581
I don't know,
but they're outside right now,

15:33.582 --> 15:34.948
and it's not
because they tailed me.

15:34.951 --> 15:37.685
- Well, how do you know that?
- Because I tailed them here.

15:37.687 --> 15:39.220
Oh, damn it.

15:39.222 --> 15:40.222
What?

15:44.260 --> 15:47.561
My eyes, Annie.

15:47.563 --> 15:49.663
Oh, my God.

15:49.665 --> 15:51.165
Belenko had me out for hours.

15:51.167 --> 15:53.033
He must've put these in then.

15:53.035 --> 15:54.602
Can you feel your eyes?

15:54.604 --> 15:56.537
Yeah, but I didn't notice
these, 'cause right now

15:56.539 --> 15:57.972
there isn't
a single inch of my body

15:57.974 --> 16:00.541
that doesn't feel like shit.

16:00.543 --> 16:01.775
This means the cops...

16:01.777 --> 16:02.943
Are working for Belenko.

16:02.945 --> 16:04.278
He's got the law
on his side now.

16:04.280 --> 16:06.113
He wanted us to escape,
me and Tash.

16:06.115 --> 16:07.214
Belenko set me up.

16:07.216 --> 16:09.016
There's no way
you could've known that.

16:09.018 --> 16:10.885
Damn it.
I led him right to Deckard.

16:20.230 --> 16:21.429
Stairs.

16:36.479 --> 16:38.179
-<i> Si, por alla.</i>
<i> - Vamos.</i>

16:40.717 --> 16:42.183
They're tracking the lenses.

16:42.185 --> 16:44.185
If they were able to trace
our steps to the prison,

16:44.187 --> 16:45.586
it won't take 'em long
to find Deckard.

16:45.588 --> 16:46.788
Even less time to kill him.

16:46.790 --> 16:48.189
Joan said
it was gonna take 'em

16:48.191 --> 16:49.824
a couple of days
to get him out.

16:49.826 --> 16:51.259
We don't have that kind
of time.

16:51.261 --> 16:52.727
We'll just have
to bust him out.

16:57.600 --> 17:01.235
Maxim, thank you so much
for meeting me.

17:01.237 --> 17:04.806
Our DCS is intensely ashamed
by his behavior this morning,

17:04.808 --> 17:08.276
and he asked me to share
his sincerest apologies.

17:08.278 --> 17:11.679
And I know it's a lot to ask,

17:11.681 --> 17:13.080
but if there's any way

17:13.083 --> 17:15.148
we could keep this
from becoming a legal issue--

17:15.151 --> 17:17.185
Say no more. It's done.

17:17.186 --> 17:20.855
Mr. Mashkov won't be
pressing any charges.

17:20.857 --> 17:22.457
Thank you, Maxim.

17:22.459 --> 17:24.692
Moscow wants you to know
that our relationship

17:24.694 --> 17:28.529
is more important to us
than this incident.

17:30.333 --> 17:33.134
<i> Na zdorov'ye.</i>

17:33.136 --> 17:34.602
<i>Na zdorov'ye.</i>

17:38.341 --> 17:42.510
We were blindsided
by Mr. Belenko's misdeeds.

17:42.512 --> 17:45.780
I'm aware in retrospect
it might look like the FSB

17:45.782 --> 17:47.682
was protecting him.

17:47.684 --> 17:51.152
We want you to know
we had nothing to do with this.

17:51.154 --> 17:53.187
I appreciate the candor,
Maxim.

17:53.189 --> 17:55.690
Can we expect your cooperation
in bringing Belenko to justice?

17:55.692 --> 17:56.692
Of course.

17:56.693 --> 17:58.159
We'll even take the lead,

17:58.161 --> 18:01.863
if you find it politically
expedient for us to do so.

18:04.601 --> 18:06.434
- Calder Michaels.
- Hey, it's me.

18:06.436 --> 18:07.602
I just spoke with Gomelsky.

18:07.604 --> 18:10.471
The Mashkov situation's
going away.

18:10.473 --> 18:12.206
That's great. Thank you.

18:12.208 --> 18:13.441
Funny thing is,
I didn't have to

18:13.443 --> 18:14.809
work that hard
to make it happen.

18:14.811 --> 18:17.812
He was bending over backwards
to smooth things over,

18:17.814 --> 18:20.314
even offered to help
find Belenko for us.

18:20.316 --> 18:22.750
Okay,
what's the Russians' play here?

18:22.752 --> 18:25.219
I think Belenko knows
more than they want him to know,

18:25.221 --> 18:29.690
and I think they'd prefer him
dead rather than alive.

18:32.862 --> 18:34.362
Just did a recon
of the perimeter.

18:34.364 --> 18:35.663
It looks like we lost the tail.

18:35.665 --> 18:38.366
Nice to have a second
safe house when you need it.

18:38.368 --> 18:39.834
How many of these
do you have access to?

18:39.836 --> 18:41.736
Let's hope we don't have
to find out.

18:41.738 --> 18:42.837
Where are we?

18:42.839 --> 18:45.473
Joan had techs
on the schematics of the prison.

18:45.475 --> 18:48.342
When this was built, it was
built over the existing water

18:48.344 --> 18:49.544
and sewer grid.

18:49.546 --> 18:51.412
So you're saying
there's a way out?

18:51.414 --> 18:53.414
Yeah, if you can access it.

18:53.416 --> 18:56.250
This is a two-man job for sure.

18:56.252 --> 18:58.719
Well,
I'll need to get in there.

18:58.721 --> 19:00.288
Get in? What do you mean?

19:00.290 --> 19:02.223
I'll need to get arrested
and break Deckard out.

19:02.225 --> 19:03.524
Oh, no way.

19:03.526 --> 19:04.959
Auggie just said
it was a two-man job.

19:04.961 --> 19:07.728
Otherwise it won't work.
Incoming call. Tash.

19:07.730 --> 19:10.698
Hello.
Tash.

19:10.700 --> 19:12.867
Slow down. Slow down.

19:12.869 --> 19:14.869
What you want to do--
it's too risky.

19:14.871 --> 19:16.404
I mean,
what if we can't get you out?

19:16.406 --> 19:18.639
I'll get out.

19:18.641 --> 19:19.874
You don't have
to do this for me.

19:19.876 --> 19:21.742
Who says I'm doing it for you?

19:26.883 --> 19:29.617
We doing this?

19:29.619 --> 19:31.519
It's a go.

19:31.521 --> 19:34.388
You said you warned Deckard
that there was a hit out on him,

19:34.390 --> 19:37.525
so he'll need some way
of knowing that I come in peace.

19:37.527 --> 19:38.926
Yeah.

19:41.598 --> 19:43.931
Try 13-8-7 Mayflower.

19:43.933 --> 19:45.967
It's the SOS we used
over the numbers station.

19:45.969 --> 19:47.568
All right.

19:47.570 --> 19:50.571
Let's just hope that
I get thrown in the same jail.

19:50.573 --> 19:52.740
Who was the cop
that busted Deckard?

19:52.742 --> 19:54.875
What did Carmona say
his name was?

19:54.877 --> 19:56.544
Sosa.

19:56.546 --> 19:59.847
If this hail Mary is
gonna work, he's our best shot.

20:06.022 --> 20:08.756
One second,
I'm just reading a text.

20:11.661 --> 20:13.494
In English.
I can't understand you.

21:17.527 --> 21:18.693
I don't know you, man.

21:18.695 --> 21:19.794
13.

21:23.466 --> 21:24.665
You're here to kill me.

21:24.667 --> 21:26.634
I'm here to spring you.

21:26.636 --> 21:29.036
Auggie sent me.
I don't know no Auggie.

21:29.038 --> 21:30.771
Shit.

21:30.773 --> 21:32.873
13-8-7 Mayflower.

21:32.875 --> 21:33.875
You know that?

21:37.480 --> 21:38.612
Okay, so what's the plan?

21:38.614 --> 21:40.648
We got to work together, man.

21:40.650 --> 21:43.351
We've got to make this fight
look a little less one-sided.

21:47.390 --> 21:49.557
Come on!

21:58.068 --> 22:00.101
How's it going?

22:00.103 --> 22:01.269
I hacked the encryption

22:01.271 --> 22:03.438
to get access
to the prison intercom system,

22:03.440 --> 22:04.739
so we've got ears in there.

22:04.741 --> 22:07.341
- Anything yet?
- No.

22:10.447 --> 22:12.747
It isn't easy being
on this side of things.

22:12.749 --> 22:16.818
Waiting around while someone
you care about's in danger?

22:16.820 --> 22:19.187
No, it isn't easy.

22:23.426 --> 22:28.162
He's a stand-up guy,
that McQuaid.

22:28.164 --> 22:30.264
Well, he's stubborn.
That's for sure.

22:32.702 --> 22:34.702
All the best ones are.

22:40.643 --> 22:41.809
Joan, hello?

22:41.811 --> 22:43.344
Annie, I'm glad I caught you.

22:43.346 --> 22:44.645
Joan, I've got Auggie
right here,

22:44.647 --> 22:46.214
if you want me to hand him off.

22:46.216 --> 22:48.649
No, I want to talk to you,
actually.

22:48.651 --> 22:51.486
Listen, I know Auggie
would fall on a grenade

22:51.488 --> 22:53.354
to save his friend,
but to be honest with you,

22:53.356 --> 22:55.623
Deckard's safety isn't
the only thing in play here.

22:55.625 --> 22:56.657
Meaning what?

22:56.659 --> 22:58.192
I have a favor to ask.

22:58.194 --> 23:00.461
Should you cross paths
with Belenko,

23:00.463 --> 23:03.297
it would be helpful
if you could capture him alive.

23:03.299 --> 23:04.665
You want him alive?

23:04.667 --> 23:06.868
The Russians have reversed
their position on him.

23:06.870 --> 23:08.202
From what to what?

23:08.204 --> 23:09.904
From protecting him
to wanting him dead,

23:09.906 --> 23:11.639
which means
he's incredibly valuable,

23:11.641 --> 23:13.541
even more so than we thought.

23:13.543 --> 23:16.477
You understand
we're trying to avoid Belenko?

23:16.479 --> 23:19.347
I know it's a lot to ask,
but...

23:19.349 --> 23:22.550
It's what we need.

23:22.552 --> 23:23.918
It's a fluid situation here,
Joan.

23:23.920 --> 23:26.487
I'll make the best decision
I can in the moment.

23:26.489 --> 23:28.823
I understand.

23:28.825 --> 23:30.291
Thank you, Annie.

23:32.829 --> 23:35.229
Annie.

23:35.231 --> 23:37.765
The guards are saying
there was a fight in the yard.

23:37.767 --> 23:39.800
They just broke it up--
two <i> gueros.</i>

23:39.802 --> 23:41.636
They should be in the infirmary
by now.

23:41.638 --> 23:42.770
Go.

24:35.225 --> 24:37.391
<i>hola?</i>

25:19.569 --> 25:21.802
I need to use the pisser.

25:21.804 --> 25:23.537
<i>No, no entiendo.</i>

25:23.539 --> 25:25.273
Uh,<i>baño.</i>

25:25.275 --> 25:27.041
Oh,<i>baño.</i>

25:27.043 --> 25:28.043
<i> Guardia.</i>

25:33.383 --> 25:34.515
<i> Puedes llevar?</i>

25:34.517 --> 25:35.916
<i> Gracias.</i>

25:53.536 --> 25:55.503
Hey,
where the hell is he going?

25:55.505 --> 25:58.439
Oh, your mother's waiting for
me downstairs for a conjugal.

25:58.441 --> 25:59.473
I'll kill him!

26:48.591 --> 26:50.391
You good?

26:50.393 --> 26:53.794
Yeah.

26:53.796 --> 26:54.895
Shh.

27:30.933 --> 27:32.400
<i> - Esta bien?</i>
<i> - Todo bien.</i>

27:32.402 --> 27:35.169
<i>Muy bien.</i>

27:57.560 --> 27:59.794
- Annie.
- We're running out of time.

27:59.796 --> 28:01.695
Belenko just arrived
with the Hawks.

28:01.697 --> 28:03.497
We got to get a warning
to our guys.

28:03.499 --> 28:04.899
It's too late for that, Annie.

28:04.901 --> 28:06.901
I can't just sit here
and wait.

28:06.903 --> 28:08.536
There's got to be some way
to warn them.

28:08.538 --> 28:12.706
Your position is still secure,
correct?

28:12.708 --> 28:13.808
Yeah, for now.

28:13.810 --> 28:16.577
Then we stick with the plan.

28:16.579 --> 28:17.711
All right.

28:39.402 --> 28:41.202
I thought you said
there was a way out of here.

28:41.204 --> 28:43.438
Hey, hey. Here.

28:53.616 --> 28:54.616
<i>Puerta.</i>

29:30.153 --> 29:31.219
<i> Esta trabada.</i>

30:06.723 --> 30:09.190
Wait, wait.

30:30.380 --> 30:31.512
Ryan.

30:38.288 --> 30:40.621
It worked.

30:40.623 --> 30:43.491
What'd I tell you?
It's a two-man job.

30:58.174 --> 31:00.241
I saw Belenko.
Where?

31:00.243 --> 31:01.609
Back there with the cops.

31:01.611 --> 31:03.244
Wait, wait, you said
you saw Belenko,

31:03.246 --> 31:04.445
the guy who's got a hit out
on us?

31:04.447 --> 31:05.847
- Yeah.
- Let's go back and get him.

31:05.849 --> 31:08.649
Look, the only place
you are going is out of here.

31:08.651 --> 31:10.751
Look, what kind of chicken
shit detail is this, man?

31:10.753 --> 31:11.819
Hey, how about a bit
of gratitude?

31:11.820 --> 31:12.886
Let's go.

31:48.625 --> 31:50.491
Did everybody make it?

31:50.493 --> 31:51.826
Yeah, we all made it.

31:51.828 --> 31:52.894
Deckard.

31:52.896 --> 31:54.295
Yeah, I guess we're even now

31:54.297 --> 31:55.297
on the life-saving thing.

31:55.298 --> 31:56.697
- Yeah, I guess so.
- Hey. Oh.

31:56.699 --> 31:58.599
- Get in the car. We got to go.
- We'll be right behind you.

31:58.601 --> 32:01.369
We'll meet you at the tarmac.
Yeah.

32:01.371 --> 32:03.771
Hey.

32:03.773 --> 32:06.240
You want to go back
and get Belenko, don't you?

32:12.749 --> 32:14.382
Only if you agree.

32:14.384 --> 32:15.683
We make this decision together.

32:15.685 --> 32:17.518
What's there to decide?

32:17.520 --> 32:18.920
I'm in. Let's do this.

32:25.428 --> 32:28.796
What was that for?

32:28.798 --> 32:30.932
I love you.

32:30.934 --> 32:33.234
I love you too.

32:37.774 --> 32:39.207
We can't go back and get him,

32:39.209 --> 32:43.477
but there might be a way
to get him to come to us.

33:19.482 --> 33:20.982
Wait in the car, sir, please.

33:20.984 --> 33:23.384
We'll bring him right back
to you.

33:49.812 --> 33:50.812
Put that out.

34:19.574 --> 34:20.741
<i>Vamos. Vamos.</i>

34:54.877 --> 34:56.777
Hey. Phone.

35:00.983 --> 35:03.951
In case anyone's tracking him.

35:11.527 --> 35:12.527
Hands.

35:15.765 --> 35:17.064
They're still behind us.

35:17.066 --> 35:19.367
You have to love
Latin American cops.

35:19.369 --> 35:21.869
They're so receptive to bribery.

35:21.871 --> 35:23.971
Good luck trying
to outrun these guys.

35:23.973 --> 35:25.539
Shut your face.

35:43.893 --> 35:47.862
I'm gonna run this.

35:47.864 --> 35:49.096
Hold on.

36:20.029 --> 36:22.463
Out. Come on.

36:22.465 --> 36:23.465
Come on! Come on!

36:27.103 --> 36:28.436
Come on. Come on.
Move!

36:28.438 --> 36:29.470
Go, go, go, go, go.

36:41.117 --> 36:43.217
If you make a sound,
I'll kill you.

36:43.219 --> 36:45.520
<i>Vamos, vamos, vamos.</i>

36:50.994 --> 36:52.193
Go, go, go, go, go!

36:56.633 --> 36:57.699
Okay, let's go.

37:00.603 --> 37:03.571
Come on.

37:20.991 --> 37:23.291
Thank you for everything.

37:23.293 --> 37:24.659
Send me an address
I can reach you at,

37:24.661 --> 37:25.661
I'll bill my time.

37:27.197 --> 37:28.463
Come on, Annie. Pick up.

37:30.567 --> 37:32.066
Annie, it's me. Where are you?

37:32.068 --> 37:33.735
You were supposed
to be in our rear view mirror.

37:33.737 --> 37:34.737
Check in.

37:34.738 --> 37:36.304
They probably
went after Belenko,

37:36.306 --> 37:37.638
which is
what we should be doing.

37:37.640 --> 37:41.309
You are going back home until
we can guarantee your safety.

37:41.311 --> 37:43.044
- Right this way, sir.
- Hey, no.

37:43.046 --> 37:44.312
No frickin' way, man.

37:44.314 --> 37:46.114
Deckard,
stop pushing back on this.

37:46.116 --> 37:47.515
I'll join you as soon as I can.

37:47.517 --> 37:49.250
I've been given
specific instructions.

37:49.252 --> 37:52.620
Mr. Anderson's to be
escorted home as well.

37:52.622 --> 37:54.122
What? Wait a minute.

37:54.124 --> 37:56.157
I got to make a phone call.
Hey, screw this, Auggie.

37:56.159 --> 38:00.094
I say we say and hunt him down,
get him before he gets us.

38:01.131 --> 38:02.397
- Yeah?
- Yeah, Joan. Good.

38:02.399 --> 38:04.399
I'm glad I got you.
We have a problem down here.

38:04.401 --> 38:06.134
Will you tell this guy
it's all right for me

38:06.136 --> 38:07.468
to stay here and run
the extraction?

38:07.470 --> 38:10.104
- No.
- No? Annie's still here.

38:10.106 --> 38:11.339
Belenko's on the ground.

38:11.341 --> 38:13.174
As much as you care
about Deckard's safety,

38:13.176 --> 38:14.176
I care about yours.

38:14.177 --> 38:15.177
Complain all you like,

38:15.178 --> 38:16.411
but those men are
wrapping you up

38:16.413 --> 38:17.478
and bringing you back home.

38:17.480 --> 38:19.547
- But, Joan--
- Bye, Auggie.

38:20.750 --> 38:21.816
You ready now?

38:21.818 --> 38:23.718
Come on, Auggie.
Dude, we can do this.

38:28.324 --> 38:31.292
Like you said,

38:31.294 --> 38:32.693
I'm a company man.

38:38.068 --> 38:40.535
Let's go.
All right.

38:40.537 --> 38:41.537
Let's go.

38:57.487 --> 38:58.719
She's stable,

38:58.721 --> 39:00.621
but the truth is,
the longer she's unconscious,

39:00.623 --> 39:02.757
the less likely
it is she'll recover.

39:11.701 --> 39:13.101
Excuse me.

39:15.271 --> 39:16.637
Yeah?

39:16.639 --> 39:19.574
The ballistics are back from
Frankfurt like you requested.

39:19.576 --> 39:21.175
- What do we got?
- You were right.

39:21.177 --> 39:23.744
The bullet came from the same
gun that killed Olga Akarova.

39:23.746 --> 39:25.746
It was Allen Langer.

39:25.748 --> 39:27.348
Belenko's guy.

39:27.350 --> 39:29.617
And get this, an image from
a gas station security camera

39:29.619 --> 39:31.886
places him in West Virginia
less than three hours ago.

39:31.888 --> 39:34.155
I want a search team
scrambled stat.

39:34.157 --> 39:35.623
Joan's already taken care
of that, sir.

39:35.625 --> 39:37.492
They'll be mission-ready
in 30 minutes.

39:37.494 --> 39:41.729
Tell 'em I'm on my way--
not to leave without me.

39:53.376 --> 39:55.376
I'm not getting
any cell reception here.

40:04.220 --> 40:07.155
They probably shut down
whatever cell towers are nearby.

40:09.826 --> 40:12.160
I'll make a deal with you.

40:12.162 --> 40:14.595
You tell me
where Auggie and Deckard are,

40:14.597 --> 40:16.164
and I'll make sure
they don't hurt you

40:16.166 --> 40:19.500
too badly before they kill you.

40:19.502 --> 40:22.904
Your money might not buy
as much friendship as you think.

40:22.906 --> 40:24.238
This is Argentina.

40:24.240 --> 40:26.507
The exchange rate's
working in my favor.

40:26.509 --> 40:28.442
Let's keep moving.

40:47.864 --> 40:49.730
Annie.

40:56.839 --> 40:59.540
What the hell is that?

40:59.542 --> 41:01.776
That is a message.

41:01.778 --> 41:03.811
The Russians want me dead.
