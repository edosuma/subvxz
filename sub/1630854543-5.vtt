WEBVTT

00:02.920 --> 00:03.960
ROGER:  Lyra.

00:03.960 --> 00:06.560
LYRA: When I was asleep, Roger spoke
to me.  You have to help me.

00:06.560 --> 00:07.960
Will, I think we should go there.

00:07.960 --> 00:09.880
Go where?
To the land of the dead.

00:09.880 --> 00:11.200
This is it!

00:12.680 --> 00:14.840
PAN:  Lyra, wait!

00:14.840 --> 00:18.120
You will deliver my message
to Metatron.

00:18.120 --> 00:19.320
SCREAMING

00:19.320 --> 00:21.640
I...am...

00:21.640 --> 00:22.880
..here!

00:22.880 --> 00:25.240
SCREAMING CONTINUES

00:25.240 --> 00:28.000
Tell the cardinal
that Mrs Coulter is back.

00:28.000 --> 00:31.560
All that matters is the child.
My...child.

00:31.560 --> 00:34.800
Eden fell when Eve was tempted.

00:34.800 --> 00:38.120
Somewhere out there
is a tempter, a serpent.

00:40.760 --> 00:42.160
Ngau.

00:42.160 --> 00:44.160
What are we working on here?

00:44.160 --> 00:47.840
MACPHAIL:  You are quite sure
the bomb will find the girl?

00:47.840 --> 00:49.600
DR COOPER:  There are
codes within us.

00:49.600 --> 00:52.880
We use these
to aim this device.

00:52.880 --> 00:55.400
The hair will want to be made whole.

00:55.400 --> 00:57.680
ROKE:  You came here
to protect her, but instead

00:57.680 --> 00:59.960
gave them the fuse to a bomb.

00:59.960 --> 01:02.080
I never got a chance
to say goodbye to Roger.

01:02.080 --> 01:03.800
PAN:  It's not too late
to turn around.

01:03.800 --> 01:05.280
You were on my side.

01:05.280 --> 01:07.160
I thought I was by your side.

01:07.160 --> 01:09.560
I don't know how you took
the hair from us.

01:09.560 --> 01:11.720
We still have enough left

01:11.720 --> 01:14.520
to kill Lyra Belacqua.

01:14.520 --> 01:17.960
You will be the bullet
when we sever your daemon.

01:17.960 --> 01:20.880
No passage. Not for him.
But he is me.

01:20.880 --> 01:22.800
If you come, he must stay.

01:22.800 --> 01:24.600
I can't betray Roger.

01:25.760 --> 01:28.120
You've chosen Roger over me.

01:28.120 --> 01:30.160
But I have to do this.

01:31.800 --> 01:33.960
SHE SCREAMS

01:42.240 --> 01:44.000
MARY:  What are you?

01:44.000 --> 01:45.240
THE CAVE:  Angels.

01:50.560 --> 01:52.480
You must play the serpent.

01:53.600 --> 01:56.200
You have been preparing
for this

01:56.200 --> 01:57.760
as long as you have lived.

01:59.240 --> 02:00.520
Save the girl...

02:01.680 --> 02:03.400
..and the boy.

02:03.400 --> 02:05.000
SHE SIGHS

02:07.200 --> 02:09.680
Froom.

02:09.680 --> 02:11.360
What am I doing?

02:14.160 --> 02:15.640
I'm following a talking elephant.

02:42.640 --> 02:44.000
Wow.

02:56.040 --> 02:57.760
Seriously?

03:06.080 --> 03:07.720
TRUMPETING

03:07.720 --> 03:09.920
SQUAWKING

03:58.640 --> 04:00.480
TRUMPETS

04:16.040 --> 04:17.080
That's you.

04:18.520 --> 04:19.880
Atal.

04:22.320 --> 04:23.400
Mary.

04:25.080 --> 04:28.720
There must be a reason
why I'm here, don't you think, Atal?

04:40.360 --> 04:42.480
These are from the trees?

04:42.480 --> 04:45.080
They're very...oily.

05:03.160 --> 05:06.480
Nguli. Sraf.

05:07.840 --> 05:09.960
SHE PRACTISES WORDS SOFTLY

05:12.280 --> 05:14.000
Pi mu...

05:22.320 --> 05:24.520
DISTANT TRUMPETING

05:25.960 --> 05:28.320
Chuh huhn.

05:28.320 --> 05:30.720
May-may.

05:31.760 --> 05:33.240
Maeri.

05:47.320 --> 05:50.560
I've heard you and the others
talk about Sraf.

05:50.560 --> 05:52.640
What is Sraf?

05:59.720 --> 06:02.320
Chuni? Sleep?

06:04.080 --> 06:07.480
Maya? Maya chuni nala?

06:20.200 --> 06:23.400
I've been seeing more
dead seedpods around.

06:24.800 --> 06:26.840
Don't you need the oil they produce?

06:36.560 --> 06:39.760
Mughe mea na mia...

06:40.840 --> 06:41.880
Um...

06:43.120 --> 06:44.880
...to learn...

06:44.880 --> 06:48.680
Chikkella mughe rere ni xuap e?

06:48.680 --> 06:53.720
Rere ni, xua mu ia
ni Sraf e chikkella nala.

06:56.080 --> 07:00.600
Maeri, ku lu xua na umi tattin
mae ech.

09:00.480 --> 09:03.120
What does it feel like
being this far away from him?

09:04.160 --> 09:05.560
From Pan?

09:07.640 --> 09:10.280
It's like an iron hand
is gripped round my heart

09:10.280 --> 09:12.960
and is yanking it out
between my ribs.

09:15.600 --> 09:17.120
And it's mental, too, right?

09:18.160 --> 09:22.400
As if some private, secret thing
has been dragged out into the open?

09:24.040 --> 09:25.480
Yeah.

09:28.160 --> 09:30.440
You know, you always said
I must have a daemon,

09:30.440 --> 09:31.600
and I never believed you.

09:33.240 --> 09:35.880
Now it feels like
I've known her my whole life.

09:42.840 --> 09:44.360
Maybe she's with Pan now.

09:46.840 --> 09:50.520
Hey. We're going to get back
to our daemons.

09:50.520 --> 09:52.640
I know we are.

09:52.640 --> 09:53.760
We've got the knife.

09:55.400 --> 09:57.040
And we've got each other.

09:58.400 --> 10:00.680
And for some reason, I trust you.

10:14.880 --> 10:16.320
How much longer?

10:16.320 --> 10:18.680
As long as it needs to take.

10:18.680 --> 10:21.400
Time does as it pleases
down here.

10:23.360 --> 10:25.080
Don't be scared now.

10:25.080 --> 10:27.840
I'm not scared. HE CHUCKLES

10:27.840 --> 10:32.000
I've had warriors and assassins
and war generals on this boat

10:32.000 --> 10:33.720
all telling me the same.

10:35.480 --> 10:37.120
None's come back.

10:40.120 --> 10:41.960
Apologies, ladies and gentlemen.

10:43.040 --> 10:45.120
Well, best of luck to you.

10:46.640 --> 10:48.400
You're just going to
leave us here?

10:48.400 --> 10:50.960
Well, I can't go beyond
this point, I'm afraid.

10:57.080 --> 10:58.640
Thank you.

11:01.680 --> 11:03.400
Wait.

11:03.400 --> 11:05.400
If my daemon's still at the jetty,

11:05.400 --> 11:07.680
can you give him a message?

11:07.680 --> 11:09.640
I can tell you now, he won't be.

11:21.840 --> 11:23.280
How do we know where...

11:32.680 --> 11:34.080
No turning back, I guess.

11:36.480 --> 11:37.600
No turning back.

12:30.120 --> 12:32.320
I've told you I'm not eating your
putrid food

12:32.320 --> 12:35.440
and if you try to force me,
I'll bite your fingers off.

12:38.280 --> 12:41.080
Huh! I don't doubt for a second
that you would.

12:46.760 --> 12:49.200
I thought you'd scuttled
back to Asriel

12:49.200 --> 12:51.320
with news of my humiliation.

12:51.320 --> 12:53.560
As much as he might enjoy
this humiliation,

12:53.560 --> 12:55.760
I don't believe Asriel
wants you dead.

12:55.760 --> 12:57.200
And neither do I.

12:59.880 --> 13:02.160
Dr Cooper is readying the bomb.

13:02.160 --> 13:05.600
I've got enough poison to fell
the guards outside this cell,

13:05.600 --> 13:07.680
but no more than that.

13:07.680 --> 13:10.240
How does she seem? Dr Cooper?

13:10.240 --> 13:11.920
Frightened.

13:11.920 --> 13:14.480
It seems to me
she's acting against her will.

13:17.000 --> 13:18.600
We stay here.

13:18.600 --> 13:20.160
The bomb is ready.

13:20.160 --> 13:23.920
Lyra's hair is in a chamber
inside its body.

13:23.920 --> 13:26.520
They intend to sever you
from your daemon.

13:29.680 --> 13:31.160
Good.

13:38.840 --> 13:40.480
It's not made of rock.

13:48.200 --> 13:49.760
It's made of people's things.

14:05.240 --> 14:06.280
Lyra...

14:12.760 --> 14:13.920
The dead.

14:17.640 --> 14:20.080
WHISPERING

14:35.920 --> 14:37.360
Are you alive?

14:38.720 --> 14:40.440
Yeah.

14:40.440 --> 14:42.120
We're visitors.

14:42.120 --> 14:44.200
WOMAN:  You shouldn't have come
to this place.

14:44.200 --> 14:45.920
Go back while you still can.

14:45.920 --> 14:49.520
Why were you guys hiding?  They don't
like it if we talk to each other.

14:49.520 --> 14:52.000
Who don't? CREAKING

14:52.000 --> 14:54.920
SNARLING WHISPERS:  They're listening.

14:54.920 --> 14:57.240
SNARLS REVERBERATE

14:59.240 --> 15:01.400
I need your help.

15:01.400 --> 15:03.280
I'm looking for someone.

15:03.280 --> 15:05.360
Roger Parslow.

15:05.360 --> 15:06.800
I must warn you,

15:06.800 --> 15:08.680
he might not want
to see you.

15:10.040 --> 15:12.280
Do you come from a world
with daemons?

15:13.480 --> 15:14.680
Yeah.

15:16.880 --> 15:18.840
My daemon's name is Pan.

15:19.880 --> 15:22.280
Mine was called Sandling.

15:24.680 --> 15:27.800
He used to think he'd be a bird...

15:27.800 --> 15:31.560
...but I hoped he wouldn't,
cos I liked him all furry.

15:32.600 --> 15:36.080
My Castor used to curl up
in my hand and go to sleep.

15:36.080 --> 15:37.720
CHILD:  Mine was called Matapan.

15:37.720 --> 15:39.560
LOUD SCREECHING

15:41.680 --> 15:43.200
Hey.

15:43.200 --> 15:45.480
Please, could you help us?

15:45.480 --> 15:47.040
Maybe.

15:47.040 --> 15:49.000
Be careful.

15:49.000 --> 15:50.840
They will attract attention.

16:32.920 --> 16:35.400
To touch another's daemon
is forbidden, is it not?

16:40.160 --> 16:41.800
How dare you enter unannounced?

16:45.040 --> 16:49.000
Do I have to remind you
to whom it is you answer?

16:51.800 --> 16:53.880
I answer to the Authority.

17:07.440 --> 17:10.720
Get out of my sight and never
question me again.

17:23.560 --> 17:26.240
They must have been here
a long time.

17:28.640 --> 17:31.280
Does everyone who comes here
end up like this?

17:31.280 --> 17:33.440
Are you looking for someone, too?

17:34.720 --> 17:36.320
I'm just asking.

17:37.720 --> 17:41.800
When I first came here,
I was looking for someone.

17:41.800 --> 17:43.160
My sister.

17:44.320 --> 17:45.600
You never found her?

17:45.600 --> 17:48.120
I gave up pretty quickly.

17:48.120 --> 17:50.200
REVERBERATING SNARLING

17:50.200 --> 17:55.480
RASPING WHISPER:  You left your
sister all alone...

17:58.240 --> 17:59.840
I have to go back.

18:00.840 --> 18:03.160
Wait, no, we need you.
I'm sorry.

18:34.360 --> 18:35.600
ROGER:  Lyra...

18:35.600 --> 18:37.080
WHISPER:  Lyra...

18:40.040 --> 18:41.520
Hello?

18:41.520 --> 18:42.560
ROGER:  Lyra.

18:42.560 --> 18:44.600
RASPING WHISPER:  Lyra...

18:46.680 --> 18:47.760
Will?

18:50.360 --> 18:52.480
Will?
PAN:  Lyra!

18:52.480 --> 18:53.760
EERIE VOICE:  Lyra...

18:55.360 --> 18:56.800
Pan.

18:58.320 --> 19:00.600
Pan! You shouldn't be here.

19:02.080 --> 19:03.920
PAN:  It's what you wanted.

19:06.200 --> 19:07.840
How did you...

19:15.440 --> 19:16.920
Lyra!

19:19.480 --> 19:21.480
Excuse me. Excuse me.

19:25.600 --> 19:26.880
Where'd you go?

19:26.880 --> 19:28.800
PAN:  You left me on
the jetty to die.

19:28.800 --> 19:32.160
Don't say that. You know why
I had to do it.

19:32.160 --> 19:35.240
I've always known deep down
how selfish you are.

19:37.440 --> 19:39.680
You really believe
you're here for Roger?

19:40.920 --> 19:42.880
You already killed him.

19:42.880 --> 19:44.560
You came here for you.

19:44.560 --> 19:47.040
To soothe your guilt.

19:47.040 --> 19:48.240
To play the hero.

19:50.040 --> 19:52.520
This isn't real. You're not real.

19:52.520 --> 19:53.560
Will!

19:55.320 --> 19:58.080
SCREAMING: Will!

19:58.080 --> 19:59.280
Lyra!

20:04.360 --> 20:07.280
Whatever it was saying,
it wasn't true.

20:08.560 --> 20:09.920
You're a good person.

20:16.160 --> 20:17.720
This place is horrible.

20:21.760 --> 20:23.440
This can't be it, can it?

20:26.560 --> 20:28.600
Surely there has to be
some other place.

20:31.400 --> 20:34.120
This can't be where we
all go...forever.

20:49.480 --> 20:50.720
Roger.

20:53.320 --> 20:54.800
Roger!

20:57.960 --> 20:59.400
Roger?

21:01.280 --> 21:02.520
Roger?

21:20.760 --> 21:22.320
WHISPERS: Roger.

21:29.120 --> 21:30.280
It's me.

21:32.200 --> 21:33.240
I know.

21:38.000 --> 21:39.560
Roger bloody Parslow.

21:41.680 --> 21:43.200
It's your best friend.

21:45.440 --> 21:46.640
You came.

21:47.680 --> 21:50.000
You needed me.

21:50.000 --> 21:52.280
I've changed...

21:52.280 --> 21:53.760
..so much.

21:55.280 --> 21:57.160
You've changed, too.

21:59.960 --> 22:01.720
I missed you.

22:06.920 --> 22:08.120
I'm so sorry...

22:08.120 --> 22:09.520
..about everything.

22:13.640 --> 22:17.200
I should have let you go
with the Gyptians and the kids.

22:17.200 --> 22:19.320
I shouldn't have taken you
to Asriel.

22:19.320 --> 22:21.680
If I'd have let you go,
you wouldn't be here, would you?

22:21.680 --> 22:24.080
You'd be...
It wasn't your fault.

22:24.080 --> 22:25.720
I wanted to go with you.

22:40.120 --> 22:41.760
I do wish things were different.

22:52.760 --> 22:54.280
I'm Will.

23:06.120 --> 23:07.640
Roger, you can't stay here.

23:09.120 --> 23:12.840
Look, I'm going to break you
all out of here, I mean it.

23:14.080 --> 23:15.680
That's not possible.

23:16.800 --> 23:18.400
It is.

23:18.400 --> 23:19.720
It has to be.

23:19.720 --> 23:22.800
I mean, what they're making you
endure here, it's...it's not right.

23:22.800 --> 23:25.440
Look...

23:25.440 --> 23:26.680
..when you didn't come...

23:28.600 --> 23:30.680
..I lost all hope...

23:30.680 --> 23:33.120
..forever.

23:33.120 --> 23:34.760
I'm sorry.

23:34.760 --> 23:36.720
Please. It can be us together again.

23:36.720 --> 23:39.400
You and me again.  Stop it!

23:39.400 --> 23:42.640
You think I want to go back
to the real world?

23:42.640 --> 23:43.680
Like this?

23:57.720 --> 24:00.280
Lyra...
There's nothing you can say.

24:00.280 --> 24:01.720
Look, we can still help him!

24:02.760 --> 24:04.080
But he's right.

24:04.080 --> 24:06.360
We don't know what will happen
to him if we leave.

24:07.400 --> 24:09.600
It's a terrible idea.

24:09.600 --> 24:11.520
Look, you said this place
was awful, right?

24:11.520 --> 24:14.160
That no-one should be here.
It's like a prison.

24:17.640 --> 24:19.160
It's worse than a prison.

24:19.160 --> 24:21.240
So you're just going to give up
on him?

24:21.240 --> 24:24.280
Don't stop following your instincts.

24:24.280 --> 24:26.680
We have to try.
You promised Pan.

24:33.800 --> 24:35.680
Make a window.

24:35.680 --> 24:37.960
Where to?
Anywhere.

24:38.960 --> 24:40.360
We need to get out of here.

24:40.360 --> 24:43.560
I'll drag Roger through
if I have to.

24:43.560 --> 24:45.120
OK.

24:50.280 --> 24:52.000
METALLIC CLANK

24:52.000 --> 24:54.120

24:54.120 --> 24:56.120
Hmm.

24:56.120 --> 24:58.000
SCRAPING

24:58.000 --> 24:59.400
What?

25:02.680 --> 25:05.400
What's the matter?
It's not working.

25:10.600 --> 25:11.880
I can only feel rock.

25:15.280 --> 25:17.880
RASPING WHISPER:  What
kind of knife-bearer

25:17.880 --> 25:20.480
cannot use his own knife?

25:23.160 --> 25:25.840
One led by an ignorant child.

25:27.360 --> 25:29.680
LOW GROWLING

25:29.680 --> 25:35.160
What kind of son abandons
his own mother?

25:40.240 --> 25:43.240
We shall send her nightmares.

25:44.520 --> 25:48.960
We shall scream at her
in her sleep.

25:53.440 --> 26:00.840
You have destroyed the lives
of everyone you've ever cared for.

26:02.520 --> 26:05.480
You've come here for you,

26:05.480 --> 26:07.880
to feel special.

26:09.200 --> 26:12.160
If only Will had never met you.

26:15.320 --> 26:17.640

Listen to me.

RASPING SCREECHES

26:35.920 --> 26:37.600
Hey. They're gone.

26:39.040 --> 26:41.800
How?

26:41.800 --> 26:43.240
I just believed I could.

26:44.720 --> 26:46.720
I thought about us and...

26:48.960 --> 26:50.760
..everything we've been through.

26:52.240 --> 26:54.400
I didn't let them get into my head.

26:58.800 --> 27:01.240
The knife doesn't work here cos
we're too low down.

27:02.520 --> 27:03.840
We need to find higher ground.

27:11.320 --> 27:13.920
GOMEZ:  Your Grace.

27:13.920 --> 27:15.080
Please.

27:16.160 --> 27:18.400
I've thought of something
to show my contrition.

27:23.000 --> 27:26.000
By his mercy and your brilliance,

27:26.000 --> 27:27.920
evil will be struck down.

27:30.080 --> 27:32.040
But what of the serpent?

27:34.880 --> 27:38.040
Fra Pavel has deduced that
she's in another world.

27:38.040 --> 27:40.720
Who knows what depravity
she is capable of?

27:40.720 --> 27:43.840
What if I was to
track her down?

27:47.400 --> 27:49.200
Let me do it, I beg of you.

27:51.960 --> 27:54.320
I will allow you this task
for your penance.

27:55.360 --> 27:57.600
Father President, sir, it will be
the honour of my life.

27:58.920 --> 28:00.080
Mm.

28:03.640 --> 28:05.600
I will repay your faith.

28:35.520 --> 28:37.080
Mughe.

28:37.080 --> 28:38.600
Dgela.

28:38.600 --> 28:40.280
Ni.

28:41.560 --> 28:42.800
Dg-ni.

29:57.120 --> 29:59.120
I need a lens.

30:29.640 --> 30:31.480
Got it!

31:07.960 --> 31:10.040
It's Dust.

31:10.040 --> 31:11.920
Sraf is Dust.

31:11.920 --> 31:14.840

31:50.960 --> 31:52.800

32:29.960 --> 32:32.120
What do you remember about Jordan?

32:33.960 --> 32:35.640
You remember it, don't you?

32:38.240 --> 32:39.520
Jordan's gone.

32:41.960 --> 32:43.000
It can't be.

32:44.280 --> 32:45.800
I can see it perfectly.

32:47.000 --> 32:50.040
Every nook, every cranny,
every secret passageway.

32:51.440 --> 32:53.760
We know that place like the back
of our hands.

33:00.880 --> 33:03.200
Do you remember that time we snuck
into the wine cellar?

33:03.200 --> 33:05.160
We got covered in cobwebs
and dust.

33:06.680 --> 33:08.560
I don't even know
how we got in there.

33:09.760 --> 33:11.280
ECHOING:  Lyra, will you wait?!

33:14.640 --> 33:16.040
We had the porter's key.

33:19.840 --> 33:21.320
We did.

33:23.760 --> 33:25.680
We found that ancient bottle
of Tokay.

33:26.760 --> 33:28.600
It smelt horrible.

33:28.600 --> 33:30.160
It tasted horrible, too.

33:31.840 --> 33:34.000
We couldn't stop laughing for hours.

33:34.000 --> 33:36.920
Wouldn't have got away with that if
we had parents, would we?

33:36.920 --> 33:38.440
No. BOTH LAUGH

33:52.200 --> 33:53.240
And the roof?

33:55.520 --> 33:56.840
The roof...

33:59.120 --> 34:01.360
It was so high up there.

34:07.760 --> 34:09.760
Remember that rook with
the broken leg?

34:10.800 --> 34:12.880
Yeah. We nursed it back to life.

34:15.120 --> 34:17.320
Lyra...

34:17.320 --> 34:18.800
They want to listen.

34:39.880 --> 34:42.000
MURMURING

35:08.920 --> 35:10.320
My name is Lyra.

35:10.320 --> 35:12.080
I came here looking
for my friend.

35:13.520 --> 35:16.720
His death was unfair, so I thought
he shouldn't be here.

35:16.720 --> 35:19.000
What I didn't realise is that
none of you should be here.

35:20.920 --> 35:23.720
This isn't life after death,
this is a prison camp.

35:31.360 --> 35:32.960
Hi, guys. I'm Will.

35:34.240 --> 35:36.920
I have a knife that can
cut through worlds.

35:38.560 --> 35:42.480
If you follow us, I'm hoping that
I can use it

35:42.480 --> 35:44.400
to get you guys out of here. DISTANT SCREECHES

35:44.400 --> 35:46.760
I can't make you any promises,
but I'll try.

35:46.760 --> 35:50.040
I know you're afraid,
but we can get out of here.

35:50.040 --> 35:51.560
What'll happen to us if we leave?

35:54.120 --> 35:56.400
I don't know.  You don't know

35:56.400 --> 35:59.080
if I will or won't be
able to see my son again?

35:59.080 --> 36:00.840
We can't know until it happens.

36:00.840 --> 36:03.120
I'm not going to lie or pretend. DISTANT SCREECHING

36:04.520 --> 36:06.280
But in here, it's just thoughts.

36:07.440 --> 36:09.960
Out there, real things matter.

36:09.960 --> 36:11.480
HARPIES SNARL

36:11.480 --> 36:15.160
You think those creatures will just
allow us to leave?

36:15.160 --> 36:18.800
When we were alive,
they told us that when we died,

36:18.800 --> 36:20.360
we'd go to heaven.

36:20.360 --> 36:22.880
That's why so many of us
gave our lives

36:22.880 --> 36:27.360
and spent years in prayer
and silence,

36:27.360 --> 36:30.880
while all the joy of life
went to waste around us.

36:33.720 --> 36:37.120
I don't care what happens
to us when we leave.

36:37.120 --> 36:39.600
Anything is better than this.

36:39.600 --> 36:42.080

36:51.080 --> 36:53.200

36:53.200 --> 36:54.640
The girl!

36:57.640 --> 36:59.920
Lyra...

37:07.640 --> 37:08.800
Lyra.

37:10.280 --> 37:12.960
What were you saying before?

37:14.080 --> 37:17.040
Those stories, what were they?

37:17.040 --> 37:18.800
They were about the outside world.

37:20.000 --> 37:21.840
Do you remember your life before?

37:23.920 --> 37:25.880
Everything slips away.

37:28.720 --> 37:32.520
Will you tell us some stories,
so we can remember too?

37:33.800 --> 37:35.280
Real things.

37:36.880 --> 37:39.080
LOW SNARLING

37:41.360 --> 37:42.520
OK.

37:42.520 --> 37:46.200
So, I used to live in this place
called Jordan College with Roger.

37:46.200 --> 37:49.160
It had these beautiful buildings
and these really high towers,

37:49.160 --> 37:51.360
which looked like they
could almost touch the sky.

37:58.080 --> 38:00.120
It had amazing hiding places.

38:00.120 --> 38:03.800
We used to race.  Through
the kitchen, down the stairs,

38:03.800 --> 38:05.240
back onto the roof...

38:05.240 --> 38:07.600
I won every time.  No, she didn't.

38:07.600 --> 38:09.400
You cheated every time.

38:10.640 --> 38:12.040
What else?

38:17.320 --> 38:19.520
Then I met Will.

38:19.520 --> 38:21.760
He made me an omelette.
I didn't know what one was,

38:21.760 --> 38:23.680
so I thought I'd make him one
in return.

38:23.680 --> 38:26.480
Which was funny
because she left the shells in.

38:28.320 --> 38:31.280
And Iorek.  The armoured bear.

38:31.280 --> 38:33.360
He has claws the size of your hand.

38:33.360 --> 38:35.160
Magnificent.

38:35.160 --> 38:37.280
When I first met him,
he'd lost his armour.

38:37.280 --> 38:39.680
But thanks to the alethiometer,
we managed to get it back.

38:39.680 --> 38:42.600
We went to the palace of the bears
in Svalbard and took on...

38:42.600 --> 38:45.360
VOICE FADES

40:43.520 --> 40:46.520
Is this really how things
are to end between you and I?

40:54.800 --> 40:56.760
What do you think will happen
after this?

40:58.000 --> 41:01.480
Do you really believe that
things are going to get better?

41:06.680 --> 41:10.360
Dr Cooper, these are not the wishes
of the Authority, you know that.

41:10.360 --> 41:13.600
These are the wishes
of a weak and dangerous man.

41:13.600 --> 41:17.400
And if he is prepared to kill me,
think what he might do to you.

41:24.200 --> 41:26.720
When we created
this technology together,

41:26.720 --> 41:29.880
you believed you were doing
the right thing.

41:31.440 --> 41:33.000
We all did.

41:34.880 --> 41:36.520
But we were wrong.

41:38.600 --> 41:40.280
This has to stop.

41:42.600 --> 41:44.880
DOOR OPENS

42:02.280 --> 42:06.800
I can scarcely believe this day has
arrived, Dr Cooper.

42:06.800 --> 42:09.760
You do not understand
this technology, Hugh.

42:09.760 --> 42:12.120
You are simply going
to blow up the Magisterium

42:12.120 --> 42:14.200
and everyone in it.

42:14.200 --> 42:16.480
Quite the contrary.

42:16.480 --> 42:19.280
Our conception is elegantly simple.

42:20.560 --> 42:22.440
The separation of
human and daemon...

42:22.440 --> 42:26.080
Do not explain my own
technology to me.

42:26.080 --> 42:28.960
It has evolved somewhat since
your original design.

42:30.680 --> 42:34.640
Our bomb is equipped with
a guidance mechanism.

42:34.640 --> 42:38.840
We will use the lock of
your daughter's hair to locate her

42:38.840 --> 42:41.680
and to destroy her on the spot.

42:41.680 --> 42:42.920
All in a moment.

42:44.880 --> 42:49.720
It is a thing of
divine precision and power,

42:49.720 --> 42:53.720
such an exquisite example of
the Authority's design.

42:53.720 --> 42:56.880
Such beauty in its order.

42:58.160 --> 43:00.320
You have lost your mind.

43:00.320 --> 43:01.640
You're sick!

43:03.880 --> 43:06.360
I urge you not to struggle.

43:06.360 --> 43:08.040
Go willingly,

43:08.040 --> 43:09.960
and this could be
your redemption.

43:09.960 --> 43:11.720
You truly think that?

43:13.560 --> 43:16.560
That he ordained all this?

43:16.560 --> 43:18.880
The Authority has not
forsaken you, Marisa.

43:21.320 --> 43:24.280
You still have time to repent.

43:24.280 --> 43:27.640
Let me give you
your final blessing.

43:27.640 --> 43:29.160
Keep...

43:30.440 --> 43:32.280
..your hands off me.

43:36.160 --> 43:38.240
There's too much blood on them
for that.

43:45.080 --> 43:46.640
Initiate the process.

43:54.120 --> 43:57.840
DISTANT: Through Iorek, we also met
my friend Lee, the aeronaut.

43:57.840 --> 44:00.320
I remember the first time
I went up in his balloon.

44:00.320 --> 44:03.880
It was so high up there, the
wind was pushing against my skin.

44:03.880 --> 44:06.760
If you looked over the edge,
you would feel dizzy,

44:06.760 --> 44:09.840
but you felt safe
with Mr Scoresby.

44:09.840 --> 44:12.040
He's the first grown-up
I ever trusted.

44:13.560 --> 44:18.160
Your stories have made us
feel alive again.

44:18.160 --> 44:25.280
I remember now what it was
to have warm flesh and senses.

44:29.720 --> 44:31.120
I will come with you.

44:32.880 --> 44:35.720
We...we will come with you.

45:59.600 --> 46:02.560
LEE:  Pardon me. Excuse me.
Coming through.

46:04.720 --> 46:06.080
Lyra?

46:08.040 --> 46:09.280
Lyra!

46:17.320 --> 46:18.400
You're alive.

46:20.040 --> 46:22.040
You're alive!

46:22.040 --> 46:24.120
Oh, kid, you really had me there.

46:25.320 --> 46:28.200
Lee...
You...

46:29.200 --> 46:31.960
Yeah. It's not as bad as it seems.

46:31.960 --> 46:33.240
How did you...?

46:33.240 --> 46:35.640
Some excited rifleman got lucky.

46:35.640 --> 46:38.360
It was over before it started,
I promise.

46:42.000 --> 46:45.200
It's fine. We're together now.

46:45.200 --> 46:47.560
Only for a little while.

46:47.560 --> 46:49.000
You don't belong here.

46:50.120 --> 46:51.800
And the word is out -

46:51.800 --> 46:54.160
some crazy kid's got a plan
to break us out of here.

46:59.360 --> 47:02.680
This is my friend Will. This is Lee.

47:02.680 --> 47:04.440
Balloon driver.

47:04.440 --> 47:07.080
Good to see you, kid.

47:07.080 --> 47:08.800
Will's going to get us out of here.

47:11.560 --> 47:13.320
With this, I hope.

47:14.760 --> 47:16.960
You found the knife-bearer.

47:16.960 --> 47:18.920
You beat the shaman to it.

47:18.920 --> 47:20.800
Lyra Silvertongue, just when
I thought

47:20.800 --> 47:23.120
you couldn't blow my little mind
enough times...

47:23.120 --> 47:25.880
We're looking for a higher
place so I can cut out of here.

47:25.880 --> 47:28.320
You go on ahead. There's some
stragglers in the back.

47:28.320 --> 47:31.200
I'll round them up for you.
I'll catch up.

47:31.200 --> 47:32.640
All right, folks, follow the lady!

47:32.640 --> 47:34.280
Follow the kid with the knife, yeah.

47:34.280 --> 47:35.840
You guys want to get out of here?

47:35.840 --> 47:37.560
You want to see the sky again?

47:37.560 --> 47:38.960
Let's go. Go that way.

47:38.960 --> 47:41.960
Follow the kid with the knife!
Let's go!

47:55.360 --> 47:58.520
On your knees
before the Authority, Alarbus.

48:04.680 --> 48:07.040
I have come with news, Regent.

48:07.040 --> 48:10.920
What news do you presume
could be of interest to me?

48:12.200 --> 48:14.720
I was captured.

48:14.720 --> 48:15.800
By humans.

48:17.080 --> 48:19.440
The mortal Lord Asriel has
formed a republic.

48:21.000 --> 48:23.920
He is harnessing technology...

48:23.920 --> 48:25.200
..to challenge you.

48:29.800 --> 48:31.200
Go on.

48:31.200 --> 48:33.080
They are able
to manipulate Dust.

48:34.280 --> 48:36.560
And Asriel spoke of
a new knife-bearer.

48:37.840 --> 48:40.320
That knife is of no consequence
to me.

48:44.760 --> 48:46.280
The bearer is a boy.

48:47.720 --> 48:49.880
He has not been corrupted
by the knife's power,

48:49.880 --> 48:51.520
like the bearers before him.

48:53.280 --> 48:55.520
Then...

48:55.520 --> 48:59.120
..perhaps it's time to send
these mortals...

48:59.120 --> 49:01.000
..a warning.

49:04.760 --> 49:06.760
MACHINE BUZZES

49:06.760 --> 49:08.720
PINGING

49:09.960 --> 49:13.760
You can keep spewing your doctrine
to justify killing a child,

49:13.760 --> 49:16.000
but it won't change anything.

49:17.760 --> 49:20.480
You're worshipping a lie!

49:20.480 --> 49:23.600
If she had only stayed with us

49:23.600 --> 49:27.000
and given her life to the Authority,
as she once intended,

49:27.000 --> 49:29.840
she would now be on the path
to the Kingdom.

49:36.000 --> 49:38.720
METALLIC PING Ah!  Ow!

49:41.800 --> 49:43.520
HUMMING

49:56.160 --> 49:59.360
You and others like you will never
be free!

49:59.360 --> 50:01.880
..through a veil
of corruption and tears...

50:01.880 --> 50:04.360
The Magisterium is an institution
that fears

50:04.360 --> 50:05.960
what it does not understand.

50:05.960 --> 50:08.160
..the stain of this child...

50:08.160 --> 50:09.720
And it turns on its own.

50:15.680 --> 50:17.160
BUZZING

50:21.440 --> 50:26.160
Be swift in your sweet wrath.

50:26.160 --> 50:29.520
Be mighty in your vengeance.

50:29.520 --> 50:32.080
HIGH-PITCHED BEEPING

50:32.080 --> 50:34.560
ALARM BLARES

50:53.280 --> 50:55.200
ALARM STOPS

51:04.480 --> 51:06.920
I will not...

51:06.920 --> 51:08.320
..be a part of this.

51:15.560 --> 51:17.600
FLUTTERING

51:23.840 --> 51:26.400
Are you obstructing me, Dr Cooper?

51:28.000 --> 51:31.720
I will not hurt her.

51:50.200 --> 51:51.560
No!

52:32.960 --> 52:34.280
No!

52:37.040 --> 52:39.280
HE GAGS

52:47.520 --> 52:49.120
HE SCREAMS

52:52.320 --> 52:54.320
BEEPING

52:54.320 --> 52:56.360
SHE GRUNTS

52:56.360 --> 52:58.800
GOLDEN MONKEY SCREECHES

52:58.800 --> 53:01.800
BEEPING

53:05.880 --> 53:07.480
WHISPERS:  Lyra...

53:33.640 --> 53:36.360
ALARM BLARES

53:36.360 --> 53:39.760
O Authority, saviour of
this Earth...

53:44.520 --> 53:47.640
..shine your perpetual
light upon us.

53:51.280 --> 53:53.000
Why isn't it working?

53:54.200 --> 53:56.120
Her key! The key!

54:11.280 --> 54:13.280
SHE PANTS

54:48.320 --> 54:51.920
METATRON: You think Dust can make
you gods.

54:53.880 --> 54:57.560
Let us see how you fare without it.

54:58.600 --> 55:02.200
HIGH-PITCHED RINGING

55:06.240 --> 55:07.760
RAPID BEEPING

55:18.560 --> 55:20.760
WHOOSHING

55:32.920 --> 55:35.200
INAUDIBLE

55:54.920 --> 55:57.120
LOUD RUMBLING
