01:56.854 --> 01:59.423

we get everything filed early,

pretty basic.

07:54.125 --> 07:56.432
- In some cases,
it's possible

07:56.476 --> 08:00.305

to lead to physical symptoms.

- No, you're not.

08:04.832 --> 08:08.052
Your symptoms are very real.

08:08.096 --> 08:12.448
You suffered
a devastating loss, a trauma.

08:15.103 --> 08:17.584
- Hugo's tests
were normal too.

08:20.587 --> 08:22.502
And then he died.

08:26.593 --> 08:28.332
- I don't think we're looking
at a psych condition.

08:28.377 --> 08:29.987
In conversion disorder,
it's rare

08:30.031 --> 08:32.467
that patients can express their
emotions the way Maria is.

08:32.511 --> 08:34.775
But her awareness
of the situation,

08:34.818 --> 08:37.778
her acknowledgment of the fear,
it doesn't fit.

08:37.821 --> 08:40.563
There's definitely
something physical going on.

08:40.607 --> 08:41.999
- I wish I knew what.

08:42.043 --> 08:43.827
Medical examiner said
Hugo died of brain swelling

08:43.871 --> 08:45.655
but don't know
what caused it.

08:45.699 --> 08:47.570
And here's the kicker:
it was only three days

08:47.614 --> 08:49.703
from when Hugo was admitted
to the time he died.

08:49.746 --> 08:53.358
- OK, so whatever it is,
it moved really fast.

08:55.317 --> 08:58.059
- [groans]
I think he's stuck.

08:58.102 --> 08:59.277
- No, just a big head.

08:59.321 --> 09:01.279
That's all.
- [groaning]

09:01.323 --> 09:02.542
- Oh, my God.

09:02.585 --> 09:04.239
Is he gonna fit?
- Yes, he will.

09:04.282 --> 09:05.675
We just need to open up
the birth canal a bit wider.

09:05.719 --> 09:07.068
- McRoberts?
- Yes.

09:07.111 --> 09:08.939
Call the OB resident on call.

09:08.983 --> 09:11.463
- Layla, we're gonna adjust you
to a new position, OK?

09:11.507 --> 09:13.030
It makes it easier
for the baby to come out.

09:13.074 --> 09:14.336
- OK.

09:14.379 --> 09:16.077
- I'm right here.
- All right, Quentin.

09:16.120 --> 09:17.905
Why don't you let him
take over for you, OK?

09:17.948 --> 09:19.080
And I can use some pressure.
- Yep.

09:19.123 --> 09:21.473
- I'm right here.

09:21.517 --> 09:23.214
- OK,
now on your next contraction,

09:23.258 --> 09:24.868
I want you to give me
everything you've got.

09:24.912 --> 09:26.130
Everything.
- OK.

09:26.174 --> 09:27.479
- OK.
- I can do this.

09:27.523 --> 09:29.307
- Yes, you can.
- You got this.

09:29.351 --> 09:31.875
You got this. You got this.
- OK.

09:31.919 --> 09:33.790
Oh.

09:33.834 --> 09:35.966
[yelling]

09:36.010 --> 09:38.012
- I've got the head.

09:38.055 --> 09:39.230
Shoulder.

09:39.274 --> 09:40.797
- [groans]
[baby crying]

09:40.841 --> 09:42.407
- I've got him.

09:42.451 --> 09:44.671
I got him.
He's here.

09:44.714 --> 09:46.498
He's here.

09:47.499 --> 09:49.719
He's here.
- Oh, my God.

09:49.763 --> 09:52.156
Oh, my God.

09:52.200 --> 09:54.071
I'm a mom.

09:54.115 --> 09:56.813
Our baby, he's beautiful.

09:56.857 --> 09:58.510
He's perfect.

09:58.554 --> 10:00.861
- Hey, Dad, do you want
to cut the umbilical cord?

10:00.904 --> 10:02.776
- [laughs nervously] Yeah.

10:02.819 --> 10:06.040
- OK. Just right here
in the middle, OK?

10:09.391 --> 10:11.175
- I want to hold him.

10:11.219 --> 10:13.569
- That's not my son.

10:14.962 --> 10:17.442
- What?

10:17.486 --> 10:19.836
- Layla, who's the father?

10:19.880 --> 10:21.751
- You are, Quentin.

10:21.795 --> 10:23.579
You are.
That's our baby.

10:23.623 --> 10:25.668
- No, you're lying!
You're lying!

10:25.712 --> 10:26.669
- Hey, Quentin, it's OK.

10:26.713 --> 10:28.236
We'll figure this out,
all right?

10:28.279 --> 10:29.933
- That's not my son.
- That's our baby.

10:29.977 --> 10:31.674
Of course it is!
- No, get back!

10:31.718 --> 10:34.546
- Of course it is!
Of course it is!

10:34.590 --> 10:36.070
- I got to get out of here.
- Hey, deep breaths, OK?

10:36.113 --> 10:37.245
Quentin, breathe with me.

10:37.288 --> 10:38.638
Breathe with me, Quentin.
Deep breaths.

10:38.681 --> 10:40.378
- I got to get out of here!
- Stay! Baby, stay!

10:40.422 --> 10:42.206
- Hey, call security.
- Help!

10:42.250 --> 10:43.860
Oh, my God.
What's happening?

10:43.904 --> 10:46.950
- Hey! Hey, stop!

10:46.994 --> 10:49.039
Hey, guards!
Quentin, stop!

10:49.083 --> 10:50.911
[alarm blaring]

10:50.954 --> 10:53.740
- Why are you chasing me?
Just leave me--leave me alone!

10:53.783 --> 10:56.656
- Hey, Quentin--
- Stay back! Stay back!

10:56.699 --> 10:58.179
- It's OK. It's OK.

10:58.222 --> 11:00.703
Deep breath.
Please, just breathe.

11:00.747 --> 11:02.705
- I just got
to get out of here.

11:02.749 --> 11:04.794
I just got to get out of here!
- No, no, no, no, no!

11:09.930 --> 11:11.975
All right, Quentin.

11:12.019 --> 11:13.934
It's OK.

11:13.977 --> 11:15.849
- [labored breathing]

11:15.892 --> 11:19.243
- Oh, my God, the scissors,
they're pulsating.

11:19.287 --> 11:20.680
- They're penetrating
the carotid artery.

11:20.723 --> 11:22.029
- I'll get someone
to turn off the machine.

11:22.072 --> 11:24.858
- No, the magnet
is holding everything in place,

11:24.901 --> 11:26.207
including the scissors.

11:26.250 --> 11:28.035
If gravity takes over,
it'll shift everything,

11:28.078 --> 11:31.299
and we'll have maybe 20 seconds
before he bleeds out.

11:31.342 --> 11:33.257
OK, we need help.
Call Dr. Archer.

11:33.301 --> 11:35.303
Dr. Charles too.
- Yeah.

11:37.044 --> 11:40.612
- Do not touch
the scissors, OK?

11:40.656 --> 11:42.919
We got you.

11:42.963 --> 11:44.790
Everything's gonna be OK.

11:49.404 --> 11:49.796
.

11:49.839 --> 11:52.015
- Coming through.
Excuse me.

11:52.059 --> 11:53.582
- Thank you guys for coming.

11:53.625 --> 11:55.627
- Absolutely.

11:55.671 --> 11:57.325
- Hey, fellas.
- Doctor.

11:59.719 --> 12:01.938
- He's conscious and calm
but out of it.

12:01.982 --> 12:03.853
He's not being crushed.
He's able to breathe.

12:03.897 --> 12:06.073
He's got to be in pain, though.
- OK.

12:06.116 --> 12:09.032
So let's give him
50 mics of fentanyl IM.

12:09.076 --> 12:10.947
Syringe is plastic
and the needle nonferrous,

12:10.991 --> 12:12.340
so it should be MRI safe.

12:12.383 --> 12:13.820
- OK, I'll get it.

12:13.863 --> 12:15.735
Dr. Asher went back
to be with his wife, Layla.

12:15.778 --> 12:17.780
She's still in L&D.
- OK.

12:17.824 --> 12:19.260
- It's a rescue situation.

12:19.303 --> 12:20.652
I just don't really know
where to start.

12:20.696 --> 12:22.306
All of our tools have metal.

12:22.350 --> 12:25.962
- So nothing is usable as long
as the MRI machine is running.

12:26.006 --> 12:28.791
All right, well, let's say
we did turn the machine off.

12:28.835 --> 12:30.097
- Everything falls
to the floor.

12:30.140 --> 12:32.099
Bed alone is
a couple hundred pounds.

12:32.142 --> 12:34.275
- I can put two of my guys
in there to try and catch it,

12:34.318 --> 12:36.103
then get it out of the way
so you can get to Quentin.

12:36.146 --> 12:38.322
- Scissors in his neck
are magnetic too.

12:38.366 --> 12:40.107
Cut the MRI's power,
they're gonna move.

12:40.150 --> 12:41.673
Quentin will bleed out fast.

12:41.717 --> 12:44.285
- If you could go in there
with clamps and stem the flow,

12:44.328 --> 12:46.766
would that buy us some time?
- Not enough.

12:46.809 --> 12:48.898
Odds of survival
are less than 1%.

12:48.942 --> 12:51.161
I'm running outcome
probabilities on our options,

12:51.205 --> 12:52.989
and turning off the machine
cold turkey is the worst.

12:53.033 --> 12:54.991
- So what's the best?

12:55.035 --> 12:57.385
- If CFD can secure Quentin

12:57.428 --> 12:59.300
and ensure
the bed won't displace him

12:59.343 --> 13:01.693
and Dr. Archer can
stabilize the neck wound

13:01.737 --> 13:03.217
all before turning off
the MRI machine,

13:03.260 --> 13:06.481
then the odds of survival
are roughly 61%.

13:06.524 --> 13:09.049
- OK, we've got a plan.
Can it be done?

13:09.092 --> 13:11.834
- Well, safest way
to secure the patient

13:11.878 --> 13:14.228
would be to do
a webbing harness.

13:14.271 --> 13:16.621
We can throw the ropes
over the MRI machine,

13:16.665 --> 13:18.885
and then two of my guys
can hold it on the other side.

13:18.928 --> 13:21.061
- OK, the magnet's off,
the bed falls.

13:21.104 --> 13:24.194
How do we ensure that
Quentin doesn't go with it?

13:24.238 --> 13:26.240
- We can create a buffer zone
between him and the bed

13:26.283 --> 13:29.025
using wooden cribbing,
wedges, and airbags.

13:29.069 --> 13:30.853
- We can run some hoses
and inflate them

13:30.897 --> 13:32.289
from a tank here
in the hallway.

13:32.333 --> 13:33.856
- All right,
we're halfway there.

13:33.900 --> 13:35.553
Dr. Archer?
- Yeah.

13:35.597 --> 13:37.164
I just need to clamp the artery

13:37.207 --> 13:38.252
in order
to control the bleeding.

13:38.295 --> 13:40.341
Then I could
take the scissors out.

13:40.384 --> 13:43.300
But the issue is
the tools needed to do it.

13:43.344 --> 13:45.346
- I can make them plastic.
3D printers.

13:45.389 --> 13:46.564
There are four
in the robotics lab.

13:46.608 --> 13:47.870
- All right.
Get on it.

13:47.914 --> 13:51.047
And get a few
of the 2.0 engineers to help.

13:51.091 --> 13:53.963
- We'll get started too.
- Good.

13:54.007 --> 13:55.399
- OK, you're doing great.

13:55.443 --> 13:57.010
Gonna give you
a little injection.

13:57.053 --> 13:58.402
Some pain meds, all right?

13:58.446 --> 14:01.579
To just make you
a little more comfortable, OK?

14:01.623 --> 14:03.494
Little pinch.

14:08.238 --> 14:09.544
OK.

14:11.241 --> 14:13.896
- Daniel?

14:13.940 --> 14:15.245
- I'm just gonna step away
for a second,

14:15.289 --> 14:16.551
have a little chat
with my colleague.

14:16.594 --> 14:18.466
I'm not going anywhere, OK?

14:21.512 --> 14:23.819
- How's he doing?

14:23.863 --> 14:28.171
- Well, you know, I mean, he's
pinned to an MRI machine, so...

14:28.215 --> 14:30.870
- Do you have any theories
on what sparked the break?

14:30.913 --> 14:33.307
- I've been really focusing
on trying to keep him calm.

14:33.350 --> 14:36.005
But how's the plan
to get him off the thing going?

14:36.049 --> 14:37.441
- Well, we've got one.

14:37.485 --> 14:39.617
But it's a possibility
that it won't work, Daniel,

14:39.661 --> 14:43.012
so I've asked Dr. Asher to
bring Quentin's wife down here

14:43.056 --> 14:45.928
to see him
'cause it may be the last time.

14:45.972 --> 14:47.887
- OK, thank you.

14:50.237 --> 14:52.326
- OK, making the incision.

14:54.197 --> 14:55.155
OK.

14:57.418 --> 14:59.986
OK, nice and easy.

15:02.249 --> 15:03.337
Lab cut.

15:08.168 --> 15:09.909
Yep.

15:09.952 --> 15:11.998
Definitely feeling
some adhesions.

15:12.041 --> 15:13.173
- Point taken.

15:13.216 --> 15:15.349
Open surgery
was the right call.

15:15.392 --> 15:17.438
Go ahead, say it.
"I told you so."

15:17.481 --> 15:19.048
- Yeah, maybe later.

15:19.092 --> 15:21.746
For now, why don't you get
some practice old-school style?

15:21.790 --> 15:23.618
Come around.

15:26.447 --> 15:28.057
OK. You got it?

15:28.101 --> 15:29.667
- Yeah.
- All right.

15:29.711 --> 15:31.060
- Babcock.

15:33.540 --> 15:35.804
[stomach gurgles]

15:35.847 --> 15:38.415
[grunts]

15:38.459 --> 15:40.156
- You OK?

15:40.200 --> 15:41.897
- Yeah, it's just
a little heartburn.

15:41.941 --> 15:43.290
I'm fine.

15:44.726 --> 15:46.946
Oh, uh--
[farts]

15:48.817 --> 15:51.124
Uh, God, excuse me.
I'm sorry.

15:51.167 --> 15:53.387
- [laughs]
- Stop it.

15:53.430 --> 15:54.954
Stop.

15:54.997 --> 15:56.303
It's no big deal.

15:56.346 --> 16:00.046
It happens, OK?
Just focus on the field.

16:01.569 --> 16:04.006
Stay focused.

16:04.050 --> 16:05.486
[stomach gurgles]

16:05.529 --> 16:07.749
- Uh-oh,
here comes another one.

16:07.792 --> 16:09.142
- [groans]
- Kai?

16:09.185 --> 16:11.492
- [groaning]
- Kai, talk to me.

16:11.535 --> 16:13.015
Hey, buddy! Hey!

16:13.059 --> 16:15.670
Angel. Angel, check him.

16:17.411 --> 16:18.890
- Got a pulse.
- All right.

16:18.934 --> 16:20.892
Give me the babcock, please.

16:20.936 --> 16:22.416
- Maria!
- Need some help in here!

16:22.459 --> 16:24.070
- Maria!

16:24.113 --> 16:25.506
- I was helping her
to the bathroom,

16:25.549 --> 16:26.420
and she started seizing.

16:26.463 --> 16:28.030
- OK, 4 milligrams of Ativan.

16:28.074 --> 16:29.597
- [speaking Spanish]

16:29.640 --> 16:31.120
Please help her. Please.

16:31.164 --> 16:34.428
- [speaking Spanish]

16:34.471 --> 16:36.212
- Ativan's in.

16:41.043 --> 16:42.610
- OK, she's gonna be
postictal for a while.

16:42.653 --> 16:43.785
Put her on a foley.

16:43.828 --> 16:44.829
I don't want her
getting out of the bed,

16:44.873 --> 16:46.440
not even for the bathroom.

16:54.100 --> 16:56.015
- A seizure expands
our differential tenfold.

16:56.058 --> 16:57.842
We got to widen our net--
CT panscan,

16:57.886 --> 17:00.062
MRI brain, sed rate,
autoimmune labs.

17:00.106 --> 17:01.237
Let's rope in neurology.
- Guys.

17:01.281 --> 17:02.412
Ms. Goodwin just called.

17:02.456 --> 17:03.935
She said stand down.
No more treatment.

17:03.979 --> 17:05.067
- What?
What are you talking about?

17:05.111 --> 17:06.068
- She's in the MRI suite.

17:06.112 --> 17:08.114
Be here as soon as she can, OK?

17:11.682 --> 17:13.641
- Hey, you OK?
- This is overkill.

17:13.684 --> 17:15.425
I probably
just had some bad oatmeal.

17:15.469 --> 17:17.558
- Well, bad oatmeal
doesn't drop you

17:17.601 --> 17:18.950
in the middle of surgery.

17:18.993 --> 17:21.736
So how about
you let me check you out?

17:24.173 --> 17:26.262
- How's Sam?
Appendectomy go OK?

17:26.306 --> 17:28.656
- Yeah, all good.
Dr. Graham is finishing up.

17:28.699 --> 17:30.136
- At least
it's just an appendectomy.

17:30.179 --> 17:32.007
Not missing much.

17:32.051 --> 17:33.269
[groaning]

17:33.313 --> 17:34.966
[machinery beeping rapidly]

17:35.010 --> 17:36.881
Oh, my chest. Pressure.

17:36.925 --> 17:39.841
[farts]

17:39.884 --> 17:41.495
Oh, God.
I'm sorry.

17:43.149 --> 17:44.802
- That was weird.

17:44.846 --> 17:46.804
Your heart rate plummeted,
but as soon as you passed gas,

17:46.848 --> 17:48.023
it came back.

17:48.067 --> 17:50.025
Will you sit up for me?

17:52.854 --> 17:54.290
Take a deep breath.

17:54.334 --> 17:56.510
- [breathes deeply]

17:56.553 --> 17:58.164
- All right.
Lean back for me.

17:58.207 --> 18:00.949
Hey, Mike.
Let's get an X-ray in here.

18:00.992 --> 18:02.298
- What, did you hear a murmur?

18:02.342 --> 18:04.039
- Honestly,
I'm not sure what I heard.

18:04.083 --> 18:05.475
- You're joking, right?
Come on.

18:05.519 --> 18:08.087
- Has heartburn
been an issue before today?

18:08.130 --> 18:09.610
- I mean, I get it.

18:09.653 --> 18:11.873
Even when I was a kid, it
would flare up here and there.

18:11.916 --> 18:14.267
But it's never been an issue.

18:14.310 --> 18:16.704
- X-ray up. Clear.

18:16.747 --> 18:18.227
[machine whirring]

18:22.840 --> 18:25.321
- What the hell?
That's my colon.

18:25.365 --> 18:26.801
It shouldn't be in my chest.

18:26.844 --> 18:29.108
- No, it should not.

18:31.327 --> 18:33.590
- Her brother. Hugo, was
a patient treated at Oakview.

18:33.634 --> 18:34.809
- So was Maria.

18:34.852 --> 18:37.203
She was admitted yesterday
via ambulance,

18:37.246 --> 18:40.293
but this morning,
her family just walked her out.

18:40.336 --> 18:41.729
They just left--absconded.

18:41.772 --> 18:43.339
- Well,
her brother died at Oakview,

18:43.383 --> 18:44.819
and they didn't
get any answers.

18:44.862 --> 18:46.168
You see how scared they are.

18:46.212 --> 18:47.300
It's no wonder
that they didn't want to stay.

18:47.343 --> 18:49.215
- Look, I agree,
but walking out

18:49.258 --> 18:51.608
is the same as leaving
against medical advice.

18:51.652 --> 18:54.002
It's triggered
an insurance nightmare

18:54.045 --> 18:55.612
with the family's HMO.

18:55.656 --> 18:57.832
They won't pay
for any more treatment

18:57.875 --> 18:59.921
until Maria is placed back

18:59.964 --> 19:03.403
with their preferred network
provider, Oakview.

19:03.446 --> 19:05.883
- Are you kidding me?
They're a community hospital.

19:05.927 --> 19:08.190
They don't have the resources
to run the tests she needs.

19:08.234 --> 19:09.583
- Well,
I've already reached out

19:09.626 --> 19:12.020
to the director
of patient services at Oakview,

19:12.063 --> 19:14.370
and she assured me
they'll do the best they can.

19:14.414 --> 19:16.024
- The best they can?

19:16.067 --> 19:19.027
- Ms. Goodwin, can't you reason
with the insurance company?

19:19.070 --> 19:21.334
Hector and Gloria aren't trying
to take advantage of them.

19:21.377 --> 19:23.031
They're trying
to save their daughter's life.

19:23.074 --> 19:24.554
- Look, I know,
and I share

19:24.598 --> 19:26.513
in your frustration,
but they're--

19:26.556 --> 19:28.863
- No. No, I don't care what
the insurance company says.

19:28.906 --> 19:31.213
I'm not sending Maria back to
Oakview until I get a guarantee

19:31.257 --> 19:32.867
she gets the treatment
she needs in time.

19:32.910 --> 19:35.391
- Dr. Halstead,
the tests that you ordered

19:35.435 --> 19:37.306
will cost
tens of thousands of dollars,

19:37.350 --> 19:39.656
and I know that's not
coming out your pocket.

19:39.700 --> 19:43.269
The family has to decide
how to proceed.

19:52.974 --> 19:53.192
.

19:53.235 --> 19:54.976
- OK, Quentin,
so listen,

19:55.019 --> 19:57.152
we're gonna secure you
to the machine

19:57.196 --> 19:59.285
while it's still running
with a harness.

19:59.328 --> 20:01.330
So then, Dr. Archer,
who is an excellent surgeon,

20:01.374 --> 20:02.940
is gonna come in here
and clamp your artery,

20:02.984 --> 20:04.594
stabilize your neck wound,

20:04.638 --> 20:06.857
and make it safer when
they pull out the scissors.

20:06.901 --> 20:09.120
All right?
Then we turn off the machine.

20:09.164 --> 20:11.384
The idea is,
bed falls to the side,

20:11.427 --> 20:14.691
you're held firmly in place
by the harness, OK?

20:14.735 --> 20:16.563
Still with me?
- Mm-hmm.

20:16.606 --> 20:18.173
- Great.
Last thing.

20:18.217 --> 20:20.784
Lower you onto a gurney,
shoot you off the ER,

20:20.828 --> 20:23.004
and finish fixing up your neck.

20:23.047 --> 20:25.006
How's that sound?
- Mm-hmm.

20:34.624 --> 20:36.887
[grunts]
Am I gonna die?

20:36.931 --> 20:38.628
- Look, this is
a complicated situation.

20:38.672 --> 20:42.153
But some really skilled people
have come up with this plan,

20:42.197 --> 20:44.025
and it's
the best option we got.

20:44.068 --> 20:47.028
All you got to do:
breathe in and out,

20:47.071 --> 20:51.162
stay as still
as you possibly can, OK?

20:51.206 --> 20:52.729
All right.

20:52.773 --> 20:54.992
Take all the time you need.

20:57.256 --> 20:59.736
- Hey, hold the work.
Everybody, out.

21:07.657 --> 21:10.443
- You're my everything.

21:10.486 --> 21:14.534
From our first date,
I knew that I was in love.

21:14.577 --> 21:17.667
And now we're parents.

21:17.711 --> 21:19.190
Uh...

21:21.192 --> 21:23.282
The nurse
took a picture of him.

21:26.110 --> 21:28.983
I named him Trevor,
after your dad.

21:29.026 --> 21:31.115
I think he'd like that.

21:32.813 --> 21:35.729
- Tell Trevor I love him.

21:35.772 --> 21:38.688
- You're gonna
tell him yourself.

21:38.732 --> 21:41.430
- You're gonna be
a great mother.

21:42.953 --> 21:44.999
- I love you, Quentin.

21:45.042 --> 21:47.958
I will see you again,
you hear me?

21:48.002 --> 21:50.396
I will see you again.

21:56.837 --> 21:59.970
[sobbing]

22:04.758 --> 22:06.629
Sorry.

22:06.673 --> 22:09.763
I didn't know what to say.

22:09.806 --> 22:12.418
How do you
put into words when--

22:12.461 --> 22:14.463
- You can't.

22:14.507 --> 22:16.770
But we could feel
your love for each other.

22:16.813 --> 22:18.641
- I just don't understand,

22:18.685 --> 22:21.601
because Quentin is my rock,

22:21.644 --> 22:26.693
and I don't even recognize
the man that's in there.

22:26.736 --> 22:28.999
He just snapped.

22:29.043 --> 22:31.045
How does that happen
all of a sudden?

22:31.088 --> 22:34.178
- I mean, usually
there are signs, you know?

22:34.222 --> 22:37.573
Extreme expressions
of emotional frustration,

22:37.617 --> 22:39.619
anger, confusion, outbursts.

22:39.662 --> 22:43.057
You noticed anything like that
in Quentin recently?

22:43.100 --> 22:46.147
- I don't think so.
- How about physical changes?

22:46.190 --> 22:48.410
I noticed he had some lumps
on the back of his neck.

22:48.454 --> 22:49.977
Have you--
do you know what those are?

22:50.020 --> 22:53.763
- Lumps? I don't know.

22:53.807 --> 22:58.464
I just wanted to get to today
and to have the baby.

22:58.507 --> 23:00.553
I've been so consumed
by the pregnancy

23:00.596 --> 23:04.295
that I haven't noticed
anything else.

23:04.339 --> 23:06.080
Oh, Quentin.

23:11.868 --> 23:13.653
- Uh, give it to Spellman.

23:13.696 --> 23:14.784
Thanks, Lori.

23:14.828 --> 23:16.482
Mystery solved.
Your chest CT.

23:16.525 --> 23:19.354
- Hiatal hernia.
- No, diaphragmatic.

23:19.398 --> 23:22.009
Big enough that your colon
migrated into your chest.

23:22.052 --> 23:24.490
So the gas moving through it,

23:24.533 --> 23:27.231
it puts pressure on the vagus
nerve, drops your heartbeat.

23:27.275 --> 23:28.929
- Breaking wind
releases the pressure.

23:28.972 --> 23:30.496
Heart returns to a normal rate.
- Yeah.

23:30.539 --> 23:32.106
You said you had heartburn
since you were a kid.

23:32.149 --> 23:34.064
Probably this: undiagnosed

23:34.108 --> 23:37.111
asymptomatic congenital
diaphragmatic hernia.

23:37.154 --> 23:38.721
- I've never passed out before,
though.

23:38.765 --> 23:41.550
- Well, my guess is it's been
slowly expanding over time.

23:41.594 --> 23:43.030
But you do CrossFit now,

23:43.073 --> 23:45.380
so the thrusters,
burpees, other workouts--

23:45.424 --> 23:48.035
safe bet that they've
exacerbated the condition.

23:48.078 --> 23:50.385
Led to today.
- Yeah, well, I'll own that.

23:50.429 --> 23:52.039
But I can't resist
dropping in the OR again,

23:52.082 --> 23:54.215
so let's fix this hernia.
- OK.

23:54.258 --> 23:57.523
Well, you've got
a few surgical options.

23:57.566 --> 23:58.915
Open.
- No.

23:58.959 --> 24:00.526
That's a huge incision.
Lots of digging around.

24:00.569 --> 24:02.528
I'll be laid up
in the ICU for weeks.

24:02.571 --> 24:03.877
- Laparoscopic, then.

24:03.920 --> 24:05.661
Be more incisions
for the scope and tools,

24:05.705 --> 24:08.055
but less invasive--
- No old-school approaches.

24:08.098 --> 24:09.709
Robotic assist in OR 2.0.

24:09.752 --> 24:11.580
Shortest recovery time.

24:13.321 --> 24:15.584
I just want this
to be over with.

24:15.628 --> 24:18.282
- OK, I'm gonna scrub in.

24:18.326 --> 24:19.588
I'll see you after, OK?

24:24.941 --> 24:27.204
- Holy cow.
Look at this place.

24:27.248 --> 24:29.206
It's like you guys are living
in 2050 up here.

24:29.250 --> 24:31.818
- So don't break anything.

24:31.861 --> 24:33.515
- How's it going
with the surgical tools?

24:33.559 --> 24:35.561
- Almost there.
Scalpel's printed.

24:35.604 --> 24:37.171
Two of the three angled
peripheral vascular clamps

24:37.214 --> 24:38.259
are printed as well.

24:38.302 --> 24:39.521
One Weitlaner retractor
printed.

24:39.565 --> 24:41.523
One to go.
- Oh, it's like the real thing.

24:41.567 --> 24:43.917
- It is the real thing,
just plastic.

24:43.960 --> 24:45.658
These tools,
I think they can work.

24:45.701 --> 24:47.094
- They'll have to.

24:47.137 --> 24:48.574
They're all we got.

24:51.185 --> 24:54.101
- [speaking Spanish]

24:54.144 --> 24:56.538
- They never wanted
to go to Oakview,

24:56.582 --> 24:58.497
but the ambulance
took them there anyway.

24:58.540 --> 25:00.542
- Because Maria
didn't require specialty care,

25:00.586 --> 25:03.110
paramedics took her to
the nearest hospital instead.

25:03.153 --> 25:06.243
- [speaking Spanish]

25:07.854 --> 25:12.467
- [speaking Spanish]

25:12.511 --> 25:15.949
- I'm so sorry that you've
been put in this situation.

25:15.992 --> 25:18.212
We can continue to treat Maria,

25:18.255 --> 25:21.215
but your insurance
won't cover the costs.

25:21.258 --> 25:24.348
- [speaking Spanish]

25:26.437 --> 25:29.528
[both speaking Spanish]

25:31.660 --> 25:35.359
- He said he'll sell the car.
He can get a second job.

25:35.403 --> 25:37.100
His oldest son
can get a job as well.

25:37.144 --> 25:38.798
- No. Papa, no.

25:38.841 --> 25:40.451
No.

25:40.495 --> 25:42.323
[speaking Spanish]
I'll go back.

25:42.366 --> 25:44.586
- No.
[speaking Spanish]

25:44.630 --> 25:46.806
- Maria--
- [speaking Spanish]

25:46.849 --> 25:49.156
- Maria.

25:49.199 --> 25:52.551
[speaking Spanish]

25:52.594 --> 25:54.944
- [sighs]

25:54.988 --> 25:58.557
[speaking Spanish]

26:14.224 --> 26:18.054
You know, maybe Oakview
will figure it out.

26:23.582 --> 26:24.539
- All right.

26:24.583 --> 26:28.456
Um, I'll set up the transfer.

26:35.115 --> 26:36.595
- What was Maria saying?

26:36.638 --> 26:38.858
- If she lets her parents
bankrupt the family

26:38.901 --> 26:41.643
paying for her medical care,
then all of the opportunities

26:41.687 --> 26:45.212
they've worked so hard to give
their children will be lost.

26:45.255 --> 26:47.040
- She is risking her life.

26:47.083 --> 26:48.824
- No.

26:48.868 --> 26:51.044
No, she's sacrificing it.

26:51.087 --> 26:54.874
And it's awful,

26:54.917 --> 26:57.528
but I get it.

27:06.146 --> 27:06.320
.

27:06.363 --> 27:07.538
Ready to inflate?

27:10.498 --> 27:11.847
Up on blue.

27:11.891 --> 27:13.544
[tank hissing]

27:13.588 --> 27:14.850
Hold.

27:16.417 --> 27:17.984
Up on red.

27:18.027 --> 27:19.376
[tank hissing]

27:23.729 --> 27:24.991
Hold.

27:29.299 --> 27:31.954
- How's, uh--
how's Layla doing?

27:31.998 --> 27:35.044
- She's in shock,
full of grief,

27:35.088 --> 27:36.611
and a first-time mom
all at the same time.

27:36.655 --> 27:39.701
It's a lot, but
a psych resident is with her.

27:39.745 --> 27:43.009
- Mm.
And how about you?

27:43.052 --> 27:45.489
How are you doing?

27:45.533 --> 27:48.405
- Honestly,
I didn't see this coming.

27:48.449 --> 27:52.105
I just thought Quentin
was a nervous first-time dad,

27:52.148 --> 27:54.673
like the ones
I see every single day.

27:54.716 --> 27:56.413
Never suspected mental illness.

27:56.457 --> 27:58.372
- You know,
I'm not sure it is, per se.

27:58.415 --> 28:01.375
You know those lumps
on the back of his neck?

28:01.418 --> 28:03.029
I have a very strong hunch
that they're indicative

28:03.072 --> 28:04.770
of a physical issue
that could very well

28:04.813 --> 28:07.729
be causing a sudden psychosis.

28:07.773 --> 28:09.296
- It's physical,
not psychological?

28:09.339 --> 28:11.037
- Yeah, I'm leaning that way.

28:11.080 --> 28:13.822
I mean, can't be sure
until we run some tests.

28:18.174 --> 28:21.874
- [labored breathing]

28:25.442 --> 28:27.140
- Maria,
this is a thumb drive

28:27.183 --> 28:29.316
with all the work we did here,
along with our notes.

28:29.359 --> 28:32.711
You give this to the doctors
as soon as you get there.

28:32.754 --> 28:34.016
- Thank you.

28:37.846 --> 28:40.022
- All right.
Empty her foley.

28:47.769 --> 28:49.075
- It's OK, Mama.

28:51.686 --> 28:53.862
- [sniffs] Wait.

28:55.821 --> 28:57.126
Will?

29:00.956 --> 29:02.392
You smell that?

29:07.658 --> 29:09.356
[speaking Spanish]

29:09.399 --> 29:10.661
- We have to run one more test.

29:10.705 --> 29:12.881
I'll pay for it myself,
if I have to.

29:15.014 --> 29:18.408
[both speaking Spanish]

29:18.452 --> 29:19.888
- I'm scared.

29:19.932 --> 29:22.456
- Well, you'll be less
frightened if you can't see it,

29:22.499 --> 29:25.415
so I'm gonna
drape your face, OK?

29:27.504 --> 29:28.810
[grunts] Yeah.

29:28.854 --> 29:30.812
- All right.

29:30.856 --> 29:32.379
- Here we go. Careful.

29:34.033 --> 29:35.904
That's right.
All right.

29:37.036 --> 29:38.864
All right.

29:38.907 --> 29:41.823
10cc's of lidocaine, please.

29:41.867 --> 29:43.869
OK.

29:43.912 --> 29:46.306
All right.

29:55.402 --> 29:56.620
OK.

29:56.664 --> 29:59.580
Scalpel.

29:59.623 --> 30:01.234
All right.
Grab hold of those scissors.

30:01.277 --> 30:04.106
I don't want them flopping
after I make the incisions.

30:07.588 --> 30:09.372
Here we go.

30:09.416 --> 30:10.721
[grunts]

30:14.290 --> 30:16.640
OK.

30:16.684 --> 30:17.772
All right.

30:17.816 --> 30:19.295
Wheaties.

30:22.864 --> 30:24.300
All right.

30:24.344 --> 30:26.868
All right.
Watch your fingers there.

30:26.912 --> 30:29.523
That's it. That's it.
Don't move it. Don't move it.

30:29.566 --> 30:31.046
Clamp.

30:35.703 --> 30:36.704
All right.

30:45.974 --> 30:48.063
All right.

30:48.107 --> 30:50.283
Carotid clamps in place.
CFD, you're up.

30:50.326 --> 30:51.850
- All right.
Spread out around the bed.

30:51.893 --> 30:54.113
When it falls down, we pull it
away from the MRI machine.

30:54.156 --> 30:57.377
- All right. And no slack
at all, you understand?

30:57.420 --> 30:59.640
If there's any movement,
his clamps could pop off,

30:59.683 --> 31:02.382
and then we'll have a problem
we might not be able to fix.

31:02.425 --> 31:03.731
All right.

31:03.774 --> 31:06.777
On three, you're gonna
cut the power to the MRI.

31:06.821 --> 31:07.996

Everybody, ready?

31:08.040 --> 31:09.084

31:09.128 --> 31:12.435

31:12.479 --> 31:14.220

31:18.354 --> 31:20.095

31:23.794 --> 31:25.057

31:25.100 --> 31:26.928

OK, bed.

31:26.972 --> 31:29.670

31:32.368 --> 31:35.023

Freaking incredible.

- Thanks. Can someone get me
a bottle of water, please?

31:53.259 --> 31:55.435
- Dr. Archer, you did it.

31:55.478 --> 31:57.524
- Dean, you all right?
- Yeah.

31:57.567 --> 31:59.830
I got to get to the OR, so...

31:59.874 --> 32:01.441
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

32:01.484 --> 32:04.096
- Page Dr. Lanik
to take over with Quentin.

32:04.139 --> 32:05.010
- I'm just feeling
a little dizzy.

32:05.053 --> 32:06.272
That's all.

32:13.670 --> 32:13.888

32:13.932 --> 32:15.324

32:15.368 --> 32:17.239
- I'd say
you're as good as new.

32:17.283 --> 32:19.198
- Yeah, not quite.

32:19.241 --> 32:20.764
I'm the fart doctor now.

32:20.808 --> 32:22.723
A punchline.
- No.

32:22.766 --> 32:24.681
What happened today
was a result

32:24.725 --> 32:25.856
of a medical ailment, OK?

32:25.900 --> 32:27.119
- Like anyone's
gonna care about that.

32:27.162 --> 32:28.816
All they're gonna
remember is the fart.

32:28.859 --> 32:30.992
- Oh, come on.
It'll blow over.

32:32.602 --> 32:34.953
Sorry. Poor choice of words,
but it will.

32:34.996 --> 32:37.477
- [laughs]
I doubt it.

32:37.520 --> 32:38.782
- All right, look.

32:38.826 --> 32:41.176
I'll check on you
a little later, OK?

32:41.220 --> 32:42.134
All right.

32:43.962 --> 32:47.095
- So his neck is fixed, then?
- Yeah.

32:47.139 --> 32:49.184
The artery repair
went very well.

32:49.228 --> 32:51.795
- What about his mind?
Because before--

32:51.839 --> 32:53.797
- Well, I gave him
a very small dose

32:53.841 --> 32:55.886
of an antipsychotic
called risperidone,

32:55.930 --> 32:58.019
and he does seem
to be thinking more clearly.

32:58.063 --> 33:01.196
- And you think
he'll stay that way?

33:01.240 --> 33:02.632
- I don't think
that what happened today

33:02.676 --> 33:04.460
is the result
of mental illness.

33:04.504 --> 33:05.766
You know,
tests are still pending,

33:05.809 --> 33:07.986
but all indications are
is that Quentin has

33:08.029 --> 33:11.424
a genetic disease called
neurofibromatosis type 2.

33:11.467 --> 33:13.600
- Is it curable?
- It's not.

33:13.643 --> 33:15.950
But there are a lot of
effective treatments out there.

33:15.994 --> 33:18.431
And the good news is
that with a little luck,

33:18.474 --> 33:21.216
Quentin is gonna be
the man you know again.

33:21.260 --> 33:23.566
- Genetic means
he's had it forever.

33:23.610 --> 33:25.612
Why'd it suddenly
go berserk today?

33:25.655 --> 33:28.832
- NF is thought to be
an inflammatory ailment, right?

33:28.876 --> 33:31.835
So possibly triggered
by changes in environment,

33:31.879 --> 33:33.446
you know,
lifestyle,

33:33.489 --> 33:37.580
possibly diet, medication.

33:37.624 --> 33:40.670
- Diet.

33:40.714 --> 33:42.368
Oh, my God.

33:42.411 --> 33:45.936
The minute I got pregnant,
my hormones went crazy.

33:45.980 --> 33:47.634
Smells were intense,

33:47.677 --> 33:50.637
and Quentin's breath
was the worst.

33:50.680 --> 33:53.466
Everything he ate
made me throw up.

33:53.509 --> 33:55.685
So he gave up his entire diet.

33:55.729 --> 33:58.253
No more fruits,
vegetables, fish.

33:58.297 --> 34:00.081
For the past nine months,
he's been eating nothing

34:00.125 --> 34:02.823
but bland,
processed crap for me.

34:02.866 --> 34:06.740
- Mrs. Bell,
Quentin's asking to see you.

34:08.481 --> 34:10.135
- [grunts]

34:17.359 --> 34:19.187
Hi, honey.

34:19.231 --> 34:22.016
- Layla...

34:22.060 --> 34:23.931
I don't entirely understand

34:23.974 --> 34:27.674
what happened or why,

34:27.717 --> 34:29.545
but I know I put you in danger.

34:29.589 --> 34:30.851
I'm sorry.

34:30.893 --> 34:33.158
- No, Quentin.

34:33.201 --> 34:35.856
I was so tied up
in the pregnancy,

34:35.899 --> 34:38.424
I was oblivious
to what was going on with you.

34:38.467 --> 34:41.992
I should've seen the signs.
Forgive me.

34:42.036 --> 34:45.474
- Oh, honey,
there's nothing to forgive.

34:45.518 --> 34:46.909
- I love you.

34:46.954 --> 34:49.652
- I love you too.

34:49.696 --> 34:53.091
- Someone's been
missing you guys.

34:57.834 --> 35:00.881
- Hi.

35:00.924 --> 35:03.101
- Here you go.

35:04.885 --> 35:08.323
- Hi, sweetheart.
Look who's here.

35:08.367 --> 35:09.672
- Hi.

35:09.716 --> 35:11.892
I'm your dad.

35:13.198 --> 35:16.026
I love you.

35:16.070 --> 35:19.900
- Shh, sweetheart.
- Hi.

35:19.943 --> 35:22.772
- A metabolic condition?
- Yeah.

35:22.816 --> 35:24.948
It's called
maple syrup urine disease,

35:24.992 --> 35:27.081
and it's a rare condition
that makes it difficult

35:27.125 --> 35:29.388
for the body to break down
certain amino acids.

35:29.431 --> 35:32.739
- The trademark symptom is
a distinct maple syrup smell

35:32.782 --> 35:34.175
that shows up in urine.

35:34.219 --> 35:36.003
- It usually presents
in childhood,

35:36.046 --> 35:37.700
and it's almost unheard of

35:37.744 --> 35:40.442
to discover it
in someone your age,

35:40.486 --> 35:42.009
or Hugo's.

35:42.052 --> 35:44.446
It's likely that he had it too.

35:44.490 --> 35:45.665
- And I suspect this is why

35:45.708 --> 35:48.058
Oakview couldn't
diagnose him in time.

35:48.102 --> 35:50.060
He didn't have a seizure
or a foley catheter.

35:50.104 --> 35:52.062
It made his doctors' jobs
even harder.

35:52.106 --> 35:55.631
- Wait,
this disease killed Hugo.

35:55.675 --> 35:56.937
Does that mean--

35:56.980 --> 35:59.331
- No, you're gonna be OK.

35:59.374 --> 36:01.724
You have an intermittent form
of the disease,

36:01.768 --> 36:04.510
which can be managed by closely
monitoring protein levels.

36:04.553 --> 36:06.207
- We've already reached out
to nephrology

36:06.251 --> 36:08.209
to discuss treatment options.

36:08.253 --> 36:12.082
- Maria.

36:33.495 --> 36:35.323
- Hello, Daniel.
- Ooh!

36:36.803 --> 36:39.327
Hey, you're, uh--
you're a little early.

36:39.371 --> 36:42.112
- Oh, I couldn't wait
to see you.

36:42.156 --> 36:45.072
What's this?
You cleaned your office?

36:45.115 --> 36:46.291
- No, I didn't.

36:47.727 --> 36:49.729
I'm tidying up a little bit.

36:49.772 --> 36:51.905
- Why?

36:53.602 --> 36:56.562
- I was very embarrassed
by what happened this morning.

36:56.605 --> 37:01.001
And um, you know, I just, uh--

37:01.044 --> 37:05.048
I don't ever want you
to feel that I--

37:05.092 --> 37:08.269
I take for granted
the job that you do, or--

37:08.313 --> 37:09.966
or that I'm oblivious
to how hard you work.

37:10.010 --> 37:12.099
I really don't want that
to happen.

37:12.142 --> 37:14.188
- You're very sweet.

37:15.755 --> 37:18.497
I care about you too, Daniel.

37:18.540 --> 37:19.498
A lot.

37:20.803 --> 37:22.327
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

37:22.370 --> 37:23.458
- Huh.

37:33.599 --> 37:35.644
- Hey.
- Hey.

37:35.688 --> 37:37.037
Ah!

37:37.080 --> 37:38.952
Where'd you find it?
- Nurses' station.

37:38.995 --> 37:40.475
- Oh, makes sense.

37:40.519 --> 37:42.825
That's where I was when
the call about Quentin came in.

37:42.869 --> 37:44.349
- Yeah, I totally get it.

37:44.392 --> 37:47.177
I would have run off
and left it behind too.

37:47.221 --> 37:51.181
But my kidneys can handle
some mild dehydration.

37:51.225 --> 37:52.835
Yours can't.
- Yeah, yeah.

37:52.879 --> 37:56.143
- Yeah, pretty sure there will
be another emergency tomorrow,

37:56.186 --> 37:58.058
and the day after that,

37:58.101 --> 38:01.931
so I'm gonna
give you something.

38:01.975 --> 38:04.412
It is a tracking device.
- Ah.

38:04.456 --> 38:06.066
- App connects it
to your phone.

38:06.109 --> 38:08.938
And I haven't lost my keys
since I put it on, so...

38:08.982 --> 38:12.507
- Well, keep it.
I'm past water bottles.

38:12.551 --> 38:14.204
Nephrologist just left.

38:14.248 --> 38:17.556
Uh, my kidneys
are getting worse.

38:22.865 --> 38:24.258
- Dialysis?

38:33.789 --> 38:36.923
- That was a big win today.

38:36.966 --> 38:39.708
You saved that family.

38:39.752 --> 38:42.494
- Yeah.

38:42.537 --> 38:45.845
I suppose it's time
to talk about my DACA renewal.

38:45.888 --> 38:47.716
I know
I've been dragging my feet.

38:47.760 --> 38:50.893
- It's been a long day.
We can speak in the morning.

38:50.937 --> 38:53.026
- No. No, I'm ready.

38:53.069 --> 38:55.420
- Yeah? All right.

38:58.771 --> 39:01.948
- Truth is, I've been
thinking about leaving Med.

39:01.991 --> 39:03.819
- Really?

39:03.863 --> 39:07.257
- I've always been in school
or protected by my residency,

39:07.301 --> 39:11.218
so my immigration status
has always been stable.

39:11.261 --> 39:14.700
But my parents, despite
them always having jobs,

39:14.743 --> 39:16.136
could never solidify theirs,

39:16.179 --> 39:18.356
so they moved to Canada.

39:18.399 --> 39:19.835
- Hmm.

39:19.879 --> 39:23.491
- But they can't enter
the country to come visit me.

39:23.535 --> 39:27.626
And if I leave to go see them,
I might be denied reentry.

39:27.669 --> 39:31.064
So...

39:31.107 --> 39:34.067
I haven't hugged my parents
in a decade.

39:34.110 --> 39:36.025
- Ugh.

39:36.069 --> 39:39.115
That's--that's heartbreaking.

39:39.159 --> 39:42.858
- But Maria today,
her bravery,

39:42.902 --> 39:47.602
what she was willing
to sacrifice for her family,

39:47.646 --> 39:50.823
reminded me that

39:50.866 --> 39:53.521
"no one puts their child
in a boat

39:53.565 --> 39:56.219
unless the water is safer
than the land."

39:56.263 --> 39:58.961
- Warsan Shire.

39:59.005 --> 40:01.660
Oh, that's a beautiful poem.

40:03.009 --> 40:04.663
- So...

40:04.706 --> 40:09.145
my parents' sacrifice
to get me here

40:09.189 --> 40:12.801
put me in this boat,

40:12.845 --> 40:15.325
which is why I have to stay.

40:16.631 --> 40:18.503
- And Dr. Cuevas,

40:18.546 --> 40:22.855
I believe
that you will find a way

40:22.898 --> 40:25.814
to see your parents again.

40:25.858 --> 40:28.295
But until that day,

40:28.338 --> 40:32.952
know that you have family here
in us at Med.

40:32.995 --> 40:35.345
- Thank you.
