WEBVTT

00:05.298 --> 00:07.759
OK, OK, OK.
Let's do sophomore year of high school.

00:07.842 --> 00:09.010
Uh, Nathan Burlingame.

00:09.094 --> 00:10.762
- Didn't like you.
- Huh.

00:11.137 --> 00:12.263
Kylie Mansard?

00:12.305 --> 00:13.932
Thought you were cool but intimidating.

00:14.015 --> 00:16.893
No way! I thought <i>she</i> was intimidating!

00:16.976 --> 00:18.853
That's why I shoved her into that creek.

00:19.312 --> 00:24.234
Well, after my chilli episode, I asked
the administration for a one-year sabbatical

00:24.275 --> 00:25.193
and good news.

00:25.318 --> 00:26.694
They fired me!

00:26.820 --> 00:30.406
So, I am free and easy.

00:30.448 --> 00:33.910
Well, the rest of the Soul Squad
is off helping Jason's dad.

00:33.993 --> 00:34.953
Who are we saving?

00:35.036 --> 00:37.997
No one from my high school,
I will tell you that much.

00:38.081 --> 00:42.335
Well, before we do anything,
I have to break things off with Simone.

00:42.460 --> 00:45.797
If I slip up and tell her about the universe,
it could doom her for eternity.

00:46.131 --> 00:49.384
And I've avoided talking to her for so long,
she assumed I had laryngitis

00:49.425 --> 00:51.678
and it went too far,
and now I'm on antibiotics!

00:51.719 --> 00:55.140
OK, settle down.
Your moral code means you can't lie, right?

00:56.099 --> 00:57.308
You need to just ghost her.

00:57.392 --> 00:59.227
Disappear, block her number.

00:59.352 --> 01:02.856
Bonus, anything she left in your apartment
now legally belongs to you.

01:02.939 --> 01:05.608
I've done that to dozens of people,
and all of them got over it.

01:05.692 --> 01:07.777
Actually, none of your exes
have ever gotten over you.

01:07.944 --> 01:09.112
You're damn right they didn't.

01:09.445 --> 01:13.366
I just wish I could end things
in a way that I knew wouldn't hurt her.

01:13.658 --> 01:14.868
Bing!

01:15.869 --> 01:19.038
I usually appear out of thin air
and there would be a pleasant "bing" sound

01:19.080 --> 01:22.458
but I don't have my powers
so I'm doing my own "bings" now.

01:22.792 --> 01:23.710
Bing!

01:25.378 --> 01:27.922
Chidi, what if I could create
a virtual reality simulation

01:27.964 --> 01:29.883
where you could practice
different break-up scenarios?

01:29.924 --> 01:31.593
- You can do that?
- I think so.

01:31.718 --> 01:35.346
I do know everything about you, and Simone,
and computer programming

01:35.388 --> 01:37.348
and virtual reality
and artificial intelligence

01:37.390 --> 01:39.058
and the human brain and everything else.

01:39.184 --> 01:42.604
I'm kind of a nerd.
I'll start building the simulator now.

01:42.979 --> 01:43.897
Bing!

01:47.734 --> 01:48.651
Don't...

01:49.194 --> 01:50.069
Turn around.

01:50.820 --> 01:51.905
It's embarrassing.

01:53.239 --> 01:54.157
Bing!

02:03.708 --> 02:06.127
Jacksonville! What up!

02:06.544 --> 02:08.546
Duval!

02:08.671 --> 02:10.465
Duval!

02:10.632 --> 02:11.674
Poor Larry.

02:12.675 --> 02:13.593
But...

02:14.219 --> 02:16.930
"If you love someone, set them free."

02:17.472 --> 02:21.267
My good friend and yoga pupil Sting,
no last initial, told me that.

02:21.434 --> 02:24.187
I can't wait to show you guys
all the cool sights in Jacksonville.

02:24.229 --> 02:27.482
Like, that swamp is where me,
Pillboi and Donkey Doug

02:27.523 --> 02:30.360
used to stand and try and blind pilots
with laser pointers.

02:30.443 --> 02:33.238
- And, oh--
- Maybe we should do the tour after we...

02:33.363 --> 02:35.740
you know, save your father's soul.

02:35.823 --> 02:39.118
Oh, I've been meaning to ask,
why are you trying to save your father?

02:39.369 --> 02:42.330
I've heard you mention your friend Pillboi
many times

02:42.413 --> 02:43.790
but you've not mentioned your father once.

02:44.415 --> 02:47.543
What do you mean?
I talk about Donkey Doug all the time.

02:51.172 --> 02:52.173
I'm sorry...

02:52.465 --> 02:55.760
the man you call "Donkey Doug"
is your father?

02:56.052 --> 02:56.928
Yeah.

02:57.637 --> 03:01.724
The "Donkey Doug" with whom you tried
to blind airline pilots with laser pointers?

03:01.808 --> 03:02.684
Yeah.

03:02.725 --> 03:05.186
The "Donkey Doug" who is banned
from Disney World

03:05.228 --> 03:07.188
for biting Buzz Lightyear?

03:07.272 --> 03:10.149
In his defence,
he thought it was someone else.

03:11.567 --> 03:12.527
Who?

03:12.652 --> 03:15.780
So, Michael and I have
a plan to save my dad.

03:16.114 --> 03:18.992
My whole life,
Donkey Doug was always getting in trouble

03:19.033 --> 03:21.411
because of some get-rich-quick scheme.

03:21.536 --> 03:23.329
He sold counterfeit truck nutz

03:23.621 --> 03:26.958
he created a sport that was a cross between
dodgeball and horseshoes

03:27.000 --> 03:28.501
and everybody died.

03:28.584 --> 03:30.128
- He glued--
- This should be easy.

03:30.253 --> 03:31.921
We have plenty of money.

03:32.005 --> 03:36.759
If we just give him money, he'll blow it.
He's gotta feel like he did it himself.

03:36.884 --> 03:41.055
A few years ago, Donkey Doug was very close
to getting his electrician's licence.

03:41.097 --> 03:44.767
So, if we get him to finish the training,
he can earn an honest living

03:44.851 --> 03:47.437
and be on his way to getting more
Good Place points

03:47.478 --> 03:49.647
which is why we're all here.

03:49.731 --> 03:52.400
OK, let's go save ma dad!

03:52.734 --> 03:54.319
Taxi!

03:59.949 --> 04:01.868
- Ha!
- Need help with your bag?

04:01.951 --> 04:02.869
Nah, I got it!

04:06.247 --> 04:07.874
Oh, dip! Jason!

04:07.957 --> 04:09.334
Aw, dip! Donkey Doug!

04:09.959 --> 04:12.128
You call him "Donkey Doug" in person?

04:12.211 --> 04:13.629
Me and Jason are cool like that.

04:13.713 --> 04:17.633
I don't think of him as my son,
I think of him as ma boy!

04:17.717 --> 04:20.178
I mean, I am ya boy.

04:20.261 --> 04:21.596
Yeah, but it's more like...

04:21.679 --> 04:23.598
"That's my son right there, son!"

04:23.681 --> 04:28.394
But not, like, "son-son", but, like,
"ma boy". But not, like...

04:28.478 --> 04:30.521
Yes, Yes, we get it. Thank you.

04:30.563 --> 04:32.231
Oh, this is my friend, Michael.

04:32.648 --> 04:34.484
Aw, crap! You look like a cop!

04:34.567 --> 04:37.403
Are you a cop? Because if you are,
you have to tell me

04:37.487 --> 04:39.655
and you're not allowed to arrest me
for anything you saw

04:39.697 --> 04:41.324
before I knew you were a cop.

04:41.449 --> 04:44.202
- I'm not a police officer.
- Yeah, Michael's cool.

04:44.577 --> 04:47.663
And this is Tahani,
who is my wife, I guess.

04:47.747 --> 04:49.499
Dang, nice pull, son!

04:49.957 --> 04:53.419
How about you and me go check out my
Jacuzzi and put stuff in each other?

04:53.503 --> 04:55.546
Again, I'm his wife.

04:55.630 --> 04:56.547
Wow.

04:56.672 --> 04:59.133
That's the first time that line
has ever failed.

04:59.342 --> 05:01.094
You must really love him.

05:01.594 --> 05:04.305
Welcome to the family! Come on in!

05:04.889 --> 05:07.141
This programme knows everything
about your personality

05:07.225 --> 05:09.727
Simone's personality,
and all human relationships.

05:09.769 --> 05:13.981
It can't tell you exactly what will happen,
but it will approximate Simone's reaction

05:14.023 --> 05:15.274
to anything you say to her.

05:15.316 --> 05:17.568
Plus... it has Tetris!

05:17.652 --> 05:21.155
Hm. Would this work with, say, me,
and, say...

05:21.239 --> 05:24.117
uh, Jason Statham, and
uh, instead of a cafÃ©

05:24.200 --> 05:27.912
it was, say, a room with a futon
and a bunch of Red Bull?

05:27.995 --> 05:30.206
Why is it that every time a new thing
is invented

05:30.248 --> 05:32.875
humans immediately try to use it for porn?

05:33.000 --> 05:34.168
Because we're disgusting.

05:34.210 --> 05:36.629
Huh. Eleanor and I
will be watching on the monitor.

05:36.712 --> 05:38.714
We'll see what you see.
Put these in your ears.

05:38.756 --> 05:41.551
They'll play a tone that will trick your
brain into seeing what I've programmed.

05:47.223 --> 05:50.685
Wow! Uh, so, this is... I'm here.

05:50.810 --> 05:51.686
Hey, babe.

05:52.645 --> 05:53.896
What did you wanna talk about?

05:54.605 --> 05:56.524
<i>Go ahead, Chidi.
Practice what you want to say to her.</i>

05:56.607 --> 06:00.236
Right, um... Simone, this has been
the best year of my life

06:00.403 --> 06:01.571
because of you.

06:01.654 --> 06:05.116
Unfortunately,
I have come to learn some information

06:05.575 --> 06:09.579
and it means that we have to end
this relationship.

06:09.787 --> 06:12.957
- What information?
- I can't say.

06:13.166 --> 06:14.709
- Why not?
- Uh...

06:14.834 --> 06:16.294
I-I can't say.

06:16.377 --> 06:18.880
Well, you've either gone crazy
or you're too much of a coward

06:18.921 --> 06:22.175
- to tell me how you feel. Which is it?
- I-I can't, because of...

06:23.092 --> 06:24.343
Janet!

06:24.427 --> 06:26.679
Who's Janet? And why are you screaming
her name into the sky?

06:27.096 --> 06:28.848
You know what... whatever. Goodbye, Chidi.

06:28.931 --> 06:30.016
No, no, no, wait!

06:30.725 --> 06:32.477
So!

06:33.352 --> 06:35.354
- That didn't go great.
- I disagree!

06:35.521 --> 06:37.273
I thought it was hilarious.

06:37.648 --> 06:38.941
So, Donkey Doug...

06:39.066 --> 06:43.905
Jason told us about your electrician licence,
and we have a career opportunity for you.

06:43.988 --> 06:45.698
Yo! Later for that.

06:45.948 --> 06:48.701
I got a business proposition for you.

06:49.035 --> 06:50.369
Pillboi!

06:51.829 --> 06:54.415
- Oh, dip! Jason!
- Oh, dip! Pillboi!

06:54.457 --> 06:56.876
- Oh, dip! Pillboi!
- Oh, dip! Donkey Doug!

06:57.001 --> 06:59.128
This is remarkable.

06:59.212 --> 07:01.589
It explains so much.

07:01.631 --> 07:02.965
Jason, I thought you were dead!

07:03.007 --> 07:06.594
But I was alive! I was in Australia.
I talked to you on the phone last week!

07:06.802 --> 07:08.179
Yeah, but I forgot!

07:08.262 --> 07:09.138
Oh...!

07:09.472 --> 07:13.100
Me and Pillboi have been cooking up
something real special.

07:13.309 --> 07:15.853
And this time, it's not fake meth.

07:17.355 --> 07:20.399
Alright, Pillboi,
tell him about our new product!

07:20.608 --> 07:25.154
Sharks, how much do you spend on
energy drinks and body spray in one week?

07:25.404 --> 07:26.489
$300?

07:26.739 --> 07:27.949
Ten hundred dollars?

07:28.449 --> 07:32.119
What if I told you there was a product
that combined these two things

07:32.203 --> 07:36.624
for one solution to all of life's problems
and more?

07:36.999 --> 07:39.585
I give to you, "Double Trouble."

07:39.669 --> 07:43.256
The world's first
energy drink-slash-body spray.

07:43.422 --> 07:47.051
So, uh, do you spray it on yourself
or do you drink it?

07:47.176 --> 07:48.219
You both it!

07:48.427 --> 07:51.639
This is the one, Jason!
We're gonna be so rich.

07:51.847 --> 07:55.810
I'll finally be able to pay to have my
calf implants moved back up from my feet!

07:56.185 --> 07:57.853
This is gonna be a lot tougher
than we thought.

07:58.563 --> 08:01.023
Tell me about it.
"Double Trouble" sounds amazing!

08:01.107 --> 08:03.985
We should bid fast,
the other Sharks are gonna want in.

08:06.612 --> 08:10.408
So, I just have to be simple, honest,
and declarative

08:10.491 --> 08:12.785
and somehow still protect her feelings.

08:12.827 --> 08:13.828
I don't know, man.

08:13.911 --> 08:15.955
- Maybe just tell her that you're gay.
- I'm not gay.

08:16.038 --> 08:17.331
Fine, bi.

08:17.540 --> 08:19.125
- I'm not bi either.
- Why not?

08:19.208 --> 08:23.462
More guys should be bi.
It's 2018, it's like, get over yourselves!

08:23.546 --> 08:27.550
Is there any way I can try
a bunch of different things in a row

08:27.592 --> 08:28.718
to see what works?

08:28.801 --> 08:29.802
Bing! Sure.

08:29.927 --> 08:31.846
If you want to reset,
just snap your fingers.

08:31.929 --> 08:35.850
Also, I made some modifications to the tone,
so it should make your transition easier.

08:35.933 --> 08:36.809
Oh.

08:43.733 --> 08:44.900
Hey, babe.

08:46.027 --> 08:47.153
What did you want to talk about?

08:47.236 --> 08:49.363
Well, I don't love you anymore.

08:49.530 --> 08:50.406
What?

08:50.448 --> 08:51.991
No, no, you don't understand.

08:52.325 --> 08:58.205
I don't technically love you in the same way,
because of circumstances.

08:58.956 --> 08:59.832
What?

09:00.416 --> 09:01.334
Hang on.

09:03.878 --> 09:07.089
I don't know how to tell you this,
but I'm dying.

09:07.423 --> 09:09.091
- No, you're not.
- Yes, I am.

09:09.258 --> 09:12.303
Because we're all dying, slowly,
when you think about it.

09:12.428 --> 09:16.098
We start dying the moment we're born,
so, not a lie.

09:18.434 --> 09:20.478
OK, here it is.

09:20.561 --> 09:22.396
I'm just going to be perfectly honest.

09:23.397 --> 09:26.442
My real name
is Special Agent Rick Justice, FBI.

09:27.568 --> 09:28.527
Nope.

09:30.738 --> 09:31.656
Simone...

09:32.657 --> 09:38.162
the last year has been truly amazing.
And with that in mind...

09:40.956 --> 09:42.625
Will you marry me?

09:42.667 --> 09:43.542
Yes!

09:43.668 --> 09:46.170
Yes, of course I will! Oh!

09:48.464 --> 09:51.217
Wait, what-what am I doing?
Why did I think this would work?

09:51.258 --> 09:53.177
<i>Chidi, I'm gonna go ahead
and reboot this one myself.</i>

09:53.219 --> 09:54.095
Yeah, good call.

09:54.595 --> 09:56.305
- So, Simone--
- Wait.

09:56.639 --> 09:59.558
Before you say anything,
I think we should break up.

10:00.142 --> 10:01.310
- You do?
- Yes.

10:01.352 --> 10:04.980
I love and respect you very much,
but we're heading in different directions.

10:05.356 --> 10:07.274
And don't worry, we don't have to make
a big "thing" of it.

10:07.775 --> 10:09.694
Oh, my God. OK. This is the one.

10:09.777 --> 10:11.362
Remember everything,
right leg crossed over left.

10:11.404 --> 10:12.488
Coffee's right there...

10:12.780 --> 10:13.781
Oh, one more thing.

10:14.031 --> 10:16.075
Suck it, ya doink!

10:16.575 --> 10:18.244
Sorry?

10:18.327 --> 10:20.329
This is Eleanor, you idiot!

10:20.413 --> 10:22.623
Janet let me mess with the simulator
to screw with you!

10:22.665 --> 10:23.624
Janet, come on!

10:23.666 --> 10:25.751
Hi, Chidi, this is Janet now.

10:25.835 --> 10:27.628
- Sorry, it won't happen again.
- Thank you!

10:27.670 --> 10:29.255
Psych! It's still Eleanor!

10:29.338 --> 10:32.591
I can't believe you fell for that, ya doink!

10:33.342 --> 10:34.260
We need to break up

10:34.301 --> 10:36.679
but here's a puppy!

10:36.721 --> 10:38.347
Aw! Wait, what?

10:38.431 --> 10:41.225
He's a puppy, it's over between us,
and he's cute!

10:41.267 --> 10:43.644
Do you think I don't hear the bad parts
of these sentences?

10:43.686 --> 10:46.147
His name is Martin, I need my keys back,
and he's a puppy!

10:47.773 --> 10:49.525
You are very bad at this.

10:49.567 --> 10:51.777
Well, it's because I don't actually
want to break up with her!

10:51.819 --> 10:53.779
What, do you need me to break up
with her for you

10:53.821 --> 10:57.116
- like we're in middle school or something?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yes.

10:57.324 --> 10:59.577
- Please do that for me, please!
- Fine.

11:02.288 --> 11:03.414
Hey, Eleanor!

11:03.748 --> 11:04.623
Hey.

11:05.040 --> 11:06.500
What did you want to talk about?

11:06.709 --> 11:09.920
Well, first of all,
you and Chidi are so great together.

11:10.087 --> 11:12.757
He really loves you, and I can see why,
you know?

11:12.840 --> 11:15.050
You're brilliant, charming,
obviously gorgeous.

11:15.134 --> 11:16.761
Aww, you're sweet to say that.

11:16.802 --> 11:19.346
- And your accent is so cute!
- Your accent is so cute.

11:19.764 --> 11:21.682
What? I don't think I have an accent.

11:21.891 --> 11:23.517
I don't think I have an accent.

11:23.559 --> 11:25.853
Stop it!

11:31.525 --> 11:35.529
What... is... happening?

11:37.990 --> 11:38.908
<i>Nope. No.</i>

11:38.949 --> 11:39.825
This is over.

11:39.909 --> 11:42.453
Whoa, man, come on!
It was just getting good!

11:42.995 --> 11:44.455
Let's remember the mission.

11:44.622 --> 11:48.250
Your father needs to focus
on long-term stability.

11:48.709 --> 11:50.669
Also, and perhaps this is less important

11:50.753 --> 11:55.508
but there's an awful lot of dog hair
on the furniture, and I have not seen a dog.

11:56.133 --> 11:57.259
Not bad, right?

11:57.843 --> 12:00.805
"Double Trouble" comes in three
delicious smell-flavours.

12:01.055 --> 12:04.183
Raspberry-Perspirant, Cedarwood Melon Blast

12:04.475 --> 12:07.686
and 24-Hour Lemon Musk Xtreme.

12:07.937 --> 12:10.147
That one is also a lube.

12:10.231 --> 12:13.359
Look, Donkey Doug,
"Double Trouble" is dope.

12:13.484 --> 12:15.569
On that much, we can all agree on.

12:15.861 --> 12:17.988
But you got to think long-term.

12:18.447 --> 12:20.241
You were good at electricity stuff.

12:20.366 --> 12:24.495
You hooked us up with free porno channels
every year, ever since the third grade.

12:24.578 --> 12:25.913
It's good honest work.

12:25.996 --> 12:27.915
"Honest work?" Whatever, Dad.

12:28.499 --> 12:30.125
You're <i>his</i> dad.

12:30.626 --> 12:32.461
This is huge, J!

12:32.795 --> 12:36.590
When "Double Trouble" pops off, I'll be
able to quit my job at the old folks' home.

12:36.799 --> 12:38.425
Buy a big-ass mansion.

12:38.759 --> 12:42.137
Every day I'd wake up, get out of bed,
brush my teeth

12:42.263 --> 12:45.349
rinse, go downstairs, open the fridge

12:45.432 --> 12:47.476
Damn, we outta milk. Get in my car...

12:47.560 --> 12:50.604
You don't have to run through
the whole imaginary day.

12:50.688 --> 12:54.775
Jason, I believe in "Double Trouble."
Why won't you believe in me?

12:58.028 --> 12:58.988
Well...

12:59.113 --> 13:02.908
I suppose a little entrepreneurial spirit
never hurt anyone.

13:03.325 --> 13:07.288
You know, "Reach for the stars,"
as I said to my good friend Elon Musk.

13:08.122 --> 13:09.999
And then he shot his car into space.

13:10.916 --> 13:13.168
What a weird creep.
Why was I friends with him?

13:13.502 --> 13:16.755
Maybe this is what'll put your father
on the right path.

13:16.881 --> 13:19.842
And hey, it's not like he's robbing a bank.

13:19.967 --> 13:21.886
Yeah. It's a factory!

13:23.262 --> 13:24.138
Excuse me?

13:24.179 --> 13:27.308
Tonight, we're gonna steal some energy
drinks from an energy drink factory

13:27.391 --> 13:29.226
then steal some cologne
from a cologne factory

13:29.268 --> 13:31.437
so, it's actually two factories.

13:31.687 --> 13:33.772
Then we just gotta bottle it all up!

13:33.814 --> 13:36.108
Aw, dip, we gotta rob a bottle factory.

13:36.233 --> 13:38.235
- Three factories.
- Three factories.

13:39.111 --> 13:43.282
Stupid Donkey Doug!
I mean, two factories I can understand

13:43.324 --> 13:44.366
but... but three?

13:44.867 --> 13:49.997
You might want to consider the possibility
that your father's a lost cause.

13:51.165 --> 13:53.542
I have an idea, but I need your help.

13:53.876 --> 13:55.044
Will you guys help me?

13:56.337 --> 13:59.214
I mean, yeah, that...
that's why we're here, Jason.

13:59.298 --> 14:00.299
What's your idea, darling?

14:00.674 --> 14:02.927
We're gonna save Pillboi.

14:05.220 --> 14:07.514
OK, real life. I think I'm ready.

14:07.681 --> 14:10.184
I've analysed the ten
most successful scenarios

14:10.225 --> 14:12.728
and compiled the statistically
most effective break-up strategy.

14:12.895 --> 14:15.689
- Who said you weren't a romantic?
- Every girlfriend I've ever had.

14:15.773 --> 14:18.067
Oh, there she is! OK, wish me luck.

14:23.072 --> 14:24.490
Oh. Hi. Uh...

14:24.698 --> 14:25.741
Something wrong?

14:25.866 --> 14:27.952
Er, no, it's just that
we're usually over there.

14:29.370 --> 14:30.412
Doesn't matter.

14:31.497 --> 14:36.961
OK, so I've spent a lot of time thinking
about everything that's happened

14:37.002 --> 14:38.253
- in the last year--
- Hi there!

14:38.295 --> 14:39.463
What can I get you to drink?

14:39.588 --> 14:41.840
- Uh, I'll have an iced tea, please.
- Water, thanks.

14:42.341 --> 14:43.217
Um...

14:43.509 --> 14:46.762
It's been a time of massive personal
and professional growth...

14:46.804 --> 14:49.306
- Sorry, sugar with that iced tea?
- Yes, please.

14:49.598 --> 14:52.309
Um, all in all,
it's been overwhelmingly positive

14:52.351 --> 14:54.895
and I think that's due
in large part to you.

14:54.937 --> 14:58.232
Sorry, real quick. I'm gonna go on break,
so Helmut will be taking care of you.

14:58.399 --> 15:01.193
Hello! Will you be eating with us today?

15:01.235 --> 15:03.445
- Just, please, give us one second!
<i>- Ja,</i> OK.

15:03.988 --> 15:06.949
One! That was one second.
Ha-ha, that was a joke!

15:06.991 --> 15:08.826
- Please get out of here, Helmut!
- OK, <i>ja.</i>

15:09.076 --> 15:11.245
Alright, look.
Just, um, we need to break up.

15:11.412 --> 15:13.497
- I am... I am breaking up with you!
- Why?

15:13.539 --> 15:16.166
I can't... It's... I ju--
It's... it's complicated.

15:16.250 --> 15:18.377
But it's happening. Ya dumped!

15:20.671 --> 15:21.839
- OK.
- Wait.

15:22.089 --> 15:23.132
Wait, no...

15:23.549 --> 15:24.883
Come back. Please.

15:25.300 --> 15:26.468
<i>Ja,</i> OK, I'm back!

15:26.552 --> 15:28.012
Not you, Helmut!

15:31.306 --> 15:32.182
Hey.

15:32.266 --> 15:36.353
Now listen, Judy. You can't mix Xannys
with these lil' pink fools.

15:36.603 --> 15:40.274
You'll be tripping balls like Clarence was
when he crawled into the ice machine.

15:40.315 --> 15:41.775
Here.

15:42.443 --> 15:46.613
Take half of one of these,
wash it down with a five-hour energy

15:46.697 --> 15:49.992
and you'll be golden.
Body high with mild visuals.

15:50.325 --> 15:51.952
Thanks, Pillboi.

15:52.411 --> 15:55.831
Yo, I gotta take off,
cos I gotta go do a robbery.

15:56.665 --> 15:58.834
I mean... I'm sick.

16:01.712 --> 16:04.506
Hello, Pillboi.
I'm here on behalf of Jason.

16:04.923 --> 16:09.053
You won't be attending the... job,
with Donkey Doug today.

16:09.136 --> 16:10.471
There's been a change of plans.

16:11.597 --> 16:12.473
OK.

16:13.974 --> 16:14.933
That's it?

16:15.517 --> 16:17.519
You don't need any more information?

16:17.644 --> 16:19.480
I mean, do you wanna tell me?

16:19.646 --> 16:20.689
Not really.

16:20.856 --> 16:21.732
Cool.

16:22.649 --> 16:23.817
Want some pills?

16:26.570 --> 16:28.614
I hate this! What if I ruined her?

16:28.655 --> 16:31.158
What if I sent her down the wrong path
and she ends up in the Bad Place?

16:31.492 --> 16:34.244
I have to undo what I did.
Janet, fire up the simulator.

16:34.328 --> 16:37.998
Dude! No more simulations,
just talk to her.

16:38.082 --> 16:42.669
Break-ups never end with both people
feeling great, but she's a badass

16:42.753 --> 16:45.881
and her world is bigger
than your relationship.

16:46.006 --> 16:47.633
She'll recover.

16:47.925 --> 16:49.134
Just... Go.

16:49.551 --> 16:51.011
Be a person.

16:51.637 --> 16:52.513
Right.

16:53.472 --> 16:54.431
Here I go.

16:57.476 --> 16:59.728
Janet, can I use the simulator?

16:59.812 --> 17:03.607
There's a very specific Lenny Kravitz
concert I wanna be front row at.

17:03.732 --> 17:08.445
Sure. FYI, when the system boots up,
you might find yourself in a steam room

17:08.529 --> 17:11.532
with Jason, who will be wearing
an old-timey strongman onesie.

17:11.615 --> 17:13.909
It's a... bug in the system.

17:17.246 --> 17:18.205
Pillboi?

17:18.747 --> 17:19.957
No, it's me.

17:20.040 --> 17:23.210
Pillboi's friend, Jason.
Pillboi's not coming.

17:23.252 --> 17:26.338
If you're here to tell me an energy drink
body spray is a bad idea

17:26.421 --> 17:27.589
I've heard it before.

17:27.673 --> 17:29.424
From a bank, and some doctors.

17:29.466 --> 17:33.887
I'mma help you make "Double Trouble" but
you gotta leave Pillboi alone from now on.

17:34.012 --> 17:35.556
I'm trying to save him.

17:35.597 --> 17:38.934
Oh, dip. You got religious and shizz?

17:39.184 --> 17:40.144
Amen.

17:40.769 --> 17:41.728
Amen.

17:41.812 --> 17:43.856
OK, hurry up and get this crap in my truck.

17:45.440 --> 17:48.735
<i>Jacksonville Police.
Come out with your hands up.</i>

17:48.944 --> 17:52.156
Are you a cop?
Cos if you are, you have to tell us!

17:52.406 --> 17:54.741
<i>Yes, this is the police.</i>

17:54.825 --> 17:57.536
- Yup, I knew it, it's the cops!
- Well, what do we do?

17:57.828 --> 17:59.413
- Yo, let's get out of here.
- No.

18:00.664 --> 18:03.333
I know I haven't been the best father
in the world.

18:03.667 --> 18:05.961
I might not have even been in the top five.

18:06.461 --> 18:10.632
I wanna make up for that.
I'll distract 'em, you run out the back.

18:10.716 --> 18:11.633
No, that's crazy.

18:11.675 --> 18:14.386
It's what my dad did for me,
and his dad for him

18:14.595 --> 18:17.973
and some day, you'll do this exact thing
for your son.

18:18.098 --> 18:20.058
I mean, I hope not.

18:20.475 --> 18:22.769
But thanks, Donkey Doug.

18:22.853 --> 18:23.812
Hey.

18:24.563 --> 18:26.523
- Call me "Donkey Dad".
- OK.

18:27.608 --> 18:28.984
Donkey Dad.

18:29.234 --> 18:32.070
Nah, that sounds wack! Call me Donkey Doug!

18:32.905 --> 18:33.822
Cool.

18:38.619 --> 18:40.662
Bortles!

18:48.337 --> 18:49.421
Uh...

18:51.673 --> 18:53.717
Here's the truth. You're amazing.

18:54.968 --> 18:57.304
And my feelings have changed.

18:57.346 --> 19:01.516
I wish I could tell you why,
I really, really do.

19:01.808 --> 19:02.851
But...

19:04.728 --> 19:05.854
I can't.

19:07.064 --> 19:08.023
Well...

19:09.233 --> 19:13.070
You seem to know what you want,
which is rare for you.

19:13.612 --> 19:16.448
Well, I... I...
I hope you keep the study going.

19:18.158 --> 19:19.952
It might help a lot of people.

19:21.453 --> 19:22.371
Well.

19:23.330 --> 19:24.957
- See you in the next life.
- What?

19:24.998 --> 19:26.375
Why would you say that? What do you know?

19:27.292 --> 19:28.752
It's a figure of speech.

19:29.211 --> 19:31.171
You're so weird, man.

19:31.213 --> 19:33.173
I think maybe this is for the best.

19:34.967 --> 19:39.179
So, your covert mission is to continue
to report to this job

19:39.221 --> 19:41.640
until you receive our signal.

19:41.765 --> 19:44.268
Now, this is the most important thing.

19:44.685 --> 19:47.437
You cannot commit any more crimes

19:47.854 --> 19:52.234
and you must help these people
as much as you can.

19:52.859 --> 19:54.361
The mission depends on it.

19:54.444 --> 19:55.445
Roger that.

19:55.570 --> 19:58.198
Man, I can't believe this whole time

19:58.323 --> 20:00.117
you guys were with NASA!

20:00.367 --> 20:03.870
Yes, we are secret astronaut spies.

20:04.329 --> 20:06.123
That is indeed what Jason told you.

20:07.457 --> 20:11.545
Take good care of these old fools,
and stay out of trouble.

20:12.462 --> 20:13.880
I love you, bro.

20:14.256 --> 20:15.674
I love you, bro.

20:25.642 --> 20:27.144
- Psych!
- I got you, bro!

20:27.269 --> 20:28.312
I got you, bro.

20:28.437 --> 20:29.396
- Jag...
- ...uars

20:29.438 --> 20:30.314
Rule!

20:38.989 --> 20:41.325
Well, my sister's museum exhibit
opens tomorrow.

20:41.408 --> 20:44.786
Are you all ready for some Al-Jamil
family reconciliation?

20:44.870 --> 20:45.871
You know it, wifey!

20:45.954 --> 20:47.331
Soul Squad is on a roll!

20:47.664 --> 20:51.585
I pretty much nailed that Pillboi thing,
and I got closure with my dad, Donkey Doug.

20:51.752 --> 20:54.921
That remains depressing.
But I'm happy for you, bud.

20:55.297 --> 20:57.591
I never got to do that with my parents,
and now they're both dead

20:57.632 --> 20:59.343
so it's impossible.

21:00.385 --> 21:02.387
So, the thing is...

21:02.512 --> 21:06.641
one of your parents is not technically,
actually...

21:07.142 --> 21:08.101
dead.

21:08.602 --> 21:09.603
What are you talking about?

21:09.644 --> 21:13.482
Your mother's alive.
She faked her own death.

21:15.192 --> 21:18.612
I'm sorry, Tahani, I don't think I'll be
able to stay with you here in Budapest.

21:19.154 --> 21:23.241
Turns out my mum isn't dead,
so I need to fly back to America

21:23.367 --> 21:25.243
to murder her.
