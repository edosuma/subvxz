00:39.873 --> 00:44.127
<i>Hoping to break the spell
that had destroyed her chance for true love,</i>

00:44.211 --> 00:50.300
<i>Princess Mei Li secretly sailed from Cathay
to the kingdom of the Swan Princess.</i>

00:50.384 --> 00:54.471
<i>Indeed, her wish came true,
and the spell was broken.</i>

00:55.472 --> 01:01.645
<i>The tale of how that spell was first cast
had been too sad to tell before now.</i>

01:02.646 --> 01:05.941
<i>But it is also a story that is not over,</i>

01:06.024 --> 01:12.447
<i>as Princess Mei Li will desperately need
the help of the Swan Princess once more.</i>

01:14.074 --> 01:16.535
It's beautiful.

01:16.618 --> 01:19.121
But you are being far too generous.

01:19.204 --> 01:20.789
Impossible.

01:20.873 --> 01:25.919
I could paint for a thousand years
and never capture your beauty.

01:38.015 --> 01:40.934
- You're coming with us!
- Take your hands off me!

01:41.018 --> 01:43.645
What are you doing? Wait! Stop!

01:43.729 --> 01:45.063
I command you...!

01:47.357 --> 01:49.067
Father!

01:57.451 --> 01:58.911
Father, no!

01:59.912 --> 02:01.330
No!

02:02.956 --> 02:06.084
Chen, I'm so sorry.

02:10.506 --> 02:12.466
Chen!

02:15.969 --> 02:17.554
How could you let her?

02:27.064 --> 02:29.775
I always wondered how it happened.

02:29.858 --> 02:32.736
It was too painful to share until now.

02:32.819 --> 02:36.949
Well, thanks to Prince Li,
it's all in the past.

02:37.032 --> 02:41.954
Now you can go home and marry
and be happy forever.

02:43.247 --> 02:45.999
- Mei Li?
- That's just it.

02:46.083 --> 02:49.586
What if Father still refuses
to let us marry?

02:49.670 --> 02:53.298
What if Fang casts another spell?

02:53.382 --> 02:56.718
I want to ask a hard thing.

02:56.802 --> 02:59.513
Then, please, ask.

02:59.596 --> 03:03.934
Can we stay here, Chen and I?

03:05.060 --> 03:05.936
Oh, I...

03:07.145 --> 03:10.274
Forgive me. It is too much to ask.

03:10.357 --> 03:14.695
Well, will you be truly happy here?

03:16.572 --> 03:19.533
I know if I had to live
so far away from home,

03:19.616 --> 03:22.703
I'd miss it terribly.

03:24.454 --> 03:26.290
I know you are right.

03:27.499 --> 03:29.042
But maybe...

03:30.043 --> 03:31.587
Go home with Mei Li?

03:31.670 --> 03:35.549
We did interfere, and we should explain why.

03:36.550 --> 03:40.554
Alise and Lucas are in Borromeo
for the tulip festival.

03:40.637 --> 03:42.931
And if we don't go?

03:43.015 --> 03:46.059
The emperor may not let them marry.

03:46.143 --> 03:49.146
I always said I'd follow you
to the ends of the earth.

03:49.229 --> 03:51.190
Ends of the earth...

03:51.273 --> 03:53.275
here we come!

03:54.359 --> 03:57.321
I haven't done that since I was a kid.

04:04.536 --> 04:07.581
You won the Swan Princess Music Festival!

04:07.664 --> 04:09.499
Father will be so proud of you.

04:11.126 --> 04:12.252
Thank you.

04:13.253 --> 04:17.423
You really loved her, didn't you?

04:17.507 --> 04:20.260
Alise will always be very special to me.

04:20.344 --> 04:24.681
Your sacrifice gave Chen and me
a chance for love.

04:24.765 --> 04:28.018
We will never forget that. Never.

04:28.101 --> 04:30.687
You are very noble, Li.

04:31.688 --> 04:36.276
Well, I suppose this is goodbye...

04:36.360 --> 04:38.487
forever!

04:39.488 --> 04:41.949
Mother, you had a bad dream.
That's all it was.

04:42.032 --> 04:45.410
No. It was a premonition!

04:45.494 --> 04:47.871
You sailed to a faraway place,

04:47.955 --> 04:50.290
and you never returned!

04:50.374 --> 04:54.711
You had a child named Yippity Skippity.

04:54.795 --> 04:57.965
See, that's how you know
it was a dream, Mother.

04:58.048 --> 05:02.553
So I created this scrapbook for him,

05:02.636 --> 05:06.139
for my little Yippity Skippity.

05:06.223 --> 05:08.392
"All About Uberta."

05:08.475 --> 05:15.232
So he'll know something
about his poor grandmama.

05:15.315 --> 05:20.404
It's very nice, Mother,
but we'll be back, I promise.

05:21.697 --> 05:23.073
Goodbye!

05:23.156 --> 05:25.784
Don't you know it's bad luck to say goodbye

05:25.868 --> 05:29.997
- to someone getting on a boat?
- Nonsense. They'll be safe.

05:30.080 --> 05:31.957
Salt over the shoulder.

05:32.040 --> 05:33.750
Knock on wood.

05:33.834 --> 05:35.377
Pinch a frog.

05:35.460 --> 05:38.422
Hey, you made that last one up!

05:43.051 --> 05:46.096
I hope we're doing the right thing.

06:30.682 --> 06:33.560
Ru! Please join us!

06:33.644 --> 06:38.565
Now that home is so close,
I have a gift for you.

06:39.900 --> 06:41.610
I love it!

06:41.693 --> 06:46.365
Oh, Ru, you've always been so kind to me.

06:46.448 --> 06:49.535
It has been the honor of my life.

06:49.618 --> 06:53.038
Wedding veils must be very special.

06:53.121 --> 06:54.540
Oh, yes.

06:54.623 --> 06:56.834
I'll wear it the day we're married.

06:57.835 --> 07:01.129
Then the royal monk will
invite them to kneel.

07:04.716 --> 07:08.387
Then he'll ask me to lift the veil.

07:09.388 --> 07:12.140
And the very moment your eyes meet,

07:12.224 --> 07:14.560
you are joined forever.

07:17.771 --> 07:20.774
Oh, I can't wait to see it.

07:20.858 --> 07:22.568
You will...

07:22.651 --> 07:24.653
if Father will let us.

07:26.864 --> 07:28.949
Looks like we'll find out soon.

07:29.950 --> 07:31.743
Home.

07:36.540 --> 07:39.251
Okay, let's review the plan.

07:39.334 --> 07:44.047
When we get there,
Mei Li and Chen will stay on the yacht.

07:44.131 --> 07:47.259
Below deck. Out of sight.

07:53.473 --> 07:57.519
Divine Emperor, Li has returned.

07:57.603 --> 08:00.189
He flies the flag of victory,

08:00.272 --> 08:02.524
just as my tea leaves predicted.

08:02.608 --> 08:05.652
Your tea leaves were right again.

08:09.072 --> 08:11.241
Good job, Fang!

08:11.325 --> 08:12.868
Note to self:

08:12.951 --> 08:16.121
Remind the emperor of my skills more often.

08:16.205 --> 08:18.749
I give myself an eight on that one.

08:18.832 --> 08:21.126
No, no, no, 8.5!

08:21.210 --> 08:24.213
Eight point five, for sure!

08:27.299 --> 08:30.719
Your tea leaves have proven
to be of great value.

08:43.065 --> 08:45.359
Divine Emperor.

08:45.442 --> 08:49.321
Your son, Prince Li,
has returned with honor.

08:49.404 --> 08:51.240
Indeed he has.

08:51.323 --> 08:55.077
My son, I am so, so proud.

08:55.160 --> 08:56.995
Thank you, Father.

08:57.079 --> 08:58.997
And you bring guests.

08:59.081 --> 09:03.669
The Swan Princess, Odette,
and the Crown Prince Derek.

09:06.755 --> 09:10.467
Will you grant a private moment
to the prince and princess?

09:10.551 --> 09:12.678
I would be delighted.

09:17.307 --> 09:20.185
They've requested a private moment, Fang.

09:24.273 --> 09:27.234
It is such an honor to meet you both.

09:27.317 --> 09:29.444
We know your story well.

09:29.528 --> 09:32.030
We are flattered, dear emperor.

09:32.114 --> 09:34.533
The Swan Princess.

09:34.616 --> 09:37.286
And the prince
who could only see her beauty.

09:37.369 --> 09:41.665
Well, yes, but I also defeated
the Great Animal.

09:41.748 --> 09:43.500
So there's that too.

09:43.584 --> 09:46.920
Dear emperor, a gift from us.

09:50.174 --> 09:52.801
It's beautiful.

09:52.885 --> 09:55.012
- It is...?
- A poem.

09:56.054 --> 09:59.099
- And the poet?
- Well, me.

09:59.183 --> 10:01.518
For better or worse.

10:01.602 --> 10:03.896
Better, I am sure.

10:03.979 --> 10:06.773
Will you do the kindness
of reciting it for me?

10:06.857 --> 10:09.693
I'd be most honored.

10:13.822 --> 10:18.869
<i>She is like me
This brave swallow, Mei Li</i>

10:18.952 --> 10:21.330
<i>Just as I once flew</i>

10:21.413 --> 10:24.625
<i>So she winged through my window one night</i>

10:24.708 --> 10:27.377
My Mei Li? How?

10:27.461 --> 10:31.715
<i>At first she came by sea
My friend, Mei Li</i>

10:31.798 --> 10:37.221
<i>Ten thousand miles afloat
Stowed away on her brother's boat</i>

10:37.304 --> 10:41.141
So that's where Mei Li... You took her in.

10:41.225 --> 10:43.310
You should have returned her to me.

10:43.393 --> 10:46.104
I have a bad feeling.

10:46.188 --> 10:48.023
We should have stayed.

10:48.106 --> 10:50.651
My father will not be pleased.

10:50.734 --> 10:55.489
<i>And her love did follow
That tiny, brave swallow</i>

10:55.572 --> 10:57.908
<i>Into my room that night</i>

10:57.991 --> 11:00.827
Chen? I must tell Fang!

11:00.911 --> 11:05.499
<i>For the earth holds no ocean
That could keep his devotion</i>

11:05.582 --> 11:08.919
<i>From the swallow I met that night</i>

11:10.212 --> 11:15.592
<i>Mei Li spoke of pain
And worse, a father's anger</i>

11:16.927 --> 11:20.597
<i>And a sorcerer's curse</i>

11:20.681 --> 11:24.726
<i>But she is like me
My friend, Mei Li</i>

11:24.810 --> 11:28.730
<i>An act of devotion without compare</i>

11:28.814 --> 11:33.026
<i>Released her love
From the sorcerer's snare</i>

11:33.110 --> 11:35.112
The spell is broken?

11:35.195 --> 11:38.156
<i>'Twas a gift of love from him</i>

11:38.240 --> 11:41.034
<i>No other than her friend</i>

11:41.118 --> 11:42.369
<i>Her brother</i>

11:43.370 --> 11:45.038
<i>Her twin</i>

11:46.039 --> 11:48.959
So where is she? Is she okay?

11:49.042 --> 11:52.713
Fang, you silly dumpling!

11:52.796 --> 11:56.466
You couldn't see
the twin brother could break the spell too?

11:56.550 --> 11:59.303
You get one measly point for that, Fang.

12:00.345 --> 12:02.681
Ru, send the signal!

12:02.764 --> 12:04.558
It's not only safe to return,

12:04.641 --> 12:07.144
they shall marry and live in the palace!

12:31.168 --> 12:33.504
Mei Li and Chen cannot be found.

12:33.587 --> 12:35.631
Oh, no. She lost hope.

12:35.714 --> 12:39.259
Send all guards, all resources to find her!

12:39.343 --> 12:42.137
She must know how sorry I am.

12:42.221 --> 12:43.805
I'll go with them.

12:48.101 --> 12:50.103
Are you sure you know the way?

12:50.187 --> 12:52.981
My father and I hunted there
many summers.

12:53.982 --> 12:58.654
It's very far, but no one will ever find us.

13:00.781 --> 13:05.035
Please, ancient ones, holy ancestors...

13:05.118 --> 13:06.787
find Mei Li.

13:06.870 --> 13:09.248
Bring her home to me.

13:11.416 --> 13:15.045
I used to feel so close to the ancestors.

13:15.128 --> 13:16.547
But now...

13:16.630 --> 13:18.465
they feel so distant.

13:19.508 --> 13:22.803
I can only assume
they are displeased with me

13:22.886 --> 13:27.349
for allowing the spell to be cast on Chen.

13:31.812 --> 13:33.814
We're getting close to the bridge.

13:33.897 --> 13:36.984
Three days from our new home.

13:41.154 --> 13:42.406
Fang?

13:42.489 --> 13:44.283
Come on.

13:56.587 --> 13:59.923
Can't have the princess leaving the kingdom.

14:02.342 --> 14:04.011
No!

14:11.602 --> 14:13.353
Mei Li!

14:13.437 --> 14:14.688
It was you?

14:14.771 --> 14:17.024
- Wait.
- We're not going back.

14:17.107 --> 14:19.276
- No, listen...
- Li, just let us go!

14:19.359 --> 14:21.612
Father gives you his blessing.

14:22.696 --> 14:24.781
- Truly?
- Truly.

14:24.865 --> 14:26.325
Oh, Mei Li.

14:26.408 --> 14:28.452
- We're going to be...
- So happy.

14:28.535 --> 14:32.581
- No! Married.
- Oh, right. But happy too.

14:32.664 --> 14:35.042
Yes! So happy.

14:39.880 --> 14:41.507
- I like that!
- Yeah?

14:41.590 --> 14:44.927
- It's our victory song.
- We'll teach you.

14:49.973 --> 14:51.475
There, you try.

14:55.729 --> 15:00.150
When the battle is over,
not when the battle's lost.

15:08.867 --> 15:12.746
I sang "standing taller,"
not "growing taller."

15:30.848 --> 15:33.559
A hero, not a bear!

15:33.642 --> 15:35.769
Let's just sing it in English.

15:35.853 --> 15:40.315
<i>When the battle's over
And you're standing a little taller</i>

15:40.399 --> 15:45.863
<i>When the final flag has flown
Your heart beating like a drum</i>

15:45.946 --> 15:47.781
Foolish girl!

15:47.865 --> 15:50.701
You would have ruined my plans,
had you escaped.

15:51.869 --> 15:55.873
Say what you've come to say
and be on your way, Fang.

15:55.956 --> 15:59.710
You will never marry Chen.

15:59.793 --> 16:04.047
Why are you so determined
to ruin our happiness? Why?

16:04.131 --> 16:07.968
Because Chen will be mine.

16:09.178 --> 16:10.804
You love Chen?

16:12.181 --> 16:13.682
Yes.

16:13.765 --> 16:16.059
And I will be his wife.

16:16.143 --> 16:18.103
Why would Chen choose you?

16:18.187 --> 16:21.398
I have a better question, princess.

16:21.481 --> 16:23.442
Why would Chen choose you?

16:29.198 --> 16:31.617
You will grow weaker each day,

16:31.700 --> 16:35.120
until the moment Chen lifts the wedding veil

16:35.204 --> 16:36.872
and our eyes meet.

16:36.955 --> 16:40.459
Then you will pass from this world

16:40.542 --> 16:42.961
to live with the ancestors.

16:44.963 --> 16:48.634
Perfect fit.
It brings out my eyes, don't you think?

16:49.718 --> 16:51.887
This will never work.

16:51.970 --> 16:54.389
I will tell the Swan Princess!

16:54.473 --> 16:56.934
Tell the whole world!

16:57.935 --> 17:01.063
No one will ever believe you.

17:01.146 --> 17:04.022
As for your beloved Swan Princess,

17:04.107 --> 17:06.568
I have plans for her too.

17:07.569 --> 17:12.781
You will never feel the love
that Chen and I have.

17:12.866 --> 17:15.117
You are evil,

17:15.202 --> 17:18.329
and our love is pure.

17:19.829 --> 17:22.415
You know what? You're kind of boring.

17:22.501 --> 17:24.920
And I have a wedding to plan.

17:32.511 --> 17:34.179
That landed bigtime!

17:34.263 --> 17:36.890
Mei Li was like, "What?"

17:36.974 --> 17:38.433
Well done, Fang!

17:38.517 --> 17:42.980
<i>...beating like a drum
To the victory</i>

17:44.189 --> 17:47.442
<i>Returning home a hero</i>

17:47.526 --> 17:49.152
Chen!

17:51.363 --> 17:54.491
I've never seen you
with flowers in your hair.

17:54.575 --> 17:56.618
It's beautiful.

17:56.702 --> 17:59.204
They bring out your eyes.

18:06.587 --> 18:09.756
My dream has come true.

18:17.181 --> 18:18.599
Mei Li!

18:18.682 --> 18:21.643
Oh, Father, thank you, thank you!

18:21.727 --> 18:26.356
- You're more beautiful than ever.
- You're so kind, Father.

18:29.026 --> 18:33.071
I can't believe we're going to have
our happily ever after!

18:34.114 --> 18:36.325
Thank you, Divine Emperor.

18:36.408 --> 18:40.746
I should be thanking you,
after all that's passed between us.

18:44.208 --> 18:47.878
<i>This mural tells the story of our ancestors.</i>

18:47.961 --> 18:50.464
<i>Their trials and their victories.</i>

18:50.547 --> 18:53.717
<i>Their sorrows and their joys.</i>

18:53.800 --> 18:57.679
Seven centuries are recorded here, princess.

18:57.763 --> 19:02.392
After the wedding, I hope
you will continue as the royal artist.

19:02.476 --> 19:05.521
I would be honored, Divine Emperor.

19:05.604 --> 19:09.191
May I restore
the oldest sections of the wall?

19:09.274 --> 19:10.901
You may.

19:10.984 --> 19:14.238
But please start with Mei Li.

19:14.321 --> 19:17.199
That spill haunts me.

19:17.282 --> 19:20.661
Now, where is Fang?
I summoned her a while ago.

19:20.744 --> 19:22.371
Father?

19:22.454 --> 19:23.997
If you don't mind,

19:24.081 --> 19:27.751
I'm feeling so tired
from all the excitement.

19:27.835 --> 19:29.169
Of course you are.

19:29.253 --> 19:32.297
May I excuse myself to lie down?

19:32.381 --> 19:33.423
Of course.

19:34.424 --> 19:38.220
May I introduce you
to my most ancient ancestors?

19:38.303 --> 19:40.848
We'd love to meet them.

19:43.016 --> 19:45.769
What a bunch of chumps!

19:45.853 --> 19:48.939
Not even the Swan Princess can tell
who I am!

19:49.022 --> 19:52.234
It's like taking candy from a baby.

19:52.317 --> 19:56.780
A really tiny baby
who's nodding off to sleep.

19:57.781 --> 20:00.492
Oh, yes.

20:01.493 --> 20:03.954
Han Fa was surrounded by his enemies...

20:04.037 --> 20:05.789
Emperor.

20:05.873 --> 20:10.294
Forgive my delay,
but I was studying the tea leaves and...

20:10.377 --> 20:13.338
- What is it, Fang?
- Bad news, I'm afraid.

20:14.339 --> 20:17.634
The mother of Prince Derek is gravely ill.

20:17.718 --> 20:19.553
But she was fine when we left.

20:19.636 --> 20:23.098
Oh, I've never known
Fang's tea leaves to be wrong.

20:23.182 --> 20:24.558
But you're certain, Fang?

20:25.559 --> 20:30.522
She lies so weak, saying, "I am ready to go.

20:30.606 --> 20:34.151
I have such wonderful memories."

20:34.234 --> 20:36.737
Derek shouting, "Arrange the marriage!"

20:36.820 --> 20:38.906
The day they brought home little...

20:38.989 --> 20:41.909
- Is it Alice?
- Alise.

20:41.992 --> 20:44.828
I am so sorry, Prince Derek.

20:44.912 --> 20:46.705
We have to return home.

20:46.788 --> 20:49.041
You will take my yacht. I insist.

20:49.124 --> 20:50.751
Thank you.

20:56.381 --> 20:58.884
Oh, I love this part.

20:58.967 --> 21:02.054
Queen Uberta giving a castle tour.

21:02.137 --> 21:03.764
Just darling.

21:03.847 --> 21:08.685
I'm definitely adding this
to my Book of the Month Club.

21:10.729 --> 21:13.857
Your belongings are all onboard now.

21:13.941 --> 21:15.108
Thank you, Ru.

21:15.192 --> 21:19.071
I will miss you both very much.

21:22.741 --> 21:24.618
Princess Odette!

21:24.701 --> 21:26.537
You know me?

21:26.620 --> 21:30.123
- Believe me!
- Believe you?

21:30.207 --> 21:32.125
My apologies, princess.

21:32.209 --> 21:35.963
- On your way. Move along now.
- No, please!

21:36.046 --> 21:38.841
Please, sir, be gentle.

21:38.924 --> 21:42.261
- She's old and weak.
- This is none of your concern.

21:46.473 --> 21:50.811
She said no one would believe me.

21:50.894 --> 21:54.648
Believe me, Odette.

22:18.964 --> 22:21.133
Still thinking about the old woman?

22:21.216 --> 22:23.177
"Believe me, Odette."

22:23.260 --> 22:25.762
She said it like she knew me.

22:25.846 --> 22:27.973
And what's strange is,

22:28.056 --> 22:31.185
I felt like I knew her too.

22:31.268 --> 22:33.604
It was strange, I agree.

22:33.687 --> 22:36.440
And that Fang, she's a little spooky.

22:36.523 --> 22:38.442
Found you!

22:38.525 --> 22:40.110
Oh, I scared you?

22:40.194 --> 22:43.030
I've been searching everywhere for you.
Turns out oceans are big.

22:43.113 --> 22:45.866
- Are we too late? Is Uberta...?
- Crazy? Yes.

22:45.949 --> 22:47.993
- Wait. What?
- She's driving me nuts!

22:48.076 --> 22:51.872
"Go find out what's happening
with Derek and Odette!"

22:51.955 --> 22:54.416
So she's not dying?

22:54.499 --> 22:57.794
Dying? Heavens, no!
I'm the one that's dying. She's killing me.

22:57.878 --> 23:00.214
That's saying something,
considering I'm already dead.

23:00.297 --> 23:03.091
Fang's tea leaves told us Uberta was dying.

23:03.175 --> 23:05.552
Go find out how she is. Now! Go!

23:05.636 --> 23:08.472
- I see it runs in the family.
- Scully...

23:16.647 --> 23:20.567
I've seen warm lemonade
with more kick than that.

23:20.651 --> 23:21.735
Nonsense.

23:27.491 --> 23:30.494
She's not only alive, she's dangerous.

23:30.577 --> 23:31.870
Fang lied.

23:31.954 --> 23:34.665
How did she know all those details?

23:34.748 --> 23:36.667
I mean, it's like she...

23:39.962 --> 23:43.841
She stole Uberta's book!
That's how she knew.

23:43.924 --> 23:46.844
Scully, go back and tell Rogers
and Mother we need help.

23:51.932 --> 23:54.852
- I broke a nail.
- Stop!

23:54.935 --> 23:58.063
Apologies, Highness,
but Derek says you gotta go now.

23:58.146 --> 24:00.065
That's all fine. That's fine.

24:00.148 --> 24:03.068
But are Mei Li and Chen getting married?

24:04.528 --> 24:05.904
Tell her that's the point.

24:05.988 --> 24:08.323
They won't get married
unless we get some help.

24:09.408 --> 24:11.535
Did the emperor blow up?

24:11.618 --> 24:15.330
The emperor is fine!
Are she and Rogers coming?

24:15.414 --> 24:17.749
What are their wedding colors?

24:17.833 --> 24:19.209
No idea!

24:19.293 --> 24:21.378
Did Derek even ask?

24:21.461 --> 24:24.089
- Scully!
- I need answers!

24:24.173 --> 24:27.259
Stop! You gotta go now.

24:27.342 --> 24:30.179
- Tell them we're on our way.
- Wait a second. One last thing.

24:30.262 --> 24:33.140
You can't go as Lord Rogers
and Queen Uberta.

24:33.223 --> 24:36.476
This Fang lady read your book.
She knows all about you.

24:36.560 --> 24:40.397
She knows about me?

24:41.398 --> 24:43.275
Then we have no other choice.

24:53.327 --> 24:55.871
Who are you supposed to be?

24:55.954 --> 24:58.749
What do you mean?
I'm your talent agent, Mr. Pennypacker.

24:58.832 --> 25:01.752
"Turning talent into gold, 24/7."

25:02.753 --> 25:03.962
Nice.

25:04.046 --> 25:08.592
Because I am Madame LeCroix,

25:08.675 --> 25:11.678
world-famous...

25:22.564 --> 25:24.608
Singer? No, Uberta.

25:24.691 --> 25:28.737
Pick something more suited
to your vocal talents, like...

25:28.820 --> 25:32.950
Like a world-renowned mime.

25:33.033 --> 25:38.038
Think of the facial expressions
you can use silently.

25:45.337 --> 25:49.967
Flight to Cathay,
now boarding at the royal pier.

25:52.678 --> 25:57.933
Seriously, Uberta, none of this roleplaying
is necessary until we get there.

25:58.016 --> 26:00.060
"Uberta"?

26:00.143 --> 26:03.814
Who is this Uberta you speak of?

26:08.360 --> 26:11.405
- Prepare for takeoff...
- Wait.

26:11.488 --> 26:17.411
There's no curtain between me and them?

26:21.498 --> 26:24.168
Prepare for blastoff!

26:24.251 --> 26:26.920
Isn't there any in-flight entertainment?

26:27.004 --> 26:28.797
Oh, very well.

26:28.881 --> 26:31.842
I'll provide the entertainment.

26:31.925 --> 26:34.803
Is it too late for me to jump?

26:37.431 --> 26:40.142
I should have known
Fang was up to something.

26:40.225 --> 26:42.477
I won't let her hurt Mei Li again.

26:42.561 --> 26:44.980
Let's go to your father
and tell him what Fang has done.

26:45.063 --> 26:47.524
No, we can't. Not yet.

26:48.525 --> 26:51.486
Come, I have to show you something.

26:54.615 --> 26:56.867
You're lucky Fang didn't see you.

26:56.950 --> 26:59.745
She wanders the halls like a ghost at night.

26:59.828 --> 27:03.165
Well, we didn't exactly take the halls.

27:04.958 --> 27:08.545
- It's been burning for years?
- Centuries.

27:08.629 --> 27:11.131
It's called the Sorcerer's Flame.

27:11.215 --> 27:12.925
It gives Fang her power.

27:13.008 --> 27:15.761
That's a lot of power for one person.

27:15.844 --> 27:20.307
Someone in the royal line can extinguish it,

27:20.390 --> 27:26.813
if the sorcerer were ever to use
his or her power for evil.

27:27.856 --> 27:30.025
Not when I'm done with it.

27:30.108 --> 27:32.945
Surely Fang is up to something evil.

27:33.028 --> 27:36.156
It is not that simple, princess.

27:36.240 --> 27:38.700
We need absolute proof.

27:38.784 --> 27:42.162
Father will not be the first ever
to extinguish the flame

27:42.246 --> 27:45.040
just because we think
Fang is up to something.

27:48.919 --> 27:51.505
Oh, come on, Fang! Pay attention!

27:51.588 --> 27:53.632
Be the stones.

27:55.008 --> 27:57.511
I have a plan. Come.

28:13.068 --> 28:17.030
Let's see them figure out this combination.

28:25.539 --> 28:28.500
Who made this mess in my kitchen?

28:28.584 --> 28:31.170
Did you do this, Woof-Shi?

28:38.051 --> 28:39.595
What?

28:42.306 --> 28:44.183
Oh, no, no! Out you go!

28:44.266 --> 28:46.768
I am preparing the emperor's breakfast.

28:46.852 --> 28:50.272
- I must concentrate.
- Not so fast.

28:50.355 --> 28:52.357
I asked them to deliver, Gong Fa.

28:53.692 --> 28:56.612
They grow the best bok choy.

28:56.695 --> 28:57.696
You see?

28:58.697 --> 29:02.034
I wouldn't feed that to Woof-Shi!

29:02.117 --> 29:04.077
These are royal fingers.

29:04.161 --> 29:07.539
I'll pick my own vegetables,
thank you very much.

29:08.582 --> 29:10.834
Now, part two.

29:14.379 --> 29:16.465
Did you get it?

29:18.383 --> 29:20.761
The key to Fang's lair.

29:20.844 --> 29:23.180
You're so brave, Mei Li.

29:23.263 --> 29:26.141
We have to work together to stop Fang.

29:26.225 --> 29:28.602
I'll wait here and keep a lookout for her.

29:28.685 --> 29:31.813
Please. Please be careful.

29:31.897 --> 29:33.649
Let's go.

29:40.280 --> 29:42.574
If Fang's up to something,

29:42.658 --> 29:45.577
the answer is down there.

29:54.253 --> 29:57.381
Chicka-chicka, Fang-Fang! Who's on fire?

29:58.382 --> 29:59.842
Fang on fire!

30:01.134 --> 30:02.845
I'll stay here.

30:02.928 --> 30:07.683
If Fang gets past Mei Li,
I'll buy you time. Good luck.

30:23.532 --> 30:24.700
Odette.

30:25.701 --> 30:26.994
"You..."

30:27.077 --> 30:29.621
"Should not..."

30:29.705 --> 30:31.957
"You should not have come back"?

30:36.587 --> 30:38.088
Derek!

30:38.172 --> 30:40.048
Get away, Odette! No!

30:44.970 --> 30:48.891
- Li! Oh, no. Li!
- No!

30:51.226 --> 30:52.811
Odette!

31:01.195 --> 31:02.362
Oh, thank you.

31:02.446 --> 31:04.114
- Are you all right? Quickly!
- Yes.

31:05.157 --> 31:07.534
Before Fang comes.

31:11.788 --> 31:15.292
- She knows we're back.
- I told you, she knows everything.

31:15.375 --> 31:19.254
There must be another way
to prove she's up to something.

31:19.338 --> 31:20.756
I don't think there is.

31:20.839 --> 31:24.885
It's the lair or nothing.
But you're not safe here. You must go.

31:27.471 --> 31:29.389
Reinforcements.

31:30.390 --> 31:34.394
Look, I don't know what the plan will be,
just be ready.

31:36.980 --> 31:43.362
Hey, look, you can buy a statue
of Bigfoot for your garden.

31:44.363 --> 31:46.073
It's full size, even.

31:46.156 --> 31:48.742
Ladies and gentlemen, tray tables up,

31:48.825 --> 31:51.912
seat backs in the full upright positions.

31:51.995 --> 31:55.123
Prepare for landing.

31:55.207 --> 31:59.711
Oh, that was a horrible flight.
And only peanuts the whole way.

32:04.675 --> 32:08.053
Hello, everyone.

32:08.136 --> 32:10.597
I have arrived.

32:10.681 --> 32:13.267
Your idol is here.

32:13.350 --> 32:15.394
Your star is here.

32:15.477 --> 32:17.521
Gather round, good people, gather round!

32:17.604 --> 32:19.690
I'm C.J. Pennypacker, ladies and gentlemen,

32:19.773 --> 32:24.862
and I'm sure you recognize
the one, the only, the silent...

32:24.945 --> 32:26.697
Madame LeCroix!

32:26.780 --> 32:31.368
World-famous ventriloquist!

32:32.661 --> 32:35.163
He means...

32:35.247 --> 32:38.750
world-famous vocalist.

32:38.834 --> 32:42.337
But mostly ventriloquist.

32:42.421 --> 32:44.506
I won't be a ventriloquist.

32:44.590 --> 32:49.136
When they ask you to perform,
you simply say, "I left my dummy at home."

32:49.219 --> 32:51.889
If only that were true.

32:51.972 --> 32:54.349
Your autograph, Madame LeCroix, please!

32:54.433 --> 32:59.605
- Your autograph.
- Why, yes, of course!

32:59.688 --> 33:02.774
- Derek and Odette!
- Nice costumes.

33:02.858 --> 33:05.777
Do you like it? It's so me.

33:05.861 --> 33:08.864
We need to talk. Right away. In private.

33:08.947 --> 33:11.283
Oh, so you want a balloon ride.

33:11.366 --> 33:14.494
Hot-diggity-dog, let's do this!

33:15.495 --> 33:20.626
That's when Jean-Bob, Speed
and Puffin will sneak into the lair.

33:20.709 --> 33:21.960
Okay, from the top.

33:22.044 --> 33:27.633
We use my fame
as an international singing star

33:27.716 --> 33:31.053
to get us into the royal palace.

33:31.136 --> 33:33.013
Right. And then?

33:33.096 --> 33:36.350
Then I'll find Fang and keep her distracted.

33:36.433 --> 33:39.978
- While?
- While we sneak into her lair

33:40.062 --> 33:42.481
and find the proof we're looking for.

33:42.564 --> 33:45.400
- Perfect.
- Point of clarification.

33:45.484 --> 33:48.278
We got a queen, a genius and two heroes,

33:48.362 --> 33:52.574
but the bird, the turtle and the frog
are doing all the dangerous stuff?

33:52.658 --> 33:55.369
Sometimes life's a lazy stroll
through the park

33:55.452 --> 33:58.914
and sometimes it's a scary run
through the jungle, Jean-Bob.

33:58.997 --> 34:01.834
Super comforting. Thanks.

34:01.917 --> 34:05.587
- Questions? Suggestions?
- Not from me.

34:05.671 --> 34:10.007
I think it's perfect!

34:10.092 --> 34:13.594
Allow me to suggest
a little plot twist, Uberta.

34:13.679 --> 34:19.016
A mad doctor has removed
LeCroix's vocal chords.

34:21.436 --> 34:26.608
Look, bub, I've been waiting
to play this role all my life,

34:26.692 --> 34:29.695
and nothing is going to ruin

34:29.777 --> 34:35.284
Madame LeCroix's world tour.

34:56.221 --> 35:00.392
Chen, Princess Odette
and Prince Derek have returned.

35:00.475 --> 35:02.519
Derek and Odette are back?

35:03.562 --> 35:05.606
Fang can't know.

35:05.689 --> 35:08.150
They came back because...

35:08.233 --> 35:12.654
Because they think she's determined
to stop our wedding.

35:12.738 --> 35:15.991
- This ends now.
- No, Chen.

35:16.074 --> 35:17.826
She is too powerful.

35:17.910 --> 35:21.288
Besides, I have a much better idea.

35:21.371 --> 35:23.957
Let's marry as soon as possible.

35:24.041 --> 35:26.752
Before Fang has time to ruin anything.

35:26.835 --> 35:29.004
But your father...

35:29.087 --> 35:31.757
I will beg until he agrees.

35:33.008 --> 35:34.510
Then the sooner, the better.

35:41.183 --> 35:43.769
I look so real.

35:44.770 --> 35:48.357
I've done my best to make it feel alive.

35:50.317 --> 35:53.237
I know it's not what you pictured, Father.

35:53.320 --> 35:58.158
You wanted pageantry
and a thousand guests, didn't you?

35:58.242 --> 36:00.410
Only because you deserve it.

36:00.494 --> 36:02.496
You're so kind, Father.

36:02.579 --> 36:04.164
It's just...

36:04.248 --> 36:07.376
I have nightmares that Fang...

36:07.459 --> 36:10.128
That she'll ruin everything.

36:10.212 --> 36:12.840
That she'll use her power to...

36:12.923 --> 36:15.259
No, I would never allow that.

36:18.387 --> 36:21.598
Recall the wedding invitations?

36:21.682 --> 36:24.017
It's a monumental task, I know.

36:24.101 --> 36:29.106
The invitations have gone out
by a dozen ships and a hundred horsemen.

36:30.440 --> 36:34.069
I'm sorry, Ru, but I owe this to Mei Li.

36:34.152 --> 36:36.321
This and much more.

36:36.405 --> 36:40.450
You are a good father, Divine Emperor.

36:40.534 --> 36:42.494
I wish.

36:42.578 --> 36:45.873
But let's hope there's enough time
to become one.

36:45.956 --> 36:47.791
Checkmate.

36:53.380 --> 36:56.466
I'm sorry, ma'am, I've never seen her.

37:00.512 --> 37:02.222
I'm looking for an old woman.

37:02.306 --> 37:04.933
She shouts, "Believe me."

37:05.017 --> 37:06.643
Sorry.

37:07.644 --> 37:08.979
Excuse me, sir?

37:13.734 --> 37:15.485
It's okay.

37:15.569 --> 37:17.571
Please, let me help you.

37:17.654 --> 37:19.364
Come with me.

37:21.658 --> 37:23.285
Excuse me.

37:23.368 --> 37:25.996
I saw you helping an old woman at the dock.

37:26.079 --> 37:27.956
I remember you!

37:28.040 --> 37:31.460
You were boarding
the royal yacht that night.

37:31.543 --> 37:34.838
Yes! Oh, she called you Odette?

37:36.840 --> 37:39.384
Please, keep my secret.

37:39.468 --> 37:42.471
- You can trust me.
- Thank you.

37:42.554 --> 37:45.682
Have you seen her, the old woman?

37:45.766 --> 37:48.852
Oh, I looked for her, but no.

37:48.936 --> 37:52.648
- Well, if you do...
- Oh, I'll tell her you're looking for her.

37:52.731 --> 37:55.108
- Oh, thank you.
- Of course.

37:58.612 --> 38:01.865
My good sir, please tell the emperor
we've arrived.

38:01.949 --> 38:05.786
I'm sorry, you can't just show up
to see the emperor.

38:05.869 --> 38:09.498
Excuse me, big guy.
I don't think you quite understand.

38:09.581 --> 38:12.960
Madame LeCroix's a huge star.

38:14.920 --> 38:17.881
I'm sure she is. Nevertheless...

38:17.965 --> 38:20.801
I will prove it.

38:21.844 --> 38:26.974
No. No free performances, remember?
Contract. Contract.

38:28.016 --> 38:32.855
Fine. Pay me something.
Anything, I don't care. A button!

38:34.982 --> 38:36.316
Madame LeCroix?

38:36.400 --> 38:41.154
I can't believe
I'm actually meeting you in person.

38:41.238 --> 38:44.241
Come, I have to introduce you to my father.

38:45.242 --> 38:48.871
It's okay, captain.
I'll take responsibility for them.

38:48.954 --> 38:53.584
You are not invited to my performance.

38:54.585 --> 38:59.423
On the other side of the world,
everyone knows about Madame LeCroix.

38:59.506 --> 39:01.800
We would be honored to hear you sing.

39:01.884 --> 39:06.346
- Why, yes, I'd...
- But I, Pennypacker, as her agent, think...

39:06.430 --> 39:11.560
- But I, LeCroix, think...
- It'll take her hours to warm up.

39:11.643 --> 39:13.854
Oh, I'm warm already.

39:13.937 --> 39:18.358
But why do you have to sing
when you have so many talents?

39:18.442 --> 39:21.195
Do that thing where you pretend
to be a statue for a long time.

39:21.278 --> 39:24.698
For a long time! Watch this.

39:28.035 --> 39:30.537
Knocks your socks off, right?

39:30.621 --> 39:33.832
Hello, beautiful.

39:33.916 --> 39:37.336
- This is Fang, my sorceress.
- A sorceress?

39:37.419 --> 39:40.464
Believe me,
I know the "it" factor when I see it,

39:40.547 --> 39:42.966
and you've got it!

39:44.051 --> 39:47.971
Come on, do your thing. Show me some magic.
A card trick. Anything.

39:48.055 --> 39:51.308
- How about I make you disappear?
- Fang!

39:51.391 --> 39:54.228
No, no, I like it!

39:54.311 --> 39:58.315
Behind that feline beauty,
she's got some real...

39:59.358 --> 40:04.071
I'm gonna make you
the world's greatest magician.

40:04.154 --> 40:07.241
- Send this clown away.
- Do you command me?

40:08.659 --> 40:12.538
Mr. Pennypacker,
if you are interested in Fang's abilities,

40:12.621 --> 40:16.750
she will take you
to see the Sorcerer's Flame.

40:17.793 --> 40:22.422
Hot-diggity-dog! This'll give us time
to talk about our world tour.

40:24.800 --> 40:28.095
Perhaps you'd like to see
some of our own statues.

40:34.184 --> 40:35.394
All clear.

40:35.477 --> 40:40.190
How come they make a little door
inside a big door, anyhow?

40:40.274 --> 40:42.568
Jean-Bob, get in there!

40:50.325 --> 40:52.744
Doggy door!

40:58.500 --> 41:00.294
I see, I see.

41:00.377 --> 41:04.256
Now, how come you call that thing
the Sorcerer's Flame?

41:04.339 --> 41:08.510
Because it is the source of my power.

41:17.603 --> 41:20.063
Come on, Speed. Let's go.

41:20.147 --> 41:21.440
Turtle soup.

41:21.523 --> 41:23.859
Nothing better.

41:27.196 --> 41:30.032
Woof-Shi, you missed one.

41:34.494 --> 41:37.956
Spicy puffin wings, the emperor's favorite!

41:38.040 --> 41:40.584
Well, Speed, it looks like we're dinner.

41:42.920 --> 41:46.423
Now, that's what we call a money shot.

41:46.507 --> 41:49.051
Glad you're impressed. Tour's over.

41:49.134 --> 41:52.638
What? Come on, baby, you call that sorcery?

41:52.721 --> 41:57.142
I thought you'd at least be able to do
the three classic magic tricks.

41:57.226 --> 41:59.770
Number one, pull a rabbit out of your hat.

42:02.314 --> 42:05.150
Number two, make somebody float.

42:09.905 --> 42:14.076
Number three, divide somebody in two.

42:14.159 --> 42:15.994
No! No, no, no.

42:16.078 --> 42:18.664
Put Mr. Pennypacker down.

42:36.014 --> 42:37.599
Security breach!

42:39.643 --> 42:40.686
Quick.

42:40.769 --> 42:44.648
Wait, wait, wait.
We've still gotta talk about your contract!

43:28.066 --> 43:31.528
Listen, I'll tell you what,
I will give you 50 percent

43:31.612 --> 43:34.072
of the international box office.

43:34.156 --> 43:39.703
I will give you 80 percent
of international and domestic.

43:39.786 --> 43:41.955
That's the emperor's...

43:49.713 --> 43:51.507
Listen to me, Fang. Listen, hey.

43:51.590 --> 43:54.801
I will give you everything.

43:54.885 --> 43:56.595
I'll take nothing!

43:56.678 --> 43:59.181
What do you say?
We got a deal, or we got a deal?

43:59.264 --> 44:01.016
Can't you see it?!

44:01.099 --> 44:03.894
I'm offering you the entire enchilada here.

44:03.977 --> 44:07.231
This is a super rare, once-in-a-lifetime...

44:07.314 --> 44:09.358
Oh, no. Where's Fang?

44:09.441 --> 44:11.652
Oh, she ran off that way.

44:11.735 --> 44:13.445
What?

44:15.155 --> 44:17.908
Well, it looks like
you got us here, Jean-Bob.

44:18.909 --> 44:20.202
Always the squeak.

44:20.285 --> 44:22.788
How come the bad guys never oil the hin...?

44:24.331 --> 44:27.292
Wait. He might be playing possum.

44:27.376 --> 44:31.046
I think only possums play possum.

44:31.129 --> 44:35.634
What if he's got a possum friend
who taught him all his possum tricks?

44:35.717 --> 44:38.720
A spider with a possum friend?

44:38.804 --> 44:40.597
We got a puffin friend.

44:40.681 --> 44:43.559
Well, enough chitchat. Now spread out.

44:43.642 --> 44:47.980
Sure. As long as I get to steer clear
of Mr. Spider over there.

44:59.199 --> 45:02.202
Nothing here but spells.

45:02.286 --> 45:04.913
Nothing here but jars full of...

45:04.997 --> 45:07.249
frog legs!

45:10.502 --> 45:11.753
Hey.

45:34.193 --> 45:36.445
Looks like we found it.

45:38.655 --> 45:40.866
These are not good enough.

45:40.949 --> 45:43.702
Look at this. No. What is this?

45:43.785 --> 45:46.288
Who picked these? No.

45:48.874 --> 45:51.793
I'll pick my own vegetables,
thank you very much.

45:52.794 --> 45:54.671
Try this one.

46:02.137 --> 46:04.223
Do you recognize me?

46:05.974 --> 46:09.561
It's me, Princess Mei Li.

46:09.645 --> 46:12.898
You used to let me cook in the kitchen.

46:14.024 --> 46:15.609
Can't you see?

46:15.692 --> 46:17.945
I'm Mei Li!

46:18.028 --> 46:21.657
Yes, yes, you're Mei Li.

46:23.283 --> 46:25.827
Poor dear.

46:30.582 --> 46:32.751
I'll be back tomorrow.

46:39.341 --> 46:40.759
Let's try down here.

46:44.513 --> 46:47.182
We found it in Fang's lair.

46:52.563 --> 46:55.524
Fang loves Chen?

46:55.607 --> 46:58.735
- Well, this is our proof!
- We've gotta get this to Li.

46:58.819 --> 47:02.197
Puffin, tell Li to meet us
at the Moon Bridge.

47:03.740 --> 47:05.200
I'm Mei Li.

47:07.286 --> 47:08.745
Puffin!

47:08.829 --> 47:10.163
Hey!

47:11.164 --> 47:12.958
Hey!

47:16.461 --> 47:20.007
I call these two my grand ancestors,

47:20.090 --> 47:23.302
famous for their bravery and wisdom

47:23.385 --> 47:28.348
but mostly for their goodness
as royal parents.

47:28.432 --> 47:30.642
I wish I had their gift.

47:32.311 --> 47:37.816
I'll bet sometimes
they felt unfit as parents too.

47:39.401 --> 47:44.198
But I've found that our children tend
to remember the best in us

47:44.281 --> 47:47.910
and let the rest fade away.

47:47.993 --> 47:50.245
Do you really think so?

47:50.329 --> 47:53.957
Oh, I know so.

47:54.041 --> 47:56.585
Believe me.

48:06.720 --> 48:07.846
What?

48:07.930 --> 48:12.309
The good news is, we've got time between now
and the wedding to stop Fang.

48:12.392 --> 48:15.437
The bad news is,
Father has moved up the wedding.

48:15.521 --> 48:16.522
What?

48:16.605 --> 48:19.608
Mei Li wants to get married right away.

48:19.691 --> 48:22.694
Your father has to extinguish
the Sorcerer's Flame.

48:22.778 --> 48:24.780
Who knows what Fang has planned?

48:24.863 --> 48:28.742
When he sees this, Father will not hesitate.

48:28.825 --> 48:30.035
Odette!

48:30.118 --> 48:34.373
There's an old woman calling your name
in the marketplace.

48:34.456 --> 48:35.457
Let's go.

48:36.458 --> 48:40.128
While I find Father,
keep watch for Fang, okay?

48:40.212 --> 48:41.630
Well, of course.

48:42.798 --> 48:45.217
Why does she have to be called "Fang"?

48:45.300 --> 48:47.553
Why not just "Tooth"?

48:48.679 --> 48:52.808
I was shopping in the market,
and this old woman came up to me,

48:52.891 --> 48:55.477
and she said she was Mei Li.

48:55.561 --> 48:59.022
She was so sincere, I almost believed her.

48:59.106 --> 49:02.901
But, of course,
she couldn't actually be Mei Li.

49:03.944 --> 49:06.572
The emperor would want her
well looked after.

49:07.614 --> 49:10.576
I will go and see if I can find her.

49:17.207 --> 49:20.210
Mei Li and Chen will be married down there,

49:20.294 --> 49:23.589
not too far from the Moon Bridge, you see?

49:24.756 --> 49:25.966
Yes.

49:26.049 --> 49:28.677
Such a lovely spot.

49:28.760 --> 49:30.762
I'd like you to be there.

49:30.846 --> 49:34.224
In fact, I'd like you to sing.

49:37.144 --> 49:38.520
Yes!

49:38.604 --> 49:42.024
Take that, Pennypacker.

49:43.775 --> 49:45.485
Odette.

49:45.569 --> 49:47.321
Odette.

49:47.404 --> 49:50.616
I am Mei Li.

49:50.699 --> 49:51.783
Did you say...?

49:51.867 --> 49:53.327
Yes!

49:53.410 --> 49:55.787
I am...

50:03.378 --> 50:05.964
Oh, poor dear.

50:06.048 --> 50:07.716
How can I help?

50:11.136 --> 50:12.971
Allow me, princess.

50:13.972 --> 50:17.351
Is this the woman who insists she's you?

50:17.434 --> 50:19.603
So you've heard of her too.

50:19.686 --> 50:21.813
My heart breaks for her.

50:21.897 --> 50:24.816
Please, take her to the royal cottage, Ru,

50:24.900 --> 50:27.569
and see that she's looked after.

50:34.493 --> 50:37.788
I'm so glad you're both safe.

50:43.168 --> 50:45.212
That was sure strange.

50:45.295 --> 50:47.464
You're telling me.

50:49.758 --> 50:52.344
Thank you, miss.

50:57.349 --> 50:59.184
That's her.

51:02.980 --> 51:05.941
Oh, Fang, you are so good!

51:08.610 --> 51:11.530
They have no idea who the old woman is. Zip!

51:12.573 --> 51:16.702
- The old woman is Mei Li.
- Come on.

51:19.955 --> 51:22.958
Oh, come on, Fang! What's the rule?

51:23.041 --> 51:27.171
Look both ways before changing.
It's a simple rule.

51:48.734 --> 51:52.988
I can't blame you for wanting to be Mei Li.

51:53.071 --> 51:56.909
She's the most wonderful person
I've ever known.

51:56.992 --> 51:58.785
I was her tutor.

51:58.869 --> 52:01.496
Like a second father to her.

52:01.580 --> 52:04.917
At least, that's how she made me feel.

52:05.000 --> 52:09.755
She and Chen were under a spell, you know.

52:09.838 --> 52:11.882
I can tell you.

52:11.965 --> 52:16.386
I was there when the spell was broken.

52:16.470 --> 52:18.555
She was so brave.

52:19.556 --> 52:21.600
So brave.

52:26.438 --> 52:31.860
So if someone tells me you're mad
for believing you're Mei Li,

52:31.944 --> 52:38.367
I will tell them, "No, that woman is
the most sane among us

52:38.450 --> 52:43.413
because everyone should wish to be Mei Li."

53:05.727 --> 53:08.188
Excuse me? Sir.

53:09.273 --> 53:14.069
The woman you brought here,
may I help take care of her?

53:14.152 --> 53:15.487
You know her?

53:15.571 --> 53:17.698
We met just once.

53:17.781 --> 53:20.784
She seemed so sad.

53:20.868 --> 53:24.580
I'm sure she could use a friend.

53:27.124 --> 53:31.420
The cook will give you everything
you need to care for her.

53:31.503 --> 53:34.840
Oh, thank you, kind sir.

53:53.275 --> 53:55.402
I told you, you shouldn't have come back.

53:55.485 --> 53:57.863
We know what you've done.

53:57.946 --> 54:01.074
Oh, dear, they know what I've done!

54:01.158 --> 54:02.618
And we know why.

54:02.701 --> 54:04.411
Chen belongs to Mei Li.

54:04.494 --> 54:07.080
I am...

54:08.081 --> 54:10.751
sweet, innocent Mei Li.

54:13.504 --> 54:15.881
You will not get Chen!

54:15.964 --> 54:17.883
Too late.

54:29.228 --> 54:30.979
What is this place?

54:31.063 --> 54:33.065
This can't be good.

54:37.069 --> 54:38.570
- Ru! Help us!
- Ru!

54:38.654 --> 54:39.821
- Ru, stop!
- Can you hear...?

54:42.449 --> 54:43.825
- Please, help us!
- Help!

54:43.909 --> 54:45.869
- Help us, Ru!
- Help!

54:45.953 --> 54:47.955
He can't hear us.

54:48.038 --> 54:50.499
What is this place?

54:59.591 --> 55:01.927
Poor daring heroes.

55:02.010 --> 55:04.513
So used to coming to the rescue.

55:04.596 --> 55:08.392
But the moment Chen lifts my veil
and our eyes meet,

55:08.475 --> 55:14.273
we will be married and Mei Li will die.

55:16.316 --> 55:18.360
Now, that's a 10, Fang!

55:18.443 --> 55:20.779
A 10 all the way!

55:20.863 --> 55:23.615
Chicka-chicka, Fang-Fang!

55:27.661 --> 55:29.663
Father!

55:30.664 --> 55:32.291
Father!

55:35.294 --> 55:40.257
I shall prepare a very special number.

55:40.340 --> 55:43.135
I know you will, Madame LeCroix.

55:47.848 --> 55:51.185
- Father, there you are.
- What is it, son?

55:52.561 --> 55:54.062
What?

55:54.146 --> 55:55.147
No!

56:06.533 --> 56:08.368
Derek.

56:12.497 --> 56:14.666
Revered ancestors,

56:14.750 --> 56:17.127
a horrible decision stands before me.

56:17.211 --> 56:21.131
I need the wisdom only you can provide.

56:30.432 --> 56:32.976
You seem troubled, Father.

56:33.060 --> 56:34.645
Can I help?

56:34.728 --> 56:37.814
You are so much like your sweet mother.

56:39.566 --> 56:42.694
I don't need the ancestors
to tell me what to do.

56:42.778 --> 56:45.906
No sorcerer is more important to me
than you are.

56:45.989 --> 56:50.244
I won't allow Fang
to destroy your happiness.

56:58.502 --> 57:00.420
The Flame!

57:02.464 --> 57:04.174
Oh, she's so cruel.

57:41.295 --> 57:42.921
No!

57:43.005 --> 57:46.216
- Please don't.
- You lied to me!

57:46.300 --> 57:50.762
To think how you made my daughter suffer
for your own selfish desires!

57:50.846 --> 57:53.223
How you made this whole kingdom suffer!

57:53.307 --> 57:56.560
I have done wrong, Divine Emperor.

57:56.643 --> 57:59.271
But for the sake of the ancestors...

57:59.354 --> 58:03.108
- Speak not of the ancestors!
- But I must.

58:03.192 --> 58:06.945
For all the ancestors who have passed

58:07.029 --> 58:09.281
and all who will come,

58:09.364 --> 58:12.868
you must not extinguish the Flame.

58:12.951 --> 58:16.121
You leave me no choice!

58:17.164 --> 58:19.875
There is a choice.

58:19.958 --> 58:23.629
I will go away, never to return.

58:23.712 --> 58:25.964
That will be my punishment.

58:26.048 --> 58:29.718
You will never see me again, I promise.

58:36.099 --> 58:38.060
If you do return,

58:38.143 --> 58:41.730
you will forfeit your life.

58:42.731 --> 58:45.651
Your judgment is just,

58:45.734 --> 58:48.487
Divine Emperor.

59:14.638 --> 59:18.016
I never could have
planned this better myself.

59:18.100 --> 59:19.893
Fang is no more.

59:19.977 --> 59:22.646
Never to be seen again.

59:22.729 --> 59:26.984
I will now and forever be...

59:27.985 --> 59:31.530
Mei Li.

59:32.990 --> 59:37.494
Careful, girl, that's a Fang laugh.

59:39.746 --> 59:41.832
Much better.

59:49.840 --> 59:51.341
Yes?

59:52.342 --> 59:55.512
I just passed Fang.
She was running from the castle.

59:55.596 --> 59:58.098
She said she was never to return.

59:58.182 --> 01:00:00.809
I don't know what you did, Father,

01:00:00.893 --> 01:00:03.187
but thank you, thank you!

01:00:04.271 --> 01:00:07.107
Now you can marry without fear.

01:00:07.191 --> 01:00:08.358
Oh, Li!

01:00:08.442 --> 01:00:12.362
I am so, so happy for you, Mei Li.

01:00:12.446 --> 01:00:13.864
Almost ready.

01:00:13.947 --> 01:00:18.577
You know, your soup is the only thing
I can get her to eat.

01:00:18.660 --> 01:00:21.830
I am so pleased. The poor thing.

01:00:21.914 --> 01:00:24.583
You are so kind to take care of her.

01:00:24.666 --> 01:00:27.294
Come back as often as you must.

01:00:30.380 --> 01:00:32.132
- I'm sorry.
- Oh, no.

01:00:32.216 --> 01:00:35.427
No, I am sorry, royal prince.

01:00:36.720 --> 01:00:38.972
Just "Li" will do.

01:00:40.390 --> 01:00:41.642
Li.

01:00:49.775 --> 01:00:51.860
Where's Ru? He asked me to meet him here.

01:00:53.153 --> 01:00:56.698
- I haven't seen him.
- Really?

01:01:03.539 --> 01:01:05.749
Matchmaker.

01:01:05.832 --> 01:01:09.378
I have no idea what you're talking about.

01:01:23.475 --> 01:01:26.812
Mei Li has always been my favorite.

01:01:26.895 --> 01:01:28.480
Yes.

01:01:28.564 --> 01:01:33.193
I'm sad for anyone
who doesn't get to see this moment.

01:01:34.945 --> 01:01:36.738
Excuse me.

01:01:42.953 --> 01:01:46.999
Your mother was so looking forward
to this day.

01:01:48.333 --> 01:01:51.086
You are such a beautiful bride.

01:02:13.150 --> 01:02:15.944
The wedding song is sacred,

01:02:16.028 --> 01:02:20.574
for it speaks of a love
that is honest and true.

01:02:26.872 --> 01:02:29.416
Please, Father, must we have this song?

01:02:29.499 --> 01:02:31.335
Oh, you'll love it.

01:02:31.418 --> 01:02:34.087
I'm sure it will be beautiful.

01:02:41.929 --> 01:02:48.936
<i>Your love comes to rescue me
Just in time</i>

01:02:49.019 --> 01:02:54.358
<i>Giving all, you reach me
Just in time</i>

01:02:54.441 --> 01:03:00.280
<i>Everything
All I could do or love or sing</i>

01:03:00.364 --> 01:03:03.534
<i>Now makes a new forever dream</i>

01:03:03.617 --> 01:03:10.624
<i>For us</i>

01:03:10.707 --> 01:03:14.753
<i>My heart will always beat</i>

01:03:14.837 --> 01:03:18.715
<i>The sun will always shine</i>

01:03:18.799 --> 01:03:21.593
<i>You'll always save me</i>

01:03:21.677 --> 01:03:28.684
<i>Just in time</i>

01:03:31.186 --> 01:03:36.275
<i>Like the moon just after dawn</i>

01:03:37.276 --> 01:03:42.656
<i>I still see it so clear</i>

01:03:43.657 --> 01:03:48.745
<i>Your beauty lives on</i>

01:03:48.829 --> 01:03:51.748
<i>And I am here</i>

01:04:42.382 --> 01:04:45.844
<i>I am here, Mei Li</i>

01:04:45.928 --> 01:04:47.638
<i>I'm here</i>

01:04:48.639 --> 01:04:54.353
<i>And if now it's time to go</i>

01:04:55.354 --> 01:04:58.857
<i>I am always</i>

01:04:58.941 --> 01:05:04.530
<i>Forever with you</i>

01:05:08.200 --> 01:05:13.622
<i>Forever here</i>

01:05:13.705 --> 01:05:17.167
<i>With you</i>

01:05:38.021 --> 01:05:44.403
<i>You are here just in time</i>

01:05:44.486 --> 01:05:49.616
- <i>Always here just in time</i>
- Mother?

01:05:51.243 --> 01:05:54.621
Your eyes will see one last beautiful thing.

01:06:04.590 --> 01:06:10.220
<i>You are here just in time</i>

01:06:10.304 --> 01:06:15.976
<i>Each and every moment
Brings new love</i>

01:06:16.059 --> 01:06:20.022
<i>Forever and always</i>

01:06:20.105 --> 01:06:27.112
<i>You save me</i>

01:06:30.574 --> 01:06:37.581
<i>In time</i>

01:06:53.055 --> 01:06:54.306
Oh, no.

01:06:55.307 --> 01:06:57.935
I'm doing the lip thing.

01:07:04.107 --> 01:07:05.901
Princess Mei Li.

01:07:05.984 --> 01:07:07.110
Chen.

01:07:07.194 --> 01:07:09.112
You may kneel.

01:07:10.989 --> 01:07:15.035
Chen, you may now lift the veil.

01:07:19.122 --> 01:07:20.207
Stop!

01:07:20.290 --> 01:07:22.960
Don't lift her veil. It's Fang!

01:07:23.043 --> 01:07:26.547
No, you're mistaken, princess.
Fang is banished.

01:07:26.630 --> 01:07:29.424
How can you do something so horrible?

01:07:29.508 --> 01:07:32.219
Father, don't let them ruin everything.

01:07:32.302 --> 01:07:35.055
- Please send them away.
- Explain yourselves!

01:07:35.138 --> 01:07:39.268
Fang used her powers
to change herself into Mei Li.

01:07:39.351 --> 01:07:40.519
Wait a second!

01:07:40.602 --> 01:07:44.565
Are you telling me I sang for an imposter?

01:07:46.316 --> 01:07:49.778
What is this treachery?
Deceit and disguises.

01:07:49.862 --> 01:07:51.989
Take them all away.

01:07:52.072 --> 01:07:55.576
Please, give us a chance to prove it.

01:07:55.659 --> 01:07:57.744
Because if Chen lifts that veil,

01:07:57.828 --> 01:08:00.080
Mei Li will die.

01:08:00.163 --> 01:08:03.041
Are you saying I don't know my own daughter?

01:08:03.125 --> 01:08:04.501
Dear Emperor, please!

01:08:09.339 --> 01:08:11.508
This is Mei Li.

01:08:11.592 --> 01:08:15.262
This is your beautiful daughter.

01:08:15.345 --> 01:08:18.015
Forgive me, Divine Emperor,

01:08:18.098 --> 01:08:21.560
but I believe
the Swan Princess may be right.

01:08:24.645 --> 01:08:27.816
Please, Father, don't believe them.

01:08:29.568 --> 01:08:32.237
Wait. I know what's happening.

01:08:32.321 --> 01:08:34.865
The old woman is Fang.

01:08:34.948 --> 01:08:37.492
She's trying to turn my friends against me.

01:08:37.576 --> 01:08:41.787
Please, I cannot bear it. Please!

01:08:41.872 --> 01:08:45.792
Ru, give her to the guards.

01:08:50.756 --> 01:08:52.508
I'm so sorry.

01:08:52.591 --> 01:08:55.344
I believe you.

01:09:04.810 --> 01:09:06.479
Father.

01:09:07.481 --> 01:09:09.191
Mei Li?

01:09:11.609 --> 01:09:15.197
I knew you'd believe me.
Thank you, princess.

01:09:19.701 --> 01:09:21.036
You?

01:09:22.037 --> 01:09:24.872
Yes. I did it for us, Chen.

01:09:24.957 --> 01:09:27.709
Surely you understand.

01:09:27.792 --> 01:09:30.254
I did it for us, darling.

01:09:30.337 --> 01:09:34.049
What are you talking about?
There is no "us."

01:09:36.885 --> 01:09:41.098
I'm so sorry. So sorry I couldn't tell.

01:09:41.180 --> 01:09:44.393
Well, now that you all know my secret...

01:09:44.475 --> 01:09:47.979
- Seize her!
- Careful. Sharp objects.

01:09:48.063 --> 01:09:49.564
I command you to stop!

01:09:51.608 --> 01:09:54.695
You are commanding me?

01:09:54.778 --> 01:09:58.407
- I can't breathe. I can't breathe.
- I knew I should've taken away your power.

01:09:58.490 --> 01:10:02.244
Yup. That's gonna cost you. Bye-bye.

01:10:03.495 --> 01:10:06.665
The choice to do evil is yours alone.

01:10:07.875 --> 01:10:11.336
That would make a great motivational poster.

01:10:11.420 --> 01:10:13.005
I can see that.

01:10:13.088 --> 01:10:17.342
On the other hand,
I've got plenty of motivation.

01:10:17.426 --> 01:10:21.263
<i>And one and two
And away he flew!</i>

01:10:22.264 --> 01:10:23.265
Derek!

01:10:25.434 --> 01:10:29.563
This is what I get for nailing the song?

01:10:29.646 --> 01:10:32.941
What...? What is this place?!

01:10:33.025 --> 01:10:36.236
Hello? Chen, are you there?

01:10:36.320 --> 01:10:38.614
I don't want you to miss the ending.

01:10:45.996 --> 01:10:47.247
What?

01:10:48.248 --> 01:10:53.295
Northwest, southwest, south, northeast.

01:10:55.380 --> 01:10:56.757
I know that's right.

01:10:57.758 --> 01:10:59.176
Fang.

01:11:02.763 --> 01:11:06.850
Oh, Ru, don't you ever get tired
of meddling?

01:11:09.937 --> 01:11:12.981
Watch this.

01:11:13.065 --> 01:11:16.026
So that's what all the Fang talk was about.

01:11:17.444 --> 01:11:21.698
Oh, you want to play snake and mouse!

01:11:21.782 --> 01:11:24.993
Derek, we have to do something.

01:11:31.208 --> 01:11:32.835
Dear emperor?

01:11:33.836 --> 01:11:38.757
Ancestors, save my children
and these good people.

01:11:38.841 --> 01:11:40.676
And the frog.

01:11:43.804 --> 01:11:45.931
What else can I do?

01:11:46.014 --> 01:11:49.351
Where there are pure hearts and good works,

01:11:49.434 --> 01:11:51.937
there is always hope.

01:11:56.567 --> 01:11:58.694
Oh, thank you.

01:12:09.663 --> 01:12:10.664
No!

01:12:11.999 --> 01:12:14.334
Such great fun!

01:12:14.418 --> 01:12:18.213
Round and round the garden,
like a slimy snake.

01:12:18.297 --> 01:12:20.424
One smash!

01:12:20.507 --> 01:12:21.842
Two smash!

01:12:21.925 --> 01:12:25.053
Time for a princess bake.

01:12:26.096 --> 01:12:29.266
Fangs and fire? Seriously?

01:12:30.517 --> 01:12:32.436
This is all my fault!

01:12:48.243 --> 01:12:49.828
I'll distract her.

01:12:49.912 --> 01:12:51.288
Get ready to run.

01:12:51.371 --> 01:12:54.958
No, princess. I can't let you do this.

01:13:00.088 --> 01:13:01.089
Oh, thank you.

01:13:05.344 --> 01:13:06.595
I've got an idea.

01:13:08.722 --> 01:13:11.975
Where are you, my little mouse?

01:13:12.059 --> 01:13:13.435
Fang.

01:13:13.519 --> 01:13:15.896
Perfect! A twofer.

01:13:15.979 --> 01:13:18.524
I'm the one you really want.

01:13:18.607 --> 01:13:22.110
- Mei Li.
- Go ahead, do your evil.

01:13:22.194 --> 01:13:25.364
When I say "now," pull.

01:13:27.950 --> 01:13:28.867
No, Odette!

01:13:30.285 --> 01:13:31.119
Now!

01:13:44.383 --> 01:13:47.803
- Were we in time?
- I don't know. Come on.

01:13:50.514 --> 01:13:53.308
They're all... gone!

01:13:53.392 --> 01:13:55.310
Oh, no.

01:13:56.353 --> 01:13:58.730
- Master Li?
- Ru!

01:14:11.285 --> 01:14:13.871
Oh, Odette.

01:14:14.872 --> 01:14:16.164
She saved me.

01:14:20.669 --> 01:14:22.171
Odette...

01:14:37.227 --> 01:14:38.353
Odette.

01:14:54.286 --> 01:14:58.248
All hail the Swan Princess.

01:14:58.332 --> 01:15:00.083
Yes.

01:15:00.167 --> 01:15:02.544
Hail to the Swan Princess.

01:15:27.736 --> 01:15:32.741
It takes more than fangs and fire
to defeat true love.

01:15:33.742 --> 01:15:36.828
Sounds like a line someone else would say.

01:15:51.593 --> 01:15:54.513
Remember, dignity.

01:15:58.725 --> 01:16:03.230
We will never forget
what you have done for this kingdom.

01:16:05.148 --> 01:16:08.777
As my father has spoken.

01:16:11.488 --> 01:16:14.116
As my father...

01:16:17.119 --> 01:16:20.789
You're the best friend I've ever had.

01:16:22.249 --> 01:16:25.169
I will miss you, my friend.

01:16:51.695 --> 01:16:54.198
Times have certainly changed, Ru.

01:16:54.281 --> 01:16:56.450
My daughter has married a common artist,

01:16:56.533 --> 01:17:00.287
and here I am, eating in the kitchen.

01:17:00.370 --> 01:17:03.290
Indeed they have, Divine Emperor.

01:17:03.373 --> 01:17:06.793
But I think I've taken all the change I can.

01:17:06.877 --> 01:17:10.172
From now on, Ru, we go back to the old ways.

01:17:11.215 --> 01:17:12.799
Really?

01:17:13.800 --> 01:17:16.470
That is so funny.

01:17:19.598 --> 01:17:23.727
Father! You're in the kitchen?

01:17:27.189 --> 01:17:28.774
Let's go.

01:17:31.818 --> 01:17:34.071
Did you know about this, Ru?

01:17:34.154 --> 01:17:39.159
The times are certainly changing,
Divine Emperor.

01:17:59.208 --> 01:18:04.208
