00:00.834 --> 00:02.368
<i>Previously on</i>
<i>"The Practice"...</i>

00:02.402 --> 00:04.771
-I'm pregnant.
-Who's the father?

00:04.805 --> 00:06.740
Actually, I'm keeping
that confidential.

00:06.773 --> 00:08.474
He's basically
just a sperm donor,

00:08.509 --> 00:10.777
and I'm going to be
a single mom.

00:13.647 --> 00:15.348
That's my rape signal pager.

00:15.381 --> 00:18.118
My name's Lucy Hatcher.

00:18.151 --> 00:19.553
I'm a counselor
from the rape crisis center.

00:24.691 --> 00:28.328
When I saw what happened
to her, I freaked.

00:28.361 --> 00:30.163
This was your very first call.
I think--

00:30.196 --> 00:31.698
I'm just not cut out
for it, Rebecca.

00:31.732 --> 00:35.135
Without your help.

00:35.168 --> 00:36.537
Thank you.

00:36.570 --> 00:37.771
Sure.

00:37.804 --> 00:39.673
Get out.

00:39.706 --> 00:40.774
-What?
-Go!

00:43.544 --> 00:45.345
That's my daughter.

00:45.378 --> 00:47.447
Uh, she suffered some
pretty tough internal injuries.

00:47.480 --> 00:49.583
There's also some swelling
in the brain.

00:49.616 --> 00:51.417
Now, she's still unconscious
and probably will stay that way

00:51.451 --> 00:54.287
until, uh, well,
the swelling goes down.

00:54.320 --> 00:55.589
Hey, Beck.

00:55.622 --> 00:57.624
You're a godmother now.

00:57.658 --> 01:00.527
We just need for you
to wake up.

01:15.676 --> 01:18.144
Hey.

01:18.178 --> 01:20.547
Oh, my.

01:20.581 --> 01:22.148
He already looks bigger.

01:22.182 --> 01:23.750
Yeah, he eats like a hog.

01:23.784 --> 01:25.652
Oh, he's a gorgeous thing.

01:25.686 --> 01:27.588
Yeah, he is.

01:30.724 --> 01:32.859
Hey, Beck.

01:32.893 --> 01:37.831
They let me in here
with little Bobby.

01:37.864 --> 01:41.502
Her neurological responses
are improving.

01:41.535 --> 01:44.771
The doctor said the swelling
is almost completely down.

01:45.872 --> 01:49.510
Come on, Beck.

01:49.543 --> 01:52.478
Three days.

01:52.513 --> 01:54.447
Enough is enough.

01:58.384 --> 02:02.589
That is so beautiful,
Michael.

02:02.623 --> 02:04.825
It's amazing--
When are you publishing?

02:04.858 --> 02:07.327
I'm hoping in June.

02:07.360 --> 02:09.495
Is this one here,
is this going to be the cover?

02:09.530 --> 02:12.332
Either that one
or this here,

02:12.365 --> 02:13.834
this-- this little girl.

02:13.867 --> 02:16.870
-Look at her face.
-Yeah.

02:16.903 --> 02:21.742
Okay, you want to see something
really incredible, Michael?

02:21.775 --> 02:23.844
Okay.

02:23.877 --> 02:26.312
This is what I call

02:26.346 --> 02:28.782
an amazing picture.

02:28.815 --> 02:32.485
Look, that's--
That's her head,

02:32.519 --> 02:34.621
and her hands.

02:37.658 --> 02:39.225
Wow.

02:39.259 --> 02:40.794
Yeah.

02:40.827 --> 02:42.495
You helped make that.

02:42.529 --> 02:44.364
Can you believe it?

02:47.534 --> 02:49.703
Yeah.

02:49.736 --> 02:52.372
That's, um...

02:55.809 --> 02:58.779
That's what I came
to talk to you about, Ellenor.

02:58.812 --> 03:00.547
I'm not sure

03:00.581 --> 03:03.650
that I can stick
to the deal.

03:03.684 --> 03:07.621
What do you mean?

03:07.654 --> 03:09.890
I want to help parent
this baby.

03:09.923 --> 03:11.692
I know the agreement,

03:11.725 --> 03:13.960
but when you asked me
to be the father--

03:13.994 --> 03:15.996
No, I asked you
to be the donor.

03:16.029 --> 03:18.464
And I thought that I could--

03:18.498 --> 03:20.567
Then never mind the agreement.
It's a contract.

03:20.601 --> 03:22.603
A signed one, Michael.

03:24.838 --> 03:26.807
My...

03:26.840 --> 03:29.743
lawyer thinks that I can
probably get around that.

03:32.012 --> 03:33.580
You've been to a lawyer?

03:33.614 --> 03:36.482
It's one thing to--

03:36.517 --> 03:39.686
I thought that--

03:39.720 --> 03:41.622
But to have a baby--

03:41.655 --> 03:43.423
You don't have a baby, Michael.

03:43.456 --> 03:45.258
I have a baby.

03:45.291 --> 03:48.394
You provided sperm.

03:48.428 --> 03:51.565
I don't want her to grow up
without a father.

03:55.636 --> 03:56.703
â™ª (theme)

04:48.622 --> 04:51.592
-He changed his mind?
-Yes, and we have a contract,

04:51.625 --> 04:53.860
and he says he's going to try
to get around it.

04:53.894 --> 04:56.462
He's already been
to see a lawyer.

04:56.496 --> 04:57.731
Okay, try to calm down
a little.

04:57.764 --> 04:58.899
Who is this guy?

04:58.932 --> 05:00.701
His name is Michael Hale.

05:00.734 --> 05:01.968
He is a very successful
photographer,

05:02.002 --> 05:04.104
and he is an old friend.

05:04.137 --> 05:06.973
Friend like friends,
or--

05:07.007 --> 05:08.909
It wasn't a romantic
relationship, Lucy.

05:08.942 --> 05:12.613
His involvement here
is purely genetic.

05:12.646 --> 05:13.880
And you have
a signed agreement?

05:13.914 --> 05:15.616
Yes, fully executed,

05:15.649 --> 05:17.651
terminating all
of his rights as a father,

05:17.684 --> 05:19.886
and now he wants to go
to court and get it voided.

05:19.920 --> 05:21.888
When's the hearing?

05:21.922 --> 05:23.657
I'm not sure.

05:23.690 --> 05:25.659
I mean, I threw him out.
I'm not--

05:25.692 --> 05:26.893
I don't know.

05:26.927 --> 05:28.895
Okay.

05:28.929 --> 05:30.897
I'll see if I can get
his lawyer to come here

05:30.931 --> 05:32.899
before he goes into court.

05:32.933 --> 05:35.736
Once we get
a judge involved--

05:35.769 --> 05:37.904
It's complicated,
Ellenor.

05:37.938 --> 05:40.907
I can't--

05:40.941 --> 05:42.909
I can't believe
he's doing this.

05:42.943 --> 05:46.046
We have a deal.

05:56.790 --> 05:57.958
Amanda McGowan, please.

05:57.991 --> 05:59.593
You are...?

05:59.626 --> 06:01.595
I'm Lucy Hatcher,
rape crisis.

06:01.628 --> 06:04.798
Second door on the right.
The doctor's in with her.

06:08.835 --> 06:11.104
Try to get
a little rest.

06:11.137 --> 06:12.939
I'm going to go talk
to your dad.

06:12.973 --> 06:15.976
I'm sorry.
Who are you?

06:16.009 --> 06:18.945
Lucy Hatcher,
rape crisis.

06:18.979 --> 06:20.814
Oh, I already did
the rape kit.

06:20.847 --> 06:22.415
I need to speak to the father,
then I'll be back.

06:22.448 --> 06:24.551
Okay.

06:24.585 --> 06:25.886
Amanda,
I'm Lucy Hatcher,

06:25.919 --> 06:28.822
a counselor
from the rape crisis--

06:35.662 --> 06:37.163
How old are you?

06:37.197 --> 06:39.099
Eleven.

06:44.571 --> 06:46.507
She's been gone
for over three hours.

06:46.540 --> 06:48.675
They're usually
back here in an hour.

06:48.709 --> 06:49.910
Well, let me check.

06:51.978 --> 06:54.114
Excuse me.

06:54.147 --> 06:56.817
Could you check on the status
of patient Rebecca Washington?

06:56.850 --> 06:58.619
She went down
to radiology

06:58.652 --> 07:00.053
for a CAT scan
several hours ago.

07:00.086 --> 07:02.956
-Several hours ago?
-Yes.

07:02.989 --> 07:04.691
Hold on.

07:04.725 --> 07:08.962
Yes, ICU patient
Washington, Rebecca

07:08.995 --> 07:13.867
went for a PET scan
and a CAT scan at 7:30.

07:13.900 --> 07:15.969
She did?

07:16.002 --> 07:17.137
At what time?

07:17.170 --> 07:18.905
She's not in her room?

07:18.939 --> 07:21.808
-No, she isn't.
-No, she isn't.

07:21.842 --> 07:23.176
Would you check
with patient escorts, please?

07:23.209 --> 07:24.911
Thank you.

07:24.945 --> 07:26.913
She should be
up here shortly.

07:26.947 --> 07:29.550
Well, when did
she leave radiology?

07:29.583 --> 07:31.885
Well, I'm not sure,
but I'm sure she'll
be back here shortly.

07:31.918 --> 07:33.153
(telephone rings)

07:33.186 --> 07:34.621
Hold on.

07:34.655 --> 07:36.590
ICU.

07:36.623 --> 07:37.958
Um...

07:37.991 --> 07:40.627
No, she isn't.

07:40.661 --> 07:42.495
Mm-hmm.

07:42.529 --> 07:43.864
Okay.

07:43.897 --> 07:45.866
What's going on?

07:45.899 --> 07:47.701
I'm going to page
the doctor.

07:47.734 --> 07:49.069
Yes, before you
do that, nurse,

07:49.102 --> 07:50.537
I want to know
where Ms. Washington is.

07:50.571 --> 07:51.905
I don't know.

07:51.938 --> 07:54.040
Well, who does know?

07:54.074 --> 07:55.075
I don't know.

07:55.108 --> 07:56.610
Is she lost?

07:56.643 --> 07:58.845
At the moment,
that's a possibility.

08:01.815 --> 08:04.751
You keep talking to me
in terms of contract, but--

08:04.785 --> 08:06.520
Because that's
what we have, Michael.

08:06.553 --> 08:08.522
-You and I--
-I understand,

08:08.555 --> 08:10.657
and I fully intended
to go through with it, but--

08:10.691 --> 08:11.925
So, what's changed?

08:11.958 --> 08:14.528
What's changed is
circumstances.

08:14.561 --> 08:16.897
How? Tell me.

08:16.930 --> 08:19.065
Before, I was thinking
in terms of genetics,

08:19.099 --> 08:21.568
in terms of sperm
fertilizing an egg.

08:21.602 --> 08:24.571
But when it becomes
a person--

08:24.605 --> 08:28.008
The idea was for it
to become a person, Michael.

08:28.041 --> 08:30.577
Yes, but--
I had no conception

08:30.611 --> 08:32.546
of how that would
affect me.

08:32.578 --> 08:34.748
It will be my child.

08:34.780 --> 08:37.082
No, it won't.
She will be my child.

08:37.116 --> 08:38.952
And whatever
any contract may say--

08:38.985 --> 08:40.687
All right, all right,
look, none of us wants

08:40.721 --> 08:42.288
to turn this
into a big mess.

08:42.322 --> 08:44.558
Well, that's exactly
what your client is doing.

08:44.591 --> 08:46.760
Ellenor.

08:46.793 --> 08:48.695
You were saying?

08:48.729 --> 08:50.897
We're looking for paternity,
then joint custody when--

08:50.931 --> 08:52.933
-Absolutely not.
-Ellenor, you'd be primary.

08:52.966 --> 08:54.735
I will not raise my child
in a split environment,

08:54.768 --> 08:55.936
having her pulled
between two--

08:55.969 --> 08:57.804
Look, I'm here right now

08:57.838 --> 09:00.006
trying to avoid going to court.
If you're--

09:00.040 --> 09:01.575
Then go to court, Michael,

09:01.608 --> 09:02.943
because there is
no way in hell

09:02.976 --> 09:06.647
I am going to give you
joint custody.

09:11.952 --> 09:13.887
Do you want us to take
a minute outside, while--

09:13.920 --> 09:17.791
My position will not change
in a minute.

09:19.993 --> 09:24.865
Then I guess we see you next
with a judge.

09:26.900 --> 09:30.336
I'm not looking
for a battle, Ellenor.

09:30.370 --> 09:33.640
Well, you've got one, Michael.

09:33.674 --> 09:35.609
Come on.

09:47.420 --> 09:49.389
We may not win,
Ellenor.

09:49.422 --> 09:52.392
The law on this
in Massachusetts is untested.

09:52.425 --> 09:54.861
Then we're
about to test it.

09:54.895 --> 09:56.329
Listen,

09:56.362 --> 09:58.999
I'm not necessarily saying
make a deal,

09:59.032 --> 10:01.668
but if you agree
to some limited custody--

10:01.702 --> 10:03.203
I won't.

10:03.236 --> 10:06.106
My fear is if a judge
opens this thing up,

10:06.139 --> 10:08.642
there's a risk
of full joint custody.

10:08.675 --> 10:10.043
How? We have a contract.

10:10.076 --> 10:12.378
I understand,

10:12.412 --> 10:15.616
but what if that contract
doesn't hold up?

10:27.728 --> 10:29.329
Are you suggesting, Ms. Garrett,

10:29.362 --> 10:31.231
this was not a valid contract?

10:31.264 --> 10:34.167
I'm suggesting that there was
no meeting of the minds.

10:34.200 --> 10:35.869
It's the equivalent
of a mistake.

10:35.902 --> 10:37.403
A mistake?

10:37.437 --> 10:40.406
Yes, Mr. Hale had no idea
what he was giving up.

10:40.440 --> 10:42.876
Now, wait a second.

10:42.909 --> 10:45.411
Your Honor, this contract
violates public policy.

10:45.445 --> 10:49.015
There is no question
that if my client wanted

10:49.049 --> 10:51.217
to surrender a child
for adoption,

10:51.251 --> 10:53.219
he couldn't do that legally

10:53.253 --> 10:56.156
until four days
after the child was born.

10:56.189 --> 10:58.859
And why is that?

10:58.892 --> 11:00.694
Because the law
doesn't want parents

11:00.727 --> 11:02.062
signing away their rights

11:02.095 --> 11:04.130
before they know
what's really at stake.

11:04.164 --> 11:06.800
Mr. Hale always knew exactly
what was at stake when--

11:06.833 --> 11:08.869
How can you
make that claim?

11:08.902 --> 11:11.872
Because he executed
a contract.

11:11.905 --> 11:14.074
Yes, and perhaps
there should be a presumption

11:14.107 --> 11:17.711
in favor of that agreement,
but it can't be irrebuttable,

11:17.744 --> 11:21.347
not when you're talking
about a child,

11:21.381 --> 11:24.985
and there will be a child
that this very much affects,

11:25.018 --> 11:27.721
and that's what's dawning
on my client here.

11:27.754 --> 11:31.157
His daughter will come to him
one day, like it or not,

11:31.191 --> 11:34.027
and she may ask why she didn't
get to have a father.

11:34.060 --> 11:36.897
What is he supposed
to do then--

11:36.930 --> 11:38.799
Hold up a contract?

11:41.067 --> 11:42.435
All right.

11:42.468 --> 11:44.437
I want to hear
from the parties on this.

11:44.470 --> 11:47.007
BERLUTI: Why?

11:47.040 --> 11:49.943
Because if Mr. Hale is claiming
no meeting of the minds,

11:49.976 --> 11:51.411
I want to explore

11:51.444 --> 11:55.015
exactly what they thought
they were agreeing to.

11:55.048 --> 11:57.417
2:00.

12:04.090 --> 12:06.126
Jimmy,

12:06.159 --> 12:07.761
please don't take this
the wrong way

12:07.794 --> 12:09.029
because I know you're here
to support me,

12:09.062 --> 12:11.497
and I really appreciate it,

12:11.532 --> 12:13.399
but that was a horrible
performance in there.

12:13.433 --> 12:17.070
If a contract is clear
on its face, which this one is,

12:17.103 --> 12:18.404
you do not go behind it

12:18.438 --> 12:20.807
to explore the intent
of the parties.

12:20.841 --> 12:23.043
There was nothing ambiguous
in the language,

12:23.076 --> 12:25.478
and you should have been
screaming that. Instead--

12:25.512 --> 12:27.147
Ellenor, this isn't
an ordinary contract.

12:27.180 --> 12:30.450
Yes, it is.
Yes, it is.

12:30.483 --> 12:32.953
If you believe that,
you're not thinking clearly.

12:32.986 --> 12:35.021
Now, listen to me.

12:35.055 --> 12:38.458
That judge was not about to rule
on the face of the language,

12:38.491 --> 12:40.226
not when it involves
a child.

12:40.260 --> 12:42.462
He's taking into account
best interests.

12:42.495 --> 12:44.965
You know it
as well as I do.

12:46.900 --> 12:48.368
Fine.

12:48.401 --> 12:51.505
Then I want to go
after Michael as unfit.

12:51.538 --> 12:53.574
With what?

12:53.607 --> 12:55.809
I'll tell you what.

13:00.514 --> 13:02.516
We are looking into it,
I assure you.

13:02.549 --> 13:03.950
You're looking into it?

13:03.984 --> 13:05.886
How do you
lose a patient?

13:05.919 --> 13:07.954
It's possible that
she could have been brought

13:07.988 --> 13:09.956
to another patient's room who
also has the name Washington,

13:09.990 --> 13:11.224
and we're
checking that out now.

13:11.257 --> 13:13.594
What are
the other possibilities?

13:13.627 --> 13:15.562
Well, she could have
regained consciousness.

13:15.596 --> 13:16.930
She could be roaming
around the building.

13:16.963 --> 13:18.398
Would she
be strong enough?

13:18.431 --> 13:20.567
Well, she'd be weak,
but she had no injuries

13:20.601 --> 13:24.037
that would prevent her
from being ambulatory.

13:24.070 --> 13:25.506
Hello.

13:25.539 --> 13:27.073
I'm Natalie Clarkson
from patient relations.

13:27.107 --> 13:28.875
There's a problem?

13:28.909 --> 13:31.477
Yes, there's a problem.
You've lost my daughter.

13:31.512 --> 13:34.114
Okay, and she was
last seen where?

13:34.147 --> 13:36.950
-She was last seen unconscious.
-Helaine--

13:36.983 --> 13:38.585
They've lost Rebecca,
Bobby.

13:38.619 --> 13:40.821
And now they send someone
from customer service?

13:42.488 --> 13:45.926
You have lost my daughter,
who is in a coma.

13:45.959 --> 13:48.461
What are you two
whispering about?

13:48.494 --> 13:50.396
There is
another Washington,

13:50.430 --> 13:53.466
a Regina Washington,
who is currently--

13:53.499 --> 13:55.268
What room is she in?

13:55.301 --> 13:57.037
Well, she's listed as being
in surgery right now.

13:57.070 --> 14:00.073
Um, she's having
her kidney removed.

14:07.013 --> 14:08.348
Hey, Luce.

14:08.381 --> 14:10.016
Helen.

14:11.618 --> 14:13.486
Hi, Amanda.
How you doing?

14:13.520 --> 14:15.421
I'm okay.

14:15.455 --> 14:17.057
Amanda, this is Helen Gamble.

14:17.090 --> 14:19.025
She's a district attorney.

14:19.059 --> 14:20.994
She's going to get the guy
who did this to you.

14:21.027 --> 14:23.329
I heard you talked
a little bit to the police.

14:23.363 --> 14:25.298
Can I speak to you, too?

14:25.331 --> 14:27.534
Your dad said it would be okay
if I asked you some questions.

14:27.568 --> 14:31.071
We can trust her.
She's here to help.

14:31.104 --> 14:34.007
The good news is
we caught him.

14:34.040 --> 14:36.510
At least I'm pretty sure of it.

14:36.543 --> 14:40.981
What I was wondering is...

14:41.014 --> 14:42.616
I was wondering
whether you'd be able

14:42.649 --> 14:45.552
to look at what we call
a police lineup.

14:45.586 --> 14:47.387
What's that?

14:47.420 --> 14:50.657
Well, you look at five men
standing side by side,

14:50.691 --> 14:53.293
and you point to the man
who did it,

14:53.326 --> 14:54.928
if you see him.

14:54.961 --> 14:56.362
-No.
-Well, Amanda--

14:56.396 --> 14:58.464
No, I don't want
to see him.

14:58.498 --> 15:01.067
Let me talk to Ms. Gamble
one second.

15:07.608 --> 15:09.610
Does she have to?

15:09.643 --> 15:11.411
The rape kit
turned up nothing--

15:11.444 --> 15:13.313
No semen, no DNA.

15:13.346 --> 15:16.650
This whole case comes down
to eyewitness testimony.

15:16.683 --> 15:18.652
So it'll be her word
against his?

15:18.685 --> 15:20.654
No. We have
another eyewitness.

15:20.687 --> 15:22.656
A woman saw it from a balcony.

15:22.689 --> 15:24.958
Well, can't you just
arrest on that?

15:24.991 --> 15:27.393
Yes, but the truth is
if Amanda I. D. s him now

15:27.427 --> 15:29.495
in a lineup,
our case gets better,

15:29.530 --> 15:31.965
and she's more likely
to I. D. him at trial.

15:31.998 --> 15:35.135
I don't think she's
strong enough emotionally

15:35.168 --> 15:37.403
to see him.
I really don't.

15:37.437 --> 15:40.073
I'll push it
through arraignment.

15:40.106 --> 15:41.608
We'll see how it goes.

15:41.642 --> 15:44.010
Thank you.

15:46.747 --> 15:50.216
There just wasn't any room
in my life for a family.

15:50.250 --> 15:52.118
As a photojournalist,

15:52.152 --> 15:55.055
I'm always leaving
for Bosnia or Vietnam,

15:55.088 --> 15:57.123
you name it.

15:57.157 --> 15:59.560
I never even considered
having a child.

15:59.593 --> 16:01.762
Until Ms. Frutt
asked for your help.

16:01.795 --> 16:03.564
I knew
she wanted a baby.

16:03.597 --> 16:05.465
When she approached me
to be the donor,

16:05.498 --> 16:08.635
it just felt right,

16:08.669 --> 16:10.671
and I knew how great
she'd be with a child.

16:10.704 --> 16:13.406
And I thought
if I could do that for her,

16:13.439 --> 16:15.776
give her that chance,

16:15.809 --> 16:18.579
how could that be wrong?

16:18.612 --> 16:20.747
-You signed an agreement--
-Yes.

16:20.781 --> 16:23.617
...relinquishing your rights
as a father to this child.

16:23.650 --> 16:25.719
All I can say is I made
a mistake.

16:25.752 --> 16:27.453
I wanted it to work.

16:27.487 --> 16:29.422
I signed the contract
thinking it would.

16:29.455 --> 16:33.393
But this isn't some
abstract gift I can give.

16:33.426 --> 16:36.429
It's a child...

16:36.462 --> 16:38.298
my child, who deserves
to grow up

16:38.331 --> 16:41.101
with the love of her father.

16:41.134 --> 16:42.803
When you negotiated
this agreement,

16:42.836 --> 16:44.270
did you have a lawyer?

16:44.304 --> 16:45.806
Yes.

16:45.839 --> 16:47.708
You intended to give up
your rights to this child.

16:47.741 --> 16:49.442
Yes, but as I said--

16:49.475 --> 16:51.712
And now you want the court
to disregard your intent.

16:51.745 --> 16:53.747
I'm asking
that my current intent

16:53.780 --> 16:57.283
be given more weight,
especially since it serves

16:57.317 --> 16:59.720
the best interests
of this child.

16:59.753 --> 17:01.287
Let's consider, then,

17:01.321 --> 17:03.289
the interests of your son,
Mr. Hale--

17:03.323 --> 17:04.758
The one who's seven years old.

17:04.790 --> 17:07.661
-Objection.
-Overruled. What son is this?

17:07.694 --> 17:09.395
Mr. Hale?

17:09.429 --> 17:11.196
Seven years ago,

17:11.231 --> 17:12.464
a girlfriend of yours
had a child.

17:12.498 --> 17:14.300
I was young.

17:14.334 --> 17:16.469
I wasn't ready
to act like a father.

17:16.502 --> 17:19.138
-But now you are.
-Yes, now I am.

17:19.172 --> 17:21.775
Are you being a father
to this seven-year-old boy?

17:21.808 --> 17:25.211
-No.
-Why not?

17:25.244 --> 17:27.580
You don't think he needs
the love of his father?

17:27.614 --> 17:29.616
-Objection.
-Overruled.

17:29.650 --> 17:33.186
Have you even met that son,
Mr. Hale?

17:33.219 --> 17:35.789
Look, I lost the chance
to know my son.

17:35.822 --> 17:38.625
I can't just walk up
to a seven-year-old kid

17:38.659 --> 17:40.426
and introduce myself.

17:40.460 --> 17:43.764
But here, I have a chance
to be there from the start.

17:43.797 --> 17:46.833
Ever tell my client
you could never be
responsible enough

17:46.867 --> 17:48.535
to raise a child?

17:48.569 --> 17:50.336
I once thought that,
but I--

17:50.370 --> 17:52.539
Oh, you changed your mind
on that, too.

17:52.573 --> 17:54.340
People mature,
Mr. Berluti.

17:54.374 --> 17:57.210
Is breaking a contract
a sign of maturity?

17:57.243 --> 17:59.379
Have you ever been
a father, sir?

17:59.412 --> 18:01.782
No, but you have,
seven years ago.

18:01.815 --> 18:03.884
You failed.
You're still failing.

18:03.917 --> 18:05.819
-Objection.
-Overruled.

18:05.852 --> 18:07.721
And now you put
this woman under stress

18:07.754 --> 18:09.523
while she's
eight months pregnant.

18:09.556 --> 18:11.525
That's not my intent.

18:11.558 --> 18:12.726
-You know your intent?
-Objection!

18:12.759 --> 18:14.661
Withdrawn.

18:14.695 --> 18:17.230
How many months a year
are you in town, Mr. Hale?

18:17.263 --> 18:20.834
I am willing to adjust
my lifestyle to be here more.

18:20.867 --> 18:22.869
-You have a girlfriend, sir?
-I do.

18:22.903 --> 18:25.806
-How old is she?
-What relevance does her age--

18:25.839 --> 18:27.808
The witness has suggested
that he's growing up.

18:27.841 --> 18:29.676
How old
is your girlfriend, sir?

18:29.710 --> 18:32.212
She's 20.

18:32.245 --> 18:35.181
-Ever been convicted
of anything?
-Objection.

18:35.215 --> 18:37.183
Whether he has a record,
I think,

18:37.217 --> 18:39.385
-speaks to his fitness
as a parent.
-I'll allow it.

18:39.419 --> 18:41.722
Ever been convicted
of anything, sir?

18:43.389 --> 18:44.758
Let's make it easy.

18:44.791 --> 18:47.227
Ever been convicted
in the last year?

18:47.260 --> 18:48.494
Yes.

18:48.529 --> 18:50.931
-Drugs?
-Possession of marijuana.

18:50.964 --> 18:53.333
-Are you a pothead, sir?
-No, I'm not.

18:53.366 --> 18:55.869
-But you smoke dope.
-I have used it recreationally

18:55.902 --> 18:57.704
very occasionally.

18:57.738 --> 18:59.305
But you've probably
changed your mind

18:59.339 --> 19:02.308
about that now, right?

19:07.447 --> 19:09.249
It wasn't her,

19:09.282 --> 19:13.386
so wherever she is,
she's still got both kidneys.

19:13.419 --> 19:15.421
Not a funny joke.

19:15.455 --> 19:17.824
May I ask a question?
Has this happened before?

19:17.858 --> 19:20.193
Not often,
but it has happened.

19:20.226 --> 19:22.529
We're searching radiology.

19:22.563 --> 19:24.931
After that, we're going through
every floor, every room.

19:24.965 --> 19:26.767
Who took her?

19:26.800 --> 19:28.802
Somebody had to wheel her
out of the CAT scan.

19:28.835 --> 19:31.471
Yes, the escort who was
to bring Rebecca back to the ICU

19:31.505 --> 19:33.273
finished work at noon.

19:33.306 --> 19:35.241
We haven't been able
to find him, either.

19:35.275 --> 19:38.311
He's not at home
and he doesn't have a cell.

19:38.344 --> 19:41.214
Look, obviously
I can't excuse this.

19:41.247 --> 19:42.849
All I can say...

19:42.883 --> 19:44.585
I know she's somewhere
in the building,

19:44.618 --> 19:45.886
and we'll find her.

19:49.623 --> 19:52.626
(babies crying)

20:12.546 --> 20:15.516
Is nothing beneath you?

20:15.549 --> 20:17.684
Sir, you're represented
by counsel. You--

20:17.718 --> 20:19.753
We have been,
maybe, best friends

20:19.786 --> 20:21.622
most of our
adult lives,

20:21.655 --> 20:26.259
and you attack me like that
for what-- Legal strategy?

20:26.292 --> 20:27.794
You think
that was legal strategy?

20:29.763 --> 20:33.667
I'm protecting my daughter.

20:45.345 --> 20:48.314
Well, your turn comes next.

21:10.103 --> 21:12.005
Case number 3216,

21:12.038 --> 21:14.440
Commonwealth v. Bruce Wilson,

21:14.474 --> 21:16.810
rape of a minor
under the age of 12.

21:16.843 --> 21:18.945
Joshua Pashman
for the defense, Your Honor.

21:18.979 --> 21:20.981
We waive reading.
We'd be seeking
personal recognizance.

21:21.014 --> 21:23.717
-Opposed.
-My client has strong roots
in this community.

21:23.750 --> 21:25.952
No job,
lives in a housing project.

21:25.986 --> 21:28.655
We consider him dangerous
as well as a flight risk.

21:28.689 --> 21:30.023
Bail is denied.

21:30.056 --> 21:31.357
Move for a probable cause.

21:31.391 --> 21:32.926
Tomorrow morning, 10:00.

21:32.959 --> 21:34.528
Your Honor, I haven't yet
spoke with our witness--

21:34.561 --> 21:36.396
Then why
are you filing charges?

21:38.064 --> 21:39.933
Confer with your witness

21:39.966 --> 21:41.668
and we'll see you
back here tomorrow.

21:41.702 --> 21:43.336
(gavel pounds)

21:48.609 --> 21:51.845
Ms. Gamble,
I'm Amanda's father.

21:51.878 --> 21:52.846
Oh.

21:52.879 --> 21:55.115
I'm very sorry.

21:55.148 --> 21:56.950
What's going to happen?

21:56.983 --> 21:59.019
Well, we have
a probable cause hearing,

21:59.052 --> 22:01.421
so I need to find
the woman who witnessed--

22:01.454 --> 22:02.623
She's right there.

22:09.462 --> 22:12.432
Michael and I have been
friends for a long time.

22:12.465 --> 22:14.868
I chose him as a donor
because I liked him,

22:14.901 --> 22:17.504
for genetic reasons,
and most of all,

22:17.538 --> 22:19.873
because I trusted him
on his word.

22:19.906 --> 22:22.475
But you don't want him
as a coparent?

22:22.509 --> 22:25.145
That's why we signed
this agreement.

22:25.178 --> 22:27.881
Could you tell me
your main objection?

22:27.914 --> 22:30.416
I don't believe
I need a man in my life

22:30.450 --> 22:32.786
to raise
a happy healthy daughter.

22:32.819 --> 22:35.155
There are a lot
of single mothers today

22:35.188 --> 22:38.024
who are doing
whatever it takes to fulfill

22:38.058 --> 22:40.426
their responsibilities
as a parent.

22:40.460 --> 22:42.028
Moreover,

22:42.062 --> 22:44.898
if I were sharing
those responsibilities

22:44.931 --> 22:46.900
with a man,

22:46.933 --> 22:48.635
I never would have
chosen Michael Hale.

22:48.669 --> 22:51.071
Why don't you want him
to participate?

22:51.104 --> 22:54.007
Because I'm not in love
with him,

22:54.040 --> 22:56.977
and he doesn't love me,
and now...

22:57.010 --> 22:58.478
I don't trust him.

22:58.512 --> 23:02.182
I got pregnant--
I changed my life--

23:02.215 --> 23:04.484
Based on promises he broke,

23:04.518 --> 23:07.988
and if we were forced together
as coparents,

23:08.021 --> 23:12.025
our entire relationship
would be grounded in betrayal,

23:12.058 --> 23:16.196
and that mistrust would
most definitely harm this child.

23:16.229 --> 23:18.565
But is it better
for the child

23:18.599 --> 23:20.634
to lose contact
with her father?

23:20.667 --> 23:22.068
In this case, yes.

23:22.102 --> 23:24.437
It would be better
for my daughter

23:24.470 --> 23:26.139
to have one loving parent

23:26.172 --> 23:28.441
than to be thrown
into a situation

23:28.474 --> 23:31.745
that is already filled
with tension and acrimony.

23:31.778 --> 23:35.916
Are you suggesting Mr. Hale
is unfit to be a father?

23:35.949 --> 23:37.884
How can I trust him to?

23:37.918 --> 23:39.185
Look at his history.

23:39.219 --> 23:42.055
Look at how he has
behaved here.

23:42.088 --> 23:45.191
This is as irresponsible
as it is arbitrary.

23:45.225 --> 23:48.729
I am eight months pregnant.
I'm in court.

23:48.762 --> 23:51.732
He has put me under stress,
put the baby under stress,

23:51.765 --> 23:56.469
all on his sudden whim
that he wants to be involved.

23:56.503 --> 23:59.005
Well, if you agreed
to let him parent,

23:59.039 --> 24:00.741
you wouldn't be in court.

24:00.774 --> 24:02.809
Your Honor,
he may be well-intentioned,

24:02.843 --> 24:05.211
but what's
his real motivation?

24:05.245 --> 24:08.649
Who's to say
this isn't about guilt

24:08.682 --> 24:09.950
over abandoning his son,

24:09.983 --> 24:12.485
about redemption,
about himself,

24:12.519 --> 24:17.490
rather than any real desire
to be a father?

24:17.524 --> 24:20.561
So you don't need a man
to help you raise a child.

24:20.594 --> 24:23.229
Are you currently
with a man, Ms. Frutt?

24:23.263 --> 24:25.131
No.

24:25.165 --> 24:26.967
If you were currently
involved with a man,

24:27.000 --> 24:28.101
would you still
be having a child

24:28.134 --> 24:29.536
as a single parent?

24:29.570 --> 24:31.137
I don't know,
Ms. Garrett.

24:31.171 --> 24:33.073
If I were sharing
my life with a man,

24:33.106 --> 24:35.842
I would likely expect him
to be a part of this decision,

24:35.876 --> 24:37.978
but I was not involved
with anybody

24:38.011 --> 24:40.246
at the time
that I made this contract.

24:40.280 --> 24:42.248
I was not involved
with your client,

24:42.282 --> 24:44.851
nor am I involved
with anybody now.

24:44.885 --> 24:47.854
I would never have chosen
to have a child with him.

24:47.888 --> 24:50.156
Ms. Frutt,
if you were convinced

24:50.190 --> 24:53.226
that Mr. Hale would, in fact,
be a model father,

24:53.259 --> 24:55.529
would you change
your position?

24:55.562 --> 24:58.231
No...

24:58.264 --> 25:00.867
because I'm not
in love with him,

25:00.901 --> 25:02.803
and I never--

25:02.836 --> 25:05.071
I understand,
but let's be fair.

25:05.105 --> 25:07.974
Then you are talking
about what you want,

25:08.008 --> 25:11.144
not necessarily
the best interests of the child.

25:11.177 --> 25:13.146
I don't accept that,
Your Honor,

25:13.179 --> 25:15.248
because I don't accept
your hypothetical

25:15.281 --> 25:17.818
that he could ever be
a model parent.

25:17.851 --> 25:21.087
You consider yourself
an authority on parenthood?

25:21.121 --> 25:23.757
I consider myself
an authority on my child.

25:23.790 --> 25:25.291
Are you aware
of studies,

25:25.325 --> 25:27.761
including one from
the U. S. justice department,

25:27.794 --> 25:29.996
that show children
from single-parent homes

25:30.030 --> 25:32.098
are more likely
to drop out of school,

25:32.132 --> 25:34.300
more likely
to commit crimes--

25:34.334 --> 25:36.036
Most of those studies

25:36.069 --> 25:37.738
are pertaining
to impoverished families.

25:37.771 --> 25:39.205
I have financial means.

25:39.239 --> 25:41.942
Yes, because you work.
Plan to continue working?

25:41.975 --> 25:43.644
Yes.

25:43.677 --> 25:46.179
When do you plan to go back
to work, Ms. Frutt?

25:46.212 --> 25:47.581
I'm not sure.

25:47.614 --> 25:49.282
Within three years?

25:49.315 --> 25:51.351
Yes.

25:51.384 --> 25:53.186
Are you aware
of the studies showing

25:53.219 --> 25:55.255
that the child's attachment
to the working mother

25:55.288 --> 25:57.157
can be significantly harmed--

25:57.190 --> 25:58.859
I'm aware of the studies
that reject that position.

25:58.892 --> 26:00.994
Some even say
a child can benefit

26:01.027 --> 26:03.196
from their experiences
at day care.

26:03.229 --> 26:05.832
Do you plan to put the child
in day care?

26:05.866 --> 26:07.901
I will not be cross-examined
on whether or not--

26:07.934 --> 26:10.937
Ms. Frutt, if you go back
to work full-time,

26:10.971 --> 26:13.840
you won't be the only
primary caregiver.

26:13.874 --> 26:15.108
Who will help you?

26:15.141 --> 26:16.710
I plan to hire.

26:16.743 --> 26:18.144
You haven't yet?

26:18.178 --> 26:21.247
No, because I haven't
needed to yet.

26:21.281 --> 26:23.249
So we don't know

26:23.283 --> 26:25.218
who this other
primary caregiver will be.

26:25.251 --> 26:27.120
You just don't want it
to be her father.

26:27.153 --> 26:30.256
He is not the father.
He is a sperm donor.

26:30.290 --> 26:32.258
Okay.
Are you aware

26:32.292 --> 26:34.227
of the U. S. Department
of Education report

26:34.260 --> 26:36.329
that says children
do better in schools

26:36.362 --> 26:38.398
when their fathers
are involved?

26:38.431 --> 26:40.333
Well, I would be
very surprised

26:40.366 --> 26:42.402
if that study embraced
nonresident fathers.

26:42.435 --> 26:44.638
Well, it did,
but my question was

26:44.671 --> 26:46.272
did you even
read the study?

26:46.306 --> 26:48.108
No.

26:48.141 --> 26:50.410
So what studies
on single parenting

26:50.443 --> 26:52.145
did you rely on

26:52.178 --> 26:54.648
before deciding
to become a single mother?

26:54.681 --> 26:57.050
Are you aware,
for example,

26:57.083 --> 26:58.752
that single-parent children

26:58.785 --> 27:00.821
are more likely
to be antisocial,

27:00.854 --> 27:02.255
more likely to suffer

27:02.288 --> 27:04.791
from anxiety, depression,
hyperactivity,

27:04.825 --> 27:07.227
are more likely to need
psychiatric care,

27:07.260 --> 27:09.863
are more likely to commit
suicide as a teenager,

27:09.896 --> 27:11.865
more likely
to drop out of school--

27:11.898 --> 27:13.199
More likely than who--

27:13.233 --> 27:15.936
Children of married,
intact parents?

27:15.969 --> 27:18.772
What about divorced parents?
Are their children more--

27:18.805 --> 27:20.874
So you are an authority.

27:20.907 --> 27:23.677
Do you know the statistics,
Ms. Frutt?

27:23.710 --> 27:27.013
I know all the risks,
Ms. Garrett.

27:27.047 --> 27:29.015
And you simply decided
to assume them

27:29.049 --> 27:31.217
on behalf of your daughter,
in her best interests?

27:31.251 --> 27:32.953
Objection.
This is badgering now.

27:32.986 --> 27:34.220
It is no such thing.

27:34.254 --> 27:35.889
I am merely
trying to ascertain

27:35.922 --> 27:38.124
whether the witness
knows of these studies,

27:38.158 --> 27:40.961
knows of these statistics,
as she boldly claims

27:40.994 --> 27:43.029
she knows what's best
for her daughter.

27:43.063 --> 27:46.933
I know I am not a statistic
fighting to survive.

27:46.967 --> 27:48.769
I have choices,

27:48.802 --> 27:51.337
and I know my daughter
would be better off

27:51.371 --> 27:54.340
without your client
as a coparent.

27:54.374 --> 27:55.976
Because you make no room

27:56.009 --> 27:58.244
for the possibility
that he can change.

27:58.278 --> 28:00.046
And you don't want
to give him

28:00.080 --> 28:01.715
the chance to change,
do you, Ms. Frutt?

28:01.748 --> 28:04.484
Because it's not
what you want.

28:04.518 --> 28:07.087
Please say it
for the record

28:07.120 --> 28:08.488
because one day,

28:08.522 --> 28:11.725
your daughter
may want to read it.

28:27.040 --> 28:29.375
Well, hello there.

28:29.409 --> 28:32.445
Where am I?

28:32.478 --> 28:34.380
Not Las Vegas,
tell you that.

28:34.414 --> 28:36.517
What happened?

28:36.550 --> 28:39.119
What happened?

28:39.152 --> 28:40.921
You need to ask
what happened?

28:40.954 --> 28:42.388
You had a baby.

28:42.422 --> 28:45.125
What do you mean,
I had a baby?

28:45.158 --> 28:47.393
You had
a little baby girl.

28:47.427 --> 28:49.362
Seven pounds, two ounces.

28:49.395 --> 28:51.264
A beautiful little baby.

28:51.297 --> 28:53.266
What are you talking about?

28:53.299 --> 28:55.135
Maybe you better
lie back down.

28:55.168 --> 28:57.303
No, you lie back down.
I didn't have a baby.

28:57.337 --> 28:59.205
I was blown up.
That's what I was.

28:59.239 --> 29:01.141
What's wrong?

29:01.174 --> 29:05.111
Says she didn't have a baby,
she was blown up.

29:05.145 --> 29:06.947
I know how you feel.

29:06.980 --> 29:09.382
My first child, until they
gave me the epidural--

29:09.415 --> 29:11.518
I didn't have a baby.
What's wrong with you people?

29:11.552 --> 29:14.054
Can I get a phone?
I did not have a baby.

29:14.087 --> 29:15.856
Can we make a call
for you?

29:15.889 --> 29:17.791
Yes, Bobby Donnell.
753--

29:17.824 --> 29:18.959
I know Bobby Donnell.

29:18.992 --> 29:21.995
He had a baby, too.

29:22.028 --> 29:23.496
Where the hell am I?

29:23.530 --> 29:25.431
Is this some rubber room
or something?

29:25.465 --> 29:28.001
I was blown up.
I didn't have a baby.

29:28.034 --> 29:30.070
Roberta,
you need to calm down.

29:30.103 --> 29:32.238
My name is not Roberta.
It's Rebecca.

29:32.272 --> 29:34.808
I was never pregnant.
I didn't have a baby.

29:34.841 --> 29:37.243
I never had a baby.
I don't want a baby.

29:37.277 --> 29:39.179
Can you get that through
your baby-happy head?

29:39.212 --> 29:41.247
Yes, you were blown up.

29:41.281 --> 29:43.550
This is the missing patient.

29:43.584 --> 29:45.185
Your name is Rebecca?

29:45.218 --> 29:49.823
Yes.
Single, without child.

29:49.856 --> 29:53.126
This is the missing patient.

30:05.238 --> 30:08.575
And after he ran off,

30:08.609 --> 30:12.178
I took her and her father
to the hospital.

30:12.212 --> 30:15.849
Are you sure
about the man you saw?

30:15.882 --> 30:16.917
Yes.

30:16.950 --> 30:19.319
He lives in the building.

30:19.352 --> 30:21.287
I know who he is.

30:21.321 --> 30:24.958
Ms. Tritter,
I smell alcohol.

30:24.991 --> 30:26.593
Have you been drinking?

30:26.627 --> 30:29.596
I've had a few beers.

30:29.630 --> 30:32.132
It's been a day.

30:32.165 --> 30:34.868
At the time you saw the rape,
were you drinking then?

30:34.901 --> 30:37.237
Two beers.

30:37.270 --> 30:42.075
Our probable cause hearing
is at 10:00 A. M. tomorrow.

30:42.108 --> 30:45.411
I'd prefer you not drink
before that.

30:45.445 --> 30:48.448
Okay.

30:56.289 --> 30:57.323
Rebecca!

30:57.357 --> 30:59.059
Mom.

30:59.092 --> 31:02.362
-Are you all right?
-I don't know.

31:02.395 --> 31:04.464
Everybody keeps telling me
I had a baby

31:04.497 --> 31:06.533
and that Bobby had a baby.
I don't know what's going on.

31:06.567 --> 31:08.902
There was a Roberta Washington
who checked out.

31:08.935 --> 31:10.270
Rebecca,
I'm Dr. Emmerick.

31:10.303 --> 31:12.906
Can I just look in your eyes
for a second?

31:12.939 --> 31:14.274
It's a miracle.

31:14.307 --> 31:15.509
What happened?

31:15.542 --> 31:18.211
I mean, I remember
some explosion,

31:18.244 --> 31:20.581
and then these wackos
keep telling me

31:20.614 --> 31:22.516
everybody's having babies.

31:22.549 --> 31:25.385
Bec, Lindsay and I
did have a baby.

31:25.418 --> 31:28.221
A little boy.
Robert Gordon Donnell.

31:28.254 --> 31:30.524
You had a baby?

31:30.557 --> 31:32.358
Yeah.

31:34.561 --> 31:37.263
Did I?

31:41.367 --> 31:44.270
How's it going?

31:44.304 --> 31:47.440
Well...

31:47.473 --> 31:49.442
I'm studying up.

31:49.475 --> 31:51.311
I'll be ready.

31:53.479 --> 31:57.150
Am I being selfish?

31:57.183 --> 31:58.685
No.

31:58.719 --> 32:01.054
What's best for that baby?

32:04.157 --> 32:05.692
Not him.

32:05.726 --> 32:08.394
Then that's the answer,
period.

32:13.099 --> 32:14.300
Thank you.

32:17.504 --> 32:19.606
I'll be ready, Ellenor.

32:19.640 --> 32:21.942
We ain't losing this.

32:23.276 --> 32:24.310
Okay.

32:26.446 --> 32:29.015
Okay.

32:48.168 --> 32:50.370
And when I looked down
from the window,

32:50.403 --> 32:52.105
that's when I saw him.

32:52.138 --> 32:53.306
Him being...

32:53.339 --> 32:58.311
That man.
He was raping the girl.

32:58.344 --> 33:00.213
Are you sure it was him?

33:00.246 --> 33:01.682
Positive.

33:01.715 --> 33:03.349
Thank you, Ms. Tritter.

33:06.553 --> 33:09.255
No questions.

33:09.289 --> 33:12.526
You can step down, ma'am.

33:12.559 --> 33:14.060
Ms. Gamble, it's thin,

33:14.094 --> 33:16.129
but I'm finding
probable cause.

33:16.162 --> 33:18.231
The defendant
is bound over for trial,

33:18.264 --> 33:21.067
and trial is scheduled
for march 12th.

33:21.101 --> 33:23.236
Defendant
goes back into custody.

33:23.269 --> 33:25.271
-We're adjourned.
-(gavel pounds)

33:25.305 --> 33:28.074
Ms. Gamble...

33:28.108 --> 33:29.810
Can I talk to you?

33:29.843 --> 33:31.244
Sure.

33:34.848 --> 33:36.717
Um...

33:36.750 --> 33:38.418
will my drinking have to
come up at the trial?

33:38.451 --> 33:40.486
Yes, Ms. Tritter.

33:40.521 --> 33:42.488
You can call me Michelle.

33:42.523 --> 33:45.559
Michelle, it will
definitely come up at trial.

33:45.592 --> 33:48.394
The defendant's lawyer
is going to try

33:48.428 --> 33:50.764
to discredit you
with your drinking.

33:50.797 --> 33:54.134
I've seen stuff on the news
about this already.

33:54.167 --> 33:56.136
I just recently
met a guy,

33:56.169 --> 33:59.773
and I'm also trying
to get a job, you know?

33:59.806 --> 34:01.775
If he makes me out
this big alcoholic...

34:01.808 --> 34:03.777
listen,
I won't lie to you.

34:03.810 --> 34:05.245
It'll be rough.

34:05.278 --> 34:07.848
You're basically
our entire case.

34:07.881 --> 34:09.850
What about the girl?

34:09.882 --> 34:14.420
Well, she's not in the best
emotional shape right now.

34:14.454 --> 34:17.157
I really need you, Michelle.

34:18.759 --> 34:20.226
Okay.

34:30.203 --> 34:33.406
There is simply
no basis whatsoever

34:33.438 --> 34:37.511
for denying Michael hale
some limited custody.

34:37.543 --> 34:40.813
Every study has shown
undeniably,

34:40.847 --> 34:43.349
the child's
psychological well-being

34:43.382 --> 34:46.286
is best served with a connection
to the father.

34:46.319 --> 34:47.821
For young children,

34:47.853 --> 34:49.822
it affects
cognitive development,

34:49.856 --> 34:53.359
social competence,
the ability to trust.

34:53.393 --> 34:56.129
Some studies have even linked

34:56.161 --> 34:59.766
the father's involvement
to a higher I. Q.

34:59.800 --> 35:02.669
Paternal involvement
during middle childhood

35:02.703 --> 35:05.639
has been known to have
a positive effect

35:05.672 --> 35:07.207
on school success.

35:07.240 --> 35:10.210
Your Honor, these studies
are as sobering

35:10.243 --> 35:12.145
as they are unanimous.

35:12.178 --> 35:16.149
Fatherless kids are
more susceptible to depression,

35:16.182 --> 35:20.687
more likely to commit crimes,
to drop out of school,

35:20.721 --> 35:22.789
to commit suicide,

35:22.823 --> 35:25.859
11 times more likely
to be violent,

35:25.892 --> 35:28.695
more likely
to abuse drugs.

35:28.729 --> 35:31.765
Does this mean
a single mother

35:31.798 --> 35:34.768
can't successfully
raise a child?

35:34.801 --> 35:37.704
Of course not.
It happens a lot.

35:37.738 --> 35:39.673
And to be fair,

35:39.706 --> 35:42.809
studies also show
that parental conflict

35:42.843 --> 35:44.811
can have
a negative impact.

35:44.845 --> 35:46.713
But the likelihood

35:46.747 --> 35:49.650
is that this child
will be better off

35:49.683 --> 35:52.519
with a connection
to her dad.

35:52.553 --> 35:54.187
All we're asking for

35:54.220 --> 35:57.190
is that he be allowed
to be involved.

35:57.223 --> 36:01.895
With virtually every study,
every child psychologist

36:01.928 --> 36:04.898
concurring that this is
in the best interests

36:04.931 --> 36:06.633
of the child,

36:06.667 --> 36:08.602
how can Ms. Frutt say no?

36:08.635 --> 36:10.604
How can she not be willing

36:10.637 --> 36:13.339
to even give Michael hale
a chance?

36:13.373 --> 36:16.342
If he's willing
to adjust his work,

36:16.376 --> 36:18.278
to change his lifestyle--

36:18.311 --> 36:20.280
If he's matured

36:20.313 --> 36:23.349
and he's ready
to accept responsibility.

36:23.383 --> 36:27.621
Ellenor Frutt doesn't want
to give him that chance

36:27.654 --> 36:32.826
because she wants to maintain
complete control over that baby,

36:32.859 --> 36:36.296
and even if Michael hale
were the perfect father,

36:36.329 --> 36:39.365
she would hold fast
to that position.

36:39.399 --> 36:42.669
That is a selfish position.

36:42.703 --> 36:45.839
It has absolutely
nothing to do

36:45.872 --> 36:49.409
with the best interests
of this baby.

36:58.719 --> 36:59.920
Ellenor.

36:59.953 --> 37:01.287
I want to respond.

37:01.321 --> 37:02.623
-Let me.
-Jimmy, I want--

37:02.656 --> 37:04.625
Ellenor, sit.

37:16.503 --> 37:18.371
I read all those studies,

37:18.404 --> 37:20.841
I spoke with several experts,

37:20.874 --> 37:22.843
and Ms. Garrett's right.

37:22.876 --> 37:26.379
Better the child have
some connection to her father,

37:26.412 --> 37:28.949
better he be involved
in her life

37:28.982 --> 37:30.416
right from the start.

37:30.450 --> 37:32.919
That's the best-case scenario,

37:32.953 --> 37:36.757
but that scenario wasn't
available to Ellenor Frutt.

37:36.790 --> 37:38.491
She wasn't with a man.

37:38.525 --> 37:40.927
She decided she wanted
to be a single parent,

37:40.961 --> 37:42.863
so she went to a friend

37:42.896 --> 37:45.498
and asked him
to be a donor.

37:45.532 --> 37:47.500
She never
would have done so

37:47.534 --> 37:50.504
had there been a condition
of his parental involvement.

37:50.537 --> 37:51.505
Never.

37:51.538 --> 37:54.440
All these studies--

37:54.474 --> 37:58.579
None of them apply to this
particular situation.

37:58.612 --> 38:02.448
As for the best interests
of this particular child,

38:02.482 --> 38:04.951
yes, we maintain
she is better off

38:04.985 --> 38:07.888
with Ellenor
acting as a single parent,

38:07.921 --> 38:09.890
better off without Mr. Hale.

38:09.923 --> 38:11.725
He failed with his son,

38:11.758 --> 38:13.994
he's never exercised
any real degree

38:14.027 --> 38:15.996
of maturity or responsibility.

38:16.029 --> 38:18.999
There are plenty of studies
to show

38:19.032 --> 38:21.535
the damage
caused to a child

38:21.568 --> 38:25.539
when a bond is broken
once a parent takes off.

38:25.572 --> 38:27.741
We maintain it's a risk

38:27.774 --> 38:31.344
letting this baby become
emotionally attached

38:31.377 --> 38:32.979
to Mr. Hale.

38:33.013 --> 38:35.481
Ms. Garrett says,
"Why not try?

38:35.516 --> 38:38.552
Let's just see.
What's the harm?"

38:38.585 --> 38:41.454
Well, it does do harm
in failure.

38:41.487 --> 38:44.490
There are studies
to show that.

38:44.525 --> 38:47.027
Ellenor Frutt
is the only person

38:47.060 --> 38:50.463
who can be trusted
with this child's welfare.

38:50.496 --> 38:53.499
She's the only one
who's earned that trust.

38:53.534 --> 38:55.101
We don't let sperm donors

38:55.135 --> 38:57.904
from sperm banks
across the country--

38:57.938 --> 39:00.507
We don't let them
change their minds,

39:00.541 --> 39:02.509
start requesting DNA tests

39:02.543 --> 39:05.111
so they can
track down their offspring

39:05.145 --> 39:08.014
and insert themselves
into the kids' lives.

39:08.048 --> 39:10.150
He's looking
for special treatment

39:10.183 --> 39:13.053
just because he knows
where his sperm went.

39:13.086 --> 39:14.688
A deal was made.

39:14.721 --> 39:17.624
Michael hale has made
no demonstration

39:17.658 --> 39:20.160
with his past
or present behavior

39:20.193 --> 39:22.863
that his involvement
as a parent

39:22.896 --> 39:25.899
would run to the benefit
of this child.

39:25.932 --> 39:29.135
Accordingly,
I would ask the court

39:29.169 --> 39:33.139
not to overturn
the rights of my client

39:33.173 --> 39:37.410
pursuant to this valid,
legally enforceable contract.

39:48.021 --> 39:50.423
Why can't it
just be over?

39:50.456 --> 39:52.058
I want it to be over.

39:52.092 --> 39:53.660
Oh, honey.

39:53.694 --> 39:55.729
All they need
is for you to testify

39:55.762 --> 39:59.099
as to what happened
and who did it.

39:59.132 --> 40:01.134
Please, Daddy.

40:01.167 --> 40:04.070
Look, we don't have to
talk about this right now.

40:04.104 --> 40:05.471
(door opens)

40:05.506 --> 40:08.008
Hey. How's it going?

40:08.041 --> 40:10.010
You tell us.

40:10.043 --> 40:13.113
Could I talk to you
outside for a second?

40:13.146 --> 40:15.181
All I have
is an eyewitness

40:15.215 --> 40:17.083
from a considerable distance

40:17.117 --> 40:19.586
who was probably
under the influence.

40:19.620 --> 40:23.557
Even with your daughter
testifying, I--

40:23.590 --> 40:26.459
She's easily shakable,
Mr. McGowan.

40:26.492 --> 40:27.594
What are you telling me?

40:27.628 --> 40:30.463
It doesn't look good.

40:30.496 --> 40:36.002
He lives in our building.

40:36.036 --> 40:39.105
You have to get him,
Ms. Gamble.

40:39.139 --> 40:41.508
He lives in our building.

40:41.542 --> 40:44.210
You can't lose this bastard.

40:44.244 --> 40:46.880
It'll be tough, Mr. McGowan.

40:46.913 --> 40:49.550
He lives in our building.

40:56.222 --> 40:57.490
WOMAN: All rise.

41:04.164 --> 41:05.699
Be seated.

41:13.006 --> 41:16.142
I've never had
a case like this.

41:16.176 --> 41:18.044
There's contract law,

41:18.078 --> 41:22.048
and there's best interests
of the child.

41:22.082 --> 41:25.051
As a matter
of public policy,

41:25.085 --> 41:27.253
I have to give the latter
more weight.

41:27.287 --> 41:30.724
Ms. Frutt,
all the prevailing studies

41:30.757 --> 41:34.728
favor a child's connection
with a father.

41:34.761 --> 41:37.197
While I don't doubt
a single mother

41:37.230 --> 41:39.733
can successfully
raise a child,

41:39.766 --> 41:41.802
I don't think
single parenting

41:41.835 --> 41:44.805
gives you or your daughter
an advantage.

41:44.838 --> 41:50.744
I certainly salute
your resolve and fortitude.

41:50.777 --> 41:53.847
But I am reminded
of Penelope Leach's words.

41:53.880 --> 41:56.116
"Why is it
socially reprehensible

41:56.149 --> 41:58.652
"for a man
to leave a baby fatherless,

41:58.685 --> 42:01.855
"but courageous or admirable
for a woman to have a baby

42:01.888 --> 42:03.690
whom she knows will be so?"

42:03.724 --> 42:07.694
In looking
at this particular case,

42:07.728 --> 42:13.233
I don't know whether this child
will be better served

42:13.266 --> 42:15.869
by Ms. Frutt acting alone

42:15.902 --> 42:18.772
or with Mr. Hale's
involvement.

42:18.805 --> 42:21.307
It's crystal ball gazing,

42:21.341 --> 42:23.977
and I just don't know...

42:24.010 --> 42:29.850
and I don't like to rule
on statistical probabilities.

42:29.883 --> 42:33.654
Without clear
and convincing evidence,

42:33.687 --> 42:39.159
I'm going to let the contract
tip the scale.

42:39.192 --> 42:41.995
I find the agreement
at issue here valid.

42:42.028 --> 42:43.597
Plaintiff's legal rights
as a father

42:43.630 --> 42:45.298
are thereby terminated.

42:45.331 --> 42:47.868
The request to add
Mr. Hale's name

42:47.901 --> 42:50.871
to the birth certificate
upon delivery is denied.

42:50.904 --> 42:52.072
And we are adjourned.

43:30.276 --> 43:33.179
â™ª (theme)

43:56.069 --> 43:57.203
You stinker!
