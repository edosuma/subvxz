00:09.240 --> 00:11.879
<i>Bones, where's the kid?</i>

00:14.000 --> 00:17.549
- Who's that with Zack?
- Naomi from Palaeontology.

00:17.640 --> 00:23.954
Naomi and Zack slept together a month ago.
Since then, she hasn't returned a single call.

00:25.120 --> 00:28.032
- You working on anything interesting?
- Me?

00:28.120 --> 00:32.432
Yeah, yeah. A three-dimensionaI modeI
of an Etruscan buriaI crypt.

00:32.520 --> 00:34.795
- You?
- Yeah. Oh, God, yeah. Very exciting.

00:34.880 --> 00:37.678
- Some silt profiles.
- Mm, mm.

00:38.800 --> 00:41.075
God, Etruscan buriaI crypts are so boring.

00:41.160 --> 00:43.594
Oh, man, I know.
I mean, silt profiles?

00:43.680 --> 00:46.478
- You know what we need?
- A murder investigation.

00:46.560 --> 00:49.313
Brennan and Booth
are out front now waiting for Zack.

00:49.400 --> 00:51.789
There's a case? Why didn't you say so?

00:51.880 --> 00:53.677
Zack, you gotta go!

00:53.760 --> 00:56.558
Oh, she really bolted.
Doesn't look good for Zack.

00:56.640 --> 00:59.438
- Come on, Zack. Shake it off. Be a man.
- You OK, honey?

00:59.520 --> 01:01.988
She said, "Take a hint. "
I asked, "What hint?"

01:02.080 --> 01:05.789
Naomi said if she told me,
it wouldn't be a hint, it would be a statement.

01:05.880 --> 01:07.836
Throw yourself into your work.

01:07.920 --> 01:11.151
You really do hate slime profiles.
Have a little compassion.

01:11.240 --> 01:14.198
I understood the words.
I do not comprehend her meaning.

01:14.280 --> 01:16.157
- Did you tell Naomi that?
- Yes.

01:16.240 --> 01:20.199
She said, "Ask your friends", if I have any.

01:22.680 --> 01:25.194
Hodgins is right.
Let's not keep Booth waiting.

01:25.280 --> 01:30.877
- Somebody is decomposing as we speak.
- Get out there and bring us home a case.

01:32.000 --> 01:38.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:39.160 --> 01:43.472
- We've got a dead body in a prep schooI.
- Good morning to you, too.

01:43.560 --> 01:46.552
You're successfuI with women, right?
They like you.

01:46.640 --> 01:50.872
- It's prestigious, a lot of rich kids.
- I thought it was good to say good morning.

01:50.960 --> 01:54.396
If a woman said to you,
"Take a hint", what would it mean?

01:54.480 --> 01:57.472
Can we just concentrate on the job?

02:00.000 --> 02:04.596
Thank you. Now, I know the sheriff out there.
She's mostly OK.

02:04.680 --> 02:07.114
But the schooI's got a lot of pull in the county

02:07.200 --> 02:10.237
and she's probably
trying to scrape the case off on us.

02:10.320 --> 02:14.313
What I'm saying is it's notjust a crime scene,
it's a politicaI situation.

02:14.400 --> 02:17.631
So when we get there,
you follow my lead and you pay attention.

02:17.720 --> 02:21.315
You'd call after every sexuaI encounter?
That's the good thing...

02:21.400 --> 02:25.473
Look, this is a work mode. This is
a work zone. You do not talk sex at work.

02:25.560 --> 02:27.391
First I'm too task-oriented,

02:27.480 --> 02:31.314
then when I say good morning,
you say I should concentrate on the job.

02:31.400 --> 02:34.790
Look, we got about a 45-minute drive, hm?

02:34.880 --> 02:38.350
What do you say
we pass it in quiet meditation?

02:52.320 --> 02:55.039
<i>- Can I talk now?
- No.</i>

02:55.120 --> 02:59.113
<i>- OK, we're here now.
- My car, my rules, period.</i>

03:01.800 --> 03:04.473
FBI. Seeley Booth
and a forensic anthropologist.

03:04.560 --> 03:07.279
Dr Temperance Brennan,
Jeffersonian Institute.

03:07.360 --> 03:09.157
Plus one crack assistant.

03:09.240 --> 03:14.394
- I'll need to see some ID, please.
- This reminds me of where I went to schooI.

03:14.480 --> 03:20.157
You don't get much farther from the reaI
world. Whose kids go here is classified.

03:20.240 --> 03:23.949
Agent Booth, Dr Brennan, I'll lead
you to Mr Sanders, head of security.

03:24.040 --> 03:30.229
- Aim us in the right direction. We'll find it.
- All outsiders are to be escorted, sir.

03:31.440 --> 03:37.037
<i>Huh. "Omnia mea mecum porto. " What does
that mean, huh? "Regular people stay out"?</i>

03:37.120 --> 03:39.395
<i>"I carry with me all my things. "</i>

03:45.840 --> 03:47.751
I knew that.

03:52.720 --> 03:57.316
- Hey, Seeley. How's it going?
- Congratulations on being elected full sheriff.

03:57.400 --> 03:59.356
Very impressive.

03:59.440 --> 04:03.672
I'm Leo Sanders, head of security.
This is Headmaster Peter Ronson.

04:03.760 --> 04:07.799
- Where are the human remains?
- Dr Brennan and her assistant Jack, uh...

04:07.880 --> 04:11.236
- Zack Addy.
- Could you show me to the remains?

04:11.320 --> 04:15.313
<i>Even though the schooI was mostly
empty during the two-week break...</i>

04:15.400 --> 04:18.471
I don't know if you remember me,
but we worked together.

04:18.560 --> 04:22.519
- Bones found in a culvert a year ago?
- I remember the bones and the culvert.

04:22.600 --> 04:27.310
Bones, being nice to the locals and
remembering their names, it wouldn't hurt.

04:27.400 --> 04:32.269
Our term break ends tomorrow. I'd like to
get this tidied up so the students never know.

04:32.360 --> 04:35.477
But we don't know what happened.
Did anyone touch the body?

04:35.560 --> 04:38.870
<i>- I doubt it. It's grisly.
- Not big on small talk, is she?</i>

04:38.960 --> 04:41.554
<i>Dr Brennan's very focused.</i>

04:43.800 --> 04:46.837
Where are the remains?

04:46.920 --> 04:48.273
Bones.

04:59.440 --> 05:00.998
Is that a student?

05:01.080 --> 05:04.072
It's a secure campus.
Must be student, staff or faculty.

05:04.160 --> 05:06.196
Video first. Don't disturb the crows.

05:06.280 --> 05:08.874
That'd be a shame -
disturb the flesh-eating birds.

05:08.960 --> 05:13.909
Want to increase the perimeter? Gentlemen,
give my forensic anthropologist some room.

05:14.000 --> 05:16.116
<i>Y our forensic anthropologist?</i>

05:16.200 --> 05:19.078
Agent Booth,
if you decide it's suicide, it's my problem.

05:19.160 --> 05:23.438
Actually, the person who decides
if this was a suicide is me.

05:23.520 --> 05:28.389
- Give the bone lady some room.
- I'm glad we had that chat about being nice.

05:28.480 --> 05:33.270
I don't like sheriffs. They're elected.
Their goaI is being re-elected, not the truth.

05:33.360 --> 05:34.952
- I got video.
- Go to stills.

05:35.040 --> 05:39.272
- Can we just get him down from there?
- There's a lot of work to do before that.

05:39.360 --> 05:41.271
- Step back.
- I'm the headmaster.

05:41.360 --> 05:43.510
And this is a crime scene. Step back.

05:58.400 --> 06:01.517
- I'm gonna need an evidence bag.
- Heads up.

06:02.560 --> 06:06.030
<i>I'm gonna need a bigger bag.</i>

06:42.120 --> 06:45.351
I make this a male.
Approximately five foot six, 130 pounds.

06:45.440 --> 06:51.072
From the looks of his sternum and skull,
I'd say mid-adolescence, say 14 to 17.

06:51.160 --> 06:54.755
- High cheekbones. You think Asian?
- I'm getting a Hispanic vibe.

06:54.840 --> 06:59.152
<i>There is a significant Crematogaster
ant colony in the tree that fed on the body,</i>

06:59.240 --> 07:03.597
as well as tabanid maggots. I'll give you a
time of death when I find out who ate what.

07:03.680 --> 07:07.719
Check for insect pupa and larva. See
what drugs might have been in his system.

07:07.800 --> 07:09.836
He was wearing this.

07:09.920 --> 07:11.717
<i>Catholic boy.</i>

07:13.160 --> 07:15.720
One-by-two forceps.

07:20.960 --> 07:23.758
- What is that?
- Cochlear implant.

07:23.840 --> 07:25.512
The birds were trying to get it.

07:25.600 --> 07:28.319
That would set a boy apart from others,
being deaf.

07:28.400 --> 07:30.118
Get a seriaI number.

07:30.200 --> 07:33.556
I'll get X-rays and 3-D imaging
of the entire skeleton.

07:33.640 --> 07:36.154
I didn't talk at schooI.
I didn't kill myself.

07:36.240 --> 07:40.950
That wasn't a high schooI.
It was an experimentaI eugenics programme.

07:47.280 --> 07:50.272
<i>How hard is it
to find which student is missing?</i>

07:50.360 --> 07:54.114
We can't call parents and say,
"We found a body. Where is your child?"

07:54.200 --> 07:57.670
- We can do a roll call.
- Our high-risk students are accounted for.

07:57.760 --> 07:59.990
- High risk?
- The ones with bodyguards.

08:00.080 --> 08:04.392
- What are our options vis-Ã -vis publicity?
- Not my concern.

08:04.480 --> 08:07.756
There are students we don't want
the whole world to know about.

08:07.840 --> 08:12.356
It's a suicide. We're not asking you
to forego the glory of catching a murderer.

08:14.720 --> 08:16.711
Excuse me. Sorry.

08:16.800 --> 08:18.916
Booth.

08:19.000 --> 08:21.560
We'll have the identity within the hour.

08:21.640 --> 08:24.154
<i>- That's fast.
- Know what a cochlear implant is?</i>

08:24.240 --> 08:26.356
- Hearing aid?
- Not exactly.

08:26.440 --> 08:29.193
It's a more sophisticated
piece of equipment...

08:29.280 --> 08:32.556
- Can you get the seriaI number?
- Yes. What's interesting...

08:32.640 --> 08:34.517
Oh, you can fill me in later.

08:34.600 --> 08:37.797
<i>- But the interesting thing is that his...
- That's correct.</i>

08:37.880 --> 08:41.236
- What?
- That is interesting.

08:41.320 --> 08:44.756
- Are you drunk or something?
- We'll catch up later and...

08:44.840 --> 08:47.035
I'm not certain his death is a suicide.

08:47.120 --> 08:51.910
You know, we'll grab some Chinese food and
you can fill me in later on the boring details.

08:52.000 --> 08:53.831
Sorry.

08:53.920 --> 08:56.753
Death is upsetting
to a community as tight as ours.

08:56.840 --> 09:00.196
Well, you're famous
for keeping your students safe.

09:00.280 --> 09:03.272
You can't be held responsible
if a student kills himself.

09:03.360 --> 09:06.432
We all agree that suicide
is the only feasible conclusion.

09:06.520 --> 09:10.718
- We understand each other.
- Hm. Sure as hell do.

09:13.160 --> 09:18.029
I'll need a complete enrolment list
including teachers, staff, students.

09:18.120 --> 09:19.997
That's extremely confidentiaI.

09:20.080 --> 09:24.278
Well, you know,
luckily I'm good at keeping secrets.

09:33.960 --> 09:36.633
What? It's not suicide?
What the hell is that?

09:36.720 --> 09:40.235
<i>We can't have just anyone
contaminate the boring details.</i>

09:40.320 --> 09:45.519
The boring details... Do not push me. "Boring
details" was my signaI for you to stop talking.

09:45.600 --> 09:47.556
- I want a card.
- I want a gun.

09:47.640 --> 09:49.551
- You shot someone.
- He was a bad guy.

09:49.640 --> 09:52.074
- Who's our victim?
- All the boring details?

09:52.160 --> 09:56.039
- Let it go, Bones. Move on.
- Don't call me Bones.

09:56.120 --> 09:59.510
We traced the implant
to Dr Maurice Ledbetter at Cedars-Sinai,

09:59.600 --> 10:02.956
who placed it in a boy named Nestor Olivos.

10:03.040 --> 10:08.034
Nestor Olivos, student visa,
son of a Venezuelan ambassador. What else?

10:08.120 --> 10:11.112
- You want all the boring details?
- Let it go, Bones.

10:11.200 --> 10:13.270
Don't call me Bones!

10:14.200 --> 10:18.239
- The boy's hyoid bone is broken.
- Strangulation, it's always broken.

10:18.320 --> 10:23.713
- In adults. This was a boy.
- His hyoid is flexible, unbreakable.

10:23.800 --> 10:28.715
Well, maybe the kid's got some kind of
Venezuelan brittle-bone syndrome.

10:29.440 --> 10:31.908
I'm just trying to help. So he was murdered?

10:32.000 --> 10:35.356
I don't know what happened to the boy.
I don't have all the facts.

10:44.560 --> 10:47.677
How hard can it be?
A kid hanging from a tree. It's a suicide.

10:47.760 --> 10:49.910
Is Hanover Prep stirring the pudding?

10:50.000 --> 10:53.356
Of course. Every mover and shaker's
connected to that schooI.

10:53.440 --> 10:57.672
- "The future of the country's at stake. "
- I want to declare it a murder to shake...

10:57.760 --> 11:02.470
I'm not gonna declare it a murder
just so you can "shake things up".

11:03.280 --> 11:08.832
- The evidence is ambiguous at best.
- Well, unambiguise it, please, Dr Goodman.

11:08.920 --> 11:13.869
Look, you're experienced within your field
of bones, right? Doesn't your gut say suicide?

11:13.960 --> 11:16.713
- I don't use my gut for that, sir.
- She doesn't.

11:16.800 --> 11:21.874
Like all of us at the Jeffersonian, Dr
Brennan prefers science to the digestive tract.

11:21.960 --> 11:24.269
- What about your gut?
- My gut says it stinks.

11:24.360 --> 11:28.239
<i>- Smells with his gut, what's his nose for?
- All right, all right.</i>

11:28.320 --> 11:32.916
In order for an investigation to occur,
you, Dr Brennan, have to declare it a murder.

11:33.000 --> 11:35.309
Without an investigation, we can't,

11:35.400 --> 11:39.109
but there's no investigation
unless Dr Brennan declares it a murder.

11:39.200 --> 11:42.033
Shall I send for a philosopher?

11:42.120 --> 11:44.076
They're saying it's my call.

11:44.160 --> 11:48.039
<i>You see?
It's how you talk to these people.</i>

11:50.640 --> 11:54.235
My officiaI finding is that Nestor Olivos...

11:59.320 --> 12:02.198
is a victim of a homicide.

12:16.720 --> 12:18.631
- Thank you.
- For what?

12:18.720 --> 12:21.518
- For going with my instincts in there.
- I did not.

12:21.600 --> 12:26.993
I bought time to find the facts I need
to tell me what happened to Nestor Olivos.

12:27.080 --> 12:30.834
- What's with you and the schooI?
- They thought we understood each other.

12:30.920 --> 12:34.151
I don't like people
who think they're better than others.

12:34.240 --> 12:38.597
- Some people are better than others.
- What you just said there is so un-American.

12:38.680 --> 12:41.717
All men are equaI.
Either you believe that or you don't.

12:41.800 --> 12:48.433
Some people are smarter than others.
There's no use being offended by the fact.

12:48.520 --> 12:52.752
- What are we gonna tell Nestor's parents?
- We tell them their son was found dead.

12:52.840 --> 12:56.276
"We're looking into it.
Sorry for your loss. "

12:56.360 --> 12:59.477
- And we are.
- What?

12:59.560 --> 13:02.074
Sorry for their loss. It's sad.

13:02.160 --> 13:04.594
- Try to remember that.
- I'm not a sociopath.

13:04.680 --> 13:09.754
You're bad with people, OK?
No use being offended by the fact.

13:13.600 --> 13:18.435
<i>- Hanging from a tree at the schooI?
- I'm afraid so, Ambassador Olivos.</i>

13:18.520 --> 13:23.355
We will provide you with full details
when Dr Brennan finishes her investigation.

13:23.440 --> 13:29.117
- Will you need us to identify his remains?
- That won't be necessary.

13:36.000 --> 13:38.070
When did you last hear from Nestor?

13:38.160 --> 13:41.994
A few days after his holiday began.
He went with a friend to Nova Scotia.

13:42.080 --> 13:44.833
- We received an emaiI.
- Can we have a copy?

13:44.920 --> 13:49.038
It'll help us determine
exactly when the victim died.

13:49.120 --> 13:52.795
Your son. We're very sorry for your loss.

13:52.880 --> 13:57.237
There was nothing to suggest in the emaiI
that Nestor was unhappy, not enough to...

13:57.320 --> 13:59.470
We would like to take him home.

14:01.000 --> 14:04.629
We must petition the church
to bury him in consecrated ground.

14:04.720 --> 14:09.157
Nestor was an altar boy.
They will bury him properly.

14:10.080 --> 14:11.991
When will you release him to us?

14:12.080 --> 14:15.277
That's up to Dr Brennan.

14:21.320 --> 14:24.676
- What did Naomi mean by, "Take a hint"?
- Ooh.

14:25.600 --> 14:28.478
- What did I do wrong?
- It's not what you did wrong.

14:28.560 --> 14:30.869
It's what you didn't do.

14:30.960 --> 14:34.111
- Where do you learn this?
- Some things you learn by doing.

14:34.200 --> 14:37.988
Riding a bike, driving a car,
pleasing a woman.

14:38.080 --> 14:42.676
- I can't ride a bike or drive a car.
- Or, apparently, please a woman.

14:42.760 --> 14:47.117
I need specific instructions -
a list of techniques or a sequence of moves.

14:47.200 --> 14:50.192
- I'm not the guy to ask.
- You've slept with 10,000 women.

14:50.280 --> 14:52.475
Our relationship is about what's up here.

14:52.560 --> 14:57.350
What you need to do
is talk to someone more... earthy.

15:05.320 --> 15:08.153
As a psychiatrist,
I'm bound by patient confidentiality.

15:08.240 --> 15:14.110
In the absence of a warrant, I can't divulge
the specifics of my meetings with Nestor Olivos.

15:14.200 --> 15:16.998
I can tell you that
he was at extreme risk of suicide.

15:17.080 --> 15:19.878
There are no indications
he was on antidepressants.

15:19.960 --> 15:24.511
- I can only make recommendations.
- Was he depressed enough to hang himself?

15:24.600 --> 15:29.833
He was alienated by culture, language, his
handicap, his own sociaI awkwardness, yes.

15:29.920 --> 15:35.074
Thank you for coming down, Dr Petty.
As we suspected, suicide.

15:35.160 --> 15:38.630
A depressed and lonely boy
hangs himself over the holiday.

15:38.720 --> 15:43.111
So how does the son of an ambassador go
missing for two weeks and nobody notices?

15:43.200 --> 15:46.749
The schooI thought
Nestor was vacationing with his roommate.

15:46.840 --> 15:52.278
The schooI requested and received
a waiver from Ambassador Olivos.

15:52.360 --> 15:55.591
I was in Venezuela last year.
It's unstable politically.

15:55.680 --> 15:58.990
The family received threats -
we were cognisant of that -

15:59.080 --> 16:02.755
but you aren't suggesting
that some kind of Venezuelan hit squad

16:02.840 --> 16:05.149
assassinated a student at Hanover Prep?

16:05.240 --> 16:09.552
Like the doctor said, it's a simple case
of a depressed boy ending his life,

16:09.640 --> 16:11.995
not a Tom Clancy noveI.

16:12.080 --> 16:16.756
Yeah. We'll start with Nestor's roommate
tomorrow morning.

16:18.480 --> 16:21.119
It's your investigation.

16:30.480 --> 16:32.118
Hey.

16:32.200 --> 16:36.352
- I'll say this. She's tall.
- Temperance Brennan, meet Sid, the owner.

16:36.440 --> 16:40.069
- Hey. Bone lady.
- The sign says "Wong Foo's".

16:40.160 --> 16:42.913
Family name changed at Ellis Island.

16:43.000 --> 16:45.468
- I'll get your meaI.
- But we didn't order.

16:45.560 --> 16:49.030
Sid knows what people want
better than they do.

16:49.120 --> 16:52.078
Nestor's bones are normaI.
Not brittle in any way.

16:52.160 --> 16:54.276
This is my getaway place, you know?

16:54.360 --> 16:57.670
The grooves left in the branch
are too deep for Nestor's weight.

16:57.760 --> 16:59.591
Please, everyone, just sit down.

16:59.680 --> 17:04.628
Eggs and larva show that the insects which
fed on the body are indigenous to the tree,

17:04.720 --> 17:07.791
which means he died there
approximately ten to 14 days ago.

17:07.880 --> 17:10.791
- I'll have the seven-organ soup.
- You don't order.

17:10.880 --> 17:14.919
He didn't void. Somebody hangs themselves,
bodily fluids everywhere.

17:15.000 --> 17:18.628
There was plenty of effluent in his clothes,
but postdecomposition.

17:18.720 --> 17:21.951
As the body swells, it bursts.
How does he know what you want?

17:22.040 --> 17:23.916
- He has a knack.
- His name is Sid.

17:24.000 --> 17:26.992
Birds ate his eyes, ears,
worked their way into the skull.

17:27.079 --> 17:29.878
Birds pecking - could that crack the hyoid?

17:29.960 --> 17:33.669
No. It's caused by the rope
against his throat, not postmortem.

17:33.760 --> 17:36.320
You put a sensitive adolescent
in a prep schooI,

17:36.400 --> 17:40.871
add alienation, culturaI differences,
pressure from high-achieving parents.

17:40.960 --> 17:43.315
- It could be suicide.
- It's not a suicide.

17:43.400 --> 17:46.312
Because Booth thinks
prep schools turn out criminals.

17:46.400 --> 17:48.550
We all went to private schooI.

17:48.640 --> 17:52.349
- We fight criminals. We're crime-fighters.
- No. Not... You're...

17:52.440 --> 17:56.194
- I'm just saying it's not a suicide.
- I'm a big believer in instinct.

17:56.280 --> 17:59.352
Finally a squint with an open mind.

17:59.440 --> 18:03.149
You have no idea how open-minded I can be.

18:03.680 --> 18:07.992
<i>What's with these pictures?
This is a restaurant. People come here to eat.</i>

18:08.080 --> 18:11.709
What's the matter with you?
What the hell did you bring in my place?

18:11.800 --> 18:14.951
- I had nothing to do with it.
- This is exactly what I want.

18:15.040 --> 18:19.431
<i>- It's amazing. The guy definitely has a knack.
- Ooh!</i>

18:19.520 --> 18:21.511
- You do take orders.
- Of course we do.

18:21.600 --> 18:24.592
But it's always better
when you leave it to me. Booth.

18:24.680 --> 18:28.150
All right, I'll take care of it.
The boy died ten to 14 days ago?

18:28.240 --> 18:30.117
Bugs buzz, but they do not lie.

18:30.200 --> 18:33.875
Hodgins is very good at using insects
to ascertain the time of death.

18:33.960 --> 18:38.511
How do you explain an emaiI that was
sent seven days ago from Nova Scotia?

18:38.600 --> 18:41.114
See? Look at that. It stinks.

18:41.200 --> 18:44.510
Go ahead, smell it.
You know you want to smell it. It stinks.

18:44.600 --> 18:47.194
- Don't smell that.
- No, no, you gotta taste it.

18:47.280 --> 18:51.319
- Angela, it's so good. Mm.
- That's really gross.

18:51.880 --> 18:55.873
<i>- Y ou and Nestor were roommates?
- Y es, sir.</i>

18:55.960 --> 19:00.556
<i>- Y ou invited him over for the vacation?
- We have a summer home on Cape Breton.</i>

19:00.640 --> 19:02.835
<i>Nestor decided to go back to Venezuela.</i>

19:02.920 --> 19:06.356
- What did the other kids say about Nestor?
- Nestor was different.

19:06.440 --> 19:10.228
He used to be deaf so he talked like...
Some kids called him "retard".

19:10.320 --> 19:13.949
- Tucker, don't say retard.
- I never called him that.

19:14.040 --> 19:18.272
He went to church even though nobody
made him go. People thought that was weird.

19:18.360 --> 19:23.070
- Did Nestor have a girlfriend?
- There was a girI he liked. He never said who.

19:23.160 --> 19:27.517
- Tucker, you're Iying to a federaI agent.
- CarefuI, Agent Booth.

19:27.600 --> 19:31.832
An emaiI was sent to Nestor's parents
saying what a great time he was having.

19:31.920 --> 19:35.799
The only thing is
that Nestor was already dead.

19:35.880 --> 19:38.030
- Was it you?
- I'd prefer he didn't answer.

19:38.120 --> 19:41.669
No, Dawn. If it was
Tucker, he has to admit it.

19:42.720 --> 19:46.156
- You know the dodge.
- You backed him up cos he was with a girI.

19:46.240 --> 19:49.198
- Tucker!
- I know. I'm sorry, but he begged me.

19:49.280 --> 19:52.511
- What girI?
- I don't know. I thought Nestor made her up.

19:52.600 --> 19:55.273
I sent an emaiI. That's all.

20:01.440 --> 20:03.635
Dr Brennan,

20:03.720 --> 20:06.871
can you spare a moment
for the Venezuelan ambassador?

20:06.960 --> 20:08.951
Thank you.

20:10.000 --> 20:12.355
Is there something I can do for you?

20:12.440 --> 20:16.911
I understand that you are very good
at yourjob, Dr Brennan.

20:17.000 --> 20:21.312
- But I think you are not a mother, correct?
- No. I'm not a mother.

20:22.960 --> 20:25.349
Please watch this.

20:29.880 --> 20:34.829
All a mother wants to know
is that she has raised her child well,

20:34.920 --> 20:37.559
that he will grow up to be a good man.

20:38.520 --> 20:40.511
I will never see this.

20:40.600 --> 20:43.433
I will never know.

20:46.000 --> 20:48.594
The day Nestor received his implant...

20:48.680 --> 20:50.318
<i>Nestor.</i>

20:51.320 --> 20:52.958
<i>Te amo, mi amor.</i>

20:53.040 --> 20:56.635
- The first day he could hear.
- The first thing he heard was my voice.

20:56.720 --> 21:00.633
<i>Te amo, mi amor. Y o... SÃ­...</i>

21:00.720 --> 21:04.110
His mother's voice. I told him I loved him.

21:04.840 --> 21:10.039
<i>Y o te amo. Â¿Me entiendes?
Dile a papi que nos quiere. Dile que...</i>

21:10.120 --> 21:15.990
The child who has lived through this miracle
would never take his own life.

21:17.000 --> 21:18.831
You're a scientist.

21:18.920 --> 21:22.959
You need more than
a mother's reassurance, fine.

21:23.040 --> 21:27.955
My husband and I have many enemies.
That is why I sent Nestor to Hanover.

21:28.040 --> 21:30.713
They promised us that he would be safe.

21:30.800 --> 21:33.837
What if they failed?
They would not want to admit it.

21:33.920 --> 21:37.959
They would do everything they could
to bias you toward suicide.

21:38.040 --> 21:41.635
I promise you I will find out the truth.

21:44.040 --> 21:46.031
Thank you.

21:56.400 --> 21:59.312
Swan dive, cannonball, cherry bomb -

21:59.400 --> 22:02.676
no matter how he jumps,
the hyoid does not break.

22:02.760 --> 22:04.910
What about added weight?

22:05.000 --> 22:08.595
We figure an added strain of 90 kilos
to snap the hyoid.

22:08.680 --> 22:12.070
90 kilos is just under 200 pounds.
The weight of a muscular man.

22:12.160 --> 22:15.277
The Venezuelan hit-squad thing?
For one thing, it's nuts.

22:15.360 --> 22:18.875
And another,
the guy would have to be about 20 feet tall.

22:18.960 --> 22:24.159
I'm out of alternative scenarios
to explain this hyoid break.

22:32.760 --> 22:37.197
<i>- I want to take a look at his room.
- What exactly do you hope to find?</i>

22:40.480 --> 22:43.597
- Stay here.
- Yeah, right. That's gonna happen.

22:58.880 --> 23:01.474
- You all right?
- Are you?

23:03.560 --> 23:05.755
Check his ID.

23:07.640 --> 23:13.237
His name's Tovar Comara.
He's security at the Venezuelan embassy.

23:13.320 --> 23:16.278
If he's security, why'd he run?

23:22.640 --> 23:25.950
We would like know what SeÃ±or Comara
was doing in Nestor's room.

23:26.040 --> 23:30.033
I asked SeÃ±or Comara
to go to Nestor's room to prove a point.

23:30.120 --> 23:34.477
- That suicide was not the only possibility.
- Proof that an outsider can get in.

23:34.560 --> 23:39.315
The schooI informed me that his death was a
suicide, that anything else was impossible.

23:39.400 --> 23:44.190
We proved them correct.
I failed to escape without being detected.

23:44.280 --> 23:45.713
The schooI lied.

23:45.800 --> 23:50.078
Dr Brennan already declared
your son's death a homicide.

23:50.160 --> 23:53.709
- I apologise. I was misinformed.
- I won't be pressing any charges.

23:53.800 --> 23:55.597
<i>Thank you.</i>

23:56.760 --> 23:59.433
Please excuse me.

24:03.880 --> 24:06.599
<i>Tenemos otra diligencia en media hora.</i>

24:06.680 --> 24:10.958
- Do you think he was killed by outsiders?
- Not Venezuelan insurgents.

24:11.040 --> 24:16.114
They would make a statement,
not fake a suicide. This hanging...

24:17.360 --> 24:19.874
<i>- Huele mala.
- Hm.</i>

24:24.800 --> 24:28.475
Sure, you know, someone says
"it smells" in a Spanish accent

24:28.560 --> 24:32.633
and all of a sudden you're like,
"Hm. Interesting. "

24:32.720 --> 24:37.032
<i>- What are we looking for?
- I talked to Nestor's teachers, a few students.</i>

24:37.120 --> 24:38.997
He was a loner.

24:39.080 --> 24:44.518
Well, I mean, he went to his classes, but, you
know, mainly he just stayed here in his room.

24:44.600 --> 24:50.630
That's it. So I figured we'd come here and
you'd do your little anthropologist thing.

24:50.720 --> 24:52.711
OK.

24:56.200 --> 25:00.591
He liked music. Heavy percussion,
low frequencies for the most part.

25:00.680 --> 25:03.353
The stuff he probably liked
before the implant.

25:03.440 --> 25:05.829
He could feeI the vibrations in his chest.

25:05.920 --> 25:09.833
After the implant,
he started enjoying stuff with more melody.

25:09.920 --> 25:13.435
He was growing. He enjoyed it.

25:13.520 --> 25:17.957
- Enjoyment is the opposite of suicide.
- You've decided this isn't a suicide.

25:18.040 --> 25:21.999
You're collecting evidence to support that
and missing indicators.

25:22.080 --> 25:28.076
So why'd he throw this away? It's flute music.
That's reason enough, but where's the case?

25:35.680 --> 25:38.638
- These aren't organised.
- Well, girls organise.

25:38.720 --> 25:44.352
<i>Guys are more organic, you know?
Good stuff up to the left, crap...</i>

25:44.440 --> 25:46.431
bottom right.

25:47.880 --> 25:50.110
Look at that.

25:52.400 --> 25:56.234
I mean, if he hated it, why'd he reburn it?

25:57.840 --> 25:59.751
This isn't a CD.

25:59.840 --> 26:01.831
It's a DVD.

26:02.960 --> 26:05.793
I should've known.
It's a 15-year-old boy. It's porn.

26:05.880 --> 26:07.996
Wait.

26:13.120 --> 26:16.112
- That's our hanging victim.
- This is pretty kinky stuff.

26:16.200 --> 26:20.113
I need to know where and when it was shot,
anything else that might help.

26:20.200 --> 26:23.476
<i>I need stills and a
close-up of the girI's face.</i>

26:23.560 --> 26:26.677
Thanks, Booth.
My seven-organ soup is repeating on me.

26:26.760 --> 26:29.399
Well, you ordered.
You should've left it to Sid.

26:29.480 --> 26:32.313
Let's see what the schooI
has to say about this.

26:32.400 --> 26:37.793
That was not wild and kinky sex.
It was very, very basic beginner stuff.

26:37.880 --> 26:40.838
Just so you know.

26:40.920 --> 26:44.435
<i>Angela, you got any bicarbonate?</i>

26:48.160 --> 26:51.835
<i>- We've seen this kind of thing.
- Kids recording themselves?</i>

26:51.920 --> 26:55.674
Young people are more jaded
than they used to be. They swap these tapes.

26:55.760 --> 26:58.718
- Surprised to see Nestor.
- But not to see the girI?

26:58.800 --> 27:01.792
- How is that relevant?
- You know a better question?

27:01.880 --> 27:06.635
Why do you think you get to decide what's
relevant? You're a principaI of a high schooI.

27:06.720 --> 27:10.554
- We need all the sex tapes you confiscated.
- Absolutely not.

27:10.640 --> 27:13.950
I'll just get a warrant,
and in the application for a warrant,

27:14.040 --> 27:17.669
I'll include your admission
that you let students swap sex tapes.

27:17.760 --> 27:20.274
He's not refusing
to provide you with the tapes.

27:20.360 --> 27:22.749
"Absolutely not" sounds like a refusaI.

27:22.840 --> 27:26.879
When we confiscate the tapes,
we turn them over to locaI law enforcement.

27:26.960 --> 27:30.953
- Sheriff Roach knew about this?
- No need for a warrant. We're cooperating.

27:31.040 --> 27:35.830
- Was the girl also a student here?
- It's time we bring in a lawyer to advise us.

27:35.920 --> 27:38.912
Or you take my advice.
If you don't answer my questions,

27:39.000 --> 27:42.993
I'll take you down
to FBI headquarters in handcuffs.

27:43.080 --> 27:45.753
He'll do it. He doesn't like you.

27:49.520 --> 27:51.511
<i>Her name is Camden Destry.</i>

27:51.600 --> 27:54.478
<i>Nestor Olivos? I knew him.</i>

27:54.560 --> 27:56.596
<i>He's kinda famous since he died.</i>

27:56.680 --> 27:59.478
<i>Poor kid. To take his own life.</i>

28:00.480 --> 28:03.438
<i>- Were you romantically involved?
- No.</i>

28:03.520 --> 28:05.988
Camden is too young to date seriously.

28:09.880 --> 28:14.749
Tell me when you've seen enough
to start telling the truth.

28:15.760 --> 28:21.312
<i>- This is outrageous, Agent Booth.
- Oh, my God. I can't believe this.</i>

28:23.320 --> 28:26.790
- Oh, my God! Where did that come from?
- Mr Booth, I must protest.

28:26.880 --> 28:31.749
I'm tired of being lied to
so excuse me if I'm indelicate.

28:32.440 --> 28:34.670
Let's start over, shall we?

28:34.760 --> 28:37.877
Did you know Nestor Olivos?

28:37.960 --> 28:40.394
Were you romantically involved?

28:40.480 --> 28:43.677
Why would he do that?
Why would Nestor tape us?

28:43.760 --> 28:45.830
I loved him.

28:55.120 --> 28:58.078
<i>So let me get this right.
I'm tactless and insensitive?</i>

28:58.160 --> 29:02.233
She lied to a federaI agent in the
investigation of the death of a boy she loves.

29:02.320 --> 29:04.356
You know what? These kids all lie.

29:04.440 --> 29:08.319
That schooI teaches them that they're
above the rest of us. They're not.

29:08.400 --> 29:11.392
- You're the least objective person I've met.
- Thanks.

29:11.480 --> 29:14.153
- It's not a compliment.
- Something's wrong.

29:14.240 --> 29:16.276
The schooI, the tapes, Sheriff Roach.

29:16.360 --> 29:21.036
This mess you're uncovering, it smells, but
it doesn't add up to murder, not logically.

29:21.120 --> 29:26.069
- Maybe If you looked for more than facts...
- If you opened your mind, we'd find the truth.

29:26.160 --> 29:29.357
- Brought you the tapes.
- How many?

29:29.440 --> 29:32.193
All of them.
Do you think I'm withholding evidence?

29:32.280 --> 29:36.273
Hanover Prep gets you elected, you look
the other way when you see these tapes.

29:36.360 --> 29:38.635
Kids having sex? There's no law against it.

29:38.720 --> 29:42.076
Let's hope that's the
worst thing that we find.

29:49.080 --> 29:53.073
You're right
about the schooI serving pudding.

29:53.160 --> 29:56.152
"Stirring the pudding. " It means...

29:56.240 --> 30:00.392
Melodee Destry.
That's... that's Camden's mother.

30:00.480 --> 30:03.199
Is that... is that Nestor Olivos she's with?

30:03.880 --> 30:05.916
No.

30:06.000 --> 30:09.549
That's Nestor's roommate, Tucker Pattison.

30:17.600 --> 30:20.512
- How long was the relationship?
- Couple of months.

30:20.600 --> 30:23.797
- Tucker is the victim of statutory rape.
- When did it end?

30:23.880 --> 30:26.678
- That was the last time.
- Why Nestor's bed?

30:26.760 --> 30:29.672
- I don't know.
- Because you knew where the camera was.

30:29.760 --> 30:32.638
Mrs Destry gave me money, you know?
To keep quiet.

30:32.720 --> 30:36.235
Nestor said, "How much would she pay
to stop her husband seeing a tape?"

30:36.320 --> 30:38.834
Nestor set up a drop and got $5,000.

30:38.920 --> 30:42.754
He said we should do it again,
but I told him I was gonna tell my parents.

30:42.840 --> 30:49.313
Even if it meant getting kicked out of
Hanover. Next thing I know, he killed himself.

30:50.000 --> 30:52.594
I figured it was my fault.

30:56.240 --> 31:00.950
<i>Tabanid pupaI casings show
the boy ingested a heavy dose of ketamine.</i>

31:01.040 --> 31:03.759
Somebody dosed him?
That's why he didn't struggle.

31:03.840 --> 31:07.469
Or - a wild thought - he took it
himself for fun like most kids do.

31:07.560 --> 31:09.676
I had sex with Naomi in Palaeontology.

31:09.760 --> 31:12.513
- Actually in Palaeontology?
- No, at her place.

31:12.600 --> 31:17.151
I thought it went great, but I could be wrong.
Apparently what I think is kinky is basic.

31:17.240 --> 31:21.552
Since she never called me, I wonder if
it's because I lack imagination in the sack.

31:21.640 --> 31:25.110
You know what? I think
this is more of a guy-guy conversation.

31:25.200 --> 31:27.509
Yeah. I was wondering.

31:29.360 --> 31:31.510
Dude, minty burp is still burp.

31:31.600 --> 31:33.909
Well, who took me to Wong Salmonella's?

31:34.000 --> 31:36.798
You know what? Just go back to Sid.

31:36.880 --> 31:40.031
Let him bring you your meaI.
The heartburn will disappear.

31:40.120 --> 31:42.350
- Heartburn.
- What?

31:42.440 --> 31:45.989
Hodgins has heartburn because acid
is rising into his oesophagus.

31:46.080 --> 31:48.833
The ketamine
could've made Nestor regurgitate.

31:48.920 --> 31:53.038
The rope would hold gastric juices
in the upper throat and weaken the hyoid.

31:53.120 --> 31:55.554
Digestive juices are hydrochloric acid.

31:55.640 --> 31:59.758
When you're not busy, could I ask you
a few questions about sexuaI positions?

31:59.840 --> 32:03.196
If you even try, I will take my gun
and shoot you between the eyes.

32:03.280 --> 32:06.716
These marks here,
that's consistent with hydrochloric acid.

32:06.800 --> 32:09.837
- I don't like this.
- I'll run it through the Angelator.

32:09.920 --> 32:13.799
Replace the values for the hyoid bone mass
with these coefficients.

32:13.880 --> 32:18.954
That will replicate bone deterioration as
the hyoid is being digested by stomach acid.

32:19.040 --> 32:23.079
<i>I'm applying a timeline
and running in fast forward.</i>

32:23.160 --> 32:27.597
<i>The gastric juices trapped
by the noose in Nestor's oesophagus</i>

32:27.680 --> 32:30.478
actually digest the hyoid over time.

32:30.560 --> 32:33.199
Wait. There. The hyoid cracked.

32:33.280 --> 32:35.271
196.3 hours.

32:35.360 --> 32:37.430
Just over eight days.

32:38.000 --> 32:41.356
- This finding is congruent with suicide.
- I do not accept that.

32:41.440 --> 32:45.877
It's a fact. You can't not accept a fact.
I have to amend my cause-of-death report.

32:45.960 --> 32:51.671
You'll stop my investigation. The schooI's
covering up a murder. You're helping them.

33:01.480 --> 33:03.869
<i>Honey.</i>

33:05.160 --> 33:09.358
Did you everjust believe something
despite the evidence?

33:09.440 --> 33:11.795
Just know it was true?

33:12.800 --> 33:15.917
No. I've hoped things.

33:16.000 --> 33:20.755
But I've always known the difference
between hope and fact.

33:20.840 --> 33:24.071
You know, all that's left of this boy
is a table full of bones.

33:24.160 --> 33:26.355
Everyone he's ever known has an agenda.

33:26.440 --> 33:29.716
His parents, schooI,
even the cop investigating his death.

33:29.800 --> 33:35.272
I'm the only one who cares about the truth
of what Nestor's life came to, good or bad.

33:35.360 --> 33:38.636
And I know the truth is more important
than anything else.

33:38.720 --> 33:42.759
You know... or you hope it's true?

33:45.320 --> 33:49.393
Suicide is the most rationaI,
logicaI explanation.

33:49.480 --> 33:53.917
What I believe doesn't matter.
What makes me sad doesn't matter.

33:57.720 --> 34:00.280
Look at this face.

34:00.360 --> 34:03.352
He did not kill himself.

34:03.440 --> 34:07.956
Angela, I need a little more proof
than a nice drawing.

34:08.600 --> 34:10.989
I can do that.

34:22.600 --> 34:26.752
OK, this is not from the DVD. It's a quick
snippet that was on Nestor's hard drive.

34:26.840 --> 34:31.789
Somebody tried to erase it,
but Zack and I got some of it back.

34:36.679 --> 34:39.717
Angela, zoom in on that necklace.

34:41.199 --> 34:45.795
A little sea horse? Come on.
What kind of blackmailer does that?

34:45.880 --> 34:48.518
It's sweet. It's a clueless kid in love.

34:48.600 --> 34:51.512
That's evidence he didn't commit suicide?
A sea horse?

34:51.600 --> 34:54.034
A kid doesn't give a gift cos he's in love.

34:54.120 --> 34:58.079
- He does it cos he wants a little loving.
- Rerun that.

34:58.160 --> 35:02.153
That cynicism you affect, Booth,
it's your way of hiding a romantic nature.

35:02.240 --> 35:04.959
There. Stop. Play again.

35:06.840 --> 35:08.796
- There. She rolled her eyes.
- What?

35:08.880 --> 35:12.634
- No. I didn't see it either.
- Play it in stop motion.

35:12.720 --> 35:15.757
Zoom in. There.

35:15.840 --> 35:17.831
Slow motion.

35:23.880 --> 35:27.236
- How'd you see that?
- Wait. That girI knew the camera was there.

35:27.320 --> 35:30.198
- She looked at it.
- She isn't a victim. She's in on it.

35:30.280 --> 35:33.909
You don't roll your eyes to yourself.
You do that for someone else.

35:34.000 --> 35:38.278
- What do we do now?
- Now a public-schooI education comes in.

35:38.360 --> 35:40.999
"Divide and conquer"
was the playground motto.

35:41.520 --> 35:44.432
What would help
is if you told me why he killed himself.

35:44.520 --> 35:47.512
<i>Then we can close
the murder investigation.</i>

35:47.600 --> 35:51.115
- Why is Tucker here?
- Oh, Tucker, he said some things.

35:51.200 --> 35:54.351
- What things?
- What he said doesn't make you look good.

35:54.440 --> 35:57.989
I believe him. Agent Booth says
it was only fair to hear your side.

35:58.080 --> 36:03.871
If your stories match up, I'll be
able to drop the murder investigation.

36:03.960 --> 36:08.192
I find it hard to believe that it was
your idea for Tucker to seduce your mother.

36:08.280 --> 36:12.193
- It wasn't. She hit on Tucker.
- No, wait, wait. Can they do this?

36:12.280 --> 36:15.033
- They're fishing. Don't say a word.
- I wasn't fishing.

36:15.120 --> 36:20.399
Tucker was all "Stacy's Mom" about it.
I just sort of gave him permission.

36:20.480 --> 36:22.357
- It was funny.
- Please stop this.

36:22.440 --> 36:27.275
Mom, deaI with it, OK?
You're the one that's the perv, so...

36:28.400 --> 36:33.030
When my mom gave Tucker money to keep
him quiet, we got the idea to blackmaiI her.

36:33.120 --> 36:37.318
I was mad at her, I guess.
Then Tucker said it was my turn.

36:37.400 --> 36:40.756
Nestor was rich, lonely, Catholic,
and he had a thing for you.

36:40.840 --> 36:46.790
He was cute. People didn't notice because
of the way he talked, but he was really cute.

36:46.880 --> 36:49.792
I liked him.

36:49.880 --> 36:54.749
We made the tape and showed it to Nestor.
It made him really upset.

36:54.840 --> 36:56.990
Really upset.

36:57.080 --> 37:00.789
- Because you said you'd show his mother?
- Or because I broke his heart.

37:00.880 --> 37:04.873
I still can't believe he killed himself.
I'm really sorry he did that.

37:04.960 --> 37:07.713
What Camden did was wrong,
which she acknowledged.

37:07.800 --> 37:11.076
She isn't responsible
for an unstable boy's overreaction.

37:11.160 --> 37:12.798
I said I'm sorry.

37:12.880 --> 37:16.350
I'm placing you under arrest
for the murder of Nestor Olivos.

37:16.440 --> 37:19.557
What? She's admitted to
blackmaiI. That's all.

37:19.640 --> 37:21.676
He was going to go to the headmaster,

37:21.760 --> 37:25.958
so you dosed him with ketamine
and hauled him up into the tree.

37:26.040 --> 37:31.751
- The DNA traces in the rope will prove that.
- Plus you've already confessed to the motive.

37:31.840 --> 37:37.551
If I cooperate and tell you everything
Tucker did, do I get some sort of deaI?

37:39.200 --> 37:41.998
That depends on what else you got.

37:44.800 --> 37:50.397
The headmaster and the head of security will
both lose theirjobs. The sheriff will resign.

37:50.480 --> 37:54.712
The two kids who killed your son
are both in custody.

37:54.800 --> 37:56.438
Thank you.

37:56.520 --> 38:00.069
We're very sorry for your loss.

38:04.120 --> 38:06.111
Ambassador Olivos.

38:09.240 --> 38:15.315
You told me that all a mother wants is
to know that she's raised her child well,

38:15.400 --> 38:20.520
that your biggest regret is you'll never know
if Nestor would've grown up to be a good man.

38:20.600 --> 38:22.750
But he was a good man.

38:23.880 --> 38:27.270
He died because
he was trying to do the right thing.

38:35.760 --> 38:38.513
Very impressive, Temperance.

38:38.600 --> 38:41.433
Got that one right.

38:51.200 --> 38:56.035
When you're with someone, the gymnastics
aren't what matter. It's who you are.

38:56.120 --> 39:01.148
- It's your intentions and how much you care.
- If you don't want to help me, just say so.

39:01.240 --> 39:07.554
All right. I'm gonna let you in on
a secret. This is a female secret.

39:07.640 --> 39:12.668
Go to Naomi and tell her that
you don't know anything about lovemaking.

39:12.760 --> 39:17.231
Sex, yeah. Lovemaking, you're a blank slate.

39:17.320 --> 39:21.996
You'll do anything she wants if she just
introduces you to the secrets of love.

39:22.080 --> 39:25.993
She'll be more interested
than if you were the most imaginative lover.

39:26.080 --> 39:29.675
- That is totally counterintuitive.
- Just do it, Z-man.

39:29.760 --> 39:33.036
Reap the benefits of my sexuaI wisdom.

39:36.400 --> 39:40.439
Oh, no. This isn't gonna work.
I mean, this is my place. Sid.

39:40.520 --> 39:45.036
As long as they keep it down on the subject
of corpses and bodily fluids, I have no beef.

39:45.120 --> 39:47.270
OK, that is amazing. I had heartburn.

39:47.360 --> 39:51.114
I asked Sid to bring me something
and now the heartburn's gone.

39:51.200 --> 39:55.113
<i>- Man, I love this place.
- OK, fine. New rules.</i>

39:55.200 --> 39:58.112
That counter is mine. That booth is yours.

39:58.200 --> 40:01.954
Everything else around here,
all right, mine. All right?

40:02.040 --> 40:05.316
Mine. M-i-n-e. Mine.

40:17.680 --> 40:21.275
I've been thinking about
your whole "something stinks" aptitude.

40:21.360 --> 40:23.590
Oh, yeah?

40:23.680 --> 40:26.752
I think you have a knack
for reading body language.

40:26.840 --> 40:31.277
Stress in the voice, other indicators.
It's not mysterious, but it is impressive.

40:31.360 --> 40:35.512
In the future, I will try to accord it
an appropriate degree of objective worth.

40:35.600 --> 40:38.239
Thank you, Temperance. I appreciate that.

40:38.320 --> 40:40.880
So...

40:40.960 --> 40:45.238
what part of "this is mine"
did you not understand?

40:48.440 --> 40:50.749
Want me to say it in Latin?

40:56.240 --> 40:58.231
<i>Absit invidia.</i>

41:12.360 --> 41:14.555
Nice.
