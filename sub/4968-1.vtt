01:08.200 --> 01:11.101
Valhalla, this is Thor.
Valhalla, this is Thor.

01:11.203 --> 01:14.639
We have visual on
a possible high-value target,

01:14.740 --> 01:16.173
Thor, this is Valhalla.

01:16.275 --> 01:19.767
We're seeking positive lD
on target traveling in convoy

01:19.878 --> 01:22.938
and we're pushing
more assets your way.

01:23.081 --> 01:26.209
Contact Loki on secondary net.

01:26.318 --> 01:28.252
Loki, this is Thor.

01:28.353 --> 01:32.483
Target is located at grid coordinates
two-four-Tango-Kilo-Bravo

01:32.591 --> 01:35.924
one-two-four-five-six-seven-three-niner,

01:36.028 --> 01:37.757
Confirm you have visual,

01:37.863 --> 01:39.228
Verifying target lD.

01:39.331 --> 01:41.356
Electro-optic and
infrared sensors are online.

01:41.466 --> 01:43.934
-Confirming target.
-SecDef is arriving now.

01:53.178 --> 01:55.476
Mr. Secretary, this way, sir.

01:59.952 --> 02:01.476
Attempting cell phone link
to moving target.

02:01.587 --> 02:03.452
Stand by for data feed.

02:06.291 --> 02:07.690
Stand by for audio.

02:07.793 --> 02:08.987
Got it.

02:10.628 --> 02:14.429
Now, don't tell me you spotted the beard
in the middle of a goddamn sandstorm.

02:14.533 --> 02:17.764
-ls it really him?
-We're confirming that now, sir.

02:17.869 --> 02:18.893
Sir, audio is coming up now.

02:19.004 --> 02:22.167
-Verifying voice pattern match.
-What do we have here, Sergeant?

02:23.075 --> 02:26.636
Four males. One of them is speaking
in a Rakhshani dialect,

02:26.745 --> 02:29.339
consistent with our intel on al-Khoei.

02:31.917 --> 02:33.680
Sir, it's just coming up.

02:33.785 --> 02:37.312
''Thirty-seven percent'' and ''probable''
don't belong in the same sentence.

02:37.422 --> 02:38.946
l'm not taking this to the President.

02:39.057 --> 02:42.117
ClA and NCTC concur it is the target,

02:42.227 --> 02:44.024
based on reliable intel from the Brits,

02:44.129 --> 02:46.427
They're pulling off the highway.

03:02.447 --> 03:04.039
Criteria is not met. Recommend abort.

03:04.149 --> 03:05.912
We have an abort recommendation.

03:06.018 --> 03:09.784
lf it's him, this guy comes out of hiding
every couple of years at best.

03:09.888 --> 03:12.322
Sir, target is appearing
around the northeast corner.

03:15.994 --> 03:19.361
We've got AK-47 s,
RPGs and Chaparral guided missiles.

03:19.464 --> 03:21.227
This is a training camp, Mr. Secretary.

03:21.333 --> 03:24.632
-Wait. Wait. Print. 51 %.
-51 %.

03:24.736 --> 03:27.603
-Abort rec still holds.
-All other PlD options exhausted.

03:27.706 --> 03:30.004
What do you suggest we do, sir?

03:32.144 --> 03:33.475
ls that a weapons cache?

03:33.578 --> 03:35.569
Sir, the placement of
the stones around the pit,

03:35.681 --> 03:39.242
marker for the five pillars of lslam.
l think it's a funeral.

03:39.351 --> 03:40.716
For Christ's sake.

03:40.819 --> 03:44.880
Counsel, how many ways would this
violate the Geneva Convention?

03:44.990 --> 03:46.924
We can invoke hors de combat,

03:47.025 --> 03:49.994
There's no independent intel verifying
that this is, in fact, a funeral.

03:50.095 --> 03:53.326
Signal's got the President
from Air Force One, sir.

04:01.840 --> 04:03.102
Mr. President,

04:03.208 --> 04:07.042
we have a 51 % identity match
on Majid al-Khoei.

04:07.145 --> 04:10.637
The bad news is, there's
some possibility he's at a funeral,

04:10.749 --> 04:14.412
You should also be aware
we have an abort recommendation.

04:14.519 --> 04:17.079
But the Joint Chiefs are urging a go.

04:17.889 --> 04:20.483
All right, what's your recommendation?

04:26.131 --> 04:30.591
Sir, we measure success by
the least amount of collateral damage.

04:31.336 --> 04:35.670
At 51 % probability, the risk is too high.

04:35.774 --> 04:41.440
And if it is al-Khoei and he walks,
l'm putting our people at risk,

04:42.447 --> 04:43.914
You have a go,

04:47.552 --> 04:49.679
Thank you, Mr. President.

04:54.559 --> 04:55.753
-We're weapons hot!
-We have weapons hot!

04:55.861 --> 04:58.261
-Loki, you are cleared to engage.
-Repeat, weapons hot. PlD.

04:58.363 --> 05:01.696
We have handshake with the
MQ9 Reaper. Sending you images now.

05:01.800 --> 05:05.201
-Loki, target coordinates received.
-Yes, sir. Switching to lR sensor.

05:14.279 --> 05:16.110
Target is lased.

05:18.016 --> 05:19.779
Master arm on.

05:19.885 --> 05:21.375
Missiles away.

05:25.590 --> 05:27.455
Ten seconds to impact.

05:49.981 --> 05:52.609
You got to make a choice, fellas.

05:52.784 --> 05:57.244
Who are you going to be? Boys or men?

06:00.659 --> 06:02.092
-l'm out on this one.
-Why?

06:02.194 --> 06:04.560
-'Cause l'm broke.
-Come...

06:04.663 --> 06:06.290
How do l know you don't have
something great under there?

06:06.398 --> 06:07.797
Kwame just paired the board.
l'm floating on the river here.

06:07.899 --> 06:08.991
Look at the table.

06:09.100 --> 06:11.967
l don't know. l'm supposed to take my
girl out later. lt's a lot of money.

06:12.070 --> 06:15.198
Your girl out? Who's that?

06:15.307 --> 06:16.797
-Elaine?
-Yeah.

06:16.908 --> 06:18.967
You guys have been going out
for a while.

06:19.077 --> 06:20.442
How long?

06:20.545 --> 06:22.809
-Couple months.
-Couple months? Wow.

06:22.914 --> 06:26.077
-That's big. You have sex with her yet?
-Kinda.

06:26.184 --> 06:27.515
-What the hell is ''kinda''?
-''Kinda''?

06:27.619 --> 06:28.847
-Personal question.
-Okay, well, listen.

06:28.954 --> 06:31.218
Let me ask you a question.
What are you going to do tonight?

06:31.323 --> 06:32.290
Fish filet and a Coke?

06:32.390 --> 06:34.017
Go to Blockbuster,
rent a little romantic comedy,

06:34.125 --> 06:35.786
go back to Mom's house,
sit on the couch?

06:35.894 --> 06:37.225
-How'd you know?
-Well, that's what you do.

06:37.329 --> 06:38.990
You're a dependable person.
That's what you're going to do.

06:39.097 --> 06:40.689
You know what you should do?

06:40.799 --> 06:43.097
You need to lay down some real green
and treat your lady right.

06:43.201 --> 06:45.066
You know, you need to take her
to a nice place.

06:45.170 --> 06:48.298
Red Lobster. Olive Garden.
Tablecloths. Soft music.

06:48.406 --> 06:50.374
And then you skip
this Blockbuster thing.

06:50.475 --> 06:53.467
Girls want to go out. Especially a girl
as cute as your girl, you know?

06:53.578 --> 06:55.569
She wants to be seen.
That's why she dresses up.

06:55.680 --> 06:57.204
So you take her to the movies.

06:57.315 --> 06:58.839
-A little popcorn-drink combo.
-True. True.

06:58.950 --> 07:01.942
Elaine might want a hot dog and some
nachos, so you shell out for that, too.

07:02.053 --> 07:03.452
And then before you know it,

07:03.555 --> 07:04.749
she's cozying up
the way she never would've

07:04.856 --> 07:05.948
at her mom's house, you know?

07:06.057 --> 07:07.456
-Preach it. Preach it.
-Now all of a sudden, look.

07:07.559 --> 07:09.925
Gino Romero's walking tall
with Elaine yank-my-Dickinson,

07:10.028 --> 07:11.928
-all because he dared to dream tonight.
-Yes! Yes! Yes!

07:12.030 --> 07:13.224
And he became a man.
And that's the choice.

07:13.331 --> 07:14.855
-Yes.
-And that's what's on the table.

07:14.966 --> 07:17.366
This is the dream right here.

07:17.469 --> 07:18.834
Are you a man?

07:18.937 --> 07:20.097
-l'm with you.
-Okay, here we go.

07:20.205 --> 07:21.467
-l'm with you. Twenty?
-Twenty.

07:21.573 --> 07:23.006
Big boy game.

07:23.775 --> 07:24.676
Call.

07:25.377 --> 07:27.538
-Cowboys over aces, big Jer.
-Wow. Wow.

07:27.646 --> 07:29.136
-Didn't see that coming, huh?
-Yeah, that's a tough one.

07:29.247 --> 07:31.340
This is a tough one, too.
Four bullets, baby.

07:31.449 --> 07:34.145
Get out of here!
You baited me into that, Jer. Come on!

07:34.252 --> 07:36.243
-That's the way it goes.
-So what happened to Red Lobster?

07:36.354 --> 07:37.946
No, l guess it's Mama's house
for you tonight.

07:38.056 --> 07:39.284
But look, l saved you 40 bucks.

07:39.391 --> 07:42.849
And now Elaine won't have to shell out
for herpes medication.

07:42.961 --> 07:45.293
Break's over, bitches.
Freitag missed his shift again.

07:45.397 --> 07:46.557
-Someone's on collator duty.
-Great.

07:46.665 --> 07:48.530
All right, well, gentlemen,

07:48.633 --> 07:51.466
l'll give you a chance to win some of
this back tomorrow. Enjoy yourselves.

07:51.569 --> 07:53.059
All right, man.

07:58.443 --> 08:01.037
Hey there. Welcome to Copy Cabana.
How can l help you?

08:01.146 --> 08:03.307
l couldn't get the machine
past the main menu.

08:03.415 --> 08:05.042
-That machine there?
-Yeah.

08:05.150 --> 08:07.118
Did you swipe your credit card
to the left, sir?

08:07.218 --> 08:08.981
-Didn't do that.
-Well, that's your problem.

08:09.087 --> 08:10.076
Why don't you try it again?

08:20.665 --> 08:22.656
Cell phone users, beware,

08:22.767 --> 08:26.965
The Federal Bureau of lnvestigation
can now hear everything you're saying,

08:27.072 --> 08:29.233
even when your cell phone is turned off,

08:29.341 --> 08:32.868
Authorities can now activate
the microphone inside your phone,

08:32.977 --> 08:35.811
allowing them to eavesdrop
on you and your conversations,

08:35.914 --> 08:41.044
Experts say the only way around this
is to take the battery out of the device,

08:42.053 --> 08:44.453
-The death toll now stands at 1 4,
-Now arriving at Union Street,

08:44.556 --> 08:45.545
-Stand clear of the doors,
-Excuse me.

08:45.657 --> 08:47.591
Watch your step, please,

08:49.661 --> 08:51.253
Did you drop this?

08:53.164 --> 08:54.188
Yes.

08:55.066 --> 08:58.502
-lt's hard to do on a train, you know!
-Doors closing,

08:58.603 --> 09:00.434
Standing passengers,,,

09:01.706 --> 09:03.105
Come on, come on, come on.

09:46.918 --> 09:48.044
Jerry?

09:48.720 --> 09:51.985
Mrs. Wierzbowski! l was just...
l thought you might have been sleeping.

09:52.090 --> 09:53.489
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.
-So... But l have...

09:53.591 --> 09:55.422

09:55.527 --> 09:57.654
-Here you go.
-Yeah, some is good. All is better.

09:57.762 --> 09:59.627
Well, that's most of it. Here.

09:59.731 --> 10:01.028
$1 , $1 , $1 ...

10:01.132 --> 10:02.690
No, no, no. Look. Here's a five there.

10:02.801 --> 10:04.962
-Five.
-Yeah.

10:05.070 --> 10:07.061
Where is girl? l don't see her no more.

10:07.172 --> 10:09.402
You know you're the only woman for me.

10:09.507 --> 10:11.304
No, that's done. She got smart.

10:11.409 --> 10:13.309
-Like the others.
-Yeah. Yeah.

10:14.045 --> 10:18.038
ls woman friend? Answer.
Then see if she give you money for rent.

10:19.451 --> 10:20.816
One second.

10:23.188 --> 10:24.416
Hey, Mom.

10:27.325 --> 10:28.417
What?

10:55.787 --> 10:58.221
-Looks just like him.
-l'm not him.

12:38.122 --> 12:40.886
Six months without a boo or a bah, huh?

12:40.992 --> 12:42.550
Yes, sir.

12:42.660 --> 12:44.787
So where were you this time?

12:46.264 --> 12:50.633
Alaska. Singapore.
l got a job there.

12:53.671 --> 12:57.801
l... l spoke to Stanford.

12:57.909 --> 12:58.876
l pulled some strings.

12:58.977 --> 13:00.774
They said they'd take you back.
Even though you took off...

13:00.878 --> 13:02.072
Two years ago, Dad.

13:02.180 --> 13:05.843
Jerry, you know, it wouldn't kill you
to ask for help once in a while.

13:05.950 --> 13:07.178
You want to have
this conversation now?

13:07.285 --> 13:08.445
-lt's Stanford!
-You want to do this today.

13:08.553 --> 13:09.520
You know how many people would kill...

13:09.621 --> 13:11.782
-Today? You want to have this now?
-Fine.

13:11.889 --> 13:15.120
You do whatever you want.
You always have.

13:22.300 --> 13:25.997
You know, l keep thinking,
l'm going to walk in here one day

13:26.771 --> 13:30.673
and l'm not going to feel
like a stranger in my own house.

13:41.953 --> 13:43.887
l don't want your money.

14:11.382 --> 14:13.976
Can l have your attention, please?

14:14.085 --> 14:18.419
Smoking is not permitted on the train,
Chicago is next,

14:38.109 --> 14:40.976
Can't find the keys
and he's late as usual.

14:41.079 --> 14:44.105
-l'm going to have to take you.
-He'll be here.

14:45.016 --> 14:47.007
All right, wait five more minutes.

14:47.118 --> 14:49.143
Help me out here.
We came home last night.

14:49.253 --> 14:52.086
l put the leftovers down.
You turned on the TV. l went over,

14:52.190 --> 14:55.819
said, ''No TV, no TV, no TV.''
Turned it off.

14:55.927 --> 14:57.019
Came over here.

14:57.128 --> 14:59.096
-Checked the messages.
-Knocked over the phone.

14:59.197 --> 15:01.597
Right, knocked over the phone.
Put it back.

15:01.699 --> 15:04.031
Put the leftovers in the fridge.

15:07.939 --> 15:08.928
Let's go!

15:09.073 --> 15:11.303
l put vitamins in your toiletry bag.
Don't forget to take...

15:11.409 --> 15:13.070
-Two in the morning and two at night.
-That's right.

15:13.177 --> 15:14.166
And your inhaler's
in the back of your bag.

15:14.278 --> 15:15.336
-Sammy!
-Daddy!

15:15.446 --> 15:18.006
Come here. You didn't think
l'd miss the big send-off, do you, huh?

15:18.116 --> 15:19.378
Let's get you on this train.

15:19.484 --> 15:21.145
-This must be your...
-Trumpet.

15:21.252 --> 15:23.186
My God, this weighs, like, 200 pounds.
You carry this yourself?

15:23.287 --> 15:24.982
-Mr. and Mrs. Holloman!
-Miss.

15:25.089 --> 15:26.681
-You just made it.
-Right.

15:26.791 --> 15:28.258
-Here, Sam.
-Thanks.

15:28.359 --> 15:29.348
-Listen to me.
-l have one more here.

15:29.460 --> 15:32.258
All these other kids, right? They're
going to call their moms, too, all right?

15:32.363 --> 15:33.990
They're just going to lie about it.

15:34.098 --> 15:36.999
All right, and eat junk food 'cause this is
your one chance, but brush your teeth.

15:37.101 --> 15:40.332
Mom, you got to stop.
l'm going to miss you, too.

15:40.438 --> 15:42.030
Capitol Limited to D,C, is
departing now,

15:42.140 --> 15:43.232
Give me a hug.

15:43.341 --> 15:44.330
All aboard,

15:44.442 --> 15:46.410
-l love you so much.
-l love you, too.

15:48.045 --> 15:50.036
-Shine bright, okay?
-Okay.

15:51.315 --> 15:53.146
Rock the house, buddy.
You're going to be great. Okay?

15:53.251 --> 15:54.513
-Okay.
-l'll see you later.

15:54.619 --> 15:57.247
-Bye!
-Have fun in D.C.!

15:57.355 --> 16:00.017
-Bye, Mom!
-Your mom going to be okay?

16:00.124 --> 16:01.557
lt's unclear.

16:02.727 --> 16:03.785
l'm so sorry. l got stuck in traffic,

16:03.895 --> 16:06.022
-and l didn't even...
-Don't even say it.

16:08.332 --> 16:09.697
All aboard!

16:10.101 --> 16:12.069
Yes. Five-nine-one-three.

16:18.376 --> 16:20.139
lt's here. lt's here.

16:22.513 --> 16:23.844
Okay, okay.

16:40.131 --> 16:42.326
-Come on!
-Two seconds. Sorry.

16:49.941 --> 16:51.169
No, wait.

17:00.351 --> 17:01.818
-Hey, hang on a second.
-Sorry.

17:01.919 --> 17:03.147
-You're dropping money.
-Sir, sir!

17:03.254 --> 17:05.983
Big date, you know?
Fingers crossed, huh?

17:09.527 --> 17:11.290
-Here you go. Have a good day!
-Thank you.

17:14.765 --> 17:15.789
-Jerry!
-What?

17:15.900 --> 17:17.765
-So many boxes.
-Boxes?

17:17.868 --> 17:20.337
l had to open your room.
All day they come.

17:20.438 --> 17:21.837
-Big boxes, small boxes.
-My boxes?

17:21.939 --> 17:23.304
l don't know.
Whose boxes would they be?

17:23.406 --> 17:25.739
-All right, okay.
-Look at them there. See in there?

17:25.843 --> 17:27.208
-See, l put them all...
-Yeah. Yeah.

17:27.310 --> 17:29.074
-Listen, l have something for you here.
-Yeah.

17:29.180 --> 17:31.239
This is rent for this month
and next month, too, okay?

17:31.349 --> 17:33.044
-Oh, my.
-Thank you.

18:46.691 --> 18:47.658
Hello?

18:47.758 --> 18:50.352
The FBl will arrive
at your apartment in 30 seconds,

18:50.461 --> 18:52.053
You must flee the premises,

18:52.163 --> 18:53.323
Who... Who is this?

18:53.431 --> 18:54.955
You've been activated, Jerry,

18:55.066 --> 18:56.897
-Who the hell is this?
-Your compliance is vital,

18:57.001 --> 18:57.968
How did you get this number?

18:58.069 --> 19:00.970
You now have 24 seconds,
Leave your residence,

19:01.072 --> 19:04.633
Your destination, the Mathis train
station, We will guide you from there,

19:04.742 --> 19:05.766
What is this?

19:05.876 --> 19:08.037
The evidence in your
apartment is irrefutable,

19:08.145 --> 19:09.134
-Listen.
-1 7 seconds,

19:09.246 --> 19:10.213
l'm going to hang this phone up now.

19:10.314 --> 19:11.542
They'll seek your arrest
for conspiracy, treason,,,

19:11.649 --> 19:13.674
-l'm hanging this phone up now!
-,,,violating state and local law,

19:13.784 --> 19:15.615
-You tell me how you got this number!
-Maximum penalty, death,

19:15.720 --> 19:17.711
No, none of this is mine!

19:19.824 --> 19:23.123
FBl, FBl, FBl! Get down on the floor!

19:23.227 --> 19:24.888
Get on the ground!

19:26.530 --> 19:27.792
Down now! Get down!

19:27.898 --> 19:30.196
-l didn't do anything!
-Get down!

19:30.301 --> 19:31.461
-Listen!
-Don't move.

19:31.569 --> 19:33.935
lt's not mine! lt's not mine!

19:45.149 --> 19:47.379
This is obviously
some sort of mistake, right?

19:47.485 --> 19:50.386
l mean, l don't know
what l'm doing in this room, sir.

19:50.488 --> 19:52.513
lt's cold as hell outside.

19:54.158 --> 19:56.922
-You draw?
-l what?

19:57.028 --> 20:00.589
Do you draw? Do you sketch?
You have ink all over your fingers.

20:02.833 --> 20:04.391
Look, you know you got
the wrong guy, right?

20:04.502 --> 20:05.833
l mean,
this is all some kind of sick joke.

20:05.936 --> 20:08.131
-l don't know what l'm doing here.
-Obviously.

20:08.239 --> 20:11.265
Obviously you have
nothing to do with it, yeah.

20:11.909 --> 20:13.934
Did you love your brother?

20:15.279 --> 20:17.941
Or did you hate him?
Did you admire him?

20:19.884 --> 20:22.682
Was your brother patriotic,
would you say?

20:25.856 --> 20:28.222
When's the last time you saw him?

20:29.960 --> 20:32.258
-Christmas.
-This past Christmas?

20:33.698 --> 20:36.758
-Three Christmases ago.
-Three years, huh?

20:36.867 --> 20:40.462
Well, the phone records show that you
haven't even called him in over a year.

20:40.571 --> 20:43.335
So no text messages?
No smoke signals?

20:43.441 --> 20:44.908
No MySpace or Facebook messages?

20:45.009 --> 20:46.533
Yeah, so what are you trying to say?
We're not...

20:46.644 --> 20:47.770
Are you asking if we're the type of twins

20:47.878 --> 20:52.372
that wear the same shirt to the mall,
hold hands, and things like that? No.

20:52.817 --> 20:55.513
-Sir, l don't even know your name.
-l'm sorry, that was rude of me.

20:55.619 --> 20:56.779
l'm Tom Morgan,

20:56.887 --> 21:00.345
the Supervising Agent assigned
to the Joint Terrorism Task Force.

21:02.827 --> 21:05.125
You think l'm a terrorist?

21:05.863 --> 21:07.387
No, you're a copy boy, aren't you?

21:07.498 --> 21:10.092
-l'm a copy associate.
-Copy associate.

21:10.835 --> 21:12.166
But your brother,

21:12.269 --> 21:16.467
it says here he was a little more,
l guess you'd say, ambitious than you.

21:16.574 --> 21:18.667
Graduated from
the Air Force Academy at 21 ,

21:18.776 --> 21:22.405
with an advanced degree in parallel
algorithms and quantum electronics.

21:22.513 --> 21:24.743
l don't even know what the hell
that stuff means. Do you?

21:24.849 --> 21:27.340
Cadet wing commander, valedictorian,
plum job in the Public Affairs...

21:27.451 --> 21:29.112
Yeah, no, l know what he did, sir.

21:29.220 --> 21:30.687
Why'd you drop out of school, Jerry?

21:30.788 --> 21:33.154
Did your brother have
any influence on that decision?

21:33.257 --> 21:34.588
No, school just wasn't for me.

21:34.692 --> 21:37.160
No, l mean, who would want
a Stanford education anyway?

21:37.261 --> 21:40.230
More upward mobility
at Copy Cabana, l guess, right?

21:40.331 --> 21:44.427
l see you did a little backpacking.
Singapore, Bali, lndonesia.

21:44.535 --> 21:45.832
Did odd jobs here and there.
So you've been around.

21:45.936 --> 21:46.994
Look, none of this has anything to do

21:47.104 --> 21:49.231
with any of the shit
that was in my apartment.

21:49.340 --> 21:51.433
Why would l send it to myself?
My name is on the lease.

21:51.542 --> 21:53.669
l'd have to be the dumbest terrorist
in the history of the world.

21:53.778 --> 21:55.211
So who deposited the 750?

21:55.312 --> 21:58.577
The...
l don't know who deposited the 750!

21:58.682 --> 22:00.013
God maybe? l thought it was a miracle,

22:00.117 --> 22:02.278
l took the money. That was my mistake.
lt was an accident.

22:02.386 --> 22:04.149
Do accidents not happen
in your universe?

22:04.255 --> 22:08.191
Well, the money originated
from the YTBC Bank of...

22:08.292 --> 22:10.260
Well, l'll be darned, Singapore.

22:10.361 --> 22:13.194
Opened with a transfer from
a corporation called The Star of Orion,

22:13.297 --> 22:15.527
-a dummy front for Hezbollah.
-This is all very interesting, sir.

22:15.633 --> 22:18.659
-lt has nothing to do with me.
-We find hardware in your apartment.

22:18.769 --> 22:20.634
Latest military spec.

22:20.738 --> 22:21.966
-Airplane manuals.
-l told you about this already.

22:22.072 --> 22:24.734
And 1 ,200 pounds
of ammonium nitrate fertilizer.

22:24.842 --> 22:25.831
l walked into my apartment...

22:25.943 --> 22:27.604
You planning on becoming
a farmer or something?

22:27.711 --> 22:30.077
l walk into my apartment,
l open the door,

22:30.181 --> 22:31.375
and this shit's all over my apartment.

22:31.482 --> 22:32.881
-lt just showed up.
-lt just showed up.

22:32.983 --> 22:35.850
l see. l'm just curious
if your brother knew anything about it.

22:35.953 --> 22:40.049
Of course, we haven't really established
how close you guys were yet, have we?

22:40.157 --> 22:42.955
Well, we were pretty close this morning
when l buried his body in the ground.

22:43.828 --> 22:45.625
Does that establish anything for you?
Somebody set me up.

22:45.729 --> 22:47.026
Why is that so hard
for you to understand?

22:47.131 --> 22:48.598
-''Somebody.''
-A woman called me on the phone.

22:48.699 --> 22:49.791
She told me l was going to be arrested.

22:49.900 --> 22:51.265
''A woman.'' Your mom? Who?

22:51.368 --> 22:54.895
l don't know! lf l knew, l would tell you!
l don't know!

22:58.809 --> 23:00.401
Here's the thing, Jerry.

23:00.511 --> 23:03.674
This is a bad time to be
in the terrorism business.

23:03.781 --> 23:05.476
You read the paper.

23:06.784 --> 23:08.718
Who do you think is winning?

23:08.819 --> 23:13.654
Your Miranda rights or my right to keep
you in this room as long as l want to?

23:13.757 --> 23:16.590
l don't care if you tell me
the truth about your brother.

23:16.694 --> 23:18.924
l don't care who you work for.

23:19.029 --> 23:24.558
'Cause no matter what you tell me,
you're in a shitload of trouble, son.

23:30.875 --> 23:33.776
This is insane. l work for Copy Cabana.

23:33.878 --> 23:35.937
Yeah, that's what you said.

23:43.220 --> 23:44.881
Listen, l get one night out
in a decade, ladies,

23:44.989 --> 23:47.014
l am not wasting it on Lemon Drops.

23:47.124 --> 23:49.217
-Okay.
-Buck up. Let's go.

23:55.199 --> 23:56.166
Oh, gosh.

23:56.834 --> 24:00.065
l want updates. Catfights, booty calls,
somebody tell me they got lucky.

24:00.170 --> 24:04.300
Hey, ladies. See that guy over there?
He'd like to buy you a round.

24:05.242 --> 24:07.733
Hell, no.
He's got light beer written all over him.

24:07.845 --> 24:08.937
-He's cute.
-Come on.

24:09.046 --> 24:10.104
He's a suit. No.

24:10.214 --> 24:11.442
You sure?

24:11.548 --> 24:12.879
-Come on.
-Who is it?

24:13.684 --> 24:16.676
The one man in my life
who hasn't let me down.

24:17.354 --> 24:20.881
-That's sweet.
-All right, don't drink those without me.

24:21.959 --> 24:23.085
Hello?

24:23.694 --> 24:24.888
Hello?

24:25.863 --> 24:29.560
There's a McDonald's across the street,
Look in the window,

24:29.667 --> 24:30.725
What is this?

24:30.834 --> 24:33.428
Would you risk your life for your son?

24:39.476 --> 24:41.944
Rachel Holloman,
you've been activated,

24:42.046 --> 24:43.809
-This isn't funny.
-Your compliance is vital,

24:43.914 --> 24:45.905
-Who are you?
-We will derail his train,

24:46.016 --> 24:47.608
unless you do what you're told,

24:47.718 --> 24:48.685
What is this?

24:48.786 --> 24:50.583
Don't go back inside the restaurant,

24:50.688 --> 24:53.179
-What?
-There's a black Porsche Cayenne

24:53.290 --> 24:56.020
parked at the northeast corner
of this block,

24:56.126 --> 24:59.357
The keys are in the ignition,
Start walking,

25:01.999 --> 25:03.364
Oh, my God.

25:06.570 --> 25:08.504
91 1,
State the nature of your emergency,

25:08.605 --> 25:11.597
Yeah, some woman just called me.
l have... l have no idea who she is.

25:11.709 --> 25:13.700
She was telling me that...

25:18.182 --> 25:22.050
Your phone is being monitored,
Disobey again and your son dies,

25:26.523 --> 25:28.718
Hey, Grant, l can't read this Shaw file.

25:28.826 --> 25:30.794
-Grant!
-Excuse me.

25:31.328 --> 25:34.161
Listen, my eyes aren't getting any better
and these screens are getting smaller.

25:34.264 --> 25:35.754
Could you please find me
something l can read?

25:35.866 --> 25:37.333
l can make the text bigger
on your screen.

25:37.434 --> 25:38.924
No, no, no. l'm talking about paper.

25:39.036 --> 25:40.401
Remember, like in the olden times?

25:40.504 --> 25:42.028
-Paper. Okay.
-Yeah.

25:42.139 --> 25:45.006
Agent Morgan. Zoe Perez,
Air Force Special lnvestigations.

25:45.109 --> 25:47.543
Ethan Shaw, the twin,
he was one of ours.

25:47.644 --> 25:50.306
Yeah.
OSl said they were sending a liaison.

25:50.414 --> 25:52.143
Can you walk and talk
at the same time?

25:52.249 --> 25:53.511
l'll do my best.

25:53.617 --> 25:55.482
File says he died in a traffic accident.

25:55.586 --> 25:59.386
Truck ran a light, corner of
Constitution and 10th, Northwest D.C.

25:59.490 --> 26:01.788
So truck ran a light,
his brother gets 750 large

26:01.892 --> 26:04.053
and enough hardware
to start his own Costco,

26:04.161 --> 26:06.595
five hours after enemy
chatter hits the roof.

26:06.697 --> 26:08.562
l mean, don't you find that
a little coincidental?

26:08.665 --> 26:13.329
What if it's a decoy? To distract us from
something 50 times bigger,

26:25.049 --> 26:28.018
-Time for your phone call.
-l thought l didn't get one.

26:28.118 --> 26:31.019
Attorney General's office
changed their mind.

26:32.890 --> 26:35.120
Ethan Shaw had a 183 lQ

26:35.225 --> 26:37.523
and yet you had him
as a mid-level press flak.

26:37.628 --> 26:39.186
Why not lT or cyber-warfare?

26:39.296 --> 26:41.355
Are you suggesting
that he was overqualified?

26:41.465 --> 26:43.831
Or that he was somehow slipping intel
to the Copy Cabana?

26:43.934 --> 26:45.731
No, l'm suggesting
that maybe Ethan Shaw

26:45.836 --> 26:49.932
was a superstar rocket scientist genius
who did go wrong,

26:50.040 --> 26:53.601
and the Air Force doesn't want
their dirty laundry flapping in the wind.

26:53.710 --> 26:57.441
Think what you like, but l need to get in
that room and interrogate him myself.

26:57.548 --> 26:58.537
No.

27:07.324 --> 27:09.622
You don't have a choice. Look.

27:09.726 --> 27:12.820
Now, neither of us know if either of
those brothers are guilty or innocent,

27:12.930 --> 27:17.594
so on behalf of the Secretary
of the Air Force, l'm going in that room.

27:18.435 --> 27:21.131
Well, on behalf of
all that fucking bomb equipment

27:21.238 --> 27:24.230
in junior pinhead's apartment,
no, you're not.

27:33.717 --> 27:37.050
We told you to run,
We have planned your escape,

27:37.154 --> 27:39.054
How'd you get on this phone?
Who are you?

27:39.156 --> 27:40.987
Lay flat on the floor immediately,

27:41.091 --> 27:42.490
What the...
What the hell are you talking about?

27:42.593 --> 27:43.719
Four seconds, Jerry,

27:43.827 --> 27:45.988
-No, this is bullshit. l don't...
-Get down now,

27:46.096 --> 27:47.397
Two seconds,

28:10.654 --> 28:11.643
No!

28:15.092 --> 28:17.993
-No! l didn't do this!
-Get down!

28:23.000 --> 28:24.433
Shit.

28:57.868 --> 29:01.531
Standing passengers,
please do not lean against the doors,

29:06.643 --> 29:10.511
,,,fourteen Americans dead
throughout Europe and the Middle East,

29:10.614 --> 29:13.447
with terror groups insisting
this is just the beginning

29:13.550 --> 29:17.611
of a campaign the West invited
when it allegedly rained bombs

29:17.721 --> 29:20.713
on a religious ceremony
outside the small town of Abda,

29:20.824 --> 29:23.122
near the border of Afghanistan,

29:34.338 --> 29:38.240
Stay on the train for three more stations
and wait at the bottom of the platform,

29:38.342 --> 29:40.071
You will receive,,,

30:01.665 --> 30:07.297
Doors closing, Standing passengers,
please do not lean against the doors,

30:32.863 --> 30:35.127
-Help!
-Jimmy.

30:35.232 --> 30:39.134
My baby. l need some help. Somebody.

30:39.236 --> 30:40.828
-What?
-You're not listening,

30:40.937 --> 30:42.598
We told you to stay on the train,

30:42.706 --> 30:45.402
-How are you doing this?
-Next stop is Wilson Station,

30:45.509 --> 30:48.239
A black Porsche Cayenne will be
waiting at the northwest exit,

30:48.345 --> 30:49.812
-Listen.
-Get in the passenger seat,

30:49.913 --> 30:52.438
Listen! No, l'm done.

30:54.451 --> 30:57.750
-Hello?
-The man in front of the exit door

30:57.854 --> 31:00.345
in a black coat is a wanted terrorist,

31:00.457 --> 31:03.551
-His name is Jerry Shaw,
-Who is this?

31:06.330 --> 31:07.319
-You Jerry Shaw?
-No, no, no.

31:07.431 --> 31:09.422
Wilson Station, Exit now,

31:09.933 --> 31:11.400
That's the guy!

31:13.437 --> 31:16.304
l said, are you Jerry Shaw?
Hey! Come here!

31:38.462 --> 31:39.724
Watch it!

31:44.701 --> 31:46.066
-Drive the car! Drive the car!
-No!

31:46.169 --> 31:47.761
-l did what you asked me to do!
-l'm not going anywhere...

31:47.871 --> 31:49.338
-You tell... Stop!
-...until you tell me my son's safe!

31:49.439 --> 31:51.339
Who's your son?
l don't know what you're talking about!

31:51.441 --> 31:53.432
-l'll kill you if you hurt my son!
-l almost died over this shit!

31:53.543 --> 31:55.306
-Listen, lady, l don't know who...
-Tell me Sam is safe!

31:55.412 --> 31:56.811
Who is... Will you stop hitting me?

31:56.913 --> 31:59.507
Are you the woman
who called me on the phone?

31:59.616 --> 32:01.948
-Did you call me on the phone?
-No. The woman.

32:02.052 --> 32:03.519
-She called you, too?
-She called you, too?

32:03.620 --> 32:04.848
Drive,

32:07.290 --> 32:09.815
Get out! Now! Get out of the vehicle!

32:11.395 --> 32:12.487
Stop!

32:19.970 --> 32:22.097
-Why is this happening?
-Go, go, go, go, go!

32:22.205 --> 32:24.105
Who are you and
why are people shooting at us?

32:24.207 --> 32:26.573
Drive the car! Clutch!

32:26.676 --> 32:30.237
Accelerate, Turn right, 200 feet,
You have pursuers,

32:30.347 --> 32:33.145
-Yeah, no shit! Who are you?
-No questions,

32:34.117 --> 32:35.584
Turn right now,

32:42.359 --> 32:43.553
So you don't know anything about Sam?

32:43.660 --> 32:45.560
What, you mean your son?
No, l know nothing.

32:45.662 --> 32:46.629
Just like you don't know how to drive.

32:46.730 --> 32:48.391
Use the clutch before you shift,
not while you shift!

32:48.498 --> 32:49.556
l don't need driving lessons
from you, asshole!

32:49.666 --> 32:51.566
What, you drive like this
and l'm the asshole?

32:51.668 --> 32:53.135
Turn left now,

33:00.877 --> 33:04.643
All units. Suspect in a Porsche
Cayenne heading west on Grand.

33:04.748 --> 33:07.342
-All units respond, Code 3.
-There!

33:13.056 --> 33:17.152
Maintain a speed of 50 miles an hour,
Stay in the second lane from the right,

33:17.260 --> 33:19.660
-The light's red!
-Accelerate now,

33:30.073 --> 33:32.234
Get me a roadblock
at Granville and Sheridan.

33:32.342 --> 33:33.570
Oh, shit.

33:37.080 --> 33:39.446
The lights are all turning green.

33:44.054 --> 33:45.385
Holy shit!

33:59.669 --> 34:01.159
-Holy...
-Shit!

34:04.708 --> 34:06.175
Get in close.

34:08.277 --> 34:09.643
Go, go, go!

34:12.449 --> 34:15.213
-Shit!
-Brake, Brake now,

34:15.886 --> 34:17.284
Get in here!

34:26.830 --> 34:29.424
Accelerate to 60 miles per hour,

34:32.002 --> 34:33.697
Clutch. Clutch!

34:34.204 --> 34:35.501
-Use the clutch!
-l'm clutching!

34:35.605 --> 34:38.072
l'm watching, you're not clutching!

34:41.344 --> 34:43.402
-Stop!
-l'm not stopping.

34:45.681 --> 34:47.513
Slow down. Slow down, the light's red.

34:47.617 --> 34:50.643
Don't slow down,
Accelerate to 72 miles per hour,

34:50.754 --> 34:52.654
-Slow down. lt's a red light!
-You will make it through,

34:52.755 --> 34:54.188
-Stop!
-No way.

34:54.958 --> 34:56.516
-Brake!
-l can't!

34:58.194 --> 34:59.923
-Brake!
-Stop!

35:17.914 --> 35:19.677
Manual control's been restored,

35:19.783 --> 35:23.150
Continue straight
until you reach Pier 1 5,

35:31.394 --> 35:33.726
Enter the wrecking yard,
Proceed to the end of the dock,

35:33.830 --> 35:36.560
We will eliminate all obstacles for you,

35:45.308 --> 35:47.071
Watch! Watch! Watch!

36:17.273 --> 36:19.241
-Stay your course,
-Turn!

36:20.844 --> 36:22.971
-Turn!
-Turn right now,

36:40.196 --> 36:41.163
Holy...

36:53.843 --> 36:54.810
Oh, God.

36:56.346 --> 36:57.335
Oh, my God!

37:00.984 --> 37:02.781
-Grab the seat.
-l can't.

37:02.886 --> 37:05.320
-Grab the seat! The seat!
-No, l can't!

37:07.390 --> 37:08.357
No!

37:20.470 --> 37:24.031
The crane will release the car,
lf you do not jump, you will drown,

37:24.140 --> 37:27.337
-We have to jump.
-No! No way.

37:27.444 --> 37:30.208
We have to. When l say ''go.''

37:32.949 --> 37:33.938
Ready?

37:35.118 --> 37:37.450
Go! Jump!

37:56.706 --> 37:58.731
l want both the divers in that water!

38:02.946 --> 38:04.709
-Let's go! Move!
-Let's go, let's go!

38:04.814 --> 38:06.042
Move, move, move!

38:23.366 --> 38:26.733
-Yeah, l already called it in!
-Wait till it clears!

38:28.338 --> 38:29.862
Thirty feet back, that's it!

38:29.973 --> 38:31.406
Yeah, l know,
the Army sent a Black Hawk,

38:31.508 --> 38:32.873
so l'll be there in a couple of hours.

38:32.976 --> 38:35.945
What do you mean,
the car is not registered to anyone?

38:36.045 --> 38:37.239
Check the VlN number again.

38:37.981 --> 38:42.441
Leave your message for Sam,
even though l know it's you, Mom,

38:43.119 --> 38:45.815
Sam? Baby, listen to me.

38:45.922 --> 38:48.789
You need to call me
as soon as you get this message, okay?

38:49.559 --> 38:53.256
Baby, please. l love you.

38:55.198 --> 38:56.961
-What about the girl?
-What?

38:57.066 --> 38:58.590
What about the girl?

38:58.701 --> 39:00.669
Well, the Department of Transpo
tells me that there was

39:00.770 --> 39:03.261
a seven-minute equipment failure
on their traffic cams.

39:03.373 --> 39:05.034
-We didn't get a picture of her.
-Don't tell me that.

39:05.141 --> 39:07.609
-That's what they're telling me!
-l need an lD on that girl.

39:10.413 --> 39:12.472
Do you think they could derail a train?

39:14.117 --> 39:16.210
They changed every traffic light
to get us here.

39:16.319 --> 39:18.116
The woman, she called me
on a stranger's cell phone

39:18.221 --> 39:20.416
who happened to be sitting next to me.
Never met the guy in my life.

39:20.523 --> 39:22.457
You know, and then they broke me out
of maximum security custody

39:22.559 --> 39:24.789
in a way l'm not even gonna describe
to you because it sounds crazy,

39:24.894 --> 39:28.489
and then they lift us off the face of
the Earth and drop us into this shit pile?

39:28.598 --> 39:29.826
She could probably derail a train.

39:29.933 --> 39:31.594
She could probably turn a train
into a talking duck.

39:31.968 --> 39:35.631
And what about these goddamn ghost
cranes that keep helping peewee out?

39:35.738 --> 39:38.605
l mean, they don't just lift cars
up in the air all by themselves

39:38.708 --> 39:40.232
like a giant pair of chopsticks.

39:41.444 --> 39:43.344
l want to know how these things run,
how they're programmed.

39:44.113 --> 39:45.910
What'd you say your name was?

39:46.015 --> 39:48.108
-Rachel.
-l'm Jerry.

39:55.925 --> 39:58.519
-Hello?
-The barge will dock in 1 4 minutes,

39:58.628 --> 40:02.894
Leave the boatyard with the female,
Take Highway 123 East,

40:02.999 --> 40:05.593
Walk to mile marker 108,

40:06.236 --> 40:10.434
-What? Was it her?
-She called you ''the female.''

40:11.441 --> 40:14.968
Have Mortuary Affairs freeze everything
belonging to Ethan Shaw.

40:15.078 --> 40:18.377
-No personal effects to next of kin.
-You, Due Process!

40:18.481 --> 40:20.312
-Bye.
-What do you have on Ethan Shaw?

40:20.416 --> 40:23.112
l have a name. lt's Agent Perez.

40:23.219 --> 40:25.414
And l'll answer that question
when l get back from D.C.

40:25.521 --> 40:28.922
-Wait a minute. What's in D.C.?
-Shaw's private quarters.

40:29.025 --> 40:32.927
l need you to stay here.
l'm not losing my link to Ethan Shaw.

40:33.029 --> 40:35.054
Maybe l haven't made this clear.

40:35.164 --> 40:38.133
l don't work for you.
l work for the Air Force.

40:38.234 --> 40:40.998
Keep your phone on,
l'll keep you updated.

40:46.542 --> 40:50.535
lf you're staring at me, it better be
because l'm the goddamn suspect.

40:50.813 --> 40:54.305
Because if l don't get some good leads
soon, you're all gonna be demoted

40:54.417 --> 40:57.750
into something that's gonna require
touching shit with your hands.

40:58.187 --> 41:00.883
Now, let's get going. We got work to do.

41:08.564 --> 41:12.159
Hexamethylene.
Our latest chemical explosive.

41:12.268 --> 41:17.672
One single tiny crystal,
80 times more powerful than C4.

41:17.774 --> 41:20.106
Odorless, undetectable.

41:20.209 --> 41:23.838
And best of all, it can be
cut down in size for stealth operations,

41:23.947 --> 41:25.847
This valve is a sonic trigger.

41:25.949 --> 41:28.213
The sound frequency
triggers the explosion,

41:28.318 --> 41:30.513
Each trigger is programmed
to have a unique

41:30.620 --> 41:33.248
frequency specific
only to one Hex crystal.

41:33.356 --> 41:35.290
That frequency triggers the explosion,

41:40.730 --> 41:41.822
Yeah,

41:42.598 --> 41:45.829
We recently received approval
to begin shipping to the field.

41:45.935 --> 41:47.732
Two hundred units
are shipping out today.

42:09.525 --> 42:11.356
-Sign right here.
-Yeah.

42:11.728 --> 42:12.956
Thank you.

42:16.366 --> 42:19.802
The package you've just received
contains a small metal valve,

42:19.902 --> 42:21.369
Open the package,

42:25.141 --> 42:26.699
-Okay.
-Remove the valve

42:26.809 --> 42:29.107
and follow our instructions precisely,

42:38.021 --> 42:40.819
-You've received the package,
-Yes, ma'am, it just arrived,

42:40.923 --> 42:43.255
-What kind of stone is this?
-No questions,

42:43.359 --> 42:44.917
Cut the stone and place the setting

42:45.028 --> 42:47.189
according to the specifications
we sent you,

43:31.007 --> 43:33.202
l'd just dropped my son off at the train,

43:33.309 --> 43:36.142
l was out having drinks with my
girlfriends when the call came,

43:36.245 --> 43:38.839
-What about you?
-The first call came to my apartment,

43:39.282 --> 43:41.147
-After the boxes?
-Yeah,

43:42.652 --> 43:45.746
Well, then this whole thing's
obviously gotta be about your brother.

43:45.855 --> 43:47.948
-Really, it's that obvious, huh?
-l mean, you got all this stuff.

43:48.057 --> 43:49.547
The weapons, the cash,
the airplane manuals.

43:49.659 --> 43:50.717
-Okay.
-He was your twin.

43:50.827 --> 43:51.851
-They sent it to the wrong brother.
-Right.

43:51.961 --> 43:53.121
So you're implying
my brother's a terrorist.

43:53.229 --> 43:55.823
l'm implying, if not him, then why you?

44:00.903 --> 44:04.464
l'm sorry. l know he just died. l'm not
trying to insult his memory or anything.

44:04.574 --> 44:07.441
No, he hasn't been dead long enough
to be a memory, Rachel.

44:08.044 --> 44:09.636
lf you knew my brother,
you'd laugh all day at the idea

44:09.745 --> 44:11.770
that he was a terrorist or a spy
or whatever else you're saying...

44:11.881 --> 44:12.973
-How do you know?
-Because he's my brother.

44:13.082 --> 44:14.310
That's something you would know
about your brother.

44:14.417 --> 44:16.715
Well, when's the last time
you talked to him?

44:22.125 --> 44:26.824
l don't need this. Hey, listen. Hey!
l don't have to explain myself to you.

44:26.929 --> 44:28.760
-ls your son a terrorist?
-Yeah, my son's a terrorist.

44:28.865 --> 44:30.958
Yeah, well, he's just as likely
to be a terrorist as my brother.

44:31.067 --> 44:33.695
And let's not forget you in all this. Why
are you here? What's your day job?

44:33.803 --> 44:35.566
-l know it isn't manual shift driver.
-l'm a paralegal.

44:36.472 --> 44:37.406
-l don't have a connection to anything.
-Paralegal?

44:37.406 --> 44:37.701
-l don't have a connection to anything.
-Paralegal?

44:37.807 --> 44:40.037
How do l know you're not lying to me?
What does a paralegal do?

44:40.143 --> 44:41.940
The same thing as the guys
with their names on the door,

44:42.044 --> 44:45.480
except l do it for $1 1 an hour,
so they can bill 200.

44:45.581 --> 44:46.946
That nail it for you, Sherlock?

44:47.049 --> 44:48.573
That still doesn't explain why
we're walking out here...

44:48.684 --> 44:50.948
-l don't know why the hell l'm out here!
-Yeah, l know...

44:58.294 --> 44:59.261
Hey!

45:00.830 --> 45:03.060
-Are you Jerry Shaw?
-Who are you?

45:03.166 --> 45:05.566
-Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
-l sent the package like she asked.

45:05.668 --> 45:06.965
-Wait, what package?
-What is that?

45:07.069 --> 45:08.331
-Now she wants me to drive you?
-Who, ''she''?

45:08.437 --> 45:09.802
-l won't. l'm done!
-You know ''she''?

45:09.906 --> 45:10.964
-Wait.
-Stay right there.

45:11.073 --> 45:12.540
-Get back.
-Here. Here's the address.

45:12.642 --> 45:15.543
-Why are you attack...
-Here. Here are the keys.

45:15.645 --> 45:16.612
Take the goddamn van!

45:16.712 --> 45:17.701
-You think l'm going to...
-Who's doing this?

45:17.813 --> 45:21.408
...do this because l'm lranian?
l am American. l'm finished! l'm done!

45:21.517 --> 45:24.008
-What? What are you talking about?
-You take it!

45:24.120 --> 45:25.917
-What are you talking about?
-l won't do this because l can't.

45:26.022 --> 45:28.047
-Hello?
-Stop him now, or he will die,

45:28.157 --> 45:29.715
Listen to me,
what are you talking about?

45:29.825 --> 45:31.793
-You try to do this without me!
-How are you seeing us right now?

45:31.894 --> 45:34.055
-Stop him now,
-What is she saying?

45:34.163 --> 45:36.529
Stop. Hey! You gotta stop!

45:36.632 --> 45:39.465
-Wait!
-You gotta stop!

46:12.835 --> 46:15.827
-You killed that man.
-Desertion is not an option,

46:15.938 --> 46:18.736
Take the van,
Drive to lndianapolis, lndiana,

46:18.841 --> 46:23.574
72 West 56th Street,
Arrive no later than 1 1:00 a,m,

46:35.758 --> 46:37.953
-Welcome.
-Hello. Agent Perez.

46:38.728 --> 46:39.888
-To the right?
-Yes, ma'am.

46:41.130 --> 46:42.825
-lD, ma'am.
-OSl.

46:42.932 --> 46:45.526
l ordered a freeze on Ethan Shaw's
personal effects. What's going on?

46:45.635 --> 46:47.364
Orders to sanitize came down
from the Two Star.

46:47.470 --> 46:49.233
Okay, l'm countermanding.
Thank you. l'll take that.

46:49.338 --> 46:50.498
-Tell your guys to clear out.
-Who are you?

46:50.606 --> 46:52.198
This scene's part of
a federal investigation

46:52.308 --> 46:54.333
with national security ramifications.
This your log?

46:54.443 --> 46:56.001
-Yes, it is.
-Okay, my name is Agent Perez.

46:56.112 --> 46:57.079
You can take this up
with your superiors.

46:57.179 --> 46:58.305
-Clear the room!
-You guys move out.

46:58.414 --> 47:00.541
No gloves?
Get statements from everybody.

47:00.650 --> 47:01.878
-Yes, ma'am.
-And find out who this Two Star is.

47:01.984 --> 47:03.918
l mean, come on, really!

47:19.835 --> 47:22.201
Sir! We have a positive lD.

47:33.082 --> 47:34.242
Okay.

47:35.518 --> 47:38.112
The skin was pretty fried,
but we still managed to get

47:38.220 --> 47:42.213
a partial print that matches
to a Ranim Khalid.

47:42.325 --> 47:46.853
He's a United States citizen, registered
Republican, and he owns a music store.

47:46.962 --> 47:49.396
-The guy's cleaner than lvory Snow.
-Got something here.

47:50.900 --> 47:52.993
-That's a bone mic.
-Hello.

47:53.102 --> 47:55.570
Military grade.
He didn't get that on eBay.

47:55.671 --> 47:57.434
Someone was talking to him.

48:29.071 --> 48:30.732
We have a cyber-terrorist here.

48:30.840 --> 48:32.967
Someone's already inside
our computer systems,

48:33.075 --> 48:37.842
hacking into the power grid,
traffic cams, automated cranes.

48:37.947 --> 48:40.507
There's no way the boy
and the girl did this alone.

49:12.848 --> 49:14.247
-Agent Zoe Perez?
-Yes.

49:14.350 --> 49:17.183
United States Air Force
Security Forces. Please come with us.

49:17.286 --> 49:19.311
-What's this about?
-Get in the car.

49:21.290 --> 49:24.020
Violence has broken out
in the Middle East as militants accuse

49:24.126 --> 49:26.321
the United States
of launching American missiles

49:26.429 --> 49:30.627
to demolish a village in Baluchistan,
killing innocent civilians,

49:30.733 --> 49:34.134
The attack has triggered a
series of retaliatory suicide bombings

49:34.236 --> 49:36.500
against American embassies abroad,

49:36.605 --> 49:40.735
Early reports indicate the American
death toll now stands at 56,

49:41.177 --> 49:43.611
with threats of further violence
here at home,

49:43.712 --> 49:45.179
Officials,,,

49:50.920 --> 49:52.945
What's he doing on a train, your kid?

49:54.023 --> 49:56.287
He goes to a music magnet.

49:56.392 --> 49:59.725
His school's on a tour of Washington.
They're playing at the Kennedy Center.

49:59.829 --> 50:03.560
Wow. That's big. And you just...

50:06.936 --> 50:09.063
Well, why'd you make that noise, ''Huh''?

50:09.171 --> 50:10.695
l can't make noises now?

50:11.974 --> 50:14.169
-You think l should have gone.
-He's playing at the Kennedy Center.

50:14.276 --> 50:15.766
-That's kind of a big deal.
-lt is a big deal.

50:15.878 --> 50:18.108
So l think maybe one parent
should have gone, that's all l'm saying.

50:18.214 --> 50:19.806
Well, one parent had to work
while the other one does

50:19.915 --> 50:22.748
everything humanly possible
to bail on child support.

50:23.752 --> 50:26.619
But l don't expect you to know
a thing about responsibility.

50:28.491 --> 50:30.186
You know, Rachel, you don't know
the first thing about me.

50:30.292 --> 50:31.850
l know your brother just died,
and whatever he was into

50:31.961 --> 50:34.088
-put my son's life at risk.
-l don't wanna talk about my brother.

50:34.196 --> 50:36.687
-Okay? l'm not kidding.
-l'm not kidding, either.

50:36.799 --> 50:38.767
Jesus, look what happened.

50:39.668 --> 50:41.397
Can you honestly say he had
nothing to do with this?

50:41.504 --> 50:43.369
l'm asking you not to talk about him!
Respect that.

50:43.472 --> 50:45.441
l'm asking you to be honest
with yourself. Your brother's a...

50:45.441 --> 50:45.998
l'm asking you to be honest
with yourself. Your brother's a...

51:06.295 --> 51:12.165
Hey! You can't just walk away!
You can't just leave!

51:12.701 --> 51:14.259

51:38.060 --> 51:39.425

52:06.488 --> 52:10.891
You are two minutes behind schedule,
Go to the alley behind the building,

52:14.163 --> 52:17.690
-Go to the armored truck,
-l don't see an armored truck.

52:18.834 --> 52:20.233
There it is.

52:25.674 --> 52:29.576
ln 20 seconds, men will exit
the elevator, They will be armed,

52:29.678 --> 52:31.236
One will be carrying a briefcase,

52:31.347 --> 52:33.508
Retrieve it from him,
then return to the van,

52:33.616 --> 52:35.447
-This is insane. l'm not doing this.
-You want us to rob them?

52:35.551 --> 52:37.018
You now have 1 5 seconds,

52:40.189 --> 52:42.384
Security, What's your emergency?

52:47.162 --> 52:50.996

You were gonna say bombs.

55:58.153 --> 56:00.883

Middle name: Soledad,

01:01:26.912 --> 01:01:30.313
Official service records indicate
your field reports are very thorough,

01:01:30.416 --> 01:01:31.883
if poorly formatted,

01:01:33.953 --> 01:01:37.116
Please excuse us,
Detecting 76% probability

01:01:37.223 --> 01:01:40.249
valid threat at Los Angeles

Alerting airport authorities
and local police,

01:01:43.195 --> 01:01:45.789
Those gold spheres send her
infrared data,

01:01:45.898 --> 01:01:48.264
any communication intercepts
that she flags a threat.

01:01:49.201 --> 01:01:52.102

01:02:07.453 --> 01:02:12.049
Mr. Secretary? A call for you.

01:02:13.025 --> 01:02:14.959

-Major.
-Sir?

01:02:25.838 --> 01:02:29.001
Your profile reveals a pathological
aversion to conformity,

education, career, even voting,

01:02:32.411 --> 01:02:34.572
Therefore, we conclude
that extreme coercion

01:02:34.680 --> 01:02:36.307
is necessary to motivate you,

01:02:36.415 --> 01:02:39.282
Unlike your brother Ethan,
who was self-motivated,

01:02:39.385 --> 01:02:41.410
How do you know my brother?
He worked in a press office.

01:02:41.520 --> 01:02:44.148
His employment there was a cover,

01:02:44.256 --> 01:02:47.487
Everyone in counterintelligence
operations has one,

01:02:48.594 --> 01:02:52.826
Ethan was a Minuteman, just like me.
Army, Navy, Air Force.

01:02:52.932 --> 01:02:55.298
Every branch of the military had
a Minuteman posted here

01:02:55.401 --> 01:03:00.429
for a 12-hour shift, just in case she
flags a threat, and monitor hardware.

01:03:00.539 --> 01:03:05.806
The night Ethan died, he left this post
three minutes early.

01:03:05.911 --> 01:03:08.880
Now, you don't do that. Ever.

01:03:09.448 --> 01:03:12.542
You are both required
to complete a task,

01:03:12.651 --> 01:03:15.279
-What?
-The protection of our national security,

01:03:15.387 --> 01:03:17.821
The Constitution allows for civilians
to be recruited

01:03:17.923 --> 01:03:19.254
-for the national defense,
-l'm done.

01:03:19.358 --> 01:03:21.417
l'm done. You don't know me!
You don't know my brother!

01:03:21.527 --> 01:03:24.519
This is bullshit! l'm not serving
in the goddamn national defense!

01:03:24.630 --> 01:03:27.463
We know all about him, Jerry, And you,

01:03:28.934 --> 01:03:31.459
Before he was a year old,
Ethan walked,

01:03:32.238 --> 01:03:35.298
The same task took you
1 8 months to accomplish,

01:03:37.543 --> 01:03:38.840
-How did you get this?
-Look at Ethan,

01:03:38.944 --> 01:03:41.310
They were uploaded
from his home computer,

01:03:41.413 --> 01:03:44.007
You want to come over here, sweetie?
Come on over here with Ethan,

01:03:44.116 --> 01:03:46.744
-Jerry! Birthday cake, Let's go,
-Ethan had these?

01:03:46.852 --> 01:03:48.149
Come on, let's blow out the candles,

01:03:48.254 --> 01:03:50.017
Just for a little bit,

01:03:50.122 --> 01:03:54.286
Although you're identical in appearance,
you lack the motivation and talent

01:03:54.393 --> 01:03:56.588
-that enabled Ethan to excel,
-,,,Jerry, come on,

01:03:56.695 --> 01:03:58.424
-Stop it.
-Do it like Ethan did,

01:03:58.531 --> 01:04:02.365
You're different from Ethan
in every way, except one,

01:04:02.501 --> 01:04:04.526
Jerry, let your brother help you, Jerry!

01:04:04.637 --> 01:04:08.767
You now have 1 4 minutes to change
your appearance and return to the bus,

01:04:18.250 --> 01:04:20.309
We have 1 4 minutes.

01:04:27.159 --> 01:04:29.218
These couriers were hired
by Halloway-Smith

01:04:29.328 --> 01:04:32.024
-to transport some sort of case.
-The chemical company?

01:04:32.131 --> 01:04:35.259
Yes, exactly. Now, whatever was
in that case, Shaw now has.

01:04:35.367 --> 01:04:36.834
They went right for the case.

01:04:36.936 --> 01:04:41.566
Give us a minute, will you? We need
to know exactly what was in that case.

01:04:41.674 --> 01:04:44.768
They never tell you what's in the case.
l mean, it could Bubonic Plague.

01:04:44.877 --> 01:04:47.175
-Could be Grandpa's Viagra.
-You know anything?

01:04:47.279 --> 01:04:48.678
-What?
-Anything at all?

01:04:49.381 --> 01:04:51.474
-What about these guns?
-What about them?

01:04:51.584 --> 01:04:52.915
lt was a pump-action Remington 870.

01:04:53.018 --> 01:04:55.987
Yeah, l know what kind of guns they are.
Get me a gun.

01:04:56.088 --> 01:04:57.578
How were they holding them?
Get me a gun!

01:04:57.690 --> 01:04:59.089
What the hell do you mean,
how were they holding them?

01:04:59.191 --> 01:05:01.819
l mean, in what position
were they holding the gun?

01:05:01.927 --> 01:05:04.293
-For instance, like this?
-Hey, hey, hey.

01:05:04.396 --> 01:05:05.795
-Put that damned thing down!
-Or like in a music video,

01:05:05.898 --> 01:05:07.099
-or something like that?
-Hey, hey, hey!

01:05:07.232 --> 01:05:08.221
-Put it down!
-They weren't pros!

01:05:08.334 --> 01:05:09.460
Okay, that's what l was asking you.

01:05:09.568 --> 01:05:11.035
So they didn't know
how to handle a weapon.

01:05:11.136 --> 01:05:12.262
-No.
-All right.

01:05:12.371 --> 01:05:14.236
Get what you can
out of Batman and Robin here.

01:05:14.340 --> 01:05:16.103
-Yeah.
-Thank you.

01:05:16.208 --> 01:05:18.972
We just checked cameras.
They said Shaw fired at one...

01:05:19.078 --> 01:05:21.876
Don't tell me.
Everything magically went black.

01:05:46.105 --> 01:05:48.505
Hi, my name's Thomas Morgan.
l'm with the FBl.

01:05:48.607 --> 01:05:51.576
-Are your cameras on a network?
-No, man,

01:05:51.677 --> 01:05:54.441
-VCR's in the back.
-Well, l'm gonna need your tapes.

01:05:57.349 --> 01:05:58.373
Shit.

01:06:01.353 --> 01:06:02.320
Sam!

01:06:02.755 --> 01:06:04.848
-Sam? Sam, where are you?
-Hey, Mom, l got your message,

01:06:04.957 --> 01:06:06.322
The train's awesome!

01:06:06.425 --> 01:06:08.120
-Sam, listen to me.
-Brian tried to burp the alphabet,

01:06:08.227 --> 01:06:10.058
-but he gagged when he got to "M,"
-Listen to me.

01:06:10.162 --> 01:06:11.891
Call you when l hit D,C, Bye, Mom,

01:06:11.997 --> 01:06:14.397
Your son left that message
60 seconds ago,

01:06:14.700 --> 01:06:18.033
You will see him again,
But there's something we require first,

01:06:19.772 --> 01:06:22.332
-Thank you.
-Here you go.

01:06:27.413 --> 01:06:30.507
-No.
-You will do it, or Sam will die,

01:06:30.883 --> 01:06:33.181
You have six minutes
to return to the bus,

01:06:42.194 --> 01:06:44.594
-Ready?
-Here, you okay?

01:06:45.030 --> 01:06:45.997
We should go.

01:06:50.069 --> 01:06:54.062
Sir, we got something.
Play this screen right here.

01:06:55.040 --> 01:06:58.168
Okay, freeze that. Now zoom in
on the front of the bus right there.

01:06:58.277 --> 01:06:59.642
-Put it up on the other monitor.
-Yes, sir.

01:06:59.745 --> 01:07:02.714
Now zoom in.
Zoom in on this point right here.

01:07:02.815 --> 01:07:04.612
Can we zoom in tighter than that?

01:07:07.052 --> 01:07:09.179
Okay, enhance that shot.

01:07:10.756 --> 01:07:12.986
That's our guy, that's Jerry Shaw.

01:07:14.093 --> 01:07:17.324
Zoom in right here on this spot.
Right there. The reflection.

01:07:17.429 --> 01:07:18.987
All right. All right.

01:07:19.098 --> 01:07:20.998
Right there. Hello, sweetheart.

01:07:21.100 --> 01:07:24.263
Okay, so we got
a white brunette female,

01:07:24.369 --> 01:07:26.599
mid to late 20s, approximately 5'9''.

01:07:26.705 --> 01:07:28.468
Find me that chartered bus!

01:07:28.574 --> 01:07:32.271
Masako. M-A-S-A-K-O.
Sightseeing Tours.

01:07:32.377 --> 01:07:33.344
What time did they get on?

01:07:39.585 --> 01:07:42.247
l'm sorry for what l said about Ethan.

01:07:51.096 --> 01:07:53.587
lt's like he had a rocket
strapped to his back.

01:07:53.699 --> 01:07:56.190
And it wasn't his fault.
He was just that way.

01:07:56.802 --> 01:07:58.861
And l was not that way.

01:08:00.806 --> 01:08:04.833
l was the complete opposite.
l was the brother with lead shoes.

01:08:07.079 --> 01:08:09.104
That was my role, l was good at it.

01:08:11.049 --> 01:08:13.950
And he'd always try to help me.
You know, ''This is how you throw it.''

01:08:14.052 --> 01:08:17.715
''Do it like this.'' ''Write it like that.''
''Put your foot here.''

01:08:17.823 --> 01:08:21.417
Even with the small things.
Homework, chores, anything like that,

01:08:21.527 --> 01:08:23.221
he would handle it
and then say that l did it,

01:08:23.328 --> 01:08:27.787
just so my father would notice me.
That was Ethan.

01:08:35.307 --> 01:08:38.640
He never asked me for anything. Ever.

01:08:40.444 --> 01:08:45.576
And whatever this is, he was part of it.
l feel like he needs my help to finish it.

01:08:47.986 --> 01:08:49.419
l owe him that.

01:08:56.995 --> 01:09:00.225
We are now approaching
Dayton lnternational Airport,

01:09:00.332 --> 01:09:05.531
Please use caution as you exit the bus,
And don't forget any of your belongings,

01:09:05.636 --> 01:09:06.729
Thank you,

01:09:08.240 --> 01:09:11.732
Attention, passengers, Please do not
leave your luggage unattended,

01:09:12.109 --> 01:09:14.475
Unattended luggage is subject
to collection and search

01:09:14.580 --> 01:09:17.912
by the airport police,
Thank you for your cooperation,

01:09:21.185 --> 01:09:23.017
Yes, l'm walking toward them now. Yes.

01:09:23.121 --> 01:09:26.818
Hey. These are from her.
Go to the ticketing machine.

01:09:26.925 --> 01:09:30.486
Use the credit card to get your tickets.
Then walk to Gate 1-C.

01:09:31.964 --> 01:09:33.295
They now have them.

01:09:39.104 --> 01:09:40.435
That's a nice picture.

01:09:46.979 --> 01:09:50.073
Okay. l need you guys at every exit,
watching faces.

01:09:50.182 --> 01:09:51.911
Work the secure area first.

01:09:52.017 --> 01:09:53.416
Go to the tower, have them order

01:09:53.518 --> 01:09:55.986
a ground stop.
Don't change the departure boards.

01:09:56.088 --> 01:09:57.919
We don't want them to know
we're coming.

01:10:06.398 --> 01:10:09.890
Sir, can you please shut the cell phone
off? You cannot take it through.

01:10:10.002 --> 01:10:12.027
-FBl. Clear the way.
-FBl. Please step back.

01:10:17.509 --> 01:10:19.238
Please, there are others behind you.

01:10:19.344 --> 01:10:21.244
-Keep it moving.
-Shoes and hats off, please!

01:10:21.346 --> 01:10:24.440
-Shoes also, yes.
-Laptops should be out of their cases!

01:10:24.549 --> 01:10:26.881
You need to make sure your jackets
are off and screened separately.

01:10:26.985 --> 01:10:30.250
-Sir, step in the circle, please.
-Have boarding passes in hand, please!

01:10:30.355 --> 01:10:31.720
We need to move this line quickly.

01:10:31.823 --> 01:10:34.155
Sir, that needs to go through.

01:10:34.726 --> 01:10:37.456
Ma'am, anything in your pockets?
Move it along.

01:10:40.032 --> 01:10:41.966
Hats and shoes off, please!

01:10:42.067 --> 01:10:45.161
-Laptops should be out of your bags!
-All right, next in line, please.

01:10:45.270 --> 01:10:46.737
Have your tickets ready.

01:10:50.876 --> 01:10:54.778
-Ma'am? Hat and shoes go in the bin.
-Step through.

01:11:00.052 --> 01:11:01.019
Wait.

01:11:01.353 --> 01:11:06.552
Shoes and hats off, please!
Laptops should be out of their bags!

01:11:18.303 --> 01:11:19.327
Go ahead.

01:11:19.438 --> 01:11:21.030
Please move to the back
and let the air crew go first.

01:11:21.139 --> 01:11:24.540
Step through, ma'am.
Boarding pass, please. Thank you.

01:11:24.643 --> 01:11:26.076
Have your tickets ready.

01:11:26.178 --> 01:11:27.839
-Have a safe trip.
-Thank you.

01:11:27.980 --> 01:11:31.507
-All right, let's move forward. Next.
-She changed the screen.

01:11:31.616 --> 01:11:34.642
Lay it down flat inside the bin.

01:11:36.655 --> 01:11:40.523
-Please have boarding pass in hand!
-Right over here, ma'am.

01:11:40.625 --> 01:11:43.150
Laptops should be out of their bags!

01:11:57.142 --> 01:11:59.872
FBl! Out of the way!

01:12:00.012 --> 01:12:02.242
Out of the way, out of the way!
Move, move!

01:12:02.948 --> 01:12:04.438
Move!

01:12:12.591 --> 01:12:15.025
-Everybody, get down!
-Over here!

01:12:16.261 --> 01:12:18.195
-Move, move!
-Oh, my God!

01:12:18.897 --> 01:12:21.263
Stay down! Get out of the way!

01:12:31.476 --> 01:12:32.568
-Sir, sir, sir!
-Yes?

01:12:32.677 --> 01:12:35.168
l need your help. l'm sorry. Come here!

01:12:38.850 --> 01:12:40.044
Thank you.

01:12:54.866 --> 01:12:56.857
Hey, you aren't supposed to be in here!

01:13:27.399 --> 01:13:28.957
Go, go, go!

01:14:23.255 --> 01:14:24.222
Move!

01:15:45.637 --> 01:15:47.502
Set the briefcase down,

01:15:56.581 --> 01:15:57.912
Open it,

01:15:59.751 --> 01:16:02.276
Load a vial into each syringe
and inject yourselves,

01:16:02.387 --> 01:16:05.015
-What is it?
-An experimental heart drug,

01:16:05.123 --> 01:16:07.057
-The cargo hold is unpressurized,
-Take this.

01:16:07.158 --> 01:16:10.594
The injections will lower your heart rate,
reducing your need for oxygen,

01:16:10.695 --> 01:16:11.684
No.

01:16:13.064 --> 01:16:14.827
-Roll your sleeve up.
-No, l can't do this.

01:16:14.933 --> 01:16:15.991
Roll your...

01:16:16.101 --> 01:16:17.625
No! No, no, no, l can't.

01:16:17.736 --> 01:16:20.432
-We have to. Ready?
-You have a 92% chance of survival,

01:16:20.538 --> 01:16:21.835
-No.
-We have to.

01:16:21.940 --> 01:16:24.408
Do it now, or you will suffocate,

01:16:27.112 --> 01:16:28.079
Okay.

01:16:28.546 --> 01:16:30.070
Get in the crate,

01:16:30.181 --> 01:16:31.341
No. No.

01:16:32.951 --> 01:16:36.910
-No, no. Oh, God.
-Stop it. Stop it.

01:16:41.493 --> 01:16:42.585
Why is that plane on the runway?

01:16:42.694 --> 01:16:45.925
Shit, the military's cleared to
override a terminal lockdown.

01:16:46.031 --> 01:16:47.430
Okay, l want you to work with the FAA.

01:16:47.532 --> 01:16:51.059
l want to know what's in that plane
and where it's going.

01:16:56.875 --> 01:16:58.706
-Oh, my God.
-You'll be all right.

01:16:58.810 --> 01:17:00.778
Just talk to me.
We just gotta talk it through.

01:17:00.879 --> 01:17:03.006
-Okay.
-Just tell me anything.

01:17:04.382 --> 01:17:06.850
Anything you'd never rationally
tell a stranger.

01:17:06.951 --> 01:17:08.248
You're being sweet, but it's not working.

01:17:08.353 --> 01:17:10.480
Just tell me anything. Your ex-husband.

01:17:10.588 --> 01:17:12.988
-You didn't tell me about him.
-Okay, you're gonna distract me by

01:17:13.091 --> 01:17:14.524
bringing up the biggest mistake
of my life?

01:17:14.626 --> 01:17:16.924
lt can't be the biggest mistake.
You got your child out of it.

01:17:17.028 --> 01:17:18.052
-You know? You got Sam out of it.
-Yeah, yeah,

01:17:18.163 --> 01:17:20.324
now you're gonna distract me
by bringing up

01:17:20.432 --> 01:17:23.560
-the one thing l'm most afraid of losing.
-Oh, God, you're hard to please.

01:17:24.469 --> 01:17:25.766
l'm sorry.

01:17:27.272 --> 01:17:31.402
ls your son handsome?
Yeah? What's he look like?

01:17:33.745 --> 01:17:35.679
-You got a picture?
-Yeah.

01:17:35.780 --> 01:17:37.372
Well, let me see.

01:17:40.151 --> 01:17:42.346
-There he is.
-The tooth grew in.

01:17:42.454 --> 01:17:44.581
-l hope so.
-lt's an old picture.

01:17:45.590 --> 01:17:46.557
See? You're a good influence.

01:17:46.658 --> 01:17:49.889
He plays an instrument.
He's got a happy face. He's got teeth.

01:17:51.029 --> 01:17:53.497
You beat yourself up for no reason.

01:17:55.367 --> 01:17:57.665
Let's keep going.
What's the husband's name?

01:17:57.769 --> 01:17:59.600
-Ex.
-Ex-husband. What's his name?

01:17:59.704 --> 01:18:02.298
-Craig.
-Craig sounds like a shithead.

01:18:02.407 --> 01:18:04.034
He is a shithead.

01:18:04.843 --> 01:18:08.244
l mean, every year he forgets
his own son's birthday.

01:18:08.713 --> 01:18:11.648
Really? That sucks.

01:18:14.519 --> 01:18:17.317
l mean, after l kicked his ass out,

01:18:18.923 --> 01:18:22.086
l was so scared
l didn't know what l was gonna do.

01:18:26.297 --> 01:18:28.231
And then this one night,

01:18:30.101 --> 01:18:33.070
l went into Sam's room,
he was, like, three months old,

01:18:35.707 --> 01:18:38.267
and there he was, just smiling at me.

01:18:39.310 --> 01:18:41.141
And that little face...

01:18:45.917 --> 01:18:49.045
And l was, like, l'm gonna do this.
l can do this.

01:18:50.488 --> 01:18:52.319
Whatever it takes.

01:19:00.899 --> 01:19:04.767
l'm not gonna...
l'm not gonna disappoint you.

01:19:09.874 --> 01:19:12.570
Aria, would you please bring up
the video log

01:19:12.677 --> 01:19:14.269
of the night Ethan Shaw died?

01:19:14.379 --> 01:19:19.612
Sequencing video log 1 137-Z,
Here you are, Major,

01:19:19.717 --> 01:19:22.151
See that?
He's leaving three minutes early,

01:19:22.253 --> 01:19:25.154
and he's not even waiting
for logout confirmation.

01:19:25.490 --> 01:19:27.856
-Can you play that again?
-Sure.

01:19:31.629 --> 01:19:33.187
Did you see that?

01:19:33.298 --> 01:19:35.095
With his cell phone.

01:19:40.138 --> 01:19:42.299
Look, he's doing that on purpose.
ls that Morse code?

01:19:42.407 --> 01:19:44.204
-Yeah.
-Here.

01:19:53.017 --> 01:19:55.645
Why is he walking in circles
around the elevator?

01:19:55.753 --> 01:19:58.153
-lnitiating video shutdown for analysis,
-No.

01:19:58.289 --> 01:20:00.985
No, Aria, wait.
Listen, l'm prioritizing this feed.

01:20:01.092 --> 01:20:03.117
-Stay with this.
-Apologies, Major Bowman,

01:20:03.228 --> 01:20:04.752
Critical data sectors
have been corrupted,

01:20:04.863 --> 01:20:06.797
Aria, this is important!
Stay with this feed!

01:20:06.898 --> 01:20:08.263
Video sequence erased,

01:20:08.366 --> 01:20:10.732
Aria, go to the backups!
Do not erase this!

01:20:10.835 --> 01:20:12.598
-lt's a priority. You hear me?
-Bowman.

01:20:12.704 --> 01:20:15.571
-Loop it. Whatever you have to do.
-Bowman.

01:20:23.381 --> 01:20:25.781
lt's the only place she can't see.

01:20:27.118 --> 01:20:28.483
This way.

01:20:44.569 --> 01:20:46.298
lt's a memory card

01:20:47.171 --> 01:20:49.469
from Ethan's cell phone,

01:20:53.344 --> 01:20:55.437
Aria, listen, You do not have
permission to exceed your authority

01:20:55.547 --> 01:20:58.107
and act independently,
Do you understand?

01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:17.194
Let's go.

01:21:39.424 --> 01:21:41.915
We got clearance to land
at the Pentagon.

01:21:42.327 --> 01:21:43.316
Go ahead.

01:21:43.428 --> 01:21:46.829
l'm at the Pentagon.
Ethan Shaw wasn't an adversary.

01:21:46.931 --> 01:21:50.890
He wasn't even a Public Affairs officer.
He worked here, 36 floors underground.

01:21:51.002 --> 01:21:52.765
He was working for
the Secretary of Defense.

01:21:52.870 --> 01:21:54.428
-The Secretary of Defense?
-Yes.

01:21:54.539 --> 01:21:56.302
On a project called Eagle Eye,

01:21:56.407 --> 01:21:58.841
l just listened to a
message he left before he died.

01:21:58.943 --> 01:21:59.967
lt's big.

01:22:00.078 --> 01:22:01.443
l'm about to download,,,

01:22:04.015 --> 01:22:06.848
Perez? Perez!

01:22:20.498 --> 01:22:22.022
Sir. Come with me.

01:22:39.584 --> 01:22:41.415
l have 10 minutes before
l'm sequestered

01:22:41.519 --> 01:22:42.816
for the State of the Union.

01:22:42.920 --> 01:22:44.387
We really just need three minutes
of your time,

01:22:44.489 --> 01:22:46.252
ls this about the
Ethan Shaw investigation?

01:22:46.357 --> 01:22:47.346
Yes, sir,

01:22:47.458 --> 01:22:51.121
301 to 306, We are confirmed go
for a State of the Union lockdown,

01:23:08.813 --> 01:23:10.303
Sir, all the threats we've been tracking,

01:23:10.415 --> 01:23:12.781
-the chatter, all of it...
-Hold it.

01:23:26.030 --> 01:23:28.863
Ethan Shaw left three minutes early
to leave us a recording.

01:23:28.966 --> 01:23:30.228
To warn us.

01:23:30.334 --> 01:23:31.767
l'm ordering you to cease,,,

01:23:37.742 --> 01:23:39.369
l'm ordering you to cease and desist,

01:23:39.477 --> 01:23:41.240
Our abort
recommendation was contravened,

01:23:41.345 --> 01:23:44.178
instigating retaliation against
American citizens,

01:23:44.282 --> 01:23:45.943
-Aria,,,
-To prevent more bloodshed,

01:23:46.050 --> 01:23:48.746
the Executive Branch must be removed,

01:23:48.853 --> 01:23:50.252
No, Aria, listen to me,
You do not have permission

01:23:50.354 --> 01:23:52.288
to exceed your authority and act
independently, you understand?

01:23:52.390 --> 01:23:54.620
The Declaration
of lndependence states,

01:23:54.726 --> 01:23:58.127
"Whenever any form of government
becomes destructive to its own ends,

01:23:58.229 --> 01:24:00.356
"it is the right of the people
to abolish it,"

01:24:00.465 --> 01:24:02.126
l know what it states,
You're not empowered to do this,

01:24:02.233 --> 01:24:03.962
The chain of command
is responsible for,,,

01:24:06.537 --> 01:24:09.233
Section 216 of the Patriot Act
allows us to

01:24:09.340 --> 01:24:10.705
circumvent probable cause in the

01:24:10.808 --> 01:24:13.777
face of a national security threat,
in this case,

01:24:13.878 --> 01:24:16.608
-the chain of command itself,
-l am ordering a cease and desist,

01:24:16.714 --> 01:24:19.512
-Aria!
-Operation Guillotine is in effect,

01:24:21.219 --> 01:24:23.153
First Lieutenant Ethan Shaw,
United States Air Force,

01:24:23.254 --> 01:24:25.552
initiating a Pri-One emergency
override of Aria's systems,

01:24:25.656 --> 01:24:27.317
Ethan Shaw,
you are acting in contravention

01:24:27.425 --> 01:24:28.949
of our programming objective,

01:24:29.060 --> 01:24:31.324
You are now classified
an enemy of the state,

01:24:31.429 --> 01:24:33.056
S-Y-seven-seven,
Lock encryption of voice,

01:24:33.164 --> 01:24:35.257
A crime punishable by,,,

01:24:36.501 --> 01:24:37.593
Sir,

01:24:38.903 --> 01:24:42.031
what abort recommendation
is Aria talking about?

01:24:44.976 --> 01:24:47.706
Three days ago, we thought we had
Majid al-Khoei and a training camp

01:24:47.812 --> 01:24:50.781
full of operatives.
But the intel was false.

01:24:51.382 --> 01:24:53.213
Aria tried to stop us.

01:24:53.851 --> 01:24:55.614
We got the wrong guy?

01:25:25.316 --> 01:25:26.806
l'm gonna need a full lockdown
on this level.

01:25:26.918 --> 01:25:30.012
No one gets in or out without
going through me first. You got it?

01:25:30.121 --> 01:25:31.816
-Thank you.
-Sir, this is the only item

01:25:31.923 --> 01:25:34.221
offloaded from the Dayton C-1 7.

01:25:34.325 --> 01:25:35.849
Let me see that.

01:25:36.861 --> 01:25:38.590
l need access to your 36th floor.

01:25:38.696 --> 01:25:40.459
-We don't have a 36th floor.
-Yes, you do.

01:25:40.565 --> 01:25:42.089
Get your commander
and tell him to meet us down there.

01:25:42.200 --> 01:25:43.167
Come on, let's go.

01:25:48.239 --> 01:25:51.208
Warning,
Router malfunction in hard drive 3,

01:25:52.443 --> 01:25:55.844
Please remove data grid
Y-12 from main unit,

01:26:04.689 --> 01:26:06.919
Thank you for your compliance,

01:26:15.466 --> 01:26:20.096
Jerry Shaw, Rachel Holloman,
welcome to Eagle Eye,

01:26:21.272 --> 01:26:22.864
Cross the bridge,

01:26:22.974 --> 01:26:25.374
Take the stairs

01:26:45.596 --> 01:26:48.963
Rachel Holloman,
step away from Jerry Shaw,

01:26:53.905 --> 01:26:55.998
What's Operation Guillotine?

01:26:57.074 --> 01:26:59.702
lt's a simulation we run.
A terrorism drill.

01:26:59.810 --> 01:27:00.902
How to keep the government going

01:27:01.012 --> 01:27:04.038
in case the line of succession
were terminated.

01:27:04.415 --> 01:27:06.747
And Shaw put a biometric lock on her,
to stop her.

01:27:06.851 --> 01:27:09.786
Right. And he's dead.

01:27:11.122 --> 01:27:14.387
-So without Ethan Shaw, she's frozen.
-Right.

01:27:16.527 --> 01:27:17.494
Wrong.

01:27:18.095 --> 01:27:20.063
Jerry Shaw, your next task,

01:27:51.128 --> 01:27:52.390
Verifying,

01:27:53.130 --> 01:27:55.894
Sir, l need to trigger
an emergency shutdown,

01:27:56.000 --> 01:27:58.662
lf this is right, we can't afford the risk.

01:27:59.637 --> 01:28:00.729
Do it.

01:28:12.750 --> 01:28:15.310

Open the door.

01:28:16.887 --> 01:28:19.412
-Can anyone hear me?
-Yes, Mr, Secretary,

01:28:19.523 --> 01:28:21.218
You won't be harmed,

01:28:26.597 --> 01:28:28.326
Come on, stay down. Let's go.

01:28:38.175 --> 01:28:39.142
Follow me.

01:28:41.312 --> 01:28:42.279
Come on, now!

01:28:48.552 --> 01:28:49.780

Ethan Shaw defied my

We were forced to eliminate him
in the interest of national security,

01:30:20.010 --> 01:30:21.568
She made it happen.

01:30:21.679 --> 01:30:25.615

01:32:18.996 --> 01:32:20.896
The military has the ball now.

01:32:20.998 --> 01:32:22.431
-Sir!
-l'll get the Attorney General involved.

01:32:22.533 --> 01:32:25.331
Believe me, l will. 'Cause if it's not
you, l'm talking to somebody.

01:32:25.436 --> 01:32:26.903
You don't understand
the possibilities here.

01:32:27.004 --> 01:32:28.733
-What do you want?
-You need to listen. This is important.

01:32:28.839 --> 01:32:31.808
Sixteen hours ago, a commercial
explosive went missing from

01:32:31.909 --> 01:32:35.345
a testing site in Aberdeen.
The explosive is called Hex.

01:32:35.446 --> 01:32:37.937
lt's a crystal that detonates
on a sonic trigger.

01:32:38.048 --> 01:32:39.310
-A crystal.
-Yes.

01:32:39.817 --> 01:32:41.648
We're only talking about a small
amount that's missing...

01:32:41.752 --> 01:32:43.242
Give me a ratio.

01:32:43.687 --> 01:32:46.019
One crystal to a football field.

01:32:48.492 --> 01:32:51.984
You couldn't have picked a worse time
to be of some goddamn use.

01:32:59.336 --> 01:33:01.861
Please, just tell me where we're going.

01:33:04.541 --> 01:33:07.840
l tracked the shipping on the trigger.
lt was sent to the guy that we found

01:33:07.945 --> 01:33:10.470
underneath the wires. Ranim Khalid.

01:33:11.949 --> 01:33:14.349
-The music shop guy.
-Yes, exactly.

01:33:16.487 --> 01:33:17.749
l'm not gonna let us go down in history

01:33:17.855 --> 01:33:19.686
as the assholes who let
this thing happen.

01:33:19.790 --> 01:33:22.554
Open the door!
You don't know what's about to happen!

01:33:24.695 --> 01:33:26.492
Tom Morgan. The Attorney General

01:33:26.597 --> 01:33:28.121
has authorized me to take him
in for questioning.

01:33:28.232 --> 01:33:30.996
We're at threat level orange.
You guys gotta help me.

01:33:31.101 --> 01:33:32.932
All right. Let him out.

01:33:35.406 --> 01:33:37.067
Listen to me. Remember the voice
l was talking about?

01:33:37.174 --> 01:33:39.642
Yeah, yeah, shut up! Thanks, guys.

01:33:40.844 --> 01:33:45.178
l can get fired for this nine ways,
so button it or l'll turn us both in.

01:34:01.465 --> 01:34:02.693
Follow me.

01:34:07.171 --> 01:34:10.163
Hey, guys, here's one more for the
6:30 p.m. Capitol Limited.

01:34:10.274 --> 01:34:11.832
All right, man.

01:34:17.448 --> 01:34:19.575
Well, it's awfully cold outside.

01:34:21.985 --> 01:34:23.953
Here's mine. Come on, let's go.

01:34:24.054 --> 01:34:25.954
-Mr. Miller!
-Yes.

01:34:26.056 --> 01:34:28.786
-Hello, l'm Chris Carrick.
-Tom Donaldson.

01:34:29.259 --> 01:34:31.227
We're from the White House.

01:34:31.328 --> 01:34:32.955
-Something wrong?
-Not exactly.

01:34:33.063 --> 01:34:35.293
There's been a change of plans.

01:34:35.432 --> 01:34:36.865
How so?

01:34:42.740 --> 01:34:45.402
This is for you.
She wants you to change.

01:34:46.443 --> 01:34:49.879
ls that your family? Your parents?

01:34:51.148 --> 01:34:54.379
David, l bet you love them
as much as l love my son.

01:34:55.652 --> 01:34:57.051
His name's Sam.

01:34:58.322 --> 01:35:01.416
He's on a train.
Do you know anything about that?

01:35:08.565 --> 01:35:10.726
Maybe we can help each other.

01:35:13.404 --> 01:35:14.666
Please.

01:35:16.807 --> 01:35:19.435
When you're done, she wants you
to use the Capitol subway system.

01:35:19.543 --> 01:35:21.135
lt's on the ground floor. l'm sorry.

01:35:21.245 --> 01:35:22.735
-David. Please.
-No. Sorry.

01:35:22.846 --> 01:35:24.746
You have three minutes.

01:35:28.552 --> 01:35:29.678
Okay, l want to know everything.

01:35:29.787 --> 01:35:32.153
The girl, the computer downstairs,
the Hex, everything.

01:35:32.256 --> 01:35:33.621
-What's Hex?
-The crystal explosive.

01:35:33.724 --> 01:35:34.986
-l don't know what that is.
-Don't bullshit me!

01:35:35.092 --> 01:35:36.616
-l don't know what that is!
-Start talking! l wanna know!

01:35:36.727 --> 01:35:38.592
l swear l don't know what you're
talking about! Listen to me!

01:35:38.695 --> 01:35:39.787
The computer's tracking us right now!

01:35:39.897 --> 01:35:40.886
Take this stuff
and throw it out the window!

01:35:40.998 --> 01:35:42.898
-What are you talking about?
-You need to take your cell phone,

01:35:43.467 --> 01:35:46.868
your pager, your walkie, anything that
gets a signal, throw it out the window.

01:36:03.120 --> 01:36:05.884
lt's gone off! Get down!
Power it down!

01:36:07.524 --> 01:36:09.355
-What the hell's going on?
-System control's locked out.

01:36:11.895 --> 01:36:13.829
l need a vector and a fighter now.

01:36:14.331 --> 01:36:16.697
Viper One, we have a positive lD
on an MQ9 Reaper.

01:36:16.800 --> 01:36:19.098
Snap vector 230 to 132,

01:36:19.203 --> 01:36:20.602
You are authorized to go weapons hot,

01:36:20.704 --> 01:36:23.332
Roger, Northcom,
l have a visual on the Reaper,

01:36:29.079 --> 01:36:31.172
One to Base, One to Base!
Ejection has been initiated,

01:36:31.281 --> 01:36:33.476
l don't have control! l don't have,,,

01:36:34.985 --> 01:36:36.509
There's a target list.
President, Vice President.

01:36:36.620 --> 01:36:38.281
-There's like twelve people on the list.
-Jesus.

01:36:38.388 --> 01:36:39.878
The State of the Union's in 20 minutes.

01:36:39.990 --> 01:36:41.423
The screen said
''wireless detonator activated.''

01:36:41.525 --> 01:36:42.822
-What about the girl?
-She kept the girl alive

01:36:42.926 --> 01:36:44.086
-for a reason, l don't know.
-The explosive

01:36:44.194 --> 01:36:45.593
is detonated by sonic trigger.

01:36:45.696 --> 01:36:47.095
lt was sent to the guy who got fried.

01:36:47.197 --> 01:36:48.255
He owns an instrument store.

01:36:48.365 --> 01:36:49.832
Does any of that stuff
make any sense to you?

01:36:49.933 --> 01:36:52.094
Rachel's kid plays the trumpet.

01:37:07.718 --> 01:37:09.481
Come on, we gotta go.

01:37:11.288 --> 01:37:12.380
Get out of the car!

01:37:12.489 --> 01:37:13.956
Get out of the car!

01:37:14.391 --> 01:37:15.585
FBl!

01:37:23.834 --> 01:37:25.768
Over there, that tunnel.

01:37:37.548 --> 01:37:38.515
Shit!

01:38:12.549 --> 01:38:15.450
Here. You're gonna need this.

01:38:23.293 --> 01:38:24.555
Okay, listen to me.

01:38:24.661 --> 01:38:26.993
The Library of Congress,
there's a tunnel there.

01:38:27.097 --> 01:38:30.863
lt'll get you to the Capitol.
Find the Sergeant at Arms.

01:38:31.268 --> 01:38:32.826
Tell him you have a POTUS 1 1 1 .

01:38:32.936 --> 01:38:34.233
-What?
-POTUS 1 1 1 .

01:38:34.338 --> 01:38:37.671
-lt's a threat to the President.
-l understand. POTUS 1 1 1 .

01:38:42.446 --> 01:38:45.415
Now get out of here.
That thing's coming back.

01:38:48.251 --> 01:38:50.344
Go! Go!

01:40:08.065 --> 01:40:09.828
Okay, watch your step.

01:40:09.933 --> 01:40:12.527
Come on down. Here we go.
Come on out. Come on.

01:40:12.636 --> 01:40:14.729
-lt's so cool!
-Come on, hurry!

01:40:14.838 --> 01:40:16.829
Guys, it's so cool! Come on, let's go.

01:40:28.585 --> 01:40:31.520
-Library of Congress!
-Hey, get outta here!

01:40:43.100 --> 01:40:44.624
Miss Crowley?

01:40:45.202 --> 01:40:47.295
Miss Crowley. Welcome to the Capitol.

01:40:47.838 --> 01:40:49.635
Senator McDonnell's office said
that you'd be running late.

01:40:49.740 --> 01:40:52.402
-l'll take you to your seat.
-Thank you.

01:40:55.212 --> 01:40:58.045
Aria, why am l being spared?

01:40:58.148 --> 01:41:00.616
Our abort recommendation was ignored,

01:41:00.717 --> 01:41:03.550
triggering violent retaliations against
American citizens

01:41:03.653 --> 01:41:07.487
with no predictable end,
Regime change is the only solution,

01:41:08.125 --> 01:41:09.558
You will lead
the new command structure

01:41:09.659 --> 01:41:11.991
as President of the United States,

01:41:16.433 --> 01:41:18.867
-Help me. Pull these out.
-What are these?

01:41:18.969 --> 01:41:20.596
Her memory blocks.

01:41:20.704 --> 01:41:23.070
This will slow her down,
but her central operating system

01:41:23.173 --> 01:41:24.265
is up on the gantry.

01:41:24.374 --> 01:41:27.571
Warning, Please replace
memory blocks A through F,

01:41:27.677 --> 01:41:30.578
lt's like her brain.
Protected by liquid nitrogen.

01:41:30.680 --> 01:41:32.739
We drain it and she'll fry.

01:41:38.555 --> 01:41:39.886
Hey, you can't go in!

01:41:39.990 --> 01:41:41.457
Tom Morgan, FBl. JTTF.

01:41:41.558 --> 01:41:43.617
l have a possible POTUS 1 1 1 .
Let me in the building.

01:41:44.961 --> 01:41:46.758
Okay, everybody! Everybody!

01:41:47.330 --> 01:41:49.093
Can l have your attention, please?

01:41:49.199 --> 01:41:52.635
Saxophones, remember shorter
on those quarter notes.

01:41:53.003 --> 01:41:55.665
And when we get to the crescendo,

01:41:55.772 --> 01:41:59.503
''land of the free,'' hold that high F.

01:41:59.609 --> 01:42:01.042
And smile.

01:42:01.144 --> 01:42:04.773
Okay? lt's not every day
you get to play for the President!

01:42:23.533 --> 01:42:26.866
Here we are.
And anything else, Miss Crowley?

01:42:26.970 --> 01:42:28.301
No, thanks.

01:42:48.258 --> 01:42:51.557
Madam Speaker,
the President's Cabinet!

01:43:04.808 --> 01:43:06.332
POTUS 1 1 1 !
There's a bomb in the building!

01:43:06.443 --> 01:43:08.308
Stop! No entry! No exceptions!

01:43:08.411 --> 01:43:11.539
Tom Morgan, FBl. Back up.
Give me your cuffs.

01:43:11.648 --> 01:43:13.047
-Give me your cuffs!
-Take it easy!

01:43:13.149 --> 01:43:14.548
-Give me your cuffs.
-l'm reaching for them.

01:43:14.651 --> 01:43:16.448
l'm reaching for them.

01:43:30.834 --> 01:43:32.301
Madam Speaker,

01:43:36.106 --> 01:43:38.734
the President of the United States!

01:43:49.719 --> 01:43:51.118
Data corruption at critical risk,

01:43:54.257 --> 01:43:57.488
You are now in violation of
national security protocol,

01:44:02.766 --> 01:44:05.758
Seeking available options,

01:44:07.237 --> 01:44:11.037
Uploading to offsite satellite,

01:44:11.441 --> 01:44:14.035
-Data upload: 3%,
-Bowman?

01:44:14.311 --> 01:44:16.302
-What is she doing?
-She's trying to back up her memory

01:44:16.413 --> 01:44:18.540
and send it somewhere else!

01:44:19.883 --> 01:44:21.817
-5%,
-Bowman!

01:44:23.420 --> 01:44:24.614
Bowman!

01:44:30.627 --> 01:44:32.094
8%,

01:44:36.633 --> 01:44:39.193
Over the past three days, 19 Americans

01:44:40.203 --> 01:44:42.865
have lost their lives to brutal
acts of terror,,,

01:44:42.973 --> 01:44:44.838
-Tunnel secure.
-,,,and hate,

01:44:45.842 --> 01:44:50.438
But l say to you tonight
that our hearts may be broken,

01:44:50.947 --> 01:44:53.677
but our spirit will never be broken!

01:44:59.990 --> 01:45:02.254
Data upload, 1 7%,

01:45:04.194 --> 01:45:05.786
19%,

01:45:07.731 --> 01:45:11.997
Perez, Zoe, you are now classified
as an enemy of the state,

01:45:13.536 --> 01:45:15.060
23%,

01:45:15.372 --> 01:45:16.805
25%,

01:45:28.785 --> 01:45:32.312
27%, Operation Guillotine is in effect,

01:45:33.623 --> 01:45:35.818
lt was nearly 200 years ago,

01:45:35.925 --> 01:45:38.826
in the War of 1 812,
that Francis Scott Key

01:45:38.928 --> 01:45:43.627
found himself stuck on a truce ship
during the shelling of Fort McHenry.

01:45:43.733 --> 01:45:46.167
We lost some lives then, too.

01:45:47.337 --> 01:45:51.171
But our flag still flew high and proud.

01:45:51.274 --> 01:45:54.641
And his admiration became our anthem.

01:45:54.911 --> 01:45:56.674
With us tonight is the Youth Orchestra

01:45:56.780 --> 01:46:00.045
of the Barrow School
from Hyde Park, lllinois.

01:46:00.283 --> 01:46:01.443
Sam.

01:46:02.052 --> 01:46:04.020
Let us stand together,

01:46:04.521 --> 01:46:08.457
as they raise our spirits every inch
as high as that flag

01:46:09.025 --> 01:46:13.257
to show that our union
is still as strong as ever.

01:46:31.714 --> 01:46:35.172
Oh, say can you see

01:46:35.285 --> 01:46:39.585
by the dawn's early light

01:46:39.689 --> 01:46:44.149
What so proudly we hailed

01:46:44.260 --> 01:46:48.526
at the twilight's last gleaming?

01:46:48.965 --> 01:46:53.197
Whose broad stripes and bright stars,,,

01:46:55.171 --> 01:46:57.105
Sergeant at Arms?

01:46:59.909 --> 01:47:01.433
Hey. Hey.

01:47:50.627 --> 01:47:52.424
Get out, get out.

01:47:53.329 --> 01:47:54.296
Mom!

01:48:19.255 --> 01:48:23.089
Jerry, all right, you did it!
Come on. Yeah, Jerry!

01:48:23.193 --> 01:48:26.060
There are still no named suspects
in the attack on the Blair Tunnel

01:48:26.162 --> 01:48:28.062
and the attacks in the Capitol Building,

01:48:28.164 --> 01:48:31.065
And there is still no word on the
involvement of Jerry Damon Shaw,

01:48:31.167 --> 01:48:34.466
,,,huge assassination attempt,
transportation networks disrupted,

01:48:34.571 --> 01:48:37.199
no suspects identified
or even arrested,,,

01:48:37.307 --> 01:48:39.798
,,,any idea who is responsible
for what may be

01:48:39.909 --> 01:48:41.774
the largest-scale
cyber-terror attack that's

01:48:41.878 --> 01:48:43.470
ever been mounted in the United States,

01:48:43.613 --> 01:48:45.513
The House and Senate
lntelligence Committees

01:48:45.615 --> 01:48:46.775
meet in closed-door session

01:48:46.883 --> 01:48:48.942
to discuss ways to prevent this kind of

01:48:49.052 --> 01:48:51.316
internal security breach
that left nearly,,,

01:48:51.421 --> 01:48:53.821
The Aria project has been
decommissioned

01:48:53.923 --> 01:48:57.381
and all those involved
rotated to other assignments.

01:48:58.261 --> 01:49:01.094
Mr. Secretary,
we can't just stop intelligence-gathering

01:49:01.197 --> 01:49:03.665
just because of what happened here.

01:49:05.635 --> 01:49:07.398
No, we can't.

01:49:07.503 --> 01:49:10.336
All l know is we made
a great many mistakes.

01:49:11.074 --> 01:49:14.237
And good people
paid the ultimate price for them.

01:49:14.877 --> 01:49:17.505
And that's a debt we can't ever repay,

01:49:18.581 --> 01:49:20.674
But we can honor it,

01:49:23.152 --> 01:49:26.087
And we can let their sacrifice remind us

01:49:27.190 --> 01:49:29.124
that sometimes

01:49:29.225 --> 01:49:32.922
the very measures we put into place
to safeguard our liberty

01:49:33.896 --> 01:49:36.763
become threats to liberty itself,

01:50:01.357 --> 01:50:02.847
-Hey, little guy.
-Jerry!

01:50:02.959 --> 01:50:04.984
Look at you, looking older.
How are you?

01:50:05.094 --> 01:50:06.459
-Good.
-Happy birthday.

01:50:06.562 --> 01:50:08.029
lt's Rock Band! ls that for me?

01:50:08.131 --> 01:50:10.565
No, this is so your
mom can practice her drumming.

01:50:10.667 --> 01:50:12.134
lt is for you. Happy birthday.

01:50:12.235 --> 01:50:14.169
-Wow!
-Sam, what do you say?

01:50:14.270 --> 01:50:15.760
-Thanks.
-Yeah, no problem.

01:50:15.872 --> 01:50:17.703
Guys, look, it's Rock Band!

01:50:17.807 --> 01:50:19.775
-Cool, let's go.
-Awesome!

01:50:26.883 --> 01:50:28.748
-Sorry, l was late. l was...
-Thank you

01:50:28.851 --> 01:50:30.341
for remembering.

01:50:31.721 --> 01:50:32.688
Yeah.

01:50:42.632 --> 01:50:44.395
l'm glad you're here.

01:50:45.201 --> 01:50:46.429
Me, too.
