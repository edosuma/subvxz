00:00.273 --> 00:02.288
Previously on "Secrets and Lies"...

00:02.308 --> 00:03.939
You are the prime suspect.

00:03.959 --> 00:07.615
She had a baby, and she took a
bunch of cash out of my savings.

00:07.635 --> 00:10.410
It's an extortion letter.
You were being blackmailed.

00:10.430 --> 00:12.868
Where were you two weeks ago
on Wednesday night?

00:12.888 --> 00:16.510
I was watching my wife have dinner
with her ex-boyfriend, Shane Campbell.

00:16.530 --> 00:18.486
- No! No!
- Hey! Hey!

00:18.506 --> 00:20.866
- Stay out of it!
- Was this the man that attacked you?

00:20.886 --> 00:21.906
That's him.

00:21.926 --> 00:23.964
You're lying to that cop.
Now you're lying to me.

00:23.984 --> 00:25.219
- What are you hiding?
- Nothing.

00:25.239 --> 00:27.420
- Get out.
- Kate's assistant, Liam,

00:27.440 --> 00:28.847
hasn't come back.

00:38.554 --> 00:40.228
Son of a bitch.

00:42.995 --> 00:44.360
Who are you?

00:45.172 --> 00:47.386
You scare pretty easy for a killer.

00:47.455 --> 00:48.841
You do your wife?

00:48.937 --> 00:50.356
What the hell do you want?

00:50.823 --> 00:52.993
- Did you kill your wife?
- No.

00:55.183 --> 00:56.461
Did you?

01:00.813 --> 01:02.205
Where's Liam?

01:03.670 --> 01:05.817
- Where's Liam?!
- I don't know.

01:06.619 --> 01:08.161
He stopped coming to work.

01:08.181 --> 01:09.541
- When?
- About a week ago.

01:09.609 --> 01:12.610
He hasn't been in since Kate died.

01:19.459 --> 01:21.252
Why are you looking for Liam?

01:21.354 --> 01:22.877
I'm not.

01:25.576 --> 01:28.392
I'm looking for her.

01:28.412 --> 01:29.994
How did you get that picture?

01:30.063 --> 01:32.063
It was your party.

01:32.131 --> 01:35.432
- Who'd she come with? Her name is Carly.
- I don't know.

01:35.452 --> 01:37.767
- She's 19.
- Why are you looking for her?

01:37.787 --> 01:39.469
- Where's Liam?
- I said I don't know.

01:39.537 --> 01:40.703
I think you do.

01:43.575 --> 01:45.641
Too bad.

01:45.677 --> 01:48.511
The last time I saw you,
you beat up a friend of mine.

01:48.546 --> 01:51.481
Even if I knew where Liam was,
I wouldn't give him over to you.

01:53.451 --> 01:55.351
Dumb and brave.

01:55.371 --> 01:57.152
I like you, Eric.

02:02.616 --> 02:04.293
Wait.

02:07.938 --> 02:09.999
How did you get that photo?

02:10.687 --> 02:13.501
Your wife sent it to me
right before she died.

02:16.773 --> 02:21.452
Synced and corrected by johnyd13

02:25.191 --> 02:26.981
I understand that you can now identify

02:27.001 --> 02:28.648
the young woman in this photo.

02:28.668 --> 02:30.655
I know her name. It's Carly.

02:30.757 --> 02:32.958
I'll need her contact information.

02:33.060 --> 02:36.794
Okay, well, you'll have to ask
the guy who beat up Neil Oliver,

02:36.897 --> 02:39.197
then broke into Liam Connors'
apartment, and carries a gun.

02:39.299 --> 02:41.799
- You... you have a sketch of him.
- I'm doing my job.

02:41.902 --> 02:43.401
I don't need you to do it for me.

02:43.503 --> 02:45.535
Okay, well, whoever he is,
he is looking for Liam.

02:45.637 --> 02:47.537
He is dangerous, and he's committed.

02:47.639 --> 02:49.073
Aren't you supposed
to protect and serve?

02:49.175 --> 02:51.141
What exactly would you like me to do?

02:51.244 --> 02:52.676
Find Liam.

02:52.745 --> 02:54.178
Maybe he saw who killed my wife.

02:54.280 --> 02:56.113
Maybe... maybe he's in trouble.

02:56.182 --> 02:59.083
What makes you so sure
that Liam's missing?

02:59.680 --> 03:01.285
His apartment was tossed,

03:01.387 --> 03:05.955
and... he hasn't been to
work since Kate died.

03:06.091 --> 03:08.424
Maybe he quit and just
packed in a hurry.

03:11.303 --> 03:14.898
- This is a waste of time.
- Attrition, Mr. Warner.

03:15.331 --> 03:16.332
What?

03:16.434 --> 03:20.135
Your guests were led past
Kate's body in a pool of blood.

03:20.237 --> 03:23.317
It's a miracle anybody
went back to work at all.

03:24.836 --> 03:26.508
We're a family.

03:26.610 --> 03:28.911
Still, most people don't come
that close to violence

03:29.013 --> 03:30.478
and remain unscathed.

03:31.064 --> 03:33.812
You seem to be handling it rather well.

03:35.090 --> 03:37.051
I don't have a choice, Detective.

03:37.153 --> 03:38.819
Your employees do.

03:39.610 --> 03:41.655
Thank you for coming in
and doing your civic duty.

03:48.016 --> 03:49.297
I made a mistake.

03:49.399 --> 03:52.322
Then call a lawyer
you'll listen to. I'm busy.

03:56.400 --> 03:58.338
Kate's assistant went missing,

03:58.407 --> 04:00.473
and when I went looking for him,

04:00.575 --> 04:03.001
I was confronted by a guy with a gun.

04:03.794 --> 04:06.512
The same guy who beat up Neil.

04:07.019 --> 04:08.278
You okay?

04:09.635 --> 04:11.583
Then call a lawyer.

04:14.455 --> 04:17.259
Mandy, I'm sorry.

04:18.826 --> 04:20.759
You always do this.

04:21.140 --> 04:25.331
The puppy-dog eyes and the
earnest apology, and I give in.

04:25.935 --> 04:28.333
- Well, not this time.
- Okay.

04:28.435 --> 04:31.510
I'm used to being the guy
who knows what to do...

04:31.530 --> 04:33.104
The guy other people listen to...

04:33.139 --> 04:36.643
The guy whose shoulder you cry on.

04:36.663 --> 04:38.536
That was a long time ago.

04:38.556 --> 04:41.437
Amanda, you're my kid sister.

04:42.750 --> 04:45.431
Sometimes I forget you're not a kid.

04:45.451 --> 04:47.917
You have to know
there's no one I trust more.

04:48.020 --> 04:49.602
What happened?

04:49.867 --> 04:52.822
I told Cornell about it,
and she brushed me off.

04:52.924 --> 04:54.954
You talked to her alone?

04:55.068 --> 04:57.060
- Yeah.
- Okay.

05:01.532 --> 05:04.367
- That's it?
- What do you want me to say?

05:04.469 --> 05:07.269
I have told you over and
over again what not to do.

05:07.372 --> 05:09.305
Take my advice or don't.

05:09.407 --> 05:12.583
But the ones who don't
usually end up behind bars.

05:17.677 --> 05:19.147
Mandy...

05:20.188 --> 05:21.749
I'm really sorry.

05:24.260 --> 05:26.233
Mm.

05:27.724 --> 05:30.125
Write down everything
you said to that woman,

05:30.227 --> 05:31.893
and don't leave anything out.

05:31.995 --> 05:33.325
Okay.

05:50.867 --> 05:54.126
You can go with this officer here.

06:19.979 --> 06:22.174
So long, and good luck, bitch.

06:22.242 --> 06:25.377
Third time isn't always the charm, huh?

06:25.446 --> 06:28.518
See, there is no charm, Eric.

06:28.538 --> 06:31.205
Okay, a marriage,
plain and simple, is bondage

06:31.225 --> 06:35.011
designed to separate men from
their buddies and their money.

06:38.291 --> 06:40.002
You invited Kate?

06:40.022 --> 06:42.659
- Yeah.
- We had plans before you called.

06:42.728 --> 06:45.343
You know how long it takes to
get a reservation at red door.

06:45.363 --> 06:48.831
Yeah, nine years and three months
less than we've been friends.

06:48.933 --> 06:51.234
That's just a rough calculation.

06:51.336 --> 06:52.935
She's my wife now.

06:53.004 --> 06:55.727
- I can't bail on her.
- Ah, so it begins.

06:56.299 --> 06:57.640
Hey.

07:00.111 --> 07:01.210
Oh, hello.

07:01.278 --> 07:03.145
Neat... the way you like everything.

07:04.381 --> 07:06.449
I'm gonna go find some new friends.

07:07.851 --> 07:10.185
Amy left him.

07:10.287 --> 07:12.185
Aw, man.

07:12.205 --> 07:14.076
Why didn't you say something?

07:14.096 --> 07:16.678
- We had plans.
- No, no. You can't be one of those guys

07:16.698 --> 07:18.659
that abandons his buddies
after he gets married.

07:18.728 --> 07:20.617
You know he's sensitive.

07:21.005 --> 07:22.309
Neil?

07:23.128 --> 07:25.399
His third wife just dumped him.

07:25.502 --> 07:27.935
He's hurting. Go find him.

07:27.955 --> 07:29.737
I'll meet you at home later.

07:29.805 --> 07:31.805
- All right.
- No, I got it.

07:31.874 --> 07:33.274
You're gonna need your singles.

07:33.376 --> 07:34.741
Hm.

07:35.225 --> 07:36.697
Mm.

07:38.113 --> 07:40.502
- Love you.
- And I love you.

07:44.553 --> 07:46.085
May, did you get the...

07:46.121 --> 07:49.620
Liam's personnel file?
Right after you called. Yes.

07:50.792 --> 07:54.092
And I contacted the references
like you asked.

07:57.148 --> 07:59.588
But it isn't gonna be much help.

08:01.648 --> 08:04.703
- What are all your notations?
- Fabrications.

08:07.071 --> 08:09.207
He lied about all of this?

08:09.567 --> 08:11.676
Y-you marked his name.
He lied about his name?

08:11.778 --> 08:14.945
Well, the name he gave matches the
social, but neither of them...

08:15.048 --> 08:17.615
Belong to the kid we hired.

08:18.154 --> 08:19.384
This is bad.

08:19.486 --> 08:21.286
Have you told my father about this?

08:21.388 --> 08:22.987
I thought you'd want to.

08:23.089 --> 08:26.323
Bottom line, May.

08:26.870 --> 08:29.660
Is anything on this
résumé actually true?

08:29.761 --> 08:33.630
Well, I did confirm that a boy
by the name of Liam Connors,

08:33.698 --> 08:35.236
who'd be about 20 now,

08:35.256 --> 08:37.767
went to Watauga High School in Boone,

08:37.869 --> 08:39.436
just like it says on the résumé.

08:39.538 --> 08:41.037
- In Boone?
- Yes.

08:41.139 --> 08:43.539
But that boy died in a car accident,

08:43.640 --> 08:46.883
and I just submitted Liam
for a background check,

08:47.244 --> 08:50.913
but the agency told me
that Kate already ran one...

08:51.015 --> 08:52.699
Before she hired him.

09:00.038 --> 09:03.191
Kate knew it was all lies,
but she hired him anyway.

09:03.517 --> 09:06.918
I don't understand why
in the world she would do that.

09:11.735 --> 09:14.035
I might have some idea.

09:19.061 --> 09:20.452
You have a minute?

09:21.782 --> 09:25.097
I won't accept your
resignation, Eric. I can't.

09:25.117 --> 09:27.486
Dad, I need to talk to you about Kate.

09:30.264 --> 09:32.805
Kate's assistant, Liam,

09:33.502 --> 09:35.749
made up information on his résumé.

09:36.172 --> 09:38.710
Lots of people pad their CVs.

09:38.779 --> 09:42.091
What did he lie about?
Education? Work history? What?

09:42.602 --> 09:44.549
Everything.

09:46.386 --> 09:51.356
So you're saying that a man
that we know nothing about

09:51.458 --> 09:55.860
has direct access to our investors
confidential credit information?

09:56.249 --> 09:57.362
Yes.

09:57.645 --> 10:00.095
How did that get past Kate?

10:00.597 --> 10:03.067
It didn't. Kate knew.

10:03.087 --> 10:07.337
Why would she be so irresponsible
as to put our company at risk like that?

10:08.183 --> 10:09.866
To be near her son.

10:11.637 --> 10:15.080
What we know for sure is that
they both were from Boone.

10:15.100 --> 10:16.474
Liam's around the right age.

10:16.494 --> 10:18.948
He could be the son that
she gave up for adoption.

10:19.017 --> 10:20.783
Kate let a wolf in the henhouse.

10:21.660 --> 10:25.815
Biology alone does not excuse such
an enormous lapse in judgment.

10:26.009 --> 10:27.823
What lengths haven't you gone to for me?

10:27.925 --> 10:30.093
I know you. I have a
basis to make that call.

10:30.161 --> 10:33.731
- Kate was my wife, and I knew her.
- Maybe you didn't.

10:34.083 --> 10:37.220
Maybe none of us knew her
as well as we thought.

10:37.968 --> 10:40.194
Where is Liam? I need to talk to him.

10:40.214 --> 10:41.536
He's gone.

10:42.976 --> 10:44.640
This is my problem.

10:44.825 --> 10:47.689
If he did anything wrong,
I'll take care of it.

11:31.052 --> 11:32.726
What are you doing?

11:33.281 --> 11:34.486
Putting out a fire.

11:35.030 --> 11:36.355
I figured.

11:36.457 --> 11:38.190
The old man looks pissed.

11:38.792 --> 11:40.224
Let me help.

11:40.326 --> 11:41.709
You can't.

11:41.921 --> 11:43.561
Was it something I did?

11:43.629 --> 11:46.397
No. Uh, it's Kate.

11:46.925 --> 11:47.965
That's...

11:48.440 --> 11:50.961
No, she didn't make mistakes, Eric.

11:50.981 --> 11:53.371
I mean, she went over
every document with a loupe...

11:53.440 --> 11:55.173
Used colored tabs, recorded notes,

11:55.193 --> 11:56.740
and wrote them down just in case...

11:56.809 --> 11:58.875
Created calendars, tickler files.

11:58.895 --> 12:02.079
I mean, it sounds like fun,
but, really, it's not.

12:02.181 --> 12:04.948
Kate gave Liam the benefit of the
doubt, and she shouldn't have.

12:05.016 --> 12:06.421
Hmm. What have you got?

12:06.441 --> 12:08.618
Files Kate pulled to look into.

12:08.720 --> 12:10.995
The last stuff that she was working on.

12:11.154 --> 12:13.390
She's got a voicemail.

12:15.722 --> 12:17.893
You have two new voice messages.

12:17.995 --> 12:19.661
First message.

12:19.730 --> 12:21.197
Next message.

12:21.299 --> 12:24.032
Hello, Mrs. Warner.
It's Hal Markum, Fraud Division.

12:24.102 --> 12:25.867
We did have an unlimited credit card

12:25.936 --> 12:28.670
recently opened
under the name Keith Blair.

12:28.706 --> 12:30.939
When Mr. Blair called to say
he didn't apply for the card,

12:31.041 --> 12:32.540
we closed it immediately.

12:32.642 --> 12:34.909
If you have any other questions,
don't hesitate to call.

12:35.011 --> 12:36.444
Who... who's Keith Blair?

12:36.513 --> 12:38.045
End of messages.

12:38.148 --> 12:39.914
One of our investors.

12:42.935 --> 12:45.103
How bad is this gonna get?

13:12.713 --> 13:14.578
_

13:17.496 --> 13:20.119
What do you say we call it a night?

13:26.045 --> 13:27.225
It's just that you...

13:27.294 --> 13:29.594
You look so... so tired.

13:29.696 --> 13:31.095
Mm.

13:33.066 --> 13:35.733
- Maybe you should lie down.
- Oh.

13:35.835 --> 13:38.270
No, I'm not tired at all,
but you can go to bed if you want.

13:38.372 --> 13:39.936
I'll be in later.

13:40.005 --> 13:41.134
Mm.

13:42.241 --> 13:43.241
But, uh...

13:43.724 --> 13:45.108
Then I'll be asleep.

13:46.612 --> 13:47.944
And you don't want that.

13:48.544 --> 13:49.713
What's more important...

13:49.782 --> 13:53.717
Our bills getting paid
or your immediate happiness?

13:55.555 --> 13:59.247
I was thinking more about
your immediate happiness.

14:26.532 --> 14:28.911
_

14:58.789 --> 15:00.460
Has she been here?

15:00.812 --> 15:03.473
Our clientèle relies on discretion.

15:10.265 --> 15:13.065
Why don't you just tell me
what I need to know?

15:13.085 --> 15:16.295
No badge, so you must be the husband.

15:18.836 --> 15:20.261
She was here...

15:20.281 --> 15:21.599
With some guy.

15:26.773 --> 15:28.740
Sorry, man.

15:28.808 --> 15:30.074
Been in your shoes.

15:30.176 --> 15:32.510
This place is the only
thing I got to keep

15:32.579 --> 15:35.246
after I divorced my cheating bride.

15:35.785 --> 15:37.511
Is that the guy?

15:38.817 --> 15:40.233
Yeah.

15:40.619 --> 15:42.066
That's him.

15:42.374 --> 15:44.269
Even looks like a cheater.

15:44.709 --> 15:46.690
Word of advice... liars lie.

15:47.450 --> 15:49.988
Don't forgive her. Divorce her.

17:02.330 --> 17:04.295
- Check it out?
- Yeah.

17:06.258 --> 17:07.561
Eric.

17:08.038 --> 17:09.334
Eric!

17:10.704 --> 17:14.071
Don't worry. I didn't tell
that detective anything.

17:19.935 --> 17:22.626
Mind your own business.
He did not kill his wife.

17:31.024 --> 17:33.768
Involuntary manslaughter.
Five with parole in three.

17:33.788 --> 17:35.964
No way. Your client's
a habitual offender.

17:35.984 --> 17:38.418
This time he stabbed a man
to death with a screwdriver.

17:38.438 --> 17:40.438
7 to 15, and that's generous.

17:40.541 --> 17:41.806
Check the pocket.

17:41.909 --> 17:43.508
In limine.

17:43.577 --> 17:46.209
- Screwdriver's out.
- Cops had a warrant, Mandy.

17:46.229 --> 17:47.839
For the house, not the garage,

17:47.859 --> 17:49.479
and certainly not the
car they found it in.

17:49.549 --> 17:50.948
- I've got witnesses.
- Short-rib taco up!

17:50.968 --> 17:52.249
Huh.

17:52.317 --> 17:54.153
I've got witnesses, too.

17:54.173 --> 17:55.673
I'm giving you a freebie.

17:55.742 --> 17:57.108
Take the win.

18:00.428 --> 18:02.213
Never knew you could be so ruthless.

18:02.281 --> 18:04.814
I'm just keeping them honest.

18:04.850 --> 18:07.150
So, what did you need to see me about?

18:07.219 --> 18:09.273
A woman I dated, Tina Sawyer,

18:09.396 --> 18:11.321
showed up at my loft last night.

18:11.857 --> 18:16.051
- And I might have seen her at work.
- Is this the woman Cornell interviewed?

18:16.071 --> 18:19.362
- Dad tell you?
- After the cops did.

18:19.464 --> 18:22.532
I work with these people, Eric.
They tell me things.

18:22.552 --> 18:25.028
So, who is she?

18:26.213 --> 18:27.978
We saw each other
for a couple of months.

18:27.998 --> 18:29.608
Then things got weird.

18:29.628 --> 18:31.540
And you didn't see the red flags?

18:31.609 --> 18:33.376
She always had an explanation.

18:33.478 --> 18:35.757
Yeah, the Cray-crays always do.

18:36.928 --> 18:40.515
I broke up with her, but she just
wouldn't take no for an answer.

18:40.550 --> 18:43.418
She kept calling, e-mailing, texting.

18:43.487 --> 18:45.945
Then she started showing up
everywhere I went.

18:45.965 --> 18:46.985
Mm.

18:47.005 --> 18:49.441
One night I came home, and she, uh...

18:49.461 --> 18:51.660
She was inside my apartment.

18:51.762 --> 18:53.633
Boiling a rabbit?

18:54.832 --> 18:57.765
Covered in bruises...
Threatening to go to the cops

18:57.833 --> 19:01.083
to say that I beat her
if we didn't get back together.

19:01.103 --> 19:03.621
Well, Cornell must have lapped it up.

19:03.641 --> 19:07.009
It corroborates her theory that
you're a woman-beating killer.

19:08.236 --> 19:10.610
- So, what do I do?
- Nothing.

19:10.679 --> 19:12.779
You let Cornell come to you.

19:12.814 --> 19:16.814
And in the meantime, I will go to
court and file a restraining order.

19:21.323 --> 19:22.388
Hey.

19:22.457 --> 19:26.125
Copies for everybody.
Everybody should have that.

19:26.835 --> 19:27.841
This...

19:30.096 --> 19:32.072
What's going on in here?

19:32.495 --> 19:35.618
I'm just bringing Neil
up to speed on the meeting.

19:35.638 --> 19:36.661
My meeting?

19:36.681 --> 19:38.537
Oh. Look, I'm happy to
play second fiddle, Eric.

19:38.639 --> 19:41.111
Won't say a word unless you ask me to.

19:41.428 --> 19:43.942
Yeah. I've been asking.

19:44.044 --> 19:46.496
Still waiting on that answer, though.

19:48.525 --> 19:51.192
Look, you know I'm on your side.

19:51.212 --> 19:53.651
I'd do anything for this firm,
for this family.

19:53.720 --> 19:56.366
- Is there a problem?
- No.

19:58.012 --> 19:59.475
Do you have a minute?

20:09.703 --> 20:11.082
You're prepping Neil for my meeting.

20:11.102 --> 20:13.370
You don't think I can do my job anymore?

20:13.438 --> 20:14.704
I thought you were resigning.

20:14.806 --> 20:17.173
I was distancing myself
to protect the firm.

20:17.275 --> 20:18.774
I don't want what's happening to me

20:18.876 --> 20:20.141
to destroy what you've built.

20:20.244 --> 20:22.210
What we built.

20:22.312 --> 20:25.180
We weather the storm. We don't quit.

20:25.215 --> 20:26.882
The company was for all of you,

20:26.950 --> 20:29.385
but it's become clear Patrick's
in no place to run anything.

20:29.453 --> 20:31.587
Amanda's not interested.
So that leaves you.

20:31.689 --> 20:33.856
If you walk, we might
as well just shut the door.

20:33.957 --> 20:35.223
I'm not gonna let that happen,

20:35.259 --> 20:37.936
and I don't need anyone
looking over my shoulder.

20:39.489 --> 20:41.228
It's been less than two weeks.

20:41.297 --> 20:44.131
- I'm not sure you're ready.
- When do you think I'll be ready?

20:44.166 --> 20:48.113
Three weeks? Three months? Three years?
When were you ready after mom?

20:50.172 --> 20:52.072
Some days I'm still not.

20:54.930 --> 20:56.976
I'm just trying to help.

20:58.913 --> 21:01.680
Without Kate, this is all I have left.

21:03.107 --> 21:05.985
When I am here, I know who I am.

21:06.605 --> 21:08.321
I know what to do.

21:10.391 --> 21:13.325
It's my meeting, my investor.

21:13.678 --> 21:16.429
I'm doing it... alone.

21:27.369 --> 21:28.831
Gavin.

21:29.509 --> 21:30.642
Great to see you.

21:30.710 --> 21:33.210
I have about three portfolios
I want to walk through with you,

21:33.230 --> 21:36.648
and we have a reservation at Luna.

21:37.000 --> 21:38.817
You and I have a seven-year history,

21:38.885 --> 21:40.518
so I wanted to give you the respect

21:40.587 --> 21:43.421
of doing this face-to-face.

21:43.456 --> 21:47.293
I can't have my money invested
with someone accused of murder.

21:47.628 --> 21:49.359
I haven't been accused of anything.

21:49.428 --> 21:51.394
- Not officially, but...
- Surely you don't think

21:51.464 --> 21:53.630
I had anything to do with Kate's death.

21:53.699 --> 21:57.004
I don't believe you did,
but that's not the point.

21:58.167 --> 22:01.771
The accusation itself is enough
to taint you and the firm.

22:03.040 --> 22:05.508
I like you, Eric, but my fiduciary duty

22:05.610 --> 22:08.256
takes precedence
over my personal feelings.

22:08.276 --> 22:10.245
I'm sorry.

22:17.839 --> 22:20.705
_

22:22.520 --> 22:25.460
Tina Sawyer told me
her side of the story,

22:25.529 --> 22:26.895
and I'd like to hear yours.

22:26.930 --> 22:29.063
Why do you need us to tell you anything?

22:29.719 --> 22:30.999
I have to follow every lead,

22:31.067 --> 22:34.668
or I get challenged in court
by someone like you.

22:34.770 --> 22:39.364
Mr. Warner, tell me about your
relationship with Ms. Sawyer.

22:39.558 --> 22:40.703
No.

22:43.199 --> 22:45.312
You don't want to give me
your version of events?

22:45.381 --> 22:47.648
There's no point.

22:48.370 --> 22:49.850
Your wife was murdered.

22:49.919 --> 22:53.219
Eventually, you're gonna have
to answer all kinds of questions,

22:53.321 --> 22:55.688
and a Grand Jury can be very invasive.

22:55.790 --> 22:57.924
Stop trying to scare my client.

22:57.993 --> 23:00.797
You don't have enough
to convene a Grand Jury.

23:00.947 --> 23:02.328
I don't care.

23:03.165 --> 23:04.764
I didn't kill my wife.

23:06.354 --> 23:07.797
So it doesn't matter.

23:07.817 --> 23:09.501
I told you about Kate's black eye,

23:09.570 --> 23:11.302
and I came to you about
Liam's disappearance.

23:11.405 --> 23:12.875
Nothing gets through.

23:13.395 --> 23:16.195
Clearly you don't believe
a word that I say.

23:16.582 --> 23:19.913
The only thing left for me to do
is stop talking to you.

23:25.057 --> 23:26.784
Are you now refusing

23:26.886 --> 23:29.319
to cooperate with the investigation?

23:29.422 --> 23:30.719
Yes.

23:32.085 --> 23:34.252
If you want to arrest me...

23:35.461 --> 23:36.794
Come and get me.

23:44.527 --> 23:47.355
I know less about Liam
now than I did a week ago.

23:47.375 --> 23:49.910
All I know is the kid listened
to some god-awful music.

23:49.945 --> 23:51.611
I had ask him to turn
it off all the time.

23:51.680 --> 23:53.546
Yeah, me too. Me too.

23:53.614 --> 23:55.447
Either something bad happened to him,

23:55.516 --> 23:58.483
or Liam is running
because Kate was onto him.

23:58.519 --> 24:01.362
By "something bad,"
you mean the guy with the gun?

24:01.382 --> 24:04.554
That man doesn't know
how to take no for an answer.

24:05.960 --> 24:07.994
You think he killed Kate?

24:09.196 --> 24:10.382
No.

24:11.397 --> 24:13.197
No, I think he's just looking for Carly.

24:13.266 --> 24:15.987
You know... That...
that girl in the photo.

24:16.803 --> 24:19.236
Who did Liam bring to the party?

24:19.567 --> 24:22.040
I don't know. Check the footage.

24:22.108 --> 24:23.608
You know dad is too paranoid

24:23.710 --> 24:25.677
about proprietary information leaking.

24:25.745 --> 24:26.916
There are no cameras in the office.

24:26.936 --> 24:30.380
There are security feeds
at the entrances and exits.

24:32.417 --> 24:34.250
You're a genius.

24:34.352 --> 24:35.619
Mm.

24:35.721 --> 24:38.021
And tall, handsome.

24:39.925 --> 24:41.357
I'm sorry, Mr. Warner.

24:41.426 --> 24:42.626
I can't give you that footage.

24:42.695 --> 24:43.926
Unfortunately, I don't have anything

24:43.995 --> 24:45.227
from 7:00 to 10:00 P.M. that night.

24:45.296 --> 24:46.662
Did the police take it?

24:46.731 --> 24:48.230
No, sir. They were upset, too.

24:48.332 --> 24:50.499
I don't get it. I thought
we had a 24-hour system.

24:50.519 --> 24:52.083
Either the computer rebooted itself,

24:52.103 --> 24:54.361
or someone erased everything.

24:55.873 --> 24:57.039
Okay.

24:57.108 --> 24:58.040
You know what?

24:58.109 --> 25:00.709
The party started at 7:00.
I can still see who's coming and going.

25:00.729 --> 25:02.043
Give me all the footage you do have...

25:02.145 --> 25:04.378
Everything before 7:00 and after 10:00.

25:04.481 --> 25:06.047
Right away.

26:06.282 --> 26:07.773
You're gonna be great.

26:10.209 --> 26:11.142
Okay.

26:11.243 --> 26:12.476
Wait. I wasn't done yet.

26:12.545 --> 26:13.778
You've been obsessing over these cards

26:13.846 --> 26:14.779
for the last three days.

26:14.881 --> 26:16.847
This is a party for you. Enjoy it.

26:16.916 --> 26:18.816
I'll enjoy it when my speech is over.

26:18.918 --> 26:20.417
- Can I tell you something?
- I know.

26:20.519 --> 26:22.186
I've closed multimillion-dollar
deals before.

26:22.254 --> 26:23.754
I shouldn't be nervous
about a little speech.

26:23.856 --> 26:26.990
Yes, there is that.
There's also something else.

26:28.302 --> 26:29.358
You love me?

26:29.460 --> 26:30.526
I do.

26:30.595 --> 26:32.395
But so does everybody in there,

26:32.497 --> 26:33.830
and no one cares what you're gonna say.

26:33.865 --> 26:35.923
They're all just really happy for you.

26:35.943 --> 26:37.767
You're ready for this.

27:43.831 --> 27:45.564
I don't have good news, Mr. Warner.

27:45.633 --> 27:47.532
All the accounts you asked about

27:47.568 --> 27:50.035
have recently opened
unlimited credit cards.

27:50.071 --> 27:52.503
I think it's fair to say
your company's secure data

27:52.572 --> 27:54.072
has been breached.

27:54.141 --> 27:55.339
Thank you, Mr. Markum.

27:55.408 --> 27:57.108
I appreciate you
getting back to me so quickly.

27:57.210 --> 27:58.442
Certainly.

27:58.511 --> 28:00.378
I'll go ahead and close
those accounts immediately.

28:00.480 --> 28:03.148
And, of course, S.E.G.
will cover all cost incurred.

28:03.250 --> 28:05.016
I'll get the figures to you
shortly, Mr. Warner.

28:05.085 --> 28:06.717
Thank you.

28:18.197 --> 28:19.629
Where's my dad?

28:19.731 --> 28:21.538
It's Monday, Eric.

28:21.723 --> 28:23.466
You know where he is.

28:23.486 --> 28:26.035
Willowbrook. Oh, yes, Doctor.

28:49.759 --> 28:52.794
Sorry, sir. Your children called 911.

28:52.830 --> 28:55.831
Seems your wife was intoxicated
and fell down the stairs.

28:55.933 --> 28:59.766
Orderly to E.R. Orderly to E.R.

29:07.959 --> 29:10.244
Eric, this is unexpected.

29:10.279 --> 29:14.529
I'm glad for the company, but I know
you didn't come to visit your mother.

29:21.022 --> 29:22.755
Kate was onto Liam.

29:22.824 --> 29:25.458
She started an investigation
into his activities

29:25.478 --> 29:28.769
- not long before she died.
- How bad is it?

29:29.397 --> 29:32.365
He stole the identities
of four of our investors

29:32.433 --> 29:34.499
and opened up unlimited lines of credit.

29:35.903 --> 29:38.270
If we can't protect our
investors, we'll lose them.

29:38.372 --> 29:40.672
- I'm so sorry.
- I know.

29:40.774 --> 29:44.042
And whether you believe it or not,
I didn't want to be right.

29:44.144 --> 29:45.838
Have you spoken to the Fraud Department?

29:45.858 --> 29:48.046
Yeah, I've shut down the accounts.

29:48.148 --> 29:50.748
But I wanted to tell you first
before I went to the police.

29:50.816 --> 29:51.849
No.

29:51.951 --> 29:53.184
"No," what?

29:54.921 --> 29:57.765
We're not gonna tell
the police anything.

29:59.332 --> 30:02.093
Kate caught Liam with his
hand in the till, and...

30:02.195 --> 30:03.928
And you shut that down.

30:03.997 --> 30:06.130
- We can cover the costs.
- This isn't about the money.

30:06.232 --> 30:09.545
Did it ever occur to you that Liam
may have killed Kate to cover it up?

30:09.565 --> 30:11.667
Yes. And if so, he should answer for it.

30:11.736 --> 30:14.404
But we can't let one senseless
tragedy create another.

30:14.439 --> 30:17.140
Whatever damage it does to the
firm, our family can handle it.

30:17.209 --> 30:19.075
Eric, this is not just about our family.

30:19.177 --> 30:22.379
Think of our employees,
our investors, their families.

30:22.885 --> 30:25.898
What we do now
affects hundreds of lives.

30:28.152 --> 30:31.020
So, what, you want...
You want me to bury this?

30:31.122 --> 30:34.756
- I'm still the prime suspect, Dad.
- But you didn't do it.

30:34.858 --> 30:37.326
Cornell is a good cop.
She will figure it out.

30:37.395 --> 30:39.728
If Liam killed Kate, she will
find him, she will arrest him,

30:39.797 --> 30:41.662
but the rest of this stays between us.

30:42.719 --> 30:44.665
Look, you have to trust me.

30:45.497 --> 30:48.502
And if you can't do that...

30:48.604 --> 30:50.209
Obey me.

31:20.104 --> 31:22.888
That's new.

31:22.908 --> 31:26.406
Hey, which one of us
is currently day-drinking?

31:33.783 --> 31:36.683
How'd you find me anyway?

31:36.703 --> 31:39.162
I got friends, just like dad.

31:39.182 --> 31:41.548
- Only less reputable.
- Ah.

31:42.517 --> 31:44.918
Want to tell me what you're doing here?

31:48.464 --> 31:49.979
Our father...

31:50.693 --> 31:52.125
Is an ass.

31:56.216 --> 31:57.296
Yeah.

31:57.316 --> 32:00.265
Yeah, he is, but not usually to you.

32:00.367 --> 32:01.905
Yeah.

32:02.672 --> 32:04.036
Oh.

32:05.544 --> 32:07.147
It's Monday.

32:08.760 --> 32:11.112
And you were talking to Dad,
which means...

32:13.540 --> 32:15.147
Did you see mom?

32:16.766 --> 32:19.683
But she didn't see me.

32:19.786 --> 32:21.452
That's not funny.

32:25.757 --> 32:28.092
When was the last time
that you were there?

32:30.830 --> 32:32.378
I don't know.

32:33.223 --> 32:35.598
Why don't you ever go and see her?

32:39.772 --> 32:41.271
Do you?

32:43.242 --> 32:44.841
Sometimes.

32:48.464 --> 32:50.980
I was 7 when it happened, Eric.

32:54.149 --> 32:56.085
You and Mandy had a mom.

32:56.105 --> 32:57.987
I didn't.

32:58.007 --> 33:00.907
- And I try to remember how it was.
- Hey, hey.

33:01.523 --> 33:04.026
You shouldn't, Patrick.

33:04.435 --> 33:05.694
Okay?

33:05.797 --> 33:10.564
Maybe Dad can't face it, but the
truth is, she isn't here anymore.

33:11.142 --> 33:13.168
All right?

33:18.608 --> 33:20.128
Come on.

33:21.344 --> 33:22.343
Ahh.

33:22.363 --> 33:24.178
Come on. I'll take you home.

33:30.219 --> 33:32.052
One for each drink.

33:32.121 --> 33:34.321
It'll soak up that booze.

33:34.423 --> 33:37.090
That's why you always smell like syrup.

33:38.427 --> 33:40.527
I know my way around a kitchen.

33:40.629 --> 33:42.728
I grew up watching you.

33:42.831 --> 33:44.663
We needed to eat.

33:44.683 --> 33:47.266
I still do. If I relied on
Melanie to cook a meal,

33:47.286 --> 33:49.902
I'd have starved to death years ago.

33:51.172 --> 33:52.905
Thanks for coming to pick me up.

33:53.564 --> 33:55.407
You'd do the same for me.

33:55.476 --> 33:57.643
Actually, you have done the same for me

33:57.663 --> 33:59.311
many, many, many times, so...

34:11.958 --> 34:14.692
- Damn it.
- Who is it?

34:17.179 --> 34:18.757
Shane Campbell.

34:21.199 --> 34:23.367
I saw you outside my store
the other night,

34:23.435 --> 34:26.203
- so I figured the police told you...
- I know about the motel.

34:26.239 --> 34:27.804
Motel? What motel?

34:27.873 --> 34:29.909
- I just want to say...
- Hey, shut up, Shane.

34:29.929 --> 34:32.342
Nothing happened. Okay?

34:32.409 --> 34:34.155
So, what the hell were
you doing with my wife

34:34.175 --> 34:35.411
at a motel, Shane?

34:35.513 --> 34:37.246
I work in security.

34:37.266 --> 34:40.589
She asked me to meet her there to help
install tracking software on her iPad.

34:40.609 --> 34:42.078
Tracking software?

34:42.098 --> 34:44.899
At first, I thought it was
to track her cheating husband.

34:44.934 --> 34:46.701
That's a large part of my business.

34:48.437 --> 34:51.304
I, uh... I made a pass.

34:51.929 --> 34:53.621
It was a big mistake.

34:54.255 --> 34:55.475
Kate wasn't interested.

34:56.563 --> 34:58.874
So, what did she want you to track?

34:58.894 --> 35:01.273
I don't know. She wouldn't say.

35:01.758 --> 35:04.921
Anyway, I just wanted you
to know the truth.

35:07.510 --> 35:10.129
She chose that motel specifically?

35:10.149 --> 35:12.349
Yeah, I sure wouldn't have.

35:13.920 --> 35:16.521
I am so sorry.

35:17.323 --> 35:19.323
She was one of a kind.

35:19.425 --> 35:21.113
Yeah.

35:21.368 --> 35:23.159
She was.

35:30.153 --> 35:32.012
I think I know what she was doing.

35:32.032 --> 35:34.866
It's an extortion letter.

35:36.436 --> 35:38.565
She was tracking the money.

35:38.988 --> 35:41.579
What money? What are you talking about?

35:45.241 --> 35:47.244
- Blackmail.
- What?

35:47.312 --> 35:50.848
This is the location of the
motel where Kate met Shane.

35:50.950 --> 35:54.317
This is the location of the money drop.

35:54.419 --> 35:58.221
- They're right across the street.
- Wait. Who is blackmailing you?

35:58.322 --> 36:00.089
I have no idea.

36:00.741 --> 36:02.591
No one tells me anything in this family.

36:02.952 --> 36:05.602
Does Amanda know?

36:07.825 --> 36:09.265
Okay, that is creepy.

36:09.367 --> 36:10.790
How did she do that?

36:10.810 --> 36:13.002
Nah, nah.

36:13.071 --> 36:15.436
Uh, do you have cameras in the house?

36:15.505 --> 36:19.808
Because we were just talking
about you and it was not nice.

36:20.326 --> 36:21.789
Oh, um...

36:21.974 --> 36:24.578
Does he have to go right now? He...

36:25.082 --> 36:26.981
Okay, Mandy. I will let him know.

36:27.139 --> 36:28.316
What is it?

36:28.418 --> 36:31.018
Uh, Cornell wants you to come in.

36:31.120 --> 36:33.854
Something about Tina Sawyer,
and who is Tina Sawyer?

36:36.659 --> 36:38.225
I'm not going back there.

36:38.294 --> 36:39.994
Eric, I hear you, and I get it,

36:40.096 --> 36:41.762
but she's not gonna drop it.

36:41.864 --> 36:44.053
Would you rather she come to you?

36:45.728 --> 36:47.860
Fine. I'll see you in a half-hour.

36:53.219 --> 36:54.654
What do you want?

36:54.674 --> 36:57.446
I understand you took out a T.R.O.

36:57.754 --> 36:59.234
So?

37:00.000 --> 37:03.260
I found out more
about Ms. Sawyer's story,

37:03.280 --> 37:04.846
and it turns out you're not the only man

37:04.881 --> 37:07.249
that she's accused of domestic violence.

37:07.351 --> 37:09.217
So I added a recommendation

37:09.285 --> 37:13.552
that the judge lengthen your
restraining order against her.

37:16.189 --> 37:18.559
What's in it for you?

37:18.579 --> 37:21.228
My job is to protect
and serve, Mr. Warner.

37:22.004 --> 37:23.810
- Is that everything?
- No.

37:23.830 --> 37:26.432
It seems Kate was using
digital-tracking software.

37:26.501 --> 37:28.501
Did she have any electronic devices

37:28.603 --> 37:31.804
other than her business
computer or personal laptop?

37:32.219 --> 37:34.240
You have her cellphone.

37:35.316 --> 37:36.629
Yes, I do.

37:38.052 --> 37:40.149
So no other devices?

37:40.431 --> 37:41.744
No.

37:43.665 --> 37:44.849
Hmm.

37:45.789 --> 37:46.833
We done?

37:57.795 --> 38:01.182
I can't believe Cornell
backed the restraining order.

38:01.202 --> 38:02.202
Okay.

38:03.017 --> 38:05.035
Not okay. Good.

38:05.104 --> 38:07.070
She's been building a case against you,

38:07.139 --> 38:09.407
and part of it centered around
your history of violence.

38:09.475 --> 38:11.318
First, you hit Steven Porter.

38:11.338 --> 38:13.277
Then she thinks I beat Kate...

38:13.524 --> 38:14.905
- And Tina.
- And Tina lied.

38:14.925 --> 38:17.658
So Cornell's theory that you're
a wife-beater gets blown up.

38:17.727 --> 38:20.427
She would never go in front
of a judge in your defense

38:20.496 --> 38:22.663
if she really thought you killed Kate.

38:25.042 --> 38:26.600
I don't know what to say.

38:26.636 --> 38:28.702
What have I been telling you?

38:28.771 --> 38:30.237
- Don't say anything.
- Mm.

38:30.272 --> 38:32.439
Yes, counselor.

38:36.144 --> 38:39.178
I don't know which poor
bastard Cornell is onto next,

38:39.247 --> 38:41.581
but she is no longer focused on you.

38:47.488 --> 38:49.656
Hey.

38:49.676 --> 38:52.123
You got any connections
that can run a plate?

38:52.717 --> 38:54.297
Where did you get this?

38:54.317 --> 38:57.154
- The security footage at S.E.G.
- Why do you need a plate run?

38:57.174 --> 38:59.865
Because I want to know
who owns this vehicle.

39:00.339 --> 39:03.001
Less than 15 minutes ago,
you were the prime suspect

39:03.021 --> 39:04.536
of a murder investigation.

39:04.605 --> 39:08.173
Any misstep, and you will be
back in Cornell's sights.

39:09.106 --> 39:10.106
Okay.

39:10.646 --> 39:14.478
- Okay.
- I wouldn't even jaywalk if I were you.

39:14.826 --> 39:16.480
Got it.

39:16.583 --> 39:17.776
So...

39:18.470 --> 39:21.131
You gonna help me run that plate or not?

39:22.188 --> 39:25.022
Ricky, uh, I need an address.

39:25.124 --> 39:26.656
Can you run this plate for me?

39:26.758 --> 39:29.059
- Sure thing.
- It's got to be done right now.

39:29.127 --> 39:30.627
Yeah. No big deal.

39:31.623 --> 39:34.117
Can you, uh, do it off the books?

40:20.272 --> 40:21.675
Open up.

40:26.517 --> 40:29.016
I know you're home. Open the door.

40:38.307 --> 40:39.491
Sorry. I...

40:39.593 --> 40:41.226
I was sleeping.

40:42.677 --> 40:44.130
Where's Liam?

40:45.214 --> 40:46.347
Who?

40:46.367 --> 40:49.468
Liam Connors...
Brown hair, about this tall.

40:50.218 --> 40:52.013
Sorry. I don't know any Liam.

40:52.033 --> 40:53.638
Sure, you do.

40:54.144 --> 40:57.992
You picked him up from a party in that
very car that's in your driveway.

40:58.838 --> 41:00.111
I, um...

41:04.728 --> 41:06.201
Yeah, she knows where Liam is,

41:06.221 --> 41:09.286
but she's not talking... yet.

41:13.378 --> 41:15.926
So, you staying or you going?
