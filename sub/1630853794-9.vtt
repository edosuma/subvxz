WEBVTT

00:18.852 --> 00:21.771
[grunts] Bruce
isn't thinking straight.

00:21.855 --> 00:24.315
Okay? He's outside doing
something awful with Frank.

00:24.399 --> 00:26.651
Bruce sees 10 steps ahead
of everything he does.

00:26.735 --> 00:29.070
Whatever he's doing,
he knows it'll be safe.

00:29.154 --> 00:31.656
You know how depressed Selina
breaking it off has made him.

00:31.740 --> 00:33.283
Oh, please.
He broke up with her.

00:33.366 --> 00:36.870
Jesus! He's never gonna
say that he loves you, dude.

00:36.953 --> 00:38.371
I'm slightly worried that

00:38.455 --> 00:40.623
my extremely
realistic portrayal

00:40.707 --> 00:41.958
of his murdered father

00:42.041 --> 00:43.918
may have played
a small part in this.

00:44.002 --> 00:47.213
Oh, wow. Is your next role
Sherlock Fucking Holmes?

00:47.297 --> 00:49.257
Look, he's been
down in the dumps,

00:49.340 --> 00:51.301
but Bruce would
never do anything

00:51.384 --> 00:52.886
to put others in danger.

00:52.969 --> 00:57.015
Well... [chuckles] I can't
believe I'm about to say this.

00:57.098 --> 00:58.850
I'd love for you all to meet...

00:59.768 --> 01:00.643
my parents.

01:07.776 --> 01:09.194
[all gasping]

01:09.277 --> 01:11.362
[theme music playing]

01:13.406 --> 01:14.324
I see how this looks.

01:14.407 --> 01:15.617
But it's just temporary.

01:15.700 --> 01:17.994
A few more experiments
and I'm positive

01:18.077 --> 01:19.412
I'll turn my zombie parents

01:19.496 --> 01:22.040
back into my beloved,
very much alive parents.

01:22.123 --> 01:23.666
Oh, I've got to get
him on the pod.

01:23.750 --> 01:25.084
Let's get you down to the lab

01:25.168 --> 01:27.003
to see if we can extract
that plant growth hormone

01:27.086 --> 01:30.799
so you don't become another one
of Alfred's topiaries. [laughs]

01:30.882 --> 01:32.675
-You did this.
-Bullshit.

01:32.759 --> 01:34.427
Frank was only
supposed to resurrect

01:34.511 --> 01:36.471
dead plants, not humans.

01:36.554 --> 01:39.015
Billionaire bitch boy
obviously altered Frank

01:39.098 --> 01:40.683
to bring back his dead parents

01:40.767 --> 01:43.603
instead of just, you know,
dealing with his emotions.

01:43.686 --> 01:47.232
Whoa! And I thought
I was the psychiatrist
in this relationship.

01:47.315 --> 01:49.234
If you untie us,
I won't kill Bruce

01:49.317 --> 01:51.903
in front of his dead parents
for what he did. Deal?

01:51.986 --> 01:54.781
What she meant is we need
to figure out how far reaching

01:54.864 --> 01:56.157
what Bruce did goes.

01:56.241 --> 01:57.826
Free us so we can
figure out how to stop it.

01:57.909 --> 01:59.911
We're not letting you go.
We can deal with it ourselves.

02:00.662 --> 02:01.579
Oh, nards!

02:01.663 --> 02:03.289
[grunting]

02:05.124 --> 02:06.709
Ah, my wrists can breathe.

02:06.793 --> 02:08.211
What the hell are you doing?

02:08.294 --> 02:10.421
I know it's hard to hear,
but I think Bruce messed up.

02:10.505 --> 02:11.756
No, that, that can't be.

02:11.840 --> 02:14.092
There's a freaking
zombie horde outside.

02:14.175 --> 02:15.802
Well, how many are there?

02:15.885 --> 02:20.056
Hmm. I'd say
five, 10, maybe 20
football fields' worth.

02:20.139 --> 02:22.100
Oh, my God. Frank is out there.

02:23.852 --> 02:25.228
Hey, man. Dude to dude,

02:25.311 --> 02:27.146
I'm not in this crew.
They basically tricked me.

02:27.230 --> 02:28.731
So leave me out
of whatever justice

02:28.815 --> 02:30.275
you're bringing them.
All right?

02:30.358 --> 02:32.026
[zombies banging and growling]

02:34.237 --> 02:35.238
Oh, my God.

02:35.321 --> 02:37.073
They turned Frank
into a zombie.

02:37.156 --> 02:41.244
No. No, I was just pretending
to be one to get here safe.

02:41.327 --> 02:43.371
-[grunts]
-Never seen
a fucking zombie movie?

02:43.454 --> 02:44.873
Yeah, she's still
making her way through

02:44.956 --> 02:46.708
the fourth season
of that pottery competition.

02:46.791 --> 02:48.835
-You like it too.
-Yeah. Okay. True.

02:50.003 --> 02:51.504
[grunts]

02:51.588 --> 02:54.424
We might want to do something
about Frank's friends here.

02:59.679 --> 03:00.972
Frank, what happened?

03:01.055 --> 03:03.141
That walking definition
of white privilege

03:03.224 --> 03:05.602
planted me directly
into the root system

03:05.685 --> 03:07.103
surrounding this house.

03:07.186 --> 03:09.355
Roots reach out like sperms.

03:09.439 --> 03:10.940
My shit went everywhere

03:11.024 --> 03:13.443
bringing back all kinds
of dead assholes.

03:13.526 --> 03:15.028
Well, how can we stop them?

03:15.111 --> 03:17.447
All I know is stay
the fuck away
from their puke.

03:17.530 --> 03:20.408
Oh, shit. Okay,
hypothetically speaking,

03:20.491 --> 03:21.784
if, say, a friend happened

03:21.868 --> 03:23.786
to come in contact
with said vomit,

03:23.870 --> 03:25.496
what side effects
are we looking at here?

03:25.580 --> 03:26.748
Psycho, are you
trying to tell us

03:26.831 --> 03:27.916
that someone vomited on you?

03:27.999 --> 03:29.292
What? No. [chuckles nervously]

03:29.375 --> 03:33.129
Like I said, hypothetical
about a... Oh, fuck!

03:33.212 --> 03:36.049
Oh, bit on the nose,
even for me.

03:36.132 --> 03:38.468
Okay. I might have gotten
a little vomit on...

03:38.551 --> 03:41.012
Fuck me in the
nasal urethra!

03:42.847 --> 03:44.599
Okay. We gotta figure out
how to reverse this

03:44.682 --> 03:46.726
before people
we actually care about

03:46.809 --> 03:48.311
are turned into that.

03:48.394 --> 03:50.146
[video game beeping]

03:50.229 --> 03:53.232
So this is where
I do my actual job.

03:53.316 --> 03:55.068
I'm basically
the last line of defense

03:55.151 --> 03:56.986
Gotham has against total chaos.

03:57.070 --> 03:57.987
I got my own spotlight.

03:58.071 --> 04:00.281
I mean, whatever.

04:00.365 --> 04:04.035
Mother, Father,
this is your grandson.

04:04.118 --> 04:07.080
Damian, say hello to your soon
to be completely alive

04:07.163 --> 04:08.665
grandmama and grandpapa.

04:09.749 --> 04:10.792
[retching]

04:14.253 --> 04:15.630
[video game beeping]

04:18.424 --> 04:20.218
Teens, right?

04:20.301 --> 04:21.678
Oh, right.
You died when I was eight.

04:21.761 --> 04:22.845
Well, they're a handful.

04:25.431 --> 04:28.518
Uh, do I want to know
what's going on down there?

04:28.601 --> 04:30.478
Nope? Okay, great.

04:30.561 --> 04:31.521
That's great.

04:33.606 --> 04:36.818
[Clayface] The zombies are
headed for Gotham Central Park.

04:36.901 --> 04:38.403
Jazzapajizza!

04:40.029 --> 04:42.365
What? Jazz Fest got canceled
three years ago,

04:42.448 --> 04:44.200
so they rebranded it
to a three day event.

04:44.283 --> 04:45.827
And you know what? I love jazz.

04:45.910 --> 04:47.078
Okay? Get over it.

04:47.161 --> 04:48.538
Wait, Frank.

04:48.621 --> 04:51.124
Are you saying that
every dead person in Gotham

04:51.207 --> 04:52.750
may have been
brought back to life?

04:52.834 --> 04:54.377
-It's possible.
-Ah-ha!

04:54.460 --> 04:56.462
Well, if you'll excuse me,
I have some errands to run.

04:56.546 --> 04:59.716
I mean, it's clear the zombies
share DNA with the plants,

04:59.799 --> 05:01.342
so there's reason to believe

05:01.426 --> 05:02.969
that they're connected
to the green.

05:03.052 --> 05:04.345
Maybe if I just go in there,

05:04.429 --> 05:06.222
I can find a way
to control them.

05:06.305 --> 05:07.557
No. No, no way.

05:07.640 --> 05:09.100
The last time you went there,
you almost died.

05:09.183 --> 05:10.893
What other choice do we have?

05:10.977 --> 05:12.979
[sighs] I hate saying this,
but the Bludhaven
boner's right.

05:13.062 --> 05:14.981
Plus, I know what
to expect now.

05:15.064 --> 05:16.566
I've got this, peanut.

05:16.649 --> 05:18.651
Who knew confidence
was my kink?

05:18.735 --> 05:21.863
Okay, while I'm in there,
you and the bat freaks
try to stall them off.

05:21.946 --> 05:25.158
And you're delegating.
Oh. I'm gonna need
to change my shorts.

05:25.241 --> 05:28.202
[smooches] Oh. God, I love you.

05:28.286 --> 05:29.912
I know. Now, go!

05:34.042 --> 05:35.835
[inhales and exhales]

05:39.714 --> 05:41.466
All right. Which way
to the Batcave?

05:41.549 --> 05:43.926
What? What's this
Batcave you speak of?

05:44.010 --> 05:47.263
Yeah, it sounds, um, scary.

05:47.346 --> 05:49.348
Not someplace I'd like to go.

05:49.432 --> 05:51.768
Guys, I know Bruce is Batman.

05:51.851 --> 05:54.270
Bruce Vilanch is Batman?

05:54.353 --> 05:56.564
Oh. Wow.
Jokes and crime fighting.

05:56.647 --> 05:57.940
What a guy!

05:58.024 --> 06:00.193
Oh. For fuck's sake.
I was just in his head.

06:00.276 --> 06:01.444
He literally told me.

06:01.527 --> 06:03.112
So you can either
keep this shit up

06:03.196 --> 06:04.906
or we can go and save Gotham.

06:05.948 --> 06:07.533
[sighs] Fine, this way.

06:09.118 --> 06:10.286
[exclaims mockingly]

06:16.167 --> 06:17.710
Remember, Harley,
you're in the Batwing,

06:17.794 --> 06:19.087
which means
you're representing--

06:19.170 --> 06:20.338
[Harley screaming]

06:20.421 --> 06:21.422
[laughing]

06:21.506 --> 06:23.216
This is awesome.

06:23.299 --> 06:25.885
Now let's go stop
these undead dickheads.

06:27.261 --> 06:28.262
We got this, Ive.

06:45.780 --> 06:49.992
All right. You got this.

06:50.076 --> 06:52.870
You know, I'm psyched
for Jazzapajizza too.

06:52.954 --> 06:54.372
[laughs] If these zombies

06:54.455 --> 06:55.873
stop me from seeing
a jazz legend

06:55.957 --> 06:59.752
go off on his flugelhorn,
I'll lose my shit.

07:02.797 --> 07:04.507
You better hurry
your ass up, Ivy.

07:05.758 --> 07:07.635
Whoo!

07:15.893 --> 07:17.562
Pamela, wait.

07:17.645 --> 07:19.105
Alec, I'm kind of
in the middle of something.

07:19.188 --> 07:21.732
So if you need to talk,
maybe Nora is available.

07:21.816 --> 07:23.734
I'm here for you.

07:23.818 --> 07:26.571
You know what?
I appreciate the support
on that. Thank you.

07:26.654 --> 07:29.198
I can feel
your conflict inside.

07:29.282 --> 07:31.033
I'm sorry. What are
you talking about?

07:31.117 --> 07:35.454
The conflict of who
the real you is.
Good versus evil.

07:35.538 --> 07:36.706
Which are you?

07:36.789 --> 07:38.708
The green can give you
immense power.

07:38.791 --> 07:40.710
Power that would make it
easy for you to help

07:40.793 --> 07:41.878
or hurt this world,

07:41.961 --> 07:43.921
to complete any plan
you can imagine.

07:44.005 --> 07:46.424
I implore you
to use it for good.

07:46.507 --> 07:48.885
Even a plan that was ruined
by a selfish billionaire?

07:48.968 --> 07:51.387
Um, yeah.

07:54.765 --> 07:56.726
Oh, boy,
I biffed that speech.

08:09.739 --> 08:13.117
I think now would be
a great time to figure
your shit out.

08:21.000 --> 08:24.295
We are seeing that
flugelhorn phenom!

08:25.046 --> 08:26.297
[all groaning]

08:29.008 --> 08:30.176
[screaming]

08:33.888 --> 08:35.765
Okay. That's not
that many zombies.

08:35.848 --> 08:38.142
[chuckles nervously] Oh, shit.

08:38.226 --> 08:39.477
[cell phone ringing]

08:39.560 --> 08:41.145
Hey, Harley, wait a second.

08:41.229 --> 08:42.396
Are you in the Batwing?

08:42.480 --> 08:44.065
Yeah. Long story.

08:44.148 --> 08:45.483
Are you in the middle of some
ceremonial crap or something?

08:45.566 --> 08:47.818
Yeah. Long story. What's up?

08:47.902 --> 08:49.278
Gotham's swarming with zombies.

08:49.362 --> 08:50.613
Ivy's in Wayne Manor,
stuck in the green,

08:50.696 --> 08:51.822
I need you
to make sure she's okay.

08:51.906 --> 08:53.533
Oh, you can count on me.

08:55.618 --> 08:56.869
[toilet flushes]

08:56.953 --> 08:59.330
All right, let's see
what this bad boy can do.

09:00.748 --> 09:02.291
Hey, where the hell
are the missiles

09:02.375 --> 09:03.543
or machine guns on this?

09:03.626 --> 09:05.378
-There are none.
-And why is that?

09:05.461 --> 09:08.422
We decided, as a family,
we don't believe in killing.

09:08.506 --> 09:10.091
What, anyone?

09:10.174 --> 09:12.176
What if it's Gwyneth Paltrow
and she's, like, eating a baby?

09:12.260 --> 09:14.303
You know, or like
a massive asshole.

09:14.387 --> 09:17.348
Not even massive... butt holes.

09:17.431 --> 09:19.767
[sighs in exasperation]
Saying butt hole's
so much worse.

09:19.850 --> 09:22.812
It paints a gross picture.
[sighs in disgust]

09:26.899 --> 09:29.652
Whoa! Ivy, you dramatic
motherfucker!

09:29.735 --> 09:31.404
What the hell
happened in there?

09:31.487 --> 09:35.825
I found this energy,
this power and I entered it.

09:35.908 --> 09:39.996
I became a part of it
and it became a part of me,

09:40.079 --> 09:43.791
and it felt amazing,

09:43.874 --> 09:46.252
like getting a massage
on mushrooms,

09:46.335 --> 09:50.464
and also I realized I can
pull off a kitten heel.

09:50.548 --> 09:53.134
Okay. Okay, but what's
with all the zombies?

09:53.217 --> 09:55.303
I can control them.

09:55.386 --> 09:58.014
Make them do Beyonce's
sick dance from homecoming.

09:58.097 --> 10:01.017
I want to see these fools
pantomime all the horns.

10:01.100 --> 10:03.269
I think that's maybe
like too much to ask.

10:03.352 --> 10:05.438
But how about this?

10:05.521 --> 10:06.981
[humming]

10:08.024 --> 10:10.109
God damn, you need to get out.

10:10.192 --> 10:12.028
All right. Let's stop the rest.

10:12.111 --> 10:15.906
No. This is still my plan.

10:15.990 --> 10:17.366
It's not exactly
how I saw it going,

10:17.450 --> 10:20.536
but they're out creating
Eden with their vomit.

10:20.620 --> 10:24.832
I can remake the city
exactly as I envisioned it.

10:24.915 --> 10:26.459
That's not what
you told Harley.

10:26.542 --> 10:28.169
Maybe check with her first.

10:28.252 --> 10:31.756
Oh, she's gonna understand.
She wants this as much as I do.

10:31.839 --> 10:33.883
Now, let's go

10:33.966 --> 10:37.595
-terraform this motherfucker.
-[laughing]

10:42.975 --> 10:46.270
No. Stop it, zombies.
Stop tickling. [laughing]

10:46.354 --> 10:49.023
Get away from me!
Oh, that was too much.

10:50.066 --> 10:52.026
Ivy? Ivy!

10:52.109 --> 10:53.527
I told you guys
to wait downstairs.

10:53.611 --> 10:55.654
I'm just grabbing a snack.

10:55.738 --> 10:56.989
What are you doing in my house?

10:57.073 --> 10:58.240
Wait, watch out.

10:58.324 --> 10:59.617
There are two zombies
right behind you.

10:59.700 --> 11:01.160
Those are my parents.

11:01.243 --> 11:03.662
Well, they're zombies,
but they won't be much longer.

11:05.289 --> 11:07.792
I know how this looks,
but I'm not crazy.

11:07.875 --> 11:10.419
I just want to bring
my zombie parents back to life.

11:10.503 --> 11:12.129
And what are you
doing in my house?

11:12.213 --> 11:13.589
I was in here to help.

11:13.673 --> 11:15.424
Do you know
what's going on out there?

11:15.508 --> 11:17.760
-Jazzapajizza.
-Zombie apocalypse.

11:17.843 --> 11:19.595
Wait. There are more undead
than just my parents?

11:19.678 --> 11:21.972
Oh, yeah.
Look, I'm not judging.

11:22.056 --> 11:23.682
We all handle
grief differently.

11:23.766 --> 11:25.434
I mean, I've been off
this whole year

11:25.518 --> 11:28.687
since my dad died,
and we weren't even that close.

11:28.771 --> 11:30.064
I can't concentrate.

11:30.147 --> 11:31.357
I've barely been journaling

11:31.440 --> 11:33.442
and I killed another one
of my brothers.

11:33.526 --> 11:36.654
Anyway, look, it takes time
to process these things.

11:36.737 --> 11:39.657
Although, didn't your parents
die like a while ago?

11:39.740 --> 11:41.450
Is 30 years a while?

11:41.534 --> 11:43.119
Okay. Now I am judging.

11:43.202 --> 11:45.454
It feels like you should be
much further along than this.

11:45.538 --> 11:47.123
I mean, you're
obsessed about the past

11:47.206 --> 11:49.417
and missing out on the present

11:49.500 --> 11:51.669
and also starting
a zombie apocalypse.

11:51.752 --> 11:53.087
Is it that bad?

11:53.170 --> 11:54.713
Oh, my God,
it's the end of the world.

11:54.797 --> 11:56.966
Gotham's falling.
We're all gonna die.

11:57.049 --> 11:58.968
Give me your pen.
I wanna slit my throat.

11:59.051 --> 12:01.178
-What have I done?
-[cat meowing]

12:01.262 --> 12:03.514
I think your dad
just ate your cat.

12:03.597 --> 12:05.307
And that cat looked expensive.

12:23.242 --> 12:24.994
[Harley] Hey,
look at me out here

12:25.077 --> 12:27.580
with you two
just saving the world
like a big old nerd.

12:27.663 --> 12:29.248
As soon as Ivy has
control of those zombies

12:29.331 --> 12:31.834
we'll have Gotham
cleaner than ever. Whoo!

12:32.501 --> 12:34.545
[grunting]

12:40.634 --> 12:43.179
So how many of these
do we need?

12:43.262 --> 12:44.221
All of them.

13:01.697 --> 13:03.032
What the hell?

13:03.115 --> 13:03.949
[gasps]

13:05.284 --> 13:06.744
[gasping]

13:06.827 --> 13:08.120
Harley, what's going on?

13:08.204 --> 13:10.623
It's like they found a purpose.

13:15.753 --> 13:18.881
[gasps] They're
destroying everything.

13:18.964 --> 13:20.883
Wait, not everything.

13:22.551 --> 13:23.761
Mama Macaroni's?

13:25.554 --> 13:27.431
[gasps] Ivy?

13:28.516 --> 13:30.601
[audience cheering]

13:32.019 --> 13:33.854
[laughs] Thank you.

13:33.938 --> 13:35.898
How are we doing tonight?

13:35.981 --> 13:38.692
All right. Yeah. All right.

13:40.277 --> 13:42.571
Our next act was
booked last year.

13:42.655 --> 13:44.990
But then some crazy clown
went a bit extreme

13:45.074 --> 13:47.618
and got Jazzapajizza cancelled.

13:47.701 --> 13:50.287
My bad. [laughs maliciously]

13:50.371 --> 13:57.670
Anyway, it's my pleasure
to introduce Joey Q and
Centri-Flugel Force.

13:57.753 --> 13:58.837
Jeez, that's tortured.

13:58.921 --> 14:00.881
[audience cheering]

14:04.343 --> 14:06.387
[playing jazz music]

14:17.815 --> 14:20.609
[all screaming]

14:28.409 --> 14:30.452
[music continues]

14:34.623 --> 14:37.835
[laughs] Musicians can get
folks to scream in a way

14:37.918 --> 14:42.590
I always tried to achieve
but I never could.

14:42.673 --> 14:49.722
Hey, nobody touches Joey Q
and the Centri-Flugel Force.

14:49.805 --> 14:53.225
Zombies and plants,
ghouls and greens,

14:53.309 --> 14:55.853
it is my pleasure
to introduce to you

14:55.936 --> 15:01.900
the Vine Vixen,
the Lady of Leaves,
your one and only queen,

15:01.984 --> 15:04.445
Dr. Pamela Ivy.

15:04.528 --> 15:07.823
Hello, Gotham.
Thank you. Thank you.

15:07.906 --> 15:12.036
[chuckles] Yes.
Looking sexy tonight.

15:12.119 --> 15:18.792
Look, for too long,
humans have killed us
for their convenience.

15:18.876 --> 15:21.503
Cutting us down
to build their homes

15:21.587 --> 15:25.591
or so they can feed
their unhealthy lust for meat

15:25.674 --> 15:29.428
or taking a passing interest
in greening up their homes,

15:29.511 --> 15:33.432
only to lose that interest,
letting us die

15:33.515 --> 15:36.018
unloved in a corner.

15:36.101 --> 15:38.854
They spit on us and piss on us.

15:38.937 --> 15:42.524
It's time for us to spit back.

15:43.192 --> 15:44.652
[plays melody]

15:44.735 --> 15:47.821
For today,
we announce to the world

15:47.905 --> 15:52.117
that Gotham City
is going green.

15:57.456 --> 15:59.041
[woman screams]

16:16.392 --> 16:17.434
[screams]

16:17.518 --> 16:18.352
[grunts]

16:20.312 --> 16:21.188
[gasps]

16:23.816 --> 16:25.818
[Harley] Get somewhere
safe, Bats.

16:27.653 --> 16:29.571
Oh. What the hell
are you doing, Ive?

16:40.082 --> 16:41.208
[screams]

16:50.926 --> 16:53.053
What the hell is going on?

16:53.846 --> 16:54.805
It's Ivy.

16:58.350 --> 16:59.601
Oh, shit.

16:59.685 --> 17:02.312
-We have to take her out.
-By any means necessary.

17:02.396 --> 17:04.022
What happened
to no killing things?

17:04.106 --> 17:06.191
Sometimes we're forced
to make exceptions.

17:06.275 --> 17:08.944
[sighs] All right,
let's do this.

17:09.028 --> 17:12.281
Wait, wait.
Please, just let me
talk to Ivy.

17:12.364 --> 17:15.701
Harley, I know you love her,
but I think we're past talking.

17:15.784 --> 17:16.952
She will listen to me.

17:17.035 --> 17:18.746
I know it.
Please give me 10 minutes

17:18.829 --> 17:20.330
and this will
all be figured out.

17:21.707 --> 17:24.334
Fine, but hurry the hell up.

17:32.009 --> 17:34.970
-Hey, hey, she's good.
She's with me.
-[zombie grunts]

17:35.053 --> 17:38.098
Holy shit, Ive,
you look hot as hell!

17:38.182 --> 17:39.808
And I was so wrong
about the kitten heel.

17:39.892 --> 17:42.519
[chuckles] Right? I know.
I was like, "What?"

17:42.603 --> 17:43.854
It took me by surprise, too.

17:47.399 --> 17:49.860
So, um, how you doing?

17:49.943 --> 17:51.445
Honestly. Amazing.

17:51.528 --> 17:55.157
I just have never
felt better about myself

17:55.240 --> 17:58.285
than I do right now.
I mean, Harley, we're doing it.

17:58.368 --> 18:01.455
Uh-huh.
And what exactly is "it"?

18:01.538 --> 18:02.664
Our plan.

18:02.748 --> 18:05.584
Look. We're turning
Gotham into Eden.

18:05.667 --> 18:07.836
Mmm. [clears throat]
I don't know if this was,

18:07.920 --> 18:09.838
like, totally what
the plan was.

18:09.922 --> 18:12.674
No, I mean, it's not exactly
what we talked about.

18:12.758 --> 18:13.926
Bruce fucked that up.

18:14.009 --> 18:16.345
But then I realized
I can salvage it,

18:16.428 --> 18:18.680
call an audible
and still basically

18:18.764 --> 18:21.517
get the end result
that we wanted.

18:21.600 --> 18:23.352
Look, the old me
would have given up,

18:23.435 --> 18:28.106
but, Harls, you, you helped me
awaken the real me.

18:28.190 --> 18:29.608
I mean, don't you see?

18:29.691 --> 18:32.820
You, no matter what,
believed in me

18:32.903 --> 18:36.365
and finally showed me
how to believe in myself.

18:36.448 --> 18:41.370
You are the best thing
that has ever happened
to me on every level.

18:41.453 --> 18:44.206
I love you so much.

18:44.289 --> 18:47.417
And after this,
everything will be perfect.

18:47.501 --> 18:49.837
[sighs wearily] Ivy, I'm...

18:51.380 --> 18:53.841
I am so happy
you found that confidence

18:53.924 --> 18:55.968
I always knew was inside of you

18:56.051 --> 18:58.387
and it makes me
happier than anything.

18:58.470 --> 19:02.099
But this, this is wrong.

19:02.182 --> 19:03.809
It is not what we talked about.

19:03.892 --> 19:05.269
Wait, what? What do you mean?

19:05.352 --> 19:07.688
Like, this is Eden.
This is our plan.

19:07.771 --> 19:10.232
-Our dream.
-Innocent people are dying.

19:10.315 --> 19:12.609
That was not part of the plan.

19:14.778 --> 19:16.864
Well, Harley, plans change.

19:16.947 --> 19:19.241
You know, like,
that's what I'm doing.

19:19.324 --> 19:20.742
This is what I want.

19:20.826 --> 19:22.744
I'm sorry that
you can't get on board,

19:22.828 --> 19:24.246
but I'm following through.

19:24.329 --> 19:28.500
Something I always thought
that you wanted me to do.

19:29.501 --> 19:33.213
Dear God! Why?

19:33.297 --> 19:35.340
I thought I was over this.

19:36.216 --> 19:37.426
Calm down.

19:37.509 --> 19:38.844
Call Cherise.

19:38.927 --> 19:42.431
She said to do this
for any therapy emergency.

19:42.514 --> 19:44.391
-[cell phone ringing]
-[zombie grunting]

19:44.474 --> 19:48.103
Cherise, I know you said
not to approach you
outside of sessions.

19:48.186 --> 19:51.899
But I am having
a therapy emergency.

19:51.982 --> 19:55.903
Ivy, I love you
and this might be your Eden,

19:55.986 --> 19:57.988
but it's not mine.

19:59.114 --> 20:01.033
[groans]

20:01.116 --> 20:02.951
[both gasp]

20:03.035 --> 20:08.957
Harley, you sacrificed
yourself for me?

20:09.041 --> 20:12.169
I can finally forgive you
and move on.

20:12.252 --> 20:14.504
Forget the stupid pasta maker.

20:14.588 --> 20:16.882
-Harley!
-[screaming]

20:20.969 --> 20:22.971
[Bruce] It's just Selina
breaking it off

20:23.055 --> 20:25.098
and that movie about my dad.

20:25.182 --> 20:27.142
I'm usually so good
at pushing my emotions down,

20:27.225 --> 20:29.811
but this left me with
an excruciating emptiness.

20:29.895 --> 20:32.147
Oh. It sounds like
a tough couple of weeks.

20:32.230 --> 20:34.232
[sighs softly] Sure has been.

20:34.316 --> 20:37.069
I just missed my parents
so much and thought
bringing them back

20:37.152 --> 20:38.862
would give me
the closure I needed.

20:38.946 --> 20:42.866
I didn't think it would lead
to a [sighs] zombie apocalypse.

20:42.950 --> 20:44.159
It's an honest mistake.

20:44.242 --> 20:45.869
But as much
as I wish it wasn't true,

20:45.953 --> 20:47.663
my parents are dead.

20:47.746 --> 20:48.747
I can't change that.

20:49.623 --> 20:51.833
But I can fix this.

20:53.919 --> 20:55.837
Wait. You don't have to.

20:55.921 --> 20:57.547
No, I do.

20:57.631 --> 20:59.424
I brought all this
upon the city.

20:59.508 --> 21:01.510
It's my cross to bear.

21:01.593 --> 21:02.803
Ironic, isn't it?

21:02.886 --> 21:04.012
I spent the last 30 years

21:04.096 --> 21:05.180
mourning the loss
of my parents,

21:05.263 --> 21:06.556
and I'll spend the next 30

21:06.640 --> 21:08.058
grieving their second death
at my hands.

21:08.141 --> 21:10.769
Are you sure?
Because I'll do it for you.

21:10.852 --> 21:11.812
Seriously?

21:13.063 --> 21:15.148
You know,
I'd really appreciate that.

21:15.232 --> 21:19.528
Uh, you're going
to want to look away
and cover your ears.

21:24.491 --> 21:26.910
[screaming]

21:26.994 --> 21:28.996
Harley, why did you do this?

21:29.079 --> 21:33.959
I can't, I can't change
you back without...

21:34.042 --> 21:35.919
Without undoing everything.

21:36.003 --> 21:38.046
Oh. Thank God I was...

21:38.130 --> 21:41.049
I was hoping that
was how it worked,

21:41.133 --> 21:46.930
but I didn't know exactly what
the plant magic rules were.

21:47.014 --> 21:48.140
-[screams]
-Harley!

21:51.560 --> 21:52.811
[screaming]

22:01.945 --> 22:02.779
Shit.

22:04.740 --> 22:05.615
[sighs]

22:06.366 --> 22:07.367
Are you okay?

22:08.243 --> 22:09.077
[grunts]

22:09.745 --> 22:10.662
Good.

22:19.504 --> 22:25.218
Fuck!

22:25.302 --> 22:27.387
[theme music playing]
