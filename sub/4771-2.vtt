00:04.920 --> 00:06.081
Previously on "Power"...

00:06.240 --> 00:08.527
When Nomar was dying,
he told me who stabbed him.

00:08.680 --> 00:10.568
Angela, a federal prosecutor.

00:10.720 --> 00:12.165
A goddamn
United States Attorney.

00:12.360 --> 00:15.364
I know about you and your track record
on this Lobos case.

00:15.520 --> 00:17.375
You're not only no longer leading
the Lobos task force,

00:17.400 --> 00:18.640
you're not on it at all.

00:18.800 --> 00:20.720
Angela, there was a shooting
tonight at the club.

00:20.840 --> 00:23.002
- Oh, my God, Jamie, are you...
- I'm okay.

00:23.160 --> 00:24.650
What if that bullet
was meant for you?

00:24.800 --> 00:26.240
With Ghost alive,
the best way for me

00:26.280 --> 00:28.080
to approach this is
to attack from the inside.

00:28.105 --> 00:30.447
And I got a man already planted
in the organization.

00:30.600 --> 00:32.567
My son. He'll tell me anything
I want to know.

00:32.759 --> 00:34.640
- The shooter?
- I called some friends in Miami.

00:34.800 --> 00:36.165
Sent them a picture of this.

00:36.320 --> 00:37.935
Make sure you look
at more than Miami, Julito.

00:37.960 --> 00:39.335
She's got to have some kind
of connection locally,

00:39.360 --> 00:41.681
- someone with resources.
- I want my down payment.

00:41.840 --> 00:43.763
Okay. I can give you your money.

00:43.920 --> 00:46.048
But she ran.
I don't know where she is.

00:46.200 --> 00:48.640
Tommy, where the fuck are you, man?
A lot of shit popping off.

00:48.665 --> 00:49.526
It's about Holly.

00:49.680 --> 00:52.081

You leaving me already, beautiful?
I only been an hour.

03:36.440 --> 03:38.408
Make me feel like a booty call.

03:38.560 --> 03:42.246
You're not a booty call.
I left you a hundred on the dresser.

03:42.400 --> 03:43.811
Only a hundred?

03:43.960 --> 03:46.406
I'm insulted.

03:47.560 --> 03:49.324
Seriously, where you headed?

03:49.480 --> 03:52.006
Something special
happening at work?

03:52.160 --> 03:54.925
No, not at all.
I'm going for a run.

03:55.080 --> 03:56.800
I got to keep this
all tight for you, right?

03:56.825 --> 04:00.082
- You're perfect.
- Thank you.

04:00.240 --> 04:03.562
That's sweet.

04:38.960 --> 04:42.328
All right.
Well, it's nice to see you out here.

04:43.320 --> 04:44.760
You haven't been out here
in a while.

04:44.785 --> 04:46.050
Yeah, I missed it.

04:46.200 --> 04:49.488
- Helps me sort things out.
- Oh, yeah.

04:49.680 --> 04:52.411
Look, I know Mike said
you can't talk about Lobos,

04:52.600 --> 04:55.490
but, I mean, he's not gonna
find out out here, right?

04:55.640 --> 04:58.962
I'm fantastic, Angela.
Thank you for asking. Jesus.

04:59.120 --> 05:01.441
Greg, I'm sorry.

05:01.600 --> 05:04.251
How long are you
going to be mad at me?

05:04.400 --> 05:05.970
Mea culpa, okay?

05:06.120 --> 05:08.441
I mean, can we get past it?

05:25.920 --> 05:27.560
So where you want me
to take you, Uncle G?

05:28.920 --> 05:31.605
Wait right here.
I'll tell you when to go.

05:39.200 --> 05:41.043
Quantico.

05:42.960 --> 05:44.928
That motherfucker's FBI.

05:49.040 --> 05:50.087
I'd rather do...

05:50.280 --> 05:52.328
- Just a sec.
- Okay.

05:56.520 --> 05:58.602
This is Angela Valdes.
I can't take...

05:58.760 --> 06:01.331
- So come on, tell me.
- What?

06:01.480 --> 06:03.608
You guys getting close
to anything?

06:03.800 --> 06:05.882
Yeah, we're making some headway.

06:06.040 --> 06:08.361
And that's basically
all I'm gonna say.

06:08.520 --> 06:11.205
Angie, I wanna see you
again this week.

06:11.360 --> 06:13.203
So leave the key
with your doorman

06:13.360 --> 06:15.480
and I'll come over
and I'll cook dinner for you, okay?

06:15.505 --> 06:16.651
See you soon.

06:16.800 --> 06:18.689
I promise I won't
ask you anything else

06:18.840 --> 06:20.729
about Mike or Saxe or Lobos...

06:20.880 --> 06:23.281
if you beat me to 86th Street.

06:27.640 --> 06:29.244
Fuck!

06:29.400 --> 06:30.890
Let's go, Shawn.

06:33.320 --> 06:35.368
All right,
so Soldados picked up.

06:35.520 --> 06:36.965
Tainos got the carriers out.

06:39.800 --> 06:43.850
But we're gonna need the RSKs
or somebody else on board

06:44.000 --> 06:46.731
if we're gonna make
a serious dent here.

06:54.080 --> 06:57.084
Any news on the shooter?
Give me something, Julito.

06:57.240 --> 06:59.527
I put word out
to my Miami connect.

07:05.960 --> 07:08.361
I'm gonna hit you
as soon as I find out.

07:12.600 --> 07:14.841
L just got in from Ibiza.

07:15.000 --> 07:16.843
It's cocktail hour there.

07:17.000 --> 07:19.401
Forgive me for celebrating.

07:19.560 --> 07:22.928
It's just so lovely that we're going
to be spending so much time together.

07:23.080 --> 07:24.764
I didn't agree to anything yet.

07:24.960 --> 07:26.320
You own the building,
not the club.

07:26.360 --> 07:29.489
Yes, for now that's true.

07:29.640 --> 07:32.120
But I think it's in
your best interest

07:32.280 --> 07:35.966
if you allow me to absorb Truth
as part of my brand.

07:36.120 --> 07:38.646
I'll buy in, become your partner,
and since I own the building,

07:38.800 --> 07:40.802
there goes that pesky rent cost.

07:40.960 --> 07:42.610
Then there's all
the other benefits.

07:42.760 --> 07:46.003
Bigger budgets for parties.
Access to my guest lists.

07:46.160 --> 07:48.561
My relationship with the media.

07:48.720 --> 07:50.529
My expertise.

07:50.680 --> 07:53.126
It's the partnership
you always wanted.

07:53.320 --> 07:57.484
Except, you know, technically
I would be in charge.

07:58.640 --> 08:00.369
What do you want from me

08:00.520 --> 08:03.205
in exchange for your generosity?

08:03.360 --> 08:06.648
You'll run the place just like you did
when you owned it outright.

08:06.800 --> 08:09.041
You know, what you do

08:09.200 --> 08:12.044
with the music
and the mix of people.

08:12.200 --> 08:14.441
Except now you'll report
directly to me.

08:14.600 --> 08:16.364
Simon.

08:16.520 --> 08:18.648
Or I can terminate your lease

08:18.800 --> 08:21.246
and you can take the Truth name

08:21.400 --> 08:25.564
and find another space,
build it out, get it permitted...

08:25.720 --> 08:27.290
if you have the money
to do that.

08:27.480 --> 08:30.051
But I think we both know
that you don't.

08:34.240 --> 08:37.642
Okay. I'll work for you.

08:38.799 --> 08:41.451
But I want to know exactly
how and when to buy you out.

08:41.600 --> 08:43.169
The terms of your freedom?

08:43.320 --> 08:46.051
Yes. Yes, Simon.
The terms of my freedom.

08:48.280 --> 08:51.045
You get this place running
at 20% profit, I'll give you a number.

08:51.200 --> 08:53.123
And if I have that number?

08:53.280 --> 08:56.807
Cash. No financing.
Banks are so tedious.

08:56.960 --> 08:59.486
So if I have your number, cash,

08:59.680 --> 09:02.240
you're telling me you'll sell your stake
back to me, no bullshit?

09:02.320 --> 09:04.368
No bullshit.

09:04.560 --> 09:06.244
How come I don't believe you?

09:06.440 --> 09:09.569
I think it's a cultural thing.

09:09.720 --> 09:11.529
To Truth.

09:11.680 --> 09:13.489
To Truth.

09:13.640 --> 09:16.962
Are we done here, "sir"?

09:17.120 --> 09:18.531
Oh, yes. Go ahead, take it.

09:18.680 --> 09:20.682
We'll chat.

09:28.240 --> 09:29.605
So how was your run?

09:29.760 --> 09:31.171
Good, thanks.

09:33.320 --> 09:36.005
You got my message?
Does that sound good to you?

09:36.160 --> 09:37.810
Of course it does.

09:37.960 --> 09:39.530
I'll leave the key
with the doorman.

09:39.720 --> 09:41.449
But you don't have
to give it back.

09:41.640 --> 09:43.642
It's yours. You can keep it.

09:43.800 --> 09:45.848
So I can have a key
to your house permanently?

09:46.000 --> 09:48.207
What if you come home
and I'm sitting on your couch

09:48.360 --> 09:50.966
in my boxers watching ESPN?

09:51.120 --> 09:52.884
Are you kidding?
I would love it.

09:53.040 --> 09:54.371
That's exactly what I want.

09:54.520 --> 09:57.922
Okay, baby, you got it.

10:01.680 --> 10:05.685
When I find that bitch Rolla hired,
I'm gonna kill her. Twice.

10:05.800 --> 10:07.960
Wouldn't even be going
to the hospital if she hadn't...

10:07.985 --> 10:10.247
We'll find her.
Then we'll confirm whether Rolla did it.

10:10.400 --> 10:13.131
Rolla fucking did it.
I told you that shit.

10:13.280 --> 10:16.602
The shit you need to confirm
is what the fuck is up

10:16.800 --> 10:19.565
with Angie-from-the-block
turned fucking Fed.

10:22.040 --> 10:23.680
The night you saw her,
walk me through it.

10:23.705 --> 10:25.887
Walk me through the whole night.

10:26.040 --> 10:28.725
Ruiz asked me to ice
one of his soldiers.

10:28.880 --> 10:30.245
Asshole named Nomar.

10:30.440 --> 10:32.966
Sticking it to Ruiz's
14-year-old kid.

10:33.120 --> 10:34.565
Yeah.

10:34.720 --> 10:37.200
Ruiz swore loyalty to us
for doing it.

10:37.400 --> 10:39.482
Ruiz says motherfucker's
gonna be at this park.

10:39.640 --> 10:41.802
He is, he gets a call,
gets spooked.

10:41.960 --> 10:44.281
Heads out to Queens.

10:44.440 --> 10:48.809
I stabbed that motherfucker.
One, two, three.

10:49.000 --> 10:50.843
Went down easy.

10:51.040 --> 10:53.725
Then your girlfriend comes running in
screaming his name.

10:53.920 --> 10:56.844
Calls for backup.
Says, "This is AUSA Angela Valdes."

10:57.000 --> 10:58.411
My Cl's been stabbed."

10:58.560 --> 11:02.849
So this Nomar cat,
he was Angela's informant.

11:03.000 --> 11:05.810
What if Ruiz makes him, sends you
to kill him, you get caught,

11:05.960 --> 11:07.689
- two birds, one stone?
- What?

11:07.840 --> 11:10.525
- Ruiz met with Lobos, remember?
- Yeah.

11:10.680 --> 11:13.000
To move us the fuck out of the way,
Tommy. I'm just saying.

11:13.025 --> 11:15.280
What if he set you up
with a time and a place,

11:15.480 --> 11:17.847
you get there, the target
fucking gets a phone call

11:18.000 --> 11:19.411
when you're supposed to do him,

11:19.560 --> 11:21.400
then he leads you on
a fucking wild-goose chase

11:21.425 --> 11:23.446
all over town, you end up
right in Angela's lap?

11:23.600 --> 11:24.886
You think he set me up?

11:25.040 --> 11:26.610
We suspected Ruiz's shit before.

11:26.760 --> 11:28.535
He's been playing straight
with us the whole time.

11:28.560 --> 11:31.040
Maybe, man, but look. You know
I don't believe in coincidences.

11:31.120 --> 11:33.200
And right now, coincidentally,
the motherfucker's out

11:33.357 --> 11:35.917
selling our product while asking
for a goddamn seat at the table.

11:35.942 --> 11:38.530
And what's worse,
we can't fucking make a move on him,

11:38.680 --> 11:40.284
'cause we fucking need him.

11:40.440 --> 11:43.569
We got product collecting dust
in a fucking warehouse.

11:43.760 --> 11:46.650
RSK is playing hardball.
Still not on board yet.

11:46.800 --> 11:48.370
What should I think?
You tell me.

11:48.560 --> 11:50.961
Maybe we should talk to Drifty
out in Jersey.

11:52.480 --> 11:54.642
Yeah, maybe we should.

11:54.800 --> 11:56.802
We're almost here.

11:56.960 --> 11:59.486
Let me just get Holly settled
and we'll head out there.

11:59.640 --> 12:01.130
- All right?
- All right.

12:14.000 --> 12:16.082
You haven't been returning
any of my calls.

12:16.240 --> 12:17.651
You threw me
out of your apartment.

12:19.480 --> 12:21.926
You're right. Look, Paz,

12:22.080 --> 12:24.970
this thing with Jamie,
it's a mess, okay?

12:25.120 --> 12:27.930
But I love him. He loves me.

12:28.080 --> 12:29.764
And I need to share that
with you.

12:29.920 --> 12:32.082
I need you to be
a part of my life, too.

12:32.240 --> 12:33.924
I just don't want you
to get hurt.

12:42.360 --> 12:43.964
It's just...

12:46.840 --> 12:49.411
Whenever I think we're getting close
to getting somewhere,

12:49.560 --> 12:51.801
he pulls back.

12:51.960 --> 12:53.530
I sound stupid.

12:58.440 --> 12:59.851
How was Miami?

13:00.000 --> 13:02.162
We didn't go.

13:02.320 --> 13:04.084
But he's making me
dinner tonight.

13:05.840 --> 13:08.889
Is it worth it?
Is it worth putting your life on hold

13:09.040 --> 13:10.690
for a man you barely know?

13:10.840 --> 13:13.764
We've known each other
our entire lives.

13:13.920 --> 13:17.049
In a way, we know each other
better than anyone else ever could.

13:23.080 --> 13:25.447
It's easy to love someone

13:25.600 --> 13:27.602
when you only see them
an hour a day.

13:36.160 --> 13:38.000
All right, look, Tommy,
when you talk to Holly,

13:38.040 --> 13:40.240
you got to sell it, okay?
It was just a random shooting.

13:40.265 --> 13:42.680
Some crazy bitch disgruntled
she couldn't get in the club.

13:42.880 --> 13:45.520
- She can't know it was a hit.
- Yeah, I wouldn't tell her nothing.

13:45.545 --> 13:49.231
You sure about that?
She called me "Ghost," Tommy.

13:50.160 --> 13:52.162
Where'd she get that from,
Tommy?

13:52.320 --> 13:55.051
What the fuck is that, man?

13:55.200 --> 13:57.089
How could you say anything
about our business?

13:57.240 --> 13:59.800
What the hell were you thinking?
I've known you 25 fucking years.

13:59.840 --> 14:01.680
You ain't never
put our business in the street.

14:01.760 --> 14:04.764
- Holly ain't the fucking street.
- Holly looked me in my face.

14:04.920 --> 14:07.287
She called me "Ghost"
in a club full of people.

14:07.440 --> 14:09.363
She didn't give a fuck.
That ain't street, Tommy?

14:09.520 --> 14:11.761
Okay, I fucked up.
But I can handle my woman,

14:11.920 --> 14:14.161
just like you can handle Angie.

14:14.320 --> 14:17.130
Tommy, I've known Angie
for 20 years.

14:17.280 --> 14:19.280
You've known this girl
30 seconds compared to that.

14:19.360 --> 14:21.727
- I know her well enough.
- Then know this well enough.

14:21.920 --> 14:24.840
She opened her mouth to me, Tommy,
she'll open her mouth to somebody else.

14:24.989 --> 14:26.832
She says the wrong thing
to the wrong person,

14:27.029 --> 14:29.604
she gets hurt.
You do the math, brother.

14:29.800 --> 14:32.804
I get it. I got you.

14:32.960 --> 14:35.964
Hey. How you doing?

14:37.240 --> 14:39.163
I got it. Beat it.

14:42.880 --> 14:44.882
So here's Anibal.

14:45.040 --> 14:47.168
Primera of the
Hermanos Tainos. Dead.

14:47.360 --> 14:50.091
Here's Vibora Ruiz,
stabbed and left to bleed out.

14:50.280 --> 14:52.806
He survived.
But this guy, Rolla,

14:52.960 --> 14:55.804
head of the Rock Street Killers,
was gunned down in cold blood.

14:55.960 --> 14:58.120
And your working theory
was that Lobos' New York distro

14:58.200 --> 15:00.168
- was cleaning house?
- Something like that.

15:00.320 --> 15:03.051
But the Nomar murder
seems off-trend somehow.

15:03.200 --> 15:05.280
I'm not totally convinced
that the Nomar Arcielo kill

15:05.305 --> 15:08.965
was part of the pattern here.
I know Angela Valdes thought so.

15:09.120 --> 15:10.884
It was hard for me to believe.

15:11.040 --> 15:14.203
Agreed.
Here are three broken families.

15:14.360 --> 15:16.601
Deaths like these
make people want revenge.

15:16.760 --> 15:19.650
Make them want to talk.
QDubs, the new head of Rock Street,

15:19.800 --> 15:22.690
was questioned by NYPD.
Didn't say a word.

15:22.840 --> 15:25.969
Ruiz is old school.
Knows better.

15:26.120 --> 15:29.567
I was thinking
we should try... him.

15:29.720 --> 15:31.882
According to NYPD Gang Squad,

15:32.040 --> 15:35.647
this man, Diego Martinez, who goes
by the street name "Cristobal,"

15:35.800 --> 15:37.962
is the new head of the Tainos.

15:38.160 --> 15:40.208
I'm thinking he might
have something to say.

15:40.360 --> 15:41.960
If we spook Cristobal
by bringing him in,

15:42.040 --> 15:43.280
doesn't that work against us?

15:43.440 --> 15:45.363
If Lobos gets wind,
he could just eliminate

15:45.520 --> 15:47.640
all these witnesses and then
we'll have nowhere to go.

15:47.665 --> 15:50.843
Our investigation in LA proved
that Lobos knows we're after him.

15:51.000 --> 15:53.082
Still got to do business.

15:53.240 --> 15:55.208
Okay, Coop, it's your show.

15:55.360 --> 15:57.408
Knox, go get Cristobal.

16:04.680 --> 16:06.808
I made sure nobody followed me.

16:25.320 --> 16:26.810
It's my fault he's dead.

16:31.240 --> 16:34.847
You didn't hold the knife.

16:35.000 --> 16:38.083
Do you think putting the man
who killed Nomar in prison

16:38.240 --> 16:40.288
would make you feel better,

16:40.440 --> 16:43.364
knowing that you made Nomar's killer
pay for what he did?

16:43.560 --> 16:45.688
Need more coffee here?

16:45.840 --> 16:47.888
Thank you.

16:51.080 --> 16:52.206
No.

16:57.360 --> 17:01.046
I can put Nomar's killer in jail
for the rest of his life

17:01.200 --> 17:03.441
if you help me.

17:06.400 --> 17:08.367
I can't.

17:08.520 --> 17:10.204
You mean because
your father ordered it?

17:14.200 --> 17:16.009
I don't want your dad.

17:16.160 --> 17:19.003
I want the man
who stabbed Nomar.

17:25.359 --> 17:27.761
He would have visited
your father a few times

17:27.920 --> 17:30.446
in the weeks before
Nomar's death.

17:30.600 --> 17:32.728
Someone your father
thought was important.

17:37.240 --> 17:39.686
Nomar tried to help me
with this drawing, Isabel.

17:43.440 --> 17:46.284
Don't you want to finish
what he started?

17:51.120 --> 17:52.929
- Take it slow, baby.
- I'm fine. I'm fine.

17:53.080 --> 17:55.367
Take it slow.
I know you're fine.

17:55.520 --> 17:56.840
All right,
I'm gonna put you here.

17:56.865 --> 17:58.689
All right, sit down, be careful.

17:58.840 --> 18:00.888
Holly, you need that thing.

18:01.040 --> 18:02.724
Okay, tough guy-

18:04.120 --> 18:06.851
What are you doing?

18:07.000 --> 18:09.606
Baby, you shouldn't be drinking wine
with the painkillers.

18:09.760 --> 18:13.810
That's funny coming from you.

18:13.960 --> 18:16.042
It's gonna take
a lot more than a bullet,

18:16.240 --> 18:19.005
a few drinks,
and a pill to take me down.

18:23.400 --> 18:27.007
Holly, something I need
to talk to you about.

18:27.160 --> 18:28.605
What is it, Tommy?

18:35.720 --> 18:37.802
It can wait.

18:41.800 --> 18:45.043
It's nice to be here with you.

18:45.200 --> 18:47.601
When I woke up, I was scared.

18:47.760 --> 18:49.250
I didn't see you.

18:49.400 --> 18:51.129
I'll never let anybody
hurt you again.

18:51.280 --> 18:53.442
You hear me?

18:57.280 --> 18:59.282
I swear. I promise you that.

18:59.440 --> 19:01.283
Never.

19:01.440 --> 19:03.727
I'll fucking kill anybody
who even thinks about it.

19:03.880 --> 19:07.089
When I heard
about you getting...

19:07.240 --> 19:10.403
hurt, I went crazy
like a motherfucker.

19:13.960 --> 19:16.042
It all went down so fast.

19:18.760 --> 19:20.649
What happened?

19:20.840 --> 19:22.683
I don't remember anything.

19:25.080 --> 19:28.209
Some fucking loser
crazy chick got in the club.

19:28.360 --> 19:30.840
Drugged up. Took some shots.

19:31.000 --> 19:33.000
Wanted someone to pay
for her not being on the list

19:33.025 --> 19:35.027
or some shit like that.

19:39.320 --> 19:41.049
<i>Sorry.</i>

19:42.760 --> 19:44.922
Oh, fuck.

19:45.120 --> 19:46.884
I got to do a run, babe.

19:47.080 --> 19:48.605
Out in Jersey.

19:48.760 --> 19:50.489
I'll be back.

20:07.800 --> 20:10.610
The Loa speak to me, Fantome.

20:10.760 --> 20:13.161
What the fuck are you talking about?
Stop speaking Haitian.

20:13.320 --> 20:14.970
How does your Loa consult you?

20:15.120 --> 20:17.600
They say there are many birds
on the branches

20:17.760 --> 20:19.569
and I am left
to starve on the dirt.

20:19.720 --> 20:21.440
Yo, your lolos think
you getting a bum deal?

20:21.465 --> 20:23.840
There are many people
who want access to my network.

20:24.000 --> 20:26.844
I will need to keep a bigger cut
than we have previously discussed.

20:27.000 --> 20:28.331
35%.

20:28.480 --> 20:30.801
Straight-up deal.

20:30.960 --> 20:33.691
Pure product. You cut it
as many ways as you like.

20:33.840 --> 20:36.923
25%, straight quarters.
The best we can offer.

20:37.080 --> 20:40.004
I believe in you.

20:41.560 --> 20:43.403
But the ancestors say
I can do better.

20:43.560 --> 20:46.325
Great. Ghost, you wanna
cut on the fucking lights now?

20:53.160 --> 20:56.004
The ancestors say
you will be back.

21:00.120 --> 21:01.804
- We can't afford it.
- Yeah, no shit.

21:01.960 --> 21:03.371
I'll hit up the Serb.

21:14.400 --> 21:17.210
You're standing funny, man.
I can tell you packing from a mile away.

21:19.640 --> 21:22.007
Yeah, well,
I ain't used to it yet.

21:25.640 --> 21:29.008
I need you to take me
to your Uncle G house.

21:29.160 --> 21:31.320
Good. 'Cause I'm sick of pretending
that you ain't out.

21:31.440 --> 21:33.249
You got some more
pretending to do.

21:33.400 --> 21:34.970
Ghost can't know I've been out.

21:35.120 --> 21:36.880
Can't know nothing
you know about me, a'ight?

21:36.905 --> 21:38.131
Yeah, I know.

21:38.280 --> 21:39.645
You secure that weapon.

21:39.800 --> 21:41.689
Make sure you don't
"Plaxico" yourself...

21:41.840 --> 21:43.763
Drop the shit
and get shot out here.

21:47.400 --> 21:49.243
So how's your boy doing?

21:49.400 --> 21:51.721
Tommy moved Holly
into his place.

21:51.880 --> 21:55.009
Tommy playing nursemaid?

21:55.160 --> 21:56.810
I never thought I'd see that.

21:57.000 --> 22:00.891
And what's worse is this fool
told this girl about our business.

22:01.040 --> 22:02.530
She called me Ghost.

22:02.680 --> 22:04.330
That basic bitch.

22:04.480 --> 22:06.323
You know, Tommy's a fool
for gapping off.

22:06.480 --> 22:08.926
We got to control her, T.
You know, keep her safe.

22:09.080 --> 22:10.600
Make her feel like
she's on the inside,

22:10.760 --> 22:12.640
like she can turn to us
if something goes wrong.

22:12.665 --> 22:16.040
I'm gonna tell you something else.
She ain't gonna buy it from me.

22:16.200 --> 22:17.884
All right. I'll talk to her.

22:18.040 --> 22:20.247
Thanks, T.

22:20.440 --> 22:23.603
- What's up, Uncle G?
- Shawn, what up?

22:23.760 --> 22:26.286
Hey. What's up, G?
Family back in the house.

22:28.520 --> 22:31.251
What the hell?

22:31.400 --> 22:35.041
Kanan motherfucking Stark
in my goddamn living room.

22:35.200 --> 22:36.850
- What you do, break out?
- Nah, man.

22:37.040 --> 22:38.724
I walked out legal. All done.

22:38.880 --> 22:40.405
I thought you had a year left.

22:40.560 --> 22:43.564
- Good behavior.
- Good behavior?

22:43.720 --> 22:45.961
Tasha, am I seeing things?

22:46.120 --> 22:47.849
I can't believe you here.

22:48.000 --> 22:50.082
Me either, G.
10 years is a long time.

22:50.240 --> 22:51.890
It's good to see you, Kanan.

22:52.040 --> 22:54.040
- Don't he look good?
- You haven't changed at all.

22:54.065 --> 22:56.048
Hi. You did.

22:56.200 --> 22:57.929
You were just a little kid
when I went in.

22:58.080 --> 23:00.048
Look like you filled out
in all the right places.

23:00.200 --> 23:01.690
- Hey, man.
- My bad, G.

23:01.840 --> 23:04.366
I ain't been around
a lot of women in a while.

23:04.520 --> 23:07.560
It's all 'hood, man. Shawn, why didn't
you tell us your pops was getting out?

23:07.716 --> 23:09.596
- I didn't know.
- I didn't give him no warning.

23:09.621 --> 23:11.010
They just told me yesterday.

23:11.200 --> 23:12.964
You want to, you know...
You want to crash?

23:13.160 --> 23:14.924
You need a place to stay?
We got you, man.

23:15.120 --> 23:16.720
- We got plenty of room.
- I'm good, man.

23:16.745 --> 23:18.190
You did enough for me
on the inside.

23:18.280 --> 23:20.123
I just hope I get
a chance to pay you back.

23:20.280 --> 23:21.964
Come on, least I could do.

23:23.040 --> 23:24.690
Damn.

23:24.880 --> 23:28.441
Y'all living like "George and Weezie"
for real. Look at this.

23:28.600 --> 23:30.523
No. What...?

23:30.720 --> 23:32.484
You knew he was gonna do it.

23:32.680 --> 23:34.250
Damn.

23:34.400 --> 23:35.925
Y'all did better without me

23:36.080 --> 23:37.960
than y'all would have did
with me on the street.

23:41.640 --> 23:43.802
I hope Tasha hurry up
with that grub, man.

23:43.960 --> 23:45.849
I know she burn like
a motherfucker, right?

23:46.000 --> 23:47.490
Come on, man,
you know she got you.

23:47.640 --> 23:50.564
You remember she can cook?
I'm a lucky man, K.

23:50.720 --> 23:52.722
You are. Shawn told me
about that shit

23:52.880 --> 23:54.882
that went on at the club
the other night.

23:55.040 --> 23:57.480
- You could be a dead man.
- Yeah, that's some shit, ain't it?

23:57.505 --> 23:59.647
- Yeah.
- And the fucked-up thing is

23:59.800 --> 24:01.680
Rolla was already dead
before the hitter showed.

24:01.835 --> 24:04.155
It makes me wonder whether Rolla
even ordered the hit, man.

24:04.180 --> 24:05.768
That's bullshit.

24:05.960 --> 24:08.241
He could have ordered that call
before he took the bullet.

24:08.266 --> 24:09.285
I don't know, man.

24:09.440 --> 24:11.329
Man, why you acting like
you so surprised, man?

24:11.480 --> 24:14.051
You raised Rolla. You wrote
the blueprint for his moves, man.

24:14.200 --> 24:15.884
Why wouldn't he want
to take out the boss?

24:16.040 --> 24:18.566
It's the same shit
you did to Breeze.

24:21.240 --> 24:23.083
Living large
up in this penthouse

24:23.240 --> 24:26.050
done made you lose your mind
or some shit, man?

24:26.200 --> 24:28.567
Come on, man, ain't no friends
out here on these streets.

24:28.720 --> 24:30.927
Niggas is hungry,
looking for their next meal.

24:31.080 --> 24:32.605
They wanna take it from you.

24:32.760 --> 24:35.411
All of them. Rolla, too.

24:35.560 --> 24:37.562
You know when a nigga wants
something a nigga got,

24:37.720 --> 24:39.484
that nigga want you dead.

24:39.640 --> 24:42.007
You worried about
that hitter coming back?

24:42.160 --> 24:44.367
'Cause I can make a few calls.
I got some connects.

24:44.520 --> 24:46.887
- We'll find the bitch, man.
- No, I already covered it.

24:47.040 --> 24:50.123
You know, got somebody
out there looking for her, K.

24:53.200 --> 24:55.521
All right, well, I'm here.

24:55.720 --> 24:58.690
- Just say the word.
- I appreciate it, man.

24:58.840 --> 25:01.571
All that money you put on my books,
I feel like I owe you, man.

25:01.720 --> 25:04.929
Come on, man, I already told you.
It's the least I could do.

25:05.080 --> 25:07.560
- I heard the fucking news.
- Oh, man.

25:07.720 --> 25:09.688
- Welcome back, bro.
- Look at this nigga.

25:12.120 --> 25:14.521
Shit, look who it is, motherfucker.

25:14.680 --> 25:16.045
Damn, you look good, K.

25:16.240 --> 25:17.560
Your cracker ass got big as shit.

25:17.585 --> 25:19.528
- I'm a late bloomer.
- You still crazy?

25:19.680 --> 25:21.080
You better believe it,
motherfucker.

25:21.120 --> 25:23.441
- Look at this.
- How's business?

25:23.600 --> 25:26.206
It's not so good.
We got some problems with the RSK.

25:26.360 --> 25:28.135
Hey, man, we can talk
about business anytime, all right?

25:28.160 --> 25:30.128
K just got out, man.
We got to take care of him...

25:30.280 --> 25:32.080
High style, right?
We gonna throw him a party.

25:32.105 --> 25:34.566
- Tommy, tell him what we gonna do.
- Now you talking.

25:34.760 --> 25:37.440
We're gonna throw you one with
the biggest <i>asses</i> you have ever seen.

25:37.560 --> 25:39.722
- That's still your shit, right?
- Damn straight.

25:41.960 --> 25:44.247
But listen, I gotta get going.
Make a few stops and shit.

25:44.400 --> 25:46.482
I just went to go see my moms,
came straight here.

25:46.640 --> 25:47.880
All right, man.

25:50.120 --> 25:51.281
Stay in touch.

25:56.920 --> 25:59.002
Time's up, motherfucker.
Where's your bitch?

25:59.200 --> 26:00.486
Gotta find her first.

26:00.640 --> 26:02.290
Hold on. Hold on. Hold on.
Listen! Listen!

26:02.440 --> 26:03.855
I got people looking for her.
I gotta find her first.

26:03.880 --> 26:05.120
Look, just listen, all right?

26:05.280 --> 26:06.884
Look, I can't get
a location on her, man.

26:07.080 --> 26:08.335
She hasn't answered her phone.
No one's seen her.

26:08.360 --> 26:09.680
It's like she fucking
disappeared.

26:09.705 --> 26:11.887
The problem is
if somebody finds you,

26:12.040 --> 26:14.160
what guarantees me you gonna
tell them the same story?

26:14.185 --> 26:16.766
Just give me a chance.

26:16.920 --> 26:19.440
You gonna cry like a bitch,
I'm gonna make you suck it like one.

26:19.465 --> 26:21.771
Open your mouth.
Open your fucking mouth.

26:21.920 --> 26:22.967
Open your mouth!

26:29.320 --> 26:30.720
Don't act like
it's your first time.

26:30.840 --> 26:33.684
L just left a bunch of punks
like you in the joint.

26:33.840 --> 26:36.161
I'll do anything you want.

26:36.360 --> 26:38.522
Please,

26:38.680 --> 26:41.490
I have a family, man.
I have little kids.

26:41.640 --> 26:43.240
You should have tried
harder to find her.

26:43.265 --> 26:44.471
Fucking punk.

26:48.240 --> 26:50.686
I don't give a fuck
who your connect is.

26:50.840 --> 26:53.127
I'll give you a better price.

26:53.280 --> 26:55.408
Make you money.

26:55.560 --> 26:58.131
Some things are worth
more than money.

26:59.920 --> 27:02.571
Oh, yeah? Like what?

27:02.760 --> 27:05.843
Like my life.
My children's lives.

27:06.000 --> 27:08.321
Milan would not take
my defecting easily.

27:08.520 --> 27:10.249
You scared of this motherfucker?

27:10.440 --> 27:12.408
What?

27:12.560 --> 27:15.643
Milan makes people
into fucking cevapi.

27:16.920 --> 27:20.402
It's grinded meat with tomatoes.

27:20.560 --> 27:22.483
He's like cannibal.

27:22.640 --> 27:25.291
I will not betray him, Tommy.

27:29.440 --> 27:31.727
Remind me not to eat
at this fucking joint.

27:57.520 --> 27:59.363
Holly, baby.

27:59.520 --> 28:01.522
I got to be out of town
for a few days.

28:01.680 --> 28:05.480
I'll call you,
but I don't know when.

28:05.640 --> 28:07.244
I love you, okay?

28:07.400 --> 28:09.289
I love you, Holly.

28:17.600 --> 28:20.206
Hey, Holl, I know
you don't recognize this number,

28:20.360 --> 28:22.966
but could you call me back
as soon as you get this?

28:23.120 --> 28:26.329
I need you to come meet me
outside the city.

28:26.480 --> 28:29.802
I'll explain when you get here.

28:42.320 --> 28:43.765
That motherfucker was fresh.

28:43.920 --> 28:45.684
Talking about a day or less.

28:45.840 --> 28:48.525
She probably did it.
Make sure we couldn't find her.

28:48.615 --> 28:50.455
That would mean
she was still in town yesterday

28:50.480 --> 28:52.680
and I ain't buying that.
I think the bitch is long gone.

28:52.705 --> 28:54.363
Yeah, well, either way,
the trail is cold.

28:54.520 --> 28:57.091
I still got my people looking
for her in Miami. Nothing yet.

28:57.240 --> 28:58.685
Well, keep us fucking posted.

28:58.880 --> 29:00.644
In the meantime,
there's this to deal with.

29:03.000 --> 29:06.083
Shit. When Lobos
said twice the product...

29:06.240 --> 29:09.084
More than that.
We need more help moving it, man.

29:09.240 --> 29:10.844
Drifty's fucking price
is too high.

29:11.000 --> 29:12.889
We got to dig in our pockets
to make ends meet.

29:13.040 --> 29:14.371
What happened with the Serb?

29:14.560 --> 29:16.562
It's a no-go.
He won't drop his connect.

29:16.720 --> 29:18.484
He said the motherfucker
eats people.

29:18.640 --> 29:20.921
Yeah, I heard of that guy.
Yeah, I ain't fucking with him.

29:21.000 --> 29:23.287
Well, for now,
I guess neither are we.

29:23.440 --> 29:25.647
Still nothing from QDubs? RSKs?

29:25.800 --> 29:28.081
Neither of them. As long
as Ruiz is on board, they aren't.

29:28.106 --> 29:30.486
You think we can get the Tainos
to move more weight?

29:30.640 --> 29:33.086
Cristobal is young, he's hungry.

29:33.240 --> 29:35.686
I could make that happen.
I'll set up a meet.

29:39.040 --> 29:41.441
Tasha, this is so nice.

29:41.600 --> 29:44.206
You didn't have to do all this.

29:44.360 --> 29:47.045
Well, Lord knows you can't cook
in your condition.

29:47.200 --> 29:49.407
And we all know
Tommy can't cook a can of soup.

29:49.560 --> 29:51.164
Okay?

29:51.320 --> 29:53.766
How are you feeling?

29:53.920 --> 29:56.400
Okay, I guess.

29:56.600 --> 29:58.682
- On the mend.
- Good.

29:58.840 --> 30:00.604
We wanted you to get
the best doctors.

30:00.760 --> 30:02.444
The best everything.

30:02.600 --> 30:04.680
You know, my husband,
he paid all your medical bills,

30:04.705 --> 30:07.444
so you're free and clear.
You don't owe the hospital a penny.

30:07.600 --> 30:10.649
As an employee of Truth,
I was covered,

30:10.800 --> 30:13.929
but I thank you
for your generosity.

30:14.120 --> 30:16.168
Look, you're with Tommy.

30:16.320 --> 30:18.402
That means you're family, okay?

30:18.560 --> 30:22.565
So anything that
happened before now,

30:22.720 --> 30:25.246
it's all in the past.

30:26.600 --> 30:28.284
I appreciate that.

30:28.440 --> 30:30.681
I know Tommy wants us
all to get along.

30:30.840 --> 30:33.207
I think everyone wants that.

30:34.720 --> 30:37.849
Tasha, what happened
that night at the club?

30:38.000 --> 30:40.731
I know you weren't there.
Did James tell you?

30:40.880 --> 30:43.008
Same story as on the news.

30:43.160 --> 30:46.801
Some crazed, drugged-up girl wanted
to get revenge for not getting in.

30:46.960 --> 30:49.770
You know how it is.
Let me give you my cell

30:49.920 --> 30:52.571
just in case you need anything.

30:52.720 --> 30:55.291
I'm a big girl.
I can take care of myself.

30:57.840 --> 30:59.729
I know.

30:59.880 --> 31:01.480
I actually think
you and I are more alike

31:01.560 --> 31:04.131
than I originally thought.

31:04.280 --> 31:06.169
I think so, too.

31:13.760 --> 31:16.604
You know, it was nice of you
to go see Tommy's girl.

31:16.760 --> 31:19.650
She belongs with Tommy.
She's family.

31:19.800 --> 31:22.121
How you doing?

31:23.120 --> 31:25.327
Shawn, just talk.
What do you want to know?

31:25.480 --> 31:27.448
I want to know how you are.

31:27.600 --> 31:30.444
I want to know if we could
talk sometime.

31:35.800 --> 31:38.246
Look, Shawn,

31:38.400 --> 31:40.402
I think I made
a mistake with you.

31:40.560 --> 31:42.120
I mean, you know
what I'm talking about.

31:42.145 --> 31:44.525
I was a little emotional and...

31:44.680 --> 31:48.401
I said and did some things
that you may have misunderstood.

31:48.560 --> 31:50.483
Misunderstood?

31:52.960 --> 31:55.327
Ghost and I are in
a really good place right now.

31:55.480 --> 31:58.962
I just don't want you
to be confused.

31:59.120 --> 32:01.009
Yeah, no...

32:01.160 --> 32:03.686
I'm sorry. I've gotta take this.
This is important.

32:03.840 --> 32:06.286
Hey, Keisha.

32:06.480 --> 32:07.970
I told you Kadeem was trippin'.

32:08.120 --> 32:10.009
You need to leave
his broke ass alone.

32:10.160 --> 32:13.050
The place already looks better
since you entered the front door, James.

32:13.240 --> 32:15.561
What's this?

32:15.720 --> 32:18.485
I'm sending you on a little trip
for the weekend.

32:18.640 --> 32:21.211
You like Miami, right?

32:21.360 --> 32:24.204
I need you to get these contracts
signed for me.

32:24.360 --> 32:26.727
Why can't you get your lawyers
to send these directly?

32:26.920 --> 32:29.651
I'm all about the human touch.

32:29.840 --> 32:33.447
And I think you have the right
personality, charm, muscle

32:33.600 --> 32:35.762
to convince anyone to do
what you want them to do.

32:35.920 --> 32:37.880
You're saying it's gonna be hard
to convince them?

32:37.905 --> 32:39.927
I'm saying you're
the right man for the job.

32:40.080 --> 32:42.811
Just tell them how much
you love working with me

32:42.960 --> 32:46.043
and what a great partner I am.
That should do it.

32:46.200 --> 32:49.249
- You can do that, right?
- Right.

32:49.440 --> 32:53.809
Mr. Kantos. I guess I shouldn't be
surprised to see you here.

32:53.960 --> 32:55.121
You two are quite the pair.

32:55.320 --> 32:56.600
Good to see you again,
Mr. Stern.

32:56.640 --> 32:58.722
So long, James.

32:58.880 --> 33:01.486
Be sure to come back
from Miami with a tan.

33:05.320 --> 33:08.369
- Miami?
- As his errand boy.

33:08.520 --> 33:10.124
Look, we're officially
back to work.

33:10.280 --> 33:12.203
I want you to get me
Lincoln Center's angels list

33:12.360 --> 33:14.840
and the contributor names
to WBLS immediately.

33:15.000 --> 33:16.764
Those lists don't seem
to go together.

33:16.920 --> 33:18.880
Well, I'm building the best
night out in New York.

33:18.905 --> 33:20.922
I want the uptown crowd
with the downtown crowd.

33:21.080 --> 33:22.525
I want Park Avenue money

33:22.680 --> 33:24.240
and the bodega owners
partying together.

33:24.265 --> 33:26.766
I want the rich,
the famous, and the freaks.

33:26.920 --> 33:30.720
Don't you ever forget, Kantos,
the famous want to be entertained, too.

33:30.880 --> 33:32.962
Maybe you should get that
approved by Stern first.

33:35.400 --> 33:38.483
Stern doesn't know what the fuck
he wants until you give it to him.

33:38.640 --> 33:40.881
I'm making Stern
all the money he wants

33:41.080 --> 33:43.208
while getting
my fucking club back

33:43.360 --> 33:46.523
and shoving my foot up his ass.
You good with that?

33:46.680 --> 33:49.001
Sure thing, boss.

33:54.480 --> 33:57.529
Okay, how do you
want me to go at him?

33:57.720 --> 34:01.008
I don't want you
to do anything at all.

34:13.040 --> 34:14.963
What are the charges?

34:15.120 --> 34:17.600
We both know what you do.

34:17.760 --> 34:20.081
But I'm not here
to talk about you.

34:20.280 --> 34:22.806
I want your connect,
Felipe Lobos.

34:23.960 --> 34:25.246
Who?

34:25.400 --> 34:27.322
The man who's
probably responsible

34:27.480 --> 34:29.130
for the death
of your brother Anibal.

34:29.280 --> 34:32.443
I should thank him.

34:32.600 --> 34:34.409
Gave me a promotion.

34:34.560 --> 34:37.449
I don't care about
your street-level drug bullshit.

34:37.600 --> 34:39.204
I want the source.

34:39.360 --> 34:41.328
You help me,
I'll take out your competition.

34:41.480 --> 34:44.165
Arrest every DDP I can find.

34:44.320 --> 34:47.402
You mean like you motherfuckers
did to Whitey Bulger?

34:49.600 --> 34:52.251
What, I can't watch
the History Channel?

34:52.440 --> 34:54.408
Then you get it. Quid pro quo.

34:54.560 --> 34:57.005
You help me, I help you.

34:59.280 --> 35:03.444
Like I said, man,
I don't know a Felipe Lobos.

35:03.600 --> 35:06.331
Fine. Where do you
get your supply from?

35:06.480 --> 35:08.608
Your distro, I'll talk to him.

35:08.760 --> 35:10.842
Let's say I have some idea
what you're talking about.

35:11.040 --> 35:14.647
Let's say I did have a distro.

35:16.840 --> 35:18.410
Why would I give him to you?

35:20.720 --> 35:23.007
He goes out,
where do I get my drugs?

35:23.160 --> 35:25.242
You're not gonna get those
for me, too, right?

35:27.360 --> 35:29.647
Anibal had his own way
of doing shit.

35:29.800 --> 35:33.521
Under me, the Tainos
are a community organization.

35:33.680 --> 35:37.082
Speaking of which, I've gotta
get back to my community.

35:37.280 --> 35:39.123
So unless you're actually
gonna charge me...

35:39.320 --> 35:42.608
Fine.

35:42.760 --> 35:46.003
But this isn't the last time
we're going to talk, Cristobal.

35:52.360 --> 35:54.647
I know you said
you didn't know anything,

35:54.800 --> 35:58.122
but, you know,
I was just wondering

35:58.280 --> 36:01.011
if you ever heard
of a white guy distro.

36:01.160 --> 36:03.128
Goes by the name "Ghost."

36:05.320 --> 36:08.164
White guy named Ghost?

36:10.800 --> 36:13.451
That's like a fucking cartoon.

36:13.600 --> 36:16.763
- Get out.
- Okay.

36:35.800 --> 36:38.087
Where you been, bro?
I've been looking all over for you.

36:38.240 --> 36:41.289
Had to go out of town for a while.
Caught some unexpected heat.

36:41.440 --> 36:43.408
From that favor
I asked you to do?

36:43.560 --> 36:45.244
I'm sorry about that.

36:45.400 --> 36:48.449
It's time for you to do a favor
for me in return.

36:48.640 --> 36:50.722
I need you to make good
with QDubs.

36:50.880 --> 36:52.484
Fresh start.

36:52.640 --> 36:55.962
I ain't bowing and scraping
to those low-life RSKs.

36:56.120 --> 36:58.487
It's payback time
and I'm here to collect.

36:59.680 --> 37:02.524
You said we was brothers
for life.

37:03.520 --> 37:06.285
Unless that was bullshit.

37:08.640 --> 37:12.281
We are, Tomas, but the RSKs
paid that bitch to stab me.

37:12.440 --> 37:14.090
You know it and I know it.

37:14.240 --> 37:16.481
And we killed Rolla.
So you got your revenge.

37:16.640 --> 37:18.927
You need to make peace
with QDubs.

37:19.080 --> 37:21.845
We need to get right.
We need everybody on board.

37:22.000 --> 37:23.968
And as long as there's
bad blood between y'all,

37:24.120 --> 37:26.043
we got problems
selling our shit.

37:29.080 --> 37:31.606
I killed Nomar, Ruiz.

37:33.440 --> 37:36.649
I spilled his blood for you.

37:36.800 --> 37:39.724
Now you do this for me.

37:39.880 --> 37:41.644
Hey.

37:41.800 --> 37:43.643
We ran the sketch
through facial recognition

37:43.800 --> 37:46.201
and I must say I think our bad guy
is pretty hot.

37:46.360 --> 37:47.771
I'm just saying.

37:47.920 --> 37:49.840
Here are all the possible
matches for the sketch.

37:49.865 --> 37:51.833
- Great. Thanks.
- You're welcome.

37:57.280 --> 37:58.964
Tommy?

38:02.000 --> 38:03.809
Greg.

38:09.280 --> 38:11.601
- Yeah?
- Get in here.

38:15.520 --> 38:17.966
I have a sketch of the person
who killed Nomar,

38:18.120 --> 38:20.160
but I need to hear the tapes
to verify my instincts.

38:20.185 --> 38:21.400
Slow down.

38:21.560 --> 38:23.608
Just run that by me again
in English, please.

38:23.760 --> 38:27.048
There were eight matches from
the facial recognition cross-match

38:27.240 --> 38:29.320
and one of them was a guy
I went to high school with.

38:29.360 --> 38:32.045
If I can just hear the tapes,
I can tell if it's his voice.

38:32.240 --> 38:33.571
How did you finish the sketch?

38:35.160 --> 38:36.446
Isabel Ruiz.

38:38.240 --> 38:40.360
Well, see, that's crazy,
because she's a minor, right?

38:40.440 --> 38:42.360
And I know you couldn't
get permission from Ruiz,

38:42.385 --> 38:44.322
so did you follow
victim-witness protocols?

38:44.480 --> 38:46.209
Counseling, protection.

38:46.360 --> 38:48.362
She can call me anytime
she needs me, day or night.

38:48.520 --> 38:50.921
Right, 'cause that worked out
for Nomar, right?

38:51.080 --> 38:52.923
I can't believe
you're still pursuing this.

38:53.080 --> 38:54.684
No. No. No.

38:54.840 --> 38:56.649
I will not help you.
Mike said no.

38:56.800 --> 38:58.480
You need to let it go
before you get fired.

38:58.600 --> 39:00.125
Just do the work
Mike put you on.

39:00.280 --> 39:02.760
That's bullshit work
and you know it.

39:02.920 --> 39:05.127
Right.

39:05.320 --> 39:08.642
You would get me the tapes
if I was still fucking you.

39:10.680 --> 39:12.887
You're right, yeah.
I probably would, Angela.

39:13.040 --> 39:16.328
But, see, we're not still fucking,
so cut the shit.

40:09.240 --> 40:12.369
What was the name
of your stupid dog?

40:15.280 --> 40:17.282
Grace.

40:19.000 --> 40:20.729
Bingo.

40:31.680 --> 40:35.605
I'm gonna find that girl
and cancel Christmas on her ass.

40:39.200 --> 40:42.363
I'm gonna find that girl
and cancel Christmas on her ass.

40:45.800 --> 40:48.724
She canceled Christmas
on your boy with her quickness.

42:11.680 --> 42:14.160
Hey, smells great.

42:17.520 --> 42:19.568
Looks good, too.

42:19.760 --> 42:21.285
Jamie?

42:22.360 --> 42:24.089
Jamie?

42:24.240 --> 42:26.686
Hey, baby. Everything okay?

42:26.840 --> 42:30.162
Yeah. Yeah.

42:32.680 --> 42:34.523
So I'm opening Truth
tomorrow night,

42:34.680 --> 42:37.047
but in order to do it,
I had to agree to work for Stern

42:37.240 --> 42:39.846
as his errand boy for a while.

42:40.000 --> 42:42.367
I understand that.

42:42.520 --> 42:45.364
I got humiliated at work,
too, by my new boss.

42:46.800 --> 42:48.962
He assigned me to a new team.

42:49.120 --> 42:51.282
Work I don't care about.

42:53.440 --> 42:55.886
Well, Stern is sending me to Miami
to sign contracts.

42:58.000 --> 42:59.365
I want you to come with me.

43:01.520 --> 43:03.284
With all that's going on
with work right now,

43:03.440 --> 43:05.647
I don't know
if I can get time off.

43:05.800 --> 43:08.326
Angie, this was our dream.

43:08.520 --> 43:10.921
We said we'd wake up in Miami
together, remember?

43:11.080 --> 43:13.526
And I want to go, I do.

43:13.680 --> 43:19.164
I just can't say for sure.

43:45.400 --> 43:48.131
Let's just make this easy, okay?

43:48.280 --> 43:50.248
Both go home,

43:50.400 --> 43:52.368
no problems, right?

44:05.920 --> 44:08.082
You're so quiet.

44:09.080 --> 44:10.445
Something up?

44:10.600 --> 44:13.046
No, nothing, really.

44:13.200 --> 44:15.407
Just work stuff.

44:15.560 --> 44:17.801
Want to talk about
what's going on at work?

44:17.960 --> 44:19.849
No, not really.

44:20.000 --> 44:21.650
It wouldn't help.

44:24.960 --> 44:27.008
Jamie, I'm sorry.

44:27.160 --> 44:29.401
You made such a nice meal.

44:29.600 --> 44:31.807
You're great.

44:31.960 --> 44:34.247
It's just... it's been
such a long day.

44:34.440 --> 44:37.011
Is it okay if we don't tonight?

44:37.160 --> 44:40.528
I think I need
to go to bed alone.

44:48.760 --> 44:51.411
Angela doesn't have
anything on us.

44:51.560 --> 44:54.245
No files, wiretaps,
phone records.

44:54.400 --> 44:55.970
- Nothing.
- You sure?

44:56.120 --> 44:57.884
I just came from her apartment.

44:58.040 --> 44:59.360
I did find some
good news, though.

44:59.440 --> 45:00.726
What the fuck does that mean?

45:00.920 --> 45:02.360
Well, what it means
is I found a file

45:02.514 --> 45:03.845
on Nomar and I found his phone.

45:04.034 --> 45:06.200
He was a Cl working
for her, yes.

45:06.360 --> 45:08.089
Nothing to do with us.

45:08.240 --> 45:10.368
So Ruiz was telling
the truth about Nomar,

45:10.560 --> 45:12.767
which means
that we can trust Ruiz.

45:12.920 --> 45:14.843
So if Ruiz makes good
with the RSKs...

45:15.000 --> 45:16.445
And everything holds
with Drifty,

45:16.600 --> 45:18.762
then we might just
pull this shit off.

I'm ready to work.

46:04.440 --> 46:06.568
See, I thought you were
trying to go legit.

46:06.720 --> 46:08.855
I told Tommy, I said, "Yo,
he's trying to become a citizen."

46:08.880 --> 46:11.320
- Wear a suit and tie?
- You know, the whole thing. What's up?

46:11.345 --> 46:13.851
Fuck, I'm supposed to work
on Wall Street or some shit?

46:14.040 --> 46:16.281

I'm ready to hustle.

46:16.440 --> 46:17.930
Yeah, well, we got
a lot going on.

46:18.080 --> 46:19.640
And we could use
your help on all of it.

46:19.795 --> 46:20.956
We want you back on the team.

46:21.155 --> 46:23.440
- Right, Ghost?
- Right, right.

46:23.600 --> 46:26.604
- That's good to hear, man.
- Now get back out there, K.

46:26.800 --> 46:29.326
Enjoy it. You see that shit?
It's all paid for.

46:29.480 --> 46:32.211

46:44.800 --> 46:46.768
Been out of the game
for a minute, man, come on.

46:46.920 --> 46:48.520
Let him catch up to speed.
What the fuck?

46:48.545 --> 46:53.646
Yo, Ghost, it's Kanan.
He practically raised us.

46:53.800 --> 46:56.041
Look, time inside
changes people.

46:56.200 --> 46:58.202
We got to get to know him again.

47:02.160 --> 47:04.208
Get the fuck outta here.

47:05.360 --> 47:07.283
Oh, shit.

47:14.360 --> 47:16.089
Oh, shit. My bad.

47:16.240 --> 47:18.015
- I'm gonna be outside.
- No, motherfucker. Come here.

47:18.040 --> 47:20.160
I need you... hold on...
I need you to give me a ride.

47:20.230 --> 47:22.470
Yeah, Dad, no, I got you,
but I'm gonna be outside, okay?

47:22.495 --> 47:24.107
I'm gonna be done in a minute.

47:26.080 --> 47:27.650
Oh, damn, girl.

47:27.800 --> 47:30.326
Trying to suck my whole
motherfucking dick.

47:30.480 --> 47:34.121
Shorty got skills.

47:34.280 --> 47:38.080
Go ahead. It's you.
Get in there.

47:38.240 --> 47:40.160
No, Dad, I'm good.
We can just get up outta here.

47:40.185 --> 47:41.969
Man, go ahead, man.

47:42.120 --> 47:44.691
Should be a while, too.
I'm gonna wait on you. Go ahead.

47:44.880 --> 47:46.644
Boy, if you don't
get in there...

47:46.840 --> 47:48.683
I want this place
in shape for tonight.

47:48.880 --> 47:52.089
- Come on, let's get on it.
- Looking good in here.

47:52.240 --> 47:53.765
Simon.

47:53.920 --> 47:55.206
I always like seeing you,

47:55.360 --> 47:57.408
but I'm okay without
adult supervision.

47:57.600 --> 48:01.286
Well, about that.
There's been a slight change

48:01.480 --> 48:03.642
in our arrangement
that just couldn't be helped.

48:03.695 --> 48:05.575
I wanted to come down
and tell you face-to-face.

48:05.600 --> 48:07.080
What kind of change
you talking about?

48:07.105 --> 48:08.729
Instead of reporting
directly to me,

48:08.880 --> 48:11.087
you'll be reporting
to the new general manager.

48:14.280 --> 48:16.328
- We had a deal.
- True.

48:16.480 --> 48:19.768
But you have to stay fluid
in the nightclub business.

48:19.920 --> 48:22.446
You know that.
There's no need to worry, James.

48:22.600 --> 48:25.490
I think you will like
the new GM.

48:29.200 --> 48:30.531
Hey, boss.

48:30.680 --> 48:33.604
You don't have to call him
that anymore.

48:36.360 --> 48:38.169
Angie, it's Jamie.

48:38.320 --> 48:40.971
I sent you a text,
I didn't hear back.

48:41.120 --> 48:43.009
Just wondering
if you're gonna be

48:43.160 --> 48:45.561
on that plane to Miami
with me tonight.

48:45.720 --> 48:48.564
Call me back.

48:58.360 --> 49:00.681
Hello? Angela Valdes.

49:00.840 --> 49:03.889
Hey, sweetie, it's Darryl.
So, James St. Patrick is clean.

49:04.080 --> 49:06.321
He has no criminal record.

49:06.480 --> 49:08.482
Thank you.

49:23.080 --> 49:24.684
What's going on?

49:24.840 --> 49:27.241
Hey, Tash.
I have to go to Miami.

49:27.440 --> 49:29.841
Alone?

49:30.000 --> 49:31.604
Yeah.

49:31.760 --> 49:35.048
I got some business
I gotta do for Stern.

49:35.240 --> 49:37.402
I'm not seeing her anymore.
This is just business.

49:37.560 --> 49:39.403
I'm not taking Angela.

49:40.400 --> 49:42.402
Hey-

49:45.960 --> 49:49.328
The girl who shot up the club,
Tash, she's in Miami.

49:49.480 --> 49:52.643
I'm going to take care
of that situation by myself.

49:52.840 --> 49:55.411
Use this Stern business
as a cover.

49:57.160 --> 49:59.811
Well, whatever you need
to get it done...

50:02.880 --> 50:06.168
I'm here to support you,
all right?

50:07.200 --> 50:09.601
<i>L</i> 9011 you.

50:09.760 --> 50:12.081
Come here.

50:34.080 --> 50:36.128
Come here.

50:39.240 --> 50:42.642
How you doing, baby?
You didn't overdo it, did you?

50:42.800 --> 50:45.121
No, haven't done much at all.

50:46.400 --> 50:49.882
Tasha brought some food over.

50:50.040 --> 50:52.486
Damn, it's like Christmas.

51:00.880 --> 51:04.805
I asked her what happened
that night at the club.

51:04.960 --> 51:07.440
You know what's funny?

51:07.600 --> 51:11.730
She had the same
exact story as you.

51:11.920 --> 51:13.365
Yeah, 'cause that's
what happened.

51:13.520 --> 51:15.807
And then I got my cell

51:15.960 --> 51:18.531
and I listened to the messages
you left me.

51:20.560 --> 51:23.882
You were scared, Tommy.
And you didn't know that I was hurt.

51:24.040 --> 51:27.761
Tommy, if you're gonna
hide stuff from me,

51:27.920 --> 51:31.208
I'm out.
I'm not gonna play house.

51:31.360 --> 51:33.727
I'm all in or nothing.

51:33.880 --> 51:35.882
The cunt was trying
to hit Ghost.

51:36.040 --> 51:37.880
We had problems with people
taking shots at us,

51:37.905 --> 51:39.530
but it's all under control now.

51:39.680 --> 51:43.287
The guy that ordered
the hit is gone.

51:43.440 --> 51:47.161
Why did you lie to me
in the first place?

51:47.320 --> 51:50.085
Ghost asked you to lie,
didn't he?

51:51.200 --> 51:52.565
Yes, he did.

51:52.720 --> 51:54.480
Because you fucking
looked at him in his face

51:54.560 --> 51:56.164
- and called him "Ghost."
- No, I...

51:56.320 --> 51:58.295
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I told you
that shit in confidence, Holly.

51:58.320 --> 52:00.120
And then you went straight
to the motherfucker

52:00.240 --> 52:02.521
and gapped off like it was nothing.
How could you do that?

52:02.546 --> 52:04.243
I told him I was quitting.

52:04.400 --> 52:07.085
Because you told me to.

52:07.240 --> 52:09.322
He got rough with me.

52:09.520 --> 52:12.171
He grabbed me and so
I thought of the first thing

52:12.320 --> 52:15.051
that I could think of
to get him to stop.

52:19.720 --> 52:22.451
You're gonna leave now, too,
aren't you?

52:22.600 --> 52:25.683
Told you, everyone leaves me.

52:34.640 --> 52:36.005
Nah.

52:36.160 --> 52:38.731
I ain't going nowhere.

52:50.400 --> 52:52.920
I'm really uncomfortable with the way
that went down with James.

52:52.945 --> 52:55.570
Oh, come on.
The look on his face was priceless.

52:55.720 --> 52:59.725
I know you respect James,
like him, even.

52:59.880 --> 53:02.451
That's not going to get in the way
of you doing your job, right?

53:02.600 --> 53:05.763
No, sir. Of course not.

53:05.920 --> 53:08.366
Good. He can never
reach 20% profit.

53:08.520 --> 53:10.600
Do what you have to do
to make sure it never happens.

53:10.640 --> 53:14.645
- I'm not sure about that.
- Josh, we talked about this.

53:14.800 --> 53:16.802
We keep James,
we learn his tricks,

53:17.000 --> 53:19.321
then send him on his merry way.

53:19.480 --> 53:23.849
Then I will give you Truth.
Your own club.

53:24.000 --> 53:26.446
Like your past was washed away.

How did Stern know

54:30.280 --> 54:31.840
I was planning to open
a Truth in Miami?

54:33.920 --> 54:35.524
I thought so.

54:37.000 --> 54:39.241
Is that Tommy over there?

54:39.400 --> 54:41.528
He's not welcome in the club.

54:41.680 --> 54:43.250
Stern doesn't want
that element inside.

54:43.400 --> 54:45.641
Stern has you on a tight leash?

54:45.840 --> 54:48.320
I see he has you
trained well already.
