Somehow I feel as though

05:04.890 --> 05:06.514
we should all look away.

05:06.515 --> 05:08.642
Or they should get a cabin.

05:32.146 --> 05:33.208
I have my passport.

05:37.879 --> 05:39.380

05:39.381 --> 05:41.022

05:51.560 --> 05:53.019
- Well, it was all
- a waste of time.

05:53.022 --> 05:54.375
While you were plummeting

05:54.376 --> 05:55.729
back to Earth,

05:55.730 --> 05:56.836
I heard Lou say Gladys

05:56.837 --> 05:57.940
controls the Wi-Fi router

05:57.941 --> 05:58.984
and only activates it

05:58.985 --> 06:00.025
on Sunday.

06:00.026 --> 06:01.508
Great! How are we going

06:01.509 --> 06:02.987
to build a router?

06:02.988 --> 06:04.761
And if we did, it would

06:04.762 --> 06:06.532
have to be like 20 feet high.

06:06.533 --> 06:08.075
This tree is perfect.

06:08.076 --> 06:09.995
- It must be like
- 20 feet high.

06:16.084 --> 06:17.668

06:17.669 --> 06:19.338

06:19.339 --> 06:21.005
to build our dreamcatchers.

06:21.006 --> 06:22.132
Good point. We're gonna need

06:30.015 --> 06:31.600
You really think I would

06:31.601 --> 06:33.184
fall for Kuryakin's gambit?

06:33.810 --> 06:35.728
You just did.

06:35.729 --> 06:37.480
Checkmate, son!

06:40.525 --> 06:42.381
Forget the 6-year-olds.

06:42.382 --> 06:44.236
We just hit the nerd jackpot.

06:44.237 --> 06:45.988
Ravi and Tiffany?

06:45.989 --> 06:47.240
Problem is, those

06:47.241 --> 06:48.491
goody-four-shoes

06:45.989 --> 06:48.490
would never break a rule.

06:48.491 --> 06:50.369
They might, if they don't know

06:50.370 --> 06:52.244
they're breaking a rule.

06:52.245 --> 06:54.079
Ahhh.

06:54.080 --> 06:55.832
- So we're going to break - the rules
by having them - Break the rules,

06:55.833 --> 06:57.167
- But they won't know
- they're breaking the rules,

06:57.170 --> 06:58.877
- So that way - we don't get caught
- Breaking the rules.

06:58.880 --> 07:00.294
You got it!

07:00.295 --> 07:02.256
- Not really. - I have no idea
- What I just said.

07:03.256 --> 07:04.654
I still cannot believe

07:04.655 --> 07:06.050
you beat me.

Guys, good news.

07:07.385 --> 07:09.053
You're telling me.

07:09.054 --> 07:10.555

- Ravi at chess...

07:10.558 --> 07:12.182
Again.

07:13.558 --> 07:15.352
The sun was in my eyes.

07:16.311 --> 07:18.103
Zuri, what happened to you?

07:18.104 --> 07:19.438
BOTH: Uh...

07:19.439 --> 07:21.149
She got mugged by a clown.

07:22.484 --> 07:24.674
Anyhoo, we heard there's

07:24.675 --> 07:26.862
a new arts and crafts project.

07:26.863 --> 07:28.386
You get to build

07:28.387 --> 07:29.907
a wireless router!

07:29.908 --> 07:31.575
Yes, that's right.

07:31.576 --> 07:32.640
From whatever

07:32.641 --> 07:33.703
you can scrounge up

07:31.576 --> 07:33.702
from around the camp.

07:33.703 --> 07:35.810
Wow, that is quite a leap

07:35.811 --> 07:37.916
from the pine cone wind chime

07:33.703 --> 07:37.916
we made last week.

07:39.125 --> 07:40.294
This assignment came

07:40.295 --> 07:41.460
straight from Gladys.

07:41.461 --> 07:43.317
She thought you guys

07:43.318 --> 07:45.173
were the only two

07:41.461 --> 07:45.172
smart enough to handle it.

07:45.173 --> 07:48.092
Well, she's right about that.

07:48.093 --> 07:49.303
It'll be nice to finally

07:49.304 --> 07:50.512
have a challenge.

07:51.262 --> 07:52.304
I agree.

07:52.305 --> 07:54.181
Now, keep this under wraps

07:54.182 --> 07:55.622
because you're the only two

07:55.623 --> 07:57.059
who get the pleasure

07:57.060 --> 07:59.125
of this special electrical

07:59.126 --> 08:01.188
engineering assignment.

08:01.189 --> 08:02.566
And Gladys doesn't want

08:02.567 --> 08:03.942
the other campers

08:01.189 --> 08:03.941
to get jealous.

08:03.942 --> 08:05.276
- Got it!
- I'm in!

08:06.736 --> 08:08.218
Later I'm gonna sell

08:08.219 --> 08:09.697
them the Brooklyn Bridge.

08:09.698 --> 08:11.241
- Do we own that?
- (GASPS)

08:15.245 --> 08:16.620
Okay, little bros,

08:16.621 --> 08:17.893
let's go over my

08:17.894 --> 08:19.164
sweet totem pole design.

08:19.165 --> 08:21.333
Why do we need a design?

08:21.334 --> 08:22.482
Once we're out there,

08:22.483 --> 08:23.627
just toss me a chainsaw

08:23.628 --> 08:27.047
and watch the wood chips fly!

08:27.048 --> 08:28.801
If I gave you a chainsaw,

08:28.802 --> 08:30.552
the only things

08:27.048 --> 08:30.551
that would be "flying"

08:30.552 --> 08:31.970
would be

08:31.971 --> 08:33.386
other campers' fingers.

08:33.388 --> 08:35.077
And I'm not going to have

08:35.078 --> 08:36.765
my totem pole covered

08:33.388 --> 08:36.765
in stray body parts.

08:36.765 --> 08:38.038
Now, each section is

08:38.039 --> 08:39.308
a different animal,

08:39.309 --> 08:40.561
which represents a cabin.

08:40.562 --> 08:42.438
I'd rather carve

08:42.440 --> 08:44.314
an alien, or a dragon.

08:44.315 --> 08:46.130
Or Katie

08:46.131 --> 08:47.943
from trampoline class.

08:47.944 --> 08:50.114
Actually, for this totem pole,

08:50.115 --> 08:52.282
I want us to capture

08:47.944 --> 08:52.281
the camp experience.

08:52.282 --> 08:53.804
Katie is the best part

08:53.805 --> 08:55.326
of my camp experience.

09:01.750 --> 09:03.335
Wow, they are

09:03.336 --> 09:04.918
really into this.

09:04.919 --> 09:06.651
Neither one of them

09:06.652 --> 09:08.380
has spoken in two hours.

09:08.381 --> 09:10.841
Just enjoy it.

09:10.842 --> 09:12.136
I finished the specs

09:12.137 --> 09:13.427
for the electrical system.

09:13.428 --> 09:15.346
- You have my permission
- to be impressed.

09:17.140 --> 09:18.474
Wait just a nanosecond,

09:18.475 --> 09:20.143
you are proposing

09:20.144 --> 09:21.810
a triple band processor?

09:21.811 --> 09:23.604
Those are unreliable,

09:23.605 --> 09:24.940
which you would know,

09:24.941 --> 09:26.273
had you read my latest article

09:26.274 --> 09:28.442
in Computer Science Magazine.

09:28.443 --> 09:31.676
(SCOFFS) I didn't read it

09:31.677 --> 09:34.908
because nobody reads

09:28.443 --> 09:34.907
magazines anymore, Gramps!

09:34.908 --> 09:37.160
Besides, last year I made

09:37.161 --> 09:39.412
a super particle accelerator

09:34.908 --> 09:39.411
for my science fair.

09:39.412 --> 09:41.455
I made one of those, too.

09:41.456 --> 09:43.957
In kindergarten.

09:43.958 --> 09:45.440
Nerd trash talk

09:45.441 --> 09:46.920
is the saddest trash talk.

09:54.094 --> 09:55.721
Hey, Lou.

09:55.722 --> 09:57.346
Did you find the phone?

09:57.347 --> 09:58.348
Nope.

09:58.349 --> 09:59.349
But I did find this.

09:59.350 --> 10:01.727
What is that?

10:01.728 --> 10:04.104
I don't know, but I think

09:59.349 --> 10:04.103
I should get some shots.

10:04.104 --> 10:05.856
Meanwhile, the only thing

10:05.857 --> 10:07.607
Hazel's done is frisk

10:04.104 --> 10:07.606
Xander, five times.

10:07.607 --> 10:09.234
XANDER: (YELLS) Hazel,

10:09.235 --> 10:10.860
that is not a pocket!

10:11.528 --> 10:13.779
Make that six times.

10:13.780 --> 10:15.220
Hey, you know,

10:15.221 --> 10:16.657
with Emma's help,

10:16.658 --> 10:17.784
you could split up

10:17.785 --> 10:18.909
and cover more ground.

10:18.910 --> 10:20.245
She can search our cabin,

10:20.246 --> 10:21.578
while you search...

10:21.579 --> 10:22.871
Anywhere else.

10:22.872 --> 10:24.082
Great plan, Zuri!

10:24.083 --> 10:25.290
(SNIFFS)

10:25.291 --> 10:26.481
Uh, I think I'll go

10:26.482 --> 10:27.669
get that shot.

10:29.003 --> 10:30.651
Zuri, are you trying

10:30.652 --> 10:32.297
to get us in trouble?

10:32.298 --> 10:34.154
If I search our cabin,

10:34.155 --> 10:36.010
I'll find the phone, because

10:32.298 --> 10:36.010
I know where we hid it.

10:37.887 --> 10:39.097
I'd say you got hit

10:39.098 --> 10:40.305
in the head by a tetherball,

10:40.306 --> 10:42.225
- but you were like this
- when we came.

10:48.398 --> 10:49.483
Zuri, I'm really

10:49.484 --> 10:50.566
worried about this.

10:50.567 --> 10:52.651
Relax. It's perfect.

10:52.652 --> 10:54.195
Now you're in

10:54.196 --> 10:55.737
on the investigation.

10:55.738 --> 10:56.782
Two words.

10:56.783 --> 10:57.824
Frame. Jorge.

10:58.783 --> 10:59.992
I can't do that!

10:59.993 --> 11:01.535
Okay, two more words.

11:01.536 --> 11:02.536
Frame. Xander.

11:04.455 --> 11:06.291
- No, Zuri.
- No framing.

11:10.128 --> 11:11.901
That is it! I am going

11:11.902 --> 11:13.673
to tell Gladys I cannot

11:10.128 --> 11:13.672
build her a router!

11:13.673 --> 11:15.299
No, you can't do that!

11:15.300 --> 11:17.177
Well, I cannot work with

11:17.178 --> 11:19.052
crazy braids over here.

11:19.053 --> 11:20.888
She is impossible!

11:20.889 --> 11:22.140
Oh, don't get your

11:22.141 --> 11:23.391
adult diaper in a bunch.

11:25.101 --> 11:26.957
Guys, you have to put aside

11:26.958 --> 11:28.812
your dorky differences.

11:28.813 --> 11:31.398
Gladys is counting on you.

11:31.399 --> 11:32.776
Besides, you don't

11:32.777 --> 11:34.152
want Tiffany to think

11:31.399 --> 11:34.151
you're a quitter, do you?

11:34.152 --> 11:35.652
I never quit.

11:35.653 --> 11:37.530
- Remember when we used
- to play hide and seek?

11:37.533 --> 11:39.532
- And I would hide
- for hours and hours,

11:39.535 --> 11:41.116
You would never found me.

11:41.117 --> 11:42.806
That's because

11:42.807 --> 11:44.495
after two minutes,

11:41.117 --> 11:44.495
we stopped seeking.

11:45.747 --> 11:47.333
Wait, so my record

11:47.334 --> 11:48.916
is meaningless?

11:48.917 --> 11:50.231
Go ahead, Ravi,

11:50.232 --> 11:51.543
throw in the towel.

11:51.544 --> 11:53.067
Typical for someone

11:53.068 --> 11:54.588
from your generation.

11:54.589 --> 11:56.049
This is how you guys

11:56.050 --> 11:57.508
ruined the environment.

11:58.384 --> 11:59.907
I am only five years

11:59.908 --> 12:01.428
older than you!

12:01.429 --> 12:02.514
(LOUDLY)

12:02.515 --> 12:03.597
You're shouting again.

12:03.598 --> 12:05.516
- Turn down
- your hearing aid.

12:07.518 --> 12:08.769
Guys, guys...

12:08.770 --> 12:09.896
You've already done

12:09.897 --> 12:11.021
so much work.

12:11.022 --> 12:12.023
You don't want it

12:12.024 --> 12:13.024
to go to waste.

12:13.025 --> 12:14.901
- That would be like
- if Einstein stopped

12:14.904 --> 12:16.819
- When the apple
- hit him on the head.

12:18.613 --> 12:20.489
BOTH: That was Newton.

12:20.490 --> 12:21.866
You mean the cookie guy?

12:28.414 --> 12:29.958
Whoa, Jorge, you

12:29.959 --> 12:31.501
are really focused.

12:32.627 --> 12:33.919
Jorge?

12:33.920 --> 12:35.420
(SNORING)

12:35.421 --> 12:37.631
Ah!

12:37.632 --> 12:38.926
Were you sleeping

12:38.927 --> 12:40.218
with your eyes open?

12:37.632 --> 12:40.217
Yup.

12:40.218 --> 12:41.428
Little trick I picked up

12:41.429 --> 12:42.636
in second grade.

12:42.637 --> 12:43.929
Didn't affect me, though.

12:43.930 --> 12:45.348
I can still name

12:45.349 --> 12:46.766
all 39 states.

12:48.267 --> 12:49.978
Bro, quit hibernating

12:49.979 --> 12:51.687
and keep carving your bear.

12:51.688 --> 12:54.690
You try carving with a spork!

12:54.691 --> 12:55.775
And why isn't

12:55.776 --> 12:56.858
my bear on top?

12:56.859 --> 12:59.446
Look, Jorge, the totem pole

12:59.447 --> 13:02.031
has to go grouse, bobcat,

12:56.859 --> 13:02.030
badger, rabbit,

13:02.031 --> 13:03.573
woodchuck, weasel, grizzly.

13:03.574 --> 13:05.450
It would make no sense

13:05.451 --> 13:07.245
to go grizzly, grouse,

13:07.246 --> 13:09.038
bobcat, badger, rabbit,

13:05.451 --> 13:09.037
woodchuck, weasel!

13:09.038 --> 13:10.456
Or am I crazy?

13:12.417 --> 13:13.418
Kinda.

13:18.047 --> 13:19.464
I ditched Hazel and Lou.

13:19.465 --> 13:20.529
I told them I saw

13:20.530 --> 13:21.591
a ferret with the phone.

13:21.592 --> 13:23.574
I figure we have five minutes

13:23.575 --> 13:25.555
before they realize

13:21.592 --> 13:25.554
that's crazy.

13:25.555 --> 13:27.161
Ravi and Tiffany said

13:27.162 --> 13:28.766
they need 10 to finish

13:25.555 --> 13:28.765
the router.

13:28.766 --> 13:30.289
There's got to be some

13:30.290 --> 13:31.811
in here, since even

13:28.766 --> 13:31.810
the lettuce we eat

13:31.811 --> 13:34.229
comes out of a can.

13:34.230 --> 13:35.753
Okay, I'll boost you up,

13:35.754 --> 13:37.275
and just grab all the tin cans

13:34.230 --> 13:37.274
you can find.

13:37.275 --> 13:38.276
Okay.

13:41.362 --> 13:43.156
- Oh!
- (GASPS)

13:43.159 --> 13:44.929
Wow, I thought

13:44.930 --> 13:46.701
the food smelled bad

13:43.156 --> 13:46.701
before they threw it away.

13:48.953 --> 13:50.455
I just need to get

13:50.456 --> 13:51.956
a little closer...

13:48.953 --> 13:51.955
Okay.

13:51.956 --> 13:53.040
(GASPS)

13:53.041 --> 13:54.542
Ow!

13:56.210 --> 13:58.129
ZURI: Uh, too close.

13:59.047 --> 14:00.255
Hey, Lou.

14:00.256 --> 14:01.548
Hey, Hazel.

14:01.549 --> 14:02.946
How nice to see you coming

14:02.947 --> 14:04.342
right toward me,

14:04.343 --> 14:06.262
beside this dumpster.

14:07.221 --> 14:08.638
Well, we found the ferret.

14:08.639 --> 14:09.704
No phone,

14:09.705 --> 14:10.767
but a lot of fleas.

14:12.977 --> 14:14.812
- Listen, Ross,
- you and your sister

14:14.815 --> 14:16.229
Are the only ones in camp

14:16.230 --> 14:17.856
we haven't searched.

14:17.857 --> 14:19.399
I know you have the phone.

14:19.400 --> 14:20.984
Whoa, whoa.

14:20.985 --> 14:22.070
Emma's on our side,

14:22.071 --> 14:23.153
and if she says she doesn't

14:23.154 --> 14:24.177
have the phone,

14:24.178 --> 14:25.197
she doesn't have it.

14:25.198 --> 14:26.324
We're such good friends,

14:26.325 --> 14:27.449
I'd know if she was lying,

14:27.450 --> 14:28.535
because we finish

14:28.536 --> 14:29.618
each other's...

14:29.619 --> 14:30.620
Laundry?

14:30.621 --> 14:31.621
Close enough.

14:32.872 --> 14:34.790
Okay, okay,

14:34.791 --> 14:35.917
but that phone

14:35.918 --> 14:37.042
has to be somewhere.

14:37.043 --> 14:38.253
I better check Xander

14:38.254 --> 14:39.461
one more time.

14:39.462 --> 14:40.879
Hey, Xander.

14:40.880 --> 14:42.090
You can run

14:42.091 --> 14:43.299
but you can't hide.

14:47.011 --> 14:48.763
- Sorry Hazel
- doesn't trust you.

14:48.766 --> 14:50.431
- She just doesn't know
- how awesome you are,

14:50.434 --> 14:52.183
- That you would never,
- ever lie.

14:52.892 --> 14:54.601
Thanks, Lou.

14:54.602 --> 14:56.895
(CLICKING TONGUE)

14:56.896 --> 14:58.774
I don't know why

14:58.775 --> 15:00.650
I get the extra-large.

14:56.896 --> 15:00.649
I can never finish it.

15:00.650 --> 15:02.235
(LIQUID SPLASHING)

15:09.242 --> 15:11.391
The irony is,

15:11.392 --> 15:13.538
that smoothie got everywhere

15:09.242 --> 15:13.538
but in my mouth.

15:16.749 --> 15:18.500
Hey, are you okay?

15:18.501 --> 15:20.085
Not really.

15:20.086 --> 15:21.421
I don't know what's dirtier,

15:21.422 --> 15:22.755
your clothes or my conscience.

15:28.261 --> 15:30.512
Bonjour, mon ami!

15:30.513 --> 15:32.077
Jorge, the French Immersion

15:32.078 --> 15:33.641
Camp is across the lake.

15:34.559 --> 15:36.685
I am an artiste.

15:36.686 --> 15:38.167
And I am going to paint

15:38.168 --> 15:39.647
my section of the totem pole

15:36.686 --> 15:39.646
bright orange.

15:39.647 --> 15:41.211
No! This is a totem pole,

15:41.212 --> 15:42.774
not a giant traffic cone.

15:42.775 --> 15:44.715
You know, everyone says

15:44.716 --> 15:46.654
you're the coolest counselor

15:42.775 --> 15:46.653
at camp...

15:46.654 --> 15:48.530
Well, I don't know about that.

15:48.531 --> 15:49.866
Gabe from canoe class

15:49.867 --> 15:51.200
once met Jay-Z's cousin.

15:51.784 --> 15:53.493
But now,

15:53.494 --> 15:54.809
you've turned into a big

15:54.810 --> 15:56.122
control freak who's no fun.

15:57.623 --> 15:59.144
- You guys can paint this
- without me.

15:59.792 --> 16:02.002
I'm keeping the 'stache.

16:02.003 --> 16:04.130
Word in trampoline class

16:04.131 --> 16:06.257
is that Katie likes

16:02.003 --> 16:06.257
a guy with facial hair.

16:06.924 --> 16:08.342
Ooh-la-la!

16:14.849 --> 16:16.435
So, did you guys hide

16:16.436 --> 16:18.019
the router in the top

16:14.849 --> 16:18.018
of the totem pole?

16:18.019 --> 16:19.625
Yes. And thanks

16:19.626 --> 16:21.229
to my brilliant engineering,

16:21.230 --> 16:22.315
we hid the wires

16:22.316 --> 16:23.398
in the badger tail.

16:23.399 --> 16:25.152
It's sealed up tighter

16:25.153 --> 16:26.903
than your brother's mind

16:23.399 --> 16:26.902
to new ideas.

16:26.903 --> 16:28.028
(ZURI LAUGHS)

16:28.029 --> 16:29.404
Good one, Tiffany.

16:29.405 --> 16:31.282
- Now let's power
- this baby up.

16:32.200 --> 16:33.826
For Gladys.

16:35.786 --> 16:37.622
- (BEEPS)
- (GASPS)

16:37.625 --> 16:39.186
Oh, check it out, Emma.

16:39.187 --> 16:40.749
My router is working.

16:40.750 --> 16:42.751
Actually, it's my router.

16:42.752 --> 16:44.566
You spent most of the time

16:44.567 --> 16:46.380
rubbing wrinkle cream

16:42.752 --> 16:46.379
on your face.

16:46.380 --> 16:48.466
It was aloe for my dry skin,

16:48.467 --> 16:50.551
which affects people

16:46.380 --> 16:50.551
of all ages.

16:53.513 --> 16:55.847
Look! The phone is working.

16:55.848 --> 16:57.747
Nerds are not just

16:57.748 --> 16:59.643
for doing homework anymore.

16:59.644 --> 17:01.125
I don't care.

17:01.126 --> 17:02.604
I feel terrible.

17:02.605 --> 17:04.232
- I never should have
- lied to Lou.

17:04.234 --> 17:06.150
Lied about what?

17:07.193 --> 17:08.194
Emma?

17:09.487 --> 17:11.238
So you had the phone.

17:11.239 --> 17:12.469
Lou, I can explain...

17:12.470 --> 17:13.698
Explain what?

17:13.699 --> 17:15.535
That you lied to me, because

17:15.536 --> 17:17.369
your phone is more important

17:13.699 --> 17:17.368
to you than our friendship?

17:17.369 --> 17:18.994
That's not true.

17:18.996 --> 17:20.498
Technically, this is

17:20.499 --> 17:21.998
not my phone.

17:21.999 --> 17:23.542
You know, as a CIT,

17:23.544 --> 17:25.086
you're supposed to set

17:21.999 --> 17:25.085
a good example.

17:25.086 --> 17:26.503
You're not going to

17:26.505 --> 17:27.921
tell on us, are you?

17:27.922 --> 17:29.714
Nope,

17:29.715 --> 17:31.217
because I would

17:31.218 --> 17:32.718
never betray my friend

17:29.715 --> 17:32.717
and fellow Woodchucks.

17:32.718 --> 17:34.679
(CLICKING TONGUE)

17:36.097 --> 17:37.098
Lou!

17:39.392 --> 17:41.393
Hey, Murray, my man!

17:41.394 --> 17:42.834
Overnight me a number

17:42.835 --> 17:44.272
seven with extra slaw.

17:46.107 --> 17:48.608
Address? I don't know.

17:48.609 --> 17:50.319
Head for Maine, and look

17:50.320 --> 17:52.029
for a cute girl in the woods

17:48.609 --> 17:52.029
jonesing for pastrami.

18:00.871 --> 18:02.038
Jorge,

18:02.039 --> 18:03.373
I want to talk to you.

18:03.374 --> 18:05.293
- Well, I don't want
- to talk to you.

18:05.296 --> 18:06.711
I'd storm out if I weren't

18:06.712 --> 18:08.129
so darn comfy.

18:10.673 --> 18:12.799
Look...

18:12.800 --> 18:14.699
I want to apologize

18:14.700 --> 18:16.596
for being such

18:12.800 --> 18:16.595
a totem pole tyrant.

18:16.596 --> 18:17.764
I forgot this was

18:17.765 --> 18:18.930
your project, too.

18:18.931 --> 18:20.348
I'm really sorry, bro.

18:20.349 --> 18:21.725
That's okay.

18:21.726 --> 18:23.020
I know how much

18:23.021 --> 18:24.311
this means to you.

18:24.312 --> 18:26.147
I saw how hard

18:26.148 --> 18:27.981
you hugged that tree.

18:27.982 --> 18:29.505
Yeah, I'm still pulling bark

18:29.506 --> 18:31.026
out of my belly button.

18:31.027 --> 18:32.987
- (LAUGHING)
- Look,

18:32.990 --> 18:34.405
How about you paint

18:34.406 --> 18:35.823
your section so bright

18:32.987 --> 18:35.822
they can see it from space?

18:35.823 --> 18:36.824
Huh?

18:38.159 --> 18:40.869
Merci, Xandee.

18:40.870 --> 18:42.537
De nada, Jorge.

18:42.538 --> 18:43.830
Now, come on.

18:43.831 --> 18:45.749
Hang on.

18:45.750 --> 18:47.961
Since you apologized,

18:47.962 --> 18:50.171
it seems rude to leave

18:45.750 --> 18:50.171
that snake in your bed.

18:51.714 --> 18:52.881
(HISSING)

18:52.882 --> 18:53.924
Whoa!

18:55.843 --> 18:57.095
Well, it could be worse.

18:57.096 --> 18:58.346
Could be Hazel under there.

19:02.433 --> 19:03.434
Hey, Lou.

19:04.769 --> 19:05.874
I got you a slice

19:05.875 --> 19:06.978
of apple pie.

19:06.979 --> 19:08.148
They were running out

19:08.149 --> 19:09.315
and I know

19:06.979 --> 19:09.314
how much you love it.

19:09.315 --> 19:10.671
How do I know

19:10.672 --> 19:12.025
that's really apple pie?

19:12.026 --> 19:13.841
Because it's got these

19:13.842 --> 19:15.655
little pieces of apple

19:12.026 --> 19:15.655
surrounded by pie crust?

19:16.322 --> 19:18.239
So you say.

19:18.240 --> 19:19.555
You've been lying to me

19:19.556 --> 19:20.868
so much lately,

19:18.240 --> 19:20.867
I don't know what to think.

19:20.868 --> 19:21.932
I even believed a ferret

19:21.933 --> 19:22.994
could steal a phone.

19:22.995 --> 19:24.747
- That's how much
- I trusted you.

19:25.790 --> 19:27.165
Lou, I feel terrible.

19:27.166 --> 19:28.834
- Please tell me what I can do
- to make it up to you.

19:28.837 --> 19:30.293
Nothing.

19:30.294 --> 19:31.921
Lou, please...

19:35.424 --> 19:36.696
I knew you'd give me

19:36.697 --> 19:37.968
another chance.

19:35.424 --> 19:37.967
No.

19:37.968 --> 19:39.512
I just want the pie.

19:43.933 --> 19:45.998
Welcome, everyone,

19:45.999 --> 19:48.062
to Camp Kikiwaka's

19:43.933 --> 19:48.061
totem pole unveiling.

19:48.062 --> 19:49.251
(APPLAUDING)

19:49.252 --> 19:50.439
(CHEERING)

19:54.944 --> 19:56.508
I want to thank all

19:56.509 --> 19:58.072
the campers who

19:54.944 --> 19:58.071
helped make this possible,

19:58.072 --> 19:59.406
especially Jorge,

19:59.407 --> 20:00.700
who taught me everyone's

20:00.701 --> 20:01.991
vision has value.

20:01.992 --> 20:03.140
And if you value

20:03.141 --> 20:04.285
your vision,

20:04.286 --> 20:05.726
don't stare at his section

20:05.727 --> 20:07.164
too long.

20:13.379 --> 20:15.505
Hello, Murray?

20:15.506 --> 20:17.882
I'm still waiting.

20:17.883 --> 20:19.156
What do you mean your

20:19.157 --> 20:20.427
delivery guy got lost?

20:20.428 --> 20:21.576
I've got a

20:21.577 --> 20:22.721
kugel craving!

20:22.722 --> 20:23.848
(VEHICLE APPROACHING)

20:25.307 --> 20:27.600
(ALL SCREAMING)

20:27.601 --> 20:29.270
Emma, what in the Waka

20:29.271 --> 20:30.937
are you doing?

20:30.938 --> 20:31.939
I'm trying to show you

20:31.940 --> 20:32.940
that your friendship

20:30.938 --> 20:32.939
is more important

20:32.940 --> 20:34.566
than a stupid cell phone!

20:34.567 --> 20:36.807
- Now get out of the way,
- I don't want to run you over!

20:37.445 --> 20:38.863
(METAL CLANGS)

20:45.786 --> 20:47.078
(EVERYONE SCREAMING)

20:47.079 --> 20:48.956
No! Our totem pole!

20:54.336 --> 20:56.777
Wow, Gladys is going

20:56.778 --> 20:59.216
to be really upset that

20:54.336 --> 20:59.215
Emma ran over her router.

20:59.216 --> 21:01.115
She might also be a tad miffed

21:01.116 --> 21:03.011
that Emma broke the flagpole

21:03.012 --> 21:04.076
and almost burned down

21:04.077 --> 21:05.138
the camp.

21:05.139 --> 21:07.056
Guys, wise up!

21:07.057 --> 21:08.247
This router was never

21:08.248 --> 21:09.434
for Gladys.

21:09.435 --> 21:11.104
Emma and I just tricked you

21:11.105 --> 21:12.772
so we could get phone service.

21:14.315 --> 21:16.004
Emma has a very serious

21:16.005 --> 21:17.693
lying problem.

21:19.069 --> 21:20.488
Our totem pole is now

21:20.489 --> 21:21.905
a totem stub.

21:21.906 --> 21:23.281
Don't be sad, buddy.

21:23.282 --> 21:24.388
At least the good part

21:24.389 --> 21:25.493
is still here.

21:26.994 --> 21:29.078
Sorry, guys,

21:29.079 --> 21:30.790
but I needed to do something

21:30.791 --> 21:32.500
huge to show Lou how important

21:29.079 --> 21:32.499
she is to me.

21:32.500 --> 21:34.293
- You could have just given
- the phone back.

21:34.296 --> 21:35.503
Or pulled the plug

21:35.504 --> 21:36.711
on the tower.

21:36.712 --> 21:39.507
Hindsight is 20/20, people.

21:40.090 --> 21:41.591
Lou,

21:41.592 --> 21:43.802
I am really sorry.

21:43.803 --> 21:45.388
I was so worried about my

21:45.389 --> 21:46.971
stupid online followers,

21:46.972 --> 21:47.995
that I lost

21:47.996 --> 21:49.016
my real best friend.

21:49.767 --> 21:50.851
Please forgive me.

21:52.603 --> 21:54.104
Of course.

21:55.564 --> 21:57.106
And hey, I get it.

21:57.107 --> 21:58.359
I've got 150,000

21:58.360 --> 21:59.609
followers myself.

21:59.610 --> 22:00.779
You do?

22:00.780 --> 22:01.945
Yep. On Farmpage.

22:01.946 --> 22:03.156
There are a ton

22:03.157 --> 22:04.365
of tech savvy pigs

22:01.946 --> 22:04.365
out there.

22:09.203 --> 22:10.600
I can't believe that stupid

22:10.601 --> 22:11.996
deli guy never showed up.

22:11.997 --> 22:13.249
Yeah, surprising, considering

22:13.250 --> 22:14.499
that exact address

22:14.500 --> 22:16.418
- you gave him.
- "Cute girl in the woods."

22:18.838 --> 22:20.235
(GASPS) Hey!

22:20.236 --> 22:21.631
My deli platter!

22:21.632 --> 22:24.133
This pastrami is delectable.

22:24.134 --> 22:25.552
So is the corned beef.

22:25.553 --> 22:26.992
This white stuff is

22:26.993 --> 22:28.429
really good, too.

22:28.430 --> 22:30.723
It's kinda lemony.

22:30.724 --> 22:31.872
Those are

22:31.873 --> 22:33.018
the moist towelettes.
