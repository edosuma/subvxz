sometimes it's easier this way.

14:50.523 --> 14:52.787
Oh, yeah, that was a breeze.

15:04.203 --> 15:06.570
Speak to me, Mel.

15:10.343 --> 15:12.175
I need you.

15:14.647 --> 15:16.672
I need somebody.

15:22.488 --> 15:26.049
Excuse me, I need somebody.
I got this two Iunatics chasing me--

15:27.193 --> 15:28.388
Hello?

15:28.561 --> 15:29.960
Hello?

15:30.930 --> 15:33.490
Everybody here is nuts.

15:34.700 --> 15:36.464
Yes?

15:37.737 --> 15:40.866
Excuse me,
I didn't think you heard me, I--

15:42.108 --> 15:43.735
Never mind.

15:44.911 --> 15:47.039
I said, yes?

15:48.080 --> 15:51.710
Oh, for Pete's sake, some people.

15:52.084 --> 15:54.519
If you need something,
why don't you just...?

15:54.687 --> 15:56.177
[PHONE RINGING]

15:56.355 --> 15:58.153
Coming.

16:01.327 --> 16:03.591
- Yeah?
- Your Honor, Leon's gone.

16:03.763 --> 16:06.289
- Call me back.
- He ran from Mrs. Lund and that couple.

16:06.466 --> 16:08.366
I knew that was gonna happen.

16:08.534 --> 16:09.831
Come on.

16:10.002 --> 16:11.060
Excuse me, I didn't mean--

16:14.707 --> 16:16.232
Hello?

16:16.409 --> 16:17.968
- Mel.
- That way.

16:18.144 --> 16:19.805
Right.

16:22.114 --> 16:24.515
Look, you're gonna have to
call him back.

[SIGHS]

16:31.023 --> 16:32.491
Huh.

16:40.466 --> 16:43.925
Don't ever change.

16:45.204 --> 16:47.070
I mean it.

16:52.345 --> 16:54.677
- Any sign of Harry?
- Not yet.

16:55.414 --> 16:58.714
Mac, I'm so worried.
Nobody's heard from him since yesterday.

16:58.885 --> 17:02.412
As long as that kid's missing,
Harry will search for him till he drops.

17:10.229 --> 17:13.221
Found him outside on the steps.
He almost made it to the door.

17:14.233 --> 17:17.601
- How long you think he was laying there?
- I don't know.

17:17.770 --> 17:20.296
But these footprints look fresh.

17:34.287 --> 17:35.777
You may be seated.

17:40.826 --> 17:44.785
- Sir.
- Ugly-Iooking bunch, huh, Mac?

17:44.964 --> 17:48.696
- Sir, I canceled the session.
- Oh.

17:48.868 --> 17:52.099
Sir, why don't you go back in your office,
get a little more sleep?

17:52.271 --> 17:55.935
- The police will call if they find him.
- I can't sleep, Mac.

17:56.108 --> 18:00.306
I keep having this dream of people
walking all over me.

18:04.016 --> 18:06.041
Wanna talk about it?

18:08.554 --> 18:09.851
No.

18:13.526 --> 18:15.426
Take it easy, sir.

18:22.735 --> 18:23.998
Come on.

18:24.170 --> 18:26.662
Step over me.

18:28.140 --> 18:30.108
Come on.

18:32.612 --> 18:34.205
LEON:
Hi, Harry.

18:37.583 --> 18:39.608
You look like raw sewage.

18:41.354 --> 18:42.515
Leon.

18:42.955 --> 18:46.858
Don't come any closer.
If you do, I'll take off again.

18:47.593 --> 18:48.788
Where you been, Leon?

18:49.662 --> 18:51.323
Here and there.

18:51.797 --> 18:53.731
You don't have to worry about me.

18:54.200 --> 18:56.225
I do worry about you, Leon.

18:56.402 --> 18:58.370
You know I worry about you.

18:58.804 --> 19:00.670
Yeah, I know.

19:01.507 --> 19:04.909
I heard through the grapevine
you were looking for me last night.

19:05.077 --> 19:08.911
What are you, crazy.
walking around these streets by yourself?

19:10.650 --> 19:14.109
Why don't you come on in, huh?
We'll have a bite. Maybe we could talk.

19:15.388 --> 19:16.822
Don't come any closer.

19:16.989 --> 19:20.220
You know once I get out this door,
you'll never be able to catch me.

19:20.860 --> 19:22.089
Yeah, I know.

19:25.398 --> 19:27.423
I just came by to tell you...

19:30.069 --> 19:34.165
To tell you thanks
for letting me crash with you for a while...

19:34.707 --> 19:37.267
...and not to get discouraged
because there's nothing...

19:37.443 --> 19:39.741
...you people can do
with somebody like me.

19:39.912 --> 19:41.778
You're wrong, Leon.

19:41.947 --> 19:43.915
There is stuff we can do for you.

19:44.083 --> 19:46.848
- Like?
- Like we got you parents, right?

19:47.019 --> 19:49.317
A bat and a puck?

19:52.324 --> 19:54.759
Okay, so they're geeks.

19:56.896 --> 19:59.558
But they're nice geeks.

19:59.732 --> 20:02.724
Maybe with a little care,
a little understanding from you...

20:02.902 --> 20:05.428
...they would have turned out fine.

20:05.604 --> 20:08.005
They wanted to try, Leon.

20:08.174 --> 20:10.199
You never gave them a chance.

20:11.077 --> 20:14.069
I guess that's why
they call me inconugated.

20:15.281 --> 20:16.680
Incorrigible.

20:16.849 --> 20:18.817
- That's the word.
- Yeah.

20:19.385 --> 20:21.717
I don't think you're incorrigible, Leon.

20:22.154 --> 20:23.417
Harry.

20:23.589 --> 20:27.651
- You got a lot to learn. I gotta go.
- Where are you gonna go?

20:29.295 --> 20:30.956
California.

20:31.130 --> 20:32.894

20:33.065 --> 20:35.159
Maybe I can get a series.

20:36.368 --> 20:39.998
Gary Coleman must be getting pretty close
to retirement by now.

20:40.172 --> 20:41.936
Don't go.

20:42.408 --> 20:44.172
We will work something out.

20:44.343 --> 20:45.811
There's nothing to work out.

20:45.978 --> 20:49.676
Yeah, there is something to work out.
It's what you want and you know it.

20:49.849 --> 20:51.715
- Says who?
- Says me.

20:51.884 --> 20:55.115
You came back, right?
So you must have had a reason.

20:55.287 --> 20:57.255
Yeah, I had a reason.

21:00.993 --> 21:02.825
But it's stupid.

21:05.064 --> 21:06.327
Tell me.

21:06.832 --> 21:08.425
I thought...

21:10.102 --> 21:13.402
I thought
maybe I could keep staying with you.

21:15.508 --> 21:16.532
Leon.

21:16.709 --> 21:18.700
- Told you it was stupid.
- It's not stupid.

21:19.478 --> 21:21.879
- Isn't it?
- No.

21:26.352 --> 21:28.116
But it's not...

21:28.988 --> 21:31.923
It's not what's best for you.

21:32.091 --> 21:35.823
What's best for you is a family
that's got a father and a mother...

21:35.995 --> 21:38.089
...and that's something
I can't offer to you.

21:38.264 --> 21:41.529
And I don't know
if I'll ever be able to offer you that.

21:42.268 --> 21:44.362
But I did hope...

21:46.972 --> 21:49.339
...that we'd always befriends.

21:51.811 --> 21:54.872
I wish you could have
always been my father.

21:57.316 --> 21:59.546

21:59.718 --> 22:01.652
Leon!
