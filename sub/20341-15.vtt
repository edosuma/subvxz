Ah, I've been looking forward
to this trip all month.

01:10.208 --> 01:14.458
(chuckles)
Finally a chance to use
my favorite fishing pole,

01:14.458 --> 01:16.833
enjoying a day
with my favorite pups

01:16.833 --> 01:18.375
in the great outdoors.

01:18.375 --> 01:19.958
It is pretty great.

01:19.958 --> 01:21.208
And we're outdoors.

01:21.208 --> 01:22.208
Oh, is that a fish?

01:23.833 --> 01:25.375
Where?
I don't see it.

01:25.375 --> 01:27.250
(fishing reel whirring)

01:27.250 --> 01:28.833
Whoa, oh!

01:30.000 --> 01:31.083
Whoa!

01:31.083 --> 01:32.625
Rolly:
It's a flying fishing pole!

01:35.583 --> 01:37.875
I'm gonna guess that
that wasn't supposed to happen.

01:37.875 --> 01:40.500
Uh, that wasn't
supposed to happen.

01:40.500 --> 01:44.708
Ugh, something just swam off
with my favorite fishing pole.

01:44.708 --> 01:46.625
I'll never get that back.

01:46.625 --> 01:50.458
Well, without my fishing pole,
there's no fishing trip.

01:50.458 --> 01:52.750
We may as well
just head back home.

01:54.875 --> 01:56.000
(Bob sighs)

01:56.000 --> 01:58.625
Okay, before we hit the road
to go back home,

01:58.625 --> 02:00.250
we'll just pop inside this shop

02:00.250 --> 02:02.416
and pick out
some delicious snacks.

02:04.583 --> 02:07.958
Well, looks like you boys
need to wait out here.

02:07.958 --> 02:09.750
But don't worry,

02:09.750 --> 02:13.500
there's a window
so I can keep an eye on you
from inside the store.

02:13.500 --> 02:15.750
The great outdoors
suddenly isn't so great

02:15.750 --> 02:18.416
when Bob's so sad
that his trip got ruined.

02:18.416 --> 02:20.625
Well, then,
guess what time it is.

02:20.625 --> 02:22.708
I don't know.
Maybe noon-ish?

02:22.708 --> 02:25.125
It's time to get
Bob's fishing pole.

02:25.125 --> 02:26.458
(exerting)

02:26.458 --> 02:28.375
Now where do we start?

02:30.000 --> 02:31.750
A big fish, you say?

02:31.750 --> 02:34.083
Oh, it wasn't a fish.

02:34.083 --> 02:36.416
Have I got a tale for you!

02:36.416 --> 02:40.166
(inhales deeply)
A long time ago

02:40.166 --> 02:43.625
in a part of the lake
far, far away...

02:43.625 --> 02:46.458
How are we
going to get on the lake

02:46.458 --> 02:48.250
to find out what took
Bob's fishing pole?

02:48.250 --> 02:52.500
I know what swam off
with your Bob's fishing pole.

02:52.500 --> 02:54.583
Well, hello there,
Mr... Dog.

02:54.583 --> 02:57.333
Quinty McSquinty is the name.

02:57.333 --> 02:58.416
Tell me,

02:58.416 --> 03:01.958
have you pups
ever heard of
Ol' Snapper?

03:01.958 --> 03:04.875
Have we ever heard
of Ol' Snapper, ha!

03:04.875 --> 03:07.333
Bingo, have we ever heard
of Ol' Snapper?

03:07.333 --> 03:09.708
-No.
-No, Mr. McSquinty,
we have not.

03:09.708 --> 03:10.958
What's Ol' Snapper?

03:10.958 --> 03:13.458
You mean "who" is Ol' Snapper.

03:13.458 --> 03:15.708
Well, Ol' Snapper is a monster

03:15.708 --> 03:18.250
that roams deep beneath
these waters.

03:19.375 --> 03:21.750
The legend says
that Ol' Snapper

03:21.750 --> 03:25.000
was born from the muck and mud
at the bottom of the lake.

03:25.000 --> 03:29.875
He'll take whatever
he finds in the lake
to his hideout forever.

03:29.875 --> 03:31.333
(both gasp)

03:33.708 --> 03:36.583
Well, Mr. McSquinty,
my brother and I need to

03:36.583 --> 03:39.500
head into those waters
to get Bob's fishing pole.

03:39.500 --> 03:42.458
There's an island
in the center of this lake,

03:42.458 --> 03:43.875
Snapper Island,

03:43.875 --> 03:47.500
a mound of stones covered
in gooey green glop.

03:47.500 --> 03:51.416
That's where it's rumored
Ol' Snapper's hideout is.

03:51.416 --> 03:54.708
Most likely,
that's where you'll find
Bob's fishing pole.

03:54.708 --> 03:56.958
Thanks, Quinty.
You're a huge help.

03:56.958 --> 03:58.583
Wait a minute there.

03:58.583 --> 04:01.458
For two little pups like you
to make it all the way
to the island,

04:01.458 --> 04:02.958
you're gonna need a boat.

04:06.875 --> 04:08.166
Like that one?

04:08.166 --> 04:11.208
You're gonna need
a bigger boat.

04:12.458 --> 04:13.875
Okay, Rolly,

04:13.875 --> 04:16.625
our mission is to find
a boat that's just right for us

04:16.625 --> 04:19.875
and take it to Snapper Island
and get Bob's fishing pole back.

04:19.875 --> 04:21.125
Come on, Rolly.

04:21.125 --> 04:22.583
Thanks, Quinty McSquinty.

04:22.583 --> 04:24.250
Good luck, pups.

04:24.250 --> 04:26.208
You're gonna need it.

04:27.333 --> 04:29.250
(barking in rhythm)

your fishing pole.

07:28.583 --> 07:30.958
Now we just need to find
Bob's fishing pole.

07:30.958 --> 07:32.333
Do you remember
what it looks like?

07:32.333 --> 07:34.250
Only that it was
shiny and red

07:34.250 --> 07:36.416
and looked exactly
like that one.

07:36.416 --> 07:39.083

there is is!

07:39.083 --> 07:41.000

07:41.000 --> 07:44.000
Let's head back to shore
so that we can give this to Bob.

07:47.208 --> 07:49.750
We better start paddling
if we want to
make it there soon.

07:49.750 --> 07:52.000
I can get us there
faster with...

07:52.000 --> 07:54.750
Rolly power to the rescue.

07:54.750 --> 07:57.625
Bob's gonna be
so happy when he gets
his fishing pole back.

07:57.625 --> 08:01.250
I bet he'll smile smilier
than he's ever smiled before.

08:01.250 --> 08:02.500
That's pretty smiley.

08:03.750 --> 08:05.750
-Whoa!
-Whoa!

08:05.750 --> 08:07.000
Bingo!

08:11.583 --> 08:13.083
Bow to the ow!

08:13.083 --> 08:14.625
What happened?

08:14.625 --> 08:16.208
Rolly, you okay?

08:16.208 --> 08:17.416
All good.

08:18.583 --> 08:21.083
Uh-oh.
Swim, Rolly, swim!

08:26.833 --> 08:28.750
(panting)

08:31.958 --> 08:33.583
Huh?

08:33.583 --> 08:34.750
(exclaims)

08:37.125 --> 08:38.750
Whoa!

08:38.750 --> 08:39.875
Bingo!

08:39.875 --> 08:41.333
(gasps)

08:46.125 --> 08:47.750
It's got to be Ol' Snapper.

08:47.750 --> 08:50.000
He's come back
for Bob's fishing pole.

08:54.083 --> 08:55.875
Bingo, come back!

08:58.416 --> 09:02.000
Wow. Ol' Snapper is fast,
and I'm getting tired.

09:02.000 --> 09:03.250
Bingo!

09:08.500 --> 09:09.750
Bingo!

09:16.708 --> 09:18.875
I'm coming to you, Rolly.

♪ Ol' Snapper ♪

09:22.833 --> 09:25.333
You, you came back for me.

I'll always come back
for you, Rolly.
You're my brother.

09:27.708 --> 09:29.166
But Bob's fishing pole...

09:29.166 --> 09:30.958
It's gone.

09:30.958 --> 09:32.333
No, it's not!

09:32.333 --> 09:34.583
Look, we just need to follow
the bubble trail.

09:34.583 --> 09:36.000
What do you say, Rolly?

09:36.000 --> 09:37.708
You think you can
swim some more?

09:37.708 --> 09:38.833
For Bob?

09:38.833 --> 09:40.708
For Bob, I can do anything.

09:43.625 --> 09:45.708
I miss our boat.

09:45.708 --> 09:48.208
Should've figured
Ol' Snapper would
come back here.

09:48.208 --> 09:50.875
Now where's Bob's fishing pole?

09:52.291 --> 09:54.416
It's not here.
Where could it be?

09:55.416 --> 09:57.500
(low growling)

09:57.500 --> 09:58.875
Uh, Bingo,

09:58.875 --> 10:01.125
is that you breathing down
the back of my neck?

10:01.125 --> 10:03.875
Uh, I was gonna ask you
the same thing.

10:06.833 --> 10:08.583
(screaming)

10:08.583 --> 10:09.833
(screams)

10:11.833 --> 10:13.708
(all screaming)

10:13.708 --> 10:14.958
Wait.

10:14.958 --> 10:17.583
I know why we're screaming,

10:17.583 --> 10:18.750
but why are you screaming?

10:18.750 --> 10:22.708
Because you guys nearly
scared me out of my shell.

10:22.708 --> 10:24.458
We scared you?

10:24.458 --> 10:26.208
We're cute puppies.

10:26.208 --> 10:28.833
You're a scary creature
born from the mud
and muck of the lake.

10:31.208 --> 10:33.000
Yikes!

10:33.000 --> 10:33.875
Sorry about that.

10:33.875 --> 10:35.458
(vocalizing)

10:35.458 --> 10:36.708
Oh, that's better.

10:36.708 --> 10:38.333
Guess I do look pretty scary

10:38.333 --> 10:41.708
with all this gunk
that gets all over me
when I swim.

10:41.708 --> 10:43.500
Allow me
to introduce myself.

10:43.500 --> 10:44.750
I'm Ol' Snapper.

10:44.750 --> 10:47.083
I'm Bingo.
This is my brother Rolly.

10:47.083 --> 10:49.458
We're out here to get
Bob's favorite fishing pole back

10:49.458 --> 10:50.875
so we can go fishing again.

10:50.875 --> 10:53.083
Ooh, you mean
the shiny red stick

10:53.083 --> 10:55.000
someone left in my lake
as a gift?

10:55.000 --> 10:56.375
Gift?

10:56.375 --> 10:59.500
People seem to leave me gifts
in my lake all the time.

10:59.500 --> 11:03.458
Today I got a bobby thing
that also had this nifty stick
attached to it.

11:03.458 --> 11:04.875
Those aren't gifts.

11:04.875 --> 11:06.291
They belong to our owner Bob.

11:06.291 --> 11:09.000
He dropped the fishing pole
in the water when you
took the bobby thing.

11:09.000 --> 11:11.583
Oh, that's terrible.

11:11.583 --> 11:14.208
Here, take 'em
both back, please.

11:14.208 --> 11:16.166
Thanks. Bob's gonna
be so happy.

11:16.166 --> 11:17.833
We better paddle back to shore.

11:17.833 --> 11:19.333
No, no, no.

11:19.333 --> 11:21.000
You pups do look exhausted.

11:21.000 --> 11:23.708
Plus, I'm pretty fast
for a turtle.

11:23.708 --> 11:25.000
Come on, hop on.

11:26.000 --> 11:28.958
Bow to the wow, wow-wee!

11:30.500 --> 11:32.416
Hey, puppy pals.

11:32.416 --> 11:36.416
(barking)

11:36.416 --> 11:37.875
Wait a minute.

11:37.875 --> 11:39.875
My fishing pole
and my bobber.

11:39.875 --> 11:41.583
We found them, Bob.

11:41.583 --> 11:44.000
Yeah, Bingo and I went out
on the lake in a boat and...

11:44.000 --> 11:47.250
They must've washed up
on the shore when I was inside.

11:51.000 --> 11:53.583
Ah, this is the life.

11:53.583 --> 11:55.458
We did it again, Bingo.

11:55.458 --> 11:57.583
Another mission accomplished.

11:57.583 --> 12:00.875
Say, have you boys ever heard
the legend of Ol' Snapper?

12:00.875 --> 12:03.208
-He's not just a legend.
-He's a turtle!

12:03.208 --> 12:05.375
They say he's 50-feet tall

12:05.375 --> 12:07.000
and lives in
a big castle of mud

12:07.000 --> 12:08.458
on an island in the middle
of the lake.

12:11.000 --> 12:12.958
His name is Ol' Snapper.

12:12.958 --> 12:14.625
♪ Ol' Snapper ♪

12:17.000 --> 12:18.875
(Bingo speaking)

12:20.708 --> 12:22.958
Morning, sleepy snouts.

12:22.958 --> 12:24.083
(snoring)

12:24.083 --> 12:26.458
Hey, there.
Come on, time to wake up.

12:28.208 --> 12:30.333
Rolly, it's morning!

12:30.333 --> 12:32.000
-Hi, Bob.
-Good morning.

12:32.000 --> 12:33.416
Guess what, guys?

12:33.416 --> 12:35.875
My friend just got
a new puppy named Baby.

12:35.875 --> 12:39.125
(laughs)
A puppy named Baby?

12:39.125 --> 12:41.500
(laughs)
That's funny.

12:41.500 --> 12:44.125
She doesn't want the puppy
to get lonely
while she's at work,

12:44.125 --> 12:46.875
so I said Baby can
stay here with you today

12:46.875 --> 12:48.708
and you can keep her company.

12:48.708 --> 12:50.166
Wait, what now?

12:50.166 --> 12:53.000
I told her that you two
are so much fun,

12:53.000 --> 12:55.625
you'll be like
the greatest puppy-sitters ever.

12:55.625 --> 12:56.958
-Yeah.
-We'll take care of...

12:56.958 --> 12:58.291
(barking)

12:58.291 --> 13:00.583
I'm gonna go get Baby
and bring her back here.

13:00.583 --> 13:02.583
See you in a jiffy.

13:02.583 --> 13:05.250
There are going to be
three puppies here?

13:05.250 --> 13:07.875
I'm never going to get
my naps in today.

13:07.875 --> 13:09.125
You hear that, Rolly?

13:09.125 --> 13:11.875
Bob wants us to be
the greatest puppy-sitters ever!

13:11.875 --> 13:14.083
Just like when Bob's mom
puppy-sits us.

13:14.083 --> 13:15.625
Bob's mom is pretty great.

13:15.625 --> 13:16.875
Just like Bob.

13:16.875 --> 13:19.083
And that sounds like
a pretty great mission to me.

13:19.083 --> 13:21.458
That's 'cause it is.
Let's get ready.

13:21.458 --> 13:25.291
Great puppy-sitters
like Bob's mom
get food for the puppies.

13:25.291 --> 13:27.291
So let's give Baby
her own dish.

13:27.291 --> 13:29.000
You know, to help her
feel at home.

13:29.000 --> 13:31.208
Yeah.
Most puppies are small,

13:31.208 --> 13:33.708
so Baby will need
a small bowl.

13:36.875 --> 13:38.500
If we each share
a few of our kibbles,

13:38.500 --> 13:39.708
that'll fill it up.

13:44.958 --> 13:47.000
Bow and wow!

13:47.000 --> 13:48.500
What else do
great puppy-sitters do?

13:48.500 --> 13:51.083
They're good at making sure
puppies get naps.

13:51.083 --> 13:53.208
We need to find a spot
for Baby's nap time.

13:53.208 --> 13:55.375
Baby could sleep in
one of Bob's shoes.

13:55.375 --> 13:57.083
That's what you two
goofballs used to do.

13:57.083 --> 14:00.375
Oh, yeah.
When I was little,
I loved sleeping in Loafy,

14:00.375 --> 14:01.625
Bob's old loafer shoe.

14:01.625 --> 14:05.000
It was the comfiest, coziest
place to take a nap ever!

14:05.000 --> 14:06.583
Until I got too big for it.

14:06.583 --> 14:09.250
Let's find a comfy cozy
sleeping shoe for Baby.

14:12.000 --> 14:14.166
Loafy, my old sleeping shoe!

14:16.458 --> 14:18.166
And I still fit.

14:18.166 --> 14:19.750
(straining)
Sort of.

14:19.750 --> 14:20.833
Not really.

14:20.833 --> 14:22.708
Baby's going to love
sleeping in there.

14:25.458 --> 14:28.125
Baby is gonna
love Loafy.
What's next?

14:28.125 --> 14:31.083
Great puppy-sitters
also have toys
for the puppies to play with.

14:31.083 --> 14:34.125
Hmm, what kind of toys
do little puppies like?

14:34.125 --> 14:36.416
Okay, first of all,
you're still puppies.

14:36.416 --> 14:38.458
We mean when we were
littler puppies,

14:38.458 --> 14:41.208
and we get little bit
less littler every day.

14:41.208 --> 14:43.125
Well, you loved
that squeaky toy.

14:43.125 --> 14:45.708
I used to throw it for you
to fetch when I was bored.

14:45.708 --> 14:47.208
You mean Mr. Mousey?

14:47.208 --> 14:49.083
I haven't seen that
squeaky toy in forever.

14:50.166 --> 14:52.125
(squeaking)

14:52.125 --> 14:53.458
Rolly:
He's got to be
in here somewhere.

14:53.458 --> 14:55.083
Found him.

14:56.958 --> 14:58.958
Rolly:
I'm pretty sure
he used to be fuzzier.

14:58.958 --> 15:01.208
Ugh, and he used to
have a nose.

15:01.208 --> 15:04.083
Yeah, you loved
this toy to pieces.

15:04.083 --> 15:05.625
We loved it so much

15:05.625 --> 15:07.083
that some of the pieces
came off.

15:07.083 --> 15:09.416
If we liked it that much
when we were puppies...

15:09.416 --> 15:11.125
You're still puppies.

15:11.125 --> 15:13.291

company while I'm at work, okay?

16:31.583 --> 16:34.208

16:34.208 --> 16:36.458
Aw, even though she's big,

16:36.458 --> 16:38.166
she's still just
a nervous puppy.

16:38.166 --> 16:39.708
Don't worry, Baby.

16:39.708 --> 16:40.750
It's our mission to be

16:40.750 --> 16:42.333

puppy-sitters ever.

for Baby to do.

17:16.291 --> 17:17.958
I know what I always wanna do.

17:17.958 --> 17:19.625
Eat.
You hungry, Baby?

17:19.625 --> 17:21.125
(vocalizes)

17:21.125 --> 17:23.291
The little one is for you,
and...

17:24.875 --> 17:26.333
Looks like
she loves her food.

17:26.333 --> 17:28.166
She loves our food, too.

17:33.250 --> 17:34.375
Baby, don't!

17:34.375 --> 17:37.333
We better get Baby outside
before she destroys the house!

17:37.333 --> 17:39.208
Rolly:
Who wants to go out?

17:39.208 --> 17:41.875
(barks)

17:44.750 --> 17:45.875
-Oops.
-Oops.

17:45.875 --> 17:47.500
What a mess.

17:47.500 --> 17:49.875
Cleaning up messes
makes A.R.F. happy.

17:49.875 --> 17:52.083
A.R.F., it's so good
to see you.

17:52.083 --> 17:55.333
If you like messes,
you're gonna love
the living room right now.

17:55.333 --> 17:56.833
Thanks for the help, A.R.F.

18:04.000 --> 18:05.333
(crash)

18:05.333 --> 18:06.458
Oh, no.

18:06.458 --> 18:09.000
Bow-whoa.

18:09.000 --> 18:11.833
We still have a lot
to learn about
puppy-sitting, don't we?

18:11.833 --> 18:14.583
Yeah, we have a lot to learn
about a lot of things.

18:14.583 --> 18:17.375
What did Bob's mom do
when she puppy-sat us?

18:17.375 --> 18:20.208
I don't know.
She helped us nap,
gave us food,

18:20.208 --> 18:22.333
taught us tricks
so we wouldn't ruin
the backyard.

18:22.333 --> 18:25.625
That's it!
Let's teach Baby
some puppy tricks.

18:25.625 --> 18:26.875
Hey, Baby!

18:26.875 --> 18:28.250
Sit.

18:28.250 --> 18:29.875
Huh?

18:29.875 --> 18:31.291
Sit on your bottom.

18:33.291 --> 18:34.750
Like this.

18:37.125 --> 18:39.000
Good sitting.
She did it, Rolly.

18:39.000 --> 18:40.333
(straining)
Yeah, I know.

18:40.333 --> 18:42.416
Now teach her to stand up.

18:42.416 --> 18:44.750
Bingo:
This is called "fetch."

18:44.750 --> 18:47.416
I throw the stick,
and Rolly brings it back.

18:49.833 --> 18:51.583
Ta-da!

18:51.583 --> 18:53.083
Now it's your turn, Baby.

18:53.083 --> 18:54.083
Bring back the stick.

18:55.083 --> 18:56.583
(barks)

18:56.583 --> 18:58.708
Not even Baby can make a mess
playing fetch in the backyard.

18:58.708 --> 18:59.708
(crashing)

19:02.000 --> 19:04.458
What I just said,
never mind.

19:04.458 --> 19:06.083
If we stay here,

19:06.083 --> 19:08.291
Baby might destroy
the whole yard!

19:08.291 --> 19:12.083
Then I think really great
puppy-sitters would take a puppy
to the dog park.

19:12.083 --> 19:13.333
Let's go!

19:16.291 --> 19:17.333
Sorry, Baby,

19:17.333 --> 19:19.625
but toys sometimes get lost
at the dog park.

19:19.625 --> 19:21.708
So you need to leave
the squeaky toy here.

19:21.708 --> 19:23.291
(whimpers)

19:25.333 --> 19:28.375
Welcome to... the dog park!

19:35.375 --> 19:37.250
You can climb on this thingy.

19:39.208 --> 19:40.458
Or jump over it.

19:44.000 --> 19:47.333
Wow, Baby's even faster
that you, Bingo.

19:47.333 --> 19:49.583
(panting)
No, we're the same
amount of fast.

19:49.583 --> 19:51.000
Her legs are just longer.

19:51.000 --> 19:52.416
Oh, that makes sense.

19:53.708 --> 19:55.375
Baby sure seems happy.

19:55.375 --> 19:57.375
Look at us being
great puppy-sitters.

19:57.375 --> 19:58.458
Stick!

20:00.958 --> 20:02.000
(squeaking)

20:03.208 --> 20:04.208
(barks)

20:06.625 --> 20:08.500
What's the big idea?

20:08.500 --> 20:09.875
That's mine!

20:09.875 --> 20:12.375
(squeaking)

20:12.375 --> 20:13.583
That's right!

20:13.583 --> 20:16.375
Go find your own squeaky toy.

20:16.375 --> 20:19.458
(whimpering)

20:20.500 --> 20:21.500
Huh.

20:23.458 --> 20:25.083
Thanks for letting us
play with you.

20:25.083 --> 20:28.458
Yep, yep, yep.
That was funsies.

20:28.458 --> 20:31.000
Now that's how
you play fetch, Baby.

20:32.125 --> 20:33.583
Baby?

20:33.583 --> 20:36.583
Are you looking for
that big drooly puppy

20:36.583 --> 20:38.583
that tried to take
my squeaky toy

20:38.583 --> 20:40.458
before she ran outta here?

20:40.458 --> 20:41.458
She ran away?

20:41.458 --> 20:43.083
Which way did she go?

20:43.083 --> 20:45.583
Somewhere over there.
I wasn't really
paying attention.

20:45.583 --> 20:50.375
(scoffs) Only you two
could lose the biggest puppy
in the dog park.

20:50.375 --> 20:52.375
You're right.
She is the biggest.

20:52.375 --> 20:55.583
Rolly, we just have to follow
the biggest paw prints.

20:55.583 --> 20:57.166
Like this one?

20:57.166 --> 20:58.625
Exactly like that one!

20:58.625 --> 21:01.291
(gasps)
And all those other ones!

21:01.291 --> 21:02.583
Follow those paw prints.

21:02.583 --> 21:04.416
Thanks, Cupcake.

21:04.416 --> 21:06.000
(angrily)
Oh, biscuits!

21:06.000 --> 21:08.458
I wasn't trying to help.

21:10.416 --> 21:13.166
Woman:
Oh, oh, for heaven's sake!

21:13.166 --> 21:16.250
I can't believe
that big, silly dog

21:16.250 --> 21:18.375
knocked us over, Frank.

21:18.375 --> 21:19.958
I can believe it...

21:19.958 --> 21:21.333
'cause it happened.

21:21.333 --> 21:23.458
It was really big and silly.

21:23.458 --> 21:25.875
Baby is big,
and she's silly.

21:25.875 --> 21:27.291
Then we're on the right track.

21:29.166 --> 21:31.208
Maybe Cagey's seen Baby.

21:31.208 --> 21:32.416
You in there, Cagey?

21:32.416 --> 21:33.958
Yeah, but I can't see you

21:33.958 --> 21:37.208
through all the doggy slobbers
smeared on my window.

21:37.208 --> 21:39.416
Where did the doggy slobber
come from?

21:39.416 --> 21:41.208
Some silly dog.

21:41.208 --> 21:42.416
Both:
Baby!

21:42.416 --> 21:44.458
She didn't look like
a baby to me.

21:44.458 --> 21:46.083
She was massive!

21:46.083 --> 21:47.583
Huge, I tell ya!

21:47.583 --> 21:49.250
She ran off that way.

21:49.250 --> 21:51.583
That's the same direction
as our house.

21:51.583 --> 21:53.458
I wonder where she's going.

21:53.458 --> 21:55.291
Rolly, I think
I figured it out.

21:55.291 --> 21:58.958
Baby was trying to play
with Cupcake's squeaky toy
right before she ran off.

21:58.958 --> 22:02.583
-So...
-She's going back to our house
for Mr. Mousey.

22:02.583 --> 22:04.291
It seems so obvious now.

22:04.291 --> 22:05.625
Follow me.

22:05.625 --> 22:07.166
Thanks, Cagey.

22:07.166 --> 22:08.875
You're welcome.

22:08.875 --> 22:11.416
Hey, can somebody
wipe off the window?

22:12.500 --> 22:15.291
(barking)

22:24.250 --> 22:26.458
I knew it!
She did want Mr. Mousey.

22:32.000 --> 22:34.375
I've been throwing this thing
since she got back.

22:34.375 --> 22:35.958
I got to admit,

22:35.958 --> 22:38.583
it is kinda fun
to have a puppy around
to play this game again.

22:39.708 --> 22:41.583
You know,
we're still puppies, too.

22:41.583 --> 22:43.583
Oh, you are, huh?

22:43.583 --> 22:45.833
I mean, we're still
a little bit little.

22:45.833 --> 22:48.458
Then get in this game.
There's room for two more.

22:48.458 --> 22:49.708
-Yes!
-You're on.

22:49.708 --> 22:51.708
Baby, drop it.

22:52.708 --> 22:54.958
Ugh, puppy slobber.

22:56.208 --> 22:57.458
(squeaking)

22:57.458 --> 22:58.583
-I got it.
-Mine!

22:58.583 --> 23:00.416
-(barking)
-(laughing)

23:01.500 --> 23:03.833
(snoring)

23:04.833 --> 23:08.125
Wow, the puppy really
tuckered you out, huh?

23:08.125 --> 23:11.250
Looks like you guys ended up
being great puppy-sitters.

23:13.500 --> 23:14.625
Mission accomplished.

23:14.625 --> 23:16.083
High-paw, Rolly.

23:16.083 --> 23:17.583
High-paw, Bingo.

23:17.583 --> 23:19.333
High-paw, Hissy.

23:19.333 --> 23:22.625
Hmm? Yeah, yeah.
High-paw.

23:22.625 --> 23:25.125
(snoring)

23:31.500 --> 23:33.875
(theme music playing)

23:35.875 --> 23:37.333
Bark! Bark! Bark!

23:41.208 --> 23:42.416
Bark! Bark! Bark!

23:43.583 --> 23:46.166
(record scratching)

23:52.208 --> 23:53.458
Bark!

23:56.708 --> 23:58.583
Bark! Bark! Bark!
