00:21.400 --> 00:23.480
I'll tell you what.
You find Patient Zero,

00:23.520 --> 00:26.400
- I'll find a way to get the drugs to Africa.
- You got a deal.

00:26.720 --> 00:29.280
- Where is she now?
- She's dead.

00:29.560 --> 00:31.560
It's a sick fucking disease.

00:31.800 --> 00:33.960
Ruby ate all that infected chicken...

00:34.080 --> 00:36.520
We need answers... please.

00:36.760 --> 00:39.840
Look, you've got to exhume that body.
We need a sample of the brain tissue.

00:39.960 --> 00:42.720
What we should do, is...
We should...

00:45.680 --> 00:48.480
Do you know
what's it's like to lose a child?

00:48.600 --> 00:50.120
I know if I lost my son,

00:50.240 --> 00:52.280
I'd hardly be able to breathe.

00:52.440 --> 00:54.560
- You're not divorced.
- No.

00:55.440 --> 00:56.680
I did not deceive Nicole

00:56.800 --> 00:58.200
by enjoying an evening with you.

00:58.760 --> 01:00.560
No. You deceived me.

01:05.560 --> 01:06.640
What?

01:08.000 --> 01:09.600
Your father's a fucking genius.

01:09.720 --> 01:11.720
Logically we assume
that there is no logic...

01:11.800 --> 01:13.200
We try every drug.

01:13.360 --> 01:14.600
- That's crazy.
- Thank you.

01:14.880 --> 01:17.440
He had a stroke.
Never woke up again.

01:17.840 --> 01:19.120
He had a stroke ?

01:19.360 --> 01:22.000
Oh, Bob, what are you doing here?

01:22.480 --> 01:24.760
- He's so young.
- Bob, meet Glenn.

01:25.040 --> 01:26.120
Hi, Glenn.

01:26.280 --> 01:28.320
You should think about the future.

01:28.640 --> 01:30.560
Now Richard has one.

01:42.320 --> 01:44.360
Hello. Thank you for coming this evening.

01:44.520 --> 01:47.040
The impact of the South Asian haze
can be defined as follow.

01:47.120 --> 01:48.640
- Bob.
- Follows.

01:48.920 --> 01:50.760
Spatial and temporal
mean solar energy is reduced

01:50.880 --> 01:53.040
by as much as 14 megawatts
to the negative power of 2.

01:53.160 --> 01:54.320
- Bob.
- What?

01:54.400 --> 01:57.120
Eyes, Bob.Eyes?
Look out. Out here.

01:58.360 --> 02:01.560
You gotta make eye contact,
Bob. Establish trust.

02:01.840 --> 02:04.360
- Speak to me.
- But I have to look at my notes.

02:04.480 --> 02:06.480
Remember? You said so,
"Write it all down."

02:06.600 --> 02:09.160
Yes. I did say that.
I also said "Refer to your notes".

02:09.280 --> 02:12.000
Not attach yourself to them
like some kind of mollusk.

02:18.600 --> 02:19.960
<i>- Yeah.
- Taxi.</i>

02:20.160 --> 02:21.200
Be right down.

02:21.360 --> 02:22.840
So look at me, OK?

02:22.960 --> 02:24.920
Or anybody. Somebody.

02:25.400 --> 02:27.760
You're going to be speaking
to a room full of your peers, Bob,

02:27.920 --> 02:29.520
- so own the room.
- Okay.

02:29.720 --> 02:31.920
This is a very incredible thing
you've done.

02:33.400 --> 02:35.720
The impact of the South Asian Haze

02:35.960 --> 02:37.760
can be defined as follows...

02:39.000 --> 02:40.400
Oh, sorry.

02:42.360 --> 02:44.840
The cloud estimated to be 3 km thick,
is responsible for hundreds of thousands

02:44.960 --> 02:47.240
- of deaths of severe respiratory disease.
- Slower, Bob.

02:47.400 --> 02:51.600
Asia's Brown haze is altering
the weather, creating acid rain.

02:51.840 --> 02:54.440
The dangerous haze lies over
the entire Indian Subcontinent,

02:54.800 --> 02:57.080
- from Sri Lanka to Afghanistan...
- Better.

02:57.200 --> 02:59.440
Oddly it has sparked flooding
in Bangladesh, Nepal and--

02:59.640 --> 03:00.640
- Look up.
- I am.

03:00.880 --> 03:02.120
- You're not.
- I'm gonna be car sick.

03:02.280 --> 03:03.880
- Bob!
- I can't do this.

03:04.000 --> 03:04.960
Sure, you can.

03:06.400 --> 03:08.760
I'm hungry. I need a shower.

03:09.360 --> 03:11.640
- I need to talk to Caroline.
- What? Why?

03:11.800 --> 03:13.080
I'm nervous.

03:13.280 --> 03:15.520
Nervous is good. It's charming.

03:16.760 --> 03:20.480
I'm not -- what did you say --
"modulating" my voice?

03:20.640 --> 03:23.160
We talked about this, Bob.
They're gonna have a microphone for you

03:23.280 --> 03:24.200
on the podium.

03:24.280 --> 03:26.480
Sure. That will be good.
Something to hold on to.

03:27.000 --> 03:28.600
And I'll be right there for you.

03:30.240 --> 03:31.400
You will?

03:31.560 --> 03:33.600
Yeah! Hand-to-heart, front row.

03:33.760 --> 03:35.720
So if you even start feeling
the slightest bit,

03:35.800 --> 03:39.600
you know, uncertain,
you just look out for my smiling face.

03:39.760 --> 03:40.720
OK?

03:43.120 --> 03:44.400
I can't do this.

03:44.760 --> 03:46.760
Yes you can, Bob.

03:46.960 --> 03:48.280
Come on, Bob.

03:49.200 --> 03:50.720
Come on, Bob.

03:54.760 --> 03:55.760
Please...

03:55.840 --> 03:57.920
Let's go, time is money.

03:58.000 --> 03:58.720
Thanks.

05:30.960 --> 05:33.760
2.04 Dim & Dimmer

05:34.200 --> 05:35.680
Carlos? Carlos.

05:35.840 --> 05:38.080
- Hi. Do you have a sec?
- Uh, I was just about to--

05:38.240 --> 05:39.960
Great. Listen... Hum

05:42.320 --> 05:44.800
I-- Well, for the last six months,

05:44.920 --> 05:47.360
I've been conducting a study
for the Diabetes Society.

05:47.560 --> 05:50.600
Attempting to differentiate and stabilize
pancreatic cells in culture...

05:50.840 --> 05:53.440
Yes, that's right.
Insulin producing cells.

05:53.560 --> 05:54.600
And...

05:59.880 --> 06:01.480
I think I've done it.

06:01.760 --> 06:04.240
Insulin producing cells in the pancreas.

06:05.640 --> 06:09.400
Jill, you're talking about
a cure for juvenile diabetes.

06:09.560 --> 06:11.520
I know. But I said I "think".

06:11.760 --> 06:13.080
- You think?
- Yeah. I mean...

06:13.720 --> 06:15.200
The protocols need to be--

06:15.320 --> 06:16.960
- Of course.
- Looked at. You know, again.

06:17.120 --> 06:18.920
- Naturally.
- You know... I've checked them.

06:19.000 --> 06:20.400
I have checked them...
I've rechecked them,

06:20.560 --> 06:22.520
- and triple checked them.
- Yes. It's time to publish!

06:22.600 --> 06:23.880
You put this
in Science or Nature or--

06:23.920 --> 06:25.800
- No, no. Not yet.
- Of course "yet."

06:25.880 --> 06:28.080
No.  I haven't even told David.

06:28.120 --> 06:29.160
And...

06:30.400 --> 06:31.880
Before this goes out to anyone,

06:32.040 --> 06:34.000
I really need to make
sure that it's sound.

06:34.200 --> 06:36.320
- Yes...
- Will you help me?

06:36.560 --> 06:38.280
Of course I'll help you, Jill.

06:38.960 --> 06:40.360
We  will go check everything.

06:40.480 --> 06:41.440
Come on!

06:45.560 --> 06:48.040
The House of Poe.
There should be one not too far from here.

06:48.080 --> 06:50.280
We have 3 hours before the conference.
That should give us enough time.

06:50.400 --> 06:53.000
- Eat your breakfast.
- There was a cottage in the Bronx

06:53.200 --> 06:55.360
and a farm on
the Upper West Side.

06:55.760 --> 06:56.760
Gimme that.

06:56.840 --> 06:59.120
- And a house on West 3rd.
- You can't eat it like this.

06:59.200 --> 07:01.960
Of course it was called Amity Street
when he-- What did you say?

07:02.120 --> 07:04.200
I said, you can't eat it just like that,
you got to put stuff on it

07:04.320 --> 07:07.200
- and grow hair on your chest!
- Oh. Poe is a genius, ahead of his time.

07:07.320 --> 07:09.000
To this day I can still quote The Raven.

07:09.160 --> 07:11.240
Or perhaps I should I say: "quoth"?

07:11.400 --> 07:12.920
Perhaps you should shut the fuck up

07:13.000 --> 07:14.720
and eat your breakfast
or we're not going--

07:14.880 --> 07:16.360
Hey! Come on Bob!

07:36.320 --> 07:37.640
Oh! Shit!

07:38.240 --> 07:40.240
- Maybe it's for the best.
- For the best, Bob?

07:40.440 --> 07:41.880
- Well...
- My cell phone,

07:41.960 --> 07:44.960
passport, ticket home,
your slide presentation.

07:45.400 --> 07:46.920
Maybe we should go back.

07:47.080 --> 07:49.000
How could he just disappear like that?

07:49.320 --> 07:51.280
We passed a subway entrance
half a block back.

07:51.400 --> 07:53.320
No, no, I had him in my sights
the whole time.

07:53.440 --> 07:54.680
- There! There!
- Where?

07:55.440 --> 07:56.560
Come on Bob!

07:56.760 --> 07:59.080
David, stop!
You don't know what's in there.

08:10.160 --> 08:11.280
Fuck it.

08:34.240 --> 08:35.480
Nice...

08:44.240 --> 08:46.640
You're paying for the shirt, asshole.

09:11.040 --> 09:13.240
So you're staying
in Toronto a few more days?

09:13.360 --> 09:16.640
Yeah, yeah. I got a couple
of colleagues in from Germany

09:16.720 --> 09:18.600
that I haven't seen
for years. Thanks man.

09:18.800 --> 09:21.000
Thought I'd catch up with them
while they're in town.

09:21.120 --> 09:23.240
Then, back to London.

09:24.000 --> 09:26.160
Right. Yes. Yep. But...

09:26.560 --> 09:28.440
But I'll probably be back. You know?

09:34.720 --> 09:36.280
You don't want me here.

09:36.480 --> 09:38.280
I do. I do.

09:39.240 --> 09:41.160
But you have a wife

09:42.080 --> 09:45.800
and having you here would just
force me to do things beyond my control.

09:46.720 --> 09:49.800
I wouldn't want to resent
you for driving me to those places.

09:50.040 --> 09:50.920
You know?

09:52.160 --> 09:53.840
So... I think...

09:53.960 --> 09:56.520
the best thing you can do for me...

09:58.400 --> 10:00.880
is to stay far, far away.

10:04.240 --> 10:06.480
That sucks a great deal.

10:09.120 --> 10:12.080
Here I'll go down on you... With!

10:12.960 --> 10:14.240
With... uh...

10:14.360 --> 10:15.840
Go down with you.

10:33.040 --> 10:33.880
Hey!

10:41.200 --> 10:44.600
I'm not quite sure how to say this,
so I'm just... I'm just going to say it.

10:44.960 --> 10:45.960
What?

10:47.160 --> 10:50.760
I think you've found
the cure to juvenile diabetes.

10:53.840 --> 10:56.960
I think that's the nicest thing
anybody's ever said to me.

10:57.280 --> 10:58.440
Oh, my God!

10:58.960 --> 11:01.600
Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
And there's no doubt in your mind?

11:01.760 --> 11:05.080
Jill, you proved you could
generate 95% of insulin producing cells.

11:05.360 --> 11:06.760
Ninety-five percent, Jill!

11:06.800 --> 11:09.280
I know. I know. I know.
But there's still so many questions.

11:09.400 --> 11:11.040
I mean, how stable are the cells?

11:11.080 --> 11:12.640
How much insulin are they producing?

11:12.680 --> 11:15.800
Further study is needed.
But the evidence is clear, at least, to me.

11:16.320 --> 11:17.320
Okay.

11:17.440 --> 11:18.920
And you don't think...

11:19.120 --> 11:20.800
Think what? Think what?

11:21.040 --> 11:24.320
That in my eagerness to get results,
I mean the results that I wanted--

11:24.440 --> 11:26.840
I have seen all your work, okay.
You took your time.

11:26.960 --> 11:29.040
I personally would have no problem
putting my name to this.

11:29.560 --> 11:30.520
Really?

11:31.200 --> 11:33.520
You're going to win
the Nobel Prize for this, Jill.

11:34.080 --> 11:36.680
I'm going to win the Nobel Prize!

11:36.960 --> 11:40.040
I have to call somebody.
I have to... Who do I call?

11:40.440 --> 11:41.560
- Your mother?
- No.

11:42.000 --> 11:43.280
- My mother?
- Ha! Ha!

11:43.480 --> 11:45.080
No, no. Wait, wait, wait.

11:52.280 --> 11:53.240
Yeah?

11:54.320 --> 11:55.120
Hello?

11:55.920 --> 11:57.560
- Yeah?
- Who is this?

11:57.880 --> 11:58.880
Who are you looking for?

11:59.240 --> 12:00.640
I'm sorry, I must have the wrong number.

12:00.720 --> 12:02.080
Yeah, you must.

12:02.720 --> 12:03.520
Wait.

12:03.640 --> 12:05.040
- David?
- Hmm-hmm.

12:13.440 --> 12:14.440
What?

12:14.840 --> 12:16.680
- It's the same guy.
- Is this you again?

12:16.920 --> 12:18.240
Who am I speaking to please?

12:18.360 --> 12:19.840
Who are you speaking to?

12:20.000 --> 12:21.840
Uh... The party to which you're
connected to, bitch.

12:22.600 --> 12:23.360
O h...

12:23.600 --> 12:24.360
Look...

12:25.640 --> 12:26.560
Hello?

13:06.080 --> 13:07.440
Hey, kid!

13:08.680 --> 13:10.480
I'll stay all day, if I have to.

13:15.120 --> 13:16.760
What the fuck
am I doing down here?

13:16.840 --> 13:19.760
Playing  hero?
Yeah, good science cop, that's me.

13:21.800 --> 13:25.160
Well, either David's lost his cell phone
or he's finally hitting puberty.

13:25.400 --> 13:27.080
Do you think we need to be worried?

13:27.320 --> 13:29.240
For David? He'll be fine.

13:29.600 --> 13:30.760
You're right.

13:31.320 --> 13:32.760
- You trying him again?
- No.

13:33.040 --> 13:34.640
No... Diabetes Society.

13:34.720 --> 13:37.560
The Guy who's funding me is
under a lot of pressure to get results.

13:38.080 --> 13:39.320
Hello Norm.

13:39.400 --> 13:41.240
Hi. It's Jill Langston, calling.

13:41.680 --> 13:44.320
Well, I may have some good news for you.

13:45.000 --> 13:47.280
The most direct effect
is a significant radiation

13:47.400 --> 13:49.400
in the solar reduction reaching the...

13:51.480 --> 13:54.120
The most direct effect
is a significant reduction

13:54.280 --> 13:57.360
in the solar radiation
reaching the Earth's sur... face.

14:05.000 --> 14:07.000
I can help you with your homework.

14:10.120 --> 14:12.960
Oh. It's not homework. It's a report.

14:13.200 --> 14:15.600
- About what?
- The Asian Brown Cloud.

14:17.080 --> 14:19.040
She works at Maxie's on 27th?

14:20.600 --> 14:21.360
Huh?

14:21.640 --> 14:24.040
- She's a stripper, right?
- Stripper? No. No, she's a...

14:24.960 --> 14:27.200
It's a massive cloud of air pollution

14:27.280 --> 14:29.280
that threatens 60% of
the world's population.

14:30.600 --> 14:31.400
No shit.

14:31.560 --> 14:34.280
Oh, completely.
It significantly reduces the amount

14:34.320 --> 14:36.720
of solar radiation
reaching the earth's surface.

14:37.480 --> 14:38.480
You mean sunlight?

14:41.320 --> 14:42.320
Sure.

14:42.760 --> 14:44.920
Then there's the increased
danger of thermal inversion.

14:45.320 --> 14:46.160
Uh-huh.

14:46.400 --> 14:49.080
Would you like to hear
about thermal inversion?

14:49.320 --> 14:50.440
Hell yeah.

14:53.080 --> 14:54.360
Okay. Hit me.

14:56.200 --> 14:58.600
Good afternoon. Thank you for coming.

15:00.160 --> 15:03.160
The impact of the South
Asian Haze can be defined as follows.

15:03.320 --> 15:05.520
Spatial and temporal mean
solar energy is reduced

15:05.640 --> 15:08.320
by as much as 14 megawatts
to the negative power of 2.

15:08.480 --> 15:10.120
Two independent model studies that the...

15:20.680 --> 15:22.880
You really think
it's safe to be down here?

15:23.680 --> 15:25.440
Well, I'm a Canadian.

15:25.680 --> 15:27.760
We tend to give people
the benefit of the doubt.

15:27.920 --> 15:30.360
- Big mistake.
- I want my bag back, kid.

15:30.520 --> 15:32.200
You David Sandstrom?

15:32.600 --> 15:34.000
Okay. Who are you?

15:35.240 --> 15:36.280
Hey!

15:37.720 --> 15:38.680
Hey!

15:38.920 --> 15:40.440
You want your bag back or what?

15:40.480 --> 15:41.480
Owen.

15:41.720 --> 15:43.320
He don't belong down here.

15:43.520 --> 15:45.280
Don't worry about it. He's with me.

15:45.440 --> 15:47.480
You better not go tellin'
nobody we're down here.

15:47.760 --> 15:49.000
I wouldn't think about it.

15:49.360 --> 15:51.440
Look, he's a doctor. I need him.

15:52.120 --> 15:53.640
He's not welcome down here.

15:54.840 --> 15:56.480
Yeah. It's cool man.

16:01.640 --> 16:02.920
Come on.

16:04.840 --> 16:07.120
Look, kid,
just give me my shit back, okay.

16:07.280 --> 16:08.760
I'm not gonna call the cops.

16:11.040 --> 16:13.040
How'd you know I was a doctor?

16:15.360 --> 16:16.800
Oh. Right.

16:19.800 --> 16:22.040
So  what are you? Fifteen? Sixteen?

16:22.120 --> 16:23.400
Fuck you.

16:23.520 --> 16:24.600
Fifteen!

16:25.720 --> 16:28.000
This is a cozy place you got here.

16:29.400 --> 16:31.920
How many people you got
squatting down here, anyway?

16:33.280 --> 16:35.960
You know what, just
give me back my stuff and I'll go.

16:36.040 --> 16:36.880
Fuck.

16:36.960 --> 16:38.240
- What?
- Celine Dion.

16:39.320 --> 16:40.600
Coldplay.

16:41.480 --> 16:42.800
Bjork.

16:42.880 --> 16:44.040
Chick pod.

16:44.160 --> 16:45.720
What's wrong with Bjork?

16:47.080 --> 16:50.240
I will pay you for the fucking bag, okay.
Name your price.

16:50.320 --> 16:52.520
- I don't want your money.
- What do you want then?
// FIN PARTIE 1

16:55.600 --> 16:56.760
She's sick.

16:57.080 --> 16:58.520
Sick?

17:02.440 --> 17:03.720
Oh, shit.

17:05.079 --> 17:06.160
You...

17:07.040 --> 17:09.040
You think I'm a doctor doctor, right?

17:09.200 --> 17:11.000
That's what it says on your dog tags.

17:11.119 --> 17:13.240
Ph.D., not M.D.

17:13.920 --> 17:16.319
I don't run around with a stethoscope
and an insurance form.

17:16.440 --> 17:18.440
I'm a molecular biologist, kid.

17:22.480 --> 17:24.119
Have you tried taking her to a clinic?

17:24.240 --> 17:27.440
Yeah, free clinic. Walk-in place
for people with no insurance.

17:28.160 --> 17:29.920
- Must have been a long line.
- Yup.

17:30.200 --> 17:32.640
Around the block
and by the time they got to her

17:32.680 --> 17:34.480
she couldn't stand on her own two feet.

17:34.600 --> 17:36.920
They took her for a junkie
and then they washed their hands of her.

17:37.080 --> 17:39.360
- Just like you.
- Hey. You're missing the point.

17:39.680 --> 17:41.800
You telling me that
you haven't had any medical training?

17:41.920 --> 17:44.920
That in your line of work,
you can't tell what's making somebody sick?

17:46.680 --> 17:47.640
Okay.

17:48.200 --> 17:50.240
- Okay, what?
- Okay.

17:54.200 --> 17:56.200
Sunshine and me...

17:56.840 --> 17:59.360
we survived down here together.
It's okay.

17:59.480 --> 18:01.920
We need each other. It's okay. It's okay.

18:04.360 --> 18:06.960
You really need to get her out of here
into a hospital have her checked out.

18:07.080 --> 18:09.400
I already told you.
She's been checked out.

18:09.520 --> 18:12.160
I mean, They said there
was nothing they could do. I mean...

18:13.000 --> 18:14.280
Read her file.

18:14.360 --> 18:16.480
Do you see anything
wrong with her?

18:16.640 --> 18:18.440
Just do me a favor and read it.

18:22.080 --> 18:24.280
No. Sunshine, stop.
Sunshine. Sunshine, no.

18:29.640 --> 18:31.200
No, no, no, no.

18:31.400 --> 18:33.280
- Don't bite yourself.
- Okay.

18:34.120 --> 18:36.920
Alright. Just have to take
a look at something here. It's okay.

18:37.080 --> 18:38.240
It's okay...

18:43.120 --> 18:44.560
Dude, she doesn't shoot.

18:45.360 --> 18:47.600
Well, her file says there were traces of

18:47.640 --> 18:49.520
cocaine and methedrine
in her blood. So...

18:49.640 --> 18:52.240
Yeah, well she doesn't shoot.
I mean, she might take a toke,

18:52.400 --> 18:53.960
or whatever, but just recreational.

18:54.120 --> 18:56.160
- Hey, hey, hey!
- How long's she been like this?

18:56.480 --> 18:58.480
A couple of weeks ago,
she started feeling bad.

18:58.640 --> 19:02.160
And then she started getting
dizzy and she lost her appetite.

19:02.280 --> 19:03.760
Is she getting any fluids?

19:03.920 --> 19:07.760
She's getting them but she's not keeping
them down. Sunshine, you gotta stop.

19:08.040 --> 19:11.280
- She's doing this a lot, eh?
- With her shoulders? Yeah.

19:13.240 --> 19:14.240
Sunshine,

19:14.680 --> 19:16.520
my name is David.
Can you hear me?

19:17.000 --> 19:17.640
Hurts...

19:17.840 --> 19:20.080
Hurts? Where does it hurt, Sunshine,
where's the pain?

19:21.120 --> 19:22.360
Get it out...

19:22.440 --> 19:24.360
- Get it out of me!
- No. No.

19:24.520 --> 19:25.960
- Get it out of me!
- No. Sunshine...

19:26.120 --> 19:27.920
Sunshine. You gotta stop,
okay. You gotta stop.

19:28.000 --> 19:29.320
That's it, we're taking her up.

19:29.440 --> 19:31.120
- Up?
- Up. Up. As in, up.

19:31.240 --> 19:33.080
Look, the's nothing in her blood,
there's nothing in her file.

19:33.200 --> 19:34.960
Her white cells are okay,
there's no infection...

19:35.040 --> 19:37.080
- Then what the hell is wrong with her?
- I don't know.

19:37.200 --> 19:40.200
- Maybe it's in her head.
- Dude, she's not fucking crazy, okay.

19:40.320 --> 19:43.800
Look, drugs, malnutrition.
She needs to see a fucking doctor.

19:43.960 --> 19:45.840
I  already told you,
she's been to see a doctor.

19:45.880 --> 19:47.560
Fuck this shit,
we're taking her to a hospital.

19:47.640 --> 19:50.200
- No. A fucking mental hospital?
- Gimme my phone.

19:50.360 --> 19:53.400
Okay? I'll make some calls.
I'll get her in somewhere.

19:53.920 --> 19:55.120
My phone?

19:55.800 --> 19:57.440
Look, I didn't take anything.

19:57.560 --> 19:59.000
Oh. I appreciate that.

19:59.360 --> 20:00.520
Come on, let's get her up.

20:00.760 --> 20:03.000
Hey, hey. I got it. Okay, Sunshine.

20:03.080 --> 20:04.760
Come on. We got to get up now.

20:05.000 --> 20:06.520
We got to get up. Come on.

20:09.720 --> 20:10.840
Okay?

20:12.680 --> 20:14.600
It even affects the size of raindrops.

20:14.680 --> 20:15.720
How's that?

20:15.800 --> 20:17.160
It's complicated.

20:18.440 --> 20:19.800
Did that hurt?

20:20.200 --> 20:22.680
I'm thinking about getting a tattoo.

20:22.840 --> 20:24.680
But I heard it really hurts.

20:24.880 --> 20:27.120
It's not so bad. I mean,
it depends where you get it.

20:27.200 --> 20:28.560
- Like I have one right here...
- Yeah?

20:28.680 --> 20:29.920
And that one hurt really bad.

20:30.800 --> 20:32.120
David! What happened?

20:32.240 --> 20:34.320
- Bob, I'm surprised at you.
- Why?

20:36.960 --> 20:38.320
Oh. No.

20:38.880 --> 20:40.200
This is Sandy.

20:40.320 --> 20:43.240
We were talking about the
Asian Brown Cloud and tattoos.

20:43.520 --> 20:46.080
- Of course you were, Bob.
- You got the bag!

20:46.240 --> 20:48.400
- Are the slides in there?
- I got everything, Bob.

20:48.560 --> 20:50.320
Plus a little extra.

20:51.840 --> 20:52.600
Oh.

20:52.800 --> 20:55.000
- Honey, you don't look so good.
- David?

20:55.160 --> 20:57.040
- I'll explain on the way.
- On the way?

20:57.160 --> 20:59.240
- Where do we get a cab around here?
- Oh, I can help you out.

20:59.360 --> 21:01.000
I have a way with cab drivers.

21:06.160 --> 21:07.920
Yeah, get me the number for Bellevue.

21:10.440 --> 21:12.760
So what were you guys doing down there?

21:12.840 --> 21:14.600
They live down there, Bob.

21:14.680 --> 21:16.640
Really, I heard about that once.

21:16.880 --> 21:18.840
But I thought it was an urban legend.

21:18.920 --> 21:20.880
- Do I look like an urban legend?
- No.

21:22.240 --> 21:24.240
You get a free ride
wherever you want to go.

21:24.400 --> 21:25.480
Oh, great. Great.

21:32.800 --> 21:34.200
- Thanks for listening.
- Sure.

21:34.960 --> 21:36.720
"Asian Brown Cloud."

21:36.840 --> 21:38.120
It's a good name.

21:39.040 --> 21:40.720
- Good luck, Bob.
- Bye.

21:47.920 --> 21:51.040
So... What's a psychological profile?

21:51.320 --> 21:52.560
It's all good.

21:52.800 --> 21:55.040
It means they'll watch her.

21:55.200 --> 21:57.800
Give her medication for anxiety,

21:57.920 --> 21:59.960
depression,
whatever they think is going on.

22:00.040 --> 22:01.880
Yeah, but I don't want them
to mess with her head.

22:02.000 --> 22:04.600
Owen, listen to me. She's in a good place.
That's what you want, right.

22:04.680 --> 22:06.200
- Yeah.
- Then don't do this.

22:06.280 --> 22:08.040
Let the doctors check her out
and see what's in her head.

22:08.280 --> 22:10.680
- What if they send her back?
- What do you mean?

22:10.880 --> 22:13.520
She ran away a year ago.
And her parents, she's been talkin' to them.

22:13.640 --> 22:16.200
- They want her to come home.
- That wouldn't be so bad, would it?

22:16.320 --> 22:18.600
- Dude, she hates them.
- Why, are they abusive?

22:18.920 --> 22:21.080
No. They just. They freak her out.

22:22.400 --> 22:24.160
I'm old enough to be your dad, right?

22:24.360 --> 22:26.840
- Do I freak you out?
- No, you've been all right.

22:27.080 --> 22:30.520
Well, I got a daughter about your age
and I totally freak her out, don't I, Bob?

22:30.840 --> 22:31.880
Totally.

22:32.320 --> 22:34.840
- Where is she?
- She lives in B.C. with her mom.

22:34.920 --> 22:37.080
Who, by the way,
freaks her out even more than me.

22:37.240 --> 22:40.200
You see? It's what parents do, man,
it's part of the job description.

22:40.680 --> 22:42.280
Can I buy you
a cab ride home?

22:42.400 --> 22:45.000
No. I'm going to go
see how Sunshine's doing.

22:45.440 --> 22:48.680
Alright. Well, go buy her a magazine
or some candy or something.

22:48.800 --> 22:50.720
Thanks. Really. Thanks man.

22:50.880 --> 22:52.080
Sure.

22:56.880 --> 22:58.440
- We got to go.
- Yeah.

22:58.600 --> 23:00.760
I've already missed 2 lectures,
David. Where are we?

23:00.880 --> 23:02.960
I really don't want
to miss one this afternoon.

23:03.040 --> 23:05.520
I've got to go back to the hotel
and take a shower.

23:52.600 --> 23:54.040
How sure are you?

23:54.280 --> 23:56.800
David. Hi.
What's going on? I tried calling you.

23:57.000 --> 23:59.640
Yeah, yeah. That's a long story.
Look, you really think you've got it?

23:59.760 --> 24:02.800
Well, there's still some
work to be done but...

24:03.000 --> 24:05.760
- How soon can you get down here?
- You want me to fly to New York?

24:05.880 --> 24:08.480
Yeah, you can get down here
in what, probably a few hours right?

24:08.600 --> 24:10.520
I've got to see that data. I mean...

24:10.720 --> 24:13.160
A cure for Diabetes
can't wait till I get back.

24:13.520 --> 24:18.160
And over this period, I measured
a 2 to 3% drop in sunlight, worldwide.

24:18.360 --> 24:21.160
Rates vary, and exact
measurements are difficult

24:21.320 --> 24:23.520
due to calibration problems
with the instruments

24:23.600 --> 24:26.160
and a correspondent problem
of spatial coverage.

24:28.280 --> 24:30.920
Experiments in the Maldives in the 1990s

24:31.040 --> 24:33.360
showed that the effect of
macroscopic pollutants

24:33.480 --> 24:36.480
in the atmosphere at that time,
blown south from India,

24:36.880 --> 24:40.080
caused about a 10% reduction in
sunlight reaching the surface

24:40.200 --> 24:42.160
in the area under the pollution cloud.

24:42.680 --> 24:44.800
A much greater reduction
than was expected.

24:44.880 --> 24:46.040
She's good.

24:48.280 --> 24:50.000
- You're amazing.
- Stop it.

24:50.120 --> 24:52.080
No, I'm serious.
Parker & Norberg in Geneva,

24:52.160 --> 24:54.920
and the "Alberta Boys" up in Edmonton.
They've been trying to produce stable,

24:55.080 --> 24:57.520
insulin-producing cells
for years, and you did it.

24:58.080 --> 25:01.520
You did it. And combining elements
from two different stem cell lines...

25:02.080 --> 25:03.880
It's fucking brilliant, Jill.

25:06.720 --> 25:07.800
Take me through it.

25:08.000 --> 25:10.880
Ah, well, I was able to develop cells

25:10.960 --> 25:13.640
from Line A into pancreatic beta cells.
But we couldn't get them

25:13.800 --> 25:15.720
to stabilize, let alone grow. So...

25:15.840 --> 25:18.680
we found Line B,
which produced a factor that,

25:18.800 --> 25:21.680
when added to Line A,
not only stabilized the beta cells, but

25:21.760 --> 25:23.400
stimulated insulin production.

25:24.360 --> 25:26.120
Uh... Fit tab B into slot A.

25:26.360 --> 25:27.920
- So it would seem.
- So the question is,

25:28.040 --> 25:31.040
what's in the supernatant of Line B
that's inducing Line A cells to grow?

25:31.240 --> 25:34.600
- That is the question, yes.
- And you will find the answer.

25:34.720 --> 25:36.160
We got to celebrate.

25:36.280 --> 25:37.840
Champagne?

25:40.960 --> 25:41.840
David...

25:42.760 --> 25:43.920
- What?
- Well...

25:45.720 --> 25:47.440
You and me

25:47.560 --> 25:49.920
in a hotel room. Champagne.

25:50.000 --> 25:51.760
A fucking cure for diabetes.

25:52.120 --> 25:53.480
Yeah...

25:53.640 --> 25:55.600
...a fucking cure for diabetes.

25:56.280 --> 25:58.200
- Where did you get them?
- Them?

25:58.320 --> 26:00.280
- The stem cells.
- Ah, the stem cells.

26:00.480 --> 26:03.440
Line A's from San Francisco. It was
one of the few that Bush sanctioned.

26:03.560 --> 26:05.600
- Line B?
- Korea. Not sanctioned.

26:05.840 --> 26:06.960
- By the U.S.
- Right.

26:07.080 --> 26:08.600
Fuck em. We're not doing work in the U.S.

26:08.720 --> 26:09.640
- David...
- No.

26:09.760 --> 26:11.400
All I want you to worry about right now

26:11.520 --> 26:13.520
is figuring out what
makes it tick. Okay?

26:13.600 --> 26:15.080
- Okay.
- And whatever you do,

26:15.160 --> 26:17.840
don't mention this
to the Diabetes Society. Right?

26:18.160 --> 26:18.960
Right.

26:19.040 --> 26:20.520
Because the last thing you need right now

26:20.600 --> 26:23.480
is a press conference screaming
"Miracle Cure for Diabetes!"

26:24.080 --> 26:26.680
But what you do deserve, is a toast.

26:26.760 --> 26:28.440
A small toast of Champagne

26:29.680 --> 26:31.480
to celebrate the single most

26:31.560 --> 26:34.440
amazing and incredible thing
you have ever done.

26:35.360 --> 26:36.200
Wow.

26:40.680 --> 26:42.720
Okay, one drink and I'm out of here.

26:53.600 --> 26:55.560
Has this happened before?

26:56.840 --> 26:59.440
Before I had hil transferred from Boston.

27:00.120 --> 27:03.760
No! No one at your facility ever
told me Glenn had a lung infection.

27:04.320 --> 27:06.080
I don't care how
common of a problem it is.

27:06.160 --> 27:08.320
I'm his legal guardian.
It would have made sense to call me

27:08.480 --> 27:10.400
and tell me about his condition.
No, I did not sign

27:10.440 --> 27:12.920
a do not resuscitate form.
No, you don't have to check his file.

27:13.040 --> 27:14.400
Just get me Dr. Bennett.

27:30.080 --> 27:31.560
- Doctor...
- Doctor...

27:35.920 --> 27:36.960
Bob!

27:37.280 --> 27:40.200
- Shit. For real?
- Hey Bob!

27:40.520 --> 27:42.840
I'm up. I'm up.
I'll be right there. Shirt!

27:44.520 --> 27:46.600
Yeah. No, no. I'm up.

27:46.800 --> 27:48.840
I'm up. Just...

27:51.560 --> 27:52.440
Oh...

27:52.840 --> 27:55.240
Oh. What are you doing here?

27:55.320 --> 27:57.720
- Can I come in?
- You're, uh... in.

27:58.320 --> 27:59.520
How did you find me?

27:59.560 --> 28:01.280
I looked through your stuff.
Hotel receipt.

28:02.000 --> 28:04.200
- What's going on?
- Uh. It's not mental.

28:04.400 --> 28:06.480
Are you... Has the doctor checked her out?

28:06.600 --> 28:08.200
No, no. listen... Billy. He's got it too.

28:08.360 --> 28:09.400
- Billy?
- Down in the tunnels.

28:09.480 --> 28:12.840
He doesn't do drugs or nothing.
And he's got it, like the exact same thing.

28:13.240 --> 28:15.480
Look, Owen, I don't know
what to tell you, man.

28:16.560 --> 28:18.720
You were wrong. You said
it was because she was crazy.

28:18.800 --> 28:20.120
No. I said she was...

28:20.320 --> 28:22.560
I said that her blood work

28:22.640 --> 28:25.880
didn't show any signs of infection and
that her vital signs were all--

28:26.000 --> 28:28.800
Look. The point is that you
can't catch craziness from someone else.

28:29.120 --> 28:31.240
I wouldn't be too sure about that.

28:32.280 --> 28:33.360
Hello.

28:33.920 --> 28:35.200
This is Jill. My...

28:35.480 --> 28:37.200
- ...associate.
- How do you do?

28:37.800 --> 28:38.720
Hi.

28:38.920 --> 28:40.640
- What's going on?
- Hmm.

28:41.560 --> 28:43.240
Can we just go see Billy?

28:49.080 --> 28:50.440
Morning, Bob.

28:51.080 --> 28:53.320
Hi Jill. What are you doing?

28:54.040 --> 28:56.360
- What's going on?
- That's a good question.

28:56.600 --> 28:58.040
Oh well, okay. I'll come back later.

28:58.280 --> 29:00.520
- No, Bob, what is it?
- It's okay.

29:00.640 --> 29:01.560
Come in, Bob.

29:01.800 --> 29:03.960
Come in. Come in.

29:06.920 --> 29:08.440
Could you please go get a cab?

29:08.560 --> 29:12.040
And could you please, go with her,
and I'll be right there, I promise.

29:12.240 --> 29:14.080
Yes. Let's do that.

29:14.320 --> 29:16.600
- Hi Bob. Bye David.
- Bye Jill.

29:20.600 --> 29:22.680
- What's going on, Bob?
- I'm meeting Heather.

29:22.960 --> 29:24.080
She's incredible.

29:24.120 --> 29:26.400
She's right there with me
on global warming.

29:26.720 --> 29:28.640
We're having breakfast.
I think we can work together.

29:28.760 --> 29:30.080
I'm nervous.

29:30.200 --> 29:31.480
You got a date!

29:31.720 --> 29:34.520
No, no, no.
That's okay, okay? Okay.

29:34.680 --> 29:37.160
Okay, so you want to just take
things nice and slowly.

29:37.400 --> 29:39.440
Right? You don't want her to know
you're coming on to her.

29:42.560 --> 29:44.640
But I am. Aren't I?

29:49.360 --> 29:51.600
You've got to relax, Bob.
You've got to relax.

29:51.800 --> 29:53.400
You want to call Caroline?

29:53.520 --> 29:55.040
- I already have.
- All right, well, look.

29:55.200 --> 29:56.800
You just asked her out
for breakfast.

29:56.920 --> 29:59.560
Just sit back and enjoy your meal together,
okay? See where it goes from there.

29:59.680 --> 30:00.880
Do you think she likes oatmeal?

30:00.960 --> 30:02.760
- Gimme a break, Bob.
- Here she is.

30:03.560 --> 30:06.840
Okay. Remember,
it's just like giving a talk, right?

30:07.000 --> 30:09.600
Confidence,
eye contact, humour.

30:10.640 --> 30:11.400
Ha, ha.

30:11.880 --> 30:13.480
You'll do just fine.

30:13.720 --> 30:15.240
I'll see you in a little bit. Okay?

30:19.400 --> 30:21.240
- Dr. Melnikov.
- Bob.

30:21.360 --> 30:23.560
- It's a pleasure. Heather Michelle.
- I know.

30:26.280 --> 30:27.640
Ha! Thank you.

30:28.520 --> 30:31.280
- I was very flattered by your note.
- Oh, likewise.

30:31.480 --> 30:33.560
I mean,
I was flattered by your talk.

30:33.640 --> 30:36.200
I mean,
not flattered, but impressed.

30:37.040 --> 30:38.400
Well, thank you.

30:38.560 --> 30:40.960
Yeah. You know,
I'm working on an inversion theory,

30:41.080 --> 30:43.200
and I think I heard something
in your presentation

30:43.320 --> 30:45.560
that is directly connected
to something in my work.

30:45.960 --> 30:47.840
Well, I'd love to hear it.

30:51.080 --> 30:52.360
Do you like oatmeal?

30:52.520 --> 30:53.760
It's my favorite.
// FIN PARTIE 2

31:12.800 --> 31:14.400
Could be neurological.

31:15.520 --> 31:17.640
Billy, do you get
a lot of mosquitoes down here?

31:18.960 --> 31:19.920
Shit.

31:21.160 --> 31:23.080
It's the same as Sunshine.

31:23.320 --> 31:26.080
- It started the same way.
- It's not West Nile. It's almost...

31:26.200 --> 31:29.120
...epileptic. We should get
some blood work done on him.

31:29.520 --> 31:31.320
Listen... It's the same as Sunshine started

31:31.360 --> 31:33.280
and it's not in the blood,
and it's not in the fucking brain.

31:33.440 --> 31:34.840
Hey Owen... Relax.

31:35.040 --> 31:36.480
We're here to help.

31:36.960 --> 31:39.840
- What's your chart saying?
- I don't see anything.

31:39.960 --> 31:42.960
Looks like they did all
the right tests. HIV. TB.

31:43.080 --> 31:45.360
Immunoglobulin
M and G antibodies.

31:45.600 --> 31:48.120
- Okay. So I went to brain damage.
- It makes sense.

31:48.320 --> 31:50.680
But this guy isn't
as bad off as the girl.

31:51.440 --> 31:55.200
- Owen, how long has Billy been down here?
- He's new. Couple of weeks.

31:55.400 --> 31:58.800
- And Sunshine?
- I don't know, a year. Why?

31:59.400 --> 32:01.120
Yeah, what are you thinking?

32:01.320 --> 32:02.560
Just thinking.

32:06.800 --> 32:09.000
We can put Billy and Sunshine
under a microscope.

32:09.360 --> 32:12.000
Check their DNA, see
if they got anything in common.

32:12.280 --> 32:14.920
40 year old male, 15 year
old female, that's a long shot.

32:15.040 --> 32:16.880
What else do you think
they might have in common?

32:17.040 --> 32:19.200
They both live in this shithole. Sorry.

32:20.680 --> 32:21.800
Environment.

32:21.880 --> 32:24.040
We going to need to
collect things, Owen, okay?

32:24.120 --> 32:27.160
Air, water, wall scrapings, rat shit,
whatever's down here we need a piece of it.

32:27.280 --> 32:28.640
- You got any baggies?
- Yeah.

32:28.720 --> 32:31.800
Okay. And Owen, I need blood and urine
samples from Billy to compare with Sunshine.

32:31.920 --> 32:33.280
- How are you going to take the blood?
- Oh, shit.

32:33.400 --> 32:35.040
- I can get a needle.
- A clean one?

32:35.160 --> 32:35.960
Yeah.

32:40.840 --> 32:42.640
- What?
- You're amazing.

32:42.760 --> 32:43.880
What?

32:44.040 --> 32:47.520
Look where we are, David.
This is the actual asshole of New York City.

32:47.680 --> 32:49.840
Yeah, I couldn't get
tickets to The Lion King, so...

32:51.760 --> 32:53.560
So where do we start?

32:54.200 --> 32:57.080
Hmm! Maybe with
something about last night?

32:58.040 --> 32:59.520
What is there to say?

33:00.440 --> 33:02.040
Uh... Something..

33:02.080 --> 33:03.560
- Okay, here's the thing...
- Right.

33:03.640 --> 33:08.080
When you came down to New York,
I never thought for a second but...

33:09.200 --> 33:10.840
I see you found the baggies.

33:11.000 --> 33:12.760
Let's get to work.

33:12.960 --> 33:15.160
- I'll get, ahem...
- I'll go this way.

33:16.120 --> 33:19.160
How does solar heating
in the haze affect the monsoon rainfall?

33:19.280 --> 33:22.320
How does the reduction
of solar energy to the surface

33:22.480 --> 33:24.240
- affect the water table?
- Right.

33:24.400 --> 33:26.880
Does the haze amplify or ameliorate

33:27.000 --> 33:28.960
the warming due to the greenhouse gases?

33:29.080 --> 33:30.760
What if we started a working group?

33:32.320 --> 33:33.320
You and me?

33:33.520 --> 33:36.120
Yeah. I'd love to come and see
this weather tank you're building.

33:36.320 --> 33:39.560
I mean, who knows, maybe there's a way
that I can use it in my work.

33:39.760 --> 33:41.720
If that's not too much
of an imposition.

33:42.920 --> 33:43.920
Not at all.

33:45.560 --> 33:48.360
I wish we would have met
at last year's conference.

33:49.320 --> 33:52.440
Ten years ago,
when global warming first surfaced

33:52.560 --> 33:54.400
to the Earth
as a threat to our environment.

33:54.440 --> 33:56.720
- We can't ignore the politics of this.
- Of course not.

33:56.760 --> 33:58.640
No, we've got to push for legislation,

33:58.720 --> 34:01.240
and get the fat cats to realize
that this problem is...

34:02.680 --> 34:05.600
Ha! Oh my... We're running late
for the morning sessions.

34:06.320 --> 34:08.320
The time just flew.

34:09.400 --> 34:12.120
Bob, this is the start of something.

34:12.880 --> 34:14.880
I know it, I feel it.

34:15.760 --> 34:18.120
That's the great thing
about these conferences, isn't it?

34:18.639 --> 34:19.719
What's that?

34:21.239 --> 34:23.239
We might never have met otherwise.

34:25.280 --> 34:26.480
Heather!

34:26.639 --> 34:27.760
Yeah?

34:28.560 --> 34:30.280
You'll be at my talk this afternoon?

34:30.800 --> 34:32.000
Are you kidding?

34:32.560 --> 34:34.440
I wouldn't miss it for the world!

34:54.239 --> 34:55.159
Boo!

34:57.440 --> 34:59.600
Scared the shit out of you,
didn't I?

35:17.640 --> 35:19.840
- How did you do?
- Well, we got a dead rat.

35:20.000 --> 35:21.960
Green slime and
some sulfuric water.

35:22.240 --> 35:24.120
- Ah.
- So what happens now?

35:24.280 --> 35:27.320
Well, now we take these and run them
through some very powerful,

35:27.440 --> 35:30.040
very expensive equipment
in a lab in Toronto.

35:30.560 --> 35:31.640
Gotcha.

35:32.560 --> 35:34.120
So what're you shooting?

35:34.640 --> 35:36.760
Me? Nothing.

35:37.240 --> 35:38.440
Where did you get the needle?

35:38.600 --> 35:40.840
See, I knew you were going
to front on me for that.

35:40.920 --> 35:42.720
- You gotta stop.
- I already have.

35:42.960 --> 35:44.760
Owen, what are you doing down here, man?

35:44.880 --> 35:47.520
Well, seeing as how I live here,
I guess it's home.

35:48.080 --> 35:51.720
You don't have any other place
you could go, like back home... home?

35:52.920 --> 35:54.520
North Platte, Nebraska?

35:55.040 --> 35:57.120
My dad drives a truck,
he's never home.

35:57.240 --> 36:00.600
And my mom's...
She's found the Lord... And so

36:00.760 --> 36:03.240
it's just better not being around.

36:04.640 --> 36:06.080
Does she know you're here?

36:06.200 --> 36:07.760
- She doesn't care.
- How do you know?

36:09.120 --> 36:12.480
Because every time I go to the bus station,

36:12.640 --> 36:15.680
I see the posters of
all the missing kids and runaways

36:15.800 --> 36:19.080
of parents who want to find them.
I look and I don't see me.

36:20.600 --> 36:24.000
See. She probably doesn't
even know I'm gone.

36:26.320 --> 36:28.560
So this is home... my home.

36:31.440 --> 36:32.920
You got a cell?

36:33.960 --> 36:35.440
Come on.

36:43.240 --> 36:44.400
That's my number.

36:44.640 --> 36:46.920
Call me in a week,
I'll let you know what we find.

36:47.600 --> 36:48.440
Or...

36:48.840 --> 36:50.600
You know...
if you need anything.

36:51.760 --> 36:53.520
But not collect!

36:54.040 --> 36:55.640
- Bye Owen.
- Bye.

37:07.200 --> 37:09.200
His EEG was almost flat?

37:09.360 --> 37:10.920
Oh, my God...

37:12.120 --> 37:14.440
Why wasn't I told, Doctor?

37:16.960 --> 37:17.920
Right.

37:18.960 --> 37:21.960
No. He's... he's doing fine.

37:22.440 --> 37:25.320
It sounds like the same trouble
he's had in the past. So...

37:25.680 --> 37:27.080
Yes. I will.

37:27.760 --> 37:29.240
Yes. Thank you.

37:32.680 --> 37:34.720
Hey. It's me. Uh...

37:35.520 --> 37:37.080
I'm, uh...

37:37.600 --> 37:39.720
Just... uh...
Call me when you can.

37:39.960 --> 37:41.000
Okay?

37:41.800 --> 37:42.720
Bye.

37:59.480 --> 38:00.520
Ah.

38:01.360 --> 38:02.720
You think he'll be okay?

38:02.960 --> 38:04.160
I don't know.

38:04.400 --> 38:07.640
Well... Where should I start
with this stuff?

38:08.120 --> 38:09.760
Have Carlos do the blood.

38:09.880 --> 38:11.640
Check everything
with Sunshine's file.

38:11.720 --> 38:13.880
Get Mayko on a computer
run for symptoms.

38:14.080 --> 38:18.040
See if she can find anything
even remotely close, and...

38:18.320 --> 38:20.400
You know the rest of the drill.

38:20.520 --> 38:21.560
Sure.

38:21.840 --> 38:22.960
Taxi!

38:28.560 --> 38:29.960
Nice.
- Thank you.

38:30.200 --> 38:31.440
- We'll talk.
- Okay.

38:31.480 --> 38:32.920
Talk. Fuck! Bob!

38:33.120 --> 38:34.960
What? Oh. Am I coming?

38:35.120 --> 38:35.920
Yes!

38:39.360 --> 38:41.120
Bob Melnikov.

39:01.760 --> 39:03.480
Good afte...

39:04.200 --> 39:05.680
Good afternoon.

39:06.040 --> 39:07.520
Thank you all for coming.

39:09.280 --> 39:11.040
I promise you an interesting talk

39:11.200 --> 39:13.320
even though it might be full of hot air.

39:17.960 --> 39:20.000
Well. So much for starting
off with a joke.

39:22.920 --> 39:26.040
60% of the world's
population lives in Asia.

39:32.440 --> 39:35.040
- Okay, so... Hang on a second.
- What are you doing?

39:35.240 --> 39:37.480
What? For the... No. Never mind.
Okay, we'll be back tonight.

39:37.600 --> 39:39.040
- Okay. Okay.
- Thanks, Jill.

39:42.600 --> 39:43.960
Over the past three decades

39:44.080 --> 39:46.720
large-scale economic developments
have transformed Asia,

39:46.880 --> 39:49.920
not only on the ground,
but in the skies as well.

40:01.440 --> 40:04.520
A large, brownish haze now covers
much of this part of the world,

40:04.760 --> 40:06.200
posing a threat not only to Asia

40:06.360 --> 40:08.760
and her people,
but to the entire planet.

40:09.160 --> 40:12.080
Thank you and
enjoy the rest of the conference.

40:25.680 --> 40:27.840
He works at my lab, you know.

40:29.640 --> 40:31.920
Bob, we are gonna send
you out on the road.

40:32.480 --> 40:33.760
Come on, David.

40:33.920 --> 40:35.480
Serious, you're gonna be a big star.

40:35.640 --> 40:37.640
- Heather, am I right?
- I can't deny it.

40:38.200 --> 40:39.800
Who needs another drink?

40:40.040 --> 40:42.080
Gentlemen, I would love to,
but I have dinner plans.

40:42.120 --> 40:43.560
- Ah!
- And a show.

40:43.640 --> 40:46.640
A show? What better show could
you possibly get than this one right here?

40:47.960 --> 40:49.440
It's tempting...

40:52.200 --> 40:54.080
- So, Heather...
- Yeah?

40:54.280 --> 40:56.240
When do you think
you'll be able to come and visit?

40:56.360 --> 40:57.880
- Well, just as soon as--
- Hi!

40:58.040 --> 40:59.680
Oh, hey. Cass Wilcott.

40:59.760 --> 41:01.960
- This is David Sandstrom.
- Sandstorm?

41:02.240 --> 41:03.280
Sure thing.

41:03.680 --> 41:05.280
- Oh you're Bob Melnikov.
- Hi!

41:05.560 --> 41:07.920
I loved your talk. So inspiring.

41:08.040 --> 41:09.200
Thanks.

41:10.680 --> 41:13.080
Well, what brings you
to the conference?

41:13.640 --> 41:14.480
Her.

41:15.480 --> 41:17.880
- Hum. Bob.
- I'm her partner.

41:18.200 --> 41:20.560
Oh! So you're working
on the global dimming project together?

41:20.760 --> 41:23.000
Ah! No. It's a common mistake.

41:23.280 --> 41:24.880
Cass is my partner...

41:25.280 --> 41:26.560
Partner.

41:32.240 --> 41:33.040
Oh!

41:33.920 --> 41:36.560
- Oh, Bob, I'll be in touch.
- Okay.

41:36.720 --> 41:38.840
- Nice to meet you.
- You've got my card, right?

41:39.240 --> 41:39.920
Right!

41:41.240 --> 41:42.240
Bye David!

41:42.680 --> 41:43.880
Heather.

41:46.600 --> 41:49.200
I can't believe I didn't notice.
I usually spot that shit right off.

41:49.360 --> 41:50.960
Oh, Bob. Hey, hey.

41:54.800 --> 41:56.680
I get you another drink.

42:05.160 --> 42:06.600
There's not much left to do.

42:06.760 --> 42:08.520
I wish there was, but...

42:08.720 --> 42:10.200
Not in here.

42:10.440 --> 42:12.840
- He can't hear us.
- You don't know that.

42:14.960 --> 42:17.760
It's not easy to see
our loved ones deteriorate, is it?

42:20.320 --> 42:23.440
My sister, his mother, wanted him to live.

42:24.320 --> 42:26.040
I'm all he has.

42:26.480 --> 42:27.920
Should he deteriorate further,

42:28.040 --> 42:30.400
would you like us to take
measures to sustain his life?

42:30.600 --> 42:32.920
Why do you people
keep asking me that?

42:33.120 --> 42:36.080
I'm sorry. It is your decision.

42:37.720 --> 42:38.880
You do understand

42:39.000 --> 42:40.760
that what we're doing
is not helping Glenn,

42:40.880 --> 42:42.720
it's just keeping him alive.

42:45.560 --> 42:47.080
I understand.

42:59.040 --> 43:01.320
I don't know what to do, Glenn.

43:05.160 --> 43:07.080
I'm sorry, Glenn.

43:31.920 --> 43:32.640
What?

43:32.960 --> 43:34.600
- Hey man.
- Owen?

43:34.760 --> 43:36.520
- Yup.
- What's the matter?

43:37.440 --> 43:38.600
She's gone.

43:38.800 --> 43:39.960
What?

43:40.440 --> 43:42.880
I don't know,
she got better and she went home.

43:42.920 --> 43:44.440
What do you mean,
she got better?

43:44.480 --> 43:46.440
What don't you get, man?
She got better.

43:46.600 --> 43:48.400
Why? What did the hospital say?

43:49.800 --> 43:53.160
Who knows?
All I know is that she's gone.

43:54.800 --> 43:57.080
Hmm. That's all, man!

43:57.240 --> 43:58.240
Peace.

43:59.520 --> 44:00.840
<i>Owen, are you still there?</i>

44:01.720 --> 44:03.920
<i>Look, man, I know your
life's been fucked up,</i>

44:04.080 --> 44:06.240
<i>but it's been fucked up
by other people.</i>

44:10.320 --> 44:11.360
<i>Owen?</i>

44:12.400 --> 44:13.720
<i>Owen?</i>

44:18.240 --> 44:19.400
<i>Owen?</i>

44:21.320 --> 44:22.640
<i>Next Time on ReGenesis:</i>

44:22.720 --> 44:24.200
Is the soul a part of our DNA,

44:24.280 --> 44:26.760
or is it an artifact of sperm
meeting the egg during sexual--

44:26.880 --> 44:29.400
Wes, you've got to get her out of here
before the... Oh, shit.

44:29.440 --> 44:31.280
Since when do the bozos in
Washington dictate

44:31.320 --> 44:32.800
the terms of our stem cell research?

44:32.880 --> 44:36.560
They're dictating the terms of employment
of American paid researchers like Jill.

44:36.680 --> 44:39.760
We're talking about a potential
treatment for juvenile diabetes, okay?

44:39.840 --> 44:41.840
- Tens of thousands of lives...
- Oh, shit!

44:43.520 --> 44:45.840
Nitrogen, potassium, and phosphates.

44:45.880 --> 44:48.080
- The three components of fertilizers.
- Uh-huh!

44:48.160 --> 44:49.400
Why would there be a farm in the subway?

44:49.480 --> 44:51.200
Why would someone want to
grow something in the subway?

44:51.280 --> 44:54.480
Because you wouldn't want anyone
to know what you were growing.

44:54.600 --> 44:57.000
So we're going to go
for a jog in Central Park.

44:57.360 --> 45:00.760
We're heading uphill now, and
just when we're about to get to the top,

45:00.920 --> 45:03.240
we can almost
see the Waldorf Plaza.

45:03.560 --> 45:06.000
It's snowing really lightly.
When I talk to Glenn,

45:06.360 --> 45:07.960
I can feel him listening.

45:08.760 --> 45:10.120
Oh, hey Dad.

45:10.200 --> 45:11.760
She's not here anymore, David.

45:11.800 --> 45:13.160
What do you mean?

45:14.960 --> 45:16.800
<i>Your mother... </i>

45:21.560 --> 45:23.360
We've got samples from the New York subway,

45:23.440 --> 45:25.840
but I'm starting to think
we may need to look wider.

45:25.960 --> 45:28.520
I'll send more information
to all the Norbac field agents online.

45:28.560 --> 45:30.880
Remember, only you know the whole story.
