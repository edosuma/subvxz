00:39.958 --> 00:41.796
"Aqua Teen Hunger Force."

00:41.829 --> 00:44.002
Number one in the 'hood, g.

00:44.035 --> 00:44.703
[burp]

00:44.736 --> 00:46.207
Next week on "Bruno Sardine,

00:46.240 --> 00:47.979
Private Inbreastigator"...

00:48.012 --> 00:51.052
Oh, baby, you were stung

00:51.087 --> 00:52.155
by a bee.

00:52.189 --> 00:54.796
I know, and it hurts.

00:54.829 --> 00:56.867
Oh, no, Bruno.

00:56.901 --> 00:57.870
Oh, my!

00:57.904 --> 01:00.009
My top magically came off.

01:00.042 --> 01:01.152
That's next week on

01:01.185 --> 01:02.756
"Bruno Sardine, Private

01:02.789 --> 01:04.060
Inbreastigator."

01:04.093 --> 01:05.429
Shut that crap off.

01:05.462 --> 01:06.799
But this is Bruno Sardine.

01:06.833 --> 01:08.437
I know who it is, Shake--

01:08.471 --> 01:09.840
the porno detective who keeps

01:09.873 --> 01:10.977
hurting himself so he can

01:11.010 --> 01:11.812
get laid.

01:11.845 --> 01:13.483
Here, cut me in half, quick!

01:13.517 --> 01:14.251
No, Shake.

01:14.286 --> 01:14.987
But her top came off,

01:15.020 --> 01:16.023
magically!

01:16.056 --> 01:17.025
What are those things?

01:17.059 --> 01:17.861
I want to get some.

01:17.895 --> 01:18.897
It's just tv, ok?

01:18.930 --> 01:20.000
Tv!

01:20.033 --> 01:21.336
Look, I am perfectly aware of

01:21.369 --> 01:23.041
the difference between the tv

01:23.074 --> 01:24.311
and the flesh world we live in,

01:24.344 --> 01:26.149
like from "videodrome," right?

01:26.182 --> 01:27.084
You seen it?

01:27.118 --> 01:28.522
Frylock, what is it to loathe

01:28.555 --> 01:29.758
someone?

01:29.791 --> 01:31.194
It's got blondie. Ha!

01:31.229 --> 01:32.364
Let me tell you where she ain't

01:32.398 --> 01:33.434
a blonde.

01:33.467 --> 01:34.169
Go to bed!

01:34.202 --> 01:35.071
[door slams]

01:35.104 --> 01:36.207
I will!

01:36.241 --> 01:37.711
With women.

01:37.745 --> 01:39.683
? 2, 3, uh, yeah

01:39.716 --> 01:41.220
Shake to the beat ?

01:41.254 --> 01:42.323
Shake.

01:42.357 --> 01:44.228
Shake, what--what the hell?

01:44.262 --> 01:47.235
[heavy metal music blaring]

01:47.269 --> 01:49.007
Yo, Shake!

01:49.040 --> 01:53.418
[music continuing]

01:53.451 --> 01:54.353
[microphone feedback]

01:54.387 --> 01:55.290
[music stops]

01:55.323 --> 01:56.258
Help!

01:56.292 --> 01:57.361
Is that you, Frylock?

01:57.395 --> 01:58.464
When did we get a well?

01:58.498 --> 01:59.233
What are you doing

01:59.266 --> 02:00.035
down there?

02:00.068 --> 02:00.770
I was just going to fetch

02:00.804 --> 02:01.947
water for the village, and I

02:01.980 --> 02:02.982
must have slipped.

02:03.015 --> 02:03.985
I blacked out.

02:04.018 --> 02:05.890
Where's the women?

02:05.923 --> 02:06.759
Where did this well

02:06.792 --> 02:07.494
come from?

02:07.527 --> 02:08.997
Hey, Frylock, where the hell

02:09.031 --> 02:10.501
did we get this well?

02:10.533 --> 02:11.270
Meatwad, you watch

02:11.303 --> 02:11.905
your mouth.

02:11.938 --> 02:12.607
Heh heh heh!

02:12.640 --> 02:13.409
Come on.

02:13.442 --> 02:14.545
The old abandoned well?

02:14.579 --> 02:17.352
Read the press release!

02:17.386 --> 02:19.524
"Man falls down old abandoned

02:19.557 --> 02:20.326
well--"

02:20.359 --> 02:21.195
Hey, Frylock.

02:21.229 --> 02:22.331
Ass.

02:22.364 --> 02:23.100
Meatwad!

02:23.133 --> 02:23.935
There's only a limited number

02:23.968 --> 02:25.071
of those, so, you know, put it

02:25.105 --> 02:26.041
back when you're done.

02:26.074 --> 02:26.876
Oh, I am done.

02:26.910 --> 02:28.113
[distant beeping]

02:28.146 --> 02:29.617
And so is my dinner.

02:29.650 --> 02:30.452
[sniffing]

02:30.485 --> 02:31.488
Something smells like chili.

02:31.522 --> 02:33.226
He's right.

02:33.259 --> 02:34.161
For the first time in his

02:34.194 --> 02:35.765
mealy, friggin' little life.

02:35.799 --> 02:37.302
Turns out there's an old

02:37.336 --> 02:38.773
abandoned microwave where I got

02:38.806 --> 02:41.246
stuck, with chili and food,

02:41.279 --> 02:43.518
couple magazines.

02:43.552 --> 02:45.156
So call channel 5, get them

02:45.189 --> 02:46.426
broads over here, and tell them

02:46.460 --> 02:47.595
about the tragedy of my

02:47.629 --> 02:48.498
trappedness.

02:48.531 --> 02:49.634
Work into it, though.

02:49.668 --> 02:50.603
Build it up.

02:50.636 --> 02:51.873
Hot women--

02:51.906 --> 02:53.143
Turn this ass monkey on,

02:53.177 --> 02:54.079
full blast.

02:54.112 --> 02:54.981
Will you quit saying, "ass"?!

02:55.014 --> 02:56.150
I just assed you to do

02:56.184 --> 02:56.986
something for me.

02:57.019 --> 02:57.754
Meatwad, you watch

02:57.788 --> 02:58.423
your mouth.

02:58.456 --> 03:00.929
I said "ask"...Blasthole.

03:00.962 --> 03:02.607
Ha ha ha ha!

03:02.641 --> 03:04.411
Oh, weezie, you're a card!

03:04.445 --> 03:05.715
You hear that?

03:05.749 --> 03:06.817
Florence, will you ever get

03:06.851 --> 03:07.720
that door?

03:07.754 --> 03:09.023
That's "The Jeffersons."

03:09.057 --> 03:10.160
I want to go get trapped where

03:10.193 --> 03:10.995
he does.

03:11.028 --> 03:11.797
No, Meatwad.

03:11.830 --> 03:13.735
Nobody's getting trapped, ok?

03:13.769 --> 03:15.105
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa!

03:15.138 --> 03:16.041
What are you doing?

03:16.075 --> 03:19.015
I am in a race against time down

03:19.048 --> 03:21.154
there with a shattered leg and--

03:21.188 --> 03:22.257
does this look shattered?

03:22.291 --> 03:23.560
It's got to look shattered.

03:23.594 --> 03:24.963
Hey, go back down there, or

03:24.997 --> 03:27.069
I'm gonna dump this soup on you.

03:27.103 --> 03:28.038
Wait, whoa.

03:28.071 --> 03:29.475
I'm getting crossed sig--ow!

03:29.509 --> 03:31.547
Oh, I didn't!

03:31.580 --> 03:33.519
Remove the chain,

03:33.552 --> 03:35.089
'cause that's off it.

03:35.123 --> 03:36.159
That was a good one.

03:36.192 --> 03:38.698
So, uh, what else you earth

03:38.732 --> 03:41.472
dwellers doing up here, on the

03:41.505 --> 03:42.542
surface?

03:42.575 --> 03:44.313
Livin' large, boy.

03:44.347 --> 03:46.352
Livin' so large.

03:46.385 --> 03:48.222
Just gonna have dinner.

03:48.257 --> 03:50.262
But, since, you know, it's on

03:50.295 --> 03:51.698
your face and all--oh!

03:51.731 --> 03:53.603
I did not!

03:53.636 --> 03:56.277
Hey, we could heat this up in

03:56.310 --> 03:58.215
ye old abandoned microwave.

03:58.248 --> 03:59.686
I could use some help wiring the

03:59.719 --> 04:01.089
old abandoned surround-sound

04:01.122 --> 04:02.132
system.

04:02.165 --> 04:04.738
I got the old abandoned bad boys

04:04.771 --> 04:05.907
box set.

04:05.941 --> 04:07.044
Huh?

04:07.077 --> 04:08.381
Huh?

04:08.414 --> 04:09.250
What about water, Shake?

04:09.283 --> 04:10.619
Any water in that well?

04:10.653 --> 04:11.689
Bottled.

04:11.722 --> 04:13.494
Oh, yeah, and, uh, the old

04:13.527 --> 04:15.098
abandoned hot tub.

04:15.131 --> 04:15.933
Hot tub?

04:15.967 --> 04:16.635
Damn.

04:16.668 --> 04:18.005
What else you got down there?

04:18.038 --> 04:20.244
Tons and tons of rubbers.

04:20.278 --> 04:21.581
Come on, I'll show you.

04:21.613 --> 04:23.018
What, do I just sort of

04:23.051 --> 04:24.254
fall down in there?

04:24.288 --> 04:25.591
Yeah, we fall into the old

04:25.624 --> 04:26.760
abandoned well, right?

04:26.794 --> 04:28.098
Ha ha ha!

04:28.131 --> 04:29.166
Come on.

04:29.201 --> 04:30.938
We take the elevator.

04:30.971 --> 04:36.452
[elevator humming]

04:36.485 --> 04:39.593
Friggin' thing takes forever.

04:39.626 --> 04:40.863
So what's going on?

04:40.896 --> 04:42.567
Anything?

04:42.601 --> 04:43.737
Livin' large--

04:43.771 --> 04:46.043
You--you take the handicapped

04:46.076 --> 04:49.986
rail because you...Handicapped!

04:50.019 --> 04:51.557
Men--uh, mentally.

04:51.590 --> 04:52.726
Heh heh, yeah.

04:52.760 --> 04:54.097
You a sissy.

04:54.130 --> 04:55.099
You're the sissy, you

04:55.132 --> 04:56.670
stupid--would a sissy have

04:56.703 --> 04:58.174
rubbers lining every inch of his

04:58.207 --> 04:59.076
house?!

04:59.109 --> 04:59.945
Just calm down and get your

04:59.979 --> 05:00.847
ass in here!

05:00.881 --> 05:02.391
What floor, all of them?

05:02.425 --> 05:04.731
Ha ha ha ha!

05:04.764 --> 05:12.884
[distorted laughing]

05:12.918 --> 05:14.522
Oh, come on!

05:14.556 --> 05:15.659
Off the chain.

05:15.692 --> 05:16.928
See?

05:16.962 --> 05:17.830
I fooled ya.

05:17.864 --> 05:18.766
Ha ha ha ha!

05:18.799 --> 05:20.070
There's only one floor.

05:20.103 --> 05:21.874
So, what do you think?

05:21.907 --> 05:23.645
I got to make it like my hand is

05:23.679 --> 05:25.349
trapped in the old abandoned

05:25.383 --> 05:26.386
ice maker?

05:26.419 --> 05:27.321
You like this?

05:27.354 --> 05:28.725
Brushed metal.

05:28.758 --> 05:29.694
[groaning]

05:29.727 --> 05:31.031
Hey, who's this old boy?

05:31.064 --> 05:32.868
Oh, that's my roommate.

05:32.902 --> 05:34.740
More like doommate.

05:34.773 --> 05:35.709
Wait a minute.

05:35.743 --> 05:37.414
That's the legendary dirt

05:37.447 --> 05:38.850
monster, Dirtfoot!

05:38.884 --> 05:40.187
Shh, don't even look at him.

05:40.221 --> 05:41.691
No, for real?

05:41.725 --> 05:42.861
The Dirtfoot?

05:42.894 --> 05:43.595
Yeah.

05:43.630 --> 05:44.598
Hey, it was real nice of you not

05:44.632 --> 05:46.002
to rinse your bowls off in the

05:46.036 --> 05:47.305
sink, Dirtfoot!

05:47.339 --> 05:49.477
That's real legendary of you.

05:49.510 --> 05:50.647
I always thought Dirtfoot was

05:50.680 --> 05:51.583
just a hoax.

05:51.616 --> 05:52.385
Me, too.

05:52.418 --> 05:53.588
Oh, no, he is real.

05:53.621 --> 05:54.623
No, he's very real.

05:54.658 --> 05:55.526
And he likes to leave his

05:55.560 --> 05:58.166
very real giant sock draped over

05:58.200 --> 05:59.736
the couch like it was a friggin'

05:59.771 --> 06:02.383
afghan so that others can enjoy

06:02.417 --> 06:04.455
the very real odor of his

06:04.489 --> 06:06.694
2,000-year-old foot sweat!

06:06.728 --> 06:08.265
[growling]

06:08.298 --> 06:09.201
You do realize that this is

06:09.235 --> 06:10.638
your media story, don't you?

06:10.671 --> 06:11.674
I'm not giving it to him!

06:11.707 --> 06:12.910
It's about me!

06:12.944 --> 06:15.717
I'm about me, and women!

06:15.751 --> 06:16.754
[growling]

06:16.787 --> 06:18.057
Let's go, like, over here.

06:18.090 --> 06:19.226
This guy's been driving me

06:19.260 --> 06:20.095
ape-[burp].

06:20.128 --> 06:21.031
Well, why don't you just

06:21.065 --> 06:21.867
evict him?

06:21.900 --> 06:22.769
It's your well.

06:22.802 --> 06:23.671
Shh, shut up, man.

06:23.704 --> 06:26.579
Um...Because he hurts me.

06:26.612 --> 06:27.748
You know, I always heard that

06:27.782 --> 06:29.953
Dirtfoot was kind of...

06:29.987 --> 06:30.890
Here we go.

06:30.923 --> 06:32.426
What, Meatwad, what?

06:32.460 --> 06:33.296
Well, you know, I mean,

06:33.329 --> 06:35.567
legend has it that he's kind of

06:35.602 --> 06:36.404
an [burp]-hole.

06:36.437 --> 06:37.439
You see?!

06:37.472 --> 06:38.810
I'm not the only one that--

06:38.843 --> 06:39.778
oh, no!

06:39.812 --> 06:41.015
Ok.

06:41.048 --> 06:42.251
It wouldn't be as bad, except

06:42.285 --> 06:43.956
he keeps kicking in exactly

06:43.989 --> 06:44.991
the same spot.

06:45.025 --> 06:46.262
All right, Shake, well,

06:46.295 --> 06:47.164
I've seen him.

06:47.197 --> 06:48.099
We're going back now.

06:48.133 --> 06:48.901
All right, well, look, just

06:48.935 --> 06:50.673
please call the media.

06:50.706 --> 06:52.745
I got no reception down here--

06:52.778 --> 06:55.084
ah! What did I do?

06:55.117 --> 06:56.989
Tonight, on "Inappropriate

06:57.022 --> 06:59.061
Mysteries of the Jersey Shore,"

06:59.094 --> 07:01.473
the immortal legend of Dirtfoot.

07:01.507 --> 07:03.111
Oh, change it.

07:03.145 --> 07:06.653
[roaring]

07:06.686 --> 07:08.024
Change it, change it,

07:08.057 --> 07:10.195
change--burp--change it!

07:10.229 --> 07:12.702
Oh, now you're blocking it!

07:12.736 --> 07:14.841
Dirtfoot has long been known

07:14.874 --> 07:16.546
to be rude, but the biggest

07:16.579 --> 07:18.551
secret of Dirtfoot is that many

07:18.584 --> 07:20.990
witnesses claim him to be gay.

07:21.023 --> 07:23.529
Whoa!

07:23.563 --> 07:25.802
A little light in the loafer!

07:25.835 --> 07:27.373
The only known photo of him

07:27.406 --> 07:31.584
is at this gay pride parade.

07:31.617 --> 07:33.088
He's totally gay.

07:33.121 --> 07:34.658
Hey, don't look at me.

07:34.692 --> 07:35.760
I don't have the same problem

07:35.794 --> 07:37.031
that jesus has with it.

07:37.064 --> 07:38.166
I don't hate you people.

07:38.201 --> 07:39.737
We're cool, as long as you don't

07:39.771 --> 07:41.141
try to convert me, and I'm

07:41.174 --> 07:42.444
locking my bedroom door from now

07:42.477 --> 07:43.514
on, I can tell you that.

07:43.547 --> 07:47.257
Holy--whoa!

07:47.290 --> 07:48.292
[deadpan]

07:48.326 --> 07:49.329
Oh, it's you.

07:49.362 --> 07:50.799
Thank God you're alive, but how?

07:50.833 --> 07:51.701
Shut up!

07:51.735 --> 07:52.871
I got problems, all right?

07:52.904 --> 07:54.508
I'm supposed to be getting some,

07:54.542 --> 07:56.279
big-time, on account of my

07:56.313 --> 07:58.819
tragedy, but now everyone thinks

07:58.853 --> 07:59.856
I'm gay.

07:59.889 --> 08:00.758
Who's everyone?

08:00.791 --> 08:01.934
Oh, [burp] harlem

08:01.967 --> 08:03.471
globetrotters, for one.

08:03.505 --> 08:05.175
Curly, meadowlark.

08:05.209 --> 08:06.713
That's why they haven't called.

08:06.746 --> 08:07.882
No one thinks you're gay,

08:07.916 --> 08:08.751
Shake.

08:08.784 --> 08:09.754
Look, it takes time and hard

08:09.787 --> 08:10.856
work to become gay.

08:10.890 --> 08:12.060
I mean, you need another person

08:12.093 --> 08:13.931
to influence your weak emotions.

08:13.964 --> 08:15.235
You know Dirtfoot, down in

08:15.268 --> 08:16.203
the well?

08:16.237 --> 08:19.879
Hold on.

08:19.912 --> 08:21.817
Ok, he loves dudes.

08:21.851 --> 08:24.258
I so busted him cutting pictures

08:24.291 --> 08:26.095
of a jeep out of a magazine.

08:26.128 --> 08:27.766
Then, yesterday, he drew my bath

08:27.800 --> 08:29.604
water, and he gave me that look

08:29.637 --> 08:31.843
like, "Hey, I wear running

08:31.877 --> 08:32.980
shorts."

08:33.013 --> 08:34.349
It's ok, Shake, 'cause

08:34.383 --> 08:36.722
whoever you decide that you are,

08:36.755 --> 08:38.794
I'm still gonna love you...

08:38.828 --> 08:41.333
But just not in a gay way 'cause

08:41.366 --> 08:43.573
God makes all people different

08:43.607 --> 08:46.079
sizes and shapes and problems,

08:46.113 --> 08:47.850
but he only makes the people

08:47.884 --> 08:49.087
he hate gay.

08:49.121 --> 08:49.889
That's you.

08:49.923 --> 08:50.691
You it, boy.

08:50.725 --> 08:51.392
You gay.

08:51.427 --> 08:52.094
No, I'm not!

08:52.128 --> 08:52.830
You don't know me!

08:52.863 --> 08:53.765
Hey, Frylock, what is gay?

08:53.799 --> 08:54.635
What does that mean?

08:54.668 --> 08:55.437
Look, Shake, just because you

08:55.470 --> 08:56.372
don't want to admit you like

08:56.405 --> 08:57.675
living with a gay person doesn't

08:57.708 --> 08:59.212
mean you can't legally marry in

08:59.246 --> 09:00.014
the church.

09:00.048 --> 09:00.884
I know.

09:00.917 --> 09:02.160
Wait.

09:02.194 --> 09:03.430
Look, the right thing to do

09:03.463 --> 09:04.967
is to accept him for his

09:05.001 --> 09:06.939
difference, or you could just

09:06.972 --> 09:08.576
cut his head off, hide the body

09:08.610 --> 09:09.579
in the desert.

09:09.613 --> 09:10.849
That'd be different.

09:10.882 --> 09:11.651
Meatwad!

09:11.684 --> 09:12.620
Someone's been off the chain

09:12.653 --> 09:13.455
again.

09:13.489 --> 09:14.726
Look, just call channel 5,

09:14.759 --> 09:16.296
get some women over here.

09:16.330 --> 09:19.203
Uh, my hand's stuck in...

09:19.237 --> 09:20.473
The mailbox.

09:20.506 --> 09:21.342
All right.

09:21.376 --> 09:22.245
Let's do this thing.

09:22.278 --> 09:23.047
Go.

09:23.080 --> 09:24.316
Help!

09:24.350 --> 09:26.556
My hand is stuck in the mailbox!

09:26.589 --> 09:28.962
I need help, assistance!

09:28.995 --> 09:30.900
[groaning]

09:30.933 --> 09:32.805
Oh, not you!

09:32.838 --> 09:34.376
Oh, this looks so bad.

09:34.409 --> 09:35.511
Oh, yeah, they've been pretty

09:35.545 --> 09:37.149
much common-law married for

09:37.183 --> 09:38.286
years.

09:38.319 --> 09:39.188
It's cool.

09:39.221 --> 09:39.990
I don't have a problem

09:40.023 --> 09:40.792
with that.

09:40.825 --> 09:41.627
I'm fine with it.

09:41.660 --> 09:42.596
I don't think it's, you know,

09:42.630 --> 09:44.334
constitutional, but, you know,

09:44.367 --> 09:45.838
they do whatever they want, as

09:45.871 --> 09:46.873
long as they ain't flaunting it

09:46.907 --> 09:47.910
out in my yard or nothing

09:47.943 --> 09:50.349
'cause, you know, I'm a man.

09:50.382 --> 09:51.585
[distant shouting]

09:51.619 --> 09:52.622
Oh, oh, wait, wait.

09:52.655 --> 09:54.760
There they are.

09:54.793 --> 09:56.131
They're the gay ones.

09:56.164 --> 09:57.166
No pictures!

09:57.200 --> 09:59.239
Hey, where's my money here?

09:59.272 --> 10:00.442
...Seen here taking his lover

10:00.475 --> 10:01.578
in his arms.

10:01.611 --> 10:03.222
You don't have to be gay to like

10:03.255 --> 10:04.558
Dirtfoot, you just have to be

10:04.592 --> 10:06.363
gay to be Dirtfoot.

10:06.397 --> 10:08.001
Or, to be Dirtfoot, you have to

10:08.034 --> 10:08.903
be gay.

10:08.936 --> 10:09.738
Oh!

10:09.771 --> 10:10.641
I guess what we're saying

10:10.674 --> 10:11.877
here at channel 5 is Dirtfoot is

10:11.911 --> 10:14.483
gay, and so is that milkShake.

10:14.518 --> 10:15.320
Wow.

10:15.353 --> 10:16.623
This sucks.

10:16.656 --> 10:18.360
It's ok, Shake.

10:18.393 --> 10:19.831
We know you're not gay.

10:19.864 --> 10:21.301
Thank you, Frylock.

10:21.335 --> 10:22.270
So we got you a little going

10:22.303 --> 10:23.072
away present.

10:23.105 --> 10:24.777
Going away?

10:24.810 --> 10:25.746
You know we ain't living with

10:25.779 --> 10:27.015
no jay person.

10:27.049 --> 10:28.386
Is it--is it "jay"?

10:28.419 --> 10:29.890
Oh, gay, gay.

10:29.923 --> 10:30.725
Sorry.

10:30.759 --> 10:31.661
We ain't livin' with no gay

10:31.694 --> 10:32.429
dude.

10:32.463 --> 10:33.265
Come on, man.

10:33.298 --> 10:34.735
Well, what's the present?

10:34.769 --> 10:35.604
You've learned a valuable

10:35.637 --> 10:36.975
lesson in tolerance.

10:37.008 --> 10:37.943
Great.

10:37.977 --> 10:39.180
So what you're saying is,

10:39.213 --> 10:40.850
no present whatsoever.

10:40.884 --> 10:41.853
[knock on door]

10:41.887 --> 10:42.689
You haven't learned anything

10:42.722 --> 10:43.457
at all from this experience,

10:43.491 --> 10:44.393
have you?

10:44.426 --> 10:45.195
Sir--

10:45.229 --> 10:46.098
Hey, baby!

10:46.131 --> 10:47.166
I'm so sorry.

10:47.201 --> 10:48.805
I think I hit your dog...

10:48.838 --> 10:49.640
Check this out.

10:49.673 --> 10:50.475
Uh-oh.

10:50.509 --> 10:51.678
With my swords.

10:51.712 --> 10:53.216
Uh, that's not a dog.

10:53.249 --> 10:53.918
I'm straight!

10:53.951 --> 10:58.996
Look at me!

10:59.031 --> 11:00.066
Oh, no.

11:00.099 --> 11:01.703
My top just came off.

11:01.737 --> 11:03.114
Well, will you look at that!

11:03.147 --> 11:03.916
Ah ah ah!

11:03.949 --> 11:04.751
Don't look, Meatwad.

11:04.785 --> 11:05.620
Well, will you let me look

11:05.653 --> 11:06.222
at those?

11:06.255 --> 11:07.024
No.

11:07.057 --> 11:07.859
Oh, dear.

11:07.893 --> 11:08.996
I'll look.

11:09.029 --> 11:09.831
Yeah, uh

11:09.864 --> 11:10.834
people treat dirt

11:10.867 --> 11:11.936
like dirt the star

11:11.969 --> 11:13.139
because they got plenty money

11:13.173 --> 11:14.342
cocaine in the car

11:14.376 --> 11:15.512
got a big old [burp]

11:15.546 --> 11:16.982
about 6 feet tall

11:17.016 --> 11:18.019
and he [burp] more bitch

11:18.052 --> 11:19.322
than the movie stars

11:19.355 --> 11:21.360
uh, uh, yeah

11:21.393 --> 11:22.797
dirt like dirt

11:22.831 --> 11:23.967

11:24.000 --> 11:25.303
Oh, yeah
