WEBVTT

01:37.139 --> 01:38.975
Uh, hi, Blade.

01:39.600 --> 01:41.394
Billy something, right?

01:41.477 --> 01:44.313
Willie. Willie Watt.
I'm in your robotics class.

01:44.522 --> 01:48.359
Ugh. Biogenic interfacing.
I'll never get it.

01:48.442 --> 01:51.028
Well, maybe I can help.
Like, tutor you or something.

01:52.697 --> 01:54.657
- Tutor me?
- Yeah. I'm the...

02:03.666 --> 02:05.918
Hey, Blade. Schway outfit.

02:06.002 --> 02:08.254
It'd go great with my car.

02:08.337 --> 02:10.381
- Don't you think?
- It might.

02:10.589 --> 02:12.591
Blade, about
that tutoring thing.

02:12.675 --> 02:14.319
Tutoring? Does this mean
you're gonna start

02:14.343 --> 02:15.594
doing homework now, too?

02:15.678 --> 02:18.014
- I never said that.
- Good.

02:18.097 --> 02:20.891
- Then let's go for a ride.
- Right now? Just like that?

02:20.975 --> 02:23.853
- I'm a spur of the moment guy.
- But I like a little warning.

02:26.105 --> 02:27.815
Okay, then. Saturday night.

02:27.898 --> 02:28.983
The dance at the pier.

02:30.693 --> 02:32.528
I'll think about it.

02:32.903 --> 02:34.322
But I might have
other commitments.

02:34.405 --> 02:35.489
How about a ride home?

02:35.573 --> 02:37.616
She said she didn't want a ride.

02:37.700 --> 02:39.035
Wasn't talking to you, twit.

02:42.997 --> 02:45.166
Now look what you did.
You almost scratched it.

02:47.084 --> 02:48.419
Lay of him, Nash.

02:48.502 --> 02:49.855
Don't you have
anything better to do?

02:49.879 --> 02:51.589
You think, I'm afraid
of you, McGinnis?

02:51.672 --> 02:54.008
I don't know. Are you?

02:56.427 --> 02:57.803
He's not worth it.

03:00.848 --> 03:03.434
But you are, McGinnis. Someday.

03:12.234 --> 03:13.736
You okay?

03:25.581 --> 03:27.750
Move those sluice beams
to the first storey.

03:27.833 --> 03:30.586
And watch your port!
Keep that Golem steady!

03:30.669 --> 03:33.339
- You hear me?
- I copy, Frank. I copy.

03:40.763 --> 03:42.723
Yeah, that's it.
Keep her steady.

03:46.435 --> 03:48.604
So what are you gonna do
to the guy who did that?

03:51.857 --> 03:53.692
No wonder
they walk all over you.

03:53.776 --> 03:57.405
I told you, Willie,
someone pushes, you push back.

03:57.488 --> 03:59.115
Yeah, like that'll work.

04:00.616 --> 04:02.785
You listen to me.
I'm not raising no wuss.

04:04.995 --> 04:06.664
Will you keep it straight?

04:09.208 --> 04:10.918
I want you to take care
of this, Willie.

04:11.001 --> 04:12.169
You hear?

04:13.045 --> 04:15.798
- How am I supposed to do that?
- Hit him where it hurts!

04:17.174 --> 04:18.676
You figure it out.

04:34.275 --> 04:36.277
This camouflage option really soars.

04:36.485 --> 04:37.820
<i>No one's noticed you yet?</i>

04:37.903 --> 04:40.906
No one. Whoa!

04:42.658 --> 04:44.660
Just when the game
was getting good.

04:57.715 --> 04:59.758
I'm telling you,
the Golem was right there

04:59.842 --> 05:01.427
before I took my break.

05:01.510 --> 05:03.429
- Golem?
- Galvanic lifter machine.

05:03.512 --> 05:04.889
GLM. Golem.

05:04.972 --> 05:07.558
It's a robot,
two stories tall, 13 tons,

05:07.641 --> 05:08.976
and this jerk loses it!

05:09.059 --> 05:11.312
Hey! Hey!
That's enough of that!

05:11.395 --> 05:13.397
If this Golem thing
is as big as you say,

05:13.481 --> 05:15.024
they couldn't have taken it too far.

05:23.699 --> 05:26.827
I'm sick of the mall.
How about a ride?

05:27.203 --> 05:28.871
You like that car more than me.

05:28.996 --> 05:30.498
Who's talking about cars?

05:38.631 --> 05:39.924
{933931

05:49.808 --> 05:51.352
Jeez!

06:00.861 --> 06:02.029
Wait!

06:27.763 --> 06:29.431
Hit him where it hurts.

06:36.146 --> 06:38.065
No, not the car!

07:17.813 --> 07:19.732
Leave us alone!

08:01.065 --> 08:02.900
Gotcha now, stupid little bat.

08:27.675 --> 08:29.593
My hero.

09:00.374 --> 09:04.169
The Golem's control halo was
found on the rooftop. Fused.

09:04.253 --> 09:06.173
Any chance they found the head
that went with it?

09:06.255 --> 09:07.715
No such luck.

09:10.467 --> 09:12.094
The Golem went straight for that car.

09:12.177 --> 09:14.972
Belongs to Nelson Nash.
He goes to Hill High.

09:15.055 --> 09:16.783
Know anyone who might
have a grudge against him?

09:16.807 --> 09:20.185
The line starts with me and goes
around the block. Twice.

09:20.978 --> 09:22.646
<i>The Golem is now
in Police impound</i>

09:22.730 --> 09:24.815
<i>awaiting a full investigation.</i>

09:24.898 --> 09:27.735
And while it sits there,
I can't finish the building.

09:27.901 --> 09:31.155
<i>Just another example
of technology gone ba-ba-ba...</i>

09:31.363 --> 09:32.865
<i>Bad.</i>

09:33.365 --> 09:35.659
When I get my hands on the jerk
who stole that Golem,

09:35.951 --> 09:37.870
I'm gonna make him sorry
he was ever born.

09:38.162 --> 09:40.247
- Maybe he already is.
- What was that?

09:41.665 --> 09:42.750
Nothing.

09:48.213 --> 09:51.133
Come on, baby.
You know I care about you.

09:51.216 --> 09:52.576
I thought you were
right behind me.

09:52.634 --> 09:55.429
I was. By about a hundred feet.

09:56.847 --> 09:58.599
Big brave Nelson!

09:58.682 --> 10:01.310
I might as well go to the dance
with a twit like Willie Watt.

10:01.560 --> 10:03.187
Willie?

10:07.065 --> 10:09.526
Are you busy Saturday night?

10:09.610 --> 10:11.737
You... You talking about the dance?

10:11.820 --> 10:14.031
- Wanna go or not?
- Uh, yeah.

10:14.114 --> 10:15.616
Great, call me.

10:20.954 --> 10:22.664
Think I'm gonna let some twit
take my girl?

10:32.132 --> 10:34.051
Relax. You're saved.

10:34.426 --> 10:35.803
For now.

11:06.375 --> 11:08.502
Hey, Willie. You all right?

11:08.836 --> 11:10.921
Yeah, I'm great.

11:11.171 --> 11:12.673
Just great.

11:22.599 --> 11:26.103
I know you're there. Getting closer.

11:26.520 --> 11:28.146
I can feel you.

11:38.198 --> 11:40.742
Hey, schoolboy,
where's your hallway pass?

11:40.826 --> 11:43.012
Didn't nobody ever tell you
not to come to Joker territory

11:43.036 --> 11:44.371
without some kinda tribute?

11:44.454 --> 11:47.040
I got something for you.

11:47.124 --> 11:48.584
A joke.

11:49.501 --> 11:51.628
All right, then. Make me laugh.

11:51.712 --> 11:54.923
What's two storeys tall
and eats Jokerz?

11:55.007 --> 11:56.508
- What?
- Him.

12:04.600 --> 12:06.310
You're not laughing.

12:10.188 --> 12:11.708
Let's get out of here.
Let's go, let's go.

12:11.732 --> 12:14.234
- Let's go!
- Move out! Move out!

12:20.032 --> 12:22.701
I knew you'd come.
It's like you're part of me now.

12:29.166 --> 12:32.294
This is so slammin'.
I have you, I have Blade.

12:32.377 --> 12:34.838
From now on,
everything's going to be different.

12:47.684 --> 12:49.770
I'm glad Mr. Wayne
gave you the night off.

12:49.853 --> 12:51.855
This wouldn't have been
as much fun without you.

12:51.939 --> 12:54.691
- You would've come alone?
- Hey, I got a life too, y'know.

12:56.568 --> 12:58.111
- Willie!
- Yes?

12:58.195 --> 13:00.948
- Your hand.
- Oh, sorry.

13:01.365 --> 13:03.909
She's so stupid.

13:09.873 --> 13:11.875
- Would you like some punch?
- Whatever.

13:11.959 --> 13:13.877
Okay. I'll be right back.

13:15.295 --> 13:17.923
- Take your time.
- Hey, Blade.

13:18.006 --> 13:20.842
Nice corsage,
or is it jungle camouflage?

13:20.926 --> 13:22.302
Knock it off, Rhino.

13:22.386 --> 13:24.137
Can't you see how miserable she is?

13:24.221 --> 13:25.889
Like you care.

13:28.183 --> 13:29.518
I do, really.

13:29.601 --> 13:32.145
I can't tell you how sorry I am
for acting the way I did.

13:32.229 --> 13:33.897
Give me another chance, baby.

13:33.981 --> 13:37.192
- You won't be sorry.
- I would, but... Willie.

13:37.275 --> 13:39.569
I'll take care of him. He'll understand.

13:46.660 --> 13:48.954
Come on, Willie boy. We gotta talk.

14:03.552 --> 14:05.595
You had your fun, now get real.

14:05.679 --> 14:07.472
Blade's too hot for a twit like you.

14:07.556 --> 14:10.017
Be smart and step aside.

14:10.100 --> 14:11.393
No!

14:11.768 --> 14:14.146
I'm trying to be generous here, Watt.

14:14.229 --> 14:15.731
I don't need your generosity.

14:17.649 --> 14:20.110
Yeah, you do.

15:37.062 --> 15:38.062
[gunshofl

16:00.669 --> 16:02.921
- Oh, no.
- Sorry, I...

16:03.004 --> 16:05.465
Oh, it wasn't that. Look.

16:10.137 --> 16:12.097
- It's Willie.
- Wet Willie.

16:14.766 --> 16:16.434
Someone should do something.

16:21.523 --> 16:24.151
- Yeah?
<i>- The Golem's heading your way.</i>

16:24.234 --> 16:25.986
<i>I hope you brought your suit.</i>

16:28.864 --> 16:30.532
What are you looking at, twit?

16:32.993 --> 16:35.620
Come on, Willie.
Terry and I will take you home.

16:35.704 --> 16:37.038
I don't need your help.

16:37.122 --> 16:38.790
I don't need anyone's help anymore.

16:55.807 --> 16:58.059
- Nelson!
- Let go!

17:04.900 --> 17:06.568
- Thanks.
- Don't mention it.

17:18.121 --> 17:20.123
You should've stayed out of it, Batman.

17:20.957 --> 17:22.250
Willie!

17:27.839 --> 17:29.257
So you're doing this.

17:29.341 --> 17:31.259
Stop it, right now.

17:35.972 --> 17:37.849
Willie, what are you doing?

17:39.809 --> 17:41.269
Who's the wuss now, Dad?

18:09.756 --> 18:11.299
How are you doing this?

18:11.383 --> 18:13.301
With supreme satisfaction.

18:21.184 --> 18:23.561
- But he's your father.
- Not for long.

18:24.521 --> 18:25.521
Ha!

18:47.127 --> 18:48.503
Jump!

18:48.586 --> 18:50.255
I can't swim!

18:50.338 --> 18:52.007
Terrific.

19:45.518 --> 19:47.270
No!

19:57.989 --> 19:59.324
Come back.

19:59.407 --> 20:00.784
Come back.

20:02.035 --> 20:03.536
Better go talk to him.

20:03.620 --> 20:05.681
I have a feeling you won't be
seeing him for a while.

20:05.705 --> 20:07.791
Yeah, sure caused a lot of trouble.

20:09.417 --> 20:11.628
Guess that means
he ain't no wuss anymore.

20:18.301 --> 20:20.845
<i>And the Golem
has been completely dismantled.</i>

20:20.929 --> 20:23.723
<i>As for the young thief,
he's been sentenced to three years</i>

20:23.807 --> 20:26.309
<i>in a county juvenile facility.</i>

20:26.393 --> 20:28.895
Change the channel, twit.
I wanna watch wrestling.

20:28.978 --> 20:29.813
<i>In other news,
things are looking up</i>

20:29.896 --> 20:31.481
<i>for Gotham's home team.</i>

20:32.023 --> 20:33.733
<i>And now with
the weekend weather outlook...</i>

20:33.817 --> 20:35.944
Yeah, sure caused a lot of trouble.
