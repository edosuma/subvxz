02:31.463 --> 02:33.880
<i>Signore</i> Poirot, your pastries.

02:33.880 --> 02:35.171
Ah, <i>monsieur.</i>

02:37.130 --> 02:39.463
- The eggs came, <i>signore.</i>
- Ah, <i>grazie.</i>

02:43.921 --> 02:45.296
Poirot!

02:45.713 --> 02:47.213
<i>Monsieur</i> Poirot, you must help me.

02:47.213 --> 02:49.630
My parents both
mysteriously died last year.

02:49.630 --> 02:51.546
My brother, soon after.

02:51.546 --> 02:53.338
Our doctor can't explain it.

02:53.838 --> 02:56.088
Please, <i>Monsieur.</i> I fear for my life.

02:56.088 --> 02:57.338
They say we're cursed.

03:03.255 --> 03:04.338
What did I tell you?

03:04.755 --> 03:06.838
Touch him again and I keep your hand.

03:06.838 --> 03:07.921
Excuse me, sir.

03:11.630 --> 03:12.630
<i>Signore</i> Poirot.

03:12.630 --> 03:13.755
I need to speak to you

03:13.755 --> 03:15.380
urgently, please.

03:28.630 --> 03:29.630
Hmm.

03:33.213 --> 03:34.213
<i>Monsieur</i> Poirot,

03:35.963 --> 03:37.046
there is a lady here.

03:37.046 --> 03:39.255
She says she's in Venice
on urgent business.

03:39.255 --> 03:40.921
She says she's a friend of yours.

03:40.921 --> 03:42.005
I don't have any friends.

03:42.005 --> 03:43.588
She said you would say that,

03:43.588 --> 03:45.796
so I should give you this.

03:46.713 --> 03:48.088
The authoress.

03:50.630 --> 03:53.338
Hello, young man. Is your mother at home?

03:53.505 --> 03:56.130
You must forgive my bodyguard.
His instructions are mine.

03:56.130 --> 03:57.838
No one may pass but the pastry man,

03:57.838 --> 03:59.463
- twice a day.
- Twice a day?

03:59.463 --> 04:00.880
You know me.

04:00.880 --> 04:02.380
- Apples only till supper.
- Ah, yes.

04:03.046 --> 04:04.630
Oh, gosh, I like this so much.

04:05.838 --> 04:07.296
Oh, the little chochy-chochy-late.

04:07.296 --> 04:11.588
Hmm. Hercule Poirot really
has gone silent.

04:11.838 --> 04:14.213
Walled himself up into retirement.

04:14.213 --> 04:15.380
Cakes for cases.

04:15.380 --> 04:16.963
I am much satisfied.

04:16.963 --> 04:18.255
No.

04:18.255 --> 04:21.130
This is happiness, not satisfaction.

04:21.130 --> 04:23.046
A writer knows the difference.

04:23.046 --> 04:25.421
Even picked Venice to hide in.

04:25.421 --> 04:28.213
A gorgeous relic,
slowly sinking into the sea,

04:28.213 --> 04:30.796
just like your mind without
a challenge.

04:30.796 --> 04:33.046
Don't underestimate me
for a clever turn of phrase.

04:33.046 --> 04:35.296
I am the world's number one
mystery writer.

04:35.296 --> 04:36.546
Or was, anyway.

04:36.546 --> 04:39.463
Bestsellers, 27 of 30 books.

04:39.463 --> 04:41.046
Damn the critics on the last three.

04:41.046 --> 04:42.671
Called them all small beer.

04:42.671 --> 04:46.005
Ariadne Oliver, it is good to see you.

04:46.005 --> 04:47.588
- You're coming with me.
- Hmm?

04:48.088 --> 04:50.296
Time to put some life back into your life.

04:50.296 --> 04:51.380
Well, then.

04:51.755 --> 04:53.713
Did you not hear? This is urgent.

04:53.713 --> 04:57.713
You are not the first who has come
to seduce me with some irresistible case.

04:57.713 --> 05:00.630
Not a case. It's much spiffier than that.

05:02.213 --> 05:05.255
You really are cut off from the world.
Do you not know what today is?

05:07.338 --> 05:08.588
What is "spiffier"?

05:13.921 --> 05:15.588
Happy Halloween! Yeah!

05:17.088 --> 05:19.921
We Americans imported loud music
and terrible chocolate,

05:19.921 --> 05:21.921
but we also brought back Halloween.

05:21.921 --> 05:23.838
There's a party tonight for the children.

05:23.838 --> 05:24.963
Hey, kids!

05:24.963 --> 05:27.171
America says, "Happy Halloween!"

05:27.630 --> 05:29.963
Hey! Happy Halloween! Let's go!

05:32.130 --> 05:35.130
Poirot,
I've found something. Someone.

05:35.130 --> 05:36.463
I can't explain it.

05:36.463 --> 05:40.296
I've looked at it from every which way,
and I can't figure it out.

05:40.296 --> 05:42.671
You are up
to something, my friend.

05:43.963 --> 05:46.255
Well, "The Unholy Ms. Reynolds."

05:47.838 --> 05:50.505
She's a spiritualist
or a medium, according to the papers.

05:50.505 --> 05:52.880
"Joyce Reynolds,
recently released from jail

05:52.880 --> 05:55.171
"was the last woman on record imprisoned

05:55.171 --> 05:59.005
"under the terms of
the Witchcraft Act of 1735."

05:59.005 --> 06:01.338
I've seen a million of these
so-called psychics,

06:01.338 --> 06:03.171
each one a flimflam fake.

06:03.171 --> 06:04.296
Then, there's that one.

06:04.963 --> 06:06.296
Astonishing.

06:06.296 --> 06:07.755
I tell you, this Ms Reynolds,

06:07.755 --> 06:09.213
I sat at a séance.

06:09.213 --> 06:11.296
- Things happened.
- Tricks.

06:11.296 --> 06:13.880
I am the smartest person I ever met,
and I can't figure it out.

06:13.880 --> 06:15.255
So, I came to the second.

06:15.755 --> 06:18.421
I need Detective Poirot
to pop this balloon

06:18.421 --> 06:21.005
or God help me, I will end up a believer.

06:21.005 --> 06:22.213
Spot the con I can't.

06:22.213 --> 06:24.296
Come with me to the orphans'
Halloween party.

06:24.296 --> 06:27.505
Then, afterwards,
we're invited to a séance.

06:28.963 --> 06:30.380
Hey, boys,
there's a Halloween party.

06:30.380 --> 06:31.505
You're taking her on a date?

06:34.505 --> 06:36.046
Enjoy the party, kids.

06:36.046 --> 06:37.463
Don't get too scared now.

07:29.005 --> 07:30.130
There it is.

07:31.255 --> 07:33.130
<i>Palazzo Lacrime dei Giovani.</i>

07:34.130 --> 07:36.088
In Venice, we say,

07:36.088 --> 07:38.130
"Every house is haunted

07:38.963 --> 07:40.255
"or cursed."

08:00.088 --> 08:02.130
Are you ready, children?

08:02.130 --> 08:04.546
Yeah!

08:09.880 --> 08:11.130
Long ago,

08:12.005 --> 08:14.713
this palazzo was an orphanage.

08:15.838 --> 08:20.505
Good doctors and good nurses
took care of good children.

08:21.213 --> 08:22.505
Until the Plague.

08:24.130 --> 08:26.588
Plagues make people afraid

08:27.171 --> 08:30.171
and fear makes people do terrible things.

08:34.213 --> 08:36.255
Is it not too frightening
for the children?

08:36.255 --> 08:39.046
Hmm. Scary stories make life less scary.

08:41.921 --> 08:45.713
The children soon
realized they were alone.

08:45.713 --> 08:48.546
Locked inside to die.

08:48.546 --> 08:51.296
Starving, calling, clawing.

08:54.213 --> 08:57.546
Some say the children are
still hiding in this palazzo

08:57.546 --> 09:00.005
and they want more children to join them.

09:00.005 --> 09:01.755
So, you be careful.

09:01.755 --> 09:05.046
For they want revenge
on the doctors and nurses

09:05.046 --> 09:06.880
who left them here to die.

09:08.088 --> 09:10.088
Watch out for the mark

09:10.088 --> 09:11.755
of the Children's Vendetta.

09:14.630 --> 09:17.088
No one here is a doctor,
are they? Huh?

09:17.088 --> 09:18.796
No.
- Or a nurse?

09:18.796 --> 09:20.755
No.
No?

09:20.755 --> 09:24.588
Then, I guess it's safe
to start the party!

09:35.755 --> 09:37.296
Don't! Stop running.

09:54.505 --> 09:55.505
Leopold.

09:56.213 --> 09:57.255
Leopold.

09:59.296 --> 10:03.171
There's an actual, literal party
and you're hiding in a book.

10:03.171 --> 10:05.380
I thought you might play
with other children for once.

10:05.588 --> 10:07.046
Games are frivolous.

10:08.005 --> 10:10.046
The Halloween calls for horror stories.

10:10.046 --> 10:11.671
Don't you think so, Miss Olga?

10:12.796 --> 10:14.463
Don't you at least want some cake?

10:15.588 --> 10:17.130
That's for the orphans.

10:20.880 --> 10:22.213
I'll check on father.

10:22.213 --> 10:23.838
He's no good at parties.

10:29.505 --> 10:31.505
<i>The boys are home again</i>

10:32.046 --> 10:33.505
Oh. Nun alert.

10:35.588 --> 10:38.546
Ms. Oliver, it's a thrill
to have you here.

10:38.546 --> 10:40.255
- You're my favorite author.
- Ah.

10:40.255 --> 10:43.796
Your mysteries give me faith
the wicked will meet justice.

10:44.630 --> 10:47.588
Sadly, life doesn't round out
so well as detective fiction.

10:57.005 --> 10:58.088
Whoa!

10:58.088 --> 11:00.171
Yes. <i>Bonsoir.</i>

11:03.171 --> 11:04.296
Are you all right?

11:04.296 --> 11:05.588
It's so high.

11:05.588 --> 11:08.130
Oh, I understand.
It's very dark up here, isn't it?

11:13.880 --> 11:15.005
And this is our hostess?

11:15.005 --> 11:18.296
This is my house.
The soprano, Rowena Drake.

11:18.671 --> 11:20.671
A diva's life of glamor.

11:22.255 --> 11:23.255
But she lives here.

11:23.255 --> 11:24.921
Where did all the money go?

11:25.296 --> 11:28.755
Everyone who ever lived here
falls victim to some tragedy.

11:28.755 --> 11:30.421
That's the legend, anyway.

11:30.421 --> 11:32.171
The Children's Vendetta.

11:32.755 --> 11:36.463
Someone sees a child's shadow on the wall,
and then darkness comes.

11:36.463 --> 11:37.838
Like her daughter a year ago.

11:40.005 --> 11:41.546
<i>That's who we're to hear from tonight.</i>

11:41.546 --> 11:43.963
The lost girl from beyond.

11:44.963 --> 11:46.796
I will not believe in such things.

11:47.671 --> 11:48.713
We'll see.

11:49.296 --> 11:51.255
Oh, sweetheart,
you're gonna be all right.

11:54.463 --> 11:56.255
Ms Rowena, it's leaking again.

11:57.713 --> 11:59.213
Dad?

11:59.963 --> 12:01.255
Are you all right, Dad?

12:05.713 --> 12:06.963
Do you need a pill?

12:08.380 --> 12:09.505
No.

12:10.921 --> 12:12.005
Take some punch, then?

12:12.796 --> 12:14.880
We could go, if you'd prefer.

12:15.880 --> 12:16.880
It's all right.

12:17.505 --> 12:19.171
I promised Rowena I'd stay.

12:20.380 --> 12:21.380
Good.

12:21.380 --> 12:23.671
I was looking forward to the séance.

12:26.463 --> 12:28.880
You do the children
a great kindness, <i>madame.</i>

12:30.296 --> 12:31.421
Adults, too.

12:32.088 --> 12:34.213
You care to bob for an apple, Mr. Poirot?

12:34.213 --> 12:35.880
- It looks like fun.

12:36.463 --> 12:38.213
The fun is not for me.

12:45.463 --> 12:46.796
I am glad for it.

12:47.171 --> 12:49.755
It's been far too long
since there was laughter in this house.

12:49.755 --> 12:52.255
Well, it is a remarkable palazzo.

12:52.796 --> 12:53.838
You can have it.

12:55.338 --> 12:58.171
See, I can't afford to fix it
and I can't stand to look at it.

12:59.755 --> 13:02.421
And no one will buy it
at any price. Not after...

13:04.130 --> 13:06.713
<i>Please, oh, God, no!</i>

13:15.005 --> 13:16.005
Forgive me.

13:18.380 --> 13:23.588
I had hoped that seeing
all these faces might make it hurt less.

13:24.838 --> 13:26.588
- Mrs. Rowena?
Yes?

13:26.588 --> 13:27.880
Your guest is here.

13:31.630 --> 13:33.255
God, I'm actually nervous.

13:35.671 --> 13:37.171
You believe in psychics?

13:40.630 --> 13:42.171
This house made me believe.

13:43.255 --> 13:44.463
It holds voices.

13:44.963 --> 13:45.963
Whispers.

13:46.796 --> 13:47.796
Sobbing.

13:49.130 --> 13:51.755
My daughter used to stay up
at night talking.

13:52.880 --> 13:54.213
I thought it was with her dolls.

13:55.421 --> 13:56.588
My daughter,

13:57.838 --> 13:59.463
to hear her voice again.

14:00.838 --> 14:01.838
A word.

14:03.963 --> 14:06.505
I would give that Ms. Reynolds all I have.

14:45.838 --> 14:47.755
This one will be very sad.

14:49.213 --> 14:50.213
Ms. Reynolds.

14:52.213 --> 14:54.963
Everything is prepared for you
in the salon.

14:54.963 --> 14:56.963
As your assistant specified.

14:58.713 --> 15:00.963
So noisy, your home.

15:00.963 --> 15:03.463
The children will be gone before we begin.

15:04.755 --> 15:05.796
So many.

15:06.630 --> 15:07.630
Everywhere.

15:09.296 --> 15:10.796
Horrible memories.

15:14.046 --> 15:16.130
Your daughter's room
is on the third floor.

15:17.921 --> 15:19.088
How did you...?

15:19.088 --> 15:20.588
May we do it there?

15:21.380 --> 15:22.421
Of course.

15:33.130 --> 15:34.921
Ariadne Oliver.

15:34.921 --> 15:36.463
My nemesis.

15:36.463 --> 15:39.463
We meet again.
The unholy Ms. Joyce Reynolds.

15:39.463 --> 15:41.546
The press coined that one.

15:41.546 --> 15:42.671
Not sure if I like it.

15:42.671 --> 15:43.963
<i>Bonsoir, madame,</i>

15:43.963 --> 15:47.588
I must say that I expected someone more...

15:47.588 --> 15:48.963
Dramatic? Ridiculous?

15:48.963 --> 15:50.046
An old crone?

15:50.046 --> 15:52.963
Yes, this is the perfect word.

15:52.963 --> 15:54.921
The croney. The old croney.

15:54.921 --> 15:57.296
I didn't ask to be what I am.

15:57.296 --> 16:00.130
Why I like the term "medium,"
sort of middling.

16:00.130 --> 16:03.296
I'm not big or small.
I'm not interesting at all.

16:03.796 --> 16:06.171
But I can talk to the dead.

16:06.671 --> 16:07.838
And you?

16:07.838 --> 16:09.671
I am Hercule Poirot.

16:10.005 --> 16:11.421
You were Hercule Poirot.

16:11.421 --> 16:12.880
The detective.

16:12.880 --> 16:15.755
You're anything but medium.
You're quite famous.

16:15.755 --> 16:18.005
Am I your next quite famous case?

16:18.463 --> 16:20.088
I am retired from cases.

16:21.005 --> 16:24.005
But you are here to discredit me.

16:24.005 --> 16:26.380
Isn't that why
the great writer brought you?

16:29.713 --> 16:31.921
I am here as a favor
to Ms. Oliver

16:31.921 --> 16:34.630
who is eager to divine
your means of divination.

16:34.630 --> 16:35.713
I must tell you, <i>madame,</i>

16:35.713 --> 16:39.213
I have been all my life,
uncharmed by your kind.

16:39.838 --> 16:40.838
My kind?

16:40.838 --> 16:44.421
Opportunists who prey
on the vulnerable, no?

16:44.421 --> 16:46.588
You don't believe in the soul's endurance

16:46.588 --> 16:47.671
after death?

16:47.671 --> 16:48.880
I have lost my faith.

16:48.880 --> 16:50.588
How sad for you.

16:50.588 --> 16:52.630
Yes, it is most sad. The truth is sad.

16:56.213 --> 16:57.296
Please understand, <i>madame,</i>

16:57.296 --> 16:59.213
I would welcome with open arms

16:59.213 --> 17:02.838
any honest sign of devil or demon or ghost

17:02.838 --> 17:05.546
for if there is a ghost, there is a soul.

17:05.546 --> 17:08.046
If there is a soul,
there is a God who made it,

17:08.046 --> 17:10.505
and if we have God,
then we have everything.

17:10.505 --> 17:12.755
Meaning, order, justice.

17:12.755 --> 17:15.005
But I have seen too much of the world.

17:15.005 --> 17:17.171
Countless crime, two wars,

17:17.171 --> 17:21.671
the bitter evil of human indifference,
and I conclude, no.

17:21.671 --> 17:23.213
No God, no ghosts.

17:23.213 --> 17:25.630
With respect, no mediums
who can speak to them.

17:38.338 --> 17:39.463
You were saying?

18:01.338 --> 18:03.546
As if I didn't have enough to clean.

18:03.546 --> 18:05.713
Shouldn't even be here past dark.

18:05.713 --> 18:07.338
I don't think they'll bother us.

18:08.088 --> 18:09.088
Who?

18:11.380 --> 18:13.130
What happens past dark?

18:13.130 --> 18:15.546
Well, still a charlatan?

18:15.546 --> 18:19.338
A ceiling weakened by water damage,
unused to rollicking footsteps.

18:19.338 --> 18:22.505
No credit for theatrical timing.

18:27.630 --> 18:29.588
Ms. Alicia's room is up here.

18:31.796 --> 18:34.005
<i>When the lights go on again</i>

18:35.296 --> 18:37.296
<i>All over the world</i>

18:38.171 --> 18:39.171
<i>And the...</i>

18:44.171 --> 18:46.213
If I may, please, how did the girl die?

18:46.213 --> 18:48.046
The balcony. The canal.

18:48.046 --> 18:49.421
- Drowning.
- A suicide.

18:49.421 --> 18:52.171
It wasn't her fault.
They pushed her to it.

18:52.171 --> 18:53.505
Mrs. Seminoff, please.

18:53.505 --> 18:54.796
What then, Doctor?

18:54.796 --> 18:57.046
You cared for her. You saw.

19:07.755 --> 19:09.171
Uh, wait, please.

19:11.838 --> 19:13.463
Who has been inside here tonight?

19:13.463 --> 19:15.255
Ms. Reynolds, her assistant?

19:15.255 --> 19:17.130
No one. I have the only key.

19:17.796 --> 19:20.671
No one's stepped foot here
since Ms. Alicia passed but me.

19:21.921 --> 19:24.630
- To dust a bit and to check on Harry.

19:25.546 --> 19:26.546
Who is Harry?

19:30.296 --> 19:31.380
Her friend.

19:32.171 --> 19:33.421
She told him everything.

19:35.338 --> 19:37.296
He used to speak before she died.

19:38.755 --> 19:39.838
Now, he just cries.

19:43.713 --> 19:45.921
Everything is just as she left it.

19:49.630 --> 19:51.838
Ms. Rowena wouldn't let me move a thing.

20:18.463 --> 20:20.505
<i>Alicia and her
were inseparable.</i>

20:20.505 --> 20:22.296
Can't catch me!
Yes, I can!

20:22.296 --> 20:24.838
<i>This palazzo was their oasis.</i>

20:25.421 --> 20:28.046
<i>Only a week at a time
between travel for the opera.</i>

20:29.130 --> 20:32.255
<i>But Alicia had the children's
ghosts for company.</i>

20:33.380 --> 20:35.088
<i>She grew so beautiful.</i>

20:36.130 --> 20:38.255
<i>Then she met her chef, Maxime.</i>

20:40.255 --> 20:42.088
<i>They were engaged so fast.</i>

20:43.171 --> 20:44.380
<i>So in love.</i>

20:45.130 --> 20:47.171
Then, she and her fiancé quarreled.

20:48.255 --> 20:50.546
She moved back here to the palazzo.

20:50.546 --> 20:53.505
That's when she started
to see the children.

20:53.505 --> 20:55.588
They wanted her for themselves.

20:56.505 --> 20:59.046
She suffered her last weeks in that bed

20:59.046 --> 21:00.921
<i>- seeing things.</i>

21:00.921 --> 21:02.255
<i>Shadows.</i>

21:02.255 --> 21:04.505
<i>The children are calling her, she said.</i>

21:04.505 --> 21:07.130
"They want you here with them."

21:07.130 --> 21:08.546
<i>They drove her mad.</i>

21:11.630 --> 21:14.088
Ms. Rowena didn't leave her side,

21:14.088 --> 21:16.755
<i>begging the spirits to let her be.</i>

21:18.630 --> 21:19.630
They didn't.

21:23.963 --> 21:25.421
<i>- They left the mark</i>

21:26.088 --> 21:28.171
<i>of the Children's Vendetta.</i>

21:28.171 --> 21:30.588
The police said the cuts
were from the fall.

21:32.130 --> 21:33.380
The police...

21:34.213 --> 21:35.880
Listening.

21:35.880 --> 21:39.046
Now, this woman, she wants
to disturb Alicia's soul.

21:40.213 --> 21:41.505
Listening.

21:41.505 --> 21:44.005
And I am telling you, <i>monsieur,</i>
this is not right.

21:45.421 --> 21:47.588
This is against nature and the Good Lord.

21:48.796 --> 21:50.338
Somebody will have to pay.

21:51.546 --> 21:53.088
Listening.

21:56.046 --> 21:58.046
So much pain here.

22:10.005 --> 22:11.005
Baba.

22:12.421 --> 22:13.421
Yeah.

22:14.171 --> 22:15.463
Baba the Rabbit.

22:27.880 --> 22:28.963
Maxime, no.

22:28.963 --> 22:31.546
"Maxime, be at Palazzo, 10 p.m.

22:31.546 --> 22:33.588
"Important news about Alicia Drake."

22:33.588 --> 22:35.130
- I was invited.
- Not by me.

22:35.130 --> 22:37.088
You're always trying
to kick me out, Rowena.

22:37.088 --> 22:38.505
It's never worked before.

22:38.505 --> 22:40.546
If there's something to hear,
I'll hear it.

22:40.546 --> 22:42.380
Well, tell that to your new fiancée.

22:42.380 --> 22:45.088
Waited a whole six months
after Alicia died.

22:45.088 --> 22:46.338
I hear she's insensibly rich.

22:46.338 --> 22:48.963
Land-grants-from-King-George rich.

22:48.963 --> 22:51.338
Bought me my own bistro on Madison Avenue.

22:51.338 --> 22:53.588
I'm gonna be a New Yorker and a rich one,

22:53.588 --> 22:56.421
which is the only kind to be.

22:56.421 --> 22:58.130
You should come visit.
I'll buy you a hot dog.

22:58.130 --> 22:59.421
Should I throw him out?

22:59.421 --> 23:00.505
Try it.

23:02.088 --> 23:03.296
Give me the excuse.

23:04.463 --> 23:07.213
Do whatever you want, Maxime.
You always do.

23:09.130 --> 23:10.338
I lost too, Rowena.

23:16.255 --> 23:17.963
How many are we? Nine or 10?

23:17.963 --> 23:20.630
Oh, I don't know. Take 12 chairs, I think.

23:20.630 --> 23:22.296
A full house.

23:22.296 --> 23:25.546
A séance? Christ in a hat!
Is that what this is?

23:32.088 --> 23:33.088
A typewriter.

23:34.338 --> 23:36.921
No Ouija board? Crystal ball?

23:37.588 --> 23:40.171
I think myself more secretary
than anything.

23:40.838 --> 23:42.421
The voices speak...

23:44.546 --> 23:46.338
...and I take dictation.

23:51.546 --> 23:54.963
Leopold, perhaps
go and read in the library.

23:54.963 --> 23:56.380
I want to see Alicia.

23:57.130 --> 23:58.255
She was my friend too.

23:58.255 --> 24:00.130
You're not scared of ghosts?

24:00.130 --> 24:02.171
I talk to ghosts here all the time.

24:02.171 --> 24:03.255
Do you?

24:05.005 --> 24:06.338
They say you're a fake.

24:22.505 --> 24:25.796
No one touch me
until the trance has ended.

24:27.546 --> 24:29.421
Alicia Drake,

24:29.755 --> 24:32.671
I believe it was you who called to me.

24:39.796 --> 24:41.963
Too many spirits.

24:42.463 --> 24:45.755
This house is spilling with the dead.

24:46.838 --> 24:49.171
Some souls can't let go.

24:49.171 --> 24:50.505
Do we stop, Ms. Reynolds?

24:51.130 --> 24:52.130
No.

24:52.630 --> 24:56.546
If someone wants to be heard, we are here.

24:57.463 --> 24:58.463
Listening.

25:00.005 --> 25:04.421
Spirits, you scream and shout
and no one hears.

25:04.421 --> 25:05.796
We do now.

25:06.838 --> 25:08.421
Alicia Drake,

25:08.421 --> 25:10.921
find your voice.

25:12.130 --> 25:14.505
It just got cold.
Does anyone else feel a chill?

25:14.505 --> 25:16.255
Is someone there?

25:21.838 --> 25:23.421
"Y."

25:23.838 --> 25:24.838
Yes.

25:25.588 --> 25:26.963
She didn't touch the key, I swear.

25:26.963 --> 25:29.255
She must have.
You can't all be such fools.

25:29.255 --> 25:31.005
This is wrong. This is very wrong.

25:31.005 --> 25:32.505
Who is there?

25:32.505 --> 25:34.046
Alicia Drake.

25:34.046 --> 25:36.046
Listening.

25:36.046 --> 25:37.421
We are here.

25:37.963 --> 25:39.255
Listening.

25:39.713 --> 25:41.421
It is the hallow tide.

25:41.421 --> 25:42.630
We are close.

25:42.630 --> 25:44.421
Your spirit is close,

25:44.421 --> 25:46.713
- your voice is loud.

25:48.546 --> 25:50.338
- Alicia.

25:50.338 --> 25:51.546
"A." Alicia.

25:51.546 --> 25:54.380
Alicia, I feel you are in pain.

25:54.380 --> 25:56.588
Does it hurt? Please, tell me.

25:57.796 --> 26:00.171
- Did someone hurt you?

26:00.171 --> 26:01.255
Yes.
No!

26:02.213 --> 26:03.713
Poirot, let her finish!

26:03.713 --> 26:05.755
- No! First, let us meet...

26:05.755 --> 26:09.046
...a secret confederate in the chimney.

26:10.671 --> 26:12.296
Nicholas, are you hurt?

26:12.296 --> 26:13.546
I'm all right.

26:13.546 --> 26:17.421
Ah, Nicholas.
The second assistant.

26:17.421 --> 26:18.755
I am pleased to meet you.

26:18.755 --> 26:22.380
By your similar and piercing green eyes,

26:22.380 --> 26:25.546
I take you for the first
assistant's half-brother.

26:25.546 --> 26:28.796
Ah, a magnetic switch.

26:30.588 --> 26:33.005
<i>Et voilà,</i> the talking typewriter.

26:33.005 --> 26:34.630
- A fake?
- Mrs. Seminoff,

26:34.630 --> 26:36.880
your dedication to housekeeping
could be improved.

26:36.880 --> 26:38.130
No one had been in this room except you,

26:38.130 --> 26:41.046
yet my new friend left
his footstep in the fireplace.

26:41.046 --> 26:44.255
The bright scratch at the keyhole
indicates a lock recently picked.

26:44.755 --> 26:46.755
Ms. Oliver, you must find
a new subject for your book.

26:46.755 --> 26:48.796
Ms. Drake, I am sorry for your loss,

26:48.796 --> 26:51.213
but this oracle is a fake.

27:15.588 --> 27:17.380
- Where's Baba?
Alicia.

27:17.380 --> 27:18.755
- Did someone take him?

27:18.755 --> 27:20.588
- Did you?
- I didn't touch anything.

27:27.963 --> 27:29.380
Alicia.

27:30.380 --> 27:31.463
Mama.

27:34.338 --> 27:35.338
Mama?

27:37.796 --> 27:38.880
Thirsty.

27:39.963 --> 27:40.963
So...

27:40.963 --> 27:42.171
Thirsty.

27:43.255 --> 27:44.255
Alicia?

27:47.338 --> 27:48.755
Hurt.

27:50.005 --> 27:51.630
Why would you leave me?

27:51.630 --> 27:52.713
No.

27:53.838 --> 27:55.130
I don't want...

27:55.130 --> 27:56.630
I don't...

27:56.630 --> 27:58.171
...want to die.

27:58.171 --> 28:00.130
- What is happening?

28:00.130 --> 28:01.296
Alicia

28:01.713 --> 28:03.213
showing me.

28:03.213 --> 28:04.380
I see her

28:04.838 --> 28:06.213
on the balcony.

28:06.213 --> 28:07.296
Not alone.

28:07.796 --> 28:09.171
She didn't jump.

28:09.171 --> 28:11.671
Murderer!

28:11.671 --> 28:14.463
You killed me. You killed me.

28:14.463 --> 28:15.546
Who?

28:16.796 --> 28:18.671
Show me. Who?

28:18.671 --> 28:22.005
You killed me! You killed me!

28:22.005 --> 28:23.088
You killed me!

28:23.088 --> 28:24.505
Who hurt you?

28:24.505 --> 28:26.005
You killed me!

28:26.005 --> 28:27.088
You killed me!

28:27.088 --> 28:28.171
Show me!

28:28.171 --> 28:29.380
You killed me!

28:29.380 --> 28:30.463
Who hurt you?

28:30.463 --> 28:31.838
What happened?

28:33.088 --> 28:34.088
Murder!

28:58.588 --> 29:00.005
Satanic.

29:00.005 --> 29:01.671
She truly is unholy.

29:02.671 --> 29:04.088
It was Alicia's voice.

29:05.380 --> 29:06.755
Someone must have killed her.

29:07.505 --> 29:09.005
We can't prove any of it was real.

29:09.005 --> 29:11.130
Then, what was it?
- Showmanship.

29:11.130 --> 29:12.713
Theater. Catching us in a group hysteria.

29:12.713 --> 29:14.463
That wasn't <i>War of the Worlds</i>
on the radio.

29:14.463 --> 29:16.880
The damn doors blew open.
I can't explain it.

29:16.880 --> 29:17.963
I can.

29:18.630 --> 29:20.005
That was my daughter.

29:22.421 --> 29:23.630
Oh, no.

29:23.630 --> 29:25.796
Don't you dare leave without saying it.

29:25.796 --> 29:27.880
You saw what I saw,
and what you saw was...

29:27.880 --> 29:29.005
Was fake.

29:29.005 --> 29:31.880
Real. That woman is proof. Living proof.

29:31.880 --> 29:33.755
There's a title.

29:33.755 --> 29:36.630
Sure as hell, she's my next book,
and sure as hell, it's a hit.

29:36.630 --> 29:38.588
A big beer book.

29:38.588 --> 29:41.088
Good God, I have to start
writing right away.

29:41.088 --> 29:43.171
The woman who stumped Hercule Poirot.

29:43.171 --> 29:47.463
I admit I cannot solve all of her methods
in this moment, but of course I will.

29:47.463 --> 29:48.921
You won't. Come on.

29:48.921 --> 29:50.046
You should be relieved.

29:50.046 --> 29:54.171
And how incredible to believe,
to know the world has mystery.

29:54.171 --> 29:57.296
A God who cares enough
to make abiding souls.

29:57.296 --> 29:59.588
- After death comes...
- Nothing.

29:59.588 --> 30:00.963
Something.

30:02.588 --> 30:04.755
If there was a God, he would
not break his rule for her.

30:14.005 --> 30:15.005
You're all right.

30:16.671 --> 30:18.505
I hope you'll be back tomorrow.

30:18.921 --> 30:21.296
Rowena made me promise
to sit for her again.

30:26.838 --> 30:31.213
And Miss Oliver says I should
prepare to be quite famous.

30:31.213 --> 30:32.963
<i>Dottore,</i> I'll find us a boat.

30:32.963 --> 30:34.046
<i>Grazie.</i>

30:34.046 --> 30:36.796
These spirits were particularly savage.

30:37.880 --> 30:40.255
Sittings always exact a price.

30:41.005 --> 30:42.463
As I'm sure do you.

30:43.671 --> 30:46.630
You are amongst frauds, the gifted one.

30:47.130 --> 30:48.546
I wish I was a fraud.

30:49.630 --> 30:52.213
- Be less painful.

30:52.213 --> 30:54.630
I think you know
something of this, <i>monsieur.</i>

30:55.130 --> 30:57.713
Someone dies and we comfort the grieving

30:57.713 --> 31:00.088
with secrets plain to us.

31:00.671 --> 31:03.671
Both creatures who speak for the dead,

31:04.046 --> 31:06.880
who know the dead too well, I think.

31:08.213 --> 31:09.838
Imagine...

31:09.838 --> 31:13.088
a war nurse who hears ghosts,

31:14.213 --> 31:16.255
surrounded by screaming.

31:17.546 --> 31:19.130
On her ward,

31:19.130 --> 31:20.671
inside her mind.

31:21.380 --> 31:25.338
Wave after wave of the dying and the dead.

31:26.463 --> 31:30.005
And the only thing that stopped the pain

31:30.005 --> 31:32.588
was telling the mourners what I heard.

31:32.588 --> 31:35.838
Ease their suffering as only I can.

31:38.005 --> 31:39.338
You'd begrudge that?

31:39.338 --> 31:43.713
You made a mother believe
her daughter's soul is in torment.

31:43.713 --> 31:45.213
This is not generous.

31:45.213 --> 31:46.671
Not gentle, not humble.

31:46.671 --> 31:47.963
I felt pain.

31:47.963 --> 31:49.380
I saw a murder...

31:49.380 --> 31:51.713
Did you see who killed Alicia Drake?

31:51.713 --> 31:53.963
It was not revealed. Maybe tomorrow.

31:53.963 --> 31:55.755
- A lucrative convenience.
- Why is this...?

31:55.755 --> 31:57.880
Terrors for children, Ms. Reynolds.

31:57.880 --> 31:59.380
You might learn from them.

32:00.755 --> 32:02.171
Children can suffer,

32:02.921 --> 32:04.755
as much as those orphans,

32:04.755 --> 32:08.838
and still laugh and play
and bob for apples.

32:08.838 --> 32:10.338
They're alive.

32:10.338 --> 32:11.755
But you...

32:12.130 --> 32:14.088
Death everywhere you went.

32:15.005 --> 32:16.463
All your life.

32:17.755 --> 32:18.921
Soldiers...

32:19.963 --> 32:20.963
Friends...

32:23.005 --> 32:24.005
Katherine.

32:28.421 --> 32:29.880
We shall not meet again.

32:32.171 --> 32:34.005
You persist that you are real.

32:34.755 --> 32:38.088
And if I'm not, who's getting hurt?

32:38.088 --> 32:40.713
Magic won't come unless you call it in,

32:40.713 --> 32:44.255
unless it really is all true.

32:52.213 --> 32:53.713
Lighten up, pal.

32:55.046 --> 32:56.380
You might have fun.

32:58.005 --> 32:59.630
I'd say to remember me,

33:01.380 --> 33:02.421
but you will.

34:23.046 --> 34:24.046
"Lighten up."

35:10.046 --> 35:11.255
<i>Monsieur</i> Poirot!

35:11.255 --> 35:12.713
<i>Dottore!</i>

35:12.713 --> 35:13.921
<i>Monsieur</i> Poirot!

35:13.921 --> 35:15.921
<i>- Dottore!</i>

35:17.130 --> 35:19.421
<i>Monsieur</i> Poirot, can you hear me?

35:19.421 --> 35:20.588
Who did this?

35:21.671 --> 35:24.213
I left Ms. Reynolds...

35:26.088 --> 35:28.630
I stopped by the apples. Silly.

35:30.921 --> 35:32.130
I lifted my mask.

35:35.130 --> 35:36.463
It was her mask.

35:38.546 --> 35:39.963
Where is Ms. Reynolds?

35:45.338 --> 35:46.421
What was that?

35:46.421 --> 35:47.505
What's going on?
What was that?

35:47.505 --> 35:48.838
Was that her?
What's happening?

35:51.546 --> 35:52.546
What?

36:20.255 --> 36:21.713
I will call my old station.

36:22.338 --> 36:23.630
I should know the man on duty.

36:26.838 --> 36:28.421
I thought my cupboards were bare.

36:28.421 --> 36:30.838
No, I scrounged up some tea
left from the party.

36:31.338 --> 36:33.755
Found your honey in the linen closet.

36:33.755 --> 36:34.838
<i>Merci.</i>

36:37.380 --> 36:38.421
Vitale Portfoglio.

36:38.421 --> 36:39.505
What do we do?

36:40.338 --> 36:41.463
She was our ticket.

36:43.213 --> 36:44.505
We'll get there without her.

36:45.005 --> 36:46.005
I promise.

36:47.546 --> 36:49.296
None of you saw anyone on the stairs?

36:49.713 --> 36:51.213
Some things can't be seen.

36:51.213 --> 36:52.380
Maybe she jumped.

36:53.255 --> 36:54.255
She seemed the type.

36:54.255 --> 36:57.046
No. Not Ms. Reynolds. Never.

36:57.046 --> 36:58.505
She talked about a murder.

36:58.505 --> 36:59.588
She could have known something.

36:59.588 --> 37:01.380
You still think she's real?

37:01.380 --> 37:04.255
Please. She made up that murder idea
to impress a famous author

37:04.255 --> 37:06.213
and to bait the hook
on a new income stream.

37:06.213 --> 37:08.130
- Then, why is she dead?
- Gravity.

37:08.130 --> 37:10.296
She spoke in Alicia's voice.

37:10.296 --> 37:11.380
Don't look at me.

37:11.380 --> 37:13.421
I was being interrogated
by your lady writer.

37:13.421 --> 37:15.838
Ask her. Then, ask the doctor
where he was.

37:15.838 --> 37:17.755
Sick bastard already killed here once.

37:17.755 --> 37:20.171
It wasn't either of them.
You know what it was.

37:20.796 --> 37:22.796
Hateful things live in this house.

37:22.796 --> 37:25.171
That woman called to them
and they answered.

37:27.338 --> 37:29.921
In the war, before she did sittings.

37:29.921 --> 37:31.588
Ms. Reynolds was in the British Army.

37:31.588 --> 37:34.088
She served with the camps at Malta.

37:34.088 --> 37:35.880
- She was a nurse.
A nurse.

37:36.338 --> 37:37.796
The Children's Vendetta.

37:40.088 --> 37:41.546
The canals are not safe.

37:41.546 --> 37:43.505
We can't get a boat here
until the storm clears.

37:43.505 --> 37:44.588
When will that be?

37:44.588 --> 37:46.088
It's out of
police control, <i>signora.</i>

37:46.088 --> 37:48.171
Well, I won't sit here and wait.

37:48.171 --> 37:50.921
I never spent the night
in this house before and I won't now.

37:53.213 --> 37:54.588
Hey!
What's going on?

37:54.588 --> 37:56.005
Sir, you can't do this.

37:56.005 --> 37:57.463
You can't lock us in here.

37:57.463 --> 37:59.421
What are you doing?
- You can't trap us here.

38:03.046 --> 38:05.171
A medium boasts of having
a vision of murder.

38:05.171 --> 38:06.255
Now, she is dead.

38:06.255 --> 38:07.838
One of you felt her eyes upon you.

38:07.838 --> 38:09.546
Killed her, tried to kill me.

38:09.546 --> 38:11.630
No one should leave this place
until I know who.

38:12.046 --> 38:14.380
<i>Commissario,</i> stand here
and see these gates do not open.

38:14.380 --> 38:16.505
<i>Monsieur</i> Gerard, stand here
and watch the <i>commissario.</i>

38:16.505 --> 38:18.005
You suspect me? I was a cop.

38:18.005 --> 38:19.921
All the more reason to suspect you.

38:19.921 --> 38:21.171
They already killed tonight.

38:21.171 --> 38:22.838
You will all have your chance to speak.

38:22.838 --> 38:24.380
And call back the police.

38:24.880 --> 38:28.380
Tell them Hercule Poirot is on the case.

38:44.755 --> 38:46.130
Oh, is this where she...?

38:48.338 --> 38:49.588
The attempt on my life occurred

38:49.588 --> 38:53.755
at approximately two minutes
after the chime of midnight.

38:53.755 --> 38:57.130
You were the first
to find the body at, uh...?

38:57.130 --> 38:59.880
Don't you dare look at me
like a murder suspect.

38:59.880 --> 39:01.046
We're old friends.

39:01.671 --> 39:03.713
Every murderer is somebody's old friend.

39:04.046 --> 39:06.088
But you have written
too many clever murders

39:06.088 --> 39:07.630
to fall at the foot of your first victim.

39:07.630 --> 39:12.005
And you are so far viably alibied
by the chef, for the time,

39:12.005 --> 39:14.880
which is why I shall now ask you
to assist me in my investigation.

39:14.880 --> 39:17.963
- When do we start?
- When you collect for me our host.

39:23.296 --> 39:24.671
I knew you were in there somewhere.

39:24.671 --> 39:27.046
All it took was a corpse and look at you.

39:27.046 --> 39:29.005
Hercule Poirot all over again.

39:34.880 --> 39:36.088
Baba the Rabbit?

39:36.921 --> 39:37.921
Poirot!

39:38.588 --> 39:39.963
How the hell?

39:49.338 --> 39:50.588
Baba the Rabbit?

39:51.546 --> 39:52.546
Are you sure?

39:53.796 --> 39:55.630
Under that mess of paintings?

39:55.630 --> 39:58.171
Where were you when Ms. Reynolds...?

39:58.171 --> 39:59.713
We were in the music room.

39:59.713 --> 40:01.046
And when was that?

40:01.046 --> 40:03.671
Midnight, just before.

40:04.546 --> 40:05.921
And then you came running?

40:07.171 --> 40:09.796
If I may ask, what is directly
above this balcony?

40:13.255 --> 40:15.463
The garden was
our secret hideaway.

40:17.255 --> 40:19.213
It was my daughter's favorite place.

40:20.005 --> 40:21.255
I let it all die.

40:23.088 --> 40:24.088
Our bees.

40:26.005 --> 40:27.046
We made honey.

40:28.046 --> 40:30.130
My daughter, she used to tease me.

40:30.796 --> 40:33.796
"All this effort
for a teaspoon of wildflower honey

40:33.796 --> 40:35.671
"that we can buy for six lira."

40:37.505 --> 40:39.546
I held hope they'd survive, but...

40:42.588 --> 40:43.588
Poor things.

40:45.213 --> 40:48.338
How did you come to invite
Ms. Reynolds to your home?

40:48.338 --> 40:50.213
Couldn't we get out of the rain for this?

40:50.213 --> 40:53.421
Oh, <i>mais non,</i> let us enjoy
this secret garden.

40:53.421 --> 40:55.880
Well, I read about her in a magazine.

40:55.880 --> 40:57.088
I didn't think much of it.

40:57.088 --> 41:00.296
And then, out of the blue
one day, she wrote to me.

41:01.005 --> 41:02.213
A letter from a stranger.

41:02.213 --> 41:04.713
But she would know you from the opera, no?

41:04.713 --> 41:06.880
But it was the name she used.

41:07.463 --> 41:09.963
She said that she heard
a message from Aspasia.

41:11.171 --> 41:12.421
That...

41:12.421 --> 41:14.796
That was a pet name
that she used to use for me.

41:14.796 --> 41:18.463
Aspasia, the great love
of the King of Pontus

41:18.463 --> 41:19.546
from <i>Mitridate.</i>

41:19.546 --> 41:20.880
It was Mozart's first opera.

41:20.880 --> 41:22.380
It was my first starring role.

41:23.338 --> 41:25.713
Alicia was born two months before, and...

41:28.213 --> 41:30.130
I found my voice because of her.

41:34.338 --> 41:35.713
And ever since,

41:37.213 --> 41:42.505
I can't sing without knowing
that she's waiting in my dressing room.

41:43.338 --> 41:44.338
I still can't.

41:44.338 --> 41:46.296
You will never perform again?

41:46.921 --> 41:49.171
There is no music without her.

41:51.005 --> 41:54.005
I turned down marriage proposals
without even a thought.

41:56.005 --> 41:59.088
She said yes to her first.

41:59.546 --> 42:01.880
To the charming chef Maxime Gerard.

42:02.338 --> 42:05.713
He is a pompous ass out to marry
the biggest purse he can find.

42:08.213 --> 42:09.713
When they got engaged,

42:11.380 --> 42:13.088
I tore out every flower in the garden

42:13.088 --> 42:14.963
and I got on a boat to Istanbul.

42:15.713 --> 42:18.796
But he must have found
that I wasn't as rich as he'd thought.

42:20.005 --> 42:21.921
One of the best days
of my life was when he said

42:21.921 --> 42:23.546
that he had met someone else.

42:23.546 --> 42:25.171
And that he called the whole thing off.

42:28.338 --> 42:31.380
But that's when the worst days started.

42:31.380 --> 42:32.588
Her illness.

42:33.546 --> 42:35.213
Her mind was on fire.

42:38.005 --> 42:40.713
She was like a little girl again.

42:45.421 --> 42:46.505
Thank you, Ms. Drake.

42:47.546 --> 42:48.546
Ms. Oliver.

42:55.255 --> 42:57.088
I'm a terrible housekeeper.

42:57.463 --> 42:58.796
I'm all she could get.

42:59.963 --> 43:01.255
Superstitious city.

43:02.255 --> 43:04.046
But you are superstitious, too.

43:04.046 --> 43:07.505
This palazzo you believe is haunted, yes?

43:08.505 --> 43:11.463
Ms. Rowena may own it,
but the spirits possess it.

43:11.463 --> 43:13.255
And where were you,
<i>Madame</i> Seminoff,

43:13.255 --> 43:17.713
when these murderous ghosts turned
Joyce Reynolds into one of their own?

43:18.296 --> 43:20.046
Make light, go on.

43:21.338 --> 43:23.296
Why do you ask all these questions?

43:23.796 --> 43:24.838
I did nothing wrong.

43:24.838 --> 43:27.296
It's what he does.
Or used to do.

43:27.963 --> 43:30.505
I'm helping him, you know,
he's back at it for the moment.

43:31.838 --> 43:32.838
It's going well.

43:33.421 --> 43:34.796
What is it that you do?

43:35.588 --> 43:36.796
What is it that I do?

43:37.421 --> 43:38.630
Um...

43:38.630 --> 43:40.671
When a crime has been committed,

43:40.671 --> 43:43.921
I can, by application of order and method

43:43.921 --> 43:46.630
and the slow extinguishing of my own soul,

43:46.630 --> 43:49.630
find without fail or doubt, whodunit.

43:50.255 --> 43:51.380
Like in your books,

43:51.713 --> 43:53.796
your silly detective from Finland,

43:53.796 --> 43:55.171
he's making lists.

43:56.963 --> 43:58.630
Do you base yourself on her writing?

43:59.880 --> 44:01.963
Would you mind telling us

44:01.963 --> 44:03.796
where you were at midnight?

44:03.796 --> 44:04.880
For the lists.

44:04.880 --> 44:07.505
In the music room with Ms. Rowena.

44:07.505 --> 44:10.921
And she joined you there at midnight.

44:10.921 --> 44:13.005
You are absolutely sure of this?

44:13.005 --> 44:16.171
I was watching the clock
and was grateful that she did.

44:16.171 --> 44:18.963
But you did not approve
of the fortune teller.

44:19.546 --> 44:24.046
I believe you called her "satanic." Um...

44:24.046 --> 44:28.755
Your mind goes, perhaps to, um, Exodus

44:29.463 --> 44:30.755
22:18?

44:33.796 --> 44:36.755
"Do not suffer a sorceress to live."

44:36.755 --> 44:38.755
The Bible warns against it with reason.

44:39.130 --> 44:42.213
- A witch on her Sabbath, huh?
- Oh.

44:42.213 --> 44:44.171
To be drowned or burned

44:44.171 --> 44:46.380
or thrown off a high balcony?

44:46.380 --> 44:47.588
No, I am no vigilante.

44:47.588 --> 44:49.171
But your scripture is keen.

44:49.171 --> 44:51.671
No less than a strict Vulgate Latin.

44:51.671 --> 44:53.755
Not the product of a parochial school,

44:53.755 --> 44:58.171
but perhaps a convent.

45:03.088 --> 45:06.046
I found my call to be a nun
before I could read.

45:07.546 --> 45:11.380
I wore the habit nine years
at <i>Ospedale della Pietà.</i>

45:14.421 --> 45:15.463
And then...

45:17.296 --> 45:19.130
And then I met Mr. Seminoff.

45:19.130 --> 45:20.796
He came to fix the roof.

45:24.171 --> 45:25.546
God sets challenges.

45:25.546 --> 45:27.296
You fell in love and forgot God.

45:27.296 --> 45:28.796
No, it's not that simple.

45:29.671 --> 45:30.796
One final question.

45:30.796 --> 45:33.838
For the lists, of course. Um...

45:48.296 --> 45:50.921
<i>Pardon,</i> I believed I heard something.

45:52.296 --> 45:54.713
You who fear the dark arts so,

45:54.880 --> 45:57.630
why would you even attend a séance?

45:58.463 --> 46:02.046
An abominated act here at night,
when you are loath to remain?

46:04.213 --> 46:06.130
There's only one to whom I must answer.

46:08.838 --> 46:09.921
And that is not you.

46:23.213 --> 46:24.213
Poirot.

46:33.671 --> 46:37.546
Mrs. Olga Seminoff, as a nun,
what was your saint's name?

46:38.630 --> 46:39.630
Maria.

46:49.088 --> 46:51.171
You won't get far on a broken leg.

46:58.380 --> 47:00.421
Jagged weapon. Not too sharp.

47:02.255 --> 47:03.255
Nails, maybe.

47:03.255 --> 47:05.505
And no other marks on her.

47:05.505 --> 47:07.421
Other than the obvious.

47:08.255 --> 47:09.505
- Oh.

47:15.796 --> 47:18.463
Nothing else unusual
about her condition?

47:19.338 --> 47:21.505
Impaled on classical art
might be enough.

47:22.421 --> 47:24.296
But what of the left wrist?

47:24.421 --> 47:26.171
You ignore an injury,

47:26.588 --> 47:29.046
as well as the precise time of death.

47:39.046 --> 47:40.046
Missed that.

47:43.338 --> 47:44.338
You're staring at me.

47:46.963 --> 47:47.963
Stop!

47:49.046 --> 47:50.380
You think I'm a loony?

47:50.880 --> 47:51.880
I'm not!

47:52.671 --> 47:53.671
Dad.

47:56.630 --> 47:57.713
Are you all right?

47:59.630 --> 48:00.630
Yeah.

48:01.130 --> 48:02.588
Just up here if you need me.

48:03.088 --> 48:04.088
Mmm-hmm.

48:09.963 --> 48:11.505
Really wish you hadn't asked me.

48:13.005 --> 48:15.588
Battle scars are not always of the body.

48:17.255 --> 48:18.255
You served?

48:21.713 --> 48:24.130
15th of April, '45.

48:25.213 --> 48:27.171
It was all supposed to be over.

48:28.463 --> 48:30.171
We crossed the Rhine,

48:30.671 --> 48:32.505
east in the push for Berlin.

48:34.796 --> 48:37.130
Found the gates at the camp
at Bergen-Belsen.

48:37.130 --> 48:38.296
Oh, God.

48:38.796 --> 48:39.880
"Liberating."

48:40.796 --> 48:44.255
Nursing skeletons back to life.

48:46.046 --> 48:49.338
We killed two the first day with milk.
We didn't know.

48:51.046 --> 48:52.296
Then typhus.

48:53.880 --> 48:55.463
All we had was aspirin and opium.

48:58.796 --> 49:00.421
We burned down the huts.

49:05.046 --> 49:06.421
I wrote Leo a letter.

49:09.588 --> 49:11.880
And then shot myself through the chest.

49:16.755 --> 49:19.338
I was told to stop practicing
when I got home.

49:19.546 --> 49:23.546
Except for one patient last year.

49:24.046 --> 49:25.130
Alicia Drake.

49:26.505 --> 49:27.963
A favor to Rowena.

49:30.838 --> 49:32.296
Nobody else would see her.

49:32.963 --> 49:33.963
Not here.

49:35.588 --> 49:38.130
I'd been her family doctor so long,
I should have said no.

49:38.130 --> 49:40.505
But you were at a disadvantage there.

49:41.713 --> 49:44.088
Because you are in love with Rowena Drake.

49:44.588 --> 49:46.338
Lucky to be in her life at all.

49:48.421 --> 49:49.463
I...

49:49.963 --> 49:51.505
I know this has been...

49:56.171 --> 50:00.505
I know this has been difficult,
but in your opinion,

50:01.171 --> 50:02.921
could Alicia Drake have been murdered?

50:04.005 --> 50:05.963
Alicia told me what she saw.

50:07.088 --> 50:09.463
She said the children were taunting her.

50:09.963 --> 50:11.130
I didn't listen.

50:11.130 --> 50:12.671
I wrote it off as a broken heart

50:12.671 --> 50:14.130
when she was going mad.

50:15.963 --> 50:17.296
She needed help.

50:19.213 --> 50:20.880
I gave her sedatives,

50:22.338 --> 50:24.588
like milk to the starving.

50:25.755 --> 50:28.046
There is no such thing
as psychic phenomena.

50:28.046 --> 50:30.796
There is psychic pain.

50:32.630 --> 50:34.505
A loony like me should have known.

50:39.213 --> 50:40.296
Are we through?

50:41.213 --> 50:42.213
Hmm.

50:47.505 --> 50:48.630
Um...

50:49.130 --> 50:50.463
<i>Merci,</i> Doctor Ferrier.

52:05.171 --> 52:06.963
I suppose I'm nowhere on your list.

52:08.588 --> 52:10.046
Of who to interview.

52:11.463 --> 52:12.963
I'll wait, sir.

52:14.130 --> 52:16.838
The terrifying Edgar Allan Poe.

52:17.338 --> 52:19.921
For a boy your age, it is not better

52:19.921 --> 52:22.171
perhaps, Charles Dickens?

52:22.171 --> 52:24.171
He's a bit silly. Don't you think?

52:27.505 --> 52:29.213
My father's jumpy like you.

52:29.921 --> 52:32.963
They call it war neurosis. Battle fatigue.

52:33.838 --> 52:35.130
I think that's unfair.

52:36.046 --> 52:37.255
He's not tired.

52:37.796 --> 52:38.796
He's broken.

52:40.505 --> 52:42.296
He was with me at midnight,
if you were wondering.

52:44.005 --> 52:46.796
I was wondering, I admit.

52:46.796 --> 52:48.046
With you at midnight, yes?

52:48.046 --> 52:50.046
In the kitchen, waiting for Ms. Rowena.

52:51.005 --> 52:52.338
He wanted to say good night.

52:52.338 --> 52:53.505
Of course.

52:53.963 --> 52:56.088
Her assistants came in just after,

52:56.088 --> 52:58.088
so they're still on your list.

52:58.713 --> 53:01.130
- Everyone is on my list.

53:01.546 --> 53:02.796
You left on the taps.

53:04.505 --> 53:05.505
Oh, I...

53:10.463 --> 53:13.671
I am afraid, I do not know myself tonight.

53:14.255 --> 53:15.421
You're feeling things.

53:15.713 --> 53:16.713
Hmm?

53:17.088 --> 53:18.088
Voices.

53:19.588 --> 53:21.130
It's All Hallows' Eve.

53:22.380 --> 53:25.171
The dead are as close as they can be.

53:26.921 --> 53:28.505
You were dead, too, sir.

53:29.796 --> 53:31.630
Even if only for a moment.

53:33.088 --> 53:34.963
They see you as one of their own.

53:35.755 --> 53:39.046
One with something to say
would be wise to come to you.

53:40.213 --> 53:42.255
You talk like Ms. Reynolds.

53:42.255 --> 53:44.130
She only pretended to know.

53:45.338 --> 53:46.921
No wonder they got cross with her.

53:47.338 --> 53:49.421
You have much sympathy with the dead.

53:49.421 --> 53:51.296
Some of them are my friends.

53:53.671 --> 53:54.671
Excuse me.

53:57.171 --> 53:58.713
<i>Merci, Monsieur</i> Leopold.

53:58.713 --> 53:59.796
You're welcome.

54:02.421 --> 54:03.421
Hercules.

54:07.046 --> 54:08.046
Jumpy.

54:08.046 --> 54:10.546
Nicholas and Desdemona are ready.

54:12.963 --> 54:14.213
We can wait for the police.

54:14.630 --> 54:16.421
- I am Hercule Poirot, no?
- No.

54:16.421 --> 54:17.921
- Yes. Yes.
- Yes.

54:17.921 --> 54:19.588
If the police can succeed where I cannot,

54:19.588 --> 54:21.755
I will be the next one off
the balcony into the canal.

54:21.755 --> 54:23.421
Back to his old self.

54:23.421 --> 54:24.838
- What do you think so far?
- Well...

54:24.838 --> 54:26.046
My money's on the housekeeper.

54:26.046 --> 54:28.213
Good taste in books,
but brimstone fire burns hot.

54:28.213 --> 54:30.421
And Rowena Drake needed the victim alive.

54:30.796 --> 54:32.171
Although that little boy,

54:32.796 --> 54:34.546
all the charm of chewing tinfoil.

54:34.546 --> 54:35.630
Perhaps, perhaps.

54:35.630 --> 54:39.171
Every theory aspires to fact
before the information is gathered.

54:39.171 --> 54:40.255
Order and method.

54:40.255 --> 54:41.588
- And lists.
- And lists.

54:41.588 --> 54:43.838
We continue to those
who knew her best, her assistants.

54:43.838 --> 54:45.588
Do you really think the help had motive?

54:45.588 --> 54:46.838
The help always have motive,

54:46.838 --> 54:48.796
first having to endure
to be called "the help."

54:53.546 --> 54:54.963
Him again.

54:54.963 --> 54:56.755
Those two criminals are not to be trusted.

54:56.755 --> 54:59.421
Criminals? Those children?
You might have mentioned that.

54:59.421 --> 55:00.755
I'm telling you now.

55:08.921 --> 55:10.463
Couldn't I do this with my sister?

55:10.921 --> 55:13.046
Uh, she waits for you comfortably.

55:13.380 --> 55:14.380
Where is my brother?

55:14.380 --> 55:16.130
He waits for you comfortably.

55:16.130 --> 55:18.838
Desdemona and Nicholas Holland.

55:18.838 --> 55:20.463
Our passports are forgeries.

55:20.463 --> 55:21.755
Yes. And not very good ones.

55:21.755 --> 55:24.255
Horvát Nipkin and Dorenia before.

55:24.838 --> 55:26.171
- Born in Hungary.

55:26.171 --> 55:28.296
Village burned out of existence.

55:28.755 --> 55:30.421
Of all our family,

55:30.963 --> 55:32.755
somehow we were still alive.

55:33.296 --> 55:34.421
We took care of each other.

55:34.421 --> 55:37.588
At midnight, we snuck a drink
in the kitchen.

55:38.338 --> 55:39.630
The creepy kid was there.

55:39.630 --> 55:41.671
He has you coming in
just after the hour.

55:41.671 --> 55:42.796
He is mistaken.

55:42.796 --> 55:45.005
And how long were you
in Ms. Reynolds' employ?

55:45.005 --> 55:46.671
- Just over a year.
You sure?

55:46.671 --> 55:47.880
The best year we ever had.

55:47.880 --> 55:50.588
We haven't been hungry
since we started fronting for her.

55:50.588 --> 55:52.213
I don't know what we'll do without her.

55:52.213 --> 55:54.421
- We managed before her.
- Oh, yes, you stole.

55:54.796 --> 55:56.546
We were thieves, not murderers.

55:56.546 --> 55:58.130
We did what we had to survive the war.

55:58.130 --> 55:59.296
She just knew things.

55:59.296 --> 56:01.755
And if she says Alicia Drake
was murdered...

56:02.046 --> 56:03.046
Pure phony.

56:03.046 --> 56:04.213
She was magic.

56:04.963 --> 56:07.671
So, all of these séance
in which you participated...

56:07.671 --> 56:09.130
It was fake. Fake.
- Fake?

56:09.130 --> 56:10.880
- They were fake, the spirit meetings?
- It was all fake.

56:10.880 --> 56:12.796
- All of the séances?
- It was all a show.

56:12.796 --> 56:14.921
All a show, a fake. Mmm, strange.

56:14.921 --> 56:16.671
And is this magic too?

56:16.671 --> 56:18.630
The control for your talking typewriter?

56:19.380 --> 56:21.088
I mean, we'd set some tricks.

56:21.088 --> 56:23.463
Only to drive home
the reality of her visions.

56:24.088 --> 56:25.963
She ordered me around like a duchess

56:25.963 --> 56:28.630
and flirted with Nicholas
to keep him in line.

56:29.380 --> 56:30.588
We have put up with worse.

56:30.588 --> 56:33.505
"We'll get there without her."

56:34.005 --> 56:35.630
Where were you running off to?

56:35.630 --> 56:37.755
- We're going to Missouri.
- Missouri.

56:37.755 --> 56:38.838
Missouri?

56:39.505 --> 56:41.963
We were hiding in the Murrhardt Forest.

56:42.463 --> 56:44.921
Living on weeds and mice.

56:45.421 --> 56:47.088
The American trucks,
they came through Heilbronn

56:47.088 --> 56:48.963
and I thought we're dead
when they caught us.

56:48.963 --> 56:51.088
They taught us the Lindy Hop.

56:51.588 --> 56:53.630
We'd never seen anything like them before.

56:54.130 --> 56:57.380
This mix of men,
their colors and their voices.

56:58.421 --> 57:00.338
One of them tacked up this sheet.

57:00.338 --> 57:03.130
They had a film projector,
but only half a movie.

57:03.546 --> 57:08.796
We used to watch
half of <i>Meet Me in St. Louis</i>

57:08.796 --> 57:11.796
every night on an army sheet for a month.

57:11.796 --> 57:14.421
We watched it over and over.

57:15.255 --> 57:16.671
I still don't how it ends.

57:16.671 --> 57:18.505
Oh, it's a...

57:18.505 --> 57:20.505
It ends happily.

57:21.005 --> 57:22.796
"St. Louis, Missouri."

57:24.380 --> 57:26.963
Just saying those words
could get my sister to fall asleep.

57:27.505 --> 57:28.713
It was the color.

57:30.255 --> 57:31.921
It was the beautiful people.

57:31.921 --> 57:34.005
You know, it was, no one was sick.

57:34.338 --> 57:37.296
No one was starving or dying.

57:38.796 --> 57:41.338
5135 Kensington Avenue.

57:42.713 --> 57:44.338
That's where we decided to live.

57:45.380 --> 57:47.505
It's her dream so it's mine too.

57:47.505 --> 57:51.671
We only had to endure the duchess
until we had enough to buy our way in.

57:52.213 --> 57:53.338
And start over.

57:54.296 --> 57:55.921
Stupid to have a dream.

57:56.630 --> 57:57.921
But impatient with your dream,

57:57.921 --> 58:00.380
you grew brazen
and skimmed from her proceeds.

58:01.130 --> 58:03.046
"Clang, clang, clang, went the trolley."

58:03.046 --> 58:04.338
What? No, we didn't.

58:04.338 --> 58:07.005
- Your brother already admits that you did.
- Idiot.

58:07.005 --> 58:08.588
Your sister already admits that you did.

58:08.588 --> 58:10.796
Not from Ms. Reynolds. We wouldn't.

58:10.796 --> 58:13.838
Perhaps she discovered
your theft and made threats.

58:13.838 --> 58:15.796
Perhaps you had had enough experience

58:15.796 --> 58:18.505
of the police's cruel treatment
of stateless Romani urchins,

58:18.671 --> 58:21.671
and, wishing to avoid deportation,
or worse, killed her.

58:21.671 --> 58:22.963
You, the trusted help.

58:27.296 --> 58:28.380
Nicholas!

58:28.505 --> 58:29.713
Nicholas, where are you?

58:33.588 --> 58:35.421
If I'm trapped here, so are you.

58:43.213 --> 58:44.755
Doesn't mean that I killed her.

58:44.755 --> 58:46.546
Damn well ran like she did.

58:46.546 --> 58:49.046
Clear motive, both unaccounted
for at her time of death.

58:49.046 --> 58:50.171
I'm changing my guess.

58:50.171 --> 58:53.213
It is certainly possible. Yes. Yes.

58:54.171 --> 58:55.671
You're doing that thing
where you pretend to know

58:55.671 --> 58:56.880
more than everyone else in the world.

58:56.880 --> 58:57.963
I as yet know nothing.

58:57.963 --> 59:00.380
The truth does not come
without a tax of effort.

59:01.380 --> 59:04.588
You woke the bear from his sleep.
You cannot cry when he tangos.

59:04.588 --> 59:06.171
That's not an expression in any language.

59:06.171 --> 59:07.338
We continue.

59:18.421 --> 59:19.588
Can you hear this?

59:20.838 --> 59:21.880
All around us.

59:22.796 --> 59:23.921
I heard nothing.

59:25.755 --> 59:28.005
Your investigator
has poached his egg.

59:29.546 --> 59:30.880
Poirot.

59:30.880 --> 59:33.546
A bang to the head might be
your limit for tonight.

59:34.630 --> 59:36.213
Someone else is in this house.

59:38.963 --> 59:40.130
Did you hear it?

59:41.463 --> 59:42.463
Yes.

59:43.463 --> 59:44.588
Me and you, then.

59:46.755 --> 59:48.421
Listening.

59:51.255 --> 59:52.255
Wait.

01:00:09.796 --> 01:00:10.796
Still dead.

01:00:56.588 --> 01:00:59.421
It is all right.
You can come out now.

01:01:07.296 --> 01:01:09.171
You're not in any trouble.

01:01:10.713 --> 01:01:12.296
There is nothing to fear.

01:01:13.130 --> 01:01:15.546
You came with the other children, yes?

01:01:17.171 --> 01:01:20.963
And you have been
hiding here all this time.

01:01:27.046 --> 01:01:28.671
Did you hear the woman fall?

01:01:33.380 --> 01:01:34.505
Did you see?

01:01:36.963 --> 01:01:38.213
Did someone push her?

01:01:40.130 --> 01:01:41.796
- Who are you talking to?

01:01:41.796 --> 01:01:43.713
- A child.

01:01:46.963 --> 01:01:47.963
You must have heard.

01:01:50.505 --> 01:01:51.630
That I heard.

01:01:59.796 --> 01:02:00.796
Let us go!

01:02:00.796 --> 01:02:03.005
Untie us, you pig!

01:02:03.005 --> 01:02:04.088
You can't leave us here!

01:02:08.463 --> 01:02:10.838
- You heard that. You all...
Must be the pipes.

01:02:10.838 --> 01:02:12.421
Pipes? It sounds like the Blitz.

01:02:12.421 --> 01:02:14.463
In all my years here,
I've never heard this.

01:02:14.463 --> 01:02:16.296
I have. When they're angry.

01:02:16.296 --> 01:02:17.421
We've upset them.

01:02:17.421 --> 01:02:19.838
How do we un-upset them?

01:02:19.838 --> 01:02:20.921
Listen.

01:02:26.171 --> 01:02:27.796
It comes from the basement.

01:02:30.671 --> 01:02:32.630
There is no basement in this house.

01:02:58.713 --> 01:03:01.505
<i>"Dottore."</i> Doctor.
The Children's Vendetta.

01:03:02.130 --> 01:03:03.546
You wanna go down into that?

01:03:24.421 --> 01:03:26.130
<i>All over the world</i>

01:03:26.755 --> 01:03:28.713
Dad?
<i>- The boys are home again</i>

01:03:44.505 --> 01:03:47.296
They really did lock
those children in here to die.

01:03:48.421 --> 01:03:50.796
Leave him. He's having a nerve storm.

01:03:50.796 --> 01:03:52.713
Damn it, Ferrier. Not now!

01:03:52.713 --> 01:03:53.796
Pull it together.

01:03:54.213 --> 01:03:55.296
Think of your son.

01:03:56.671 --> 01:03:58.380
Oh!

01:03:58.380 --> 01:04:00.296
- Stop it!
Dad!

01:04:00.296 --> 01:04:01.463
Stop it! Stop it!

01:04:09.088 --> 01:04:11.046
Storm waves. Not ghosts.

01:04:11.588 --> 01:04:13.296
Please, stop it!
Stop!

01:04:14.588 --> 01:04:15.671
Dad!

01:04:22.255 --> 01:04:23.505
Oh. Stop it.

01:04:28.380 --> 01:04:29.380
Dad, stop it!

01:04:29.380 --> 01:04:30.713
Are you all right? You all right?

01:04:31.963 --> 01:04:33.255
Dad, please, stop!

01:04:33.255 --> 01:04:34.880
Stop it!
Please, stop!

01:04:42.380 --> 01:04:44.838
- Dad. Dad.

01:04:46.380 --> 01:04:48.380
- Dad. It's me.

01:04:49.088 --> 01:04:50.088
It's me.

01:04:51.838 --> 01:04:52.963
I'm right here.

01:04:57.713 --> 01:04:59.005
You're here with me.

01:05:00.796 --> 01:05:01.796
You see me?

01:05:02.338 --> 01:05:03.338
You see me?

01:05:18.380 --> 01:05:19.671
It's just a thing.

01:05:20.046 --> 01:05:21.046
I know.

01:05:26.213 --> 01:05:28.005
<i>- Stronzo!</i>

01:05:28.588 --> 01:05:30.046
Shh, Dad.

01:05:33.171 --> 01:05:34.880
It's okay. Dad.

01:05:35.546 --> 01:05:36.796
Just needs his rest.

01:05:38.130 --> 01:05:39.171
Don't you, Dad?

01:05:39.671 --> 01:05:41.630
I should be taking care of you.

01:05:41.630 --> 01:05:42.713
You do.

01:05:51.046 --> 01:05:52.046
Rest, <i>monsieur.</i>

01:05:53.421 --> 01:05:54.838
I should have listened.

01:05:55.171 --> 01:05:56.171
I saw.

01:05:56.713 --> 01:05:58.630
Demons, evil,

01:05:58.630 --> 01:06:01.130
they're everywhere in this house.

01:06:01.130 --> 01:06:04.755
You and me, we're the same.

01:06:06.838 --> 01:06:08.296
Wherever we go,

01:06:09.921 --> 01:06:11.088
death follows.

01:06:11.088 --> 01:06:13.963
There must be a rational
answer for all of this.

01:06:14.463 --> 01:06:16.463
In the basement, there are bees.

01:06:17.296 --> 01:06:19.630
Upstairs, there is an ordinary killer.

01:06:19.630 --> 01:06:20.713
No.

01:06:21.296 --> 01:06:23.213
- Listen.

01:06:25.630 --> 01:06:26.630
Believe.

01:06:38.963 --> 01:06:40.963
He can rest now in my music room.

01:06:40.963 --> 01:06:42.838
It's almost soundproof.

01:06:46.296 --> 01:06:48.171
We should lock it. For his safety.

01:06:49.380 --> 01:06:52.255
But please, you keep the key. For ours.

01:06:54.338 --> 01:06:55.421
<i>Merci.</i>

01:07:01.088 --> 01:07:02.171
Come on, Leopold.

01:07:02.921 --> 01:07:04.296
It's time for more cake, don't you think?

01:07:04.296 --> 01:07:06.505
I've had too much.
Well, I haven't.

01:07:14.588 --> 01:07:16.130
Of course, she'd say that.

01:07:17.130 --> 01:07:20.046
From her perspective,
it's true, I did kill Alicia.

01:07:20.588 --> 01:07:22.796
Rowena believes what she wants.

01:07:23.921 --> 01:07:27.088
A medium saw Alicia murdered,
color me the gunman.

01:07:27.088 --> 01:07:29.005
You do not believe Ms. Reynolds,

01:07:29.005 --> 01:07:33.796
her typewriter with the message
from the departed of your initial.

01:07:34.546 --> 01:07:36.046
"M" for Maxime.

01:07:36.046 --> 01:07:37.380
A haunted house?

01:07:38.296 --> 01:07:41.296
Humans are so desperate
to shape chaos into tidy stories,

01:07:41.463 --> 01:07:42.921
double that in distress.

01:07:44.046 --> 01:07:47.255
It isn't a wash of a trillion stars,
it's ol' Cassiopeia.

01:07:47.255 --> 01:07:51.088
That blur of light in the family photo?
That must be Grandad's ghost.

01:07:51.088 --> 01:07:53.546
- Hmm.
- Alicia was mentally ill.

01:07:54.380 --> 01:07:55.921
It killed her.

01:07:55.921 --> 01:07:57.046
It didn't have to.

01:07:57.046 --> 01:07:59.130
A proper doctor would have
treated her properly.

01:07:59.130 --> 01:08:00.963
- Not that twitch salad.

01:08:01.546 --> 01:08:02.713
- Shit!

01:08:08.338 --> 01:08:11.421
Honey. Good on a cut. Ancient antiseptic.

01:08:17.963 --> 01:08:19.546
That's not wildflower.

01:08:21.130 --> 01:08:22.130
I can't place it.

01:08:23.963 --> 01:08:24.963
Oh!

01:08:29.505 --> 01:08:32.171
Ah. Alicia Drake.

01:08:32.171 --> 01:08:35.546
Such sunshine happiness.

01:08:37.796 --> 01:08:38.796
Torn in two.

01:08:39.546 --> 01:08:43.421
Alicia tore up the photo in her room
the night I ended it.

01:08:45.255 --> 01:08:46.588
It's the last time we spoke.

01:08:47.838 --> 01:08:50.380
So, you did break off
your engagement.

01:08:51.963 --> 01:08:54.380
You heard. She wasn't rich enough for me.

01:08:54.380 --> 01:08:58.380
You carry her photograph in your pocket.
You came tonight when summoned.

01:08:58.380 --> 01:09:01.755
I believe that you loved Alicia Drake
more than the money.

01:09:02.255 --> 01:09:03.380
And yet, you walked away.

01:09:03.380 --> 01:09:06.588
Some women, you marry them,
you marry their mother, too.

01:09:06.588 --> 01:09:08.463
So, the mother did not approve of you.

01:09:08.463 --> 01:09:10.380
She wouldn't approve of the Pope.

01:09:11.838 --> 01:09:14.880
Rowena didn't know how to exist alone.

01:09:14.880 --> 01:09:16.921
Tore up the garden in spite,
took off abroad.

01:09:17.130 --> 01:09:18.130
Alicia was all twisted with guilt,

01:09:18.130 --> 01:09:20.255
wanted to chase her around the world.

01:09:20.255 --> 01:09:22.880
And I finally realized

01:09:22.880 --> 01:09:25.421
I would never be the most
important thing in her life.

01:09:25.838 --> 01:09:27.921
So, you broke it off and broke her heart.

01:09:27.921 --> 01:09:30.463
All because a woman made you feel small.

01:09:31.171 --> 01:09:33.213
I returned to Venice

01:09:33.213 --> 01:09:35.338
to beg her to take me back.

01:09:38.088 --> 01:09:39.880
When I heard she was sick,

01:09:40.921 --> 01:09:42.921
Rowena wouldn't let me see her.

01:09:43.546 --> 01:09:45.130
Or show her my letters.

01:09:47.755 --> 01:09:50.130
The next time I saw Alicia
was in a coffin.

01:09:57.338 --> 01:09:58.755
Maybe it was my fault.

01:10:03.380 --> 01:10:06.171
If you will permit,
your invitation, please?

01:10:12.380 --> 01:10:13.380
Ms. Oliver.

01:10:17.213 --> 01:10:18.463
A simple note.

01:10:18.463 --> 01:10:20.546
No distinguishing language.

01:10:20.546 --> 01:10:24.755
The stationery is plain.
It is cleanly typewritten.

01:10:25.213 --> 01:10:27.255
Professionally anonymous.

01:10:42.463 --> 01:10:44.421
Well, that's it. You're done. Let's go.

01:10:58.380 --> 01:11:00.588
His interview. We did not finish.

01:11:00.588 --> 01:11:03.671
You were gonna
expose some lie he told,

01:11:03.671 --> 01:11:05.880
probably accuse him
of being secretly Vichy.

01:11:05.880 --> 01:11:08.630
Then, he would have threatened
to deck you. Effort spared.

01:11:08.630 --> 01:11:09.713
Is he all right?

01:11:09.713 --> 01:11:11.713
Guard dog, be useful, get him a chair.

01:11:11.713 --> 01:11:14.713
A chair, yes.

01:11:14.713 --> 01:11:16.963
It is good to have a friend in this.

01:11:18.046 --> 01:11:19.963
How long have we known each other?

01:11:20.838 --> 01:11:23.380
The Canning Road Municipal Baths Murder.

01:11:23.380 --> 01:11:24.963
- Ah.
-  I bullied my way

01:11:24.963 --> 01:11:26.963
into observing you as research for a book.

01:11:26.963 --> 01:11:28.421
Wrote Poirot thinly veiled.

01:11:28.421 --> 01:11:30.671
They saw through it, and you got famous.

01:11:30.671 --> 01:11:32.921
- Infamous.
- Ah.

01:11:32.921 --> 01:11:34.963
Excuse me. Thank you.

01:11:37.713 --> 01:11:38.755
<i>Dottore.</i>
- Thank you.

01:11:38.755 --> 01:11:40.755
Not for me. For you.

01:11:42.838 --> 01:11:44.588
You want to interview me?

01:11:44.588 --> 01:11:45.671
Leave him be.

01:11:45.671 --> 01:11:48.255
You turned on a cold engine,
took a few knocks to the head.

01:11:48.255 --> 01:11:50.630
Sit this one out. Let morning come.

01:11:54.130 --> 01:11:55.463
I almost died.

01:11:56.505 --> 01:11:57.505
Here.

01:11:59.588 --> 01:12:01.255
This palazzo,

01:12:02.213 --> 01:12:03.296
it, uh, plays tricks.

01:12:04.921 --> 01:12:08.796
It puts things in front of me
again and again.

01:12:08.796 --> 01:12:09.921
Um...

01:12:09.921 --> 01:12:11.171
Apples.

01:12:11.171 --> 01:12:12.380
A trick of the mind.

01:12:12.380 --> 01:12:16.046
And then my mind wishes
to tell me something.

01:12:16.046 --> 01:12:19.046
Uh, how did you become a policeman?

01:12:19.046 --> 01:12:21.838
I do wish you would let go of this.

01:12:21.838 --> 01:12:23.671
It's all right. I'll answer.

01:12:24.421 --> 01:12:26.588
- My father was a cop.

01:12:26.588 --> 01:12:28.213
Family business, basically.

01:12:28.880 --> 01:12:29.963
Never knew anything else.

01:12:29.963 --> 01:12:32.921
Yet, you retired early. Only last year.

01:12:33.380 --> 01:12:34.380
Yeah.

01:12:35.046 --> 01:12:36.963
The family business was no longer for me.

01:12:36.963 --> 01:12:38.505
Perhaps never was.

01:12:39.213 --> 01:12:41.296
I had the strength, but not the skin.

01:12:42.630 --> 01:12:46.505
I drank when I couldn't sleep
and I never slept.

01:12:48.338 --> 01:12:49.630
You were a policeman once.

01:12:50.546 --> 01:12:51.630
You can understand.

01:12:52.296 --> 01:12:54.255
Eventually, you get a case,

01:12:54.255 --> 01:12:57.796
and you know it is the last one
you can stomach and still know your soul.

01:12:58.671 --> 01:13:00.338
What case was it for you?

01:13:02.505 --> 01:13:05.171
Why did you lie about
never having been here before

01:13:05.171 --> 01:13:06.630
when clearly you had?

01:13:07.588 --> 01:13:11.130
You knew precisely where
to find the hidden telephone.

01:13:13.505 --> 01:13:15.588
The case was such a spectacle.

01:13:16.088 --> 01:13:18.296
The family deserved their privacy.

01:13:18.713 --> 01:13:22.921
But you were the policeman on duty

01:13:22.921 --> 01:13:25.213
when Alicia Drake was found dead.

01:13:25.880 --> 01:13:26.880
Yes.

01:13:28.255 --> 01:13:30.796
<i>I pulled her from the water.</i>

01:13:33.171 --> 01:13:34.463
Retired next day.

01:13:34.463 --> 01:13:39.088
Soon to become my excellent bodyguard,
the dragon at my gate,

01:13:39.088 --> 01:13:42.213
who not once permitted a soul to pass.

01:13:42.213 --> 01:13:45.588
Yet only this morning, interrupted me

01:13:45.588 --> 01:13:48.505
to ask if I indeed knew
the woman with the apples.

01:13:49.963 --> 01:13:51.963
So many months, my peace undisturbed,

01:13:51.963 --> 01:13:55.713
you resolutely guarding me
from curiosity or company,

01:13:55.713 --> 01:13:58.130
grown men cast into the canal.

01:13:59.005 --> 01:14:00.463
Ariadne Oliver

01:14:01.213 --> 01:14:02.713
waltzes through.

01:14:03.255 --> 01:14:04.255
Why?

01:14:07.213 --> 01:14:08.755
Because you were in league.

01:14:11.046 --> 01:14:13.130
The authoress and the bodyguard

01:14:13.130 --> 01:14:15.713
working with the medium, in the cahoot.

01:14:17.046 --> 01:14:18.796
<i>Feigning disdain,</i>

01:14:18.796 --> 01:14:22.296
<i>conspiring to bring me to this
séance to make me a fool.</i>

01:14:23.255 --> 01:14:24.755
I'm very worried about you.

01:14:24.755 --> 01:14:28.505
Details of Alicia Drake's life and death

01:14:28.505 --> 01:14:31.963
provided by the policeman
who was present at her death.

01:14:31.963 --> 01:14:35.921
Details of me provided not by divination,

01:14:35.921 --> 01:14:37.630
but by letter from you.

01:14:37.630 --> 01:14:39.796
And at the séance,
with all eyes on the medium,

01:14:39.796 --> 01:14:43.255
<i>your own hands were free.
The secret accomplice</i>

01:14:43.255 --> 01:14:46.171
<i>to make me believe the impossible.</i>

01:14:48.880 --> 01:14:50.630
<i>Mediums and magic.</i>

01:14:50.630 --> 01:14:52.463
<i>Ghosts and gods.</i>

01:14:52.463 --> 01:14:53.963
<i>Fame for the medium,</i>

01:14:53.963 --> 01:14:55.213
a percentage to you,

01:14:55.213 --> 01:14:57.838
your literary standing restored.

01:14:57.838 --> 01:15:00.005
"The woman who stumped Hercule Poirot."

01:15:00.005 --> 01:15:04.380
Not Joyce Reynolds but Ariadne Oliver.

01:15:10.630 --> 01:15:11.963
Won't you forgive me?

01:15:11.963 --> 01:15:14.171
Apparently, only God can forgive.

01:15:15.046 --> 01:15:16.130
Bit of a pickle then.

01:15:16.130 --> 01:15:19.130
So, let us discover how you did it.

01:15:19.130 --> 01:15:20.838
- Baba?
- A good touch.

01:15:20.838 --> 01:15:22.963
The personal invitation to the fiancé?

01:15:22.963 --> 01:15:27.838
Guaranteed drama with that one.
Three flops, I needed a win.

01:15:27.838 --> 01:15:29.213
We were friends.

01:15:29.213 --> 01:15:31.921
You don't have friends, you have admirers.

01:15:31.921 --> 01:15:33.880
And you only have them because of me.

01:15:33.880 --> 01:15:35.630
I wrote you up as a genius.

01:15:35.630 --> 01:15:38.421
Why shouldn't I use you to sell books?

01:15:38.421 --> 01:15:41.796
Genius. You're a fool. An ego.

01:15:41.796 --> 01:15:44.505
A black cloud that lures death.

01:15:45.171 --> 01:15:47.005
And you know it, too. That's why you quit.

01:15:47.005 --> 01:15:49.171
Is this why you killed Joyce Reynolds?

01:15:49.171 --> 01:15:51.296
No. I did not.

01:15:51.296 --> 01:15:53.505
Your book an instant legend.

01:15:53.505 --> 01:15:55.338
Come on, you're tap dancing now.

01:15:55.338 --> 01:15:57.463
Working together...
- We didn't.

01:15:57.463 --> 01:15:59.046
...to conceal murder!

01:16:00.005 --> 01:16:01.380
The key, come quick!

01:16:01.380 --> 01:16:02.463
There's someone else in there!

01:16:02.463 --> 01:16:03.880
Hurry up! Hurry up with it!

01:16:04.255 --> 01:16:05.255
Poirot!

01:16:05.255 --> 01:16:07.255
What happened?
What's wrong with him?

01:16:07.255 --> 01:16:08.505
I don't know.

01:16:56.171 --> 01:16:58.046
Why did he have to be alone?

01:17:00.755 --> 01:17:02.046
This is the only way in.

01:17:03.130 --> 01:17:04.505
You had the only key.

01:17:04.505 --> 01:17:06.588
Not possible.

01:17:09.963 --> 01:17:11.171
No.

01:17:11.171 --> 01:17:13.421
No, I was right in front of you!

01:17:15.046 --> 01:17:16.713
He was shouting at someone.

01:17:19.546 --> 01:17:21.630
I hated him but I didn't want him dead.

01:17:21.630 --> 01:17:24.088
He's got a child for Christ's sakes.

01:17:24.088 --> 01:17:25.921
Anyways, I was outside,

01:17:26.421 --> 01:17:27.755
trying to get in with them.

01:17:28.671 --> 01:17:29.880
It's true.

01:17:29.880 --> 01:17:31.713
The doctor was alone in here.

01:17:32.213 --> 01:17:33.255
Not alone.

01:17:34.046 --> 01:17:35.213
Not in this house.

01:17:36.046 --> 01:17:37.130
A doctor.

01:17:38.546 --> 01:17:41.421
A nurse and a doctor,
the Children's Vendetta.

01:17:42.380 --> 01:17:43.880
There is no other way in.

01:17:43.880 --> 01:17:45.505
I can't understand.

01:17:45.505 --> 01:17:48.963
If this room wasn't safe, nowhere is safe.

01:17:49.463 --> 01:17:50.838
None of us are safe.

01:17:52.255 --> 01:17:55.255
Nothing human could have done this.

01:17:55.255 --> 01:17:58.255
"It is only for us to prove
that these apparent 'impossibilities'

01:17:58.255 --> 01:18:00.255
"are, in reality, not such."

01:18:00.255 --> 01:18:01.713
Come on, leave him.

01:18:01.713 --> 01:18:04.213
Let the detective detect.
He already knows.

01:18:04.213 --> 01:18:06.130
He's gonna come to it soon enough.

01:18:06.130 --> 01:18:08.005
Go on.

01:18:08.005 --> 01:18:09.088
For once in your life,

01:18:09.088 --> 01:18:11.421
admit that you are up against
something bigger than you.

01:18:13.380 --> 01:18:14.463
You asked.

01:18:17.338 --> 01:18:20.755
You asked why I stayed
while they summoned spirits.

01:18:21.588 --> 01:18:24.421
Alicia was wasting away as she went mad.

01:18:26.671 --> 01:18:28.630
Ms. Rowena stayed at her side

01:18:29.088 --> 01:18:30.296
<i>day and night.</i>

01:18:30.296 --> 01:18:33.005
<i>One day, I pleaded with her
to take some rest.</i>

01:18:35.130 --> 01:18:37.046
<i>I promised to keep watch.</i>

01:18:38.130 --> 01:18:39.380
<i>She slept past nightfall.</i>

01:18:40.255 --> 01:18:41.880
<i>It got to midnight.</i>

01:18:41.880 --> 01:18:43.588
<i>I heard voices.</i>

01:18:44.838 --> 01:18:47.255
<i>- And footsteps.</i>

01:18:47.796 --> 01:18:50.505
<i>Alicia was sleeping so soundly.</i>

01:18:50.505 --> 01:18:52.921
She must have woken after I left.

01:18:55.088 --> 01:18:56.588
Gone to the balcony.

01:18:56.588 --> 01:18:59.463
And you would beg her ghost's forgiveness.

01:19:01.130 --> 01:19:02.546
I loved that girl.

01:19:05.088 --> 01:19:06.380
She died

01:19:07.838 --> 01:19:10.130
because I was stupid and I was scared.

01:19:51.213 --> 01:19:54.755
<i>Why don't you have the answer?</i>

01:19:54.755 --> 01:19:57.296
You always have the answer.

01:20:28.213 --> 01:20:30.130
<i>I never should have come.</i>
<i>Wait.</i>

01:20:30.130 --> 01:20:32.880
You should all leave this place
and never look back.

01:20:37.296 --> 01:20:39.671
I will not wait to be next.

01:20:43.130 --> 01:20:44.255
Tonight,

01:20:46.505 --> 01:20:47.796
we are all afraid.

01:20:48.880 --> 01:20:52.171
There have been two impossible murders.

01:20:52.546 --> 01:20:56.755
Each murder appears
committable only by phantom,

01:20:56.755 --> 01:20:59.838
as if the living have been
killed by the dead.

01:20:59.838 --> 01:21:02.005
"Appears"? You know something.

01:21:02.005 --> 01:21:03.546
You know who killed my father?

01:21:03.546 --> 01:21:06.380
I must consider Ms. Reynolds' assistants.

01:21:06.838 --> 01:21:09.213
Survivors, desperate and threatened.

01:21:09.213 --> 01:21:12.005
The ex-police-<i>commissario</i>
who has been in this house before,

01:21:12.005 --> 01:21:13.921
each time death occurs.

01:21:13.921 --> 01:21:17.838
The authoress, determined,
capable, murderously clever.

01:21:17.838 --> 01:21:21.171
Our avenging angel, Olga Seminoff,

01:21:21.171 --> 01:21:23.880
so keen on justice as she prescribes it.

01:21:23.880 --> 01:21:26.963
The former love full of rage
for the doctor

01:21:26.963 --> 01:21:30.338
and only the fragment of a photograph

01:21:31.171 --> 01:21:35.421
to remember such happiness.

01:21:38.338 --> 01:21:39.588
But...

01:21:40.546 --> 01:21:45.005
There has been a third death,
which explains the other two.

01:21:45.005 --> 01:21:47.963
The murder of Alicia Drake

01:21:48.671 --> 01:21:50.421
committed by...

01:21:54.796 --> 01:21:56.046
...her mother.

01:21:57.421 --> 01:21:58.963
Her murderer.

01:22:00.838 --> 01:22:02.255
A mother who killed her own child,

01:22:02.255 --> 01:22:04.921
then killed twice more
to hide her terrible sin.

01:22:04.921 --> 01:22:06.421
How dare you!

01:22:06.421 --> 01:22:11.380
After all I have suffered,
to accuse me of harming my little girl!

01:22:11.380 --> 01:22:12.588
Your little girl had grown.

01:22:12.588 --> 01:22:15.171
You could not fathom
losing her to anyone else.

01:22:15.171 --> 01:22:18.421
In a rage, you tore up your
garden of rainbow flowers.

01:22:18.421 --> 01:22:20.005
Flowers? You're too far gone now.

01:22:20.005 --> 01:22:21.255
But you replanted your garden.

01:22:21.255 --> 01:22:23.463
<i>Not with a rainbow,
but with a single color.</i>

01:22:23.463 --> 01:22:26.755
<i>The single color that could give you back
what you would not live without.</i>

01:22:29.005 --> 01:22:30.088
All night, I am hearing,

01:22:30.088 --> 01:22:31.921
seeing things which are not there.

01:22:32.921 --> 01:22:36.005
I begin to believe
in the impossible presence of ghosts.

01:22:37.338 --> 01:22:40.713
When in fact I had been doped, drugged

01:22:42.546 --> 01:22:44.171
with an hallucinogenic poison.

01:22:44.171 --> 01:22:45.921
I thought my cupboards were bare.

01:22:45.921 --> 01:22:48.130
<i>Found your honey
in the linen closet.</i>

01:22:51.421 --> 01:22:52.505
<i>There is a poison</i>

01:22:52.505 --> 01:22:55.546
<i>in the flowering species
of</i> Rhododendron Ponticum.

01:22:55.546 --> 01:22:57.713
<i>Its highest concentration in the nectar</i>

01:22:57.713 --> 01:23:02.630
<i>that concentrates further
when processed by bees into honey.</i>

01:23:02.630 --> 01:23:05.630
All this effort for a teaspoon
of wildflower honey

01:23:05.630 --> 01:23:07.463
that we could buy for six lira.

01:23:07.463 --> 01:23:09.130
That's not wildflower.

01:23:11.005 --> 01:23:12.046
I can't place it.

01:23:12.046 --> 01:23:15.463
They call it "Deli bal" in Türkiye,
where it grows wild.

01:23:15.463 --> 01:23:17.671
Where Rowena Drake traveled alone, angry.

01:23:18.755 --> 01:23:21.088
"Mad honey."
A mere teaspoon of this poison

01:23:21.088 --> 01:23:22.755
<i>induces weakness,</i>

01:23:22.755 --> 01:23:24.921
<i>- fever, hallucination.</i>

01:23:24.921 --> 01:23:28.005
<i>You replanted it
with that same toxic flower</i>

01:23:28.005 --> 01:23:30.213
<i>- that would produce poison honey.</i>

01:23:30.213 --> 01:23:32.880
I couldn't do that. I wouldn't.

01:23:34.213 --> 01:23:36.046
Your daughter was not possessed.

01:23:37.296 --> 01:23:38.380
She was poisoned

01:23:38.380 --> 01:23:40.671
<i>by a mother who could not let her go.</i>

01:23:41.713 --> 01:23:45.296
<i>Who lovingly spoon-fed controlled doses</i>

01:23:45.296 --> 01:23:48.171
<i>of poison honey in her tea.</i>

01:23:48.171 --> 01:23:49.796
<i>Keeping her just sick enough</i>

01:23:49.796 --> 01:23:52.880
<i>to prevent a reunion
with her repentant love.</i>

01:23:53.380 --> 01:23:56.796
<i>Weak, helpless like a child again.</i>

01:23:57.838 --> 01:23:58.880
Yours again.

01:23:59.421 --> 01:24:01.338
Until a mistake.

01:24:01.713 --> 01:24:05.255
<i>Mrs. Seminoff watched Alicia
while you slept at last.</i>

01:24:05.255 --> 01:24:07.463
<i>Night fell and Olga grew frightened</i>

01:24:07.463 --> 01:24:09.963
<i>- when, inevitably, Alicia woke...</i>

01:24:09.963 --> 01:24:12.963
<i>...I am sure, disturbed again.</i>

01:24:12.963 --> 01:24:14.838
<i>But what to do?</i>

01:24:15.338 --> 01:24:18.463
<i>And not knowing the real truth,</i>

01:24:18.463 --> 01:24:23.296
<i>Olga Seminoff did what she believed
that you would do,</i>

01:24:23.296 --> 01:24:28.130
<i>and served Alicia Drake calming tea
sweetened with honey.</i>

01:24:29.755 --> 01:24:31.130
<i>Too sweet.</i>

01:24:31.880 --> 01:24:33.338
I didn't know.

01:24:34.255 --> 01:24:35.880
I didn't know.

01:24:36.838 --> 01:24:40.588
Alicia Drake did not run
to her balcony to commit suicide.

01:24:42.171 --> 01:24:44.296
She had overdosed on your poison.

01:24:45.255 --> 01:24:47.671
And her heart had stopped in her sleep.

01:24:48.588 --> 01:24:51.296
<i>You returned from your rest</i>

01:24:51.296 --> 01:24:54.546
<i>- to find her dead.</i>

01:24:55.380 --> 01:24:58.171
<i>- And then...</i>

01:24:58.171 --> 01:25:00.046
<i>- ...you made your monstrous choice.</i>

01:25:00.046 --> 01:25:01.130
<i>You made the mark</i>

01:25:01.130 --> 01:25:03.588
<i>- of the Children's Vendetta.</i>

01:25:03.588 --> 01:25:06.171
<i>You cut her, you threw her into the canal,</i>

01:25:06.171 --> 01:25:08.005
<i>you made her a suicide.</i>

01:25:09.588 --> 01:25:12.880
<i>A victim of legend. Of ghosts.</i>

01:25:13.380 --> 01:25:16.505
Your love-blind and incapable doctor

01:25:16.505 --> 01:25:19.171
<i>found nothing to arouse
suspicion at the inquest.</i>

01:25:19.171 --> 01:25:23.005
<i>The police, predisposed to superstition,
easily satisfied.</i>

01:25:23.005 --> 01:25:25.005
The poisoned jar left
in the linen cupboard

01:25:25.005 --> 01:25:26.463
by the careless housekeeper.

01:25:26.463 --> 01:25:29.546
You had got away
with killing your own child,

01:25:29.546 --> 01:25:33.505
until Ms. Oliver drew my attention
to something.

01:25:33.505 --> 01:25:35.255
Where did all the money go?

01:25:37.088 --> 01:25:38.255
I can't afford to fix it.

01:25:38.255 --> 01:25:40.796
<i>There is usually only one answer.</i>

01:25:41.296 --> 01:25:42.588
<i>- Blackmail.</i>

01:25:42.755 --> 01:25:45.421
<i>I suspect that someone
had found you out.</i>

01:25:45.421 --> 01:25:47.671
<i>And so you paid for their silence.</i>

01:25:47.671 --> 01:25:49.130
<i>Again and again, you paid.</i>

01:25:49.880 --> 01:25:53.046
But now, with your fortune gone
and this house unsalable at any price,

01:25:53.046 --> 01:25:55.838
you were desperate to get out
from under the blackmailer's thumb.

01:25:55.838 --> 01:25:57.046
But who could it be?

01:25:58.088 --> 01:26:00.046
<i>Your obvious suspect was Doctor Ferrier.</i>

01:26:00.046 --> 01:26:02.171
<i>Perhaps he was not so naive a witness.</i>

01:26:02.171 --> 01:26:06.213
<i>Perhaps finally,
he recognized the poison symptoms.</i>

01:26:06.213 --> 01:26:09.505
<i>And then you received your letter
from the unholy Ms. Reynolds,</i>

01:26:09.505 --> 01:26:11.963
<i>claiming messages from your lost daughter.</i>

01:26:11.963 --> 01:26:14.171
<i>Too many intimate details known,</i>

01:26:14.171 --> 01:26:18.421
<i>teasing knowledge of your crime,
her services offered at a heavy price.</i>

01:26:18.421 --> 01:26:20.630
<i>Surely this was your blackmailer.</i>

01:26:20.630 --> 01:26:22.338
<i>She had to be stopped to be safe.</i>

01:26:22.338 --> 01:26:25.796
<i>Both Ms. Reynolds and Doctor Ferrier
had to be stopped. But how?</i>

01:26:25.796 --> 01:26:29.880
The séance in a haunted house
on Halloween.

01:26:29.880 --> 01:26:32.255
The perfect opportunity to conceal

01:26:32.255 --> 01:26:35.213
the murder of those
you suspected of blackmail.

01:26:35.213 --> 01:26:37.546
Hiding behind superstition, legend, fear.

01:26:38.088 --> 01:26:39.588
<i>- The clock struck.</i>

01:26:41.921 --> 01:26:43.005
<i>And so did you.</i>

01:26:44.463 --> 01:26:46.255
<i>But in your haste, you mistake</i>

01:26:46.255 --> 01:26:48.671
<i>- the wearer of the mask.</i>

01:26:48.671 --> 01:26:51.046
<i>Disposing of me,
you find your target.</i>

01:27:00.880 --> 01:27:03.421
I was with Mrs. Seminoff at midnight.

01:27:03.421 --> 01:27:04.505
She was.

01:27:05.213 --> 01:27:06.838
We were together, I saw the time.

01:27:06.838 --> 01:27:10.255
<i>You saw the time on the clock
in the music room,</i>

01:27:10.255 --> 01:27:12.255
<i>where she had asked you to wait.</i>

01:27:12.255 --> 01:27:14.755
<i>A room, which is practically soundproof.</i>

01:27:14.755 --> 01:27:16.380
<i>Which she herself had sealed.</i>

01:27:16.380 --> 01:27:19.963
<i>And in which she had previously
changed the time</i>

01:27:19.963 --> 01:27:24.171
<i>where you could not even hear
the true midnight bell.</i>

01:27:24.171 --> 01:27:26.213
It read midnight when it was really...

01:27:26.213 --> 01:27:28.463
After Joyce Reynolds' death.

01:27:30.005 --> 01:27:33.671
The damning evidence discarded
with a magician's touch.

01:27:33.671 --> 01:27:34.963
What about Ferrier?

01:27:35.380 --> 01:27:36.880
She wasn't anywhere near him.

01:27:36.880 --> 01:27:38.880
<i>Indeed, she made
a show of the locked door,</i>

01:27:38.880 --> 01:27:40.546
<i>giving me the sole key.</i>

01:27:40.546 --> 01:27:42.546
But you would not kill
Doctor Ferrier with a knife.

01:27:42.546 --> 01:27:45.671
Your murder weapon would be a telephone.

01:27:45.671 --> 01:27:47.588
The phone line from outside
was dead, of course,

01:27:47.588 --> 01:27:48.713
because of the storm,

01:27:48.713 --> 01:27:52.005
but the internal line remained clear.

01:27:52.338 --> 01:27:55.296
No telephone call would come
from outside the house.

01:27:56.838 --> 01:27:58.338
Only from inside.

01:27:58.588 --> 01:28:00.380
She, in the dining room.

01:28:00.796 --> 01:28:02.963
<i>He, sealed in the music room.</i>

01:28:02.963 --> 01:28:05.088
<i>I know you've
been blackmailing me.</i>

01:28:05.088 --> 01:28:08.671
<i>You confessed to him everything.
To being the murderer of Joyce Reynolds.</i>

01:28:09.046 --> 01:28:11.505
<i>Of staging your own daughter's suicide.</i>

01:28:11.505 --> 01:28:12.671
It's not possible.

01:28:12.671 --> 01:28:14.296
<i>And then you made your threat.</i>

01:28:14.630 --> 01:28:16.171
Do exactly as I tell you.

01:28:16.171 --> 01:28:18.463
<i>You threatened to kill his son...</i>

01:28:18.463 --> 01:28:21.380
No! No, let him go. Leave him.

01:28:22.088 --> 01:28:24.213
<i>...his only reason to live,</i>

01:28:25.296 --> 01:28:27.588
<i>if he did not do what you told him.</i>

01:28:28.546 --> 01:28:30.463
<i>And what you told him to do</i>

01:28:31.963 --> 01:28:33.630
<i>was to take the knife.</i>

01:28:38.671 --> 01:28:41.588
- She...

01:28:41.588 --> 01:28:42.921
She killed my dad?

01:28:43.505 --> 01:28:44.671
And Ms. Reynolds.

01:28:45.046 --> 01:28:46.671
- And Alicia.
No.

01:28:47.838 --> 01:28:49.630
I would never hurt her.

01:28:50.380 --> 01:28:51.880
It was an accident.

01:28:52.588 --> 01:28:54.088
She was my whole life.

01:28:54.588 --> 01:28:56.796
- You poisoned her.
- To protect her.

01:28:56.796 --> 01:28:59.546
- To control her!
- To keep her safe from you.

01:29:20.713 --> 01:29:21.963
I couldn't let her go.

01:29:24.421 --> 01:29:25.588
She was mine.

01:30:31.088 --> 01:30:32.796
She was the best thing about me.

01:30:34.588 --> 01:30:38.338
And if there is a soul,
you gave hers peace.

01:31:04.463 --> 01:31:05.463
<i>Merci.</i>

01:31:05.463 --> 01:31:06.546
<i>Dottore.</i>

01:31:08.921 --> 01:31:12.088
They will rule
Ms. Drake a suicide.

01:31:12.088 --> 01:31:14.838
Unless you would like
to make a statement otherwise.

01:31:16.671 --> 01:31:19.421
Can I at least see you safe home,

01:31:19.421 --> 01:31:21.421
before you turn me in for fraud?

01:31:24.171 --> 01:31:25.505
In the daylight,

01:31:26.380 --> 01:31:28.380
neither appears necessary.

01:31:29.005 --> 01:31:31.338
In the end, it is you
protecting me, <i>Dottore.</i>

01:31:39.713 --> 01:31:40.838
Come on then, Leopold.

01:31:41.088 --> 01:31:42.546
Let me do the top button up.

01:31:42.546 --> 01:31:43.880
It's fine, Miss Olga.

01:31:43.880 --> 01:31:45.046
Very smart.

01:31:45.505 --> 01:31:47.338
I don't need a coat.
You'll be cold.

01:31:47.338 --> 01:31:48.421
I'm fine.

01:31:48.421 --> 01:31:50.380
I know it's sunny,
but it's still cold.

01:31:50.380 --> 01:31:52.213
- That's much better.
Miss Olga, I'm fine.

01:31:52.213 --> 01:31:53.630
Very handsome.
Thanks.

01:31:55.630 --> 01:31:56.796
<i>Madame.</i>

01:31:57.380 --> 01:32:01.005
He'll live with me
and Mr. Seminoff. And Harry.

01:32:03.255 --> 01:32:04.921
We'll mind him as our own.

01:32:05.713 --> 01:32:07.713
Might insist on a bit more sunshine.

01:32:07.713 --> 01:32:08.796
Mmm-hmm.

01:32:09.505 --> 01:32:11.546
You are a precocious boy

01:32:12.088 --> 01:32:15.255
who is perhaps ashamed
at how much he likes attention.

01:32:16.171 --> 01:32:18.005
I know something of this.

01:32:20.088 --> 01:32:23.171
You must not blame yourself
for anything that happened in this house.

01:32:23.171 --> 01:32:25.255
- Why would he do that?

01:32:26.130 --> 01:32:27.921
But it's all my fault.

01:32:28.921 --> 01:32:31.755
You did not care
for the money for yourself.

01:32:32.296 --> 01:32:34.296
You wanted to help your father.

01:32:35.796 --> 01:32:37.088
Dad couldn't work.

01:32:38.171 --> 01:32:40.421
I only used the money
to pay for our bills.

01:32:41.880 --> 01:32:44.088
I didn't even know
what to do with the rest.

01:32:44.088 --> 01:32:49.213
Rowena Drake presumed the blackmailer
was the fake medium or the family doctor,

01:32:49.713 --> 01:32:51.088
when it was neither.

01:32:51.463 --> 01:32:53.963
Only the doctor's son saw the truth.

01:32:53.963 --> 01:32:56.255
It was obvious from Dad's notes.

01:32:57.463 --> 01:32:58.671
Mad honey poisoning,

01:32:58.671 --> 01:33:01.421
just like Mitridate from her opera.

01:33:01.421 --> 01:33:02.921
The Poison King.

01:33:04.421 --> 01:33:07.088
I read all about it in one of her books
in the library.

01:33:08.296 --> 01:33:11.838
And so, I tested the theory.

01:33:12.213 --> 01:33:14.005
You sent a blackmail letter.

01:33:17.588 --> 01:33:18.796
And another.

01:33:25.546 --> 01:33:28.671
Perhaps there is a use for this money
in your mattress.

01:33:30.755 --> 01:33:32.546
To make good of regret.

01:33:35.463 --> 01:33:37.505
We survived before Ms. Reynolds.

01:33:37.505 --> 01:33:39.671
- We'll do better than survive.

01:33:39.671 --> 01:33:41.671
I promise we'll get to America. We will.

01:33:41.671 --> 01:33:43.213
Come with us, you two.

01:33:45.671 --> 01:33:47.046
To the police station?

01:33:47.880 --> 01:33:51.463
Us, to home. You, to America.
Missouri, I understand.

01:33:51.630 --> 01:33:55.213
Passage for two.
We can help with that. I think.

01:34:08.046 --> 01:34:10.338
Thank you.

01:34:12.963 --> 01:34:14.296
Thank you, thank you so much.

01:34:14.296 --> 01:34:16.421
Leave some space
for Leopold, please.

01:34:21.713 --> 01:34:22.880
You solved the case.

01:34:23.921 --> 01:34:25.046
But you had help,

01:34:25.755 --> 01:34:26.755
didn't you?

01:34:28.213 --> 01:34:29.338
You heard her.

01:34:30.880 --> 01:34:32.255
<i>Bonne chance,</i> my friend.

01:34:32.921 --> 01:34:33.921
Don't worry,

01:34:34.796 --> 01:34:37.255
people who die in this house
always come back.

01:34:38.588 --> 01:34:39.755
I'll see them again.

01:34:48.963 --> 01:34:50.421
See you soon, Dad.

01:35:17.713 --> 01:35:19.921
I won't apologize. You've ruined my book.

01:35:19.921 --> 01:35:22.171
Neither living nor proof.
I have to rewrite the whole thing.

01:35:22.171 --> 01:35:23.880
So long as it does not include my name.

01:35:23.880 --> 01:35:25.671
I never want to hear your name again.

01:35:27.588 --> 01:35:29.880
Just a house now. All debunked.

01:35:33.088 --> 01:35:34.838
But you've got the look of a believer.

01:35:35.588 --> 01:35:36.838
You did. You saw something.

01:35:36.838 --> 01:35:38.755
I was under the influence.

01:35:38.755 --> 01:35:43.921
My subconscious mind assembled facts
ahead of the rational.

01:35:45.588 --> 01:35:46.588
You saw.

01:35:48.171 --> 01:35:49.296
You know.

01:35:53.421 --> 01:35:57.588
I know only that we cannot hide
from our ghosts.

01:35:58.630 --> 01:36:00.963
Whether they are real or not,

01:36:01.546 --> 01:36:05.838
we must make our peace with them.

01:36:07.588 --> 01:36:09.713
And live life.

01:36:09.713 --> 01:36:10.796
Somehow.

01:36:12.505 --> 01:36:14.213
And how will you live your life?

01:36:58.088 --> 01:36:59.088
<i>Monsieur</i> Poirot?

01:37:01.088 --> 01:37:02.088
<i>Monsieur</i> Poirot?

01:37:03.755 --> 01:37:07.505
Your parents died
one soon after the other.

01:37:07.505 --> 01:37:08.755
Then, your brother.

01:37:09.255 --> 01:37:12.671
Your trusted doctor
is a beloved friend to the family.

01:37:12.671 --> 01:37:16.921
Your brother was unmarried,
as are you. No other relations.

01:37:17.338 --> 01:37:19.421
Your family is not cursed.

01:37:19.421 --> 01:37:23.005
I strongly suspect your brother
added a codicil to his will

01:37:23.005 --> 01:37:25.171
naming your doctor as beneficiary

01:37:25.171 --> 01:37:27.046
should all members
of your small family perish.

01:37:27.046 --> 01:37:30.046
After which I strongly suspect
he also murdered them,

01:37:30.046 --> 01:37:32.255
claiming natural causes
at their deathbeds.

01:37:32.255 --> 01:37:35.213
And your life is next in danger.
You may wish to sit.

01:37:47.380 --> 01:37:48.380
Please.

01:37:50.546 --> 01:37:55.046
So, correct me if I am wrong, <i>monsieur,</i>
your doctor was a family friend?

01:37:55.046 --> 01:37:58.505
You would play together as children.
This much is clear.

01:37:58.505 --> 01:38:01.171
However, your mother was
closer to you, right?

01:38:01.171 --> 01:38:02.296
Yes.
