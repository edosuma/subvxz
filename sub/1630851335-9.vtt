WEBVTT

00:05.548 --> 00:09.093
"The area of the brain affected
when we have sex

00:09.176 --> 00:12.179
is the same as that affected
when we fall in love.

00:12.263 --> 00:15.015
That is why it is so easy
to mistake sex for love."

00:47.757 --> 00:50.676
Sit down now!
Or you'll be in trouble.

00:50.760 --> 00:53.929
- I kill you with my laser sword.
- You're lying.

00:56.307 --> 00:57.266
Cheers.

00:57.349 --> 00:58.893
Excuse me, Carmen.

00:59.810 --> 01:01.771
Come on, sit down. I don’t bite.

01:07.276 --> 01:09.779
- Would you like some coffee?
- A little, please.

01:23.042 --> 01:25.169
LADY VILLALOBOS
IS GETTING MARRIED

01:25.211 --> 01:26.837
He's spitting seeds at me!

01:27.254 --> 01:29.548
Stop messing with me.
I'm your big brother.

01:30.090 --> 01:31.383
Good morning!

01:31.759 --> 01:33.010
Good morning, Mom.

01:33.219 --> 01:35.012
Are you teasing each other so early?

01:35.471 --> 01:37.515
- Are you leaving?
- Yes.

01:37.598 --> 01:38.808
Aren't you having breakfast?

01:38.891 --> 01:41.101
No. Good morning, Carmen.
Can I have a tea, please?

01:41.644 --> 01:43.687
- Thanks.
- Good morning.

01:44.355 --> 01:45.648
Do you need the paper?

01:46.106 --> 01:49.276
Fidel, can you tell your dad
I'm driving to the office?

01:49.360 --> 01:52.446
I have a wedding to plan,
and I'm in a hurry.

01:52.571 --> 01:54.448
She's in a hurry,
needs to plan a wedding

01:54.532 --> 01:56.283
and is driving to the office.

01:56.367 --> 01:57.910
I heard her, honey.

01:57.993 --> 02:01.413
Tell your mom it was my turn
to drive, but it's okay.

02:01.497 --> 02:03.499
As long as she can leave
her honor at home.

02:03.582 --> 02:05.793
You can take the car, just leave
your honor at home.

02:05.876 --> 02:07.211
I heard him, honey.

02:07.920 --> 02:10.005
Carmen, you're in charge
of this kids.

02:10.381 --> 02:12.424
Call me if they misbehave.

02:12.633 --> 02:15.344
And you know what to do
in case Leo misbehaves.

02:15.386 --> 02:16.804
I know, madam.

02:18.097 --> 02:19.348
Bye, Mom!

02:25.354 --> 02:27.565
I CAN'T STOP THINKING ABOUT YOU.

02:27.648 --> 02:31.026
I'M GOING TO GO CRAZY
IF YOU DON'T TALK TO ME...

02:32.319 --> 02:33.320
Hey, Mom?

02:35.406 --> 02:37.825
Can Claudio come over
to play video games today?

02:38.450 --> 02:40.536
Claudio? Your crush?

02:41.704 --> 02:43.497
Sure! That's cool!

02:43.581 --> 02:46.250
Tell me. Did you invite him over?

02:46.834 --> 02:49.712
Mom, promise
you won't embarrass me.

02:49.962 --> 02:53.215
Me? I won't, honey!
Why are you saying that?

02:53.299 --> 02:54.758
I know you, Mom.

02:56.385 --> 02:57.928
- Good morning.
- Hi, Dad.

02:58.137 --> 02:59.305
Hello, babe.

03:01.932 --> 03:05.686
Did you know that today
Mica is going to have a date...

03:06.770 --> 03:08.731
with her friend Claudio?

03:09.815 --> 03:13.527
I'm glad, honey.
But I'm quite jealous.

03:14.528 --> 03:15.613
God, Dad.

03:16.530 --> 03:18.490
Honey, why don't we pick up Mica

03:18.532 --> 03:20.701
from school and have lunch together?

03:24.204 --> 03:25.456
I'm busy today.

03:35.925 --> 03:38.385
THE GAME OF KEYS

03:39.720 --> 03:42.389
It's expensive.
But he sings just like Elvis.

03:42.765 --> 03:46.226
Expensive? Nothing is expensive
to the Ortiz-Villalobos!

03:46.644 --> 03:49.939
And neither to us.
After this wedding we will be rich.

03:50.022 --> 03:53.025
- We're going to Vegas!
- I love your idea...

03:53.150 --> 03:56.904
You are treacherous and ungrateful.
How could you?

03:57.863 --> 04:00.699
- What are you talking about?
- What do you mean?

04:00.991 --> 04:04.328
We're working on a slideshow for you.
It's almost ready.

04:04.620 --> 04:07.581
Oh, come on!
Do you really think I'm hiring you?

04:07.915 --> 04:10.626
Of course not! And that's not all.

04:10.751 --> 04:14.630
I'll sue you and I'm going
to take out every penny from you.

04:14.755 --> 04:18.425
I'm sorry. I don't follow you.
Don't talk to us in that tone.

04:18.550 --> 04:22.596
- Let's relax, please.
- I can't! Look at this!

04:22.680 --> 04:24.181
I'm trending topic now.

04:24.848 --> 04:28.102
Who's L. Cuevas and why does he have
all the details on my wedding?

04:28.310 --> 04:31.271
She doesn't even look like me. My...

04:32.106 --> 04:35.317
- My teeth aren't that big.
- Sure they aren't.

04:36.068 --> 04:38.612
You have perfect teeth.

04:39.530 --> 04:41.365
You were the only ones
who actually knew.

04:44.618 --> 04:46.036
You know the guy!

04:46.537 --> 04:48.664
- Who is he?
- He's my spouse.

04:49.081 --> 04:51.291
I never thought he'd dare to do
something like that.

04:51.375 --> 04:54.545
I don't care if you thought
he'd dare or not.

04:55.212 --> 04:57.548
If I were you, I'd start kissing
my business goodbye.

04:58.132 --> 04:59.717
My money, and my life.

05:00.009 --> 05:01.927
I won't stop
until you lose everything.

05:03.679 --> 05:05.848
No one messes with me.

05:06.432 --> 05:09.476
Aurelia, I'm sure
we can sort this out.

05:10.060 --> 05:13.147
I suggest you find a good lawyer.

05:23.907 --> 05:27.411
Do you remember the jacket
Ryan wears on "Drive"? The scorpion?

05:27.828 --> 05:31.373
It was mine, he borrowed it from me.

05:31.707 --> 05:33.625
Hi, Óscar.
Are you ready for the meeting?

05:35.252 --> 05:37.629
Pack all your stuff and get out.
Do you hear me?

05:37.713 --> 05:39.173
What are you doing, Óscar?

05:39.798 --> 05:42.259
Are you out of your mind?
What's wrong with you?

05:43.010 --> 05:46.263
You all witnessed it.
He just attacked me.

05:46.430 --> 05:49.308
- I did nothing. I'll sue you!
- You?

05:49.391 --> 05:51.602
I did some research.

05:51.852 --> 05:54.688
You've never worked for any
major company, including Apple.

05:54.772 --> 05:56.982
And he was never
Ryan Gosling's double.

05:57.524 --> 05:58.484
No...

05:59.485 --> 06:01.070
Is that true, Sergio?

06:02.279 --> 06:05.365
We all cheat on our resumes.

06:05.616 --> 06:06.867
Oh, God!

06:10.287 --> 06:11.330
Wait.

06:11.538 --> 06:13.082
Do as you must.

06:13.916 --> 06:17.044
He's cute. But I never
really liked him that much.

06:19.129 --> 06:20.380
You are fired.

06:21.215 --> 06:23.050
And don't come near
this office again,

06:23.467 --> 06:24.802
let alone my family.

06:38.774 --> 06:40.067
Are you okay?

06:41.318 --> 06:42.528
I am. I'm sorry.

06:43.987 --> 06:45.781
Go back to work, people.

06:53.914 --> 06:55.040
What can I say?

06:55.415 --> 06:56.959
Basically, you're fucked.

06:57.960 --> 07:00.129
You broke
the non-disclosure agreement.

07:00.379 --> 07:03.132
Miss Ortiz-Villalobos can sue you.

07:03.715 --> 07:05.050
What can we do about it?

07:06.468 --> 07:08.804
Being one of the most powerful
families in Mexico,

07:08.887 --> 07:10.264
and she is also entitled.

07:10.597 --> 07:11.807
It's complicated.

07:12.850 --> 07:14.935
A bit of friendly advice.

07:15.644 --> 07:18.897
Transfer all your assets.
They could be seized.

07:20.941 --> 07:23.402
- And our business?
- That should be first.

07:26.822 --> 07:29.908
Try to talk Villalobos out
of the lawsuit.

07:29.992 --> 07:31.326
It's your only chance.

07:31.493 --> 07:32.536
That's it.

07:35.539 --> 07:36.957
Thanks, Roberto.

07:38.292 --> 07:40.502
Everything will be fine.
Keep me posted.

07:40.586 --> 07:42.963
- Thanks.
- See you.

07:48.468 --> 07:50.387
I just need to practice.

07:50.470 --> 07:52.681
But you don't even know
how to hold the golf club.

07:53.307 --> 07:54.850
Hi, there!

07:55.726 --> 07:57.561
- How did it go?
- Hello.

07:58.937 --> 08:02.816
It went fine. But it's so hard
to play golf.

08:03.066 --> 08:05.861
He really sucks.
He just needs to practice.

08:05.944 --> 08:08.864
I did't hit a single ball
and I only hurt the grass.

08:09.740 --> 08:12.784
- Two glasses of white wine, please.
- Right away, sir.

08:13.577 --> 08:16.330
Thanks for the invitation.
I've always wanted to play golf.

08:16.496 --> 08:18.999
We could sponsor you, right, honey?

08:20.209 --> 08:21.251
Honey?

08:23.170 --> 08:24.755
Yes, sure. No problem.

08:26.340 --> 08:27.424
What?

08:28.592 --> 08:30.928
Since I got pregnant,
I've been hornier than usual.

08:31.011 --> 08:32.429
It's the hormones.

08:32.596 --> 08:34.723
- We don't know them yet.
- Don't judge me.

08:35.224 --> 08:39.478
- You're being indiscreet.
- It's okay, don't worry.

08:39.728 --> 08:42.064
We're open-minded.

08:42.272 --> 08:46.652
Right now, our relationship
is going through...

08:47.402 --> 08:50.530
a period of discovery?

08:51.615 --> 08:55.160
- How's that? Tell us more.
- We want to know.

08:56.245 --> 08:58.038
- Yeah?
- Gaby...

08:58.330 --> 09:01.375
Well, a friend of ours...

09:02.209 --> 09:04.086
throws...

09:05.170 --> 09:08.215
these ordinary parties...

09:08.632 --> 09:11.969
with ordinary people.
But at the end of the night...

09:13.095 --> 09:14.012
Are you okay?

09:14.471 --> 09:15.472
I am. Sorry.

09:18.600 --> 09:19.935
Let me help you.

09:21.687 --> 09:23.939
- At the end of the night what?
- What?

09:24.856 --> 09:26.733
Here, please.

09:27.192 --> 09:28.986
- Let's have a toast.
- Right.

09:29.528 --> 09:30.654
Whatever.

09:33.824 --> 09:36.660
- With your left hand.
- I didn't know that.

09:40.706 --> 09:43.917
"Lady Villalobos" is trending topic.

09:44.459 --> 09:48.005
And our newspaper is too.
Good job, Leo.

09:48.672 --> 09:51.091
This just proves the power

09:51.133 --> 09:54.886
of responsible media, like us,

09:55.387 --> 10:00.684
against this rotten system
that governs us!

10:01.310 --> 10:02.269
You know what?

10:02.811 --> 10:04.187
People are tired.

10:04.479 --> 10:06.273
Leonardo Cuevas? Where is he?

10:07.274 --> 10:08.483
Leonardo Cuevas?

10:08.692 --> 10:09.818
Thanks.

10:11.153 --> 10:12.154
Leonardo...

10:12.279 --> 10:13.613
Here you are.

10:15.073 --> 10:16.742
I can see you're on it.

10:20.120 --> 10:21.830
How could you do this to me?

10:22.372 --> 10:24.374
You didn't like my cartoon?

10:25.751 --> 10:27.044
You've screwed us.

10:28.712 --> 10:30.422
Please, stay.

10:30.547 --> 10:34.134
You need to know that this beast
isn't even my husband.

10:34.217 --> 10:37.262
Because he doesn't believe
in marriage, right?

10:37.763 --> 10:40.807
After 10 years together
and two children.

10:41.433 --> 10:44.227
He sets his beliefs before us.

10:45.645 --> 10:47.022
This time...

10:47.981 --> 10:53.111
you broke a non-disclosure agreement
from one of my clients.

10:54.696 --> 10:56.740
And now, she's suing me.

10:57.324 --> 10:59.159
We're about to lose everything.

11:00.035 --> 11:03.914
We're going to fight back!
Free speech is our right!

11:04.206 --> 11:05.916
- Right?
- That's right.

11:06.792 --> 11:09.002
We have no rights!

11:09.419 --> 11:12.089
I signed a NDA!

11:14.257 --> 11:16.385
Anyway, you've never backed me.

11:17.219 --> 11:19.721
And you were right.

11:22.349 --> 11:25.310
Marriage isn't meant for us.

11:25.727 --> 11:28.105
Barbie, it was working.

11:28.688 --> 11:30.190
You and I...

11:31.108 --> 11:32.526
weren't working.

11:32.943 --> 11:35.404
We had great sex. That's different.

11:36.571 --> 11:39.074
But now I see that role-playing

11:39.741 --> 11:43.662
or S&M, or swingers parties...

11:44.079 --> 11:47.791
can't solve our issues.
We are over, Leo.

11:49.960 --> 11:51.753
I want you out of the house today.

11:53.463 --> 11:56.591
- It's my house too.
- It's not, baby.

11:57.968 --> 12:00.720
Thanks to you it's now owned
by the Ortiz-Villalobos.

12:06.893 --> 12:07.936
Hi, babe.

12:08.603 --> 12:09.604
Hey.

12:09.729 --> 12:13.191
Why were you upset
when I mentioned the Game of Keys?

12:14.067 --> 12:17.946
- Were you embarrassed?
- I thought you were indiscreet.

12:19.322 --> 12:20.782
We've just met them.

12:23.618 --> 12:24.995
It didn't look that way.

12:26.455 --> 12:29.791
- What do you mean?
- It's like you already knew them.

12:30.417 --> 12:34.087
I thought you'd known them
for a long time.

12:34.129 --> 12:36.965
- That's why I brought it up.
- You're wrong, babe.

12:38.300 --> 12:39.593
I've just met them.

12:41.803 --> 12:43.096
I don't believe you.

12:47.267 --> 12:48.518
I'll take a shower.

12:56.026 --> 12:57.444
How are you, madam?

12:58.361 --> 13:01.573
Don't call me madam.
Please, call me Adriana.

13:02.199 --> 13:04.743
I'm not the typical mom.

13:06.745 --> 13:09.706
Mica is on her way.
Traffic's heavy.

13:10.165 --> 13:14.753
While we wait,
do you want a whisky or tequila?

13:16.838 --> 13:18.507
No. Thank you.

13:18.882 --> 13:20.091
I was joking.

13:21.259 --> 13:25.555
- A glass of water?
- Water is perfect, madam.

13:25.931 --> 13:27.140
Adriana.

13:42.572 --> 13:46.034
- I don't know.
- Why are you so upset?

13:46.201 --> 13:48.620
Because I'm married, honey.
That's why.

13:50.121 --> 13:52.541
I won't lie.
I'm attracted to Daniel.

13:53.375 --> 13:54.292
But I'm married.

13:54.709 --> 13:57.295
Give me his number.
I'll invite him to my party.

13:57.379 --> 13:58.296
You think?

14:00.131 --> 14:01.883
Gaby is attending the party.

14:02.509 --> 14:03.510
How would that work?

14:04.135 --> 14:06.304
Siena, please. Help me!

14:06.471 --> 14:10.308
You're not doing anything wrong.
You deserve to find out who you are.

14:10.517 --> 14:13.144
And she also deserves to know
who she's married to.

14:14.688 --> 14:16.940
Valentín, lies can only hurt.

14:19.192 --> 14:21.444
It's time everyone learns the truth.

14:23.572 --> 14:27.075
Besides, you're my sponsor.
It's practically your party.

14:27.576 --> 14:30.078
You can do as you please.

14:31.788 --> 14:32.956
I don't know.

14:34.082 --> 14:36.585
Relax.
Everything is going to be fine.

14:40.880 --> 14:43.174
Tell me, when did you start driving?

14:43.258 --> 14:44.843
- A while ago.
- Really?

14:44.926 --> 14:47.220
Yes. About...

14:48.597 --> 14:50.098
A couple of months ago.

14:50.557 --> 14:52.559
- That long?
- I know.

14:53.435 --> 14:55.395
- You'd like to see my license?
- Sure.

15:05.447 --> 15:06.615
A condom.

15:06.865 --> 15:09.492
But it isn't mine. It's my dad's.

15:10.910 --> 15:15.915
I mean, Dad gave it to me.
He insists that I need to be careful.

15:16.166 --> 15:18.793
But I'd never wear it.

15:19.044 --> 15:22.839
- What do you mean?
- I mean, I'd use it if I had to.

15:23.214 --> 15:25.467
But I'm not going to use it,
with Mica.

15:25.925 --> 15:29.262
- Never?
- I mean, only if I had to.

15:29.346 --> 15:31.306
- But I won't.
- I don't follow.

15:32.140 --> 15:34.351
I mean, I don't know. You see?

15:35.727 --> 15:39.898
It's obvious that your dad cares
and loves you very much.

15:40.607 --> 15:43.401
Maybe he isn't as cool as I am.

15:44.277 --> 15:45.320
Mom!

15:46.029 --> 15:49.282
- What are you doing?
- We're just having a conversation.

15:50.033 --> 15:51.368
I have to go.

15:52.410 --> 15:53.662
Don't go.

15:58.833 --> 16:01.419
I didn't do anything, Mica!

16:01.586 --> 16:05.256
Claudio had a condom
in his wallet and it fell out.

16:05.340 --> 16:08.843
- I was just handing back his condom.
- Mom?

16:09.302 --> 16:11.513
- Stop saying "condom."
- Why?

16:11.596 --> 16:13.181
You've ruined everything!

16:14.557 --> 16:15.934
As usual.

16:16.810 --> 16:18.019
I hate you!

16:18.103 --> 16:20.188
- What is it, Mica?
- Ask Mom.

16:21.898 --> 16:23.274
Mica, I'm talking to you.

16:24.234 --> 16:26.027
I need you to understand...

16:28.780 --> 16:29.823
What now?

16:29.906 --> 16:34.244
Not now, Óscar, please.
It's been a shitty day!

16:34.285 --> 16:37.163
Mine too! But I come home
and my daughter is upset

16:37.330 --> 16:39.791
- because you did something wrong.
- It isn't my fault.

16:39.958 --> 16:42.669
This boy had a condom
in his wallet and it fell off.

16:42.752 --> 16:47.716
I was handing back his condom
just when Mica showed up.

16:48.383 --> 16:51.261
You really gave a condom
to our daughter's date?

16:51.970 --> 16:53.304
I didn't!

16:54.013 --> 16:56.558
You didn't!
You never do anything wrong!

16:57.851 --> 16:59.144
What does that mean?

17:00.103 --> 17:01.020
Tell me.

17:01.646 --> 17:04.858
Be honest. Why did you insist
on playing the Game of Keys?

17:05.567 --> 17:06.818
What?

17:07.235 --> 17:08.319
Just...

17:17.203 --> 17:19.372
What does the Game have
to do with it?

17:19.414 --> 17:22.834
Just answer me!
Why did you insist so much?

17:23.334 --> 17:24.878
You know why.

17:25.962 --> 17:29.841
- I wanted us to experience...
- You're lying!

17:30.425 --> 17:32.260
You just wanted to fuck...

17:33.344 --> 17:36.514
Because I've never been enough,
right?

17:37.098 --> 17:39.058
The Game was your excuse!

17:39.350 --> 17:42.020
I was an idiot to trust you.

17:42.103 --> 17:45.231
Oh, yeah. Poor little thing.

17:45.690 --> 17:48.610
You fucked my best friend twice.
Not once, twice.

17:48.693 --> 17:51.154
But you were aware of that!

17:51.237 --> 17:54.866
That's right.
And that's your perfect excuse.

17:57.744 --> 17:59.204
But I didn't like her before...

18:14.052 --> 18:16.221
I NEED TO SEE YOU.

19:02.851 --> 19:05.019
- Your whisky.
- Thanks.

19:05.103 --> 19:07.355
- A snack.
- Thanks.

19:07.480 --> 19:09.607
- Can I get you anything else?
- I'm fine. Thanks.

19:09.732 --> 19:12.819
- I'm expecting someone.
- Excuse me.

19:20.118 --> 19:21.703
Why this place?

19:24.080 --> 19:27.250
I don't want to be seen.
And it's dark in here.

19:30.837 --> 19:32.255
What happened to your face?

19:32.797 --> 19:34.549
Nothing. I'm fine.

19:37.051 --> 19:38.219
I was dying to see you.

19:39.512 --> 19:41.014
I just needed...

19:41.723 --> 19:43.308
time to think.

19:44.976 --> 19:46.853
I don't know what to do, Sergio.

19:47.437 --> 19:48.938
My world is crumbling.

19:49.188 --> 19:51.190
Why? Did Óscar find out?

19:51.774 --> 19:53.776
I don't know.
But he's acting weird.

19:54.027 --> 19:55.570
And that's not the only thing.

19:56.946 --> 19:58.406
The real thing is...

19:58.615 --> 20:01.200
Óscar is right about something.

20:01.993 --> 20:02.994
What?

20:03.995 --> 20:06.873
I insisted on playing
the Game of Keys...

20:07.874 --> 20:09.709
because I wanted to have
sex with you.

20:11.586 --> 20:13.004
Me too.

20:14.088 --> 20:17.091
I almost died
when you first backed out.

20:18.760 --> 20:22.013
But then we had sex...

20:22.889 --> 20:24.557
and I can't get you out of my mind.

20:25.183 --> 20:26.768
I don't know if you're being honest.

20:30.563 --> 20:32.148
Yes, I know.

20:33.483 --> 20:37.028
An irresponsible womanizer
can't have feelings for someone.

20:39.238 --> 20:40.823
But I really like you.

20:43.576 --> 20:47.956
I know you have a family
and I would hate to hurt them.

20:49.123 --> 20:51.376
It's not easy
because I'm in love with you.

20:54.170 --> 20:55.380
I don't need a young girl.

20:56.381 --> 20:57.840
I want a woman like you.

21:02.178 --> 21:03.429
I want you by my side.

21:05.181 --> 21:06.349
If that's what you want.

21:38.548 --> 21:39.549
Who is it?

21:40.717 --> 21:41.718
It's Gaby.

21:47.098 --> 21:48.516
- Hey.
- Hi.

21:48.891 --> 21:51.269
- Is Adriana home?
- She isn't.

21:51.728 --> 21:52.729
Come in.

21:53.563 --> 21:54.605
Hey.

22:01.529 --> 22:02.989
Want something to drink?

22:04.490 --> 22:07.577
- A sip from your beer.
- Have a seat.

22:08.703 --> 22:12.290
I don't know where Adriana is.
She won't even let me know now.

22:12.999 --> 22:14.250
How have you been?

22:24.677 --> 22:27.055
Not here. We can't do it here.

22:31.350 --> 22:32.560
Also...

22:32.810 --> 22:34.187
I think I can't...

22:34.687 --> 22:39.233
I can't cheat on Adriana,
and you can't cheat on Valentín.

22:40.234 --> 22:42.779
I think I just saw Valentín
hitting on a man.

22:44.030 --> 22:45.156
What?

22:45.531 --> 22:46.866
I was there too.

22:46.908 --> 22:50.244
The other man was rubbing his foot
on Valentín's legs under the table.

22:51.829 --> 22:53.289
You think he's gay?

22:53.414 --> 22:56.209
And I'm stupid enough
not to have found out all this time?

22:57.418 --> 22:58.753
You're kidding, right?

22:58.836 --> 23:02.090
I mean, we've known Valentín
like forever.

23:02.131 --> 23:03.591
I never thought...

23:04.717 --> 23:06.052
He likes Maluma's songs.

23:09.097 --> 23:10.473
He loves musicals.

23:13.101 --> 23:15.311
- Really..
- I mean...

23:17.730 --> 23:19.315
- Hey!
- Hi.

23:20.608 --> 23:22.610
I called you.
I needed to talk to you.

23:22.693 --> 23:24.403
I came by because you didn't answer.

23:24.695 --> 23:27.406
- And...
- Right...

23:28.116 --> 23:30.785
I told her she could wait for you.

23:31.869 --> 23:35.873
I was driving around.
Maybe there was no signal.

23:38.501 --> 23:39.794
Is something wrong?

23:44.465 --> 23:46.134
I needed to tell you something.

23:46.259 --> 23:48.719
But maybe tomorrow,
while working out.

23:49.804 --> 23:52.014
I must go. Thanks for the beer.

23:54.684 --> 23:56.060
Say hi to Mica for me.

23:57.812 --> 23:58.938
Okay.

24:20.543 --> 24:21.502
Mica?

24:23.504 --> 24:24.505
Mica!

24:36.934 --> 24:39.228
I know I can be a bit much.

24:39.562 --> 24:43.149
- But I don't mean...
- What were you saying?

24:51.407 --> 24:53.326
I know I can be a bit much.

24:54.785 --> 24:57.788
But I did nothing wrong this time.

24:58.164 --> 25:00.082
I know, Mom. Claudio...

25:01.667 --> 25:04.128
Claudio texted me
explaining what happened.

25:05.630 --> 25:08.549
I think his dad
is kind of intense too.

25:11.510 --> 25:13.888
That's another thing
we have in common.

25:14.931 --> 25:16.265
Are you upset?

25:19.602 --> 25:21.520
Claudio thinks
that you're super cool.

25:21.520 --> 25:24.315
And he'd love his mom to be like you.

25:33.074 --> 25:34.575
Are you and Dad...

25:35.743 --> 25:37.495
getting a divorce?

25:38.037 --> 25:40.122
What? What are you talking about?

25:40.957 --> 25:43.834
I mean, if you want to stay married,
it's fine.

25:43.960 --> 25:47.296
But if you prefer to be separated...

25:48.214 --> 25:50.007
I'm fine with it.

26:02.103 --> 26:03.187
Don't worry.

26:21.539 --> 26:23.791
I guess I'll be staying in a hotel.

26:28.212 --> 26:29.297
Bárbara.

26:30.464 --> 26:32.675
I'm not joking. I'm leaving forever.

26:35.886 --> 26:37.638
Are you sure you want me out?

27:01.454 --> 27:03.414
Stay away from my study.

27:13.174 --> 27:16.177
ARE YOU READY FOR THE BIG PARTY?

27:20.222 --> 27:22.975
SORRY, WE CAN'T GO TO THE PARTY.

27:23.934 --> 27:25.186
Who are you texting?

27:26.645 --> 27:28.773
I'm telling Siena
we can't go to her party.

27:29.148 --> 27:32.818
Considering our current situation,
there's no point in going.

27:33.069 --> 27:35.905
- It isn't a good time.
- Do as you please.

27:55.383 --> 27:56.384
Babe?

27:57.510 --> 27:59.553
I don't want to go to Siena's party.

28:00.137 --> 28:03.182
You can't call it off.
We've agreed to go.

28:05.851 --> 28:08.354
Since when do you like Siena
that much?

28:09.188 --> 28:12.316
We've just met her.
Missing her party isn't a big deal.

28:12.566 --> 28:13.901
She wouldn't even notice.

28:17.780 --> 28:18.906
What is it?

28:19.949 --> 28:22.743
Are you hiding something from me?

28:23.452 --> 28:26.539
I'm not.
It's okay if you don't want to go.

28:27.665 --> 28:28.999
I don't care.

28:30.042 --> 28:33.170
I'll call it off, then.
I don't want to go.

28:34.922 --> 28:36.715
I'll let her know.

28:52.606 --> 28:53.899
Towels...

29:00.072 --> 29:01.866
- Fuck!
- What?

29:03.409 --> 29:05.703
Your school friends
are cancelling on me?

29:06.036 --> 29:06.996
All of them?

29:08.414 --> 29:11.041
It just sounds weird to me.
At the same time?

29:11.917 --> 29:14.378
It's okay. Don't worry.
You've invited tons of people.

29:14.462 --> 29:16.755
Yeah. But I promised
there'd be old people too.

29:18.424 --> 29:20.092
I need to persuade them.

29:20.634 --> 29:24.054
What did you want to tell me
last night?

29:29.018 --> 29:30.561
I think Valentín is bisexual.

29:31.604 --> 29:32.771
Or gay.

29:33.814 --> 29:34.940
Valentín?

29:35.608 --> 29:36.942
What do you mean?

29:37.401 --> 29:40.905
Come on. Gaby, you would've noticed
a long time ago.

29:41.071 --> 29:45.367
What if I don't really want to notice
what's going on?

29:46.494 --> 29:49.788
Gaby, you know? I think you're right.

29:51.999 --> 29:54.210
Valentín is really weird.

29:54.376 --> 29:58.297
What happened between you two?
He didn't talk about it.

29:58.464 --> 29:59.965
Nothing happened!

30:01.634 --> 30:03.719
Nothing happened, and Valentín...

30:03.928 --> 30:06.805
Why are you fucking missing
my birthday party?

30:07.473 --> 30:09.558
I don't feel like going with Leo.

30:09.683 --> 30:11.227
Same here.

30:11.644 --> 30:13.646
Gaby isn't going
because Valentín is gay.

30:13.729 --> 30:15.272
- Bárbara!
- What?

30:15.356 --> 30:16.732
There's no point in hiding it.

30:16.815 --> 30:18.526
We aren't sure if he's gay.

30:19.318 --> 30:23.322
You can't stop exploring
your sexuality over your husbands.

30:23.697 --> 30:26.367
Listen, Siena.
Thank you for helping us.

30:26.492 --> 30:28.661
But your stupid game
fucked our lives.

30:28.702 --> 30:31.330
I'm sorry. It isn't my game's fault.

30:31.705 --> 30:33.332
But what you've discovered.

30:33.707 --> 30:36.001
And you were fucked
way before starting to play.

30:36.085 --> 30:40.130
Do you really love your husbands?
Or it's just a habit?

30:45.553 --> 30:48.055
Leo and Óscar are uninvited.

30:48.389 --> 30:49.890
But you need to go.

30:50.349 --> 30:53.519
- What about Valentín?
- He needs to go.

30:53.561 --> 30:55.563
You'll find out
whether he's gay or not.

30:58.107 --> 31:01.110
- I'm in, then.
- Me too. You'll need support.

31:02.695 --> 31:05.030
Besides, I'm thirsty for revenge.

31:06.574 --> 31:09.285
- Good!
- I'm in too, obviously.

31:11.704 --> 31:14.540
- We're in, then.
- Excellent decision, girls!

31:14.623 --> 31:16.542
What do you say?

31:17.668 --> 31:19.587
- It's on the tip of my tongue.
- Go ahead, then.

31:19.962 --> 31:21.839
- I want to fuck.
- Louder.

31:22.089 --> 31:24.258
- I want to fuck!
- Again!

31:24.425 --> 31:26.302
I want to fuck!

31:28.637 --> 31:31.348
- Shall I take your order?
- A round of tequila!

31:31.432 --> 31:32.391
Fine.
