WEBVTT

00:04.212 --> 00:05.587
Hey, what's going on?

00:05.839 --> 00:08.132
I found a note on my door,
"Come to Monica's.

00:08.341 --> 00:11.427
Bring champagne
and a Three Musketeers bar"?

00:11.636 --> 00:13.178
Yeah, I'll take that.

00:13.930 --> 00:15.014
What's up?

00:15.223 --> 00:18.726
- Monica and I are engaged.
- Oh, my God.

00:23.273 --> 00:25.774
Congratulations. Where is she?

00:26.026 --> 00:28.777
I'm engaged! I'm engaged!

00:30.196 --> 00:32.906
She's been there for 20 minutes.
You didn't hear?

00:33.158 --> 00:35.951
I thought it was a kid yelling, "I'm gay!"

00:37.746 --> 00:41.081
- Can I bring her in?
- Let her stay. It's sweet.

00:41.416 --> 00:44.668
I'm getting married! I'm gonna be a bride!

00:44.919 --> 00:46.462
Shut up.

00:46.671 --> 00:50.090
No, I will not shut up, because I'm engaged!

00:51.551 --> 00:55.471
Oh, big talk! Why don't you
come here and say that to me?

00:55.680 --> 00:58.390
My fiancÃ© will kick your ass.

01:00.101 --> 01:03.020
Come on, apartment 20, apartment 20.

01:04.605 --> 01:07.900
You get her in, you bolt the door,
I'll be in the closet.

01:47.774 --> 01:50.776
Okay, wait, wait, wait. Okay, shh.

01:50.944 --> 01:52.820
Okay. Um.

01:53.029 --> 01:57.574
I just want to say that I love
you guys so, so much...

01:57.826 --> 02:00.369
...and thank you for being here
on my special night.

02:01.871 --> 02:03.372
Our special night.

02:04.040 --> 02:07.376
It just wouldn't be my night... Our night...

02:07.585 --> 02:11.463
...if you weren't here to celebrate
with me... Us. Damn it!

02:11.714 --> 02:15.092
It's okay, I want this to be your night too.

02:15.510 --> 02:17.010
To Monica.

02:17.262 --> 02:19.054
Come on, wait, stop it.

02:19.389 --> 02:22.516
- Okay, to Monica.
- To Monica.

02:23.309 --> 02:27.688
Have you decided on a band for the
wedding, because I'm kind of musical.

02:28.523 --> 02:32.151
She got engaged a few hours ago,
I doubt she's had time to think...

02:32.318 --> 02:35.571
Speaking of chiming in,
remember burning my apartment?

02:37.282 --> 02:39.283
Yeah, you're on your own.

02:39.868 --> 02:43.495
We should get dressed up
and go have champagne at the Plaza.

02:43.705 --> 02:45.289
- Oh, okay!
- Yeah.

02:45.540 --> 02:47.124
I can't stay too long.

02:47.375 --> 02:50.794
I gotta get up early for an audition.
I gotta look good.

02:51.045 --> 02:53.881
I'm supposed to be playing a 19-year-old.

02:55.842 --> 02:56.884
What?

02:57.093 --> 03:00.554
So when you said get up early,
did you mean 1986?

03:02.515 --> 03:04.308
You guys don't think I look 19?

03:07.312 --> 03:09.771
Oh, 19! We thought you said 90.

03:09.981 --> 03:11.190
Oh.

03:13.443 --> 03:15.944
- Okay, everybody, let's go.
- Okay.

03:19.282 --> 03:21.325
Is my candy bar around here?

03:21.576 --> 03:22.910
No, you ate it all.

03:23.119 --> 03:25.454
I was afraid of that.

03:33.254 --> 03:36.048
You know what shoes would look great
with this ring?

03:36.299 --> 03:37.966
Diamond shoes.

03:40.303 --> 03:42.346
You're not getting dressed.

03:47.602 --> 03:49.353
Know what I mean?

03:51.189 --> 03:53.649
Yeah, but I don't think we have time.

03:53.858 --> 03:55.525
There's gonna be a wedding.

03:55.777 --> 03:57.319
You're gonna be the bride.

03:57.528 --> 04:01.740
Two hundred people are gonna be
looking at you in a clean, white dress.

04:02.659 --> 04:04.159
Let's do it.

04:12.710 --> 04:15.587
Chandler, it happens to lots of guys.

04:17.130 --> 04:19.716
You're tired, you had a lot of champagne.

04:19.926 --> 04:22.219
Don't worry about it.

04:23.846 --> 04:27.766
I'm not worried. I'm fascinated.

04:28.101 --> 04:30.686
You know? It's like biology.

04:30.895 --> 04:34.439
Which is funny, because in high school
I failed biology...

04:34.691 --> 04:37.484
...and tonight biology failed me.

04:39.529 --> 04:43.657
Check it out. I could play this
while the guests are coming in, okay.

04:44.409 --> 04:49.538
First time I met Chandler
I thought he was gay

04:50.832 --> 04:57.254
But here I am singing
On his wedding day

04:58.089 --> 04:59.548
Phoebe, no.

05:00.008 --> 05:04.219
If you'd let me finish, it goes on
to say that he's probably not gay.

05:06.764 --> 05:11.018
You guys don't have this problem,
you're made of wood.

05:14.522 --> 05:16.273
- Hey, you look great.
- Hey.

05:16.482 --> 05:18.191
Oh, thanks.

05:18.693 --> 05:19.943
You okay over there?

05:21.404 --> 05:24.948
I don't know. You know? I feel a little...

05:27.160 --> 05:29.703
You know what? Never mind. I'll be fine.

05:29.954 --> 05:35.083
Don't worry about it. You're probably tired,
you had a lot of champagne.

05:35.752 --> 05:37.544
It happens to everybody.

05:40.965 --> 05:42.632
- Hey. Wow.
- Hi.

05:42.842 --> 05:45.886
- Happy Monica's Night.
- Well, thank you. You too.

05:46.137 --> 05:49.306
Can you believe
they are actually getting married?

05:49.515 --> 05:52.601
Well, sure, but I get married all the time.

05:55.897 --> 05:58.774
- You okay?
- Yeah, I guess.

06:00.276 --> 06:03.070
Do you think we'll ever have that?

06:04.197 --> 06:06.031
You mean "we," you and me?

06:06.240 --> 06:08.617
Oh, no, no, no.

06:08.868 --> 06:11.119
"We," you with someone, me with someone.

06:11.329 --> 06:12.996
Good, you scared me a minute.

06:13.247 --> 06:15.374
I know. Shake it off.

06:16.042 --> 06:19.544
It's just because you and I,
we were like a nightmare.

06:22.465 --> 06:27.177
- No, but there were some good times.
- Absolutely. Like there was...

06:29.013 --> 06:33.183
- Surely you can think of something.
- Just give me a minute.

06:34.519 --> 06:36.978
Oh, well, yes.

06:37.230 --> 06:41.733
- I can think of one good thing.
- What?

06:43.820 --> 06:47.406
You were always good at the...

06:49.242 --> 06:51.660
...at the, uh, the stuff.

06:53.913 --> 06:55.831
Yeah, I...

06:57.125 --> 06:58.375
I was good at the stuff?

06:58.626 --> 06:59.960
Mm-hm. Yup.

07:00.211 --> 07:02.003
I really liked your hands.

07:02.255 --> 07:03.880
- My hands?
- Yeah.

07:04.340 --> 07:06.800
- Yeah?
- Uh-huh.

07:07.176 --> 07:08.635
Way to go, guys.

07:10.930 --> 07:13.056
You were really good at the stuff too.

07:13.307 --> 07:14.724
Oh, I know.

07:17.812 --> 07:19.980
Hey, you know what we never did?

07:21.274 --> 07:22.357
Oh, no, not that.

07:23.901 --> 07:25.735
We never had bonus night.

07:25.945 --> 07:27.446
- A what?
- You know, bonus night.

07:27.655 --> 07:31.491
Two people break up,
but they get back together for one night.

07:32.076 --> 07:36.455
One night, just sex?
No strings attached?

07:36.664 --> 07:38.665
Yeah, yeah, we never had that.

07:38.875 --> 07:40.750
- No.
- No.

07:46.048 --> 07:49.092
Okay, this is getting a little crazy.

07:50.428 --> 07:52.012
Um, I mean...

07:52.221 --> 07:54.347
...I'm sure it would be amazing...

07:54.557 --> 07:57.809
...but I really don't think
it would be a good idea.

07:58.060 --> 07:59.895
I really...

08:00.605 --> 08:02.481
...really...

08:02.857 --> 08:04.483
...don't.

08:20.666 --> 08:22.334
What's up?

08:25.338 --> 08:27.255
What's up, dude?

08:27.882 --> 08:30.550
Take whatever you want,
just don't hurt me.

08:32.761 --> 08:35.639
You playing a little PlayStation, huh?

08:36.097 --> 08:37.849
That's wack.

08:39.559 --> 08:42.979
PlayStation is wack.

08:44.565 --> 08:47.567
What's up with the wack PlayStation,
what's up?

08:48.736 --> 08:50.028
Huh?

08:50.321 --> 08:52.948
Come on, am I 19 or what?

08:53.241 --> 08:57.619
Yes, on a scale of one to 10,
10 being the dumbest a person can look...

08:57.870 --> 08:59.829
...you are definitely 19.

09:01.290 --> 09:02.874
Come on, really. How old?

09:03.084 --> 09:05.669
Young. You're a man-child, okay?

09:05.878 --> 09:11.007
Now get changed, everybody's ready.
And please, please, keep my underwear.

09:11.801 --> 09:14.177
- Oh, thanks.
- Okay.

09:17.848 --> 09:20.392
- Joe.
- Yeah.

09:20.601 --> 09:21.643
Uh.

09:23.729 --> 09:26.439
You've had a lot of sex, right?

09:29.527 --> 09:31.528
When, today?

09:34.073 --> 09:36.199
Some, not a lot.

09:37.660 --> 09:41.705
The reason I'm asking
is because I had kind of a, uh...

09:41.956 --> 09:43.873
I was unable to...

09:44.041 --> 09:47.043
I really wanted to, but I couldn't...

09:47.670 --> 09:48.920
There, ha, hm.

09:49.130 --> 09:51.298
There was an incident.

09:52.758 --> 09:55.844
Don't worry about that, man. That happens.

09:56.304 --> 09:59.598
- It's happened to you?
- Yeah, once.

10:00.182 --> 10:03.893
- Well, what'd you do?
- I did it anyway.

10:07.732 --> 10:10.400
Phoebe, come on, let's go.

10:10.901 --> 10:12.694
Come on.

10:14.363 --> 10:15.864
Why aren't you dressed yet?

10:16.115 --> 10:18.617
I wrote the best song for your wedding.

10:18.868 --> 10:20.160
- Check this out.
- Phoeb.

10:20.494 --> 10:22.704
If you get ready now, you can play.

10:22.913 --> 10:23.997
- Really?!
- Yes.

10:24.206 --> 10:26.708
That's so exciting! Thanks, Mon.

10:26.959 --> 10:31.546
But if you touch my guitar again,
I'll have to pound on you a little bit.

10:32.048 --> 10:34.716
Fair enough. Get ready. I'll get everybody.

10:34.925 --> 10:36.885
Finally we can start celebrating my...

10:41.682 --> 10:44.851
I'm sorry, apparently I opened
the door to the past.

10:50.691 --> 10:53.818
Okay, Monica, Mon.
Okay, what you just saw...

10:54.070 --> 10:57.781
Can I ask you just a little question?
Why tonight?

10:59.116 --> 11:01.785
- What?
- I waited my whole life to be engaged.

11:01.952 --> 11:05.121
And unlike some,
I only plan on doing this once.

11:07.124 --> 11:12.253
Maybe it's selfish, I'm sorry, but I hoped
tonight could just be about that.

11:12.463 --> 11:14.255
- Oh, honey, but it is.
- No, it's not.

11:14.465 --> 11:16.883
Now it's about you getting back together.

11:17.093 --> 11:19.761
See, you kind of stole my thunder.

11:20.680 --> 11:24.599
We did not steal your thunder.
We are not getting back together.

11:24.850 --> 11:28.103
- Yeah, no, and nobody even saw.
- Yeah.

11:29.605 --> 11:31.106
That's true.

11:31.732 --> 11:34.025
- We just kissed.
- It was just a kiss.

11:34.276 --> 11:35.527
You guys kissed?

11:37.530 --> 11:39.406
What does this mean?

11:39.615 --> 11:42.575
Are you back together?
Can I sing at your wedding?

11:43.953 --> 11:45.829
Thunder being stolen.

11:46.038 --> 11:49.624
- Phoebe, it's nothing.
- Let's not make a big deal of this.

11:49.875 --> 11:52.794
It was a one-time thing.
It doesn't even matter.

11:53.045 --> 11:54.379
Oh, my God.

11:56.424 --> 11:59.217
I cannot believe you guys
are talking about this.

11:59.427 --> 12:02.303
Problems in the bedroom
are between a man and woman.

12:04.181 --> 12:07.892
All right? Now, Chandler
is doing the best he can.

12:11.105 --> 12:14.149
I don't think that's
what they were talking about.

12:14.942 --> 12:18.111
What a great night.
Chandler can't do it, they kissed.

12:18.446 --> 12:20.739
- What?
- You guys kissed? This is huge.

12:20.948 --> 12:22.031
No, it's not huge.

12:22.283 --> 12:25.160
People thinking it's huge
has led Monica to believe...

12:25.411 --> 12:27.620
...we're stealing her thunder,
which we aren't.

12:28.164 --> 12:29.748
We're still talking about it.

12:29.999 --> 12:32.834
That, and Chandler's problem.

12:33.961 --> 12:35.670
Monica, listen, listen.

12:35.880 --> 12:39.549
Would you feel better if we stopped
talking about Ross and Rachel?

12:39.759 --> 12:41.634
- That would be lovely.
- You got it.

12:41.886 --> 12:44.846
Now, I can pass for 19, right?

12:45.431 --> 12:47.015
Yes, you can pass for 19.

12:47.224 --> 12:48.725
- Really?
- Yes.

12:49.185 --> 12:50.977
- Seriously?
- Seriously?

12:51.228 --> 12:56.191
Seriously, no. Okay? You can play
your own age, which is 31.

12:59.320 --> 13:00.987
I'm 30!

13:02.573 --> 13:04.616
Joey, you are not. You're 31.

13:06.076 --> 13:07.535
Oh, crap!

13:08.788 --> 13:12.957
So, the Plaza. We'll get some mai tais?
Maybe no more for you though.

13:16.003 --> 13:19.255
You know, I think I don't feel like
going to the Plaza.

13:19.465 --> 13:21.216
- Why?
- This is ridiculous.

13:21.717 --> 13:25.929
I don't want to talk about it.
I don't. Especially with you.

13:27.973 --> 13:30.141
Pssh. That is wack.

13:40.778 --> 13:42.153
Yeah?

13:43.656 --> 13:45.240
I'll play it at the wedding.

13:45.449 --> 13:48.868
Yeah, well, we'll see if they
actually let you play, huh?

13:49.119 --> 13:51.454
They tell you anything you want to hear...

13:51.705 --> 13:53.373
...like, "You look 19."

13:53.624 --> 13:57.502
Then they just take it away,
like, "No, you don't."

13:58.754 --> 14:00.713
Monica won't take this away.

14:01.423 --> 14:03.675
- Wouldn't she?
- Would she?

14:04.426 --> 14:06.052
Would she?

14:10.140 --> 14:11.808
You ate my candy bar!

14:16.647 --> 14:18.481
Guess who.

14:19.275 --> 14:20.358
Hey.

14:20.526 --> 14:24.696
Hey, I just realized we kind of left
some stuff up in the air.

14:25.030 --> 14:26.364
What did Monica mean:

14:26.615 --> 14:28.741
"I don't want to talk,"
especially with me?

14:28.993 --> 14:31.953
Why not especially you and me?
We were both kissing.

14:32.329 --> 14:33.413
Still thinking about it?

14:33.664 --> 14:37.125
I'm serious. What did she mean by that?
"Especially you."

14:37.334 --> 14:39.294
- Oh, who cares?
- I care.

14:39.503 --> 14:41.588
And so do I.

14:44.842 --> 14:47.218
I have to talk to her.
Will you let me get changed?

14:47.469 --> 14:49.512
Okay, sure.

14:51.557 --> 14:53.558
Am I going to let you watch me?

14:53.767 --> 14:54.893
No.

14:56.854 --> 14:59.314
I can't believe her. It's just so typical.

14:59.565 --> 15:03.860
I know you're upset, but don't forget
there is going to be a wedding.

15:04.069 --> 15:08.156
You are going to throw the bouquet,
and then a honeymoon.

15:08.407 --> 15:11.826
- Maybe in Paris.
- Paris?

15:12.036 --> 15:16.664
We will take a moonlit walk
on the Rue de la blah-blah-blah.

15:19.919 --> 15:21.002
Keep talking.

15:21.211 --> 15:24.339
We will sprinkle rose petals
on the bed and make love...

15:24.548 --> 15:29.135
...not just because it's romantic,
but because I can.

15:30.721 --> 15:31.971
I love you.

15:32.181 --> 15:33.723
Mmm.

15:38.479 --> 15:40.521
Bonjour, monsieur.

15:42.858 --> 15:45.860
Don't say anything,
you might scare it away.

15:48.030 --> 15:50.573
It's Paris. Who knows we're here?

15:54.119 --> 15:55.870
Hi, Pheebs. What's up?

15:56.080 --> 15:59.540
You said I could sing at your wedding,
so I need a small deposit.

16:01.168 --> 16:04.379
- What?
- Good-faith money to hold the date.

16:04.588 --> 16:06.798
We're not giving you a deposit
for our wedding.

16:07.341 --> 16:09.759
Oh, I see.

16:11.720 --> 16:13.721
They break your heart, don't they?

16:15.015 --> 16:17.850
You know, I don't really need
their permission.

16:18.060 --> 16:21.104
You want to sing at their wedding,
sing at their wedding.

16:21.313 --> 16:24.107
Yeah, and if you want to look 19, then you...

16:24.316 --> 16:26.943
You got to do something about your eyes.

16:27.152 --> 16:28.945
What's wrong with my eyes?

16:29.154 --> 16:32.490
They give you away.
There's too much wisdom in there.

16:36.412 --> 16:39.080
Put some tea bags on them for 15 minutes.

16:39.289 --> 16:42.709
- That'll get rid of my wisdom?
- Maybe 10 minutes for you.

16:45.587 --> 16:49.215
Give her the deposit,
give her the ring. I don't care.

16:52.803 --> 16:55.555
- Yes?
- What did you mean when you said...

16:55.806 --> 16:58.599
...you didn't want to talk to anyone,
especially me?

16:58.809 --> 17:03.396
What a great apology.
And you accept it. Bye-bye.

17:04.772 --> 17:08.233
No, seriously, what was
the "especially me" part about?

17:08.444 --> 17:11.112
Let's just say it's not the first time
you've stolen my thunder.

17:11.363 --> 17:12.446
Wha?

17:12.656 --> 17:14.741
Hey, here's a thought...

17:15.742 --> 17:18.036
Monica, what are you talking about?

17:18.244 --> 17:21.414
My sweet 16. You went to third base
with my cousin Charlie.

17:21.623 --> 17:23.875
Ah, third base.

17:24.917 --> 17:27.127
It was all everybody could talk about.

17:27.337 --> 17:31.340
The only reason I did that
was because your party was so boring.

17:32.843 --> 17:35.094
- We had a caricaturist.
- Oh.

17:37.097 --> 17:40.600
Whenever I get married
Guess who won't be asked to sing

17:40.851 --> 17:45.271
Somebody named Geller
And somebody else named Bing

17:49.068 --> 17:52.653
Monica, your sweet 16
was like a million years ago.

17:52.863 --> 17:54.614
Yet here you are doing it again.

17:54.823 --> 17:57.158
Oh, I don't want to steal your stupid thunder.

17:57.409 --> 18:00.244
Why else would you have
made out with Ross?

18:00.454 --> 18:02.538
Got me.

18:03.499 --> 18:07.585
Easy, mimey, the moment has passed.
It ain't gonna happen.

18:09.338 --> 18:11.422
It'd be nice if I could have this night.

18:11.632 --> 18:13.841
I never wanted any part of your night.

18:14.051 --> 18:15.635
No one was supposed to see us.

18:15.844 --> 18:19.555
Is that why you did it in the secret hallway,
where nobody ever goes?

18:21.183 --> 18:22.975
Uh, Rachel, I've been thinking.

18:23.185 --> 18:27.522
I don't think us getting together
tonight is such a good idea.

18:27.773 --> 18:29.899
I'm calling it off.

18:31.318 --> 18:34.153
Way to save your dignity, my man.

18:34.905 --> 18:39.659
Mon, why, why would I ever want
to take away from your night?

18:39.868 --> 18:42.453
I don't know, maybe you feel
a little resentful.

18:42.704 --> 18:45.414
Maybe you thought you'd get married first.

18:45.582 --> 18:46.874
Maybe you can't stand...

18:47.042 --> 18:50.211
...that your formerly fat friend
is getting married first.

18:50.420 --> 18:54.757
Oh, wow, that... You know what?
That is so unfair.

18:55.008 --> 18:57.593
Now I want to steal your thunder.

18:57.761 --> 19:00.263
Come on, Ross. Let's go have sex!

19:09.690 --> 19:13.067
I can't believe you're gonna have sex
on my engagement night.

19:13.277 --> 19:14.986
Well, somebody should.

19:18.157 --> 19:20.074
Look, if we're gonna do this...

19:20.284 --> 19:22.869
We're not. She's just gonna think we are.

19:23.078 --> 19:25.288
I see, so everybody wins.

19:28.083 --> 19:29.792
- Who is it?
- It's Monica, open up.

19:30.002 --> 19:33.629
Okay, Ross, stop it. Please, wait a minute.

19:34.965 --> 19:36.757
Ow!

19:37.134 --> 19:39.135
Yeah, you like that, baby?

19:42.848 --> 19:44.056
May we help you?

19:44.725 --> 19:49.187
I wanted to say I hope you have sex,
and I hope you get back together.

19:49.438 --> 19:52.481
I warn you, the night
you announce your engagement...

19:52.691 --> 19:55.443
...I'm going to announce
that I'm pregnant.

19:55.819 --> 19:58.696
How is that ever going to happen?

19:58.947 --> 20:01.741
Do you want to know why
I was with Ross tonight?

20:01.992 --> 20:03.284
- I know why.
- You don't.

20:03.493 --> 20:06.662
- Okay, why?
- Because I was sad.

20:07.289 --> 20:08.331
What do you mean?

20:08.790 --> 20:11.667
Look, I am so...

20:11.877 --> 20:15.213
...so happy for you guys.

20:15.422 --> 20:19.217
But you getting married reminds me
of the fact that I'm not.

20:19.468 --> 20:20.927
I'm not even close.

20:21.136 --> 20:24.263
Maybe I just wanted
to make myself feel better.

20:24.473 --> 20:27.558
I know that that's dumb,
but you were so depressed...

20:27.809 --> 20:30.269
...when Ross got married,
you slept with Chandler.

20:32.481 --> 20:35.233
I don't care, she slept with me.

20:36.109 --> 20:40.696
Anyway, sweetie,
I am so sorry I ruined your night.

20:42.324 --> 20:45.576
I'm sorry I almost made you sleep with Ross.

20:50.874 --> 20:52.917
I'm gonna take off.

20:54.878 --> 20:57.463
- Congratulations, man.
- Thanks.

20:57.631 --> 20:59.715
- And Rachel.
- Yeah.

20:59.925 --> 21:01.008
What can I say?

21:01.218 --> 21:03.010
You missed your chance.

21:03.262 --> 21:08.391
From now on, the only person who's
going to enjoy these bad boys is me.

21:18.068 --> 21:20.861
We thought Phoebe would leave

21:21.071 --> 21:23.906
But she just stayed and stayed

21:24.157 --> 21:26.409
That's right, I'm here all night

21:26.660 --> 21:28.202
And Chandler will never get...

21:28.412 --> 21:30.997
Hey, here's a dollar.

21:31.248 --> 21:34.041
Consider it a deposit.
Please sing at our wedding.

21:34.251 --> 21:36.377
- Oh, thank you.
- Okay.

21:37.170 --> 21:40.381
Now who will perform the ceremony?

21:40.590 --> 21:42.133
Who will perform the cer...?

21:42.301 --> 21:43.634
Oh, oh.

21:46.346 --> 21:48.597
I'll pound on him in the morning.
