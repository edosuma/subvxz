I never understood that about my dad.

11:21.416 --> 11:23.416
At least not until after he was gone.

11:24.541 --> 11:26.583
[sighs] I didn't mean to blow up at him.

11:26.666 --> 11:29.291
But he has to realize I'm grown-up now.

11:30.291 --> 11:31.708
Maybe you need to tell him that.

11:41.500 --> 11:42.500
[sighs]

11:45.291 --> 11:48.541
[sighs] Why did you have to grow up?

11:48.625 --> 11:50.791
Things were easier then.

11:52.416 --> 11:54.916
Ah, yes. I could use a hug.

11:55.000 --> 11:56.833
Wait a minute. What is this?

11:56.916 --> 11:59.750
[grunting]

11:59.833 --> 12:02.208
[straining] Someone! Anyone!

12:02.291 --> 12:03.291
I can't--

12:03.958 --> 12:05.833
Natasha!

12:05.916 --> 12:07.583
Dad. Dad!

12:07.666 --> 12:10.000
We need to-- Dad?

12:14.875 --> 12:15.791
Dad?

12:19.041 --> 12:20.041
Dad!

12:20.833 --> 12:24.125
Sorry, how did we get
on the subject of Santa Claus?

12:24.208 --> 12:26.916
Ah, yes. The legend of Kris Kringle.

12:27.000 --> 12:29.458
One of my father's favorite bedtime tales.

12:29.541 --> 12:33.958
Putting tiny little swords and axes under
the pillows of all the children of Asgard.

12:35.000 --> 12:38.791
Whoa! Yeah, well,
Steve over here still believes in Santa.

12:38.875 --> 12:41.125
I might still hold a candle. [chuckles]

12:41.208 --> 12:43.541
Please tell me you still leave out
milk and cookies.

12:44.083 --> 12:46.000
Let me get this straight.
We have a Norse god,

12:46.083 --> 12:49.125
a man whose heart powers his armor suit,
a giant green man,

12:49.208 --> 12:50.791
but Santa is the reach?

12:50.875 --> 12:52.208
That's the bridge too far?

12:52.291 --> 12:54.291
[grunts]

12:55.541 --> 12:58.125
-Isn't that against the rules?
-Nope.

12:58.208 --> 12:59.666
Something happened to my dad.

12:59.750 --> 13:02.541
I-I found his phone on the floor,
but there's no sign of him.

13:02.625 --> 13:05.041
Tower security didn't log
Red Guardian leaving.

13:05.125 --> 13:07.250
But it did just log someone arriving.

13:07.333 --> 13:10.625
Red Guardian did not leave. He was taken.

13:10.708 --> 13:12.041
T'Challa?

13:12.125 --> 13:14.125
Apologies for my unannounced arrival.

13:14.208 --> 13:16.291
But I fear my most recent investigation

13:16.375 --> 13:18.750
may be connected
with Black Widow's father.

13:18.833 --> 13:21.750
I was pursuing
the villain known as Red Ghost.

13:25.083 --> 13:27.375
Here to stop me, Black Panther?

13:27.458 --> 13:30.583
[laughs]
Another game of cat and mouse, is it?

13:30.666 --> 13:33.208
Except this time, there is no mouse.

13:33.291 --> 13:36.000
There is only I, the Red Ghost.

13:36.083 --> 13:37.708
Drop the vibranium.

13:37.791 --> 13:40.291
I have better idea. Hear me out.

13:40.375 --> 13:42.833
-You run for your life.
-[weapon powering up]

13:42.916 --> 13:45.208
[laughs]

13:45.833 --> 13:48.458
Oh. You were so close.

13:48.541 --> 13:52.458
But no one gets the drop on the Red Ghost.

13:52.541 --> 13:54.583
-[laughs]
-[Black Panther grunts]

13:57.916 --> 14:01.541
By the time he gets downstairs,
I will be long gone.

14:01.625 --> 14:03.375
-[window shatters]
-What?

14:04.833 --> 14:06.000
Are you serious?

14:07.916 --> 14:09.750
[panting]

14:10.458 --> 14:11.791
[panting] Huh?

14:12.916 --> 14:17.083
[grunts, panting]
No one gets the drop on--

14:17.166 --> 14:19.333
[screams]

14:25.333 --> 14:27.291
[Black Panther]
Red Ghost could not have escaped

14:27.375 --> 14:30.000
under such mysterious circumstances.

14:30.083 --> 14:33.500
And he would not have left
the vibranium behind. Not willingly.

14:33.583 --> 14:35.625
And you didn't see who got him?

14:35.708 --> 14:40.291
No. But whoever or whatever took him
left behind this.

14:40.375 --> 14:44.541
The material is technologically beyond
anything that we have seen on Earth.

14:44.625 --> 14:47.041
Red Ghost disappeared,
so did Red Guardian.

14:47.125 --> 14:49.500
And no one's seen any sign of Red Skull.

14:49.583 --> 14:51.500
Weird coincidence.

14:51.583 --> 14:54.250
-[beeps]
-I have discovered a peculiar commonality

14:54.333 --> 14:56.291
beyond the three missing individuals.

14:56.375 --> 14:57.708
-Observe.
-Whoa!

14:57.791 --> 14:59.625
Omega Red, Red Raven,

14:59.708 --> 15:02.333
Red 9, Red Stone, Red Shift,

15:02.416 --> 15:03.500
Red King?

15:03.583 --> 15:06.291
So, what's the connection?

15:06.375 --> 15:08.625
Hulk, they all have the word "red"
in their names.

15:08.708 --> 15:10.083
And they're all marked missing.

15:10.166 --> 15:12.000
-Not all of them.
-[beeps]

15:12.083 --> 15:13.291
[Iron Man] Red She-Hulk?

15:13.375 --> 15:16.125
The only superpowered individual
with "red" in their name

15:16.208 --> 15:17.541
who has not vanished.

15:17.625 --> 15:20.541
Um… I might know where to find her.

15:20.625 --> 15:23.916
Good. She might be our only lead
to finding my dad.

15:25.208 --> 15:26.208
[Red Guardian grunting]

15:26.291 --> 15:28.125
-[punches landing]
-[Red Ghost] Can you get out?

15:28.208 --> 15:31.583
-[Red Skull grunts] No!
-[grunts]

15:31.666 --> 15:34.041
What is this? Where are we?

15:34.125 --> 15:37.375
Ah, good. You're awake.

15:37.458 --> 15:40.208
Red Ghost, Red Guardian, Red Skull.

15:40.291 --> 15:42.875
It's nice to finally meet you in person.

15:42.958 --> 15:45.500
And you've met my robots already.

15:46.291 --> 15:47.250
Huh?

15:49.041 --> 15:50.291
Broken?

15:50.375 --> 15:51.375
Broken?

15:52.083 --> 15:56.666
[sighs] Bumps you down
from near mint to very fine.

15:57.166 --> 15:59.583
-[grunts] Not worth keeping.
-[device beeps]

16:01.250 --> 16:02.875
Red Guardian.

16:02.958 --> 16:07.625
Not exactly a spring chicken anymore,
but I like the look of you.

16:07.708 --> 16:09.541
Oh, thank you.

16:09.625 --> 16:12.583
People think it's about exercise,
but, uh… [chuckles]

16:12.666 --> 16:16.291
…it really comes down
to calories in, calories out.

16:16.375 --> 16:20.625
Yes, you are in magnificent condition.

16:20.708 --> 16:26.625
[laughing]

16:26.708 --> 16:28.208
[grunting]

16:28.291 --> 16:33.166
-[Red Skull] Stop!
-[all screaming]

16:34.916 --> 16:36.458
[hawk cries]

16:37.000 --> 16:40.666
[Iron Man] Old West ghost town. Charming.
Didn't know these were still around.

16:40.750 --> 16:45.166
All right, guys. When we get
to Red She-Hulk, let me do the talking.

16:45.250 --> 16:48.416
Before today, I did not know
there were other Hulks out there.

16:48.500 --> 16:50.083
Are you close to Red She-Hulk?

16:50.166 --> 16:51.791
She's my ex-girlfriend.

16:51.875 --> 16:54.333
Sorry. She's your ex?

16:54.416 --> 16:55.916
No, no, no. It's fine.

16:56.000 --> 16:58.083
Betty and I ended things on good terms.

16:58.166 --> 17:01.458
-[grunts]
-[Iron Man] That good, huh?

17:01.541 --> 17:03.791
Uh, looks like you missed me, Betts.
[chuckles]

17:03.875 --> 17:06.333
Maybe next time I won't, Bruce.

17:06.416 --> 17:07.750
What are you doing here?

17:07.833 --> 17:09.791
Well, um, uh--

17:09.875 --> 17:12.208
Well, the thing is--
[stammers] You look great, by the way.

17:12.291 --> 17:14.416
Uh, that-- Um, well…

17:14.500 --> 17:17.458
[sighs]
You're starting to make me angry, Bruce.

17:17.541 --> 17:19.041
Spit it out. [grunts]

17:22.791 --> 17:27.500
Whatever. I'm on demo duty for my dad,
so I'm gonna get back to smashing.

17:28.875 --> 17:30.041
I'll go talk to her.

17:30.875 --> 17:32.791
Do you want me to go with you?

17:32.875 --> 17:34.916
-No.
-Ah, that's probably a good idea.

17:35.000 --> 17:38.125
Betty, people with the word "red"
in their name are disappearing.

17:38.208 --> 17:39.458
Possibly being taken.

17:39.541 --> 17:41.000
What's that got to do with me?

17:41.083 --> 17:42.750
Red She-Hulk?

17:42.833 --> 17:44.375
-Red?
-Yeah?

17:44.458 --> 17:47.166
Well, nobody's disappearing me.

17:47.250 --> 17:49.916
My dad is one of the ones missing.

17:55.041 --> 17:56.166
Red Guardian.

17:56.666 --> 17:59.833
He and I got into this big argument,
and I blew up at him.

17:59.916 --> 18:02.791
I'm going to find him, but-- [sighs]

18:02.875 --> 18:05.166
Honestly, I'm still a little mad at him.

18:05.250 --> 18:08.958
Look, it's not always easy to talk
to your old man.

18:09.041 --> 18:10.750
My dad can be a real hothead.

18:11.291 --> 18:13.916
Always trying to boss me around.
Telling me what to do.

18:14.583 --> 18:15.875
No, my dad's different.

18:15.958 --> 18:20.375
He's-- [stammers] He's supportive
and positive and always around.

18:20.875 --> 18:22.750
Then what's the problem?

18:22.833 --> 18:25.958
Problem is he treats me
like a little girl.

18:26.041 --> 18:28.958
I'm not a kid anymore,
and I don't think my dad can accept that.

18:29.041 --> 18:31.916
Listen, you're not perfect.
Neither is your dad.

18:32.000 --> 18:33.833
You have to accept that he's human.

18:33.916 --> 18:35.916
So what if he still sees you as a kid?

18:36.000 --> 18:37.916
Why does that bother you so much?

18:38.000 --> 18:40.291
[whooshing]

18:44.916 --> 18:46.208
Are these with you?

18:46.708 --> 18:48.458
-No.
-[chuckles] Good.

18:48.958 --> 18:50.625
Those would be mine.

18:50.708 --> 18:52.666
Sorry they aren't in the best of shape.

18:52.750 --> 18:55.541
[scoffs]
Too scuffed up to be collectibles.

18:55.625 --> 18:58.458
But they can do my dirty work.

18:58.541 --> 19:00.708
[laughs, sighs]

19:00.791 --> 19:03.875
What a magnificent hue.

19:04.666 --> 19:07.291
You're the one responsible. Who are you?

19:07.375 --> 19:09.125
And what did you do with my dad?

19:09.208 --> 19:15.958
Oh, I'm just an extraordinary fellow
who has it all, and it's still not enough.

19:16.583 --> 19:18.750
I'm the Collector.

19:19.416 --> 19:23.333
As for the other question,
Red Guardian is now part

19:23.416 --> 19:28.750
of the most magnificent collection
in the known universe.

19:28.833 --> 19:30.416
I want him back. Now.

19:30.500 --> 19:32.791
[grunts, shouts]

19:33.416 --> 19:34.625
[grunts]

19:35.666 --> 19:37.458
I love the anger.

19:37.541 --> 19:39.291
That is so mint.

19:39.375 --> 19:43.041
Don't damage the red one,
but the rest? Take 'em apart!

19:44.875 --> 19:46.666
-[both grunt]
-[Hulk grunts]

19:53.125 --> 19:54.250
All righty then.

19:54.333 --> 19:56.583
I'll crank up the juice
and bring the pain.

19:56.666 --> 19:57.875
[weapons hum]

20:00.208 --> 20:02.500
[grunts] Ow.

20:05.500 --> 20:06.666
Keep it busy.

20:06.750 --> 20:08.250
I'm gonna try something.

20:09.291 --> 20:12.625
[grunting, sighs]

20:12.708 --> 20:13.833
That all you've got?

20:13.916 --> 20:16.916
I've fought grandmas
with tougher stuff than you.

20:18.125 --> 20:19.333
[grunts]

20:20.416 --> 20:21.750
[grunts, shouts]

20:25.583 --> 20:26.583
Hey, Collector!

20:26.666 --> 20:28.958
Nice look. Very alt-rock.

20:29.041 --> 20:32.541
-How do you feel about heavy metal?
-[thunder rumbling]

20:36.166 --> 20:38.791
[grunts] Always fashionably late.

20:38.875 --> 20:41.416
[grunting]

20:42.958 --> 20:44.291
[grunts]

20:44.375 --> 20:47.666
I'm gonna smash your ugly face.
Then your ugly face!

20:47.750 --> 20:50.666
And then-- Yikes, there are a lot of you.

20:50.750 --> 20:52.708
[straining]

20:54.125 --> 20:55.250
Don't worry, Betts!

20:55.333 --> 20:56.916
I got ya-- [shouts]

20:57.000 --> 20:58.250
[bricks clattering]

20:58.333 --> 20:59.791
[sighs] Typical.

20:59.875 --> 21:00.958
[grunts]

21:01.458 --> 21:02.625
[laughs]

21:03.208 --> 21:04.208
We need a plan.

21:04.750 --> 21:08.833
Thor, call a lightning strike,
aimed at this exact location.

21:08.916 --> 21:10.708
But lightning? Right here?

21:10.791 --> 21:12.541
Won't that vaporize us?

21:12.625 --> 21:14.583
I mean, not me. I'd obviously be fine.

21:14.666 --> 21:16.166
But the rest of you?

21:17.000 --> 21:19.458
-Now, Thor!
-[grunts]

21:27.333 --> 21:29.125
[chuckles]

21:29.208 --> 21:30.250
Nice.

21:30.333 --> 21:31.333
[grunts]

21:32.750 --> 21:34.500
Wait. They're gone?

21:35.083 --> 21:38.083
And so is my only chance
at finding my dad.

21:42.041 --> 21:43.500
[beeps]

21:43.583 --> 21:45.791
No sign of the Collector
on any of our scanners.

21:45.875 --> 21:48.291
And nothing
on the Wakandan channels as well.

21:48.375 --> 21:49.791
Anyone have any ideas?

21:49.875 --> 21:52.875
To find him,
we need someone with special skills.

21:53.625 --> 21:54.625
A tracker.

21:54.708 --> 21:56.625
Steve and I worked with him a while back.

21:56.708 --> 21:59.000
Yep. S.H.I.E.L.D. file 268.

21:59.083 --> 22:00.333
He can find anyone.

22:00.416 --> 22:02.500
Oh, no! No, no, no, no, no.

22:02.583 --> 22:05.541
No, not that guy. Anyone but that guy.

22:05.625 --> 22:07.083
He's the best at what he does.

22:07.166 --> 22:09.666
And what he does isn't very nice.

22:13.416 --> 22:15.666
-[sizzling]
-[snikt]

22:15.750 --> 22:16.750
[Black Widow] Wolverine.

22:18.666 --> 22:22.125
[groans]
Guess I'm not gonna get to eat my lunch.

22:26.625 --> 22:28.000
[sniffs, groans]

22:28.083 --> 22:29.166
Stay on this heading.

22:29.250 --> 22:33.041
You can track the Collector
from this high up, at this distance?

22:33.125 --> 22:34.875
My nose doesn't lie.

22:34.958 --> 22:39.541
Collector might be untraceable,
but Red She-Hulk leaves a scent.

22:39.625 --> 22:41.958
I can smell a Hulk from a mile away.

22:42.041 --> 22:43.750
-[growls]
-What?

22:43.833 --> 22:47.416
Maybe try smashing
a deodorant factory once in a while.

22:47.500 --> 22:51.041
[sniffs] Take us down here. This is it.

23:00.791 --> 23:01.791
[sniffs]

23:02.375 --> 23:03.375
Over here.

23:07.500 --> 23:08.500
[sniffs]

23:08.583 --> 23:10.250
Do you have a lock on my dad?

23:10.333 --> 23:13.041
[sniffs] Picking up multiple scents.

23:13.125 --> 23:14.333
Red She-Hulk and--

23:14.416 --> 23:16.166
[sniffs] Wait a second--

23:16.250 --> 23:18.000
[sniffs] Red Skull?

23:18.083 --> 23:21.833
The plan is to free everyone
from the Collector. Everyone.

23:21.916 --> 23:24.875
You didn't say anything
about saving villains.

23:24.958 --> 23:29.791
For all I care, the Collector can keep
the Red Ghost and Red Skull and…

23:29.875 --> 23:31.541
[sniffs, grunts]

23:31.625 --> 23:32.916
Omega Red?

23:33.000 --> 23:34.916
-You know him?
-[grunts]

23:35.000 --> 23:37.166
Omega Red is the worst.

23:37.250 --> 23:39.625
He just sucks the life out of you.

23:39.708 --> 23:41.125
Just get us to the Collector.

23:41.208 --> 23:43.041
[groans] Follow me.

23:45.125 --> 23:48.333
The place is called Mom's Diner.
That's just adorable.

23:48.416 --> 23:50.250
It's probably a death trap.

23:50.333 --> 23:52.166
Can't be worse than
where you get your hair cut.

23:52.250 --> 23:53.250
[groans]

23:53.333 --> 23:55.666
-[bell dings]
-Scent ends here.

24:00.083 --> 24:01.083
Spread out.

24:01.166 --> 24:03.166
Look for a hidden door or exit.

24:19.166 --> 24:21.416
-Anybody want lemonade?
-[clicks]

24:26.583 --> 24:28.583
Collector'll be down there,

24:28.666 --> 24:30.083
in Mom's basement.

24:34.916 --> 24:36.791
[Iron Man]
Definitely doesn't look like Earth tech.

24:36.875 --> 24:39.458
Hmm. I don't see any way down.

24:41.291 --> 24:43.750
[Iron Man] That's convenient. And ominous.

24:46.666 --> 24:48.791
My scanners have picked up
a hidden passageway

24:48.875 --> 24:50.875
to a deeper sublevel beneath us.

24:50.958 --> 24:51.958
This way.

24:57.458 --> 24:58.541
I'm coming, Dad.

25:00.125 --> 25:02.375
There better not be any secret door.

25:02.458 --> 25:04.791
I hate secret doors.

25:04.875 --> 25:06.416
-Always where you least expe--
-[clicks]

25:06.500 --> 25:09.250
[all screaming]

25:09.333 --> 25:11.625
[computer voice]
Potential new collectibles detected.

25:11.708 --> 25:14.541
Activate, clean, scan and sort functions.

25:15.500 --> 25:17.208
[all groaning]

25:18.083 --> 25:20.000
[computer voice] Initializing power wash.

25:20.708 --> 25:22.833
Did that just say power wash?

25:22.916 --> 25:23.875
[all gasp]

25:25.083 --> 25:27.416
[all coughing]

25:29.333 --> 25:30.458
[Hulk stammers] Whoa.

25:30.541 --> 25:32.250
[all grunting, groaning]

25:33.916 --> 25:35.166
[dryers blowing]

25:36.916 --> 25:39.541
Wow, this is a really nice blowout.

25:39.625 --> 25:41.000
Whew! Same.

25:41.083 --> 25:43.541
[all screaming]

25:43.625 --> 25:46.500
[computer voice]
Scanning complete. Identify and sort.

25:47.000 --> 25:50.291
Two armored robots
with scratches and surface damage.

25:50.375 --> 25:52.375
-Imperfect.
-[Iron Man] Imperfect?

25:52.458 --> 25:53.708
-[shouts]
-[Black Widow] Tony!

25:53.791 --> 25:56.500
[computer voice]
Identify and sort. Four humans.

25:56.583 --> 25:58.250
Identify and sort.

25:58.333 --> 25:59.375
Two animals.

25:59.458 --> 26:01.125
[both] Excuse me?

26:01.208 --> 26:02.750
[all shouting]

26:03.375 --> 26:04.375
[grunts]

26:04.916 --> 26:06.791
-[Hulk grunts]
-[groans]

26:10.916 --> 26:14.541
[groans] This entire room stinks like…

26:15.250 --> 26:16.458
[sniffs] Oh, no.

26:16.541 --> 26:18.166
[growling]

26:18.250 --> 26:19.583
Is that a…

26:19.666 --> 26:22.500
Wendigo! [growls]

26:23.041 --> 26:24.083
[Wolverine grunts]

26:24.166 --> 26:27.083
-[growls]
-[roars]

26:27.166 --> 26:28.458
[both grunting]

26:32.833 --> 26:34.416
-[chuckles] Soft.
-[growling]

26:34.500 --> 26:37.458
-Like wrestling a big, fluffy pillow.
-[groans]

26:38.166 --> 26:40.000
-[Wendigo growls]
-Uh-oh.

26:40.083 --> 26:41.791
Fluffy pillow's fightin' back.

26:41.875 --> 26:43.458
-[Wendigo growling]
-[groans]

26:46.666 --> 26:49.458
Hate stupid fluffy pillow!

26:49.541 --> 26:52.083
-[growls]
-[Wolverine grunts]

26:52.166 --> 26:53.458
[Wendigo growls]

26:53.541 --> 26:55.041
[groans, grunts]

26:58.875 --> 27:00.916
-[snikt]
-[growls]

27:01.000 --> 27:04.333
Okay, bub, you've taken your best shot.

27:04.416 --> 27:05.958
Now, it's my turn.

27:06.041 --> 27:08.416
[Wendigo growling]

27:09.625 --> 27:11.750
[Wolverine groaning, grunting]

27:11.833 --> 27:13.208
[growls]

27:13.291 --> 27:14.375
[Wendigo yelps]

27:14.458 --> 27:15.666
[grunts]

27:16.958 --> 27:19.666
[both panting]

27:19.750 --> 27:21.750
[Hulk] Wasn't as bad as I remembered.

27:21.833 --> 27:23.833
-[groans]
-You did pretty good there.

27:23.916 --> 27:26.875
[groans] Aw, thanks, man.

27:26.958 --> 27:29.916
[chuckles] I think I pulled a muscle,
but--

27:30.000 --> 27:32.416
[growling]

27:32.500 --> 27:34.666
[Hulk] More fluffy pillows!

27:35.166 --> 27:36.875
I hate fluffy pillows.

27:38.541 --> 27:39.791
[both screaming]

27:39.875 --> 27:41.500
[both groan]

27:42.416 --> 27:44.291
I did not see that coming.

27:44.375 --> 27:47.375
[machinery humming]

27:47.458 --> 27:48.958
Where's the rest of our team?

27:49.041 --> 27:52.125
-And why did the Collector send us here?
-We were scanned.

27:52.208 --> 27:55.583
The computer said
we were scratched and damaged.

27:55.666 --> 27:57.541
They thought we were scrap.

27:57.625 --> 27:58.916
They underestimated us.

27:59.000 --> 28:00.625
My scanners cannot find an exit.

28:01.708 --> 28:04.250
[scanner beeping]

28:06.666 --> 28:08.625
No exit? Not a problem.

28:08.708 --> 28:10.083
We're gonna build our way out.

28:10.708 --> 28:12.833
[all screaming, groan]

28:12.916 --> 28:15.208
[groans] What are these things?

28:15.291 --> 28:17.208
Power-inhibiting manacles.

28:17.291 --> 28:18.750
Uh, they jam our powers.

28:18.833 --> 28:21.125
These must be a newer model.

28:21.958 --> 28:24.791
What? Have you never been captured,
thrown in prison

28:24.875 --> 28:27.000
and had your powers taken away before?

28:27.916 --> 28:28.791
-Nope.
-Nuh-uh.

28:28.875 --> 28:29.958
Can't say that I have.

28:30.041 --> 28:31.708
Just me? Huh.

28:31.791 --> 28:34.416
It's happened to me more times
than I care to--

28:34.500 --> 28:36.458
Really? Like, never?

28:36.541 --> 28:38.291
[footsteps approaching]

28:43.833 --> 28:46.666
Well, we found robots,
but not our friends.

28:46.750 --> 28:48.000
[Collector] Friends?

28:48.083 --> 28:49.916
Who cares about them?

28:50.708 --> 28:53.500
Check out my advanced bots.

28:53.583 --> 28:56.583
You may have bested my old ones
in the desert,

28:56.666 --> 28:59.208
but these are a bit more sturdy.

29:00.083 --> 29:03.916
Oh, the rare treasures
you're about to see.

29:04.000 --> 29:05.875
I don't care about any of this.

29:05.958 --> 29:07.416
I want my dad.

29:07.500 --> 29:08.916
I'll take you to him.

29:09.000 --> 29:11.333
Maybe along the way,
you could learn some manners.

29:15.541 --> 29:17.500
This is the magic.

29:17.583 --> 29:20.416
You see,
when you get to be as big a deal as I am,

29:20.500 --> 29:24.541
it's all about rare, one-of-a-kind,

29:24.625 --> 29:27.958
never made available to the public before.

29:28.041 --> 29:28.916
-[all gasp]
-Whoa.

29:29.000 --> 29:33.291
Behold, my collection.

29:33.375 --> 29:34.500
[lights clicking]

29:34.583 --> 29:36.166
The greatest ever,
complete, mint-condition,

29:36.250 --> 29:38.541
sealed
and climate-controlled acid-free Mylar.

29:40.083 --> 29:42.250
My good stuff is in storage,

29:42.333 --> 29:45.625
but this is the best
of what I've acquired here on Earth.

29:45.708 --> 29:49.041
[giggling]
Oh, you are going to be impressed by this.

29:50.583 --> 29:54.250
My mythical creatures of legend!

29:54.333 --> 29:55.333
Are they dead?

29:55.416 --> 29:57.625
[scoffs] Of course not.

29:57.708 --> 30:00.208
Suspended animation.

30:00.291 --> 30:05.791
Hibernation stasis,
in absolute mint condition.

30:08.458 --> 30:10.916
You kidnapped Santa Claus?

30:11.000 --> 30:12.083
I knew he was real.

30:12.166 --> 30:14.375
Come on, come on.
I have so much more to show you.

30:14.458 --> 30:16.750
[groans] Hey, wait.
Don't you know who that is?

30:17.250 --> 30:20.125
After completing those,
I tried collecting musicians,

30:20.208 --> 30:22.500
but you have no idea how hard it is

30:22.583 --> 30:24.875
to find rock stars
in halfway-decent condition.

30:24.958 --> 30:26.500
So, I branched out.

30:26.583 --> 30:31.000
Feast your eyes on my latest and greatest.

30:33.750 --> 30:35.833
My Red Collection!

30:36.541 --> 30:37.916
[Black Widow gasps]

30:39.791 --> 30:40.791
Dad!

30:40.875 --> 30:42.791
[groaning, grunting]

30:42.875 --> 30:43.875
Let go of me!

30:43.958 --> 30:46.583
The first color of the rainbow.

30:46.666 --> 30:48.416
Soon to be followed by others.

30:48.500 --> 30:51.041
Although,
it thins out between green and purple.

30:51.541 --> 30:53.041
Not sure why.

30:53.125 --> 30:55.208
Collector, you're completely mad.

30:55.291 --> 30:59.666
I'm super mad at you ungrateful casuals.

30:59.750 --> 31:03.541
You don't appreciate
the greatness in my collection.

31:04.375 --> 31:08.125
That's why I've decided to collect you.

31:08.208 --> 31:11.083
[all groaning]

31:11.166 --> 31:12.583
Relax.

31:12.666 --> 31:15.041
You'll be in a protective slab.

31:15.125 --> 31:17.125
Frozen in stasis.

31:17.208 --> 31:21.041
[grunts] Perfect forever.

31:23.583 --> 31:26.000
-Sam, can you fly out?
-[Sam straining]

31:26.083 --> 31:29.416
No can do! These inhibitors have
everything shut down.

31:30.583 --> 31:33.250
-[thud]
-[groans] Huh?

31:36.083 --> 31:38.541
You'll be part of my latest collection.

31:38.625 --> 31:40.750
My Avengers Collection.

31:43.125 --> 31:44.041
Dad.

31:44.541 --> 31:47.125
What about Red Guardian?
Where are you going to put him?

31:47.208 --> 31:49.708
He's already in my Red Collection.

31:49.791 --> 31:51.833
Then your collection's incomplete.

31:51.916 --> 31:53.708
If Red Guardian's with the Reds,

31:53.791 --> 31:56.583
then your Avengers Collection
will always have a hole in it.

31:56.666 --> 31:58.833
What? What are you talking about?

31:58.916 --> 32:00.916
Red Guardian is red.

32:01.000 --> 32:03.416
Red Guardian is an Avenger.

32:03.500 --> 32:06.083
No, he can't be-- You-- [scoffs]

32:06.166 --> 32:07.958
But he just-- Fine, whatever.

32:08.041 --> 32:10.625
-I'll just put him in both sets.
-Well, you can't do that.

32:10.708 --> 32:12.791
He's either in one collection
or the other,

32:12.875 --> 32:15.625
but one of them will never be complete.

32:15.708 --> 32:18.291
No! I have to file him under something!

32:18.375 --> 32:22.875
Do you have any idea how many spreadsheets
I have to keep track of all this?

32:24.375 --> 32:26.625
[rumbling]

32:26.708 --> 32:28.458
Wait, that's not the machine.

32:31.625 --> 32:33.333
Nobody puts us in the trash.

32:34.958 --> 32:37.583
-[shouts]
-At worst, we belong in recycling.

32:39.416 --> 32:40.833
Told you they were here.

32:40.916 --> 32:42.916
The nose never lies.

32:43.000 --> 32:44.875
-What happened?
-[spits]

32:44.958 --> 32:48.208
I don't wanna talk about it. [grunting]

32:48.291 --> 32:49.833
[Wolverine grunting]

32:51.208 --> 32:52.750
[groans]

32:56.875 --> 32:59.458
I think it's time to collect
a little payback.

33:00.875 --> 33:03.500
-[all grunting]
-Strike!

33:23.208 --> 33:24.416
Do your thing, Wolverine.

33:24.500 --> 33:26.083
[grunting]

33:27.166 --> 33:29.458
[groans] Where are we?

33:29.541 --> 33:32.708
Okay, you're inside the lair of an alien
who-- No, you know what?

33:32.791 --> 33:35.791
Someone will explain later.
Right now, we just need you to smash.

33:35.875 --> 33:36.833
I can manage that.

33:38.125 --> 33:40.250
Oh, and Santa is real!

33:41.000 --> 33:42.583
Santa's real, everybody.

33:45.125 --> 33:46.416
[gasps] Dad.

33:49.000 --> 33:50.375
[laser blasting]

33:50.458 --> 33:51.458
[beeps]

33:57.875 --> 34:00.375
[blades whirring]

34:01.541 --> 34:04.375
[roars]

34:04.875 --> 34:05.708
Uh-oh.

34:08.500 --> 34:11.291
[roars]

34:13.166 --> 34:14.916
And that's how it's done.

34:15.000 --> 34:16.125
You miss me, Betts?

34:16.208 --> 34:19.000
[giggles] Maybe. Just a little.

34:22.000 --> 34:24.625
Rescuing you feels wrong.

34:24.708 --> 34:26.666
Omega Red?

34:26.750 --> 34:29.041
Forget it. [groans]

34:29.125 --> 34:32.250
You're gonna try to convince me
this is the right thing to do.

34:32.333 --> 34:34.666
I don't have to. You already know it.

34:37.125 --> 34:38.125
[grunts]

34:38.916 --> 34:42.625
[gasps] My greatest foe!

34:42.708 --> 34:44.708
I knew you'd come!

34:44.791 --> 34:46.625
[laughs, snorts]

34:47.291 --> 34:51.291
Wait till I tell Sabretooth,
Deathstrike and Cyber, huh?

34:51.375 --> 34:53.375
They're never going to believe it.

34:53.458 --> 34:57.333
Old Wolvie has a heart after all,
am I right?

34:57.416 --> 35:01.125
[giggles] We should take a picture
to commemorate this.

35:01.208 --> 35:03.583
Hey, does anyone have a phone
we can borrow

35:03.666 --> 35:05.666
and maybe, like, a selfie stick?

35:05.750 --> 35:08.750
[groans] You are so exhausting.

35:08.833 --> 35:12.208
[gasps] My collection!

35:12.291 --> 35:14.166
My life's work!

35:14.250 --> 35:16.916
They're-- They're opening it!

35:17.000 --> 35:20.250
[groans] Wish I had time
to do an unboxing video,

35:20.333 --> 35:23.708
but I need to stop them
before they ruin everything!

35:23.791 --> 35:26.125
[grunting]

35:29.458 --> 35:30.375
There.

35:31.791 --> 35:33.125
[grunting]

35:35.291 --> 35:38.208
-[weapon powering up]
-[grunting]

35:42.000 --> 35:44.125
Hold on, Dad. [groaning]

35:46.250 --> 35:47.500
Whoa.

35:47.583 --> 35:50.625
Natasha, you managed to save me?

35:50.708 --> 35:52.291
Dad, I--

35:52.375 --> 35:53.375
What is it?

35:53.458 --> 35:54.916
-[rumbling]
-[groans]

35:55.708 --> 35:57.000
[Red Guardian groans]

35:57.083 --> 35:59.375
-Dad! [grunts]
-[groans]

36:00.333 --> 36:02.833
[Black Widow grunting]

36:02.916 --> 36:05.791
[grunts] Drop me. I'm too heavy.

36:05.875 --> 36:08.083
No! I can rescue you.

36:08.166 --> 36:11.250
[pants] Why-- Why won't you trust me?

36:11.333 --> 36:13.375
Of course I trust you.

36:13.458 --> 36:17.208
But I'm your papa.
It's my job to protect you.

36:17.291 --> 36:19.291
And I'm scared for you.

36:19.375 --> 36:20.583
I'm scared too.

36:21.083 --> 36:24.166
Papa, I think you liked me better
when I was little,

36:24.250 --> 36:25.791
but I'm not a kid anymore.

36:25.875 --> 36:28.833
And I'm scared you don't love me
for who I am now.

36:28.916 --> 36:32.125
Natasha, I could never stop loving you.

36:32.208 --> 36:36.000
I know I hover around like a helicopter,
but I can't help it.

36:36.083 --> 36:40.166
You're so grown up,
and you don't need me anymore.

36:40.250 --> 36:42.916
I don't know
how else to spend time with you.

36:45.291 --> 36:47.333
-[straining]
-[groans]

36:47.416 --> 36:49.250
It was so much simpler then.

36:49.875 --> 36:51.708
Remember when you were little?

36:52.208 --> 36:55.166
[laughing]
You and I used to make pancakes together.

36:55.250 --> 36:56.625
We still can.

36:56.708 --> 36:59.458
But, Papa, you need to let go.

36:59.541 --> 37:01.083
You want me to let go?

37:01.166 --> 37:02.583
No! No, no.

37:02.666 --> 37:05.750
You have to let go
of the idea that I'm a little girl.

37:05.833 --> 37:07.250
[beeping]

37:07.333 --> 37:08.666
[weapons powering up]

37:09.958 --> 37:11.375
Coming through!

37:12.583 --> 37:15.416
-[Black Widow grunting, groans]
-[Red Guardian grunts]

37:16.000 --> 37:18.833
Goodness, you're so strong now.

37:19.458 --> 37:22.500
[laughing] My Natasha.

37:25.916 --> 37:28.083
Must be something else I can use.

37:28.166 --> 37:29.375
Something that'll--

37:29.458 --> 37:31.208
Oh, this will do.

37:33.500 --> 37:34.333
[beeps]

37:36.250 --> 37:38.000
[roars]

37:39.000 --> 37:40.000
[groans]

37:41.625 --> 37:43.291
Is this the right way?

37:43.375 --> 37:44.375
[shouts]

37:45.416 --> 37:46.500
[Hulk grunts]

37:48.291 --> 37:49.291
[Wolverine] Heads up!

37:54.041 --> 37:55.875
-[grunts]
-[dragon roaring]

37:55.958 --> 37:57.083
What the--

-[grunts]

38:01.916 --> 38:03.166
[roars]

38:03.250 --> 38:04.166
Get down!

38:06.250 --> 38:08.666
[roaring]

38:10.125 --> 38:11.541
-[interface beeps]
-Game on.

38:16.916 --> 38:19.541
[grunting]

38:19.625 --> 38:22.333
[Santa] Ho ho ho!

38:22.416 --> 38:23.916
Hi-yah!

38:26.500 --> 38:29.833
[gasps]
Did you like the milk and cookies, Santa?

38:29.916 --> 38:32.500
Of course, I did, Steven.

38:32.583 --> 38:34.875
You've always been a good boy.

38:35.375 --> 38:36.708
Now, come along.

38:36.791 --> 38:40.041
Time to kick some butt, North Pole style.

38:40.125 --> 38:41.833
For the elves!

38:41.916 --> 38:44.791
-[groans]
-Santa! No!

38:46.333 --> 38:49.625
Ho! Nice try, dragon!

38:49.708 --> 38:51.416
But you've met your match.

38:51.500 --> 38:55.166
If I tamed Rudolph, I can tame you!

38:55.250 --> 38:59.958
-[grunting, laughs] Ho ho!
-[dragon growls]

39:06.500 --> 39:08.250
Do you want to finish this together?

39:08.333 --> 39:09.583
Are you sure?

39:09.666 --> 39:11.416
I'm not intruding?

39:11.500 --> 39:12.958
You're not intruding, Papa.

39:13.041 --> 39:15.291
Like I told the Collector,
you're an Avenger.

39:17.333 --> 39:18.916
[pants, grunting]

39:19.625 --> 39:21.708
[grunting] Yeah!

39:21.791 --> 39:26.375
[laughs] Flip it, flatten it,
just like making pancakes!

39:26.458 --> 39:28.500
Oh, you're doing great, Natasha!

39:28.583 --> 39:30.458
You make me proud!

39:31.333 --> 39:33.208
[Collector] Get away from there!

39:33.291 --> 39:34.333
[groans]

39:34.416 --> 39:35.458
Let him go!

39:35.541 --> 39:37.125
-[grunts]
-[Collector groans]

39:37.833 --> 39:43.583
[grunts] That machine
is more important than life itself.

39:43.666 --> 39:45.791
All it does is lock people up.

39:45.875 --> 39:48.291
No! It protects them!

39:48.375 --> 39:49.916
Can't you see?

39:50.000 --> 39:53.833
If we don't keep things in mint condition,
they change.

39:53.916 --> 39:56.791
But locked in a bubble, they won't change!

39:56.875 --> 39:58.916
They stay perfect!

39:59.500 --> 40:01.458
Stay perfect?

40:03.166 --> 40:05.583
So what if it changes?

40:05.666 --> 40:07.375
Still perfect.

40:08.125 --> 40:10.000
[grunts]

40:10.083 --> 40:11.583
No, no, no!

40:15.708 --> 40:16.708
My stuff!

40:19.208 --> 40:21.958
[groans] I hate this place!

40:22.041 --> 40:24.000
I hate this planet!

40:24.083 --> 40:26.291
I hate everything!

40:27.125 --> 40:29.958
Computer, we're leaving!

40:31.166 --> 40:33.125
[rumbling, cracking]

40:34.208 --> 40:36.708
[all screaming, panting]

40:36.791 --> 40:38.541
[Omega Red] I have to get out of here!

40:41.291 --> 40:42.291
Huh?

40:42.875 --> 40:44.875
[rumbling]

40:48.583 --> 40:51.750
Am I dizzy, or is the room moving?

40:51.833 --> 40:54.958
Worse than that. It's rising.
We need to get out of here.

40:57.250 --> 40:58.291
Panther and I have it.

41:02.125 --> 41:03.708
Hit the eject-- Now!

41:09.583 --> 41:11.291
-[Black Panther giggles]
-Path is clear!

41:11.375 --> 41:12.625
Everybody, out!

41:25.583 --> 41:26.833
[groaning]

41:37.875 --> 41:39.125
[all cheer]

41:39.208 --> 41:41.041
Whoa! You can't touch this.

41:47.750 --> 41:48.875
[shutter clicks]

41:50.833 --> 41:52.416
[Steve] All the bad guys secured.

41:52.500 --> 41:54.666
You did the right thing by saving them.

41:54.750 --> 41:56.166
And you made a new friend.

41:56.250 --> 41:58.666
Yoo-hoo! Wolvie!

41:59.833 --> 42:01.833
-[groans]
-[both chuckling]

42:05.333 --> 42:06.791

42:12.958 --> 42:15.041
[Hulk giggles] Yeah.

42:16.125 --> 42:18.958
-[Avengers chattering]
-Actually, this was, uh, Jarvis's recipe.

42:19.583 --> 42:20.583
More, please.

42:20.666 --> 42:22.416
Whoa, you got chocolate chips in this?

42:22.500 --> 42:24.250
-They're amazing.
-What is your recipe?

42:24.333 --> 42:26.583
These are the best pancakes
we've ever made, Dad.

42:27.625 --> 42:31.000
-[burps, laughs]
-[laughs]

42:31.083 --> 42:34.750
Have some more!
There is plenty for all. [laughs]

42:40.250 --> 42:42.416
It's mine! I don't wanna share!

42:42.500 --> 42:44.166
No. I'm not done with it yet.

42:44.250 --> 42:46.041
You're the worst!

42:46.125 --> 42:48.416
-No, you're the worst!
-[bells jingle]

42:48.500 --> 42:50.250
-[gasps]
-Santa!

42:50.333 --> 42:51.875
It's Santa Cl-- [groans]

42:51.958 --> 42:55.458
Fighting over toys will get you
on the naughty list!

42:55.541 --> 42:58.625
-Ho ho ho!
-[roars]

42:59.500 --> 43:02.125
