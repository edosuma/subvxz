WEBVTT

00:24.691 --> 00:28.403
[laughing]

00:28.445 --> 00:30.030
- We don't have time
for this.

00:30.071 --> 00:32.032
You're hurt.
I get it.

00:32.073 --> 00:33.825
Now, there's a way
out of this.

00:33.867 --> 00:35.410
Okay?

00:35.452 --> 00:37.162
[laughing]

00:40.415 --> 00:43.168
[clicking]

00:43.209 --> 00:44.711
This never happened
to me before.

00:44.753 --> 00:46.755
Really.
Man.

00:48.840 --> 00:50.383
Oh, man.

00:52.594 --> 00:54.095
Damn it.

00:54.137 --> 00:56.222
You never get a second chance
to make a first impression.

00:56.264 --> 00:59.184
You know?
[engine starting]

00:59.225 --> 01:01.561
Hey!
Oh, no, no, no, no! No!

01:05.231 --> 01:06.524
This time it's loaded.

01:06.566 --> 01:08.068
Six bullets,
each with your name on it

01:08.109 --> 01:10.111
if you don't get out
of my car right now!

01:12.614 --> 01:14.616
That said,
I'm willing to negotiate.

01:14.657 --> 01:16.159
[engine sputtering]

01:16.201 --> 01:20.038
Oh, I guess Evelyn
doesn't like you very much.

01:20.080 --> 01:21.498
I'll make you a deal.

01:21.539 --> 01:23.750
You scooch over,
I'll get you out of this alive.

01:23.792 --> 01:24.793
But you better
think fast,

01:24.834 --> 01:27.128
'cause that ain't
no birthday clown.

01:31.675 --> 01:33.510
Okay, go!

01:35.637 --> 01:36.971
[horn honks]

01:37.013 --> 01:40.183
Oh, shit.

01:41.976 --> 01:46.064
Okay, L1, R1, up, down, left,
right, right, down, up.

01:46.106 --> 01:50.485
[engine revving]

01:50.527 --> 01:51.945
All right, Evelyn,
we have nine days

01:51.986 --> 01:53.238
to get away
from this clown,

01:53.279 --> 01:55.240
ditch this psychopathic
hitchhiker,

01:55.281 --> 01:57.701
and make it
to New Chicago.

01:57.742 --> 01:59.327
Hey, look!
You forgot your seatbelt.

01:59.369 --> 02:02.288
[brakes squealing]
Agh!

02:24.853 --> 02:26.604
- Here for the show?

02:26.646 --> 02:29.482
- I'm definitely here
for the show!

02:29.524 --> 02:31.359
[gunfire]

02:46.708 --> 02:48.668
Oh, shit!

02:48.710 --> 02:52.422
[laughing]

03:02.057 --> 03:04.017
- You're not
coming to my show?

03:04.059 --> 03:07.520
Well, then the show
is coming to you!

03:26.623 --> 03:26.873
**

03:30.210 --> 03:32.462
* Oh baby
I like it raw *

03:32.504 --> 03:34.589
* Yeah baby
I like it raw *

03:34.631 --> 03:36.007
* Oh baby
I like it raw *

03:36.049 --> 03:38.551
- Suppertime!

03:38.593 --> 03:43.306
- Stu, I love you,
but this is all your fault.

03:43.348 --> 03:44.516
- How was I
supposed to know

03:44.557 --> 03:45.725
the woods would be
crawling with butchers.

03:45.767 --> 03:47.519
- They're talking about
getting us exiled.

03:47.560 --> 03:49.479
You had to get caught
sleeping on duty!

03:49.521 --> 03:51.523
- Hey!
You were sleeping, too!

03:51.564 --> 03:53.400
- I wasn't the one snoring
like a goat in heat!

03:53.441 --> 03:54.567
- It's called sleep apnea.

03:54.609 --> 03:55.777
It's a real
medical condition.

03:55.819 --> 03:57.821
And it would be
a lot more manageable

03:57.862 --> 04:00.657
if you hadn't traded in
my CPAP machine for porno.

04:00.699 --> 04:02.492
- Well, excuse me for trying
to get you something dope

04:02.534 --> 04:03.618
for your birthday!

04:03.660 --> 04:04.786
- You know what's dope?

04:04.828 --> 04:06.996
A full eight hours
of sleep.

04:07.038 --> 04:08.081
Dreaming is dope!

04:08.123 --> 04:09.165
- [Butcher] Francis!
- [Francis] What?

04:09.207 --> 04:11.084
- Why did you season
both meat baths

04:11.126 --> 04:12.335
in teriyaki sauce?

04:12.377 --> 04:14.879
Francis, we talked about
diversifying flavors.

04:14.921 --> 04:16.381
- Fine! Um...

04:16.423 --> 04:18.383
Oh, I'll cover the thick one
in lemon pepper.

04:18.425 --> 04:21.094
- No, no!
[sputtering]

04:21.136 --> 04:23.430
Oh, god,
it's so tangy, dude!

04:23.471 --> 04:25.140
- I call dibs
on the man titties.

04:25.181 --> 04:26.474
[gunshots]

04:30.478 --> 04:32.439
- Holy cow!

04:34.149 --> 04:35.316
- Clear!

04:35.358 --> 04:37.027
[whimpering]

04:47.746 --> 04:49.330
- We don't usually find
the pigs alive

04:49.372 --> 04:53.752
before the luau.
You can cut 'em loose.

04:53.793 --> 04:55.295
Butchers!

04:55.337 --> 04:58.715
They'd rather eat the flesh
of their own kind than starve.

05:02.510 --> 05:04.971
You guys are guards?

05:05.013 --> 05:06.931
- We, uh, we used to be.

05:06.973 --> 05:08.892
Uh, Mike and I were...
- On a scouting mission

05:08.933 --> 05:10.894
from Seattle
looking for trading routes.

05:10.935 --> 05:12.771
Our car broke down
and the next thing you know

05:12.812 --> 05:14.689
we're getting grabbed
by these assholes.

05:17.025 --> 05:20.403
- We're always on the lookout
for upstanding citizens.

05:20.445 --> 05:21.821
I'll give you guys
a choice.

05:21.863 --> 05:23.740
You can try and make
your way back up north

05:23.782 --> 05:26.284
where it can be
pretty dicey,

05:26.326 --> 05:28.453
or if you can
take the grit,

05:28.495 --> 05:30.455
join us in bringing
law and order

05:30.497 --> 05:34.125
back to the Divided States
of America.

05:34.167 --> 05:36.044
What do you say?

05:41.174 --> 05:42.842
- Come on.

05:45.553 --> 05:48.139
- Sweet.
- All right.

05:48.181 --> 05:50.016
Welcome to the law, huh?

05:50.058 --> 05:51.518
[cheers and applause]
- [agent] Yeah!

05:51.559 --> 05:53.645
- [Agent Stone] You guys.
- [agent] Don't go dying on us.

05:55.814 --> 05:57.357
- [John Doe] I can't believe

05:57.399 --> 05:59.651
I already got
a flat tire.

05:59.693 --> 06:01.695
Way to go, John.
Way to go.

06:04.030 --> 06:05.824
Hey, silent
but not very deadly,

06:05.865 --> 06:07.575
you gonna come over here
and help me with this?

06:07.617 --> 06:08.827
Don't shush me!

06:08.868 --> 06:09.994
You come over here
and help me with the tire.

06:10.036 --> 06:13.498
[Sweet Tooth]
* Toyland Toyland *

06:13.540 --> 06:17.836
* Little girl
and boy land *

06:17.877 --> 06:20.005
- I'm gonna handle this shit.
Watch my back.

06:20.046 --> 06:21.464
Ahh!

06:21.506 --> 06:23.758
Ah, shit. Ahh!

06:23.800 --> 06:26.469
[Sweet Tooth]
* When you dwell within it *

06:26.511 --> 06:29.597
* You are ever
happy then *

06:32.392 --> 06:36.354
You can hide,

06:36.396 --> 06:38.857
but I have ways
to find you.

06:42.444 --> 06:45.822
Marco! Marco!

06:45.864 --> 06:47.490
- I'll be right back,
Evelyn.

06:47.532 --> 06:49.451
I'll get us outta here.

06:49.492 --> 06:51.786
- [Sweet Tooth] Marco!

06:53.955 --> 06:58.209
Damn!
That usually works.

06:58.251 --> 07:02.005
[electrical humming]

07:02.047 --> 07:03.423
[clangs]

07:03.465 --> 07:05.091
Huh?

07:06.217 --> 07:07.844
- Shh.

07:10.638 --> 07:11.306
[glass breaking]
Oh, shit.

07:11.348 --> 07:12.766
[jackpot ringing]

07:17.937 --> 07:19.898
- Marco.

07:28.198 --> 07:29.824
[growls]

07:35.538 --> 07:37.123
- [Sweet Tooth] Well, hi there!

07:37.165 --> 07:38.917
[laughing]

07:40.669 --> 07:42.379
Oh, that tickled.

07:42.420 --> 07:44.798
You know, my dad always
wanted to play catch,

07:44.839 --> 07:46.591
but he could never
catch a ball.

07:46.633 --> 07:48.551
He could catch
a bullet.

07:48.593 --> 07:50.637
[gunshot]

07:50.679 --> 07:52.639
Why are you scurrying away,
little squirrel?

07:52.681 --> 07:55.058
Looking for a nut?

07:57.936 --> 08:02.023
This is gonna be fun!
Machete!

08:02.065 --> 08:04.359
Huh, swung
a little wide there.

08:06.236 --> 08:09.197
Well, aren't we
a tall glass of water!

08:09.239 --> 08:12.117
Me, I'm more of
a Hawaiian punch!

08:12.158 --> 08:13.827
[groans]

08:13.868 --> 08:14.828
I'm guessing
you don't fight much

08:14.869 --> 08:16.371
outside of your car now,
do you?

08:16.413 --> 08:19.332
- Look, clown, I don't need
four wheels to kick your ass.

08:22.460 --> 08:24.337
[laughing]

08:24.379 --> 08:26.673
[growling]

08:26.715 --> 08:28.550
Any chance we could get this
back in the cars?

08:28.591 --> 08:30.260
[laughing]

08:33.263 --> 08:36.391
- How about a little
kill music?

08:36.433 --> 08:38.059
* Livin' la vida loca *

08:38.101 --> 08:40.437
* She had dumps like
a truck truck truck *

08:40.478 --> 08:42.230
* Thighs like
what what what *

08:42.272 --> 08:44.691
* Baby move your
butt butt butt *

08:44.733 --> 08:45.942
* I think
I'll sing it again *

08:45.984 --> 08:48.445
* She had dumps like
a truck truck truck *

08:48.486 --> 08:50.363
* Thighs like
what what what *

08:50.405 --> 08:52.365
* All night long *

08:52.407 --> 08:56.077
* Let me see that thong *

08:56.119 --> 08:57.537
* Likin' where
the beat go *

08:57.579 --> 08:58.413
* Da-da-da-da *

08:58.455 --> 08:59.247
* Baby let your bootie go *

08:59.289 --> 09:00.331
* Da-da-da-da *

09:00.373 --> 09:01.374
* Girl you wanna show *

09:01.416 --> 09:02.500
* Da-da-da-da *

09:02.542 --> 09:03.752
* That thong
thong thong thong thong *

09:03.793 --> 09:06.421
- Do you love
the silver-haired god?

09:06.463 --> 09:07.756
And don't lie to me.

09:07.797 --> 09:08.965
- Yeah, man.

09:09.007 --> 09:10.592
Look, I listened to
"Unleash the Dragon"

09:10.633 --> 09:12.218
so many times
the disc broke.

09:12.260 --> 09:13.386
I'm not a liar.

09:13.428 --> 09:15.388
- Well, you said you were
coming to my show

09:15.430 --> 09:16.723
and then you
shot at me!

09:16.765 --> 09:18.350
- It was
a misunderstanding.

09:18.391 --> 09:21.436
I been getting shot at
ever since I can remember.

09:21.478 --> 09:23.730
It's force of habit,
I guess.

09:23.772 --> 09:25.607
- Sounds like
you have trust issues.

09:25.648 --> 09:26.941
- Yeah,
you're not wrong.

09:26.983 --> 09:28.651
Nice pipes, dude,
I have to say.

09:28.693 --> 09:31.112
That high note, whoo!
It was perfect.

09:31.154 --> 09:33.448
- Oh, word?
- Yeah, can I go?

09:33.490 --> 09:34.783
I got somewhere to be.

09:34.824 --> 09:36.409
- I thought you said
you were coming to the show!

09:36.451 --> 09:39.496
- Of course, I am.

09:39.537 --> 09:42.415
Just can I leave
after the show?

09:46.211 --> 09:50.590
- Well, in that case,
tonight is opening night!

09:50.632 --> 09:52.801
[laughing]

09:54.636 --> 09:56.179
- How were your showers?

09:56.221 --> 09:57.889
- Aw, I don't know
the last time

09:57.931 --> 10:00.392
I felt hot water
that wasn't my own piss.

10:00.433 --> 10:01.643
Uh, sir.

10:01.685 --> 10:03.186
- Consider it
your recompense

10:03.228 --> 10:05.313
for upholding
law and order.

10:05.355 --> 10:11.069
Warm showers, warm blankets,
warm meals.

10:11.111 --> 10:14.197
- Oh.
- Aw, fuck, mashed potatoes?

10:14.239 --> 10:17.117
- [Mike] And goddamn,
look at all that gravy!

10:17.158 --> 10:19.911
I wonder how we can get
one of those punch cards.

10:19.953 --> 10:23.415
- Now, let's proceed
to your initiation.

10:27.168 --> 10:28.545
Right this way,
gentlemen.

10:30.839 --> 10:33.967
What you see down there
is our supply truck.

10:34.009 --> 10:35.802
It brings us
important provisions.

10:35.844 --> 10:38.972
As you can see,
it's broken down.

10:39.014 --> 10:40.890
That's why
it's not moving.

10:40.932 --> 10:45.186
What I need for you to do
is to protect that truck.

10:45.228 --> 10:46.604
- From what?

10:46.646 --> 10:48.481
- Seagulls.

10:55.613 --> 10:58.199
- [Sweet Tooth] Skittles?
- [John Doe] No, I'm good.

10:58.241 --> 11:01.202
[chomping]
- Pre-show jitters.

11:01.244 --> 11:03.913
Listen, I really appreciate
you coming along willingly.

11:03.955 --> 11:05.665
Normally I have to drag people
into the theater

11:05.707 --> 11:06.958
kicking and screaming.

11:07.000 --> 11:08.752
But word of advice,

11:08.793 --> 11:11.212
you won't like
what happens if you run.

11:13.548 --> 11:14.674
What? Oh, him?

11:14.716 --> 11:15.925
Nah, he was here
before.

11:15.967 --> 11:17.052
Hey, Donald.

11:17.093 --> 11:19.012
Don't worry,
he can't hear us.

11:19.054 --> 11:21.348
I love names.
I'm kind of a name guy.

11:21.389 --> 11:23.683
You know, the right one
can send a shudder

11:23.725 --> 11:24.851
down your spine.

11:24.893 --> 11:26.895
Wanna know
what I go by?

11:26.936 --> 11:28.730
- There's not a person
on the West Coast

11:28.772 --> 11:31.399
that hasn't heard
of Sweet Tooth.

11:31.441 --> 11:32.567
- See what I mean?

11:32.609 --> 11:36.154
I mean, you really
feel that in your bones!

11:36.196 --> 11:38.531
What's your name,
friend?

11:38.573 --> 11:40.950
- John Doe.

11:40.992 --> 11:42.744
- Nah, I'll give it
a seven.

11:42.786 --> 11:44.120
- Hey, I didn't
pick it.

11:44.162 --> 11:45.789
I don't know what name
I was born with

11:45.830 --> 11:49.167
or who I am really.

11:49.209 --> 11:51.753
- Oh, amnesia.
What's your brand?

11:51.795 --> 11:54.714
Post-traumatic,
transient, dissociative?

11:54.756 --> 11:55.799
- All I know
is my first memory

11:55.840 --> 11:57.801
is me waking up
in my car

11:57.842 --> 11:59.302
with blood coming
out of my head.

11:59.344 --> 12:00.887
- Wait, that's
my first memory too!

12:00.929 --> 12:03.139
My head
covered in blood.

12:03.181 --> 12:04.307
Of course,
it was being pushed

12:04.349 --> 12:05.725
out of my mom's
whisker biscuit, but...

12:05.767 --> 12:06.893
- Whoa!
You remember that?

12:06.935 --> 12:10.397
- Oh, yeah.
I remember everything.

12:10.438 --> 12:12.190
You should consider
yourself lucky.

12:12.232 --> 12:14.734
There are some things
I wish I could forget.

12:14.776 --> 12:17.529
Like the time
I shit my pants

12:17.570 --> 12:20.490
in my elementary school
production of "Oklahoma".

12:20.532 --> 12:24.160
I can still see
the audience's faces

12:24.202 --> 12:26.705
laughing,
mocking.

12:29.416 --> 12:31.501
Did you know Sisqo's
real name was Mark?

12:37.924 --> 12:39.718
[grunting]

12:41.011 --> 12:42.637
- [Stu] Oh, a rock.

12:44.973 --> 12:46.516
- Man, what is
wrong with you?

12:46.558 --> 12:48.601
You holding in a fart
or something?

12:48.643 --> 12:51.271
- If the truck is so important,
why don't they just move it?

12:51.312 --> 12:53.440
Something doesn't
smell right, man.

12:53.481 --> 12:55.608
- Smells good to me.

12:55.650 --> 12:57.569
Back in Seattle,
they treated us like morons.

12:57.610 --> 13:00.405
Now look at us;
we holding .30-cals, dude!

13:00.447 --> 13:03.033
Come on, baby,
get your head in the game.

13:03.074 --> 13:05.785
Come on. Come on.

13:05.827 --> 13:07.620
There you go.
- Fuck you!

13:07.662 --> 13:09.456
- Eyes up, boys.

13:11.291 --> 13:12.959
Those seagulls lay a fingernail
on our supplies,

13:13.001 --> 13:15.503
it's open season.

13:15.545 --> 13:16.921
- What the hell?

13:16.963 --> 13:18.965
Hey, why do you
call 'em seagulls?

13:19.007 --> 13:20.675
These look like
normal survivors to me.

13:20.717 --> 13:23.636
- What else would you call
a bunch of fucking trash eaters?

13:33.605 --> 13:36.232
- Dude, are we really
gonna kill these guys?

13:36.274 --> 13:39.903
[suppressed gunshot]

13:39.944 --> 13:41.488
- There's one left, Stu.

13:41.529 --> 13:43.323
He's all yours.

13:52.999 --> 13:56.378
Clean it up!

14:04.552 --> 14:06.137
[suppressed gunshot]

14:06.179 --> 14:09.683
[laughter]
Melon down.

14:09.724 --> 14:11.184
- I saved your ass.

14:11.226 --> 14:13.853
- [Agent Stone] Seagulls,
butchers, exiles.

14:13.895 --> 14:17.190
They see the world
in shades of gray.

14:17.232 --> 14:19.859
What I need
from you two lawmen

14:19.901 --> 14:21.069
is to just show them

14:21.111 --> 14:23.697
that there's only two colors
in the world,

14:23.738 --> 14:27.283
black and blue.

14:27.325 --> 14:31.246
Now, you missed, Stu.
It can happen to anyone.

14:31.287 --> 14:33.790
Rookie mistake.

14:33.832 --> 14:36.835
Hey, don't let it
happen again.

14:39.587 --> 14:41.464
Okay.

14:41.506 --> 14:44.342
You guys want
some burgers?

14:44.384 --> 14:46.428
- Bubby-baby,
bubby-baby.

14:46.469 --> 14:48.138
Tip of the teat,
tip of the teat.

14:48.179 --> 14:49.597
Tip of the teat.

14:49.639 --> 14:54.144
My marvelous mutterer
makes me mingy on Monday.

14:54.185 --> 14:56.271
- You sleep here?

14:56.312 --> 14:58.064
What, the penthouse
was booked up?

14:58.106 --> 14:59.983
- Nah, way too much
space up there.

15:00.025 --> 15:01.192
Nice bidet, though.

15:01.234 --> 15:03.445
Like taking a shotgun
up the ass.

15:03.486 --> 15:05.947
No, I sleep here
because it reminds me

15:05.989 --> 15:08.366
of where I was
before Vegas.

15:08.408 --> 15:11.327
Back then, I lived with
a real solid group of dudes.

15:11.369 --> 15:14.998
But then the world took a shit
and I came to Sin City.

15:15.040 --> 15:18.460
Now that was a party.

15:18.501 --> 15:21.087
- You've been here alone
for over two decades?

15:21.129 --> 15:24.007
- Oh, shit, has it been
that long?

15:24.049 --> 15:25.258
Look at this guy.

15:25.300 --> 15:27.886
Hasn't aged a day.
What a beauty.

15:27.927 --> 15:29.262
Nah, I'm not alone.

15:29.304 --> 15:31.264
I got Harold,
which, have you--

15:31.306 --> 15:32.932
you haven't met
Harold yet.

15:32.974 --> 15:35.769
I'm gonna introduce you.

15:35.810 --> 15:38.396
This is Harold.

15:38.438 --> 15:40.607
Been my best friend
since I was a kid.

15:40.648 --> 15:42.901
You know, my entire life
people have been lying to me.

15:42.942 --> 15:45.362
Even my fucking parents!

15:45.403 --> 15:47.405
But, uh, never Harold.

15:47.447 --> 15:50.950
No, he can't lie to me.
He can't lie to anyone.

15:50.992 --> 15:52.535
- I can see that.

15:52.577 --> 15:53.661
[sighing]

15:53.703 --> 15:55.622
- I don't know what I'd do
without him.

15:55.663 --> 15:57.665
Look at that smile.

15:57.707 --> 15:59.376
So, you got a Harold?

15:59.417 --> 16:01.628
- No.
I got an Evelyn.

16:01.670 --> 16:03.296
- Oh, that's cute.

16:03.338 --> 16:07.467
- Before I met her,
being alone was all I knew.

16:07.509 --> 16:09.969
You know, she makes
everything easier, you know?

16:10.011 --> 16:13.640
Sometimes I wish I could
make her laugh. Right?

16:13.682 --> 16:15.308
I have to say
after all this time

16:15.350 --> 16:17.894
that's the sound
I miss the most.

16:17.936 --> 16:20.146
- [Sweet Tooth] You know
what sound I miss the most?

16:20.188 --> 16:23.149
The sound of hand meat
clapping together.

16:23.191 --> 16:25.568
Nothing like that
glorious applause.

16:25.610 --> 16:27.362
I mean, it's almost better
than, I don't know,

16:27.404 --> 16:29.406
hearing somebody choking
on their own blood.

16:29.447 --> 16:31.241
But look at me
getting carried away.

16:31.282 --> 16:33.535
Good thing that your Evelyn's
got hands, huh?

16:33.576 --> 16:35.495
She must clap for you
all the time.

16:35.537 --> 16:37.831
- Nah, she doesn't.
She's my car.

16:37.872 --> 16:39.290
- You talk to your car?

16:39.332 --> 16:42.836
That's weird, man.

16:42.877 --> 16:47.173
Ah, mwah!
There you are.

16:47.215 --> 16:51.261
So, if Evelyn's not the girl,
who's she?

16:53.972 --> 16:56.558
I caught this little pest
crawling through my vents.

16:56.599 --> 16:58.435
See, I was gonna
starve her.

16:58.476 --> 17:00.437
Watching the life slowly
drain from their eyes.

17:00.478 --> 17:02.814
Kind of
my artistic process.

17:02.856 --> 17:04.524
[laughing]

17:04.566 --> 17:08.278
You know, the last guy
lasted almost four weeks.

17:08.319 --> 17:09.821
Hey, Wilbur!

17:09.863 --> 17:12.157
I think she's gonna give you
a run for you money.

17:12.198 --> 17:13.616
She won't.

17:15.577 --> 17:17.370
Bubby-baby, bubby-baby.

17:17.412 --> 17:19.914
- Hey, you tried to kill me
every chance you get.

17:19.956 --> 17:21.666
Why should I
show you mercy?

17:25.003 --> 17:26.713
Goddamn it!

17:30.258 --> 17:32.886
Hey, man,
why don't you let her out?

17:32.927 --> 17:35.388
- And why would I do that?
- No, no, no, listen.

17:35.430 --> 17:37.349
What good
is an audience of one?

17:37.390 --> 17:39.100
Think about
all the meat slapping

17:39.142 --> 17:42.729
you'll hear
with four hands.

17:42.771 --> 17:44.898
- Ah, that's true.

17:44.939 --> 17:46.358
I don't often
get feedback

17:46.399 --> 17:50.111
from the 18 to 35
female demographic.

17:50.153 --> 17:53.365
Fine!
[sighs]

17:53.406 --> 17:55.575
You fish her out
and take a seat.

17:55.617 --> 18:00.163
Don't worry,
I got a table just for you.

18:00.205 --> 18:02.332
- And what happens
after the show?

18:02.374 --> 18:04.876
- Well, you go on
your merry way.

18:04.918 --> 18:06.503
- Really?

18:06.544 --> 18:07.754
- Well,
if I'm being honest,

18:07.796 --> 18:10.882
nobody has survived
all three acts.

18:10.924 --> 18:12.592
Gird your loins!

18:24.479 --> 18:25.313
- Tonight,
you will be enjoying

18:26.272 --> 18:27.774
white tiger
prepared three ways.

18:27.816 --> 18:30.068
There's a whole pack of those
milky white assholes

18:30.110 --> 18:31.945
breeding up on
the fourth floor.

18:31.986 --> 18:33.905
Anyway, enjoy.

18:33.947 --> 18:35.532
Bony tit!

18:39.411 --> 18:40.704
- Give me back those keys!
Hey, hey!

18:40.745 --> 18:41.871
If it wasn't for me,

18:41.913 --> 18:43.873
you would be
a starving corpse right now.

18:54.426 --> 18:57.929
Listen, neither one of us
made it pretty far on our own.

18:57.971 --> 19:02.058
So, instead of us trying to--
holy shit, this steak is good.

19:02.100 --> 19:03.768
Instead of us trying to stab
each other in the back,

19:03.810 --> 19:05.478
we should put our heads
together and figure out

19:05.520 --> 19:07.355
how in the hell we're going
to make it through the show.

19:09.691 --> 19:11.651
Is any of this
getting through to you?

19:15.989 --> 19:18.742
Blink twice for yes.

19:20.326 --> 19:22.871
Cool, we're fucked.

19:22.912 --> 19:23.955
[clapping]

19:26.166 --> 19:27.375
[clears throat]

19:30.920 --> 19:34.424
- Tonight, I will be presenting
a one-man play entitled

19:34.466 --> 19:37.552
"That's In-Room
Entertainment",

19:37.594 --> 19:40.305
based on the hotel's
in-room entertainment.

19:42.140 --> 19:46.436
**

19:46.478 --> 19:48.980
Hi, I'm Debra
from guest services.

19:49.022 --> 19:51.316
And welcome to Nevada!

19:51.358 --> 19:55.236
Deep in the heart of Vegas
is the Monte Cristo,

19:55.278 --> 19:57.739
a veritable oasis
in the sand.

20:01.743 --> 20:04.454
And don't forget
about our promenade.

20:04.496 --> 20:06.498
It features
all the latest brands

20:06.539 --> 20:09.793
and is just a stone's throw
from the salon.

20:09.834 --> 20:13.004
Girl, might be time to take care
of those split ends!

20:19.177 --> 20:21.554
And for all you
lovebirds out there,

20:21.596 --> 20:26.309
Las Vegas is still the marriage
capital of the world.

20:26.351 --> 20:28.728
Time for kisses!

20:30.855 --> 20:36.736
And you have selected
express checkout.

20:36.778 --> 20:39.864
Please leave your key
at the drop box

20:39.906 --> 20:42.701
at the front desk.

20:42.742 --> 20:46.037
And thank you
for staying with us.

20:54.587 --> 20:57.340
Well, we've come
to the Q&A

20:57.382 --> 21:00.343
where I ask the Q's
or I kick your A.

21:00.385 --> 21:03.304
So, now is
the moment of truth.

21:03.346 --> 21:05.056
What do you think?

21:07.475 --> 21:12.856
- Oh, um, I loved it.

21:12.897 --> 21:15.316
- Liar!

21:15.358 --> 21:17.902
What exactly
did you love about it?

21:17.944 --> 21:19.654
- Uh, your performance!
I was moved!

21:23.491 --> 21:25.952
What? It was
a tour de force!

21:25.994 --> 21:29.372
- I am gonna tour de force
this machete down your throat!

21:29.414 --> 21:31.583
If you're not gonna
tell the truth,

21:31.624 --> 21:34.252
then I'm gonna make you
shut up and bleed.

21:34.294 --> 21:37.047
- It was a fucking
snooze-fest.

21:37.088 --> 21:39.090
- Now you talk?

21:39.132 --> 21:40.133
- What the hell
did you say?

21:40.175 --> 21:42.260
- It sucked.

21:42.302 --> 21:43.928
Your performance was
dull as dick water

21:43.970 --> 21:46.431
and frankly beneath you.

21:46.473 --> 21:48.224
- And you?

21:48.266 --> 21:49.976
You agree with her?

21:56.775 --> 21:59.652
- Yes.
I agree with her.

22:02.405 --> 22:03.948
Come on, man,
it was boring.

22:03.990 --> 22:04.949
I get it,
you've been here forever,

22:04.991 --> 22:06.785
but you did a play
about a hotel!

22:10.997 --> 22:13.416
- But didn't Mark Twain say
you should write what you know?

22:13.458 --> 22:14.709
- Well, Mark Twain's
a dumbass.

22:14.751 --> 22:16.086
You gotta get out
in the world, man.

22:16.127 --> 22:17.504
- Yeah.
Look, trust me,

22:17.545 --> 22:20.382
you don't want to spend
the rest of your life alone.

22:20.423 --> 22:21.966
You end up
talking to a car.

22:22.008 --> 22:23.593
- Yeah, like this guy.

22:23.635 --> 22:25.261
- You know what?
You're right.

22:25.303 --> 22:27.013
I can't wait here
for my audience.

22:27.055 --> 22:30.892
I need to get out there
and hunt my audience down.

22:30.934 --> 22:31.976
- Oh, no, no,
that's not what I meant.

22:32.018 --> 22:33.937
- No, that's exactly
what you meant.

22:33.978 --> 22:36.940
I'm gonna get out there,
and I'm gonna embrace the chaos.

22:36.981 --> 22:41.403
Who knows,
maybe I'll even fall in love!

22:41.444 --> 22:44.030
The show is going
on the road!

22:44.072 --> 22:53.790
**

22:53.832 --> 22:56.084
- That was
beautiful, man!

22:56.126 --> 23:04.092
**

23:17.522 --> 23:19.816
- Well, a night
of firsts.

23:19.858 --> 23:21.067
My first
honest critique,

23:21.109 --> 23:23.778
first people I ever let
leave here alive,

23:23.820 --> 23:27.824
but most importantly,
my first two fans.

23:27.866 --> 23:29.576
You two.

23:29.617 --> 23:31.911
I got you a headshot.

23:31.953 --> 23:33.788
There's an inscription
in that.

23:33.830 --> 23:36.666
- [John Doe] "See you soon."
- I hope not.

23:36.708 --> 23:39.252
- Hey, thanks
for being honest.

23:43.465 --> 23:45.800
[engine revving
and tires squealing]

23:45.842 --> 24:00.273
**

24:00.315 --> 24:03.485
[gunshots]

24:03.526 --> 24:05.320
* Come on *

24:05.362 --> 24:07.447
* Come on *

24:07.489 --> 24:09.616

* Yeah *

24:14.913 --> 24:17.582

That thong *

24:17.624 --> 24:21.336

Said I like the way *

* I don't think
you heard me *

24:33.473 --> 24:37.268
* Oh-oh-oh *

24:39.604 --> 24:41.731
* Baby *

24:41.773 --> 24:45.402
* Oh-oh-oh *

24:45.443 --> 24:49.072
* Yeah *

24:49.114 --> 24:52.200
* All right *

24:52.242 --> 24:53.576
- [John Doe] You know, I have
to admit I didn't think

24:53.618 --> 24:56.454
we were gonna make it
out of there alive.

24:56.496 --> 24:57.789
I mean, it would have been
a lot easier

24:57.831 --> 24:59.457
if you had piped up
instead of just trying to--

24:59.499 --> 25:01.042
oh, come on!
Have you learned nothing?

25:04.796 --> 25:06.297
What is your problem
anyway?

25:06.339 --> 25:07.424
- I'm trying
to find someone.

25:07.465 --> 25:08.383
- Well, I'm trying
to get somewhere,

25:08.425 --> 25:09.342
and I lost a hell
of a lot of time

25:09.384 --> 25:11.136
watching that
god-awful play.

25:13.179 --> 25:15.348
If you put the gun down,
I'll drop you off

25:15.390 --> 25:17.600
as close as I can
to where you're going. Deal?

25:17.642 --> 25:19.978
- Fine.
But I'm keeping the gun.

25:20.020 --> 25:22.355
- No, come on, that one's new.
All right, all right, take it.

25:27.861 --> 25:29.696
What's your name anyway?

25:32.532 --> 25:34.284
Okay, I'll start.
Hi, I'm John.

25:34.325 --> 25:36.453
You're...?

25:36.494 --> 25:38.538
Bridget?

25:38.580 --> 25:40.040
Yolanda?
Jennifer?

25:41.708 --> 25:43.752
Okay. So, since you
like to be quiet,

25:43.793 --> 25:45.462
that's what I'm gonna
call you: Quiet.

25:45.503 --> 25:48.131
Is that okay, Quiet?
- Yep.

25:48.173 --> 25:49.966
- So, you're really not
gonna tell me your name?

25:50.008 --> 25:51.676
- Nope.

25:52.635 --> 25:54.304
- Fine.

25:54.346 --> 25:55.889
Makes it easier
when I drop your ass off

25:55.930 --> 25:58.433
in the middle
of nowhere, Quiet.

26:05.065 --> 26:06.483
- [Agent Shepard]
Sack up, newbs.

26:06.524 --> 26:09.194
Got a live one.

26:09.235 --> 26:10.987
I'll stop the vehicle

26:11.029 --> 26:13.073
and demand to see
their open road license.

26:13.114 --> 26:15.075
If they don't got it,
they don't pass.

26:19.412 --> 26:20.372
What?

26:20.413 --> 26:22.499
- Hey, sorry,
just one question.

26:22.540 --> 26:24.876
Where do we bring 'em?

26:24.918 --> 26:28.755
Oh, and why are we
stopping them?

26:28.797 --> 26:31.508
And what's
an open road license?

26:31.549 --> 26:33.843
Is it common at the--
- Just get in.

26:33.885 --> 26:36.054
- We learn on the job.
I respect that.

26:36.888 --> 26:37.889
- I've never seen
a checkpoint

26:37.931 --> 26:39.891
that wasn't outside
of a settlement.

26:39.933 --> 26:41.101
And these guys
aren't on the map.

26:41.142 --> 26:43.895
So, more delays.

26:43.937 --> 26:44.979
Let me do
all the talking.

26:45.021 --> 26:46.356
I deal with these guys
all the time.

26:46.398 --> 26:49.192
I speak their lingo.

26:49.234 --> 26:51.986
- Hey, ORL, please.

26:52.028 --> 26:54.406
- Did you just ask me
for oral?

26:54.447 --> 26:58.243
- Uh, no, sir.
ORL.

26:58.284 --> 26:59.911
Open road license.

26:59.953 --> 27:02.539
- That's an awful acronym.

27:02.580 --> 27:04.541
Hey, look,
I'm just a milkman.

27:04.582 --> 27:07.168
I'm just passing through, man.
Come on.

27:07.210 --> 27:08.795
And you guys look great,
by the way.

27:08.837 --> 27:10.130
I love your shirts, man.

27:10.171 --> 27:11.965
What are you, like a club
or a team or something?

27:12.007 --> 27:14.718
- We're officers.
Of the law.

27:14.759 --> 27:17.262
- Ah, angry black friend.
Okay.

27:26.688 --> 27:29.065
Hey, where--
Get back in the car!

27:29.107 --> 27:30.442
- [Stu] Listen to
your friend!

27:30.483 --> 27:31.818
- Eat my ass,
motherfucker!

27:31.860 --> 27:35.780
[clicking and buzzing]

27:35.822 --> 27:38.074
[wincing]

27:38.116 --> 27:44.456
