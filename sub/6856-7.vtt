00:17.535 --> 00:18.895
<i>Missing in action!</i>

00:19.534 --> 00:24.174
<i>Anakin Skywalker's heroic droid navigator
R2-D2 was lost in battle.</i>

00:24.494 --> 00:26.861
<i>When a desperate search fails
to locate R2,</i>

00:26.894 --> 00:30.893
<i>Anakin is forced to take on
a new navigator, R3-S6.</i>

00:31.213 --> 00:33.773
<i>Now the Jedi embark
on a dangerous new mission...</i>

00:33.813 --> 00:35.814
<i>to find a secret enemy listening post.</i>

00:36.533 --> 00:41.052
<i>Meanwhile, R2-D2 has fallen
into the hands of a vile droid smuggler</i>

00:41.086 --> 00:43.572
<i>and is on his way
to General Grievous...</i>

00:43.613 --> 00:47.252
<i>who will surely plunder
the Republic's secrets hidden within him.</i>

00:53.092 --> 00:55.451
I am entering your orbit now, General.

00:56.051 --> 00:57.851
I will be at your station shortly.

00:58.091 --> 00:59.451
And, General...

00:59.611 --> 01:01.531
<i>What is it, Gha Nachkt?</i>

01:01.610 --> 01:04.891
I prefer to get my reward in cash.

01:13.650 --> 01:15.290
We've searched their supply grids, sir.

01:15.450 --> 01:18.169
There's nothing to indicate
the presence of an enemy outpost.

01:35.328 --> 01:36.008
Huh?

01:39.087 --> 01:42.527
Master, I'm receiving
a strange transmission.

01:42.560 --> 01:43.967
I can't seem to make it out, though.

01:45.846 --> 01:46.966
Boost the volume, Goldie.

01:49.166 --> 01:50.646
No, you're losing it.

01:54.646 --> 01:55.405
That's R2.

01:55.486 --> 01:58.005
Uh, that doesn't sound like R2.

01:58.038 --> 01:58.651
It's him.

01:58.685 --> 02:00.285
I could never forget that voice.

02:00.319 --> 02:01.245
Trace it, Rex.

02:01.325 --> 02:02.205
Sir.

02:02.365 --> 02:04.324
What is going on here?

02:08.564 --> 02:10.764
You sneaky little scrap pile.

02:14.004 --> 02:16.044
You'd better be worth all this trouble.

02:20.163 --> 02:23.123
Master, our orders were
to find the Separatist listening post.

02:23.163 --> 02:25.442
Perhaps R2 is at the listening post.

02:25.682 --> 02:26.682
Did you consider that?

02:28.003 --> 02:29.722
We have a lock on the droid's location, sir.

02:29.962 --> 02:31.441
Prepare to jump to those coordinates.

02:31.562 --> 02:32.202
Yes, sir.

02:35.242 --> 02:36.681
Hold on, R2, old buddy.

02:36.762 --> 02:37.722
We're coming.

02:47.201 --> 02:49.121
<i>What is it, Gha Nachkt?</i>

02:49.154 --> 02:50.127
I've arrived.

02:50.160 --> 02:51.520
Could you lower your shields?

03:04.959 --> 03:06.718
Keep moving, grease spot.

03:12.718 --> 03:13.798
Aah.

03:14.517 --> 03:18.277
This is the droid
those Jedi came looking for, General.

03:18.478 --> 03:22.357
What secrets do you carry, my little friend?

03:24.197 --> 03:25.957
So defiant.

03:26.036 --> 03:27.723
No need for fear.

03:27.757 --> 03:29.956
We're all droids here.

03:31.036 --> 03:32.963
Rip this little rat apart,

03:32.996 --> 03:34.916
and find out everything he knows.

03:38.036 --> 03:39.436
Right away, General.

03:51.154 --> 03:54.434
Sir, the last transmission came from
that moon's upper atmosphere,

03:54.467 --> 03:55.434
directly ahead.

03:57.313 --> 03:59.034
That's a Separatist battle sphere.

03:59.393 --> 04:01.313
I'm picking up a lot of encrypted chatter.

04:01.833 --> 04:02.793
Contact Obi-Wan.

04:02.953 --> 04:06.393
Stubby, scramble secret code set 1477.

04:07.153 --> 04:09.073
I don't want that station to pick this up.

04:12.513 --> 04:13.193
<i>Anakin?</i>

04:13.392 --> 04:16.272
Master, I believe we've found
your Separatist listening post.

04:16.471 --> 04:17.438
<i>Excellent work.</i>

04:17.471 --> 04:18.558
<i>Back off and wait.</i>

04:18.591 --> 04:21.112
<i>I'll send two mainline cruisers
to help you destroy it.</i>

04:21.152 --> 04:21.952
But R2...

04:22.191 --> 04:24.431
We believe my droid, R2, is on board.

04:24.465 --> 04:25.671
He's the one that led us here.

04:26.071 --> 04:29.071
<i>Hmm, this complicates things.</i>

04:29.111 --> 04:31.790
<i>You must sneak aboard that station
and destroy it</i>

04:31.824 --> 04:33.750
<i>before they crack R2's memory banks.</i>

04:33.950 --> 04:35.750
<i>I know you're fond of that droid,</i>

04:35.783 --> 04:37.550
<i>but he's fallen into enemy hands.</i>

04:37.670 --> 04:39.829
I could rescue R2.

04:40.150 --> 04:42.629
<i>No, this is not a rescue mission.</i>

04:43.869 --> 04:45.269
Keep jamming their scanners.

04:45.349 --> 04:47.149
If they spot us, we're dead.

04:57.588 --> 04:58.708
We're bringing the droid?

04:58.948 --> 05:02.907
We'll need Goldie to open secured hatches
and access the station's computer for us.

05:03.067 --> 05:06.027
Oh, and, Rex...
you get to carry him.

05:09.306 --> 05:10.706
Ah, that's just great.

05:22.625 --> 05:24.185
Follow me, boys!

05:47.903 --> 05:50.783
Take this upstairs,
and be sure not to drop it.

05:50.816 --> 05:52.262
Whoa!
Ow.

05:54.582 --> 05:57.822
Those 631s are not
the brightest lights on the ship.

06:06.221 --> 06:08.781
Next time, you're lugging
this astromech around.

06:19.980 --> 06:22.940
All this moisture is corroding
my servo-motors.

06:23.099 --> 06:24.279
Go up to level eight.

06:24.312 --> 06:25.459
Get your head adjusted.

06:25.493 --> 06:26.579
It feels great.

06:26.620 --> 06:27.819
That'll feel gr-

06:28.779 --> 06:29.419
What the...?

06:36.499 --> 06:37.899
All right, Stubby.
Get to work.

06:41.538 --> 06:42.538
We are here.

06:42.778 --> 06:45.777
The reactors are 30 levels below us, there.

06:46.177 --> 06:48.937
Ahsoka, you take the squad
and blow up those reactors.

06:48.971 --> 06:50.097
Gravity will do the rest.

06:50.177 --> 06:51.337
We'll meet in the landing bay.

06:51.657 --> 06:52.657
Where are you going?

06:53.097 --> 06:55.177
I'm just going to
have a little look around.

06:55.336 --> 06:57.696
I hope you find R2 in one piece.

07:05.176 --> 07:07.056
This is...
This is...!

07:07.455 --> 07:08.415
General Grievous!

07:09.135 --> 07:10.495
What is it?

07:10.655 --> 07:14.375
It appears this droid's mission memory
has never been erased.

07:14.615 --> 07:19.134
It contains every Republic formation
and strategy they have.

07:20.614 --> 07:21.660
Good work.

07:21.694 --> 07:24.654
You certainly earned your fee this time.

07:24.934 --> 07:26.620
More than my fee.

07:26.654 --> 07:29.973
This droid is worth more,
I get paid more.

07:30.007 --> 07:31.293
Now, I suggest-

07:35.013 --> 07:36.733
There is your bonus.

07:47.932 --> 07:50.211
Report, agent R3.

07:52.051 --> 07:53.531
The Jedi are here?

07:53.771 --> 07:55.651
<i>Delay them until I arrive.</i>

07:57.171 --> 07:58.931
Goldie, where are you?

08:01.170 --> 08:02.570
Sound the alarm.

08:04.650 --> 08:05.969
What are you doing back here?

08:06.170 --> 08:07.170
Come on.

08:11.010 --> 08:14.769
Now we will transfer all your secrets to me.

08:16.049 --> 08:19.769
Don't worry.
I won't let anything happen to you.

08:25.128 --> 08:27.767
Republic troops have infiltrated the base.

08:27.801 --> 08:29.687
Keep this droid secure.

08:31.008 --> 08:33.967
I will deal with the Jedi myself.

08:42.446 --> 08:43.806
We found the reactor room, sir.

08:44.222 --> 08:46.007
<i>The alarm triggered
another security door...</i>

08:46.488 --> 08:47.639
...ray-shielded.

08:47.966 --> 08:50.046
This could take a while to bypass.

08:50.079 --> 08:51.062
Good luck with that.

08:51.096 --> 08:52.150
Go ahead, Goldie.

08:52.184 --> 08:53.205
Make me proud.

08:56.045 --> 08:57.205
Oh, this'll be good.

09:03.125 --> 09:04.564
Those droids are getting close, sir.

09:05.044 --> 09:07.403
Do you think R3's going to
open up that door any time soon?

09:07.724 --> 09:09.043
He's working on it.

09:09.077 --> 09:10.364
Patience, Captain.

09:13.363 --> 09:14.923
I can always hot-wire it, sir.

09:15.204 --> 09:16.363
Hurry up, Goldie.

09:18.163 --> 09:19.523
I think we've run out of time.

09:19.683 --> 09:20.602
Blast 'em!

09:43.600 --> 09:45.720
Rex, droid poppers, now!

09:45.840 --> 09:47.040
Droid poppers!

10:11.638 --> 10:14.357
<i>Take the captured R2 unit to my ship.</i>

10:20.717 --> 10:23.716
They sent a child to destroy my station?

10:24.277 --> 10:26.636
The Republic must be running out of Jedi.

10:27.477 --> 10:29.556
You must be General Grievous.

10:32.116 --> 10:33.876
He's just another tinny, boys.

10:34.275 --> 10:36.236
Let's scrap him like the rest.

10:55.473 --> 10:57.473
Sorry to interrupt your playtime, grumpy,

10:57.633 --> 10:59.393
but wouldn't you prefer a challenge?

10:59.553 --> 11:01.273
That wouldn't be you.

11:22.711 --> 11:24.751
All units, stay on high alert.

11:24.990 --> 11:28.270
Watch out for a second Jedi
loose in the station.

11:36.150 --> 11:36.909
R2!

11:41.109 --> 11:42.229
Hang on, R2!

11:50.108 --> 11:53.028
Where is the fight
you promised me, youngling?

12:03.267 --> 12:04.866
Ahsoka, it's me, Rex.

12:05.026 --> 12:06.206
There are only two of us left.

12:06.239 --> 12:07.386
Should we abort the mission?

12:07.547 --> 12:09.146
No, complete the mission.

12:09.266 --> 12:11.546
Set the charges
and rendezvous at the landing bay.

12:11.706 --> 12:12.346
<i>But, sir...</i>

12:12.506 --> 12:13.826
That's an order, Rex.

12:13.946 --> 12:15.106
I'll keep the general busy.

12:15.146 --> 12:16.466
Ahsoka out.

12:17.105 --> 12:18.271
She's distracting Grievous.

12:18.305 --> 12:20.385
Come on.
We still got a job to do.

12:21.945 --> 12:23.545
Come here, child.

12:23.665 --> 12:25.225
I'm looking for you.

12:25.705 --> 12:28.384
So far, you have failed to impress me.

12:29.424 --> 12:30.944
Goldie, over here.

12:32.744 --> 12:33.784
Goldie, no!

12:35.024 --> 12:36.944
<i>Ahsoka, we're in the reactor-</i>

12:38.943 --> 12:40.663
Your friends won't help you.

12:40.784 --> 12:42.304
You're stuck with me.

12:55.662 --> 12:57.261
You have something that belongs to me.

13:35.818 --> 13:36.818
Thanks, R2.

13:38.297 --> 13:39.777
It's great to see you too, buddy.

13:39.937 --> 13:41.457
You don't look so good.
You okay?

13:46.857 --> 13:48.537
Rex?
Rex, can you hear me?

13:48.657 --> 13:50.577
R3? R3, is that you?

13:51.016 --> 13:51.856
I've got R2.

13:52.256 --> 13:53.696
I'll meet you back at the landing bay.

13:56.776 --> 13:57.360
R3?

13:57.456 --> 13:59.736
Uh, yeah,
I had to get a replacement droid.

13:59.856 --> 14:01.136
Look, sorry, R2.

14:02.295 --> 14:03.616
It was Obi-Wan's idea.

14:03.736 --> 14:05.695
Look, we'll talk about this later.

14:05.815 --> 14:07.255
Twilight, this is Skywalker.

14:09.215 --> 14:11.975
<i>Rendezvous at the south landing bay
immediately for evacuation.</i>

14:12.054 --> 14:13.055
Acknowledged, General.

14:13.088 --> 14:14.374
I'm on my way.

14:18.774 --> 14:21.694
R3, what have you to report?

14:25.453 --> 14:27.893
That stubby little backstabber.

14:28.133 --> 14:31.253
So Skywalker has come
for his R2 unit.

14:32.772 --> 14:35.052
Go and make certain
they do not escape.

14:48.051 --> 14:49.491
Great, there's the Twilight.

14:49.531 --> 14:50.531
Now where's everyone else?

14:54.010 --> 14:54.690
Sir.

14:56.330 --> 14:58.170
Hey, Stubby, where's Ahsoka?

15:01.450 --> 15:02.410
General Skywalker.

15:02.649 --> 15:03.889
Explosives are in place, sir.

15:03.923 --> 15:04.969
Objective completed.

15:05.089 --> 15:06.249
Where is Ahsoka?

15:06.409 --> 15:07.810
She engaged General Grievous.

15:07.929 --> 15:08.809
Alone?

15:09.009 --> 15:11.209
She distracted him
while we completed the mission.

15:11.489 --> 15:12.768
It was on her orders, sir.

15:13.129 --> 15:14.129
The droid was with her.

15:14.209 --> 15:16.289
- We've got to find her.
- I can take you to her, sir.

15:24.447 --> 15:25.687
What is the matter with you?

15:25.768 --> 15:27.327
Are you trying to get us killed?

15:39.766 --> 15:42.525
I've got a bad feeling about this, sir.

15:43.645 --> 15:45.685
That double-crossing droid is a spy.

16:17.483 --> 16:20.682
Another lightsaber to add to my collection.

16:21.002 --> 16:22.962
My spy droid, R3,

16:23.082 --> 16:25.402
has trapped your precious master.

16:25.761 --> 16:28.961
When I'm finished with you,
he's next.

16:29.002 --> 16:30.041
You're wrong.

16:30.521 --> 16:31.681
He's gone by now,

16:31.721 --> 16:35.480
and he's going to blow up
your precious spy station.

16:35.961 --> 16:37.560
Not this time.

16:44.880 --> 16:46.840
Captain, trigger the explosives.

16:46.999 --> 16:49.199
But, sir,
we're still in the station.

16:49.280 --> 16:51.399
You just let me worry about the details.

16:51.559 --> 16:52.559
Sir, yes, sir.

17:19.477 --> 17:21.636
R2, I need you
to get the hangar door open.

17:22.715 --> 17:24.675
See if there are any controls
on the outer platform.

18:19.191 --> 18:20.710
So, what did I miss?

18:21.431 --> 18:22.710
Oh, the usual.

18:24.630 --> 18:27.190
It was foolish of you
to take on Grievous by yourself.

18:27.224 --> 18:29.716
Well, I was leading the mission,

18:29.749 --> 18:31.789
and it seemed like a good idea
at the time.

18:37.668 --> 18:40.789
Did he tell you your stubby
little gold droid pal works for him?

18:41.309 --> 18:43.028
He might have mentioned it.

18:43.228 --> 18:44.948
I guess we were all fooled.

18:48.108 --> 18:50.908
General Skywalker,
there are fuel cells over here.

18:51.107 --> 18:52.067
Get ready, Rex.

19:03.066 --> 19:04.787
- R2 did it.
- Of course he did it.

19:04.826 --> 19:06.026
Now let's get out of here.

19:08.986 --> 19:10.346
R2, where are you?

19:29.144 --> 19:30.903
General Skywalker has
gotten into his fighter.

19:30.937 --> 19:31.824
Where's he going?

19:32.024 --> 19:33.744
He's going after R2.

19:33.903 --> 19:36.183
I'll be right back.
Don't wait for me.

20:00.461 --> 20:01.421
Come on, R2.

20:18.979 --> 20:20.859
<i>So, let me get this straight, Anakin.</i>

20:21.099 --> 20:23.538
<i>You risked the mission,
all your men,</i>

20:23.698 --> 20:25.378
<i>even your padawan,</i>

20:25.539 --> 20:27.018
<i>to save a droid.</i>

20:28.338 --> 20:30.058
R2 found the listening post,

20:30.092 --> 20:31.464
and he saved our lives.

20:31.497 --> 20:33.417
We couldn't just leave him there,
Obi-Wan.

20:33.577 --> 20:36.138
<i>Oh, Anakin. One day...</i>

20:37.658 --> 20:39.657
I'm glad we got R2 back, Master.

20:39.697 --> 20:41.817
But Obi-Wan does have a point.

20:41.937 --> 20:44.097
Ahsoka, I knew you would
complete the mission.

20:44.256 --> 20:46.896
Besides,
R2 is more than a droid.

20:47.136 --> 20:48.176
He's a friend.

20:49.305 --> 20:55.253
