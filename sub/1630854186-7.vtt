WEBVTT

00:02.045 --> 00:03.003
Previously onYoung Sheldon...So I told my folks

00:03.046 --> 00:06.006
about the baby.

00:06.049 --> 00:07.268
And?

00:07.311 --> 00:08.182
They told me I'm on my own.

00:08.225 --> 00:09.487
They want nothing to do with me.

00:09.531 --> 00:12.447
Give it a minute.
They still might come around.

00:12.490 --> 00:15.058
I didn't even get to the part
where the father's 17 years old.

00:15.102 --> 00:17.191
Something fun for next time.

00:17.234 --> 00:19.584
Welcome to King Kong Comics.
I'm Missy.

00:19.628 --> 00:21.543
If you have any questions,
please let me know.

00:21.586 --> 00:22.935
I don't have any questions,

00:22.979 --> 00:24.415
I know more about comic books
than you do.

00:24.459 --> 00:25.895
Cool. If you need something,

00:25.938 --> 00:28.332
I'll be at the front counter...
where I work.

00:31.857 --> 00:32.815
MANDY:
This is nice.

00:32.858 --> 00:35.383
Yep. But it's not a date.

00:35.426 --> 00:37.080
Just dinner.
Right.

00:37.124 --> 00:39.474
For two people
having a baby.
Georgie...

00:39.517 --> 00:41.780
Who recently spent a night
of lovemaking together.

00:41.824 --> 00:43.173
Please stop.

00:43.217 --> 00:44.696
I just want to know
what we're doing here.

00:44.740 --> 00:46.046
We're having dinner,

00:46.089 --> 00:47.395
and I'm ordering
two desserts.

00:47.438 --> 00:50.093
Don't complicate it.

00:50.137 --> 00:51.138
Oh, no.

00:51.181 --> 00:52.139
What?

00:52.182 --> 00:54.228
My parents.

00:57.535 --> 00:58.928
Cool. Should we say hi?

00:58.971 --> 01:00.408
We should run.

01:01.800 --> 01:03.802
[quiet chatter]

01:08.459 --> 01:09.982
Oh, just stop it.

01:10.940 --> 01:13.812

01:13.856 --> 01:16.685

Hi, Mom.

01:32.353 --> 01:33.615
Dad.

01:33.658 --> 01:34.877
Amanda.

01:34.920 --> 01:36.008
Hey, sweetie.

01:36.052 --> 01:38.272
This is my, uh...

01:39.664 --> 01:40.448
This is Georgie.

01:40.491 --> 01:42.102
Hey, nice to meet y'all.

01:44.974 --> 01:46.802
Okay.

01:46.845 --> 01:49.152
So, this is the father?

01:49.196 --> 01:50.849
Mm-hmm.
Proud father.

01:50.893 --> 01:52.286
Very proud.

01:52.329 --> 01:53.809
How old are you?

01:53.852 --> 01:55.593
In March, I'll be...Georgie actually

01:55.637 --> 01:56.855
manages a laundromat.

01:56.899 --> 01:58.814
He's very successful.

01:58.857 --> 02:01.208
My dad runs
his own business, too.

02:01.251 --> 02:02.513
Really? What do you do?

02:02.557 --> 02:04.515
I own the tire shop
up over there on...

02:04.559 --> 02:05.864
How old are you?

02:05.908 --> 02:09.607
Well, old enough
to know better. [chuckles]

02:09.651 --> 02:11.392
Most important is, I'm here

02:11.435 --> 02:13.872
for Mandy and the baby
whether we're a couple or not.

02:14.612 --> 02:17.485
Wait, now hold on a second,
y'all ain't together?

02:18.660 --> 02:19.878
Good question.

02:19.922 --> 02:23.143
You are or you aren't?
Which is it?

02:23.186 --> 02:24.579
That's our business.

02:24.622 --> 02:27.538
Well... it is her life.

02:27.582 --> 02:29.236
The bill is paid.

02:29.279 --> 02:31.455
We're leaving.

02:33.762 --> 02:35.155
It was nice to meet you.

02:35.198 --> 02:36.460
Yeah, you too.

02:36.504 --> 02:38.723
Jim.All right.

02:40.812 --> 02:43.032
You think they liked me?

02:45.252 --> 02:47.428
ADULT SHELDON:
In the world of collecting,

02:47.471 --> 02:49.299
I'm what's known
as a completist.

02:49.343 --> 02:52.607
For example, I own
every gauge of model train

02:52.650 --> 02:54.130
from the mighty "G,"

02:54.174 --> 02:55.610
to the tiny "T."

02:55.653 --> 02:59.135
Look at how cute it is,
I just want to eat it up.

02:59.179 --> 03:02.094
However, the downside
of being a completist

03:02.138 --> 03:03.661
is when something's missing,

03:03.705 --> 03:06.011
it's like
an itch you can't scratch,

03:06.055 --> 03:07.665
even if you own a complete set

03:07.709 --> 03:09.363
of Justice League
back scratchers...

03:09.406 --> 03:10.929
which I do.

03:10.973 --> 03:15.020
In this case that itch
was the comic book issue

03:15.064 --> 03:17.501
Doom Patrol
and Suicide Squad Special #1.

03:17.545 --> 03:18.850
What do you mean,
you sold it?

03:18.894 --> 03:20.025
Somebody gave me money,

03:20.069 --> 03:21.505
and I gave them the comic book.

03:21.549 --> 03:22.680
That's kind of
how things work here.

03:22.724 --> 03:24.116
But there was a note on file.

03:24.160 --> 03:25.117
If one became available,

03:25.161 --> 03:26.336
it was supposed to be
held for me.

03:26.380 --> 03:27.468
Sorry.

03:27.511 --> 03:28.599
But there was
a note on file.

03:28.643 --> 03:29.731
I didn't see a note.

03:29.774 --> 03:31.472
Did you even check the file?

03:31.515 --> 03:33.735
I can't help you.
The comic is gone.

03:34.562 --> 03:35.693
Well, who'd you sell it to?

03:35.737 --> 03:37.217
I don't know, some guy.

03:37.260 --> 03:38.479
Which guy?

03:38.522 --> 03:39.871
Some weird guy.

03:39.915 --> 03:43.658
That doesn't narrow it down,
and you know it.

03:44.659 --> 03:47.314
How was your dinner
with Mandy?

03:47.357 --> 03:49.098
We ran into
her parents.

03:49.141 --> 03:50.795
Oh, and how did that go?

03:50.839 --> 03:52.667
About as weird as you'd think.

03:52.710 --> 03:55.931
Hmm. They still don't want
anything to do with her?

03:55.974 --> 03:58.107
Nope. She was pretty upset.

03:58.150 --> 04:00.196
Poor thing.

04:00.240 --> 04:03.286
Were you mad at Mom
for getting pregnant?

04:03.330 --> 04:04.940
Oh, yeah.

04:04.983 --> 04:06.376
Did you stop
talking to her?

04:06.420 --> 04:09.553
Hell no, I wanted her
to hear how pissed off I was.

04:09.597 --> 04:12.382
But all that
being mad at her

04:12.426 --> 04:13.775
just was a waste of time.

04:13.818 --> 04:15.211
What made you come around?

04:15.255 --> 04:17.779
I guess you showing up.

04:17.822 --> 04:20.434
I do have a natural charm,
don't I?

04:20.477 --> 04:22.653
You did,

04:22.697 --> 04:25.395
and then you learned to talk.

04:25.439 --> 04:27.223
[chuckles] [telephone rings]

04:27.267 --> 04:28.137
MAN:
Hello?

04:28.180 --> 04:29.530
Hello, Nathan. Sheldon Cooper.

04:29.573 --> 04:31.532
Oh, hey. How's it going?

04:31.575 --> 04:33.098
Terrible, thank you for asking.

04:33.142 --> 04:34.839
I understand that you
recently purchased

04:34.883 --> 04:36.885
Doom Patrol
Suicide Squad Special Issue #1

04:36.928 --> 04:38.321
from King Kong Comics.

04:38.365 --> 04:40.671
Yeah, I've been trying to
track it down forever.

04:40.715 --> 04:42.630
Me too. They were supposed
to hold it for me.

04:42.673 --> 04:43.935
I had a note on file.

04:43.979 --> 04:45.676
The girl there
didn't say anything.

04:45.720 --> 04:47.243
That "girl there" is my sister,

04:47.287 --> 04:49.245
and she should have
because I had a note on file.

04:49.289 --> 04:51.813
Your sister works there?
That's so cool.

04:51.856 --> 04:53.423
If it was cool, I would have

04:53.467 --> 04:56.339
Doom Patrol Suicide Squad
Special Issue #1.

04:56.383 --> 04:59.473
Yeah, I have it. It's great.

04:59.516 --> 05:01.126
Let me buy it from you.

05:01.170 --> 05:03.694
Ooh. Sorry, little man.
No can do.

05:03.738 --> 05:05.043
Please,
it's the only thing I need

05:05.087 --> 05:06.436
to complete my collection.

05:06.480 --> 05:08.351
I'll tell you what,

05:08.395 --> 05:09.961
you know Secret Wars #8?

05:10.005 --> 05:11.789
When Spider-Man
receives his black costume?

05:11.833 --> 05:12.790
Yeah, I'm familiar.

05:12.834 --> 05:13.922
Yeah, well, I need it

05:13.965 --> 05:15.358
to complete my collection.

05:15.402 --> 05:18.100
Find it
and Suicide Squadis yours.

05:18.143 --> 05:19.580
You got it.

05:19.623 --> 05:21.277
Ciao.

05:22.800 --> 05:24.324
ADULT SHELDON:
I was on a mission.

05:24.367 --> 05:26.064
All I had to do was

05:26.108 --> 05:28.371
turn to the power
of the Internet for help.

05:28.415 --> 05:29.459
[line ringing]

05:29.503 --> 05:33.637
[modem screeching]

05:33.681 --> 05:35.509
Unfortunately in 1992,

05:35.552 --> 05:38.207
that power had a long way to go.

05:38.250 --> 05:39.600
[clears throat]

05:39.643 --> 05:41.297
[modem static]

05:41.341 --> 05:44.169
[beeps and static]

05:44.213 --> 05:46.868
I do kind of miss that sound.

05:46.911 --> 05:49.740
[air impact wrench whirring]

05:50.698 --> 05:53.483
Hey, Mr. McAllister,
remember me?

05:53.527 --> 05:55.398
You're kind of hard to forget.

05:55.442 --> 06:00.360
Thank you.
I was hoping we could talk.

06:00.403 --> 06:01.665
Oh, uh, yeah.

06:01.709 --> 06:03.014
You know, this might
not be the best time...

06:03.058 --> 06:04.189
What's he doing here?

06:04.233 --> 06:05.408
Oh, hey.

06:05.452 --> 06:07.932
You work here, too. Hi.

06:07.976 --> 06:10.718
He wanted to talk.Great.

06:11.545 --> 06:13.329
Let's talk about how
we busted our butts

06:13.373 --> 06:14.678
to send Amanda to college,

06:14.722 --> 06:16.376
give her opportunities
we never had,

06:16.419 --> 06:18.029
and now she's knocked up

06:18.073 --> 06:19.466
and right back in Medford.

06:19.509 --> 06:21.424
Let's talk about that.

06:22.599 --> 06:25.297
Well, my meemaw likes to say

06:25.341 --> 06:27.561
that every baby
brings a little luck.

06:29.998 --> 06:32.000
Yeah, that's...
what she likes to say.

06:38.441 --> 06:40.400
Look, I know you're
not happy about it,

06:40.443 --> 06:41.792
but you're gonna
have a grandkid.

06:41.836 --> 06:44.578
And cutting Mandy out
ain't gonna change that.

06:44.621 --> 06:46.406
He's not wrong.

06:46.449 --> 06:47.972
Well, he's not right either.

06:48.016 --> 06:51.541
You know, it doesn't necessarily
have to be a bad thing.

06:51.585 --> 06:53.064
My mom got pregnant with me

06:53.108 --> 06:54.631
before she
and my dad got married.

06:54.675 --> 06:56.633
So you're gonna
marry my daughter?

06:56.677 --> 06:58.896
Well, if she'd stop saying "No."

06:58.940 --> 07:00.289
Well, that's something.

07:00.332 --> 07:01.812
Jim.All right.

07:01.856 --> 07:04.772
Why won't she marry you?
What's wrong with you?

07:04.815 --> 07:06.382
Hmm. Tough to say.

07:06.426 --> 07:09.167
Maybe I'm too ambitious
and put work first sometimes.

07:09.211 --> 07:11.605
You know what,
I do the same thing.

07:12.301 --> 07:13.998
I do.

07:14.042 --> 07:15.870
Well, it was lovely
to see you both.

07:15.913 --> 07:17.437
Maybe someday
you can tell me more

07:17.480 --> 07:19.526
about the tire business.
I bet it's fascinating.

07:19.569 --> 07:20.831
Oh, well, I'd like that.

07:20.875 --> 07:22.616
You know, my son
takes no interest in it.

07:22.659 --> 07:24.052
His loss.

07:24.705 --> 07:26.446
Goodbye, Mr. Cooper.

07:26.489 --> 07:27.882
Goodbye, ma'am.

07:29.144 --> 07:31.625
Steel-belted radials,
who came up with that?

07:31.668 --> 07:32.843
Oh, that was Michelin.

07:32.887 --> 07:35.411
Oh, yeah.
There you go.

07:35.455 --> 07:37.021
[laughs]

07:37.805 --> 07:39.110
He asked.

07:43.811 --> 07:45.290
Sheldon...

07:45.334 --> 07:46.509
Hello.

07:46.553 --> 07:49.686
Are you comfortable?
Can I get you anything?

07:49.730 --> 07:51.209
I wouldn't say no to a water.

07:51.253 --> 07:53.951
I wasn't being sincere.
Why are you at my desk?

07:53.995 --> 07:56.606
I needed to use your modem
to check my bulletin board.

07:56.650 --> 07:58.216
Why can't you use the library?

07:58.260 --> 07:59.827
Then I wouldn't get
to see you, silly.

07:59.870 --> 08:01.045
Ooh, I got a response.

08:01.089 --> 08:02.917
Someone named RedWolf

08:02.960 --> 08:04.048
has the comic I'm looking for.

08:04.092 --> 08:06.137
Oh, joy.
Oh, dear.

08:06.181 --> 08:08.531
Someone named Sucka MC
just offered to buy it.

08:08.575 --> 08:09.793
Riveting.

08:09.837 --> 08:12.579
RedWolf sold it.
This is a disaster.

08:12.622 --> 08:13.797
That's too bad. Move.

08:13.841 --> 08:15.103
[frustrated groan]

08:15.146 --> 08:17.061
These message boards
are so frustrating.

08:17.105 --> 08:19.020
You have to post
what you're looking for,

08:19.063 --> 08:20.238
then hope someone responds,

08:20.282 --> 08:21.892
and then hope you see the reply

08:21.936 --> 08:24.112
before they sell it
to someone named Sucka MC.

08:24.155 --> 08:25.896
Oh, you're frustrated?
I'm sorry.

08:25.940 --> 08:27.942
I can only imagine
what that feels like.

08:27.985 --> 08:29.596
Too bad there's not
a comic book database

08:29.639 --> 08:31.815
so I could search through it
and find what I'm looking for.

08:31.859 --> 08:33.556
Well, CERN
has something similar.

08:33.600 --> 08:35.906
You can search a database
of scientific papers.

08:35.950 --> 08:37.952
But there's no database
for comic books.

08:37.995 --> 08:40.737
You should make one.
Somewhere else.

08:40.781 --> 08:42.260
Mmm, sounds like a lot of work.

08:42.304 --> 08:43.827
Or does it sound like
a lot of fun?

08:43.871 --> 08:45.133
Go find out.

08:45.176 --> 08:47.265
Do you want to do it with me?

08:48.092 --> 08:51.269
Only if you share credit,
and my name comes first.

08:51.313 --> 08:53.097
Never mind.

08:53.881 --> 08:56.405
I knew that would work.

08:58.189 --> 08:59.930
What the hell were you thinking?

08:59.974 --> 09:01.366
What'd you do?

09:01.410 --> 09:02.672
What'd I do?

09:02.716 --> 09:04.718
You went and talked to
my folks behind my back?

09:04.761 --> 09:06.110
Oh, Georgie.

09:06.154 --> 09:08.286
I was trying to patch
things up between 'em.

09:08.330 --> 09:09.853
That's none of your business.

09:09.897 --> 09:12.421
Our baby's gonna be
their grandkid.

09:12.464 --> 09:13.553
So?

09:13.596 --> 09:15.467
So we're gonna need
free babysitters.

09:15.511 --> 09:16.947
He's got you on that one.

09:16.991 --> 09:19.384
[sighs] They cut me off.

09:19.428 --> 09:21.299
If they want to be
a part of this kid's life,

09:21.343 --> 09:23.171
then they can start
by apologizing.

09:23.214 --> 09:25.608
I don't know,
your mom don't seem like

09:25.652 --> 09:27.088
the apologetic type of gal.

09:27.131 --> 09:28.742
Oh, so now you're
the expert on my parents?

09:28.785 --> 09:31.614
I got a handle on your dad.
Your mom, she's a tougher nut.

09:31.658 --> 09:33.311
She kind of reminds me of you.

09:40.188 --> 09:42.494
You think that was
smart or dumb?

09:42.538 --> 09:43.887
Dumb.

09:44.975 --> 09:47.325
Missy, I need to speak
with your manager.

09:47.369 --> 09:49.632
I didn't mean to sell
your stupid comic book.

09:49.676 --> 09:50.894
It's not about that,

09:50.938 --> 09:52.156
although I'm still
upset about that,

09:52.200 --> 09:53.418
and will be
for as long as I live.

09:53.462 --> 09:54.768
Then why do you need
to talk to him for?

09:54.811 --> 09:56.291
I have a business proposal.

09:56.334 --> 09:58.336
It touches on the burgeoning
field of informatics

09:58.380 --> 10:00.251
and could revolutionize...Nigel!

10:05.822 --> 10:07.476
[sighs]

10:09.086 --> 10:10.958
What are you doing?

10:11.001 --> 10:13.438
Oh, you know,
just one of them days.

10:13.482 --> 10:14.918
Put that back.

10:14.962 --> 10:16.398
I'll split it with you.

10:16.441 --> 10:17.660
No.

10:17.704 --> 10:19.270
Fine.

10:21.708 --> 10:22.839
What's going on?

10:22.883 --> 10:24.536
Mandy's pissed at me.

10:24.580 --> 10:25.842
I believe that.

10:25.886 --> 10:27.409
Pretty sure her folks are, too.

10:27.452 --> 10:29.367
She introduced you
to her folks?

10:29.411 --> 10:31.718
Mmm, I sort of
introduced myself to them,

10:31.761 --> 10:33.154
and it didn't go great.

10:33.197 --> 10:34.808
Well, you're ass
ain't full of buckshot,

10:34.851 --> 10:36.200
so it could have gone worse.

10:36.244 --> 10:38.202
I don't know,
it feels pretty bad.

10:38.246 --> 10:40.727
Your Pop Pop decked me once.

10:40.770 --> 10:42.816
No.
Oh, yeah.

10:42.859 --> 10:45.688
Got me good.
But it all worked out.

10:45.732 --> 10:47.298
He end up liking you?

10:47.342 --> 10:49.126
He died.

10:50.301 --> 10:52.826
So if you let me build
a searchable database

10:52.869 --> 10:54.175
of all your titles,
then theoretically,

10:54.218 --> 10:56.090
anyone in the world
can see your inventory.

10:56.133 --> 10:57.700
That sounds all right.

10:57.744 --> 10:59.789
All right?
This is revolutionary.

10:59.833 --> 11:00.747
Other comic book stores
will follow suit,

11:00.790 --> 11:02.096
and someday,
if you want to find

11:02.139 --> 11:04.664
Doom Patrol and Suicide Squad
Special Issue #1,

11:04.707 --> 11:06.187
then all you'll have
to do is type it in.

11:06.230 --> 11:07.797
I just sold one of those.

11:07.841 --> 11:09.669
Despite the note on file,

11:09.712 --> 11:11.496
but that's
water under the bridge.

11:11.540 --> 11:15.109
So you're gonna input my whole
inventory free of charge?

11:15.152 --> 11:16.676
Yes.Well, can you do it

11:16.719 --> 11:18.068
at night so you're
not in the way?

11:18.112 --> 11:20.767
My bedtime is 9:30,
so that's a solid two hours.

11:20.810 --> 11:22.290
Well, there's
a lot of comics here.

11:22.333 --> 11:23.770
How long is this gonna take?

11:23.813 --> 11:26.294
This is quite the undertaking.
Would you like to help?

11:26.337 --> 11:27.599
You got it.

11:27.643 --> 11:29.993
Missy, you're working
late tonight.

11:30.820 --> 11:32.822
[sighs]:
Freaking Sheldon.

11:44.007 --> 11:46.618
Can't believe this is
how I'm spending my night.

11:46.662 --> 11:48.533
I know, alone
in a comic book store.

11:48.577 --> 11:49.621
A dream come true.

11:49.665 --> 11:51.014
Your dreams are sad.

11:51.058 --> 11:53.582
Hmm. At least
they've been realized.

11:53.625 --> 11:55.453
So what do we got to do?

11:55.497 --> 11:57.281
We just need to
take every comic book

11:57.325 --> 11:59.719
and input the title and issue
number into the computer.

11:59.762 --> 12:02.547
Fine, I'll call them out,
you type them up.

12:04.767 --> 12:08.510
New Teen Titans #42.

12:08.553 --> 12:09.598
Got it.

12:09.641 --> 12:12.079
New Teen Titans #43.

12:12.122 --> 12:13.080
Got it.

12:13.123 --> 12:14.821
New Mutants #87.

12:14.864 --> 12:17.519
Why would New Mutants
be next to New Teen Titans?

12:17.562 --> 12:19.521
Because they both
start with "New"?

12:19.564 --> 12:22.393
But one's Marvel
and the other's DC.

12:22.437 --> 12:24.744
Would you put Aquaman and
Sub-Mariner next to each other?

12:24.787 --> 12:27.485
I don't know, they could
talk about fish.

12:27.529 --> 12:29.183
This is madness.

12:29.226 --> 12:30.750
I have to fix this.

12:30.793 --> 12:33.361
Aren't we here to type
stuff into the computer?

12:33.404 --> 12:35.493
There's no reason
we can't do both.

12:35.537 --> 12:37.365
It's gonna take forever.

12:37.408 --> 12:39.759
We could use some help.

12:40.760 --> 12:42.805
A comic book store after hours.

12:42.849 --> 12:44.633
It's a dream come true.

12:44.676 --> 12:46.504
And we get to
organize it.

12:46.548 --> 12:48.376
We don't have to.

12:48.419 --> 12:49.681
Don't listen to her,

12:49.725 --> 12:50.639
she doesn't
appreciate the dream.

12:50.682 --> 12:52.162
[doorbell rings]

12:54.425 --> 12:55.644
May I help you?

12:55.687 --> 12:57.254
Are you Mary Cooper?

12:57.298 --> 12:59.387
I am, and you are?

12:59.430 --> 13:01.171
Jim McAllister.

13:02.129 --> 13:04.218
I'm Mandy's dad.

13:04.261 --> 13:06.481
Oh! Oh...

13:06.524 --> 13:07.656
George!

13:07.699 --> 13:09.658
Okay, so we're agreed,

13:09.701 --> 13:11.791
we'll have Marvel over here,
DC over there,

13:11.834 --> 13:13.140
and indies in the back.

13:13.183 --> 13:15.403
But within each section,
how do we organize them?

13:15.446 --> 13:17.057
Alphabetical, by title.

13:17.100 --> 13:18.841
But then you'd have
Amazing Spidermanin the A's,

13:18.885 --> 13:20.060
Spectacular Spiderman
in the S's,

13:20.103 --> 13:22.236
and Web of Spiderman
in the W's.

13:22.279 --> 13:23.846
You see the insanity.

13:23.890 --> 13:26.762
Okay. So we'll do it
alphabetical by character.

13:26.806 --> 13:29.852
But then we file
Superman's Pal, Jimmy Olsen

13:29.896 --> 13:31.723
under "J" for "Jimmy"
or "S" for "Superman"?

13:31.767 --> 13:34.770
How about under "I"
for I'm going home.

13:37.251 --> 13:40.341
What if we go crazy
and organize them by artist?

13:40.384 --> 13:43.431
All the Steve Ditkos
in one place? 'Nuff said.

13:43.474 --> 13:44.780
Yeah.

13:44.824 --> 13:48.697
So, Jim, your daughter
is just lovely.

13:48.740 --> 13:51.700
Oh, thanks.
And, uh, your son seems...

13:53.006 --> 13:54.268
...brave.

13:54.311 --> 13:56.183
Brave, dumb,

13:56.226 --> 13:57.445
it's a coin toss.

13:57.488 --> 13:58.750
What can we help you with?

13:58.794 --> 14:00.927
Oh, well, uh,
I got some money here,

14:00.970 --> 14:03.886
and I was just hoping
y'all could give it to Mandy.

14:03.930 --> 14:06.236
She's just right across
the street at my mom's.

14:06.280 --> 14:07.934
You could give it
to her yourself.

14:07.977 --> 14:12.025
Oh, no, I couldn't
do that and stay married.

14:12.068 --> 14:13.896
Sounds like we got
the same wife.

14:13.940 --> 14:15.115
George.
[laughs]

14:15.158 --> 14:17.291
Just trying to lighten
the mood, honey.

14:17.334 --> 14:18.292
I-I'll make sure she gets it.

14:18.335 --> 14:19.815
Thank you.

14:19.859 --> 14:22.513
I'm sure your wife will
come around eventually.

14:22.557 --> 14:24.820
Well, I'm hoping that
when she sees the baby,

14:24.864 --> 14:27.649
that ice cube in her chest
might start to melt.

14:27.692 --> 14:30.304
Yep, same wife.

14:32.306 --> 14:33.611
Come on, it's funny.

14:36.832 --> 14:38.181
So, you can just type in

14:38.225 --> 14:39.748
whatever comic
you're looking for,

14:39.791 --> 14:41.271
and the computer will
tell you who has it?

14:41.315 --> 14:42.925
Once enough people
enter their inventories

14:42.969 --> 14:44.361
in the database, yes.

14:44.405 --> 14:46.015
That's really cool.

14:46.059 --> 14:48.104
Would you say
it's revolutionary?

14:48.148 --> 14:49.410
I would.

14:49.453 --> 14:50.541
Will you?

14:50.585 --> 14:52.065
It's revolutionary.

14:52.108 --> 14:53.544
Thanks.

14:53.588 --> 14:57.679
Could it be used
to catalog other things?

14:57.722 --> 14:59.550
Yes, the applications
are endless.

14:59.594 --> 15:01.683
So there could be
a database of,

15:01.726 --> 15:04.251
I don't know,
available women?

15:04.294 --> 15:05.513
Available for what?

15:05.556 --> 15:07.080
At this point, anything.

15:07.123 --> 15:09.517
Ooh, there could be ones
for scientific grants.

15:09.560 --> 15:10.953
Yeah, or my idea.

15:10.997 --> 15:13.216
Finding grants is such
a time-consuming process.

15:13.260 --> 15:14.957
If there was
a centralized database,

15:15.001 --> 15:16.828
it would change the research
landscape entirely.

15:16.872 --> 15:18.178
Yeah, that's cool, I guess.

15:18.221 --> 15:20.702
And many grants
never get applied for

15:20.745 --> 15:23.444
because people
don't know about them,

15:23.487 --> 15:26.969
so this would be good for
the grantor and the grantee.

15:27.752 --> 15:29.798
Well, shouldn't we
finish this first?

15:29.841 --> 15:31.887
This idea is too big to wait.

15:31.931 --> 15:34.063
I got to go.
Will you lock up?

15:35.717 --> 15:38.546
[door bells jingle]

15:38.589 --> 15:40.809
I'm gonna steal so much stuff.

15:40.852 --> 15:42.071
[knock on door]

15:44.595 --> 15:45.901
What?

15:45.945 --> 15:47.947
I was wrong, go ahead
and yell at me.

15:47.990 --> 15:50.558
It's not up to you.
I decide when I'm gonna yell.

15:50.601 --> 15:52.212
Okay, which way you leaning?

15:52.255 --> 15:54.127
What the hell is wrong with you?
You went to his store?

15:54.170 --> 15:56.303
Is it his?
'Cause your mom

15:56.346 --> 15:58.044
seems to be calling
all the shots.

15:58.087 --> 15:59.567
[sighs]

15:59.610 --> 16:01.482
Is that my dad's truck?

16:01.525 --> 16:04.050
Well, Mandy's not gonna
apologize to her mom,

16:04.093 --> 16:06.530
and her mom's not
gonna apologize to her,

16:06.574 --> 16:09.011
so I got to figure out
some way to broker the peace.

16:09.055 --> 16:12.232
Maybe we could have everyone
over here for dinner.

16:12.275 --> 16:14.408
Mary, when has
that ever worked?

16:14.451 --> 16:16.410
Food is healing, George.

16:16.453 --> 16:17.759
You should know.

16:17.802 --> 16:20.718
Hey.
What? I'm just
lightening the mood.

16:20.762 --> 16:21.763
[door opens]

16:21.806 --> 16:23.678
What are you doing here?

16:23.721 --> 16:25.071
Oh, hi, sweetie.

16:25.114 --> 16:26.768
Yeah, hi.
What are you doing here?

16:26.811 --> 16:29.031
Mandy, your mom
and dad miss you.

16:29.075 --> 16:31.251
Then they
should be talking to me.

16:31.294 --> 16:33.209
Well, you know how
stubborn your mom can be.

16:33.253 --> 16:34.776
Too well.

16:34.819 --> 16:36.256
But, uh...

16:36.299 --> 16:38.998
maybe she's not the only
one being stubborn.

16:39.041 --> 16:40.782
[scoffs]
Excuse me?

16:40.825 --> 16:43.089
I came to you for help
and you kicked me out.

16:43.132 --> 16:45.656
Okay, how about
we all take a breath.

16:45.700 --> 16:48.355
Ooh, I could
make brownies.
Mary.

16:48.398 --> 16:50.052
Look, this is my life.

16:50.096 --> 16:51.662
If y'all want to be
a part of it,

16:51.706 --> 16:52.663
you know where to find me.

16:52.707 --> 16:53.838
Yeah.

16:53.882 --> 16:56.102
Oh, don't help me.

16:57.842 --> 17:00.280
Good to see you, Mr. McAllister.

17:02.760 --> 17:04.240
MANDY:
Quit following me.

17:05.676 --> 17:07.461
Food would have helped.

17:13.989 --> 17:15.295
So, as you can see on
the chart on page 34,

17:15.338 --> 17:17.036
the amount of time spent
searching for grants

17:17.079 --> 17:18.689
would be cut by 80%.

17:18.733 --> 17:20.126
Do you see what this could do
for the scientific community?

17:20.169 --> 17:22.519
Yes. We could charge
an access fee

17:22.563 --> 17:24.260
to every university
on the planet,

17:24.304 --> 17:28.047
and I can retire
on a yacht in the Bahamas.

17:28.090 --> 17:29.787
You're missing the point.

17:29.831 --> 17:30.745
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

17:30.788 --> 17:31.920
Uh, good for science.
I love it.

17:31.963 --> 17:34.575
So, our next step is
we get legal involved

17:34.618 --> 17:36.098
and start drawing up
the contracts.

17:36.142 --> 17:38.492
