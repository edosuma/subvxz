00:43.586 --> 00:47.715
<i>China is a land
of myth and mystery.</i>

00:48.341 --> 00:52.136
<i>Almost inconceivably vast and diverse.</i>

00:55.932 --> 00:58.184
<i>From the eastern coastal plain...</i>

00:59.269 --> 01:01.980
<i>through mountain ranges and forests...</i>

01:04.649 --> 01:07.652
<i>to the high plateau of Qinghai.</i>

01:14.576 --> 01:16.911
<i>From this magnificent landscape</i>

01:16.995 --> 01:19.205
<i>are born countless lives.</i>

01:20.957 --> 01:24.085
<i>Each of them part
of a much larger story.</i>

01:28.590 --> 01:32.176
<i>An all-encompassing circle of life...</i>

01:32.343 --> 01:34.721
<i>that is fueled by the love...</i>

01:34.887 --> 01:37.599
<i>the losses, and the hopes...</i>

01:37.765 --> 01:39.726
<i>of many different creatures.</i>

01:58.077 --> 02:01.456
<i>Our story takes place far
from the bustling cities...</i>

02:01.623 --> 02:03.833
<i>we often think of as China.</i>

02:09.714 --> 02:12.383
<i>It is a story of cranes...</i>

02:12.800 --> 02:14.344
<i>pandas"...</i>

02:14.510 --> 02:16.054
<i>antelope...</i>

02:16.220 --> 02:17.597
<i>monkeys...</i>

02:17.764 --> 02:19.098
<i>and leopards.</i>

02:20.266 --> 02:24.187
<i>All of whom call China their home.</i>

02:55.510 --> 02:58.721
<i>Among all the creatures
in Chinese mythology...</i>

02:58.888 --> 03:02.266
<i>the crane holds a very special place.</i>

03:04.977 --> 03:07.730
<i>A symbol of longevity
and good fortune...</i>

03:08.856 --> 03:09.899
<i>it is one of the oldest</i>

03:09.982 --> 03:12.735
<i>and most prominent figures
in Chinese art...</i>

03:12.902 --> 03:15.446
<i>dating back thousands of years.</i>

03:17.281 --> 03:20.702
<i>It is said that
when a crane takes flight...</i>

03:20.868 --> 03:24.330
<i>it carries along the spirit
of a departed creature...</i>

03:25.665 --> 03:29.293
<i>from this world to the next.</i>

03:47.603 --> 03:50.231
<i>The Qinghai Plateau in western China...</i>

03:50.398 --> 03:53.317
<i>is the highest
mountain plateau on Earth.</i>

03:53.484 --> 03:56.779
<i>And here, the elusive snow leopard...</i>

03:56.946 --> 03:58.740
<i>rules the range.</i>

03:59.991 --> 04:01.868
<i>This is Dawa.</i>

04:03.161 --> 04:06.414
<i>And this incredible dreamscape
is her home.</i>

04:09.667 --> 04:13.379
<i>At an altitude of
14,000 feet above sea level...</i>

04:13.546 --> 04:16.882
<i>the climate here is
too cold for most mammals.</i>

04:18.301 --> 04:20.845
<i>But Dawa thrives here.</i>

04:29.145 --> 04:32.815
<i>Every part of her body
is designed for this unique terrain...</i>

04:34.192 --> 04:36.110
<i>from her exceptionally long tail...</i>

04:36.277 --> 04:38.362
<i>that helps her maintain balance...</i>

04:38.529 --> 04:40.615
<i>to her gray-dappled fur</i>

04:40.698 --> 04:42.700
<i>that provides the perfect camouflage...</i>

04:42.867 --> 04:45.161
<i>in these rocky surroundings.</i>

04:47.997 --> 04:50.583
<i>Dawa is at the top of her food chain...</i>

04:51.209 --> 04:53.336
<i>and at the top of her game.</i>

04:54.837 --> 04:58.466
<i>She knows every crag
and cranny of this mountain.</i>

04:59.342 --> 05:02.011
<i>This is her turf.</i>

05:07.058 --> 05:09.310
<i>But she's picked up a scent.</i>

05:10.853 --> 05:13.356
<i>An unwelcome visitor.</i>

05:21.239 --> 05:24.283
<i>The intruder knows
she's in Dawa's territory...</i>

05:25.409 --> 05:27.787
<i>but challenges her, nonetheless.</i>

05:37.255 --> 05:40.258
<i>They face off
in a chilling test of nerves.</i>

05:46.097 --> 05:50.935
<i>Dawa must convey strength
or risk a full-on battle.</i>

06:21.632 --> 06:24.218
<i>The intruder finally submits.</i>

06:31.893 --> 06:34.979
<i>Dawa retains her supremacy.</i>

06:39.734 --> 06:41.360
<i>For now.</i>

06:56.542 --> 06:59.420
<i>Dawa is not a feline
to be messed with...</i>

07:00.922 --> 07:04.091
<i>and right now nothing
could shake her resolve.</i>

07:07.678 --> 07:11.015
<i>After all, it's not just
her hunting grounds...</i>

07:11.182 --> 07:12.266
<i>she's protecting.</i>

07:28.032 --> 07:31.410
<i>To her, these two little cubs...</i>

07:31.577 --> 07:33.913
<i>are the most important things on Earth.</i>

07:36.374 --> 07:39.710
<i>Providing for them
and keeping them safe...</i>

07:39.877 --> 07:41.712
<i>is her life's mission.</i>

07:57.061 --> 07:59.438
<i>Far to the east of Dawa...</i>

07:59.605 --> 08:02.775
<i>in the Sichuan mountain
valleys of central China...</i>

08:02.942 --> 08:06.112
<i>a mere 8,000 feet above sea level...</i>

08:06.612 --> 08:10.241
<i>golden snub-nosed monkeys run wild.</i>

08:13.077 --> 08:16.914
<i>Monkeys have long been
figures of rebellion and mischief...</i>

08:17.081 --> 08:18.833
<i>in Chinese folk tales.</i>

08:19.834 --> 08:21.669
<i>And one of the most
mischievous monkeys</i>

08:21.752 --> 08:23.129
<i>on this mountain...</i>

08:23.295 --> 08:24.797
<i>is Tao Tao.</i>

08:25.756 --> 08:28.092
<i>He's the class clown of his troop...</i>

08:28.259 --> 08:31.429
<i>and an aspiring kung fu master.</i>

08:33.097 --> 08:34.097
<i>At two years old...</i>

08:34.640 --> 08:38.102
<i>Tao Tao no longer needs
to be overseen by his parents.</i>

08:38.644 --> 08:41.188
<i>But he still likes
to come home to his father's side...</i>

08:41.355 --> 08:44.025
<i>after a long day of adventuring.</i>

08:51.615 --> 08:54.618
<i>Tao Tao just loves his dad.</i>

08:56.954 --> 09:00.541
<i>His dad, however,
isn't big on showing affection...</i>

09:04.128 --> 09:08.132
<i>leaving TaoTao feeling
a little unappreciated.</i>

09:10.551 --> 09:11.886
<i>Oh, well.</i>

09:12.136 --> 09:15.556
<i>He can always count on his mother
to shower him with attention.</i>

09:19.060 --> 09:22.063
<i>But the recent arrival
of a new baby sister in the family...</i>

09:22.813 --> 09:26.776
<i>has spoiled some of
that maternal magic on the home front.</i>

09:30.571 --> 09:33.240
<i>While monkey families
only have one father...</i>

09:33.407 --> 09:35.451
<i>they each have several mothers,</i>

09:35.534 --> 09:37.745
<i>who all help one another
care for their young.</i>

09:47.171 --> 09:48.380
Tao Tao misses the days

09:48.464 --> 09:50.674
<i>when he used to be
the center of attention...</i>

09:52.593 --> 09:55.638
<i>despite the danger involved.</i>

09:56.764 --> 10:00.643
<i>He's quickly coming to the realization
that he's no longer...</i>

10:00.810 --> 10:02.561
<i>the darling of his family.</i>

10:05.231 --> 10:09.235
<i>This new little bundle of joy
has taken his place.</i>

10:10.444 --> 10:12.404
<i>It seems so unfair...</i>

10:12.571 --> 10:16.033
<i>when all the comfort and acceptance
you've gotten used to...</i>

10:16.200 --> 10:18.786
<i>is suddenly stolen from you.</i>

10:26.418 --> 10:28.671
<i>"Fine, forget it, then!"</i>

10:32.007 --> 10:35.970
<i>This is exactly the kind of thing
that makes a monkey turn to mischief.</i>

10:43.060 --> 10:44.979
<i>Right next door to Tao Tao...</i>

10:45.437 --> 10:48.983
<i>in a lush bamboo forest
on the other side of the mountain...</i>

10:50.234 --> 10:54.405
<i>life is decidedly less stressful.</i>

10:55.322 --> 10:57.449
<i>This is Ya Ya.</i>

10:58.409 --> 10:59.743
<i>A giant panda.</i>

11:01.078 --> 11:04.498
<i>Pandas are basically
the opposite of monkeys.</i>

11:05.082 --> 11:07.626
<i>They're not interested
in stirring up trouble.</i>

11:09.170 --> 11:12.256
<i>They just wanna be left alone to eat...</i>

11:13.924 --> 11:15.301
<i>and relax...</i>

11:18.679 --> 11:20.097
<i>and scratch...</i>

11:22.141 --> 11:24.602
<i>various, different areas.</i>

11:27.813 --> 11:30.983
<i>And once Ya Ya has completed
her morning chores...</i>

11:31.609 --> 11:33.944
<i>she returns to her real focus in life...</i>

11:36.363 --> 11:39.617
<i>her newborn daughter, MeiMei.</i>

11:43.996 --> 11:45.789
<i>Outside of raising cubs...</i>

11:45.956 --> 11:50.002
<i>adult female pandas
live almost completely solitary lives.</i>

11:52.796 --> 11:54.173
<i>So, for Ya Ya...</i>

11:54.965 --> 11:58.302
<i>this is the most
treasured time of her life.</i>

12:08.312 --> 12:11.273
<i>These two will be spending
the next several months...</i>

12:11.440 --> 12:13.692
<i>snuggled up here inside this den.</i>

12:15.945 --> 12:18.697
<i>But then they'll step out
into the world...</i>

12:20.991 --> 12:24.286
<i>and the real journey will begin.</i>

12:33.712 --> 12:36.507
<i>Up in the higher elevations
of western China...</i>

12:37.091 --> 12:40.844
a <i>very different kind
of family roams the plateau.</i>

12:44.390 --> 12:46.016
<i>Chiru antelope are worshipped...</i>

12:46.183 --> 12:48.811
<i>as sacred creatures in this region.</i>

12:50.521 --> 12:52.314
<i>They are the living embodiment...</i>

12:52.481 --> 12:55.401
<i>of nature's back-and-forth,
seasonal cycle.</i>

12:58.237 --> 13:01.323
<i>Every spring,
thousands of female chiru...</i>

13:01.490 --> 13:03.367
<i>embark on an epic journey.</i>

13:04.285 --> 13:06.620
<i>But it's a bittersweet occasion.</i>

13:06.787 --> 13:08.664
<i>They must bid farewell to the males...</i>

13:08.831 --> 13:11.709
<i>who will not see them again
for several months.</i>

13:19.258 --> 13:21.010
<i>In the meantime...</i>

13:21.844 --> 13:24.596
<i>these bucks will have to
make do on their own.</i>

13:28.434 --> 13:31.770
The migration of
<i>these</i> revered creatures...

13:31.937 --> 13:35.524
<i>washes across the mountain plains
of western China...</i>

13:35.691 --> 13:38.235
<i>like an ocean tide.</i>

13:40.738 --> 13:42.573
<i>Their destination?</i>

13:43.282 --> 13:45.993
<i>The legendary Zhuonai Lake...</i>

13:46.160 --> 13:48.370
<i>in the remote uplands
of the Qinghai Plateau.</i>

13:58.922 --> 14:00.841
<i>Dawa's cubs are now old enough...</i>

14:01.008 --> 14:04.053
<i>to venture outside their cave
into the sunshine.</i>

14:06.555 --> 14:09.683
<i>To them, this vast mountain range...</i>

14:09.850 --> 14:12.644
<i>is just one big rocky playground.</i>

14:27.409 --> 14:28.660
<i>Like pandas,</i>

14:28.744 --> 14:31.413
<i>adult snow leopards
live very solitary lives.</i>

14:32.539 --> 14:35.167
<i>So with no one infringing
on her territory...</i>

14:35.334 --> 14:38.379
<i>no competition
for Queen of the Mountain...</i>

14:38.545 --> 14:40.756
<i>she can focus all her attention...</i>

14:40.923 --> 14:42.341
<i>on her young.</i>

14:56.730 --> 14:59.400
<i>Dawa could not be more content.</i>

15:00.234 --> 15:04.947
<i>Nothing compares to being loved
by the ones you love most.</i>

15:14.164 --> 15:16.083
<i>And while Dawa would
love nothing more...</i>

15:16.250 --> 15:19.628
<i>than to just sit back
and watch them climb and play...</i>

15:20.504 --> 15:23.424
<i>she has other responsibilities.</i>

15:25.217 --> 15:27.469
<i>She needs to hunt.</i>

15:29.304 --> 15:31.640
<i>These yaks offer a bounty of meat...</i>

15:32.808 --> 15:36.103
<i>but are far too powerful and dangerous.</i>

15:37.855 --> 15:40.065
<i>She considers this marmot.</i>

15:43.110 --> 15:44.445
<i>No, she doesn't.</i>

15:45.070 --> 15:47.156
<i>But</i> these glorious creatures?

15:47.865 --> 15:50.826
<i>This is what dinner looks like.</i>

15:54.538 --> 15:57.708
<i>Bharal sheep are Dawa's main prey.</i>

16:04.548 --> 16:06.717
<i>Her intimate knowledge
of her home terrain...</i>

16:06.884 --> 16:09.887
<i>helps her locate her prey
and maneuver them...</i>

16:10.053 --> 16:12.097
<i>into rocky narrows and steep slopes...</i>

16:12.264 --> 16:14.975
<i>where they are
more vulnerable to attack.</i>

16:17.060 --> 16:20.481
<i>Like Dawa, these sheep are
built to survive in these mountains.</i>

16:22.107 --> 16:25.194
<i>Their blanched fur
is the ideal camouflage...</i>

16:25.360 --> 16:28.363
<i>and their strong legs
make them remarkably fast and nimble.</i>

16:39.082 --> 16:42.294
<i>But Dawa is smarter.</i>

16:45.672 --> 16:49.092
<i>Her cubs will go to sleep
with full stomachs tonight.</i>

16:50.802 --> 16:54.723
<i>This one meal
could tide them over for an entire week.</i>

16:58.393 --> 17:03.440
<i>In Dawa's world,
you must take life to give life.</i>

17:09.863 --> 17:13.157
<i>Tao Tao has become
increasingly dejected...</i>

17:13.325 --> 17:15.493
<i>and has been spending a lot of time...</i>

17:15.661 --> 17:19.330
<i>just trying to avoid his little sister,
and his family.</i>

17:20.332 --> 17:24.002
<i>But today, he's come across
some interesting neighbors...</i>

17:24.502 --> 17:25.837
<i>who could change all that.</i>

17:29.049 --> 17:31.426
<i>These are the Lost Boys...</i>

17:32.052 --> 17:34.429
<i>a gang of young male outcasts...</i>

17:34.596 --> 17:37.224
<i>some of them as young as TaoTao.</i>

17:39.810 --> 17:43.522
<i>These guys know all about rejection.</i>

17:45.899 --> 17:48.986
<i>Being a Lost Boy is sort of
like running away to join the circus...</i>

17:49.611 --> 17:51.738
<i>except with fewer rules.</i>

17:53.156 --> 17:56.243
<i>These kids don't seem
to have a care in the world.</i>

17:59.371 --> 18:01.373
<i>This is Rooster...</i>

18:03.375 --> 18:05.794
<i>the leader of the Lost Boys.</i>

18:07.879 --> 18:09.673
<i>He's been in a lot of battles.</i>

18:10.424 --> 18:12.301
<i>You see that eye?</i>

18:12.801 --> 18:15.470
<i>TaoTao's father had a hand in that.</i>

18:19.099 --> 18:21.852
<i>He's certainly taken notice of Tao Tao.</i>

18:22.686 --> 18:25.939
<i>Maybe Tao Tao reminds him
of himself at that age.</i>

18:27.190 --> 18:31.486
<i>Or maybe he just stares at stuff a lot.</i>

18:33.155 --> 18:34.865
<i>In any case, if Tao Tao
has been looking...</i>

18:35.032 --> 18:37.242
<i>for a way to vent his frustrations...</i>

18:37.743 --> 18:39.745
<i>he's come to the right place...</i>

18:39.911 --> 18:42.331
<i>because on this sunny afternoon...</i>

18:42.497 --> 18:44.291
<i>the Lost Boys have invited him...</i>

18:44.458 --> 18:47.044
<i>to play an ancient
traditional monkey game...</i>

18:47.836 --> 18:50.589
<i>called Let's Break Branches.</i>

19:11.777 --> 19:15.155
<i>This is exactly
what TaoTao needs right now.</i>

19:17.407 --> 19:20.994
<i>Some of their shenanigans, however,
go</i> a <i>little too far for Tao Tao.</i>

19:23.121 --> 19:24.956
<i>Like stealing a baby...</i>

19:25.123 --> 19:26.166
<i>for kicks?</i>

19:28.877 --> 19:29.878
<i>But hey...</i>

19:30.045 --> 19:31.838
<i>it's not like it's his sister.</i>

19:34.299 --> 19:36.426
<i>Being mischievous troublemakers...</i>

19:36.593 --> 19:38.637
<i>is exhausting work.</i>

19:40.138 --> 19:43.600
<i>For TaoTao, though,
life with the Lost Boys seems...</i>

19:44.226 --> 19:45.811
<i>pretty sweet.</i>

19:46.645 --> 19:47.729
<i>Until...</i>

19:50.232 --> 19:51.983
<i>Goshawks are virtually</i>

19:52.067 --> 19:54.528
<i>the only natural predators
these monkeys have.</i>

19:54.986 --> 19:58.573
<i>And they're always on the lookout
for abandoned babies.</i>

20:17.134 --> 20:20.512
<i>In the blink of an eye,
Tao Tee's world is turned upside down.</i>

20:22.431 --> 20:24.266
<i>That came out of nowhere.</i>

20:24.433 --> 20:26.977
<i>Why wasn't anyone
keeping an eye out?</i>

20:42.701 --> 20:45.787
<i>It's</i> a <i>harsh dose of reality for Tao Tao.</i>

20:45.954 --> 20:49.458
<i>That easily could have
been his little sister.</i>

21:17.068 --> 21:18.487
<i>The summer winds,</i>

21:18.570 --> 21:21.031
<i>carrying the warm scent
of fresh pastures...</i>

21:21.198 --> 21:24.367
<i>have led the chiru
to their sacred destination...</i>

21:25.452 --> 21:27.454
<i>Zhuonai Lake.</i>

21:30.874 --> 21:33.794
<i>And the real purpose
of their heroic journey...</i>

21:33.960 --> 21:36.213
<i>now reveals itself.</i>

21:43.553 --> 21:46.681
<i>The whole fantastic, continuous cycle...</i>

21:46.848 --> 21:48.809
<i>that is chiru existence...</i>

21:48.975 --> 21:51.478
<i>is built on
this first moment of bonding...</i>

21:51.645 --> 21:53.772
<i>between a mother and her baby...</i>

21:54.523 --> 21:56.608
<i>sharing each other's scent.</i>

22:03.448 --> 22:06.159
<i>Miraculously, baby chiru
are able to walk...</i>

22:06.326 --> 22:08.954
<i>within 30 minutes of being born.</i>

22:12.666 --> 22:15.585
<i>It's that "standing still"
part that's so difficult.</i>

22:32.853 --> 22:34.688
<i>Within a few days,</i>

22:34.771 --> 22:37.148
<i>they can run like their mothers.</i>

23:06.177 --> 23:10.473
<i>As mothers and their calves
learn to identify each other by smell...</i>

23:10.640 --> 23:14.144
<i>they're forming the essential,
unbreakable connections...</i>

23:14.311 --> 23:15.770
<i>that bind the herd together</i>

23:15.854 --> 23:19.482
<i>and allow it to survive
its return migration.</i>

23:20.442 --> 23:22.444
<i>Sometimes, it takes a while...</i>

23:22.611 --> 23:25.864
<i>for calves to figure out
whose smell is whose...</i>

23:26.031 --> 23:29.534
<i>and they are gently encouraged
to keep sniffing.</i>

23:49.971 --> 23:52.974
<i>The chiru will stay here
until the calves are capable...</i>

23:53.183 --> 23:55.352
<i>of making their long return journey.</i>

23:56.478 --> 23:59.564
<i>Then their pendulum
will swing back toward home...</i>

23:59.731 --> 24:03.234
<i>where they'll be reunited
with the males they left behind.</i>

24:14.037 --> 24:15.872
<i>Up in the mountains of Sichuan...</i>

24:16.039 --> 24:18.208
<i>the turn of seasons unfurls...</i>

24:18.375 --> 24:21.336
<i>in a breathtaking kaleidoscope of color.</i>

24:41.898 --> 24:46.569
<i>Ya Ya and her baby have finally
emerged from their den of solitude.</i>

24:48.279 --> 24:51.408
<i>It's time for MeiMei to meet the world.</i>

25:31.406 --> 25:34.784
<i>"Well, the baby's been fed...</i>

25:36.161 --> 25:37.954
<i>"and cuddled...</i>

25:38.997 --> 25:40.623
<i>"and put to bed."</i>

25:44.461 --> 25:46.254
<i>"Time for lunch."</i>

25:58.808 --> 26:03.104
<i>Pandas in the wild
eat almost nothing but bamboo.</i>

26:03.646 --> 26:05.857
<i>Up to 40 pounds per day.</i>

26:09.027 --> 26:10.445
40...

26:10.612 --> 26:11.988
<i>pounds...</i>

26:12.697 --> 26:14.491
<i>of bamboo...</i>

26:14.949 --> 26:16.493
<i>per day.</i>

26:22.957 --> 26:25.794
<i>MeiMei, however,
has a belly full of mother's milk...</i>

26:25.960 --> 26:27.629
<i>and is fully rested.</i>

26:28.963 --> 26:31.841
<i>And there's a whole
new world to explore.</i>

26:39.724 --> 26:41.476
<i>Right.</i>

26:41.643 --> 26:43.228
<i>She can't really go anywhere.</i>

26:43.394 --> 26:47.190
<i>At this age, panda cubs
have barely learned to crawl.</i>

26:50.527 --> 26:52.695
<i>But that doesn't diminish
her fascination...</i>

26:52.862 --> 26:55.323
<i>with all these new sights and sounds.</i>

26:58.827 --> 27:00.370
<i>Like this guy.</i>

27:05.875 --> 27:07.544
<i>A red panda.</i>

27:08.211 --> 27:10.672
<i>He's not really a panda at all.</i>

27:10.839 --> 27:13.383
<i>He's actually closer to a raccoon.</i>

27:14.217 --> 27:16.553
<i>MeiMei doesn't care what he is.</i>

27:16.719 --> 27:19.681
<i>She just wants to
climb up there and say hello.</i>

27:20.348 --> 27:23.726
<i>Red pandas spend
almost all their time up in trees...</i>

27:23.893 --> 27:26.604
<i>which makes him
a perfect role model for MeiMei.</i>

27:27.272 --> 27:29.357
<i>Because climbing trees...</i>

27:29.524 --> 27:32.235
<i>is all baby pandas dream about.</i>

27:38.241 --> 27:40.869
<i>There's so much beauty.</i>

27:43.121 --> 27:44.622
<i>It's entrancing.</i>

27:47.917 --> 27:49.919
<i>But behind the beauty...</i>

27:51.754 --> 27:53.381
<i>lurks danger.</i>

28:06.269 --> 28:08.813
<i>"Okay?"</i>

28:11.941 --> 28:14.736
<i>"And here we go again."</i>

28:33.963 --> 28:35.506
<i>"Oh, my gosh.</i>

28:35.673 --> 28:39.260
<i>"That was so embarrassing."</i>

29:16.547 --> 29:20.343
<i>Moms are always there
to pick you up when you fall down.</i>

29:22.679 --> 29:25.890
<i>And to drag you around
by the neck afterward.</i>

29:36.985 --> 29:38.528
<i>If she could...</i>

29:38.695 --> 29:42.198
<i>Ya Ya would stay
in this moment forever.</i>

29:44.867 --> 29:46.703
<i>All she wants to do
is hold onto her baby...</i>

29:46.869 --> 29:49.372
<i>and smother her with love.</i>

29:55.044 --> 29:58.214
<i>But MeiMei has had a taste of freedom.</i>

30:02.051 --> 30:03.761
<i>And she likes it.</i>

30:22.405 --> 30:25.116
<i>Pine nuts are only
available in the fall...</i>

30:25.283 --> 30:27.118
<i>and today Rooster and the Lost Boys...</i>

30:27.285 --> 30:29.704
<i>have found a nice patch
all to themselves.</i>

30:31.414 --> 30:34.917
<i>And Tao Tao is making sure
he gets his fair share.</i>

30:36.794 --> 30:38.087
<i>"Whoops."</i>

30:40.298 --> 30:42.925
<i>He's been spending almost
all his time with the Lost Boys...</i>

30:43.426 --> 30:47.138
<i>ever since his cute little baby sister
swallowed up his family.</i>

30:55.730 --> 30:58.316
<i>But when TaoTao's father shows up...</i>

30:58.483 --> 31:00.401
<i>with the whole family in tow...</i>

31:00.985 --> 31:03.321
<i>the festive mood changes...</i>

31:04.405 --> 31:06.657
<i>to less festive.</i>

31:17.460 --> 31:20.630
<i>Rooster probably still has
a chip on his shoulder...</i>

31:20.797 --> 31:22.799
<i>about that whole eye thing.</i>

31:30.098 --> 31:33.142
<i>Looks like it's time
for some long-awaited payback.</i>

31:46.155 --> 31:47.532
<i>Tao Tao can't believe this.</i>

31:49.659 --> 31:52.662
<i>Why is Rooster
picking a fight with his father?</i>

31:58.042 --> 32:01.879
<i>The females in Tao Tao's family
rally around their man.</i>

32:09.345 --> 32:12.056
<i>Rooster, however, is on his own.</i>

32:12.682 --> 32:15.518
<i>The Lost Boys only
look out for themselves.</i>

32:16.561 --> 32:18.187
<i>With nobody to back him up...</i>

32:18.646 --> 32:20.815
<i>Rooster beats a hasty retreat.</i>

32:35.621 --> 32:37.123
<i>Tao Tao is torn.</i>

32:38.458 --> 32:42.920
<i>These new pals of his are turning out
to be a bunch of self-centered brats.</i>

32:49.760 --> 32:53.764
<i>Is there anybody in this crazy world
you can actually depend on?</i>

33:04.150 --> 33:05.985
<i>Up on the high plains...</i>

33:06.152 --> 33:08.279
<i>the chiru have embarked
on their journey back home</i>

33:08.404 --> 33:09.822
<i>to rejoin the males.</i>

33:12.283 --> 33:16.662
<i>But the smell of young calves
has attracted followers.</i>

33:31.010 --> 33:33.012
<i>This wolf tests the herd...</i>

33:33.179 --> 33:35.264
<i>trying to separate the little ones.</i>

33:38.351 --> 33:40.520
<i>By now, luckily, those baby legs...</i>

33:40.686 --> 33:43.022
<i>are strong and fast,
just like their mothers'.</i>

33:47.860 --> 33:49.487
<i>The chiru are united.</i>

33:49.654 --> 33:53.115
<i>The bonds between moms
and babies hold strong.</i>

33:53.282 --> 33:55.952
<i>Each calf glued to its mother's scent.</i>

34:04.835 --> 34:06.963
<i>The herd is many...</i>

34:08.297 --> 34:10.800
<i>but the herd is one.</i>

34:29.652 --> 34:31.654
<i>The sheer beauty of China...</i>

34:31.821 --> 34:35.366
<i>manifests itself
in so many different ways...</i>

34:35.533 --> 34:38.077
<i>in so many remote corners.</i>

34:41.664 --> 34:44.667
<i>It sometimes feels like another world.</i>

34:50.715 --> 34:52.550
<i>Under Dawa's nurturing...</i>

34:52.717 --> 34:56.094
<i>her cubs are growing into
two impressive young cats.</i>

34:58.347 --> 35:01.350
<i>And she's just had a successful hunt...</i>

35:01.517 --> 35:03.853
<i>which comes none too soon.</i>

35:04.353 --> 35:08.858
<i>Her cubs are now fully weaned
and hungry for some fresh meat.</i>

35:09.525 --> 35:13.529
<i>They've been watching and learning
the ways of the great hunter...</i>

35:14.864 --> 35:16.073
<i>their morn.</i>

35:16.616 --> 35:18.260
<i>But</i> suddenly...

35:18.284 --> 35:21.287
<i>across the valley,
the intruder has returned.</i>

35:21.954 --> 35:25.458
<i>This time, with her three grown sons.</i>

35:32.381 --> 35:35.885
<i>Scarcity of prey has brought them
into Dawa's territory...</i>

35:36.052 --> 35:40.222
<i>and they are more than prepared
to take all that is hers.</i>

35:46.395 --> 35:49.148
<i>Dawa's old rival is
much more emboldened...</i>

35:49.315 --> 35:51.275
<i>now that she has reinforcements.</i>

35:51.734 --> 35:53.986
<i>She and Dawa both know...</i>

35:54.153 --> 35:57.948
<i>Dawa would never survive a fight
against all four leopards.</i>

36:24.350 --> 36:27.687
<i>Dawa can't bring herself
to abandon this precious food, though.</i>

36:31.190 --> 36:35.611
<i>Her cubs must eat,
and when it comes to their survival...</i>

36:35.778 --> 36:37.947
<i>Dawa would fight almost any foe.</i>

36:44.286 --> 36:46.789
<i>The trade-off between life and death...</i>

36:46.956 --> 36:50.126
<i>is sometimes a very difficult calculation.</i>

37:08.060 --> 37:10.312
<i>But then the sons move in.</i>

37:19.488 --> 37:21.991
<i>Outnumbered and out-fanged...</i>

37:22.158 --> 37:25.411
<i>Dawa must retreat to guard her cubs.</i>

37:33.210 --> 37:36.505
<i>Not satisfied with merely
stealing Dawa's kill...</i>

37:36.672 --> 37:40.009
<i>the interlopers
now pursue her to let her know...</i>

37:40.176 --> 37:42.344
<i>they're here to stay.</i>

37:49.018 --> 37:50.686
<i>To save her young...</i>

37:50.853 --> 37:53.689
<i>Dawa must take them
and leave the area.</i>

38:13.292 --> 38:16.378
<i>Expelled from their own home.</i>

38:34.355 --> 38:37.733
<i>When your baby
is the cutest, fuzziest creature...</i>

38:37.900 --> 38:39.401
<i>this side of the Yangtze River...</i>

38:40.402 --> 38:44.156
<i>it's not easy to just leave it alone.</i>

39:03.926 --> 39:05.928
<i>At six months old, MeiMei is thinking...</i>

39:06.095 --> 39:08.764
<i>she's ready to move about on her own.</i>

39:10.391 --> 39:11.767
<i>Her mother is thinking...</i>

39:12.768 --> 39:14.520
<i>"Yeah, not so much."</i>

39:15.563 --> 39:17.231
<i>That's a tall tree.</i>

39:17.398 --> 39:20.067
<i>And MeiMei is no expert climber.</i>

39:20.568 --> 39:21.694
<i>Yet.</i>

39:36.917 --> 39:41.422
<i>"Come on! Mom! I just wanna... Argh!"</i>

39:48.387 --> 39:52.766
<i>Being a helicopter mom
can suffocate a cub's curiosity, though.</i>

39:52.933 --> 39:55.978
<i>For young pandas,
tree climbing is a rite of passage.</i>

39:56.812 --> 39:59.481
<i>When a cub is able to
successfully climb a tree...</i>

39:59.648 --> 40:02.151
<i>it means it can be safe from predators.</i>

40:04.278 --> 40:05.654
<i>A cub that can climb a tree...</i>

40:06.739 --> 40:09.783
<i>is a cub that no longer needs its mother.</i>

40:13.245 --> 40:16.248
<i>"Mom, relax. I got this."</i>

40:35.601 --> 40:36.852
<i>On the plains of Qinghai...</i>

40:37.353 --> 40:40.272
<i>the male chiru stand guard
on the home front...</i>

40:40.439 --> 40:43.943
<i>awaiting the return
of their far-roving females.</i>

40:55.621 --> 40:58.374
<i>The females have
traveled long and far...</i>

40:58.540 --> 41:00.960
<i>to be reunited with their partners.</i>

41:10.552 --> 41:11.637
<i>Unfortunately...</i>

41:11.887 --> 41:15.057
<i>after being away
from each other for so long...</i>

41:15.224 --> 41:18.018
<i>neither the males nor the females...</i>

41:18.185 --> 41:21.313
<i>have the slightest idea
who their partners are.</i>

41:22.898 --> 41:24.483
<i>But not to worry...</i>

41:25.818 --> 41:29.363
<i>the males are more than happy
to impress new females...</i>

41:29.530 --> 41:31.240
<i>and start new families.</i>

41:37.037 --> 41:39.999
<i>They've spent the entire spring
and summer bulking up...</i>

41:40.165 --> 41:42.751
<i>and vying with each other
for supremacy.</i>

41:42.918 --> 41:46.422
<i>And they're raring
to show off their masculinity.</i>

41:50.718 --> 41:52.928
<i>"Problems with wolves, ladies?"</i>

41:53.887 --> 41:56.598
<i>"Fear not. I'll deal with this scoundrel."</i>

42:03.022 --> 42:05.733
<i>One glance at that
imposing male physique...</i>

42:05.899 --> 42:09.403
<i>and this scrappy little predator
is soon sent on his way.</i>

42:09.570 --> 42:11.905
<i>"Hey!</i>

42:14.616 --> 42:16.035
<i>"It's all good."</i>

42:17.578 --> 42:19.913
<i>"The ice causes a bit of a... whoa!"</i>

42:41.477 --> 42:43.729
<i>Regardless of how they accomplish it...</i>

42:43.896 --> 42:48.776
<i>the herd always comes together again
as one great big family.</i>

42:50.569 --> 42:55.240
<i>And the never-ending tide
of chiru life flows on.</i>

43:08.128 --> 43:10.589
<i>As the temperatures begin to plummet...</i>

43:10.756 --> 43:13.342
<i>the once mighty
Queen of the Mountain...</i>

43:13.509 --> 43:16.178
<i>hasn't made a kill in over a week.</i>

43:16.512 --> 43:20.849
<i>Now, she's forced to share
her unfamiliar new territory...</i>

43:21.016 --> 43:23.352
<i>with more successful rivals.</i>

43:34.738 --> 43:36.990
<i>She must survey the area constantly...</i>

43:37.157 --> 43:40.869
<i>to get the lay of the land
and reestablish her dominion...</i>

43:41.036 --> 43:42.538
<i>with scent markings.</i>

43:45.207 --> 43:47.876
<i>But she's been spotted
by this area's male.</i>

44:02.057 --> 44:04.393
<i>She defends her ground bravely...</i>

44:04.560 --> 44:07.229
<i>but is forced to retreat back to her cubs.</i>

44:15.529 --> 44:17.531
<i>Those playful days of summer...</i>

44:17.698 --> 44:20.909
<i>seem very far away to Dawa right now.</i>

44:31.086 --> 44:35.465
<i>If only a family's love
could determine its fate.</i>

44:53.442 --> 44:56.570
<i>YaYa's instinct is to keep her cub safe.</i>

45:05.162 --> 45:08.081
<i>But she can't protect MeiMei forever.</i>

45:08.790 --> 45:10.250
<i>At some point...</i>

45:10.417 --> 45:12.502
<i>she's going to have to let go.</i>

45:23.889 --> 45:25.599
<i>Just... maybe not today.</i>

45:32.689 --> 45:35.359
<i>Winter turns the dense forest...</i>

45:35.525 --> 45:38.862
<i>into a majestic crystal fantasy land.</i>

45:41.865 --> 45:45.619
<i>This is the first snowfall
Tao Tao's sister has ever seen.</i>

45:46.703 --> 45:49.957
<i>Her pure amazement
is a welcome distraction...</i>

45:50.123 --> 45:52.000
<i>from the hardships of winter.</i>

45:54.044 --> 45:56.338
<i>"What is this stuff?"</i>

46:01.843 --> 46:04.805
<i>"Whatever it is, it's cold."</i>

46:06.181 --> 46:08.684
<i>"Must get to higher ground!"</i>

46:10.727 --> 46:12.688
<i>Yes, snow is a bummer...</i>

46:12.854 --> 46:15.565
<i>and it's really cold on your hands.</i>

46:15.732 --> 46:17.067
<i>The one upside is...</i>

46:17.234 --> 46:20.696
<i>it's a perfect excuse to walk like this.</i>

46:48.849 --> 46:50.684
<i>The cold and scarcity of winter...</i>

46:50.851 --> 46:54.021
<i>has brought the various groups
within the troop together again.</i>

46:54.896 --> 46:56.940
<i>They're so hungry...</i>

46:57.107 --> 46:58.567
<i>they'll eat anything.</i>

47:01.236 --> 47:04.906
<i>Rooster certainly
isn't giving Tao Tao any handouts.</i>

47:05.073 --> 47:06.533
<i>Or warmth.</i>

47:06.950 --> 47:08.702
<i>Or support.</i>

47:12.122 --> 47:13.457
<i>This is what you get...</i>

47:13.623 --> 47:15.792
<i>when you're hooked up
with the Lost Boys.</i>

47:21.590 --> 47:22.758
<i>Whoa!</i>

47:23.592 --> 47:25.427
<i>Rooster is scrapping over food again.</i>

47:30.932 --> 47:32.934
<i>And the hostility is spreading.</i>

47:35.562 --> 47:38.565
<i>Before you know it,
Tao Tao gets drawn into the fray.</i>

47:39.483 --> 47:41.943
<i>Even his little sister
gets caught up in it.</i>

47:44.988 --> 47:47.783
<i>She tries to help her brother
and stop them from fighting...</i>

47:47.949 --> 47:50.994
<i>but there's just
no reasoning with these animals.</i>

47:53.622 --> 47:56.666
<i>TaoTao's father
wants nothing to do with it.</i>

47:57.459 --> 48:00.420
<i>There's barely any food here
to fight over anyway.</i>

48:03.006 --> 48:05.133
<i>He packs up his family and heads off...</i>

48:05.300 --> 48:07.511
<i>to lower, warmer territory.</i>

48:11.848 --> 48:14.476
<i>With the cold biting at his bones...</i>

48:14.643 --> 48:17.604
<i>Tao Tao is longing for some comfort.</i>

48:17.771 --> 48:21.691
<i>For someone, anyone,
to just keep him warm.</i>

48:24.444 --> 48:26.488
<i>He misses his family.</i>

48:27.989 --> 48:30.867
<i>Up until now,
he's resisted going back to them.</i>

48:33.161 --> 48:35.664
<i>Maybe he's still bitter about his sister.</i>

48:36.665 --> 48:39.167
<i>Maybe he's trying to
prove something to his father.</i>

48:39.668 --> 48:40.877
<i>Who knows?</i>

48:44.005 --> 48:47.050
<i>Right now, he needs warmth.</i>

48:49.886 --> 48:52.055
<i>He abandons the Lost Boys...</i>

48:54.558 --> 48:56.977
<i>and follows his family.</i>

49:18.498 --> 49:20.709
<i>His sister welcomes him back.</i>

49:22.752 --> 49:25.422
<i>But life isn't always that simple.</i>

49:31.219 --> 49:33.388
<i>His father won't let him in.</i>

49:35.098 --> 49:37.726
<i>TaoTao has no one to turn to.</i>

49:43.106 --> 49:45.066
<i>He's run out of options.</i>

49:59.623 --> 50:01.583
<i>Between winter's wrath...</i>

50:01.750 --> 50:03.668
<i>and plain old bad luck...</i>

50:03.835 --> 50:07.589
<i>Dawa's hunting successes
have been few and far between.</i>

50:10.091 --> 50:12.928
<i>But these sheep,
seeking shelter from the weather...</i>

50:13.512 --> 50:16.139
<i>have just moved within range.</i>

51:03.853 --> 51:06.147
<i>Something terrible happens, though.</i>

51:15.991 --> 51:20.036
<i>The snow has concealed jagged rocks,
and Dawa has injured her paw.</i>

52:04.748 --> 52:09.252
<i>Dawa knows
if she and her cubs are to survive...</i>

52:09.419 --> 52:12.714
<i>she must be
in top physical condition to hunt.</i>

52:54.172 --> 52:56.132
<i>It looks like Tao Tao has finally...</i>

52:56.299 --> 52:59.427
<i>been allowed to rejoin the family furball.</i>

53:07.018 --> 53:10.355
<i>Or more like cling onto the outside of it.</i>

53:11.940 --> 53:14.943
<i>As long as he's willing to help
protect the family against the cold...</i>

53:15.694 --> 53:17.946
<i>his father will let him stay.</i>

53:19.197 --> 53:21.616
<i>It's better than freezing all alone.</i>

53:23.159 --> 53:26.454
<i>At least his little sister
looks happy to see him.</i>

53:28.998 --> 53:33.002
<i>Maybe Tao Tao is finally learning
the true value of family.</i>

53:35.672 --> 53:39.467
<i>Or maybe he's just really cold.</i>

54:21.760 --> 54:23.178
<i>In China...</i>

54:23.678 --> 54:26.055
<i>some believe the panda to be
the living embodiment...</i>

54:26.222 --> 54:28.099
<i>of the yin and yang concept...</i>

54:28.516 --> 54:31.352
<i>the curved black-and-white
patterns of its fur...</i>

54:31.519 --> 54:33.521
<i>mimicking the symbol itself.</i>

54:38.735 --> 54:42.739
<i>This duality of opposing forces
exists everywhere in nature.</i>

54:46.534 --> 54:48.870
<i>But perhaps nowhere more so...</i>

54:49.037 --> 54:53.041
<i>than in the mounting relationship
between Ya Ya and MeiMei.</i>

54:56.544 --> 55:00.048
<i>The push and pull between
freedom and protection...</i>

55:00.215 --> 55:02.217
<i>is coming to a head.</i>

55:06.095 --> 55:08.264
<i>Ya Ya wants so badly...</i>

55:08.431 --> 55:11.392
<i>to hold on to her precious daughter
and keep her safe.</i>

55:11.893 --> 55:14.938
<i>But MeiMei has an uncontrollable...</i>

55:15.104 --> 55:18.566
<i>evolutionary urge to just climb.</i>

55:22.612 --> 55:26.241
<i>And yeah, sure,
the kid has some issues with gravity.</i>

55:28.159 --> 55:30.787
<i>But so what? Life is risky.</i>

55:30.954 --> 55:33.081
<i>She's going to fall down.</i>

55:39.420 --> 55:41.840
<i>And then, she'll get back up.</i>

55:50.974 --> 55:54.519
<i>But at some point,
she has to do it on her own.</i>

56:01.609 --> 56:04.779
<i>And today is that day.</i>

56:16.666 --> 56:19.961
<i>As deep as YaYa's love
for her daughter is...</i>

56:21.296 --> 56:23.298
<i>there is a force that is stronger.</i>

56:23.464 --> 56:25.466
<i>A force of nature.</i>

56:30.513 --> 56:32.557
<i>And it's pulling them apart.</i>

56:48.740 --> 56:50.450
<i>She's going for it.</i>

57:40.208 --> 57:43.169
<i>The day you climb a tree on your own...</i>

57:44.545 --> 57:46.589
<i>without falling out of it...</i>

57:48.424 --> 57:50.718
<i>is a big day.</i>

58:04.691 --> 58:07.986
<i>Ya Ya may be</i>
a <i>slightly overprotective mother...</i>

58:09.070 --> 58:12.573
<i>but she's raised
one extraordinary little panda.</i>

58:16.703 --> 58:18.871
<i>She also knows...</i>

58:19.038 --> 58:21.374
<i>it will soon be time to say goodbye.</i>

58:26.546 --> 58:29.173
<i>The joy a mother receives...</i>

58:29.340 --> 58:32.093
<i>from raising a cub from birth, however...</i>

58:32.260 --> 58:35.263
<i>is worth a thousand farewells.</i>

58:50.319 --> 58:52.822
<i>Springtime means more food.</i>

58:58.077 --> 58:59.537
<i>More fleas.</i>

59:04.917 --> 59:06.502
<i>And more babies.</i>

59:12.383 --> 59:14.218
<i>Which, in turn, means...</i>

59:14.719 --> 59:16.679
<i>more baby fever.</i>

59:36.032 --> 59:39.827
<i>Though Tao Tao is getting along better
with his family lately...</i>

59:39.994 --> 59:43.706
<i>he's understandably been spending
less time around his father.</i>

59:45.124 --> 59:47.919
<i>And a lot more time by himself.</i>

59:54.050 --> 59:56.385
<i>Tao Tao's sister is growing up, too.</i>

01:00:01.307 --> 01:00:04.268
<i>She's starting to
show off her own personality.</i>

01:00:20.451 --> 01:00:23.496
<i>She's at an age now
where her mother can leave her alone...</i>

01:00:23.663 --> 01:00:25.414
<i>to go forage for food.</i>

01:00:27.125 --> 01:00:29.752
<i>Or for someone else's baby.</i>

01:00:34.924 --> 01:00:37.343
<i>But wherever there are little babies...</i>

01:00:38.427 --> 01:00:41.180
<i>goshawks are not far away.</i>

01:00:47.645 --> 01:00:50.022
<i>Tao Tao spots the predator
and sounds the alarm.</i>

01:00:52.400 --> 01:00:54.735
<i>The troop scrambles for cover.</i>

01:00:56.571 --> 01:00:58.156
<i>All little ones are accounted for.</i>

01:00:59.365 --> 01:01:01.784
<i>Except for one. Tao Tao's sister.</i>

01:01:05.788 --> 01:01:07.915
<i>But Tao Tao has been
keeping an eye on her...</i>

01:01:08.082 --> 01:01:09.917
<i>and leaps into action.</i>

01:01:19.427 --> 01:01:22.221
<i>He reaches her just in time.</i>

01:01:37.612 --> 01:01:40.531
<i>Tao Tao has never felt so valued.</i>

01:01:40.698 --> 01:01:44.535
<i>He acted on pure instinct
to protect his sister.</i>

01:01:44.702 --> 01:01:48.289
<i>And that brave act
has made him realize...</i>

01:01:48.789 --> 01:01:50.458
<i>that he's grown up.</i>

01:01:50.625 --> 01:01:51.626
<i>A lot.</i>

01:01:53.294 --> 01:01:57.048
<i>His dad is definitely happy
to have him back in the fold.</i>

01:02:00.218 --> 01:02:02.845
<i>The young outcast
without a care in the world...</i>

01:02:03.596 --> 01:02:06.849
<i>has grown up into the family hero.</i>

01:02:10.269 --> 01:02:13.564
<i>He's certainly a hero
in his sister's eyes.</i>

01:02:33.668 --> 01:02:35.753
<i>Back up on the high plateau...</i>

01:02:35.920 --> 01:02:39.215
<i>the winter snow
lingers well into spring...</i>

01:02:41.217 --> 01:02:44.845
<i>and Dawa is still fighting
to provide for her cubs.</i>

01:02:49.350 --> 01:02:50.768
<i>The injury to her foot</i>

01:02:50.851 --> 01:02:52.937
<i>has greatly hampered
her hunting ability...</i>

01:02:53.104 --> 01:02:56.190
<i>and she no longer has the speed
to chase down prey...</i>

01:02:56.357 --> 01:02:58.359
<i>as fast as these wild sheep.</i>

01:03:07.034 --> 01:03:09.245
<i>But an opportunity arises.</i>

01:03:11.539 --> 01:03:14.417
<i>In springtime,
domesticated yaks are released...</i>

01:03:14.583 --> 01:03:17.211
<i>to graze in the higher elevations.</i>

01:03:19.797 --> 01:03:22.800
<i>These beasts are
10 times as heavy as Dawa...</i>

01:03:23.634 --> 01:03:27.805
<i>and one blow from
those powerful horns could be fatal.</i>

01:03:30.808 --> 01:03:34.228
<i>Going up against
a whole herd is like attacking an army.</i>

01:03:36.564 --> 01:03:39.066
<i>But her cubs are relying on her.</i>

01:03:51.454 --> 01:03:53.956
<i>It's now or never.</i>

01:04:14.518 --> 01:04:17.271
<i>The calf's mother
rallies to save her baby.</i>

01:04:22.777 --> 01:04:24.987
<i>Dawa refuses to let go.</i>

01:04:25.488 --> 01:04:27.656
<i>She knows this is her last chance.</i>

01:04:35.122 --> 01:04:37.625
<i>But a yak mother's will
to protect her young...</i>

01:04:37.792 --> 01:04:39.627
<i>is just as strong as Dawa's.</i>

01:04:46.008 --> 01:04:49.470
<i>The yak strikes Dawa
hard with her horns.</i>

01:04:55.643 --> 01:04:57.395
<i>Dawa is injured badly.</i>

01:05:09.073 --> 01:05:11.992
<i>One mother's brave rescue
of her baby...</i>

01:05:13.911 --> 01:05:17.248
<i>is another's tragic failure to feed hers.</i>

01:07:24.792 --> 01:07:28.462
<i>In Chinese mythology,
when a life ends...</i>

01:07:29.171 --> 01:07:31.549
<i>a crane carries that soul...</i>

01:07:31.715 --> 01:07:35.302
<i>to rejoin the cycle of birth and rebirth.</i>

01:07:40.891 --> 01:07:44.019
<i>From the end to the beginning.</i>

01:07:51.569 --> 01:07:54.822
<i>Time pushes this cycle ever forward.</i>

01:07:59.577 --> 01:08:01.829
<i>The young become adults.</i>

01:08:03.539 --> 01:08:05.666
<i>The adults grow old.</i>

01:08:06.834 --> 01:08:10.087
<i>And the old are reborn.</i>

01:08:14.675 --> 01:08:17.176
<i>Death is not the end.</i>

01:08:18.178 --> 01:08:22.390
<i>It is merely a waypoint
in a circle that continues endlessly.</i>

01:09:48.102 --> 01:09:50.437
<i>Every creature plays its part...</i>

01:09:50.604 --> 01:09:53.607
<i>in this great cyclical symphony.</i>

01:09:57.778 --> 01:09:59.113
<i>Each life lived...</i>

01:09:59.279 --> 01:10:03.158
<i>is just one beat
in the larger beautiful rhythm.</i>

01:10:14.795 --> 01:10:19.550
<i>This vast land breeds
both love and hardship.</i>

01:10:20.801 --> 01:10:23.011
<i>But in the hardship...</i>

01:10:23.554 --> 01:10:25.347
<i>there is hope.</i>

01:10:34.648 --> 01:10:36.734
<i>This is where they live.</i>

01:10:44.658 --> 01:10:47.244
<i>This is where they die.</i>

01:10:54.251 --> 01:10:56.503
<i>This is where they grow.</i>

01:11:30.871 --> 01:11:34.208
<i>This is where they are born.</i>

01:11:37.211 --> 01:11:39.087
<i>In China.</i>

01:12:11.662 --> 01:12:14.998
We tried to take
some time-lapses of the landscape.

01:12:15.582 --> 01:12:17.668
As you might see right now...

01:12:17.835 --> 01:12:20.420
the light is not very interesting.

01:12:20.671 --> 01:12:23.048
But the good thing is...

01:12:23.215 --> 01:12:26.009
the weather is changing
every half an hour.

01:12:26.176 --> 01:12:28.720
So, if you don't like
the weather or the light...

01:12:28.887 --> 01:12:29.906
you just have to wait a little bit

01:12:29.930 --> 01:12:31.932
and everything changes again.

01:12:35.686 --> 01:12:38.063
Got a snow leopard
sneaking up on blue sheep.

01:12:38.230 --> 01:12:39.940
It doesn't get any better than this!

01:13:00.586 --> 01:13:02.546
Now it's hailing.

01:13:02.713 --> 01:13:06.466
Perhaps in half an hour,
it will be beautiful sunshine.

01:13:06.633 --> 01:13:09.261
So, it's just a waiting game.

01:14:01.188 --> 01:14:02.332
I'm done With it.

01:14:02.356 --> 01:14:03.583
Go ahead.

01:14:03.607 --> 01:14:04.667
Hello?

01:14:04.691 --> 01:14:05.692
Okay.

01:14:06.526 --> 01:14:08.862
He's looking at the monitor.

01:14:12.532 --> 01:14:14.576
Oh! The camera moves.

01:14:25.212 --> 01:14:27.047
Okay, it's, again,

01:14:27.172 --> 01:14:28.173
half an hour later.

01:14:28.715 --> 01:14:30.634
And now it's snowing.

01:14:30.801 --> 01:14:34.388
We have rolling mist
and a proper thunderstorm.

01:14:35.472 --> 01:14:39.184
But I'm still convinced that
if we wait another half an hour...

01:14:39.351 --> 01:14:42.646
we will have
best conditions for my time-lapse.

01:15:05.002 --> 01:15:07.421
It's really wonderful
getting so intimate...

01:15:07.587 --> 01:15:11.675
with the early family life
of such a rare and beautiful bird.
