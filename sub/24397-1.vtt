02:30.949 --> 02:32.185
Mama?

02:50.868 --> 02:51.704
Paul?

06:12.504 --> 06:15.505
He looks so much like Paul.

06:16.507 --> 06:18.377
He's falling asleep.

06:27.653 --> 06:28.718
Consuelo!

06:28.720 --> 06:30.454
Sh, don't wake him.

06:30.456 --> 06:31.086
Oh, sorry.

06:36.461 --> 06:37.726
And I propose a toast.

06:37.728 --> 06:38.961
Ah, good idea!

06:38.963 --> 06:41.832
To you Veronica, to your son,

06:41.834 --> 06:44.534
to your coming to New
York, and of course...

06:44.536 --> 06:46.135
To your future
success in America.

06:46.137 --> 06:50.807
Yes, but you
know everybody succeed in US.

06:50.809 --> 06:51.974
That's true.

06:51.976 --> 06:53.709
You just need to
set your mind to it.

06:53.711 --> 06:54.543
We'll see.

06:54.545 --> 06:55.812
No, no, it's true.

06:55.814 --> 06:57.546
Take Paul for example.

06:57.548 --> 07:00.216
When he came, he was just a
brilliant student and now...

07:01.153 --> 07:02.889
- Now!
- Look at him.

07:04.088 --> 07:06.889
But Veronica is
already successful.

07:06.891 --> 07:09.896
Ah, Veronica must
play at the Met.

07:11.230 --> 07:12.596
It would be such a
pleasure to see her there.

07:12.598 --> 07:13.997
Which, my dear,
you won't, since

07:13.999 --> 07:15.832
you're mostly
sleeping at concerts.

07:23.574 --> 07:26.843
Oh, Veronica, will you
play for us after dessert?

07:26.845 --> 07:28.577
Yes, with pleasure.

07:28.579 --> 07:32.582
Paul, so you
told me you needed a nanny?

07:32.584 --> 07:35.885
Because I can recommend a nanny
or a night nurse, or both.

07:35.887 --> 07:37.586
I think you should get both.

07:37.588 --> 07:39.522
A nanny for Veronica
and a night nurse for me?

07:45.029 --> 07:48.632
No, I'm a good hubby, and
we'll go for the nanny, right?

07:48.634 --> 07:50.634
I don't want a nanny.

07:50.636 --> 07:51.267
Why?

07:51.269 --> 07:53.269
I mean, why not?

07:53.271 --> 07:54.603
You do need a nanny.

07:54.605 --> 07:56.641
I'm fine, I don't really.

07:58.009 --> 08:00.075
I don't need any help.

08:00.077 --> 08:00.944
Don't be so tense.

08:00.946 --> 08:02.611
I'm not tense.

08:02.613 --> 08:05.014
Even the best
mother needs help, believe me.

08:05.016 --> 08:07.284
She doesn't realize
how tired she is.

08:07.286 --> 08:08.151
But I'm not tired.

08:08.153 --> 08:09.252
I'm fine.

08:09.254 --> 08:11.921
Personally, the night
nurse I hired for Mathieu

08:11.923 --> 08:16.091
when he was born, I was
so white, she was amazing.

08:16.093 --> 08:18.194
What they never say
is that breastfeeding

08:18.196 --> 08:20.663
drains you completely out.

08:20.665 --> 08:22.966
I'm totally fine!

08:22.968 --> 08:24.700
No, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no,

08:24.702 --> 08:26.202
I want you to stay
in good shape.

08:26.204 --> 08:29.072
In six months,
you'll look like a zombie.

08:29.074 --> 08:30.307
You need to stay
in good shape.

08:30.309 --> 08:32.241
Adele, send me the info
for the night nurse.

08:32.244 --> 08:33.078
Okay.

08:50.596 --> 08:53.662
And, the cleaning lady
story, tell me about this.

08:53.664 --> 08:54.664
You had to fire her.

08:54.666 --> 08:55.931
Did you find another one?

08:55.933 --> 08:57.736
Veronica actually...

08:59.203 --> 09:02.238
She takes care of
everything at home.

09:02.240 --> 09:03.075
What?

09:04.241 --> 09:07.810
I have time while
Keoshka's asleep.

09:07.812 --> 09:10.347
No, what I mean
is that you need

09:10.349 --> 09:12.949
some time to play the piano.

09:12.951 --> 09:13.949
No, no, no, she plays.

09:13.951 --> 09:15.153
I don't play.

09:17.389 --> 09:18.854
I play.

09:18.856 --> 09:20.690
It's just for now
because he sleeps

09:20.692 --> 09:23.826
a lot so it's too
loud for him and...

09:23.828 --> 09:26.765
Yeah, she
plays lullabies.

09:28.833 --> 09:30.967
You really
clean everything?

09:30.969 --> 09:32.901
They have three bathrooms!

09:32.903 --> 09:35.104
See, two and a half.

09:39.410 --> 09:41.613
« Speaking French »

09:49.020 --> 09:49.921
Bye.

10:39.437 --> 10:40.236
Cherie?

10:40.238 --> 10:41.070
Mm-hm.

10:58.956 --> 11:00.956
What time is it?

11:00.958 --> 11:02.358
It's eight.

11:02.360 --> 11:04.060
I have to go to work.

11:04.062 --> 11:05.060
Take him out today.

11:05.062 --> 11:06.496
It's warm.

11:06.498 --> 11:08.464
Oh yeah, the light changed.

11:08.466 --> 11:11.800
Maybe spring is here finally.

11:11.802 --> 11:13.203
I know spring's
here when women

11:13.205 --> 11:14.337
stop wearing black stockings.

11:16.942 --> 11:17.743
Sh.

11:19.977 --> 11:21.945
Okay, I'm going.

15:52.683 --> 15:54.517
Paul, can you please
remember to not leave

15:54.519 --> 15:57.085
the wet towel and the curtain?

15:57.087 --> 16:01.391
The curtain molds and the
towel gets a bad smell.

16:08.767 --> 16:11.099
Is it good, buddy?

16:17.509 --> 16:19.979
I'll call you tonight, bye.

16:25.716 --> 16:27.150
Listen, you really
have to make an effort

16:27.152 --> 16:29.252
to learn and speak
French to him.

16:29.254 --> 16:31.253
He got enough Russian.

16:31.255 --> 16:32.655
I think Adele has a point.

16:32.657 --> 16:35.293
A French au pair is a good idea.

16:36.427 --> 16:37.826
We don't even have
to pay her that much.

16:37.828 --> 16:39.561
We could have her live with us.

16:39.563 --> 16:41.397
She could take the piano room.

16:41.399 --> 16:44.666
The piano room, what
if I want to play?

16:44.668 --> 16:46.069
Yeah, but
you don't play.

16:46.071 --> 16:47.206
You don't, so...

16:49.474 --> 16:53.408
And by the way, how about giving
piano lessons for a while?

16:53.410 --> 16:54.810
I don't know.

16:54.812 --> 16:57.412
I don't feel like teaching.

16:57.414 --> 17:00.583
So teaching is not good
enough for Miss Orlova?

17:00.585 --> 17:02.084
I can't leave him yet.

17:02.086 --> 17:03.419
He needs me.

17:03.421 --> 17:04.820
I think it's about time.

18:05.782 --> 18:08.817
Sorry,
I need to speak English

18:08.819 --> 18:12.755
because Veronica's French
isn't good enough yet.

18:12.757 --> 18:17.526
This is Amanda, my childhood
friend, and also the famous

18:17.528 --> 18:21.363
singer and pianist,
Amanda De Lavilaret.

18:21.365 --> 18:23.365
It's a nobility name.

18:23.367 --> 18:26.902
Oh, yes, well, we all
know that Napoleon created

18:26.904 --> 18:29.238
so many nobility titles,
it's impossible to sort

18:29.240 --> 18:31.841
through anything in the
French aristocracy these days.

18:31.843 --> 18:35.678
Oh, by the way, Amanda,
this is Veronica Orlova.

18:35.680 --> 18:37.947
She used to be a concert
pianist like you.

18:37.949 --> 18:39.915
Orlova, Veronica
Orlova the pianist?

18:39.917 --> 18:40.816
Yes.

18:40.818 --> 18:43.251
It's
so good to meet you.

18:43.253 --> 18:45.787
You were my idol when I was
learning how to play the piano.

18:45.789 --> 18:47.957
We've been to at least
five of your concerts.

18:47.959 --> 18:49.959
The last was in London.

18:49.961 --> 18:51.393
What was it, 2008?

18:51.395 --> 18:53.528
Yes, that was one
of the last concerts.

18:53.530 --> 18:56.265
It was right before I came here.

18:56.267 --> 18:57.933
Well, not everybody
forgot me then!

18:58.936 --> 18:59.870
Of course not!

18:59.872 --> 19:02.738
Oh my goodness, it's
so good to see you,

19:02.740 --> 19:04.940
but you don't play anymore?

19:04.942 --> 19:07.276
I decided to take
care of my son.

19:07.278 --> 19:08.944
Children are so
wonderful, aren't they?

19:08.946 --> 19:10.580
You have children?

19:10.582 --> 19:12.681
Me?

19:12.683 --> 19:13.484
No.

19:14.885 --> 19:16.952
You read so many articles
about women performers

19:16.954 --> 19:19.322
balancing motherhood
and a career,

19:19.324 --> 19:23.562
it's just such a joke,
balancing!

19:25.296 --> 19:27.963
I mean, not that I'm
talking about you.

19:27.965 --> 19:31.700
No, as long as Veronica
and Keoshka are happy.

19:31.702 --> 19:35.004
Well, I know I couldn't
be happy if I couldn't play.

19:35.006 --> 19:36.572
I was having a conversation

19:36.574 --> 19:37.773
with Arnold Dieser
the other day.

19:37.775 --> 19:41.911
He's a famous music critic, and
if he likes my next concert,

19:41.913 --> 19:43.746
my career could go
to a whole new level,

19:43.748 --> 19:46.184
yeah, like the level you had.

19:49.253 --> 19:51.653
Amanda, maybe you
could arrange something?

19:51.655 --> 19:53.989
Uh-huh, that's
an excellent idea.

19:53.991 --> 19:55.124
Could you do it?

19:55.126 --> 19:59.664
Of course, but even though
Veronica isn't playing.

20:00.798 --> 20:02.664
That's the perfect
occasion to start again!

20:02.666 --> 20:03.865
Well, it will take some time

20:03.867 --> 20:06.635
before I can get back to the
level that I used to be at.

20:06.637 --> 20:08.938
Plus, Keoshka is
still very small.

20:08.940 --> 20:09.905
Small?

20:09.907 --> 20:13.342
In France, every kid his
age is going to school

20:13.344 --> 20:17.345
from nine to five and nobody
thinks twice about it.

20:17.347 --> 20:21.485
You've become so American, all
this fuss about motherhood.

20:24.689 --> 20:27.793
Anyone
wants a digestive?

20:29.794 --> 20:30.629
Paul?

20:37.769 --> 20:39.067
I will do the coffee.

20:39.069 --> 20:40.304
We'll be back in two minutes.

23:59.703 --> 24:00.568
Hello?

24:00.570 --> 24:01.572
Yeah.

24:02.240 --> 24:04.239
Of course, we...

24:04.241 --> 24:07.242
Paul, how many times
do I have to tell you!

24:07.244 --> 24:09.580
The curtain, the towel!

24:12.583 --> 24:13.718
It molds if not.

24:15.019 --> 24:16.151
No, no,
absolutely, you're right.

24:16.153 --> 24:17.151
You're right.

24:17.153 --> 24:17.788
I just...

24:19.123 --> 24:21.123
All I know is we need to look at

24:21.125 --> 24:24.727
the numbers again, and
then we'll figure it out.

24:24.729 --> 24:26.594
Yeah, but you keep
saying the same thing.

24:26.596 --> 24:28.130
There's nothing I can
do until I get there,

24:28.132 --> 24:30.732
so the sooner I get off the
phone, the sooner I get there.

24:30.734 --> 24:32.767
No, I'm not yelling!

24:32.769 --> 24:36.942
Okay, yeah, sure, okay, I'll
be there as soon as I can.

24:38.075 --> 24:40.875
I'm sure we'll
figure it out, okay?

24:40.877 --> 24:41.745
Okay.

24:49.787 --> 24:51.019
You know, I've been thinking.

24:51.021 --> 24:52.220
I really like Amanda.

24:52.222 --> 24:55.224
I think we might
become good friends.

24:55.226 --> 24:57.293
Have you seen my keys?

24:57.295 --> 25:01.666
No.

25:05.303 --> 25:06.634
My keys, where are my keys?

25:06.636 --> 25:07.635
I don't know.

25:07.637 --> 25:09.203
Is something wrong?

25:09.205 --> 25:11.775
Nothing, I just need my keys.

25:12.910 --> 25:15.678
Why don't you, can you...

25:15.680 --> 25:17.912
Tell me what's wrong.

25:17.914 --> 25:20.048
Nothing, it's
something at the bank.

25:20.050 --> 25:20.982
I just need to go.

25:20.984 --> 25:22.520
Where are my keys?

25:27.057 --> 25:28.324
Got them, okay!

25:28.326 --> 25:30.359
Cherie, cherie, I
have to go, okay?

25:31.828 --> 25:33.929
I see you tonight.

26:57.748 --> 26:59.183
No, it's wrong.

27:03.287 --> 27:05.023
She should be more...

27:09.693 --> 27:12.294
The pose should be changed.

27:12.296 --> 27:15.033
Cherie, can you
stand up, please?

27:24.709 --> 27:27.912
Your right arm,
higher please, higher.

27:32.215 --> 27:33.050
Yeah.

27:35.653 --> 27:39.691
Your hair, can you put your
hair in the back, please?

27:42.460 --> 27:46.862
And try to look through
the window over there.

27:49.066 --> 27:49.867
Okay.

27:58.108 --> 28:00.342
No, it's wrong, doesn't work.

28:00.344 --> 28:01.309
The pose should be changed.

28:01.311 --> 28:02.811
We should get back
to the previous pose.

28:02.813 --> 28:03.746
No, no, it doesn't work.

28:03.748 --> 28:04.947
It doesn't work.

28:04.949 --> 28:07.719
How about you
sketch me like this!

28:37.515 --> 28:39.782
It's Paul and Veronica.

28:39.784 --> 28:40.982
Go call the elevator for them.

28:40.984 --> 28:41.683
Let them wait.

28:41.685 --> 28:43.919
They're with Keoshka.

28:43.921 --> 28:46.854
Keoshka should not
touch the sculptures.

28:46.856 --> 28:48.856
The sculptures?

28:48.858 --> 28:50.258
What, when we have
a child, will he

28:50.260 --> 28:54.328
not be able to touch
the sculptures either?

28:54.330 --> 28:55.432
What child?

28:57.801 --> 29:01.202
I don't know what
you're talking about.

29:01.204 --> 29:02.904
Don't worry about Keoshka.

29:02.906 --> 29:04.573
Veronica's a good mother.

29:04.575 --> 29:06.275
I thought you
took her for a fool.

29:06.277 --> 29:09.010
Yeah, she doesn't fit
in, but is that her fault?

29:09.012 --> 29:13.050
When you don't feel it,
it's always your fault.

29:18.221 --> 29:19.453
You can pack your thing.

29:19.455 --> 29:20.889
That's it?

29:20.891 --> 29:21.590
Thank you.

30:14.077 --> 30:15.009
Mom?

30:36.267 --> 30:37.101
Mom.

30:56.185 --> 30:57.020
Allo?

30:59.455 --> 31:00.421
Yeah, yeah, I know.

31:00.423 --> 31:01.256
I know.

31:01.258 --> 31:02.125
What time?

31:04.295 --> 31:07.528
Okay, what's the
name of the place?

31:07.530 --> 31:08.532
Where is it?

31:09.432 --> 31:10.399
Got it, okay.

31:10.401 --> 31:13.004
Well, I'll come with Keoshka.

31:14.003 --> 31:15.036
What do you mean, "I
shouldn't bring him?"

31:15.038 --> 31:17.442
Where am I going to live him?

31:18.675 --> 31:19.674
What are you talking about?

31:19.676 --> 31:20.508
It's okay, I'll bring him.

31:20.510 --> 31:22.276
If he is tired,
I'll just go back.

31:22.278 --> 31:24.046
It's not a big deal.

31:24.048 --> 31:26.280
Look, I don't care that your
friends don't bring children.

31:26.282 --> 31:27.951
It's not my fault.

31:31.454 --> 31:32.421
What poet?

31:32.423 --> 31:33.290
So what?

31:36.693 --> 31:38.293
What?

31:38.295 --> 31:39.494
Why did you do that?

31:39.496 --> 31:40.728
Why didn't you tell me?

31:40.730 --> 31:43.699
No, look, he cries every
time I leave, okay?

31:43.701 --> 31:45.633
And, no, I'm not going.

31:45.635 --> 31:47.736
Either I'm going with
him or I'm not coming!

31:47.738 --> 31:48.703
I don't care!

31:48.705 --> 31:50.205
You can't decide things
like that without me!

31:50.207 --> 31:51.042
Okay, bye!

31:52.710 --> 31:54.442
Mom?

31:54.444 --> 31:55.312
Mom?

32:20.269 --> 32:21.105
Allo.

32:27.678 --> 32:31.015
Okay, I'll try.

32:33.150 --> 32:35.017
I know it's not far.

32:35.019 --> 32:36.621
When is she coming?

32:39.490 --> 32:41.023
In 30 minutes?

32:41.025 --> 32:42.123
You're kidding,
I have to change!

32:42.125 --> 32:43.624
I have to make him
something to eat!

32:43.626 --> 32:46.694
Why couldn't you, why didn't
you just, okay, whatever, bye.

32:46.696 --> 32:48.532
I'm going to run, bye!

33:08.451 --> 33:09.651
- Hi.
- Hi!

33:09.653 --> 33:10.454
Come in.

33:12.522 --> 33:13.321
I'm Veronica.

33:13.323 --> 33:15.056
I'm Bouz.

33:15.058 --> 33:16.190
Bouz?

33:16.192 --> 33:18.392
Yeah, you can
pronounce it like mouse.

33:18.394 --> 33:19.326
It's Turkish.

33:19.328 --> 33:21.796
Oh, okay, that's Keoshka.

33:21.798 --> 33:24.132
Hi, Keoshka!

33:24.134 --> 33:26.567
Let me take your
purse, just...

33:26.569 --> 33:27.803
Thank you.

33:27.805 --> 33:30.538
There, you can
keep your shoes on.

33:30.540 --> 33:33.744
I'll show you the
diapers and the food.

33:35.846 --> 33:37.746
Do you have any
experience with toddlers?

33:37.748 --> 33:39.815
Yes, a bit, yeah.

33:39.817 --> 33:43.287
Okay, at sleeping
time, around eight,

33:44.454 --> 33:47.154
he likes some songs,
like classic tunes.

33:47.156 --> 33:48.355
You can sing him something.

33:48.357 --> 33:50.191
Do you know any?

33:50.193 --> 33:53.563
I know This Is The
Kit or The Killers.

33:54.565 --> 33:55.600
No, Coldplay?

33:56.467 --> 33:57.565
Oh, I don't know these.

33:57.567 --> 33:59.167
Yeah, you know.

33:59.169 --> 34:02.837
♪ Come up to meet you,
tell you I'm sorry ♪

34:02.839 --> 34:07.177
♪ Don't know how
lovely you are ♪

34:08.512 --> 34:10.478
Maybe I should go now
because he's playing

34:10.481 --> 34:12.880
and so I just leave discretely.

34:12.882 --> 34:14.583
He doesn't...

34:14.585 --> 34:18.719
No, no, no, no, you should
tell him that you're leaving.

34:18.722 --> 34:20.188
No, that will be a drama.

34:20.190 --> 34:21.192
He will...

34:22.860 --> 34:25.391
Still, you should
tell him that you leave.

34:25.393 --> 34:27.594
It's really important.

34:27.597 --> 34:28.597
He'll cry.

34:28.599 --> 34:29.764
I've never left him.

34:29.766 --> 34:31.101
He'll be scared.

34:33.469 --> 34:35.672
Okay, it's gonna be fine.

34:39.208 --> 34:43.344
Look, he will cry and
I won't be able to leave.

34:43.347 --> 34:45.514
How about you just go
and I'll pay you anyway?

34:45.516 --> 34:46.815
I don't even want
to go anywhere.

34:46.817 --> 34:47.882
It's okay.

34:47.885 --> 34:50.284
No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no,

34:50.286 --> 34:53.690
he'll be fine, and
you will be fine, too.

34:59.896 --> 35:01.530
Okay.

35:01.532 --> 35:05.369
Now, you tell him
you're leaving and you go.

35:06.936 --> 35:08.505
And you'll be fine.

35:12.775 --> 35:13.909
Mama?

35:53.550 --> 35:57.686
Everyone, let me
introduce you to Denis.

35:57.688 --> 36:00.621
- He's a young Canadian poet.
- Hi.

36:00.623 --> 36:02.224
He's here for the weekend.

36:02.226 --> 36:04.626
Jacques found him at
the literary forum.

36:04.628 --> 36:08.733
He's my gift for
tonight.

36:28.719 --> 36:32.889
John Donne.

36:54.610 --> 36:56.510
And you, Veronica,
Paul tells me

36:56.512 --> 36:59.414
that you're from
a provincial city.

36:59.416 --> 37:01.383
Do you have an
accent in Russian?

37:01.385 --> 37:02.016
Of course not!

37:02.018 --> 37:03.351
I don't know.

37:03.353 --> 37:05.353
No, you don't have an accent.

37:05.355 --> 37:06.787
I guess not.

37:06.789 --> 37:11.358
Paul, didn't you tell me
that Veronica was from Moscow?

37:11.360 --> 37:15.298
Yeah, I mean, yeah,
I mean, Moscow not far, yeah.

37:16.699 --> 37:20.367
No, actually pretty
far, I went to conservatory

37:20.369 --> 37:24.072
in Moscow, but I was born
and raised in Belarus.

37:24.074 --> 37:25.507
Where is that?

37:25.509 --> 37:27.641
Minsk
is the capital.

37:27.643 --> 37:29.376
It's between Poland and Russia.

37:29.378 --> 37:32.646
Minsk, Moscow,
same difference.

37:32.648 --> 37:34.548
Like a Serbian
doorman says, you are

37:34.550 --> 37:37.318
from where your
children are born.

37:37.320 --> 37:39.954
And how was
growing up in Minsk?

37:39.956 --> 37:43.325
I wasn't exactly in Minsk,
more like around suburbs.

37:43.327 --> 37:45.263
Minsk suburbs, you'd say.

37:50.400 --> 37:52.534
And I was saying
to Jacques that you

37:52.536 --> 37:55.005
grew up with the Moscow elite!

37:56.405 --> 37:58.405
Yeah, that and
dancing in circles

37:58.407 --> 38:02.413
around Red Square with
polar bears and oil barons?

38:05.981 --> 38:07.081
Should we get more Champagne?

38:07.083 --> 38:08.950
- Oh, yes.
- Yes, sure.

38:08.952 --> 38:11.422
Oh, by the way, did you hear

38:12.822 --> 38:15.326
any news from Arnold Dieser?

38:16.760 --> 38:18.592
Arnold, yeah,
I told him about Veronica,

38:18.594 --> 38:21.829
but he just couldn't
remember who she was.

38:21.831 --> 38:23.465
No, I meant for you.

38:23.467 --> 38:25.367
He was gonna write an
article or something.

38:25.369 --> 38:26.235
He's waiting for my

38:26.237 --> 38:29.137
concert at Lincoln
Center next week.

38:29.139 --> 38:30.104
Did you get the tickets?

38:30.106 --> 38:32.507
I think so, did
we get these tickets?

38:32.509 --> 38:33.510
Excuse me.

38:35.445 --> 38:36.847
Very well, madam.

38:41.851 --> 38:45.586
"No man is an island
entire of itself.

38:45.588 --> 38:48.391
"Each is a piece
of the continent,

38:50.159 --> 38:51.525
"a part of the main.

38:54.164 --> 38:58.336
"If a clod be washed away by
the sea, Europe is the less.

38:59.802 --> 39:02.670
"Each man's death diminishes me

39:02.672 --> 39:05.342
"for I am involved in mankind.

39:06.543 --> 39:10.614
"Therefore, send not to know
for whom the bell tolls.

39:12.047 --> 39:14.481
"It tolls for thee."

39:18.554 --> 39:20.557
This Denis, this poet.

39:22.159 --> 39:26.063
When I think that Jacques
paid for him to come.

39:32.501 --> 39:33.601
Don't mind Amanda.

39:33.603 --> 39:36.637
You know, she's just
surprised by your birthplace.

39:36.639 --> 39:38.440
That's all.

39:38.442 --> 39:40.175
I don't understand
what you mean.

39:40.177 --> 39:43.177
Well, you know, if
you google Amanda,

39:43.179 --> 39:47.518
you'll see that she comes from
a long line of famous people.

39:48.585 --> 39:51.084
But, anyway, that's in the past.

39:51.086 --> 39:54.458
What's important is
what she does now.

39:55.692 --> 40:00.061
Because, in this country, what
you do defines who you are.

40:00.063 --> 40:01.528
That's why I don't
understand why

40:01.530 --> 40:03.664
you gave up the
piano to be at home.

40:03.666 --> 40:05.532
I'm raising my child.

40:05.534 --> 40:06.867
To me, it's a lot.

40:06.869 --> 40:08.670
I mean, any woman
can raise a child,

40:08.672 --> 40:12.474
but not any woman can play
the piano like you do.

40:12.476 --> 40:15.543
Keoshka is not
any woman's child.

40:15.545 --> 40:16.211
He's mine.

40:16.213 --> 40:17.211
He needs me.

40:17.213 --> 40:19.613
No, he needs someone.

40:19.615 --> 40:22.217
Anybody qualified will do.

40:22.219 --> 40:26.490
When Mathieu was two, I
only saw him once a week.

40:27.858 --> 40:29.090
I didn't step down.

40:29.092 --> 40:31.561
You're satisfied with that?

40:32.963 --> 40:35.496
I had to do it, otherwise
I would have lost my job!

40:35.498 --> 40:37.565
But do you think
you made the right choice?

40:37.567 --> 40:41.704
And you, you think you're
making the right choice?

40:44.106 --> 40:45.773
I'm just trying to help you!

40:45.775 --> 40:47.108
You will regret it someday.

40:47.110 --> 40:49.142
You can't sacrifice
your career like that!

40:49.144 --> 40:52.514
I am not sacrificing anything.

40:52.516 --> 40:55.119
There is no
sacrifice, understand?

44:22.791 --> 44:24.193
Veronica?

44:25.228 --> 44:26.230
Oh, Denis!

44:27.463 --> 44:29.099
Hi, what a surprise!

44:32.367 --> 44:33.467
Did you go to the concert?

44:33.469 --> 44:34.869
Concert?

44:34.871 --> 44:37.405
No, I just happen to
have my hotel nearby.

44:37.407 --> 44:38.940
Are you leaving?

44:38.942 --> 44:41.943
Yeah, I have to
go back to my son.

44:41.945 --> 44:43.845
No time for a drink?

44:43.847 --> 44:47.215
I invite you, and
this time, no poetry.

44:47.217 --> 44:50.383
I have to go back.

44:50.385 --> 44:51.485
It's late.

44:51.487 --> 44:55.088
I've been trying to get
a cab but no luck so far.

44:55.090 --> 44:57.827
Yeah, you require invention.

44:59.161 --> 45:00.697
Let me show you.

45:07.237 --> 45:08.101
Taxi!

45:12.242 --> 45:13.043
Hello!

45:21.251 --> 45:22.119
Taxi!

45:23.786 --> 45:24.721
Hey-o, hey-o!

45:30.260 --> 45:31.762
Well, thank you.

45:49.945 --> 45:52.412
I hope I see you
at Adele's parties.

45:52.414 --> 45:53.548
I think I'm probably banished

45:53.550 --> 45:56.420
forever from that royal kingdom.

45:57.887 --> 46:01.054
But we can meet somewhere else?

46:01.056 --> 46:04.559
We could see each other
in a pleasant place?

46:04.561 --> 46:06.296
Wait, take my number.

46:11.900 --> 46:15.438
Please, call me if you
want or if you need

46:16.905 --> 46:19.840
or much better, for no reasons.

46:19.842 --> 46:22.175
I'm leaving for
Montreal tomorrow.

46:22.177 --> 46:25.947
I'd take the first
plane back if you call.

46:25.949 --> 46:27.951
Good night.

47:39.422 --> 47:41.655
What are you doing here?

47:41.657 --> 47:43.023
I was worried.

47:43.025 --> 47:46.193
You weren't answering
my messages.

47:46.195 --> 47:47.662
Worried about what?

47:47.664 --> 47:49.429
What can you possibly
be worried about?

47:49.431 --> 47:51.331
I don't know.

47:51.333 --> 47:52.666
I couldn't enjoy the concert.

47:52.668 --> 47:55.135
I wanted to know how
things were here.

47:55.137 --> 47:56.003
Things are fine.

47:56.005 --> 47:57.137
How can things be?

47:57.139 --> 47:58.072
Keoshka's asleep.

47:58.074 --> 47:58.706
I'm here.

47:58.708 --> 48:01.041
Everything is fine!

48:01.043 --> 48:02.409
Sh, don't shout.

48:02.411 --> 48:04.045
You'll wake him up.

48:04.047 --> 48:04.882
Oh.

48:11.554 --> 48:15.690
So now you spoiled your
evening and mine, brilliant.

48:15.692 --> 48:18.561
What did I spoil,
your drinking?

48:21.297 --> 48:24.432
Anyway, Amanda didn't come.

48:24.434 --> 48:26.103
I'm not surprised.

48:28.704 --> 48:33.574
Why would she want to spend
any time with the mother?

48:33.576 --> 48:37.445
The mother!

48:37.447 --> 48:38.248
Stop it!

48:39.181 --> 48:40.715
The mother.

48:40.717 --> 48:42.450
Stop it, I said.

48:42.452 --> 48:46.720
Keoshka, Keoshka, Keoshka,
I have needs too, you know!

48:46.722 --> 48:47.521
What needs?

48:47.523 --> 48:48.356
What do you have?

48:48.358 --> 48:50.758
What needs?

48:50.760 --> 48:51.929
What needs?

48:55.998 --> 48:57.067
I need a woman.

48:59.402 --> 49:01.501
Miss Orlova, the great pianist.

49:01.503 --> 49:02.336
Stop it.

49:02.338 --> 49:03.269
Come on!

49:03.271 --> 49:04.472
Honey, you're disgusting.

49:04.474 --> 49:05.773
- You smell like wine!
- Just a mother.

49:05.775 --> 49:06.606
Be a wife!

49:06.608 --> 49:07.474
I said stop it!

49:07.476 --> 49:08.409
- Stop!
- Why?

49:24.360 --> 49:25.228
A mother.

50:42.338 --> 50:43.606
Ma!

52:01.284 --> 52:02.184
Jacques!

52:03.786 --> 52:04.588
Jacques!

52:10.927 --> 52:13.663
I don't want to
hear bitchy talks.

52:51.701 --> 52:52.568
Adele.

53:21.530 --> 53:22.365
Okay.

54:49.818 --> 54:51.288
Mommy!

55:43.139 --> 55:45.342
Didn't hear you come in.

55:53.949 --> 55:55.485
I'm exhausted.

55:57.186 --> 55:59.823
I can't take jet lag anymore.

56:04.693 --> 56:06.492
How are things here?

56:06.494 --> 56:07.427
Where is Keoshka?

56:07.429 --> 56:10.833
He's playing with
the neighbors' boy.

56:12.067 --> 56:13.499
What happened?

56:13.501 --> 56:15.436
I have burned myself.

56:15.438 --> 56:17.771
- Is it bad?
- No, just...

56:17.773 --> 56:18.972
Can I see?

56:18.974 --> 56:20.807
No, no, no, the
doctor said to keep

56:20.809 --> 56:24.510
the bandage on for
just a couple days.

56:24.512 --> 56:25.646
You went to see the doctor?

56:25.648 --> 56:26.646
Mm-hm.

56:26.648 --> 56:28.449
Then it's really bad.

56:28.451 --> 56:32.454
It's not that bad.

56:33.588 --> 56:36.690
Why do things like
that only happen to you?

56:36.692 --> 56:38.224
Why do you have
to cook and clean

56:38.226 --> 56:40.730
and do things with your hands?

56:43.465 --> 56:44.530
What?

56:44.532 --> 56:45.465
Wait!

56:45.467 --> 56:47.670
Please, please, I'm tired!

56:51.806 --> 56:53.706
Will it leave a scar?

56:53.708 --> 56:54.943
I don't know.

56:56.545 --> 56:58.414
I love your hands.

56:59.215 --> 57:00.613
They used to be
so beautiful when

57:00.615 --> 57:02.682
you played the piano, you know?

57:02.684 --> 57:03.383
So they were only

57:03.385 --> 57:05.686
beautiful when I played piano?

57:05.688 --> 57:09.822
Or do you want to know
if I can play again?

57:09.824 --> 57:10.692
What is it?

57:20.034 --> 57:22.503
How did it happen anyway?

57:22.505 --> 57:25.037
I was cooking and then
Keoshka called me and...

57:25.039 --> 57:29.041
Of course, I should
have guessed, Keoshka.

57:29.043 --> 57:30.276
Keoshka is calling you.

57:30.278 --> 57:31.244
As a good Russian
woman, you have

57:31.246 --> 57:33.246
to go into the burning house.

57:33.248 --> 57:34.983
I've heard it before.

57:38.521 --> 57:40.920
Anyway, it's better you burn
yourself now than later.

57:40.922 --> 57:44.460
At least we still
have health insurance.

57:45.260 --> 57:46.526
That makes me
feel much better.

57:46.528 --> 57:47.597
Thank you.

57:52.534 --> 57:54.034
Can we try not to fight?

57:54.036 --> 57:55.472
I just came back.

58:08.617 --> 58:10.053
Is this a new shirt?

58:12.554 --> 58:15.621
You know, in Singapore,
I had to get up

58:15.623 --> 58:19.559
at three in the morning, go the
gym 'cause I couldn't sleep.

58:19.561 --> 58:24.231
And so I would exercise for
like an hour, go back to bed.

58:24.233 --> 58:27.166
You know what the gym
looks like at 3:00 a.m.?

58:27.168 --> 58:28.504
It's depressing.

58:32.041 --> 58:35.909
It's getting
worse at the bank.

58:35.911 --> 58:37.046
I don't know.

58:40.315 --> 58:43.083
I wish I could just stay
home doing nothing like you.

58:43.085 --> 58:45.088
I'm not doing nothing!

58:46.188 --> 58:48.921
How is the job search going?

58:48.923 --> 58:52.959
I've been looking, but
got some small offers

58:52.961 --> 58:55.929
in conservatories
that are too far

58:55.931 --> 58:57.930
from here, too long of a ride.

58:57.932 --> 58:59.599
How far?

58:59.601 --> 59:01.068
Philadelphia...

59:01.070 --> 59:02.202
Americans commute, you know.

59:02.204 --> 59:03.670
It's common.

59:03.672 --> 59:06.072
Four hours of commute
every day is normal.

59:06.074 --> 59:09.976
Look at me with my 10 hours
flights back and forth.

59:09.978 --> 59:12.612
I just think you're too picky.

59:12.614 --> 59:15.615
That's what my
mom said, days ago.

59:15.617 --> 59:18.351
For once, I agree with her.

59:18.353 --> 59:20.387
Why can't you get a
position, any position?

59:20.389 --> 59:24.090
It doesn't matter,
just get a job.

59:24.092 --> 59:24.893
No?

59:26.762 --> 59:29.566
It's starting to
be embarrassing.

59:31.000 --> 59:32.568
Embarrassing?

59:35.103 --> 59:36.903
Yeah, I mean, I don't
mean it like that,

59:36.905 --> 59:40.240
but the fact that
you can't be hired

59:40.242 --> 59:43.110
makes me look, you know, with
my friends, my colleagues...

59:43.112 --> 59:44.845
You're ashamed of me.

59:44.847 --> 59:46.912
I'm just wondering
if in Russia

59:46.914 --> 59:48.248
they didn't overestimate you.

59:48.250 --> 59:49.416
If you play as well as they say

59:49.418 --> 59:51.717
you do, why can't you get a job?

59:51.719 --> 59:52.588
I don't...

59:56.391 --> 59:58.925
Look at Amanda, she's
playing all the time.

59:58.927 --> 01:00:00.726
I saw her in Singapore and...

01:00:00.728 --> 01:00:02.396
You saw her?

01:00:02.398 --> 01:00:04.164
Yeah, she was
playing in Singapore.

01:00:04.166 --> 01:00:05.666
That's my point exactly.

01:00:05.668 --> 01:00:08.001
Her concert was sold-out.

01:00:08.003 --> 01:00:09.338
Bravo, Amanda!

01:00:12.173 --> 01:00:13.907
Okay, welcome back.

01:01:42.264 --> 01:01:43.829
Yes, good afternoon.

01:01:43.831 --> 01:01:45.231
This is Mathieu
Focigny's mother,

01:01:45.233 --> 01:01:46.999
and I need to speak with him.

01:01:47.001 --> 01:01:47.836
I know...

01:01:49.371 --> 01:01:50.637
Yes, I know.

01:01:50.639 --> 01:01:54.775
He does have a cellphone, but
I don't know what's going on.

01:01:54.777 --> 01:01:57.309
Maybe it's not working or
there's a problem with service

01:01:57.311 --> 01:01:59.512
because I haven't been
able to reach him.

01:01:59.514 --> 01:02:02.782
So, I mean, if you could
just go to his room

01:02:02.784 --> 01:02:04.550
and ask him to
come on the phone?

01:02:04.552 --> 01:02:07.389
It's room 18 on the first floor.

01:02:09.056 --> 01:02:12.793
Yes, I know you don't
usually do that.

01:02:12.795 --> 01:02:15.528
It's just that I
haven't heard from him

01:02:15.530 --> 01:02:19.268
in over a week, so I'm
a little concerned.

01:02:23.871 --> 01:02:27.474
Yes, I know he's big enough
to make his own phone calls.

01:02:27.476 --> 01:02:29.575
But, listen, I emailed him.

01:02:29.577 --> 01:02:30.577
I texted him.

01:02:30.579 --> 01:02:32.813
He's not getting back to
me, so if you could just

01:02:32.815 --> 01:02:36.753
please go find my son
and put him on the phone.

01:02:37.952 --> 01:02:41.054
I'm asking you as
his mother, okay?

01:02:41.056 --> 01:02:42.057
I'm worried!

01:02:46.295 --> 01:02:48.894
Well, can't you
make an exception?

01:02:48.896 --> 01:02:51.898
And, okay, if being his
mother isn't enough,

01:02:51.900 --> 01:02:54.300
maybe I can remind
you how much money

01:02:54.302 --> 01:02:57.306
I donate for this
school every year?

01:02:59.842 --> 01:03:01.907
No, okay, thank you.

01:03:01.909 --> 01:03:02.976
I'm waiting.

01:03:30.338 --> 01:03:31.206
Mommy!

01:03:40.882 --> 01:03:41.951
No!

01:04:06.675 --> 01:04:07.507
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:04:12.648 --> 01:04:13.979
Come in.

01:04:13.981 --> 01:04:15.981
No, thanks.

01:04:15.983 --> 01:04:17.983
I can't stay very long.

01:04:17.985 --> 01:04:19.019
Here's the iPad.

01:04:19.021 --> 01:04:20.022
Thank you.

01:04:21.123 --> 01:04:22.521
Paul has been tired lately.

01:04:22.523 --> 01:04:23.757
He keeps forgetting
things everywhere.

01:04:23.759 --> 01:04:28.595
Right, well, no wonder, he
accumulates jet lag, you know?

01:04:28.597 --> 01:04:29.996
How's Keoshka?

01:04:29.998 --> 01:04:30.697
Oh, he's good.

01:04:30.699 --> 01:04:32.298
He's good, he's playing.

01:04:32.300 --> 01:04:36.471
Changes so fast, I just miss
him being a baby already.

01:04:39.675 --> 01:04:42.010
When Mathieu was a baby,

01:04:44.012 --> 01:04:47.579
he was so cute.

01:04:47.581 --> 01:04:48.583
Never cried.

01:04:51.420 --> 01:04:53.720
Never threw a tantrum.

01:04:53.722 --> 01:04:57.958
I remember looking at
pregnant women on the street

01:04:57.960 --> 01:04:59.726
and thinking, "Why
are they having kids?

01:04:59.728 --> 01:05:02.295
"We don't need any more
kids on this planet

01:05:02.297 --> 01:05:06.369
"because Mathieu
is here and he's perfect."

01:05:10.304 --> 01:05:11.570
And now the perfect child won't

01:05:11.572 --> 01:05:14.242
talk to me on the phone anymore.

01:05:18.579 --> 01:05:22.050
I should put him in
a different school.

01:05:27.188 --> 01:05:28.957
Anyway, I have to go.

01:05:30.592 --> 01:05:32.057
Thank you for stopping by.

01:05:32.059 --> 01:05:33.059
You're welcome, bye.

01:05:33.061 --> 01:05:34.094
Bye.

01:07:02.451 --> 01:07:04.818
Mommy!

01:07:04.820 --> 01:07:05.688
I'm hungry!

01:07:07.822 --> 01:07:09.157
I'm hungry!

01:07:15.831 --> 01:07:18.434
No, you're a mom!

01:07:26.440 --> 01:07:28.309
I'm hungry!

01:07:30.244 --> 01:07:31.179
I'm hungry!

01:07:38.320 --> 01:07:39.321
Stop, Mommy!

01:07:50.865 --> 01:07:53.733
American public
is easily satisfied.

01:07:53.735 --> 01:07:55.534
She's not that good actually.

01:07:55.536 --> 01:07:56.668
What do you mean?

01:07:56.670 --> 01:07:58.271
She's excellent.

01:07:58.273 --> 01:08:00.139
Some parts were
played too loose.

01:08:00.141 --> 01:08:03.208
She made mistakes, technically.

01:08:03.210 --> 01:08:05.512
You're just jealous.

01:08:05.514 --> 01:08:06.479
I'm not jealous.

01:08:06.481 --> 01:08:07.746
I'm just talking as a pianist.

01:08:07.748 --> 01:08:10.752
Well, you're not
a pianist anymore.

01:08:18.225 --> 01:08:19.091
Wow!

01:08:19.094 --> 01:08:20.759
Oh, and I spoke
with Arnold Dieser,

01:08:20.761 --> 01:08:23.662
and he invited us to
his party tonight.

01:08:23.663 --> 01:08:24.930
Isn't it wonderful?

01:08:24.932 --> 01:08:27.232
Oh, which reminds me, I
have to call the nanny

01:08:27.234 --> 01:08:29.169
because, you know, I don't want

01:08:29.171 --> 01:08:30.502
to bring Mathieu,
and you should call...

01:08:30.505 --> 01:08:31.670
I'm calling her now.

01:08:31.671 --> 01:08:33.406
For Keoshka, you
don't want to bring him.

01:08:33.408 --> 01:08:34.374
Why?

01:08:34.376 --> 01:08:35.174
Mr. Dieser might not mind.

01:08:35.176 --> 01:08:37.242
He has children himself.

01:08:37.243 --> 01:08:39.912
No, of course not, we're
not bringing Keoshka.

01:08:39.913 --> 01:08:40.746
Well, I'm calling...

01:08:40.747 --> 01:08:42.915
Look, I'm just
going to go home.

01:08:42.917 --> 01:08:44.450
What are you talking about?

01:08:44.452 --> 01:08:45.451
Of course you have to come.

01:08:45.453 --> 01:08:46.919
You have to meet
this guy, this...

01:08:46.921 --> 01:08:47.787
Why?

01:08:47.788 --> 01:08:51.191
I thought I wasn't
a pianist anymore.

01:08:51.193 --> 01:08:52.724
Okay, I'm gonna go get a cab.

01:08:52.725 --> 01:08:55.394
I'm calling the nanny.

01:08:55.395 --> 01:08:57.397
Is something wrong?

01:08:57.399 --> 01:08:58.267
No.

01:09:00.533 --> 01:09:02.203
I forgot my purse.

01:09:09.944 --> 01:09:12.881
Veronica Orlova,
what a surprise!

01:09:14.682 --> 01:09:15.747
You remember me?

01:09:15.750 --> 01:09:18.451
If I, of course I do!

01:09:18.453 --> 01:09:20.586
I'm a big fan of yours.

01:09:20.587 --> 01:09:23.488
It's such a pleasure
finally to get to meet you.

01:09:23.490 --> 01:09:24.557
Thank you!

01:09:24.559 --> 01:09:25.825
Thank you.

01:09:25.827 --> 01:09:26.960
Now, how did you
like the concert?

01:09:26.962 --> 01:09:28.229
Uh, good.

01:09:29.462 --> 01:09:32.564
I mean, there's some weakness
here and there, and I won't

01:09:32.567 --> 01:09:36.301
compare that performance
with your immense talent.

01:09:36.304 --> 01:09:37.736
Do you know that
I still remember

01:09:37.738 --> 01:09:41.307
your interpretation
of Bach in Berlin?

01:09:41.309 --> 01:09:44.313
That was a different
world entirely!

01:09:45.511 --> 01:09:47.582
Why did you stop playing?

01:09:48.783 --> 01:09:50.616
So she's not a
first-rate pianist?

01:09:50.618 --> 01:09:53.986
I plan to give her
a great review anyway.

01:09:53.988 --> 01:09:55.988
Why not just
writing the truth?

01:09:55.990 --> 01:09:58.327
I meant to encourage her.

01:10:00.261 --> 01:10:02.794
Right, but did she
talk to you about me?

01:10:02.796 --> 01:10:03.631
No, why?

01:10:05.667 --> 01:10:10.335
I was just thinking I might
want to start playing again.

01:10:10.337 --> 01:10:11.737
That
would be wonderful!

01:10:11.739 --> 01:10:14.473
Of course you should
start playing again!

01:10:14.475 --> 01:10:17.009
You had such perfect technique.

01:10:17.011 --> 01:10:18.644
Well, that's exactly
what was wrong with it.

01:10:18.646 --> 01:10:19.912
You see, everyone loved it.

01:10:19.914 --> 01:10:24.220
It was perfect execution, but
I always felt it wasn't music.

01:10:30.057 --> 01:10:30.889
It wasn't music.

01:10:30.891 --> 01:10:31.824
It was doing music.

01:10:31.826 --> 01:10:33.625
It wasn't being a musician.

01:10:33.627 --> 01:10:35.530
It was acting like one.

01:10:36.930 --> 01:10:40.633
There was no substance,
you understand?

01:10:40.635 --> 01:10:42.835
I'm afraid I do.

01:10:42.837 --> 01:10:45.504
Does that mean you
abandon the piano?

01:10:45.506 --> 01:10:47.440
No, no, I feel I've learned

01:10:47.442 --> 01:10:49.541
something in the past few years.

01:10:49.543 --> 01:10:51.376
It's hard to explain it.

01:10:51.378 --> 01:10:53.379
You see, if I had to
play now, it would be

01:10:53.381 --> 01:10:54.914
completely different,
and then if I fail...

01:10:54.916 --> 01:10:57.386
Dead for the music world.

01:10:58.386 --> 01:11:00.553
That's why I'm a
critic, you see.

01:11:00.555 --> 01:11:01.990
I prefer to live.

01:11:03.524 --> 01:11:07.326
What do you have
to gain in trying?

01:11:07.328 --> 01:11:08.428
I have to grow.

01:11:08.430 --> 01:11:09.995
Grow?

01:11:09.997 --> 01:11:11.830
What do you want from me?

01:11:11.832 --> 01:11:13.835
Arnold, there you are!

01:11:14.802 --> 01:11:16.402
Everyone's going.

01:11:16.404 --> 01:11:18.937
I have a cab waiting for us.

01:11:18.939 --> 01:11:21.107
It's not nice to
keep him waiting.

01:11:21.109 --> 01:11:25.280
He can't be late to his
own party.

01:11:34.689 --> 01:11:38.991
And to me, the most important
thing is that I live my art.

01:11:38.993 --> 01:11:40.992
And I engage myself
completely in it

01:11:40.994 --> 01:11:44.363
hour after hour, day after day.

01:11:44.365 --> 01:11:45.598
Cheers, everyone!

01:11:45.600 --> 01:11:46.098
Cheers!

01:11:46.100 --> 01:11:48.000
Bravo, bravo!

01:12:18.466 --> 01:12:19.132
I didn't know you were here.

01:12:19.134 --> 01:12:20.368
But I'm here!

01:12:21.569 --> 01:12:24.803
And who is this blond person
who seems eager to talk to you?

01:12:24.805 --> 01:12:26.138
That's Paul's wife.

01:12:26.140 --> 01:12:27.906
What is she doing?

01:12:27.908 --> 01:12:29.642
She's a pianist, I think.

01:12:29.644 --> 01:12:30.476
She doesn't play.

01:12:44.893 --> 01:12:47.160
Hi, have you seen Paul?

01:12:47.162 --> 01:12:48.494
Paul?

01:12:48.496 --> 01:12:49.961
He disappeared with Amanda.

01:12:49.963 --> 01:12:51.030
I think they went to smoke.

01:12:51.032 --> 01:12:54.500
Maybe downstairs, there
is another exit there.

01:13:43.117 --> 01:13:45.721
Oh, um, I'm sorry.

01:14:01.836 --> 01:14:03.835
Hey, Veronica,
did you see my wife?

01:14:03.837 --> 01:14:05.036
No.

01:14:05.038 --> 01:14:06.238
Are you okay?

01:14:06.240 --> 01:14:08.574
Yeah,
I did see her.

01:14:08.576 --> 01:14:10.276
Downstairs?

01:14:10.278 --> 01:14:12.711
No, I think
they went to smoke with Paul.

01:14:12.713 --> 01:14:14.045
I will join them.

01:14:14.047 --> 01:14:16.115
No,
upstairs, on the terrace.

01:14:40.274 --> 01:14:42.607
- What?
- Can we go home please?

01:14:42.609 --> 01:14:43.509
Now?

01:14:43.511 --> 01:14:45.745
Why is everybody
just standing around

01:14:45.747 --> 01:14:47.013
when there is food on the table?

01:14:47.015 --> 01:14:48.080
Amanda is here!

01:14:48.082 --> 01:14:49.248
Please!

01:14:49.250 --> 01:14:51.284
Everyone, let's have a
toast for the star of the day!

01:14:52.554 --> 01:14:53.619
To Amanda!

01:14:53.621 --> 01:14:54.920
Amanda!

01:14:54.922 --> 01:14:56.555
- Wonderful!
- Cheers!

01:14:59.627 --> 01:15:02.294
I hired a wonderful
French cook.

01:15:02.296 --> 01:15:05.565
Ever since she began with
me, I've gained 20 pounds.

01:15:07.935 --> 01:15:09.902
I miss French food.

01:15:09.904 --> 01:15:11.903
Do you cook
Russian food at home?

01:15:11.905 --> 01:15:13.305
Yes, Paul likes it.

01:15:16.109 --> 01:15:18.110
What did you say?

01:15:18.112 --> 01:15:21.680
I just said I'm not that
crazy about Russian food.

01:15:21.682 --> 01:15:24.349
Come on, you always
say you like my cooking.

01:15:24.351 --> 01:15:25.250
Yeah, I like your cooking.

01:15:25.252 --> 01:15:26.919
Of course, chérie,
I like your cooking,

01:15:26.921 --> 01:15:29.088
but it's not like good
French food, you know?

01:15:29.090 --> 01:15:30.057
That's all.

01:15:34.127 --> 01:15:36.963
Well, I'm French
and I never cook.

01:15:36.965 --> 01:15:38.263
And we thank you for that!

01:15:42.337 --> 01:15:44.336
What about you,
Amanda, do you cook?

01:15:44.338 --> 01:15:45.571
Oh, me?

01:15:45.573 --> 01:15:48.674
No, I don't like any kind of
manual activities that dirties

01:15:48.676 --> 01:15:52.711
the hands, you know, cooking,
painting, gardening.

01:15:52.713 --> 01:15:54.613
I like to get my hands dirty.

01:15:56.083 --> 01:15:58.683
Well, I've noticed that
people that are handy

01:15:58.685 --> 01:16:00.620
are often awkward
with their words.

01:16:00.622 --> 01:16:02.354
Have you noticed that too?

01:16:02.356 --> 01:16:04.757
Yes, but it is because
people that are good

01:16:04.759 --> 01:16:06.358
with their hands don't
need to talk that much.

01:16:09.963 --> 01:16:12.098
You know, Amanda is
not only a great pianist.

01:16:12.100 --> 01:16:14.232
She also has a beautiful voice.

01:16:14.234 --> 01:16:15.701
Really?

01:16:15.703 --> 01:16:17.402
She has a nice mouth.

01:16:18.905 --> 01:16:20.839
Someone has
had too much to drink.

01:16:20.841 --> 01:16:21.710
He has.

01:16:22.877 --> 01:16:24.376
I just think,
though, that he meant

01:16:24.378 --> 01:16:27.245
that he wanted to hear me sing.

01:16:27.247 --> 01:16:29.648
Exactly, I want
to hear you sing.

01:16:29.650 --> 01:16:30.517
Come on, sing us a song.

01:16:30.519 --> 01:16:32.018
- No, not here.
- Yes, sing a song!

01:16:32.020 --> 01:16:33.852
Everyone, sing a song!

01:18:04.078 --> 01:18:04.946
Veronica!

01:18:09.082 --> 01:18:09.884
Veronica!

01:18:11.485 --> 01:18:12.985
Veronica, stop!

01:18:12.987 --> 01:18:14.954
Come on, come on!

01:18:14.956 --> 01:18:17.859
Stop, stop, stop,
stop, stop, stop!

01:18:19.527 --> 01:18:20.358
What was that?

01:18:20.360 --> 01:18:21.826
What happened, huh?

01:18:21.828 --> 01:18:23.963
Why do you have to be so blunt?

01:18:23.965 --> 01:18:25.231
Why do you have to be so rough?

01:18:25.233 --> 01:18:26.965
No, you, what's
wrong with you?

01:18:26.967 --> 01:18:29.101
What are you doing with Amanda?

01:18:29.103 --> 01:18:30.035
Amanda?

01:18:30.037 --> 01:18:31.836
She's a childhood friend!

01:18:31.838 --> 01:18:33.037
Your mind is dirty!

01:18:33.039 --> 01:18:34.839
I was just relaxing a
bit from you, actually!

01:18:34.841 --> 01:18:36.107
You're so damn uptight.

01:18:36.109 --> 01:18:39.144
Oh, and Adele, now
my cooking is not good!

01:18:39.146 --> 01:18:40.379
There's always something!

01:18:40.381 --> 01:18:42.380
You're all against
me all the time!

01:18:42.382 --> 01:18:44.849
Adele has high
standards, that's all.

01:18:44.851 --> 01:18:46.117
There is nothing
wrong with that!

01:18:46.119 --> 01:18:47.052
High standards?

01:18:47.054 --> 01:18:48.320
Not morally, she doesn't.

01:18:48.322 --> 01:18:50.856
She always trashes me
in front of everyone.

01:18:50.858 --> 01:18:52.290
She didn't trash you.

01:18:52.292 --> 01:18:53.526
She didn't!

01:18:53.528 --> 01:18:54.527
That was just French irony!

01:18:54.529 --> 01:18:57.263
You take it or leave it!

01:18:57.265 --> 01:18:58.397
You know what?

01:18:58.399 --> 01:19:00.866
Adele is a very smart woman.

01:19:00.868 --> 01:19:02.535
She's smarter than
you, smarter than me.

01:19:02.537 --> 01:19:03.869
She works a lot!

01:19:03.871 --> 01:19:04.570
She helps a lot of people!

01:19:04.572 --> 01:19:06.138
What do you do, huh?

01:19:06.140 --> 01:19:08.874
Who are you to talk like
that about my friends?

01:19:08.876 --> 01:19:10.308
I'm the woman you love.

01:19:10.310 --> 01:19:13.478
I'm the mother of your child.

01:19:13.480 --> 01:19:14.815
Does that count?

01:19:18.286 --> 01:19:19.954
That's not enough.

01:19:26.060 --> 01:19:26.895
Taxi!

01:19:29.063 --> 01:19:29.898
Taxi!

01:19:31.932 --> 01:19:35.366
You know that you
have never said

01:19:35.368 --> 01:19:39.037
anything nice about my
friends, not once, not once.

01:19:39.039 --> 01:19:42.040
Every time we see
my friends, you

01:19:42.042 --> 01:19:43.576
have something to
complain about.

01:19:43.578 --> 01:19:45.177
I have been trying and trying.

01:19:45.179 --> 01:19:46.611
No, you haven't been trying.

01:19:46.613 --> 01:19:48.613
I'm sorry, you
haven't been trying.

01:19:48.615 --> 01:19:51.183
And don't try to cut
me off my friends.

01:19:51.185 --> 01:19:52.585
It's not gonna happen.

01:19:52.587 --> 01:19:54.053
Don't you understand
I need them?

01:19:54.055 --> 01:19:55.387
They're all I have here.

01:19:55.389 --> 01:19:58.190
Who else am I gonna
talk to, your friends?

01:19:58.192 --> 01:20:01.930
Oh yeah, that's right,
you don't have any.

01:20:03.463 --> 01:20:05.964
You're so into Keoshka,
Keoshka, Keoshka,

01:20:05.966 --> 01:20:10.335
you haven't made one friend
in four years, not one!

01:20:10.337 --> 01:20:12.071
Is that normal?

01:20:12.073 --> 01:20:13.339
Tell me, is it normal?

01:20:13.341 --> 01:20:15.139
I'm telling you
it's not healthy!

01:20:15.141 --> 01:20:16.608
My friends
are in Russia, okay?

01:20:16.610 --> 01:20:18.943
But we're not in Russia!

01:20:18.945 --> 01:20:20.612
We're in New York!

01:20:20.614 --> 01:20:25.250
My friends should be
your friends, that's it!

01:20:25.252 --> 01:20:26.085
Who?

01:20:26.087 --> 01:20:27.018
Adele?

01:20:27.020 --> 01:20:28.954
She has no friends herself!

01:20:28.956 --> 01:20:30.958
Amanda is a complete fake!

01:20:31.958 --> 01:20:34.226
What's your point?

01:20:34.228 --> 01:20:37.028
Adele has her own
circle of people.

01:20:37.030 --> 01:20:40.398
Unlike you, she
doesn't need friends.

01:20:40.400 --> 01:20:41.299
Veronica!

01:21:44.731 --> 01:21:46.965
What are you guys doing?

01:21:46.967 --> 01:21:49.601
Just playing.

01:21:49.603 --> 01:21:50.969
I thought you were still out.

01:21:50.971 --> 01:21:52.072
I have to go.

01:21:53.239 --> 01:21:56.610
I have to meet someone
midtown, for work.

01:21:58.746 --> 01:22:01.917
Okay, when are
you coming back?

01:22:04.051 --> 01:22:05.320
I don't know.

01:22:06.753 --> 01:22:08.454
Just don't wait for me.

01:22:08.456 --> 01:22:09.324
Okay.

01:22:12.726 --> 01:22:13.961
Okay.

01:22:21.002 --> 01:22:21.733
Yes.

01:23:18.125 --> 01:23:18.993
Mommy!

01:23:22.529 --> 01:23:24.131
I need to go pee!

01:23:29.837 --> 01:23:30.672
No!

01:23:41.414 --> 01:23:42.449
I want juice!

01:23:44.150 --> 01:23:45.286
I want juice!

01:23:46.820 --> 01:23:48.689
I want orange juice!

01:23:59.833 --> 01:24:01.567
I'm thirsty!

01:24:01.569 --> 01:24:02.634
Why aren't you
getting me a drink?

01:24:05.472 --> 01:24:06.304
Give me.

01:24:06.306 --> 01:24:07.307
I'm thirsty.

01:24:08.309 --> 01:24:09.110
Hey!

01:24:10.310 --> 01:24:12.380
Why are you putting that?

01:24:13.581 --> 01:24:15.347
I don't want pulp.

01:24:24.524 --> 01:24:26.326
Hey, that's my juice!

01:24:28.128 --> 01:24:28.960
I'm thirsty!

01:24:28.962 --> 01:24:31.629
Why aren't you
getting me a drink?

01:24:31.631 --> 01:24:34.665
I don't like pulp.

01:24:34.667 --> 01:24:36.401
I don't like pulp.

01:24:36.403 --> 01:24:37.736
I don't like pulp!

01:25:01.662 --> 01:25:03.231
What happened?

01:25:03.898 --> 01:25:05.229
What happened?

01:26:16.573 --> 01:26:21.573
