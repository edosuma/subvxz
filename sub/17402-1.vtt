00:15.520 --> 00:18.720
- APPLAUSE
- Hello!

00:18.720 --> 00:24.440
Hello, everybody! Thank you so much.
We're back!

00:24.440 --> 00:26.600
We are back!

00:29.640 --> 00:31.800
Yes, however, we're back

00:31.800 --> 00:35.800
and I'm sure many of you will be
delighted to hear that in this,

00:35.800 --> 00:42.120
our 20th series, we've slowed down
a little and grown up a lot.

00:42.120 --> 00:44.520
LAUGHTER

00:44.520 --> 00:46.600
We have. To show you what I mean,

00:46.600 --> 00:51.200
we've prepared a montage
which shows what you can expect

00:51.200 --> 00:55.680
over the coming weeks from
a new, more mature Top Gear.

00:59.840 --> 01:01.560
Gentlemen, the time has come.

01:06.520 --> 01:08.400
Oh, you're joking!

01:11.040 --> 01:14.720
What I'm saying is, we turn this
town into a street circuit.

01:14.720 --> 01:16.800
TYRES SCREECH

01:20.160 --> 01:21.480
Oh, God. Ow!

01:23.600 --> 01:25.920
He's looking good there,
looking good.

01:34.000 --> 01:35.520
Sorry.

01:39.040 --> 01:41.120
- It's uphill. - Yeah! - Keep going!
- Hell, yeah.

01:43.840 --> 01:45.720
It is a rampant rabbit.

01:50.080 --> 01:52.080
There has been a crash.

01:52.080 --> 01:54.040
Oooh, in the face!

01:58.080 --> 01:59.200
I can hear a bike.

02:02.640 --> 02:04.960
What did we learn, really?

02:04.960 --> 02:07.320
APPLAUSE

02:08.800 --> 02:11.560
Not much evidence of maturity there!

02:11.560 --> 02:15.520
Because there isn't any.
But anyway! That is all to come.

02:15.520 --> 02:17.640
Some of it later on,

02:17.640 --> 02:20.880
but we begin in the 1980s.

02:20.880 --> 02:24.520
Back then hot hatchbacks
were very, very popular.

02:24.520 --> 02:28.280
Everybody wanted to steal one
and perhaps that's why

02:28.280 --> 02:31.320
they went away
but now they're coming back,

02:31.320 --> 02:33.440
and we thought
we ought to see what is what.

02:33.440 --> 02:36.400
So, Richard Hammond
is your adjudicator

02:36.400 --> 02:39.680
and the track is our battleground.

02:44.240 --> 02:48.160
This is the first one to come
charging over the top.

02:48.160 --> 02:50.960
The Peugeot 208 GTi.

02:54.640 --> 02:57.280
Righty-oh! What we are looking for
here is something

02:57.280 --> 02:58.880
we haven't seen in a long while.

02:58.880 --> 03:03.040
A Peugeot where you can
actually feel its pulse.

03:04.040 --> 03:06.360
And it is off to a promising start

03:06.360 --> 03:09.320
because they certainly
have not scrimped on power.

03:10.720 --> 03:14.760
200 Horsepower, that's what you
get from the 1.6 litre turbo,

03:14.760 --> 03:18.240
and that's quite a generous helping
in a little car.

03:19.840 --> 03:23.080
0 to 60 is dispatched
in under seven seconds.

03:25.320 --> 03:30.800
Then comes the torque.
Quite a lot of it, 203 ft-lbs.

03:33.960 --> 03:38.280
It's like surfing a giant wave
of exploding petrol.

03:45.640 --> 03:49.400
The designers have been allowed
to enjoy themselves too.

03:49.400 --> 03:51.280
Because everywhere you look

03:51.280 --> 03:55.560
there are little reminders
of the much-loved 205 GTi.

03:59.160 --> 04:01.760
It's good, it shows intent.

04:01.760 --> 04:05.000
Like this chubby little steering
wheel, it says, "Come on,

04:05.000 --> 04:07.640
"Let's get on and do something."

04:07.640 --> 04:12.200
Which brings us neatly to
the most important part of a GTi.

04:12.200 --> 04:15.520
What happens when you ask it
to go round a corner? Come on,

04:15.520 --> 04:19.120
little Peugeot, let's see
if you can set my trousers on fire.

04:22.920 --> 04:24.960
There it is!

04:26.880 --> 04:28.480
HE LAUGHS

04:28.480 --> 04:30.840
TYRES SCREECH

04:32.920 --> 04:34.680
It does eat up corners.

04:36.760 --> 04:41.040
It's light, there's loads of grip
and I swear I am cocking a wheel,

04:41.040 --> 04:42.960
I'm sure I am.

04:44.400 --> 04:47.760
That's a wheel in the air.
Bit of that.

04:47.760 --> 04:50.120
Turn the indicators off
and carry on like you meant it.

04:50.120 --> 04:51.440
That's the way to do it.

04:53.680 --> 04:57.760
There's no doubt about it,
this car is a real return to form

04:57.760 --> 05:02.400
from a company that has been stuck in
a rut of dreary boxes for too long.

05:02.400 --> 05:09.040
But remember, we are now
in a GTi war and to win it,

05:09.040 --> 05:11.800
the Peugeot must take on this...

05:15.400 --> 05:17.360
..the brand-new hot Renault Clio.

05:24.080 --> 05:26.320
Like the Peugeot it doesn't lack
for oomph,

05:26.320 --> 05:27.800
197 brake horsepower.

05:29.560 --> 05:33.120
From, like the Peugeot,
a 1.6 litre turbo.

05:34.800 --> 05:39.160
But where the Peugeot
looks back to the old 205,

05:39.160 --> 05:44.600
the Renault is aimed squarely
at today's computer geeks.

05:47.000 --> 05:51.200
This central screen here
I've got gauges, a lot of them.

05:53.400 --> 05:57.320
I've got a G diagram of...my G.

05:57.320 --> 06:00.720
And then this is real
PlayStation stuff, you can

06:00.720 --> 06:03.240
actually change
the sound of the engine.

06:03.240 --> 06:08.080
You go into the menu and you can
select the noise from different cars.

06:08.080 --> 06:12.000
Like a Renault Alpine which is an old
classic or even an Nissan GTR.

06:12.000 --> 06:15.640
So I'm going to have...a V6.

06:18.000 --> 06:20.120
ENGINE REVS

06:20.120 --> 06:24.000
Oooh, that sounds... Yeah!

06:24.000 --> 06:27.080
If ten-year-olds could drive,
they would love this.

06:29.400 --> 06:33.880
And then when you push this button,
a strangely familiar crash

06:33.880 --> 06:37.080
helmet appears and you can do this...

06:39.400 --> 06:40.880
ROARING OF TYRES

06:43.400 --> 06:46.840
It makes the brakes, everything
a lot more hard-core.

06:48.920 --> 06:50.800
Oh! Come on, that's feeling nice.

06:53.920 --> 06:55.960
Without doubt,

06:55.960 --> 07:00.240
the computerised Clio has a more
juvenile streak than the Peugeot.

07:02.920 --> 07:06.520
But sadly, it also has
a really annoying problem...

07:08.960 --> 07:13.200
This gearbox, it's about as sharp
as a vicar sweeping up leaves.

07:13.200 --> 07:16.080
Through the bends, it just
doesn't have the speed to react.

07:16.080 --> 07:17.520
And there's another problem,

07:17.520 --> 07:21.440
the whole idea of a flappy paddle
gearbox in a hot hatch.

07:21.440 --> 07:24.560
I don't want to sound like James May,
"I prefer the old-fashioned type."

07:24.560 --> 07:26.280
But I do.

07:26.280 --> 07:29.920
Changing gear is a vital form
of self-expression that
I am being denied.

07:33.560 --> 07:37.360
It's not like you can opt
for a manual either, because

07:37.360 --> 07:40.480
with this car it's flappy paddle
or nothing.

07:40.480 --> 07:42.560
The high-tech little Renault is good

07:42.560 --> 07:45.560
but the stupid gearbox
spoils your fun.

07:49.560 --> 07:52.960
And that leaves it vulnerable
to attack from this...

07:56.560 --> 07:58.120
..the Ford Fiesta ST.

07:59.360 --> 08:04.920
It's been five too long years
since Ford give us a hot Fiesta.

08:04.920 --> 08:07.520
On paper this thing looks to be
going into battle with

08:07.520 --> 08:10.160
the Frenchies on the back foot
because like the other two

08:10.160 --> 08:15.320
it has a 1.6 litre turbo,
but 20 brake horsepower less.

08:15.320 --> 08:17.280
179.

08:19.560 --> 08:22.920
But here's the thing, the other two
each cost just under 19 grand,

08:22.920 --> 08:24.640
but this is two grand cheaper.

08:27.160 --> 08:31.880
Yet despite the reasonable price,
the Fiesta certainly looks the part.

08:33.559 --> 08:39.200
It's got fat 17 inch alloys,
Recaro seats,

08:39.200 --> 08:43.840
and a full suite of skirts,
spoilers and big exhausts.

08:46.000 --> 08:51.120
All of which is very nice,
but with that 20 horsepower deficit,

08:51.120 --> 08:54.960
the Fiesta is still likely
to get a pasting in a drag race.

08:57.200 --> 09:02.000
But you never know, this
is lighter and it has more torque.

09:02.000 --> 09:04.640
It might win, or come second...

09:04.640 --> 09:06.080
or third.

09:08.920 --> 09:11.400
Three, two, one.

09:11.400 --> 09:12.520
Go!

09:17.280 --> 09:21.400
Changing gear as quickly as I can,
manually. I come down.

09:22.720 --> 09:27.120
Come on, come on, come on, Ford!
Come on!

09:27.120 --> 09:31.920
Oh! Yes, it's done the third thing,
the third option.

09:33.960 --> 09:36.640
But then I took
the Ford for a spot of cornering.

09:38.200 --> 09:40.960
TYRES SCREECH

09:48.480 --> 09:50.000
Oh, this is epic!

09:52.080 --> 09:55.480
The others have had their suspension
lowered a bit.

09:55.480 --> 09:59.160
This has had its dropped by
a whole juicy 15 millimetres.

10:02.400 --> 10:06.240
You can feel it. It corners flat.

10:09.560 --> 10:12.360
It's not just about being
nearer the ground.

10:12.360 --> 10:15.920
Everything about the Fiesta,
the steering, the handling,

10:15.920 --> 10:20.640
the responsiveness is peerless.
They've got this bang on right.

10:22.200 --> 10:23.240
It's brilliant.

10:24.960 --> 10:28.920
When you switch the traction control
off, it really is off.

10:31.840 --> 10:33.880
Ha, ha!

10:35.400 --> 10:38.480
Ford have remembered the key
mantra of a hot hatch, it is

10:38.480 --> 10:40.560
not just what it does,

10:40.560 --> 10:44.960
it's how it makes you feel
while it is doing it.

10:46.240 --> 10:48.440
You can't put a price on that.

10:50.760 --> 10:53.400
Superb!

10:58.880 --> 11:05.080
So, conclusion time. The Peugeot
and the Renault are really very good.

11:05.080 --> 11:09.440
But the Ford,
the Ford is simply brilliant.

11:13.480 --> 11:15.320
APPLAUSE

11:15.320 --> 11:17.120
It is, though. It is, it's fabulous.

11:17.120 --> 11:19.440
Superb.

11:19.440 --> 11:22.240
It's almost as though all the
planets aligned to make this car.

11:22.240 --> 11:25.320
- Exactly. - Everything was in place.
- Exactly it.

11:25.320 --> 11:28.400
In years to come, this will be looked
back on as an all-time classic.

11:28.400 --> 11:31.960
It's the same way we look back
now on the Sierra Cosworth or

11:31.960 --> 11:35.400
- the RS2000.
- The Mexico. - Lotus Cortina.

11:35.400 --> 11:37.440
That's how good this thing is.

11:37.440 --> 11:41.760
I mean, the other two are good, very
good, but this thing is just genius.

11:41.760 --> 11:45.680
It is. But is it the fastest
round our track? To find out

11:45.680 --> 11:48.880
we must give them all
to our tame racing driver.

11:48.880 --> 11:51.200
Some say he has
the world's largest

11:51.200 --> 11:53.280
collection of horse eggs.

11:55.480 --> 11:57.560
When he knocked Rafa Nadal out

11:57.560 --> 12:00.160
this week it wasn't during a game
of tennis.

12:01.800 --> 12:04.160
All we know is,
he's called The Stig!

12:04.160 --> 12:06.360
APPLAUSE

12:06.360 --> 12:08.680
And they're off.
A strong start from the Fiesta,

12:08.680 --> 12:10.160
but the other two soon level up

12:10.160 --> 12:13.480
as they pile down to the first
corner, turbos spinning furiously.

12:14.840 --> 12:17.000
Tyres howling
as they lurch to the left,

12:17.000 --> 12:20.680
but that is about as dramatic
as it gets so far.

12:20.680 --> 12:23.840
JAUNTY MUSIC

12:25.360 --> 12:29.880
I'm told The Stig was listening
to TV theme tunes there...

12:29.880 --> 12:33.080
It sounded like an accident
in a bric-a-brac shop.

12:33.080 --> 12:34.960
They swing round Chicago, no fuss.

12:36.080 --> 12:38.720
Into the Hammerhead, this should
root out under-steerers,

12:38.720 --> 12:40.120
they're all frontwheel drive.

12:40.120 --> 12:43.040
The Fiesta flashing its hazards
under hard braking,

12:43.040 --> 12:44.800
but they are all bang online.

12:44.800 --> 12:47.440
Very tidy. Impressive stuff.

12:47.440 --> 12:50.040
JAUNTY MUSIC

12:52.760 --> 12:56.520
Stig choosing to reverse round
in the Renault for some reason.

12:56.520 --> 12:58.800
Anyway, is the Fiesta's lack
of power going

12:58.800 --> 13:00.040
to be exposed here?

13:00.040 --> 13:02.720
No, not by the look of it.
Two corners left.

13:03.880 --> 13:06.880
The Peugeot cocking a wheel.

13:06.880 --> 13:08.560
Yes. There we are as we go

13:08.560 --> 13:10.120
to the second-to-last corner,

13:10.120 --> 13:12.920
only Gambon, all three scampering
through there.

13:12.920 --> 13:15.320
Not much between them
and across the line.

13:15.320 --> 13:17.600
APPLAUSE

13:17.600 --> 13:19.120
OK, now.

13:20.720 --> 13:24.720
The Renault...that did it in 1.32.

13:26.280 --> 13:28.320
The Peugeot, 1.33.2.

13:28.320 --> 13:32.400
And the Ford Fiesta, this is
the one we are interested in,

13:32.400 --> 13:35.640
1.32.7, so it's in the middle,
but it doesn't matter.

13:35.640 --> 13:38.200
This is still the one to buy.

13:38.200 --> 13:41.560
I honestly haven't driven
a car as surprising

13:41.560 --> 13:45.320
or as likeable as this
for a very long while.

13:45.320 --> 13:49.200
The only thing I don't like about it
is the name, ST.

13:49.200 --> 13:51.520
Why have they named it
after a lady towel?

13:53.720 --> 13:57.320
And now the news. The news is, you
may have read about this recently,

13:57.320 --> 14:00.960
there are plans to open pubs
in motorway service stations.

14:00.960 --> 14:02.800
- I don't get that.
- I don't get it either.

14:02.800 --> 14:05.840
Because as it's on a motorway,

14:05.840 --> 14:08.680
you are bound to be driving which
means you can only have one drink.

14:08.680 --> 14:11.280
And when it comes to drink,
one is impossible.

14:11.280 --> 14:13.800
- LAUGHTER
- Come on!

14:13.800 --> 14:19.040
- What if... What if you're
the passenger? - I see, James,

14:19.040 --> 14:20.760
- so I'm driving you. - Mm-hm.

14:20.760 --> 14:25.200
As I fill up with petrol, you say,
"I'm going to get a gin and tonic."

14:25.200 --> 14:26.400
Yes.

14:26.400 --> 14:29.520
Well, if you do that,
you may as well prepare a sign that

14:29.520 --> 14:31.840
says Hammersmith on a bit of card.

14:31.840 --> 14:34.840
Because when you come out,
I will have gone.

14:34.840 --> 14:38.600
I'm not actually that interested in
pubs in motorway service stations,

14:38.600 --> 14:40.960
what bothers me is
why do they sell trousers?

14:40.960 --> 14:42.680
I've never got halfway...

14:42.680 --> 14:46.120
Has anybody ever gone halfway
through a motorway

14:46.120 --> 14:49.160
and thought,
"I've forgot my trousers!

14:49.160 --> 14:51.680
"I had better get these elasticated
beige ones."

14:51.680 --> 14:54.560
I don't understand why people
even stop to eat at motorway

14:54.560 --> 14:56.400
service stations.

14:56.400 --> 14:59.280
There is no car journey in Britain
so long that you would starve

14:59.280 --> 15:01.240
to death before you got
somewhere to eat.

15:01.240 --> 15:05.200
Like the pub thing, it's not
that far to wait for a drink.

15:05.200 --> 15:07.920
You don't think, "I'm so desperate
I'm going to pull over

15:07.920 --> 15:09.880
"and have half a pint of shandy."

15:09.880 --> 15:11.480
Stupid.

15:11.480 --> 15:14.720
- I would. - That's cos you're
a raving alcoholic, James.

15:16.360 --> 15:19.280
- Can I move it on?
- We've got off topic here.

15:19.280 --> 15:21.760
Can I talk, please, about potholes?

15:21.760 --> 15:25.000
Where I live in Hertfordshire,
I came to work on my bike

15:25.000 --> 15:26.520
and I hit a pothole.

15:26.520 --> 15:30.520
It was vast, I shot up about 15 feet
in the air off the bike.

15:30.520 --> 15:32.120
By the time I was coming back down,

15:32.120 --> 15:34.280
the bike had hit the opposite wall,
it bounced up,

15:34.280 --> 15:38.840
as I was coming down, it leapt up
and head butted me in the plants.

15:38.840 --> 15:40.720
It was agony.

15:40.720 --> 15:42.800
That's why I was late
to the office, cos

15:42.800 --> 15:46.320
I had to stop by the side
of the road and massage them.

15:47.600 --> 15:49.280
Let's just get this straight.

15:49.280 --> 15:52.840
You were standing by the side
of a presumably busy main road,

15:52.840 --> 15:54.240
rubbing your testes?

15:54.240 --> 15:56.800
In leather trousers, yeah.

15:56.800 --> 16:00.240
Come to think of it, if you saw that,
that's what was going on.

16:01.720 --> 16:06.240
I tell you what though, Hammond,
the pothole is not the problem.

16:06.240 --> 16:09.920
It's a pothole that has been
repaired by a British worker johnny.

16:09.920 --> 16:12.320
Look at this. Look at that!

16:14.120 --> 16:17.600
How can you stand back and go,
"Yes, I have done a good job there?"

16:18.960 --> 16:21.000
It can't be that difficult
for a solution.

16:21.000 --> 16:24.880
They need to design like a liquid
that you just pour into

16:24.880 --> 16:29.520
potholes everywhere, and then it
sets, so it is self-level
and it would...

16:29.520 --> 16:31.440
Why could you not do that?

16:31.440 --> 16:35.320
- It is a brilliant idea.
- Thank you, it's mine! - It's available.

16:35.320 --> 16:37.160
My cheese sauce does that.

16:39.040 --> 16:42.120
James, you know I said
we'd got more mature in this series?

16:42.120 --> 16:46.160
- You've gone straight to dementia.
- No, no, no, no. - Cheese sauce?

16:46.160 --> 16:49.640
When I make cheese sauce, I always
make too much, like everybody does.

16:49.640 --> 16:52.280
So there is like a quarter
of an inch at the bottom of the pan

16:52.280 --> 16:54.840
and when you get up the next day,
that bit is so hard you either

16:54.840 --> 16:58.280
throw the pan away or you treat
that as the new bottom of the pan.

16:58.280 --> 16:59.920
LAUGHTER

16:59.920 --> 17:02.880
- If you put that in the hole,
Bob's your uncle. - Cheese sauce?

17:02.880 --> 17:07.520
- We've solved it.
- Bet you're glad we are back!

17:07.520 --> 17:12.400
How has the world managed without us
for the last few months?

17:12.400 --> 17:15.480
- Can I let you into a little secret?
- Oh, is it time?

17:15.480 --> 17:18.200
LAUGHTER

17:22.920 --> 17:25.520
APPLAUSE

17:25.520 --> 17:27.800
I think after 20 series...

17:29.890 --> 17:32.130
No, can I let you into
a little secret?

17:32.130 --> 17:34.330
You know those gantries over
the motorway,

17:34.330 --> 17:36.730
they've got them on the M25
and on the M1, OK?

17:36.730 --> 17:40.410
They have speed limits on them
so that you can temporarily lower

17:40.410 --> 17:44.210
the speed limit to warn drivers
of an accident or congestion ahead.

17:44.210 --> 17:47.010
And then there are speed cameras
on the back of the gantries to

17:47.010 --> 17:49.570
make sure that people do
actually slow down.

17:49.570 --> 17:51.890
Well, now here is my secret.

17:51.890 --> 17:55.610
It turns out the police can turn
those cameras on at

17:55.610 --> 17:58.330
- any time they like. - Really?

17:58.330 --> 18:01.130
Which means the Chief Constable
sitting there at his desk,

18:01.130 --> 18:02.250
"I fancy a new car."

18:02.250 --> 18:06.170
Pop the cameras on and after,
I was going to say half an hour,

18:06.170 --> 18:10.810
but probably ten seconds, he's got
enough for a supercharged Jag.

18:10.810 --> 18:13.090
LAUGHTER

18:13.090 --> 18:16.450
We should point out for reasons
of BBC impartiality that other

18:16.450 --> 18:21.570
luxury cars are available
to bent chiefs of policemen.

18:23.010 --> 18:25.850
- Right, now, can we talk about BMW?
- Yes. - Yes.

18:25.850 --> 18:27.610
They're on a bit of a roll
at the moment,

18:27.610 --> 18:30.130
- they are making some cracking cars.
- Very much so.

18:30.130 --> 18:32.570
Now there's another new one
coming called the 4 Series,

18:32.570 --> 18:34.210
we have a picture of it here.

18:34.210 --> 18:38.170
It is a replacement for the two-door
3 Series Coupe.

18:38.170 --> 18:40.330
I think that looks absolutely
fantastic,

18:40.330 --> 18:42.770
and best of all, there's going
to be a motor sport version.

18:42.770 --> 18:45.570
So that will be called the M4!

18:47.050 --> 18:50.850
So presumably it will be fantastic
at one end and then very dark

18:50.850 --> 18:52.770
and miserable at the other end.

18:52.770 --> 18:55.090
And then you will pay a toll to put
something in the boot

18:55.090 --> 18:57.170
but not to take it out again.

18:57.170 --> 19:00.010
Why are they naming it after the M4 -
because it's awful?!

19:00.010 --> 19:02.170
I have to spend a lot of time on it

19:02.170 --> 19:05.090
and it is the worst motorway in
the world, so call it something else.

19:05.090 --> 19:06.730
Hang on a minute.
If you think the M4

19:06.730 --> 19:08.250
is the worst motorway, why do you

19:08.250 --> 19:10.250
spend all your life
driving up and down it?

19:10.250 --> 19:12.170
Because I live at
the other end of it.

19:12.170 --> 19:15.570
- Why don't you live at our end of it?
- Because my house is at the other end.

19:15.570 --> 19:17.770
- Well, move house.
- I like living there,

19:17.770 --> 19:20.130
I just don't like travelling
there on the motorway.

19:20.130 --> 19:22.010
But that's a large part
of living there.

19:22.010 --> 19:23.530
Yes, but I like being on Top Gear.

19:23.530 --> 19:26.130
- I don't like having to talk to you
to get there. - You should live

19:26.130 --> 19:29.850
where Top Gear is made.
You can live at our end, you can
do things like have electricity,

19:29.850 --> 19:32.330
sewers, watch television.

19:32.330 --> 19:36.690
I like my end of the M4, I just
don't like the bit in between it

19:36.690 --> 19:38.290
and where you are.

19:38.290 --> 19:39.690
How much of a shock is it to you

19:39.690 --> 19:42.730
to get into a car where we live
and get out the other end,

19:42.730 --> 19:45.450
all you can do is light a candle
and make your own chutney?

19:45.450 --> 19:47.970
LAUGHTER
I like it.

19:47.970 --> 19:51.450
Anyway, the BMW goes on sale at
the end of the year, prices start at

19:51.450 --> 19:54.490
£31,500, unless of course you live
where Hammond does, in which case

19:54.490 --> 19:56.810
it is 16 groats and an oxen.

19:59.570 --> 20:03.450
Now, moving on,
tonight we are going to have a race

20:03.450 --> 20:06.690
and it is a very important one,
because it is to see which is

20:06.690 --> 20:11.850
fastest, Jeremy in a car,
or me on a sailing boat.

20:11.850 --> 20:14.050
First of all, we needed a course.

20:14.050 --> 20:16.930
The producer suggested
we go from Great Yarmouth

20:16.930 --> 20:19.410
up the North Sea to Edinburgh.

20:19.410 --> 20:23.370
Or perhaps from Aberystwyth
down through the Irish Sea

20:23.370 --> 20:25.650
to the Lizard Point in Cornwall.

20:25.650 --> 20:29.050
But then James
and I had a better idea.

20:29.050 --> 20:30.490
Yes, we did.

20:34.810 --> 20:39.730
'Welcome to New Zealand.
The perfect location for our duel.

20:39.730 --> 20:43.690
'Pretty landscapes for Jeremy
to drive through

20:43.690 --> 20:47.490
'and most importantly for me,
sea that's warm.'

20:48.570 --> 20:52.050
So our race -
this is what New Zealand looks like.

20:52.050 --> 20:55.170
This is the bit we are interested
in, blown up for you here.

20:55.170 --> 20:58.890
I shall be starting from this
very beach, here on the map,

20:58.890 --> 21:03.890
and racing up here to the second
most northerly point in New Zealand.

21:03.890 --> 21:07.010
Jeremy, meanwhile,
will have to go down here, through

21:07.010 --> 21:11.690
the centre of Auckland and all the
way up here to reach the same point.

21:11.690 --> 21:16.410
So I only have to cover 220 miles,

21:16.410 --> 21:19.970
Jeremy has to cover 410.

21:21.730 --> 21:24.770
'To make matters even
worse for Jeremy, 35%

21:24.770 --> 21:29.330
'of New Zealand's roads are unpaved,
which would slow him down.

21:29.330 --> 21:33.170
'And this is what
he would be up against.

21:33.170 --> 21:36.890
'It's called an AC45 and it's
the fastest production

21:36.890 --> 21:39.610
'sailing boat in the world.

21:42.250 --> 21:46.610
'With a carbon fibre hull
and a rigid sail as big as the wing

21:46.610 --> 21:50.410
'on a Boeing 737,
it can reach over 30 knots.

21:52.290 --> 21:57.450
'Then there's the crew. All but one
are winners of the America's Cup,

21:57.450 --> 22:00.890
'the most prestigious trophy
in yacht racing.

22:00.890 --> 22:04.570
'And as for the one who isn't,
well, he is Sir Ben Ainslie,

22:04.570 --> 22:08.050
'four times Olympic
sailing gold medallist.

22:11.250 --> 22:15.290
'Put all this together
and Jeremy hasn't got a chance.'

22:17.330 --> 22:21.290
I do realise the enormity
of the challenge I face, which is

22:21.290 --> 22:25.690
why I have gone for the fastest
car in the world.

22:25.690 --> 22:28.170
Here it is.

22:28.170 --> 22:31.730
- It's a Toyota Corolla. - Is that what
it is, I haven't looked? Yes, it is.

22:31.730 --> 22:34.530
It's a 1.8 litre Toyota Corolla.

22:34.530 --> 22:37.050
Engine size is irrelevant, James,

22:37.050 --> 22:40.530
because do you know what makes this
so fast?

22:40.530 --> 22:43.050
Look in the window.

22:43.050 --> 22:48.170
- I've rented it. - Oh, no. - Yes!
And this is the thing, you see.

22:48.170 --> 22:51.090
The Bugatti Veyron, sometimes
you're using 15 horsepower,

22:51.090 --> 22:52.970
sometimes you're using only ten.

22:52.970 --> 22:56.850
This, you have 140 horsepower
from the moment you start it up

22:56.850 --> 22:58.810
to the moment you crash it.

22:58.810 --> 23:01.210
Did you pick up one of those,
what are they called,

23:01.210 --> 23:06.610
- collision damage waiver forms? - No,
I picked up six. I did, actually!

23:06.610 --> 23:09.890
When her back was turned, I thought,
I'll have some of those.

23:09.890 --> 23:13.970
- So you are ready? - I am really ready
for this. - Everybody else ready?

23:13.970 --> 23:18.650
Right, this race will start
at precisely 7am

23:18.650 --> 23:20.130
tomorrow morning.

23:20.130 --> 23:21.690
- Beer? - Yes, beer.

23:28.250 --> 23:31.770
OK, pre-flight check. Complete.

23:32.890 --> 23:37.050
There is the boat, soon it will be
pointing in the correct direction.

23:37.050 --> 23:39.210
And the race will begin.

23:39.210 --> 23:42.370
'Eventually the boat had done
its jiving and sheeting

23:42.370 --> 23:45.930
'and going about and all the crew
were at their stations.

23:49.010 --> 23:56.370
- 'And so, at precisely 7.11,
the race began.' - Three, two, one...

23:56.370 --> 23:59.690
HORN BLARES

23:59.690 --> 24:01.570
Go! Come on!

24:04.410 --> 24:06.690
We're racing, we are going.
Go, boys.

24:08.250 --> 24:09.610
Deploy whenever ready.

24:12.450 --> 24:13.890
Power!

24:17.610 --> 24:21.170
This is not simply
a race between a sailing boat

24:21.170 --> 24:22.930
and a little blue hatchback.

24:22.930 --> 24:25.370
I am on a mission from God,

24:25.370 --> 24:30.210
because the world has got it
into its head that wind power is

24:30.210 --> 24:33.050
the solution to everything,
and I just don't think it is.

24:34.690 --> 24:40.210
Wind is just annoying.
Internal combustion is good.

24:40.210 --> 24:43.370
'And at that moment, it looked
like I may have had a point.'

24:47.090 --> 24:51.130
- The wrong sail. - What?

24:51.130 --> 24:53.730
When you say the wrong sail,
where is the other sail?

24:53.730 --> 24:57.010
- It's right in front of us.
- In that bag?

24:57.010 --> 24:59.770
'With the sails having to be
swapped over quickly,

24:59.770 --> 25:03.210
'the crew got very shouty with me.'

25:03.210 --> 25:05.050
James, pull that rope.

25:07.210 --> 25:09.970
James, what are you doing there?
Get in and help.

25:09.970 --> 25:11.530
Ah!

25:11.530 --> 25:15.090
'The boat was stationary,
just 200 metres from the start line.

25:15.090 --> 25:17.530
'Things were looking good...
for Jeremy.'

25:20.090 --> 25:21.610
Oh, wow, big one.

25:23.530 --> 25:25.810
It was PJ O'Rourke,
the American author,

25:25.810 --> 25:29.810
who first noticed that hire cars
are the fastest cars in the world,

25:29.810 --> 25:32.490
and he is of course
completely correct.

25:34.930 --> 25:39.210
Because when was the last time you
took your car to the red line?

25:39.210 --> 25:43.210
Or you drove it flat out? Never.

25:43.210 --> 25:46.530
But here, in this now, yes,
because it isn't mine.

25:48.890 --> 25:50.410
Speed!

25:56.450 --> 25:58.530
'Back at sea, the new sail was up,

25:58.530 --> 26:01.170
'but we still weren't going
fast enough.'

26:03.050 --> 26:07.570
12 knots, which is
about 14mph in car terms.

26:07.570 --> 26:11.570
That's not bad, but at that rate,
it would take us 15 hours.

26:11.570 --> 26:13.490
That's no good.

26:13.490 --> 26:17.250
'Despite the gravel roads,
I was going quite a lot faster.'

26:21.250 --> 26:24.810
100km per hour right there,
into fourth.

26:28.530 --> 26:30.610
Maybe going a little too
fast there,

26:30.610 --> 26:32.610
but it's not my car so it
doesn't matter.

26:34.610 --> 26:37.250
I just feel so sorry for James
because he is on a boat, he is

26:37.250 --> 26:39.410
not going to see anything of
New Zealand,

26:39.410 --> 26:41.010
the prettiest country in the...

26:41.010 --> 26:42.970
world!

26:47.290 --> 26:49.130
I hit something.

26:53.130 --> 26:54.410
'After its wonky start,

26:54.410 --> 26:58.370
'the boat was finally starting
to stretch its legs.'

26:58.370 --> 27:02.090
How fast are we going?
25 knots, that's tremendous.

27:02.090 --> 27:04.250
We are about eight miles
from the shore

27:04.250 --> 27:08.010
so we have got 200 miles to run.

27:08.010 --> 27:11.770
'This speed, however,
did have its downsides.'

27:13.130 --> 27:15.010
Oh!

27:16.890 --> 27:18.930
What's my rank on this trip,
skipper?

27:18.930 --> 27:21.930
Am I the coxswain or the bosun
or Roger the cabin boy?

27:21.930 --> 27:24.410
- Right now, you're the cabin boy.
- Cabin boy.

27:25.850 --> 27:28.130
That would be all right
if you had a cabin.

27:29.890 --> 27:31.570
Its accident report form.

27:31.570 --> 27:34.370
"Was Avis vehicle
on correct side of the road?"

27:34.370 --> 27:37.810
Yes, I was.
"Explain how accident occurred."

27:37.810 --> 27:40.010
A maniac came the other way.

27:41.250 --> 27:44.610
"State who in your opinion was
responsible for the accident."

27:44.610 --> 27:47.730
Him! Him! He was mad.

27:47.730 --> 27:50.170
Right, onwards.

27:55.770 --> 27:58.610
OK, three, two, one, diving.

27:58.610 --> 28:01.130
Ooh! Ow!

28:02.850 --> 28:04.690
Come on, James, put some effort in.

28:09.250 --> 28:12.770
This is so catastrophically
uncomfortable as a way to travel.

28:18.810 --> 28:25.090
'The £65-a-day hire car and
the £700,000 boat hunkered down

28:25.090 --> 28:26.570
'and pressed on.'

28:36.810 --> 28:39.050
Tarmac, white lines.

28:48.730 --> 28:53.010
- We have covered 36 miles.
- 36? - Course is 310.

28:56.690 --> 29:02.610
'Imagining that I was well in the
lead, I pulled over to call James.'

29:02.610 --> 29:07.890
- Hello? - James May. - Yes, hello?
- What speed you doing?

29:07.890 --> 29:12.010
We have been cracking along at
23 knots plus at some points,

29:12.010 --> 29:13.930
it goes like Stig.

29:13.930 --> 29:18.290
23 knots, wow!
Is it exhausting?

29:18.290 --> 29:21.810
No, I want to say it's bloody
uncomfortable and unpleasant,

29:21.810 --> 29:25.010
but Sir Ben Ainslie is sitting next
to me, so I can't really say that.

29:25.010 --> 29:28.650
Can you congratulate him
for how good he was in both Gandhi

29:28.650 --> 29:30.330
and Sexy Beast?

29:31.370 --> 29:34.410
'At this point, the producers
showed me a tracking device that

29:34.410 --> 29:39.250
'revealed where James actually was.'
Oh, my giddy aunt!

29:39.250 --> 29:43.450
That can't be right. According to
this, you're miles ahead of me.

29:43.450 --> 29:46.890
- You still talking to me?
I can't hear you. - Holy cow!

29:46.890 --> 29:48.730
Get off the phone, I'm busy.

29:50.730 --> 29:51.810
Hello?

29:53.930 --> 29:58.210
'James was 170 miles from
the finish line, whereas I,

29:58.210 --> 30:00.770
'because of the unique
way New Zealand is shaped,

30:00.770 --> 30:05.770
'was still heading in the wrong
direction with 340 miles to go.'

30:08.930 --> 30:10.770
What if I lose this race, people?

30:10.770 --> 30:14.530
If you are campaigning now
to stop the government building

30:14.530 --> 30:17.730
2,500 windmills in your back garden
to provide you

30:17.730 --> 30:20.850
with enough electricity
for the pump in your fish tank

30:20.850 --> 30:24.210
and I lose this,
I can only apologise.

30:24.210 --> 30:26.810
I am trying to help you out here
but I'm losing.

30:28.490 --> 30:29.930
And I'm losing badly.

30:46.730 --> 30:48.490
I'm actually losing.

30:48.490 --> 30:50.330
And I don't like losing.

30:51.330 --> 30:57.250
No... That boat is like
being on a trampoline

30:57.250 --> 31:00.090
that's on a trampoline
while somebody throws buckets

31:00.090 --> 31:02.970
of salty water in your face and then
dries you off with a blowtorch.

31:02.970 --> 31:04.170
I know what you mean.

31:04.170 --> 31:06.530
On those gravel roads, the bumpiness
in that car.

31:06.530 --> 31:08.610
No, Jeremy, you don't know
what I mean.

31:08.610 --> 31:12.250
I just wanted to hit a mine,
I wanted it to be over.

31:12.250 --> 31:14.770
Well, we'll find out what happens
later on, OK?

31:14.770 --> 31:16.170
But now, it is time

31:16.170 --> 31:21.290
to introduce to you all
a brand-new reasonably priced car.

31:21.290 --> 31:22.970
The old Kia Cee'd has been retired,

31:22.970 --> 31:26.170
probably sold to a little old lady
as an ex-demonstrator.

31:26.170 --> 31:29.570
Low mileage.
And this is what shall replace it.

31:29.570 --> 31:31.570
This is a big moment,
ladies and gentlemen.

31:31.570 --> 31:33.170
The unveiling of what is, after all,

31:33.170 --> 31:36.250
only our fourth
Reasonably Priced Car.

31:36.250 --> 31:38.330
And so...

31:38.330 --> 31:41.170
What do you think of that? Yeah!

31:41.170 --> 31:43.130
APPLAUSE

31:43.130 --> 31:45.690
It's drawn applause
and I'm not surprised.

31:45.690 --> 31:49.450
Because, ladies and men, this is

31:49.450 --> 31:51.250
a Vauxhall Astra

31:51.250 --> 31:53.730
1.6 Tech Line,

31:53.730 --> 31:55.410
built in Britain

31:55.410 --> 31:58.970
and available for £17,345.

31:58.970 --> 32:02.810
That may not sound like particularly
good value

32:02.810 --> 32:06.090
but you need to know that
the Astra Tech Line...

32:06.090 --> 32:08.370
Remember to go into your local
radio voice here.

32:08.370 --> 32:11.650
..Comes with...

32:11.650 --> 32:13.570
IMPORTANT VOICE: A lifetime warranty.

32:13.570 --> 32:15.130
LAUGHTER

32:15.130 --> 32:16.770
Now think about that.

32:16.770 --> 32:18.130
If you're 17

32:18.130 --> 32:21.450
and you live to be 95 or even 100...

32:21.450 --> 32:22.650
- A-ha. - What?

32:22.650 --> 32:24.850
No, it's the lifetime of the car.

32:24.850 --> 32:26.930
Not the owner. It's different.

32:26.930 --> 32:28.330
LAUGHTER

32:28.330 --> 32:29.770
The car?!

32:29.770 --> 32:31.730
It depends how long the car lives.

32:31.730 --> 32:33.170
It's going to be a lot shorter.

32:33.170 --> 32:36.010
- I don't know, it could be
a long-lived car. - Well, whatever,

32:36.010 --> 32:38.170
we decided to launch it

32:38.170 --> 32:39.930
with a star-studded party.

32:44.330 --> 32:46.610
'We arrived at the track bright
and early

32:46.610 --> 32:50.730
'so we could set up the catering
and the hospitality.

32:50.730 --> 32:54.450
'And soon everything was ready
for our distinguished guests.'

32:54.450 --> 32:57.530
We have invited literally everybody

32:57.530 --> 32:59.570
from the world of celebrity.

32:59.570 --> 33:03.050
President Carter, Arnold
Schwarzenegger, Moira Stuart.

33:03.050 --> 33:06.170
I've invited just for you,
cos I know you like her,

33:06.170 --> 33:08.210
Joss Stone.

33:08.210 --> 33:09.490
Really?!

33:09.490 --> 33:10.570
Yes!

33:10.570 --> 33:12.410
You'll be rubbish with her.

33:12.410 --> 33:15.930
Hammond is literally the world's
worst human being at small talk.

33:15.930 --> 33:19.050
"Joss, would you like a teabag?"
See, I can do it.

33:19.050 --> 33:21.410
Small talk's really easy, Hammond.

33:21.410 --> 33:23.210
You just be
interested in somebody else.

33:23.210 --> 33:24.890
That's where it falls down, you see.

33:24.890 --> 33:27.570
- You want to know where
do their kids go to school. - Why?

33:27.570 --> 33:29.730
- Where do they live? - Why?

33:31.250 --> 33:33.650
'My lesson in small talk was
interrupted

33:33.650 --> 33:35.810
'by the arrival of our first guest -

33:35.810 --> 33:37.450
'Brian Johnson out of AC/DC.'

33:40.090 --> 33:42.850
Good to see you, me son,
are you all right?

33:42.850 --> 33:44.450
How are you, mate, are you well?

33:44.450 --> 33:46.450
I'm doing good.
Richard, me bonny lad.

33:46.450 --> 33:48.490
Nice to see you. How are you?

33:48.490 --> 33:51.650
I'm fit as a butcher's dog.
And you've got a new car?

33:51.650 --> 33:53.810
Yeah, you are the very first person

33:53.810 --> 33:57.570
to drive the new
Vauxhall Astra Tech Line.

33:57.570 --> 34:00.410
'Since this was the maiden
voyage for our new car,

34:00.410 --> 34:03.290
'we decided to give it
a bit of a send-off.'

34:03.290 --> 34:05.250
This is it.

34:05.250 --> 34:07.410
Proud moment.

34:07.410 --> 34:09.530
A new reasonably priced car.

34:09.530 --> 34:12.409
We'll cut the ribbon,
thanks to Brian Johnson!

34:12.409 --> 34:16.090
In...three, two, one - GO!

34:20.010 --> 34:22.170
It's got stuck in the car.

34:22.170 --> 34:23.650
You stupid idiot!

34:23.650 --> 34:26.090
- What tape have you used?
- It didn't cut it.

34:26.090 --> 34:27.969
What happened? Sorry, Brian.

34:27.969 --> 34:29.690
You back up, Brian.

34:29.690 --> 34:31.730
Edit this out.

34:31.730 --> 34:35.409
In three, two, one...GO!

34:38.090 --> 34:40.570
OK, come on, little boy.

34:40.570 --> 34:42.770
Let's get this
little puppy round it.

34:42.770 --> 34:45.690
'Whilst Brian pounded
round the track...

34:48.250 --> 34:49.730
'..our next guest arrived.

34:49.730 --> 34:52.290
'Charles Dance
out of Game Of Thrones.'

34:52.290 --> 34:55.650
Where's the other one,
the third member of your team?

34:55.650 --> 34:57.970
He doesn't come down.
He's interested mostly

34:57.970 --> 35:00.770
in classical harpsichord music,
rather than...

35:00.770 --> 35:03.970
- Richard, that's disgusting coffee.
- It is, thank you. (BLEEP) - horrible.

35:03.970 --> 35:05.290
Thank you.

35:07.650 --> 35:10.410
Come on, you (BLEEP BLEEP).

35:11.730 --> 35:13.890
'With Brian busy enjoying himself,

35:13.890 --> 35:16.690
'I had plenty of time to
quiz Tywin Lannister

35:16.690 --> 35:19.090
'about my favourite programme.'

35:19.090 --> 35:21.090
I assumed that you'd be with

35:21.090 --> 35:24.090
Tyrion Lannister and Lena Headey.

35:24.090 --> 35:26.250
Who else? Oh, Sansa.

35:26.250 --> 35:28.970
You have literally no idea what
we're talking about, do you?

35:28.970 --> 35:30.650
Have you not watched it, Richard?

35:30.650 --> 35:32.090
- Yes! - You have? - No.

35:32.090 --> 35:36.170
'Before Richard could make any more
conversational errors,

35:36.170 --> 35:38.690
'Brian came back to see
how he'd got on.'

35:38.690 --> 35:41.450
When you were last
here in the Chevrolet Lacetti,

35:41.450 --> 35:43.970
you did a 145.9.

35:43.970 --> 35:45.250
Right.

35:45.250 --> 35:47.330
In the Vauxhall Astra Tech Line...

35:47.330 --> 35:48.970
With lifetime warranty.

35:48.970 --> 35:53.370
..145.1.

35:53.370 --> 35:54.850
Brilliant.

35:54.850 --> 35:58.130
You're faster than you were before.

36:00.650 --> 36:02.210
There. Yeah.

36:02.210 --> 36:04.570
Brian Johnson...

36:04.570 --> 36:07.450
He doesn't know what to say.

36:07.450 --> 36:09.850
'With a target to aim for,

36:09.850 --> 36:11.890
'the hand of the king set off.'

36:11.890 --> 36:14.010
OK. Come on, Charlie.

36:14.010 --> 36:16.650
'And whilst he was on the track,

36:16.650 --> 36:18.450
'one of Hammond's guests arrived.

36:18.450 --> 36:20.690
'Actor Warwick Davis.'

36:20.690 --> 36:23.810
- Hello. - Hi, Jeremy. - How are you?
- Good, thank you. How are you?

36:23.810 --> 36:25.770
Very well.

36:25.770 --> 36:27.330
Pedals.

36:27.330 --> 36:30.170
It's my extension pedals.
For the car.

36:30.170 --> 36:34.090
They go on the car. You don't
have something like this?
No, but I like the look of them.

36:34.090 --> 36:35.330
You have only got two.

36:35.330 --> 36:38.770
That's all you need, isn't it?
Brake and accelerator.

36:38.770 --> 36:40.570
For an automatic, yeah. It's manual.

36:43.570 --> 36:46.530
Erm, we'll improvise.

36:50.010 --> 36:51.970
Nearly nobbled a cameraman.

36:53.330 --> 36:55.050
'Once Tywin had finished,

36:55.050 --> 36:58.370
'and we had his time
on the lap board...'

36:58.370 --> 37:00.810
- 140... - Oh, heavens above! - ..Eight...

37:00.810 --> 37:04.250
- Oh! - Point eight.

37:04.250 --> 37:07.970
'Hammond and Warwick set off to make
an extended clutch pedal.'

37:07.970 --> 37:09.690
I was going to do that.

37:09.690 --> 37:12.850
He's brought two pedals down.

37:12.850 --> 37:17.410
- But it's a manual. - Oh, problem!

37:17.410 --> 37:19.170
- Yeah. - Problem.

37:19.170 --> 37:23.530
I need to set a good lap time
and how can I if this sort of
disintegrates. "Is that his excuse?

37:23.530 --> 37:26.930
"It wasn't a very good time
because his clutch pedal..."

37:26.930 --> 37:29.370
I'm not trying to give you
excuses, I'm trying to give you

37:29.370 --> 37:30.970
a chance.

37:30.970 --> 37:34.370
Let me sit in there and push that.
Let me push the Pringles.

37:35.370 --> 37:39.170
- OK. - Obviously, we need some sort
of... - Oh, hell.

37:42.130 --> 37:44.010
I'm pretty low down here.

37:44.010 --> 37:47.650
Let's see, for argument's sake,
if this is strong enough.

37:49.490 --> 37:51.330
- It is strong enough. - Yeah.

37:51.330 --> 37:54.730
But I'm having to sort of steady
it with my foot.

37:54.730 --> 37:56.810
You are doing very well.

37:56.810 --> 38:00.090
'Eventually,
after much experimenting...'

38:00.090 --> 38:03.810
- More bread, yeah?
- That goes behind you.

38:03.810 --> 38:05.850
I'm still too low.

38:06.970 --> 38:08.970
'Warwick set off on his timed laps.'

38:09.970 --> 38:11.490
- I can't get in gear. - BLEEP!

38:13.130 --> 38:16.090
'Unfortunately, I couldn't be there
to support him

38:16.090 --> 38:18.250
'because I'd been distracted.'

38:18.250 --> 38:21.090
- This is Richard. - Hello, Richard.
- He fancies you.

38:21.090 --> 38:22.570
Nice to meet you!

38:22.570 --> 38:25.170
- I have a badge for you here.
What's that? - That's your badge.

38:25.170 --> 38:27.810
Oh, good, just in case. Put that on.

38:27.810 --> 38:31.610
- Right, good.
- I'll leave the two of you alone. - OK.
- Just to get to know each other.

38:31.610 --> 38:34.010
I can entertain you
with my small talk. OK.

38:34.010 --> 38:36.010
His small talk's not very good.

38:36.010 --> 38:40.450
- 'Completely oblivious to
Warwick's peril...' - Oh, God!

38:40.450 --> 38:42.970
Oh, bloody hell! Oh!

38:42.970 --> 38:45.210
CAR SKIDS

38:45.210 --> 38:51.490
'Mr Smalltalk had completely
forgotten not go on about himself.'

38:51.490 --> 38:55.450
The important thing is not to panic,
cos everyone thinks helicopters

38:55.450 --> 38:58.730
will just fall out the sky if the
engine fails. They won't. Right.

38:58.730 --> 39:01.490
I've had to land
a couple of times for things.

39:01.490 --> 39:03.610
Without engines? Yup.

39:03.610 --> 39:05.250
Lot of skill involved.

39:07.090 --> 39:11.170
You have to be good. There's only so
many people have helicopter licences.

39:14.890 --> 39:16.410
Oh, God! AH!

39:16.410 --> 39:19.410
Hell, bloody hell! Ooh!

39:19.410 --> 39:22.530
'As Warwick went off yet again,
Jimmy Carr arrived.'

39:22.530 --> 39:24.570
You all right?
Very well, how are you?

39:24.570 --> 39:25.770
Very nice to see you.

39:25.770 --> 39:28.970
It has your name on it. Lovely.
That, my friend, is teeth whitening.

39:28.970 --> 39:32.450
- I don't know what you've had done.
- Oh! - That's how that's done.

39:34.650 --> 39:37.890
Hot on Jimmy's heels was world
heavyweight champion David Haye,

39:37.890 --> 39:40.290
who made a beeline
for the boxing machine.

39:42.290 --> 39:43.330
Ooh!

39:43.330 --> 39:45.370
Oh, no!

39:47.570 --> 39:48.770
What does it say?

39:48.770 --> 39:51.650
A new record, ladies and gentlemen,
thank you very much. Well done!

39:51.650 --> 39:54.410
'With Richard sulking
at the attention David was

39:54.410 --> 39:57.250
'getting from Joss, I had a go.'

39:57.250 --> 39:59.010
Oh!

39:59.010 --> 40:03.410
You styled out,
you looked totally cool.

40:05.010 --> 40:06.050
Yes!

40:06.050 --> 40:10.730
'Having finally mastered Hammond's
terrible DIY, Warwick had

40:10.730 --> 40:13.090
'managed to bang in a lap time.'

40:13.090 --> 40:16.210
You did it in 140...

40:17.330 --> 40:18.730
Six!

40:18.730 --> 40:20.650
Oh!

40:20.650 --> 40:23.690
- Slap bang in the middle.
- Pleased with that?

40:23.690 --> 40:26.410
You are faster than
the hand of the king.

Rachel Riley off Countdown.

40:41.810 --> 40:43.570
Wasn't expecting that. Hello!

40:43.570 --> 40:45.850
- Hello! - I'm Jeremy. - I'm Rachel.

40:45.850 --> 40:48.250
- Good to meet you, how are you?
- Good, thank you.

40:48.250 --> 40:50.330
- Can I get you anything?
- Hi, Rachel, I'm Richard.

40:50.330 --> 40:52.730
Richard Hammond is extremely
busy at the moment.

40:52.730 --> 40:54.130
I'm going over here.

40:54.130 --> 40:58.690

she claimed she was a vegetarian.

her some fish.'

I just need to come in here.

41:03.330 --> 41:04.690
You really are squeezing in.

41:04.690 --> 41:07.730
- I know, I just need to come in.
Do you like sushi? - I love sushi.

41:07.730 --> 41:10.130
Excellent, I'll just...

41:10.130 --> 41:12.490
- Shall I...? - Brilliant.

41:12.490 --> 41:14.770
- Are you a trained sushi chef? - Yeah.

41:14.770 --> 41:17.210
I've got soy sauce all over me.

41:17.210 --> 41:18.570
Yeah, you have.

41:18.570 --> 41:20.170
Sorry, Richard.

41:20.170 --> 41:22.650
'Making the sushi required
a lot of care.'

41:23.770 --> 41:25.050
There we go.

41:25.050 --> 41:27.530
'But the results were worth it.'

41:29.570 --> 41:31.170
Yes.

41:33.010 --> 41:35.050
It's like a bush tucker trial, this.

41:36.930 --> 41:40.210
Do not brake on this corner!
OK... Argh!

41:40.210 --> 41:44.530

Ten years, we've done this show.

41:47.770 --> 41:50.170
- Yup. - How many times have you
done that? - Loads.

41:50.170 --> 41:53.130
- Never. - I often do
this bit of the show.

41:53.130 --> 41:54.570
Go on, then.

41:54.570 --> 41:58.330
Joss, I have your time
written down over here.

41:58.330 --> 42:00.490
For his sake,
I hope it's not the fastest time

42:00.490 --> 42:02.490

up there, is he?

42:02.490 --> 42:04.250
Oh, from you(!)

THEY LAUGH

42:06.450 --> 42:08.450
I love it!

42:08.450 --> 42:09.890
Nice(!)

42:09.890 --> 42:11.210
Even from Warwick.

42:11.210 --> 42:14.010
You want to beat
the man from that thing.

42:14.010 --> 42:17.170
- The hand of the king.
- That's the fella.

42:17.170 --> 42:19.690
- Right.
- How fast did she do it?

42:19.690 --> 42:20.970
I'm getting to it!

42:20.970 --> 42:23.130
How fast did Joss do it?

42:23.130 --> 42:26.010
HE did it in 1.48 -
it says on the bloody board!

42:26.010 --> 42:28.290
1.48.8

42:28.290 --> 42:30.170

Oh!

Oh, God!

42:36.770 --> 42:39.490
Don't say "nine".

42:39.490 --> 42:40.770
Nine!

42:40.770 --> 42:42.930
Oh, no!

42:42.930 --> 42:44.130
Oh, shit!

42:44.130 --> 42:45.970
Get out of that one, Hammond.

42:45.970 --> 42:47.850
Oh, no, that's so sad!

42:47.850 --> 42:50.850
No, Joss, that was... Oh.

Look who it is.

43:04.490 --> 43:06.130
Who's that?

43:06.130 --> 43:09.290
Mike Rutherford, out of Genesis.

43:09.290 --> 43:11.090
Hammond. Hammond?

43:11.090 --> 43:12.970
Hammond?!

43:12.970 --> 43:14.530
Hammond?! Mike!

43:14.530 --> 43:16.970
- How are you? - Very well. How are you?
- I'm very good.

43:16.970 --> 43:19.010
- It's good to see you.
- Where's the team?

43:19.010 --> 43:21.090
- Where's Richard? - Richard?

43:21.090 --> 43:24.370
Yeah. That's odd. He was here
a minute ago.

You did 146.8. David Haye,

43:49.050 --> 43:50.410

ALL: Oh!

43:52.650 --> 43:54.290
Put it there.

out in the car...'

'..Hammond suddenly re-emerged.'

44:07.490 --> 44:08.930
Where have you been?!

44:08.930 --> 44:10.330
I had something to do.

44:10.330 --> 44:13.090
If you're just hiding from him,
he's one of the nicest people...

44:13.090 --> 44:15.690
- Is he not one of the nicest men...?
- He is really sweet.

44:15.690 --> 44:17.970
He's one of the
top-three guys in Genesis.

44:17.970 --> 44:19.970
I want to know
if Mike can do a lap faster...

44:19.970 --> 44:23.090
- Than one of his tracks. - No!

44:23.090 --> 44:25.650
- No! - Sorry.

..till Jeremy joined in.

KEYBOARD AND DRUM MACHINE PLAY

it on the road that will help.

Grass on the front.

- ..with these... - Thank you very much.

45:52.930 --> 45:55.130
You know the middle pedal?

45:55.130 --> 45:57.410
- There's the clutch
and the accelerator. - Yes.

45:57.410 --> 45:58.930
There's one in-between them.

45:58.930 --> 46:00.130
I know, the footrest.

46:00.130 --> 46:02.130
One day, we've had that, Jimmy!

46:02.130 --> 46:03.530
Do we have a jack?

46:03.530 --> 46:05.650
Warwick, you can lift things, right?

46:05.650 --> 46:07.970
I don't know what super powers
you people have,

46:07.970 --> 46:09.490
but can you lift it?

46:09.490 --> 46:11.210
THEY LAUGH

46:11.210 --> 46:13.730
You just referred to me as a "jack".

over to the lap board.'

Where do you think you've come?

46:22.490 --> 46:24.410
I imagine I've beaten him.

46:24.410 --> 46:26.450
I know he does
a lot of racing in his spare time.

46:26.450 --> 46:29.130
It's his hobby, but I think natural
ability...tough to beat.

46:29.130 --> 46:31.730
145.1 to beat.

46:31.730 --> 46:34.570
You did...

46:34.570 --> 46:37.410
145.6.

46:37.410 --> 46:40.530
That's very well done.

46:40.530 --> 46:42.170
It's cost a car!

shot at impressing Joss.'

46:55.130 --> 46:56.690
Ready? Yeah.

46:56.690 --> 46:58.610
That's OK, it's fine.

46:58.610 --> 47:00.770
I can do it faster.

47:00.770 --> 47:04.090
I can do this... Oh!
This is brilliant.

47:04.090 --> 47:06.650
I just wanted to check that was OK.

47:06.650 --> 47:10.210
You didn't last very long.
I did this on a real sheep once.

Joss decided to leave.

no point in staying, either.

TYRES SCREECH

47:31.850 --> 47:33.370

47:37.050 --> 47:40.770
Definitely in this section.
Definitely in this section.

47:40.770 --> 47:42.490
You did it, actually,

47:42.490 --> 47:47.490
in 1.48.5,

47:47.490 --> 47:48.970
so actually, there you are,

47:48.970 --> 47:52.050
- faster than the Hand of the King.
- Fastest woman!

47:52.050 --> 47:56.210
Whoo! I need something to calm down,
some kind of sedative.

the track in my helicopter.'

APPLAUSE

48:14.090 --> 48:16.730
And there it is,
the reasonably priced car,

48:16.730 --> 48:19.050
launched and ready for action!

48:21.330 --> 48:24.290
Anyway,
tonight we are having a race,

48:24.290 --> 48:27.570
up the side of New Zealand
from here to here.

48:27.570 --> 48:30.930
Yep, it's James in
a £700,000 boat versus me

48:30.930 --> 48:36.330
in the fastest car in the world,
a £65-a-day rented hatchback.

48:36.330 --> 48:39.090
When we left the action, I was here,

48:39.090 --> 48:40.770
and Jeremy was here.

48:40.770 --> 48:43.090
So I was winning.

48:43.090 --> 48:45.650
But I was very miserable.

49:01.450 --> 49:03.050
All power, hire car!

49:07.050 --> 49:08.890
Splash the caravan.

'Onboard HMS Misery,
life wasn't getting any better.'

49:18.330 --> 49:21.810
This is what I get to eat on the
boat. A melted bar of chocolate...

49:25.090 --> 49:27.970
- ..and a bag of - BLEEP - nuts, and
you'll have to bleep that word.

49:29.530 --> 49:34.970

now I was on tarmac roads,
was much more comfortable.'

this is bloody madness, mate.

52:04.210 --> 52:06.690
It's not too good at the moment.

52:08.490 --> 52:11.970
We've never sailed these things
in these conditions before.

52:11.970 --> 52:13.810
Now you tell me.

52:13.810 --> 52:17.690
29 degrees, if we do go in,
you have to hang on,

52:17.690 --> 52:20.370
because you're going to be
breaking bones.

52:20.370 --> 52:23.490
So really, James, the best thing
for you to do, mate, is hang on.

52:23.490 --> 52:24.730
Thank you.

52:26.570 --> 52:28.050
'In the little blue hatchback,

52:28.050 --> 52:31.570
'the news from the GPS
tracking device was encouraging.'

52:33.930 --> 52:41.290
James May is now only 67 miles
ahead. I'm catching him.

52:42.770 --> 52:46.570
But am I catching him fast enough?
That's the big question.

52:48.010 --> 52:50.850
'I decided to take a shortcut,

52:50.850 --> 52:52.970
'even though it would mean
leaving the tarmac

52:52.970 --> 52:55.650
'and using gravel roads instead.'

53:00.850 --> 53:03.290
This is going to save me 20 miles.

53:08.090 --> 53:09.370
Yeah!

53:11.570 --> 53:16.010
'My plan was working well,
but then the gravel ran out.'

53:16.010 --> 53:19.370
There's no track! Oh!

53:24.050 --> 53:25.570
BLEEP!

53:28.530 --> 53:32.210
I wouldn't do this in my Mercedes,
put it like that.

53:34.450 --> 53:38.770
Oh, dear! I've run into the white
cliffs of Dover, literally.

53:39.930 --> 53:42.290
'Still, could be worse.'

53:51.210 --> 53:54.530
- Sir Ben Ainslie, sir? - Yes.

53:54.530 --> 53:56.370
Please don't take this personally,

53:56.370 --> 53:58.770
but this is bloody purgatory!

53:58.770 --> 54:00.850
Can you imagine... Ow!

54:04.410 --> 54:06.610
'Meanwhile, I'd found a track.'

54:08.090 --> 54:11.970
This must take me back to the road.

54:13.530 --> 54:14.970
Oh, my God! Tractor!

54:16.410 --> 54:18.410
Ugh!

54:22.810 --> 54:25.130
- Sir Ben Ainslie, sir? - Yes!

54:25.130 --> 54:27.970
What happens if you need
a slash on this boat?

54:27.970 --> 54:33.290
- I think there's a bucket somewhere.
- Right. I might just piss myself.

54:36.450 --> 54:38.090
What is the point of sailing?

54:39.650 --> 54:42.650
'The track had indeed taken me
back to the road,

54:42.650 --> 54:44.610
'but the accident with
the tractor meant

54:44.610 --> 54:48.210
'I was no longer driving
the fastest car in the world.'

54:48.210 --> 54:50.890
CAR RATTLES

54:54.850 --> 54:56.970
The noise is not good.

54:58.210 --> 54:59.450
It's not going to make it.

54:59.450 --> 55:02.010
It just is not going to make it.

55:02.010 --> 55:05.450
'So there was only one thing
for it.'

55:07.130 --> 55:11.490
- Hi. - Good afternoon. - I've got
a small problem with my car.

55:11.490 --> 55:13.490
There was a maniacal tractor driver

55:13.490 --> 55:16.250
who was doing 70 kilometres an hour,
I swerved...

55:17.410 --> 55:21.170
'In a jiffy, the helpful hire car
lady had me back in the race.'

55:23.210 --> 55:25.330
Now, in one important respect,

55:25.330 --> 55:29.130
this car is not the same
as the one I started out with.

55:32.250 --> 55:33.690
But at the finish line,

55:33.690 --> 55:37.770
I suspect James will be so exhausted
he won't notice...

55:39.250 --> 55:43.290
..that I set off with a blue car
and ended up with a red one.

55:44.970 --> 55:49.690
'And anyway, right now, I had bigger
issues, because I was 100 miles

55:49.690 --> 55:54.010
'from the finish line and James
was only 50 miles away.

55:54.010 --> 55:57.490
'To win, then,
I'd have to go twice as fast.

56:00.530 --> 56:04.010
Nice, guv! Lovely work.

56:05.610 --> 56:08.650
Stay vigilant, though, boys!
Stay on it!

56:08.650 --> 56:12.250
- Jeremy, where is he?
- No idea. No comms.

56:14.610 --> 56:18.890
Come on! We've got the fastest car
in the world, now use it.

56:25.850 --> 56:27.850
23 knots.

56:27.850 --> 56:31.930
OK! Three, two, one! Diving!

56:35.250 --> 56:39.770
Come on, James, give us a hand!
It's not a bloody love boat.

56:44.770 --> 56:46.810
Come on, Jeremy,
concentrate, concentrate.

56:48.170 --> 56:51.170
Make every corner as crisp
as you can. Come on!

57:00.010 --> 57:01.650
Just ticked over nine hours.

57:03.690 --> 57:05.490
I'm so sick of this.

57:07.570 --> 57:10.250
'What I really needed was
a road with no corners.

57:12.930 --> 57:15.490
'And thanks to this
wonderful country,

57:15.490 --> 57:17.530
'that's exactly what I found.'

57:20.930 --> 57:22.930
Yeeha!

57:26.050 --> 57:32.610
This is called Ninety Mile Beach,
because it is exactly 55 miles long.

57:32.610 --> 57:35.290
I don't understand that, either.

57:37.170 --> 57:39.530
What I do know and I do understand,

57:39.530 --> 57:42.570
is that it is genuinely
a public highway.

57:42.570 --> 57:44.010
It's a road.

57:48.090 --> 57:54.130
No traffic, no corners,
James May, you have had it.

58:06.650 --> 58:11.050
'In the boat, we were about to go
round the very top of New Zealand.'

58:15.570 --> 58:17.170
That is the cape there.

58:17.170 --> 58:20.050
Once we've rounded that,
we think we'll have wind

58:20.050 --> 58:22.770
and a bit of tide with us,
the water will be flat,

58:22.770 --> 58:25.290
then we've got about ten miles
of pleasant sailing,

58:25.290 --> 58:28.090
like in Howards' Way.

58:29.850 --> 58:31.690
It can't come soon enough.

58:33.890 --> 58:35.250
Gah!

58:35.250 --> 58:36.810
Jesus.

58:42.250 --> 58:43.330
Bit wobbly there.

58:46.770 --> 58:50.210
Boys, just stay vigilant
for this last six or seven miles.

58:50.210 --> 58:51.650
Not far to go.

58:58.890 --> 59:01.970
'I was now off Ninety Mile Beach.'

59:03.370 --> 59:05.690
Back on gravel.
I wasn't expecting that.

59:11.330 --> 59:14.970
Come on, small red hatchback,
whatever you are.

59:16.850 --> 59:23.330
I'm doing this now to uphold
the honour of coal, gas and oil,

59:23.330 --> 59:25.570
the cornerstones of civilisation.

59:30.050 --> 59:31.730
- Is that our beach there? - Yeah.

59:32.850 --> 59:36.690
'The finish line was a chequered
flag at the water's edge,

59:36.690 --> 59:39.250
'but to make my day
even more miserable,

59:39.250 --> 59:43.130
'Sir Ben announced that the boat
couldn't actually get there.'

59:43.130 --> 59:47.570
- You're going to have to jump off and
swim ashore. - What? You're joking!

59:51.050 --> 59:53.810
There's now only five miles to go.

59:57.250 --> 59:58.290
OK, James.

01:00:01.570 --> 01:00:04.570
Don't lose it now.
Do not lose it now!

01:00:06.130 --> 01:00:08.610
Go for it, James! Swim!

01:00:17.170 --> 01:00:18.250
Come on!

01:00:29.570 --> 01:00:31.610
CAR CLATTERS AND REVS

01:00:31.610 --> 01:00:33.650
No! No!

01:00:35.530 --> 01:00:37.130
Come on! Please!

01:00:44.090 --> 01:00:47.690
Have I won? Have I won?
Have I won?

01:00:47.690 --> 01:00:51.850
Man in heaven! Oh, God!

01:00:51.850 --> 01:00:54.890
THEY CHEER

01:00:56.810 --> 01:00:59.010
Holy cow, have you seen your face?

01:01:00.170 --> 01:01:04.210
I was just about to conclude
and say, we must now close down

01:01:04.210 --> 01:01:07.410
all coal and gas-powered
power stations

01:01:07.410 --> 01:01:09.290
and switch immediately
to wind power,

01:01:09.290 --> 01:01:13.010
because obviously it's better.
But look what it does to you!

01:01:13.010 --> 01:01:17.530
It's brought me out in boils
and sores and blindness.

01:01:17.530 --> 01:01:20.690
Did you have to use
any of your insurance waiver forms?

01:01:20.690 --> 01:01:23.930
No, none at all. The car got here
without a single scratch.

01:01:27.170 --> 01:01:31.690
- It was blue when you set off.
- It wasn't. - Wasn't it? It was blue!

01:01:31.690 --> 01:01:34.250
- I would have sworn it was blue.
- It was red...

01:01:34.250 --> 01:01:36.690
APPLAUSE

01:01:36.690 --> 01:01:39.330
Well done, James May.

01:01:41.130 --> 01:01:47.530
- Can I just say, that boat, the
boat... - Oh, God, he's moaning again!

01:01:47.530 --> 01:01:52.690
But listen, it's £700,000, OK?
You don't get a cabin.

01:01:52.690 --> 01:01:57.450
You don't even get a chair or
a table or a radio or even a floor.

01:01:57.450 --> 01:02:02.490
- Yes, but James, you won.
- I didn't win, Hammond, the crew won.

01:02:02.490 --> 01:02:05.570
All I did was not fall off
for 12 hours.

01:02:05.570 --> 01:02:09.090
Well, anyway, the conclusion is that
wind power is obviously great,

01:02:09.090 --> 01:02:12.810
but it does give you a face
like a prostitute's front door.

01:02:12.810 --> 01:02:15.250
LAUGHTER

01:02:15.250 --> 01:02:17.690
And on that bombshell,
it is time to end.

01:02:17.690 --> 01:02:20.810
Thank you so much for watching.
See you next week. Good night.

01:02:20.810 --> 01:02:24.850
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE
