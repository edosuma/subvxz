01:12.400 --> 01:13.959
Joe, what are you doing?

01:15.120 --> 01:16.120
I'm hungry.

01:16.320 --> 01:18.676
Don't eat sugar. It will keep you awake.

01:24.960 --> 01:26.633
If this thing doesn't happen,

01:27.360 --> 01:29.520
I don't want to be around
for the sympathy calls, okay?

01:29.600 --> 01:32.354
So what we're gonna do,
we're gonna get out of here.

01:33.520 --> 01:37.355
We're gonna rent a cabin in Maine,
stare at a fire.

01:38.360 --> 01:39.840
That sounds cheerful.

02:05.600 --> 02:07.831
- Don't.
- Don't what?

02:07.920 --> 02:12.119
Don't pretend you're interested in sex
just because you're climbing the walls.

02:12.200 --> 02:14.317
Come on, just a quickie.

02:14.400 --> 02:16.551
- It will help us sleep.
- I was asleep.

02:16.640 --> 02:18.950
Well, you shouldn't be.
It's not natural.

02:21.600 --> 02:24.513
Come on. You don't have to do anything.
Just lie there.

02:24.760 --> 02:26.399
Oh, God.

02:26.480 --> 02:29.757
- Joe, this is pathetic.
- Yeah. Pathetic.

02:30.320 --> 02:32.551
In the real sense of the word. Pathos...

02:33.920 --> 02:35.036
Eros.

02:36.800 --> 02:38.712
Okay, fine. Go ahead.

02:44.840 --> 02:46.957
Just imagine I'm some young,

02:47.160 --> 02:50.437
inarticulate stud who's found you
lying naked on the beach.

02:53.240 --> 02:55.072
His big hand is tan,

02:57.840 --> 02:59.479
blond knuckle hair,

03:02.680 --> 03:05.195
his middle finger gently probing...

03:13.000 --> 03:16.994
Now he takes out his huge, swaying

03:18.800 --> 03:21.315
tumescent cock.

03:21.400 --> 03:24.040
Oh, God, Joe, enough!

03:33.800 --> 03:35.029
Hello?

03:35.280 --> 03:36.316
<i>Hello?</i>

03:36.760 --> 03:39.036
<i>Am I speaking to Mr. Joseph Castleman?</i>

03:39.280 --> 03:40.953
Yes.

03:42.200 --> 03:44.317
<i>This is Mr. Arvid Engdahl calling</i>

03:44.440 --> 03:47.080
<i>from the Nobel Foundation
in Stockholm, Sweden.</i>

03:50.880 --> 03:52.837
This is not a joke, I take it?

03:53.440 --> 03:56.160
<i>No, Mr. Castleman, I assure you.</i>

03:56.360 --> 03:58.397
<i>If you like I will give you
the phone number here,</i>

03:58.480 --> 03:59.480
<i>and you can call back.</i>

03:59.560 --> 04:02.314
No, that won't be necessary, thank you.

04:02.400 --> 04:03.436
Oh, my God!

04:03.680 --> 04:05.353
Listen, before you go on,

04:05.440 --> 04:08.592
I'd like my wife
to get on the extension.

04:08.680 --> 04:11.639
- Would that be all right?
<i>- Yes, of course, I'll wait.</i>

04:17.519 --> 04:18.874
Oh, God.

04:20.720 --> 04:22.120
Hello? I'm on.

04:22.240 --> 04:24.675
<i>- Hello, Mrs. Castleman. Is that you?</i>
- Yes.

04:24.760 --> 04:26.479
<i>Mr. Castleman, are you still on as well?</i>

04:26.640 --> 04:27.994
Yes, I am.

04:28.440 --> 04:31.751
<i>It is my great honor and pleasure
to tell you, Mr. Castleman,</i>

04:31.840 --> 04:36.596
<i>that you have been chosen to receive
this year's Nobel Prize in literature.</i>

04:38.880 --> 04:40.439
<i>Thank you.</i>

04:40.520 --> 04:41.556
Thank you very much.

04:41.640 --> 04:45.680
<i>Mr. Castleman, we are so delighted
to be giving you this prize.</i>

04:45.960 --> 04:48.759
<i>Your career has
a truly remarkable span to it.</i>

04:48.840 --> 04:49.956
<i>Not only do you write</i>

04:50.040 --> 04:52.236
<i>with extraordinary intimacy,
wit and depth,</i>

04:52.320 --> 04:54.994
<i>you have also challenged
the novelistic form in ways</i>

04:55.080 --> 04:57.993
<i>that will affect generations
of writers to come.</i>

04:58.440 --> 05:02.719
Well, I should be getting something
for all the gray in my beard.

05:03.440 --> 05:04.669
<i>Indeed, yes.</i>

05:05.080 --> 05:08.152
<i>And thank you for doing so
on the world's behalf.</i>

05:08.520 --> 05:09.636
<i>Mrs. Castleman.</i>

05:10.280 --> 05:11.396
Yes.

05:11.640 --> 05:14.758
<i>You should know that your husband
will be fending off the press today,</i>

05:14.840 --> 05:17.799
<i>so what I advise is that
you monitor his calls,</i>

05:17.920 --> 05:19.559
<i>as it does get quite exhausting.</i>

05:20.520 --> 05:23.354
Yes, I'll take good care of him.

05:23.840 --> 05:27.470
<i>Mr. Castleman, I'm sure you would like
to make a few calls of your own,</i>

05:27.560 --> 05:29.438
<i>so I shall leave you
to your celebration.</i>

05:29.920 --> 05:32.640
<i>We will contact you later
with all the specifics.</i>

05:32.960 --> 05:35.634
<i>And, again, many congratulations to you.</i>

05:36.680 --> 05:37.716
Thank you.

05:38.120 --> 05:39.600
Thank you very much.

05:40.680 --> 05:42.797
<i>- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.</i>

05:43.120 --> 05:44.120
Goodbye.

05:45.000 --> 05:49.711
<i>I won the Nobel!</i>

05:52.360 --> 05:54.477
<i>I won the Nobel!</i>

05:54.560 --> 05:55.755
What?

05:58.240 --> 05:59.469
Joanie, I'm...

05:59.560 --> 06:02.280
- I'm just being silly.
- No, I gotta take a shower.

06:02.360 --> 06:04.033
We have a long day. Come on down.

06:04.440 --> 06:05.669
Come on.

06:05.920 --> 06:06.990
Joan.

06:08.680 --> 06:09.796
There.

06:29.400 --> 06:31.710
So you're going to Stockholm?

06:32.400 --> 06:34.232
- When?
- December.

06:34.880 --> 06:36.678
It'll be freezing there.

06:38.320 --> 06:40.835
- Joe buying you a fur?
- No.

06:41.000 --> 06:44.311
No, I think I'll be
like any decent First Lady

06:44.400 --> 06:46.153
and get by with a good cloth coat.

06:46.240 --> 06:48.550
Joanie, get over here. Come.

06:49.160 --> 06:51.994
- Hello, Hal.
- Hello, Joan.

06:52.760 --> 06:56.549
- You're looking lovely as always.
- Thank you, Hal. That's very sweet.

06:56.840 --> 06:59.196
- The <i>New York Times</i> is here.
- Really?

06:59.840 --> 07:00.876
Tell her.

07:01.120 --> 07:04.079
They're giving your husband
the cover of the Sunday <i>Magazine.</i>

07:04.160 --> 07:06.834
They're knocking out a story
about Bill Clinton for him.

07:07.120 --> 07:09.760
Is this going to be like
one of those Avedon shots?

07:09.880 --> 07:11.109
With all the pores showing?

07:11.240 --> 07:14.392
Every brilliant one of them, my friend.

07:16.160 --> 07:18.516
Oh, God, this is so unreal.

07:19.480 --> 07:21.517
- How do I look?
- You're fine.

07:21.760 --> 07:23.752
- No crumbs? Nose hairs?
- No.

07:23.880 --> 07:25.030
- All good?
- All good.

07:25.440 --> 07:30.196
Joanie, tell me this isn't
some great, big, fat joke.

07:30.280 --> 07:31.919
It's all real, darling.

07:32.840 --> 07:33.956
Breathe.

07:35.320 --> 07:38.279
- Joe, come on, we're waiting for you.
- Come on.

07:38.880 --> 07:41.236
Let's do this.

07:45.680 --> 07:48.036
Hello, my baby's baby.

07:48.360 --> 07:51.637
- I need a nap.
- Poor Mommy.

07:52.680 --> 07:55.354
Well, lamb.

07:55.440 --> 07:57.636
- There you are.
- Yeah, I'm sorry I'm late.

07:57.760 --> 08:00.434
I was looking for some decent cigars
to give to Dad.

08:01.440 --> 08:03.716
I didn't get him anything.
Was I supposed to?

08:03.800 --> 08:06.679
Darling, no. He's been lavished enough.

08:08.000 --> 08:10.356
- Hey, monkey.
- Hey, sis.

08:11.320 --> 08:12.834
Hello, little man.

08:13.760 --> 08:15.035
David.

08:15.640 --> 08:17.154
I've been wanting to tell you.

08:17.240 --> 08:19.550
Your father showed me your short story.

08:20.600 --> 08:21.600
Yeah?

08:22.240 --> 08:24.835
I think it's beautifully written.

08:26.440 --> 08:28.033
What did he say?

08:28.920 --> 08:31.071
We haven't discussed it yet.

08:32.280 --> 08:34.510
- More like this, please.
- Hi.

08:34.799 --> 08:35.870
That's great.

08:36.159 --> 08:37.594
Looking so good, Joe.

08:37.760 --> 08:38.955
Mr. Castleman.

08:39.960 --> 08:41.360
There, good.

08:41.480 --> 08:43.153
David, you just got here?

08:43.240 --> 08:44.435
- Yeah.
- Thank you so much.

08:44.520 --> 08:46.512
- Thank you.
- Congrats, Pa.

08:47.240 --> 08:48.469
What's this?

08:48.880 --> 08:50.200
They're Maduros.

08:51.280 --> 08:52.839
My God.

08:53.280 --> 08:55.715
- These are spectacular.
- No problem.

08:55.800 --> 08:58.190
What a lovely gift. Thank you, David.

08:59.200 --> 09:00.953
You're still smoking, I see.

09:01.040 --> 09:02.918
- You care?
- Of course I care.

09:03.000 --> 09:04.514
I'd like to see you outlive me.

09:04.600 --> 09:07.035
- So, did you read my piece?
- Yes. We'll talk.

09:07.200 --> 09:08.759
So it is a piece of shit?

09:10.320 --> 09:11.390
Why do you do that?

09:11.480 --> 09:13.016
Because you're clearly
avoiding the subject.

09:13.040 --> 09:16.033
No, I'm clearly distracted
at the moment.

09:16.120 --> 09:17.952
Look, we'll talk
when the time is appropriate.

09:18.600 --> 09:20.478
- Okay?
- Yeah, okay.

09:21.240 --> 09:23.357
Please, go and help your mother.

09:23.440 --> 09:26.319
- No, Joan, let me do this.
- No...

09:26.400 --> 09:28.596
- Please, you enjoy yourself.
- Joanie.

09:34.280 --> 09:36.556
Here, Joanie. Come.

09:37.160 --> 09:38.913
There, some champagne. Where's Susannah?

09:39.000 --> 09:40.116
Right there.

09:40.200 --> 09:41.270
Dad, I'm right here.

09:41.360 --> 09:43.431
Come. Get yourself a glass.

09:43.920 --> 09:45.070
I'm not drinking.

09:45.160 --> 09:48.949
A glass of champagne will not harm
the baby, believe me.

09:49.040 --> 09:51.555
- Quiet, please.
- Okay? Let's do this.

09:51.640 --> 09:52.710
Joe.

09:55.080 --> 10:00.030
To quote from
the <i>Meditations of Quixote,</i>

10:00.640 --> 10:04.031
"I am I, plus my surroundings,

10:04.600 --> 10:07.195
"and if I do not preserve the latter,

10:07.400 --> 10:09.517
"I do not preserve myself."

10:11.680 --> 10:15.276
Today, I'm the happiest of men.

10:15.760 --> 10:19.720
I have my health,
give or take a few bypasses.

10:20.920 --> 10:25.437
I have you, my wonderful friends,
my ever-curious students,

10:25.880 --> 10:30.113
my son, David,
my beautiful daughter, Susannah,

10:30.200 --> 10:32.112
and a future grandchild,

10:32.680 --> 10:38.233
who at this moment is happily floating
in her mother's amniotic fluid.

10:40.560 --> 10:44.156
And finally...

10:47.320 --> 10:52.270
Finally, I have my beautiful wife, Joan,
the love of my life.

10:52.360 --> 10:55.432
Joan, come here. The love of my life.

10:58.520 --> 10:59.795
Without this woman,

11:02.200 --> 11:03.634
I am nothing.

11:05.240 --> 11:08.472
In fact, my greatest achievement is,

11:09.400 --> 11:11.869
well, persuading this woman to marry me.

11:12.160 --> 11:14.880
- Hal, please, get him to wrap it up.
- No.

11:14.960 --> 11:17.475
To Joseph Castleman,

11:17.600 --> 11:21.116
who, in my opinion, is the greatest
living author of the 20th century.

11:21.360 --> 11:22.555
Joe!

11:22.640 --> 11:24.279
- Dad.
- To Joe!

11:24.360 --> 11:26.477
Thank you, everybody.

11:35.440 --> 11:37.875
Would you like another biscuit,
Mr. Castleman?

11:37.960 --> 11:39.280
Sure, yeah.

11:39.680 --> 11:40.750
Where are you from?

11:40.840 --> 11:42.911
- Cambridge.
- Nice.

11:43.000 --> 11:44.480
- Have you been?
- No.

11:45.160 --> 11:47.277
Would you like another biscuit,
Mrs. Castleman?

11:47.440 --> 11:48.760
Thank you, no.

11:51.680 --> 11:54.434
- You want a bite of my cookie?
- No, thank you.

11:59.360 --> 12:02.080
- You want another pillow?
- Got one.

12:05.480 --> 12:07.790
You want to take a look at this?

12:08.320 --> 12:10.789
I really want to do my crossword.

12:11.320 --> 12:13.232
Excuse me, Mr. Castleman.

12:13.320 --> 12:14.536
There's a gentleman in the back

12:14.560 --> 12:16.376
that says he knows you
and would like to say hello.

12:16.400 --> 12:17.436
Nathaniel Bone?

12:17.520 --> 12:19.512
- Tell him...
- Sorry to interrupt.

12:20.120 --> 12:21.395
Thank you.

12:21.480 --> 12:23.915
I just wanted to say congratulations.

12:25.040 --> 12:26.360
- Hello, Nathaniel.
- Hey.

12:26.440 --> 12:29.280
I take it you're not flying to Stockholm
purely for the pickled herring.

12:29.560 --> 12:32.075
No. I wouldn't miss your award
for anything.

12:32.160 --> 12:34.117
It's truly
an astounding achievement, Joe.

12:34.200 --> 12:35.793
It's not about the prize, Nathaniel.

12:35.880 --> 12:38.475
It's about getting up the gumption
to write the next book.

12:38.720 --> 12:41.474
Absolutely. Well, that is
why you are who you are.

12:41.760 --> 12:44.036
May I also say congratulations
to you as well, Joan.

12:44.120 --> 12:46.120
I don't think people give
the spouse enough credit.

12:46.360 --> 12:50.832
I give my wife credit.
I give her plenty of credit.

12:51.200 --> 12:54.113
That's not what I meant.
I meant the rest of the world.

12:54.200 --> 12:56.157
The critics, the readers
and most of all...

12:56.240 --> 12:58.040
Nathaniel, I know I'm supposed
to be impressed

12:58.120 --> 13:00.680
that somehow you've wheedled
your way onto this flight,

13:00.800 --> 13:01.836
but I'm telling you,

13:01.920 --> 13:05.231
I am not giving you permission
to write my biography.

13:05.320 --> 13:07.096
- Now, would you please leave us alone?
- Absolutely.

13:07.120 --> 13:08.576
- You've made that abundantly clear.
- Fine.

13:08.600 --> 13:09.670
- Good.
- I'm so sorry.

13:09.760 --> 13:10.856
- I just wanted to say congratulations.
- Okay.

13:10.880 --> 13:12.997
Thank you for coming by
and saying hello, Nathaniel.

13:13.080 --> 13:15.037
I mean it, sincerely. Thank you.

13:16.080 --> 13:18.470
Hey, David, how's the writing going?

13:18.600 --> 13:21.877
- Move on, Nathaniel.
- Go back to sleep. Apologies.

13:22.920 --> 13:25.196
- What a schmuck.
- You were rude.

13:26.280 --> 13:29.000
You gotta be rude, otherwise the guy
won't give up. Jesus Christ.

13:29.120 --> 13:31.635
You don't want to make an enemy
of somebody like that.

13:31.720 --> 13:33.456
I mean, there's nothing more dangerous
than a writer

13:33.480 --> 13:34.914
whose feelings have been hurt.

13:35.440 --> 13:38.877
Fuck him if he can't take
a perfectly-justified rejection.

13:38.960 --> 13:41.919
- I was just making an observation.
- Yeah, well, fine, good.

13:42.800 --> 13:45.554
Don't forget to stretch your legs
like Dr. Krentz says.

13:45.640 --> 13:46.756
Yeah.

13:54.680 --> 13:57.240
<i>Mr. Castleman, welcome to Stockholm.</i>

13:57.760 --> 13:59.399
<i>We are so delighted to have you here.</i>

13:59.480 --> 14:01.233
Thank you so much.

14:01.880 --> 14:04.031
Please. A moment.

14:07.200 --> 14:08.475
All right, darling.

14:09.000 --> 14:11.310
- Please, follow me.
- Of course.

14:11.600 --> 14:13.193
Well, that was

14:13.280 --> 14:14.856
- quite a journey getting here.
- Excuse me, Mr Castleman.

14:14.880 --> 14:16.872
- It was. Was it...
- Thank you.

14:17.000 --> 14:18.120
- Just one more.
- Thank you.

14:18.440 --> 14:21.433
Mrs. Castleman, I wanna apologize
for intruding earlier.

14:21.520 --> 14:23.477
I certainly didn't wanna be a pest.

14:23.560 --> 14:26.792
Well, I apologize
for my husband's rudeness.

14:27.160 --> 14:31.279
No need. I know he's swamped
by glad-handers all the time.

14:32.480 --> 14:34.915
Shall we pretend
I said something amusing,

14:35.000 --> 14:37.640
so it'll look like
you're enjoying yourself as well?

14:38.200 --> 14:41.796
No, thank you. I'm very comfortable
standing here in my own thoughts.

14:42.040 --> 14:44.475
Joanie, please.

14:44.960 --> 14:46.360
- My wife.
- Yes.

14:48.040 --> 14:50.316
Mrs. Castleman. Hello.
I'm Arvid Engdahl.

14:50.400 --> 14:52.153
I am the one who called you
about the prize,

14:52.240 --> 14:54.675
waking you up at such an ungodly hour.

14:54.760 --> 14:58.640
Not ungodly at all.
It added 10 years to my husband's life.

15:04.080 --> 15:07.471
This is the wife of Joe Castleman.

15:08.480 --> 15:11.757
Mr. Castleman, may I introduce you
to Walter Bark,

15:11.840 --> 15:14.116
who will be accompanying you
on your engagements.

15:14.920 --> 15:16.832
Mr. Castleman, it's an honor.

15:16.920 --> 15:19.151
We'll be providing you
with anything you need.

15:19.240 --> 15:22.438
Thank you. I can assure you
I'm very low-maintenance.

15:22.880 --> 15:24.280
Only when he's asleep.

15:26.000 --> 15:29.232
This is Mrs. LindelÃ¶f,
who looks after our laureate wives.

15:29.480 --> 15:31.676
- Hello.
- Mrs. Castleman.

15:31.760 --> 15:33.956
They'll be keeping your husband
very busy,

15:34.040 --> 15:37.590
so I can arrange for shopping
and beauty treatments.

15:37.680 --> 15:39.797
Thank you. We'll see, but...

15:40.440 --> 15:44.514
Mr. Castleman,
may I introduce to you Linnea Engwall

15:44.600 --> 15:46.398
who will be your personal photographer.

15:46.480 --> 15:49.279
- From your publishing house.
- It's an honor, Mr. Castleman.

15:49.360 --> 15:50.919
I'm very much admiring of your work.

15:51.000 --> 15:52.753
Thank you. You're very kind.

15:53.480 --> 15:55.915
And I will be trailing you
with my camera,

15:56.000 --> 15:58.834
but, of course,
you just pretend I'm not there, okay?

16:00.400 --> 16:02.312
This is Mrs. Castleman.

16:03.800 --> 16:04.880
- Nice to meet you.
- David.

16:04.920 --> 16:08.311
I'd like you to meet my son, David.

16:08.400 --> 16:11.552
Hello, David.
We are so very glad you could come.

16:11.840 --> 16:15.311
We are always pleased to have
the children of our laureates.

16:15.400 --> 16:19.394
In fact, we see you
as just as engaging as your father.

16:20.360 --> 16:22.829
All right. Okay.

16:23.360 --> 16:25.955
I can assure you,
my son is very engaging

16:26.280 --> 16:28.476
when he's not in the throes of jet lag.

16:30.000 --> 16:32.959
Well, shall we take you
to your room, then?

16:33.160 --> 16:35.629
Yes, thank you. That would be very nice.

16:35.720 --> 16:37.439
- Lead on.
- Thank you.

16:50.240 --> 16:53.312
This will be from my lawyer.

16:53.640 --> 16:55.757
- Do you have my reading glasses?
- Yeah.

16:55.880 --> 16:59.078
Yeah, he always sends
the same cheap shit.

17:00.160 --> 17:01.310
Here you are.

17:03.000 --> 17:05.276
Yeah, that's him. What a cheapskate.

17:05.359 --> 17:06.953
David, do you want this for your room?

17:07.319 --> 17:08.356
No, Pop.

17:10.560 --> 17:11.675
Chocolates.

17:13.880 --> 17:14.996
That's delicious.

17:15.079 --> 17:16.150
David?

17:16.359 --> 17:17.476
No.

17:22.839 --> 17:25.513
"Enjoy, enjoy. From Sylvia Fry."

17:25.800 --> 17:27.280
Who the hell is Sylvia Fry?

17:29.120 --> 17:30.520
One of your characters.

17:31.680 --> 17:32.875
Jesus, Dad.

17:32.960 --> 17:35.270
Don't be hard on him, David. He's tired.

17:35.360 --> 17:37.477
My memory's a little shot at, okay?

17:37.600 --> 17:39.159
It'll happen to you.

17:39.280 --> 17:40.999
Sooner, perhaps, with your smoking.

17:41.200 --> 17:42.554
Sure, Pop.

17:45.080 --> 17:47.515
Don't eat all of those.
You'll get heartburn.

17:48.520 --> 17:50.239
Have you seen this library, Joan?

17:50.400 --> 17:51.834
They've got all the books.

17:54.920 --> 17:56.036
What's it...

17:59.080 --> 18:02.960
They've even got a copy of <i>The Walnut</i>
in fucking Arabic.

18:03.440 --> 18:07.070
- Did you know about this edition?
- Yeah. It bought our Sub-Zero.

18:07.160 --> 18:09.152
Careful with that. Would you be careful?

18:10.320 --> 18:12.710
What... Oh, my... What are you doing?

18:13.880 --> 18:16.096
- What is the matter with you?
- I'm gonna go and find my room.

18:16.120 --> 18:17.839
All right, darling. Get some rest.

18:18.480 --> 18:20.631
- Here, take some fruit with you.
- Yeah.

18:22.240 --> 18:23.674
He's in a mood.

18:23.880 --> 18:26.031
Well, let's hope he gets laid
while he's here.

18:26.200 --> 18:28.317
Joe, don't be so crude.

18:28.400 --> 18:29.470
What?

18:32.880 --> 18:34.872
Joanie, is there something bugging you?

18:35.520 --> 18:36.749
No.

18:37.600 --> 18:39.671
I wasn't attracted to that woman,
you know.

18:39.840 --> 18:41.638
I really could care less.

18:42.280 --> 18:44.920
Here, brush your teeth.
Your breath is bad.

18:45.640 --> 18:46.676
Really?

18:48.360 --> 18:50.317
God. You think they noticed?

18:50.520 --> 18:53.080
No, they were too busy being awed.

18:53.800 --> 18:54.916
God.

18:55.720 --> 18:57.996
All this attention's giving me agita.

19:01.160 --> 19:04.597
I don't know. Do you...
Could you just listen to my heart?

19:06.320 --> 19:08.357
- Is it skipping a beat?
- No, it's not.

19:11.360 --> 19:14.273
- God, I'm too old for this.
- We both are, darling.

19:25.960 --> 19:28.600
So what do we do now? We going out?

19:28.680 --> 19:31.559
No. We're gonna get some sleep.

19:34.560 --> 19:36.313
- Joanie.
- What?

19:36.400 --> 19:37.959
Can we try to enjoy this?

20:05.680 --> 20:06.716
<i>Hello, Miss Archer.</i>

20:06.960 --> 20:08.440
Please, come in.

20:19.840 --> 20:21.160
Your story.

20:22.160 --> 20:24.595
I've read it twice,
and frankly, both times...

20:26.680 --> 20:28.399
I found it to be quite good.

20:28.720 --> 20:30.439
Thank you, Professor.

20:32.120 --> 20:35.238
Know that you still have
a long way to go with this piece.

20:35.320 --> 20:37.915
Of course.
I'm more than willing to make fixes.

20:38.080 --> 20:39.878
I'm not asking you to fix anything.

20:40.080 --> 20:41.480
I'm asking you to go deeper.

20:41.920 --> 20:44.230
You write with a lot of intelligence,

20:46.440 --> 20:47.440
but you're detached.

20:47.520 --> 20:51.719
The characters are supposed to be
detached, especially the mother.

20:51.800 --> 20:54.918
But she wasn't always that way, was she?

20:55.480 --> 20:58.075
She was somebody's child once,
somebody's lover.

20:58.560 --> 21:02.873
And she has cravings,
fears, secret desires.

21:03.640 --> 21:05.120
I'm sure she even passes gas.

21:05.240 --> 21:08.119
Yes, she does,
but she blames it on their new maid.

21:09.520 --> 21:11.193
That's very good.

21:11.720 --> 21:13.757
I see I'm going to have
to watch out for you.

21:16.440 --> 21:19.717
I can be quite a handful, Professor.

21:28.720 --> 21:32.873
Don't ever try to put it on.

21:35.680 --> 21:37.797
You're charming enough
just the way you are.

21:47.720 --> 21:49.473
I wanted to ask you something.

21:50.600 --> 21:55.550
I was wondering whether by any chance
you would be free on Saturday night.

21:59.160 --> 22:00.753
Yeah, I am.

22:08.320 --> 22:10.391
Would you be interested in babysitting?

22:11.120 --> 22:14.511
My wife and I, we haven't gotten out
since Fanny was born.

22:16.320 --> 22:18.516
Sure. I love babies.

22:24.280 --> 22:25.280
<i>The true writer,</i>

22:25.680 --> 22:27.672
he does not write to get published.

22:29.400 --> 22:32.916
He writes because he has
something urgent and personal

22:33.000 --> 22:34.514
that he needs to say.

22:38.560 --> 22:41.792
A writer must write, as he must breathe,

22:42.120 --> 22:43.713
and he keeps on doing it,

22:44.400 --> 22:47.359
despite the loneliness,
despite the poverty,

22:47.640 --> 22:49.597
despite the piles of rejection letters,

22:49.760 --> 22:51.797
despite the parent or the wife
who call out,

22:51.880 --> 22:54.031
"You fool.
Why don't you get a real job?"

22:56.200 --> 22:59.113
A writer writes because if he does not,

22:59.840 --> 23:02.480
his soul will starve.

23:06.040 --> 23:09.033
"His soul swooned slowly

23:09.640 --> 23:13.998
"as he heard the snow falling faintly
through the universe

23:14.720 --> 23:20.000
"and faintly falling,
like the descent of their last end,

23:20.160 --> 23:23.392
"upon all the living and the dead."

23:27.200 --> 23:29.510
James Joyce. No more needs to be said.

23:29.760 --> 23:31.592
- I asked you to heat her bottle.
- I did.

23:31.720 --> 23:33.996
- It's ice-cold.
- I did it when you told me to do it.

23:35.160 --> 23:37.356
I'm warning you, it's chaos in here.
Come in.

23:37.520 --> 23:40.274
- Is that the girl?
- Yes. Her name is Joan.

23:40.880 --> 23:43.156
Hello. The baby's up here.

23:44.480 --> 23:46.711
Carol, could you get my tie
for me, please?

23:46.800 --> 23:48.757
- It's on the bed.
- Yeah, I know that.

23:48.880 --> 23:50.109
Could you get it for me?

23:52.040 --> 23:53.269
Joan, go on up.

24:03.480 --> 24:06.279
This is my life, God help me.

24:51.400 --> 24:53.710
It's okay.

24:54.440 --> 24:56.113
It's all right.

24:59.240 --> 25:01.516
I'm falling in love with your daddy.

26:08.440 --> 26:11.990
- Oh, my God.
- Good morning, Mr. Castleman.

26:12.080 --> 26:13.080
That's...

26:13.200 --> 26:17.831
This is Santa Lucia, who has come
to show her respect for a great writer.

26:17.920 --> 26:19.559
Sorry, Santa Lucia?

26:19.680 --> 26:22.718
Yes, I believe I informed you
about this yesterday.

26:22.800 --> 26:25.395
Well, you probably did. I don't...

26:25.520 --> 26:27.352
That looks wonderful. Thank you.

26:27.680 --> 26:28.909
Excuse me.

26:29.560 --> 26:31.560
- Where are you going, honey?
- I gotta freshen up.

26:33.120 --> 26:36.909
I'm so sorry if this was
any kind of inconvenience.

26:37.560 --> 26:41.315
I have to say I'm rather grateful.
I was in the middle of a nightmare.

26:41.520 --> 26:45.309
I was back in Brooklyn
living with my mother.

26:51.440 --> 26:56.799
And she says, "Joe,
I have some terrible news."

26:57.040 --> 26:59.839
And before she can get it out,
my tiny Russian grandmother,

26:59.920 --> 27:02.230
who's built like a footstool,
screams at her.

27:02.360 --> 27:07.037
"Not before dinner.
You'll ruin his appetite."

27:12.320 --> 27:14.073
"You'll ruin his appetite."

27:14.520 --> 27:18.070
Excuse me, I hate to interrupt
this wonderful exchange,

27:18.160 --> 27:20.675
but I'd like to introduce the Castlemans

27:20.760 --> 27:23.195
to another one of our laureate families.

27:23.280 --> 27:26.273
Okay, good.
I'll see you later, gentlemen.

27:26.360 --> 27:28.158
James Finch is getting our prize
in physics.

27:28.280 --> 27:30.078
He's a brilliant man and nice as can be.

27:30.160 --> 27:31.310
Good.

27:31.640 --> 27:36.396
James Finch, may I introduce you
to the novelist Joseph Castleman?

27:36.480 --> 27:38.392
- A pleasure to meet you, Joseph.
- And you.

27:38.480 --> 27:40.915
I wish I could say
that I'd read all your books.

27:41.080 --> 27:44.994
Well, I wish I could say
that I understood all your formulas.

27:45.720 --> 27:47.996
I've read your books and, I promise you,

27:48.080 --> 27:50.640
they're a far better read
than James' scribblings.

27:50.720 --> 27:53.235
My wife, Constance,
is a scientist as well.

27:53.320 --> 27:55.880
As you can see,
she's quite critical of my work.

27:56.680 --> 27:59.434
Well, my wife doesn't write, thank God,

27:59.520 --> 28:02.115
otherwise I'd suffer
permanent writer's block.

28:03.000 --> 28:05.037
Hello. I'm Joan.

28:05.680 --> 28:06.716
Hello.

28:07.000 --> 28:08.639
Joan is the love of my life.

28:09.680 --> 28:12.195
Let me introduce my children.
This is Ellen.

28:12.280 --> 28:14.920
I'm counting on her
to find the cure to Alzheimer's

28:15.000 --> 28:16.514
just in time for my own dementia.

28:17.400 --> 28:20.199
My son, David, is a writer.

28:20.800 --> 28:22.553
He's developing quite a voice.

28:22.640 --> 28:26.759
Well, Sam is working
in conductive polymers.

28:27.360 --> 28:29.955
Peter is interested in prime factors.

28:30.200 --> 28:32.510
And Chester, well,

28:32.840 --> 28:35.275
he's trying to disprove
the string theory.

28:35.480 --> 28:38.393
It's a bit out of his league,
but we indulge him.

28:38.480 --> 28:40.915
I'm so sorry, Mr. Castleman.
I have to steal you away.

28:41.000 --> 28:43.117
We have to go to your lecture.
Follow me, please.

28:43.240 --> 28:44.515
Thank you.

28:48.360 --> 28:49.794
Well, I'll...

28:50.480 --> 28:51.800
Good to meet you, James.

28:51.880 --> 28:54.016
- Wonderful to meet you, Joseph.
- Yes, and you, of course.

28:54.040 --> 28:55.838
- A pleasure, Jean.
- Joan.

28:56.240 --> 28:58.152
- My apologies.
- No matter.

28:58.240 --> 28:59.799
So the main problem that we're having

28:59.880 --> 29:03.271
with the hydrothermal liquefaction
is the high mineral content of the...

29:08.600 --> 29:09.920
- Hi.
- Hi.

29:10.400 --> 29:12.995
- How are you?
- I'm fine.

29:13.600 --> 29:16.479
- And you?
- No, I'm very good.

29:16.800 --> 29:18.598
- Can I take a picture?
- Of course.

29:23.880 --> 29:25.030
Catch you later.

29:37.800 --> 29:39.837
And, David, will you do me a favor?

29:39.920 --> 29:43.436
Next time I introduce you,
try a little eye contact.

29:43.520 --> 29:44.556
Sure.

29:45.040 --> 29:48.750
And next time, don't refer to me
as your son, the half-baked writer.

29:48.840 --> 29:51.639
- What are you talking about?
- "He's developing his voice"?

29:52.160 --> 29:53.719
What is that supposed to mean?

29:54.480 --> 29:56.836
It's a fact.
You are developing your voice.

29:57.560 --> 30:01.315
And it takes a little time,
just as it took me time to develop mine.

30:01.400 --> 30:03.835
No, it didn't. You had a hit novel
right out of the gate.

30:04.520 --> 30:06.193
I grew up hard, my friend.

30:06.400 --> 30:08.400
You live a little,
let's see what you come up with.

30:08.920 --> 30:10.976
- You're not smoking in here.
- I can open the window.

30:11.000 --> 30:13.196
Forget it.
It's zero fucking degrees out there.

30:13.280 --> 30:14.560
You shouldn't be smoking anyway.

30:14.600 --> 30:17.040
Yeah? And you shouldn't be
stuffing your face with animal fat.

30:17.080 --> 30:18.336
What the fuck is the matter with you?

30:18.360 --> 30:20.556
Stop it now. Stop it, both of you.

30:22.400 --> 30:25.199
Are you pissed because
we haven't discussed your story?

30:25.280 --> 30:26.509
Is that what's bugging you?

30:26.600 --> 30:28.536
I don't need to discuss something
that you have been avoiding

30:28.560 --> 30:30.358
like some steaming pile of shit

30:30.440 --> 30:32.477
that I deposited on the desk.

30:32.600 --> 30:34.751
I have read your story, okay?

30:35.200 --> 30:38.511
And my opinion is it's a solid start.

30:38.920 --> 30:40.536
But that's not
what you wanna hear, is it?

30:40.560 --> 30:43.200
No, you wanna hear
it's a breathtaking work of genius.

30:43.320 --> 30:45.960
That's not what I wanna hear.
Jesus fucking Christ, Dad.

30:46.040 --> 30:47.554
- Stop it.
- Don't...

30:47.640 --> 30:49.199
- Stop it.
- Such a prick.

30:50.680 --> 30:55.391
David, would you like to spend
the rest of the day on your own?

30:55.520 --> 30:57.159
He's going to miss my lecture.

30:57.960 --> 31:00.270
- David, would you like that?
- Yeah, I would.

31:03.840 --> 31:05.400
What are you going to do with yourself?

31:05.800 --> 31:08.520
It's Stockholm.
It's a major European city.

31:08.600 --> 31:09.670
Yeah.

31:11.040 --> 31:13.600
Shall I let you off here? On the street?

31:13.920 --> 31:15.240
Would that do you?

31:15.320 --> 31:18.040
Gustav, would you pull over, please?

31:18.200 --> 31:19.200
<i>Okay, sir.</i>

31:19.280 --> 31:20.873
I'm gonna give you some money.

31:21.440 --> 31:23.352
- Do you know the way back to the hotel?
- Yeah.

31:24.360 --> 31:26.158
You check in with us
when you get back, okay?

31:26.280 --> 31:28.351
Yeah, sure. Thanks, Mom.

31:32.160 --> 31:33.276
Jesus.

31:36.360 --> 31:38.716
- It's not easy being your son, Joe.
- Come on.

31:39.120 --> 31:40.952
It's not easy being anyone's son.

31:41.040 --> 31:42.838
You could act a little prouder of him.

31:43.120 --> 31:44.918
Or he could work a little harder.

31:45.400 --> 31:48.313
We wouldn't be doing the kid
any favor telling him he's brilliant.

31:48.400 --> 31:51.950
- I think he has talent.
- Yeah, well, you should tell him.

31:52.080 --> 31:54.231
It doesn't mean anything coming from me.

31:54.400 --> 31:56.153
He has to hear it from you.

31:57.400 --> 31:59.790
He shouldn't need my approval to write.

32:00.680 --> 32:02.831
Everyone needs approval, Joe.

32:04.960 --> 32:05.960
Yeah.

32:08.120 --> 32:09.998
These shoes are killing me.

32:10.920 --> 32:12.115
Here, come here.

32:12.240 --> 32:14.357
Come here. Give me.

32:21.120 --> 32:23.680
Joe, please don't thank me
in your speech.

32:23.760 --> 32:24.876
What?

32:26.200 --> 32:29.557
I don't want to be thought of
as the long-suffering wife.

32:31.160 --> 32:34.551
- You understand that, don't you?
- No. I have to thank you.

32:34.960 --> 32:36.872
Everyone thanks their wife.

32:37.040 --> 32:39.919
If I don't, I'll come off
like some narcissistic bastard.

32:40.000 --> 32:42.196
- Well, you are.
- Oh, God.

32:42.480 --> 32:43.800
No, it'll be quick, Joanie.

32:44.080 --> 32:46.231
You know, one sentence.
It'll be painless.

32:46.560 --> 32:48.916
- Come on.
- No.

32:56.080 --> 32:57.230
You okay?

33:04.400 --> 33:06.232
Do what you need to do.

33:07.520 --> 33:08.556
The Faculty Wife.

33:12.040 --> 33:18.480
You've shed quite an interesting light
on Mrs. Castleman.

33:19.440 --> 33:23.036
No, it's not about your wife at all.
It's just a character study.

33:29.800 --> 33:33.953
Miss Archer, I've already told you
that your work is good.

33:34.920 --> 33:36.639
But I'm not sure
I got it through to you.

33:46.520 --> 33:49.592
This is from my novel, <i>Sleeping Dogs.</i>

33:54.280 --> 33:55.953
I know most of you haven't read it

33:56.040 --> 33:58.509
because it's only sold
1,000 copies.

33:59.560 --> 34:01.358
Most of which were bought
by my relatives,

34:01.440 --> 34:04.160
who were paid handsomely by me.

34:06.800 --> 34:09.793
So, here we go. Chapter one...

34:10.840 --> 34:13.400
- No, thank you.
- Could I introduce you to...

34:14.679 --> 34:16.840
- They're so green.
- We've been through this before...

34:16.960 --> 34:19.839
Elaine, let me introduce you
to Miss Archer,

34:19.920 --> 34:22.879
the promising young writer
I told you about. One second.

34:22.960 --> 34:25.839
Excuse me. Joan, please. Excuse us.

34:28.159 --> 34:29.799
Joan, this is Elaine Mozell.

34:29.920 --> 34:31.274
Hello. Hi.

34:31.360 --> 34:35.070
Your prose is brilliant.
It's clean and vivid and bold.

34:35.159 --> 34:36.958
Thank you, but you know what?

34:37.040 --> 34:40.795
The public can't stomach
bold prose from a woman.

34:41.040 --> 34:42.599
You're talented, I hear.

34:44.239 --> 34:48.074
Thank you.
Yeah, I love to write. It's my life.

34:49.800 --> 34:51.393
Don't do it.

34:52.159 --> 34:53.310
Excuse me?

34:54.040 --> 34:56.679
You wanna know
where your books will end up?

34:58.120 --> 35:01.670
Right there. On the alumni shelf.

35:05.760 --> 35:06.760
Go ahead, open it up.

35:10.280 --> 35:13.751
You hear that? That's the sound
of a book that's never been opened.

35:17.360 --> 35:21.798
Don't ever think
that you can get their attention.

35:22.880 --> 35:24.280
- Whose?
- The men.

35:25.200 --> 35:28.796
Who write the reviews.
Who run the publishing houses.

35:28.880 --> 35:30.792
Who edit the magazines.

35:31.000 --> 35:34.198
The ones who decide
who gets to be taken seriously,

35:34.280 --> 35:36.875
who gets to be put up on a pedestal
for the rest of their lives.

35:36.960 --> 35:38.519
A writer has to write.

35:39.600 --> 35:41.717
A writer has to be read, honey.

35:44.040 --> 35:45.156
Has anyone got a light?

35:54.760 --> 35:55.830
Joe?

35:58.080 --> 35:59.196
Joe?

36:07.400 --> 36:08.400
Joe?

36:12.080 --> 36:13.080
Joe?

36:23.880 --> 36:25.519
You wanna join me?

36:29.160 --> 36:31.391
No. I should go home.

36:31.480 --> 36:32.755
Okay.

36:32.840 --> 36:34.274
Go to bed.

36:35.680 --> 36:38.479
Is it still snowing out there?

36:41.240 --> 36:44.517
Then let me send you out with this.

36:47.320 --> 36:50.199
"His soul swooned slowly

36:50.280 --> 36:54.194
"as he heard the snow falling faintly
through the universe

36:55.120 --> 36:56.600
"and faintly falling,

36:57.840 --> 37:00.196
"like the descent of their last end,

37:01.040 --> 37:03.430
"upon all the living and the dead."

37:06.240 --> 37:07.469
That's beautiful.

37:08.360 --> 37:09.953
Did you write it?

37:12.520 --> 37:13.636
No.

37:17.960 --> 37:20.634
Well, time to go.

37:22.960 --> 37:24.280
It's late.

37:25.560 --> 37:27.916
- Good night.
- Good night.

37:31.040 --> 37:33.600
I know. I know what you're gonna say.

37:34.120 --> 37:37.033
I'm killing myself eating all this fat.

37:38.600 --> 37:39.750
You will.

37:58.120 --> 37:59.600
What are we doing?

38:03.920 --> 38:07.596
Listen, why don't we
knock this whole thing on the head?

38:08.880 --> 38:11.918
Go and hole up in a cabin in a fjord.
Drink ourselves silly.

38:13.120 --> 38:14.952
Howl at the northern lights.

38:18.680 --> 38:21.275
If only.

38:48.680 --> 38:49.750
Come in.

38:50.640 --> 38:53.200
Mr. Castleman will have his lunch
in here.

38:59.880 --> 39:02.076
- Joe, you've gotta get up.
- Yeah.

39:02.160 --> 39:03.913
They're picking you up in 40 minutes.

39:04.000 --> 39:06.071
Oh, Jesus. Okay, I'm coming.

39:06.160 --> 39:07.674
Your lunch is here.

39:12.640 --> 39:14.836
Here are your spare glasses.

39:18.160 --> 39:20.152
And here are your pills.

39:20.240 --> 39:21.720
You're not coming with me?

39:21.800 --> 39:24.269
No, I'd like to spend some time
by myself.

39:25.240 --> 39:26.469
What are you gonna do?

39:27.480 --> 39:30.712
I don't know.
Maybe go on a tour of the city.

39:31.520 --> 39:33.910
What, some lousy tour bus?

39:34.360 --> 39:37.956
Joe, I'll be in a much better mood
if you let me go.

39:38.480 --> 39:41.314
I thought this was something
we should be doing together.

39:41.440 --> 39:42.715
Take one of these at 3:00.

39:43.760 --> 39:45.592
And I've set your watch.

40:00.400 --> 40:02.915
- Mrs. Castleman.
- Nathaniel.

40:03.680 --> 40:05.080
I'm not stalking you, I promise.

40:05.760 --> 40:08.878
But I do have something for you.
I was gonna leave it at the desk.

40:09.160 --> 40:12.073
Just a little something
I picked up at a bookstore at Smith

40:12.160 --> 40:14.231
when I was doing some research on Joe.

40:15.760 --> 40:17.194
Northrop House.

40:17.840 --> 40:19.194
That was my dorm.

40:19.880 --> 40:20.880
I know.

40:20.960 --> 40:22.360
It's quite a bit before your time,

40:22.480 --> 40:24.472
but I thought
you'd get a kick out of it.

40:25.480 --> 40:28.359
Thank you, Nathaniel.
This is very thoughtful of you.

40:28.440 --> 40:32.559
You've always been so kind to me
in my aborted attempts at wooing Joe.

40:32.640 --> 40:34.791
I'd love to buy you a drink, if I may.

40:34.880 --> 40:37.315
There's a lovely bar close by,
very 19th century.

40:37.400 --> 40:39.710
You can imagine Strindberg
getting hammered in there.

40:40.160 --> 40:42.231
I don't know
how appropriate that would be.

40:42.840 --> 40:44.559
Well, it's completely inappropriate.

40:45.160 --> 40:48.119
But here we are in Sweden,
it's the dead of winter.

40:48.720 --> 40:51.030
I don't think either one of us
wanna be completely alone

40:51.120 --> 40:54.033
in our own brooding thoughts
right now, do we?

40:57.160 --> 40:58.160
Nice.

40:58.800 --> 41:02.589
I do actually have a confession.

41:03.880 --> 41:06.873
I have gotten an offer
to write a book about Joe.

41:09.560 --> 41:14.760
I wanted to tell you so you don't think
I'm doing anything behind his back.

41:16.320 --> 41:19.154
And is this going to be
a scholarly work?

41:23.720 --> 41:25.154
Yes and no.

41:26.400 --> 41:27.720
Meaning what?

41:29.000 --> 41:32.960
You may as well know
that I am aware of Joe's various...

41:34.560 --> 41:36.040
Indiscretions.

41:38.920 --> 41:40.752
Well, I'm sure you are.

41:42.000 --> 41:46.074
I can imagine it's veryjuicy material
for a biographer.

41:47.960 --> 41:52.432
You would think so, but,
to be honest, it's a tad predictable.

41:52.640 --> 41:56.793
Most of your men of genius
tend to have overactive libidos,

41:57.080 --> 41:59.993
and thanks to worshipful tomes
put out by us biographers,

42:00.120 --> 42:04.080
we're all supposed to find it
charming and forgivable.

42:06.280 --> 42:10.274
I don't, actually.
I find that behavior rather appalling.

42:11.160 --> 42:14.073
Well, please don't paint me as a victim.

42:15.280 --> 42:17.795
I am much more interesting than that.

42:24.720 --> 42:25.790
I know you are.

42:29.320 --> 42:33.553
Look, I don't wanna make the wrong
assumptions about your relationship.

42:34.160 --> 42:38.074
Now we have an opportunity
to set the record straight.

42:42.520 --> 42:44.477
You are so transparent, Nathaniel.

42:44.560 --> 42:48.520
I can't believe I let you lure me here.

42:49.520 --> 42:52.831
Of course, you have
the opportunity to leave,

42:52.920 --> 42:57.631
spend the rest of the day in some
draughty museum of obscure Nordic art.

42:58.800 --> 43:01.793
Or we can enjoy these excellent drinks.

43:02.080 --> 43:03.080
Morning, Joseph.

43:03.160 --> 43:04.958
Professor Chen Ling, chemistry.

43:05.040 --> 43:06.040
Hello.

43:06.120 --> 43:08.794
- Dr. Karl Seigler, medicine.
- How do you do?

43:08.880 --> 43:11.839
- And Sir Randall Meade, economics.
- Pleasure.

43:11.920 --> 43:13.593
For me, too.

43:13.680 --> 43:16.036
I'll turn you over now briefly
to Mr. Lagerfelt,

43:16.120 --> 43:18.840
who will just run you through
the protocol for tomorrow.

43:18.920 --> 43:22.311
Gentlemen, you will take your seats

43:22.400 --> 43:26.235
indicated for now
by these signs with your names.

43:29.480 --> 43:32.075
When it is time
for you to receive your medal,

43:32.160 --> 43:34.914
you will walk from your seat to here.

43:37.360 --> 43:41.673
And you will receive your medal
from the king.

43:42.120 --> 43:46.797
And then you shall bow,
making the three reverences.

43:56.680 --> 43:57.750
Like so.

43:59.720 --> 44:01.473
We will start with you, Mr. Castleman.

44:03.920 --> 44:04.920
Okay.

44:08.240 --> 44:10.152
Sorry. I bow first?

44:11.040 --> 44:13.509
You approach the king and then you bow.

44:15.120 --> 44:17.316
- I'm sorry.
- No need to apologize.

44:17.400 --> 44:19.039
That is why we are practicing.

44:19.120 --> 44:21.919
It's not rocket science, Castleman.

44:23.480 --> 44:25.233
No, of course.

44:31.960 --> 44:34.077
And now the three reverences.

44:48.400 --> 44:49.959
Walter, could I have a moment?

44:50.080 --> 44:51.376
Are you all right, Mr. Castleman?

44:51.400 --> 44:53.278
I'm fine.
I just need to take a little break.

44:53.360 --> 44:55.875
- Do you need anything? Water or...
- No.

44:55.960 --> 44:58.236
- Just tell us.
- No, please, I'm fine.

44:58.320 --> 45:00.277
- Just for a moment.
- Okay.

45:00.360 --> 45:01.760
We'll walk you out.

45:08.320 --> 45:09.800
I come to you unarmed.

45:14.360 --> 45:16.511
I could tell
that all that clicking in your face

45:16.600 --> 45:17.795
was getting on your nerves.

45:18.120 --> 45:19.440
You're doing your job.

45:19.520 --> 45:21.512
Well, the good news is they told me,

45:21.600 --> 45:23.956
if you wish,
they will release you for the day.

45:24.560 --> 45:26.517
I wish that.

45:28.320 --> 45:32.997
Which of these doors do you think
offers the quickest escape?

45:34.400 --> 45:36.232
Shall we try them and see?

45:38.640 --> 45:40.359
So, I would guess
Joe made you give it up.

45:40.440 --> 45:42.432
Yes, he wants to keep me healthy.

45:54.240 --> 45:57.074
All right,
here's my next fascinating query.

45:59.000 --> 46:02.198
What does the Nobel Prize mean
to Joseph Castleman?

46:02.320 --> 46:03.640
- Oh, God.
- Yeah.

46:04.640 --> 46:07.439
That's not mine. It's not mine.
It's from the publisher.

46:08.480 --> 46:10.597
Why don't I just use
what he said to me on the plane?

46:11.120 --> 46:12.918
"It's not about the prize.

46:13.040 --> 46:16.875
"It's about getting up the gumption
to write the next book."

46:18.000 --> 46:19.753
Perfect. Thank you.

46:20.680 --> 46:22.911
And what about you?
How do you get up the gumption?

46:23.000 --> 46:24.229
To get up in the morning?

46:25.080 --> 46:26.080
To write.

46:26.160 --> 46:28.197
- I'm not a writer.
- I beg to differ.

46:28.720 --> 46:30.376
When I was going through
the Smith archives,

46:30.400 --> 46:31.914
I came across some of your stories

46:32.000 --> 46:33.719
that were published
in the college journal.

46:33.800 --> 46:35.473
I read <i>The Faculty Wife.</i>

46:36.240 --> 46:38.038
Beautifully written piece.

46:38.360 --> 46:39.589
Thank you.

46:40.560 --> 46:42.392
I had some potential.

46:45.200 --> 46:47.112
Ever regret giving it up?

46:47.240 --> 46:48.276
No.

46:49.000 --> 46:51.037
I had very low expectations

46:51.160 --> 46:54.039
about what I could achieve
as a female writer.

46:54.120 --> 46:57.192
There were plenty of successful
female writers back then.

46:58.000 --> 47:01.630
Yes, but I didn't have
the personality for it.

47:03.400 --> 47:04.470
Really?

47:05.320 --> 47:09.030
I'm quite shy.
I don't like to be looked at.

47:11.920 --> 47:14.116
Okay, I won't look at you, then.

47:19.600 --> 47:22.911
So, what about Joe?
Did he encourage you to keep writing?

47:23.800 --> 47:26.872
Yes, but, as I said,

47:28.280 --> 47:30.112
I didn't choose to pursue it.

47:31.400 --> 47:34.279
Because he was the writer of the family.

47:35.960 --> 47:39.874
Nathaniel, if you're trolling
for nuggets of bitterness,

47:40.000 --> 47:41.832
you'll find none here.

47:42.800 --> 47:43.916
Shucks.

47:49.440 --> 47:51.432
Now, speaking of bitterness,

47:52.320 --> 47:54.391
I spoke to his ex, Carol.

47:56.600 --> 47:57.795
How is she?

47:58.960 --> 48:01.680
She's good. She's a psychiatrist.

48:03.080 --> 48:04.799
- Good for her.
- Yeah.

48:05.480 --> 48:07.437
And their daughter, Fanny?

48:07.520 --> 48:09.113
Successful dentist.

48:10.720 --> 48:13.280
Rest assured,
Carol forgives you, by the way.

48:16.160 --> 48:17.160
I'm glad.

48:19.240 --> 48:21.800
Joe tried to keep in contact
with them...

48:22.600 --> 48:24.319
I actually urged him to,

48:26.320 --> 48:29.154
but we feel very badly
about that chapter in our life.

48:31.360 --> 48:34.000
Well, she wants to make sure

48:35.000 --> 48:38.676
that you know how thankful she is
that you took him off her hands.

48:40.960 --> 48:42.235
She's very welcome.

48:43.480 --> 48:46.598
Joan, I hope you know that

48:48.800 --> 48:53.079
his affairs have nothing to do with you.
It's a compulsion.

48:53.720 --> 48:59.159
I believe it's a deep-seated fear
of inadequacy.

49:00.760 --> 49:02.717
Aren't you the therapist.

49:05.960 --> 49:08.429
Do you have anyone that you confide in?

49:12.200 --> 49:13.270
No.

49:14.400 --> 49:16.198
And I don't really care to.

49:17.880 --> 49:20.156
I guess that's what makes you
so attractive.

49:21.320 --> 49:23.118
You're very mysterious.

49:25.080 --> 49:26.833
Are you flirting with me?

49:29.320 --> 49:31.357
Probably. Why not?

49:37.680 --> 49:39.751
You know I don't trust you.

49:48.320 --> 49:49.834
Oh, shit.

49:50.960 --> 49:52.235
My pills.

49:53.120 --> 49:54.120
Pills?

49:54.200 --> 49:56.078
Yeah. Blood pressure.

49:56.280 --> 49:58.112
I think I should get back to the hotel.

49:58.200 --> 49:59.395
Yeah.

50:00.840 --> 50:03.912
Here, hold this.
Let me give you something.

50:05.840 --> 50:07.069
God, where's my pen?

50:08.160 --> 50:09.389
Here it is.

50:11.360 --> 50:14.797
Let's see. "To...

50:15.640 --> 50:16.790
"Linea..."

50:17.680 --> 50:19.160
Is that with an M, or?

50:19.240 --> 50:20.833
No, it's two N's.

50:20.920 --> 50:22.593
Oh, shit.

50:24.800 --> 50:26.280
It doesn't matter.

50:26.800 --> 50:27.995
I should go.

50:28.680 --> 50:30.034
Will you find your way out?

50:30.840 --> 50:32.194
Yeah.

50:40.480 --> 50:41.800
Fuck it.

50:42.000 --> 50:45.630
I have read some of Joe's earlier work.

50:46.560 --> 50:49.234
Couple of short stories I came across,

50:49.320 --> 50:51.960
some obscure literary journals,

50:52.040 --> 50:55.636
and I hate to say it, Joan,

50:57.080 --> 50:58.594
but not very good.

50:59.800 --> 51:04.716
Well, early work is rarely readable.
I mean, you should know that.

51:05.200 --> 51:08.637
Yeah, but these didn't even have
a hint of his mature voice.

51:08.720 --> 51:12.760
In fact, your piece, <i>The Faculty Wife,</i>

51:14.160 --> 51:17.312
that reads much more like
early Castleman than these did.

51:18.400 --> 51:19.675
That's understandable.

51:20.800 --> 51:23.440
Joe had a very heavy hand as a teacher.

51:26.000 --> 51:27.275
Fair enough.

51:31.160 --> 51:34.836
When I spoke to Carol,
she said that it was very odd

51:34.920 --> 51:37.833
how much better his writing became
after he met you.

51:39.320 --> 51:40.959
That's very generous of her.

51:43.200 --> 51:44.680
With all respect,

51:45.760 --> 51:48.195
I think you are sick and tired

51:49.240 --> 51:50.469
of Joe Castleman.

51:50.560 --> 51:53.678
I think you're tired of his affairs,
tired of being invisible,

51:53.760 --> 51:57.993
tired of channeling your enormous talent
into creating the Castleman legend.

51:58.080 --> 51:59.720
I would think
for the sake of your family,

51:59.800 --> 52:03.032
for the happiness of your family,
you would wanna do something like this.

52:03.120 --> 52:05.680
David seems like
a very unhappy young man.

52:05.760 --> 52:09.720
You have no business
talking about my children.

52:11.360 --> 52:14.159
You're right. I'm sorry.

52:16.800 --> 52:19.110
I do think you want to talk to somebody.

52:21.320 --> 52:24.233
I give you my word,
I will never reveal my source.

52:25.680 --> 52:28.752
I will be the bad guy, so you don't
have to feel like you're betraying Joe.

52:28.840 --> 52:33.960
Then the truth will be out there.
You would be free to write on your own.

52:37.960 --> 52:40.270
What a marvelous story, Nathaniel.

52:41.920 --> 52:45.038
You really ought to write fiction.

52:51.080 --> 52:52.275
Joan...

52:53.440 --> 52:54.954
You know where I'll be.

52:56.760 --> 53:00.151
I really do want you to know that
I genuinely do enjoy your company.

53:22.880 --> 53:23.996
Joanie?

53:24.800 --> 53:26.120
Joanie, is that you?

53:27.000 --> 53:28.229
Yeah.

53:28.320 --> 53:30.596
Where have you been?
I've been worried sick about you.

53:31.120 --> 53:32.952
Why? It's only 4:30.

53:33.040 --> 53:34.997
Yeah, but look how dark it is already.

53:35.280 --> 53:37.920
Don't do this to me.
Don't disappear on me like this.

53:38.000 --> 53:41.994
I didn't disappear.
I went out for a couple of hours.

53:42.320 --> 53:43.959
So, what you been doing all day?

53:44.040 --> 53:47.431
Well, I walked around,
went into a couple of stores,

53:47.680 --> 53:50.434
looked in a couple of shops.
How did the rehearsal go?

53:50.720 --> 53:52.473
Joanie, have you been smoking?

53:53.160 --> 53:55.311
- I can smell it on you.
- I went into a cafe,

53:55.400 --> 53:57.198
and it was filled with smoke.

53:58.440 --> 54:00.033
Have you been drinking, too?

54:00.120 --> 54:01.839
Yeah, I had a vodka.

54:01.920 --> 54:03.195
In the middle of the day?

54:03.920 --> 54:05.479
Yes, Joe, in the middle of the day.

54:06.040 --> 54:07.416
You know, Joanie,
you can't be doing this.

54:07.440 --> 54:09.976
You can't be showing up at functions
with alcohol on your breath.

54:10.000 --> 54:14.074
You are the star of the big show,
so why would anyone possibly care?

54:14.160 --> 54:15.799
What the hell has gotten into you?

54:15.880 --> 54:19.032
I don't like to be lectured to.
I'm not a child.

54:20.680 --> 54:22.319
God damn it, Joe.

54:22.400 --> 54:23.400
- What?
- Are...

54:24.320 --> 54:26.656
Are you gonna stop throwing
your clothes all over the floor?

54:26.680 --> 54:27.856
- I am so sick and tired...
- Here.

54:27.880 --> 54:29.296
- ...of picking up after you.
- Let me do it.

54:29.320 --> 54:32.119
- What's that?
- I got hungry. I bought some walnuts.

54:32.520 --> 54:33.636
Let me see it.

54:34.440 --> 54:36.193
- It's just a walnut.
- Can I see it?

54:36.480 --> 54:37.976
What are you talking about?
"Can I see it?"

54:38.000 --> 54:39.000
Give it to me.

54:39.360 --> 54:40.776
- What are you doing?
- Give it to me.

54:40.800 --> 54:43.634
- Don't be ridiculous.
- Give it to me.

54:48.720 --> 54:52.191
So, while I was out
being a drunken lush,

54:52.600 --> 54:54.990
you were seducing the luscious Linnea?

54:55.080 --> 54:56.150
Nothing happened.

54:56.680 --> 55:00.117
Don't you dare insult my intelligence.
Don't you dare.

55:01.040 --> 55:02.599
Nothing happened.

55:02.680 --> 55:05.275
- I put a stop to it.
- Bully for you.

55:05.360 --> 55:08.671
Yeah, bully for me. And do you know why
I put a stop to it?

55:08.760 --> 55:12.197
Because I was worried about you
on some fucking tour bus,

55:12.280 --> 55:15.751
feeling neglected, so I come back here
so you wouldn't be alone.

55:15.840 --> 55:17.520
And what happens?
I end up waiting for you.

55:18.880 --> 55:20.519
I should have let you know I'd be late

55:20.600 --> 55:22.637
so you could finish fucking
your photographer!

55:22.720 --> 55:24.439
I wasn't gonna fuck her!

55:24.800 --> 55:26.473
I'm not even attracted
to the woman, okay?

55:27.120 --> 55:29.032
Look, all I was worried about was you.

55:29.120 --> 55:30.440
I'm touched.

55:32.000 --> 55:33.992
I'm too old for all this crap.

55:34.920 --> 55:35.956
I'm done with it.

55:36.720 --> 55:37.756
I'm all yours.

55:38.240 --> 55:39.435
Goody for me.

55:40.280 --> 55:41.714
Yeah, goody for you.

55:43.840 --> 55:45.240
- Hello?
<i>- Hi, Mom?</i>

55:45.360 --> 55:46.635
Susannah?

55:47.160 --> 55:48.310
<i>I had the baby.</i>

55:48.680 --> 55:49.750
What?

55:51.240 --> 55:52.435
Oh, my God.

55:52.960 --> 55:55.156
- What?
- Susannah had the baby.

55:55.240 --> 55:56.674
Get on the other line.

55:56.760 --> 55:58.274
When, darling? When?

55:58.360 --> 55:59.714
<i>A couple of hours ago.</i>

56:00.160 --> 56:01.674
Oh, my God.

56:02.880 --> 56:03.916
Are you okay?

56:04.360 --> 56:06.079
<i>I'm fine.</i>

56:06.480 --> 56:08.392
<i>He's making little mewling sounds.</i>

56:09.640 --> 56:10.994
You had a boy?

56:12.320 --> 56:14.596
- What are you gonna call him?
<i>- Max.</i>

56:17.040 --> 56:18.269
Max.

56:19.480 --> 56:20.834
Who does he look like?

56:21.520 --> 56:24.160
<i>Dad, I know you want me to say
that he looks like you, but...</i>

56:25.720 --> 56:27.536
Put the phone next to his ear.
I wanna talk to him.

56:27.560 --> 56:30.598
<i>Here, take the phone.
Dad wants to talk to Max.</i>

56:31.800 --> 56:32.995
Is he on?

56:35.120 --> 56:36.759
Hello, Maxwell.

56:39.840 --> 56:41.593
It's your Grandpa Joe.

56:43.840 --> 56:49.154
Hello, darling.
It's your grandma. Hello. Welcome.

56:52.040 --> 56:54.077
He's talking to us. Can you hear?

56:54.160 --> 56:57.517
You are the most beautiful little boy
in the world.

56:57.640 --> 57:00.838
I wish I was holding you in my arms
right this minute.

57:02.800 --> 57:06.271
<i>Dad, Mom, Mark's parents just got here.
I have to go.</i>

57:10.120 --> 57:11.713
You give him a big kiss from us.

57:12.080 --> 57:13.230
<i>I will.</i>

57:13.360 --> 57:16.398
Love you, darling. Love you so, so much.

57:16.480 --> 57:18.517
- Bye, sweetheart.
<i>- I love you too, Mom.</i>

57:18.600 --> 57:19.600
<i>Bye, Dad.</i>

57:19.680 --> 57:20.830
- Bye, darling.
- I love you.

57:20.920 --> 57:23.310
- Bye.
- Bye.

57:25.840 --> 57:26.910
Oh, Joan.

57:27.520 --> 57:29.477
Life doesn't get much better.

57:30.200 --> 57:31.634
Oh, my God.

57:36.560 --> 57:39.792
Say what you like about the crap
we put each other through.

57:40.120 --> 57:42.999
We still have a wonderful fucking life.

57:45.240 --> 57:48.756
You're a really gifted writer, David.

57:49.280 --> 57:50.475
But you know that.

57:51.160 --> 57:53.231
Thank you, Dad. I appreciate that.

57:54.080 --> 57:57.676
I liked your story. Well-constructed.

57:58.960 --> 58:00.110
But?

58:00.800 --> 58:04.714
Well, there's always a "but"
with the first draft.

58:06.400 --> 58:09.279
Come on. Do you wanna hear this?

58:10.720 --> 58:12.871
- Yeah, sure, go on.
- Okay.

58:12.960 --> 58:16.032
Well, I don't completely buy
what you did with the couple.

58:16.840 --> 58:21.312
The blowhard husband, the stoic wife
with the repressed rage.

58:22.000 --> 58:25.357
We've seen it before. It's a clichÃ©.

58:26.640 --> 58:29.439
I think you can do better.

58:30.480 --> 58:31.596
Jesus.

58:33.280 --> 58:34.600
Okay.

58:34.680 --> 58:36.592
It's all part of the process, David.

58:37.520 --> 58:39.955
It's painful. I know that.

58:40.320 --> 58:42.551
Writing can be fucking agony.

58:43.120 --> 58:45.191
Yes, darling, it's dreadful.

58:45.720 --> 58:47.598
You've suffered enormously.

58:50.480 --> 58:51.709
Time for bed, huh?

58:55.880 --> 58:58.270
- I'm gonna take your mother upstairs.
- Sure.

59:00.720 --> 59:03.440
You enjoy yourself.
Don't stay up too late.

59:04.120 --> 59:05.395
Night, darling.

59:06.120 --> 59:09.272
Call your sister.
She'd love to hear from you.

59:40.920 --> 59:42.195
Cigarette?

59:42.280 --> 59:44.590
Sorry. We don't sell
any cigarettes here.

59:44.960 --> 59:46.110
All right.

59:46.560 --> 59:47.789
You can have one of mine.

59:48.520 --> 59:50.273
- Hey.
- Hey.

59:50.360 --> 59:51.680
Thanks.

01:00:04.480 --> 01:00:05.630
I've been watching them.

01:00:06.600 --> 01:00:08.432
The girl likes to chew her hair,

01:00:08.520 --> 01:00:12.036
and the guy has got
some sort of weird twitch.

01:00:12.200 --> 01:00:14.635
Yeah. They're pretty screwed up.

01:00:16.360 --> 01:00:17.714
Well, aren't we all?

01:00:19.280 --> 01:00:21.511
You know, my dad was a teacher at Yale.

01:00:21.600 --> 01:00:25.389
He used to make me recite
the <i>Iliad</i> at dinner,

01:00:26.080 --> 01:00:27.230
in Greek.

01:00:28.360 --> 01:00:30.352
That's fucked up.

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:32.354
You haven't heard the half of it.

01:00:32.480 --> 01:00:34.437
And the really, really
fucked-up thing is,

01:00:34.520 --> 01:00:35.880
he didn't understand a word of it.

01:00:41.280 --> 01:00:42.953
What are we drinking, David?

01:01:22.280 --> 01:01:24.360
I have a writer who I think
is the next Henry Miller.

01:01:24.920 --> 01:01:28.231
He's a hopeless drunk and will probably
self-destruct in a few years,

01:01:28.320 --> 01:01:30.551
so I suggest we grab him now.

01:01:30.640 --> 01:01:32.040
All right, I'll give it a read.

01:01:32.120 --> 01:01:33.240
Honey, top me off, will you?

01:01:33.280 --> 01:01:35.556
I've a novel here by a lady writer.

01:01:35.640 --> 01:01:38.599
It's about an American family,
spans three generations.

01:01:38.680 --> 01:01:41.195
It's great writing, kind of brilliant.

01:01:41.280 --> 01:01:43.397
- But I thought it was a little soft.
- Soft?

01:01:44.080 --> 01:01:46.016
Well, it comes from the point of view
of this woman.

01:01:46.040 --> 01:01:47.554
I don't know. It just didn't grab me.

01:01:47.680 --> 01:01:49.000
- Is she good-looking?
- So-so.

01:01:49.080 --> 01:01:52.994
How about Jewish writers? Anyone have
any smart, young Jewish writers?

01:01:53.080 --> 01:01:55.959
All the big houses have one.
Where the hell is ours?

01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:58.150
Mr. Bower.

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:01.720
I think I may have
what you're looking for.

01:02:48.640 --> 01:02:51.200
So, I walked to Harlem and back,
I had five espressos,

01:02:51.280 --> 01:02:54.159
and I made my way through
a pack and a half of cigarettes.

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:56.719
You asked me to be honest.

01:02:58.600 --> 01:02:59.954
So, talk.

01:03:02.200 --> 01:03:05.238
I'm so sorry, Joe,
but it just doesn't work for me.

01:03:06.880 --> 01:03:07.880
What do you mean?

01:03:09.200 --> 01:03:11.032
Somehow it never comes alive.

01:03:11.760 --> 01:03:15.231
The subject is too close to you.
I should get a more objective opinion.

01:03:16.720 --> 01:03:18.757
Your characters are wooden, Joe.

01:03:21.240 --> 01:03:23.835
No offense,
but you didn't make them real.

01:03:23.920 --> 01:03:26.594
That doesn't mean anything.
Get specific.

01:03:29.120 --> 01:03:30.395
Well, for one thing,

01:03:31.680 --> 01:03:33.433
your dialogue is stilted.

01:03:34.920 --> 01:03:37.151
- Let me see if I can get an example.
- Fuck this.

01:03:37.240 --> 01:03:40.233
What the fuck?
Okay, this is not gonna work.

01:03:40.320 --> 01:03:42.357
- What isn't?
- This whole thing. You and me.

01:03:42.440 --> 01:03:44.296
This love affair of ours,
whatever you wanna call it.

01:03:44.320 --> 01:03:47.438
Joe, just because I don't love your
novel doesn't mean I don't love you.

01:03:47.560 --> 01:03:48.835
How could you love me

01:03:48.920 --> 01:03:50.434
- if you think I'm a hack?
- Joe.

01:03:50.520 --> 01:03:53.240
Look, how can I be with someone
who doesn't respect me?

01:03:53.320 --> 01:03:54.816
- I do...
- You have no respect for me.

01:03:54.840 --> 01:03:58.038
I do respect you.
I respect you in all kinds of ways.

01:03:58.120 --> 01:04:01.352
All kinds of ways. Well, fuck that.

01:04:01.480 --> 01:04:03.199
Tell me you believe in me as a writer.

01:04:03.280 --> 01:04:07.035
- It's only your first draft, Joe.
- Screw this, Joanie. It's over.

01:04:07.680 --> 01:04:08.830
This relationship's doomed.

01:04:08.920 --> 01:04:11.515
What am I supposed to do
when I'm back in...

01:04:14.200 --> 01:04:16.396
Go back and teach English
at some second-rate college?

01:04:16.480 --> 01:04:18.016
Since I obviously blew it
with the Ivy Leagues

01:04:18.040 --> 01:04:19.280
by screwing one of my students.

01:04:19.320 --> 01:04:21.915
I'm not just one of your students, Joe.

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.151
No, you're the girl
with the golden touch.

01:04:24.240 --> 01:04:25.800
You'll go on to be a literary sensation

01:04:25.880 --> 01:04:28.320
while I stay at home grading papers
and cooking the pot roast.

01:04:28.400 --> 01:04:31.518
I'm not gonna be a literary sensation,
you bastard, not ever.

01:04:32.080 --> 01:04:34.072
No one will ever publish my books,

01:04:34.160 --> 01:04:36.197
and even if they did,
no one would read them.

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:39.276
I'm not full of big ideas
the way you are.

01:04:40.200 --> 01:04:42.510
You're the one
that has something to say, not me.

01:04:46.200 --> 01:04:47.520
Please don't leave me.

01:04:48.680 --> 01:04:51.320
If I lose you, my life is over.

01:04:52.040 --> 01:04:53.759
I'm not going anywhere.

01:04:53.840 --> 01:04:55.797
I don't wanna live without you.

01:04:56.960 --> 01:04:59.111
I don't wanna live without you either.

01:05:00.680 --> 01:05:03.320
Joanie, life is so fucking unfair.

01:05:15.240 --> 01:05:18.392
Okay. Let's just calm down, all right?

01:05:18.960 --> 01:05:20.440
We'll be okay. Let's...

01:05:21.880 --> 01:05:24.440
Okay.

01:05:39.640 --> 01:05:40.835
What are we gonna do?

01:05:42.360 --> 01:05:44.636
I don't know. I just...

01:05:47.040 --> 01:05:48.554
Let me think.

01:05:53.480 --> 01:05:54.880
So, you think it's hopeless?

01:05:56.640 --> 01:05:57.960
This piece of shit I wrote?

01:05:59.240 --> 01:06:00.754
It's not a piece of shit, Joe.

01:06:03.640 --> 01:06:05.757
It's a very compelling story.

01:06:08.240 --> 01:06:10.357
All the ideas are there.

01:06:12.640 --> 01:06:14.120
I can see it.

01:06:17.160 --> 01:06:18.640
I could fix it.

01:06:24.280 --> 01:06:25.999
Do you want me to fix it?

01:06:29.880 --> 01:06:31.030
Joe?

01:06:47.440 --> 01:06:48.715
What did he say?

01:06:49.760 --> 01:06:50.830
He loved it.

01:06:50.920 --> 01:06:52.400
- They wanna publish it?
- Yeah.

01:06:52.520 --> 01:06:54.113
- They wanna publish it?
- Yes!

01:06:56.640 --> 01:06:57.676
Fuck!

01:06:58.760 --> 01:07:00.160
What are you doing?

01:07:00.680 --> 01:07:02.319
- Come here.
- Hold on.

01:07:03.880 --> 01:07:06.076
<i>- We're getting published
- Getting published</i>

01:07:06.160 --> 01:07:08.391
<i>We're getting published</i>

01:07:08.480 --> 01:07:10.631
<i>We're getting published</i>

01:07:12.120 --> 01:07:13.315
Where the hell is he?

01:07:13.640 --> 01:07:14.915
Joe, relax.

01:07:16.120 --> 01:07:17.270
Just relax, all right?

01:07:17.360 --> 01:07:19.511
If he doesn't show up,
we're leaving without him.

01:07:20.200 --> 01:07:22.840
- You see? There he is.
- Oh, God.

01:07:27.520 --> 01:07:28.795
- Hello, darling.
- Hey, Mom.

01:07:28.880 --> 01:07:30.030
Look how handsome you are.

01:07:30.160 --> 01:07:32.470
You're late. We gotta get going.

01:07:33.200 --> 01:07:35.160
- You got my glasses?
- Yeah, they're in my purse.

01:07:35.200 --> 01:07:37.510
- And the invitations?
- I don't think we'll need them.

01:07:37.600 --> 01:07:39.000
You never know.

01:07:39.080 --> 01:07:41.436
What the hell is going on with your tie?

01:07:41.520 --> 01:07:42.749
- Come here.
- No, I got it.

01:07:42.840 --> 01:07:44.399
Let me fix it.

01:07:46.320 --> 01:07:48.152
Keep still, will you?

01:07:51.680 --> 01:07:52.875
What?

01:07:55.560 --> 01:07:57.677
- What?
- You've been smoking pot.

01:07:57.800 --> 01:08:00.190
- No, I haven't.
- Yes, you have. I can...

01:08:00.680 --> 01:08:02.717
- You reek of it.
- Joe, calm down.

01:08:02.840 --> 01:08:04.911
No. Look at him.

01:08:05.400 --> 01:08:08.234
Oh, my God. The kid's completely stoned.

01:08:08.320 --> 01:08:10.789
I guess I'm a real embarrassment
to you, Pop.

01:08:10.880 --> 01:08:13.031
- What kind of hostile crap is that?
- Joe.

01:08:13.840 --> 01:08:16.036
David, what's going on?

01:08:16.399 --> 01:08:17.399
I don't know, Mom.

01:08:17.479 --> 01:08:20.040
I'm trying to figure out
if I've been worshiping

01:08:20.120 --> 01:08:22.032
at the wrong parental shrine.

01:08:22.560 --> 01:08:24.313
What the hell are you talking about?

01:08:26.200 --> 01:08:27.316
What are you talking about?

01:08:27.880 --> 01:08:29.279
Oh, my God. The kid's in a mess.

01:08:29.359 --> 01:08:31.256
- What are we gonna do with him?
- No, I'm not a pronoun, Pop.

01:08:31.279 --> 01:08:33.656
- I'm standing right here.
- Then talk to me, for Christ's sake!

01:08:33.680 --> 01:08:35.990
- Don't shout at him.
- Yes, I will!

01:08:37.120 --> 01:08:38.349
We're late.

01:08:38.800 --> 01:08:40.095
We're supposed to be in the limo.

01:08:40.120 --> 01:08:43.192
And already, he's spoiling my night
with his fucking bullshit.

01:08:43.279 --> 01:08:44.395
Is it?

01:08:45.319 --> 01:08:47.277
- Is it what?
- Your night.

01:08:48.120 --> 01:08:53.194
Because according to your biographer,
this could all be some brilliant fraud.

01:08:53.479 --> 01:08:55.118
What biographer?

01:08:55.200 --> 01:08:57.350
That guy on the plane
with the glasses and the hair.

01:08:57.439 --> 01:08:59.750
- Andy Warhol with pigment.
- Nathaniel Bone?

01:08:59.840 --> 01:09:02.274
He's not my fucking biographer.
What are you talking about?

01:09:02.359 --> 01:09:04.256
- He was in the bar last night.
- What did he say to you?

01:09:04.279 --> 01:09:08.274
He said that I shouldn't measure myself
against my venerable father's success

01:09:08.359 --> 01:09:10.158
because there is, in fact, a theory

01:09:10.680 --> 01:09:14.310
that you, my mother,
are the real genius of the family.

01:09:14.600 --> 01:09:16.000
That's ridiculous.

01:09:16.520 --> 01:09:18.398
Why would he make
such a twisted thing up?

01:09:19.479 --> 01:09:21.676
David, he's out to get me

01:09:22.120 --> 01:09:25.272
because I won't authorize
his hack job on my life.

01:09:25.920 --> 01:09:27.434
Don't be an idiot, David.

01:09:28.200 --> 01:09:29.600
- I'm not an idiot.
- All right.

01:09:29.680 --> 01:09:31.716
- Why would you call me that?
- Okay, calm down.

01:09:31.800 --> 01:09:33.376
But, of course, if what he said is true,

01:09:33.399 --> 01:09:36.471
then I really, really would be
a fucking idiot, wouldn't I?

01:09:36.960 --> 01:09:39.156
David, look,
I hate to state the obvious,

01:09:39.240 --> 01:09:41.037
but I think the pot
is making you paranoid.

01:09:41.120 --> 01:09:42.679
I'm not fucking paranoid.

01:09:42.760 --> 01:09:45.354
David, Nathaniel Bone is
an insidious man.

01:09:45.479 --> 01:09:48.040
He had no business saying
those kinds of things to you.

01:09:48.200 --> 01:09:50.078
He said you had a drink with him, too.

01:09:53.200 --> 01:09:54.395
Did you?

01:09:54.720 --> 01:09:55.790
I did.

01:09:56.240 --> 01:09:57.440
He approached me in the lobby.

01:09:57.560 --> 01:09:59.240
I thought it would be unwise
to rebuff him.

01:09:59.280 --> 01:10:01.840
- He said that you confessed.
- Confessed what?

01:10:02.240 --> 01:10:06.393
He said that you ghostwrite Dad's books.

01:10:06.480 --> 01:10:08.153
I never said that.

01:10:12.560 --> 01:10:13.630
Do you?

01:10:15.960 --> 01:10:18.077
No, David, I do not.

01:10:22.400 --> 01:10:23.993
I don't believe you.

01:10:25.440 --> 01:10:28.751
Well, darling,
I can't make you believe me.

01:10:29.400 --> 01:10:32.677
You know, you have to decide
what you believe yourself.

01:10:34.440 --> 01:10:36.796
David, it's all lies.
It's fucking outrageous.

01:10:36.920 --> 01:10:39.196
Dad, why were you always
closing the door on me,

01:10:39.720 --> 01:10:41.632
with her inside, when I was young?

01:10:41.720 --> 01:10:43.234
What the fuck was she doing in there?

01:10:43.360 --> 01:10:45.736
- What are you talking about?
- The fucking door to your office!

01:10:45.760 --> 01:10:48.480
It was always being slammed
in my face with her inside.

01:10:49.200 --> 01:10:51.157
No, your mother was proofreading.

01:10:51.400 --> 01:10:52.720
Proofreading?

01:10:52.880 --> 01:10:54.519
I don't fucking believe you!

01:10:54.640 --> 01:10:57.678
You asked Mom,
"Who the hell is Sylvia Fry?"

01:10:58.160 --> 01:11:00.550
You don't even know
who your own fucking characters are!

01:11:00.680 --> 01:11:02.496
- All right, now, that's enough.
- No, fuck you!

01:11:02.520 --> 01:11:03.656
- David, that's...
- Fuck you!

01:11:03.680 --> 01:11:05.000
- David!
- Fuck you.

01:11:05.080 --> 01:11:06.680
- David.
- You made a slave of my mother.

01:11:06.800 --> 01:11:08.792
David. Stop it.

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:10.229
- Fuck you.
- Calm down.

01:11:10.520 --> 01:11:12.477
Your father doesn't control me.

01:11:13.160 --> 01:11:14.879
It's all so fucked up.

01:11:15.080 --> 01:11:17.311
- Come on, David. Come on.
- I'm sorry.

01:11:17.400 --> 01:11:20.757
No. Come on. That's okay.

01:11:20.960 --> 01:11:23.634
- Mom.
- It's all right, darling.

01:11:25.400 --> 01:11:28.234
- I know it's not easy for you, son.
- It's all right.

01:11:28.960 --> 01:11:30.235
Get some rest.

01:11:30.640 --> 01:11:32.199
Order up some food.

01:11:33.760 --> 01:11:35.194
What do you say?

01:11:48.160 --> 01:11:50.197
Joan, we're not bad people.

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:18.789
This part where you're describing
her folding his clothes,

01:12:19.320 --> 01:12:20.549
that goes on too long.

01:12:20.640 --> 01:12:22.279
It's deliberate, Joe.

01:12:23.680 --> 01:12:26.479
It's about her boredom
while she waits for him to show up.

01:12:26.800 --> 01:12:28.598
You know, there's a rhythm to it.

01:12:28.680 --> 01:12:30.637
It's an endless list of the prosaic.

01:12:30.720 --> 01:12:31.870
I see.

01:12:32.040 --> 01:12:33.474
- That's good.
- Mommy!

01:12:33.640 --> 01:12:35.393
Well, if that is what you're doing...

01:12:35.760 --> 01:12:38.056
- I wanna show you something, Mommy.
- You need to take it further.

01:12:38.080 --> 01:12:40.117
- I got it.
- Mommy, I wanna show you something.

01:12:40.200 --> 01:12:42.056
I'll take care of this.
I'll be back in a little while, okay?

01:12:42.080 --> 01:12:43.753
- Look at me.
- David, come here, kiddo.

01:12:44.320 --> 01:12:45.595
Mommy!

01:12:46.080 --> 01:12:48.117
- Let's take him downstairs.
- Mommy!

01:12:48.840 --> 01:12:50.513
Mommy!

01:12:51.080 --> 01:12:53.754
Mommy, I wanna show you something.

01:12:54.520 --> 01:12:55.954
Mommy!

01:13:04.240 --> 01:13:08.359
<i>You have given us a vast, restless
and brilliant body of work.</i>

01:13:08.520 --> 01:13:13.311
With each book, Mr. Castleman,
you have challenged the novelistic form

01:13:13.520 --> 01:13:17.309
and reinvented the very nature
of storytelling and of prose.

01:13:18.320 --> 01:13:20.471
You are a master of style,

01:13:21.400 --> 01:13:24.916
yet your characters are intensely real,

01:13:25.480 --> 01:13:29.474
their journeys heartbreaking,
their portrayals intimate and deep.

01:13:31.160 --> 01:13:33.231
Dear Mr. Castleman,

01:13:36.200 --> 01:13:37.953
the humanity in your writing

01:13:38.040 --> 01:13:40.999
transcends the boundaries
of class and gender.

01:13:41.720 --> 01:13:43.916
You are a master of words,

01:13:44.440 --> 01:13:45.999
but, more importantly,

01:13:46.320 --> 01:13:49.119
you are a master
at portraying the human condition

01:13:49.200 --> 01:13:50.953
in all its complexities.

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:54.560
Mr. Castleman,
I would like to convey to you

01:13:54.640 --> 01:13:57.792
the warm congratulations
of the Swedish Academy

01:13:58.440 --> 01:14:01.672
as I now request you to receive
the Nobel Prize in Literature

01:14:01.760 --> 01:14:03.672
from His Majesty, the King.

01:15:13.720 --> 01:15:16.315
You brown the brisket in the pot.

01:15:16.480 --> 01:15:19.200
You add two cups of water, some ketchup,

01:15:19.920 --> 01:15:23.277
some garlic salt
and finally the secret ingredient,

01:15:24.560 --> 01:15:26.358
a tablespoon of instant coffee.

01:15:26.720 --> 01:15:29.440
This is a typical recipe
of the American Jewish culture?

01:15:30.600 --> 01:15:34.389
No, it's a typical reflection
of how terrible a cook my mother was.

01:15:36.560 --> 01:15:40.156
Excuse me, Your Majesty.
If I may lead Mr. Castleman to the dais.

01:15:40.240 --> 01:15:42.960
- Yes, of course.
- Yeah. Excuse me.

01:15:43.280 --> 01:15:46.079
- I'll be back.
- Yes, bravo. Please do.

01:15:49.160 --> 01:15:51.550
Tell me about yourself, Mrs. Castleman.

01:15:52.240 --> 01:15:53.993
Do you have an occupation?

01:15:55.080 --> 01:15:56.400
I do.

01:15:56.920 --> 01:15:58.559
And what is that?

01:16:00.680 --> 01:16:02.717
I am a kingmaker.

01:16:04.680 --> 01:16:07.434
You know, my wife will tell you
the same thing.

01:16:15.800 --> 01:16:18.634
Your Majesties, Your Royal Highness,

01:16:19.240 --> 01:16:20.879
ladies and gentlemen.

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:25.313
It is a great honor to introduce
the Nobel Prize winner in Literature,

01:16:25.480 --> 01:16:27.711
Mr. Joseph Castleman.

01:16:39.600 --> 01:16:43.310
I'm deeply grateful for the honor
you have given me.

01:16:46.840 --> 01:16:49.230
But really this honor should go...

01:16:56.560 --> 01:16:59.075
Really this honor should go
to someone else.

01:17:00.880 --> 01:17:02.360
My wife, Joan.

01:17:07.480 --> 01:17:10.837
Joan truly is my better half.

01:17:11.560 --> 01:17:14.553
She's made it possible for me to find

01:17:14.920 --> 01:17:16.274
the stillness,

01:17:16.800 --> 01:17:18.359
as well as the noise,

01:17:19.160 --> 01:17:21.880
to create my body of work.

01:17:22.680 --> 01:17:25.673
Without her, I certainly wouldn't be
standing up here tonight.

01:17:26.960 --> 01:17:28.474
I'd be at home,

01:17:29.960 --> 01:17:32.077
staring at a blank piece of paper,

01:17:32.800 --> 01:17:35.554
my mouth open in stupefaction.

01:17:42.480 --> 01:17:44.551
My wife is my sanity,

01:17:47.040 --> 01:17:48.440
my conscience,

01:17:51.120 --> 01:17:54.955
and the inspiration
for every decent impulse

01:17:55.520 --> 01:17:57.000
I have ever had.

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:01.753
Joan, you are my muse,

01:18:02.640 --> 01:18:03.960
my love,

01:18:05.640 --> 01:18:07.040
my soul.

01:18:10.640 --> 01:18:12.632
And I share this honor with you.

01:18:56.320 --> 01:18:57.549
Darling.

01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:02.559
- What are you doing?
- I'm leaving.

01:19:03.840 --> 01:19:06.200
- What are you talking about?
- No, it's okay. You can stay.

01:19:06.280 --> 01:19:08.078
- I just have to leave.
- Excuse me.

01:19:08.360 --> 01:19:09.510
Joan.

01:19:10.160 --> 01:19:11.958
Joan, listen. I want to talk to you...

01:19:12.280 --> 01:19:13.760
Oh, God.

01:19:14.120 --> 01:19:15.395
- No, it's okay.
- I'm so sorry.

01:19:15.520 --> 01:19:16.795
It's all right.

01:19:18.080 --> 01:19:19.594
- Come, my dear, come.
- Joan.

01:19:19.680 --> 01:19:21.016
I will take you to the powder room.

01:19:21.040 --> 01:19:22.713
I would like to go back to the hotel.

01:19:23.440 --> 01:19:27.559
If you tell me your dress size, I can
have a clean gown delivered to you.

01:19:27.640 --> 01:19:29.552
No, thank you. I'm done for the night.

01:19:31.120 --> 01:19:32.440
Oh, God.

01:19:33.800 --> 01:19:35.359
- Your award, sir.
- Thank you.

01:19:35.720 --> 01:19:38.633
Mrs. Castleman, I'm so very, very sorry
that this happened.

01:19:38.720 --> 01:19:39.720
I'm sorry.

01:19:43.080 --> 01:19:44.760
<i>Gustav, would you turn up
the heat, please?</i>

01:19:44.840 --> 01:19:45.840
Right away, sir.

01:19:45.920 --> 01:19:48.799
And would you give us some privacy?
Thank you.

01:19:49.440 --> 01:19:52.877
So we'll go to the hotel,
you'll change, we'll go back,

01:19:52.960 --> 01:19:54.394
make a quick appearance,

01:19:54.480 --> 01:19:56.949
and then we'll be done
with this whole fucking thing.

01:19:58.920 --> 01:20:00.434
I'm leaving you.

01:20:01.480 --> 01:20:03.496
- What are you talking about?
- I can't do this anymore.

01:20:03.520 --> 01:20:05.432
Don't be crazy. You're not leaving me.

01:20:05.600 --> 01:20:08.354
Don't act surprised
or heartbroken or shocked,

01:20:08.480 --> 01:20:10.711
none of which you could possibly be.

01:20:13.360 --> 01:20:16.797
Look, I know you didn't want me
to acknowledge you in my speech,

01:20:16.880 --> 01:20:19.520
but do you think everything
I said up there was for show?

01:20:20.600 --> 01:20:22.193
I meant every word of it.

01:20:22.480 --> 01:20:25.075
- God, give me some credit.
- What for?

01:20:26.840 --> 01:20:30.311
- For loving you.
- Oh, God, Joe.

01:20:30.480 --> 01:20:32.358
What?

01:20:34.720 --> 01:20:35.836
Here.

01:20:36.320 --> 01:20:37.993
- Here, take it.
- I don't want it.

01:20:38.200 --> 01:20:40.271
- It belongs to you.
- I don't want it. It's yours.

01:20:40.360 --> 01:20:42.591
It's all yours.
It has your fucking name on it!

01:20:42.720 --> 01:20:46.396
- Fucking take it.
- I don't want it.

01:20:47.760 --> 01:20:49.752
I don't want the fucking thing!

01:20:52.440 --> 01:20:53.669
What are you doing?

01:20:54.320 --> 01:20:55.720
What did you just do?

01:20:55.960 --> 01:20:57.189
- You have it?
- I found it.

01:20:57.280 --> 01:20:59.397
Thank God. Thank you.

01:21:21.840 --> 01:21:23.880
Joanie, come, sit down.
Sit where I can look at you.

01:21:23.960 --> 01:21:25.394
Come on. I wanna talk to you.

01:21:26.040 --> 01:21:27.997
- Do you want a drink?
- No, thanks.

01:21:31.280 --> 01:21:32.680
Listen, Joanie...

01:21:35.560 --> 01:21:38.280
Listen, there is nothing horrible

01:21:38.560 --> 01:21:41.917
or shameful or immoral about what we do.

01:21:42.960 --> 01:21:44.474
We're writing partners.

01:21:44.680 --> 01:21:47.639
We've created
a beautiful body of work together.

01:21:47.720 --> 01:21:50.235
You edit, Joe. That's all you do.

01:21:50.440 --> 01:21:53.592
I'm the one who sits at that desk
eight hours a day.

01:21:54.720 --> 01:21:56.996
Is that the way you see it? Really?

01:21:57.960 --> 01:22:01.920
All these years you've been sitting
in some giant stew of resentment?

01:22:04.240 --> 01:22:06.994
And what about all the years
I've been rubbing your back,

01:22:07.280 --> 01:22:09.590
bringing you tea, cooking you dinner,
watching the kids,

01:22:09.680 --> 01:22:11.911
so you could work without distraction?

01:22:14.160 --> 01:22:18.279
You don't think
there were times when it killed me

01:22:18.720 --> 01:22:20.837
that you were the one
with the golden touch?

01:22:23.320 --> 01:22:27.872
You think I wake up every morning
feeling even remotely proud of myself?

01:22:29.840 --> 01:22:33.038
But have I ever said
I'm done with this marriage,

01:22:33.320 --> 01:22:34.470
I'm walking away?

01:22:34.600 --> 01:22:36.990
- No, you had affairs.
- Oh, God.

01:22:37.400 --> 01:22:39.915
And I've regretted
every fucking one of them.

01:22:40.040 --> 01:22:43.556
Yeah, right, you'd sob in my lap,
and you'd beg me to forgive you,

01:22:43.640 --> 01:22:45.632
and I always would because, you know,

01:22:45.720 --> 01:22:48.872
somehow you convinced me
that my talent made you do it.

01:22:48.960 --> 01:22:51.395
- Oh, shit.
- And then when I was too angry

01:22:51.480 --> 01:22:53.711
or too furious or too hurt to write,

01:22:53.800 --> 01:22:56.076
you would give me
one of your famous back rubs,

01:22:56.200 --> 01:22:57.576
and you'd say, "Use it, Joanie. Use it."

01:22:57.600 --> 01:23:00.479
- I never said that.
- Yes, you did.

01:23:00.560 --> 01:23:02.096
Lucky for me I had somewhere to put it.

01:23:02.120 --> 01:23:04.715
I mean, critics loved the image
of Sylvia Fry, you know,

01:23:04.800 --> 01:23:07.031
scrubbing the tear stains
out of her dress.

01:23:07.120 --> 01:23:09.589
They just loved that,
another Castleman masterpiece.

01:23:09.680 --> 01:23:12.115
Your chest just swelled
when you read me those reviews.

01:23:12.200 --> 01:23:13.475
It actually swelled.

01:23:13.560 --> 01:23:14.760
And rather than being outraged

01:23:14.800 --> 01:23:17.416
and rather than thinking about
what this all was doing to our kids,

01:23:17.440 --> 01:23:18.874
I would watch you and I'd say,

01:23:18.960 --> 01:23:21.953
"Oh, my God,
how can I capture that behavior?

01:23:22.040 --> 01:23:23.633
"How can I put all that in words?"

01:23:23.720 --> 01:23:26.758
And you know what? I did, right here.

01:23:27.080 --> 01:23:30.710
Right here.
Yeah, another Castleman masterpiece.

01:23:31.560 --> 01:23:36.271
And let's see. This one I wrote
after you screwed, who was it?

01:23:36.360 --> 01:23:38.238
- Yeah, our third nanny.
- God.

01:23:38.560 --> 01:23:42.156
This book had nothing at all to do
with the fucking nanny.

01:23:42.240 --> 01:23:44.197
Yes, it did. It's on every single page.

01:23:44.280 --> 01:23:48.832
These are my stories,
my culture, my family, my ideas.

01:23:48.960 --> 01:23:53.398
My words, my pain,
my spending hours alone in that room

01:23:53.600 --> 01:23:57.150
turning your appalling behavior
into literary gold!

01:23:57.480 --> 01:24:00.314
What compelling ideas
did you ever fucking have?

01:24:00.480 --> 01:24:03.632
You were nothing but a privileged,
prissy little co-ed.

01:24:04.040 --> 01:24:07.670
The only decent story
you ever wrote alone was about Carol.

01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:10.117
You stole from my life even then.

01:24:13.080 --> 01:24:14.878
Shame on you, Joe.

01:24:17.760 --> 01:24:21.720
You loved holing up in the Village
with the big, bad Jew.

01:24:22.040 --> 01:24:24.111
You loved making your parents squirm.

01:24:24.240 --> 01:24:27.995
You got the literary life
and the house by the sea.

01:24:29.160 --> 01:24:33.313
You loved getting the nice clothes
and the travel and all the privileges

01:24:33.400 --> 01:24:37.235
without ever having to marry
some schmuck from a brokerage firm.

01:24:37.360 --> 01:24:40.239
- You got it all, my girl.
- Well, you can have it back.

01:24:40.800 --> 01:24:42.029
I don't want it.

01:24:42.880 --> 01:24:43.996
What are you doing?

01:24:44.760 --> 01:24:46.558
I'm going to spend the night
in David's room,

01:24:46.640 --> 01:24:49.030
and then when I get home,
I'm gonna call a lawyer.

01:24:49.320 --> 01:24:51.915
This is ridiculous. Joanie, we got kids.

01:24:52.280 --> 01:24:53.873
We got a grandchild.

01:24:54.320 --> 01:24:56.357
We've got friends we've known for years

01:24:56.440 --> 01:24:58.591
who are gonna start dying on us
one by one.

01:24:58.680 --> 01:25:00.160
Where you gonna be?

01:25:00.320 --> 01:25:02.994
You gonna be living alone feeling brave?
Is that what you want?

01:25:03.280 --> 01:25:05.496
Joanie, wait for me.
Don't walk away from me, God damn it!

01:25:05.520 --> 01:25:06.840
Don't touch me!

01:25:06.920 --> 01:25:08.195
Don't touch you?

01:25:09.840 --> 01:25:12.275
Joanie, we gotta talk this through.

01:25:12.680 --> 01:25:15.115
I can't do it anymore, Joe.

01:25:16.200 --> 01:25:17.440
I can't do it. I can't take it.

01:25:17.520 --> 01:25:19.671
I can't take the humiliation

01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:22.640
of holding your coat
and arranging your pills

01:25:22.800 --> 01:25:24.519
and picking the crumbs out of your beard

01:25:24.680 --> 01:25:26.496
and being shoved aside
with all the other wives

01:25:26.520 --> 01:25:28.557
to talk about some goddamn shopping trip

01:25:28.640 --> 01:25:32.714
while you say
to all the gathering sycophants

01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:35.993
that your wife doesn't write!

01:25:40.840 --> 01:25:44.914
Your wife, who just won the Nobel Prize!

01:25:46.400 --> 01:25:51.316
So, if I'm such an insensitive
and talentless fucking piece of shit,

01:25:51.400 --> 01:25:53.039
why the fuck did you marry me?

01:25:56.480 --> 01:25:57.755
Oh, God, Joe.

01:25:58.560 --> 01:26:00.836
No, I really wanna know.
Why did you marry me?

01:26:04.400 --> 01:26:05.754
I don't know.

01:26:07.360 --> 01:26:09.113
I can't think anymore.

01:26:09.800 --> 01:26:13.111
- Joanie, come here.
- I just wanna get out of this dress.

01:26:13.280 --> 01:26:14.919
Come here.

01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:16.275
Let me... Come here...

01:26:24.680 --> 01:26:26.797
- Joanie.
- Oh, God.

01:26:28.760 --> 01:26:30.672
- What?
- No.

01:26:31.840 --> 01:26:32.910
No.

01:26:35.480 --> 01:26:37.711
Fuck.

01:26:54.120 --> 01:26:55.395
What the fuck?

01:27:06.280 --> 01:27:07.509
Oh, God.

01:27:08.320 --> 01:27:09.470
What is it?

01:27:10.760 --> 01:27:12.160
Oh, my God. Here, lie down.

01:27:12.240 --> 01:27:13.959
- I hurt.
- Okay, lie down.

01:27:14.080 --> 01:27:15.912
- Oh, God.
- Lie back here.

01:27:17.280 --> 01:27:18.509
Here.

01:27:21.240 --> 01:27:22.310
Okay.

01:27:22.880 --> 01:27:24.360
I'm going to make a call.

01:27:27.200 --> 01:27:29.112
Yes, hello,
we're in the executive suite.

01:27:29.200 --> 01:27:31.237
I think my husband is having
a heart attack.

01:27:31.520 --> 01:27:35.594
Please send one. Yes,
as fast as possible. Thank you.

01:27:37.120 --> 01:27:39.316
- All right, darling.
- Oh, God.

01:27:39.440 --> 01:27:41.193
Okay, just remember you have to breathe.

01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:44.640
Very slowly. Right out. Okay.

01:27:45.560 --> 01:27:47.517
All right. Okay.

01:27:47.880 --> 01:27:48.996
- All right.
- I'm okay.

01:27:49.080 --> 01:27:50.496
- You're gonna be all right.
- I'm okay.

01:27:50.520 --> 01:27:52.318
Okay.

01:27:52.480 --> 01:27:55.075
Oh, Joanie.

01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:00.354
They're gonna come to us.

01:28:04.120 --> 01:28:05.440
Do you love me?

01:28:07.320 --> 01:28:08.640
Do you love me?

01:28:09.400 --> 01:28:11.517
Yes, I love you, Joe.

01:28:12.040 --> 01:28:13.872
I love you very much.

01:28:14.680 --> 01:28:15.830
Oh, God.

01:28:16.800 --> 01:28:18.553
You're such a good liar.

01:28:20.320 --> 01:28:21.879
How will I ever know?

01:28:31.720 --> 01:28:34.189
- Joe? Okay, Joe.
- Oh, God.

01:28:34.640 --> 01:28:37.519
Stay here, Joe. Stay with me.
Look at me, Joe.

01:28:37.800 --> 01:28:40.838
Stay here. Hang in there, Joe.

01:28:40.960 --> 01:28:43.031
Hang in there, Joe.

01:28:43.600 --> 01:28:47.594
Don't leave me, Joe. Joe?

01:28:51.280 --> 01:28:52.600
Mr. Castleman?

01:28:53.800 --> 01:28:55.314
Mr. Castleman, can you hear me?

01:29:05.120 --> 01:29:06.713
Sorry. You have to move.

01:30:18.240 --> 01:30:20.232
Would you like another, Mrs. Castleman?

01:30:20.360 --> 01:30:21.635
No, thank you.

01:30:23.040 --> 01:30:24.918
I don't know whether you remember me,

01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:27.037
but I served you
on the flight coming over.

01:30:29.560 --> 01:30:30.914
I remember.

01:30:31.800 --> 01:30:34.269
I'm so very sorry for your loss.

01:30:36.080 --> 01:30:37.355
Thank you.

01:30:38.520 --> 01:30:40.876
You know,
I see a lot of couples on my flights,

01:30:42.080 --> 01:30:43.833
and you and your husband...

01:30:44.320 --> 01:30:46.789
Well, I just wanted to say
that I could tell

01:30:47.600 --> 01:30:49.637
you had a wonderful relationship.

01:30:53.640 --> 01:30:54.790
How?

01:30:56.120 --> 01:30:59.318
Just something about the way
you were with each other.

01:31:01.120 --> 01:31:02.349
Excuse me.

01:31:08.400 --> 01:31:11.040
Nathaniel Bone would like
to speak with you.

01:31:13.840 --> 01:31:15.638
Would you like me to tell him
you're asleep?

01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:19.151
No, it's all right.

01:31:32.960 --> 01:31:34.360
I don't know what to say.

01:31:36.440 --> 01:31:37.715
I'm stunned.

01:31:39.840 --> 01:31:41.069
How are you doing?

01:31:41.600 --> 01:31:43.193
We're still in shock.

01:31:44.040 --> 01:31:46.271
Yeah. I think we all are.

01:31:47.760 --> 01:31:49.274
It's a lot to process.

01:31:50.840 --> 01:31:52.035
Nathaniel.

01:31:55.080 --> 01:31:56.116
Yes?

01:31:58.040 --> 01:32:00.271
What we were talking about
the other day...

01:32:00.960 --> 01:32:02.030
Yes?

01:32:04.280 --> 01:32:08.194
I want to say
that what you implied isn't true,

01:32:09.200 --> 01:32:13.114
and if you malign Joe's talent
in any way, I'll take you to court.

01:32:17.480 --> 01:32:20.393
Good luck, Nathaniel.
I'm sure you'll write a fine book.

01:32:40.080 --> 01:32:41.639
Did you hear any of that?

01:32:42.360 --> 01:32:43.396
Yeah.

01:32:46.640 --> 01:32:50.111
When we get home, I'm going to
sit you and your sister down,

01:32:51.800 --> 01:32:55.476
and I'm going to tell you everything.

01:32:59.920 --> 01:33:01.195
Okay, Mom.
