all those strange noises.

How could I forget.

00:07.875 --> 00:11.902
- We must've been helpless.
- That I'd have to agree with.

00:11.979 --> 00:17.474
Fritz, listen. You don't think
we were something like him?

00:19.019 --> 00:22.614
I don't think so.

00:22.689 --> 00:26.284
- Did you look at his hands?
- I'll bet he's never done anything.

00:26.360 --> 00:28.988
A wealthy family,
probably an only child.

00:29.062 --> 00:31.530
- Sometime get a look
at the way he walks.
- I did.

00:31.597 --> 00:34.931
[ Ernst ] Back home, we used
to call Jean Monteau a sissy.

00:35.001 --> 00:39.336
- Remember we were wishing
we could see some girls?
- Yeah?

00:39.405 --> 00:44.309

come closer to our wish and
still miss it completely.

That direction!
That's the way we've gotta go.

01:18.879 --> 01:22.508
We'll cross here. Doesn't look as
though it'll be over our heads.

01:22.583 --> 01:24.881
Do we have to cross
just here?

01:24.952 --> 01:28.080
It's easy.
Take off your clothes.

01:28.155 --> 01:30.715
Carry them
over your head.

01:30.791 --> 01:32.816
It's better than walking
around in wet clothes.

01:32.893 --> 01:35.054
It's just until we
get across the deep part.

01:35.128 --> 01:37.187
I can't swim.

01:37.264 --> 01:39.824
I don't think
you'll have to.

01:39.900 --> 01:42.061
Come on,
get started.

02:02.289 --> 02:05.258
I'm going back to the beach
to wait for my grandfather.

02:05.325 --> 02:07.384
Don't come
any closer!

02:07.461 --> 02:09.588
- Are you out of your mind?
-Stay back!

02:09.663 --> 02:12.097
That's my gun!
You've got no right to take it.

02:12.164 --> 02:15.931
I'm sorry, but I have
more need of it than you.

02:16.003 --> 02:18.631
I'll see my grandfather
makes it all right with you.

02:20.173 --> 02:22.437
Wait!

02:22.509 --> 02:25.637
You keep his attention.
I'll slip around behind.

his attention!

02:33.019 --> 02:36.148
Put that down or
I'll let this go!

02:37.289 --> 02:39.724
Drop it!

02:42.663 --> 02:45.791
Don't do that, Ernst.
I'll shoot!

02:53.840 --> 02:57.434
I don't want to shoot you, Ernst.
Now put that down!

Let me take him on!
I'll teach him to shoot at me.

03:21.601 --> 03:26.334
- It was my fault.
She didn't mean to fire.
- I could've been--

What did you say?
''She didn't--''

03:29.409 --> 03:31.343
[ Crying ]

03:31.411 --> 03:35.142
It's a girl!

03:35.215 --> 03:37.843
Why would a girl
dress up like that?

03:37.918 --> 03:41.318
It was because
of the pirates.

03:43.256 --> 03:48.193
My grandfather made me cut my hair
and dress like this because...

03:48.260 --> 03:51.196
he didn't want
them to know.

03:55.434 --> 03:58.528
At least now
you can wash your face.

04:00.106 --> 04:03.042
It will be nice
to be called Roberta again.

04:03.110 --> 04:07.046
I'm sorry, but if we would've
known you were a girl...

- we wouldn't have--
- We'll try to make it easy for you.

As much as possible.

[ Fritz ]
Careful.

04:19.559 --> 04:23.222
- Give me your hand.
- Thank you.

04:23.296 --> 04:26.891
- Careful... Roberta.
- Watch your step.

04:32.838 --> 04:34.773
Thank you, Fritz.

04:51.258 --> 04:55.057
- Variations and deviations
are two different things.
- Hmm?

04:55.128 --> 04:57.392
Like here, Roberta.

04:57.463 --> 05:00.297
Variations can be compensated for
mathematically.

05:00.367 --> 05:04.861
But deviations, you never know
when they're going to happen.

05:04.938 --> 05:07.702
Wait till my grandfather
gets to know you.

05:07.774 --> 05:11.141
He'll put you to work
navigating one of his ships.

05:11.211 --> 05:15.443
- Would you like that?
- Maybe. Someday.

05:15.515 --> 05:17.983
I'd like to
finish school first.

05:18.051 --> 05:20.611
Do you like the sea,
Fritz?

05:20.687 --> 05:22.711
I like things
you can depend on.

05:22.789 --> 05:25.222
The sea? You can
never be sure of it.

05:25.292 --> 05:27.624

not being sure of things.

05:49.015 --> 05:51.575
That's one of the most
beautiful things written.

05:51.651 --> 05:56.144
When we were caught in the storm, I was
thinking of those lines over and over.

05:56.222 --> 05:58.157
Do you read a lot,

doesn't read at all.

06:28.855 --> 06:31.846
I think we're

We should bear
more to the right.

to get along without it.
- Get along without it?

need a compass.

about as well without it.

20:47.747 --> 20:50.409
There might have been
all kinds of hardships.

20:50.483 --> 20:54.351
Think of the things you
might have had to do without.

20:57.556 --> 20:59.717
Take a look.

21:06.265 --> 21:08.733
It's beautiful.

21:08.801 --> 21:11.530
I've always wanted
a daughter...

21:11.604 --> 21:14.731
someone I could dress up
and make clothes for.

21:14.806 --> 21:16.934
I just didn't expect her
for Christmas.

21:17.009 --> 21:19.375
Thank you.

21:19.444 --> 21:22.881
How 'bout we get some trees,
bend them, make snares.

21:22.948 --> 21:25.882
The pirates step in the snares,
trip the mechanism...

21:25.951 --> 21:27.885
and whoosh,
they're caught?

21:27.953 --> 21:31.115
How can we defend
this place?

21:31.190 --> 21:35.387
What we need is a hill
so they have to come up to us.

21:35.461 --> 21:38.520
- I got an idea.
- What is it, Francis?

21:38.596 --> 21:42.896
We could dig
some big pits.

21:42.967 --> 21:45.368
We could put lions,
tigers and snakes...

21:45.436 --> 21:48.372
and all sorts
of animals in there.

21:48.440 --> 21:51.101
[ Francis ]
When the pirates come, they fall in.

21:51.177 --> 21:56.046
I don't know whether we could manage
the lions and tigers...

21:56.114 --> 21:58.708
but a few pits...

21:58.784 --> 22:02.220
-might be a very good idea.
- Nyaah!

22:13.798 --> 22:16.632
You look very
beautiful, my dear.

22:16.702 --> 22:18.966
Come and
join the family.

22:19.038 --> 22:22.439
Allow me, Roberta.

22:25.476 --> 22:27.411
Well, ah--

22:27.546 --> 22:30.845
May I have the pleasure
of the first dance?

23:01.512 --> 23:03.140
Whee!

23:19.297 --> 23:22.461
There you are.
What did I tell you?

23:22.534 --> 23:25.833
Anything we really need,
the island will produce it, even a girl.

23:25.904 --> 23:29.136
A girl?
But we have three sons.

23:44.590 --> 23:47.150
Excuse me, Fritz.

23:48.327 --> 23:50.318
Hey!

23:57.069 --> 23:59.003
I'll dance with you,
Fritz.

23:59.070 --> 24:02.336
I'll rest a while,
if you don't mind.

24:09.114 --> 24:13.846
- What's the matter?
- I was just thinkin'.

24:13.918 --> 24:17.115
We gotta have those
lions and tigers...

24:17.189 --> 24:20.784
or else--
well, that's the whole idea.

24:22.427 --> 24:26.023
- I guess we'll just
have to have them then.
- Yeah.

24:51.289 --> 24:54.123
Since you have a partner,
I'm sure you won't mind.

25:04.069 --> 25:08.233
It might have been simpler if I'd left
the dress in the bottom of the chest.

25:08.306 --> 25:10.297
Keep playing.

25:11.643 --> 25:14.009
Oh, thank you.

25:16.715 --> 25:20.082
Come on, Francis.
May I have the pleasure?

25:22.488 --> 25:24.251
[ Francis ]
Yippee!

25:26.190 --> 25:28.454
Yippee!

25:31.764 --> 25:34.324
Yippee!

25:51.884 --> 25:54.478
Something must've
gone wrong with the fuse.

25:54.552 --> 25:57.545
Well, we're not going back
to find out.

25:57.623 --> 26:00.489
We'll have to pick up
every scrap of lumber.

26:00.559 --> 26:02.788
We can't leave
any evidence.

26:04.296 --> 26:07.458
Must be getting close.

26:12.203 --> 26:14.331
Kaboom!

26:14.405 --> 26:17.864
Kaboom!
Kaboom!

26:19.645 --> 26:22.045
I used to dream
that somehow...

26:22.114 --> 26:24.673
we'd find a way
to make her sail again.

26:24.750 --> 26:27.344
Now--

26:44.802 --> 26:48.329
Well, we can
be sure of one thing.

26:48.407 --> 26:50.739
If the pirates do come...

26:50.809 --> 26:53.538
We're going to be outnumbered
maybe ten to one.

26:55.614 --> 26:59.243
[ Father ] But up here if we prepare
everything in advance...

26:59.318 --> 27:02.412
I think we'll give a
very good account of ourselves.

27:02.488 --> 27:05.615
We'll be just like
medieval knights defending the castle.

27:05.690 --> 27:08.784
We'll keep the muskets...

27:08.860 --> 27:11.523
for our final defense.

27:11.596 --> 27:14.087
And I'll give the order
when to use them.

27:14.166 --> 27:17.863
Of course, if anything
should happen to me...

27:17.936 --> 27:20.597
then Fritz will
take charge, then Ernst.

27:20.672 --> 27:22.537
And then me.

27:22.608 --> 27:25.873
Yes, then you, Francis.

27:25.944 --> 27:29.710
We've only got a small army.
We can only afford one general.

27:29.780 --> 27:33.046
Now, that's
our weak point.

27:33.118 --> 27:35.211
And this is where
they'll try to come up.

27:35.287 --> 27:39.485
- We could've used the cannon.
- We'll have to do the
best we can without it.

27:39.557 --> 27:44.722
Down there we'll put our pits,
snares and entanglements.

27:44.796 --> 27:48.663
Maybe we could plant some gunpowder and
touch it off with fuses from the top.

27:48.734 --> 27:51.635
Anything we can think of
to hold them up.

27:51.703 --> 27:56.402
You can rely on me, Roberta.
I've got it all worked out.

27:56.475 --> 27:59.569
And I take care of the
lions and tigers and things.

27:59.645 --> 28:02.909
- Right, Francis.
You're in charge of the tigers.
- Good.

28:07.552 --> 28:10.920
The thing about me is that
I'd like to be something in the world.

28:10.989 --> 28:13.457
That's why
I want to go to school.

28:13.525 --> 28:16.585
You'd love it
in London.

28:16.662 --> 28:19.927
There are concerts,
parties, dances...

28:19.998 --> 28:24.662
ladies in beautiful gowns,
elegant men in tall hats.

28:24.735 --> 28:26.670
Did you ever
own a tall hat?

28:26.738 --> 28:29.002
No.

28:29.074 --> 28:31.269
I can't wait
to see you in one.

28:31.342 --> 28:33.833
You'll be
quite handsome.

28:35.681 --> 28:39.378
That's what I miss most,
the color and excitement.

28:42.453 --> 28:45.945
I know I'd especially like it
if you were there.

28:48.193 --> 28:50.525
I'll be there.

28:50.596 --> 28:53.827
As long as I live, I don't think
I shall travel any further from home...

28:53.899 --> 28:57.231
than an occasional trip
to the seaside.

28:57.302 --> 28:59.735
Thank you, Roberta.

28:59.805 --> 29:03.332
[ Roberta ] There must be something
my grandfather can do for you.

29:03.408 --> 29:05.342
[ Ernst ]
Herr Kobel used to say...

29:05.409 --> 29:08.072
''For some boys,
school is a punishment;

29:08.145 --> 29:10.739
for others,
a reward.''

29:10.815 --> 29:15.412
There must be something
my grandfather can do.

29:21.560 --> 29:24.893
Francis, don't!

29:24.962 --> 29:27.829
If you drop that
you could blow us to pieces.

29:27.899 --> 29:31.561
That wouldn't set it off.
You'd have to light the fuse.

29:31.636 --> 29:35.198
- Even then I'm not so sure.
- You don't think they'll work?

29:35.274 --> 29:39.266
They may make noise, keep the pirates
confused. That's all they're good for.

29:39.344 --> 29:42.336
Just because Papa thought
of them instead of you!

29:43.914 --> 29:47.407
Hey, what's all this?
More pirate alarms?

29:47.485 --> 29:49.578
Yes, for over there
on the steep side.

29:49.654 --> 29:51.555
You and your
pirate alarm!

29:54.693 --> 29:57.287
What about your tiger?
Have you caught him yet?

29:57.362 --> 29:59.956
No. Until Fritz
and Ernst dig the pits...

30:00.032 --> 30:03.364
- I don't have anyplace to keep him.
-[ Fritz ] Ernst, Roberta!

30:03.435 --> 30:05.231
One of you give me a hand,
will you?

30:05.304 --> 30:08.364
- It's all right, I'll go.
- Don't bother.

30:09.807 --> 30:14.302
Up there, pull the knot
as tight as you can.

30:16.547 --> 30:19.210
Francis,
put that down!

30:25.056 --> 30:28.220
Is that all right?

30:31.395 --> 30:33.421
Good!

30:55.886 --> 30:57.945
There we are.

30:58.023 --> 31:00.014
What are you doing?

31:00.092 --> 31:03.083
He was showing me
how it will work.

31:05.931 --> 31:09.332
I feel sorry for any pirates
who come creeping around here.

31:09.400 --> 31:11.869
It was my idea,
don't forget.

31:11.936 --> 31:15.429
If you'd like, I'll show you
what else I had in mind.

31:54.479 --> 31:56.673
Pirates.
They're here.

31:56.748 --> 31:59.307
Into the fort, everybody.
Come on, Mother, quick.

32:01.286 --> 32:03.583
- What is it?
- Francis? Where is he?

32:03.654 --> 32:06.851
You know those
coconut bombs?

32:06.925 --> 32:10.019
You don't have to worry about them.
They work right well.

32:10.095 --> 32:12.893
Come down.
You might have been killed.

32:12.963 --> 32:16.331
If you had stayed where
you were supposed to, Ernst,
this wouldn't have happened.

32:16.400 --> 32:18.369
You can't tell me
what to do.

32:18.436 --> 32:21.201
-[ Fritz ] I just did.
- That's enough.

32:21.273 --> 32:25.038
I don't care. He thinks he can give
orders and get anyone to slave for him.

32:25.110 --> 32:28.546
Ernst, I said
that's enough!

32:28.613 --> 32:32.548
This incident's closed.
Let's get back to work.

32:35.086 --> 32:38.020
And I don't want to hear
another word about it.

32:51.302 --> 32:56.069
If you really don't want to go
to school, and your mind is made up...

32:56.141 --> 32:59.132
maybe my grandfather
could give you a job.

32:59.211 --> 33:01.702
It'll be a good job,
Fritz...

33:01.779 --> 33:04.248
perhaps in
the counting house.

33:04.315 --> 33:07.944
What if he doesn't get back here
for one reason or another?

33:08.019 --> 33:11.546
What if we have to stay on this island
for ten or twenty years?

33:11.623 --> 33:13.921
He will come back,
I know it.

33:13.992 --> 33:19.430
He's probably out there now headed
this way in one of his fastest ships.

33:21.032 --> 33:24.331
You'll take the job if he
offered it, wouldn't you?

33:26.872 --> 33:28.931
It's not that I wouldn't
appreciate it...

33:29.007 --> 33:30.940
but it's
just not for me...

33:31.009 --> 33:34.001
cooped in an office,
counting somebody else's money...

33:34.078 --> 33:36.172
doing the same thing
day after day.

33:36.248 --> 33:39.649
What would you like
to do?

33:39.717 --> 33:43.619
If we get off this island, I'd like
to do what we started out to do.

33:43.688 --> 33:46.418
Go on to New Guinea
and become part of the new colony.

33:46.490 --> 33:49.619
Maybe take up some land
in my own name.

33:50.494 --> 33:52.429
Why?

33:54.332 --> 33:56.800
Why?

33:56.868 --> 33:59.701
Because it's a good thing.

33:59.770 --> 34:02.672
You've got a chance to build
with your own two hands.

34:02.740 --> 34:07.337
It's the beginning of a new country.
That's what I like about it.

34:08.880 --> 34:10.938
I'm going to London.

34:13.685 --> 34:15.846
Ernst was
very flattering.

34:15.920 --> 34:18.514
He said he'd like
to be there if I was.

34:21.293 --> 34:24.194
Well, wouldn't you like
to see me in London?

34:26.764 --> 34:29.460
I don't know that
I'll ever be in London.

34:38.710 --> 34:42.237
I don't see how anybody
can shoot a thing like this.

34:45.951 --> 34:49.216
Fritz, why don't you
teach me how to shoot?

34:51.456 --> 34:54.152
It might be important
if there's a battle.

34:54.225 --> 34:56.750
All right.
Come on.

35:01.766 --> 35:04.257
Well, first...

35:04.336 --> 35:07.237
you pull the gun
tight into your shoulder.

35:07.305 --> 35:09.534
And, uh...

35:10.842 --> 35:14.938
Well, here.
Tight into your shoulder.

35:15.012 --> 35:19.109
And, uh, right hand
near the trigger.

35:19.184 --> 35:21.048
No, no!
Here.

35:21.119 --> 35:24.577
Left hand out to support it.
A little more. Right.

35:24.655 --> 35:29.217
No, no. You have to use
this hand to support it.

35:29.293 --> 35:33.287
Ah, now you sight
along the barrel here.

35:33.364 --> 35:35.525
I hope you don't mind.

35:35.600 --> 35:39.365
Why do you think
I wanted you to teach me?

35:48.113 --> 35:52.811
-[ Ernst ] Roberta, where are you?
- I'm over here.

35:54.485 --> 35:57.250
May I have this
next dance, milady?

36:00.525 --> 36:02.652
You said that's what
you missed most of all.

36:02.726 --> 36:04.786
I thought maybe I could
make you feel at home.

36:04.863 --> 36:06.557
Wherever
did you get that?

36:06.631 --> 36:08.826
You wish the name of
my tailor, my good man?

36:08.900 --> 36:11.266
Go past the town square,
take the first street left.

36:11.336 --> 36:15.466
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha. I thought you
were supposed to be covering the pits.

36:15.539 --> 36:18.940
And I thought you were supposed
to be working on the bridge.

36:19.010 --> 36:23.140
- He was teaching me how to shoot.
I asked him to.
- Fritz?

36:24.682 --> 36:27.173
Come here a minute.
I wanna show you something.

36:31.690 --> 36:35.956
If you'd like to learn how to shoot,
Roberta, I'd be happy to teach you.

36:36.027 --> 36:39.190
I think I have
the general idea.

36:48.873 --> 36:51.807
You know, Fritz,
the ol' tiger...

36:51.876 --> 36:56.471
he'll come along at night
after the pit's been all covered up...

36:56.547 --> 36:59.676
and he'll sniff
the meat.

36:59.751 --> 37:02.548
And he'll start
to circle the pit.

37:02.619 --> 37:06.488
[ Growling, Sniffing ]

37:06.557 --> 37:09.458
He'll come around here...
[ Growling ]

37:09.527 --> 37:11.927
and he'll think...

37:11.996 --> 37:15.625
''I think I just might grab
that big hunk of meat.''

37:15.699 --> 37:18.100
So he gets down like this...

37:18.168 --> 37:21.661
and he gets like this,
and then--

37:23.641 --> 37:26.132
I think you better just
tell me, not show me.

37:26.211 --> 37:28.940
Otherwise you'll be in there
before that tiger of yours.

37:29.012 --> 37:31.846
Anyhow, he'll jump
for the bait...

37:31.916 --> 37:35.113
- and that's how I'll catch my tiger.
- Ha!

37:35.186 --> 37:38.177
Do you think a tiger's
going to fall for this?

37:38.256 --> 37:39.689
You're wasting
your time.

37:42.060 --> 37:44.654
You talk about
wasting time, Ernst.

37:44.729 --> 37:47.823
How many hours did you spend
making that silly hat?

37:47.899 --> 37:50.128
That's none of your business.
You're not my boss.

37:50.201 --> 37:53.693
No. Ernst, we've got more
important things to do...

37:53.771 --> 37:57.037
- than try to amuse Roberta.
- You're jealous.

37:57.108 --> 38:00.976
Jealous? Of what?
Why don't you grow up?

38:05.350 --> 38:07.511
That's enough, Ernst.

38:15.360 --> 38:18.989
[ Francis ]
Fight, fight! Now you hit him, Fritz!

38:19.063 --> 38:20.324
Ow!

38:20.398 --> 38:22.662
Come on, Fritz, get him!

38:22.734 --> 38:24.860
Get him, Fritz!

38:24.936 --> 38:26.335
Fight, fight!

38:29.407 --> 38:32.001

57:48.493 --> 57:51.087
- Look out, Ernst!
- Father, look out!

57:56.101 --> 57:59.092
[ Screaming ]

58:02.908 --> 58:06.309
Ernst, look!

58:09.713 --> 58:11.978
[ Gunshots ]

58:12.050 --> 58:14.347
Roberta,
stay back.

58:26.030 --> 58:29.159
- [ Gasping ]
- [ Yelling ]

58:31.636 --> 58:34.503
[ Gunshots ]

58:59.064 --> 59:00.998
Get down, Roberta!

59:01.065 --> 59:04.092
[ Gasping ]

59:06.404 --> 59:11.239
[ Native Language ]

59:11.309 --> 59:14.869
- How many rounds have we got left?
- Five.

59:17.515 --> 59:20.177
-[ Gunshots ]
-[ Cannon Firing ]

59:20.251 --> 59:23.778
Not getting very close.

59:25.289 --> 59:28.020
[ Indistinct Yelling ]

59:32.931 --> 59:36.458
They're running away.

59:36.534 --> 59:39.435
- They're running away!
-[ Cannon Firing ]

59:45.710 --> 59:49.373
[ Native Language ]

59:55.854 --> 59:59.984
[ Father ] It's a ship, a merchantman!
They're firing on the pirates!

01:00:00.057 --> 01:00:02.492
[ Roberta ] It looks like
one of my grandfather's ships.

01:00:08.132 --> 01:00:10.931
I knew he'd
come for us.

01:00:15.373 --> 01:00:18.831
Yippee!
Here we are, up here!

01:00:18.909 --> 01:00:22.106
[ Cheering And Yelling ]

01:00:22.180 --> 01:00:25.637
Can I see
your hat, please?

01:00:25.717 --> 01:00:28.777
- This? Of course, my boy.
- Thank you.

01:00:32.990 --> 01:00:35.458
No more, thank you.
That was delicious.

01:00:35.527 --> 01:00:39.520
There's nothing to it. I've been making
donations to that college for years.

01:00:39.596 --> 01:00:41.690
About time I
asked for something.

01:00:41.766 --> 01:00:45.930
Roberta and I have
talked about school...

01:00:46.003 --> 01:00:48.494
but a university...
I never dreamed!

01:00:48.573 --> 01:00:50.507
I'm going
to a university!

01:00:50.574 --> 01:00:55.274
And as for the rest of you,
I won't try to influence you.

01:00:55.346 --> 01:00:57.974
But if you'd like
to return to Europe...

01:00:58.048 --> 01:01:01.347
I think I could make things interesting
and give you a fresh start.

01:01:01.418 --> 01:01:05.219
If you still want to go on to
New Guinea, I'll be happy to take you.

01:01:10.528 --> 01:01:14.555
I think that since
we have to decide forever...

01:01:14.632 --> 01:01:19.034
that my husband and I would...
rather stay here.

01:01:24.708 --> 01:01:27.041
Are you sure that's
what you want?

01:01:27.112 --> 01:01:29.342
Mmm-hmm.

01:01:29.413 --> 01:01:32.645
Ah, it's been a
good life for us here.

01:01:32.717 --> 01:01:36.016
As Roberta says, there are some things
you have to do without.

01:01:36.087 --> 01:01:40.489
How unimportant they seem when you
don't have people feeling sorry for you.

01:01:40.557 --> 01:01:43.527
You mean,
I don't have to go!

01:01:43.595 --> 01:01:47.429
- Yippee!
- Fritz and Ernst will go with you.

01:01:47.498 --> 01:01:50.400
I think we should
keep Francis here for a few years.

01:01:52.069 --> 01:01:53.537
I'll be back.

01:01:53.605 --> 01:01:56.664
You won't be without
neighbors, you realize.

01:01:56.740 --> 01:02:01.235
This is a new island. There'll
be a new colony, a new governor.

01:02:01.311 --> 01:02:03.404
They might make
you governor, Father!

01:02:03.480 --> 01:02:08.418
[ Captain ]
More than likely, I should say.

01:02:20.597 --> 01:02:23.965
- Hello.
- Oh.

01:02:28.273 --> 01:02:33.266
Funny, isn't it, how you can change
your mind about what's important?

01:02:33.344 --> 01:02:36.471
What it is
you really want?

01:02:36.547 --> 01:02:38.708
Take your parents.

01:02:38.783 --> 01:02:41.581
All of this time they've been
wanting to get to New Guinea.

01:02:41.653 --> 01:02:46.056
Now they find out
everything they want is right here.

01:02:46.123 --> 01:02:49.719
You mean
they're not going?

01:02:49.793 --> 01:02:52.557
I can understand
how they feel.

01:02:52.630 --> 01:02:55.929
I do too.

01:02:56.000 --> 01:03:00.561
Two people, if they
have each other...

01:03:00.637 --> 01:03:02.730
what more
could they want?

01:03:07.478 --> 01:03:09.503
I guess...
just to be alone.

01:03:25.496 --> 01:03:27.690
Fritz? Roberta?

01:03:27.765 --> 01:03:29.756
It's time to go now.

01:03:29.833 --> 01:03:32.701
- Captain wants to sail with the tide.
-Just coming.

01:03:38.842 --> 01:03:43.007
Surely you'll want
to see him off.

01:03:43.081 --> 01:03:46.949
Anyway, I'll have to
explain to my grandfather.

01:03:51.855 --> 01:03:54.154
- Bye, Ernst.
- Bye, Ernst.

01:03:54.225 --> 01:03:56.523
- Come back next year.
- Good-bye!

01:03:56.594 --> 01:03:59.859
Good-bye Mother,
Father, Fritz, Roberta.

01:03:59.931 --> 01:04:02.456
- Good-bye, everybody.
- Good-bye, Ernst.

01:04:04.235 --> 01:04:06.465
God be with you.

01:04:06.537 --> 01:04:10.064
[ Francis ]
Hey, wait for me. Duchess, Clementine!

01:04:10.141 --> 01:04:13.235
- Turk!
- [ Barking ]

01:04:13.311 --> 01:04:16.302
Duke, wait for me!
