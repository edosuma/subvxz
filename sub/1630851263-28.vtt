What up, Doom Patrol?

00:43.217 --> 00:45.871
Beast Boy!

00:45.915 --> 00:49.571
I'm so happy
that my baby...

00:49.614 --> 00:52.356
Uh, it's good to be home, Moms.

00:52.400 --> 00:54.358
Hey, big bro,
you want to meet my new friend?

00:54.402 --> 00:56.360
- Sure.
- His name is Mr. Turkey.

00:56.404 --> 00:58.362
And I made him
out of last year's leftovers.

00:58.406 --> 01:00.799
Uh, it's nice
to meet you, Mr. Turkey.

01:00.843 --> 01:04.412
Please call me Sal,
because I'm full of salmonella.

01:06.327 --> 01:08.242
That's so gross.

01:08.285 --> 01:10.287
Happy turkey time, Beast Boy.

01:10.331 --> 01:12.028
Same to you, Robotman.

01:12.072 --> 01:14.422
Oh, perhaps you'd care
to wrestle in the fall leaves.

01:14.465 --> 01:16.859
We could dislocation
so many of the body parts.

01:16.902 --> 01:18.774
That sounds great, yo!

01:20.776 --> 01:21.864
What up, Chief?

01:21.907 --> 01:24.040
Beast Boy! Hello there.

01:25.433 --> 01:26.782
Make sure you
and your robot brother

01:26.825 --> 01:28.610
stay away from the TV remote.

01:28.653 --> 01:31.091
But I do not want to watch
the football all day's long.

01:32.309 --> 01:33.789
I want to watch
the happy puppies

01:33.832 --> 01:35.312
in the <i>Dog Dog Show Show.</i>

01:35.356 --> 01:37.184
I want to watch
a bunch of football players

01:37.227 --> 01:39.490
give each other
some extreme injuries.

01:39.534 --> 01:41.013
So give me back the remote.

01:41.057 --> 01:43.233
Fine, Chief. Here you go.

01:43.277 --> 01:46.323
But, it won't do you any good
without the batteries.

01:46.367 --> 01:47.324
Give me those!

01:51.372 --> 01:53.809
Fight! Fight!
Fight! Fight! Fight!

01:53.852 --> 01:56.159
Hey, hey, hey.
Stop fighting, you two.

01:56.203 --> 01:58.596
This is Thanksgiving.
Not Christmas!

01:58.640 --> 02:01.469
- Well, he started it.
- I'm sorry, Chief.

02:01.512 --> 02:04.602
Can I get you a warm bottle
or maybe some nursery rhymes?

02:04.646 --> 02:06.343
Because you're acting
like a big baby.

02:06.387 --> 02:08.171
- Am not.
- Are, too.

02:08.215 --> 02:09.607
That's enough!

02:09.651 --> 02:11.435
Now, why don't you go
help Negative Girl

02:11.479 --> 02:13.089
set the ping pong table
for dinner?

02:13.133 --> 02:15.091
- Fine.
- Okay.

02:15.135 --> 02:17.224
Wow. Looks like you
had your hands full
this Thanksgiving.

02:17.267 --> 02:19.008
I have been pretty busy.

02:19.051 --> 02:21.228
I made this centerpiece
out of locally sourced weeds.

02:21.271 --> 02:23.055
- I cleaned the bats
out of the attic.

02:23.099 --> 02:24.535
Get outta here! Shoo!

02:24.579 --> 02:26.102
And I spent all morning

02:26.146 --> 02:28.365
making this tofu turkey
just for my little baby.

02:28.409 --> 02:29.627
Aww, thanks, Moms.

02:29.671 --> 02:31.934
You really go all out.

02:31.977 --> 02:34.632
I just hope I can get
the rest of my cooking done
before the parade starts.

02:34.676 --> 02:36.373
Oh, yeah.
I can't wait to go

02:36.417 --> 02:38.636
to the Codsville
Thanksgiving parade.

02:38.680 --> 02:41.204
It's been my dream
ever since I was a young girl
to be in that parade,

02:41.248 --> 02:44.033
smiling at the crowd
and doing that slow wave.

02:44.076 --> 02:45.339
You know,
the one where it looks like

02:45.382 --> 02:47.167
you're trying to
screw in a light bulb.

02:47.210 --> 02:48.472
So do it, Moms.

02:48.516 --> 02:50.257
Oh, no, no, no, no, dear.

02:50.300 --> 02:52.259
I could never be
in that parade.

02:52.302 --> 02:53.651
Well, holds on to that dream,

02:53.695 --> 02:55.479
because someday
it might come true.

03:00.528 --> 03:02.182
Tell us, Beast Boy.

03:02.225 --> 03:03.966
What is the purpose
of this super-secret meeting?

03:04.009 --> 03:06.273
I was thinking,
since Moms does so much

03:06.316 --> 03:09.232
for us on Thanksgiving,
we should make her a surprise.

03:09.276 --> 03:11.887
- That is so nice.
- What'd you have in mind?

03:11.930 --> 03:14.846
Well, she really wants
to be part of the Thanksgiving
parade,

03:14.890 --> 03:16.674
so I thinks
we should build her a float.

03:16.718 --> 03:17.806
Great idea.

03:17.849 --> 03:19.547
Oh, yes.

03:19.590 --> 03:22.071
Oh, I am very skilled
at the art and craft times.

03:22.114 --> 03:24.465
And I love building things
because you never know

03:24.508 --> 03:26.684
when someone might get
horribly mutilated.

03:26.728 --> 03:28.904
Great. Now, let us get to work.

03:51.883 --> 03:54.016
Yo, Moms,
Chief, come outside.

03:54.059 --> 03:55.844
What is it, sweetie?

03:55.887 --> 03:58.412
We've got a big surprise
for Momsy's.

04:00.283 --> 04:03.286
Hey, this better be good.

04:03.330 --> 04:04.983
I'm missing the game.

04:05.027 --> 04:07.116
Now, you know how's you said,
you've always dreamed

04:07.159 --> 04:08.900
of being
in the Thanksgiving parade.

04:08.944 --> 04:11.599
Well, we took it upon ourselves
to build yous

04:11.642 --> 04:13.601
the greatest float
ever created.

04:13.644 --> 04:15.342
Behold!

04:34.970 --> 04:36.624
Wow.

04:36.667 --> 04:40.192
I... I can't believe you three
build me an actual float.

04:40.236 --> 04:42.630
Well,
this isn't just any float.

04:42.673 --> 04:44.371
This is a very special float.

04:44.414 --> 04:46.590
It represents
each member of our family.

04:46.634 --> 04:48.418
Look, we have
the football player

04:48.462 --> 04:52.161
to represent the Chief's love
of extreme sports injuries.

04:52.204 --> 04:53.771
Then we have
the canines to represent

04:53.815 --> 04:56.774
my love of the dog show,
which I enjoy so very much.

04:56.818 --> 05:00.648
And over here,
we have Mr. Turkey.
Gobble, gobble.

05:00.691 --> 05:04.739
And, I added this toilet
to represent my tradition
of eating so much food

05:04.782 --> 05:07.002
that I have to take
a big Thanksgiving Day poop.

05:07.045 --> 05:10.005
And because Moms
is our mama bear,

05:10.048 --> 05:11.441
we added this mama bear.

05:13.835 --> 05:15.402
So what'd you think?

05:15.445 --> 05:17.752
I think
it's the best float ever?

05:17.795 --> 05:19.231
Come here, you three.

05:22.844 --> 05:24.236
We better hurry

05:24.280 --> 05:25.803
if we're going to get
to that parade.

05:25.847 --> 05:27.979
That's what's up.

05:31.461 --> 05:33.724
- Ha-ha, we made it.

05:33.768 --> 05:35.160
And just in time too.

05:35.204 --> 05:36.727
It looks like the parade
is about to begin.

05:36.771 --> 05:38.816
This is so exciting.

05:38.860 --> 05:41.993
I can't believe
my Thanksgiving Day dream
is finally coming true.

05:44.169 --> 05:45.562
Yeah.

05:45.606 --> 05:47.912
Huh? Why isn't
this thing moving?

05:49.436 --> 05:51.220
Not so fast.

05:51.263 --> 05:52.656
What up, Brain?

05:52.700 --> 05:55.137
What do your degenerates
think you're doing?

05:55.180 --> 05:58.314
Oh, we was just about to enter
our float into the parade.

05:58.358 --> 06:02.013
Oh, so that
is what you call
this abomination.

06:02.057 --> 06:04.581
What? This is a pretty float.

06:04.625 --> 06:06.366
We worked hard
on it, you goober.

06:06.409 --> 06:08.193
Well, as ground marshal...

06:08.237 --> 06:10.413
it is my job to ensure
that this parade

06:10.457 --> 06:12.981
brings the people
of Codsville together.

06:13.024 --> 06:17.768
And I can't have you's
scaring them off
with this weird thing.

06:17.812 --> 06:19.074
Take it away.

06:19.117 --> 06:20.467
Oh, come on, bro.

06:20.510 --> 06:22.556
Don't be like that.
It's Thanksgiving.

06:22.599 --> 06:24.601
The day of generosity.

06:24.645 --> 06:26.864
Oh,
I suppose you're right.

06:26.908 --> 06:29.563
I should be generous,
which is why

06:29.606 --> 06:32.914
I shall give you five seconds
to turn this float around

06:32.957 --> 06:35.307
before I have it impounded.

06:35.351 --> 06:37.571
Okay, okay, we're going.

06:42.706 --> 06:46.014
That snob
is always ruining our fun.

06:46.057 --> 06:48.016
Well, we ain't giving up
so easily.

06:48.059 --> 06:49.409
But you heard the brain.

06:49.452 --> 06:51.062
He doesn't want us
in the parade.

06:51.106 --> 06:52.412
True. True.

06:52.455 --> 06:54.283
But, who cares
what that fool says?

06:54.326 --> 06:55.937
Yeah, forget the Brain.

06:55.980 --> 06:56.981
We're gonna be
part of this parade,

06:57.025 --> 06:58.287
whether he likes it or not.

07:00.550 --> 07:03.466
Now, let's find a way
to sneak in.

07:03.510 --> 07:04.859
Time to get...

07:06.164 --> 07:07.339
...extreme!

07:07.383 --> 07:08.384
Punch it, Chief!

07:21.136 --> 07:22.746
There's gotta be
an opening somewhere.

07:25.967 --> 07:27.359
Hurry, Chief, turn there.

07:36.412 --> 07:37.718
Yes!

07:37.761 --> 07:39.807
Number one Doom Patrol!
Doom Patrol!

07:39.850 --> 07:41.156
Hear those gasps?

07:41.199 --> 07:42.853
We've taken their breath away.

07:42.897 --> 07:45.987
Yeah, we left them
totally speechless, yo.

07:46.030 --> 07:47.771
Doom Patrol!

07:54.604 --> 07:56.171
Oh-oh, Chief.
The Brain looks mad.

07:56.214 --> 07:58.260
You better get that
insurance card ready.

07:58.303 --> 08:01.611
Don't be silly.
I don't have "insurance."

08:01.655 --> 08:05.572
I should have known
you degenerates would not
have given up so easily.

08:05.615 --> 08:08.313
But you're too late
to stop my plan.

08:08.357 --> 08:10.577
What plan?

08:10.620 --> 08:14.276
As you know,
Thanksgiving marks the start
of the holiday shopping season,

08:14.319 --> 08:16.757
and I'm tired
of dealing with the crowds.

08:16.800 --> 08:20.804
Therefore, I'm going to
imprison this entire city

08:20.848 --> 08:22.763
so that
all of the holiday deals

08:22.806 --> 08:24.547
would be mine
for the taking.

08:37.647 --> 08:40.607
The Brain
is imprisoning everyone
in cranberry sauce.

08:40.650 --> 08:42.696
And not even
a good stuff either.

08:42.739 --> 08:45.612
Canned cranberry sauce
is the worst.

08:45.655 --> 08:46.830
That's enough, Brain.

08:46.874 --> 08:48.789
Don't make us
take you down.

08:48.832 --> 08:52.706
Do you degenerates
truly think you can defeat
my mighty float?

08:53.663 --> 08:55.796
Oh, you're going down.

08:55.839 --> 08:57.841
Because we've got
a float of our own.

09:01.497 --> 09:02.672
Touch down!

09:05.370 --> 09:07.285
You shall pay for that.

09:10.941 --> 09:11.812
Go doggies! Go!

09:16.338 --> 09:18.514
Hmm, but let's see
how you deal with this?

09:25.565 --> 09:26.653
Take cover!

09:35.139 --> 09:37.533
- Turkey attack!

09:47.587 --> 09:49.850
Now... it's time to end this.

09:53.810 --> 09:54.985
Fools!

09:55.029 --> 09:57.031
You may have defeated me,

09:57.074 --> 10:00.600
but good luck
dealing with those crowds.

10:00.643 --> 10:02.689
We ain't worried about
no crowds, fool!

10:02.732 --> 10:05.909
Because we can get
those same holiday deals
by shopping online, hello.

10:05.953 --> 10:08.042
Nice work, Doom Patrol.

10:08.085 --> 10:09.826
Now, let's go
finish the parade.

10:09.870 --> 10:12.002
But how? Our float is ruined.

10:12.046 --> 10:14.352
And we worked
so hard on it too.

10:14.396 --> 10:15.440
Don't sweat it, yo.

10:15.484 --> 10:16.877
Because I gots an idea.

10:20.750 --> 10:22.578
We did it!

10:22.622 --> 10:25.102
We made Mom's
Thanksgiving dream
finally come true.

10:25.146 --> 10:29.498
This is
the best Thanksgiving ever.

10:29.541 --> 10:30.804
That's what's up!

10:33.067 --> 10:35.156
Quick, Chief, pass it to me!

10:35.199 --> 10:36.374
Over here! Over here!

10:36.418 --> 10:38.725
Pass it to me, Chief,
I'm open.

10:43.555 --> 10:45.296
Yes!

10:45.340 --> 10:46.428
- Boomsies!

10:49.997 --> 10:51.694
Nice throw,
you big goober.

10:51.738 --> 10:53.130
It's all good.
I'll gets it.

10:55.002 --> 10:56.656
Hey, what's this?

10:56.699 --> 10:57.831
Oh, nothing.

10:57.874 --> 10:59.397
Just some
old home movies

10:59.441 --> 11:01.138
from when each of you
got your superpowers.

11:01.182 --> 11:03.358
Really?
That's so cool.

11:03.401 --> 11:04.925
Let's watch 'em, yo!

11:04.968 --> 11:05.969
Oh, yeah.
- Oh, it's been so long.

11:06.013 --> 11:07.318
Can't we do something else?

11:07.362 --> 11:08.319
No!

11:14.456 --> 11:16.066
<i>Here they come
for the final lap.</i>

11:16.110 --> 11:18.765
<i>And pushing it for the win
is Cliff Steele!</i>

11:18.808 --> 11:21.202
Oh, snap! You used to be
into auto racing?

11:21.245 --> 11:22.246
That's right.

11:22.290 --> 11:23.595
Before I got my robot body,

11:23.639 --> 11:26.511
I was a super-fast
race car driver.

11:26.555 --> 11:29.950
<i>I will always remember the day
of my terrible accident.</i>

11:33.736 --> 11:34.824
<i>It was the day...</i>

11:36.130 --> 11:37.784
I won the race.

11:37.827 --> 11:39.742
And now I shall celebrate
by dancing through the night.

11:39.786 --> 11:40.743
Boomsies!

11:44.573 --> 11:47.837
Ooh, this club is having
a breakdancing competition?

11:47.881 --> 11:50.274
Oh, I would like
to win that very much.

11:50.318 --> 11:51.319
Oh, yes.

11:51.362 --> 11:52.755
Oh, no!

11:52.799 --> 11:54.757
You may be
the best race car driver boy,

11:54.801 --> 11:57.107
but I am the best
break-dancer boy.

11:57.151 --> 11:58.326
Uh, check it out, check it out.

12:00.894 --> 12:03.418
No way. I have
all the best dance moves.

12:03.461 --> 12:05.942
Look, I packed them.
It's a suitcase of dance.

12:05.986 --> 12:07.857
Whoa! What? What? Yeah!

12:07.901 --> 12:09.250
- Ooh!

12:09.293 --> 12:12.427
But can you do
The Robot?

12:24.656 --> 12:26.136
Hey! Watch it!

12:26.180 --> 12:28.312
I am sorry.
It was a terrible accident.

12:28.356 --> 12:30.227
I was trying to do the Robot,

12:30.271 --> 12:32.055
but it remains
the one dance move

12:32.099 --> 12:33.578
that has
evaded my mastery.

12:33.622 --> 12:35.276
Well, I can
fix that for you.

12:35.319 --> 12:36.799
You can?

12:36.843 --> 12:39.671
Sure. All we have to do
is get a little extreme.

12:50.813 --> 12:51.814
Congratulations.

12:51.858 --> 12:53.468
The surgery was a success.

12:53.511 --> 12:55.122
Now I can do
the robot dance?

12:55.165 --> 12:58.603
Of course!
Because now you are a robot.

12:58.647 --> 13:00.736
How is this possible?

13:00.780 --> 13:02.651
Simple. I remove your brain

13:02.694 --> 13:04.740
and put it inside
the robot body.

13:04.784 --> 13:06.437
Could you not have just
gotten me dance lessons?

13:06.481 --> 13:08.657
Sure, but this is way better.
You'll see.

13:13.967 --> 13:15.707
Cool body.
But it's going to take

13:15.751 --> 13:18.754
more than that
to defeat me, Robot boy.

13:18.798 --> 13:20.625
I am not a robot boy.

13:20.669 --> 13:22.540
I am a robot man!

13:25.326 --> 13:27.328
Beep, spin, twirl. What?

13:27.371 --> 13:28.416
Swiggle, swiggle, swiggle.

13:32.724 --> 13:34.988
Oh, yes. What? What?
What? What? What?

13:35.031 --> 13:36.206
Zoop, zoop. Zip, zip.

13:37.991 --> 13:39.557
Restart, restart.
Control, alt, delete.

13:39.601 --> 13:41.472
So authentic.

13:43.039 --> 13:45.259
- Yes! Oh, you know it!

13:45.302 --> 13:47.478
Hooray!
I win again! Yes!

13:51.004 --> 13:53.049
So what were you doing
in that nightclub, Chief?

13:53.093 --> 13:55.008
Yeah, I thought
you hated music.

13:55.051 --> 13:57.227
I can't remember.
It was years ago.

13:57.271 --> 13:59.316
Now will you please
stop putting me on trial

13:59.360 --> 14:01.057
so we can go
get something to eat?

14:01.101 --> 14:03.843
Not just yet, Chief!
I want to check out my movie.

14:07.107 --> 14:09.239
Hey! I remember this.
This is the day

14:09.283 --> 14:11.851
the Chief helped me win
my squishy-mushy face.

14:13.896 --> 14:14.810
Whoo-hoo!

14:22.905 --> 14:24.472
A hundred tickets!

14:25.865 --> 14:27.518
I'm never
gonna win that bear.

14:27.562 --> 14:29.346
Don't get down
on yourself, little lady.

14:29.390 --> 14:30.870
You can still win that bear.

14:30.913 --> 14:31.914
But how?

14:31.958 --> 14:34.090
I'm almost out of tokens.

14:34.134 --> 14:36.701
By playing this.

14:36.745 --> 14:38.312
If you can
defeat the mother ship,

14:38.355 --> 14:39.791
those tickets will be yours.

14:43.752 --> 14:45.667
<i>All systems ready.</i>

14:45.710 --> 14:46.973
<i>Warning! Warning!</i>

14:50.802 --> 14:52.456
Oh, come on! Ugh!

14:52.500 --> 14:53.544
Try it again.

14:55.372 --> 14:56.504
- Ugh!
- Try it again.

14:57.679 --> 14:59.811
- Ugh!
- Try it again.

14:59.855 --> 15:01.944
This game is too hard.

15:01.988 --> 15:03.424
No, it isn't.

15:03.467 --> 15:05.687
You just have to become
one with the game.

15:05.730 --> 15:07.167
Well, can you help me?

15:07.210 --> 15:09.299
Sure, sure.
But let me ask you something.

15:09.343 --> 15:11.954
Are you willing
to get extreme?

15:13.695 --> 15:16.219
I'll do anything
to win that bear.

15:16.263 --> 15:17.351
Great!

15:18.526 --> 15:20.267
Hey, uh, is that thing safe?

15:20.310 --> 15:21.398
Oh, definitely not.

15:27.056 --> 15:28.536
What did you do to me?

15:28.579 --> 15:30.538
I turned you into
a negatively charged being.

15:30.581 --> 15:32.714
Now you can become
one with the game

15:32.757 --> 15:35.456
and win that bear.

15:35.499 --> 15:37.501
But you could've just
shared your tickets with me.

15:38.807 --> 15:40.156
Oh, where's the fun in that?

15:40.200 --> 15:42.028
Now, go on.
Give it a try.

15:45.205 --> 15:47.685
<i>Warning. Warning.</i>

15:47.729 --> 15:49.122
You're going down.

15:51.733 --> 15:54.170
Oh, yeah?
Who's laughing now?

15:54.214 --> 15:55.432
Take that!

16:00.742 --> 16:02.874
You're right.
That was fun!

16:06.313 --> 16:07.967
Now give me that bear!

16:14.930 --> 16:17.889
And that's how I won
my favorite squishy-mushy.

16:17.933 --> 16:20.283
But isn't that bizarre
that the Chief was spending

16:20.327 --> 16:22.546
his leisure time
at an arcade?

16:22.590 --> 16:24.896
It does sound suspicious.

16:24.940 --> 16:26.681
There's nothing
suspicious about it.

16:26.724 --> 16:28.030
Now can we please go eat?

16:28.074 --> 16:29.031
I'm starving!

16:29.075 --> 16:30.206
Not so fast, Chief.

16:30.250 --> 16:31.860
I want to watch my movie.

16:34.950 --> 16:36.473
Oh, my goodness.

16:36.517 --> 16:38.084
This was when I was
trying to make it

16:38.127 --> 16:39.259
as a Hollywood actor.

16:43.132 --> 16:45.395
Look out! It's a monster!

16:47.571 --> 16:49.051
Cut!

16:49.095 --> 16:51.488
Whoa! What's the matter?
That take was perfect.

16:51.532 --> 16:53.142
But look at me.

16:53.186 --> 16:55.057
No audience is gonna
take me seriously as an actor

16:55.101 --> 16:56.493
if I'm covered in slime.

16:56.537 --> 16:57.712
I know, I know,
but don't worry.

16:57.755 --> 16:59.018
I'll make sure
it doesn't happen

16:59.061 --> 17:00.019
in the next movie.

17:10.986 --> 17:12.553
Cut! That's it!

17:12.596 --> 17:14.424
I am done acting
in these low budget movies

17:14.468 --> 17:16.252
where I end up getting slimed!

17:20.430 --> 17:22.780
All of my life,
I've dreamed of becoming

17:22.824 --> 17:25.783
the biggest Hollywood star
the world has ever seen.

17:25.827 --> 17:29.744
But now I fear
it's just never gonna happen.

17:29.787 --> 17:31.746
Well, this machine
can help you with that.

17:32.877 --> 17:33.878
It can?

17:33.922 --> 17:35.445
Of course.

17:35.489 --> 17:37.621
That is, if you're willing
to get a little extreme!

17:41.408 --> 17:43.540
I love getting extreme.

17:43.584 --> 17:45.586
Great! Then, hop inside here.

17:46.630 --> 17:48.719
What exactly is this thing?

17:48.763 --> 17:49.938
A movie prop?

17:49.981 --> 17:51.374
No, no, no, no.

17:51.418 --> 17:53.333
It's a chamber
that will modify your DNA.

17:53.376 --> 17:54.464
Wait, what?

18:06.041 --> 18:07.956
What just happened?

18:07.999 --> 18:09.653
The chamber
merged your DNA

18:09.697 --> 18:11.394
with children's
modeling clay.

18:11.438 --> 18:13.701
But all I wanted
was a new audition.

18:13.744 --> 18:15.181
I know,

18:15.224 --> 18:17.139
but now you're guaranteed
to become

18:17.183 --> 18:20.925
the biggest Hollywood star
the world has ever seen.

18:22.753 --> 18:24.625
Look out! It's a monster!

18:28.194 --> 18:31.588
I'm finally
a big Hollywood star.

18:36.115 --> 18:38.334
Wow, I can't believe
Moms was a movie star

18:38.378 --> 18:39.335
on a Hollywood set.

18:39.379 --> 18:40.771
Speaking of which,

18:40.815 --> 18:42.730
what were you doing on set
that day, Chief?

18:42.773 --> 18:44.210
Well, that's not important.

18:44.253 --> 18:45.863
Now, how about
we get ourselves some grub?

18:45.907 --> 18:47.213
Hold up, Chief!

18:47.256 --> 18:49.128
We still gots to watch
the one about me.

18:56.961 --> 18:58.572
Go away! We're eating!

18:58.615 --> 19:00.487
Don't be rude, Chief.
Answer it.

19:00.530 --> 19:02.010
All right, all right.

19:03.098 --> 19:04.360
Yeah, what do you want?

19:04.404 --> 19:05.709
Who is it, Chief?

19:05.753 --> 19:07.015
I don't know.
There's nobody here.

19:07.058 --> 19:08.756
That's odd.

19:08.799 --> 19:10.888
It's probably just a prank
from those rotten teenagers.

19:14.153 --> 19:15.458
It's not a prank.

19:15.502 --> 19:17.852
It's a cute little baby boy.

19:17.895 --> 19:19.897
Well, what's it doing
at our door?

19:19.941 --> 19:21.508
I think he needs a new family.

19:21.551 --> 19:24.380
And I think he found one.
Oh, yes, he did.

19:27.209 --> 19:29.777
You can live with us forever.

19:31.692 --> 19:34.216
Oh, somebody needs
a diaper change.

19:35.652 --> 19:37.088
Fine, I'll change him,

19:37.132 --> 19:39.134
but this better be
a one-time thing.

19:42.833 --> 19:43.834
Chief!

19:47.273 --> 19:48.230
Chief!

19:51.581 --> 19:52.582
Chief!

20:01.287 --> 20:03.027
Oh, man.

20:03.071 --> 20:04.942
It's like his poo-poos are
on an infinite repeat cycle.

20:04.986 --> 20:08.032
If only there was a way
to avoid changing him.

20:08.076 --> 20:09.556
<i>Avoid changing him.</i>

20:09.599 --> 20:12.907
Say there, little guy,
you wanna get extreme?

20:14.343 --> 20:17.259
I'll take that as a yes.
To the laboratory!

20:29.097 --> 20:30.838
Guess who just solved
our pooping problems?

20:30.881 --> 20:32.753
- Behold!
- Why is he green?

20:32.796 --> 20:34.233
Nothing to be alarmed about.

20:34.276 --> 20:35.538
I simply injected him

20:35.582 --> 20:37.236
with an experimental
monkey serum.

20:37.279 --> 20:38.759
You did what?

20:38.802 --> 20:41.152
Now he can transform
into animals

20:41.196 --> 20:43.154
and go poop outside.

20:43.198 --> 20:45.287
Once again,
you've gone to the extreme.

20:45.331 --> 20:47.724
But I guess we don't have
to change diapers anymore.

20:47.768 --> 20:50.466
And that makes everyone
a winner.

20:50.510 --> 20:51.859
Except for our neighbor.

20:54.340 --> 20:56.342
Not on my azaleas.

20:59.475 --> 21:02.043
That was so much
of a super funky
fresh fun times, right?

21:02.086 --> 21:04.654
Hold up.
Who shot these movies?

21:04.698 --> 21:07.614
- Who cares?

21:07.657 --> 21:09.746
Party, party time.
Party time. Party-- Oh.

21:11.357 --> 21:12.836
- Yo, check it.
- What is it?

21:12.880 --> 21:14.316
Oh, it's nothing.
Give me that!

21:14.360 --> 21:15.709
Let me see that folder.

21:18.668 --> 21:20.322
- What?

21:20.366 --> 21:22.672
Chief, you were planning
to transform us the whole time?

21:22.716 --> 21:24.326
And for what?

21:24.370 --> 21:27.111
So you could turn us
into a team of superheroes?

21:27.155 --> 21:30.811
No. I did it to turn you
into a family.

21:31.855 --> 21:33.248
Wow!

21:33.292 --> 21:34.641
I can't believe
you care about us so much

21:34.684 --> 21:36.512
that you'd turn us
into a family of freaks.

21:36.556 --> 21:38.253
That is so nice, Chief.

21:38.297 --> 21:39.907
It's literally
the sweetest thing

21:39.950 --> 21:41.387
anyone's ever done for me.

21:41.430 --> 21:44.346
Come over here
and give us a hug.

21:44.390 --> 21:46.305
Don't go all mushy on me.
