WEBVTT

00:56.570 --> 00:58.140
It's been a while.

01:01.120 --> 01:06.320
I heard you were living like this but...

01:08.770 --> 01:14.720
I'm working hard so Moo Yul will receive
recognition from the government.

01:16.900 --> 01:18.640
Recognition?

01:20.340 --> 01:22.820
I thought he was missing in action?

01:24.960 --> 01:27.110
You know something, don't you?

01:28.270 --> 01:31.840
Right?
Please tell me.

01:36.110 --> 01:39.540
By any chance...
have you heard anything about Jin Pyo?

01:40.710 --> 01:42.149
Jin Pyo?

01:42.150 --> 01:43.009
You didn't?

01:43.010 --> 01:44.880
I'm the one who wants to ask.

01:45.890 --> 01:47.570
Twenty-eight years ago...

01:51.530 --> 01:54.749
He disappeared after taking my baby
who was only a month old.

01:54.750 --> 01:56.700
That was the last I heard from him.

01:57.400 --> 02:00.529
Baby?
Jin Pyo did?

02:00.530 --> 02:05.830
He said Moo Yul died
and told me to start a new life.

02:07.200 --> 02:10.810
He left only a note
saying he'll raise the baby.

02:12.560 --> 02:15.910
What happened to Moo Yul?

02:17.770 --> 02:19.420
What about my child?

02:21.580 --> 02:23.529
You know something.

02:23.530 --> 02:25.689
If I knew, would I be here asking?

02:25.690 --> 02:30.930
Is there anyone
that the president can't find?

02:36.160 --> 02:37.570
I don't want anything else...

02:38.800 --> 02:40.140
My baby...

02:40.850 --> 02:44.680
My son, let me meet him once.

02:44.870 --> 02:46.980
Please find my son for me.

02:53.400 --> 02:56.970
Let me see my child...
Let me see my child just once.

03:06.210 --> 03:10.249
I clearly told you to kill him, not
hand him over to the Prosecutor's Office!

03:10.250 --> 03:13.929
I told you this is my way of taking revenge.

03:13.930 --> 03:15.962
Public opinion...?

03:15.963 --> 03:18.690
Do you seriously think the lawyers will
even prosecute him?

03:18.770 --> 03:22.129
If they were afraid of the
citizens' pointing fingers at them,

03:22.130 --> 03:24.679
they wouldn't have left
my comrades to die like that.

03:24.680 --> 03:28.560
Those guys have no conscience,
no sense of responsibility, and no loyalty!

03:30.060 --> 03:31.440
I'm sorry.

03:32.400 --> 03:37.519
A revenge that spills blood to avenge
blood spilled before... I don't want it.

03:37.520 --> 03:42.479
If you're really my son, then
you wouldn't let them have a tomorrow.

03:42.480 --> 03:44.880
If you were really my father,

03:45.250 --> 03:47.970
would you have asked me
to take on a revenge which spills blood?

03:49.670 --> 03:53.630
I want to rip them apart too
for destroying my life!

03:54.990 --> 03:59.560
If I kill them..
will their families just let me be?

04:00.110 --> 04:02.380
It will just be an endless cycle of revenge.

04:05.220 --> 04:10.500
Remove yourself from the plan.
I will take matters into my own hands.

04:10.640 --> 04:13.710
I'll do it, it's my destiny.

04:14.740 --> 04:20.660
It's just, I want to show them
that living is more painful than dying.

04:25.810 --> 04:29.700
Fine.
Let's do it that way.

04:32.350 --> 04:36.680
If you find the second target first,
I'll leave it in your hands.

04:37.970 --> 04:42.610
But if I find him first,
he'll die by my hands.

04:50.230 --> 04:52.169
Since you came all the way here...

04:52.170 --> 04:55.870
even though she abandoned you,
go meet your mother.

05:37.810 --> 05:39.310
<i>Oh, welcome.</i>

05:43.820 --> 05:45.200
Please sit.

05:45.840 --> 05:47.410
What would you like?

05:48.650 --> 05:50.880
Ramen, please.

06:11.410 --> 06:13.250
This is my favorite place.

06:14.000 --> 06:16.010
Ahjumma, I'm here.

06:16.260 --> 06:20.019
Oh, welcome.
You haven't come for a while.

06:20.020 --> 06:21.379
Sit down.
What should I get you?

06:21.380 --> 06:22.649
3 orders of extra spicy rice cake...

06:22.650 --> 06:23.919
You guys are going to eat tempura
too, right?

06:23.920 --> 06:24.689
Yeah.

06:24.690 --> 06:25.429
Not me.

06:25.430 --> 06:27.679
Did you know you have to do
tae-kwon-do kicks 256 times in order

06:27.680 --> 06:29.280
to get rid of the calories for one tempura?

06:29.281 --> 06:30.529
I'd rather not eat so I don't have to kick.

06:30.530 --> 06:32.159
Wow, that's harsh.

06:32.160 --> 06:35.520
Can you put two fritters
and two seaweed in there please?

06:35.530 --> 06:37.259
Okay give me a second,
I'll make it delicious for you.

06:37.260 --> 06:38.280
Okay.

06:38.660 --> 06:41.319
If there's problem that you can't solve,
or you bombed an exam,

06:41.320 --> 06:43.419
or if you're really stressed out,

06:43.420 --> 06:45.769
one taste of this extra spicy rice cake
will make it all go away.

06:45.770 --> 06:48.070
Do you want water?
It's self-serve.

06:50.000 --> 06:51.970
Oh, unlucky jer...

06:53.690 --> 06:55.770
Lee Yoon Sung, what are you doing here?

06:56.230 --> 06:58.729
Somebody mentioned on a blog
that the food is good here.

06:58.730 --> 07:02.510
Oh, it's so nice to see you!
Dr. Lee...

07:04.490 --> 07:07.819
I was having trouble with a math problem,

07:07.820 --> 07:10.259
so Na Na unni brought me here
to relieve my stress.

07:10.260 --> 07:12.519
She said I won't have trouble
raising my grade by 20 points

07:12.520 --> 07:14.120
if I eat spicy rice cake here.

07:14.121 --> 07:17.129
If you ate it for 365 days,
you would have been valedictorian.

07:17.130 --> 07:18.529
Lee Yoon Sung.

07:18.530 --> 07:25.270
So Doctor, stop being stubborn
and tutor me, yeah? Yeah?

07:25.380 --> 07:28.760
You seem young, but you're a doctor?

07:29.440 --> 07:32.189
Whoever your parents are,
they must be very proud of you.

07:32.190 --> 07:33.190
Enjoy your food.

07:33.420 --> 07:35.910
Ahjumma, are you not well?

07:35.911 --> 07:37.511
You don't look so well...

07:37.790 --> 07:42.440
No, it's just that I'm getting old
and I'm just tired.

07:48.080 --> 07:50.130
It's going to swell,
aren't you going to eat it?

07:53.010 --> 07:54.840
I lost my appetite.

07:59.620 --> 08:02.880
Oh... I can remake it if it's bad.

08:13.000 --> 08:14.079
Oh, my gosh.

08:14.080 --> 08:18.240
How can he just leave like that just
because I asked him to tutor me? Geez...

08:19.280 --> 08:21.060
Something's wrong.

08:52.530 --> 08:53.590
Oh, hot...

09:04.500 --> 09:07.560
<i>Designated Driver, get set, go.
Blue Moon on 3000 Dong St.</i>

09:15.970 --> 09:18.330
The alcohol I have on reserve, bring it.

09:26.740 --> 09:30.589
One of the reasons I asked to see you
is that Lee Kyung Wan is a problem,

09:30.590 --> 09:35.320
but also, bring in that guy
they call City Hunter and solve the case.

09:36.930 --> 09:41.166
The citizens will protest against it,
but it's against the law to kidnap him,

09:41.201 --> 09:43.036
stuff him into a box,
and deliver him to the Prosecutor's Office.

09:43.037 --> 09:45.651
From a legal standpoint, those are crimes
of kidnapping and false imprisonment.

09:45.730 --> 09:47.110
How can I just let him off the hook?

09:47.190 --> 09:50.679
So you want me to bring down
the City Hunter too? Is that it?

09:50.680 --> 09:53.143
Even though he appears to be on our side,
we have no choice.

09:53.144 --> 09:55.337
A criminal is still a criminal.

09:55.930 --> 09:56.870
Yes?

10:01.830 --> 10:02.760
Oh...

10:04.470 --> 10:07.180
Hey, hurry up and come.

10:09.540 --> 10:11.720
I came as soon as I saw the text.

10:11.840 --> 10:13.640
You should be faster.

10:17.540 --> 10:19.800
You... You're slacking off

10:19.819 --> 10:22.662
because I already appointed you
my designated driver, aren't you?

10:22.700 --> 10:25.030
You're drunk, let's leave.

10:26.990 --> 10:28.060
Oh!

10:38.070 --> 10:40.339
It's okay, I can pick them up.

10:40.340 --> 10:42.610
It's going to be hard
because your nails are short.

10:44.610 --> 10:46.490
Filthy...

10:48.240 --> 10:51.430
Lee Yoon Sung, let's leave together!

10:51.600 --> 10:52.439
Here you go.

10:52.440 --> 10:53.800
Thank you.

10:53.970 --> 10:55.620
Lee Yoon Sung.

10:59.090 --> 11:02.190
Prosecutor Kim, what are you doing?
My glass is empty.

11:12.990 --> 11:15.910
Do your parents know
that you're living like this in Korea?

11:15.940 --> 11:20.120
Every day you're at a club,
or with girls, or a bar.

11:20.160 --> 11:21.650
Just drive.

11:22.040 --> 11:26.070
Who did you learn to talk like that from?
Mom? Dad?

11:26.870 --> 11:27.939
I said to just drive.

11:27.940 --> 11:32.599
It's so obvious your rich parents
must have spoiled you.

11:32.600 --> 11:35.369
If you cry, they comfort you.
If you fall, they pick you up.

11:35.370 --> 11:39.429
You grew up preciously like flower plants in
a greenhouse, didn't you? It's so obvious.

11:39.430 --> 11:43.790
But, do you talk to your mom
in such a rude way, too?

11:44.780 --> 11:47.160
I don't have a mom to talk rudely to!

11:47.690 --> 11:50.300
I didn't have a mom to raise me,
that's why I'm like this, okay?!

11:56.480 --> 11:59.940
Stop the car, it feels stuffy.

12:15.520 --> 12:17.600
You should be happy...

12:22.660 --> 12:24.970
You should be living a good life...

12:30.670 --> 12:32.640
I don't like that you're suffering.

12:34.880 --> 12:36.600
I don't like that you've aged...

12:51.480 --> 12:57.080
Drink it, sometimes it's so refreshing
that you feel all your worries float away.

12:59.090 --> 13:01.580
I'm sorry about before.

13:02.120 --> 13:04.720
I was blinded by anger
at the way you were talking.

13:08.630 --> 13:13.246
At the very least, we're similar
in that we both don't have moms.

13:13.341 --> 13:15.969
It's nice that we have something in common.

13:20.270 --> 13:22.370
Why do you keep trying to build
some sort of relationship with me?

13:22.400 --> 13:25.929
Lee Yoon Sung, it's because
I felt bad about earlier,

13:25.930 --> 13:30.349
and we both understand what it's like
to not have a mom so...

13:30.350 --> 13:32.160
I don't want to understand you.

13:32.650 --> 13:34.432
You're shabby and I don't like
how you're pointlessly upbeat

13:34.433 --> 13:36.795
to an extent I just don't get.

13:38.410 --> 13:40.270
Who's a righteous prosecutor?

13:40.770 --> 13:42.009
I can't understand you and the way

13:42.010 --> 13:43.691
you just randomly attach
yourself to guys you don't even know.

13:43.892 --> 13:47.100
No, it's that I don't want to understand.

13:51.370 --> 13:53.570
Go ahead and gripe all you want,
I'll just take it.

13:54.340 --> 13:55.340
What?

13:56.430 --> 14:00.679
I grew up with my mom until I was 17,

14:00.680 --> 14:03.760
so I have a heart that's 3cm
thicker than yours.

14:04.940 --> 14:10.030
So I'll just take whatever you say even if
it bashes on every inch of my body today.

14:10.580 --> 14:16.140
I really miss my mom sometimes too...

14:17.220 --> 14:19.200
so I'll just let it go today.

14:19.250 --> 14:20.680
What about after today is over?

14:20.730 --> 14:24.110
Then you're dead!
I can take you out with half a fist.

14:31.500 --> 14:34.118
I don't like you much...

14:34.836 --> 14:38.774
But I think your smile is a little okay.

14:48.070 --> 14:50.470
I miss my mom too.

15:03.850 --> 15:08.479
The boss is back too? When? Why?
Why without telling us beforehand?

15:08.480 --> 15:12.340
Is it because...?
I was right.

15:12.490 --> 15:14.099
I noticed something was up
ever since he was so angry

15:14.100 --> 15:15.600
that you delivered that guy
to the Prosecutor's Office in a box.

15:15.601 --> 15:16.679
You pleaded with him
and said you were wrong, right?

15:16.680 --> 15:17.649
You begged him to forgive you, right?

15:17.650 --> 15:20.020
Otherwise, you and I are both dead.

15:20.340 --> 15:24.499
Oh, well...
It looks like Father and I are rivals now.

15:24.500 --> 15:29.340
What do you mean by rival?
Why do you always stand up to the boss?

15:30.050 --> 15:32.499
If you don't like my way,
then you can stay out of this.

15:32.500 --> 15:33.800
Hey, You Punk!

15:33.910 --> 15:38.070
Dad lost his comrades,
but I lost my parents.

15:39.710 --> 15:42.479
Do you think his desire for revenge
is greater than mine,

15:42.480 --> 15:44.480
the one who was abandoned by his mother?

15:44.481 --> 15:47.710
So why did you hand him over to
the prosecutor? You should have killed him.

15:49.060 --> 15:54.450
After this is done,
I want to live normally like everyone else.

15:56.190 --> 15:57.920
But if I'm a killer...

15:59.430 --> 16:03.760
after killing someone's father,
someone's husband...

16:06.480 --> 16:08.600
do you think I can live happily?

16:10.410 --> 16:11.780
You're too nice.

16:12.390 --> 16:14.960
Aigoo, you thoughtful kid.

16:15.180 --> 16:17.670
You're right, yeah you're right
so do it your way.

16:18.300 --> 16:21.380
Since the day you saved my life,
I'm forever on your side.

16:22.560 --> 16:25.080
I doubt that the boss
will go as far as to kill us, right?

16:34.270 --> 16:35.270
<i>Oh.</i>

16:40.350 --> 16:42.230
Filthy...

16:43.690 --> 16:45.220
Lee Yoon Sung.

17:03.820 --> 17:06.959
I feel like you've been following me
since yesterday.

17:06.960 --> 17:09.179
Lee Yoon Sung, you seem like you only go...

17:09.180 --> 17:11.410
to the most expensive bars
and shopping malls.

17:13.000 --> 17:15.209
I don't think you're any different,
Prosecutor Kim.

17:15.210 --> 17:18.170
I only went to the bar yesterday because
my boss said he was going to treat...

17:18.369 --> 17:20.339
and I have a present to buy today.

17:23.060 --> 17:24.133
I saw on the news

17:24.134 --> 17:28.111
that you're in charge of Assemblyman
Lee Kyung Wan or whomever's case,

17:28.160 --> 17:29.359
but it seems you have lots of free time.

17:29.360 --> 17:31.894
Like everyone else,
I work and also enjoy life.

17:31.895 --> 17:33.969
That's basically how I live.

17:45.100 --> 17:46.740
- May I take a look at that?
- May I take a look at that?

17:49.950 --> 17:53.189
Excuse me, I got it first.

17:53.190 --> 17:55.290
Shall we rewind the security tapes?

17:58.530 --> 18:03.130
Customers, we have enough in stock
for both of you.

18:03.230 --> 18:04.581
Oh, really?

18:05.479 --> 18:08.009
Then can you put
this in there for me too?

18:08.290 --> 18:09.990
Wrap this also, please.

18:23.660 --> 18:26.970
You must have bought a girl's wallet
so you can live like everyone else?

18:26.990 --> 18:28.750
Is it a present?

18:29.890 --> 18:33.059
It seems you're done with one night stands,

18:33.060 --> 18:35.690
there's no way you're buying a gift
for a girl you saw only once.

18:35.920 --> 18:37.770
I usually receive the gifts.

18:37.771 --> 18:39.371
Take care.

18:48.470 --> 18:49.500
Hello.

18:49.630 --> 18:51.929
The arrest warrant was already issued.

18:51.930 --> 18:55.671
Lee Kyung Wan himself admitted that he
embezzled from the Hunger Prevention Fund.

18:55.672 --> 18:57.491
Therefore,
he stands guilty under the current law.

18:57.492 --> 19:01.192
As for the National Assembly,
there should be no issue whatsoever.

19:01.230 --> 19:05.349
The person who delivered him to our door,
the City Hunter guy or whatever...

19:05.350 --> 19:06.690
Did you find out anything about him?

19:06.710 --> 19:10.120
We looked at the CCTV to investigate it,
but the license plate was a fake.

19:10.121 --> 19:12.089
And the faces aren't visible
because of their hats.

19:12.090 --> 19:15.799
We examined the box closely too,
but found no fingerprints.

19:15.800 --> 19:18.629
Someone can't even catch the person
who kidnapped the Assemblyman,

19:18.630 --> 19:21.599
but someone else was able to kidnap him
and even deliver him to our front door.

19:21.600 --> 19:22.848
And this person

19:22.849 --> 19:26.329
aired a clip of the Assemblyman
that couldn't be blocked or removed.

19:26.710 --> 19:28.650
Everyone else leave
except for Prosecutor Kim.

19:30.260 --> 19:33.299
I understand what you want, so I'll ask.

19:33.300 --> 19:35.950
But you still have to go
to the academy, okay?

19:36.710 --> 19:39.009
If you don't get into college again,

19:39.010 --> 19:42.100
Dad is going to be so embarrassed that he'll
be hanging his head in shame. All right?

19:42.101 --> 19:48.040
That's why you have to make him
be my tutor. Please!

19:48.530 --> 19:53.230
Okay, I understand.
So first go to the academy, okay?

19:54.390 --> 19:59.239
No, hurry and promise me first, Mom.
Then I'll go.

19:59.240 --> 20:01.910
How are we going to break
your stubbornness...?

20:05.750 --> 20:08.328
<i>We can't have a National Assembly</i>

20:08.329 --> 20:11.407
<i>that steals from the government
and starves our children!</i>

20:13.830 --> 20:16.799
In front of the National Assembly building,
protests against Assemblyman Lee Kyung Wan

20:16.800 --> 20:18.400
have been taking place
nonstop for several days.

20:18.500 --> 20:20.909
With current and former accountants
leading the way, civil groups

20:20.910 --> 20:22.110
are being formed.

20:22.111 --> 20:26.509
Their main goal is to investigate
the Social Welfare Grants.

20:26.510 --> 20:27.851
Ah, seriously...

20:27.870 --> 20:32.549
It's not like we can ask the president
for help, we're in a really tough spot.

20:32.550 --> 20:37.504
Over the last few days, large-scale protests
have been taking place around the nation.

20:37.505 --> 20:40.442
The citizens are furious.

20:40.600 --> 20:45.009
I'm telling you, If you take Lee Kyung Wan's
side, you're going to die with him.

20:45.010 --> 20:47.929
And be extra cautious since
you're about to run for election.

20:47.930 --> 20:51.869
Prosecutor Kim has sworn
to take this to the end.

20:51.870 --> 20:57.110
It's best right now to stay under the radar
of the citizens and the Prosecutor's Office.

20:57.840 --> 21:00.570
We can't do this and we can't do that, geez.

22:09.720 --> 22:11.630
My name is Kim Sang Gook.

22:12.320 --> 22:14.030
You're the one that called, correct?

22:16.660 --> 22:19.799
My name is Lee Jin Pyo.
Nice to meet you.

22:19.800 --> 22:21.089
How did you know about me?

22:21.090 --> 22:22.699
You used to be a cop.

22:22.700 --> 22:25.402
You used your position as a cop,
to access classified police documents

22:25.403 --> 22:27.473
and the National Intelligence Service (NIS)
database,

22:27.474 --> 22:28.709
that's why you were dismissed from your job.

22:28.710 --> 22:32.909
I'm not interested in people
who run secret background checks.

22:32.910 --> 22:38.460
Sergeant Kim Sang Jin...
Don't you want to know his whereabouts?

22:38.550 --> 22:41.250
That's the reason you hacked into
the police and NIS databases.

22:45.750 --> 22:47.699
Sergeant Kim was under my command.

22:47.700 --> 22:51.360
At this very location, I personally trained
him to be an anti-North special agent.

22:51.840 --> 22:54.969
And I'm the only person
who witnessed his final moments.

22:54.970 --> 22:59.039
Do you... know the truth
about my brother's death?

22:59.040 --> 23:01.673
My brother isn't missing in action.
He was actually an anti-North special agent.

23:01.674 --> 23:04.141
He must have died
under mysterious circumstances.

23:05.060 --> 23:07.290
If what I just said is wrong,
please tell me.

23:09.490 --> 23:12.470
In the waters of Nampo Port
in North Korea...

23:13.780 --> 23:19.690
He was shot to death.
Furthermore, he was shot by our own men.

23:21.300 --> 23:22.840
Shot by our own men?

23:25.770 --> 23:28.250
Your nephews' studies are going well?

23:28.251 --> 23:31.051
The eldest one should be in the middle
of his doctorate studies right now.

23:32.910 --> 23:34.750
How did you know...?

23:36.460 --> 23:41.620
That Korean-American...
charitable benefactor was you?

23:44.810 --> 23:47.700
I'm looking for someone
who shares the same goals as me.

23:50.420 --> 23:54.070
How about it?
Do you want to work with me?

23:59.320 --> 24:03.060
Pay attention to the people
around Choi Eung Chan and Lee Kyung Wan.

24:04.220 --> 24:07.160
We have to find out who the remaining
3 members of The Council of Five are.

24:07.540 --> 24:09.800
I need their blood to stain my hands.

24:09.801 --> 24:11.601
- However...
- However?

24:11.700 --> 24:14.356
However, if you reveal this secret
to anyone, don't forget you could end up

24:14.357 --> 24:17.930
like your brother and become
fish food under mysterious circumstances.

24:18.010 --> 24:23.960
Remember, out of the 21 people,
I was the only one who survived.

24:32.750 --> 24:36.610
During the Aung San incident,
he was Lee Kyung Wan's high school sunbae.

24:37.190 --> 24:40.011
He was also a sunbae for the diplomat exam,
and attended Lee's book launch,

24:40.012 --> 24:42.450
and was former ambassador to New Zealand.

24:43.280 --> 24:44.810
Moon Ki Joo.

24:44.840 --> 24:46.250
Is it him?

24:46.770 --> 24:49.479
He's a member of the same elite club
as Lee Kyung Wan.

24:49.480 --> 24:54.060
With over 30 years of history,
this secret organization...

24:54.061 --> 24:56.661
Kim Jong Shik.

25:00.500 --> 25:02.120
What are you doing
that you're not even eating?

25:02.390 --> 25:06.289
Oh, baseball. There's an interesting match,
do you like baseball?

25:06.290 --> 25:07.860
I like it.

25:08.090 --> 25:10.240
I guess there's another baseball fan here.

25:10.400 --> 25:14.439
Lee Yoon Sung, the president is calling
for us, let's hurry up and go see him.

25:14.440 --> 25:15.530
Is he?

25:15.610 --> 25:18.150
I heard the IP address that was used
for Assemblyman Lee Kyung Wan's clip

25:18.151 --> 25:20.151
was traced back to the Blue House.

25:20.160 --> 25:22.100
Can you please investigate that?

25:22.490 --> 25:26.590
It's a matter of Blue House's security,
so you have to keep it a secret.

25:26.960 --> 25:31.159
And please have Chief Sung Young Tak
report back to me personally.

25:31.160 --> 25:32.600
Yes, Sir.

25:32.610 --> 25:34.960
That's a piece of cake!

25:35.160 --> 25:37.540
Mr. President, just leave it to us.

25:38.830 --> 25:43.009
If it's that easy, then shouldn't you have
established security measures in advance?

25:43.010 --> 25:46.449
Being unable to block the hack,
means there's a hole in our system.

25:46.450 --> 25:49.860
Find that out and take care of it.

26:08.710 --> 26:13.420
Seriously... I didn't know Lee Kyung Wan
would embezzle public funds like that.

26:13.421 --> 26:15.049
I never would have guessed.

26:15.140 --> 26:17.529
They say that no matter
how well you know someone,

26:17.530 --> 26:18.969
you can never really know
what they're like on the inside.

26:18.970 --> 26:24.190
Just several days ago, he sat right there
and declared he was completely innocent.

26:26.070 --> 26:31.130
I heard mention of some army dog tags...

26:32.450 --> 26:34.710
Is it related to what happened in the past?

26:34.790 --> 26:37.720
28 years ago, Operation Clean Sweep...

26:38.530 --> 26:40.850
It hasn't been confirmed yet,
so I'm not sure.

26:40.980 --> 26:45.550
Because I'm going to run for presidency
next term,

26:45.800 --> 26:48.148
I'm just worried someone out there

26:48.149 --> 26:51.797
has a grudge against me
because of what happened back then.

26:51.800 --> 26:53.610
I understand.

26:53.890 --> 26:57.969
I'll talk with the security team
and make sure you have added protection.

26:57.970 --> 27:02.629
If you do, I'll be very grateful
and ask for nothing more.

27:02.630 --> 27:05.280
You're not receiving preferential treatment.

27:05.310 --> 27:10.701
It's just a precaution since there's been
a terrorist attack on one of our candidates.

27:16.370 --> 27:18.890
C... Chief,
I'm going to take a personal leave.

27:19.280 --> 27:20.770
Where are you going?

27:20.860 --> 27:23.059
I'm sorry, just mark me down for a sick day.

27:23.060 --> 27:25.400
We're about to train with
the National Communications Network Team.

27:25.780 --> 27:27.039
What kind of letter was it
that she's in such a hurry?

27:27.040 --> 27:29.460
The front said "Court Auction."

27:34.960 --> 27:36.320
Yeah, Ahjussi.

27:36.390 --> 27:39.089
He's a former ambassador to New Zealand,
Moon Ki Joo.

27:39.090 --> 27:41.640
He's Lee Kyung Wan's sunbae
from high school and the diplomatic exam.

27:41.930 --> 27:43.490
Look into him.

27:45.310 --> 27:47.329
There's going to be no end at this rate.

27:47.330 --> 27:48.869
It's not like
we can go ask them individually.

27:48.870 --> 27:51.430
During the time you're whining,
go investigate it more.

27:51.810 --> 27:55.110
By the way,
what's your relationship to Na Na?

27:55.470 --> 27:57.400
Did you know that her house
is being auctioned off?

27:59.430 --> 28:03.239
Oh... oh, my gosh.
Is she going to end up on the streets?

28:03.240 --> 28:04.439
No way...

28:04.440 --> 28:06.129
<i>You said she has no money,</i>

28:06.130 --> 28:08.669
you said she has several part-time jobs
to pay for her dad's hospital bills.

28:08.670 --> 28:11.180
If you're so worried,
why don't you buy her a house?

28:11.370 --> 28:15.560
I just thought you should know,
that's why I told you.

28:16.090 --> 28:17.940
I'm busy, hanging up...

28:24.050 --> 28:27.369
Even so,
there's nothing we can do about it.

28:27.370 --> 28:29.629
I just got the eviction notice.

28:29.630 --> 28:32.829
I have personal reasons for being unable
to move out of the house right now.

28:32.830 --> 28:37.029
If the owner applies for an eviction notice,
there's nothing we can do.

28:37.030 --> 28:38.079
You have to move out.

28:38.080 --> 28:41.979
Then I'm going to go personally ask
the owner...

28:41.980 --> 28:43.790
so can you give me
their contact information?

28:46.230 --> 28:47.490
<i>Make me coffee.</i>

28:55.080 --> 28:56.940
<i>I'm very busy right now.</i>

29:01.340 --> 29:02.920
Thank you.

29:19.900 --> 29:23.220
For over 30 years
he's been friends with Lee Kyung Wan...

29:24.660 --> 29:27.550
and he was in the government
28 years ago too.

29:29.620 --> 29:33.002
The Council of Five
are definitely amongst the people here.

29:33.003 --> 29:34.585
Who is it?

29:37.386 --> 29:38.586
[Shik Joong ahjussi]

29:39.780 --> 29:40.719
What's going on, Ahjussi?

29:40.720 --> 29:42.339
You went to the courthouse a long time ago,
why aren't you back, yet?

29:42.340 --> 29:43.719
Sir, our order.

29:43.720 --> 29:45.670
Yeah, yeah I'm coming.

29:46.020 --> 29:47.269
Please try to understand my situation.

29:47.270 --> 29:49.709
If I leave that house
I have no place to live.

29:49.710 --> 29:51.969
Just let me live there a few more days,
please?

29:51.970 --> 29:54.690
How many times
do I have to tell you that you can't?!

29:55.490 --> 29:58.317
I'm not running a charity or something,
and I'm not crazy.

29:58.352 --> 29:59.449
I didn't go to auction for nothing!

29:59.450 --> 30:01.250
It's no use clinging on to me.
Hurry and leave!

30:01.290 --> 30:02.650
Owner.

30:02.770 --> 30:03.999
- Geez, why do you keep...?
- Order please.

30:04.000 --> 30:05.399
Yes, yes I'm coming.

30:05.400 --> 30:08.569
If you keep doing this it's going to disturb
my work. Hurry and leave.

30:08.570 --> 30:12.030
Hurry, hurry, hurry up and leave.
Leave already!

30:12.600 --> 30:14.389
You've done enough so leave.

30:14.390 --> 30:16.959
If you come back again,
I'm going to call the police. Got it?

30:16.960 --> 30:18.789
Please think about it one more time.

30:18.790 --> 30:20.490
I said no!

30:42.479 --> 30:43.679
[Jerk]

30:50.080 --> 30:50.919
Hello?

30:50.920 --> 30:52.169
Where are you right now?

30:52.170 --> 30:52.959
Why?

30:52.960 --> 30:55.130
Designated Driver, come right now.

30:55.250 --> 30:56.690
Right now?

30:57.820 --> 31:02.459
Something came up today,
can you call a different driver today?

31:02.460 --> 31:04.039
It's something really important.

31:04.040 --> 31:07.060
If you come within 30 minutes,
I'll cancel all your debt.

31:07.200 --> 31:09.489
What did you say?
Are you joking right now?

31:09.490 --> 31:11.750
If you don't believe me,
then record this call.

31:12.110 --> 31:14.170
Come right now to the water fountain park.

31:38.120 --> 31:39.330
Give me the key.

31:39.880 --> 31:40.870
Here.

31:46.270 --> 31:48.369
You didn't even drink,
why did you call for a driver?

31:48.370 --> 31:49.639
I'm going to start drinking now.

31:49.640 --> 31:51.040
What did you say?

31:53.150 --> 31:56.180
I was stupid for coming,
thinking you'd cancel my debt.

31:57.460 --> 32:00.729
Lee Yoon Sung, you're not even
a bit curious where I was...

32:00.730 --> 32:02.889
or what I was doing, right?

32:02.890 --> 32:04.420
Isn't that a given?

32:05.400 --> 32:07.015
You're the one who said you'll work
as my driver to pay off your debt

32:07.016 --> 32:08.369
even if it kills you.

32:08.970 --> 32:13.550
I said I'll cancel your debt,
shouldn't you be thankful?

32:16.980 --> 32:18.300
You know...

32:20.100 --> 32:24.750
Even though you're rude and act mean,
I never thought of you as a jerk...

32:25.750 --> 32:28.020
Or, I did think that before...

32:28.670 --> 32:34.580
But I never thought of you
as a malicious person.

32:34.700 --> 32:38.290
I just thought you were a little awkward
at expressing your feelings.

32:38.291 --> 32:40.440
That's what I believed.

32:41.320 --> 32:43.200
But I was wrong.

32:44.190 --> 32:45.882
Lee Yoon Sung,

32:46.785 --> 32:49.343
my first impression of you

32:49.378 --> 32:50.862
was right.

36:49.460 --> 36:52.820
Mom, are you well?

36:53.970 --> 36:55.460
Today,

36:56.360 --> 37:02.340
the guy who bought our house said
that if he rebuilds our place...

37:03.360 --> 37:08.650
and the price goes up, then great,
and if it doesn't, then oh well.

37:09.440 --> 37:12.140
Because he invested with his extra money.

37:15.920 --> 37:18.890
If I leave this house,
I have no place to go.

37:20.560 --> 37:23.400
I have to protect this house so that Dad
has a place to come back to...

37:23.450 --> 37:26.060
when he wakes up, right?

37:27.790 --> 37:31.710
For some people, it's just an investment,
for others, it's a matter of survival.

37:33.610 --> 37:38.360
Earlier, I was in a horrible mood...

37:39.530 --> 37:42.880
but he said he'd cancel all my debts
if I went.

37:43.250 --> 37:47.820
So, I ran after getting off the bus.

37:49.320 --> 37:55.230
In case Lee Yoon Sung changed his mind,
I ran with everything I had.

38:00.860 --> 38:05.680
So stupid Kim Na Na...
So pathetic Kim Na Na...

38:09.030 --> 38:12.320
Mom, but...

38:18.070 --> 38:19.970
I'm so tired.

38:23.910 --> 38:25.720
Without you mom...

38:28.800 --> 38:33.339
by myself... trying to survive...

38:33.480 --> 38:36.183
I'm so scared and tired...

38:42.170 --> 38:43.440
Mom...

39:18.820 --> 39:23.200
Yeah, Ahjussi. I'm on my way home,
I'll talk to you there.

39:40.990 --> 39:44.089
You spayed my Sam Soon
without my permission.

39:44.090 --> 39:46.059
You made it so she'll never have any babies.
She needs to be able to have babies!

39:46.060 --> 39:49.589
The surgery was done
with the dog owner's consent.

39:49.590 --> 39:53.050
The owner of the dog is me, Woman!

39:54.010 --> 39:55.309
Did you just hit me?

39:55.310 --> 39:58.270
Yeah, I hit you.
Why? Why?

40:01.010 --> 40:05.120
I heard Sam Soon ran away
from your house last year.

40:05.230 --> 40:06.769
Do you know why she left?

40:06.770 --> 40:08.909
She was in heat,
but was unable to resolve it.

40:08.910 --> 40:10.509
How do you expect a dog to live like that?

40:10.510 --> 40:12.319
If you want a dog
with reproductive capabilities,

40:12.320 --> 40:14.224
then you need to properly care
for her needs.

40:14.225 --> 40:17.069
Otherwise, just allow her to be spayed
in order to alleviate those needs.

40:17.070 --> 40:18.659
I don't know, I don't know.

40:18.660 --> 40:20.449
Screw all your difficult words

40:20.450 --> 40:24.720
and either make her the way she was before
or pay for the damages for spaying her.

40:25.170 --> 40:26.895
You can't?
Fine.

40:27.030 --> 40:28.209
I'm not leaving.

40:28.210 --> 40:30.239
Cut me, cut me, cut me, cut me, cut me.

40:30.240 --> 40:32.740
The owner and the dog are both...

40:33.440 --> 40:34.390
What?

40:34.900 --> 40:36.129
The owner and the dog?

40:36.130 --> 40:40.049
According to your wife, you left the house
and had surgery before coming back.

40:40.050 --> 40:41.637
Just like Sam Soon did...

40:41.638 --> 40:44.019
She complained that she was going crazy
and asked me to do the procedure.

40:44.090 --> 40:47.439
Do you want to get hit again...?
Ow!

40:47.440 --> 40:48.549
Yeah, 911?

40:48.550 --> 40:52.830
I'm at the vet and there's a guy who's
making a ruckus, please send someone over.

40:53.310 --> 40:57.379
The address is Seoul Dongbok Joo Street
22-8, Animal Hospital.

40:57.380 --> 40:59.550
Who are you calling right now?

41:00.180 --> 41:02.219
Let's go to the police station to figure out
who is right and who is wrong.

41:02.220 --> 41:04.770
Arm, arm, arm arm, arm...

41:06.610 --> 41:08.909
Wait, hold on.
Hold on, Ahjussi. Hold on.

41:08.910 --> 41:11.520
I'm really...
Hold on, I'm not...

41:24.260 --> 41:26.019
Thank you for helping.

41:26.020 --> 41:27.700
I wasn't helping.

41:28.490 --> 41:31.650
The cars were jammed up,
that's why I stepped in.

41:34.320 --> 41:35.810
I'm Jin Sae Hee.

41:36.420 --> 41:37.870
I'm Lee Yoon Sung.

41:43.990 --> 41:46.270
Agent Kim and Agent Shin.

41:46.670 --> 41:48.329
- Yes.
- Yes.

41:48.330 --> 41:50.683
Starting today,
in addition to guarding Choi Da Hye,

41:50.684 --> 41:52.935
you'll also be guarding
an important political figure.

41:52.970 --> 41:54.939
Political figure?
Who?

41:54.940 --> 41:57.085
A frontrunner
in the election campaign this term

41:57.386 --> 41:59.599
and former Minister of National Defense,
Seo Yong Hak.

42:00.170 --> 42:00.879
Oh.

42:00.880 --> 42:04.910
There have been a lot of unpleasant events
lately so security has been tightened up.

42:05.070 --> 42:08.364
There was a case of a terrorist attack
on a candidate before,

42:08.565 --> 42:10.601
so be extra cautious while you're on duty.

42:10.740 --> 42:14.449
This is a good chance to gain experience
protecting an important person, so do well.

42:14.450 --> 42:15.740
- Yes.
- Yes.

42:17.380 --> 42:21.369
If I'm lucky
and become the next president...

42:21.370 --> 42:24.809
then you will become special security agents
to the president.

42:24.810 --> 42:29.674
So, let's work hard to build
good relationships.

42:29.675 --> 42:30.875
I look forward to it.

42:31.090 --> 42:33.380
- We look forward to it too.
- We look forward to it too.

42:34.270 --> 42:35.660
Yes, yes.

42:39.400 --> 42:41.540
Oh, hold on.

42:41.770 --> 42:42.700
Yes?

42:44.070 --> 42:45.619
- Sir.
- Yes?

42:45.620 --> 42:47.619
There are many reporters eager
to interview you.

42:47.620 --> 42:51.269
I fear they'll ask a lot of questions about
Lee Kyung Wan.

42:51.270 --> 42:54.289
Get the list of questions to be asked
by the reporters ahead of time...

42:54.290 --> 42:57.059
and get rid of anything related to Lee.

42:57.060 --> 42:58.010
Yes.

42:59.380 --> 43:01.210
Come over and sit down.

43:01.600 --> 43:02.600
Yes.

43:07.290 --> 43:09.570
You're Kim Na Na?

43:09.810 --> 43:10.699
Yes.

43:10.700 --> 43:15.210
I hope I'm not being impolite by asking
you a favor when we've only just met,

43:15.211 --> 43:17.368
but can you pick a song for me

43:17.369 --> 43:22.012
that a woman born in the 1950's
would consider mood music?

43:23.740 --> 43:25.939
Oh, don't take it the wrong way.

43:25.940 --> 43:28.879
It's my wedding anniversary
in a couple of days

43:28.880 --> 43:33.060
and I wanted to host an event
at a western restaurant to surprise her.

43:33.310 --> 43:36.190
I need background music
to be played during that time.

43:37.350 --> 43:42.189
I've always worked for the military
so I don't know anything about that sort.

43:42.190 --> 43:44.889
My wife seems to be a little upset
these days

43:44.890 --> 43:47.879
and she even shed tears
at an interview a couple of days ago.

43:47.880 --> 43:52.279
I only have bodyguards and secretaries
who are all guys around me,

43:52.280 --> 43:55.889
so I was thinking that someone
who is a also female would be able

43:55.890 --> 43:57.490
to pick a good song,

43:57.491 --> 43:59.700
so I'm asking you this favor.

44:00.290 --> 44:02.649
I'll try my best to find a suitable song.

44:02.650 --> 44:04.030
Thank you.

44:06.530 --> 44:10.160
He's responsible for heavy artillery
transactions with the U.S.

44:10.720 --> 44:11.533
He is acknowledged

44:11.534 --> 44:15.358
for making huge contributions in building up
our country's national defense.

44:15.670 --> 44:17.849
If he were to run as a candidate
for next year's presidency,

44:17.850 --> 44:19.800
it seems he would have
a good chance of winning.

44:20.660 --> 44:23.179
Seo Yong Hak is going to run for presidency?

44:23.180 --> 44:28.740
He has the title of our nation's war hero,
so it's quite possible.

44:29.020 --> 44:34.899
In 1983, he was deeply involved
in anti-North special ops missions,

44:34.900 --> 44:37.850
so it's highly likely he participated in
Operation Clean Sweep.

44:38.720 --> 44:40.619
He's also Lee Kyung Wan's oldest friend,

44:40.620 --> 44:44.769
so it's very likely
he was one of the Council of Five.

45:06.409 --> 45:08.009
That's Na Na...

45:11.410 --> 45:13.679
What?
Na Na is Seo Yong Hak's bodyguard?

45:13.680 --> 45:14.910
You didn't know?

45:15.190 --> 45:17.140
She started today.

45:23.520 --> 45:26.989
Something happened between you
and Na Na, right? Tell me the truth.

45:26.990 --> 45:28.990
When I called earlier,
you acted really strange.

45:29.520 --> 45:32.220
Forget it, this isn't the time
to talk about that.

45:32.890 --> 45:36.470
If Father finds him first,
something irreparable will happen.

45:37.230 --> 45:38.299
That's right...

45:38.300 --> 45:41.370
I think Seo Yong Hak
is the likeliest candidate.

45:44.800 --> 45:47.489
I feel like it's him too,
but there's no evidence.

45:47.490 --> 45:51.550
Nothing was recorded about that event
and no one knows about it.

45:52.240 --> 45:53.840
There is someone who knows.

45:54.210 --> 45:55.260
Who?

45:55.670 --> 45:56.739
Lee Kyung Wan.

45:56.740 --> 45:57.790
What?

45:58.080 --> 45:59.569
I have to go see Lee Kyung Wan.

45:59.570 --> 46:00.669
You're going to pay him a visit in prison?

46:00.670 --> 46:01.789
If it's necessary...

46:01.790 --> 46:03.769
He knows your face.

46:03.770 --> 46:07.878
That's right, he recognizes me,
but he doesn't know your face.

46:07.879 --> 46:09.079
Hey!

46:09.980 --> 46:13.129
Even though I look big on the outside,
my guts are very small.

46:13.130 --> 46:15.469
Yoon Sung, you know that.
Don't do this to me.

46:15.470 --> 46:16.960
Don't worry.

46:17.340 --> 46:22.510
I'll wait outside and you just do what
I tell you and ask some leading questions.

46:24.120 --> 46:26.370
You have to be good to Na Na then.

46:29.550 --> 46:32.919
Oh, the computer won't turn on.

46:32.920 --> 46:35.390
What's wrong with it?
Does it have a virus?

46:35.440 --> 46:37.440
There's a computer doctor here,
isn't there?

46:38.010 --> 46:38.809
Who?

46:38.810 --> 46:40.230
Go Ki Joon.

46:43.800 --> 46:46.839
This is Shin Eun Ah
from the security office.

46:46.840 --> 46:49.250
Can you help us?

46:50.230 --> 46:52.769
Kim Na Na's computer broke down.

46:52.770 --> 46:55.690
I have something urgent to do,
can I use it for a second?

46:56.520 --> 46:59.830
It would be great if you can come right now.

47:00.620 --> 47:01.860
Okay.

47:05.080 --> 47:07.920
Does that girl think this place
is a computer repair center?

47:08.600 --> 47:10.067
I'm in the middle of testing
the security firewalls,

47:10.068 --> 47:12.093
so I can't leave my seat right now.

47:15.180 --> 47:17.770
I'm not someone who fixes computers.

47:18.770 --> 47:21.240
Agent Kim Na Na's computer broke down.

47:22.230 --> 47:26.370
Since she's your partner in training,
can't you go help her?

47:27.360 --> 47:29.750
Who knows,
maybe she'll flip you more gently next time.

47:35.540 --> 47:37.060
I'll go then.

47:49.810 --> 47:51.840
I heard your computer broke down.

47:52.230 --> 47:54.249
What an impressive security office...

47:54.250 --> 47:56.860
An MIT PhD
even comes to fix your computers.

47:57.100 --> 47:58.690
It's that computer.

48:11.641 --> 48:13.291
[ I'm a bullet shield. ]

48:13.310 --> 48:15.139
You've been searching for songs
this whole time,

48:15.140 --> 48:16.669
what song are you looking for?

48:16.670 --> 48:18.779
It's Seo Yong Hak's
wedding anniversary today

48:18.780 --> 48:21.649
and it's the music that will be played at
the restaurant he's having dinner at.

48:21.650 --> 48:23.190
Which restaurant?

48:23.200 --> 48:26.319
Cherbourg? I heard it's the place
where he proposed to his wife.

48:26.320 --> 48:28.509
I heard their steak is a work of art.

48:28.510 --> 48:30.329
Then do we get to eat steak there
while guarding them?

48:30.330 --> 48:32.780
How can we eat while on duty?

48:34.220 --> 48:35.730
How is this song?

48:39.380 --> 48:40.859
It's perfect for a wedding anniversary.

48:40.860 --> 48:43.370
Yeah?
Then I'm going to use this.

48:43.470 --> 48:47.190
You should run scheduled virus checks
and update your software regularly.

48:47.260 --> 48:49.113
This Trojan horse virus
may seem like nothing,

48:49.114 --> 48:51.027
but it can completely shut down
your computer.

48:51.080 --> 48:52.309
I fixed it.

48:52.310 --> 48:53.840
Thank you.

48:54.070 --> 48:55.229
I fixed it.

48:55.230 --> 48:57.000
I said thank you.

48:59.901 --> 49:01.101
So unlucky...

49:03.720 --> 49:06.779
Agent Kim, there's a package for you.

49:06.780 --> 49:08.520
- Thank you.
- Sure.

49:09.230 --> 49:12.000
Oh, it's Long Leg Ahjussi.

49:12.040 --> 49:14.709
Long Leg Ahjussi?
Did you order something online?

49:14.710 --> 49:17.080
No, there's someone like that.

49:19.260 --> 49:21.400
Oh, it's pretty.

49:21.710 --> 49:23.100
It's pretty, right?

49:24.510 --> 49:27.080
How did he know I'm here?

49:28.580 --> 49:32.470
Oh, so cute!
Isn't he nice?

49:40.500 --> 49:43.660
<i>Make me coffee. I fixed your computer,
do something in return.</i>

49:44.980 --> 49:46.880
I'll be right back.

49:57.560 --> 49:59.169
Since I fixed your computer,

49:59.170 --> 50:02.930
shouldn't you bring me coffee
as a thank you before I have to ask?

50:05.660 --> 50:07.839
If I get you coffee
just for fixing my computer,

50:07.940 --> 50:09.340
people will assume things about us.

50:09.341 --> 50:12.700
I don't like getting
unnecessarily involved with you.

50:13.140 --> 50:15.100
And you say the way I talk is rude?

50:15.170 --> 50:16.419
The way you talk cuts close too.

50:16.420 --> 50:18.810
It's easy to pick up bad habits, isn't it?

50:19.220 --> 50:20.219
I can leave, right?

50:20.220 --> 50:21.720
Wait, wait a minute.

50:24.190 --> 50:27.119
I have to stamp for you,
there are two stamps I owe you.

50:27.120 --> 50:28.500
Did you forget?

50:28.680 --> 50:32.420
You said that day if I came
within 30 minutes you'd erase all my debt.

50:33.690 --> 50:35.560
Give me back the stamp.

50:47.320 --> 50:48.910
Oh, that wallet...

50:50.630 --> 50:54.880
Why? Are you surprised
I don't have a dirty and filthy wallet?

50:55.080 --> 50:56.369
I got it as a gift.

50:56.370 --> 50:58.500
From who?

50:59.610 --> 51:01.740
He's called "Long Leg Ahjussi."

51:02.260 --> 51:03.589
Long Leg Ahjussi?

51:03.590 --> 51:08.390
The person I like the most in the world,
after my dad.

51:14.030 --> 51:15.829
Did I buy it for her
because I wanted to?

51:15.830 --> 51:17.549
I bought it because
she looked like a beggar with the other one.

51:17.550 --> 51:20.410
And it was so embarrassing,
so I had no choice but to buy it for her.

51:21.500 --> 51:25.600
What?
The person you like the most in the world?

51:26.201 --> 51:27.627
Seriously...

51:30.200 --> 51:33.540
Yeah. Yes, yes.
I understand.

51:35.010 --> 51:36.340
Bae Shik Joong.

51:36.940 --> 51:37.940
Yes.

51:39.830 --> 51:41.819
The person you requested to visit,
Lee Kyung Wan,

51:41.820 --> 51:43.404
is being transported
to the Prosecutor's Office

51:43.405 --> 51:46.109
at 1 pm for investigation,
so you can't visit him right now.

51:46.110 --> 51:49.929
Oh, so I can't see him?

51:49.930 --> 51:50.890
No.

51:53.970 --> 51:55.090
I'll give this to you then.

51:55.300 --> 51:56.240
Yes.

51:56.560 --> 51:57.820
Bye.

52:15.910 --> 52:20.430
Yeah, Ahjussi.
He's being transported right now?

53:01.390 --> 53:04.200
What do you think the country
will do for you after you die?

53:17.060 --> 53:19.970
Hey, hey.

53:20.600 --> 53:23.019
Hey, what are you doing right now?

53:23.020 --> 53:24.670
Who are you?!

55:54.600 --> 55:58.469
Hey...
What are you going to do to me?

55:58.470 --> 56:00.180
Do you know who I am?

56:03.270 --> 56:06.070
What are you going to do?

56:06.700 --> 56:09.109
Over that little hunger fund...

56:09.110 --> 56:11.730
You're going to kill me?

56:14.160 --> 56:17.680
The peace that comes after death,
is more of a luxury than you deserve.

56:18.681 --> 56:20.196
Twenty-eight years ago,

56:20.197 --> 56:25.137
the horrible death that my comrades faced
in that dark and frigid water,

56:26.390 --> 56:28.419
now it's your turn to get a taste of that.

56:28.420 --> 56:33.740
Twenty-eight years...
T... T...

56:33.760 --> 56:37.400
You didn't really forget about that,
did you?

56:40.000 --> 56:42.679
Did you think that if you destroyed
all the records of the mission,

56:42.680 --> 56:45.329
classified the anti-North special agents
as MIA

56:45.330 --> 56:48.082
and wiped all information
linked to their ID numbers,

56:48.083 --> 56:50.981
that everything
would be covered up and forgotten?

56:51.530 --> 56:53.700
20 young soldiers
from the Republic of S. Korea,

56:53.701 --> 56:55.670
shot to death by their own soldiers...

56:55.671 --> 56:57.500
in front of my eyes.

56:58.830 --> 57:04.570
The revenge I waited 28 years for...
I'm planning to start it right now.

57:07.170 --> 57:10.880
Tell me, who were The Council of Five?

57:21.420 --> 57:24.800
Their lives depend on what you say.

57:24.810 --> 57:28.750
You should already know the humiliation
they're suffering because of you.

57:29.810 --> 57:32.370
Do you want your entire family to be killed?

57:36.440 --> 57:39.240
Hey look here, please.

57:39.660 --> 57:43.700
Please not the family,
please don't touch the family.

57:43.890 --> 57:45.030
Please.

57:45.780 --> 57:49.330
Then tell me, who are The Council of Five?

57:53.350 --> 57:55.180
Should I say it?

57:57.090 --> 57:58.520
Seo Yong Hak.

58:00.530 --> 58:02.240
H... How?

58:04.370 --> 58:05.940
Who else is there?

58:39.190 --> 58:41.390
<i>The call cannot be connected...</i>

58:41.700 --> 58:44.059
We have to stop Dad.
He's going to kill them all.

58:44.060 --> 58:46.569
We shouldn't have stood up to the boss
whether or not those rotten bastards die.

58:46.570 --> 58:49.370
I think we're going
to have to put a tracking device on Father.

58:49.720 --> 58:52.519
Hey!
What are you doing?!

58:52.520 --> 58:53.529
Do you not know the boss?

58:53.530 --> 58:56.620
We're really going to die at this rate,
without anyone knowing.

58:56.980 --> 58:59.149
It's not too late, let's go to the boss now
and beg for forgiveness.

58:59.150 --> 59:00.550
Ahjussi!

59:01.450 --> 59:06.210
Aigoo, Huay Ni...
I'm going to die.

59:14.610 --> 59:16.410
This is what we'll do.

59:16.510 --> 59:20.879
If I make this hand gesture,
then turn on the music that's been prepared.

59:20.880 --> 59:21.859
Yes.

59:21.860 --> 59:23.939
And if I make the hand gesture again,

59:23.940 --> 59:28.619
bring in the cake, wine, and the flower,
without any error to the table.

59:28.620 --> 59:29.529
I understand.

59:29.530 --> 59:31.090
Thank you.

59:55.650 --> 59:57.590
It's a song I specially prepared for you,
Honey.

59:58.270 --> 59:59.670
Thank you.

01:00:27.030 --> 01:00:32.980
Youngest Son, do your best
and think carefully about your future.

01:00:34.781 --> 01:00:36.341
[Yoon Sung]

01:00:41.260 --> 01:00:43.419
You were bold in following me.

01:00:43.420 --> 01:00:47.300
<i>Father, please stop.
I'll handle it.</i>

01:00:47.540 --> 01:00:49.929
I specifically told you...

01:00:49.930 --> 01:00:53.760
Whoever finds the target first
will get to do it his way.

01:00:56.760 --> 01:00:59.840
<i>The song suits the wedding anniversary well.</i>

01:01:01.930 --> 01:01:03.420
How is this song?

01:01:04.350 --> 01:01:05.939
It's perfect for a wedding anniversary.

01:01:05.940 --> 01:01:07.610
Then I'm going to use this.

01:01:10.440 --> 01:01:11.890
K... Kim Na Na.

01:01:17.741 --> 01:01:19.491
[Jerk]

01:01:29.880 --> 01:01:31.280
<i>Cherbourg?</i>

01:01:31.600 --> 01:01:33.820
I heard it's the place
where he proposed to his wife.

01:01:34.521 --> 01:01:36.521
[Search: Cherbourg]

01:01:48.410 --> 01:01:51.939
Now, to the happiness of our family...

01:01:51.940 --> 01:01:53.710
Cheers!

01:03:14.160 --> 01:03:17.329
What...?
Is it a power outage?

01:03:17.330 --> 01:03:20.069
Sir, don't move and get under the table.

01:03:20.070 --> 01:03:23.390
Family Members, please don't panic
and get under the table.

01:03:23.570 --> 01:03:24.909
You can't see, right?

01:03:24.910 --> 01:03:26.900
All right, this way.
