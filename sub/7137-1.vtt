01:47.100 --> 01:49.600
- Oz, the name on the street

01:49.667 --> 01:51.934
for the Oswald State
Correctional Facility,

01:52.000 --> 01:54.000
Level Four.

01:54.066 --> 01:58.100
Oz is filled with murderers,
rapists, racists, drug dealers,

01:58.166 --> 01:59.934
with the most common
of criminals.

02:00.000 --> 02:02.300
But what is it
that makes a man common?

02:02.367 --> 02:04.834
Better yet,
what makes him unique?

02:04.900 --> 02:07.633
Winning wars?
Winning awards?

02:07.700 --> 02:08.800
No.

02:08.867 --> 02:11.734
What lifts a man
out of the ordinary

02:11.800 --> 02:15.000
is who he loves...

02:15.066 --> 02:16.233
and who loves him.

02:51.667 --> 02:53.133
- Today,
this great state of ours

02:53.200 --> 02:55.367
can once again stand proud.

02:55.433 --> 02:56.600
We have the finest,

02:56.667 --> 02:59.033
most modern
correctional facilities

02:59.100 --> 03:01.233
anywhere in the country.

03:01.300 --> 03:04.767
Let the word go forth
to friend and foe alike

03:04.834 --> 03:08.700
that we will spare no expense,
no time, no effort,

03:08.767 --> 03:11.934
in housing
and punishing

03:12.000 --> 03:14.700
the bottom-feeders
of our society.

03:22.567 --> 03:25.567
- Okay, could I have
your attention, please?

03:25.633 --> 03:28.533
I would like to welcome you all
to Our Lady of Fatima Parish.

03:28.600 --> 03:30.700
Now, I know that
due to the recent renovations

03:30.767 --> 03:32.667
resulting
from the gas explosion,

03:32.734 --> 03:34.600
visits to Oz
have been severely limited,

03:34.667 --> 03:36.100
and this is gonna be
the first chance

03:36.166 --> 03:39.166
that many of you have had
to visit your family members.

03:39.233 --> 03:40.700
- When your name is called,
line up here.

03:40.767 --> 03:43.467
You'll be walking single file
back to Emerald City.

03:43.533 --> 03:47.233
As you know, today's also the
first visiting day in months.

03:47.300 --> 03:50.000
Many of you are anxious to be
together with your families.

03:50.066 --> 03:52.400
So the quicker you
follow instructions,

03:52.467 --> 03:54.467
the sooner you'll be together.

03:54.533 --> 03:55.567
Officer Murphy.

03:55.633 --> 03:58.567
- Number 96A214,
Adams, Philip.

03:58.633 --> 03:59.667
- Carrie Schillinger.

04:00.734 --> 04:01.667
Hello, Carrie, how are you?

04:01.734 --> 04:02.667
How's Jewel today?

04:02.734 --> 04:04.333
- She's fine, thanks.

04:04.400 --> 04:05.900
- Um, Eugenia Hill.

04:05.967 --> 04:07.200
- How are you, Father?

04:07.266 --> 04:09.100
- I'm fine, Mrs. Hill.
How are you today?

04:09.166 --> 04:12.333
- Excited to see my son.
It's been way, way too long.

04:12.400 --> 04:14.033
- Of course.

04:14.100 --> 04:16.834
Sonsyrea Arif.

04:16.900 --> 04:18.000
Welcome.

04:18.066 --> 04:19.233
- As-salaam alaikum.

04:19.300 --> 04:20.934
- Annette Osorio.

04:21.000 --> 04:22.567
- Right here.

04:23.934 --> 04:25.667
Coming.

04:25.734 --> 04:27.233
Coming.

04:30.433 --> 04:31.800
You're cute.

04:36.300 --> 04:37.767
- Let's go.

04:38.867 --> 04:40.800
- Ryan, look.
- Wow.

04:43.867 --> 04:46.834
- Looks good.
Look at this.

04:54.467 --> 04:56.800
- Goddamn.

05:22.867 --> 05:24.166
- Wow.

05:24.233 --> 05:26.000
- It's bigger.
- But not necessarily better.

05:26.066 --> 05:27.000
- I like the new color.

05:27.066 --> 05:28.400
- It's the same color.

05:28.467 --> 05:30.400
- I miss the old place.

05:30.467 --> 05:31.834
- Don't be daft.

05:31.900 --> 05:34.166
- All right, Officer Murphy
will now give out

05:34.233 --> 05:35.333
your cell assignments.

05:35.400 --> 05:36.934
- I want a room
with a view.

05:37.000 --> 05:38.000
- And maid service.

05:38.066 --> 05:39.800
- Number 96A214,

05:39.867 --> 05:42.333
Adams, Philip,
cell number six.

05:44.166 --> 05:46.100
- Over the course of history,
many famous people

05:46.166 --> 05:48.367
have joined the infamous
in prison.

05:48.433 --> 05:50.500
Extraordinary human beings
with noble characters

05:50.567 --> 05:51.867
who, for one reason
or another,

05:51.934 --> 05:53.867
ended up on the wrong side
of the law.

05:53.934 --> 05:55.100
Take...

05:55.166 --> 05:56.934
Thomas Paine.

05:57.000 --> 06:00.800
He was arrested for treason,
for fostering rebellion.

06:00.867 --> 06:02.400
Yet without
his fiery writings,

06:02.467 --> 06:04.800
America might never
have been free.

06:04.867 --> 06:06.000
Or Thomas More...

06:06.066 --> 06:08.133
the statesman, scholar,
and saint

06:08.200 --> 06:10.000
who was sent
to the Tower of London

06:10.066 --> 06:12.100
for being honest
with his king.

06:12.166 --> 06:14.734
More's reward
was to be beheaded.

06:17.433 --> 06:18.533
- Help!

06:18.600 --> 06:19.867
Help me!

06:19.934 --> 06:21.200
Help me!

06:21.266 --> 06:22.400
Help!

06:22.467 --> 06:24.233
Help!

06:24.300 --> 06:27.767
- "And Samson sayeth
unto his brethren,

06:27.834 --> 06:31.567
"'Now shall I be blameless...

06:31.633 --> 06:34.467
when I do harm
the Philistines.'"

06:35.900 --> 06:37.667
My friends,

06:37.734 --> 06:40.367
there are times when we are
guilty for our actions

06:40.433 --> 06:42.800
and should be
punished accordingly.

06:42.867 --> 06:46.233
But there are times
when our actions,

06:46.300 --> 06:50.200
however cruel,
leave us blameless,

06:50.266 --> 06:52.133
because we have punished
the guilty!

06:52.200 --> 06:53.700
all: Amen.

06:53.767 --> 06:56.700
- Now let us pray.

06:56.767 --> 06:59.266
Dear Lord,

06:59.333 --> 07:01.000
we ask you to continue
the recovery

07:01.066 --> 07:03.333
of the Reverend
Jeremiah Cloutier,

07:03.400 --> 07:06.166
who survived
the gas explosion...

07:10.400 --> 07:12.633
Which in turn freed him
from the wall

07:12.700 --> 07:14.667
he had been bricked up
inside of.

07:14.734 --> 07:17.333
Lord, we ask you to bless
the reverend's journey today

07:17.400 --> 07:19.400
as he comes back to Oz
from the burn unit

07:19.467 --> 07:21.433
of Benchley Memorial Hospital.

07:22.834 --> 07:26.667
Lord, we also ask you
to bless Jaz Hoyt...

07:26.734 --> 07:28.433
who took full responsibility

07:28.500 --> 07:31.266
for sealing Reverend Cloutier
in the wall.

07:31.333 --> 07:34.333
Jaz is a good man, Lord,

07:34.400 --> 07:38.100
who suffers needlessly
in solitary confinement.

07:38.166 --> 07:41.500
Look down upon him, Lord,
and keep him strong.

07:47.033 --> 07:50.200
- Gloria, has Cloutier
arrived yet?

07:50.266 --> 07:51.567
- Uh, yeah.

07:51.633 --> 07:53.066
- Well, I need
to see him.

07:53.133 --> 07:55.734
You see, Hoyt was in charge
of rebuilding that kitchen wall,

07:55.800 --> 07:57.667
so I got him
in Solitary,

07:57.734 --> 07:59.367
but he won't say
who else is involved.

07:59.433 --> 08:01.166
So I need Cloutier
to tell me.

08:01.233 --> 08:03.300
- Well, he can't.
Not yet.

08:03.367 --> 08:04.900
His throat was damaged
during the fire.

08:04.967 --> 08:06.300
He can hardly make
any sounds at all.

08:06.367 --> 08:08.100
- Is he conscious?
- Occasionally.

08:08.166 --> 08:09.600
- Then he can nod his
fucking head yes or no

08:09.667 --> 08:10.767
when I read him
the list of names.

08:10.834 --> 08:11.800
Where is he?

08:11.867 --> 08:13.900
- In the private room.

08:13.967 --> 08:15.367
Tim, wait.

08:16.900 --> 08:19.567
He was very badly burned
during the explosion.

08:19.633 --> 08:22.900
I mean, the fact that
he survived at all is a miracle.

08:22.967 --> 08:24.400
- Hallelujah.

08:24.467 --> 08:26.533
- I just want to prepare you
for what you're gonna see.

08:42.367 --> 08:44.066
- You got any visitors
coming today?

08:44.133 --> 08:46.000
- Yeah, my sister, Annette.

08:46.066 --> 08:47.333
- Nice.

08:47.400 --> 08:50.734
- Yeah, she's a great gal.
I love her to death.

08:50.800 --> 08:53.300
She's always been there
for me when I needed her.

08:53.367 --> 08:55.467
And she's also
a bit of a head case.

09:01.066 --> 09:02.967
- Got a light?

09:03.033 --> 09:04.734
- Oh, no, there's no smoking.

09:04.800 --> 09:06.166
- Oh.

09:06.233 --> 09:07.867
Scooch over.

09:08.967 --> 09:10.800
I want to sit down.

09:15.633 --> 09:18.533
I hope you didn't mind
when I got on the bus,

09:18.600 --> 09:20.100
me flirting with you.

09:21.166 --> 09:23.867
- No, I...

09:23.934 --> 09:25.533
- You know, 'cause I know
how you priests

09:25.600 --> 09:27.266
don't go in for girls.

09:27.333 --> 09:28.300
- Well, you know,
actually, we--

09:28.367 --> 09:29.834
- Oh, no, I'm sorry.

09:29.900 --> 09:31.300
That came out wrong.

09:31.367 --> 09:33.500
I mean...

09:33.567 --> 09:35.567
you swear to God
you'll never have sex.

09:35.633 --> 09:37.834
- Well, yes, but--
- Do you know my brother?

09:37.900 --> 09:40.433
- Sure, he comes to Mass
every Sunday.

09:40.500 --> 09:43.467
- Enrique at Mass?

09:44.967 --> 09:48.033
Jesus, he must be bored
out of his mind.

09:48.100 --> 09:51.000
Oh, no, I'm--

09:51.066 --> 09:52.767
that came out wrong.

09:52.834 --> 09:57.166
I'm sure you give a very
cheery service, Father.

09:57.233 --> 09:59.600
Only my brother's not,
like, you know,

09:59.667 --> 10:01.433
of the churchgoing variety.

10:01.500 --> 10:03.734
- Yeah, well, I got to admit
that most of the guys just come

10:03.800 --> 10:05.734
because they want
to break the monotony.

10:07.033 --> 10:10.333
- I haven't seen Enrique
in three years.

10:10.400 --> 10:12.700
I've been in South Beach.

10:12.767 --> 10:13.967
- What were you doing
down there?

10:14.033 --> 10:16.533
- Bartending, mostly.

10:16.600 --> 10:18.367
You know, I tried to go
for some modeling jobs

10:18.433 --> 10:20.066
'cause I got
a good figure,

10:20.133 --> 10:23.300
but you know, I wasn't
willing to play the games,

10:23.367 --> 10:24.633
you know what I'm saying?

10:24.700 --> 10:25.934
- Yeah, I think I do.

10:26.000 --> 10:28.300
The guys try to
take advantage, huh?

10:28.367 --> 10:32.133
- Exactly, which is why
I need to speak to Enrique,

10:32.200 --> 10:36.600
'cause one certain guy
took too much advantage.

10:36.667 --> 10:39.066
My fucking husband.

10:39.133 --> 10:40.567
- He hurt you?

10:41.734 --> 10:44.400
- I loved that Cuban cocksucker
with all of my heart,

10:44.467 --> 10:46.266
and he cuts a chunk
out of me.

10:46.333 --> 10:48.433
I need Enrique
to talk to Javier.

10:48.500 --> 10:50.667
- To call him from Oz?

10:50.734 --> 10:52.934
- Well, my brother's voice
travels far.

10:53.000 --> 10:55.934
He don't need a phone,
if you know what I'm saying.

10:56.000 --> 10:59.033
- No, please don't
tell me any more.

10:59.100 --> 11:00.567
- You're a priest.

11:00.633 --> 11:01.900
You can't say nothing
to nobody.

11:01.967 --> 11:03.400
- No, that's only
during confession.

11:03.467 --> 11:04.867
We're not in a confessional.

11:04.934 --> 11:05.867
We're on a bus.

11:05.934 --> 11:07.533
- Oh, don't get so technical.

11:07.600 --> 11:09.033
- Uh, Annette,

11:09.100 --> 11:11.266
what you're about to ask
your brother is wrong.

11:11.333 --> 11:12.900
- Bullshit!
Look at my arm.

11:12.967 --> 11:15.000
- I didn't say that what
your husband did was right.

11:15.066 --> 11:18.033
I'm just saying that that's
not gonna solve the problem.

11:18.100 --> 11:19.633
- Fuck you,

11:19.700 --> 11:22.100
you self-righteous jizzball.

11:22.166 --> 11:23.700
You don't know dick
about dick,

11:23.767 --> 11:26.400
and that came out exactly
the way I meant it!

11:48.300 --> 11:49.600
- Listen up!

11:49.667 --> 11:51.767
When I give the order,
you are to walk

11:51.834 --> 11:55.000
from your cell
and form a single line.

11:56.734 --> 11:57.967
Step out.

12:02.800 --> 12:04.467
All right.
- Hey, what's going on?

12:04.533 --> 12:06.066
- No talking.

12:12.133 --> 12:13.834
- Holy shit.

12:13.900 --> 12:16.367
- New and improved.

12:16.433 --> 12:18.700
- No talking.

12:18.767 --> 12:21.033
- Okay.

12:21.100 --> 12:22.700
During the reconstruction,
we discovered

12:22.767 --> 12:24.033
that there were problems
in the air ducts

12:24.100 --> 12:25.767
throughout the building.

12:25.834 --> 12:29.367
We need to clean out the ducts
in Solitary.

12:29.433 --> 12:32.333
And so, until that job
is complete,

12:32.400 --> 12:34.467
I'm gonna put you all
back into Gen Pop.

12:34.533 --> 12:35.633
- Hey.
- There you go.

12:35.700 --> 12:36.633
- Awesome.

12:36.700 --> 12:37.834
- No talking!

12:37.900 --> 12:39.400
- I didn't say shit.

12:39.467 --> 12:41.867
- Now, this is a second chance
for you slugs.

12:41.934 --> 12:44.300
If you behave yourself
over the next few days,

12:44.367 --> 12:46.934
you won't have to
return to Solitary.

12:47.000 --> 12:49.066
Understood?

12:49.133 --> 12:50.834
Don't fuck this opportunity up.

12:50.900 --> 12:52.367
- Warden?

12:52.433 --> 12:54.400
Exactly what
is the problem with--

12:54.467 --> 12:55.867
with the air ducts?

12:55.934 --> 12:57.734
- That's none of
your concern, White.

12:57.800 --> 12:59.433
- What air duct--that's the air
we breathe, right?

12:59.500 --> 13:00.767
You're talking about--ow!

13:00.834 --> 13:02.000
- What part of "no talking"
don't you understand?

13:02.066 --> 13:03.767
- Shit! Damn, man.

13:03.834 --> 13:05.533
I got a constitutional right
to breathe fresh air.

13:05.600 --> 13:06.834
- Oh, yeah?
- You know.

13:06.900 --> 13:09.000
Fuck a duck.
- Breathe, brother, breathe.

13:23.767 --> 13:25.033
- Whoa, where are
you going?

13:25.100 --> 13:26.300
- To see McManus.
- He ain't here.

13:26.367 --> 13:27.700
Get back in line.

13:31.700 --> 13:33.734
- Look who's back.
The girls are back.

13:36.200 --> 13:37.967
- We missed you, man.

13:49.000 --> 13:50.767
- Welcome home, Miguel.

13:50.834 --> 13:52.834
Been hoping and praying
for this day.

13:52.900 --> 13:55.867
We got unsettled business,
you and me.

13:55.934 --> 13:57.467
- Oh, yeah?
- You killed my boys.

13:57.533 --> 14:00.066
Carlo Ricardo
and Jorge Vasquez.

14:00.133 --> 14:01.900
You got to pay.

14:03.233 --> 14:08.066
- Spit, sweat, blood.

14:08.133 --> 14:09.667
- What?

14:09.734 --> 14:13.133
- Bodily fluids, you know?
Fluids the body produces.

14:13.200 --> 14:15.734
Piss and tears.

14:15.800 --> 14:18.133
Some are voluntary,
some not so voluntary.

14:18.200 --> 14:19.967
When I was in my cubbyhole,
you know,

14:20.033 --> 14:23.100
I had a lot of time to think
about my fluids

14:23.166 --> 14:25.867
and my juices, you know,
my shit.

14:25.934 --> 14:28.667
- You're fuckin' nuts,
Alvarez.

14:28.734 --> 14:30.200
- Yeah, that's right.

14:30.266 --> 14:32.533
That's right, that's me.
I'm fucking nuts.

14:35.533 --> 14:38.233
You say I got to pay?

14:38.300 --> 14:41.066
Fine, put this
on my tab, okay?

14:42.233 --> 14:44.200
- Hey, what the fuck's
going on in here?

14:44.266 --> 14:45.533
- We're taking showers.

14:45.600 --> 14:46.734
- With your clothes on?

14:46.800 --> 14:49.767
Up against the wall,
come on, move it.

14:49.834 --> 14:52.433
- What, me too?

14:52.500 --> 14:54.433
- No, I can see
you're clean.

14:57.767 --> 14:59.500
All right, confine these
two dinks to their cells.

14:59.567 --> 15:01.433
Put Guerra in the cage.

15:01.500 --> 15:03.200
Come on, move it!

15:03.266 --> 15:05.133
You got anything else
to say, Alvarez?

15:05.200 --> 15:09.500
- Man is 80% water!

15:13.400 --> 15:16.433
- Hey, Miguel,
you are one lucky fuck.

15:16.500 --> 15:17.800
- Oh, yeah.

15:17.867 --> 15:20.600
That--that's me.
You know, I'm Mr. Lucky.

15:20.667 --> 15:22.667
- You know Guerra
wants you dead,

15:22.734 --> 15:25.033
but I can yank him
off your ass.

15:25.100 --> 15:26.633
- Oh, yeah,
if I do what, huh?

15:26.700 --> 15:28.834
If I kill somebody
for you?

15:28.900 --> 15:31.066
Those days are gone, chica.

15:31.133 --> 15:32.967
Those days are long gone.

15:33.033 --> 15:36.100
See, I got no interest
in sniffing the butthole.

15:36.166 --> 15:38.000
- You won't survive solo.

15:38.066 --> 15:39.000
You ain't got the balls.

15:39.066 --> 15:40.400
- I ain't got what?

15:40.467 --> 15:41.867
- The balls, cojones, pendejo,
is what I'm saying.

15:43.100 --> 15:44.967
Right, right, right,
you see this?

15:45.033 --> 15:47.600
I did that.

15:47.667 --> 15:50.500
Yeah, I cut my own face,
you know what I'm saying?

15:50.567 --> 15:52.834
I shoved a shank
in Rivera's eyes.

15:52.900 --> 15:54.233
You know what I'm saying?

15:54.300 --> 15:56.533
I slit Vasquez's throat.

15:56.600 --> 15:58.033
You know what I'm saying?

15:58.100 --> 16:00.700
I handle a knife better
than a fucking surgeon.

16:00.767 --> 16:03.066
I got nothing to prove
to you, brother.

16:03.133 --> 16:04.633
Nothing.

16:06.834 --> 16:09.233
Come on, get the fuck
out of my face!

16:14.734 --> 16:16.133
Hey, Giles.

16:16.200 --> 16:18.133
Yeah.

16:18.200 --> 16:20.900
Think I haven't forgotten
about you sticking me, right?

16:20.967 --> 16:22.800
Little fucking cocksucker.

16:22.867 --> 16:24.033
- Yeah!

16:24.100 --> 16:26.834
- Hey!
- Yeah!

16:40.166 --> 16:43.033
- This incident with Giles
concerns me, Alvarez.

16:43.100 --> 16:44.934
You want to stay
out of Solitary,

16:45.000 --> 16:46.900
you've got to stay
out of trouble.

16:46.967 --> 16:49.767
- You and me both know
that I'm going back to Solitary

16:49.834 --> 16:51.467
no matter what I do.

16:51.533 --> 16:53.467
Glynn's not gonna
let me run around free.

16:53.533 --> 16:57.467
And even if you did
convince him to, I'm doomed.

16:57.533 --> 16:59.800
You know?

16:59.867 --> 17:01.900
Attract trouble
like a fucking magnet.

17:07.400 --> 17:09.934
You know what
quicksilver is?

17:10.000 --> 17:11.333
- Quicksilver?
- Yeah.

17:11.400 --> 17:14.200
- Yeah, it's like
mercury, right?

17:14.266 --> 17:15.834
Stuff they make
mirrors with.

17:15.900 --> 17:20.266
- Mirrors, yeah.

17:20.333 --> 17:21.967
Reflections, right?

17:22.033 --> 17:24.467
It's just this
whole change in mood,

17:24.533 --> 17:26.367
you know what I'm saying?

17:26.433 --> 17:28.100
I mean, that's just me, man.

17:28.166 --> 17:31.367
That's me, McManus.

17:31.433 --> 17:35.166
You know, I'm just--
I'm quicksilver, man.

17:37.967 --> 17:41.200
Whoosh, you know?

17:45.567 --> 17:47.633
- Hey, Guerra!

17:51.266 --> 17:53.767
You know, you look
like a fuckin' gorilla

17:53.834 --> 17:55.467
I seen one time
in the fuckin' Bronx Zoo.

17:55.533 --> 17:57.066
- Fuck you.

17:57.133 --> 17:58.900
You better hope they don't
let me out of here soon, White,

17:58.967 --> 18:00.734
'cause your fuckin'
black ass is mine.

18:00.800 --> 18:02.300
- Ooh.

18:02.367 --> 18:04.700
Hey! Anybody got a banana

18:04.767 --> 18:07.100
I can feed to the fuckin' ape?

18:07.166 --> 18:08.700
- Omar.

18:09.533 --> 18:11.100
- There you are.

18:11.166 --> 18:12.500
I've been waiting
to see you.

18:12.567 --> 18:16.166
May I step forward,
please?

18:16.233 --> 18:18.467
- All right, yeah.

18:21.700 --> 18:23.967
- I know I'm always saying
I'm sorry for all this nonsense

18:24.033 --> 18:25.700
I keep getting
sucked into.

18:25.767 --> 18:27.533
Kicking you
and stabbing you and shit.

18:27.600 --> 18:29.500
- What, man?

18:29.567 --> 18:31.500
- Well, when the hacks told me
I was coming back to Em City,

18:31.567 --> 18:35.567
I said, McManus--
McManus is the man, son, yo.

18:35.633 --> 18:38.600
I mean, he got
a heart as big as--

18:38.667 --> 18:41.066
I don't know what's
as big as your heart.

18:41.133 --> 18:42.433
- All right.

18:42.500 --> 18:43.700
- No, no, wait, wait, wait,
I know what I'm saying--

18:43.767 --> 18:44.867
- Don't fucking touch me.

18:44.934 --> 18:46.233
- Even if I'm not saying
the right words.

18:46.300 --> 18:49.233
Look, I'm gonna make good
this time, I promise.

18:49.300 --> 18:51.567
- You know, I'm glad that you're
willing to make another effort,

18:51.633 --> 18:54.500
but I got to ask you
a question.

18:54.567 --> 18:56.266
Why the fuck did you
get so upset with me?

18:56.333 --> 18:58.066
Why'd you kick me
in the head?

18:58.133 --> 18:59.333
- Look, you know,

18:59.400 --> 19:00.934
there I am sitting there
watching TV, right?

19:01.000 --> 19:02.800
And there you come up on
the screen big as day, right?

19:02.867 --> 19:05.934
And Guerra, fucking Guerra!

19:06.000 --> 19:07.233
He started making fun.

19:07.300 --> 19:08.233
That's how the fight
got started.

19:08.300 --> 19:09.567
- Look, I know all this shit.

19:09.633 --> 19:12.033
Why did you
fucking attack me?

19:13.800 --> 19:15.433
- 'Cause you didn't
say nothing to me, man.

19:15.500 --> 19:16.834
- About what?

19:16.900 --> 19:20.133
- About being a contestant
on fucking "Up Your Ante."

19:21.200 --> 19:23.100
- I think I know this.

19:23.166 --> 19:25.100
- I mean, here I--
I think we--

19:25.166 --> 19:27.367
we getting all friendly,
you know.

19:27.433 --> 19:30.700
We shared our thoughts
and feelings,

19:30.767 --> 19:31.934
and then...

19:32.000 --> 19:34.066
I got to find out
you're on TV

19:34.133 --> 19:36.467
the same time as all the rest
of them fucks.

19:38.667 --> 19:40.233
- Oh.

19:41.667 --> 19:43.500
- As a matter of fact, uh...

19:46.266 --> 19:49.567
You sort of owe me an apology.

19:49.633 --> 19:51.800
- Me apologize to you?
- Uh-huh.

19:52.867 --> 19:54.467
- Work detail!

19:55.633 --> 19:57.300
- Go to work, Omar.

20:10.533 --> 20:12.400
- Here you go, Burr.

20:12.467 --> 20:15.734
Hot and tasty,
just the way you like it.

20:15.800 --> 20:16.934
- Appreciate it.

20:17.000 --> 20:18.367
- Maricón.

20:21.433 --> 20:22.900
- Stupid fucking spics.

20:22.967 --> 20:24.133
- Don't worry.

20:24.200 --> 20:25.633
You're gonna
get your chance

20:25.700 --> 20:28.700
to hack up Chico Guerra
soon enough.

20:30.667 --> 20:33.767
- That's just
the thing of it.

20:33.834 --> 20:35.000
I'm tired.

20:35.066 --> 20:37.233
I don't want to
hack anybody up anymore.

20:38.734 --> 20:42.133
I'm really,
really, really trying.

20:42.200 --> 20:43.867
I'm trying to keep it
on the straight and narrow

20:43.934 --> 20:46.233
and up and up,
you know what I'm saying?

20:46.300 --> 20:49.934
- Hey, negro estupido.

20:51.567 --> 20:53.767
- Hey, tamale boy,

20:53.834 --> 20:57.567
why don't you shut
your fucking mouth?

20:57.633 --> 20:58.767
- What?

20:58.834 --> 21:00.867
Guerra's not
the gorilla, you are.

21:03.834 --> 21:04.934
- Get him out!

21:05.000 --> 21:06.367
- Motherfucker!

21:06.433 --> 21:07.800
Black bitch
nigga motherfucker!

21:07.867 --> 21:08.967
I'm gonna fucking get you.

21:09.033 --> 21:11.333
Get the fuck off me,
you bitch!

21:13.800 --> 21:16.734
- What'd you say
about a banana?

21:35.033 --> 21:37.066
- Back in the day
before the day,

21:37.133 --> 21:40.133
explorers would set out on ships
to discover new worlds.

21:40.200 --> 21:43.233
Adventurers like Marco Polo
and Christopher Columbus

21:43.300 --> 21:46.333
would sail into the horizon,
not sure if they'd find a place

21:46.400 --> 21:48.700
to land or fall off
the edge of the Earth.

21:48.767 --> 21:51.967
As a result of their journeys,
both Polo and Columbus

21:52.033 --> 21:57.300
got fame, fortune,
and a pair of leg irons.

21:57.367 --> 21:58.633
That's right.

21:58.700 --> 22:01.834
The man who "discovered"
America was a con,

22:01.900 --> 22:03.767
arrested for embezzlement.

22:03.834 --> 22:06.467
After a few months
in a dank, dirty dungeon,

22:06.533 --> 22:08.900
I bet old Chris
started wishing

22:08.967 --> 22:10.467
he had fallen off
the edge of the Earth.

22:16.166 --> 22:17.700
- Thanks, Father M.

22:17.767 --> 22:18.867
- She was giggling. Here.

22:18.934 --> 22:20.934
- She's excited
to see her grandpa.

22:21.000 --> 22:23.300
We had the blood tests
done, you know.

22:23.367 --> 22:24.834
Hank was definitely the dad.

22:24.900 --> 22:27.266
- I heard.
- Yeah.

22:27.333 --> 22:29.834
I just want Mr. Schillinger to
be there for Jewel, you know?

22:29.900 --> 22:32.033
I mean, we don't
have anyone else.

22:32.100 --> 22:33.667
- What about
your parents?

22:33.734 --> 22:36.200
- My folks are back
in Montana.

22:36.266 --> 22:38.500
They don't give two shits
about Jewel and me.

22:38.567 --> 22:41.266
- Maybe in time, Carrie.

22:42.700 --> 22:44.600
- Maybe.

22:46.033 --> 22:47.700
Video games.

22:47.767 --> 22:49.567
- I beg your pardon?

22:49.633 --> 22:54.033
- Hank played video games
all day and into night.

22:54.100 --> 22:55.567
Video games
and videos.

22:55.633 --> 22:57.166
He watched that
"Natural Born Killers,"

22:57.233 --> 22:59.100
like, 60 times.

22:59.166 --> 23:00.967
I just think that, you know,
maybe if he hadn't,

23:01.033 --> 23:02.500
he'd still be alive.

23:02.567 --> 23:04.100
- I don't think
it's that simple, Carrie.

23:04.166 --> 23:07.734
Hank's upbringing,
family life, education,

23:07.800 --> 23:10.166
they all had a lot to do
with making him who he was.

23:13.834 --> 23:16.066
- Can you bless my baby, Father?

23:16.133 --> 23:19.633
Can you take away the curse
that's on her head?

23:19.700 --> 23:20.867
- Curse?

23:20.934 --> 23:23.100
- The one that killed
Hank and his brother,

23:23.166 --> 23:26.600
the one that put
Mr. Schillinger in Oz.

23:26.667 --> 23:28.900
I just want my girl
to be happy, you know?

23:28.967 --> 23:30.700
Have a happy life.

23:33.200 --> 23:35.367
- All right,
I'll say a prayer.

23:39.734 --> 23:41.867
- I can't wait to see
my granddaughter.

23:41.934 --> 23:44.900
- Christ, are you gonna get
all mushy again?

23:46.200 --> 23:48.934
- Grub, boys.

23:49.000 --> 23:50.200
- Who the fuck
you calling "boy"?

23:50.266 --> 23:51.834
- Ooh, I'm sorry there,
Schillinger.

23:51.900 --> 23:53.500
I know you're having
a rough recovery and all.

23:53.567 --> 23:56.667
I don't want to say nothing
to loosen up them sutures.

23:56.734 --> 23:58.000
- Hey, hey, what'd you do,

23:58.066 --> 23:59.800
serve everybody else
in this fucking prison

23:59.867 --> 24:01.233
and then bring us
the shit leftovers?

24:01.300 --> 24:03.300
- Robson, you been in Oz
all this time,

24:03.367 --> 24:07.433
and now you're gonna be
a food critic, huh?

24:07.500 --> 24:09.600
Ooh, you scare me, ooh.

24:12.200 --> 24:13.800
- We got to get back
to Gen Pop,

24:13.867 --> 24:15.667
or I'm gonna go stir crazy.

24:15.734 --> 24:17.900
- Dr. Nathan says
we're at full speed.

24:17.967 --> 24:20.000
- It's time to take down
Kareem Said.

24:20.066 --> 24:23.633
- That fucking nigger's gonna
live to regret shanking us.

24:26.834 --> 24:30.967
Them Muslims got what
they call a jihad, holy war.

24:31.033 --> 24:33.600
Well, they ain't seen war
like what's coming.

24:33.667 --> 24:36.233
- Jihad?

24:37.200 --> 24:38.600
Yee-ha!

24:43.333 --> 24:44.767
- You want to
go to the Hole?

24:44.834 --> 24:46.834
- You can't put me
in the Hole.

24:46.900 --> 24:48.266
I'm recuperating.

24:48.333 --> 24:51.033
- Health care,
it's a bitch.

24:53.600 --> 24:55.467
- Thank you.

24:55.533 --> 24:56.567
Said.

24:57.967 --> 24:59.433
Said.

25:09.433 --> 25:11.233
- Look, the warden
has decided to charge you

25:11.300 --> 25:15.500
with attempted murder for
stabbing Robson and Schillinger.

25:15.567 --> 25:17.333
You want me to arrange
for a public defender?

25:17.400 --> 25:19.433
- No.

25:19.500 --> 25:21.367
- You intend to
represent yourself?

25:21.433 --> 25:22.767
- No.

25:24.800 --> 25:26.767
I intend to plead guilty.

25:36.600 --> 25:39.033
- Said's in a dark
and ugly place.

25:39.100 --> 25:41.100
- Why should he be any different
than anyone else in Oz?

25:41.166 --> 25:43.567
- Since he killed Adebisi,
I've watched him become

25:43.633 --> 25:46.633
more and more angry,
violent.

25:46.700 --> 25:48.567
This thing with Robson
and Schillinger is just

25:48.633 --> 25:50.467
one more piece
in a long decline.

25:50.533 --> 25:52.433
- He was defending
Tobias Beecher.

25:52.500 --> 25:54.834
- Yeah, but I'm not debating
his motives, Pete,

25:54.900 --> 25:56.333
just his methods.

25:56.400 --> 25:58.600
The old Said would have
never resorted to violence,

25:58.667 --> 26:00.400
at least not
as a first step.

26:00.467 --> 26:02.233
- Well, I'm releasing Robson
and Schillinger today.

26:02.300 --> 26:03.567
- Oh, great.

26:03.633 --> 26:04.600
- Can't you keep them
in the ward longer?

26:04.667 --> 26:05.867
- No, their wounds have healed,

26:05.934 --> 26:07.266
and I need the beds.

26:07.333 --> 26:09.233
- Then give 'em
a little Valium, some Prozac,

26:09.300 --> 26:11.133
anything that'll
keep 'em calm.

26:11.200 --> 26:13.033
- Well, why not
medicate everybody?

26:13.100 --> 26:14.400
- Okay.

26:14.467 --> 26:16.400
- Listen up,
I'm not gonna take any shit

26:16.467 --> 26:18.433
from the Aryans or the Muslims.

26:18.500 --> 26:20.166
I intend to
tell them so.

26:20.233 --> 26:23.633
I want everyone
in the cafeteria at 3:00.

27:03.133 --> 27:05.066
- Don't you want
your mail, Kareem?

27:29.967 --> 27:31.433
- Get the fuck back!

27:42.867 --> 27:44.734
- Hey, Tobias.

27:44.800 --> 27:46.533
What do you think
of the office?

27:46.600 --> 27:48.400
- It's very snazzy.
- Yeah.

27:48.467 --> 27:49.567
- And they finally
upgraded my computer.

27:49.633 --> 27:52.033
I've got 128 megabytes of RAM.

27:54.633 --> 27:57.033
- How is Said?

27:57.100 --> 27:58.300
- He seems fine.

27:58.367 --> 28:00.400
- Mm, there's concern
among the staff

28:00.467 --> 28:02.667
about the Muslims
and Aryans.

28:02.734 --> 28:05.567
- For good reason.

28:05.633 --> 28:09.166
- In the shower this morning,
I had a thought...

28:09.233 --> 28:11.967
about you.

28:12.033 --> 28:13.166
- You were thinking about me

28:13.233 --> 28:15.800
while you were naked
in the shower?

28:15.867 --> 28:18.133
- Oh, boy.

28:18.200 --> 28:20.533
You and Said are friends,

28:20.600 --> 28:22.467
and you and Schillinger
were getting along,

28:22.533 --> 28:25.300
at least until he heard
about your possible parole.

28:25.367 --> 28:28.900
What if I could organize
an interaction

28:28.967 --> 28:32.900
between Schillinger,
Said, and you?

28:32.967 --> 28:35.867
If you can broker a peace
between these two,

28:35.934 --> 28:37.533
you'll save a lot of lives.

28:37.600 --> 28:41.500
And when you're up for parole
again at the end of the year...

28:41.567 --> 28:43.500
- I'll smell even sweeter.

28:45.900 --> 28:47.667
- Yeah.

28:47.734 --> 28:49.767
Imagine that.

28:49.834 --> 28:53.166
Said, Schillinger,
and I in a three-way.

28:56.433 --> 28:58.233
- No, absolutely not.

28:58.300 --> 29:00.100
I'm not going
anywhere near Said.

29:00.166 --> 29:01.333
- Vern...

29:01.400 --> 29:04.567
- My people don't associate
with his kind.

29:04.633 --> 29:06.200
- Yet you have
in the past.

29:06.266 --> 29:08.567
Like when you asked Said
to represent you

29:08.633 --> 29:11.600
in your conspiracy
to commit murder trial.

29:11.667 --> 29:13.100
- That was different.

29:13.166 --> 29:14.900
- How?

29:14.967 --> 29:17.400
- He hadn't shanked me then.

29:17.467 --> 29:19.333
- That is exactly
why the two of you

29:19.400 --> 29:20.667
have to sit down together,

29:20.734 --> 29:23.266
and that's why Tobias Beecher
has to be there.

29:23.333 --> 29:25.000
Vern...

29:26.233 --> 29:28.433
Remember when
you came to me,

29:28.500 --> 29:29.800
wanting to make sense
of your life

29:29.867 --> 29:31.467
so that you could find
some peace of mind,

29:31.533 --> 29:32.734
some happiness?

29:32.800 --> 29:34.233
This is the same.

29:34.300 --> 29:37.433
You'll be able to express
whatever it is

29:37.500 --> 29:39.500
you're truly feeling inside.

29:39.567 --> 29:41.867
- What I feel inside...

29:44.166 --> 29:46.133
Is rage.

29:46.200 --> 29:47.233
- But you're smart enough
to know

29:47.300 --> 29:49.367
that there's no comfort
in rage.

29:49.433 --> 29:53.700
Rage feeds off the soul,

29:53.767 --> 29:56.500
till there is no soul left.

30:00.066 --> 30:01.700
- I call.

30:04.600 --> 30:05.834
Beecher, I call.

30:05.900 --> 30:07.533
- Huh?

30:07.600 --> 30:09.033
- You want to play cards,
or you want to dick around?

30:09.100 --> 30:10.266
- I'm out.

30:10.333 --> 30:11.266
- All right, great.

30:11.333 --> 30:13.266
- My deal, right?
- Yes.

30:13.333 --> 30:16.834
- Something going on,
Tobias?

30:16.900 --> 30:18.033
- This is Oz, Bob.

30:18.100 --> 30:20.066
There's always something
going on.

30:21.533 --> 30:24.100
216.

30:24.166 --> 30:25.734
- What's that?

30:25.800 --> 30:28.266
- Number of days till
my next parole hearing.

30:29.800 --> 30:31.033
- Two matches.

30:31.100 --> 30:34.233
Beecher, I bet two.

30:34.300 --> 30:36.033
Are you in or out?

30:36.100 --> 30:38.400
- I am in.

30:40.433 --> 30:42.467
- Oh, good, ah...

30:42.533 --> 30:45.433
sit down, gentlemen,
sit down.

30:46.567 --> 30:47.667
Sit down.

30:49.934 --> 30:52.100
I spoke to the three of you
individually

30:52.166 --> 30:56.133
to explain what I hope
we can accomplish here.

30:56.200 --> 30:59.200
I know there's a lot
of skepticism on your part,

30:59.266 --> 31:02.433
and so I appreciate
your giving this a try.

31:02.500 --> 31:04.166
- We must always
choose life over death.

31:04.233 --> 31:06.000
- Hey, you're the one who
shanked me in the back, pal.

31:06.066 --> 31:08.233
- Kareem, Vern, please,
you know the rules.

31:08.300 --> 31:09.700
Each of you will get
a chance to speak.

31:09.767 --> 31:12.633
First, I want to hear
from Tobias.

31:16.233 --> 31:17.834
Yeah.

31:17.900 --> 31:20.033
I do feel a certain sense
of responsibility

31:20.100 --> 31:23.767
about what happened that day
in the library.

31:23.834 --> 31:25.867
You were happy that my parole
got turned down,

31:25.934 --> 31:28.934
and given all the shit
that's gone on between us,

31:29.000 --> 31:31.200
I can understand that.

31:31.266 --> 31:34.200
And you saw him and Robson
in my face threatening me,

31:34.266 --> 31:38.033
and you wanted to help,
and I can appreciate that too.

31:38.100 --> 31:39.567
So...

31:39.633 --> 31:44.033
you were both
justified, mostly,

31:44.100 --> 31:45.767
in the way you behaved.

31:45.834 --> 31:47.633
- Question.
- Go ahead.

31:47.700 --> 31:50.500
- Beecher, would I have been
justified shanking Said?

31:50.567 --> 31:51.700
- I wouldn't have
been taunting him.

31:51.767 --> 31:53.166
- Kareem.

31:54.433 --> 31:56.633
- Do you mean if
the circumstances were reversed

31:56.700 --> 31:59.700
and Said was threatening me?

31:59.767 --> 32:01.166
- Uh-huh.

32:01.233 --> 32:03.300
- Yes, I think you'd be
justified in stabbing him.

32:03.367 --> 32:05.100
- Horseshit.

32:06.633 --> 32:08.033
- Here's why.

32:09.233 --> 32:12.533
And you're gonna want
to have Sister Pete

32:12.600 --> 32:14.734
send me to the state asylum
when you hear this one.

32:16.166 --> 32:17.734
You two are
exactly alike.

32:17.800 --> 32:19.000
- What?
- You are crazy.

32:19.066 --> 32:21.166
- Listen to him.

32:23.333 --> 32:26.133
- You are both
powerful men.

32:26.200 --> 32:29.734
Not only natural-born leaders,

32:29.800 --> 32:31.734
but each of you has
a vision of the world,

32:31.800 --> 32:34.400
and even though those visions
are in direct opposition,

32:34.467 --> 32:37.100
they do share some things
in common.

32:37.166 --> 32:38.734
- Like what?

32:38.800 --> 32:41.433
- You both believe
in your people,

32:41.500 --> 32:43.367
in the rights of your people

32:43.433 --> 32:46.333
and the God-given gifts
owed to your people.

32:46.400 --> 32:50.233
You both believe that
your people deserve a full life,

32:50.300 --> 32:53.867
happiness, security...

32:56.033 --> 32:57.400
And...

32:59.433 --> 33:03.100
I don't know, I guess
that's all I have to say.

33:05.800 --> 33:07.600
- That's good,
that's...

33:07.667 --> 33:09.600
that's enough for today.

33:09.667 --> 33:11.633
I think we should think
about what Tobias said

33:11.700 --> 33:14.467
and come back tomorrow.

33:16.934 --> 33:17.900
Officer.

33:21.300 --> 33:24.166
- Rapists, pedophiles,
male hustlers.

33:24.233 --> 33:26.567
We got all kinds
of men in Oz.

33:26.633 --> 33:29.166
Men who've turned sex
into a crime.

33:29.233 --> 33:30.400
And for that, they belong

33:30.467 --> 33:32.266
in the deepest recesses
of our hell.

33:32.333 --> 33:35.934
But as we also know,
sex is not necessarily love.

33:36.000 --> 33:38.100
And there are times
when love itself

33:38.166 --> 33:41.200
will get you incarcerated,
like Oscar Wilde...

33:41.266 --> 33:43.567
who loved,

33:43.633 --> 33:46.500
and lost two years of his life

33:46.567 --> 33:48.700
sitting in Reading Gaol.

33:50.266 --> 33:51.734
Two lips,

33:51.800 --> 33:56.433
maybe a little tongue
pressed against two other lips.

33:56.500 --> 33:58.867
A simple kiss...

33:58.934 --> 34:01.367
can be more lethal
than a gun.

34:06.734 --> 34:08.233
- Addiction is Satan's tool,

34:08.300 --> 34:10.400
his evil system
to keep our people down.

34:10.467 --> 34:12.600
He supplies the drugs
to our men and women,

34:12.667 --> 34:14.767
and then arrests them
for using.

34:14.834 --> 34:16.867
He locks our sons
and daughters in his prisons

34:16.934 --> 34:18.533
and then walks away,

34:18.600 --> 34:20.166
a smile across
his white face.

34:20.233 --> 34:23.700
- Uh, Mrs. Arif,
I hate to...

34:23.767 --> 34:25.700
some of the other passengers
on board have asked me

34:25.767 --> 34:27.633
to ask you if you could
keep your voice down.

34:27.700 --> 34:29.433
-  Why?

34:29.500 --> 34:31.300
Because they don't want
to hear the truth?

34:31.367 --> 34:33.400
The drug policy
in this country

34:33.467 --> 34:35.367
is excessive, oppressive,
and racist!

34:35.433 --> 34:36.667
- Well, be that as it may--

34:36.734 --> 34:38.734
- Instead of locking
young black men behind bars,

34:38.800 --> 34:40.667
we ought to implement
substance abuse treatment,

34:40.734 --> 34:42.834
which is less expensive
and more productive.

34:42.900 --> 34:45.100
- Well, I agree, but now's
not the time--

34:45.166 --> 34:47.300
- When is the time?

34:47.367 --> 34:49.734
Did you know that the number
of inmates in American prisons

34:49.800 --> 34:51.767
has more than tripled
in the last 20 years?

34:51.834 --> 34:53.233
- Yes.

34:53.300 --> 34:55.200
- Did you know that
if the inmate population

34:55.266 --> 34:58.967
continues to grow exponentially,
by the year 2053,

34:59.033 --> 35:02.867
the United States will have
more people in prison than out?

35:02.934 --> 35:04.467
So I ask you, Father.

35:04.533 --> 35:06.867
How long do we wait to
change the way things are?

35:09.367 --> 35:11.600
- Her baby's trying to sleep.

35:18.834 --> 35:20.934
- Your husband's a drug addict?

35:21.000 --> 35:23.867
- He was,
until he found Allah.

35:23.934 --> 35:27.400
- My son, Augustus,
he was too.

35:27.467 --> 35:29.066
- 70% of those arrested

35:29.133 --> 35:31.233
test positive
for substance abuse.

35:31.300 --> 35:33.000
- Ms. Arif--
- Sonsyrea.

35:33.066 --> 35:34.900
- Sonsyrea,

35:34.967 --> 35:38.734
your head's all crammed
with facts and figures.

35:38.800 --> 35:41.066
But a cold, hard fact

35:41.133 --> 35:44.166
is never as good
as the simple truth.

35:46.266 --> 35:48.100
Your husband...

35:48.166 --> 35:51.367
did he hurt you and your
children while he was addicted?

35:52.834 --> 35:55.233
- Yeah, he became a thief.

35:55.300 --> 35:57.133
- And now?

35:57.200 --> 36:01.900
- He struggled and he struggled
and he fought his cravings.

36:01.967 --> 36:04.734
With the help of Allah,
he is clean.

36:04.800 --> 36:06.066
- And your children?

36:06.133 --> 36:09.800
- They miss their father,
but they are blossoming.

36:09.867 --> 36:14.467
- Then, girl, that's the story
you ought to be telling.

36:14.533 --> 36:18.100
That's the stuff
people need to hear.

36:20.934 --> 36:22.333
- You're in a good mood today.

36:22.400 --> 36:23.800
- Yeah, man, my wife's
coming to see me.

36:23.867 --> 36:25.667
- All right, is she bringing
your children?

36:25.734 --> 36:28.934
- No, Sonsyrea and I need
some time, just the two of us.

36:29.900 --> 36:32.400
O'Reily.
That man is an animal.

36:33.900 --> 36:36.266
- He murdered Patrick Keenan
with such brutality,

36:36.333 --> 36:39.133
every time I see him I wonder
how he lives with himself.

36:40.400 --> 36:41.900
- How you doing,
Bismilla?

36:44.000 --> 36:46.300
Eat up, Arif, move it.

36:47.467 --> 36:49.467
Hey, take over here
for a second, okay?

36:49.533 --> 36:50.834
- Where the fuck
is you going, man?

36:52.600 --> 36:54.266
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

36:54.333 --> 36:55.567
- Hey, O'Reily, relax,
I haven't seen your brother

36:55.633 --> 36:57.800
since he checked out
of protective custody.

36:57.867 --> 36:59.033
We just catching up,
man, come on.

36:59.100 --> 37:00.233
- I don't want you
anywhere near him.

37:00.300 --> 37:02.300
- But, Ryan, I like Henry.

37:02.367 --> 37:03.934
- I told you,
this guy's a scumbag.

37:04.000 --> 37:06.333
- It takes one
to know one.

37:06.400 --> 37:07.834
- You on some kind of
a kamikaze mission there,

37:07.900 --> 37:09.066
Stanton, huh?

37:09.133 --> 37:10.333
If I see you talking
to Cyril again,

37:10.400 --> 37:12.133
you're going down
in flames.

37:15.567 --> 37:17.367
- Later.

37:18.600 --> 37:20.400
- What'd you say to him?

37:20.467 --> 37:22.400
- Nothing.

37:22.467 --> 37:25.300
Nothing. Jeez.

37:25.367 --> 37:26.667
- Hey, you mick fucks.

37:26.734 --> 37:29.967
We're working over here.
You want to join us?

37:34.767 --> 37:36.834
- You know, I agonized
and agonized over telling you

37:36.900 --> 37:40.133
I saw Ryan O'Reily
murder Patrick Keenan.

37:40.200 --> 37:42.500
But finally, minister Said
convinced me to step forward,

37:42.567 --> 37:45.000
and yet O'Reily's
never been charged.

37:45.066 --> 37:46.600
- That's because I haven't
been able to gather

37:46.667 --> 37:48.834
any concrete evidence
against him.

37:48.900 --> 37:51.667
At this point, all I have
is your testimony,

37:51.734 --> 37:53.400
and you won't even
speak publicly.

37:53.467 --> 37:56.000
Or have you
changed your mind?

37:56.066 --> 37:57.967
- If I do, O'Reily
will have me killed.

37:58.033 --> 37:59.767
- Well, don't expect miracles.

37:59.834 --> 38:02.266
- You know, I've been going over
and over that moment in my mind,

38:02.333 --> 38:03.967
trying to remember
every detail.

38:04.033 --> 38:05.467
And this might not be
important, I don't know,

38:05.533 --> 38:06.667
but I think I saw O'Reily

38:06.734 --> 38:09.133
pull a shamrock
off of Keenan's neck.

38:11.333 --> 38:12.367
- A shamrock?

38:12.433 --> 38:14.500
- Yeah, a gold shamrock
on a chain.

38:14.567 --> 38:15.734
- I see.

38:15.800 --> 38:17.266
- Don't let this slide, Warden.

38:17.333 --> 38:18.934
Justice must be done.

38:19.000 --> 38:21.033
O'Reily must be punished.

38:22.667 --> 38:24.500
- Uh-uh, stay back.

38:24.567 --> 38:25.834
- But I've got a pain.

38:25.900 --> 38:27.266
-  Where?

38:27.333 --> 38:28.533
- In my heart.

38:28.600 --> 38:30.266
I'm heartsick
'cause you keep ignoring me.

38:30.333 --> 38:32.467
- I'm busy, Ryan.

38:35.734 --> 38:38.033
- I just wanted to know,
did the medical board--

38:38.100 --> 38:40.834
did they rule on your case
for malpractice?

38:43.834 --> 38:45.633
- Yes.

38:45.700 --> 38:48.467
They reprimanded me,
fined me,

38:48.533 --> 38:51.266
but I'm still a doctor.

38:51.333 --> 38:54.033
- Well, that's--
that's great, right?

38:55.000 --> 38:56.700
- Gloria?

38:58.467 --> 38:59.567
May I see you?

38:59.633 --> 39:01.166
- Sure.

39:02.400 --> 39:03.934
- Let's walk.

39:10.400 --> 39:12.967
Whoever killed Patrick Keenan
took a gold chain

39:13.033 --> 39:15.400
from around his neck,
a shamrock.

39:15.467 --> 39:17.800
At one point, when we spoke,

39:17.867 --> 39:19.333
you had a shamrock
in your hand.

39:19.400 --> 39:20.967
- It was his.

39:21.033 --> 39:22.533
- Where'd you get it?

39:22.600 --> 39:26.500
- Arrived one day at my office
in an unmarked envelope.

39:26.567 --> 39:28.033
- When I interviewed you
about the murder,

39:28.100 --> 39:30.033
why didn't you tell me
you had evidence?

39:30.100 --> 39:32.233
- Leo...

39:32.300 --> 39:34.166
I was raped.

39:34.233 --> 39:35.266
After a trauma like that,

39:35.333 --> 39:37.967
you're not always
thinking clearly.

39:38.033 --> 39:39.166
There are things that I've done
since that night

39:39.233 --> 39:40.767
that make no sense.

39:42.600 --> 39:44.667
Just when I think I've got
my feelings under control,

39:44.734 --> 39:48.700
the slightest thing
sets me off.

39:48.767 --> 39:51.900
- I know, and I'm sorry.

39:51.967 --> 39:55.467
- Honestly, there's a part of me
that's happy Keenan's dead.

39:55.533 --> 39:57.400
I just want to put his face
behind me.

39:57.467 --> 39:58.433
- Of course.

39:58.500 --> 40:01.633
Um, Gloria...

40:03.033 --> 40:05.867
One last question,
and I promise,

40:05.934 --> 40:07.567
I'll never bring it up again.

40:08.767 --> 40:10.133
Where's the necklace?

40:11.900 --> 40:13.300
- Here.

40:14.900 --> 40:16.567
I threw the fucking
thing away.

40:22.367 --> 40:23.700
- Oh, come on, Warden.

40:23.767 --> 40:25.300
There's got to be a rule
about the number of times

40:25.367 --> 40:27.934
you can keep on asking me
these same questions.

40:28.000 --> 40:30.567
- Do you think I'm screwing
with your civil rights?

40:30.633 --> 40:33.033
You want to
consult an attorney?

40:33.100 --> 40:35.066
- I don't need an attorney,
'cause I didn't kill Keenan.

40:35.133 --> 40:37.934
Look, man, check
the assignment records.

40:38.000 --> 40:40.734
I wasn't near the gym all day.

40:40.800 --> 40:42.166
- My informant
says different.

40:42.233 --> 40:43.200
- Your informant's a liar.

40:43.266 --> 40:45.700
- Why would he lie?

40:45.767 --> 40:49.033
- Look, a lot of people
got issues with me.

40:49.100 --> 40:50.600
A lot of people
had issues with Keenan.

40:50.667 --> 40:53.266
That kid was a scrapper.
He was in fights all the time.

40:53.333 --> 40:54.834
You go through the files,

40:54.900 --> 40:56.433
you'll find a shitload
of suspects.

40:57.633 --> 40:59.734
- I have.

40:59.800 --> 41:02.367
You're still the nearest
and the dearest.

41:03.967 --> 41:05.233
Take him out.

41:11.433 --> 41:13.633
- Glynn really wants to nail you
for Keenan's murder, huh?

41:13.700 --> 41:15.600
- He's got some witness,
only I don't know who.

41:15.667 --> 41:17.166
If I could only find out
this fucker's name,

41:17.233 --> 41:19.367
then I could persuade him
to change his testimony or...

41:19.433 --> 41:20.900
- Kill him?

41:20.967 --> 41:24.266
- Yeah, well, in any case,
I need to confuse the situation.

41:24.333 --> 41:28.200
- Yeah, I know.

41:28.266 --> 41:29.633
- This clipping.

41:29.700 --> 41:31.834
It needs to find its way
into Henry Stanton's trunk,

41:31.900 --> 41:34.166
buried beneath
his underwear.

41:34.233 --> 41:37.000
- Meanwhile, what are you
gonna be doing?

41:37.066 --> 41:38.767
- Encouraging an entirely
different eyewitness

41:38.834 --> 41:40.300
to step forward.

41:42.400 --> 41:44.233
- Whoa!
- Go, go! Go, Marty, go!

41:44.300 --> 41:46.033
Go! Go!

41:46.100 --> 41:47.900
- Come on!
- Yeah, baby!

41:47.967 --> 41:49.166
- Out!

41:49.233 --> 41:50.800
- What the fuck are you
talking about?

41:50.867 --> 41:53.467
I was right--
- You are out!

42:02.200 --> 42:06.000
- Prisoner number 99M633,

42:06.066 --> 42:08.000
Martin Montgomery,

42:08.066 --> 42:11.066
convicted March 16, 1999,

42:11.133 --> 42:13.133
two counts of assault
in the first degree.

42:13.200 --> 42:17.600
Sentence, eight years,
up for parole...

42:17.667 --> 42:19.567
in five.

42:23.233 --> 42:25.700
- Hey, Marty, my boy.

42:25.767 --> 42:27.133
How about another piece
of cake?

42:27.200 --> 42:29.066
- Sure, thanks.

42:29.133 --> 42:30.934
O'Reily, right?
- That's right.

42:31.000 --> 42:32.633
- How come you're
offering me extra cake?

42:32.700 --> 42:34.266
I've been here
almost three years.

42:34.333 --> 42:36.166
You never even farted
in my direction.

42:36.233 --> 42:38.266
- Well, you're right.
We're not friends.

42:38.333 --> 42:39.367
Everybody knows
we're not friends,

42:39.433 --> 42:40.467
which is why I can offer you

42:40.533 --> 42:42.233
an exciting money-making
opportunity.

42:42.300 --> 42:43.467
- Which is what?

42:43.533 --> 42:45.667
- I want you to
go to the warden

42:45.734 --> 42:47.533
and tell him
you saw Henry Stanton

42:47.600 --> 42:48.633
murder Patrick Keenan.

42:48.700 --> 42:50.367
- But I didn't.

42:50.433 --> 42:53.633
- Marty, there's a lot more cake
where that came from.

42:56.533 --> 43:00.800
- Stanton caught Keenan with
the barbell right about here.

43:00.867 --> 43:02.333
Keenan went down.

43:02.400 --> 43:04.467
Stanton ripped the necklace
from his throat.

43:04.533 --> 43:05.934
- What happened next?

43:06.000 --> 43:07.567
- I ran, I mean--

43:07.633 --> 43:10.567
what, I'm gonna
stick around?

43:10.633 --> 43:11.967
- All right.

43:12.033 --> 43:13.600
Thanks for coming forward.

43:15.100 --> 43:17.166
- Like I said, my conscience
couldn't take the strain

43:17.233 --> 43:19.300
of keeping what I saw inside.

43:22.767 --> 43:25.033
- I'll be damned.

43:25.100 --> 43:26.467
Normally,
nobody rats on anybody.

43:26.533 --> 43:28.000
Now I got
two different witnesses

43:28.066 --> 43:30.734
identifying two different
suspects for the same murder.

43:30.800 --> 43:33.200
- Well, Montgomery had
a lot more details than Arif.

43:33.266 --> 43:34.800
Specific details.

43:34.867 --> 43:38.333
- Yeah, and according
to the records,

43:38.400 --> 43:40.633
Stanton and Keenan
were constantly fighting.

43:43.066 --> 43:44.600
But why would Arif lie?

43:44.667 --> 43:45.934
- Ask him.

43:46.000 --> 43:47.633
- No.

43:47.700 --> 43:49.900
First I'm gonna have a word
with Henry Stanton.

43:53.367 --> 43:54.533
- Me?

43:54.600 --> 43:56.166
Kill Patrick Keenan?

43:56.233 --> 43:58.066
I wish.

43:58.133 --> 44:00.200
- At least twice
in Unit B,

44:00.266 --> 44:02.233
Keenan kicked the shit
out of you.

44:02.300 --> 44:05.033
- That ain't true.
I got my licks in.

44:05.100 --> 44:07.200
- Medical report...

44:07.266 --> 44:10.133
says after the first fight,
you had two broken ribs.

44:10.200 --> 44:12.367
The second one,
a broken wrist.

44:12.433 --> 44:15.333
Keenan had
no injuries at all.

44:15.400 --> 44:17.500
- Mine was a moral victory.

44:19.100 --> 44:20.834
- That day in the gym,

44:20.900 --> 44:22.433
you whacked him,
didn't you, Stanton?

44:22.500 --> 44:24.667
- No.

44:24.734 --> 44:27.233
I swear on my children, no.

44:29.600 --> 44:31.100
- We found this in your cell.

44:31.166 --> 44:34.233
- I've never even
seen this before.

44:34.300 --> 44:36.200
- You're obsessed
with Dr. Nathan, aren't you?

44:36.266 --> 44:37.800
- No.

44:37.867 --> 44:39.967
I mean, she's got nice tits
and all,

44:40.033 --> 44:41.266
but other than that,
I never even--

44:41.333 --> 44:42.433
- Take him to the Hole.

44:42.500 --> 44:43.767
- The Hole, why?

44:43.834 --> 44:46.667
- Maybe a few days there
will jostle your membrane.

44:46.734 --> 44:47.667
- Fuck you!

44:47.734 --> 44:48.800
Fuck you!

44:51.300 --> 44:52.233
Fuck you!

44:52.300 --> 44:54.400
Fuck you, you motherfuck!

44:56.600 --> 44:59.266
- Warden, how's
the investigation going?

44:59.333 --> 45:00.834
- Fine.

45:00.900 --> 45:03.633
- When are you
gonna charge O'Reily?

45:03.700 --> 45:05.433
- Let me ask you
something, Arif.

45:05.500 --> 45:09.100
Why are you so hell-bent
on Ryan O'Reily going down?

45:09.166 --> 45:11.734
- As I said,
justice must be done.

45:11.800 --> 45:13.433
- Mm-hmm, there's
no other reason?

45:13.500 --> 45:15.834
No other agenda?
- No.

45:15.900 --> 45:18.233
- As in payback for some wrong
done to you?

45:18.300 --> 45:20.433
- No.

45:20.500 --> 45:21.900
- I've been digging around.

45:21.967 --> 45:23.300
During the riots,
you and O'Reily

45:23.367 --> 45:24.767
almost came to blows.

45:24.834 --> 45:26.567
- The riot?

45:26.633 --> 45:27.934
That was five years ago.

45:28.000 --> 45:31.934
- In my experience,
cons have long memories.

45:32.000 --> 45:34.567
- You think I made
this story up?

45:34.633 --> 45:35.667
- You know what?

45:35.734 --> 45:37.800
At this point,
I don't know.

45:37.867 --> 45:40.533
And I'm beginning to wonder
if I even care.

45:50.233 --> 45:51.400
- Ready for this?

45:51.467 --> 45:53.066
Glynn suspended
the investigation

45:53.133 --> 45:54.500
into the murder
of Patrick Keenan.

45:54.567 --> 45:56.567
Too many suspects,
not enough clues.

45:56.633 --> 45:57.600
- Perfect.

45:57.667 --> 45:59.066
- Bet you could press it.

45:59.133 --> 46:00.800
Bet you could get
Stanton convicted.

46:00.867 --> 46:01.800
- Don't want to.

46:01.867 --> 46:03.033
- Why?

46:03.100 --> 46:04.567
- Look.

46:04.633 --> 46:06.266
Henry Stanton gets
the death penalty

46:06.333 --> 46:08.066
for Keenan's murder?

46:08.133 --> 46:10.200
Gloria Nathan's not gonna let
an innocent man die.

46:10.266 --> 46:12.967
She's gonna feel compelled
to tell the truth.

46:13.033 --> 46:16.433
No, I win
by keeping the ball in play,

46:16.500 --> 46:18.433
by keeping the facts murky.

46:20.967 --> 46:22.967
Have that placed
in Marty Montgomery's cell.

46:23.033 --> 46:24.133
- Montgomery?

46:24.200 --> 46:26.166
Why Montgomery?
- Life insurance.

46:29.467 --> 46:32.567
- Ryan, can I tell Henry
our secret?

46:32.633 --> 46:34.033
That we fooled
the warden?

46:34.100 --> 46:35.433
- No, Cyril,
for Chrissake,

46:35.500 --> 46:37.533
don't say a fucking word
to him!

46:38.767 --> 46:41.000
- Stop yelling.

46:41.066 --> 46:43.100
Why do you always yell?

46:43.166 --> 46:44.500
Like Papa.

46:48.533 --> 46:50.266
- Fuck off.

46:52.066 --> 46:54.166
- Galileo Galilei
challenged the principle

46:54.233 --> 46:56.633
that had been accepted
for over 1,000 years,

46:56.700 --> 46:59.033
that the Earth was
the center of the universe,

46:59.100 --> 47:01.734
that everything
revolved around us.

47:01.800 --> 47:04.900
The mad monks in the Inquisition
imprisoned Galileo

47:04.967 --> 47:09.433
and ordered him to repudiate
his theory, which he did.

47:09.500 --> 47:11.700
How much worse of a punishment
is there than being forced

47:11.767 --> 47:14.500
to publicly deny
your deepest beliefs,

47:14.567 --> 47:17.767
to say that what
you know to be true...

47:19.900 --> 47:21.533
Is a lie?

47:39.033 --> 47:40.633
- I see that baby over there

47:40.700 --> 47:43.033
and I can't help but think
about Augustus

47:43.100 --> 47:44.767
when he was just born,

47:44.834 --> 47:47.233
when he took his first step.

47:49.066 --> 47:51.633
You know, you think back
and say, "If I had done this",

47:51.700 --> 47:53.700
or, "If that hadn't happened",

47:53.767 --> 47:55.967
his whole life
might have been different.

47:56.033 --> 47:58.834
- Allah guides our every step.

47:58.900 --> 48:00.266
- I know.

48:00.333 --> 48:03.367
God is my rock,
but he can't stop

48:03.433 --> 48:05.233
the thoughts
from flooding my head,

48:05.300 --> 48:08.867
the memories from flowing.

48:08.934 --> 48:11.033
Augustus' first suit,

48:11.100 --> 48:13.200
his first day of school.

48:14.500 --> 48:16.433
Oh, his wedding day!

48:16.500 --> 48:18.734
He looked so happy.

48:18.800 --> 48:20.567
He and Annabella both did.

48:20.633 --> 48:22.867
The sun was
shining so bright,

48:22.934 --> 48:26.467
I had to squint my eyes
as they drove away.

48:26.533 --> 48:28.467
And now...

48:28.533 --> 48:31.166
I feel like I lost him
that day,

48:31.233 --> 48:32.867
in more ways than one.

48:34.734 --> 48:38.467
His--his world got narrower,
you know?

48:38.533 --> 48:40.600
With the drugs and all.

48:40.667 --> 48:42.567
- Is he still using?

48:42.633 --> 48:45.266
- Oh, no, thank God.

48:45.333 --> 48:48.567
My boy's been clean
over three years.

48:48.633 --> 48:50.433
I'm very proud of him
for that.

48:50.500 --> 48:52.200
- Yes, indeed.

48:53.433 --> 48:55.500
- And that's why I'm worried.

48:57.233 --> 48:59.700
That's why today
is gonna be so hard.

48:59.767 --> 49:01.367
I...

49:02.433 --> 49:04.867
I've got news
to tell him,

49:04.934 --> 49:07.300
bad news,

49:07.367 --> 49:09.800
news that I want him
to hear from me first,

49:09.867 --> 49:13.567
because maybe if I can just
cushion the blow,

49:13.633 --> 49:16.600
he--he won't go back
to the crack.

49:19.633 --> 49:22.967
His wife, Annabella--

49:23.033 --> 49:24.934
she's divorcing him.

49:25.000 --> 49:27.400
- Oh, my.

49:30.633 --> 49:33.433
- I tried talking
to the girl, but...

49:35.633 --> 49:37.767
Her mind's made up.

49:37.834 --> 49:41.233
She's got another fella, and...

49:41.300 --> 49:42.934
she wants to be free.

49:45.033 --> 49:47.800
And yet,

49:47.867 --> 49:49.633
God help me, I...

49:49.700 --> 49:51.934
I can't stop blaming her,

49:52.000 --> 49:57.400
for the darkness
in Augustus' life.

49:57.467 --> 49:59.567
She was with him...

50:00.834 --> 50:03.834
The night he shot
the policeman,

50:03.900 --> 50:07.600
the night his spine
got snapped.

50:10.367 --> 50:13.633
She should've taken
better care of my son.

50:19.533 --> 50:20.834
- Eugenia?

50:22.734 --> 50:25.333
Oh, I'm fine.

50:27.467 --> 50:29.500
I'm fine.

50:29.567 --> 50:31.266
I'm fine.

50:31.333 --> 50:34.633
The tears are for Augustus,
my little emperor.

50:38.934 --> 50:43.333
Locked in a cell
down in that wretched place.

50:45.567 --> 50:48.133
Half his body dead.

50:52.800 --> 50:54.667
And damn...

50:58.300 --> 51:01.200
All I keep thinking of

51:01.266 --> 51:03.400
is his first step.

51:07.133 --> 51:10.100
- Yo, Burr, how come you
don't never get in line?

51:11.700 --> 51:13.166
- 'Cause ain't nobody
sending me nothing.

51:13.233 --> 51:14.734
- You see this?

51:14.800 --> 51:16.934
Motherfuckers want me
to donate money

51:17.000 --> 51:20.233
to the United
Negro College Fund.

51:20.300 --> 51:22.200
They got to be kidding.

51:24.967 --> 51:26.734
- Fuck.

51:28.400 --> 51:31.500
It's a letter
from some lawyer.

51:31.567 --> 51:33.900
My wife's divorcing me.

51:33.967 --> 51:37.166
- Uh, is this a surprise?

51:37.233 --> 51:38.967
- No, I guess not.

51:39.033 --> 51:40.867
I mean--no, no.

51:40.934 --> 51:42.767
I mean, she--

51:42.834 --> 51:44.834
she been visiting me
less and less, you know.

51:44.900 --> 51:48.400
When she does come, there's...

51:48.467 --> 51:50.066
definitely a distance.

51:50.133 --> 51:52.000
- Well, what
do you expect?

51:52.066 --> 51:55.567
- You been cooped up here
in Oz for the last seven years.

51:55.633 --> 51:56.934
That's a long time

51:57.000 --> 51:58.567
for a young gal
to keep a candle lit.

51:58.633 --> 51:59.867
- I know.

51:59.934 --> 52:02.100
It's just that--

52:02.166 --> 52:04.700
you know,
we loved each other.

52:04.767 --> 52:05.767
The least Annabella
could've done

52:05.834 --> 52:07.734
was come and said good-bye.

52:07.800 --> 52:09.166
- It's tough luck,
Augustus.

52:09.233 --> 52:11.533
Man, it's tough
fucking luck.

52:13.300 --> 52:16.400
- You'll survive, son.

52:16.467 --> 52:17.834
You survived this shithole.

52:17.900 --> 52:20.033
You'll survive a divorce.

52:21.266 --> 52:22.900
- Maybe.

52:25.867 --> 52:29.800
It's like, losing her, it's--

52:29.867 --> 52:32.000
it's like giving up
my last piece of hope.

52:33.767 --> 52:35.133
It's like admitting
to myself

52:35.200 --> 52:38.667
that everything
I had out there is gone.

52:39.934 --> 52:42.033
It's gone forever.

52:45.567 --> 52:48.333
- You know, I never
told you this, but...

52:48.400 --> 52:51.100
Dee and I was fixing
to divorce too.

52:51.166 --> 52:53.600
- What?
- Just before she got sick.

52:55.333 --> 52:57.767
Course, after she got sick,
I couldn't leave her then.

52:57.834 --> 53:00.233
- But I thought you and Dee
was happy.

53:00.300 --> 53:01.834
You always seemed so happy.

53:01.900 --> 53:04.433
- That was the vodka.

53:04.500 --> 53:08.233
Only woman I knew that could
drink more liquor than me.

53:08.300 --> 53:13.100
That love in her eyes was
always a little bit blurry.

53:13.166 --> 53:14.233
No, you and your moms

53:14.300 --> 53:15.900
was the only real family
I ever knew.

53:17.734 --> 53:19.233
- She's coming today.

53:20.667 --> 53:23.367
- Eugenia.

53:23.433 --> 53:25.633
- Maybe you and me
could visit Mom together.

53:31.633 --> 53:33.400
- You know,
I'd like that.

53:35.934 --> 53:38.066
I'd like to see Eugenia.

53:41.433 --> 53:44.433
She always had
the sweetest pair of eyes.

54:02.667 --> 54:05.100
- Okay, it looks like we're
gonna be at the main gate

54:05.166 --> 54:07.367
of Oswald
in about five minutes.

55:06.500 --> 55:09.400
Sonsyrea Arif,

55:09.467 --> 55:11.500
Charles Balis,

55:11.567 --> 55:13.667
Eugenia Hill...

55:15.133 --> 55:17.266
Sandy Laitman,

55:17.333 --> 55:19.633
Annette Osorio,

55:19.700 --> 55:22.033
Shirin Patel,

55:22.100 --> 55:24.066
Joanie Ranzer,

55:24.133 --> 55:26.233
Carrie Schillinger.

55:26.300 --> 55:28.667
- What about my granddaughter?

55:28.734 --> 55:30.767
Jewel Schillinger?

55:30.834 --> 55:32.000
- She's at Benchley Memorial.

55:32.066 --> 55:33.200
She's in stable condition.

55:34.967 --> 55:36.633
David Swanson...

55:38.667 --> 55:40.100
Pamela Turton...

55:41.567 --> 55:43.467
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

55:43.533 --> 55:45.266
Lots of fine people
have sat,

55:45.333 --> 55:47.967
staring at the inside
of prison walls,

55:48.033 --> 55:50.734
Socrates, Gandhi,
Joan of Arc,

55:50.800 --> 55:54.233
even our Lord,
Jesus Christ.

55:54.300 --> 55:56.200
He spent the last night
of his life

55:56.266 --> 55:58.734
not with holy men,
but with scum,

55:58.800 --> 56:01.100
like the kind
we got in Oz.

56:01.166 --> 56:03.100
One of the last things
Jesus did on Earth

56:03.166 --> 56:07.100
was invite a prisoner
to join him in heaven.

56:08.834 --> 56:11.433
He loved that criminal.

56:11.500 --> 56:16.667
I say he loved that criminal
as much as he loved anyone.

56:16.734 --> 56:18.800
Jesus knew in his heart,

56:18.867 --> 56:20.967
it takes a lot
to love a sinner.

56:21.033 --> 56:24.066
But the sinner...

56:24.133 --> 56:25.700
he needs it all the more.
