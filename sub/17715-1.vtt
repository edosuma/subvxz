00:51.152 --> 00:53.252
<i>Good morning, Tracy. Still busy</i>
<i> southbound on the Hollywood.</i>

00:53.254 --> 00:57.423
<i> It'll be a struggle from</i>
<i>Hollywood blvd toward alvarado.</i>

00:57.425 --> 01:00.793
<i> But overall, I think you'll</i>
<i>enjoy this Monday morning ride.</i>

01:34.361 --> 01:36.128
Oh, man.

01:38.565 --> 01:39.631
Ah, shit!

01:47.107 --> 01:50.509
Oh, shit, my fucking keys.
Oh, fuck!

01:55.582 --> 01:57.749
Yes. I'd like to thank you
for your order.

01:57.751 --> 01:59.518
You should receive your
<i> groom your Booty</i>

01:59.520 --> 02:02.488
limited edition workout videos
in two to three weeks.

02:02.490 --> 02:04.456
Yes. Okay.

02:05.492 --> 02:08.660
Hey. How are the calls today?

02:08.662 --> 02:11.430
I got the Booty calls,
you got the tech support.

02:11.432 --> 02:15.634
Your stereotypical rubbish
handed down by your bourgeoisie.

02:16.769 --> 02:19.738
Think she saw me
come in late?

02:19.740 --> 02:23.609
She definitely didn't see you
come in on time, drew.

02:23.611 --> 02:24.843
Thank you for calling
vantage light bulb.

02:24.845 --> 02:26.745
How may I brighten up your day?

02:26.747 --> 02:28.714
Start by telling me why I've
got an entire Christmas tree

02:28.716 --> 02:30.516
that won't light up.

02:30.518 --> 02:32.718
<i> Who makes light bulbs</i>
<i> that don't light up?</i>

02:32.720 --> 02:34.353
Sir, I don't actually
make the lights.

02:34.355 --> 02:36.488
I just try to provide a solution
for your problem.

02:36.490 --> 02:38.423
Now, are your lights
properly plugged in?

02:38.425 --> 02:40.893
Young man, I am a retired
electrical engineer

02:40.895 --> 02:42.628
<i> with the United States</i>
<i> military.</i>

02:42.630 --> 02:43.862
Yes, and thank you for that.

02:43.864 --> 02:45.731
So your lights
are properly plugged

02:45.733 --> 02:47.232
into an electrical outlet?

02:47.234 --> 02:48.734
Oh!

02:48.736 --> 02:51.203
An electrical outlet!

02:51.205 --> 02:53.405
<i> Thank you, Benjamin Franklin!</i>

02:53.407 --> 02:56.275
All this time, I had them
plugged into my dog's ass!

02:56.277 --> 02:59.178
<i> Get me a supervisor,</i>
<i> you idiot!</i>

03:01.347 --> 03:03.348
Do you read the news, drew?

03:03.350 --> 03:04.883
Sometimes.

03:04.885 --> 03:06.652
How about the wall street parts?

03:06.654 --> 03:08.387
On occasion.

03:08.389 --> 03:10.689
I don't think you do
because if you did,

03:10.691 --> 03:13.959
you'd realize that this country
is in a financial crisis.

03:13.961 --> 03:18.230
It's on the brink of a national
economical depression.

03:18.232 --> 03:20.766
It's gotten so bad
that only one in twelve people

03:20.768 --> 03:22.301
are gainfully employed.

03:22.303 --> 03:24.670
Gainfully?

03:24.672 --> 03:28.840
I would think that
the lucky few who have jobs

03:28.842 --> 03:32.211
would be bending over
with gratitude.

03:32.213 --> 03:33.979
- I--
- uh--

03:35.515 --> 03:37.916
are you bending, drew?

03:37.918 --> 03:40.786
I try and bend.

03:40.788 --> 03:43.855
Well, I don't see any bending.

03:44.858 --> 03:46.225
With a, uh,

03:46.227 --> 03:49.461
oh, a 49% call rating,

03:49.463 --> 03:51.496
I'm gonna go
with no bending.

03:51.498 --> 03:53.532
I'll try to bend more.

03:53.534 --> 03:55.667
Oh, you will bend, drew.

03:55.669 --> 03:57.903
All eight hours
of every shift,

03:57.905 --> 04:02.407
you will bend over
and take everything I give you.

04:04.477 --> 04:07.012
Think of a... oh!

04:07.014 --> 04:09.781
Think of a happy
little giraffe.

04:09.783 --> 04:11.550
Ooh, ooh! He's running.

04:11.552 --> 04:13.252
He's running through
a field in Africa.

04:13.254 --> 04:14.586
Oh, oh, oh!

04:14.588 --> 04:16.555
He sees a tree with some leaves.

04:18.858 --> 04:21.326
Mmm! Oh, he's eating them.

04:21.327 --> 04:24.463
Aah! He's eating the leaves,
but it's not leaves, drew!

04:24.465 --> 04:25.731
It's your asshole!

04:45.018 --> 04:48.387
Get back out there!
Put the headset on your ears.

04:48.389 --> 04:51.590
Act like you give a damn
about your job!

05:26.659 --> 05:28.960
Where did you get this?

05:28.962 --> 05:31.363
They're all over the Internet.

05:31.365 --> 05:32.698
This isn't me, ebony.

05:32.700 --> 05:34.466
Oh! That's not you?

05:34.468 --> 05:36.868
That's my face,
not my body.

05:36.870 --> 05:38.904
So do you have a twin sister
that you never mention?

05:38.906 --> 05:41.440
Zip it, Hugo!

05:41.442 --> 05:42.774
Zipping.

05:42.776 --> 05:45.844
Human resources is investigating
as we speak.

05:45.846 --> 05:47.979
Human resources? I don't have
time to talk about this.

05:47.981 --> 05:49.681
I gotta go pre-board.

05:49.683 --> 05:51.583
You are not going anywhere.
They have grounded you

05:51.585 --> 05:53.752
until the investigation
has wrapped.

05:53.754 --> 05:55.454
This is my job.

05:55.456 --> 05:56.822
Nikki, I've got direct orders.

05:56.824 --> 05:58.924
You are suspended indefinitely
without pay.

05:58.926 --> 06:00.759
Now, I need your wings.

06:00.761 --> 06:01.960
Clipped.

06:03.763 --> 06:07.866
You obviously do not need these,
fairy boy.

06:07.868 --> 06:10.102
At least I have wings.

06:11.738 --> 06:13.739
Every day I feel like
I'm in prison in there.

06:13.741 --> 06:16.375
Yeah, but prison is prison
'cause you don't get a break.

06:16.377 --> 06:17.642
- It's a metaphor.
- You mean an analogy?

06:17.644 --> 06:18.944
I mean I hate my job.

06:18.946 --> 06:21.380
Lots of people
hate their job, man.

06:21.382 --> 06:22.681
And my roommate.

06:22.683 --> 06:24.549
Roommates are roommates, dog.

06:24.551 --> 06:27.986
You think it helps me to echo
what I say after I said it?

06:27.988 --> 06:30.956
Echo? These are
words of affirmation.

06:30.958 --> 06:33.125
I'm trying to help you
enjoy life, brother. Relax.

06:33.127 --> 06:35.060
Life? This is not a life.

06:35.062 --> 06:37.796
I live in a one-bedroom
apartment with a caveman.

06:37.798 --> 06:39.564
I failed the bar
for the second time now,

06:39.566 --> 06:41.500
which means I gotta keep working
at the call center,

06:41.502 --> 06:45.637
where Kathy wants to shove
a giraffe into my ass.

06:47.006 --> 06:49.641
Damn. That does sound
like prison.

06:50.743 --> 06:52.444
You might think it's funny,

06:52.446 --> 06:54.646
but the civil rights movement
is no joke, drew.

06:54.648 --> 06:56.815
We have a black president.
What more do you want?

06:56.817 --> 06:59.985
I want my forty acres and my
fucking mule. How about that?

06:59.987 --> 07:01.586
Oh, my--

07:01.588 --> 07:04.189
what the fuck are you doing?

07:04.191 --> 07:05.857
- Perv!
- Oh, my god.

07:05.859 --> 07:07.526
- Hey!
- Fuck is his problem?

07:07.528 --> 07:09.961
- Hey, are you okay?
- I think so.

07:09.963 --> 07:11.930
What the hell was that?
Did you see him?

07:11.932 --> 07:13.999
Yeah. He just pulled
his penis out.

07:14.001 --> 07:16.568
Why didn't you do anything?

07:16.570 --> 07:18.603
Well, it happened really fast.

07:18.605 --> 07:21.106
Yes, hi. I need an officer.
I was just--

07:21.108 --> 07:23.074
I don't know.
I was humped.

07:23.076 --> 07:24.876
I'm not sticking around
to hear that shit, man.

07:24.878 --> 07:28.146
African-Americans do not
fare well at crime scenes.

07:28.148 --> 07:29.981
- Nate, you're overeating.
- No, I'm not.

07:29.983 --> 07:31.650
Yes, he had a black face.

07:31.652 --> 07:33.585
Mask, okay? He had a mask.

07:33.587 --> 07:35.020
Not face.

07:35.022 --> 07:37.656
Get that shit right.

07:48.701 --> 07:51.002
Somebody report a hump and run?

07:51.004 --> 07:52.571
Yes, officer, I did.

07:52.573 --> 07:54.606
Is this the black face
that dry humped you?

07:54.608 --> 07:56.975
- No, no, no.
- No, he's gone.

07:56.977 --> 07:59.177
Put your hands in front of the
vehicle, where I can see 'em.

07:59.179 --> 08:01.613
- What'd I do, officer?
- Or you will be tased.

08:01.615 --> 08:03.515
This is racist, man.

08:03.517 --> 08:05.183
He didn't do anything, officer.

08:05.185 --> 08:07.652
- Who are you, sir?
- My name is drew Thomas.

08:07.654 --> 08:09.821
Fantastic.
I'm officer who-gives-a-shit.

08:09.823 --> 08:11.890
- What are you doing here?
- He's a witness.

08:11.892 --> 08:15.093
- Oh, so you saw everything.
- I was standing right here.

08:15.095 --> 08:17.229
And while the serial humper
was just hammering away,

08:17.231 --> 08:19.564
you continued
to just stand there?

08:19.566 --> 08:22.033
It happened really fast.

08:26.105 --> 08:29.074
Okay, Nancy,

08:29.076 --> 08:31.776
how about we start out with
a thorough physical description.

08:31.778 --> 08:33.745
Well, I couldn't really
see his face.

08:33.746 --> 08:37.115
Couldn't see? Because you didn't
have your contact lenses in?

08:37.116 --> 08:39.818
No. I don't wear
contact lenses.

08:39.820 --> 08:41.820
Because they irritate your eyes?

08:41.822 --> 08:43.889
No, I don't need them.

08:51.898 --> 08:53.698
You just hold on right there.
We're not done yet.

08:55.101 --> 08:57.102
How many fingers
am I holding up?

08:57.104 --> 08:59.170
One.

08:59.172 --> 09:02.107
One and three halves.
That equals two and a half.

09:02.109 --> 09:04.175
I'm afraid
you do need visual aids.

09:04.177 --> 09:07.078
I didn't think
half fingers counted.

09:07.080 --> 09:08.680
Just like you didn't think
a physical description

09:08.682 --> 09:10.582
would be necessary
to apprehend the criminal.

09:10.584 --> 09:13.184
Hey, officers,
this is about me.

09:13.186 --> 09:15.186
So while this citizen
was happily complacent,

09:15.188 --> 09:17.122
were you able
to secure any details?

09:17.124 --> 09:19.024
Yes, and I already told you
he had a black face.

09:19.026 --> 09:20.559
Mask, goddamn it!

09:20.561 --> 09:22.961
- Hey, you shut your mouth!
- It was a mask.

09:22.963 --> 09:24.896
You wanna get tased?
Just get the hell out of here.

09:24.898 --> 09:27.899
Thank you, officer.

09:27.901 --> 09:31.136
You know what?
My work is done here.

09:31.138 --> 09:34.306
To make it official, ma'am,
please fill out that form

09:34.308 --> 09:36.074
and mail it
to the address below.

09:36.076 --> 09:39.210
That's it? She just mails it
and then just waits?

09:39.212 --> 09:41.079
Affirmative.
Or you can do it for her

09:41.081 --> 09:43.214
if you're not just
still standing here.

09:53.993 --> 09:55.660
Really?

09:55.662 --> 09:58.663
Hope you have a better
rest of your day, ma'am.

09:58.665 --> 09:59.698
Ready, rookie?

10:04.171 --> 10:07.038
I get fired for naked pictures
and humped by a dog in a mask.

10:07.040 --> 10:08.306
That's normal, right?

10:08.308 --> 10:10.008
Naked pictures?

10:10.010 --> 10:12.711
Now I'm late for class.
Just keeps getting better.

10:12.713 --> 10:14.779
For the naked pictures or...

10:14.781 --> 10:17.148
You know what? Forget about it.
Forget about this too.

10:17.150 --> 10:19.985
Really? I could fill this out
for you and totally call you.

10:19.987 --> 10:23.154
No. Just pretend you got good
Karma coming your way, right?

10:24.323 --> 10:25.857
Right.

10:32.198 --> 10:35.266
"Evan polus.
Starmaker academy."

10:37.670 --> 10:40.405
<i> Evan, hi! This is Sara!</i>
<i> I did it!</i>

10:40.407 --> 10:42.340
<i> I walked in the room</i>
<i> and killed it.</i>

10:42.342 --> 10:44.876
<i> See ya soon, or should I say,</i>
<i> "you'll see me soon."</i>

10:44.878 --> 10:47.746
<i> Evan, Mr. polus, it's al.</i>

10:47.748 --> 10:51.783
<i>I just had my final callback on</i>
<i>that boxing film. They want me!</i>

10:51.785 --> 10:55.053
<i> I used all your techniques,</i>
<i> and I killed. You're a genius.</i>

10:55.055 --> 10:57.355
<i> I'm gonna blow this town away.</i>
<i> Whoo!</i>

10:59.126 --> 11:01.159
<i> Darren Hughes here</i>
<i> from Mulholland productions.</i>

11:01.161 --> 11:03.928
<i> Just had two more of your</i>
<i> people drop by my office.</i>

11:03.930 --> 11:06.765
<i> Listen, I haven't seen talent</i>
<i> like that since,</i>

11:06.767 --> 11:09.901
<i> well, let's be honest, ever.</i>

11:09.903 --> 11:14.439
See, if I had a beer for
every one of these messages,

11:14.441 --> 11:16.441
this entire room
would be foaming

11:16.443 --> 11:18.843
in the suds of drunkenness.

11:18.845 --> 11:26.317
Now, you people sit here longing
to be intoxicated by stardom.

11:26.319 --> 11:28.019
How the hell are you
gonna make it

11:28.021 --> 11:29.921
like these people
on my machine?

11:29.923 --> 11:34.092
Well, folks, it's simple.

11:34.094 --> 11:38.763
You're gonna do exactly
what I tell you to do.

11:38.765 --> 11:42.133
Now, you want to get smart and
do your own thing, all right.

11:42.135 --> 11:45.236
But please, don't come
running back to daddy

11:45.238 --> 11:47.238
after you've been
chewed up and spat out

11:47.240 --> 11:49.140
onto the urine-filled streets.

11:49.142 --> 11:51.943
I'm the only person
in this town

11:51.945 --> 11:54.412
who can take you
right to the top, baby.

11:54.414 --> 11:57.282
Now, the sooner you realize
how lucky you are

11:57.284 --> 11:59.818
to be here under my tutelage,

11:59.820 --> 12:03.421
the sooner you people
will be shining brighter

12:03.423 --> 12:07.092
than the big fucking Dipper.

12:07.094 --> 12:08.827
So...

12:08.829 --> 12:11.396
Watch out, NASA.

12:11.398 --> 12:15.767
It's time to discover
some new stars.

12:17.737 --> 12:20.438
That little Daisy Duke outfit
got me going.

12:20.440 --> 12:24.342
Damn, if I were you, I'd get
ahold of that ass quick.

12:24.344 --> 12:27.045
That's amazing advice,
as per usual.

12:27.047 --> 12:29.748
Without her job,
she's gonna need a new pilot.

12:29.750 --> 12:32.951
I could be your copilot, drew.

12:32.953 --> 12:35.920
We can fly her into some
international territory.

12:35.922 --> 12:37.789
What does that even mean?

12:37.791 --> 12:39.324
This is your copilot
checking in.

12:39.326 --> 12:41.025
We're clear for takeoff.

12:41.027 --> 12:44.362
Expect a bouncy ride
with hella turbulence, you know?

12:49.035 --> 12:50.201
Just like that.

12:50.203 --> 12:52.537
You are sick.

12:52.539 --> 12:54.773
Tell me again why you didn't
get her number?

12:54.775 --> 12:57.175
Oh, I know exactly
where to find her.

12:59.912 --> 13:02.113
Why did you leave me here
so soon, Michael?

13:02.115 --> 13:04.949
You're my best friend.

13:04.951 --> 13:06.885
You're my best friend.

13:06.887 --> 13:08.453
You're my best friend.

13:11.857 --> 13:13.124
You're my best friend,
Michael.

13:13.126 --> 13:15.026
Jesus!

13:15.028 --> 13:16.795
Dude, what?

13:18.097 --> 13:20.932
Who is Michael?

13:20.934 --> 13:22.200
Apparently an overdose victim.

13:22.202 --> 13:24.969
He was your best friend.

13:24.971 --> 13:26.337
No.

13:26.339 --> 13:28.439
It's from a monologue.

13:28.441 --> 13:29.974
Do you knock?

13:29.976 --> 13:32.343
Who's that man
in the mirror?

13:32.345 --> 13:33.978
What?

13:33.980 --> 13:37.015
That man in the mirror
is you, drew.

13:37.017 --> 13:39.284
He's your best friend
now that Michael has passed.

13:39.286 --> 13:41.886
He's always there.

13:41.888 --> 13:46.090
And sometimes
he is all you have.

13:48.127 --> 13:50.862
Thank you for that, hansel.

13:50.864 --> 13:53.598
Can you please
shut my door now?

14:24.230 --> 14:27.031
no. No, I don't think
you get it, Hugo.

14:27.033 --> 14:29.000
I need something different.

14:29.002 --> 14:31.269
Something strange.

14:34.006 --> 14:35.173
What are you laughing at?

14:35.175 --> 14:37.275
No, I'm not.

14:37.277 --> 14:38.877
Wanna open the door?

14:38.879 --> 14:40.245
Okay.

14:42.448 --> 14:44.115
Here you go.

14:45.484 --> 14:47.118
Close it.

14:47.120 --> 14:48.953
Close it!

14:52.358 --> 14:54.259
Oh, my god!
Get off of me!

14:54.261 --> 14:55.493
You like this?

14:55.495 --> 14:57.195
Get off of me!
Get the fuck off me!

14:57.197 --> 14:58.997
I can hold you
all day, woman.

14:58.999 --> 15:00.331
Let me go!

15:00.333 --> 15:02.367
Get the fuck off me,
you big bitch!

15:02.369 --> 15:04.269
- Stop!
- What are you doing?

15:04.271 --> 15:06.571
Drew? Oh, my god!

15:06.573 --> 15:08.006
Dammit, dammit, dammit!

15:08.008 --> 15:09.908
No, babe, you got this,
you got this.

15:09.910 --> 15:12.543
Stay in the moment, Nikki.
Keep it. Use it!

15:12.545 --> 15:15.246
I think I'm still warm.
I think I'm still warm.

15:15.248 --> 15:16.915
Yeah. I'm gonna go
unleash the beast.

15:16.917 --> 15:18.950
Oh, fuck yeah, bitch.
Blow 'em away, baby.

15:18.952 --> 15:22.186
- Here it comes!
- Blow 'em away, baby!

15:22.188 --> 15:23.955
Yeah!

15:25.257 --> 15:27.425
I was warming her up,
you idiot.

15:27.427 --> 15:29.560
Newbie class is that way.

15:31.563 --> 15:34.332
You'll never be a star.

15:34.334 --> 15:35.500
Cocksucker!

16:19.545 --> 16:22.146
Good evening!

16:22.148 --> 16:24.649
And welcome
to the world famous

16:24.651 --> 16:31.356
starmaker academy!

16:32.992 --> 16:37.762
Brace yourselves
for your group numbers.

16:37.764 --> 16:39.564
1, 2, 3, 4.

16:39.566 --> 16:42.033
1, 2, 3, 4.

16:42.035 --> 16:43.334
1, 2, 3--

16:43.336 --> 16:45.636
uh, shh...

16:48.407 --> 16:50.608
Tonight you'll be stripped

16:50.610 --> 16:53.611
to the barest
of your vulnerable bones.

16:53.613 --> 16:57.749
Studies have found that most
people would rather not live

16:57.751 --> 17:02.453
than speak in front
of a live audience.

17:02.455 --> 17:06.391
Well, you are the brave.

17:06.393 --> 17:10.294
Que se dice, my brotha?

17:10.296 --> 17:11.695
What...

17:11.698 --> 17:14.464
That's Italian for hello.

17:14.467 --> 17:16.334
Sei de ce CIA dito!

17:16.336 --> 17:18.136
Move.

17:18.137 --> 17:23.141
That's Italian for "you're late!
Sit down, please!"

17:23.143 --> 17:25.209
What?

17:25.211 --> 17:26.743
As I was saying,

17:26.746 --> 17:30.081
you will be standing here
delivering your monologue

17:30.083 --> 17:31.416
that you have chosen

17:31.418 --> 17:36.721
that will accentuate
how far, how deep,

17:36.723 --> 17:44.695
how wide your potential
as an actor should be.

17:44.697 --> 17:49.400
The great Evan polus has
interested me as his gatekeeper

17:49.402 --> 17:52.303
to determine
who gets in his class

17:52.305 --> 17:57.241
and who get stopped
short of stardom.

17:57.243 --> 17:59.377
If your group succeeds,

17:59.379 --> 18:03.247
you will advance
to Evan polus' class

18:03.249 --> 18:05.683
and have the opportunity

18:05.685 --> 18:11.789
to be in Hollywood's
greatest showcase ever.

18:13.426 --> 18:17.829
Do you wanna work
eight, ten fucking hours?

18:17.831 --> 18:20.565
You own nothing.
You got nothing.

18:20.567 --> 18:23.668
Do you know I eat octopus
three times a day?

18:23.670 --> 18:27.438
I've got octopus coming
out of my fucking ears.

18:27.440 --> 18:31.876
I got the fucking Russian shoes,
and my feet is coming through.

18:31.878 --> 18:35.413
Hey, I'm no fucking
criminal, man.

18:35.415 --> 18:38.716
I'm Tony Montana,
political prisoner from Cuba,

18:38.718 --> 18:41.419
and I want my fucking
human rights now.

18:43.590 --> 18:47.391
What a dork!

18:47.393 --> 18:48.693
Good job, rowe.

18:48.695 --> 18:51.696
That shit sucked!

18:51.698 --> 18:55.666
As you can see, no one
can become a star overnight.

18:55.668 --> 18:58.436
It is an evolution.

18:58.438 --> 19:01.873
Even Brad Pitt was
a pathetic little lungfish.

19:01.875 --> 19:03.908
Then we made him a star.

19:03.910 --> 19:05.743
Brad Pitt didn't go here.

19:05.745 --> 19:08.312
I don't know, did he?

19:08.314 --> 19:11.315
Mr. Italy, do you have a name?

19:11.317 --> 19:13.818
Rubisio uccellini.

19:13.820 --> 19:15.820
And I have a lot more
than just a name.

19:15.822 --> 19:17.355
Beautiful.

19:17.357 --> 19:19.824
Let the evolution begin.

19:23.162 --> 19:28.666
Max calls me up and says,
"que ce dice, my brotha?

19:28.668 --> 19:30.234
I think I got heat.

19:30.236 --> 19:33.504
Stay on this cell phone
with me."

19:33.506 --> 19:35.439
He comes out of his driveway
and says,

19:35.441 --> 19:40.745
"oh! I think they're coming from
every direction, my brotha!

19:40.747 --> 19:45.249
I got bags full of money
just buried in my lawn."

19:45.251 --> 19:49.954
So that night,
I'm out there with a flashlight

19:49.956 --> 19:52.823
just digging up bags of money!

19:54.426 --> 19:55.626
The end.

19:58.565 --> 20:01.232
Uccellini! Ha ha!

20:04.369 --> 20:05.770
Good job, rubisio.

20:07.607 --> 20:09.840
Uh, quick question.

20:09.842 --> 20:12.543
Our assignment
was to prepare a monologue

20:12.545 --> 20:13.844
from a narrative film, right?

20:13.846 --> 20:15.279
Right.

20:15.281 --> 20:16.847
That was from a documentary.

20:16.849 --> 20:18.482
Who the hell are you?

20:18.484 --> 20:20.785
It's a monologue
taken from an amazing movie,

20:20.787 --> 20:22.920
the <i> cocaine cowboys.</i>

20:22.922 --> 20:25.790
Which was a documentary
with live interviews,

20:25.792 --> 20:27.959
so there weren't actually
actors in it.

20:27.961 --> 20:29.260
It was real.

20:29.262 --> 20:31.629
John Wayne was cowboy!

20:31.631 --> 20:33.731
He was a real cowboy.

20:33.733 --> 20:35.700
So if you're not a fan
of real movies,

20:35.702 --> 20:37.335
then you're probably
not gonna be a fan

20:37.337 --> 20:39.003
of all the other real shit
that I have for you.

20:39.005 --> 20:40.504
Cut!

20:40.506 --> 20:41.672
Let's see what you got,
Shakespeare.

20:41.674 --> 20:43.441
The director has yelled cut!

20:44.810 --> 20:46.711
Now, class, self-control

20:46.713 --> 20:50.314
is an important aspect
of this business.

20:50.316 --> 20:53.884
Sometimes it's okay
to punch a thrust.

20:53.886 --> 20:58.422
Other times, you need
to punch a thrust.

20:58.424 --> 20:59.690
Yes, chance.

20:59.692 --> 21:01.859
Did John Wayne
really smoke cocaine?

21:01.861 --> 21:03.761
I'm right here, chance.

21:03.763 --> 21:07.732
And no, John Wayne
was not a cocaine cowboy.

21:07.734 --> 21:09.934
Can my monologue be
John Wayne?

21:09.936 --> 21:12.436
Did you prepare
a John Wayne monologue?

21:12.438 --> 21:16.707
The title of my monologue
is "Ruby."

21:16.709 --> 21:19.477
Ruby. Ruby.
What is Ruby?

21:19.479 --> 21:23.714
Ruby is an Italian guy
who is in my acting class.

21:23.716 --> 21:26.417
He thinks he's really big
and macho.

21:26.419 --> 21:29.020
But if Ruby had
half the cock I have,

21:29.022 --> 21:31.856
he wouldn't have to be
so macho, would he?

21:31.858 --> 21:34.492
Que dice, beeyotch!

21:34.494 --> 21:36.494
Um, uh...

21:36.496 --> 21:39.597
Give me back my family, fucker!

21:47.873 --> 21:50.374
You know, one time, I...

21:50.376 --> 21:52.743
I had to be in a little play,

21:52.745 --> 21:56.681
and I...
I swallowed the harmonica.

21:56.683 --> 22:00.451
They had to give me
the hemlock treatment.

22:02.087 --> 22:05.523
Why'd you leave me here
all alone?

22:05.525 --> 22:07.892
You were my best friend,
Michael.

22:09.394 --> 22:10.428
Scene?

22:19.071 --> 22:21.405
Who's next?

22:21.407 --> 22:23.641
Ah.

22:23.643 --> 22:25.476
How 'bout you?

22:25.478 --> 22:29.046
Tears just streamed down
my tired eyes.

22:31.950 --> 22:33.951
And then he came.

22:35.954 --> 22:38.122
And he kissed me.

22:40.659 --> 22:45.429
And with a ring on my finger

22:45.431 --> 22:47.565
and in a promise in my heart,

22:47.567 --> 22:51.936
I can say that I am loved.

22:51.938 --> 22:53.904
Alas...

22:53.906 --> 22:56.540
I am finally loved.

22:59.578 --> 23:01.045
Scene.

23:06.818 --> 23:08.386
Brilliant.

23:08.388 --> 23:10.821
Not a single string in my heart
was unstrung.

23:10.823 --> 23:16.160
I feel like I was ridden hard
and put away hot and wet.

23:17.696 --> 23:19.463
Okay, it is time

23:19.465 --> 23:21.966
for you to become acquainted
with your fellow numbers.

23:21.968 --> 23:24.835
You will be rehearsing
with them this week.

23:24.837 --> 23:28.172
Que se dice, my brothas!

23:28.174 --> 23:31.008
Now it looks like this group
might have a fighting chance.

23:31.010 --> 23:32.543
Why is that?

23:32.545 --> 23:36.046
Why? Because I'm in it
tinker bell.

23:36.048 --> 23:41.585
Tony Montana, puta, octopus!

23:41.587 --> 23:44.188
Dork!

23:44.190 --> 23:47.525
Well, welcome. We're just trying
to figure out where to meet

23:47.527 --> 23:48.793
to practice our scene.

23:48.795 --> 23:49.994
Do you live close by?

23:49.996 --> 23:52.663
You got a house, don't you?

23:52.665 --> 23:55.032
- Yeah, but--
- okay, cool. Let's go there.

23:55.034 --> 23:56.434
No. It's not
the kind of place where-

23:56.436 --> 23:58.436
hey, we're going
to your house.

23:58.438 --> 24:01.205
The dork, the fairy and i
will see you there.

24:01.207 --> 24:03.641
Uccellini is out.

24:07.813 --> 24:10.881
He just made the bear
touch my penis.

24:10.883 --> 24:13.818
Oh, my god,
you were so amazing, babe.

24:13.820 --> 24:17.922
Like your boobs were heaving
and your mouth was like,

24:17.924 --> 24:20.691
like pulsing with rage and--

24:20.693 --> 24:23.060
see, I thought
i was the best too.

24:23.062 --> 24:26.030
Your hair is like
so silky and--

24:26.032 --> 24:27.731
- hi, Nikki.
- Hey.

24:27.733 --> 24:31.602
Hey, just so you know,
stalking is a felony.

24:31.604 --> 24:33.604
Heidi, rude.

24:33.606 --> 24:36.006
- You go here now?
- Yeah.

24:36.008 --> 24:37.608
Gotta go.

24:41.613 --> 24:42.913
Mm!

24:45.784 --> 24:48.519
Help me, mommy!

24:48.521 --> 24:53.858
I'm a big stalker
creepy douchebag!

24:57.196 --> 25:02.032
I can reserve the banquet hall
at my community center.

25:02.034 --> 25:04.902
We'll have plenty
of privacy there.

25:04.904 --> 25:06.670
That's a really
good idea, Ruth.

25:06.672 --> 25:08.539
Maybe after we rehearse
a couple of times,

25:08.541 --> 25:10.708
we could have some of your
neighbors was us perform it.

25:10.710 --> 25:15.079
Oh, wait until
the older folks see you.

25:15.081 --> 25:20.084
They're gonna wanna snuggle you
six days from Sunday.

25:24.122 --> 25:27.157
I've wanted you for so long.

25:27.159 --> 25:29.727
But this just feels so wrong.

25:29.729 --> 25:32.029
Shh. Don't think about it.

25:32.031 --> 25:34.298
Just enjoy the fact
that you're about to be

25:34.300 --> 25:38.102
with the best-looking man
in your life.

25:38.104 --> 25:40.771
Uccellini.

25:40.773 --> 25:42.239
Uccellini?

25:42.241 --> 25:43.874
Yeah.

25:43.876 --> 25:45.709
Come here.

25:48.781 --> 25:49.847
Lulu.

25:49.849 --> 25:53.083
I slave away all day

25:53.085 --> 25:56.754
while you stay in my office
and humpy hump?

25:56.756 --> 25:58.055
What, this?

25:58.057 --> 26:00.057
No. We were just
talking is all.

26:00.059 --> 26:01.191
Nothing happen, Lulu.

26:01.193 --> 26:03.027
You shut your mouth, lele.

26:05.330 --> 26:06.730
Ow, Lulu.

26:06.732 --> 26:08.232
Lulu, stop.

26:08.234 --> 26:11.602
Stop. Listen.
Look, we talked about this,

26:11.604 --> 26:15.139
a guy that looks as good as I do
can't be monogamous forever.

26:15.141 --> 26:17.775
Sometimes I need
something different, you know?

26:17.777 --> 26:19.243
A little strange.

26:19.245 --> 26:21.111
Strange?

26:21.113 --> 26:24.148
And that's why you wanna be
with my twin sister?

26:24.150 --> 26:25.916
You dumb little fuck!

26:25.918 --> 26:29.353
Ow! Ow! Okay, okay.
Listen, stop.

26:29.355 --> 26:31.055
What about my headshots?

26:31.057 --> 26:34.758
You dropped your little
gummy worm in the wrong pond.

26:34.760 --> 26:36.827
Now you have no headshots!

26:36.829 --> 26:38.329
Ow! Okay, look, look, look.

26:38.331 --> 26:40.331
Listen, what if i
go to the house,

26:40.333 --> 26:43.367
and we talk about this
when you get home?

26:43.369 --> 26:45.970
You don't have a house anymore,
hotshot.

26:45.972 --> 26:47.304
You just got evicted.

26:47.306 --> 26:50.341
Oh, hello!
Come on in, take a seat.

26:50.343 --> 26:53.143
Lulu, let's talk
one more time, please.

26:54.846 --> 26:56.380
Hey, you know what?

26:56.382 --> 26:58.682
You're the one
that's missing out.

26:58.684 --> 27:00.351
Uccellini! Uhh!

27:07.692 --> 27:09.393
This mind and this body?

27:09.395 --> 27:11.295
She's gonna be
on a wounded knee,

27:11.297 --> 27:14.031
begging this prodigy son
to return.

27:14.033 --> 27:16.200
I think what
you're referring to

27:16.202 --> 27:20.104
just happens to be
the story of prodigal son.

27:20.106 --> 27:24.308
It has absolutely nothing to do
with Asian sisters

27:24.310 --> 27:26.844
or wounded knees

27:26.846 --> 27:30.180
or morons in leisure suits
on the fucking clock.

27:30.182 --> 27:32.316
Hey, step down, old man.

27:32.318 --> 27:36.220
We don't any philigisticsum from
the walnut gallery, all right?

27:36.222 --> 27:40.424
The prodigal son
was ignorant and arrogant.

27:40.426 --> 27:43.227
But he had all the necessary
means for success,

27:43.229 --> 27:45.763
but only after returning home

27:45.765 --> 27:48.966
to the wisdom and guidance
of his father.

27:48.968 --> 27:53.337
You have the roar of a lion,

27:53.339 --> 27:59.243
but a lion who's stuck
in a cold cage,

27:59.245 --> 28:02.446
waiting to be warmed up,

28:02.448 --> 28:06.050
warmed enough so you can
crawl out of your den

28:06.052 --> 28:09.086
and discover your time to kill.

28:11.456 --> 28:14.925
It has all the elements we need:
Greed, passion, anger, jealousy.

28:14.927 --> 28:16.360
I say we go for it.

28:16.362 --> 28:18.929
I'm not doing a scene
from <i> bring it on.</i>

28:18.931 --> 28:20.731
Sounds like a total bitch fest.

28:20.733 --> 28:24.768
And rubisio uccellini
ain't no bitch.

28:24.770 --> 28:27.404
I say we do a scene
from <i> the godfather.</i>

28:27.406 --> 28:30.140
Actually, I've never seen
<i> the godfather.</i>

28:30.142 --> 28:31.775
That's 'cause
you're an idiot.

28:31.777 --> 28:34.011
Oh, that's productive.

28:34.013 --> 28:36.113
Oh, othello's here.

28:36.115 --> 28:38.449
Of course I'm here.
This is my house.

28:38.451 --> 28:40.384
And it's really nice.

28:40.386 --> 28:44.021
Come on, you guys, why don't we
do a scene from <i> stand by me?</i>

28:44.023 --> 28:46.290
There's four of them,
and there's four of us.

28:46.292 --> 28:47.991
There we go.
That's a start.

28:47.993 --> 28:49.326
Three claps for rowe.

28:49.328 --> 28:51.495
Those kids are like
eight years old.

28:51.497 --> 28:53.497
I'm not gonna pretend
to be a kid.

28:53.499 --> 28:56.133
Oh, I don't think
you'd have to pretend.

29:04.976 --> 29:07.778
Were they friends
with Michael?

29:07.780 --> 29:08.946
No, hansel.

29:08.948 --> 29:11.148
That was from a monologue.

29:11.150 --> 29:13.984
These are actors
from an acting class.

29:53.391 --> 29:56.093
Hi. Hey, sir.
Uh, I'm rowe.

29:56.095 --> 29:59.429
I'm sure you are.

29:59.431 --> 30:01.331
And that's my hookah.

30:01.333 --> 30:03.867
Oh, I'm so sorry, i--

30:07.005 --> 30:08.505
What the fuck?

30:12.443 --> 30:13.577
Thank you.

30:48.580 --> 30:50.080
Ugh.

31:00.525 --> 31:03.927
I no wanna you go, papa.

31:03.929 --> 31:06.463
That's gonna be
on television?

31:06.465 --> 31:09.233
They're performing for us.
You're interrupting.

31:09.235 --> 31:11.468
Well, I hate it.
I want my ticket money back.

31:11.470 --> 31:15.973
I'll miss you like the dickens,
sweetheart.

31:17.943 --> 31:19.643
I love you, papa.

31:21.880 --> 31:24.948
Why is that girl calling
that little boy "daddy"?

31:24.950 --> 31:29.419
Is this some of that
perverted adult smut?

31:29.421 --> 31:32.623
It's a theatrical performance,
you blowhard!

31:32.625 --> 31:34.658
Like a dinner theater?

31:34.660 --> 31:37.628
Like a dinner theater, Lenny.

31:37.630 --> 31:40.564
Well, I'd like
a Salisbury steak.

31:40.566 --> 31:44.368
That tears it! That tears it!
That tears it!

31:44.370 --> 31:46.470
That's the end of it!
The end of it!

31:46.472 --> 31:51.441
Oh, dear, oh, dear,
oh, dear.

31:51.443 --> 31:55.913
It's not my fault that nobody
wants to hire these rejects.

31:55.915 --> 31:57.481
So tell them that.

31:57.483 --> 32:00.017
Listen here,
you dry humping fuck,

32:00.019 --> 32:04.554
you don't tell daddy what
he can and what he can't do.

32:04.556 --> 32:07.958
You know, you do a lot of
talking with your pelvic region.

32:21.572 --> 32:24.308
Where the fuck is chance?

32:31.649 --> 32:33.383
Hey, drew.

32:33.385 --> 32:34.518
Oh, hey, Hannah.

32:34.520 --> 32:36.353
How did it go
with your group?

32:36.355 --> 32:41.491
Uh, I wouldn't really know
how to put it into words.

32:41.493 --> 32:44.528
- Hey, drew-hoo.
- Oh, hey, Nikki.

32:44.530 --> 32:47.197
Um, Nikki, this is Hannah.
Hannah, Nikki.

32:47.199 --> 32:48.665
Hey, Nikki.

32:48.667 --> 32:51.134
Um, it's nice to meet you.

32:51.136 --> 32:53.103
Uh, Hannah is in
the other class with me.

32:53.105 --> 32:55.238
Oh. Yeah.

32:55.240 --> 32:57.374
Well, I will see you in there.

32:57.376 --> 32:59.376
Yeah.

32:59.378 --> 33:00.677
Break a leg.

33:00.679 --> 33:03.447
Thank you.

33:05.250 --> 33:07.551
Looks like she broke
more than just a leg.

33:07.553 --> 33:09.753
Poor girl.

33:09.755 --> 33:12.022
She's pretty good, actually.

33:12.024 --> 33:14.157
Yeah, well,
she's not a star.

33:14.159 --> 33:17.160
Once you're here for a while,
you'll see.

33:17.162 --> 33:19.129
So what's the difference
between the two classes?

33:19.131 --> 33:20.130
I gotta go.

33:20.132 --> 33:23.433
Evan: Unleash the beast!

33:23.435 --> 33:24.501
Okay.

33:25.503 --> 33:28.338
Chance, where the fuck are you?

33:28.340 --> 33:31.641
- Move it or lose it, bitch!
- Whoa! Jeez!

33:34.413 --> 33:39.616
Oh, please, darling,
won't you reconsider?

33:39.618 --> 33:41.451
I can hardly breathe,

33:41.453 --> 33:44.154
thinking about you
not being here,

33:44.156 --> 33:46.123
laying next to me.

33:46.125 --> 33:48.158
Well, duty calls,
sweet cheeks,

33:48.160 --> 33:53.530
and this cowboy don't back down
to anyone or anything.

33:53.532 --> 33:56.400
I no wanna you go, papa.

33:56.402 --> 34:00.270
Uh, now you listen,
and you listen good, son.

34:00.272 --> 34:03.173
While I'm gone,
you're the man of this ranch.

34:03.175 --> 34:05.542
Now, I want you
to feed the chickens

34:05.544 --> 34:07.644
and milk them cows,
you hear?

34:09.481 --> 34:12.416
And I want you to make sure
that your mother and sister

34:12.418 --> 34:17.219
are never fondled
by the other cowhands.

34:17.222 --> 34:19.623
Hannah: I love you, daddy.

34:27.465 --> 34:29.433
Yippee-ki-yay!

34:29.435 --> 34:32.436
Neigh! Neigh!

34:39.277 --> 34:40.277
Action!

34:41.779 --> 34:44.648
Men, I'm gonna ask you
one more time.

34:44.650 --> 34:46.817
Who screwed up my mess hall?

34:46.819 --> 34:48.652
Sir, it was not me, sir.

34:48.654 --> 34:50.320
I didn't even
eat anything last night.

34:50.322 --> 34:52.755
Then you're dismissed,
soldier.

34:52.757 --> 34:54.257
Get out of my face!

34:55.426 --> 34:57.260
It wasn't me, sir.

34:57.262 --> 34:59.663
I took an oath to serve this
country and to tell the truth.

34:59.665 --> 35:02.732
As a result,
i can't tell a lie-lie.

35:02.734 --> 35:05.802
Saved by the don't ask,
don't tell clause.

35:05.804 --> 35:09.840
Lieutenant, that's already
been totally amended already.

35:09.842 --> 35:11.374
Ugh.

35:11.376 --> 35:13.877
Back to your bunker!

35:13.879 --> 35:13.877
And you, soldier?

35:17.682 --> 35:20.350
I don't really care what
you have to say for yourself.

35:20.352 --> 35:23.320
You made me question
the validity of basic training.

35:23.322 --> 35:25.655
One of these days, I'm gonna
give you what you deserve.

35:25.657 --> 35:27.390
Really?
Are those even the lines?

35:27.392 --> 35:28.792
Shut up, soldier!

35:28.794 --> 35:31.795
You're a sorry excuse
for a human being!

35:31.797 --> 35:33.296
Scene!

35:33.298 --> 35:35.532
Whoo-hoo!

35:39.337 --> 35:41.338
Groups two and three?

35:47.745 --> 35:50.447
You have advanced
to Evan polus' class!

35:56.921 --> 35:58.622
Whoo!

35:58.624 --> 36:01.458
Drewy, we smashed it!

36:01.460 --> 36:03.193
Uccellini!

36:03.195 --> 36:05.562
Suckers!

36:05.564 --> 36:07.397
Tomorrow, 2:00.

36:07.399 --> 36:09.533
Everyone coming with me.

36:09.535 --> 36:11.668
Oh, I got work
in the morning.

36:11.670 --> 36:13.203
Drew, are you sure?

36:19.243 --> 36:21.244
Positive.

36:21.246 --> 36:22.846
That's fine.

36:22.848 --> 36:25.582
I'll just pick
something up for him.

36:25.584 --> 36:27.250
Tout's presh.

36:27.252 --> 36:28.752
Ugh.

36:28.754 --> 36:30.187
Move.

36:30.189 --> 36:32.722
Uccellini!

36:36.694 --> 36:40.397
Okay, okay.
I'll tell them.

36:40.399 --> 36:44.534
- Adrian can't make it.
- Well, let's just go inside.

36:44.536 --> 36:47.470
Honestly, I really don't
wanna wait for rubisio.

36:47.472 --> 36:50.740
We said that we would, rowe.
We have to wait for him.

36:52.210 --> 36:54.911
Que se dice?
What's up, ladies?

36:54.913 --> 36:58.782
Anybody up for a little game
of two on one?

36:58.784 --> 37:02.319
Hi, rubisio.
You're looking nice today.

37:02.321 --> 37:03.520
Well, thank you, Hannah.

37:03.522 --> 37:05.355
You look mighty fine
yourself, woman.

37:05.357 --> 37:07.591
Come on.
Let's go get our shop on.

37:07.593 --> 37:08.992
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

37:08.994 --> 37:11.528
I'm not giving
these little rats a dime.

37:11.530 --> 37:12.696
Rats?

37:12.698 --> 37:14.331
How can you say no
to those girls?

37:14.333 --> 37:15.565
They're so precious.

37:15.567 --> 37:17.734
They stand right outside
the entrance,

37:17.736 --> 37:19.903
pressuring everyone
with their hard sale tactics.

37:19.905 --> 37:21.471
Rubisio, they're kids.

37:21.473 --> 37:25.442
They are not employing tactics
to move cookies.

37:25.444 --> 37:28.812
Hello. Would you like to buy
some cookies for charity?

37:28.814 --> 37:30.780
Que se dice, little lady?

37:30.782 --> 37:32.749
We'd love to, but unfortunately
our friend here

37:32.751 --> 37:34.718
can't be within 100 feet
of children.

37:36.254 --> 37:38.421
What? No, no, no, no.
That's not true.

37:38.423 --> 37:41.591
- Tell her that's not true!
- It is true.

37:41.593 --> 37:43.326
I'm so sorry.
That's not true at all.

37:43.328 --> 37:44.928
That's not cool at all!
What are you doing?

37:44.930 --> 37:46.997
Hey, shut up.
I saved you 7 bucks.

37:53.671 --> 37:56.406
Where the fuck is chance?

37:57.675 --> 37:58.842
Chance!

38:04.582 --> 38:06.683
This place is gross.

38:06.685 --> 38:08.985
Oh, that's not very nice.

38:08.987 --> 38:11.821
You know, you gotta stop
being such a bully.

38:17.762 --> 38:19.362
Waitress: You guys ready?

38:19.364 --> 38:24.401
Yeah. I'll take the bacon burger
with no lettuce.

38:24.403 --> 38:25.935
And your choice
of a house salad,

38:25.937 --> 38:28.405
regular or sweet potato fries.

38:28.407 --> 38:29.773
I'll take the house salad.

38:29.775 --> 38:31.808
Okay. And you?

38:31.810 --> 38:33.810
Yes, I'm gonna enjoy
the Turkey burger

38:33.812 --> 38:35.812
and Caesar salad, please.

38:35.814 --> 38:39.516
Great, and I'm pretty sure
they're out of the grape soda,

38:39.518 --> 38:41.885
so is cola okay?

38:45.623 --> 38:46.656
Yeah, sure.

38:46.658 --> 38:47.824
Okay.

38:49.860 --> 38:51.928
- Who said grape, drew?
- Chill.

38:51.930 --> 38:53.763
She probably got you confused
with somebody else.

38:53.765 --> 38:55.498
Chill? Look, man,

38:55.500 --> 38:57.767
the day my skin color
does not dictate

38:57.769 --> 38:59.903
the fallacious assumptions
of ignorant individuals

38:59.905 --> 39:02.772
is the day
i will chill, brotha.

39:02.774 --> 39:04.974
That sounds like something
i heard last February.

39:04.976 --> 39:07.043
Oh, now we're hating on
black history month, huh?

39:07.045 --> 39:09.979
All this over
a purple drink.

39:15.553 --> 39:17.921
How many goddamn times
do I have to tell you

39:17.923 --> 39:21.925
we have an appointment to do
our headshots right fucking now?

39:21.927 --> 39:24.094
- I do not remember.
- What do you expect?

39:24.096 --> 39:27.797
Me to just float up
onto that horse, you fuckface?

39:27.799 --> 39:30.033
Get your ostrich ass
out of this thrift store

39:30.035 --> 39:32.802
and into the urine-filled
streets now!

39:34.372 --> 39:36.973
If I hit something,
you're dead meat.

39:42.580 --> 39:44.848
Now, look, I don't care
how long this takes.

39:44.850 --> 39:47.851
You were late,
so now you're gonna pay.

39:47.853 --> 39:49.953
Now are you ready?

39:49.955 --> 39:51.955
Hold on.
Let me warm up.

39:57.461 --> 39:59.496
Yeah!

39:59.498 --> 40:01.631
Uh-huh.

40:01.633 --> 40:02.799
Uh-huh.

40:04.602 --> 40:07.737
- Okay.
- Why don't you check your lens?

40:07.739 --> 40:09.639
Is it even working?

40:09.641 --> 40:10.640
Mm-hmm.

40:10.642 --> 40:12.475
We're done.

40:12.477 --> 40:14.077
- Why are we shopping here?
- I'm a struggling actor.

40:14.079 --> 40:15.678
I can't afford anything else.

40:15.680 --> 40:17.714
You're not an actor.
You're an idiot.

40:17.716 --> 40:19.449
Cool, I'm an idiot.

40:19.451 --> 40:21.885
Freeze, pervert!
Put your hands up in the air!

40:21.887 --> 40:24.020
- What did I do?
- Grab him, rookie.

40:24.022 --> 40:25.555
Oh, it's on now.
Come here!

40:25.557 --> 40:27.157
Oh, my god!
Why are you so big?

40:27.159 --> 40:30.794
- Ow! Ow!
- Shut up, you little pervert!

40:30.796 --> 40:32.162
I literally
didn't do anything!

40:32.164 --> 40:35.498
Tell them!
Tell them I didn't do anything!

40:35.500 --> 40:37.000
Get your ass
up against this bike.

40:37.002 --> 40:40.570
You lie to us one more time,
and you will be tased!

40:40.572 --> 40:43.139
- I never lied.
- Put him on the ground, rookie!

40:43.141 --> 40:44.474
Absolutely.

40:44.476 --> 40:45.508
Yeah!

40:45.510 --> 40:47.177
You think it's funny?

40:47.179 --> 40:48.978
- No! No!
- You think it's funny?

40:48.980 --> 40:50.880
Do you think it's funny?

40:50.882 --> 40:52.515
Ow! You're too tight!

40:52.517 --> 40:54.951
Ow! It's too tight, sir!

40:54.953 --> 40:56.085
Too tight?
How 'bout this?

40:56.087 --> 41:00.123
Oh, my god! Ow!
Oh, my god!

41:00.125 --> 41:01.558
You think it's funny?

41:01.560 --> 41:03.092
Enough, rookie!

41:03.094 --> 41:04.461
Enough!

41:06.231 --> 41:08.465
Bacon burger with a salad.

41:08.467 --> 41:10.033
Thank you very much.

41:10.035 --> 41:12.035
Fried chicken, burnt pork
and sweet potato fries.

41:12.037 --> 41:13.870
Fried chicken?
I ordered a salad.

41:13.872 --> 41:16.072
Oh. I thought you said
sweet potato--

41:16.074 --> 41:18.041
salad.

41:18.043 --> 41:21.010
We don't have
sweet potato salad.

41:24.181 --> 41:27.917
Free at last,
my black ass.

41:27.919 --> 41:29.619
This is bullshit.

41:29.621 --> 41:30.854
Okay?

41:30.856 --> 41:34.157
You eat the chicken wing.

41:34.159 --> 41:37.026
Sir, I didn't even know
half fingers were included.

41:37.028 --> 41:38.995
Just like you didn't think
acting like a pedophile

41:38.997 --> 41:40.864
was against the law?

41:40.866 --> 41:43.633
- Sir, I didn't--
- you didn't? You didn't?

41:43.635 --> 41:46.035
- Mm-hmm.
- Well, now you know, Mary.

41:46.037 --> 41:49.606
If I ever see you blink
in the direction of a child,

41:49.608 --> 41:51.207
you will be tased,
no questions asked.

41:51.209 --> 41:52.575
Are we clear, Mary?

41:52.577 --> 41:54.043
- Mary?
- Are we clear?

41:54.045 --> 41:55.778
Yes, sir.

41:58.282 --> 42:01.084
Now get out of my face,

42:01.086 --> 42:04.721
and get out
of the shopping center.

42:04.723 --> 42:08.091
God! What the fuck?
What the fuck? Oh, my god!

42:08.093 --> 42:09.859
You did good, rookie.

42:09.861 --> 42:12.862
You made him run
like a little bitch.

42:20.538 --> 42:22.805
- Hey, you.
- Hannah, hey.

42:22.807 --> 42:25.675
I got you
two medium shirts,

42:25.677 --> 42:27.277
one blue and one purple.

42:27.279 --> 42:31.714
I figured they'd look
good on you. I...

42:33.684 --> 42:36.252
I hope you like them.

42:36.254 --> 42:38.121
Oh, uh, thank you.

42:38.123 --> 42:40.857
Oh, my gosh,
you didn't have to do that.

42:40.859 --> 42:42.759
- Wow. These are nice.
- Yeah.

42:42.761 --> 42:44.627
Um, can you just...

42:44.629 --> 42:46.930
Oh. Yeah.

42:46.932 --> 42:48.898
- There you go.
- Thank you.

42:50.701 --> 42:52.569
So how did...

42:52.571 --> 42:53.803
Oh, um...

42:53.805 --> 42:55.805
My aunt has an equestrian farm,

42:55.807 --> 42:59.642
and one day
i was practicing...

42:59.644 --> 43:04.747
My uncle's tractor backfired
and spooked the horse.

43:04.749 --> 43:06.182
Wow.

43:06.184 --> 43:09.218
I fell and, um...

43:09.220 --> 43:13.122
I pretty much lost the sensation
in the right side of my body.

43:13.124 --> 43:17.060
I get pissed off
when my leg falls asleep, huh?

43:18.996 --> 43:20.730
That's not what I meant.
I'm sorry.

43:20.732 --> 43:23.199
- I'm so sorry that happened.
- No, it's okay.

43:23.201 --> 43:25.735
What about you, drew Thomas?

43:25.737 --> 43:28.338
I finished law school
last spring.

43:28.340 --> 43:29.839
You're a lawyer?

43:29.841 --> 43:31.841
Well, uh, not exactly.

43:31.843 --> 43:35.178
I'm a minimum wage telemarketer
until I can pass the bar.

43:35.180 --> 43:38.114
Then what are you doing
at starmaker academy?

43:49.861 --> 43:52.261
Thank you for calling

44:04.409 --> 44:09.712
'Cause like I used to have
a Jennifer Lopez ass.

44:09.714 --> 44:15.685
I could shake it like, you know,
Shakira on crack, you dig?

44:15.687 --> 44:20.423
<i> Fools used to get all sprung</i>
<i> when I walked by, you dig?</i>

44:34.005 --> 44:36.673
<i> Who said nothing</i>
<i> 'bout no husband?</i>

44:36.675 --> 44:40.176
<i> Now let me tell you something,</i>
<i> silver spoon boy.</i>

44:40.178 --> 44:42.145
We ain't all chillin',
eating caviar,

44:42.147 --> 44:43.713
<i> drinking red Merlot.</i>

44:43.715 --> 44:45.148
You dig?

44:45.150 --> 44:47.850
I said you dig?

44:47.852 --> 44:50.720
Yes, ma'am.

44:50.722 --> 44:52.955
What I get for free?

44:56.326 --> 45:01.464
You all walked in here
below average at best.

45:01.466 --> 45:03.232
But let me tell you,

45:03.234 --> 45:05.234
by the time
I'm finished with you,

45:05.236 --> 45:07.804
you'll have seen more
red carpet

45:07.806 --> 45:09.806
than the streets
have seen urine.

45:09.808 --> 45:14.444
Now, to my new students,

45:14.446 --> 45:16.779
it's simple.

45:16.781 --> 45:19.315
You just do exactly
what I tell you to do

45:19.317 --> 45:22.752
and how I tell you to do it.

45:22.754 --> 45:27.290
Okay, let's just take it up a
notch, have a bit of fun here.

45:27.292 --> 45:29.358
Who can we get?
Nikki, why don't you come up?

45:29.360 --> 45:30.359
Give me that.

45:32.362 --> 45:35.298
You have just returned
from the war.

45:35.300 --> 45:40.036
While you were in combat,
you stumbled on a land mine.

45:40.038 --> 45:43.072
It exploded,
killing three in your infantry,

45:43.074 --> 45:45.174
but luckily, you survived,

45:45.176 --> 45:48.311
but not before it blew off
both your legs, all right?

45:48.313 --> 45:49.345
Take that.

45:59.890 --> 46:02.759
You're a war hero, Nikki.

46:02.761 --> 46:05.928
But your fiancé,
he can't stand the sight of you.

46:05.930 --> 46:07.930
He's told you
that he doesn't love you

46:07.932 --> 46:09.766
without your beautiful feet

46:09.768 --> 46:12.001
and your pretty little
tippy toes.

46:12.003 --> 46:14.103
You are devastated.

46:14.105 --> 46:17.540
He's gonna leave you, Nikki,
so talk to him.

46:17.542 --> 46:19.809
Now, whenever you're ready.

46:26.483 --> 46:28.184
Why?

46:28.186 --> 46:30.953
Oh, Tommy, why?

46:30.955 --> 46:35.291
I loved you, and not just for
your hair or your eyes.

46:35.293 --> 46:37.260
I loved all of you!

46:37.262 --> 46:41.964
And what, because I don't have
regular feet or ankles or knees,

46:41.966 --> 46:43.800
you're leaving me?

46:46.004 --> 46:48.371
See, look at this.
See, you see this?

46:48.373 --> 46:50.139
Now, this is,
this is beautiful.

46:50.141 --> 46:52.575
This is fant--
you're blowing me away, baby.

46:52.577 --> 46:54.377
Nikki, you're blowing
everybody away.

46:54.379 --> 46:57.847
Stay in the moment, darling,
stay in the moment.

46:59.350 --> 47:01.818
I loved you!

47:01.820 --> 47:05.454
- You are so fucking beautiful.
- Thank you.

47:08.992 --> 47:12.128
What the-- Rachel!
What the fuck is going on here?

47:12.130 --> 47:15.398
- It's not like that at all.
- It's not what you think.

47:15.400 --> 47:18.367
What do you mean?
It's exactly what I think!

47:18.369 --> 47:21.103
You guys--
you're my sister! Rachel!

47:21.105 --> 47:23.206
What the--
you told me you loved me!

47:23.208 --> 47:25.575
You said you loved me!
Are you serious?

47:25.577 --> 47:28.177
That's disgusting!
Why would you do that to me?

47:28.179 --> 47:32.114
I fucking hate my life!
Honestly! Fuck you!

47:36.221 --> 47:40.223
Hey, fuck nuts, get up there,
sit next to your fiancé,

47:40.225 --> 47:43.492
who you so haphazardly
kicked to the curb.

47:43.494 --> 47:46.028
Go on! Get up there.

47:46.030 --> 47:48.998
Tell her why you can't
stand the sight of her.

47:49.000 --> 47:51.434
Beautiful, darling, beautiful.

47:51.436 --> 47:55.004
Why? Tell me why!

47:57.474 --> 47:59.008
Oh, you wimp.

48:00.611 --> 48:02.612
Uh, it's--

48:02.614 --> 48:06.349
it's not that I don't
love you, baby.

48:06.351 --> 48:08.951
It's just,
i live on the beach.

48:08.953 --> 48:11.454
What does that have to do
with you leaving me,

48:11.456 --> 48:13.022
you selfish bastard?

48:13.024 --> 48:14.891
What, now that you live
on the beach,

48:14.893 --> 48:17.026
I'm not good enough
for your beach friends?

48:19.463 --> 48:22.999
No. I mean,
it's just all the sand.

48:23.001 --> 48:25.001
I'm not strong enough
to push the wheelchair.

48:25.003 --> 48:27.637
I'm but a 110 pounds is all.

48:29.406 --> 48:32.108
Do you think this is good,
newbie?

48:32.110 --> 48:34.210
I don't know. I'm trying.

48:34.212 --> 48:35.678
Well, it's fucking terrible.

48:35.680 --> 48:38.047
Take him outside.
Warm his ass up.

48:40.183 --> 48:41.550
Oh, shit.

48:47.090 --> 48:50.092
Okay, so how does this work?
What are you gonna do?

48:50.094 --> 48:52.194
What the fuck? Ow!

48:52.196 --> 48:54.931
Come on, dude! It's too tight!
Ouch! I can't breathe!

48:54.933 --> 48:58.668
Get off me!
Get the fuck--

49:04.141 --> 49:06.676
I'm not dumping you
because you lost your legs.

49:06.678 --> 49:09.412
I'm leaving you because you've
been sleeping with my sister,

49:09.414 --> 49:11.047
you unfaithful whore!

49:11.049 --> 49:12.548
Here we go.

49:12.550 --> 49:14.383
You don't think I saw you
with her in the garage?

49:14.385 --> 49:16.218
I was in love with you.

49:16.220 --> 49:18.654
I was gonna take off this purity
ring and become one with you.

49:18.656 --> 49:20.122
But no! You betrayed me!

49:20.124 --> 49:22.124
Selfish bitch.

49:22.126 --> 49:23.526
That never happened.

49:23.528 --> 49:26.162
Shut your mouth, Rachel!
This is my turn!

49:26.164 --> 49:28.531
Unleash the beast,
you son of a bitch!

49:28.533 --> 49:29.632
Time to kill!

49:34.539 --> 49:37.340
The doctor said
you lost both your legs,

49:37.342 --> 49:40.242
but he forgot to mention
the most important part of you

49:40.244 --> 49:42.478
lost forever.

49:42.480 --> 49:44.380
Your heart!

49:53.557 --> 49:54.557
Scene.

49:54.559 --> 49:57.660
Beautiful. Beautiful!

49:57.662 --> 50:00.129
You see, everyone?
You noticed that?

50:00.131 --> 50:03.566
I eliminated his fear
and allowed the adrenaline

50:03.568 --> 50:07.770
to unleash the brilliant
acting beast inside of him.

50:07.772 --> 50:09.538
Nobody can teach this.

50:09.540 --> 50:11.574
Of course
that's why you're here.

50:11.576 --> 50:14.510
You're not gonna make it
in this business without me.

50:14.512 --> 50:17.680
You really blew me away.

50:19.282 --> 50:21.083
Guys, hush, please, for a sec.

50:21.085 --> 50:22.518
I'd just like to say,

50:22.520 --> 50:25.388
rowe, what you had tonight
was a breakthrough.

50:25.390 --> 50:28.057
Thanks, guys.

50:28.059 --> 50:30.493
Here's to everybody shutting up
already and drinking.

50:30.495 --> 50:32.161
Salud, bitches!

50:32.163 --> 50:35.197
Wait, wait, wait.
Before we all cheers this shit,

50:35.199 --> 50:38.267
when we all become stars,
what are you guys gonna do?

50:38.269 --> 50:41.570
I think I'll go to Milan,
start my own boutique.

50:41.572 --> 50:45.074
I guess I'm next.
Here's what I'm gonna do.

50:45.076 --> 50:46.742
I'm gonna play the field
for a while,

50:46.744 --> 50:48.511
and then once I hit it big,

50:48.513 --> 50:51.814
I'm gonna get Lulu back
'cause she's my rock.

50:51.816 --> 50:55.084
Check this out.
I'm gonna buy a clydesdale

50:55.086 --> 50:59.255
and ride that bitch
across the rockies.

50:59.257 --> 51:01.290
How 'bout you, Hannah?

51:01.292 --> 51:06.162
What I'd really like is to find
a guy that would love me for me.

51:06.164 --> 51:09.131
One day you're gonna
find that guy, and when you do,

51:09.133 --> 51:11.600
he's going to be
the luckiest guy in the world.

51:11.602 --> 51:13.436
That's a promise,
hotty-potatty.

51:13.438 --> 51:14.837
Ugh!

51:14.839 --> 51:17.440
Please, can we just toast
before we puke?

51:17.442 --> 51:19.475
Idiot.

51:19.477 --> 51:21.343
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

51:36.760 --> 51:41.363
Your hair is like,
it's like blonde silk, you know?

51:41.365 --> 51:44.767
It's like so smooth
like water,

51:44.769 --> 51:47.703
like cascading over the...

51:47.705 --> 51:50.673
Oh, my god,
it smells like heaven.

51:50.675 --> 51:52.808
Nikki.

51:52.810 --> 51:56.145
Oh, look.
Creeper boy is back.

51:56.147 --> 51:59.782
Lucky for you,
i gotta go potty.

52:05.522 --> 52:08.791
Naked pictures, huh?

52:08.793 --> 52:11.227
Same face, different body.
Really?

52:11.229 --> 52:13.829
It's not me.

52:13.831 --> 52:17.433
So I could just go online,
check 'em out.

52:17.435 --> 52:19.668
Oh, is that how you look
at naked girls?

52:19.670 --> 52:21.770
You go on the Internet?

52:21.772 --> 52:23.906
Damn, you got me.

52:23.908 --> 52:29.545
How could a little boy like you
deal with a woman like me?

52:30.914 --> 52:33.415
Que se dice, my Nikki?

52:33.417 --> 52:35.417
You up for a little game
of two on one?

52:35.419 --> 52:37.553
Rubisio.

52:37.555 --> 52:38.721
Hey, drew?

52:40.390 --> 52:41.524
What?

52:41.526 --> 52:43.559
Go fuck yourself.

52:47.664 --> 52:50.266
I'm gonna tell you what's
gonna happen here, Nikki.

52:50.268 --> 52:52.501
What's gonna happen here, drew?

52:52.503 --> 52:54.403
We're gonna take these shots,

52:54.405 --> 52:55.871
and we're gonna
go back to my house.

52:55.873 --> 52:58.307
How do you know
i even like you like that?

52:58.309 --> 53:01.243
Whoa! Who said anything
about liking anybody?

53:01.245 --> 53:03.412
Maybe I just wanna
run a scene with you.

53:03.414 --> 53:06.916
Oh, yeah? What kind of scene
is that, drew-hoo?

53:24.635 --> 53:26.869
Think that hurt you?
You have no idea.

53:38.949 --> 53:40.649
Take this off.

54:20.890 --> 54:22.524
Company policy clearly states

54:22.526 --> 54:24.693
no more than three inches
above the knee.

54:24.695 --> 54:26.629
You, young lady,
have no excuse

54:26.631 --> 54:28.397
because I suspect
you are quite experienced

54:28.399 --> 54:30.499
in measuring things
by the inch.

54:30.501 --> 54:32.368
Get out.

54:43.948 --> 54:45.814
Oh, shit.

54:54.392 --> 54:56.725
Deboard.

54:56.727 --> 54:58.594
Rrrrr...

54:58.596 --> 55:00.796
Choo-choo.

55:00.798 --> 55:03.365
You wanted to see me, Kathy?

55:04.735 --> 55:08.337
Do you know why we have
a schedule here, drew?

55:08.339 --> 55:09.938
I believe so.

55:09.940 --> 55:11.940
I don't think you do

55:11.942 --> 55:14.843
because if you did, you'd show
up to work every day on time,

55:14.845 --> 55:18.380
just like all those other
little worker bees out there.

55:18.382 --> 55:20.416
Sorry, Kathy,
it won't happen again.

55:20.418 --> 55:24.620
You're right, it won't because
this is your final warning.

55:24.622 --> 55:26.955
After that,
you'll be out on the streets,

55:26.957 --> 55:30.559
probably turning tricks
just to pay your rent.

55:30.561 --> 55:34.096
Do you know what it's like
to sell your body for sex, drew?

55:34.098 --> 55:35.664
Pants around your ankles

55:35.666 --> 55:39.902
in a dirty bathroom
somewhere downtown.

55:39.904 --> 55:42.871
In this economy, you'll be lucky
to get 20 bucks a blow.

55:46.810 --> 55:49.511
You know what?
I quit.

55:49.513 --> 55:52.014
You know what? I quit.

55:55.552 --> 55:56.719
I'm taking this!

56:00.890 --> 56:02.458
Psycho!

56:04.728 --> 56:06.762
You wanna be a star,
you dumb fuck,

56:06.764 --> 56:08.130
then answer my calls.

56:08.132 --> 56:09.965
Oh, I know what you're doing.

56:09.967 --> 56:11.667
I know you're
on your set, right?

56:11.669 --> 56:13.769
Making your fucking movie.

56:13.771 --> 56:16.805
You get your pampered-wearing
ass back to class,

56:16.807 --> 56:18.807
or I'm gonna toss you into
the urine-filled streets

56:18.809 --> 56:20.109
for the last time.

56:26.784 --> 56:28.784
Oh, yeah! Can you breathe?

56:28.786 --> 56:30.552
- Yeah, I can breathe.
- Oh, no, no.

56:30.554 --> 56:32.521
Now! Can you breathe now?

56:32.523 --> 56:34.957
- Yeah, I can still breathe.
- I bet you can't. You're lying.

56:34.959 --> 56:38.026
You little bitch.
You like being my bitch?

56:38.028 --> 56:39.895
No, I don't.

56:39.897 --> 56:42.064
You don't like being my bitch?
How about an ear?

56:42.066 --> 56:45.934
You like that, motherfucker?
You like that?

56:45.936 --> 56:47.469
- You like that?
- Ow.

56:47.471 --> 56:48.771
- You like that?
- Stop.

56:48.773 --> 56:50.773
Yeah? You warm yet,
you little bitch?

56:50.775 --> 56:52.107
I'm warm, I'm warm!

56:52.109 --> 56:54.109
Go and unleash your beast,
motherfucker.

57:04.721 --> 57:06.722
Hey, drew.

57:06.724 --> 57:09.558
- What?
- Go fuck yourself.

57:14.732 --> 57:18.634
Rose, you must
do me this honor.

57:18.636 --> 57:21.136
You must do me this honor.

57:21.138 --> 57:23.071
No matter what happens,

57:23.073 --> 57:25.707
you have to promise me
to survive.

57:29.145 --> 57:34.149
How hopeless you may be,

57:34.151 --> 57:37.920
you have to promise
you'll hold onto that promise.

57:37.922 --> 57:42.024
I promise. I promise.

57:42.026 --> 57:44.760
Never let go.

57:44.762 --> 57:46.962
Never let go.

57:46.964 --> 57:50.466
I'll never let go, Jack.

57:50.468 --> 57:52.501
I'll never let go.

57:58.041 --> 58:01.143
Ah, you see that, folks?
Did you see that?

58:01.145 --> 58:04.813
That is a big, dark
academy award-winning cloud,

58:04.815 --> 58:07.683
looming right there
over their heads.

58:07.685 --> 58:09.117
Well, get your umbrellas out.

58:09.119 --> 58:11.687
It's about to rain
a fucking Oscar!

58:11.689 --> 58:15.123
All right! Scene! Yes!

58:15.125 --> 58:16.558
Beautiful.

58:16.560 --> 58:21.230
All right, guys, well,
everyone...

58:21.232 --> 58:23.532
Important announcement.

58:23.534 --> 58:25.501
Showcase is in one week.

58:25.503 --> 58:28.136
This is a million-dollar
opportunity.

58:28.138 --> 58:31.173
I want you all to contribute
to each other's success,

58:31.175 --> 58:33.242
help each other,
get behind each other,

58:33.244 --> 58:35.110
root for each other.

58:35.112 --> 58:37.279
I want you to tell
all your friends and family.

58:37.281 --> 58:39.982
I want to pack this place
to the rafters.

58:39.984 --> 58:42.718
I wanna really
get the adrenaline flowing.

58:42.720 --> 58:46.121
I want it to be really fantastic
for you guys.

58:46.123 --> 58:49.658
So I want you all
to bring in $50 tomorrow

58:49.660 --> 58:53.529
to help offset my cost
for the showcase, okay?

58:53.531 --> 58:57.733
Sir, $50 is a lot of money
for me to spend right now.

58:59.269 --> 59:00.702
What?

59:00.704 --> 59:03.772
Sorry, did I hear that right?

59:03.774 --> 59:07.276
So you're gonna throw away your
whole career, worth millions,

59:07.278 --> 59:09.611
for a measly $50?

59:09.613 --> 59:11.647
Is that what you're telling
all the class here?

59:11.649 --> 59:12.948
You wanna quit?

59:12.950 --> 59:15.250
No, sir, that's not
what I meant.

59:15.252 --> 59:21.156
You know, I've given up
millions of dollars as an actor.

59:21.158 --> 59:25.227
I've suffered through
four very painful divorces

59:25.229 --> 59:27.296
for your ungrateful asses.

59:27.298 --> 59:30.265
You know, I was offered
the lead in <i> amadeus.</i>

59:30.267 --> 59:31.967
All right, it was the tour.

59:31.969 --> 59:35.604
I turned it down for my students
because I love them!

59:35.606 --> 59:37.339
And what do you do?

59:37.341 --> 59:41.677
You kick me right in the teeth
for 50 fucking dollars!

59:43.580 --> 59:45.681
Like your character, rose,

59:45.683 --> 59:48.050
as you were doing it
moments ago,

59:48.052 --> 59:50.986
when you were promising
your young toy boy,

59:50.988 --> 59:52.888
"oh, I'll never let you go!
Woo hoo hoo!

59:52.890 --> 59:56.792
I'll never let you go!
Never let you go!" What?

59:56.794 --> 01:00:01.997
Then the bitch lets him go
to the fucking ocean floor!

01:00:01.999 --> 01:00:03.899
Uh, uh...

01:00:03.901 --> 01:00:08.704
Grammy no gonna give no money.
No piggy bank, no.

01:00:08.706 --> 01:00:10.739
Jesus, take a knife.

01:00:13.009 --> 01:00:14.209
Yes.

01:00:14.211 --> 01:00:16.745
Besides our scene
and the money,

01:00:16.747 --> 01:00:21.283
is there anything else
we need to, you know, prepare?

01:00:21.285 --> 01:00:24.653
Thank you for asking
an intelligent question.

01:00:24.655 --> 01:00:25.954
Yes.

01:00:25.956 --> 01:00:31.093
You need to find
the beast inside you,

01:00:31.095 --> 01:00:34.830
and you need to
unleash the hell out of it.

01:00:34.832 --> 01:00:38.734
You see, this is your one chance
to take Hollywood by storm,

01:00:38.736 --> 01:00:41.103
so I want you to get
all your shit together,

01:00:41.105 --> 01:00:45.040
and I want you to really
blow these people away!

01:00:45.042 --> 01:00:47.242
I want you
to blow everyone away.

01:00:47.244 --> 01:00:51.046
Come on, people,
unleash your beast!

01:00:54.685 --> 01:00:56.885
There! That's it!
That's brilliant!

01:00:56.887 --> 01:00:59.121
He's the king!

01:00:59.123 --> 01:01:02.157
You have just earned yourself
a lead in the showcase.

01:01:02.159 --> 01:01:04.793
Whoo! Uccellini!

01:01:04.795 --> 01:01:07.362
He is now your king!
He's in charge!

01:01:07.364 --> 01:01:10.732
Evan is outta here!

01:01:13.302 --> 01:01:14.836
I'm in charge,

01:01:14.838 --> 01:01:16.805
which basically means
I'm the boss.

01:01:16.807 --> 01:01:19.675
We'll be meeting here
tomorrow at 7:00, capisce?

01:01:19.677 --> 01:01:21.076
How about we all decide

01:01:21.078 --> 01:01:23.145
what time is best for
the class, fuckface?

01:01:23.147 --> 01:01:24.880
Hey, it's been decided.

01:01:24.882 --> 01:01:26.815
Be here at 7:00,
or your little ass

01:01:26.817 --> 01:01:29.718
is out of the showcase and
into the urine-filled streets.

01:01:29.720 --> 01:01:31.086
Capisce?

01:01:33.790 --> 01:01:35.357
Evan: Yeah, come in.

01:01:36.859 --> 01:01:40.028
Sir, I have a concern

01:01:40.030 --> 01:01:42.397
burning in my bosom.

01:01:42.399 --> 01:01:45.467
Oh. Well, I have a concern

01:01:45.469 --> 01:01:48.103
that you're just
one thrust away

01:01:48.105 --> 01:01:50.338
from throwing out every disc
in your lower back,

01:01:50.340 --> 01:01:54.009
but I'm don't come barging
into your office, now, do I?

01:01:54.011 --> 01:01:56.311
They've had less than
one month of training.

01:01:56.313 --> 01:01:58.480
Don't you think
it's a little early for them

01:01:58.482 --> 01:02:01.750
to be exposed
to producers and agents?

01:02:01.752 --> 01:02:04.119
For Pete's sake.
What, their careers?

01:02:04.121 --> 01:02:06.088
I'm dealing with,
what, autism

01:02:06.090 --> 01:02:09.057
and 80-year-olds
drooling on my carpet.

01:02:09.059 --> 01:02:11.059
We've got degenerates here.

01:02:11.061 --> 01:02:12.494
They're not degenerates.

01:02:12.496 --> 01:02:14.496
They're individuals
with hopes and dreams

01:02:14.498 --> 01:02:16.465
just like everyone else.

01:02:16.467 --> 01:02:19.301
I've even got one that can't
manipulate 50% of her body.

01:02:19.303 --> 01:02:21.303
Her name is Hannah.

01:02:21.305 --> 01:02:24.106
And she's beautiful
and talented.

01:02:24.108 --> 01:02:26.141
So you tell that to the director
of <i> horse whisperer ii </i>

01:02:26.143 --> 01:02:27.843
when he calls to say,

01:02:27.845 --> 01:02:29.945
"Hannah couldn't hold the reins
of the stunt horse

01:02:29.947 --> 01:02:31.513
with one hand."

01:02:31.515 --> 01:02:34.816
Do you really think
that's gonna help her career?

01:02:34.818 --> 01:02:36.752
- Well, do you?
- Evan!

01:02:36.754 --> 01:02:39.988
I don't know what you're saying.
Frankly, I don't care.

01:02:39.990 --> 01:02:41.490
This is a very nice scotch.

01:02:41.492 --> 01:02:43.859
I'm sitting here
enjoying myself,

01:02:43.861 --> 01:02:46.795
so why don't you
take your little cushion

01:02:46.797 --> 01:02:48.797
and ram it up your ass?

01:02:50.233 --> 01:02:51.967
Yes! I got the part
of the queen.

01:02:51.969 --> 01:02:53.969
- That's the lead part.
- Congratulations.

01:02:53.971 --> 01:02:55.370
Thank you.

01:02:55.372 --> 01:02:57.773
Looks like I got the old
knight in shining armor.

01:02:57.775 --> 01:02:58.907
Oh, cool.

01:02:58.909 --> 01:03:01.476
Que se dice,
my lovely Nikki?

01:03:01.478 --> 01:03:03.211
Since you're playing the queen,

01:03:03.213 --> 01:03:05.514
you'll have more lines with me
than anyone else.

01:03:05.516 --> 01:03:06.982
Really? Why is that?

01:03:06.984 --> 01:03:09.017
I don't know, Juliet.

01:03:09.019 --> 01:03:11.186
Who do you think would be
the logical philigistic

01:03:11.188 --> 01:03:14.356
for the queen
to have conversilagism?

01:03:14.358 --> 01:03:17.359
- That's not even a word.
- A king.

01:03:17.361 --> 01:03:20.061
Well, I'm a knight
in shining armor,

01:03:20.063 --> 01:03:21.429
and I'd take that any day

01:03:21.431 --> 01:03:24.499
over being an ignorant,
uneducated, lazy king.

01:03:24.501 --> 01:03:26.368
Oh, my god, guys, please.

01:03:26.370 --> 01:03:28.270
That's perfect.

01:03:28.272 --> 01:03:30.906
Then why don't you make like the
cute little knight that you are

01:03:30.908 --> 01:03:33.375
and find something to do
with your time, my brotha?

01:03:33.377 --> 01:03:35.977
Because the king and the queen
have a lot of work to do.

01:03:35.979 --> 01:03:37.879
Come on, Nikki.

01:03:40.316 --> 01:03:43.185
Uccellini!

01:03:43.187 --> 01:03:44.486
Motherfucker.

01:03:44.488 --> 01:03:47.255
- Hey.
- Hey, Hannah.

01:03:47.257 --> 01:03:48.957
- You did a great job tonight.
- Thanks.

01:03:48.959 --> 01:03:51.092
I'll catch up with you
later, okay?

01:03:51.094 --> 01:03:52.227
Are you okay, drew?

01:03:52.229 --> 01:03:54.129
Yup. Top of the world.

01:04:02.605 --> 01:04:04.406
En garde!

01:04:04.408 --> 01:04:05.841
Not today, hansel.

01:04:13.416 --> 01:04:15.483
The lover's identity
has been resurrected.

01:04:19.255 --> 01:04:21.356
Where'd you get Nikki's ID?

01:04:28.598 --> 01:04:31.867
She's probably gonna need this.

01:04:31.869 --> 01:04:34.469
I should probably
take it back to her, right?

01:04:39.108 --> 01:04:41.509
Rubisio: Ooh, yeah.

01:04:41.511 --> 01:04:43.411
Oh! Now your ass
a little bit.

01:04:43.413 --> 01:04:45.447
- Uh-huh.
- Yeah.

01:04:45.449 --> 01:04:48.416
Now look at me
and say, "uccellini."

01:04:48.418 --> 01:04:51.486
Uccellini.

01:04:51.488 --> 01:04:53.588
God, you're so good.

01:04:53.590 --> 01:04:57.092
Oh, baby, put your leg up
on the couch right there.

01:04:57.094 --> 01:04:59.561
Oh, yeah.

01:04:59.563 --> 01:05:01.663
Oh, yeah.

01:05:01.665 --> 01:05:03.331
Ooh.

01:05:03.333 --> 01:05:05.200
Damn, that looks good.

01:05:05.202 --> 01:05:08.336
Oh! Move the robe
a little bit.

01:05:08.338 --> 01:05:09.471
Why?

01:05:09.473 --> 01:05:11.606
What?

01:05:11.608 --> 01:05:13.408
Just move the robe.

01:05:13.410 --> 01:05:15.911
Yeah. Ooh.
The shoulder, I like it.

01:05:19.949 --> 01:05:21.216
Hey, people.

01:05:21.218 --> 01:05:22.484
People.

01:05:22.486 --> 01:05:24.419
Hey! Shut up!

01:05:24.421 --> 01:05:26.388
The director's talking.

01:05:26.390 --> 01:05:28.323
Shouldn't we wait for Nikki
to get here?

01:05:28.325 --> 01:05:30.926
Nikki's gonna be
a little late.

01:05:30.928 --> 01:05:34.262
Really?
Why is that, rubisio?

01:05:34.264 --> 01:05:37.132
Sorry. Hi. What's up?

01:05:38.634 --> 01:05:41.503
I don't know, Nikki.
Why don't you tell me?

01:05:41.505 --> 01:05:43.305
I thought you weren't
that type of girl.

01:05:46.142 --> 01:05:48.376
I can't do this.
I'm done.

01:05:48.378 --> 01:05:50.545
Hey, where you going?

01:05:50.547 --> 01:05:53.949
Drew, don't bail on us.
We need you.

01:05:53.951 --> 01:05:55.617
Yeah, I thought we were
all in this together.

01:05:55.619 --> 01:05:56.618
Where you going?

01:05:59.622 --> 01:06:04.259
Okay. The only reason I joined
this class is to bang her.

01:06:04.261 --> 01:06:05.327
Apparently, she's a whore.

01:06:05.329 --> 01:06:06.995
For the rest of you,

01:06:06.997 --> 01:06:09.531
granny, what are you,
90 years old?

01:06:09.533 --> 01:06:10.966
Wake up.

01:06:10.968 --> 01:06:12.334
And you?

01:06:12.336 --> 01:06:14.369
You can barely
complete a sentence.

01:06:14.371 --> 01:06:16.738
Talking to you is like
dealing with a crack baby.

01:06:16.740 --> 01:06:18.740
I don't wanna say
not no drugs.

01:06:18.742 --> 01:06:20.742
And what,
a fashion designer and a geek

01:06:20.744 --> 01:06:23.211
take over
the entertainment business?

01:06:23.213 --> 01:06:25.447
And you, little guy,

01:06:25.449 --> 01:06:27.449
I don't know
if you got the memo,

01:06:27.451 --> 01:06:29.451
but they already
shot the movie <i> Willow.</i>

01:06:29.453 --> 01:06:31.720
Yeah. You're about
20 years too late.

01:06:31.722 --> 01:06:34.456
You might wanna see if Santa's
still hiring for the season.

01:06:34.458 --> 01:06:35.557
Check that out.

01:06:35.559 --> 01:06:37.459
Oh, with your pterodactyl arms--

01:06:37.461 --> 01:06:38.626
uhh, uhh--

01:06:38.628 --> 01:06:40.996
who's my bitch now?

01:06:40.998 --> 01:06:42.564
- Hey, drew?
- What?

01:06:42.566 --> 01:06:44.366
Go fuck yourself.

01:06:44.368 --> 01:06:47.035
Starmaker academy's a joke.

01:06:47.037 --> 01:06:49.170
We're all bigger jokes
for being here.

01:06:51.607 --> 01:06:54.409
Oh, and everybody knows
you're not Italian.

01:06:54.411 --> 01:06:57.012
Yes, I am.

01:06:57.014 --> 01:06:59.414
I am Italian. Nikki?

01:06:59.416 --> 01:07:00.582
Give it up.

01:07:07.556 --> 01:07:10.592
Guys, what the fuck
is wrong with...

01:07:15.064 --> 01:07:17.599
Sounds like that little Betty
did you dirty, bro.

01:07:17.601 --> 01:07:21.403
Another dude
in the same week, huh?

01:07:21.405 --> 01:07:23.138
That's why I hit and quit.

01:07:23.140 --> 01:07:25.473
No emotions involved,
my friend.

01:07:25.475 --> 01:07:27.509
Hey, can I get you
something to drink?

01:07:27.511 --> 01:07:28.743
Oh, shit.

01:07:28.745 --> 01:07:32.047
You again, huh?
Well, yes.

01:07:32.049 --> 01:07:34.416
I'll have
a cabernet sauvignon.

01:07:34.418 --> 01:07:37.318
- Vodka, please, double.
- Okay.

01:07:37.320 --> 01:07:39.220
You know, Nate,
it'd be one thing

01:07:39.222 --> 01:07:41.089
if she hooked up
with another guy.

01:07:41.091 --> 01:07:44.259
Ohh! Rubisio?
He's just so gross. Ugh!

01:07:44.261 --> 01:07:47.128
Hey, look, I knew it.
I got the gift, my friend.

01:07:47.130 --> 01:07:48.196
The gift?

01:07:48.198 --> 01:07:49.464
Yes, the gift of intuition.

01:07:49.466 --> 01:07:51.332
We could've had
an oreo cookie, brother.

01:07:51.334 --> 01:07:53.701
-Nikki's white.
-I don't give a shit. I'm black.

01:07:53.703 --> 01:07:56.704
Okay, so I got
one double vodka

01:07:56.706 --> 01:07:58.540
and one straight cognac

01:07:58.542 --> 01:08:03.411
with a splash of jungle juice
and a watermelon wedge.

01:08:03.413 --> 01:08:06.514
Watermelon?
Fuck is jungle juice, man?

01:08:08.117 --> 01:08:13.455
Hmmm...

01:08:17.792 --> 01:08:19.094
Come forth.

01:08:22.098 --> 01:08:23.832
Hi, hansel.

01:08:23.834 --> 01:08:26.301
Um, is drew here?

01:08:26.303 --> 01:08:28.269
He is without presence.

01:08:28.270 --> 01:08:30.705
Does that mean
he's not here?

01:08:30.707 --> 01:08:33.675
Do you know
when he'll be back?

01:08:33.676 --> 01:08:34.843
I do not.

01:08:34.845 --> 01:08:38.212
I also do not know
who you are.

01:08:38.215 --> 01:08:41.816
This is Hannah.
She's part of our acting class.

01:08:41.818 --> 01:08:46.888
Ah. I extend my right hand,
and she offers her left.

01:08:46.890 --> 01:08:48.456
Uh, yeah, I'm sorry.

01:08:48.457 --> 01:08:51.693
I can't use my right side
of my body.

01:08:51.694 --> 01:08:55.662
Because you choose not to move
this side of your body.

01:08:55.665 --> 01:08:58.533
No, actually,
it's not by choice.

01:08:58.535 --> 01:09:02.237
A beautiful girl
who is a nonconformist.

01:09:02.238 --> 01:09:05.273
The magnitude
of such copious assertion

01:09:05.274 --> 01:09:08.443
is far too sagacious
for me to comprehend.

01:09:08.444 --> 01:09:11.813
Therefore, I hesitate
to articulate

01:09:11.814 --> 01:09:14.849
with any degree of accuracy.

01:09:23.759 --> 01:09:25.359
Wait.

01:09:27.529 --> 01:09:31.633
I worked my ass off to be
the best actor in this biz,

01:09:31.635 --> 01:09:34.435
but I can't change who I am.

01:09:34.437 --> 01:09:36.371
I can't change
the way I was born.

01:09:36.372 --> 01:09:38.506
I think you just need
to stay positive, Teddy.

01:09:38.508 --> 01:09:40.875
How do you know there's not
a movie being written right now

01:09:40.877 --> 01:09:43.377
about a leading man
who's also a little person?

01:09:43.380 --> 01:09:45.479
What does that have
to do with anything?

01:09:45.482 --> 01:09:48.816
I'm talking about dealing with
the backlash of discrimination.

01:09:48.818 --> 01:09:50.919
Well, as a little person, right?

01:09:50.921 --> 01:09:52.921
No, you idiot,
as a homosexual.

01:09:54.890 --> 01:09:57.625
- Shit!
- Okay, all right.

01:09:57.627 --> 01:10:00.461
When I first started,
i was a total basket of nerves,

01:10:00.463 --> 01:10:02.597
but then I just let
the adrenaline take over

01:10:02.599 --> 01:10:04.832
and unleashed my beast,
just like Evan taught us.

01:10:04.834 --> 01:10:07.902
Oh, god, you guys.
I-i gotta go.

01:10:07.904 --> 01:10:10.672
- What?
- My ex. My ex is in there.

01:10:10.674 --> 01:10:13.241
I can't deal with this
right now.

01:10:13.243 --> 01:10:15.410
I think I know
what you need, Teddy.

01:10:15.412 --> 01:10:17.478
Let me go.

01:10:17.480 --> 01:10:19.514
Yeah?
Tell me to let you go,

01:10:19.516 --> 01:10:21.783
or I'll hold you like this
all day, woman.

01:10:21.785 --> 01:10:24.385
Let go of me,
you asshole.

01:10:24.387 --> 01:10:26.387
I'm warm, I'm warm.

01:10:26.389 --> 01:10:27.789
Freeze, pervert!

01:10:27.791 --> 01:10:29.757
You have three seconds
to put that child down

01:10:29.759 --> 01:10:31.726
or you will be tased!

01:10:31.728 --> 01:10:33.261
You again?

01:10:33.263 --> 01:10:36.497
Oh, shit.
No! What? No!

01:10:36.499 --> 01:10:38.700
First, girl scouts,
now little handicapped boys?

01:10:38.702 --> 01:10:40.401
What? No!

01:10:40.403 --> 01:10:42.337
You are sicker than I thought,
you sick little pervert!

01:10:42.339 --> 01:10:44.672
Teddy, tell them.
It's a misunderstanding.

01:10:44.674 --> 01:10:46.808
Officers, I'm 26 years old.

01:10:46.810 --> 01:10:49.777
He's just helping me so I could
go inside and blow 'em away.

01:10:49.779 --> 01:10:51.246
- What?
- Oh, sweet Jesus.

01:10:51.248 --> 01:10:52.580
It's okay, little boy.

01:10:52.582 --> 01:10:55.450
You don't have
to blow anyone today.

01:10:55.452 --> 01:10:56.784
I'm not a little boy.

01:10:56.786 --> 01:11:00.555
You can go shove that
up your black ass.

01:11:00.557 --> 01:11:02.590
God! Teddy, are you okay?

01:11:02.592 --> 01:11:04.826
Step back
or you will be tased!

01:11:04.828 --> 01:11:06.728
- Who are you?
- My name is Hugo.

01:11:06.730 --> 01:11:08.830
What the hell
are you doing here?

01:11:08.832 --> 01:11:10.431
I was inside just having
my normal vanilla nut latte,

01:11:10.433 --> 01:11:11.899
skinny girl edition,

01:11:11.901 --> 01:11:14.836
and I saw this beast
manhandling my little Teddy.

01:11:14.838 --> 01:11:16.371
Are you this little boy's
father?

01:11:16.373 --> 01:11:17.939
No. He use to be my lover.
He was amazing.

01:11:17.941 --> 01:11:20.275
He would get to places
you never--

01:11:20.277 --> 01:11:21.976
oh, my god.

01:11:23.846 --> 01:11:27.649
You know your friends are gonna
be at that showcase tonight.

01:11:27.651 --> 01:11:30.351
- Apparently.
- You're supposed to be there.

01:11:30.353 --> 01:11:33.821
What do you think they're gonna
say when you don't even show up?

01:11:33.823 --> 01:11:36.491
- How do you think they'll feel?
- Who cares?

01:11:36.493 --> 01:11:38.026
Anything else?

01:11:38.028 --> 01:11:40.795
No, thanks.

01:11:43.399 --> 01:11:44.932
Look, that's messed up, drew.

01:11:44.934 --> 01:11:46.634
If you say
you're gonna do something,

01:11:46.636 --> 01:11:47.969
then, man, you gotta do it.

01:11:47.971 --> 01:11:50.505
All your peeps
are gonna be there

01:11:50.507 --> 01:11:52.607
while you're sitting
at a dive bar.

01:11:55.010 --> 01:11:56.511
Come on.

01:11:58.080 --> 01:11:59.947
Let's go.

01:11:59.949 --> 01:12:01.449
I'll take my watermelon.

01:12:03.352 --> 01:12:05.553
Little boy,
I'll be right back for you.

01:12:05.555 --> 01:12:09.023
We will find your parents
today, sweetheart.

01:12:09.025 --> 01:12:10.892
Don't either of you
move a muscle!

01:12:10.894 --> 01:12:13.428
- Let's go, rookie.
- You gonna pin me down?

01:12:13.430 --> 01:12:16.864
I unleash beast.
Let's go! Hurry up!

01:12:16.866 --> 01:12:18.533
I no wanna miss showcase.

01:12:18.535 --> 01:12:20.802
You guys just go without me.
I can never keep up.

01:12:20.804 --> 01:12:23.604
Yeah, right.
Let's saddle up, dudes.

01:12:23.606 --> 01:12:26.407
Oh, my god, Teddy!
What the hell is happening?

01:12:26.409 --> 01:12:29.444
Stop being such a queen.
I'll be fine. Leave me alone.

01:12:29.446 --> 01:12:31.679
- Where are you going?
- I'm going to the showcase.

01:12:31.681 --> 01:12:34.649
- I gotta unleash my beast.
- Where are you taking him?

01:12:34.651 --> 01:12:36.484
Shut up, Hugo.

01:12:36.486 --> 01:12:38.119
Don't you die on me!

01:12:38.121 --> 01:12:40.054
Okay, I don't even know
how to turn this thing on.

01:12:40.056 --> 01:12:41.756
Honestly, I never driven
one of these.

01:12:41.758 --> 01:12:43.758
I've never even
ridden a bicycle. Shit!

01:12:46.929 --> 01:12:51.366
Ladies and gentleman,
please allow me to introduce

01:12:51.368 --> 01:12:55.970
the one and the only
star-studded ensemble,

01:12:55.972 --> 01:12:58.506
I give to you...

01:12:58.508 --> 01:13:02.777
The starmaker academy!

01:13:19.062 --> 01:13:23.664
Once upon a time
in a land far, far away

01:13:23.666 --> 01:13:26.868
lived a very selfish king.

01:13:26.870 --> 01:13:30.071
I am both intelligent
and handsome.

01:13:30.073 --> 01:13:32.774
Are there any men
greater than me, my loves?

01:13:32.776 --> 01:13:35.643
Your greatness
goes unparalleled, my love.

01:13:35.645 --> 01:13:38.413
You are the greatest king
in all the land.

01:13:38.415 --> 01:13:40.615
And that is why I shall
wed even more wives.

01:13:40.617 --> 01:13:42.617
A male specimen
of this caliber

01:13:42.619 --> 01:13:44.886
shall not be hoarded
by merely three women,

01:13:44.888 --> 01:13:46.988
for I desire more wives.

01:13:46.990 --> 01:13:49.924
May we ask that you
not take another lover,

01:13:49.926 --> 01:13:53.528
for we are beginning to feel
like just a number, my love?

01:13:53.530 --> 01:13:55.196
Asshole.

01:13:57.966 --> 01:13:59.734
Heidi, my queen,

01:13:59.736 --> 01:14:02.670
you have always been
the quiet one in the group.

01:14:02.672 --> 01:14:04.572
I suggest you keep quiet,

01:14:04.574 --> 01:14:06.607
or I'm gonna toss your ass
out of this castle

01:14:06.609 --> 01:14:08.443
and into
the urine-filled streets.

01:14:10.512 --> 01:14:11.679
Cold.

01:14:14.216 --> 01:14:16.517
Why don't you have
a car again, Nate?

01:14:16.519 --> 01:14:21.122
You might find it funny, drew,
but the environment is no joke.

01:14:21.124 --> 01:14:24.192
Let me get off this thing.
Fucking segues.

01:14:26.595 --> 01:14:29.797
One of the king's guardsmen
appears,

01:14:29.799 --> 01:14:33.534
bearing news
of a recent discovery.

01:14:33.536 --> 01:14:37.872
King rubisio,
Grant thy servant Liberty

01:14:37.874 --> 01:14:41.008
to speak freely
to thy greatness.

01:14:41.010 --> 01:14:43.678
Yes, my guardsman,
but first,

01:14:43.680 --> 01:14:46.547
who is the most handsome king
in all of the land?

01:14:46.549 --> 01:14:48.616
You are, king rubisio.

01:14:48.618 --> 01:14:51.586
Though my gate does not swing
in that direction,

01:14:51.588 --> 01:14:54.021
I am confident enough
to compliment.

01:14:55.725 --> 01:14:58.659
Why have you come bothering me
and my lucky concubines?

01:14:58.661 --> 01:15:01.762
Your warriors have returned,
good sir.

01:15:01.764 --> 01:15:04.265
They have come
bringing you a new wife.

01:15:04.267 --> 01:15:06.834
Send them in, my guardsman.

01:15:09.838 --> 01:15:11.539
Hello, my good king.

01:15:11.541 --> 01:15:13.875
We've returned from our travels
and brought to you

01:15:13.877 --> 01:15:16.143
the beautiful woman
in all of the land.

01:15:16.145 --> 01:15:18.646
Whoa. I thought I was
the most beautiful queen.

01:15:18.648 --> 01:15:21.082
Silence!

01:15:21.084 --> 01:15:23.551
Hold this.

01:15:23.553 --> 01:15:27.188
Bring forth the prisoner
and let me examine her myself.

01:15:29.157 --> 01:15:31.225
Well, what do you think?

01:15:31.227 --> 01:15:33.127
Is this object of affection
pretty enough

01:15:33.129 --> 01:15:35.830
for the king of all kings?

01:15:35.832 --> 01:15:37.832
Pretty enough?
Are you serious, rubisio?

01:15:37.834 --> 01:15:39.667
Hannah's way too hot for you.

01:15:39.669 --> 01:15:41.269
She doesn't deserve
a jerk like you.

01:15:41.271 --> 01:15:43.704
Shut up, you idiot.
That's not part of the scene.

01:15:43.706 --> 01:15:45.573
Tell it to someone who cares.

01:15:45.575 --> 01:15:49.644
Warriors, come forth
and put this moron in the hole,

01:15:49.646 --> 01:15:51.979
for he has shown
great disrespect.

01:16:00.623 --> 01:16:02.657
I will wed
this prisoner of love.

01:16:02.659 --> 01:16:05.259
I shall make her
my concubine immediately.

01:16:05.261 --> 01:16:07.194
Bring forth the priest.

01:16:08.864 --> 01:16:10.631
Que se dice, my reverend.

01:16:10.633 --> 01:16:12.066
Good day to you, my king.

01:16:12.068 --> 01:16:15.236
What a beautiful young bride
thee has selected.

01:16:15.238 --> 01:16:16.971
You are a lucky king.

01:16:16.973 --> 01:16:18.773
I am a deserving king.

01:16:18.775 --> 01:16:20.608
Now begin the ceremony,

01:16:20.610 --> 01:16:24.011
for I am growing increasingly
anxious to bed down my new wife.

01:16:26.048 --> 01:16:29.016
Please, king,
have mercy on me,

01:16:29.018 --> 01:16:30.885
for I love another man.

01:16:30.887 --> 01:16:34.789
It is he I wish to live happily
ever after with, not you.

01:16:34.791 --> 01:16:36.257
Silence!

01:16:36.259 --> 01:16:38.993
You are now mine,
and you will forever be mine.

01:16:38.995 --> 01:16:41.996
Continue with the ceremony now.

01:16:41.998 --> 01:16:44.365
If no one objects to these two
wedding this day--

01:16:44.367 --> 01:16:46.300
unhand her!

01:16:46.302 --> 01:16:50.071
Unhand my beautiful wife,
you filthy king,

01:16:50.073 --> 01:16:52.139
for I have traveled
a fortnight

01:16:52.141 --> 01:16:54.909
to fend off
this ferocious king.

01:16:54.911 --> 01:16:59.380
But now as I stand before you,
you are no king,

01:16:59.382 --> 01:17:03.284
for you are
an insecure coward.

01:17:11.194 --> 01:17:12.693
Enough.

01:17:12.695 --> 01:17:14.161
I said enough.

01:17:15.964 --> 01:17:17.832
Shut up!

01:17:17.834 --> 01:17:19.300
What are you guys doing?

01:17:19.302 --> 01:17:20.735
That's not even
part of the scene.

01:17:20.737 --> 01:17:22.169
You're gonna ruin this shit.

01:17:25.408 --> 01:17:28.309
I now declare
each and every one of you

01:17:28.311 --> 01:17:30.244
a free member in society.

01:17:30.246 --> 01:17:32.013
Live and let live.

01:17:32.015 --> 01:17:34.348
Shall we rejoice?

01:17:42.658 --> 01:17:45.092
Come forth and fight me
for your love.

01:17:45.094 --> 01:17:46.661
Ooh!

01:17:46.663 --> 01:17:48.429
Come fight me
for what you think you deserve!

01:18:01.977 --> 01:18:03.411
Uccellini!

01:18:04.413 --> 01:18:06.247
Hansel.

01:18:13.855 --> 01:18:15.690
Thank you, kind sir.

01:18:15.692 --> 01:18:17.391
What the fuck, drew?

01:18:17.393 --> 01:18:19.260
Go fuck yourself.

01:18:42.150 --> 01:18:43.184
Ow.

01:18:43.186 --> 01:18:45.186
You know jujitsu?

01:18:45.188 --> 01:18:47.855
This is meditative
mixed martial arts.

01:18:47.857 --> 01:18:49.790
Now relax.

01:18:51.326 --> 01:18:52.893
Eee!

01:18:52.895 --> 01:18:54.395
Yeah!

01:18:54.397 --> 01:18:56.964
And it came to pass,

01:18:56.966 --> 01:19:00.267
hansel had defeated
the evil king.

01:19:00.269 --> 01:19:06.107
The darkness had moved out
and made way for the sunshine.

01:19:06.109 --> 01:19:09.343
A new day has arrived!

01:19:09.345 --> 01:19:11.812
The end!

01:19:47.950 --> 01:19:50.351
what are you doing?

01:19:56.324 --> 01:19:58.159
Hugo: Ah.

01:19:58.161 --> 01:20:00.327
Hugo, baby,
thank you so much for coming.

01:20:00.329 --> 01:20:02.196
Teddy, that was glorious.

01:20:02.198 --> 01:20:05.032
I swear, I believed
you were a lumberjack.

01:20:05.034 --> 01:20:06.400
- Really?
- Oh, my goodness.

01:20:06.402 --> 01:20:07.835
It was just...

01:20:07.837 --> 01:20:09.937
I told you that class
is like amazing.

01:20:09.939 --> 01:20:11.872
I didn't mean to hurt you.
I really didn't.

01:20:11.874 --> 01:20:13.374
- I forgive you.
- Yeah?

01:20:13.376 --> 01:20:14.809
The point is
that you're here now.

01:20:14.811 --> 01:20:16.510
Yeah, all right.

01:20:16.512 --> 01:20:18.546
You just mean so much to me,
honestly, like--

01:20:18.548 --> 01:20:21.048
hey, you all have three seconds
to get on the ground

01:20:21.050 --> 01:20:22.283
or you will be tased!

01:20:22.285 --> 01:20:24.485
- No one move!
- Him again.

01:20:24.487 --> 01:20:26.821
- What's your explanation, boy?
- I have no explanation!

01:20:26.823 --> 01:20:28.489
And who's this young lady
behind you?

01:20:28.491 --> 01:20:30.858
- She's my girlfriend.
- Don't lie to me, boy!

01:20:30.860 --> 01:20:32.426
You can't get something
that hot!

01:20:32.428 --> 01:20:34.895
I swear to god.
She's my girlfriend. Tell him!

01:20:34.897 --> 01:20:36.530
- I don't know him.
- What the fuck?

01:20:36.532 --> 01:20:39.433
- How much did you pay her?
- It's on, it's on.

01:20:44.439 --> 01:20:47.308
All rise for
the honorable judge Martinez.

01:20:47.310 --> 01:20:50.945
<i> Drew: These geniuses were</i>
<i> charged with Grand Theft Auto.</i>

01:20:50.947 --> 01:20:53.447
<i> Luckily for them,</i>
<i> I finally passed the bar exam.</i>

01:20:53.449 --> 01:20:55.216
You may be seated.

01:20:55.218 --> 01:20:58.452
Hey, drew. Tell the judge
to go fuck himself.

01:20:58.454 --> 01:21:01.222
No, don't do that.
Don't tell him that.

01:21:01.224 --> 01:21:04.625
Hello, your honor.
In today's case, 1009,

01:21:04.627 --> 01:21:07.494
<i> the people versus</i>
<i> starmaker academy,</i>

01:21:07.496 --> 01:21:10.364
we'd like to enter
a plea of not guilty.

01:21:12.534 --> 01:21:14.935
<i> Drew: And had them demoted.</i>

01:21:14.937 --> 01:21:16.470
I know!

01:21:16.472 --> 01:21:18.339
It's all because of you.

01:21:18.341 --> 01:21:23.477
This is all your fault,
we're in this situation.

01:21:23.479 --> 01:21:26.380
- I told you, I told you.
- This one's no good.

01:21:26.382 --> 01:21:29.650
<i> Boulevard horny,</i>
scene donkey dick, take three.

01:21:29.652 --> 01:21:32.419
<i> Drew: Teddy finally got</i>
<i> his anger under control...</i>

01:21:32.421 --> 01:21:34.622
Hey.

01:21:34.624 --> 01:21:37.157
<i> ...once he found</i>
<i> his true calling.</i>

01:21:37.159 --> 01:21:40.361
Okay, I think he's ready.
Let's bring in the real talent.

01:21:40.363 --> 01:21:43.464
I am the real talent.

01:21:45.333 --> 01:21:49.503
- No, no, no, no.
- Are you ready for me, big boy?

01:21:49.505 --> 01:21:52.606
Teddy: I think he's still
too cold.

01:21:52.608 --> 01:21:55.542
I want you to take his ass
outside and warm it up.

01:21:57.913 --> 01:22:00.547
Time to warm your ass up,
bitch boy.

01:22:03.518 --> 01:22:05.519
That dick looks good
on you, girl.

01:22:05.521 --> 01:22:08.555
And action!

01:22:10.559 --> 01:22:13.160
<i> Drew: And rubisio?</i>

01:22:13.162 --> 01:22:16.497
<i> Well, let's just say</i>
<i> Karma is alive and well.</i>

01:22:16.499 --> 01:22:18.065
Ugh.

01:22:21.636 --> 01:22:23.437
Hey, Charles,

01:22:23.439 --> 01:22:27.074
I think we just found
the new face for our company.

01:22:27.076 --> 01:22:31.545
Nikki morehead.
Find her.

01:22:31.547 --> 01:22:33.414
<i> Nikki became</i>
<i> the official spokesmodel</i>

01:22:33.416 --> 01:22:35.249
<i> for non-virgin airlines.</i>

01:22:35.251 --> 01:22:38.118
Hannah! I thought
we were meeting at sag.

01:22:38.120 --> 01:22:40.955
Yeah, I figured I'd pick you up.
That way we can carpool.

01:22:40.957 --> 01:22:44.458
- Besides, I missed you.
- Thanks, babe.

01:22:44.460 --> 01:22:47.494
<i> All in all, I'd call this</i>
<i> a happy ending.</i>

01:22:47.496 --> 01:22:49.396
Mm-mm-mm.

01:22:49.398 --> 01:22:50.597
