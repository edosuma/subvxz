00:01.929 --> 00:04.559
- Previously:
- I have a roommate. He's a ghost.

00:05.530 --> 00:07.950
- He got sucked into the portal.
- They made me ruler.

00:10.929 --> 00:14.089
Handsome man
saved me from the monsters.

00:15.130 --> 00:16.809
- He's here.
- Angel.

00:16.929 --> 00:18.300
I'd love to see that boy.

00:26.530 --> 00:30.109
Get dressed and get out because the
next time I see you, I'll kill you.

00:44.530 --> 00:46.990
I understand people who drink too much.

00:47.530 --> 00:52.479
I understand people who say the
parking meter is broken when it's not.

00:53.530 --> 00:55.740
I don't understand people
who worship demons.

00:55.929 --> 00:58.530
Yeah, especially a Lurite demon.
The stink on that thing.

00:58.929 --> 01:01.600
You're a prince of the underworld,
take a Jacuzzi sometime.

01:02.530 --> 01:05.090
It's sad. The only way some
people can find a purpose...

01:05.530 --> 01:07.560
...is by becoming
obsessed with demons.

01:09.129 --> 01:12.079
By the way, Gunn, technically that
wasn't a Lurite, it was Murite.

01:12.730 --> 01:13.959
Subspecies of the Lurite.

01:14.530 --> 01:17.969
The male sports a small telltale fin
just behind the third shoulder.

01:18.730 --> 01:20.730
Glad we're not the sad,
obsessed people.

01:21.129 --> 01:24.250
We have to be a little obsessed.
We specialize in these things.

01:24.730 --> 01:25.709
But we're not sad.

01:26.530 --> 01:31.200
No, we're a happy and rambunctious
lot if I ever saw one.

01:31.930 --> 01:33.750
Not going to humor me
even a little, huh?

01:34.329 --> 01:35.659
Uh-uh.

01:35.530 --> 01:38.409
I realize we sacrifice a great deal
of our social lives...

01:39.129 --> 01:41.159
...but we have to. Work demands it.

01:41.530 --> 01:45.810
True. Who's got time for love when
you're out doing it with the demons?

01:46.930 --> 01:49.280
- Didn't that come out sad and wrong?
- Yeah.

01:49.329 --> 01:52.810
I need to get out more. Speaking of,
anybody talk to Fred lately?

01:53.530 --> 01:57.920
Not talk. Glimpsed. She pokes her head
out of her room once in a while.

01:58.930 --> 02:00.049
Nice girl.

02:00.129 --> 02:03.079
Nice. But not making the giant
strides toward mental health.

02:03.730 --> 02:06.079
She's been hibernating up there
for three months.

02:06.730 --> 02:09.889
Ever since Angel went away.
She's become quite attached to him.

02:10.330 --> 02:13.000
Angel groupie. I get that.
He rescued her from Pylea.

02:13.930 --> 02:15.610
I miss Pylea.

02:15.729 --> 02:17.979
I would think you might.
You were there a week...

02:18.729 --> 02:19.889
...they made you queen.

02:19.930 --> 02:23.830
Fred was there five years.
She was a slave, a runaway.

02:24.729 --> 02:26.590
They nearly chopped her head off.

02:27.129 --> 02:29.550
All those years she spent
hiding out in that cave.

02:29.530 --> 02:31.180
She survived. Girl's strong.

02:31.930 --> 02:34.560
Girl's trading one cave for another.

02:34.930 --> 02:36.509
How strong is that?

02:37.330 --> 02:39.860
- When Angel comes back--
- When is he getting back?

02:40.930 --> 02:43.030
- After working through grief.
- Buff--

02:43.330 --> 02:45.189
Don't say the B word.

02:45.729 --> 02:48.710
The B word was the love of his life.
And he's, what, 250?

02:49.330 --> 02:50.560
That ain't no short life.

02:51.129 --> 02:53.409
It's gonna take more
than a vacation in Sri Lanka.

02:53.530 --> 02:56.789
It isn't a vacation, it's a
spiritual retreat at a monastery.

02:57.729 --> 03:00.990
Angel and a bunch of monks in the
middle of nowhere. There's a party.

03:01.330 --> 03:03.259
Should've got hammered
and gone to Vegas.

03:03.729 --> 03:08.539
He doesn't need a lap dance, he needs
peace and quiet to work through this.

05:00.850 --> 05:02.850
So whose turn is it to set the traps?

05:03.850 --> 05:05.850
- His.
- His.

05:06.250 --> 05:09.370
You amaze me. You'll fight hell beasts,
but you're scared of rats.

05:09.850 --> 05:12.689
- I hate rats. Their beady eyes....
- And their beady teeth.

05:13.449 --> 05:16.540
And their tails all:

05:17.050 --> 05:20.949
Well, aren't you two just the
biggest scaredies I ever saw--

05:26.050 --> 05:28.079
You're back!

05:30.850 --> 05:32.949
You guys, he's back!

05:33.850 --> 05:36.589
- Wesley.
- Welcome home.

05:36.850 --> 05:39.480
Hey, what's up, man?

05:40.449 --> 05:43.540
So, I hope you had a good retreat,
all peaceful and meditatey.

05:44.050 --> 05:46.819
It was all right until the monks
turned out to be demons.

05:48.250 --> 05:49.720
- Vegas.
- Yeah.

05:50.050 --> 05:53.069
Well, the point is,
you worked on things.

05:53.649 --> 05:56.949
It wasn't like a holiday where you'd
come back home to your friends...

05:57.250 --> 06:00.160
...you know, with some small
mementos of your trip.

06:00.850 --> 06:03.019
- Fishing for gifts?
- Yes.

06:03.850 --> 06:05.110
Oh....

06:05.649 --> 06:08.420
A small human head.

06:09.250 --> 06:10.579
Cool.

06:12.850 --> 06:16.079
Oh, my gosh. It's gorgeous!

06:17.050 --> 06:19.300
And look how it brings out my breasts.

06:20.649 --> 06:22.230
You know you were all thinking it.

06:23.050 --> 06:24.800
- Oh.
- Thank you.

06:24.850 --> 06:27.480
Sixteenth century....

06:29.050 --> 06:32.560
Murshan Dynasty?
I've always wanted one of these.

06:33.250 --> 06:34.480
I didn't think....

06:35.050 --> 06:38.980
I can't wait to kill something with it.
Any visions brewing?

06:39.850 --> 06:41.389
Place looks good.

06:41.649 --> 06:43.439
How's Fred?

06:44.050 --> 06:48.230
- Good. She's doing well.
- Hasn't come out of her room?

06:49.449 --> 06:53.560
Not what you'd call frequently.
We send up a lot of tacos.

06:54.250 --> 06:57.899
I'll settle in and check on her,
then you guys can bring me up to date.

06:59.649 --> 07:02.319
It's really good to see you guys.

07:04.449 --> 07:05.389
Thanks for the head.

07:05.649 --> 07:08.000
He seems better than when he left.

07:10.449 --> 07:12.199
Uh-huh.

07:20.889 --> 07:23.730
Listen. Listen.

07:28.689 --> 07:31.529
Oh, hi, how are you?
I'm just fine.

07:32.290 --> 07:35.839
Doing real good here. No need to worry
about me, but thanks for checking.

07:36.490 --> 07:38.240
It's me, Fred.

07:38.889 --> 07:40.470
Angel.

07:40.689 --> 07:45.680
Hey! Hey, you're--
Well, hey, there.

07:47.290 --> 07:49.819
It's good to-- Did you have a nice--?

07:50.290 --> 07:52.540
Oh, here, let me
make some room.

07:52.689 --> 07:53.600
I can't come in.

07:53.889 --> 07:57.329
Of course. You're worn from your trip.
You go rest. We'll catch up later.

07:58.089 --> 07:59.879
I just can't come in unless you--

08:00.490 --> 08:04.000
I invite you, instead of being rude.

08:04.689 --> 08:08.620
Oh, come in, come in.

08:11.889 --> 08:15.120
It's just a smidge of vampire in you,
as far as I'm concerned.

08:16.089 --> 08:17.910
But the universe has rules.

08:18.490 --> 08:21.579
I'm a big believer in rules
and theorems, formulas.

08:22.089 --> 08:25.529
- I get that.
- Aphorisms leave me a little dry.

08:25.689 --> 08:27.509
How are you?

08:29.290 --> 08:31.889
Yeah, good.

08:32.289 --> 08:34.990
Everything's pretty much
like when you...

08:35.289 --> 08:37.850
...you know, went away on your trip.

08:38.889 --> 08:41.169
- Sorry I left so suddenly--
- Hey, no.

08:41.289 --> 08:43.320
You had things you had
to take care of...

08:43.690 --> 08:47.799
...and I don't need a babysitter or--
You're sticking around now, right?

08:49.090 --> 08:51.090
Yeah, I am.

08:52.090 --> 08:53.909
Good.

08:55.090 --> 08:59.090
"Listen, listen."
What are you listening for?

09:00.490 --> 09:02.379
The click.

09:05.889 --> 09:08.309
When it all comes together
and makes sense...

09:08.889 --> 09:12.220
...there's a click in your brain
and you understand things again.

09:13.090 --> 09:16.879
What happens if you run out of
wall space before you get the click?

09:17.289 --> 09:20.169
I don't know.

09:20.889 --> 09:24.299
Fred, you know, you spent...

09:26.889 --> 09:31.490
...five years in a place
where humans...

09:32.289 --> 09:34.850
...could only be slaves or fugitives.

09:35.289 --> 09:39.220
I know that wasn't a picnic for you,
but you're home now.

09:40.090 --> 09:43.809
You're safe.
You can come out of your room.

09:46.090 --> 09:48.690
I know it's gonna take some time.

09:49.090 --> 09:52.320
Time? I have a whole treatise on that.

09:52.690 --> 09:56.690
It seems to take a lot of it to do
just about anything these days.

09:59.289 --> 10:01.080
Fred. Fred.

10:01.690 --> 10:04.320
Fred, you don't have to write
absolutely everything down.

10:04.690 --> 10:08.799
Oh, right. God, I should
write that down.

10:09.490 --> 10:14.690
You just need to take
some small steps.

10:17.289 --> 10:18.549
Huh?

10:20.289 --> 10:24.470
Like coming downstairs...

10:25.690 --> 10:27.200
...and hanging with us for a while.

10:28.090 --> 10:30.620
What do you say?
Nothing to be scared of.

10:31.090 --> 10:34.000
You're safe here in the hotel.

10:35.889 --> 10:38.559
Hold that thought.

10:51.409 --> 10:53.200
What is it? What do you see?

10:53.809 --> 10:58.230
A bunch of vampires,
and they're crashing a party.

10:59.210 --> 11:00.789
- They're killing people.
- Where?

11:01.009 --> 11:04.490
Wilson College. Bonner Hall.

11:05.210 --> 11:07.350
- Room 918.
- 918.

11:07.610 --> 11:09.639
They're gonna take hostages.

11:10.009 --> 11:11.870
Watch out for the blond.
She's the worst.

11:12.409 --> 11:16.309
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, I'm fine. Go, go!

11:32.809 --> 11:35.830
- So much for inviting everyone.
- Some of them are still alive.

11:36.409 --> 11:39.460
There's been an accident.
We need two, maybe three ambulances.

11:40.610 --> 11:43.629
Wilson College, Bonner Hall,
Room 918. Hurry.

11:43.610 --> 11:45.259
They're heading east.
Take the car.

11:46.009 --> 11:47.309
What are you gonna do?

11:50.809 --> 11:52.460
Oh.

12:01.570 --> 12:04.129
- Please....
- Huh?

12:05.169 --> 12:07.100
Please don't hurt her.

12:09.370 --> 12:11.159
You love her?

12:12.970 --> 12:15.429
You'd do anything for her.

12:17.169 --> 12:21.070
What if we just kill her
and let you go?

12:22.570 --> 12:24.039
Huh?

12:27.370 --> 12:30.809
Come on now.
Life's about making choices.

12:31.570 --> 12:34.200
You or her?
What's it gonna be?

12:39.970 --> 12:43.409
Her. Take her. Oh, God....

12:45.370 --> 12:47.509
Gee, Bobby, you call that love?

12:47.769 --> 12:50.509
We get home,
I'll show you what love is.

12:59.769 --> 13:01.139
Run!

13:32.169 --> 13:33.960
Angelus?

14:03.049 --> 14:04.980
Too bright. Too bright.

14:08.450 --> 14:10.840
Thank you, Dennis.

14:11.450 --> 14:14.220
How did I ever live without a ghost?

14:25.250 --> 14:27.600
Hot. Really hot, please.

14:36.649 --> 14:41.710
These visions are killing me.
It's getting worse every time.

15:07.850 --> 15:11.610
Oh, Dennis, what would
I do without you?

15:21.049 --> 15:23.049
No....

15:37.929 --> 15:39.649
- Young love.
- Give it a century.

15:39.730 --> 15:41.870
A century? A mere hundred years?

15:42.129 --> 15:44.480
I'd need 1000 to sketch
the plane of your face.

15:45.129 --> 15:47.409
I would need 10,000
to name the color of your eyes.

15:48.129 --> 15:50.379
They're green, but take your time.
In fact, don't.

15:50.529 --> 15:53.370
We have a ship to catch,
and Holtz may not be far behind.

15:54.129 --> 15:56.019
You know neither poetry
nor love, Angelus.

15:56.529 --> 16:00.389
He knows other things.
Marvellously vile and ripping things.

16:01.330 --> 16:03.330
- Didn't we eat a poet in Madrid?
- Troubadour.

16:03.730 --> 16:07.240
Everything's closed. Pity. I wanted to
spend some of the count's gold on you.

16:07.929 --> 16:09.230
We need it for the voyage.

16:09.730 --> 16:13.059
The Count de Leon was a little rich
for my blood. I'll be full for a week.

16:13.330 --> 16:15.360
- The fire was excessive.
- Of course it was.

16:15.730 --> 16:18.500
- We burnt his villa to the ground.
- We made a statement.

16:19.330 --> 16:21.860
A statement, as in, "Here we are,
Holtz. Hunt us down."

16:22.330 --> 16:24.539
Oh, who cares about Holtz?

16:25.330 --> 16:27.750
You would if you knew him.
He's killed scores of us.

16:27.730 --> 16:29.620
Hunted Angelus and I across Europe.

16:30.730 --> 16:34.029
God, he follows us to Morocco,
what then? The New World?

16:34.929 --> 16:37.950
- I say we stay and fight the bastard.
- Yeah, but you're an idiot.

16:38.529 --> 16:41.509
I don't think he's the most formidable
vampire-killer in the world.

16:42.730 --> 16:46.659
"None lives to tell the tale"
and all. You lived to tell the tale.

16:46.929 --> 16:49.419
I heard he trapped you
both in a barn...

16:49.929 --> 16:52.840
...and you fled, leaving him to die.

16:53.529 --> 16:55.600
- It's not true?
- It's entirely true.

16:55.929 --> 17:00.639
She hit me with a shovel, wished me
luck and rode off on our only horse.

17:01.929 --> 17:06.740
- Life's full of surprises.
- Life's dull. You're full of surprises.

17:07.329 --> 17:09.150
When he finally did
catch me in Vienna...

17:09.730 --> 17:13.519
...I had to pay for my sins.
Again and again.

17:13.930 --> 17:17.019
Can you even begin to fathom
the things we did?

17:17.529 --> 17:19.210
Course not. You're in love.

17:22.930 --> 17:25.210
Let's not dawdle, children.

17:25.930 --> 17:27.118
It's so pretty.

17:28.329 --> 17:29.660
No, it's not.

17:30.130 --> 17:33.640
- James?
- Not as pretty as it's going to be...

17:36.730 --> 17:40.210
...when it's worn by
the prettiest one of all.

17:42.130 --> 17:44.299
I adore it. I'll never take it off.

17:49.930 --> 17:51.509
This is where love gets you.

17:52.930 --> 17:55.740
Elisabeth, you and Darla
get to the ship. We'll join you there.

17:58.930 --> 18:00.720
Let's give them a rout,
what do you say?

18:01.329 --> 18:03.960
I'd say you're an idiot,
but I'd just be repeating myself.

18:04.930 --> 18:08.019
Bloody frogs! I broke the
window, and I'll break your skulls!

18:10.930 --> 18:13.250
See, all you have to do
is stand up to them.

18:13.930 --> 18:16.349
What are you afraid of?

18:18.130 --> 18:20.019
Not us.

18:31.329 --> 18:32.730
Hope she treasures that locket.

18:34.329 --> 18:36.400
- Then what?
- Huh?

18:36.730 --> 18:39.119
- What happened with Holtz?
- Oh, that's another story.

18:39.730 --> 18:41.450
- We got time.
- I'm not sure we do.

18:42.130 --> 18:44.549
No, because James and Elisabeth
had the forever love.

18:45.130 --> 18:47.900
If he's still around
and he finds out who killed her--

18:48.130 --> 18:50.829
- He'll want revenge.
- If he's around and they're in love.

18:51.730 --> 18:53.940
- It was a long time ago.
- 200-plus years...

18:54.130 --> 18:55.640
...and she's still got the locket.

18:55.930 --> 18:58.559
Gunn and I'll hit the streets.
See what our sources know.

18:59.529 --> 19:01.779
Uh-huh. See?
We have sources now.

19:01.930 --> 19:04.180
- You're almost like real detectives.
- Hey.

19:04.930 --> 19:08.089
Just kidding.
You should probably check it out.

19:08.529 --> 19:10.460
- James really lived for that girl.
- Yeah.

19:27.130 --> 19:30.890
We did all we could, but they were....
He was too much for us.

19:31.329 --> 19:35.680
- Angelus.
- One of our own hunting us. It's sick.

19:36.730 --> 19:38.619
How is it possible?
The Angelus I knew--

19:39.130 --> 19:43.630
He's not the same. Gypsies cursed him
with a soul 100 years ago or so.

19:43.930 --> 19:47.049
He's got a business here in L.A.
He kills us for money.

19:49.329 --> 19:50.940
She's gone.

19:51.130 --> 19:54.079
It was horrible. She was bringing
you two ripe and rosy humans...

19:54.730 --> 19:57.359
...and he just flew out of the sky--

19:57.730 --> 19:59.980
- And you ran.
- No, I fought.

20:00.730 --> 20:02.519
Till I saw it was hopeless.

20:02.529 --> 20:06.039
I thought you wanted to know
how it happened. Who did it.

20:06.730 --> 20:08.799
And now I do.

20:09.730 --> 20:12.009
You want to be alone.

20:13.930 --> 20:17.160
No. I want to die.

20:35.009 --> 20:36.519
What?

20:36.809 --> 20:38.630
- What?
- What do you want to say?

20:39.210 --> 20:41.309
Me? Nothing.
What makes you think I want--?

20:41.609 --> 20:44.000
Because I know you.

20:44.609 --> 20:48.299
- It's really none of my business.
- And that always stops you.

20:49.410 --> 20:53.380
It is my business because we're
trying to do a job here...

20:54.210 --> 20:56.630
...and what affects
you affects me...

20:56.609 --> 21:00.049
...and anyway, I don't like to see
you suffer more than you have to.

21:00.809 --> 21:04.000
I don't think you should blame
yourself or feel guilty for her death.

21:05.009 --> 21:06.480
I don't.

21:06.809 --> 21:09.900
Good. Glad to hear it.

21:10.410 --> 21:13.430
I didn't even know who
she was when I killed her.

21:14.009 --> 21:17.029
Not her. Angel....

21:18.809 --> 21:20.559
Oh.

21:20.609 --> 21:22.150
You want to talk about--

21:23.009 --> 21:25.680
She was the love of your life,
and she died.

21:32.609 --> 21:36.680
And you weren't there
when it happened.

21:38.609 --> 21:41.140
You couldn't help her fight.

21:41.609 --> 21:43.859
You couldn't save her.

21:49.410 --> 21:51.829
You couldn't die with her.

21:57.809 --> 22:01.500
This is gonna be one of those talks
where I do all the talking, isn't it?

22:03.210 --> 22:05.069
Well, I'm not gonna pry.

22:05.609 --> 22:07.930
It's not my style.
Okay, it's totally my style...

22:08.009 --> 22:10.109
...but I'm not getting anywhere
right now.

22:11.009 --> 22:15.150
But you have to tell me one thing.
You owe me this much.

22:15.809 --> 22:17.109
What happened with Holtz?

22:21.210 --> 22:22.859
- Where is she?
- How's your health?

22:23.609 --> 22:26.490
- Mine's grand. Thanks for asking.
- Where is she?

22:26.609 --> 22:28.259
He wants Darla. A thorn in his side.

22:29.009 --> 22:31.750
What we did to his family.
Tasty. Especially the little ones.

22:32.009 --> 22:34.430
Your wife, she kept repeating on us.

22:35.009 --> 22:38.170
Of course, you know, I repeated
on her a few times myself.

22:47.009 --> 22:49.289
There are worse things
than death, Angelus.

22:49.410 --> 22:52.180
I can keep you alive for months,
years, if I've a mind to.

22:53.009 --> 22:56.940
Now, you are going
to tell me where she is.

22:57.809 --> 23:01.430
I am going to tell you. Who's arguing?
I don't want to suffer needlessly.

23:03.809 --> 23:05.950
- She's with his lass.
- Shut your mouth, coward!

23:06.809 --> 23:08.769
He's in love.
It's all very passionate.

23:09.210 --> 23:11.670
How about I give you him
and the women?

23:12.809 --> 23:14.529
- Down at the docks.
- I'll kill you!

23:17.609 --> 23:19.079
Kill them!

23:23.609 --> 23:28.279
Stop them! Stop them, you idiots!
They're getting away! Fan out!

23:44.609 --> 23:45.839
I think we lost them.

23:47.609 --> 23:49.930
I'd kill you if I didn't
have to get to Elisabeth.

23:50.009 --> 23:52.819
I'm laying here with arrows
in me, saving your life.

23:53.609 --> 23:56.559
I'll tell Darla the utter
lack of concern you had for her.

23:57.809 --> 24:00.480
Buy her a hat. She loves hats.

24:00.809 --> 24:04.779
Why are people always running off
and leaving me?

24:05.609 --> 24:07.220
Am I a bad bloke?

24:08.009 --> 24:11.339
I don't think so.
Not once you get to know me.

24:13.410 --> 24:15.339
I'm gonna need a doctor.

24:16.410 --> 24:18.509
You can't go in there. He's sloughing.

24:18.809 --> 24:22.599
- Dr. Gregson, I tried to tell him.
- It's all right, Sandy.

24:27.210 --> 24:30.329
I go through this every month,
just like a woman.

24:30.809 --> 24:34.000
So I gather this is
a matter of some urgency.

24:34.410 --> 24:36.369
I need it.

24:38.009 --> 24:39.829
- It?
- The cure.

24:40.410 --> 24:43.569
You're aware of the price?
It's a steep one.

24:44.009 --> 24:45.799
I've already paid it.

24:46.410 --> 24:49.390
All right, then.
Sandy, let's prepare the patient.

24:54.210 --> 24:56.170
Now, James...

24:57.210 --> 24:59.380
...this shouldn't hurt.

25:02.609 --> 25:04.609
Too much.

25:51.450 --> 25:53.200
- He said he had something?
- He did.

25:53.849 --> 25:56.130
- When's he gonna show?
- Anytime now.

25:56.250 --> 25:59.759
You youngsters wanna button it up?
I'm trying to enjoy the show here.

26:00.450 --> 26:04.950
See, that's real singing
there. That's real music.

26:05.849 --> 26:07.009
Okay, pops.

26:07.650 --> 26:08.809
What do you know?

26:52.650 --> 26:54.819
I'm not dealing
if the bloodsucker's around.

26:55.650 --> 26:58.180
- Angel's not here.
- Good. He's always beating me up...

26:58.650 --> 27:00.230
...or hanging me upside down...

27:00.450 --> 27:03.930
...and he never pays up
like he's supposed to.

27:05.250 --> 27:08.440
I could've made a living in Akron.
I never would've come back here.

27:08.849 --> 27:10.039
Tick-tock, Merl.

27:10.650 --> 27:15.950
This thing took more legwork than
I estimated. Price is gonna change.

27:16.650 --> 27:18.750
- Really?
- Yeah.

27:19.650 --> 27:21.160
All right.

27:21.450 --> 27:23.839
Hey. Hey.

27:24.450 --> 27:26.519
Hey, hey, hey.

27:28.049 --> 27:31.279
This guy James you're looking for,
he's alive...

27:31.650 --> 27:34.490
...he's in town, and he knows
what Angel did to his heartthrob.

27:35.250 --> 27:37.460
He's out for blood.

27:39.450 --> 27:41.549
Yeah, do that.
I'll cover this end. Thanks.

27:42.450 --> 27:43.569
- What's up?
- He's alive.

27:43.650 --> 27:46.000
- Wes and Gunn will find him.
- What if they can't?

27:46.650 --> 27:48.019
I know where he'll be headed.

27:48.450 --> 27:51.079
- Here. For you.
- I want you to go home and stay there.

27:51.450 --> 27:52.319
- No.
- Yes.

27:52.650 --> 27:54.579
- Uh-uh.
- Where's my ax? This is all different.

27:55.049 --> 27:57.220
I moved some things
while you were gone.

27:58.049 --> 27:59.910
They were dust catchers.

28:00.450 --> 28:03.680
- Go home.
- I am sticking with you.

28:04.049 --> 28:06.509
I appreciate your courage,
but I don't want you hurt.

28:07.049 --> 28:10.740
I don't either. I go home, he'll come
after me because I'm home alone.

28:11.250 --> 28:13.349
They come after you when you're alone.

28:14.250 --> 28:16.180
Oh, sure, "Cordy, go home,
be a hostage...

28:16.650 --> 28:18.720
...with the torture and the fear
and the tor--"

28:19.049 --> 28:22.599
Will you, just once, do what I tell you
without arguing about everything?

28:23.250 --> 28:24.650
Hurling ax. Basement?

28:25.049 --> 28:29.859
I just know I'd be a lot safer by your
side rather than all alone at home.

28:34.049 --> 28:36.009
Why'd you do it?

28:40.049 --> 28:41.839
Because I had what
you could never have?

28:42.450 --> 28:43.319
Get back!

28:51.450 --> 28:54.430
Angel? I thought I heard company.

28:55.650 --> 28:59.339
I came out of my room.
Small steps, like you said.

29:01.650 --> 29:05.410
- Go back to your room and stay there.
- Okay, then.

29:08.529 --> 29:10.920
I don't know where he is now,
but I know where he was.

29:11.529 --> 29:12.970
- Where?
- Dr. Gregson's.

29:13.329 --> 29:17.019
- What kind of doctor is that?
- A demon kind. A Slod demon.

29:17.529 --> 29:21.220
- Slod demon? What's he do?
- He's a collector.

29:39.730 --> 29:42.220
- I told you to--
- Shut up and stake him!

29:43.329 --> 29:44.869
Oops.

29:45.130 --> 29:48.849
You never loved anyone or anything.

29:49.930 --> 29:51.299
Go to hell.

30:00.730 --> 30:04.450
- Okay. It's all right, It's over.
- Okay.

30:11.529 --> 30:14.230
Over in what sense?

30:31.250 --> 30:34.160
- Shouldn't he be on fire?
- Let's get out of here.

30:38.450 --> 30:41.220
- My coat. It's stuck.
- Leave it.

30:56.450 --> 30:58.029
- Go that way.
- Where are you going?

30:58.250 --> 30:59.190
Go.

31:03.650 --> 31:07.369
Cordy, this way. Hurry up.

31:16.849 --> 31:19.690
Don't stakes through the heart
and sunshine kill you guys?

31:19.849 --> 31:21.180
- He's become--
- Invincible?

31:21.650 --> 31:23.190
Let's not exaggerate.

31:23.450 --> 31:26.150
The ring of Amarra. When you had that,
you were invincible.

31:27.049 --> 31:29.720
- Does he have a ring?
- No.

31:30.650 --> 31:32.539
Did the Amarra people make cuff links?

31:33.049 --> 31:34.700
- There was only one.
- You smashed it!

31:35.450 --> 31:36.920
- Why don't we recriminate later, okay?
- Yes.

31:37.250 --> 31:39.710
Now be quiet.
I think he took the bait.

31:42.049 --> 31:44.470
- Earthquake.
- Subway.

31:45.650 --> 31:48.069
Okay, just the subway.

31:51.049 --> 31:53.680
- Jeez!
- Sorry.

31:54.049 --> 31:56.750
Cordelia, is that you?
Can you hear me?

31:57.650 --> 32:00.740
Huh? What? Say that again.

32:01.250 --> 32:03.569
There's something you have
to know about James.

32:04.250 --> 32:09.200
Oh, he's invincible, is he?
He went to a what?

32:09.650 --> 32:11.609
Slod demon? What's that?

32:12.049 --> 32:15.380
It's some kind of doctor demon
that collects rare organs.

32:16.250 --> 32:20.500
Cut out his heart?
Absolutely cannot be killed.

32:21.049 --> 32:23.789
- Wait, what? How long?
- Six....

32:24.650 --> 32:25.880
Six what?

32:25.849 --> 32:28.799
What? Hello?

32:29.450 --> 32:30.460
No signal.

32:31.849 --> 32:34.970
The guy is invincible, but it only
lasts for so long, then he dies.

32:35.450 --> 32:36.779
How long?

32:37.250 --> 32:40.690
He said-- I don't know.
Six minutes, hours, weeks.

32:40.849 --> 32:42.359
I hate these.
Give me a signal.

32:42.650 --> 32:45.910
That's good news.
All we have to do is wait him out.

32:46.849 --> 32:50.220
Right. We'll just wait here
until we're sure.

32:58.250 --> 33:00.250
Cordy, up there.

33:25.849 --> 33:27.670
What a creep.

33:36.809 --> 33:39.089
Should we get off and double back?
He won't expect it.

33:40.410 --> 33:42.869
Or should we stay put
to the end of the line...

33:43.410 --> 33:45.440
...and get as much distance
between us as poss--

33:45.809 --> 33:46.819
- Shh!
- What?

33:48.809 --> 33:50.529
He couldn't possibly....

33:51.210 --> 33:53.349
Get back. Get back.

33:55.410 --> 33:58.220
Well, this is a new twist
in an old snake.

33:58.410 --> 34:01.009
Is it possible you care about
someone who isn't you?

34:02.009 --> 34:03.170
Don't worry about her.

34:03.809 --> 34:06.930
But if you've changed, if you're not
the man who screwed Darla...

34:07.410 --> 34:08.599
...and couldn't care about her....

34:09.210 --> 34:12.829
Where did you hear...?
Oh, you mean back in the day. Right.

34:13.409 --> 34:15.550
He has changed a lot.

34:15.809 --> 34:18.829
He has a soul now,
and he cares about people.

34:19.409 --> 34:21.659
So you might feel something
when I snap her neck.

34:22.409 --> 34:24.940
Well, it's not like he's losing sleep
with the caring.

34:25.409 --> 34:28.079
Lucky me. Now I can kill
the woman you love.

34:28.409 --> 34:31.320
- No, you can't.
- Are you forgetting who's invincible?

34:32.010 --> 34:34.400
The woman I love is dead.

34:35.610 --> 34:37.400
Who you talking about?

34:38.010 --> 34:41.518
It happened about three months ago.
We try not to say her name too much.

34:44.610 --> 34:46.889
You loved someone?

34:47.610 --> 34:49.539
With all your heart?

34:50.610 --> 34:51.659
Yeah.

34:54.210 --> 34:56.170
No, you didn't.

34:57.210 --> 35:00.510
Because if you had, you wouldn't be
standing here playing games with me.

35:00.809 --> 35:04.599
You wouldn't be able to.
Because when she died...

35:05.610 --> 35:09.369
...when some bastard killed her,
it would have killed everything in you.

35:09.809 --> 35:14.019
- I wouldn't be able to go on living.
- Don't worry, you won't.

35:15.210 --> 35:16.860
She won't, either.

35:17.610 --> 35:18.519
Angel!

35:23.010 --> 35:24.019
Catch him!

35:29.010 --> 35:29.989
Come on.

35:31.409 --> 35:33.480
How's that feel, invincible boy?

35:35.010 --> 35:38.449
This your idea of love, James?
It's not real unless it kills you?

35:39.210 --> 35:43.559
Yeah. What's yours? It's fun as long
as it doesn't cost me anything?

35:44.010 --> 35:45.940
You don't know what love is.

35:51.210 --> 35:55.070
You think you won
just because you're still alive?

35:56.610 --> 36:00.889
I lived. You just existed.

36:21.289 --> 36:22.940
- How's Fred?
- She's all right.

36:23.090 --> 36:27.659
We talked over what happened, and
I think she'll come out any decade now.

36:28.489 --> 36:29.469
And how are you?

36:29.690 --> 36:33.019
- I'm o--
- Don't say okay, please. I know you.

36:34.489 --> 36:37.469
Ever since you came back,
I can tell that something's not right.

36:38.090 --> 36:40.650
And obviously it's not.

36:41.090 --> 36:44.179
Buffy's dead, and I don't
mean to diminish that.

36:44.690 --> 36:46.789
I miss her too.

36:47.090 --> 36:49.650
I just want to say,
I know that James...

36:50.090 --> 36:52.650
...with all his
Romeo and Juliet madness...

36:53.690 --> 36:57.800
...opened up a lot of wounds for you,
but you'll be okay.

36:59.690 --> 37:01.719
I am okay.

37:02.690 --> 37:04.900
Then what's the problem?

37:05.690 --> 37:09.449
That I'm okay.
That losing Buffy didn't kill me.

37:09.889 --> 37:12.210
That I could deal with it.

37:14.690 --> 37:18.340
In all those years,
no one ever mattered.

37:18.889 --> 37:20.920
Not like she did.

37:21.889 --> 37:25.469
And now she's gone. Forever.

37:26.690 --> 37:30.199
- And you're still here.
- Yeah.

37:30.889 --> 37:32.679
It feels like I'm
betraying her somehow.

37:33.289 --> 37:36.800
No. If you were a loser, if you were
a sick, obsessed vampire...

37:37.489 --> 37:41.280
...then you'd go to a Snod demon or
whatever and get your heart cut out.

37:41.690 --> 37:43.199
But you're not.

37:44.090 --> 37:47.250
You're a living, breathing....

37:48.289 --> 37:50.039
Well, living, anyway...

37:50.690 --> 37:54.099
...good guy, who's still fighting
and trying to help people.

37:54.289 --> 37:57.730
And that's not betraying her,
that's honoring her.

37:58.489 --> 38:00.070
You think?

38:00.289 --> 38:04.889
I'm Cordelia. I don't think,
I know. Okay?

38:08.690 --> 38:10.019
Okay.

38:10.489 --> 38:13.260
So can we get back to work now?

38:14.090 --> 38:16.230
Yeah, sure. There's work?

38:17.690 --> 38:20.780
- What do you know about Nester demons?
- They live in walls of homes.

38:21.289 --> 38:24.199
They hatch several times a year.
Do you have to kill the queen?

38:24.889 --> 38:27.170
If you don't, they infest again,
worse than ever.

38:27.889 --> 38:30.030
We killed some in Hancock Park
a few months ago.

38:30.289 --> 38:33.239
- I don't think we got the queen.
- Well, let's go find out.

38:47.690 --> 38:52.500
Sorry it took so long.
He's a very difficult shaman to find.

38:54.289 --> 38:55.159
You can go.

38:55.489 --> 38:57.380
Oh, no, no, no, no.

38:57.889 --> 39:01.610
I thought we'd have a drink
to celebrate.

39:02.090 --> 39:04.340
No, thanks.

39:06.289 --> 39:08.150
Don't be so shy, little one.

39:08.690 --> 39:11.880
You get to know me,
I'm a very nice man.

39:12.889 --> 39:15.840
How much can one little
drink hurt, huh?

39:16.489 --> 39:19.300
- Depends on who's doing the drinking.
- Mm.

39:21.289 --> 39:24.480
I thought you might have a surprise
or two in you.

39:24.889 --> 39:28.050
Well, you know what they say.

39:39.289 --> 39:42.059
Life's full of surprises.
