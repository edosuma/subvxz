see you again after tonight.

I can't do this right now.

anything at all?

14:42.122 --> 14:43.537
her mother again lately.

14:43.675 --> 14:44.918
[Hildie]
What did you tell her

14:45.056 --> 14:47.058
about her mother?

Either way, I wanted to
meet you at the station.

15:29.031 --> 15:32.655
You should not be walking
around here alone, Jonquil.

about this arrangement?

come here and stay with you

16:31.024 --> 16:34.372

going to be a surprise.

for you too.

16:36.892 --> 16:37.893
And a cake.

-My dad.

17:27.391 --> 17:31.119
He's just never seemed
all that comfortable.

17:31.257 --> 17:33.293
-Comfort is overrated.

17:33.431 --> 17:34.398
Where's your mother?

18:34.872 --> 18:37.254
but I've never heard one
like yours.

It's like you have
two hearts,

18:38.634 --> 18:40.257
at least, if not three.

18:43.087 --> 18:45.089
When was the first day
of your last menstruation?

by that, exactly?

Everything private.

Are you doing any of that?

19:13.152 --> 19:14.325
-What if I am?

19:14.463 --> 19:15.637
-You would be assigned
a counselor.

19:15.775 --> 19:16.741
-Okay, then no.

19:16.879 --> 19:18.053
-Can you prove it?

-For sure.

-One last question.

19:26.889 --> 19:27.925
Are you popular?

On a scale of "no one would
miss you if you disappeared"

19:32.723 --> 19:34.863
to "everyone would do
anything

19:35.001 --> 19:37.900
just to be you
even for just one day."

19:41.525 --> 19:43.182

want to be me.

40:07.474 --> 40:11.132
from like, miles away.

40:11.270 --> 40:16.275
She was pulling me
closer and closer.

40:16.414 --> 40:17.898
[girl] Help me.

40:18.036 --> 40:19.520
-I couldn't get to her
though.

40:19.658 --> 40:22.661
I couldn't help her.

40:24.663 --> 40:26.562
We have to find that girl.

40:26.700 --> 40:28.495
Maybe we should
call somebody.

40:28.633 --> 40:33.465
-Don't call anyone, ever.

40:33.603 --> 40:35.605
You're not going to die
from this.

40:35.743 --> 40:38.401
-What is this?

40:38.539 --> 40:40.472
-I call it Forevering.

40:42.716 --> 40:47.479
It's profound
spectral empathy.

40:47.617 --> 40:52.104
You are one in a long line.

40:52.242 --> 40:59.111
We are proxies,
surrogates, mimics,

40:59.249 --> 41:04.772
mirrors.
We turn, we fake,

41:04.910 --> 41:08.155
we follow, we bend,

41:08.293 --> 41:15.542
we shift, we shape,
we tune way in.

41:15.680 --> 41:17.854
-Am I contagious?

41:17.992 --> 41:21.168
[Hildie] No.
It's the other way around.

41:21.306 --> 41:27.485
A kind of...
possession in reverse.

41:27.623 --> 41:33.387
We are women
feeling all the feelings.

41:33.525 --> 41:34.802
-Why us?

41:34.940 --> 41:37.736
[Hildie] It's not just us.
There are others.

41:37.874 --> 41:42.534
Some we know.
Others we don't know.

41:42.672 --> 41:44.640
And we can pass it along,

41:44.778 --> 41:48.298
but that must be done
very judiciously.

41:48.436 --> 41:50.680
It's a very powerful gift

41:50.818 --> 41:53.476
handed down to the women
in this family

41:53.614 --> 41:56.203
on their 18th birthday.

41:56.341 --> 42:01.001
It would have happened to you
without the cake.

42:01.139 --> 42:05.143
That's just fuel
for the fury.

42:07.386 --> 42:08.905
-What can you do?

42:09.043 --> 42:12.012
-I'm quite something...

42:12.150 --> 42:21.021
ferocious, repulsive,
magnificent.

42:21.159 --> 42:24.093
I've been buried alive twice.

42:24.231 --> 42:26.785
-What about my mom?
What was she like?

42:26.923 --> 42:31.963
-Mm... a fiend's fiend.

42:32.101 --> 42:33.412
-Still?

42:33.551 --> 42:35.104
-Still.

42:35.242 --> 42:38.141
-Is this going to
keep happening to me?

42:38.279 --> 42:40.765
-Forever and ever.

43:09.276 --> 43:11.865
-"The neural basis may be
a cell that reacts

43:12.003 --> 43:14.143
"both when
a particular action

43:14.281 --> 43:18.112
"is performed
and when it is observed.

43:19.597 --> 43:22.392
"As for understanding
the functional significance

43:22.530 --> 43:24.809
"of mirror neurons,

43:24.947 --> 43:27.605

just begun."

43:45.312 --> 43:48.211
[gasping]

43:53.147 --> 43:55.080
[Evelyn's voice] Oh, hey.

43:55.218 --> 43:57.013
What are you doing out here?

44:03.675 --> 44:04.918
[gasps]

44:05.056 --> 44:08.059
-There you are.
You fucking bitch!

44:08.197 --> 44:11.062
You lied to us
about fixing that report.

44:11.200 --> 44:15.066
We're all still dead.
We want our money back.

44:18.241 --> 44:21.417
-I had to give Hildie
your money

44:21.555 --> 44:23.350
to replace her toilet.

44:23.488 --> 44:25.283
But I--I can pay you back.

44:25.421 --> 44:26.836
-In cash?

44:26.974 --> 44:29.218
-Not exactly.
What else do you want?

44:29.356 --> 44:31.047
I can get you
anything else you want.

44:31.185 --> 44:33.601
Booze, shoes, jewelry,

44:33.740 --> 44:35.465
makeup, whatever.

44:38.020 --> 44:39.746
-What's that smell?

44:39.884 --> 44:40.988
-I don't know.

44:43.266 --> 44:47.305
-It's Evelyn.
She smells just like Evelyn.

44:49.894 --> 44:51.136
[gasps]

44:52.586 --> 44:55.244
[Burke] [over speaker]
Code Pink. Pale Pink.

44:55.382 --> 44:59.248
All senior girls report
to the gym immediately.

45:02.285 --> 45:03.321
[door closes]

45:08.982 --> 45:10.984
[Hildie] What's new with you?

45:14.642 --> 45:18.060
-Mm. I didn't have
any lunch money today,

45:18.198 --> 45:20.683
so I sold my underwear
to the student teacher

45:20.821 --> 45:22.616
for Civic Engagement.

45:22.754 --> 45:24.929
The blood-stained ones.

45:25.067 --> 45:26.447
I charged double.

45:27.897 --> 45:29.416
-That's not what I meant.

45:34.662 --> 45:36.837
-It's weird.

45:38.390 --> 45:39.909
It's only been
a couple of days

45:40.047 --> 45:46.916
and I've watched my face
turn into another face.

45:47.054 --> 45:51.196
My voice was her voice too.

45:51.334 --> 45:56.995
And I could feel her blood
leaving her body.

45:57.962 --> 45:59.687
And she's alive.

45:59.826 --> 46:01.551
I just don't know
where she is.

46:02.621 --> 46:04.658
-I don't feel
like you're in any pain.

46:04.796 --> 46:07.454
-I'm not in pain, but I'm not
all that interested

46:07.592 --> 46:09.767
in feeling all the feelings.

46:10.871 --> 46:12.804
I don't mind being me.

46:12.942 --> 46:15.289
-You're still you.

46:15.427 --> 46:19.604
All the feelings
are not your feelings.

46:19.742 --> 46:20.985
Not yet.

46:21.123 --> 46:24.609
-I've inherited
turbo-charged empathy.

46:24.747 --> 46:26.645
I'm like
super sensitive now.

46:26.784 --> 46:30.442
So it's kind of
uncomfortable.

46:30.580 --> 46:33.618
-It's been different
for each of us.

46:33.756 --> 46:38.105
Emotional basket-case
is a tremendous asset though,

46:38.243 --> 46:42.006
and when harnessed can be
quite an efficient weapon.

46:42.144 --> 46:44.146
-Show me how to use it.

46:44.284 --> 46:46.907
-You're going to have to
figure this out on your own.

46:47.045 --> 46:51.774
You'll learn it.
You'll learn to work it.

46:51.912 --> 46:54.915
You may or may not
learn to like it.

46:55.053 --> 46:56.468
It's evolved and mutated

46:56.606 --> 47:00.472
so you can surely do tricks
that no one else can do.

47:00.610 --> 47:03.268
There are some limitations,
of course.

47:03.406 --> 47:07.410
Like I said, that's for you
to figure out for yourself.

47:07.548 --> 47:10.862
For me, it requires
reasonable proximity

47:11.000 --> 47:13.037
and a clear path.

47:13.175 --> 47:18.249
If you can see me,
I can feel you.

47:19.250 --> 47:21.597
-Does my dad know
anything about this?

47:21.735 --> 47:24.945
-I don't know exactly
what your dad knows.

47:25.083 --> 47:26.913
Have you talked to him?

47:27.051 --> 47:31.227
-I call.
He doesn't answer.

47:43.067 --> 47:44.551
[suspenseful music]

47:44.689 --> 47:48.003
[gasps, breathes deeply]

47:59.946 --> 48:01.671
[in villain's voice]
I'd fear me...

48:01.809 --> 48:03.363
I'd fuck me...

48:07.712 --> 48:10.542
-She's nothing like you.

48:10.680 --> 48:13.269
I didn't expect that.

48:13.407 --> 48:15.099
Have you talked to her?

48:15.237 --> 48:18.171
-I call. She doesn't answer.

48:18.309 --> 48:19.758
What do I do?

48:19.897 --> 48:24.660
-Get real.
You get really real.

48:24.798 --> 48:28.906
She's here with me
and we're going through it.

48:29.044 --> 48:33.117
You've got to
pull yourself together.

48:33.255 --> 48:34.566
That was the deal.

48:49.374 --> 48:50.789
-Let's try it again,
from the top.

48:50.928 --> 48:52.067
-I wasn't paying attention.

48:52.205 --> 48:52.964
Okay, do it again.
-So, it's up.

48:53.102 --> 48:54.103
-Up.

48:54.241 --> 48:55.001
-[Poppy] Cross.
-Cross.

48:55.139 --> 48:56.830
-Hit and out.

48:56.968 --> 48:58.004
-You're late.

48:58.142 --> 48:59.350
Where the fuck is Aviva?

48:59.488 --> 49:00.765
-Kirk was supposed to
drop her off.

49:00.903 --> 49:01.800
-Who the fuck is Kirk?

49:01.939 --> 49:03.492
-He's so cute.

49:03.630 --> 49:05.977
-He plays football
and basketball and baseball.

49:06.115 --> 49:07.737
And he's a good kisser.

49:07.875 --> 49:10.464
He uses his tongue.
I heard.

49:10.602 --> 49:12.639
-Okay. Well, we're gonna have
to do this without Aviva.

49:12.777 --> 49:15.124
The family just left.
Are you sure about the alarm?

49:15.262 --> 49:16.298
-Yeah. My dad's not
scheduled to fix it

49:16.436 --> 49:17.851
till like next weekend.

49:17.989 --> 49:18.886
-Okay, I'm gonna go in.

49:19.025 --> 49:20.371
You two stay out here.

49:20.509 --> 49:22.028
If anything happens,
you know what to do.

49:22.166 --> 49:23.477
-[Avalon] Mm-hm.
-[Jonny] Okay.

49:23.615 --> 49:25.790
And I have the list of shit
that you want.

49:25.928 --> 49:26.964
After tonight, we're even?

49:27.102 --> 49:28.413
-Yeah.

49:28.551 --> 49:30.622
-Yeah.

49:50.711 --> 49:52.920
-[Avalon] Okay. Come on.
-[Poppy] Okay, let's go.

49:53.059 --> 49:54.163
[Avalon] Okay.

49:58.064 --> 50:00.100
[Poppy] Right here...

50:01.170 --> 50:03.069
cross.

50:03.207 --> 50:04.484
[police siren wailing]

50:04.622 --> 50:06.175
Ace.

50:10.904 --> 50:12.630
[Sterling] What are you two
doing out here?

50:12.768 --> 50:14.770
There's a new curfew.

50:14.908 --> 50:19.361
Earlier today, we found
one of the girls... dead.

50:19.499 --> 50:20.672
We think it's Evelyn Tufts,

50:20.810 --> 50:21.949
but her eyes and teeth
are missing

50:22.088 --> 50:23.641
along with her scalp.

50:23.779 --> 50:25.677
-It wasn't my idea.

50:25.815 --> 50:28.025
-Wasn't my idea either.

50:28.163 --> 50:30.268
-Why don't you two girls
get in the car?

50:30.406 --> 50:32.477
Come on, get in the car.

50:32.615 --> 50:34.652
[both] We've got spirit,
yes, we do.

50:34.790 --> 50:38.483
We've got spirit,
how about you?

[suspenseful music playing]

50:44.938 --> 50:46.008

yes, I do.
-[Sterling] [mocks] I do.

50:47.389 --> 50:48.355
-[both] I've got spirit...

51:32.296 --> 51:35.022
-What do you mean by okay?

51:35.161 --> 51:36.921
-You see
what happened out here?

51:37.059 --> 51:38.543
-What happened out there?

51:38.681 --> 51:40.752
[Sterling]
I apprehended a prowler.

51:40.890 --> 51:47.311
A girl. A dangerous one.
She got away.

51:47.449 --> 51:49.865
-There's a dangerous girl
out there somewhere?

51:52.281 --> 51:53.696

52:20.551 --> 52:22.311
-I already know your name.
I asked around.

52:22.449 --> 52:23.864
-I thought
you might need a doctor,

52:24.002 --> 52:27.523
but seems like you've
already stopped bleeding.

52:31.182 --> 52:32.287
That's somethin'.

52:35.945 --> 52:38.810
-Would it be okay
if I stayed with you?

52:41.330 --> 52:42.814
-Yeah.

52:44.506 --> 52:47.267
[footsteps]

52:51.927 --> 52:53.929
What'd your parents say?

52:54.067 --> 52:55.758
-I told my aunt
that I was having a sleepover

52:55.896 --> 52:57.484
with a new friend.

52:57.622 --> 53:00.004
Will your parents care
that I'm here?

53:00.142 --> 53:01.592
-If my mom even notices you,

53:01.730 --> 53:04.111
she'll just ask
where you live,

53:04.250 --> 53:05.458
what your parents do.

53:07.598 --> 53:11.084
Anyway, they'll be out
for a while.

53:11.222 --> 53:12.741
-Hm.

53:12.879 --> 53:15.122
-They went to a party
for the Mensahs.

53:15.261 --> 53:20.611
They just bought a new house.
It has an indoor pool.

53:20.749 --> 53:22.544
Mrs. Mensah just got
this thing done to her face

53:22.682 --> 53:24.028
that my mom really wants,

53:24.166 --> 53:28.722
so she and my dad went to get
a closer look.

53:28.860 --> 53:31.173
They aren't really friends,
though.

53:31.311 --> 53:33.417
These grownups
just get shit-faced

53:33.555 --> 53:36.282
and complain
about their kids.

53:36.420 --> 53:37.973
-Who would complain
about you?

53:41.563 --> 53:47.293
-Well, my mom will say
that I'm spoiled and bitchy.

53:47.431 --> 53:48.949
My dad won't correct her.

53:51.228 --> 53:52.884
-You still need
that coat hanger?

53:54.265 --> 53:55.646
-No.

54:00.582 --> 54:02.239
Are you gonna
freak out again?

54:05.621 --> 54:08.383
-Oh, I am definitely
going to freak out again.

-A mouthful of strawberry
bubblegum and Red Hots,

and drying up?

in the backyard last night.

you should do alone.

anything about it.

He's not my boyfriend.

that I tutor

He's cute... for a boy.

and basketball and baseball.

-[sighs] We usually
meet at the library.

57:07.838 --> 57:10.357
But this time,
we met at his house.

57:10.496 --> 57:11.566
His parents were gone,

57:11.704 --> 57:13.878
and so,
we drank a couple beers.

wanted to get it over with,

only happens for me once,

but dick is not for me.

-Afterwards, Kirk just
kind of passed out,

57:32.966 --> 57:35.072
so I decided to walk home.

57:36.729 --> 57:39.628
And as soon as
I left his house,

57:39.766 --> 57:42.286
a man started following me.

57:42.424 --> 57:44.115
I couldn't really make out
the details of his face,

57:44.253 --> 57:45.772
but he may have been
wearing a mask,

57:45.910 --> 57:48.879
like a mask
that looks like a face.

57:49.017 --> 57:50.501
And I could see
at the end of the street,

57:50.639 --> 57:52.192
there was a cop car, so
I started walking toward it,

57:52.330 --> 57:54.781
like faster and faster,
even though fuck cops,

57:54.919 --> 57:57.439
but the man started walking
faster too.

57:57.577 --> 57:58.751
When I finally reached
the cop car,

57:58.889 --> 58:01.029
my whole body
just heaves forward.

58:01.167 --> 58:03.894
The cop looks up,
we lock eyes and then...

58:05.689 --> 58:07.276
it happened.

58:07.414 --> 58:09.106
-The man grabbed you
and knocked you out

58:09.244 --> 58:11.108
and shoved you
into the cop car?

58:12.765 --> 58:15.630
-I barfed.

58:15.768 --> 58:18.529
It was an explosion of barf.

58:18.667 --> 58:20.566

from last night.

58:20.704 --> 58:21.981
-Did he recognize you?

in the way he asked,

show last night

58:28.781 --> 58:32.163

that she was with Kirk.

with Darby and April P.

58:34.131 --> 58:36.754

Hey, did you hear
that they found Evelyn?

58:41.414 --> 58:42.898
He was with her too.

58:43.036 --> 58:45.625
She was really
hacked up, I guess.

58:45.763 --> 58:48.007
Even her eyes were gone.

and don't cry.

01:09:01.206 --> 01:09:02.483
Let me give you a ride home.

01:09:02.621 --> 01:09:03.828
-I can take her home.
-[Sterling] Nope.

01:09:03.966 --> 01:09:07.384
You need to go
pick up your stepmom.

01:09:07.522 --> 01:09:10.836
Clinic called.
Her eyes are swollen shut.

01:09:10.974 --> 01:09:12.700
Said she's gonna look
like a teenager

01:09:12.837 --> 01:09:14.529
but she can't drive.

01:09:14.667 --> 01:09:16.255
-Why can't you get her?

01:09:17.532 --> 01:09:20.156
-She's not talking to me
right now.

01:09:20.294 --> 01:09:22.743
Come on. I'll take you home.

01:09:26.300 --> 01:09:28.163
-I'll call you later
for a do-over?

01:09:44.214 --> 01:09:45.319
[Sterling] Sit up front.

01:09:46.803 --> 01:09:48.529
The back seat
smells like barf.

01:09:52.843 --> 01:09:54.189
[car door closes]

01:09:56.606 --> 01:09:58.297
-What happened to your face?

01:09:58.435 --> 01:10:02.612
-[scoffs]
You should see the other guy.

01:10:02.750 --> 01:10:04.027
-Hm.

01:10:04.165 --> 01:10:06.478
Isn't that what people say
when the other guy won?

01:10:06.616 --> 01:10:10.792
-Well, this was
some kind of other guy...

01:10:14.106 --> 01:10:15.659
and she didn't win.

01:10:15.797 --> 01:10:17.247
-She?

01:10:20.008 --> 01:10:21.389
-More like an it.

01:10:21.527 --> 01:10:25.290
[car engine starts, revs]

01:10:26.877 --> 01:10:30.260
[rain pattering]

01:10:41.340 --> 01:10:43.204
-What the fuck
just happened?

01:10:43.342 --> 01:10:44.723
-We gotta try again
tomorrow.

01:10:46.690 --> 01:10:48.485
-Well, you just let her go?

01:10:48.623 --> 01:10:50.970
I know that cop.
We should follow them.

01:10:51.108 --> 01:10:55.458
-She's fine. That's my dad.
He's gonna take her home.

01:11:03.328 --> 01:11:04.777
-Thanks for the ride.

01:11:04.915 --> 01:11:06.538
-I'll wait
till you get inside.

01:11:08.436 --> 01:11:09.679
Hey.

01:11:12.198 --> 01:11:13.648
You get a gold star.

01:11:19.792 --> 01:11:23.037
-[straining,
muffled groans]

01:11:47.337 --> 01:11:49.788
-You still owe me
from the last one.

01:11:49.926 --> 01:11:52.756
Marcy doesn't like her neck

01:11:52.894 --> 01:11:57.485
and she found a clinic that
will fix it as an outpatient.

01:11:57.623 --> 01:11:59.418
But they only take cash.

01:12:01.972 --> 01:12:03.111
[button clicks]

01:12:03.249 --> 01:12:05.355
[car revving]

01:12:07.875 --> 01:12:11.465
[device clicking, hissing]

01:12:49.572 --> 01:12:51.953
[wet squelch]

01:12:54.853 --> 01:12:58.581
[device whirring, sucking]

01:13:10.731 --> 01:13:11.801
[Perpetrator]
Deep breaths...

01:13:13.561 --> 01:13:16.012
and stay very still.

01:13:16.150 --> 01:13:22.363
This is very bad, but it--
it can always get worse.

01:13:22.501 --> 01:13:28.231
The first time
is excruciating,

01:13:28.369 --> 01:13:33.029
but I advise you not to cry.

01:13:33.167 --> 01:13:37.343
There is nothing less
desirable in this ugly world

01:13:37.482 --> 01:13:40.208
than a young girl in tears.

01:13:45.490 --> 01:13:48.976
[distressing music playing]

01:14:08.961 --> 01:14:10.894
[groans]

01:14:11.032 --> 01:14:12.137
-What?

01:14:15.243 --> 01:14:17.211
What the fuck is this?

01:14:18.902 --> 01:14:20.628
What the fuck
are you gonna do to me?

01:14:20.766 --> 01:14:22.527
-No more talking!

01:14:22.665 --> 01:14:24.839
-I don't have any money.
I'm just some girl.

01:14:24.977 --> 01:14:26.738
-[escalating anger]
Shut the fuck up!

01:14:26.876 --> 01:14:28.671
Ugh!

01:14:28.809 --> 01:14:31.467
[breathes deeply]

01:14:33.365 --> 01:14:35.643
-Fuck you!

01:14:35.781 --> 01:14:38.266
-[contained fury]
You act like you like it.

01:14:38.404 --> 01:14:40.545
You act like you like me.

01:14:43.962 --> 01:14:47.931
Now, try to relax...

01:14:48.069 --> 01:14:50.934
[both] I am about to take
advantage of you.

01:14:51.072 --> 01:14:54.041
-[mocking cackle]
-[Perpetrator groaning]

01:15:00.806 --> 01:15:02.290
[punch thrown]

01:15:33.356 --> 01:15:34.737
[distant water dripping]

01:15:34.875 --> 01:15:36.186
-[groaning]

01:15:58.588 --> 01:16:00.935
[screaming]

01:16:01.073 --> 01:16:02.592
[Aviva] Get in here.
Get in here.

01:16:02.730 --> 01:16:03.731
Get in here.

01:16:03.869 --> 01:16:04.905
[Jonny screaming]

01:16:05.043 --> 01:16:07.597
-[shushing]
Be quiet. Please.

01:16:07.735 --> 01:16:10.013
[forceful whisper]
You're safer under here.

01:16:10.151 --> 01:16:12.291
He's watching and listening.

01:16:19.851 --> 01:16:20.955
-Aviva.

01:16:23.751 --> 01:16:24.925
And Darby.

01:16:26.443 --> 01:16:28.031
April P.

01:16:30.206 --> 01:16:31.517
You're all here.

01:16:31.656 --> 01:16:33.071
[Aviva] Except Evelyn.

01:16:33.209 --> 01:16:34.486
They took her out
a few days ago.

01:16:34.624 --> 01:16:37.247
She hasn't come back.

01:16:37.385 --> 01:16:39.974
-Evelyn is dead.

01:16:40.112 --> 01:16:43.737
I heard she was
scalped and skinned.

01:16:43.875 --> 01:16:46.878
-He took everything
he could from her.

01:16:47.016 --> 01:16:49.639
He's gonna do that to us too.

01:16:49.777 --> 01:16:51.572
This is a chop shop.

01:16:51.710 --> 01:16:54.368
We're being stripped
for parts.

01:17:02.963 --> 01:17:04.999
-[yells loudly]

01:17:06.069 --> 01:17:08.451
[growls]

01:17:08.589 --> 01:17:10.315
-[holding breath]

01:17:10.453 --> 01:17:12.351
-When he calls you
out of here, you just go.

01:17:12.489 --> 01:17:14.802
-[screaming]

01:17:14.940 --> 01:17:16.252
[Aviva] When you're
out there with him,

01:17:16.390 --> 01:17:20.463
no matter what,
don't fucking cry.

01:17:20.601 --> 01:17:23.604
-What happens if you cry?

01:17:23.742 --> 01:17:25.261
-He'll take your tongue.

01:17:25.399 --> 01:17:29.230
-[cries]

01:17:29.368 --> 01:17:31.716
-[low growling murmur]
I'd fear me...

01:17:31.854 --> 01:17:34.822
I'd fuck me...

01:17:34.960 --> 01:17:37.825
-How long has this
been going on for?

01:17:37.963 --> 01:17:39.793
-Too long.

01:17:39.931 --> 01:17:41.657
April P. and Darby
need a doctor.

01:17:41.795 --> 01:17:44.211
I think their wounds
are infected.

01:17:44.349 --> 01:17:49.250
-My fucking god.
You two look terrible.

01:17:51.701 --> 01:17:55.567
[groans] We have to
get out of here.

01:17:55.705 --> 01:17:58.777
-How? There's only
one way in and one way out.

01:17:58.915 --> 01:18:01.573
We're already
as good as gone forever.

01:18:01.711 --> 01:18:03.575
I miss my mom.

01:18:03.713 --> 01:18:07.165
-[cries] I'd fuck me...

01:18:11.272 --> 01:18:13.689
-Do you have one of these?

01:18:13.827 --> 01:18:17.382
-I have two, both at the
base of my spine.

01:18:17.520 --> 01:18:20.316
-What happens if--
if you pull it out?

01:18:20.454 --> 01:18:22.836
-Evelyn pulled hers out.

01:18:22.974 --> 01:18:25.390
It was like
a fountain of blood.

01:18:25.528 --> 01:18:27.047
I'm not sure if she knew
that would happen

01:18:27.185 --> 01:18:29.843
or if she was trying to die.

01:18:29.981 --> 01:18:33.191
-We are all
going to survive this.

01:18:33.329 --> 01:18:36.677
But you have to help me
get this thing out.

01:18:36.815 --> 01:18:39.024
-How the fuck
is that going to help?

01:18:39.162 --> 01:18:40.716
-Fountain of blood.

01:18:43.753 --> 01:18:47.170
On three, yank this out.

01:18:47.308 --> 01:18:50.795
Stay under here until I say,

01:18:50.933 --> 01:18:57.733
"Code Massacre,
Level Bloodbath."

01:18:57.871 --> 01:18:59.251
Right?

01:18:59.389 --> 01:19:03.393
One, two, three.

01:19:03.531 --> 01:19:07.087
[screams in pain]

01:19:11.781 --> 01:19:13.679
-[growling]

01:19:13.818 --> 01:19:16.855
[suspenseful music playing]

01:19:20.617 --> 01:19:22.033
No!

01:19:22.171 --> 01:19:25.208
[suspenseful music continues]

01:19:32.664 --> 01:19:33.976
[door opens]

-[shuddering breaths]

[suspenseful music continues]

01:19:51.027 --> 01:19:52.995
[blood boiling]

-[strains]

-[gasps deeply]
Code Massacre...

01:21:25.501 --> 01:21:28.228
Level Bloodbath!

01:21:31.265 --> 01:21:32.542
Come on.
-[Aviva] Which way?

01:21:32.680 --> 01:21:33.854
[Jonny] I don't know.
I don't know.

01:21:33.992 --> 01:21:36.305
Just fucking go. Go!

01:21:36.443 --> 01:21:39.929
[intense, suspenseful music
playing]

01:22:21.212 --> 01:22:23.973
Oh, my god.
That's my dad.

01:22:24.111 --> 01:22:25.457
That's my dad's van.

01:22:28.944 --> 01:22:31.567
-Get in the van.
Get in the van.

01:22:31.705 --> 01:22:35.778
-That's my dad's van.
Who the fuck are you?!

01:22:35.916 --> 01:22:37.538
-Girls, come on.
Get in!

01:22:37.676 --> 01:22:40.058
-[Jonny] Oh, my god.
-Come on. Come on. Come on.

01:22:40.196 --> 01:22:41.957
Get in the van. Get in!

01:22:43.234 --> 01:22:44.960
Is this all of you?
-[Jonny] Yes.

01:22:45.098 --> 01:22:46.651
-Okay.

01:22:46.789 --> 01:22:48.549
[van door closes]

01:22:48.687 --> 01:22:51.449
-[girls panting]

01:22:51.587 --> 01:22:54.659
-Oh, girls. What must you
have been through?

01:22:54.797 --> 01:22:57.006
Oh. Oh, you smell so bad.

01:22:57.144 --> 01:22:58.283
-How did you find us?

01:22:58.421 --> 01:23:00.044
-I didn't. She did.

01:23:01.528 --> 01:23:04.980
-I have a very keen
sense of smell.

01:23:05.118 --> 01:23:06.705
-Who is she?

01:23:06.843 --> 01:23:08.155
-Your mother.

01:23:11.572 --> 01:23:13.298
-I owe you an explanation.

01:23:17.337 --> 01:23:18.407
What happened back there?

01:23:18.545 --> 01:23:21.272
-Code Massacre...
Level Bloodbath.

01:23:21.410 --> 01:23:23.343
-I pulled this
out of his chest.

01:23:24.516 --> 01:23:26.760
I was aiming for his heart.

01:24:03.245 --> 01:24:06.144
[heart pounding]

01:24:14.670 --> 01:24:18.122
[footsteps]

01:24:19.088 --> 01:24:20.434
-This used to be my room.

01:24:22.229 --> 01:24:25.405
-There is a big bloodstain
on the mattress.

01:24:25.543 --> 01:24:26.647
-Mm-hm.

01:24:28.684 --> 01:24:31.342
Your birth was complicated.

01:24:31.480 --> 01:24:35.277
[chuckles] I had a C-section.

01:24:35.415 --> 01:24:38.487
My incision came open
on day five.

01:24:38.625 --> 01:24:40.040
I came in here
to change my underwear

01:24:40.178 --> 01:24:46.874
and stood up and came apart
like a bean burrito.

01:24:47.012 --> 01:24:48.842
I bled all over everything.

01:24:50.913 --> 01:24:53.398
-Why are you
wearing my clothes?

01:24:56.470 --> 01:24:58.265
-My other clothes don't fit.

01:25:00.509 --> 01:25:02.752
I haven't been myself
for a long while.

01:25:04.133 --> 01:25:05.652
-What do I call you?

01:25:06.756 --> 01:25:14.074
-Jean. Same as before,
but with a J.

01:25:14.212 --> 01:25:16.145
Or you can call me Mom.

01:25:17.250 --> 01:25:19.148
-We don't know
each other like that.

01:25:24.602 --> 01:25:26.742
-You were hit by a car
when you were five.

01:25:28.433 --> 01:25:31.574
You were... you were going
after an ice cream truck

01:25:31.712 --> 01:25:33.576
for a push-up.

01:25:33.714 --> 01:25:35.130
You were in a body cast
for months

01:25:35.268 --> 01:25:36.407
and you missed
the part of first grade

01:25:36.545 --> 01:25:38.236
where you learn to
tell the time.

01:25:38.374 --> 01:25:40.825
Seventh grade,
you asked all the teachers

01:25:40.963 --> 01:25:44.380
to call you Jennifer.

01:25:44.518 --> 01:25:46.796
And you had two best friends
named Lana.

01:25:49.109 --> 01:25:51.146
Onions irritate your stomach,

01:25:51.284 --> 01:25:53.700
and peaches
make your tongue feel fat.

01:25:54.804 --> 01:25:55.909
You like the smell
of gasoline

01:25:56.047 --> 01:25:58.153
and the way I sing,

01:25:58.291 --> 01:26:00.155
but you never let me sing.

01:26:01.190 --> 01:26:05.470
I've been right with you
your whole life.

01:26:05.608 --> 01:26:07.541
I just looked
like someone else.

01:26:11.166 --> 01:26:15.963
-How? Why?

01:26:16.101 --> 01:26:17.482
Who were you?

01:26:18.966 --> 01:26:20.313
-Combination
of a few guys I knew

01:26:20.451 --> 01:26:22.177
around the time
you were born.

01:26:23.833 --> 01:26:28.113
When I turned 18,
I practiced constantly.

01:26:28.252 --> 01:26:30.046
Not just tuning in
other people

01:26:30.185 --> 01:26:33.326
but actually becoming them...

01:26:33.464 --> 01:26:36.605
passing entirely
as someone else.

01:26:36.743 --> 01:26:41.817
-You were hiding from me
for all of these years.

01:26:41.955 --> 01:26:43.232
-I'm sorry.

01:26:44.647 --> 01:26:47.443
I just meant to hide
from your father.

01:26:47.581 --> 01:26:49.445
Our relationship was...

01:26:50.757 --> 01:26:53.656
was a cruel experiment
to him.

01:26:56.003 --> 01:26:59.110
I didn't think he could
dislike someone more than me

01:26:59.248 --> 01:27:01.975
until you were born.

01:27:02.113 --> 01:27:04.288
So then we vanished.

01:27:04.426 --> 01:27:07.049
But I knew
he'd come after us.

01:27:07.187 --> 01:27:08.637
So I did what I could.

01:27:10.052 --> 01:27:14.850
He was looking for
a single Black mom,

01:27:14.988 --> 01:27:16.955
not a single white dad.

01:27:19.026 --> 01:27:22.237
I didn't expect
to like it so much.

01:27:22.375 --> 01:27:27.380
No lingering looks,
no come-ons, no...

01:27:27.518 --> 01:27:33.386
no unwanted touching.
No unwanted anything.

01:27:33.524 --> 01:27:36.423
But then I saw you
becoming a teenager.

01:27:36.561 --> 01:27:39.461
And I watched it all
happening to you.

01:27:39.599 --> 01:27:42.809
And I didn't just watch,
I-I-I could feel everything.

01:27:44.189 --> 01:27:45.570
Over the past few years,

01:27:45.708 --> 01:27:47.227
the only time I haven't
been in terrible pain

01:27:47.365 --> 01:27:49.264
is when I've been
knocked out.

01:27:51.818 --> 01:27:54.890
And I was afraid
you'd go looking for me.

01:27:56.443 --> 01:27:59.204
I was wrong to hide.

01:27:59.343 --> 01:28:01.068
And I certainly
haven't healed.

01:28:05.521 --> 01:28:07.730
I wish I could say
I did the best I could.

01:28:12.770 --> 01:28:14.737
-It wasn't that awful.

01:28:14.875 --> 01:28:18.223
You weren't that much worse
than the other dads I know.

01:28:18.362 --> 01:28:20.018
-And how's Hildie been?

01:28:20.156 --> 01:28:21.813
-A fiend's fiend.

01:28:24.920 --> 01:28:29.856
-You're gonna be okay.
You're all going to be okay.

01:28:29.994 --> 01:28:33.238
Growing bodies
are highly regenerative,

01:28:33.377 --> 01:28:35.689
especially yours.

01:28:35.827 --> 01:28:37.795
The only thing adults really
appreciate about young people

01:28:37.933 --> 01:28:40.763
is their ability
to bounce back.

01:28:42.593 --> 01:28:47.839
-We still don't know
who he is, where he lives.

01:28:47.977 --> 01:28:50.290
Once we got out,
we just started running

01:28:50.428 --> 01:28:54.467
and didn't look back.

01:28:54.605 --> 01:28:57.780
Thanks for coming to get me.

01:28:59.575 --> 01:29:02.682
-It's not easy for me
to be back here.

01:29:02.820 --> 01:29:07.031
I have a feeling
your dad is here somewhere.

01:29:08.584 --> 01:29:10.931
He's a monster.

01:29:11.069 --> 01:29:12.416
-So am I.

01:29:14.935 --> 01:29:19.457

You're so fucking special.

01:29:21.425 --> 01:29:22.771

As you know,
we are here this afternoon

01:30:04.019 --> 01:30:07.712
to honor
these brave young women,

01:30:07.850 --> 01:30:12.545
who recently survived
an unspeakable ordeal.

01:30:12.683 --> 01:30:16.514
They were tortured
and brutalized,

01:30:16.652 --> 01:30:18.965
and narrowly escaped.

01:30:19.103 --> 01:30:21.864
We can only hope
that with time,

01:30:22.002 --> 01:30:24.591
they will be able to
put this all behind them,

01:30:24.729 --> 01:30:27.007

never happened,

01:30:27.145 --> 01:30:32.047
and go on to live
long and decent lives.

01:30:32.185 --> 01:30:36.465
My stepson,
who most of you know,

01:30:36.603 --> 01:30:38.674
has asked if
he can read a letter

01:30:38.812 --> 01:30:40.504
