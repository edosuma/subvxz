08:12.000 --> 08:13.000
I think so. Maybe like this?

08:13.000 --> 08:15.000
Maybe over here. Prohyas, that's upside down.

08:15.000 --> 08:17.000
You're upside down! Shh!

08:17.000 --> 08:19.000
Did we catch the thief ye--

08:20.000 --> 08:23.000
What am I looking at? What am I looking at?!

08:23.000 --> 08:24.000
Hey, buddy.

08:24.000 --> 08:27.000
Uh, funny story about this whole vegetable Magisword thing.

08:27.000 --> 08:30.000
Oof. Listen, Hoppus, it's not what it looks like.

08:30.000 --> 08:32.000
It looks like you two are the ones

08:32.000 --> 08:34.000
that stole my Magiswords in the first place!

08:34.000 --> 08:36.000
Eh, we found them under Prohyas' bed.

08:36.000 --> 08:38.000
But it wasn't his fault, you see.

08:38.000 --> 08:40.000
Yeah, my stomach took over my body when I was asleep

08:40.000 --> 08:43.000
and stole your Magiswords to feed me vegetables.

08:43.000 --> 08:44.000
Liar! You hate vegetables!

08:44.000 --> 08:45.000
You wouldn't even eat

08:45.000 --> 08:47.000
your mother's incredible broccoli soup!

08:47.000 --> 08:48.000
Ha ha, exactly!

08:49.000 --> 08:51.000
I didn't want vegetables, but my sentient stomach did.

08:51.000 --> 08:53.000
What part of this is unclear? [ Snarls ]

08:53.000 --> 08:55.000
You expect me to believe horse nonsense like that?

08:55.000 --> 08:58.000
You two are just a couple of greedy little rats

08:58.000 --> 09:01.000
that want any Magiswords you can get your hands on!

09:01.000 --> 09:04.000
And just when I was beginning to trust someone.

09:04.000 --> 09:05.000
[ Both crying ] No!

09:06.000 --> 09:08.000
Hoppus, we're on the level, I assure you.

09:08.000 --> 09:09.000
Come on, tummy, say something.

09:09.000 --> 09:13.000
Prohyas' stomach: How am I supposed to do that

09:13.000 --> 09:15.000
in this position?!

09:15.000 --> 09:18.000
Time for "Operation Make Him Think He Dreamt This."

09:18.000 --> 09:19.000
Huh? [ Snoring ]

09:19.000 --> 09:24.000
When you wake up, it'll all have been a dream.

09:25.000 --> 09:28.000
He-Hey, buddy. Uh, you're dreaming right now.

09:28.000 --> 09:33.000
I've never been so angry in all my miserable life!

09:33.000 --> 09:36.000
Announcer: Electric Razor Magisword!

09:36.000 --> 09:38.000
Chainsaw Magisword!

09:38.000 --> 09:41.000
Prohyas: Ah, my razor is starting to jam.

09:41.000 --> 09:44.000
We better stop him before he does anything more intense.

09:44.000 --> 09:47.000
Announcer: Super Hoppus Rage Combo:

09:44.000 --> 09:47.000
Hailstorm Caesar Salad!

09:50.000 --> 09:52.000
I mean, it's just a veggie cloud.

09:52.000 --> 09:55.000
[ Gasps ] Aah! We got to knock him out before we're stir-fried.

09:55.000 --> 09:58.000
But Sleeping Dragon was too weak!

09:58.000 --> 10:00.000
Well, let's try and give it a boost.

10:00.000 --> 10:02.000
Announcer: Sleeping Dragon Magisword!

10:02.000 --> 10:03.000
Blow Dryer Magisword!

10:03.000 --> 10:07.000
Together: Super Teamwork Combo: Lullabyebye.

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
[ Snoring ]

10:12.000 --> 10:13.000
Prohyas: Boop! [ Giggles ]

10:13.000 --> 10:15.000
I always wanted to do that. Do it again.

10:15.000 --> 10:18.000
Boop! Boop! [ Giggling ]

10:18.000 --> 10:19.000
Boop! [ Giggles ]

10:19.000 --> 10:20.000
Boop! [ Giggles ]

10:21.000 --> 10:22.000
Aww, so what happened in the end?

10:22.000 --> 10:24.000
What a good mission that was.

10:24.000 --> 10:26.000
Did he forgive you? Or did you apologize?

10:26.000 --> 10:27.000
Such a fun adventure.

10:27.000 --> 10:30.000
Did you do anything at all to apologize?

10:30.000 --> 10:32.000
So many great moments between friends.

10:32.000 --> 10:34.000
Prohyas. Your childish gluttony is literally the reason

10:35.000 --> 10:37.000
Hoppus will never trust another Warrior ever again!

10:37.000 --> 10:39.000
I am 10,000% mature.

10:39.000 --> 10:41.000
Announcer: Wicker Snapper Magisword!

10:41.000 --> 10:42.000
Vambre?

10:42.000 --> 10:44.000
Then surely, a big mature boy

10:44.000 --> 10:47.000
can enjoy a bowl of Mom's broccoli soup.

10:47.000 --> 10:49.000
Vambre, let's not be rash now.

10:49.000 --> 10:51.000
Vegetables are one thing, but broccoli --

10:51.000 --> 10:53.000
Prohyas' stomach: My name is Prohyas,

10:54.000 --> 10:56.000
and I want you to feed me broccoli!

10:56.000 --> 10:58.000
Whatever you say, dear brother.

10:58.000 --> 10:59.000
No!

10:59.000 --> 11:02.000
Hello? Oh, Hoppus, what can I do you for?

11:02.000 --> 11:05.000
Can I bother you for another bowl of soup, ma'am?

11:02.000 --> 11:05.000
Yes!
