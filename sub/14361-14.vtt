(Crows cawing)

00:05.274 --> 00:06.909
Have you guys seen my iPad?

00:07.315 --> 00:08.557
<i>(Frankie)</i>
<i>I know what you're thinking.</i>

00:08.672 --> 00:11.023
<i>80% of our appliances</i>
<i>have duct tape on 'em.</i>

00:11.128 --> 00:13.088
<i>How the hell did Brick</i>
<i>get an iPad?</i>

00:13.390 --> 00:15.112
<i>Well, when a kid</i>
<i>really wants something,</i>

00:15.216 --> 00:18.140
<i>they chip away at you like</i>
<i>a lumberjack on a redwood.</i>

00:18.276 --> 00:20.470
<i>I guess it started</i>
<i>about a month ago.</i>

00:20.812 --> 00:23.061
(Laughs)

00:23.733 --> 00:26.194
- What's so funny?
- Hey, Mike, get in here.

00:26.292 --> 00:28.485
Go ahead. Ask your dad
what you just asked me.

00:28.770 --> 00:30.449
Can you guys buy me an iPad?

00:30.587 --> 00:32.402
(Laughs)

00:33.288 --> 00:35.169
- Thanks, buddy. I needed that.
- Yeah.

00:35.724 --> 00:37.352
- See you guys tonight.
- Okay.

00:37.857 --> 00:39.843
(Laughs) "Can you guys
buy me an iPad?"

00:40.078 --> 00:42.696
- Yeah. (Laughs)
- So the iPad? Yes or no?

00:42.806 --> 00:44.935
(Door opens and closes) Brick, the
only way you're getting an iPad

00:45.057 --> 00:47.105
is if you're in
Steve Jobs' will.

00:47.325 --> 00:49.337
(Whistling)

00:50.462 --> 00:51.895
(Bottles rattle)

00:53.187 --> 00:54.169
What?
(Refrigerator door closes)

00:54.280 --> 00:55.785
Today is baby day
for spirit week,

00:55.892 --> 00:57.648
so me, Sean, and Darrin
are rockin' the diapers.

00:57.757 --> 00:59.223
Baby seniors rule!
(Rattles)

00:59.960 --> 01:01.874
Hey, uh, if you get
a chance today,

01:02.018 --> 01:03.569
you wanna stop by
the College Center

01:03.687 --> 01:05.972
and find out why we haven't
heard from East Indiana yet?

01:06.082 --> 01:08.361
Mom, a lot of people haven't
heard anything yet, all right?

01:08.476 --> 01:09.710
You don't have to worry
about this.

01:09.837 --> 01:11.117
I got it under control.

01:11.246 --> 01:13.528
I'm practically an adult, so...

01:19.315 --> 01:21.839
Ah! Good thing you're wearing
those diapers, dude,

01:21.956 --> 01:25.059
'cause guess who just got
accepted to Notre Dame.

01:25.157 --> 01:26.737
Wow. Maybe you'll date
a leprechaun.

01:26.860 --> 01:27.909
It's not just him.

01:28.043 --> 01:30.426
You are looking at two pillars
of higher education.

01:30.610 --> 01:31.821
I just got my fat envelope

01:31.949 --> 01:34.391
from Midwest Institute
of Air Conditioning Repair.

01:34.595 --> 01:35.844
First choice!

01:36.259 --> 01:37.624
All right, so what's the story
with you, man?

01:37.728 --> 01:39.316
You get the good news
from East Indy yet?

01:39.437 --> 01:40.726
Uh, nah. Nothing official,

01:40.837 --> 01:43.080
but the recruiter pretty much
told me it's a lock,

01:43.218 --> 01:46.805
so... (Chuckles)
I am not sweating it.

01:46.913 --> 01:48.232
Yeah. No worries.

01:48.357 --> 01:49.587
If it doesn't happen,
I could probably get you in

01:49.702 --> 01:51.268
at MIACR.

01:51.587 --> 01:52.993
I'm a legacy.

01:53.567 --> 01:55.213
All right, men, uh,
enough college talk.

01:55.334 --> 01:57.298
Let's talk about something
really important.

01:57.493 --> 02:00.016
- Our senior prank.
- Yeah.

02:00.142 --> 02:01.887
I'm not sure I'm really
feeling a prank this year.

02:02.013 --> 02:04.499
We're seniors.
When else are we gonna do it?

02:04.615 --> 02:05.843
I just don't feel like it,
'kay?

02:05.955 --> 02:08.565
- Don't get your diapers in a twist.
- They're not diapers.

02:08.661 --> 02:10.061
They're adult comfort shorts.

02:10.217 --> 02:12.361
My grandpa wears 'em
when he plays golf.

02:12.785 --> 02:13.954
(School bell rings)

02:15.161 --> 02:17.546
<i>You know how Sue was usually</i>
<i>invisible to teachers?</i>

02:17.687 --> 02:19.913
<i>Well, this year,</i>
<i>she finally got noticed by one.</i>

02:20.021 --> 02:21.855
The bell has rung, people.

02:22.222 --> 02:24.933
The school may find it amusing
to have you all dressed up

02:25.045 --> 02:26.235
and run around
like little babies,

02:26.357 --> 02:29.537
but in my class, you will be
treated like the young adults

02:29.661 --> 02:32.434
you claim to be.
Miss Heck...

02:33.217 --> 02:35.115
next time you write
an essay for my class,

02:35.241 --> 02:38.421
let's try using one color ink
instead of 20.

02:39.016 --> 02:39.801
(Pens clatter)

02:39.930 --> 02:40.994
Oh, and I hate to rain
on your parade,

02:41.109 --> 02:42.559
but perhaps it's time
to stop dotting your I's

02:42.708 --> 02:44.672
with little hearts.
(Paper rustles)

02:44.803 --> 02:46.919
(Students chuckle and murmur)

02:48.736 --> 02:50.276
Silence!

02:50.436 --> 02:51.921
(Students gasp)
Do any of you have the desire

02:52.043 --> 02:53.471
to think outside yourselves

02:53.587 --> 02:55.693
and to contribute to the world
you live in?

02:56.175 --> 02:58.288
Somebody say, "yes, I do."

02:58.415 --> 02:59.532
Yes, I do.

02:59.651 --> 03:02.094
No, you don't.
You're all pleasure seekers.

03:02.188 --> 03:05.214
It's me, me, me 24/7.

03:05.326 --> 03:07.539
You get upset if the battery
in your phone dies.

03:07.673 --> 03:10.981
But did you know that
Alessandro Volta

03:11.116 --> 03:12.992
invented the battery in 1800?

03:13.110 --> 03:14.105
Well, of course you don't.

03:14.211 --> 03:16.099
You think it was invented
by a little pink bunny

03:16.276 --> 03:20.092
who goes around banging away
on a big bass drum.

03:20.816 --> 03:24.895
Now for your next assignment,
you will propose an hypothesis.

03:25.024 --> 03:27.475
You will design and produce
an experiment

03:27.600 --> 03:29.421
to test said hypothesis
and determine

03:29.543 --> 03:31.209
whether to accept or reject it...
(Pen clicks)

03:31.316 --> 03:35.795
and I want this question
to come from your soul.

03:35.918 --> 03:37.927
Where is your passion?

03:38.077 --> 03:39.759
What do you care about?

03:39.928 --> 03:41.934
What are you
really interested in?

03:42.892 --> 03:44.341
The answer is not gonna be
on your computer

03:44.462 --> 03:45.297
or your television.

03:45.418 --> 03:47.924
He's not gonna pop up for you
in an app.

03:48.284 --> 03:51.288
This project is 40%
of your grade.

03:51.562 --> 03:56.305
So as you Americans say,
you had better get crackin'.

_

04:11.496 --> 04:13.367
(Hair dryer whirring)

04:13.496 --> 04:15.468
Dad, can you please
get me an iPad?

04:16.438 --> 04:18.738
I'm heating up my coffee
with a hair dryer.

04:18.870 --> 04:20.961
What do you think?
(Hair dryer turns off)

04:21.454 --> 04:22.194
(Electricity crackles)

04:22.301 --> 04:24.627
I don't think you realize what
getting me an iPad would mean.

04:24.753 --> 04:26.028
For example,
when we go on trips,

04:26.144 --> 04:27.755
you wouldn't have to
lug around all my books.

04:27.890 --> 04:29.096
Remember that time
you threw out your back

04:29.218 --> 04:30.698
while picking up my book bag?

04:31.018 --> 04:32.017
(Door opens)
The answer's still no,

04:32.111 --> 04:33.999
but thanks for reminding me I'm old.
(Door closes)

04:34.371 --> 04:35.211
(Sighs)

04:35.328 --> 04:36.851
Well?
Anything in the mail?

04:36.987 --> 04:38.016
Just bills.

04:38.135 --> 04:39.430
You know,
it wouldn't just be for me.

04:39.536 --> 04:41.056
The whole family could use it.
(Sighs)

04:41.197 --> 04:43.053
Are we still talking
about that iPad?

04:43.162 --> 04:44.886
You know, it was funny
the first 70 times.

04:45.007 --> 04:46.827
Now it's starting to get old.

04:47.624 --> 04:49.172
We should have heard by now.

04:49.290 --> 04:51.195
The guy made it sound
like it was locked up.

04:51.583 --> 04:53.831
I gotta tell you, Frankie, I'm
getting a little nervous here.

04:53.938 --> 04:55.302
You know what?
There's a little hope.

04:55.416 --> 04:57.162
(Refrigerator closes) One of the
girls in my dental materials class

04:57.283 --> 04:58.815
said that her sister
applied to East Indy

04:58.955 --> 05:00.239
about the same time as Axl,

05:00.361 --> 05:01.975
and she still
hasn't heard yet either.

05:02.202 --> 05:05.182
- Hmm. - If I get lost on my way
to school and need directions...

05:05.293 --> 05:06.226
(Sighs)
there's an app for that.

05:06.339 --> 05:08.041
Why are we still talking
about this? Go away.

05:08.163 --> 05:09.505
But, dad, you're not letting me
prove my--

05:09.606 --> 05:11.352
Go.
(Hair dryer resumes whirring)

05:11.948 --> 05:13.187
(Hair dryer turns off)

05:14.307 --> 05:15.327
(Sighs)

05:16.645 --> 05:17.691
Brad.

05:18.303 --> 05:20.156
How would you like to be
the first subject

05:20.289 --> 05:21.593
in my science experiment?

05:21.730 --> 05:23.225
Are you kidding?
I'd be honored.

05:23.401 --> 05:25.877
But I should warn you, I can't
tolerate needles or tickling.

05:26.007 --> 05:27.557
We should be good. Okay.

05:27.702 --> 05:30.330
I'll smile at you, and then
if you smile back at me,

05:30.489 --> 05:35.046
that proves my hypothesis
that smiling is contagious.

05:35.234 --> 05:36.570
Love it.

05:36.716 --> 05:39.105
You will be subject X.

05:39.297 --> 05:41.406
The first entry in my log.

05:41.524 --> 05:42.252
Ready?

05:42.335 --> 05:43.396
Ready.

05:46.004 --> 05:47.069
Brad?

05:47.184 --> 05:48.118
Yeah?

05:48.229 --> 05:49.655
I think you
have to stop smiling.

05:49.769 --> 05:51.338
Otherwise, when I smile at you,

05:51.493 --> 05:54.489
- we won't know if you smile back.
- Oh, right. Of course.

05:54.700 --> 05:57.031
Okay, I'm ready. Go.

05:58.578 --> 06:00.771
Oh! Damn it, Bradley.
Why can't you do this?

06:00.890 --> 06:02.647
You went to drama camp,
for God sake.

06:02.773 --> 06:05.137
It's not your fault, Brad.
The reason this isn't working

06:05.246 --> 06:07.242
is because I told you
the experiment.

06:07.414 --> 06:09.348
I was just so excited,
I had to share.

06:09.493 --> 06:12.193
But I tainted the results.
You know what?

06:12.342 --> 06:14.907
I need to test my hypothesis
on strangers.

06:15.198 --> 06:16.270
Good luck.

06:18.125 --> 06:19.868
(Indistinct conversations)

06:23.609 --> 06:26.226
<i>So while Sue was trying to</i>
<i>prove smiling is contagious,</i>

06:26.362 --> 06:29.235
<i>Mike and I were proving</i>
<i>being nervous definitely was.</i>

06:29.384 --> 06:31.856
- Anything yet?
- Still waiting. I don't get it.

06:31.973 --> 06:33.725
We should have heard
something by now.

06:33.854 --> 06:35.067
You know that lady in my class?

06:35.196 --> 06:37.443
Her sister got accepted
to East Indiana today.

06:37.590 --> 06:41.588
Crap. Well, let's just agree,
whatever happens,

06:41.895 --> 06:44.140
he is not living
in our house next year.

06:44.491 --> 06:45.547
I think I should call the coach

06:45.689 --> 06:46.720
and see what's going on.

06:46.841 --> 06:49.668
No, we can't do that, Mike.
We don't wanna be those parents.

06:50.897 --> 06:52.213
(Gasps)

06:53.605 --> 06:54.341
(Engine turns off)

06:54.451 --> 06:56.009
Afternoon, folks.
(Chuckles)

06:56.120 --> 06:57.184
(Laughs)

06:57.288 --> 07:00.138
Oh, come on.
Mama needs a fat envelope.

07:00.261 --> 07:01.752
Beautiful day today, huh?

07:01.875 --> 07:04.037
Yeah, whatever. You got
anything else in there for us?

07:04.159 --> 07:05.932
- Nope. That's it.
- Uh, you know what?

07:06.055 --> 07:07.500
How about I just take
a little look myself?

07:07.607 --> 07:09.611
Oh, ma'am,
that's a federal offense.

07:09.727 --> 07:11.001
Hey, look, there's a mean dog.

07:11.113 --> 07:14.143
Ma'am, I have got to get
back on my route.

07:14.245 --> 07:16.097
There are other citizens
who are counting on me.

07:16.207 --> 07:19.377
(Starts engine) Oh, what are you, Batman?
Let me see in the damn bag!

07:19.745 --> 07:21.984
(Man shouts indistinctly)
(Tires squeak)

07:22.086 --> 07:25.100
This is my son's future
we're talking about!

07:25.250 --> 07:28.024
I know it's in there!
I know you have it!

07:28.141 --> 07:31.133
We never got
the Andersons' Christmas card!

07:37.668 --> 07:40.204
<i>Two weeks later, and still</i>
<i>nothing new with the mail.</i>

07:40.316 --> 07:41.881
<i>Well, not exactly nothing.</i>

07:42.000 --> 07:44.163
I can't believe
they switched our mailman.

07:44.278 --> 07:45.509
What are they worried
about me for?

07:45.622 --> 07:47.524
They're the ones
that go postal.

07:50.027 --> 07:51.619
Not now, Sue.

07:54.114 --> 07:55.604
You can dust all you want,
Brick.

07:55.711 --> 07:57.418
You're not getting an iPad.

08:00.259 --> 08:03.068
<i>So while Mike and I had been</i>
<i>harassing the loyal servants</i>

08:03.181 --> 08:04.596
<i>of the US Postal Service,</i>

08:04.774 --> 08:06.669
<i>turns out</i>
<i>it wasn't the '80s anymore,</i>

08:06.794 --> 08:08.223
<i>and the news</i>
<i>we were all waiting for</i>

08:08.346 --> 08:10.648
<i>was coming over</i>
<i>a different kind of mail.</i>

08:10.805 --> 08:12.198
(Cell phone buzzing)

08:14.345 --> 08:18.069
Yes! I'm in! Oh, my God!

08:18.185 --> 08:20.327
I just got an official e-mail
from East Indiana State.

08:20.447 --> 08:22.319
It's official! I'm in!
Oh, my God.

08:22.438 --> 08:25.856
That's it! I'm outta here!
So long, suckers!

08:25.956 --> 08:28.105
East Indiana State freshmen
rule!

08:28.208 --> 08:29.244
(High-pitched voice)
Ha ha ha ha!

08:29.337 --> 08:30.658
Whoo!

08:34.576 --> 08:36.589
I still have to graduate,
don't I?

08:44.941 --> 08:45.841
No.

08:45.978 --> 08:47.684
But this kid in my class,
Brian Becker, got one,

08:47.789 --> 08:49.495
and now everybody
flocks around him.

08:49.641 --> 08:50.948
And he's got a restless leg,

08:51.077 --> 08:53.146
and he suffers
from early onset alopecia.

08:53.277 --> 08:56.524
I'm just saying, you guys are
always on me to make friends.

08:56.628 --> 08:58.030
Yeah, it's a great way
to make friends,

08:58.156 --> 08:59.561
but you're not getting an iPad.

08:59.672 --> 09:01.101
So I was talking to mom
about the iPad,

09:01.230 --> 09:03.825
and she thinks it'd be a great
way for me to make friends.

09:03.938 --> 09:05.982
<i>(Tv playing indistinctly)</i> Friends?
I thought you wanted this thing for school.

09:06.100 --> 09:07.044
Dad liked your friend idea,

09:07.169 --> 09:08.960
but he thinks the iPad
should be used more for school.

09:09.078 --> 09:10.345
You're doing fine in school.

09:10.467 --> 09:12.654
Yeah, but in middle school,
the workload really picks up.

09:12.784 --> 09:13.947
Well,
if it's for middle school,

09:14.084 --> 09:15.799
we'll talk about it
when you get to middle school.

09:15.915 --> 09:18.067
Mom says she sees it as more
of a middle school thing.

09:18.221 --> 09:20.284
Yeah, well, middle school
is a long way off, isn't it?

09:20.404 --> 09:21.665
(Door closes) Dad's on board
with getting the iPad,

09:21.790 --> 09:24.088
- but he thinks middle school
is a long way off. - Really?

09:24.215 --> 09:26.133
- He really said that?
- Hey, mom,

09:26.265 --> 09:28.358
- can we go to Red Lobster
for dinner tonight? - No.

09:28.480 --> 09:30.967
Yeah, that's what dad said.
He absolutely said that.

09:31.084 --> 09:32.906
Why not? You're always saying
we should do more as a family.

09:33.044 --> 09:34.592
We are gonna do something
as a family.

09:34.735 --> 09:37.086
We are eating defrosted pot pies
from the Frugal Hoosier

09:37.208 --> 09:38.534
and watching "Dance Moms."

09:38.675 --> 09:40.643
Yeah, I just don't think that's
a very good idea for tonight.

09:40.782 --> 09:42.585
So, since dad thought
middle school was so far away,

09:42.705 --> 09:44.566
I was just thinking you guys
could give me the iPad

09:44.693 --> 09:45.987
for my graduation present.

09:46.118 --> 09:47.819
(Sighs) Are you still talking
about this?

09:47.929 --> 09:49.119
Wouldn't red lobster be
a great place

09:49.256 --> 09:51.109
for the family to talk
about their day?

09:51.221 --> 09:54.140
(Singsongy) You know, in case
somebody has some news.

09:54.248 --> 09:55.747
What do you think?
Graduation gift?

09:55.868 --> 09:57.253
I don't know, Brick.
We'll see.

09:57.356 --> 09:58.928
- We'll see for graduation?
- Sure.

09:59.062 --> 10:00.096
Don't believe her, Brick.

10:00.228 --> 10:02.360
"We'll see" is mom for
"we're never going out to eat

10:02.463 --> 10:03.936
'cause for some reason,
we hate our kids

10:04.056 --> 10:06.184
and delicious,
reasonably priced seafood."

10:06.291 --> 10:07.205
Is that true, mom?

10:07.323 --> 10:08.949
Stop bugging me, both of you.

10:09.059 --> 10:10.284
We are not talking
about the iPad,

10:10.417 --> 10:12.429
and we are not going
to Red Lobster.

10:14.139 --> 10:16.077
Look, I never claimed
to be strong.

10:16.193 --> 10:17.617
It really has something
for everybody.

10:17.781 --> 10:20.626
I mean, mom, you can watch
"The Bachelor" anytime you want.

10:20.749 --> 10:22.441
- And, dad, you can--
- No one cares, Brick,

10:22.572 --> 10:25.570
but I think people might be
quite interested in this news.

10:25.743 --> 10:28.278
I'm sitting in class today
when my phone buzzes,

10:28.397 --> 10:30.102
- and I notice I have an e-mail that says--
- Excuse me.

10:30.228 --> 10:32.001
Can I get you folks
started with some drinks?

10:32.141 --> 10:34.110
Um... we'll have a couple
of pops

10:34.242 --> 10:35.528
and water for these people.

10:35.723 --> 10:38.501
Can I interest anyone in some
bacon-wrapped shrimp tonight?

10:38.643 --> 10:40.598
You wrap anything in bacon,
we'll eat it.

10:45.228 --> 10:48.622
- As I was saying-- - Allow me to show
you this Powerpoint presentation

10:48.771 --> 10:50.356
of why I should get my iPad now

10:50.497 --> 10:52.353
instead of waiting
for graduation.

10:53.449 --> 10:55.039
Graduation?
What are you talking about?

10:55.155 --> 10:56.800
Mom, said I could get one
for graduation.

10:56.942 --> 10:59.252
Now keep in mind that
this would look a lot better

10:59.409 --> 11:01.707
if it were presented
on an actual iPad.

11:03.063 --> 11:05.047
You said that?
What's the matter with you?

11:05.165 --> 11:08.266
I don't know. He was bugging me
when I was trying to study.

11:08.372 --> 11:10.740
I probably just said it
to get rid of him.

11:13.263 --> 11:15.437
(Mutters) - What?
(Axl) - Speaking of graduation,

11:15.598 --> 11:18.975
I have some interesting news.
Today in class, I'm--

11:19.105 --> 11:21.202
(People)

11:21.375 --> 11:23.680

11:31.939 --> 11:33.695

11:33.796 --> 11:34.948
As I was saying,

11:35.081 --> 11:36.624
uh...
(Continues crying)

11:37.690 --> 11:40.521
(Exhales deeply) - Everybody-- - So since
we have established that you agree

11:40.656 --> 11:42.426
that the iPad would be
great for graduation--

11:42.549 --> 11:45.271
What the hell is going on?
We're out on a Wednesday night.

11:45.389 --> 11:47.184
We're talking about iPads.
Who are we?

11:47.331 --> 11:49.265
New rule--
no one asks for anything

11:49.378 --> 11:50.976
unless we're both in the room.

11:51.081 --> 11:52.800
Okay, so can I have an iPad?

11:52.909 --> 11:54.043
- No.
- No.

11:54.164 --> 11:56.412
So today I found out that--

11:56.526 --> 11:59.911
Wilson family, we got
a huge surprise for you.

12:00.270 --> 12:02.145
Mom? Dad?

12:02.258 --> 12:04.124
- I'm home!
(Woman) - Oh!

12:04.588 --> 12:07.168
(Applause) (All chanting) USA!
USA!

12:07.286 --> 12:12.300
USA! USA! USA! USA!

12:13.079 --> 12:15.392
(Frankie) Okay, everybody,
teeth and bed.

12:16.311 --> 12:17.980
See you guys in the morning.

12:18.131 --> 12:21.553
Oh, and by the way, got accepted
to East Indiana State.

12:21.680 --> 12:23.223
- What?
- Is that true?

12:23.567 --> 12:24.554
Mm-hmm.

12:24.678 --> 12:26.163
- Seriously?
- You got in? You really got in?

12:26.291 --> 12:28.527
Are you messing with me? 'Cause
you do not wanna mess with me.

12:28.646 --> 12:30.654
- Ask our former mailman.
- Don't mess with your mother.

12:30.782 --> 12:33.417
Okay, no, don't hurt me.
I got in. I totally got in.

12:33.536 --> 12:34.705
- Aah!
- Aah!

12:34.874 --> 12:36.233
(Both laughing)

12:36.358 --> 12:37.836
(Laughs)

12:38.228 --> 12:38.980
Hey!

12:39.108 --> 12:40.408
Come on! Come on!

12:40.549 --> 12:41.923
Whoo! (Laughs)

12:42.026 --> 12:43.831
Hey, as long as you guys
are in a good mood...

12:43.996 --> 12:45.482
- No!
- No!

12:47.165 --> 12:49.141
(All laughing)

12:49.300 --> 12:50.476
(Frankie) Yahoo!

12:57.293 --> 12:58.721
What up, fellow collegians?

12:58.837 --> 13:00.518
Hey, do I have something
on my hat?

13:01.080 --> 13:02.464
Dude! You got in.

13:03.046 --> 13:06.304
Boss Co.'s going to college.
College hug.

13:06.508 --> 13:07.748
(Laughs)

13:08.696 --> 13:09.633
Oh, okay.

13:09.752 --> 13:11.224
All right. So, look,
I'm sorry

13:11.341 --> 13:12.535
if I was sort of a jerk before,

13:12.654 --> 13:14.933
but now that I'm officially...
(Singsongy) in college...

13:15.048 --> 13:16.798
(Normal voice) the prank
is back on. We're gonna--

13:16.913 --> 13:18.702
Cement a golf cart
to the stairs?

13:18.874 --> 13:20.468
Uh, no. No.
No, no, no, no.

13:20.571 --> 13:21.483
We're gonna--

13:21.591 --> 13:23.275
Let a wild bobcat
loose in the school?

13:23.978 --> 13:25.016
Darrin.

13:25.251 --> 13:26.907
Sorry.
I just love guessing.

13:27.014 --> 13:30.304
Gentlemen, we're going to
climb the Orson water tower

13:30.428 --> 13:33.063
and use paint to change
the word "Orson"

13:33.181 --> 13:34.518
to-- preemptive high five--

13:34.628 --> 13:36.514
- "Snore-son"!
- Dude!

13:36.623 --> 13:37.638
- That's epic.
- Yeah.

13:37.759 --> 13:38.838
And then right beneath
"snore-son,"

13:38.946 --> 13:41.277
we're gonna write
"2013-- seniors rule."

13:41.406 --> 13:42.975
And do you know why?
Because...

13:43.115 --> 13:45.063
(Both) - Seniors rule!
- Huh!

13:45.409 --> 13:46.633
(Both grunt) Yes!

13:46.761 --> 13:48.513
- Let's do this.
- ♪ Ahh ♪

13:49.467 --> 13:51.698
Well, I trust that all of you
are well ensconced

13:51.825 --> 13:53.994
in your experiments.
Now when I call your name,

13:54.153 --> 13:57.385
you will state your hypothesis
and bring me up to date

13:57.518 --> 13:59.156
on your experiment.

13:59.615 --> 14:00.950
Miss Heck?

14:01.360 --> 14:04.074
Well... um--

14:04.185 --> 14:07.765
"Well, um" is not an hypothesis.

14:08.091 --> 14:09.152
Miss Moore?

14:09.283 --> 14:12.099
My hypothesis is that
some marinade ingredients

14:12.217 --> 14:14.007
might block
carcinogenic compounds

14:14.128 --> 14:15.842
from forming on meat
when it's grilled.

14:15.977 --> 14:18.609
I'm currently looking at
which ingredients would inhibit

14:18.724 --> 14:21.393
PHIP formation,
'cause if I can find a way

14:21.515 --> 14:23.306
to decrease carcinogens
from our diet,

14:23.455 --> 14:25.832
I might have found a way
to prevent cancer.

14:26.062 --> 14:26.923
Whew.

14:28.223 --> 14:29.452
Miss Heck?

14:29.579 --> 14:32.734
Um, well... my hypothesis...

14:32.865 --> 14:36.565
is that smiling is contagious.

14:36.703 --> 14:38.484
(Laughter)

14:38.752 --> 14:40.471
(Exhales deeply)
It's more than you think.

14:40.591 --> 14:42.935
You see,
the purpose of this project

14:43.066 --> 14:46.122
is to prove that
when one individual smiles,

14:46.268 --> 14:49.903
it will elicit a similar smile
from another human,

14:50.038 --> 14:55.061
thereby decreasing levels
of worldwide...

14:55.602 --> 14:57.643
unhappiness.

14:58.640 --> 14:59.991
Well, then.

15:00.104 --> 15:02.528
The rest of you will have
to tell me your hypothesis later

15:02.651 --> 15:07.195
because I have to dust off
the Nobel prize for Miss Heck.

15:07.322 --> 15:09.521
Let me warn you...

15:10.292 --> 15:12.749
if this is the direction
you're going,

15:12.938 --> 15:16.773
you... better... "wow" me.

15:17.430 --> 15:21.619
("Smile" playing)

15:23.866 --> 15:29.623
(Man) ♪ Smile though your
heart is aching ♪ (Crying)

15:29.742 --> 15:33.878

it's breaking ♪

15:34.007 --> 15:39.001

15:41.638 --> 15:44.183
Well, I'm gonna hit the hay.
Good night. Whoop!

15:44.302 --> 15:45.879
- Good night.
- Good night.

15:46.353 --> 15:49.130
- Oh.
- Mm.

15:51.311 --> 15:53.043
Did you notice Brick
hasn't asked about the iPad

15:53.173 --> 15:54.076
in two days?

15:54.191 --> 15:57.227
75 times a day for a month,
and then nothin'. Go figure.

15:57.358 --> 15:59.323
Huh. I think he finally
got the message

15:59.452 --> 16:01.510
that when we say no,
we mean it,

16:01.614 --> 16:02.696
and you know
what's that called?

16:02.804 --> 16:03.811
Uh, a miracle.

16:03.914 --> 16:06.532
Nope. That is called
good parenting.

16:09.840 --> 16:14.371
Truth is they're actually
not that expensive.

16:14.504 --> 16:15.442
What?

16:15.561 --> 16:17.983
Well, I saw one
for 87 bucks on eBay.

16:18.116 --> 16:19.560
I saw one for less than that.

16:19.665 --> 16:21.365
First Generation, Refurbished.

16:21.512 --> 16:23.112
I guess it was in
some kind of fire.

16:23.631 --> 16:24.376
Mm.

16:24.491 --> 16:26.310
The thing is,
he does read a lot.

16:26.424 --> 16:28.383
If we got him one--
I'm not saying we would--

16:28.515 --> 16:30.468
we would never have
to buy him another book.

16:30.578 --> 16:32.153
Or drive him to the library.

16:32.632 --> 16:35.736
He really is a great kid.
He doesn't ask for a lot.

16:35.862 --> 16:37.871
He's willing to share it.
He said himself.

16:37.985 --> 16:38.902
The whole family could use it.

16:39.001 --> 16:40.322
And since Axl got
that scholarship,

16:40.436 --> 16:42.772
we do have
a little bit of cash.

16:42.965 --> 16:44.537
Can you imagine
how surprised he'd be

16:44.648 --> 16:47.290
- if we actually gave it to him?
- He'd go nuts.

16:49.263 --> 16:50.476
Let's do it.

16:50.831 --> 16:52.705
(Man) Timber!

16:55.423 --> 16:57.297
(Train whistle blowing
in distance)

16:57.859 --> 16:59.981
(Clank) Ha ha ha.

17:00.209 --> 17:01.497
(Laughs)

17:01.694 --> 17:03.161
Whoo!

17:03.314 --> 17:04.689
Seniors rule!

17:04.824 --> 17:05.910
(Laughs) Ahh.

17:06.597 --> 17:08.827
- Wow.
- Whoa.

17:09.256 --> 17:10.607
Letters are huge.

17:10.712 --> 17:11.900
Hells, yeah, they are.

17:12.021 --> 17:14.087
That's why tomorrow,
the whole city is gonna see

17:14.213 --> 17:17.800
the greatest senior prank
in the history of prankage.

17:17.916 --> 17:19.178
(Laughs)

17:19.667 --> 17:23.444
Hey, look, it says
"class of '92 seniors rule."

17:23.608 --> 17:24.970
(Scoffs) How can <i>that</i> be?

17:25.107 --> 17:26.921
Yeah. We'll paint over that.

17:27.054 --> 17:29.340
- Okay, let's <i>do</i> this.
- Yeah.

17:29.451 --> 17:30.569
Where's the paint?

17:30.670 --> 17:32.958
- Uh-oh.
- What?

17:33.278 --> 17:34.550
Darrin, the last time
you said "uh-oh,"

17:34.655 --> 17:36.538
the paramedics had
to cut my jeans off me.

17:36.647 --> 17:37.715
I forgot the paint.

17:37.825 --> 17:40.731
<i>Dude,</i> your-- your family
owns a paint store.

17:40.874 --> 17:42.178
(Sighs) I think I
might have a sharpie.

17:42.288 --> 17:44.020
Do you know how long it would
take to write "snore-son"

17:44.138 --> 17:45.551
with a sharpie?

17:45.663 --> 17:46.876
Three days. A week?

17:46.974 --> 17:49.063
No. Stop guessing. (Sighs)

17:50.127 --> 17:51.387
(Clatters)

17:51.822 --> 17:53.367
So much for being legendary.

17:57.685 --> 17:59.169
Whoa. Check it out.

17:59.291 --> 18:00.938
I think I can see your house.

18:01.089 --> 18:02.044
Really?

18:02.195 --> 18:03.443
Right there.

18:03.919 --> 18:05.892
Hey, there's the Meenahans'
house.

18:06.285 --> 18:10.395
Oh. (Laughs) Oh. (Laughs)
You remember after they moved,

18:10.507 --> 18:12.157
we snuck into their yard
and dared this guy

18:12.277 --> 18:13.820
to jump from their oak tree
to their roof?

18:13.938 --> 18:16.249
I have never seen anyone
hit a sidewalk that hard.

18:16.473 --> 18:17.992
I remember that.

18:18.106 --> 18:19.547
I'll never forget that.

18:20.145 --> 18:21.690
I don't remember that.

18:22.186 --> 18:23.972
Whoa, is that the school?

18:24.317 --> 18:25.947
It looks so tiny from up here.

18:26.077 --> 18:28.927
Yeah. Felt so big
when we were freshmen.

18:30.074 --> 18:32.241
- And there's the football field.
- Yep.

18:32.558 --> 18:35.198
You always said that
we'd win a city championship

18:35.317 --> 18:36.932
on that field, and we did.

18:37.342 --> 18:39.335
You also said you'd feel
Julie O'Connor's boobs

18:39.488 --> 18:40.426
on that field.

18:40.534 --> 18:43.294
- Mm.
- Well, one for two ain't bad, huh?

18:43.976 --> 18:45.556
You only felt one of 'em?

18:45.665 --> 18:47.948
(Sighs) Remind me not to have
you fix my air conditioner.

18:48.089 --> 18:49.231
(Snorts)

18:50.268 --> 18:51.327
(Chuckles)

18:52.553 --> 18:53.680
Hmm.

18:54.223 --> 18:55.864
Can't believe we're done.

18:56.632 --> 18:58.130
What do you mean, done?

19:00.889 --> 19:02.198
In a couple months,

19:02.612 --> 19:04.990
we're all gonna be going
to different schools.

19:06.669 --> 19:07.899
Hmm.

19:08.024 --> 19:09.520
You know what?

19:10.497 --> 19:12.475
I'm glad Darrin
forgot the paint.

19:12.606 --> 19:15.398
'Cause Orson was never
snore-son while we were here.

19:16.655 --> 19:17.972
Damn straight.

19:18.091 --> 19:19.350
We rocked this town.

19:19.468 --> 19:21.261
Epic. (Laughs)

19:21.815 --> 19:22.964
(Clatter)

19:23.265 --> 19:24.667
I just lost a shoe.

19:36.000 --> 19:37.874
Well, how did we do, Miss Heck?

19:37.994 --> 19:39.327
I guess you'll tell <i>me.</i>

19:39.507 --> 19:42.253
Class, while I grade
all your fine work,

19:42.385 --> 19:44.821
you can continue reading
chapter 23.

19:45.071 --> 19:48.933
If you finish, you can proceed
to chapter 24. (Pen clicks)

19:49.160 --> 19:51.254
<i>(Sue) Is smiling contagious?</i>

19:51.364 --> 19:53.715
<i>After many attempts</i>
<i>with multiple subjects,</i>

19:53.842 --> 19:57.094
<i>including family, friends,</i>
<i>a Red Lobster waitress,</i>

19:57.210 --> 19:58.678
<i>and an unfriendly baby,</i>

19:58.896 --> 20:03.983
<i>I, unfortunately, was unable</i>
<i>to prove my hypothesis.</i>

20:04.099 --> 20:06.575
<i>However, like many scientists</i>
<i>before me,</i>

20:06.709 --> 20:08.694
<i>I refuse to admit defeat.</i>

20:08.799 --> 20:13.044
<i>It took Einstein ten years</i>
<i>to prove E=mc2,</i>

20:13.161 --> 20:16.263
<i>and if it takes me that long</i>
<i>to prove smiling is contagious,</i>

20:16.390 --> 20:18.354
<i>then I am up for the challenge,</i>

20:18.469 --> 20:21.854
<i>for I believe there are</i>
<i>some things that defy logic.</i>

20:21.961 --> 20:23.612
No way! An iPad?!

20:23.789 --> 20:25.213
And it's the one from the fire?

20:25.432 --> 20:29.419
(Laughs) Oh, this is better
than being a good parent.

20:30.369 --> 20:32.543
<i>French anatomist Duchenne</i>
<i>wrote that</i>

20:32.661 --> 20:35.706
<i>"Joy is expressed on the face</i>
<i>by contraction of the muscles,</i>

20:35.836 --> 20:38.530
<i>but it can only be put in play</i>

20:38.657 --> 20:41.194
<i>by the sweet emotions</i>
<i>of the soul."</i>

20:41.292 --> 20:42.566
Gonna miss you guys.

20:42.915 --> 20:44.611
Okay. I'm just
gonna say it.

20:45.064 --> 20:46.437
I love you.

20:46.549 --> 20:48.958
- Oh. Oh, I--
- Okay, Darrin just made it weird.

20:49.066 --> 20:51.633
I'm sorry. (Voice breaking)
I'm very emotional right now.

20:51.746 --> 20:53.916
Yeah. Dude, come on, man.
(Laughs)

20:54.087 --> 20:57.226
<i>And Duchenne had a whole smile</i>
<i>named after him.</i>

20:57.328 --> 20:58.703
<i>Think of the smiles</i>
<i>over the years</i>

20:58.817 --> 21:01.573
<i>that have inspired</i>
<i>a whole world to happiness--</i>

21:01.678 --> 21:04.593
<i>Mona Lisa's, Justin Bieber's.</i>

21:04.709 --> 21:06.438
<i>Some might laugh at me, I know,</i>

21:06.546 --> 21:08.507
<i>just as they laughed</i>
<i>at John Gurdon.</i>

21:08.629 --> 21:11.832
<i>He was told in high school that</i>
<i>he would never be a scientist.</i>

21:11.982 --> 21:14.576
<i>He just won the Nobel prize.</i>

21:14.706 --> 21:17.633
<i>I guess it just proves that</i>
<i>being dismissed by people</i>

21:17.754 --> 21:19.117
<i>who think they know better</i>

21:19.225 --> 21:22.744
<i>is not an obstacle to winning</i>
<i>a Nobel prize.</i>

21:22.897 --> 21:25.439
<i>So I will continue</i>
<i>with my research--</i>

21:25.553 --> 21:27.350
<i>one smile at a time,</i>

21:27.464 --> 21:31.528
<i>until I prove</i>
<i>that smiling</i> is <i>contagious,</i>

21:31.653 --> 21:35.339
<i>'cause I don't wanna live</i>
<i>in a world where it isn't.</i>
