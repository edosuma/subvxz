WEBVTT

00:00.953 --> 00:02.178
He-Man.

00:02.220 --> 00:06.478
And the Masters of the Universe.

00:06.520 --> 00:08.378
I am Adam, Prince of Eternia.

00:08.420 --> 00:09.539
Defender of the

00:09.564 --> 00:11.778
secrets of Castle Grayskull.

00:11.820 --> 00:15.943
This is Cringer, my fearless friend.

00:15.986 --> 00:17.844
Fabulous secret powers were revealed

00:17.869 --> 00:19.978
to me the day I held aloft

00:20.020 --> 00:22.154
my magic sword and said,

00:22.179 --> 00:24.668
by the power of Grayskull.

00:27.420 --> 00:31.578
I have the power!

00:38.786 --> 00:39.913
Cringer became the

00:39.938 --> 00:41.978
mighty Battle Cat, and I became

00:42.020 --> 00:43.876
He-Man, the most

00:43.901 --> 00:46.402
powerful man in the universe.

00:49.286 --> 00:51.778
Only three others share this secret:

00:52.620 --> 00:54.851
Our friends the Sorceress,

00:54.876 --> 00:56.911
Man-at-Arms, and Orko.

00:56.935 --> 00:59.588
Together we defend Castle Grayskull from,

00:59.613 --> 01:02.117
the evil forces of Skeletor.

01:47.922 --> 01:48.922
Adam,

01:48.947 --> 01:51.745
we're never going to find
the city of the Ancient Ones.

01:53.852 --> 01:56.013
Never say never, Orko.

02:04.929 --> 02:08.830
Then we're hardly ever
going to find it, alright?

02:10.869 --> 02:14.327
Oops! And be careful when you
say, 'Alright'.

02:19.878 --> 02:22.278
Let's move on.
According to what the Sorceress told us...

02:22.514 --> 02:24.414
we should be very near.

02:28.520 --> 02:30.010
Wait for me.

02:32.257 --> 02:34.325
Orko, Man-At-Arms?

02:34.350 --> 02:35.842
We're here!

02:36.328 --> 02:38.455
The City of the Ancients.

02:44.236 --> 02:47.000
There's some kind of power in the air...

02:47.373 --> 02:50.069
I feel it.
I'm not sure it's friendly either.

02:51.877 --> 02:54.778
The Ancient Ones did have
incredible power, Orko...

02:55.013 --> 02:58.039
power we must rediscover
and use for the good of all.

02:59.218 --> 03:00.651
Adam, Orko, look out.

03:09.762 --> 03:12.230
The Sorceress said,
the spirits of the last rulers...

03:12.431 --> 03:13.830
might be haunting this place.

03:15.033 --> 03:16.364
You don't suppose these are...

03:16.568 --> 03:19.264
Evil Wizard, Demos,
and his Witch Queen Tyrella...

03:19.538 --> 03:22.336
the last rulers of the
City of the Ancients.

03:26.245 --> 03:28.145
That bird gives me the creeps.

03:34.453 --> 03:38.116
My robot bird has tracked them perfectly.

03:38.290 --> 03:40.121
The power of Demos soon will be mine.

03:40.893 --> 03:43.384
Where are Beast Man and Evil-Lyn?

03:43.662 --> 03:46.153
My warriors are never
around when I need them.

03:49.234 --> 03:51.134
Skeletor? Who are you?

03:51.470 --> 03:52.470
My name is Aran,

03:52.671 --> 03:55.003
and I am, Una.

03:55.240 --> 03:56.838
We've learned much
from your warriors.

03:56.863 --> 03:58.860
Now we want to prove
our worth to you.

03:59.711 --> 04:03.807
Let us do your bidding.
Whatever you ask, we shall accomplish.

04:04.349 --> 04:08.149
Indeed? Let's see if
you're worthy to serve me.

04:17.563 --> 04:20.361
Very clever, that was quick thinking.

04:20.531 --> 04:21.624
What else can you do?

04:25.938 --> 04:28.099
Yes, your magic is strong.

04:28.340 --> 04:29.705
No more tests, Skeletor.

04:31.743 --> 04:34.871
Very good, young one.
I like your spirit.

04:35.113 --> 04:37.240
Now, kneel before your master!

04:37.749 --> 04:40.240
Are you sure this is what we want, Aran?

04:40.552 --> 04:43.646
Yes, serving Skeletor will
lead to power and glory.

04:43.922 --> 04:45.184
Now, do as he says.

04:48.794 --> 04:53.221
It is done, your task is to journey
to the City of the Ancients...

04:53.332 --> 04:57.099
and return with the
power masks of Demos.

04:57.102 --> 05:02.130
But that is impossible. The City of
the Ancients has been lost for centuries.

05:02.407 --> 05:06.673
It was,
but Prince Adam just found it for us.

05:18.423 --> 05:21.392
Well Adam, do you think any of these relics
contain the secrets...

05:21.627 --> 05:22.719
we're looking for?

05:25.564 --> 05:27.054
Hey! Get me outta here!

05:27.766 --> 05:30.633
What do you think, Duncan?
Should we leave him in there?

05:31.303 --> 05:35.501
Not a bad idea, unless of course,
he intended to help with dinner.

05:35.908 --> 05:37.535
Alright, I'll help.

05:40.012 --> 05:42.537
Orko, bring me that pot of water.

05:42.748 --> 05:44.215
Sure thing, Man-At-Arms.

05:46.919 --> 05:51.117
Orko, can't you ever do anything
like a normal alien? Be careful.

05:51.456 --> 05:55.153
Don't worry, Man-At-Arms.
I've got it totally under control.

05:58.664 --> 06:01.055
Totally under control, eh?

06:01.333 --> 06:05.867
Did you see it?
That awful , that terrifying face!

06:05.971 --> 06:08.235
Only awful thing I saw was your magic.

06:08.440 --> 06:11.967
Orko must have triggered some
ancient power. Try something else.

06:16.044 --> 06:17.480
Pot rise in air.

06:19.585 --> 06:22.452
Oh well, I've been wrong before.

06:24.756 --> 06:27.316
Help, they're after me.

06:31.363 --> 06:34.230
I guess Adam was right after all, eh Orko?

06:34.533 --> 06:35.693
Oh, just my luck.

06:39.304 --> 06:40.896
Prince Adam is right in there.

06:41.139 --> 06:45.537
He doesn't know that the room he's
looking for, is right under his feet.

06:49.348 --> 06:52.146
Here's the entrance.
Can you lift this, Aran?

06:52.317 --> 06:54.649
If it leads to power, no task is too great!

07:04.363 --> 07:06.763
Lumino, cranda.

07:09.201 --> 07:10.327
This way.

07:14.239 --> 07:16.571
Let's take a look outside.

07:16.775 --> 07:18.868
I have a strange feeling,
that we've got company.

07:26.852 --> 07:29.013
Look, someone is down there!

07:31.757 --> 07:34.248
I say we drop in on these mystery guests...

07:34.459 --> 07:38.327
and see if they're friends or... enemies.

07:38.697 --> 07:40.358
I wish you hadn't said that.

07:51.643 --> 07:55.773
I feel the Ancient Ones, they call to us.

07:57.849 --> 07:59.373
The Masks of Power.

08:01.887 --> 08:02.945
They're alive!

08:06.158 --> 08:07.318
Hear that noise?

08:07.526 --> 08:09.357
Something's about to happen to us.

08:12.030 --> 08:16.865
As soon as we put the masks on,
the power will be all ours.

08:17.769 --> 08:18.769
Stop!

08:18.804 --> 08:22.365
You don't know what you're doing!
You must not put the mask's on.

08:22.442 --> 08:24.534
Aran umm... maybe we shouldn't.

08:24.810 --> 08:27.142
We must seize the power for Skeletor.

08:31.917 --> 08:33.475
Look, they've changed.

08:33.652 --> 08:35.745
Just as the Sorceress warned...

08:36.020 --> 08:40.116
The poor fools have been possessed by
the spirits of Demos and his Witch Queen.

08:41.058 --> 08:46.429
Yes, we are back and no
one shall stop us again.

08:49.234 --> 08:51.566
Orko, Man-At-Arms, look out!

08:56.842 --> 08:59.743
I think it's time I
made a change of my own.

09:03.348 --> 09:05.839
By the power of Grayskull.

09:12.257 --> 09:16.751
I have the power!

09:22.267 --> 09:25.361
Aha! Another enemy has come to test us.

09:27.272 --> 09:31.038
Not for long.
The power square will hold him.

09:31.643 --> 09:33.304
We'll see about that.

09:38.817 --> 09:40.348
Enough of this play...

09:40.418 --> 09:43.581
The time has come to claim
the Sword of the Ancients.

09:43.889 --> 09:46.585
I hate to mention this,
but I think you're trapped.

09:46.858 --> 09:51.795
Correction, mortal,
we have nowehere to go... but up.

09:54.266 --> 09:55.665
I'll get 'em, He-Man.

09:55.901 --> 09:56.925
Orko, no!

09:57.636 --> 09:59.228
Stop, I command you!

10:07.078 --> 10:08.943
He-Man, they're getting away.

10:09.314 --> 10:12.943
Don't worry. We'll see you're kept busy.

10:16.188 --> 10:17.849
Busy indeed.

10:17.956 --> 10:23.219
I, Demos, command Aroo,
the Protector of the Masks...

10:23.295 --> 10:24.785
to awake!

10:25.197 --> 10:27.529
That doesn't sound very encouraging.

10:28.733 --> 10:30.598
That sounds even worse.

10:39.077 --> 10:42.069
Orko, you better float out of here.

10:42.881 --> 10:46.977
I, I can't, that blast must
have knocked out my powers.

10:48.186 --> 10:49.186
Orko!

10:52.123 --> 10:54.091
He-Man, thank you.

10:54.392 --> 10:58.886
I'm always happy to give you a
hand, or get you out of one.

10:59.764 --> 11:02.534
Orko, you've got to get the rope,

11:02.534 --> 11:04.092
and drop the rest of us a line.

11:10.508 --> 11:14.410
I better get back, before that
over-sized beastie makes He-Man mad.

11:16.781 --> 11:18.544
He-Man, he's got me.

11:18.783 --> 11:20.341
Wanna arm wrestle.

11:30.962 --> 11:32.486
Coming, guys!

11:36.701 --> 11:38.362
Oh no, it's too short.

11:38.870 --> 11:41.464
I'd say we have a problem, a big one.

11:56.655 --> 11:58.919
Duncan, up the wall, quick.

12:01.593 --> 12:03.527
You don't have to say that again.

12:10.001 --> 12:12.060
Sorry we can't stay and play...

12:12.270 --> 12:13.999
but it's past your bedtime.

12:23.949 --> 12:27.385
I hope the Sorceress can tell us
where Demos and Tyrella have gone,

12:27.619 --> 12:30.213
and, why they've come back to life.

12:30.322 --> 12:32.256
Castle Grayskull!

12:34.225 --> 12:37.023
Demos and Tyrella seek the
Sword of the Ancients...

12:37.228 --> 12:38.855
and they must be stopped.

12:39.431 --> 12:42.059
I thought that sword was only a legend.

12:42.233 --> 12:46.329
Demos and Tyrella were only
legends themselves, until today.

12:49.472 --> 12:52.608
Many centuries ago,
The Sword of the Ancients was thrust...

12:52.643 --> 12:57.303
into a boulder of pure quartz,
deep beneath Snake Mountain itself.

12:57.482 --> 13:00.246
That is where you will
find Demos and Tyrella.

13:00.952 --> 13:04.353
Skeletor's not gonna be
too happy about us dropping...

13:04.589 --> 13:05.851
in on his headquarters!

13:06.091 --> 13:09.288
Orko, maybe you better stay
here and help defend Grayskull.

13:09.561 --> 13:10.561
Good idea.

13:10.795 --> 13:12.126
If you insist.

13:12.364 --> 13:16.425
Skeletor knows nothing of the
sword's location, which is fortunate...

13:16.768 --> 13:21.705
because next to your magic sword,
it is the most powerful weapon in Eternia.

13:21.940 --> 13:24.841
Demos and his Witch Queen must not succeed.

13:33.885 --> 13:37.082
Snake Mountain.  At last.

13:37.422 --> 13:40.687
The Sword of the Ancients
calls from its hiding place.

13:41.092 --> 13:42.889
It will not be long now.

13:43.395 --> 13:47.354
Who dares to enter the domain of Skeletor ?

13:48.166 --> 13:51.567
Who is this Skeletor?
He looks familiar.

13:51.870 --> 13:53.701
It is of no matter, my queen.

13:54.005 --> 14:00.308
Skeletor, I think it is time you show
better manners to your new masters.

14:00.545 --> 14:03.105
I command you to bow to us.

14:03.715 --> 14:07.549
I  bow to no one.

14:08.486 --> 14:10.221
Is that so?

14:10.221 --> 14:11.882
We shall see.

14:22.033 --> 14:25.730
I see you decided, to bow after all.

14:27.505 --> 14:31.305
No one defies Skeletor.

14:32.310 --> 14:33.436
Oh no?

14:40.585 --> 14:44.289
Let's go. He maybe
dangerous, once he gets free.

14:44.289 --> 14:46.450
I feel the pull of the Sword.

14:47.992 --> 14:49.220
This way.

14:51.696 --> 14:53.789
Let me out.

14:57.869 --> 15:01.305
There was no door there, before.
What's going on?

15:08.913 --> 15:09.913
He-Man!

15:10.081 --> 15:12.777
You look right at home behind
bars, Skeletor.

15:12.917 --> 15:13.917
Let me out.

15:13.918 --> 15:16.648
Looks like you've had some company.

15:16.721 --> 15:17.721
Tell us where they went.

15:18.923 --> 15:22.415
Why not?
The four of you can battle it out...

15:22.494 --> 15:24.792
but only if you free me.

15:25.130 --> 15:26.961
Alright, where are they?

15:27.031 --> 15:28.828
They went through that wall.

15:30.668 --> 15:32.295
Now, keep your word.

15:33.337 --> 15:36.698
I hate to do this, but I did give my word.

15:38.877 --> 15:42.677
You'll never get through that wall.
It's forty feet thick.

15:42.947 --> 15:44.209
Oh, really?

15:49.387 --> 15:51.981
I'll be back. For you.

15:58.062 --> 16:04.023
It has taken us centuries. The Sword
of the Ancients shall be ours at last.

16:04.302 --> 16:06.167
Demos, look, the door!

16:07.205 --> 16:12.006
By the will of the Ancients,
we command thee, open!

16:15.813 --> 16:17.838
I hope we're not too late.

16:22.587 --> 16:26.990
Whatever Demos and He-Man seek,
must have incredible power.

16:28.326 --> 16:31.557
I can wait no longer,
I must have it for myself!

16:33.798 --> 16:37.063
This portal should take
me where I want to go.

16:41.005 --> 16:43.735
Behold, the Sword.

16:46.344 --> 16:51.043
And by the power of Grayskull,
beholding it is all you're going to do.

16:53.284 --> 16:55.616
I thought we had taken care of these two.

16:56.154 --> 16:58.918
Well, we will just have to
take care of them again.

17:05.396 --> 17:08.194
And you shall not escape either, He-Man.

17:12.436 --> 17:14.962
Uh oh!  That wall looks hungry,

17:19.743 --> 17:22.473
and now, for the sword.

17:26.751 --> 17:30.152
Sorry guys I think i gave the
wall a stomachache.

17:30.421 --> 17:32.252
I'll still stop you yet.

17:45.370 --> 17:47.463
Don't worry, I'll get us down.

17:47.839 --> 17:49.932
Demos, quick, take the Sword.

17:55.880 --> 17:57.177
He-Man, your Sword!

17:57.482 --> 17:58.482
No time now.

17:58.783 --> 18:03.516
I, Demos, claim the Sword of the Ancients.

18:10.361 --> 18:11.361
No!

18:19.904 --> 18:22.702
The sword is moving.

18:24.676 --> 18:25.836
No!

18:27.845 --> 18:31.713
I am the Sword of the Ancients,
and I have awakened to battle...

18:31.983 --> 18:34.144
for freedom and justice, once more.

18:34.452 --> 18:38.445
You may have achieved your quest,
He-Man, but I have your sword.

18:38.790 --> 18:41.657
Now, I want the Sword
of the Ancients as well.

18:44.495 --> 18:48.258
It was foretold that I would
join with another mighty sword...

18:48.599 --> 18:50.696
and that one has now appeared.

18:52.236 --> 18:53.897
May the two become one...

18:55.640 --> 18:58.308
and help He-Man defend Eternia.

19:01.913 --> 19:02.913
No!

19:04.482 --> 19:06.973
What... what's happening?

19:07.285 --> 19:10.281
The Power of Masks has
been destroyed, Aran.

19:10.355 --> 19:11.788
I'm... I'm me again!

19:12.123 --> 19:14.591
The very power we were looking
for, took us over...

19:14.892 --> 19:16.689
and controlled our spirits.

19:16.994 --> 19:21.090
Exactly, now you've seen what it
is to serve the forces of evil.

19:21.432 --> 19:22.490
Is that what you want?

19:22.767 --> 19:24.496
I want no part of it.

19:24.802 --> 19:27.430
You're right, Oona,
I made a terrible mistake.

19:27.672 --> 19:29.663
There's no glory in serving an evil power.

19:29.941 --> 19:31.609
You'll pay for betraying me.

19:31.609 --> 19:34.806
It's you, who'll be paying, Skeletor...

19:34.946 --> 19:36.038
in prison!

19:37.148 --> 19:38.979
Not this time, He-Man.

19:43.187 --> 19:46.350
Maybe not, but your time will come.

19:46.657 --> 19:50.058
He-Man, how can we make
up for what we've done?

19:50.328 --> 19:53.320
You've already taken the hardest
step by admitting you were wrong...

19:53.598 --> 19:54.929
It takes a lot of courage.

19:55.233 --> 19:57.827
We'll never serve the forces of evil again.

19:58.102 --> 20:00.866
It's a long way home. C'mon.

20:01.172 --> 20:03.834
Oh, you mean you'll take us with you?

20:04.175 --> 20:05.175
Of course!

20:12.049 --> 20:14.882
You're going to like the
bright side of Eternia.

20:18.122 --> 20:21.719
Funny, it seems brighter, already.

20:28.633 --> 20:32.467
All of us make mistakes.
And Oona and Aran made a big one.

20:32.804 --> 20:36.103
But when they realized what they had
done, they didn't lie about it,

20:36.307 --> 20:39.208
they didn't try to cover it up.
Instead they admitted it.

20:39.610 --> 20:43.046
As He-Man said,
admitting you're wrong takes courage.

20:43.414 --> 20:47.316
But when you do, you've taken the
first big step toward making up for it.

20:47.552 --> 20:50.146
Of course, if you're like
me, you never make a mistake.

20:50.221 --> 20:51.221
Orko...

20:51.756 --> 20:53.121
I guess I'd better disappear.

20:55.259 --> 20:56.749
Oops! I think I made a mistake.

20:57.305 --> 21:03.566
