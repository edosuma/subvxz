00:00.127 --> 00:02.025
No! The audition for "Chicago"!

00:02.027 --> 00:03.362
10:00 sharp.!

00:03.397 --> 00:06.299
- I can't believe it.
- I'm finally gonna get to really dance again.

00:06.333 --> 00:08.267
No. She's not right.

00:08.302 --> 00:10.369
- Marry me.
- Oh, Hubbell. No.

00:10.404 --> 00:12.705
Hubbell: <i>I live in this beautiful town</i>
<i>called Paradise.</i>

00:12.739 --> 00:13.739
<i>It's right on the coast.</i>

00:13.774 --> 00:15.575
- Mom.
- Yes. Mom.

00:15.609 --> 00:17.476
Wait, you live with your
mother like a serial killer?

00:17.511 --> 00:18.711
I know exactly what you want.

00:18.745 --> 00:20.646
You want to live an unexpected life.

00:20.681 --> 00:23.549
- And I intend to give you exactly that.
- Wow.

00:23.584 --> 00:26.619
This won't last. She's a Vegas girl.
Hubbell will bore her.

00:26.653 --> 00:28.454
Michelle: <i>She has a dance studio</i>
<i>in the back.</i>

00:28.488 --> 00:30.456
Her whole life is here.
You didn't tell me any of that.

00:30.490 --> 00:33.292
- So we heard you're a dancer.
- I trained at A.B.T.

00:33.327 --> 00:35.528
- Do you love him?
- I think I could fall in love with him.

00:35.562 --> 00:37.530
- Truly, what's the matter?
- <i>Hubbell.</i>

00:37.564 --> 00:39.432
We went driving

00:39.466 --> 00:40.700
looking for the two of you.

00:40.734 --> 00:42.768
<i>It just came out of nowhere.</i>

00:42.803 --> 00:44.337
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>

03:03.677 --> 03:05.244
Sasha: I don't know.

03:05.278 --> 03:07.346
Either path is fraught with peril.

03:07.381 --> 03:09.215
I know that if I ask for a car

03:09.249 --> 03:10.583
for my birthday, I'll get it.

03:10.617 --> 03:12.284
- How do you know?
- I know.

03:12.319 --> 03:14.353
I walked in on a really weird
fight they were having

03:14.388 --> 03:16.589
involving the guy who did our
landscaping and a fondue pot.

03:16.623 --> 03:18.357
- Weird.
- So weird.

03:18.392 --> 03:20.593
Anyhow, the minute they saw me
they totally clammed up.

03:20.627 --> 03:22.328
Which translates to busted,

03:22.362 --> 03:23.496
which translates to guilt,

03:23.530 --> 03:25.398
which translates to Beamer.

03:25.432 --> 03:26.699
However, I know that if I ask them

03:26.733 --> 03:28.601
for the car and then I receive said car

03:28.635 --> 03:30.436
I'm then indebted to them for the car,

03:30.470 --> 03:32.238
which means the next time
one of them asks,

03:32.272 --> 03:34.240
"does this outfit make me look fat"?

03:34.274 --> 03:35.574
I'm gonna have to look.

03:35.609 --> 03:37.576
I don't know. How bad is the bus?

03:37.611 --> 03:39.412
<i>Are you even</i> <i>listening to me?</i>

03:39.446 --> 03:41.247
Car, birthday, fondue pot,

03:41.281 --> 03:42.415
am I fat, quandary.

03:42.449 --> 03:44.283
- What are you doing?
- Reading the paper.

03:44.317 --> 03:46.318
- Who does that?
- I'm going to see my grandpa tonight

03:46.353 --> 03:47.620
and he likes me to read the paper to him.

03:47.654 --> 03:49.255
So read it to him then.

03:49.289 --> 03:51.257
I always pre-read it

03:51.291 --> 03:52.591
and circle the articles I think he'll like

03:52.626 --> 03:55.428
because time is an issue
at his age and he gets really upset

03:55.462 --> 03:57.530
if he falls asleep before
I get to Gail Collins.

03:57.564 --> 03:59.532
The class is out there, ladies.

03:59.566 --> 04:00.666
From our ballet teacher.

04:00.700 --> 04:02.668
Anything involving bats, helmets, rackets,

04:02.702 --> 04:05.304
goal lines, shin guards,
personal fouls or high fives

04:05.338 --> 04:07.540
could cause injury and
jeopardize our dance careers.

04:07.574 --> 04:10.576
- Basically anything that happens out there
is out. - Plus I have cramps.

04:12.279 --> 04:13.345
Why don't you just use an iPad?

04:13.380 --> 04:15.414
Tried to. He couldn't
grasp the concept of it.

04:15.449 --> 04:18.216
He just got angry and thought
I was making everything up.

04:18.250 --> 04:19.452
Ugh, the old.

04:19.486 --> 04:21.253
Promise you'll put a pillow over my face

04:21.288 --> 04:22.488
- when I turn 60?
- Will do.

04:22.522 --> 04:24.156
- Did you hear?
- Hear what?

04:24.191 --> 04:26.325
Ginny Thompson! Oh, jeez.

04:26.359 --> 04:27.593
- The announcement.
- Oh, you mean the one

04:27.627 --> 04:29.595
that went "blarsh ment
hucckles flaus ushconment"?

04:29.629 --> 04:31.363
- Yes, that's the one.
- Then yes, we heard it.

04:31.398 --> 04:32.498
<i>Want to know what it said?</i>

04:32.532 --> 04:34.233
Something to do with pink slime?

04:34.267 --> 04:36.335
Hubbell was in a car accident last night.

04:36.369 --> 04:37.636
- Madame Fanny's Hubbell?
- Yep.

04:37.671 --> 04:39.305
- Bad?
- Yep.

04:39.339 --> 04:41.440
- And?
- And... he's...

04:44.244 --> 04:45.244
What, he's what?

04:45.278 --> 04:47.246
- You know.
- I don't know.

04:49.483 --> 04:51.550
- I don't know what that look means.
- Melanie!

04:53.353 --> 04:55.588
- I don't know what that look means either.
- Think.

04:55.622 --> 04:58.190
Focus. Follow the information

04:58.225 --> 04:59.558
to its obvious conclusion.

04:59.593 --> 05:02.394
Hubbell, accident, two weird looks?

05:04.531 --> 05:07.366
Oh.

05:07.400 --> 05:09.301
Wow.

05:11.238 --> 05:12.238
Wow.

05:24.184 --> 05:25.551
- I need a tent.
- You...

05:25.585 --> 05:28.354
I've called three different tent
companies, but they're not open yet.

05:28.388 --> 05:30.489
You'd think there'd be
one 24-hour tent company

05:30.524 --> 05:32.525
somewhere in the world
if for no other reason,

05:32.559 --> 05:34.193
just for novelty's sake.

05:34.227 --> 05:35.394
What do you need a tent for?

05:35.428 --> 05:37.263
For the memorial.

05:37.297 --> 05:38.264
The...

05:38.298 --> 05:39.498
I don't do funerals.

05:39.533 --> 05:41.600
There's no celebration, no ode to life.

05:41.635 --> 05:44.170
Life is everything.
And life goes on, you know.

05:44.204 --> 05:46.272
Buddhists believe
that everyone comes back.

05:46.306 --> 05:48.607
Doesn't that feat alone
deserve a really great party?

05:48.642 --> 05:50.309
Of course it does.

05:50.343 --> 05:53.212
It's going to be a traditional
Buddhist ceremony.

05:53.246 --> 05:54.647
Dignified, spiritual,

05:54.681 --> 05:55.648
not sappy.

05:55.682 --> 05:58.250
We'll need candles and incense,

05:58.285 --> 06:00.486
and a beautiful Book for people
to write their thoughts in.

06:00.520 --> 06:02.388
I think it's going to rain tomorrow,

06:02.422 --> 06:03.589
so I'll have to have it on Sunday,

06:03.623 --> 06:06.192
though I wonder if
there's a religious conflict

06:06.226 --> 06:07.393
in having it on a Sunday. Oh well.

06:07.427 --> 06:09.161
Jesus will just have to share.

06:09.196 --> 06:10.462
Well, he's put up with worse, so.

06:10.497 --> 06:12.364
Of course we could do Monday in a pinch.

06:12.399 --> 06:13.532
- Monday?
- Do you want coffee?

06:13.567 --> 06:15.401
- I...
- People are going to bring food.

06:15.435 --> 06:18.404
Casseroles, lasagna, ham.

06:18.438 --> 06:20.239
Someone always brings a ham.

06:20.273 --> 06:21.473
What they should really bring

06:21.508 --> 06:23.175
is some valium and a shrink.

06:23.210 --> 06:24.176
( Laughs )

06:24.211 --> 06:25.244
Gallows humor.

06:25.278 --> 06:26.278
We need flowers,

06:26.313 --> 06:27.346
tons of flowers,

06:27.380 --> 06:30.416
roses, tulips, pansies, violets.

06:30.450 --> 06:31.450
Oh!

06:31.484 --> 06:33.586
Lilies! Lilies everywhere!

06:33.620 --> 06:36.455
Is it lily season here?
Well, it's lily season somewhere.

06:36.489 --> 06:38.490
I need to make a list of guests,

06:38.525 --> 06:40.259
and we need a band.

06:40.293 --> 06:42.361
Maybe Juliana can play
something on the cello.

06:42.395 --> 06:44.263
I wonder if it's going to rain on Monday.

06:44.297 --> 06:46.298
She hates to play in the rain.

06:46.333 --> 06:48.200
Plus, rain and a memorial

06:48.235 --> 06:49.468
is such a cliched combination.

06:49.502 --> 06:51.437
- What are you doing?
- I don't know.

06:51.471 --> 06:53.339
- Tin foil!
- Aah!

06:53.373 --> 06:55.441
I need tin foil and toilet paper.

06:55.475 --> 06:57.543
Oh God. All those people,

06:57.577 --> 06:59.545
one guest bathroom.

06:59.579 --> 07:01.347
Don't think about it, Fanny.

07:01.381 --> 07:03.282
Just lie back and think of England.

07:32.512 --> 07:34.246
I blame you.

07:36.416 --> 07:37.416
Me too.

07:48.633 --> 07:53.333
Senor Dawson...
( Speaking Spanish )

07:53.834 --> 07:57.200
- Sorry.
-<i>En espanol,</i><i>senor Dawson.</i>

07:57.235 --> 07:59.867
Lo siento, senora Yockey.

08:07.835 --> 08:09.768
Excuse me, miss Yockey?

08:09.802 --> 08:10.535
Yes?

08:10.570 --> 08:12.936
<i>En espanol, senora Yockey.</i>

08:12.970 --> 08:13.936
( Sighs )
( Chuckles )

08:13.971 --> 08:15.538
( Speaks Spanish )

08:16.874 --> 08:18.675
What do you need?

08:18.709 --> 08:20.543
I don't know if you've
heard the tragic news,

08:20.577 --> 08:22.545
but the son of our beloved ballet teacher,

08:22.579 --> 08:25.481
Fanny Flowers, was in a terrible
car accident last night.

08:25.516 --> 08:27.483
I did hear. I'm so sorry.

08:27.518 --> 08:29.619
Madame Fanny's been like
a surrogate mother to us.

08:29.653 --> 08:30.720
All of us.

08:30.754 --> 08:31.854
Especially Boo.

08:31.889 --> 08:33.756
<i>I don't know if she's heard.</i>

08:33.791 --> 08:36.592
The P.A. system
in this school is so sub-par.

08:36.626 --> 08:39.761
Public schools... sad.

08:39.797 --> 08:41.764
Anyhow,

08:41.799 --> 08:44.500
I just think Boo would maybe
take it a little better

08:44.535 --> 08:46.669
if her friends broke it to her first.

08:46.704 --> 08:47.670
If it's okay.

08:47.705 --> 08:48.905
Oh, of course.

08:48.939 --> 08:49.906
I understand.

08:49.940 --> 08:52.442
Boo?

08:52.476 --> 08:53.443
Come here.

08:53.477 --> 08:54.644
<i>Bring your things.</i>

09:03.554 --> 09:05.755
- Come on, Boo.
- What's going on?

09:05.789 --> 09:07.557
Why are you doing that?

09:09.626 --> 09:10.860
- Did you hear?
- Hear what?

09:10.894 --> 09:12.729
Hubbell was in a car accident last night

09:12.763 --> 09:14.664
- and...
- And he's what?

09:14.698 --> 09:16.499
See, she doesn't get the look either.

09:16.533 --> 09:18.601
He's...

09:18.635 --> 09:19.802
Oh my God. He's dead?

09:19.837 --> 09:22.605
Oh, come on!
I just gave you that exact same look.

09:22.639 --> 09:23.606
This is terrible.

09:23.640 --> 09:24.841
I know it is. So bad.

09:24.875 --> 09:25.875
Let's go.

09:25.909 --> 09:27.443
- Where?
- Bus stop.

09:27.478 --> 09:28.444
- What?
- Shh.

09:28.479 --> 09:29.645
- Keep walking.
- We can't.

09:29.680 --> 09:31.514
"Vengeance Walking"'s at 12:00 and 2:30.

09:31.548 --> 09:33.449
- We're going to a movie?
- Everyone grieves

09:33.484 --> 09:34.684
in their own way. Head down, look sad.

09:34.718 --> 09:35.852
- Popcorn's on me.
- I don't understand.

09:35.886 --> 09:37.487
I gave her the exact same look.

09:37.521 --> 09:39.522
You have other gifts. Go.

09:41.692 --> 09:43.926
Fanny: <i>Well, I am planning</i>
<i>a memorial service.</i>

09:45.829 --> 09:47.563
<i>For tomorrow, hopefully.</i>

09:49.666 --> 09:50.800
<i>I understand that, but...</i>

09:55.739 --> 09:57.874
<i>is there any other color I can get it in?</i>

10:00.711 --> 10:02.779
Fine. Goodbye. Well, it's official.

10:02.813 --> 10:05.615
The people in the tent-rental
industry are very unpleasant.

10:05.649 --> 10:06.916
The only company

10:06.950 --> 10:09.685
that can get me a tent
to hold 100 people by Sunday

10:09.720 --> 10:12.655
said all of their tents are white canvas.

10:12.689 --> 10:13.856
<i>White</i> canvas.

10:13.891 --> 10:16.492
No one in the world wanted pink or blue?

10:16.527 --> 10:18.461
I asked them how much to dye a tent

10:18.495 --> 10:19.862
and they laughed at me. Like I'm Ellen.

10:19.897 --> 10:21.597
You have 100 people coming?

10:21.632 --> 10:23.566
More. I went over the invite list

10:23.600 --> 10:25.568
and realized I forgot to
invite the garden club.

10:25.602 --> 10:26.903
Who do you know in the garden club?

10:26.937 --> 10:29.639
I'm inviting most of the town
and they are in the town,

10:29.673 --> 10:31.874
so that brings the head count up by 20.

10:31.909 --> 10:34.510
Maybe I should forget a tent
and think about a theater.

10:34.545 --> 10:35.711
I'll put that on the possible list.

10:35.746 --> 10:37.680
Oh, here. I printed up a list

10:37.714 --> 10:40.550
of Buddhist memorial
traditions off the Internet.

10:40.584 --> 10:41.951
There are some chants you should learn.

10:41.985 --> 10:43.753
Ah. Finally a chance to use

10:43.787 --> 10:45.488
my high school Tibetan.

10:45.522 --> 10:46.722
I remember years ago

10:46.757 --> 10:49.792
when the husband of a friend of mine died.

10:49.827 --> 10:51.627
My entire wiccan group

10:51.662 --> 10:53.830
<i>went down to the ocean at midnight,</i>

10:53.864 --> 10:55.665
<i>sang a song,</i>

10:55.699 --> 10:56.933
<i>threw our clothes off,</i>

10:56.967 --> 10:58.701
joined hands

10:58.735 --> 11:01.737
and ran into the sea.

11:01.772 --> 11:04.774
It was really beautiful.

11:05.809 --> 11:07.476
There will be kids there.

11:07.511 --> 11:08.911
They can wear floaties.

11:10.514 --> 11:11.714
You were in a wiccan group?

11:11.748 --> 11:13.649
Well, I was living in Vancouver.

11:13.684 --> 11:15.551
I didn't ski, so.

11:15.586 --> 11:17.587
Traditionally, everyone should wear

11:17.621 --> 11:19.589
white robes and headbands.

11:19.623 --> 11:20.823
We'll look like a cult.

11:20.858 --> 11:22.458
Or a karate class.

11:22.492 --> 11:23.826
Maybe instead of headbands,

11:23.861 --> 11:25.595
everyone could wear a scarf?

11:25.629 --> 11:26.629
Or a cape.

11:26.663 --> 11:27.663
I love capes.

11:27.698 --> 11:28.931
Who doesn't love a cape?

11:28.966 --> 11:30.600
Where are we gonna get all those capes?

11:30.634 --> 11:31.934
We can cut up that tent.

12:50.714 --> 12:53.549
<i>( Girls chattering )</i>

13:10.734 --> 13:12.568
Sasha: <i>Boo! We're late!</i>

13:12.602 --> 13:13.602
We're not that late.

13:13.637 --> 13:15.671
20 minutes. We are 20 minutes late.

13:15.706 --> 13:16.739
Ow! Side cramp.

13:16.773 --> 13:17.740
Rock in shoe.

13:17.774 --> 13:19.475
Can't breathe. Breathing bad.

13:19.509 --> 13:20.910
Slow down, you're killing your friends.

13:20.944 --> 13:22.645
You don't want me to run to class,

13:22.679 --> 13:23.846
next time tell me the real time.

13:23.880 --> 13:26.615
- I did!
- You said it was 2:00. It was not 2:00!

13:26.650 --> 13:27.616
It looked like 2:00.

13:27.651 --> 13:28.784
Spots. Seeing spots.

13:28.819 --> 13:30.519
It had not been 2:00 for an hour!

13:30.554 --> 13:31.654
Oh, I think I'm gonna barf!

13:31.688 --> 13:32.621
No you won't!

13:32.656 --> 13:34.457
Not until we get inside.

13:35.726 --> 13:37.660
- She's not even here.
- She's not?!

13:37.694 --> 13:40.563
- I told you she wouldn't teach today.
- The day is not over yet.

13:40.597 --> 13:42.465
- <i>Oh, brother.</i>
<i>- We're going to hell.</i>

13:42.499 --> 13:44.800
- All of us.
- As long as I don't have to run there.

13:44.835 --> 13:47.503
Madame Fanny's son dies and what do we do?

13:47.537 --> 13:49.605
We watch Mark Wahlberg blow up France

13:49.639 --> 13:51.607
- for two and a half hours.
- It was a long movie.

13:51.641 --> 13:54.577
- Not my point, Melanie.
- Calm down.

13:54.611 --> 13:57.546
What about a Mark Wahlberg movie
says "sorry for your loss"?

13:57.581 --> 13:58.714
Nothing. We suck.

13:58.749 --> 14:01.384
You suck, you suck, you suck.

14:01.418 --> 14:02.551
I suck. We all suck.

14:02.586 --> 14:03.819
But tell me how you really feel?

14:03.854 --> 14:06.789
- We suck and we're going to hell.
- Wake up, Boo!

14:06.823 --> 14:08.491
We live in hell.

14:08.525 --> 14:10.593
The worst that can happen
is we go to carpinteria.

14:10.627 --> 14:12.728
I'm getting dressed over there.

14:12.763 --> 14:14.530
Do not follow me.

14:16.533 --> 14:17.666
Boo.

14:18.802 --> 14:20.636
Your dance space.

14:20.670 --> 14:21.837
My dance space.

14:30.181 --> 14:31.815
Any word from madame Fanny?

14:31.861 --> 14:33.728
Nope. Nothing.

14:33.762 --> 14:34.996
She's not gonna teach today.

14:35.030 --> 14:36.764
I wouldn't want to teach either.

14:36.799 --> 14:37.932
It's so weird, isn't it?

14:37.967 --> 14:38.967
Yesterday he was here,

14:39.001 --> 14:40.635
and today he's not.

14:40.669 --> 14:42.871
Well, I heard they
found his shoe 30 feet away.

14:42.905 --> 14:44.706
I heard they still haven't found his face.

14:44.740 --> 14:45.807
Horrible.

14:45.841 --> 14:46.875
We're horrible.

14:46.909 --> 14:48.643
Everyone in this room is horrible.

14:48.677 --> 14:50.044
I heard they had just had sex right before

14:50.079 --> 14:52.647
he went out and...

14:52.681 --> 14:54.949
- Give it up, Mel.
- Crap.

14:54.984 --> 14:57.819
I wonder if that was the first
time they'd ever had sex.

14:57.853 --> 14:59.888
I wonder if that was the first
time he'd ever had sex.

14:59.922 --> 15:02.590
- That's probably what killed him.
- What are you talking about?

15:02.625 --> 15:03.925
Okay, you're a virgin for 75 years

15:03.959 --> 15:05.894
and then the first time you have sex,

15:05.928 --> 15:07.795
you do it with a Las Vegas showgirl?

15:07.830 --> 15:08.997
He couldn't handle it.

15:09.031 --> 15:10.732
Dude drove right into a tree.

15:10.766 --> 15:12.033
If an asteroid hit this place right now,

15:12.067 --> 15:13.935
we absolutely had it coming.

15:13.969 --> 15:16.070
When my grandmother died,
her spirit haunted our car.

15:16.105 --> 15:17.705
- What?
- <i>Yep.</i>

15:17.740 --> 15:19.040
Suddenly, the day after the funeral,

15:19.074 --> 15:21.843
you couldn't start it is someone
was sitting in the passenger seat.

15:21.877 --> 15:24.646
- Grandma really liked her passenger seat.
- What did you do?

15:24.680 --> 15:27.081
- We sold the car.
- You sold your grandmother?

15:27.116 --> 15:29.984
- And bought a ski-doo.
- Lightning hit our pool three years ago.

15:30.019 --> 15:31.853
- Who died?
- No one.

15:31.887 --> 15:34.656
We're talking death, Melanie.
Stay on topic.

15:34.690 --> 15:36.758
Not enough "Hail Mary"s in the world.

15:38.027 --> 15:40.061
I feel like we're missing
something special.

15:40.095 --> 15:41.696
Something with flair.

15:41.730 --> 15:43.798
<i>( Cellphone rings )</i>

15:43.832 --> 15:44.832
Hello?

15:44.867 --> 15:46.100
Yes.

15:46.135 --> 15:48.803
I'm looking to have cocktail napkins made

15:48.837 --> 15:50.772
with the Dalai Lama's face on them.

15:50.806 --> 15:53.107
Does he ever not wear glasses?

15:54.710 --> 15:56.044
Okay, she's acting crazy, right?

15:56.078 --> 15:58.079
I don't know. Compared to what?

15:58.113 --> 15:59.781
Not you, honey.

15:59.815 --> 16:01.950
Oh. Then maybe.

16:01.984 --> 16:03.885
She's in shock. She's in pain.

16:03.919 --> 16:05.720
She hasn't talked about anything

16:05.754 --> 16:06.921
but planning this memorial

16:06.956 --> 16:08.723
since the accident happened.

16:08.757 --> 16:10.658
When I picked her up
from the police station

16:10.693 --> 16:12.694
she was wondering if
an evite was too informal.

16:12.728 --> 16:13.728
It's denial.

16:13.762 --> 16:14.963
The seven steps.

16:14.997 --> 16:16.764
Dalai Lama cocktail napkins.

16:16.799 --> 16:19.801
You go through a lot
of napkins at those things.

16:19.835 --> 16:22.070
Well, that's basically done.

16:22.104 --> 16:25.039
They just have to wire Tibet for
permission to use his likeness.

16:25.074 --> 16:26.741
<i>So where were we?</i>

16:26.775 --> 16:28.943
- Ah! Ice cream truck.
- Hey.

16:28.978 --> 16:30.712
I just went out and got some bagels

16:30.746 --> 16:31.746
if anyone's hungry.

16:31.780 --> 16:32.981
No one eats carbs anymore.

16:33.015 --> 16:34.682
Oh, okay.

16:34.717 --> 16:35.783
Well, they're stale.

16:35.818 --> 16:38.753
If that helps at all.
You know, all that chewing.

16:38.787 --> 16:40.121
Helps burn some extra calories.

16:42.725 --> 16:43.958
Is there anything I can do?

16:43.993 --> 16:44.993
Nope.

16:50.132 --> 16:51.132
<i>So...</i>

16:51.166 --> 16:53.034
she's still here.

16:53.068 --> 16:54.102
Wonder why.

16:54.136 --> 16:57.005
- It just happened, Vi.
- I know.

16:57.039 --> 16:59.607
But she really didn't know
him in the first place.

16:59.642 --> 17:00.908
There's nothing here for her now.

17:00.943 --> 17:03.678
She's awfully tall, isn't she?

17:03.712 --> 17:05.813
- Was she ever a man?
- Why would you say that?

17:05.848 --> 17:07.915
I don't know, I just think
the town could use

17:07.950 --> 17:09.617
a woman who used to be a man,

17:09.652 --> 17:10.885
to go with the republican

17:10.919 --> 17:13.621
and the Liza Minnelli impersonator.

17:13.656 --> 17:15.690
<i>( Cellphone rings )</i>

17:15.723 --> 17:16.858
Hello?

17:16.892 --> 17:19.093
Oh, it's the monk.

17:19.127 --> 17:21.061
Yes, your holiness.

17:21.096 --> 17:22.829
Thank you for calling me back.

17:27.770 --> 17:29.070
- What are you doing?
- Cleaning up.

17:29.104 --> 17:30.872
I'm cleaning up. Someone should clean up.

17:30.906 --> 17:32.006
I could clean up.

17:32.041 --> 17:34.108
Well, there's no point now.
It's almost done.

17:34.143 --> 17:36.077
- Is there anything else I can do?
- No.

17:37.913 --> 17:39.814
I didn't think anyone ate carbs anymore.

17:39.848 --> 17:41.649
Yeah, well,

17:41.684 --> 17:43.818
I'm thinking of singlehandedly
bringing them back.

17:43.852 --> 17:45.853
You know, along with smoking, lead paint,

17:45.888 --> 17:47.722
thalidomide, slip 'n slide.

17:49.124 --> 17:50.892
Picturing my face under there?

17:50.926 --> 17:52.694
( Door opens )
<i>- I don't understand.</i>

17:52.728 --> 17:54.696
No, literally I don't understand.

17:54.730 --> 17:57.065
Could you put the interpreter back on?

17:57.099 --> 17:59.033
Oh, thank God, yes.

17:59.068 --> 18:00.935
As I was trying to tell the Lama

18:00.969 --> 18:02.704
while I'm very grateful he agreed

18:02.738 --> 18:03.805
to pray for Hubbell,

18:03.839 --> 18:06.040
I was actually hoping he would do it here.

18:06.075 --> 18:08.009
At the memorial on Monday.

18:08.043 --> 18:10.778
Or Tuesday. We're flexible about the day.

18:10.813 --> 18:11.979
Could you ask him again?

18:12.014 --> 18:13.948
Because I already have a monk in Ireland

18:13.982 --> 18:15.750
who said he'd pray from there.

18:15.784 --> 18:17.685
But I was really looking for someone

18:17.720 --> 18:19.954
to represent, as the kids say.

18:19.988 --> 18:22.857
What if I throw in a trip to Disneyland?

18:22.891 --> 18:24.926
Does he have a friend
who's not busy chanting

18:24.960 --> 18:27.628
for the Japanese people?

18:27.663 --> 18:29.697
All right. Thanks anyway.

18:29.732 --> 18:31.766
What is it about these monks?

18:31.800 --> 18:33.634
How hard is it to get on a plane?

18:33.669 --> 18:34.936
Well, at least he said he'd pray for him.

18:34.970 --> 18:36.838
- That's nice.
- He can say anything he wants.

18:36.872 --> 18:39.040
He's on another continent.
How do I know he's really doing it?

18:39.074 --> 18:40.942
- Well, he is a monk.
- So?

18:40.976 --> 18:43.010
So he's a monk.

18:43.045 --> 18:45.713
Their to-do list basically consists of

18:45.748 --> 18:46.881
"pray" and...

18:46.915 --> 18:47.915
you know, "pray."

18:47.950 --> 18:50.818
I take my spirituality very seriously.

18:50.853 --> 18:52.987
If I don't see it with my own
eyes, I don't believe it.

18:53.021 --> 18:54.021
Amen.

18:55.157 --> 18:57.091
I can't believe he's gone.

18:57.126 --> 18:59.761
- Oh, Truly.
- I'm sorry.

18:59.795 --> 19:01.863
Don't be sorry.

19:01.897 --> 19:02.964
You loved him.

19:02.998 --> 19:04.966
Well, I did. I did love him.

19:05.000 --> 19:06.667
You two were magic together.

19:06.702 --> 19:08.035
Soulmates.

19:08.070 --> 19:09.670
When you would make pies...

19:09.705 --> 19:12.640
Well, he made pies. I just ate them.

19:12.674 --> 19:13.674
They were so good.

19:13.709 --> 19:15.643
Just be happy you found each other.

19:15.677 --> 19:17.979
And know that no matter what
happened between the two of you,

19:18.013 --> 19:19.781
he loved you with all his heart.

19:19.815 --> 19:21.682
Really? Right here.

19:21.717 --> 19:22.884
True love never dies.

19:22.918 --> 19:24.752
It just takes a break for a while.

19:24.787 --> 19:26.854
Okay. Anyone need some help?

19:26.889 --> 19:28.990
No? Great. Going for a walk.

19:29.024 --> 19:30.958
Truly: <i>I thought we would get married.</i>

19:30.993 --> 19:32.927
<i>I just wanted to call you mom.</i>

19:32.961 --> 19:34.762
Oh, honey.

19:34.797 --> 19:37.098
You don't need a ring to call me mom.

19:37.132 --> 19:38.800
Oh my God!

19:57.779 --> 19:58.746
Hey.

19:58.780 --> 19:59.747
Hey.

19:59.781 --> 20:00.814
You taking a walk?

20:03.585 --> 20:04.685
I guess.

20:04.719 --> 20:06.553
You want to walk my dog?

20:21.803 --> 20:23.003
<i>( Cellphone ringing )</i>

20:28.943 --> 20:30.878
( Beeps )

20:32.981 --> 20:34.782
Talia: <i>Oh, finally!</i>

20:34.816 --> 20:35.816
Hi, Talia.

20:35.850 --> 20:37.618
I can't believe you waited so long

20:37.652 --> 20:39.586
to call me. Come on, I'm dying.

20:39.621 --> 20:40.654
Tell me everything.

20:40.688 --> 20:41.922
Uh...

20:41.956 --> 20:44.958
I want to take notes
to tell the girls later.

20:44.993 --> 20:46.660
Okay. Go.

20:46.694 --> 20:49.663
( Sighs ) Well, we got here,

20:49.697 --> 20:50.964
I bought a dress,

20:50.999 --> 20:52.699
went to a party,

20:52.734 --> 20:53.767
fought with his mom,

20:53.802 --> 20:54.935
had sex,

20:54.969 --> 20:56.670
danced with his mom,

20:56.704 --> 20:58.672
he got in a car accident
and now he's dead.

21:00.875 --> 21:01.842
Talia?

21:01.876 --> 21:03.677
Hmm?

21:03.711 --> 21:05.546
- Say it.
- Nope.

21:05.580 --> 21:07.514
- Say it.
- Nope.

21:07.549 --> 21:08.482
Talia.

21:08.516 --> 21:10.918
You have the worst luck with men!

21:10.952 --> 21:12.553
Yep. There you go.

21:12.587 --> 21:13.887
I've never seen anything like it.

21:13.922 --> 21:15.889
- Let it out.
- It's like you're cursed.

21:15.924 --> 21:17.624
Or jinxed or built your house

21:17.659 --> 21:19.593
on an ancient Indian burial ground.

21:19.627 --> 21:20.761
Okay, gotta go.

21:20.795 --> 21:21.795
<i>No, wait!</i>

21:21.830 --> 21:22.830
Hanging up.

21:22.864 --> 21:23.864
( Beeps )

21:25.800 --> 21:26.767
You want a bone?

21:26.801 --> 21:27.935
<i>( Cellphone rings )</i>

21:27.969 --> 21:29.770
You have teeth?

21:29.804 --> 21:31.738
( Rings )

21:31.773 --> 21:32.806
( Sighs )

21:32.841 --> 21:34.508
Talia: <i>You danced with his mother?</i>

21:34.510 --> 21:35.542
Bye.

21:36.778 --> 21:38.712
That was Talia.
She's older than she looks,

21:38.746 --> 21:40.881
pass it on.
<i>( Rings )</i>

21:40.915 --> 21:43.417
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

21:43.451 --> 21:44.651
<i>I'm back. Do over?</i>

21:44.686 --> 21:45.652
Okay.

21:45.687 --> 21:46.820
How are you?

21:46.855 --> 21:48.856
I'm... lost.

21:48.890 --> 21:50.457
Oh, honey.

21:50.491 --> 21:51.658
No, I'm genuinely lost.

21:51.693 --> 21:52.860
I have no idea where I am.

21:52.894 --> 21:53.861
Michelle...

21:53.895 --> 21:55.629
I have nowhere to sit down.

21:55.663 --> 21:56.797
I have nowhere to sleep.

21:56.831 --> 21:58.599
I have no clothes to change into.

21:58.633 --> 22:00.500
Oh my God, I have no key to the house.

22:00.535 --> 22:01.835
I don't even know if she'll let me in

22:01.870 --> 22:03.670
when I get back. If I get back.

22:03.705 --> 22:05.739
- Michelle...
- <i>No, seriously, Talia.</i>

22:05.807 --> 22:07.441
They won't let me do anything.

22:07.475 --> 22:09.543
They won't let me clean up
or make phone calls.

22:09.577 --> 22:10.677
She's calling her mom

22:10.712 --> 22:12.579
and I'm walking an old guy's dog.

22:12.614 --> 22:14.681
And that's not a sexual euphemism.

22:14.716 --> 22:17.551
And I don't even know
when the memorial service is.

22:19.420 --> 22:22.556
( Tearfully )
And no one eats carbs anymore.

22:22.590 --> 22:24.524
( Sighs )

22:24.559 --> 22:25.759
How was the sex?

22:25.793 --> 22:27.761
Talia...

22:29.898 --> 22:31.832
It was really really good.

22:43.478 --> 22:44.544
Take a load off, Annie.

22:46.814 --> 22:49.516
- That a service dog?
- Like a marine?

22:49.550 --> 22:51.652
Like a seeing-eye dog, that kind of thing?

22:51.686 --> 22:53.487
Yeah. He is my service dog.

22:53.521 --> 22:56.590
When I get really drunk and pass out
in the gutter, he is my pillow.

22:56.624 --> 22:58.425
Okay.

22:58.459 --> 22:59.593
What'll you have?

22:59.627 --> 23:01.695
Well, what's not gross here?

23:01.729 --> 23:02.729
Oh, wow.

23:02.764 --> 23:05.699
Really tricky questions for 100, Alex.

23:05.733 --> 23:06.800
Uh...

23:06.834 --> 23:08.669
that has its moments.

23:08.703 --> 23:10.637
Okay. I'll have that and a margarita.

23:11.639 --> 23:13.607
Okay.

23:13.641 --> 23:15.575
So.

23:15.610 --> 23:18.345
- What kind of day you having?
- That kind.

23:18.379 --> 23:20.447
Thought so.

23:20.481 --> 23:22.582
You had that look in your eye.

23:22.617 --> 23:25.552
- This your place?
- For 20 years.

23:25.586 --> 23:27.654
Used to be a nice respectable surf bar,

23:27.689 --> 23:29.623
but with this freakin' economy,

23:29.657 --> 23:31.658
you wanna make ends meet,
now you gotta serve brunch!

23:31.693 --> 23:32.826
Bleh! I hate brunch.

23:32.860 --> 23:33.827
Pick a meal.

23:33.861 --> 23:35.862
Oh, a girl after my own heart.

23:37.799 --> 23:39.766
To time-specific eating habits.

23:39.801 --> 23:40.801
Here here.

23:44.539 --> 23:45.539
Nice dog.

23:45.573 --> 23:46.707
- Thanks.
- <i>What's his name?</i>

23:46.741 --> 23:48.775
<i>- Don't know.</i>
<i>- Is he dead?</i>

23:48.810 --> 23:50.577
- Don't know.
- Right on.

23:50.611 --> 23:52.579
- I'm just walking him.
- Why?

23:52.613 --> 23:55.482
Old guy asked me to.
Couldn't think of a reason to say no.

23:55.516 --> 23:57.417
- You like dogs?
- Not particularly.

23:57.452 --> 23:58.719
That could be your reason.

23:58.753 --> 24:00.354
Where were you an hour ago?

24:00.388 --> 24:02.589
- What's your name?
- Sophie Tucker.

24:02.623 --> 24:04.558
Nice to meet you, Sophie. I'm Rico.

24:04.592 --> 24:06.360
So you new in town?

24:06.394 --> 24:08.328
Yep. Just got here yesterday.

24:08.363 --> 24:11.598
Moving to a new town
on a Thursday... ballsy!

24:11.632 --> 24:13.667
Yeah. I came here with my husband.

24:13.701 --> 24:15.402
He lives here with his mother.

24:15.436 --> 24:17.437
Well, he <i>lived</i> here with his mother.

24:17.472 --> 24:18.505
Lived?

24:18.539 --> 24:20.507
Past tense?

24:20.541 --> 24:21.742
Junior college.

24:24.779 --> 24:27.514
- Wait, you're that girl.
- I'm sorry?

24:27.548 --> 24:29.750
You're the sex at the party girl.

24:29.784 --> 24:32.619
Yeah. I am that girl.

24:32.653 --> 24:33.787
Dude.

24:35.690 --> 24:36.823
Tough break.

24:36.858 --> 24:38.492
Rico!

24:38.526 --> 24:40.494
Man, that thing in the kitchen.

24:40.528 --> 24:41.561
What thing?

24:41.596 --> 24:43.530
- You know, the thing!
- The fryer?

24:43.564 --> 24:44.765
Yeah, the fryer.

24:44.799 --> 24:46.566
- The fryer.
- What about it?

24:46.601 --> 24:47.834
There's a sound.

24:47.869 --> 24:49.803
A frying sound?

24:49.837 --> 24:52.672
Man, I don't know about kitchens

24:52.707 --> 24:54.641
and the things in kitchens.

24:54.675 --> 24:56.476
Sophie Tucker, this is my wife Nina.

24:56.511 --> 24:57.477
My name's not really Soph...

24:57.512 --> 24:59.646
She's the sex at the party girl.

24:59.680 --> 25:01.481
Whoa.

25:01.516 --> 25:03.417
Dude.

25:03.451 --> 25:04.451
Tough break.

25:05.453 --> 25:06.653
<i>( Cellphone ringing )</i>

25:09.357 --> 25:11.358
- Hello?
- Thought she'd have bigger boobs.

25:11.392 --> 25:13.794
- What is that smell?
- It's the thing, man.

25:13.828 --> 25:15.462
Oh man.

25:15.496 --> 25:17.798
Oh, uh, I think you have the wrong...

25:17.832 --> 25:20.467
Oh. Well, I don't know if we've hired

25:20.501 --> 25:22.502
a sitar player for the memorial yet.

25:22.537 --> 25:24.538
You'll have to talk to Fanny about that.

25:24.572 --> 25:26.740
I don't know what's wrong
with her voicemail, so, I...

25:26.774 --> 25:28.809
No, I don't need to hear you.

25:28.843 --> 25:31.478
No, I really don't need to hear...

25:43.724 --> 25:45.759
Well, you're very good.

25:45.793 --> 25:47.794
Yes. Your mother is wrong.

25:47.829 --> 25:50.397
<i>Hey, how did you get my number?</i>

25:52.500 --> 25:54.835
Thank God I found you.

25:54.869 --> 25:57.571
I forgot to ask Fanny
something very important,

25:57.605 --> 25:59.506
and by the time I got back to her house

25:59.540 --> 26:02.442
she had started her 16 hours
of meditative silence.

26:02.477 --> 26:03.577
Is that yours?

26:03.611 --> 26:05.479
Uh, yes. I'm gonna have to call you back.

26:06.814 --> 26:09.549
Fanny asked me to do
a life-sized sculpture

26:09.584 --> 26:10.717
of Hubbell.

26:10.751 --> 26:13.553
To have on the deck at the memorial.

26:13.588 --> 26:15.522
I do found object sculptures.

26:15.556 --> 26:16.556
I'm in galleries.

26:16.591 --> 26:17.691
On deck? On deck of what?

26:17.725 --> 26:18.725
We're not sure.

26:18.759 --> 26:20.594
There's talk of the Intrepid.

26:20.628 --> 26:21.695
What?

26:21.729 --> 26:23.763
That sounds crazy to you too, right?

26:23.798 --> 26:26.399
The aircraft carrier
Intrepid from the war?

26:27.468 --> 26:29.369
She said she was getting
a great deal on it.

26:29.403 --> 26:32.372
- Something about a coupon.
- A coupon for an aircraft carrier?

26:32.406 --> 26:33.640
I don't know.

26:33.674 --> 26:36.476
She was so screwy earlier.

26:36.511 --> 26:39.446
<i>Though, I mean,</i>
<i>who could blame her, right?</i>

26:39.514 --> 26:41.548
I wish she'd talk.

26:41.582 --> 26:43.517
But you know Fanny.

26:43.551 --> 26:44.784
Not really.

26:44.819 --> 26:46.753
Anyway, Fanny asked me

26:46.787 --> 26:49.389
to do a sculpture,
which of course I'll do.

26:49.423 --> 26:51.491
But I only do nudes.

26:51.526 --> 26:53.460
So I'm gonna need some input.

26:53.494 --> 26:55.362
- What?
- Now...

26:55.396 --> 26:57.631
judging by his general build,

26:57.665 --> 26:59.432
I'm guessing

26:59.467 --> 27:01.401
he looked something like this.

27:01.435 --> 27:03.537
( Rings )
Hello?

27:03.571 --> 27:05.338
<i>It's Minka from Cozy Catering.</i>

27:05.373 --> 27:06.706
<i>I'm trying to get some confirmation</i>

27:06.741 --> 27:09.309
<i>concerning the memorial service menu.</i>

27:09.343 --> 27:10.510
What kind of confirmation?

27:10.545 --> 27:12.546
Just that the head count is now 500.

27:12.580 --> 27:14.548
- That's impossible.
- Because if it is,

27:14.582 --> 27:17.317
I don't get my new shipment
of tomatoes until Wednesday.

27:17.351 --> 27:19.719
I can't have those tarts made until
Thursday, Friday at the latest.

27:19.754 --> 27:21.454
The memorial can't be Friday.

27:21.489 --> 27:23.356
Oh, Friday would be better for me too.

27:23.391 --> 27:25.325
Gives me more time to do the detail work.

27:25.359 --> 27:26.593
I'm gonna have to call you back.

27:26.627 --> 27:28.762
- I'm sorry, I have to go.
- Wait! Wait.

27:28.796 --> 27:30.730
- What do you think?
- Aah! Jeez.

27:30.765 --> 27:33.366
Aaah.
( Grunts )

27:33.401 --> 27:34.534
( Shudders )
Am I at least

27:34.569 --> 27:36.703
in the ballpark?
( Grimaces )

27:38.406 --> 27:39.506
Hmm.

27:46.049 --> 27:48.584
This is ridiculous.

27:48.618 --> 27:49.585
Boo?

27:49.619 --> 27:50.886
- No.
- She's not coming.

27:50.921 --> 27:53.889
- No.
- Boo, she's not going to teach today, okay?

27:53.924 --> 27:56.692
If you keep us here any longer,
at least demand a ransom.

27:56.726 --> 27:58.527
If madame Fanny suddenly decides

27:58.562 --> 27:59.728
that she wants to teach today,

27:59.763 --> 28:01.797
we are going to be here for her to teach.

28:02.866 --> 28:03.966
You know you're crazy, right?

28:05.669 --> 28:07.803
- Hey.
- Nobody's leaving!

28:07.837 --> 28:08.871
Okay.

28:10.674 --> 28:11.874
I have to go to the bathroom.

28:14.644 --> 28:15.844
Never mind.

28:22.886 --> 28:25.521
Fanny?

28:25.555 --> 28:27.623
Fanny! Fanny!

28:27.657 --> 28:28.857
- What?
- Sorry to interrupt

28:28.892 --> 28:30.826
the whole suffocating-yourself
with-a-pillow thing,

28:30.860 --> 28:33.596
- but things are happening that need your
attention. - My God.

28:33.630 --> 28:35.798
- You nearly gave me a heart attack.
- I asked nicely... twice.

28:35.832 --> 28:38.867
- Nothing. - I am in
the middle of a 16-hour meditative silence,

28:38.902 --> 28:40.736
which only works if you're silent.

28:40.770 --> 28:42.605
Well, I either need to talk to you now

28:42.639 --> 28:43.939
or get more minutes on my phone plan.

28:43.974 --> 28:45.774
First of all, we hired a sitar player.

28:45.809 --> 28:47.776
He's very good. He's got the whole opening

28:47.811 --> 28:49.612
of "Dear Prudence" down cold.

28:49.646 --> 28:51.880
The caterer wants to know if
the head count is really 500,

28:51.915 --> 28:53.849
'cause if it is, there's a
problem with the tarts,

28:53.883 --> 28:55.751
which would push the
memorial back till Friday

28:55.785 --> 28:57.686
which is great for the
woman making a sculpture

28:57.721 --> 28:59.788
of my husband's genitalia
out of old hubcaps.

28:59.823 --> 29:02.791
Also, the traditional
Buddhist mariachi band

29:02.826 --> 29:05.628
you wanted is on tour in Bolivia
till fall, so what do you think?

29:05.662 --> 29:07.830
Make it a Halloween theme?
Everyone can come in costume?

29:07.864 --> 29:09.598
Everything's so jammed in here,

29:09.633 --> 29:10.699
how can you find anything?

29:10.734 --> 29:12.568
- The ham's right there.
- I see the ham.

29:12.602 --> 29:14.703
Your daughter Truly handled the
fridge so I can't help you with that.

29:14.738 --> 29:15.804
What do you want me to tell the caterer?

29:15.839 --> 29:16.939
- I'll handle it.
- What do you want me

29:16.973 --> 29:18.741
- to tell the mariachi band?
- I will handle it.

29:18.775 --> 29:20.776
Where the hell did you get a
coupon to rent the Intrepid?

29:20.810 --> 29:22.945
- Just let me handle it.
- And that would be great!

29:22.979 --> 29:24.847
Except that you're not handling it.

29:24.881 --> 29:26.982
And everyone is calling me and I
have no idea what to tell them.

29:27.017 --> 29:29.585
<i>( Phone rings )</i>
<i>( Groans )</i>

29:29.619 --> 29:31.620
( Beeps )
Yeah?

29:32.756 --> 29:34.990
She's right here. It's for you.

29:35.025 --> 29:37.026
Can I tell her what this is regarding?

29:39.929 --> 29:41.730
Ringling Brothers says you can use

29:41.765 --> 29:44.600
their tent on their down day, but
you have to go to Sacramento.

29:45.802 --> 29:47.736
Yeah, I'm sorry.
That's not gonna work for us.

29:47.771 --> 29:49.571
The voice of reason has just
reentered the building.

29:49.606 --> 29:50.906
Thank you for the call though.

29:50.940 --> 29:54.643
- What are you doing?
- I'm cutting the crazy quotient in half.

29:54.678 --> 29:56.679
You have no right to cancel my tent.

29:56.713 --> 29:58.013
500 people? Really, Fanny?

29:58.048 --> 30:00.616
Are there even 500 people in this town?

30:00.650 --> 30:02.951
- I'm calling that guy back.
- This is getting completely out of hand.

30:02.986 --> 30:05.621
We cannot wait till 2014
to have this memorial.

30:05.655 --> 30:08.023
It has to be now.
Tomorrow, like you planned originally

30:08.058 --> 30:10.859
when it was supposed to be a
traditional Buddhist ceremony,

30:10.894 --> 30:13.028
even though to my knowledge
Hubbell wasn't a Buddhist.

30:13.063 --> 30:14.763
None of this is your concern.

30:14.798 --> 30:16.632
I am going through this too, Fanny.

30:16.666 --> 30:18.834
I came here. I gave up my life.

30:18.868 --> 30:20.736
Oh, what a sacrifice that must have been.

30:20.770 --> 30:22.604
No more getting paid in poker chips?

30:22.639 --> 30:25.641
- I am his wife.
- And I am his mother!

30:25.675 --> 30:28.043
And I have been his mother for 48 years.

30:28.078 --> 30:30.646
And now I have to figure out
the proper way

30:30.680 --> 30:32.681
to say goodbye to my son.

30:32.716 --> 30:35.718
And if that includes
mariachi bands or circus tents

30:35.752 --> 30:37.953
or fireworks or the damn Rockettes,

30:37.987 --> 30:40.622
then it is for me to decide.

30:40.657 --> 30:44.693
Because my heart is
completely broken forever.

30:44.728 --> 30:46.995
And when your heart
is completely broken forever,

30:47.030 --> 30:48.864
you get to do whatever you want,

30:48.898 --> 30:50.966
no matter how crazy it seems to the woman

30:51.000 --> 30:53.068
who was his wife for 24 hours.

30:53.103 --> 30:54.803
I don't know what you want me to do.

30:54.838 --> 30:57.573
I don't want you to do anything.

30:57.607 --> 30:58.674
Ever.

31:11.588 --> 31:12.821
That's it.

31:12.856 --> 31:14.790
Hey. Hey, nobody leaves!

31:14.824 --> 31:15.991
<i>( Door opens )</i>

32:10.046 --> 32:11.780
Why aren't we doing anything?

32:11.815 --> 32:13.615
- What?
- We should do something!

32:13.650 --> 32:15.884
- Sasha, I..
- Madame Fanny is just sitting there alone

32:15.919 --> 32:17.886
and sad and you're just sitting here

32:17.921 --> 32:21.557
and we're just sitting in the studio
and no one is doing anything!

32:21.591 --> 32:22.991
All day long we've done nothing.

32:23.026 --> 32:24.993
Well, Boo lost her mind
and we went to a movie,

32:25.028 --> 32:27.029
but other than that, nothing!

32:27.063 --> 32:29.565
- Someone should do something!
- What?

32:29.599 --> 32:30.966
I don't know.

32:31.000 --> 32:32.701
Something.

32:34.604 --> 32:35.604
Okay.

32:44.714 --> 32:46.748
Where is everybody?

32:46.783 --> 32:48.050
You're kidding, right?

32:48.084 --> 32:49.051
You left.

32:49.085 --> 32:50.953
And when you left, everybody left.

32:50.987 --> 32:52.821
Well, did you try to stop them?

32:52.856 --> 32:53.889
Did I?

32:53.923 --> 32:55.724
Do you... I've been...

32:55.758 --> 32:56.792
( sighs )

32:56.826 --> 32:58.827
You're going to take 10
years off of my life.

32:58.862 --> 33:00.829
How many chairs do you guys have here?
Is this it?

33:00.864 --> 33:03.699
Oh, there's some in the boys'
dressing room, I think.

33:03.733 --> 33:05.968
- What is she doing here?
Michelle: - She's looking for chairs

33:06.002 --> 33:07.936
for people to sit on. Dog ears.

33:07.971 --> 33:10.806
Okay, we're gonna need to
scrounge up some more seating.

33:10.840 --> 33:12.808
Are there stools or I don't know,

33:12.842 --> 33:14.843
<i>short tables anywhere around here?</i>

33:14.878 --> 33:16.612
( Sniffles )

33:16.646 --> 33:17.613
What's the matter?

33:17.647 --> 33:18.847
Mark Wahlberg.

33:18.882 --> 33:20.849
- I know.
- In France.

33:20.884 --> 33:22.951
I'm behind here, what happened
to Mark Wahlberg in France?

33:22.986 --> 33:24.920
Russian mobs, lots of guns.

33:24.954 --> 33:26.889
Salma Hayek in a bra.

33:26.923 --> 33:29.825
Is that sad? Because millions
of men would disagree with you.

33:29.859 --> 33:31.693
We went to a movie.

33:31.728 --> 33:32.728
Okay.

33:32.762 --> 33:34.696
Today. We went to a movie today.

33:34.731 --> 33:35.864
We... skipped school

33:35.899 --> 33:37.032
and we went to a movie today.

33:37.336 --> 33:39.469
Boo didn't want to and we all ignored her.

33:39.494 --> 33:40.694
And we made her go.

33:40.703 --> 33:42.571
- It's okay.
- It's not okay.

33:42.605 --> 33:44.006
You don't even like Mark Wahlberg!

33:44.040 --> 33:45.941
"The Departed" wasn't bad.

33:45.975 --> 33:47.843
<i>- We're going to hell.</i>
<i>- No, we're not.</i>

33:47.877 --> 33:49.878
<i>- You said we were!</i>
<i>- I know, but I'm not like</i>

33:49.913 --> 33:51.780
the final word or anything.

33:51.814 --> 33:53.682
- Hey.
- I'm sorry.

33:53.716 --> 33:54.816
I'm sorry too.

33:54.851 --> 33:56.885
I didn't mean to scare you guys with hell.

33:56.920 --> 33:58.620
It's okay.

33:58.655 --> 33:59.721
That's what hell is for.

33:59.756 --> 34:01.657
<i>( Sobbing )</i>

34:01.691 --> 34:03.926
They were fine when I left.

34:03.960 --> 34:05.961
Okay, you guys. Look at me.

34:05.995 --> 34:08.563
I don't need apologies.

34:08.598 --> 34:10.632
God knows I cut school many a time

34:10.667 --> 34:11.934
for incredibly dubious reasons.

34:11.967 --> 34:13.735
And with me, nuns were involved,

34:13.770 --> 34:15.603
so when you talk about hell,

34:15.638 --> 34:17.873
I got a two bedroom penthouse
with a spa tub reserved there,

34:17.907 --> 34:19.507
so cocktails at 6:00!

34:19.542 --> 34:21.610
( Sobbing )

34:21.643 --> 34:23.879
There's no crying in baseball!

34:23.913 --> 34:25.847
Or ballet.

34:25.882 --> 34:26.982
Plus, if you don't stop,

34:27.016 --> 34:28.951
I'll start and I don't want to start.

34:31.788 --> 34:33.755
<i>You back?</i>

34:33.790 --> 34:36.591
You joining? You got phones?

34:37.960 --> 34:39.928
Start dialing.

34:41.797 --> 34:42.965
Okay.

34:46.426 --> 34:49.426
I'm sorry for all the trouble,
the tarts sound lovely.

34:49.452 --> 34:52.388
We're just going to postpone
the gathering for a while.

34:52.422 --> 34:55.257
I don't really have the energy right now.

34:55.292 --> 34:56.257
Thank you though.

35:06.469 --> 35:07.469
Hello, Ravi?

35:07.504 --> 35:09.405
It's Fanny Flowers.

35:09.439 --> 35:11.307
Yes, I'm sorry, but there's been

35:11.341 --> 35:12.441
a change of plans.

35:12.475 --> 35:15.277
We won't need you at the memorial.

35:15.312 --> 35:17.379
No, you are a very good sitar player.

35:17.414 --> 35:19.448
It has nothing to do with your abilities.

35:19.482 --> 35:22.251
We're just going to postpone...

35:22.285 --> 35:25.120
That's not really necessary.
I've already heard you...

35:36.466 --> 35:38.233
That was wonderful.

35:38.268 --> 35:41.203
And if we were going to have a
memorial, you would definitely...

35:43.440 --> 35:45.207
Well, have your mother call me.

35:45.241 --> 35:47.309
<i>( Knocks on door )</i>
Ravi, I have to go.

35:56.386 --> 35:58.153
Boo?

35:58.188 --> 36:00.255
What are you...

36:00.290 --> 36:02.057
Oh no. The class.

36:02.092 --> 36:03.492
Oh my God, I forgot all about the class.

36:03.526 --> 36:05.194
Yeah, we figured you did.

36:05.228 --> 36:07.162
- I'm so sorry.
- It's okay.

36:07.197 --> 36:09.264
We know you've got other things
to worry about right now.

36:09.299 --> 36:11.500
Yes, but still, it's unforgivable.

36:11.534 --> 36:13.502
Please apologize to the other kids for me?

36:13.536 --> 36:16.038
- I will.
- Are they still there?

36:16.072 --> 36:18.207
Oh no no. Everyone went home.

36:18.241 --> 36:21.343
I was gonna lock up, but the sink
in the bathroom's running again

36:21.378 --> 36:23.379
and I can't turn off the water.

36:23.413 --> 36:26.215
That sink has been a problem
ever since I put it in.

36:26.249 --> 36:27.483
Maybe if I tried a wrench?

36:27.517 --> 36:29.485
That's all right, I'll take care of it.
You go on home.

36:29.519 --> 36:30.519
But it's filling up.

36:30.553 --> 36:32.354
I'll handle it.

36:32.389 --> 36:34.256
Okay.

36:34.290 --> 36:35.290
Um...

36:36.593 --> 36:38.293
I'm sorry, madame Fanny.

36:38.328 --> 36:40.562
Me too, Boo.

36:46.569 --> 36:47.670
( Sighs )

37:41.624 --> 37:43.358
Fanny: <i>What's going on?</i>

37:43.393 --> 37:44.393
That's your seat.

38:00.343 --> 38:02.177
I don't know you that well.

38:02.212 --> 38:03.579
So I don't know what to say.

38:05.181 --> 38:07.382
Sometimes it's better not to say anything.

38:08.518 --> 38:10.185
Sometimes maybe

38:10.220 --> 38:12.221
you just need to do something.

38:14.190 --> 38:15.324
So, Fanny,

38:15.358 --> 38:17.392
it's not the Intrepid.

38:18.528 --> 38:20.229
But this is for you.

They certainly did.

I liked the song.

Tom Waits.

41:20.443 --> 41:22.244
I found it in Hubbell's CD player,

It's a very good song.

- How was it?

41:51.641 --> 41:52.607
- How'd we do?
- Who fell?

41:52.642 --> 41:54.242
- Somebody fell.
- It sounded like Edgar.

41:54.277 --> 41:55.310

41:55.345 --> 41:56.511
- We sucked.
- I sucked.

41:56.546 --> 41:58.180
- No one sucked.
- Someone sucked.

41:58.214 --> 41:59.314
- Someone always sucks.
- No one sucked.

41:59.349 --> 42:01.149
No one fell. You guys were perfect.

42:01.184 --> 42:03.218
You melted my cold
frozen tundra of a heart.

42:03.252 --> 42:05.554
- Do you think madame Fanny liked it?
- No. No, I don't.

42:05.588 --> 42:07.155
Come on.

42:07.190 --> 42:09.191
I think it was exactly was she needed.

42:10.193 --> 42:11.526
Seriously.

42:11.561 --> 42:13.528
You guys, you were truly great.

42:13.563 --> 42:16.365
- It was fun. For funeral dancing, I mean.
- That sounds creepy.

42:16.399 --> 42:18.233
Hey, let's go say hi to madame Fanny.

42:18.267 --> 42:19.501
Yeah, go take your bows.

42:24.507 --> 42:27.442
- You did good.
- Three hours of rehearsal, what do you expect?

42:29.112 --> 42:30.245
So are you leaving now?

42:30.279 --> 42:31.546
Not as long as the ham holds out.

42:31.581 --> 42:34.316
No. I mean, are you leaving?

42:34.350 --> 42:36.218
Oh.

42:37.487 --> 42:38.520
I don't know.

42:40.156 --> 42:42.190
Michelle, there's someone
I want you to meet.

42:45.194 --> 42:46.361
This is Jerry Morton.

42:46.396 --> 42:49.164
<i>Jerry and Hubbell went to school together.</i>

42:49.198 --> 42:51.400
Michelle is Hubbell's wife.

42:51.434 --> 42:54.403
- My daughter-in-law.
- It's nice to meet you, Jerry.

42:54.437 --> 42:56.304
You too. Hubbell's been driving us crazy

42:56.339 --> 42:58.407
at our poker game for a
year talking about you.

42:58.441 --> 42:59.408
Really?

42:59.442 --> 43:01.309
Yeah. He was insane about you.

43:01.344 --> 43:03.345
Told us every little detail.

43:03.379 --> 43:05.213
Shoe size nine, right?

43:05.248 --> 43:06.448
- Wow.
- Oh, yeah.

43:06.482 --> 43:08.250
When he met you, that was it.

43:09.552 --> 43:11.086
I'm so sorry.

43:11.120 --> 43:12.320
Thank you.

43:12.355 --> 43:14.256
Well, I should get going.

43:14.290 --> 43:16.224
If you need anything,
Fanny, anything at all.

43:16.259 --> 43:18.093
I'll call you first thing.

43:18.127 --> 43:19.528
And as soon as things settle down a bit,

43:19.562 --> 43:22.464
you just stop by the office and
we'll... we'll get the paperwork done.

43:22.498 --> 43:25.133
- Fanny can tell you where it is.
- Paperwork?

43:25.168 --> 43:26.501
Just some signatures, no rush.

43:26.536 --> 43:28.270
Signatures for what?
