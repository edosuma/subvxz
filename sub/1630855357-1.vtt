00:49.175 --> 00:51.469
<i>When I was 22, I got involved
with the Russian mafia.</i>

00:51.469 --> 00:52.928
<i>Here's how it happened.</i>

00:56.056 --> 00:59.059
<i>I went to school at Florida State.
I was not a very good student.</i>

00:59.894 --> 01:01.020
<i>This is how bad I was.</i>

01:01.020 --> 01:04.064
<i>I signed up for a Russian class one time,
thinking it was Spanish.</i>

01:04.064 --> 01:06.108
<i>And it took me three classes
before I realized,</i>

01:06.108 --> 01:08.486
<i>-"I don't think this is Spanish."</i>

01:08.486 --> 01:13.532
<i>So I took Russian 1, 2, 3, and 4,
never learned a fucking word.</i>

01:13.532 --> 01:14.617
MOSCOW

01:14.617 --> 01:16.786
<i>The end of Russian 4,
same teacher pulls me aside.</i>

01:16.786 --> 01:18.662
<i>She's like,
"Yo, we're taking a trip to Russia.</i>

01:18.662 --> 01:20.331
<i>If you go, you'll get a minor."</i>

01:20.331 --> 01:22.666
<i>I was like,</i>
"Strasvutsia, <i>bitches, I'm back!"</i>

01:23.751 --> 01:25.753
<i>We went to Russia.
The Russian mob ran everything.</i>

01:25.753 --> 01:27.338
<i>And they told us that our first night.</i>

01:27.338 --> 01:29.757
<i>I'm in the back of the class like,
"This trip just got fucking awesome."</i>

01:29.757 --> 01:30.841
VOLGOVITCH CASINO

01:30.841 --> 01:33.928
<i>Then, like, in exchange for our money,
they gave us two young gangsters.</i>

01:33.928 --> 01:35.971
<i>The word for that
in Russian is</i> "banditti."

01:35.971 --> 01:38.390
<i>So I ended up befriending the</i> banditti.

01:40.643 --> 01:44.396
<i>Then, one night, the whole class is taking
an overnight train trip to Moscow.</i>

01:44.396 --> 01:47.274
<i>We roll to the bar car
like a big dick in a locker room.</i>

01:47.274 --> 01:50.528
<i>Just, not that I've ever been that guy,
but I've seen it.</i>

01:50.528 --> 01:53.113
<i>So the</i> banditti <i>says to me,</i>

01:53.113 --> 01:56.158
<i>"Don't worry. When it gets dark,
we have good time."</i>

01:56.158 --> 01:58.244
<i>I'm like,
"What are we doing when it gets dark?"</i>

01:59.078 --> 02:01.163
<i>Reaches into his pocket,
pulls a ring of keys out.</i>

02:01.163 --> 02:03.499
<i>He goes,
"We're robbing the whole fucking train."</i>

02:03.499 --> 02:04.583
<i>Now...</i>

02:07.545 --> 02:09.880
<i>I'm a good per-- I'm an okay person.</i>

02:11.465 --> 02:13.676
<i>My point is, we fucking robbed them.</i>

02:15.553 --> 02:18.597
<i>We robbed the whole train,
and then we drank hard as shit.</i>

02:19.223 --> 02:22.810
<i>Pull in to Moscow at 6 a.m.,
hammered, piss drunk. Train stops.</i>

02:22.810 --> 02:23.727
It is him.

02:23.727 --> 02:25.521
<i>My whole class, they're in their pajamas.</i>

02:25.521 --> 02:27.523
<i>They're upset.
They've been robbed. I get it.</i>

02:27.523 --> 02:32.152
I want what you stole, Machine!

02:32.152 --> 02:33.946
-<i>I'm the Machine!</i>

02:33.946 --> 02:37.741
<i>They look at me and look at each other and
they're like, "Fuck it! He's the Machine!"</i>

04:27.476 --> 04:28.769
Okay.

04:28.769 --> 04:32.648
So, Bert, how we doing today?

04:32.648 --> 04:34.316
I feel fantastic.

04:35.150 --> 04:36.902
I'm eating clean. I'm working out.

04:36.902 --> 04:38.278
Blood pressure's down.

04:38.779 --> 04:40.489
No more partying.

04:40.489 --> 04:43.742
I haven't called anyone in this room
the C-word in almost three months, huh?

04:44.410 --> 04:45.995
He's never called Tat a C-word.

04:45.995 --> 04:48.205
- Oh, she's never acted like a C-word.
- Thanks, Dad.

04:48.205 --> 04:50.249
- So Mom and I act like C-words?

04:50.249 --> 04:51.458
You'd be shocked.

04:51.458 --> 04:53.293
- Wait. Just leave it there.
- Mom! Mom?

04:53.293 --> 04:54.211
- Okay. Okay.
-  Mom.

04:54.211 --> 04:55.254
- Mom.
- I'm still waiting.

04:55.254 --> 04:57.131
- All right!
- That's not fair.

04:57.631 --> 04:59.258
Bert, why are we here?

04:59.967 --> 05:02.594
Well, I wanted you guys to see
the progress that I've made.

05:02.594 --> 05:03.887
To see how far I've come.

05:03.887 --> 05:07.057
Personal growth isn't something
that you need to point out.

05:07.057 --> 05:10.102
Progress is something that your family
should be noticing on their own.

05:10.102 --> 05:12.771
Bro, that's why they're here,
to notice it.

05:12.771 --> 05:15.107
Hey, if you're not on my team,
shut the fuck up, okay?

05:15.107 --> 05:17.276
Okay, no.
Has Bert ever talked about his father?

05:17.276 --> 05:18.569
- No.
-  This has absolutely

05:18.569 --> 05:20.446
- nothing to do with my father.
- Huh.

05:21.030 --> 05:23.073
I had an incident with my daughter.

05:23.073 --> 05:24.241
An incident.

05:24.241 --> 05:27.411
That was caused by my lifestyle
and my behavior.

05:28.120 --> 05:30.247
And I am taking actions to course-correct.

05:30.247 --> 05:31.582
And you should know

05:31.582 --> 05:34.626
that he sounds just like his father
when he talks like that.

05:34.626 --> 05:35.586
-  Hold on.
- Yes.

05:35.586 --> 05:37.379
- My father doesn't understand me.
- Same.

05:37.379 --> 05:38.881
Not same. Not same.

05:38.881 --> 05:40.632
My father's always correcting me.

05:40.632 --> 05:42.259
- Same, same.
- Not same, same!

05:42.259 --> 05:44.720
Your relationship with me
is totally different

05:44.720 --> 05:46.138
than my relationship with Papa.

05:46.138 --> 05:48.682
Okay, girls, please, can you wait outside?

05:48.682 --> 05:50.809
Perfect. Come on, Tat.

05:51.810 --> 05:52.811
Deuces.

05:53.729 --> 05:54.897
- Ho, ho.

05:55.814 --> 05:57.733
- So you can see what's going on here?
-  Yeah.

05:57.733 --> 05:59.693
- You just saw that, right?
- Yes.

06:01.278 --> 06:02.696
You-- Oh...

06:03.363 --> 06:05.282
Wait. You're talking about me?

06:05.282 --> 06:06.450
Oh, yes.

06:06.450 --> 06:07.743
Oh, fuck off.

06:07.743 --> 06:09.870
Fuck off? Fuck you! Fuck off!

06:09.870 --> 06:11.538
Oh, I didn't say it like, "Fuck off!"

06:11.538 --> 06:14.083
- I said, "Fuck off."
- You do not tell me "fuck off."

06:14.083 --> 06:15.709
It's my therapy.
I can say whatever I want, right?

06:15.709 --> 06:17.961
- Actually, you can't.
- No, like, you signed an oath!

06:17.961 --> 06:22.925
Hey! I am going to allow the two of you
to talk about his issues with his father.

06:23.550 --> 06:24.468
Deuces, Bert.

06:30.057 --> 06:31.892
You know the C-word's "cunt," right?

06:31.892 --> 06:32.935
Okay. Here we go.

06:32.935 --> 06:34.311
Okay. One last push.

06:34.311 --> 06:36.605
- You can get it all in. Get it all in.

06:36.605 --> 06:38.482
We got it. It's gonna-- Getting it in!

06:38.482 --> 06:40.025
15 minutes! 15...

06:40.025 --> 06:41.819
Hey, babe! Look who's up!

06:43.779 --> 06:45.405
Babe, 96 workouts in a row,

06:45.405 --> 06:47.825
and I still feel like
I'm sweating out toxins.

06:47.825 --> 06:50.160
- Still smells like your skin is pissing.
- Two more.

06:50.160 --> 06:53.247
One more. Nice. Ho, ho!

06:54.164 --> 06:55.499
- Hey.

06:56.583 --> 06:59.044
Do you think people are gonna
think I'm on HGH? Feel that.

06:59.044 --> 07:00.546
- Uh...
- Feel my tit.

07:00.546 --> 07:02.798
No, like full-handed.
Full-handed. Grab it.

07:02.798 --> 07:04.967
There you go. Nice.

07:04.967 --> 07:06.385
I'm making smoothies.

07:06.385 --> 07:08.595
Who wants smoothies?

07:09.847 --> 07:11.557
Mom, can you please tell him

07:11.557 --> 07:14.351
not to do anything embarrassing
at my party today?

07:14.351 --> 07:18.021
Whoa! So that's how
we're gonna start our morning?

07:18.021 --> 07:20.315
I haven't done anything
publicly embarrassing

07:20.315 --> 07:22.067
in almost three months.

07:24.111 --> 07:25.112
Okay.

07:25.779 --> 07:27.197
But don't go overboard this time.

07:27.197 --> 07:29.158
I just want it to be with my friends.

07:29.158 --> 07:30.117
What friends?

07:30.117 --> 07:31.618
Don-- Eas-- Le--

07:31.618 --> 07:33.287
- So not cool.
- Don't.

07:33.912 --> 07:35.956
Are those nut sacks?

07:35.956 --> 07:37.291
No.

07:37.291 --> 07:39.459
It's a pimple for <i>Dr. Pimple Popper.</i>

07:39.459 --> 07:42.004
Oh, you don't think that's a little gross?

07:42.004 --> 07:43.755
Uh, it's totally gross.

07:43.755 --> 07:45.424
That's why Sasha and I love it.

07:45.424 --> 07:46.884
If you think about it,

07:46.884 --> 07:50.137
it's kind of like a metaphor
for her exploding into womanhood.

07:53.599 --> 07:55.309
What is wrong with this shirt?

07:58.520 --> 08:00.147
Supposed to be like this?

08:04.484 --> 08:05.485
Hey, babe.

08:06.570 --> 08:08.780
If I stand like this,
does it look tucked in?

08:09.823 --> 08:11.283
Don't wear that shirt.

08:12.492 --> 08:13.327
All right.

08:14.286 --> 08:15.913
What are these, my dad's shirts?

08:18.332 --> 08:20.334
Can you please help me pick out a shirt?

08:22.294 --> 08:23.128
Okay.

08:23.128 --> 08:26.590
I think that this therapy
is making everything worse.

08:26.590 --> 08:28.425
I think you need to get back on-stage.

08:28.425 --> 08:30.969
That's definitely not happening.

08:30.969 --> 08:32.971
- Why?
- Sit down.

08:35.057 --> 08:37.017
Have you ever seen <i>The Nutty Professor?</i>

08:37.017 --> 08:39.061
- Uh, no, I have not.
- Okay.

08:39.061 --> 08:41.021
Eddie Murphy turns into this one guy,

08:41.021 --> 08:42.314
which is great at first.

08:42.314 --> 08:44.399
But then his family starts hating him

08:44.399 --> 08:46.485
and he starts hating himself.

08:47.027 --> 08:47.861
Uh--

08:49.363 --> 08:50.364
Look.

08:54.284 --> 08:56.370
I'm the Machine on-stage.

08:56.370 --> 08:58.747
I'm also the Machine off-stage.

08:59.998 --> 09:01.375
I got high and I got drunk,

09:01.375 --> 09:03.126
and I almost got our daughter arrested.

09:03.126 --> 09:04.670
I saw the look in her face.

09:05.754 --> 09:07.506
I was helpless
and I couldn't do anything,

09:07.506 --> 09:09.466
and I wanted to kill myself.

09:11.051 --> 09:13.262
I will never let that happen
to our family again.

09:17.015 --> 09:19.893
Well, fuck,
now I wanna watch <i>The Nutty Professor.</i>

09:19.893 --> 09:22.187
It's a pretty good movie.
I wish you had watched it.

09:22.187 --> 09:24.398
It's exactly
what I'm going through right now.

09:24.398 --> 09:28.151
Maybe for now, for today,
we keep it simple.

09:30.529 --> 09:32.239
- I can do simple.
- Yeah?

09:40.122 --> 09:41.540
There she is.

09:41.540 --> 09:42.874
There's my birthday girl.

09:42.874 --> 09:45.210
Hey, Sash, what do you think of the party?

09:45.877 --> 09:46.753
It's kind of big.

09:46.753 --> 09:48.422
Kind of big and awesome, right?

09:48.422 --> 09:51.008
Hey, Bert,
does the DJ have any glitchcore?

09:51.008 --> 09:52.134
Hey, Madison...

09:55.470 --> 09:56.680
I'll go check.

09:56.680 --> 09:58.640
- Hey. Hey.
- What's up?

09:58.640 --> 10:00.600
I thought you said you invited,
like, ten people.

10:00.600 --> 10:02.227
Oh, no. I invited a ton.

10:02.227 --> 10:03.854
Well, you can't risk no-shows, babe.

10:03.854 --> 10:05.897
And partying with six people
is fucking depressing.

10:05.897 --> 10:07.816
I even invited parents that hate me.

10:07.816 --> 10:10.068
- What's up, Madison's mom?
- Oh. Hm.

10:10.777 --> 10:12.612
That guy's a bitch. He is such a...

10:12.612 --> 10:14.197
She's going through a divorce. Be nice.

10:14.197 --> 10:15.324
- Seriously?
- Mm-hm.

10:15.324 --> 10:17.075
Hey, hey. This is a sweet 16.

10:17.075 --> 10:19.328
- It's a big deal.
- Yeah, for Sash.

10:19.328 --> 10:21.621
I think Skeletor over there
must be the DJ.

10:21.621 --> 10:23.123
Can you tell him where to set up?

10:23.123 --> 10:24.583
Yeah. Hey, <i>Trainspotting.</i>

10:24.583 --> 10:27.210
You have any glitchcore?
Wait, is that my boom box?

10:27.836 --> 10:28.670
Yeah.

10:29.212 --> 10:31.923
- Is that my auxiliary cord?
- Yeah.

10:31.923 --> 10:33.717
Oh, do you want my phone?

10:34.676 --> 10:35.677
Nah.

10:39.639 --> 10:40.932
Fucking disgusting.

10:40.932 --> 10:42.559
Hey, don't do that around the kids.

10:42.559 --> 10:45.771
Actually, you know what? Stay away
from the kids. We got music! I think.

10:45.771 --> 10:47.939
Gentlemen, what are you doing up here?
Girls are in the pool.

10:47.939 --> 10:49.107
They're talking about you. Jump in.

10:49.107 --> 10:50.859
Take your shirts off.
Don't piss in my pool.

10:50.859 --> 10:53.445
- Yo, Machine.
- Not today, brother. Not today.

10:53.445 --> 10:56.531
Ladies. Steer clear of the DJ.
Food's to the right, all right?

10:56.531 --> 10:57.908
Hey, Kreischer, no booze?

10:57.908 --> 10:59.826
Hey, Madison's mom, no husband?

10:59.826 --> 11:01.870
Fucking bitch.

11:01.870 --> 11:03.997
Oh, ho-ho-ho!

11:04.539 --> 11:06.958
Killing it, B-Man. Killing it.

11:10.837 --> 11:12.130
Hey there.

11:16.843 --> 11:18.095
Dad?

11:18.095 --> 11:19.346
In the flesh.

11:24.768 --> 11:27.771
I see you haven't given up
trying to learn how to barbecue.

11:27.771 --> 11:29.022
Good for you, son.

11:29.022 --> 11:31.566
Wait, what are you doing here?

11:32.317 --> 11:35.487
Well, I'm not gonna miss
my grandkid's sweet 16.

11:35.487 --> 11:36.947
It's a big day.

11:38.657 --> 11:40.700
Right. Right.

11:42.160 --> 11:43.161
Well...

11:56.007 --> 11:57.509
Not gonna flip 'em yet, huh?

12:00.720 --> 12:03.140
Might be... Eh, it's okay, it's okay.

12:03.140 --> 12:04.516
Really?

12:04.516 --> 12:07.144
Well, I just don't want you
to mess 'em up.

12:07.811 --> 12:09.771
You know,
then people will be disappointed.

12:09.771 --> 12:11.148
You'll feel bad.

12:11.148 --> 12:13.692
It'll be all that,
"Huh, remember Bert's barbecue?

12:13.692 --> 12:15.902
- Those burgers, yikes."
- Goddamn it.

12:15.902 --> 12:17.320
Oh, see?

12:17.320 --> 12:18.780
Did you add egg to the mix?

12:18.780 --> 12:21.783
- Okay, Dad.
- It binds. It moisturizes.

12:21.783 --> 12:23.326
Makes a much better burger.

12:23.326 --> 12:25.662
- Oh.
- My dad showed up.

12:25.662 --> 12:26.955
- From Florida?
- Yeah.

12:26.955 --> 12:29.875
And it took about two seconds before
he started making me mental with the:

12:30.792 --> 12:33.795
- Look at him!
- Hey, Boo Bear! Hi!

12:34.296 --> 12:35.589
He's a monster.

12:35.589 --> 12:37.007
- Oh!
- Oh.

12:37.007 --> 12:39.092
Okay, yeah. Breathe it out there, champ.

12:39.092 --> 12:40.844
-  Hey, hey, Dad?
- Yes!

12:40.844 --> 12:43.054
Yeah, no. The dog's pooping in the pool.

12:43.054 --> 12:44.431
- What?
-  Gross!

12:44.431 --> 12:45.557
Wait, how?

12:45.557 --> 12:48.727
You paid money
to see my son take off his shirt

12:48.727 --> 12:51.271
and tell his made-up story
about robbing a train in Russia?

12:51.271 --> 12:53.482
Dad, for the millionth time,
it's a true story.

12:53.482 --> 12:54.858
It's my job, okay?

12:54.858 --> 12:56.443
And you should get back on-stage.

12:56.443 --> 12:58.737
'Cause I've seen you only,
like, five times.

12:58.737 --> 13:01.156
You paid to see him five times?

13:01.990 --> 13:04.451
I'm just shocked
that people would actually do that.

13:04.451 --> 13:05.452
Dad.

13:05.452 --> 13:07.287
You don't buy carpet five times.

13:07.287 --> 13:11.333
- Bye, Papa.
- Oh, sweetheart.

13:11.333 --> 13:12.667
I'm sorry, I'm gonna go.

13:12.667 --> 13:14.169
Oh, don't worry about that.

13:14.169 --> 13:18.798
And you remember, you can call me anytime
whenever you want to talk about...

13:18.798 --> 13:20.008
Well, you know.

13:20.884 --> 13:23.303
- All right. Bye.
-  Whoa, whoa, whoa!

13:23.303 --> 13:25.180
Wait, where are you going? Hold on.

13:25.180 --> 13:27.015
- Bye, Bert.
- Mr. Kreischer. Hey, stop!

13:27.015 --> 13:28.266
- What?
- Where are you going?

13:28.266 --> 13:30.435
Mads asked me to go to Big Bear
for, like, three days.

13:30.435 --> 13:33.230
You are not going anywhere.
Hey, you're 16 years old.

13:33.230 --> 13:36.316
You're not going to Big Bear 'cause I know
you're gonna drink beer and smoke pot.

13:36.316 --> 13:38.610
I'll be fine because I'm not you. Okay?

13:38.610 --> 13:40.779
Okay, stop. That's fair. That's fair.

13:40.779 --> 13:43.240
I deserve that. I deserve that. Okay?

13:43.240 --> 13:46.409
Hey. Look at me. Look at me. Don't go.

13:46.409 --> 13:47.953
We wrap up this party, me and you,

13:47.953 --> 13:50.080
hang out tonight,
we'll watch <i>Dr. Pimple Popper.</i>

13:50.789 --> 13:53.041
I don't even watch that show anymore, Dad.

13:53.041 --> 13:55.126
And I don't even know
half of these people here.

13:55.126 --> 13:56.461
What, are you kidding me?

13:56.962 --> 13:59.047
You know-- What about this guy?
You know this guy.

13:59.047 --> 14:00.298
- Ray Ray.
- You know Ray Ray.

14:00.298 --> 14:02.384
Dad, I said I wanted a small party,

14:02.384 --> 14:04.844
and you promised
that you wouldn't embarrass me.

14:05.512 --> 14:07.180
I'm just trying to be a good dad.

14:07.180 --> 14:08.265
See?

14:08.265 --> 14:09.975
It's about you.

14:09.975 --> 14:12.936
- It's always about you!
- What are you talking about?

14:12.936 --> 14:15.689
How did I make it about...?
How did you flip that?

14:15.689 --> 14:17.148
Don't do that! Don't leave!

14:17.148 --> 14:18.900
Don't you flip me off!

14:18.900 --> 14:20.443
Don't you get in that car!

14:20.443 --> 14:22.112
Don't get-- See?

14:22.112 --> 14:24.906
This is the C-word behavior
I was talking about in therapy!

14:24.906 --> 14:27.284
I'm not saying it!
I'm just pointing it out!

14:34.040 --> 14:36.501
It's your fat fucking fault! Asshole!

14:37.335 --> 14:38.587
Goddamn it.

14:46.845 --> 14:47.929
Son?

14:48.722 --> 14:49.723
Not now, Dad.

14:50.599 --> 14:51.474
Uh...

14:51.474 --> 14:53.059
We should...

14:54.311 --> 14:55.312
You know...

14:56.313 --> 14:58.857
if you're searching for a new path,

14:59.691 --> 15:02.736
there's always room for you
at Kreischer Karpets.

15:03.945 --> 15:06.448
I'm good, Dad, okay? I'm good. I promise.

15:06.448 --> 15:07.657
Just give me a minute.

15:08.617 --> 15:09.618
Well...

15:10.327 --> 15:14.080
I just wasn't sure, you know,
how you're making money

15:14.080 --> 15:18.168
if you're not doing
the whole comedy thing anymore.

15:19.002 --> 15:21.296
Hey, I'm a grown man.

15:21.296 --> 15:22.464
I'll figure it out, okay?

15:22.464 --> 15:24.424
Yeah, all right, all right, you know.

15:25.175 --> 15:26.301
Just trying to help.

15:26.301 --> 15:28.053
Hold on right there.

15:28.053 --> 15:30.764
No, you're not.
You're never trying to help, Dad.

15:30.764 --> 15:31.973
That's the point.

15:31.973 --> 15:35.060
When I got in trouble, what did you say
to me? "Oh, don't be an idiot."

15:35.060 --> 15:38.229
My advice to you was
don't do stupid things in public,

15:38.229 --> 15:40.273
- especially with the children.
- Oh, same thing!

15:40.273 --> 15:41.691
Which is good advice.

15:41.691 --> 15:43.610
And you and Sasha wouldn't be
where you were

15:43.610 --> 15:45.445
if you'd only listened to me.

15:45.445 --> 15:46.863
- Oh, my God.

15:46.863 --> 15:50.116
Ma'am, the party's outside. Okay?

15:50.116 --> 15:51.785
Are you the Machine?

15:51.785 --> 15:53.411
Oh, shit.

15:55.121 --> 15:57.082
Yeah, I am.
And I can do a picture in a second.

15:57.082 --> 16:00.210
I'm kind of having
a private moment with my father, okay?

16:01.878 --> 16:04.339
I'm here for the pocket watch

16:04.339 --> 16:08.176
stolen on a train in Russia 23 years ago

16:08.176 --> 16:09.886
by you.

16:11.179 --> 16:12.013
Okay.

16:12.597 --> 16:14.516
I'm having a shitshow day.

16:14.516 --> 16:17.811
So if this is some sort of TikTok prank,
I'm about to lose my fucking shit.

16:18.728 --> 16:21.940
It's definitely a prank.
Clearly, that's a fake gun.

16:22.649 --> 16:24.609
-  Or not!

16:24.609 --> 16:26.653
- She's got a fucking gun, Dad!
- Yeah, I'm clear on that now.

16:26.653 --> 16:28.196
- Sit down!
- Yes, ma'am.

16:28.196 --> 16:32.367
- My name is Irina Ivanona Volgina.

16:32.367 --> 16:35.578
And I suggest you start remembering.

16:36.162 --> 16:38.289
It was 20 years ago.
I barely remember that trip.

16:38.289 --> 16:40.709
I don't have a watch,
and it's definitely not here.

16:40.709 --> 16:43.420
Then you're coming with me
back to Russia to find it.

16:43.420 --> 16:44.921
Russia?

16:44.921 --> 16:47.006
- Look at your daughter.

16:48.842 --> 16:50.760
So innocent.

16:50.760 --> 16:52.220
So pure.

16:52.804 --> 16:54.889
So vulnerable.

16:56.141 --> 16:57.600
Do you see that man?

16:58.351 --> 16:59.686
DJ Chemo?

16:59.686 --> 17:01.646
He will follow her on her trip.

17:02.313 --> 17:04.065
If you do not find my watch,

17:04.065 --> 17:05.525
he kills her.

17:08.194 --> 17:11.448
If you try to run, he kills her.

17:13.158 --> 17:16.244
You say a word about this to anyone...

17:18.288 --> 17:19.289
he kills her.

17:19.289 --> 17:20.874
Okay. Okay.

17:20.874 --> 17:23.835
I'll do whatever you want.
Just let my daughter go.

17:25.295 --> 17:27.464
Listen, I'll do whatever you want.

17:28.381 --> 17:30.925
Just don't hurt my daughter.
And let my father go, all right?

17:30.925 --> 17:33.344
He wasn't supposed to be here.
He wasn't even invited.

17:35.013 --> 17:38.099
- I'm going with you.
- Dad, you're not going with me.

17:38.099 --> 17:41.102
I wouldn't be able to live with myself
if you failed to protect Sasha.

17:41.102 --> 17:43.897
- Dad, stop! You're not going!
- He goes!

17:44.647 --> 17:47.275
If you need persuading in Russia,

17:47.275 --> 17:48.860
he might be useful.

17:50.737 --> 17:51.905
For torture.

17:52.614 --> 17:53.740
The car is waiting.

17:53.740 --> 17:55.283
We leave now.

17:58.536 --> 18:00.205
Dad, put your fucking hands down.

18:01.414 --> 18:03.208
Excuse me. Hey, Albert?

18:04.417 --> 18:06.044
Hold, hold, hold, wait up.

18:06.044 --> 18:09.255
Oh, my God. I haven't even seen you yet.
I'm so sorry I haven't said hi.

18:09.255 --> 18:10.673
- Hello.
- Hello, dear.

18:10.673 --> 18:12.759
- There are so many people here.
-  Mm-hm.

18:12.759 --> 18:14.636
Hi. Oh, who is this?

18:14.636 --> 18:17.972
Uh... this is our, uh,
Uber driver, uh, Sylvia.

18:17.972 --> 18:19.224
Sylvia.

18:19.224 --> 18:22.727
Hi. Your Uber driver?

18:22.727 --> 18:23.728
Where are you going?

18:23.728 --> 18:25.021
- Uh...
- Um...

18:26.773 --> 18:27.899
Oh, my God.

18:28.483 --> 18:29.692
Yeah. I see what's going on.

18:29.692 --> 18:31.694
You two are gonna follow Sasha
to Big Bear.

18:31.694 --> 18:33.780
- Yes, we are.
- Exactly. Big Bear, yes.

18:33.780 --> 18:35.448
Cool. Great. Well, you know what?

18:35.448 --> 18:37.408
I'll just stay home,
take care of everything,

18:37.408 --> 18:41.955
and the two of you can just fuck off
on your creepy, little, puritanical--

18:48.169 --> 18:50.338
I love you. I'm sorry. Kiss Tats for me.

18:50.338 --> 18:51.422
Dad, let's go.

18:52.423 --> 18:53.424
Where...?

18:54.133 --> 18:55.760
Good work, Kreischers.

18:57.095 --> 19:00.431
This is my bodyguard, Sponge.

19:00.431 --> 19:02.600
Sponge, like you absorb liquids?

19:02.600 --> 19:05.478
Absorb bullets.

19:26.416 --> 19:28.418
Two? You said one.

19:29.419 --> 19:31.421
Still think I made the story up?

19:31.838 --> 19:34.340
You cannot bring both.

19:34.340 --> 19:35.758
Too many questions!

19:36.676 --> 19:38.261
Oh, fuck!

19:38.887 --> 19:41.764
Never tell me what I can do. Ever!

19:45.393 --> 19:46.436
Move it.

19:56.404 --> 20:00.450
They said Machine had ice in veins.

20:00.450 --> 20:02.785
Could walk through the walls.

20:02.785 --> 20:05.663
Drink more than any man.

20:07.123 --> 20:08.958
I grew up hearing this myth.

20:10.460 --> 20:11.544
You.

20:16.215 --> 20:17.592
You're fat.

20:18.718 --> 20:20.553
And you have tits.

20:20.553 --> 20:22.472
Very disturbing.

20:22.472 --> 20:25.475
That's body-shaming. And honestly,
I expect more empathy out of a woman.

20:25.475 --> 20:26.976
Such a disappointment.

20:26.976 --> 20:30.688
Like opening peanuts
and joke snake pop out.

20:30.688 --> 20:32.315
Enjoy your flight, Machine.

20:32.315 --> 20:34.317
It will probably be your last.

21:12.063 --> 21:15.108
All right. When we land,
I'm gonna create a diversion.

21:15.108 --> 21:17.402
What I want you to do
is go to the embassy.

21:17.402 --> 21:18.319
Dad.

21:18.319 --> 21:21.280
Now, these people really know
what they're doing around the grill.

21:21.280 --> 21:23.282
How can you eat at a time like this?

21:23.282 --> 21:27.203
Son, I'm a small-business owner
from a "stand your ground" state.

21:27.203 --> 21:28.705
This is like a Tuesday for me.

21:28.705 --> 21:31.457
Machina, the myth.

21:31.457 --> 21:34.127
Your turn, huh?

21:34.127 --> 21:36.921
No, no. I wish I could.
I just got a crown replaced.

21:36.921 --> 21:38.881
- Oh, Machina.

21:38.881 --> 21:41.300
But I have an uneven jaw,
and it took them forever to...

21:41.300 --> 21:42.969
- Hey, Bert.
- What?

21:42.969 --> 21:45.972
You want to know
why people respect Kreischer Karpets?

21:45.972 --> 21:48.182
Well, it's definitely
not 'cause you spelled "carpets" with a K.

21:48.182 --> 21:49.684
No, that's just good marketing.

21:49.684 --> 21:54.063
It's because we install anywhere.

21:54.063 --> 21:56.524
- We never show fear.

21:56.524 --> 21:58.026
We face it.

21:58.026 --> 22:02.697
So, Bert, don't show fear.

22:03.865 --> 22:04.866
Wow.

22:06.951 --> 22:08.870
You really shoehorned that message in.

22:09.537 --> 22:12.123
All right, Sponge, I guess I got next.

22:12.123 --> 22:14.375
-  Oh!

22:14.375 --> 22:15.835
Machina,

22:16.461 --> 22:19.505
all I have heard about you,
and you have titty, huh?

22:21.007 --> 22:22.759
You're such a large man.

22:24.052 --> 22:25.720
You're so fucking big.

22:26.846 --> 22:28.389
Let's hope this works.

22:29.557 --> 22:34.896
I'm gonna show you
what we in the States call "dad strength."

22:42.945 --> 22:44.030
Funny!

22:44.030 --> 22:45.239
Now...

22:46.324 --> 22:47.825
my turn, huh?

23:05.384 --> 23:08.638
Well, you showed fear.

23:12.558 --> 23:16.604
Son, I think this trip to Russia
could give you some... direction.

23:17.105 --> 23:19.774
Look, I had this with me in Rome.

23:19.774 --> 23:21.609
Saved me more than a few times.

23:22.193 --> 23:23.444
You take care of it...

23:24.695 --> 23:26.155
it will take care of you.

23:28.866 --> 23:30.910
- Your pocketknife?
- Mm-hm.

23:30.910 --> 23:32.203
Ah, thanks, Dad.

23:33.287 --> 23:36.624
We hope our sons grow up to be
the men we wish we could be, Bert.

23:37.708 --> 23:40.044
Maybe this trip
can start you on that path.

23:40.044 --> 23:41.295
And also...

23:42.922 --> 23:45.383
if you lose that knife in Russia,

23:46.134 --> 23:48.594
I will disown you.

23:48.594 --> 23:50.596
Ah, funny story.

23:52.765 --> 23:56.060
I did lose your knife in Russia.

23:56.060 --> 23:57.562
Dad, I'm sorry.

23:58.646 --> 24:00.148
I knew you'd let me down.

24:01.691 --> 24:02.608
You did?

24:06.112 --> 24:07.780
Got your manhood!

24:07.780 --> 24:09.365
Oh, you took my testicles!

24:15.121 --> 24:16.664
- Hey there.
- While you were out,

24:16.664 --> 24:19.083
- your father and I got to know each other.
- Wait.

24:19.083 --> 24:21.919
Also, we watched
<i>Butch Cassidy and Sundance Kid.</i>

24:21.919 --> 24:23.254
The ending? Wow.

24:23.254 --> 24:25.256
Dad, that's our movie.

24:25.256 --> 24:27.925
Bert, we have to find this watch.

24:27.925 --> 24:29.552
You stole it. What'd you do with it?

24:29.552 --> 24:32.597
Jesus Christ. It's the top five drunkest
I've ever been in my life.

24:32.597 --> 24:34.765
I'm usually drunk when I tell the story.

24:34.765 --> 24:38.019
- Okay. Okay. Hold on, hold on.

24:38.019 --> 24:41.480
Give me a sec. Let me think. Let me think.
God. I'm not good with guns at my head.

24:44.650 --> 24:46.527
Fedor. What about Fedor?

24:46.527 --> 24:49.530
<i>He was the gangster on the train.
Everything we stole, we gave to him.</i>

24:49.530 --> 24:51.824
Yeah, I talked to Fedor.

24:51.824 --> 24:53.576
He doesn't remember the watch.

24:53.576 --> 24:55.036
So I killed him.

24:56.162 --> 24:57.371
Jesus Christ.

24:59.165 --> 25:00.249
Igor.

25:02.460 --> 25:03.461
Which Igor?

25:03.461 --> 25:05.129
I know like 50 Igors.

25:05.129 --> 25:08.799
Uh, Igor was the mobster
that took care of our class.

25:08.799 --> 25:10.509
He lived with us in the dorms.

25:10.509 --> 25:12.303
Maybe he still lives in the dorms.

25:12.303 --> 25:14.722
Fuck school. Let's party.

25:16.015 --> 25:16.849
Hm.

25:18.309 --> 25:20.102
Then this is where we go.

25:24.857 --> 25:28.945
Can't believe you watched
<i>Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.</i> Fuck.

25:29.862 --> 25:31.656
ST. PETERSBERG

25:45.044 --> 25:47.255
Follow my lead.
If we get a chance, we run.

25:47.255 --> 25:48.631
Is there a problem?

25:48.631 --> 25:53.511
Your documents indicate
11 passengers, but I count 12.

25:54.512 --> 25:55.554
I told you so.

25:58.182 --> 26:00.851
Dad. Dad. Dad. Dad. Dad. Dad.

26:00.851 --> 26:02.353
Oh, my God. Oh!

26:03.437 --> 26:05.398
He's going down. He's going down.

26:06.607 --> 26:07.608
I count 11.

26:07.608 --> 26:08.693
Jeez Louise!

26:17.326 --> 26:18.411
Wait.

26:19.161 --> 26:20.955
That's me. I'm the Machine.

26:20.955 --> 26:22.790
Why am I on a billboard?

26:22.790 --> 26:25.042
 <i>Da.</i> You famous.

26:25.042 --> 26:27.920
I'm hot folklore in the Soviet Union.

26:27.920 --> 26:30.548
The Soviet Union is dead,
you ignorant fuck!

26:31.465 --> 26:34.051
We're Russia. We're strong.

26:34.051 --> 26:35.052
We're here.

26:37.471 --> 26:39.473
They turned it into condos.

26:41.434 --> 26:42.727
Oh, hello there.

26:43.144 --> 26:43.978
Ha!

26:44.395 --> 26:47.023
Hey, Dad, this isn't Orlando.
Quit trying to work a threesome.

26:47.023 --> 26:48.691
Put it back in your pants.

26:48.691 --> 26:50.776
Well, that was rude.

26:50.776 --> 26:52.111
Move.

26:52.111 --> 26:53.904
Hey, here's where we took classes.

26:55.031 --> 26:56.282
This is where I met Igor.

26:59.035 --> 27:01.662
Wow. Twenty-three years ago.

27:02.163 --> 27:04.206
I should've taken more pictures
of my dick.

27:04.206 --> 27:09.628
<i>♪ I don't practice Santeria
I ain't got no crystal ball ♪</i>

27:09.628 --> 27:15.343
<i>♪ Well, I had a million dollars
But I'd, I'd spend it all ♪</i>

27:15.343 --> 27:20.556
<i>♪ If I could find that jaina
And that sancho that she's found ♪</i>

27:20.556 --> 27:23.726
<i>♪ Well, I'd pop a cap in sancho
And I'd slap her down... ♪</i>

27:23.726 --> 27:25.144
THE DORMS

27:25.144 --> 27:26.937
<i>Okay, class, listen up.</i>

27:27.646 --> 27:30.483
Do not expect an easy course load.

27:30.483 --> 27:31.901
It isn't a vacation.

27:31.901 --> 27:36.072
Your goal is to culturally bond
with the indigenous citizens.

27:36.739 --> 27:40.659
This is Igor. He is a <i>banditti.</i>
You will be taking courses...

27:40.659 --> 27:43.496
I actually don't speak much Russian.
What is <i>"banditti"?</i>

27:43.496 --> 27:46.916
Oh, um, <i>"banditti"</i>
is the Russian word for mobster.

27:47.500 --> 27:50.378
This is a class trip.
How come we've never met?

27:50.378 --> 27:53.130
Oh, I don't go to class much. I'm Bert.

27:53.130 --> 27:54.882
Oh, Ashley.

27:54.882 --> 27:57.051
But Russia is a dangerous place.

27:57.051 --> 27:58.719
Igor is our fixer.

27:58.719 --> 28:01.472
He is only here for your protection.

28:02.306 --> 28:03.599
He is very dangerous.

28:03.599 --> 28:04.517
Oh!

28:07.770 --> 28:10.815
You are not to talk to
or hang out with him.

28:10.815 --> 28:13.025
All I want to do is hang out with him.

28:13.025 --> 28:16.237
<i>I never know what to believe
about what you say happened back then.</i>

28:16.237 --> 28:19.156
You do have a very active imagination.

28:19.156 --> 28:20.825
I imagine.

28:20.825 --> 28:23.953
- That's my issue.
- Well, one of them.

28:23.953 --> 28:27.081
My father and I
have a similar relationship.

28:27.081 --> 28:29.667
What the fuck is this thing?
Is it an iPad?

28:30.376 --> 28:31.794
I got this, son.

28:31.794 --> 28:33.963
I am an Eagle Scout.

28:35.214 --> 28:36.632
What is an Eagle Scout?

28:36.632 --> 28:38.342
It's like if James Bond was a Mormon.

28:38.342 --> 28:40.594
An Eagle Scout can get in anywhere.

28:40.594 --> 28:42.847
You'd know that
if you'd become an Eagle Scout.

28:42.847 --> 28:45.057
But no...

28:48.519 --> 28:50.354
My fist is Eagle Scout.

28:52.189 --> 28:53.524
I'll wait in the car.

28:55.025 --> 28:56.944
He has impulse-control issue.

28:56.944 --> 28:57.862
Very sad.

28:57.862 --> 28:59.447
Yeah. Steroids will do that to you.

28:59.447 --> 29:02.491
- They really dressed this place up.

29:03.492 --> 29:05.786
Still have the world's smallest elevator.

29:11.208 --> 29:13.752
Tell Vanya they are here.

29:16.130 --> 29:17.715
Holy shit.

29:18.382 --> 29:21.302
There was a woman that sat right there.

29:21.302 --> 29:23.971
She absolutely loved me.

29:23.971 --> 29:26.599
Igor's room was all the way down
to the right.

29:27.433 --> 29:29.518
I took a shit on a pizza box right there.

29:29.518 --> 29:31.437
Jesus, son.

29:31.437 --> 29:33.439
Eh, it got mixed reviews.

29:34.440 --> 29:37.359
Honestly,
if I hadn't sprained that finger,

29:37.359 --> 29:39.153
probably would've made it to the league.

29:39.153 --> 29:41.322
But, you know,
I wasn't about to lose a thumb war

29:41.322 --> 29:43.157
to a 12-year-old, you know?

29:43.657 --> 29:45.034
Here you go, <i>dabushka.</i>

29:45.034 --> 29:47.036
Gifts from your American friend.

29:47.036 --> 29:48.621
- Ah.

29:48.621 --> 29:51.415
Gifts are a very important aspect
of Russian life, Ash.

29:51.415 --> 29:53.501
- Bet you didn't know that.
-  Mm.

29:53.501 --> 29:55.503
Bet you didn't know your fly was down.

29:57.838 --> 29:59.965
<i>Why are you telling us this?</i>

29:59.965 --> 30:01.050
<i>Sorry.</i>

30:01.050 --> 30:02.760
<i>Lot of memories being back here.</i>

30:06.514 --> 30:09.683
Whoa, you live right across
from Igor and the <i>banditti?</i>

30:09.683 --> 30:12.061
Do you ever hear, like,
screams coming from their room?

30:12.061 --> 30:13.187
No, not really.

30:14.271 --> 30:15.272
Look at them.

30:15.814 --> 30:17.566
They're magnificent.

30:17.566 --> 30:20.110
How do I talk to them?
How do I say my name?

30:23.364 --> 30:24.740
<i>I planned the perfect sentence.</i>

30:26.992 --> 30:30.287
<i>But the second I was face-to-face
with a real Russian gangster,</i>

30:30.287 --> 30:31.497
<i>I panicked.</i>

30:32.248 --> 30:33.499
<i>Ya machina.</i>

30:39.630 --> 30:41.131
<i>Ya machina.</i>

30:41.757 --> 30:43.759
"Muchina" <i>means badass.</i>

30:43.759 --> 30:45.719
"Machina" <i>means machine.</i>

30:45.719 --> 30:47.429
<i>I said I was the Machine.</i>

30:47.429 --> 30:48.973
<i>You're an idiot.</i>

30:50.182 --> 30:51.684
<i>Ya machina.</i>

30:53.143 --> 30:55.145
-  <i>Luckily...</i>

30:55.145 --> 30:56.522
<i>they thought it was hilarious.</i>

30:56.522 --> 30:58.148
<i>On machina!</i>

30:59.567 --> 31:02.486
<i>They introduced me to their world,
and I introduced them to mine.</i>

31:02.486 --> 31:05.114
<i>Vodka, lemon, two teaspoons of sugar.</i>

31:05.114 --> 31:07.658
<i>- These are called lemon drops.</i>
- They're called lemon drops.

31:07.658 --> 31:11.996
Okay, they're from Florida,
and they're fucking delicious!

31:11.996 --> 31:14.999
The Machine is powered by lemons!

31:14.999 --> 31:18.210
<i>And the legend of the Machine was born.</i>

31:22.506 --> 31:23.882
All right, all right, all right.

31:23.882 --> 31:27.261
This next one's a little thing
I like to call Beavis and Butt-Head.

31:29.096 --> 31:30.472
His head is a butt!

31:30.472 --> 31:33.142
<i>They had no frame of reference
for American culture.</i>

31:33.142 --> 31:35.936
Do I make you horny?

31:35.936 --> 31:38.188
<i>Austin Powers? Really?</i>

31:38.188 --> 31:39.315
<i>Shut up, Dad.</i>

31:40.190 --> 31:42.943
<i>So I stole from the best,
and they thought it was me.</i>

31:44.445 --> 31:47.781
<i>To them, I was just some crazy genius
who could out-drink 'em all.</i>

31:47.781 --> 31:50.367
- I'm the Machine!

31:56.248 --> 31:58.292
I call this the "Macarena."

32:00.836 --> 32:02.129
<i>Word spread fast.</i>

32:02.129 --> 32:05.132
<i>And the legend of the Machine
just kept growing.</i>

32:09.470 --> 32:12.056
<i>Everyone in Russia heard the stories.</i>

32:12.056 --> 32:14.141
<i>You were folklore.</i>

32:14.141 --> 32:15.976
-<i>I was good for Igor's business.</i>

32:15.976 --> 32:17.436
<i>People paid him to party with me.</i>

32:17.436 --> 32:18.896
<i>Wait! The stash hole!</i>

32:19.563 --> 32:22.232
Igor's room has a stash hole in it,
in the wall.

32:22.232 --> 32:24.818
And what does he keep in this hole?

32:24.818 --> 32:26.153
Beanie Babies.

32:26.654 --> 32:28.739
Come on. Drugs, money and porn.
You're in the mob.

32:28.739 --> 32:31.533
But maybe there's something in there
that can tell us how to find him.

32:31.533 --> 32:32.951
It's this one right here.

32:32.951 --> 32:36.121
I hope so, for your daughter's sake.

32:40.417 --> 32:41.293
Oi!

32:41.293 --> 32:45.631
- That's feminism. You asked for it.
- Fuck you! Pussy woman-boy!

32:45.631 --> 32:47.841
Well, I see wokeness
hasn't made its way to Russia.

33:03.691 --> 33:06.235
- The hole?
- Yeah, right.

33:06.902 --> 33:07.903
All right.

33:08.570 --> 33:10.864
That wall used to go all the way down.

33:11.490 --> 33:12.866
If I'm not mistaken...

33:16.453 --> 33:17.454
Ah!

33:17.454 --> 33:18.414
Bingo.

33:23.669 --> 33:25.462
No watch.

33:25.462 --> 33:27.214
This is something way better.

33:27.214 --> 33:28.882
One of Ash's pot brownies, Dad.

33:28.882 --> 33:31.135
These things were gold back in the day.

33:31.135 --> 33:34.847
Why would anyone keep
20-year-old marijuana brownies?

33:34.847 --> 33:38.225
Ashley's pot brownies
are the best thing I've ever tasted.

33:38.225 --> 33:40.561
They're mad strong, though,
so only eat a little.

33:42.396 --> 33:45.357
- Don't fuck.

33:45.357 --> 33:47.234
You're fucking with me, man.

33:47.860 --> 33:49.445
Go fuck yourself.

33:51.405 --> 33:53.157
Hey, how'd you become a <i>banditti?</i>

33:54.450 --> 33:55.451
One day,

33:56.952 --> 33:58.203
man told me,

33:58.203 --> 34:01.540
"Igor, help me with this thing."

34:03.500 --> 34:04.626
Thing was mafia.

34:04.626 --> 34:06.879
'Cause if I get hungry, I get hangry,
and everybody knows

34:06.879 --> 34:09.423
marijuana goes bad after time.
It's like the reverse of pickles.

34:09.423 --> 34:12.259
So no Igor, no watch.

34:12.259 --> 34:15.220
Just old money and pickle weed.

34:15.846 --> 34:17.931
This is not good for you, Bert.

34:17.931 --> 34:20.517
-  Fuck you.

34:20.517 --> 34:21.810
Vanya.

34:21.810 --> 34:23.562
It's not good for you either.

34:23.562 --> 34:25.314
VANYA

34:25.314 --> 34:27.274
What are you doing here?

34:29.860 --> 34:31.528
He is Machina?

34:31.528 --> 34:32.654
The man's man?

34:32.654 --> 34:34.198
Nah.

34:34.198 --> 34:37.117
He has, uh... breasts.

34:43.874 --> 34:46.168
Your friend, Igor,

34:46.960 --> 34:49.546
he took over the trains to Moscow.

34:50.130 --> 34:52.508
And now I know where to find the watch.

34:52.508 --> 34:54.384
How do you know Igor runs trains?

34:54.384 --> 34:55.594
Because...

34:56.553 --> 34:57.971
I am respected.

35:01.016 --> 35:03.602
I make it my job to know these things.

35:03.602 --> 35:04.686
You?

35:07.272 --> 35:08.816
You are foolish woman.

35:09.525 --> 35:11.360
Playing pretend.

35:18.492 --> 35:19.827
I do not play.

35:24.873 --> 35:26.375
- Oh!

35:27.751 --> 35:29.753
Holy cow!

35:33.382 --> 35:35.050
You're an insolent child, Vanya.

35:35.050 --> 35:38.387
Now you come with me on train
or you go out window.

35:39.471 --> 35:42.099
- All right, let's go, Dad. Come on.
- Yeah, let's go. Let's go.

35:43.308 --> 35:44.309
See you around.

35:47.604 --> 35:48.939
Put your hands down.

35:51.733 --> 35:53.694
Well, this is wonderful.

35:53.694 --> 35:55.696
We're about to be killed by gangsters.

35:55.696 --> 35:57.823
And you're pocketing ancient pot brownies.

35:57.823 --> 36:00.826
You say shit like that and you wonder
why we haven't visited in three years.

36:00.826 --> 36:02.035
- So now it's my fault?
- Yeah.

36:02.035 --> 36:03.912
I don't want to be around that shit,
and neither do my kids.

36:03.912 --> 36:05.956
Your kids are great.
Don't bring them into this.

36:05.956 --> 36:08.834
Oh, I know they're great, Dad.
They're my kids.

36:08.834 --> 36:12.254
You know, your problem is
you live this life where you get rewarded

36:12.254 --> 36:15.299
for indulging in your worst tendencies.

36:27.686 --> 36:29.271
Let's hope that was an adjustment.

36:30.689 --> 36:32.065
Meet you downstairs.

36:54.046 --> 36:56.256
Well, we should be safe in here.

37:15.484 --> 37:16.360
I got you, son!

37:16.360 --> 37:17.819
No, I got you! I'm covering you!

37:17.819 --> 37:19.571
- Everything's under control!
- No!

37:44.805 --> 37:46.348
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

37:46.348 --> 37:47.557
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

38:03.156 --> 38:05.325
- Lift!
- No! No, no! Close, close!

38:05.325 --> 38:07.744
-  Close the door!
- Shoot back, idiots!

38:13.500 --> 38:16.628
I will present the boss
with your head, Machina!

38:16.628 --> 38:17.713
Dad.

38:17.713 --> 38:19.881
I can't use that.

38:19.881 --> 38:22.467
After I read Mandela's biography,

38:22.467 --> 38:25.929
I made a vow of nonviolence.

38:25.929 --> 38:27.472
You are dead!

38:27.472 --> 38:28.682
Dead!

38:28.682 --> 38:30.892
Fine. I'm just gonna shoot him in the leg.

38:58.128 --> 38:59.463
Let's go, dickheads!

39:06.219 --> 39:07.763
Goddamn it. Let go.

39:07.763 --> 39:09.931
No! I'm glad you're alive! Let go of me!

39:09.931 --> 39:12.142
-  Get in the car, son.
- I'm trying, Dad!

39:26.531 --> 39:27.699
Sponge!

39:28.366 --> 39:30.118
What happened to the fucking car?

39:30.702 --> 39:32.037
So bad. This is not going away.

39:32.037 --> 39:33.371
We need to get on that train!

39:34.164 --> 39:35.582
I'm gonna meet the devil.

39:35.582 --> 39:37.250
I'm going to fucking hell.

39:37.250 --> 39:38.752
- Oh, shit.
-  I'm at my lake house.

39:38.752 --> 39:40.587
- Goddamn it.
-  The fish are jumping.

39:40.587 --> 39:44.424
- I'm having mac and cheese for dinner.
- Are you doing breathing exercises?

39:44.424 --> 39:46.551
You can't do breathing exercises
for murder, Dad.

39:46.551 --> 39:47.928
I killed a man.

39:47.928 --> 39:50.806
Well, technically, you killed several men.

39:50.806 --> 39:52.432
Oh, God! You're not helping!

39:52.432 --> 39:53.892
-  Hey.
- What?

39:54.976 --> 39:56.103
It happens.

39:56.103 --> 39:58.105
I'm not gonna start smoking cigarettes.

39:58.105 --> 40:01.024
No, it doesn't happen.
A speeding ticket, that happens.

40:01.024 --> 40:03.735
Shitting your pants at Best Buy,
that happens.

40:04.528 --> 40:06.446
My brother Vanya was an asshole.

40:06.446 --> 40:08.198
Oh!

40:08.198 --> 40:10.200
Brother? Like your real brother?

40:10.200 --> 40:12.244
Like your mom and dad
are the same mom and dad?

40:12.244 --> 40:13.411
Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.

40:13.411 --> 40:15.580
- I didn't know he was your brother.
- Don't be.

40:15.580 --> 40:17.666
There is a power struggle in the mob.

40:17.666 --> 40:20.377
As oldest,
I will inherit my father's empire,

40:20.377 --> 40:22.420
but Vanya wants control.

40:22.420 --> 40:23.964
Wanted control.

40:24.840 --> 40:27.092
- He's dead.
- Oh, my God.

40:27.092 --> 40:28.802
I'm still getting used to it.

40:28.802 --> 40:32.597
What the fuck is happening?
Get me the fuck out of here.

40:32.597 --> 40:35.016
Many others also want control.

40:35.016 --> 40:36.977
They say I cannot run mob
because I'm woman.

40:36.977 --> 40:38.103
This isn't happening.

40:38.103 --> 40:39.020
Boss.

40:41.690 --> 40:42.774
Dad.

40:44.401 --> 40:46.736
Give me some life advice,
some words of wisdom.

40:48.446 --> 40:50.073
Everybody's got to die sometime.

40:50.740 --> 40:51.741
That's it?

40:52.367 --> 40:53.618
That's your advice?

40:53.618 --> 40:55.912
Well, what do you want me to say?

40:55.912 --> 40:58.498
That vulnerability is scary
and it's hard to open up?

40:58.498 --> 41:00.834
Yeah, Dad. That would've been great.

41:00.834 --> 41:02.085
Son.

41:02.085 --> 41:04.546
It was your mother
that was the coddler, not me.

41:11.011 --> 41:13.138
Jesus. We got it, Sasquatch.

41:25.400 --> 41:26.568
Igor. Igor.

41:27.986 --> 41:29.154
I'm coming. I'm coming.

41:34.034 --> 41:34.868
Hey.

41:38.747 --> 41:41.291
My brother would have shot me
if he had a chance.

41:43.460 --> 41:46.254
Thank you for making his death very fast.

41:47.964 --> 41:50.091
Well, then, can I real quick
call my daughter,

41:50.091 --> 41:51.968
just to make sure she's okay?

41:51.968 --> 41:53.011
Don't push it.

42:08.526 --> 42:11.613
Now, this is the kind
of Russian architecture I wanted to see.

42:11.613 --> 42:13.573
We're not on a sightseeing tour, Dad.

42:14.908 --> 42:17.118
Hey, Irina,
I think this is gonna be great.

42:17.118 --> 42:19.996
We'll find Igor, we'll get your watch,
and then you can let us go, right?

42:20.705 --> 42:21.998
Holy cow.

42:21.998 --> 42:24.125
This place hasn't changed a bit.

42:26.336 --> 42:28.004
Oh. Right there.

42:28.004 --> 42:30.340
That's where Igor introduced me
to the train <i>banditti.</i>

42:31.049 --> 42:33.593
I cannot go on your student trip
to Moscow.

42:33.593 --> 42:34.552
- What?
- Yeah.

42:34.552 --> 42:36.763
Different mafia runs train.

42:36.763 --> 42:38.473
Igor, what am I supposed to do here?

42:39.516 --> 42:40.934
What you always do.

42:41.476 --> 42:42.936
This is Machine!

42:43.728 --> 42:47.023
If you give Machine vodka,
you have great time.

42:48.233 --> 42:50.360
Come on, show them your character.

42:50.360 --> 42:52.279
British horny man. Come on.

42:53.863 --> 42:56.533
Do I make you horny, baby?

42:58.952 --> 43:01.913
- Do I make you randy? Yeah.
- It's classic.

43:01.913 --> 43:04.666
<i>You really like</i> Austin Powers.

43:04.666 --> 43:07.335
Yeah. It was really big in the late '90s.
Give me a break, okay?

43:07.335 --> 43:08.712
I get it.

43:09.754 --> 43:11.381
I get why they liked you.

43:11.381 --> 43:12.507
Wow, thanks, Dad.

43:12.507 --> 43:15.927
Your toxic masculinity was lighthearted
and progressive to them.

43:15.927 --> 43:18.513
Yeah, well, your compliment sounds
a little bit like a slam.

43:18.513 --> 43:21.725
- Quiet, fucked-up father-son.
-  Boss.

43:23.935 --> 43:25.729
This is the Moscow line.

43:26.646 --> 43:29.899
If Igor runs trains,
this is where he will be.

43:30.650 --> 43:32.360
Be careful.

43:32.360 --> 43:34.237
Train mob is very dangerous.

43:34.237 --> 43:36.072
Don't worry. Igor's my boy.

43:36.072 --> 43:37.657
If he's here, we're all set.

43:37.657 --> 43:40.160
Yes, but he knows you.

43:40.160 --> 43:41.536
They don't.

43:41.536 --> 43:44.581
They look like they're cosplaying
<i>American History X.</i>

43:44.581 --> 43:46.458
Let's go down further.

43:46.458 --> 43:47.834
<i>Less eyes.</i>

44:02.349 --> 44:03.350
Hello.

44:03.850 --> 44:06.102
You cannot park there.

44:11.024 --> 44:12.734
Bring me to Igor.

44:12.734 --> 44:14.361
Yes, sir.

44:17.238 --> 44:19.574
Doesn't that sound
mean the train's departing?

44:19.574 --> 44:21.826
- Get on!
- Wait, what's the plan? What are we doing?

44:21.826 --> 44:24.245
We stay on train till we find Igor.

44:24.245 --> 44:27.248
Get the plane, meet me in Moscow
with the rest of the men.

44:28.541 --> 44:31.378
I cannot believe
I'm doing this Moscow trip over again.

44:31.378 --> 44:32.837
-  Move.
-  Wow.

44:32.837 --> 44:35.632
This train smells exactly
like it did in '98.

44:36.800 --> 44:38.802
THE TRAIN

44:38.802 --> 44:41.930
It smells like cabbage and grandmas.

44:41.930 --> 44:45.600
So long, Saint Petersburg! Hello, Moscow!

44:45.600 --> 44:46.726
Oh, sorry.

44:49.979 --> 44:52.649
Why does everyone here look like
they want to punch me in the face?

44:52.649 --> 44:54.526
It's improper to smile in Russia, Bert.

44:54.526 --> 44:56.069
You save it for the people you love.

44:56.903 --> 44:57.904
Do you?

44:58.571 --> 45:00.532
- Really?
- What even is that?

45:00.532 --> 45:03.618
So you want to stay up all night
in the bar car or...?

45:03.618 --> 45:07.163
I don't know how you can drink so much
and never gain any weight.

45:07.163 --> 45:09.124
I just have really great genes.

45:11.918 --> 45:14.421
Do you maybe want to hang
in my cabin instead?

45:15.380 --> 45:16.464
<i>I did.</i>

45:16.464 --> 45:18.341
<i>I definitely did.</i>

45:20.468 --> 45:21.970
Fucking idiot. Fuck.

45:22.762 --> 45:24.973
Thanks, Dad, for the dull fucking knife.

45:25.849 --> 45:30.645
<i>♪ How could a person like me care for you?
Why do I bother...? ♪</i>

45:30.645 --> 45:32.522

45:36.568 --> 45:41.406

45:41.406 --> 45:42.323

46:03.261 --> 46:05.096
- Hey.
- Hey, what are you doing?

46:05.096 --> 46:06.890
Uh, not much.

46:06.890 --> 46:08.850
I don't know. It's pretty crazy in there.

46:09.559 --> 46:11.603
So you still want to hang out?
It's cool if not.

46:11.603 --> 46:13.897
You know, I'm a big fan
of romantic buildup.

46:13.897 --> 46:14.814
Oh, yeah?

46:14.814 --> 46:17.650
Yeah. Like, I don't even think Ross
and Rachel should be together yet.

46:17.650 --> 46:18.610
No way. Me neither.

46:18.610 --> 46:20.695
-  Right? Save it for the millennium.
-  Yeah.

46:20.695 --> 46:22.447
- I kind of think we should...
-  You.

46:24.991 --> 46:26.075
Hey.

46:27.911 --> 46:30.038
You are one they call Machine?

46:31.915 --> 46:33.625
Yeah, uh, that's me.

46:34.292 --> 46:35.251
Hm.

46:38.129 --> 46:40.215
<i>Fedor was the boss of the train</i> banditti.

46:40.215 --> 46:42.050
<i>He smelled like nicotine patches</i>

46:42.050 --> 46:44.844
<i>and looked at me
the way Ted Bundy looked at coeds.</i>

46:44.844 --> 46:46.804
<i>It was horrible.</i>

46:46.804 --> 46:50.141
Machine does not ride
with the peasants. Come, come.

46:52.852 --> 46:56.523
Uh, Ashley, I'm gonna go hang out
with these scary dudes for a little bit,

46:56.523 --> 46:58.900
and then I'll be right back, okay?
I'll check back in.

46:58.900 --> 47:01.069
FYI, I'm a good bed sharer.

47:01.069 --> 47:03.279
Okay? Fun to cuddle with,
no night farts...

47:03.279 --> 47:06.783
<i>You left that girl,
so you could hang out with a criminal?</i>

47:06.783 --> 47:09.452
<i>He's right. She was a sure thing.</i>

47:09.452 --> 47:12.830
<i>Yeah, well, I've never been good
with sure things.</i>

47:12.830 --> 47:14.874
<i>But Fedor took me to the bar car.</i>

47:14.874 --> 47:18.670
<i>This place had booze, drugs,
and here's the real gangster part.</i>

47:18.670 --> 47:21.005
This is the Machine.

47:23.091 --> 47:24.384
<i>They knew who I was.</i>

47:25.301 --> 47:27.053
They like you, huh?

47:27.971 --> 47:30.598
<i>I guarantee this is where we'll find Igor.</i>

47:32.517 --> 47:33.351
Wow.

47:33.351 --> 47:35.395
I guess nobody parties
in the bar car anymore.

47:35.395 --> 47:37.230
Hm. Especially Igor.

47:39.816 --> 47:42.235
You know, 23-year-old me loved this place.

47:42.235 --> 47:44.112
Now it looks like a truck-stop bathroom.

47:44.779 --> 47:48.408
I think your therapist would call that
"growth people notice."

47:50.243 --> 47:51.244
Wait.

47:52.370 --> 47:53.997
Did LeeAnn tell you I was in therapy?

47:56.332 --> 47:57.333
Well...

47:58.251 --> 48:00.587
when she called to invite me to the party,

48:00.587 --> 48:02.755
she opened up about
what you're going through.

48:02.755 --> 48:06.009
After Sasha's arrest,
we were both worried you'd...

48:06.509 --> 48:08.052
well, you know, mess up again.

48:08.052 --> 48:09.887
Motherfucker!

48:09.887 --> 48:11.264
Does no one trust me?

48:11.264 --> 48:13.766
Or am I the guy
that's only gonna mess up again?

48:13.766 --> 48:15.602
- You're making a scene.
- A scene?

48:15.602 --> 48:18.563
I pay my bills by making a scene!

48:18.563 --> 48:21.024
I rip my shirt off and yell,
"I'm the Machine!"

48:21.024 --> 48:22.108
Hey!

48:22.108 --> 48:25.612
- Who says, "I am Machine"?

48:27.238 --> 48:28.239
You?

48:29.157 --> 48:31.618
They say Machine can walk through walls.

48:32.493 --> 48:34.329
Only a ghost can do that.

48:35.330 --> 48:36.331
You...

48:37.123 --> 48:38.124
you are not Machine.

48:41.210 --> 48:43.713
You want to see the fucking Machine?
They want to see the Machine.

48:43.713 --> 48:46.049
- You're getting the fucking Machine.
- Hey, where you going?

48:46.049 --> 48:48.259
First up,
I don't normally do this for free.

48:48.259 --> 48:50.053
Secondly, you're dressed like dickheads.

48:50.053 --> 48:52.055
Matching Nazi dickheads.

48:52.055 --> 48:54.349
And third, you say it three times
and he shows up.

48:54.349 --> 48:55.642
It's a lot like Candyman.

48:56.225 --> 48:57.769
You've already said it twice.

48:59.270 --> 49:00.271
That's me.

49:01.064 --> 49:04.400
That's me on this bottle of vodka
that says "The Machine."

49:04.400 --> 49:05.568
What are you doing?

49:05.568 --> 49:07.111
- Dad, sit down!
- Ah!

49:08.696 --> 49:10.698
I think we need to call the boss.

49:12.909 --> 49:14.702
- Igor.
- Igor?

49:14.702 --> 49:16.954
This guy says he's the Machine.

49:17.622 --> 49:19.374
Igor, it's your boy Bert.

49:19.374 --> 49:21.918
You better have my watch, bitch.
Finish it up.

49:22.627 --> 49:25.463
He looks like the cartoon
on the vodka bottle.

49:25.838 --> 49:29.217
Only fatter. Yeah, with big titties.

49:30.134 --> 49:34.013
Someone is with him.
Volgovitch's daughter.

49:35.515 --> 49:37.600
Go to VIP car.

49:42.355 --> 49:45.817
Igor want to see you.
He will come to the bar car soon.

49:50.071 --> 49:53.991
But before that,
it would be an honor to party with you...

49:54.826 --> 49:55.827
Machine.

50:00.415 --> 50:01.708
<i>Strasvutsia,</i> bitches.

50:02.417 --> 50:03.251

50:07.255 --> 50:09.924
You do drink like Russian.

50:12.885 --> 50:15.972
- Alcohol is the universal language.
-  Yes.

50:15.972 --> 50:18.141
We're all drunk on the inside.

50:20.727 --> 50:24.397
So when do we meet the real Machine, huh?

50:25.565 --> 50:26.858

50:42.039 --> 50:44.876
I'm culturally bonding
with the indigenous citizens.

Russia!

51:03.269 --> 51:06.355
<i>Dad, you said I had to go
to Russia to find myself.</i>

51:06.355 --> 51:07.482
<i>Well, I did.</i>

51:07.482 --> 51:10.902
- I'm king of the world!

51:11.527 --> 51:13.029
<i>That's how I felt.</i>

51:13.029 --> 51:14.614
<i>I was king of the world.</i>

Titanic?

51:16.157 --> 51:17.325
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</i>

51:17.325 --> 51:19.702
I was stealing wholesale
from A-list movies,

51:19.702 --> 51:20.912
but it worked.

51:20.912 --> 51:22.538
Let me tell you something.

51:22.538 --> 51:26.459
Entertaining criminals
and sex workers was amazing.

51:26.459 --> 51:28.336
Maybe that's why I do so well
in Florida, huh?

51:29.629 --> 51:30.963
They don't even get it.

51:33.132 --> 51:35.009
Tell us more stories, Machine.

51:35.009 --> 51:37.053
The bar car was a blast.

51:37.053 --> 51:39.388
But it's also where shit got real.

51:39.388 --> 51:41.182
Uh, what do you want, Fedor?

51:42.642 --> 51:44.977
Bread. Okay, cool. Wait.

51:45.853 --> 51:47.647
- I knew you said "bread."
-  Yes.

51:47.647 --> 51:49.524
I'm picking up the language.
Give me another one, come on.

51:50.733 --> 51:51.859
Cheese.

51:51.859 --> 51:53.611
I'm basically fluent.

51:57.198 --> 51:58.825
Uh... money. Got it.

51:58.825 --> 52:00.243
Cool. Um...

52:01.369 --> 52:03.454
Oh, no, are we robbing this guy?

52:04.372 --> 52:05.540
Yeah, I don't...

52:05.540 --> 52:07.500
I don't really want to rob anyone.

52:07.500 --> 52:09.335
Yes, you do.

52:11.254 --> 52:13.381
Do it. Pussy.

52:15.049 --> 52:18.886
First him, then train.

52:18.886 --> 52:20.680
So that's what we did.

52:20.680 --> 52:22.056
- We robbed the train.
-  Yeah.

52:27.395 --> 52:29.272
<i>I was terrified.</i>

52:30.439 --> 52:32.108
<i>They were practically giddy.</i>

52:40.533 --> 52:41.617

52:42.869 --> 52:44.537
<i>Fedor kept feeding me booze.</i>

52:44.537 --> 52:48.249
Now you drink vodka.

52:49.709 --> 52:51.335
Let's go. Drink.

52:52.545 --> 52:53.546
That's it.

52:56.173 --> 52:58.718
<i>I was completely out of control.</i>

52:58.718 --> 53:01.470
<i>I mean, the rush of it.
Turned into a thrill.</i>

53:01.470 --> 53:02.597
This is my room.

53:03.347 --> 53:06.934
I was robbing the train
with the Russian mafia.

53:06.934 --> 53:08.561
And I wasn't dying.

53:08.561 --> 53:11.439
That's all my-- That's all my stuff.

53:11.439 --> 53:13.774
Wait, wait, wait.
You're actually taking my stuff?

53:14.567 --> 53:17.987
Oh, no, no, no, no.
That's my dad's, uh, knife.

53:17.987 --> 53:19.488
You can't take that.

53:19.488 --> 53:20.948
No, no, no.

53:20.948 --> 53:23.910
You can take the other stuff.
But the knife?

53:24.452 --> 53:26.037
- That's my dad's.
-  Really?

53:26.037 --> 53:27.455
No go.

53:27.455 --> 53:29.582
I can't take, huh?

53:30.583 --> 53:31.959
I'm sorry, Dad.

53:33.085 --> 53:34.253
I let him steal it.

53:34.253 --> 53:35.671
<i>It's all yours.</i>

53:40.551 --> 53:42.261
Machine.

53:42.970 --> 53:43.804
Wow.

53:44.430 --> 53:46.098
I would've cut out his heart

53:46.098 --> 53:49.060
and make him watch it stop beating
with his last breath.

53:50.603 --> 53:52.605
I guess we're just built different.

53:52.605 --> 53:53.689
The watch.

53:55.274 --> 53:56.901
<i>Once I got really drunk...</i>

53:58.903 --> 54:00.279
<i>I robbed my class.</i>

54:01.405 --> 54:02.865
<i>I robbed my whole class.</i>

54:03.699 --> 54:05.368
What the hell? Get out.

54:07.703 --> 54:10.456
Fuck that bitch. This is Russia.

54:15.252 --> 54:16.379
Ash.

54:16.379 --> 54:17.505
I'm...

54:17.505 --> 54:20.883
Whoa! Woman hit man?

54:20.883 --> 54:23.094
That is new.

54:23.094 --> 54:26.973
I felt like a complete
and total piece of shit.

54:27.890 --> 54:31.268
Give it. Fast, fast. Give me ring.

54:31.978 --> 54:34.730
Let's go.

54:36.857 --> 54:39.193
- Okay?
- That's it.

54:39.193 --> 54:40.569
- Good boy.
- Okay.

54:45.491 --> 54:46.826
I'll get it back.

54:47.326 --> 54:48.494
I promise.

54:50.162 --> 54:51.205
I'm sorry, Ash.

54:51.747 --> 54:52.665
Yeah, fuck you.

54:55.376 --> 54:57.253
Machine is the man.

54:57.253 --> 55:01.340
Hey. Machine.
Igor need us in front of train.

55:01.340 --> 55:03.342
You wait here. We come back with him.

55:03.342 --> 55:04.510
Machine!

55:05.344 --> 55:08.639
Enough of this pussy shit!

55:09.432 --> 55:11.767
Do you talk about that part with...?

55:12.810 --> 55:14.812
With Ashley when you do your show?

55:14.812 --> 55:16.230
Obviously not, Dad.

55:19.483 --> 55:21.318
<i>But I think about it sometimes.</i>

55:21.902 --> 55:24.905
I think I liked that story better
when I thought it was a lie.

55:30.578 --> 55:34.123
And then what? Story of you being
stupid idiot asshole is sad,

55:34.123 --> 55:37.543
but you need to remember my watch.

55:45.551 --> 55:47.053
Oh!

55:49.847 --> 55:51.057
I remember.

55:51.557 --> 55:53.809
There was one last private cabin.

55:58.147 --> 56:02.485
 Please don't.
It's a family heirloom.

56:02.485 --> 56:04.695
Fuck your heirloom.

56:05.446 --> 56:06.447
Do it.

56:08.991 --> 56:09.992
Sorry.

56:38.854 --> 56:40.564
That was the watch.

56:43.651 --> 56:45.444
My father was no criminal.

56:47.238 --> 56:48.697
He was a salesman.

56:50.241 --> 56:53.828
And then you stole
the only thing he ever cared about.

56:54.703 --> 56:57.248
He called police,
but no one would help him.

56:57.957 --> 57:00.376
It made him say, "Fuck honest living!

57:00.376 --> 57:03.295
If you want respect, you have to take it."

57:04.380 --> 57:07.967
And from there, he built our family.

57:12.138 --> 57:13.305
Oh, my God.

57:14.598 --> 57:16.559
I'm your origin story.

57:17.226 --> 57:19.019
Most people see themselves as Batman...

57:20.563 --> 57:22.648
not the guy who killed Batman's parents.

57:22.648 --> 57:25.276
What did you do
with the watch after that?

57:25.276 --> 57:27.403
We went back to the bar car.

57:27.403 --> 57:29.822
Fedor went through all the stuff
that we stole.

57:36.287 --> 57:38.205
- Ugh...

57:38.205 --> 57:40.833
I hate this song.

57:43.377 --> 57:45.462
Listen, in Russia,

57:46.380 --> 57:50.467
we always give gifts to a new friend.

57:51.093 --> 57:52.344
Take, Machine.

57:54.263 --> 57:55.931
He gave you the watch?

57:57.099 --> 58:00.019
- Where is it, Bert? I need to know.
-  I don't know.

58:00.019 --> 58:01.061
Machine.

58:02.396 --> 58:04.023
Igor is here.

58:06.025 --> 58:10.237
Igor, I present to you the Machine.

58:15.492 --> 58:18.204
Your friend has aged even worse than you.

58:19.413 --> 58:21.540
My men say:

58:22.166 --> 58:26.629
"Come to meet famous Machine
from a vodka bottle."

58:26.629 --> 58:28.380
I say, "Why not?

58:28.380 --> 58:29.924
You can take selfie."

58:31.258 --> 58:33.052
But you're not famous.

58:35.554 --> 58:37.264
You have tits.

58:38.307 --> 58:39.850
Yeah, we've established that.

58:39.850 --> 58:42.311
I don't know this guy. This isn't Igor.

58:42.311 --> 58:43.604
Who are you?

58:43.604 --> 58:46.440
I knew old Igor. My name is also Igor.

58:47.233 --> 58:49.985
I took train from him, make him disappear.

58:51.237 --> 58:52.404
My train now.

58:53.030 --> 58:54.615
Wait, Igor's dead?

58:55.157 --> 58:55.991
Yeah.

58:56.492 --> 58:58.827
- And you're gonna die also.
-  Enough.

59:00.329 --> 59:02.873
I'm Irina Ivanona Volgina.

59:03.582 --> 59:05.376
You know who my father is.

59:06.001 --> 59:08.921
These two dipshits belong to me.

59:08.921 --> 59:12.800
Now go, if you want to live
to see your children again.

59:14.551 --> 59:15.678
Stupid bitch.

59:16.512 --> 59:18.264
You think I didn't ask for permission?

59:18.931 --> 59:20.140
Permission?

59:27.982 --> 59:29.400
All right!

59:30.401 --> 59:31.735
Listen up.

59:32.361 --> 59:34.321
- Never show fear, right?
- Yeah.

59:34.321 --> 59:35.239
Now, look.

59:35.781 --> 59:37.491
Wait, that's the knife you gave me.

59:37.491 --> 59:39.952
No. I gave you one just like it.

59:39.952 --> 59:41.912
I knew you couldn't be trusted
with the original.

59:41.912 --> 59:43.789
- I'm not an idiot.
- Oh, my God.

59:43.789 --> 59:45.833
You heard me pining about that knife.

59:45.833 --> 59:48.794
You knew I felt guilty for losing it
for like 25 years!

59:48.794 --> 59:49.962
That's enough.

59:50.546 --> 59:52.172
Dad, stab this bald fucker.

59:52.172 --> 59:53.549
I'm sorry, son.

59:54.133 --> 59:55.467
- But...
-  I can't breathe.

59:55.467 --> 59:59.847
...I swore I would never use
a weapon for violence.

01:00:09.732 --> 01:00:10.566
Hello.

01:00:13.652 --> 01:00:14.820
Whoa!

01:00:15.654 --> 01:00:16.780
Oh, my God.

01:00:17.573 --> 01:00:18.949
She cut his throat, Dad.

01:00:18.949 --> 01:00:20.951
Oh, no, don't touch it. It's bad.

01:00:20.951 --> 01:00:22.536
Oh, why is he touching it?

01:00:22.536 --> 01:00:24.705
Oh, no. Why are you smiling?

01:00:25.622 --> 01:00:27.041
Stop. Stop right there. Stop.

01:00:27.041 --> 01:00:29.460
What am I supposed to do, Dad?
What am I supposed to do?

01:00:29.460 --> 01:00:30.544
Hit him, son.

01:00:35.132 --> 01:00:36.842
Oh, my God, Dad, I'm inside him!

01:00:36.842 --> 01:00:39.636
- Oh, my God!

01:00:40.721 --> 01:00:43.349
Let go of my arm! I'll try to get it out!

01:00:43.349 --> 01:00:45.059
He's so warm!

01:00:45.059 --> 01:00:47.603
No, no, no, no, no! God!

01:00:52.274 --> 01:00:54.401
God! Help me let go!

01:00:54.401 --> 01:00:56.236
God! You're, like, fisting his neck.

01:00:56.236 --> 01:00:57.446
Help me!

01:00:57.446 --> 01:00:59.281
Son of a bitch! God!

01:00:59.281 --> 01:01:01.909
It's like a pickle jar.
Just let go of the pickle.

01:01:01.909 --> 01:01:04.745
Damn it, Dad.
It's nothing like a pickle jar!

01:01:04.745 --> 01:01:05.829
Oh, shit!

01:01:05.829 --> 01:01:07.539
- Incoming!

01:01:07.539 --> 01:01:10.084
Pull, pull, pull, pull,
pull, pull, pull, pull!

01:01:15.714 --> 01:01:16.799
Oh, my God!

01:01:16.799 --> 01:01:18.634
Get it off! Get it off me!

01:01:18.634 --> 01:01:20.010
Get it off me!

01:01:20.010 --> 01:01:21.887
No, not that way! The other way!

01:01:25.641 --> 01:01:29.061
Hey, were you saying "pull" or "pole"?

01:01:29.061 --> 01:01:31.563
Does it really fucking matter, Dad?!

01:01:32.231 --> 01:01:34.233
Why did he say
he had permission to kill us?

01:01:36.026 --> 01:01:38.278
I know where we can find out.

01:01:42.116 --> 01:01:44.868
Uh, hello.
Can I have your attention, please?

01:01:45.452 --> 01:01:49.039
We're here looking
for whoever sent that large, bald man

01:01:49.039 --> 01:01:51.041
to kill me and my son.

01:01:51.041 --> 01:01:52.334
Dad. Hey, Dad.

01:01:53.001 --> 01:01:53.836
Dad.

01:01:53.836 --> 01:01:55.796
Maybe ease up on the Russian mafia, okay?

01:02:04.972 --> 01:02:07.182
-  Alexei.
- Hm. It is so nice to see you, sister.

01:02:07.182 --> 01:02:08.100
ALEXEI

01:02:08.100 --> 01:02:10.561
- You have another brother?
-  Mm.

01:02:10.561 --> 01:02:13.230
<i>Da.</i> Three of us. Now two.

01:02:13.230 --> 01:02:14.898
But thank you for killing him.

01:02:15.899 --> 01:02:17.734
He was pain in ass.

01:02:19.027 --> 01:02:20.487
And very stupid.

01:02:21.905 --> 01:02:23.907
You have the meanest family of all time.

01:02:23.907 --> 01:02:26.577
Kind of you to say, Machine.

01:02:27.286 --> 01:02:30.497
I can't agree with your methods
or your business model,

01:02:30.497 --> 01:02:32.833
but it warms my heart to see a son

01:02:32.833 --> 01:02:35.461
willing to take on his father's legacy.

01:02:35.461 --> 01:02:38.464
Albert, Machine's father.

01:02:40.632 --> 01:02:41.884
Oh, sister.

01:02:41.884 --> 01:02:44.761
I intend to bring our father
the watch Machine stole.

01:02:44.761 --> 01:02:46.096
It is over.

01:02:47.181 --> 01:02:48.348
Give me Machine.

01:02:48.348 --> 01:02:50.309
Machine leads me to watch.

01:02:50.309 --> 01:02:51.768
I win.

01:02:51.768 --> 01:02:53.812
All right. You win.

01:02:53.812 --> 01:02:55.189
You get the watch.

01:02:57.024 --> 01:02:58.233
It is here?

01:02:58.233 --> 01:03:00.068
Oh, yeah. It is here.

01:03:01.278 --> 01:03:02.154
In this room.

01:03:03.989 --> 01:03:06.867
We don't have it. We came to collect it.

01:03:10.037 --> 01:03:10.913
From him.

01:03:11.455 --> 01:03:12.581
Keyser Söze.

01:03:13.832 --> 01:03:15.417
Keyser Söze?

01:03:15.417 --> 01:03:18.128
Yeah, he has it. Go ahead, give it to him.

01:03:18.128 --> 01:03:20.047
Who the fuck is Keyser Soze?

01:03:20.047 --> 01:03:22.216
-  Yep, it's his now.

01:03:22.216 --> 01:03:24.843
- I'm out of the equation.

01:03:34.186 --> 01:03:35.521
Where are we going?

01:03:35.521 --> 01:03:36.939
You're gonna get us all killed!

01:03:36.939 --> 01:03:38.273
Shut up and run.

01:03:40.275 --> 01:03:41.318
There we go.

01:03:52.454 --> 01:03:53.455
Fuck!

01:03:56.208 --> 01:03:59.670
Tsk, tsk, tsk. You make me chase you.

01:04:02.589 --> 01:04:03.799
Not nice.

01:04:06.051 --> 01:04:08.011
You think you're so cool.

01:04:08.804 --> 01:04:12.057
Sister, do you really think
you'd take over family?

01:04:14.309 --> 01:04:15.310
Why?

01:04:16.770 --> 01:04:18.605
I'm strong. I'm smart.

01:04:18.605 --> 01:04:20.566
Please. You are a woman.

01:04:22.734 --> 01:04:24.319
The world is changing.

01:04:25.153 --> 01:04:26.655
Even for our family.

01:04:26.655 --> 01:04:30.492
Father and I,
we laugh about your delusions.

01:04:33.704 --> 01:04:36.999
You and Father always underestimate me.

01:04:38.709 --> 01:04:39.793
But you know what?

01:04:41.461 --> 01:04:43.714
I deserve to be treated as an equal.

01:04:44.673 --> 01:04:45.674
Agreed.

01:04:52.556 --> 01:04:53.557
Huh.

01:05:04.943 --> 01:05:06.361
-  Hey.
- Jesus.

01:05:06.361 --> 01:05:08.238
I like this feminism thing.

01:05:09.406 --> 01:05:12.743
And if you don't want me
to kill your father next,

01:05:13.285 --> 01:05:15.120
you will take me to the watch.

01:05:15.120 --> 01:05:18.165
All right. Stop, stop, stop, stop.
I'm gonna do whatever you want.

01:05:18.165 --> 01:05:20.375
Don't hurt my father, okay?
Give me a second.

01:05:20.375 --> 01:05:22.419
Dad. Dad, Dad, Dad.
Listen to me. Listen to me.

01:05:22.419 --> 01:05:23.837
We're gonna be fine.
We're gonna be a team.

01:05:23.837 --> 01:05:25.380
Dad, listen to me right now, okay?

01:05:25.380 --> 01:05:27.966
<i>Butch Cassidy and Sundance.</i>
End of the movie, Dad.

01:05:27.966 --> 01:05:30.510
- Waterfall. We're gonna waterfall.
- Enough.

01:05:32.971 --> 01:05:35.057
This is for your own good.

01:05:41.980 --> 01:05:46.068
Dad!

01:05:56.953 --> 01:06:00.040
My son is a moron.
You were wasting your time.

01:06:00.040 --> 01:06:01.667
I'll help find your watch.

01:06:02.292 --> 01:06:06.338
But only if you promise
to keep my granddaughter safe.

01:06:12.636 --> 01:06:15.472
You are a very good father.

01:06:27.401 --> 01:06:28.735
<i>A cop pulled us over.</i>

01:06:28.735 --> 01:06:30.362
<i>Dad, there's a cop.</i>

01:06:30.362 --> 01:06:33.365
<i>Officer, no,
I don't have a driver's license.</i>

01:06:33.365 --> 01:06:35.450
<i>My dad's in the backseat.</i>

01:06:35.450 --> 01:06:38.120
<i>Dad, stop. Shit, Dad.</i>

01:06:38.120 --> 01:06:39.287
<i>Dad, wake up.</i>

01:06:43.333 --> 01:06:46.128
Oh, God.

01:06:51.049 --> 01:06:52.384
Oh, shit.

01:06:53.802 --> 01:06:55.846
Ow!

01:06:55.846 --> 01:06:58.014
Son of a bitch.

01:07:07.357 --> 01:07:09.943
Hello?

01:07:09.943 --> 01:07:11.194
Fucking Dad.

01:07:12.446 --> 01:07:13.447
I'm tired.

01:07:14.656 --> 01:07:17.325
I'm sore. I'm hungry.

01:07:18.201 --> 01:07:19.202
I'm hungry.

01:07:25.959 --> 01:07:27.210
Thank you, Ash.

01:07:51.860 --> 01:07:52.944
Wait.

01:07:53.779 --> 01:07:54.613
Hey.

01:07:54.613 --> 01:07:55.947
Is my daughter okay?

01:07:56.573 --> 01:07:57.407
No.

01:07:59.951 --> 01:08:02.245
<i>My son is a moron.</i>

01:08:04.289 --> 01:08:05.916
Hey, what's up, sleepyhead?

01:08:06.458 --> 01:08:08.877
- What's this thing?
- It's a mace.

01:08:09.628 --> 01:08:10.921
The fuck are you doing here?

01:08:10.921 --> 01:08:13.173
Oh, I'm not here. You're just really high.

01:08:16.176 --> 01:08:17.636
I am really high.

01:08:22.265 --> 01:08:24.726
God, I came to Russia to become a man.

01:08:24.726 --> 01:08:26.812
All I became was an asshole criminal.

01:08:26.812 --> 01:08:29.898
Yeah. You're gonna hang on to that
for a while.

01:08:29.898 --> 01:08:32.108
A lot of it,
all the shit that happened on the train.

01:08:32.734 --> 01:08:35.779
But, hey, that shirtless idiot thing?

01:08:36.238 --> 01:08:38.240
It pays off bigtime.

01:08:38.240 --> 01:08:39.407
- Really?
- Oh, yeah.

01:08:39.407 --> 01:08:41.117
- Yeah?
- Oh, dude.

01:08:41.117 --> 01:08:44.246
This trip to Russia sets you on a path.

01:08:44.830 --> 01:08:46.957
You, my friend,
are great at making people laugh.

01:08:46.957 --> 01:08:48.083
Thanks, man.

01:08:48.083 --> 01:08:49.167
Yeah.

01:08:49.668 --> 01:08:51.586
- I am gonna be okay.
- Yeah.

01:08:52.254 --> 01:08:54.005
And then your wife's
gonna put you in therapy.

01:08:54.005 --> 01:08:55.090
Whoa.

01:08:55.090 --> 01:08:56.883
- We're married?
- Oh, yeah.

01:08:56.883 --> 01:08:58.260
Is she hot?

01:08:58.260 --> 01:08:59.970
- I mean, yeah.
- Wait, what do you mean?

01:08:59.970 --> 01:09:03.223
I mean, I think she's hot.
I think she's hot. I mean, she's 50.

01:09:05.642 --> 01:09:07.686
You married a 50-year-old?

01:09:08.270 --> 01:09:10.897
Dude, what the fuck?
I thought you said we were gonna be okay.

01:09:10.897 --> 01:09:12.399
No, I forgot how dumb I am.

01:09:12.399 --> 01:09:13.817
We married her when she was 30.

01:09:13.817 --> 01:09:16.611
She was-- She still is a smoke show.
She's hot as shit, okay?

01:09:16.611 --> 01:09:18.572
- Okay.
- Don't make me defend our wife.

01:09:19.489 --> 01:09:20.574
She's a great mom.

01:09:20.574 --> 01:09:21.700
Whoa.

01:09:21.700 --> 01:09:22.617
We got kids?

01:09:22.617 --> 01:09:23.702
- Yeah.
- Boys?

01:09:23.702 --> 01:09:25.370
- Mm...
- Ah, I knew we'd have boys.

01:09:25.370 --> 01:09:26.788
I always wanted to have boys.

01:09:26.788 --> 01:09:28.206
Look at us.

01:09:28.206 --> 01:09:31.877
Both of us just figuring ourselves out.

01:09:32.752 --> 01:09:33.628
Ah.

01:09:33.628 --> 01:09:35.171
Well, I am.

01:09:35.797 --> 01:09:37.340
You're still pretty lost.

01:09:37.340 --> 01:09:40.051
I mean, you're literally lost in a forest.

01:09:40.051 --> 01:09:41.469
High on a pot brownie.

01:09:41.469 --> 01:09:44.014
'Cause your dad kicked you off a train.

01:09:44.014 --> 01:09:45.348
Because he hates you.

01:09:45.348 --> 01:09:48.560
Because you can't save your own daughter,
who hates you.

01:09:48.560 --> 01:09:51.646
Now your wife's gonna hate you.
Your whole family pretty much hates you.

01:09:51.646 --> 01:09:52.981
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.

01:09:52.981 --> 01:09:55.400
I know this. I know this.
Why are you doing this to me?

01:09:55.400 --> 01:09:58.069
'Cause I'm trying to save you.
You're about to get shot.

01:09:59.613 --> 01:10:00.447
How so?

01:10:00.447 --> 01:10:03.950
You're about to get shot.

01:10:03.950 --> 01:10:06.036
Meaning what?

01:10:06.036 --> 01:10:07.787
You're under fire.

01:10:21.384 --> 01:10:22.844
Fuck! God!

01:10:23.678 --> 01:10:24.846
Oh, my God!

01:10:26.264 --> 01:10:27.265
Fuck.

01:10:46.618 --> 01:10:47.702
Bert?

01:10:48.536 --> 01:10:49.537
Igor?

01:10:53.708 --> 01:10:55.752
- Bert.
- Igor!

01:10:56.670 --> 01:10:58.588
- Machina!
- Igor!

01:10:58.588 --> 01:11:01.508
You look like a big bear. I mean, what?

01:11:01.508 --> 01:11:02.968
- Oh!

01:11:02.968 --> 01:11:05.804
- God.
- My friend, you are here.

01:11:05.804 --> 01:11:09.432
I can't believe you're alive.
Oh, shit. It's good to see you.

01:11:13.812 --> 01:11:15.188
Do you have any snacks?

01:11:18.733 --> 01:11:20.819
This is my home.

01:11:20.819 --> 01:11:21.987
For years now.

01:11:21.987 --> 01:11:24.948
- Nice. It's kind of like West Virginia.
- Yeah. West Vagina.

01:11:24.948 --> 01:11:27.993
Igor! Deuces.

01:11:27.993 --> 01:11:29.619
That's uncircumcised.

01:11:32.163 --> 01:11:33.832
- You almost hit that guy, Igor.
- Yeah.

01:11:35.417 --> 01:11:36.751
It's a tradition here.

01:11:37.377 --> 01:11:38.670
Ah, look at this.

01:11:39.295 --> 01:11:40.338
This is it.

01:11:40.338 --> 01:11:41.256
IGOR'S VILLAGE

01:11:41.256 --> 01:11:42.590
-  This is your house?
-  Yeah.

01:11:48.138 --> 01:11:49.681
Holy shit.

01:11:49.681 --> 01:11:52.767
Oh! Wait, are these all your kids?

01:11:52.767 --> 01:11:55.520
Yeah, this is most of my kids.

01:11:55.520 --> 01:11:58.815
- Oh, my God.

01:11:59.524 --> 01:12:01.234
Jesus, you know you can pull out, right?

01:12:01.234 --> 01:12:04.320
Yes, but my dick
is little bit longer, so I'm like:

01:12:04.320 --> 01:12:06.573
- Oh, like a magician.
- Magician!

01:12:06.573 --> 01:12:08.408
- With the scarves!
- Yeah.

01:12:08.408 --> 01:12:09.868
- Hey.
- I missed you.

01:12:14.706 --> 01:12:15.665
...Machina!

01:12:15.665 --> 01:12:17.625
Hey! Yeah!

01:12:17.625 --> 01:12:19.210
- Oh, Machina!
- Yeah!

01:12:25.675 --> 01:12:26.509
Huh?

01:12:28.094 --> 01:12:28.928
Igor.

01:12:28.928 --> 01:12:30.472
Igor, Igor.

01:12:33.767 --> 01:12:36.895
My wife, she's a big fan of you, Machine.

01:12:36.895 --> 01:12:38.438
- Oh!
- Many in village are.

01:12:38.438 --> 01:12:40.190
They listen to your podcast.

01:12:40.190 --> 01:12:42.108
Why no new episodes?

01:12:42.108 --> 01:12:44.027
Igor, have you killed the bear?

01:12:44.027 --> 01:12:49.532
Not yet, but this is better!
I find friend, Machine. Real one!

01:12:50.617 --> 01:12:53.787
Blessed day for our village!

01:12:53.787 --> 01:12:59.042
First you find Machine,
Then I find whore!

01:12:59.042 --> 01:13:00.919
-  She find whore.
- What?

01:13:10.261 --> 01:13:13.139
- Holy shit! Irina! You're alive!

01:13:13.139 --> 01:13:15.308
How the fuck are you still alive?

01:13:15.308 --> 01:13:17.727
Goddamn it. Oh, my God!

01:13:18.269 --> 01:13:20.355
Would you like to buy her for the fucking?

01:13:20.355 --> 01:13:21.856
I don't know.

01:13:21.856 --> 01:13:23.942
What do you think? How much?

01:13:23.942 --> 01:13:25.693
More than you have.

01:13:26.402 --> 01:13:27.695
I don't know, maybe--

01:13:27.695 --> 01:13:29.906
Oh, my God! What happened to your leg?

01:13:29.906 --> 01:13:31.199
Oh, that looks bad.

01:13:31.199 --> 01:13:33.076
Here, tell me if you feel this.

01:13:33.076 --> 01:13:34.494
- Oh!

01:13:34.494 --> 01:13:36.704
Igor! Help! I know this whore!

01:13:36.704 --> 01:13:38.081
Let's get her in your house!

01:13:38.081 --> 01:13:40.750
- Here.
- Igor, do you have any hydrogen peroxide?

01:13:40.750 --> 01:13:44.129
Uh... no,
but we have many kind of animal spit.

01:13:44.129 --> 01:13:45.797
- Okay, well, here you go.
- Fuck!

01:13:45.797 --> 01:13:47.799
Okay, you're fine. No, no, no. We're good.

01:13:47.799 --> 01:13:50.176
- Fuck!
- Just get me something to dress it with.

01:13:50.176 --> 01:13:53.429
- I gotta get this boot off.

01:13:53.429 --> 01:13:56.057
- Okay. Okay, here we go.
- Okay. Wait, wait, be careful.

01:13:57.892 --> 01:13:59.435
-  All right.

01:14:00.061 --> 01:14:02.605
Oh, it's pretty bad. Okay.

01:14:03.690 --> 01:14:05.984
- Oh, is it bad?
- It's not that bad.

01:14:05.984 --> 01:14:08.027
- Is it that bad? Oh, fuck!
- It's not that bad.

01:14:08.027 --> 01:14:10.155
I just can't look at it.

01:14:10.155 --> 01:14:11.447
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

01:14:11.447 --> 01:14:13.199
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- Fuck!

01:14:13.199 --> 01:14:14.742
It's fine. It's fine.

01:14:15.368 --> 01:14:17.245
Did you just put it in your pocket?

01:14:17.245 --> 01:14:18.663
I didn't know where to put it.

01:14:18.663 --> 01:14:21.416
Oh, I'm gonna be sick now. Oh, fuck!

01:14:21.416 --> 01:14:23.877
Don't you throw up.
If you throw up, I'm gonna throw up.

01:14:23.877 --> 01:14:26.254
Don't throw up. Don't throw up.
Please don't throw up.

01:14:26.254 --> 01:14:29.757
- I won't throw up. You don't throw up.
- I won't throw up, if you don't throw up.

01:14:29.757 --> 01:14:31.467
- I'll trust you. Okay.
- Deal.

01:14:31.467 --> 01:14:33.469
Oh, God. Okay.

01:14:34.888 --> 01:14:37.473
- Just do something about it!
- I don't think I can do this.

01:14:38.183 --> 01:14:39.517
Give me a pep talk.

01:14:39.517 --> 01:14:42.270
- Just pull it out. You can do it.
- Okay.

01:14:42.270 --> 01:14:44.689
- I can do it?
- You can do it. Just pull it out. Okay?

01:14:44.689 --> 01:14:46.482
- One, two...
- Three, two...

01:14:46.482 --> 01:14:47.442
No, wait. No, wait.

01:14:47.442 --> 01:14:50.111
- Three! Two! One!
- Three! Two! One!

01:14:55.825 --> 01:14:57.410
I did it! I did it!

01:14:58.244 --> 01:14:59.787
You're not gonna...

01:15:08.004 --> 01:15:10.256
So anyway, I shoot the dude,

01:15:10.256 --> 01:15:12.842
he shoots another dude,
dude shoots another dude.

01:15:12.842 --> 01:15:16.012
Three dudes, one--
Four-- Three-- Three bullets.

01:15:16.012 --> 01:15:18.598
It was top ten all-time kills for me.
Hell, yeah!

01:15:18.598 --> 01:15:20.516
Yeah. Oh, is this...?

01:15:20.516 --> 01:15:23.436
- Are we high-fiving a murder?
- Yeah.

01:15:23.436 --> 01:15:25.730
Hey, where is your father now?

01:15:25.730 --> 01:15:27.899
Who the fuck knows?

01:15:27.899 --> 01:15:30.777
Let me tell you something.
If he is alive, I'm fucking killing him.

01:15:32.362 --> 01:15:34.405
Hey, Igor, what brought you here?

01:15:34.405 --> 01:15:36.407
Hey, thanks to you, Bert.

01:15:36.407 --> 01:15:38.076
- Me?
- Yeah.

01:15:38.076 --> 01:15:39.160
What?

01:15:39.160 --> 01:15:42.622
When I saw how you find joy
in every moment,

01:15:42.622 --> 01:15:46.167
it make me think, "Mafia is dangerous."

01:15:47.418 --> 01:15:48.795
Not easy life.

01:15:48.795 --> 01:15:53.383
And one day,
as I strangle man for not paying me for...

01:15:54.676 --> 01:15:55.885
ah, whatever,

01:15:55.885 --> 01:15:58.596
- I remembered something you say.
- What?

01:15:58.596 --> 01:16:02.558
You told me most important thing in life,

01:16:02.558 --> 01:16:04.602
it is to find your smile.

01:16:05.436 --> 01:16:06.562
- Oh!
- Eh?

01:16:07.272 --> 01:16:09.190
- Ho, ho, ho. Igor.
- Huh?

01:16:09.190 --> 01:16:11.484
I stole that from <i>City Slickers.</i>

01:16:12.026 --> 01:16:14.904
Billy Crystal? 1980s? Cowboys? Nothing?

01:16:14.904 --> 01:16:17.282
His whole deal is stealing shit.

01:16:17.282 --> 01:16:19.617
Back then, Irina. Okay?

01:16:19.617 --> 01:16:22.578
Hey, I just left. It was my choice.

01:16:22.578 --> 01:16:23.997
My smile.

01:16:23.997 --> 01:16:26.374
Mafia was not my smile.

01:16:26.374 --> 01:16:29.168
This was. Children, family, Sonia.

01:16:29.669 --> 01:16:33.214
In mafia, I would have died.

01:16:33.214 --> 01:16:35.925
But I have this, thanks to you, Bert.

01:16:35.925 --> 01:16:37.677
You saved my life.

01:16:41.514 --> 01:16:42.807
Good for you, Igor.

01:16:43.641 --> 01:16:45.518
Hey, at least
I didn't ruin his life, right?

01:16:50.481 --> 01:16:51.482
Bert?

01:16:57.030 --> 01:16:58.072
Bert?

01:17:02.035 --> 01:17:04.370
Hey. Are you asleep?

01:17:05.121 --> 01:17:06.122
Yeah.

01:17:06.664 --> 01:17:09.542
What is this thing you did
that made your daughter hate you?

01:17:15.006 --> 01:17:16.007
All right.

01:17:18.384 --> 01:17:22.096
So me and my big, fat friend Tom,
we're doing a podcast,

01:17:22.680 --> 01:17:25.391
and we get accidentally very fucked up.

01:17:26.768 --> 01:17:28.978
- That's not so bad.
- Wait for it.

01:17:28.978 --> 01:17:31.689
So Sasha's 15, right?
She's got her learner's permit.

01:17:32.315 --> 01:17:34.609
I'm like, "Hey, come out to me.

01:17:35.360 --> 01:17:38.154
Get my car, drive me home."
Right? Bam, bam.

01:17:39.697 --> 01:17:42.575
You asked your teenage daughter
to drive you home drunk?

01:17:42.575 --> 01:17:44.660
It gets worse, okay?

01:17:44.660 --> 01:17:46.120
She rolls a stop sign.

01:17:46.746 --> 01:17:48.081
Cop pulls her over.

01:17:50.541 --> 01:17:54.545
Turns out, having a parent in the car
doesn't count if the parent's trashed.

01:17:56.881 --> 01:18:00.718
She can't get her license for two years.
I got a misdemeanor. It was awful.

01:18:00.718 --> 01:18:03.262
Well, if that's everything,
that's not so bad.

01:18:03.971 --> 01:18:07.308
I wish that was the worst thing
my father ever did to me.

01:18:07.308 --> 01:18:09.352
It almost sounds nice.

01:18:11.562 --> 01:18:14.399
Four minutes before I passed out,
I started a livestream.

01:18:15.233 --> 01:18:17.402
And I livestreamed the entire event.

01:18:18.194 --> 01:18:19.821
It immediately went viral.

01:18:20.988 --> 01:18:22.949
Next weekend was Father's Day.

01:18:24.826 --> 01:18:26.327
She was so mad.

01:18:28.413 --> 01:18:30.581
Oh, God,
she didn't talk to me for a month.

01:18:32.792 --> 01:18:34.168
It was a wake-up call.

01:18:41.426 --> 01:18:45.888
I've been this party guy for so long,
I don't even know who I am anymore.

01:18:50.560 --> 01:18:56.065
Then maybe you're not supposed
to be only Bert.

01:18:58.776 --> 01:19:00.445
Look what you did for Igor.

01:19:01.696 --> 01:19:04.949
Your stupid drunk talk, it saved his life.

01:19:06.784 --> 01:19:08.161
I don't follow.

01:19:11.122 --> 01:19:14.333
We do not grow
by destroying part of ourselves.

01:19:14.834 --> 01:19:17.587
We grow
by finding a balance between parts.

01:19:18.838 --> 01:19:20.756
Balance like Steve Urkel.

01:19:23.426 --> 01:19:24.510
Did you just say "Urkel"?

01:19:24.510 --> 01:19:28.139
It's a reference to one of
my favorite American television shows.

01:19:28.139 --> 01:19:29.557
<i>Family Matters.</i>

01:19:29.557 --> 01:19:30.933
You know it?

01:19:30.933 --> 01:19:34.061
Yeah. Wait. But wait.
What the fuck's Urkel got to do with this?

01:19:34.061 --> 01:19:35.396
Oh!

01:19:35.396 --> 01:19:38.733
In season five,
Steve Urkel takes this potion

01:19:38.733 --> 01:19:43.070
that transforms him into Stefan Urquelle,
like, this cool version of him.

01:19:43.070 --> 01:19:45.364
Everyone starts hating him,
but what does he do?

01:19:45.364 --> 01:19:47.533
He doesn't surrender.

01:19:47.533 --> 01:19:49.035
He improves his formula,

01:19:49.035 --> 01:19:52.455
and in the end,
he gets best of both worlds.

01:19:53.122 --> 01:19:55.583
You are the Machine and Bert.

01:19:56.209 --> 01:19:57.877
You have both sides.

01:19:57.877 --> 01:20:00.880
But now you need to balance.

01:20:04.717 --> 01:20:05.551
I get it.

01:20:06.594 --> 01:20:08.179
Goddamn it.

01:20:08.971 --> 01:20:11.057
Can't believe I slept on <i>Family Matters.</i>

01:20:11.057 --> 01:20:13.976
Oh, you should definitely watch it.
It's very good.

01:20:16.103 --> 01:20:17.730
"Did I do that?"

01:20:17.730 --> 01:20:19.607
He watched it.

01:20:21.526 --> 01:20:24.654
When communists came,
politburo burned down the church

01:20:24.654 --> 01:20:26.781
and build this factory.

01:20:26.781 --> 01:20:29.909
When the communists leave, factory closed.

01:20:29.909 --> 01:20:33.079
When I came to the village,
I helped them build this.

01:20:33.079 --> 01:20:35.331
-  You built this?
-  No, no. Inside.

01:20:41.462 --> 01:20:44.173
I took you here
because building this place,

01:20:44.173 --> 01:20:46.217
feeling closer to God,

01:20:46.217 --> 01:20:48.719
taught me how to forgive myself.

01:20:48.719 --> 01:20:53.015
You know, for all the bad things
that I did, murders,

01:20:53.599 --> 01:20:55.059
all those years ago.

01:20:55.935 --> 01:20:59.605
Why do you think I hooked you up
with the train <i>banditti?</i>

01:20:59.605 --> 01:21:01.524
I don't know.
To show them a good time?

01:21:01.524 --> 01:21:03.442
<i>Da.</i> And?

01:21:04.652 --> 01:21:06.737
To keep your class safe.

01:21:07.655 --> 01:21:09.657
Train <i>banditti</i> are very dangerous.

01:21:09.657 --> 01:21:11.826
They do terrible things to the passengers.

01:21:11.826 --> 01:21:15.538
I introduced them to Machine
to distract them,

01:21:15.538 --> 01:21:18.291
<i>by doing what he always does.</i>

01:21:18.916 --> 01:21:21.377
Yeah. I robbed a lot of people, Igor.

01:21:21.377 --> 01:21:22.628
So?

01:21:23.170 --> 01:21:25.464
Was anyone hurt, killed?

01:21:25.464 --> 01:21:27.883
You spit in a girl's face.
You were an asshole.

01:21:27.883 --> 01:21:30.970
<i>- But your class, they were safe</i>

01:21:30.970 --> 01:21:34.098
because you did exactly
what you're supposed to do,

01:21:34.098 --> 01:21:37.184
by showing them good time,
making them laugh.

01:21:37.184 --> 01:21:39.520
You protected those people.

01:21:39.520 --> 01:21:42.815
That is what a man does.

01:21:44.025 --> 01:21:45.192
Goddamn it.

01:21:45.192 --> 01:21:47.445
Seems you're a good man, Bert.

01:21:49.405 --> 01:21:51.490
- Thanks, Irina.

01:21:51.490 --> 01:21:53.075
It's time to feed kids.

01:21:53.075 --> 01:21:56.454
Holy shit! That's the watch! Oh!

01:21:56.454 --> 01:21:57.747
My father's watch.

01:22:03.919 --> 01:22:05.671
How do you have that?

01:22:05.671 --> 01:22:08.341
You gave it to me when you left Russia.

01:22:08.341 --> 01:22:10.760
You said it was thank you
for being a true friend.

01:22:10.760 --> 01:22:12.803
You were very, very drunk.

01:22:14.138 --> 01:22:15.640
I was embarrassed taking it,

01:22:15.640 --> 01:22:17.975
but the words were nice,
so I just took it.

01:22:17.975 --> 01:22:19.810
Sweet, drunk words.

01:22:19.810 --> 01:22:20.895
God, yes.

01:22:21.520 --> 01:22:22.855
Let's go, Bert.

01:22:22.855 --> 01:22:24.690
I have an empire to claim.

01:22:25.608 --> 01:22:27.526
I would pay
to listen to her talk during sex.

01:22:27.526 --> 01:22:29.111
I would pay to have sex with her.

01:22:29.111 --> 01:22:30.905
Sorry about your bathroom.

01:22:30.905 --> 01:22:32.948
Thank you for taming the whore.

01:22:32.948 --> 01:22:34.617
No, thank you.

01:22:34.617 --> 01:22:36.285
I'll cherish these.

01:22:36.285 --> 01:22:38.287
The fuck am I supposed to do
with a chicken?

01:22:38.287 --> 01:22:41.457
Hey, Bert. I need to come clean.

01:22:41.457 --> 01:22:43.959
After train, I talked to Fedor, and...

01:22:44.710 --> 01:22:47.004
he gave me what you stole from class.

01:22:47.004 --> 01:22:51.133
Then everyone go back to U.S.A.,
so I kept it to remember.

01:22:51.133 --> 01:22:53.928
-  Hold on. No way.
-  Yeah.

01:22:54.637 --> 01:22:55.680
Dude.

01:22:55.680 --> 01:22:57.473
Hey, take it.

01:22:57.473 --> 01:22:59.975
And go to Moscow and save your father.

01:23:00.476 --> 01:23:03.729
If he's still alive.
He may have been tortured to death.

01:23:05.523 --> 01:23:06.691
I think she's autistic.

01:23:06.691 --> 01:23:07.650
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

01:23:07.650 --> 01:23:11.070
Hey, man. Thank you for everything, man.

01:23:11.070 --> 01:23:12.154
- No, no, no.
- No?

01:23:12.154 --> 01:23:13.781
You've been a good-luck charm to me.

01:23:13.781 --> 01:23:15.574
- My life changed the day I met you.
- Hey.

01:23:15.574 --> 01:23:17.034
- Bert, thank you.
- No, thank you.

01:23:17.034 --> 01:23:18.285
- No, thank you.
- No, thank you.

01:23:19.537 --> 01:23:22.707
- God. I'll miss you, brother.

01:23:22.707 --> 01:23:25.835
I'm gonna miss
these disgusting poor people.

01:23:27.294 --> 01:23:30.047
So you just think it and say it?
You don't stop it at all, right?

01:23:30.965 --> 01:23:32.383
Yes, basically.

01:23:33.175 --> 01:23:35.511
- Never met someone like myself before.
- Yeah.

01:23:35.511 --> 01:23:38.597

01:24:10.379 --> 01:24:12.214
So I keep having this recurring dream

01:24:12.214 --> 01:24:13.883
where Dolly Parton throws me her pick,

01:24:13.883 --> 01:24:16.051
calls me on-stage
and wants me to jam with her.

01:24:16.051 --> 01:24:17.136
I'm freaking shredding,

01:24:17.136 --> 01:24:19.638
but my fingers turn into spiders
and my teeth fall out.

01:24:19.638 --> 01:24:22.683
Pretty sure it's my heart medication
having a reaction with my sleeping pill.

01:24:22.683 --> 01:24:24.268
But, hey, it's better than doing acid,

01:24:24.268 --> 01:24:26.645
and kind of the highlight of my day
at this point.

01:24:27.146 --> 01:24:30.024
- It's sad but true.
- What the fuck is going on in here?

01:24:30.733 --> 01:24:32.026
Oh, hi, son.

01:24:35.112 --> 01:24:36.197
You two are buds now?

01:24:38.365 --> 01:24:40.659
Dad, why are you talking all fast
like you're on speed or something?

01:24:40.659 --> 01:24:44.413
'Cause I'm on speed.
And it is so, so, so, so great.

01:24:44.413 --> 01:24:46.957
Oh! More drugs.

01:24:46.957 --> 01:24:48.167
Ooh.

01:24:48.167 --> 01:24:50.753
Ooh! Oh.

01:24:50.753 --> 01:24:51.921
Look at me.

01:24:51.921 --> 01:24:54.089
I'm Molly Parton!

01:24:57.384 --> 01:24:58.886
You see what I did there?

01:25:00.638 --> 01:25:02.807
Irina. You're alive.

01:25:03.516 --> 01:25:06.685
- Super.
- Yes, asshole, I am alive.

01:25:06.685 --> 01:25:11.273
I brought the Machine,
and I even have the watch.

01:25:11.273 --> 01:25:14.193
So suck my dick.

01:25:14.193 --> 01:25:16.403
- Thanks.
- Fuck you, Sponge!

01:25:16.403 --> 01:25:18.280
No, fuck you.

01:25:18.280 --> 01:25:19.698
He pay me.

01:25:20.699 --> 01:25:21.742
You hit me.

01:25:22.243 --> 01:25:24.119
I should have left you in that gulag,

01:25:24.119 --> 01:25:26.247
with those doctors poking
and prodding you.

01:25:26.247 --> 01:25:28.999
I would string you up by your balls.

01:25:40.052 --> 01:25:41.053
Machine.

01:25:44.014 --> 01:25:45.224
I must say,

01:25:46.392 --> 01:25:47.977
your dad is so fun.

01:25:48.519 --> 01:25:50.980
He is the original Machine.

01:25:52.231 --> 01:25:53.440
I'm the prototype.

01:25:53.440 --> 01:25:55.359
He has been partying with us.

01:25:55.359 --> 01:25:59.154
Now, your mom was more of
a kind of missionary kind of gal,

01:25:59.154 --> 01:26:02.074
but Annika... Oh, ho!

01:26:02.074 --> 01:26:05.744
- She's got the cushion for the Pushkin.

01:26:06.453 --> 01:26:08.205
Oh, Dad, please stop.

01:26:08.205 --> 01:26:12.334
See, your dad has spent
so long looking after you,

01:26:12.334 --> 01:26:14.378
he never got a chance
to have fun on his own.

01:26:15.421 --> 01:26:16.505
Oh, ho!

01:26:16.505 --> 01:26:18.674
What a load of horseshit that is.

01:26:18.674 --> 01:26:21.844
Those Dolly Parton tickets
he was just bragging about? Front row?

01:26:21.844 --> 01:26:23.721
Who do you think bought them for him?

01:26:23.721 --> 01:26:26.140
And to think I thought
I was finally understanding you.

01:26:26.140 --> 01:26:29.310
I found your fucking knife.
Yeah, you want this piece of shit?

01:26:29.310 --> 01:26:31.145
When he kicked me off the train,

01:26:31.145 --> 01:26:32.938
I thought, "Maybe he's trying
to keep me safe,

01:26:32.938 --> 01:26:34.982
protect me or has a plan."

01:26:34.982 --> 01:26:38.027
But no plan. No fucking plan.

01:26:38.027 --> 01:26:40.029
You're just a big old dick!

01:26:40.905 --> 01:26:44.450
I may have let you down in this world.
You've pointed that out a lot.

01:26:44.450 --> 01:26:47.578
But you know what, Dad?
You have let me down.

01:26:47.578 --> 01:26:49.538
Just like I let Sasha down.

01:26:50.164 --> 01:26:53.083
I can't believe I thought
you were here to take care of me.

01:26:53.083 --> 01:26:55.669
Dad, take a fucking look around.

01:26:55.669 --> 01:26:57.171
You let me down!

01:26:59.548 --> 01:27:00.841
Son.

01:27:01.467 --> 01:27:04.094
I will always take care of you.

01:27:06.472 --> 01:27:07.473
What?

01:27:08.515 --> 01:27:11.977
You people threatened my granddaughter,

01:27:12.645 --> 01:27:14.438
you kidnapped my son,

01:27:14.438 --> 01:27:18.359
and made me do a lot of amazing drugs.

01:27:18.359 --> 01:27:22.071
And this is how we say thank you
in Florida.

01:27:24.740 --> 01:27:26.700
Holy shit!

01:27:30.120 --> 01:27:31.830
Motherfucking Eagle Scout.

01:27:31.830 --> 01:27:33.707
Oh, fuck!

01:27:33.707 --> 01:27:36.335
You have amazing tits!

01:27:36.335 --> 01:27:38.379
-  Oh, shit!

01:27:38.379 --> 01:27:39.838
I got the doors!

01:27:40.714 --> 01:27:41.548
God!

01:27:48.931 --> 01:27:50.349
I thought you were nonviolent.

01:27:50.349 --> 01:27:52.893
I am! But I also love my son!

01:27:52.893 --> 01:27:54.812
I knew you'd survive
falling off that train

01:27:54.812 --> 01:27:57.564
because of your big old boobies
and protective layers of fat.

01:27:58.273 --> 01:27:59.984
Oh, my God, you're so high right now.

01:27:59.984 --> 01:28:03.112
I am so high. I am so high!

01:28:03.112 --> 01:28:06.365
Idiots, stop talking and run.
I'll find the watch.

01:28:06.907 --> 01:28:08.450
Come on, come on, come on.

01:28:09.535 --> 01:28:11.453
Shit. Let's go, Keith Richards.

01:28:12.162 --> 01:28:13.580
Dad, come on! Stop lollygagging!

01:28:16.792 --> 01:28:18.877
God. All right.
Have a great night, everybody.

01:28:18.877 --> 01:28:20.337
Ooh, you're dropping your money.

01:28:20.337 --> 01:28:22.464
Don't drink and drive.
Grab a T-shirt on your way out.

01:28:22.464 --> 01:28:25.718
All right, have a good one.
Oh, here we go. The last ones out.

01:28:25.718 --> 01:28:27.845
Sorry for the gunfire, everybody.
Have a great night.

01:28:27.845 --> 01:28:29.763
Take care. Thank you very much.

01:28:30.848 --> 01:28:33.058
All right, Dad. We're good.

01:28:33.058 --> 01:28:35.561
Now, listen, I need you to use
this drug energy for good.

01:28:35.561 --> 01:28:37.104
All right? Like Charlie Sheen did.

01:28:37.604 --> 01:28:39.523
Oh, shit. Dad, get down.

01:29:08.343 --> 01:29:09.178
- Bert.
- Shh!

01:29:09.178 --> 01:29:10.679
- I lied.
- Stop talking.

01:29:10.679 --> 01:29:11.847
Come on, let's go.

01:29:12.890 --> 01:29:15.434
Look at me. I think I failed you as a dad.

01:29:15.434 --> 01:29:17.853
- Dad, be quiet.
- I can't.

01:29:17.853 --> 01:29:21.106
I'm feeling so many feelings,
and I need to tell you about them.

01:29:22.149 --> 01:29:23.317
Bert?

01:29:23.317 --> 01:29:24.443
- Bert?
- What?

01:29:25.235 --> 01:29:26.653
I need to say this.

01:29:26.653 --> 01:29:29.698
Instead of accepting you,
I criticized you.

01:29:29.698 --> 01:29:32.409
But it was only because
I wanted to keep you safe.

01:29:32.409 --> 01:29:34.328
Why have you never told me this?

01:29:34.328 --> 01:29:35.662
I don't know. It's...

01:29:35.662 --> 01:29:39.708
Vulnerability is scary,
and opening up is hard.

01:29:40.584 --> 01:29:42.878
- What drugs did they give you?
- Well, well, it was...

01:29:42.878 --> 01:29:44.421
Okay, come on. Let's go. Let's go.

01:29:44.421 --> 01:29:46.757
One was yellow,
but I don't know what it was.

01:29:49.301 --> 01:29:51.386
- Bert.
- Dad, shut the fuck up.

01:29:51.386 --> 01:29:52.763
This is important.

01:29:55.641 --> 01:29:57.851
- All dads mess up, Bert.

01:29:58.602 --> 01:30:00.479
But the good ones, we--

01:30:01.605 --> 01:30:03.232
We try to do better.

01:30:05.359 --> 01:30:08.070
I guess sometimes it just...

01:30:09.238 --> 01:30:10.697
takes us a while.

01:30:11.323 --> 01:30:12.950
You're my boy, Bert.

01:30:15.160 --> 01:30:16.829
Don't ever forget that.

01:30:17.496 --> 01:30:18.997
You'll always...

01:30:19.790 --> 01:30:21.291
be my boy.

01:30:28.257 --> 01:30:29.508
This is nice, Dad.

01:30:30.134 --> 01:30:32.970
You should do drugs more often.
Look at us.

01:30:32.970 --> 01:30:34.847
We're finally working through our shit.

01:30:39.351 --> 01:30:40.644
Dad, let's go!

01:30:41.895 --> 01:30:42.980
Goddamn!

01:30:42.980 --> 01:30:45.357
I just wish it had happened
before we were about to die!

01:30:45.357 --> 01:30:47.359
No, we're not gonna die.

01:30:47.901 --> 01:30:48.735
Here.

01:30:49.903 --> 01:30:52.948
You have always succeeded
by being exactly you.

01:30:52.948 --> 01:30:54.825
Now, take off that shirt

01:30:54.825 --> 01:30:58.495
and show those SOBs who you really are.

01:31:02.249 --> 01:31:03.250
Hey!

01:31:09.298 --> 01:31:10.132
Fuck.

01:31:30.027 --> 01:31:32.613
THE MACHINE

01:31:36.200 --> 01:31:39.453
Now you gotta party with me.

01:31:40.078 --> 01:31:41.371
Who the fuck are you?

01:31:41.371 --> 01:31:44.750
He's the motherfucking Machine!

01:31:51.298 --> 01:31:52.382
Oh, shit.

01:31:54.051 --> 01:31:57.012
I'm bulletproof, baby! Yeah!

01:31:57.012 --> 01:31:58.680
Come on! Yeah!

01:32:03.602 --> 01:32:05.604
Suck my dick, Captain America.

01:32:11.235 --> 01:32:12.236

01:32:29.211 --> 01:32:31.088

Oh!

01:32:49.773 --> 01:32:50.649
Not too bad.

01:32:50.649 --> 01:32:51.942
Oh!

01:32:57.322 --> 01:32:59.032

01:33:00.701 --> 01:33:03.036

01:33:05.080 --> 01:33:06.665
Here we go. Dad, Dad. Down, down.

01:33:08.333 --> 01:33:09.751

01:33:09.751 --> 01:33:10.919

Hey. Eagle Scout.

01:33:25.017 --> 01:33:27.519
We have a rematch.

01:33:34.109 --> 01:33:35.861

01:33:54.796 --> 01:33:56.715

01:34:08.143 --> 01:34:10.562
Oh, shit. Dad. Get off!

01:34:10.562 --> 01:34:12.314
Are you okay? You okay?

01:34:12.314 --> 01:34:15.067
I-- I saved you.

01:34:15.650 --> 01:34:16.777

Oh, shit. Shit. Let me see.

- You... are nothing...

01:34:29.956 --> 01:34:34.044
but an ignorant, fat American
who has no respect.

01:34:34.044 --> 01:34:36.880
Our father earned our respect.

01:34:40.509 --> 01:34:41.802
Your father...

01:34:42.803 --> 01:34:44.262
sells carpets.

owner and operator of Kreischer Karpets,

the best goddamn carpets
you can find in Southwest Florida!

Three convenient locations.

01:35:13.959 --> 01:35:15.544

01:35:15.544 --> 01:35:18.839
And if I ever see
your albino-looking ass again,

01:35:18.839 --> 01:35:20.549
I'm gonna whip it quick as a bitch.

01:35:20.549 --> 01:35:22.968
And last, but surely not least,

01:35:22.968 --> 01:35:25.220
I'm gonna need that knife back.
That's a family heirloom.

01:35:25.804 --> 01:35:26.721
Hm.

01:35:27.806 --> 01:35:29.975
- You want knife?
- Oh, yeah.

01:35:32.811 --> 01:35:34.855
Oh, I wouldn't--
I wouldn't do it that way, though.

01:35:35.772 --> 01:35:36.940
Uh-oh.

01:35:38.775 --> 01:35:41.445
I would have someone help you.
Oh, God. It's--

01:35:41.445 --> 01:35:44.281
Oh, my Jesus. That's how Steve Irwin died.

01:35:52.164 --> 01:35:54.875
Oh, my God.

01:35:55.834 --> 01:35:58.628
You work out every day? That's--
Looks like an everyday thing.

01:35:58.628 --> 01:36:00.922
- Enough talk.
- All right, yep.

01:36:03.133 --> 01:36:04.926
Oh. So now's when we bang, huh?

01:36:47.719 --> 01:36:49.012
Okay, here we go.

01:36:58.688 --> 01:37:00.273
So you can fight.

01:37:01.066 --> 01:37:02.359
I went to Florida State.

01:37:02.984 --> 01:37:05.362
All we know how to do is fight,
fuck, and drink.

01:37:05.946 --> 01:37:07.614
And I can't fuck worth shit.

01:37:33.139 --> 01:37:35.225
Oh. I just got that crown.

01:37:42.649 --> 01:37:45.110
Would you like to know
why I hate you, Machine?

01:37:45.110 --> 01:37:47.028
Oh, I'm dying to know.

01:37:47.028 --> 01:37:51.700
All my life, men were measured
against your stupid legend.

01:37:53.994 --> 01:37:55.370
"The best."

01:37:56.329 --> 01:37:57.789
"The man's man."

01:37:58.415 --> 01:37:59.833
I say, fuck that!

01:38:01.209 --> 01:38:03.461
So I worked
to make myself better than you.

01:38:04.170 --> 01:38:05.880
Stronger than you.

01:38:05.880 --> 01:38:07.757
Look at you now, Machine.

01:38:07.757 --> 01:38:09.259
You are nothing.

01:38:13.763 --> 01:38:16.433
So dramatic, Alexei.

01:38:16.433 --> 01:38:18.435
All these fucking speeches.

01:38:22.606 --> 01:38:23.607
Irina.

01:38:23.607 --> 01:38:27.611
Typical macho bullshit.

01:38:29.487 --> 01:38:32.282
- Oh, Dad!
- Whoa, whoa, my arm!

01:38:32.282 --> 01:38:34.618
- Oh, sorry, sorry, sorry.
- Son...

01:38:35.535 --> 01:38:37.537
you didn't show fear.

01:39:03.772 --> 01:39:04.731
Enough!

01:39:18.995 --> 01:39:21.790
Is this how I raised you?

01:39:30.382 --> 01:39:31.591
Your watch, Papa.

01:39:41.101 --> 01:39:43.478
I brought it here to return it to you.

01:39:51.152 --> 01:39:52.278
So...

01:39:55.990 --> 01:39:58.076
it's clear that I have won.

01:40:00.412 --> 01:40:04.290
Oh, Irina. My beautiful daughter.

01:40:04.999 --> 01:40:07.210
You want to take over?

01:40:07.210 --> 01:40:10.380
You cannot even kill brother.

01:40:10.380 --> 01:40:13.508
You become friends with idiot.

01:40:14.134 --> 01:40:16.678
I would never give this to you.

01:40:18.138 --> 01:40:20.390
Actually, can I step in for a second?

01:40:21.641 --> 01:40:24.352
I think you guys should talk it out.
Now, me and my dad...

01:40:25.311 --> 01:40:27.605
- This is Russia.
- Okay, okay.

01:40:27.605 --> 01:40:31.359
We don't do your weak,
America, lovey-huggy shit.

01:40:33.486 --> 01:40:36.948
Hugs are for pussies.

01:40:37.532 --> 01:40:39.075
Well, that explains a lot.

01:40:43.163 --> 01:40:46.040
Alexei understands.

01:40:47.125 --> 01:40:50.211
It is why he will run family.

01:40:51.004 --> 01:40:52.505
You are weak.

01:40:52.505 --> 01:40:54.758
A leader must be a wolf.

01:40:56.509 --> 01:40:59.554
Kill or be killed.

01:40:59.554 --> 01:41:01.556
If you do not like it,

01:41:02.932 --> 01:41:05.268
take it up with God.

01:41:07.270 --> 01:41:08.730
But you first.

01:41:32.295 --> 01:41:34.088
Did I do that?

01:41:36.758 --> 01:41:40.470
I am definitely watching
<i>Family Matters</i> when we get home.

01:42:03.159 --> 01:42:04.953
Look at that! Look at that! Look at that!

01:42:06.913 --> 01:42:10.083
Irina, we can work together.

01:42:10.083 --> 01:42:11.292
I am your brother.

01:42:11.292 --> 01:42:12.794
Shut the fuck up!

01:42:17.882 --> 01:42:20.218
Take him to our family <i>dacha</i>
while I decide

01:42:20.218 --> 01:42:22.929
which part of him to cut off
for his insolence.

01:42:24.222 --> 01:42:26.432
Fuck you, bitch. This is Russia.

01:42:26.432 --> 01:42:30.019
- Machine, I will kill you someday!

01:42:30.019 --> 01:42:31.980
- I don't think so.
-  I will come for you!

01:42:31.980 --> 01:42:34.065
- I don't know about that.
- Machine!

01:42:34.065 --> 01:42:36.234
- I can't hear you.
- I will come for you!

01:42:36.234 --> 01:42:38.695
Whoo! Go, me! Right?

01:42:38.695 --> 01:42:39.863
That was awesome!

01:42:39.863 --> 01:42:41.906
Thank you, Bert. You inspired me.

01:42:41.906 --> 01:42:42.824
Wait, how?

01:42:42.824 --> 01:42:45.201
When you said you're going
to kill your dad at Igor's house.

01:42:45.201 --> 01:42:48.413
- You said you were gonna kill me?
- Well, yeah. You kicked me off a train.

01:42:48.413 --> 01:42:50.999
Now go, before police shows up.

01:42:51.583 --> 01:42:52.667
- And, Bert.
- Yeah?

01:42:52.667 --> 01:42:54.210
Your daughter is sweet.

01:42:54.210 --> 01:42:56.838
My DJ friend tells me she's a good girl.

01:42:56.838 --> 01:42:59.799
- Some drugs. But smoke, not snort.
- Okay.

01:42:59.799 --> 01:43:01.551
- Good girl.
- Yeah.

01:43:07.140 --> 01:43:08.349
You're a good dad.

01:43:08.349 --> 01:43:09.684
Keep it up.

01:43:10.226 --> 01:43:13.396
Or else your daughter may kill you.

01:43:13.396 --> 01:43:15.565
Oh...

01:43:17.025 --> 01:43:18.109
Thanks, Irina.

01:43:19.527 --> 01:43:21.195
See you around, pussy boy.

01:43:39.756 --> 01:43:42.050
Hey, deuces. Bye.

01:43:42.050 --> 01:43:43.134
Bye, girl.

01:43:46.888 --> 01:43:48.723
- Dad?
-  Keep it, sir. Thank you.

01:43:48.723 --> 01:43:51.309
- Dad, look. Mom said that...
- Oh, my gosh!

01:43:51.309 --> 01:43:53.019
- There she is! Come here!
- What?

01:43:53.019 --> 01:43:54.646
Oh, my God, I love you.

01:43:54.646 --> 01:43:57.649
I am so sorry. You are a fantastic kid.

01:43:58.942 --> 01:44:01.736
No, look. I'm really sorry.
I was really mean at the party.

01:44:02.820 --> 01:44:05.156
Look at us. We're apologizing.

01:44:05.156 --> 01:44:07.075
I should be kidnapped to Russia
once a year

01:44:07.075 --> 01:44:09.577
- just to make this happen, right?
- What?

01:44:09.577 --> 01:44:11.162
Oh, there's the smile.

01:44:11.162 --> 01:44:13.456
You did that smile
when you were a little girl.

01:44:13.456 --> 01:44:15.249
You're still my little girl.

01:44:16.668 --> 01:44:18.586
Oh! And there's my woman.

01:44:18.586 --> 01:44:21.631
Oh, well, well.
It's nice to see you two back.

01:44:21.631 --> 01:44:24.092
I hope you worked out
your shit finally be--

01:44:28.054 --> 01:44:28.930
Mmm.

01:44:30.348 --> 01:44:31.349
Wow.

01:44:32.350 --> 01:44:33.476
The fuck are you wearing?

01:44:33.476 --> 01:44:36.646
- Oh, my God, what is that smell?
- Okay, these are clothes.

01:44:36.646 --> 01:44:38.189
I do not know what that smell is.

01:44:38.189 --> 01:44:39.774
- Did you go to Vegas?
- I did not go to Vegas.

01:44:39.774 --> 01:44:41.734
- Where's your dad?
- Dad's in Florida.

01:44:41.734 --> 01:44:44.278
He's got a doctor buddy he plays golf with
who doesn't ask any questions.

01:44:44.278 --> 01:44:46.072
We could all use one of those,
right, guys? Am I kidding?

01:44:46.072 --> 01:44:48.700
- Dad! Hey!
- Oh, there she is!

01:44:48.700 --> 01:44:50.159
From the top rope!

01:44:50.159 --> 01:44:51.911
Oh, my gosh!

01:44:51.911 --> 01:44:53.830
Oh, I love you! My favorite daughter!

01:44:53.830 --> 01:44:55.540
- Just kidding. I'm not kidding.
- Hey.

01:44:55.540 --> 01:44:57.750
I can't wait till you get kidnapped.

01:44:58.918 --> 01:45:01.129
- What?
- Guys, Dad's back!

01:45:01.129 --> 01:45:03.339
Dad's back! It's old-school Dad!

01:45:03.339 --> 01:45:04.674
How was your week?

01:45:05.216 --> 01:45:07.301
Oof. Complicated.

01:45:07.301 --> 01:45:10.513
<i>Dear Ashley, are you still hot? I'm not.</i>

01:45:10.513 --> 01:45:12.682
<i>I don't expect you to forgive me,</i>

01:45:12.682 --> 01:45:14.976
<i>but I wanted to keep my promise.</i>

01:45:14.976 --> 01:45:17.687
<i>Gifts are an important aspect
of Russian life.</i>

01:45:17.687 --> 01:45:19.689
<i>So are apologies.</i>

01:45:19.689 --> 01:45:21.232
<i>This is mine.</i>

01:45:21.941 --> 01:45:24.694
Last week,
the subject of your father came up,

01:45:24.694 --> 01:45:26.696
and I thought we could explore that.

01:45:27.697 --> 01:45:29.365
Jesus Christ, Dad. That Annika girl.

01:45:29.365 --> 01:45:32.660
- Did you wear condoms?
- Oh, oh, oh. Will you stop? Stop.

01:45:32.660 --> 01:45:34.245
- I'm just saying.
- I don't want to hear it again.

01:45:34.245 --> 01:45:35.913
Please put that down the memory hole.

01:45:35.913 --> 01:45:37.123
I can't, Dad.

01:45:37.123 --> 01:45:39.459
Since when do you have
such a razor-sharp memory?

01:45:39.459 --> 01:45:40.376
What happened--

01:45:40.376 --> 01:45:42.837
When you say things like,
"Your mom is a missionary woman."

01:45:42.837 --> 01:45:44.047
<i>Oh, no!</i>

01:45:44.047 --> 01:45:45.882
Nah, we're good.

01:45:46.591 --> 01:45:47.592
You and your father?

01:45:47.592 --> 01:45:50.261
Yeah. We're thick as thieves.
Butch and Sundance.

01:45:50.261 --> 01:45:51.345
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:45:52.388 --> 01:45:55.767
Well, if you don't mind,
can I ask how that resolved itself?

01:45:55.767 --> 01:45:57.935
You can ask, but I don't think
you're gonna believe me.

01:45:57.935 --> 01:45:59.604
Well, humor me.

01:46:00.772 --> 01:46:01.773
Hm...

01:46:03.232 --> 01:46:04.233
All right.

01:46:05.401 --> 01:46:08.029
When I was 48 years old,
I got involved with the Russian mafia.

01:46:08.029 --> 01:46:09.280
Here's how it happened.

01:46:10.364 --> 01:46:14.952
<i>♪ Father of mine
Tell me where have you been ♪</i>

01:46:14.952 --> 01:46:20.208
<i>♪ You know I just closed my eyes
My whole world disappeared ♪</i>

01:46:20.208 --> 01:46:24.837
<i>♪ Father of mine
Take me back to the day ♪</i>

01:46:24.837 --> 01:46:29.842
<i>♪ Yeah, when I was still your golden boy
Back before you went away ♪</i>

01:46:29.842 --> 01:46:34.806
<i>♪ I remember blue skies
Walking the block ♪</i>

01:46:34.806 --> 01:46:39.685
<i>♪ I loved it when you held me high
I loved to hear you talk ♪</i>

01:46:39.685 --> 01:46:44.649
<i>♪ You would take me to the movies
You would take me to the beach ♪</i>

01:46:44.649 --> 01:46:49.487
<i>♪ You would take me to a place inside
That is so hard to reach ♪</i>

01:46:58.830 --> 01:47:00.039
What's up, Florida?

01:47:00.039 --> 01:47:01.415
It's your boy, Bert Kreischer.

01:47:01.415 --> 01:47:02.959
The Machine.

01:47:02.959 --> 01:47:04.418
I love three things:

01:47:04.418 --> 01:47:05.878
- Having a great time...
-  Yeah!

01:47:05.878 --> 01:47:07.713
...making sure
other people have a great time,

01:47:07.713 --> 01:47:08.881
and quality carpets

01:47:08.881 --> 01:47:11.175
- delivered at a reasonable price.
-  Oh, yeah!

01:47:11.175 --> 01:47:13.219
That's why,
if you're looking for some acrylic,

01:47:13.219 --> 01:47:16.514
wool, plush, saxony, or level loop...

01:47:16.514 --> 01:47:18.099
None of that nylon shit.

01:47:18.099 --> 01:47:20.434
...you need to find your way
to a Kreischer Karpets.

01:47:20.434 --> 01:47:22.854
It's my dad's business,
and he's right here.

01:47:22.854 --> 01:47:24.105
Say hi, Dad.

01:47:24.814 --> 01:47:27.817
Hey, son. You can't say a swear on TV.

01:47:27.817 --> 01:47:30.695
The best goddamn carpets
in Southwest Florida.

01:47:30.695 --> 01:47:33.865
That's Kreischer Karpets,
spelled weirdly with a K.

01:47:33.865 --> 01:47:35.032
Take it off, Dad.

01:47:35.825 --> 01:47:37.160
Okay, fine.

01:47:40.538 --> 01:47:43.457
Did we mention we have
three convenient locations?
