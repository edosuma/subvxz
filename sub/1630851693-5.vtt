90 Day Fiance: The Other Way.</i>

00:02.769 --> 00:04.770
Oh, my God! Hey, baby.

00:04.804 --> 00:08.173
It feels so good
to be with Victor,

00:08.207 --> 00:11.076
<i>but I know we're gonna
have to face the truth</i>

00:11.111 --> 00:15.014
that our future is completely
unknown right now.

00:20.253 --> 00:22.021
[in spanish]

00:23.923 --> 00:25.290
Mmm-hmm.

00:38.605 --> 00:42.674
Because of Covid-19,
the border's closed to Russia.

00:42.709 --> 00:45.844
The goal is to, hopefully, from
Turkey we'll be able to go to Russia

00:45.879 --> 00:47.813
and we only have
90 days in Turkey

00:47.847 --> 00:50.382
because we're on tourist visas.

00:50.417 --> 00:51.917
<i>I feel like you have to know
someone in person</i>

00:51.951 --> 00:54.653
<i>before making
that big of a decision.</i>

00:54.687 --> 00:57.423
<i>This 90 days
is going to be crucial</i>

00:57.457 --> 01:01.093
for us to really get to know
each other to the level

01:01.127 --> 01:05.130
that we feel comfortable promising
each other the rest of our lives.

01:07.167 --> 01:08.867
Hello.

01:08.902 --> 01:11.070
[in spanish]

01:11.871 --> 01:14.940
I am feeling pressure to tell
my family about the big wedding

01:14.974 --> 01:18.043
<i>we're having because that's
what I came here to do...</i>

01:21.915 --> 01:24.149
but I just can't do it.

01:27.520 --> 01:30.789
- I think you have a lot of fear.
- [Sumit sighs]

01:30.824 --> 01:32.524
If you wanna marry me,
then you should marry me.

01:32.559 --> 01:34.660
If you don't,
then you should tell me,

01:34.694 --> 01:38.430
so I can go back to America
and not be here anymore.

01:38.698 --> 01:40.432
I'm done playing this game.

01:47.073 --> 01:49.408

01:53.546 --> 01:55.347
[Steven sighing]
It's hot out here.

02:01.754 --> 02:03.856
I can't get over the fact
this is where you live.

02:03.890 --> 02:07.226
This is so awesome.

02:26.079 --> 02:28.747
[Steven] I'm really excited
to be here with you,

02:28.781 --> 02:31.016
and I want you to feel same.

02:32.352 --> 02:34.920
I'm definitely
freaking out inside that

02:34.954 --> 02:38.524
<i>it's still gonna be a lot
bigger of a temptation for us</i>

02:38.558 --> 02:42.027
to mess up and to have sex,

02:42.061 --> 02:46.098
but I needed to show her
that she was my top priority.

02:46.900 --> 02:49.468
I mean, I get us a ride

02:49.636 --> 02:52.004
to our appointment
with the lawyer.

02:52.038 --> 02:53.805
He should really give us answers

02:53.840 --> 02:56.475
on wanting to move to Russia
and things like that.

02:56.509 --> 02:57.643
[Alina] Uh-huh.

02:57.677 --> 03:00.746
Alina and I are meeting
with an immigration lawyer

03:00.780 --> 03:02.648
because we need to find out
what the process is

03:02.682 --> 03:04.550
to get married in Turkey,

03:04.584 --> 03:08.053
<i>because we only have 90 days
on our tourist visa</i>

03:08.087 --> 03:11.156
to apply for the spousal visa
to go to Russia.

03:11.191 --> 03:13.458
I was thinking
we could just hitchhike there.

03:14.661 --> 03:16.328
[Alina speaking]

03:22.702 --> 03:25.637
I probably have hitchhiked
in at least five countries.

03:25.672 --> 03:27.940
- [giggling]
- It's true.

03:27.974 --> 03:31.543
It's a cheap
mode of transportation.

03:31.578 --> 03:34.279
[Alina speaking]

03:35.848 --> 03:38.550
[Steven] Trust me, it'll be
fine. We just gotta get someone.

03:38.585 --> 03:40.986
[Alina] Okay.

03:41.020 --> 03:43.655
Typically, what I do--
You kinda just like

03:43.690 --> 03:45.257
make eye contact with them,

03:45.291 --> 03:48.026
and kinda do like
a gesture like this, like,

03:48.061 --> 03:51.763
motioning that way,
looking at them, nodding,

03:51.798 --> 03:53.465
and then pointing to their car,

03:53.499 --> 03:54.900
<i>and then nodding again.</i>

03:54.934 --> 03:58.003
And I think that kinda conveys
the message pretty good.

03:58.972 --> 04:01.240
- Oh!
- [Alina sighs]

04:02.976 --> 04:05.277
[speaking foreign language]

04:13.920 --> 04:14.920
Okay. Sweet.

04:14.954 --> 04:18.023
Yeah, we'll go.
He understands me.

04:18.057 --> 04:19.091
All right. Let's go.

04:20.026 --> 04:23.195
[Alina speaking]

04:28.801 --> 04:31.003
Yeah. It's an adrenaline rush,
kind of.

04:31.838 --> 04:34.172
[laughs] I'm just kidding.

04:35.141 --> 04:37.042
[man speaking foreign language]

04:38.911 --> 04:41.346
- Okay.
- Let's go. [laughs]

04:44.717 --> 04:46.985
[Alina speaking]

04:47.987 --> 04:49.588
[Steven] Trust me,
I've done this a lot.

04:49.622 --> 04:50.856
If I get a bad feeling,

04:50.890 --> 04:53.358
I'll let you know
and you can jump out the car.

04:54.894 --> 04:56.828
Just open the car door
and you can roll out,

04:56.863 --> 04:58.430
or roll the window down.

05:03.102 --> 05:04.870
I'll ask him
if we're almost here.

05:04.904 --> 05:05.737
Uh...

05:05.772 --> 05:08.407
[speaking foreign language]

05:20.019 --> 05:22.120
[in english] It seems like
he knows where he's going.

05:23.156 --> 05:25.023
[man speaking]

05:26.225 --> 05:28.327
[Steven] All right.
See you later. Thank you.

05:29.195 --> 05:30.996
Awesome.

05:31.030 --> 05:34.099
[Alina speaking]

05:43.009 --> 05:45.110
We have a legal consultation?

05:46.112 --> 05:47.446
Yeah, I'm Steven.

05:50.516 --> 05:52.184
You have a sweet office.

05:54.854 --> 05:57.456
[Steven] Everything's really
new to us here.

05:57.523 --> 05:59.758
- She's a Russian, I'm American.
- Yeah.

05:59.792 --> 06:02.427
So we are here in Turkey
and our plan is to,

06:02.628 --> 06:04.329
hopefully, get married,

06:04.364 --> 06:06.264
that way we can move to Russia.

06:10.870 --> 06:12.137
- Okay.
- Okay.

06:27.920 --> 06:29.087
Mmm.

06:32.959 --> 06:34.226
Okay.

06:38.998 --> 06:40.232
Okay.

06:49.609 --> 06:51.042
Uh-huh.

06:51.577 --> 06:54.846
Okay. Do you have these
in a note somewhere

06:54.881 --> 06:57.349
that you can print out for us,
or should I write them down?

06:58.918 --> 07:01.453
- Uh-huh.
- Um...

07:16.736 --> 07:19.371
- Wow. Okay, that's a lot of steps.
- [laughs]

07:20.606 --> 07:22.941
[Tunay Egin speaking]

07:31.150 --> 07:34.953
How long does it take to get
that marriage appointment?

07:37.790 --> 07:39.624
Okay. Yeah, yeah. [chuckles]

07:39.659 --> 07:42.994
Okay. Hopefully not a lot
of people are getting married.

07:45.064 --> 07:47.466
<i>It appears that it'll take
a little bit longer</i>

07:47.500 --> 07:49.568
than I had been expecting.

07:49.602 --> 07:53.605
I thought we would just go
to a courthouse or something,

07:53.639 --> 07:57.042
kinda like in Vegas,
and just kinda make it happen.

07:57.076 --> 08:01.213
We are really nervous,
just because we are on

08:01.247 --> 08:03.982
- the 90-day tourist visa.
- Mmm-hmm.

08:13.960 --> 08:16.862
[both laugh]

08:16.896 --> 08:19.030
Yeah. I think that will be
the harder part.

08:23.002 --> 08:25.070
It's a big decision.

08:25.104 --> 08:28.139
I mean, kinda.
It's pretty big.

08:30.142 --> 08:32.310
[Alina speaking]

08:44.624 --> 08:47.025
Yeah. Thank you. Um...

08:47.793 --> 08:50.128
We definitely have
a lot to think about now.

09:11.751 --> 09:14.553
Yesterday, Victor and I
were finally reunited

09:14.587 --> 09:17.188
which was amazing,

09:17.857 --> 09:21.393
<i>but the reason
Victor came to San Andres</i>

09:21.427 --> 09:25.230
<i>was to get supplies to bring
back to his sister, Mary,</i>

09:25.264 --> 09:29.100
<i>so we're taking the boat
back to Providencia.</i>

09:30.169 --> 09:31.937
I don't want to throw up
in my mask.

09:31.971 --> 09:34.172
[both laugh]

09:36.242 --> 09:38.276
[Ellie] It seems pretty calm.

09:42.081 --> 09:43.715
Okay, we did it.

09:43.749 --> 09:45.450
Oh.

09:48.120 --> 09:50.889
<i>We had to arrive early
to get on the boat</i>

09:50.923 --> 09:53.892
<i>because it leaves at dawn.</i>

09:53.926 --> 09:56.027
It takes four hours
to get to Providencia,

09:56.062 --> 09:59.097
then we have four hours
on the island,

09:59.131 --> 10:02.100
and then four hours to get back.

10:02.134 --> 10:03.435
[Victor speaking]

10:03.970 --> 10:06.271
Yeah, definitely.

10:21.420 --> 10:23.254
[Ellie speaking]

10:31.163 --> 10:35.767
<i>[Ellie] As far as I know, the
situation on the island is very extreme.</i>

10:35.801 --> 10:37.435
<i>It's very dire.</i>

10:41.974 --> 10:45.410
And, honestly, I'm pretty
scared to go there.

10:48.948 --> 10:50.415
[Victor speaking]

10:56.088 --> 10:57.455

[Victor speaking]

11:09.435 --> 11:11.036
[Ellie speaking]

11:19.145 --> 11:22.614
Seeing the island, it was--

11:22.648 --> 11:24.315
It was just shocking.

11:25.151 --> 11:28.186
<i>The island used to be
so lush and green.</i>

11:35.027 --> 11:36.394
[Victor speaking]

12:19.071 --> 12:20.271
Yeah.

12:22.942 --> 12:25.043
Oh, my God!

[Victor in foreign language]

12:35.855 --> 12:37.088
[in english]

12:37.757 --> 12:39.691
Okay.

12:39.725 --> 12:43.561
<i>Victor's friend, Darwin, said
that we could borrow his car.</i>

12:43.596 --> 12:46.231
We brought supplies,
so we need the car

12:46.265 --> 12:49.968
to bring those supplies over
to Victor's sister's house.

12:50.035 --> 12:51.069
Good luck.

12:54.006 --> 12:55.273
Come back, okay?

13:06.152 --> 13:09.387
The first thing,
you get this intense smell

13:09.421 --> 13:11.923
of like a mixture of gas

13:11.957 --> 13:15.160
<i>and sewage and garbage and...</i>

13:15.928 --> 13:19.430
It's an apocalyptic feeling.

13:21.934 --> 13:24.803
<i>It's extremely stressful
being on the island</i>

13:24.837 --> 13:27.438
<i>and just seeing it this way.</i>

13:28.774 --> 13:31.276
<i>This was supposed to be my home,</i>

13:31.710 --> 13:34.445
and I just feel heartbroken.

13:40.452 --> 13:42.954
I guess, how do you even explain

13:42.988 --> 13:45.423
the difference, right now,

13:45.457 --> 13:47.992
<i>if you've never
been here before?</i>

13:49.528 --> 13:52.297
It was like a bomb went off.

13:55.201 --> 13:59.103
This was the most paradise
place I've ever seen.

13:59.672 --> 14:02.140
It's so crazy.

14:05.411 --> 14:08.713
<i>I love Victor,
and I wanna be there for him,</i>

14:08.747 --> 14:12.951
but this is not the way
we imagined it.

14:12.985 --> 14:16.054
<i>It's gonna be really hard,
but I'm willing to try,</i>

14:16.088 --> 14:18.256
<i>in order for us to be together.</i>

14:20.726 --> 14:25.463
Yeah. I've never witnessed
anything like this.

14:26.765 --> 14:30.134
I don't know
how to survive like this.

14:30.536 --> 14:32.303
<i>I'm in shock.</i>

14:38.510 --> 14:40.745
<i>[Jenny] I feel left out.
Once again, not included</i>

14:40.779 --> 14:43.381
<i>in a celebration
with Sumit's family.</i>

14:43.415 --> 14:45.316
I don't really need
to be putting up with this.

14:46.085 --> 14:48.219
[in spanish]

15:05.337 --> 15:07.171
[hindi music playing]

15:24.456 --> 15:26.157
[Jenny] You know,
I love these markets.

15:31.063 --> 15:32.897
<i>I've been
in a relationship with Sumit</i>

15:32.932 --> 15:34.933
<i>for almost nine years now,</i>

15:34.967 --> 15:37.268
<i>and I love him and he loves me,</i>

15:37.303 --> 15:39.270
but it's really stressful.

15:39.939 --> 15:41.339
Hello.

15:43.208 --> 15:44.809
Are they all 108 beads?

15:44.843 --> 15:46.411
[Sumit speaking]

15:47.913 --> 15:52.083
Okay. I'm looking
at the red ones.

15:52.785 --> 15:54.686
<i>When I visited
the ISKCON Temple,</i>

15:54.720 --> 15:58.089
I got such a sense of peace
from chanting,

15:58.123 --> 16:00.158
<i>so I asked Sumit
to take me to the market,</i>

16:00.192 --> 16:02.126
<i>so I can buy my own beads.</i>

16:02.795 --> 16:04.128
[Sumit speaking]

16:04.163 --> 16:06.130
Yeah. The red colored ones.

16:06.765 --> 16:08.333
Okay.

16:10.002 --> 16:12.570
<i>I don't really think
I want to become</i>

16:12.604 --> 16:13.871
<i>a Hare Krishna devotee,</i>

16:13.906 --> 16:15.807
but I'm just hoping
that the chanting

16:15.841 --> 16:17.508
that I learned
at the ISKCON temple

16:17.543 --> 16:21.279
helps me stay calmed down
and less stressed out.

16:22.982 --> 16:25.883
I'm happy to have these because
the experience at the temple,

16:25.918 --> 16:28.720
at ISKCON, it was really nice.

16:28.754 --> 16:31.789
It felt like such a positive
experience for me,

16:31.824 --> 16:35.226
because dealing with so much
stress and hate...

16:47.873 --> 16:49.407
That's very true.

16:49.441 --> 16:51.809
Really, that day
your parents came over,

16:51.843 --> 16:54.746
that whole experience,
stays in my mind.

16:54.780 --> 16:56.881
I'm always, constantly hearing
your parents.

16:56.915 --> 16:59.450
It's like I don't understand
what they're saying,

17:00.019 --> 17:01.452
but still I know
what they're saying.

17:01.553 --> 17:03.287
[in hindi]

17:17.770 --> 17:20.571
It just kinda like
knocked me on my ass.

17:20.606 --> 17:23.775
Like, wow, I am really hated
by these people.

17:23.809 --> 17:26.411
They really want me
away from their son.

17:36.889 --> 17:40.958
The situation that I'm in is,
it's difficult.

17:40.992 --> 17:44.996
It's very difficult to be
so insulted by them

17:45.064 --> 17:46.931
<i>and so hated by them.</i>

17:46.965 --> 17:49.967
I'm still a human being,
even though I'm this old.

17:50.536 --> 17:52.403
You know, what I see is,

17:52.438 --> 17:54.972
your parents have done
a lot of wrong to you.

17:55.441 --> 17:57.341
Every time they call you
and say,

17:57.375 --> 18:01.145
come for this reason,
come for that reason, you go.

18:01.180 --> 18:03.714
Sometimes I wish you would
just tell them, "No, I'm not coming,"

18:03.749 --> 18:05.416
because I feel left out.

18:06.518 --> 18:10.455
I am starting to reach
my breaking point with Sumit.

18:10.589 --> 18:13.057
He does need to fix this.
He needs to tell his parents.

18:13.092 --> 18:15.660
<i>If I'm so important in his life</i>

18:15.694 --> 18:17.829
<i>and he loves me so much,</i>

18:17.863 --> 18:19.530
<i>then he needs
to stand up to them.</i>

18:19.565 --> 18:21.933
<i>I don't have
any of my family here at all,</i>

18:21.967 --> 18:23.901
so being with Sumit and his
family would be great for me.

18:23.936 --> 18:27.705
It would be wonderful. Be
a dream come true, actually.

18:27.739 --> 18:30.041
Any sort of family thing
that happens,

18:30.075 --> 18:30.908
you have to go home for that,

18:30.943 --> 18:34.212
and I'm left at home by myself.

18:34.246 --> 18:37.415
It does make me sad.
It does hurt me.

18:46.859 --> 18:48.025
- Uh-oh.
- Uh...

18:57.603 --> 19:02.440
Beautiful. Congratulations,
you guys, on your marriage.

19:02.908 --> 19:05.376
<i>Sumit's brother,
Amit and Shree got married</i>

19:05.410 --> 19:07.512
<i>soon after the lockdown lifted.</i>

19:07.546 --> 19:09.413
Shree seems to be
the perfect daughter-in-law.

19:09.448 --> 19:12.783
I mean, she's young,
she's beautiful, she's Indian,

19:12.818 --> 19:15.920
<i>and she's getting ready to
give them their first grandchild.</i>

19:15.954 --> 19:18.422
How can I even
compete with that?

19:18.457 --> 19:20.458
When did you find this out?

19:32.871 --> 19:35.339
Yeah, so here we go.

19:36.441 --> 19:38.910
<i>I feel left out.
Once again, not included</i>

19:38.944 --> 19:41.612
<i>in a celebration
with Sumit's family.</i>

19:41.647 --> 19:43.314
It's very hurtful.

19:43.982 --> 19:45.750
I do feel left out
and I do feel bad.

19:45.784 --> 19:49.587
Like I can't give
your parents a grandchild,

19:49.621 --> 19:52.790
but I can love their son and
treat him the best way that I can.

19:52.824 --> 19:56.327
I wish that they would just be
happy about that, you know.

20:00.432 --> 20:02.667
It's stressful.
It puts a lot of stress on me.

20:02.701 --> 20:04.402
It makes me sad.

20:04.436 --> 20:06.437
It makes me miss my daughters,

20:06.572 --> 20:08.940
because, you know, they love me.

20:08.974 --> 20:11.709
When it comes
to you and your family,

20:11.743 --> 20:12.810
I'm no part of anything at all.

20:12.844 --> 20:15.446
I'm just left, sitting at home,

20:15.480 --> 20:18.382
waiting for the day that
maybe I will be a part of it.

20:20.118 --> 20:24.322
What can I do, you know?
I can't do anything about it.

[guitar music playing]

[in spanish]

21:11.703 --> 21:14.438
It's our second day in San
Felipe, and while I decided

21:14.473 --> 21:18.075
<i>not to tell my parents about
our wedding plans last night,</i>

21:18.109 --> 21:20.778
I can't wait any longer
and I need to talk to them.

21:20.812 --> 21:23.714
[in spanish]

21:23.749 --> 21:26.117
We're already starting
to plan the wedding,

21:26.151 --> 21:28.019
and I think it's better
for them to know now,

21:28.053 --> 21:31.155
so they can start planning as
well, if they're gonna be there for us.

21:31.923 --> 21:35.026
[both in spanish]

21:40.966 --> 21:42.466
I've decided
to talk to my mom first

21:42.634 --> 21:43.901
before approaching my dad,

21:43.935 --> 21:48.472
<i>because I remember when I told
my whole family I was engaged,</i>

21:48.507 --> 21:51.909
she's like, "You should
have told me first."

21:51.943 --> 21:54.045
But I also want to find out
what I have to do,

21:54.079 --> 21:57.014
uh, to approach my dad.

21:59.017 --> 22:00.351
[both in spanish]

22:53.638 --> 22:57.441
Last year, my mom told me not to
tell my dad about our engagement.

22:57.476 --> 23:00.745
She said she would be the one
to tell him when she saw fit,

23:00.779 --> 23:02.780
<i>but I never thought she
wouldn't ever tell him.</i>

23:02.814 --> 23:05.950
<i>You know. And so it kinda
makes me wonder</i>

23:05.984 --> 23:08.652
<i>if she's still struggling
with it herself,</i>

23:08.686 --> 23:09.987
<i>uh, can't come to terms with it,</i>

23:10.021 --> 23:13.157
and therefore can't even talk
to my dad about it.

23:14.226 --> 23:16.227
[both in spanish]

say that she accepts me,</i>

25:16.848 --> 25:20.584
but on the other hand, I
don't think she's happy for me.

25:20.619 --> 25:23.988
I think she supports me.
She wants to be there for me.

25:24.022 --> 25:27.992
She wants to show me
that she loves me,

25:28.026 --> 25:30.194
but she's not happy for me.

25:33.098 --> 25:35.199
[both in spanish]

25:59.758 --> 26:01.959
Mmm...

26:30.589 --> 26:34.024
You're down to marry me
in just a week?

26:37.162 --> 26:42.032
I'm not at the same level
of readiness as you are.

[Ellie] You did it!

27:37.722 --> 27:39.156
You did it.

27:40.759 --> 27:42.960
We've just arrived
in Providencia,

27:42.994 --> 27:46.063
and Victor was able
to borrow a car from a friend,

27:46.097 --> 27:49.967
<i>so we can bring the supplies
to his sister and her kids.</i>

27:59.210 --> 28:01.111
It's very bad.

28:06.084 --> 28:08.385
[Victor speaking]

28:10.989 --> 28:12.356
Uh...

29:13.084 --> 29:15.085
I am so sorry.

29:17.789 --> 29:19.923
So this is like
a bunch of clothes.

29:19.958 --> 29:24.128
I just bought some different
sizes, you know what I mean.

29:35.907 --> 29:39.309
I definitely was,
"I gotta get there."

29:43.481 --> 29:45.449

right there, right?

29:49.921 --> 29:54.024
<i>[Ellie] It's very hard

29:54.058 --> 29:56.426
Victor and his sister
are going through

29:56.460 --> 29:58.395
a lot of trauma right now,

29:58.429 --> 30:01.098
and trauma changes you.

30:17.148 --> 30:19.016
Oh, my gosh!

30:19.050 --> 30:20.417
That is...

I'm so sorry.

31:30.822 --> 31:33.190
We're in it together, okay?

[Alina speaking]

32:02.620 --> 32:04.254
[upbeat music playing]

32:24.676 --> 32:27.945
All right, let's grab a taxi.
Let's go home.

32:27.979 --> 32:31.214
This street is too busy, I
don't want to hitchhike here.

32:34.719 --> 32:36.720
Alina and I are on the way home

32:36.754 --> 32:38.455

the immigration lawyer.

32:43.661 --> 32:45.729
in order to get married
here in Turkey,

32:45.763 --> 32:48.732
so I can apply for
a spousal visa into Russia.

32:48.766 --> 32:51.168
I think I was so focused
on us getting here

32:51.202 --> 32:53.737
that I didn't have time
to think about

32:53.771 --> 32:56.506
how many things we have to do

32:56.541 --> 32:59.876
in order to even just get
married here, you know.

32:59.910 --> 33:01.979
At least for me, that made
it feel a lot more real.

33:02.013 --> 33:04.348
Did that make it feel
really real for you?

33:11.122 --> 33:13.190
What do you mean, his advice?

33:21.099 --> 33:22.766
Uh... [chuckles nervously]

33:22.800 --> 33:25.035
Yeah, um...

33:28.072 --> 33:29.873
There was already
a lot of pressure

33:29.907 --> 33:34.411
under the 90-day limit
that we had to stay in Turkey

33:34.445 --> 33:36.747
<i>because we know
that we want to get married,</i>

33:36.781 --> 33:40.350
but we don't really know
each other all the way yet.

wanna get married even faster</i>

33:44.956 --> 33:46.456

we need to discuss together,</i>

33:50.695 --> 33:54.998
before making that biggest
decision of our lives.

33:56.768 --> 34:02.339
I can't really see us expedite
it much more than 50 days.

34:03.875 --> 34:08.111
When do you think you'd be
ready to make that decision?

34:15.253 --> 34:16.987
- Really?
- Yeah.

34:19.057 --> 34:20.257
Wow!

34:27.832 --> 34:31.968
I just-- Yeah, I mean,
I guess I was really surprised

34:32.003 --> 34:34.237
you don't even want
to be cuddly, right now.

34:34.639 --> 34:35.806
Now you're saying

34:35.840 --> 34:39.409
you're down to marry me
in just a week?

35:06.871 --> 35:10.974
I kinda pictured us like me
coming here to Antalya,

35:11.008 --> 35:13.710
and leaving my job,
and my family,

35:13.744 --> 35:16.246
and my friends, and my home,

35:16.747 --> 35:19.749
and leaving all that was
kinda me saying to you

35:19.784 --> 35:23.086
that I am ready for
a serious relationship.

35:23.888 --> 35:27.357
I just feel like...

level of readiness as you are.

35:36.467 --> 35:39.636

35:39.670 --> 35:42.706
is not something that I want
to be a fair weather vow.

35:42.740 --> 35:44.941
It's not something
that I just want...

35:44.976 --> 35:46.710
We're married
just because it's cool

35:46.744 --> 35:47.911
and we like each other,

35:47.945 --> 35:49.379
but then once things
start going south,

35:49.413 --> 35:51.915
then we just like abandon ship.

are taking this seriously</i>

like scientists come here

see if it has some kind of...

50:28.759 --> 50:32.094
different water than
in other places in the world?

<i>So, I've decided that I need
to be the one to tell him.</i>

Having this conversation with

56:07.797 --> 56:09.531
<i>When I came out the first time,</i>

you know, my mom was the one
to tell him that I was gay.

56:13.469 --> 56:18.774
And he drove me Downtown and
we sat there watching the cars go by.

56:18.808 --> 56:22.344
You know, there was no
conversation, there was nothing said.

56:22.379 --> 56:25.781
We just sat there
in silence basically.

56:25.815 --> 56:30.185
We just have never talked things out,
we have never expressed our feelings.

56:40.797 --> 56:44.066
Um, but I don't.

56:44.968 --> 56:48.404
He's your dad
and you're his son.

56:48.872 --> 56:51.540
So, hopefully,
at the end of all this,

56:51.574 --> 56:56.412
his love for you will prevail
and, you know,

56:56.446 --> 56:59.415
- he'll support you.
- Yeah, I hope that he will.

There's, I think, a lot riding on this
conversation Armando wants to have with his dad,

57:43.426 --> 57:47.429
because he put up walls for
many years with his family.

dad would show that he's proud of him,

that he's accomplished,

58:18.595 --> 58:22.130

That's why I was, like,

1:12:05.321 --> 1:12:07.722
taking so long to stand up,
you know.

1:12:07.756 --> 1:12:10.591

told her family we're already married,

1:12:10.625 --> 1:12:12.894

1:12:18.367 --> 1:12:19.434
It's getting cold.

1:12:23.672 --> 1:12:26.441
Yeah, dude, it was so sick.
So fun. It was too good.

1:12:26.809 --> 1:12:28.276
Too good. We ought to
do it more often.

1:12:29.111 --> 1:12:30.578
I know.

1:12:30.612 --> 1:12:32.714
<i>Raul is my best friend
in Ecuador.</i>

1:12:32.748 --> 1:12:35.917
Me and Raul have had,
you know, our ups and down,

1:12:35.951 --> 1:12:39.387

now, though. We've moved past that.

1:12:39.888 --> 1:12:41.289
[Raul speaking]

1:12:42.725 --> 1:12:44.826
I've been dealing with
a lot, man.

1:12:44.860 --> 1:12:47.995
Like, me and Evelin, you know
she's never been into, like,

1:12:48.030 --> 1:12:50.365
getting married
or anything like that.

1:12:50.399 --> 1:12:52.533
- You know her pretty well.
- Yeah.

1:12:52.568 --> 1:12:54.369
Well, I'm just going to straight
up tell you right now, dude.

1:12:54.403 --> 1:12:57.138
We got married for real, dude,
like a year ago.

1:13:01.710 --> 1:13:06.114
Me and Evelin. We've been married
in secret for like a year now, dude.

1:13:09.017 --> 1:13:11.119
I didn't even tell
my own family, okay?

1:13:11.420 --> 1:13:12.520
My visa was running out.

1:13:12.554 --> 1:13:14.856
It was all very spur of
the moment, very quick.

1:13:14.890 --> 1:13:20.395
She has been so, like, on it
about me not telling anybody.

1:13:20.729 --> 1:13:23.064
I think the reason why,

1:13:23.098 --> 1:13:24.899
the reason why she was like,
"We're not telling anybody,"

1:13:24.933 --> 1:13:27.635
is because I think
her whole plan was to just

1:13:27.669 --> 1:13:31.139
have an escape route,
you know what I mean?

1:13:31.173 --> 1:13:34.008
She said this, "When I'm
ready to get married for real,

1:13:35.077 --> 1:13:36.444
then I'll let you
know about it."

1:13:36.678 --> 1:13:38.413
You know.

1:13:38.447 --> 1:13:41.149
So we got married,
legally, in secret,

1:13:41.183 --> 1:13:44.452
and then you'll remember this, a
few months later, she kicks me out.

1:13:44.486 --> 1:13:46.654
She says,

1:13:46.688 --> 1:13:50.291
"Get out of here, like I don't want
you here anymore, we are done, okay?"

1:13:51.193 --> 1:13:53.261
<i>I had just gotten married,</i>

1:13:53.896 --> 1:13:56.264
and Evelin

1:13:56.498 --> 1:13:59.934
suddenly doesn't want to
be with me anymore.

1:13:59.968 --> 1:14:04.005
<i>'Cause she felt I wasn't giving her
the attention she desired and needs.</i>

1:14:04.039 --> 1:14:08.309
She's like, "I do not want to see you
anymore. We're done. We are broken up.

1:14:09.445 --> 1:14:12.213
Stay away from Ecuador,
do not come back."

1:14:12.247 --> 1:14:15.149
I was heartbroken, man.
Heartbroken, dude.

1:14:15.184 --> 1:14:17.418
Like, you know
how I am for Evelin.

1:14:18.587 --> 1:14:20.288
So I went to Peru, right?

1:14:20.956 --> 1:14:23.057
You remember that girl
I told you about?

1:14:25.694 --> 1:14:27.829
Shortly after I got back
from Peru,

1:14:27.863 --> 1:14:30.731
<i>I told Raul that I had
a little fling with somebody.</i>

1:14:30.766 --> 1:14:33.100
<i>But I didn't really tell him
the full story.</i>

1:14:33.802 --> 1:14:37.138
Well, it was a little
more serious than I led on.

1:14:40.876 --> 1:14:44.045
It was serious, you know, like,
she introduced me to her family.

1:14:47.416 --> 1:14:50.284
And we were gonna actually
get a place together.

1:14:51.854 --> 1:14:55.556
But Evelin doesn't know any of that, she
just thinks it's a one-night thing and...

1:14:55.591 --> 1:14:57.091
Gone, you know, kind of thing.

1:15:25.921 --> 1:15:29.357
I believed that me and Evelin
were 100% done.

1:15:30.025 --> 1:15:33.427
When I got back
to get all my stuff,

1:15:33.795 --> 1:15:37.031
my surfboards, my--
Everything that I have here,

1:15:37.833 --> 1:15:38.966
the pandemic hit.

1:15:39.001 --> 1:15:42.637
Due to quarantine,
me and Evelin kind of...

1:15:42.671 --> 1:15:45.039
started mending things
back together,

1:15:45.073 --> 1:15:48.943
and I had stopped talking
with Jenny.

1:15:51.647 --> 1:15:53.881
<i>I lied to Evelin</i>

1:15:53.916 --> 1:15:57.118
when I told her
I wasn't intimate with Jenny.

1:15:58.186 --> 1:16:02.790
I told Evelin that I did see
a girl while I was in Peru,

1:16:02.824 --> 1:16:04.592
um...

1:16:04.626 --> 1:16:07.428
I didn't tell her
just how serious it was,

1:16:07.462 --> 1:16:11.599
I didn't tell her that we were
in any kind of relationship.

1:16:11.633 --> 1:16:15.102
Dude, I'm so torn right now,
I don't know what to do, man.

1:16:15.136 --> 1:16:17.972
I'm trying coming to you
for help right now.

1:16:23.979 --> 1:16:26.647
I want to do that so badly,

1:16:26.682 --> 1:16:28.983
but I feel bad,
you know, like...

1:16:30.719 --> 1:16:33.621
I never actually,
fully ended things with Jenny.

1:16:33.655 --> 1:16:35.256
I did cut communication.

1:16:35.290 --> 1:16:37.458
I was not talking to her
for many months,

1:16:37.559 --> 1:16:38.826
<i>and I just left it at that.</i>

1:16:38.860 --> 1:16:40.561
<i>I didn't reach out
to her anymore</i>

1:16:40.596 --> 1:16:42.697
once I realized
that me and Evelin

1:16:42.731 --> 1:16:45.333
did have an opportunity
to fix our relationship.

1:16:47.970 --> 1:16:51.939
What do you think as someone
who knows Evelin very well,

1:16:51.973 --> 1:16:54.175
and someone
who knows me very well,

1:16:54.209 --> 1:16:56.043
what should I do?

1:17:04.953 --> 1:17:06.220
Yeah.

1:17:16.898 --> 1:17:18.165
[speaking foreign language]

1:17:28.977 --> 1:17:32.013
[dramatic music playing]

1:17:52.734 --> 1:17:54.368
[speaking foreign language]

1:19:59.027 --> 1:20:01.762
[Armando speaking English] <i>I've lived
my life trying to make my parents proud,</i>

1:20:01.797 --> 1:20:04.632
<i>trying to make them happy,</i>

1:20:04.666 --> 1:20:07.902
and being gay was definitely
something nobody would be proud of.

1:20:07.936 --> 1:20:10.304
And I was ashamed of that
for many years.

1:20:12.874 --> 1:20:17.812
So it's beautiful to hear that he
is pleased with who I became and

1:20:17.846 --> 1:20:20.347
what I... what I've done
throughout my life.

1:20:24.753 --> 1:20:26.253
[speaking foreign language]

1:21:18.940 --> 1:21:21.642
<i>I'm really surprised at
everything my dad is saying,</i>

1:21:21.676 --> 1:21:23.844
<i>because he's always
been very quiet.</i>

1:21:23.879 --> 1:21:27.214
He's never expressed any of
his feelings, any of his emotions.

1:21:28.350 --> 1:21:30.751
<i>Um, so to finally hear him
open up,</i>

1:21:30.785 --> 1:21:34.855
shows me how much he also has
inside of him that he wants to express,

1:21:34.890 --> 1:21:38.259
<i>and I think talk to me about,
and it's amazing that he's</i>

1:21:38.293 --> 1:21:40.794
<i>this open and willing
to speak to me</i>

1:21:40.829 --> 1:21:44.098
and let his emotions out. That's
the part I needed to see I think.

1:21:46.234 --> 1:21:47.468
[speaking foreign language]

1:23:28.269 --> 1:23:31.405
<i>[narrator] Next time on 90
Day Fiance The Other Way...</i>

1:23:36.811 --> 1:23:38.245
Yeah, I did.

1:23:42.917 --> 1:23:44.218
[changes to foreign language]

1:23:45.453 --> 1:23:47.521
<i>Have you saw Victor's place?</i>

1:23:47.555 --> 1:23:50.424
Yeah, our little house
like survived.

1:23:50.458 --> 1:23:53.660
<i>I don't want to sound
insensitive but...</i>

1:23:53.695 --> 1:23:57.297
<i>the infidelity and stuff,
it's not over.</i>

1:23:57.331 --> 1:23:58.966
<i>Do you have that in your head?</i>

1:23:59.000 --> 1:24:02.202
I mean, honestly I didn't really
think about that till just now.

1:24:04.672 --> 1:24:06.140
[speaking foreign language]

1:24:19.721 --> 1:24:21.855
<i>[Taylor] I lived growing up
with gay dads.</i>

1:24:21.889 --> 1:24:23.757
Why is it so hard
to accept that?

1:24:23.792 --> 1:24:26.760
Mom's not happy, so
nobody is allowed to be happy.

1:24:26.795 --> 1:24:30.064
I guess,
screw your happiness, right?

1:24:30.098 --> 1:24:31.732
<i>[Jenny] At this point,
I think that his mother</i>

1:24:31.766 --> 1:24:35.202
would do almost anything she
can to get him away from me.

1:24:38.239 --> 1:24:40.908
I wanted to
tell you something but, I--

1:24:40.942 --> 1:24:43.143
It's hard for me
to talk about it.

1:24:51.453 --> 1:24:54.922
I'm sorry but I really
have to do this.
