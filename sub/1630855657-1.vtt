WEBVTT

00:13.230 --> 00:15.841
In an extraordinary
and unprecedented incident,

00:15.885 --> 00:18.409
a colossal Megalodon shark
was engaged

00:18.453 --> 00:22.631
in a dramatic battle with
a naval ship earlier today.

00:22.674 --> 00:25.025
The naval crew
was caught off guard,

00:25.068 --> 00:27.201
but they immediately
went into action.

00:27.244 --> 00:29.333
They swiftly deployed
their defense systems

00:29.377 --> 00:32.293
and activated
their antishark measures.

00:32.336 --> 00:33.990
The ship'’s cannons
roared to life

00:34.034 --> 00:35.644
as they unleashed
their firepower

00:35.687 --> 00:38.299
against the colossal creature.

00:38.342 --> 00:40.736
The Megalodon was
a force to be reckoned with.

00:40.779 --> 00:42.564
It demonstrated
its immense power

00:42.607 --> 00:45.306
by seeming impervious
to the ship'’s artillery,

00:45.349 --> 00:47.308
launching fierce attacks
on the vessel,

00:47.351 --> 00:50.050
causing considerable damage
to its hull.

00:53.705 --> 00:55.751
The naval crew had undergone
extensive training

00:55.794 --> 00:58.145
and managed
to minimize casualties.

00:58.188 --> 00:59.711
Despite the immense danger,

00:59.755 --> 01:01.583
their swift action
and quick thinking

01:01.626 --> 01:04.586
helped them navigate through
this life-or-death situation.

01:04.629 --> 01:07.893
However, theKing'’s crew
sustained multiple injuries

01:07.937 --> 01:10.766
and even fatalities
during the intense battle,

01:10.809 --> 01:12.811
including Captain Lynch
and Commander Moore,

01:12.855 --> 01:16.119
who sadly died when the shark
attacked his submarine.

02:16.875 --> 02:19.269
Tolbert, do we have eyes
on Commander Moore'’s sub?

02:19.313 --> 02:20.792
It'’s been taken apart, sir.

02:20.836 --> 02:22.838
That Meg tore it to shreds
just after Commander Moore

02:22.881 --> 02:24.231
hit it with a coup de grace.

02:24.274 --> 02:26.755
And Captain Lynch?

02:26.798 --> 02:28.844
We got visual confirmation
from the gunners, sir.

02:28.887 --> 02:30.672
Commander Moore and
Captain Lynch are dead.

02:30.715 --> 02:32.848
You'’re the commanding officer
now, sir.

02:35.067 --> 02:37.679
Okay, don'’t take anything
for granted, Tolbert.

02:37.722 --> 02:40.334
Keep your head on a swivel.
The ship'’s in bad shape.

02:40.377 --> 02:42.771
But the Megalodon
is on its last legs.

02:42.814 --> 02:44.338
It appears to be
continually bleeding,

02:44.381 --> 02:46.296
and its movements
have slowed considerably.

02:46.340 --> 02:48.080
You and the other Marines

02:48.124 --> 02:50.082
make good and sure
that shark is dead.

02:50.126 --> 02:52.084
We'’ve got to get her
back to shore.

02:52.128 --> 02:53.085
Aye, sir.

02:53.129 --> 02:54.261
I'’ll bring her in.

02:59.004 --> 03:00.136
Copy, sir.

03:08.231 --> 03:10.364
Crew of the USS King...

03:10.407 --> 03:13.193
this is Lieutenant Commander
Keith Sharp speaking.

03:13.236 --> 03:16.761
The Megalodon is dead,
but it comes at great cost.

03:16.805 --> 03:18.415
Captain Lynch
and Commander Moore

03:18.459 --> 03:20.591
have lost their lives
defending this crew.

03:20.635 --> 03:23.028
I am your new
commanding officer,

03:23.072 --> 03:24.552
and I'’m gonna do
everything I can

03:24.595 --> 03:27.250
to make sure we all
get back to shore safely.

03:27.294 --> 03:28.991
All able-bodied crew,

03:29.034 --> 03:31.428
please tend to the damage
on this ship right away.

03:36.041 --> 03:38.087
I'’m sending out
a distress beacon,

03:38.130 --> 03:40.568
and I'’m setting up
a course for the mainland.

03:40.611 --> 03:41.786
Semper fi!

03:41.830 --> 03:43.527
- Oo-rah!
- Oo-rah!

03:47.314 --> 03:48.967
Are you all right?

03:49.011 --> 03:50.926
Who cares?

03:50.969 --> 03:56.801
Jones, Tilkian,
Roberts, Captain Lynch...

03:57.889 --> 03:59.195
they'’re all dead.

03:59.239 --> 04:00.501
But so is that Meg.

04:00.544 --> 04:01.545
That'’s something, right?

04:16.299 --> 04:19.650
Hard to starboard!

04:19.694 --> 04:21.696
All hands, battle stations!

05:48.913 --> 05:50.654
Attention, crew.

05:50.698 --> 05:54.005
Will all engineers
please report to level B1?

06:01.491 --> 06:02.840
Wow.

06:14.417 --> 06:17.072
Welcome aboard the CRATUS,
Ms. London.

06:17.115 --> 06:18.160
Oh, um, Dr. Clark.

06:18.203 --> 06:19.509
You picked
an exciting first day.

06:19.553 --> 06:21.076
Oh, it'’s an honor to meet you.

06:21.119 --> 06:22.730
I'’m just--I'm such
a fan of your work.

06:22.773 --> 06:24.122
I'’ve read all of your research.

06:24.166 --> 06:27.299
Oh, thank you,
but I put my lab coat on

06:27.343 --> 06:29.432
one arm at a time
just like everyone else.

06:29.476 --> 06:30.955
And you can call me Riley.

06:30.999 --> 06:32.043
Thank you, Doctor--

06:32.087 --> 06:33.044
Ah!

06:33.088 --> 06:34.524
Riley.

06:34.568 --> 06:36.526
Don'’t forget,

06:36.570 --> 06:39.268
thousands of students
in science and engineering

06:39.311 --> 06:42.619
from around the world
wanted this gig,

06:42.663 --> 06:46.057
and your geothermal engineering
research came out on top.

06:46.101 --> 06:48.930
That means so much. Thank you.

06:48.973 --> 06:52.890
I'’m just--I'm so grateful
for this opportunity.

06:52.934 --> 06:55.502
You know, you'’ve been
a huge inspiration for me

06:55.545 --> 06:59.854
my whole career, with your
developing exploratory missions

06:59.897 --> 07:02.204
and heading this entire project.

07:02.247 --> 07:06.904
And when you started tapping
into geothermal energy

07:06.948 --> 07:09.951
to fuel this entire planet.

07:09.994 --> 07:11.387
Well, right now,

07:11.431 --> 07:13.607
we'’re at the beginning
of the beta testing,

07:13.650 --> 07:16.914
but as soon as we launch,
we'’re gonna be fully staffed.

07:16.958 --> 07:19.047
When CRATUS II
first went live two years ago,

07:19.090 --> 07:21.528
I knew I had to be
a part of this project.

07:21.571 --> 07:23.530
It'’s incredible
that you'’re not only

07:23.573 --> 07:26.054
studying deep-sea life
and biomes,

07:26.097 --> 07:27.751
but also tapping into

07:27.795 --> 07:30.711
a potentially limitless
source of natural energy.

07:31.799 --> 07:32.887
You want to take a look?

07:32.930 --> 07:35.019
Yeah.

07:35.063 --> 07:37.021
Is that Volcano 6
right beneath us?

07:37.065 --> 07:38.196
Yes, it is.

07:38.240 --> 07:40.285
It'’s been single-handedly

07:40.329 --> 07:43.506
supplying geothermal energy
to CRATUS II

07:43.550 --> 07:46.378
via a mail-well pipe,
believe it or not.

07:46.422 --> 07:48.424
Phases One through Three

07:48.468 --> 07:50.339
involved getting
the station operational

07:50.382 --> 07:52.907
from her original function
as an oil rig.

07:52.950 --> 07:55.692
Now we'’ve gone fully
beyond proof of concept,

07:55.736 --> 07:57.999
and we'’re
moving on to Phase Four.

07:58.042 --> 07:59.870
Is that part of Phase Four?

07:59.914 --> 08:01.002
Mm-hmm.

08:01.045 --> 08:03.700
That phase is CRATUS II.

08:03.744 --> 08:05.049
It'’s a fully operational

08:05.093 --> 08:07.356
energy harvester
and power plant.

08:07.399 --> 08:08.705
It'’s continually providing

08:08.749 --> 08:12.535
renewable and clean energy
from Volcano 6.

08:12.579 --> 08:14.232
Our goal is to have CRATUS II

08:14.276 --> 08:16.496
be fully operational
and independent.

08:16.539 --> 08:19.281
You know,
beyond the usual maintenance.

08:19.324 --> 08:22.545
And is it gonna be online today?

08:22.589 --> 08:25.156
Yes, it is.

08:25.200 --> 08:27.550
That'’s why
we brought you on board.

08:27.594 --> 08:30.335
We'’re gonna have you managing
the thermodynamic levels

08:30.379 --> 08:32.816
at the flip of a switch.

08:32.860 --> 08:33.904
Congratulations.

08:33.948 --> 08:35.558
Thanks so much.

08:35.602 --> 08:36.733
This way.

08:48.049 --> 08:50.355
Hey, Kurt. How'’s it going?

08:52.270 --> 08:53.968
Afternoon, Dr. Clark.

08:54.011 --> 08:55.578
Just putting
the finishing touches

08:55.622 --> 08:56.971
on this long-range remote

08:57.014 --> 08:59.234
that should work underwater
as you requested.

08:59.277 --> 09:00.365
Great.

09:00.409 --> 09:02.542
Now, what about
those floodgates?

09:02.585 --> 09:04.282
Well, that'’s up next.
I need a lot of juice

09:04.326 --> 09:05.893
to get those things
back up and running,

09:05.936 --> 09:08.852
so I'’ll be tackling that
once CRATUS II is online.

09:08.896 --> 09:10.854
Now, we can'’t operate
without those.

09:10.898 --> 09:12.073
Oh, I know.

09:13.161 --> 09:14.466
You must be Dr. London.

09:14.510 --> 09:18.862
It'’s just Ms. London,
um, or Kristy.

09:18.906 --> 09:21.125
I'’m not a doctor until
at least a year from now.

09:22.692 --> 09:24.738
Kurt Holt
is the most indispensable

09:24.781 --> 09:26.391
member of our team.

09:26.435 --> 09:27.392
You are.

09:27.436 --> 09:28.655
You take care of the station,

09:28.698 --> 09:30.004
you take care of us,

09:30.047 --> 09:33.181
and he has saved us
about a thousand times.

09:33.224 --> 09:34.748
She'’s being far too generous.

09:34.791 --> 09:36.880
She asks me to fix something,
I fix it. That'’s it.

09:36.924 --> 09:38.839
Well, it'’s great to meet you.

09:38.882 --> 09:41.276
Likewise.

09:41.319 --> 09:42.625
We ready to launch?

09:42.669 --> 09:44.061
Mmm, fully functional.

09:44.105 --> 09:46.107
Great.

09:46.150 --> 09:49.458
I am going to hand
Kristy over to you.

09:49.501 --> 09:52.679
I'’m gonna go finish up
on some preparations.

09:52.722 --> 09:54.637
I will see you guys in the sub.

09:54.681 --> 09:56.204
Copy that.

09:56.247 --> 09:57.248
Okay.

09:58.685 --> 09:59.903
All right.

10:06.170 --> 10:07.781
Yeah, Brunson has
the helm for the moment.

10:07.824 --> 10:10.479
Bring me up to speed
on the damage assessment.

10:10.522 --> 10:13.221
Flyover detected no further
threats in the water,

10:13.264 --> 10:16.137
so they signaled we'’re clear to
continue to our next rendezvous.

10:16.180 --> 10:18.095
Should be able
to get there in two hours.

10:18.139 --> 10:22.012
Okay, we can make do
on our own from now on.

10:22.056 --> 10:23.840
Sir, we'’re down
to a skeleton crew at best.

10:23.884 --> 10:25.407
The hull
has suffered some damage,

10:25.450 --> 10:27.322
but luckily, we'’re taking
no water at the moment.

10:27.365 --> 10:29.280
Copy that, Tolbert.

10:29.324 --> 10:31.326
Damn it. Anything else?

10:31.369 --> 10:33.633
Sir, engines took
some serious hits.

10:33.676 --> 10:36.897
We'’re currently operating
at about 70% power.

10:36.940 --> 10:39.464
Sonar and radar are kaput.

10:39.508 --> 10:41.684
Our large guns and
torpedoes are toast.

10:41.728 --> 10:43.512
The long-range radio
is acting haywire, too,

10:43.555 --> 10:45.296
but we'’re trying
to get it back online.

10:45.340 --> 10:46.428
What about fuel?

10:46.471 --> 10:47.951
We'’re at 50%,

10:47.995 --> 10:50.693
all within acceptable
parameters for our destination.

10:50.737 --> 10:53.130
Yeah, that should be enough
to get us back to the mainland.

10:54.523 --> 10:56.481
We gotta get
that engine fixed, guys, okay?

10:56.525 --> 10:58.092
At least near enough
where we can get

10:58.135 --> 10:59.746
ship-to-shore assistance.
You know what I'’m saying?

10:59.789 --> 11:02.139
Tolbert, you give that engine
a good once-over. You with me?

11:02.183 --> 11:04.054
Of course, sir.
I'’ll do what I can

11:04.098 --> 11:05.926
with the tools and supplies
we have available.

11:05.969 --> 11:07.754
Anything we can do
to get that engine moving

11:07.797 --> 11:10.147
even a little faster is gonna
help, you know what I'’m saying?

11:10.191 --> 11:12.280
Any breaches in the hull,
use a patch kit,

11:12.323 --> 11:13.847
seal it off, secure it.

11:13.890 --> 11:14.935
We'’ve gotta get
this ship to shore.

11:14.978 --> 11:15.936
You with me?

11:15.979 --> 11:16.980
Copy that, sir.

11:17.024 --> 11:17.938
Okay.

11:20.375 --> 11:21.942
Hoskins,
what about our munitions?

11:21.985 --> 11:24.858
Used up a whole lot of ammo
shooting at that damn Meg

11:24.901 --> 11:27.643
before it was finally
chopped up by the rotors.

11:27.687 --> 11:31.691
Short- and long-range rounds
are both depleted.

11:31.734 --> 11:34.955
Some of our depth charges
are completely unusable.

11:34.998 --> 11:37.871
We lost
fully half our total ammo.

11:37.914 --> 11:40.569
So we'’re at 50% there, too.

11:40.612 --> 11:42.571
The Kingis
entirely at half strength.

11:42.614 --> 11:44.181
That'’s about
the size of it, sir.

11:44.225 --> 11:46.009
Thank you for your work,
soldier.

11:46.053 --> 11:47.445
Are we all stowed
for the moment?

11:47.489 --> 11:50.405
- Yes, sir.
- Okay,

11:50.448 --> 11:52.494
Son, I want you
to take the first watch.

11:52.537 --> 11:54.104
You spot anything
moving in that water,

11:54.148 --> 11:56.237
you alert me
as fast as you can. Clear?

11:56.280 --> 11:57.760
- Crystal clear, sir.
- Get going.

11:57.804 --> 11:59.370
Hoskins...

11:59.414 --> 12:00.415
grab your rifle.

12:00.458 --> 12:01.851
We'’re not taking any chances.

12:09.816 --> 12:12.166
Dr. Clark, we have
confirmed that laser fusion

12:12.209 --> 12:14.908
will connect Volcano 6
to the CRATUS II station.

12:14.951 --> 12:16.910
Yeah. Uh, the submersible

12:16.953 --> 12:19.739
is outfitted
with a laser fusion cannon.

12:19.782 --> 12:21.741
This is gonna be
a very simple operation.

12:21.784 --> 12:24.091
I'’m gonna be in constant
contact with you and Kurt.

12:24.134 --> 12:25.745
Welcome to your first mission.

12:25.788 --> 12:27.224
Thank you so much.

12:27.268 --> 12:29.749
All of this, and you
can pilot a submersible?

12:29.792 --> 12:30.967
You'’re amazing.

12:31.011 --> 12:33.056
Not so amazing.

12:33.100 --> 12:34.623
I was brought up on the water.

12:34.666 --> 12:36.059
My father was an admiral.

12:36.103 --> 12:39.889
I just graduated from
a Sunfish to a submersible.

12:39.933 --> 12:41.804
I wanted to take the laser out,

12:41.848 --> 12:44.764
but she won the arm-wrestling
contest, so she

12:44.807 --> 12:46.896
gets to go take it out time.

12:46.940 --> 12:49.246
You can drive the submersible
another time.

12:49.290 --> 12:50.639
So you say.

12:51.858 --> 12:53.555
Okay, I think I'’m off.

12:53.598 --> 12:54.686
All right. Hey.

12:54.730 --> 12:56.253
We have live feed
in your cockpit,

12:56.297 --> 12:58.386
so anything you need, just ask.

12:58.429 --> 12:59.604
I know.

13:18.841 --> 13:20.495
Power on.

13:20.538 --> 13:21.975
Power at 100%.

13:23.150 --> 13:24.281
Oxygen on.

13:25.369 --> 13:27.763
Oxygen 100%.

13:27.807 --> 13:28.764
Lights on.

13:28.808 --> 13:30.722
Controls operational.

13:30.766 --> 13:33.116
Laser fusion drill
at full power.

13:33.160 --> 13:35.205
Prepare to dive on my mark.

13:35.249 --> 13:36.816
Copy that. Standing by.

13:43.692 --> 13:47.261
3, 2, 1...

13:47.304 --> 13:48.697
mark.

13:54.355 --> 13:55.791
Sub is away.

13:55.835 --> 13:57.488
We'’ll be at our location soon.

13:58.794 --> 14:00.230
Copy that.

14:00.274 --> 14:03.016
Everything'’s showing A-okay
on our end as well.

14:03.059 --> 14:05.018
Step one complete.

14:31.958 --> 14:34.699
Continuing descent.
Passing the reef now.

15:11.388 --> 15:16.437
Thermal vents are coming into
view now. Just about there.

15:29.015 --> 15:30.538
Sub is in position.

15:30.581 --> 15:31.974
Preparing laser fusion drill

15:32.018 --> 15:34.934
to provide link between
Volcano 6 and CRATUS II.

15:38.981 --> 15:40.722
CRATUS II is in standby mode.

15:41.810 --> 15:43.812
Ready to receive direct energy.

15:51.776 --> 15:53.822
Drill is at full power.

15:53.865 --> 15:55.955
Initiating drilling sequence.

15:55.998 --> 15:58.740
This is just incredible.

15:58.783 --> 16:00.176
I was just sitting

16:00.220 --> 16:02.570
in Advanced Geothermal Systems
class last week,

16:02.613 --> 16:05.225
and now I get to see it
all in action.

16:06.400 --> 16:10.012
Well, wait '’til they see this.

16:10.056 --> 16:11.144
All right, Doc...

16:11.187 --> 16:12.319
slow and steady.

16:12.362 --> 16:13.320
I know, I know.

16:13.363 --> 16:14.799
I want to get this right.

16:14.843 --> 16:17.280
I don'’t want to have
to go back to square one.

16:17.324 --> 16:19.195
Fusion drill'’s powered on.

16:19.239 --> 16:20.718
Initiating dig.

16:26.333 --> 16:28.770
And we are at 1/2 kilometer.

16:30.554 --> 16:32.904
We are at 2 kilometers.

16:35.429 --> 16:36.691
2 1/2 kilometers.

16:38.345 --> 16:39.433
Kurt, what'’s going on?

16:41.826 --> 16:43.480
Uh, I-I can'’t get it to link.

16:43.524 --> 16:45.004
Running diagnostics now.

16:46.788 --> 16:49.051
3 1/2 kilometers. Kurt.

16:52.185 --> 16:54.361
We'’re approaching
a depth of 4 kilometers.

16:54.404 --> 16:56.450
CRATUS II is still offline.

16:56.493 --> 16:57.929
We should have
already diverted

16:57.973 --> 17:00.454
to geothermal direct energy
by now.

17:03.152 --> 17:06.068
Find anything you can about
syncing to the energy source.

17:06.112 --> 17:07.026
Got it.

17:09.550 --> 17:11.639
Our scans are showing
abundant reserves of energy

17:11.682 --> 17:13.032
between one
and three kilometers

17:13.075 --> 17:16.035
Nothing unusual on our end.
Over.

17:16.078 --> 17:17.862
Keep looking.

17:17.906 --> 17:20.430
Um...

17:20.474 --> 17:23.433
try running a scan
.5 kilometers out.

17:23.477 --> 17:25.131
There must be
something we'’re missing.

17:27.524 --> 17:30.005
We'’re at 4 1/2 kilometers.

17:30.049 --> 17:31.528
We'’re at 5 kilometers.

17:31.572 --> 17:32.573
Contact!

17:39.971 --> 17:41.016
There it is.

17:42.104 --> 17:43.888
But we may have opened

17:43.932 --> 17:46.978
a sizable fissure
in the ocean floor,

17:47.022 --> 17:50.808
about 250,
300 meters in length.

17:50.852 --> 17:54.551
There'’s no volcanic or
geothermal activity down there,

17:54.595 --> 17:56.858
but let'’s keep
an eye on it, okay?

17:56.901 --> 17:58.773
Copy that.

17:58.816 --> 18:00.644
Running assessments on
the underlying superstructure

18:00.688 --> 18:02.559
and the possible
range of volcanoes.

18:06.433 --> 18:08.304
Um...

18:08.348 --> 18:10.045
Dr. Clark? We'’ve lost visual.

18:10.089 --> 18:11.177
Come in.

18:11.220 --> 18:12.482
Kurt?

18:15.094 --> 18:16.834
Hey, Kurt. Kristy?

18:16.878 --> 18:18.097
Is everything okay?

18:19.185 --> 18:20.708
It should be.

18:20.751 --> 18:24.059
Might have just lost juice
due to the extra drilling.

18:24.103 --> 18:26.322
I'’ll get her back.

18:26.366 --> 18:28.237
Kurt, Kristy, can you hear me?

18:30.196 --> 18:31.197
What'’s that?

18:34.983 --> 18:37.159
Sonar is showing a huge blip,

18:37.203 --> 18:39.727
but there shouldn'’t be anything
down there of that size.

18:44.210 --> 18:45.602
Dr. Clark,
if you can hear me,

18:45.646 --> 18:46.951
there'’s something there,
something big.

18:48.214 --> 18:49.650
Could just be interference,

18:49.693 --> 18:52.305
but whatever it is,
it'’s headed your direction.

18:52.348 --> 18:53.828
Over.

18:55.612 --> 18:57.527
Kurt, Kristy, can you hear me?

18:59.050 --> 19:00.356
Do you hear me?

19:08.234 --> 19:10.192
Oh! I think comms are back!

19:10.236 --> 19:12.281
-Dr. Clark?
- Kurt!

19:12.325 --> 19:14.240
Did you see that?

19:14.283 --> 19:17.547
Dr. Clark, did you
see something down there?

19:17.591 --> 19:19.897
Based on its movements
and its speed,

19:19.941 --> 19:21.725
I-I would think it was a shark.

19:21.769 --> 19:23.205
It'’s agitated.

19:23.249 --> 19:25.338
The drill must have
disturbed its habitat?

19:25.381 --> 19:27.470
Oh.

19:27.514 --> 19:30.734
But you did an environmental
impact study weeks ago.

19:30.778 --> 19:32.214
There should be
no large animals

19:32.258 --> 19:33.389
of that size down there.

19:33.433 --> 19:35.870
Riley, get back to CRATUS now.

19:40.048 --> 19:41.658
Kurt, what is this thing?!

19:46.446 --> 19:47.838
Kristy, what do you see?

19:47.882 --> 19:49.579
We see it on the scanner,

19:49.623 --> 19:51.320
and it'’s still
right behind you!

19:51.364 --> 19:53.235
You have to try and lose it!

19:55.585 --> 19:59.372
This thing is huge!
Much more than a hundred feet!

19:59.415 --> 20:01.417
Get back to CRATUS A.S.A.P.

20:01.461 --> 20:03.114
I can'’t shake it.

20:03.158 --> 20:06.030
All right,
give me a second to think!

20:06.074 --> 20:08.294
Whatever it is, do it fast!

20:08.337 --> 20:10.644
Um, try using
your drill'’s laser.

20:10.687 --> 20:12.298
Maybe you can
at least disorient it

20:12.341 --> 20:14.735
and get a chance to get away.

20:14.778 --> 20:17.433
Worth a shot.
Here goes nothing!

20:22.525 --> 20:23.700
Dr. Clark?

20:23.744 --> 20:25.180
Can you read me? Dr. Clark?

20:25.224 --> 20:26.747
I'’m here. I--

20:26.790 --> 20:29.010
I think I hit it
with the laser,

20:29.053 --> 20:30.533
but I can'’t be sure.

20:30.577 --> 20:32.622
I think it'’s still out there.

20:32.666 --> 20:35.234
You should be able
to see it on the sonar.

20:35.277 --> 20:37.540
Let'’s see. Um...

20:37.584 --> 20:39.847
our scanners say
that it'’s disappeared,

20:39.890 --> 20:42.676
but just try to get up here,

20:42.719 --> 20:46.027
and w-we'’ll hopefully
be able to recover CRATUS II.

20:46.070 --> 20:48.247
Checking CRATUS II status.

20:48.290 --> 20:50.031
CRATUS II is offline.

20:52.120 --> 20:53.948
We'’re confirming that
on our end as well.

20:53.991 --> 20:55.732
I'’m so sorry.

20:57.952 --> 20:59.519
I'’m resurfacing.

20:59.562 --> 21:00.737
We'’ll have to figure out

21:00.781 --> 21:02.435
how to get
that station back online,

21:02.478 --> 21:04.567
but keep your eye
on that radar.

21:04.611 --> 21:06.656
That thing is still out there.

21:06.700 --> 21:08.658
I never want to see it again.

21:19.016 --> 21:22.106
Over 100 feet.
That'’s a blue whale.

21:22.150 --> 21:23.717
They'’re saying
it'’s far too aggressive.

21:23.760 --> 21:27.155
All right, well,
let'’s head toward the island.

21:28.287 --> 21:30.332
Roger.

21:30.376 --> 21:33.248
Looks totally clear. You?

21:33.292 --> 21:34.249
Nothing on the sonar.

21:40.211 --> 21:42.475
Copy. Let'’s head up the coast.

21:42.518 --> 21:44.694
Last sighting was just
near San Diego.

21:54.704 --> 21:55.879
Dr. Clark, are you okay?

21:55.923 --> 21:57.490
We can get you
a medic or anything.

21:57.533 --> 21:59.274
Oh! Oh, I'’m fine. I'm fine.

21:59.318 --> 22:00.928
Good call on that laser drill.

22:03.887 --> 22:05.933
- Kurt.
- Yeah?

22:05.976 --> 22:08.501
Can we get Dr. Hilton
up here, like, now?

22:08.544 --> 22:10.329
You got it.
I'’m glad you're okay.

22:10.372 --> 22:11.678
Thanks.

22:14.985 --> 22:16.857
So what did
the instruments say?

22:16.900 --> 22:18.946
Well, according to the sonar,

22:18.989 --> 22:22.471
the object was approximately
187 feet in length,

22:22.515 --> 22:24.299
and it was fast.

22:24.343 --> 22:27.041
It never slowed or stopped.

22:27.084 --> 22:30.392
Whatever it was,
it was relentless.

22:30.436 --> 22:33.134
Just as you made contact
with the CRATUS II,

22:33.177 --> 22:34.918
a blip showed up on the screen.

22:34.962 --> 22:36.050
Huge.

22:36.093 --> 22:37.747
Just out of nowhere
on top of you.

22:37.791 --> 22:39.793
We confirmed with sonar.

22:39.836 --> 22:42.404
According to Kurt,
it'’s never been wrong before.

22:43.492 --> 22:45.451
200 feet?

22:45.494 --> 22:48.062
What kind of shark
is 200 feet long?

22:48.105 --> 22:49.803
Dr. Clark...

22:49.846 --> 22:52.414
Kurt just told me
you saw a shark.

22:52.458 --> 22:53.415
Yeah.

22:53.459 --> 22:55.461
- At depth?
- Yeah.

22:55.504 --> 22:57.767
Well, I guess
that'’s not entirely uncommon

22:57.811 --> 22:59.421
to be seen
in these waters, so...

23:00.770 --> 23:03.120
Look, I know it sounds strange,

23:03.164 --> 23:05.427
but I'’ve never
seen anything this--

23:05.471 --> 23:07.908
It was enormous.

23:07.951 --> 23:10.476
We did an environmental
impact study, okay?

23:11.955 --> 23:14.088
It did not show
a single animal

23:14.131 --> 23:16.090
in this zone of that size

23:16.133 --> 23:18.135
or any of the zones
that surround it.

23:19.354 --> 23:21.312
How big did you say
the shark was?

23:21.356 --> 23:24.054
It was approximately 187 feet.

23:24.098 --> 23:26.187
The blip was huge.
We both saw it.

23:26.230 --> 23:27.754
Wait.

23:27.797 --> 23:29.451
Earlier this morning,

23:29.495 --> 23:31.453
there was a daily briefing
from the Coast Guard

23:31.497 --> 23:34.804
saying that there was
a huge shark attack at sea.

23:34.848 --> 23:37.372
No, they called it
abnormally large.

23:37.416 --> 23:39.809
But if that first one'’s
already dead, then...

23:39.853 --> 23:41.071
Look,

23:41.115 --> 23:42.551
the largest great white
ever recorded

23:42.595 --> 23:44.248
is just over 20 feet long.

23:44.292 --> 23:47.295
Now, I think what you
probably saw is a blue whale,

23:47.338 --> 23:49.253
and at that depth,
it would make much more sense

23:49.297 --> 23:50.690
for it to be a filter feeder.

23:50.733 --> 23:54.476
And even so,
a blue whale is half the size

23:54.520 --> 23:56.870
of the reading you'’re claiming
to have seen on sonar.

23:56.913 --> 23:58.480
I know what I saw.

23:58.524 --> 24:00.961
It was in my face.

24:01.004 --> 24:02.005
Okay?

24:02.049 --> 24:04.181
It came right at me.

24:04.225 --> 24:06.836
This was not a blue whale.

24:06.880 --> 24:08.490
I didn'’t see baleen.

24:08.534 --> 24:10.840
I saw thousands
of razor-sharp teeth.

24:10.884 --> 24:11.841
It was a shark.

24:11.885 --> 24:13.364
The only shark

24:13.408 --> 24:15.497
that'’s the same size
as a blue whale

24:15.541 --> 24:16.846
is the OtodusMegalodon,

24:16.890 --> 24:18.674
and all of our research
suggests

24:18.718 --> 24:21.808
that that was extinct
3 1/2 million years ago.

24:21.851 --> 24:23.462
This thing came right at me

24:23.505 --> 24:25.855
and tried to take
a bite out of the sub.

24:25.899 --> 24:29.337
I nearly crashed the craft
trying to evade it.

24:31.557 --> 24:33.559
What about the CRATUS II?

24:33.602 --> 24:37.519
Well, we'’re recharging
the drill as we speak.

24:37.563 --> 24:38.738
It'’s gonna take a few hours,

24:38.781 --> 24:40.348
but once
it'’s back up and running,

24:40.391 --> 24:42.393
we'’ll take another stab
at CRATUS II.

24:42.437 --> 24:44.657
If there is a Megalodon
under that fissure,

24:44.700 --> 24:47.921
it'’s gonna cause
major implications to bio,

24:47.964 --> 24:51.490
both micro and macro.

24:53.100 --> 24:56.843
There could be
an entire ecosystem down there,

24:56.886 --> 24:59.323
and we just unleashed it.

24:59.367 --> 25:02.413
Anything of that size

25:02.457 --> 25:06.766
presents an immediate threat
to this station, CRATUS II,

25:06.809 --> 25:08.898
the well pipe
that serves Volcano 6.

25:08.942 --> 25:11.118
Look, we gotta figure out
a way to track that thing,

25:11.161 --> 25:12.946
make sure it doesn'’t come back.

25:12.989 --> 25:14.861
We gotta plug that hole up
from wherever it came from,

25:14.904 --> 25:16.558
'’cause if there's
more of them--

25:16.602 --> 25:18.908
But the only equipment
we have is the laser drill.

25:18.952 --> 25:20.562
It'’s still charging up.

25:20.606 --> 25:22.738
It'’s not gonna
serve our purposes.

25:22.782 --> 25:24.348
The only thing that we
have in front of us

25:24.392 --> 25:26.525
is to close those floodgates.

25:28.265 --> 25:30.180
We'’ve got to protect this team.

25:31.312 --> 25:32.966
All right. I'’m on it.

25:33.009 --> 25:34.445
Follow me.

25:44.586 --> 25:45.979
Captain!

25:46.022 --> 25:49.330
I see a large object
heading on a westerly course,

25:49.373 --> 25:50.897
heading directly towards us.

25:50.940 --> 25:52.899
Fin in the water!

25:52.942 --> 25:54.814
You seein'’ what we're seeing
from the bow, Captain?

25:54.857 --> 25:56.642
That shark was dead.

25:58.600 --> 26:01.603
I got a visual
on another Megalodon fin!

26:01.647 --> 26:02.865
Get ready, Marines.

26:02.909 --> 26:04.954
Big guns are down,
so it'’s on us.

26:04.998 --> 26:07.478
Improvise, adapt,
and overcome.

26:07.522 --> 26:09.698
Hold a steady course, Brunson.

26:09.742 --> 26:12.179
I don'’t want to have reason
to panic unless we need one.

26:12.222 --> 26:13.615
Aye, sir. Loud and clear.

26:13.659 --> 26:16.400
Crew! Do not fire
'’til I give the order.

26:16.444 --> 26:18.228
I don'’t want us wasting ammo.

26:18.272 --> 26:19.621
Copy that.

26:19.665 --> 26:20.883
- Oo-rah!
- Oo-rah!

26:20.927 --> 26:22.581
Eyes up, Marines!

26:22.624 --> 26:24.147
All hands!

26:32.068 --> 26:34.027
All right,
diverting energy now.

26:34.070 --> 26:36.246
I'’ll let you know when there's
enough energy to flood them.

26:36.290 --> 26:37.813
We'’ve got sonar here, too,

26:37.857 --> 26:41.643
but we'’ve also got Rig
Perimeter Tracking Software.

26:41.687 --> 26:43.166
If there'’s anything
in the water of that size

26:43.210 --> 26:45.604
in the area, this will find it.

26:49.085 --> 26:51.479
If this thing is really...

26:51.522 --> 26:53.786
200 feet long...

26:53.829 --> 26:55.222
it'’ll show up here.

26:55.265 --> 26:58.617
Just let me dial it in
around the CRATUS station.

26:58.660 --> 27:01.663
So what do we do
if we detect it?

27:01.707 --> 27:03.404
Well, we get it
away from our equipment.

27:03.447 --> 27:04.971
We can'’t afford any setbacks.

27:05.014 --> 27:07.626
How? I may be
a marine biologist,

27:07.669 --> 27:09.279
but I don'’t exactly
have any equipment

27:09.323 --> 27:11.934
to secure a 200-foot Megalodon.

27:11.978 --> 27:14.284
Then we'’ll figure
something out.

27:14.328 --> 27:16.591
We'’re not gonna let it
destroy our research

27:16.635 --> 27:17.679
or hurt somebody.

27:18.767 --> 27:20.290
Can you widen the range?

27:21.509 --> 27:23.946
Sure. No problem.

27:28.559 --> 27:31.040
Three-mile radius.

27:31.084 --> 27:32.433
Still nothing.

27:32.476 --> 27:34.391
Well, maybe it swam away.

27:34.435 --> 27:37.264
But where could it have gone?
We just saw it.

27:37.307 --> 27:38.744
All right,
if this is a Megalodon,

27:38.787 --> 27:40.659
they can swim
up to five meters a second,

27:40.702 --> 27:42.051
and at that massive size,

27:42.095 --> 27:44.967
they can cover a lot
of ground very quickly.

27:45.011 --> 27:48.318
It'’s vital to the survival
of our local ecosystems

27:48.362 --> 27:50.016
that we find this thing
as soon as possible.

27:50.059 --> 27:51.713
And, uh--

27:51.757 --> 27:53.933
Hey, if this is real,

27:53.976 --> 27:56.239
I guess I'’d like
to see it for myself.

27:57.327 --> 27:58.502
You know...

27:58.546 --> 28:00.679
morbid curiosity.

28:00.722 --> 28:02.463
Trust me.

28:02.506 --> 28:03.986
You don'’t.

28:06.815 --> 28:08.687
Hoskins! You have eyes on it?

28:08.730 --> 28:09.818
It'’s back below, sir!

28:09.862 --> 28:11.690
Depth charges port side! Now!

28:11.733 --> 28:12.647
Aye, sir.

28:23.876 --> 28:25.834
Hurt it with both charges!

28:25.878 --> 28:27.488
- Hurt it bad!
- But it sure isn'’t dead.

28:27.531 --> 28:29.708
We nearly emptied our entire
arsenal on the last one.

28:29.751 --> 28:30.883
Stay ready.

28:30.926 --> 28:33.799
Captain, we need backup
in a bad way.

28:33.842 --> 28:36.236
Ammo is low,
getting lower by the second.

28:36.279 --> 28:37.977
Coast Guard and Navy
everywhere near us

28:38.020 --> 28:39.805
are getting
distress calls from civilians.

28:39.848 --> 28:42.285
They need assistance and evac.

28:42.329 --> 28:43.722
They will aid us
when they can,

28:43.765 --> 28:46.202
but unarmed civilians
take priority, Marines.

28:46.246 --> 28:47.421
- You got me?
- Copy that.

28:47.464 --> 28:49.162
Okay, give me sit-rep.
Are we whole?

28:49.205 --> 28:52.121
Negative. It'’s got a few of us.

28:52.165 --> 28:54.689
Richardson, Smith,
and Jacobs by my count.

28:54.733 --> 28:57.431
Dented up the port side
pretty bad, too.

28:57.474 --> 28:59.694
Can'’t repair that
until we find shore.

28:59.738 --> 29:02.741
Sir, that was the last one
of our depth charges.

29:02.784 --> 29:04.438
But it looked
like it did the trick,

29:04.481 --> 29:05.744
at least for now, sir.

29:05.787 --> 29:07.267
Well, hopefully
it'’ll be enough to--

29:07.310 --> 29:09.051
that they'’ll think twice
about coming back for us.

29:09.095 --> 29:11.532
That sucker was even bigger
than the last one.

29:11.575 --> 29:13.752
It was like, what, 200 feet?

29:13.795 --> 29:15.928
Ship is 600 feet.

29:15.971 --> 29:18.234
Damn thing was
easily a third of the size.

29:18.278 --> 29:19.670
Well, the smaller one
killed most of us.

29:19.714 --> 29:21.629
I'’m gonna try
to send out another S.O.S.

29:21.672 --> 29:22.935
I need the two of you

29:22.978 --> 29:25.154
to keep your eyes glued
to that damn water!

29:25.198 --> 29:26.808
You so much as glimpse
that damn thing,

29:26.852 --> 29:28.723
- you let everybody know. Clear?
- Yes, sir!

29:28.767 --> 29:30.246
'’Cause if it
decides to come back

29:30.290 --> 29:33.249
and we'’re not ready,
we are all dead, pal. Go!

30:15.552 --> 30:16.945
Officer on deck!

30:16.989 --> 30:19.774
Come on, man. You know
that'’s not me anymore.

30:19.818 --> 30:22.646
Whatever you say, sir.

30:22.690 --> 30:25.258
You know, they have me
captaining the USS Libertynow.

30:27.390 --> 30:30.437
No, I'’m just here
for the day.

30:30.480 --> 30:32.831
Glad to have you back,
Captain.

30:32.874 --> 30:33.832
It'’s good to be back.

30:38.140 --> 30:40.012
This is Lieutenant
Commander Keith Sharp

30:40.055 --> 30:41.274
of the USSKing

30:41.317 --> 30:43.406
on a heading for Jalisco.

30:43.450 --> 30:44.886
We'’ve been damaged
by a pair of attacks

30:44.930 --> 30:46.888
and are in desperate need
of assistance.

30:46.932 --> 30:49.021
Huge shark in the water.

30:49.064 --> 30:51.588
It'’s already attacked us.

30:51.632 --> 30:55.070
Repeat,
in need of reinforcements.

30:55.114 --> 30:57.681
If anyone in the area
hears me, respond.

30:57.725 --> 30:58.682
Over.

30:58.726 --> 31:00.249
I repeat...

31:00.293 --> 31:01.555
this is the USS King...

31:02.686 --> 31:03.949
with an S.O.S. going out

31:03.992 --> 31:05.559
to all available bands.

31:05.602 --> 31:09.084
If anyone reads me,
please respond. Over.

31:10.651 --> 31:13.567
This is
Captain Kasey Keele, uh,

31:13.610 --> 31:16.135
captain of the USSFragasso.
We read you.

31:17.310 --> 31:19.051
We'’re about 100 miles out,

31:19.094 --> 31:22.576
and we'’ll go ahead and reroute
to intercept you. Over.

31:24.230 --> 31:25.709
Thank you, Fragasso.

31:25.753 --> 31:27.276
You don'’t know
how grateful we are. Over.

31:27.320 --> 31:29.365
Just hang tight.
Keep your heading.

31:29.409 --> 31:31.802
We'’ll go ahead and reroute
to intercept you. Over.

31:31.846 --> 31:33.326
Copy that,Fragasso.

31:33.369 --> 31:35.589
We'’ll see you shortly. Over.

32:21.635 --> 32:22.984
Oh, God, shark!

32:23.028 --> 32:24.507
No, no!

32:33.038 --> 32:34.865
Is there anything
on sonar yet?

32:35.954 --> 32:37.172
Still nothing.

32:39.000 --> 32:40.349
Oh, my gosh.

32:40.393 --> 32:41.829
You have to look at this.

32:41.872 --> 32:42.961
What is it, Kristy?

32:44.440 --> 32:46.181
Oh my God,
that'’s Puerto Vallarta.

32:46.225 --> 32:48.967
That'’s 3,000 miles from here.

32:51.970 --> 32:52.971
That'’s enormous.

32:54.233 --> 32:55.712
But that'’s not the 200 feet

32:55.756 --> 32:58.628
that Dr. Clark
confirmed on sonar.

32:58.672 --> 33:00.152
There'’s more of them.

33:00.195 --> 33:01.805
There must be.

33:02.937 --> 33:04.460
Even though Megalodons are fast,

33:04.504 --> 33:06.114
there'’s no way
that one could have traveled

33:06.158 --> 33:07.507
that distance in that time.

33:07.550 --> 33:08.856
We have to warn them.

33:13.078 --> 33:15.080
Look!

33:15.123 --> 33:17.517
This one'’s
not 200 feet or 95.

33:17.560 --> 33:19.475
It'’s--It's in the middle.

33:21.608 --> 33:22.696
There'’s more than two.

33:23.827 --> 33:25.133
I'’ll go below deck,

33:25.177 --> 33:27.005
shut the floodgates.

33:27.048 --> 33:28.441
Maybe we can block '’em out.

33:28.484 --> 33:30.834
We need to get eyes on it.
Let'’s do it.

33:36.884 --> 33:38.842
It was south-southwest.

33:41.062 --> 33:43.847
Eyes up, people. On alert.

33:45.371 --> 33:46.850
Fin in the water!

33:50.985 --> 33:52.378
Oh, my.

33:52.421 --> 33:54.597
It'’s remarkable.

33:54.641 --> 33:57.165
The only way to stop this
is to observe it.

33:57.209 --> 33:59.776
We need to know
what we'’re dealing with.

33:59.820 --> 34:02.910
Everyone be on alert
and away from the water.

34:02.953 --> 34:04.999
Kurt, it'’s Riley. Come in.

34:05.043 --> 34:07.306
How are we coming
on those floodgates? Over.

34:07.349 --> 34:09.308
Just give me
two more minutes, Doctor.

34:09.351 --> 34:11.832
As soon as you can,
we need them.

34:11.875 --> 34:13.921
60 seconds at most. Over.

34:13.964 --> 34:15.096
Copy that.

34:15.140 --> 34:17.533
I think it'’s trying to assess

34:17.577 --> 34:20.275
whether the station
is a threat or not.

34:20.319 --> 34:23.409
What an intelligent creature.

34:23.452 --> 34:26.194
Basically, there'’s a direct
line of seismic disturbance

34:26.238 --> 34:29.241
from the CRATUS
to the ocean floor.

34:29.284 --> 34:30.677
And these volcanoes,

34:30.720 --> 34:33.506
we'’ve got to hope
that those volcanoes

34:33.549 --> 34:35.377
are not in the way
of this Megalodon.

34:35.421 --> 34:36.335
Watch out!

34:45.257 --> 34:46.562
Kurt, come in!

34:46.606 --> 34:48.564
Are you okay?

34:48.608 --> 34:49.783
Did we take a hit?

34:49.826 --> 34:51.045
Is there damage?

34:51.089 --> 34:52.786
Everybody to the upper decks!

34:52.829 --> 34:54.788
Get up safely! Now!

35:05.668 --> 35:07.192
Down on the lower decks now.

35:10.630 --> 35:12.022
Activated floodgates.

35:12.066 --> 35:13.415
Again.

35:13.459 --> 35:14.764
Kurt, it'’s coming back!

35:14.808 --> 35:16.462
It'’s gonna hit
the station again!

35:16.505 --> 35:17.767
Gates are going down soon.

35:17.811 --> 35:19.595
That should protect us
against another hit.

35:19.639 --> 35:21.336
Wait! Wait!

35:21.380 --> 35:22.642
Stop the gate!

35:22.685 --> 35:24.644
Doctor, what?

35:24.687 --> 35:26.167
Just for a second.

35:26.211 --> 35:28.909
No. That'’s
what'’s protecting us.

35:28.952 --> 35:31.172
Hilton, the floodgates go

35:31.216 --> 35:32.956
clear down to
the drill site, correct?

35:33.000 --> 35:34.784
Yes, correct. It'’s a precaution

35:34.828 --> 35:37.352
in case there'’s an energy bleed
or any contamination.

35:37.396 --> 35:40.660
If it gets trapped in
the floodgate containment area,

35:40.703 --> 35:42.618
we could buy a little time

35:42.662 --> 35:45.055
to learn how to deal
with these Megalodons.

35:45.099 --> 35:48.537
No, no. That will
put us in extreme danger.

35:48.581 --> 35:51.149
That thing could tear down
this entire station

35:51.192 --> 35:52.411
and us with it.

35:52.454 --> 35:54.543
We need to observe it.

35:54.587 --> 35:59.200
But having that thing
trapped with us is terrifying.

35:59.244 --> 36:03.117
You all saw what that Megalodon
did in Puerto Vallarta.

36:03.161 --> 36:06.599
If it'’s allowed to swim free,
kill, destroy...

36:06.642 --> 36:08.992
Yes, we'’re scared now,

36:09.036 --> 36:14.998
but how are we gonna feel
if it destroys more human life?

36:15.042 --> 36:17.740
We don'’t want
to have to live with that.

36:17.784 --> 36:21.048
As much as I hate the idea
of trapping it in with us,

36:21.091 --> 36:22.963
you'’re right.
And I'’d be remiss to say

36:23.006 --> 36:25.400
that it'’d be
my life'’s greatest work

36:25.444 --> 36:27.707
to study a real Megalodon
up close.

36:27.750 --> 36:29.970
We can figure out
how to stop it.

36:30.013 --> 36:32.233
Fine. Let'’s trap it, then.

36:32.277 --> 36:34.235
But how are we gonna
hold it long enough

36:34.279 --> 36:36.106
to make sure
it doesn'’t escape?

36:36.150 --> 36:38.152
We only have one shot at this.

36:38.196 --> 36:39.893
No...

36:39.936 --> 36:42.983
but the sharks are drawn
to electromagnetic energy.

36:43.026 --> 36:44.593
It'’s how they stalk their prey.

36:44.637 --> 36:47.466
If we could electrify
something below the surface

36:47.509 --> 36:50.643
with enough magnetism,
we could draw it in.

36:50.686 --> 36:54.081
Basalt. It'’s a molten rock.
that'’s magnetic.

36:54.124 --> 36:55.735
And considering
there is a volcano

36:55.778 --> 36:58.955
literally directly beneath us,

36:58.999 --> 37:00.522
I would bet
that the ocean floor

37:00.566 --> 37:01.697
is covered with it,

37:01.741 --> 37:03.221
and it'’s conductive.

37:03.264 --> 37:05.832
We can use that
to make the Megalodon

37:05.875 --> 37:07.355
think there'’s food down there.

37:07.399 --> 37:09.052
Kurt, come in.

37:09.096 --> 37:12.969
I need for you to electrify
the ocean floor around us.

37:13.013 --> 37:15.668
We'’re drawing the Megalodon in.

37:15.711 --> 37:17.626
If I disconnect the mini-sub,

37:17.670 --> 37:19.149
drop the power cord
to the ocean floor,

37:19.193 --> 37:22.022
that should give us
a small magnetic pulse.

37:22.065 --> 37:23.328
And I mean small.

37:23.371 --> 37:25.373
That'’s ingenious.

37:25.417 --> 37:26.635
Anything will do.

37:26.679 --> 37:29.203
And it has to happen now,
Kurt, now.

37:29.247 --> 37:30.248
Copy that.

37:32.032 --> 37:35.078
Look at that incredible size.

37:35.122 --> 37:37.080
Kurt, now!

37:49.484 --> 37:51.181
All right.
Megalodon is captured.

37:51.225 --> 37:53.967
He isn'’t happy
about it, though.

37:54.010 --> 37:57.666
Okay, I think this Megalodon'’s
about 120 feet long.

37:57.710 --> 38:01.366
We can assume it'’s strong,
obviously,

38:01.409 --> 38:02.976
but is it strong enough

38:03.019 --> 38:05.152
to dislodge
the CRATUS II entirely?

38:05.195 --> 38:06.806
I don'’t think so.

38:06.849 --> 38:10.766
We'’ve got a deep and extremely
heavy subsurface anchor.

38:10.810 --> 38:14.335
It'’s got a seismic four rating.

38:14.379 --> 38:15.945
These hits to the floodgates

38:15.989 --> 38:19.122
shouldn'’t cause
any significant damage.

38:19.166 --> 38:21.473
Okay, well,
we have it locked in here,

38:21.516 --> 38:23.344
but how do we get out?

38:23.388 --> 38:25.346
It'’s not like
we can take the mini-sub.

38:28.610 --> 38:30.264
The well pipe.

38:31.744 --> 38:33.702
I can'’t believe
I haven'’t considered this.

38:33.746 --> 38:37.053
I don'’t think the Megalodon
could critically damage it.

38:37.097 --> 38:40.143
It goes several kilometers deep.

38:40.187 --> 38:42.320
Yes. However,
the energy is flowing

38:42.363 --> 38:44.060
through the well pipe
unregulated now

38:44.104 --> 38:45.366
due to the drill today.

38:45.410 --> 38:47.586
And it'’s building up
seismic pressure.

38:47.629 --> 38:49.849
If that pressure
gets built up enough,

38:49.892 --> 38:52.852
it could feed back
in both directions,

38:52.895 --> 38:55.028
to the CRATUS and
to the bottom of the well pipe.

38:55.071 --> 38:56.986
That could be devastating.

38:59.162 --> 39:02.905
That pressure builds the well
to critical mass,

39:02.949 --> 39:04.951
it could unleash
a seismic blast

39:04.994 --> 39:06.909
right along the fault line.

39:06.953 --> 39:10.435
What happens if the well pipe
unleashes a seismic blast?

39:10.478 --> 39:12.959
Well, the worst...

39:13.002 --> 39:16.049
the very worst,

39:16.092 --> 39:18.399
is that it could create
a tsunami.

39:21.620 --> 39:23.361
We'’re gonna
have to call for help.

39:24.449 --> 39:25.363
Right.

39:29.410 --> 39:31.934
We'’ve been out here
for a while. Still nothing.

39:39.072 --> 39:42.684
Hold. Hold.
I have a visual, 10 o'’clock.

39:42.728 --> 39:44.991
It'’s big, huge!

39:45.034 --> 39:46.775
Those are blues.
See the spouts?

39:54.479 --> 39:57.525
I'’m telling you,
it was probably these whales.

40:06.882 --> 40:08.144
Eyes up, Brunson.

40:08.188 --> 40:10.059
Can'’t risk
another blindsided attack.

40:11.626 --> 40:12.932
This is an S.O.S.

40:12.975 --> 40:14.716
Does anyone copy?

40:14.760 --> 40:17.589
Again. This is an S.O.S.

40:17.632 --> 40:19.155
A coast station will answer.

40:19.199 --> 40:20.983
They have priority,

40:21.027 --> 40:23.508
and we don'’t have the ability
to handle a distress call.

40:23.551 --> 40:25.510
This is the CRATUS station.

40:25.553 --> 40:28.034
We'’re a high-security
drilling platform.

40:28.077 --> 40:30.428
We'’ve just captured
a Megalodon shark.

40:30.471 --> 40:32.081
We need assistance.

40:34.736 --> 40:36.608
This is the USS King.

40:36.651 --> 40:38.523
Copy your distress call,
CRATUS.

40:38.566 --> 40:41.134
Did you say
you trapped a Megalodon?

40:41.177 --> 40:44.790
Look, I know it sounds insane,
but we--we'’ve--

40:44.833 --> 40:46.835
Not at all, CRATUS.

40:46.879 --> 40:48.663
We'’ve been dealing with that
same enemy for a while now.

40:48.707 --> 40:50.273
Okay, give us
your coordinates.

40:50.317 --> 40:53.407
I'’ve just enabled a beacon
with our location.

40:53.451 --> 40:54.887
We'’ve been attacked
and damaged

40:54.930 --> 40:57.063
by a nearly
100-foot Megalodon,

40:57.106 --> 40:58.499
and we previously spotted

40:58.543 --> 41:00.762
another 200-foot one
in the area.

41:00.806 --> 41:02.982
The 100-footer is contained,

41:03.025 --> 41:04.592
but there is a possibility

41:04.636 --> 41:07.029
that it could cause
damage to our equipment,

41:07.073 --> 41:10.598
which could result in disaster
for the Hawaiian island.

41:10.642 --> 41:11.686
Are you sure?

41:11.730 --> 41:13.601
Yes. We need
military assistance

41:13.645 --> 41:15.124
as soon as possible.

41:15.168 --> 41:16.604
We cannot eliminate

41:16.648 --> 41:18.867
the threat of these Megalodons
on our own.

41:18.911 --> 41:21.174
We have a well pipe
in a volcano.

41:21.217 --> 41:23.350
If it'’s dismantled,
it could trigger a tsunami

41:23.393 --> 41:26.135
that could hit
the main island of Hawaii.

41:26.179 --> 41:28.311
Okay, we'’re receiving
your signal, CRATUS.

41:28.355 --> 41:29.704
We'’re the only ship
remotely close

41:29.748 --> 41:31.532
to your coordinates
at this time,

41:31.576 --> 41:33.273
so we'’re gonna head
straight for you.

41:33.316 --> 41:34.361
Help is on the way.

41:39.801 --> 41:41.760
Ooh, look at you.

41:41.803 --> 41:43.805
Oh, no, baby. You'’re a big boy.

41:43.849 --> 41:45.546
Who'’s a big monster.

41:45.590 --> 41:47.679
Come on, big monster. Run.

41:47.722 --> 41:49.158
Run. There.

41:50.638 --> 41:51.987
Yeah.

41:52.031 --> 41:53.032
Oh, my goodness.

41:53.075 --> 41:53.989
Come here.

41:59.429 --> 42:00.430
Come on, Shaggy.

42:03.999 --> 42:05.914
Over here! Over here!

42:05.958 --> 42:07.916
Come on. Hey!

42:07.960 --> 42:09.788
Come to Mama!

42:09.831 --> 42:11.354
Big monster.
Oh, my goodness.

42:11.398 --> 42:12.704
You'’re a big monster.

42:12.747 --> 42:14.836
Come on. Let'’s go. Let's go.

42:14.880 --> 42:15.881
Come to Mommy.

42:36.902 --> 42:38.599
USS Fragasso,come in.

42:38.643 --> 42:41.080
This is USS King.Over.

42:42.168 --> 42:43.517
This is the USS Fragasso.

42:43.561 --> 42:44.866
We read you.

42:44.910 --> 42:47.434
We are still
en route for rescue. Over.

42:47.477 --> 42:49.001
Change of plans, Fragasso.

42:49.044 --> 42:50.306
Are you able to route

42:50.350 --> 42:52.570
to the CRATUS
drilling site A.S.A.P.?

42:52.613 --> 42:54.093
They'’ve been attacked by

42:54.136 --> 42:56.138
and have trapped a Megalodon
at the location.

42:58.663 --> 43:00.795
The CRATUS is midway
between you and us.

43:00.839 --> 43:03.145
We'’d be happy to meet you
in the middle. Over.

43:03.189 --> 43:05.060
Much obliged,Fragasso.

43:05.104 --> 43:06.845
I'’ll put you through to them.

43:06.888 --> 43:08.324
You'’re likely
to beat us there,

43:08.368 --> 43:09.935
so they can update you
on the latest, okay?

43:09.978 --> 43:11.545
Over and out.

43:19.031 --> 43:22.991
There'’s been another attack
in Oceanside, California.

43:23.035 --> 43:26.691
That'’s 1,500 miles
from Puerto Vallarta.

43:26.734 --> 43:29.650
How many Megalodons
are out there?

43:29.694 --> 43:32.697
CRATUS, this is
the USS Fragasso.

43:32.740 --> 43:35.525
We'’ve been informed
of your distress beacon. Over.

43:35.569 --> 43:39.268
Uh, this is Dr. Riley Clark
with the CRATUS.

43:39.312 --> 43:40.792
Who am I speaking with?

43:40.835 --> 43:42.489
This is Captain Kasey Keele.

43:42.532 --> 43:45.013
TheKing has updated us
on your situation.

43:45.057 --> 43:48.060
Can you tell us
what'’s going on?

43:48.103 --> 43:52.064
Uh, the Navy fought one of
these Megalodons this morning.

43:52.107 --> 43:54.370
W-We'’re seeing a few.

43:54.414 --> 43:56.634
There are several reports
of attacks

43:56.677 --> 43:59.375
on the west coast
of California and Mexico.

43:59.419 --> 44:02.988
There was just
another one in Oceanside.

44:03.031 --> 44:05.294
We'’re aware, and, uh,
we'’ve just been informed

44:05.338 --> 44:07.470
by the Mexican
and U.S. government

44:07.514 --> 44:08.515
that there'’s been
a shelter in place

44:08.558 --> 44:10.256
for their entire west coast.

44:10.299 --> 44:12.214
Hawaii, Alaska, Canada.

44:13.433 --> 44:14.782
We also wanted to inform you

44:14.826 --> 44:16.566
that both of us
are en route to you,

44:16.610 --> 44:18.046
but we make it to you first,

44:18.090 --> 44:20.005
since the Kingwas
pretty severely damaged

44:20.048 --> 44:22.007
in their Megalodon attacks.
Over.

44:22.050 --> 44:24.357
Captain, if that'’s the case,
I think the King

44:24.400 --> 44:27.360
may be in more dire straits
than us for the moment.

44:27.403 --> 44:30.189
Don'’t worry, Dr. Clark.
Civilians always

44:30.232 --> 44:32.060
take precedence
in these situations.

44:32.104 --> 44:34.628
We'’re about to reroute
at theKing'’s request.

44:34.672 --> 44:36.456
We'’ll go ahead and
rendezvous at your location.

44:40.416 --> 44:42.331
Dr. Clark, the, uh, Coast Guard

44:42.375 --> 44:44.899
is getting people
out of the water as we speak.

44:44.943 --> 44:46.727
Is your location secure?

44:46.771 --> 44:49.512
All are currently safe,
Fragasso.

44:49.556 --> 44:50.731
Currently.

44:50.775 --> 44:52.254
But we'’ve got
a Megalodon trapped

44:52.298 --> 44:55.257
directly beneath our station,
inside our flood walls.

44:55.301 --> 44:57.782
We'’re dealing with
some prototype technology

44:57.825 --> 45:00.567
used to harvest the geothermal
energy of volcanoes.

45:00.610 --> 45:02.743
What are you doing?
That'’s confidential information.

45:02.787 --> 45:04.136
It'’s the military.

45:04.179 --> 45:06.878
They need to know the full
severity of the situation.

45:06.921 --> 45:09.315
Dr. Clark, you still there?

45:10.795 --> 45:14.276
Fragasso,this is Dr. Hilton.

45:14.320 --> 45:17.453
There could be a tsunami
threat heading for Hawaii.

45:17.497 --> 45:19.978
The Megalodon near CRATUS
is contained,

45:20.021 --> 45:22.545
but we have a well pipe
to the volcano that,

45:22.589 --> 45:24.983
if dismantled,
could trigger a tsunami

45:25.026 --> 45:26.201
if the shark hits it.

45:26.245 --> 45:27.637
Over.

45:27.681 --> 45:28.900
Thank you
for giving us a heads-up

45:28.943 --> 45:30.815
on what we
could be going through.

45:30.858 --> 45:33.252
We'’ll go ahead and alert
the Hawaiian Coast Guard.

45:33.295 --> 45:34.949
We'’re about 15 minutes out.

45:34.993 --> 45:37.386
Alert us
if your situation deteriorates.

45:37.430 --> 45:39.214
And I shouldn'’t
have to tell you this,

45:39.258 --> 45:41.521
but keep your people
out of the water. Over.

45:44.437 --> 45:45.743
We will.

45:45.786 --> 45:47.005
Thank you, Captain Keele.

45:47.048 --> 45:48.267
Thank you so much.

45:48.310 --> 45:51.096
Over and out.

45:51.139 --> 45:53.533
- That attack in Oceanside?
- Yeah?

45:53.576 --> 45:55.796
A shark just showed up
out of nowhere

45:55.840 --> 45:57.755
and killed a dozen people

45:57.798 --> 45:59.234
and then went back
into the deep sea,

45:59.278 --> 46:01.541
didn'’t stay in the shallows.

46:01.584 --> 46:03.673
I wonder
why it didn'’t stick around.

46:55.160 --> 46:57.118
Oh. Wait a minute.

46:58.206 --> 47:00.078
Hello? Hello?

47:00.121 --> 47:01.079
Yes!

47:01.122 --> 47:03.777
Helmut, no, we'’re okay.

47:03.821 --> 47:06.301
We--Okay.

47:07.389 --> 47:09.565
Okay. We understand.

47:09.609 --> 47:10.610
Got it.

47:13.265 --> 47:16.355
That was the CEO
of Quasar Fusion.

47:16.398 --> 47:19.401
The company that funded
the rest of your research.

47:19.445 --> 47:21.099
You'’ve done your homework.

47:21.142 --> 47:22.361
Yes, I have.

47:24.798 --> 47:27.845
Well, Quasar said they'’re
working with local authorities

47:27.888 --> 47:30.848
and the Coast Guard
to keep the area clear,

47:30.891 --> 47:32.588
like the Fragassosaid.

47:32.632 --> 47:34.286
But the Fragassoand the King

47:34.329 --> 47:37.332
are the only rescue ships out
in the area that can reach us,

47:37.376 --> 47:40.727
and they said we might need
to get that well pipe offline

47:40.770 --> 47:42.642
as soon as we can.

47:42.685 --> 47:43.643
And I agree.

47:43.686 --> 47:45.514
That tsunami cannot happen.

47:45.558 --> 47:47.516
Well, the only way
for that to happen

47:47.560 --> 47:48.866
is if a massive force

47:48.909 --> 47:51.129
were to just
run into the well pipe.

47:51.172 --> 47:52.434
But we'’ve stress tested it

47:52.478 --> 47:55.176
against anything
that we can come across.

47:55.220 --> 47:57.613
But we'’ve never
come across a Megalodon.

47:57.657 --> 48:01.791
Even so, a Megalodon
weighs 30 to 65 metric tons.

48:02.880 --> 48:04.011
We can handle that.

48:04.055 --> 48:06.840
We just have to hope
that no more show up.

48:06.884 --> 48:09.538
Right.

48:09.582 --> 48:12.802
We should disconnect
the well pipe just to be safe.

48:12.846 --> 48:16.197
But without CRATUS II
being currently operational,

48:16.241 --> 48:17.503
we, uh...

48:17.546 --> 48:21.159
we would have
to take it offline manually.

48:21.202 --> 48:23.988
I hate to say that, but it
seems like quite the oversight.

48:24.031 --> 48:25.641
Yeah.

48:25.685 --> 48:26.686
Well, when this
was constructed,

48:26.729 --> 48:28.079
we didn'’t compensate

48:28.122 --> 48:31.386
for prehistoric sharks
roaming the area.

48:31.430 --> 48:32.692
So how do we do that?

48:32.735 --> 48:35.303
Just take the pipe offline?

48:35.347 --> 48:39.133
Well, there is a shut-off line,
but it'’s underwater.

48:41.527 --> 48:44.051
You'’d have to get in the water
with those Megalodons?

48:44.095 --> 48:46.575
Someone would have to, yes.

48:48.708 --> 48:51.624
Well, let me lift
the floodgates, release the Meg.

48:51.667 --> 48:54.888
So we'’re gonna
release it out there

48:54.932 --> 48:56.934
so it can do more damage?

48:56.977 --> 48:59.414
That'’s the reason we trapped it
in the first place.

48:59.458 --> 49:01.764
We know the Megalodon
has done damage

49:01.808 --> 49:04.506
to at least
one military vessel.

49:04.550 --> 49:09.772
The sheer size
of the Kingor the Fragasso

49:09.816 --> 49:11.949
would send the Megalodon

49:11.992 --> 49:14.168
racing towards it
like a homing missile.

49:14.212 --> 49:15.430
So that'’s our choice.

49:15.474 --> 49:17.476
We keep it in here with us

49:17.519 --> 49:19.957
when we have to take
the well pump offline,

49:20.000 --> 49:22.002
or release it
into the open water,

49:22.046 --> 49:25.440
where it'’s guaranteed to
create more carnage and death.

49:25.484 --> 49:26.789
Great choice.

49:33.535 --> 49:35.233
We'’re still
en route to the CRATUS.

49:35.276 --> 49:38.192
Are you sure you'’re
still up to assist? Over.

49:38.236 --> 49:40.629
Captain Keele,
we'’re still en route,

49:40.673 --> 49:43.545
and it'’s still our duty
to protect those who need us.

49:43.589 --> 49:45.069
Shouldn'’t be too long now.

49:45.112 --> 49:46.374
Over.

49:47.941 --> 49:50.465
Captain, we have a sighting
off the starboard bow.

49:50.509 --> 49:53.077
We may have
our eyes on something.

49:53.120 --> 49:55.688
I'’ll catch you up after
we assess. Over and out.

49:56.994 --> 49:58.082
Over and out.

50:05.959 --> 50:07.178
We spotted it.

50:07.221 --> 50:10.268
Changed directions
to come for us

50:10.311 --> 50:12.792
Been stalking us
for the last minute or so.

50:17.884 --> 50:19.190
What'’s the call, Captain?

50:21.409 --> 50:22.715
We'’re not going to wait

50:22.758 --> 50:25.500
for that damn shark
to make the first move.

50:25.544 --> 50:28.851
Helmsman! I want you
to take us right at that thing,

50:28.895 --> 50:30.288
full speed.

50:30.331 --> 50:31.724
The instant we'’re in range,

50:31.767 --> 50:33.769
I want you
to light that sucker up.

50:35.075 --> 50:36.294
Prepare torpedoes!

50:36.337 --> 50:37.295
Prepare torpedoes!

50:43.127 --> 50:44.824
Prepare
a second torpedo barrage!

50:48.393 --> 50:50.003
Damn it.

50:50.047 --> 50:52.571
It'’s taken
the torpedoes offline.

50:52.614 --> 50:53.659
Where did it go?

50:55.400 --> 50:57.271
It'’s directly under us.

50:57.315 --> 50:58.968
Eyes all around!

51:05.714 --> 51:07.325
The engines are offline.

51:11.155 --> 51:13.200
Captain! Captain!

51:18.510 --> 51:21.121
This is the USS Fragasso.

51:21.165 --> 51:22.992
Come in, Captain Sharp.

51:23.036 --> 51:24.516
Come in! Over!

51:24.559 --> 51:25.821
Captain Keele, what are you--

51:25.865 --> 51:27.432
Ran into the Megalodon shark!

51:27.475 --> 51:28.955
It'’s destroying us.

51:32.089 --> 51:33.133
I'’m coming to you.

51:33.177 --> 51:35.092
Stand your ground!
Keep fighting!

51:35.135 --> 51:36.528
Negative!

51:36.571 --> 51:39.270
You'’ve got to get
to those civilians!

51:39.313 --> 51:41.141
We'’ll hold out
as long as we can.

51:41.185 --> 51:42.664
Give them help, Sharp!

51:42.708 --> 51:44.884
Work with those scientists
on the CRATUS.

51:44.927 --> 51:47.104
Find a way to take them out.

51:47.147 --> 51:49.106
This is Captain Keele...

51:49.149 --> 51:50.542
over and out.

51:58.637 --> 52:00.029
The Fragasso'’sgone, sir?

52:01.553 --> 52:02.945
Yeah, get us
to that station, Brunson,

52:02.989 --> 52:04.425
any way you can.

52:04.469 --> 52:06.775
We'’re the only ones who
can save that rig right now.

52:06.819 --> 52:10.344
Aye, sir.

52:10.388 --> 52:13.304
So I did a little digging,

52:13.347 --> 52:15.349
and it turns out that,

52:15.393 --> 52:16.785
according to the Navy
and Coast Guard,

52:16.829 --> 52:18.526
these aren'’t
the first encounters

52:18.570 --> 52:20.528
with Megalodons
in recent times.

52:20.572 --> 52:24.750
There have been
at least two others on record.

52:24.793 --> 52:27.535
The first instance
was actually close to Hawaii.

52:27.579 --> 52:29.972
The USS Shawdiscovered
a Russian submarine crew

52:30.016 --> 52:33.106
that was trying to break into
the underwater cable system,

52:33.150 --> 52:38.546
and, in doing so, they
released the first Megalodon.

52:38.590 --> 52:40.766
Captain Streeper
and Commander Lynch,

52:40.809 --> 52:42.289
along with Admiral King,

52:42.333 --> 52:45.162
managed to subdue the Russians
and kill the Megalodon,

52:45.205 --> 52:47.076
but not before the Admiral

52:47.120 --> 52:48.991
and many of their crew
gave their lives.

52:50.732 --> 52:53.779
The second incident
involved the USS King.

52:53.822 --> 52:57.130
I wonder if it'’s the same ship
that'’s headed here.

52:57.174 --> 52:58.392
According to reports,

52:58.436 --> 53:00.089
Commander Moore
and a Captain Lynch

53:00.133 --> 53:03.180
managed to take another one out
that had appeared

53:03.223 --> 53:05.747
after they intercepted
some Chinese Navy ships.

53:05.791 --> 53:07.358
I suppose it'’s a good sign

53:07.401 --> 53:09.055
that they can help
with our shark problem.

53:09.098 --> 53:12.232
But... before they get here,
though, I think we have

53:12.276 --> 53:14.756
a once-in-a-lifetime
opportunity here.

53:17.411 --> 53:21.154
The opportunity to examine
a real live Megalodon up close.

53:24.549 --> 53:28.944
It'’s a terrifying dream
come true.

53:28.988 --> 53:32.252
Well, our Megalodon is
trapped in here with us,

53:32.296 --> 53:34.080
and she'’s pretty pissed off.

53:34.123 --> 53:36.256
If that rage
continues to build up,

53:36.300 --> 53:38.519
she could take a run
at the well pipe,

53:38.563 --> 53:40.217
creating a tsunami,

53:40.260 --> 53:44.090
which is the very last thing
we could possibly need.

53:44.133 --> 53:46.919
We don'’t know
how far away the Fragassois.

53:46.962 --> 53:48.834
We'’re gonna have to come up
with a backup plan.

53:48.877 --> 53:50.923
Well, what kind of plan?

53:50.966 --> 53:52.446
Well, we know there have been

53:52.490 --> 53:54.448
at least three to four
Megalodon sightings

53:54.492 --> 53:56.407
within the vicinity of our dig.

53:57.973 --> 54:02.326
Multiple Megalodons,
all different sizes,

54:02.369 --> 54:05.546
causing incredible damage
over a massive area.

54:07.374 --> 54:08.636
It could be hunting.

54:12.771 --> 54:14.512
This station,
it'’s been open for two years,

54:14.555 --> 54:18.951
and this crater was excavated
more than five years ago,

54:18.994 --> 54:21.693
so why now?

54:30.092 --> 54:32.312
What are the two things
that every predator,

54:32.356 --> 54:33.792
especially oceanic predator,

54:33.835 --> 54:36.055
is particularly
interested in protecting

54:36.098 --> 54:37.274
more than anything?

54:39.363 --> 54:41.278
Their hunting grounds...

54:42.496 --> 54:43.758
and...

54:44.846 --> 54:46.544
And what?

54:46.587 --> 54:48.110
Their breeding grounds.

54:53.159 --> 54:54.595
The blood spotting
in the water,

54:54.639 --> 54:56.684
I thought at first
that it was just

54:56.728 --> 54:59.600
some stray gore
from a kill or--or an injury,

54:59.644 --> 55:02.124
but...

55:02.168 --> 55:04.692
it'’s in keeping
with Selachimorpha labor.

55:04.736 --> 55:06.433
This Megalodon...

55:08.392 --> 55:10.350
is pregnant.

55:10.394 --> 55:12.918
It'’s spawning?

55:12.961 --> 55:14.528
Well, no wonder
they'’re so aggressive.

55:14.572 --> 55:17.749
They see everything
as a threat to their offspring.

55:20.969 --> 55:24.625
We'’re positioned directly over
an underground volcano system.

55:24.669 --> 55:26.410
It'’s some
of the warmest waters

55:26.453 --> 55:27.889
in all of the Pacific Ocean.

55:27.933 --> 55:30.196
We have an abundance
of sea life,

55:30.239 --> 55:32.546
rich in flora and fauna,

55:32.590 --> 55:36.855
and it'’s all being cultivated
by the CRATUS and...

55:36.898 --> 55:38.160
the area surrounding it.

55:39.901 --> 55:42.469
It'’s within reason
that we may have

55:42.513 --> 55:45.124
been creating
the perfect spawning ground.

55:47.561 --> 55:50.390
And the Megalodons
have come here to give birth.

55:52.566 --> 55:54.002
Well, we'’re closed in with one,

55:54.046 --> 55:56.265
and she'’s pissed.

55:56.309 --> 55:57.397
These Megalodon sightings,
they--

55:57.441 --> 56:00.052
they may have been
a combination

56:00.095 --> 56:01.880
of females coming to breed

56:01.923 --> 56:06.275
and males
protecting their young.

56:08.452 --> 56:10.367
So the males
are protecting the perimeter,

56:10.410 --> 56:11.759
looking for predators.

56:13.413 --> 56:14.675
To a Megalodon,

56:14.719 --> 56:18.026
a Navy ship definitely
looks like a predator.

56:18.070 --> 56:19.767
Dr. Hilton,
how confident are you

56:19.811 --> 56:21.552
that this is
actually happening?

56:23.205 --> 56:24.990
Well, um,

56:26.600 --> 56:28.472
judging by the Megalodons'’

56:28.515 --> 56:32.214
increasingly aggressive
behavior, I can say...

56:33.651 --> 56:36.088
without reasonable doubt,
that, uh...

56:37.742 --> 56:41.920
that is a pregnant Megalodon.

56:41.963 --> 56:43.661
Well, how many pups
can a Megalodon have

56:43.704 --> 56:45.314
in its gestation period?

56:47.186 --> 56:49.623
Sharks can spawn up to two

56:49.667 --> 56:51.886
if they don'’t eat each other
in the womb.

56:51.930 --> 56:55.803
And some species
can have as many as 100.

56:55.847 --> 56:58.676
But we--we don'’t
know that much about...

57:00.504 --> 57:02.157
Megalodon reproduction.

57:03.855 --> 57:05.422
The only fossils
we have on record

57:05.465 --> 57:08.250
are those of their teeth.

57:08.294 --> 57:11.340
So what you'’re saying is
we could be closed in here

57:11.384 --> 57:13.430
with three of these things

57:13.473 --> 57:15.693
and the possibility
of dozens of pups?

57:15.736 --> 57:18.043
And if they become
hungry or agitated...

57:19.697 --> 57:22.351
they'’re coming
after the CRATUS.

57:22.395 --> 57:23.788
The well pipe, as well.

57:23.831 --> 57:26.965
Then we have to go down
and shut down that valve.

57:27.008 --> 57:28.227
And we'’ve got to get rid

57:28.270 --> 57:30.621
of as many of them
as we possibly can

57:30.664 --> 57:32.927
for our safety
and everyone else'’s.

57:32.971 --> 57:36.583
What would happen
if the females

57:36.627 --> 57:40.326
were perceived as being
under threat by the males?

57:40.369 --> 57:42.633
Well, the males, they would
become very territorial

57:42.676 --> 57:44.722
a-and try to protect them.

57:44.765 --> 57:46.375
What if we were able

57:46.419 --> 57:49.378
to draw away
the male Megalodons,

57:49.422 --> 57:52.294
somehow bring them
under the CRATUS,

57:52.338 --> 57:55.080
set off a controlled explosion,

57:55.123 --> 57:57.996
taking them out, the station...

57:58.039 --> 57:59.476
And all of us as well.

57:59.519 --> 58:01.129
Yeah, we--

58:01.173 --> 58:04.219
we can'’t just go off
killing this species.

58:04.263 --> 58:05.960
They--They were previously
thought to be extinct.

58:06.004 --> 58:08.180
We need to study them.

58:08.223 --> 58:10.791
They'’re not your friends, okay?

58:10.835 --> 58:14.316
We'’ve got to find a way
to protect our crew,

58:14.360 --> 58:16.231
protect our team.

58:16.275 --> 58:17.885
That is job one.

58:17.929 --> 58:19.496
Are we clear?

58:19.539 --> 58:22.324
Yes, crystal...

58:22.368 --> 58:23.761
Dr. Clark.

58:23.804 --> 58:25.850
The USS King
should lure the males

58:25.893 --> 58:30.158
into this region
in protective mode, okay?

58:30.202 --> 58:32.030
We can use the ship and the sub

58:32.073 --> 58:35.163
to try to move them
out of range of the explosion.

58:35.207 --> 58:37.165
No--What about the well?

58:37.209 --> 58:40.386
We cannot set off
any explosions

58:40.429 --> 58:43.911
until this well is turned off.

58:43.955 --> 58:45.739
Unless we want
to create a tsunami

58:45.783 --> 58:47.436
in the middle
of all this chaos.

58:47.480 --> 58:49.395
One of us will have
to take the mini-sub

58:49.438 --> 58:50.570
down to the well,

58:50.614 --> 58:52.790
decouple the well pipe

58:52.833 --> 58:55.227
from the rest of the equipment.

58:55.270 --> 58:56.533
But we need to get to work

58:56.576 --> 58:58.491
unless the Marines
are on their way.

58:58.535 --> 59:00.319
Apparently there
are now sightings

59:00.362 --> 59:01.929
as far down
as Puerto Vallarta.

59:01.973 --> 59:03.409
And not blue whales,

59:03.452 --> 59:04.932
but 200-foot
prehistoric sharks.

59:12.070 --> 59:13.898
Unbelievable.

59:22.994 --> 59:26.084
Wait, 11 o'’clock!
Do you see it?!

59:26.127 --> 59:30.436
My God, that has to be it.

59:30.479 --> 59:32.220
Dopping for a better look.

59:36.616 --> 59:38.792
All right, men.
Let'’s keep the ship steady.

59:38.836 --> 59:42.100
I'’m gonna take one last sweep
before we arrive, all right?

59:42.143 --> 59:43.841
Aye, sir.

59:43.884 --> 59:45.451
How are we feeling, Marines?

59:45.494 --> 59:47.018
Hanging in there, Cap.

59:47.061 --> 59:48.976
We'’re still leaking oil
pretty steady out the back,

59:49.020 --> 59:50.499
and we'’re down
to our last clips of ammo.

59:50.543 --> 59:51.631
But we'’re staying frosty, sir.

59:51.675 --> 59:53.154
Staying frosty.

59:53.198 --> 59:54.678
That'’s what I like to hear.

59:54.721 --> 59:56.680
Go on, man. Show him.

59:56.723 --> 59:58.029
I'’ve been working on something.

59:58.072 --> 59:59.117
Show me.

59:59.160 --> 01:00:00.379
During my stint in the Gulf,

01:00:00.422 --> 01:00:01.772
I picked up a few tricks.

01:00:01.815 --> 01:00:03.861
IEDs, like frag bombs.

01:00:03.904 --> 01:00:05.253
Something like that.

01:00:05.297 --> 01:00:06.994
A bit more powerful
than your average IED.

01:00:07.038 --> 01:00:08.648
The lightweight materials
give you

01:00:08.692 --> 01:00:10.563
the ability
to give them some distance.

01:00:10.607 --> 01:00:12.391
You wouldn'’t want to get caught
in this thing'’s blast radius.

01:00:12.434 --> 01:00:13.958
You would not.

01:00:14.001 --> 01:00:15.612
The best I could do
under the circumstance.

01:00:15.655 --> 01:00:16.917
Don'’t be modest, man.

01:00:16.961 --> 01:00:18.310
These bad boys are beautiful.

01:00:18.353 --> 01:00:20.138
Loaded with spare screws,

01:00:20.181 --> 01:00:21.661
ball bearings, nuts, washers,

01:00:21.705 --> 01:00:24.011
and some other pointy bits
I found in the toolbox.

01:00:24.055 --> 01:00:25.796
I figured we don'’t need
the stuff to fix the ship with

01:00:25.839 --> 01:00:27.841
- at this point.
- You figured right.

01:00:27.885 --> 01:00:29.582
I noticed our bullets didn'’t
do a whole lot of damage.

01:00:29.626 --> 01:00:31.932
but maybe if we could punch
some messier holes in it...

01:00:31.976 --> 01:00:33.630
You did a damn fine job,
Tolbert.

01:00:33.673 --> 01:00:34.631
We'’re gonna use those.

01:00:34.674 --> 01:00:37.024
But be smart. Pick your spots.

01:00:37.068 --> 01:00:38.678
- Will do, Captain.
- All right, now listen up.

01:00:38.722 --> 01:00:40.854
We get to the station,
we gotta move fast.

01:00:40.898 --> 01:00:42.160
If we don'’t move fast--

01:00:42.203 --> 01:00:43.422
Ho! They'’re back!

01:00:43.465 --> 01:00:44.771
Stations!

01:00:51.865 --> 01:00:54.085
Tolbert, stand by
with those frags.

01:00:54.128 --> 01:00:55.913
Don'’t toss one 'til
you'’re sure you can hit it.

01:00:55.956 --> 01:00:56.914
Yes, sir.

01:00:56.957 --> 01:00:58.350
Okay, aim.

01:00:58.393 --> 01:00:59.525
Steady. Steady.

01:00:59.568 --> 01:01:00.482
Fire!

01:01:22.809 --> 01:01:25.725
Tolbert, stay ready
to toss that other one.

01:01:25.769 --> 01:01:27.335
You see that thing?!

01:01:27.379 --> 01:01:28.685
Negative!

01:01:28.728 --> 01:01:29.990
Nothing to port!

01:01:38.782 --> 01:01:40.131
Now, Tolbert!

01:01:45.223 --> 01:01:46.311
Eyes?

01:01:46.354 --> 01:01:47.312
Negative!

01:01:47.355 --> 01:01:48.574
Anyone have eyes on it?

01:01:48.617 --> 01:01:49.706
Negative!

01:01:49.749 --> 01:01:51.577
Fore and aft!

01:01:51.620 --> 01:01:53.144
See if you can spot it!

01:01:53.187 --> 01:01:54.972
Everyone okay?!

01:01:55.015 --> 01:01:57.148
We'’re fine.
We'’re taking on water, Brunson.

01:01:57.191 --> 01:01:58.497
Engine'’s offline, Cap!

01:01:58.540 --> 01:02:00.151
Can we fix it?

01:02:00.194 --> 01:02:02.370
I'’ll get on it now,
but it will take some time.

01:02:02.414 --> 01:02:05.722
We still got a few miles
to go before CRATUS.

01:02:05.765 --> 01:02:07.767
Brunson, check the engine!

01:02:07.811 --> 01:02:10.727
Tolbert, Hoskins, keep all eyes
available on the water.

01:02:10.770 --> 01:02:12.990
If this thing turns back
for us, we'’re in trouble.

01:02:14.556 --> 01:02:16.341
Yeah.

01:02:17.821 --> 01:02:20.084
CRATUS, this is the USS King.

01:02:20.127 --> 01:02:22.347
Our engine'’s been hit.
We'’re dead in the water.

01:02:22.390 --> 01:02:24.262
But we'’re working
to get it up and running now.

01:02:24.305 --> 01:02:25.916
Last we saw, it was
heading right for you,

01:02:25.959 --> 01:02:28.788
so be on the lookout
for a 200-foot Megalodon.

01:02:28.832 --> 01:02:31.225
We'’re going to be to you
as soon as we can. Over.

01:02:31.269 --> 01:02:32.879
Stand by, Captain.

01:02:32.923 --> 01:02:34.838
We'’ve got plan B. Over.

01:02:34.881 --> 01:02:36.187
I'’m all ears.

01:02:36.230 --> 01:02:38.493
We'’re gonna take
our well pipe offline.

01:02:38.537 --> 01:02:40.887
Then we'’re gonna
blow these things to hell.

01:02:40.931 --> 01:02:42.759
Good deal.

01:02:45.065 --> 01:02:47.372
Okay, everyone,
we'’ve got a plan.

01:02:47.415 --> 01:02:48.852
We'’re gonna do it like this.

01:02:48.895 --> 01:02:51.680
Everyone else has been
evacuated via helicopter,

01:02:51.724 --> 01:02:52.899
so it'’s up to us
to finish this.

01:02:54.945 --> 01:02:59.688
One, I'’m gonna be taking
the well pipe offline, okay?

01:02:59.732 --> 01:03:02.996
Two, we'’re gonna get
some remote explosives.

01:03:03.040 --> 01:03:04.955
We'’re gonna line
the bottom of CRATUS II.

01:03:04.998 --> 01:03:09.873
Three, we raise the floodgates
to lure the Megalodons in.

01:03:09.916 --> 01:03:13.180
Four, we get
out of the range in the sub.

01:03:13.224 --> 01:03:15.226
Five, we use
the remote detonator

01:03:15.269 --> 01:03:16.793
to explode CRATUS II

01:03:16.836 --> 01:03:18.751
and hopefully take
the Megs with it.

01:03:18.795 --> 01:03:20.231
Everybody know what to do?

01:03:23.843 --> 01:03:25.192
All right,
you'’re going to need

01:03:25.236 --> 01:03:26.803
to get your belongings
together.

01:03:26.846 --> 01:03:28.456
We'’re gonna meet
down at the sub.

01:03:28.500 --> 01:03:30.415
We'’ve got three minutes.

01:03:30.458 --> 01:03:33.461
Who did you say was gonna
turn the well pipe offline?

01:03:33.505 --> 01:03:34.723
I will take the mini-sub,

01:03:34.767 --> 01:03:36.421
and I will turn
the well pipe offline.

01:03:36.464 --> 01:03:38.292
- No.
-You can'’t do that.

01:03:38.336 --> 01:03:39.250
I'’ll do it.

01:03:41.078 --> 01:03:43.123
You'’re way too important
to this operation, Kurt.

01:03:43.167 --> 01:03:45.778
- We can'’t do it without you.
- I'’m too important?

01:03:45.822 --> 01:03:47.998
Dr. Clark, this is your project.

01:03:48.041 --> 01:03:49.913
They'’re gonna need you
to make the next one.

01:03:49.956 --> 01:03:51.131
You need this fixed, yeah?

01:03:51.175 --> 01:03:52.263
Let me fix it for you.

01:03:53.612 --> 01:03:54.874
Okay.

01:03:54.918 --> 01:03:56.789
Well, how close are we

01:03:56.833 --> 01:03:59.139
to figuring out how
to lure the Megalodons here?

01:03:59.183 --> 01:04:00.532
By changing the frequency

01:04:00.575 --> 01:04:02.316
of our radio signal
to 100 gigahertz,

01:04:02.360 --> 01:04:04.057
we will cause
a massive vibration

01:04:04.101 --> 01:04:06.016
caused by
electromagnetic energy.

01:04:08.540 --> 01:04:10.107
It'’ll be sent underwater.

01:04:10.150 --> 01:04:12.544
It'’s the same way that we
drew in the last Megalodon,

01:04:12.587 --> 01:04:14.502
only this way
uses radio frequency,

01:04:14.546 --> 01:04:17.897
so it'’ll travel further.

01:04:17.941 --> 01:04:20.465
Once we do that,
all the Megalodons in the area

01:04:20.508 --> 01:04:21.858
will be drawn to its source,

01:04:21.901 --> 01:04:23.642
especially if they think
the pregnant Megalodon

01:04:23.685 --> 01:04:24.948
is in any sort of danger.

01:04:24.991 --> 01:04:28.560
This should also keep
our pregnant Megalodon

01:04:28.603 --> 01:04:30.170
in the area for us.

01:04:30.214 --> 01:04:32.303
Well, downside is,

01:04:32.346 --> 01:04:34.435
they'’re gonna be
more aggressive than normal.

01:04:34.479 --> 01:04:36.350
Be prepared for that.

01:04:36.394 --> 01:04:38.526
What if the station
loses power?

01:04:38.570 --> 01:04:40.615
How do you keep
that vibration consistent?

01:04:40.659 --> 01:04:43.053
Well, the station
would only lose power

01:04:43.096 --> 01:04:44.315
if the volcano goes dormant

01:04:44.358 --> 01:04:46.795
or if the station
itself explodes,

01:04:46.839 --> 01:04:49.320
so I think we'’ll be fine.

01:04:49.363 --> 01:04:51.322
What did you say
the range was?

01:04:51.365 --> 01:04:54.978
If my calculations are correct,
it should be a couple miles,

01:04:55.021 --> 01:04:56.849
enough to lure
any Megalodons in there,

01:04:56.893 --> 01:04:58.285
would give us
trouble at sea.

01:04:58.329 --> 01:05:00.505
How soon will it be ready?

01:05:00.548 --> 01:05:01.898
It'’s rigged up.

01:05:01.941 --> 01:05:04.117
I had to make
a few adjustments,

01:05:04.161 --> 01:05:05.510
but we'’re good to go.

01:05:06.815 --> 01:05:07.991
Engaging signal.

01:05:12.691 --> 01:05:13.779
Is it working?

01:05:17.870 --> 01:05:20.177
- Okay, turn that thing off.
- Yeah.

01:05:20.220 --> 01:05:21.961
We want to give Kurt
as much protection

01:05:22.005 --> 01:05:24.572
as he can possibly have
when he goes down there.

01:05:24.616 --> 01:05:25.791
Kristy,
you'’re gonna go with me.

01:05:25.834 --> 01:05:27.445
You'’ve got
the CRATUS blueprints.

01:05:27.488 --> 01:05:29.969
It will show us where
to plant those explosives

01:05:30.013 --> 01:05:32.058
for maximum efficiency.

01:05:32.102 --> 01:05:34.843
Uh, Hilton,
get your hard drives,

01:05:34.887 --> 01:05:36.845
rest of your data.

01:05:36.889 --> 01:05:38.543
We'’ve got to head down
to the sub.

01:05:38.586 --> 01:05:40.501
Okay, let'’s go.

01:05:42.460 --> 01:05:43.548
Kurt.

01:05:45.854 --> 01:05:48.770
I want you on that headset
with me the whole time.

01:05:50.511 --> 01:05:51.556
Okay.

01:06:09.574 --> 01:06:11.358
- Okay, come on.
- Okay.

01:06:15.493 --> 01:06:16.668
There.

01:06:24.806 --> 01:06:26.765
Headed towards the valve.

01:06:26.808 --> 01:06:28.767
What'’s the status
on the explosives?

01:06:28.810 --> 01:06:32.075
All good, thanks to
the details in Kristy'’s binder.

01:06:32.118 --> 01:06:34.903
Oh, I'’m sure you
could have figured it out,

01:06:34.947 --> 01:06:36.122
but just wanted to make sure

01:06:36.166 --> 01:06:37.558
you have all
the information you needed.

01:06:37.602 --> 01:06:39.996
You just pay attention
to what you have to do.

01:06:40.039 --> 01:06:41.258
You know what'’s out there.

01:06:41.301 --> 01:06:42.955
Copy that.

01:06:42.999 --> 01:06:44.391
Headed to lower depths now.

01:06:50.049 --> 01:06:52.008
- Okay.
- We still need a few more,

01:06:52.051 --> 01:06:54.227
just to be safe.
The blueprints are very clear.

01:06:54.271 --> 01:06:55.663
We don'’t have anything left.

01:06:55.707 --> 01:06:57.187
We--Our materials are shot.

01:06:57.230 --> 01:06:58.492
We gotta sync
everything to my watch.

01:06:58.536 --> 01:06:59.580
Okay.

01:06:59.624 --> 01:07:00.973
How you doing down there, Kurt?

01:07:02.018 --> 01:07:03.541
Located the valve.

01:07:03.584 --> 01:07:04.977
Now I just need
to deactivate it,

01:07:05.021 --> 01:07:06.761
and I'’ll be
back on my way to CRATUS.

01:07:13.942 --> 01:07:15.335
Come on.

01:07:17.250 --> 01:07:18.860
Come on.

01:07:18.904 --> 01:07:20.427
Do we have any more?

01:07:20.471 --> 01:07:23.213
We'’re almost there.
We need to get to that sub.

01:07:23.256 --> 01:07:25.041
It'’s the last one.
We'’re out of materials.

01:07:25.084 --> 01:07:26.477
Just plant '’em. I'll sync '’em.

01:07:26.520 --> 01:07:27.826
Okay. You got it.

01:07:27.869 --> 01:07:28.783
Kurt, are you there?

01:07:31.177 --> 01:07:33.005
Got it. Valve is deactivated.

01:07:33.049 --> 01:07:35.138
I repeat, valve is deactivated.

01:07:35.181 --> 01:07:36.704
You got it. You got it.

01:07:47.628 --> 01:07:49.369
You guys okay up there?

01:07:49.413 --> 01:07:51.241
I'’m on my way back now.

01:07:52.546 --> 01:07:54.113
We'’re okay.

01:07:54.157 --> 01:07:55.941
Okay.

01:07:55.984 --> 01:07:58.900
I'’m coming in,
and I'’m coming in hot.

01:07:58.944 --> 01:08:00.772
Make sure the access bay
is open for me.

01:08:00.815 --> 01:08:02.513
We only got one shot at this.

01:08:02.556 --> 01:08:04.036
I know.

01:08:09.955 --> 01:08:11.826
Come on, baby.

01:08:11.870 --> 01:08:13.306
Come on, baby.

01:08:22.446 --> 01:08:25.579
It'’s open, Kurt! It's open!

01:08:25.623 --> 01:08:26.972
We have to go. We have to go.

01:08:31.542 --> 01:08:33.239
Ah, come on.

01:08:33.283 --> 01:08:34.371
Come on, baby.

01:08:34.414 --> 01:08:35.720
Come on, baby!

01:08:49.212 --> 01:08:50.430
Come on.

01:08:54.173 --> 01:08:56.132
Come on!

01:08:58.917 --> 01:09:01.180
Kurt, are you there?! Kurt?!

01:09:01.224 --> 01:09:03.356
Kurt, please answer.

01:09:03.400 --> 01:09:04.662
Kurt, please answer.

01:09:04.705 --> 01:09:06.185
Kurt, come in. Kurt, come in.

01:09:08.013 --> 01:09:10.581
Dr. Clark, I'’m so sorry,
but we have to get out of here.

01:09:14.628 --> 01:09:16.195
You'’re right.
We gotta get on that sub.

01:09:16.239 --> 01:09:17.544
We'’re running out of time.

01:09:20.591 --> 01:09:22.506
I'’m at the sub.
Where are you?

01:09:31.341 --> 01:09:34.344
Everybody okay?

01:09:34.387 --> 01:09:36.041
All in one piece?

01:09:36.084 --> 01:09:38.217
Okay, we'’re all here.
We'’re okay.

01:09:38.261 --> 01:09:39.566
Ah, good.

01:09:39.610 --> 01:09:41.525
Okay.

01:09:41.568 --> 01:09:44.397
A-Are you sure you don'’t
need any more help with--

01:09:44.441 --> 01:09:46.138
Oh, God.

01:09:46.182 --> 01:09:49.141
You'’ve already done
so much more than was needed.

01:09:49.185 --> 01:09:51.448
If it weren'’t for you,
I wouldn'’t even be here.

01:09:51.491 --> 01:09:52.623
Thank you.

01:09:52.666 --> 01:09:54.102
Of course.

01:09:54.146 --> 01:09:57.541
Now, Dr. Hilton, this is
the plan I have in mind.

01:09:57.584 --> 01:09:59.238
We'’re gonna raise
those floodgates,

01:09:59.282 --> 01:10:01.153
we'’re gonna release
that radio signal,

01:10:01.197 --> 01:10:02.807
and we'’re gonna
get the hell out of here.

01:10:02.850 --> 01:10:04.243
Good.

01:10:04.287 --> 01:10:06.071
Looking forward
to having all this behind us.

01:10:06.114 --> 01:10:07.812
Yeah.

01:10:07.855 --> 01:10:08.769
Yeah.

01:10:10.554 --> 01:10:11.729
Let'’s get this done.

01:10:19.650 --> 01:10:21.086
Everyone secure?

01:10:21.129 --> 01:10:22.827
As secure as we'’re gonna be.

01:10:22.870 --> 01:10:24.263
Here we go.

01:10:30.269 --> 01:10:33.141
I'’m gonna set it off
the second we get a visual.

01:10:33.185 --> 01:10:35.056
We don'’t know
if they'’ll be close enough.

01:10:35.100 --> 01:10:36.536
They move fast.

01:10:36.580 --> 01:10:38.408
They'’re gonna keep following
our radio signal.

01:10:38.451 --> 01:10:41.715
We'’ve gotta be able to act
before they even notice us,

01:10:41.759 --> 01:10:43.674
so you'’ve gotta
keep your eyes open.

01:10:48.766 --> 01:10:50.507
- Ohh!
- They'’re here.

01:10:50.550 --> 01:10:51.899
Hit that detonator.

01:10:52.987 --> 01:10:53.988
What happened?

01:10:54.032 --> 01:10:55.729
It'’s not linking. Kristy.

01:10:55.773 --> 01:10:57.427
I-I didn'’t link it. Uh...

01:10:57.470 --> 01:11:00.168
What? Kristy, I told you.

01:11:00.212 --> 01:11:02.736
I'’m sorry. We were--
We were locked down,

01:11:02.780 --> 01:11:04.521
and it was an emergency, and--

01:11:04.564 --> 01:11:06.392
Anyone have eyes
on the Megalodon?

01:11:06.436 --> 01:11:07.654
There'’s nothing on this side.

01:11:07.698 --> 01:11:09.482
Kristy, is there any way

01:11:09.526 --> 01:11:11.484
to get that detonator working?

01:11:11.528 --> 01:11:13.312
Kurt gave you
the binder on it.

01:11:13.356 --> 01:11:15.314
We have got to sink the CRATUS.

01:11:15.358 --> 01:11:18.926
Dr. Clark, I left the binder
on the CRATUS.

01:11:18.970 --> 01:11:20.145
I'’m so sorry.

01:11:20.188 --> 01:11:21.799
No, no, no, no!

01:11:21.842 --> 01:11:24.323
We have to get out of here.

01:11:24.367 --> 01:11:25.324
Hold on.

01:11:25.368 --> 01:11:27.457
Evasive maneuvers, now!

01:11:27.500 --> 01:11:28.806
Hold on!

01:11:38.468 --> 01:11:40.513
Uh, still nothing, Dr. Clark.

01:11:40.557 --> 01:11:42.341
Okay, give me a minute.

01:11:42.385 --> 01:11:43.560
Let me think.

01:11:43.603 --> 01:11:45.910
Maybe if we--
if we circle around

01:11:45.953 --> 01:11:48.695
and sneak through a gap
in the CRATUS structure,

01:11:48.739 --> 01:11:50.262
they'’ll get stuck
while they'’re pursuing us.

01:11:50.306 --> 01:11:52.395
Or--Or at least
buy us some time.

01:11:52.438 --> 01:11:54.440
I can'’t think
of anything better.

01:11:54.484 --> 01:11:56.312
We'’re gonna have to do it.
Let'’s do it.

01:12:01.404 --> 01:12:02.753
There.

01:12:02.796 --> 01:12:04.624
That'’s the only gap
we can squeeze through.

01:12:04.668 --> 01:12:05.538
Looks awfully tight.

01:12:05.582 --> 01:12:06.844
Just trust me.

01:12:06.887 --> 01:12:08.715
I drew up the blueprints
for this sub.

01:12:08.759 --> 01:12:09.716
We can fit.

01:12:11.065 --> 01:12:12.850
All right.

01:12:12.893 --> 01:12:13.807
All right.

01:12:19.335 --> 01:12:20.597
Come on.

01:12:20.640 --> 01:12:21.946
Come on. Come on.

01:12:21.989 --> 01:12:23.339
Come on. Come on.

01:12:37.048 --> 01:12:38.310
Wait. Wait.

01:12:39.703 --> 01:12:41.661
What'’s that?

01:12:41.705 --> 01:12:44.925
Please tell me those
are great whites, right?

01:12:50.017 --> 01:12:51.802
No.

01:12:51.845 --> 01:12:53.151
Those are its pups.

01:12:54.239 --> 01:12:56.546
The Megalodon gave birth.

01:13:07.600 --> 01:13:09.428
This is
the crew of the CRATUS.

01:13:09.472 --> 01:13:11.082
Please answer if you can.
Over.

01:13:11.125 --> 01:13:12.823
This is the King.Over.

01:13:12.866 --> 01:13:14.520
Captain Sharp,
we'’ve got the crew

01:13:14.564 --> 01:13:16.304
of the CRATUS on the sub.

01:13:16.348 --> 01:13:19.351
We have five
adult Megalodons all over us.

01:13:19.395 --> 01:13:21.048
One of them gave birth.

01:13:21.092 --> 01:13:23.181
We'’re covered
in dozens of pups.

01:13:23.224 --> 01:13:25.096
We'’re trying to shake them now.

01:13:25.139 --> 01:13:26.663
One of them gave birth.

01:13:26.706 --> 01:13:28.404
And these things
may be babies,

01:13:28.447 --> 01:13:30.667
but they'’re 20 feet long,
and they'’re hungry.

01:13:30.710 --> 01:13:32.930
Well, why are they following
you and not the signal?

01:13:32.973 --> 01:13:35.062
I'’m not sure.
They'’re trying to feed.

01:13:35.106 --> 01:13:37.151
We'’re the only thing
moving around down here.

01:13:37.195 --> 01:13:39.284
Okay, what about
the detonation?

01:13:39.327 --> 01:13:41.895
Remote detonation didn'’t work.

01:13:41.939 --> 01:13:44.985
We need these things
off of us as soon as we can.

01:13:45.029 --> 01:13:46.900
We'’ve got to bring
this lab down.

01:13:46.944 --> 01:13:49.381
And we can'’t
just trap them inside?

01:13:49.425 --> 01:13:51.252
Not without getting
back inside the CRATUS,

01:13:51.296 --> 01:13:52.993
and it'’s not an option.

01:13:53.037 --> 01:13:54.168
Oh, man.

01:13:54.212 --> 01:13:56.127
What kind of distraction
do you need?

01:13:56.170 --> 01:13:59.696
These Megalodons,
they seem to be attacking

01:13:59.739 --> 01:14:01.480
the biggest thing in the area.

01:14:01.524 --> 01:14:04.483
If you could get
your ship close to us...

01:14:04.527 --> 01:14:06.093
they may just peel off.

01:14:06.137 --> 01:14:09.053
We'’ve got to get them
to follow that radio signal,

01:14:09.096 --> 01:14:10.402
draw them in.

01:14:10.446 --> 01:14:12.056
Sync it up with the CRATUS,

01:14:12.099 --> 01:14:13.927
with the blast from the sub,

01:14:13.971 --> 01:14:15.189
sync the explosion,

01:14:15.233 --> 01:14:17.017
and then get
the hell out of here

01:14:17.061 --> 01:14:18.758
and take '’em down
in the process.

01:14:18.802 --> 01:14:21.195
We'’ll make it happen.
Just hold tight.

01:14:21.239 --> 01:14:22.370
Please hurry.

01:14:25.504 --> 01:14:27.158
Brunson, how we looking?!

01:14:27.201 --> 01:14:28.725
I think we'’re ready, sir.

01:14:28.768 --> 01:14:30.901
Okay, Marines,
we need to move this wreck

01:14:30.944 --> 01:14:32.250
toward the CRATUS now.

01:14:32.293 --> 01:14:33.469
The scientists need
some breathing room

01:14:33.512 --> 01:14:34.644
to rig the station to blow,

01:14:34.687 --> 01:14:36.515
and we have to get
those Megs off them

01:14:36.559 --> 01:14:37.908
to buy them
a few minutes, okay?

01:14:37.951 --> 01:14:40.171
We know what that means,
Captain,

01:14:40.214 --> 01:14:42.303
and we'’re ready.

01:14:42.347 --> 01:14:44.001
I need to know
that you can handle this.

01:14:44.044 --> 01:14:46.003
We'’re going into something
we'’ve never seen before.

01:14:46.046 --> 01:14:47.918
Semper fi,Cap.

01:14:47.961 --> 01:14:51.138
We gotta try to let
those civilians get to safety.

01:14:51.182 --> 01:14:53.053
And if that means
we gotta be the bait...

01:14:54.141 --> 01:14:55.578
then we gotta be the bait.

01:14:55.621 --> 01:14:56.970
Hoo-rah, sir!

01:14:57.014 --> 01:14:57.971
Oo-rah!

01:14:58.015 --> 01:14:59.364
Oo-rah!

01:14:59.407 --> 01:15:00.887
It'’s been an honor, men.

01:15:00.931 --> 01:15:03.063
Tolbert, get whatever
you can together,

01:15:03.107 --> 01:15:05.849
and rig this whole sip to blow.
Just in case.

01:15:07.807 --> 01:15:08.765
Time'’s a-wastin'.

01:15:08.808 --> 01:15:10.201
Let'’s go to work!

01:15:13.334 --> 01:15:15.162
Cap, heads up!

01:15:17.469 --> 01:15:19.645
Okay, Dr. Clark.

01:15:19.689 --> 01:15:21.647
There'’s your window.

01:15:21.691 --> 01:15:23.562
There'’s nothing on the sonar.

01:15:23.606 --> 01:15:24.694
Are we clear?

01:15:24.737 --> 01:15:26.391
I think they'’re gone.

01:15:26.434 --> 01:15:29.002
I think the distraction worked.

01:15:29.046 --> 01:15:32.223
Let'’s find a way
to bring this station down.

01:15:36.532 --> 01:15:38.403
Hold! Hold!

01:15:38.446 --> 01:15:40.840
Fire at will!

01:15:50.415 --> 01:15:52.243
Stand your ground, Marines!

01:15:52.286 --> 01:15:53.810
Make '’em work for it!

01:16:04.255 --> 01:16:06.083
No looking back now, Marines.

01:16:06.126 --> 01:16:08.955
If they'’re still fighting,
so are we!

01:16:08.999 --> 01:16:10.043
Come on!

01:16:10.087 --> 01:16:12.524
You got
that radio signal ready?

01:16:12.568 --> 01:16:14.221
We'’re gonna try this again.

01:16:14.265 --> 01:16:16.572
Okay. Let me just try
resetting the signal.

01:16:16.615 --> 01:16:17.573
- Hurry.
- Come on.

01:16:17.616 --> 01:16:18.922
Come on.

01:16:18.965 --> 01:16:19.879
Ah, come on.

01:16:21.185 --> 01:16:23.274
Okay, here goes.

01:16:26.973 --> 01:16:28.671
Is there
anything else we can do?

01:16:28.714 --> 01:16:30.629
Wh-What about the laser drill?

01:16:30.673 --> 01:16:32.979
Drill'’s only at 50% power.

01:16:33.023 --> 01:16:34.590
But we'’ve gotta take the shot.

01:16:34.633 --> 01:16:37.027
Kristy,
you know those blueprints.

01:16:37.070 --> 01:16:39.377
What'’s the focal point I need?

01:16:39.420 --> 01:16:43.294
There. There, the intersection
of those two support beams.

01:16:43.337 --> 01:16:44.730
If we can punch a hole
through that,

01:16:44.774 --> 01:16:46.123
it should bring
the whole thing down.

01:16:46.166 --> 01:16:47.820
No, with us
directly underneath it,

01:16:47.864 --> 01:16:48.995
There'’s no time.

01:16:49.039 --> 01:16:50.649
I'’m starting with the laser.

01:16:50.693 --> 01:16:53.086
You rewire
that detonator now.

01:16:53.130 --> 01:16:54.653
- Okay.
- And keep trying

01:16:54.697 --> 01:16:56.786
the remote frequency until
we get a signal to connect.

01:16:56.829 --> 01:16:57.874
On it.

01:16:57.917 --> 01:16:59.527
What if the laser doesn'’t work?

01:16:59.571 --> 01:17:01.921
Then I'’m gonna
have to drive this damn sub

01:17:01.965 --> 01:17:03.836
right through the station.

01:17:03.880 --> 01:17:04.837
I'’m out!

01:17:04.881 --> 01:17:06.665
I'’m out, too!

01:17:06.709 --> 01:17:08.406
Hang on, Tolbert!

01:17:08.449 --> 01:17:10.843
Okay, you sons of bitches!

01:17:10.887 --> 01:17:12.758
Come and get me!

01:17:22.594 --> 01:17:24.465
Aiming at the weak point now.

01:17:24.509 --> 01:17:26.119
How are we looking, Dr. Clark?

01:17:26.163 --> 01:17:27.512
Not good.

01:17:27.555 --> 01:17:29.035
With the laser
at half-strength,

01:17:29.079 --> 01:17:31.081
it'’s gonna take a few minutes.

01:17:32.996 --> 01:17:35.085
Sonar'’s picking up shapes
coming right at us.

01:17:35.128 --> 01:17:37.478
We haven'’t turned off
the radio signal.

01:17:37.522 --> 01:17:38.828
We must be
the only threat left.

01:17:38.871 --> 01:17:41.657
Oh, come on.
Just another minute.

01:17:44.834 --> 01:17:46.444
They'’re coming in fast!

01:17:46.487 --> 01:17:49.055
How do we get out of here
before getting eaten

01:17:49.099 --> 01:17:50.883
or caught in that explosion?
There'’s no way.

01:17:50.927 --> 01:17:53.277
I don'’t know.
We have to blow it up now.

01:17:53.320 --> 01:17:55.932
Wait. Wait.
Going full throttle,

01:17:55.975 --> 01:17:58.456
combined with the explosion,
will throw us out of here.

01:17:58.499 --> 01:17:59.936
Worth a shot.

01:17:59.979 --> 01:18:01.633
Everyone, hang on.

01:18:11.251 --> 01:18:12.383
Okay.

01:18:13.906 --> 01:18:15.821
Uplink! The signal is good!

01:18:15.865 --> 01:18:16.909
Hit it, Kristy!

01:18:32.403 --> 01:18:35.319
Ohh! Ohh!

01:18:40.846 --> 01:18:42.718
Dr. Hilton, damage report.

01:18:42.761 --> 01:18:44.241
We'’re breached
on several sides.

01:18:44.284 --> 01:18:46.547
Our oxygen supply
is depleting, and our...

01:18:47.984 --> 01:18:49.942
our laser'’s broken
beyond repair.

01:18:49.986 --> 01:18:51.161
Engines?

01:18:51.204 --> 01:18:52.510
No, the engines are fine.

01:18:52.553 --> 01:18:54.164
Nothing to report right now.

01:18:58.037 --> 01:19:00.953
Anybody see any signs?

01:19:00.997 --> 01:19:02.433
Any signs of them?

01:19:02.476 --> 01:19:04.652
I'’m not seeing
a thing on this sonar.

01:19:04.696 --> 01:19:05.653
How '’bout you?

01:19:05.697 --> 01:19:07.830
No, not over here, either.

01:19:10.920 --> 01:19:13.270
We actually managed
to pull it off.

01:19:13.313 --> 01:19:14.793
We may have.

01:19:14.837 --> 01:19:16.621
We just may have.

01:19:17.796 --> 01:19:19.842
But the sub
can only go so far.

01:19:19.885 --> 01:19:21.757
We gotta find some land.

01:19:21.800 --> 01:19:23.367
We gotta find some land

01:19:23.410 --> 01:19:26.239
and wait it out
until somebody comes for us.

01:19:26.283 --> 01:19:27.588
I know a place.

01:19:36.206 --> 01:19:39.209
You know, we'’re never
gonna know their names.

01:19:39.252 --> 01:19:41.167
Except Captain Sharp.

01:19:43.735 --> 01:19:47.173
Lot of good people died
trying to save us.

01:19:47.217 --> 01:19:48.871
And Kurt.

01:19:50.786 --> 01:19:54.050
Without them,
we never would have made it.

01:19:56.400 --> 01:19:58.358
But we did make it.

01:19:58.402 --> 01:20:00.665
We did make it. We made it.

01:20:03.624 --> 01:20:06.627
Hey, I think I see a ship.

01:20:08.891 --> 01:20:10.283
Hey!

01:20:10.327 --> 01:20:12.808
Over here! Over here!

01:20:15.158 --> 01:20:17.943
What? What--We'’re here.

01:20:17.987 --> 01:20:20.685
Oh! Oh, God, thank you!

01:20:20.728 --> 01:20:21.991
Thank you!

01:20:22.034 --> 01:20:25.733
We'’re safe!

01:20:25.777 --> 01:20:27.257
Oh, my God.

01:20:27.300 --> 01:20:30.042
Thank you. Thank you.

01:20:31.652 --> 01:20:33.002
Over here!

01:20:33.045 --> 01:20:34.917
Hey! Over here!

01:20:36.048 --> 01:20:37.223
- We'’re safe!
- We made it!

01:20:37.267 --> 01:20:38.659
We'’re safe!
