(mellow music playing)

00:50.233 --> 00:53.033
(humming "Now Or Never")

01:07.100 --> 01:07.867
What are you doing?

01:07.934 --> 01:10.533
What does it look like?
I'm putting clam sauce in my suitcase.

01:11.300 --> 01:13.734
Ma, I think they serve a snack
on the flight.

01:13.800 --> 01:16.166
(sarcastic laugh)
You kill me.

01:17.934 --> 01:20.600
Ma, why are you taking all this food
to Phil's?

01:20.667 --> 01:24.000
Because the only time
your brother's wife goes into the kitchen,

01:24.066 --> 01:25.533
it's to get a cold beer.

01:26.800 --> 01:29.600
Ma, she has no time to cook.
She works all day.

01:29.667 --> 01:32.333
Welding. My son married a welder.

01:33.233 --> 01:36.800
Too bad she didn't weld his zipper shut.
They got ten kids they can't afford.

01:41.000 --> 01:41.834
Grab that.

01:45.133 --> 01:48.633
Come on, Ma, now, be nice.
They're looking forward to your visit.

01:48.700 --> 01:51.233
The six boys are giving up
their bedroom for you.

01:51.300 --> 01:53.734
It'll be a miserable week.
I don't even know why I'm going.

01:53.800 --> 01:55.967
Ma, it's your grandson's graduation.

01:56.033 --> 01:57.100
Big deal.

01:57.166 --> 01:58.767
Animal grooming school.

01:58.834 --> 02:01.967
He'll know how to make that fluffy ball
at the end of a poodle's tail.

02:04.467 --> 02:08.300
Dorothy, I've just discovered
a great new way to meet more men.

02:08.367 --> 02:09.400
More men?

02:09.467 --> 02:11.500
You're gonna need a turnstile
in your bedroom.

02:13.767 --> 02:15.900
I enrolled in a CPR class.

02:16.367 --> 02:18.900
For six consecutive hours,
I was on my back

02:18.967 --> 02:22.300
while dozens of eligible men
pressed their lips to mine

02:22.367 --> 02:24.600
and breathed air into my limp little body.

02:25.300 --> 02:29.600
So what? You did the same thing
at McSorley's Bar Super Bowl weekend.

02:31.300 --> 02:32.367
How do I look?

02:32.433 --> 02:34.900
-Ooh.
-Oh, terrific.

02:34.967 --> 02:36.467
I'll say.

02:36.533 --> 02:40.233
To the untrained eye,
that polyester could almost pass for silk.

02:41.867 --> 02:42.934
It is silk.

02:43.000 --> 02:47.000
Oh, sure, Rose, and Cheryl Tiegs
really buys her clothes at Sears.

02:47.066 --> 02:48.066
(both chuckle)

02:48.133 --> 02:50.633
So, uh, where are you going?

02:50.700 --> 02:52.433
Out with a friend from work.

02:52.500 --> 02:55.433
Is it the same friend you've been out with
five times in the last three weeks?

02:55.500 --> 02:58.467
-Yes.
-All right. Spill it. Who is he?

02:58.533 --> 03:00.834
His name is Dr. Jonathan Newman.

03:00.900 --> 03:02.734
He's a psychiatrist at the grief center.

03:02.800 --> 03:05.467
So, Rose, you're seeing a psychiatrist.

03:05.533 --> 03:06.934
It's about time.

03:09.467 --> 03:11.667
The woman gives names
to her gingerbread men.

03:13.433 --> 03:14.934
I'm ready to go to the airport.

03:15.000 --> 03:17.233
Oh, I'm going that way, Sophia.
I can take you.

03:17.300 --> 03:18.500
Thanks, Rose.

03:18.567 --> 03:20.934
-(Sophia) Fine.
-Wait a minute, you can't run out of here.

03:21.033 --> 03:23.500
We want to hear more
about this doctor of yours.

03:23.567 --> 03:27.900
Oh, well, there's not much to tell.
He's a great guy, and I like him a lot.

03:27.967 --> 03:29.233
Can't wait to meet him.

03:29.300 --> 03:31.266
And his eligible doctor friends.

03:31.333 --> 03:32.133
That's right.

03:32.600 --> 03:35.433
Well, he's very busy,
but we'll have him over soon.

03:35.500 --> 03:36.633
Well, when?

03:36.700 --> 03:38.000
Soon, I promise.

03:38.066 --> 03:39.567
Come on, Sophia, let's go.

03:39.633 --> 03:43.033
Ma, have a wonderful trip
and call me the minute you get there.

03:43.100 --> 03:46.900
And, please, Ma,
try not to argue with Phil's wife.

03:47.367 --> 03:50.600
We get along ok.
Phil's wife has her good points.

03:50.667 --> 03:52.734
She's sweet, she's reliable,

03:52.800 --> 03:55.333
and when her father gets out of prison,
she'll be a wealthy woman.

03:56.700 --> 03:58.934
Let's roll, Rose. I'm leaking clam sauce.

04:00.767 --> 04:03.767
(mellow music playing)

04:09.934 --> 04:10.934
You're angry.

04:11.000 --> 04:13.600
-I am not.
-Yes, you are. I can tell.

04:13.667 --> 04:16.300
When you're really angry,
you purse your little lips so tight,

04:16.367 --> 04:17.367
they almost disappear.

04:20.467 --> 04:21.166
See?

04:21.734 --> 04:23.333
(Dorothy) Have her lips come out yet?

04:24.467 --> 04:26.133
Nope. She's still mad at me.

04:26.200 --> 04:27.400
I'm not mad.

04:27.467 --> 04:29.500
But if I were,
I'd have every reason to be.

04:29.567 --> 04:32.400
Rose, come on now.
You're about to swallow your chin.

04:33.633 --> 04:37.000
It's just that the invitation to dinner
should have come from me.

04:37.066 --> 04:41.166
I asked you three times in this past week
to invite dr. Newman to dinner,

04:41.233 --> 04:42.500
and you always put it off.

04:42.567 --> 04:45.367
I didn't put it off. I... I just forgot.

04:45.433 --> 04:47.700
When he called today,
I invited him myself.

04:47.767 --> 04:49.400
And he says
he's looking forward to coming.

04:49.467 --> 04:51.333
Well, you should have still
asked me first.

04:51.400 --> 04:53.667
You're right, honey,
but he's on his way over.

04:53.734 --> 04:54.934
We made a terrific dinner.

04:55.000 --> 04:57.967
So why don't you just relax
and enjoy a lovely evening?

04:58.033 --> 04:58.967
You don't understand.

04:59.033 --> 05:01.567
Jonathan is a very special person.

05:01.633 --> 05:04.667
I don't want you doing or saying anything
that would embarrass him.

05:04.734 --> 05:06.633
Oh, Rose, come on,
it's gonna be wonderful.

05:06.700 --> 05:08.834
Now, stop worrying, go check on dinner.

05:15.900 --> 05:19.400
I can't wait to meet Dr. Newman.
He was fascinating on the phone.

05:19.467 --> 05:23.633
-He analyzed my dream.
-What dream?

05:23.700 --> 05:27.333
Oh, that recurring dream I have
where I'm running naked through a train

05:27.400 --> 05:29.033
that keeps going
through tunnel after tunnel

05:29.100 --> 05:31.266
while a sweaty bodybuilder chases me.

05:33.033 --> 05:34.734
He said he thinks it's sexual.

05:36.800 --> 05:40.967
He thinks? For God's sake, Blanche,
you smoke a cigarette after that dream.

05:43.867 --> 05:46.066
-Not all my dreams are sexual.
-(doorbell rings)

05:46.133 --> 05:48.166
I also dream about food.

05:48.767 --> 05:50.834
'Course, I'm usually naked
while I'm eating the food.

05:51.967 --> 05:54.033
You know, maybe all my dreams are sexual.

05:54.567 --> 05:55.900
Lucky me.
(chuckles)

05:56.367 --> 05:59.333
Oh, no, thank you, little boy,
we already take the Miami Herald.

06:02.934 --> 06:03.767
Who was that?

06:03.834 --> 06:06.500
Oh, just one of the Donaldson Boys
trying to sell us

06:06.567 --> 06:09.300
-a newspaper subscription again.
-(doorbell rings)

06:09.367 --> 06:12.700
Oh, those Donaldson kids
won't take no for an answer.

06:12.767 --> 06:15.633
Neither would their father
at our fourth of July barbecue.

06:17.000 --> 06:19.233
Hello. I'm Dr. Jonathan Newman.

06:22.900 --> 06:24.700
Are you absolutely sure?

06:25.633 --> 06:27.266
Yes. May I come in?

06:27.333 --> 06:30.467
Oh, please, please. Please, come right in.

06:30.533 --> 06:34.033
-May I take your heigh... Hat?
-Thank you.

06:35.233 --> 06:38.300
You must be Dorothy.
Rose has told me all about you.

06:39.100 --> 06:41.734
I wish I could say the same.

06:44.066 --> 06:48.200
Oh, Blanche, Blanche,
this is Dr. Jonathan Newman.

06:49.934 --> 06:51.400
Get out of here.

06:52.800 --> 06:54.133
Blanche.

06:55.333 --> 06:56.567
But, Dorothy, he's a...

06:56.633 --> 07:00.400
A little early, yes,
but we're delighted to see him.

07:01.500 --> 07:02.433
Hi, Jonathan.

07:02.500 --> 07:04.934
Hello, Rose.
You're looking lovely this evening.

07:05.000 --> 07:07.033
Oh, wait a minute.

07:07.100 --> 07:09.500
Rose Nylund, you devil, you.

07:09.567 --> 07:12.200
I just figured out what's going on here.

07:12.266 --> 07:13.100
Blanche.

07:14.967 --> 07:17.834
You were sore at me for inviting
your friend without asking you,

07:17.900 --> 07:20.800
so you hired this guy to come over
and teach me a lesson.

07:20.867 --> 07:22.200
You...

07:24.367 --> 07:26.667
(laughs)

07:30.333 --> 07:32.033
God, I wish I was dead.

07:34.767 --> 07:38.400
Blanche, let's go get the hors d'oeuvres.
Excuse us.

07:39.100 --> 07:44.066
Oh, I have never been so embarrassed
in my entire life.

07:44.133 --> 07:46.500
-I made a fool of myself, didn't I?
-Yes.

07:47.033 --> 07:48.900
Oh, I feel awful, just awful.

07:48.967 --> 07:53.333
Listen, if you don't want tonight
to turn into a total disaster,

07:53.400 --> 07:56.266
you have to stop being so self-conscious.

07:56.734 --> 07:58.900
Oh, well, you're right, of course.

07:58.967 --> 08:00.834
Dr. Newman is a guest in our home.

08:00.900 --> 08:03.367
If I'm self-conscious,
he'll be ill at ease.

08:03.433 --> 08:05.133
I can't allow that to happen.

08:05.200 --> 08:07.266
It would be... unsouthern.

08:09.066 --> 08:11.133
That's a good belle.

08:11.200 --> 08:13.967
Dorothy, get the door.

08:19.467 --> 08:20.400
Shrimp?

08:28.967 --> 08:31.233
She's pretty uptight.

08:31.300 --> 08:33.233
I'm gonna have fun teasing her tonight.

08:33.300 --> 08:34.300
Oh, Jonathan.

08:34.367 --> 08:35.734
Why don't we start dinner?

08:35.800 --> 08:37.233
Good. What are we having?

08:43.400 --> 08:44.567
Short ribs.

08:46.567 --> 08:49.567
(mellow music playing)

08:52.433 --> 08:54.367
Anyway, you'll never guess what happened.

08:54.433 --> 08:58.000
I am sitting in this bar in Nairobi
when who do I see?

08:58.066 --> 09:00.166
My roommate from Harvard.
(laughs)

09:00.233 --> 09:03.367
He had decided to go someplace exotic
where he didn't know a soul, either.

09:03.433 --> 09:04.333
(laughter)

09:04.400 --> 09:06.066
Small world, isn't it?

09:07.700 --> 09:08.467
(sighs)

09:09.066 --> 09:13.533
-Not from where I'm standing.
-Oh, I did it again.

09:13.600 --> 09:15.333
I apologize.

09:15.400 --> 09:18.300
-Please forgive me.
-Oh, Blanche, I'm sure he was only joking.

09:18.367 --> 09:21.133
Don't be self-conscious about my height.
I'm not.

09:21.200 --> 09:22.367
-Really?
-Really.

09:23.066 --> 09:26.967
Look, everybody has something
about themselves they'd like to change.

09:27.433 --> 09:29.300
The trick is getting beyond it.

09:29.367 --> 09:30.600
Don't get me wrong,

09:30.667 --> 09:33.967
I'd love to know what it feels like
to be the center on the Boston Celtics,

09:34.033 --> 09:36.734
but all in all,
I'm pretty happy with who I am.

09:37.934 --> 09:40.600
Oh, God, he gives me goose bumps
when he talks like that.

09:42.567 --> 09:44.300
Why don't I fix us all some coffee?

09:44.367 --> 09:45.900
Oh, Blanche, you've done enough.
I'll get it.

09:45.967 --> 09:46.767
I'll help you.

09:52.567 --> 09:54.367
What a delightful man.

09:55.533 --> 10:00.734
You know, he has the most positive
attitude of anyone I have ever met.

10:00.800 --> 10:04.233
And he's wearing the cutest
little gray suit I think I've ever seen.

10:06.066 --> 10:09.266
You just can't help yourself,
can you, Blanche?

10:10.100 --> 10:11.500
I'm home.

10:11.567 --> 10:13.900
Ma, what are you doing here?

10:13.967 --> 10:15.400
There was no reason to stay.

10:15.467 --> 10:18.166
I thought your grandson's graduation
was next week.

10:18.233 --> 10:21.200
There isn't gonna be a graduation.
The big dope failed.

10:22.967 --> 10:24.433
Ma, you're kidding.

10:24.500 --> 10:26.367
You wouldn't be surprised if you saw him.

10:26.433 --> 10:29.066
22 years old and all he did
the whole time I was there

10:29.133 --> 10:31.133
was drink beer
and shoot cans with a BB gun.

10:34.133 --> 10:35.166
Sophia.

10:35.867 --> 10:37.100
Oh, um...

10:39.033 --> 10:39.800
Uh...

10:40.500 --> 10:46.100
Ma, this is Rose's friend,
Dr. Jonathan Newman.

10:46.166 --> 10:48.266
Dr. Newman, this is my mother, Sophia.

10:48.333 --> 10:49.834
Nice to meet you, Sophia.

10:49.900 --> 10:51.467
Nice to meet you, too.

10:51.967 --> 10:53.700
I hope this doesn't sound rude,

10:56.166 --> 10:59.066
but I've just gotten back
from a long trip, and I'm very tired.

10:59.133 --> 11:00.100
If you'll excuse me.

11:00.166 --> 11:01.834
Of course. Nice to have met you.

11:01.900 --> 11:03.033
Likewise.

11:04.033 --> 11:05.900
Dorothy, can I see you for a minute?

11:09.500 --> 11:10.900
Yes, Ma, what is it?

11:11.300 --> 11:13.333
That guy over there, is he a midget?

11:15.000 --> 11:15.667
Yes.

11:15.734 --> 11:18.300
Thank God.
I thought I was having another stroke.

11:21.700 --> 11:24.400
Oh, my goodness,
I didn't realize it was getting so late.

11:24.467 --> 11:26.367
-I really can't stay for coffee.
-Oh.

11:26.433 --> 11:28.934
Ladies, I want to thank you
for a wonderful evening.

11:29.000 --> 11:32.000
Well, thank you for coming.
We certainly enjoyed having you.

11:32.066 --> 11:34.400
And we hope we'll see you again soon.

11:34.467 --> 11:36.867
And I'll see you tomorrow
at the office, Jonathan.

11:36.934 --> 11:41.934
Rose, could we have dinner
tomorrow after work?

11:42.000 --> 11:44.166
There's something important
I want to talk to you about.

11:45.133 --> 11:46.500
Ok, sure.

11:46.567 --> 11:47.867
Great. Good night.

11:47.934 --> 11:48.767
Good night.

11:53.633 --> 11:54.533
Well, what do you think?

11:54.600 --> 11:56.567
(scoffs)
He's quite a man.

11:56.633 --> 11:58.734
Oh, he certainly is, Rose.

11:58.800 --> 12:00.500
(Rose) Oh, I'm glad you both feel that way

12:00.567 --> 12:03.300
because I think Jonathan's gonna ask me
to marry him.

12:03.367 --> 12:05.100
(dishes breaking)

12:07.233 --> 12:10.033
(lively music playing)

12:13.934 --> 12:16.967
(mellow music playing)

12:19.433 --> 12:20.400
Marry him?

12:21.300 --> 12:24.066
Honey, what makes you think
he's going to ask you to marry him?

12:24.667 --> 12:27.033
Well, I know he wants to get remarried.

12:27.100 --> 12:29.633
And our relationship
is getting much more serious.

12:29.700 --> 12:32.700
He asked me to dinner
to talk about something important.

12:32.767 --> 12:35.433
Believe me,
he's gonna ask me to marry him.

12:38.100 --> 12:39.934
And how do you feel about that?

12:40.934 --> 12:41.900
I don't know.

12:42.367 --> 12:44.100
I like him a lot, but...

12:44.166 --> 12:44.934
(sighs)

12:45.000 --> 12:48.333
But you were embarrassed
to have us meet him.

12:48.967 --> 12:50.033
Oh, yes.

12:50.500 --> 12:53.166
I hate myself for feeling like that,
but it's true.

12:53.700 --> 12:57.266
When Jonathan and I are alone together,
everything's wonderful.

12:57.333 --> 13:01.333
But when we're around other people,
I'm uncomfortable.

13:01.800 --> 13:05.300
I know they're staring at him
and they're talking about us,

13:05.367 --> 13:07.233
and it bothers me.

13:07.300 --> 13:09.233
I know it shouldn't, but it does.

13:10.433 --> 13:14.166
I mean, how big a man is
shouldn't make or break a relationship.

13:14.233 --> 13:15.600
Not a word, Blanche.

13:22.266 --> 13:26.700
Rose, you're involved in a relationship
that has very special problems,

13:26.767 --> 13:29.467
and only you and Jonathan can decide

13:29.533 --> 13:32.066
whether those problems
are worth working out.

13:32.934 --> 13:35.266
I can appreciate
what you're going through, Rose.

13:35.333 --> 13:36.000
(exhales)

13:36.567 --> 13:39.266
I once went
through a very similar situation myself.

13:39.333 --> 13:41.600
You once dated a little person?

13:41.667 --> 13:42.633
Oh, no. No, no, no.

13:42.700 --> 13:45.934
What I was referring to
was a relationship I had in high school

13:46.000 --> 13:48.367
with a young man named Benjamin.

13:49.567 --> 13:52.033
Now, you have to understand
that in those days in the south,

13:52.100 --> 13:54.100
a lot of things were still taboo.

13:54.500 --> 13:56.834
Certain people were not to mix.

13:57.633 --> 14:00.367
So, Benjamin and I had to meet in secret.

14:00.834 --> 14:03.867
Oh, we knew if any of the bigots in town
found out about us,

14:03.934 --> 14:05.233
there'd be a terrible scandal.

14:06.800 --> 14:08.834
And then, one day,
I had to make a decision.

14:10.200 --> 14:12.633
Benjamin invited me to our senior prom.

14:14.433 --> 14:15.533
I didn't know what to do.

14:16.266 --> 14:19.200
Should I go out with this boy
I really cared for,

14:19.266 --> 14:22.867
or should I bow to the pressures
of an unjust society?

14:26.400 --> 14:28.967
So, what did you do?

14:32.300 --> 14:35.200
I walked into that gymnasium
on Benjamin's arm.

14:36.200 --> 14:39.100
Heads turned, jaws dropped.

14:39.166 --> 14:41.066
Why, the room was buzzing all evening.

14:41.133 --> 14:42.133
I didn't care.

14:42.200 --> 14:44.600
I had followed my heart.

14:44.667 --> 14:46.600
And I've never regretted it.

14:47.066 --> 14:49.934
Oh, Blanche, that's a beautiful story.

14:50.000 --> 14:52.633
Oh, that must have taken real courage
for both of you.

14:52.700 --> 14:57.300
And it's terrible to think
that the two of you were almost kept apart

14:57.367 --> 15:00.000
just because Benjamin was black.

15:03.400 --> 15:04.066
Black?

15:07.533 --> 15:10.066
Benjamin wasn't black.
He was from New Jersey.

15:17.834 --> 15:20.667
I went to my senior prom with a Yankee!

15:23.967 --> 15:26.200
A Yankee? A Yank...

15:27.967 --> 15:30.433
That is incredible.

15:31.433 --> 15:35.233
And to think they made a movie
about that deadbeat Gandhi

15:37.066 --> 15:40.834
while there's a story like this
that hasn't been told.

15:44.867 --> 15:46.900
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

15:48.266 --> 15:50.066
I'm more confused than ever.

15:50.567 --> 15:51.333
Good night.

16:00.834 --> 16:03.533
Honey, is there anything at all
we can do to help?

16:03.600 --> 16:06.433
No.
I just have to work this out for myself.

16:06.500 --> 16:09.767
Sleep on it, Rose.
I know you'll make the right decision.

16:09.834 --> 16:10.767
Good night, honey.

16:17.367 --> 16:19.266
A Yankee from New Jersey.

16:21.000 --> 16:23.300
You're a profile in courage, Blanche.

16:30.133 --> 16:31.033
(sighs)

16:31.433 --> 16:34.533
(Blanche) <i>Sleep on it, Rose.</i>
<i>I know you'll make the right decision.</i>

16:34.867 --> 16:38.033
(echoing)
<i>The right decision. The right decision.</i>

16:39.300 --> 16:40.300
(knock on door)

16:40.900 --> 16:41.667
Come in.

16:41.734 --> 16:42.734
(door opens)

16:43.767 --> 16:44.867
(sing-song)
Let's go, Rose.

16:44.934 --> 16:46.633
Everyone's waiting for you.

16:47.166 --> 16:49.033
I don't think I can go through with this.

16:49.100 --> 16:51.066
What's the matter?
You and Jonathan have a fight?

16:51.133 --> 16:55.300
No. It's just that I think
marrying Jonathan might be a mistake.

16:55.367 --> 16:57.500
He is a lot shorter than I am.

16:58.467 --> 17:00.667
-Really? I hadn't noticed.
-Me, neither.

17:01.266 --> 17:03.533
Well, how could you miss it?
Everyone notices.

17:03.600 --> 17:05.533
Wherever we go, people stare at him.

17:05.600 --> 17:07.200
Maybe they're staring at you, honey.

17:07.734 --> 17:08.767
At me?

17:08.834 --> 17:10.800
Only a good friend would tell you this,
Rose,

17:10.867 --> 17:12.533
but that color you dye your hair?

17:12.600 --> 17:15.734
Honey, that hasn't existed
since they discontinued the Ford Falcon.

17:18.667 --> 17:19.800
Let's go.

17:22.233 --> 17:24.066
Let's get this wedding on the road.

17:24.133 --> 17:26.633
Sophia, why are you in a priest outfit?

17:26.700 --> 17:28.467
Because I'm the one who's gonna marry you.

17:28.533 --> 17:30.500
But that doesn't make any sense.

17:30.567 --> 17:32.533
What the hell do you want from me?
It's your dream.

17:33.033 --> 17:36.066
-Come on, Rose, let's get you married.
-But I'm still not sure.

17:36.133 --> 17:38.200
Rose, you can't disappoint your guests.

17:38.266 --> 17:40.834
The guests?
But I have to think of what's best for me.

17:40.900 --> 17:42.633
That's only in real life, Rose.

17:42.700 --> 17:44.700
In a dream,
you do what's best for the guests.

17:46.734 --> 17:49.734
All right, all right.
(cackles)

17:50.233 --> 17:52.333
Ah, there's my little girl.

17:52.400 --> 17:54.533
Daddy, I can't believe it's you.

17:54.600 --> 17:55.500
Daddy?

17:56.233 --> 17:58.233
You mean, your dead daddy?

17:58.300 --> 17:59.467
Yes.

17:59.533 --> 18:02.066
You see what lengths people went to
to come to your wedding.

18:02.700 --> 18:07.000
I heard you were getting remarried,
and I wanted to meet the lucky guy.

18:07.467 --> 18:08.834
This is so strange.

18:08.900 --> 18:11.300
I always thought daddy
was much taller than that.

18:11.967 --> 18:13.934
I don't remember him like that at all.

18:14.000 --> 18:17.000
Well, that's probably because
his size didn't matter to you, Rose.

18:17.066 --> 18:18.467
When you really care for someone,

18:18.533 --> 18:20.900
you see them for what they are
on the inside.

18:20.967 --> 18:22.900
Nothing else matters.

18:23.500 --> 18:25.533
Well, actually, girls, Rose is right.

18:25.600 --> 18:27.200
I am much taller.

18:27.266 --> 18:30.433
I just appeared in the dream this way
to make a point.

18:30.500 --> 18:34.533
Oh, daddy, you always did know
the right thing to do.

18:35.133 --> 18:37.734
Do you really think Jonathan and I
will be happy together?

18:37.800 --> 18:41.800
Rose, all you can do is follow your heart.

18:41.867 --> 18:43.700
No one can predict the future.

18:43.767 --> 18:46.633
Not necessarily true, Daddy Lindstrom.

18:46.700 --> 18:49.033
For Rose, you see,
one of your wedding guests

18:49.100 --> 18:53.100
is none other than famed psychic
Jeane Dixon.

18:53.166 --> 18:55.767
(applause)

18:55.834 --> 18:57.133
Hello, Rose.

18:58.467 --> 18:59.700
Hello, Miss Dixon.

18:59.767 --> 19:02.467
Please, call me Jeane. I know you want to.

19:03.400 --> 19:05.000
Wow.

19:05.066 --> 19:07.600
Jeane, could you tell me
what the future holds?

19:07.667 --> 19:08.333
Sure.

19:08.400 --> 19:10.934
In January, Brooke Shields and Lady Di

19:11.000 --> 19:14.100
will star together
in a Broadway musical comedy.

19:14.166 --> 19:15.934
Senator Edward Kennedy
will once again run for...

19:16.000 --> 19:17.133
No.

19:17.200 --> 19:19.867
I mean, what the future holds
for me and Jonathan.

19:21.233 --> 19:25.600
Rose, I'm not getting
a clear picture on that.

19:26.000 --> 19:28.600
However, I do know
Jackie O. will tie the knot again--

19:28.667 --> 19:31.800
Thank you very much, Miss Dixon.
Enjoy the wedding.

19:34.834 --> 19:36.700
Rose, what's the matter?

19:36.767 --> 19:39.967
Oh, I don't know.
I'm so confused, Jonathan.

19:40.033 --> 19:41.333
You see, I... I...

19:42.433 --> 19:43.367
Do you mind?

19:43.433 --> 19:45.367
We'd like to talk in private.

19:45.834 --> 19:48.600
Why are we in the dream in the first place
if she's throwing us out?

19:49.734 --> 19:53.266
Oh, Jonathan, I'm just not sure
I can go through with this.

19:53.333 --> 19:56.400
Rose, I know this may not be
the perfect relationship,

19:56.467 --> 19:58.767
but I care for you very, very much.

19:58.834 --> 20:02.900
If you feel the same way about me,
we can lick any problem, big or small.

20:02.967 --> 20:05.333
Oh, I do care for you, Jonathan.

20:05.400 --> 20:07.033
Then will you marry me?

20:07.934 --> 20:10.567
Yes, yes.

20:10.633 --> 20:12.600
Oh, yes.

20:13.066 --> 20:17.834
-Yes, yes, yes, yes.
-(knock on door)

20:17.900 --> 20:18.800
(Dorothy) Rose?

20:19.867 --> 20:22.100
Oh, Rose, honey. Wake up.

20:22.166 --> 20:24.100
-Rosie, wake up, darlin'.
-Rose.

20:24.166 --> 20:25.533
Wake up, wake up.

20:27.500 --> 20:32.767
Oh, I just had the weirdest dream
about Jonathan.

20:32.834 --> 20:34.333
Oh, was it a bad dream?

20:34.400 --> 20:35.333
No!

20:36.066 --> 20:39.367
No, it helped me make up my mind
about our relationship.

20:40.633 --> 20:42.066
I'm gonna keep seeing him.

20:42.867 --> 20:45.367
If we actually care about each other,

20:46.033 --> 20:49.367
we can lick any problem, big or small.

20:51.133 --> 20:52.266
What's going on?

20:52.333 --> 20:54.934
Oh, Rose has decided
to keep on seeing Jonathan.

20:55.533 --> 20:56.367
Fine.

20:58.734 --> 21:00.233
We're all adults here.

21:00.300 --> 21:03.367
Let the man out of the pillowcase.
We don't mind if he sleeps over.

21:06.600 --> 21:09.633
(light music playing)

21:17.667 --> 21:18.333
Thank you.

21:19.367 --> 21:20.834
Well, what did you think?

21:20.900 --> 21:24.133
Oh, it was delicious. I love French food.

21:24.834 --> 21:26.734
-What was that you had?
-Trout.

21:26.800 --> 21:28.000
What do they call it in French?

21:28.066 --> 21:29.233
Le trout.

21:30.300 --> 21:33.233
Oh, French is such a romantic language.

21:33.800 --> 21:38.633
Oh, I love the food, I love the wine,
and especially the company.

21:39.066 --> 21:40.600
Rose, I've been putting this off
all evening,

21:40.667 --> 21:42.700
but there's something
I want to talk to you about.

21:44.800 --> 21:45.667
What is it?

21:45.734 --> 21:47.233
I want to talk about us.

21:47.734 --> 21:50.600
Rose, even though we've only been dating
for a short period of time,

21:50.667 --> 21:53.967
I feel that our relationship
is starting to get serious.

21:54.433 --> 21:55.967
I feel the same way.

21:56.033 --> 21:58.367
I want you to know I care for you a lot,

21:58.433 --> 22:01.900
but there's a problem
we cannot continue to ignore.

22:02.367 --> 22:04.633
Rose, in order for a relationship
to be complete,

22:04.700 --> 22:08.500
each person has to accept the other
for what he is.

22:09.533 --> 22:11.934
I don't think that can ever happen
between us.

22:12.834 --> 22:15.033
Jonathan, you're wrong.

22:15.100 --> 22:16.500
I can accept you.

22:17.033 --> 22:19.233
I've had time to think this thing through,

22:19.300 --> 22:23.633
and I can honestly say
it doesn't bother me that you're small.

22:24.233 --> 22:25.734
Small? No.

22:26.200 --> 22:29.300
I meant I can't see you anymore
because you're not Jewish.

22:37.934 --> 22:38.667
What?

22:38.734 --> 22:41.100
Rose, this has been
a very difficult decision for me.

22:41.166 --> 22:43.166
You're dumping me because I'm not Jewish?

22:43.233 --> 22:46.734
No. Please understand,
I come from a very religious family.

22:46.800 --> 22:48.200
I can't believe this.

22:48.266 --> 22:50.333
I've been agonizing
over this relationship,

22:50.400 --> 22:53.100
-and now you have the nerve to--
-Rose, please lower your voice.

22:53.166 --> 22:54.500
People are staring at you.

22:54.967 --> 22:57.200
Staring at me? They're staring at you.

22:58.934 --> 23:01.600
Well, yes, but I'm used to it.
I'm a very snappy dresser.

23:04.000 --> 23:08.400
(laughs)

23:10.066 --> 23:14.033
I'm sorry I did that. I guess I was upset.

23:14.100 --> 23:15.567
I understand.

23:16.233 --> 23:19.433
I guess this has been a difficult
relationship for both of us.

23:20.066 --> 23:22.233
Oh, it's been a wonderful relationship.

23:23.100 --> 23:24.300
I'm gonna miss you.

23:24.367 --> 23:26.633
I'm gonna miss you, too, Rose.

23:27.333 --> 23:28.266
How was the shrimp?

23:31.100 --> 23:33.066
Unfortunately, I'll never know.

23:34.467 --> 23:37.367
You see, he's Jewish,
and we can't see each other anymore.

23:41.233 --> 23:44.233
(romantic music playing)

23:49.567 --> 23:52.567
(closing theme music playing)
