WEBVTT

00:03.628 --> 00:06.922
Hey, so this isn't
matching up with this

00:07.007 --> 00:08.465
and I'm not sure
which one is right

00:08.550 --> 00:10.175
Can you just hunt down
the original for me?

00:10.260 --> 00:11.760
Yes, me do

00:11.845 --> 00:13.512
All right

00:18.143 --> 00:20.519
Hey, KevKev, what were you saying
before about the paperwork?

00:21.229 --> 00:24.440
Me do it now.
Go. Stop worry

00:25.483 --> 00:26.859
Kevin, do you feel okay?

00:26.943 --> 00:30.863
Me feel good. Body strong
Sleep big last night

00:30.947 --> 00:32.363
Yeah, I think we should
get him to the hospital.

00:32.448 --> 00:33.824
Yeah, all right, Kev
why don't you come with us?

00:33.908 --> 00:35.534
No, he's fine.
- No, no, guys He's fine.

00:35.702 --> 00:36.702
He's always
been like that

00:36.786 --> 00:37.828
No, he hasn't

00:37.912 --> 00:40.581
I mean, he's gotten worse
over the years, but

00:40.665 --> 00:41.915
He's making a statement

00:42.000 --> 00:44.168
It's an ironic comment
on our expectations of him

00:44.794 --> 00:47.671
A funhouse image of
our model of Kevin.

00:47.881 --> 00:49.465
You keep think that

00:49.799 --> 00:52.176
Me mechanic
not speak English

00:52.260 --> 00:55.637
but he know what me mean
when me say, "Car no go.'

00:55.722 --> 00:57.222
And we best friends

00:57.307 --> 01:02.144
So me think why waste time say
lot word when few word do trick.

01:03.063 --> 01:05.773
Kevin, I appreciate
what you're trying to do

01:05.857 --> 01:06.899
Thank

01:07.400 --> 01:10.069
Here we have
a word code

01:10.153 --> 01:11.570
Same way we have
a dress code.

01:11.654 --> 01:14.198
And what we're
talking about is

01:15.075 --> 01:19.161
basically the speech equivalent
to just wearing underpants

01:20.330 --> 01:24.208
Sometimes words
you no need use

01:25.627 --> 01:27.878
but need need
for talk talk.

01:28.505 --> 01:30.923
But save time.
More success

01:31.007 --> 01:33.884
Does it save time, though? Because
we've been here for about an hour

01:33.968 --> 01:35.219
No me fault

01:36.096 --> 01:40.140
Kevin, at most you're saving
a microscopic amount of time

01:41.559 --> 01:44.144
Many small time
make big time.

01:44.854 --> 01:46.313
What are you going to
do with all this time?

01:46.731 --> 01:48.065
See world

01:48.149 --> 01:50.776
Kevin, you can't possibly save
enough time to see the world

01:50.860 --> 01:54.446
Kevin, are you saying "see
the world' or SeaWorld?

01:54.531 --> 01:59.618
See world Oceans. Fish Jump.
China.

01:59.702 --> 02:02.996
No, see? Right there that's
the problem with your method

02:03.081 --> 02:06.083
because I still don't know if you're
saying SeaWorld or <<see the world.'

02:06.167 --> 02:07.709
And it's taking a lot
of time to explain it

02:08.836 --> 02:11.672
Fine,
fine, I'll talk normally

02:12.590 --> 02:15.717
When me president
they see

02:17.720 --> 02:18.762
They see

02:20.000 --> 02:26.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:52.046 --> 02:57.217
This week we are rolling out the
brand new Sabre tablet, the Pyramid.

02:57.302 --> 02:59.052
Why is it
shaped like that?

02:59.137 --> 03:02.598
So you can tell your clients
"Unleash the power of the pyramid

03:02.974 --> 03:04.725
It's huge
How much does it weigh?

03:04.809 --> 03:06.518
Oh, no, no, no
Without the battery pack

03:06.603 --> 03:08.896
and the optional memory
booster, it's barely 3 pounds

03:08.980 --> 03:10.564
How much memory does it
have without the booster?

03:10.648 --> 03:11.773
Fifty L

03:12.066 --> 03:13.358
I'm sorry, "L"?
- Mmm-hmm

03:13.443 --> 03:14.693
How many I to a K?

03:14.819 --> 03:16.111
DWIGHT You're really going
to want the booster.

03:16.196 --> 03:17.237
How on earth are
we supposed to sell

03:17.322 --> 03:18.363
I'll take five

03:18.698 --> 03:20.866
Andy, don't make us
sell this stupid thing

03:20.950 --> 03:22.451
Oh, no, no, no, no, no
This is Dwight's meeting

03:22.535 --> 03:24.494
Thank you. The
I just wanted to pop in

03:24.579 --> 03:27.122
and get your opinions
on ties and tie clips.

03:27.457 --> 03:29.208
Which combo do you think
Robert's going to like more?

03:29.292 --> 03:30.459
What do you think, C-Span?

03:33.254 --> 03:34.213
"C-Span"?

03:34.297 --> 03:36.381
Yeah, C-Span.
Cocker spaniel

03:36.966 --> 03:38.967
Spaniel because of your Spanish
bloodline Cocker because

03:42.055 --> 03:44.765
Is this really the best use
of our collective time?

03:44.849 --> 03:47.726
I am still forming a first
impression with Robert

03:47.810 --> 03:50.229
Once it is formed
we can all relax, okay?

03:50.313 --> 03:53.649
I'm sorry to hijack your meeting,
D-Dub-Dog, had to pull rank

03:56.861 --> 03:59.446
Okay, let's look
at some ties.

04:00.114 --> 04:02.157
Here's how I'm going to
help out from now on.

04:02.242 --> 04:03.784
I'm going to not care

04:03.868 --> 04:05.661
And I'm going to
sit around quietly

04:05.745 --> 04:07.996
waiting for Andy's
inevitable demise

04:09.207 --> 04:10.457
Your friend
Neil Patrick Harris

04:10.541 --> 04:12.251
really made me laugh
the other night.

04:12.335 --> 04:14.002
D Dog, you have a message

04:14.170 --> 04:15.837
Erin, you don't
need to call him that

04:15.964 --> 04:17.923
Andy wants us to, P Dog

04:18.007 --> 04:19.675
It's okay, E Dog
Who called?

04:19.801 --> 04:21.510
Justine. She said
she's coming by later

04:22.136 --> 04:23.303
Your ex-wife?

04:23.388 --> 04:24.763
Wait, I thought
she was a *

04:24.847 --> 04:26.556
and you *
hated her guts

04:27.725 --> 04:29.643
No, no, no, I like her

04:29.727 --> 04:31.603
Well, I was just
quoting you

04:31.688 --> 04:33.855
I would never say that about her.
I don't know the woman

04:34.232 --> 04:37.734
No, man. We get
along now real well

04:37.819 --> 04:39.611
All right
Can't wait to meet her

04:39.696 --> 04:41.196
I'll introduce you

04:41.281 --> 04:43.490
Yeah, we had a few fights
I suppose

04:43.574 --> 04:46.159
but last night we put
a lot of that to bed.

04:46.244 --> 04:49.538
I can't tell you what I did
with my ex-wife last night

04:50.790 --> 04:51.999
I have to sing it

04:52.083 --> 04:53.959
We took a shower

04:54.043 --> 04:55.836
We were naked

04:56.337 --> 04:57.337
We...

05:07.974 --> 05:08.974
Oh

05:10.101 --> 05:12.436
Hi, Dad. I
Oh, boy.

05:14.188 --> 05:16.064
Hello, Andy
Excellent tie

05:16.858 --> 05:19.234
Would you be requiring a cold
beverage while you're here?

05:19.319 --> 05:20.986
I'd love some coffee

05:21.904 --> 05:25.615
I was looking over your projections
and I think we can do better

05:25.700 --> 05:31.288
Are you factoring in the whole national
economy declining and all that?

05:31.372 --> 05:33.165
Andy, do you know
why I chose you?

05:33.249 --> 05:35.417
I think I can sum it up
with what I think

05:35.501 --> 05:37.627
is your favorite
ice cream flavor

05:38.755 --> 05:39.755
Vanilla?

05:39.881 --> 05:40.964
Vanilla? No

05:42.091 --> 05:44.885
You'll never guess in a million
billion years you'll never guess

05:45.636 --> 05:49.139
You were saying you chose me
There was a reason

05:50.767 --> 05:54.519
Andy, can you inspire?
Do you have that skill set?

05:56.606 --> 05:59.608
Can I inspire?
I don't know

06:01.319 --> 06:02.611
I don't know

06:03.905 --> 06:05.280
Oh, thank you

06:05.365 --> 06:06.365
Oh, sorry

06:06.449 --> 06:07.991
Yeah, just put it down

06:18.461 --> 06:19.586
Mmm

06:20.880 --> 06:22.839
That is very cold

06:23.466 --> 06:24.716
Yeah, it's old

06:26.260 --> 06:27.260
Why would I

06:27.345 --> 06:28.345
I asked if you
wanted a cold beverage

06:28.429 --> 06:29.638
and you said coffee

06:30.473 --> 06:34.017
Why don't we get Robert a nice, hot,
fresh cup and I will have this.

06:34.102 --> 06:35.435
Andy, you don't
want that.

06:35.520 --> 06:37.979
I've been craving a
freezing cup of old coffee.

06:38.147 --> 06:39.231
Mmm

06:39.440 --> 06:40.440
Sorry

06:42.819 --> 06:43.860
You like her

06:46.322 --> 06:47.614
I do. Yeah

06:47.698 --> 06:48.990
She likes you

06:49.158 --> 06:51.952
You know, we've both been into
each other at different times

06:52.036 --> 06:53.703
and just never
really synced up

06:54.080 --> 06:55.831
Now we're in this weird
dance and now we're...

06:55.915 --> 06:57.707
I'm afraid you've
lost my interest

07:00.128 --> 07:01.586
Let me call you back

07:01.671 --> 07:02.754
I got to go

07:07.301 --> 07:09.386
If the office superstore
was supposed to

07:09.470 --> 07:11.763
put us little suppliers
out of business

07:11.848 --> 07:13.348
why are we still here?

07:16.269 --> 07:18.103
Yeah
This is where we go.

07:18.438 --> 07:21.189
You'd go someplace else That's
not it That's not the answer.

07:21.441 --> 07:23.358
It's a answer.
It's a wrong answer

07:23.443 --> 07:24.818
There are no wrong answers

07:24.902 --> 07:26.570
Take a look
at where you are

07:27.196 --> 07:32.367
Where you once worked in a dying
industry, you now work at its birth

07:33.161 --> 07:37.372
Those superstores
are terrified of us.

07:37.957 --> 07:39.124
Anybody know why?

07:41.294 --> 07:42.627
Wait, they're terrified?

07:42.712 --> 07:45.547
Let me tell you how I buy
something these days

07:45.756 --> 07:48.467
I know what I want, I go on the
Internet and get the best price

07:48.551 --> 07:54.139
Or I don't know what I want and I go
to a small store that can help me

07:54.557 --> 07:58.560
The era of personal service
is back You are back.

07:58.895 --> 08:02.481
You'll find that customers
will pay our higher prices

08:02.565 --> 08:04.107
and then they w
thank us

08:04.609 --> 08:07.194
and we will say to them
"You are welcome."

08:12.450 --> 08:13.658
Thank you

08:13.743 --> 08:14.910
Ooh

08:16.329 --> 08:19.831
Andrew, I chose you for a
reason Lead these people.

08:19.916 --> 08:22.834
Show me the best numbers
this place has ever seen.

08:22.919 --> 08:26.379
Last quarter we saw
4% growth. Double it

08:26.923 --> 08:27.923
You got it
Double.

08:28.007 --> 08:29.007
Done
I'm not kidding.

08:29.091 --> 08:30.258
Neither am I
It's already done

08:31.928 --> 08:32.969
I'm just kidding

08:32.970 --> 08:34.679
It's going to take some time.
Double

08:41.938 --> 08:42.938
Hey

08:55.159 --> 08:56.743
What's up, guys?

08:57.286 --> 08:59.663
Just thought we'd have
a little rap session.

08:59.747 --> 09:02.624
Talk about business.
See how things are going

09:06.295 --> 09:07.420
Why don't you start?

09:07.505 --> 09:08.880
If no one else wants to

09:09.632 --> 09:12.801
I was just thinking about
Robert Man, what a boss.

09:13.970 --> 09:16.596
Just throws down goals
you know?

09:16.681 --> 09:19.182
Anyway, how's the sales
doubling project going?

09:19.267 --> 09:20.600
Yeah, how are we
supposed to do that?

09:20.685 --> 09:22.394
We can't just
press a magic button

09:22.478 --> 09:24.771
Of course not.
There's no magic button

09:24.855 --> 09:28.066
You have to summon that

09:28.150 --> 09:31.069
If we could just double our
sales, we already would have

09:31.153 --> 09:32.571
You're not
making any sense

09:32.697 --> 09:34.155
He brings up
two good points

09:34.490 --> 09:37.993
Do you have any new leads? And new
territories you want us to look into?

09:38.369 --> 09:39.995
Maybe have an in
with a big client

09:40.079 --> 09:41.663
that we could get
our foot in the door?

09:42.623 --> 09:43.748
Dwight, anything?

09:44.375 --> 09:46.793
We could talk about
how fast children grow up

09:46.877 --> 09:48.670
and before you know it
they're out of the house

09:48.754 --> 09:52.215
You know what? We need to get
our heads out of the box

09:52.300 --> 09:54.050
If we did have something

09:55.261 --> 09:57.637
what would it look like?
What would it be?

09:57.722 --> 09:58.805
Tuna

09:58.889 --> 10:00.932
New leads, new
territory to look into

10:01.017 --> 10:02.350
maybe an in with
a big company

10:02.435 --> 10:04.894
that we could get
our foot in the door

10:06.606 --> 10:07.647
Fart

10:09.692 --> 10:11.026
Good sesh

10:12.361 --> 10:13.862
That leg's asleep

10:17.825 --> 10:18.825
Hello

10:19.827 --> 10:21.328
I'm looking for
Darryl Philbin?

10:21.412 --> 10:22.537
Don't

10:22.622 --> 10:23.747
Oh

10:23.831 --> 10:26.166
You must think... No, I'm
not I'm using the fax

10:26.250 --> 10:27.709
This isn't
No, wait.

10:27.793 --> 10:30.462
I'm not supposed to represent
the company, right?

10:30.546 --> 10:32.005
There's usually
an Erin here, so

10:32.089 --> 10:33.214
Okay

10:34.133 --> 10:35.675
Darryl, a girl

10:37.470 --> 10:41.598
Rub a dub, dub, apricot scrub

10:41.682 --> 10:42.766
What's up, darling?

10:42.892 --> 10:44.643
Everybody
this is Justine

10:45.144 --> 10:46.978
Hi, Justine
- Hello.

10:47.063 --> 10:49.814
This is Jim, Oscar

10:49.899 --> 10:50.857
Hi

10:50.941 --> 10:52.942
Everybody

10:53.277 --> 10:54.444
Kevin

10:58.240 --> 11:00.158
Can we go
someplace private?

11:00.242 --> 11:01.910
Follow me.
I got a space

11:03.287 --> 11:06.581
After you I've been thinking
about you all morning

11:06.666 --> 11:09.376
I don't know what you did
I can barely walk today.

11:14.715 --> 11:16.257
D Bone, there you are

11:16.342 --> 11:19.177
Let me guess
Somebody needs a brownie

11:19.261 --> 11:20.261
Lick the spoon?

11:20.346 --> 11:21.388
No. No. That's okay

11:21.597 --> 11:24.057
I just,
I wanted to ask you about

11:24.141 --> 11:25.517
Is this about
the profits?

11:25.601 --> 11:28.853
Because if it is, I just don't see
the point It's so Wall Street.

11:29.605 --> 11:32.107
I know, right? Yeah

11:33.150 --> 11:34.317
Um

11:35.069 --> 11:36.778
How is everything?

11:37.446 --> 11:39.155
Good.
Really, really good

11:39.240 --> 11:41.241
Must be a tough time
to be a family farm.

11:41.325 --> 11:44.285
It is And beets are not immune

11:44.370 --> 11:47.872
I made some inroads in salad but
heirloom tomatoes are pushing back.

11:48.666 --> 11:50.458
What are you going to
do about that?

11:51.293 --> 11:52.794
I don't know,
what do you mean?

11:52.878 --> 11:54.921
Got to be some way you could
double your beet sales

11:55.005 --> 11:57.966
You wanted the job the job
is yours, just do the job.

12:00.469 --> 12:01.886
And I'll do mine

12:03.973 --> 12:05.140
Walnuts?

12:05.808 --> 12:06.975
No

12:12.606 --> 12:14.023
Have you seen this?

12:14.150 --> 12:15.191
Parenting? Yeah.

12:15.276 --> 12:16.609
This is Cece's
favorite magazine

12:16.694 --> 12:18.319
She loves
the pictures of babies

12:18.404 --> 12:20.613
She looks at it when she's on the
potty and she makes the faces

12:20.698 --> 12:22.115
Have you read it?

12:22.199 --> 12:25.702
Has an adult member of your family
read this particular issue?

12:26.704 --> 12:27.954
I flipped through it

12:28.038 --> 12:30.290
So you saw the article
on the importance of

12:30.374 --> 12:32.584
taking frequent walks
while you're pregnant?

12:32.668 --> 12:34.377
Of course, yeah.
- We know that

12:34.670 --> 12:36.880
I will be taking a morning
walk and an afternoon walk.

12:36.964 --> 12:38.673
Would you like to
join me?

12:38.758 --> 12:39.758
That sounds nice

12:39.842 --> 12:40.842
Great

12:42.303 --> 12:43.845
You have a walking buddy

12:44.346 --> 12:45.555
I do

12:46.223 --> 12:47.599
Thanks for
coming in, guys

12:47.683 --> 12:50.143
You don't have to thank us
for coming in It's our job

12:50.227 --> 12:52.729
Well, I never got thanked
for coming into a meeting

12:52.813 --> 12:54.856
and I always wanted to be, so
I<m going to thank people.

12:55.274 --> 12:56.816
What's under the blanket?

12:57.193 --> 12:59.527
This is what's
under the blanket

13:00.905 --> 13:02.030
We don't get it

13:02.406 --> 13:05.909
These are incentives. It's how
we're going to double growth

13:06.160 --> 13:09.662
Now, you're probably all asking
yourselves "Well, how does this work?'

13:10.039 --> 13:13.500
It seems like a basic reward
system where you give us points

13:13.584 --> 13:15.877
and then we redeem
those points for prizes

13:15.961 --> 13:17.962
You're exactly right
and you get a point

13:18.047 --> 13:20.173
Oh.
Uh, is that a vibrator?

13:20.716 --> 13:21.716
20 points

13:21.801 --> 13:22.884
How does one get a point?

13:22.968 --> 13:24.511
I've outlined
the exact parameters

13:24.595 --> 13:26.137
in an email
so check your spam folders

13:26.222 --> 13:29.724
But basically, you do your
job better you get points.

13:29.809 --> 13:34.145
So collect 15 points and redeem
them for this polar bear.

13:34.438 --> 13:37.440
Why is it all kids' stuff and a vibrator?
It's so gross.

13:37.733 --> 13:39.400
There's lots of stuff

13:39.944 --> 13:42.070
John Irving, collected
works 22 points.

13:42.154 --> 13:48.409
Or you can pool your points and redeem
55 for this maternity shirt. Ahem

13:48.494 --> 13:50.745
How about you want us to
work harder, pay us more.

13:50.830 --> 13:51.830
I can't

13:51.914 --> 13:53.373
This points system
is really insulting.

13:53.582 --> 13:54.624
Ooh

13:54.708 --> 13:57.710
I didn't mean to offend you
and I hope you'll forgive me

13:57.795 --> 14:01.297
because I am very very
"sari." 16 points

14:01.549 --> 14:02.549
That's a tablecloth

14:02.633 --> 14:04.342
What if we went all the
way up to 500 points?

14:04.426 --> 14:05.844
That's a crazy
amount of points

14:05.928 --> 14:07.887
But what if?
Well, what do you want?

14:08.514 --> 14:10.181
I don't know.
For such a crazy number

14:10.266 --> 14:11.641
I'd like
something pretty crazy

14:11.725 --> 14:14.978
All right, for 500 points,
I will wear a dress to work

14:17.022 --> 14:20.441
That's pretty good What
about for 1,000 points?

14:20.526 --> 14:22.527
I'll run naked
through the parking lot

14:22.611 --> 14:24.028
with a donut
on my ding dong

14:25.406 --> 14:26.531
Yeah, you like that?

14:26.782 --> 14:28.950
All right
for 5,000 points

14:29.034 --> 14:31.786
I will let you
tattoo whatever you want

14:31.871 --> 14:34.622
on the stern of
the old S.S. Bernard

14:35.291 --> 14:36.374
No
Really?

14:36.458 --> 14:38.376
All right. All right And
you are totally serious?

14:38.460 --> 14:40.962
Swear to God. Hope to die
Now let's get to work.

14:41.046 --> 14:43.798
Wait, but you did say we
can pool our points right?

14:44.300 --> 14:45.633
In that case

14:45.718 --> 14:47.343
let's get to work, guys
- Yeah!

14:48.387 --> 14:49.888
Let's do it, guys

14:49.972 --> 14:51.139
Good

14:52.933 --> 14:54.976
I can have it to you by the
beginning of next week.

14:55.060 --> 14:56.352
All right
thank you very much

14:57.479 --> 14:59.230
Phyllis, Brachen Auto?

14:59.315 --> 15:01.065
Ask for Donald.
Karen's bananas

15:01.150 --> 15:02.317
Okay

15:03.444 --> 15:04.527
T-Bag-Bone

15:04.653 --> 15:05.737
Andrew

15:05.821 --> 15:07.488
DWIGHT
Hold on, one second

15:08.365 --> 15:11.075
Have you noticed a little bit
of a mood shift around here?

15:11.827 --> 15:13.244
No. I haven't
noticed anything

15:13.329 --> 15:18.917
Really? Because I sat next to Stanley
for years and this is nap time.

15:19.001 --> 15:21.085
Open eye nap time. He balances
the phone on his shoulder

15:21.170 --> 15:22.170
and just powers down

15:22.254 --> 15:23.254
Now look at him

15:23.339 --> 15:26.466
You've got to unleash
the power of the pyramid

15:26.550 --> 15:28.468
I don't know what
to tell you, man

15:29.678 --> 15:32.221
Do you think it has something to
do with that incentive program?

15:32.306 --> 15:34.182
Oh, 100% We all want to
see you tattoo your ass

15:34.433 --> 15:35.516
Uh.

15:36.018 --> 15:38.102
I think people thought I was
kidding when I said that.

15:38.187 --> 15:39.437
No. You definitely
weren't kidding.

15:39.521 --> 15:41.064
That came across
loud and clear.

15:41.148 --> 15:42.732
Oh, by the way,
I want to hand this in

15:42.816 --> 15:43.942
120 points?

15:44.026 --> 15:45.193
Yeah. Big sale

15:45.694 --> 15:48.154
Don't worry about it, though I
don't really care about the points

15:48.238 --> 15:49.906
I would like
a point receipt though

15:49.990 --> 15:52.283
Hey, yes this is Jim Halpert
calling for Donald.

15:52.368 --> 15:54.494
Can you hold on for one second?
Thank you very much

15:54.578 --> 15:57.246
Who talked to
Maggie at Kaufman's?

16:02.461 --> 16:04.963
And I'm back
How are you, sir?

16:06.382 --> 16:09.050
I think you can squeeze a couple
more golf games in, right?

16:09.426 --> 16:12.053
Where's Angela?
Angela, these are yours

16:15.599 --> 16:16.808
Hey, Kevin,
what are you doing?

16:16.892 --> 16:18.059
Don't talk to me

16:25.150 --> 16:26.234
Yeah

16:27.319 --> 16:30.071
Hi. Professor Frank
Andy Bernard, class of '95

16:30.572 --> 16:35.451
Hey there, I'm a huge fan of
your management book Management.

16:35.536 --> 16:38.830
Uh, quick question I may
be missing a chapter here:

16:38.914 --> 16:41.666
"De-incentivizing."
What are your strategies?

16:41.750 --> 16:43.418
I'm looking for
a real blow to morale

16:44.420 --> 16:45.586
Uh, why?

16:46.380 --> 16:47.672
Well, um

16:48.257 --> 16:49.674
I guess you could say
I'm in one of those

16:49.758 --> 16:52.552
classic ass-tattoo-incentive
situations.

17:03.522 --> 17:05.106
Took 'em one day

17:05.398 --> 17:06.858
Are you ready?

17:10.487 --> 17:12.113
I like it. I like it

17:15.784 --> 17:18.618
Okay, keep in mind, it's not too
late to choose another prize

17:18.704 --> 17:21.705
and there are some
great new additions

17:21.790 --> 17:24.791
My car.
For 1,000 points

17:25.294 --> 17:26.294
Or best offer

17:26.377 --> 17:27.377
What else you got?

17:27.546 --> 17:29.338
Oh, and then this
was Phyllis' idea.

17:29.465 --> 17:30.631
Oh
Oh!

17:32.009 --> 17:33.426
So nasty, Phyllis

17:33.510 --> 17:34.635
Oh, my God

17:39.016 --> 17:41.684
We were hoping you could
do something like this

17:42.603 --> 17:43.895
So coming out of
his butt is a

17:43.979 --> 17:44.937
Baby

17:45.022 --> 17:46.647
Baby.
Yes

17:46.899 --> 17:48.274
Yeah. No problem

17:49.818 --> 17:53.237
We should think about this Does
anyone have any better ideas?

17:53.322 --> 17:54.864
I like what we have

17:55.282 --> 17:56.491
Yeah, nice try

17:56.575 --> 17:58.076
It's pretty edgy

18:01.330 --> 18:03.122
I just need
a second outside

18:11.507 --> 18:13.007
You getting psyched up?
Yeah.

18:13.092 --> 18:15.051
Andy, nobody really expects
you to go through with this.

18:15.177 --> 18:17.845
Toons, what am I
doing here?

18:19.765 --> 18:21.390
Why did Robert pick me?

18:22.142 --> 18:24.644
Confession, I don't
know what I'm doing

18:25.187 --> 18:26.813
I mean
do you like it?

18:27.606 --> 18:28.898
You having fun?

18:30.526 --> 18:32.944
I'll tell you this everybody
else is having a lot of fun

18:33.445 --> 18:35.154
And you did that

18:35.864 --> 18:38.574
My ass is only so big. I mean
I can't do this every day

18:38.659 --> 18:40.284
But I think it's big enough
to buy you some time

18:40.369 --> 18:41.953
until your next
great idea.

18:42.037 --> 18:44.580
Which, by the way
I can't wait for

18:48.293 --> 18:50.461
No one expects me to go
through with this, right?

18:50.546 --> 18:51.879
Absolutely not

18:56.510 --> 18:58.845
Let's ink my stink

19:00.055 --> 19:01.305
Yeah

19:01.890 --> 19:06.352
My heart belongs to music but
my ass belongs to these people

19:07.980 --> 19:09.313
Whoa

19:11.108 --> 19:12.692
Do your worst

19:15.154 --> 19:17.196
Uh, you can keep your
pants on actually

19:17.281 --> 19:19.574
If you just drop them down
a bit that'd be great.

19:19.658 --> 19:21.159
They are already off
my good sir.

19:21.243 --> 19:23.077
I'd really prefer
they not be down

19:23.162 --> 19:26.664
Well, I think down's better
Sweating pretty heavily down there

19:31.587 --> 19:33.546
Do you think you
could work from this?

19:33.630 --> 19:35.006
We made some
small adjustments

19:35.090 --> 19:36.132
Okay, you want me to

19:36.216 --> 19:37.508
Just those few adjustments Yeah.

19:38.760 --> 19:40.052
All right.
Let's begin

19:40.137 --> 19:41.888
This is where I grin
and bear Ow, ow!

19:41.972 --> 19:43.014
That was just
a cotton swab

19:43.098 --> 19:45.183
Invest in
softer cotton, sir

19:50.147 --> 19:51.272
Ow

19:55.611 --> 19:56.611
Oh

19:57.779 --> 20:00.281
Obviously you can go
the ass tattoo route

20:00.365 --> 20:02.783
and obviously I'm
going to like it.

20:03.035 --> 20:05.036
Draw some blood
Ha-ha!

20:13.879 --> 20:16.714
Why did I choose
Andy to run the office?

20:17.090 --> 20:21.636
Because he's all surface, uncomplicated.
What you see is what you get.

20:22.262 --> 20:25.223
It could be a recipe
for mediocrity, yes.

20:25.307 --> 20:27.808
But then again, it might just
be why people fight for him.

20:30.729 --> 20:32.897
It's a Nard dog

20:34.191 --> 20:36.150
That's my nickity name

20:37.694 --> 20:38.986
I love it. I love it

20:39.071 --> 20:40.321
Pull up your pants

20:41.114 --> 20:43.699
There's something
about an underdog

20:43.784 --> 20:46.994
that really
inspires the unexceptional

20:50.666 --> 20:52.625
Um, what should we
talk about?

20:53.210 --> 20:56.087
Well, we could talk about an
ethical dilemma I'm having.

20:56.171 --> 20:58.673
Oh, yeah, sure
I hope I can help

20:59.091 --> 21:01.926
A coworker of mine is drinking
caffeine while pregnant

21:02.010 --> 21:04.762
and I don't know if I should
call social services about it

21:04.846 --> 21:06.514
Angela, that's
pretty transparently me

21:07.015 --> 21:08.182
Maybe

21:08.684 --> 21:10.559
You know
it's just herbal tea

21:10.644 --> 21:13.062
In mugs with trace
amounts of coffee

21:14.022 --> 21:16.524
Yeah. I think you
should call social services

21:16.608 --> 21:17.650
I already did

21:19.778 --> 21:22.113
You know, maybe we should
just have our own pregnancies

21:22.197 --> 21:24.490
and not pretend like
we're in this together

21:24.574 --> 21:26.701
