HAVE FRIENDS IN HIGH SCHOOL,

JOE HARDLY KNEW I EXISTED.

17:04.500 --> 17:06.458
JOE WAS CAPTAIN OF
THE SCHOOL FOOTBALL TEAM.

17:06.458 --> 17:08.375
A REAL BRUISER ON THE FIELD.

17:08.375 --> 17:12.291

17:22.166 --> 17:25.750
SHE WAS FOUND DEAD THREE
YEARS AGO, AN APPARENT SUICIDE.

17:25.750 --> 17:29.250
BUT THERE WAS BLOOD
UNDERNEATH HER FINGERNAILS.

17:29.250 --> 17:31.041
HOW COULD IT GET THERE

17:31.041 --> 17:32.709
IF HER FINGERS WERE
WRAPPED AROUND THE GRIP,

17:32.709 --> 17:34.542
POINTING AWAY FROM HER BODY?

17:34.542 --> 17:36.208
IT MUST BELONG TO
SOMEONE ELSE.

17:36.208 --> 17:39.250
PERHAPS SOMEONE SHE SCRATCHED
WHILE PUTTING UP A FIGHT.

17:46.417 --> 17:49.417

WILL BE AT THE REUNION TONIGHT.

A HIGHER POWER--IN A GOD--

48:48.625 --> 48:49.959
WITH WHAT YOU'VE DONE?

48:49.959 --> 48:52.250
- WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE?

48:52.250 --> 48:53.750
- I'M JUST CURIOUS.

48:53.750 --> 48:56.875
- SO WHAT, I'M SUPPOSED
TO DEFEND MY BELIEFS TO YOU?

48:56.875 --> 48:59.375
- IF YOU DON'T MIND.

48:59.375 --> 49:03.500
- LOOK, I MEAN,
EVERYONE MAKES MISTAKES.

49:03.500 --> 49:06.917
AND...THEY DO THINGS
THAT THEY SHOULDN'T DO.

49:06.917 --> 49:08.542
AND THEY'RE ONLY HUMAN.

49:08.542 --> 49:11.000
BUT GOD--
SEE, GOD FORGIVES US.

49:11.000 --> 49:12.750
- REALLY,
IT'S AS SIMPLE AS THAT?

49:12.750 --> 49:14.583
YOU KILL SOMEONE,
GOD FORGIVES YOU FOR IT?

49:14.583 --> 49:15.917
- YES.
- SO I COULD KILL YOU

49:15.917 --> 49:17.375
AND GOD WOULD FORGIVE ME?
- WELL, NO.

49:17.375 --> 49:21.542
- YOU JUST SAID HE WOULD.
- YOU HAVE TO TRULY REPENT.

49:21.542 --> 49:24.083
- DO YOU TRULY
REPENT FOR KILLING JANET?

49:24.083 --> 49:26.291
- YES, DEFINITELY.
- LIAR.

49:26.291 --> 49:27.792
- NO, NO,
YOU DON'T WANNA DO THAT!

49:27.792 --> 49:30.250
- WHY IS THAT?
- 'CAUSE...

49:30.250 --> 49:33.125
IF YOU LET ME GO, GOD
WILL GIVE YOU LIFE EVERLASTING,

49:33.125 --> 49:35.291
AND WHATEVER YOU WANT.

49:35.291 --> 49:37.834
- EH, THERE'S REALLY
NOTHING I NEED.

49:37.834 --> 49:40.250
- YOU KNOW, YOU DON'T WANNA--

49:40.250 --> 49:42.875
YOU DON'T WANNA--
YOU DON'T WANNA MAKE GOD MAD.

49:42.875 --> 49:44.625
- DON'T YOU HEAR
HOW FOOLISH YOU SOUND?

49:44.625 --> 49:45.792
- BECAUSE HE WILL SMITE YOU

49:45.792 --> 49:48.959
WITH SWORDS,
AND ROCKS, AND THUNDER.

49:48.959 --> 49:50.917
- EHHH,
THUNDER IS JUST THE NOISE.

49:50.917 --> 49:52.583
IT WOULD BE LIGHTNING.

49:52.583 --> 49:54.667
- YOU CANNOT KILL ME
FOR GOD IS A MIGHTY FORTRESS.

49:54.667 --> 49:55.959
- JOE, PLEASE, STOP.

49:55.959 --> 49:57.500
- AND I HAVE BEEN WASHED
WITH THE BLOOD OF THE LAMB,

49:57.500 --> 49:59.625
AND HE WILL PROTECT ME--

49:59.625 --> 50:03.834
[thud]

50:03.834 --> 50:07.000
SORRY.
HAMMER TIME.

50:11.000 --> 50:13.542
- SO I TALKED TO
THE COAST GUARD TODAY,

50:13.542 --> 50:15.625
AND THEY CONFIRMED
WHAT WE'D ALREADY FIGURED.

50:15.625 --> 50:17.834
WITH THE TIDES AND ALL THAT,
THAT BODY WAS PROBABLY

50:17.834 --> 50:22.500
TOSSED IN THE WATER NO MORE
THAN A QUARTER MILE OFF SHORE.

50:22.500 --> 50:23.542
- REALLY?

50:23.542 --> 50:25.667
- YOU DON'T
SEEM VERY INTERESTED.

50:25.667 --> 50:27.458
- NO,
OF COURSE I'M INTERESTED.

50:27.458 --> 50:29.917
I-I-I JUST, UM...

50:29.917 --> 50:31.667
DON'T REALLY
WANNA TALK ABOUT WORK.

50:31.667 --> 50:33.959
- WHAT IS GOING ON WITH YOU?
YOU'RE ACTING SO WEIRD LATELY.

50:33.959 --> 50:35.333
- I'M NOT ACTING WEIRD, I--

50:35.333 --> 50:40.166
- YOU'RE ABOUT
TO DRINK THE CANDLE.

50:40.166 --> 50:43.125
- I'M JUST GONNA USE
THE RESTROOM.

50:54.083 --> 50:56.709
DEBRA...

50:56.709 --> 51:00.083
WILL YOU MARRY ME?

51:00.083 --> 51:04.250
GOD, I SOUND
LIKE A FUCKING IDIOT.

51:04.250 --> 51:05.375
[clears throat]

51:05.375 --> 51:08.750
- THANK YOU.

51:08.750 --> 51:11.667
[gunfire]
- GET DOWN, GET DOWN, GET DOWN!

51:11.667 --> 51:17.500
[gunfire, screams]

51:20.208 --> 51:22.875
- FUCK!
HE'S WEARING KEVLAR.

51:22.875 --> 51:24.417
[screams]

51:24.417 --> 51:25.875
[gunfire]

51:25.875 --> 51:28.583
- [groans]

51:28.583 --> 51:30.041
[phone camera clicks]

51:30.041 --> 51:31.417
- [groans]

51:31.417 --> 51:34.458
- [grunts]

51:34.458 --> 51:36.417
- DON'T FUCKIN' MOVE!

51:36.417 --> 51:37.583
- YOU ALL RIGHT?

51:37.583 --> 51:41.417
- YEAH.

51:41.417 --> 51:44.417
[camera clicks]

51:44.417 --> 51:47.250
- LIFE IS GOOD.

51:47.250 --> 51:49.000
I'M NOT AT ALL UNHAPPY.

51:49.000 --> 51:51.083
I'M QUITE CONTENT
TO GO ABOUT MY LIFE

51:51.083 --> 51:53.583
BELIEVING IN NOTHING.

51:53.583 --> 51:56.458
WITH NO FEAR THAT THERE MIGHT BE
SOMETHING MORE OUT THERE.

52:00.083 --> 52:03.250
- "I STOOD UPON
THE SAND OF THE SEA,

52:03.250 --> 52:06.709
"AND I SAW A SERPENT
RISE UP OUT OF THE SEA,

52:06.709 --> 52:09.166
HAVING SEVEN HEADS."

52:09.166 --> 52:12.166
- "AND UPON THESE HEADS,
THE NAME OF BLASPHEMY."

52:15.625 --> 52:17.166
SO IT'S BEGUN?

52:17.166 --> 52:20.750
- YES.
IT'S BEGUN.

52:23.583 --> 52:27.083
[chuckles]

52:27.083 --> 52:29.166
- BUT I ALSO HAVE A SON.

52:29.166 --> 52:30.875
AND I HAVE TO THINK ABOUT
WHAT HE WANTS

52:30.875 --> 52:32.625
AND WHAT'S BEST FOR HIM,

52:32.625 --> 52:34.125
BECAUSE WHO KNOWS?

52:34.125 --> 52:35.709
MAYBE HE'LL
GROW UP TO BE SOMEONE

52:35.709 --> 52:37.291
WHO WANTS TO THINK ABOUT...

52:37.291 --> 52:40.166
THOSE KINDS OF THINGS.
