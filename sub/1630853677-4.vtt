09:21.812 --> 09:23.814
there's probably carpeting underneath.

09:24.815 --> 09:26.483
Alright. Should be good.

09:26.483 --> 09:29.778
Just open it extremely slowly
and don't close it unless you have to.

09:30.237 --> 09:31.697
Isn't she great?

09:31.697 --> 09:33.156
She loves fixing things.

09:33.156 --> 09:35.367
I call her the Maria-cle Worker.

09:36.493 --> 09:38.453
Even though she can see and she can hear.

09:38.453 --> 09:40.414
Well, thanks so much.

09:40.414 --> 09:41.290
Yeah, thank you.

09:41.290 --> 09:44.501
- We truly could not have
this dinner without you guys.

09:44.501 --> 09:47.004
Oh, sure you could.

09:47.004 --> 09:49.256
I mean, you don't need us
around for dinner.

09:49.256 --> 09:50.132
Jack, don't be rude.

09:50.132 --> 09:52.676
If they're inviting us for dinner,
we should stay.

09:53.927 --> 09:55.345
You're staying for dinner?

09:55.345 --> 09:57.431
We would love to.

09:59.183 --> 10:00.225
Yes.

10:00.225 --> 10:01.810
♪

10:09.735 --> 10:10.861
Thank you.

10:10.861 --> 10:13.155
So according to this influencer I hate,

10:13.155 --> 10:15.490
this is supposed to be
the best pan-Asian spot in town.

10:15.490 --> 10:19.286
- Cool. I wonder what part of Asia
executive chef Keith O'Reilly is from.

10:19.286 --> 10:20.996
Um, excuse me.

10:21.455 --> 10:23.790
Hi. Real quick. Our menus are blank.

10:23.790 --> 10:25.375
Ah, good eye.

10:25.375 --> 10:28.921
The name of my restaurant, Yùwàng,
actually means desire.

10:28.921 --> 10:31.715
The menus are blank
because I serve only what I desire.

10:31.715 --> 10:32.591
Ah.

10:32.591 --> 10:33.967
- The cuisine is all based
on the time I've spent

10:33.967 --> 10:35.886
in several American Chinatowns.

10:35.886 --> 10:37.513
So you've never been out of the country?

10:37.513 --> 10:38.347
No, no, I misspoke.

10:38.347 --> 10:40.098
I've been to
the Toronto Chinatown as well.

10:40.474 --> 10:41.808
- Oh.
- Ah.

10:41.808 --> 10:42.851
<i>Bon appetit.</i>

10:43.602 --> 10:44.561
This is so fun.

10:44.561 --> 10:46.063
- It's, like, so fun, right?
- Yeah. Yeah.

10:46.897 --> 10:48.357
I have to make a quick phone call.

10:48.357 --> 10:49.441
Probably take about an hour.

10:49.441 --> 10:50.984
So I'll order you some Mai Tais,

10:50.984 --> 10:53.320
and you guys just start connecting
or whatever.

10:53.320 --> 10:54.446
- Mai Tais?
Yeah.

10:54.446 --> 10:57.115
- Yeah, that's sort of our drink
when we're looking to have some fun.

10:57.115 --> 11:00.786
- Oh, how much fun are you looking
to have exactly?

11:00.786 --> 11:02.538
- Oh, Amy's got a whole plan
for us tonight,

11:02.538 --> 11:04.706
and she specifically wanted
to include you.

11:04.706 --> 11:05.749
Really?

11:05.749 --> 11:09.253
- Yeah. I'm just grateful that she didn't,
uh, pick a complete stranger.

11:09.253 --> 11:12.256
I wouldn't put it past her
to look on Craigslist for someone.

11:13.048 --> 11:13.924
What?

11:13.924 --> 11:15.759
- Sorry, I-- Sorry, I should explain.

11:16.343 --> 11:18.470
She walked in on me on my laptop
and got worried

11:18.470 --> 11:20.556
because she saw me getting something
from another person

11:20.556 --> 11:21.682
that I can't get from her.

11:21.682 --> 11:25.227
Right. Another person, like a woman?

11:25.227 --> 11:27.229
- Women. Men. My cousin.
Your drinks.

11:27.229 --> 11:28.605
- Your cousin?
- Yeah.

11:28.605 --> 11:30.357
I'll take that. Yeah. Thanks.

11:30.941 --> 11:31.817
Oh.

11:31.817 --> 11:33.235
A boozer.

11:40.826 --> 11:42.786
What a lovely arrangement.

11:42.786 --> 11:43.912
Yeah.

11:44.580 --> 11:46.832
You know, there's a place in a strip mall

11:46.832 --> 11:50.169
that actually makes arrangements
that are edible.

11:50.169 --> 11:51.003
Yeah!

11:51.795 --> 11:53.839
- Sit with that.
- Huh?

11:54.464 --> 11:57.467
Well, these flowers are actually
for our anniversary.

11:57.467 --> 11:58.844
Oh my gosh.

11:58.844 --> 12:00.429
It's your anniversary.

12:00.429 --> 12:02.598
How many years are you celebrating?

12:02.598 --> 12:05.392
- We're celebrating the first time
we broke up and got back together.

12:05.392 --> 12:06.894
So not a real anniversary.

12:06.894 --> 12:07.936
Well, that's not true.

12:07.936 --> 12:09.897
We get to decide
what a real anniversary is.

12:09.897 --> 12:12.691
- So maybe we should decide
and not just you.

12:12.691 --> 12:15.694
- Yikes. She just dog walked you,
my friend.

12:17.613 --> 12:20.407
- Folks, uh, these items
that we're eating,

12:20.407 --> 12:21.491
they are really terrific.

12:21.491 --> 12:22.868
What's the sauce?

12:22.868 --> 12:24.036
Uh, chipotle.

12:24.036 --> 12:26.496
Right. Family secret. I, I get it.

12:27.247 --> 12:31.210
- Maybe we should get out
the emotional toolbox

12:31.585 --> 12:34.171
and look under the hood
of these multiple break-ups

12:34.171 --> 12:36.131
and find out what that's about, huh?

12:37.716 --> 12:39.051
Mm.

12:39.051 --> 12:40.219
Hi.

12:40.219 --> 12:43.388
Hi. Um, I was in earlier tonight.

12:43.388 --> 12:45.015
I was the one with the pretty nails

12:45.015 --> 12:46.767
and the gorgeous hair
and the whole outfit.

12:47.976 --> 12:50.854
Oh. Well, I guess you weren't working yet
or you would remember.

12:50.854 --> 12:54.816
Um, I'm calling to see if my husband
and friend are getting along.

12:54.816 --> 12:57.027
You know what? Maybe you could just,
like, scooch by their table

12:57.027 --> 12:59.279
and take a little secret video
and then text it to me

12:59.279 --> 13:00.531
so I know they're doing okay.

13:01.490 --> 13:02.991
How is that an unusual request?

13:02.991 --> 13:04.576
Isn't that literally your job?

13:05.035 --> 13:06.620
Wait, wait, wait. What?

13:07.037 --> 13:10.040
The restaurant made you work
on your birthday.

13:10.040 --> 13:12.167
Ugh. Hosting sounds really hard.

13:12.709 --> 13:14.127
Now it's just a vibe I'm getting,

13:14.628 --> 13:15.838
but are you an Aquarius?

13:16.839 --> 13:19.299
Pisces. Of course.
Of course, you're Pisces.

13:19.299 --> 13:21.468
All the most important people
in my life are Pisces.

13:21.468 --> 13:22.636
You're just like my dentist.

13:23.053 --> 13:25.097
Mm. Wait, you know what?

13:25.430 --> 13:27.766
You would get along so great
with my dentist.

13:27.766 --> 13:29.852
Here, give me your number.

13:30.477 --> 13:32.396
I am going to make this happen.

13:32.396 --> 13:33.355
Woo!

13:36.567 --> 13:37.609
Knock, knock.

13:37.609 --> 13:41.238
- Saying "knock, knock" while entering
doesn't count, Dad.

13:41.238 --> 13:43.198
Well, you're psychic. It's fine.

13:43.657 --> 13:45.909
Listen, honey, do you mind
if I hang out in here for a little bit?

13:45.909 --> 13:46.827
Sure.

13:46.827 --> 13:49.788
- Your mom got us stuck
for dinner with Ben and Jessie.

13:49.788 --> 13:52.374
I don't know why she does that.
She knows how much I hate people.

13:52.374 --> 13:53.709
Ooh, how did you get away?

13:53.709 --> 13:54.877
Well, you know what I did?

13:54.877 --> 13:56.670
I just stood up and I excused myself,

13:56.670 --> 13:58.463
- and I walked up the stairs.
- Huh.

13:58.463 --> 13:59.631
Pretty slick, huh?

13:59.631 --> 14:03.510
- Oh, I guess avoiding people
runs in the family.

14:05.470 --> 14:07.556
- Okay. I may not have heard
what you said,

14:07.556 --> 14:10.225
but I can sense the subtle shifts
in a woman's tone.

14:10.809 --> 14:11.768
What's going on, honey?

14:12.394 --> 14:13.770
Hmm. Well, I had a vision

14:13.770 --> 14:15.731
that I got in a fight tonight
with the guy that I like,

14:15.731 --> 14:18.025
and I was afraid
that he would break things off.

14:18.025 --> 14:19.610
So I canceled on him.

14:19.610 --> 14:20.903
- Uh-huh.
- Hmm.

14:20.903 --> 14:23.906
- So you don't have a destiny
with your date?

14:24.281 --> 14:25.199
Good one, Dad.

14:25.782 --> 14:27.659
Well, what about tomorrow night?

14:28.160 --> 14:28.994
What do you mean?

14:29.786 --> 14:32.164
- Well, I mean,
you can't stay in here forever.

14:32.164 --> 14:34.708
And are you going to avoid
this guy tomorrow night, too?

14:34.708 --> 14:36.752
And the night after that.
And the night after that.

14:36.752 --> 14:39.421
Life is... endless.

14:41.548 --> 14:42.716
- Dad?
- Yes.

14:43.217 --> 14:44.176
I'm here.

14:44.176 --> 14:45.260
Honey, look,

14:45.260 --> 14:50.015
conflict can actually sometimes make
a relationship stronger.

14:51.058 --> 14:53.018
So I think what you need to do
is just jump in

14:53.018 --> 14:55.270
and try this, see what happens.

14:55.270 --> 14:56.647
I don't know how to do that.

14:56.647 --> 14:59.441
- Okay, this is the oldest
Dad advice in the world,

14:59.441 --> 15:01.693
but practice makes perfect.

15:06.323 --> 15:07.533
Thanks, Dad.

15:07.533 --> 15:09.159
Well, you're welcome.

15:09.159 --> 15:10.369
So, where are you going?

15:10.369 --> 15:12.746
I think I have a fight to catch.

15:12.746 --> 15:14.414
Oh, good one.

15:19.086 --> 15:21.088
Oh, good, Jack. Get over here.

15:21.088 --> 15:22.631
Let me fill you in on what you missed.

15:22.631 --> 15:25.092
These two were high school sweethearts.

15:25.092 --> 15:27.469
Cheerleader and mascot. Not who you think.

15:27.469 --> 15:28.971
Three break-ups.

15:28.971 --> 15:32.266
First time living together.
No active cavities between them.

15:32.266 --> 15:34.017
I don't think it's that ridiculous

15:34.017 --> 15:35.310
that I was the cheerleader.

15:35.310 --> 15:36.770
Uh, okay, well, you know what?

15:36.770 --> 15:39.022
It sounds like you guys
covered everything,

15:39.022 --> 15:41.733
so, um, honey, maybe we should get going.

15:41.733 --> 15:44.361
You know, that milkshake place
I love is still open, so let's--

15:44.361 --> 15:45.445
Honey, sit down.

15:45.904 --> 15:47.573
Ben and Jessie were just getting back

15:47.573 --> 15:50.158
to why they would celebrate a breakup.

15:50.158 --> 15:51.410
Oh no.

15:51.827 --> 15:54.997
You see, that's the thing.
We're celebrating getting back together.

15:54.997 --> 15:57.124
Isn't that a nice thing to do?

15:57.124 --> 15:58.917
I know that's where you come from, Ben,

15:58.917 --> 16:01.211
but I come from a place
where anything remotely negative

16:01.211 --> 16:02.546
was swept under the rug.

16:02.546 --> 16:05.382
You see it as celebrating
a bunch of anniversaries,

16:05.382 --> 16:08.427
but I see it as shining a light
on all of our break-ups,

16:08.427 --> 16:09.845
and I don't want to remember that.

16:09.845 --> 16:10.804
Why not?

16:11.263 --> 16:12.431
What do you mean, why not?

16:12.431 --> 16:13.807
Why not? It's our history.

16:13.807 --> 16:15.809
- Because she probably doesn't want it
to happen again.

16:15.809 --> 16:17.102
Maybe. I'm just guessing.

16:19.646 --> 16:20.647
Is that true?

16:21.690 --> 16:22.524
Jessie.

16:23.066 --> 16:24.568
I really don't care about the date.

16:24.568 --> 16:25.611
Honestly.

16:25.611 --> 16:27.696
The reason my family celebrated anything

16:27.696 --> 16:29.865
was because it was
an excuse to be together.

16:30.782 --> 16:32.534
If you want to celebrate
that it's Thursday,

16:32.534 --> 16:35.120
let's celebrate that,
as long as it's you and me.

16:36.246 --> 16:38.040
That's the part I really care about.

16:39.041 --> 16:40.209
Happy Thursday.

16:41.710 --> 16:42.961
- Happier now.
- Yeah?

16:47.674 --> 16:48.800
Alright, Jack.

16:55.724 --> 16:57.476
Oh, I hope I'm not crossing a line.

16:57.851 --> 16:59.144
Amy and I love to share.

17:01.772 --> 17:04.441
- Dave, I think it'd be weird
if we slept together.

17:04.441 --> 17:06.944
- I think it'd be weird too.
Why are we doing that?

17:06.944 --> 17:09.488
Because Amy wants to.

17:09.488 --> 17:10.864
You guys love to share.

17:10.864 --> 17:12.783
Wait. Did you sleep with your cousin?

17:12.783 --> 17:14.535
No. No!

17:14.535 --> 17:15.786
No.

17:15.786 --> 17:16.995
Sorry.

17:16.995 --> 17:18.872
I thought you got what was going on here.

17:19.331 --> 17:21.583
- What's going on?
- Amy wants us to get together

17:21.583 --> 17:23.627
because she wants me
to have more Asian friends.

17:23.627 --> 17:25.587
I can't tell if that's better or worse.

17:25.587 --> 17:26.964
Well, for sure problematic.

17:26.964 --> 17:29.091
But it's coming from
a genuine place of love.

17:29.091 --> 17:32.135
- Hmm.
- She just wants me to feel at home here.

17:32.135 --> 17:33.178
You know?

17:33.178 --> 17:36.515
Have mates with the same
cultural touchstones as I do.

17:36.515 --> 17:38.141
Sorry, what's a cultural touchstone?

17:38.141 --> 17:40.310
- What is a cultural touchstone?
I don't know.

17:41.228 --> 17:43.438
Well, Dave, I'm from Reseda,

17:43.438 --> 17:45.691
so I'm not sure I can relate
to the experiences

17:45.691 --> 17:48.151
of a Korean-Australian-American.

17:49.820 --> 17:52.489
- Well, here's something
we can both relate to.

17:53.156 --> 17:54.575
This place sucks.

17:56.785 --> 17:57.661
Yeah.

17:58.161 --> 17:59.454
- Ugh.
- Let's get out of here.

17:59.454 --> 18:02.499
I know this great dumpling spot
on York. It's always got a line.

18:02.499 --> 18:04.376
- Cash only?
- Oh hell, yeah.

18:04.376 --> 18:06.378
- Hell to the yeah. I'll text Amy.
- Let's go.

18:10.883 --> 18:11.925
- Maggie?
- Hi.

18:11.925 --> 18:12.926
I thought you were sick.

18:12.926 --> 18:14.761
Wow. You look sick.

18:16.972 --> 18:19.099
- I had a vision of us
getting into a fight,

18:19.099 --> 18:22.060
and I wanted to avoid it, so I lied.

18:22.060 --> 18:24.730
And I feel really, really bad about it.

18:25.939 --> 18:27.316
Okay, now you yell at me.

18:27.316 --> 18:29.318
Uh, okay.

18:29.318 --> 18:31.320
Th-that's a lot of information.

18:31.695 --> 18:34.615
- Oh yeah. Take a minute.
We can fight when you're ready.

18:35.991 --> 18:37.659
Why don't you come inside?

18:38.035 --> 18:38.952
Okay.

18:43.790 --> 18:45.834
- You can't just come over here
and say you want to fight.

18:45.834 --> 18:47.836
- No, I don't want to fight.
That's why I canceled on you.

18:47.836 --> 18:49.213
I'm saying we're going to fight.

18:49.213 --> 18:50.589
Okay.

18:50.589 --> 18:53.091
You know, women have canceled
on me a lot, but this,

18:53.091 --> 18:54.426
this is new.

18:54.426 --> 18:57.554
- Yeah, I would definitely
be super annoyed if I were you.

18:57.554 --> 18:59.223
Especially if I had a whole outfit.

18:59.640 --> 19:01.808
Yeah, I also had a whole plan.

19:01.808 --> 19:04.186
The reservation was
for this cool pan-Asian place

19:04.186 --> 19:05.896
with no menus
that we probably wouldn't like.

19:05.896 --> 19:08.273
But I thought it'd be kind of funny,
something that we could bond over.

19:08.273 --> 19:09.775
But then I got your voicemail,
and I thought,

19:09.775 --> 19:11.276
you know, I feel really bad
that she's sick.

19:11.276 --> 19:12.194
I'm going to send her some soup.

19:12.194 --> 19:13.862
And now I just feel
really stupid for caring.

19:13.862 --> 19:15.239
- Well, the only reason
I didn't want to see you

19:15.239 --> 19:16.782
is because I care, too.

19:16.782 --> 19:18.617
- You know that doesn't make
any sense, right?

19:18.617 --> 19:20.911
- Can you just fight with me,
please, Daniel?

19:21.870 --> 19:22.704
Wait.

19:22.704 --> 19:25.249
This is wrong. Were we outside?

19:25.249 --> 19:26.917
- Sorry. Wait, wha-what's outside?

19:26.917 --> 19:29.044
- Th-- Our fight. In, in my vision.

19:29.044 --> 19:31.296
I saw us outside. Should we go outside?

19:31.296 --> 19:32.297
No!

19:32.297 --> 19:35.259
I mean, this is--
Maybe we fight more than once.

19:35.259 --> 19:37.761
- If we're going to do that,
we should just end this right now.

19:37.761 --> 19:39.513
What is happening?

19:39.513 --> 19:42.224
Maggie, people in relationships
fight all the time,

19:42.224 --> 19:43.267
and they don't break up.

19:43.267 --> 19:44.351
It's called having a conflict.

19:44.351 --> 19:46.061
And truthfully,
I think it's kind of healthy.

19:46.061 --> 19:47.479
Wait. Back up a minute.

19:47.479 --> 19:49.690
Are you... are you saying

19:49.690 --> 19:51.942
we're in a relationship?

19:51.942 --> 19:52.985
I mean...

19:55.279 --> 19:56.530
I wouldn't be mad at that.

19:57.447 --> 19:58.282
You?

19:59.408 --> 20:01.201
I wouldn't be mad at that either.

♪

20:06.915 --> 20:08.959
- To be clear,
you're definitely not sick, right?

20:08.959 --> 20:09.960
- No.
- Great.

20:13.881 --> 20:15.799
- Thank you so much
for bringing this home.

20:15.799 --> 20:17.551
I'm glad you and Louise connected.

20:17.551 --> 20:20.387
- You should say next time.
We'd have fun as a threesome.

20:20.387 --> 20:21.471
What's that?

20:23.432 --> 20:26.185
- Okay. I've come up with
a list of other anniversaries

20:26.185 --> 20:27.352
I'd like to celebrate.

20:27.352 --> 20:30.480
- Oh, first time we used
the EpiPen successfully.

20:30.480 --> 20:32.191
- I loved that.
- Aww.

20:32.191 --> 20:33.400
- Aww.
- Great memory.

20:33.400 --> 20:34.568
You know something, honey?

20:34.568 --> 20:37.154
I give those kids about six months max.

20:37.154 --> 20:39.364
Oh, my little romantic.

20:39.364 --> 20:41.867
I really hope Maggie and Daniel made up.

20:41.867 --> 20:43.035
Oh, I'm sure they did.

20:43.035 --> 20:46.997
Maggie knows the family rule.
Never go to your separate beds angry.

20:46.997 --> 20:48.165
That's true.

20:48.165 --> 20:49.041
Mwah!

20:49.541 --> 20:51.460
- Night, sweetie.
- Nighty-night, honey.

20:51.460 --> 20:53.504
-Love you.
-I love you.

20:55.130 --> 20:57.174
<i>Shane, wait, you can't go to Paris.</i>

20:57.758 --> 21:01.094
-<i>Why not?</i>
-<i>Because you're the love of my life.</i>

21:01.970 --> 21:03.805
- You have no idea
how important that just was.

21:03.805 --> 21:04.640
Hmm?
