WEBVTT

01:02.229 --> 01:03.232
Time.

01:04.360 --> 01:07.537
Time, it has been proposed
is the fourth dimension.

01:09.168 --> 01:12.554
And yet, for mortal man,
time has no dimension at all.

01:14.142 --> 01:19.451
We are like horses with blinders
seeing only what lies before us.

01:20.663 --> 01:23.506
Forever guessing the future...

01:24.174 --> 01:26.515
...and fabricating the past.

01:28.437 --> 01:30.945
- Brilliant.
- Quite right, Your Grace.

01:31.113 --> 01:37.173
How, you ask, can we lift these shackles
and live not in the moment..

01:37.257 --> 01:41.145
...but in the glorious expanse
of time's continuum?

01:44.195 --> 01:46.620
Listen, and I shall tell you.

01:48.125 --> 01:53.016
The secret lies in the enduring
power of our achievements...

01:53.184 --> 01:55.566
- Yes!
- ...our creations!

01:58.240 --> 02:01.585
As the pyramids testify to the Egyptians...

02:01.669 --> 02:05.588
so my glorious erection shall represent...

02:05.589 --> 02:09.024
...our culture in perpetuity.

02:09.025 --> 02:14.836
Behold, rising before you the greatest
erection on the continent.

02:15.755 --> 02:18.304
The greatest erection of the age!

02:19.976 --> 02:22.527
The greatest erection on the planet!

02:29.799 --> 02:32.099
- Hold this.
- Of course.

02:39.998 --> 02:44.053
For the Herald, Your Grace.
I understand you'll be making
an important announcement tonight.

02:50.866 --> 02:53.918
Good afternoon, ladies.
Please, excuse me, please.

03:14.358 --> 03:16.824
- And the Perrier-Jouet should be chilled.
You understand? Chilled.
- Yes, sir.

03:16.908 --> 03:20.251
Leopold! Leopold, where have you been?

03:20.962 --> 03:21.966
Leopold!

03:22.467 --> 03:26.438
Otis, I demand explication!
It's half past 5:00! He's not even dressed!

03:26.522 --> 03:30.911
- He'll be ready, my lord. I assure you.
- I don't want him ready.
I want him resplendent!

03:32.374 --> 03:33.837
Ah, Miss Blaine.

03:34.631 --> 03:37.683
You dance like a... like a herd of cattle.

03:38.853 --> 03:43.743
You are a rare woman
who lights up a room simply by leaving it.

03:44.956 --> 03:47.631
Might you be rich, Miss Blaine?
You see..

03:48.382 --> 03:51.885
...whilst I am the third Duke the little
secret of those of us in the Royal Court...

03:51.886 --> 03:56.157
...apart from our general uselessness
is our massive indebtedness.

03:56.158 --> 03:58.372
It's always been
your misfortune, Leopold...

03:58.457 --> 04:02.385
...that you so thoroughly amuse yourself
with the sound of your own voice.

04:02.930 --> 04:04.351
In a life as stagnant as mine..

04:04.434 --> 04:07.486
...that I can amuse myself at all
is an evolutionary marvel.

04:15.176 --> 04:18.060
- Please don't touch that.
- The device you were jabbering about.

04:18.144 --> 04:20.485
To take priests to the bell tower.

04:20.736 --> 04:23.370
To take anyone, Uncle,
to the floor they so desire.

04:23.495 --> 04:27.340
Buildings continue to climb.
Soon they will outstrip
the stamina of our legs.

04:27.633 --> 04:30.392
You speak of progress and invention.

04:30.475 --> 04:33.610
Yet what I offer you downstairs is reality.

04:33.862 --> 04:36.411
Take a wife. Marry.

04:36.662 --> 04:37.664
Marriage...

04:38.500 --> 04:40.633
...marriage is the promise of eternal love.

04:40.717 --> 04:44.854
As a man of honor, I can not
promise eternally what I
have never felt momentarily.

04:45.649 --> 04:50.038
Born into privilege,
yet perversely ashamed of it.
That is your tragedy.

04:50.331 --> 04:53.382
My God! If my brother could only see you,
he'll be heartbroken.

04:53.675 --> 04:55.932
- You are no duke!
- Of course I'm not.

04:56.224 --> 04:58.941
The monarchy is dead, Uncle.
We are relics. That is reality.

04:59.108 --> 05:02.284
The new Royals are men of accomplishment.
Men like Roebling, with his bridge..

05:02.369 --> 05:06.005
...Edison, with his lamp,
Diesel, Bell, Westinghouse...

05:07.259 --> 05:09.349
Those men made themselves from nothing!

05:09.851 --> 05:15.033
You, on the other hand, were born with
everything and from it, fashioned nothing.

05:16.371 --> 05:20.134
As of tonight, I wash my hands of you.

05:22.600 --> 05:25.066
Take a good look at
your dance card, Leopold.

05:25.232 --> 05:27.699
A wealthy bride is your only surety.

05:48.181 --> 05:53.489
Your Grace, may I present Miss Tree
of the Trees of Schenectady, sir.

05:56.081 --> 05:57.209
Miss Tree?

06:02.435 --> 06:06.740
It's an honor to be making
your royal acquaintance, Your Highness.

06:12.366 --> 06:13.369
Shall we?

06:35.006 --> 06:36.006
I've never been to England... but...

06:37.205 --> 06:39.889
Father's teeth were made there.

06:39.890 --> 06:41.877
He's quite rich, your father?

06:41.878 --> 06:43.438
Oh, yes..

07:33.309 --> 07:35.273
Many dreams, all useless.

07:50.154 --> 07:51.158
Who are you?

07:57.093 --> 07:59.267
No, no, no.

07:59.768 --> 08:03.891
Please, wait, no.
I don't want to harm you. Stop! Please!

08:03.892 --> 08:05.893
Sir, wait!

08:05.894 --> 08:07.294
Please stop! Please!

08:10.488 --> 08:11.488
Stop! Leopold!

08:15.012 --> 08:16.684
Pardon me. Pardon me.

08:19.526 --> 08:20.948
Go! Go!

09:35.937 --> 09:37.526
Stop, sir! Please!

09:53.490 --> 09:54.493
Oh, my God.

10:08.871 --> 10:09.875
No!

10:12.758 --> 10:13.761
Let go!

10:14.645 --> 10:16.359
Just let go. It's okay!

10:18.154 --> 10:20.453
You don't understand!
Let go!

10:23.922 --> 10:27.631
- Oh!
- I don't want to hurt you! Let go!

10:43.674 --> 10:44.914
What?

10:46.171 --> 10:49.731
- I'm sorry.
- Well, you should be.

10:51.139 --> 10:53.323
It's just that...

10:53.884 --> 10:58.728
if a guy like that can get a girl like you,
what's left for a guy like me?

10:58.729 --> 11:01.129
A guy like that can get a girl like me.

11:01.336 --> 11:04.096
But a girl like me will never love him.

11:04.240 --> 11:05.240
Are you saying you love me?

11:06.328 --> 11:07.608
It's possible.

11:23.416 --> 11:25.376
Turn it up higher.

11:25.628 --> 11:28.108
Some more, turn it up higher.

11:30.954 --> 11:33.554
I've never felt so happy.

11:47.828 --> 11:50.404
That's right, you can
just leave it blank, Ok?

11:50.405 --> 11:53.605
It's really just about
what you're feeling. All right?

11:54.757 --> 11:57.024
Guy in the windbreaker right there.

11:57.025 --> 11:59.357
Two ladies right in front of him.

12:00.702 --> 12:01.903
Hey.

12:01.904 --> 12:03.163
So how did you think it went?

12:03.164 --> 12:06.248
Well, if I had to guess, mid 60's.

12:06.795 --> 12:08.302
Why don't they love it?

12:08.303 --> 12:10.052
- She's not likeable.
- She's right.

12:10.053 --> 12:12.263
Absolutely. I can do some trims
where she sleeps with her boss.

12:12.264 --> 12:14.114
- Cut that whole section.
- Excuse me?

12:14.283 --> 12:17.042
Excuse me.
What are you talking about?

12:17.043 --> 12:19.598
- The movie, Richard, your movie?
- I'm aware of that.

12:19.599 --> 12:20.598
I want to say something.

12:20.599 --> 12:23.153
I think Julie is likeable.
Very likeable in this picture.

12:23.301 --> 12:24.553
And real.

12:24.995 --> 12:27.529
What, excuse me, you've never
made a mistake in your life?

12:27.530 --> 12:30.062
You have no flaws? You never
slept with the wrong guy?

12:30.063 --> 12:33.078
I'm not the protagonist
in a major motion picture.

12:33.079 --> 12:37.035
Let me tell you something, you people,
you are sucking the life
out of American cinema.

12:37.036 --> 12:38.580
Richard, come on.

12:38.581 --> 12:42.521
It's a comedy. But it's also a drama.
It can be about something.

12:45.742 --> 12:49.080
"You are sucking the life
out of American cinema."

12:49.459 --> 12:52.244
"You are sucking the life
out of American cinema"?

12:52.245 --> 12:55.250
- Maybe he's got a point, though?
- What?

12:55.342 --> 12:56.342
Well...

12:56.594 --> 12:59.610
Don't you ever think that
what we do is a bit... crass?

13:00.708 --> 13:04.774
We find out what regular people think
and we pass on their wisdom.

13:04.775 --> 13:08.281
That's what we do.
Is that crass? Is that cold?
I don't think so.

13:08.282 --> 13:11.852
We make peanut butter creamier.
We make cereal crunchier.

13:11.853 --> 13:13.996
Sit-coms funnier.
Boring movies shorter.

13:13.997 --> 13:16.356
We made Smuckers get
the seeds out of their jam.

13:16.357 --> 13:19.457
We did that.
If you ask me, we're heroes.

13:19.849 --> 13:23.029
It goes with the territory every
once in a while some pompous jerk...

13:23.030 --> 13:24.594
sticks his head out
of his cave and says...

13:24.595 --> 13:27.466
"Hey, I like seeds in my jam.
Without seeds it's just jelly."

13:27.467 --> 13:30.730
"You people are sucking
the life out of my condiments."

13:30.731 --> 13:32.879
I say to him... this is
what I say to him, Darcy...

13:32.880 --> 13:36.216
You, baby, are one percent
of one percent.

13:36.217 --> 13:37.669
Your opinion is irrelevant.

13:37.670 --> 13:40.715
I went out with a visionary
like you for four years.

13:40.716 --> 13:42.746
And I had to pay his rent?!

13:42.747 --> 13:46.721
Because he couldn't stoop down
and get a job, like the rest of us?

13:46.722 --> 13:48.717
- This is not about Stuart.
- Yes it is!

13:48.718 --> 13:52.693
It is about Stuart. It's about
anybody who can't face up to reality.

13:52.694 --> 13:55.732
I don't care if it's crass.
Give me the number.
Give me the bottom line.

13:55.733 --> 13:58.581
Give me the truth
straight up, no chaser.

14:54.423 --> 14:55.591
<i>Bart!</i>

15:02.551 --> 15:03.719
<i>Quiet!</i>

15:26.001 --> 15:28.177
Oh my God!

15:40.618 --> 15:42.462
We must remember, Bart...

15:42.463 --> 15:47.075
...that sometimes, it is okay
to color outside the lines.

15:54.914 --> 15:57.630
- Hello?
- My Palm Pilot. You still have it.

15:58.007 --> 16:00.222
Kate, it's 1:00 in the morning.

16:00.306 --> 16:02.437
And clearly you're awake,
so what is the infraction?

16:02.520 --> 16:04.316
Look, Kate, I don't know
where your Palm Pilot is.

16:04.317 --> 16:07.997
And I can't do this right now.
Not now.
I'm expecting a call.

16:25.929 --> 16:29.314
Oh, Bart.
Oh, I'm sorry, baby.

16:30.150 --> 16:32.616
She is not a happy person.

16:38.093 --> 16:40.016
Goddamn it!

16:44.736 --> 16:47.571
- You know what, Stuart?
You know what? I'm...
- Kate...

16:47.825 --> 16:50.590
Please. I've got somebody here, okay?

16:50.591 --> 16:52.262
I know. I saw her.

16:52.346 --> 16:54.144
- No, you didn't.
- Yes, I did!

16:54.227 --> 16:56.877
It's a him, if that's any
kind of consolation to you.

16:56.878 --> 17:00.747
So, look, now that you know
I'm not getting laid, just go to bed, okay?

17:00.748 --> 17:03.758
Nuh-uh, don't.
Do not hang up on me, Stuart.
Don't do that.

17:03.967 --> 17:06.635
Kate, please.

17:06.636 --> 17:09.771
I beg of you.
Something big is happening.

17:10.362 --> 17:11.365
Something...

17:11.992 --> 17:13.585
...that validates my entire life.

17:13.627 --> 17:17.175
"Something that validates
your entire life."
What could that possibly be?

17:18.137 --> 17:19.851
- Are you sitting down?
- Yes.

17:20.269 --> 17:21.732
- No, you're not.
- Yes, I am.

17:21.815 --> 17:23.194
- No, you're not.
- Ye...

17:25.867 --> 17:26.869
Okay.

17:30.039 --> 17:31.251
I found it.

17:31.865 --> 17:34.438
- What did you find?
- A portal.

17:35.818 --> 17:38.695
A crack in the fabric of time.

17:38.696 --> 17:40.833
It was over the East River, Kate,
just where I said it would be.

17:40.834 --> 17:45.348
- You found the portal?
- A portal into April 28th, 1876.

17:45.410 --> 17:48.002
I jumped off the Brooklyn Bridge...

17:48.471 --> 17:51.774
...and took a walk in 1876 today.

17:52.030 --> 17:57.500
I followed my great, great grandpa,
around old New York.

17:57.501 --> 17:59.558
- Are you listening?
- Avidly.

17:59.559 --> 18:02.423
This here's the twist, Kate.
Here's the kicker.

18:02.424 --> 18:03.904
<i>What's the kicker?</i>

18:05.273 --> 18:07.500
He followed me home.

18:07.692 --> 18:09.530
- Your great-great grandfather...
- Yes.

18:09.531 --> 18:12.255
- Viscount of Buffalo.
- No, he's not a viscount...

18:12.256 --> 18:14.387
- The Duke of Buffalo...
- No, the Duke of Albany.

18:14.388 --> 18:17.803
- Albany followed you home
through a crack in time.
- He's a brilliant engineer.

18:17.804 --> 18:21.152
He patented the counterweight pulley.
He invented the elevator,
for Christ's sake.

18:21.153 --> 18:24.108
You know what, Stuart? You know what?
I'm not your girlfriend anymore.

18:24.109 --> 18:26.237
I haven't been for a whole month now.

18:26.238 --> 18:29.269
- You can tell me the truth.
- I am telling you the truth, Kate.

18:29.270 --> 18:34.456
You can tell me you went and
picked up a transvestite
in Times Square. I don't care.

18:34.457 --> 18:39.604
You know what, Kate?
This is it, right here.
This is it, in a nutshell. Our downfall.

18:39.605 --> 18:41.917
You never... not once... believed in me.

18:41.918 --> 18:46.950
Oh, I did, Stuart. I did, for four years.
And I got burnt.

18:46.951 --> 18:50.408
Okay, you want to know who he is?
I'll tell you who he is.

18:50.409 --> 18:55.555
He is a hacker. High end. English.
I know him from Columbia.

18:55.556 --> 18:58.594
He's in town for the
Mac Expo at the Javits.

18:58.595 --> 19:02.668
We went out, got a little sloppy
on Guinness and he passed out on my couch.

19:02.669 --> 19:06.470
- And that's the truth?
- Mm-hmm. That's the truth. Okay?
Are you happy now?

19:06.471 --> 19:11.047
Is that plausible enough for you
and your little focus group?

19:11.248 --> 19:13.785
You know what, Stuart?

19:14.186 --> 19:17.299
I blew my best years on you.

19:17.300 --> 19:19.241
Those were your best?

19:25.611 --> 19:26.614
Look...

19:27.869 --> 19:29.406
I'm sorry.

19:29.791 --> 19:33.501
I have to go.
You'll get your Pilot in the morning.

20:45.448 --> 20:47.205
Orange alert.

20:57.236 --> 20:59.703
What is it?

21:03.381 --> 21:06.182
Bart! No!

21:10.947 --> 21:12.326
Bart, stop!

21:15.586 --> 21:16.590
It's okay.

21:19.181 --> 21:21.229
- You?
- It's okay.

21:21.438 --> 21:25.451
- Where am I?
- Well, um, there's not
an easy explanation for that.

21:25.535 --> 21:29.756
If it's a ransom you seek,
my uncle won't pay a cent.
Except, perhaps, for my demise.

21:29.966 --> 21:32.180
No. no. You're not being kidnapped.
Bart, quiet!

21:32.265 --> 21:34.521
I can scarcely see, thanks to your spray.

21:34.604 --> 21:39.120
My eyes feel like Steak au Poivre.
So I ask you again, where the hell am I?

21:43.676 --> 21:45.926
<i>As far as I'm concerned...</i>

21:47.771 --> 21:51.200
<i>you might be Jack the Ripper!</i>

21:52.420 --> 21:57.176
And you would have me believe that I'm
being detained at present in the hereafter?
The time to come?

21:57.177 --> 22:00.095
Yes. Bart, quiet!
He needs a walk.

22:00.096 --> 22:03.439
And you would have me believe
that you you are my progeny.

22:03.440 --> 22:04.440
A product of a marriage unmade.

22:04.441 --> 22:05.441
Yes.

22:05.742 --> 22:09.492
Oh! And you would have me believe
that you have found a crack in time.

22:09.493 --> 22:13.464
You, of all people, should understand.
I mean, you're a scientist.
You invented the elevator.

22:13.547 --> 22:16.849
What is an elevator?
What the hell are you talk...
Where the hell am I?!

22:17.017 --> 22:20.319
I told you... you haven't
actually gone anywhere.
You're still in New York.

22:20.402 --> 22:22.868
That, sir, is not New York!

22:22.952 --> 22:24.414
I'm afraid it is.

22:25.752 --> 22:28.887
- No, Kate.
- Hello. Hello there. What's your name?

22:29.515 --> 22:30.351
Leopold.

22:30.434 --> 22:33.110
Tell me something.
I'm having trouble with my G-5.

22:33.193 --> 22:36.997
How much RAM do I need
to properly run OS 9.6?

22:38.125 --> 22:40.842
Clearly, the Mac Expo is out.

22:40.967 --> 22:45.398
So you must be a man out of time?
Or Sergeant Pepper?

22:46.192 --> 22:49.076
- You know what? Actually,
we could use a little privacy.
- Stuart, I want my Palm Pilot.

22:49.161 --> 22:52.463
- I'm not... I'm serious.
Maybe later on, Kate.
- I just want my Palm Pilot, Stuart!

22:52.546 --> 22:56.224
- No. No.
- Hey, give me my Palm Pilot!
Give it to me.

22:57.562 --> 22:58.732
This is madness.

22:59.151 --> 23:01.951
This is madness. Who was that?
I feel as if I've seen her...

23:02.035 --> 23:05.922
Women have changed since your time, Leo.
They've become dangerous.

23:07.133 --> 23:08.346
It's on the landing!

23:11.146 --> 23:14.323
You say this is no kidnapping.
You say you mean no harm.

23:14.407 --> 23:17.879
Then why is it, sir,
you will not unlock the door?

23:19.131 --> 23:21.848
I'm sorry, okay?
I'm sorry about her. I'm...

23:23.019 --> 23:27.573
Look, with all due respect I can't
let you just go running
around free out there, okay?

23:27.574 --> 23:30.166
This is New York City.
It's not such a safe place anymore.

23:30.249 --> 23:34.764
Look at you. You look like some
sort of psychotic escapee
from a Renaissance faire.

23:34.931 --> 23:38.442
I understand you have some anxiety
but you have to trust me.

23:39.028 --> 23:40.908
I'm going to get you home, okay?

23:42.956 --> 23:44.085
I promise.

23:44.879 --> 23:45.883
Bart!

23:50.188 --> 23:52.027
The portal opens up again next week.
Monday.

23:52.111 --> 23:54.953
I know that, because it was my
back-up in case I didn't
make it last night.

23:55.037 --> 23:58.757
It's on a cycle, you know?
Kind of like, uh... total eclipse.

23:58.841 --> 24:00.972
Once every 20 years.
You understand?

24:01.056 --> 24:04.442
Generally, I understand everything.
Since I've met you, nothing.

24:04.651 --> 24:09.124
I can only assume I'm in a nightmare
brought on by agita, or else I am dead.

24:09.541 --> 24:12.718
You're not dead.
Come here. Sit down. Here.

24:16.605 --> 24:18.027
Want some milk in yours?

24:19.949 --> 24:22.040
Bart, can I just have...

24:24.004 --> 24:26.720
Sorry. He's really got to go out.

24:34.161 --> 24:36.544
I'll be honored if you
took a look at those.

24:36.598 --> 24:41.433
Um, I'll explain everything when I get
back. He's got to go out or he's
going to drop a bomb in there.

24:41.476 --> 24:42.939
Come on. Let's go.

24:46.478 --> 24:47.647
Back in five.

24:55.740 --> 24:58.164
One quick trip to Spectra, Bart...

24:58.165 --> 25:03.557
...and you and I will be Nobel Laureates.

25:10.393 --> 25:11.604
Come on, Bart.

25:12.046 --> 25:13.805
Hey, let's go.

25:14.409 --> 25:16.163
Come on.
Let's go.

25:23.837 --> 25:24.841
Oh, Jesus!

25:28.038 --> 25:29.378
Oh, God.

25:29.562 --> 25:30.899
Good boy, Bart!

25:31.712 --> 25:32.841
Stay!

25:33.177 --> 25:35.769
Stay, Bart! Stay!

25:37.459 --> 25:39.591
Oh, Bart, please stay!

26:17.615 --> 26:21.294
Stuart you forgot the pointy thing!

26:23.410 --> 26:24.537
Stuart...

26:36.755 --> 26:40.770
Look, this is not complex.
He gave me the Palm Pilot
but he forgot the pointy thing.

26:40.771 --> 26:42.945
- I've been warned about you.
- Oh. Really?

26:42.973 --> 26:45.594
And what, pray tell, did the great
disappointment say?

26:45.595 --> 26:47.768
- That you were dangerous,
though you hardly look it.
- Oh, really?

26:47.869 --> 26:50.335
A lady in trousers isn't dangerous,
merely plain.

26:50.373 --> 26:52.964
- I take it you're a career woman.
- Yeah, market research.

26:52.981 --> 26:55.281
Mm. Fine avocation for women, research.

26:55.612 --> 26:57.409
Perfect for the feminine mind.

27:00.126 --> 27:01.464
You're a trip, Lionel.

27:07.046 --> 27:10.725
I myself once courted
a librarian in Sussex.

27:13.486 --> 27:15.327
Good for you.

27:17.705 --> 27:21.090
I must confess I feel as though
we've met on a previous occasion.

27:21.426 --> 27:25.072
Well, Lionel, seeing as
I've never met a single friend of Stuart's.

27:25.073 --> 27:29.967
I'm not even sure he's ever had any.
I really don't see how that's possible.

27:31.839 --> 27:34.389
Oh, man! Bart!

27:34.947 --> 27:38.959
He just made Lake Erie out there.
You just can't toss a dog
out into the hall like that.

27:39.043 --> 27:42.600
- You can't do that.
- I assure you, I did not.

27:44.101 --> 27:46.107
- Let's go.
- I beg your pardon?

27:46.191 --> 27:47.988
Come on. Let's go!

27:49.576 --> 27:50.580
Bart...

27:52.669 --> 27:56.181
Look, pal, I don't care
how many elevators you got.
This one's in my building.

27:56.516 --> 27:57.770
Hang-hang on a second.

27:59.023 --> 28:01.448
Sorry about the elevator, Miss Kate.
I've got them on the phone right now.

28:01.532 --> 28:03.956
Hey, Gracy.
This is Lionel, Stuart's friend.

28:04.165 --> 28:05.209
How do you do?

28:06.003 --> 28:08.641
Ten minutes?
I need someone here right now.

28:38.983 --> 28:40.279
- Watch it, man.
- I beg your pardon.

28:40.364 --> 28:41.910
Hey, what are you doing?

28:41.993 --> 28:44.125
You need to be going that way.
There's an electron...

28:44.209 --> 28:46.675
Hello? Hello?
There's an electronics store. Hello?

28:46.759 --> 28:47.762
I'm sorry, miss.

28:47.929 --> 28:51.147
There's a patch of grass across the street.
Take him there. He'll do his business.

28:51.231 --> 28:53.781
Can you give this to Stuart, please?
It's his cable bill.

29:09.079 --> 29:13.469
They haul our furniture and cradle our
children but this morning,
from the Battery to the Bronx...

29:13.552 --> 29:15.516
elevators have mysteriously...

29:27.596 --> 29:30.273
So sorry.

29:30.398 --> 29:32.822
- I do beg your pardon.
- Stupid!

29:38.130 --> 29:39.719
I beg your pardon.

29:48.246 --> 29:49.960
Are you going to remove that?

29:52.468 --> 29:53.721
I beg your pardon?

29:54.181 --> 29:56.356
Pick it up and put it in the trash.

29:59.198 --> 30:00.827
Absolutely not.

30:02.304 --> 30:06.567
Maybe you don't understand.
It's against the law to leave it there.

30:07.474 --> 30:09.523
Are you suggesting, madam,
there exists a law..

30:09.561 --> 30:12.065
...compelling gentlemen to lay hold
of canine bowel movements?

30:12.159 --> 30:15.792
I'm suggesting you pick
the poop up and throw it away now.

30:17.558 --> 30:19.899
I refuse. Respectfully.

30:22.450 --> 30:25.376
All right.
What's your name, fancy pants?

30:25.380 --> 30:26.856
Leopold...

30:26.857 --> 30:28.863
Alexis Elija Walker...

30:30.684 --> 30:32.858
...Thomas Garrett Mountbatten.

30:37.159 --> 30:39.542
All right, Stuart.

30:40.522 --> 30:41.693
Have a nice day.

30:47.102 --> 30:50.237
I appreciate you putting in a good
word for me but J.J.'s
not back from London.

30:51.342 --> 30:55.272
- Right. Bye. What's with the elevators?
- It's happening everywhere.

30:56.100 --> 30:57.202
Darci.

30:57.523 --> 30:58.902
Last page.

31:10.349 --> 31:11.353
Sorry.

31:11.676 --> 31:13.934
Did everyone live happily ever after?

31:14.472 --> 31:17.398
He lost his leg to gangrene
waiting for her on the island.

31:17.679 --> 31:20.228
- But they're together now.
- Wonderful.

31:20.407 --> 31:22.956
- Oh, look, you got your Palm Pilot back.
- A nightmare.

31:23.180 --> 31:25.814
Okay, so who do I owe?

31:25.986 --> 31:29.312
Okay, Bobby at Hasbro.
Reeves at Crunch.

31:29.313 --> 31:32.573
And the finals came in for "Love for Sale."
The call with the studio's at 4:00.

31:32.707 --> 31:34.506
The margarine thing's in 15
in the conference room.

31:34.507 --> 31:36.806
J.J. wants to talk to you before that.
Oh, and one more thing.

31:36.936 --> 31:39.377
I remember that you told me
to start thinking ahead...

31:39.378 --> 31:40.573
...so I know your brother's getting back..

31:40.574 --> 31:44.626
- ...from his retreat tomorrow and
if you want something in the fridge...
- Darci...

31:45.275 --> 31:47.659
Can you tell me why I'm upset right now?

31:48.547 --> 31:49.843
Because, uh...

31:50.996 --> 31:55.008
J.J. called this morning.
That is why I have a cell phone.
So you can call me...

31:55.204 --> 31:58.674
Kate, Kate, he didn't call.
He just popped his head in here
and spoke two sentences.

31:58.745 --> 31:59.841
So he's back?

31:59.842 --> 32:02.476
Margo says he's going to make
a big announcement about
the merger next week.

32:02.543 --> 32:05.636
Margo? What does she know?
How does she know anything about anything?

32:06.830 --> 32:07.832
Oh. All right.

32:09.085 --> 32:13.601
So he popped his head in here.
All right, so you have to tell me
exactly what he said, Darci.

32:13.857 --> 32:15.885
You have to start
at the beginning and tell me...

32:15.886 --> 32:19.356
He said,
"Tell Kate I'm going to
sit in on Farmer's Bounty."

32:20.940 --> 32:21.942
J.J.

32:22.823 --> 32:25.205
- Good morning, Kate.
- Good morning.

32:25.455 --> 32:26.835
I'll see you in there.

32:46.690 --> 32:48.821
Good Lord, it still stands.

32:50.952 --> 32:55.778
The world has changed all around it
but Roebling's erection still stands!

32:56.889 --> 32:58.812
That, my friend, is a miracle.

32:59.564 --> 33:01.821
- What?
- It's a miracle, man!

33:02.323 --> 33:03.494
It's a bridge.

33:03.828 --> 33:06.670
Tell me when did they
adapt it for steam engines?

33:08.885 --> 33:10.140
The fire brigade.

33:25.559 --> 33:28.233
I don't know how it happened.
I found him in a shaft.

33:28.359 --> 33:29.361
Stuart!

33:30.574 --> 33:33.166
Leopold, what are you doing out here?

33:33.249 --> 33:35.131
Get back inside!

33:40.021 --> 33:42.320
They're taking him to Goodman Memorial.

33:46.416 --> 33:49.175
Fresh creamery butter.

33:49.551 --> 33:52.560
Is there anything more comforting?

33:52.770 --> 33:56.950
There is and I know you will agree
when you try Farmer's Bounty...

33:57.033 --> 34:01.175
...with the essence
of real butter in every bite.

34:01.256 --> 34:05.184
Your first choice.
However, 45% of our
demo circled "shifty"...

34:05.269 --> 34:07.651
...as his key descriptor. Not good.

34:07.985 --> 34:11.161
This is what I say.
Everybody should be
trying Farmer's Bounty..

34:11.246 --> 34:14.715
...with the real, rich,
creamy taste of real butter.

34:14.797 --> 34:18.016
Try it, and you will be losing pounds.
Poof! Boom! Voila!

34:18.101 --> 34:21.945
Your second choice. Unfortunately,
the group found him obnoxious, abrasive..

34:22.029 --> 34:26.418
...and a whopping 72%
found him just plain creepy.

34:26.668 --> 34:29.846
The spot rolls out in four days.
We have to...

34:30.139 --> 34:32.312
The product is shipping.
What the hell am I supposed to do?

34:32.395 --> 34:34.068
We have to do another session. Tomorrow.

34:34.152 --> 34:38.165
I had my assistant book the response
room at National so we
can decide then and there.

34:42.344 --> 34:44.016
- Kate, are you all right?
- You okay?

34:44.100 --> 34:47.444
- I'm fine.
- Geez, Kate, I'll ask for a decaf.

34:47.652 --> 34:50.536
Monica, I need you to call Barney's.
I need a white blouse, size small...

34:50.621 --> 34:53.777
...in Kate's office by lunch.

35:05.250 --> 35:06.253
Oh, dear.

35:09.933 --> 35:13.067
Hi, you've reached Stuart.
Please leave a message.

35:13.235 --> 35:17.999
Leopold? Leopold, look,
don't be frightened.
This is Stuart, okay?

35:18.083 --> 35:20.842
Is it Bell's talking telegraph?

35:20.926 --> 35:24.645
- I saw a prototype at last year's faire.
- I need you to pick up the handset, Leo.

35:24.728 --> 35:28.826
You pick up the green handset,
because I need to talk to you...

35:28.909 --> 35:31.165
Are-are you there?
Hello?

35:31.292 --> 35:33.967
Leopold, thank God.
Listen, they're taking me to X Rays.

35:34.051 --> 35:36.935
Everything's going to be fine but you
have to stay in the apartment,
do you understand me?

35:37.019 --> 35:39.944
Oh, Stuart, I saw Roebling's bridge today.

35:40.154 --> 35:43.456
- I saw it... complete.
- Yes, yes, but listen to me.

35:43.539 --> 35:46.633
You can't go out again.
You have to stay in the apartment.

35:46.716 --> 35:49.818
- Stay in the apartment? For how long?
- Leo, I'll be back tonight. I promise.

35:49.819 --> 35:51.518
No more field trips.

35:51.519 --> 35:53.036
Would you...

35:53.037 --> 35:56.402
Hel... hello?
Stuart?

35:56.403 --> 35:57.406
Hello?

35:58.410 --> 35:59.413
Blast!

36:03.414 --> 36:04.417
Hello.

36:05.439 --> 36:06.443
Hello.

36:07.137 --> 36:08.141
Who are you?

36:08.435 --> 36:11.152
Hector.
My mom works late on Wednesdays...

36:11.252 --> 36:13.634
...so I watch TV with Stuart.

36:15.401 --> 36:17.274
Want some Pirate's Booty?

36:20.448 --> 36:24.000
Excuse me, J.J., I wanted
to thank you for the shirt.
That was very nice.

36:24.085 --> 36:25.757
Come in, come in.

36:26.259 --> 36:27.262
Yeah. Uh-huh.

36:28.641 --> 36:29.728
Absolutely.

36:30.146 --> 36:33.155
Oh, good, good.
Yeah, she's here right now. I'll tell her.

36:33.656 --> 36:35.789
Okay... okay. Bye.

36:37.126 --> 36:38.130
Sit down.

36:38.924 --> 36:42.268
That was Barry. He was thrilled
with your work at the screening last night.

36:42.476 --> 36:44.149
Oh, good. Good.

36:51.296 --> 36:53.637
You're a rarity among women, Kate.

36:55.059 --> 36:56.062
I'm sorry?

36:56.312 --> 36:58.569
You don't cling to illusion.
You don't get...

36:58.812 --> 37:00.692
...caught up in emotion.

37:02.039 --> 37:03.543
You don't do pretty.

37:04.839 --> 37:05.843
I don't?

37:06.261 --> 37:08.936
You skew male. You're like a man.

37:09.771 --> 37:15.081
A man who understands women
their desires, their needs.

37:16.418 --> 37:20.514
You understand them but
you're not really one of them.

37:22.687 --> 37:26.700
- You don't mind my being frank, do you?
- No. I don't. No.

37:29.292 --> 37:30.379
Edamame?

37:40.871 --> 37:41.874
Kate?

37:56.671 --> 37:59.012
- But one day,
he lowered the Jolly Roger...
- Stu?

37:59.095 --> 38:02.147
...and set sail in search
another kind of treasure.

38:02.648 --> 38:06.912
Not money, not jewels, not gold...
but a bride.

38:07.121 --> 38:10.967
Despite his being a ruffian of the brine
fearless in his plunder...

38:11.051 --> 38:15.355
...and merciless with the sword
the Pirate King was also lonely.

38:17.320 --> 38:19.619
You see, he had never met a lady.

38:19.828 --> 38:21.584
He never met a girl?

38:21.876 --> 38:26.014
No. Not a girl, not a lady,
not even his own mother.

38:26.265 --> 38:27.561
So what happened?

38:27.770 --> 38:30.362
As with all comedies
the most ridiculous thing imaginable...

38:30.445 --> 38:33.747
the Pirate King fell in love with
the major general's daughter.

38:34.257 --> 38:37.113
I had the good fortune to see the premiere
last month at the Fifth Avenue Theatre.

38:37.114 --> 38:39.328
Since when is Penzance at the Fifth?

38:43.615 --> 38:47.335
Is it your habit, sir to simply enter
a conversation without introduction?

38:47.767 --> 38:49.941
Whoa, you are deep in it.

38:50.317 --> 38:53.703
It's cool. I'm an actor, too.
I'm Charlie. I live downstairs.

38:54.480 --> 38:57.113
Kate McKay, senior vice president.

38:57.198 --> 38:59.204
Darci, it hasn't happened.

38:59.287 --> 39:02.631
All he did was dangle a carrot.
Until he makes a decision..

39:02.788 --> 39:05.882
- ...the pressure's doubled.
- When's he going to make a decision?

39:06.143 --> 39:09.194
We're having dinner tomorrow
to discuss it further at Commune.

39:09.361 --> 39:10.156
- Kate?
- Yeah.

39:10.240 --> 39:11.577
- I have Stuart on the line.
- No!

39:11.702 --> 39:12.664
- He says he's...
- No!

39:12.748 --> 39:13.918
...in the hospital.

39:25.431 --> 39:29.193
Leopold is just sitting alone
in my apartment right now.
God knows what could happen to him.

39:29.276 --> 39:30.280
Do you know he got outside today?

39:30.364 --> 39:31.952
Of course he did...
I made him walk your dog.

39:32.035 --> 39:32.871
What?

39:32.956 --> 39:36.090
No, Kate, you can't do that!
He can't go outside!

39:36.341 --> 39:39.643
Jesus Christ, Kate.
He's from 1876, Kate.

39:39.726 --> 39:44.366
He doesn't know our customs.
If something were to happen
to him it could be catastrophic.

39:44.669 --> 39:46.574
His mere presents
has already caused an occlusion.

39:46.575 --> 39:47.617
Occlusion!

39:47.618 --> 39:51.385
If he doesn't go back on Monday,
I may cease to exist!

39:52.730 --> 39:56.628
I'm his decedent, Kate, along with
God knows how many other people.

39:56.629 --> 39:59.430
If he doesn't go back to April 28, 1876,

39:59.431 --> 40:01.950
he doesn't get married, he doesn't have
children, and you want to know what?

40:01.951 --> 40:05.001
What happened with the elevators today,
well that's going to seem
like a walk in the park. - Stuart!

40:05.002 --> 40:07.204
This is embarrassing.
It's embarrassing now, all right?

40:07.205 --> 40:09.041
I'm sorry that you got hurt.

40:09.042 --> 40:12.333
But there happens to be a lot
going on with me right now.

40:12.334 --> 40:14.299
Someone has to keep an eye on him.

40:14.508 --> 40:16.890
Stuart, he's a grown man.

40:16.974 --> 40:18.625
He's a grown man. He's fine.

40:18.626 --> 40:22.155
- He can take care of himself.
- No. Wait. Aah!
- I'm going.

40:22.156 --> 40:23.620
Kate, please.

40:24.790 --> 40:27.592
Just take this to Spectra, okay?
Get it developed.

40:27.675 --> 40:30.642
You'll see... I'm telling the truth.
Tell Manny it's important.

40:30.894 --> 40:32.273
You want double prints?

40:33.109 --> 40:36.369
That's not funny, Kate.
This is not a joke.

40:37.498 --> 40:40.424
You need help, Stuart.
You need help.

41:08.885 --> 41:09.888
Charlie?

41:11.439 --> 41:12.651
Hey, Kate!

41:14.197 --> 41:16.288
Can I see you downstairs for a minute?

41:16.581 --> 41:19.047
I invited someone to dinner.
He's up there all alone.

41:19.130 --> 41:21.261
Stuart's in the hospital.
I didn't think you'll
have such a problem...

41:21.346 --> 41:24.062
No, you didn't think, Charlie.
You didn't think.

41:24.188 --> 41:26.654
You came home early,
one day early from actor camp.

41:26.738 --> 41:29.497
Okay, it's not actor camp and yeah,
I came home a day early, all right?

41:29.580 --> 41:31.461
There was this tai chi broad
who kept trying stick her fingers...

41:31.544 --> 41:36.268
No, this is the point. You immediately
march upstairs to my
ex-boyfriend's apartment...

41:36.352 --> 41:39.570
- ...and you invite his freakish friend...
- See, that's what it's about.
It's not that I went up there.

41:39.654 --> 41:42.246
- It's that it was your ex-boyfriend...
- No, it's not about Stuart.

41:42.998 --> 41:45.296
Greetings, Kate. Charles.

41:45.423 --> 41:46.426
Hey, Leo.

41:47.386 --> 41:48.641
Be nice.

42:11.379 --> 42:15.058
- So, when's Stuart getting back?
- Couple days, maybe a week.

42:15.142 --> 42:17.232
He promised me that he would
return late this evening.

42:17.315 --> 42:20.993
Well, maybe he will, Leopold.
He's so big on keeping his promises...

42:31.333 --> 42:33.044
May I have the next course?

42:34.586 --> 42:36.132
There is no next course.

42:38.131 --> 42:42.770
Where I come from the meal is
the result of reflection and study.

42:43.075 --> 42:46.795
Menus are prepared
in advance timed to perfection.

42:46.952 --> 42:51.927
It is said, without the culinary arts
the crudeness of reality
would be unbearable.

42:52.887 --> 42:54.602
We had a saying in the McKay house:

42:54.685 --> 42:58.573
"You shake and shake the ketchup bottle.
None will come, and then a lot'll."

43:03.003 --> 43:04.969
- What is that?
- I beg your pardon?

43:05.094 --> 43:06.264
Why are you standing?

43:06.347 --> 43:08.813
I'm accustomed to stand
when a lady leaves the table.

43:18.135 --> 43:21.438
Tell me, Charles when Stuart and your
sister were engaged...

43:21.521 --> 43:24.488
...did you happen to read his papers on
the temporal universe?

43:24.572 --> 43:26.494
I spent the morning perusing them,
and must confess...

43:26.578 --> 43:29.713
Stuart and I were never engaged.
Not even close.

43:30.006 --> 43:31.219
But I did read...

43:31.636 --> 43:32.681
Thank you.

43:32.765 --> 43:35.690
But I did read his papers however,
to show support.

43:35.774 --> 43:37.739
Is Stuart still trying
to make a time machine?

43:37.822 --> 43:40.749
That's the beauty of it,
he discovered no machine was necessary.

43:40.832 --> 43:44.002
All one had to do was to develop
formula to forecast portals...

43:44.003 --> 43:46.516
...natural windows in the fabric of time.

43:46.517 --> 43:49.944
Apparently, Stuart located
one utilizing modern...

43:54.793 --> 43:57.260
Utilizing modern theories
of weather prediction.

43:57.343 --> 43:58.345
What's a portal?

43:58.430 --> 44:00.604
An opening which exists for but a moment.

44:00.687 --> 44:02.902
This explains why one must jump
through it from a height...

44:02.986 --> 44:07.584
in order to achieve the required velocity.
The speed of gravity, to be exact.
It's quite brilliant.

44:08.210 --> 44:12.349
You are so method. You don't even break
for a second, do you? It's unbelievable!

44:12.432 --> 44:16.989
Oh, stop it, please! No more! Stop, please?
I beg you. I'm tired. Can you go away?

44:17.073 --> 44:19.079
Can you just go away?
Can you go away?

44:19.538 --> 44:22.381
- She's drunk, Leo.
- Oh, shut up, Charlie!

44:22.464 --> 44:24.721
And you, can you go upstairs?
Can you go away?

44:24.805 --> 44:27.730
I am truly sorry if I have
offended you in any way.

44:28.859 --> 44:30.072
Goodnight, Charles.

44:32.999 --> 44:34.126
Goodnight, Leo.

44:39.394 --> 44:40.522
What the hell was that?

44:40.647 --> 44:44.158
He thinks he's from
the 19th century, Charlie.
He thinks he's a duke.

44:44.242 --> 44:45.203
I know.

44:45.287 --> 44:46.709
- Isn't that cool?
- No.

44:46.792 --> 44:49.216
Kate, he's in character.
He is an actor.

44:49.300 --> 44:51.056
Oh, really? For what show?

44:52.225 --> 44:55.069
You know that just because someone
doesn't have a paying gig...

44:55.152 --> 44:58.161
...it doesn't mean they're not
working on their craft.

45:42.342 --> 45:44.098
What's going on here?

45:44.891 --> 45:47.858
I think there's something
wrong with his, uh...

45:48.570 --> 45:49.574
...thing.

45:53.001 --> 45:55.007
- Give me that telephone.
- No.

45:55.550 --> 45:57.599
- Give it to me.
- No, I need to...

45:58.978 --> 46:01.319
What do you expect me to do?
You took away my cell phone.

46:01.402 --> 46:04.704
- They're not allowed on hospital property.
- I have to make a phone call!

46:04.787 --> 46:06.962
You're not going to make one now.

46:08.049 --> 46:10.681
No, no, you don't understand.
This is a very important phone call.

46:10.765 --> 46:13.316
I have to leave this hospital now.
I can't be here anymore.

46:13.399 --> 46:16.158
Mr. Besser, I am tired of telling you this.

46:16.241 --> 46:20.797
You are not going nowhere
until Dr. Feinstein signs your release!

46:20.880 --> 46:23.390
Did you ever take any
earth science, Esther, hmm?

46:23.807 --> 46:25.228
You look like a smart woman.

46:25.354 --> 46:29.612
Ever hear of the time-space continuum?
Sounds important, doesn't it? Well, it is.

46:29.613 --> 46:32.375
You want to know something, Esther?
It's broken! Okay?

46:32.376 --> 46:34.131
And I'm the only guy who can fix it.

46:34.215 --> 46:37.349
So why don't you go down the hall there
and get on your little telephone...

46:37.434 --> 46:39.356
...and call Dr. Feinstein...

46:39.566 --> 46:41.780
- Goodnight, Mr. Besser.
- You tell him that...

46:44.079 --> 46:45.292
You tell him that I...

46:50.684 --> 46:54.697
<i>Point the toes, pull your shoulders back.</i>

46:54.781 --> 46:58.249
<i>Take a deep breath in and then exhale
into downward-facing dog.</i>

47:04.603 --> 47:07.404
Oh, be quiet!
Be quiet... oh!

47:22.285 --> 47:23.999
Bart, shut up!

47:24.918 --> 47:29.140
- That thing is a damned hazard!
- It's just a toaster!

47:29.725 --> 47:33.570
Well, insertion of bread into that
so-called toaster produces
no toast at all...

47:33.654 --> 47:36.663
...merely warm bread!
Inserting the bread
twice produces charcoal.

47:36.747 --> 47:40.217
So, clearly, to make proper toast
it requires one and a half insertions...

47:40.300 --> 47:43.142
...which is something for which
the apparatus doesn't begin to allow!

47:43.352 --> 47:48.577
One assumes that when the
General of Electric built it
he might have tried using it.

47:48.786 --> 47:52.004
One assumes the General might
take pride in his creations...

47:52.088 --> 47:54.596
...instead of just foisting them
on an unsuspecting public.

47:54.680 --> 47:55.933
You know something?

47:56.268 --> 47:59.110
Nobody gives a rat's ass...

47:59.193 --> 48:02.580
...that you have to push
the toast down twice.
You know why?

48:02.663 --> 48:06.132
Because everybody pushes
their toast down twice!

48:06.216 --> 48:07.679
Not where I come from.

48:07.762 --> 48:10.145
Oh, because where you come from...

48:10.229 --> 48:13.656
...toast is the result
of reflection and study.

48:13.740 --> 48:15.037
Yes, you mock me.

48:15.120 --> 48:18.059
But perhaps one day,
when you've awoken
from a pleasant slumber...

48:18.060 --> 48:22.224
...to the scent of a warm brioche smothered
in marmalade and fresh creamery butter...

48:22.225 --> 48:26.238
...you'll understand that life
is not solely comprised
of tasks, but tastes.

48:28.371 --> 48:29.373
Say that again.

48:33.093 --> 48:34.097
Pardon me?

48:35.183 --> 48:36.814
- Did they start yet?
- Yes.

48:37.190 --> 48:38.652
Session list.

48:38.861 --> 48:41.621
Leopold, Darci.
Darci, Leopold.

48:41.704 --> 48:44.087
I'll like him to read.
Can you tack him on at the end?

48:44.170 --> 48:47.514
And, Leopold, go with Darci.
She'll take you to the greenroom
and explain everything.

48:48.434 --> 48:50.441
I need to work out.
I need a place I can work out.

48:50.524 --> 48:52.655
If I could get Mr. Duke?
Is he ready? Where is he?

48:52.739 --> 48:55.665
Oh, my God, look at this.
Let's skip this one.

48:55.999 --> 48:58.173
Mr. Duke, right here on the floor.

48:58.507 --> 49:01.726
Excuse me, that's your mark, right there.
Just stand on that tape line.

49:01.809 --> 49:04.694
Look, forget this guy.
I can't waste any more time, J.J.

49:04.777 --> 49:06.784
We need to make a decision now.

49:06.868 --> 49:09.835
All right, we've got
plenty of good choices.
Let's cut it off, Kate.

49:10.295 --> 49:12.093
That would be a mistake, J.J.

49:12.803 --> 49:15.102
Kate, the client wants to move on.

49:15.185 --> 49:18.195
We should see this last guy.
It'll... Two minutes!

49:18.655 --> 49:20.704
I think he looks like the Quaker Oats guy.

49:21.372 --> 49:25.134
Well, Phil, it's really not
about what you think.
It's about what they think.

49:25.217 --> 49:27.851
They've been in a coma
all day and now look at them.

49:27.934 --> 49:31.487
To them, this guy is a dream.

49:31.947 --> 49:35.041
He's handsome, honest, courteous.

49:35.124 --> 49:39.137
Stands when you walk in a room.
Brings you brioche in bed.

49:39.931 --> 49:41.644
If you eat his margarine...

49:41.896 --> 49:45.198
...maybe your hips will shrink
and he'll come to your door.

49:45.532 --> 49:49.573
I take it this is to be delivered
in direct address as on Geronimo.

49:49.574 --> 49:51.998
- Geronimo?
- He means Geraldo.

49:52.596 --> 49:53.600
Exactly.

49:54.477 --> 49:57.947
Okay, everyone... quiet please.
And action.

50:04.342 --> 50:05.763
Start talking, bud.

50:08.229 --> 50:10.695
Fresh creamery butter.

50:11.907 --> 50:14.081
Is there anything more comforting?

50:15.173 --> 50:16.595
I say there is.

50:16.726 --> 50:20.738
And perhaps you'll agree when you sample
fat-free Farmer's Bounty...

50:21.061 --> 50:24.614
...with the genuine essence
of creamery butter in every bite.

50:25.198 --> 50:28.667
With every mouthful of Farmer's Bounty
you shall receive butter's...

50:28.836 --> 50:33.559
...luxurious comfort in your mouth
without adding to the luxury
of your waistline.

50:34.040 --> 50:37.134
Not bad, Kate.
Where'd you find him?

50:38.223 --> 50:39.602
He lives in my building.

50:40.761 --> 50:43.394
Where do I sign?
Right here, and here.

50:46.768 --> 50:49.110
- That was spectacular, Kate.
- Thanks, J.J.

50:49.193 --> 50:51.617
A lot to talk about tonight at dinner.

50:53.582 --> 50:56.174
- Nice work, Mr. Margarine.
- Thank you.

50:58.347 --> 51:00.353
Outfit was a great idea. Nice.

51:04.032 --> 51:05.161
Yes!

51:05.328 --> 51:07.543
Yes! Yes!

51:07.878 --> 51:09.592
Yes!

51:14.471 --> 51:18.400
- You seem pleased.
- Oh, you did so great in there!

51:18.539 --> 51:19.542
Man!

51:20.080 --> 51:25.331
You are going to be on a
national television spot!

51:27.976 --> 51:29.730
I take it you're dining
with that man tonight.

51:29.838 --> 51:33.056
Huh? Oh, yeah, J.J.
He's my boss.

51:34.045 --> 51:36.971
You require a chaperone.
His intentions are obvious.

51:37.222 --> 51:39.353
I'm alone with you.
Do I need a chaperone?

51:39.438 --> 51:42.322
We're not courting, Kate.
If we were, as a man of honor...

51:42.405 --> 51:44.789
...I would have informed you
of my intentions in writing.

52:04.601 --> 52:05.688
Good day.

52:07.903 --> 52:08.823
Hey!

52:08.906 --> 52:12.543
- Kate, why don't we take one of these.
- They're for tourists.

52:13.839 --> 52:17.392
- Sorry, she doesn't seem interested.
- Oh, hey, hello. Hello.

52:18.813 --> 52:20.401
Hey! Hey!

52:21.739 --> 52:24.540
Hey! Hey, you...

52:26.420 --> 52:27.424
Kate!

52:27.759 --> 52:29.848
Hey, you asshole!

52:32.774 --> 52:35.407
I'm going to get you!

52:47.989 --> 52:51.124
Hey! Asshole!

52:53.006 --> 52:54.551
Goddamn it.

53:08.889 --> 53:10.936
- Give me your hand.
- What?

53:11.020 --> 53:12.232
Your hand, woman!

53:29.747 --> 53:31.586
What do you think you're doing?

54:03.270 --> 54:06.739
I warn you, scoundrel
I was trained to ride
at the King's Academy...

54:06.823 --> 54:09.750
...and schooled in weaponry
by the palace guard.
You stand no chance.

54:09.834 --> 54:14.682
Where you run, I shall ride and when
you stop, the steel of this strap
will be lodged in your brain.

54:39.427 --> 54:41.684
Your boyfriend's a very good rider.

54:42.144 --> 54:43.147
Yeah.

55:03.044 --> 55:04.423
Are you for real?

55:05.469 --> 55:06.472
Pardon me?

55:07.267 --> 55:08.646
Are you for real?

55:10.359 --> 55:11.363
I believe so.

55:13.369 --> 55:14.372
You're a duke.

55:16.713 --> 55:18.343
I was born a duke.

55:18.970 --> 55:20.601
I've never felt like one.

55:26.661 --> 55:28.834
Stay. Sit.

55:30.298 --> 55:32.011
On your feet. Stay.

55:38.658 --> 55:39.661
Stay.

55:40.748 --> 55:41.750
Good boy.

55:48.731 --> 55:51.908
I'm off to dinner.
What are you two doing?

55:52.075 --> 55:56.088
I don't know. Maybe we'll
watch the rest of the game
or go out or something.

55:56.146 --> 55:57.149
Oh, thank you.

55:58.053 --> 56:01.605
Kate, may I repeat my offer
to serve as a chaperone?

56:02.692 --> 56:04.532
No, thank you, Leopold.

56:04.615 --> 56:06.914
Charles, don't you find this inappropriate?
As her brother, I would think...

56:06.998 --> 56:11.094
As her brother, I would think
that my sister would
invite me to an audition.

56:11.179 --> 56:13.351
Could be just me, though.
Seems kind, but...

56:13.686 --> 56:14.688
Charlie.

56:15.734 --> 56:17.741
You're not exactly
a margarine spokesperson.

56:17.824 --> 56:20.290
- I can't sell butter, Kate?
- I don't mean to be insulting...

56:20.373 --> 56:23.217
It's insulting. I'm an actor.
You don't have faith in me to sell butter?

56:23.300 --> 56:24.220
No. No. I'm sorry.

56:24.303 --> 56:25.933
I can do British, Kate. I'm an actor.

56:26.017 --> 56:28.148
- I can be anybody!
- You're a very, very good actor.

56:28.232 --> 56:30.058
- I am a good actor.
- You are.
- Okay, fine.

56:30.059 --> 56:33.361
all right.
A Victorian dude who's never...

56:33.959 --> 56:36.299
- ...seen a Mets game watching TV.
- Okay.

56:36.634 --> 56:40.271
Scene... I say, are those little people
in that box of phosphorous?

56:40.354 --> 56:44.117
Crikey, I believe it is!
This game's more beguiling than cricket!

56:44.199 --> 56:49.215
Good golly, oh, Jesus!
It looks like Mike Piazza just hit a game!

56:49.675 --> 56:54.105
<i>How about Canadian? Oh, right on.
Right on, you like butter, huh?
Yeah, what's that aboot?</i>

56:56.037 --> 56:58.168
- Good night.
- Good night.

56:58.453 --> 57:03.762
<i>...all those people up in that stadium.
Know what they probably could go for?
Some margarine!</i>

57:04.347 --> 57:08.903
When your friend walked in
in that outfit I was getting
a little nervous for you there.

57:10.325 --> 57:14.713
"If you eat his margarine,
maybe your hips will shrink."
It's brilliant.

57:14.797 --> 57:16.804
You saved Phil from his own ambivalence.

57:16.887 --> 57:20.022
I knew it was the way to go... in my gut.

57:20.606 --> 57:22.572
I'm counting on that gut.

57:22.714 --> 57:26.101
Can I get a bottle of your
95 Lynch-Bages and a bottle of Evian?

57:26.380 --> 57:29.599
I'll tell you one thing... your
friend is going to be bigger
than Mr. Whipple.

57:32.269 --> 57:34.275
You're not sleeping with him, are you?

57:35.195 --> 57:36.199
No.

57:37.723 --> 57:38.726
No.

57:43.137 --> 57:44.851
Leo. Leo, come on. Come here.

57:46.022 --> 57:47.024
How's it going, man?

57:52.561 --> 57:56.072
See the girl with the long brown hair?
That's Patrice.

57:57.139 --> 57:59.606
- She's lovely.
- She's mine.

57:59.691 --> 58:00.860
Congratulations.

58:11.602 --> 58:15.031
Hey, everybody, this is Leo!
Leo, this is everybody.

58:15.114 --> 58:17.078
- What's up? Dennis.
- Hello.

58:17.162 --> 58:19.420
Shelby, Allison, Monica.

58:19.627 --> 58:23.348
And this,
this is the insatiable Patrice.

58:23.700 --> 58:26.953
- Hey, Charlie.. Hey.
- How do you do?

58:26.954 --> 58:29.211
- Patrice, let me assist you.
- Thanks.

58:30.036 --> 58:32.711
You got it?
I was going to get it.

58:38.603 --> 58:40.401
Let me get that for you.

58:43.788 --> 58:44.834
There you go.

58:45.403 --> 58:47.367
You look nice tonight. Very...

58:49.004 --> 58:50.634
Like a Judy Blume book.

58:52.566 --> 58:57.415
That's good, because I thought for a moment
that body of water here was a moat.

58:57.583 --> 59:01.261
No, that's a pond.
The gardens are devastating.

59:01.386 --> 59:04.145
They are.
They're very, very beautiful. Ooh.

59:04.576 --> 59:07.418
- You'll have to come
and see them firsthand.
- Right, right.

59:07.490 --> 59:11.294
After the merger I'm going to be stuck
over there, setting things up.

59:11.504 --> 59:15.557
I'll be craving a little face time
from my new top honcho in New York.

59:17.439 --> 59:20.113
- What are you saying?
- I'm saying you should come visit.

59:20.573 --> 59:23.708
- I'll fly you over for the weekend.
- Oh, yeah, I heard that.

59:23.792 --> 59:28.013
The other part... the part before that.
The part about the top honcho.

59:28.097 --> 59:30.062
I didn't understand that, that part.

59:30.480 --> 59:34.326
How about catching an opera Saturday?
La Boheme's at the Met.

59:36.123 --> 59:38.589
Okay, so she comes back...
the audience is about to leave...

59:38.672 --> 59:42.560
...she comes back on stage and she
starts squirting the audience
with this turkey baster...

59:42.643 --> 59:44.065
...filled with this pine mist.

59:44.149 --> 59:47.409
And she's screaming
"Un-sex me! Un-sex me!"

59:47.492 --> 59:51.170
But no tears.
Just raw human passion.

59:51.254 --> 59:55.300
- Isn't Willem Dafoe part of that group?
- Yeah, and he did this
monologue about how...

59:55.301 --> 59:58.819
...all the best things in life are
hidden in people's basements.

59:58.820 --> 01:00:00.283
Like the Louvre.

01:00:04.923 --> 01:00:06.762
I'm sorry.
You were saying, Charles?

01:00:06.845 --> 01:00:09.270
- Just...
- No, what about the Louvre?

01:00:09.562 --> 01:00:11.527
Tell us what you were going to say.

01:00:11.778 --> 01:00:12.698
Well...

01:00:12.781 --> 01:00:16.000
...only a fraction of the
Louvre is on the walls.
The rest is in the basement.

01:00:16.083 --> 01:00:18.758
- You've been in the
basement of the Louvre?
- Oh, yes.

01:00:19.469 --> 01:00:21.727
I was an art history major at Vassar.

01:00:22.981 --> 01:00:25.154
And so, what's down there?

01:00:25.237 --> 01:00:30.212
Well, that's where the real show begins.
Unspoiled by dilettante.

01:00:30.463 --> 01:00:34.934
DaVinci, Michelangelo, David, Chardin.

01:00:36.440 --> 01:00:40.535
"Allow me to assist you, Patrice.
Oh, let me light that for you, Monica."

01:00:40.620 --> 01:00:46.127
"What, this? This is my family crest.
Been in the family for..."
Oh, in the basement?

01:00:46.128 --> 01:00:48.812
"What do they have in the basement?
Why, the works of da Vinci...

01:00:48.813 --> 01:00:51.696
...Michelangelo, Chardin, David...

01:00:51.780 --> 01:00:56.546
...all surrounded by great coral
sponges to absorb the moisture."

01:00:58.259 --> 01:01:00.417
Just for the record, I was working it.

01:01:00.418 --> 01:01:03.459
I was in the zone and I
would have gotten her number

01:01:03.460 --> 01:01:07.788
if you hadn't turned the evening
into a guided tour of the Louvre.

01:01:07.789 --> 01:01:09.336
My apologies.

01:01:10.255 --> 01:01:14.896
Let's get one thing straight. Patrice,
she thought you were cute...
probably gay and cute.

01:01:14.979 --> 01:01:17.780
- And cute, Leo, that's the kiss of death.
- Perhaps.

01:01:17.863 --> 01:01:20.915
- Perhaps? Certainly.
- I believe this is her number.

01:01:21.500 --> 01:01:25.094
As I see it, Patrice has not an inkling of
your affections. And it's no wonder.

01:01:25.178 --> 01:01:27.352
You, Charles, are a merry-andrew.

01:01:27.895 --> 01:01:30.402
- A what?
- Everything plays a farce to you.

01:01:30.487 --> 01:01:32.577
Women respond to sincerity.

01:01:32.661 --> 01:01:35.432
This requires pulling
one's tongue from one's cheek.

01:01:35.433 --> 01:01:39.222
No one wants to be romanced by a buffoon.

01:01:39.223 --> 01:01:41.982
- Now, that number rings her.
- Yes.

01:01:42.065 --> 01:01:46.441
- So ring her tomorrow.
- I can't. She gave the number to you.

01:01:46.442 --> 01:01:49.695
Only because I told her of your affections.

01:01:50.216 --> 01:01:52.307
Wha-What did you say?

01:01:52.390 --> 01:01:55.065
Merely that you admired her
but you were hesitant
to make an overture...

01:01:55.149 --> 01:01:57.949
...since you'll been told
she was courting another.

01:01:58.492 --> 01:02:00.708
Shit. That's good!

01:02:01.377 --> 01:02:04.679
- Wha-What did she say?
- She handed me the napkin.

01:02:08.399 --> 01:02:11.994
- Charles, it's quite late.
- No, no, no, she won't be home yet.

01:02:12.078 --> 01:02:15.088
I get her machine,
I leave a message ball's in her court.

01:02:15.171 --> 01:02:20.186
You're ladling calculation upon comedy.
The point is, to keep
the ball in your court.

01:02:22.277 --> 01:02:24.367
You're right. You're right.

01:02:25.077 --> 01:02:27.836
- Okay.
- Nothing need be done till tomorrow.

01:02:27.920 --> 01:02:30.511
Tomorrow.
Then I make my move.

01:02:30.594 --> 01:02:34.106
An overture, Charles.
Make your intentions known.

01:02:34.189 --> 01:02:37.073
Think of pleasing her, not vexing her.

01:02:37.158 --> 01:02:38.370
No vexing.

01:02:38.495 --> 01:02:42.131
You're intoxicated. We should retire.
I'm sure Kate will be home.

01:02:42.466 --> 01:02:45.058
- I doubt it.
- But it's nearly midnight.

01:02:47.941 --> 01:02:50.199
- You like her, don't you?
- Who?

01:02:50.492 --> 01:02:51.495
Kate.

01:02:52.999 --> 01:02:54.295
- You do!
- Oh, Charles, Charles.

01:02:54.379 --> 01:02:56.259
You like my sister!

01:02:56.343 --> 01:02:58.976
Well, you made your
intentions known, right?
Right?

01:02:59.060 --> 01:03:02.906
- You've been drinking.
- Leo, Commune... right around the corner.

01:03:02.989 --> 01:03:05.497
We could stop in,
you could give me a couple of pointers...

01:03:05.580 --> 01:03:08.674
...pull out a chair or two you could
throw out a gesture here or there.

01:03:08.757 --> 01:03:11.599
Yeah, see, it's one thing with Patrice.
You don't give a shit.

01:03:11.683 --> 01:03:15.446
It's a whole other ball of wax
when it's a girl you like, huh?

01:03:15.729 --> 01:03:18.488
Yeah, who's the merry-andrew now?

01:03:21.226 --> 01:03:23.777
You want to vex my sister!

01:03:24.475 --> 01:03:28.070
I have to confess that
I'm a little bit confused.

01:03:28.823 --> 01:03:30.035
No. Thank you.

01:03:30.119 --> 01:03:34.884
When you asked me to dinner tonight
I was under the impression
that we were here to discuss...

01:03:34.967 --> 01:03:38.060
- The merger.
- Yes. Right. Yes.

01:03:38.394 --> 01:03:41.446
- And a possible promotion.
- Yes.

01:03:42.073 --> 01:03:43.536
Yes, that, too.

01:03:43.829 --> 01:03:48.594
And, well, dinner is winding down
and we haven't really discussed...

01:03:48.844 --> 01:03:52.439
...anything even remotely relevant
to what I thought we came here to...

01:03:52.524 --> 01:03:57.288
I don't believe I've ever
seen you this flustered, Kate.
You haven't even kissed me yet.

01:03:59.504 --> 01:04:01.719
Yeah.
Right. Well...

01:04:02.848 --> 01:04:05.356
I like you, J.J., I do.
I like you quite a bit.

01:04:05.439 --> 01:04:09.452
Um, as a matter of fact
I think you would agree that a working...

01:04:09.536 --> 01:04:13.382
...a successful working relationship
requires a great deal of...

01:04:13.673 --> 01:04:16.516
What exactly is our working relationship?

01:04:16.684 --> 01:04:17.937
Hi, Kate!

01:04:19.233 --> 01:04:20.445
Hi, Charlie.

01:04:21.156 --> 01:04:23.329
Well... what are you doing here?

01:04:23.580 --> 01:04:26.340
- We just thought we'll
come by to say hi. J.J., right?
- Right.

01:04:26.423 --> 01:04:28.889
- Kate. Might I have a word with you?
- Now?

01:04:28.972 --> 01:04:32.232
- In private.
- No! No.

01:04:32.317 --> 01:04:34.072
Mr. Margarine.

01:04:35.201 --> 01:04:37.374
Please... please join us.

01:04:38.043 --> 01:04:40.425
- And where did you say it is?
- In Sussex.

01:04:40.509 --> 01:04:42.056
- Near Ballmour.
- Yes.

01:04:42.139 --> 01:04:44.940
- Built in the 18th century.
- Early 18th century.

01:04:45.023 --> 01:04:47.029
Really? Are you quite sure?

01:04:49.162 --> 01:04:51.628
- Yes.
- He's got pictures, Leopold.

01:04:51.712 --> 01:04:53.843
Perhaps you were swindled,
because I can assure you...

01:04:53.926 --> 01:04:57.396
...as of the late 19th century
there's nothing but farmland near Ballmour.

01:04:57.479 --> 01:04:59.403
- You're mistaken.
- That's not possible.

01:04:59.485 --> 01:05:02.455
Well, it's quite possible,
Leopold, that you are mistaken.

01:05:02.538 --> 01:05:05.422
No, it is not.

01:05:05.505 --> 01:05:08.599
...the only manor house in the county.
I know because I grew up there.

01:05:08.682 --> 01:05:10.898
Leopold, it wasn't...

01:05:11.065 --> 01:05:13.447
- Leo, do you enjoy opera?
- I do. And do you?

01:05:13.530 --> 01:05:16.373
Oh, yes.
It keeps... keeps me alive.

01:05:17.209 --> 01:05:20.302
- Do you have a favorite?
- Boheme. La Boheme.

01:05:20.637 --> 01:05:25.110
I've seen it 12 times.
That's... that's how
I learned to speak French.

01:05:25.361 --> 01:05:27.367
- You speak French?
- Fluently.

01:05:37.357 --> 01:05:38.611
What did he say?

01:05:43.208 --> 01:05:47.639
"How sweet your face looks gently
encircled by the soft moonlight."

01:05:49.311 --> 01:05:50.482
Oh, I like that.

01:05:50.565 --> 01:05:53.993
From the opening scene of Boheme.
A stunning duet.

01:05:54.202 --> 01:05:57.128
- Andre sings it to Mimi.
- Andre...

01:05:57.588 --> 01:06:00.263
I invited Kate to the Met next week.
She's never been.

01:06:00.347 --> 01:06:03.857
Patrone is singing Andre,
and she turned me down.

01:06:04.067 --> 01:06:06.114
Can you explain that, Leopold?

01:06:07.202 --> 01:06:08.205
Well...

01:06:08.664 --> 01:06:12.468
La Boheme is one of man's
great achievements and
should not be missed.

01:06:12.794 --> 01:06:15.844
But perhaps Kate resists on moral grounds.

01:06:16.163 --> 01:06:17.166
How so?

01:06:17.442 --> 01:06:19.490
- Should we get the check?
- Well...

01:06:19.575 --> 01:06:22.040
...some feel that to court
a woman in one's employ...

01:06:22.124 --> 01:06:26.555
...is nothing more than a serpentine effort
to transform a lady to a whore.

01:06:30.944 --> 01:06:31.988
J.J.

01:06:36.629 --> 01:06:38.342
This guy's charming, Kate.

01:06:40.140 --> 01:06:43.066
The Duke of Margarine thinks me a serpent.

01:06:43.400 --> 01:06:45.490
- No, he doesn't.
- No, not a serpent.

01:06:45.573 --> 01:06:48.542
That's too grand a word.
Simply a braggart and a cad...

01:06:48.625 --> 01:06:51.802
...who knows less French
than I, if that's possible.

01:06:53.558 --> 01:06:57.946
And by the way there's
no Andre in Boheme...
it's Rudolfo.

01:06:58.239 --> 01:07:00.957
And though it takes place in France
it's rarely played in French...

01:07:01.040 --> 01:07:04.634
...as it is written in Italian.
Good night.

01:07:13.488 --> 01:07:14.490
Sorry.

01:07:25.501 --> 01:07:27.549
Kate, might I have a word?

01:08:24.890 --> 01:08:26.645
- Morning.
- Hi.

01:08:26.854 --> 01:08:29.740
- You want some coffee?
- No, thanks.

01:08:30.408 --> 01:08:33.000
- You want to read...
you want to read your paper?
- No, thank you, Charlie.

01:08:33.082 --> 01:08:36.720
I want to go to work and try and
clean up this mess you made.

01:08:37.514 --> 01:08:38.769
You sure you don't...

01:08:47.505 --> 01:08:50.054
Kate...
Uh, Kate!

01:08:50.640 --> 01:08:55.196
- What?
- I-I just thought maybe you'll want
a-a kiwi for-for-for the subway.

01:08:55.822 --> 01:09:00.002
- That's a papaya, Charlie.
- Oh. You're right. Okay.

01:09:02.928 --> 01:09:04.955
But while using the product...

01:09:04.956 --> 01:09:08.856
...80% found the product too soft to be...

01:09:09.783 --> 01:09:10.787
<i>...effective.</i>

01:09:10.871 --> 01:09:14.884
<i>This, of course, presents a conundrum
for us marketeers.</i>

01:09:15.134 --> 01:09:22.495
<i>How do we maintain a soft feel
on the exterior of a plastic wrap
or pack while retaining...</i>

01:09:22.496 --> 01:09:27.255
<i>...the useful tensile strength
in the sheets?</i>

01:09:27.256 --> 01:09:29.554
<i>Now, I'm going to suggest
to the Summer Soft people...</i>

01:09:29.639 --> 01:09:32.051
<i>...to scale back to a limited
release of the product...</i>

01:09:32.053 --> 01:09:36.033
<i>...in the mid-Atlantic states,
where we can refine the product...</i>

01:09:36.033 --> 01:09:38.118
<i>...on the basis of extensive...</i>

01:09:40.675 --> 01:09:42.555
<i>Dearest Katherine...</i>

01:09:43.475 --> 01:09:45.983
<i>I behaved as an imbecile last night...</i>

01:09:46.066 --> 01:09:48.448
<i>...animated in part by drink...</i>

01:09:48.741 --> 01:09:52.837
<i>...in part by your beauty and
in part by my own foolish pride.</i>

01:09:52.921 --> 01:09:56.181
<i>And for that I am profoundly sorry.</i>

01:09:56.391 --> 01:09:58.690
<i>Please accept as a gesture of apology...</i>

01:09:58.773 --> 01:10:02.200
<i>...a private dinner on the
rooftop tonight at 8:00.</i>

01:10:04.207 --> 01:10:06.548
<i>Okay, where are we on Farmer's Bounty?</i>

01:10:07.092 --> 01:10:08.094
<i>Kate?</i>

01:10:09.098 --> 01:10:10.812
<i>Care to share with us?</i>

01:10:13.069 --> 01:10:14.490
Farmer's Bounty?

01:10:14.866 --> 01:10:16.120
Where we are.

01:10:16.705 --> 01:10:18.796
Where we are is good.

01:10:19.088 --> 01:10:21.721
Um, as you know,
we found our spokesperson.

01:10:21.805 --> 01:10:25.609
The response room final showed
a 96 in the top two boxes.

01:10:25.901 --> 01:10:28.410
His key female descriptors...

01:10:29.329 --> 01:10:32.924
were "handsome", "romantic"
with several write-ins of...

01:10:33.719 --> 01:10:34.804
"What a hunk."

01:10:38.065 --> 01:10:39.068
Great.

01:10:44.836 --> 01:10:45.840
J.J.?

01:10:46.216 --> 01:10:47.111
J.J., hi.

01:10:47.112 --> 01:10:49.581
Um, listen, I just want to apologize again

01:10:49.582 --> 01:10:54.418
for what happened last night.
There was no need
for things to get that way.

01:10:54.659 --> 01:10:55.955
I appreciate that.

01:10:56.165 --> 01:10:58.421
So... everything's okay?

01:10:59.592 --> 01:11:00.637
Yes, Kate.

01:11:04.135 --> 01:11:05.928
I didn't jump; I fell.

01:11:05.929 --> 01:11:08.754
There's a difference...
a subtle difference,
but nonetheless a difference.

01:11:08.795 --> 01:11:11.882
- So, why did you fall down there?
- Because there was no elevator.

01:11:12.090 --> 01:11:13.498
And you feel that was your fault?

01:11:13.539 --> 01:11:14.619
Look...

01:11:28.818 --> 01:11:30.097
You know what, I'm sorry.

01:11:30.098 --> 01:11:33.374
I got to concede that you
are a very busy man...

01:11:33.375 --> 01:11:36.803
...and I'm sure there are plenty
of people clamoring for your
particular brand of attention.

01:11:36.886 --> 01:11:38.767
Unfortunately, I am not one of them.

01:11:38.850 --> 01:11:42.404
So if you don't mind,
would you please unlock this door?

01:11:42.487 --> 01:11:45.036
I'm concerned you might
be a danger to yourself.

01:11:46.040 --> 01:11:48.381
And in such cases...

01:11:48.464 --> 01:11:52.644
- Will someone please open... Aah! Aah!
- ...state law requires
that I keep you under...

01:11:55.278 --> 01:11:56.657
Fuck!

01:11:57.828 --> 01:11:59.960
Everything all right, Dr. Geisler?

01:12:00.044 --> 01:12:02.468
Yes, Gretchen. Everything's fine.

01:12:03.973 --> 01:12:08.445
Stuart, I'm going to prescribe
something called Prolixin.

01:12:09.072 --> 01:12:12.332
It's a mild antipsychotic.
Nothing too strong.

01:12:16.554 --> 01:12:19.981
"I was wondering... I was wondering
if you would like to accompany me..."

01:12:20.149 --> 01:12:23.744
"If you've already been
previously engaged I understand."

01:12:26.963 --> 01:12:29.554
Tonight at 7:00, 7:30.
Please don't be late.

01:12:31.978 --> 01:12:35.406
I got to talk to you about this, okay?
âCause there's some shit
here that just cannot be said.

01:12:35.489 --> 01:12:38.080
Did you assemble a bouquet for Patrice?

01:12:38.165 --> 01:12:41.467
Look, you just can't tell a woman she's...
"gracefully serene".

01:12:41.550 --> 01:12:43.306
No, no, this will not do.

01:12:43.640 --> 01:12:46.023
Wha... Why?
What is wrong with this one?

01:12:46.441 --> 01:12:49.075
The orange lily implies extreme hatred.

01:12:49.158 --> 01:12:52.586
The begonia and lavender
danger and suspicion, respectively.

01:12:52.711 --> 01:12:55.177
Every flower has a meaning, Charles.

01:12:55.260 --> 01:12:57.768
Might I suggest the amaryllis...

01:12:57.852 --> 01:13:01.196
...which declares the recipient
a most splendid beauty.

01:13:01.279 --> 01:13:03.704
Or the cabbage rose.

01:13:09.497 --> 01:13:10.583
Darci!

01:13:14.489 --> 01:13:17.456
- What is this?
- It's a reply to Leopold's invitation.

01:13:18.836 --> 01:13:20.090
You're going, right?

01:13:20.174 --> 01:13:21.745
I haven't decided yet.

01:13:21.746 --> 01:13:24.797
Oh, you haven't decided if you want
to have dinner on your rooftop with a duke?

01:13:25.566 --> 01:13:29.118
Who thinks he's from 1876! No!

01:13:29.203 --> 01:13:32.004
- And I would appreciate it if...
- Kate, come on, okay?

01:13:32.005 --> 01:13:33.853
I don't know what
this guy did to piss you off...

01:13:33.854 --> 01:13:36.571
...but that is the best apology letter
in the history of mankind.

01:13:36.788 --> 01:13:40.257
Just sign it, Kate.
It's 4:30. We'll fax it.

01:13:42.410 --> 01:13:43.957
Kate McKay's office.

01:13:45.128 --> 01:13:46.298
They hung up.

01:13:49.516 --> 01:13:51.231
Hi. Is Patrice there?

01:13:52.653 --> 01:13:54.035
Hey, Patrice?

01:13:54.036 --> 01:13:56.251
Hi. It's me, Charlie.

01:13:57.333 --> 01:13:59.757
- Hey, Charlie.
- I was just calling to find out...

01:13:59.841 --> 01:14:03.269
...if you got my flowers... your flowers.

01:14:03.938 --> 01:14:06.237
I was calling to see if you got
the flowers I sent you.

01:14:06.320 --> 01:14:07.533
Yeah, I did.

01:14:08.578 --> 01:14:11.671
And I was just wondering if you would
like to go to a movie tonight...

01:14:11.754 --> 01:14:16.059
...and maybe afterwards perhaps
accompany me to dinner?

01:14:16.519 --> 01:14:20.072
I mean, I...
I understand completely
if you're otherwise engaged.

01:14:20.239 --> 01:14:23.960
But, uh, you know,
I just wanted to say that, um...

01:14:25.131 --> 01:14:26.133
Yeah?

01:14:30.606 --> 01:14:33.406
I wanted to say that you've, uh...

01:14:35.246 --> 01:14:37.294
...you've made an impression on me.

01:14:40.261 --> 01:14:42.126
And-and it-it's not
just the way you look...

01:14:42.127 --> 01:14:47.059
I mean, which are great. Your looks are,
you know, top-top shelf. But, uh...

01:14:51.256 --> 01:14:53.345
I don't know, it's, um...

01:14:54.934 --> 01:14:55.936
What?

01:14:59.196 --> 01:15:00.367
You're graceful.

01:15:01.496 --> 01:15:04.380
You know, the way you move and speak.

01:15:06.010 --> 01:15:09.313
I mean, some people have a way
with words and, you know, you...

01:15:09.898 --> 01:15:10.902
...you do.

01:15:13.869 --> 01:15:16.418
The bottom line is, I like you.

01:15:22.103 --> 01:15:23.148
Patrice?

01:15:24.277 --> 01:15:25.572
What about 7:00?

01:15:27.704 --> 01:15:28.791
7:00?

01:15:29.669 --> 01:15:31.758
7:00 would be heaven. Okay.

01:15:31.843 --> 01:15:33.723
See you then.

01:15:34.467 --> 01:15:36.808
It worked! It worked cool!

01:15:37.029 --> 01:15:41.167
Who's going out with Patrice?
Charlie's going out with Patrice!
Charlie's going over there.

01:15:41.594 --> 01:15:44.009
Oh, better go get ready.
Better go get changed.

01:15:44.733 --> 01:15:47.743
Shouldn't change too much, though
âcause she likes me for who I am.

01:15:55.925 --> 01:15:58.391
- Hey.
- Charlie, you look fantastic.

01:15:58.512 --> 01:15:59.808
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:16:00.059 --> 01:16:02.734
I got a date.
I got to go.

01:16:03.068 --> 01:16:04.572
- Bye.
- Bye.

01:16:09.087 --> 01:16:10.591
- Kate?
- Yeah?

01:16:12.347 --> 01:16:13.686
Um, have a good time tonight.

01:16:15.524 --> 01:16:16.528
Bye.

01:17:03.301 --> 01:17:04.639
My God.

01:17:08.234 --> 01:17:09.614
This is beautiful.

01:17:11.536 --> 01:17:13.834
The very word for which I was searching.

01:17:16.677 --> 01:17:17.680
May I?

01:17:36.825 --> 01:17:38.747
She was a real romantic, my mom.

01:17:38.832 --> 01:17:41.799
When Prince Charles and Lady Di
got married, she had a party.

01:17:41.882 --> 01:17:44.558
She made crumpets and jam.

01:17:44.641 --> 01:17:47.776
It was like a Super Bowl party,
but for moms.

01:17:47.943 --> 01:17:49.657
She cried for a week.

01:17:49.741 --> 01:17:52.499
I don't know the story
of Prince Charles and Lady Di.

01:17:52.666 --> 01:17:56.303
Oh, you don't want to.
It's a cautionary tale. Further proof.

01:17:56.428 --> 01:17:58.937
- Of what?
- You can't live a fairy tale.

01:18:18.542 --> 01:18:20.589
I'm not very good with men.

01:18:23.432 --> 01:18:26.022
Perhaps you haven't found the right one.

01:18:31.499 --> 01:18:33.464
Maybe.

01:18:34.048 --> 01:18:37.477
Or, uh, maybe the whole love
thing is just a grown-up
version of Santa Claus...

01:18:37.560 --> 01:18:40.779
just a myth we've
been fed since childhood...

01:18:40.904 --> 01:18:45.125
...so we keep buying magazines
and joining clubs...

01:18:45.502 --> 01:18:48.762
...and doing therapy and
watching movies with hit pop songs...

01:18:48.845 --> 01:18:50.559
...played over love montages...

01:18:50.643 --> 01:18:52.524
...all in this pathetic attempt...

01:18:52.607 --> 01:18:56.285
...to explain why our love Santa
keeps getting caught in the chimney..

01:18:59.463 --> 01:19:02.012
Otis always told me love is a leap.

01:19:03.309 --> 01:19:06.528
Lamentably, I was never inspired to jump.

01:19:08.659 --> 01:19:13.675
By my 30th birthday, I had,
according to my uncle, become
a blemish on the family name.

01:19:14.093 --> 01:19:17.813
So he brought me to this country
with the proviso I marry an American.

01:19:17.897 --> 01:19:20.990
A girl with a good deal of, um...

01:19:22.328 --> 01:19:23.331
Charm?

01:19:24.125 --> 01:19:25.128
Money.

01:19:25.797 --> 01:19:29.768
Since my parents died our family fortune
had become, shall we say, depleted.

01:19:31.022 --> 01:19:35.787
I would be married now
if I hadn't followed Stuart.
I was to announce a bride that night.

01:19:37.919 --> 01:19:38.922
Who?

01:19:43.353 --> 01:19:44.481
I don't know.

01:19:46.990 --> 01:19:49.414
Someone.
One of them.

01:20:01.619 --> 01:20:02.790
What are you doing?

01:20:03.134 --> 01:20:05.005
I'm just cleaning up.

01:20:05.974 --> 01:20:07.973
Would you do me the honor of a dance?

01:20:10.189 --> 01:20:11.192
Please?

01:20:40.032 --> 01:20:41.956
I am not much of a dancer.

01:20:42.039 --> 01:20:44.087
You're doing famously, then.

01:21:02.020 --> 01:21:03.148
Leopold...

01:21:04.361 --> 01:21:05.698
...this was lovely.

01:21:07.286 --> 01:21:12.177
But I don't know if I can leap
even if I am inspired.

01:21:14.282 --> 01:21:16.915
People might think I'm brave, but I'm not.

01:21:17.621 --> 01:21:20.186
The brave are simply those
with the clearest vision...

01:21:20.187 --> 01:21:22.008
...of what is before them.

01:21:22.009 --> 01:21:26.299
Glory and danger alike and
notwithstanding, go out to meet it.

01:21:47.205 --> 01:21:48.209
Hey.

01:21:48.229 --> 01:21:49.688
Morning, Charles.

01:21:50.425 --> 01:21:52.139
How was your evening with Patrice?

01:21:52.906 --> 01:21:53.909
Good.

01:21:54.579 --> 01:21:55.581
Nice.

01:21:56.611 --> 01:21:57.740
How was yours?

01:21:58.660 --> 01:21:59.663
Good.

01:22:00.415 --> 01:22:01.417
Nice.

01:22:13.624 --> 01:22:16.591
So, Leo, don't you think it's
time you tell me who you are?

01:22:18.849 --> 01:22:20.814
- What do you mean?
- I mean...

01:22:21.148 --> 01:22:24.700
...it's a blast doing the
duke thing with you 24/7, but...

01:22:25.494 --> 01:22:28.379
...I don't want to see
Kate go through Stuart:
The Sequel.

01:22:28.797 --> 01:22:31.765
I know she seems pretty tough
but she hasn't had it that easy.

01:22:31.890 --> 01:22:35.443
She's always getting
stuck with people who
don't hold up their end.

01:22:36.279 --> 01:22:37.283
Like me.

01:22:38.787 --> 01:22:41.211
- I just don't...
- I understand, Charles.

01:22:41.671 --> 01:22:43.678
- You do?
- Yes.

01:22:44.262 --> 01:22:45.266
So...

01:22:46.854 --> 01:22:47.857
...who are you?

01:22:52.288 --> 01:22:54.461
I am the man who loves your sister.

01:23:02.404 --> 01:23:03.908
Okay, door's open.

01:23:04.661 --> 01:23:06.082
Shut the lid.

01:23:06.542 --> 01:23:07.963
Push the drawers in.

01:23:08.924 --> 01:23:10.305
Close the door, and...

01:23:10.805 --> 01:23:12.311
...you push this button.

01:23:12.436 --> 01:23:16.031
A word to the wise:
Don't press that till she wakes up.

01:23:16.199 --> 01:23:18.204
So she sees you doing it.

01:23:18.330 --> 01:23:20.962
Oh, clever.
The proverbial tree in the woods.

01:23:21.047 --> 01:23:23.095
If a man washes a dish
and no one sees it...

01:23:23.179 --> 01:23:24.850
- Did it happen?
- Right.

01:23:38.394 --> 01:23:40.776
- A cup of coffee, my dear.
- Thank you.

01:23:44.078 --> 01:23:45.081
Breakfast?

01:23:52.313 --> 01:23:56.075
Nine-grain toast with strawberries
and mascarpone, madame.

01:23:58.248 --> 01:23:59.252
It's...

01:23:59.461 --> 01:24:01.300
...apparently low...

01:24:02.386 --> 01:24:04.059
...in polyunsaturates.

01:24:14.676 --> 01:24:15.846
It's really good.

01:24:18.104 --> 01:24:19.190
It's good.

01:24:23.453 --> 01:24:25.042
What should we do today?

01:24:31.312 --> 01:24:33.569
Oh no, no, no, no, no, no.

01:24:34.740 --> 01:24:36.160
Thank you. No.

01:24:38.418 --> 01:24:41.302
You know what makes me happy?
You don't look good in those.

01:24:41.385 --> 01:24:44.772
They're so completely
inappropriate for you.

01:25:04.084 --> 01:25:05.087
Kate.

01:25:05.713 --> 01:25:06.967
Kate, Kate, come.

01:25:10.144 --> 01:25:11.189
Leopold?

01:25:12.025 --> 01:25:13.153
Leopold?

01:25:13.656 --> 01:25:16.498
- Hey, what are you doing?
- It boggles the mind
that it is still here.

01:25:16.581 --> 01:25:19.758
This is my uncle's home.
Well, was. This is where I lived.

01:25:19.925 --> 01:25:20.971
Good Lord.

01:25:21.054 --> 01:25:23.938
A portrait of my parents... and me.

01:25:27.198 --> 01:25:28.410
Uh... uh, Leopold?

01:25:30.375 --> 01:25:34.263
Look, I just don't think that we should
just be barging around here like that.

01:25:35.558 --> 01:25:36.562
Leopold?

01:25:50.523 --> 01:25:51.860
My old quarters.

01:26:03.355 --> 01:26:04.651
What are you doing?

01:26:14.850 --> 01:26:17.734
The place where I put
everything I most cared for.

01:26:23.127 --> 01:26:25.718
Things I didn't want my uncle to touch.

01:26:36.503 --> 01:26:37.839
My mother's ring.

01:26:40.098 --> 01:26:41.644
Oh, it's beautiful.

01:26:52.554 --> 01:26:54.643
You know, I live on an island...

01:26:55.897 --> 01:26:58.447
...connected to everything by bridges...

01:26:59.074 --> 01:27:01.039
...and I never cross them.

01:27:02.218 --> 01:27:05.227
I've lived here for ten years, and I've...

01:27:05.668 --> 01:27:08.176
...never been to the other side
of anything.

01:27:08.730 --> 01:27:10.778
You've never traveled?

01:27:11.697 --> 01:27:12.701
No.

01:27:25.701 --> 01:27:26.704
Do you...

01:27:27.707 --> 01:27:28.711
What?

01:27:32.527 --> 01:27:34.813
Do you miss where you're from?

01:27:43.054 --> 01:27:44.259
In a way, I...

01:27:45.479 --> 01:27:46.809
I miss...

01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:49.213
I miss its rhythm.

01:27:51.338 --> 01:27:52.550
It was slower?

01:27:53.914 --> 01:27:55.335
Quite a bit slower.

01:27:56.206 --> 01:27:58.128
- Like today?
- Yes.

01:28:11.984 --> 01:28:14.784
- Do you hear that, Leopold?
Do you hear that music?
- Yes.

01:28:15.017 --> 01:28:18.235
Have you ever seen
the movie Breakfast a Tiffany's?

01:28:18.660 --> 01:28:20.658
- Uh, no.
- "No."

01:28:22.214 --> 01:28:23.343
Not yet.

01:28:25.183 --> 01:28:28.776
- You see that guy
down there with the light on?
- Mm-hmm.

01:28:28.777 --> 01:28:31.726
He listens to the soundtrack...

01:28:31.727 --> 01:28:37.564
...of Breakfast at Tiffany's every night
until exactly midnight.

01:28:37.765 --> 01:28:41.317
And then he turns his light off...
goes to sleep.

01:29:04.868 --> 01:29:09.030
Oh, that means it's Sunday.
Oh, I don't want it to be Sunday.

01:29:10.117 --> 01:29:14.130
I want more of this.
More 1876.

01:29:15.049 --> 01:29:18.519
But, Kate, you don't work on Sundays.
We can have more.

01:29:19.815 --> 01:29:24.246
Well, oh, no, âcause Sunday
is the day before
the day I work, so...

01:29:25.207 --> 01:29:27.046
...it gets poisoned.

01:29:28.216 --> 01:29:29.220
I see.

01:29:30.934 --> 01:29:34.988
Besides, tomorrow is the day
we shoot your commercial.

01:29:47.569 --> 01:29:48.573
Kate.

01:29:51.415 --> 01:29:52.460
Would you...?

01:29:54.508 --> 01:29:56.055
Might you ever...

01:29:57.643 --> 01:29:58.855
...consider...?

01:30:11.981 --> 01:30:13.360
It's time for bed.

01:30:21.176 --> 01:30:24.144
- I'm so relaxed.
- That's all right.

01:30:45.546 --> 01:30:48.430
- You're tucking me in.
- Yes.

01:30:50.143 --> 01:30:51.607
Huh, you're my Otis.

01:30:52.234 --> 01:30:53.697
Yes, Your Grace.

01:31:02.099 --> 01:31:03.144
Oh, wait.

01:31:03.895 --> 01:31:06.154
Hey, hey, don't... don't go upstairs.
Stay.

01:31:52.133 --> 01:31:54.557
I love you, Kate McKay.

01:32:07.097 --> 01:32:08.904
Scone, Your Grace?

01:32:08.905 --> 01:32:10.494
Ah, thank you, Millard.

01:32:11.507 --> 01:32:14.892
- And you brought the Farmer's Bounty?
- But of course.

01:32:18.341 --> 01:32:20.473
Ah! Fresh creamery butter.

01:32:20.723 --> 01:32:22.981
Is there anything more comforting?

01:32:23.231 --> 01:32:24.652
I say there is...

01:32:25.322 --> 01:32:29.628
...and perhaps you'll agree when
you sample fat-free Farmer's Bounty...

01:32:29.878 --> 01:32:33.976
...with the genuine essence
of creamery butter in every bite.

01:32:34.602 --> 01:32:37.278
With every mouthful of Farmer's Bounty...

01:32:37.361 --> 01:32:41.039
...you shall receive butter's
luxurious comfort in your mouth...

01:32:41.123 --> 01:32:43.715
...without adding to the luxury
of your waistline.

01:32:44.800 --> 01:32:47.477
- Farmer's Bounty.
- Now, on this one

01:32:47.560 --> 01:32:50.235
...take a bite and smile.

01:32:54.248 --> 01:32:56.543
And... cut! All right, check gate.

01:32:56.544 --> 01:33:00.232
Good enough for me.
Can we get a Dedo up here and something...

01:33:00.353 --> 01:33:02.192
Oh, excuse me. Excuse me.

01:33:02.357 --> 01:33:05.282
Is this an actual sample
of Farmer's Bounty?

01:33:05.367 --> 01:33:06.788
Yeah. Why?

01:33:07.415 --> 01:33:11.553
- This tastes like saddle soap.
- Well, that's not really
your concern, now, is it?

01:33:11.678 --> 01:33:15.147
Not my concern?
This product tastes like raw suet.

01:33:15.231 --> 01:33:18.199
- How is that not my concern?
- Hey, pal, it's a paycheck!

01:33:18.283 --> 01:33:20.038
- Wait a minute.
- Paycheck?

01:33:20.290 --> 01:33:23.466
A... This is an outrage!
Don't worry about the taste. Come back.

01:33:23.550 --> 01:33:26.643
- We need another shot.
- Something that brings
the light up on this...

01:33:32.704 --> 01:33:33.790
Leopold.

01:33:34.584 --> 01:33:35.630
Leopold!

01:33:37.093 --> 01:33:38.012
Leopold!

01:33:38.095 --> 01:33:41.607
Leopold, what's going on?
What are you doing?
They-they need you back in there.

01:33:41.732 --> 01:33:42.694
Do they?

01:33:42.778 --> 01:33:46.121
Yeah. They have to shoot
the rest of the spot.
They're not finished yet.

01:33:46.205 --> 01:33:47.793
Well, I want no part of it.

01:33:49.591 --> 01:33:52.057
- Why?
- Have you tasted it?

01:33:52.350 --> 01:33:54.899
- Farmer's Bounty?
- Yes, Farmer's Bounty.

01:33:55.192 --> 01:33:57.532
- Yeah, I've tasted it.
- It's revolting.

01:33:57.838 --> 01:33:59.121
I know.

01:33:59.790 --> 01:34:03.134
You know it's revolting yet you
have no qualms enlisting
me to endorse it?

01:34:03.510 --> 01:34:05.057
It's diet...

01:34:05.349 --> 01:34:08.024
...it's supposed to be awful.
I mean, what is the problem?

01:34:08.108 --> 01:34:10.365
The problem is that for no reason
beyond my affection for you...

01:34:10.448 --> 01:34:13.960
...I find myself peddling pond scum
to an unsuspecting public.

01:34:14.252 --> 01:34:17.052
Hey, listen, you know
the stakes are very high for me here.

01:34:17.137 --> 01:34:19.979
- You can't just quit because...
- Yes, I can. And so can you.

01:34:20.146 --> 01:34:23.364
When one finds oneself participating
in an endeavor entirely without merit...

01:34:23.448 --> 01:34:25.455
- ...one withdraws.
- No. No.

01:34:25.831 --> 01:34:28.632
Because sometimes you have to
do things that you don't like.

01:34:28.715 --> 01:34:32.896
Sometimes you have to suck it
up and finish what you
started. It's part of life.

01:34:33.313 --> 01:34:34.777
You sound like my uncle.

01:34:35.110 --> 01:34:36.783
Look, Leopold...

01:34:36.866 --> 01:34:39.750
...Jansen Foods is a very important
account for my company.

01:34:39.833 --> 01:34:42.677
If you don't go back in there
then I get into a lot of trouble.

01:34:42.760 --> 01:34:44.976
Is this what you do at work, Kate?

01:34:45.770 --> 01:34:48.069
Research methods to deceive people?

01:34:48.319 --> 01:34:50.493
Refine lies until they resemble truth?

01:34:50.577 --> 01:34:52.625
It's no wonder you dread your work week.

01:34:54.088 --> 01:34:56.679
- Oh! Man, I don't have time for this.
- What has happened to the world?

01:34:57.599 --> 01:35:00.525
You have every convenience,
every comfort yet no time for integrity.

01:35:00.609 --> 01:35:03.702
No. What I don't have time
for are pious speeches..

01:35:03.785 --> 01:35:07.629
...by 200-year-old men who've
never had to work
a day in their life.

01:35:07.630 --> 01:35:09.188
You have no idea
what I've done with my life.

01:35:09.189 --> 01:35:12.980
And you-you have no idea
what I've done with mine!

01:35:12.981 --> 01:35:16.257
I haven't had all that many
comforts and conveniences, Leopold...

01:35:16.298 --> 01:35:19.222
...because I've been
paying dues all of my life...

01:35:19.502 --> 01:35:21.968
...and I'm tired, and I need a rest...

01:35:22.052 --> 01:35:26.524
...and if I have to peddle a little
pond scum to get one then so be it.

01:35:32.126 --> 01:35:33.129
Very well.

01:35:42.450 --> 01:35:44.457
We're kidding ourselves, Leopold.

01:35:47.424 --> 01:35:50.769
In point of fact I don't even
really know who you are.

01:35:54.071 --> 01:35:57.247
You still don't believe
I'm the man I say I am?

01:35:59.420 --> 01:36:01.970
We had a great weekend; that's that.

01:36:02.179 --> 01:36:05.105
And now it's Sunday.
It's over.

01:36:25.503 --> 01:36:29.976
There's such a lot of world...

01:36:30.059 --> 01:36:32.735
...to see...

01:37:25.486 --> 01:37:26.490
I know.

01:37:28.848 --> 01:37:31.631
I know, I know, it sounds crazy...

01:37:31.817 --> 01:37:32.904
...talking about...

01:37:33.526 --> 01:37:37.160
...finding a crack in time
under the East River.

01:37:41.223 --> 01:37:44.232
But in, in point, in point fact,
Gretchen you know...

01:37:46.715 --> 01:37:49.801
...it is no more crazy than, uh...

01:37:49.802 --> 01:37:52.479
a dog finding a rainbow.

01:37:55.252 --> 01:37:57.258
Dogs are color-blind, Gretchen.

01:37:58.301 --> 01:37:59.638
They don't see color.

01:38:00.014 --> 01:38:02.439
- Really?
- Just like we can't see time.

01:38:02.690 --> 01:38:04.027
We can feel it.

01:38:05.031 --> 01:38:07.287
Oh... we can feel it passing...

01:38:07.497 --> 01:38:09.753
...but, uh, we can't see it;
it's just a blur.

01:38:10.381 --> 01:38:11.760
It's like, uh...

01:38:12.429 --> 01:38:15.898
...it's like we're riding in a,
in a supersonic train...

01:38:16.483 --> 01:38:19.743
...and the world is just blowing by.

01:38:20.914 --> 01:38:23.548
But imagine if we could stop that train,
Gretchen. Hmm?

01:38:24.551 --> 01:38:26.933
Imagine if we could stop that train...

01:38:27.226 --> 01:38:28.229
...get out...

01:38:28.564 --> 01:38:31.615
...look around and see time
for what it really is.

01:38:32.785 --> 01:38:34.081
A universe...

01:38:35.084 --> 01:38:38.971
...a world a thing as unimaginable as...

01:38:39.306 --> 01:38:40.811
...color to a dog.

01:38:41.313 --> 01:38:42.901
And as real...

01:38:43.109 --> 01:38:45.826
...and tangible as that chair
you're sitting in.

01:38:47.792 --> 01:38:50.174
Now, if we could see it like that...

01:38:50.675 --> 01:38:52.556
...I mean, really look at it...

01:38:53.016 --> 01:38:54.019
...then...

01:38:55.524 --> 01:38:59.453
...maybe we could see
the flaws as well as the form.

01:39:03.048 --> 01:39:04.219
And that's it.

01:39:05.765 --> 01:39:07.019
It's that simple.

01:39:07.521 --> 01:39:09.903
That's all I discovered. I'm just a...

01:39:11.576 --> 01:39:14.538
...just a guy who saw a crack in a chair...

01:39:14.539 --> 01:39:17.799
...that no one else could see.

01:39:18.306 --> 01:39:21.356
I'm that dog who saw a rainbow.

01:39:22.485 --> 01:39:23.990
Only, uh...

01:39:27.836 --> 01:39:30.092
...none of the other dogs believe me.

01:39:34.565 --> 01:39:35.945
I believe you.

01:40:21.046 --> 01:40:22.425
I can see that some...

01:40:23.471 --> 01:40:25.351
things have...

01:40:25.352 --> 01:40:27.901
...happened since I went away.

01:40:28.570 --> 01:40:29.573
But...

01:40:33.210 --> 01:40:34.715
...you have to go back.

01:41:02.135 --> 01:41:04.811
You understand you'll be going back
to the same day you left...

01:41:05.229 --> 01:41:06.650
- ...April 28.
- Yes.

01:41:06.776 --> 01:41:09.450
So you understand you might
be repeating a few things.

01:41:10.078 --> 01:41:11.874
You might even see me.

01:41:12.293 --> 01:41:14.090
Just don't follow me this time.

01:41:19.817 --> 01:41:20.987
Can I go in?

01:41:25.669 --> 01:41:28.511
- J.J., you asked to see me?
- Come on in.

01:41:31.688 --> 01:41:35.618
I understand you, uh,
put out a fire at the shoot yesterday.

01:41:35.743 --> 01:41:38.334
Guess Mr. Duke's got
a bit of an ego on him, huh?

01:41:38.592 --> 01:41:39.755
Yeah.

01:41:40.795 --> 01:41:43.094
I'm going to England this week...

01:41:43.838 --> 01:41:45.386
...and I made a decision.

01:41:47.198 --> 01:41:49.539
You're going to be the top New York honcho.

01:41:50.372 --> 01:41:53.549
So, this is going to be your office.

01:41:53.799 --> 01:41:56.015
I'll be making it official tonight.

01:41:58.398 --> 01:42:00.613
Thank you, J.J.
Thank you.

01:42:01.539 --> 01:42:02.661
You earned it.

01:42:03.958 --> 01:42:05.508
I'm heading over to Jansen to sign...

01:42:05.509 --> 01:42:08.889
the buy-out papers, FTC stuff. So...

01:42:08.890 --> 01:42:10.896
...I'll see you later at the thing.

01:42:11.941 --> 01:42:13.529
- What did he say?
- I got it.

01:42:13.655 --> 01:42:17.458
- Oh, my God, that's wonderful!
- Just give me one second,
I'm sorry, Darci. One second.

01:42:22.390 --> 01:42:25.150
Hi. You've reached Stuart.
Please leave a message.

01:42:25.608 --> 01:42:26.612
Hello?

01:42:27.449 --> 01:42:31.420
Leopold, I-I don't know where you are
but if you're there, please pick up.

01:42:33.056 --> 01:42:34.555
I got it.

01:42:35.767 --> 01:42:37.523
I got the job.

01:42:38.192 --> 01:42:42.748
I'm the new senior vice president at CRG.

01:42:44.002 --> 01:42:45.841
Uh, please call me. I, um...

01:42:46.301 --> 01:42:48.892
I'm sorry about the way
things came down yesterday.

01:42:48.975 --> 01:42:50.774
I apologize. I, uh...

01:42:51.525 --> 01:42:53.699
I just really need to see you.
I'll love to see you tonight...

01:42:53.783 --> 01:42:58.047
...but I have this thing
at Farmer's Bounty.
But I'll love to see you later.

01:42:58.924 --> 01:43:00.429
I miss you.

01:43:00.972 --> 01:43:02.310
I miss you.

01:43:05.487 --> 01:43:06.657
Hey, Stuart.

01:43:07.661 --> 01:43:09.124
How you feeling?

01:43:17.651 --> 01:43:18.653
Where's Leo?

01:43:20.033 --> 01:43:21.203
He went home.

01:43:51.926 --> 01:43:53.390
He was for real.

01:43:56.817 --> 01:43:58.196
He was for real.

01:44:10.277 --> 01:44:11.488
Holy shit!

01:44:13.745 --> 01:44:14.790
Look at this!

01:44:25.450 --> 01:44:26.788
Oh, my God.

01:44:34.069 --> 01:44:36.280
Chilled, do you understand? Chilled.

01:44:36.281 --> 01:44:39.288
And be sure to leave another
case of the Chateau Marid.

01:44:39.289 --> 01:44:40.203
Yes, sir.

01:44:40.204 --> 01:44:41.208
Leopold!

01:44:41.500 --> 01:44:43.716
Leopold!
Where have you been?

01:44:44.677 --> 01:44:48.356
Otis, I demand explication!
It's half past 5:00! He's not even dressed!

01:44:48.440 --> 01:44:50.069
He'll be ready, my lord, I assure you.

01:44:50.153 --> 01:44:52.829
I don't want him ready.
I want him resplendent!

01:44:52.954 --> 01:44:56.340
Here's the invitation.
You've got your table number,
your car number...

01:44:56.424 --> 01:45:00.686
...and I've got Morty down there the guy
you like. He's on the Madison side.
Also, your phone sheet is in here.

01:45:00.770 --> 01:45:02.986
And Stuart called you a couple times. So...

01:45:03.194 --> 01:45:05.535
have a great time tonight.
You look beautiful.

01:45:44.033 --> 01:45:47.503
I don't think this is right.
I'm supposed to be going to 2640 Madison.

01:45:47.711 --> 01:45:49.467
That's where we are, Miss McKay.

01:45:51.892 --> 01:45:53.480
Have a nice evening.

01:45:54.859 --> 01:45:55.862
Hello.

01:45:56.364 --> 01:45:58.203
Hello. Invitation, please.

01:46:04.348 --> 01:46:08.653
They're still plugs.
They're just randomly
seeded with Minoxidil.

01:46:08.737 --> 01:46:10.659
- No cornrows.
- Excuse me.

01:46:10.743 --> 01:46:12.958
Hey, Kate. Congratulations.

01:46:13.041 --> 01:46:14.004
Thank you.

01:46:14.087 --> 01:46:15.592
The hell with facelifts.

01:46:15.675 --> 01:46:18.351
I'm into mini-lifts now.
Just a tiny little bit each year.

01:46:18.435 --> 01:46:22.237
I hear they're bringing
back the 840 next year.
So I'm just running out the lease.

01:46:22.321 --> 01:46:24.369
- Kate, congratulations.
- Thanks, Bob.

01:46:25.790 --> 01:46:27.338
- Hey, Kate.
- J.J. Hi, Barry.

01:46:27.421 --> 01:46:29.261
- Congratulations.
- Thank you. Thank you very much.

01:46:29.262 --> 01:46:31.197
Anyway, I'm just glad
they've got them fixed.

01:46:31.198 --> 01:46:33.999
I was going to move
my office down to the lobby.

01:46:36.784 --> 01:46:37.871
Excuse me.

01:46:40.776 --> 01:46:44.119
Kate, don't powder your nose for too long.
I'm going to give this
speech in a couple minutes.

01:46:44.518 --> 01:46:45.688
Okay.

01:46:49.198 --> 01:46:52.375
All this time I thought
that I had pretzled fate...

01:46:52.458 --> 01:46:54.967
...and it had to be untwisted.
But what I never considered...

01:46:55.050 --> 01:46:57.726
...is that the whole thing is a pretzel.

01:46:57.935 --> 01:47:01.195
A beautiful 4D pretzel
of kismetic inevitability.

01:47:01.279 --> 01:47:04.079
Okay, you know what, get off Park
as soon as you can, and then go up Madison.

01:47:04.164 --> 01:47:06.002
I was supposed to go back.

01:47:06.211 --> 01:47:09.848
He was supposed to come forward
then he was supposed to
go back again and...

01:47:11.190 --> 01:47:12.403
...so was she.

01:47:14.479 --> 01:47:16.498
<i>Now it is my pleasure and honor...</i>

01:47:34.041 --> 01:47:36.191
...to take priests to the bell tower.

01:47:36.192 --> 01:47:38.760
You speak of progress and invention.

01:47:38.761 --> 01:47:41.980
But what I offer you
down the stairs is reality.

01:47:42.708 --> 01:47:44.757
Take a wife. Marry.

01:47:44.862 --> 01:47:47.415
Let us not bother with this banter, Uncle.

01:47:47.416 --> 01:47:50.634
Tell me whom you want me to marry.
Well, who has the most money.

01:47:51.355 --> 01:47:52.359
Well...

01:47:52.986 --> 01:47:55.786
...that would be Miss Tree
of the Trees of Schenectady.

01:47:55.912 --> 01:47:56.914
Good.

01:47:57.081 --> 01:47:58.168
Consider it done.

01:47:59.214 --> 01:48:02.056
Otis, fetch the ring.
I will announce at midnight.

01:48:03.476 --> 01:48:06.529
- Invitation, please.
- Uh, hello. My name is Stuart Besser.

01:48:06.613 --> 01:48:09.664
I'm sorry, I know we're not on your list
but his sister is Kate McKay;

01:48:09.748 --> 01:48:12.465
- ...she works here.
- I'm sorry, sir, I can't just let you in.

01:48:16.769 --> 01:48:20.531
...and I learned that there was
one thing that I could do...

01:48:20.615 --> 01:48:24.879
...and it didn't require money
and it didn't require a fancy school.

01:48:25.631 --> 01:48:27.972
I learned that I could please people.

01:48:28.139 --> 01:48:31.190
And there is nothing wrong with that!

01:48:31.274 --> 01:48:33.572
I am a people pleaser, people!

01:48:37.084 --> 01:48:39.884
Thank you so much.
I am so...

01:48:40.051 --> 01:48:40.972
Kate!

01:48:41.055 --> 01:48:43.981
Stuart!
Charlie! What are you doing?

01:48:44.064 --> 01:48:45.695
Take a look at these pictures, Kate.

01:48:45.779 --> 01:48:47.451
- No! No-no-no-no!
- Now it's time to introduce the woman...

01:48:47.534 --> 01:48:49.875
...who's going to be holding down
the fort in our New York offices...

01:48:49.958 --> 01:48:53.678
...our own little rising star,
Miss Kate McKay!

01:48:53.762 --> 01:48:57.106
- They're introducing me downstairs right now!
- Just listen to me for a second, okay, please?

01:48:57.190 --> 01:48:59.155
I'm sorry I was a lousy boyfriend.

01:48:59.238 --> 01:49:02.540
I'm sorry I let you down.
I know all you wanted
was someone you could trust...

01:49:02.624 --> 01:49:05.967
Oh, Stuart, really I can't talk about
our relationship right now.

01:49:06.051 --> 01:49:07.097
Please.

01:49:07.515 --> 01:49:10.231
Maybe we weren't such
a waste of time after all.

01:49:10.357 --> 01:49:13.826
- I mean, maybe there's
a reason I was your guy.
- What are you talking about?

01:49:13.910 --> 01:49:18.173
Maybe I was supposed
to help you find your guy...
Leopold.

01:49:20.179 --> 01:49:21.768
You got to go back, Kate.

01:49:22.603 --> 01:49:24.109
You got to go back there.

01:49:25.990 --> 01:49:27.161
Go back?

01:49:28.373 --> 01:49:29.375
How?

01:49:29.668 --> 01:49:33.137
You have to jump off the Brooklyn Bridge
within the next 23 minutes.

01:49:33.974 --> 01:49:34.977
Kate?

01:49:36.565 --> 01:49:37.652
Kate!

01:49:37.819 --> 01:49:39.658
Kate, just look at the pictures, okay?

01:49:54.958 --> 01:49:58.385
- Is there a... a Kate McKay in the house?
- Yeah.

01:49:58.593 --> 01:50:00.307
- Here I am!
- Kate?

01:50:02.438 --> 01:50:03.944
Here she is. Here she is.

01:50:05.448 --> 01:50:09.002
Well, without further ado
the new senior vice president...

01:50:09.085 --> 01:50:10.249
...of our New York offices.

01:50:10.250 --> 01:50:13.218
Here she is, ladies and gentlemen...
Kate McKay.

01:50:18.114 --> 01:50:20.581
- You okay?
- Yeah. I'm sorry.

01:50:21.037 --> 01:50:23.506
- Thank you.
- Quite an entrance, huh?

01:50:23.590 --> 01:50:26.432
Thank you, J.J.
Thank you very much.

01:50:27.175 --> 01:50:28.175
Wow.

01:50:29.011 --> 01:50:30.015
Well...

01:50:30.446 --> 01:50:32.033
...it's a great night.

01:50:32.536 --> 01:50:34.166
We here at...

01:50:34.960 --> 01:50:40.519
...CRG have always considered ourselves
to be in the "Find what people want"
business and at Jansen...

01:50:40.979 --> 01:50:43.613
...you guys are in the
"Make what people want" business.

01:50:43.696 --> 01:50:46.288
So, imagine what we can do together.

01:50:46.831 --> 01:50:50.635
We'll be able to find out
exactly what people want...

01:50:50.718 --> 01:50:53.143
...and make it for them.

01:50:53.227 --> 01:50:56.362
So... yeah, so our customers...

01:50:57.073 --> 01:51:00.333
...will be able to get exactly...

01:51:07.522 --> 01:51:08.650
...what they...

01:51:12.162 --> 01:51:13.499
...they want.

01:51:40.502 --> 01:51:41.798
And, uh...

01:51:44.305 --> 01:51:46.019
...it's a great thing to...

01:51:46.897 --> 01:51:50.116
...to get what you want.
Uh, it's a really good thing.

01:51:50.241 --> 01:51:53.287
Unless what you thought
you wanted wasn't really...

01:51:53.288 --> 01:51:56.509
...what you wanted
because what you really...

01:51:56.636 --> 01:51:57.639
...wanted...

01:51:59.061 --> 01:52:02.698
...you couldn't imagine,
or you didn't think it was possible.

01:52:04.746 --> 01:52:05.749
But...

01:52:06.000 --> 01:52:09.552
...but what if someone
came along who knew...

01:52:09.636 --> 01:52:11.977
...exactly what you wanted without asking?

01:52:12.061 --> 01:52:13.942
They just knew. Like they could...

01:52:14.358 --> 01:52:16.214
hear your heart beating...

01:52:16.215 --> 01:52:17.929
or listen to your thoughts...

01:52:19.250 --> 01:52:21.968
And what if they were sure of themselves...

01:52:22.302 --> 01:52:24.685
...and they didn't have to take a poll...

01:52:24.893 --> 01:52:26.606
...and they loved you...

01:52:27.275 --> 01:52:29.616
...and you hesitated?

01:52:35.385 --> 01:52:36.555
And...

01:52:37.099 --> 01:52:38.478
I have to go.

01:52:40.317 --> 01:52:41.655
I, uh...

01:52:43.160 --> 01:52:45.333
I'm sorry, but I have to go.

01:52:47.799 --> 01:52:48.803
Kate?

01:52:55.156 --> 01:52:57.246
Stuart, can you tell me...

01:52:57.330 --> 01:53:01.050
...in short, complete sentences
featuring no words over two syllables...

01:53:01.133 --> 01:53:03.265
...why exactly I am in these pictures?

01:53:03.349 --> 01:53:04.854
- Probably not.
- Try.

01:53:04.938 --> 01:53:06.692
- Because you were there.
- I wasn't.

01:53:06.776 --> 01:53:09.326
I would remember.
Believe me, I would
remember if I was there.

01:53:09.410 --> 01:53:12.210
- Because you're going to be there.
- If we get there in time.

01:53:12.293 --> 01:53:15.137
These are pictures of the past,
not the future.

01:53:15.220 --> 01:53:18.480
Not exactly. Theoretically speaking
if you go to the past in the future...

01:53:18.564 --> 01:53:20.403
...then your future lies in the past.

01:53:20.486 --> 01:53:24.749
And that is a picture of you
in the future in the past.

01:53:24.876 --> 01:53:27.219
We have to make a run for it. Let's go.

01:53:29.724 --> 01:53:31.062
Come on, come on.

01:53:31.689 --> 01:53:33.319
Let's go, let's go. Come on!

01:53:33.403 --> 01:53:37.583
Whoa, where the hell
do you think you're going?
$6.80 on the meter, pal.

01:53:38.920 --> 01:53:40.760
It's going to close, Kate!
Come on!

01:53:49.036 --> 01:53:51.752
Ladies and gentlemen,
may I have your attention?

01:53:52.039 --> 01:53:53.376
The Duke of Albany...

01:53:53.503 --> 01:53:55.592
...will be making
a very important announcement...

01:53:55.849 --> 01:53:58.478
...in 20 minutes from this very stage.

01:53:58.479 --> 01:54:00.671
And I believe it shall be
an announcement...

01:54:00.672 --> 01:54:02.182
...that will justify...

01:54:02.183 --> 01:54:03.979
...the playing of a bridal waltz.

01:54:13.823 --> 01:54:15.871
Okay... this is the hard part.

01:54:15.955 --> 01:54:17.460
- What?
- The girder.

01:54:17.543 --> 01:54:20.093
- The girder?
- You have to cross the girder, Kate.

01:54:22.643 --> 01:54:24.356
That girder?

01:54:24.983 --> 01:54:28.810
- Stuart, I can't cross that girder.
I can't go across...
- You love him, right?

01:54:28.811 --> 01:54:29.900
What?

01:54:29.901 --> 01:54:31.028
Leopold.

01:54:31.837 --> 01:54:33.552
You love him, right?

01:54:35.604 --> 01:54:36.608
Yeah.

01:54:37.566 --> 01:54:39.573
That's all you need to know.
Now go.

01:54:40.199 --> 01:54:41.955
- You'll be fine.
- Katie...

01:54:42.708 --> 01:54:43.586
Charlie...

01:54:43.669 --> 01:54:46.804
- Charlie, what am I... How are you...
- No, don't worry about me.

01:54:47.891 --> 01:54:49.772
- Now, Kate, now.
- Now?

01:54:49.898 --> 01:54:51.276
The portal's going to close.

01:54:51.611 --> 01:54:52.614
- All right.
- Go.

01:54:54.411 --> 01:54:55.582
- Jesus.
- Whoo!

01:54:56.878 --> 01:54:57.923
Oh, God.

01:54:58.256 --> 01:54:59.260
You can do it.

01:55:00.765 --> 01:55:01.936
Don't look down.

01:55:07.076 --> 01:55:08.080
Shit.

01:55:24.507 --> 01:55:25.636
Charlie...

01:55:28.812 --> 01:55:30.651
I'll love you forever.

01:55:32.324 --> 01:55:33.494
Love you.

01:55:38.301 --> 01:55:39.305
It's okay.

01:55:44.445 --> 01:55:46.368
Lady... lady, what are you doing?

01:55:46.451 --> 01:55:48.458
- Step back, lady.
- It's okay.

01:55:48.543 --> 01:55:51.133
Step back from there, lady.
Come back, lady.

01:55:54.477 --> 01:55:56.693
Central, be advised
This is Breech Post Four.

01:55:56.776 --> 01:55:59.243
I've got a jumper on the southwest
location of the bridge.

01:55:59.326 --> 01:56:03.423
Have a supervisor, ESU and Harbor
respond to this location forthwith.

01:56:23.988 --> 01:56:25.452
Ladies and gentlemen...

01:56:25.535 --> 01:56:29.380
...it is with a glad heart and a bright eye
that I proudly introduce...

01:56:29.464 --> 01:56:32.515
...my beloved nephew Leopold...

01:56:32.682 --> 01:56:34.145
...Duke of Albany.

01:56:34.313 --> 01:56:37.576
Thank you, Uncle Millard.
Thank you.

01:56:37.657 --> 01:56:39.559
I'm sorry, madam,
but this is a private affair.

01:56:39.560 --> 01:56:41.710
No, you don't seem to understand.

01:56:41.711 --> 01:56:44.512
I need to get inside.
I need to get inside right now and...

01:56:44.595 --> 01:56:46.309
What seems to be the problem?

01:56:46.694 --> 01:56:48.575
- Are you Otis?
- Well...

01:56:48.740 --> 01:56:51.625
...let us proceed.
Please raise your glasses...

01:56:53.274 --> 01:56:55.698
...so we may toast to my bride-to-be...

01:56:56.720 --> 01:57:01.653
...the woman whose welfare and happiness
shall be my solemn duty to maintain.

01:57:02.402 --> 01:57:05.704
The future Duchess of Albany...

01:57:10.595 --> 01:57:12.016
...Kate McKay...

01:57:16.990 --> 01:57:19.163
Of the McKays of...?

01:57:21.380 --> 01:57:22.716
Massapequa.

01:57:25.768 --> 01:57:26.939
...Massapequa.

01:57:36.260 --> 01:57:38.308
- I love you.
- I love you.
