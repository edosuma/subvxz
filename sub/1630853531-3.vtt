01:42.560 --> 01:46.272
<i>My dad always says a hunter</i>
<i>is only as good as her gut.</i>

01:46.356 --> 01:48.608
<i>Shouldn't this gut thing guide me?</i>

01:48.691 --> 01:49.818
<i>Give me confidence?</i>

01:50.360 --> 01:52.070
<i>Or is it supposed to weigh me down</i>

01:52.153 --> 01:54.572
<i>with guilt for doing what I know</i>
<i>isrightfor me?</i>

02:04.749 --> 02:05.583
Juliette?

02:08.211 --> 02:09.337
What are you doing here?

02:11.923 --> 02:12.757
Where are we?

02:14.634 --> 02:15.468
Eden.

02:16.344 --> 02:17.178
The beginning.

02:19.472 --> 02:23.685
I swear, when I bit you,
I had no idea it would link us like this.

02:27.313 --> 02:28.565
You don't believe me.

02:29.983 --> 02:31.317
I don't know what to believe.

02:33.570 --> 02:34.612
Or how to feel.

02:36.030 --> 02:38.741
I mean, I shouldn't feel anything for you.

02:41.035 --> 02:42.954
-But?
-But you're nothing like the monsters

02:43.037 --> 02:43.872
I grew up hating.

02:46.249 --> 02:47.542
So just go with it.

02:49.169 --> 02:51.004
Anything is possible here.

03:10.315 --> 03:11.149
Juliette.

03:19.908 --> 03:21.201
Run.

03:33.671 --> 03:36.382
Up, up, baby girl.
The whole fam's already outside.

03:40.428 --> 03:42.889
Nice. Nice form, Apollo.

03:42.972 --> 03:44.140
Keep your distance.

03:44.224 --> 03:48.019
Legacy blood touches your skin,
you're done, paralyzed instantly.

03:49.354 --> 03:51.189
-Good.
-All right.

03:55.485 --> 03:59.280
-That's some flash right there, Apollo.
-You're telegraphing, Theo.

04:01.616 --> 04:02.825
You're telegraphing, Theo.

04:06.496 --> 04:07.872
Good.

04:10.416 --> 04:14.504
Protect your neck. Let's go. Hoo! Winner.

04:15.380 --> 04:17.966
-There's a first time for everything.
-I don't know, Dad.

04:18.049 --> 04:21.469
Sure he's ready for the Guild Academy?
You might want to send your baby boy.

04:21.552 --> 04:23.763
I'm almost 24. Guild Academy age.

04:23.846 --> 04:26.891
-You'll never be ready.
-Please. I was born ready.

04:29.477 --> 04:33.189
You're too impressed with yourself.
The worst thing a hunter can be.

04:33.273 --> 04:35.483
That childish need for glory
will get you killed.

04:36.192 --> 04:38.236
Maybe our whole family killed.

04:38.820 --> 04:41.698
Should I say I'm sorry about
the Shambler again?

04:42.365 --> 04:43.825
That's where this is going next?

04:43.908 --> 04:46.953
You're quick and strong, son.
But you're reckless.

04:47.036 --> 04:50.248
A bit of your brother's humility
would go a long way.

04:50.832 --> 04:53.626
-You're lookout on tonight's hunt.
-What?

04:53.710 --> 04:55.753
Are you kidding me? You saw me.
I beat him.

04:56.713 --> 04:58.214
And now you'll watch him.

05:00.591 --> 05:01.676
Wow.

05:03.511 --> 05:04.846
-All right.
-Cal.

05:04.929 --> 05:07.807
-Tess. You're up.
-Watch her.

05:08.850 --> 05:10.518
-Sorry.
-For what?

05:11.519 --> 05:13.229
Embarrassing you in front of the fam.

05:14.856 --> 05:16.941
-Keep your eyes on her shoulders.
-Never die.

05:18.776 --> 05:20.153
-Come on.
-Good.

05:20.236 --> 05:21.821
-Let's go, T.
-You got this.

05:28.453 --> 05:29.370
Good.

05:30.955 --> 05:31.956
That's Guild.

05:35.251 --> 05:36.085
Good.

06:18.378 --> 06:20.588
<i>Welcome to</i>
<i>Savannah's number one station</i>

06:20.671 --> 06:22.298
<i>for news you need to know.</i>

06:23.674 --> 06:27.428
<i>Savannah high school student</i>
<i>Ashley Stanton will be laid to rest today.</i>

06:27.512 --> 06:28.888
What did you do with them?

06:28.971 --> 06:31.891
<i>Sources close to the family</i>
<i>say Ashley was an outgoing girl--</i>

06:33.684 --> 06:36.187
It's rude to enter
and not at least offer--

06:36.270 --> 06:37.897
Where are my pills?

06:37.980 --> 06:41.567
Calm down.
It's not like you need them anymore.

06:42.235 --> 06:44.028
Unless you haven't had your first kill

06:44.112 --> 06:46.697
and this entire consecration
ceremony is celebrating a--

06:46.781 --> 06:47.740
Elinor.

06:50.868 --> 06:51.869
Please.

07:03.840 --> 07:06.926
Hear me on this.
They won't solve your problem.

07:11.431 --> 07:12.557
Where are the rest?

07:23.192 --> 07:25.445
-It's not enough.
-Exactly.

07:26.696 --> 07:28.322
But I tossed the rest.

07:28.906 --> 07:31.617
Motivation to get you to do
the right thing.

07:33.911 --> 07:35.788
Why do I even have to have this ceremony?

07:37.290 --> 07:38.833
Because you lied, Jules.

07:39.709 --> 07:41.335
Because it's our tradition.

07:41.419 --> 07:43.838
So kill someone before Grandmother

07:43.921 --> 07:46.591
and the entire Legacy community
arrive for the big show.

07:46.674 --> 07:48.134
I know it's tradition.

07:49.051 --> 07:52.388
But I hate that it is.
I mean, Oliver never had to do it.

07:53.681 --> 07:57.268
We're a matriarchy.
That's the part worth embracing.

07:57.351 --> 07:58.895
Really worth embracing.

07:59.437 --> 08:02.231
And Oliver almost destroyed this family.

08:02.315 --> 08:04.484
Do you really want to follow
in his footsteps?

08:10.072 --> 08:11.491
So cute.

08:12.116 --> 08:16.537
Now put those away and let's find
a little concealer before the big fitting.

08:30.760 --> 08:32.386
I look like I sleep in a coffin.

08:33.930 --> 08:37.391
Well, perhaps this isn't your era.

08:38.059 --> 08:39.560
Let's try something else.

08:54.784 --> 08:56.452
-No.
-No.

09:01.499 --> 09:05.378
Buttercup, can you at least attempt
to be happy?

09:05.461 --> 09:07.421
We are doing all of this for you.

09:08.381 --> 09:11.175
Well, if it were for me,
my friends would be invited.

09:11.259 --> 09:14.470
The guests wouldn't be from Madrid
and Tokyo and Lagos.

09:15.263 --> 09:16.889
There wouldn't be a...

09:16.973 --> 09:19.517
creepy snake ritual
or human sacrifice hunt.

09:21.644 --> 09:25.439
And this is why children are not entrusted
to uphold tradition.

09:25.523 --> 09:28.192
I thought you were going to call
when you got to the hotel.

09:28.276 --> 09:29.235
Surprise.

09:30.319 --> 09:32.530
-Grandmother.
-Hello, my darling.

09:34.490 --> 09:37.326
You're keeping your hands clean
and your bodies well-buried?

09:37.410 --> 09:38.828
Just like you taught me.

09:39.662 --> 09:40.746
Juliette.

09:41.622 --> 09:43.332
That dress is hideous on you.

09:44.166 --> 09:45.459
Let me look at you.

09:45.543 --> 09:48.129
Well, you have your father's eyes,

09:48.212 --> 09:51.090
but you have
your mother's thirst, I'm told.

09:51.173 --> 09:55.970
Grandmother, please tell your daughter
that this moth trap belongs in a museum.

09:57.680 --> 10:01.559
This moth trap was my consecration gown.

10:02.476 --> 10:06.397
You see what happens when you procreate
with a vampire you've made?

10:06.480 --> 10:09.650
They lack
the respect-for-their-elders gene.

10:13.279 --> 10:15.406
-Sorry, I didn't mean to--
-Darling.

10:16.782 --> 10:21.162
For a thousand years, our family has been
the most powerful among Legacies.

10:21.996 --> 10:25.374
The only ones deemed worthy of guarding
the Emerald Malkia,

10:25.458 --> 10:29.754
the queen mother serpent
from which all Legacies draw strength.

10:29.837 --> 10:32.632
So when you descend those stairs tonight,

10:33.507 --> 10:38.512
when that serpent travels
from my arm to yours, you--

10:38.596 --> 10:41.307
-Shit. I forgot to cancel with Ben.

10:43.017 --> 10:44.769
That's Juliette's human.

10:46.479 --> 10:48.022
It's so lovely to see you, Mother.

10:52.026 --> 10:56.697
Well, I certainly hope he tastes better
than he behaves.

10:58.658 --> 11:00.660
She doesn't feed from him.

11:00.743 --> 11:03.079
-He's her friend.
-Darling...

11:05.831 --> 11:07.500
do your grandmother a favor.

11:08.209 --> 11:10.336
Make sure she doesn't disappoint me.

11:11.587 --> 11:14.090
Not easy. She's allergic to listening.

11:15.299 --> 11:19.387
So wrangling your little sister
is above your abilities then, yes?

11:22.473 --> 11:23.724
I'll take care of it.

11:24.433 --> 11:25.267
Good girl.

11:34.110 --> 11:37.655
Oh, my God, you're like a two-year-old.
What are you doing?

11:37.738 --> 11:41.409
Wondering where's my invitation
to that masquerade ball.

11:41.492 --> 11:42.618
It's just a dinner.

11:42.702 --> 11:45.955
It's a pretty elaborate dress
for meatloaf and potatoes.

11:48.374 --> 11:50.084
Savannah Blooms Florist.

11:51.502 --> 11:53.879
-That's a lot of flowers for a--
-Grandmother.

11:53.963 --> 11:56.716
She's in town. Fancy's kind of her thing.

11:58.509 --> 11:59.427
Enough already.

12:00.594 --> 12:01.762
Admit and Forget.

12:04.598 --> 12:05.433
Fine.

12:07.935 --> 12:10.980
Your parents are having a party
and I'm not invited.

12:13.149 --> 12:14.066
Admit.

12:16.777 --> 12:17.611
Okay.

12:20.531 --> 12:21.824
Forgive and forget.

12:23.033 --> 12:23.868
Thank you.

12:23.951 --> 12:27.163
I guess this means you're not coming
with me to visit Ashley's parents,

12:27.246 --> 12:28.122
pay our respects?

12:28.748 --> 12:30.666
You know death freaks me out.

12:31.417 --> 12:32.877
Does it look like I can go?

12:32.960 --> 12:36.881
You look like you should be
frantically teaching the Beast to waltz

12:36.964 --> 12:38.966
before the last petal falls.

12:39.049 --> 12:41.969
So go get changed,
I need you for investigative purposes.

12:44.638 --> 12:46.557
I think Ashley was murdered.

12:49.810 --> 12:52.229
What? Who on earth would...?

12:54.106 --> 12:56.525
You're traumatized
because you stumbled onto her body.

12:56.609 --> 12:58.778
Discovered. Not stumbled onto.

12:58.861 --> 13:00.571
-And what if I'm right?
-Okay.

13:00.654 --> 13:03.407
If she was murdered,
her parents should know.

13:03.491 --> 13:05.493
I'm wearing a dress
that weighs as much as I do

13:05.576 --> 13:08.370
and as I stand here sweating buckets,
you're talking nonsense.

13:08.454 --> 13:12.416
Leave Ashley's parents to their grief.
Go home. I'll call you later.

13:13.250 --> 13:15.586
I say a girl was murdered.

13:15.669 --> 13:18.631
You say, "My dress is heavy, go home"?

13:20.174 --> 13:24.136
-Okay, yeah, I can do that.
-No, you know I didn't mean it that way.

13:25.471 --> 13:26.722
-Really?

13:26.806 --> 13:28.974
-Come on.

13:29.058 --> 13:30.059
Admit and Forget.

13:31.477 --> 13:34.814
Fine. I admit I hate you right now.

13:37.608 --> 13:39.443
That is not how the rules work.

13:42.655 --> 13:44.698
You're supposed to say, "Forgive."

13:53.916 --> 13:57.962
Her intensity reminds me
of another badass hunter.

14:00.047 --> 14:02.716
Yeah, she's been at it
for a couple of hours.

14:02.800 --> 14:05.594
-Good. She has a lot to learn.
-Yeah.

14:05.678 --> 14:08.055
Your training sessions with her
have been paying off.

14:08.722 --> 14:10.266
I can see that myself.

14:14.895 --> 14:16.355
She's only 16, Jack.

14:18.065 --> 14:20.651
Theo was 12. Apollo, 14.

14:20.734 --> 14:23.320
And Cal was 15 when
that damned wraith almost killed her.

14:23.404 --> 14:26.824
Then we moved here,
she faced a Legacy and won.

14:26.907 --> 14:30.244
Okay, that's not exactly how it happened
and you know it.

14:30.327 --> 14:34.290
Well, I know the Guild rewarded us
for her actions.

14:34.373 --> 14:37.835
By sending us to hunt monsters
we don't know how to kill?

14:37.918 --> 14:39.587
-No.
-Just because we haven't

14:39.670 --> 14:41.380
-doesn't mean we can't.
-Jack.

14:41.463 --> 14:46.260
And plus, they sent us our best friends
Mike and Sarah, who are damn good hunters.

14:48.470 --> 14:50.306
-Baby--
-Jack.

14:51.515 --> 14:55.769
Cal ID'd a family of Legacies
that no one knew existed.

14:55.853 --> 14:58.397
The Guild is entrusting us
to take them out.

14:59.023 --> 15:03.068
We haven't been promoted to
Helmers yet and they're giving it to us.

15:03.152 --> 15:05.988
I know Blades don't get
this kind of opportunity,

15:06.071 --> 15:09.033
but it's a dangerous assignment,
even for the best of us,

15:09.116 --> 15:10.409
let alone for a first hunt.

15:10.492 --> 15:14.163
No, I'm not letting her anywhere near
this one, you hear me?

15:15.372 --> 15:17.791
Baby, one, it's not the first hunt.

15:17.875 --> 15:19.960
And two, it's been almost 400 years

15:20.044 --> 15:23.297
since a hunter squared off with a Legacy
and lived to tell the tale.

15:23.380 --> 15:24.548
Until Cal.

15:24.632 --> 15:25.966
Our baby girl.

15:26.050 --> 15:28.010
Doesn't she deserve to finish it?

15:28.093 --> 15:30.012
Not if it puts her life at risk.

15:30.554 --> 15:33.515
What I'm saying is that
if she's not with us when we're out there,

15:33.599 --> 15:35.267
then we're not a family.

15:35.351 --> 15:37.478
-You understand?
-Okay. Stop.

15:37.561 --> 15:39.772
She is our daughter first.

15:39.855 --> 15:40.689
I know that.

15:40.773 --> 15:42.983
No, sometimes I think you forget.

15:43.067 --> 15:46.737
Sometimes you put our duties
as hunters before everything else.

15:46.820 --> 15:50.699
And sometimes I want you to respect
how I feel.

15:50.783 --> 15:54.411
Respect my position,
instead of always trying to think of ways

15:54.495 --> 15:57.081
to bring me around to yours,
because it's exhausting.

15:57.164 --> 15:59.083
And I don't know why you can't see that.

15:59.166 --> 16:01.502
Why you can't see how frustrating
that is for me.

16:03.462 --> 16:05.589
All right. All right.

16:06.757 --> 16:07.591
I hear you.

16:09.677 --> 16:10.844
And I'm sorry.

16:11.845 --> 16:12.805
You should be.

16:13.722 --> 16:16.100
Get out of my kitchen
unless you wanna make dinner.

16:16.183 --> 16:17.184
Happy to.

16:18.143 --> 16:20.396
But first, can I get a little dessert?

16:40.457 --> 16:42.292
Brushing up on our history?

16:43.419 --> 16:48.007
And so Eve fled the serpent
while Lilith embraced its bite.

16:49.466 --> 16:51.427
I always found that part a bit kinky.

17:00.227 --> 17:01.645
Will the snake really bite me?

17:05.232 --> 17:07.776
Only if you've committed your first kill.

17:09.862 --> 17:10.946
Oh.

17:11.905 --> 17:12.740
Okay.

17:16.201 --> 17:20.706
If you haven't had your first kill,
it'll reject you,

17:20.789 --> 17:23.250
in front of the entire Legacy community.

17:23.333 --> 17:25.169
Our family will be humiliated.

17:25.252 --> 17:28.630
A scramble for control
of the mother serpent would follow.

17:29.757 --> 17:30.924
Pure anarchy.

17:31.884 --> 17:34.178
Come on, I have a surprise for you.

17:58.535 --> 18:01.789
-Go ahead, it's your play.
-Check this out. Here we go.

18:02.915 --> 18:06.960
So your Uncle Mike goes
from Blade Hunter to Helm status,

18:07.628 --> 18:11.423
and finally I get to kill the monster that
made me start hunting in the first place.

18:11.924 --> 18:13.050
It was a Kitsune.

18:13.926 --> 18:18.180
A demon that can take the form
of everything it kills, killed my brother.

18:18.764 --> 18:20.808
Took me years to track it down.

18:20.891 --> 18:23.852
Fifteen months, honey.

18:23.936 --> 18:27.106
-So, what happened when you found it?
-I didn't.

18:28.607 --> 18:31.568
Walked right up to me one day,
it tapped me on the shoulder,

18:32.361 --> 18:33.654
wearing my brother's face.

18:33.737 --> 18:35.239
Even pretended to be him.

18:37.533 --> 18:38.951
I say all this to say...

18:40.953 --> 18:45.541
I know how hard it is to kill a monster
that looks and feels human.

18:47.584 --> 18:51.421
I respect you, Cal,
which is why I hate to do this.

18:53.340 --> 18:57.427
-Domino!
-Cal, you over there, losing like that?

19:00.472 --> 19:05.269
Well, I think now is a good time
for a toast.

19:05.352 --> 19:08.897
Now, the Guild sent us here
for one simple mission,

19:09.940 --> 19:12.609
to find out why there
are monsters back in Savannah.

19:13.235 --> 19:16.280
Now, we all know how hard it is
to shock a hunter.

19:16.947 --> 19:19.658
Well, that's because we're trained
to expect the unexpected.

19:20.826 --> 19:23.162
But, Cal, you shocked us all.

19:23.787 --> 19:26.582
You took initiative,
trusted your instincts,

19:26.665 --> 19:29.293
and single-handedly led us to Legacies.

19:30.752 --> 19:34.590
Now, if we win this battle,
we just might be promoted.

19:35.340 --> 19:37.885
Blade class would be
in our rearview mirror.

19:37.968 --> 19:41.889
Which is why we've decided
you're ready for your first kill.

19:41.972 --> 19:42.806
What?

19:42.890 --> 19:45.184
-Let's go, sis.
-Welcome to the hunt.

19:45.267 --> 19:46.894
You're joining the hunt, baby girl.

19:46.977 --> 19:49.855
Yep, you'll have the honor
of killing Juliette.

19:54.610 --> 19:56.612
-Congratulations.
-Congratulations.

19:56.695 --> 19:59.907
-There you go. Proud of you.
-Thank you.

19:59.990 --> 20:02.659
-Baby sis about to show 'em proof.
-Yes, sir.

20:03.452 --> 20:05.454
Theo, Apollo, we're ready.

20:11.501 --> 20:14.254
There's one Guild record
of a Legacy killing.

20:19.343 --> 20:24.806
The tips of these six spears were forged
from the silver stake used by that hunter.

20:26.266 --> 20:29.394
Thought we'd never get a chance
to use 'em. Until now.

20:30.729 --> 20:32.397
Thanks to you, young warrior, we do.

20:34.274 --> 20:35.275
Yo.

20:43.992 --> 20:44.826
Cal.

20:45.827 --> 20:48.455
This silver is from
the only spear to ever...

20:49.623 --> 20:50.832
My princess warrior.

20:51.833 --> 20:53.919
This goes back hundreds of years.

20:54.711 --> 20:56.088
Come here.

20:58.048 --> 20:58.882
Hey.

21:00.217 --> 21:01.677
It's okay to be nervous.

21:01.760 --> 21:03.762
Everybody is the first time.

21:03.845 --> 21:07.224
Once those monsters come for you,
your instincts kick in.

21:10.852 --> 21:12.020
Do you, uh...

21:14.439 --> 21:16.024
-Never mind.
-No, say it.

21:20.737 --> 21:22.155
Do you ever ask yourself

21:22.948 --> 21:26.076
like, what if they're not all monsters?

21:27.202 --> 21:29.121
Like inside?

21:29.204 --> 21:30.580
What does that mean?

21:31.915 --> 21:33.250
I don't know, I just--

21:34.501 --> 21:37.129
Sometimes I think about
how they must see us.

21:37.796 --> 21:41.216
Like, what if maybe we're
the monsters in their story.

21:43.760 --> 21:46.596
-Killers don't get a story, Cal.
-We kill.

21:46.680 --> 21:50.183
To protect people.
They don't feel. They don't love.

21:50.267 --> 21:52.936
The more you hunt,
the clearer that'll become.

21:54.021 --> 21:56.815
Yeah. I'm sure you're right.

21:58.358 --> 21:59.234
Thanks.

22:12.831 --> 22:16.543
-Want to tell me why we're here?
-To save you from yourself.

22:21.381 --> 22:23.258
Oh, Elinor.

22:23.342 --> 22:24.551
Juliette, meet Eve.

22:26.136 --> 22:26.970
Hi.

22:28.805 --> 22:29.639
Shall we?

22:29.723 --> 22:32.184
Oh, are we not having lunch?

22:32.267 --> 22:33.727
-In a bit. Come on.
-Oh.

22:40.275 --> 22:44.112
-We'll all ride over to the rehearsal.
-Oh, and lunch?

22:44.196 --> 22:45.864
I'm kind of famished.

22:45.947 --> 22:47.491
-There's food there.
-Oh.

22:48.241 --> 22:49.117
That's Eve.

22:49.201 --> 22:51.828
At least the actress playing Eve
in tonight's Legacy hunt.

22:52.329 --> 22:54.748
But we can find a replacement. Drink up.

22:56.625 --> 22:58.460
Wait, you want me to bite her?

23:06.301 --> 23:07.135
Okay.

23:08.804 --> 23:10.097
Oops.

23:10.180 --> 23:11.056
Okay.

23:13.517 --> 23:16.520
No, I want you to drain her.

23:17.396 --> 23:19.356
No, I'm not killing anyone.

23:20.065 --> 23:23.485
Your grandmother is a monster.

23:23.568 --> 23:27.864
If she finds out you're weak,
a vampire afraid to kill, she'll shun you.

23:27.948 --> 23:30.534
Just because I'm not a killer
doesn't mean I'm weak.

23:31.451 --> 23:34.871
Finally. The truth. Thank you.

23:37.040 --> 23:38.375
I tried, okay?

23:39.167 --> 23:40.043
I really did.

23:42.254 --> 23:45.006
-I couldn't.
-Couldn't or wouldn't?

23:45.715 --> 23:46.550
Wouldn't.

23:47.717 --> 23:51.179
I mean, I could, but I won't,
because I like her.

23:52.973 --> 23:54.641
Aw, you've got a crush.

23:57.519 --> 23:58.895
Luckily, it'll pass.

24:00.063 --> 24:03.316
Maybe. Maybe it won't.

24:03.400 --> 24:08.155
Okay, so what's your plan,
when the Malkia refuses the bonding bite

24:08.238 --> 24:10.282
because she knows
you haven't made your kill?

24:10.365 --> 24:11.199
Then what?

24:12.659 --> 24:16.872
Sweet little, fate dealt you
a beautiful hand.

24:16.955 --> 24:20.542
You are a Legacy vampire
of Atwood lineage.

24:21.334 --> 24:24.171
I find that to be the coolest thing
in the world.

24:25.088 --> 24:29.092
Made vampires would love
to see their reflection in a mirror,

24:29.176 --> 24:31.928
be able to spend as much time in daylight
as they'd like to,

24:32.971 --> 24:35.056
eat human food and not get ill.

24:35.140 --> 24:37.767
But you and me, we woke up like this.

24:39.060 --> 24:41.438
I'm begging you, free your mind,

24:41.521 --> 24:46.443
stop wishing to be something you'll
never be and appreciate what you are.

24:48.862 --> 24:50.113
You don't understand.

24:56.870 --> 24:59.331
Change of plans. Lunch on me.

25:00.624 --> 25:02.834
Uh, thanks.

25:03.627 --> 25:04.878
See you this evening.

25:07.297 --> 25:08.215
Let's go.

25:22.604 --> 25:24.981
The way you did that was pretty amazing.

25:25.065 --> 25:29.486
Mike, I was just telling Cal here
how you killed that banshee with a wrench.

25:30.320 --> 25:32.072
Greatest freehand kill I ever saw.

25:32.155 --> 25:33.365
It was a lucky shot.

25:33.949 --> 25:36.201
-Can we talk for a minute?
-Yeah, sure.

25:40.288 --> 25:42.749
Listen, man, you my boy.

25:43.833 --> 25:47.003
We go way back.
So I'm gonna be straight with you.

25:48.088 --> 25:49.214
Cal's out the hunt.

25:50.131 --> 25:52.676
-Where's this coming from?
-Me.

25:54.177 --> 25:56.513
-With the Guild's blessing.
-The Guild?

25:57.556 --> 26:00.725
I don't know what
is going on here, but you can't.

26:00.809 --> 26:02.060
She's ready for this.

26:04.104 --> 26:07.691
-This is bullshit, Mike.
-If you don't want to be a Blade,

26:07.774 --> 26:09.693
you'll hear me on this one, man.

26:12.279 --> 26:13.280
Hey, everybody.

26:15.574 --> 26:17.325
We got something we need to deal with.

26:18.785 --> 26:23.498
Earlier today, Cal told Tess
she has doubts about killing vamps.

26:26.084 --> 26:28.795
And she implied we're just as bad
as the monsters we hunt.

26:30.547 --> 26:32.382
Give me a break. Cal wouldn't--

26:33.633 --> 26:34.509
Calliope?

26:39.347 --> 26:43.226
-I was just trying to explain that--
-Yes or no, Calliope.

26:43.935 --> 26:45.270
Tess wouldn't lie.

26:49.649 --> 26:50.734
Hmm?

26:52.319 --> 26:54.946
-Yes.
-Shit.

26:55.030 --> 26:57.907
I don't know. I mean, I didn't.

26:57.991 --> 26:58.867
Not like that.

27:02.454 --> 27:06.416
-You guys see that? She's been bitten.
-What are you talking about?

27:06.499 --> 27:09.461
-If Cal's been bitten, I would know.
-Actually, you wouldn't.

27:09.544 --> 27:11.254
Legacy bites, they disappear.

27:11.338 --> 27:13.465
Leave no physical trace,
and itch like hell.

27:14.549 --> 27:16.509
And the venom can alter the mind,

27:17.510 --> 27:20.138
and make the most devoted hunter
question her beliefs.

27:20.847 --> 27:22.599
I would never go against my family.

27:22.682 --> 27:24.976
-Of course you wouldn't.
-Ever.

27:25.894 --> 27:28.688
We can't take any chances.
We've got good intel.

27:28.772 --> 27:32.067
All the Legacies will be in one location.
We won't get this opportunity again.

27:32.150 --> 27:36.279
Sorry, Talia. The Guild's sending
someone to watch Cal while we hunt.

27:36.363 --> 27:37.530
For her own safety.

28:04.766 --> 28:05.767
It'll be fine.

28:06.935 --> 28:08.019
Don't worry.

28:23.201 --> 28:28.998
Tonight, a young Legacy will bond
with the Emerald Malkia Serpent,

28:29.082 --> 28:32.794
just as Lilith the First Keeper did
in the Garden of Eden.

28:32.877 --> 28:37.048
The Atwood family is honored to uphold
the name of Lilith,

28:37.841 --> 28:40.301
both in practice and in lineage.

28:40.385 --> 28:47.016
Who will present Juliette Anastasia Atwood
at this Legacy consecration?

28:50.228 --> 28:51.062
We will.

28:52.147 --> 28:54.816
Margot and Sebastian present our daughter.

28:54.899 --> 28:59.446
Tonight, Juliette Anastasia
Atwood Fairmont

29:00.029 --> 29:03.241
will take her rightful place
in the line of succession.

29:03.867 --> 29:07.036
<i>It's Ben. The average</i>
<i>person lives 41 million minutes.</i>

29:07.120 --> 29:08.288
<i>Tick-tock.</i>

29:15.503 --> 29:17.046
Jesus, you're a mess.

29:20.175 --> 29:22.927
I swiped this from downstairs.

29:23.928 --> 29:27.390
Drink it now. Mom will kill you
if you get blood on the Valentino.

29:31.394 --> 29:32.937
Yes, well, you're out of options.

29:35.565 --> 29:38.443
No, I'm not.
I'm gonna tell them the truth.

29:39.027 --> 29:40.612
The truth is overrated.

29:42.781 --> 29:45.325
Now, pull yourself together
before your thirst takes over

29:45.408 --> 29:48.328
and you kill whoever happens
to be nearest.

29:48.411 --> 29:50.371
Maybe it'll be a stranger.

29:50.455 --> 29:52.165
Maybe it'll be Ben.

30:16.981 --> 30:17.816
Good.

30:21.236 --> 30:23.363
-We'll figure out your first kill.
-No, I--

30:23.446 --> 30:26.449
Don't worry, we'll honor
your sensibilities, but get it done.

30:27.867 --> 30:32.247
Finish getting ready, go downstairs
and stall the hunt as long as possible.

30:32.330 --> 30:33.581
Wait, stall? Why?

30:33.665 --> 30:37.877
Juliette, we are at the big-sister-
knows-best part of the story.

30:38.920 --> 30:40.880
I got this, if you just trust me.

30:42.757 --> 30:46.678
Okay. Stall. Got it.

30:47.929 --> 30:51.224
As it has been and always will be.

30:51.307 --> 30:56.062
It is time for the mature vampire
to pass through the garden.

30:56.688 --> 30:59.148
A Legacy of the Atwood line.

30:59.858 --> 31:05.822
Allow me to present my granddaughter
Juliette Anastasia Atwood.

31:14.581 --> 31:16.165
Look who's all grown up.

31:18.334 --> 31:19.168
Oliver.

31:19.752 --> 31:20.795
Hey, baby sister.

31:28.636 --> 31:31.097
Her bite marks disappeared.
I didn't think it was important.

31:31.180 --> 31:33.725
-We understand.
-Actually, we don't.

31:35.018 --> 31:37.645
You're part of a family
of Guild-sanctioned hunters.

31:38.438 --> 31:41.190
More importantly, you're my daughter.

31:42.191 --> 31:44.861
Everything that happens to you
is important to me.

31:46.070 --> 31:47.989
Is there anything else
you need to tell us?

31:49.157 --> 31:49.991
Anything.

31:59.584 --> 32:00.418
No.

32:02.003 --> 32:05.089
Okay, sorry, baby girl,
but we have to do what we gotta do.

32:06.257 --> 32:09.218
Juliette and every Legacy
in Savannah dies tonight.

32:09.302 --> 32:10.219
Let's move out.

32:11.804 --> 32:14.766
-So, what are we watching tonight?
-We've got this.

32:15.350 --> 32:17.352
What do you got in your queue?

32:18.144 --> 32:19.771
-Dad.
-It's time to go.

32:23.775 --> 32:25.360
Okay.

32:30.740 --> 32:33.910
You seem nervous.
Are you getting cold feet?

32:35.620 --> 32:36.454
No.

32:39.582 --> 32:42.543
-Oliver.
-We both know you're not like them, Jules.

32:43.336 --> 32:47.298
You know all this Legacy nonsense is,
well, it's nonsense.

32:49.217 --> 32:51.010
Margot. Sebastian.

32:52.345 --> 32:55.974
Look at Margot and Sebastian,
the stupid looks on their faces.

32:56.557 --> 32:58.726
If you hate them so much,
then why did you come?

32:59.519 --> 33:01.437
-For you.
-My darling daughter...

33:03.314 --> 33:04.941
may I have this dance?

33:05.024 --> 33:06.359
Hello, darling.

33:06.442 --> 33:08.403
-A word?
-Of course, Mother.

33:09.529 --> 33:11.531
That was quite the grand entrance.

33:11.614 --> 33:14.492
Make sure your hasty exit
isn't nearly as dramatic.

33:14.575 --> 33:17.578
Oh. Why so ornery?
Afraid I'll embarrass you

33:17.662 --> 33:19.038
and you'll have to send me away?

33:19.122 --> 33:22.875
-Pretend I don't exist?
-We've never denied your existence.

33:22.959 --> 33:25.753
You wanted to upset us. You have.

33:25.837 --> 33:28.756
Now leave before you ruin
your sister's big night.

33:33.177 --> 33:34.595
I think I'll stay.

33:44.105 --> 33:47.608
You look worried.
Are you worried about your family

33:48.651 --> 33:50.069
or your vamp girlfriend?

33:55.241 --> 33:56.159
Here.

33:59.370 --> 34:02.290
My first kill 20 years ago.
Staked that first one.

34:07.462 --> 34:08.796
Sorry not sorry.

34:09.338 --> 34:12.133
My brothers have been pulling
that move on me since I was two.

34:15.386 --> 34:17.346
Wonder what promotion I'd get

34:17.430 --> 34:20.767
if I dragged you out of here
because you started acting,

34:20.850 --> 34:23.061
I don't know, all twitchy.

34:23.144 --> 34:24.604
Excuse me?

34:24.687 --> 34:27.106
You were bit by a Legacy, weren't you?

34:27.190 --> 34:29.108
Who knows how that would affect you.

34:29.192 --> 34:32.111
You might attack me,
I'd have to restrain you...

34:34.113 --> 34:35.198
drag you in.

34:36.741 --> 34:41.037
-Look how erratic you're acting.
-You're invading my personal space.

34:45.208 --> 34:46.167
Get back here!

35:09.941 --> 35:12.151
-Just a minute.

35:18.866 --> 35:20.952
-Can we talk?
-You are my youngest daughter.

35:21.035 --> 35:24.122
When you say, "Can we talk?"
I am supposed to say, "Of course."

35:24.205 --> 35:26.457
No, not with this
surprise appearance from Oliver.

35:26.541 --> 35:29.127
Not with the entire Legacy community
waiting to see you--

35:29.210 --> 35:30.878
It's not my place.

35:33.548 --> 35:34.507
I don't want it.

35:36.092 --> 35:39.929
I have been saying this for months
and nobody is listening to me.

35:41.389 --> 35:44.851
So here I am,
embarrassing the entire family.

35:44.934 --> 35:46.477
I didn't want that either.

35:48.437 --> 35:49.272
I'm sorry.

35:50.606 --> 35:52.567
I know I ruined everything...

35:53.985 --> 35:55.319
but please call it off.

36:06.789 --> 36:08.332
You haven't ruined everything.

36:10.084 --> 36:12.128
I did that a long time ago.

36:12.962 --> 36:17.800
Have you ever wondered why I have
three sisters that you've only met once?

36:17.884 --> 36:22.680
It's because I humiliated my family
by running away with my human plaything.

36:23.598 --> 36:26.309
They have children that I have never met.

36:26.392 --> 36:28.561
Family events
that I have not been invited to.

36:28.644 --> 36:31.689
All because I refused
to marry Henry Davenport.

36:35.443 --> 36:37.570
I'd fallen in love with your father.

36:39.447 --> 36:40.281
So...

36:41.199 --> 36:42.408
on my wedding day...

36:45.328 --> 36:46.370
I ran.

36:52.585 --> 36:55.421
I have had no relationship
with my family since.

36:56.714 --> 37:00.760
They came to Elinor's ceremony
because Mother

37:00.843 --> 37:03.930
is the most revered Legacy.

37:04.013 --> 37:07.600
They didn't come to yours
because she gave them permission not to.

37:07.683 --> 37:11.437
They abhor the fact
that I am Keeper in Waiting.

37:11.520 --> 37:12.355
Their...

37:15.608 --> 37:20.780
disdain... for me, it's palpable.

37:23.532 --> 37:26.202
-You don't deserve to be treated that way.
-Neither do you.

37:28.329 --> 37:30.248
I made choices for my life.

37:30.331 --> 37:32.500
I want you to do the same.

37:34.210 --> 37:37.088
But very soon you are going to have
to make your first kill

37:37.171 --> 37:38.881
or you will get very sick.

37:40.841 --> 37:41.676
You know?

37:45.638 --> 37:48.641
We wouldn't be standing here if you had.

37:49.475 --> 37:54.355
You are a good girl, who loves her family.

37:55.731 --> 37:57.650
If the hard part were done,

37:57.733 --> 38:00.611
you would have gone through
with the easy part, the ceremony.

38:04.865 --> 38:05.700
Okay.

38:08.995 --> 38:11.455
I'll tell your father we have
an announcement to make.

38:11.539 --> 38:12.373
No.

38:14.125 --> 38:15.459
I'm making the choice, right?

38:17.128 --> 38:18.754
I should tell them myself.

38:26.929 --> 38:28.472
It's gonna be all right, Mom.

38:29.223 --> 38:31.684
Well, it'll have to be, sweet girl.

39:04.091 --> 39:06.761
Before the days of recorded history,

39:07.470 --> 39:11.849
Eve and her sister Lilith frolicked
in the Garden of Eden.

39:13.184 --> 39:17.104
As they admired a perfect peach tree,
ripe with fruit,

39:17.938 --> 39:22.360
a serpent slithered down
from his perch atop the highest branch.

39:22.443 --> 39:27.573
Eve, frightened,
begged the serpent not to bite her.

39:27.656 --> 39:28.491
Where is she?

39:28.574 --> 39:31.160
She should have come down
before Mother got all worked up.

39:31.243 --> 39:35.164
-Stay here, for appearances. I'll get her.
-God, unimpressed with Eve's

39:35.247 --> 39:37.625
cowardice, made her human.

39:38.542 --> 39:41.462
But Lilith embraced the snake.

39:41.545 --> 39:47.134
She welcomed its bite,
and so became the first vampire,

39:47.218 --> 39:51.514
the vampire from which
all the Legacies are descended.

39:51.597 --> 39:55.643
And now my granddaughter will receive

39:55.726 --> 40:00.564
the bite of bonding from the Queen Snake,
just as Lilith did.

40:20.960 --> 40:23.921
Behold the Emerald Malkia.

40:24.964 --> 40:27.758
Once she has anointed Juliette
with her venom,

40:28.634 --> 40:31.345
we will release the ceremonial Eve.

40:33.722 --> 40:34.557
And hunt her.

40:37.393 --> 40:41.147
Come, Juliette, step into your Legacy.

40:52.074 --> 40:52.908
Damn.

40:55.828 --> 40:57.163
Where the hell is she?

40:58.956 --> 41:01.041
Oh, my God, you scared me.

41:01.125 --> 41:03.252
The ritual's starting
and I have to get back.

41:03.335 --> 41:04.211
Then we'll hurry.

41:04.295 --> 41:06.797
No, I told Mom everything,
she supports me.

41:06.881 --> 41:09.425
I smell blood. Elinor, I smell--

41:11.886 --> 41:13.137
What did you do?

41:13.220 --> 41:15.514
I scrolled through your phone
and found her.

41:15.598 --> 41:16.974
You're welcome.

41:17.057 --> 41:19.727
I told you Mom knows
and I'm gonna tell everyone the truth.

41:19.810 --> 41:22.229
I told you that
I don't want my Legacy ripped from me

41:22.313 --> 41:24.482
just because you and Mom
don't care about yours.

41:24.565 --> 41:26.984
-Oh, my God.
-I am second in line to be the Keeper.

41:28.027 --> 41:31.071
You know her, you like her, drain her.

41:34.617 --> 41:41.165
No more migraines, burning throat,
tears of blood, sweaty pale skin.

41:42.124 --> 41:45.169
Jules, this really is the way.

41:46.420 --> 41:47.505
No.

41:53.219 --> 41:55.638
-Finish what you started.
-Or don't.

41:57.806 --> 41:58.807
Wow.

41:59.350 --> 42:00.184
Really?

42:01.519 --> 42:03.187
Calliope? Calliope?

42:03.270 --> 42:05.231
I told Dad Prague wasn't far enough.

42:05.314 --> 42:07.900
No place would keep me away
from these shenanigans.

42:07.983 --> 42:10.945
A silver box at the bottom of the ocean
would've kept you away.

42:12.029 --> 42:13.572
You don't have to live like this.

42:14.323 --> 42:16.700
-I'm proof.
-Of what?

42:16.784 --> 42:18.536
I got all the good genes.

42:18.619 --> 42:21.288
No, that's what you manipulated
everybody into believing.

42:22.206 --> 42:25.709
-That's why I'm taking Juliette away.
-Wake up, Calliope.

42:25.793 --> 42:28.754
Untie your friend, Jules.
I'll make sure Elinor behaves.

42:30.548 --> 42:32.299
My, what big teeth you have.

42:51.485 --> 42:53.362
-No. Run.
-What?

42:54.029 --> 42:56.991
Hit the sound blast. Move.

42:59.034 --> 42:59.868
Set.

43:03.414 --> 43:05.124
-Run. Now.
-No!

43:25.811 --> 43:29.773
<i>Some decisions you have to</i>
<i>mull over, consider, contemplate.</i>

43:30.899 --> 43:36.196
<i>But sometimes, you know</i>
<i>inyourgutthe right thing to do.</i>

43:36.280 --> 43:37.114
Juliette.
