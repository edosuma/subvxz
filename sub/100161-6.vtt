04:10.261 --> 04:12.198
what did you do
to make it better?

04:19.437 --> 04:20.870
What happened, sweetheart?

04:21.810 --> 04:23.472
I slept with Adam.

04:24.698 --> 04:26.893
I slept with Adam,
and then I told Smitty,

04:26.977 --> 04:31.636
and then Smitty attacked him
with a bat and broke his arm

04:31.952 --> 04:33.464
and... got arrested.

04:33.569 --> 04:36.518
‐ Where is he?
‐ I posted his bail, but...

04:36.690 --> 04:40.866
the charges... can you...
talk to Adam about that?

04:40.949 --> 04:42.242
Talk to him?

04:42.489 --> 04:43.905
Get him to drop the charges?

04:47.373 --> 04:48.413
Sweetheart,

04:48.546 --> 04:51.293
I think that's somethin'
you gotta do.

Ha ha.
Um...

05:05.381 --> 05:06.940

‐ He's in with Bridget.

05:13.436 --> 05:15.192
‐ Bridget's here?
‐ Yeah.

05:15.280 --> 05:16.366
Okay. Ha.

05:16.454 --> 05:19.098
I lived a few blocks
from you when we were kids.

05:19.249 --> 05:21.281
‐ Molly Sullivan!
‐ That's right.

05:21.364 --> 05:22.741
Wow, uh...

05:22.824 --> 05:24.272
Ray.

05:27.344 --> 05:29.708
‐ I really need to talk to ya.
‐ All right.

05:29.850 --> 05:31.679
'Scuse me.

05:33.678 --> 05:35.202
Sorry.

05:35.420 --> 05:37.022
Shouldn't take long.

05:47.867 --> 05:49.036
What's goin' on,
Bunch?

05:49.194 --> 05:50.463
The kid I shot.

05:56.678 --> 05:58.303
If I were you...

05:58.668 --> 06:02.397
I, uh, I wouldn't touch
our family with a ten‐foot pole.

06:03.565 --> 06:04.900
Thanks.

06:08.220 --> 06:09.653
‐ I stole it.
‐ From where?

06:09.741 --> 06:11.164
‐ It doesn't matter.
‐ Are you outta

06:11.248 --> 06:13.708
‐ your fuckin' mind, Bunch?
‐ I shot the kid.

06:13.796 --> 06:16.185
Because he was tryin'
to rob your store!

06:16.923 --> 06:19.003
You said
that I had stepped up,

06:19.091 --> 06:21.081
that I did
what I had to do.

06:21.169 --> 06:22.384
But I didn't.

06:22.568 --> 06:25.287
I'm just tryin' to do
the right fuckin' thing.

06:25.466 --> 06:27.019
Why didn't you just come
talk to me?

06:27.114 --> 06:28.864
I mean, for fuck's sake,
if you need money,

06:28.974 --> 06:30.808
‐ you can come work for me.
‐ Really?

06:30.896 --> 06:32.443
Yeah.

06:47.325 --> 06:50.065
‐ I'm sorry about that.
‐ No need to apologize.

06:50.153 --> 06:51.245
I should go.

06:51.333 --> 06:53.373
All right.
I'll call you a car.

06:58.878 --> 07:01.427
You know, my place
is a lot less crowded.

07:15.130 --> 07:17.130
Your daughter's
a lot like you.

07:18.623 --> 07:20.341
‐ Yeah?
‐ Yeah.

07:20.447 --> 07:22.940
Smart, tough,

07:23.435 --> 07:24.732
angry.

07:24.904 --> 07:26.224
Honest.

07:29.703 --> 07:30.998
Is she okay?

07:31.582 --> 07:33.230
She's only been married
four months

07:33.318 --> 07:34.888
and she's already
having an affair.

07:37.800 --> 07:39.998
And... what about
your brother?

07:40.957 --> 07:43.021
He's all bent outta shape

07:43.412 --> 07:44.411
'cause he shot some kid

07:44.499 --> 07:46.418
who was robbin'
the store he works in.

07:49.005 --> 07:51.326
And you're the one
in therapy.

07:55.106 --> 07:56.756
Yeah.

08:03.700 --> 08:05.833
I‐I thought you went
back to Boston.

08:06.467 --> 08:07.959
Somethin' came up.

08:08.672 --> 08:11.049
Well,
don't you have a hotel?

08:11.864 --> 08:13.843
Happy to see you, too,
Moll.

08:16.462 --> 08:18.029
Who wants a drink?

08:22.640 --> 08:24.498
How's the family, Ray?

08:25.553 --> 08:26.587
All right.

08:26.675 --> 08:27.881
Yeah?

08:29.357 --> 08:31.346
Musta been a hard year.

08:31.654 --> 08:33.181
All that loss.

08:33.576 --> 08:35.128
Yeah.

08:35.469 --> 08:37.638
Have a seat.
Sit down.

08:38.318 --> 08:39.479
Go on.

08:40.644 --> 08:42.184
You don't wanna sit
with an old man?

08:42.273 --> 08:44.105
‐ Dad, he wants to go.
‐ It's all right.

08:50.586 --> 08:51.902
Thanks.

09:02.840 --> 09:05.543
So Mick went out
in a ball of flame, huh?

09:08.530 --> 09:10.066
How was the funeral?

09:14.863 --> 09:17.304
We had a little wake
at the apartment.

09:18.237 --> 09:19.484
No body?

09:22.503 --> 09:24.371
Somebody killed
Billy Doyle.

09:24.886 --> 09:26.276
Outside‐a Boston.

09:26.910 --> 09:28.605
You... Did ya know him?

09:29.472 --> 09:31.933
But you knew
Larry O'Malley.

09:33.183 --> 09:34.242
The cop?

09:34.464 --> 09:37.503
Yeah.
They got to him too.

09:39.207 --> 09:41.152
Fuckin' electrocuted him.

09:42.067 --> 09:44.067
So here's the thing.

09:44.925 --> 09:48.089
Me, O'Malley, and Doyle,
we did this job, uh,

09:48.207 --> 09:50.133
back in '77.

09:50.707 --> 09:53.027
You know who else
was on that job?

09:53.652 --> 09:55.027
Your father.

09:56.472 --> 09:58.349
Both‐a those guys get killed

09:58.566 --> 10:00.977
right after Mick supposedly
gets his ass blown up

10:01.061 --> 10:02.488
on a fuckin' bus.

10:03.097 --> 10:05.464
I would feel
a whole lot better

10:05.897 --> 10:07.830
if there was a body, Ray.

10:08.424 --> 10:12.416
And then I got
17 missed calls

10:12.596 --> 10:15.885
from O'Malley's
little runt of a kid, Ronny.

10:16.002 --> 10:17.930
He thinks I'm killin'
these people.

10:18.018 --> 10:21.369
It would be fine if...
if I was, but I'm not.

10:22.136 --> 10:24.994
He thinks I'm trying to get
his old man's tapes.

10:25.510 --> 10:26.752
What tapes?

10:26.885 --> 10:29.461
O'Malley was my inside guy

10:29.549 --> 10:30.968
for years.

10:32.127 --> 10:33.401
Frickin'...

10:34.094 --> 10:39.088
wired his office like he was
Richard fuckin' Nixon.

10:40.065 --> 10:41.518
He and his boys...

10:41.776 --> 10:44.736
they are skids,
that whole family.

10:46.580 --> 10:49.127
They been holdin' those tapes
over my head

10:49.791 --> 10:51.768
ever since he left the force.

10:52.291 --> 10:54.953
Thirty years payin' for
their trips to Cancun,

10:55.041 --> 10:56.822
their wives' fake tits.

10:57.380 --> 10:59.010
You be me, Ray.

11:00.408 --> 11:02.330
Who's bumpin' these guys off?

11:12.971 --> 11:14.432
Thanks for the drink.

11:29.400 --> 11:31.518
What the fuck is going on?

11:32.110 --> 11:33.932
You know,
I've always liked Ray.

11:34.445 --> 11:35.807
He's a good worker.

11:37.198 --> 11:39.400
Creative with violence.

11:49.565 --> 11:50.908
See that address?

11:51.197 --> 11:52.432
Four‐oh‐four.

11:52.560 --> 11:54.072
Five six.

11:54.455 --> 11:56.501
Those numbers
mean anything to you?

11:57.314 --> 11:59.229
- Not me.
- No.

11:59.377 --> 12:00.705
Why, should it?

12:00.979 --> 12:03.391
I guess I'm just lookin'
for a sign...

12:04.361 --> 12:05.852
things are gonna be right.

12:06.150 --> 12:07.807
Pop, let me do this one.

12:08.525 --> 12:09.736
What?

12:10.102 --> 12:11.565
Yeah,
let me do this one.

12:12.442 --> 12:13.744
What for?

12:14.321 --> 12:16.291
'Cause I don't want
any more people killed.

12:18.989 --> 12:20.635
Stay in the car.

12:24.636 --> 12:25.869
I'll be right back.

13:25.692 --> 13:26.902
Hey, Ray.

13:28.596 --> 13:29.707
What's goin' on?

13:32.480 --> 13:34.916
‐ What do ya mean?
‐ What are you doin' here?

13:35.471 --> 13:38.133
What... You said

13:38.221 --> 13:40.408
‐ What?
‐ Last night you said

13:40.588 --> 13:41.625
I could come work for ya.

13:41.713 --> 13:43.908
Yeah, I‐I know what I said,
I‐I...

13:44.447 --> 13:46.196
I just didn't know
you meant today.

13:46.284 --> 13:48.133
‐ You forgot.
‐ No, I didn't fuckin' for...

13:48.221 --> 13:49.831
Where's Smitty?

13:49.973 --> 13:51.650

13:52.173 --> 13:53.738
I put on a suit
and everything.

13:53.826 --> 13:56.314
‐ Where'd you get that?
‐ What do you mean?

14:02.760 --> 14:04.770
Come on.
I gotta get outta here.

14:05.898 --> 14:07.483
All right.

14:16.713 --> 14:19.110
‐ You look good.
‐ Yeah?

14:20.260 --> 14:21.596
Nice suit.

14:25.752 --> 14:28.510
I really appreciate ya
givin' me this job.

14:32.119 --> 14:33.207
You know, I was thinkin',

14:33.291 --> 14:35.619
I don't know, uh,
how you do

14:35.744 --> 14:38.080
payroll or whatever,
but...

14:39.111 --> 14:41.716
you... you think I might
get an advance?

14:41.885 --> 14:43.384
What for?

14:43.647 --> 14:45.087
That kid's surgery.

14:49.109 --> 14:50.486
Sure, Bunch.

14:52.602 --> 14:54.056
Thank you.

14:58.817 --> 15:00.777
I‐I'll work it off
super fast.

15:06.939 --> 15:08.517
So what are we doin'?

15:09.043 --> 15:10.806
I'm gonna drop ya off
at JFK.

15:10.894 --> 15:13.549
I want ya to talk to a woman
named Patty at Lufthansa.

15:14.368 --> 15:16.736
Okay.
Why?

15:18.784 --> 15:21.025
I wanna make sure
Mick got on that plane.

15:40.189 --> 15:41.275
They're all dated.

15:41.359 --> 15:43.152
They're all dated nice
and neat.

15:43.236 --> 15:44.320
Ha ha.

15:47.014 --> 15:49.183
You're awfully
quiet back there.

15:53.480 --> 15:56.580
Daryll, it's not
your fault he pulled a gun.

15:58.017 --> 15:59.853
Put it behind you, Daryll.

16:00.060 --> 16:03.197
It's the past.
You done... you done your best.

16:03.431 --> 16:04.799
Don't worry.

16:04.882 --> 16:06.551
Don't worry.

16:06.634 --> 16:09.064
Things are gonna go good.
You'll see.

16:11.330 --> 16:13.641
We got the goods.
We got the goods here.

16:15.484 --> 16:16.783
Yeah.

16:55.951 --> 16:57.369
Hello?

Yeah.

18:19.438 --> 18:20.979
Ronny's dead.

18:21.847 --> 18:23.266
Jesus.

18:23.354 --> 18:24.605
Fuck.

18:24.721 --> 18:26.691
Whoever killed him
cracked his safe.

18:26.971 --> 18:29.143
<i>Looks like they got
what they were lookin' for.</i>

18:29.346 --> 18:30.987
<i>Anything you wanna tell me?</i>

18:31.229 --> 18:33.487
I didn't do this, Ray.
Hand to God.

18:33.643 --> 18:35.369
<i>This wasn't me.</i>

18:36.091 --> 18:38.828
<i>I sent one of my guys over
to O'Malley's nursing home.</i>

18:38.916 --> 18:40.413
<i>Last thing anybody knew,</i>

18:40.565 --> 18:42.206
Larry went swimming.

18:42.705 --> 18:44.625
A black guy signed him out.

18:44.815 --> 18:47.295
‐ What's the name?
‐ J. White.

18:47.494 --> 18:50.205
<i>Common fuckin' name.
Could be J‐Jeffrey, J...</i>

19:08.838 --> 19:09.960
Fuck you.

19:10.401 --> 19:13.117
I'll... You know what,
I'll fuck your eye sockets

19:13.205 --> 19:15.297
till that senile brain
drips out...

19:15.385 --> 19:18.080
Your motherfuckin' ears.

19:23.705 --> 19:24.749
Yeah, Dad.

19:24.832 --> 19:26.336
I need ya to come back
to New York,

19:26.424 --> 19:27.445
do somethin' for me.

19:27.533 --> 19:29.979
Why don't ya get Kevin?
He can ruin his manicure.

19:30.132 --> 19:31.815
<i>I don't need Kevin.</i>

19:32.041 --> 19:33.682
Well, what do I get
out of it?

19:36.237 --> 19:38.237
We'll talk about that
when you get here.

19:51.205 --> 19:52.580
<i>Yeah?</i>

19:53.276 --> 19:54.424
Hey, it's...

19:54.862 --> 19:56.776
it's Smitty, um...

19:57.448 --> 19:58.717
Can I come in?

19:58.812 --> 20:00.924
<i>Door's fuckin' open.</i>

20:07.947 --> 20:10.544
What do you got, like a sun
allergy or somethin'?

20:10.628 --> 20:12.182
What do ya need?

20:19.428 --> 20:21.197
I got arrested last night.

20:22.845 --> 20:23.877
So?

20:24.041 --> 20:25.976
I never been arrested before.

20:26.330 --> 20:27.687
What did you do?

20:28.433 --> 20:29.588
Ugh...

20:29.715 --> 20:31.479
I beat some guy up

20:32.186 --> 20:33.838
with a baseball bat.

20:34.686 --> 20:35.932
Why?

20:38.364 --> 20:40.041
He had sex with Bridget.

20:41.158 --> 20:42.697
Ah, Jesus.

20:43.651 --> 20:45.196
What do I do, Terry?

20:45.287 --> 20:47.540
I thought that, you know,
she loved me.

20:47.628 --> 20:50.589
Di... didn't you think
that she loved me?

20:51.768 --> 20:52.936
Sh...

20:55.299 --> 20:57.447
Where's... where's my phone?

21:02.276 --> 21:04.518
I didn't think she'd cheat.

21:05.943 --> 21:08.181
Everybody cheats.

21:09.372 --> 21:10.472
What?

21:10.560 --> 21:12.388
I don't think
Mick got on that plane.

21:12.523 --> 21:14.103
‐ What?
‐ I'm guessin' he's up to

21:14.191 --> 21:15.482
somethin' with Daryll.

21:16.193 --> 21:18.411
Can you get to Sandy's
and see if anyone's there?

21:18.499 --> 21:21.417
Yeah. Uh, S‐Smitty's here.
He can drive me.

21:21.550 --> 21:23.138
The fuck's he doin' there?

21:23.316 --> 21:25.294
He's all bent outta shape
over Bridget.

21:25.382 --> 21:26.888
Jesus Christ.

21:29.231 --> 21:31.176
Ah... all right,
big poppy.

21:31.365 --> 21:34.005
- You're drivin'.
- So you think that you're...

21:40.122 --> 21:41.802
<i>Yo, yo!
This is Double D,</i>

21:42.028 --> 21:43.721
<i>Daryll Donovan,
Mr. lucky producer,</i>

21:43.804 --> 21:45.372
‐ Oh, fu...
<i>‐ Busy motherfuck...</i>

21:50.407 --> 21:52.292
You know, when I first
met Bridget, I was...

21:52.380 --> 21:53.505
I was dying.

21:53.593 --> 21:56.052
I wasn't really in the‐the
head space to think about,

21:56.357 --> 21:57.568
you know,
what she needed or...

21:57.651 --> 22:01.646
Yeah, well, it w... it... it was
a rough time for her too.

22:02.068 --> 22:03.474
So what do I do?

22:04.575 --> 22:06.869
I mean, am I... am I supposed
to do somethin'?

22:06.952 --> 22:08.537
Well, you beat up
the guy.

22:08.621 --> 22:09.974
Ya got arrested.

22:10.989 --> 22:12.566
That's a good way‐a
showin' someone

22:12.654 --> 22:13.785
ya love 'em.

22:15.185 --> 22:17.296
So now I just go back
and...

22:17.817 --> 22:19.193
just forgive her?

22:19.816 --> 22:21.683
That depends.
Does she wanna be forgiven?

22:21.771 --> 22:23.513
Well, she hasn't apologized.

22:24.716 --> 22:26.300
Look, I‐I don't know shit

22:26.388 --> 22:28.222
about women or love,
bu‐but I do know

22:28.310 --> 22:29.940
that you can't
give a woman somethin'

22:30.028 --> 22:32.099
they just didn't fuckin'
ask for in the first place.

22:48.458 --> 22:49.745
Here you are, Sandy.

22:49.864 --> 22:51.455
Aw, thanks.

22:51.700 --> 22:53.011
Fuck!

22:53.437 --> 22:55.148
Yo, Ray keeps callin' me.

22:56.072 --> 22:57.532
Turn your phone off.

23:00.923 --> 23:02.007
Fuck, Ray!

23:02.095 --> 23:02.909
Ahh...

23:03.147 --> 23:04.838
No, Sandy, not while
it's ringin'!

23:04.926 --> 23:06.381
He's gonna know
I sent him to voicemail.

23:06.468 --> 23:08.586
I hate fuckin' cell phones!

23:08.968 --> 23:11.559
I miss... phone booths.

23:11.679 --> 23:15.312
Nobody ever got eaten out
inside a cell phone.

23:19.851 --> 23:22.211
The shit on this tape
is unbelievable.

23:23.054 --> 23:26.000
Jimmy Sullivan'll give us
anything we want.

23:26.593 --> 23:28.482
Your future
is secure, Daryll.

23:28.570 --> 23:29.982
Yeah, how many
dead bodies later?

23:30.070 --> 23:31.912
Stop dwellin' on that.

23:32.179 --> 23:33.875
Wasn't your fault.

23:34.498 --> 23:36.054
Look, I told ya,

23:36.578 --> 23:38.115
big guy upstairs
is lookin' out for us.

23:38.203 --> 23:40.921
There is no big guy upstairs,
okay?

23:41.005 --> 23:44.091
There is no fate
guiding our fucking steps.

23:44.174 --> 23:47.109
All I see is us fucking up.

23:47.515 --> 23:48.741
I'm sorry, Pop,

23:48.829 --> 23:51.086
but I don't see what you see.

23:54.801 --> 23:56.226
Well, you can't see love
either.

23:56.314 --> 23:58.875
- Oh, Jesus.
- But it exists.

24:00.179 --> 24:01.625
I made a promise

24:01.937 --> 24:04.695
to your mother, Daryll,
when you were a baby.

24:04.929 --> 24:07.093
And I just wanna keep my word.

24:08.624 --> 24:11.422
Remember when you came
to visit me at Walpole?

24:12.258 --> 24:13.662
You ran away from home,

24:13.750 --> 24:15.672
took the Greyhound
cross‐country.

24:15.828 --> 24:17.416
You remember that,
huh?

24:17.499 --> 24:19.209
Yeah, I remember.

24:19.554 --> 24:21.545
Yeah, two decades in lockup,

24:21.629 --> 24:23.015
and that was...

24:23.351 --> 24:25.515
that was the one greatest day.

24:25.968 --> 24:27.009
Yeah.

24:30.327 --> 24:33.327
The money from that heist
shoulda gone to you kids.

24:36.286 --> 24:38.672
And now I'm gonna
get it for ya.

24:52.852 --> 24:54.117
Sandy!

25:21.453 --> 25:23.427
And this is where
we had our wedding night.

25:23.515 --> 25:26.068
Jesus Christ.
Stop fuckin' moanin'.

25:26.151 --> 25:27.861
Just go and check

25:27.945 --> 25:29.655
if the car's out back.

26:03.984 --> 26:05.441
Smitty!

26:05.742 --> 26:07.401
What are ya doin'?

26:07.484 --> 26:09.365
Check the garage,
ya dumb fuck!

26:09.460 --> 26:11.812
Yeah, I I...
I got it.

26:40.179 --> 26:41.555
<i>You are
sixty days behind</i>

26:41.643 --> 26:42.910
<i>on your water and sewer bill.</i>

26:42.998 --> 26:44.792
Hey there's no car out there.

26:45.207 --> 26:47.043
<i>Hi, yeah, this is Chad
here at Dusty Bottoms</i>

26:47.149 --> 26:48.994
<i>in Rose Beach
just calling to say</i>

26:49.082 --> 26:50.387
<i>you left your
credit card here.</i>

26:50.621 --> 26:54.121
<i>You, um, gave me your number
so, uh, yeah,</i>

26:54.209 --> 26:55.691
<i>your card's here.</i>

27:05.996 --> 27:07.221
Yeah.

27:07.309 --> 27:09.191
<i>Mick never
got on the plane.</i>

27:12.388 --> 27:13.681
Thanks, Bunch.

27:14.316 --> 27:15.816
<i>What should I do now?</i>

27:16.473 --> 27:17.971
I'll call you
when I need you.

27:50.523 --> 27:51.951
You got a warrant?

27:52.875 --> 27:54.621
‐ What?
‐ Officer, please provide me

27:54.709 --> 27:56.107
with your badge number
and warrant.

27:56.599 --> 27:58.043
I'm not a cop.

27:58.287 --> 28:00.988
Let it be shown the officer
refuses to provide a warrant.

28:01.076 --> 28:02.724
My brother
lives here.

28:03.048 --> 28:04.357
Your brother?

28:05.534 --> 28:06.935
Daryll Donovan.

28:07.498 --> 28:08.951
You ever met Daryll?

28:09.297 --> 28:11.925
‐ Half‐brother.
‐ I'm calling the cops.

28:12.091 --> 28:14.232
If he comes back,
tell him I'm lookin' for him.

28:25.224 --> 28:26.316
Yeah, Ter.

28:26.404 --> 28:28.537
I found her.
Rose Beach.

28:28.638 --> 28:30.961
<i>Someplace called
Dusty Bottoms.</i>

28:31.091 --> 28:32.990
Sandy left her
credit card there.

28:33.505 --> 28:35.656
Fuckin' idiot.

28:46.076 --> 28:47.670
Hey.

28:48.107 --> 28:50.951
I'm so sorry
about what happened.

28:51.888 --> 28:53.233
He busted up my car.

28:53.317 --> 28:55.326
Ugh. You have insurance,
right?

28:55.414 --> 28:56.989
How easy do you think
it is for me to replace

28:57.076 --> 28:58.269
my Tom Murphy Les Paul?

28:58.357 --> 29:00.115
And I can't
fuckin' play.

29:01.663 --> 29:03.746
I'm sorry you got
your arm broken.

29:03.834 --> 29:06.880
"I got my arm broken"?
Like I fell off a swing?

29:07.763 --> 29:09.082
You knew I was married.

29:09.166 --> 29:10.765
You knew that there
could be consequences.

29:10.853 --> 29:12.920
Not getting hit with
a fuckin' bat consequences.

29:13.003 --> 29:15.213
I had to cancel
three months of dates.

29:16.506 --> 29:18.519
I need you to drop
the charges against Smitty.

29:18.607 --> 29:20.521
Well, that is not
a fair thing to ask.

29:22.343 --> 29:23.599
Adam...

29:24.584 --> 29:26.324
is the story
that you want out there

29:26.412 --> 29:28.503
that you slept with your
married 21‐year‐old intern

29:28.591 --> 29:30.841
and then her husband
beat the shit out of you?

29:31.787 --> 29:33.941
It's not a very
rock 'n' roll reason

29:34.029 --> 29:35.734
to cancel a tour.

29:37.200 --> 29:38.302
You could say

29:38.390 --> 29:41.253
you broke your arm...
trashing your own equipment

29:41.341 --> 29:43.408
during a... a hot session.

29:46.051 --> 29:48.099
I mean, that's kinda
early Who bad‐ass.

29:50.193 --> 29:51.599
I like you.

29:52.227 --> 29:55.451
I really do,
and I‐I‐I love your talent.

29:56.248 --> 29:57.800
Even when you plagiarize.

30:03.404 --> 30:04.959
I'll drop the charges.

30:06.287 --> 30:08.066
‐ You will?
‐ Yeah, I'll tell the cops

30:08.154 --> 30:09.216
it never happened.

30:11.326 --> 30:12.729
Thank you.

30:46.677 --> 30:47.677
Yo.

30:48.383 --> 30:50.005
I need you to meet me.

30:50.200 --> 30:51.708
<i>Why?</i>

30:51.891 --> 30:53.434
I need a car.

30:53.848 --> 30:55.981
Ray Donovan's
workin' for you?

30:56.481 --> 30:58.473
Ray did this
on his own.

30:59.294 --> 31:01.302
He's got a thing for Molly.

31:02.263 --> 31:04.003
He says the tapes are gone.

31:04.091 --> 31:05.229
And you believe him.

31:05.317 --> 31:06.591
I dunno.

31:06.679 --> 31:10.184
He's playin' you.
Don't fuckin' delude yourself.

31:11.506 --> 31:15.231
Okay, when I bring you
the tapes, what do I get?

31:15.544 --> 31:17.622
You get to save
your own fuckin' skin.

31:17.864 --> 31:19.379
We could lose
everything we got.

31:19.463 --> 31:20.714
Kevin's job.

31:21.466 --> 31:23.378
‐ What?
‐ I want Kevin's job.

31:23.473 --> 31:25.738
I wanna... run the company.

31:26.059 --> 31:27.075
No.

31:27.248 --> 31:30.411
Why? 'Cause I didn't
go to college?

31:31.659 --> 31:33.912
I don't see your
fuckin' diploma on the wall.

31:34.144 --> 31:35.614
We go public,

31:37.802 --> 31:41.114
you think the stockholders
are gonna be able to trust you,

31:41.864 --> 31:43.520
guy with your history?

31:51.835 --> 31:53.973
You're on your own then,
Pop.

31:55.926 --> 31:58.630
Let me know
how it all works out for ya.

32:52.548 --> 32:54.165
Fuck!

33:16.617 --> 33:18.202
You gonna answer that?

33:18.622 --> 33:19.915
No.

33:22.172 --> 33:24.032
Talk to your wife.

33:28.998 --> 33:29.998
Hello?

33:30.211 --> 33:32.618
‐ Hi.
<i>‐ Hi.</i>

33:33.300 --> 33:35.102
Adam's gonna drop
the charges.

33:35.955 --> 33:36.998
Why?

33:37.180 --> 33:40.187
<i>So you won't have to
go to jail or get fined.</i>

33:40.477 --> 33:42.731
He's not even gonna
charge us for the damages.

33:42.814 --> 33:45.092
‐ "Us"?
<i>‐ Yeah, I'm your wife, so...</i>

33:45.180 --> 33:49.047
No, no, no, no, y‐y‐you
don't get to say "us" anymore.

33:49.175 --> 33:50.897
Smitty, p‐please...

33:50.985 --> 33:52.180
<i>No... I‐I...</i>

33:52.268 --> 33:53.618
I want those charges back,
okay?

33:53.706 --> 33:55.326
You have no right
to undo

33:55.414 --> 33:57.774
any of the things
that I do, okay?

34:05.769 --> 34:07.422
Did you hang up
on her?

34:08.304 --> 34:09.422
Yep.

34:10.196 --> 34:11.976
Where's your fuckin'
manners?

34:14.047 --> 34:15.657
You know she cheated on me.

34:15.745 --> 34:17.456
You ain't leavin' her,
she ain't leavin' you.

34:17.543 --> 34:19.460
‐ Oh, you don't know that.
‐ Yeah?

34:20.956 --> 34:24.184
K‐kid, you married her forever
when you killed that cop.

34:24.594 --> 34:26.107
What's that supposed to mean?

34:26.190 --> 34:28.804
We got bodies
buried in the backyard.

34:29.614 --> 34:31.243
You joined the family then.

34:32.719 --> 34:35.367
I don't think you're leavin'
anytime soon.

34:53.176 --> 34:54.594
What are we gonna do?

34:54.678 --> 34:56.054
Where's Ray keep his
registration?

34:56.137 --> 34:57.597
Don't open the fuckin'
glove box

34:57.681 --> 34:59.157
in front of
the fuckin' police.

34:59.245 --> 35:00.581
Take it easy.

35:05.667 --> 35:07.628
I‐I‐is there a problem,
Officer?

35:07.737 --> 35:09.359
Get out.

35:10.318 --> 35:12.368
What, am... am I in
some sort of trouble?

35:12.456 --> 35:14.019
‐ Get out of the car.
‐

35:16.456 --> 35:20.206
Turn around, put your hands
behind your back, Mr. Smith.

35:26.764 --> 35:28.557
Hey... Ow!

35:34.158 --> 35:35.558
Watch your head.

36:33.904 --> 36:37.215
Hey, Tab Hunter.
Yeah, you, boo thang in a suit.

36:37.350 --> 36:38.967
Come here.
Let me lay one on you.

36:39.139 --> 36:40.475
They're only temporary.

36:40.673 --> 36:43.561
Not like what you're doing
to my heart right now, Hunty.

36:44.467 --> 36:46.998
You know where I could
find Dusty Bottoms?

36:48.056 --> 36:50.141
One block down, take a right,
you can't miss it.

36:50.235 --> 36:51.795
Well, come back
if you change your mind?

37:07.986 --> 37:09.900
<i>Ride 'Em Night starts
in about an hour, folks.</i>

37:09.988 --> 37:13.645
<i>Who wants to ride
Mr. Angus McBangus over there?</i>

37:13.733 --> 37:17.260
<i>Sign up with me,
Hedda Lettuce, at the DJ booth.</i>

37:18.361 --> 37:19.385
Hey!

37:19.649 --> 37:22.471
Keep it movin', boys.
Keep it movin'!

37:29.415 --> 37:30.820
What can I get
for you, sweetie?

37:30.908 --> 37:32.408
I'm here to pick up
a credit card.

37:33.294 --> 37:35.400
Sandy... Patrick?

37:35.488 --> 37:37.156
‐ Yeah.
‐ And you are?

37:37.543 --> 37:39.045
Her son.

37:39.144 --> 37:40.270
‐ She's your mother?
‐ Yeah.

37:40.358 --> 37:42.478
What was it like
growing up with her?

37:43.014 --> 37:45.197
I'll take a Johnnie Walker
Black, neat, please.

37:45.285 --> 37:48.204
I get it.
Save it for your therapist.

37:48.791 --> 37:50.066
Wanna start a tab?

37:52.766 --> 37:53.855
Yeah.

38:35.011 --> 38:36.377
Uh, excuse me.

38:39.459 --> 38:41.612
There was a boy
in that room.

38:42.085 --> 38:44.755
You know, he had his
mother there all the time...

38:44.843 --> 38:46.510
Mateo Santiago?

38:47.206 --> 38:48.721
Are you a family member?

38:49.782 --> 38:50.987
Friend of the family.

38:51.285 --> 38:52.918
Let me get someone else
to speak with you.

38:53.005 --> 38:55.018
‐ Just a moment.
‐ Well, why can't you

38:55.106 --> 38:56.284
speak with me?

38:56.454 --> 38:58.641
Why?
Where'd ya move him to?

38:58.729 --> 39:00.397
Hey, Brendan.

39:01.209 --> 39:02.350
Oh, guess you heard.

39:02.563 --> 39:04.891
‐ Heard what?
‐ The punk you shot.

39:05.280 --> 39:06.462
He didn't make it.

39:07.241 --> 39:08.727
He had an infection.

39:08.907 --> 39:10.438
Went right like that.

39:10.991 --> 39:12.548
Survival
of the fittest, huh?

39:29.747 --> 39:31.138
Want a stick?

39:32.873 --> 39:34.076
Suit yourself.

39:46.572 --> 39:48.860
Your wife's dead
grandfather...

39:49.388 --> 39:52.849
he capable of killing
three cops all by himself?

39:53.043 --> 39:54.165
Mickey?

39:54.399 --> 39:58.282
Ugh... oh, he...

39:59.360 --> 40:00.946
he was a bad guy.

40:01.129 --> 40:02.478
But three?

40:02.566 --> 40:04.318
In one night?

40:04.406 --> 40:07.923
And cut 'em up in pieces
and drop them in the Sound?

40:08.594 --> 40:10.321
He was really scary.

40:10.946 --> 40:12.478
He terrified me.

40:14.403 --> 40:16.623
Why do you think Mickey
would kill three cops

40:16.711 --> 40:18.022
he didn't know?

40:20.121 --> 40:22.272
‐ You'd have to ask him.
‐ Mm.

40:26.085 --> 40:29.092
Your father‐in‐law... Ray.

40:30.756 --> 40:32.483
‐ Mm‐hmm.
‐ Does he know

40:32.571 --> 40:35.327
that he's putting you and your
wife into all sorts of trouble?

40:35.694 --> 40:37.997
‐ What do you mean?
‐ Did you know, Mr. Smith,

40:38.085 --> 40:39.764
that murdering three cops

40:39.852 --> 40:42.605
earns you three consecutive
life sentences?

40:43.194 --> 40:45.153
Did you know being
accessory to that crime

40:45.241 --> 40:46.827
carries the same sentence?

40:47.051 --> 40:49.069
Just like you
killed them yourself.

40:51.308 --> 40:52.522
On the night of November 7th,

40:52.610 --> 40:55.446
you were at the JWH show
at Madison Square Garden.

40:55.549 --> 40:57.272
‐ Yeah, that's right.
‐ Okay.

41:01.957 --> 41:04.042
<i>♪ That
thing, that thing I like ♪</i>

41:04.179 --> 41:06.432
<i>♪ That thing,
that thing you do ♪</i>

41:07.061 --> 41:08.063
<i>♪ That thing I like ♪</i>

41:08.151 --> 41:09.913
<i>♪ Now you got me
goin' craz... ♪</i>

41:10.840 --> 41:12.466
What's the next line?

41:12.574 --> 41:14.284
‐ Hmm?
‐ In the song.

41:14.372 --> 41:16.881
‐ The next line.
‐ I‐in that song?

41:16.969 --> 41:19.171
Come on... number one
on the charts for 18 weeks.

41:19.259 --> 41:21.969
I don't... I don't know
that... that song.

41:22.057 --> 41:24.264
I don't know, I mean...
I'm just not...

41:24.944 --> 41:27.419
You know, I‐I'm not really
like a lyrics guy.

41:27.507 --> 41:30.210
Girl, your body got me
saying ooh...

41:30.327 --> 41:32.983
Ooh... Oh, ooh.
Yeah, okay, that one.

41:36.408 --> 41:38.403
Why even give me
an alibi?

41:38.491 --> 41:40.842
‐ What?
‐ I wasn't even looking at you.

41:41.196 --> 41:43.585
And I wasn't even
looking at your wife.

41:44.034 --> 41:45.780
But then I started to.

41:46.608 --> 41:48.584
Your father‐in‐law
makes it his business

41:48.667 --> 41:50.085
to avoid consequences,

41:50.173 --> 41:53.426
but you, your wife...
you're easier to spot.

41:54.882 --> 41:56.216
What... Are you arresting me?

41:56.300 --> 41:58.551
Either you were lying
for your father‐in‐law,

41:58.639 --> 41:59.928
or he is lying for you.

42:00.116 --> 42:02.723
‐ Are you arresting me?
‐ We're just talking.

42:04.053 --> 42:07.311
But you need to start listening
to what I have to say.

42:22.326 --> 42:23.731
Whoo‐ee!
This cowpoke

42:23.819 --> 42:26.950
can come ride my bull
anytime!

42:27.038 --> 42:30.647
Hee‐haw!
Ha ha ha ha ha!

42:35.327 --> 42:37.233
- Mickey?
- Hey, baby.

42:37.335 --> 42:38.989
Gimme a hug!
So good to see you.

42:39.077 --> 42:40.969
- Good to see you.
- Muah, muah!

42:41.053 --> 42:42.216
‐ Muah!
‐ Take care of yourself.

42:42.303 --> 42:44.306
- All right, baby.
- All right...

42:44.389 --> 42:45.599
Take care‐a that bull.

42:45.682 --> 42:47.999
The man owes me $5.

42:48.171 --> 42:50.020
I'm here,

42:50.104 --> 42:53.124
I'm queer, and I'm Country!

43:52.243 --> 43:53.703
Oof!

43:55.836 --> 43:57.302
Ohh...

44:02.443 --> 44:03.912
What are you doin',
Daryll?

44:04.000 --> 44:05.724
You know, fuck you, Ray.

44:06.912 --> 44:08.084
What's goin' on?

44:09.552 --> 44:11.226
Y‐you know, Ray... Ray,

44:11.521 --> 44:12.644
you don't get it.

44:12.735 --> 44:15.162
What don't I get?

44:16.959 --> 44:18.400
Why you're following Mick
around

44:18.483 --> 44:20.216
like some fuckin'
trained monkey?

44:21.488 --> 44:23.282
What did you just say
to me?

44:25.149 --> 44:26.817
I called you
a fuckin' monkey.

44:27.669 --> 44:29.077
Oof!

44:29.223 --> 44:30.322
Okay.

44:30.410 --> 44:34.198
You wanna know
what I was doin', hmm?

44:34.286 --> 44:36.251
You wanna know what
I was doin' with Mick?

44:36.335 --> 44:37.502
Oof!

44:39.447 --> 44:41.333
Aah!

44:42.841 --> 44:44.009
Ohh...

44:46.220 --> 44:48.430
Ohh!

44:52.016 --> 44:54.852
‐ Motherfucker!
‐ Aah... uhh...

45:18.174 --> 45:20.009
When we first met...

45:21.797 --> 45:23.596
I saw it on your face.

45:24.268 --> 45:25.979
You was thinking,
"This nigger..."

45:28.791 --> 45:30.268
What?

45:31.055 --> 45:32.139
Yeah.

45:34.002 --> 45:36.104
So I want you
to say it to my face.

45:38.012 --> 45:39.346
Say what?

45:41.089 --> 45:42.925
You never thought of me
as a brother.

45:43.706 --> 45:45.566
Go fuck yourself,
Daryll.

45:49.173 --> 45:50.323
Uhh!
