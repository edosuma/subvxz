WEBVTT

00:18.935 --> 00:20.603
-Oh! Oh God!
-Oh my God. Um…

00:21.021 --> 00:22.731
I am so sorry.
Are you all right?

00:22.814 --> 00:23.898
No, no, no, no, it's fine.

00:23.982 --> 00:25.400
-Um…
-That was totally me.

00:36.077 --> 00:38.121
Don't you just love living in New York?

00:38.997 --> 00:40.457
Grocery shopping one minute.

00:41.249 --> 00:43.334
Hooking up with a hot guy the next.

00:43.418 --> 00:44.335
Totally.

00:50.258 --> 00:51.718
-Condoms?

00:52.969 --> 00:55.722
Are you kidding? Nobody wears condoms now.

00:56.306 --> 00:57.348
-What?
-Yeah.

00:58.850 --> 01:02.937
-Where have you been?
-A long-term relationship that just ended.

01:03.021 --> 01:06.483
The last time I had sex with a stranger,
I was gloved up and layered.

01:06.566 --> 01:07.984
My dick looked like Annie Hall.

01:08.568 --> 01:10.779
Who? Anyway, it's a new world now.

01:10.862 --> 01:14.532
There's PrEP.
There's post-exposure medications.

01:14.616 --> 01:18.453
We've given condoms and network TV
back to the straight people,

01:18.536 --> 01:19.621
where they belong.

01:20.330 --> 01:24.584
Right, but what about chlamydia,
and herpes, and warts,

01:24.667 --> 01:27.212
and all the other things I read about
waiting for my flu shot.

01:27.921 --> 01:30.298
You're a real glass-half-empty guy,
aren't you?

01:30.381 --> 01:32.133
Just chill, man.

01:32.217 --> 01:33.051
Relax.

01:33.885 --> 01:38.264
How? I have been careful for 17 years,
and you clearly do this all the time.

01:38.348 --> 01:39.682
-Mm.
-Picking up strangers,

01:39.766 --> 01:40.892
and fucking without condoms.

01:40.975 --> 01:43.144
So you can forget about barebacking.

01:43.228 --> 01:46.314
I can't get turned on when all I can see
is my name on that quilt.

01:46.397 --> 01:49.567
-What quilt?
-Oh my God, you millennials!

01:49.651 --> 01:53.071
Don't you know where we came from?
Where you got your freedoms?

01:53.154 --> 01:54.781
Don't you know what people like me…

01:54.864 --> 01:57.450
Well, not me, a little bit older.
But I've seen <i>Angels.</i>

01:57.534 --> 01:59.702
Don't you know what we sacrificed for you?

01:59.786 --> 02:01.371
You know what I do know, Gandalf?

02:01.871 --> 02:06.000
You may be hot,
but you're one bitter old queen.

02:13.633 --> 02:16.928
He called me a bitter old queen.
Can you believe that?

02:17.011 --> 02:20.181
Everyone looks old in a grocery store.
That overhead lighting.

02:20.265 --> 02:22.725
Pro tip. Wear a pink shirt
for some bounce.

02:22.809 --> 02:25.186
-I assume you met in the meat department.
-Ha ha.

02:25.854 --> 02:29.232
This is what I've become.
This is what Colin has done to me.

02:29.315 --> 02:30.733
Well, Colin and time.

02:30.817 --> 02:33.486
But come on, don't I have a right
to be a little bitter?

02:33.570 --> 02:37.198
Yeah. But you're angry at the whole world.
The whole world didn't dump you.

02:37.282 --> 02:40.910
If we could change the perennial subject,
I wanna show you guys something.

02:40.994 --> 02:43.746
Go ahead, swipe until you
get to the picture of my mother

02:43.830 --> 02:46.708
and her new cat, Wilhelm Munsch.

02:46.791 --> 02:49.085
The '70s gay illustrator from Berlin.

02:49.169 --> 02:52.046
It's my new show at the gallery.
I'm gonna put him on the map.

02:52.130 --> 02:54.591
Kind of looks
like old Tom of Finland stuff?

02:54.674 --> 02:56.676
Mustache. The leather cap.

02:56.759 --> 02:58.469
Oh! More graphic than Tom.

02:58.553 --> 03:01.764
This is what we do in the art world.
Re-contextualize.

03:01.848 --> 03:03.892
Before Warhol, soup cans
were just soup cans.

03:03.975 --> 03:06.269
The one on that guy
actually looks like a soup can.

03:06.352 --> 03:08.104
All my biggest buyers are coming.

03:08.188 --> 03:11.065
And Irwin Stossel is going to freak
when he sees this.

03:11.149 --> 03:14.360
His entire collection
is focused on gay art, and…

03:14.903 --> 03:16.362
you can't get gayer than this.

03:16.446 --> 03:18.489
And it's not just vintage stuff.

03:18.573 --> 03:20.366
These, he did last year.

03:20.950 --> 03:23.745
To stay modern. See what that guy's
doing with his iPhone?

03:23.828 --> 03:26.664
Isn't the human anatomy amazing?

03:27.248 --> 03:28.791
No condoms here either.

03:28.875 --> 03:31.127
-Has the whole world gone crazy?

03:31.628 --> 03:32.503
I'm s--

03:33.504 --> 03:34.505
It's my dad.

03:35.632 --> 03:37.967
I gotta get back to work anyway.
I'll see you guys later.

03:38.801 --> 03:40.178
Jesus, this day!

03:44.432 --> 03:48.061
-You wanna fix me up with who?
-Dr. Gibson. My dermatologist.

03:48.144 --> 03:51.105
I thought you were rooting
for Colin and me to get back together.

03:51.814 --> 03:53.524
Well, yeah, we were hoping, but--

03:54.359 --> 03:57.528
You know, even the greatest athlete
knows when it's time to leave the field.

03:57.612 --> 04:02.575
Well, I'm thrilled that you were able
to heal and move on, Dad, but I--

04:02.659 --> 04:04.577
You know what, never mind. I gotta go.

04:05.078 --> 04:06.746
I--

04:09.332 --> 04:10.667
Man, you're comin' in hot.

04:11.334 --> 04:14.212
My dad wants to fix me up.
Apparently, I'm supposed to be over this.

04:14.295 --> 04:18.299
That Ben. So sweet.
What do you think of this underwear?

04:20.385 --> 04:23.680
Do you really need
a pouch that big for your penis?

04:23.763 --> 04:26.683
They're for Kai.
He doesn't like to be confined.

04:26.766 --> 04:28.393
You buy underwear for your son?

04:28.476 --> 04:30.478
I just went over the Claire Lewis file.

04:30.561 --> 04:35.358
Why is the escrow 45 days? That pushes
our commission into the next quarter.

04:35.441 --> 04:36.693
We had to extend two weeks.

04:36.776 --> 04:39.696
Our buyers needed a little extra time
to finesse the co-op board.

04:39.779 --> 04:41.489
It's one of those trickier buildings.

04:41.572 --> 04:44.367
That sounds like a you problem,
not a Raffi problem.

04:44.450 --> 04:47.036
Are you kidding
with the Monday morning quarterbacking?

04:47.120 --> 04:48.788
We got the listing. We got the sale.

04:48.871 --> 04:51.791
I'm sorry if our huge commission
comes in two weeks too late

04:51.874 --> 04:53.209
to make you look like a star.

04:53.293 --> 04:54.377
Excuse me?

04:55.086 --> 04:57.630
Are we done?
Because Suzanne and I have work to do.

04:57.714 --> 04:59.590
Only if you're done, though.

04:59.674 --> 05:01.092
Oh, I'm done.

05:01.175 --> 05:04.012
If this doesn't close,
we'll have a different conversation.

05:04.095 --> 05:05.888
And you won't be the one yelling.

05:08.182 --> 05:09.767
Jesus, Michael!

05:10.310 --> 05:13.855
This isn't like you. You yelled at him
and used a sports metaphor?

05:13.938 --> 05:17.191
I know he clocked it too,
'cause a lot of his fur was standin' up.

05:17.275 --> 05:18.359
What is goin' on?

05:18.443 --> 05:20.069
Colin is what's going on.

05:20.153 --> 05:23.740
He just dumped me out
into this dating world I hate.

05:23.823 --> 05:26.951
So yes, I'm angry,
and it's not going away.

05:27.535 --> 05:28.661
Okay.

05:28.745 --> 05:31.706
This is crazy, but Mia…
You know my friend Mia.

05:31.789 --> 05:33.583
The one with the 3D temple veins?

05:33.666 --> 05:36.669
Not anymore.
She got rid of her rage with a healer.

05:36.753 --> 05:38.212
She's a different person now.

05:38.713 --> 05:41.549
Are you serious?
You want me to go see some guru?

05:41.632 --> 05:45.178
I'm gonna try it. You think you're
the only one with relationship issues?

05:45.261 --> 05:46.804
You? You're always dating.

05:46.888 --> 05:51.184
Eh, some of them are okay,
but nobody really gets me goin'. You know?

05:51.267 --> 05:55.730
It's like a pile of autumn leaves
down there. So, you free tonight?

06:07.367 --> 06:10.745
And now, present and awake,

06:11.412 --> 06:12.955
we turn to healing.

06:14.874 --> 06:18.920
Michael Lawson, please come forward.

06:19.003 --> 06:22.048
Seriously? Why do I have to go first?
Come with me.

06:22.131 --> 06:25.051
-No. Just try to be open. Go, go, go, go!
-I--

06:26.552 --> 06:27.428
Hi.

06:28.721 --> 06:29.555
Take a seat.

06:33.017 --> 06:36.813
And why have you sought my help, Michael?

06:37.897 --> 06:41.901
My boyfriend left me,
and I'm a little angry about it.

06:41.984 --> 06:43.820
Which, of course, is natural, right?

06:44.570 --> 06:47.073
Everything is natural.

06:48.699 --> 06:50.576
That's what natural means.

06:52.161 --> 06:54.664
Are you ready to go to the first level?

06:55.623 --> 06:56.457
Yes?

06:57.667 --> 06:59.502
What's happening?

07:00.586 --> 07:01.421
That's one.

07:03.464 --> 07:04.715
I don't feel any different.

07:05.299 --> 07:06.551
We have only begun.

07:08.052 --> 07:10.471
The journey takes time.

07:10.555 --> 07:12.682
Oh, the journey takes time.

07:12.765 --> 07:15.184
And I'm guessing
you have to buy a package.

07:15.685 --> 07:17.228
Are you ready to go to level two?

07:17.728 --> 07:18.688
Uh, okay.

07:22.150 --> 07:23.109
That's two.

07:24.652 --> 07:26.529
That's three. That's four.

07:26.612 --> 07:27.447
Seven.

07:29.574 --> 07:31.409
-That's…
-That's 12…

07:32.535 --> 07:34.495
…13, 14, 15.

07:38.875 --> 07:40.543
-That's 16.
-Okay.

07:42.295 --> 07:43.754
All right.

07:44.589 --> 07:46.340
There you go.

07:47.675 --> 07:49.135
That's it? I'm done?

07:49.927 --> 07:51.637
Do you think you're done?

07:51.721 --> 07:56.225
Well, I fell asleep around level ten,

07:56.309 --> 07:57.894
but yeah, sure, I'm done.

07:58.811 --> 07:59.687
Thanks.

07:59.770 --> 08:00.605
It was

08:01.397 --> 08:02.231
okay.

08:02.857 --> 08:04.775
Oh! Don't forget your T-shirt.

08:06.027 --> 08:06.903
Now do me!

08:08.863 --> 08:09.697
I'm next.

08:10.615 --> 08:12.909
Four hundred dollars.
That's a cut and color.

08:12.992 --> 08:14.619
I'm madder now than when I went in.

08:14.702 --> 08:18.956
Are you ready not to care? There, healed!
What did he whisper to you, anyway?

08:19.040 --> 08:22.126
Oh, he told me if I wanted
to have a fulfilling relationship,

08:22.210 --> 08:24.337
I had to get the man out of my bed.

08:24.420 --> 08:27.507
What man? What man?
That's the whole point. There is no man.

08:27.590 --> 08:29.634
Metaphorical man. Metaphorical bed.

08:29.717 --> 08:31.052
-Fuckin' Mia.

08:31.135 --> 08:33.054
-I bet she gets a kickback.
-Pfft.

09:17.682 --> 09:20.309
Guy, come on, wake up!

09:20.393 --> 09:22.061
-Open your eyes!

09:23.604 --> 09:25.856
Hey, how's it goin'? Nice to see you.

09:26.732 --> 09:30.695
Wow! What do you got goin' on here?
Nice. Good to see you too.

09:30.778 --> 09:32.071
-Michael?
-Look at this.

09:32.154 --> 09:34.031
Hi!

09:36.242 --> 09:37.868
Beautiful day, isn't it?

09:38.578 --> 09:41.497
This city is so alive.

09:41.581 --> 09:45.042
The car honks, the buses, the crazies.

09:45.126 --> 09:46.752
It's like a symphony.

09:47.253 --> 09:50.673
And did you ever notice the pavement
sparkles here? What is that, quartz?

09:50.756 --> 09:52.925
Oh no, you're so happy.

09:53.426 --> 09:56.345
Like one of those people
who just decided to kill themselves.

09:56.929 --> 10:00.141
No, Stanley. I had an experience.

10:00.850 --> 10:03.102
I woke up this morning, and get this,

10:03.185 --> 10:07.440
I was awake for 36 minutes
before I once thought of Colin.

10:07.523 --> 10:09.817
Thirty-six minutes!

10:09.900 --> 10:12.111
He's, like, gone. He's not in me anymore.

10:12.194 --> 10:18.075
He is out there in this beautiful world,
having his own adventure.

10:18.159 --> 10:20.202
That's… good?

10:20.786 --> 10:22.121
Uh, it's a miracle.

10:22.204 --> 10:23.581
-He only crossed my mind

10:23.664 --> 10:26.751
when I saw a magazine addressed to him.

10:26.834 --> 10:29.545
<i>Psychology Today.</i> He's a new subscriber.

10:29.629 --> 10:31.172
Isn't that sad?

10:31.255 --> 10:34.508
Because clearly, he's suffering,

10:34.592 --> 10:37.803
and that must have been going on
for a long time before…

10:37.887 --> 10:42.141
-What's happening here?
-And all I feel is compassion. Not anger.

10:42.808 --> 10:46.145
He must have been so lonely,
and he hid that from me.

10:46.228 --> 10:49.649
That, along with all the moving boxes
and packing tape.

10:49.732 --> 10:51.400
I know!

10:51.484 --> 10:56.405
Poor Colin. You've gotta be
in such enormous pain to behave that way.

10:56.906 --> 11:00.034
-Are you crying for Colin?

11:00.117 --> 11:01.786
I'm crying for both of us.

11:02.578 --> 11:07.625
And now that I have, I feel like this
weight has lifted off me, and I'm free.

11:08.417 --> 11:12.046
I'm open. And the world
has already responded.

11:12.588 --> 11:14.173
I got one of my clients to make an offer

11:14.256 --> 11:16.509
-on that one-bedroom in Chelsea.

11:16.592 --> 11:18.803
And you know that
that only happened because--

11:20.721 --> 11:25.768
Josh Gibson. The dermatologist
my dad's trying to set me up with.

11:25.851 --> 11:28.562
-I don't trust the universe that much.
-Do you trust Google?

11:28.646 --> 11:31.899
I'm not sure being pimped out by your dad

11:31.982 --> 11:34.860
isn't the greatest idea of all time!

11:34.944 --> 11:36.237
Oh my God!

11:37.613 --> 11:39.198
See what happens when you're open?

11:40.282 --> 11:41.826
-Oh, we're gonna hug again.
-Aw!

11:44.954 --> 11:48.708
Ben is one of my favorites,
so I figured I'd like his son.

11:49.625 --> 11:52.503
He's a problem-solver.
He wants me to get out there.

11:52.586 --> 11:54.213
You don't seem like much of a problem.

11:55.089 --> 11:57.550
Anyway, he didn't really
talk about you very much.

11:57.633 --> 12:02.138
He, uh… he just looked at me and he said,
"Do you have love in your life?"

12:02.930 --> 12:05.224
-Please tell me you're joking.
-It was really sweet.

12:05.307 --> 12:09.145
And very brave,
considering I had a scalpel in my hand.

12:09.228 --> 12:11.772
Then I said,
"No, not at the moment, but I'm open."

12:11.856 --> 12:13.315
And then he suggested you,

12:13.399 --> 12:16.527
which was a huge relief,
considering he's not exactly my type.

12:16.610 --> 12:18.863
I'm incredibly grateful
I take after my mom.

12:18.946 --> 12:22.241
Not that I love dating.
There are a lot of weird guys out there.

12:23.325 --> 12:25.995
Oh my God. I know. It's crazy now.

12:26.078 --> 12:28.956
This guy the other night wanted
to have sex with me without a condom.

12:29.957 --> 12:31.584
Not how I was raised.

12:32.126 --> 12:34.712
Well, not that my parents
ever actually talked to me about sex.

12:34.795 --> 12:37.298
They'd just tune the clock radio
to Dr. Ruth.

12:37.381 --> 12:39.383
Mm. I miss clock radios.

12:39.467 --> 12:41.343
So now I don't date anyone under 40.

12:42.845 --> 12:44.972
Which may mean that we are not a match?

12:45.598 --> 12:47.349
I'm both flattered

12:47.433 --> 12:51.061
and extremely worried that you operate
on my dad with such poor eyesight.

12:53.814 --> 12:54.815
Well, this has been fun.

12:57.234 --> 12:58.068
What next?

12:58.944 --> 13:02.114
Oh, uh, listen, I like you a lot.
I've been having fun as well.

13:02.198 --> 13:05.117
But I'm not ready
to have sex on a first date.

13:05.201 --> 13:06.410
Oh! You--

13:06.994 --> 13:09.663
You-- you thought that we were
gonna have sex tonight?

13:10.372 --> 13:12.792
Uh, no, I've been eating pasta.
I meant dessert.

13:12.875 --> 13:14.335
Oh, thank God.

13:14.418 --> 13:16.295
-Let's order all the desserts.
-Yes!

13:19.548 --> 13:21.133
I opened myself up to the world,

13:21.217 --> 13:25.095
and the world delivered this beautiful
dermatologist, and it just clicked.

13:25.179 --> 13:26.514
It's so easy for you gay guys.

13:26.597 --> 13:28.516
The wedding announcements
in <i>The New York Times?</i>

13:28.599 --> 13:30.309
Not a vagina or veil in sight.

13:30.392 --> 13:33.229
If you don't count lesbians, which I do,
since that's where I'm heading.

13:33.312 --> 13:34.230
And he's a grown-up.

13:34.313 --> 13:37.608
He's accompanying me to Stanley's opening
tonight. Great, right?

13:37.691 --> 13:38.943
Mm. Hooray.

13:39.026 --> 13:41.195
Fucking healer. Where's my hot doctor?

13:41.278 --> 13:43.572
Oh, I think we let this broker suffer
long enough.

13:43.656 --> 13:44.490
Right, yeah.

13:44.990 --> 13:49.245
Hey, Richard, look, I've been wrestling
with my buyer for the last half hour.

13:49.328 --> 13:53.415
No, wait, stop. Don't pull the offer.
Just give me one minute, please!

13:53.499 --> 13:55.960
I keep telling her it's a great deal
for a one-bedroom.

13:56.043 --> 13:59.296
I think she'll come up to your seller's
number if you guys cover closing costs.

13:59.380 --> 14:00.881
No, no, no!

14:00.965 --> 14:02.508
Sorry, Richard, she's pushing back.

14:02.591 --> 14:03.759
Should I tell her no deal,

14:03.843 --> 14:06.720
then you tell your clients to take
their chances in this market and wait?

14:08.430 --> 14:11.058
Absolutely. Good call, Richard. Thank you.

14:11.934 --> 14:13.352
-He folded. We closed!
-Ah!

14:13.435 --> 14:14.478
-Whoo!

14:14.562 --> 14:17.857
First Claire's penthouse,
and now this sweet one-bedroom?

14:17.940 --> 14:19.233
We are back, Suzanne!

14:19.316 --> 14:21.694
No, you're back.
I'm still waitin' on my miracle cure.

14:21.777 --> 14:23.028
Come to Stanley's opening.

14:23.112 --> 14:24.405
-You could meet someone.
-No.

14:24.488 --> 14:27.283
I'm staying in.
Other people's happiness is very tiring.

14:28.951 --> 14:31.328
Seriously, your dates ask you
for free exams?

14:31.412 --> 14:34.665
All the time. Before, during, and after.

14:34.748 --> 14:36.959
-Some guys get dick pics. I get moles.
-Oh!

14:37.042 --> 14:40.337
When Apple sends me my "On This Day"
photo, it is always horrifying.

14:40.421 --> 14:42.423
Well, thank you for doing this.

14:42.506 --> 14:46.635
It's, uh… it's for a famous German artist
named Wilhelm Munsch.

14:46.719 --> 14:51.390
Ah. Great. I love looking at art.
I get tired of tea dances and raves.

14:51.473 --> 14:53.642
I mean, not everything
has to be so gay, gay, gay--

14:55.853 --> 14:56.896
Huh.

14:58.772 --> 15:02.985
-We don't have to stay long.

15:05.321 --> 15:06.989
Welcome to <i>Butt Munsch.</i>

15:07.072 --> 15:10.200
You must be the doctor.
I'm Stanley. This is Billy.

15:10.284 --> 15:14.163
We could use a dermatologist friend.
Stanley's got more tags than a yard sale.

15:14.246 --> 15:16.999
-Ah! Any time.
-Loving the '70s vibe.

15:17.082 --> 15:20.085
It's 1978, the year
of his first appearance

15:20.169 --> 15:23.505
in Berlin's premier gay periodical,
<i>Das Butt.</i>

15:23.589 --> 15:26.634
I even turned the loading dock
into a back room.

15:26.717 --> 15:29.720
But people are shy.
Please, have sex there.

15:30.346 --> 15:31.555
Oh, I think we're good.

15:32.056 --> 15:34.391
Ooh! Here's Willie. Welcome!

15:34.475 --> 15:36.936
We were just saying
how beautiful everything looks.

15:37.019 --> 15:39.521
-Yeah, it's-- Whew!
-Yes. Very, um… vivid. Very…

15:39.605 --> 15:41.065
-Bzz, bzz…
-Stirring.

15:41.148 --> 15:44.860
How kind. Between you and me,
this is not even my best stuff.

15:44.944 --> 15:46.987
Look at that one, Friedrich.

15:47.071 --> 15:51.241
That model could have been your father.
You have the same…

15:51.909 --> 15:53.827
Why do you think anyone will pay for this?

15:53.911 --> 15:56.705
I mean, we have Pornhub now.
And I haven't seen any red dots.

15:56.789 --> 15:58.958
Except on that one waiter's ass.

15:59.458 --> 16:01.502
-Hmm.
-Ah, sorry, I'm off the clock.

16:01.585 --> 16:04.630
This crowd will buy, trust me.
Once Stossel primes the pump--

16:04.713 --> 16:06.548
He's a big gay art collector.

16:06.632 --> 16:08.759
I've bet the farm on this,
and I'm never wrong.

16:08.842 --> 16:11.512
-Thanks for the support, Billy. As always.

16:11.595 --> 16:14.264
Great. He's ten minutes away.

16:15.099 --> 16:17.393
How do you get fired from a internship?

16:17.476 --> 16:19.937
Because I'm a musician,
not a sound engineer.

16:20.020 --> 16:21.021
Oh!

16:21.105 --> 16:23.482
Well, okay. Maybe it's for the best.

16:23.565 --> 16:26.151
You can find a job
that might actually pay you.

16:27.194 --> 16:29.279
<i>Once in a while, you could flirt with me.</i>

16:29.363 --> 16:31.657
Ooh! We're in luck! A rom-com marathon.

16:33.826 --> 16:34.910
Ooh!

16:36.870 --> 16:40.165
<i>-What is this? Ice cream is flirting.</i>

16:40.249 --> 16:41.125
<i>Mm.</i>

16:41.208 --> 16:43.419
By the way,
the Jordans want us for dinner next week.

16:43.502 --> 16:45.963
Fine. But let's tell them
we have an early morning.

16:46.046 --> 16:47.673
Totally. Love him. Hate her.

16:47.756 --> 16:50.968
<i>I'm just being friendly.</i>
<i>Besides, I'm on the co-op board.</i>

16:51.051 --> 16:55.055
<i>You know, sometimes they say</i>
<i>ice cream tastes better when it's melted.</i>

16:56.098 --> 16:58.559
<i>Should we let it rest for an hour?</i>

16:59.059 --> 17:00.060
<i>An hour?</i>

17:00.936 --> 17:02.771
<i>Okay, now you're flattering me.</i>

17:02.855 --> 17:04.565
-<i>Ah!</i>

17:04.648 --> 17:06.775
Oh my God!

17:07.609 --> 17:09.778
-Oh my God, it's you!
-What?

17:09.862 --> 17:13.282
You're the man in my bed!
There's no room for any hot doctor.

17:13.782 --> 17:17.661
Get out! Get out, get out, get out!
Get your ass out!

17:21.665 --> 17:22.666
That's one.

17:22.750 --> 17:24.585
I remember when you were at Channel Five.

17:24.668 --> 17:27.838
That feature that you did
on Hurricane Sandy. Yes, it was amazing.

17:28.464 --> 17:30.340
I had no idea you were gay.

17:31.050 --> 17:33.177
I would say thank you,
but I'm too evolved.

17:33.260 --> 17:34.094
Huh.

17:34.178 --> 17:36.138
-But thank you.

17:37.431 --> 17:40.976
Oh, a patient just clocked me.
I should go and say hi. Excuse me.

17:44.229 --> 17:46.982
He's great. How's the sex?

17:47.066 --> 17:50.152
No idea. We're takin' it slow.
I wanna get to know him as a person.

17:50.235 --> 17:51.528
God, why?

17:51.612 --> 17:52.654
Mr. Stossel!

17:53.447 --> 17:55.407
Welcome to <i>Butt Munsch.</i>

17:55.491 --> 17:58.494
Allow me to take you through
the exhibition. There's a progression.

17:58.577 --> 18:01.455
From singles, to doubles, to quintuples,

18:01.538 --> 18:04.041
with a corresponding movement
from front to back,

18:04.124 --> 18:06.710
to back to back, to back on back.

18:06.794 --> 18:09.505
That won't be necessary.

18:11.048 --> 18:14.176
I am an art collector, Mr. James.

18:15.761 --> 18:18.347
This isn't art.

18:19.515 --> 18:20.432
It's porn.

18:20.516 --> 18:21.475
Worse.

18:22.601 --> 18:23.811
Cartoon porn.

18:25.187 --> 18:28.190
Oh my God.
Stanley's got everything riding on this.

18:31.985 --> 18:33.237
Uh… Mr. James.

18:35.656 --> 18:39.326
Is <i>Leather Urinal </i>still available?

18:39.910 --> 18:40.786
Um…

18:41.620 --> 18:42.704
Yes?

18:43.664 --> 18:46.875
Not anymore.
Where are your little red dots?

18:51.338 --> 18:55.425
What a relief. It's so hard
to buy for Anderson Cooper.

18:55.509 --> 18:57.177
I was actually looking at that one.

18:57.261 --> 19:00.055
Fortunately, I have another
from the same period.

19:00.139 --> 19:01.557
Let me show you <i>Pig Trough.</i>

19:03.350 --> 19:04.184
Thank you.

19:04.726 --> 19:06.728
Ahem. It's right over here.

19:08.397 --> 19:11.400
Well played. You're a good friend.

19:11.483 --> 19:12.317
Thank you.

19:13.944 --> 19:16.613
He won't really make me
pay for that, will he?

19:19.783 --> 19:23.412
This is so weird.
I swear I remember this one.

19:23.495 --> 19:24.746
Oh my God, yes.

19:24.830 --> 19:28.041
It was on a postcard I bought
in the Village in the tenth grade.

19:28.125 --> 19:30.002
I was a nervous wreck on the bus home,

19:30.085 --> 19:32.713
clutching my backpack
like Gollum with the ring.

19:34.131 --> 19:35.674
It was ninth grade for me.

19:36.341 --> 19:40.345
Somebody shoved it in my locker
with "faggot" scrawled across the back.

19:40.429 --> 19:41.513
But the front,

19:42.764 --> 19:43.682
perfect.

19:45.267 --> 19:47.477
It was the pride and joy
of my teenage wank bank.

19:47.561 --> 19:48.437
Me too.

19:48.520 --> 19:49.688
Wild.

19:50.272 --> 19:52.441
It's like the universe…

20:00.699 --> 20:03.493
-Is that your first one?
-I haven't eaten a thing all day.

20:15.214 --> 20:17.758
-This part feels like Christmas morning.
-Oh yeah.

20:17.841 --> 20:19.509
-Opening presents.

20:19.593 --> 20:22.137
-Mm!
-I hope you like what Santa brought you.

20:25.265 --> 20:26.558
Best Christmas ever.

20:27.851 --> 20:28.977
All right, my turn.

20:30.145 --> 20:31.313
Oh!

20:32.689 --> 20:34.733
Whoa, it just keeps on going.

20:34.816 --> 20:38.445
Congratulations to your parents,
Paul and Mary Bunyan.

20:39.279 --> 20:40.530
I hope you're not a grower.

20:40.614 --> 20:43.242
Oh my God! You are.

20:43.784 --> 20:45.327
Oh, wow!

20:45.410 --> 20:49.957
Okay, well, fortunately,
I can unhinge my jaw like a python.

20:50.040 --> 20:51.291
Oh, actually, um…

20:52.209 --> 20:53.377
I was hoping that

20:54.336 --> 20:55.254
I could…

20:56.922 --> 20:58.966
Seriously? With that thing?

20:59.049 --> 21:00.217
I'll go easy.

21:04.096 --> 21:05.973
-You are so tense.
-I… Uh…

21:06.056 --> 21:06.974
Um…

21:07.057 --> 21:08.642
-Come here.
-Okay.

21:12.980 --> 21:14.940
-Just relax.
-I'm sorry.

21:15.023 --> 21:18.694
I've just been accustomed to a certain
size and circumference for a lot of years,

21:18.777 --> 21:21.446
and it's kind of minor league
with what you got goin' on down there.

21:21.530 --> 21:24.241
You know, I have heard that before.

21:25.117 --> 21:28.328
And, um… there is a workaround.

21:28.412 --> 21:30.163
What, poppers and a prayer?

21:34.042 --> 21:37.796
I can use an anal paralytic.
It's off-label, but it works like a charm.

21:37.879 --> 21:38.714
What…

21:39.631 --> 21:41.425
You wanna Botox my butthole?

21:41.508 --> 21:43.427
Just a few ccs.

21:43.510 --> 21:47.222
It'll deaden the sphincter reflex,
and then, pah! I'm in.

21:47.306 --> 21:50.058
There is not one word in that sentence
that doesn't terrify me.

21:50.142 --> 21:52.811
Don't worry, I'm great with the needle.
You will hardly feel a thing.

21:52.894 --> 21:53.812
Hardly--

21:53.895 --> 21:56.481
Come on. You spent all night
telling me how open you are.

21:56.565 --> 21:58.275
Yeah, spiritually!

21:58.358 --> 22:02.654
Um, I don't really want you
to Botox my ass,

22:02.738 --> 22:05.073
and, sidebar, when would it snap back?

22:05.157 --> 22:09.161
How long would I walk around
with an asshole like a loose turtleneck?

22:09.745 --> 22:12.331
I… I'm sorry. I… I can't do this.

22:12.414 --> 22:14.958
Wait, no. It wa-- it was just an idea.
Look, see?

22:15.042 --> 22:17.294
-What are you doin'?
-I'm not supposed to be here.

22:17.794 --> 22:21.673
I'm not supposed to know about
Botoxed buttholes, and PrEP,

22:21.757 --> 22:23.884
and-- and no condoms.

22:23.967 --> 22:26.595
I am supposed to be
sitting on my couch watching TV

22:26.678 --> 22:29.639
while my boyfriend
is chewing way too loud beside me.

22:29.723 --> 22:32.601
That is the world that I want.
I miss that world, and I want it back.

22:32.684 --> 22:33.977
And if I can't have it back,

22:34.061 --> 22:37.481
then I want it to be a year from now,
or ten years,

22:37.564 --> 22:41.360
and all this pain and anger
and change will be over.

22:41.443 --> 22:44.946
Okay, I get it, I get it. I really do.
Can I just say one thing?

22:45.781 --> 22:46.615
Sure.

22:47.491 --> 22:48.784
How about just the tip?

22:58.668 --> 23:02.464
No, he's a great guy, Dad, really,
and it started out well. It just…

23:03.882 --> 23:05.550
wasn't a good fit.

23:05.634 --> 23:06.510
I gotta go.

23:06.593 --> 23:09.596
Good news. The loan funded into escrow,

23:09.679 --> 23:12.849
we close the Claire deal in two weeks,
Raffi almost smiled.

23:12.933 --> 23:17.312
Oh, and guess what? The asshole guru,
teacher, whatever, was right about me too.

23:17.896 --> 23:20.816
I realized who the man in my bed is.

23:20.899 --> 23:21.983
Kai, my son.

23:22.734 --> 23:23.985
-Ew.
-I know.

23:24.069 --> 23:26.947
When I think of all the times I reach
for the remote without looking. Ugh!

23:27.030 --> 23:30.367
Could've been a Freudian nightmare.
We gotta find him his own place stat.

23:30.450 --> 23:33.036
And I gotta get back out there
and find somebody that turns me on.

23:33.787 --> 23:36.581
Well, good luck with that.
Out there is no fun.

23:37.457 --> 23:39.000
What happened to the doctor?

23:39.084 --> 23:40.293
It all went away!

23:40.377 --> 23:44.923
The guy, the forgiveness, the compassion.
I'm right where I was.

23:45.006 --> 23:48.051
It's now, it's not a year from now,
and now sucks!

23:48.135 --> 23:50.720
I know you're mad, honey,
but we're gonna need that stapler.

23:50.804 --> 23:54.391
I'm just gonna grow older and older,
until one day, I'm Jack.

23:54.474 --> 23:57.602
-Who's Jack?
-Old guy that lives on my floor.

23:57.686 --> 24:01.356
Keeps putting Post-it notes on my door,
asking me over for drinks.

24:01.440 --> 24:03.442
Because we have so much in common.

24:03.525 --> 24:05.569
Gay, old, alone.

24:05.652 --> 24:07.404
I got one of those in my building too.

24:07.487 --> 24:09.239
Three hairs here, 20 down here.

24:09.322 --> 24:11.366
You'll kill me
before that happens, won't you?

24:18.206 --> 24:19.458
Michael Lawson!

24:23.003 --> 24:26.465
I thought I saw you
back there in the market. I waved!

24:26.548 --> 24:29.676
Did you see the skinny ice cream on sale?

24:29.759 --> 24:32.679
Three hundred calories for the whole pint!

24:33.388 --> 24:35.932
Not that you need it.

24:36.016 --> 24:40.061
Look at you. Snake hips.
That's what we used to call it.

24:40.145 --> 24:41.688
Thanks, I think?

24:41.771 --> 24:44.274
Don't you miss the way things used to be?

24:44.357 --> 24:46.401
Only every minute of every day.

24:46.902 --> 24:48.028
That's why I'm moving.

24:48.612 --> 24:49.488
Miami.

24:50.405 --> 24:52.532
Can't take the winters anymore.

24:53.783 --> 24:59.498
I'm thinking, if I can get two… 2.2,
with a good Realtor…

24:59.581 --> 25:01.082
You think you can handle that?

25:01.958 --> 25:04.002
Wait, you want me to sell your--

25:04.085 --> 25:05.545
Who else?

25:05.629 --> 25:09.549
I left a few notes on your door,
but if you're too busy…

25:09.633 --> 25:11.885
No, right, of course you did.

25:11.968 --> 25:13.220
I'm sorry, Jack.

25:13.303 --> 25:15.764
I can definitely handle it. Thank you.

25:15.847 --> 25:19.100
Sorry. I'm just a little thrown.
I was not expecting something good.

25:21.186 --> 25:22.312
It's been a hard week.

25:23.271 --> 25:24.314
Hard couple of weeks.

25:24.814 --> 25:27.859
My lover, he died 23 years ago.

25:27.943 --> 25:30.779
I thought I would never get over it.

25:30.862 --> 25:33.365
But you do. Eventually.

25:33.448 --> 25:36.326
It's a journey. No shortcuts.

25:37.744 --> 25:39.579
Didn't anyone ever tell you that?

25:40.455 --> 25:42.541
Yeah, actually.

25:42.624 --> 25:45.210
A kind of guru, once.

25:45.293 --> 25:48.630
Lucky you. I had nuns.

25:51.341 --> 25:54.761
You can see right over the trees
on my floor.

25:55.720 --> 25:57.681
All New York.

25:59.140 --> 26:03.103
I'll miss it, but it's a young man's town.

26:03.186 --> 26:05.522
If I were your age…

26:07.315 --> 26:11.152
But you know that. How lucky you are.

26:11.236 --> 26:13.863
Everything in front of you.

26:16.283 --> 26:20.161
Hey, Jack. What do you say
you show me your place,

26:20.662 --> 26:23.748
we crack open that skinny ice cream,
and talk prices?
