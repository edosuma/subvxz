02:18.755 --> 02:20.523
Hi. Are you here?

02:20.524 --> 02:22.325
I'm walking.

02:22.326 --> 02:24.260
Call me when you
get to the door.

02:24.261 --> 02:25.862
I'll be there in a minute.

02:25.863 --> 02:27.363
Okay. Call me.

02:27.364 --> 02:28.699
You're all, uh, set up?

02:29.833 --> 02:31.601
Yes.

02:31.602 --> 02:33.903
You say good-bye to everybody?

02:33.904 --> 02:35.738
Mm-hmm. Yes.

02:35.739 --> 02:38.207
All right. Boxes are all done?

02:38.208 --> 02:40.610
Yes, and I cleaned it up too.

02:40.611 --> 02:42.545
Very good.

02:42.546 --> 02:44.581
Yes, I behaved. As usual.

02:46.250 --> 02:47.417
As usual.

02:49.653 --> 02:51.888
Are you wearing a blue jacket?

02:51.889 --> 02:53.322
What?

02:53.323 --> 02:54.858
Are you wearing a blue jacket?

02:56.193 --> 02:57.660
Yes.

02:57.661 --> 03:00.396
Uh-huh. With your gray pants?

03:00.397 --> 03:02.431
Uh, yes.

03:02.432 --> 03:04.734
And your brown bag?

03:04.735 --> 03:06.269
Yes.

03:06.270 --> 03:07.537
What is this?

03:07.538 --> 03:08.539
Look up.

03:09.473 --> 03:10.640
Up, up.

03:10.641 --> 03:11.708
Here.

03:12.609 --> 03:14.510
Hola.

03:14.511 --> 03:16.379
Hey. Last cigarette?

03:16.380 --> 03:17.548
Yes.

03:19.216 --> 03:21.350
You coming down?

03:21.351 --> 03:24.487
I'll buzz you in
and you help me out.

03:24.488 --> 03:25.855
Are you done with the present?

03:25.856 --> 03:27.191
What present?

03:28.959 --> 03:30.894
Yours, the one
for the Institute.

03:31.862 --> 03:33.363
I wrote you about it.

03:34.264 --> 03:36.632
Uh, I-I forgot.

03:36.633 --> 03:39.602
Not a big deal.
Send it afterwards.

03:39.603 --> 03:41.205
No, I'll forget again.

03:42.372 --> 03:44.607
I'll remind you. Sorry?

03:44.608 --> 03:46.409
Just send it from Buenos Aires.

03:46.410 --> 03:47.910
They'll appreciate it.

03:47.911 --> 03:49.913
No, I'll work something out.

03:51.248 --> 03:52.683
When are you supposed to leave?

03:54.384 --> 03:55.786
Now.

03:58.855 --> 04:01.424
I think it's a nice idea.
Not too cheap?

04:01.425 --> 04:03.793
No, I think it's nice
and simple and personal.

04:03.794 --> 04:06.362
Intimate.
Yeah, they'll appreciate it.

04:06.363 --> 04:08.965
Can you do it? Uh, sure.

04:08.966 --> 04:10.933
Let's keep this
stacked like this.

04:10.934 --> 04:13.236
Frame it between
two pieces of glass.

04:13.237 --> 04:15.371
Maybe put some screws
in the corners.

04:15.372 --> 04:16.973
Be a curious little object.

04:16.974 --> 04:19.274
They'll be able to hang it
wherever they like.

04:19.276 --> 04:21.877
Yeah, they'll put it up on the
wall with the rest of the fellows.

04:21.878 --> 04:23.546
You have my address, don't you?

04:23.547 --> 04:24.881
Uh...

04:28.819 --> 04:31.587
"Carmen Acevedo."

04:31.588 --> 04:36.525
Avenida Rivadavia 3622,
apartment 5B, C1204AAO.

04:36.526 --> 04:38.027
"Buenos Aires, Argentina."

04:38.028 --> 04:40.429
You should come with me.
Yeah, why not?

04:40.430 --> 04:42.665
We could be something, the two of us.
We had our moments.

04:42.666 --> 04:43.866
Come.

04:43.867 --> 04:45.835
You're a fast traveler.

04:45.836 --> 04:47.403
You have my address.

04:47.404 --> 04:49.573
You could just stay too.
I'll come back.

04:51.375 --> 04:52.808
Sign this.

04:52.809 --> 04:54.710
What is it?

04:54.711 --> 04:57.480
It's a paper that says you are
finished and satisfied

04:57.481 --> 04:59.348
with your year
at the Institute,

04:59.349 --> 05:01.317
that you accomplished
all of your tasks

05:01.318 --> 05:03.386
and that you have nothing
to complain about.

05:03.387 --> 05:06.489
You are very professional.
I like my job.

05:06.490 --> 05:08.391
You can leave
your keys with me.

05:08.392 --> 05:09.825
When will my things arrive?

05:09.826 --> 05:12.028
Two weeks. Is that okay?

05:12.029 --> 05:14.864
We can do faster shipping, you'd
just have to pay for it yourself.

05:14.865 --> 05:16.300
Two weeks is okay.

07:11.987 --> 07:14.487
- I got lost. I'm sorry.
- Hello. Come in.

07:15.070 --> 07:16.862
The room upstairs is locked.

07:18.320 --> 07:21.487
I'm leaving my stuff there.

07:24.903 --> 07:26.820
It's your home now.

07:26.862 --> 07:28.112
Thanks.

07:28.528 --> 07:32.153
Lukas will give you my old keys.

07:32.195 --> 07:34.403
- Lukas from the e-mails?
- Yes, that Lukas.

07:35.153 --> 07:38.237
I'm sending this gift
to replace the one I left.

07:38.278 --> 07:40.528
I wrote to him, but he never answered.

07:40.570 --> 07:42.237
My other gift should be taken down.

07:42.278 --> 07:44.737
- What's this gift?
- A painting.

07:44.778 --> 07:46.778
Make sure he throws out the other.

07:46.820 --> 07:49.153
- Will I have to leave a gift?
- Yes.

07:49.195 --> 07:54.653
You have to leave something
intimate about your time at the Institute.

07:54.695 --> 07:56.528
- Intimate?
- Yes, intimate.

07:57.695 --> 07:59.195
What did you leave them?

07:59.237 --> 08:00.917
I didn't have much time to think about it.

08:00.945 --> 08:03.653
And now I don't like what I left.
It's hanging there under my name.

08:03.695 --> 08:06.278
- I wouldn't worry.
- I'd rather they change it.

08:08.153 --> 08:10.070
You'll be the improved version of me.

08:10.112 --> 08:12.445
After me, I'm surprised they took you.

08:12.487 --> 08:15.362
- It wasn't good?
- Others seemed to like it.

08:15.403 --> 08:18.153
I'm always suspicious of fellowships.

08:18.195 --> 08:22.570
But I wanted to follow in your steps.

08:22.612 --> 08:24.320
It didn't change me.

08:24.362 --> 08:26.237
- And your project?
- I'm almost done.

08:26.278 --> 08:27.903
- You didn't finish?
- No.

08:27.945 --> 08:29.778
- Don't they say anything?
- No.

08:29.820 --> 08:32.195
When I'm finish,
maybe I'll feel different.

08:32.236 --> 08:35.320
- I hope to finish there.
- Translations are easier.

08:35.361 --> 08:37.195
As long as you don't get distracted.

08:37.236 --> 08:40.653
I'll come back and start rehearsals.

08:40.695 --> 08:44.903
Your project requires you to come back.

08:44.945 --> 08:48.945
I could have stayed there
writing indefinitely.

08:48.987 --> 08:51.445
It's more than long enough for me.

08:51.487 --> 08:54.528
A year wasn't enough to change me.

08:54.570 --> 08:58.862
I'm still single, the same job,
same friends, same problems.

08:58.903 --> 09:00.320
But you've met people.

09:00.362 --> 09:02.112
No one interesting.

09:02.153 --> 09:03.487
You didn't have a good time?

09:03.528 --> 09:05.737
I'm just telling you how it was for me.

09:05.778 --> 09:08.570
I almost canceled.

09:08.612 --> 09:11.528
- Why?
- I'm happy here. So why should I change?

09:11.570 --> 09:14.320
I could translate sitting right here.

09:14.362 --> 09:15.903
So, why didn't you cancel?

09:15.945 --> 09:17.737
I thought they would never accept me.

09:17.778 --> 09:20.945
When they took me, I couldn't even think.

09:20.987 --> 09:25.320
I had just started going out with Leo,
so it didn't seem like a big problem.

09:25.362 --> 09:30.403
But between the idea of departure
and the actual departure,

09:30.445 --> 09:33.403
things with Leo got serious.

09:33.445 --> 09:36.070
And when I wanted to cancel,
it was too late.

09:36.112 --> 09:38.278
Anyway, I'm always up for contradiction.

09:38.320 --> 09:41.278
Don't worry. Go and come back.

09:41.320 --> 09:43.112
I did so, and everything is the same.

09:43.153 --> 09:45.112
That's a relief.

09:45.153 --> 09:46.695
Just be careful of Lukas.

09:46.737 --> 09:49.320
Your contradictory nature
might draw you to him.

09:49.362 --> 09:50.945
I don't like Americans.

09:50.987 --> 09:52.320
Well, me neither.

09:52.362 --> 09:55.487
But you also don't like to
travel and today you travel.

09:55.528 --> 09:59.153
- Did you ‟contradict” yourself with him?
- No, I'm more of a liar.

09:59.195 --> 10:00.903
- Did you sleep with Lukas?
- No.

10:00.945 --> 10:03.612
You'll see he resembles
the guys from here.

10:03.653 --> 10:06.403
- Should I take a message to him?
- Yes. "Throw away my old gift.”

10:06.445 --> 10:09.445
- Look, a gift from Leo.
- They have a hole.

10:09.487 --> 10:11.945
I now feel this Lukas is one
of the Institute's traditions

10:11.987 --> 10:13.695
and that I won't be able to resist him.

10:13.737 --> 10:15.487
- And he's very professional.
- So am I.

10:15.528 --> 10:18.153
I'll finish my project early
and return in less than a year.

10:18.195 --> 10:20.570
- Or contradict yourself again.
- We'll see.

10:20.612 --> 10:22.987
- Be sure to touch his hair.
- He'll think of you.

10:23.028 --> 10:24.903
And like it twice as much.

10:24.945 --> 10:27.028
- Leo's at the door.
- Let's go.

10:30.612 --> 10:32.278
Let's begin. Camila, where to?

10:32.320 --> 10:33.612
To Barbara's.

10:33.653 --> 10:34.903
And after that?

10:34.945 --> 10:37.445
To my mother's.

10:37.487 --> 10:40.195
- Then we'll pick you up from Barbara's.
- And then to Mariana's.

10:40.237 --> 10:43.487
To pick up a mattress.
Then we'll come back here.

10:43.528 --> 10:45.028
And then, to the airport.

10:45.070 --> 10:47.320
- Come for dinner after, Leo.
- Okay.

10:47.362 --> 10:48.862
You drive, Carmen.

10:48.903 --> 10:50.445
- The keys?
- In the truck.

10:50.487 --> 10:52.153
Call us if you need anything.

10:52.195 --> 10:53.237
Okay.

12:50.120 --> 12:52.788
Hey, Soon-Ji? Yeah?

12:52.789 --> 12:54.456
Did you fill out
your application yet?

12:54.457 --> 12:56.458
What application?

12:56.459 --> 12:57.961
Camila.

13:00.196 --> 13:01.797
Take a shot.

13:01.798 --> 13:03.398
What? Take a shot.

13:03.399 --> 13:05.869
Oh, no. I am almost finished here.
Thank you.

13:10.695 --> 13:13.903
I'm going there a lot,
to finish the translation.

13:15.195 --> 13:18.278
Send me a photo of you not working.

13:18.320 --> 13:19.778
Any photo?

13:20.987 --> 13:25.528
Something not at home or at the Institute.

13:25.570 --> 13:27.570
Why would you want that?

13:28.403 --> 13:30.445
So you do something different.

13:30.487 --> 13:32.112
Fine, I will.

13:33.112 --> 13:34.487
What are you doing today?

13:35.153 --> 13:38.028
I work,
then meet with Sergio and your sister.

13:38.070 --> 13:40.278
Are you seeing them a lot?

13:41.445 --> 13:44.320
Yes, he called me yesterday.

13:44.362 --> 13:46.195
Oh, it's late.

13:46.237 --> 13:48.153
I have to go to work.

13:48.195 --> 13:49.403
Fine.

13:49.445 --> 13:50.695
You look very cute.

13:51.237 --> 13:52.903
Thank you, babe.

13:52.945 --> 13:55.278
Send you a big kiss.

13:56.028 --> 13:58.237
- Bye.
- I love you.

13:58.278 --> 13:59.403
- Bye.
- Bye.

14:44.601 --> 14:46.501
And it helps me to focus.

14:46.502 --> 14:49.137
I do much more work here
than in the Institute.

14:49.138 --> 14:51.607
I think I will be able to go
back home before I expected to.

14:51.608 --> 14:53.075
That's a pity.

14:53.076 --> 14:55.544
Why? It is nice
that I am working so well.

14:55.545 --> 14:58.013
Imagine if I had been
distracted all this time,

14:58.014 --> 15:00.649
like playing the tourist
or being everybody's friend.

15:00.650 --> 15:03.318
I would have done nothing.
Like some people we know?

15:03.319 --> 15:05.254
Who? Soon-Ji? No, Carmen.

15:05.255 --> 15:07.656
But she finished a short
novel here, didn't she?

15:07.657 --> 15:09.992
I don't know. Have you read it?
No.

15:09.993 --> 15:11.927
Are you in touch with her?
Not really.

15:11.928 --> 15:14.429
I e-mailed but never
heard anything back.

15:14.430 --> 15:16.064
Do you know what it is?

15:16.065 --> 15:17.566
A portrait of you?

15:17.567 --> 15:20.269
Have you thought about your present?
Not really.

15:20.270 --> 15:22.237
Don't leave it till the end.
Sure.

15:22.238 --> 15:23.406
I'm not Carmen.

15:37.220 --> 15:39.254
Do you think
she did it herself?

15:39.255 --> 15:41.056
Yes, it's Photoshop.

15:41.057 --> 15:43.058
Get used to it.
It will be here.

15:43.059 --> 15:45.260
Where? We'll see.

15:45.261 --> 15:47.062
It's good that it finally came.

15:47.063 --> 15:49.197
What should we do
with the old one?

15:49.198 --> 15:51.601
Just keep it here till I
bring this one back. Okay.

16:03.820 --> 16:06.195
Sorry, I'm late.

16:06.237 --> 16:08.403
- When did you arrive?
- A few hours ago.

16:09.320 --> 16:10.653
You're okay?

16:10.695 --> 16:12.903
- Your gloves.
- What a shame.

16:12.945 --> 16:14.945
- You're an awful girlfriend.
- Was he upset?

16:14.987 --> 16:17.612
He asked me to bring them to you.

16:17.653 --> 16:20.820
- Coffee?
- No, I have to go to the airport.

16:20.862 --> 16:23.237
- Can you take a picture of me?
- Sure.

16:57.195 --> 16:59.153
Have you seen Carmen?

16:59.195 --> 17:00.695
Yes, she moved your furniture.

17:00.737 --> 17:02.278
She did?

17:03.903 --> 17:05.819
Yes, it looks good.

17:06.694 --> 17:08.319
I like that you're friends.

17:09.362 --> 17:12.987
She thinks we should all live together.

17:13.028 --> 17:16.653
I'd rather we rent a place by ourselves.

17:16.694 --> 17:19.028
Carmen is boring.

17:19.069 --> 17:20.987
I haven't saved much.

17:22.319 --> 17:24.653
Don't worry. Concentrate on work.

17:24.694 --> 17:26.194
We'll figure something out.

17:26.237 --> 17:27.319
Look.

17:28.153 --> 17:29.778
Another postcard for Carmen.

17:30.987 --> 17:32.737
From her secret friend?

17:32.778 --> 17:34.737
Yes, and it seems she's coming to visit.

17:56.028 --> 17:58.987
The wildest hath not such a heart as you.
Run when you will.

17:59.028 --> 18:02.278
The story shall be changed:
Apollo flies, and Daphne holds the chase.

18:02.320 --> 18:07.695
The dove pursues the griffin. The mild
hind makes speed to catch the tiger.

18:07.737 --> 18:10.737
Bootless speed,
when cowardice pursues and valor flies.

19:04.987 --> 19:10.487
I'll run from thee
and hide me in the brakes,

19:10.528 --> 19:15.195
and leave thee
to the mercy of wild beasts.

19:15.987 --> 19:17.403
‟Fieras”?

19:17.445 --> 19:18.373
I don't know.

19:18.374 --> 19:18.445
Beasts. I don't know.

19:18.446 --> 19:20.543
Beasts.

19:21.237 --> 19:25.903
The wildest hath not
such a heart as you...

19:25.945 --> 19:27.237
As you.

19:27.278 --> 19:32.487
Run when you will,
the story shall be changed:

19:32.528 --> 19:36.237
Apollo flies, and Daphne holds the chase.

19:36.278 --> 19:37.445
‟Caza”?

19:37.693 --> 19:38.611
Follow. "Follow."

19:38.612 --> 19:39.394
Follow. "Follow."
"Follow,” yes, very good.

19:39.395 --> 19:41.195
"Follow,” yes, very good.

19:41.237 --> 19:45.112
The dove pursues the griffin.

19:45.153 --> 19:49.987
The mild hind makes speed
to catch the tiger.

19:54.744 --> 19:56.277
Do you like maps?

19:56.278 --> 19:56.579
Do you like maps? Yes, a lot.

19:56.580 --> 19:58.112
Yes, a lot.

19:59.615 --> 20:00.736
You can keep them
if you'd like.

20:00.737 --> 20:01.283
You can keep them if you'd like.
No, it's okay.

20:01.284 --> 20:02.112
No, it's okay.

20:03.386 --> 20:04.652
It's a gift.

20:04.653 --> 20:04.687
It's a gift.
It's four classes, so that would be 400.

20:04.688 --> 20:07.737
It's four classes, so that would be 400.

20:09.492 --> 20:10.902
You don't accept credit,
do you?

20:10.903 --> 20:12.860
You don't accept credit, do you? Don't worry.
Pay the rest next class.

20:12.861 --> 20:12.860
Don't worry. Pay the rest next class.

20:12.861 --> 20:13.112
Okay.
Don't worry. Pay the rest next class.

20:13.113 --> 20:13.930
Okay.

20:15.865 --> 20:17.152
Finished with your translation?

20:17.153 --> 20:17.466
Finished with your translation?
In Spanish?

20:17.467 --> 20:18.362
In Spanish?

20:18.403 --> 20:21.445
Uh, finished with your translation?

20:22.028 --> 20:23.195
No, not yet.

21:38.195 --> 21:40.903
I know what to give the Institute.

21:41.862 --> 21:43.362
Already thinking about that?

21:43.403 --> 21:45.820
Yes. I want to get it out of the way.

21:47.112 --> 21:48.653
And the translation?

21:48.695 --> 21:49.737
It's there.

21:50.737 --> 21:51.945
Have you finished it?

21:51.987 --> 21:53.320
Almost.

21:53.362 --> 21:55.445
I need a break from work.

21:55.987 --> 21:58.778
I want to finish with this gift thing.

22:00.903 --> 22:02.112
What is it?

22:03.570 --> 22:05.987
I'm not exactly sure,
but I think it'll be good.

22:07.195 --> 22:08.362
Tell me.

22:08.987 --> 22:10.653
I have to wait a few more days.

22:10.695 --> 22:11.862
It'll be good.

22:15.384 --> 22:17.819
I guess it wasn't
a very good day.

22:17.820 --> 22:21.923
Oh, no. This is part of
my preparation.

22:21.924 --> 22:24.459
I stick part of the book
into my notebook

22:24.460 --> 22:27.762
so it's easier to start
scratching and taking notes.

22:27.763 --> 22:29.364
It's interesting.

22:29.365 --> 22:31.966
Yes. So, even if I get stuck,
I have something to do.

22:31.967 --> 22:33.935
Don't you exhaust yourself
at some point?

22:33.936 --> 22:35.604
Well, I might have tonight.

22:41.677 --> 22:43.678
Is this Danièle Nagy?

22:43.679 --> 22:44.979
Sorry?

22:44.980 --> 22:46.915
You are friends with Dan,
the French fellow?

22:46.916 --> 22:48.617
Oh, yes, I am.

22:50.386 --> 22:52.754
- Have you been there?
- To Montana, no.

22:52.755 --> 22:54.556
It's far away, you know.

22:54.557 --> 22:56.591
The Institute has whole other
building and people there.

22:56.592 --> 22:58.460
Only fellows travel.

22:58.461 --> 23:00.930
Last year it was Dan.
This year is this American poet.

23:02.698 --> 23:04.599
I had no idea Danièle
was still around.

23:04.600 --> 23:06.601
And it seems
she's coming to visit.

23:06.602 --> 23:07.902
She is intense.

23:07.903 --> 23:09.671
Did you go out with her too?

23:09.672 --> 23:11.039
No.

23:11.040 --> 23:14.376
She was like you, very
reclusive, into her things.

23:14.377 --> 23:15.644
Secretive.

23:16.779 --> 23:18.546
Soon-Ji is applying
for next semester.

23:18.547 --> 23:19.881
Maybe you should go to Montana?

23:19.882 --> 23:21.883
It might suit you more
than New York.

23:21.884 --> 23:25.053
I don't know.
I'm fine with going back home.

23:25.054 --> 23:26.721
What are you here for?

23:26.722 --> 23:28.156
I came to pick up
some equipment.

23:28.157 --> 23:29.758
I'm doing some recording
these days.

23:29.759 --> 23:32.127
Another job?
A personal project.

23:32.128 --> 23:33.828
So you are like
any other fellow.

23:33.829 --> 23:35.029
I was one, you know.

23:35.030 --> 23:37.399
When? About five years ago.

23:37.400 --> 23:39.167
Did you finish your project?
Yeah.

23:39.168 --> 23:41.870
What was it? I'm a musician.

23:41.871 --> 23:43.538
Not just an office worker.

23:43.539 --> 23:46.007
Are you playing?
Not these days.

23:46.008 --> 23:47.542
If I did, would you come?

23:47.543 --> 23:48.943
What sort of music do you play?

23:48.944 --> 23:50.812
Rock. Good.

23:50.813 --> 23:53.081
If you tell me, I will go. Okay.

23:53.082 --> 23:55.850
Tomorrow I'm just recording
a friend though.

23:55.851 --> 23:58.654
I need an assistant.
But I have no idea.

23:59.622 --> 24:01.524
It's a paid job. I don't know.

24:02.091 --> 24:03.692
Think about it.

24:23.612 --> 24:25.881
Hey. Are you ready to go? Yep.

25:28.811 --> 25:30.745
I'm going home now.

25:30.746 --> 25:32.847
Are you sure? Yeah, I am sure.

25:32.848 --> 25:35.583
Are you going to be at the
Institute tomorrow? I don't know.

25:35.584 --> 25:37.919
Carmen's present is ready.
Oh, finally.

25:37.920 --> 25:40.756
I can bring it to you.
Okay, bring it.

25:42.091 --> 25:43.726
See you tomorrow. See you then.

27:52.388 --> 27:54.989
Excuse me. You are
Dan, aren't you?

27:54.990 --> 27:57.025
Yes. Hi, I'm Camila.

27:57.026 --> 27:58.926
I've been waiting for you.

27:58.927 --> 28:00.395
I'm a friend of Carmen.

28:00.396 --> 28:02.163
Oh, hi.

28:02.164 --> 28:04.232
Excuse me, who are you?
I'm Camila.

28:04.233 --> 28:06.334
Did you have a long journey?

28:06.335 --> 28:07.703
Well, kind of.

28:08.771 --> 28:10.972
Did Carmen told you?

28:10.973 --> 28:14.275
Not really. I've been
receiving your postcards.

28:14.276 --> 28:16.144
Carmen doesn't
live here anymore.

28:16.145 --> 28:17.311
What?

28:17.312 --> 28:18.747
She went back home.

28:19.915 --> 28:21.683
Is she okay? Yeah.

28:21.684 --> 28:24.285
She finished the
fellowship and went back.

28:24.286 --> 28:28.056
I'm now living in her apartment...
well, the Institute's apartment.

28:28.057 --> 28:30.292
You are a fellow?
Yes, I'm translating.

28:31.393 --> 28:34.429
She never mentioned
a Camila to me.

28:34.430 --> 28:36.130
She left a gift for you.

28:36.131 --> 28:37.399
I can bring it.

28:40.703 --> 28:42.804
How did you two meet?

28:42.805 --> 28:43.938
At college.

28:43.939 --> 28:45.807
Like we lost track
for some time

28:45.808 --> 28:48.943
and then we met again
at her book presentation.

28:48.944 --> 28:51.813
And you? She never
told you about me?

28:51.814 --> 28:54.182
No, Lukas did.

28:54.183 --> 28:57.318
What's Lukas?
Lukas, from the Institute.

28:57.319 --> 28:59.187
Oh, the tall boy.

28:59.188 --> 29:01.255
He told me you were expelled.

29:01.256 --> 29:03.891
It's not true.
There was not fire?

29:03.892 --> 29:07.361
It was an accident.
Something got burnt, a sofa.

29:07.362 --> 29:09.297
Was Carmen with you?

29:09.298 --> 29:11.499
Yes, it was
her cigarette actually.

29:11.500 --> 29:13.768
She never told you this either?

29:13.769 --> 29:15.002
No.

29:15.003 --> 29:17.406
Apparently
she's very secretive.

29:19.875 --> 29:22.143
Are you applying
for another fellowship?

29:22.144 --> 29:24.979
No, I can't. Mm, the fire?

29:24.980 --> 29:26.515
It's complicated everything.

29:28.851 --> 29:30.152
But I finished my book.

29:32.121 --> 29:33.387
Are you two close?

29:33.388 --> 29:35.823
Yes, we are.

29:35.824 --> 29:37.993
You're going back to Buenos Aires?
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

29:40.195 --> 29:43.097
Tell her I don't accept
her stupid gift.

29:43.098 --> 29:45.867
You can tell her yourself.
Give me her address then.

29:45.868 --> 29:47.802
I don't have it. She moved.

29:47.803 --> 29:50.104
You're not in touch anymore?

29:50.105 --> 29:52.273
Yes.

29:52.274 --> 29:56.477
I think, like, if you go directly
to her she may not answer.

29:56.478 --> 29:58.412
What do you mean?

29:58.413 --> 30:01.349
If you want,
I can give her your message.

30:01.350 --> 30:03.351
If she doesn't get back to you,

30:03.352 --> 30:05.287
I'll get back to you
in case she doesn't.

30:06.421 --> 30:08.090
Give her my postcards.

30:10.225 --> 30:13.961
Haven't you thought of her
not being here?

30:13.962 --> 30:16.564
No, because it was
actually the plan.

30:16.565 --> 30:18.133
My, you have a plan.

30:19.334 --> 30:20.869
Of course, I have a plan.

30:22.104 --> 30:24.006
What do you think,
that I am insane?

30:25.107 --> 30:27.341
We had a rendezvous here.

30:27.342 --> 30:28.944
I can't fucking believe her.

30:31.914 --> 30:34.116
You can stay in the apartment
if you want.

30:36.518 --> 30:38.586
Oh, wow.

30:38.587 --> 30:40.522
Now I see you knew
I was coming.

30:42.925 --> 30:45.426
But you must have been
very bored to do this.

30:45.427 --> 30:47.195
You've been a fellow.

30:47.196 --> 30:49.864
You know it's not
the most entertaining thing.

30:49.865 --> 30:53.100
Are you finishing your work?
Pfft. Not at all.

30:53.101 --> 30:55.169
I'm a bit lost these days.

30:55.170 --> 30:56.904
Start something new.

30:56.905 --> 30:59.207
Maybe I should.

30:59.208 --> 31:02.243
I was thinking of giving this
as a gift for the Institute.

31:02.244 --> 31:04.478
My postcards? Yes.

31:04.479 --> 31:08.950
But it's supposed to be
something personal from you.

31:08.951 --> 31:10.585
I'd rather you to burn them.

31:10.586 --> 31:12.520
And not give them to Carmen?

31:12.521 --> 31:14.188
No.

31:14.189 --> 31:16.290
Fire suits her better.

31:16.291 --> 31:18.593
Let's do it. Here?

31:18.594 --> 31:19.628
Yes.

31:21.029 --> 31:22.430
Like, now.

31:22.431 --> 31:26.133
I see. You want me expelled.

31:26.134 --> 31:30.038
No, but if you burn them, they become
something more personal to you.

31:31.173 --> 31:33.040
But first
take a picture of that,

31:33.041 --> 31:35.643
and give it to the Institute
as your present.

31:35.644 --> 31:37.913
Yeah. Let's do it.

32:42.110 --> 32:44.145
Hello.

32:44.146 --> 32:46.514
What are you going to do now?

32:46.515 --> 32:48.516
I don't know.
I have to change plans.

32:48.517 --> 32:50.217
You don't like changes?

32:50.218 --> 32:52.987
I usually do,
but this is disappointing.

32:52.988 --> 32:55.356
You can stay here
if you need to.

32:55.357 --> 32:57.491
I don't want to.
I have to keep on moving.

32:57.492 --> 33:00.094
It's really not
a problem for me.

33:00.095 --> 33:01.729
I'm too mad to stay right now.

33:01.730 --> 33:04.265
Maybe we meet in the future.

33:04.266 --> 33:06.968
Oh, it's Lukas. He's coming.

33:06.969 --> 33:08.537
You see, I'd better move.

33:10.739 --> 33:14.542
Wait. I propose you
a new rendezvous.

33:14.543 --> 33:16.210
For who?

33:16.211 --> 33:18.179
The two of us.

33:18.180 --> 33:21.582
So Carmen wouldn't have been
so bad after all.

33:21.583 --> 33:24.385
Coming to Montana, leaving all
your friends and boyfriend behind?

33:24.386 --> 33:25.987
Are you going to be there?

33:25.988 --> 33:29.056
I will, in a month.
You like changes?

33:29.057 --> 33:30.658
Actually, I don't,

33:30.659 --> 33:33.260
but suddenly feel the urge to.

33:33.261 --> 33:36.732
Oh, yeah, just buzz me in. I'll
be in and out in like a minute.

33:38.066 --> 33:39.601
Okay.

33:48.343 --> 33:49.677
Hi, Lukas.

33:49.678 --> 33:51.412
Hey, Danièle. How are you?

33:51.413 --> 33:54.248
I don't know right now.

33:54.249 --> 33:55.483
What's that?

33:55.484 --> 33:58.586
Uh, it's one of the
presents for the wall.

33:58.587 --> 34:00.654
You look sexy in this blue shirt.
Mm-hmm.

34:00.655 --> 34:03.258
Are you coming back?
No, I've had enough of you.

34:07.129 --> 34:08.597
Oh, it's a bit crooked.

34:18.473 --> 34:20.574
Do you like it? Yes.

34:20.574 --> 34:23.277
Actually I like it a lot.

34:23.277 --> 34:24.612
She did a good job.

34:25.714 --> 34:27.616
Let's stop mentioning Carmen.

35:09.362 --> 35:11.237
Could you repeat the exact address?

35:12.112 --> 35:14.945
Of Barbara's house.

35:14.987 --> 35:16.237
4-5.

35:19.820 --> 35:21.070
Okay.

35:21.112 --> 35:22.278
Will you stay long?

35:24.237 --> 35:26.320
I just need to pick up some things.

35:26.362 --> 35:29.695
She invited me to tea
with her wife to say good-bye.

35:29.737 --> 35:31.070
I'll be fast.

35:32.153 --> 35:36.153
I'll go with Leo to pick up
some other stuff.

35:36.195 --> 35:38.945
We'll call when we're near.
How long will you be?

35:38.987 --> 35:40.737
How you long do you think you'll take?

35:41.403 --> 35:43.487
Half an hour, 40 minutes.

35:43.528 --> 35:44.612
Half an hour.

35:45.528 --> 35:47.737
Worst case, you'll wait a bit.

35:47.778 --> 35:50.153
Tell Leo to come up front.

35:50.195 --> 35:51.195
He will.

35:57.195 --> 35:58.737
- Camila?
- Yes.

36:04.112 --> 36:06.653
Are you happy you're going to be a mother?

36:06.695 --> 36:08.903
Of course I'm happy.

36:08.945 --> 36:11.487
Maybe you see the dark side.

36:11.528 --> 36:13.403
But today, I'm happy.

36:13.445 --> 36:14.737
What's the baby's name?

36:14.778 --> 36:16.070
We don't know yet.

36:16.862 --> 36:18.528
I don't want you to leave.

36:18.570 --> 36:22.778
It will go fast. Some distance now
will make us closer later.

36:22.820 --> 36:25.153
- Will you bring that to Gregg?
- I don't know.

36:25.195 --> 36:26.737
- Have you spoken?
- No.

36:26.778 --> 36:29.612
- But he knows you're coming?
- We haven't talk.

36:29.653 --> 36:31.195
- Nothing?
- Uh-huh.

36:31.237 --> 36:33.445
I had no idea things ended so bad.

36:33.487 --> 36:37.028
We didn't end it.
Just froze things until we meet again.

36:37.070 --> 36:39.070
- Nothing since he left?
- Nothing.

36:40.653 --> 36:42.362
How long were you together?

36:43.028 --> 36:45.237
- Six months.
- His entire exchange.

36:45.278 --> 36:47.695
- And they lived together.
- Three months.

36:47.737 --> 36:49.153
No messages?

36:49.195 --> 36:51.653
All writing and no touching
is a bit of a farce.

36:51.695 --> 36:53.820
- You've really thought this out.
- Very much.

36:54.737 --> 36:58.903
You've lived last year
as if you'd never met.

36:58.945 --> 37:01.653
So we pick up from where we left off.

37:01.695 --> 37:04.278
- Back to his last day.
- Something like that.

37:04.320 --> 37:06.862
- He has no idea you are coming?
- No idea.

37:06.903 --> 37:08.570
And everything in between?

37:08.612 --> 37:10.653
It all adds up.

37:10.695 --> 37:14.320
- Haven't you wanted to see him?
- That's why I'm flying tonight.

37:14.362 --> 37:15.862
Have you told Leo?

37:15.903 --> 37:18.945
If Leo knew about Gregg,
we wouldn't have this box.

37:18.987 --> 37:20.778
We're accomplices.

37:20.820 --> 37:23.445
- It's not about you.
- No, it's about Leo.

37:23.487 --> 37:26.445
If someone was betrayed,
it was Gregg not Leo.

37:26.487 --> 37:27.695
That's debatable.

37:28.653 --> 37:31.778
If I think of Leo,
I won't leave, and I have to leave.

37:31.820 --> 37:33.487
You're okay with that?

37:33.528 --> 37:37.362
Gregg is there.
It's harder to avoid him than to see him.

37:37.403 --> 37:38.862
Do you regret leaving?

37:38.903 --> 37:39.945
No.

37:39.987 --> 37:41.320
You might.

37:41.362 --> 37:45.028
You're leaving for this fellowship
in order to see Gregg.

37:45.070 --> 37:50.695
Who knows if you'll find him,
or touch him, as you can touch Leo.

37:50.737 --> 37:55.820
Don't fall into the trap of running away
from the people you love.

37:55.862 --> 37:58.403
Are you trying to tell me you'll miss me?

37:58.445 --> 38:00.278
Maybe, but I'm happy you are going.

38:00.320 --> 38:01.362
I see.

38:01.403 --> 38:04.112
Take this gift to Gregg.

38:04.153 --> 38:05.653
I just finished it.

38:06.362 --> 38:07.487
Pass me the pen.

38:08.153 --> 38:12.487
Gregg, If you are reading this,
it's because we found you.

38:12.528 --> 38:17.528
You know you have our best friend.

38:17.570 --> 38:19.903
- How will you find him?
- He left me his address.

38:19.945 --> 38:22.195
- What if he moved?
- He left me several.

38:22.237 --> 38:23.862
Here's the list of his addresses.

38:23.903 --> 38:26.653
- Did you do the same?
- He has mine already.

38:26.988 --> 38:29.444
"Home, work, bar,
corner, secret."

38:29.445 --> 38:29.691
"Home, work, bar, corner, secret."
- What's ‟secret”? - Maybe the girlfriend's place.

38:29.692 --> 38:31.862
- What's ‟secret”?
- Maybe the girlfriend's place.

38:31.903 --> 38:34.820
I'll leave him my address,
in case he ever returns.

38:36.737 --> 38:38.403
- Is that Leo?
- Yes, at the door.

38:38.445 --> 38:40.362
I got you a gift.

38:40.403 --> 38:41.862
- What?
- Something useful.

38:42.570 --> 38:44.195
So pressure!

38:44.237 --> 38:46.237
- You like these for writing.
- Thanks.

38:46.278 --> 38:49.320
- You'll do fine.
- Send us whatever you write.

38:49.362 --> 38:52.653
On my return,
you'll be Hermia, and you, Helena.

38:52.695 --> 38:54.735
- We'll start working right away.
- That's the plan.

38:54.737 --> 38:56.070
I won't be pregnant anymore.

38:56.112 --> 38:58.445
A shame.
A pregnant Helena wouldn't be great.

38:58.487 --> 39:00.945
- Maybe you'll come back pregnant.
- From my American?

39:00.987 --> 39:02.653
- Why not?
- I am not acting.

39:13.487 --> 39:16.528
Leo needs help. Can you come with us?

39:16.570 --> 39:18.403
I can't, but maybe Lucrecia?

39:18.445 --> 39:19.987
- Lucre, can you?
- Sure.

39:20.028 --> 39:21.195
Thank you.

40:11.860 --> 40:14.161
Hello? Hey, Gregg!

40:14.162 --> 40:15.830
I'm sorry? Gregg?

40:17.799 --> 40:19.601
There's no Gregg here.
I'm sorry.

40:24.672 --> 40:27.040
Hello? Oh, sorry, it's me again.

40:27.041 --> 40:30.545
Do you know a Gregg Collison that
used to live in this apartment?

40:31.813 --> 40:33.981
Uh, I don't think so.

40:33.982 --> 40:35.884
You'll have to talk
to the super.

40:47.829 --> 40:48.962
Yeah?

40:48.963 --> 40:52.166
Can you give me
the super's contact?

40:52.167 --> 40:53.501
Sorry.

40:54.636 --> 40:56.037
Hold on a minute.

41:00.608 --> 41:02.476
Brooklyn Public Library.

41:02.477 --> 41:05.880
Hello, I'm looking for Gregg
Collison, an employee there.

41:07.048 --> 41:08.615
One moment.

41:08.616 --> 41:09.717
Okay, thank you.

41:14.556 --> 41:15.956
Hold please.

41:15.957 --> 41:17.091
Okay.

41:21.029 --> 41:22.963
Brooklyn Public Library.

41:22.964 --> 41:26.134
Oh, hello. I'm looking for Gregg
Collison, an employee there.

41:28.136 --> 41:29.937
He's not coming today.

41:29.938 --> 41:32.974
Okay. Would you give me
his phone number, please?

41:34.476 --> 41:35.876
Do you know him?

41:35.877 --> 41:37.912
Yes. Yes, I'm a friend of his.

41:39.047 --> 41:40.949
Okay, let me check.

41:53.828 --> 41:54.829
Gregg!

41:59.801 --> 42:01.602
Are you in a relationship?

42:01.603 --> 42:03.204
No. You? No.

42:04.906 --> 42:06.874
Let's have a drink for that.

42:06.875 --> 42:09.243
I haven't been to this bar in some time.
Let's go someplace else.

42:09.244 --> 42:10.811
I have your addresses here.

42:10.812 --> 42:12.213
The next one is "Corner."

42:17.819 --> 42:19.853
Let's go to your house.

42:19.854 --> 42:21.722
Now? Now it's okay.

42:21.723 --> 42:23.023
I guess so.

42:23.024 --> 42:24.291
But what is "Secret"?

42:24.292 --> 42:25.660
What secret?

42:26.928 --> 42:28.696
The fifth address in your book.

42:40.041 --> 42:41.642
How long has it been?

42:41.643 --> 42:43.310
A year?

42:43.311 --> 42:44.745
But let's not catch up.

42:44.746 --> 42:46.847
Yes, there's no need to.

42:46.848 --> 42:48.582
And just pick it up
from where we left it.

42:48.583 --> 42:50.884
As if nothing
has been in between.

42:50.885 --> 42:52.320
Let's plan our future days.

42:53.821 --> 42:55.756
How long will you
be staying here?

42:55.757 --> 42:57.958
As long as you want to.

42:57.959 --> 42:59.560
What about Buenos Aires?

42:59.561 --> 43:02.863
Well, there will be
some paperwork in the middle,

43:02.864 --> 43:04.698
but I could do it.

43:04.699 --> 43:07.267
We could get married. Why not?

43:07.268 --> 43:10.804
We can get marry here
and then in Buenos Aires.

43:10.805 --> 43:12.840
Our friends there
would love to see you.

43:15.777 --> 43:18.145
Here. From Barbara.

43:18.146 --> 43:22.316
"Gregg, if you are reading this,
it's because we found you."

43:22.317 --> 43:25.285
Remember that you have
our best friend with you,

43:25.286 --> 43:28.155
take care of her
and come back together.

43:28.156 --> 43:30.925
"Greetings, Barbara." Thanks.

43:31.993 --> 43:33.627
We could go to Argentina.

43:33.628 --> 43:37.364
Yes. Maybe to a small
village in the mountains.

43:37.365 --> 43:40.834
I think you could find
the work there easily.

43:40.835 --> 43:46.040
You think you want to have kids?
Well, maybe not now, but soon.

43:47.141 --> 43:49.377
It was worth it the wait.
Mm-hmm.

43:50.778 --> 43:52.714
Are you still working
on your films?

44:21.976 --> 44:24.078
Last night,
I dreamt I went South again.

44:25.713 --> 44:28.683
There is the South, our South,
in the sunlight of my dream.

44:32.854 --> 44:34.755
I think of you.

44:34.756 --> 44:37.290
I know we promised we wouldn't
talk about ourselves,

44:37.291 --> 44:39.359
that we wouldn't
look for each other,

44:39.360 --> 44:41.796
and that I probably shouldn't
be telling you this dream.

44:49.704 --> 44:51.906
I trust this letter
may help us meet again.

44:59.080 --> 45:02.215
You came out blonde and taller.

45:02.216 --> 45:06.320
You didn't look like yourself, but it felt
as warm and alive as you that last time.

45:08.990 --> 45:11.725
Did you turn 27 already?

45:11.726 --> 45:14.195
Vital changes come after
that number, you know.

45:18.966 --> 45:21.702
The South may not
be ours anymore,

45:21.703 --> 45:24.105
but we shouldn't let distance
triumph in the end.

45:31.279 --> 45:33.313
I thought I lost you,

45:33.314 --> 45:36.718
but you reappeared in a brief
gesture just before you stood up.

45:37.919 --> 45:39.387
And I lost you again.

45:41.923 --> 45:44.124
Are you enjoying life?

45:44.125 --> 45:46.093
Do you think of me?

45:46.094 --> 45:48.429
Do you remember
my hands and kissing?

45:54.268 --> 45:59.039
When I think of the South in
my waking hours, I am not sad.

45:59.040 --> 46:03.043
I think of what might have been
if I could have stayed there

46:03.044 --> 46:05.813
and of what the future could be
if you ever read this letter.

46:09.884 --> 46:11.952
Who is that man you follow?

46:11.953 --> 46:14.087
This seems like another you...

46:14.088 --> 46:17.390
hearing a call
but not finding anybody.

46:17.391 --> 46:22.162
Then, like in all dreams, I turn again,
and there you are, safe and glowing,

46:22.163 --> 46:24.265
as though we'd departed
only yesterday.

46:29.937 --> 46:32.439
All this I thought in my dream,

46:32.440 --> 46:35.275
while you stood there,
defiant before me,

46:35.276 --> 46:37.912
for like most sleepers,
I knew that I dreamed.

46:40.081 --> 46:44.885
And in reality, I lay many thousand
miles away in an alien land,

46:44.886 --> 46:48.054
awake in my cramped,
overcharged room,

46:48.055 --> 46:50.390
bewildered at a red moon,

46:50.391 --> 46:54.862
a dark cold sky so different from
the soft sunlight of my dream.

47:40.842 --> 47:44.378
On the ground, sleep sound.

47:46.113 --> 47:50.450
I'll apply to your eyes,
gentle, lover...

47:50.451 --> 47:51.986
remedy.

47:53.354 --> 47:56.990
Squeezes flower juice
into Lysander's eyes.

47:56.991 --> 47:59.111
On the ground, sleep sound.

47:59.112 --> 47:59.227
On the ground, sleep sound. I'll apply
to your eyes, gentle, lover, remedy.

47:59.228 --> 48:03.028
I'll apply to your eyes,
gentle, lover, remedy.

48:49.510 --> 48:55.348
When thou wakest, thou takest.

48:55.349 --> 48:59.419
True delight in the sight

48:59.420 --> 49:03.224
of thy former lady's eye.

49:18.339 --> 49:19.472
- Hey.
- Hey.

49:19.473 --> 49:21.441
How are you? Good. And you?

49:21.442 --> 49:23.410
I'm fine. Can you buzz me in?

49:23.411 --> 49:25.245
Where are you? At your door.

49:25.246 --> 49:29.182
Oh, I'm not there yet.
No. No, please, stay there.

49:29.183 --> 49:31.051
I have something
very important to tell you.

49:31.052 --> 49:32.285
Now? Yes.

49:32.286 --> 49:34.521
Where are you?
Oh, I'm in the park,

49:34.522 --> 49:37.257
but I can take a taxi and be there
in 15 minutes. Okay, I'll wait.

49:37.258 --> 49:39.359
Okay. Bye. See you.

49:39.360 --> 49:43.263
Is everything okay? Oh, Gregg,
just look where we are.

49:43.264 --> 49:44.497
We can go to my place now.

49:44.498 --> 49:46.633
No, we shouldn't
see each other again.

49:46.634 --> 49:50.503
I have lied to you. And I'm
sure you have lied to me.

49:50.504 --> 49:54.407
And I do know I lie to myself.
Should you lie to yourself too?

49:54.408 --> 49:57.544
I know I like to be with you.
No, we deserve better.

49:57.545 --> 50:00.214
And something better is
waiting for me at home now.

50:03.284 --> 50:06.219
Keep it. I didn't even
have time to read it.

50:06.220 --> 50:09.422
You're leaving? You'll get by.
You did all this time.

50:09.423 --> 50:12.258
I thought of you.
You could have looked for me.

50:12.259 --> 50:15.028
Let's meet tomorrow.
I won't feel different.

50:15.029 --> 50:18.031
Go back to sleep and believe this
to have been just a dream. No.

50:18.032 --> 50:20.033
Close your eyes. No.

50:20.034 --> 50:21.167
Close them. No.

50:21.168 --> 50:22.202
Close. No.

50:22.203 --> 50:23.703
Close.

50:23.704 --> 50:27.008
Sleep.

50:28.309 --> 50:30.244
I cannot explain, but run.

50:54.702 --> 50:57.104
There. It's your present
for the institute.

51:43.278 --> 51:45.612
Is your sister still living
in the same house?

51:46.320 --> 51:47.653
Yes, she hasn't moved.

51:48.278 --> 51:52.612
I took a couple of wrong turns,
but I think I know where I am.

51:53.695 --> 51:56.820
- Should I let her know?
- Yes.

51:56.862 --> 51:59.237
- Don't touch the floor.
- Careful.

51:59.278 --> 52:02.237
- Where's Carmen?
- Hi.

52:02.278 --> 52:03.945
One block away.

52:03.987 --> 52:06.612
- Got the keys?
- Yes.

52:32.862 --> 52:35.070
- What are you doing?
- Have they finished?

52:35.112 --> 52:36.612
There's still the basket.

52:36.653 --> 52:38.362
I didn't know you had this here.

52:38.403 --> 52:39.612
Can I take?

52:39.653 --> 52:41.112
Take whatever you want.

52:42.903 --> 52:44.278
Take one of me.

52:44.320 --> 52:46.445
I'll take this one.

52:46.487 --> 52:50.070
I found a very funny letter
that you wrote to Mom.

52:50.112 --> 52:51.445
For friendship day.

52:52.278 --> 52:54.112
"Truly, I'm not your friend.

52:54.153 --> 52:56.570
I think I am much more than a friend.

52:56.612 --> 52:58.278
Am I right or not?

52:58.320 --> 53:00.112
- Bye, love.”
- "Bye, love.”

53:01.153 --> 53:02.778
How dreadful all those hearts.

53:02.820 --> 53:04.778
Rather serious and violent.

53:04.820 --> 53:07.778
Look. The cousins.

53:07.820 --> 53:09.403
Cute.

53:09.445 --> 53:11.945
- Did you call them?
- No, I had no time.

53:11.987 --> 53:14.195
- Call them.
- Yes, I will.

53:15.195 --> 53:16.695
I remember this summer.

53:16.737 --> 53:19.028
- I wrote to Horacio.
- What Horacio?

53:19.070 --> 53:20.070
Horace.

53:20.903 --> 53:23.903
- What did you write?
- That I would be there for a few months.

53:23.945 --> 53:25.028
Just that?

53:25.070 --> 53:28.278
And that if he would like to see me,
that we could meet.

53:28.320 --> 53:30.195
- So?
- He answered back.

53:30.612 --> 53:31.653
Weird.

53:31.695 --> 53:34.570
I wrote to him a few months ago,
and he wrote back a few days ago.

53:35.612 --> 53:37.695
He thought I was already there.

53:37.737 --> 53:39.778
- Does he know about Mom?
- Yes, I told him.

53:40.612 --> 53:43.945
- You think it's wrong.
- I guess not. Do as you like.

53:43.987 --> 53:49.695
- I'm not so sure.
- I don't know if it's necessary.

53:49.737 --> 53:50.820
It seems so.

53:51.778 --> 53:54.987
Imagine that you have your child
without Sergio,

53:55.028 --> 53:57.278
who doesn't want to be part of it
and never will.

53:57.320 --> 54:01.445
You dedicate your life to that child.
You get married. You have other children.

54:01.487 --> 54:04.487
And one day you die
and that child is left alone.

54:04.528 --> 54:07.403
- With his brothers and stepfather.
- So, you would mind.

54:07.445 --> 54:09.570
I'd be dead. I wouldn't care.

54:09.612 --> 54:11.195
Do it and that's it.

54:11.237 --> 54:14.653
I know he's only Mom's lover.

54:14.695 --> 54:17.112
Do you really want to meet
her lover from 30 years ago?

54:17.153 --> 54:20.195
- From whom I took his name.
- So, he gave you his name.

54:20.237 --> 54:21.987
- How did you find him?
- Google.

54:22.945 --> 54:25.153
He's an accountant. He has an office.

54:25.195 --> 54:27.987
- You saw a picture of him?
- No, too many appeared.

54:28.028 --> 54:31.028
I couldn't associate
any face to him or me.

54:31.070 --> 54:33.070
- And this?
- Take him this one.

54:33.112 --> 54:33.945
Nice.

54:35.653 --> 54:38.278
- I have a gift for you.
- What?

54:41.903 --> 54:43.903
They won't have these flowers there.

54:44.612 --> 54:47.278
- Plant it on my delivery day.
- In this?

54:47.320 --> 54:50.737
Take what your sister gives you.

54:50.778 --> 54:52.737
I already closed my suitcase.

54:52.778 --> 54:54.737
Open it. Don't be a pain.

54:54.778 --> 54:57.195
I also brought you something.
For the child.

54:57.237 --> 54:59.320
- Open it the day she is born.
- Good.

55:00.737 --> 55:03.862
- Do you see him as a father?
- A young one.

55:03.903 --> 55:06.487
- I still don't, but I like him.
- Here he comes.

55:06.528 --> 55:08.445
- I have some money for you.
- Thank you.

55:08.487 --> 55:10.278
- What's up?
- Nothing.

55:10.320 --> 55:13.028
- Leo invited us to dinner.
- Let's go.

55:13.945 --> 55:15.528
- And you?
- On the plane.

55:15.570 --> 55:17.528
But come and help me with the last things.

55:21.195 --> 55:22.653
Have you seen Leo?

55:23.320 --> 55:25.362
Yes, I saw him just the other day.

55:26.112 --> 55:27.570
How was he?

55:27.612 --> 55:30.570
He seemed well.
You aren't talking anymore?

55:30.612 --> 55:33.403
- No, we're not.
- Ah.

55:33.445 --> 55:35.278
What was he doing?

55:35.320 --> 55:38.820
He was visiting Mariana
and was leaving to work.

55:38.862 --> 55:41.195
It was very brief.

55:41.237 --> 55:43.987
Uh-huh. Will you see Mariana again?

55:45.445 --> 55:47.960
Yes, maybe next week.

55:47.961 --> 55:48.320
Oh. Yes, maybe next week.

55:48.321 --> 55:49.396
Oh.

55:50.403 --> 55:56.278
Okay,
tell her that I'll meet Horace tomorrow.

55:58.903 --> 56:03.153
Tomorrow I'll call her and let her know.

56:03.195 --> 56:06.778
Perfect. I haven't been able
to get in touch with her.

56:07.820 --> 56:10.987
She might be tired.

56:11.028 --> 56:13.153
I imagine so.

56:13.195 --> 56:16.862
And Lukas? How is he doing?

56:18.237 --> 56:20.862
He's okay. He's there at the Institute.

56:20.903 --> 56:25.362
Yes, I know, but... how's he doing?

56:25.403 --> 56:27.445
I don't see him much.

56:28.362 --> 56:32.903
Um,
I saw him a lot during the first weeks.

56:32.945 --> 56:35.153
Now I'm not going there much.

56:35.195 --> 56:36.987
I am working at home more.

56:37.028 --> 56:40.278
In fact, I'm doing pretty well,
I think I'll come back soon.

56:41.070 --> 56:43.403
- Really? That's great!
- Yes.

56:44.403 --> 56:49.487
Send him a kiss from me. Send him a kiss
and tell him I hope he's well.

56:51.278 --> 56:52.737
Yes, I think he's fine.

56:58.132 --> 57:00.433
- Hey.
- Oh, hey.

57:00.434 --> 57:02.402
Dave, Camila. Camila, Dave.

57:02.403 --> 57:04.971
Oh, hello. Hey.

57:04.972 --> 57:07.006
How are you? Good morning.
Nice to meet you. Hey.

57:07.007 --> 57:09.876
Thank you very much for the ride.
No problem.

57:09.877 --> 57:12.845
It's going to be long? If we
leave now, it'll be two hours.

57:12.846 --> 57:14.814
Okay, great. So we leave.

57:14.815 --> 57:16.817
All right, cool. I'll get the car.
Okay.

57:22.923 --> 57:24.858
So I'll see you in a few days.
Okay.

59:14.101 --> 59:16.537
Okay, thank you for the ride.

59:17.671 --> 59:19.306
So, you're sure it's that way?

59:22.242 --> 59:23.911
Like straight here.

59:24.978 --> 59:26.313
Bye.

01:00:36.049 --> 01:00:37.784
Hello?

01:01:01.074 --> 01:01:03.910
Oh, hello, Horace. It's Camila.

01:01:04.745 --> 01:01:06.946
Camila, how are you?

01:01:06.947 --> 01:01:10.249
I'm waiting for you
at your house.

01:01:10.250 --> 01:01:12.985
You're at my house?
Didn't you get my e-mail?

01:01:12.986 --> 01:01:14.787
What e-mail?

01:01:14.788 --> 01:01:16.989
I sent you an e-mail
two days ago

01:01:16.990 --> 01:01:20.660
saying that I could meet you in New York
today, that I was coming in anyway.

01:01:20.661 --> 01:01:22.395
No, I haven't read it.
You didn't get it?

01:01:22.396 --> 01:01:26.265
No, I am at your house.
I'm so sorry.

01:01:26.266 --> 01:01:31.237
Um, all right, I'm in my car. I can
turn around and be there in two hours.

01:01:31.238 --> 01:01:33.773
Are you...
Are you outside the house now?

01:01:33.774 --> 01:01:35.675
Yes, I am.

01:01:35.676 --> 01:01:39.211
Okay, there's a shed
next to the house.

01:01:39.212 --> 01:01:42.682
Yeah. And the shed has a door
on it with horse painted on it.

01:01:42.683 --> 01:01:44.950
Inside that door...
Yeah, I see it.

01:01:44.951 --> 01:01:46.753
Can you see it? Yeah.

01:05:01.548 --> 01:05:04.650
I'm doing a translation
of a theater play.

01:05:04.651 --> 01:05:06.952
Like, I do theater
back in Buenos Aires.

01:05:06.953 --> 01:05:09.255
I think I didn't tell you.
I don't think you told me.

01:05:09.256 --> 01:05:12.157
Well...
Yeah, so, I'm translating it,

01:05:12.158 --> 01:05:14.994
and the idea is to go back to
Buenos Aires and start rehearsing.

01:05:14.995 --> 01:05:17.897
Which play is it?
Like, Midsummer's Night Dream.

01:05:17.898 --> 01:05:19.665
Midsummer's Night Dream.
That the one you know.

01:05:19.666 --> 01:05:21.333
Yeah.

01:05:21.334 --> 01:05:25.971
And so, it's going good.
I'm happy.

01:05:25.972 --> 01:05:28.207
And how long will you be here?

01:05:28.208 --> 01:05:30.609
Like, it depends.
Like, it's not so clear.

01:05:30.610 --> 01:05:34.546
Like, I think that as soon as
I finish it, I can go back.

01:05:34.547 --> 01:05:40.019
Like... But now they offer me, like... like
an extension, like, in Montana, but...

01:05:40.020 --> 01:05:42.187
In Montana?
Yeah. Have you been there?

01:05:42.188 --> 01:05:45.491
No, I haven't been to Montana,
but that's where they...

01:05:45.492 --> 01:05:48.928
I don't know. Like, they have... Yes,
they have, like, another building there.

01:05:48.929 --> 01:05:52.631
So you can go and just spend,
I don't know, a month,

01:05:52.632 --> 01:05:56.201
uh, in nature and... Yeah.

01:05:56.202 --> 01:05:59.438
But, I don't know, I don't know much about
it, and I'm not sure about doing it.

01:05:59.439 --> 01:06:03.008
Like, actually, I think
I will not do it. I don't know.

01:06:03.009 --> 01:06:04.244
Yeah.

01:06:08.548 --> 01:06:10.650
Here. This is me.

01:06:11.985 --> 01:06:13.153
Thank you.

01:06:14.354 --> 01:06:16.088
Is that you...

01:06:16.089 --> 01:06:19.391
I'm this one with a dove, and
this is my sister Mariana.

01:06:19.392 --> 01:06:22.127
Oh. And that's not anyone...

01:06:22.128 --> 01:06:24.029
No. I have no idea who she is.

01:06:24.030 --> 01:06:27.366
I thought it was you for a second.
Thank you very much. You're welcome.

01:06:27.367 --> 01:06:30.270
Maybe I can find a photo for you.
Hang on a second. Okay. Yeah.

01:06:46.252 --> 01:06:49.755
I hope you don't mind
I made some questions for you.

01:06:49.756 --> 01:06:52.658
What questions? Like, some
things I want to ask you.

01:06:52.659 --> 01:06:54.760
Like, it's not serious.
Just, like, a reminder.

01:06:54.761 --> 01:06:57.096
Yeah. Sure. Yeah.

01:06:57.097 --> 01:06:59.698
Can I make some questions
for you too?

01:06:59.699 --> 01:07:01.467
Yes, of course. Okay. Here.

01:07:01.468 --> 01:07:04.503
This is a photo of me
from long ago.

01:07:04.504 --> 01:07:07.072
This is you? That's me.

01:07:07.073 --> 01:07:10.476
And you are singing and
playing the guitar. Yeah.

01:07:10.477 --> 01:07:12.479
This is a great picture.
Thank you.

01:07:21.588 --> 01:07:23.490
Don't look. Okay.

01:07:32.665 --> 01:07:35.334
How should we do it?

01:07:35.335 --> 01:07:37.569
Let's take turns.

01:07:37.570 --> 01:07:40.339
You go first. Okay. Okay.

01:07:40.340 --> 01:07:43.409
Okay, a simple one.
How old are you?

01:07:43.410 --> 01:07:45.711
Fifty-nine.

01:07:45.712 --> 01:07:50.516
Uh, do you have children? I don't
know anything at all about you.

01:07:50.517 --> 01:07:52.218
No, I don't.

01:07:54.788 --> 01:07:59.792
Um... my second is,
do I have brothers or sisters?

01:07:59.793 --> 01:08:02.294
Yes. Your mother
never told you that?

01:08:02.295 --> 01:08:04.229
You have a sister
who's older than you.

01:08:04.230 --> 01:08:07.699
She was born before Melbourne.

01:08:07.700 --> 01:08:10.536
What's her name?
Her name is Alicia.

01:08:10.537 --> 01:08:15.741
She lives in Cleveland right now. She's got
a job, um, with the Philharmonic there.

01:08:15.742 --> 01:08:17.509
She's a musician.

01:08:17.510 --> 01:08:19.112
Okay.

01:08:20.279 --> 01:08:21.548
Um...

01:08:22.816 --> 01:08:25.651
do you have a husband
or a serious boyfriend?

01:08:25.652 --> 01:08:27.287
Is that two questions?

01:08:29.122 --> 01:08:32.691
Well, that's a complicated
situation, I'd say.

01:08:32.692 --> 01:08:34.828
Hmm. That's not even an answer.

01:08:36.662 --> 01:08:38.698
Let's keep it like this. Yeah.
That's all I get?

01:08:40.166 --> 01:08:41.600
And that is me.

01:08:41.600 --> 01:08:45.337
Um, do you believe in genetics?

01:08:45.337 --> 01:08:49.475
Genetics? Well, I mean,
I believe in them.

01:08:49.475 --> 01:08:51.643
I don't... I don't...

01:08:51.644 --> 01:08:58.584
I think that genetics exist and
environmental influences exist.

01:08:58.585 --> 01:09:02.121
Don't you believe in genetics? Wait. I
don't want that to be one of my questions.

01:09:02.122 --> 01:09:05.724
I mean, like... I mean, like,
if you believe that, um,

01:09:05.725 --> 01:09:09.728
genetics are ruling things,
like, for example, um...

01:09:09.729 --> 01:09:13.433
I don't think they're the only thing that
rules things, but I think they're a factor.

01:09:14.734 --> 01:09:16.667
Okay. My turn.

01:09:16.669 --> 01:09:18.437
Mm-hmm.

01:09:18.438 --> 01:09:21.540
How did your mother die? Cancer.

01:09:21.541 --> 01:09:23.709
Mm, wait, don't take your turn.

01:09:23.710 --> 01:09:26.345
Let me take another one
and then you can have two.

01:09:26.345 --> 01:09:27.578
Okay.

01:09:27.580 --> 01:09:29.448
Did she have a happy life
before she died?

01:09:32.218 --> 01:09:33.586
I think so, yes.

01:09:35.220 --> 01:09:38.191
Did you have any contact
with my mother after Melbourne?

01:09:40.193 --> 01:09:43.729
Um... only once.

01:09:43.729 --> 01:09:47.633
We were...
We had kind of decided

01:09:47.634 --> 01:09:50.803
not to be to... to...

01:09:52.305 --> 01:09:53.906
to be much
into each other's lives.

01:09:53.907 --> 01:09:56.876
But she called me to tell me
that you were born.

01:09:58.178 --> 01:09:59.811
And we talked about it...
Mm-hmm.

01:09:59.812 --> 01:10:02.448
And we didn't decide...

01:10:03.683 --> 01:10:05.817
completely that we
wouldn't talk after that,

01:10:05.818 --> 01:10:08.954
but somehow it never... it
never happened after that.

01:10:08.955 --> 01:10:12.791
It was just a very complicated
situation. Mm-hmm.

01:10:12.792 --> 01:10:14.927
And how was this conversation?

01:10:14.928 --> 01:10:18.463
Like, more contractual
or, like...

01:10:18.464 --> 01:10:21.234
It was... It was calm.

01:10:22.302 --> 01:10:23.903
It was... It was...

01:10:25.872 --> 01:10:30.342
I don't know... I don't know if I behaved
perfectly in this conversation.

01:10:30.343 --> 01:10:31.778
But it was a calm...

01:10:34.314 --> 01:10:36.648
Maybe a little
too business-like.

01:10:36.649 --> 01:10:41.453
I now wish
it was more than it was.

01:10:41.454 --> 01:10:47.392
But it was a very difficult
thing to deal with quickly.

01:10:47.393 --> 01:10:49.929
Yeah. Yeah, I can imagine that.

01:10:51.764 --> 01:10:53.333
Um...

01:10:54.801 --> 01:10:56.735
do you have tattoos?

01:10:56.736 --> 01:11:02.408
Right here in my shoulder, A small
one, black, no colors. Okay.

01:11:04.444 --> 01:11:06.712
Uh, are you married?

01:11:06.713 --> 01:11:09.781
I am not married, no. I was
married for a long time.

01:11:09.782 --> 01:11:13.352
I've been divorced
for five years.

01:11:13.353 --> 01:11:16.622
Is the woman in one of the pictures
there in your living room?

01:11:16.623 --> 01:11:19.425
Yeah, one of the pictures
is of her.

01:11:20.593 --> 01:11:22.728
This is a silly question.

01:11:22.729 --> 01:11:25.631
Do you know who Hal Roach is?

01:11:25.632 --> 01:11:27.766
No, I don't.

01:11:27.767 --> 01:11:31.837
I just asked that because your mother
knew who Hal Roach was very well.

01:11:31.838 --> 01:11:35.440
Okay. She didn't tell me.

01:11:35.441 --> 01:11:40.980
Um, have you told someone
about me along these years?

01:11:42.849 --> 01:11:48.687
No, I don't think I ever
did tell anyone about you.

01:11:48.688 --> 01:11:50.990
I can't...
I don't think I ever did.

01:11:53.459 --> 01:11:54.861
Okay.

01:11:59.032 --> 01:12:00.799
Are you close to your sister?

01:12:00.800 --> 01:12:02.468
Very close.

01:12:03.836 --> 01:12:08.374
Um, have you thought that
I was going to look for you?

01:12:10.510 --> 01:12:15.080
I didn't have any idea that
you even knew that I existed.

01:12:15.081 --> 01:12:20.419
I had the sense that your mother
wasn't even going to talk about me.

01:12:20.420 --> 01:12:22.621
So...

01:12:22.622 --> 01:12:27.359
I guess I didn't think that you
would look for me because of that.

01:12:27.360 --> 01:12:30.496
Mm-hmm. Okay.

01:12:32.732 --> 01:12:34.867
My last question.

01:12:36.069 --> 01:12:39.939
Um, what are
your ambitions in life?

01:12:41.708 --> 01:12:43.509
What do you mean
with ambitions?

01:12:49.916 --> 01:12:52.418
The bathroom is right behind you.
Mm-hmm.

01:12:53.486 --> 01:12:54.921
And this is your room.

01:12:57.023 --> 01:12:59.392
I left towels and blankets
here for you.

01:13:00.426 --> 01:13:02.527
What time?

01:13:02.528 --> 01:13:05.130
There's nothing to get up for tomorrow,
so just sleep in as long as you want to.

01:13:05.131 --> 01:13:06.532
Okay. Thank you very much.
Okay?

01:13:09.237 --> 01:13:10.987
Hi, Mariana.

01:13:11.028 --> 01:13:13.528
Carmen told me the baby was born.

01:13:14.528 --> 01:13:15.612
Beautiful.

01:13:16.403 --> 01:13:20.695
I tried to call but the phone was off.

01:13:21.320 --> 01:13:27.820
It rang but you must be out of reach.

01:13:32.112 --> 01:13:34.153
So, I am at Horace's.

01:13:35.320 --> 01:13:37.945
Actually, in a room next to Horace's.

01:13:41.278 --> 01:13:44.403
It was okay. I liked him.

01:13:47.737 --> 01:13:53.903
Well, I'll call you back.
Tomorrow morning.

01:13:55.028 --> 01:13:57.403
Send me a photo of the baby.

01:13:57.445 --> 01:14:00.028
And send Sergio a big hug.

01:14:00.070 --> 01:14:01.737
You must be really happy.

01:14:03.528 --> 01:14:04.945
I love you.

01:14:05.737 --> 01:14:06.945
Bye.

01:14:39.692 --> 01:14:41.494
Thank you. You're welcome.

01:14:48.234 --> 01:14:51.203
I think I will take
the eleven o'clock train.

01:14:51.204 --> 01:14:52.938
Okay. Mm-hmm.

01:14:52.939 --> 01:14:55.574
Do you want me
to give you a ride?

01:14:55.575 --> 01:14:57.909
How far is the station
from here?

01:14:57.910 --> 01:15:02.581
Um, it's right to the end of the road
and to the right. It's about 500 yards.

01:15:02.582 --> 01:15:07.185
I don't understand. A yard's like, a
meter... little bit less than a meter.

01:15:07.186 --> 01:15:09.154
So that's, like,
half a kilometer.

01:15:09.155 --> 01:15:12.123
Oh, okay. So I think I will walk.
Don't worry.

01:15:12.124 --> 01:15:13.559
Okay.

01:15:21.067 --> 01:15:22.734
Okay. Bye.

01:15:22.735 --> 01:15:24.203
Bye. Thank you.

01:15:34.881 --> 01:15:36.515
Camila. Yeah?

01:15:36.516 --> 01:15:39.217
The train station's that way.
Oh, okay.

01:15:39.218 --> 01:15:41.119
Bye. I'm coming to New
York next weekend.

01:15:41.120 --> 01:15:43.722
If you're around, maybe we can have
a meal or coffee or something.

01:15:43.723 --> 01:15:45.057
That would be great.

01:15:53.666 --> 01:15:57.636
The train is currently
ten minutes behind schedule.

01:15:57.637 --> 01:15:59.170
That's ten minutes
behind schedule.

01:15:59.171 --> 01:16:03.876
Train 283, scheduled for 2:00
heading northbound.

01:16:12.285 --> 01:16:17.690
Train 560, scheduled for 3:00,
southbound to New York City station.

01:16:51.057 --> 01:16:54.659
Camila, hello. This is Danièle.

01:16:54.660 --> 01:16:59.297
I'm back in Montana.
Um, are you around?

01:16:59.298 --> 01:17:01.100
I think you should come.

01:17:18.718 --> 01:17:20.252
Hey.

01:17:33.399 --> 01:17:36.801
I'm sure I can find something for you.
I could continue teaching.

01:17:36.802 --> 01:17:39.371
Even something
at the Institute.

01:17:39.372 --> 01:17:41.906
I think I would like
to see Horace again.

01:17:41.907 --> 01:17:44.976
Do you want me to go with you?
We'll see. Don't worry.

01:17:44.977 --> 01:17:47.012
How far is Montana?
It's pretty far.

01:17:47.013 --> 01:17:49.180
But at least
in the same country.

01:17:49.181 --> 01:17:52.951
Yeah, but it'd be easier just to go to Buenos Aires.
As Carmen once told you.

01:17:52.952 --> 01:17:54.420
Carmen, if she only knew.

01:17:56.956 --> 01:18:00.125
So, let's do that. You'd save on
paperwork and I could use a change.

01:18:00.126 --> 01:18:02.994
Just like this? Just like that.

01:18:02.995 --> 01:18:04.963
You finished your translation?
No, not yet.

01:18:04.964 --> 01:18:07.400
All right, so finish that
and let's move on. Okay.

01:18:23.737 --> 01:18:24.987
Here we are.

01:18:25.028 --> 01:18:26.695
- How did the truck behave?
- Well.

01:18:35.653 --> 01:18:36.820
Coming down?

01:19:34.612 --> 01:19:37.070
- I'll plug it here.
- Fine.

01:20:38.195 --> 01:20:39.320
Did you cry?

01:20:39.862 --> 01:20:43.612
- What did you do when you left?
- I took a taxi. Alone.

01:20:43.653 --> 01:20:45.112
Very professional.

01:20:46.862 --> 01:20:48.070
Did you go to the door?

01:20:48.112 --> 01:20:51.445
Yes, door, police, passport.
Some people leave, others stay.

01:20:51.487 --> 01:20:53.070
You'll have to go visit.

01:20:53.862 --> 01:20:54.987
I don't know.

01:20:55.028 --> 01:20:58.028
It'll be fine.
You always knew she would leave.

01:20:58.070 --> 01:21:00.862
- But she kept postponing it.
- Maybe you liked that.

01:21:02.320 --> 01:21:04.070
I think it was bad timing.

01:21:04.112 --> 01:21:05.695
In what sense?

01:21:05.737 --> 01:21:08.237
She should have left before or after.

01:21:08.278 --> 01:21:11.320
Not just as our relationship
was getting serious.

01:21:11.945 --> 01:21:13.987
Earlier, we never would've met.

01:21:14.028 --> 01:21:17.612
Later, would be the same.

01:21:18.320 --> 01:21:21.362
Would you have preferred
to break-up in the middle?

01:21:21.403 --> 01:21:22.737
No.

01:21:22.778 --> 01:21:25.320
But it's true. She didn't want to leave.

01:21:25.362 --> 01:21:27.070
I also had that feeling.

01:21:27.737 --> 01:21:31.320
On our way to the airport,
she looked at me strangely.

01:21:31.362 --> 01:21:33.737
Don't worry. Time flies.

01:21:35.070 --> 01:21:36.695
She might even come back earlier.

01:21:38.903 --> 01:21:41.987
I thought she would stay
and have dinner with us.

01:21:42.028 --> 01:21:44.445
Well, life is disappointing.

01:21:44.487 --> 01:21:47.195
Indeed, it is. Why those gloves?

01:21:47.237 --> 01:21:48.862
They were on the ground.

01:21:48.903 --> 01:21:51.570
- Aren't they yours?
- Yes.

01:21:52.362 --> 01:21:54.153
Mail them to her.

01:21:54.195 --> 01:21:55.778
She'll get others there.

01:21:55.820 --> 01:21:57.403
Or next time you meet.

01:21:57.445 --> 01:22:00.070
Next time I'll be more of
an uncle than a boyfriend.

01:22:00.112 --> 01:22:02.653
- But she'll be back.
- And the same as today.

01:22:02.695 --> 01:22:05.487
- You think so?
- Yes, don't you?

01:22:05.528 --> 01:22:06.987
No, I don't think so.

01:22:07.028 --> 01:22:08.445
We'll see.
