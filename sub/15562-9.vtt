00:13.112 --> 00:14.913
I hate Black Friday.

00:14.914 --> 00:16.914

00:21.899 --> 00:23.265
Here we go.

00:23.267 --> 00:27.669
This is the Super Bowl of retail.

00:27.671 --> 00:29.704
There's a buzz in the air,

00:29.706 --> 00:33.375
a charge that probably
doesn't read on camera.

00:33.377 --> 00:37.179
Uh, but over here we have
the pre-opening potluck.

00:37.181 --> 00:39.714
Every employee brings a dish,

00:39.716 --> 00:41.850
much in the spirit of sharing.

00:41.852 --> 00:43.652
Isn't that a delightful tradition, Amy?

00:43.654 --> 00:45.220
Yeah, I love waking up at 3:00 a.m.

00:45.222 --> 00:47.856
to eat Sandra's cold spinach casserole.

00:47.858 --> 00:50.158
- It's meant to be served cold.
- Sorry.

00:50.160 --> 00:51.626
Okay, Garrett,

00:51.628 --> 00:54.262
any advice for my first Black Friday?

00:54.264 --> 00:55.697
Get that camera out my face.

00:55.699 --> 00:57.699
All right, not a morning person.

00:57.701 --> 00:59.000
Cheyenne, how about you?

00:59.002 --> 01:00.068
How're you feeling?

01:00.070 --> 01:01.036
I'm okay.

01:01.038 --> 01:02.938
I think I hit something with my car,

01:02.940 --> 01:04.806
but I was too tired to check.

01:04.808 --> 01:06.024
Well, that's alarming.

01:06.025 --> 01:07.870
Okay, attention, everyone.

01:07.918 --> 01:11.220
Black Friday is the most
important day of the year.

01:11.335 --> 01:12.330
And the key to getting through it

01:12.333 --> 01:13.993
is to stay calm.

01:14.294 --> 01:15.299
No matter what happens,

01:15.302 --> 01:18.203
I am gonna stay Obama cool.

01:18.205 --> 01:21.406
Okay, Chris, we all know
how you feel about Obama.

01:21.408 --> 01:23.709
You can stay George W. Bush cool.

01:23.711 --> 01:27.146
Remember how calm he was on 9/11?

01:27.148 --> 01:29.248
Well, not that this is gonna be 9/11.

01:29.250 --> 01:31.672
This is gonna be better than 9/11.

01:31.762 --> 01:33.896
No, why do I keep saying 9/11?

01:33.898 --> 01:35.631
What's 9/11?

01:35.633 --> 01:36.799
You didn't hear?

01:36.801 --> 01:38.434
All right, everybody, focus up.

01:38.436 --> 01:40.169
Today, you need to
prepare for the worst.

01:40.171 --> 01:42.905
If you find yourself in a
jam, remember the word ACT:

01:42.907 --> 01:45.407
Assess, Communicate, Take Action.

01:45.409 --> 01:47.409
ASSESS: Assess the situation.

01:47.411 --> 01:49.611
COMMUNICATE: Communicate.

01:49.613 --> 01:52.247
TAKE ACTION: Take action.

01:52.249 --> 01:53.615
I don't really need to explain it.

01:53.617 --> 01:55.117
- Amy?
- Thank you, Deen.

01:55.119 --> 01:58.354
All right, I want a minimum
of five employees in each zone,

01:58.356 --> 01:59.785
eight in Electronics,

01:59.786 --> 02:01.390
obviously in rolling,
two-person pigeon teams.

02:01.392 --> 02:03.592
All RMDs need to have the right CPOs.

02:03.594 --> 02:06.362
We'll assimilate any dead stock
for TKTs at the end of the day.

02:06.364 --> 02:07.796
- Got it? 
- ALL: Got it.

02:07.798 --> 02:10.366
Jonah, can you please be in
charge of tracking the UPTs

02:10.368 --> 02:11.600
and logging them in the T7?

02:11.602 --> 02:13.202
Yes, I certainly can.

02:13.204 --> 02:14.970
I just made that up.
You're on spills and trash.

02:14.972 --> 02:16.672
- Cool.
- Okay, break.

02:22.346 --> 02:25.047
You can do this. You can do this.

02:28.085 --> 02:29.618
Black Friday? What?

02:29.620 --> 02:31.153
Not afraid of you.

02:40.431 --> 02:43.165
Please, everybody keep back and in line.

02:43.167 --> 02:44.666
It's a fire hazard.

02:44.668 --> 02:47.836
Also, if anyone finds a
green hair thingy, it's mine.

02:47.838 --> 02:49.972
I dropped it on the way in.

02:49.974 --> 02:52.708
- Green hair thingy.
- Super cute.

02:52.710 --> 02:54.076
Hey, any way you guys could set aside

02:54.078 --> 02:56.011
one of those 60-inch
flat-screens for me?

02:56.013 --> 02:57.679
Um, do you see this?

02:57.681 --> 02:58.714
It's called a line.

02:58.716 --> 03:00.182
So no, I can't.

03:00.184 --> 03:01.650
I'll give you 40 bucks.

03:01.652 --> 03:03.152
It wouldn't be fair.

03:03.154 --> 03:05.020
Each.

03:05.022 --> 03:06.955
Oh...

03:08.324 --> 03:10.993
Hey, Tate, how's it going?

03:10.995 --> 03:12.461
- It's going fantastic.
- Great.

03:12.463 --> 03:13.762
Nobody gets their prescriptions filled

03:13.764 --> 03:16.482
on Black Friday, so I
got all the time I want

03:16.483 --> 03:17.599
to work on my screenplay.

03:17.601 --> 03:19.168
- Oh.
- It's about a pharmacist,

03:19.170 --> 03:21.136
obviously, who invents a pill

03:21.138 --> 03:23.539
that allows you to
use all of your brain.

03:23.541 --> 03:24.706
Oh, like "Limitless."

03:24.708 --> 03:26.041
Not like "Limitless"! All right.

03:26.043 --> 03:28.277
Why do people keep saying
it's like "Limitless"?

03:28.279 --> 03:31.547
It's inspired by "Limitless."

03:31.549 --> 03:33.224
Okay, uh, quick question.

03:33.225 --> 03:35.525
Um, I'm trying to stay relaxed today,

03:35.527 --> 03:37.761
so Jerusha gave me these pills

03:37.763 --> 03:39.696
that she got after her train accident.

03:39.698 --> 03:42.832
I just want to make
sure I won't get hooked.

03:42.834 --> 03:44.334
Alprazolam,

03:44.336 --> 03:47.070
Good, good times.

03:47.072 --> 03:49.072
Yeah, it's a low dose.
You should be okay.

03:49.074 --> 03:50.340
Oh, okay.

03:50.342 --> 03:51.374
Have you had anything to drink today?

03:51.376 --> 03:53.276
Uh, just three mugs of juice.

03:53.278 --> 03:54.277
I think you'll be fine.

03:54.279 --> 03:55.545
Okay.

03:57.815 --> 03:59.916
No, I lied. It was seven mugs.

03:59.918 --> 04:01.952
I just didn't want you to judge me.

04:01.954 --> 04:03.787
That's too much juice, Glenn.

04:07.825 --> 04:09.159
Pretend I'm not here.

04:09.161 --> 04:12.128
Why pretend when you could
really just not be here?

04:12.130 --> 04:15.198
You know, everybody here is so jaded.

04:15.200 --> 04:17.000
This is exciting! This is fun.

04:17.002 --> 04:18.635
This is, like, the
closest our country has

04:18.637 --> 04:20.536
to the running with
the bulls in Pamplona.

04:20.539 --> 04:22.572
- Ugh.
- Okay, I'll shut up, sorry.

04:22.574 --> 04:26.109
Wow, I just got really
nauseous all of a sudden.

04:26.110 --> 04:27.294
Nauseated.

04:27.295 --> 04:29.032
I'm so sorry. That's,
like, a reflex a mine.

04:29.033 --> 04:30.198
I'm working on it.

04:30.200 --> 04:31.566
It's weird. I never get sick.

04:31.568 --> 04:32.834
It's like when...

04:35.405 --> 04:37.339
Finish this.

04:37.341 --> 04:38.373
Okay.

04:41.177 --> 04:42.778
Mm-hmm...

04:42.780 --> 04:44.313
mm-hmm.

04:44.315 --> 04:46.181
No, I don't know for sure.

04:46.183 --> 04:47.883
I'm just saying that I might be.

04:47.885 --> 04:52.087
Yes, we did, in the photo
lab at work, remember?

04:52.089 --> 04:54.556
Who cares who initiated it, Adam?

04:54.558 --> 04:56.558
Wow.

04:56.560 --> 04:58.560
All right, everybody, get ready.

04:58.562 --> 05:01.163
Store is set to open
in exactly one minute.

05:01.165 --> 05:03.465
60, 59...

05:03.467 --> 05:05.167
You don't have to say all the numbers.

05:05.169 --> 05:07.636
60, 61...

05:07.638 --> 05:08.637
yeah, that's right.

05:08.639 --> 05:09.604
I'm going up now.

05:09.606 --> 05:10.739
Okay, uh, one last thought

05:10.741 --> 05:11.707
before we open

05:11.709 --> 05:13.408
that if you apply...

05:15.846 --> 05:17.379
Whoa, whoa.

05:19.082 --> 05:21.583
Yes, you can get
pregnant from that angle.

05:23.920 --> 05:26.221
You can get pregnant from any angle.

05:26.223 --> 05:27.356
What?

05:27.358 --> 05:29.057
No, I can't... I can't hear you.

05:29.059 --> 05:30.058
Ow!

05:32.962 --> 05:34.196
If I could just get everybody describing

05:34.198 --> 05:35.597
what Black Friday means to them,

05:35.599 --> 05:36.732
that would be gr...

05:36.734 --> 05:39.534
Hey, that's a new camera.

05:39.536 --> 05:41.436
Attention, Cloud 9 shoppers.

05:41.438 --> 05:43.839
Apparently Black Friday has begun.

05:43.841 --> 05:45.774
From all of us here at Cloud 9,

05:45.776 --> 05:47.542
have a great Purge.

05:56.555 --> 05:59.055
Okay, well, we're, uh,
only five minutes in,

05:59.057 --> 06:01.391
and already the, uh, beer tower display

06:01.393 --> 06:03.159
got knocked over onto Miles,

06:03.161 --> 06:06.996
so he's gone, and aisle 12 is
covered with blood and glass.

06:06.998 --> 06:09.632
But, uh, it's all... it's all good, boo.

06:09.634 --> 06:11.134
I'm keeping it 100.

06:11.136 --> 06:12.702
- That's not what that means.
- No?

06:12.704 --> 06:14.971
Um, Glenn, I'm feeling
a little bit sick.

06:14.973 --> 06:17.207
No, Amy, do not fall apart on me, okay?

06:17.209 --> 06:19.008
You just need to stay calm.

06:19.010 --> 06:20.843
- I need to go.
- What?

06:26.584 --> 06:27.951
Attention, shoppers.

06:27.953 --> 06:30.253
Cloud 9 brand tablets are half off.

06:30.255 --> 06:32.288
The Halo Fog has an HD display

06:32.290 --> 06:35.358
and boasts a battery
life of about 45 minutes.

06:35.708 --> 06:36.874
Hey, I need you to work the register

06:36.876 --> 06:38.175
while Tim's in the bathroom.

06:38.177 --> 06:39.356
Nah, I don't do registers.

06:39.357 --> 06:41.090
Look, I know that it's
really the hip thing

06:41.092 --> 06:42.725
for you millennials
to not give a crap...

06:42.727 --> 06:45.459
That's not true, and we're the same age,

06:45.460 --> 06:46.529
but please, go on.

06:46.531 --> 06:47.530
It's all hands on deck,

06:47.532 --> 06:48.531
so quit your Myspacing

06:48.533 --> 06:49.632
and get on the register.

06:49.634 --> 06:51.233
That's an order.

06:51.235 --> 06:52.768
All right.

06:52.770 --> 06:54.370
Let me just finish this announcement.

06:54.372 --> 06:55.638
Fine, but the second you're done,

06:55.640 --> 06:57.239
I want you on register three.

06:57.241 --> 06:59.675
The second I'm done.

06:59.677 --> 07:01.644
You can also view thousands of movies

07:01.646 --> 07:03.412
on the Halo Fog.

07:03.414 --> 07:04.780
I will now list some of the movies

07:04.782 --> 07:06.248
that are probably on there.

07:06.250 --> 07:09.985
"Mrs. Doubtfire,"
"Silence of the Lambs,"

07:09.987 --> 07:12.321
that one where Nicolas
Cage switches faces

07:12.323 --> 07:14.390
and says he's gonna
eat a peach for hours...

07:14.392 --> 07:15.491
ooh, "Forrest Gump."

07:15.493 --> 07:16.859
That's a good movie.

07:16.861 --> 07:19.895
Excuse me, do you have any more of
these espresso makers in the back?

07:19.897 --> 07:22.631
I think so, yeah.

07:22.633 --> 07:24.600
Okay, could you get me one?

07:24.602 --> 07:27.303
It's all the way in the back.

07:27.305 --> 07:30.372
Yeah, a lot of people
need stuff right now.

07:30.374 --> 07:31.974
How do we decide who to help first?

07:31.976 --> 07:33.476
Is it you? Is it them?

07:33.478 --> 07:35.377
You, them?

07:35.379 --> 07:36.445
You?

07:40.317 --> 07:41.851
Ew, no.

07:41.853 --> 07:42.918
I want a bribe.

07:44.354 --> 07:46.121
Oh, God.

07:46.123 --> 07:47.857
- Hey, Tate.
- What?

07:47.859 --> 07:50.726
Um, do you have any extra
pregnancy tests back here?

07:50.728 --> 07:52.361
Of course. Why do you need them?

07:54.130 --> 07:56.198
Oh.

07:58.301 --> 07:59.869
Mm-mm-mm!

07:59.871 --> 08:01.971
Someone's a dirty bird.

08:01.973 --> 08:04.139
Didn't think you had it in you.

08:04.141 --> 08:07.838
Oh, no, I mean, I wouldn't call
myself a filmmaker, like, capital F.

08:07.839 --> 08:08.977
Oh, is this for you?

08:08.978 --> 08:10.344
We'll see how it all
cuts together in the end.

08:10.346 --> 08:12.379
Extra dirty for a naughty little girl.

08:12.381 --> 08:15.249
Okay, you pervert, just
give me the pregnancy test!

08:16.693 --> 08:18.094
No, this wasn't... Oh, II was just...

08:18.096 --> 08:19.929
- I had to keep...
- I didn't...

08:23.200 --> 08:25.534
Sucks we lost the Rams, huh?

08:26.603 --> 08:28.070
Oh, I'm looking for a little girl.

08:28.072 --> 08:29.705
She has a big bow in her hair.

08:29.707 --> 08:31.407
She's carrying a Baby Fashion Girl.

08:31.409 --> 08:33.308
Okay, relax, we're gonna find her.

08:33.311 --> 08:35.977
The important thing to
do, though, is stay calm.

08:35.980 --> 08:39.148
And see? There she is, doing fine.

08:39.150 --> 08:40.515
It's all good.

08:40.518 --> 08:41.616
Thank God.

08:41.619 --> 08:43.385
Trevor, we got a Baby Fashion Girl!

08:50.260 --> 08:53.062
And then Jenny dies

08:53.064 --> 08:55.331
of what is implied to be AIDS.

08:55.333 --> 08:56.465
But we don't know.

08:56.467 --> 08:58.868
And he puts Haley Joel Osment on a bus,

08:58.870 --> 08:59.902
and guess what?

08:59.904 --> 09:01.804
Same bus driver from the beginning.

09:01.806 --> 09:03.072
What are you still doing here?

09:03.074 --> 09:04.440
You're supposed to be on the register.

09:04.442 --> 09:05.808
You said I could
finish the announcement.

09:05.810 --> 09:07.043
Yeah, that was ten minutes ago.

09:07.045 --> 09:09.311
It's a very long announcement.

09:09.313 --> 09:11.347
Next up, "Apollo 13."

09:11.349 --> 09:12.682
I see what you're doing here.

09:12.684 --> 09:15.151
In this film, Tom Hanks is a spaceman

09:15.153 --> 09:17.620
whose life is saved by a bunch of nerds.

09:21.758 --> 09:23.659
Were you just waiting for me?

09:23.661 --> 09:25.361
N-no, I didn't even know you were...

09:25.363 --> 09:26.896
I was just checking out the fliers here.

09:26.898 --> 09:28.998
Sal's looking for a
roommate, so that's, uh...

09:29.000 --> 09:30.199
It's negative.

09:30.201 --> 09:32.268
I am not pregnant.

09:32.270 --> 09:35.337
Oh, I'm so sorry...

09:35.339 --> 09:36.472
or happy for you.

09:36.474 --> 09:39.642
I don't... whatever
applies to your... you.

09:39.644 --> 09:41.043
Well, it's complicated,

09:41.045 --> 09:43.345
'cause, you know, at first
I was really panicked,

09:43.347 --> 09:45.114
and, I don't know, I started
having other feelings...

09:45.116 --> 09:47.316
- Oh, God,
- And I'm just trying to...

09:47.318 --> 09:49.618
Okay, dick, sorry I'm boring you.

09:49.620 --> 09:51.153
No, no, it's not...

09:51.155 --> 09:52.855
I... I just suddenly...

09:58.228 --> 09:59.328
Out of my way, Rodriguez.

09:59.330 --> 10:00.396
Oh.

10:08.088 --> 10:10.154
Okay, everyone, here's the sitch:

10:10.155 --> 10:12.518
It appears that everyone in the store

10:12.519 --> 10:14.958
got very ill from food poisoning,

10:14.960 --> 10:16.693
probably from our potluck.

10:16.695 --> 10:18.762
Oh well, sacré bleu.

10:18.764 --> 10:20.653
You know, stuff happens.

10:20.654 --> 10:22.321
As you can see, though, I am, uh...

10:22.323 --> 10:23.989
I am staying very calm.

10:23.991 --> 10:25.090
I took a pill.

10:25.092 --> 10:27.079
I don't think it did anything, though.

10:28.027 --> 10:29.962
Oh, I like this store.

10:29.964 --> 10:31.363
I just wanna go home.

10:31.365 --> 10:32.498
I can't do this.

10:32.500 --> 10:34.266
I'm one of those people
who hates being sick.

10:34.268 --> 10:35.601
Hot take, Mateo.

10:35.603 --> 10:37.669
All right, we've lost half our staff.

10:37.671 --> 10:39.037
We are what's left.

10:39.039 --> 10:41.140
Sandra, you're off of go-backs.

10:41.142 --> 10:42.708
I need you to cross-check Housewares.

10:42.710 --> 10:43.909
Heather and Brett,

10:43.911 --> 10:45.878
you guys are on opposite
puking cycles, right?

10:45.880 --> 10:47.479
So you can switch off.

10:47.481 --> 10:50.215
And, um, Myrtle, I'm gonna
need you to start folding,

10:50.217 --> 10:52.484
like, 1,000 times faster.

10:52.486 --> 10:55.521
You got it. Full steam ahead!

11:05.932 --> 11:08.367
And then there's the one where Tom Hanks

11:08.369 --> 11:10.302
is in the airport the whole time.

11:10.304 --> 11:12.371
Honestly, I checked out on that one.

11:12.373 --> 11:14.773
Anybody see "Sully"?

11:14.775 --> 11:16.175
I didn't.

11:16.177 --> 11:17.543
Ugh, I don't feel so hot.

11:17.545 --> 11:18.973
I got to take a break, y'all.

11:21.064 --> 11:21.480
Oh.

11:21.482 --> 11:22.815
If you're done with the announcement,

11:22.817 --> 11:24.016
register three could use a hand.

11:24.018 --> 11:26.585
See? I don't give up.

11:26.587 --> 11:29.021
Neither do I.

11:31.024 --> 11:33.125
Don't forget about "Polar Express."

11:33.127 --> 11:34.593
Merry Christmas, kids.

11:34.595 --> 11:35.794
It's a nightmare.

11:40.033 --> 11:42.134
Excuse me.

11:51.211 --> 11:53.145
Amy, uh, I need your key

11:53.147 --> 11:54.479
to the razor case.

11:54.481 --> 11:55.881
Yeah, okay, just give me a sec.

11:55.883 --> 11:58.217
I'm in... Bedding.

11:58.219 --> 12:00.752
Roger.

12:00.754 --> 12:02.254
Amy?

12:02.256 --> 12:04.523
Jonah?

12:04.525 --> 12:06.258
Hey.

12:06.260 --> 12:09.528
Yeah, the line in the ladies'
room was really long, so...

12:09.530 --> 12:10.562
Got it. No, no, no.

12:10.564 --> 12:14.099
Please, uh, make your... self at home.

12:15.068 --> 12:16.835
Thanks.

12:16.837 --> 12:20.571
Hey, uh, you know why
they call it Black Friday?

12:20.591 --> 12:22.173
We really don't have
to make conversation.

12:22.174 --> 12:23.273
Okay, okay, cool.

12:23.274 --> 12:24.307
- We can just...
- Yep.

12:24.309 --> 12:26.542
- Be quiet.
- Okay.

12:26.544 --> 12:27.543
That's fine.

12:27.545 --> 12:29.021
Total silence.

12:33.017 --> 12:35.484
And then the volleyball floats away.

12:35.486 --> 12:37.420
And weirdly, you're sad about it.

12:37.422 --> 12:38.888
At least I was.

12:38.890 --> 12:40.523
Oh.

12:40.525 --> 12:42.858
I feel like my insides are
crawling through my skin.

12:42.860 --> 12:44.126
Can I have a sip of that?

12:44.128 --> 12:45.728
Sure.

12:45.730 --> 12:47.063
20 bucks.

12:47.065 --> 12:48.264
For a sip of Pepto?

12:48.266 --> 12:49.932
I'll just go buy my own.

12:49.934 --> 12:53.736
You know, I think someone
already bought them all.

12:53.738 --> 12:55.037
Hm. Well, well, well.

12:55.039 --> 12:56.706
Who's all grown up?

12:56.708 --> 12:58.107
It's called war profiteering.

12:58.109 --> 13:00.276
I learned about it in Social Studies.

13:09.386 --> 13:12.421
I'm relieved, by the way,
about not being pregnant.

13:12.423 --> 13:15.191
- Oh.
- You were asking earlier, so...

13:15.193 --> 13:17.326
Oh, oh, uh, good.

13:17.328 --> 13:19.128
Yeah, no, I... I don't blame you.

13:19.130 --> 13:22.198
That's... one child is... is enough.

13:22.200 --> 13:25.067
I've always thought I
wanted, like, two or three.

13:26.336 --> 13:27.436
Oh.

13:27.438 --> 13:29.972
Yeah, I mean, I think maybe I still do,

13:29.974 --> 13:33.142
just not with...

13:33.144 --> 13:35.011
with, you know, everything

13:35.013 --> 13:37.346
that's going on in the world, and...

13:38.648 --> 13:40.249
Yeah, it's, uh...

13:40.251 --> 13:41.717
it's complicated times.

13:41.719 --> 13:43.252
So complicated.

13:45.055 --> 13:46.522
I-I don't mean to rush you,

13:46.524 --> 13:49.792
but you see yourself
being done anytime soon?

13:49.794 --> 13:51.460
No, I'm waiting for you to be done.

13:51.462 --> 13:52.628
Well, that's unfortunate,

13:52.630 --> 13:54.463
because I was waiting for you, so...

13:54.465 --> 13:55.631
God.

13:55.633 --> 13:57.333
"Da Vinci Code," too long.

13:57.335 --> 13:59.201
"Bridge of Spies," too boring.

14:00.737 --> 14:02.705
I can't do this anymore.

14:02.707 --> 14:03.939
E-readers are half price.

14:03.941 --> 14:05.741
Garrett out.

14:09.046 --> 14:11.047
Stop it!

14:13.683 --> 14:17.420
This is the dark night of our souls...

14:17.422 --> 14:19.188
a portrait of hopelessness.

14:19.190 --> 14:20.189
A...

14:22.293 --> 14:23.926
Wow, we've lost Brett.

14:23.928 --> 14:25.795
Okay, guys, I know we're bare bones,

14:25.797 --> 14:27.263
but we can still make this work.

14:27.265 --> 14:30.599
If Sandra could triple-cover
Camping, Menswear,

14:30.601 --> 14:32.501
and Softlines... Sandra,
you can do that, right?

14:32.503 --> 14:33.969
I guess if my knees were normal,

14:33.971 --> 14:35.771
but three different doctors said...

14:35.773 --> 14:38.374
Oh, so we're all back here, huh?

14:38.376 --> 14:39.675
We're just taking a little break.

14:39.677 --> 14:41.077
We'll get out there in a sec.

14:41.079 --> 14:43.946
- It's fine.
- Are you not feeling sick?

14:43.948 --> 14:45.381
Oh, no, I feel terrible.

14:45.383 --> 14:47.249
Worst I've ever felt.

14:47.251 --> 14:48.884
Hey, if we're all back here,

14:48.886 --> 14:50.419
who's watching the floor?

14:52.155 --> 14:53.322
Whoa. Hold on, man.

14:53.324 --> 14:55.524
Hold on, man. Wait. You
got to stand in line.

15:00.330 --> 15:02.231
Form an orderly line.

15:02.233 --> 15:04.166
Hey, one TV per family.

15:04.168 --> 15:06.569
Listen, lady, I'm putting
your face in my memory palace.

15:06.571 --> 15:09.171
Eyes too far apart, stringy hair.

15:09.173 --> 15:10.673
Ethnic nose.

15:10.675 --> 15:12.875
This isn't over!

15:12.877 --> 15:14.310
Oh, it's over.

15:14.312 --> 15:17.613
Oh, and then we just need
Herman to cover everything.

15:17.615 --> 15:19.115
Herman hasn't worked here in six months.

15:19.117 --> 15:20.182
Fine, then, you know what?

15:20.184 --> 15:21.650
I don't know how to make this work.

15:21.652 --> 15:23.018
If it makes you feel any better,

15:23.020 --> 15:24.720
this is probably all your fault.

15:24.722 --> 15:26.989
That stuffing you made
tasted like burnt hair.

15:26.991 --> 15:29.458
My stuffing is not what made us sick.

15:29.460 --> 15:32.962
If anything, it was probably
Dina's weird tofu turkey thing.

15:32.964 --> 15:34.096
You know what's weird?

15:34.098 --> 15:35.564
Eating the flesh off of a bird's bones,

15:35.566 --> 15:36.389
you savage.

15:36.390 --> 15:37.588
Why are you so weird?

15:37.591 --> 15:39.491
Why is everyone being
so mean to each other?

15:39.493 --> 15:40.592
Guys...

15:42.596 --> 15:44.997
- Okay, Amy, now is not...
- Guys!

15:44.999 --> 15:46.966
This is what Black Friday wants!

15:46.968 --> 15:48.634
That is a family recipe

15:48.636 --> 15:50.202
with a secret ingredient.

15:50.204 --> 15:53.372
But this is not what
Black Friday is gonna get!

15:53.374 --> 15:55.407
Oh, cinnamon? Boring.

15:55.409 --> 15:57.042
And we are gonna overcome this,

15:57.044 --> 15:58.644
- because there is abso...
- Jonah?

15:58.646 --> 16:01.213
Could you please shut the [Bleep] up?

16:01.215 --> 16:03.248
And that goes for all of you [Bleep].

16:03.250 --> 16:05.084
I can't listen to your [Bleep]

16:05.086 --> 16:09.755
For one more [Bleep]damn [Bleep] second.

16:13.460 --> 16:15.828
Did something just happen?

16:15.830 --> 16:17.529
I think I blacked out there.

16:20.194 --> 16:21.993
I have a terrible headache, Mateo.

16:21.995 --> 16:23.970
Can you please barf quieter?

16:23.971 --> 16:25.826
Ugh, could you be a bitch quieter?

16:25.873 --> 16:29.241
Okay, I called Corporate
to ask for help,

16:29.243 --> 16:31.643
and turns out they're closed today

16:31.645 --> 16:32.945
'cause it's a holiday.

16:33.622 --> 16:35.080
So what do we do?

16:35.082 --> 16:36.181
I say we bail.

16:36.183 --> 16:37.583
Okay.

16:37.585 --> 16:38.717
Wait, what? Really?

16:38.719 --> 16:41.053
Yeah, even if everyone
in here felt great,

16:41.055 --> 16:43.622
we still don't have enough
people to cover the floor.

16:43.624 --> 16:47.559
So we just abandon the store?

16:47.561 --> 16:48.727
Black Friday broke us.

16:48.729 --> 16:50.929
All right, I'm calling it.

16:50.931 --> 16:53.298
Time of death, 11:13 p.m.

16:53.300 --> 16:54.867
Just let it all burn.

16:56.103 --> 16:57.903
Wait, we're just gonna leave?

16:57.905 --> 16:59.671
It was your idea to bail.

16:59.673 --> 17:01.607
Yeah, I suggest that every Friday.

17:01.609 --> 17:03.609
Even you, Dina? You
said you'd never give up.

17:03.611 --> 17:05.978
I also said I'd never
vomit on a toddler's head.

17:05.980 --> 17:07.579
Lot of firsts today.

17:12.652 --> 17:13.952
Hold up. Wait.

17:15.622 --> 17:19.023
Yo, I don't like working here.

17:19.026 --> 17:20.259
Okay.

17:20.261 --> 17:22.528
But it's my job.

17:22.530 --> 17:23.829
I do the bare minimum,

17:23.830 --> 17:25.631
but I don't do less than that.

17:25.633 --> 17:28.667
And I'm not about to let a
bunch of deal-hungry rubes

17:28.669 --> 17:31.637
trash our store and make
me feel bad for Dina,

17:31.639 --> 17:33.705
which I did not think was possible.

17:33.707 --> 17:35.908
So I'ma get out there,
and I'ma finish my shift.

17:35.910 --> 17:38.644
And yeah, I'ma cut corners,

17:38.646 --> 17:39.978
and I'ma phone it in,

17:39.980 --> 17:42.848
but it'll never be said
that Garrett McNeill

17:42.850 --> 17:44.283
did not do just enough

17:44.285 --> 17:45.984
to not get fired.

18:01.701 --> 18:03.735
Move it!

18:11.645 --> 18:13.779
Open.

18:27.661 --> 18:29.588
Aisle seven. 30 days. Home and Garden.

18:29.589 --> 18:30.922
Dairy factory-farmed.

18:30.924 --> 18:32.056
We don't sell wigs anymore.

18:32.058 --> 18:32.990
That's not your color.

18:38.385 --> 18:40.360
Heather, reconfigure the LPOs,

18:40.361 --> 18:42.150
and then move 'em to the PRC.

18:42.830 --> 18:44.797
Boom.

18:44.799 --> 18:46.632
Henry, get all the UPTs

18:46.634 --> 18:48.033
out of the green zone.

18:48.035 --> 18:49.501
If you run into a jam,

18:49.503 --> 18:52.972
radio a 62V for a DPR, got it?

18:52.974 --> 18:55.374
All right, break!

18:55.376 --> 18:56.642
- Wow.
- Yeah.

18:56.644 --> 18:57.643
That was impressive.

18:57.645 --> 18:59.044
Didn't know I had it in me.

18:59.046 --> 19:00.546
I mean, none of it meant anything,

19:00.548 --> 19:03.115
but the confidence is inspiring.

19:05.386 --> 19:07.419
Have a heavenly day.

19:07.421 --> 19:08.420
Next!

19:08.422 --> 19:11.023
Attention, shoppers,
the store is now closed.

19:11.025 --> 19:12.825
Not, like, "Bring your
items to the front" closed.

19:12.827 --> 19:14.426
I mean, like, "Get the hell out."

19:14.428 --> 19:16.562
Thank you.

19:16.564 --> 19:19.765
Oh, also, if anyone happens to
find a little green hair thing,

19:19.767 --> 19:21.500
it's mine.

19:21.502 --> 19:25.471
Thank you so much for
shopping at Cloud 9.

19:25.473 --> 19:29.541
Oh, sir, you accidentally
drove over my daughter's doll!

19:29.543 --> 19:30.876
Not accidentally.

19:41.822 --> 19:43.922
I hate Black Friday.

19:43.924 --> 19:45.724
I can't move.

19:45.726 --> 19:47.159
Me neither.

19:47.161 --> 19:48.894
Hey, Myrtle.

19:48.896 --> 19:50.562
Myrtle!

19:50.564 --> 19:53.532
Could somebody poke Myrtle
and see if she's still alive?

19:53.534 --> 19:54.933
Does it really matter?

19:54.935 --> 19:57.569
I guess not.

19:57.571 --> 20:00.606
Oof. TGIF, right, guys?

20:03.443 --> 20:04.943
Hey, where's Amy?

20:05.640 --> 20:07.067
Hi, it's me.

20:07.068 --> 20:08.167
Sorry I haven't called all day.

20:08.169 --> 20:09.935
It's been a frickin' zoo here.

20:09.937 --> 20:13.906
Um, I took the test, and don't worry.

20:13.908 --> 20:14.873
I'm not happy.

20:14.875 --> 20:16.709
I mean... pregnant.

20:16.711 --> 20:18.477
I'm not pregnant.

20:22.415 --> 20:25.417
Or... maybe I'm not happy.

20:25.419 --> 20:26.785
I... I don't know.

20:26.787 --> 20:28.921
Um...

20:28.923 --> 20:30.322
Adam, we should talk.

20:38.431 --> 20:40.403
Look who works register after all.

20:40.404 --> 20:41.436
Dina, I can't.

20:41.437 --> 20:42.469
Whatever issue you have with me

20:42.471 --> 20:44.504
can wait till tomorrow, so...

20:55.451 --> 20:57.384
Kind of wish I hadn't
spent the whole day puking.

20:57.386 --> 20:58.819
Yeah, me too.

20:59.202 --> 21:00.735
Find every breath
mint left in the store,

21:00.737 --> 21:02.470
and meet me in the photo lab.

21:02.473 --> 21:05.107
Ten minutes, or I start without you.

21:05.109 --> 21:07.242
A lot of firsts today.

21:08.305 --> 21:14.757
