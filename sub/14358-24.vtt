<i>(Frankie) the end of the
school year--</i>

00:07.382 --> 00:09.516
<i>Finals, parent-teacher
conferences</i>

00:09.551 --> 00:12.086
<i>And that official teenage
popularity meter...</i>

00:12.120 --> 00:13.687
The yearbooks are out!

00:13.721 --> 00:16.522
Oh, wow, honey.
I haven't looked yet.

00:16.556 --> 00:20.058
I ran all the way home so we
could look through it together.

00:20.092 --> 00:22.425
Wanna flip through it with
me and see how many times

00:22.459 --> 00:24.893
I'm in it?
Sure! That's always fun.

00:24.927 --> 00:27.094
<i>That's never fun.</i>

00:27.128 --> 00:30.461
Class officers, no. Clubs, no.

00:30.495 --> 00:32.328
Other clubs, no.

00:32.362 --> 00:34.329
<i>Every year it's the same.</i>

00:34.363 --> 00:36.964
<i>Poor Sue had tried out for God
knows how many things...</i>

00:36.998 --> 00:38.965
(squeak, thud)

00:39.000 --> 00:41.234
<i>(marching band playing)</i>

00:41.268 --> 00:44.069
<i>(thud) and she hadn't
made a single one.</i>

00:44.103 --> 00:48.071
Oh! Maybe I'm in some of the ids
from the lunchroom. Yeah, right.

00:48.106 --> 00:50.672
Oh! I think that
might be my shoe.

00:50.707 --> 00:53.241
Well, at least you
have your class photo.

00:53.276 --> 00:55.543
(turns page)

00:58.979 --> 01:00.446
Wait a minute.

01:00.481 --> 01:02.682
I retook that
picture three times.

01:02.716 --> 01:04.816
I had three photos available!

01:04.851 --> 01:06.418
How did this happen?

01:06.452 --> 01:09.421
This is just not right!

01:09.455 --> 01:10.922
(sighs) that's okay.

01:10.956 --> 01:14.024
I'm pretty sure that one
in the candids is my shoe.

01:14.059 --> 01:17.093
I'll just get everyone to
sign it by my shoe. (sighs)

01:17.127 --> 01:19.996
Yeah. I'm pretty
sure that's my shoe.

01:25.735 --> 01:28.469
It is just heartbreaking.

01:28.503 --> 01:30.938
She's so used to failure,

01:30.972 --> 01:33.273
She doesn't even feel
bad about it anymore.

01:33.307 --> 01:36.109
And you know whose fault that is?
The yearbook committee?

01:36.143 --> 01:38.844
No, Mike. Ours.
Wasn't even my second choice.

01:38.878 --> 01:40.311
We're lazy, Mike.

01:40.346 --> 01:42.813
Oh, no. Not the lazy parent.

01:42.848 --> 01:44.815
We are. We're lazy,
lazy parents.

01:44.849 --> 01:47.817
We just throw 'em out the door
and let 'em fend for themselves.

01:47.852 --> 01:50.053
Wolves take better
care of their young.

01:50.087 --> 01:52.688
So she's an average,
ordinary kid. So what?

01:52.723 --> 01:54.322
Nothing wrong with average.

01:54.357 --> 01:56.224
Ugh. You are so naive.

01:56.258 --> 01:58.826
Average may have been fine
when we were in school,

01:58.860 --> 02:00.661
But it's a new world out there.

02:00.662 --> 02:02.462
Average is the new
below average.

02:02.497 --> 02:05.298
B's are the new C's.
C's are the new d's.

02:05.332 --> 02:07.766
D's are the-- okay, what magazine
or lady show can I blame for this?

02:07.800 --> 02:09.201
Look at this.

02:09.235 --> 02:10.702
All these pages,

02:10.737 --> 02:13.305
Filled with extraordinary kids
doing extraordinary things--

02:13.339 --> 02:14.706
And you know why?

02:14.740 --> 02:17.842
Because they have parents that
get in there and get involved.

02:17.876 --> 02:20.044
Come on. We hate those
parents. (sighs)

02:20.078 --> 02:22.445
We make fun of those parents.

02:22.480 --> 02:24.680
Trust me. We have
nothing to worry about.

02:24.714 --> 02:26.814
Our kids are just fine.

02:26.849 --> 02:28.915
Brick may be not be
moving on to third grade.

02:28.950 --> 02:31.084
What? What--what do you mean,
not moving on to third grade?

02:31.118 --> 02:32.885
He's the smartest
kid in the class.

02:32.919 --> 02:34.987
I mean, I'm sure
you're doing your best,

02:35.021 --> 02:37.722
<i>But... Not a real brain trust here.
Mike.</i>

02:37.756 --> 02:41.291
It's because he hasn't been returning
library books. Are you kidding me?

02:41.326 --> 02:44.060
He's not moving up to third
grade over library books?

02:44.095 --> 02:46.496
That's nuts. The librarian
is invoking statute 482b.

02:46.530 --> 02:48.364
He's gonna have to
resolve it with her.

02:48.398 --> 02:50.600
And please make
sure that he does.

02:50.634 --> 02:52.802
<i>It's been a long year.
(chuckles)</i>

02:52.836 --> 02:55.037
(sighs)

02:55.071 --> 02:57.906
I don't think I have a
Sue heck in my class.

02:57.940 --> 02:59.340
Yes, you do.

02:59.375 --> 03:02.109
We go through this all the time.
You have Sue.

03:02.144 --> 03:04.378
Oh! Here we go. Here's her name.

03:04.412 --> 03:06.980
I just can't Sm to place her face. Does
she have red hair? No, she doesn't.

03:07.015 --> 03:09.549
Blond and sort of
athletic-looking? No.

03:09.583 --> 03:12.818
Is she African-American?
Do we look like she's African-American?

03:12.853 --> 03:15.621
How about I look in the
yearbook to job my memory?

03:15.655 --> 03:17.489
Oh, don't bother.

03:17.524 --> 03:21.193
We just got the results
of axl's aptitude test.

03:21.227 --> 03:22.995
You don't gotta
sugarcoat it. (sighs)

03:23.029 --> 03:25.097
We already had two other
conferences today,

03:25.131 --> 03:27.633
So we're getting pretty used to the
drill. He tested as academically gifted.

03:27.667 --> 03:29.335
Axl is gifted?

03:29.369 --> 03:30.736
Our axl?

03:30.771 --> 03:32.505
You calling my son a cheater?

03:32.539 --> 03:33.873
Oh, no. (chuckles)

03:33.907 --> 03:37.043
Look. He's gifted.
He's brilliant.

03:37.077 --> 03:38.744
(both exhale deeply)

03:38.779 --> 03:40.213
The problem is,

03:40.247 --> 03:42.515
He's performing far
below his potential.

03:42.550 --> 03:45.351
He's getting C's.
Which are the new d's.

03:45.386 --> 03:46.719
It's odd.

03:46.753 --> 03:48.754
We rarely see this kind of gap

03:48.788 --> 03:50.089
Between achievement
and aptitude,

03:50.123 --> 03:51.556
Except in families

03:51.591 --> 03:54.192
Where at least one of the
parents is in prison.

03:57.631 --> 03:58.998
(sighs)

03:59.032 --> 04:01.768
Hey! Mom, look. I'm using
my history book as a plate.

04:01.802 --> 04:03.703
No cleanup for you.
You're welcome.

04:03.738 --> 04:06.339
We got some pretty interesting
news at your conference today.

04:06.373 --> 04:08.441
Apparently, you're smart.

04:08.475 --> 04:10.976
I am? Yeah.
Like, extremely smart.

04:11.010 --> 04:12.878
Wait. You sound mad.

04:12.912 --> 04:15.513
Your tone isn't really matching the
words you're saying. That aptitude test
you took--

04:15.548 --> 04:18.716
Your counselor told us you
scored in the 98th percentile.

04:18.750 --> 04:20.151
Out of how many?

04:20.185 --> 04:22.687
100.

04:22.754 --> 04:24.956
Ha! Told you I was
smarter than you thought.

04:24.990 --> 04:27.725
Good thing you caught me.
I was just about to study.

04:27.760 --> 04:29.927
That would've been a big
waste of time. (chuckles)

04:29.962 --> 04:31.696
No, you're gonna
start getting grades

04:31.730 --> 04:34.031
That reflect you're smart,
so crack a book--

04:34.065 --> 04:36.834
To you, a plate-- get.

04:36.868 --> 04:39.536
We're gonna be expecting a lot
from you from now on. Oh, my God.

04:39.570 --> 04:42.239
You find out I'm really smart,
and you're still on me?

04:42.273 --> 04:45.275
I can't please you people!
Aah! Stupid big brain!

04:47.111 --> 04:48.578
<i>So...</i>

04:48.612 --> 04:51.380
How did I do?
How was my conference?

04:51.415 --> 04:54.216
Oh, honey, so great.

04:54.251 --> 04:57.286
Your teacher didn't have one
bad word to say about you.

04:57.320 --> 04:59.755
Yay! She's my favorite teacher.

05:02.625 --> 05:04.626
Heart... Breaking.

05:04.661 --> 05:06.394
<i>Breaking, Mike!</i>

05:06.429 --> 05:08.363
(sighs) you said, "don't worry."

05:08.397 --> 05:10.832
You said, "oh, the kids Arne."

05:10.866 --> 05:12.333
Only took three conferences

05:12.368 --> 05:14.769
To blow your theory
out of the water.

05:14.803 --> 05:16.538
Well, I'm gonna get in there

05:16.572 --> 05:18.373
And help Sue make her
mark at that school.

05:18.407 --> 05:20.374
I'm gonna be the kind
of parent we hate.

05:20.409 --> 05:21.809
Look.

05:21.843 --> 05:25.112
This is what Sue has
been reduced to.

05:25.147 --> 05:28.416
And you and I both know
that isn't even her shoe.

05:33.672 --> 05:36.174
<i>After we told brick about
his conference,</i>

05:36.207 --> 05:38.608
<i>He agreed to straighten things
out with the librarian,</i>

05:38.643 --> 05:41.044
<i>Mrs. Nethercott, an institution
at Orson elementary.</i>

05:41.078 --> 05:42.545
There you are, dear.

05:42.580 --> 05:44.981
The adventures of Betsy,
tacy and darling little tib.

05:45.015 --> 05:47.416
Oh, I hope you love
them like I do.

05:47.450 --> 05:50.985
Please come back and
tell me what you thought.

05:51.020 --> 05:53.220
Oh, it's you.

05:53.255 --> 05:56.123
Hi, Mrs. Nethercott.
I-is there a problem?

05:56.157 --> 05:59.025
Hmm. Is the a problem?

05:59.059 --> 06:01.927
You know, brick, when you
first came to this school,

06:01.961 --> 06:04.829
I was so excited to
hear about a little boy

06:04.864 --> 06:07.231
Who loved books as much as I do.

06:07.266 --> 06:09.367
It's what a librarian dreams of.

06:09.401 --> 06:11.035
Thank you. Let me finish.

06:11.069 --> 06:13.270
For years I have watched

06:13.304 --> 06:16.273
As you've checked out
book after book after book

06:16.307 --> 06:19.709
And brought them back covered
with syrup and yogurt--

06:19.743 --> 06:23.345
That is, if they even
come back at all.

06:23.379 --> 06:25.747
Look, we can play the
blame game all day.

06:25.781 --> 06:28.115
The point is, I love books.

06:28.150 --> 06:31.518
You say you love books.
I don't think you do.

06:31.553 --> 06:35.255
I love the books in this room
like they're my very own babies.

06:35.289 --> 06:38.190
You have 31 of them out.

06:38.225 --> 06:41.126
31 of my babies.

06:41.160 --> 06:44.028
And I want them back--

06:44.062 --> 06:45.496
All of them--

06:45.530 --> 06:48.465
Or you're not going
into third grade.

06:48.499 --> 06:50.400
Th's right.
No fractions for you.

06:50.434 --> 06:51.867
No cursive.

06:51.902 --> 06:54.603
No, uh, field trip
to an Amish farm.

06:54.637 --> 06:56.604
You think you can make it

06:56.639 --> 06:59.507
Out in the real world
without cursive?

06:59.541 --> 07:00.975
<i>You can't.</i>

07:03.177 --> 07:06.913
<i>Look, you have to accept some
responsibility here.</i>

07:06.947 --> 07:08.414
Shh!

07:08.448 --> 07:13.752
You have until Walt
Whitman's birthday.

07:13.787 --> 07:15.454
Go luck.

07:18.858 --> 07:22.361
Hello, sweetheart. Thank you.

07:22.395 --> 07:24.463
Principal Sholin,

07:24.497 --> 07:27.432
I need to talk to you about
my daughter, Sue heck.

07:27.467 --> 07:30.035
I know, I know.
You don't know who she is.

07:30.069 --> 07:32.436
But trust me,
she's in the seventh grade,

07:32.471 --> 07:34.870
And she is spirited,
and she is awesome,

07:34.904 --> 07:37.171
And it is ridiculous-- no,
tragic, actually--

07:37.205 --> 07:39.606
That she can't be a
part of this school.

07:39.640 --> 07:42.508
Come on. There's only a
week left till summer.

07:42.543 --> 07:45.176
Can't this wait till next year?

07:45.211 --> 07:48.512
No. Why can't there be
some team, some club

07:48.546 --> 07:51.414
That you can get into
just because you showed

07:51.448 --> 07:55.583
Doesn't sound like a very good team.
But it would be,

07:55.618 --> 07:58.486
Because it would be filled
with people who don't give up--

07:58.520 --> 08:01.322
People like my daughter,
who try and fail

08:01.356 --> 08:03.757
And pick themselves
up and keep on going

08:03.792 --> 08:07.227
And stay positive in
the face of all odds.

08:07.261 --> 08:08.995
My God!

08:09.029 --> 08:11.431
Isn't there a place
in this school

08:11.465 --> 08:14.266
For someone like that?

08:14.300 --> 08:15.734
Guess what?

08:15.768 --> 08:18.203
I, uh, happened to run
into your principal today,

08:18.238 --> 08:19.705
And he told me

08:19.740 --> 08:22.141
That they decided
to change the policy

08:22.175 --> 08:24.410
And make cross-country
a no-cut sport.

08:24.444 --> 08:25.879
No-cut?

08:25.913 --> 08:27.380
No cuts, no tryouts.

08:27.414 --> 08:30.316
All you have to do is
show up on Tuesday,

08:30.350 --> 08:33.219
Go around the track a few times,
and you're in!

08:33.253 --> 08:35.220
Oh, my God. Oh, my God!

08:35.255 --> 08:37.422
(laughs) I love cross-country!

08:37.457 --> 08:38.890
That's running, right?

08:38.924 --> 08:41.525
Yeah, running.
All you gotta do is run.

08:41.561 --> 08:44.463
I can run! I ran all the way
home from school yesterday,

08:44.497 --> 08:47.866
And I got here so fast.
Imagine how fast I could go

08:47.901 --> 08:50.302
When I'm not holding
a heavy yearbook. Oh!

08:50.336 --> 08:53.605
Imagine how fast I could go when I
have complete use of my arms! Yeah!

08:53.639 --> 08:55.273
(clatters) I know!

08:55.308 --> 08:57.876
Oh, my God. This is it.

08:57.910 --> 09:00.412
I'm finally gonna
be part of a team.

09:00.446 --> 09:03.615
<i>I know, honey.
We did it! You did it.</i>

09:03.650 --> 09:05.117
Aah! Aah!

09:05.151 --> 09:07.719
(laughing) oh! (laughing) oh!

09:10.770 --> 09:12.671
<i>I was feeling pretty darn good.</i>

09:12.705 --> 09:15.174
<i>The heck family was on
the right track.</i>

09:15.208 --> 09:17.176
<i>Sue was practicing for
cross-country...</i>

09:17.210 --> 09:19.145
<i>Brick was slowly but
surely finding</i>

09:19.179 --> 09:21.513
<i>His lost library books...</i>

09:23.549 --> 09:26.351
<i>And Axl was studying
in his room.</i>

09:27.887 --> 09:30.288
Have you checked on
axl in a while, Mike?

09:30.322 --> 09:32.223
Yeah, yeah. He's doing great.

09:32.257 --> 09:35.626
(electric guitar
blares in distance)

09:35.661 --> 09:37.662
I'll go check on him.

09:37.696 --> 09:39.297
?

09:39.332 --> 09:41.299
What are you doing?

09:41.334 --> 09:44.503
What? I was taking a break. About to
start up again. Put the guitar down.

09:44.537 --> 09:47.606
You're supposed to be studying for your
final. I know, but I don't have any
study skills,

09:47.640 --> 09:50.275
And those are very hard
skills to learn at my age.

09:50.309 --> 09:51.743
My brain's already formed.

09:51.778 --> 09:54.479
Maybe if you'd raised me better-
no more excuses, axl.

09:54.514 --> 09:57.315
Now that we know how smart you are,
we're cracking down. Well, if I'm so
smart,

09:57.350 --> 09:59.518
Then how come nothing's
sticking in my brain? Seriously.

09:59.552 --> 10:02.421
I gave myself the practice
test while I was on the toilet.

10:02.455 --> 10:05.490
<i>I got a "d"-- and that was with
cheating. All right. I taught you how
to burp the alphabet.</i>

10:05.525 --> 10:08.427
I guess I can teach you
how to study. Come on.

10:08.462 --> 10:11.831
<i>And he did--all night long.</i>

10:11.865 --> 10:13.332
(blender whirs)

10:13.366 --> 10:15.801
What is that? Make it stop.

10:15.835 --> 10:17.536
Sorry. (chuckles)

10:17.570 --> 10:19.905
Making a protein shake.
(chuckles)

10:19.939 --> 10:22.641
Sue, it's 5:30.
What are you doing up?

10:22.675 --> 10:24.609
Training. Gotta get
up bright and early

10:24.644 --> 10:27.512
To get a practice run in before
school starts. (chuckles)

10:27.547 --> 10:30.415
Oh! Dad, if anyone calls,
can you tell 'em I'm out running

10:30.449 --> 10:32.183
'cause I'm on cross-country n

10:32.217 --> 10:34.952
And that even though I'll be
super busy with cross-country,

10:34.987 --> 10:36.888
I'll call 'em back,
'cause they're still my friends

10:36.922 --> 10:38.656
Even though I'll probably have

10:38.691 --> 10:40.424
A lot of new cross
country friends,

10:40.459 --> 10:42.360
And they can come to
my cross-country meets,

10:42.394 --> 10:44.329
And we can go out
for pizza after,

10:44.363 --> 10:46.964
But it'll have to be somewhere
near the cross-country track.

10:46.999 --> 10:49.400
I'll just say you're
not here. Okay.

10:49.435 --> 10:51.736
Ah. (inhales and exhales deeply)

10:51.771 --> 10:54.172
Hmm. All right.
I'm gonna hit the showers.

10:54.207 --> 10:57.442
(inhales deeply) mm.

10:57.477 --> 11:00.712
Hey, axl, you should feel good
about the work you did tonight.

11:00.747 --> 11:03.315
I'm proud of you.

11:03.349 --> 11:06.285
<i>Yep, Mike was feeling good.</i>

11:06.319 --> 11:07.753
<i>I was feeling good.</i>

11:07.787 --> 11:10.256
<i>We were opening doors
for our kids</i>

11:10.290 --> 11:12.557
<i>And letting them run free.
(leaves rustle)</i>

11:14.894 --> 11:18.162
(groans) mom!

11:18.197 --> 11:20.298
(gasps)

11:20.333 --> 11:21.800
Sue, what happened?

11:21.834 --> 11:24.235
I got hit by a deer.

11:24.270 --> 11:25.970
You hit a deer?

11:26.004 --> 11:28.405
<i>No. I got hit by a deer.</i>

11:29.841 --> 11:31.876
Ohh.

11:31.910 --> 11:33.310
I don't get it.

11:33.345 --> 11:35.712
How does someone
get it by a deer?

11:35.747 --> 11:38.315
How is that even possible?

11:38.349 --> 11:40.517
You think that's bad?

11:40.551 --> 11:42.452
I graded axl's practice test.

11:42.486 --> 11:44.920
I was up all night
with him studying,

11:44.955 --> 11:47.389
And he got another "d"...
Oh. (sighs)

11:47.457 --> 11:50.358
Which is apparently the new "f." that's
great. We did our part, we got involved,

11:50.392 --> 11:53.294
And it didn't make a damn bit of
difference. You know what? I don't
think it's us.

11:53.328 --> 11:55.796
I don't think we're
lazy parents at all.

11:55.831 --> 11:57.798
I think we're good parents

11:57.832 --> 12:00.300
And that we got stuck
with crappy kids.

12:00.368 --> 12:02.303
That's right.
It's nature versus nurture,

12:02.337 --> 12:05.339
And I-I think more and more
that it's nature. (sighs)

12:05.374 --> 12:08.309
'course, that would sort of be
our fault, too. Hey, stop that.

12:08.343 --> 12:10.744
We're good parents,
Frankie. We are.

12:10.778 --> 12:13.446
Uh, school started
three hours ago.

12:13.481 --> 12:15.949
Are either of you gonna take?

12:17.000 --> 12:23.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

12:26.901 --> 12:28.368
Hi, coach Emerson.

12:28.403 --> 12:29.769
Sorry I'm late.

12:29.804 --> 12:31.771
Chemistry was on
the third floor,

12:31.806 --> 12:34.641
And all those stairs...
Whew! (chuckles)

12:34.675 --> 12:37.676
What are you doing here?
I signed up to be on the team.

12:37.711 --> 12:41.380
I am a fast healer. My Jersey size
is small. What's with the foot?

12:41.415 --> 12:44.216
I got hit by a deer.
(laughs) you hit a deer?

12:44.250 --> 12:46.919
No, I got hit by a deer.
(chuckles)

12:46.953 --> 12:49.388
See, this deer came out
of the woods, and...

12:49.422 --> 12:52.424
Anyway, the doctor said I
should be all good for August

12:52.458 --> 12:53.892
When our season starts.

12:53.926 --> 12:55.327
Sorry.

12:55.361 --> 12:58.329
You're gonna have to make it
around the track five times.

12:58.364 --> 13:00.331
Five times?
But that's impossible.

13:00.365 --> 13:03.300
I'm already a little chafed
and achy under my arms.

13:03.334 --> 13:05.768
Can't I just be on
the team anyway?

13:05.803 --> 13:09.572
My mom said it was no-cut. So you think
you can just show up and not do
anything?

13:09.606 --> 13:13.209
Well, you know what?
If you want to be on my team,

13:13.243 --> 13:16.078
You're gonna have to make it
around the track five times.

13:16.112 --> 13:18.946
Feel free to sign up next year,
if I'm still here.

13:18.981 --> 13:21.081
It was nice to meet you.

13:24.618 --> 13:26.018
(exhales deeply)

13:26.052 --> 13:28.754
(inhales deeply)

13:28.788 --> 13:31.256
I had you for math last year.

13:31.290 --> 13:32.757
Huh?

13:32.792 --> 13:34.659
You didn't just meet me.

13:34.694 --> 13:37.228
I had you for math last year.

13:37.263 --> 13:38.629
I am Sue heck,

13:38.664 --> 13:41.865
And I had you for
math last year!

13:45.036 --> 13:47.537
This one's a little sticky.

13:47.572 --> 13:50.673
Can you prove it wasn't like
that when I checked it out?

13:54.110 --> 13:55.744
(sighs) okay, brick.

13:55.778 --> 13:59.514
Looks like they're all here.
Somehow you managed to do it.

13:59.549 --> 14:02.484
See you in third grade, Mrs.
Nethercott.

14:02.518 --> 14:05.786
Well, well, well.
What have we here?

14:05.821 --> 14:08.856
Seems like we're still
missing one book after all.

14:08.890 --> 14:11.225
This little piggy didn't come home,
did it, brick?

14:11.259 --> 14:15.997
Oh, and it's a big,
expensive reference book.

14:16.031 --> 14:17.565
It's an atlas.

14:17.599 --> 14:21.101
But I already searched
my entire house.

14:21.135 --> 14:23.002
Well, where could it be?

14:23.036 --> 14:26.671
If only you had a
map to find it.

14:27.739 --> 14:29.173
You have until

14:29.207 --> 14:32.575
Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's
birthday to get it here,

14:32.610 --> 14:36.646
Otherwise,
see you in second grade.

14:36.680 --> 14:39.715
(whispers) second grade.

14:45.955 --> 14:48.424
Have you guys seen
a book this big?

14:48.458 --> 14:51.794
How would you even get a book
that big home? I don't know.

14:51.828 --> 14:54.830
Did I even bring it home?
I have no idea!

14:54.864 --> 14:56.965
Now are you gonna help me,

14:57.033 --> 14:58.967
Or AI gonna repeat
second grade? (sighs)

14:59.002 --> 15:01.970
Hey, how'd the test go?
I either rocked it or failed it.

15:02.005 --> 15:04.639
Or... Somewhere in the middle.
I can't tell anymore.

15:04.674 --> 15:07.976
What do you mean, you can't tell?
I just can't tell, okay?

15:08.010 --> 15:11.512
Now that I know I'm a genius,
there's just so much pressure!

15:11.580 --> 15:13.414
You studied for one night.

15:13.448 --> 15:15.916
People burn out. It happens.
This kid who sits behind me,

15:15.950 --> 15:18.385
He used to do really well on
those aptitude test things,

15:18.419 --> 15:20.720
But he totally crapped out
this year. He was crying.

15:20.754 --> 15:23.956
His parents came in, and they were
crying. So the kid who sits behind you

15:23.990 --> 15:25.791
Used to do well on
the aptitude test

15:25.825 --> 15:28.794
But then suddenly did bad on it? Yeah,
this smart kid, an heung,

15:28.828 --> 15:31.663
And he was on this track to
do all these advanced classes,

15:31.697 --> 15:35.234
But... So the kid who sits
behind you is named Alan heung,

15:35.268 --> 15:38.303
And he used to do well,
but he bombed out,

15:38.337 --> 15:40.205
And you usually bomb out,

15:40.239 --> 15:42.173
And now suddenly
you're a genius?

15:42.207 --> 15:44.575
Yes, that Alan heung!
Are you deaf?

15:44.609 --> 15:48.244
Now butt out and go look for your
stupid books! So assuming you're seated
alphabetically,

15:48.279 --> 15:51.247
Then it'd be safe to assume if
there was some sort of paper

15:51.281 --> 15:54.217
With the aptitude scores on it,
that your name and score

15:54.251 --> 15:57.387
Would be right next to Alan
heung's name and score?

15:57.421 --> 16:00.824
God, brick, how am I supposed to know?
Do I work in the office?

16:00.858 --> 16:02.258
Okay.

16:02.293 --> 16:05.228
I'm starting to get
what you're saying.

16:05.262 --> 16:07.363
Go through it one moreime.

16:09.966 --> 16:11.400
(beep)

16:11.434 --> 16:14.103
Well, that explains it.
The scores were switched.

16:14.137 --> 16:15.571
You got a--

16:15.605 --> 16:17.473
Well, numbers don't
mean anything.

16:17.507 --> 16:20.442
The point is, you're our son,
and we love you.

16:20.477 --> 16:21.844
Oh, it means something.

16:21.878 --> 16:24.346
It means I am completely
living up to expectations.

16:24.380 --> 16:26.381
I am operating at compl.

16:26.415 --> 16:28.383
Yes!

16:28.417 --> 16:30.585
(yawns)

16:30.620 --> 16:32.087
(telephone rings)

16:32.121 --> 16:33.588
Hello?

16:33.623 --> 16:35.057
Hey, Carly.

16:35.091 --> 16:37.058
What?

16:37.093 --> 16:42.364
(vangelis' "titles" from
"chariots of fire" playing)

16:42.398 --> 16:44.900
(gasps) how's she doing?
She's gone around four times.

16:44.934 --> 16:47.970
She only has to make
it around one more lap,

16:48.005 --> 16:50.707
And she makes the team.

16:50.741 --> 16:53.610
(engine rumbles)

16:53.644 --> 16:57.280
?

17:06.223 --> 17:07.657
Should we stop her?

17:07.726 --> 17:10.595
Absolutely not. Go, Sue!

17:10.628 --> 17:14.165
?

17:14.199 --> 17:17.335
(panting) I can do it.

17:17.368 --> 17:18.770
I can do it.

17:21.339 --> 17:24.041
Things are starting
(thunder crashes)me.

17:24.076 --> 17:26.377
Ohh.

17:26.412 --> 17:28.580
Oh, come on!

17:28.614 --> 17:30.181
Ohh.

17:32.985 --> 17:35.987
She just keeps going.
Where does she get that from?

17:36.022 --> 17:37.990
From me. I Nev give up.

17:39.424 --> 17:42.393
You give up all the time.
You gave up this morning.

17:42.427 --> 17:43.794
You're right.

17:43.829 --> 17:45.830
As I was saying that sentence,

17:45.864 --> 17:48.399
I almost gave up and
stopped talking.

17:48.433 --> 17:52.570
You can do it! Lookin'...
Pretty good. (thunder crashes)

17:52.637 --> 17:56.006
?

17:56.041 --> 17:58.275
(splat)

18:01.445 --> 18:03.747
(exhales deeply)

18:05.750 --> 18:08.752
Come on, you can do it,
Barb! Barb!

18:08.819 --> 18:11.254
(all) Barb, Barb, Barb,
Barb, Barb, Barb!

18:11.289 --> 18:12.923
It's Sue!

18:12.957 --> 18:16.560
(all) Sue, Sue, Sue, Sue, Sue!

18:16.594 --> 18:18.662
(snap)

18:18.697 --> 18:21.098
(gasps)

18:22.700 --> 18:25.803
(thunder rumbles)

18:27.973 --> 18:30.774
(grunts)

18:30.809 --> 18:32.777
Come on! Go!

18:32.811 --> 18:34.612
You can do this!

18:34.646 --> 18:37.782
(Frankie) Whoo!
(brick) you can do this!

18:37.816 --> 18:40.352
(laughs)

18:40.386 --> 18:43.922
Barb, finish line's up here!
Come on!

18:43.957 --> 18:45.858
(pants) oh.

18:45.892 --> 18:49.727
That's okay. I got it. I got it!

18:49.762 --> 18:52.330
Yeah, you can do this! Come on!

18:52.364 --> 18:56.634
(brick) yeah,
you got it! You can do this!

18:56.669 --> 18:59.003
Whoo! Whoo! Yeah!

18:59.038 --> 19:01.372
Ohh.

19:01.407 --> 19:03.808
(all cheering)

19:03.843 --> 19:06.378
(brick) yeah, that was amazing!

19:06.412 --> 19:08.113
She did it.

19:08.147 --> 19:09.848
Sue did it.

19:09.882 --> 19:11.416
You okay?

19:11.450 --> 19:12.884
Sue finally made something.

19:12.918 --> 19:15.687
Sue made the no-cut
cross-country team.

19:15.722 --> 19:18.791
I've never been
morer proud  of .

19:18.825 --> 19:21.393
Oh, ow, ow, ow,
ow! Not under the arms!

19:21.428 --> 19:23.663
Okay, okay, okay.

19:23.697 --> 19:26.065
Aah! (laughs)

19:26.100 --> 19:30.136
?

19:30.170 --> 19:33.005
I'll see you in August.

19:35.075 --> 19:37.109
Aah! Whoo!

19:37.144 --> 19:39.111
Yeah!

19:39.146 --> 19:40.646
And guess what?

19:40.681 --> 19:42.615
Our lucky break
didn't end there.

19:43.950 --> 19:46.818
The next day, axl came home
with his world history test

19:46.853 --> 19:50.955
And the best grade of his life.
"b"-minus! I got a "b"-minus, people!
(laughs)

19:50.990 --> 19:53.925
And brick found a way to
make it to third grade--

19:53.959 --> 19:57.295
By checking out the me atlas
from the municipal library

19:57.329 --> 19:59.263
And returning it to
the school library.

19:59.298 --> 20:02.132
See you in the fall, Mrs.
Nethercott.

20:02.167 --> 20:05.803
I hear third graders get
to come to the library

20:05.837 --> 20:07.305
Even more often.

20:07.339 --> 20:09.641
(sighs)

20:09.675 --> 20:11.142
(clicks tongue)

20:11.176 --> 20:12.543
(sighs)

20:12.578 --> 20:15.113
And that night,
we celebrated it all--

20:15.147 --> 20:17.115
Sue making the no-cut team,

20:17.149 --> 20:19.084
Brick moving up to third grade,

20:19.118 --> 20:20.552
Axl's "b"-minus.

20:20.586 --> 20:23.388
So what I did was, I slept
through science and English,

20:23.423 --> 20:26.458
So I was completely refreshed for my
history test. So I got a practice
schedule and a parent phone tree.

20:26.493 --> 20:29.462
(Frankie) you did? Already?
That's quite a good plan there.

20:29.496 --> 20:32.031
Can you believe it? Yeah,
a phone tree! Wow...

20:32.065 --> 20:34.901
I know it may t seem
like much to celebrate.

20:34.935 --> 20:37.470
The truth is,
maybe we are just average.

20:37.505 --> 20:39.406
But the way I see it,

20:39.440 --> 20:41.975
Families where parents
get up every morning

20:42.009 --> 20:43.910
And go to jobs that are hard

20:43.945 --> 20:47.346
So they can get their kids
through school and through life

20:47.381 --> 20:49.815
And struggle to make it all work

20:49.950 --> 20:50.918
And manage to do it with
dignity and a little humor--

20:50.953 --> 20:53.054
Well, that's not average.
That's extraordinary.

20:53.088 --> 20:54.889
(speaking indistinctly)
