WEBVTT

00:02.872 --> 00:04.455
[Marcus] Thanks again for inviting
us, Martin.

00:04.539 --> 00:06.081
It's good getting to
know people in town.

00:06.164 --> 00:08.081
Glad you came along.
Should be fun.

00:08.164 --> 00:09.747
I hope so.

00:09.872 --> 00:11.831
I'm a little nervous about
heading out in a sinkable vessel

00:11.914 --> 00:13.998
with both Milo and Milo's dad.

00:14.081 --> 00:15.123
[chuckles] Oh, son.

00:15.206 --> 00:17.248
Every time he comes home
with a rip in his jeans

00:17.330 --> 00:19.289
or covered in
"Pterodactyl blood,"

00:19.372 --> 00:21.706
he credits it to some
Murphy family curse.

00:21.789 --> 00:24.414
[chuckling] Yeah.

00:24.497 --> 00:27.330
Mr. Underwood, I can assure
you that Murphy's Law is real.

00:27.414 --> 00:29.248
But I'm sure everything
will work out okay.

00:29.330 --> 00:32.872
Then why do we have 11 life
jackets for the four of us?

00:32.956 --> 00:36.123
Mathematically, it gives three of
us two-and-a-half second chances.

00:36.206 --> 00:38.831
[Zack] Well,
that's quasi-comforting, I guess.

00:38.914 --> 00:41.330
Hey, I'll catch up.
I'm gonna get some snacks.

00:42.497 --> 00:44.956
Four bags of pistachios please.

00:45.039 --> 00:46.831
Hey, it's you again.
The kid from the opera.

00:46.914 --> 00:49.580
Oh, yeah, and at the Doctor
Zone premiere too, right?

00:49.664 --> 00:51.248
I'm Milo. Milo Murphy.

00:51.330 --> 00:52.914
Vinnie Dakota. Nice to meet you.

00:52.998 --> 00:54.998
Nice to meet you.
What a coincidence.

00:55.081 --> 00:56.872
And thanks for the pistachios.

00:56.956 --> 00:58.580
Yeah, a coincidence...

00:59.164 --> 01:00.248
[exclaims]

01:05.831 --> 01:08.372
A swordfish... in fresh water?

01:08.455 --> 01:10.539
This is it! From headquarters.

01:10.622 --> 01:12.914
[exclaims] Where is the cart?

01:12.998 --> 01:15.539
- Well, there was this swordfish...
- In freshwater?

01:15.622 --> 01:16.998
I know, right?

01:17.081 --> 01:19.081
Never mind that.
Our new assignment.

01:19.164 --> 01:21.039
Every time I see that kid...

01:21.123 --> 01:23.330
"Wait for the container
ship from Tunisia..."

01:23.414 --> 01:25.998
Ooh, Tunisia.

01:26.081 --> 01:27.455
Sounds exotic.

01:27.539 --> 01:32.206
"And protect the pistachios."

01:32.289 --> 01:36.039
You know, I was aware that this was
not the most glamorous of assignments,

01:36.123 --> 01:38.206
but dagnabit!

01:38.289 --> 01:43.330
I didn't study time travel for 20 cycles
to end up as a blasted nut cart operator.

01:43.414 --> 01:44.956
I joined up to save the world.

01:45.039 --> 01:47.789
I joined up to prevent
the Mississippi Purchase.

01:47.872 --> 01:50.330
You, you mean the
Louisiana Purchase?

01:50.414 --> 01:51.956
You're welcome.

01:52.039 --> 01:53.123
This will not stand.

01:53.206 --> 01:54.372
Prepare yourself, Dakota.

01:54.455 --> 01:55.956
It's time to call the future.

01:56.039 --> 01:57.998
Let's see. What was that number?

01:58.956 --> 01:59.956
Ah, yes.

02:01.123 --> 02:02.123
It was four.

02:02.747 --> 02:03.747
Mmm-hmm.

02:04.414 --> 02:05.956
Battery is dead.

02:06.039 --> 02:08.580
I may know somebody with an
inter-temporal communicator. Come on.

02:14.164 --> 02:16.164
- Whoops!
- [squawking]

02:17.706 --> 02:19.706
See? Oh, that's not a curse.

02:19.789 --> 02:21.580
That's just
inexperienced casting.

02:21.664 --> 02:22.706
Lemme show you.

02:22.789 --> 02:24.164
Nice and easy.

02:26.164 --> 02:27.164
You see?

02:31.248 --> 02:32.372
Isn't this freshwater?

02:32.455 --> 02:34.164
And so it begins...

02:39.039 --> 02:40.622
[Dakota] Here we are.

02:40.706 --> 02:43.706
So, you're telling me that there is
an inter-temporal communicator here?

02:43.789 --> 02:45.081
Yeah. At this party?

02:45.164 --> 02:46.330
Hey, look, piggies in a blanket.

02:48.330 --> 02:49.539
There. Over there.

02:50.998 --> 02:53.123
[Cavendish] Brick and Savannah.
Of course!

02:53.206 --> 02:55.081
Fellow time travelers.
They'll have one.

02:55.164 --> 02:57.289
Ugh, what are they doing here?

02:57.372 --> 03:00.289
Brick, Savannah,
normally I wouldn't ask this of you

03:00.372 --> 03:02.330
but it seems that the
batteries on my...

03:02.414 --> 03:05.206
Wait a moment. You get tuxedos?

03:05.289 --> 03:06.539
Yes. And you get...

03:10.123 --> 03:11.123
High school theater costumes?

03:11.206 --> 03:12.497
Hey, it's all the past.

03:12.580 --> 03:14.123
We decided to go with the '70s.

03:14.206 --> 03:18.164
Yes, but one of you is from the
1970s and one from the 1870s.

03:18.248 --> 03:19.622
Really? Which one am I?

03:19.706 --> 03:21.039
Look,
we're kind of in a pinch here.

03:21.123 --> 03:22.289
See, there was this swordfish,

03:22.372 --> 03:24.330
and when we tried to use
the battery it was dead.

03:24.414 --> 03:26.123
The battery, not the swordfish.

03:26.206 --> 03:29.330
So we're just wondering if it would
be possible for us to use your...

03:29.414 --> 03:30.956
- They're on the move.
- Copy that.

03:33.831 --> 03:35.664
Hey! Why don't we get earpieces?

03:35.747 --> 03:37.580
We're standing right
next to each other.

03:37.664 --> 03:40.330
- Yeah, so were they!
- Oh, come on.

03:40.414 --> 03:42.998
But be sure to add a little
margarine to the butter.

03:43.081 --> 03:44.664
- That way it won't burn.
- Yeah?

03:44.747 --> 03:46.580
- [grunts]
- Wait! So when do I add the flour?

03:47.998 --> 03:49.706
[both grunting]

03:51.539 --> 03:52.539
[chuckles smugly]

03:52.622 --> 03:53.706
[groans]

03:55.248 --> 03:56.789
Well, you got to admit

03:56.872 --> 03:59.455
this is a much cooler
mission than we have.

03:59.539 --> 04:01.248
[Dakota] Oh, look at that.
It's like a pen key.

04:01.330 --> 04:02.872
- [beeping]
- [Dakota] Spiffy.

04:05.248 --> 04:07.206
Oh, he's an art lover.

04:07.289 --> 04:09.789
Ooh,
secret panel for hidden safes.

04:09.872 --> 04:13.081
Oh, come on!
They get all the good stuff.

04:13.164 --> 04:14.831
Look,
if it's not too much trouble,

04:14.914 --> 04:17.206
we would like to borrow your
inter-temporal communicator.

04:17.289 --> 04:18.789
It's extremely important.

04:18.872 --> 04:20.372
[imitating] Oh, extremely important.

04:20.497 --> 04:22.206
Important is saving the world,

04:22.289 --> 04:25.081
preserving the future,
stopping World War 5.

04:25.164 --> 04:26.872
What happened to
World War 3 and 4?

04:26.956 --> 04:29.123
- You're welcome.
- Nice.

04:29.206 --> 04:32.289
Say, you think it's
possible that a guy like me

04:32.372 --> 04:34.248
and a girl like you...

04:34.330 --> 04:36.414
[groans]

04:36.497 --> 04:39.289
You know, all this does
is make me like you more.

04:41.747 --> 04:43.831
- Got it.
- Lars, bring the car around.

04:46.039 --> 04:47.831
[Cavendish] Your time
vehicle is a limousine?

04:47.914 --> 04:49.372
Of course. What do you have?

04:49.455 --> 04:51.664
[stammers] Well, you know.
It's just...

04:51.747 --> 04:53.123
It's just different.

04:53.206 --> 04:54.289
[chittering]

04:56.455 --> 04:59.206
[Brick] Next stop,
Dr. Grueber's lab, October 1983.

05:02.706 --> 05:04.330
Finally, a bite!

05:05.497 --> 05:06.330
Hey!

05:08.081 --> 05:09.081
[grunts]

05:10.998 --> 05:11.998
Whoa!

05:14.998 --> 05:16.206
[grumbles]

05:20.081 --> 05:22.248
Yeah, okay.
Murphy's Law, real thing.

05:22.330 --> 05:24.330
Maybe we should
try another spot.

05:37.248 --> 05:38.956
Oh, the humanity! [screams]

05:41.414 --> 05:42.914
So, how was your
fishing, Dolores?

05:42.998 --> 05:44.455
- [motor whirs]
- Good girl.

05:46.289 --> 05:48.206
Don't worry.
We've always got a backup plan.

05:52.664 --> 05:53.831
[Martin] There. You see?

05:55.206 --> 05:56.914
[Zack] Whatever can go wrong...

05:58.998 --> 06:00.747
[Milo] Will go wrong.

06:00.831 --> 06:03.455
You know, you really shouldn't
mix your South American

06:03.539 --> 06:05.123
and your African cichlids.

06:05.206 --> 06:08.289
I made that mistake once.
Cost me $34.

06:08.372 --> 06:10.123
I don't see why you lot
get all the good stuff.

06:10.206 --> 06:11.747
Where's my limo?
Where's my fish tank?

06:11.831 --> 06:13.580
Where's my attractive partner?

06:13.664 --> 06:15.123
Hey! I'm sitting right here.

06:15.206 --> 06:17.580
Look, Cavendish,
you're barely even agents.

06:17.664 --> 06:20.289
You are the lowest of
low-level government employees,

06:20.372 --> 06:22.914
paired together because
no one else will have you.

06:22.998 --> 06:25.497
You were given the most
inconsequential mission possible,

06:25.580 --> 06:28.206
to save the pistachio,
a green nut,

06:28.289 --> 06:31.414
only because our boss liked them when he
was a kid, before they became extinct.

06:34.497 --> 06:36.497
So, if you don't want to
lose your jobs altogether,

06:36.580 --> 06:40.789
you better get back to work and make darn
sure the pistachio survives until 2085.

06:40.872 --> 06:42.872
- Now hold on just one minute!
- [exclaiming]

06:44.580 --> 06:47.248
Please tell me it didn't just
go into the water system.

06:47.330 --> 06:48.789
It went into the water system.

06:48.872 --> 06:50.789
Do you have any idea
what you've just done?

06:51.414 --> 06:53.455
[rumbling]

06:53.872 --> 06:56.039
[roaring]

07:00.706 --> 07:02.872
[Cavendish] Your time
vehicle is a limousine?

07:02.956 --> 07:04.330
Of course. What do you have?

07:04.414 --> 07:06.789
[stammers] Well, you know.
It's just...

07:06.914 --> 07:08.289
It's just different.
You know what?

07:08.372 --> 07:10.580
- Let's just get in the car.
- [Savannah] Oh no, you don't.

07:10.664 --> 07:12.872
- You're not getting in that car again.
- Why? What?

07:12.956 --> 07:15.580
You already went back in time with
us once and screwed everything up.

07:15.664 --> 07:17.372
Don't worry.
We went back and fixed it.

07:17.455 --> 07:20.414
But there's no way we're
letting you go muck it up again.

07:20.497 --> 07:22.539
You look great in that
dress, by the way.

07:22.622 --> 07:23.872
You've been working out.

07:23.956 --> 07:25.372
You know I have.

07:25.455 --> 07:27.206
Wait. We're time travel
agents just like you.

07:27.289 --> 07:28.372
Why do we not get...

07:28.455 --> 07:29.539
We don't have time to
explain this again.

07:29.622 --> 07:31.123
Talk to the boss.

07:31.206 --> 07:32.206
[beeping]

07:32.289 --> 07:33.914
Cavendish? What do you want?

07:33.998 --> 07:35.123
Mr. Block, sir!

07:35.206 --> 07:37.455
We were hoping to get
a different assignment.

07:37.539 --> 07:40.039
One more saving-the-world based

07:40.123 --> 07:42.414
and less nut related.

07:42.497 --> 07:47.914
Well, I'm looking at this can of mixed
nuts and, hmm, I don't see any pistachios.

07:47.998 --> 07:52.039
You two were given the most
inconsequential assignment we could find

07:52.123 --> 07:55.039
and you still always
manage to muck that up.

07:55.123 --> 07:59.248
So, until I see some green nuts in
this can, you're on pistachio duty.

07:59.330 --> 08:00.539
Now, get back to work!

08:02.831 --> 08:05.580
Their limo smells
like peppermint.

08:05.664 --> 08:08.414
[Milo] We can use these scuba
tanks to propel the ship.

08:08.497 --> 08:10.872
One on starboard, one on port,

08:10.956 --> 08:12.414
so that way we can steer.

08:12.497 --> 08:13.497
Knock on wood.

08:15.330 --> 08:16.622
[whooshing]

08:20.414 --> 08:22.081
You gotta be kidding me!

08:22.164 --> 08:23.330
See? See?

08:24.414 --> 08:25.706
[all scream]

08:27.164 --> 08:28.706
Well, at least we're moving now.

08:28.789 --> 08:30.414
Now you believe me?

08:30.497 --> 08:32.580
We're heading straight for that
container ship from Tunisia!

08:33.706 --> 08:35.914
And the steering wheel's broken.

08:35.998 --> 08:38.164
Hang on, Dad. I've got an idea.

08:39.539 --> 08:40.789
Look on the bright side.

08:40.872 --> 08:44.539
My entire career has been
one big inconsequential joke.

08:44.622 --> 08:45.831
Where is the bright side?

08:45.914 --> 08:49.497
The pistachio shipment
is here and unharmed.

08:49.580 --> 08:52.539
Here, Dad. Wrap this
around the steering column.

08:52.622 --> 08:53.539
Come on, guys.

08:54.539 --> 08:57.289
- Everybody, lean!
- [creaking]

08:57.372 --> 08:58.455
Come on, Dad.

08:58.539 --> 08:59.998
[both grunting]

09:03.164 --> 09:04.372
Milo, it's working.

09:05.455 --> 09:07.747
Comin' in hot. Everyone hold on!

09:07.831 --> 09:09.539
Hey, at least it
can't get any worse.

09:13.956 --> 09:16.414
[screaming]

09:17.872 --> 09:19.455
[all screaming]

09:22.414 --> 09:24.664
May I take your order?
Who's hungry?

09:24.747 --> 09:26.123
Yeah, I could eat.

09:26.206 --> 09:28.414
That's that Milo Murphy
I was telling you about.

09:28.497 --> 09:31.497
Every time our pistachios get
ruined, he's there.

09:31.580 --> 09:33.497
- Every time.
- No.

09:33.580 --> 09:35.664
And he almost took out
the shipment just then.

09:35.747 --> 09:36.747
That's preposterous.

09:39.664 --> 09:40.580
Whoa!

09:44.123 --> 09:45.580
See?

09:45.664 --> 09:47.497
But that would mean... [gasps]

09:47.580 --> 09:48.497
He's trying to stop us.

09:48.580 --> 09:50.539
He's trying to ruin our mission.

09:50.622 --> 09:53.372
Dakota, what we are doing
here is not inconsequential.

09:53.455 --> 09:56.580
If it's important enough to send
a counter-agent, it must be vital.

09:56.664 --> 09:57.706
Hey, now,
you're getting a little...

09:57.789 --> 10:00.539
We are not just
nut-guarding nobodies.

10:00.622 --> 10:03.998
We are secret-spy somebodies
with our very own counter agent.

10:04.081 --> 10:05.539
Well,
I guess things are looking up.

10:05.622 --> 10:07.372
Just look at him over there,

10:07.455 --> 10:09.206
plotting our demise.

10:09.289 --> 10:11.289
I sure love cheese fries.

10:13.497 --> 10:16.622
Oh, this is not
over, Milo Murphy.
