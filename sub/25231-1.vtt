01:20.422 --> 01:22.130
Stop the vehicle immediately.

01:22.922 --> 01:24.130
Stop it right there.

01:25.088 --> 01:26.297
I repeat, pull over.

01:29.505 --> 01:32.338
I am giving you a direction
to stop the vehicle.

01:32.505 --> 01:35.463
Failure to comply with my direction
is an offense.

01:35.797 --> 01:37.047
Stop the tractor.

01:37.838 --> 01:40.005
You are under arrest for trespass

01:40.088 --> 01:41.672
and theft of a conveyance.

01:42.297 --> 01:44.297
Stop being a dickhead and pull over.

01:44.380 --> 01:47.172
I can't, mate.
I'm trying to get to the airport.

01:59.088 --> 02:00.213
OK, OK.

02:05.672 --> 02:08.047
Ahh!

02:11.838 --> 02:12.838
Sorry.

02:17.630 --> 02:18.922
My dad has a saying.

02:24.047 --> 02:25.672
A lie begins in the soul

02:26.047 --> 02:27.672
and then travels the world.

02:32.380 --> 02:35.255
There have been three lies
that have shaped my life.

02:35.338 --> 02:39.297
The first is the one that saved
my father's life before I was born.

02:41.255 --> 02:43.380
Mahdi! Baathists! Run!

02:43.672 --> 02:45.755
Mother, go!

02:46.380 --> 02:47.838
Mahdi, come with us.

02:47.922 --> 02:49.130
I can't leave my mother.

02:49.422 --> 02:50.713
Mother, you must go!

02:52.213 --> 02:53.338
No, take me!

02:53.672 --> 02:55.463
-He's a good boy.
-Mother, no!

02:56.130 --> 02:57.297
Leave her!

03:01.588 --> 03:05.463
He was arrested by Saddam Hussein's men
for opposing the dictator.

03:09.338 --> 03:10.880
He would have been killed,

03:12.005 --> 03:15.213
had it not been for his friends
posing as prison guards.

03:16.797 --> 03:17.630
Mahdi.

03:33.130 --> 03:35.755
They escaped
by crossing the border to Iran.

03:36.380 --> 03:38.047
Surely, that was a good lie?

03:38.130 --> 03:39.380
I mean, without it,

03:39.463 --> 03:41.297
I wouldn't even be here today.

03:43.463 --> 03:45.463
The second lie was us believing

03:45.547 --> 03:47.880
we could have a life as Iraqis in Iran.

03:47.963 --> 03:49.130
Whoa, Ali, look.

03:49.505 --> 03:50.838
Persian girls are hot.

03:51.130 --> 03:52.172
Move over. My turn.

03:55.547 --> 03:56.588
Did you see that?

03:56.755 --> 03:58.213
She just flashed me.

03:58.297 --> 04:00.380
You godless Arab donkey!

04:00.588 --> 04:02.755
She fell into my eye, I promise!

04:04.838 --> 04:06.172
Ali, look over there.

04:06.380 --> 04:07.797
Where? I can't see anything.

04:07.922 --> 04:09.172
Behind the door.

04:12.172 --> 04:14.338
God! She has red hair!

04:15.838 --> 04:19.005
You lying Arab donkey. Again?
I should send you back to Saddam!

04:19.088 --> 04:22.172
I wasn't looking! I swear on the Prophet!

04:22.255 --> 04:25.547
Eventually, we realized
we were never going to make it in Iran.

04:27.088 --> 04:29.630
We have just flown out of Iranian airspace

04:29.713 --> 04:32.047
and can now serve alcohol in all cabins.

04:32.130 --> 04:35.963
So please, sit back and enjoy
our in-flight service to Melbourne.

04:41.380 --> 04:42.380
So it begins.

04:43.588 --> 04:45.005
Swap.

04:46.088 --> 04:48.880
This leads to my third lie,
my biggest lie.

04:50.255 --> 04:52.505
Do I look like someone who eats bacon?

04:52.588 --> 04:54.630
And as you and God are my witnesses...

04:54.713 --> 04:56.630
Come Judgment Day, you answer.

04:56.713 --> 04:58.880
Today, this lie must end.

04:58.963 --> 05:01.880
Today, I will tell you the whole truth.

05:19.755 --> 05:21.005
Prayer has started.

05:21.088 --> 05:23.088
Kill them, Bombers! Kill them!

05:23.422 --> 05:26.922
God be with you, Watson. Run!

05:27.422 --> 05:29.922
-Goal!
-Yes, come on Bombers.

05:30.005 --> 05:31.588
Ali, study.

05:33.213 --> 05:36.380
-Mineralocorticoids...
-God is with us!

05:36.797 --> 05:37.630
Om Hassan.

05:38.588 --> 05:39.755
Remember Yaqoub,

05:39.838 --> 05:40.797
from my village?

05:41.130 --> 05:43.922
Mustafa found him here,
in the detention center.

05:44.213 --> 05:45.713
Yaqoub knows the guy

05:45.797 --> 05:48.672
who supplies my cousin Jaasem’s shop
in Basra.

05:48.755 --> 05:50.547
Beep beep. Mafia coming through.

05:50.630 --> 05:53.088
-Om Hassan.
-Wait, Mohammed.

05:53.172 --> 05:56.088
-Mum, don't worry.
-What are you doing?

05:56.172 --> 05:58.672
The supplier told Yaqoub he...

05:59.672 --> 06:00.588
Om Hassan.

06:01.005 --> 06:01.838
Please listen.

06:02.422 --> 06:04.463
The supplier told Yaqoub,

06:04.922 --> 06:06.088
he saw my mother.

06:08.755 --> 06:10.255
My mother. Alive.

06:11.463 --> 06:13.047
-Still alive?
-In Basra.

06:13.380 --> 06:15.463
-Grandmother is alive?
-Ali, study.

06:16.297 --> 06:17.338
Thank God.

06:17.505 --> 06:19.838
I may finally have a mother-in-law.

06:19.922 --> 06:20.755
God willing.

06:22.297 --> 06:23.547
One week to go, son.

06:24.963 --> 06:26.630
Keep doing what you're doing.

06:27.130 --> 06:28.547
You will reap rewards.

06:28.630 --> 06:29.963
Come on, Bombers.

06:30.047 --> 06:31.172
Top student.

06:31.255 --> 06:33.672
-Prayer has started.
-This is the last quarter.

06:33.755 --> 06:36.588
-What's this?
-Adult science. You wouldn't know it.

06:37.380 --> 06:38.213
What is it?

06:38.463 --> 06:40.672
If you must know, it's the pancreas.

06:40.880 --> 06:42.213
-Om Hassan.
-Lucky guess.

06:42.630 --> 06:43.547
Go away, Ramona.

06:44.838 --> 06:46.588
♪ Tick tock, tick tock♪

06:46.797 --> 06:47.922
♪ Will you pass?♪

06:48.588 --> 06:49.505
♪ Will you not?♪

06:49.588 --> 06:51.047
Tackle.

06:51.130 --> 06:51.963
Baba.

06:52.880 --> 06:55.297
Bring your mother
and your costume for the play.

06:55.380 --> 06:58.922
Why did we choose the Bombers?
All they do is tear my heart apart.

06:59.463 --> 07:00.297
Like you.

07:14.005 --> 07:17.047
In the time of the Bani Umayyah empire,

07:17.463 --> 07:20.797
the prince and his treasurer
were walking along,

07:21.130 --> 07:23.797
when they came across an old man,

07:23.880 --> 07:25.380
planting a date seed.

07:25.463 --> 07:30.922
This date seed will only bear fruit
after your death.

07:32.213 --> 07:33.588
What will you gain?

07:34.963 --> 07:37.297
Old men have planted before me

07:37.922 --> 07:40.297
and I have eaten their fruit.

07:40.588 --> 07:42.922
The prince was very moved by this.

07:43.130 --> 07:45.130
He turned to his treasurer and said...

07:45.213 --> 07:48.088
Wow, old man, you are so--

07:48.172 --> 07:50.422
Ali, son. No improvising, please.

07:50.505 --> 07:51.338
Sorry.

07:53.088 --> 07:54.130
Sister, please.

07:54.880 --> 07:58.963
-And replied:
-Exalted one. You suggest...

07:59.047 --> 08:02.088
Jamal's parents came last week
to ask for her hand,

08:02.797 --> 08:04.922
and they did not get to drink the tea.

08:05.005 --> 08:06.422
-Mum.
-What?

08:06.505 --> 08:07.588
Thank you, Yomna.

08:07.672 --> 08:10.838
The prince turned to his treasurer

08:10.922 --> 08:13.255
signaling for another purse.

08:13.338 --> 08:15.088
I'm signaling for another purse.

08:15.172 --> 08:17.963
But this time his treasurer
put up his hand and said:

08:18.047 --> 08:19.963
Enough wisdom.

08:20.172 --> 08:23.380
This damn date seed
will bankrupt our kingdom.

08:29.630 --> 08:32.422
He thinks this place
is a theater for making jokes,

08:33.422 --> 08:36.712
and they pay him,
and I'm the one driving a taxi.

08:36.797 --> 08:37.880
Brothers and sisters.

08:40.005 --> 08:42.837
We do not know what fruit
our seeds will bear.

08:44.422 --> 08:45.880
But if our hearts

08:45.963 --> 08:48.422
and intentions are pure,

08:49.797 --> 08:53.547
the rewards can be
a thousand times what we expect.

09:04.130 --> 09:06.505
Auditions for this year's musical

09:06.588 --> 09:08.922
will be held after Friday prayer.

09:10.797 --> 09:14.088
Will we encore our hit show,
The Prophet's Last Battle?

09:14.172 --> 09:15.297
I still know my lines.

09:15.380 --> 09:18.463
Hajjina, we have been singing
about the Prophet's battle

09:18.547 --> 09:20.005
for three years now.

09:21.047 --> 09:24.047
This year, inshallah,
I will write a more...

09:24.672 --> 09:25.922
contemporary musical.

09:26.005 --> 09:28.005
I'm tingling with anticipation.

09:28.088 --> 09:30.297
The Trial of Saddam Hussein.

09:33.213 --> 09:34.422
It will be comedy.

09:34.922 --> 09:37.380
The man caused us so much pain.

09:38.088 --> 09:40.338
Believe me, now he will make us laugh.

09:43.088 --> 09:44.172
What brilliance.

09:44.255 --> 09:45.380
Sheikhna!

09:45.630 --> 09:48.130
You follow in the steps of a great man.

09:48.713 --> 09:51.630
May you draw upon his wisdom
for your exam.

09:58.588 --> 09:59.630
-Ayoob.
-Yeah.

09:59.880 --> 10:00.755
That's her.

10:01.047 --> 10:01.880
Who?

10:03.255 --> 10:04.755
I'm going to talk to her.

10:04.880 --> 10:05.963
Not here.

10:07.297 --> 10:08.130
Ali, no.

10:14.713 --> 10:17.422
I'll get the jumper leads from my car.
I'll help you.

10:17.505 --> 10:19.255
Yes, please. Jumper leads.

10:19.338 --> 10:20.797
OK. Thank you very much.

10:20.922 --> 10:21.755
Thank you.

10:24.047 --> 10:25.713
Will you be wanting milk tonight?

10:27.713 --> 10:29.547
Ali, my boy,

10:30.422 --> 10:32.547
I missed your father's wisdom?

10:32.922 --> 10:33.963
Just by an hour.

10:35.547 --> 10:38.463
It's not my fault. I blame my wives.

10:39.130 --> 10:40.380
Especially that one.

10:41.130 --> 10:42.588
The tall one.

10:43.088 --> 10:46.880
She has to stop for Nando's,

10:47.463 --> 10:51.005
and she left the damn headlights on.

10:52.463 --> 10:53.505
What are you doing?

10:54.588 --> 10:55.422
Ali.

10:57.963 --> 10:59.297
Eyes here.

11:01.130 --> 11:02.005
Jumper leads!

11:06.547 --> 11:09.838
I hope you're ready for the big exam,
son of the cleric.

11:11.005 --> 11:13.380
Jumper leads!

11:13.797 --> 11:16.380
-Man, you won't get into medicine.
-Yes, I will.

11:16.463 --> 11:18.963
-I got a degree in science, didn't I?
-Just.

11:19.047 --> 11:21.213
They gave him a science degree too.

11:22.297 --> 11:25.797
Yeah, but he hasn't spent the last year
studying for the entrance exam.

11:25.880 --> 11:26.713
Have you?

11:26.797 --> 11:29.922
Look man, I'm physically, emotionally
and spiritually ready

11:30.005 --> 11:31.713
to sit this goddamn exam.

11:31.797 --> 11:33.422
Do you even want to do medicine?

11:33.505 --> 11:34.963
He has to sit the exam.

11:35.047 --> 11:37.672
I'm a forklift driver.
My father makes me sit the exam.

11:37.755 --> 11:39.880
Except I'm smart enough
to know I'm stupid.

11:39.963 --> 11:41.463
-Put it back.
-Twinnies.

11:41.922 --> 11:44.088
I don't want to know. Reseal it.

11:44.172 --> 11:45.338
Hey, is that the one?

11:47.297 --> 11:48.130
Oh yeah.

11:48.755 --> 11:51.088
Tonight's the night.
I'm going to talk to her.

11:51.172 --> 11:53.922
-You already did.
-Yeah, we had a great conversation.

11:54.005 --> 11:55.797
-But this is the next level.
-Ali.

11:55.880 --> 11:58.297
Don't do the stupid voice. No one gets it.

12:20.130 --> 12:21.130
Good evening.

12:22.672 --> 12:24.338
I see you came for the milk.

12:25.338 --> 12:27.630
And I've got something special
to show you.

12:27.963 --> 12:29.588
Or a special that we have.

12:30.005 --> 12:32.172
The Chupa Chups. They're on special.

12:33.213 --> 12:35.380
Not a special. Ten for five dollars.

12:36.088 --> 12:38.547
So if I spend $50,
you'd give me 100?

12:39.797 --> 12:41.588
We don't have that many in stock.

12:41.755 --> 12:43.422
It's a pity. That's all I wanted.

12:44.672 --> 12:47.422
Do you need a hand carrying these
to your father's shop?

12:49.463 --> 12:51.255
-It's two bottles.
-So you're OK?

12:51.338 --> 12:52.172
Yeah, I'm OK.

12:54.797 --> 12:59.547
Are you sure
you don't want the president of Iraq

12:59.630 --> 13:01.880
to help you carry the milk bottles?

13:07.880 --> 13:08.922
Dictator.

13:12.172 --> 13:14.088
That was Saddam Hussein's voice.

13:14.922 --> 13:17.422
-You can Google it.
-I don't think I will be.

13:18.297 --> 13:21.963
-You sitting the medical entrance exam?
-Yeah. I'm going to be a doctor.

13:23.588 --> 13:24.422
Charlie.

13:24.505 --> 13:27.713
My name's Ali, but this is
the Aussie version, so it's Charlie.

13:27.797 --> 13:30.005
Yeah, I know who you are,
son of the cleric.

13:30.088 --> 13:31.713
And I know who you are, Dianne.

13:31.797 --> 13:33.922
You're the daughter
of the fish and chip man.

13:34.005 --> 13:37.047
Thanks. It's how I like to be remembered.

13:37.922 --> 13:39.797
Just put it on the account, will you?

13:43.047 --> 13:44.088
-Hooroo!
-Sayonara!

13:44.172 --> 13:45.088
Salaam alaikum!

13:45.297 --> 13:48.380
You idiots. You just ruined it for me.

13:48.463 --> 13:49.713
Yeah, I ruined it for you.

13:49.797 --> 13:51.713
It wasn't the Saddam voice
that killed it.

13:51.797 --> 13:54.963
-You need to get married, like me.
-You got married by mistake.

13:55.047 --> 13:57.338
-Did you knock her up?
-It's a damn tea ceremony.

13:57.422 --> 13:58.255
It's a minefield.

13:58.338 --> 14:01.380
Turks do it different to Persians.
They do it different to us.

14:01.463 --> 14:05.005
-How do you guys do it?
-It doesn't matter. The sex is the same.

14:05.088 --> 14:06.547
Unbelievable, man.

14:06.963 --> 14:09.755
And my wife reckons
I'm starting to get the hang of it.

14:09.963 --> 14:11.213
You animal.

14:13.380 --> 14:15.130
Retroperitoneal...

14:24.005 --> 14:25.380
Baba?

14:26.005 --> 14:28.130
-Thinking about your big exam?
-Of course.

14:30.213 --> 14:31.047
I found this.

14:32.172 --> 14:33.255
Hassan's initials.

14:34.547 --> 14:37.463
I put it on when
he won the math prize in Abadan.

14:38.547 --> 14:39.588
I remember that.

14:40.130 --> 14:42.130
He would have made a great doctor.

14:45.047 --> 14:48.963
It may not bring you luck,
but it might bring you comfort.

14:53.047 --> 14:54.297
Come. Breakfast.

15:12.213 --> 15:13.755
Cinema? Are you crazy?

15:14.713 --> 15:15.755
It's genius!

15:17.672 --> 15:20.547
We join a random family
and sit next to their daughters.

15:21.088 --> 15:22.588
What if the film is no good?

15:23.380 --> 15:27.922
Who cares about the film? Girls!

15:28.505 --> 15:30.338
Ali, look at what I found!

15:43.213 --> 15:44.047
[land mine clicks[

15:53.880 --> 15:54.713
Ali!

16:30.255 --> 16:31.088
Charlie.

16:32.297 --> 16:33.130
Hey.

16:34.380 --> 16:36.297
You never told me you were doing medicine.

16:36.380 --> 16:38.297
Didn't know I needed your permission.

16:38.838 --> 16:41.338
No, I mean we could have studied together.

16:44.505 --> 16:45.338
Pst.

16:46.797 --> 16:48.130
I got your Chupa Chups in.

16:48.713 --> 16:50.713
I'm about to do a seven-hour exam.

16:50.963 --> 16:51.880
Stop talking.

16:55.630 --> 16:56.463
Ali.

16:57.922 --> 16:58.797
Hey, Luay.

16:59.922 --> 17:00.755
Good luck.

17:01.838 --> 17:03.172
Yeah, you too.

17:33.797 --> 17:35.838
Baba habib.

17:42.963 --> 17:46.005
My leader,
you are gracious to spare this time.

17:47.047 --> 17:49.547
-For such a foolish man.
-Please, Hajjina.

17:49.963 --> 17:51.588
Ali will serve as witness.

17:52.838 --> 17:55.588
What are you doing?
That's my racket, you idiot.

17:55.838 --> 18:00.088
We must all take a leaf
out of this family's book.

18:00.172 --> 18:03.172
Your children have self-respect.

18:03.255 --> 18:06.838
This house is exactly
as we have come to know of the Prophet.

18:06.922 --> 18:09.755
We are all beneath God's wide...

18:10.463 --> 18:12.255
generous shadow, but...

18:13.338 --> 18:14.172
Please.

18:15.005 --> 18:16.338
-To your issue.
-Sheikhna.

18:18.130 --> 18:19.797
The last day of Ramadan,

18:21.130 --> 18:22.797
I coached soccer all day.

18:22.880 --> 18:25.505
No water, no food. 100 degrees.

18:25.588 --> 18:27.880
And I come home
and she has burnt the lamb.

18:29.713 --> 18:31.880
The baklava is like concrete.

18:34.088 --> 18:35.797
Tea, Haj?

18:37.380 --> 18:40.880
Even within this house
there is the occasional angry word.

18:41.172 --> 18:42.172
No, my leader.

18:43.005 --> 18:46.005
In my anger, I divorced her three times.

18:46.338 --> 18:48.213
-You said the words three times?
-More.

18:48.422 --> 18:49.255
It was more.

18:50.922 --> 18:53.505
Unfortunately,
you are from the Hanafi faith

18:53.588 --> 18:54.880
and once you say to God,

18:54.963 --> 18:57.255
"I divorce my wife," three times...

18:58.380 --> 18:59.755
there is no going back.

18:59.838 --> 19:02.797
I lost the most beautiful woman
in the world

19:02.880 --> 19:04.880
over a piece of baklava.

19:15.380 --> 19:16.380
To be clear.

19:18.338 --> 19:20.922
When you uttered the words,
"I divorce you,"

19:21.005 --> 19:23.963
did you say, "I divorce you,"
and then have a shower?

19:24.672 --> 19:27.838
And then come out and say it again?

19:28.047 --> 19:31.297
And take a walk,
and say it again for a third time?

19:31.422 --> 19:35.255
I said it all in one terrible moment,

19:35.338 --> 19:37.005
that will haunt me for eternity.

19:38.005 --> 19:40.588
So, it was one thought.

19:41.755 --> 19:42.672
A continuum.

19:43.588 --> 19:44.505
A singularity.

19:44.755 --> 19:46.422
What do you mean, my leader?

19:46.672 --> 19:49.130
In soccer, when Ali kicks a goal,

19:49.755 --> 19:52.172
the crowd cry, "Goal, goal, goal!"

19:52.255 --> 19:54.713
But how many goals has Ali kicked?

19:55.588 --> 19:57.088
-One.
-One thought.

19:58.463 --> 19:59.963
One divorce.

20:05.505 --> 20:09.463
Go to your wife
and commit to her with all your heart.

20:09.838 --> 20:11.047
Even to the baklava.

20:12.630 --> 20:14.713
You have saved my family.

20:19.005 --> 20:21.880
May you grow in his shadow

20:21.963 --> 20:23.463
and guide us all,

20:23.547 --> 20:25.547
and with a good wife by your side.

20:27.005 --> 20:28.338
See you at rehearsals, Ali.

20:29.505 --> 20:32.213
♪ Sheikh has once again saved my life♪

20:32.630 --> 20:34.922
♪ Now I get to go back to my wife♪

20:35.005 --> 20:36.713
Can you make your own laws, Dad?

20:37.422 --> 20:38.255
Believe me.

20:38.338 --> 20:41.088
Even the Prophet
would not have wanted a divorce.

20:41.588 --> 20:43.755
No man is complete without marriage.

20:45.213 --> 20:46.047
But tell me.

20:46.755 --> 20:47.922
How was your exam?

20:48.880 --> 20:49.713
Good.

20:49.838 --> 20:51.880
-You got a top mark?
-Guaranteed.

20:56.547 --> 20:58.213
Have you told Dad you're fucked?

20:58.297 --> 20:59.963
You won't even get 80, man.

21:00.047 --> 21:03.088
You don't know that for sure.
I answered all the questions.

21:03.505 --> 21:04.838
You know I love you, bro?

21:04.922 --> 21:07.005
Stop pretending
you're like the old man.

21:07.588 --> 21:09.797
You and I both know
we'll never be as good as him.

21:10.922 --> 21:14.088
Johnno, you fucking dickhead.
You're cleaning that, asshole.

21:14.172 --> 21:15.005
Mohammed.

21:15.463 --> 21:18.297
This is my job, Dad.
I have to speak Australian.

21:18.380 --> 21:21.630
Get me the fucking keys
to the car you were meant to put there.

21:22.255 --> 21:23.088
Please.

21:31.172 --> 21:32.005
Dad.

21:32.380 --> 21:34.963
We're meant to believe in miracles?
They do happen?

21:36.047 --> 21:36.963
There is a riddle.

21:37.047 --> 21:38.922
A bridge is about to collapse.

21:39.297 --> 21:41.088
Any weight, it would crumble...

21:43.338 --> 21:44.463
What is this?

21:46.797 --> 21:48.172
Your temporary transport.

21:57.422 --> 21:59.005
Hey, mate. Don't put it in.

22:06.963 --> 22:08.672
Please God, prove your existence.

22:33.172 --> 22:34.005
Hey, Ali.

22:34.297 --> 22:35.838
Ali, hurry.

22:36.547 --> 22:40.838
Seyyed Ghaffar has thrown a barbecue party
for his son.

22:41.672 --> 22:44.047
Young Luay got 96 for his exam!

22:44.130 --> 22:47.172
96,2. But what is a number?

22:47.505 --> 22:50.255
I'm sure your family will throw
an even bigger celebration.

22:51.547 --> 22:53.963
I have to speak to my father.
Is he inside?

22:54.297 --> 22:56.797
Our leader is giving brother Qais comfort.

22:56.880 --> 22:58.963
Marital problems.

22:59.047 --> 23:01.380
-Finally, someone who's not a taxi driver.
-Please.

23:01.463 --> 23:04.463
My son and I are merely slaves of God.

23:04.755 --> 23:06.588
If my son becomes a doctor,

23:07.505 --> 23:09.047
and serves this community,

23:09.130 --> 23:13.547
it is not because of my genes
or my endless hours of schooling.

23:14.297 --> 23:15.130
It is...

23:16.213 --> 23:17.047
Him.

23:22.463 --> 23:24.380
Ali. My good friend.

23:25.797 --> 23:28.172
University of Melbourne,
here we come.

23:28.505 --> 23:30.130
96,2, huh?

23:30.463 --> 23:33.672
Maybe we should not be so vocal
in our celebration.

23:34.755 --> 23:38.672
We must remember,
not all can bask under God's glory

23:39.713 --> 23:43.005
I bet you Ali did extremely well.

23:44.047 --> 23:46.797
-I bet the same.
-If the Prophet hadn't banned gambling...

23:46.880 --> 23:48.672
I would bet my entire house

23:48.755 --> 23:51.005
that Ali would have a higher score
than Luay.

23:57.713 --> 23:58.547
So...

23:59.505 --> 24:01.588
-Enlighten us, Ali.
-Come on, Ali. Tell us.

24:01.672 --> 24:03.922
-The suspense is tingling me.
-Let's hear it.

24:04.005 --> 24:06.588
There is no man alive
smarter than his father.

24:06.672 --> 24:07.630
Maybe only his son.

24:11.047 --> 24:12.338
I got 96 also.

24:15.297 --> 24:16.213
Point 4.

24:16.922 --> 24:18.255
I would have won a house.

24:40.630 --> 24:41.463
Baba.

24:41.922 --> 24:43.130
What is this I hear?

24:44.755 --> 24:47.297
What is this they are saying
at the mosque?

24:49.630 --> 24:51.547
Ninety-six point four.

24:54.255 --> 24:56.088
Praise be to God.

24:56.172 --> 24:58.130
Ninety-six point four!

24:58.547 --> 25:01.297
I was worried you'd struggle to get 90.

25:01.380 --> 25:03.505
All the years fighting in the war,

25:03.588 --> 25:06.505
dragging my family
from one hell to another...

25:06.588 --> 25:09.213
My dumb brother is a genius.

25:09.713 --> 25:12.755
My brother's a genius. A genius.

25:12.880 --> 25:14.838
My dumb brother's a genius.

25:14.922 --> 25:16.713
Handsome son.

25:16.797 --> 25:20.922
- You are too gorgeous to be a doctor.
- Yes? I'm with him now.

25:21.005 --> 25:22.630
Here's to rid the evil eye.

25:23.797 --> 25:24.630
Mum.

25:25.172 --> 25:29.172
We have also ordered a dozen sheep
from the abattoir, as an offering.

25:29.255 --> 25:30.672
Oh, no.

25:30.755 --> 25:32.963
I don't want the sheep to die
for no reason.

25:33.047 --> 25:34.797
-No reason?
-Free them instead.

25:34.880 --> 25:36.880
Wait until everyone hears back home.

25:36.963 --> 25:40.047
Hears that my son is finally a doctor.

25:40.130 --> 25:42.630
♪ Where's my brother, Ali?
You'll find him in the library♪

25:42.713 --> 25:45.213
- ♪ You'll find him in the library♪
- Guys, just one second.

25:45.297 --> 25:46.338
Please, be quiet.

25:46.422 --> 25:47.755
Be quiet!

25:49.338 --> 25:51.547
I don't want to make a big deal
out of this.

25:52.297 --> 25:54.547
You, no fuss. No fuss.

25:56.213 --> 25:59.672
The next student is Jamal Hilfi.

25:59.755 --> 26:00.963
Unbelievable, man.

26:01.047 --> 26:03.297
I thought you were as dumb as me.
I got 68,9.

26:03.588 --> 26:05.297
Your father must be over the moon.

26:05.380 --> 26:07.797
...accepted into the paramedic course.

26:12.338 --> 26:17.505
Paramedic may sound like a fancy name
for nurses driving vans,

26:18.047 --> 26:23.255
but more important
is that we serve the Almighty Creator.

26:23.713 --> 26:26.088
Next to sit the entrance exam,

26:26.463 --> 26:30.005
this humble slave's very own son, Luay.

26:30.505 --> 26:32.838
A score of 96,2.

26:39.463 --> 26:43.672
And easily accepted into medicine
at Melbourne University.

26:48.338 --> 26:50.588
Luay, you are his holy seed.

26:50.672 --> 26:52.672
Next on the list is Ayoob Maithan.

26:53.505 --> 26:54.338
Oh dear.

26:55.922 --> 26:59.963
Ayoob... with a score of 68,9.

27:05.713 --> 27:07.088
No gift for you, Ayoob.

27:09.005 --> 27:11.797
Some of our sisters are on the list too,

27:11.880 --> 27:14.880
and one of them has achieved a...

27:15.047 --> 27:16.047
reasonable score.

27:16.130 --> 27:18.463
Indeed. 99,1.

27:18.880 --> 27:21.172
Wow. Mashallah. Praise be to God.

27:21.255 --> 27:25.130
She's also been accepted into medicine
at Melbourne University,

27:25.213 --> 27:28.380
and if her father is willing
to turn his back

27:28.463 --> 27:30.297
from the way of the Prophet

27:30.380 --> 27:33.963
and let her go to the university
and mix with Westerners...

27:35.130 --> 27:37.130
I hear she wears ripped jeans.

27:37.213 --> 27:40.005
-And our revered cleric's son...
-My son is next. Get ready.

27:40.088 --> 27:42.422
...got a score of 96,4.

27:42.963 --> 27:45.797
Good on you, Ali,
and to everyone who succeeded.

27:48.463 --> 27:52.047
Congratulations to our sisters
on their scores.

27:52.130 --> 27:53.630
Notably, our top student.

27:53.713 --> 27:56.713
And if you were my daughter,
I would be very proud.

28:06.172 --> 28:07.505
Ali! Number one!

28:07.922 --> 28:09.380
He's a tiger!

28:09.547 --> 28:11.047
He's a wolf!

28:11.213 --> 28:12.255
He's a lion!

28:12.338 --> 28:13.380
A speech!

28:13.797 --> 28:15.130
Top student!

28:15.755 --> 28:18.213
Looking at your face is worship.

28:18.630 --> 28:22.005
The greatest son of the greatest cleric!

28:23.547 --> 28:26.005
Brothers and sisters...
Don't use the echo.

28:29.547 --> 28:30.880
Brothers and sisters.

28:31.547 --> 28:32.797
First of all,

28:33.463 --> 28:36.088
I must congratulate our sister,

28:36.297 --> 28:37.838
the true top student.

28:37.922 --> 28:40.047
-But you!
-You're a genius, bro.

28:40.422 --> 28:41.672
Brothers and sisters.

28:42.213 --> 28:44.880
Surely, we are all equal.

28:46.547 --> 28:49.213
There's a funny thing
that the English say.

28:49.297 --> 28:50.630
"You say potato,

28:50.713 --> 28:52.005
I say pot-ah-to."

28:52.213 --> 28:55.213
Let's say, for example, I got 96,4...

28:55.630 --> 28:58.172
or 68,5.

28:58.713 --> 28:59.838
That could never happen!

28:59.922 --> 29:01.505
I would have won a house!

29:05.755 --> 29:07.338
Brothers, what I mean is,

29:07.422 --> 29:09.797
I'd be the same person
standing before you today.

29:09.880 --> 29:10.797
Flesh and blood.

29:11.297 --> 29:13.338
My heart would still pump blood--

29:13.422 --> 29:16.713
Already he enlightens us

29:58.172 --> 29:59.463
-What?
-Apart from wealth.

29:59.547 --> 30:01.380
As a doctor, you will make great money.

30:01.463 --> 30:03.755
Forget it, I will sort it out.
Cleaning, I think.

30:03.880 --> 30:04.838
Ask him, father.

30:05.838 --> 30:06.672
Ali baba.

30:08.713 --> 30:10.630
We need a copy of your results.

30:10.713 --> 30:12.588
Not because we doubt you,

30:12.672 --> 30:16.463
but we want to frame it
and decorate the mosque with your glory.

30:29.130 --> 30:30.255
You failed, didn't you?

30:34.505 --> 30:36.088
I got 68,5.

30:41.755 --> 30:43.880
-You have to tell Dad.
-Are you crazy?

30:44.505 --> 30:46.005
It'll destroy the family.

30:46.088 --> 30:48.088
-Dad's reputation.
-Am I crazy?

30:48.172 --> 30:50.463
You just told
the biggest lie in the world.

30:50.547 --> 30:51.922
What were you thinking?

30:54.880 --> 30:56.380
I'm the smart one, like Dad.

30:56.463 --> 30:57.963
I'm going to be the doctor.

30:58.047 --> 31:00.130
You're the idiot
who has to sort this out.

31:13.047 --> 31:13.880
What was that?

31:14.338 --> 31:15.172
What?

31:25.463 --> 31:26.922
Come on. That all you've got?

31:40.838 --> 31:42.463
Hey. The queen.

31:43.505 --> 31:44.838
99,1, huh?

31:44.922 --> 31:46.797
Potato, pot-ah-to. What's in a score?

31:46.963 --> 31:47.797
Well done.

31:48.088 --> 31:50.047
See, I knew you were brilliant.

31:50.922 --> 31:52.338
You're our top student.

31:52.422 --> 31:53.922
-Really? You think that?
-Yeah.

31:54.005 --> 31:55.755
Well done and a million well dones.

31:55.838 --> 31:58.255
Hey, we're going to do medicine together.

31:58.463 --> 31:59.755
I won't be doing it.

32:00.213 --> 32:01.047
Why not?

32:03.213 --> 32:04.088
Your dad, right?

32:04.172 --> 32:07.713
I told him our community needed
a Muslim to look after our women, but...

32:07.797 --> 32:08.630
he won't move.

32:09.047 --> 32:10.047
Di, we've got to go.

32:10.130 --> 32:13.672
Look, he'd have a heart attack
if he found out I played basketball.

32:22.880 --> 32:23.922
You know, Charlie?

32:24.005 --> 32:28.047
You and your dad were the only ones
that congratulated me on my score.

32:28.755 --> 32:29.672
Come on, D.

32:36.463 --> 32:37.297
Dianne.

32:38.880 --> 32:39.713
Yeah?

32:41.172 --> 32:42.672
Yeah, I did that already.

32:47.088 --> 32:48.672
-How are you? Good?
-All right.

32:48.755 --> 32:50.213
Five potato cakes, thanks.

32:52.172 --> 32:53.672
How is our beloved cleric?

32:54.297 --> 32:55.880
He's starting to get the aches,

32:55.963 --> 32:58.088
but as soon as I'm a doctor, I'll fix him.

32:58.172 --> 32:59.963
Perhaps you will fix me too?

33:00.047 --> 33:02.422
My shoulder, my knee...
You don't want to know.

33:02.505 --> 33:05.255
Yeah, and Western doctors
don't understand the Arab body.

33:05.338 --> 33:06.255
They know nothing.

33:07.505 --> 33:09.047
Stop bowling wides.

33:10.213 --> 33:11.547
How many runs are we chasing?

33:15.130 --> 33:17.047
Do you have a doctor in the family?

33:20.588 --> 33:22.463
Only my wife's family in Mesr.

33:23.338 --> 33:24.297
In Egypt.

33:26.005 --> 33:27.505
Rest her soul.

33:28.338 --> 33:29.172
And here...

33:29.672 --> 33:30.880
I only have my daughter.

33:31.255 --> 33:33.380
Then you need to find someone.

33:33.463 --> 33:34.297
Urgent.

33:34.380 --> 33:35.255
My Uncle Adnan...

33:35.338 --> 33:38.172
He was written off
by every Western doctor in the country,

33:38.255 --> 33:40.213
but praise be to God,

33:40.297 --> 33:42.130
his niece devoted her life to him.

33:42.213 --> 33:43.672
She studied medicine...

33:44.463 --> 33:45.755
Now, you should see him.

33:46.130 --> 33:48.630
He's a tennis coach, fit like a bull.

33:49.172 --> 33:53.422
LBW. Useless.
Bloody bludger and useless.

33:53.505 --> 33:54.338
Ali.

33:58.880 --> 34:00.713
You know the universities here.

34:02.130 --> 34:03.505
How do they say...

34:05.005 --> 34:06.047
Horny boys.

34:09.255 --> 34:10.297
You understand?

34:11.713 --> 34:13.005
I'll be going to the same uni.

34:13.713 --> 34:16.963
I could watch out for her.
Tell you if I see anything.

34:27.213 --> 34:28.047
Ali.

34:30.005 --> 34:31.088
Your potato cakes.

34:32.963 --> 34:34.463
Do you want chicken salt?

34:38.755 --> 34:39.588
So...

34:39.963 --> 34:42.922
My mother relocated
from Basra to Najaf?

34:43.380 --> 34:44.213
To Najaf?

34:45.505 --> 34:46.338
No?

34:48.880 --> 34:50.505
-To Baghdad.
-To Baghdad.

34:51.713 --> 34:53.172
-What's he saying?
-That's why.

34:53.255 --> 34:55.713
Is Faiq going to see her,
or is he sending someone?

34:55.797 --> 34:57.380
My mother is in Baghdad, where?

34:57.463 --> 34:58.922
Get him to hire a car and drive.

34:59.005 --> 35:00.380
-Say again.
-It's only 500.

35:00.463 --> 35:02.588
I can hardly hear you.
Please, say it again.

35:02.672 --> 35:05.172
Ali, cut the noise.
Your father can't hear anything.

35:05.255 --> 35:06.797
Om Hassan, I can't hear anything

35:06.880 --> 35:09.255
because I have a mad woman
standing next to me.

35:09.338 --> 35:10.463
-Talk.
-Faiq?

35:11.713 --> 35:12.547
Hello?

35:13.630 --> 35:14.463
Hello?

35:15.255 --> 35:16.213
Hello?

35:16.297 --> 35:17.255
I lost the line.

35:21.672 --> 35:22.505
Try again.

35:23.713 --> 35:25.047
Dad, maybe I should drive.

35:25.380 --> 35:27.797
It has a sport gearbox
and an unusual clutch.

35:28.297 --> 35:29.255
Turn right here.

35:29.713 --> 35:31.130
Dad, I have to tell you.

35:31.630 --> 35:32.463
I'm not as...

35:32.880 --> 35:36.005
-I'm not as clever as everybody thinks.
-I apologize!

35:36.755 --> 35:38.838
I didn't know you owned the road.

35:39.880 --> 35:41.922
This has been the week from God.

35:42.588 --> 35:45.297
My mother is alive,
the play will begin soon,

35:45.380 --> 35:47.588
and you are to be a doctor.

35:47.672 --> 35:49.547
No, Dad. What I meant...

35:49.630 --> 35:51.422
Dad, can you get out of first?

35:51.755 --> 35:53.713
No, we are here.

35:55.588 --> 35:57.797
Give Barbie back her car, you wanker.

35:57.880 --> 35:59.338
Good on you, mate.

35:59.463 --> 36:01.922
If only God would let me
raise it back at you.

36:02.297 --> 36:05.172
Dad, the mechanic's back that way.
What are we doing here?

36:05.255 --> 36:07.422
There are many paths in life, Ali.

36:07.588 --> 36:08.672
Sheikhna.

36:09.505 --> 36:11.380
-Hajjina.
-Wow.

36:16.255 --> 36:18.713
-What a surprise.
-A surprise indeed.

36:18.797 --> 36:20.630
You know our daughter, Yomna.

36:21.463 --> 36:23.463
She is, as you describe her...

36:23.547 --> 36:25.338
The pride of your eye.

36:26.005 --> 36:27.755
This is the doctor in the flesh.

36:28.338 --> 36:29.172
Say hello.

36:31.005 --> 36:31.838
Hello.

36:33.172 --> 36:34.005
G'day.

36:35.255 --> 36:37.380
Dad, you're in a "No Standing" zone.

36:37.588 --> 36:38.422
We are sitting.

36:38.963 --> 36:40.588
-Sheikhna.
-Hajjina.

36:42.630 --> 36:44.422
I'll see you at training, Ali.

36:46.005 --> 36:46.838
Wow.

36:48.505 --> 36:50.422
She's nice, don't you think?

36:51.422 --> 36:53.088
I don't know, Dad. Probably.

36:53.880 --> 36:54.713
Yeah.

36:57.422 --> 36:58.755
What did I press here?

37:25.880 --> 37:26.713
Where's Dad?

37:27.463 --> 37:28.880
-I have to speak to him.
-No.

37:29.005 --> 37:31.130
-I have to tell him the truth.
-Ali, no.

37:31.213 --> 37:32.088
Hey, Dad.

37:33.963 --> 37:36.213
He's just learned his mother has died.

37:40.588 --> 37:41.422
Oh, Dad.

37:42.880 --> 37:44.255
She had a heart attack.

37:45.963 --> 37:48.672
It would have been nice
if she knew I was still alive.

37:48.755 --> 37:50.880
She knew. I'm sure she knew.

37:52.172 --> 37:54.172
Come, let's give your father some space.

37:56.713 --> 37:58.088
That really sucks, Dad.

38:05.422 --> 38:08.505
To God we belong and to Him we return.

38:19.547 --> 38:22.297
She would have been so proud of you, son.

38:49.380 --> 38:52.213
-You're seriously doing this?
-I can make this work.

38:52.922 --> 38:55.297
I'll sit in all the lectures,
study for a year,

38:55.380 --> 38:57.338
resit the exam fully prepared.

38:58.380 --> 38:59.380
You're an idiot.

39:05.422 --> 39:06.255
Baba Ali.

39:09.672 --> 39:11.005
Let the journey begin.

39:12.463 --> 39:14.505
Go and return with health my son.

39:18.338 --> 39:20.047
Yeah, lots of healthy shit, bro.

39:21.172 --> 39:22.005
Good luck.

39:24.172 --> 39:25.005
Thanks, guys.

39:59.922 --> 40:00.838
Hello, Charlie.

40:02.922 --> 40:03.755
The queen.

40:04.672 --> 40:06.213
All hail. You made it.

40:06.838 --> 40:08.172
I wanted to thank you.

40:10.047 --> 40:11.505
It's because of you I'm here.

40:11.588 --> 40:14.838
Every Arab man has a medical condition
he wants looked into.

40:14.922 --> 40:17.880
Mind you, I have to find a cure
for arthritis by the end of the year.

40:17.963 --> 40:18.797
No pressure.

40:20.755 --> 40:22.505
I should go in.

40:24.547 --> 40:25.380
Ali.

40:28.713 --> 40:29.547
Luay.

40:30.713 --> 40:31.547
Shall we?

40:33.255 --> 40:34.088
We shall.

40:35.630 --> 40:38.672
The plasmalemma,
otherwise termed the cell membrane,

40:38.755 --> 40:42.005
is composed of phospholipids, proteins,

40:42.088 --> 40:44.338
glycolipids, and cholesterol.

40:44.797 --> 40:48.338
The plasmalemma
is called the phospholipid bilayer

40:48.880 --> 40:51.547
because its phospholipids
have two distinct layers,

40:52.672 --> 40:56.297
and the molecules lie
so that the heads are at the surface

40:56.380 --> 40:58.297
and the tails are on the inside.

41:24.880 --> 41:25.713
Very good.

41:26.838 --> 41:29.547
I think we need to make
the dance less suggestive.

41:29.630 --> 41:31.630
Can I speak with the Baathists, please?

41:31.713 --> 41:34.130
Sheikhna, should I shave the beard?

41:35.547 --> 41:38.380
Allahu Akbar. I am Saddam...

41:38.713 --> 41:39.547
Ali.

41:41.713 --> 41:44.297
So what did you think of today's...

41:45.463 --> 41:48.047
immunoglobulin genetic diversity lecture?

41:48.463 --> 41:50.463
I found it...

41:52.047 --> 41:52.880
intense.

41:56.297 --> 41:58.172
You know, we might...

41:58.588 --> 42:00.547
travel to uni together sometimes?

42:00.630 --> 42:01.547
Swap notes?

42:02.838 --> 42:03.672
Great.

42:03.838 --> 42:04.755
Test each other.

42:06.713 --> 42:07.547
Great.

42:15.797 --> 42:16.630
Thank you.

42:30.630 --> 42:31.463
After you.

42:31.588 --> 42:33.213
No, after you.

42:33.297 --> 42:34.713
But, you're to my right.

42:36.213 --> 42:37.588
Now you're to my right.

42:37.672 --> 42:38.755
But, you...

42:40.130 --> 42:42.505
You two dancing, or are you in this tute?

42:43.463 --> 42:44.297
Yeah.

42:45.255 --> 42:47.297
No, they swapped me over into this so...

42:56.588 --> 42:59.505
I am looking for my son, the doctor.
Ali Albasri.

42:59.588 --> 43:00.422
Call him for me.

43:02.213 --> 43:05.463
You know how we've been talking,
student to student?

43:06.130 --> 43:10.297
I thought maybe we could talk
male to female, you know? Speak speak.

43:10.922 --> 43:13.255
I mean, not now, but when you're ready.

43:14.422 --> 43:16.463
How would you know when I'm ready?

43:17.963 --> 43:18.797
Morning all.

43:19.005 --> 43:19.963
Morning.

43:20.047 --> 43:20.880
Right, everyone.

43:21.380 --> 43:23.838
-Alicia, here, is Patient X.
-Hi.

43:23.922 --> 43:27.172
I need a volunteer
to take her case history.

43:27.797 --> 43:28.797
You. Briefcase.

43:30.047 --> 43:31.588
Your face is not familiar.

43:33.463 --> 43:35.172
Yeah, I was swapped over.

43:36.380 --> 43:37.213
Ali.

43:38.630 --> 43:40.088
OK, Ali. Come down.

43:44.630 --> 43:48.422
This is a 26-year-old female

43:48.505 --> 43:50.255
who comes into the GP Clinic.

43:51.380 --> 43:53.922
You're a second-year GP intern.

43:54.880 --> 43:55.963
Take her history.

43:56.047 --> 43:58.088
-So, I'm the doctor?
-You're the doctor.

44:00.880 --> 44:03.088
-Good afternoon, Alicia.
-Afternoon.

44:03.172 --> 44:05.005
Thanks for coming to my clinic.

44:06.297 --> 44:08.922
What seems to be the problem
this afternoon?

44:09.547 --> 44:11.505
I have a really weird discharge.

44:14.797 --> 44:15.630
Huh.

44:16.297 --> 44:17.422
That's no good.

44:19.797 --> 44:20.630
Not good.

44:21.713 --> 44:25.338
What do you mean, he's not on the list?
He was first at the mosque to get in.

44:25.422 --> 44:28.005
-I'll find him myself.
-Sorry, you can't go in there.

44:28.088 --> 44:30.047
So with the discharge,

44:30.130 --> 44:33.547
did you see it first,
smell it, or hear it?

44:34.588 --> 44:36.422
I saw it, and then I smelled it,

44:36.505 --> 44:37.838
but it didn't make a noise.

44:39.672 --> 44:41.005
Come.

44:41.505 --> 44:42.463
Oh, shit.

44:42.547 --> 44:46.380
No wonder we couldn't find him.
He is operating. See?

44:47.255 --> 44:49.047
These people say they don't know you.

44:49.255 --> 44:51.922
-Is this your teacher?
-Sorry. Family emergency.

44:52.005 --> 44:54.630
-Is he a good teacher?
-He's one of the greats, Mum.

44:54.755 --> 44:56.547
OK. Back up here.

44:56.755 --> 44:58.672
Our two families are having tea.

44:58.963 --> 45:00.255
You need to dress up.

45:05.130 --> 45:07.297
Hello, Ayoob? Hey, bro.

45:07.922 --> 45:11.088
With this tea ceremony,
what do I do not to get married?

45:11.172 --> 45:12.630
Spoon in? Spoon out?

45:12.713 --> 45:14.630
Do I drink the tea? Not drink the tea?

45:14.713 --> 45:16.713
Relax... but listen carefully.

45:16.797 --> 45:18.505
So, you grab the sugar.

45:19.047 --> 45:22.297
-I thought ours didn't have the sugar?
-No, it does. Oh, wait...

45:23.047 --> 45:24.963
Look, forget the sugar for the moment.

45:25.047 --> 45:28.213
The most important thing
is when you drink the tea...

45:28.297 --> 45:31.338
-OK, so when do I drink the tea?
-Unbelievable, man.

45:31.422 --> 45:33.088
Ayoob?

45:33.797 --> 45:37.547
If you don't want to get married, Ali...
Oh my--

45:37.630 --> 45:39.047
When do I drink the tea?

45:39.922 --> 45:41.755
No!

45:43.422 --> 45:45.213
Don't operate until I see her.

45:56.755 --> 45:58.005
And how is the play?

45:58.463 --> 45:59.297
Oh, excellent.

45:59.672 --> 46:01.463
My Ali is very gifted.

46:01.547 --> 46:04.713
Although his primary concern,
as you have witnessed firsthand,

46:04.797 --> 46:06.713
is to be a great surgeon one day.

46:06.797 --> 46:09.088
-That is so balanced of him.
-Indeed.

46:09.422 --> 46:11.005
He plays five instruments.

46:11.463 --> 46:12.297
I must say,

46:12.380 --> 46:15.297
I never thought of Saddam Hussein
as being this handsome.

46:15.380 --> 46:17.213
Really, it was an issue.

46:17.297 --> 46:20.630
Saddam was an ugly, fat man,
and my boy, well...

46:21.130 --> 46:23.088
-You can see with your eyes.
-Indeed.

46:23.672 --> 46:24.630
My own daughter.

46:24.880 --> 46:28.255
I wish she could hide her beauty
behind a false mustache.

46:30.172 --> 46:31.797
Speaking of my angel.

46:33.838 --> 46:35.880
-She is beautiful.
-Of course.

46:37.213 --> 46:38.047
Sheikhna.

46:38.463 --> 46:40.005
Please, try my baklava.

46:53.172 --> 46:54.547
Thank you, Yomna.

48:23.088 --> 48:25.713
He drinks the tea,
before I have given my approval.

48:28.880 --> 48:30.547
The boy is so eager to marry.

48:30.630 --> 48:31.713
It is done.

48:37.922 --> 48:40.797
My doctor son is engaged.

48:48.130 --> 48:50.505
Very unorthodox with the sugar business,

48:51.172 --> 48:52.005
but we are here.

49:01.172 --> 49:04.213
A thousand blessings
on our newly engaged couple.

49:04.630 --> 49:06.630
Two faiths, under one roof.

49:15.588 --> 49:16.422
You are quiet.

49:17.047 --> 49:18.880
Our son is speechless with joy.

49:19.380 --> 49:21.172
I will call everybody tonight.

49:21.838 --> 49:22.922
You liked the tea?

49:23.755 --> 49:24.588
It was tea.

49:25.005 --> 49:28.588
That will show all those women
who thought you would be single forever.

49:28.672 --> 49:29.505
Or worse.

49:31.630 --> 49:32.588
It's my degree.

49:32.672 --> 49:35.255
How can I be a proper husband
when I'm studying?

49:35.338 --> 49:38.547
You father fought in a war,
studied for two decades,

49:38.630 --> 49:40.588
and fathered four children
all at once.

49:40.672 --> 49:42.588
Mom, I'm not as good as Dad.
I need to focus.

49:42.672 --> 49:45.380
Maybe he is right.
After all, this is Australia.

49:45.463 --> 49:47.838
People only do one thing at a time.

49:48.588 --> 49:51.880
Perhaps I could convince Haj Karim
and the other witnesses

49:51.963 --> 49:53.588
to hold off the announcement.

49:53.672 --> 49:55.880
Maybe the end of your first year
is better.

49:57.088 --> 49:58.588
And you, no calls.

49:59.505 --> 50:00.672
Just three calls.

50:01.380 --> 50:02.922
No, not even half a call.

50:17.838 --> 50:18.838
Woman.

50:19.838 --> 50:22.422
The son of the cleric
says he's in tutorials with you.

50:22.505 --> 50:23.630
My name's Dianne.

50:23.713 --> 50:24.547
Is it true?

50:25.338 --> 50:28.047
Completely. My name is Dianne, see?

50:30.088 --> 50:31.338
Is it true, Dianne?

50:32.130 --> 50:35.797
-What, you want 100 points of ID?
-Is it true he's in tutorials with you?

50:37.047 --> 50:38.422
He. You mean Ali?

50:40.255 --> 50:41.713
What do you have against him?

50:43.672 --> 50:45.338
I have worked...

50:46.255 --> 50:48.338
day and night to get where I am.

50:49.255 --> 50:50.505
I deserve to be here.

50:51.380 --> 50:54.630
I don't like to see the son of the cleric
getting an easy ride.

50:56.047 --> 50:57.422
He's not a good Muslim.

50:57.922 --> 50:59.172
You should know that.

50:59.713 --> 51:01.255
So, I will ask you again...

51:01.963 --> 51:04.338
is he in tutorials with you,
as he says he is?

51:05.297 --> 51:06.130
Dianne.

51:07.880 --> 51:09.755
Yeah, he comes to every session.

51:10.463 --> 51:13.755
And he's the second smartest student
in my class, Luay.

51:27.838 --> 51:31.130
Why did you do the "potato pot-ah-to"
speech at the mosque?

51:34.213 --> 51:36.088
It was a spontaneous speech.

51:40.422 --> 51:42.255
You didn't get 96,4, did you?

51:48.463 --> 51:50.963
-It's complicated.
-What are you doing here?

51:51.213 --> 51:54.172
I'm doing the study, just... not enrolled.

51:54.588 --> 51:57.380
What, so in six years you're gonna
become a pretend doctor,

51:57.463 --> 51:58.797
and treat pretend patients?

51:58.880 --> 52:01.088
The Prophet said it's not the end result,

52:01.172 --> 52:02.463
it's the intention.

52:03.380 --> 52:04.672
I'm doing it for my dad.

52:04.755 --> 52:07.005
You of all people
should know what it's like.

52:07.297 --> 52:10.880
Dianne, ever since I was a kid,
I was introduced as Doctor Ali this,

52:10.963 --> 52:12.047
and Surgeon Ali that.

52:12.130 --> 52:14.463
I didn't have the guts to tell him
I was Moron Ali,

52:14.547 --> 52:16.213
and now I have to carry this.

52:16.297 --> 52:18.255
-A briefcase?
-It's my older brother's.

52:18.338 --> 52:19.547
He was the smart one.

52:19.630 --> 52:21.505
He should have been the great surgeon,

52:21.588 --> 52:24.297
but instead he had to go
and step on a fucking landmine.

52:33.422 --> 52:34.755
You know what? It's...

52:35.588 --> 52:36.588
It's my problem.

52:37.297 --> 52:40.047
I won't bother you with it again...

53:15.213 --> 53:16.297
We're out of milk.

53:17.047 --> 53:18.797
How about the 100 Chupa Chups?

53:26.047 --> 53:28.213
Charlie, do you even want to do medicine?

53:30.588 --> 53:31.713
It doesn't matter now.

53:35.297 --> 53:37.297
But, yes, I'd like to help people.

53:49.838 --> 53:50.797
I'll help you.

53:54.880 --> 53:56.130
You helped me get in.

53:57.005 --> 53:58.255
I'll help you get in.

54:00.588 --> 54:03.463
What's the most common disorder
of the autonomic nervous system

54:03.547 --> 54:05.505
that can impede systemic circulation?

54:05.963 --> 54:08.838
-I know it's not good.
-Great. What's it responsible for?

54:09.713 --> 54:10.547
The heart?

54:11.463 --> 54:15.422
Ali, the hardest thing in the world for me
has been getting in. I can't waste time.

54:15.505 --> 54:17.797
Tell me when you've studied it properly.

54:21.422 --> 54:23.255
One of the most common disorders

54:23.338 --> 54:26.880
is the long-standing diabetic damage
to the autonomic nerves.

54:26.963 --> 54:28.088
They call it the...

54:29.005 --> 54:30.963
diabetic autonomic neuropathy.

54:31.047 --> 54:34.297
Give me the physiology of what happens
to your cardiovascular system

54:34.380 --> 54:35.422
out of a warm bed.

54:36.755 --> 54:38.213
Give me to lunchtime.

54:40.130 --> 54:42.338
Your blood pressure would drop
immediately,

54:42.422 --> 54:46.047
and your heart would contract
and beat more rapidly and vigorously,

54:46.130 --> 54:48.213
as your arteries increase their tone,

54:48.297 --> 54:50.463
and then your blood pressure recovers.

54:51.838 --> 54:53.797
Like everyday when I see you.

55:00.213 --> 55:01.672
No, Dianne. I'm sorry.

55:05.255 --> 55:08.172
-Were you talking to her?
-Yeah, about the last lecture.

55:08.255 --> 55:09.922
Oh, the causes of cirrhosis?

55:10.380 --> 55:13.005
-What were they again?
-Why? Weren't you listening?

55:13.088 --> 55:15.713
Alcohol abuse, viruses, Hep A, B, C...

55:17.130 --> 55:19.255
No, not A, just B and C.

55:20.713 --> 55:22.505
I'm really sorry. That was wrong.

55:22.588 --> 55:24.338
I can't study with you tonight.

55:24.797 --> 55:25.713
I understand.

55:27.672 --> 55:30.130
I'm going to a film
with my basketball team.

55:31.505 --> 55:33.880
At 8:30. The Dorset Cinema.

56:15.588 --> 56:16.422
Mum.

56:16.713 --> 56:18.922
There's this girl at the mosque.
Quite pious.

56:19.005 --> 56:22.088
-She's also doing medicine.
-The chick with the English name?

56:22.172 --> 56:24.297
-Dianne, she's really nice.
-The Lebanese one.

56:24.380 --> 56:27.213
-I think her mum's Egyptian or something.
-Not Iraqi?

56:27.297 --> 56:29.088
I see her at uni sometimes--

56:29.172 --> 56:33.088
Yes, they say her father doesn't approve,
but she seems nice enough.

56:33.172 --> 56:34.088
Listen habibi.

56:34.172 --> 56:37.047
Layal, her son went to school
with Rami and Momtaz.

56:37.130 --> 56:39.713
She has a sinus problem.
I said you'd check it out.

56:39.797 --> 56:42.297
-What? I'm not a doctor yet.
-You're as good as one.

56:42.380 --> 56:44.422
Dianne's going to be a doctor.
She could--

56:44.505 --> 56:47.713
So, the antenna guy quotes us 200 bucks
to put up the aerial.

56:47.797 --> 56:49.338
You know what I told him?

56:49.672 --> 56:52.880
You're just assuming I tell him
to shove it up his ass? Anyway.

56:52.963 --> 56:56.005
I'll put up the aerial myself,
save you guys some cashola.

56:56.547 --> 56:59.088
-You are the muscles of this family.
-Thank you.

56:59.172 --> 57:00.755
Brains. Muscles.

57:00.838 --> 57:02.588
I have all the children I need.

57:02.672 --> 57:04.922
And my fee... Let's call it 100 bucks.

57:05.547 --> 57:07.797
-A hundred bucks.
-You'd be up 100 buckaroos.

57:07.880 --> 57:09.297
Give him $50.

57:09.380 --> 57:12.630
-One day I'll be out of this house.
-Dianne's surprisingly devout.

57:12.713 --> 57:14.505
She was born here, wasn't she?

57:15.047 --> 57:18.172
Yeah, but doesn't the Koran say
we're all children of one earth?

57:18.255 --> 57:19.922
Yes, but...

57:20.463 --> 57:23.755
The Koran was written
before Australia was discovered

57:23.838 --> 57:26.380
and the Prophet didn't know about
the beaches here.

57:26.463 --> 57:28.713
You know the rumors
about girls born here.

57:28.797 --> 57:30.005
I was born here.

57:30.922 --> 57:33.922
Your sister.
She has seen things beyond her age.

57:34.005 --> 57:37.963
Men, in bathers. People kissing on TV.

57:38.047 --> 57:39.380
I can still hear you.

57:39.463 --> 57:41.088
-Mohammed!
-Yeah, Mum.

57:41.172 --> 57:43.588
Get your sister
to help you with the antenna.

57:43.672 --> 57:45.630
I'm not going on the roof
with that lunatic.

57:45.713 --> 57:46.922
Mum, Dianne's different.

57:47.005 --> 57:48.672
Ali, habibi.

57:49.005 --> 57:51.672
Girls brought up here
are like our dishwasher.

57:51.838 --> 57:53.922
We thought we were buying it brand new,

57:54.005 --> 57:55.380
until we found out...

57:55.463 --> 57:57.130
it was a floor model.

57:57.630 --> 57:59.880
And she is not right for your brother.

58:00.380 --> 58:01.213
For Moe?

58:01.297 --> 58:03.505
Enough. She's Lebanese.

58:05.588 --> 58:06.797
Ramona, get up here.

58:08.297 --> 58:09.713
You call yourself fit?

58:10.255 --> 58:13.463
If I was the coach, I'd get you all
to strip naked in the desert

58:13.547 --> 58:14.755
and run like donkeys.

58:16.338 --> 58:17.713
What are you doing?

58:20.338 --> 58:21.255
I've got to go.

58:22.130 --> 58:23.463
I've got to study.

58:23.880 --> 58:25.922
The oil in the fryer needs changing.

58:26.005 --> 58:27.213
We never change it.

58:27.880 --> 58:29.588
Customers need to be served.

58:29.922 --> 58:32.963
If I change the oil now,
and serve all night, can I go?

58:35.005 --> 58:36.713
Please. I'll be back by eight.

58:37.672 --> 58:39.297
I'll make you Mum's tagine.

58:40.922 --> 58:41.755
Yeah?

58:42.422 --> 58:44.380
Everything now and back by seven.

58:44.755 --> 58:45.713
Thank you.

58:45.797 --> 58:46.922
I love you, Dad.

58:47.547 --> 58:48.463
No smoking.

58:48.880 --> 58:49.713
I know.

58:51.422 --> 58:52.380
God help me.

58:54.838 --> 58:57.963
I could never tell my Dad we speak speak,
could you?

58:58.797 --> 59:00.630
Mum's funny about the Lebanese.

59:00.838 --> 59:04.588
My dad thinks Iraqis are the source
of all the misery in the Middle East.

59:05.255 --> 59:06.088
Oh.

59:06.963 --> 59:10.172
My mum just reckons
you guys ruin Middle Eastern food.

59:12.255 --> 59:13.755
I don't know what I want.

59:19.213 --> 59:20.047
I do.

59:26.047 --> 59:27.422
It's so beautiful here.

59:32.755 --> 59:35.713
You know, this is as much
as we can ever do.

59:38.630 --> 59:39.463
Yes, I know.

01:00:05.755 --> 01:00:08.213
Leave them be. They are young.

01:00:08.588 --> 01:00:11.213
Let his hands wander
as long as seed is not spilled.

01:00:16.880 --> 01:00:18.338
Good. Apart.

01:00:18.880 --> 01:00:20.797
We're a very modern family here.

01:00:21.672 --> 01:00:23.713
I'll be downstairs if you need...

01:00:25.755 --> 01:00:28.172
Are you trying to give me diabetes?

01:00:29.338 --> 01:00:32.172
-I heard you have a sweet tooth.
-I don't have a sweet tooth.

01:00:32.255 --> 01:00:34.422
How many children do you want?

01:00:34.963 --> 01:00:36.922
As many as makes you happy.

01:00:37.713 --> 01:00:39.172
Good. Then none.

01:00:40.797 --> 01:00:41.672
What? Really?

01:00:42.463 --> 01:00:43.380
I hate children.

01:00:45.255 --> 01:00:46.547
They can be annoying.

01:00:47.088 --> 01:00:50.047
They cost too much.
So many nappies. Disgusting.

01:00:50.130 --> 01:00:51.047
And you know what?

01:00:51.130 --> 01:00:53.838
I think I might give up medicine.

01:00:54.213 --> 01:00:56.172
Just sit and watch TV all day.

01:00:56.630 --> 01:00:57.463
Cricket.

01:00:57.963 --> 01:00:58.922
Test match cricket.

01:01:00.172 --> 01:01:03.422
Also, I'm going to eat and get fat.

01:01:03.505 --> 01:01:06.213
And I mean reality-show fat.

01:01:07.255 --> 01:01:10.172
Well, as long as you're comfortable,
I will be too.

01:01:10.672 --> 01:01:14.672
Rings from the finest jewelers,

01:01:15.047 --> 01:01:17.755
our gold plucked from the desert sands--

01:01:17.838 --> 01:01:18.963
Too expensive.

01:01:23.088 --> 01:01:26.463
I forget you are but a student,
saving for the future.

01:01:34.963 --> 01:01:36.797
What are you trying to tell me, Ali?

01:01:43.630 --> 01:01:44.463
Two.

01:01:47.422 --> 01:01:48.547
I'd want two kids.

01:01:50.713 --> 01:01:51.755
At least.

01:01:53.005 --> 01:01:54.797
And three sugars.

01:01:55.838 --> 01:01:57.922
So this chick you're saddled with?

01:01:58.797 --> 01:02:00.713
-She's a dog?
-No.

01:02:01.213 --> 01:02:03.422
She's beautiful. Nice, too.

01:02:03.505 --> 01:02:06.172
-I'm struggling to see the problem.
-She's not the one.

01:02:06.255 --> 01:02:08.588
Well then, who is? Not that medical chick?

01:02:10.088 --> 01:02:12.797
Unbelievable, man.
How could you keep this from us?

01:02:12.880 --> 01:02:14.130
-You animal.
-It's weird.

01:02:14.463 --> 01:02:16.922
When I'm with Dianne,
I feel like I'm me, you know?

01:02:17.005 --> 01:02:18.630
It's weird because you're engaged.

01:02:18.713 --> 01:02:20.713
You can't be seen together
or speak to her.

01:02:20.963 --> 01:02:23.338
-Does Dianne know you're engaged?
-Of course not.

01:02:23.422 --> 01:02:25.130
-Call off the engagement.
-I can't.

01:02:25.213 --> 01:02:27.588
-What would people say? Your father?
-I know.

01:02:27.672 --> 01:02:29.130
Moussa’s mum, remember?

01:02:29.213 --> 01:02:31.213
Two weeks in hospital
after he called it off.

01:02:31.297 --> 01:02:34.297
-Double unbelievable.
-Can't you guys have, like, 72 wives?

01:02:35.463 --> 01:02:39.380
♪ They think they can beat him
They lie to themselves♪

01:02:39.547 --> 01:02:43.088
♪ While they try to bomb him
He plays with our girls♪

01:02:43.172 --> 01:02:46.463
♪ While Iraq burns
He plays with two girls♪

01:02:47.297 --> 01:02:48.213
Forgot your gun.

01:02:48.297 --> 01:02:49.380
Only two?

01:02:49.630 --> 01:02:51.922
You know how many wives
Saddam actually had?

01:02:52.463 --> 01:02:53.297
More than you?

01:02:53.380 --> 01:02:56.505
1,300. Temporary marriages, of course.

01:02:56.588 --> 01:02:59.005
-Are temporary marriages even real?
-Of course!

01:02:59.672 --> 01:03:04.630
I spent my teenage years
studying Koranic jurisprudence.

01:03:05.130 --> 01:03:06.630
Some you marry for one hour,

01:03:06.713 --> 01:03:08.505
some for a day,

01:03:08.588 --> 01:03:11.547
and the ones with stamina, like a taxi...

01:03:12.755 --> 01:03:13.963
you leave the meter on.

01:03:14.047 --> 01:03:15.713
Cue Saddam Hussein.

01:03:16.672 --> 01:03:18.755
If temporary marriages were real,

01:03:19.130 --> 01:03:20.755
why don't all Muslims do it?

01:03:20.880 --> 01:03:24.338
They don't know Islamic laws like I do.

01:03:25.588 --> 01:03:26.963
There is always a loophole.

01:03:27.047 --> 01:03:29.213
Cue Saddam Hussein 20 minutes ago.

01:03:38.838 --> 01:03:40.588
What are you doing here? Go away.

01:03:40.672 --> 01:03:42.588
I found a way we can be together.

01:03:42.963 --> 01:03:44.130
Temporary marriage.

01:03:44.713 --> 01:03:47.297
Temporary marriage?
You came here just to say that?

01:03:47.380 --> 01:03:49.672
Come on.
That's just a loophole for horny Arabs.

01:03:49.755 --> 01:03:51.838
Yeah, but it's written law.

01:03:52.213 --> 01:03:54.463
"A man who desireth temporary marriage,

01:03:54.547 --> 01:03:57.838
must first set a reasonable time limit,
reasonable dowry,

01:03:57.922 --> 01:03:59.713
treat the woman with dignity..."

01:03:59.797 --> 01:04:00.797
I'm all about that.

01:04:01.213 --> 01:04:03.547
It's not in the Koran.
It's not in the text.

01:04:03.630 --> 01:04:04.713
Yeah, but it's here.

01:04:04.797 --> 01:04:07.088
It means
we can have a proper relationship.

01:04:07.672 --> 01:04:09.213
But, you know? Temporary.

01:04:09.588 --> 01:04:10.630
Like Australians.

01:04:10.838 --> 01:04:12.380
What are you two talking about?

01:04:12.463 --> 01:04:15.505
Your daughter's asking me
about a possible cure for arthritis.

01:04:15.838 --> 01:04:16.713
Yalla, OK.

01:04:20.963 --> 01:04:23.380
Jewell Station tomorrow at eleven o'clock.

01:04:23.463 --> 01:04:24.297
OK?

01:04:25.213 --> 01:04:26.838
Go. Go on.

01:04:45.338 --> 01:04:47.963
I haven't got long.
I'm supposed to be delivering these.

01:04:48.047 --> 01:04:49.005
How does this work?

01:04:50.088 --> 01:04:50.922
I don't know.

01:04:51.838 --> 01:04:55.088
But once we get married
we could... do things.

01:04:55.172 --> 01:04:56.713
I could say things to you.

01:04:57.297 --> 01:04:58.630
We can say things now.

01:04:58.963 --> 01:05:00.922
No, like when we're alone.

01:05:01.088 --> 01:05:02.255
I could say I like you,

01:05:02.338 --> 01:05:04.880
and if you felt like it,
you could say you like me.

01:05:04.963 --> 01:05:07.838
OK, apart from standing around
telling each other we like each other,

01:05:07.922 --> 01:05:09.130
what else can we do?

01:05:13.838 --> 01:05:15.088
We could go bowling.

01:05:17.338 --> 01:05:18.755
OK, we could go bowling.

01:05:20.088 --> 01:05:23.422
We could have ice cream together.
We could go to the aquarium.

01:05:23.588 --> 01:05:24.963
We could watch another movie.

01:05:25.047 --> 01:05:27.338
I could put my arm around your waist
this time.

01:05:27.422 --> 01:05:28.838
How long would we be married?

01:05:29.672 --> 01:05:30.922
Medicine's six years.

01:05:31.005 --> 01:05:33.797
-How about we start with six weeks?
-Sure. Great.

01:05:34.422 --> 01:05:35.255
OK.

01:05:36.422 --> 01:05:37.630
But no one can know.

01:05:37.797 --> 01:05:39.588
I think we need two witnesses.

01:05:47.047 --> 01:05:48.130
You look beautiful.

01:05:48.213 --> 01:05:50.380
OK, say your vows.
We're gonna catch the next train.

01:05:50.463 --> 01:05:51.713
OK. I, Ali Dianne...

01:05:53.005 --> 01:05:55.005
I, Ali Albasri, take Dianne Mohsen,

01:05:55.088 --> 01:05:57.713
to be my religiously lawfully wedded wife.

01:05:57.797 --> 01:06:00.130
-Her dowry being...
-The fish and chips will do.

01:06:00.213 --> 01:06:02.380
-Her dowry being 200 grams of snapper.
-Flake.

01:06:02.463 --> 01:06:04.797
-You don't want the snapper at our place.
-Quick.

01:06:05.130 --> 01:06:06.255
So, do you take me?

01:06:06.380 --> 01:06:07.213
I do.

01:06:07.588 --> 01:06:08.422
For six weeks.

01:06:09.297 --> 01:06:12.088
-We've witnessed this solemn proceeding.
-So, kiss her.

01:06:23.213 --> 01:06:25.463
We should give
this temporary marriage thing a go.

01:06:33.088 --> 01:06:36.797
I will never, ever be caught.

01:06:37.255 --> 01:06:38.338
Yeah!

01:06:38.963 --> 01:06:41.797

Master Saddam, the Americans crashed
through the gates. We must run.

01:07:06.922 --> 01:07:07.755
What happened?

01:07:08.547 --> 01:07:10.047
No!

01:07:10.130 --> 01:07:11.755
Allahu Akbar.

01:07:11.838 --> 01:07:13.380
Come on, Saddam.

01:07:13.963 --> 01:07:16.755
Nuke them with your might and power.

01:07:19.505 --> 01:07:22.463
There are no WMDs.

01:07:23.005 --> 01:07:25.047
I had to fake it...

01:07:25.380 --> 01:07:27.047

We're going to Broadway.

01:07:54.005 --> 01:07:55.838
Broadway? Unbelievable, man.

01:07:55.963 --> 01:07:56.797
No!

01:08:00.588 --> 01:08:02.255
No one said Broadway.

01:08:02.838 --> 01:08:05.422
It is the Bin Khattabi multipurpose hall.

01:08:05.838 --> 01:08:07.838
How does that even sound like Broadway?

01:08:07.922 --> 01:08:10.797
It is a Muslim community hall in Detroit.

01:08:10.880 --> 01:08:12.172
We're going to Detroit?

01:08:12.255 --> 01:08:14.880
-Detroit. Unbelievable, man.
-Yes.

01:08:15.588 --> 01:08:18.130
Our dear friend, Dr. Hasoon Albandar...

01:08:18.212 --> 01:08:21.755
He is the brother-in-law
to the Iraqi ambassador in the US.

01:08:22.380 --> 01:08:23.837
He saw the show and loved it.

01:08:23.921 --> 01:08:25.087
He made one phone call

01:08:25.171 --> 01:08:28.296
and we have been invited to perform it
live in Detroit

01:08:32.796 --> 01:08:37.587
Sheikhna, won't that mean we'll be serving
the devil regime of the USA?

01:08:38.587 --> 01:08:41.046
Luay will not be needed.
Principal cast only.

01:08:41.130 --> 01:08:44.296
So your conscience can remain guilt-free,
Seyyed.

01:08:47.212 --> 01:08:48.712
I'm not going to Detroit?

01:08:58.130 --> 01:08:59.255
Bro, the mustache.

01:09:18.921 --> 01:09:20.296
You've got your hair out.

01:09:20.380 --> 01:09:22.337
And you've got a stupid mustache.

01:09:22.421 --> 01:09:23.671
Oh yeah. Hey, listen.

01:09:23.962 --> 01:09:26.712
-I found a way for us to stay together.
-We are together.

01:09:26.796 --> 01:09:28.630
No, together together. Forever.

01:09:28.962 --> 01:09:30.671
The play's going to America.

01:09:30.755 --> 01:09:31.630
-What?
-Yeah.

01:09:31.712 --> 01:09:32.630
That's amazing.

01:09:33.046 --> 01:09:34.630
-You are so good.
-Really?

01:09:34.712 --> 01:09:35.796
I was really proud.

01:09:35.880 --> 01:09:38.130
This is God,
the author of destinies and will.

01:09:38.212 --> 01:09:40.712
He's talking to me.
He's laying out the path for us.

01:09:40.796 --> 01:09:43.130
-Slow down, Charlie.
-God wants me to disappear.

01:09:43.212 --> 01:09:46.087
In the States, I'm going to call Dad,
away from the mosque,

01:09:46.171 --> 01:09:47.337
away from the community.

01:09:47.421 --> 01:09:50.796
I'm gonna tell him the truth.
I'm gonna stay there and not come back.

01:09:50.880 --> 01:09:53.421
-I don't want you to go.
-No, hear me out.

01:09:53.505 --> 01:09:56.338
-I'll drop medicine--
-You were never doing medicine.

01:09:56.422 --> 01:09:58.505
I'm going to get work there, as an actor.

01:09:58.588 --> 01:10:01.463
Hollywood always needs people like us
to play terrorists.

01:10:01.672 --> 01:10:03.130
And then you can join me.

01:10:03.213 --> 01:10:04.630
You come over, we get married,

01:10:04.713 --> 01:10:06.922
and we stay there
until our parents forgive us.

01:10:07.005 --> 01:10:09.338
This sounds like one of your plans.
We can't just run away.

01:10:10.380 --> 01:10:13.380
-I'm not turning my back on medicine.
-No, you mustn't.

01:10:13.463 --> 01:10:15.963
There's great medical schools there.

01:10:21.880 --> 01:10:24.172
-This is insane.
-No, it's more than insane.

01:10:24.255 --> 01:10:26.338
But we're Muslim.
What other options have we got?

01:10:26.838 --> 01:10:28.755
In America we can live like Australians.

01:10:32.963 --> 01:10:35.255
Do you really want to be with me forever?

01:10:39.172 --> 01:10:40.172
Please don't.

01:10:41.172 --> 01:10:42.547
Please. Charlie...

01:10:42.797 --> 01:10:45.005
Dianne. I want to marry you.

01:10:46.297 --> 01:10:47.505
And not temporary.

01:10:47.963 --> 01:10:48.797
Shit.

01:10:48.880 --> 01:10:50.005
-What?
-Fish bone.

01:10:51.505 --> 01:10:52.338
Dianne.

01:10:53.130 --> 01:10:55.880
I've never known, ever,
what I've wanted, but...

01:10:56.963 --> 01:10:57.838
This I know.

01:10:59.380 --> 01:11:00.922
Don't you want to marry me?

01:11:01.005 --> 01:11:03.255
What have you done with my glasses?

01:11:03.338 --> 01:11:05.047
They'll be on his stupid head.

01:11:05.130 --> 01:11:06.797
Please, just think about it.

01:11:45.713 --> 01:11:47.713
I'll call you as soon as I've settled.

01:11:56.172 --> 01:11:57.588
Tell us one more time.

01:11:57.672 --> 01:11:59.588
We like hearing your Aussie accent.

01:11:59.672 --> 01:12:02.963
How many times do I have to tell you?
It's a musical, a comedy.

01:12:03.047 --> 01:12:05.047
It's a funny play about Saddam Hussein.

01:12:05.130 --> 01:12:07.588
-We don't tend to laugh at terrorism.
-Terrorism?

01:12:08.088 --> 01:12:09.213
It's on your phone.

01:12:13.255 --> 01:12:15.547
What have you guys planted on my phone?

01:12:15.838 --> 01:12:17.755
"We will come back and kill them."

01:12:20.255 --> 01:12:21.380
That's not mine.

01:12:22.422 --> 01:12:23.255
Your words.

01:12:24.713 --> 01:12:26.255
"I'll have front row seats."

01:12:27.755 --> 01:12:29.713
-What?
-"I will watch them suffer."

01:12:30.255 --> 01:12:34.255
"The bombers will slaughter you."
Should I keep reading this obscenity?

01:12:34.588 --> 01:12:35.588
Name the bombers.

01:12:36.463 --> 01:12:38.088
The Bombers.

01:12:38.838 --> 01:12:40.922
The Bombers are a footie team.

01:12:41.255 --> 01:12:42.088
AFL.

01:12:42.505 --> 01:12:45.338
Aussie rules. You guys have NFL here.
We've got AFL.

01:12:45.422 --> 01:12:48.172
Those were text messages
I sent to my mate, Wazza.

01:12:48.255 --> 01:12:49.922
Because he's an idiot Magpie fan.

01:12:50.005 --> 01:12:51.922
Got to admire the guile of these guys.

01:12:52.338 --> 01:12:54.630
They concoct a pro-American play,

01:12:54.713 --> 01:12:57.922
sell out to a thousand crazed zealots
in Detroit,

01:12:58.005 --> 01:13:01.213
and then hide
all their sicko terrorist messages

01:13:01.297 --> 01:13:02.880
behind a football team.

01:13:03.672 --> 01:13:04.505
Wow.

01:13:05.380 --> 01:13:06.255
No.

01:13:06.630 --> 01:13:09.213
I've got to be in Detroit.
I've got to disappear.

01:13:09.880 --> 01:13:10.922
It's God's plan.

01:13:13.672 --> 01:13:16.297
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is your captain speaking.

01:13:16.547 --> 01:13:18.088
I'll ask you to fasten your seat belts.

01:13:18.172 --> 01:13:20.547
We'll have turbulence
on our descent into Melbourne.

01:13:20.630 --> 01:13:22.713
A few bumps ahead, I'm afraid.

01:13:43.422 --> 01:13:44.255
Ali.

01:13:51.630 --> 01:13:54.172
I will ask you this once and once only.

01:13:55.130 --> 01:13:57.047
All I want is a straight answer.

01:14:00.172 --> 01:14:01.547
Are you doing medicine?

01:14:07.422 --> 01:14:10.088
Did you get the score
you told everyone you got?

01:14:10.172 --> 01:14:12.838
Sheikhna, don't be too hard on the boy.

01:14:13.172 --> 01:14:15.547
I was trying to let them know
you were overseas

01:14:15.630 --> 01:14:17.588
and they told me you weren't enrolled.

01:14:17.672 --> 01:14:20.880
So naturally we thought
that there must be a mistake.

01:14:21.463 --> 01:14:22.547
But, alas.

01:14:23.047 --> 01:14:26.255
When have I given you the impression
I am your enemy?

01:14:27.630 --> 01:14:29.255
Or worse, a dictator?

01:14:29.630 --> 01:14:30.463
Or...

01:14:32.797 --> 01:14:35.505
You couldn't come to me
and tell me straight?

01:14:36.838 --> 01:14:37.672
"Dad.

01:14:38.005 --> 01:14:39.213
I failed. I'm sorry.

01:14:39.630 --> 01:14:41.297
I tried, but not to be."

01:14:42.505 --> 01:14:44.463
-I'm sorry, Dad.
-Sorry, nothing.

01:14:45.047 --> 01:14:47.172
You will apologize to the community.

01:14:48.422 --> 01:14:49.297
I am done.

01:15:01.130 --> 01:15:05.380
The Prophet has said
that lying is a sin,

01:15:06.213 --> 01:15:10.588
which burns away at the soul
as fire burns through wood.

01:15:16.588 --> 01:15:17.422
Hence,

01:15:18.547 --> 01:15:20.213
I stand before you,

01:15:21.088 --> 01:15:22.338
and before God,

01:15:26.380 --> 01:15:28.088
offering my repentance.

01:15:33.838 --> 01:15:35.838
Assalamu 'Alaikum.

01:15:39.797 --> 01:15:41.005
We've now heard it.

01:15:41.630 --> 01:15:44.547
Where to now? I hear everyone ask.

01:15:46.838 --> 01:15:50.380
Sheikh Mahdi has done a reasonable job
raising his children.

01:15:51.005 --> 01:15:55.422
I don't see the need
for our sheikh to step down immediately.

01:15:56.630 --> 01:16:00.380
However, if my son
had been a lying failure,

01:16:00.463 --> 01:16:03.713
I know in my heart,
I could not live with the shame.

01:16:03.797 --> 01:16:06.672
Sheikhna, what if the boy gets married?

01:16:07.172 --> 01:16:09.047
To atone and prove he is a man.

01:16:10.505 --> 01:16:12.505
Abu Faisal.

01:16:13.297 --> 01:16:14.130
Please.

01:16:16.755 --> 01:16:18.297
It is with great pain,

01:16:19.880 --> 01:16:21.797
I must reveal another,

01:16:22.338 --> 01:16:24.213
yet more shocking truth.

01:16:24.922 --> 01:16:26.922
I, unwittingly,

01:16:27.713 --> 01:16:29.047
while driving my taxi,

01:16:29.380 --> 01:16:32.630
stumbled upon Ali
with a loose Muslim woman,

01:16:32.713 --> 01:16:36.463
at places not consistent
with our religion.

01:16:37.047 --> 01:16:38.088
A bowling alley.

01:16:38.797 --> 01:16:39.880
An aquarium.

01:16:40.547 --> 01:16:43.922
The picture resolution is not perfect,
but if you zoom in...

01:16:45.713 --> 01:16:48.088
What is this fool on about?
Tell me this was not you.

01:16:48.713 --> 01:16:49.547
No!

01:16:50.005 --> 01:16:50.880
Haj Karim.

01:16:51.588 --> 01:16:54.547
You offered Ali
your daughter's hand in marriage,

01:16:54.797 --> 01:16:57.422
and he has betrayed her
with another woman.

01:16:58.630 --> 01:17:00.547
It helps no one to name names.

01:17:01.047 --> 01:17:02.588
The girl knows who she is.

01:17:02.922 --> 01:17:06.297
That's what happens
when we let our women go to university.

01:17:06.422 --> 01:17:10.005
Seyyed, please.
Why are you doing this to her?

01:17:10.797 --> 01:17:13.422
Please, sir.
It's not her fault. Please.

01:17:13.797 --> 01:17:14.630
I beg you.

01:17:14.838 --> 01:17:16.838
Nothing improper happened.
She's guiltless.

01:17:16.922 --> 01:17:17.755
I trusted you.

01:17:18.755 --> 01:17:19.588
You've shamed me.

01:17:19.672 --> 01:17:20.505
It's not her fault.

01:17:20.588 --> 01:17:21.630
You've shamed me.

01:17:21.713 --> 01:17:23.338
I think you have said enough.

01:17:36.588 --> 01:17:37.422
Dianne, wait.

01:17:38.338 --> 01:17:39.922
I've never touched Yomna.

01:17:40.172 --> 01:17:42.922
My parents, the community...
They all arranged it for me.

01:17:43.005 --> 01:17:43.838
Believe me.

01:17:43.922 --> 01:17:45.422
Why would I do that?

01:17:45.505 --> 01:17:48.838
You've told so many lies,
you have no soul left.

01:17:49.213 --> 01:17:51.130
Everything about you is just a lie.

01:17:51.213 --> 01:17:53.172
No, everything except you is a lie.

01:17:53.255 --> 01:17:55.005
Do you get what you've done, Ali?

01:17:55.088 --> 01:17:56.797
I can't do medicine.

01:17:56.880 --> 01:17:59.172
He's going to send me back to Lebanon.

01:17:59.255 --> 01:18:00.672
You have fucked up my life.

01:18:00.755 --> 01:18:03.380
-OK. I'll talk to your dad.
-You've fucked up my life.

01:18:03.463 --> 01:18:05.380
Don't talk to anyone, ever.

01:18:05.797 --> 01:18:08.047
Sit in a cave for the rest of your life.

01:18:08.130 --> 01:18:10.338
-Just leave me the fuck alone.
-But I love you.

01:18:10.838 --> 01:18:13.088
I absolutely hate you. I hate you.

01:18:13.172 --> 01:18:15.088
I hate you. I divorce you.

01:18:15.172 --> 01:18:17.422
I divorce you. I divorce you.

01:18:18.005 --> 01:18:21.380
I divorce you.
I divorce you a thousand times.

01:18:25.047 --> 01:18:26.880
That's one continuous thought.

01:18:47.213 --> 01:18:49.672
All this madness will soon be behind us.

01:18:52.588 --> 01:18:54.422
Let's just get through the day.

01:18:55.797 --> 01:18:56.630
Good boy.

01:19:03.380 --> 01:19:05.797
Prove yourself a worthy husband to Yomna,

01:19:06.380 --> 01:19:07.880
and all will be forgiven.

01:19:08.380 --> 01:19:10.630
Not many girls would have forgiven you.

01:19:10.713 --> 01:19:14.838
She has accepted
you just knew the Lebanese from uni.

01:19:17.922 --> 01:19:18.755
Mohammed.

01:19:19.172 --> 01:19:20.547
-Yeah, Mum.
-Inside.

01:19:20.755 --> 01:19:22.172
Are you going to be OK?

01:19:31.880 --> 01:19:33.380
Ali, you're in luck.

01:19:33.463 --> 01:19:36.463
My dad just bought a second-hand taxi.
The night shift's yours.

01:19:36.547 --> 01:19:38.755
In two years' time,
you could have the day shift.

01:19:39.213 --> 01:19:40.047
Thanks, Ayoob.

01:19:40.172 --> 01:19:41.922
Hey, Az, it's a good turnout.

01:19:42.338 --> 01:19:45.547
I might say hello to your old man.
What do I say? Your holiness?

01:19:45.630 --> 01:19:46.463
Just say hi.

01:19:47.547 --> 01:19:50.380
Take one tablet, an hour before bed.

01:19:51.755 --> 01:19:53.005
The rocket will launch...

01:19:53.547 --> 01:19:55.297
and keep launching.

01:20:16.880 --> 01:20:19.463
I have already sought consent
from the bride.

01:20:20.630 --> 01:20:21.463
Ali.

01:20:23.172 --> 01:20:24.380
Do you give consent?

01:20:35.547 --> 01:20:36.380
I do.

01:20:38.338 --> 01:20:39.255
Shall we begin?

01:21:02.505 --> 01:21:03.338
Smile.

01:21:28.505 --> 01:21:30.588
Dance. Go on, dance.

01:22:06.672 --> 01:22:08.463
Move your seat forward, will you?

01:22:08.547 --> 01:22:10.130
Couldn't you just get a Holden?

01:22:10.213 --> 01:22:12.047
Are you kidding, bro? Porsche.

01:22:12.963 --> 01:22:13.797
What's this?

01:22:13.880 --> 01:22:16.422
Abu Ghaith's wife...
He married that half-Leb, Linda.

01:22:16.505 --> 01:22:18.755
She knows Johnno from work.
Abdullah told me--

01:22:18.838 --> 01:22:20.130
Who's the letter from?

01:22:20.255 --> 01:22:22.380
I was to give it after you got married.
I dunno.

01:22:29.338 --> 01:22:30.547
Moe. Moe Green.

01:22:30.630 --> 01:22:31.547
For God's sake.

01:22:38.172 --> 01:22:41.088
♪ This car's got no walls
But Moe Green's got two balls♪

01:22:41.922 --> 01:22:43.547
♪ It's a drop top
For my fat cock♪

01:22:43.755 --> 01:22:45.547
♪ It's a drop top
For my fat cock♪

01:22:46.172 --> 01:22:49.588
♪ Bitches take my calls
But Moe Green's got two balls♪

01:22:49.838 --> 01:22:51.588
♪ It's a drop top
For my fat cock♪

01:23:21.797 --> 01:23:22.630
Ali.

01:23:23.338 --> 01:23:24.588
You're married now.

01:23:25.005 --> 01:23:26.172
Congratulations.

01:23:27.130 --> 01:23:29.005
Yomna will make you a good wife,

01:23:29.255 --> 01:23:31.380
as I'm sure you'll make a good husband.

01:23:33.088 --> 01:23:34.755
I leave for Lebanon tonight.

01:23:36.005 --> 01:23:37.588
For many days I blamed you,

01:23:37.672 --> 01:23:40.338
but maybe medicine
was not God's wish for me.

01:23:41.047 --> 01:23:42.880
We are both trapped by family.

01:23:43.672 --> 01:23:45.172
There is no escape route.

01:23:45.672 --> 01:23:46.505
Just duty.

01:23:55.422 --> 01:23:59.463
Dad thinks it'll be best for me to go away
and spend time with his sisters.

01:24:01.380 --> 01:24:04.047
At least I'll learn
how to cook a good kibbeh.

01:24:07.713 --> 01:24:08.755
It's OK, Dad.

01:24:09.005 --> 01:24:09.838
It's OK.

01:24:13.422 --> 01:24:15.172
-It's OK.
-I failed you.

01:24:19.963 --> 01:24:21.838
Please forgive me, habibti.

01:24:24.380 --> 01:24:26.088
I know I divorced you, but...

01:24:26.172 --> 01:24:28.505
our six weeks were almost up anyway.

01:24:29.963 --> 01:24:34.088
What I didn't tell you is that they were
the happiest six weeks of my life.

01:24:36.047 --> 01:24:37.005
You're mad,

01:24:37.463 --> 01:24:38.838
but you dared to dream,

01:24:39.588 --> 01:24:40.838
and I will miss that.

01:24:44.588 --> 01:24:45.422
Dianne.

01:24:48.005 --> 01:24:48.838
Moe.

01:24:48.963 --> 01:24:51.422
Can you pull over, bro?
I need some fresh air.

01:24:51.797 --> 01:24:54.338
-This is a convertible, bro.
-Just pull over.

01:24:54.422 --> 01:24:56.047
-We're almost there, man.
-No.

01:24:57.505 --> 01:24:58.338
Let him.

01:25:21.213 --> 01:25:22.630
You look very beautiful.

01:26:07.297 --> 01:26:08.255
What's he doing?

01:26:15.213 --> 01:26:16.297
Ali, you dickhead.

01:26:17.838 --> 01:26:18.672
No!

01:26:25.297 --> 01:26:26.130
Drive me back.

01:26:45.213 --> 01:26:46.088
Come on, God.

01:26:47.130 --> 01:26:49.797
If you want me to get to Dianne,
show me a real sign.

01:26:49.880 --> 01:26:51.588
Your last few have been shit.

01:26:57.088 --> 01:26:59.880
Thank you, God Almighty.

01:27:01.297 --> 01:27:03.297
I'm trying to get to the airport.

01:27:06.297 --> 01:27:09.588
And that, Your Worship,
is roughly the whole story.

01:27:10.130 --> 01:27:12.380
Actually, there's other stuff
I should add--

01:27:12.463 --> 01:27:14.130
No, Mr. Albasri.

01:27:14.672 --> 01:27:17.172
-I've had an hour of your talking--
-Your Honor...

01:27:17.255 --> 01:27:19.713
-And it's been riveting.
-The handbrake fell off.

01:27:19.797 --> 01:27:23.755
Yes, but you had no business
being on the tractor.

01:27:23.838 --> 01:27:27.422
And as for defrauding the university,
that is hardly good character evidence.

01:27:27.505 --> 01:27:29.047
I've already pleaded guilty.

01:27:29.380 --> 01:27:32.380
I can do community service,
you can slap me with a fine...

01:27:32.463 --> 01:27:33.547
Anything you like.

01:27:33.797 --> 01:27:34.672
But please.

01:27:35.713 --> 01:27:37.922
Today's the day that Dianne flies out.

01:27:38.005 --> 01:27:38.838
Now, Your Honor,

01:27:38.922 --> 01:27:42.880
I'm not talking to you as a judge anymore.
I'm talking to you as a human being.

01:27:43.088 --> 01:27:44.130
Human to human.

01:27:44.797 --> 01:27:46.630
You're a woman. You understand love.

01:27:47.213 --> 01:27:49.213
Please. I could still make it.

01:27:49.672 --> 01:27:50.672
Mr. Albasri,

01:27:50.755 --> 01:27:53.797
I'm more a woman who understands the law.

01:27:53.880 --> 01:27:55.880
If I could just borrow a car...

01:27:56.047 --> 01:27:58.547
And I am not convinced
that you understand...

01:27:58.630 --> 01:28:01.422
-I could make it.
-...the recklessness of your actions.

01:28:01.547 --> 01:28:03.130
I find the charges proved,

01:28:03.213 --> 01:28:06.630
but given the inordinate amount of time
you've used today,

01:28:07.463 --> 01:28:10.588
I'll adjourn until Monday for sentencing.

01:28:25.755 --> 01:28:27.880
Got to get you back
to the holding cell.

01:29:02.797 --> 01:29:06.672
The birds in this country
are not very musical.

01:29:12.713 --> 01:29:13.547
How's Yomna?

01:29:15.130 --> 01:29:15.963
Sad.

01:29:16.755 --> 01:29:17.588
Embarrassed.

01:29:19.505 --> 01:29:22.422
But possibly she's relieved.

01:29:23.505 --> 01:29:25.338
I think I should get a divorce.

01:29:26.838 --> 01:29:29.505
When you are only married
an hour and a half,

01:29:30.463 --> 01:29:31.838
I think it is called

01:29:32.922 --> 01:29:33.922
an annulment,

01:29:34.005 --> 01:29:36.338
but, to protect Yomna's dignity,

01:29:37.047 --> 01:29:39.588
Abu Faisal came up with a useful excuse.

01:29:40.422 --> 01:29:41.255
Yeah, good.

01:29:42.588 --> 01:29:44.880
Everyone now thinks you are impotent.

01:29:48.297 --> 01:29:49.130
Great.

01:29:50.297 --> 01:29:51.713
There is always a price.

01:29:57.547 --> 01:29:59.838
How did you part with Dianne?

01:30:02.422 --> 01:30:03.255
She's gone.

01:30:04.380 --> 01:30:08.213
She said, "I absolutely hate you,"
and divorced me a thousand times.

01:30:12.422 --> 01:30:14.672
A good woman, you have to earn.

01:30:17.963 --> 01:30:20.422
You'll never have
the son you deserve, Dad.

01:30:33.547 --> 01:30:35.338
I have been a very bad father.

01:30:41.047 --> 01:30:43.422
If I have not communicated to you

01:30:45.088 --> 01:30:46.588
how much you are loved...

01:30:49.130 --> 01:30:50.588
then I am the failure.

01:30:50.672 --> 01:30:51.880
I am the bad Muslim.

01:30:51.963 --> 01:30:53.505
Because you are loved.

01:30:55.463 --> 01:30:56.713
Without condition.

01:30:59.922 --> 01:31:00.880
You, and your...

01:31:02.338 --> 01:31:05.922
insane brother, your brilliant sister.

01:31:09.005 --> 01:31:09.838
You are loved.

01:31:15.713 --> 01:31:16.547
I thought...

01:31:17.047 --> 01:31:20.755
I thought maybe I could go back to Iran,
you know? Study medicine there.

01:31:23.713 --> 01:31:25.380
You are not listening to me.

01:31:27.630 --> 01:31:29.088
What do you want to do?

01:31:38.755 --> 01:31:40.838
I just want to make you proud, Dad.

01:31:50.380 --> 01:31:52.005
Then be proud of yourself.

01:31:53.797 --> 01:31:56.588
There are a million ways to serve God.

01:31:57.547 --> 01:31:59.672
This has all been part of his plan.

01:32:01.088 --> 01:32:02.713
The exam, uni...

01:32:04.172 --> 01:32:06.588
The wedding, prison. It's all God's plan?

01:32:08.297 --> 01:32:09.130
I think...

01:32:09.672 --> 01:32:12.880
I think I've got to stop blaming God
for my mistakes, Dad.

01:32:12.963 --> 01:32:15.713
It's time we gave the Almighty a break.

01:32:25.130 --> 01:32:27.172
What's gonna happen to you
at the mosque?

01:32:29.005 --> 01:32:31.588
During the Abbasid Dynasty,

01:32:33.338 --> 01:32:35.880
a man and his son rode on a donkey.

01:32:36.255 --> 01:32:40.172
But once they reached the town of Kandahar
the people abused them.

01:32:40.755 --> 01:32:41.588
They said,

01:32:42.047 --> 01:32:44.505
"Poor donkey.
You make him carry two fit men."

01:32:44.838 --> 01:32:46.963
So, the father rode, and the son walked.

01:32:47.047 --> 01:32:50.963
But when they arrived at the next town,
people cried,

01:32:51.047 --> 01:32:52.588
'"Look at this fellow.

01:32:52.672 --> 01:32:55.838
He drags his young defenseless boy
through the desert heat,

01:32:55.922 --> 01:32:57.922
and he enjoys the ride of a lifetime."

01:32:59.547 --> 01:33:03.588
So in the next town,
the son rode and the father walked,

01:33:03.672 --> 01:33:05.630
but people shouted at the boy.

01:33:06.255 --> 01:33:08.672
"You are young. You are healthy.

01:33:09.005 --> 01:33:12.713
You make your elderly father suffer.

01:33:12.797 --> 01:33:14.463
He is marching in the heat."

01:33:15.213 --> 01:33:20.838
So, together, the father and his son
decided to walk with their donkey.

01:33:21.505 --> 01:33:24.630
As they passed through the next town,
people laughed.

01:33:25.255 --> 01:33:26.880
"Look at these two idiots.

01:33:27.380 --> 01:33:29.213
Why don't they ride their donkey?"

01:33:29.297 --> 01:33:31.547
And in every town, people criticized them.

01:33:31.630 --> 01:33:34.338
In the end, the father said,
"Stuff this."

01:33:34.422 --> 01:33:37.380
And he and the boy
carried the donkey on their back.

01:33:44.255 --> 01:33:45.088
But...

01:33:45.672 --> 01:33:48.755
We tie ourselves up in terrible knots,

01:33:48.838 --> 01:33:51.922
trying to live up to
the judgment of others.

01:33:55.672 --> 01:33:59.922
So, I will not carry the donkey
on my back anymore.

01:34:02.297 --> 01:34:05.922
I have made my peace with Haj Karim,
and his fine family.

01:34:06.005 --> 01:34:09.713
Hajjina, you are a credit to this mosque,
as is your daughter.

01:34:10.213 --> 01:34:11.838
And now I will step down.

01:34:12.588 --> 01:34:15.797
I will hand my duties over
to Seyyed Ghaffar.

01:34:43.838 --> 01:34:44.672
No!

01:34:45.588 --> 01:34:46.588
[We don't want him.

01:34:46.672 --> 01:34:48.172
-No, not him.
-He's boring.

01:34:48.255 --> 01:34:49.713
-He's a fake.
-A shit cleric.

01:34:49.797 --> 01:34:52.255
Who'll write our musicals?
He has no stories.

01:34:52.338 --> 01:34:54.130
We all have stupid children.

01:34:56.672 --> 01:34:57.505
Please.

01:34:57.588 --> 01:34:59.880
Please. Calm down. Respect the place.

01:35:00.755 --> 01:35:02.588
Sheikh Mahdi.

01:35:06.838 --> 01:35:08.422
You ignorant fools.

01:35:09.463 --> 01:35:11.047
He wears the white turban.

01:35:11.297 --> 01:35:12.505
He is nothing.

01:35:12.713 --> 01:35:14.338
I wear the black turban.

01:35:15.297 --> 01:35:17.505
Have you all forgotten what it means?

01:35:17.838 --> 01:35:20.713
I am the direct descendant of the Prophet.

01:35:21.838 --> 01:35:23.505
I am an imam too.

01:35:24.380 --> 01:35:28.088
I studied in the seminary
for 11 wretched years.

01:35:28.630 --> 01:35:30.588
You all are beneath me.

01:35:32.630 --> 01:35:34.672
I'm starting my own mosque.

01:35:36.172 --> 01:35:37.422
Who will follow me?

01:35:41.255 --> 01:35:42.088
Who?

01:35:44.547 --> 01:35:45.380
Who?

01:35:50.755 --> 01:35:52.255
You fools.

01:35:57.338 --> 01:35:59.255
Sheikhna, forgive me.

01:36:00.047 --> 01:36:02.422
Two days ago,
I became engaged to his sister.

01:36:03.297 --> 01:36:06.130
If I don't go with him, then...

01:36:06.797 --> 01:36:08.547
But I'll be back.

01:36:16.005 --> 01:36:17.630
Sheikh Mahdi.

01:36:26.463 --> 01:36:27.297
She's there.

01:36:38.172 --> 01:36:39.005
Yomna.

01:36:40.422 --> 01:36:41.797
Yomna, I'm truly sorry.

01:36:44.422 --> 01:36:45.838
You deserve to be loved.

01:36:48.380 --> 01:36:49.338
And you will be.

01:37:10.255 --> 01:37:11.088
Recording.

01:37:11.838 --> 01:37:12.672
Hi, Dianne.

01:37:13.130 --> 01:37:13.963
How are you?

01:37:15.838 --> 01:37:17.547
Before you unplug me, please.

01:37:18.005 --> 01:37:20.838
I've just got a couple of things to say,
and that's it.

01:37:21.672 --> 01:37:22.505
First...

01:37:23.463 --> 01:37:24.672
I'm truly sorry.

01:37:26.088 --> 01:37:26.922
Second...

01:37:27.880 --> 01:37:29.880
I hope you're really well.

01:37:31.380 --> 01:37:36.505
Third, and this is really
my first and only point.

01:37:38.463 --> 01:37:39.380
I love you.

01:37:40.463 --> 01:37:41.838
I love you so much.

01:37:44.297 --> 01:37:46.838
My marriage
lasted one hour and forty minutes.

01:37:46.922 --> 01:37:49.838
It turns out not even Muslims
can marry someone when...

01:37:50.130 --> 01:37:52.505
they've got their heart set
on someone else.

01:38:00.630 --> 01:38:01.463
Look at this.

01:38:02.297 --> 01:38:03.547
Fifty dollars' worth.

01:38:09.463 --> 01:38:10.297
Dianne.

01:38:10.755 --> 01:38:15.172
Last year I went to uni
every day for a whole year.

01:38:16.963 --> 01:38:17.797
This year,

01:38:18.338 --> 01:38:20.880
I'm going to go to the airport
every single day,

01:38:20.963 --> 01:38:23.297
and meet every single flight
out of Lebanon,

01:38:23.380 --> 01:38:26.380
just on the off chance
that you're going to be on one.

01:38:26.463 --> 01:38:27.963
You've got community service.

01:38:29.005 --> 01:38:29.838
Shit.

01:38:31.880 --> 01:38:32.922
I can't do Tuesdays.

01:38:33.005 --> 01:38:35.130
I've got community service
for a couple months,

01:38:35.213 --> 01:38:36.463
but every other day...

01:38:37.172 --> 01:38:38.505
I'm going to be there.

01:38:39.088 --> 01:38:41.130
And you know I'm mad enough to do it.

01:38:44.713 --> 01:38:45.672
Because...

01:38:45.922 --> 01:38:47.047
what's my life worth,

01:38:47.130 --> 01:38:50.422
if I can't wake up next to you
every morning, and...

01:38:51.922 --> 01:38:53.755
see you with your hair out?

01:39:01.713 --> 01:39:03.630
Beep beep. Mafia coming through.

01:39:03.797 --> 01:39:06.172
She's not going to show, bro.
Lebs never show.

01:39:07.297 --> 01:39:08.130
Salaam.

01:39:10.047 --> 01:39:12.755
Sheikhna, my wife is going overseas
without me.

01:39:12.838 --> 01:39:14.755
How will I find my socks?

01:39:14.838 --> 01:39:17.088
Who will cook me
that succulent sheep's head?

01:39:17.172 --> 01:39:18.255
Brother Qais...

01:39:18.672 --> 01:39:20.088
It's only for two weeks.

01:39:24.463 --> 01:39:25.297
Ramona.

01:39:36.505 --> 01:39:37.838
Wait.

01:39:38.630 --> 01:39:40.713
If by some miracle she comes...

01:39:42.172 --> 01:39:44.005
A small gift from the family.

01:39:44.130 --> 01:39:45.005
What is it?

01:39:45.297 --> 01:39:46.338
It's a cookbook.

01:39:47.255 --> 01:39:48.130
Iraqi.

01:39:48.630 --> 01:39:50.422
-Not Lebanese.
-Thanks, Mum

01:40:34.797 --> 01:40:36.005
Sorry, mate. Sorry.

01:40:37.380 --> 01:40:39.672
I'm calling from Australia,

01:40:39.755 --> 01:40:41.713
looking for Dianne Mohsen.

01:40:42.588 --> 01:40:43.797
Yes, I'm Iraqi.

01:40:46.172 --> 01:40:47.005
Hello?

01:40:51.630 --> 01:40:54.463
Mohsen, the guy who has
a fish and chip store in Melbourne.

01:40:54.547 --> 01:40:55.963
I called you yesterday.

01:40:56.047 --> 01:40:57.672
My name's Ali. Ali Albasri.

01:40:58.380 --> 01:40:59.963
Yeah, the impotent one.

01:41:00.547 --> 01:41:02.213
So, tonight's the night?

01:41:02.797 --> 01:41:03.672
I can feel it.

01:41:04.255 --> 01:41:05.505
Good luck, my friend.

01:41:06.297 --> 01:41:07.463
What? Privacy policy?

01:41:07.547 --> 01:41:10.088
I just want to know if she's on the plane.
That's all.

01:41:10.172 --> 01:41:12.380
Mate, it's a matter of life and death.

01:41:12.713 --> 01:41:14.297
No, that wasn't a threat.

01:41:19.713 --> 01:41:22.380
She left the village?

01:41:23.380 --> 01:41:24.213
I'll try--

01:41:24.630 --> 01:41:25.713
Wait a minute...

01:41:27.547 --> 01:41:29.422
She's in Beirut?

01:41:30.088 --> 01:41:31.213
She left yesterday?

01:41:33.422 --> 01:41:35.547
Thank you. A million thank yous.

01:41:37.213 --> 01:41:38.422
Tonight's the night.

01:41:39.963 --> 01:41:42.005
Hey, man. It's free.

01:42:10.713 --> 01:42:13.380
Welcome to
Melbourne International Airport.

01:42:13.713 --> 01:42:14.963
