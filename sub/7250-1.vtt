I'LL TRY.

07:15.185 --> 07:18.230
I'VE GOT TO LEAVE IN A MINUTE.

07:18.272 --> 07:20.774
IS THERE ANY MORE BACON?

07:18.272 --> 07:20.774
HAVE MINE.

07:20.815 --> 07:22.943
WHAT ABOUT MAHOGANY

07:20.815 --> 07:22.943
FOR THE LIVING ROOM,

07:22.984 --> 07:25.904
AND THEN MIDNIGHT BLUE FOR

07:22.984 --> 07:25.904
THE HALLWAY AND THE BEDROOM?

07:25.946 --> 07:28.365
JACKSON JUST SAID HE'S FINE

07:25.946 --> 07:28.365
WITH HOW EVERYTHING IS.

07:28.407 --> 07:30.742
I DON'T THINK

07:28.407 --> 07:30.742
IT'S BUGGING HIM.

07:28.407 --> 07:30.742
NOT NOW.

07:30.784 --> 07:32.244
IT'LL BUG HIM EVENTUALLY,

07:32.286 --> 07:34.829
AND THEN HE'LL RESENT THIS PLACE

07:32.286 --> 07:34.829
AND ME BY EXTENSION,

07:34.871 --> 07:36.790
AND I WOULD LIKE TO

07:34.871 --> 07:36.790
AVOID THAT.

07:36.831 --> 07:38.833
I NEED TO BUTCH

07:36.831 --> 07:38.833
THE PLACE UP.

07:38.875 --> 07:42.629
HELP ME PICK A COLOR.

07:38.875 --> 07:42.629
OKAY, I CAN'T NOW,

07:38.875 --> 07:42.629
BUT I'LL DO IT LATER.

07:42.670 --> 07:45.173
THANKS FOR BREAKFAST.

07:42.670 --> 07:45.173
IT WAS AMAZING.

07:45.215 --> 07:47.426
OH, HEY, BACON'S MANLY.

07:45.215 --> 07:47.426
WHY DON'T YOU JUST

07:47.467 --> 07:50.304
NAIL A BUNCH OF PACKAGES OF

07:47.467 --> 07:50.304
KOSHER BACON ON THE WALLS.

07:50.345 --> 07:54.433
SMELLS LIKE MEAT, BLESSED BY

07:50.345 --> 07:54.433
A RABBI, THAT'S A MANLY HOUSE.

07:50.345 --> 07:54.433
BYE-BYE.

07:54.474 --> 07:56.935
IF YOU'RE STILL THINKING PAINT,

07:54.474 --> 07:56.935
YOU'RE THINKING LIKE A CHICK.

07:59.354 --> 08:02.316
WATCH THOSE STREAMERS -- AND NOT

07:59.354 --> 08:02.316
TOO MUCH RED NEAR THAT TREE.

08:02.357 --> 08:04.318
LIGHT TOUCH, LIGHT TOUCH,

08:02.357 --> 08:04.318
LIGHT TOUCH.

08:04.359 --> 08:06.569
HOW'S THE LEG?

08:04.359 --> 08:06.569
IT'S JUST FINE.

08:06.611 --> 08:09.364
HAVEN'T FOUND OUT

08:06.611 --> 08:09.364
WHO PUT THAT BANANA PEEL

08:06.611 --> 08:09.364
ON YOUR DOORSTEP?

08:09.406 --> 08:11.950
NO, BUT I HAVE

08:09.406 --> 08:11.950
A LIST OF SUSPECTS.

08:11.992 --> 08:13.660
HEY, UM, WHAT'S ALL THIS FOR?

08:13.701 --> 08:15.745

08:18.665 --> 08:22.710

08:18.665 --> 08:22.710

08:22.752 --> 08:24.379
I'M REALLY GOING

08:22.752 --> 08:24.379
ALL-OUT FOR THIS.

08:24.421 --> 08:26.714
I EVEN THINK

08:24.421 --> 08:26.714
YOU'LL BE IMPRESSED.

08:24.421 --> 08:26.714
REALLY? EVEN ME?

08:26.756 --> 08:31.511
YES, SIRREE, MINI-ME.

08:26.756 --> 08:31.511
I DID NOT PUT THE WORD "MADNESS"

08:26.756 --> 08:31.511
IN THE TITLE FOR NOTHING.

08:31.552 --> 08:35.265
THIS PLACE IS GONNA BE CRAZY --

08:31.552 --> 08:35.265
WILD -- FOOD, GAMES --

08:35.307 --> 08:38.352
WE'VE EVEN GOT A BAND COMING

08:35.307 --> 08:38.352

08:38.393 --> 08:39.853

08:39.894 --> 08:42.314
AND WAIT TILL YOU SEE

08:39.894 --> 08:42.314

08:42.356 --> 08:44.358
IT'S GONNA MAKE THE

08:42.356 --> 08:44.358
BANNERS WE'VE EVER HAD

08:44.399 --> 08:45.984
LOOK DOWNRIGHT EMBARRASSING.

08:46.026 --> 08:48.278
YOU'RE ON FIRE.

08:46.026 --> 08:48.278
I LOVE THIS BANNER.

08:48.320 --> 08:50.571
I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE IT.

08:48.320 --> 08:50.571
COME ON FRIDAY.

08:50.613 --> 08:52.115
EXCUSE ME, YOUNG LADY.

08:52.157 --> 08:54.826
YOUNG LADY?

08:52.157 --> 08:54.826
YOU KNOW I'M TALKING TO YOU.

08:54.868 --> 08:58.413
THE BLONDE WOMAN WITH

08:54.868 --> 08:58.413
THE RIBBONS, PLEASE SLOW DOWN.

08:58.455 --> 09:02.417
I'M IN A WHEELCHAIR.

08:58.455 --> 09:02.417
I CAN'T RUN AFTER YOU.

09:02.459 --> 09:04.127
I MEAN, COME ON,

09:02.459 --> 09:04.127
SENATOR BOXER --

09:04.169 --> 09:06.796
AS ONE OF OUR FOREMOST

09:04.169 --> 09:06.796
DEMOCRATIC LEADERS, I ASK YOU --

09:06.838 --> 09:11.301
DOES IT LOOK GOOD TO HAVE

09:06.838 --> 09:11.301
THE AMERICAN SECRETARY OF THE

09:06.838 --> 09:11.301
TREASURY TRAVELING WITH BONO?

09:11.343 --> 09:14.762
I MEAN, I KNOW APPARENTLY

09:11.343 --> 09:14.762
HE'S A "SAINT,".

09:14.804 --> 09:17.307
BUT MY GOD, HE NEVER EVEN TAKES

09:14.804 --> 09:17.307
THE SUNGLASSES OFF.

09:17.349 --> 09:19.351
WE HAVE AN IMAGE TO MAINTAIN,

09:17.349 --> 09:19.351
DON'T WE?

09:19.393 --> 09:22.229
AREN'T WE TRYING TO PRETEND

09:19.393 --> 09:22.229
WE'RE THE SUPERPOWER

09:19.393 --> 09:22.229
IN THIS WORLD?

09:22.270 --> 09:24.523
WHY NOT SEND CARSON DALY

09:22.270 --> 09:24.523
TO THE MIDDLE EAST

09:24.605 --> 09:25.982
NEXT TIME CHENEY GOES?

09:26.024 --> 09:28.026
HOOK UP FREDDIE PRINZE, JR.

09:26.024 --> 09:28.026
WITH COLIN POWELL

09:28.068 --> 09:29.569
AT THE NEXT MEETING

09:28.068 --> 09:29.569
WITH NATO.

09:29.610 --> 09:32.364
HELL, LET'S HEAR WHAT FREDDIE

09:29.610 --> 09:32.364
HAS TO SAY, RIGHT?

09:32.406 --> 09:34.032
PARIS, DO YOU KNOW

09:34.074 --> 09:36.784
<i>REPUBLICAN</i> CONGRESSMAN

09:34.074 --> 09:36.784
DOUG OSE FROM CALIFORNIA?

09:36.826 --> 09:38.328

09:38.370 --> 09:41.873
YOU TWO WILL HAVE SO MUCH

09:38.370 --> 09:41.873
TO TALK ABOUT. BYE.

09:41.915 --> 09:43.083
UM, BARBARA?

09:43.124 --> 09:44.125
OSE, RIGHT?

09:44.167 --> 09:45.252
YES, THAT'S RIGHT.

09:45.293 --> 09:47.837
LET'S TAKE A WALK.

09:47.879 --> 09:50.715
LAST DAY HERE.

09:47.879 --> 09:50.715
YEP.

09:50.757 --> 09:52.884
IN YOUR OPINION,

09:50.757 --> 09:52.884
HOW IS OUR NATION'S CAPITAL?

09:52.926 --> 09:55.512
I GOT TO SEE ARCHIE BUNKER'S

09:52.926 --> 09:55.512
CHAIR AT THE SMITHSONIAN,

09:55.554 --> 09:57.556
SO IT WAS

09:55.554 --> 09:57.556
A BIG THUMBS-UP FOR ME.

09:57.597 --> 10:00.100
THERE ARE TIMES WHEN THIS

09:57.597 --> 10:00.100
COUNTRY'S PRIORITIES ARE RIGHT.

10:00.141 --> 10:01.518
SO, WHERE'S PARIS?

10:01.560 --> 10:03.770
NOT QUITE SURE.

10:01.560 --> 10:03.770
LAST TIME I SAW HER,

10:03.811 --> 10:06.898
SHE WAS BEATING THE WILL TO LIVE

10:03.811 --> 10:06.898
OUT OF OUR NATION'S

10:03.811 --> 10:06.898
REPRESENTATIVES.

10:06.940 --> 10:08.149
SHE IS A HAMMER.

10:08.191 --> 10:10.068
ACTUALLY,

10:08.191 --> 10:10.068
SHE'S THE ENTIRE TOOLBOX.

10:10.110 --> 10:12.446
I ALWAYS SEEM TO CATCH

10:10.110 --> 10:12.446
THE MOST INTERESTING POLITICIANS

10:12.487 --> 10:13.988
WHEN THEY'RE

10:12.487 --> 10:13.988
GOING TO THE BATHROOM.

10:14.030 --> 10:16.908
HEY, JAMIE.

10:14.030 --> 10:16.908
PARIS...

10:16.950 --> 10:19.202
I GOT A PEEK AT

10:16.950 --> 10:19.202
THE FINAL DEBATE PAIRINGS.

10:19.244 --> 10:21.829
SEEMS LIKE YOU AND I

10:19.244 --> 10:21.829
ARE ON THE SAME SIDE.

10:21.871 --> 10:24.082
YOU'D THINK THEY'D GIVE

10:21.871 --> 10:24.082
SOMEONE A FIGHTING CHANCE.

10:24.124 --> 10:25.792
APPARENTLY NOT.

10:24.124 --> 10:25.792
GOD I LOVE THIS.

10:25.833 --> 10:28.253
YOU DON'T REALIZE HOW

10:25.833 --> 10:28.253
UNQUALIFIED AMERICA'S YOUTH IS

10:28.295 --> 10:31.339
UNTIL YOU GATHER THEM UP

10:28.295 --> 10:31.339
IN A ROOM AND MAKE THEM SPEAK.

10:31.381 --> 10:34.134
WHO ARE WE UP AGAINST?

10:31.381 --> 10:34.134
JASON RAUNSAVALT

10:31.381 --> 10:34.134
AND TY FREDRICKS.

10:34.175 --> 10:37.095
PERFECT, JASON'S GOT

10:34.175 --> 10:37.095
ASTHMA AND TY CRIES.

10:37.137 --> 10:40.474
WE SHOULD MEET EARLY

10:37.137 --> 10:40.474
AND GO OVER STRATEGY.

10:37.137 --> 10:40.474
GOOD, GOOD.

10:40.515 --> 10:43.560
AND THEN TONIGHT

10:40.515 --> 10:43.560
WE SHOULD CELEBRATE.

10:40.515 --> 10:43.560
WHAT IF WE DON'T WIN?

10:43.602 --> 10:45.895
DON'T LOSE IT ON ME NOW.

10:43.602 --> 10:45.895
SO, DINNER?

10:45.937 --> 10:48.731
SURE.

10:45.937 --> 10:48.731
I'LL SWING AROUND

10:45.937 --> 10:48.731
FOR YOU ABOUT 7:00.

10:48.773 --> 10:49.983
SEE YOU AT THE SLAUGHTER.

10:51.318 --> 10:53.694
WOW.

10:51.318 --> 10:53.694
WHAT?

10:53.736 --> 10:55.029
IMAGINE PAIRING ME

10:53.736 --> 10:55.029
WITH JAMIE.

10:55.071 --> 10:57.073
I MEAN, WHY NOT JUST

10:55.071 --> 10:57.073
LINE THE HALLWAYS

10:57.115 --> 10:58.908
WITH SELF-ESTEEM COUNSELORS

10:57.115 --> 10:58.908
RIGHT NOW?

10:58.950 --> 11:00.660
PARIS?

10:58.950 --> 11:00.660
WHAT?

11:00.701 --> 11:04.164
WHAT DO YOU MEAN, "WHAT?"

11:00.701 --> 11:04.164
HE ASKED YOU OUT.

11:00.701 --> 11:04.164
HE DID NOT.

11:04.205 --> 11:06.416
YES, HE DID.

11:04.205 --> 11:06.416
YOU'RE HAVING DINNER TONIGHT.

11:06.458 --> 11:08.168
IT'S A VICTORY DINNER,

11:06.458 --> 11:08.168
THAT'S IT.

11:08.209 --> 11:10.295
IF HE WANTED

11:08.209 --> 11:10.295
TO CELEBRATE WINNING A DEBATE,

11:10.337 --> 11:11.671
YOU GUYS COULD'VE HAD COFFEE.

11:11.712 --> 11:13.714
BUT HE ASKED YOU

11:11.712 --> 11:13.714
OUT ON A DATE.

11:13.756 --> 11:15.467
HE DID?

11:13.756 --> 11:15.467
YES.

11:15.509 --> 11:16.926
DID I ACCEPT?

11:15.509 --> 11:16.926
YES.

11:16.968 --> 11:18.470
I'M GOING ON A DATE?

11:16.968 --> 11:18.470
YES.

11:18.512 --> 11:20.514
OH, MAN.

11:18.512 --> 11:20.514
I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS.

11:20.555 --> 11:24.767
I FINALLY GET ASKED OUT

11:20.555 --> 11:24.767
AND I MISSED IT?

11:20.555 --> 11:24.767
WAS IT A GOOD ASK OUT?

11:24.809 --> 11:26.811
IT WAS A VERY GOOD ASK OUT.

11:26.853 --> 11:27.854
WISH I'D BEEN THERE.

11:27.895 --> 11:28.896
YOU'LL BE THERE TONIGHT.

11:28.938 --> 11:30.607
TONIGHT.

11:30.649 --> 11:32.442
TONIGHT I HAVE A DATE.

11:32.484 --> 11:35.111
TONIGHT

11:32.484 --> 11:35.111
I HAVE A DATE WITH JAMIE --

11:35.153 --> 11:36.237
A PRINCETON MAN.

11:36.279 --> 11:38.365
I CAN OVERLOOK THAT.

11:38.406 --> 11:39.782
OH, MY GOD.

11:39.824 --> 11:41.784
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

11:41.826 --> 11:43.953
<i>I</i> HAVE A DATE.

11:43.995 --> 11:44.954
[ CHUCKLES ]

11:47.915 --> 11:51.670
ONE DAY IT OCCURRED TO ME --

11:47.915 --> 11:51.670
COWS NEVER WRINKLE.

11:47.915 --> 11:51.670
MM-HMM.

11:51.710 --> 11:54.964
THINK, HAVE YOU

11:51.710 --> 11:54.964
EVER SEEN A WRINKLED COW?

11:51.710 --> 11:54.964
NO, NOT ONCE.

11:55.006 --> 11:56.841
SO I THOUGHT TO MYSELF,

11:55.006 --> 11:56.841
"THAT'S WEIRD."

11:56.883 --> 11:58.926
YES, THAT AND OTHER THINGS.

11:58.968 --> 12:01.012
SO I DECIDED

11:58.968 --> 12:01.012
TO DO A LITTLE RESEARCH.

12:01.054 --> 12:03.139
I STUDIED COWS,

12:01.054 --> 12:03.139
I STUDIED HUMANS.

12:03.181 --> 12:06.560
AND FINALLY, I DISCOVERED THE

12:03.181 --> 12:06.560
SECRET, THE SECRET OF THE COWS.

12:06.601 --> 12:08.395
MICHEL, COULD YOU --

12:06.601 --> 12:08.395
HI, KIRK.

12:08.436 --> 12:10.855
JUST IN TIME.

12:08.436 --> 12:10.855
KIRK IS ABOUT TO TELL US

12:10.897 --> 12:14.150
THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN

12:10.897 --> 12:14.150
COWS AND HUMANS.

12:14.192 --> 12:16.236
YOU MEAN OTHER THAN

12:14.192 --> 12:16.236
ONE'S A COW?

12:16.277 --> 12:17.320
SHH! GO AHEAD, KIRK.

12:17.362 --> 12:18.446
HAY.

12:18.488 --> 12:19.614
HUH?

12:19.656 --> 12:22.325
HAY. IT'S HAY.

12:19.656 --> 12:22.325
COWS EAT HAY.

12:22.367 --> 12:25.078
AND AFTER SOME EXPERIMENTATION

12:22.367 --> 12:25.078
AND A GREAT DEAL OF RESEARCH,

12:25.119 --> 12:26.705
I DEVELOPED

12:25.119 --> 12:26.705
WHAT I BELIEVE IS

12:26.745 --> 12:28.998
THE NEXT GREAT SKIN-CARE PRODUCT

24:02.858 --> 24:05.778
BECAUSE THIS IS OUR TOWN,

24:05.819 --> 24:07.321
WE NEED TO SUPPORT

24:05.819 --> 24:07.321
THESE THINGS.

24:07.363 --> 24:09.615
OKAY, BUT YOU DON'T HAVE

24:07.363 --> 24:09.615
TO CHANGE FOR THAT.

24:09.656 --> 24:12.952
I'VE BEEN AWAY FOR A WHILE.

24:09.656 --> 24:12.952
I WANT TO MAKE A NICE

24:09.656 --> 24:12.952
IMPRESSION.

24:12.993 --> 24:15.246
ON WHO?

24:12.993 --> 24:15.246
WHOEVER HAS TO LOOK AT ME.

24:15.288 --> 24:19.333
JUST HUSTLE. I PROMISED JACKSON

24:15.288 --> 24:19.333
AND SOOKIE I'D PICK THEM UP.

24:15.288 --> 24:19.333
I'LL JUST BE A MINUTE.

24:19.375 --> 24:21.627
NO WOMAN IS EVER A MINUTE

24:19.375 --> 24:21.627
WHEN SHE CHANGES.

24:21.668 --> 24:24.046
DO NOT JUDGE<i> ME</i> BY

24:21.668 --> 24:24.046
YOUR OWN STANDARDS.

24:24.088 --> 24:26.048
WOW. FANCY.

24:24.088 --> 24:26.048
IT'S NOT FANCY.

24:26.090 --> 24:28.842
YOU'LL HAVE TIME TO COME HOME

24:26.090 --> 24:28.842
AND CHANGE FOR DEAN.

24:28.884 --> 24:31.137
I'LL CHANGE NOW.

24:28.884 --> 24:31.137
SO I WON'T HAVE TO LATER.

24:31.178 --> 24:33.555
OKAY. HEY, RORY...

24:33.597 --> 24:36.350
I DON'T WANT YOU FREEZING OUT

24:33.597 --> 24:36.350
YOUR DAD BECAUSE I AM.

24:36.392 --> 24:38.018
I'M NOT.

24:38.060 --> 24:40.813
I'M FINE IF YOU WANT

24:38.060 --> 24:40.813
THINGS THE WAY THEY WERE.

24:40.854 --> 24:42.440
THAT WOULD BE HARD

24:40.854 --> 24:42.440
THIS TIME.

24:42.522 --> 24:44.942
OKAY. MAYBE NOT NOW,

24:42.522 --> 24:44.942
BUT EVENTUALLY.

24:44.984 --> 24:46.193
EVENTUALLY, MAYBE.

24:46.235 --> 24:48.195
BUT FOR NOW,

24:46.235 --> 24:48.195
SOLIDARITY, SISTER.

24:48.237 --> 24:50.614
YA-YA!

24:48.237 --> 24:50.614
YOU'VE BEEN WAITING

24:48.237 --> 24:50.614
TO DO THAT.

24:50.656 --> 24:52.741
YA-YA!

24:50.656 --> 24:52.741
I'LL JUST BE A MINUTE.

24:52.783 --> 24:53.784
OKAY.

25:05.379 --> 25:06.922
SEE? 3 MINUTES FASTER.

25:06.964 --> 25:09.716
I ALSO FOUND A WAY TO GET

25:06.964 --> 25:09.716
TO AL'S PANCAKE WORLD

25:09.758 --> 25:11.844
THAT SHAVES 40 SECONDS

25:09.758 --> 25:11.844
OFF OUR NORMAL ROUTE.

25:11.885 --> 25:13.887
YOU WERE REALLY BORED

25:11.885 --> 25:13.887
WHEN I WAS GONE?

25:13.929 --> 25:15.597
YOU HAVE NO IDEA.

25:15.639 --> 25:19.601
Jackson: ARE YOU CRAZY?!

25:15.639 --> 25:19.601
HAVE YOU LOST YOUR MIND?!

25:19.643 --> 25:21.770
Sookie: I DON'T UNDERSTAND

25:19.643 --> 25:21.770
WHY YOU'RE SO UPSET.

25:21.812 --> 25:25.899
HOW CAN YOU NOT UNDERSTAND?!

25:21.812 --> 25:25.899
I TOLD YOU A 1,000 TIMES!

25:25.941 --> 25:27.693
I THOUGHT YOU WERE

25:25.941 --> 25:27.693
JUST BEING NICE.

25:27.734 --> 25:29.653
NICE?! SOOKIE,

25:27.734 --> 25:29.653
LOOK AT THIS PLACE!

25:29.695 --> 25:31.780
OH, JEEZ.

25:29.695 --> 25:31.780
IT LOOKS NICE.

25:31.822 --> 25:35.034
NICE. THIS IS NICE.

25:31.822 --> 25:35.034
THIS IS NICE?!

25:35.075 --> 25:36.910
WELL, IT'S MASCULINE.

25:36.952 --> 25:38.620
NO, IT'S TERRIFYING!

25:38.662 --> 25:41.707
I'll COME OUT IN THE MIDDLE

25:38.662 --> 25:41.707
OF THE NIGHT FOR A DRINK,

25:41.748 --> 25:43.834
TURN AROUND, HIT THE FLOOR,

25:41.748 --> 25:43.834
AND PLAY DEAD!

25:43.876 --> 25:45.878
SO WE HAVE

25:43.876 --> 25:45.878
A LITTLE WORK TO DO.

25:45.919 --> 25:47.671
PUT IT

25:45.919 --> 25:47.671
BACK THE WAY IT WAS.

25:47.713 --> 25:49.173
NO!

25:47.713 --> 25:49.173
I WANT YOU HAPPY!

25:49.215 --> 25:51.342
I<i> WAS</i> HAPPY!

25:49.215 --> 25:51.342
I SAID I WAS HAPPY!

25:51.384 --> 25:54.178
YOU JUST DIDN'T WANT

25:51.384 --> 25:54.178
TO BELIEVE I WAS HAPPY!

25:54.220 --> 25:55.553
WE'LL JUST CHECK ON THEM

25:54.220 --> 25:55.553
A LITTLE LATER.

25:55.595 --> 25:57.056

26:26.960 --> 26:28.670
NOT YET, KIRK.

26:28.712 --> 26:30.964

26:28.712 --> 26:30.964
NOTHING OF MAJOR CONCERN.

IT SEEMS THAT

26:31.006 --> 26:33.133
WITH CONTINUAL USE,

26:33.175 --> 26:35.428
THE CREAM DEVELOPS SOME WEIRD

REACTIONS TO LIGHT

26:35.469 --> 26:38.138

26:40.474 --> 26:42.560
I HAVE 3 CASES

26:40.474 --> 26:42.560

26:42.600 --> 26:45.396
GET RID OF IT, BUT DON'T

26:42.600 --> 26:45.396
THROW IT IN THE TRASH.

26:45.438 --> 26:46.939
THAT WOULD BE

26:45.438 --> 26:46.939
AN EPA VIOLATION.

26:46.980 --> 26:48.815
WHAT SHOULD I

26:46.980 --> 26:48.815
DO WITH IT?

26:48.857 --> 26:50.901
SHOOTING IT INTO SPACE

26:48.857 --> 26:50.901

PRETTY BIG-CITY,

NO.

27:25.478 --> 27:26.812
I'M BEING NICE HERE.

27:26.853 --> 27:29.106
YOU HAVE AN OPINION

27:26.853 --> 27:29.106
ON EVERYTHING.

27:29.148 --> 27:30.899
NOTHING IS EVER

27:29.148 --> 27:30.899
UP TO YOUR STANDARDS.

27:30.941 --> 27:32.610
THAT IS NOT TRUE.

27:32.650 --> 27:34.820
I'M SURE THESE GUYS ARE

27:32.650 --> 27:34.820
ALL GREAT BARBERS.

27:34.861 --> 27:36.780
I DON'T KNOW WHY I BOTHER.

27:36.822 --> 27:41.201
THAT IS IT. I HAVE BEEN NICE

27:36.822 --> 27:41.201
FOR THE LAST --

27:41.243 --> 27:44.246
WHAT?

27:44.288 --> 27:47.833
OH. WELL, IT LOOKS LIKE

27:44.288 --> 27:47.833
HE'S GOT HIS "WHAT I DID

27:44.288 --> 27:47.833
THIS SUMMER" ESSAY

27:47.874 --> 27:49.502
ALL RESEARCHED

27:47.874 --> 27:49.502
AND READY TO GO.

27:49.543 --> 27:52.004
I GUESS YOU DODGED

27:49.543 --> 27:52.004
A BULLET THERE, HUH?

27:52.045 --> 27:53.964
JUST SEEMS KIND OF LUCKY

27:54.006 --> 27:57.551
YOU DIDN'T THROW EVERYTHING AWAY

27:54.006 --> 27:57.551
FOR JESS WHEN YOU SEE --

27:57.593 --> 27:59.512
SEE WHAT?

27:57.593 --> 27:59.512
WHAT AM I SEEING?

27:59.553 --> 28:01.263
YOU'RE UPSET.

27:59.553 --> 28:01.263
NO. I'M NOT UPSET.

28:01.305 --> 28:03.599
YES, YOU ARE UPSET.

28:01.305 --> 28:03.599
YOU LOOK LIKE MY MOTHER.

28:03.641 --> 28:05.142
THANKS A LOT.

28:03.641 --> 28:05.142
YOU LIKE HER.

28:05.184 --> 28:06.644
YES, BUT YOU DON'T.

28:06.684 --> 28:09.271
SO IT'S NOT A COMPLIMENT.

28:09.313 --> 28:10.772
HONEY, WHAT IS WRONG?

28:10.814 --> 28:11.773
OH, GOD!

28:11.815 --> 28:13.900
WHAT IS IT?

28:11.815 --> 28:13.900
IT'S THAT.

28:13.942 --> 28:15.152
JESS?

28:13.942 --> 28:15.152
YES.

28:15.194 --> 28:16.945
YOU'RE UPSET ABOUT JESS?

28:15.194 --> 28:16.945
I SAID, "YES."

28:16.987 --> 28:18.947
YES, IT'S JESS.

28:16.987 --> 28:18.947
YOU'RE NOT BEING FUNNY.

28:18.989 --> 28:21.241
IT'S NOT MY FAULT THAT "YES"

28:18.989 --> 28:21.241
AND "JESS" RHYME.

28:21.283 --> 28:23.327
DID I EXPLOIT THE OPPORTUNITY?

28:21.283 --> 28:23.327
OF COURSE, BUT...

28:23.369 --> 28:26.246
RORY, COME ON.

28:23.369 --> 28:26.246
I KNOW YOU HAD THIS CRUSH.

28:26.288 --> 28:29.249
IT WASN'T A CRUSH.

28:26.288 --> 28:29.249
I THOUGHT IT WAS OVER.

28:29.291 --> 28:33.003
YOU HAVEN'T TALKED TO HIM

28:29.291 --> 28:33.003
SINCE...

28:29.291 --> 28:33.003
SOOKIE'S WEDDING.

28:33.045 --> 28:36.840
HE WASN'T THERE.

28:33.045 --> 28:36.840
HE WAS. HE HAD JUST COME

28:33.045 --> 28:36.840
BACK, AND CAME TO SEE ME.

28:36.882 --> 28:38.634
OKAY, SO HE<i> CRASHED</i>

28:36.882 --> 28:38.634
SOOKIE'S WEDDING, AND?

28:38.676 --> 28:41.428
AND NOTHING. HE TOLD ME

28:38.676 --> 28:41.428
THAT HE WAS BACK IN TOWN,

28:41.470 --> 28:43.430
THAT HE MOVED BACK

28:41.470 --> 28:43.430
AND...

28:43.472 --> 28:45.349
WHAT, RORY? COME ON.

28:45.391 --> 28:46.725
AND WE KISSED, OKAY?

28:46.766 --> 28:48.477
YOU KISSED?

28:46.766 --> 28:48.477
YES.

28:48.519 --> 28:51.146
YOU KISSED

28:48.519 --> 28:51.146
LIKE YOU KISSED?

28:48.519 --> 28:51.146
YES.

28:51.188 --> 28:53.106
OKAY, WHO KISSED WHO?

28:53.148 --> 28:54.941
WHAT DOES THAT MATTER?

28:54.983 --> 28:58.278
DID HE KISS YOU?

28:54.983 --> 28:58.278
DID YOU KISS EACH OTHER?

28:58.320 --> 29:00.573
I KISSED HIM.

28:58.320 --> 29:00.573
OKAY.

29:00.614 --> 29:03.116
I THOUGHT HE CAME BACK HERE

29:00.614 --> 29:03.116
BECAUSE HE LIKED ME.

29:03.158 --> 29:05.160
I KISSED HIM,

29:03.158 --> 29:05.160
AND HE KISSED ME BACK.

29:05.202 --> 29:08.497
AND NOW HE'S OVER THERE,

29:05.202 --> 29:08.497
AND I FEEL SO STUPID.

29:08.539 --> 29:11.208
THAT GIRL ISN'T EVEN

29:08.539 --> 29:11.208
HIS TYPE AND...

29:11.250 --> 29:13.586
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

29:11.250 --> 29:13.586
I'M RANTING.

29:13.627 --> 29:15.879
YOU SHOULD RECOGNIZE THIS.

29:13.627 --> 29:15.879
I LEARNED IT FROM YOU.

29:15.921 --> 29:18.173
YEAH, BUT YOU WENT TO

29:15.921 --> 29:18.173
SOOKIE'S WEDDING WITH DEAN.

29:18.215 --> 29:20.800
AND THEN YOU RAN OFF

29:18.215 --> 29:20.800
TO HAVE SOMETHING WITH JESS.

29:20.842 --> 29:23.345
IT WAS NOT A THING.

29:20.842 --> 29:23.345
A KISS IS A THING.

29:23.387 --> 29:25.598
IT WASN'T PLANNED.

29:23.387 --> 29:25.598
IT JUST HAPPENED.

29:25.639 --> 29:28.726
ALL THIS TIME I'M THINKING,

29:25.639 --> 29:28.726
"SHE'S WITH DEAN."

29:25.639 --> 29:28.726
I AM WITH DEAN.

29:28.767 --> 29:30.769
KISSING ANOTHER GUY

29:28.767 --> 29:30.769
IS NOT BEING WITH DEAN.

29:30.810 --> 29:32.312
ASK HIM.

29:30.810 --> 29:32.312
HE'D BACK ME UP.

29:32.354 --> 29:34.356
IT WAS NOTHING.

29:32.354 --> 29:34.356
WHY ARE YOU FREAKING OUT?

29:34.398 --> 29:37.735
I'M NOT FREAKED OUT.

29:34.398 --> 29:37.735
KID, YOU HAVE GOT TO MAKE UP

29:34.398 --> 29:37.735
YOUR MIND.

29:37.776 --> 29:39.861
JESS, DEAN. JESS, DEAN.

29:37.776 --> 29:39.861
IT'S ENOUGH ALREADY.

29:39.903 --> 29:41.863
IF YOU WANT JESS,

29:39.903 --> 29:41.863
GO GET HIM.

29:41.905 --> 29:45.992
IF YOU THINK THAT'S THE GREAT

29:41.905 --> 29:45.992
LOVE OF YOUR LIFE, THEN GREAT.

29:46.034 --> 29:49.079
GRAB A LIVER TREAT AND A

29:46.034 --> 29:49.079
SQUEAKY TOY AND RUN TO HIM.

29:49.121 --> 29:50.706
DON'T WORRY

29:49.121 --> 29:50.706
ABOUT THAT GIRL,

29:50.748 --> 29:53.792
BECAUSE HE WILL HAVE MOVED ON

29:50.748 --> 29:53.792
TO SOMEBODY ELSE IN AN HOUR.

29:53.833 --> 29:56.670
BUT DO SOMETHING.

29:53.833 --> 29:56.670
DEAN HAS BEEN SWEET

29:56.712 --> 29:58.130
AND SUPPORTIVE

29:56.712 --> 29:58.130
AND INCREDIBLY PATIENT,

29:58.171 --> 30:01.007
AND NOW YOU'RE OFFICIALLY

29:58.171 --> 30:01.007
TREATING HIM LIKE DIRT.

30:01.049 --> 30:03.802
NOT ONLY IS THAT NOT YOU,

30:01.049 --> 30:03.802
HE DOESN'T DESERVE THAT.

30:03.843 --> 30:05.638
GOD, I WISH THEY KNEW

30:03.843 --> 30:05.638
ANOTHER SONG!

30:05.679 --> 30:07.806
I KNOW ALL THIS

30:05.679 --> 30:07.806
ABOUT DEAN.

30:07.847 --> 30:10.892
I KNOW HOW GREAT HE IS.

30:07.847 --> 30:10.892
I KNEW IT BEFORE YOU DID.

30:10.934 --> 30:12.686
KNOWING THIS HAS

30:10.934 --> 30:12.686
APPARENTLY NOT STOPPED YOU

30:12.728 --> 30:14.480
DRAGGING HIS HEART

30:12.728 --> 30:14.480
ALL OVER THIS TOWN.

30:14.521 --> 30:16.856
NOT FAIR!

30:14.521 --> 30:16.856
YES, FAIR. THE FAIREST.

30:16.898 --> 30:18.942
I DON'T WANNA TALK ABOUT THIS.

30:18.984 --> 30:23.280
IF YOU DON'T WANT TO BE WITH

30:18.984 --> 30:23.280
HIM, CUT HIM LOOSE. LET HIM FIND

30:18.984 --> 30:23.280
SOMEONE WHO DOES.

30:23.322 --> 30:26.366
BECAUSE THIS IS JUST

30:23.322 --> 30:26.366
SO...WRONG.

30:26.408 --> 30:28.452
ALL RIGHT!

30:26.408 --> 30:28.452
I GET IT! JUST STOP!

30:28.494 --> 30:29.662
RORY.

30:31.371 --> 30:32.998
HEY.

30:31.371 --> 30:32.998
HI DEAN..

30:33.039 --> 30:35.542
I THOUGHT YOUR PLANE

30:33.039 --> 30:35.542
DIDN'T GET IN UNTIL 6:00.

30:35.584 --> 30:37.377
I MANAGED TO GET

30:35.584 --> 30:37.377
AN EARLIER FLIGHT.

30:37.419 --> 30:39.421
WELL, I'M OFF TO DINNER

30:37.419 --> 30:39.421
WITH MY PARENTS.

30:39.463 --> 30:41.089
DO YOU...

30:39.463 --> 30:41.089
SHE'S OFF THE HOOK.

30:41.131 --> 30:43.717
YOU GUYS HAVE ALL NIGHT

30:41.131 --> 30:43.717
TO TALK. ENJOY.

30:43.759 --> 30:45.260
GOOD TO HAVE YOU BACK,

30:43.759 --> 30:45.260
DEAN.

30:45.302 --> 30:47.513
THANKS.

30:45.302 --> 30:47.513
SEE YOU LATER.

30:47.554 --> 30:49.848
SO, DID I

30:47.554 --> 30:49.848
INTERRUPT SOMETHING?

30:49.889 --> 30:52.810
NO, NOTHING.

30:49.889 --> 30:52.810
WE WERE JUST...

30:52.851 --> 30:54.353
HI. YOU'RE BACK.

30:54.394 --> 30:56.896
I'M BACK, AND I'M GLAD

30:54.394 --> 30:56.896
TO FIND YOU NOT BLONDE.

30:56.938 --> 30:59.149
I WAS JUST HAVING

30:56.938 --> 30:59.149
WAY TOO MUCH FUN.

30:59.191 --> 31:00.776
I MISSED YOU.

31:00.818 --> 31:01.901
I MISSED YOU, TOO.

31:07.366 --> 31:12.162
♪ YOU WISH THAT SUMMER

31:07.366 --> 31:12.162
COULD ALWAYS BE HERE ♪♪

31:19.586 --> 31:21.547
LORELAI,

31:19.586 --> 31:21.547
NICE TO SEE YOU.

31:21.588 --> 31:22.673
SORRY I'M LATE, MOM.

31:22.715 --> 31:24.257
NO, DON'T BE SORRY.

31:24.299 --> 31:27.386
THAT'S WHAT THE WARM SETTING

31:24.299 --> 31:27.386
WAS INVENTED FOR.

31:27.427 --> 31:29.847
RICHARD, LORELAI'S HERE.

31:29.888 --> 31:32.391
MOM, BEFORE WE GET THE EVENING

31:29.888 --> 31:32.391
STARTED AND ALL,

31:32.432 --> 31:33.933
I WANT TO TELL YOU

31:32.432 --> 31:33.933
SOMETHING.

31:33.975 --> 31:36.603
TELL ME OUTSIDE.

31:33.975 --> 31:36.603
NO. I'LL JUST DO IT HERE.

31:36.645 --> 31:40.566
THERE'S JUST SOMETHING ABOUT

31:36.645 --> 31:40.566
STANDING NEAR THE EXIT THAT'S

31:36.645 --> 31:40.566
WORKING FOR ME.

31:40.607 --> 31:43.819
YOU DON'T DISCUSS THINGS

31:40.607 --> 31:43.819
STANDING BY A DOOR.

31:43.861 --> 31:46.112
I MAY HAVE TO TAKE

31:43.861 --> 31:46.112
ONE MORE CALL TONIGHT.

31:46.154 --> 31:48.615
BEN STELLEN AND I GOT CUT OFF.

31:46.154 --> 31:48.615
HELLO, LORELAI.

31:48.657 --> 31:50.659
COME OUTSIDE WITH US

31:48.657 --> 31:50.659
UNTIL HE CALLS BACK.

31:50.701 --> 31:52.327
LORELAI'S ABOUT TO TELL US

31:50.701 --> 31:52.327
SOMETHING.

31:52.369 --> 31:55.914
OH, PERHAPS THAT SHE'S DECIDED

31:52.369 --> 31:55.914
TO BUY AN ACCURATE TIMEPIECE.

31:55.955 --> 31:59.376
OH, NOW, RICHARD.

31:55.955 --> 31:59.376
IS RORY OKAY?

31:59.418 --> 32:02.629
OH, YES, RORY'S FINE.

31:59.418 --> 32:02.629
EVERYTHING'S FINE.

31:59.418 --> 32:02.629
IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL.

32:02.671 --> 32:04.631
WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE

32:02.671 --> 32:04.631
TO DRINK?

32:02.671 --> 32:04.631
WHATEVER.

32:04.673 --> 32:08.093
I CAN'T READ MINDS.

32:04.673 --> 32:08.093
I DON'T CARE, DAD.

32:04.673 --> 32:08.093
WHATEVER YOU HAVE.

32:08.134 --> 32:12.013
WE HAVE EVERYTHING.

32:08.134 --> 32:12.013
ALL RIGHT, I'LL HAVE A

32:08.134 --> 32:12.013
JAGERMEISTER AND A JELLO SHOT.

32:12.055 --> 32:13.724
EXCUSE ME?

32:12.055 --> 32:13.724
WHITE WINE.

32:13.766 --> 32:17.185
ALL RIGHT.

32:13.766 --> 32:17.185
SIT. SIT.

32:17.227 --> 32:20.980
NOW GO AHEAD.

32:17.227 --> 32:20.980
TELL US.

32:21.022 --> 32:22.023
OKAY, WELL --

32:22.065 --> 32:23.983
OH! WAIT JUST A SECOND.

32:24.025 --> 32:27.070
WE BROUGHT YOU SOMETHING

32:24.025 --> 32:27.070
FROM MARTHA'S VINEYARD.

32:24.025 --> 32:27.070
OH, THAT'S GREAT.

32:27.112 --> 32:32.158
MAYBE WE COULD JUST -- OKAY.

32:27.112 --> 32:32.158
I GUESS IT'S PRESENT TIME.

32:27.112 --> 32:32.158
OPEN IT.

32:32.200 --> 32:34.119
[ CHUCKLES ]

32:34.160 --> 32:36.288
SCONE MIX. WOW.

32:36.329 --> 32:39.082
THIS NEW LITTLE PLACE OPENED

32:36.329 --> 32:39.082
DOWN THE ROAD FROM OUR HOUSE,

32:39.124 --> 32:42.168
AND THEY MAKE

32:39.124 --> 32:42.168
THESE WONDERFUL SCONES.

32:39.124 --> 32:42.168
AND THAT IS THEIR MIX,

32:42.210 --> 32:45.505
SO YOU CAN MAKE THEM

32:42.210 --> 32:45.505
IN YOUR OWN KITCHEN.

32:42.210 --> 32:45.505
THANKS, MOM.

32:45.547 --> 32:49.593
I WILL PUT THIS ON THE COUNTER

32:45.547 --> 32:49.593
AND STARE AT IT FOR MANY YEARS

32:45.547 --> 32:49.593
TO COME.

32:49.635 --> 32:52.137
YOU'RE NOT GOING

32:49.635 --> 32:52.137
TO MAKE THEM?

32:49.635 --> 32:52.137
I'M NOT A BAKER.

32:52.178 --> 32:54.807
THE INSTRUCTIONS ARE

32:52.178 --> 32:54.807
ON THE BAG.

32:52.178 --> 32:54.807
BUT STILL...

32:54.848 --> 32:57.058
THOSE ARE GOOD SCONES.

32:57.100 --> 32:59.519
I'LL GIVE THIS TO SOOKIE,

32:57.100 --> 32:59.519
AND SHE'LL BAKE THEM.

32:59.561 --> 33:02.981
I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY YOU CAN'T

32:59.561 --> 33:02.981
FOLLOW THOSE DIRECTIONS.

33:03.022 --> 33:05.191
RORY WOULD LOVE

33:03.022 --> 33:05.191
THOSE SCONES.

33:05.233 --> 33:08.821
OKAY. I PROMISE.

33:05.233 --> 33:08.821
THE SCONES WILL GET EATEN.

33:08.862 --> 33:10.614
THAT BEING SAID,

33:08.862 --> 33:10.614
CAN WE MOVE ON?

33:10.656 --> 33:13.742
FINE. GO AHEAD.

33:10.656 --> 33:13.742
TALK. WE'RE LISTENING.

33:13.784 --> 33:16.703
UM...OKAY.

33:16.745 --> 33:19.331
WELL, UM,

33:16.745 --> 33:19.331
IT'S ABOUT CHRISTOPHER.

33:19.372 --> 33:22.292
OH, THAT REMINDS ME.

33:19.372 --> 33:22.292
WE GOT HIM A CAPTAIN'S HAT.

33:22.334 --> 33:24.837
WHERE IS THAT HAT?

33:22.334 --> 33:24.837
LORELAI COULD BRING IT TO HIM.

33:24.878 --> 33:26.087
NO, I CAN'T.

33:26.129 --> 33:26.880
WHY NOT?

33:26.922 --> 33:29.466
WELL, IT'S JUST, UM...

33:29.508 --> 33:31.426
CHRIS AND I AREN'T --

33:31.468 --> 33:32.803
AREN'T WHAT?

33:32.845 --> 33:34.721
THEY AREN'T TOGETHER ANYMORE,

33:32.845 --> 33:34.721
RICHARD.

33:34.763 --> 33:36.097
WHY NOT?

33:36.139 --> 33:38.057
I'M SURE A VAGUE REASON IS

33:36.139 --> 33:38.057
FORTHCOMING.

33:38.099 --> 33:40.310
IT JUST DIDN'T WORK OUT,

33:38.099 --> 33:40.310
THAT'S ALL.

33:40.352 --> 33:42.771
AND THERE IT IS.

33:40.352 --> 33:42.771
YOU'RE DISAPPOINTED.

33:42.813 --> 33:46.149
DISAPPOINTED? OH, PLEASE.

33:42.813 --> 33:46.149
LORELAI, THIS IS RIDICULOUS.

33:46.191 --> 33:48.193
YOU AREN'T

33:46.191 --> 33:48.193
IN HIGH SCHOOL.

33:46.191 --> 33:48.193
I KNOW.

33:48.234 --> 33:49.653
LET'S NOT TALK

33:48.234 --> 33:49.653
ABOUT THIS.

33:49.695 --> 33:51.697
NO. WE ARE GOING

33:49.695 --> 33:51.697
TO TALK ABOUT IT.

33:51.738 --> 33:54.741
YOU'RE RUNNING AROUND LIKE YOU

33:51.738 --> 33:54.741
HAVE NO RESPONSIBILITY IN LIFE,

33:54.783 --> 33:57.870
LIKE YOU CAN FLIT

33:54.783 --> 33:57.870
FROM THING TO THING,

33:54.783 --> 33:57.870
FROM MAN TO MAN.

33:57.911 --> 33:59.955
I DON'T FLIT

33:57.911 --> 33:59.955
FROM MAN TO MAN.

33:59.997 --> 34:02.040
YOU HAVE A DAUGHTER.

33:59.997 --> 34:02.040
THIS AFFECTS RORY, TOO.

34:02.081 --> 34:03.667
YOU'RE WASTING

34:02.081 --> 34:03.667
YOUR BREATH.

34:03.709 --> 34:06.211
I KNOW THIS AFFECTS RORY.

34:03.709 --> 34:06.211
I'M NOT DOING THIS LIGHTLY.

34:06.252 --> 34:08.254
IN FACT, I'M NOT DOING ANYTHING

34:06.252 --> 34:08.254
AT ALL!

34:08.296 --> 34:11.049
THERE'S NO REASON

34:08.296 --> 34:11.049
TO RAISE YOUR VOICE.

34:08.296 --> 34:11.049
I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS.

34:11.090 --> 34:12.759
I WANT TO KNOW WHY!

34:12.801 --> 34:14.803
I DON'T WANT ANY

34:12.801 --> 34:14.803
OF THIS "JUST BECAUSE"

34:14.845 --> 34:16.596
AND "IT JUST DIDN'T

34:14.845 --> 34:16.596
WORK OUT" NONSENSE.

34:16.638 --> 34:20.642
I WANT A SOLID, ADULT REASON WHY

34:16.638 --> 34:20.642
THE FATHER OF MY GRANDDAUGHTER

34:20.684 --> 34:23.436
AND HER MOTHER CAN'T SEEM

34:20.684 --> 34:23.436
TO PUT A FAMILY TOGETHER.

34:23.478 --> 34:26.940
HIS GIRLFRIEND IS PREGNANT.

34:23.478 --> 34:26.940
WHAT?

34:26.982 --> 34:30.109
SHERRY IS PREGNANT.

34:26.982 --> 34:30.109
WHEN CHRISTOPHER FOUND OUT,

34:26.982 --> 34:30.109
HE WENT BACK TO HER,

34:30.151 --> 34:31.987
AND THAT, MOTHER,

34:30.151 --> 34:31.987
IS THE REASON.

34:32.029 --> 34:34.072
ARE THEY GETTING MARRIED?

34:32.029 --> 34:34.072
PROBABLY.

34:34.113 --> 34:35.991
OF COURSE THEY'RE

34:34.113 --> 34:35.991
GETTING MARRIED.

34:36.033 --> 34:37.158
HOW DO YOU KNOW?

34:37.200 --> 34:38.535
I KNOW CHRISTOPHER,

34:38.577 --> 34:40.829
AND CHRISTOPHER ALWAYS TRIES

34:38.577 --> 34:40.829
TO DO THE RIGHT THING.

34:40.871 --> 34:43.122
THE RIGHT THING IS TO BE

34:40.871 --> 34:43.122
WITH HIS FAMILY.

34:43.164 --> 34:45.124
LORELAI AND RORY ARE

34:43.164 --> 34:45.124
HIS FAMILY.

34:45.166 --> 34:48.461
HE MET HER TWO MINUTES AGO.

34:45.166 --> 34:48.461
HE IS GOING

34:45.166 --> 34:48.461
TO BE A FATHER.

34:48.503 --> 34:49.963
HE ALREADY IS A FATHER.

34:50.005 --> 34:52.424
I REALLY DON'T WANT TO DISCUSS

34:50.005 --> 34:52.424
THIS ANYMORE.

34:52.465 --> 34:55.510
LORELAI, YOU HAVE

34:52.465 --> 34:55.510
TO TALK TO HIM.

34:52.465 --> 34:55.510
THERE'S NOTHING TO TALK ABOUT.

34:55.552 --> 34:57.804
TELL HIM YOU WANT

34:55.552 --> 34:57.804
TO GET MARRIED.

34:55.552 --> 34:57.804
PLEASE, STOP.

34:57.846 --> 34:59.514
YES, EMILY.

34:57.846 --> 34:59.514
PLEASE, STOP.

34:59.556 --> 35:02.183
YOU KNOW LORELAI NEVER DOES

34:59.556 --> 35:02.183
ANYTHING UNLESS SHE WANTS TO,

35:02.225 --> 35:04.310
NO MATTER THE CONSEQUENCES

35:02.225 --> 35:04.310
TO ANYONE ELSE.

35:04.352 --> 35:07.522
WHAT'S THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

35:04.352 --> 35:07.522
LORELAI WANTS TO BE

35:04.352 --> 35:07.522
WITH CHRISTOPHER.

35:07.564 --> 35:09.066
SHE TOLD US

35:07.564 --> 35:09.066
AT THE WEDDING.

35:09.148 --> 35:11.484
YES. AND NOW THE WIND

35:09.148 --> 35:11.484
HAS CHANGED.

35:11.526 --> 35:13.904
CHRISTOPHER IS LIVING UP

35:11.526 --> 35:13.904
TO HIS RESPONSIBILITIES

35:13.946 --> 35:16.448
AS HE TRIED TO DO MANY YEARS AGO

35:13.946 --> 35:16.448
WITH LORELAI.

35:16.489 --> 35:19.158
SHE TURNED HIM DOWN.

35:16.489 --> 35:19.158
I WAS 16.

35:19.200 --> 35:21.369
IF CHRISTOPHER

35:19.200 --> 35:21.369
HAS FOUND SOMEONE

35:21.411 --> 35:22.996
WHO WILL ACTUALLY ALLOW HIM

35:23.038 --> 35:25.874
TO BE A FATHER

35:23.038 --> 35:25.874
TO HIS OWN CHILD,

35:25.916 --> 35:28.085
THEN THAT'S WHAT

35:25.916 --> 35:28.085
HE'S GOING TO DO.

35:28.126 --> 35:29.086
YOU SUPPORT THIS?
