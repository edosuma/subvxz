so the victim's name

03:58.977 --> 04:00.762
is Elliot Young, he was 46,

04:00.805 --> 04:03.155
unemployed auto mechanic,
army vet,

04:03.199 --> 04:05.723
former EOD technician.
Means he's a bomb expert.

04:05.767 --> 04:07.551
- Yeah, he had chemicals,
fuses,

04:07.595 --> 04:08.813
and homemade blasting caps.

04:08.857 --> 04:10.206
So our bomb team
is analyzing now,

04:10.250 --> 04:11.294
but based on what they saw,
they think

04:11.338 --> 04:12.382
that he likely made

04:12.426 --> 04:14.123
one large ammonium nitrate
bomb.

04:14.166 --> 04:16.691
- Which was not found
in the house.

04:16.734 --> 04:18.388
So that means the killer
likely took off

04:18.432 --> 04:20.347

The question is, why?

04:20.390 --> 04:22.827
Why kill Young?
Why not just pay for it?

police scrutiny?

04:24.612 --> 04:26.353
Signor Moran,
you have anything done?

04:26.396 --> 04:28.006
- Yeah, I've been digging
through his financials,

04:28.050 --> 04:30.139
and he definitely has
some problems.

04:30.182 --> 04:31.532
He defaulted
on his home mortgage,

04:31.575 --> 04:33.098
and he's
over 90 days delinquent

04:33.142 --> 04:34.230
on two credit cards.

04:34.274 --> 04:35.362
- Okay, so maybe
he's making bombs

04:35.405 --> 04:38.103
to make money,
not to further a cause

04:38.147 --> 04:39.496
or political agenda.

04:39.540 --> 04:41.455
- Hey, I just talked to DHS.
- Yeah.

04:41.498 --> 04:42.586
- There's no chatter
about the shooting

04:42.630 --> 04:45.285
or any imminent
terrorist attack.

04:45.328 --> 04:47.417
If the shooter is a terrorist,

04:47.461 --> 04:49.114
and the bomb was taken
to support

04:49.158 --> 04:51.160
some upcoming terror event,

04:51.203 --> 04:53.380
it's most likely a small group,

off the radar

04:55.207 --> 04:57.035
of the intelligence community.

12:13.907 --> 12:15.169
to attract investors

12:15.212 --> 12:17.998
so that they can make
longer movies.

12:21.958 --> 12:24.787
That's what they told me,
anyway.

12:24.831 --> 12:27.529
- And you were planning
to meet Ernesto

12:27.572 --> 12:29.226
and give him that money today?

12:29.270 --> 12:30.793
- I actually was supposed
to do it yesterday,

12:30.837 --> 12:32.882
but I had a hard time
getting the money

12:32.926 --> 12:34.405
out of my 401k.

12:34.449 --> 12:37.104
Took longer than I thought.

12:37.147 --> 12:38.888
Alberto was really upset.

12:38.932 --> 12:41.151
He needed the money
to make a deposit

12:41.195 --> 12:43.719
on a studio space
he was trying to rent.

12:43.763 --> 12:45.155
- Upset over being a day late.

12:45.199 --> 12:48.202
Must be a reason.
Maybe there's a clock on this.

12:48.245 --> 12:49.638
- Maybe it's tied
to an event--

12:49.681 --> 12:53.076
anniversary or holiday.
- Yeah.

12:53.120 --> 12:54.295
- What time you supposed
to meet

12:54.338 --> 12:56.645
his partner Ernesto?

12:56.688 --> 12:59.039
- 11:30.

13:01.128 --> 13:03.304
- Poor woman is blind.

13:03.347 --> 13:04.566
- But what is
this 30 grand about?

13:04.609 --> 13:06.220
I mean, was Felix just looking
for cash

13:06.263 --> 13:07.569
to help finance the movement?

13:07.612 --> 13:08.918
- Or finance the purchase
of a bomb.

13:08.962 --> 13:09.963
That's probably why
he was so mad

13:10.006 --> 13:11.573
about the money being late.

13:11.616 --> 13:13.444
- Why not wait another day?

13:13.488 --> 13:15.490
- Because he couldn't.
- Why not?

13:15.533 --> 13:17.622
- It looks like the attack
was tied to the birthday

13:17.666 --> 13:19.102
of another Venezuelan
terrorist,

13:19.146 --> 13:20.756
Ilich Ramirez Sanchez.

13:20.800 --> 13:23.150
- Carlos the Jackal?
- Yeah.

13:23.193 --> 13:26.240
Today is his birthday,
which is probably why

13:26.283 --> 13:28.633
Felix couldn't wait.
He knew the clock was ticking.

13:28.677 --> 13:30.548
- And what better way
to celebrate

13:30.592 --> 13:32.507
the Jackal's birthday
than to blow up

13:32.550 --> 13:34.726
a symbol
of American capitalism.

13:37.207 --> 13:38.774
- So now what?

13:38.818 --> 13:40.471
- Now we let Hannah take
that business meeting

13:40.515 --> 13:41.733
with Ernesto.

13:44.345 --> 13:46.260
- Just stay calm, okay?

13:46.303 --> 13:50.003
Hand Ernesto the money,
and we'll arrest him.

13:50.046 --> 13:51.831
- I still think you're wrong.

13:51.874 --> 13:54.311
There's no way Alberto
could have killed someone.

13:54.355 --> 13:55.356
Or is a terrorist.

13:55.399 --> 13:57.053
- Look, his real name
is Felix.

13:57.097 --> 13:58.881

That much we know for sure.

13:58.925 --> 13:59.882
Here.

13:59.926 --> 14:01.057
We also know he's a member

14:01.101 --> 14:02.885
of a violent socialist
organization,

14:02.929 --> 14:04.887
that he used your car
to commit a murder,

14:04.931 --> 14:06.497

in possession

14:06.541 --> 14:10.284
