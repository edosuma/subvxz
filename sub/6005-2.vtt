01:04.800 --> 01:06.597
- You cow!
- (Screams)

01:06.640 --> 01:07.914
You bitch!

01:07.960 --> 01:10.076
(Both screaming)

01:11.080 --> 01:13.196
<i>You stop it, I'II...</i>

01:14.240 --> 01:16.549
- Ah, you...
- (Screams)

01:17.600 --> 01:20.034
Get off me!

01:21.600 --> 01:23.397
Can't you stop them?

01:25.640 --> 01:27.358
Stop it, you two.

01:27.400 --> 01:29.391
<i>You're ruining your father's breakfast.</i>

01:29.440 --> 01:30.429
Peter?

01:32.120 --> 01:33.235
Mm.

01:33.280 --> 01:34.633
- Where is he?
- Excuse me.

01:34.680 --> 01:36.272
I don't know.

01:36.320 --> 01:37.514
Auriel's on the phone.

01:37.560 --> 01:39.198
Says she's got a situation.

01:39.240 --> 01:40.992
Perhaps he's overslept.

01:41.040 --> 01:42.712
I'll go and see.

01:42.760 --> 01:45.354
Auriel. I will get him to call you back.

01:49.880 --> 01:51.029
(Snoring)

01:54.560 --> 01:55.231
(Screams)

01:56.280 --> 01:58.874
My God. I forbid you to scream like that again.

01:58.920 --> 02:00.273
Simon!

02:00.320 --> 02:02.311
God, it's morning.

02:02.360 --> 02:04.351
SIMON: <i>What's the matter, Bea?</i>

02:04.400 --> 02:07.358
Don't talk to me, you suicide-faking freak.

02:07.400 --> 02:08.594
Do you need a coffee?

02:08.639 --> 02:10.631
Oh, yes. As strong as you can make it.

02:10.680 --> 02:12.557
And Gloria...

02:12.600 --> 02:16.036
Outside the family, no-one is to know he's back.
Do you understand?

02:16.080 --> 02:19.152
Beatrice, did you hear what I just said?
No-one is to know.

02:19.200 --> 02:21.236
Why are you telling me? He's not my problem.

02:30.280 --> 02:32.669
You do know you'll have to go to the police,
don't you?

02:32.720 --> 02:35.314
Yeah, I know.

02:35.360 --> 02:38.158
Just give me a couple of days. Please.

02:38.200 --> 02:40.191
Two days.

02:40.240 --> 02:42.959
Yes, I'll tell them the truth. I was depressed.

02:43.000 --> 02:44.991
Slap on the wrist. No big deal.

02:45.040 --> 02:49.955
No big deal?! Simon, you stole someone's
identity. That's an arrestable offence.

02:50.000 --> 02:52.753
What you did is against the law.

02:52.800 --> 02:56.270
And if you're seen, we will be implicated.
Do you understand?

02:56.320 --> 02:58.675
(Baby cries)

02:58.720 --> 03:00.358
What's that?

03:00.400 --> 03:02.516
Ah. Yes.

03:03.400 --> 03:06.631
There's something
I didn't quite get round to telling you last night.

03:08.040 --> 03:09.951
Oh, morning, you.

03:11.160 --> 03:12.309
Thanks for last night.

03:12.360 --> 03:14.351
Yeah, Honor... Um.

03:15.360 --> 03:16.679
Upstairs.

03:18.560 --> 03:20.152
I'm not supposed to know.

03:21.840 --> 03:25.719
Peter, you old rascal. Have you got yourself
a wife? Big-boned, is she?

03:25.760 --> 03:27.193
No.

03:27.240 --> 03:28.912
No, no, no. He's not mine.

03:28.960 --> 03:30.837
Whose is he?

03:30.880 --> 03:31.869
Yours.

03:32.920 --> 03:34.911
Mine?

03:38.440 --> 03:39.839
Who's the mother?

03:39.880 --> 03:41.871
<i>Don't worry. I'm coming.</i>

03:41.920 --> 03:43.797
You are not to upset her.

03:45.680 --> 03:46.749
Honor!

03:46.800 --> 03:49.360
- Oh, my God. Christopher.
- Simon.

03:49.400 --> 03:51.391
You never told me you were pregnant.

03:51.440 --> 03:53.351
This is no time for an argument.

03:53.400 --> 03:55.834
Why didn't you tell me?

03:55.880 --> 03:58.394
- What are you doing here?
- Me? I thought you were dead.

03:58.440 --> 04:00.078
I thought you were on the pill.

04:00.120 --> 04:02.714
Look, I've got clients. You stay out of sight.

04:04.600 --> 04:06.989
I'll be downstairs if you want me.

04:08.440 --> 04:10.396
We will talk later.

04:19.839 --> 04:21.831
Ooh, thank you.

04:21.880 --> 04:23.632
Are you sure you don't want the day off?

04:23.680 --> 04:26.877
I could take over for the day
if you're feeling hungover.

04:26.920 --> 04:28.911
That won't be necessary, thank you.

04:28.960 --> 04:32.077
Make sure he doesn't come downstairs.
I don't trust him.

04:32.120 --> 04:34.111
I didn't, even before he died.

04:34.160 --> 04:36.151
What are you going to do?

04:37.280 --> 04:40.238
Um, clients come first, Gloria.
Without them, we're nothing.

04:40.280 --> 04:43.909
Alf and Linda Appleby are in your office.

04:43.960 --> 04:45.598
Ted sent them over.

04:46.600 --> 04:49.751
And Auriel is desperate to
speak to you on the phone.

04:49.800 --> 04:53.395
Jim Wright's daughter Patricia
has attacked her father's nurse.

04:53.440 --> 04:57.274
(Sighs) Appleby? Appleby is first, then, I think.

05:00.000 --> 05:01.831
Gordon Bennett!

05:01.880 --> 05:04.155
They're aprons, Lyle.

05:04.200 --> 05:06.191
Would you like some coats?

05:06.240 --> 05:08.800
No, thank you. We're fine. We're naturists.

05:08.840 --> 05:12.037
The council are trying to ban us from the beach.

05:12.080 --> 05:15.436
Uh-huh? Which beach?

05:19.920 --> 05:21.672
Lady Rosenbloom?

05:22.480 --> 05:23.959
That's me.

05:27.880 --> 05:29.279
You can call me Veronica.

05:29.320 --> 05:30.992
That's fine.

05:32.160 --> 05:34.879
Our club has been using that beach
for over 20 years.

05:34.920 --> 05:36.478
It's always been a naturist place.

05:36.520 --> 05:39.193
But now the council won't let us use the car park.

05:39.240 --> 05:43.836
They've got themselves a warden,
and he's writing down our number plates.

05:43.880 --> 05:45.598
What exactly is their objection?

05:45.640 --> 05:48.473
The new residents are complaining.

05:48.520 --> 05:50.272
There's no law against nudity per se.

05:50.320 --> 05:53.198
Why would there be? It's wonderfully liberating.

05:53.240 --> 05:55.390
We are respectable members of the community.

05:55.440 --> 05:56.873
My husband is a police officer.

05:56.920 --> 05:59.150
Yes, I'm aware of that.

05:59.200 --> 06:02.033
It's one of the reasons
I'm having difficulty concentrating.

06:03.160 --> 06:04.957
Oh, sorry.

06:05.000 --> 06:06.991
- Sorry.
- I'm so sorry.

06:08.840 --> 06:10.876
Where do I know him from?

06:10.920 --> 06:15.311
What part of "you cannot be seen by anyone"
do you find difficult to understand?

06:15.360 --> 06:18.830
That naked man in there is Sergeant Appleby,
a police officer.

06:18.880 --> 06:20.871
I didn't know you were with a client.

06:20.920 --> 06:22.990
Well, I did, but I didn't know where...

06:23.040 --> 06:25.315
You've changed everything around.

06:25.360 --> 06:28.909
Just stay out of sight
until I can think of what to do with you.

06:28.960 --> 06:31.474
All right. I'll go and help Honor with Johnny.

06:31.520 --> 06:34.876
- Danny.
- Daniel, actually.

06:34.920 --> 06:36.035
I spoke to the council.

06:36.080 --> 06:38.833
They said the people living
beside the car park have a problem

06:38.880 --> 06:41.952
with your naturists wandering around starkers.

06:42.000 --> 06:45.151
So, you're back, are you? Great!

06:45.200 --> 06:47.077
I know he's your brother. Gloria told me.

06:47.120 --> 06:49.953
Well, he is practically family.

06:50.000 --> 06:50.989
Does Honor know?

06:51.040 --> 06:53.793
I'm sorry. Who's this?

06:53.840 --> 06:55.831
Lyle is our trainee.

06:55.880 --> 06:58.075
Yes, but I'm also now an accomplice to fraud.

06:58.120 --> 06:59.917
His crime could ruin my reputation.

06:59.960 --> 07:02.599
You don't have a reputation, Lyle.
You're not qualified.

07:02.640 --> 07:04.949
Look, I'm sorry, it isn't your problem, all right?

07:05.000 --> 07:08.390
Peter! Jim Wright's daughter Patricia
is on the phone.

07:08.440 --> 07:12.319
You. Naked people, now, before they get a chill.

07:12.360 --> 07:14.920
And you, up the stairs, and not a squeak.

08:00.520 --> 08:04.035
Have you brought your boxing gloves
and your gum shields?

08:04.080 --> 08:06.071
I've never seen anything like it.

08:06.120 --> 08:08.236
Patricia went absolutely mental.

08:08.280 --> 08:10.714
Ooh. Better keep my voice down.

08:10.760 --> 08:13.399
I've seen that look before, Peter.

08:13.440 --> 08:16.910
It's either sexual frustration
or you're constipated.

08:17.920 --> 08:19.990
Well, Aunt, I have got some big news.

08:21.040 --> 08:22.393
Simon's back.

08:25.840 --> 08:28.479
The sneaky little shit.

08:30.040 --> 08:31.917
- Patricia.
- Peter.

08:31.960 --> 08:33.518
How's your father?

08:33.559 --> 08:34.549
Not well.

08:34.600 --> 08:37.672
He's come back from the cardiac clinic
with a new private nurse.

08:37.720 --> 08:39.278
Well, that's lovely.

08:39.320 --> 08:41.311
No. A real little gold digger.

08:41.360 --> 08:42.712
Didn't Auriel tell you?

08:42.760 --> 08:44.751
She attacked me this morning.

08:44.800 --> 08:47.792
The way I heard it, it was the other way round.

08:47.840 --> 08:49.671
Filling his head with nonsense.

08:49.720 --> 08:52.473
She's calling herself his girlfriend.

08:52.520 --> 08:57.036
Now, I know you're very fond of my father,
as am I, Peter.

08:57.080 --> 08:59.878
- I want you to give her this.
- Oh, now...

08:59.920 --> 09:01.353
She's only in it for the money.

09:01.400 --> 09:03.709
- L10,000 should see her off.
- A bribe?!

09:03.760 --> 09:08.675
Pay-off. Compensation
for losing the new love of her life.

09:08.720 --> 09:10.551
Patricia, I can't be a party to this.

09:10.600 --> 09:15.549
I love my father, and if you don't do this, I will.

09:17.160 --> 09:19.833
What's your diagnosis, Doctor? Is it serious?

09:21.520 --> 09:24.398
Well, in five months' time
you're going to have a baby.

09:26.040 --> 09:28.190
I'm pregnant?

09:28.240 --> 09:29.958
Yes.

09:34.160 --> 09:36.993
- No, really?
- Yes.

09:38.760 --> 09:40.751
<i>You're going to be a mother.</i>

10:02.560 --> 10:05.916
It's amazing what you've done with this place,
isn't it?

10:05.960 --> 10:07.029
(Door opens)

10:07.080 --> 10:09.071
MAN: <i>Mr Kingdom!</i>

10:11.200 --> 10:12.189
Sh.

10:12.240 --> 10:13.719
MAN: <i>Mr Kingdom!</i>

10:16.680 --> 10:18.033
Oh, Mrs Millington.

10:18.080 --> 10:21.197
I'm sorry, Sidney.
You're not really allowed in today.

10:21.240 --> 10:23.356
May I give you a call later?

10:23.400 --> 10:24.628
Well...

10:24.680 --> 10:25.715
Oh!

10:29.720 --> 10:30.914
Ah!

10:30.960 --> 10:33.076
So Patricia spoke to you?

10:33.120 --> 10:35.350
Or are you just checking that I'm still alive?

10:35.400 --> 10:38.597
Your daughter is very worried about you.

10:38.640 --> 10:40.835
You might think she's all sweetness and light.

10:40.880 --> 10:43.917
Believe me,
Prunella just doesn't know how to enjoy life.

10:43.960 --> 10:47.794
You mean Patricia. Prunella was your wife.

10:48.640 --> 10:51.359
What? Oh, yes, yes. You know what I mean.

10:51.400 --> 10:52.992
I don't care what she said to you.

10:53.040 --> 10:55.713
I want you to re-draft my will,
leave Heather everything.

10:55.760 --> 10:58.911
<i>Except the house. Patricia can stay there.</i>

10:58.960 --> 11:00.473
Do you think that's wise?

11:00.520 --> 11:05.594
I mean, you've only just met,
and she is 40 years younger than you.

11:05.640 --> 11:07.232
38, actually.

11:07.280 --> 11:10.033
Look, I love her. She loves me.

11:10.080 --> 11:12.355
<i>You only have one heart in this life, Peter.</i>

11:12.400 --> 11:14.391
Oh, darling.

11:14.440 --> 11:17.398
This is my solicitor Peter Kingdom.

11:17.440 --> 11:19.476
He's been speaking with Patricia.

11:19.520 --> 11:20.873
Lovely.

11:20.920 --> 11:22.956
- Nice to meet you.
- And you too.

11:23.000 --> 11:25.275
Come on. I want to show you the ducklings.

11:25.320 --> 11:27.311
Oh, lovely.

11:27.360 --> 11:28.713
See you later.

11:37.920 --> 11:41.230
I'm trying to understand
the basis for your complaint.

11:41.280 --> 11:45.273
We live here. We shouldn't have naked people
strolling about willy-nilly.

11:45.320 --> 11:47.311
No. Right.

11:47.360 --> 11:49.749
So where exactly does this take place?

11:49.800 --> 11:52.360
Right in front of our eyes. Every day.

12:03.840 --> 12:05.831
You coming for a dip, Lyle?

12:09.400 --> 12:10.435
Nutters.

12:13.320 --> 12:16.676
What on earth do you think you're doing?

12:16.720 --> 12:19.757
Sorry. Can you excuse me for a minute?

12:19.800 --> 12:24.032
Honor doesn't want me anywhere near the baby.
I'm bored.

12:24.080 --> 12:26.071
Simon, I'm trying to protect you.

12:26.120 --> 12:29.237
Don't you understand that if you're seen,
the police will come here?

12:29.280 --> 12:31.874
So I'm not allowed near the phone now either?

12:31.920 --> 12:33.273
Mr Kingdom!

12:33.320 --> 12:35.675
Heather. Why don't you come into my office?

12:35.720 --> 12:36.869
Lyle!

12:36.920 --> 12:38.478
I don't need to go into your office.

12:38.520 --> 12:41.034
I just came to say thank you for this.

12:41.080 --> 12:43.719
But no, I won't be accepting
his daughter's money.

12:43.760 --> 12:46.433
Jim wouldn't want me to.
Why did you think I would?

12:46.480 --> 12:47.799
I didn't.

12:47.840 --> 12:49.558
I am <i>not</i> that kind of woman.

12:52.200 --> 12:53.394
Thank you.

12:54.760 --> 12:56.159
What to do, what do do?

12:56.200 --> 12:57.872
I can't make Jim change his mind.

12:57.920 --> 13:01.071
But how do I draft a will
that cuts out his own daughter?

13:01.120 --> 13:04.749
Simple. Jim's your client. You have no choice.

13:04.800 --> 13:08.475
If I've got to defend a bunch of naked people,
you can re-draft an old man's will.

13:08.520 --> 13:11.956
Yes, I wasn't actually asking you.
I was thinking aloud.

13:13.000 --> 13:15.150
Mind you, he did call Patricia Prunella.

13:15.200 --> 13:16.952
Maybe he's not of sound mind.

13:17.000 --> 13:20.151
He wants to spend his last few years
with a woman half his age.

13:20.200 --> 13:21.633
That sounds sane to me.

13:21.680 --> 13:24.752
What kind of daughter
would want to prevent her father's happiness?

13:24.800 --> 13:27.917
It's not as simple as that.
His estate is worth several million...

13:27.960 --> 13:29.359
MAN: <i>Mr Kingdom!</i>

13:29.400 --> 13:31.630
Ahoy, Mr Kingdom!

13:33.880 --> 13:35.871
Not now, Mr Snell, if you don't mind.

13:45.720 --> 13:48.712
If you're looking for the nappies,
they're on the bottom shelf.

13:48.760 --> 13:52.230
- What?
- You don't get it, do you?

13:52.720 --> 13:53.835
I'm trying.

13:54.720 --> 13:56.870
I don't even know who you are.

13:57.600 --> 13:59.955
All you ever did was lie, "Christopher".

14:00.000 --> 14:02.878
Well, I'm its father.

14:02.920 --> 14:04.558
<i>His father!</i>

14:04.600 --> 14:06.591
Well, yeah, biologically.

14:07.640 --> 14:10.518
Peter's been a better father to Daniel
than you'll ever be.

14:13.200 --> 14:15.953
<i>You've no idea how difficult it's been for me.</i>

14:16.000 --> 14:19.470
<i>How much hard work it is to be a mother,</i>
<i>let alone a single one.</i>

14:19.520 --> 14:21.397
SIMON: <i>I'm trying.</i>

14:21.440 --> 14:22.998
HONOR: <i>That'sjust my point.</i>

14:43.080 --> 14:44.195
Book 'em, Ronnie.

14:44.240 --> 14:46.231
Yes, sir.

14:46.280 --> 14:50.159
Whoa there. These are my clients.
What are you doing?

14:50.200 --> 14:54.034
Taking their numbers
so we can send them final warnings in the post.

14:54.080 --> 14:56.548
Not one of them yourself, are you?

14:56.600 --> 14:59.717
Oh, God, no.
You won't catch me stripping off in public.

15:01.840 --> 15:06.311
Although I would be
entirely within my rights to do so if I so wished.

15:06.360 --> 15:08.828
Not if you upset the people living in that house.

15:08.880 --> 15:12.236
They've been taking their clothes off here
for 20 years.

15:12.280 --> 15:16.717
Yeah, but the moment their nudity causes
distress in a public place, it's a criminal offence.

15:16.760 --> 15:18.796
What is so distressing about the human form?

15:18.840 --> 15:21.070
It's the most celebrated image in the art world.

15:21.120 --> 15:25.193
Maybe. But your friend over there
is rather more bottom than Botticelli.

15:33.400 --> 15:35.391
Have you got <i>her</i> number?

15:54.560 --> 15:56.676
Is there something I can help you with?

15:58.040 --> 15:59.758
Oh. Um...

15:59.800 --> 16:01.074
Well... Yeah.

16:01.120 --> 16:03.634
I was just sort of looking for some old files.

16:03.680 --> 16:06.274
Conveyancing stuff for my house.

16:06.320 --> 16:08.311
About '95, '96.

16:08.360 --> 16:10.351
I've moved them.

16:10.400 --> 16:12.197
They're on a shelf by my desk.

16:14.320 --> 16:16.231
I'm sorry, Patricia.

16:16.280 --> 16:18.350
Heather is quite set on him.

16:18.400 --> 16:20.391
And your father has decided,

16:20.440 --> 16:24.274
and as he seems to be in sound mind
and under no duress,

16:24.320 --> 16:25.799
there's nothing I can do.

16:25.840 --> 16:28.035
I know I'm right about her. About this.

16:28.080 --> 16:30.833
You owe it to my father.

16:32.640 --> 16:34.198
St John's Hospice?

16:34.240 --> 16:36.196
Heather worked there for a while.

16:36.240 --> 16:38.549
According to the woman who runs the place,

16:38.600 --> 16:42.309
she was named in a patient's will
and left straight after he died.

16:42.360 --> 16:44.874
She said Heather was named in a will?

16:44.920 --> 16:47.798
You could ring her yourself
if you don't believe me.

16:49.480 --> 16:51.550
Oh, no. Now, come on!

16:55.000 --> 16:58.436
What do you think you're doing?
The grass is wet.

17:00.200 --> 17:03.237
On the contrary. The grass is medicinal.

17:04.920 --> 17:08.469
You're worse than your mother was.
Do you know that?

17:26.040 --> 17:30.670
Thank you, yes. Do you have any record
of her being intimate with anyone else,

17:30.720 --> 17:32.597
other than this...

17:33.480 --> 17:34.595
I see.

17:34.640 --> 17:36.551
<i>Oh, my lord.</i>

17:40.160 --> 17:42.799
- DC Yelland's here.
- Oh, ruddy hell.

17:42.840 --> 17:44.319
- Come on, you.
- Don't pull me.

17:44.360 --> 17:46.237
If he sees you, we're ruined!

17:46.280 --> 17:50.193
Why? All I did was screw up my own suicide
and pretend to be someone else.

17:50.240 --> 17:53.516
- Are you saying you didn't fake it?
- Well, of course I didn't fake it.

17:53.560 --> 17:54.993
Peter!

17:55.040 --> 17:56.234
Ah, yes, yes!

17:56.280 --> 17:57.952
Get in there.

17:58.880 --> 18:00.632
(Laughs)

18:00.680 --> 18:01.396
<i>Peter?</i>

18:01.440 --> 18:04.238
GLORIA: <i>Come on!</i>
- Lyle, guard that door.

18:04.280 --> 18:05.918
Peter, the door's stuck!

18:05.960 --> 18:07.439
Ah!

18:07.480 --> 18:09.948
DC Yelland. How lovely to see you.

18:10.000 --> 18:14.312
Peter... I should warn you.
This is about your brother.

18:16.040 --> 18:18.600
Ah, well.
Perhaps we'd better discuss it in my office.

18:18.640 --> 18:20.232
No. This will only take a minute.

18:20.280 --> 18:22.271
- This is fun.
- Sh.

18:22.320 --> 18:24.151
Have you put on weight?

18:24.200 --> 18:25.189
Ha ha.

18:25.240 --> 18:28.789
This is serious.
This is us trying to save your arse.

18:28.840 --> 18:32.753
Peter, I don't want to give you false hope, but...

18:33.560 --> 18:37.269
the rumour is that Simon's
been seen around these parts.

18:38.320 --> 18:41.551
- These parts?
- Here. Market Shipborough.

18:41.600 --> 18:43.238
He's back?

18:43.280 --> 18:45.271
We used to play hide and seek in here.

18:45.320 --> 18:49.438
You did.
Mum wouldn't let me play in confined spaces.

18:49.480 --> 18:51.471
When exactly did you last hear from him?

18:53.160 --> 18:55.151
(Phone rings)

18:56.640 --> 18:57.629
Peter Kingdom.

18:57.680 --> 19:02.310
Yes. Oh, I'm sorry.
Brian, I'm going to have to take this.

19:02.360 --> 19:04.351
I hate the dark.

19:04.400 --> 19:05.753
Do you?

19:05.800 --> 19:07.791
I quite like it, myself.

19:10.240 --> 19:12.310
Did you really try and kill yourself?

19:14.360 --> 19:17.113
Oh, come on. It's my life.

19:17.160 --> 19:19.151
I'm entitled to my own mistakes.

19:19.200 --> 19:21.555
Yeah. And I was entitled to a phone call

19:21.600 --> 19:23.556
when you disappeared for a year and a half.

19:23.600 --> 19:24.874
I was worried sick about you.

19:24.920 --> 19:27.912
<i>Not for a moment did you think...</i>

19:27.960 --> 19:31.794
<i>"What's Beatrice going through?</i>
<i>What about her?"</i>

19:31.840 --> 19:35.150
Because maybe her life is bloody difficult
as well, Simon.

19:35.200 --> 19:37.077
PETER: <i>Now...</i>

19:48.400 --> 19:50.391
What's that?

19:50.440 --> 19:52.431
Um... It's er...

19:55.880 --> 19:58.269
It's just a little adventure.

20:01.480 --> 20:02.913
No.

20:02.960 --> 20:04.188
Not any more.

20:04.240 --> 20:07.277
No more games.
I'm not the same person, even if you are.

20:07.320 --> 20:09.311
He's in a lot of trouble, Peter.

20:09.360 --> 20:13.035
- You let me know the minute you see him.
- Of course. Of course.

20:17.080 --> 20:18.832
Ah, hello.

20:18.880 --> 20:20.950
What?

20:21.000 --> 20:22.399
This old thing?

20:22.440 --> 20:25.830
Yes, it's Stella McCartney.

20:27.120 --> 20:29.873
Arresting, isn't it?

20:29.920 --> 20:32.309
She has a thing about, um, cupboards.

20:32.360 --> 20:35.238
(Laughs) Anyway...

20:35.280 --> 20:36.554
See you later...

20:36.600 --> 20:38.591
PC Yelland. Bye.

20:51.920 --> 20:53.035
(Knocking)

20:53.080 --> 20:56.755
SIMON: <i>Beatrice. Can I come out now?</i>

21:02.640 --> 21:04.153
Argh!

21:06.640 --> 21:09.313
I got a call from an ex-colleague
at St John's Hospice.

21:09.360 --> 21:11.749
You've been checking up on me, haven't you?

21:11.800 --> 21:15.588
I have a duty to protect the interests
of my clients.

21:15.640 --> 21:17.631
He doesn't want protecting.

21:18.560 --> 21:21.472
Yes, there was someone at St John's.

21:21.520 --> 21:23.556
Yes, they did leave me money when they died.

21:23.600 --> 21:26.034
So why did you resign, then?

21:26.080 --> 21:29.595
People were talking about me behind my back.
I had to leave.

21:31.400 --> 21:34.437
Look, I don't care about his money. All right?

21:34.480 --> 21:37.392
<i>Things have changed, Mr Kingdom.</i>

21:37.440 --> 21:39.431
Jim has changed me.

21:40.520 --> 21:42.795
And anyway, we're past all that.

21:42.840 --> 21:44.876
We're getting married.

21:44.920 --> 21:46.911
Peter, Heather, come quickly.

21:46.960 --> 21:50.191
It's Jim. He's had a heart attack.

21:52.840 --> 21:55.035
He's stable now.

21:59.800 --> 22:00.949
He is stable, but...

22:01.000 --> 22:03.355
the second heart attack so soon after the last...

22:03.400 --> 22:06.836
One way or another, we need to sort this out.

22:16.000 --> 22:17.513
MAN: <i>Say that again.</i>

22:17.560 --> 22:19.152
Look, I've got it. It's simple.

22:19.200 --> 22:22.954
We split the car park in two
and build a big screen down the middle.

22:23.000 --> 22:26.310
We get the nudists to park on one side
of the screen...

22:26.360 --> 22:27.918
(Hangs up)

22:27.960 --> 22:29.951
Hello?

22:35.560 --> 22:38.358
Hello, Sandy. How are you?

22:39.040 --> 22:41.031
Poor old Jim.

22:41.080 --> 22:43.674
I found him in his room just after Heather left.

22:43.720 --> 22:45.711
She'd been with him?

22:45.760 --> 22:47.716
Yes. Why?

22:47.760 --> 22:50.558
Do you think the exertion
might have tipped him over the edge?

22:50.600 --> 22:53.637
Aunt Auriel, I refuse to let you
bring sex into this conversation.

22:53.680 --> 22:56.399
Who said anything about sex?

22:57.080 --> 22:58.991
She was helping him with his physio.

23:00.560 --> 23:02.471
- Is he all right?
- Can I have a word?

23:04.280 --> 23:06.475
Oh, for God's sake...

23:06.520 --> 23:09.318
If you can't be pleasant, don't bother coming in.

23:09.360 --> 23:11.954
I don't want any more lectures.

23:12.000 --> 23:13.991
I'm not a child.

23:15.600 --> 23:16.828
No, but I am your child.

23:16.880 --> 23:19.997
If she is more important to you,

23:20.040 --> 23:22.713
then I'll just go, then.

23:22.760 --> 23:24.751
Shall I?

23:26.600 --> 23:27.589
Oh...

23:27.640 --> 23:30.632
That's perfectly clear, isn't it?

23:31.800 --> 23:33.358
- Oh, wait, Patricia.
- Let me go.

23:33.400 --> 23:36.358
He didn't mean it. You're the only family he's got.

23:36.400 --> 23:38.391
Not for much longer.

23:43.480 --> 23:45.789
So, why won't Peter see me?

23:45.840 --> 23:48.593
He's trying out a new policy. Appointments only.

23:48.640 --> 23:49.629
Oh.

23:49.680 --> 23:51.193
When can I come in?

23:53.040 --> 23:54.917
I might have to get back to you on that one.

24:01.400 --> 24:04.631
You don't think Heather
was trying to give Mr Wright a heart attack?

24:06.680 --> 24:08.671
Lyle, please.

24:09.880 --> 24:12.633
She does stand to inherit
a lot of money if he croaks.

24:12.680 --> 24:15.956
When he marries her,
his previous wills become invalid.

24:16.000 --> 24:17.479
I think she planned it all along.

24:17.520 --> 24:18.669
You've only got her word

24:18.720 --> 24:20.278
about what happened at St John's.

24:20.320 --> 24:24.996
Yes. Well, perhaps if we stopped
leaping to outrageous conclusions,

24:25.040 --> 24:27.998
we might actually uncover the facts of the case.

24:28.040 --> 24:30.838
Get St John's on the phone for me anyway,
would you?

24:42.880 --> 24:43.915
No!

24:45.320 --> 24:46.275
Oh.

24:51.920 --> 24:54.309
Shoo! Shoo!

24:57.720 --> 24:58.675
Shoo!

24:59.640 --> 25:00.629
Argh!

25:00.680 --> 25:02.671
(Splash)

25:25.160 --> 25:27.879
All I can say is,
she wasn't at St John's for very long.

25:27.920 --> 25:29.751
And why did she leave?

25:29.800 --> 25:33.873
I can't give out personal information
without Heather's permission.

25:33.920 --> 25:36.718
Was she particularly close
to any of the patients?

25:36.760 --> 25:38.796
Mr Kingdom, it's confidential.

25:38.840 --> 25:40.831
I won't say anything more about it.

25:40.880 --> 25:42.871
If you'll excuse me...

25:48.800 --> 25:51.997
I told you. She's a gold digger.
You have to tell Mr Wright.

25:52.040 --> 25:53.632
We don't deal in supposition, Lyle.

25:53.680 --> 25:55.033
Well, you know what they say.

25:55.080 --> 25:58.516
If it looks like a shark and walks like a shark,
it probably is a shark.

25:58.560 --> 26:00.551
Yes, well, it isn't a shark.

26:00.600 --> 26:03.068
And anyway, who have you ever heard say that?

26:03.120 --> 26:05.839
No. Second thoughts, don't want to know.
Life's too short.

26:05.880 --> 26:07.438
(Phone rings)

26:07.480 --> 26:09.948
Lyle Anderson.

26:10.000 --> 26:11.991
Yes, Ted.

26:12.040 --> 26:14.759
There's a club meeting at the pub. 6:30.

26:14.800 --> 26:16.791
We want a progress report.

26:16.840 --> 26:18.831
Don't let us down, Lyle.

26:22.080 --> 26:24.196
It's your pipes, Ted. They're blocked.

26:27.080 --> 26:29.071
Naturist problems?

26:29.120 --> 26:33.511
What's the point? Council aren't going to back
a bunch of weirdos, are they?

26:33.560 --> 26:35.710
That bunch of weirdos are your clients, Lyle.

26:35.760 --> 26:38.832
- You've got to be prepared to fight for them.
- I'll be a laughing stock.

26:38.880 --> 26:42.919
Well, maybe so, but no-one
is going to respect you if you quit. Are they?

26:48.680 --> 26:50.033
(Knocking)

26:50.080 --> 26:51.877
I'll put you down for that appointment.

26:51.920 --> 26:54.195
(Knocking continues)

26:54.240 --> 26:57.755
SIMON: <i>Beatrice! Is that you? Beatrice?</i>

27:00.200 --> 27:02.191
<i>Hurry up!</i>

27:05.280 --> 27:07.271
Didn't you have a key?

27:07.320 --> 27:10.232
Is that the new look? What happened to you?

27:10.280 --> 27:12.077
I fell.

27:12.120 --> 27:13.553
She did a very silly thing.

27:13.600 --> 27:16.160
No. I was trying to save them.

27:16.200 --> 27:19.192
Seagulls are not
supposed to take antidepressants.

28:17.520 --> 28:19.476
We need to clear the air about Simon.

28:19.520 --> 28:21.511
No, Honor. It's fine.

28:21.560 --> 28:23.516
The father of your child's back.

28:23.560 --> 28:25.551
I know where I stand.

28:25.600 --> 28:27.591
No, Lyle. I don't think you do.

28:29.440 --> 28:31.431
Evening, Lyle.

28:35.840 --> 28:37.068
Important meeting.

28:37.120 --> 28:39.839
I've got to go.

28:39.880 --> 28:41.472
Sandy! Sandy!

28:46.800 --> 28:48.791
Beatrice. Are you all right?

28:52.360 --> 28:54.351
What's the matter?

28:54.400 --> 28:56.277
Is it Simon?

28:57.880 --> 28:59.359
No, it is not bloody Simon.

28:59.400 --> 29:02.870
Simon's fine. Simon has gone for a walk.

29:02.920 --> 29:06.595
What? He's left the building?

29:06.640 --> 29:08.039
Said he was going to the beach.

29:10.840 --> 29:12.273
Can this wait?

29:12.320 --> 29:14.311
Oh, yes. Don't mind me.

29:14.360 --> 29:16.590
I'm only your bloody sister.

29:37.640 --> 29:39.392
Too right it can wait.

29:39.440 --> 29:41.431
You're so bloody naive.

29:48.280 --> 29:50.271
I know what it's like.

29:50.320 --> 29:52.311
You're pregnant, aren't you?

30:13.560 --> 30:14.879
Don't have a go at me.

30:14.920 --> 30:16.273
I needed some air.

30:16.320 --> 30:18.276
Well, fine. Cards on the table, then.

30:19.360 --> 30:20.475
What happened?

30:22.840 --> 30:24.876
I did walk out into the sea.

30:24.920 --> 30:27.912
You know how they say
that fishermen don't learn to swim?

30:27.960 --> 30:31.077
Apparently the more you struggle,
the longer it takes for you to die.

30:31.120 --> 30:33.190
You're just better off accepting it.

30:34.240 --> 30:35.673
But you couldn't accept it?

30:35.720 --> 30:37.711
No.

30:37.760 --> 30:39.239
I was out there for about...

30:39.280 --> 30:40.713
six hours.

30:40.760 --> 30:42.512
Then I came to,

30:42.560 --> 30:44.551
and I was still breathing,

30:46.160 --> 30:47.991
and I realised that I had a second chance.

30:48.040 --> 30:50.031
But I still had to run away...

30:50.080 --> 30:53.914
from my debts, from... the world,

30:53.960 --> 30:55.359
from you.

30:55.400 --> 30:57.391
From myself.

30:57.440 --> 30:59.431
But Simon...

30:59.480 --> 31:01.072
You planned this.

31:01.120 --> 31:02.678
You...

31:02.720 --> 31:04.312
You stole someone's identity.

31:04.360 --> 31:06.157
It's a bloody mess.

31:06.200 --> 31:08.191
So why did you come home now?

31:08.240 --> 31:11.357
It's not easy pretending to be
someone else all the time.

31:11.400 --> 31:14.233
You start to forget who you really are.

31:15.400 --> 31:17.391
I haven't treated you right.

31:18.440 --> 31:20.431
I know that.

31:20.480 --> 31:22.471
That's important, isn't it?

31:25.360 --> 31:26.759
So that's why I've come back.

31:30.040 --> 31:32.076
What are we going to tell the police?

31:36.520 --> 31:38.511
Don't know.

31:45.500 --> 31:46.819
I spoke to the council again,

31:46.860 --> 31:49.772
and I'm afraid they're sticking to their guns.

31:49.820 --> 31:51.048
You're not trying.

31:51.100 --> 31:53.409
I am. They've just refused all my suggestions.

31:53.460 --> 31:54.575
(Groans)

31:54.620 --> 31:55.894
It's not looking good.

31:55.940 --> 31:58.454
You're one of them.

31:58.500 --> 32:00.491
(Murmurs of agreement)

32:05.500 --> 32:06.819
You have one minute.

32:06.860 --> 32:08.054
Right.

32:08.100 --> 32:09.897
Ah...

32:10.700 --> 32:12.418
Don't worry. I'm not dead yet.

32:12.460 --> 32:14.416
I...

32:14.460 --> 32:16.291
I'm sorry about earlier.

32:16.340 --> 32:17.932
That business with Patricia.

32:17.980 --> 32:22.053
Ever since her mother died,
she's been trying to run my life.

32:22.100 --> 32:23.579
Well, anyway, Jim,

32:23.620 --> 32:25.576
much against my better judgement,

32:25.620 --> 32:26.973
I have drafted the will

32:27.020 --> 32:29.011
as you requested.

32:29.060 --> 32:32.211
Everything except the house goes to Heather.

32:32.260 --> 32:33.613
Good man.

32:33.660 --> 32:36.891
We'll need two witnesses.

32:36.940 --> 32:38.453
<i>I'll ask the nurses.</i>

32:38.500 --> 32:40.855
Before that, there's something I have to tell you.

32:40.900 --> 32:44.449
Certain information has come to light
about Heather.

32:44.500 --> 32:46.616
It seems that on at least one occasion,

32:46.660 --> 32:49.049
she's made money out of a patient's death.

32:50.980 --> 32:53.289
I know everything I need to know about Heather.

32:55.140 --> 32:58.894
She's had to deal with every kind of crap
that life has thrown at her.

32:58.940 --> 33:00.931
<i>You can't imagine.</i>

33:00.980 --> 33:04.734
<i>When we met here in the cardiac clinic,</i>

33:04.780 --> 33:06.771
we just hit it off.

33:06.820 --> 33:08.811
I want her to be my wife.

33:10.100 --> 33:12.978
All this bother is because...
she's young and I'm old.

33:13.020 --> 33:15.170
But what about Patricia?

33:15.220 --> 33:18.496
She has the house. She'll be all right.

33:18.540 --> 33:20.531
(Coughs)

33:21.220 --> 33:24.337
I want... I want Heather to have my money.

33:25.900 --> 33:27.652
She's doing the same for me.

33:27.700 --> 33:30.772
It's what we've agreed.
We're leaving everything to each other.

33:30.820 --> 33:33.971
(Knock at door)
- Ah...

33:34.020 --> 33:36.250
I know you're doing your best, Peter.

33:36.300 --> 33:39.372
But you just ask the doctors here,
and they'll tell you.

33:39.420 --> 33:41.570
You can't help everyone.

33:41.620 --> 33:44.976
Right. There you are.

33:50.700 --> 33:54.249
(Chanting) Off! Off!

33:54.300 --> 33:56.291
(Chanting continues)

33:59.020 --> 34:01.011
(Cheering)

34:04.660 --> 34:06.616
Yay!

34:07.300 --> 34:10.975
Comrades. We shall prevail.

34:17.860 --> 34:21.455
Morning, Lyle. Your new client rang
to say she's going to be a bit late.

34:21.500 --> 34:22.774
Well, at least I'm on time.

34:24.100 --> 34:26.170
Thanks, mate. That's the case for my defence.

34:26.219 --> 34:28.335
Evidence. Do you know what that means?

34:28.380 --> 34:30.848
About three to five years probably.

34:31.540 --> 34:35.897
You and I need to sit down together,
decide what we're going to tell DC Yelland.

34:35.940 --> 34:36.929
Peter!

34:36.980 --> 34:39.335
Can you get
Patricia Wright on the phone for me?

34:39.380 --> 34:43.498
I'm trying to tell you something important.
Beatrice asked me to give you this.

34:46.260 --> 34:48.251
What am I looking at?

34:48.300 --> 34:50.291
Simon, for God's sake.

34:50.340 --> 34:52.331
Beatrice is pregnant.

34:58.580 --> 35:00.571
(Knock at door)

35:06.380 --> 35:07.495
Oh, God.

35:07.540 --> 35:09.531
I'm not meant to be here.

35:09.580 --> 35:11.616
I wanted to catch the earlier train.

35:11.660 --> 35:14.618
I don't see why you have to go at all.

35:14.660 --> 35:17.936
Surely now is exactly when you need us most.

35:22.420 --> 35:24.456
Will you give me a lift to the station?

35:26.380 --> 35:30.168
If I am to do this properly,
I'm going to have to come off my medication.

35:30.220 --> 35:34.259
And to do that, I'm going to need
much more support than you're able to give.

35:36.140 --> 35:40.292
It's going to be really hard for me, Peter,
but it's the best thing for the baby.

35:42.380 --> 35:45.292
Anyway, you really don't need another addict
in the family.

35:45.340 --> 35:47.649
Or another baby, for that matter.

35:47.700 --> 35:49.691
Simon's back now.

35:49.740 --> 35:53.494
Exactly. With Simon there's always
a whole load of shit to deal with.

35:53.540 --> 35:56.179
Anyway, you've got Danny and Honor
to think of now.

35:57.900 --> 36:01.529
So, just as one troublesome sibling
returns from the dead,

36:01.580 --> 36:03.730
the one I'm really going to miss is running away.

36:03.780 --> 36:05.293
I'm not running away.

36:05.340 --> 36:08.616
I'm really not.
This is the first grown-up decision of my life.

36:08.660 --> 36:09.979
I'm going because I have to.

36:20.060 --> 36:21.334
Oh, are you taking Milly?

36:21.380 --> 36:23.814
She is mine, Peter.

36:25.740 --> 36:27.014
I'll miss you both.

36:27.060 --> 36:30.769
You've got the number of the clinic.
You can always call.

36:41.940 --> 36:43.214
Look out for Simon.

36:50.540 --> 36:52.531
Right. So we're all agreed.

36:52.580 --> 36:53.979
You can go nude on the beach,

36:54.020 --> 36:56.090
but no taking your togs off in the car park.

36:56.140 --> 36:57.539
We've got to park somewhere.

36:57.580 --> 36:59.218
You don't have to do it naked.

36:59.260 --> 37:01.854
<i>Just keep your togs on</i>
<i>until you reach the beach itself.</i>

37:01.900 --> 37:03.936
They're taking the mickey with those aprons.

37:03.980 --> 37:05.857
No, they're just trying to make a point.

37:05.900 --> 37:07.379
Which is?

37:10.580 --> 37:12.536
The human body isn't offensive.

37:12.580 --> 37:14.571
Right.

37:14.620 --> 37:17.214
It's just a bit wrinkly sometimes.

37:17.260 --> 37:19.012
It's disgusting, is what it is.

37:19.060 --> 37:21.210
Have three kids
and see what it does to your hips.

37:21.260 --> 37:23.820
I don't want to know.

37:23.860 --> 37:26.579
Look,
I don't want to see any of them naked either.

37:26.620 --> 37:29.930
<i>Well, not all of them, anyway.</i>

37:29.980 --> 37:32.255
You're filthy, disgusting perverts.

37:32.300 --> 37:34.291
Let me finish, Maureen.

37:34.340 --> 37:36.615
And I won't have any of you stripping off.

37:36.660 --> 37:39.572
Not on my doorstep. Not in my house.
Not on your life.

37:39.620 --> 37:42.180
Not now, not ever.

37:42.220 --> 37:44.290
I will not have nakedness of any kind.

37:46.580 --> 37:47.808
What the hell are you doing?

37:47.860 --> 37:50.579
I'm stripping off, Mervin.

37:57.620 --> 37:59.099
You are coming with me.

38:02.460 --> 38:03.893
Right.

38:05.940 --> 38:08.818
Mr Kingdom.

38:08.860 --> 38:11.932
Mr Snell.
I really don't have time for this right now.

38:11.980 --> 38:15.097
- Do you mind making an appointment?
- I have, and it's now.

38:15.140 --> 38:16.653
Here's the fee I owe on my account.

38:16.700 --> 38:18.895
I know you're only trying to put me off paying,

38:18.940 --> 38:20.168
but you know me, Mr Kingdom.

38:20.220 --> 38:22.051
I like to do what's right.

38:22.100 --> 38:24.091
I bid you good day.

38:28.140 --> 38:29.732
SIMON: Where are we going?

38:29.780 --> 38:32.089
PETER: I'm taking you to see Auriel.

38:41.820 --> 38:43.936
<i>Don't worry. I'm not stealing.</i>

38:43.980 --> 38:46.414
He's asked me to get some of his things.

38:46.460 --> 38:48.496
Actually, I need your help.

38:48.540 --> 38:49.734
My help?

38:49.780 --> 38:50.974
<i>Mm.</i>

38:51.020 --> 38:53.375
I need you to offer an olive branch to Patricia.

38:55.700 --> 38:58.294
Aunt Auriel.

39:01.260 --> 39:02.978
You're looking divine as ever.

39:04.020 --> 39:06.329
You haven't told the police you're back,
have you?

39:06.380 --> 39:09.850
Well, the paparazzi, Auriel.

39:09.900 --> 39:12.289
They follow me everywhere.
You know what it's like.

39:12.340 --> 39:16.413
Um... May I have a hug, please?

39:17.900 --> 39:19.299
Come here.

39:23.340 --> 39:26.093
I knew you'd surface eventually.

39:29.140 --> 39:31.131
- Bye.
- Bye-bye.

39:46.020 --> 39:47.817
You still need to go and see the police.

39:47.860 --> 39:50.579
- This problem isn't just going to go away.
- I'm not going.

39:50.620 --> 39:52.611
You agreed.

39:52.660 --> 39:55.220
I'm not going to see the police,
so we'll just drop it, OK?

39:55.260 --> 39:57.296
If you want to stay in Market Shipborough...

39:57.340 --> 39:59.615
If you want to stay in England for that...

40:00.700 --> 40:02.019
You're not staying.

40:02.060 --> 40:04.415
I can't risk going to jail, all right?

40:04.460 --> 40:06.178
Er, Patricia.

40:06.220 --> 40:08.609
Um, will you come with me to see your father?

40:10.020 --> 40:12.329
Not if that money-grabbing tramp is with him.

40:13.820 --> 40:16.288
You might as well know
that I have amended his will

40:16.340 --> 40:18.808
in accordance with his instructions.

40:18.860 --> 40:21.249
Peter, how could you?

40:21.300 --> 40:25.293
Please, we're past that now.
You all have to talk before it's too late.

40:30.340 --> 40:31.489
That went well, then?

40:31.540 --> 40:33.531
Don't you talk to me.

40:33.580 --> 40:36.140
I wash my hands of you.

40:46.660 --> 40:49.413
I want you to pack your bags and go.

40:49.460 --> 40:51.974
No problem, Peter. Whatever you want.

40:54.100 --> 40:55.135
So.

40:55.180 --> 40:57.330
What does Honor think of your new friendship?

40:58.380 --> 41:00.974
Honor? What?

41:01.060 --> 41:03.051
What do you care?

41:04.500 --> 41:06.411
Sandy doesn't date part-time nudists.

41:06.460 --> 41:09.816
Says she can't go out with someone
who is uncomfortable in their own skin.

41:09.860 --> 41:13.136
Sadly for her, that rules out
more than half the human race.

41:13.180 --> 41:16.570
Tell me, how are things going
with our bare-bottomed friends?

41:16.620 --> 41:18.611
A few wrinkles to iron out.

41:18.660 --> 41:20.139
Cracks to paper over.

41:20.180 --> 41:22.171
Hop in.

41:46.220 --> 41:48.256
Oh. She's not here.

41:48.300 --> 41:50.291
Go and find her.

41:53.060 --> 41:54.254
Mr Wright?

41:58.300 --> 42:00.291
Jim.

42:05.340 --> 42:06.659
Is Patricia with you?

42:06.700 --> 42:08.691
I'm afraid not.

42:09.580 --> 42:11.571
Hi. I'm looking for Room 8.

42:11.620 --> 42:13.611
Just on your left-hand side. OK?

42:23.820 --> 42:26.095
PETER:
<i>Maybe if you were to make the first move...</i>

42:26.140 --> 42:28.290
<i>It's never too late to build bridges.</i>

42:29.580 --> 42:30.979
You never know.

42:31.020 --> 42:34.171
You might get Patricia and Heather to talk.

42:34.220 --> 42:36.211
<i>I'd be more than happy to mediate.</i>

42:36.260 --> 42:38.251
They can't.

42:38.300 --> 42:42.054
Of course they can.
All it takes is a bit of good will on both sides.

42:42.100 --> 42:43.897
No. Peter. They can't.

42:45.740 --> 42:46.934
Heather's dead.

42:47.980 --> 42:50.699
<i>That's why I made the will.</i>

42:50.740 --> 42:52.731
And now I've lost them both.

43:01.740 --> 43:04.891
She never worked here.
She was a patient, not a nurse.

43:04.940 --> 43:07.738
She had a congenital heart defect
which was worse than his.

43:07.780 --> 43:09.771
That's how they met.

43:14.660 --> 43:15.888
I just heard.

43:15.940 --> 43:18.454
How is he?

43:18.500 --> 43:19.774
In shock.

43:19.820 --> 43:21.811
Not good.

43:21.860 --> 43:25.569
I said such awful things about her. To him.

43:25.620 --> 43:27.611
They made mutual wills.

43:27.660 --> 43:31.016
She left everything to him.

43:31.060 --> 43:33.051
So eventually, at some point,

43:33.100 --> 43:36.217
all his money and hers will come to you.

44:03.140 --> 44:04.732
I'm so sorry.

44:14.620 --> 44:16.611
I know.

44:36.860 --> 44:38.851
Forgive me.

45:11.860 --> 45:13.452
Right, then.

45:14.860 --> 45:16.339
Right, then.

45:21.700 --> 45:23.691
Simon Kingdom.

45:23.740 --> 45:25.173
You're under arrest?????«??????????????????????????????????????????
