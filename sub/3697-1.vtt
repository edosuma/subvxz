Dear friend...

02:00.204 --> 02:04.457
I am writing to you
because she said you listen and understand.

02:04.541 --> 02:06.626
And didn't try to sleep
with that person at that party...

02:06.710 --> 02:08.419
even though you could have.

02:09.545 --> 02:12.089
Please, don't try to figure out who I am.

02:12.174 --> 02:14.258
I don't want you to do that.

02:14.343 --> 02:17.303
I just need to know that
people like you exist.

02:17.387 --> 02:19.680
Like, if you met me you wouldn't...

02:19.765 --> 02:23.768
think I was the weird kid
who spent time in the hospital.

02:26.522 --> 02:28.523
And I wouldn't make you nervous.

02:30.067 --> 02:33.319
I hope it's okay for me to think that.

02:33.403 --> 02:35.696
You see, I haven't really
talked to anyone...

02:35.781 --> 02:37.907
outside of my family all summer.

02:37.991 --> 02:41.285
But tomorrow is my first day
of high school ever.

02:41.370 --> 02:44.205
And I need to turn things around.

02:44.289 --> 02:46.958
So I have a plan.

02:47.042 --> 02:48.835
As I enter the school for the first time...

02:48.919 --> 02:50.670
I will visualize what it will be like...

02:50.754 --> 02:53.714
on the last day of my senior year.

02:53.799 --> 02:56.175
Unfortunately, I counted and that's...

02:57.427 --> 02:59.554
Hop, freshman toads! Hop! Let's move it!

02:59.638 --> 03:03.182
1,385 days from now.

03:03.267 --> 03:05.476
We worked out all summer. Rock hard.

03:05.561 --> 03:07.645
Hey, you know what?
Why don't you guys get a room?

03:07.729 --> 03:12.316
Just 1,385 days.

03:12.401 --> 03:16.237
In the meantime, I'd hoped that my sister,
Candace, and her boyfriend, Derek...

03:16.321 --> 03:18.322
would have let me eat lunch
with their Earth Club.

03:18.407 --> 03:19.740
Seniors only.

03:21.451 --> 03:23.202
What are you doing with that plastic spork?

03:23.287 --> 03:25.413
I don't wanna bring back silverware.

03:25.497 --> 03:29.876
Derek, you're Earth Club treasurer.
Come on!

03:29.960 --> 03:32.378
When my sister said "No," I thought...

03:32.462 --> 03:36.424
maybe my old friend Susan
would wanna have lunch with me.

03:36.508 --> 03:40.511
In middle school,
Susan was very fun to be around...

03:40.596 --> 03:43.598
but now she doesn't
like to say "Hi" to me anymore.

03:43.682 --> 03:45.182
And then there's Brad Hays.

03:45.267 --> 03:48.269
Before my older brother
went to play football for Penn State...

03:48.353 --> 03:49.979
he and Brad played together...

03:50.063 --> 03:52.648
so I thought maybe he'd say "Hi" to me.

03:52.733 --> 03:54.400
But Brad's a senior.

03:54.484 --> 03:57.236
And I'm me. So who am I kidding?

03:57.321 --> 03:59.447
On the bright side...

03:59.531 --> 04:02.909
one senior decided to make fun of the
teacher instead of the freshmen.

04:02.993 --> 04:05.953
He even drew on Mr. Callahan's
legendary goatee...

04:06.038 --> 04:07.413
with a grease pencil.

04:10.292 --> 04:12.919
The prick punch is not a toy.

04:13.003 --> 04:15.880
I learned that back in 'Nam in '68.

04:15.964 --> 04:17.757
"Callahan," sergeant said...

04:17.841 --> 04:18.882
"you put down that prick punch.

04:18.966 --> 04:20.927
You go kill some gooks."

04:21.011 --> 04:22.803
And you know what happened?

04:22.888 --> 04:26.432
That prick punch killed my best friend
in a Saigon whorehouse.

04:26.516 --> 04:29.810
I heard you were gonna be in my class.

04:29.895 --> 04:31.187
Are you proud to be a senior...

04:31.271 --> 04:34.315
having to take freshman shop, Patty-Cakes?

04:34.399 --> 04:36.108
Look, my name is Patrick.

04:36.193 --> 04:38.361
Either you call me Patrick
or you call me nothing.

04:38.445 --> 04:40.446
Okay, Nothing.

04:42.407 --> 04:44.367
I felt really bad for Patrick.

04:44.451 --> 04:48.245
He wasn't doing the impersonation
to be mean or anything.

04:48.330 --> 04:51.207
He was just trying
to make us freshmen feel better.

04:51.291 --> 04:54.126
Nothing, why don't you read first?

04:54.211 --> 04:56.837
All right. "Chapter One.

04:56.922 --> 04:58.923
Surviving your fascist shop teacher...

04:59.007 --> 05:00.716
who needs to put kids down to feel big."

05:00.801 --> 05:03.094
Wow,
this is useful, guys. We should read on.

05:04.388 --> 05:07.473
My last class of the day
is Advanced English...

05:07.557 --> 05:09.350
and I'm really excited to finally learn...

05:09.434 --> 05:12.061
with the smartest kids in the school.

05:12.145 --> 05:15.147
Nice Trapper Keeper, faggot.

05:15.232 --> 05:18.567
Believe it or not, she's gotten
straight A's since kindergarten.

05:19.569 --> 05:21.904
Shh!

05:21.989 --> 05:23.447
I'm Mr. Anderson.

05:23.532 --> 05:25.700
I'm gonna be your teacher
for freshman English.

05:25.784 --> 05:27.118
This semester we're gonna learn about...

05:27.202 --> 05:29.120
Harper Lee's To Kill a Mockingbird.

05:29.204 --> 05:30.621
Genius book.

05:30.706 --> 05:32.790
Now, who'd like to get out
of the first pop quiz?

05:34.793 --> 05:37.670
I'm shocked. All right.
Well, you can skip the quiz...

05:37.754 --> 05:40.131
if you tell me which author
invented the paperback book.

05:41.008 --> 05:42.508
Anyone?

05:42.592 --> 05:44.260
He was British.

05:44.344 --> 05:46.220
He also invented the serial.

05:46.304 --> 05:50.725
In fact, at the end of
the third chapter of his first novel...

05:50.809 --> 05:54.979
he had a man hanging from
a cliff by his fingernails.

05:55.063 --> 05:56.731
Hence the term "cliff hanger."

05:57.566 --> 05:59.358
Anybody?

05:59.443 --> 06:01.402
- Yeah?
- Shakespeare.

06:01.486 --> 06:03.154
That's a great guess, but no.

06:03.238 --> 06:04.947
Shakespeare didn't write novels.

06:05.657 --> 06:07.450
Anybody else?

06:09.369 --> 06:11.245
The author...

06:14.082 --> 06:17.460
was Charles Dickens.

06:17.544 --> 06:19.754
However, if you and I had
gone to a Shakespeare play...

06:19.838 --> 06:21.672
it would have cost us four pennies.

06:21.757 --> 06:22.882
Can you imagine that?

06:22.966 --> 06:25.551
We would have put those
pennies in a metal box.

06:25.635 --> 06:27.553
The ushers would lock it in the office.

06:27.637 --> 06:29.221
And that's where we get the term...

06:29.306 --> 06:30.723
Cash register.

06:32.434 --> 06:33.392
Office Max.

06:33.477 --> 06:35.061
I'll give you a free "A" on anything...

06:35.145 --> 06:37.188
except the final term
paper if you get it right.

06:41.318 --> 06:42.651
Box office.

06:45.363 --> 06:47.156
You should learn to participate.

06:50.202 --> 06:51.702
Why didn't you raise your hand?

06:54.748 --> 06:56.957
They call you the "teacher's pet"?

06:57.042 --> 06:58.334
"Freak"? That kinda thing?

06:59.169 --> 07:01.045
I used to get "spaz."

07:01.129 --> 07:02.505
I mean, come on, "spaz"?

07:06.927 --> 07:09.386
You know, I heard
you had a tough time last year.

07:09.471 --> 07:12.348
But they say if you make one friend...

07:12.432 --> 07:14.558
on your first day, you're doing okay.

07:14.643 --> 07:16.519
Thank you, sir, but if my English teacher...

07:16.603 --> 07:18.270
is the only friend I make today...

07:18.355 --> 07:20.439
that would be sort of depressing.

07:20.524 --> 07:22.817
Yeah, I can see that.

07:22.901 --> 07:25.444
Don't worry, Mr. Anderson, I'm okay.

07:25.529 --> 07:26.529
Thanks.

07:32.577 --> 07:35.412
I would happily not take shop...

07:36.164 --> 07:37.540
Hey, freshman toad.

07:38.959 --> 07:43.838
Well, I have 1,384 days to go.

07:44.965 --> 07:47.258
Just so I say it to someone...

07:47.342 --> 07:50.177
high school is even worse
than middle school.

07:51.972 --> 07:53.806
If my parents ask me about it...

07:53.890 --> 07:56.142
I probably won't tell them the truth...

07:56.226 --> 07:57.518
because I don't want them...

07:57.602 --> 08:00.563
to worry that I might get bad again.

08:00.647 --> 08:03.482
If my Aunt Helen were still here,
I could talk to her...

08:03.567 --> 08:05.151
and I know she would understand...

08:05.235 --> 08:07.653
how I'm both happy and sad.

08:07.737 --> 08:11.031
And I'm still trying
to figure out how that could be.

08:11.116 --> 08:13.951
I just hope I make a friend soon.

08:14.035 --> 08:16.704
Love always, Charlie.

08:17.747 --> 08:19.540
Charlie? Come on.

08:21.459 --> 08:23.794
This chicken paprikash is delicious.

08:23.879 --> 08:25.838
Thank you, Derek. It's Charlie's favorite.

08:25.922 --> 08:29.675
He was a little nervous about starting high
school today, so I made it for him.

08:29.759 --> 08:31.759
Feel a little silly
about being nervous now, Champ?

08:32.636 --> 08:34.722
Yes, sir. I sure do.

08:34.806 --> 08:37.015
I told you, just give 'em a smile...

08:37.100 --> 08:38.517
and be yourself.

08:38.602 --> 08:40.727
- That's how you—
- Make friends in the real world.

08:40.812 --> 08:42.354
You're cruisin' for a bruisin'.

08:42.438 --> 08:45.274
Freshman year is tough, but...

08:45.358 --> 08:47.234
you really find yourself.

08:52.032 --> 08:54.200
Thanks, Derek.

08:54.284 --> 08:56.202
You could have been a
little nicer to Derek.

08:56.286 --> 09:00.122
I'm sorry, the kid's a pussy.
I can't stand him.

09:00.207 --> 09:02.374
- I really hope you love the mix tape I made.
- I do.

09:02.459 --> 09:05.461
- The cover is hand-painted.
- Wow.

09:10.133 --> 09:11.759
Hey, Charlie, you want this?

09:12.761 --> 09:14.303
Are you sure?

09:14.387 --> 09:16.347
He gives me one every week.

09:20.018 --> 09:21.477
Hey, babe.

09:21.561 --> 09:26.023
This next one might be a little sad,
but it reminded me of your eyes.

11:07.667 --> 11:09.460
- Hey, Nothing.
- Hey, Nothing.

11:09.544 --> 11:11.003
Suck it, virginity pledges.

11:12.047 --> 11:13.964
Suck it.

11:14.049 --> 11:17.468
You're in trouble now, Jaguars!

11:29.147 --> 11:31.732
Hey, Patrick.

11:31.816 --> 11:34.401
Hey. You're in my shop class, right?

11:34.486 --> 11:36.028
How's your clock coming?

11:36.112 --> 11:37.613
My dad's building it for me.

11:37.697 --> 11:40.657
Yeah. Mine looks like a boat.

11:40.742 --> 11:42.910
You wanna sit over here
or are you waiting for your friends?

11:42.994 --> 11:44.578
No, no, no, I'll sit.

11:47.499 --> 11:49.708
Thanks for not calling
me Nothing by the way.

11:49.793 --> 11:51.377
It's an endless nightmare.

11:51.461 --> 11:53.941
And these assholes,
they actually think they're being original.

11:55.715 --> 11:57.716
So do you like football?

11:57.801 --> 11:58.884
Love it. Love football.

11:58.968 --> 12:00.469
Maybe you know my brother then.

12:00.553 --> 12:02.054
Hey, Sam.

12:02.138 --> 12:05.224
Question. Could the bathrooms
here be more disgusting?

12:05.308 --> 12:07.267
Yes. They call it the men's room.

12:08.561 --> 12:11.063
So I finally got hold of Bob.

12:11.147 --> 12:13.107
Party tonight?

12:13.191 --> 12:16.652
He's still trying to shag
that waitress from the Olive Garden.

12:16.736 --> 12:18.153
He's never tossing that salad.

12:21.491 --> 12:23.033
Come on!

12:25.412 --> 12:26.578
Patrick.

12:26.663 --> 12:27.496
Yeah?

12:27.580 --> 12:28.997
Who's this?

12:29.082 --> 12:30.040
This is-

12:30.792 --> 12:31.875
Charlie Kelmeckis.

12:31.960 --> 12:33.252
Kelmeckis?

12:33.336 --> 12:36.463
No shit? Your sister's dating
Ponytail Derek, isn't she?

12:36.548 --> 12:38.340
- God.
- Is that what they call him?

12:38.425 --> 12:40.259
Would you leave Ponytail Derek alone?

12:40.343 --> 12:42.511
You put the "ass" in "class," Patrick.

12:42.595 --> 12:44.596
I try. Sam, I try.

12:44.681 --> 12:47.808
It's nice to meet you, Charlie.
I'm Sam.

12:47.892 --> 12:50.727
- What's the plan? Are we going
to Mary Elizabeth's tonight?
- Nope.

12:50.812 --> 12:53.647
She got caught watering down her parents'
brandy with iced tea.

12:53.731 --> 12:55.441
Let’s just go to Kings.

12:55.525 --> 12:59.903
All right. We're goin' to Kings
after the game if you wanna come.

13:18.089 --> 13:19.590
Do you have a favorite band?

13:19.674 --> 13:21.925
Well, I think The Smiths are my favorite.

13:22.010 --> 13:25.846
Are you kidding?
I love The Smiths. Best breakup band ever.

13:25.930 --> 13:27.347
What's your favorite song?

13:27.432 --> 13:30.225
"Asleep." It’s from Louder than Bombs.

13:30.310 --> 13:32.561
I heard it on Ponytail Derek's mix tape.

13:32.645 --> 13:34.146
That works on so many levels.

13:34.230 --> 13:36.607
I can make you guys a copy if you want.

13:36.691 --> 13:39.651
- What about Eides? You love Eides, right?
- Yeah, of course. They're great.

13:39.694 --> 13:41.403
Not a band, Charlie.

13:41.488 --> 13:42.905
It's a record store downtown.

13:42.989 --> 13:45.032
Things sound so much better on vinyl.

13:45.116 --> 13:47.676
You know, I used to be popular
before Sam got me some good music.

13:47.702 --> 13:50.579
So you be careful.
She'll ruin your life forever.

13:50.663 --> 13:51.830
That's okay.

13:51.915 --> 13:54.333
- Hey, Nothing.
- Hey, Nothing.

13:54.417 --> 13:56.710
Let it go! Jesus!

13:56.794 --> 13:59.463
It's an antique joke. It's over.

13:59.547 --> 14:01.715
So what are you gonna do when you
get outta this place?

14:01.799 --> 14:04.843
Well, my Aunt Helen said
I should be a writer...

14:04.928 --> 14:06.512
but I don't know what I'd write about.

14:06.596 --> 14:08.263
You could write about us.

14:08.348 --> 14:11.808
Yeah! Call it Slut and the Falcon.

14:11.893 --> 14:13.393
Make us solve crimes.

14:13.478 --> 14:15.729
You guys seem really happy together.

14:15.813 --> 14:17.733
How long have you been
boyfriend and girlfriend?

14:20.109 --> 14:23.028
He's not my boyfriend. He's my stepbrother.

14:23.112 --> 14:25.447
My mom finally left my worthless dad...

14:25.532 --> 14:28.242
and married his nice dad
when we moved here.

14:28.326 --> 14:30.286
But she's not bitter or anything.
Make no mistake.

14:30.328 --> 14:34.248
Absolutely not. Charlie, I'm not a bulimic.

14:34.332 --> 14:37.543
- I'm a bulim-ist.
- I'm sorry, I don't know what that is.

14:37.627 --> 14:39.670
She just really believes in bulimia.

14:39.754 --> 14:41.296
I love bulimia!

14:46.761 --> 14:48.470
Hey. Thanks for paying, Charlie.

14:48.555 --> 14:50.639
No problem. Thank you guys for the ride.

14:50.723 --> 14:52.975
Maybe I'll see you around in school?

14:53.059 --> 14:57.521
- God, would you turn it down?
You're gonna make us deaf.
- So be it. It's rock and roll.

14:58.398 --> 14:59.606
Bye, Charlie!

14:59.691 --> 15:01.733
- Bye, Charlie.
- Okay, bye.

15:13.246 --> 15:15.581
Your mom says,
"Don't go to Columbia with Candace, Derek."

15:15.665 --> 15:17.374
- Shh! Shut—
- "Don't go to Columbia!"

15:17.458 --> 15:19.459
Do you always want to
be a mama's boy, Derek?

15:19.544 --> 15:20.836
I am not a mama's boy!

15:20.920 --> 15:22.796
You are, because
every single time I go to your house...

15:22.880 --> 15:23.880
Every single time!

15:23.965 --> 15:25.841
Shut up, Candace!

15:25.925 --> 15:28.844
You just stand there
like a little bitch dog.

15:28.928 --> 15:33.015
No. Charlie—
Charlie, just go. I can handle it.

15:33.099 --> 15:35.183
Just don't wake up Mom and Dad.

16:02.712 --> 16:04.921
Hey! Look who's here.

16:06.382 --> 16:08.133
Welcome home, Aunt Helen.

16:08.217 --> 16:11.219
Aw! Look at you guys.

16:11.304 --> 16:13.096
Dressed so nice.

16:21.522 --> 16:22.939
Hey, Candace.

16:24.609 --> 16:26.151
What are you doing?

16:27.904 --> 16:31.573
Look, I egged him on. You saw it.

16:31.658 --> 16:35.994
He's never hit me before, and I promise
you, he will never hit me again.

16:36.079 --> 16:38.080
Like Aunt Helen's boyfriends?

16:42.460 --> 16:45.128
Charlie, this is Ponytail Derek.

16:45.963 --> 16:47.464
I can handle him.

16:49.676 --> 16:51.176
Do you trust me?

16:54.222 --> 16:56.390
Please, don't tell Mom and Dad.

17:36.639 --> 17:39.266
My God, they're playing good music!

17:39.350 --> 17:42.310
Holy shit. Holy shit! They are!
They're playing good music.

17:42.395 --> 17:44.896
- Living room routine.
- Living room routine.

17:44.981 --> 17:46.857
- Yes.
- Yes!

17:46.941 --> 17:48.775
Excuse us. Excuse me. Pardon.

17:48.860 --> 17:50.444
Sorry.

17:50.528 --> 17:53.363

It's not like it's cute or original.

19:29.210 --> 19:32.420
- You'd hope it would be warm.
- Yeah, piss off, Tennessee Tuxedo.

19:32.505 --> 19:34.673
Are you sure it's okay that I come?

19:34.757 --> 19:37.801
Yeah, of course.
Just remember, Charlie, Bob's not paranoid.

19:37.885 --> 19:39.177
He's sensitive.

19:39.262 --> 19:41.012
Sam!

19:41.097 --> 19:44.307
That waitress from the Olive Garden,
she was such a tease.

19:45.351 --> 19:46.726
Will you marry me?

19:46.811 --> 19:48.395
Only with Patrick's blessing.

19:48.479 --> 19:50.021
Patrick?

19:50.106 --> 19:52.357
You are a hopeless stoner
who attends the culinary institute.

19:52.441 --> 19:55.819
I'm gonna say "no" on that,
but nice try. Charlie.

19:55.903 --> 19:57.529
Touché.

20:05.413 --> 20:09.207
So, Charlie. This is a party.

20:18.634 --> 20:20.468
This is what fun looks like.

20:22.221 --> 20:24.180
Are you ready to meet some desperate women?

20:24.265 --> 20:25.807
Here, have a seat.

20:25.892 --> 20:26.933
Hey, ladies.

20:27.727 --> 20:29.436
Meet Charlie.

20:30.855 --> 20:32.606
- Hi.
- Meet ladies.

20:32.690 --> 20:33.982
- Hey.
- Mary Elizabeth.

20:34.066 --> 20:35.525
- Alice.
- Nice to meet you.

20:35.610 --> 20:37.068
This is Charlie's first party ever.

20:37.153 --> 20:42.157
So I expect nice, meaningful,
heartfelt blowjobs from both of you.

20:42.241 --> 20:44.826
Patrick, you're such a dick.
Where the hell did you go?

20:44.911 --> 20:47.454
- The dance was a little boring, don't you think?
- You are so selfish.

20:47.538 --> 20:49.998
We looked everywhere for you.
You could have told someone.

20:50.082 --> 20:51.458
Cry me a river.

20:51.542 --> 20:54.920
How is it that you've got meaner since
becoming a Buddhist?

20:55.004 --> 20:56.254
Just lucky, I guess.

20:56.339 --> 20:57.631
No, you're doing something wrong, I think.

20:57.715 --> 20:59.215
Or something very right.

20:59.300 --> 21:01.301
- Yeah, well—
- Hey!

21:01.385 --> 21:03.011
Look who's here.

21:05.056 --> 21:06.556
Is that Brad Hays?

21:06.641 --> 21:08.642
Yeah. He comes here sometimes.

21:08.726 --> 21:10.810
But he's a popular kid.

21:10.895 --> 21:12.979
Then what are we?

21:13.064 --> 21:16.733
Charlie! You look like
you could use a brownie.

21:17.234 --> 21:18.902
Thank you.

21:18.986 --> 21:22.113
I was so hungry at the dance.
I was gonna go to Kings...

21:22.198 --> 21:23.907
but I didn't really have any time.

21:24.492 --> 21:25.533
Thanks.

21:39.298 --> 21:41.257
Have you guys felt this carpet?

21:41.342 --> 21:43.677
This carpet feels so darn good.

21:49.767 --> 21:52.352
Charlie, Charlie,
what do you think about high school?

21:52.436 --> 21:53.728
High school?

21:54.230 --> 21:56.481
Bullshit.

21:56.565 --> 21:58.525
The cafeteria is called
the Nutrition Center.

21:58.609 --> 22:01.987
People wear their letter jackets
even when it's 98 degrees out.

22:02.071 --> 22:04.864
And why do they give out
letter jackets to marching band?

22:05.658 --> 22:07.742
It's not a sport.

22:07.827 --> 22:09.160
We all know it.

22:09.245 --> 22:11.371
This kid is crazy.

22:11.455 --> 22:13.707
Mary Elizabeth,
I think you’re really gonna regret that...

22:13.791 --> 22:17.585
you know— haircut when you
look back at old photographs.

22:17.670 --> 22:19.921
My God!

22:20.006 --> 22:22.590
I'm really sorry.
That sounded like a compliment in my head.

22:22.675 --> 22:23.550
My God!

22:23.634 --> 22:24.634
Well, it's kinda true.

22:24.719 --> 22:26.094
Shut up!

22:26.178 --> 22:28.304
I can't even be mad at him. Look at him.

22:28.389 --> 22:29.723
Bob, did you get him stoned?

22:29.807 --> 22:31.933
Come on, Sam, he likes
it, just look at him.

22:33.102 --> 22:34.561
How do you feel, Charlie?

22:36.230 --> 22:37.564
I just really want a milk shake.

22:46.657 --> 22:47.991
Sam...

22:50.619 --> 22:53.705
You have such pretty brown eyes.

22:53.789 --> 22:55.415
The kind of pretty that deserves to make...

22:55.499 --> 22:57.834
a big deal about itself though,
you know what I mean?

22:59.503 --> 23:03.548
Okay, Charlie. Let me make the milk shake.

23:03.632 --> 23:06.760
What a great word. Milk shake.

23:06.844 --> 23:10.847
It's like when you say your name over
and over again in the mirror...

23:10.931 --> 23:13.099
and after a while it sounds crazy.

23:13.184 --> 23:15.518
So I'm guessing you've
never been high before?

23:15.603 --> 23:18.104
No. No, no, no.

23:18.189 --> 23:20.690
My best friend, Michael,
his dad was a big drinker...

23:20.775 --> 23:23.359
so he hated all that stuff.

23:23.444 --> 23:24.486
Parties too.

23:24.570 --> 23:26.071
Well, where is Michael tonight?

23:26.155 --> 23:28.615
He shot himself last May.

23:33.621 --> 23:36.289
I kinda wished he'd left a note.
You know what I mean?

23:43.464 --> 23:45.006
Where's the bathroom?

23:47.134 --> 23:48.176
It's up the stairs.

23:48.260 --> 23:49.552
Thanks, Sam.

23:49.637 --> 23:51.346
You're so nice.

24:04.318 --> 24:05.652
Charlie.

24:08.864 --> 24:10.031
Weird.

24:17.331 --> 24:18.331
Charlie.

24:18.415 --> 24:19.791
What...

24:20.835 --> 24:22.252
Who was that kid?

24:22.336 --> 24:24.796
Relax. Relax. He's a friend of mine.

24:25.381 --> 24:26.631
Stay here.

24:26.715 --> 24:28.383
I didn't see anything.

24:28.467 --> 24:30.677
Yeah, I know you saw something,
but it's okay.

24:31.595 --> 24:33.138
Okay, listen...

24:34.515 --> 24:36.432
Brad doesn't want anyone to know.

24:38.185 --> 24:39.310
Wait.

24:40.187 --> 24:43.231
- Are you baked?
- Like a cake.

24:43.315 --> 24:45.316
That's what Bob said.

24:45.401 --> 24:47.986
And you can't have three on a match
because then they'd find us.

24:48.070 --> 24:50.613
And everybody laughed
but I don't understand what's funny.

24:51.615 --> 24:55.034
Okay, Charlie, listen.

24:56.537 --> 24:58.454
I need you to promise...

24:58.539 --> 25:01.916
that you're not gonna say anything
to anyone about me and Brad.

25:03.127 --> 25:05.170
Okay? This has to be our little secret.

25:05.963 --> 25:09.215
Our little secret. Agreed.

25:10.092 --> 25:11.092
Okay.

25:11.177 --> 25:12.802
Thank you.

25:12.887 --> 25:14.012
We'll talk later.

25:16.849 --> 25:18.766
I look forward to that big talk.

25:21.770 --> 25:24.063
Can I have your cherry?

25:24.148 --> 25:27.775
Isn't this the best milk shake ever, Alice?

25:27.860 --> 25:29.444
It's even better than the first one.

25:35.284 --> 25:37.911
Charlie just told me that
his best friend shot himself.

25:41.081 --> 25:43.499
I don't think he has any friends.

25:50.758 --> 25:52.383
Hey, everyone!

25:52.468 --> 25:53.718
Everybody!

25:55.763 --> 25:58.389
Everyone...

25:58.474 --> 26:00.475
raise your glasses to Charlie.

26:02.478 --> 26:05.355
- What did I do?
- You didn't do anything.

26:05.439 --> 26:07.690
We just wanna toast to our new friend.

26:07.775 --> 26:09.359
You see things.

26:09.443 --> 26:11.069
And you understand.

26:12.738 --> 26:13.821
You're a wallflower.

26:17.618 --> 26:18.618
What is it? What's wrong?

26:20.246 --> 26:22.372
I didn't think anyone noticed me.

26:25.834 --> 26:29.045
Well, we didn't think
there was anyone cool left to meet.

26:29.129 --> 26:31.172
So come on, everyone.

26:33.425 --> 26:34.801
To Charlie.

26:34.885 --> 26:36.302
To Charlie.

26:40.599 --> 26:43.142
Welcome to the Island of Misfit Toys.

26:53.487 --> 26:55.321
My God! What is this song?

26:55.406 --> 26:56.948
Right? I have no idea.

26:57.032 --> 26:58.783
Have you ever heard this before?

26:59.368 --> 27:00.535
Never.

27:02.246 --> 27:04.080
Patrick, we've gotta go through the tunnel.

27:04.164 --> 27:05.540
Sam, it's freezing.

27:05.624 --> 27:06.708
Patrick, It's the perfect song.

27:06.792 --> 27:09.043
No. Mama Patrick says "No."

27:09.128 --> 27:12.672
Patrick. It's Sam.
It's Sam speaking to you right now.

27:12.756 --> 27:14.507
I'm begging you to do this for me.

27:14.591 --> 27:15.258
I concede!

27:18.345 --> 27:19.554
What is she doing?

27:19.638 --> 27:21.556
Don't worry. She does it all the time.

27:25.436 --> 27:27.312
Turn it up!

27:27.396 --> 27:29.105
You got it, your highness.

28:29.708 --> 28:31.042
Dear friend...

28:32.669 --> 28:34.379
I'm sorry I haven't written for a while...

28:34.463 --> 28:37.048
but I've been trying
hard not to be a loser.

28:38.550 --> 28:41.094
For example, I'm trying to participate...

28:41.178 --> 28:43.596
by listening to Sam's collection
of big rock ballads...

28:43.680 --> 28:45.181
and thinking about love.

28:46.850 --> 28:49.435
Sam says they're kitschy and brilliant.

28:49.520 --> 28:50.978
I completely agree.

28:54.858 --> 28:59.070
I'm also writing essays
and studying extra books outside of class.

28:59.154 --> 29:01.948
As it turns out, Mr. Anderson is a writer.

29:02.032 --> 29:03.950
He even had a play put
up in New York once...

29:04.034 --> 29:06.035
which I think is very impressive.

29:06.120 --> 29:07.787
Great Gatsby?

29:07.871 --> 29:11.082
He and his wife might go back there
after this year.

29:11.166 --> 29:14.460
I know this is selfish,
but I really hope he doesn't.

29:15.796 --> 29:17.338
My favorite time, though, is lunch...

29:17.423 --> 29:19.966
because I get to see Sam and Patrick.

29:20.050 --> 29:22.760
We spend the time working on
Mary Elizabeth's fanzine...

29:22.845 --> 29:25.555
about music and
The Rocky Horror Picture Show.

29:25.639 --> 29:27.765
It's called Punk Rocky.

29:27.850 --> 29:29.809
Mary Elizabeth is really interesting...

29:29.893 --> 29:32.270
because she's a Buddhist and a punk.

29:32.354 --> 29:37.191
But somehow she always acts like my father
at the end of a long day.

29:37.276 --> 29:39.277
Her best friend Alice loves vampires...

29:39.361 --> 29:40.945
and wants to go to film school.

29:41.029 --> 29:43.322
She also steals jeans from the mall.

29:43.407 --> 29:46.367
I don't know why, because
her family is rich...

29:46.452 --> 29:48.077
but I'm trying not to be judgmental.

29:48.162 --> 29:52.165
Especially since I know that they
were all there for Patrick last year.

29:52.249 --> 29:54.041
Patrick never likes to be serious...

29:54.126 --> 29:57.086
so it took me a while to get what happened.

29:57.171 --> 30:02.049
When he was a junior, Patrick started
seeing Brad on the weekends in secret.

30:02.134 --> 30:03.843
I guess it was hard, too...

30:03.927 --> 30:07.346
because Brad had to
get drunk every time they fooled around.

30:07.431 --> 30:09.432
Then Monday in school, Brad would say...

30:09.516 --> 30:13.186
"Man, I was so wasted I
don't remember a thing."

30:13.270 --> 30:16.189
This went on for seven months.

30:16.273 --> 30:19.859
When they finally did it,
Brad said he loved Patrick.

30:19.943 --> 30:21.986
Then he started to cry.

30:22.070 --> 30:23.696
No matter what Patrick did...

30:23.780 --> 30:26.449
Brad kept saying that
his dad would kill him.

30:26.533 --> 30:29.327
And saying that he was going to hell.

30:29.411 --> 30:33.247
Patrick was eventually
able to help Brad get sober.

30:33.332 --> 30:35.208
I asked Patrick if he felt sad...

30:35.292 --> 30:38.127
that he still had to keep it a secret.

30:38.212 --> 30:40.922
And he said "No," because at least now...

30:41.006 --> 30:44.717
Brad doesn't have to get drunk to love him.

30:44.801 --> 30:49.222
I think I understand,
because I really like Sam.

30:49.306 --> 30:50.973
I asked my sister about her...

30:51.058 --> 30:52.892
and she said that when
Sam was a freshman...

30:52.976 --> 30:56.312
the upperclass men used to
get her drunk at parties.

30:56.396 --> 30:58.481
I guess she had a reputation.

30:58.565 --> 31:00.024
But I don't care.

31:00.108 --> 31:04.654
I'd hate for her to judge me based on
what I used to be like.

31:04.738 --> 31:07.698
So I've been making her
a mix tape so she'll know how I feel.

31:09.785 --> 31:11.285
Shit!

31:11.370 --> 31:13.621
- C!
- C!

31:13.705 --> 31:14.622
- Give me a K!
- K!

31:14.706 --> 31:16.332
- Give me a Y!
- Y!

31:16.416 --> 31:17.416
What's that spell?

31:17.501 --> 31:18.501
Rocky!

31:18.585 --> 31:19.669
I can't hear you!

31:19.753 --> 31:20.670
Rocky!

31:20.754 --> 31:22.046
One more time!

31:22.130 --> 31:24.090
Rocky!

What did you use?

33:15.327 --> 33:17.161
I know. Thank you.

33:17.245 --> 33:20.331
Color film,
but black and white paper for printing.

33:20.415 --> 33:22.667
Yeah. My professor gave me an A...

33:22.751 --> 33:24.377
but for all the wrong reasons.

33:24.461 --> 33:26.212
Most of them are idiots.

33:26.296 --> 33:28.381
You'll see what I mean
when you get to college.

33:28.465 --> 33:30.091
How'd your S.A.T.'s go, by the way?

33:30.175 --> 33:33.344
1150. I think I'll get into NYU.

33:33.428 --> 33:34.387
Yeah, I hope so.

33:34.471 --> 33:37.765
1490. Harvard. Face.

33:40.352 --> 33:41.602
So-

33:41.687 --> 33:42.978
Are you okay?

33:43.063 --> 33:44.939
Yeah. Yeah.

33:46.108 --> 33:48.943
But I got my S.A.T. results back.

33:49.486 --> 33:50.695
Oops.

33:50.779 --> 33:53.572
You can take them again, you know.

33:53.657 --> 33:56.367
Yeah, it’s just,
if I'm going to Penn State main campus...

33:56.451 --> 33:58.327
I have to do much better.

33:58.412 --> 34:00.579
I wish I would have studied freshman year.

34:01.957 --> 34:04.125
It's a bit of a mess.

34:05.502 --> 34:07.920
I'll help you study for the next one.

34:08.004 --> 34:09.505
Will you?

34:09.589 --> 34:10.840
Yeah. Of course.

34:12.134 --> 34:13.676
Thanks, Charlie.

34:26.148 --> 34:27.565
What's this?

34:27.649 --> 34:31.235
It’s just a mix tape. No big deal.

34:31.319 --> 34:33.279
My parents have a good stereo, so...

34:34.989 --> 34:37.449
It's all about that night in the tunnel.

34:37.534 --> 34:39.654
I couldn't find that song
that we were listening to...

34:39.661 --> 34:42.413
but, you know, I'm still
searching for it, so yeah.

34:42.496 --> 34:43.706
That's okay.

34:44.833 --> 34:46.375
These are great.

34:47.377 --> 34:49.085
Nick Drake.

34:49.170 --> 34:51.338
The Shaggs.

34:51.422 --> 34:54.467
You have really good taste, Charlie.

34:54.551 --> 34:55.634
Really?

34:55.719 --> 34:56.927
Yeah.

34:57.012 --> 34:59.180
Way better than me as a freshman.

34:59.264 --> 35:01.140
I used to listen to the worst Top 40.

35:01.224 --> 35:03.392
- No.
- Yeah, I did.

35:04.853 --> 35:06.854
Then I heard this old song.

35:08.023 --> 35:10.149
"Pearly Dewdrops' Drop."

35:10.233 --> 35:13.944
And I thought someday I'd be at a
party in college or something...

35:14.029 --> 35:19.200
and I'd look up and see
this person across the room.

35:19.284 --> 35:21.452
And from that moment, I'd know...

35:21.536 --> 35:24.246
everything was going to be okay.

35:25.707 --> 35:27.041
You know what I mean?

35:29.211 --> 35:30.294
Yeah.

35:46.561 --> 35:48.229
I hope it works out.

35:48.313 --> 35:50.231
I don't know.

35:50.315 --> 35:52.817
Craig would be
a big step up from her last boyfriend.

35:52.901 --> 35:53.984
Yeah, no shit.

35:54.069 --> 35:56.153
Who could forget Mr. Car Wash Loser?

35:56.238 --> 35:59.490
I just hope she can stop playing dumb
with these guys.

35:59.574 --> 36:03.118
I keep telling her, "Don't
make yourself small."

36:04.162 --> 36:05.913
Can't save anybody.

36:07.290 --> 36:08.749
Excuse me.

36:08.834 --> 36:11.377
Man, your mix is morbidly sad, kid.

36:11.461 --> 36:13.921
How about something
a little bit more upbeat?

36:14.005 --> 36:15.714
Let’s just see.

36:15.799 --> 36:17.925
So Sam tells me you wanna be a writer.

36:19.803 --> 36:21.053
Yeah.

36:21.137 --> 36:22.429
Don't you write poetry, Craig?

36:25.267 --> 36:29.270
Poetry writes me. You know?

36:30.647 --> 36:31.939
Let's get this party started.

36:54.546 --> 36:56.046
Wow.

36:56.131 --> 36:58.132
That was fast.

36:58.216 --> 36:59.300
You want another one?

36:59.384 --> 37:00.426
Yeah.

37:00.510 --> 37:01.552
All right.

37:10.604 --> 37:11.937
Mr. Anderson?

37:14.024 --> 37:15.065
Can I ask you something?

37:15.150 --> 37:17.234
Yeah.

37:17.319 --> 37:23.157
Why do nice people choose
the wrong people to date?

37:24.576 --> 37:26.619
Are we talking about anyone specific?

37:28.079 --> 37:29.413
Well...

37:33.001 --> 37:36.420
We accept the love we think we deserve.

37:36.504 --> 37:39.173
Can we make them know
that they deserve more?

37:39.257 --> 37:41.008
We can try.

37:59.027 --> 38:01.236
- Hey.
- Hey, Sam. Didn't see you come in.

38:01.321 --> 38:02.947
How's it goin'?

38:03.031 --> 38:05.908
You wanna start work on
probability and statistics?

38:05.992 --> 38:07.201
Yeah. Sure.

38:07.285 --> 38:10.579
Page 291 in your book.

38:12.040 --> 38:14.208
And I ordered you some breakfast.

38:14.292 --> 38:16.085
The country breakfast.

38:32.727 --> 38:34.186
Dad?

38:34.270 --> 38:36.397
Can I have 30 dollars?

38:36.481 --> 38:38.649
Twenty dollars?
What do you need 10 dollars for?

38:38.733 --> 38:40.025
Sam's doing Secret Santa.

38:40.110 --> 38:42.403
It's her favorite thing in the world.
Please?

38:45.365 --> 38:46.490
Have fun.

38:48.743 --> 38:49.910
Thanks.

39:02.132 --> 39:03.507
Charlie.

39:03.591 --> 39:06.343
This was my favorite book growing up.

39:06.428 --> 39:09.680
This is my copy, but I want you to have it.

39:11.099 --> 39:12.391
Thanks.

39:12.475 --> 39:13.851
Have a great Christmas break.

39:13.935 --> 39:15.686
You, too, Mr. Anderson.

39:18.690 --> 39:19.773
Terrible stain.

39:22.944 --> 39:26.780
That's pretty good, Charlie.

39:33.371 --> 39:34.830
You gotta be kidding me.

39:34.914 --> 39:37.291
If you fail me, you get me next semester.

39:41.463 --> 39:43.505
Whoo!

39:45.175 --> 39:48.594
C minus!
Ladies and gentlemen, I am below average!

39:48.678 --> 39:51.055
- Below average!
- Below average!

39:51.139 --> 39:52.723
Guys, 1210.

39:52.807 --> 39:53.849
What?

39:55.351 --> 39:59.229
No more applications! No more S.A.T.'s!

39:59.314 --> 40:01.106
Thank you, Charlie!

40:01.191 --> 40:03.984
All right. All right, guys, I got...

40:04.069 --> 40:07.154
Multiple pairs of bluejeans.

40:07.238 --> 40:08.739
Wow, this is a really tough one...

40:08.823 --> 40:10.908
but I'm gonna have to guess Alice.

40:10.992 --> 40:11.950
Wait.

40:12.035 --> 40:15.370
Guys, a receipt! She actually paid!

40:15.455 --> 40:17.414
I'm so touched!

40:17.499 --> 40:18.582
Where's Craig?

40:18.666 --> 40:20.167
He went home to Connecticut.

40:20.251 --> 40:22.461
But he'll be back for New Year's Eve.

40:22.545 --> 40:25.506
Sorry we won't be seeing him tonight.

40:25.590 --> 40:29.468
All right, big brother by three weeks,
who's your Secret Santa?

40:29.552 --> 40:31.136
I'll tell you, Sam.

40:31.221 --> 40:32.596
This one's tough.

40:32.680 --> 40:34.848
I have received a harmonica...

40:34.933 --> 40:36.934
a Magnetic Poetry set...

40:37.018 --> 40:38.811
a book about Harvey Milk...

40:38.895 --> 40:43.565
and a mix tape with
the song "Asleep" on it twice.

40:43.650 --> 40:45.275
I mean, I have no idea.

40:45.360 --> 40:48.112
This collection of presents is so gay...

40:48.196 --> 40:50.614
that I think I must have
given them to myself.

40:50.698 --> 40:53.033
But despite that distinct possibility...

40:53.118 --> 40:55.536
I'm gonna have to go with...

40:55.620 --> 40:56.662
Drum roll.

40:57.997 --> 41:00.415
Charlie.

41:00.500 --> 41:01.667
Obviously.

41:01.751 --> 41:02.876
Beautifully done.

41:02.961 --> 41:05.546
All right, Charlie. It's your turn.

41:06.297 --> 41:07.714
Okay.

41:07.799 --> 41:10.968
Okey dokey.

41:11.052 --> 41:17.558
I have received socks, pants,
a shirt and a belt.

41:17.642 --> 41:20.269
I was ordered to wear
them all tonight, so...

41:20.353 --> 41:24.398
Guessing my Secret Santa is Mary Elizabeth.

41:24.482 --> 41:26.108
Now why do you say that?

41:26.192 --> 41:28.569
You know, she bosses
people around sometimes.

41:28.653 --> 41:29.820
Sorry.

41:29.904 --> 41:32.698
- What the hell is wrong with you?
- Sorry.

41:32.782 --> 41:35.701
You'll be surprised to know
that your Secret Santa is actually me.

41:36.578 --> 41:37.870
Why all the clothes?

41:37.954 --> 41:41.165
Well, all the great writers
used to wear great suits.

41:41.249 --> 41:44.751
So your last present
is on a towel rack in the bathroom.

41:44.836 --> 41:47.212
Delve into our facilities.

41:47.297 --> 41:49.173
Emerge a star.

41:49.257 --> 41:50.340
Perfect.

41:50.425 --> 41:51.675
Will you hand these out while I'm gone?

41:51.759 --> 41:53.093
Wait a second.

41:53.178 --> 41:55.179
There's only Secret Santa presents.
There's rules.

41:55.263 --> 41:58.390
Mary Elizabeth, why are you
trying to eat Christmas?

41:58.474 --> 41:59.766
Hand them out, Sam.

41:59.851 --> 42:02.769
All right. Mary Elizabeth. For you.

42:03.771 --> 42:04.771
Alice.

42:04.856 --> 42:06.023
Thanks.

42:06.816 --> 42:07.816
Bob.

42:10.111 --> 42:11.862
And this one's for me.

42:11.946 --> 42:14.615
"Alice, I know you’ll get into NYU."

42:14.699 --> 42:18.952
Forty dollars to print
Punk Rocky in color next time.

42:20.121 --> 42:22.289
He knows me.

42:22.373 --> 42:23.999
He really knows me.

42:39.349 --> 42:41.225
All right, Charlie.

42:41.976 --> 42:43.060
Come on out.

42:43.144 --> 42:44.269
Get out here, buddy.

42:44.354 --> 42:45.479
Come on, Charlie. Charlie!

42:46.648 --> 42:48.982
Don't be shy.

42:49.067 --> 42:51.777
Come out, come out, wherever...

42:59.244 --> 43:00.911
Yeah!

43:00.995 --> 43:05.332
What a display of man I have never seen!

43:06.668 --> 43:08.085
Where are we going?

43:08.169 --> 43:09.836
It's a surprise.

43:12.048 --> 43:13.423
Is this your room?

43:18.179 --> 43:19.346
So cool.

43:20.181 --> 43:21.223
Thanks.

43:25.895 --> 43:28.313
You got me a present?

43:28.398 --> 43:30.732
After all your help
on my Penn State application?

43:31.442 --> 43:32.859
Of course I did.

43:34.779 --> 43:36.029
Open it!

43:41.077 --> 43:42.995
I don't know what to say.

43:43.079 --> 43:44.413
You don't have to say anything.

44:05.560 --> 44:08.145
I'm really sorry we can't
be here for your birthday.

44:08.229 --> 44:11.481
No, that's okay. I'm just sorry
you have to go back and visit your dad.

44:11.566 --> 44:14.318
I'm in such a good mood
I don't think even he could ruin it.

44:14.402 --> 44:16.820
I feel like I'm finally doing good.

44:16.904 --> 44:18.030
You are.

44:18.114 --> 44:20.907
Well, what about you?

44:20.992 --> 44:24.745
When I met you,
you were this scared freshman.

44:25.913 --> 44:27.414
Now look at you in that suit.

44:27.498 --> 44:30.834
You're like a sexy English schoolboy.

44:30.918 --> 44:32.336
I saw Mary Elizabeth checking you out.

44:32.420 --> 44:33.378
No.

44:34.088 --> 44:36.006
Innocent.

44:36.090 --> 44:37.507
Worst kinda guys.

44:37.592 --> 44:38.759
Never see you coming.

44:38.843 --> 44:41.053
And parents love you.

44:41.137 --> 44:43.388
That's, like...

44:43.473 --> 44:45.057
extra danger.

44:45.141 --> 44:47.184
Yeah, well, it hasn't worked so far.

44:47.268 --> 44:49.269
You've never had a girlfriend?

44:49.354 --> 44:51.438
Not even like a second grade Valentine?

44:51.522 --> 44:52.564
Nope.

44:52.648 --> 44:54.399
Have you ever kissed a girl?

44:54.484 --> 44:55.609
No.

44:56.819 --> 44:58.111
What about you?

45:01.991 --> 45:03.742
Have I ever kissed a girl?

45:03.826 --> 45:05.952
No, no. Your first kiss.

45:07.789 --> 45:09.706
I was 11.

45:09.791 --> 45:11.541
His name was Robert.

45:11.626 --> 45:13.919
He used to come over to
the house all the time.

45:14.003 --> 45:15.629
Was he your first boyfriend?

45:16.964 --> 45:19.049
He was my...

45:19.133 --> 45:21.301
He was my dad's boss.

45:24.222 --> 45:28.892
You know, Charlie, I used to sleep
with guys who treated me like shit.

45:28.976 --> 45:31.520
And get wasted all the time.

45:32.522 --> 45:33.980
But now I feel like...

45:34.899 --> 45:36.775
I have a chance. Like...

45:36.859 --> 45:39.152
I can even get into a real college.

45:39.237 --> 45:41.029
It's true. You can do it.

45:46.077 --> 45:47.786
You really think so?

45:52.041 --> 45:58.839
My aunt had that same thing
done to her, too.

45:58.923 --> 46:01.341
And she turned her life around.

46:03.010 --> 46:05.595
She must have been great.

46:05.680 --> 46:08.515
She was my favorite person in the world.

46:08.599 --> 46:09.850
Until now.

46:18.109 --> 46:19.443
Charlie...

46:21.362 --> 46:26.366
I know that you know I like Craig.

46:26.451 --> 46:29.870
But I want to forget about that
for a minute, okay?

46:29.954 --> 46:31.788
Okay.

46:31.873 --> 46:36.042
I just wanna make sure
that the first person who kisses you...

46:36.878 --> 46:38.503
loves you.

46:38.588 --> 46:39.796
Okay?

46:43.468 --> 46:44.926
Okay.

47:03.404 --> 47:05.238
I love you, Charlie.

47:08.409 --> 47:09.993
I love you, too.

47:16.501 --> 47:19.002
I wanna do Secret Santa forever!

47:25.343 --> 47:26.843
Have a good time at your mom's.

47:26.928 --> 47:29.721
Thanks. And, listen, Charlie.

47:29.805 --> 47:31.932
Because your birthday's on Christmas Eve...

47:32.016 --> 47:33.892
I figure you don't get that many presents?

47:35.436 --> 47:37.229
I thought you should have my clock.

47:37.313 --> 47:38.522
From the heart.

47:38.606 --> 47:40.357
Thank you, Patrick.

47:42.527 --> 47:43.777
Bye.

47:44.487 --> 47:47.030
Have a good one, guys.

47:47.114 --> 47:49.449
I love you guys!

47:55.790 --> 47:57.624
Hey!

47:57.708 --> 47:58.625
Look who's here.

48:01.379 --> 48:04.506
- Come here, little sister.
- Hey, Chris.

48:04.590 --> 48:06.883
Hey, honey.

48:06.968 --> 48:09.177
Ma, you look so thin.

48:09.262 --> 48:11.012
You. Look at you.

48:11.097 --> 48:12.138
Charlie.

48:15.351 --> 48:16.851
Come on, I got dinner ready.

48:16.936 --> 48:18.478
- Happy birthday.
- Thanks.

48:18.563 --> 48:19.896
Let's eat.

48:19.981 --> 48:21.773
Make a wish, honey.

48:33.160 --> 48:35.829
Can you see it, Charlie?

48:35.913 --> 48:39.874
The luminaria is a landing strip
for Santa Claus.

48:39.959 --> 48:43.336
Why don't you keep an eye out for him,
and I will be right back, okay?

48:45.631 --> 48:48.508
Going to get your birthday present.

48:59.437 --> 49:03.148
Hey.

49:04.775 --> 49:07.277
God, I miss Mom's cooking.

49:07.361 --> 49:09.404
You have no idea how good you have it.

49:11.115 --> 49:13.325
I'm actually starting to hate pizza.

49:14.910 --> 49:16.411
So how you liking school?

49:16.495 --> 49:20.040
Well, I'm no braniac like you or Candace.

49:20.791 --> 49:22.334
I'm doing okay.

49:22.418 --> 49:24.419
Okay? You're playing in a bowl game.

49:32.887 --> 49:34.679
How are you feeling, Charlie?

49:37.016 --> 49:37.849
Good.

49:37.933 --> 49:39.809
No, you know what I mean.

49:40.603 --> 49:41.853
Is it bad tonight?

49:42.980 --> 49:45.690
No.

49:46.942 --> 49:49.903
I'm not picturing things anymore.

49:49.987 --> 49:53.114
Or if I do, I can just shut it off.

49:54.992 --> 49:58.662
Well, you know, Mom did say
that you have good friends now.

49:58.746 --> 50:02.290
And maybe if it does get bad again...

50:02.375 --> 50:04.084
you can just talk to them. Yeah?

50:04.168 --> 50:06.294
Yeah.

50:06.379 --> 50:10.215
Especially Sam. She's great.

50:10.299 --> 50:12.884
I'm gonna ask her out at New Year's.

50:12.968 --> 50:14.594
I think the time is right now.

50:17.723 --> 50:25.723
- Body of Christ.
- Amen.

50:48.754 --> 50:50.797
How long does this take to work?

51:05.980 --> 51:07.731
Shovelin' snow?

51:08.941 --> 51:11.234
I have to get this driveway clean.

51:11.736 --> 51:13.194
And then...

51:13.279 --> 51:16.614
I'm going to congratulate
you on being happy.

51:16.699 --> 51:17.991
'Cause you deserve it.

51:19.410 --> 51:21.161
You said that an hour ago.

51:21.245 --> 51:22.454
Was that tonight?

51:25.833 --> 51:27.834
I just...

51:27.918 --> 51:30.670
saw this tree, but it was a dragon.

51:30.755 --> 51:33.131
Then it was a tree again
and it just lied to me.

51:33.215 --> 51:35.508
Okay, Charlie,
don't freak out. Give me this.

51:36.177 --> 51:37.469
Calm down.

51:41.390 --> 51:42.640
Look up.

51:45.311 --> 51:46.603
Isn't it quiet?

51:49.273 --> 51:52.192
Sam, do you think if people knew...

51:52.276 --> 51:55.779
how crazy you really were,
no one would ever talk to you?

51:57.865 --> 51:59.574
All the time.

52:03.454 --> 52:05.955
So you wanna wear these glasses?

52:08.209 --> 52:09.959
They'll protect you.

53:31.625 --> 53:34.711
10, 9, 8, 7...

53:34.795 --> 53:37.672
6, 5, 4...

53:37.756 --> 53:39.674
3, 2, 1!

53:39.758 --> 53:41.467
It's gonna be our little secret.

54:41.654 --> 54:43.529
Did your older friends pressure you?

54:43.614 --> 54:46.407
No one pressured me, Officer.

54:46.492 --> 54:49.953
I would never do drugs. Never.

54:50.037 --> 54:53.414
Then how did you happen to be passed out
on the ground at 6:00 in the morning?

54:55.125 --> 54:59.420
Well, I, um— I-I was really tired.

54:59.505 --> 55:02.507
And I was feeling feverish...

55:02.591 --> 55:07.303
so I went outside
for a walk just to get some cold air.

55:07.388 --> 55:09.806
I started seeing things, so I passed out.

55:09.890 --> 55:11.391
You're seeing things again, Charlie?

55:12.810 --> 55:14.686
Not really.

55:20.859 --> 55:22.360
Nice suit.

55:24.238 --> 55:26.030
It was a Christmas present.

55:30.744 --> 55:32.537
Did you have fun on your break?

55:32.621 --> 55:35.248
More fun than you're gonna
have today, Sinatra.

55:38.335 --> 55:39.794
Nice look, jag-off.

55:43.298 --> 55:45.008
I've called him 30 times.

55:45.092 --> 55:47.373
What are we supposed to do?
We're going on in 10 minutes.

55:48.679 --> 55:50.179
- They said in health class—
- Hello?

55:50.264 --> 55:52.348
They say that about
L.S.D.just to scare you.

55:52.433 --> 55:55.601
- Are you sure? You know I've seen—
- Charlie, you're fine, man.

55:55.686 --> 55:58.271
Guys, we have an emergency.

55:58.355 --> 55:59.981
Craig has flaked out on us again.

56:00.065 --> 56:01.607
So I need a Rocky.

56:01.692 --> 56:02.734
Brad?

56:02.818 --> 56:04.193
No. No way. No. I'm not...

56:04.278 --> 56:05.820
There's people out there. No.

56:09.783 --> 56:12.744
Charlie, take off your clothes.

Well, we're filled up now...

57:27.611 --> 57:29.987
but they're gonna
need people when we go to college.

57:30.072 --> 57:33.366
We could put in a good word for you.

57:33.450 --> 57:35.368
That'd be great. Thanks.

57:35.452 --> 57:36.285
Yeah.

57:39.206 --> 57:41.124
Charlie...

57:41.208 --> 57:44.460
Have you heard of the Sadie Hawkins dance?

57:44.545 --> 57:46.045
The one where the girl asks the guy?

57:46.130 --> 57:49.173
Obviously, it is completely stupid.

57:49.258 --> 57:52.802
And sexist. I mean, it's like
"Hey, thanks for the crumb."

57:52.886 --> 57:56.973
And normally, I would just blow it off,
because school dances suck torture.

57:57.057 --> 58:00.393
But, you know, it's my last year and...

58:03.814 --> 58:05.815
Would you maybe wanna go with me?

58:05.899 --> 58:07.692
You wanna go with me?

58:07.776 --> 58:10.653
Yeah, I'm sick of macho guys.

58:10.737 --> 58:13.156
Plus you looked really
cute in your costume.

58:13.240 --> 58:15.116
So what do you say?

58:19.580 --> 58:20.955
You must be Mary Elizabeth.

58:21.707 --> 58:22.623
Yes.

58:22.708 --> 58:24.000
It's so nice to meet you.

58:24.084 --> 58:25.793
You, too, Mrs. Kelmeckis.

58:25.878 --> 58:28.129
Charlie tells me you're a Buddhist.

58:28.213 --> 58:30.756
- Please, come in.
- Okay.

58:30.841 --> 58:32.300
A little closer together.

58:32.384 --> 58:33.843
That looks nice.

58:33.927 --> 58:35.928
Buddhist, I need you to
smile a little bit more.

58:36.013 --> 58:37.763
There you go. Nice.

59:08.795 --> 59:10.129
Hey.

59:10.214 --> 59:11.631
Hey.

59:11.715 --> 59:13.216
Are you having a good time?

59:15.719 --> 59:19.138
Not really. How about you?

59:19.848 --> 59:21.682
I mean, I don't know.

59:21.767 --> 59:24.227
It's my first date, I don't
have much to compare it to.

59:24.853 --> 59:26.312
You're doing fine.

59:30.234 --> 59:33.402
Sorry Craig couldn't come.

59:33.487 --> 59:37.531
Yeah. He said he didn't want to go to
some stupid high school dance.

59:37.616 --> 59:40.534
I can't say I blame him really.

59:40.619 --> 59:43.996
I don't know.
If you like it, he should come.

59:49.253 --> 59:50.544
Thanks, Charlie.

59:53.423 --> 59:55.633
Have a beautiful first date.

59:55.717 --> 59:57.718
You deserve it.

59:57.803 --> 59:59.387
I'll try not to make you too jealous.

01:00:13.610 --> 01:00:15.111
Now just let it breathe.

01:00:24.162 --> 01:00:24.996
Whoa.

01:00:27.165 --> 01:00:29.000
It sure is a nice house.

01:00:29.084 --> 01:00:30.293
Thanks.

01:00:35.382 --> 01:00:38.050
Don't you just love old music?

01:00:38.135 --> 01:00:39.510
Yeah.

01:00:39.594 --> 01:00:42.555
Good. 'Cause I made you a mix of it.

01:00:44.182 --> 01:00:47.435
I'd love to expose you
to great things like...

01:00:47.519 --> 01:00:50.229
Billie Holiday and foreign films.

01:00:50.314 --> 01:00:53.524
This merlot is really fancy.

01:00:53.608 --> 01:00:56.402
Yeah. My dad collects wine,
but he doesn't drink.

01:00:56.486 --> 01:00:57.987
That's kinda weird, isn't it?

01:00:58.071 --> 01:01:01.157
I guess. Where are your parents?

01:01:01.241 --> 01:01:04.035
Their club's hosting
a cotillion or something racist.

01:01:06.371 --> 01:01:07.913
They'll be gone all night.

01:01:14.338 --> 01:01:16.172
Sure is a nice fire.

01:01:17.716 --> 01:01:19.258
Yeah.

01:01:19.343 --> 01:01:20.676
When I'm done being a lobbyist...

01:01:20.761 --> 01:01:23.804
I wanna move to a house
like this in Cape Cod.

01:01:23.889 --> 01:01:25.181
Sounds nice, doesn't it?

01:01:25.265 --> 01:01:26.265
Yeah.

01:01:31.980 --> 01:01:34.273
Your heart is beating really fast.

01:01:34.358 --> 01:01:35.691
Is it?

01:01:35.776 --> 01:01:37.985
Here. Feel.

01:01:43.450 --> 01:01:45.451
Charlie?

01:01:46.620 --> 01:01:47.953
Do you like me?

01:01:49.122 --> 01:01:50.206
You know what I mean.

01:01:50.290 --> 01:01:51.665
I think so.

01:01:52.626 --> 01:01:54.377
Don't be nervous.

01:02:31.873 --> 01:02:33.165
Charlie.

01:02:36.253 --> 01:02:38.379
I didn't know how tonight
was gonna go, but...

01:02:39.923 --> 01:02:41.090
It's really nice, isn't it?

01:02:41.174 --> 01:02:42.508
Yeah.

01:02:44.553 --> 01:02:46.095
I just can't believe it.

01:02:47.264 --> 01:02:48.931
You, of all people.

01:02:49.015 --> 01:02:51.600
I just can't believe you're my boyfriend.

01:02:57.190 --> 01:02:59.358
Shit! My parents! Shit!

01:02:59.443 --> 01:03:01.610
- Here, zip this up.
- Okay. No, I got this.

01:03:01.695 --> 01:03:03.135
Just zip it up like a normal zipper!

01:03:03.196 --> 01:03:04.321
It's stuck. It’s just...

01:03:05.198 --> 01:03:06.824
Thank you.

01:03:06.908 --> 01:03:08.033
See you Monday.

01:03:09.369 --> 01:03:11.954
Dear friend...

01:03:12.038 --> 01:03:15.207
sorry I haven't written for a while...

01:03:15.292 --> 01:03:17.877
but things are a total disaster.

01:03:19.212 --> 01:03:21.839
We're literally making
out and I'm in my bra...

01:03:21.923 --> 01:03:23.507
Hello!
And the front door opens, it's my parents!

01:03:23.592 --> 01:03:25.801
I probably should have been honest about...

01:03:25.886 --> 01:03:28.971
how I didn't want to go out with
Mary Elizabeth after Sadie's, but...

01:03:29.055 --> 01:03:31.307
I really didn't want to hurt her feelings.

01:03:32.559 --> 01:03:35.478
You see, Mary Elizabeth
is a really nice person...

01:03:35.562 --> 01:03:37.855
underneath the part of
her that hates everyone.

01:03:37.939 --> 01:03:39.523
Hey!

01:03:39.608 --> 01:03:41.275
And since I heard that
having a girlfriend makes you happy...

01:03:41.359 --> 01:03:43.861
I tried hard to love her like I love Sam.

01:03:43.945 --> 01:03:45.988
Can you believe it's almost
our 2-week anniversary?

01:03:46.072 --> 01:03:48.199
Yeah, I know.

01:03:48.283 --> 01:03:49.783
So I took her on double dates.

01:03:49.868 --> 01:03:52.870
First foreign film.

01:03:52.954 --> 01:03:55.164
Do you want butter on your popcorn?

01:03:55.248 --> 01:03:56.874
Vegans don't eat butter.

01:03:56.958 --> 01:03:59.585
And I tried not to mind
that she loves to hold hands...

01:03:59.669 --> 01:04:01.212
even when her hands are sweaty.

01:04:05.300 --> 01:04:08.552
And I had to admit something
really upsetting, but...

01:04:09.930 --> 01:04:13.557
I'm tired of touching her boobs.

01:04:13.642 --> 01:04:17.061
I thought maybe if she would just let me
pick the make-out music...

01:04:17.145 --> 01:04:20.189
once in a while, we might have a chance.

01:04:20.273 --> 01:04:24.652
And maybe if she didn't put down the books
that Mr. Anderson gives me.

01:04:25.445 --> 01:04:26.862
Walden.

01:04:26.947 --> 01:04:29.156
I read this in 7th grade.

01:04:29.241 --> 01:04:31.784
I would have called it On Boring Pond.

01:04:31.868 --> 01:04:35.913
Or if she would stop calling me the minute
I get home from school...

01:04:35.997 --> 01:04:40.626
when I have absolutely nothing to talk
about other than the bus ride home.

01:04:42.420 --> 01:04:45.005
Somehow she finds new things to say.

01:04:45.090 --> 01:04:46.590
That dairy just sits with you.

01:04:46.675 --> 01:04:48.050
You know, it walks with you.

01:04:48.134 --> 01:04:50.010
She's on the phone right now?

01:04:50.095 --> 01:04:51.720
Charlie, you've gotta break up with her.

01:04:51.805 --> 01:04:53.055
I can do that?

01:04:53.139 --> 01:04:54.932
For Christ's sake, I need to use the phone.

01:04:55.016 --> 01:04:56.559
I got you this book.

01:04:56.643 --> 01:04:57.810
It's really how I became a vegan.

01:04:57.894 --> 01:04:59.436
I know I should have been honest...

01:04:59.521 --> 01:05:02.648
but I was getting so mad,
it was starting to scare me.

01:05:02.732 --> 01:05:04.400
I mean the way they treat those-

01:05:04.484 --> 01:05:07.570
I just wish I could have
found another way to break up.

01:05:07.654 --> 01:05:09.905
Um, Mary Elizabeth, can I talk to you...

01:05:09.990 --> 01:05:12.408
Charlie, please don't interrupt.
You know I hate that.

01:05:12.492 --> 01:05:14.412
In hindsight, I probably
could not have picked...

01:05:14.494 --> 01:05:17.079
a worse way to be honest with
Mary Elizabeth.

01:05:17.163 --> 01:05:18.163
Truth or dare?

01:05:18.248 --> 01:05:19.665
Who are you talking to?

01:05:19.749 --> 01:05:23.502
I dare you to kiss Alice.

01:05:25.422 --> 01:05:28.799
Gird your loins, procreator.

01:05:28.883 --> 01:05:31.343
My God.

01:05:31.428 --> 01:05:34.930
Mary Elizabeth, Samantha told me
that you got into Harvard. Congratulations.

01:05:35.015 --> 01:05:39.351
Thank you. This one still
hasn't gotten me flowers.

01:05:39.436 --> 01:05:40.978
But I forgive you.

01:05:42.647 --> 01:05:45.399
Hey, don't worry about Penn State.
You’re just wait-listed.

01:05:45.483 --> 01:05:47.443
Yeah.

01:05:47.527 --> 01:05:51.238
You guys are about to miss
some severely hot fag-on-goth action.

01:05:55.660 --> 01:05:57.202
Wow.

01:05:58.830 --> 01:05:59.788
Get a room.

01:05:59.873 --> 01:06:01.582
You're a monster.

01:06:01.666 --> 01:06:05.127
My turn. Let's see.

01:06:05.211 --> 01:06:07.421
Let's think. Charlie.

01:06:07.505 --> 01:06:08.380
Truth.

01:06:08.465 --> 01:06:09.905
How's your first relationship going?

01:06:10.884 --> 01:06:12.801
It's so bad...

01:06:12.886 --> 01:06:17.222
that I keep fantasizing
that one of us is dying of cancer.

01:06:17.307 --> 01:06:19.933
So that I don't have to break up with her.

01:06:21.811 --> 01:06:24.647
Charlie? Truth or dare?

01:06:24.731 --> 01:06:25.939
Hello?

01:06:27.692 --> 01:06:29.526
Dare.

01:06:29.611 --> 01:06:33.530
Okay, I dare you
to kiss the prettiest girl in the room...

01:06:33.615 --> 01:06:34.990
on the lips.

01:06:35.075 --> 01:06:37.743
And notice I charitably said
"girl" and not "person"...

01:06:37.827 --> 01:06:40.871
because, let's face it,
I'd smoke all you bitches.

01:06:50.674 --> 01:06:52.424
That's fucked up.

01:06:56.680 --> 01:06:58.430
Mary Elizabeth.

01:06:58.515 --> 01:06:59.932
I'm so sorry.

01:07:01.768 --> 01:07:04.353
It was a mistake, I'm sorry.

01:07:04.437 --> 01:07:06.230
Sam? Sam?

01:07:06.314 --> 01:07:08.857
I really didn't mean anything by it.
I'm sorry.

01:07:09.984 --> 01:07:11.735
What the hell is wrong with you?

01:07:14.197 --> 01:07:15.906
I should go back and apologize.

01:07:15.990 --> 01:07:18.992
Charlie, trust me,
you don't wanna go back in there.

01:07:19.077 --> 01:07:22.204
I'm really sorry.
I didn't mean to do anything.

01:07:22.288 --> 01:07:23.622
I know you didn't.

01:07:24.249 --> 01:07:26.083
But, look-

01:07:28.586 --> 01:07:30.629
I hate to be the one to break this...

01:07:30.714 --> 01:07:34.758
but there's history with
Mary Elizabeth and Sam.

01:07:34.843 --> 01:07:38.137
Other guys and things that have
nothing to do with you.

01:07:38.221 --> 01:07:41.974
It's best if you just stay away for a while.

01:07:43.977 --> 01:07:45.436
Okay.

01:07:50.066 --> 01:07:51.483
How long do you think?

01:08:20.138 --> 01:08:22.096
Charlie.

01:08:22.182 --> 01:08:24.390
Come on, get dressed.
You're gonna be late for Easter Mass.

01:08:24.475 --> 01:08:26.018
I'll be there in a minute.

01:08:30.273 --> 01:08:34.609
Our Father,
who art in heaven, hallowed be Thy name.

01:08:34.694 --> 01:08:39.198
Thy kingdom come, Thy will be
done on earth as it is in heaven.

01:08:39.282 --> 01:08:41.325
Give us this day our daily bread...

01:08:41.408 --> 01:08:43.327
and forgive us our trespasses...

01:08:43.411 --> 01:08:46.037
as we forgive those who
trespass against us.

01:08:50.167 --> 01:08:52.920
And lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us...

01:08:53.004 --> 01:08:57.466
Mary Elizabeth, I've been listening
to the Billie Holiday CD every night.

01:08:57.550 --> 01:08:58.926
It's too late, Charlie.

01:08:59.010 --> 01:09:02.136
I know.
I just feel really bad about what I did.

01:09:02.221 --> 01:09:05.098
I just get so messed up inside.

01:09:05.183 --> 01:09:06.892
Like I'm not there or something.

01:09:06.975 --> 01:09:09.353
Tell it to someone who cares.
Look, I know. I'm sorry.

01:09:09.437 --> 01:09:11.063
Just we've all become such good friends.

01:09:11.147 --> 01:09:13.106
Good friends?

01:09:13.191 --> 01:09:15.067
Do you mean the people
that I've known since kindergarten...

01:09:15.151 --> 01:09:16.984
and you've known for six months?

01:09:17.069 --> 01:09:18.612
Those good friends?

01:09:18.696 --> 01:09:21.031
Yeah, I mean, I just don't wanna do
anything to ruin our relationship.

01:09:21.115 --> 01:09:22.741
It's ruined. Okay?

01:09:22.826 --> 01:09:25.993
So stop calling everyone.
Stop embarrassing yourself.

01:09:26.078 --> 01:09:29.372
Okay, I will. Good...

01:09:33.670 --> 01:09:37.046
- Something's wrong with me.
- Don't worry about it.

01:09:39.341 --> 01:09:41.885
Hey, have you heard from Patrick?

01:09:41.970 --> 01:09:44.595
No, he told me to stay away.

01:09:44.680 --> 01:09:47.390
You don't know.

01:09:47.475 --> 01:09:49.725
Why? Why? What happened?

01:09:49.810 --> 01:09:52.104
Brad's father caught them together.

01:09:56.192 --> 01:09:58.277
Some kids jumped him outside the O.

01:09:58.361 --> 01:10:00.904
No, it was some kids from North Hills.

01:10:00.989 --> 01:10:03.407
Did you see his face?

01:10:03.491 --> 01:10:04.908
That's not what I heard.

01:10:06.995 --> 01:10:08.495
Are you okay?

01:10:08.580 --> 01:10:11.373
Not now, Charlie. I'm sorry.

01:10:20.091 --> 01:10:21.300
Hey, Nothing.

01:10:29.183 --> 01:10:32.311
Oops. Sorry, Nothing.

01:10:43.573 --> 01:10:45.073
You gonna do anything?

01:10:45.158 --> 01:10:46.450
What are you talking about?

01:10:46.534 --> 01:10:48.660
I'm talking about
your pet ape just tripped me.

01:10:48.745 --> 01:10:49.828
Gonna say something?

01:10:51.623 --> 01:10:53.540
- Why would I?
- You know why.

01:10:53.625 --> 01:10:57.419
This is pathetic, man. Your fixation on me.

01:10:57.503 --> 01:10:59.588
Do you want your friends
to know how you got those bruises? Really?

01:10:59.672 --> 01:11:01.465
I got jumped in a parking lot.

01:11:01.549 --> 01:11:03.258
Where? Schenley Park?

01:11:03.343 --> 01:11:05.469
Do you guys know about Schenley Park?

01:11:05.553 --> 01:11:07.387
- Do your friends know—
- I don't know what kinda sick shit...

01:11:07.472 --> 01:11:11.224
you're trying to pull,
but you better walk away right now.

01:11:12.268 --> 01:11:13.685
Nothing.

01:11:13.770 --> 01:11:15.187
Fine.

01:11:16.648 --> 01:11:18.523
Say hi to your dad for me.

01:11:21.861 --> 01:11:24.738
Whatever, faggot.

01:11:27.075 --> 01:11:29.276
- What did you just call me?
- Just called you a faggot.

01:11:43.883 --> 01:11:46.885
Say that shit again! Say that shit again!

01:11:46.970 --> 01:11:48.220
It's Patrick!

01:11:49.222 --> 01:11:50.681
Leave him alone!

01:11:50.765 --> 01:11:52.057
Sam!

01:12:00.066 --> 01:12:02.776
Stop! Leave him! Stop!

01:12:03.569 --> 01:12:04.903
Stop!

01:12:37.729 --> 01:12:40.230
Touch my friends again and I'll blind you.

01:12:50.199 --> 01:12:51.700
Charlie?

01:12:51.784 --> 01:12:52.868
Yeah?

01:12:54.120 --> 01:12:55.454
Thanks for stopping 'em.

01:12:57.999 --> 01:12:59.332
Sure, Brad.

01:13:21.439 --> 01:13:22.814
How you doing, Charlie?

01:13:22.899 --> 01:13:24.900
I don't know.

01:13:24.984 --> 01:13:28.111
I keep trying, but I can't
really remember what I did.

01:13:29.197 --> 01:13:30.697
Do you want me to tell you?

01:13:32.450 --> 01:13:33.784
Yeah.

01:13:33.868 --> 01:13:35.744
You saved my brother.

01:13:36.954 --> 01:13:38.163
That's what you did.

01:13:39.248 --> 01:13:40.582
So you're not scared of me?

01:13:40.666 --> 01:13:41.792
No.

01:13:44.587 --> 01:13:45.754
Can we be friends again?

01:13:45.838 --> 01:13:47.798
Of course.

01:13:55.389 --> 01:13:56.515
Come on.

01:13:59.644 --> 01:14:01.478
Let's go be psychos together.

01:14:07.485 --> 01:14:08.902
I'm dating Peter now.

01:14:10.530 --> 01:14:11.988
He's in college with Craig.

01:14:12.073 --> 01:14:15.826
He's opinionated. We have
intellectual debates.

01:14:15.910 --> 01:14:19.996
You were very sweet
but our relationship was too one-sided.

01:14:20.081 --> 01:14:22.833
I know this is hard for you.

01:14:22.917 --> 01:14:24.376
I'm just glad that you're happy.

01:14:25.128 --> 01:14:26.378
Okay.

01:14:31.259 --> 01:14:34.261
Hey, Craig, Sam will be down. Soon.

01:14:34.345 --> 01:14:36.847
Oy vey. We're gonna miss the movie.

01:14:36.931 --> 01:14:39.391
Yeah, I'll go put some pep in her step.
Don't worry.

01:14:39.475 --> 01:14:40.517
Hello?

01:14:42.728 --> 01:14:45.730
Hey. Do you wanna get out of here?

01:14:45.815 --> 01:14:47.107
Sure, Patrick.

01:14:50.236 --> 01:14:51.486
I'll tell you something, Charlie...

01:14:51.571 --> 01:14:53.446
I feel good. You know what I mean?

01:14:53.531 --> 01:14:56.700
Maybe tomorrow I'll take you
to this karaoke place downtown.

01:14:56.784 --> 01:14:59.161
And this club off the Strip.
They don't card.

01:14:59.245 --> 01:15:01.246
And the Schenley Park scene.

01:15:01.330 --> 01:15:04.416
You have to see the Fruit Loop
at least one time.

01:15:16.179 --> 01:15:20.348
My God. My life is officially
an after-school special.

01:15:20.433 --> 01:15:21.892
Son of a bitch!

01:15:22.685 --> 01:15:24.352
It really is.

01:15:24.437 --> 01:15:26.271
It so is.

01:15:29.859 --> 01:15:32.819
So, you ever hear the
one about Lily Miller?

01:15:32.904 --> 01:15:34.196
I don't know.

01:15:34.280 --> 01:15:35.780
Really?

01:15:35.865 --> 01:15:38.325
I thought your brother would have told you.
It's a classic.

01:15:38.409 --> 01:15:40.076
Maybe.

01:15:40.161 --> 01:15:42.996
Okay, Lily comes here
one night with this guy Parker.

01:15:43.080 --> 01:15:46.917
And this was to be the night
that they were gonna lose their virginity.

01:15:47.001 --> 01:15:49.544
So she did it really proper.
She packed a picnic.

01:15:49.629 --> 01:15:51.880
Stole a bottle of wine.

01:15:51.964 --> 01:15:56.635
Everything was perfect
and they’re just about to "do it."

01:15:56.719 --> 01:15:59.262
When they realize they forgot the condoms.

01:15:59.347 --> 01:16:02.515
- So what do you think happened?
- I don't know.

01:16:02.600 --> 01:16:04.309
They did it with one of the sandwich bags.

01:16:05.102 --> 01:16:06.269
Ew!

01:16:08.356 --> 01:16:09.940
That's disgusting!

01:16:10.024 --> 01:16:11.566
Yes, it is.

01:16:11.651 --> 01:16:13.985
Come on! Let's keep the train rolling.

01:16:14.070 --> 01:16:16.321
Suburban legend, Charlie.

01:16:16.405 --> 01:16:17.989
Well...

01:16:18.074 --> 01:16:21.076
There's this girl named Second Base Stace.

01:16:21.160 --> 01:16:24.829
And, well, she had boobs in 4th grade.

01:16:24.914 --> 01:16:27.082
Mosquito bites. Promising. Go.

01:16:27.166 --> 01:16:30.669
And she let some of the guys feel them.

01:16:32.046 --> 01:16:34.506
- That's your suburban legend?
- Yeah.

01:16:34.590 --> 01:16:37.008
- Did you at least cop a feel?
- No.

01:16:37.093 --> 01:16:39.719
No. Of course not. You went home...

01:16:39.804 --> 01:16:42.514
listened to "Asleep," wrote a poem...

01:16:42.598 --> 01:16:44.641
Fine. Okay. Your turn.

01:16:50.356 --> 01:16:51.564
Yeah. I've got one.

01:16:53.859 --> 01:16:55.318
Well...

01:16:55.403 --> 01:16:57.237
there's this one guy.

01:16:57.321 --> 01:17:00.073
Queer as a 3-dollar bill.

01:17:00.157 --> 01:17:04.035
The guy's father doesn't
know about his son.

01:17:04.120 --> 01:17:09.374
So he comes into the basement one night
when he's supposed to be out of town.

01:17:09.458 --> 01:17:11.584
Catches his son with another boy.

01:17:13.087 --> 01:17:14.796
So he starts beating him.

01:17:14.880 --> 01:17:18.883
But not like the slap kind.
Like, the real kind.

01:17:22.054 --> 01:17:26.725
And the boyfriend says,
"Stop. You're killing him."

01:17:28.019 --> 01:17:30.603
But the son just yells, "Get out."

01:17:31.981 --> 01:17:35.108
And eventually...

01:17:36.527 --> 01:17:39.571
the boyfriend just did.

01:17:46.245 --> 01:17:48.371
Why can't you save anybody?

01:17:50.666 --> 01:17:52.125
I don't know.

01:17:54.462 --> 01:17:55.754
Forget it.

01:17:56.797 --> 01:17:58.840
I'm free now, right?

01:17:58.924 --> 01:18:02.927
I could meet
the love of my life any second.

01:18:03.012 --> 01:18:06.556
Things will be different
now and that's good.

01:18:06.640 --> 01:18:08.933
I just need to meet a good guy.

01:18:09.852 --> 01:18:10.977
Yeah.

01:18:24.533 --> 01:18:26.034
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

01:18:27.953 --> 01:18:29.162
It's all right.

01:18:33.876 --> 01:18:37.295
I've been spending a lot
of time with Patrick.

01:18:37.380 --> 01:18:40.673
He begins every night really excited.

01:18:40.758 --> 01:18:44.761
He always says he feels free
and tonight is his destiny.

01:18:44.845 --> 01:18:48.515
But after a while he runs out of things
to keep himself numb.

01:18:50.935 --> 01:18:53.812
And Sam got her letter from Penn State.

01:19:00.194 --> 01:19:02.445
"We will require you to take
our summer session...

01:19:02.530 --> 01:19:06.199
at the main campus immediately following
your high school graduation."

01:19:09.412 --> 01:19:10.662
She got in, Charlie.

01:19:22.550 --> 01:19:27.429
After that, all Patrick could talk about
was college and all their futures.

01:19:27.513 --> 01:19:30.014
Alice did get into NYU film school.

01:19:30.099 --> 01:19:32.225
Patrick is going to the
University of Washington...

01:19:32.309 --> 01:19:35.979
because he wants to be
near the music in Seattle.

01:19:36.063 --> 01:19:41.067
But he wasn't going to leave without
organizing the best senior prank ever.

01:19:47.616 --> 01:19:50.034
Sam is going away right after graduation.

01:19:50.119 --> 01:19:52.287
It all feels very exciting.

01:19:52.371 --> 01:19:54.914
I just wish it were happening to me.

01:19:54.999 --> 01:19:59.127
Especially because, ever since I
blacked out in the cafeteria...

01:19:59.211 --> 01:20:00.795
it's been getting worse.

01:20:00.880 --> 01:20:03.965
And I can't turn it off this time.

01:20:04.049 --> 01:20:08.094
All right, guys, you wanna pass your
copies of Gatsby up to the front, please.

01:20:08.179 --> 01:20:10.096
And I know it's the last day...

01:20:10.181 --> 01:20:13.933
but if we could keep it to a dull roar,
I'd appreciate it.

01:20:14.018 --> 01:20:15.018
Thank you.

01:20:15.102 --> 01:20:18.605
Guy. Guys. Thank you for such a great year.

01:20:18.689 --> 01:20:20.565
I had a blast. I hope you did, too.

01:20:20.649 --> 01:20:23.526
And I hope you have
a great time this summer on your vacations.

01:20:23.611 --> 01:20:25.904
Now who here is gonna read
for pleasure this summer?

01:20:31.452 --> 01:20:32.702
Charlie.

01:20:32.786 --> 01:20:33.786
Very good.

01:20:37.833 --> 01:20:39.167
Have a good summer.

01:20:43.881 --> 01:20:45.465
Last day.

01:20:45.549 --> 01:20:47.467
Yeah.

01:20:47.551 --> 01:20:51.429
So I know it's none of my business,
but have you decided?

01:20:52.348 --> 01:20:54.432
Are you going to New York?

01:20:55.476 --> 01:20:56.559
Well...

01:20:57.645 --> 01:21:00.480
My wife and I like it here.

01:21:00.564 --> 01:21:02.815
And I think I might be better
at teaching than writing.

01:21:04.109 --> 01:21:06.694
You know, Charlie, I was thinking that...

01:21:08.239 --> 01:21:10.156
maybe I could still give
you books next year.

01:21:10.241 --> 01:21:12.742
Yeah. Yeah.

01:21:12.826 --> 01:21:15.161
I think you could write one of them one day.

01:21:16.372 --> 01:21:18.915
- Really?
- I do.

01:21:21.710 --> 01:21:23.461
You're the best teacher I've ever had.

01:21:24.380 --> 01:21:25.797
Thank you.

01:21:35.474 --> 01:21:38.059
10, nine, eight...

01:21:38.143 --> 01:21:40.270
seven, six, five...

01:21:40.354 --> 01:21:42.939
four, three, two, one.

01:21:50.990 --> 01:21:52.532
Dear friend...

01:21:52.616 --> 01:21:55.159
I wanted to tell you about us running.

01:21:55.244 --> 01:21:57.036
There was this beautiful sunset.

01:21:57.121 --> 01:21:59.455
And just a few hours
before, everyone I love...

01:21:59.540 --> 01:22:02.166
had their last day of high school ever.

01:22:02.251 --> 01:22:04.210
I was happy because they were happy...

01:22:04.295 --> 01:22:06.629
even though I counted and I have...

01:22:06.714 --> 01:22:10.925
1,095 days to go.

01:22:11.010 --> 01:22:13.428
I kept imagining
what school would be like without them...

01:22:13.512 --> 01:22:16.180
as they were all getting ready
for their prom.

01:22:16.265 --> 01:22:19.642
My sister finally decided
to break up with Derek...

01:22:19.727 --> 01:22:22.145
and go stag with her girlfriends instead.

01:22:24.398 --> 01:22:26.649
And then there was Sam.

01:22:26.734 --> 01:22:30.069
I've looked at her picture
since that night.

01:22:30.154 --> 01:22:33.489
I like to see how happy she was
before she knew.

01:22:33.574 --> 01:22:37.452
They were in a hotel suite after prom
and the truth came out.

01:22:37.536 --> 01:22:41.456
Basically Craig
has been cheating on Sam the whole time.

01:22:41.540 --> 01:22:43.291
When I heard that...

01:22:43.375 --> 01:22:45.960
I kept thinking about the happy girl
in these pictures.

01:22:46.045 --> 01:22:49.839
'Cause she doesn't have 1,095 days to go.

01:22:49.923 --> 01:22:51.841
She made it.

01:22:51.925 --> 01:22:54.135
This is her time.

01:22:54.219 --> 01:22:57.013
And no one should be
able to take that away.

01:22:59.266 --> 01:23:00.767
Congratulations.

01:23:00.851 --> 01:23:02.769
Charlie. Charlie's here. Guys, group photo.

01:23:02.853 --> 01:23:04.312
We should all take a group photo.

01:23:04.396 --> 01:23:06.397
Ooh! Get against the railing
and try to look suave.

01:23:06.482 --> 01:23:08.941
Yep, this is the one.
That's gonna be a great angle.

01:23:16.950 --> 01:23:18.826
At her going away party...

01:23:18.911 --> 01:23:22.163
I wanted her to know about that night
we went through the tunnel.

01:23:22.247 --> 01:23:24.165
And how for the first time...

01:23:24.249 --> 01:23:26.292
I felt like I belonged somewhere.

01:23:27.961 --> 01:23:30.630
And tomorrow, she's leaving.

01:23:30.714 --> 01:23:33.424
So I wanted to give her a part of me.

01:23:35.761 --> 01:23:38.221
Are these all your books, Charlie?

01:23:47.606 --> 01:23:49.023
Thanks for staying up with me.

01:23:49.108 --> 01:23:51.734
Sure.

01:23:51.819 --> 01:23:56.781
My brother said Penn State has this
restaurant called Ye Olde College Diner.

01:23:56.865 --> 01:23:59.075
You have to get a grilled
sticky on your first night.

01:23:59.159 --> 01:24:01.494
It's a tradition.

01:24:02.287 --> 01:24:03.621
That sounds like fun.

01:24:03.706 --> 01:24:04.789
Yeah.

01:24:07.459 --> 01:24:10.169
Pretty soon, you'll have
a whole new group of friends, you know.

01:24:11.505 --> 01:24:13.798
You won't even think about
this place anymore.

01:24:16.343 --> 01:24:17.677
Yes, I will.

01:24:31.150 --> 01:24:32.817
Had lunch with Craig today.

01:24:34.820 --> 01:24:36.571
Yeah?

01:24:36.655 --> 01:24:39.657
He said he was sorry and that I was right
to break up with him.

01:24:41.910 --> 01:24:46.748
I'm driving away
and was feeling so small.

01:24:46.832 --> 01:24:52.754
Just asking myself,
"Why do I and everyone I love...

01:24:52.838 --> 01:24:55.965
pick people who treat
us like we're nothing?"

01:25:00.721 --> 01:25:03.514
We accept the love we think we deserve.

01:25:10.022 --> 01:25:12.356
Then why didn't you ever ask me out?

01:25:19.364 --> 01:25:20.907
I, um...

01:25:20.991 --> 01:25:23.367
I just didn't think that you wanted that.

01:25:24.119 --> 01:25:26.204
Well, what did you want?

01:25:27.539 --> 01:25:29.874
I just want you to be happy.

01:25:30.876 --> 01:25:32.794
Don't you get it, Charlie?

01:25:33.837 --> 01:25:36.380
I can't feel that.

01:25:36.465 --> 01:25:39.634
It's really sweet and everything, but...

01:25:39.718 --> 01:25:42.470
You can’t just sit there
and put everybody's lives ahead of yours...

01:25:42.554 --> 01:25:44.222
and think that counts as love.

01:25:44.306 --> 01:25:47.350
I don't want to be somebody's crush.

01:25:47.434 --> 01:25:51.312
I want people to like the real me.

01:25:54.483 --> 01:25:56.859
I know who you are, Sam.

01:26:02.407 --> 01:26:04.242
I know I'm quiet.

01:26:05.494 --> 01:26:08.371
And I know I should speak more.

01:26:08.455 --> 01:26:12.333
But if you knew the things
that were in my head most of the time...

01:26:12.417 --> 01:26:15.628
you'd know what it really meant.

01:26:17.506 --> 01:26:20.424
How much we're alike...

01:26:20.509 --> 01:26:22.969
and how we've been through the same things.

01:26:24.596 --> 01:26:26.848
And you're not small.

01:26:26.932 --> 01:26:28.266
You're beautiful.

01:26:55.002 --> 01:26:56.127
What's wrong, Charlie?

01:26:56.670 --> 01:26:57.962
Nothing.

01:27:26.700 --> 01:27:28.159
You know I'm gonna call you all the time.

01:27:28.243 --> 01:27:30.620
- We're gonna see each other in New York.
- All the time.

01:27:33.582 --> 01:27:34.832
Come on, Sam.

01:28:17.209 --> 01:28:18.751
What's wrong, Charlie?

01:28:22.214 --> 01:28:23.673
Put your seat belt on.

01:28:23.757 --> 01:28:24.882
We'll meet you there.

01:28:48.615 --> 01:28:50.241
Don't wake your sister.

01:29:03.005 --> 01:29:04.755
It'll be our little secret, okay?

01:29:07.175 --> 01:29:10.636
Look, Charlie, she's fast asleep.

01:29:12.556 --> 01:29:13.639
Don't wake your sister.

01:29:20.981 --> 01:29:25.359
My fault.

01:29:26.028 --> 01:29:27.611
It's all my fault.

01:29:27.696 --> 01:29:29.530
It'll be our little secret. Okay?

01:29:29.614 --> 01:29:30.781
Stop it.

01:29:31.950 --> 01:29:33.117
Stop.

01:29:37.205 --> 01:29:41.333
Stop crying.

01:29:48.383 --> 01:29:49.800
This'll be our little secret.

01:29:56.558 --> 01:29:58.684
Candace. Your brother's on the phone.

01:30:01.313 --> 01:30:02.563
Hello?

01:30:02.647 --> 01:30:04.899
- Hey, Candace.
- Charlie?

01:30:04.983 --> 01:30:09.570
Sam and Patrick left,
and I can't stop thinking about something.

01:30:09.654 --> 01:30:10.821
Shh. What?

01:30:10.906 --> 01:30:12.156
Candace...

01:30:13.200 --> 01:30:15.785
I killed Aunt Helen, didn't I?

01:30:15.869 --> 01:30:17.620
She died getting my birthday present...

01:30:17.704 --> 01:30:20.748
so I guess I killed her, right?

01:30:20.832 --> 01:30:22.917
I've tried to stop thinking that,
but I can't.

01:30:23.001 --> 01:30:24.668
She keeps driving away and dying.

01:30:24.753 --> 01:30:26.295
Call the police and send them to my house.

01:30:26.379 --> 01:30:28.130
I can't stop her. I'm crazy again.

01:30:28.215 --> 01:30:29.799
No. Charlie, listen to me.

01:30:29.883 --> 01:30:31.926
Mom and Dad are gonna be home
with Chris any second.

01:30:32.010 --> 01:30:34.303
I’m just thinking...

01:30:34.387 --> 01:30:36.597
what if I wanted her to die, Candace?

01:30:36.681 --> 01:30:38.849
What? Charlie?

01:30:38.934 --> 01:30:40.059
Charlie!

01:31:15.137 --> 01:31:16.428
Charlie?

01:31:17.514 --> 01:31:19.056
I'm Dr. Burton.

01:31:23.770 --> 01:31:25.271
Where am I?

01:31:25.355 --> 01:31:27.523
Mayview Hospital.

01:31:29.484 --> 01:31:34.071
You, — You have to let me go.
My dad can't afford it.

01:31:34.156 --> 01:31:36.157
Don't worry about that.

01:31:36.241 --> 01:31:41.162
No. I saw them when I was little...

01:31:41.246 --> 01:31:43.497
and I don't want to be a Mayview kid.

01:31:43.582 --> 01:31:45.374
Just tell me how to stop it.

01:31:45.458 --> 01:31:46.792
Stop what?

01:31:47.586 --> 01:31:49.461
Seeing it.

01:31:52.007 --> 01:31:56.093
All their lives all the time.

01:31:57.137 --> 01:31:59.096
How do you stop seeing it?

01:31:59.181 --> 01:32:01.056
Seeing what, Charlie?

01:32:01.141 --> 01:32:06.729
There is so much pain.

01:32:06.813 --> 01:32:11.442
And I don't know how to not notice it.

01:32:11.526 --> 01:32:13.360
What's hurting you?

01:32:13.445 --> 01:32:14.737
No, not me.

01:32:14.821 --> 01:32:19.366
It's them. It's everyone. It never stops.

01:32:20.493 --> 01:32:21.660
Do you understand?

01:32:28.627 --> 01:32:30.669
What about your Aunt Helen?

01:32:34.633 --> 01:32:36.967
What about her?

01:32:37.052 --> 01:32:38.594
Do you see her?

01:32:41.848 --> 01:32:43.974
Yes.

01:32:44.059 --> 01:32:46.060
She had a terrible life.

01:32:48.980 --> 01:32:50.140
God, what am I supposed to...

01:32:50.148 --> 01:32:53.317
You said some things
about her in your sleep.

01:32:53.401 --> 01:32:55.236
I don't care.

01:32:55.320 --> 01:32:56.820
If you want to get better...

01:32:57.989 --> 01:32:59.657
you have to.

01:33:06.414 --> 01:33:07.414
She...

01:33:08.917 --> 01:33:11.335
She was insane.

01:33:12.170 --> 01:33:13.545
I'm just sayin'.

01:33:14.547 --> 01:33:15.839
She...

01:33:17.342 --> 01:33:18.759
Charlie?

01:33:18.843 --> 01:33:21.178
You gonna let me help you here?

01:33:24.224 --> 01:33:25.432
Okay.

01:33:26.726 --> 01:33:29.520
Do you remember anything
before you blacked out?

01:33:32.190 --> 01:33:34.984
I remember leaving Sam's house.

01:33:35.777 --> 01:33:38.862
I was walking home. And...

01:33:40.448 --> 01:33:42.616
I was in the hospital for a while.

01:33:44.411 --> 01:33:47.663
I won't go into detail about all of it.

01:33:47.747 --> 01:33:51.959
But I will say there
were some very bad days.

01:33:52.043 --> 01:33:54.712
And some unexpected beautiful days.

01:33:57.716 --> 01:34:01.385
The worst day was the time my doctor
told my mom and dad...

01:34:01.469 --> 01:34:03.387
what Aunt Helen did to me.

01:34:10.228 --> 01:34:11.270
Honey?

01:34:14.065 --> 01:34:15.733
I'm so sorry.

01:34:29.914 --> 01:34:32.833
The best days were those
when I could have visitors.

01:34:32.917 --> 01:34:35.377
My brother and sister
always came for those...

01:34:35.462 --> 01:34:38.547
until Chris had to go to training camp.

01:34:38.631 --> 01:34:40.758
He's going to be first string this year.

01:34:42.886 --> 01:34:46.805
My sister told me she met a nice guy
at her summer job.

01:34:50.810 --> 01:34:53.270
Here he is.

01:34:53.355 --> 01:34:57.191
So I'll see you Thursday at 6:00, right?

01:34:57.275 --> 01:34:59.276
- Okay.
- You gonna hang in there?

01:34:59.361 --> 01:35:02.196
My doctor said we can't choose
where we come from...

01:35:02.280 --> 01:35:04.782
but we can choose where we go from there.

01:35:05.992 --> 01:35:07.576
I know it's not all the answers...

01:35:07.660 --> 01:35:11.372
but it was enough to start putting
these pieces together.

01:35:12.624 --> 01:35:14.384
God bless this food we
are about to receive.

01:35:14.459 --> 01:35:15.876
We thank you for this bounty...

01:35:15.960 --> 01:35:18.253
in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, Amen.

01:35:18.338 --> 01:35:20.339
- Amen.
- Amen.

01:35:28.556 --> 01:35:31.183
How do you think the Penguins
are gonna do this year, Dad?

01:35:33.561 --> 01:35:35.229
Goddamn Penguins.

01:35:35.313 --> 01:35:37.523
Think they're allergic to goddamn defense.

01:35:40.985 --> 01:35:43.195
What do the players call a puck again?

01:35:43.863 --> 01:35:45.489
A biscuit.

01:35:45.573 --> 01:35:47.574
Are you sure it's not a "goddamn biscuit"?

01:35:47.659 --> 01:35:49.118
You're cruisin' for a bruisin'.

01:35:49.202 --> 01:35:50.994
Honey, I think we're gonna have to do...

01:35:51.079 --> 01:35:52.746
a little shopping for you
before you take off?

01:35:52.831 --> 01:35:55.582
- Yeah, I need some books.
- Clothes, too.

01:35:55.667 --> 01:35:56.834
Yeah.

01:36:02.424 --> 01:36:04.174
Can Charlie come out and play?

01:36:10.223 --> 01:36:12.599
The first night, we had grilled stickies.

01:36:12.684 --> 01:36:14.059
So good.

01:36:14.144 --> 01:36:15.936
You have to visit in the fall.
We'll have some, okay?

01:36:16.020 --> 01:36:17.104
Definitely.

01:36:17.188 --> 01:36:18.647
Sorry...

01:36:18.731 --> 01:36:21.233
Charlie has a breakdown
scheduled for October.

01:36:22.652 --> 01:36:24.695
Well, can I tell you something?

01:36:24.779 --> 01:36:27.030
I've been away for two months.

01:36:27.740 --> 01:36:29.199
It's another world.

01:36:29.284 --> 01:36:31.285
And it gets better.

01:36:31.369 --> 01:36:34.455
And my roommate Katie
has the best taste in music.

01:36:40.920 --> 01:36:42.713
I found the tunnel song.

01:36:46.050 --> 01:36:47.050
Let's drive.

01:36:51.806 --> 01:36:54.516
I don't know if I will have the time
to write any more letters...

01:36:54.601 --> 01:36:57.728
because I might be too busy
trying to participate.

01:37:01.107 --> 01:37:03.484
So, if this does end up
being the last letter...

01:37:03.568 --> 01:37:07.654
I want you to know that I was in a bad
place before I started high school.

01:37:07.739 --> 01:37:10.157
And you helped me.

01:37:10.241 --> 01:37:12.493
Even if you didn't know
what I was talking about...

01:37:12.577 --> 01:37:14.828
or know someone who's gone through it.

01:37:14.913 --> 01:37:16.747
You made me not feel alone.

01:37:19.417 --> 01:37:23.837
Because I know there are people
who say all these things don't happen.

01:37:23.922 --> 01:37:29.510
There are people who forget what it's like
to be 16 when they turn 17.

01:37:29.594 --> 01:37:32.221
I know these will all be stories someday.

01:37:32.305 --> 01:37:35.265
And our pictures will
become old photographs.

01:37:35.350 --> 01:37:37.851
And we'll all become somebody's mom or dad.

01:37:39.604 --> 01:37:43.398
But right now these moments
are not stories.

01:37:43.483 --> 01:37:44.858
This is happening.

01:37:45.860 --> 01:37:47.361
I am here.

01:37:47.445 --> 01:37:49.029
And I am looking at her.

01:37:49.948 --> 01:37:52.282
And she is so beautiful.

01:38:02.293 --> 01:38:04.044
I can see it.

01:38:04.128 --> 01:38:07.631
This one moment when you know
you're not a sad story.

01:38:08.550 --> 01:38:11.134
You are alive.

01:38:11.219 --> 01:38:13.887
You stand up and see the lights
on the buildings...

01:38:13.972 --> 01:38:17.099
and everything that makes you wonder.

01:38:17.183 --> 01:38:19.434
And you're listening
to that song on that drive...

01:38:19.519 --> 01:38:22.563
with the people you love
most in this world.

01:38:25.358 --> 01:38:28.110
And in this moment, I swear...

01:38:29.988 --> 01:38:31.780
we are infinite.
