00:07.931 --> 00:10.848
( theme music playing )

00:33.473 --> 00:35.431
( thunder rumbling )

00:40.515 --> 00:42.682
( thunder crashes )

00:42.682 --> 00:44.014
( lock beeps )

01:30.682 --> 01:33.889
( whispering indistinctly )

01:39.640 --> 01:41.931
( knock on door )

01:49.682 --> 01:52.557
- Samuel?
- Yes, dear.

01:52.557 --> 01:54.223
What a mess, my God.

01:54.223 --> 01:55.765
No fun driving
in it either.

01:55.765 --> 01:57.431
No, it is not.

02:01.223 --> 02:03.889
You know, you look
like your photos.

02:03.889 --> 02:05.931
How nice to finally
meet you.

02:05.931 --> 02:08.931
You, too.
You, too.

02:08.931 --> 02:11.181
Would you like a drink?

02:11.181 --> 02:13.515
No, thanks.
I'm good, actually.

02:13.515 --> 02:15.098
Okay.

02:15.098 --> 02:16.807
Well, I'm gonna
have another.

02:21.306 --> 02:25.014
I'm not gonna lie, Samuel,
it's kind of like

02:25.014 --> 02:29.139
I sort of feel like
a celebrity is in the room.

02:29.139 --> 02:31.223
Ah, it ain't all that.

02:31.223 --> 02:32.973
No, I know.
It's just...

02:34.223 --> 02:36.807
we've been corresponding
so long.

02:36.807 --> 02:38.765
A lot of folks
feel that way.

02:38.765 --> 02:40.431
It's not unusual
to feel that way.

02:42.139 --> 02:43.931
You mind if I go change?

02:43.931 --> 02:45.139
No, please do.

02:45.139 --> 02:47.223
And in the meantime,
put this on.

02:48.973 --> 02:50.723
Samuel:
Damn it!

02:50.723 --> 02:52.557
Should have known
a place like this
wouldn't have a DVD player.

02:52.557 --> 02:54.973
- Shit!
- Oh, it's okay.

02:54.973 --> 02:56.640
I've already seen them.

02:56.640 --> 03:01.098
All 11 of them,
and I've watched them a lot.

03:01.098 --> 03:04.181
Well, I have a whole different
set of tapes for tonight.

03:05.348 --> 03:08.390
Tapes you've
never seen before.

03:08.390 --> 03:10.682
Why don't you call
the front desk

03:10.682 --> 03:14.640
and see if we can get
a DVD player going
while I go change?

03:14.640 --> 03:15.598
Good idea.

03:21.889 --> 03:23.306
( door closes )

03:29.973 --> 03:31.348
Hello?

03:31.348 --> 03:36.889
Yes, can I get a DVD player
in room 104?

03:36.889 --> 03:38.265
Thank you.

03:40.723 --> 03:42.014
( door opens )

03:47.723 --> 03:49.515
Are you okay?

03:49.515 --> 03:53.889
Yeah, she says she'll be here
in two minutes.

03:53.889 --> 03:55.390
Good.

03:56.473 --> 03:58.181
In the meantime...

03:58.181 --> 04:00.931
Oh. What's this?

04:00.931 --> 04:03.223
It's important that neither
practitioner or participant

04:03.223 --> 04:05.306
be wearing
any synthetic fibers.

04:05.306 --> 04:08.348
Of course.
That makes sense.

04:08.348 --> 04:10.973
And just...

04:10.973 --> 04:14.223
make sure you're not
wearing any, uh...

04:14.223 --> 04:16.931
elastics or plastics
on your undergarments.

04:19.723 --> 04:21.014
Thank you.

04:21.014 --> 04:23.098
Of course.
Of course.

04:24.931 --> 04:26.139
( door closes )

04:38.973 --> 04:40.557
Everything okay?

04:40.557 --> 04:42.056
Fine.

04:42.056 --> 04:43.515
Fine.
Out in a minute.

04:44.765 --> 04:46.640
( toilet flushes )

04:49.931 --> 04:52.515
So, how long are you
gonna be here in town?

04:52.515 --> 04:54.431
Hitting the road
after this.

04:54.431 --> 04:57.348
- Only came to see you.
- You did?

04:57.348 --> 04:59.098
Sooner or later,
I get recognized,

04:59.098 --> 05:01.765
so I can't stay
in the same place
for too long.

05:01.765 --> 05:04.139
Sure, sure.

05:04.139 --> 05:06.473
( knock on door )

05:07.848 --> 05:09.682
Wait.

05:09.682 --> 05:11.557
My sacred robes.

05:20.139 --> 05:21.931
( thunder rumbles )

05:21.931 --> 05:23.973
- You called about
a DVD player?
- Yes.

05:28.807 --> 05:30.682
- ( music playing )
- Here we go.

05:33.473 --> 05:35.473
If you're watching
this tape,

05:35.473 --> 05:38.931
if you've arrived here,
congratulations.

05:38.931 --> 05:43.348
We are kindred spirits
on this plane!

05:43.348 --> 05:47.640
You are gazing into the eyes
of your father.

05:47.640 --> 05:51.431
And I am gazing
into the eyes of my child.

05:51.431 --> 05:55.390
Here you sit
at a crossroads.

05:55.390 --> 05:58.973
To your left lies a door.

05:58.973 --> 06:02.014
Beyond it lies
something wonderful,

06:02.014 --> 06:05.181
but something also...
challenging.

06:05.181 --> 06:06.765
It's what you've been
working towards

06:06.765 --> 06:09.598
since you first began
our program.

06:09.598 --> 06:14.265
To the right lies
the ordinary world

06:14.265 --> 06:16.098
with its pleasures
and pains.

06:16.098 --> 06:19.014
It is an illusion with which
you are well-acquainted.

06:19.014 --> 06:21.515
Departure from this world

06:21.515 --> 06:25.515
means a departure from
all of its strange comforts--

06:25.515 --> 06:28.515
friends, family,

06:28.515 --> 06:31.014
strawberry ice cream.

06:31.014 --> 06:35.181
Those who walk left,
who dare to open that door,

06:35.181 --> 06:38.473
leave these comforts
behind.

06:38.473 --> 06:42.390
This is the moment
for you to reflect,

06:42.390 --> 06:47.223
to decide whether or not
you want to enter

06:47.223 --> 06:50.889
into the next realm,

06:50.889 --> 06:54.473
into the unknown.

06:59.223 --> 07:01.056
( shuddering breath )

07:11.598 --> 07:13.098
Samuel:
So, this is it.

07:13.098 --> 07:16.098
I cannot stop partway
through the procedure.

07:16.098 --> 07:17.931
You ready?

07:17.931 --> 07:20.098
Absolutely.

07:20.098 --> 07:21.473
Good.

07:29.098 --> 07:30.348
What?

07:31.557 --> 07:32.682
The money.

07:32.682 --> 07:34.931
Oh.
Yes, sorry.

07:34.931 --> 07:36.807
( chuckles )
I forgot.

07:36.807 --> 07:39.306
I hate money.

07:39.306 --> 07:41.598
I hate that
I have to ask.

07:43.765 --> 07:46.265
But if you wanna
spread the word,

07:46.265 --> 07:48.807
you need to survive,
and that requires money,

07:48.807 --> 07:50.306
plain and simple.

07:50.306 --> 07:52.723
Oh, yeah, I get it.

07:54.139 --> 07:57.390
Now remember, I know
this is a lot of money,

07:57.390 --> 08:01.223
but it is a one-time fee
and it will give you
lifetime access

08:01.223 --> 08:03.682
to all
the transcendent centers
across the country.

08:03.682 --> 08:08.348
And if you need
help transversing
the transcendence plane,

08:08.348 --> 08:13.223
you will have access
to any of Father's guides
at any time.

08:13.223 --> 08:15.431
- Okay?
- Sure.

08:17.306 --> 08:18.931
Samuel:
Here we go.

08:22.973 --> 08:26.640
If you're watching this tape,
you decided to proceed.

08:26.640 --> 08:31.098
Before you can transcend,
we must isolate and extract

08:31.098 --> 08:34.181
any nefarious agents
impeding your transition.

08:34.181 --> 08:36.223
This is
of utmost importance.

08:36.223 --> 08:40.348
As the operator goes through
a series of pressure gestures,

08:40.348 --> 08:44.848
it is crucial that you focus
on the music you hear.

08:44.848 --> 08:46.765
( note plays )

08:46.765 --> 08:50.014
Participant,
please close your eyes.

08:50.014 --> 08:52.348
( music continues )

09:00.682 --> 09:03.765
It's very late in the day.

09:03.765 --> 09:06.306
You're walking
through the woods

09:06.306 --> 09:09.515
towards a very large
redwood tree.

09:09.515 --> 09:12.682
( inhales deeply )
You can smell the wet moss

09:12.682 --> 09:16.931
and mildew
in the thick, cool air,

09:16.931 --> 09:21.557
feel grass and pine needles
crunching underfoot.

09:21.557 --> 09:24.431
Crunch, crunch.

09:24.431 --> 09:28.557
To your left and right
are perfectly round
pools of water,

09:28.557 --> 09:31.348
and at the bottom of each
of these pools of water

09:31.348 --> 09:33.640
is a round glass window,

09:33.640 --> 09:38.889
and through these windows,
you see things from the past.

09:38.889 --> 09:40.807
In one...

09:40.807 --> 09:43.139
the house
that you grew up in...

09:45.682 --> 09:48.431
the first person
you ever kissed...

09:50.807 --> 09:55.848
a cartoon snake
getting hit in the head
with a mallet.

09:55.848 --> 09:59.431
Inhale! Exhale!

09:59.431 --> 10:01.223
Keep walking.

10:01.223 --> 10:07.139
The tree looms larger now,
its dark green pine needles

10:07.139 --> 10:09.682
swaying ever so gently
in the breeze

10:09.682 --> 10:12.557
even as the sun
drops even further

10:12.557 --> 10:16.348
and the forest grows
that much darker.

10:16.348 --> 10:20.889
Still, you can catch things
from the past--

10:20.889 --> 10:24.265
the laughter of your mother,

10:24.265 --> 10:27.931
a bottle of your father's
favorite cologne.

10:27.931 --> 10:29.931
Smell it.

10:29.931 --> 10:32.807
Inhale. Exhale.

10:32.807 --> 10:35.265
Crunch. Crunch.

10:35.265 --> 10:37.098
- Crunch.
- ( note plays )

10:37.098 --> 10:39.807
- ( thunder rumbles )
- You stand before
the tree now.

10:39.807 --> 10:41.889
You take another step
towards it,

10:41.889 --> 10:44.889
and your left foot
hits something wet.

10:44.889 --> 10:47.640
You look down, and there's
a puddle before the tree.

10:47.640 --> 10:52.265
The only way to this tree
is to wade through this puddle.

10:52.265 --> 10:53.682
So you step into it.

10:53.682 --> 10:55.682
The water is up
to your ankles.

10:55.682 --> 10:59.682
You take another step,
and the bottom drops out
from beneath you.

10:59.682 --> 11:04.473
You're swallowed up entirely
by black water.

11:04.473 --> 11:06.265
Black!

11:06.265 --> 11:08.223
And then there's a glow.

11:08.223 --> 11:13.014
The last window,
a perfectly round
glass window.

11:13.014 --> 11:14.431
You swim up to it.

11:14.431 --> 11:16.973
You put your eyeball
up to the window.

11:16.973 --> 11:20.848
You look into it,
and it's you.

11:20.848 --> 11:26.598
Now...
what are you doing?

11:26.598 --> 11:28.098
I'm home.

11:36.181 --> 11:38.056
I'm doing dishes.

11:38.056 --> 11:41.014
I hear my mom
come home from work,

11:41.014 --> 11:42.765
and she slams the door.

11:45.348 --> 11:48.598
So hard, it makes
the windows rattle.

11:48.598 --> 11:51.014
She walks into the kitchen
and says,

11:51.014 --> 11:52.931
"You gettin' water
all over the place,"

11:52.931 --> 11:57.098
and she cracks me
right in the back
of the head real hard.

11:57.098 --> 11:59.056
Are you sure
it was your mother?

11:59.056 --> 12:00.723
Mm-hmm, it was her.

12:00.723 --> 12:04.723
She buys me a "MAD" magazine
that night, apologizes.

12:04.723 --> 12:06.640
She feels sorry about it
for weeks.

12:06.640 --> 12:08.557
Okay.

12:08.557 --> 12:12.515
Back away
from that memory,

12:12.515 --> 12:14.848
back into the blackness.

12:16.223 --> 12:18.889
There's a different window.

12:18.889 --> 12:20.723
I'm in the cafeteria.

12:20.723 --> 12:23.807
I sit down and there's
a group of my friends.

12:23.807 --> 12:26.931
They're all talking about
starting this babysitting club.

12:26.931 --> 12:28.765
I get excited and I say,
"Can I join?"

12:28.765 --> 12:32.723
And Tammy
looks at me and says,
"No, you can't join.

12:32.723 --> 12:34.515
You live on
the wrong side of town."

12:34.515 --> 12:37.056
And my feelings
got real hurt,

12:37.056 --> 12:39.473
so I just sat there

12:39.473 --> 12:42.390
and kept eating
in silence.

12:42.390 --> 12:45.223
- I--
- Good. Good.

12:45.223 --> 12:49.598
Now go back and look
for a different window.

12:49.598 --> 12:51.973
( thunder rumbles )

12:54.598 --> 12:56.306
Look at it closely.

12:56.306 --> 13:00.014
Is it really a dog,
or is it something else?

13:00.014 --> 13:01.889
Yeah.

13:01.889 --> 13:03.473
Yeah, it's just a dog.

13:05.098 --> 13:06.390
Okay, then.

13:10.181 --> 13:13.265
It's not working,
is it?

13:17.265 --> 13:18.431
Look hard.

13:18.431 --> 13:22.098
Tell me, do you see
anything supernatural?

13:22.098 --> 13:23.931
Is there something
in your past

13:23.931 --> 13:26.598
that you can't
logically explain,

13:26.598 --> 13:29.640
like ghosts or the bogeyman
or something?

13:29.640 --> 13:32.056
Well, sort of.

13:32.056 --> 13:35.848
There's this one time
when I kind of got hurt--

13:35.848 --> 13:39.848
or not hurt but kind of
messed around with

13:39.848 --> 13:42.056
by a magician.

13:42.056 --> 13:44.223
Okay, good.

13:44.223 --> 13:45.848
Tell me about that.

13:45.848 --> 13:51.765
I'm at school,
and the bell's just rung,

13:51.765 --> 13:54.056
and I'm walking home.

13:56.640 --> 13:58.223
Are you alone?

13:58.223 --> 14:00.473
No.

14:00.473 --> 14:03.931
No, my friend
Herman's with me.

14:03.931 --> 14:05.848
He's walking
alongside me

14:05.848 --> 14:11.807
and he says,
"Debbie, come with me
into the woods.

14:11.807 --> 14:14.139
I'm gonna show you
the knockando bird."

14:14.139 --> 14:18.223
- What's a knockando bird?
- That's what I asked Herman.

14:18.223 --> 14:21.348
And he says
it's this funny little bird

14:21.348 --> 14:24.014
that mushes its feathers
up on its head

14:24.014 --> 14:26.848
like a little top hat.

14:26.848 --> 14:28.682
And I say, "No way,
I don't believe you."

14:28.682 --> 14:31.640
And he says, "Well, then,
come with me and I'll show you.

14:31.640 --> 14:34.598
It's just right back there
in the woods a little bit."

14:34.598 --> 14:36.056
Did you go with him?

14:37.557 --> 14:38.848
Yeah.

14:38.848 --> 14:42.348
We walk over
this little bridge
made of plywood,

14:42.348 --> 14:44.848
and there's a little shack
right there on the other side.

14:44.848 --> 14:49.807
And there's all these
little holes drilled in it
down low,

14:49.807 --> 14:51.889
perfect little holes.

14:51.889 --> 14:54.431
And Herman says,
"Right there.

14:54.431 --> 14:56.889
Those are knockando holes.

14:56.889 --> 14:58.640
That's where
they come out."

14:58.640 --> 15:03.056
And something feels off.

15:03.056 --> 15:05.557
There's flies buzzing
all around

15:05.557 --> 15:09.473
and something that smells
kind of like...

15:09.473 --> 15:12.139
rotten eggs.

15:12.139 --> 15:13.682
I wanna turn back.

15:15.598 --> 15:17.265
But Herman says...

15:20.390 --> 15:23.056
"We walked
all the way out here.

15:23.056 --> 15:26.390
It'll just take one second
for me to flush out
one of these birds.

15:26.390 --> 15:29.557
Believe me,
it's like nothing
you never seen."

15:29.557 --> 15:34.473
So he goes right inside
and starts banging
on the wall

15:34.473 --> 15:37.598
and saying,
"Come close, Debbie.

15:37.598 --> 15:40.306
One of 'em's about
to fly out."

15:40.306 --> 15:44.682
I can see something
moving around inside.

15:46.889 --> 15:50.223
And right through
one of those holes...

15:51.765 --> 15:53.848
pops Herman's little penis.

15:53.848 --> 15:57.306
Just like that, pop.

15:57.306 --> 16:00.181
And he's saying,
"Knockando, knockando.

16:00.181 --> 16:02.765
Give it a tickle."

16:02.765 --> 16:06.098
But my mom,
she didn't want any boys

16:06.098 --> 16:09.014
fooling around with me
like that, and she told me,

16:09.014 --> 16:11.431
"Any boy ever take his pecker
out around you,

16:11.431 --> 16:13.431
you just hit it,"
so without even thinking,

16:13.431 --> 16:16.973
I pick up a rock,
and I just smashed his pecker!

16:16.973 --> 16:19.139
( thunder rumbles )

16:19.139 --> 16:22.223
He screams.

16:22.223 --> 16:25.139
He screams bloody murder.

16:25.139 --> 16:27.557
And I just go running back
the way we came.

16:29.390 --> 16:32.473
I never run so fast
in my entire life.

16:33.973 --> 16:37.431
So I go to school,
and I see Herman.

16:37.431 --> 16:39.223
And I'm like,
"Are you okay?"

16:39.223 --> 16:41.473
And a big old smile
on his face, he says,

16:41.473 --> 16:44.515
"Yep, you smashed me good.

16:44.515 --> 16:47.515
But the pink doctor came
and fixed me up.

16:47.515 --> 16:50.640
He made it even better
than it was before.

16:50.640 --> 16:51.973
It's bigger."

16:51.973 --> 16:53.973
( thunder rumbles )

16:53.973 --> 16:57.139
Herman says,
"Ooh, Debbie.

16:57.139 --> 16:59.682
That pink doctor's
so mad at you,

16:59.682 --> 17:01.931
he said if you don't go
and see him today,

17:01.931 --> 17:03.515
he's gonna go
and tell your mom.

17:03.515 --> 17:06.682
You better go see
the doctor."

17:06.682 --> 17:11.807
So, after school,
even though I'm nervous,

17:11.807 --> 17:16.557
I slip back through the fence
and find the little shack.

17:16.557 --> 17:19.723
Something feels off.

17:19.723 --> 17:22.306
Seriously off.

17:22.306 --> 17:26.348
It's almost like the air had a--
kind of like a buzz in it,

17:26.348 --> 17:29.181
an electrical buzz.

17:29.181 --> 17:30.598
I could hear it.

17:32.223 --> 17:36.723
And there's this white man
sitting there

17:36.723 --> 17:38.181
in a doctor's coat.

17:38.181 --> 17:40.973
And I say, "Are you
the pink doctor?"

17:40.973 --> 17:45.473
And he says, "No.
I ain't any kind of doctor.

17:45.473 --> 17:50.473
I'm just a magician
named John Knockando.

17:50.473 --> 17:54.056
"Do you wanna see
one of my tricks?"

17:54.056 --> 17:57.014
"No," I say.

17:57.014 --> 17:58.306
And when I turn around,

17:58.306 --> 18:00.473
he's got his arms
stiff down at his sides

18:00.473 --> 18:04.889
and he's floating, like,
five or six inches
off the ground.

18:04.889 --> 18:09.348
You wanna know what's
maybe the strangest part
about it all?

18:09.348 --> 18:13.265
It's that that afternoon,
I become a woman.

18:14.557 --> 18:16.931
I start bleeding
on the way home.

18:19.098 --> 18:21.931
It was the first time
that ever happened to me.

18:29.223 --> 18:32.348
Oh, my God.

18:32.348 --> 18:35.598
I haven't thought
about any of that
since I was a little girl.

18:37.557 --> 18:42.557
Transcendence
is magnificent,
isn't it?

18:44.056 --> 18:45.431
Yeah,

18:45.431 --> 18:48.889
but... am I there?

18:48.889 --> 18:52.056
I don't feel
any different?

18:52.056 --> 18:54.598
Well,
i-it's a powerful process.

18:54.598 --> 18:58.181
It might take a minute
to, um, kick in.

18:58.181 --> 18:59.515
Excuse me.

19:06.723 --> 19:09.431
- ( thunder crashes )
- ( door closes )

19:11.931 --> 19:13.889
( toilet flushes )

19:18.056 --> 19:21.098
Samuel,
tell me the truth.

19:23.306 --> 19:28.139
I knew from our correspondence
that you were a powerful soul

19:28.139 --> 19:31.223
with something
blocking your path.

19:31.223 --> 19:36.723
For you to fully transcend,
we must go forward.

19:36.723 --> 19:40.557
We must remove
the final blockage.

19:40.557 --> 19:41.640
Do you understand?

19:43.640 --> 19:45.889
Here's what I think

19:45.889 --> 19:48.931
you encountered
when you were a little girl.

19:51.431 --> 19:53.306
Father has encountered

19:53.306 --> 19:56.598
lots of incomplete
entities like this.

19:56.598 --> 19:58.515
They tried to stop him

19:58.515 --> 20:00.431
from transcendence
several times,

20:00.431 --> 20:02.931
but each time,
Father has to purge them

20:02.931 --> 20:06.181
before he can ascend
to the next level.

20:06.181 --> 20:08.098
- Does that make sense?
- No.

20:11.098 --> 20:13.682
I'm sorry, Samuel,
but not really.

20:13.682 --> 20:15.807
I mean, nothing like this
is in any of the texts.

20:15.807 --> 20:18.098
I know, this, uh--

20:18.098 --> 20:22.014
this is something
that Father--

20:22.014 --> 20:25.390
it's stuff he doesn't
like to talk about.

20:25.390 --> 20:28.723
Not a lot people encounter
this type of thing, Deborah.

20:32.056 --> 20:33.390
Let me just...

20:41.889 --> 20:44.848
- ( music playing )
- If you're watching
this tape,

20:44.848 --> 20:47.723
you're of a select minority.

20:47.723 --> 20:50.723
There are certain people
that are able to transcend

20:50.723 --> 20:52.723
more than others.

20:52.723 --> 20:56.848
There's a good side to this
and a bad side.

20:56.848 --> 21:00.139
The bad side is that
there are certain elements,

21:00.139 --> 21:05.265
incomplete entities that seek
to block your transcendence

21:05.265 --> 21:07.931
and to keep you
on this plane.

21:07.931 --> 21:09.765
Why?

21:09.765 --> 21:12.181
Sadly, nobody knows.

21:12.181 --> 21:17.807
And always, I've had to rid
my body of the blockage

21:17.807 --> 21:20.181
impeding my further
transcendence

21:20.181 --> 21:24.139
by undergoing
a simple procedure.

21:24.139 --> 21:28.473
When an incomplete entity
plants blockage in a person,

21:28.473 --> 21:30.431
it remains
in physical form

21:30.431 --> 21:33.014
high in said person's
nasal cavity

21:33.014 --> 21:36.723
where it sends out a signal
exerting control over

21:36.723 --> 21:39.265
and weakening
the pineal gland.

21:39.265 --> 21:41.139
However, the blockage
is nothing more

21:41.139 --> 21:45.014
than a fluid-filled sac
that can easily be popped

21:45.014 --> 21:49.431
by any administrator
using a simple tool.

21:49.431 --> 21:50.973
While uncomfortable,

21:50.973 --> 21:54.723
the procedure
is painless and brief.

21:57.723 --> 21:59.139
( zipper unzips )

22:09.807 --> 22:13.306
I did this exact same
procedure to Father.

22:13.306 --> 22:15.723
You know, I don't know
if I wanna do all of that.

22:15.723 --> 22:18.139
We've already begun
the procedure.

22:18.139 --> 22:19.723
You have to go
all the way through.

22:19.723 --> 22:21.973
- You agreed to it.
- Yeah, but I didn't know

22:21.973 --> 22:24.889
it would, uh,
entail all of this.

22:24.889 --> 22:26.682
What did you think
it would entail?

22:26.682 --> 22:29.598
Just pressure and tones,
what we were doing.

22:29.598 --> 22:31.515
For most, yeah,
that's enough.

22:31.515 --> 22:35.098
But when you have a blockage,
it must be drained.

22:35.098 --> 22:38.265
I just-- maybe if you were
a doctor or something,

22:38.265 --> 22:40.348
but I don't want
that thing up my nose.

22:40.348 --> 22:43.181
( exhales )

22:43.181 --> 22:46.973
I'm gonna say
two things.

22:46.973 --> 22:49.431
One...

22:49.431 --> 22:52.348
the reason we tell you
you have to continue
the process

22:52.348 --> 22:56.348
is if you stop
partway through,

22:56.348 --> 22:59.306
it could damage
your soul.

22:59.306 --> 23:00.973
I'm talking
the type of boo-boo

23:00.973 --> 23:04.181
that could take
lifetimes to heal.

23:04.181 --> 23:06.848
Two--
after the procedure,

23:06.848 --> 23:09.181
the procedure
that does not hurt at all,

23:09.181 --> 23:13.014
you will be amongst
the most powerful

23:13.014 --> 23:15.390
to ever transcend.

23:15.390 --> 23:17.098
In fact...

23:18.390 --> 23:21.265
I'm a little jealous
of you.

23:21.265 --> 23:23.056
( chuckles softly )

23:24.557 --> 23:27.056
It doesn't hurt?

23:27.056 --> 23:29.598
I already told you, no.

23:31.265 --> 23:36.306
Don't you feel
something stuck in there?

23:36.306 --> 23:39.014
Something blocking...

23:39.014 --> 23:41.390
that's...

23:41.390 --> 23:45.223
holding your thoughts,
stuffing your breath?

23:45.223 --> 23:47.807
I mean...

23:47.807 --> 23:50.640
yeah, of course, but...

23:50.640 --> 23:54.765
You feel that way
because that thing,

23:54.765 --> 23:58.348
the pink doctor,
or knockando,

23:58.348 --> 24:00.139
- or whatever you call it...
- ( thunder crashes )

24:00.139 --> 24:03.014
...it's circling
inside of you.

24:03.014 --> 24:04.765
But you don't
have to feel that way.

24:04.765 --> 24:08.473
You don't have to feel
that way at all!

24:10.931 --> 24:14.848
You are about
to transcend, dear.

24:14.848 --> 24:16.931
( sighs )

24:16.931 --> 24:19.515
Are you ready?

24:19.515 --> 24:21.265
Or not?

24:26.306 --> 24:27.682
Yes.

24:29.431 --> 24:30.807
I'm ready.

24:34.765 --> 24:36.598
( thunder crashing )

24:56.098 --> 24:59.139
Now, it ain't all that roomy
in your nasal cavity,

24:59.139 --> 25:00.931
so you're gonna feel
a little tightness

25:00.931 --> 25:03.640
as I work my way up
towards the blockage.

25:03.640 --> 25:06.014
But once I pass
the bridge of your nose,

25:06.014 --> 25:09.640
you'll feel a little pinch,
but that's about it, okay?

25:09.640 --> 25:12.014
Okay.

25:12.014 --> 25:14.014
- ( thunder crashing )
- Here we go.

25:18.848 --> 25:20.848
Get it in there.

25:22.765 --> 25:24.223
- Come on.
- ( whimpering )

25:31.515 --> 25:32.557
( note plays )

25:36.682 --> 25:37.765
( note plays )

25:39.598 --> 25:41.181
( Deborah sobbing )

25:41.181 --> 25:44.348
- That feel good?
- ( note plays )

25:44.348 --> 25:45.973
( sobbing continues )

25:48.014 --> 25:48.889
Come on, bitch!

25:52.181 --> 25:54.598
Take it, you fucking cunt!
Smile!

25:54.598 --> 25:57.390
- ( Deborah crying out )
- Inhale. Exhale.

26:00.807 --> 26:02.431
( screams )

26:02.431 --> 26:05.056
Knockando!
( screams )

26:05.056 --> 26:07.557
- I'm gonna rip it off!
- Let go of it!

26:07.557 --> 26:09.473
- Deborah: Smash it!
- No!

26:09.473 --> 26:13.348
- Deborah: Knockando!

I just wanna know, like...

27:29.306 --> 27:31.139
Do you think that if you'd
been out there with me...

27:31.473 --> 27:33.014
Do you think you
could have saved me?

27:33.557 --> 27:35.640
I assumed that if I was
being unsafe,

27:35.640 --> 27:37.473
you would've stopped me,
would've made me get out
of the water--

27:37.473 --> 27:39.223
-Not fair--
-That's what best friends do--

27:39.223 --> 27:41.181

Yes, this is your fault!

And you have never owned
up to it!
