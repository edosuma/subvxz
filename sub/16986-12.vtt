Womp is the worst at this game.

00:45.545 --> 00:47.798
He is the best at being the worst.

00:55.847 --> 00:57.808
[both]
Giant wart frog!

00:57.891 --> 00:59.160
You're supposed to say "stone-o."

00:59.184 --> 01:01.395
You guys are, like,
the worst at this game.

01:01.478 --> 01:02.478
[gasping]

01:02.521 --> 01:03.772
[Eep] It's Rad,

01:03.855 --> 01:06.608
the death guard.

01:13.323 --> 01:14.700
[groaning]

01:17.035 --> 01:20.330
Hey, here, little dude. Try this way.

01:20.998 --> 01:25.585
Uh, you're staring at Rad the way
I stare at you. It's pretty creepy.

01:25.669 --> 01:29.548
[sighs]
It's just, Rad's so... rad.

01:29.631 --> 01:32.884
[laughs] If she hadn't been there,
Womp would've been eaten.

01:32.968 --> 01:36.471
All while we just stood here,
watching the horror unfold.

01:36.555 --> 01:38.432
[giggling]

01:38.515 --> 01:43.103
Well, I don't wanna stand around anymore.
I want to be like Rad.

01:43.186 --> 01:46.565
She gets to do such cool stuff
and everyone loves her.

01:46.648 --> 01:48.191
[sighing]

01:48.275 --> 01:51.528
Rad! Rad! Eep Crood. Big fan.

01:51.612 --> 01:53.071
I have to ask you something.

01:53.155 --> 01:55.574
Um, and if you say no, I'll just die.

01:55.657 --> 01:56.908
Not on my watch.

01:59.244 --> 02:01.788
See? That is exactly what I wanna do.

02:01.872 --> 02:03.832
Oh, say cool stuff like that.

02:03.915 --> 02:07.210
Please, teach me
to be a death guard like you.

02:07.294 --> 02:08.919
You can't learn to be a death guard.

02:09.003 --> 02:10.464
You're just born that way.

02:10.547 --> 02:12.049
[wind blowing]

02:12.132 --> 02:13.717
But sure, I'll teach you.

02:13.800 --> 02:17.262
Really? Oh, my bonk! Ha ha!

02:17.346 --> 02:21.266
I'm gonna be a hero.
Thank you, thank you, thank you!

02:21.350 --> 02:23.685
Please. Two "thank you's" was enough.

02:23.769 --> 02:26.521
When you're a death guard,
every breath counts.

02:26.605 --> 02:30.067
Good tip. Thank you. I mean...

02:30.150 --> 02:31.234
[inhaling]

02:34.071 --> 02:35.280
[grunting]

02:35.364 --> 02:38.909
There. Now our disgusting trash
is outside in nature,

02:38.992 --> 02:40.202
where it belongs.

02:40.285 --> 02:41.453
[snarling]

Let me go, let me go!

02:45.290 --> 02:46.708
[sniffing]

02:46.792 --> 02:48.168
[barking]

02:48.251 --> 02:50.379
Whoa, what's wrong, Sandy?

02:50.462 --> 02:51.797
[sniffing]

02:51.880 --> 02:53.215
[barking]

02:53.298 --> 02:55.384
Oh, that's not gonna hurt ya.

02:55.467 --> 02:56.927
It's just a rock, see?

02:57.010 --> 02:59.096
Same kind we use to bonk and bludgeon.

02:59.179 --> 03:03.934
Oh, hey, you found my snack meat.
I lost this ages ago.

03:07.646 --> 03:09.898
Pretty strong sniffer
you've got there.

03:10.440 --> 03:12.526
[barking]

03:12.609 --> 03:13.860
[sniffing]

03:13.944 --> 03:16.113
[continues sniffing]

03:19.449 --> 03:22.327
[barking]

03:22.411 --> 03:23.495
Here, girl?

03:23.578 --> 03:24.830
[giggles]

03:25.872 --> 03:26.748
[gasps]

03:26.832 --> 03:28.333
Bear owl teeth!

03:28.417 --> 03:31.002
We never see these,
unless they're tearing you apart.

03:31.586 --> 03:32.587
[roaring]

03:32.671 --> 03:34.131
Hey, neighbor.

03:34.214 --> 03:36.425
- What you got there?
- Oh, nothing.

03:36.508 --> 03:39.553
My daughter's just a treasure-finding
force of nature. How are you?

03:39.636 --> 03:41.638
[sniffing]

03:41.722 --> 03:43.765
Come on, Papa wants a new carcass.

03:43.849 --> 03:47.436
Treasure, huh?
Ready to earn your keep, Cliff?

03:47.936 --> 03:52.065
No, thumbs are for finders,
so let's go find some treasure.

03:52.566 --> 03:56.069
You are gonna be a great death guard, Eep,
but if you need more practice,

03:56.153 --> 03:59.573
I'm willing to fake-die for you
right here, any time you want.

03:59.656 --> 04:01.742
[gasping]

04:01.825 --> 04:02.826
Thanks, Lerk.

04:02.909 --> 04:05.996
Well, I'm off to save lives
and high fives.

04:06.663 --> 04:07.789
Oh, my bad, Eep.

04:07.873 --> 04:10.625
Didn't see you. I was
just rinsing off this slak goo.

04:12.294 --> 04:15.338
Anyway, ready for your first
extreme death guarding task?

04:15.422 --> 04:17.716
Yeah! Ha ha! What is it?

04:17.798 --> 04:20.802
Rinsing off this slak goo.
There's an extreme amount of it.

04:20.886 --> 04:22.012
Oh, let me guess.

04:22.095 --> 04:24.806
We've gotta be super careful
because it's poisonous.

04:24.890 --> 04:28.143
[gasps]
If we touch it, we'll die.

04:28.226 --> 04:31.271
No, it's basically purple snot,
but we don't want people to fall.

04:31.354 --> 04:32.354
[grunts]

04:32.397 --> 04:34.566
Oh. Well, that's less exciting.

04:34.649 --> 04:37.527
Well, death guarding is all
about preventing death.

04:37.611 --> 04:41.448
That, and waiting for the perfect wave.

04:41.531 --> 04:42.991
[wind blowing]

04:43.325 --> 04:45.035
What are we staring at?

04:45.118 --> 04:48.371
Destiny. But until then, purple snot.

04:51.792 --> 04:52.793
[grunting]

04:53.502 --> 04:57.798
Okay, there. Done. Now, uh, let's go save
some lives in a dramatic fashion.

04:57.881 --> 04:58.924
Not yet.

04:59.424 --> 05:01.676
See, mudscreen protects us
against the sun

05:01.760 --> 05:04.638
by tricking it into thinking
we're the ground.

05:04.721 --> 05:06.431
- Yoo-hoo.
- [gasping]

05:07.182 --> 05:09.017
Behold the Root.

05:10.393 --> 05:12.854
It's gonna need at least three coats.

05:13.396 --> 05:15.982
Hah! There. Seaweed is all sorted.

05:16.066 --> 05:18.777
And now to mix it back together.

05:18.860 --> 05:20.070
[laughs]

05:20.153 --> 05:22.322
Sometimes I wonder why we even do this.

05:22.405 --> 05:23.323
[groans]

05:23.406 --> 05:25.158
- [panicked cries]
- [gasps]

05:25.242 --> 05:31.748
Are those panicked cries for help?
Finally! Ha ha! I mean, coming.

05:31.998 --> 05:34.668
[screaming]

05:34.751 --> 05:37.295
Aw, please don't tell me
you had an accident.

05:37.379 --> 05:40.632
Uh, no.

05:41.007 --> 05:44.427
It was on purpose.
[giggling]

05:45.595 --> 05:48.765
- [sniffing]
- Excellent sniffing, Sandy.

05:49.432 --> 05:50.934
Just look at all these treasures.

05:51.017 --> 05:53.895
Eggs, bones, more eggs,
whatever this is.

05:54.354 --> 05:57.107
I don't know if I'm supposed to
wear it or eat it or...

05:58.191 --> 05:59.401
Oh!

06:00.777 --> 06:02.654
Or neither.

06:02.737 --> 06:04.114
[gasps, sniffing]

06:04.197 --> 06:05.782
Another scent? Under that rock?

06:05.865 --> 06:07.742
That a girl, Sandy!

06:07.826 --> 06:10.036
Good job, Cliff!

06:10.537 --> 06:12.622
Hey, hey, we sniffed that first.

06:12.706 --> 06:14.082
Sure, it's a very small pelt,

06:14.165 --> 06:16.001
but you never know what'll look good on.

06:16.084 --> 06:19.296
Uh-uh. Finders keepers, losers losers.

06:19.379 --> 06:23.758
Oh, is this blood? Fancy.

06:23.842 --> 06:24.968
[sniffing]

06:25.051 --> 06:28.555
Oh, ha! You're not gonna get
my treasure this time!

06:29.556 --> 06:30.557
But we are.

06:30.640 --> 06:33.560
Some people are so desperate.

06:33.643 --> 06:34.519
Onward, brother.

06:34.603 --> 06:36.896
- [laughing]
- [Squawk] I expect results, baby.

06:37.564 --> 06:39.065
Great job today, Eep.

06:39.149 --> 06:41.943
You're really starting to look
like a death guard.

06:42.027 --> 06:43.278
I'm definitely feeling dead.

06:43.361 --> 06:46.615
And I've saved
the most extreme task for last.

06:46.698 --> 06:49.826
[groans] Should I even bother
getting my hopes up?

06:50.368 --> 06:51.911
Watching the turmel.

06:53.371 --> 06:54.581
Good-bye, hopes.

06:54.664 --> 06:55.957
Gotta watch out for him.

06:56.041 --> 06:59.919
He's the biggest threat
to the watering hole there is.

07:00.003 --> 07:01.630
[screaming]

07:01.713 --> 07:02.713
[grunting]

07:02.756 --> 07:04.549
Hey, we're watching you.

07:05.592 --> 07:09.220
Keep an eye on him till I get back.
I gotta go sort that seaweed again.

07:09.930 --> 07:12.891
[groans]
Why did I sign up for this again?

07:12.974 --> 07:16.353
[yawns] You're obviously
not going anywhere.

07:19.564 --> 07:20.982
[sighs]

07:21.066 --> 07:24.861
Maybe I can whip up some death-guarding
excitement in my dreams.

07:24.945 --> 07:29.491
Let's see. Sulk in the deep end,
about to be devoured.

07:29.574 --> 07:31.743
Ho ho, let's do this.

07:31.826 --> 07:33.954
[yawns]

07:38.249 --> 07:39.250
[growling]

07:40.043 --> 07:42.921
This is so unfair.
All these treasures should be mine.

07:43.004 --> 07:44.547
[sniffing, gasps]

07:46.049 --> 07:47.050
[growling]

07:47.133 --> 07:51.096
Sorry, ours.
I didn't forget about your finder's fee.

07:54.015 --> 07:55.517
[gasps, sniffing]

07:58.311 --> 08:02.607
Wow. They must smell
something rank. It's mine!

08:04.359 --> 08:07.821
No! We can't let 'em get there first,
Sandy, whatever it takes.

08:09.197 --> 08:10.197
[cries out]

08:11.032 --> 08:12.032
[groaning]

08:15.120 --> 08:18.081
- [gasps]
- Smell that? It's fear.

08:19.874 --> 08:22.252
- [snarling]
- [screams]

08:22.669 --> 08:24.504
[grunts]

08:24.587 --> 08:25.588
[spits]

08:27.465 --> 08:28.383
Ah, ha ha!

08:28.466 --> 08:30.176
We did it! It's ours!

08:30.260 --> 08:32.053
The best treasure of all.

08:32.136 --> 08:34.514
Huh? Our trash!

08:34.597 --> 08:36.265
Aw, gross!

08:36.349 --> 08:38.018
- Ours!
- I also would like this.

08:38.101 --> 08:39.269
[grunts]

08:39.352 --> 08:40.395
Mine!

08:40.477 --> 08:42.522
- What am I doing, Sandy?
- [Squawk] Mine, mine, mine!

08:42.605 --> 08:46.317
I don't need any junk.
I've got everything I need right here.

08:47.652 --> 08:50.006
Plus, I totally grabbed this from Teena
when she wasn't looking.

08:50.030 --> 08:51.239
[chortling]

08:51.322 --> 08:52.615
I look fierce.

08:53.700 --> 08:56.870
Guys, guys, I know.
I'm a great death guard.

08:56.953 --> 08:59.873
But don't you think
you've high-fived me enough?

08:59.956 --> 09:03.752
No? Okay.
[laughing]

09:03.835 --> 09:05.128
[Lerk]
Eep, help!

09:05.211 --> 09:07.589
There's trouble in the watering hole.
And we can't find Rad.

09:07.672 --> 09:08.965
We need a death guard.

09:09.049 --> 09:11.384
Trouble? And I'm awake?

09:11.468 --> 09:13.720
[chuckling]
I'm on it!

09:14.804 --> 09:16.389
[grunting]

09:16.473 --> 09:17.932
[groans]

09:19.934 --> 09:21.603
Where's all the water?

09:21.686 --> 09:22.854
What happened?

09:22.937 --> 09:23.937
[Lerk] It's a mystery.

09:23.980 --> 09:26.983
Can we really explain how anything
in this crazy life works?

09:27.067 --> 09:30.028
We may just need to accept
that we'll never know.

09:30.111 --> 09:31.237
Or it was that.

09:32.697 --> 09:33.697
[sighing]

09:33.740 --> 09:36.743
Man, somebody should've
kept an eye on that thing.

09:36.826 --> 09:40.747
Turmel. I thought we had an understanding.

09:40.830 --> 09:41.915
[belching]

09:41.998 --> 09:44.959
[sighs]
You're right. This is on me.

09:45.043 --> 09:48.922
I gotta get you to spit this water out
before Rad gets back.

09:49.005 --> 09:50.507
[sighing]

09:51.007 --> 09:54.511
Death guard is here
and I got this under control.

09:54.594 --> 09:57.722
[crowd]
Eep, Eep, Eep, Eep, Eep, Eep.

09:57.806 --> 10:00.350
Finally, my moment.

10:08.358 --> 10:10.068
Wow, that was easy.

10:10.151 --> 10:12.946
[giggling] Especially for a plan
I barely thought out.

10:16.616 --> 10:19.661
Turmel wave!

10:21.246 --> 10:22.288
[gasps]

10:26.876 --> 10:28.795
[screaming]

10:33.383 --> 10:34.759

10:45.103 --> 10:47.105

10:59.033 --> 11:01.953
Can't believe I missed the perfect wave.

11:02.036 --> 11:05.582
Bummer. Maybe I didn't need
to mix that seaweed a third time.

11:05.665 --> 11:10.170
Well, small stuff can be just as important
as the big, exciting stuff.

11:10.253 --> 11:12.422
[chuckles]
And less terrifying.

11:12.505 --> 11:15.675
I think I finally get what
death guarding is all about.

11:15.758 --> 11:19.387
Gnarly. Then you can
train our new recruit.

11:20.763 --> 11:23.349
Behold the Root.

11:23.433 --> 11:26.019
[groans, grunting]

11:26.102 --> 11:28.813
[sighs]
Looks like I got more work to do.

11:28.897 --> 11:32.817
Great, 'cause I could also use
another coat of mudscreen.

11:41.367 --> 11:44.203
[Ugga sighs]
Another beautiful day.

11:44.287 --> 11:47.832
- The sun is shining, the prey is dying.
- [groaning]

11:48.249 --> 11:50.376
And the Gran is bored!

11:50.460 --> 11:51.753
[moaning]

11:51.836 --> 11:53.630
Why don't you go to gardening club?

11:53.713 --> 11:55.214
[scoffs]
No, thanks.

11:55.298 --> 11:58.217
It's gonna rain.
I can feel it in my bones.

11:58.301 --> 11:59.177
[joints cracking]

11:59.260 --> 12:01.512
- That crack says we're gettin' rain.
- [cracking]

12:01.596 --> 12:02.931
Make that heavy rain,

12:03.014 --> 12:05.600
- with cloud burps and...
- [cracking]

12:05.683 --> 12:07.310
lightning.

12:07.393 --> 12:10.396
Point is, rain is boring!

12:10.480 --> 12:13.191
So do dumb stuff for my amusement.

12:13.274 --> 12:16.319
Sorry. If it's gonna rain, I gotta get
gathering right away.

12:17.946 --> 12:21.950
Fine. But at least get that spider ant
off your back.

12:22.033 --> 12:24.160
[screaming]

12:24.243 --> 12:25.411
[chuckles]

12:25.495 --> 12:27.163
[groaning]
Mom!

12:27.246 --> 12:31.376
I don't care if you're bored,
you shouldn't mess with people for fun.

12:31.459 --> 12:33.503
Only for personal gain. Got it!

12:33.586 --> 12:36.547
No. One of these days,
it's gonna get you in a lot of trouble.

12:36.631 --> 12:38.967
[gasping]
That spider ant is back!

12:39.050 --> 12:41.511
- [screams]
- [cackling]

12:41.594 --> 12:43.429
[growling] I...

12:43.513 --> 12:44.764
[groaning]

12:44.847 --> 12:45.890
[cackling]

12:45.974 --> 12:47.892
Oh, don't go.

12:47.976 --> 12:52.313
Now what? You can't have a good time
without a victim.

12:52.397 --> 12:53.940
[humming]

12:54.023 --> 12:55.733
Well, I'm off to the hunt!

12:55.817 --> 12:57.944
Not sure why I just yelled that!

12:58.027 --> 12:59.404
Or that!

12:59.487 --> 13:00.530
Huntin', eh?

13:00.613 --> 13:04.033
Hope you're takin' an extra pelt
'cause it's gonna rain.

13:04.117 --> 13:06.953
Also because that one's hideous.

13:07.036 --> 13:10.331
Please. I know
I'm dressed to kill... prey.

13:10.415 --> 13:13.918
Besides, it's a beautiful day out.

13:14.002 --> 13:16.254
[cackling]

13:17.964 --> 13:19.966
How did you know it was gonna rain?

13:20.049 --> 13:21.926
- Oh, it's just my...
- [cracking]

13:22.010 --> 13:24.637
my... my power.

13:24.721 --> 13:27.515
Yep, this old gal can control the weather.

13:27.598 --> 13:28.516
Since when?

13:28.599 --> 13:31.477
Since I had a dream
last night that I could

13:31.561 --> 13:33.271
and this morning it was true.

13:33.354 --> 13:37.150
Pfft. I had a dream about you moving out,
and that never comes true.

13:37.233 --> 13:38.985
Fine. I'll prove it.

13:40.111 --> 13:41.279
[cracking]

13:41.362 --> 13:42.530
With a cloud burp.

13:43.614 --> 13:44.615
[thunder rumbling]

13:44.699 --> 13:45.742
[screams]

13:45.825 --> 13:48.870
Stay away from me!
Even further than usual!

13:49.662 --> 13:50.955
[yelping]

13:51.039 --> 13:52.707
[cackling]

13:52.790 --> 13:55.918
Today's weather will be cloudy
with a chance of giggles.

13:56.002 --> 13:57.128
[giggling]

13:57.545 --> 14:00.339
Oh, no, the monster's
sneaking up behind her!

14:00.423 --> 14:01.799
Turn around!

14:01.883 --> 14:03.134
I can't watch.
[groaning]

14:06.554 --> 14:09.265
- [wind howling]
- Aw, not now.

14:09.348 --> 14:10.266
[sighs]

14:10.349 --> 14:12.602
- Guess we could go catch raindrops.
- [thunder rumbling]

14:12.685 --> 14:15.188
Go outside in the storm?

14:15.271 --> 14:19.317
- No, no, I don't think so, because, uh...
- [thunder rumbling]

14:19.400 --> 14:23.196
'cause, uh, I'm worried about
how scared Sandy must be.

14:24.030 --> 14:26.866
[howling]

14:26.949 --> 14:28.743
She seems terrified.

14:28.826 --> 14:31.662
But fine, we can stay in if you want.

14:31.746 --> 14:34.540
Just don't blame me
when you get cave brain.

14:34.624 --> 14:36.376
- Cave brain?
- Yeah.

14:36.459 --> 14:39.253
When you stay inside too long,
it messes with your head.

14:39.337 --> 14:42.090
It makes you act weird and unpredictable.

14:42.173 --> 14:44.801
[moaning]

14:44.884 --> 14:45.802
[cheering]

14:45.885 --> 14:48.805
Which I guess wouldn't be all that
different for you.

14:49.347 --> 14:52.266
Seriously, you guys,
Gran just waved her hand and it was like,

14:52.350 --> 14:54.227
"kablow, sploom", and I was, like...

14:54.310 --> 14:55.686
[screaming]

14:55.770 --> 14:57.897
Until my butt itched
and I stopped to go...

14:57.980 --> 14:59.357
[sighing]

14:59.440 --> 15:00.440
And...

15:01.692 --> 15:02.944
Forget that last part.

15:03.027 --> 15:07.615
No one boss of weather.
Grug just scared of old lady.

15:07.698 --> 15:09.242
Hey, who said I was scared?

15:09.325 --> 15:11.119
- Hi, Grug.
- [shrieking]

15:11.202 --> 15:13.037
[laughing]

15:14.789 --> 15:16.874
Old lady right to laugh at Grug.

15:16.958 --> 15:19.877
Old lady lower on food chain
than chickuna.

15:19.961 --> 15:22.964
Is Amber right or what?
[laughter]

15:23.047 --> 15:24.424
Oh, yeah, One-Eyes?

15:24.507 --> 15:28.010
This old lady says cluck
like a chickuna, now!

15:28.094 --> 15:29.094
[chuckling]

15:29.137 --> 15:30.680
Old lady funny.

15:30.763 --> 15:34.350
Now complete high five Amber started.

15:34.434 --> 15:36.727
Don't leave Amber hanging.

15:36.811 --> 15:39.897
- I said cluck, or I'll...
- [cracking]

15:39.981 --> 15:42.066
or I'll strike you with lightning.

15:42.150 --> 15:43.651
[thunder rumbling]

15:44.777 --> 15:46.946
[clucking]

15:47.029 --> 15:50.158
Now, Grug, juggle these two chickuna.

15:50.241 --> 15:51.826
But I work with these people.

15:51.909 --> 15:53.035
[murmuring]

15:53.119 --> 15:54.287
[sighing]

15:55.371 --> 15:56.622
- [groaning]
- [laughing]

15:56.706 --> 15:58.583
Oh, yeah!

15:58.666 --> 16:01.377
Now this is entertainment!

16:01.461 --> 16:05.173
Oh, but I wanna go bigger.

16:05.256 --> 16:06.507
Chickuna fight.

16:08.843 --> 16:11.345
[grunting]

16:11.429 --> 16:13.598
Just fall over so this ends.

16:13.681 --> 16:15.516
You want Amber take dive?

16:15.600 --> 16:18.311
[grunting]

16:18.394 --> 16:20.730
- [screams]
- [squeals]

16:21.481 --> 16:23.441
Sing me a pretty song.

16:23.524 --> 16:24.609
Uh...

16:24.692 --> 16:28.321
<i>♪ This is a pretty song
Won't you sing along? ♪</i>

16:28.404 --> 16:30.072
<i>♪ This is our pretty song ♪</i>

16:30.156 --> 16:32.158
<i>♪ We'll sing about pretty things
all day long ♪</i>

16:32.241 --> 16:34.744
- Yeah!
- Prettier. And dance.

16:35.828 --> 16:38.039
<i>♪ Flowers, sunshine, bloody prey ♪</i>

16:38.122 --> 16:40.791
<i>♪ But none are so pretty
as Gran today ♪</i>

16:40.875 --> 16:42.168
[grunting]

16:42.668 --> 16:44.253
[Thunk]
Look at that, a tie.

16:44.337 --> 16:46.422
[groaning]
Of course it's a tie.

16:46.506 --> 16:49.509
Every game of Stick, Stack, Stone
has been a tie.

16:49.592 --> 16:51.594
- [snoring]
- So far.

16:51.677 --> 16:55.139
But something tells me
that's all about to change.

16:55.223 --> 16:58.559
No! I can't take it anymore!

16:58.643 --> 17:00.770
- We gotta go outside.
- Outside?

17:00.853 --> 17:01.854
[thunder rumbling]

17:02.230 --> 17:03.523
Please don't leave me alone.

17:03.606 --> 17:05.858
We can play any game you want.

17:06.358 --> 17:10.279
Mmm. I know a game.

17:10.363 --> 17:11.989
[chuckling]

17:12.073 --> 17:14.534
It's called "hunter-prey."

17:14.617 --> 17:17.244
How about we play
"hide and go hide some more"?

17:17.328 --> 17:18.913
- [yelps]
- [thunder rumbling]

17:19.163 --> 17:22.625
[all]
All praise the mother of the storm!

17:22.708 --> 17:26.087
All praise the mother of the storm!

17:26.170 --> 17:29.674
Great. Now just those worthy
of kissin' my feet.

17:30.925 --> 17:32.927
That's right.
None of you are worthy.

17:33.010 --> 17:36.013
Mom? Why are people bowing to you?

17:36.097 --> 17:37.932
Nope, I'm just gonna skip to the end.

17:38.015 --> 17:40.184
No touch Mother of Storm,

17:40.268 --> 17:44.772
or Mother of Storm punish us
with weather powers!

17:44.855 --> 17:46.941
- Who?
- The Rider of Lightning.

17:47.024 --> 17:48.693
The Master of Rain.

17:48.776 --> 17:50.736
- The Breaker of Wind.
- [fart squeaks]

17:51.612 --> 17:52.613
Hear me roar.

17:52.697 --> 17:55.825
Mom, what did I say
about messing with people?

17:55.908 --> 17:58.327
Guys, my mother can't control
the weather.

17:58.411 --> 17:59.620
Her joints are just...

17:59.704 --> 18:01.664
Silence the unbeliever.

18:10.673 --> 18:13.801
Guys, Ugga's my wife.
Do we have to do this?

18:13.884 --> 18:18.306
Amber always say, better to err on side
of shoving people in logs.

18:18.931 --> 18:20.474
- [grunting]
- [muffled yelling]

18:22.893 --> 18:27.315
Mother of Storm, please not judge
followers for Ugga disrespect.

18:27.398 --> 18:29.525
Oh, don't be afraid, child.

18:29.609 --> 18:32.778
As long as you do
all the dumb stuff I say,

18:32.862 --> 18:33.946
I'll never hurt you.

18:34.030 --> 18:35.990

[tornado howling]

18:39.994 --> 18:42.872
I was the best Womp I could be!

18:42.955 --> 18:44.749
Okay, that was my bad.

18:44.832 --> 18:46.917
[chuckles]
I won't let that happen again.

18:47.001 --> 18:48.419
- [joints cracking]
- [screaming]

18:50.880 --> 18:52.423
Gran, we did everything you asked.

18:52.506 --> 18:54.342
Why are you making the storm worse?

18:54.425 --> 18:56.594
Well, I wouldn't say it's worse.

18:57.553 --> 18:58.971
[screams]

18:59.055 --> 19:01.057
Uh, he knows why that happened.

19:01.140 --> 19:04.310
The old woman cannot be appeased.

19:04.393 --> 19:08.230
If Gran not stop rain, we stop Gran.

19:10.191 --> 19:11.484
Uh, hey, guys, wait.

19:11.567 --> 19:14.111
This is my wife's mother
we're talking about.

19:14.195 --> 19:15.195
Use this one.

19:16.572 --> 19:18.658
Wait! Stop! I... uh...

19:18.741 --> 19:20.910
Okay, you got me.

19:20.993 --> 19:23.704
I... I can't control the weather.

19:23.788 --> 19:25.414
It was just tricks.

19:25.498 --> 19:28.167
You see, changes in weather
make my joints act up.

19:28.250 --> 19:29.794
Yeah. Nice try.

19:29.877 --> 19:33.005
But Grug Crood does not fall
for such obvious lies.

19:33.089 --> 19:34.965
Everybody get the magic weather queen!

Uh, uh, you don't wanna hunt me.

19:46.477 --> 19:48.062
You deserve more of a challenge.

- Eh, I'll make do.

19:49.480 --> 19:53.150
Eep, you have cave brain.
You need to go outside.

Cave brain? Pfft!

19:55.152 --> 19:57.196
[cackling]

I'm fine.
Now hold still so I can bonk you.

Ohh!

Cave brain.

20:26.684 --> 20:28.644
Thunk, I am so sorry.

20:28.728 --> 20:30.187
[nervous chuckle]
It's okay.

20:30.271 --> 20:33.023
And, hey, I'm not scared
of the storm anymore.

20:33.107 --> 20:35.317

- In fact, this is sorta nice.

20:36.152 --> 20:37.486

Actually, no. This is horrifying.

Ha! Control the weather?

20:47.413 --> 20:50.541

when she has to go...

20:50.624 --> 20:54.086
Pee-ople are trying to kill me!

20:54.170 --> 20:58.716
Well, well. If only your perfect daughter
had told you this was gonna...

20:58.799 --> 21:00.551
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you were right.

21:00.634 --> 21:03.387
Blah, blah, blah.
You gonna help me or what?

21:03.471 --> 21:05.848
[sighs]
I guess that's as sincere as you get.

21:05.931 --> 21:08.309
You need to tell the truth.

21:08.851 --> 21:12.813
I already told them the lousy truth,
but they didn't believe me.

21:12.897 --> 21:16.233
[overlapping chatter]

21:18.110 --> 21:20.738
Okay. Fine. Follow my lead.

21:20.821 --> 21:23.365
Everyone, you have it all wrong.

21:23.449 --> 21:26.035
Bonking Gran won't make her
stop the storm.

21:26.118 --> 21:27.912
Yeah. Listen to her.

21:27.995 --> 21:30.498
We gotta throw her off a cliff.

21:30.581 --> 21:32.458
Uh, who off the what now?

21:32.541 --> 21:34.251
- Why Amber not think of that?
- Of course.

21:34.335 --> 21:36.420
Cliffs are always the answer.

21:36.504 --> 21:38.172
[screaming]

21:40.716 --> 21:42.968
[screaming]

21:48.808 --> 21:50.518
[shrieking]

21:50.601 --> 21:52.228
[cackling]

21:53.187 --> 21:56.732
Gran? But I chucked you off the side.

21:56.816 --> 21:59.902
Are you unchuckable?

21:59.985 --> 22:01.237
[chuckling]
Yep.

22:01.320 --> 22:03.697
I can't be killed.

22:04.406 --> 22:10.621
Eh... but my one-time-only-
comeback-from-the-dead power

22:10.704 --> 22:13.123
made me lose my gift
of controlling the weather.

22:13.207 --> 22:16.168
So now I'm back to normal.

22:16.252 --> 22:18.337
Hey, my joints are feeling better.

22:19.713 --> 22:21.257
Hey, look, the sun's back.

22:21.340 --> 22:23.843
I guess almost killing Gran did work.

22:23.926 --> 22:26.303
[overlapping muttering]

22:26.512 --> 22:29.515
Well, Gran, I hope you learned
something from all this.

22:29.598 --> 22:30.599
I sure did.

22:30.683 --> 22:35.938
That my little girl can lie through
her teeth just as good as her mom.

22:36.021 --> 22:37.356
- [laughing]
- [sighs]

22:37.439 --> 22:39.525
That's not what I meant.

22:39.608 --> 22:41.944
