00:01.875 --> 00:03.458
[narrator]
Previously onX-Men...

00:03.458 --> 00:04.750
You either follow orders
like the other members

00:04.750 --> 00:06.208
of this team
or you're out of it.

00:06.208 --> 00:07.833
If you want to settle this,
mon ami

00:07.833 --> 00:09.166
then let's do it!

00:09.166 --> 00:10.708
What started this?

00:10.708 --> 00:12.375
I thought it was dangerous
for Gambit

00:12.375 --> 00:14.291
to spread unfounded rumors.

00:14.291 --> 00:17.458
It's not a rumor.
I know someone who was there.

00:17.458 --> 00:20.000
The Genoshans,
they welcome mutants
to their island.

00:20.000 --> 00:24.333
If the inhabitants of Genosha
are encouraging mutants
to live among them,

00:24.333 --> 00:26.458
this is an opportunity
we can't miss.

00:26.458 --> 00:28.875
Please, Cyclops, can I go?
Please?

00:29.458 --> 00:32.458
Sure, Jubilee,
I guess a beach
can't be too dangerous.

00:32.875 --> 00:34.333
[receptionist]
Welcome
to the Genosha Beach Inn.

00:39.208 --> 00:42.583
I've got the perfect rooms
for you. Just perfect.

00:46.291 --> 00:47.375
We've got to get out!

00:48.708 --> 00:50.833
[Genoshan commander]
Surrender, mutants!

00:57.500 --> 00:58.708
[Jubilee]
No!

01:00.333 --> 01:02.291
[theme music playing]

02:01.250 --> 02:03.458
[alarm blaring]

02:04.750 --> 02:05.875
[gasps]

02:05.875 --> 02:07.458
[collar beeping]

02:07.458 --> 02:09.416
[Leader on PA]
Mutants of Genosha!

02:09.875 --> 02:11.708
A new day begins!

02:12.250 --> 02:15.375
You have been brought here
to build a new Genosha

02:15.875 --> 02:19.250
a nation worthy of me,
its Leader.

02:19.250 --> 02:21.000
Be happy in your work.

02:23.083 --> 02:25.708
[commander]
The collars that suppress
your mutant powers

02:25.708 --> 02:27.291
will be turned off.

02:27.291 --> 02:29.416
So you can use your powers
in your work.

02:30.000 --> 02:33.958
If you try to escape,
the collars will be reactivated
at once.

02:34.500 --> 02:37.875
If you try to remove
your collar, it will explode

02:37.875 --> 02:39.166
and destroy you.

02:39.625 --> 02:42.291
Great vacation, Gambit.

02:42.291 --> 02:43.708
Now get to work!

02:44.250 --> 02:45.458
[beeping stops]

02:45.458 --> 02:47.291
Now! Gambit! Jubilee!

02:47.708 --> 02:49.125
No use, petite!

02:49.125 --> 02:51.416
Let me go, Gambit!

02:52.875 --> 02:54.000
[grunts]

02:57.375 --> 02:58.416
[collars beeping]

02:59.250 --> 03:00.708
My powers!

03:01.875 --> 03:03.000
Storm!

03:05.166 --> 03:07.833
[screaming]

03:10.500 --> 03:12.083
[gasping]

03:25.125 --> 03:26.250
That's a Sentinel!

03:26.875 --> 03:29.000
I thought we wiped out
those overgrown dweebs!

03:29.000 --> 03:31.125
There's always more gators
in the bayou.

03:45.083 --> 03:48.583
This mutant apprehended
while attempting to escape.

03:49.583 --> 03:51.958
Storm! Leave her alone!

03:52.375 --> 03:53.458
[Jubilee exclaims]

03:53.458 --> 03:54.875
Be quiet for once!

03:54.875 --> 03:56.208
The Leader has promised

03:56.208 --> 03:57.833
that you mutants
will be released

03:57.833 --> 04:00.000
once this dam is built.

04:00.000 --> 04:03.291
But if you try to escape,
you will never leave Genosha.

04:03.291 --> 04:05.583
That's one
of the Mutant Registration guys

04:05.583 --> 04:08.208
that grabbed me
after the weirdness back home
at the mall!

04:08.625 --> 04:10.750
I guess when the President
canceled his program

04:10.750 --> 04:12.583
he moved south for his health.

04:12.583 --> 04:14.458
We have to do something!

04:14.458 --> 04:16.958
Dispose of this one,
permanently.

04:18.166 --> 04:19.333
[Gambit]
You're making a mistake!

04:22.875 --> 04:24.208
You don't know what she can do!

04:24.208 --> 04:26.375
Gambit! What are you doing?

04:26.875 --> 04:29.875
-Knowledge is power!
-Be silent.

04:30.500 --> 04:32.333
According to her
interrogation...

04:32.333 --> 04:34.083
She didn't tell you nothing.

04:34.583 --> 04:36.000
She can control the weather!

04:36.000 --> 04:38.458
She'll make it rain
like a big storm.

04:38.458 --> 04:40.000
Fill up this lake in no time.

04:40.625 --> 04:43.000
Yes, that would be useful.

04:43.000 --> 04:45.458
Until the dam is ready,
put her in the box.

04:46.000 --> 04:48.125
No! Not in there!

04:50.208 --> 04:52.083
Not in here! No!

04:52.083 --> 04:56.875
Please! Let me out!
Let me out!

04:56.875 --> 04:58.708
[Jubilee]
The ad said, "Fun in the sun."

04:58.708 --> 05:00.583
Let me know when the fun starts.

05:01.500 --> 05:03.125
[grunting]

05:04.125 --> 05:07.208
I just can't stand
to think of her inside that box.

05:08.875 --> 05:12.416
With her claustrophobia,
it must be terrible.

05:12.416 --> 05:13.958
She's alive, petite.

05:14.500 --> 05:16.708
Put your weight into it,
pretty boy!

05:17.500 --> 05:19.625
You! Go break rocks.

05:23.416 --> 05:25.333
Dry that concrete evenly,
Sunfire.

05:25.333 --> 05:26.750
We don't want it to crack.

05:30.416 --> 05:31.875
[explosion]

05:34.000 --> 05:35.000
It's him.

05:45.708 --> 05:47.500
Back to your cells, mutants!

05:50.083 --> 05:53.583
[Leader]
I have decided there will be
no more work today.

05:54.083 --> 05:55.833
Enjoy yourselves.

05:56.875 --> 05:58.291
Keep moving!

05:58.875 --> 06:01.708
[Leader]
Remember,
your Leader loves you.

06:09.958 --> 06:12.958
Remind me never to buy stock
in the Genoshan Phone Company.

06:13.375 --> 06:15.500
Storm grew up
on the streets of Cairo.

06:15.500 --> 06:18.125
I'm sure she can handle
whatever Genosha throws at her

06:18.125 --> 06:19.875
even bad phone service.
[door opens]

06:20.500 --> 06:23.333
Well! Look what the cat drug in.

06:23.333 --> 06:27.708
-I'm back.
-We've been trying to contact
you for days, Wolverine.

06:27.708 --> 06:28.833
Where have you been?

06:29.416 --> 06:30.625
[sneezing]

06:30.625 --> 06:32.083
Somewhere cold.

06:40.500 --> 06:44.583
Some dork at the power company
sure picked a good time
to screw up.

06:45.250 --> 06:48.083
Not that young Jubilee,
X-Woman Supreme

06:48.083 --> 06:49.958
couldn't have handled it anyway.

06:51.958 --> 06:53.375
I am too slick.

06:56.333 --> 06:58.416
-Gambit!
-What are you doing, petite?

06:58.875 --> 07:01.958
-Taking a walk?
-I've got a plan on
how to get out of here.

07:01.958 --> 07:05.250
When they brought us back
to the prison today
we walked right past the goon

07:05.250 --> 07:06.750
who turns the collars
on and off.

07:06.750 --> 07:08.375
If we jump him

07:08.375 --> 07:10.708
we can get the controls
and get our powers back.

07:10.708 --> 07:15.083
-You're going to end up
like Storm, in a box.
-Hey! No way!

07:15.083 --> 07:17.500
They won't expect us
to try anything
right outside the prison.

07:17.500 --> 07:19.250
We'll take them by surprise.

07:19.250 --> 07:21.375
I'll get you out so you can talk
to the others.

07:21.833 --> 07:23.083
This girl I knew
in the orphanage

07:23.083 --> 07:24.833
taught me how to pick locks.

07:25.250 --> 07:27.000
It's your plan. You tell them.

07:27.708 --> 07:29.125
They like you better, anyway.

07:29.583 --> 07:30.583
Now go on, quick...

07:31.333 --> 07:32.375
before the lights come on again.

07:33.000 --> 07:35.166
Yeah. Okay.

07:35.958 --> 07:38.875
Listen, everybody!
I know a way we can all escape!

07:39.375 --> 07:41.625
I've got a plan
on how to rush the guards.

07:41.625 --> 07:45.333
Don't be stupid, kid!
You'll just get us in trouble!

07:45.333 --> 07:46.958
Why risk our lives, girl?

07:47.500 --> 07:49.958
They say they set us free
when the work is done.

07:49.958 --> 07:52.291
Dumb kid! Go to bed!

07:56.125 --> 07:57.125
I think I will!

08:04.625 --> 08:05.875
We're ready to go, Professor.

08:06.583 --> 08:08.625
Are you sure
you won't come with us?

08:08.625 --> 08:11.166
You said yourself,
there's probably no trouble
on Genosha.

08:11.166 --> 08:14.250
Besides, I have some things
I have to do.

08:24.708 --> 08:26.958
[receptionist on phone]
Muir Island
Mutant Research Center.

08:26.958 --> 08:28.458
Moira McTaggart, please.

08:29.125 --> 08:31.375
Tell her it's an old friend.

08:36.875 --> 08:41.083
[Leader]
Mutants of Genosha!
A new day begins!

08:42.375 --> 08:43.458
[Jubilee]
Gambit?

08:44.208 --> 08:45.208
Gambit!

08:46.000 --> 08:47.375
They take him away in the night.

08:48.583 --> 08:50.708
[whispering]
We with you! Just say when!

09:00.208 --> 09:01.333
[Jubilee]
Now!

09:02.166 --> 09:03.291
Come on!

09:07.958 --> 09:09.708
Use your mutant powers!

09:10.583 --> 09:12.000
The collars are still on!

09:18.000 --> 09:19.375
Don't shoot!

09:19.375 --> 09:20.375
It doesn't work!

09:21.125 --> 09:22.291
[Jubilee exclaims]

09:23.250 --> 09:27.375
I have apprehended the leader
of the mutant rebellion.

09:27.375 --> 09:30.291
[Leader]
We were warned by one of their
own kind... a mutant.

09:30.291 --> 09:32.000
It can't be!

09:40.583 --> 09:42.583
[Storm]
Jubilee. Jubilee!

09:42.583 --> 09:45.875
-Storm!
-[Storm] Do not be afraid,
child.

09:46.875 --> 09:50.958
I will make a snowstorm
when the sun rises.

09:50.958 --> 09:52.833
Don't, Storm, please.

09:52.833 --> 09:55.000
You know you don't have
your powers.

09:55.000 --> 09:58.250
Gambit...
Gambit will save us.

10:07.416 --> 10:11.875
Isn't it beautiful, Gyrich?
I call it Mastermold.

10:11.875 --> 10:14.583
Sentinel creation completed.

10:18.750 --> 10:21.625
[Trask]
The manufacturing process
is entirely self-contained.

10:22.250 --> 10:24.958
All it requires is an outside
power source.

10:24.958 --> 10:26.625
[Hodge]
Too much power, Dr. Trask.

10:26.625 --> 10:29.166
You blacked out
half of Genosha last night.

10:29.166 --> 10:31.875
We'll have our own power grid
once the dam is finished.

10:32.458 --> 10:35.458
Then Mastermold's children
will be able to track down
mutants

10:35.458 --> 10:36.833
anywhere on the planet.

10:37.375 --> 10:39.500
Good to see you
again, Colonel.

10:39.500 --> 10:42.375
I am called "Leader" now,
Mr. Gyrich.

10:42.875 --> 10:45.166
Do not forget that.

10:45.166 --> 10:48.583
Cameron Hodge,
development adviser
to the Government of Genosha.

10:48.583 --> 10:51.833
[Leader]
I understand there was a revolt
by the slaves.

10:51.833 --> 10:55.125
We allowed it to happen,
to break their spirit.

10:55.125 --> 10:58.708
You should have seen
their faces when I showed
them who had betrayed them.

10:59.458 --> 11:00.416
[door opens]

11:02.458 --> 11:04.708
He calls himself Gambit.

11:08.875 --> 11:11.291
[Gyrich]
You helped that girl
when the Sentinel tried

11:11.291 --> 11:13.291
to capture her
at Salem Center Mall.

11:13.708 --> 11:16.750
Were you also one of the mutants
who attacked the Sentinel
factory?

11:17.208 --> 11:19.291
They call themselves
the X-Men.

11:19.291 --> 11:20.708
X-Men?

11:20.708 --> 11:22.875
What is so special
about these X-Men?

11:22.875 --> 11:24.458
Where can I find them?

11:24.458 --> 11:27.208
If I tell you,
maybe you don't need me no more.

11:27.208 --> 11:29.708
I think I better just take you
there

11:29.708 --> 11:31.000
whenever you're ready.

11:31.458 --> 11:34.583
Why should I believe
you'll betray your friends

11:34.583 --> 11:36.375
your fellow mutants?

11:36.375 --> 11:37.875
They're not my friends.

11:38.291 --> 11:40.291
They don't like me,
don't trust me.

11:40.291 --> 11:42.875
They're just using me,
like you.

11:42.875 --> 11:45.458
All right.
We'll do it your way.

11:46.291 --> 11:48.416
Take him back to the prison
until we're ready for him.

11:55.250 --> 11:56.958
You want to see a card trick?

12:04.708 --> 12:05.958
[guard]
Stop, mutant!

12:08.000 --> 12:09.250
[guards exclaim]

12:20.375 --> 12:21.458
Uh-uh.

12:22.708 --> 12:25.625
I'm looking for the one
who calls himself "The Leader."

12:26.083 --> 12:28.750
In the factory,
beside the bridge.

12:37.375 --> 12:38.750
Who are you?

12:38.750 --> 12:40.583
The Wild Man of Borneo.

12:41.458 --> 12:44.375
-See you around.
-The Leader has made slaves
of the mutants.

12:45.125 --> 12:47.708
-Will you help me set them free?
-Here.

12:49.375 --> 12:52.500
I took that off one of those
Genoshan goons a week ago.

12:53.000 --> 12:54.583
Maybe you can use it.

12:54.583 --> 12:56.250
[chuckles]

12:56.250 --> 12:57.958
[Gyrich]
Who is this man

12:57.958 --> 13:00.083
the one the Leader
is so afraid of?

13:00.875 --> 13:04.000
[Hodge]
His name is Cable.
An American, apparently.

13:04.625 --> 13:08.000
He was a mercenary
in the Leader's army,
until he found out

13:08.000 --> 13:11.250
the Leader wasn't
the champion of democracy
he claimed to be.

13:11.708 --> 13:14.000
We're not sure,
but we suspect he's a mutant.

13:14.625 --> 13:17.125
So he threw his wages back
in the Leader's face

13:17.125 --> 13:19.625
and took to the hills
to start a revolution.

13:19.625 --> 13:22.958
Cable lives by his code,
but he will not live long.

13:26.375 --> 13:29.000
I always thought
it'd be great to have a sauna.

13:30.708 --> 13:31.875
Storm!

13:34.416 --> 13:36.625
[gasps]
Gambit!

13:40.708 --> 13:42.583
[groaning]

13:42.583 --> 13:45.458
-Quickly, cherie!
-I knew you would rescue us.

13:46.375 --> 13:49.166
You jerk! You made me think
you were a traitor!

13:49.166 --> 13:51.333
Why didn't you tell me
you were just pretending?

13:54.583 --> 13:55.583
Hey!

14:04.000 --> 14:07.458
How do you sweat so much,
petite,and not lose weight?

14:07.458 --> 14:09.291
[exclaims in anger]
I hate you!

14:12.250 --> 14:14.875
The collars you use
to control your mutants.

14:16.125 --> 14:18.875
They were invented
by a scientist in Scotland.

14:19.458 --> 14:20.583
A true genius.

14:21.250 --> 14:23.250
[Gyrich]
Could I get them
in large numbers?

14:23.250 --> 14:25.208
How much is it worth to you

14:25.208 --> 14:28.333
to have that man, Cable,
eliminated?

14:28.333 --> 14:30.083
[Leader]
How much can you pay?

14:30.083 --> 14:31.750
When the dam is completed

14:31.750 --> 14:34.708
we'll have the power to create
thousands of Sentinels.

14:35.166 --> 14:38.083
Your Sentinels make you
a hard man to refuse.

14:38.708 --> 14:40.083
Your Leadership!

14:40.083 --> 14:41.708
Three of the mutants
have escaped!

14:41.708 --> 14:43.583
The one called
Gambit freed them!

14:43.583 --> 14:45.333
I knew he
couldn't be trusted!

14:45.333 --> 14:46.875
[all screaming]

15:03.833 --> 15:07.000
In line, mutants.
No more work today.

15:12.458 --> 15:13.500
[guard 1]
No!

15:27.208 --> 15:28.250
[groans]

15:32.250 --> 15:33.708
[Gambit]
MonsieurSentinel!

15:36.416 --> 15:37.500
Imminent danger.

15:39.250 --> 15:41.083
Initiate booster rocket...

15:41.083 --> 15:42.291
Blast that mutant!

15:43.583 --> 15:44.875
Mind if I borrow this?

15:51.458 --> 15:52.875
[Sunfire]
We can use our powers!

15:53.291 --> 15:54.333
[guard 2]
The mutants are free!

16:06.500 --> 16:08.458
[guards exclaiming]

16:24.291 --> 16:26.458
Happy landings, goon!

16:26.458 --> 16:29.333
Stop! You must not harm him!

16:30.000 --> 16:32.083
[commander screaming]

16:38.375 --> 16:41.291
Now that you're free,
you can help us stop
the Sentinels.

16:41.291 --> 16:44.375
No! We follow you once before,
to disaster.

16:44.375 --> 16:47.166
Gambit has seen
how the Sentinels are created.

16:47.166 --> 16:49.250
There will be thousands of them

16:49.250 --> 16:51.375
unless this dam is destroyed.

16:51.375 --> 16:54.875
We deal with the Sentinels
when all of Genosha is ours.

16:55.583 --> 16:56.583
Come on!

16:59.208 --> 17:00.833
Give me that key.

17:00.833 --> 17:03.500
You could at least say
thank you!

17:03.500 --> 17:06.416
This dam's too big for us
to bring down, non?

17:06.416 --> 17:09.375
[Storm]
Yes, but a power greater
than ours

17:09.375 --> 17:11.375
lies hidden within the clouds.

17:13.875 --> 17:16.333
[Gyrich]
This whole situation
is collapsing.

17:16.333 --> 17:18.625
I'm going back to Washington.

17:18.625 --> 17:20.708
Gyrich!
You're not going to abandon me!

17:26.833 --> 17:27.833
Halt!

17:41.250 --> 17:42.708
[thunder rumbling]

17:42.708 --> 17:44.125
Take me to my car at once.

17:46.083 --> 17:47.583
The other way, you fool!

17:50.583 --> 17:52.333
Remember me, Colonel?

18:02.708 --> 18:05.583
Please, Storm!
You're not strong enough yet!

18:08.750 --> 18:09.875
Leave me!

18:10.375 --> 18:13.125
Come, petite!
We've got to let her be.

18:13.125 --> 18:14.208
No!

18:16.458 --> 18:21.708
I summon the full power
of the storm!

18:30.875 --> 18:32.583
[groaning]

18:37.416 --> 18:39.166
You've been working too hard,
gal.

18:48.000 --> 18:51.000
Have you ever been
to Switzerland, Mr. Hodge?

18:51.000 --> 18:52.166
[Hodge gasps]

19:07.000 --> 19:08.708
[guard screams]

19:09.333 --> 19:11.875
[Cable]
I thought you were going to
bring democracy to Genosha.

19:12.500 --> 19:17.166
I don't mind being wrong,
as long as I can
correct my mistakes.

19:17.166 --> 19:20.000
Drop that plasma rifle
or I'll fire!

19:20.000 --> 19:23.000
Blast him, Hodge! Now!

19:23.000 --> 19:24.583
[rumbling]

19:27.875 --> 19:28.875
[screams]

19:40.000 --> 19:41.958
[Mastermold]
I am still plugged in!

20:03.375 --> 20:05.458
Cyclops to Xavier.
Come in, Professor.

20:08.500 --> 20:10.166
There's no answer. Just static.

20:15.708 --> 20:16.833
[gasps]

20:16.833 --> 20:18.500
It's all right, Storm.

20:18.500 --> 20:21.583
I dreamed I was
in a very small place.

20:22.625 --> 20:24.291
I'm sorry I didn't trust you,
Gambit.

20:24.833 --> 20:27.708
I mean, I should've known
you'd never really be a traitor.

20:27.708 --> 20:29.583
How do you know that,
petite?

20:29.583 --> 20:32.083
Maybe you been fooled again,
non?

20:32.083 --> 20:35.250
Touchdown in two minutes.
I'm getting a visual on the...

20:35.250 --> 20:36.333
the school!

20:36.333 --> 20:37.833
It can't be!

20:37.833 --> 20:38.833
[growling]

20:46.125 --> 20:48.000
[closing theme music playing]
