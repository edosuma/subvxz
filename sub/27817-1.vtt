01:43.983 --> 01:46.820
Oh, see you
in the choir
on Sunday!

02:32.298 --> 02:33.799
Hi, Mike.

03:40.266 --> 03:41.234
Hello?

03:41.267 --> 03:42.235
Hi.

03:42.268 --> 03:43.236
Oh, hi.

03:43.269 --> 03:44.938
Been home long?

03:44.971 --> 03:47.941
No. I just got back
from the store.

03:47.974 --> 03:49.943
We're looking forward
to tonight.

03:49.976 --> 03:51.244
Can I bring anything?

03:51.277 --> 03:53.246
I think I have
everything.

03:53.279 --> 03:54.447
Well, if there's
anything--

03:54.480 --> 03:56.249
wait.
There is something.

03:56.282 --> 03:58.251
Do you have any
champagne glasses?

03:58.284 --> 04:00.253
I thought we'd start
with champagne.

04:00.286 --> 04:01.454
We have some.

04:01.487 --> 04:02.655
Do you have eight?

04:02.688 --> 04:04.557
No. We have six.

04:04.590 --> 04:07.626
Bring them.
Mitch and I will drink
from jelly glasses.

04:07.660 --> 04:09.328
You're going
to such trouble.

04:09.362 --> 04:13.066
I always go to lots of
trouble for a dinner party.

04:13.099 --> 04:14.367
I've got to run.

04:14.400 --> 04:16.069
See you
around 8:00. Bye.

04:16.101 --> 04:17.036
Bye.

04:31.350 --> 04:33.953
Look at this floor.

04:33.987 --> 04:37.290
I thought you love
chocolate chip cookies.

04:37.323 --> 04:39.625
Where's that book
I gave you?

04:45.364 --> 04:47.967
When I was a little girl,

04:48.001 --> 04:49.969
this was my favorite book.

04:51.637 --> 04:54.140
Which one was
your favorite story?

04:54.173 --> 04:56.075
What difference
does it make?

04:56.109 --> 04:58.344
Let me out of here! Help!

04:58.377 --> 05:00.079
It's been so long,

05:00.113 --> 05:02.015
I almost
can't remember them.

05:02.048 --> 05:03.282
Help! Let me out!

05:03.316 --> 05:05.384
What are you doing?

05:05.418 --> 05:07.353
Just preheating
to 350.

05:07.386 --> 05:10.123
Help! Help! There's
a crazy woman here!

05:10.156 --> 05:12.191
She's going to cook me!

05:12.225 --> 05:14.193
She's going
to eat me! Help!

05:14.227 --> 05:16.662
I never could do
long division.

05:16.695 --> 05:18.031
Let's see.

05:18.064 --> 05:22.201
How many times
does 12 go into 75?

05:22.235 --> 05:25.204
Oh...6 times,
3 left over.

05:25.238 --> 05:26.405
Why?

05:26.439 --> 05:29.075
Well, at 12 minutes
a pound,

05:29.108 --> 05:32.078
that means you have
to be in the oven

05:32.111 --> 05:35.048
by no later than...

05:35.081 --> 05:36.482
1:30.

05:36.515 --> 05:37.750
Oh...

05:37.783 --> 05:40.619
But evisceration takes
at least an hour.

05:42.788 --> 05:44.157
Evisceration?

05:44.190 --> 05:45.358
What's that?

05:45.391 --> 05:47.360
It's like gutting a fish.

05:47.393 --> 05:49.528
First you make
a long slit,

05:49.562 --> 05:51.697
then remove everything
that isn't meat--

05:51.730 --> 05:55.068
the heart, the lungs,
the intestines, and so forth.

05:55.101 --> 05:58.071
Then you fill it back up
with stuffing,

05:58.104 --> 06:00.773
sew it back together
with one of these.

06:04.243 --> 06:06.379
Maybe I should
get started now.

06:06.412 --> 06:08.314
Wait. There's
plenty of time.

06:08.347 --> 06:10.316
This was
your favorite book.

06:10.349 --> 06:12.685
Don't you want
to hear a story?

06:12.718 --> 06:14.053
A love story?

06:14.087 --> 06:15.521
Yeah!
Well, not really.

06:15.554 --> 06:17.490
But it's a really
good one.

06:17.523 --> 06:19.092
You'll like it
a lot.

06:19.125 --> 06:20.393
Here.

06:20.426 --> 06:22.695
It's about these
guys in college.

06:22.728 --> 06:25.198
They live
in the same dorm.

06:25.231 --> 06:27.700
And one of them's
kind of poor,

06:27.733 --> 06:30.703
so he works his way
through school
selling things.

06:30.736 --> 06:32.271
Hey!

06:32.305 --> 06:33.806
Be careful with that.

06:33.839 --> 06:35.674
His name's bellingham,

06:35.708 --> 06:37.510
and he collects antiques.

06:37.543 --> 06:39.078
Well, one day,

06:39.112 --> 06:42.315
bellingham got
a very special delivery.

06:42.348 --> 06:45.251
Meanwhile, the other guys--
Andy and Lee--

06:45.284 --> 06:46.785
they were real rich.

06:46.819 --> 06:49.788
And they did something
very nasty to bellingham.

06:49.822 --> 06:51.790
Lee, the most work
you've done

06:51.824 --> 06:53.792
in four years
of college

06:53.826 --> 06:57.296
is filling out that
application for the
penrose fellowship.

06:57.330 --> 06:58.464
Hey...

06:58.497 --> 07:00.499
Hard work pays off,
Andy,

07:00.533 --> 07:02.268
especially when
you have a girlfriend

07:02.301 --> 07:04.103
who can write
award-winning essays

07:04.137 --> 07:08.807
about why I want to spend
the summer traveling Europe.

07:08.841 --> 07:11.510
I suppose my sister's
pretty smart.

07:11.544 --> 07:13.512
She's just not
very honest.

07:13.546 --> 07:15.814
I don't see why
you'd risk it.

07:15.848 --> 07:18.684
If they learn
she wrote the proposal
for you,

07:18.717 --> 07:20.519
they'll kick you out.

07:20.553 --> 07:23.522
Your family sends you
to Europe every summer
anyway,

07:23.556 --> 07:24.523
so I don't understand.

07:24.557 --> 07:25.858
Ah.

07:25.891 --> 07:28.827
But this way I have
the fellowship money

07:28.861 --> 07:30.829
to bring back
a Maserati.

07:33.766 --> 07:35.168
Maserati.

07:36.435 --> 07:37.770
Guess who was
my main competitor

07:37.803 --> 07:39.772
for the penrose.

07:39.805 --> 07:42.775
You know bellingham
works part-time
at the university museum.

07:42.808 --> 07:45.278
Where Susan does
volunteer work. I know.

07:45.311 --> 07:47.580
You better hope
he doesn't find out

07:47.613 --> 07:49.615
she helped you screw him
out of that fellowship.

07:49.648 --> 07:52.685
Bellingham has
the hots for Susan.

07:52.718 --> 07:54.853
Don't worry.
We'll be fine.

07:54.887 --> 07:56.189
Ah, Andy.

07:58.257 --> 08:00.226
Ah, Edward.

08:00.259 --> 08:01.727
How you doing?

08:01.760 --> 08:04.297
You going
to introduce me
to your friend?

08:04.330 --> 08:05.398
Uh, yeah.

08:05.431 --> 08:06.432
This is--

08:06.465 --> 08:07.766
Lee...monckton,
right?

08:07.800 --> 08:08.934
Yeah.

08:08.967 --> 08:11.537
Yeah. I, uh,
saw your picture

08:11.570 --> 08:13.572
in our illustrious
college newspaper.

08:13.606 --> 08:14.740
Congratulations.

08:14.773 --> 08:16.809
Oh...thank you.

08:16.842 --> 08:19.345
It's an
odd coincidence,
us meeting,

08:19.378 --> 08:20.813
since we're
in competition

08:20.846 --> 08:22.481
for the penrose
fellowship.

08:22.515 --> 08:24.183
Oh, wait, wait.
You said it.

08:24.217 --> 08:25.784
Competition.
Somebody...

08:25.818 --> 08:27.486
Has to win, you know.

08:27.520 --> 08:29.388
Not always
the better man.

08:36.595 --> 08:38.597
Oh, no, no, no, no.

08:38.631 --> 08:39.765
Allow me.

08:43.936 --> 08:45.371
Hey, thanks.

08:45.404 --> 08:47.773
That lot 249
was a heavy mother.

08:51.710 --> 08:53.646
You'll get your money
back tomorrow.

08:53.679 --> 08:54.813
Oh, there's no rush.

08:54.847 --> 08:55.981
Uh...

08:56.014 --> 08:57.883
I'll tell you what,
Edward.

08:57.916 --> 09:00.886
Just show us
what you have in there,

09:00.919 --> 09:03.956
and my friend here
will write it off.

09:06.859 --> 09:07.893
All right.

09:11.830 --> 09:13.899
If lot 249 lives up
to my expectations,

09:13.932 --> 09:16.769
it won't matter
that I was cheated
out of the penrose.

09:16.802 --> 09:18.304
Cheated?

09:18.337 --> 09:19.938
Something
unfortunate
happened to me

09:19.972 --> 09:21.340
before
the committee

09:21.374 --> 09:22.608
announced
its decision.

09:22.641 --> 09:24.510
What?

09:24.543 --> 09:25.978
I was accused
of stealing

09:26.011 --> 09:29.582
a pre-columbian zuni fetish
from the museum.

09:29.615 --> 09:30.816
Well...

09:30.849 --> 09:32.285
Did you?

09:33.852 --> 09:35.921
I loathe zuni aesthetics.

09:35.954 --> 09:38.624
But by the time
I was cleared,

09:38.657 --> 09:40.959
the committee decided
in your favor.

09:40.993 --> 09:42.328
Oh.

09:42.361 --> 09:44.930
Well, who was it
that accused you?

09:44.963 --> 09:47.866
It was
an anonymous tip.

09:47.900 --> 09:49.268
Oh!

09:51.837 --> 09:53.939
I should probably
get going.

09:53.972 --> 09:55.874
Susan's waiting
at home for me.

09:55.908 --> 09:57.343
Absolutely not.

09:59.612 --> 10:00.946
You're not leaving here

10:00.979 --> 10:03.649
until you see
what's inside lot 249.

10:03.682 --> 10:04.850
That was the deal.

10:18.564 --> 10:21.600
Edward, why would
you buy something
like this?

10:21.634 --> 10:25.037
I wasn't born with a silver
trust fund in my mouth.

10:25.070 --> 10:28.374
You--you can
actually sell this
to somebody...

10:28.407 --> 10:29.875
For a profit?

10:29.908 --> 10:32.978
What else
would I sell it for?

10:34.447 --> 10:35.781
Give me a hand.

10:44.890 --> 10:46.492
My...

10:46.525 --> 10:47.793
God, Andy,

10:47.826 --> 10:50.863
it looks just like
your father.

10:50.896 --> 10:52.865
Ew!

10:52.898 --> 10:57.370
It stinks like
rotten flowers.

10:57.403 --> 11:00.539
Let's see
if the embalmers
did him any justice.

11:00.573 --> 11:01.840
You're going
to unwrap it?

11:01.874 --> 11:02.941
Why not?

11:02.975 --> 11:04.543
All you're
looking at

11:04.577 --> 11:07.380
is 3,000 years
of dry rot.

11:07.413 --> 11:09.815
I'm going to be late.
I'm going to...

11:09.848 --> 11:11.016
I'll show you out.

11:12.551 --> 11:14.086
See you later, Andy?

11:14.119 --> 11:15.854
Yeah.

11:33.506 --> 11:36.141
4, 5, over.

11:36.174 --> 11:38.644
6. Two more.

11:40.413 --> 11:41.647
You're back early.

11:41.680 --> 11:44.483
We quit after two sets.

11:44.517 --> 11:47.820
Sounds like we lost
to Andy again.

11:47.853 --> 11:50.956
Do you know what
your brother
is doing

11:50.989 --> 11:52.958
right now
as we speak?

11:52.991 --> 11:54.159
Huh?

11:54.192 --> 11:56.695
He's unwrapping
a mummy!

11:56.729 --> 11:59.865
With
Edward fucking
bellingham!

11:59.898 --> 12:01.767
How much did
you tell Andy?

12:01.800 --> 12:03.001
Uh...

12:03.035 --> 12:06.439
That--that--that
you wrote the essay.

12:06.472 --> 12:08.006
Oh.

12:08.040 --> 12:09.508
Well, that's okay.

12:09.542 --> 12:12.511
He knows I do
all your papers
anyway.

12:12.545 --> 12:13.579
Oh, and then--and then,

12:13.612 --> 12:16.582
bellingham
casually mentioned

12:16.615 --> 12:20.819
that someone dropped
an anonymous tip
about the stolen...

12:20.853 --> 12:23.088
Pre-columbian
zuni fetish?

12:23.121 --> 12:24.823
He's guessing.

12:24.857 --> 12:28.794
Well, maybe,
but I think Andy
knows it was you.

12:28.827 --> 12:30.095
Andy's my brother.

12:30.128 --> 12:32.598
He won't do anything.

12:32.631 --> 12:34.800
And bellingham's
a loser.

12:34.833 --> 12:36.869
He can't do anything.

12:43.842 --> 12:46.812
I've really got to
get ready for dinner.

12:46.845 --> 12:49.948
Don't you want
to see his face?

12:49.982 --> 12:51.584
No. Thank you.

13:17.810 --> 13:20.112
He looks pissed off.

13:20.145 --> 13:21.947
Like he's thinking.

13:21.980 --> 13:23.716
He's not thinking
anything.

13:23.749 --> 13:25.751
The first thing
the embalmers did

13:25.784 --> 13:28.487
was stick a hook
up his nose,

13:28.521 --> 13:30.989
then drag his brain out
through his nostrils.

13:39.798 --> 13:43.802
Here's where
they cut him open
to remove his innards.

13:43.836 --> 13:48.006
Then they stuff him
with flowers and spices.

13:48.040 --> 13:49.742
Here, hold this open.

13:51.043 --> 13:52.978
Come on,
hold this open.

13:57.115 --> 13:58.517
Ohh.

14:02.755 --> 14:04.189
Myrrh.

14:04.222 --> 14:05.558
Cassia.

14:13.632 --> 14:15.100
Onions.

14:18.804 --> 14:19.938
And...

14:23.776 --> 14:25.210
What?
Onions and what?

14:26.745 --> 14:28.246
A fortune cookie.

14:47.733 --> 14:49.034
What does it say?

14:51.169 --> 14:52.304
Uh...

14:52.337 --> 14:54.139
I have no idea.

14:54.172 --> 14:57.743
Do you know how
to read third kingdom
hieroglyphics?

15:12.658 --> 15:16.061
You're taking
those books back
to the library now?

15:16.094 --> 15:17.630
They're three months
overdue.

15:17.663 --> 15:20.265
And I thought I'd
stop by to see Andy

15:20.298 --> 15:22.635
on the way home.

15:22.668 --> 15:25.638
You don't care about
those books or Andy.

15:25.671 --> 15:27.673
You're going to
go see bellingham.

15:27.706 --> 15:29.775
I give him a hard-on.

15:29.808 --> 15:32.778
I'll talk to him,
throw him off the track.

15:41.319 --> 15:43.656
Zuni fetish.

15:45.290 --> 15:46.625
Hmm.

16:03.275 --> 16:05.744
They use their
second timeout.

16:05.778 --> 16:07.245
I've never
seen Johnny

16:07.279 --> 16:09.247
so enraged by
a defensive play.

16:09.281 --> 16:11.750
He's arguing at
the scorer's table.

16:11.784 --> 16:13.752
They call
a technical
on Scott!

16:17.322 --> 16:19.224
"Grow, o light.

16:19.257 --> 16:21.259
"Come forth, o light.

16:21.293 --> 16:22.928
"Rise, o light.

16:22.961 --> 16:24.697
"Ascend, o light.

16:24.730 --> 16:27.800
"O darkness, remove thyself
from before him.

16:27.833 --> 16:29.301
"Open his eyes.

16:29.334 --> 16:31.937
That bastard can
read that scroll.

16:31.970 --> 16:33.438
"Open, tat.

16:33.471 --> 16:35.107
"Open, nap.

16:35.140 --> 16:37.409
"Open his eyes.

16:37.442 --> 16:40.879
"O darkness, remove thyself
from before him.

16:40.913 --> 16:43.081
"Open his eyes.

16:43.115 --> 16:45.017
"The eater of shadows,

16:45.050 --> 16:47.085
"the eater of souls,

16:47.119 --> 16:49.221
"open his eyes.

16:49.254 --> 16:50.856
"Open, tat.

16:50.889 --> 16:52.257
"Open, nap.

16:52.290 --> 16:54.659
Open his eyes."

16:58.363 --> 16:59.998
Oh, jeez!

17:02.067 --> 17:03.869
Hey, bellingham!

17:06.204 --> 17:07.940
Hey, bellingham, come on.

17:07.973 --> 17:10.843
The fuse box is
right outside your door.

17:21.118 --> 17:22.119
Christ.

17:24.521 --> 17:27.992
Come on, bellingham.
It's the end
of the playoffs.

17:28.026 --> 17:29.694
I mean, Christ.

17:33.999 --> 17:34.900
Oh.

17:34.933 --> 17:36.701
God.

17:38.170 --> 17:39.204
Hey.

17:39.237 --> 17:40.739
You okay?

17:40.773 --> 17:41.907
Yeah.

17:41.940 --> 17:42.908
Aah!

17:43.942 --> 17:45.110
Jesus!

17:49.014 --> 17:51.984
What the hell
are you doing here?

17:52.017 --> 17:54.987
I just--i just
thought I'd stop by.

17:55.020 --> 17:57.990
What's going on?
Somebody just
knocked me down.

17:58.023 --> 18:00.292
Look, you two
just wait here.

18:00.325 --> 18:01.493
Don't go after him!

18:01.526 --> 18:03.295
Go after who?

18:03.328 --> 18:04.997
Um...

18:05.030 --> 18:06.264
A thief.

18:25.818 --> 18:27.152
Damn fuses.

18:28.353 --> 18:30.823
Well...

18:30.856 --> 18:32.891
He couldn't
have taken much.

18:34.592 --> 18:36.494
Would you like
some Brandy?

18:36.528 --> 18:38.063
Thank you.

19:02.855 --> 19:04.990
Did you see him?

19:05.023 --> 19:07.459
No.

19:07.492 --> 19:10.462
Not really,
but he did look
a little weird.

19:10.495 --> 19:12.464
Yes, he was very weird.

19:12.497 --> 19:13.866
He must've been on drugs.

19:13.899 --> 19:15.300
Got off
with my rings.

19:15.333 --> 19:18.170
Roman stuff.
Hollow gold.

19:18.203 --> 19:21.373
At least
he didn't get away
with lot 249.

21:11.516 --> 21:13.185
Aah!

21:25.363 --> 21:26.931
No!

21:28.133 --> 21:29.234
No!

21:29.267 --> 21:30.535
No!

21:30.568 --> 21:32.971
No!

22:10.808 --> 22:12.177
Lee!

22:12.210 --> 22:13.345
Lee!

22:31.229 --> 22:32.730
* ...With me

22:32.764 --> 22:35.200
* that's the way
a heart breaks *

22:35.233 --> 22:37.202
* and every man
must pay the price *

22:37.235 --> 22:39.771
* that's the way
a heart breaks *

22:39.804 --> 22:43.808
* you stand
before the gates
of paradise *

22:43.841 --> 22:47.545
* of fire
and ice **

23:00.625 --> 23:01.793
Shit.

23:14.572 --> 23:15.807
This better be important.

23:15.840 --> 23:17.475
Need any help, bill?

23:17.509 --> 23:20.378
No. It's a mess,
but we got it covered.

23:22.480 --> 23:24.149
Andy.

23:24.182 --> 23:25.550
You busy?

23:31.456 --> 23:33.825
Guess I could
use this, huh?

23:40.798 --> 23:43.435
I lied to the police.

23:43.468 --> 23:45.837
I saw who did it.

23:45.870 --> 23:46.738
What?

23:48.740 --> 23:51.443
I saw who
killed Lee.

23:53.211 --> 23:54.812
He was thin...

23:54.846 --> 23:56.748
And filthy...

23:56.781 --> 23:58.516
And stinking.

23:58.550 --> 24:00.485
Like rotten flowers.

24:01.753 --> 24:04.222
Lot 249.

24:04.256 --> 24:06.124
Very few thieves

24:06.158 --> 24:08.593
would have the discernment
to realize

24:08.626 --> 24:11.329
that this was
one of the museum's

24:11.363 --> 24:13.298
most unusual pieces.

24:15.200 --> 24:18.303
Susan Smith
stole that fetish
and planted it here.

24:18.336 --> 24:20.605
Oh, my.

24:20.638 --> 24:23.375
What a sensual
candlestick.

24:24.409 --> 24:26.211
Take your hands off that.

24:27.679 --> 24:29.214
Good evening,
Mr. Smith.

24:29.247 --> 24:30.282
Dean Murray.

24:30.315 --> 24:32.617
Andy, do you
know Dr. Carey,

24:32.650 --> 24:34.686
the curator of
the university museum?

24:34.719 --> 24:36.221
Uh...

24:36.254 --> 24:37.322
Hi.

24:39.491 --> 24:40.758
What's going on,
Edward?

24:40.792 --> 24:43.728
I'm a little busy
right now, Andy.

24:43.761 --> 24:44.929
Yes.

24:44.962 --> 24:47.165
Mr. Bellingham
is packing.

24:47.199 --> 24:49.234
He's leaving
the university.

24:49.267 --> 24:50.134
Oh!

24:51.869 --> 24:53.205
Pity.

24:53.238 --> 24:55.507
Would have been
a nice acquisition

24:55.540 --> 24:57.842
if the mummy
had come with it.

25:00.312 --> 25:01.879
What happened
to the mummy?

25:18.696 --> 25:21.266
He never did have taste.

25:25.370 --> 25:27.639
I don't care how cheap
the psychology is.

25:27.672 --> 25:31.309
I still hate these
stupid chrysanthemums.

25:52.330 --> 25:53.765
I'm aware of that,
operator.

25:53.798 --> 25:56.701
I've been trying to get
through for a half hour.

25:57.769 --> 25:59.704
Help!

25:59.737 --> 26:00.872
Police!

26:00.905 --> 26:03.508
Please, somebody help me!

26:03.541 --> 26:04.809
Aah!

26:04.842 --> 26:06.311
Aah!

26:06.344 --> 26:08.713
Aah!

26:23.795 --> 26:25.430
Susan!

26:25.463 --> 26:26.631
Susan!

26:32.404 --> 26:33.838
Jesus.

26:39.644 --> 26:41.012
Jesus.

27:04.936 --> 27:06.404
Damned fuses.

27:27.792 --> 27:29.327
Hey!

27:50.081 --> 27:52.650
Oh, you're awake.

27:56.688 --> 27:57.855
That's my master's
thesis.

27:57.889 --> 27:59.557
What are you doing?

28:01.759 --> 28:04.929
Well, I'm going to
start a little fire
under your chair

28:04.962 --> 28:06.698
and roast your nuts.

28:07.699 --> 28:08.800
Why?

28:08.833 --> 28:11.436
Because you
killed my sister

28:11.469 --> 28:12.637
and my best friend.

28:12.670 --> 28:13.571
That's why.

28:13.605 --> 28:15.473
I didn't kill them.

28:15.507 --> 28:18.910
Right. Right.
Your friend lot 249 did.

28:23.080 --> 28:27.018
Ah. I thought
he'd be back.

28:27.051 --> 28:30.388
The alleged
perpetrator's got
an airtight alibi.

28:30.422 --> 28:33.891
He's been dead
for 3,000 years.

28:33.925 --> 28:36.928
Then these should make
for excellent kindling.

28:42.600 --> 28:44.902
Oh, Andy, you're crazy.

28:47.204 --> 28:50.074
Ooh, damn, I think
I forgot my matches.

28:52.143 --> 28:53.911
Grow, grow, o light.

28:53.945 --> 28:55.880
Ascend, o light.

28:55.913 --> 28:58.149
Rise, o light.
Come forth, o light.

28:58.182 --> 29:00.685
O darkness, remove...

29:00.718 --> 29:02.720
Re--shit, how does it go?

29:02.754 --> 29:04.456
Remove thyself from them.

29:04.489 --> 29:06.057
Open, tat. Open, nap.

29:06.090 --> 29:08.560
Open his eyes.

29:08.593 --> 29:10.862
Open his eyes.
Open--

29:10.895 --> 29:11.996
Edward,

29:12.029 --> 29:14.499
I believe
in being prepared.

29:14.532 --> 29:15.867
Eh?

29:15.900 --> 29:19.036
Batteries in case
those fuses blow again.

29:29.947 --> 29:32.750
Need a hand up there,
fella? Huh?

29:37.154 --> 29:38.623
Jesus.

29:51.936 --> 29:53.104
Edward...

29:53.137 --> 29:55.172
I'm not going
to apologize

29:55.206 --> 29:58.543
for what Lee and Susan
did to you.

29:58.576 --> 30:01.913
I won't call the cops either,
because what sane person

30:01.946 --> 30:05.016
would believe that
a 3,000-year-old mummy

30:05.049 --> 30:08.052
really did come
back to life anyway?

30:08.085 --> 30:10.555
But I do have another idea.

30:52.229 --> 30:55.099
Well, that takes care
of that, doesn't it?

31:06.010 --> 31:08.179
Would you untie me,
please?

31:11.015 --> 31:12.684
Yeah, of course.

31:12.717 --> 31:16.588
As soon as you tell me
where the scroll is.

31:16.621 --> 31:18.656
You don't need
the scroll.

31:18.690 --> 31:21.158
It only worked
for that mummy,

31:21.192 --> 31:22.827
which you've
totally destroyed.

31:34.205 --> 31:37.875
The second drawer
in the desk
on the right.

32:06.337 --> 32:08.205
It's irreplaceable.

32:08.239 --> 32:10.642
Yeah,
I certainly hope so.

32:17.148 --> 32:19.884
That scroll
would have made
my entire career.

32:21.919 --> 32:25.857
My sister and my best friend
died because of this.

32:25.890 --> 32:29.827
Killing me won't
bring them back.

32:29.861 --> 32:33.731
If I let you live,
that will> bring them back?

32:44.876 --> 32:46.744
Don't worry, Andy.

32:46.778 --> 32:49.814
You'll never
see me again.

32:49.847 --> 32:52.917
But I'll find a way
to keep in touch.

32:54.218 --> 32:55.853
Open, tat.
Open, nap.

32:55.887 --> 32:59.256
Bind them both
to my service

32:59.290 --> 33:03.027
and to the gods
of death, terror,

33:03.060 --> 33:05.296
and revenge.

33:05.329 --> 33:07.732
Ha ha ha!

33:07.765 --> 33:09.934
Hey, man, what's so
fucking funny?

33:12.704 --> 33:14.371
I was just thinking
of this guy I know.

33:14.405 --> 33:17.374
Couldn't distinguish
a third dynasty
sacred scroll

33:17.408 --> 33:21.412
from a piece
of post-alexandrian
pictogram porn.

33:24.448 --> 33:25.950
Ha ha ha!

33:25.983 --> 33:28.886
Ha ha ha!

33:28.920 --> 33:32.656
Mom, I'll be home as soon
as finals are over.

33:33.958 --> 33:36.894
Yeah, the funeral
was hard on me, too.

33:38.963 --> 33:41.899
No, the police don't
have any leads yet.

33:41.933 --> 33:42.934
All right?

33:42.967 --> 33:45.036
I'll see you
next week.

33:45.069 --> 33:46.203
Bye.

33:50.441 --> 33:52.276
Andy?

33:56.781 --> 33:59.817
Bellingham
sends his regards.

34:02.186 --> 34:05.056
Antiques
are so fascinating.

34:05.089 --> 34:07.058
You told that
very well.

34:07.091 --> 34:08.292
Thank you.

34:08.324 --> 34:10.161
Goodness,
it's almost 1:00.

34:10.194 --> 34:12.396
We've got to
get things started.

34:12.429 --> 34:14.098
You know, if I'm
not home by 6:00,

34:14.130 --> 34:15.800
they'll come looking.

34:21.304 --> 34:24.041
Looking for what,
dear?

34:24.074 --> 34:25.909
Uh...wait.

34:25.943 --> 34:27.378
I'll tell you
another story.

34:27.411 --> 34:28.780
Put the book away.

34:28.813 --> 34:30.782
But it's the best
story yet.

34:30.815 --> 34:33.851
I stopped reading twice
because I got scared.

34:33.885 --> 34:36.487
It's about the old man
who's so rich

34:36.520 --> 34:39.924
and lives in this
big house all by himself.

34:39.956 --> 34:42.193
Okay. This'll be
the last story,

34:42.226 --> 34:44.428
and you have to
make it quick.

34:44.460 --> 34:46.831
I will. I promise.

34:46.864 --> 34:49.500
It's about
this old man
named drogan.

34:49.533 --> 34:52.436
Old man drogan
had this big problem,

34:52.469 --> 34:55.371
so he hired this man
to help him...

34:55.406 --> 34:58.075
A very
professional man.

35:27.905 --> 35:29.874
It's already
taken care of, pal.

35:29.907 --> 35:31.208
Here,
Mr. Halston.

35:31.242 --> 35:32.543
Here!

35:32.576 --> 35:36.013
You are Mr. Halston,
aren't you?

35:36.881 --> 35:38.149
That's me.

35:38.182 --> 35:39.917
Tell the driver
to wait.

35:42.386 --> 35:45.056
The man says
you should wait.

35:45.089 --> 35:47.892
For what this guy's paying,
I ain't going nowhere.

35:47.925 --> 35:49.894
Take your time.

36:04.942 --> 36:06.543
In here,
Mr. Halston.

36:06.577 --> 36:07.945
In here.

36:22.593 --> 36:25.462
I want you
to make a hit.

36:25.496 --> 36:28.565
That is what you do,
I understand.

36:28.599 --> 36:31.068
How did you
get my name?

36:31.102 --> 36:33.604
A Mr. Saul loggia

36:33.637 --> 36:35.907
told me
that you know him.

36:37.441 --> 36:39.410
Who do you
want hit?

36:39.443 --> 36:43.714
Your victim
is right behind you.

36:49.987 --> 36:52.256
I ought to
kill you for that.

36:52.289 --> 36:53.925
I don't like jokes.

36:53.958 --> 36:55.292
I don't make jokes.

36:55.326 --> 36:56.593
Sit down.

36:56.627 --> 36:57.561
Here.

37:01.465 --> 37:03.667
Sit down,
Mr. Halston,

37:03.700 --> 37:05.569
and look in
that envelope.

37:18.649 --> 37:21.252
$50,000.

37:21.285 --> 37:24.088
There will be
another 50,000

37:24.121 --> 37:26.090
when you
bring me proof

37:26.123 --> 37:29.326
that the cat has
ended its time on earth.

37:29.360 --> 37:30.995
I don't believe this.

37:31.028 --> 37:34.031
You're hiring me
to kill a cat?

37:34.065 --> 37:37.568
That cat has
killed three people

37:37.601 --> 37:39.470
in this household.

37:39.503 --> 37:40.972
That leaves me.

37:42.606 --> 37:44.508
I need not
explain anything,

37:44.541 --> 37:46.077
but I will.

37:46.110 --> 37:49.580
In fact,
I feel the need
to justify myself

37:49.613 --> 37:51.983
so you won't
think me mad.

37:58.389 --> 38:00.357
This is
quite a mansion,

38:00.391 --> 38:02.359
don't you think,
Mr. Halston?

38:02.393 --> 38:03.961
Quite a mansion.

38:05.162 --> 38:06.330
Help me up.

38:10.467 --> 38:12.136
Over the years

38:12.169 --> 38:15.106
I filled this place
with everything,

38:15.139 --> 38:16.607
everything
you could want,

38:16.640 --> 38:19.310
everything
you could ever want.

38:22.146 --> 38:25.516
There used to be
four of us living here--

38:26.650 --> 38:28.152
myself

38:28.185 --> 38:30.121
and Carolyn broadmoor,

38:30.154 --> 38:35.126
the only friend
of my sister Amanda.

38:37.161 --> 38:39.630
And Richard Gage,
a hired man

38:39.663 --> 38:42.299
with the family
almost 20 years.

38:43.567 --> 38:47.438
We were
a dull collection

38:47.471 --> 38:50.141
of rich, old,
unhappy people.

38:54.811 --> 38:56.313
Then...

38:56.347 --> 38:58.049
The cat came.

39:02.186 --> 39:04.655
It was Gage
who saw it first.

39:06.357 --> 39:10.527
He tried repeatedly
to scare it away,

39:10.561 --> 39:12.663
but every time
he drove it off,

39:12.696 --> 39:15.766
it kept coming back.

39:17.568 --> 39:19.170
Finally,

39:19.203 --> 39:22.506
my sister Amanda
noticed the animal.

39:22.539 --> 39:24.508
She's the one

39:24.541 --> 39:26.110
who took it in.

39:26.143 --> 39:29.680
Oh, the poor
little thing.

39:29.713 --> 39:31.682
It's starving.

39:31.715 --> 39:33.184
Is oo hungry,
darling?

39:34.718 --> 39:36.187
Is oo hungry?

39:37.721 --> 39:39.590
Cats aggravate
emphysema, Carolyn.

39:39.623 --> 39:42.093
Get rid of
the filthy thing.

39:42.126 --> 39:44.095
Cats aggravate
my brother, Carolyn.

39:44.128 --> 39:45.562
Don't pay
any attention.

39:45.596 --> 39:48.199
I want it
out of here!

39:48.232 --> 39:50.701
Either out of here
or dead!

39:50.734 --> 39:53.137
Which is it to be?

39:53.170 --> 39:54.538
Don't you ever

39:54.571 --> 39:56.540
dare to hurt
this cat!

39:58.109 --> 40:00.211
You hate cats.
You always have.

40:00.244 --> 40:02.713
You're wrong.
I don't hate cats.

40:02.746 --> 40:06.217
Cats hate me.
Don't you see?

40:06.250 --> 40:09.220
We're all in danger
while this animal's here!

40:09.253 --> 40:11.722
You'll find out!
You'll find out!

40:11.755 --> 40:12.623
You'll...

40:19.263 --> 40:20.631
You all right?

40:21.765 --> 40:23.134
I'll be fine.

40:25.269 --> 40:27.138
I'll be fine.

40:31.775 --> 40:34.745
You know who I am,
don't you?

40:34.778 --> 40:37.581
That is, where
my money comes from?

40:38.715 --> 40:40.651
Drogan pharmaceuticals.

40:40.684 --> 40:43.254
One of the biggest
drug companies

40:43.287 --> 40:45.256
in America, Mr. Halston.

40:45.289 --> 40:48.592
And the cornerstone
of our financial success

40:48.625 --> 40:50.727
has always been this.

40:51.828 --> 40:55.599
Tri-dormal-phenobarbin

40:55.632 --> 40:58.235
compound "g."

40:59.636 --> 41:02.173
Good old tri-dormal-g.

41:02.206 --> 41:06.143
A combination painkiller,
tranquilizer,

41:06.177 --> 41:08.779
and mild hallucinogen.

41:08.812 --> 41:11.282
Remarkably helpful
to those of us fighting

41:11.315 --> 41:14.718
the debilitating effects
of an aging heart.

41:14.751 --> 41:18.322
It's also
remarkably expensive.

41:18.355 --> 41:20.824
It's also remarkably
habit-forming.

41:22.493 --> 41:25.396
I've read
all about it, drogan.

41:25.429 --> 41:29.200
That stuff is one step
up from street junk.

41:29.233 --> 41:32.303
You've obviously
done very well with it.

41:32.336 --> 41:34.505
And you've
done well yourself.

41:34.538 --> 41:38.875
Saul loggia knows of
at least two dozen jobs

41:38.909 --> 41:44.415
you have done for
various members of the
professional community.

41:44.448 --> 41:46.350
All right.

41:46.383 --> 41:49.253
We each know who it is
we're dealing with.

41:52.356 --> 41:54.625
Tell me the rest
of the story

41:54.658 --> 41:55.826
about that cat.

41:55.859 --> 41:57.828
Ah, yes.

41:57.861 --> 41:59.663
The cat
killed them.

41:59.696 --> 42:02.233
I warned them,
but they wouldn't listen.

42:02.266 --> 42:03.934
They found out.

42:03.967 --> 42:06.470
They found out.

42:06.503 --> 42:09.806
My sister
was the first to die.

42:09.840 --> 42:12.443
It was midnight.

42:12.476 --> 42:15.246
She was on her way
to the kitchen

42:15.279 --> 42:18.449
to get that evil beast
some food.

42:18.482 --> 42:20.351
We heard her scream.

42:22.453 --> 42:23.587
Aah!

42:28.792 --> 42:30.594
Aah!

42:34.331 --> 42:35.366
Amanda?

42:36.500 --> 42:37.468
Amanda?

42:37.501 --> 42:39.670
What happened, Amanda?

42:41.672 --> 42:45.976
Death by accident,
the coroner said.

42:46.009 --> 42:47.744
But I knew.

42:54.518 --> 42:57.488
Why didn't you get rid
of the cat then?

42:57.521 --> 42:59.490
I tried,
Mr. Halston.

42:59.523 --> 43:01.392
I tried.

43:02.526 --> 43:03.694
I'll kill it!

43:04.828 --> 43:06.497
Let me have it!

43:06.530 --> 43:07.931
I'll kill it!

43:07.964 --> 43:10.000
Carolyn locked
the damn thing

43:10.033 --> 43:11.802
in her room.

43:11.835 --> 43:13.570
She became obsessed
with the animal.

43:13.604 --> 43:16.740
I'm going to kill it!
Do you hear me?

43:16.773 --> 43:19.576
I'll kill it!
I'll kill, kill, kill!

43:20.644 --> 43:22.279
My mother told me

43:22.313 --> 43:25.649
that cats like to get babies
and old people

43:25.682 --> 43:29.786
when they're asleep
and steal their breath.

44:03.420 --> 44:05.889
Carolyn died
at midnight as well.

44:05.922 --> 44:07.558
Suffocated in her bed.

44:07.591 --> 44:10.861
The coroner said
natural causes in her case,

44:10.894 --> 44:11.928
but again...

44:11.962 --> 44:14.331
I knew.

44:15.999 --> 44:18.435
What did you do then?

44:19.936 --> 44:23.907
I told Gage to get rid
of the vile thing.

44:23.940 --> 44:25.876
It took him
almost 24 hours

44:25.909 --> 44:28.745
to find the cat
and capture it.

44:28.779 --> 44:30.481
Without concern
for the time,

44:30.514 --> 44:33.817
I sent him out to milford
to the veterinarian...

44:35.919 --> 44:39.890
To have the beast put
away once and for all.

44:39.923 --> 44:41.992
I phoned ahead
to the vet.

44:42.025 --> 44:43.894
"Mr. Drogan," he said,

44:43.927 --> 44:45.496
"it's midnight."

45:43.520 --> 45:45.656
A week later,

45:45.689 --> 45:49.493
the day dick Gage
was buried,

45:49.526 --> 45:52.028
the cat came back.

45:52.062 --> 45:56.132
No one
actually witnessed
any of these deaths.

45:56.166 --> 45:57.734
What makes you think

45:57.768 --> 45:59.836
this cat
had anything
to do with it?

45:59.870 --> 46:01.838
I'm sure
it killed them.

46:01.872 --> 46:03.139
It killed
them all.

46:03.173 --> 46:05.008
And I'm next!

46:07.043 --> 46:08.912
I'm afraid of it,
halston.

46:08.945 --> 46:11.081
It skulks around
in the shadows,

46:11.114 --> 46:12.082
watching me.

46:12.115 --> 46:13.517
It's waiting.

46:13.550 --> 46:15.986
It's torturing me
by waiting.

46:16.019 --> 46:18.955
It's been sent
to punish me.

46:20.190 --> 46:21.725
I don't get it.

46:23.727 --> 46:26.530
Tri-dormal-g.

46:26.563 --> 46:28.231
That's what
it's about.

46:28.264 --> 46:29.933
It's a synthetic,

46:29.966 --> 46:33.637
developed in
our laboratories
in New Jersey.

46:33.670 --> 46:35.972
Our testing
of tri-dormal-g

46:36.006 --> 46:38.475
was confined almost
solely to cats

46:38.509 --> 46:40.110
because of
the unique quality

46:40.143 --> 46:42.546
of the feline
nervous system.

46:42.579 --> 46:44.748
How many
did you eliminate?

46:44.781 --> 46:47.551
Over four years
of testing...

46:47.584 --> 46:48.852
5,000 cats.

46:54.224 --> 46:56.893
5,000 of your buddies
get wasted,

46:56.927 --> 47:00.196
and they send you> back
to settle the score

47:00.230 --> 47:01.932
with drogan here,

47:01.965 --> 47:03.800
is that the deal,
pussycat?

47:03.834 --> 47:07.037
Don't make light
of it, halston.

47:07.070 --> 47:08.905
I warn you.

47:11.908 --> 47:16.747
I never make light
of any matter
involving $100,000.

47:16.780 --> 47:19.182
Then you'll
take the job?

47:19.215 --> 47:23.086
I could do it now
if you want me to.

47:23.119 --> 47:26.089
I could put my hands
around its neck

47:26.122 --> 47:27.524
and snap it.

47:31.762 --> 47:32.929
Son of a bitch!

47:34.631 --> 47:37.801
It's not going to be
that easy, Mr. Halston.

47:38.802 --> 47:40.070
Don't worry, drogan.

47:40.103 --> 47:42.606
I'll kill your cat
for you.

47:42.639 --> 47:45.976
Good. Kill it, bury it,
and bring me its tail

47:46.009 --> 47:50.947
so I can throw it
in the fire
and watch it burn.

47:50.981 --> 47:52.215
I'm going into the city.

47:52.248 --> 47:55.786
That's why I made
the taxi wait.

47:55.819 --> 47:58.088
There's food,
there's liquor,
there's everything.

47:58.121 --> 47:59.856
Everything
you could want.

48:02.158 --> 48:04.027
Everything
you could ever want.

48:35.659 --> 48:36.793
Okay, cat.

48:38.028 --> 48:40.363
It's just
you and me now.

48:40.396 --> 48:42.966
Jesus Christ.

48:42.999 --> 48:44.735
Crazy old fucker.

48:46.169 --> 48:47.904
Crazy old rich> fucker.

48:50.340 --> 48:52.308
How about it,
kitty cat?

49:28.712 --> 49:31.915
"Everything
you could ever want."

49:31.948 --> 49:35.752
Why is it rich guys always
buy the cheap stuff?

49:35.786 --> 49:37.620
Look at this shit.

49:38.922 --> 49:39.956
Hey, cat!

49:41.758 --> 49:44.627
For me, it's nothing
but the best.

49:45.195 --> 49:47.097
All the time.

49:52.035 --> 49:53.770
"Everything
you could ever want."

49:53.804 --> 49:55.138
Shit.

50:08.719 --> 50:10.386
Hey, you little
motherfucker!

50:10.420 --> 50:12.122
Nobody hits me twice!

50:12.155 --> 50:14.657
No fucking body
hits me twice!

50:22.733 --> 50:23.934
Can't get hot.

50:25.268 --> 50:28.939
Can't let yourself
get hot, ever.

50:28.972 --> 50:31.141
You make mistakes
when you're hot.

50:40.984 --> 50:42.085
What is this?

50:44.921 --> 50:46.089
What is this shit?

50:51.494 --> 50:52.763
Oh, no!

50:53.897 --> 50:54.865
No!

50:59.035 --> 51:01.304
This is a $100 shirt.

51:06.376 --> 51:08.144
You'll be sorry
you messed with me,

51:08.178 --> 51:09.312
you little shit.

51:11.147 --> 51:13.283
I got a reason
to kill you now.

52:18.548 --> 52:21.117
Drogan,
you cheap bastard.

52:32.528 --> 52:37.233
Come on, kitty cat.
Let's be friends again.

52:37.267 --> 52:40.470
We can go over
by the fire like before.

52:40.503 --> 52:42.605
You can sit
on my lap again,

52:42.638 --> 52:44.274
and I'll give you
a nice boost.

52:51.247 --> 52:53.884
This is the real stuff,
kitty cat.

52:53.917 --> 52:58.021
Not like that cheap crap
drogan sells.

52:58.054 --> 52:59.222
What do you say?

53:10.666 --> 53:12.568
You're beating me, pal.

53:13.603 --> 53:15.505
You're beating me good.

53:17.007 --> 53:19.075
I'm trying too hard.

53:24.080 --> 53:26.382
Hey, cat...

53:26.416 --> 53:28.885
I've never
blown a hit yet.

53:28.919 --> 53:30.921
It's just a matter of time.

53:30.954 --> 53:32.055
Aah!

53:32.088 --> 53:33.256
Aah!

53:33.289 --> 53:34.224
Get away!

53:34.257 --> 53:35.926
Get off of me!

53:35.959 --> 53:37.894
Aah!

53:37.928 --> 53:41.231
Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah!

53:41.264 --> 53:43.599
Aah! Aah!

53:57.513 --> 54:00.483
You're done for,
you fuck.

54:00.516 --> 54:03.253
The rest
of your nine lives

54:03.286 --> 54:06.656
are going in one lump sum.

54:17.500 --> 54:20.903
I can outwait you,
you little shit.

54:38.354 --> 54:41.357
I've never blown
a hit yet, kitty cat.

54:42.725 --> 54:45.095
This is the end of you.

54:48.198 --> 54:50.366
That's impossible.

54:50.400 --> 54:52.235
Fucking impossible!

54:52.268 --> 54:54.504
I had a dead bead
on you.

54:59.209 --> 55:00.977
Where are you?

55:05.115 --> 55:08.218
You son of a bitch,
I know you're in here.

55:13.789 --> 55:15.391
Aah!

55:18.028 --> 55:19.295
Aah!

55:43.486 --> 55:44.554
Aah...

55:45.788 --> 55:48.391
Aah! Aah!

55:48.424 --> 55:51.161
Aah! Oh! Aah!

55:51.194 --> 55:54.030
Aah! Aah!

56:50.886 --> 56:52.488
Oh, no.

56:54.390 --> 56:55.791
No.

57:17.680 --> 57:18.881
Aah.

57:28.758 --> 57:32.762
Aah. Aah. Aah! Aah!

57:34.464 --> 57:35.765
Aah! Aah!

58:02.858 --> 58:05.795
My goodness,
that was a scary story.

58:05.828 --> 58:08.464
But my favorites
were the love stories.

58:08.498 --> 58:12.235
Uh, yeah. There's
one story in that book
that's really scary.

58:12.268 --> 58:14.537
But it's
a love story, too.

58:14.570 --> 58:15.571
Really?

58:15.605 --> 58:16.872
Yeah.

58:16.906 --> 58:18.541
Which one was that?

58:18.574 --> 58:20.676
The one
that's in New York.

58:20.710 --> 58:23.646
You still have to cook
for quite a while,

58:23.679 --> 58:26.282
but I'd love
to hear the story.

58:26.316 --> 58:29.919
"There's a part of New York
that's busy during the day,

58:29.952 --> 58:32.822
"but late at night when
hardly anyone is around,

58:32.855 --> 58:34.424
"strange things
sometimes happen.

58:34.457 --> 58:38.394
"10 years ago,
on a cold, dreary night,

58:38.428 --> 58:39.829
"an artist named Preston

58:39.862 --> 58:42.398
saw something
very, very strange."

59:30.045 --> 59:32.248
Oh, yes. Wyatt.

59:38.321 --> 59:39.489
Hello.

59:39.522 --> 59:41.391
Preston, it's jer.

59:41.424 --> 59:42.758
There's a guy here--

59:42.792 --> 59:45.828
fortyish, anal retentive
type, right?

59:45.861 --> 59:47.497
On the money.

59:47.530 --> 59:49.732
Tell him
I've been waiting
half an hour.

59:51.033 --> 59:53.436
He's been waiting
half an hour.

01:00:05.915 --> 01:00:08.684
Another drambuie
on the rocks, please.

01:00:13.589 --> 01:00:15.325
This one's on him.

01:00:20.663 --> 01:00:21.997
4.50.

01:00:22.031 --> 01:00:23.733
Keep it.

01:00:23.766 --> 01:00:25.000
Wyatt, I'm sorry.

01:00:25.034 --> 01:00:27.603
I was just working
on a new piece.

01:00:27.637 --> 01:00:28.838
Ah, come here.

01:00:28.871 --> 01:00:30.840
Hey, jer.
Give me a holsten.

01:00:32.508 --> 01:00:34.944
So, did you
bring me a check

01:00:34.977 --> 01:00:37.380
or just a lot of cash?

01:00:37.413 --> 01:00:39.315
Thanks, jer.

01:00:39.349 --> 01:00:43.018
Judith says she hasn't
moved anything of yours
in four months.

01:00:43.052 --> 01:00:47.723
Judith amato.
Big gallery
on west Broadway.

01:00:47.757 --> 01:00:51.494
If it isn't
out by tomorrow,
it gets junked.

01:00:51.527 --> 01:00:55.631
What? Wyatt, you've
got to convince her
that i--

01:00:55.665 --> 01:00:58.368
I can't convince her
of anything.

01:00:58.401 --> 01:01:01.103
Wyatt, you're my agent.

01:01:01.136 --> 01:01:05.107
Well, not exactly.

01:01:05.140 --> 01:01:11.881
Preston, your artistic
vision is just not
a marketable commodity.

01:01:11.914 --> 01:01:15.351
Wyatt, I'm broke.
I can't live on nothing.

01:01:15.385 --> 01:01:18.020
And I can't live
on 10% of nothing.

01:01:19.789 --> 01:01:21.757
You're a monster.

01:01:23.393 --> 01:01:24.894
I'm an agent.

01:01:26.729 --> 01:01:30.099
For an agent,
being a monster
is just credentials.

01:01:33.135 --> 01:01:34.970
I'm sorry, Preston.

01:01:48.818 --> 01:01:50.052
Fuck you!

01:01:53.856 --> 01:01:56.726
Jesus, what am I
supposed to do now?

01:02:02.965 --> 01:02:05.034
Ah, Jesus.

01:02:13.142 --> 01:02:18.113
There's Van gogh.
Degas. Rodin.

01:02:19.181 --> 01:02:20.950
They didn't have agents.

01:02:20.983 --> 01:02:24.520
How'd they
get so successful?

01:02:24.554 --> 01:02:26.689
They died.

01:02:28.924 --> 01:02:31.861
Time to put it to bed,
Preston.

01:02:31.894 --> 01:02:33.429
All right.

01:02:34.697 --> 01:02:35.965
What about Maddox?

01:02:37.467 --> 01:02:40.503
Let him out
in the morning.

01:02:40.536 --> 01:02:43.005
That's probably
how I'll end up.

01:02:44.206 --> 01:02:45.641
Oh, jeez.

01:02:45.675 --> 01:02:47.877
You're pissed
out of your mind.

01:02:47.910 --> 01:02:48.878
Ooh.

01:02:48.911 --> 01:02:50.079
I'll take you home.

01:02:50.112 --> 01:02:51.113
All right.

01:03:28.651 --> 01:03:30.720
Why didn't you
do that inside?

01:03:30.753 --> 01:03:33.623
I did. It just goes
right through.

01:04:07.757 --> 01:04:09.859
Oh, my god!

01:04:12.995 --> 01:04:14.163
Aah!

01:04:14.196 --> 01:04:15.665
Jer.

01:04:16.999 --> 01:04:18.901
Help me.

01:04:18.934 --> 01:04:20.636
Help me!

01:04:28.678 --> 01:04:29.945
Jesus.

01:04:31.113 --> 01:04:34.149
Maddox!
Maddox, open the door!

01:04:34.183 --> 01:04:37.720
Help! Maddox,
open the door!

01:04:37.753 --> 01:04:39.789
Please! Aah!

01:04:41.190 --> 01:04:43.225
Please! Please don't!

01:04:43.258 --> 01:04:47.963
Your life in exchange
for a promise.

01:04:47.997 --> 01:04:49.098
You got it.

01:04:49.131 --> 01:04:51.133
If I let you go,

01:04:51.166 --> 01:04:54.303
you must swear you'll
never say you saw me.

01:04:54.336 --> 01:04:56.606
Never say
you heard me speak.

01:04:56.639 --> 01:04:58.708
Never tell anyone
how I look.

01:04:58.741 --> 01:05:01.577
Never repeat
what I've said.

01:05:01.611 --> 01:05:03.879
A promise forever.

01:05:03.913 --> 01:05:05.748
You got to be kidding.

01:05:07.082 --> 01:05:08.618
I--i--promise!

01:05:08.651 --> 01:05:11.053
Cross your heart?

01:05:11.086 --> 01:05:11.987
Ugh.

01:05:13.155 --> 01:05:15.090
I promise!

01:05:50.325 --> 01:05:51.293
Aah.

01:05:51.326 --> 01:05:52.294
Come here.

01:05:52.327 --> 01:05:53.829
No! Oh, god!

01:05:53.863 --> 01:05:56.999
Shh! Shut up.
Please be quiet.

01:05:57.032 --> 01:05:59.168
Please be quiet.
Shh.

01:05:59.201 --> 01:06:01.270
I'm not going
to hurt you.

01:06:01.303 --> 01:06:03.072
Just be quiet,
all right?

01:06:03.105 --> 01:06:06.175
All right?
I won't hurt you.

01:06:06.208 --> 01:06:08.143
Let go of me!

01:06:08.177 --> 01:06:10.245
What are you
trying to do?

01:06:10.279 --> 01:06:12.414
Take a taxi.

01:06:12.447 --> 01:06:15.785
You don't see
any taxis out here,
do you?

01:06:15.818 --> 01:06:17.086
If you want one,

01:06:17.119 --> 01:06:19.989
you can use the phone
from my place.

01:06:23.292 --> 01:06:24.994
Look, my name
is Preston.

01:06:25.027 --> 01:06:27.897
I live just
around the corner.

01:06:30.299 --> 01:06:31.300
Come on.

01:06:35.838 --> 01:06:37.106
Come on.

01:06:47.783 --> 01:06:50.753
I thought someone
was following me
back there.

01:06:50.786 --> 01:06:51.754
That wasn't me.

01:06:53.088 --> 01:06:54.189
Here we are.

01:06:56.391 --> 01:06:58.460
What are you
doing down here?

01:06:58.493 --> 01:07:02.798
I was supposed to
meet some friends,
but I got lost.

01:07:02.832 --> 01:07:03.999
Here you go.

01:07:16.511 --> 01:07:19.148
So what were you doing
out this late?

01:07:19.181 --> 01:07:22.417
I was having an argument.

01:07:22.451 --> 01:07:24.787
My agent dumped me
tonight.

01:07:42.404 --> 01:07:45.374
Police, 16th precinct.
Hello?

01:07:45.407 --> 01:07:46.408
Uh...

01:07:48.543 --> 01:07:49.812
Anyone there?

01:07:52.047 --> 01:07:53.783
Jerk.

01:07:53.816 --> 01:07:54.950
The line's busy.

01:07:54.984 --> 01:07:57.887
We'll try again
in a minute.

01:07:59.421 --> 01:08:02.858
By the way...
What's your name?

01:08:02.892 --> 01:08:04.960
Carola.

01:08:06.261 --> 01:08:07.396
Carola.

01:08:09.231 --> 01:08:11.266
Can I have something
to drink?

01:08:12.401 --> 01:08:13.435
Sure.

01:08:22.144 --> 01:08:24.779
So where are you
from, anyway?

01:08:24.814 --> 01:08:26.148
Colorado.

01:08:26.180 --> 01:08:27.349
Sort of.

01:08:27.381 --> 01:08:30.484
I had a boyfriend
in California.

01:08:30.519 --> 01:08:33.988
But...
It didn't work out,

01:08:34.023 --> 01:08:36.125
so I left.

01:08:39.428 --> 01:08:42.331
You're the first
real artist
I've ever met.

01:08:42.363 --> 01:08:44.265
Tell that to my agent.

01:08:48.904 --> 01:08:50.772
Did he do that?

01:08:56.511 --> 01:08:59.481
I had a run-in
with a bottle of scotch.

01:09:10.158 --> 01:09:11.593
I'm sorry.

01:09:11.626 --> 01:09:13.194
It's all right.

01:09:15.564 --> 01:09:17.867
I'm sorry.

01:09:19.301 --> 01:09:22.270
Say, did you try
that taxi again?

01:09:26.541 --> 01:09:28.176
Maybe you should
wait till morning.

01:10:36.278 --> 01:10:38.213
Good morning.

01:10:50.025 --> 01:10:53.395
Last night was
very important to me.

01:10:57.566 --> 01:11:00.035
It was a nightmare.

01:11:04.106 --> 01:11:05.941
Oh, no, carola!

01:11:05.975 --> 01:11:07.376
Not you!

01:11:07.409 --> 01:11:10.012
It was everything else
until I ran into you.

01:11:10.045 --> 01:11:12.081
That part was good.

01:11:12.114 --> 01:11:13.949
It was very good.

01:11:15.184 --> 01:11:16.986
I needed it.

01:11:17.019 --> 01:11:19.588
I need more of it.

01:11:19.621 --> 01:11:22.992
I do, too.
Right now.

01:11:26.128 --> 01:11:27.997
Oh, yes.

01:11:34.003 --> 01:11:36.405
Help me!

01:11:41.376 --> 01:11:43.245
Oh, look...

01:11:43.278 --> 01:11:46.148
I have to go out
for a while.

01:11:58.093 --> 01:11:59.494
Wait for me.

01:12:21.650 --> 01:12:23.718
Hey, that's
my friend!

01:12:23.752 --> 01:12:26.121
That's my friend!

01:12:26.155 --> 01:12:28.190
I want to go!

01:12:30.159 --> 01:12:33.228
Someone cut off
his head!

01:12:36.165 --> 01:12:37.199
Carola?

01:12:45.840 --> 01:12:47.042
Carola?

01:13:08.263 --> 01:13:11.133
Yeah. I would've
left, too.

01:13:17.106 --> 01:13:18.540
Help me!

01:13:49.738 --> 01:13:51.240
Yeah.

01:13:51.273 --> 01:13:52.207
It's carola.

01:13:52.241 --> 01:13:54.109
Can I come up?

01:13:55.244 --> 01:13:56.111
Sure.

01:14:06.488 --> 01:14:07.356
Jesus.

01:14:19.334 --> 01:14:21.570
I know what
you're thinking,

01:14:21.603 --> 01:14:24.439
but the girl
I'm staying with,
her boyfriend--

01:14:24.473 --> 01:14:26.375
I didn't ask
any questions.

01:14:45.294 --> 01:14:48.263
I called
a friend of mine--

01:14:48.297 --> 01:14:50.432
she's a friend
of a friend.

01:14:50.465 --> 01:14:52.734
She owns a gallery
on Houston street.

01:14:52.767 --> 01:14:54.736
That's
house-ton street.

01:14:54.769 --> 01:14:59.274
I told her how wonderful
I thought your work was,

01:14:59.308 --> 01:15:02.344
so she'd like
to come see it.

01:15:02.377 --> 01:15:04.513
Does she
have a name?

01:15:04.546 --> 01:15:07.349
Victorine...

01:15:07.382 --> 01:15:09.851
But I don't remember
the rest.

01:15:09.884 --> 01:15:11.853
Roget?

01:15:11.886 --> 01:15:14.256
Victorine roget?

01:15:15.890 --> 01:15:17.759
A friend
of a friend?

01:15:19.394 --> 01:15:21.330
Jesus.

01:15:21.363 --> 01:15:23.465
I hope you don't mind.

01:15:23.498 --> 01:15:27.236
Victorine roget...

01:15:27.269 --> 01:15:29.938
Owns the hottest
gallery downtown.

01:15:31.573 --> 01:15:33.975
Of course
I don't mind!

01:15:34.008 --> 01:15:36.177
It's what
I've always wanted.

01:15:50.325 --> 01:15:52.594
So how does it feel
to be a huge success?

01:15:52.627 --> 01:15:57.666
Victorine just sold
a piece to a couple
for $23,000.

01:15:57.699 --> 01:15:59.401
You're a smash.

01:16:04.606 --> 01:16:06.475
Well?

01:16:07.642 --> 01:16:09.344
Damn.

01:16:10.345 --> 01:16:11.246
What?

01:16:13.615 --> 01:16:15.650
Preston.

01:16:17.452 --> 01:16:18.653
Excuse me.

01:16:20.822 --> 01:16:22.357
Hey, Maddox.

01:16:22.391 --> 01:16:23.425
Nice work.

01:16:23.458 --> 01:16:24.659
Thanks.

01:16:24.693 --> 01:16:27.429
I haven't seen you
around, pal.

01:16:28.830 --> 01:16:31.366
Not since
the night jer died.

01:16:31.400 --> 01:16:33.268
I'm carola.

01:16:33.302 --> 01:16:35.804
Nice
to meet you.

01:16:35.837 --> 01:16:36.938
Who's jer?

01:16:36.971 --> 01:16:39.308
The bartender
at this bar--

01:16:39.341 --> 01:16:41.343
he died.

01:16:41.376 --> 01:16:43.978
In the alley
out back.

01:16:44.012 --> 01:16:45.980
Come on. Let's go.

01:16:46.014 --> 01:16:48.617
Hey, you know
something, don't you?

01:16:48.650 --> 01:16:49.951
Just sober up, Maddox,

01:16:49.984 --> 01:16:52.587
before someone puts
a match to your breath.

01:16:52.621 --> 01:16:53.788
Preston.

01:16:53.822 --> 01:16:56.791
I told the cops
everything I knew,

01:16:56.825 --> 01:16:58.493
which is
exactly nothing.

01:16:58.527 --> 01:16:59.861
Come on.

01:17:18.079 --> 01:17:20.949
Promise forever.

01:17:25.787 --> 01:17:29.057
So are you sorry
you met me?

01:17:29.090 --> 01:17:31.059
You take care of me.

01:17:31.092 --> 01:17:32.894
Maybe just
a little bit...

01:17:34.028 --> 01:17:35.997
I take care of you.

01:17:36.030 --> 01:17:40.602
Will you take care
of me...And my child?

01:17:42.737 --> 01:17:44.773
Your child?

01:17:47.041 --> 01:17:49.511
Oh, so...

01:17:51.746 --> 01:17:55.384
We going to make
this little bastard
legitimate?

01:17:55.417 --> 01:17:57.386
To put it
another way...

01:17:59.053 --> 01:18:00.889
Will you marry me?

01:18:12.133 --> 01:18:14.703
Will you marry me
like this?

01:18:16.838 --> 01:18:18.807
Oh, ho ho!
Yes, baby!

01:18:18.840 --> 01:18:19.774
No! I'm pregnant!

01:18:19.808 --> 01:18:21.743
Come here,
sweetie!

01:18:21.776 --> 01:18:23.011
No, no, please!

01:19:15.196 --> 01:19:17.899
Where are
the scissors...Scissors?

01:19:25.574 --> 01:19:26.908
Oh! Ohh.

01:19:36.150 --> 01:19:39.120
Mom, look what Wyatt
bought for me!

01:19:39.153 --> 01:19:42.957
They took our picture
a million times.

01:19:42.991 --> 01:19:44.926
These kids
ran me ragged.

01:19:44.959 --> 01:19:47.862
Each has the metabolism
of a hummingbird.

01:19:47.896 --> 01:19:53.001
Ooh, is there some party
tonight that I'm missing?

01:19:53.034 --> 01:19:55.670
Yes. Preston and I
are celebrating

01:19:55.704 --> 01:19:58.973
the 10th anniversary of
the night we first met.

01:19:59.007 --> 01:20:01.976
When you thought he was
going to rape you?

01:20:02.010 --> 01:20:04.679
Yes, darling.
It's also the night

01:20:04.713 --> 01:20:07.616
that Wyatt here gave
your father the shaft.

01:20:07.649 --> 01:20:09.250
I had to murder
three other agents

01:20:09.283 --> 01:20:11.753
before you'd let me
represent him again.

01:20:11.786 --> 01:20:13.722
And you're still
on probation,

01:20:13.755 --> 01:20:15.156
you mercenary wretch.

01:20:15.189 --> 01:20:17.158
Find another agent
that'll baby-sit

01:20:17.191 --> 01:20:20.161
the spawn of hell
on a Saturday night.

01:20:20.194 --> 01:20:21.195
Wyatt!

01:20:21.229 --> 01:20:22.964
Aah!

01:20:25.900 --> 01:20:27.769
Choose your weapon.

01:20:54.162 --> 01:20:55.496
10 years.

01:20:57.165 --> 01:20:59.133
So many things
have changed.

01:20:59.167 --> 01:21:01.202
Changed for
the better, I hope.

01:21:03.237 --> 01:21:06.741
The night I met you,
I almost died.

01:21:06.775 --> 01:21:07.942
What do you mean?

01:21:09.744 --> 01:21:11.212
Well, let's just say

01:21:11.245 --> 01:21:14.215
it was the night
my life started
over again.

01:21:45.313 --> 01:21:46.948
So, happy anniversary.

01:21:51.920 --> 01:21:53.822
You know,
you saved Preston

01:21:53.855 --> 01:21:55.556
from people like me.

01:21:56.925 --> 01:21:58.893
She saved me
from myself.

01:21:58.927 --> 01:22:00.128
Time to go.

01:22:00.161 --> 01:22:03.064
Sincerity is bad
for my self-image.

01:22:04.999 --> 01:22:06.267
Good night, Wyatt.

01:22:06.300 --> 01:22:07.869
Good night,
Wyatt.

01:22:13.007 --> 01:22:14.976
Whoa, taxi!

01:22:15.009 --> 01:22:16.344
Taxi!

01:22:22.316 --> 01:22:24.285
Let's move
to the country.

01:22:24.318 --> 01:22:26.287
We'll buy
a big house

01:22:26.320 --> 01:22:28.857
with lots of land
for the kids.

01:22:28.890 --> 01:22:30.391
They'd hate it
as much as you would.

01:22:30.424 --> 01:22:33.027
Then for you.

01:22:33.061 --> 01:22:34.663
There's nothing
you could give me

01:22:34.696 --> 01:22:37.198
that I don't
already have.

01:22:40.334 --> 01:22:42.270
Yes, there is.

01:22:42.303 --> 01:22:45.173
Oh, Christ,
I hate this neighborhood.

01:22:45.206 --> 01:22:47.375
Can't get
a cab here ever.

01:23:02.957 --> 01:23:05.794
No one has
ever seen this.

01:23:30.985 --> 01:23:32.787
That's what killed jer.

01:23:34.388 --> 01:23:36.357
Then it turned on me.

01:23:36.390 --> 01:23:38.727
I knew
I was going to die,

01:23:38.760 --> 01:23:41.229
but it spoke. It spoke.

01:23:41.262 --> 01:23:43.698
It told me
it wouldn't kill me

01:23:43.732 --> 01:23:47.736
if I promised
never to tell anybody
what I'd seen.

01:23:47.769 --> 01:23:49.403
So I never told anybody.

01:23:51.305 --> 01:23:53.374
Then why are you
telling me?

01:23:53.407 --> 01:23:55.777
Because you're the most
important thing

01:23:55.810 --> 01:23:57.278
in my life.

01:23:57.311 --> 01:23:59.781
You've brought me
10 years of happiness,

01:23:59.814 --> 01:24:01.282
10 years of success,

01:24:01.315 --> 01:24:03.451
10 years
of a perfect life.

01:24:03.484 --> 01:24:06.020
I'm telling you
because I love you.

01:24:08.022 --> 01:24:10.725
You deserve everything
I can give you,

01:24:10.759 --> 01:24:14.028
and I've never
given you the truth

01:24:14.062 --> 01:24:17.165
about what happened
the night we met.

01:24:47.461 --> 01:24:48.429
What's wrong?

01:24:48.462 --> 01:24:50.431
I'm not
making this up.

01:24:50.464 --> 01:24:52.000
I'm telling you
the truth.

01:24:55.169 --> 01:24:58.807
You promised
you'd never tell!

01:25:00.975 --> 01:25:02.043
Ohh!

01:25:03.411 --> 01:25:06.114
Aah!

01:25:20.962 --> 01:25:22.263
Oh, god.

01:25:22.296 --> 01:25:25.266
You broke your promise,
you idiot!

01:25:25.299 --> 01:25:27.068
I loved you!

01:25:27.101 --> 01:25:28.302
Ugh!

01:25:31.272 --> 01:25:32.540
Jesus, please...

01:25:36.310 --> 01:25:39.280
Carola, stop it!
Just change back.

01:25:39.313 --> 01:25:40.915
I can't.

01:25:56.064 --> 01:25:57.899
No.

01:25:57.932 --> 01:25:59.100
No!

01:25:59.133 --> 01:26:01.903
Aah!

01:26:01.936 --> 01:26:04.538
What's wrong
with the kids?
Stop it!

01:26:04.572 --> 01:26:06.440
It's too late.

01:26:06.474 --> 01:26:09.844
You betrayed
your vow.

01:26:12.580 --> 01:26:14.849
It can't be!

01:26:17.118 --> 01:26:19.420
No!

01:26:23.091 --> 01:26:25.426
I'm so sorry.

01:26:36.070 --> 01:26:38.239
Carola...

01:26:38.272 --> 01:26:40.174
I loved you.

01:26:40.208 --> 01:26:42.110
And I loved you, too,

01:26:42.143 --> 01:26:43.644
but you broke
your vow,

01:26:43.677 --> 01:26:46.447
and that sealed
our destiny.

01:27:12.673 --> 01:27:14.242
Yo!

01:27:21.015 --> 01:27:25.253
Raarrr!

01:27:29.390 --> 01:27:31.125
What the hell
was that?

01:27:31.159 --> 01:27:33.194
I don't want to know.

01:28:06.427 --> 01:28:10.631
My goodness,
you really did keep
the best one for last.

01:28:10.664 --> 01:28:14.602
No. I saved the really,
really best one for now.

01:28:14.635 --> 01:28:16.104
You should have told me

01:28:16.137 --> 01:28:18.172
the really, really
best story before,

01:28:18.206 --> 01:28:20.274
'cause now
it's too late.

01:28:22.110 --> 01:28:25.579
It's the best one because
there's a happy ending,

01:28:25.613 --> 01:28:27.648
a really happy ending.

01:28:27.681 --> 01:28:30.584
The stories in that book
don't have happy endings.

01:28:30.618 --> 01:28:33.121
But you got to
hear this story.

01:28:33.154 --> 01:28:34.622
This kid,
his name's Timmy...

01:28:34.655 --> 01:28:36.757
That's nice, dear.

01:28:36.790 --> 01:28:39.393
And Timmy's older brother
had this paper route.

01:28:39.427 --> 01:28:42.163
One day, when
Timmy's brother got sick,

01:28:42.196 --> 01:28:43.631
Timmy had to go collecting.

01:28:43.664 --> 01:28:46.600
Timmy went
to this one house,

01:28:46.634 --> 01:28:49.303
and this lady at the door
said, "come in."

01:28:49.337 --> 01:28:53.141
He went inside, and she
threw him into a pantry.

01:28:53.174 --> 01:28:56.144
She made him eat cookies
to get fat

01:28:56.177 --> 01:28:59.647
'cause she was going to
kill him and eat him!

01:28:59.680 --> 01:29:01.149
This is your story,

01:29:01.182 --> 01:29:04.385
and we both know
how it comes out.

01:29:04.418 --> 01:29:07.221
But you don't. Something
really weird happens.

01:29:07.255 --> 01:29:08.789
Oh, really?

01:29:08.822 --> 01:29:12.126
Yeah. Uh, Timmy
had these marbles

01:29:12.160 --> 01:29:13.561
in his pocket,

01:29:13.594 --> 01:29:15.729
and they were
all shiny and slippery.

01:29:15.763 --> 01:29:17.598
When he threw them
on the floor...

01:29:17.631 --> 01:29:19.533
She didn't see
where they went...

01:29:19.567 --> 01:29:21.769
And she slipped!

01:29:26.474 --> 01:29:28.409
Timmy saw his chance
to escape...

01:29:30.344 --> 01:29:34.215
If he could just
reach the keys!

01:29:46.227 --> 01:29:49.730
Aah!

01:29:52.700 --> 01:29:57.338
Aah!

01:30:01.742 --> 01:30:04.178
Don't you just love
happy endings?
