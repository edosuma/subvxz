19:17.614 --> 19:19.184
Is that Paula's?

19:19.284 --> 19:20.554
Why do you have it?

19:20.654 --> 19:23.660
Trey, you're a wonderful guy.

19:23.760 --> 19:27.200
You are sweet and charming
and kind,

19:27.300 --> 19:30.239
and Paula doesn't deserve you.

19:30.339 --> 19:31.475
What're you talking about?

19:31.576 --> 19:33.513
I know you're never gonna
leave her.

19:33.613 --> 19:35.751
This way you don't have to.

19:35.851 --> 19:37.320
Oh my god, you took this
on purpose?

19:37.420 --> 19:39.825
When she finds that lunatic
she'll try and shoot him

19:39.925 --> 19:41.929
but click, no bullets.

19:42.030 --> 19:44.735
And then he'll do to her what he
did to those people back there.

19:44.835 --> 19:47.775
And then we can be together.

19:54.989 --> 19:56.893
We can't.

19:57.995 --> 19:59.732
Trey.

19:59.832 --> 20:01.803
Don't give her that clip.

20:01.903 --> 20:05.342
This will all work out perfectly
if you just do nothing.

20:06.411 --> 20:08.750
She's the mother of my child.

20:16.733 --> 20:19.705
Some of this tissue has already
becoming necrotic.

20:19.805 --> 20:22.578
I'm gonna have to remove the
margins before I can stitch it.

20:22.678 --> 20:25.817
Just uh, let me get something
to numb the area.

20:25.917 --> 20:26.686
No!

20:26.786 --> 20:28.957
Forget it.

20:29.057 --> 20:30.961
Lauren, it's just
a local anesthetic.

20:31.061 --> 20:32.798
No drugs.

20:32.898 --> 20:34.535
You of all people
should know that.

20:34.635 --> 20:35.670
Fine.

20:35.771 --> 20:37.273
But it's gonna hurt
like hell.

20:37.373 --> 20:39.344
[coughing]

20:42.483 --> 20:43.953
Mrs. French?

20:44.053 --> 20:46.526
What... what are you doing?

20:46.626 --> 20:49.264
Why... why are you on oxygen?

20:49.832 --> 20:51.569
I have lung cancer.

20:51.669 --> 20:54.307
Remember that death sentence
you dropped on me this morning?

20:54.407 --> 20:56.712
Yeah, but you weren't
on oxygen.

21:01.756 --> 21:04.995
So, is this business
or personal?

21:05.095 --> 21:06.465
Oh, no, it's definitely
business.

21:06.566 --> 21:08.503
Don't change the subject.

21:11.041 --> 21:15.884
I was having a little trouble
catching my breath.

21:15.984 --> 21:17.855
After I had a cigarette.

21:20.392 --> 21:22.330
You should not be smoking.

21:22.430 --> 21:24.802
I'm dying, kid.
What's it matter?

21:24.902 --> 21:29.344
If I gotta go, I'm gonna go
out enjoying myself, hmm?

21:30.780 --> 21:32.751
I like her.
You want one?

21:32.851 --> 21:35.724
Hey. No, no.
Absolutely not.

21:35.824 --> 21:37.460
Buzz kill.

21:39.497 --> 21:41.602
Nobody's answering
at the police station.

21:45.544 --> 21:46.344
She gonna be ok?

21:46.444 --> 21:48.750
Calm down.
I'll be fine.

21:48.850 --> 21:50.821
I was asking him.

21:51.421 --> 21:52.290
Cam: I don't know if that bite's
gonna turn you

21:53.292 --> 21:54.427
into one of those things
or not.

21:55.564 --> 21:56.666
Honestly, I have no idea
what the pathology of this is.

21:57.901 --> 21:58.603
You're the doctor, aren't you
supposed to know this shit?

21:59.672 --> 22:00.607
Oh, sorry they didn't teach
zombie epidemiology

22:00.707 --> 22:02.343
in med school.

22:46.164 --> 22:47.400
Gotcha!

22:49.404 --> 22:51.408
Come on out.

22:52.811 --> 22:54.682
I'm not gonna hurt ya.

22:55.717 --> 22:57.486
Son of a bitch.

23:05.537 --> 23:07.975
Paula, I need to talk to you.

23:08.075 --> 23:09.979
He's not even here.

23:10.079 --> 23:12.851
Paula, it's not what you think.

23:14.755 --> 23:15.957
Nicole, look out!

23:16.057 --> 23:16.993
[screams]

23:17.093 --> 23:18.462
[gun clicking]

23:18.563 --> 23:19.865
[screaming]

23:19.965 --> 23:20.834
What the hell?

23:20.934 --> 23:22.838
[screaming]

23:22.938 --> 23:24.575
No!

23:24.675 --> 23:28.683
[screaming]

23:32.524 --> 23:35.530
[choking]

23:36.197 --> 23:39.605
[screaming]

23:56.071 --> 23:57.741
[yells]

24:05.055 --> 24:07.828
[screaming]

24:12.738 --> 24:15.476
Please, don't.

24:15.844 --> 24:18.783
Just... don't.

24:21.622 --> 24:23.660
[tearfully]
I'm so sorry.

24:23.760 --> 24:25.864
You didn't deserve this.

24:37.286 --> 24:38.188
Is she...

24:38.288 --> 24:44.067
She just loved...
you so much.

24:44.167 --> 24:46.772
She's like family.

24:47.006 --> 24:48.943
I don't get it.

24:49.143 --> 24:51.214
What the hell happened
to my clip?

24:51.314 --> 24:53.619
Maybe it just fell out?

24:53.720 --> 24:55.857
Clips don't just fall out, Trey.

24:55.957 --> 24:56.959
I don't know, Paula.

24:57.761 --> 24:58.028
Does it really matter
right now?

24:58.128 --> 24:59.765
Yes!

25:00.867 --> 25:02.604
If my gun had been loaded
Nicole wouldn't be dead.

25:09.017 --> 25:10.954
You're just going to leave her?

25:11.722 --> 25:13.693
Yes, Trey.
Leave her.

25:19.303 --> 25:21.575
Fuck, he's gone.
Let's go.

25:29.758 --> 25:30.760
Goodbye.

25:49.363 --> 25:51.635
I can't... I can't
quite reach.

25:51.736 --> 25:53.171
Hurry up, man.
You're pulling my arm off.

25:53.271 --> 25:55.008
I'm almost there,
almost there.

25:55.109 --> 25:55.810
Dude, my hand's slipping.

25:55.910 --> 25:56.746
Almost there.

25:57.313 --> 25:58.549
My hand's slipping, oh!

25:58.649 --> 26:01.622
Shit!

26:01.722 --> 26:02.991
My kicks.

26:05.964 --> 26:07.032
Man.

26:07.133 --> 26:07.901
[laughing]

26:08.001 --> 26:09.270
Look, it's not funny.

26:09.370 --> 26:11.609
Man, you're right there.
Just grab the keg.

26:11.709 --> 26:12.944
Pull it out.

26:13.278 --> 26:14.280
Come on.

26:19.123 --> 26:20.760
Yeah, just pull it out.

26:24.000 --> 26:25.603
Yeah, ok, I gotcha.

26:26.371 --> 26:28.576
‐Pull, bro.
‐I'm pulling.

26:28.676 --> 26:29.578
There you go.

26:29.678 --> 26:33.986
[out of breath]

26:34.086 --> 26:36.124
Today sucks.

26:36.224 --> 26:38.863
Ok, our one senior skip day
and the funniest thing

26:38.963 --> 26:42.103
that we have done is chase Cam
around a cemetery.

26:42.203 --> 26:45.242
Yeah. Yeah, it was
pretty weak.

26:46.277 --> 26:47.881
Man, look.

26:47.981 --> 26:50.252
If you wanna kick Cam's ass,
I'll kick Cam's ass.

26:50.352 --> 26:51.354
'Cause I'm good like that.

26:52.356 --> 26:52.591
No, man, it's not that
I wanna kick his ass.

26:52.958 --> 26:54.060
I just...

26:55.028 --> 26:57.066
Alright, what's up?
You gotta talk to me.

27:01.675 --> 27:02.777
I don't know.

27:02.878 --> 27:05.015
Bro, I'm here for you.

27:11.896 --> 27:13.799
It's just Cam and I used
to be best friends‐

27:13.900 --> 27:15.068
Holy fuck.

27:17.406 --> 27:19.678
I‐ I think it's the party!

27:19.778 --> 27:22.183
Yo, it's the party!
It's the‐ it's the party!

27:22.283 --> 27:23.151
Dude.

27:48.468 --> 27:50.640
Everybody get down!

27:55.917 --> 27:58.956
That's right, eyes on me.
Not on them, asshole.

28:01.427 --> 28:03.198
Ok, ok. That's it.

28:03.298 --> 28:04.267
No more stitches.
You're done.

28:04.367 --> 28:06.204
Lauren, you could really use
a couple more‐

28:08.475 --> 28:10.145
I'd say you're done.

28:11.214 --> 28:12.216
[distant gunshot]

28:14.453 --> 28:16.391
Was that a gunshot?

28:17.293 --> 28:18.829
You don't think...

28:22.504 --> 28:24.908
[gunshots]

28:29.450 --> 28:31.989
I need you all to clear out!

28:32.089 --> 28:34.026
[screaming]

28:35.229 --> 28:36.999
Don't worry, I got this!

28:37.099 --> 28:39.972
[screaming]

28:40.072 --> 28:41.307
[gunshots]

28:43.779 --> 28:46.117
[gunshots]

28:53.498 --> 28:55.335
What kind of drugs
is this guy on?

28:55.435 --> 28:56.839
I don't think it's drugs.

28:57.039 --> 29:04.153
[gunshots]

29:04.253 --> 29:05.122
[gun clicks]

29:05.222 --> 29:07.126
Shit, I'm out!

29:07.493 --> 29:09.063
Then reload!

29:09.932 --> 29:10.733
The gun was for show, Trey!

29:10.833 --> 29:12.771
I wasn't planning
on shooting someone!

29:13.238 --> 29:14.206
[growling]

29:15.075 --> 29:16.077
Paula!

29:16.177 --> 29:17.948
Paula, help me!

29:20.954 --> 29:22.456
Get off of my husband!

29:23.425 --> 29:33.411
[groaning]

29:38.088 --> 29:40.225
He should be dead, right?

29:53.018 --> 29:54.955
Holy shit.

29:55.055 --> 29:56.457
He's not the only one.

30:07.012 --> 30:08.381
My god.

30:09.584 --> 30:11.955
What are these things?

30:12.056 --> 30:13.458
Why is this happening?

30:13.559 --> 30:15.395
How should I know?

30:16.364 --> 30:21.107
You think it's a virus, or...
what if it is the fracking?

30:21.207 --> 30:23.244
What if it caused this?

30:23.345 --> 30:24.948
You're blaming me?

30:25.048 --> 30:26.317
You‐ you think
I caused this?

30:26.417 --> 30:28.823
No!

30:28.923 --> 30:31.361
But you did bring
Cleargenix here.

30:34.534 --> 30:35.937
We have to leave.

30:36.437 --> 30:37.306
We can't‐

30:37.406 --> 30:38.041
Now.

30:38.709 --> 30:39.176
I have to get to City Hall.

30:39.945 --> 30:40.580
City Hall? We need
to get Luke!

30:41.314 --> 30:42.884
He's at a party
out by the lake!

30:42.984 --> 30:44.554
How do you know that?

30:44.654 --> 30:46.892
Because he talks to me, Paula.

30:48.395 --> 30:51.935
This city is in crisis, Trey.
I am the mayor!

30:52.036 --> 30:53.438
You're his mother.

30:57.580 --> 30:59.216
Drop me off at City Hall.

30:59.316 --> 31:01.454
You go and get Luke,
then you go home.

31:01.555 --> 31:03.592
You'll be safe there.

31:06.130 --> 31:09.437
[growling and snarling]

31:13.979 --> 31:15.583
Did anybody hear gunshots?

31:15.983 --> 31:17.052
Oh shit!

31:17.987 --> 31:20.358
‐Those are...
‐Yeah, we know.

31:20.459 --> 31:21.528
Come, come on.

31:23.264 --> 31:24.634
Is everything ok?

31:28.007 --> 31:30.011
No. No, come on.

31:35.055 --> 31:36.257
Rhodes: Blackwood!

31:38.461 --> 31:39.965
Blackwood!

31:54.160 --> 31:55.295
Blackwood!

31:57.466 --> 32:00.907
You don't know the kind of
people we're messing with here.

32:03.044 --> 32:04.648
You think I'm the bad guy.

32:06.050 --> 32:07.987
I'm just the messenger.

32:09.991 --> 32:14.935
You go to the cops again,
talk to any reporters...

32:16.037 --> 32:19.009
Oh, they'll do worse

32:22.116 --> 32:24.053
than blow your tire out.

32:32.002 --> 32:33.672
You don't know
these people.

32:37.714 --> 32:42.122
You make yourself inconvenient

32:42.222 --> 32:44.426
and they'll make you disappear.

33:11.180 --> 33:12.517
[gunshot]

33:24.541 --> 33:25.375
[thud]

33:25.475 --> 33:27.212
[groans]

33:44.548 --> 33:46.017
[groans]

33:49.290 --> 33:51.093
Where are you?!

34:02.149 --> 34:03.786
Go home, Blackwood!

34:04.688 --> 34:06.758
Keep your mouth shut!

34:08.461 --> 34:10.566
Maybe you'll stay alive.

34:35.382 --> 34:36.484
[cocks gun]

34:41.327 --> 34:43.131
We leave the way we came in,
through the back.

34:43.231 --> 34:44.534
I'm not going anywhere!

34:45.670 --> 34:47.406
Lady, those things
are gonna kill us.

34:47.507 --> 34:49.143
Yeah, well my friends
live here.

34:49.243 --> 34:51.247
I'm not gonna leave them
to those monsters.

34:51.347 --> 34:52.149
Look, she's right.

34:52.880 --> 34:53.589
These people can't
defend themselves.

34:53.751 --> 34:54.362
It'll be a massacre.

34:54.362 --> 34:55.756
Are you serious?

34:56.825 --> 34:57.459
We don't have time to get
everyone out of here.

34:57.894 --> 34:58.428
Cam, come on.

34:59.096 --> 34:59.864
We can't just abandon them.

35:00.566 --> 35:01.367
It's the greatest generation.

35:02.436 --> 35:02.570
Some of those people might
have walked on the moon.

35:03.438 --> 35:05.676
Nobody here walked
on the moon, kid.

35:05.776 --> 35:07.847
They're people, Lauren.

35:13.826 --> 35:15.696
I fucking hate people.

35:55.976 --> 35:58.381
[bubbling sounds]

36:06.297 --> 36:08.167
Miller?

36:08.267 --> 36:09.269
Hurry up.

36:10.205 --> 36:11.207
I wanna get this thing
out of here ASAP.

36:14.948 --> 36:17.152
[snarling and growling]

36:20.726 --> 36:22.764
[screaming]

36:53.024 --> 36:56.631
[banging]

36:56.732 --> 36:59.269
This way, assholes!

36:59.369 --> 37:00.940
Nice bedpans.

37:01.040 --> 37:02.342
Is this gonna work?

37:02.442 --> 37:03.912
It has to.

37:04.614 --> 37:05.683
[blowing whistle]

37:07.754 --> 37:09.824
[snarling and growling]

37:09.924 --> 37:11.928
[banging]

37:12.028 --> 37:13.532
Stay in your rooms!

37:13.632 --> 37:16.270
There's murderers out here.
They want to kill you!

37:16.370 --> 37:17.406
Jesus Christ, are you trying
to scare them to death?

37:17.507 --> 37:18.976
I'm being honest.

37:19.076 --> 37:20.880
