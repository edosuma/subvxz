-Hey, Carol. Hey, Chuck.
-Hey. Hi.

00:06.429 --> 00:08.033
-Hey.
-Come on in. You guys are early.

00:08.033 --> 00:09.924
Uh, we’re always early.

00:09.924 --> 00:11.825
I’m a Marine,
Carol’s a principal.

00:11.825 --> 00:14.297
-We’re on-time people.
-(Mike chuckles)

00:14.297 --> 00:16.924
Nah, I was late
one time in my life.

00:16.924 --> 00:18.462
Now he’s a sophomore in college.

00:18.462 --> 00:19.825
(Chuck chuckles)

00:19.825 --> 00:21.396
-Come on in, guys.
-All right.

00:21.396 --> 00:23.891
-Where’s Vanessa?
-Uh, she’s also late.

00:23.891 --> 00:25.957
Not your kind of late, but, uh,

00:25.957 --> 00:28.627
her tutoring business has
pretty much outgrown the house,

00:28.627 --> 00:30.396
so she’s driving around
and teaching kids.

00:30.396 --> 00:35.198
She is the only person I know
making money in education.

00:35.198 --> 00:37.495
Well, based on my taxes,
somebody’s getting rich.

00:37.495 --> 00:40.165
(chuckles)
Look, look, we made it a minute

00:40.165 --> 00:43.330
before Baxter complained
about taxes.

00:43.330 --> 00:45.891
And in that minute,
I bet they went up again.

00:45.891 --> 00:47.165
(chuckles)

00:47.165 --> 00:48.693
Listen, while she’s not here,
maybe one of you two

00:48.693 --> 00:50.396
can help me out
with a little gift idea.

00:50.396 --> 00:52.924
-Oh, what’s the occasion?
-Uh, well, her tutoring business

00:52.924 --> 00:54.594
is three years old this week,

00:54.594 --> 00:55.858
so I want
to get her a little something.

00:55.858 --> 00:57.396
-CAROL: Mm.
-Oh, you need help?

00:57.396 --> 00:59.759
God’s gift to gift-giving?

00:59.759 --> 01:01.561
Yeah, well,
I keep upping my game.

01:01.561 --> 01:05.429
I’m like Evel Knievel going,
"Hey, let’s add another bus."

01:05.429 --> 01:06.858
(Chuck laughs)

01:06.858 --> 01:09.000
-That’s just so thoughtful.
-I am.

01:09.000 --> 01:10.759
I’ve been a principal
for two years,

01:10.759 --> 01:13.957
and my husband
hasn’t gotten me squat.

01:15.264 --> 01:16.693
Look at that.

01:16.693 --> 01:19.660
I mention "bus,"
you get tossed under it.

01:19.660 --> 01:22.825
Next time, we wait till we see
Vanessa’s car in the driveway

01:22.825 --> 01:24.891
before we knock on the door.

01:24.891 --> 01:26.858
Hey! Hi, guys.

01:26.858 --> 01:28.561
-Hi.
-Sorry I’m late.

01:28.561 --> 01:30.726
-Hey.
-Been flying all over town.

01:30.726 --> 01:33.033
My last two kids
are ten miles apart.

01:33.033 --> 01:36.264
I have to leave the Wilsons
at 4:31

01:36.264 --> 01:39.033
to get to the Jacksons at 4:51.

01:39.033 --> 01:41.594
So, who can tell me
my average speed?

01:41.594 --> 01:45.396
Honey... you’re, you’re still
in tutor mode.

01:45.396 --> 01:47.198
-You’re off the clock.
-Oh. (chuckles)

01:47.198 --> 01:48.858
-Sorry, sorry, sorry. All right.
-Mwah.

01:48.858 --> 01:50.066
Come on, let’s go,
let’s go, let’s go.

01:50.066 --> 01:51.462
I’m all for that.
(clears throat)

01:51.462 --> 01:53.561
You could tell us all about
your day over some egg rolls.

01:53.561 --> 01:54.924
-Mm-hmm.
-Yeah.

01:54.924 --> 01:56.165
Thirty!

01:59.792 --> 02:01.495
30 miles an hour.

02:01.495 --> 02:03.165
That-that...
that’s the average speed.

02:04.132 --> 02:05.561
That is correct, Mike.

02:05.561 --> 02:07.594
-You get a sticker.
-Great.

02:07.594 --> 02:09.264
I got five stickers.

02:09.264 --> 02:12.825
I get ten, she’s gonna give me
a-a, uh-uh-uh...

02:12.825 --> 02:15.033
You don’t need to know that.

02:23.264 --> 02:24.825
Oh. Hey, hey, hey, Baxter.

02:24.825 --> 02:26.891

for a gift for Vanessa.

02:26.891 --> 02:29.099
-Oh, good.
-Uh, a pen.

02:29.099 --> 02:31.165
-A pen?
-Yeah, a pen.

02:31.165 --> 02:32.693
Wow.

02:32.693 --> 02:34.825
Next year,
I could get her some paper.

02:36.000 --> 02:38.165
You’re an idiot.

02:39.132 --> 02:41.264
I meant, like, a nice pen.

02:42.792 --> 02:45.198
You know,
I actually outdid myself.

02:45.198 --> 02:47.165
I got her something
this morning.

02:47.165 --> 02:49.924
-What is it? Huh?
-Uh, look at that.

02:49.924 --> 02:51.957
Well, if that’s the key
to your heart,

02:51.957 --> 02:54.660
you’re gonna get a kick
in the nuts.

02:54.660 --> 02:56.759
On the way
to the dinner the other night,

02:56.759 --> 02:58.429
I noticed a little office space
for lease.

02:58.429 --> 03:00.528
Perfect
for a small tutoring business.

03:00.528 --> 03:02.660
Leased it this morning.

03:02.660 --> 03:05.693
So, you got her a place to work.

03:05.693 --> 03:09.033
No, no, no. This is tender,
special and particular.

03:09.033 --> 03:11.099
Testicular.

03:12.660 --> 03:14.792
Well, it sounds a lot
like the time

03:14.792 --> 03:17.165
when I got Carol
a vacuum cleaner.

03:17.165 --> 03:19.759
I got real good at using it.

03:24.396 --> 03:26.462
Good morning, Kristin.

03:28.297 --> 03:30.462
Now that I sell
my athleisure line in the store,

03:30.462 --> 03:33.429
I get
to drink the employee coffee.

03:36.198 --> 03:38.726
It’s delicious.

03:39.726 --> 03:41.726
Yeah, uh,
I just cleaned the pot.

03:41.726 --> 03:44.165
You’re mostly drinking vinegar.

03:44.165 --> 03:46.231
I know.

03:48.561 --> 03:50.693
Hi, honey.

03:50.693 --> 03:52.264
Oh, no, no, nope,
no, I’m not "honey."

03:52.264 --> 03:55.231
I’m here on official HR
business, so I’m "Mr. Anderson."

03:55.231 --> 03:57.000
Well, is one of us in trouble?

03:57.000 --> 03:58.759
I don’t know. What’d you do?

03:58.759 --> 04:00.066
Wait. No, no, don’t tell me,

04:00.066 --> 04:01.528
’cause then I’ll have
to start a file,

04:01.528 --> 04:05.693
and then once you have a file,
there’s no going back.

04:05.693 --> 04:08.330
Well, why are you here,
Mr. Anderson?

04:08.330 --> 04:09.858
Well, I was looking
at your record,

04:09.858 --> 04:11.561
and you never took
the employee orientation.

04:11.561 --> 04:13.594
-What’s that?
-Everyone takes it.

04:13.594 --> 04:15.594
You learn about company policy
and workplace safety

04:15.594 --> 04:17.924
and, um, dress code.

04:17.924 --> 04:20.066
Side note-- that skirt is

04:20.066 --> 04:22.099
probably too short.

04:23.033 --> 04:25.264
Watch it.

04:25.264 --> 04:27.264
Yeah, but I mean, I’m your wife,

04:27.264 --> 04:29.924
so I probably don’t have
to take that orientation, right?

04:29.924 --> 04:31.924
(chuckles)
Wrong. Mandatory.

04:32.858 --> 04:34.462
(laughing)

04:35.462 --> 04:37.231
I bet Kristin didn’t take it.

04:37.231 --> 04:39.363
I most certainly did.

04:39.363 --> 04:42.330
Well,
Kristin most certainly did not.

04:43.891 --> 04:45.759
Good catch, Mandy.

04:45.759 --> 04:47.462
I’m going to kill you.

04:47.462 --> 04:49.462
Okay, so, side note--

04:49.462 --> 04:52.462
that’s a threat,
which is a huge no-no.

04:52.462 --> 04:54.462
But you’ll hear more
about that tomorrow

04:54.462 --> 04:56.462
at noon in the conference room.

04:56.462 --> 04:58.462
Oh, and wear comfy clothes.

04:58.462 --> 05:00.660
be activities.

05:05.099 --> 05:07.264
I love our regular dinners
with you guys,

05:07.264 --> 05:08.891
but, uh, honey, where are we?

05:08.891 --> 05:11.660
What is this-- some-some
office-themed restaurant?

05:11.660 --> 05:14.132
Oh, I hope we’re not eating out
of vending machines.

05:14.132 --> 05:17.165
-I already had expired yogurt
and Mentos for lunch.
-(chuckles)

05:17.165 --> 05:20.495
Well, prepare to be amazed--
Suite 104.

05:20.495 --> 05:23.033
This has got "vacuum cleaner"
written all over it.

05:25.198 --> 05:27.297
Well, congratulations
on three years

05:27.297 --> 05:29.033
of Vanessa Baxter Tutoring.

05:29.033 --> 05:30.660
Welcome to your new office.

05:30.660 --> 05:33.363
You rented this for me? Oh.

05:33.363 --> 05:35.495
Oh, my God. Oh, my...

05:35.495 --> 05:38.495
Mike, oh...
This is so thoughtful.

05:38.495 --> 05:40.363
-So, do you like it?
-I do. Oh, my...

05:40.363 --> 05:43.165
-I love it. I love it.
-All right.

05:43.165 --> 05:44.957
-Thank you.
-Mm-hmm.
-Okay, okay, okay.

05:44.957 --> 05:47.825
So, you proved me wrong
and made your wife happy.

05:47.825 --> 05:50.000
The place has already paid
for itself.

05:50.000 --> 05:53.330
Think of all the science
experiments you’ll have in here.

05:53.330 --> 05:55.792
I mean... (sniffs)
it’s starting to smell a lot

05:55.792 --> 05:58.363
-like nerd already.
-(chuckles)

05:58.363 --> 06:00.000
This is an awesome gift, Mike.

06:00.000 --> 06:01.561
You saw what your wife needed,

06:01.561 --> 06:03.330
-and you got it for her.
-Yeah.

06:03.330 --> 06:07.297
I sure hope the other men
in this room are taking notes.

06:08.363 --> 06:10.561
it’s paid for itself.

06:11.726 --> 06:14.066
You have gotten me some amazing
gifts over the years,

06:14.066 --> 06:16.693
-but you have really outdone
yourself on this one.
-Okay.

06:16.693 --> 06:18.132
But I’m not done yet.

06:18.132 --> 06:20.132
-Oh.
-Chuck, I need a little hand

06:20.132 --> 06:23.462
-bringing in the grand finale.
-(scoffs)

06:23.462 --> 06:25.033
-(sighs)
-(gasps)

06:25.033 --> 06:27.231
-There’s a finale?
-(Vanessa chuckles)

06:27.231 --> 06:29.396
I vacuumed the house
before we left.

06:29.396 --> 06:31.330
Did you see that?

06:32.660 --> 06:33.825
(sighs)

06:33.825 --> 06:36.330
Vanessa,
this is something else!

06:36.330 --> 06:38.528
-I...
-You have built an empire.

06:38.528 --> 06:40.033
Well, I don’t know
if I built an empire,

06:40.033 --> 06:42.066
but I-I’ve done pretty well.

06:42.066 --> 06:44.264
I-I get more students
every month.

06:44.264 --> 06:47.033
Well, maybe you have me to thank
for your booming business.

06:47.033 --> 06:49.693
-(chuckles)
-’Cause if my school
wasn’t floundering,

06:49.693 --> 06:52.495
you wouldn’t be so in demand.

06:52.495 --> 06:54.066
-(chuckles)
-I mean, I-I don’t know.

06:54.066 --> 06:56.891
I-I think maybe my students love
to learn.

06:56.891 --> 06:59.924
Oh, yeah,
that’s a book on teenagers.

06:59.924 --> 07:01.825
"They love to learn."

07:03.594 --> 07:06.264
But, hey, you know, I’m-I’m
so happy you’re doing this.

07:06.264 --> 07:08.891
-Oh.
-’Cause the state made
more cutbacks.

07:08.891 --> 07:11.396
So, I’m glad,
’cause at least some of the kids

07:11.396 --> 07:13.132
will be getting
a decent education.

07:13.132 --> 07:14.759
Well, thank you.

07:14.759 --> 07:16.528
I think.

07:16.528 --> 07:18.693
You know what,
forget I said anything.

07:18.693 --> 07:20.891
-Let’s just celebrate
your success, okay?
-W-Wait, no,

07:20.891 --> 07:24.264
but-but-but the success
that I’m apparently only earning

07:24.264 --> 07:26.594
because the school system’s
failing.

07:26.594 --> 07:28.363
Vanessa, no!

07:28.363 --> 07:31.858
I mean, yes, but no.

07:31.858 --> 07:33.627
No, I-I’m being a downer.

07:33.627 --> 07:35.066
It’s just...

07:35.066 --> 07:36.891
we got next year’s budget and...
(sighs)

07:36.891 --> 07:38.726
oh... (sputters)
it’s gonna be brutal.

07:38.726 --> 07:39.957
Oh. Well, great, great.

07:39.957 --> 07:42.297
Because, because the worse
it is for students,

07:42.297 --> 07:43.561
the better it is for me,

07:43.561 --> 07:44.759
and I’m...

07:44.759 --> 07:46.660
I am such a monster.

07:46.660 --> 07:49.429
-You are not responsible
for the bureaucracy.
-I-I know.

07:49.429 --> 07:51.330
-But...
-It is what it is, Vanessa.

07:51.330 --> 07:54.264
Pl-- Listen, if you can make
a buck or two off

07:54.264 --> 07:56.099
of this lousy, broken system,

07:56.099 --> 07:57.825

-No.

No.

07:59.891 --> 08:02.825
So, um, hey,
this is exciting, right?

08:02.825 --> 08:04.231
Mm.

08:04.231 --> 08:05.264

-Okay.

Okay.

09:17.264 --> 09:18.561
I’m always the victim.

09:18.561 --> 09:19.891
Well, the day is still young.

09:19.891 --> 09:21.825
-Huh.
-Okay, here’s the deal.

09:21.825 --> 09:23.660
She thinks
that her tutoring business

09:23.660 --> 09:26.396
is profiting off the back
of a broken school system.

09:26.396 --> 09:28.000
But it’s not?

09:28.000 --> 09:29.759
Yeah, it is.

09:29.759 --> 09:31.033
But it’s fine,

09:31.033 --> 09:33.033
because she’s providing
a valuable service, right?

09:33.033 --> 09:34.858
-(smacks lips) Oh.
-(stammers)

09:34.858 --> 09:37.528
She thinks
she’s a vulture capitalist.

09:37.528 --> 09:40.924
Why do people say that
like that’s a bad thing?

09:40.924 --> 09:42.594
Without the vulture,

09:42.594 --> 09:45.429
the desert would be littered
with dead cowboys.

09:46.594 --> 09:48.693
All right. I’m in.
What’s the play?

09:48.693 --> 09:50.561
Ooh! Does my character have
an "ock-cent"?

09:50.561 --> 09:51.792
Yes. Yes.

09:51.792 --> 09:54.033
You’re from Dumb-landia.

09:54.033 --> 09:56.693
Uh, you moved me out
of Moron-ville?

09:56.693 --> 09:59.924
Well, you-you have
a dual citizenship, okay?

09:59.924 --> 10:02.033
Here’s the truth.
You know, you used to be

10:02.033 --> 10:03.528
a card-carrying commie, right?

10:03.528 --> 10:05.033
Then you turned
into a capitalist

10:05.033 --> 10:06.528
’cause your business
turned a profit.

10:06.528 --> 10:09.462
Well, it’s not
really that simple, Mike.

10:09.462 --> 10:12.198
Well, it’s not that complicated
either.

10:12.198 --> 10:17.033
We just have to convince my wife
that it’s okay to succeed.

10:17.033 --> 10:19.132
I got you, bro.

10:19.132 --> 10:20.957
All right.

10:23.132 --> 10:24.330
Hey. Hey, Ryan!

10:24.330 --> 10:25.660
What are you doing here?

10:25.660 --> 10:27.330
Oh, uh,
quarterly meeting with the boss.

10:27.330 --> 10:28.792
-Oh.
-Yes. Uh, turns out

10:28.792 --> 10:30.660
the pot shop’s turning
quite a nice profit.

10:30.660 --> 10:31.759
Yep, you know me.

10:31.759 --> 10:34.462
All about bagging
them Benjamins.

10:34.462 --> 10:37.891
But y-you remember you were
struggling with your conscience

10:37.891 --> 10:39.627
about that initially, right?

10:39.627 --> 10:41.957
Uh, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I’ll
admit, it was, it was tough.

10:41.957 --> 10:44.066
You know? Uh,
running a successful business

10:44.066 --> 10:45.891
is quite the moral quandary.

10:45.891 --> 10:48.330
It’s like, what do you do
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hthat money?

10:50.000 --> 10:52.858
But, ultimately,
I realized it was a good thing.

10:52.858 --> 10:54.858
Yeah. Greed is good.

10:54.858 --> 10:57.363
Why did we stop saying that?

10:57.363 --> 10:58.660
Well, you never did.

10:58.660 --> 11:02.264
Um, so, so,
what did you do, Ryan?

11:02.264 --> 11:05.099
Well, remember last year when I
was freaking out about the bees?

11:05.099 --> 11:07.759
No, but it’s certainly
in character.

11:07.759 --> 11:10.957
<i>extinction,</i>

11:10.957 --> 11:12.792
and I really wanted to help.

11:12.792 --> 11:14.363
But there was not much
that I could do

11:14.363 --> 11:15.462
other than post about it.

11:15.462 --> 11:16.957
So, when the pot shop took off,

11:16.957 --> 11:18.858
I was able to donate some
of the money

11:18.858 --> 11:21.495
to organizations
that help keep bees alive.

11:21.495 --> 11:25.099
Hmm. Was one of them called
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h<i>\hNeeds?</i>

11:25.099 --> 11:26.330
(coughs)

11:26.330 --> 11:27.891
(sucks air through teeth)

11:27.891 --> 11:30.198
Yeah.

11:30.198 --> 11:31.957
Yeah, no, no, Ryan’s right.
You’re right.

11:31.957 --> 11:34.495
And I’ve been thinking
along the same lines, too.

11:34.495 --> 11:37.330
There is a way to run
my tutoring business

11:37.330 --> 11:40.495
and... feel good about it
at the same time.

11:40.495 --> 11:42.033
Wow, I knew
there was a capitalist

11:42.033 --> 11:43.957
-under those sweet curls.
-No, no, no. No. No, no.

11:43.957 --> 11:46.330
-Yeah.
-I-I’m going to donate

11:46.330 --> 11:48.693
all the tutoring money
to Carol’s school.

11:48.693 --> 11:50.363
-You’re what?
-Mm-hmm.

11:50.363 --> 11:51.726
Ooh. Ooh, ooh.
You know what else?

11:51.726 --> 11:53.330
You don’t need the office,
either.

11:53.330 --> 11:55.462
You could donate that money
to Carol’s school, too.

11:55.462 --> 11:57.792
That’s a great idea.
That is great.

11:57.792 --> 11:59.891
Oh, wow. Wow, thank you.
You know what?

11:59.891 --> 12:02.924
I-I... I feel like a weight has
been lifted off my shoulders.

12:02.924 --> 12:04.759
Hey, hold, wait, yeah, hold...

12:04.759 --> 12:06.330
(Vanessa laughs)

12:06.330 --> 12:07.924
Hey, hold...
Wait.

12:10.264 --> 12:12.198
The Memorial Day sale
here at Outdoor Man

12:12.198 --> 12:13.726
kicks off the summer season,

12:13.726 --> 12:16.429
which is only
a few short weeks away from...

12:16.429 --> 12:17.660
Anybody?

12:18.660 --> 12:20.000
Anybody?

12:20.000 --> 12:23.495
That’s right--
the Outdoor Man family picnic!

12:24.891 --> 12:26.165
Uh, show of hands.

12:26.165 --> 12:27.924
Who likes a sack race?

12:29.660 --> 12:33.066
The family picnic is one of our
four most-sponsored galleries

12:33.066 --> 12:35.033
we have for employees
throughout the year...

12:35.033 --> 12:37.957
-(Kyle continues inaudibly)
-How is he still talking?

12:37.957 --> 12:40.099
He’s been at this for hours.

12:40.099 --> 12:41.693
I don’t know.

12:41.693 --> 12:44.957
I feel like I’m getting roped in
to a time-share.

12:45.924 --> 12:47.858
Let’s make a break for it.

12:47.858 --> 12:49.924
-What? You mean leave?
-Yeah.

12:49.924 --> 12:52.594
-He would see us.
-I know. I have an idea.

12:52.594 --> 12:54.891
Mr. Anderson?

12:54.891 --> 12:56.957
My sister’s experiencing
some pregnancy...

12:59.759 --> 13:02.198
...lady stuff.

13:02.198 --> 13:04.627
What...
Lady stuff?

13:04.627 --> 13:05.924
What is it?

13:05.924 --> 13:07.429
Oh, wait, wait.

13:07.429 --> 13:09.594
It’s medical.
I can’t ask about that.

13:09.594 --> 13:12.066
It’s... it’s fine.
It’s just...

13:12.066 --> 13:15.000
(groaning):
Oh, oh, yeah...

13:15.000 --> 13:16.627
Oh, it hurts a little bit.

13:16.627 --> 13:18.264
-Ow.
-Kris, Kris,

13:18.264 --> 13:20.660
we really need to get ahold
of your O.B....

13:20.660 --> 13:22.693
Wan Kenobi.

13:24.066 --> 13:26.759
Right, my doctor.

13:26.759 --> 13:28.726
Dr. Kenobi.

13:30.066 --> 13:31.099
Oh, yeah, we should...

13:31.099 --> 13:32.627
we should call him right away.

13:32.627 --> 13:34.099
-Do you guys need any help?
-Oh, no, no, no.

13:34.099 --> 13:35.792
We’ll be fine. Just mark down
that we were here.

13:35.792 --> 13:38.330
Enjoy the activities, everybody.

13:38.330 --> 13:40.132
Aw, now they know.

13:43.693 --> 13:46.363
-Mike.
-Hey, Carol.

13:46.363 --> 13:47.825
I just want to say

13:47.825 --> 13:50.528
this donation is
really gonna help our school.

13:50.528 --> 13:52.693
We owe Vanessa
the biggest thank you.

13:52.693 --> 13:55.099
My name is on the check, too.

13:55.099 --> 13:57.858
(chuckles)
Thank you, Mike.

13:57.858 --> 14:01.627
I assume this mess on the
lower right is your signature.

14:01.627 --> 14:03.495
You know, when the check
gets to be a certain amount,

14:03.495 --> 14:06.033
my hand fights me.
Stop it, stop it.

14:06.033 --> 14:08.627
You should really feel good
about this, Mike.

14:08.627 --> 14:11.132
Well, it’s really not about me.
It’s about making my wife happy.

14:11.132 --> 14:13.561
Now, I know Chuck doesn’t
believe in that sort of thing,

14:13.561 --> 14:15.594
but some of us are different.

14:16.561 --> 14:18.297
Oh, hey, I want to say sorry

14:18.297 --> 14:20.858
if I put a damper on your gift
the other night.

14:20.858 --> 14:23.165
You didn’t put a damper
on it, Carol.

14:23.165 --> 14:25.660
You flat-out ruined it.

14:25.660 --> 14:27.726
I was just telling her
the truth.

14:27.726 --> 14:30.396
The schools aren’t cutting it,
and until they get it together,

14:30.396 --> 14:34.066
her tutoring business...
is better than nothing.

14:34.066 --> 14:36.165
God, I should have put that
on the card.

14:36.165 --> 14:38.165
"Congratulations
on the new tutoring business.

14:38.165 --> 14:40.825
It’s better than nothing,
honey."

14:40.825 --> 14:43.660
No. No, it’s those idiots
in the state assembly.

14:43.660 --> 14:46.363
They keep cutting
the public school budget.

14:46.363 --> 14:48.693
Public schools,
public transportation,

14:48.693 --> 14:50.198
public restrooms.

14:50.198 --> 14:52.231
When it has
the word "public" in it,

14:52.231 --> 14:54.495
it’s probably a mess.

14:54.495 --> 14:56.561
Hey, sweetie, ready for lunch?

14:56.561 --> 14:58.660
-Yeah.
-We should probably let Baxter

14:58.660 --> 15:01.033
get to the store
to do some gift shopping.

15:01.033 --> 15:03.858
Yeah. I should buy her a pen
like you told me to.

15:03.858 --> 15:05.528
Hear that, Carol?
He thinks I should

15:05.528 --> 15:08.000
buy my wife a pen.

15:09.429 --> 15:11.759
What is wrong with you?

15:12.693 --> 15:15.726
Well, I meant, like, a nice pen.

15:15.726 --> 15:17.825
With, like,
a leather case and...

15:27.099 --> 15:28.792
Hey, Mike Baxter
for Outdoor Man,

15:28.792 --> 15:30.198
talking about education.

15:30.198 --> 15:32.528
Don’t click away!
Don’t click.

15:32.528 --> 15:34.792
Listen. When I was a kid
at Lincoln High School,

15:34.792 --> 15:36.858
it was like this big fat hoagie,

15:36.858 --> 15:38.561
stuffed with everything
you needed, man.

15:38.561 --> 15:41.264
We had-we had shop class,
where I learned to carve my name

15:41.264 --> 15:42.924
in a board with a router.

15:42.924 --> 15:45.396
Then I hit my friend Paul
with it. (chuckles)

15:45.396 --> 15:48.066
We had driver’s ed,
where I learned to drive a car.

15:48.066 --> 15:50.198
And then I hit
my friend Paul with it.

15:50.198 --> 15:52.066
We even had auto shop,

15:52.066 --> 15:54.594
where I learned how to pound out
a Paul-shaped dent.

15:54.594 --> 15:56.330
Why is that?

15:56.330 --> 15:59.066
That’s because that’s what
our parents’ taxes paid for.

15:59.066 --> 16:02.396
Now, let me show you
what our taxes pay for today.

16:02.396 --> 16:05.165
Look at that.
Wood shop? No more, huh?

16:05.165 --> 16:07.396
Auto shop? Forget about it.

16:07.396 --> 16:09.396
Civics? What’s that?

16:09.396 --> 16:11.627
Home ec,
the only place to meet women?

16:11.627 --> 16:12.924
Forget about that.

16:12.924 --> 16:14.462
Music? Buh-bye.

16:14.462 --> 16:16.660
What do you got left?
Two pieces of bread.

16:16.660 --> 16:18.891
If you’re in California,
it’s gluten-free, made of kale,

16:18.891 --> 16:20.891
and nobody’s eating this stuff.

16:20.891 --> 16:22.891
Even a marine iguana
won’t eat it,

16:22.891 --> 16:25.363
and they’ll eat anything.

16:25.363 --> 16:28.132
Shouldn’t our tax dollars go
into putting delicious hoagies

16:28.132 --> 16:30.198
back in the hands of our kids?

16:30.198 --> 16:33.264
Otherwise, who is going
to hit Paul’s kids?

16:34.858 --> 16:37.000
Uh, Baxter out.

16:42.957 --> 16:44.792
Hey, Kristin.

16:44.792 --> 16:47.198
Mandy told me you’re
feeling better. I’m so glad.

16:47.198 --> 16:48.825
Yeah, yeah.

16:48.825 --> 16:50.660
Way better.
(chuckles)

16:50.660 --> 16:53.198
Thank you for letting me
leave early the other day.

16:53.198 --> 16:54.825
It-it really helped.

16:54.825 --> 16:57.594
And I helped, too,
because we left together,

16:57.594 --> 17:00.429
even though I was loving
that crazy class, babe. So fun.

17:02.000 --> 17:04.000
Yeah, yeah.
It was a pretty special group.

17:04.000 --> 17:06.660
In fact, um,
we made you this card.

17:06.660 --> 17:08.858
Oh. Uh...

17:08.858 --> 17:10.561
"Dear Kristin, we are so glad

17:10.561 --> 17:12.363
"you are taking care
of your family,

17:12.363 --> 17:15.363
because you are part
of our family."

17:16.693 --> 17:17.957
That is so sweet.

17:17.957 --> 17:21.396
Look, Mandy,
they made me a card.

17:21.396 --> 17:23.396
They didn’t make it,

17:23.396 --> 17:25.792
they just signed it.

17:25.792 --> 17:29.330
No.
No, they made it.

17:29.330 --> 17:31.165
And, uh, everyone put their
phone numbers on the back

17:31.165 --> 17:32.858
-in case you need anything.
-(gasps)

17:32.858 --> 17:35.759
Really? I... I didn’t
mean to worry anybody.

17:35.759 --> 17:37.495
You worried me.

17:37.495 --> 17:40.000
(whispering):
You’re worrying me now.

17:40.000 --> 17:42.000
(sighs)
Look, Kyle,

17:42.000 --> 17:44.264
I-I have to
tell you something. I...

17:44.264 --> 17:46.198
There was no doctor.

17:46.198 --> 17:48.165
There was no lady stuff.

17:48.165 --> 17:50.396
It was... it was all just a lie

17:50.396 --> 17:52.429
to get out of the orientation.

17:52.429 --> 17:54.033
(chuckles)
You lied to me

17:54.033 --> 17:55.726
to get out of that
super cool class?

17:55.726 --> 17:57.561
Who even are you?

17:57.561 --> 17:59.231
I don’t understand.

17:59.231 --> 18:01.033
Why would you want
to get out of it?

18:01.033 --> 18:03.363
Well, because I thought it was
all just about store stuff.

18:03.363 --> 18:06.528
And since I grew up in here,
I thought I knew everything.

18:06.528 --> 18:08.759
But it’s not, is it?

18:08.759 --> 18:11.462
It’s about everybody
who works here being a family.

18:11.462 --> 18:15.297
Yes. That’s exactly
what it’s about.

18:15.297 --> 18:17.429
So I think I need
to take it over.

18:17.429 --> 18:19.132
(sighs)

18:19.132 --> 18:21.792
What you just said shows me
that you don’t need to.

18:21.792 --> 18:23.858
You learned the lesson
another way.

18:23.858 --> 18:26.726
Yay, everything’s good.
We should go.

18:26.726 --> 18:29.627
-As for you...
-No, no, no.

18:29.627 --> 18:31.561
I get it, right?
So we’re a big family

18:31.561 --> 18:33.825
and we make cards
and we don’t lie.

18:34.792 --> 18:36.462
No.
I don’t think you get it.

18:36.462 --> 18:38.396
So you will be taking
the orientation again,

18:38.396 --> 18:41.627
and another class
on employee ethics.

18:43.099 --> 18:45.132
What? No, you can’t
do that to me, Kyle.

18:45.132 --> 18:47.000
-I’m your wife.
-No, not here.

18:47.000 --> 18:50.495
Here you’re just
a problem employee.

18:50.495 --> 18:53.198
And I’m starting a file
on you, missy.

18:54.759 --> 18:56.165
I still love you.

18:56.165 --> 18:57.726
(mouthing)

19:02.297 --> 19:04.165
Mike, I already told you I don’t
want the tutoring office.

19:04.165 --> 19:05.396
I understand.

19:05.396 --> 19:06.825
Come in here for a second, okay?

19:06.825 --> 19:08.231
-No big deal.
-(sighs)

19:08.231 --> 19:10.297
Okay.
(clears throat)

19:10.297 --> 19:12.528
-Now, listen...
-All right. What is this?

19:12.528 --> 19:15.099
You want to make a difference
in kids’ lives, right?

19:15.099 --> 19:18.033
Right, by-by donating
to the school.

19:18.033 --> 19:20.165
Yeah, but we know our donation’s
only gonna go so far,

19:20.165 --> 19:21.957
and schools aren’t that high

19:21.957 --> 19:23.660
on the government’s to-do list.

19:23.660 --> 19:25.363
Yeah, but at least
it’s something.

19:25.363 --> 19:27.099
Look, kids don’t have millions

19:27.099 --> 19:29.033
of dollars
to donate to candidates,

19:29.033 --> 19:31.495
and they don’t have lobbyists
fighting for them.

19:31.495 --> 19:33.264
Because they don’t see
the upside.

19:33.264 --> 19:35.759
The upside? No.
They’re our future.

19:35.759 --> 19:38.000
And if you ask me,
that is the investment

19:38.000 --> 19:39.792
we should be making
as a society.

19:39.792 --> 19:41.594
Good point, but nobody’s gonna
ask you, are they?

19:41.594 --> 19:45.231
So you’re going
to have to tell them.

19:45.231 --> 19:49.033
Whoa.
(chuckles) Whoa.

19:49.033 --> 19:51.231
You want me to run for office?

19:51.231 --> 19:52.792
Well, you have a passion
for kids.

19:52.792 --> 19:54.330
I know you can
make a difference.

19:54.330 --> 19:55.891
But you hate government.

19:55.891 --> 19:58.297
Boy, do I hate government.

19:58.297 --> 20:01.825
But capitalism only works
in a functioning democracy.

20:01.825 --> 20:03.726
Wow, maybe you should
run for something.

20:03.726 --> 20:07.363
Ooh.
Way too many skeletons.

20:09.396 --> 20:12.000
But you can have your campaign
headquarters right here.

20:12.000 --> 20:14.396
I’ve got it paid for
at least for another month.

20:14.396 --> 20:17.858
-Well, say I did run. Okay?
-Uh-huh.

20:17.858 --> 20:19.594
And I-I probably wouldn’t win.

20:19.594 --> 20:21.330
I mean, the only thing
I’ve ever run for

20:21.330 --> 20:25.033
is treasurer of the book club,
and-and I came in third.

20:25.033 --> 20:27.363
-Honey, honey.
-What?

20:27.363 --> 20:30.165
Of course you’re not gonna win.

20:30.165 --> 20:33.726
You’re highly qualified.
You don’t have a chance.

20:33.726 --> 20:36.165
Yeah, but-but maybe

20:36.165 --> 20:39.033
it would get people talking
about the education system.

20:39.033 --> 20:41.264
And that’s a good thing.
That’s a good thing, right?

20:41.264 --> 20:43.495
And on top of that,
I retain my title

20:43.495 --> 20:46.363
-as God’s gift to gift-giving.
-(chuckles)

20:46.363 --> 20:48.363
And twice a week, Larabee will
come in and vacuum the place.

20:48.363 --> 20:50.561
-Come on.
-Oh.

20:50.561 --> 20:53.132
All right,
I’ll have to think about it.

20:53.132 --> 20:54.264
-You’ll think about it?
-Yeah.

20:54.264 --> 20:55.462
Already waffling.

20:55.462 --> 20:57.330
You are a politician.

21:04.594 --> 21:06.099
Hey, what’s up, Baxter?

21:06.099 --> 21:08.924
Hey, listen,
happy anniversary, man.

21:08.924 --> 21:10.033
What?

21:10.033 --> 21:11.264
What do you mean, "what?"

21:11.264 --> 21:12.693
This year makes five years

21:12.693 --> 21:13.792
since you’ve been here
at Outdoor Man.

21:13.792 --> 21:15.363
Oh! Hey, that’s right.

21:15.363 --> 21:17.033
-How about that, huh?
-Yeah, congratulations.

21:17.033 --> 21:19.858
You know, and since
I’m God’s gift to gift-giving...

21:19.858 --> 21:22.726
-What?
-I got you something
I know you’ll like.

21:22.726 --> 21:25.165
Oh. (scoffs)

21:25.165 --> 21:27.330
This isn’t a nice pen.

21:27.330 --> 21:30.660
Yeah, but next year
I’m gonna get you some paper.

21:30.660 --> 21:32.825
Mm.

21:32.825 --> 21:34.429
Hey, man.

21:34.429 --> 21:37.462
You stole this from the bank.

21:37.462 --> 21:38.528
Look at that.

21:40.000 --> 21:41.495
