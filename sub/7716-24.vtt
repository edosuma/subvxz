Hello, my name is Oscar I'm an
accountant in Scranton, Pennsylvania

00:06.631 --> 00:07.631
and I am gay

00:07.716 --> 00:11.093
And I'm here to tell you
that, yes it does get better

00:11.636 --> 00:13.303
When I was younger
What? What's he doing?

00:13.388 --> 00:15.180
He's searching out
younger gays.

00:15.598 --> 00:17.850
No, it's just a way
to tell young people

00:17.934 --> 00:20.019
no matter how hard
it gets for them

00:20.103 --> 00:21.311
there's a brighter
future ahead

00:21.396 --> 00:22.604
With you

00:25.942 --> 00:29.862
No matter how hard it gets for you...
Kelly, seriously, I...

00:29.946 --> 00:32.281
Just keep chatting I'm just
checking my makeup in your webcam

00:32.365 --> 00:33.699
Do you not own a mirror?

00:33.783 --> 00:36.243
Webcams make me look the way
I look in my fantasies.

00:36.327 --> 00:39.621
I know, right? What is it? You
always look so good in those things.

00:39.706 --> 00:40.873
I'm throwing out
all my mirrors.

00:40.957 --> 00:42.875
Okay, as you can see

00:42.959 --> 00:45.502
at a dynamic workplace

00:46.296 --> 00:49.548
Being gay is a celebration
of life It's a simple...

00:49.632 --> 00:52.551
I'm sorry. I just
can't sit idly by

00:52.635 --> 00:56.013
and have
the gay youth of America

00:56.097 --> 00:57.556
misled by
some reductionist

00:57.640 --> 00:58.640
I'm not misleading

00:59.476 --> 01:00.851
...pep talk

01:02.604 --> 01:05.480
Sexuality is a spectrum

01:05.565 --> 01:09.651
It's a paradox to think of any
sexual activity as normal

01:10.445 --> 01:14.281
It gets better, but it also
gets vastly more complicated.

01:14.365 --> 01:17.743
Hey, Robert? That guy
he looks just like you

01:18.161 --> 01:20.829
Damn it! Kevin. God

01:24.209 --> 01:25.459
You okay, Robert?

01:25.543 --> 01:26.752
I'm fine

01:26.836 --> 01:28.253
Put some ice on it

01:28.338 --> 01:30.297
In any case,
it gets better

01:33.134 --> 01:36.345
Maybe not much better
but better.

01:37.180 --> 01:38.180
It hurts

01:40.000 --> 01:46.074

01:47.857 --> 01:49.817
One, two, three

01:51.069 --> 01:53.612
I wanted to give a nice gift to
the tenants in the building.

01:53.696 --> 01:55.364
At first I thought,
"Muffin basket."

01:55.448 --> 01:58.283
Then I thought, "What's even more
precious to people than muffins?"

01:58.368 --> 01:59.701
Can you just
smile, please?

02:01.579 --> 02:03.122
Their own children

02:03.581 --> 02:04.623
Hey, everybody

02:04.707 --> 02:07.167
Just a few hours left for the
free family portrait studio.

02:07.252 --> 02:09.502
Darryl, we'd love to see
little Jada come by

02:10.505 --> 02:13.465
Angela, why don't you
bring by your little angel?

02:13.550 --> 02:14.716
No, thank you

02:15.218 --> 02:16.677
Jim, you've got
those two cute kids

02:16.761 --> 02:18.053
We sure would
love to see them

02:18.888 --> 02:20.222
doing this, Dwight

02:20.849 --> 02:23.058
Last week, I may
have gone too far

02:23.852 --> 02:24.810
I'll explain it quickly

02:24.894 --> 02:27.312
Basically I found out where he
gets his clothes dry-cleaned

02:27.397 --> 02:29.523
custom-ordered the same suit
made with tear-away Velcro

02:31.401 --> 02:32.651
and you can
fill in the rest.

02:34.028 --> 02:35.028
What?

02:36.906 --> 02:38.365
Damn it, Jim

02:39.075 --> 02:42.035
Now he's trying to get me to
bring my children into work

02:42.745 --> 02:44.454
I think it's fair
to be cautious

02:45.081 --> 02:48.083
Let me get this straight
you lost all of it?

02:49.252 --> 02:53.422
All your winnings
$150,000?

02:56.759 --> 02:58.343
You mean to tell me
no one wanted

02:58.428 --> 03:00.137
an energy drink
for Asian homosexuals?

03:00.430 --> 03:01.430
They did not

03:01.764 --> 03:04.433
You've got
half-a-million of these?

03:08.271 --> 03:10.230
Well, I've got to try it I wouldn't

03:10.565 --> 03:12.024
Oh, come on.
What's the harm?

03:14.736 --> 03:15.903
Hmm

03:16.821 --> 03:17.821
What flavor is that?

03:20.575 --> 03:22.409
The coconut's pretty subtle

03:22.619 --> 03:24.870
Come on, man. Can you just
give us a yes or a no?

03:24.954 --> 03:28.999
I don't know, man. You all
quit with a lot of confidence

03:29.751 --> 03:33.170
came up in here dancing
and everybody was...

03:33.504 --> 03:35.130
Ooh! Hold on a second

03:39.010 --> 03:42.054
If I were Val, I would
break up with Brandon

03:42.138 --> 03:44.306
Then I would date
the hell out of me

03:44.390 --> 03:45.766
I wouldn't give in
to me too fast,

03:45.850 --> 03:48.477
let me buy myself some
nice dinners and such

03:48.561 --> 03:52.981
When I finally did give in
I would go crazy on myself

04:03.910 --> 04:04.910
Hi, guys

04:05.995 --> 04:06.995
How's it going, man?

04:07.247 --> 04:10.332
I'm... I'm good
Thank you. How are you?

04:11.626 --> 04:12.709
Great, yeah. Good

04:15.755 --> 04:17.964
Oh, how the mediocre
have fallen.

04:20.343 --> 04:21.593
Oh, God

04:21.886 --> 04:23.887
Look, I'm not here
to get my old job back

04:25.515 --> 04:26.556
I'm moving on

04:26.975 --> 04:31.395
Just wanted to come in here
and literally beg you

04:32.188 --> 04:33.605
for something, anything

04:33.690 --> 04:36.275
water the plants.

04:36.359 --> 04:37.484
No, you don't
Clean the toilets

04:37.610 --> 04:39.278
Pull the poop
out of the toilets

04:39.362 --> 04:41.154
Not even a thing.
Just please

04:41.447 --> 04:42.698
Andy. Andy

04:42.782 --> 04:44.616
Please give me something

04:44.701 --> 04:48.704
Why don't you clean
the carpets for today?

04:49.455 --> 04:50.539
Thank you

04:50.623 --> 04:53.041
Well, you're...
Up you get, then

04:54.544 --> 04:56.545
Pick yourself up

04:56.629 --> 04:57.754
There it is.
Thank you

04:57.839 --> 04:59.631
You don't need to

05:11.728 --> 05:14.479
Good, good This carpet's
overdue for a good mopping

05:15.231 --> 05:17.733
Is a mop the most efficient
too to use on a carpet?

05:18.234 --> 05:19.609
Yeah, it is, actually

05:22.030 --> 05:24.448
I can't hold
it in any longer

05:26.451 --> 05:28.744
Because I convinced
David Wallace

05:28.828 --> 05:31.246
to buy Dunder Mifflin
back from Sabre

05:31.831 --> 05:34.499
and at 3:00 today he's
going to walk in here

05:34.584 --> 05:37.377
and reinstate me
as manager

05:38.296 --> 05:40.422
Family picture

05:42.091 --> 05:43.592
Pam. No

05:44.093 --> 05:46.261
What? Honey, we talked
about this.

05:46.387 --> 05:48.513
No, we talked about
not bringing them

05:48.598 --> 05:50.682
into Dwight's photo
studio/trap.

05:50.767 --> 05:52.601
Yes, and then we decided
that was crazy.

05:52.685 --> 05:55.270
No, we decided it was crazy
not to worry about it

05:55.355 --> 05:57.356
No, we settled in a much
more rational place

05:57.440 --> 05:58.440
remember?
No

05:58.524 --> 06:00.692
We decided that there's no way
Dwight would harm a child

06:00.777 --> 06:03.862
But are you 100% sure? I
don't think any of us are

06:03.946 --> 06:05.030
No, no

06:05.114 --> 06:06.114
Nope

06:06.366 --> 06:08.784
But it's free and we'll
keep our eye on them

06:08.868 --> 06:09.868
Yes
Yes, that's

06:09.952 --> 06:11.870
And we will make sure that
Dwight doesn't do anything

06:11.954 --> 06:13.205
Okay
...C-R-A-Z-Y

06:13.289 --> 06:16.124
Wait. C-R-A-Z

06:16.918 --> 06:18.126
Great, right up there

06:18.419 --> 06:19.419
Yeah
Yeah.

06:19.504 --> 06:21.129
You sit right here
one time.

06:21.214 --> 06:22.547
There you go
Okay.

06:22.632 --> 06:23.882
All right, why don't you
just give him to me?

06:23.966 --> 06:25.217
Oh, great. Thank you

06:25.301 --> 06:26.468
Perfect

06:27.261 --> 06:28.261
This is great, excuse me

06:28.346 --> 06:29.346
You ready? There you go

06:29.430 --> 06:30.430
Okay.
All right, let's do it

06:30.515 --> 06:31.765
I'll just stand here then

06:31.891 --> 06:33.433
Yeah, just keep your eye
on Dwight Okay, yeah

06:33.518 --> 06:34.768
Sir, could you
look into the camera?

06:34.852 --> 06:36.478
Let's do it
Shoot it. Great

06:36.562 --> 06:37.729
Sir.
Up here

06:37.814 --> 06:38.980
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

06:39.482 --> 06:42.067
Jim, right here right here.
Okay. Good

06:42.485 --> 06:44.236
Oh, so that's it?
That's it

06:44.320 --> 06:45.737
See, that wasn't so hard

06:45.822 --> 06:47.239
Cute kids
Thanks for coming.

06:49.242 --> 06:52.077
Hello, Erin.
Hello, everybody

06:52.161 --> 06:54.913
What, why? Hi, honey.
What... How are you doing?

06:54.997 --> 06:56.581
You know,
my office got a call

06:56.666 --> 06:59.709
that they were shooting
family portraits right here

06:59.794 --> 07:03.004
And if there's one thing every
politician instinctively understands

07:03.089 --> 07:04.464
it's a good photo op

07:06.217 --> 07:08.385
Okay, you're going to go
through the hallway.

07:08.469 --> 07:10.846
Here's a map And if you get
lost just follow the blue line

07:12.765 --> 07:14.141
Thanks

07:16.018 --> 07:19.187
Well, well, well,
Senator Lipton. Welcome

07:19.647 --> 07:20.730
Angela.
Dwight

07:20.815 --> 07:21.815
Nice to see you

07:21.899 --> 07:23.316
May I hold him?
Sure

07:23.401 --> 07:27.195
No. I am going to hold him because
I haven't seen him all day.

07:27.613 --> 07:30.365
I think that Dwight
is doing this whole thing

07:30.450 --> 07:33.160
to get a sample
of my baby's DNA

07:33.327 --> 07:35.036
to prove he's the father

07:35.913 --> 07:38.039
Which is impossible

07:38.458 --> 07:41.293
Because the Senator is the
only man I've ever been with

07:44.088 --> 07:45.255
Did you see that?

07:45.339 --> 07:47.174
What do you think
about that? See?

07:49.719 --> 07:50.802
See that ducky?

07:50.887 --> 07:52.929
Okay, hold on
a second, folks

07:53.014 --> 07:54.598
A few of the baby's hairs
are out of place

07:54.682 --> 07:56.475
Oh, thank you
No, no, no

07:56.559 --> 07:58.226
I like the baby's hair
the way it is.

07:59.020 --> 08:00.020
Really?

08:00.563 --> 08:03.231
This is getting more and more
delicious by the minute.

08:12.408 --> 08:13.450
It's go time

08:14.410 --> 08:16.536
Hey, Nellie. I made... I made you

08:19.081 --> 08:20.540
Well, I don't
want any soup

08:20.625 --> 08:21.791
But it's really good

08:21.876 --> 08:23.919
Oh! Come on, Andy

08:26.255 --> 08:27.255
Ah

08:35.389 --> 08:37.890
I know this is going
to be a great payoff

08:37.975 --> 08:39.808
A delicious moment

08:40.061 --> 08:41.520
But after you're manager

08:41.645 --> 08:44.814
some of these images are
going to be hard to shake

08:45.858 --> 08:47.817
Well, but it's
Just calibrate.

08:49.195 --> 08:50.612
Okay? Calibrate

08:52.198 --> 08:53.448
Okay, here we go

08:54.116 --> 08:56.326
Oh, you know what? I don't want
to throw a wrench into the works

08:56.410 --> 08:58.245
but I want everything
to be perfect

08:58.329 --> 09:00.121
and the baby's fingernails
are just bothering me.

09:00.289 --> 09:02.165
Uh-uh. Leave us alone

09:02.250 --> 09:03.917
with the fingernails

09:04.085 --> 09:05.961
Okay, great.
Suit yourself

09:08.130 --> 09:09.339
Although

09:09.423 --> 09:11.132
aren't those
excess skin cells

09:11.217 --> 09:13.260
in the baby's cheek
distracting to you as well?

09:13.803 --> 09:15.303
Dwight! We're fine

09:15.846 --> 09:18.723
Oopsie! Did somebody
make a poopsie?

09:19.892 --> 09:22.269
I'm just going to take
him out and change him

09:22.353 --> 09:23.728
just for a second here

09:23.813 --> 09:25.063
He defecated

09:25.147 --> 09:26.147
Ooh
Oh

09:26.232 --> 09:27.357
Stinky

09:27.441 --> 09:30.360
A lot has changed
since you all left, okay?

09:30.444 --> 09:32.654
You're going to have to
jump through some hoops

09:32.738 --> 09:34.239
And the new foreman is here

09:34.574 --> 09:37.617
Now, she's one of the best
we've ever known, okay?

09:37.702 --> 09:40.203
So I need you to show her
your utmost respect

09:40.288 --> 09:42.664
Make sure that
she feels welcome

09:42.748 --> 09:44.624
and at home, okay?
Can you do that?

09:44.709 --> 09:46.918
That's some pretty blatant
complimenting you're doing there, man

09:47.003 --> 09:48.878
I don't even talk to her like that.
- Uh, Brandon

09:50.131 --> 09:51.548
You would?
Yeah.

09:51.882 --> 09:53.133
Sounds like you're trying
to hit on my girlfriend

09:53.217 --> 09:54.426
Calm down. He's not

09:54.510 --> 09:55.635
Yes, I am

09:56.721 --> 09:58.346
Just so everyone's
on the same page.

09:59.307 --> 10:00.515
So you really
think she's going to

10:00.600 --> 10:01.975
leave a guy who owns
his own restaurant

10:02.101 --> 10:04.019
for a dude who ate his own restaurant?
Brandon.

10:05.271 --> 10:06.271
Good slam

10:06.355 --> 10:07.397
Thank you, Biggie

10:07.481 --> 10:08.607
Good luck to you

10:08.691 --> 10:10.108
Oh, and have
a burger for me

10:14.655 --> 10:17.115
Okay, shall we
take a few more?

10:17.199 --> 10:19.993
I think we have all the shots
we need Thank you, Dwight

10:20.077 --> 10:24.039
Okay, here we go
Yes, here we go.

10:34.342 --> 10:38.011
No, Dwight! Give me
the diaper Dwight!

10:48.147 --> 10:50.231
Is this what
you were looking for?

10:50.316 --> 10:52.400
Huh? Huh?

10:55.071 --> 10:56.655
Andy, we wanted
to talk to you.

10:56.739 --> 10:59.741
A lot of us are very
concerned about you

11:00.076 --> 11:05.205
You're dirty, you stink of booze,
you're limping inexplicably

11:05.289 --> 11:07.165
I just want you guys
not to worry

11:07.249 --> 11:09.125
because old Andy's
going to be just fine

11:09.210 --> 11:10.919
No, no, no see, this is
what we're talking about

11:11.587 --> 11:13.672
I mean, what was
that accent?

11:14.090 --> 11:16.633
And last time I checked you were
drunk and now you're not drunk

11:19.428 --> 11:21.388
No, unfortunately
it's true

11:22.264 --> 11:23.473
He's been a nightmare

11:23.808 --> 11:26.351
and the worst part is he's
been taking it out on me.

11:26.852 --> 11:28.144
You hit her?
- What?

11:28.229 --> 11:31.856
No, no
That is not the deal

11:32.692 --> 11:34.067
Calibrate

11:34.360 --> 11:38.613
He's not hitting me, but he's
been verbally abusing me

11:38.864 --> 11:40.448
That is
not true, either

11:40.574 --> 11:44.869
That's also total...
Everyone please relax

11:45.454 --> 11:47.664
I think you're going to
like this surprise guest

11:50.710 --> 11:52.252
Happy birthday to Gabe

11:52.837 --> 11:54.295
Oh, get out,
Skeleton Man

11:58.175 --> 12:00.260
someone to talk to

12:00.344 --> 12:01.386
Huh?

12:01.470 --> 12:03.054
Hold on

12:03.139 --> 12:04.597
I'm just going to... Hello?

12:05.057 --> 12:06.975
Hey, what's the scoop?
Are you close?

12:08.728 --> 12:13.106
What? No, no, no, no, no, no,
no You have to come now.

12:15.151 --> 12:18.403
Traffic clears.
No, next Friday

12:19.071 --> 12:23.658
That's not going to work
Okay, yeah, okay

12:26.162 --> 12:27.162
Damn it

12:28.164 --> 12:31.583
Well, this is not going to be
quite as delicious as I wanted

12:31.667 --> 12:34.586
but I do have a very tasty
announcement for you guys.

12:36.005 --> 12:38.590
Not only am I not
a lowly janitor,

12:38.674 --> 12:41.259
once again

12:41.343 --> 12:43.094
Guys, I got
my old job back

12:43.846 --> 12:45.638
Oh, boy
Oh, Andy

12:45.723 --> 12:49.851
I'm not crazy I convinced David
Wallace to give me my job back

12:50.227 --> 12:52.645
David Wallace hasn't
worked here in years.

12:52.730 --> 12:54.731
Okay, yes
I see the confusion

12:54.815 --> 12:56.483
at the fundraiser

12:56.567 --> 12:58.318
He is now
a multi-millionaire

12:58.402 --> 13:00.612
because he sold
his toy vacuum "Suck It'

13:00.696 --> 13:02.030
to the U.S. Military

13:02.364 --> 13:04.199
Andy, come on, man

13:04.283 --> 13:06.993
I... Okay, I get how
that sounds crazy.

13:07.077 --> 13:10.121
Andy, nobody's calling
you crazy, Andy.

13:10.206 --> 13:11.790
We're your friends, Andy

13:11.874 --> 13:13.082
Stop saying my name

13:13.167 --> 13:15.168
No, he's not making this up.
Thank you, Erin

13:15.252 --> 13:17.879
Andy tells me about seeing
David Wallace all the time

13:18.714 --> 13:21.800
But have you ever
actually seen him yourself?

13:23.886 --> 13:25.345
Oh, my God. Wait

13:25.429 --> 13:27.180
Erin, come... Come on

13:27.807 --> 13:30.141
You know I've been
talking to David Wallace

13:30.226 --> 13:33.937
Do you see David Wallace
in the room right now?

13:42.613 --> 13:46.199
Operation Phoenix is a go
Just get the car ready

13:47.868 --> 13:48.952
Okay, you look at me
like you're adoring me

13:49.036 --> 13:49.994
and I'm going to
look at the camera

13:50.079 --> 13:51.079
like I don't even
know you're there

13:51.163 --> 13:52.497
But I do adore you

13:59.255 --> 14:01.089
Andrew, it's time
for you to go home

14:02.466 --> 14:03.883
You're better than this

14:04.635 --> 14:06.010
Yeah, I know

14:06.095 --> 14:07.387
Everyone is
better than this

14:07.471 --> 14:11.599
Because this is the worst
thing I have ever seen

14:16.605 --> 14:18.898
Why did they add coconut?
I miss original.

14:19.650 --> 14:21.526
Hey.
- Hey

14:21.610 --> 14:23.111
Hey, guys
- Hey

14:23.195 --> 14:24.779
Hey, guys, long time

14:25.197 --> 14:26.739
David, what are
you doing here?

14:26.824 --> 14:28.783
Is it true you're
buying the company?

14:28.951 --> 14:31.828
Okay, I guess
the word is out

14:32.288 --> 14:36.207
Please keep this a secret but
yes, I've been talking with Andy.

14:36.292 --> 14:39.210
What? I thought
I heard my name. What?

14:39.962 --> 14:41.462
I'm the new manager?

14:41.547 --> 14:42.922
I'll get to that
in a second, Andy

14:43.007 --> 14:45.800
But it's
It is me? Right?

14:45.885 --> 14:46.968
Yes
as we discussed

14:47.052 --> 14:48.136
What?

14:48.846 --> 14:50.305
Oh, my God

14:50.389 --> 14:51.806
It's very possible
Probable.

14:51.891 --> 14:53.558
Wow. From janitor
to manager?

14:53.642 --> 14:54.642
Yep

14:55.269 --> 15:00.148
It's quite a Cinderella story.
From M-O-P to MVP

15:01.275 --> 15:03.234
There's an official
announcement A few details...

15:03.319 --> 15:06.946
From total loss
to total boss. I mean

15:07.031 --> 15:08.990
Can we expect
any payroll interruptions?

15:09.074 --> 15:10.867
Now that is
a great question, Stanley

15:10.951 --> 15:12.243
Right now I think
all your operations

15:12.328 --> 15:14.746
or most of your operations are
pretty much down in Florida,

15:14.830 --> 15:15.914
so the shift back

15:15.998 --> 15:21.085
I was so looking forward
to that and it did not go

15:21.170 --> 15:23.129
as I thought it would

15:40.522 --> 15:42.607
So we're not going to be
a part of Sabre anymore?

15:42.691 --> 15:44.734
Actually nothing is going to
be a part of Sabre anymore

15:44.818 --> 15:47.278
Jo Bennett's planning on liquidating
the rest of the company

15:47.863 --> 15:49.864
Oof!

15:50.324 --> 15:53.201
Wouldn't want to be a Sabre
employee right about now.

15:55.079 --> 15:57.038
I'm actually the CEO

15:57.414 --> 15:58.498
Ah

15:58.582 --> 15:59.958
I didn't realize
you were standing there

16:00.042 --> 16:01.334
Hey, my friend, trust me

16:01.418 --> 16:04.796
This is for the best I never
understood that corporate mess

16:04.880 --> 16:06.798
Well, okay.
Well, great to meet you

16:06.882 --> 16:08.841
Likewise, I'm Bob
Bob Kazamakis.

16:09.343 --> 16:10.385
Pleasure

16:10.594 --> 16:12.387
I'd love to give you
a little rundown

16:12.471 --> 16:14.180
on what I've learned
about this place.

16:14.264 --> 16:15.848
That's very
gracious of you, Bob

16:15.933 --> 16:17.642
Please

16:22.523 --> 16:25.525
I guess I better
take off these dirty rags

16:26.944 --> 16:30.071
and figure out how to be
a manager of this place.

16:30.781 --> 16:32.281
Perhaps your
year of experience

16:32.366 --> 16:34.158
managing this branch
will come in handy.

16:34.243 --> 16:35.410
Gosh, I hope so

16:41.000 --> 16:42.959
No! God, Mose. God

16:43.043 --> 16:44.168
Hi, Angela

16:44.253 --> 16:46.337
Get out of the car
Get out!

16:48.340 --> 16:50.216
Where is he? Where is he?

16:50.300 --> 16:52.343
I'm not supposed to say
Yes, tell me!

16:52.428 --> 16:53.678
Tell me where he is

16:55.431 --> 16:58.182
Mose! Damn it
Where did he go?

16:58.267 --> 17:00.268
Mose, get back here

17:03.439 --> 17:04.939
See that smile

17:10.112 --> 17:11.529
Jump in here
Come on

17:36.138 --> 17:39.474
Looks like I might get my
delicious moment after all.

17:40.476 --> 17:41.809
May I say one thing?

17:42.269 --> 17:46.773
It would be rude of me not to let
you say whatever's on your mind

17:48.317 --> 17:50.818
"The quality of mercy
is not strained.'

17:51.820 --> 17:52.904
No

17:52.988 --> 17:57.325
"It dropeth as the gentle rain from
heaven upon the place beneath."

17:57.951 --> 18:00.661
Do not bring Shakespeare
into this

18:00.746 --> 18:03.081
How dare you play
the "Bard Card."

18:03.165 --> 18:06.751
"It blesseth he who gives
and he who takes.

18:06.835 --> 18:09.170
"'Tis mightiest
in the mightiest.'

18:09.588 --> 18:13.841
one mother *
delicious moment.

18:14.802 --> 18:16.511
Is that too much to ask?

18:21.141 --> 18:23.559
If I were to
hire you back, if

18:25.479 --> 18:27.647
what do you think
you would do well?

18:28.357 --> 18:30.525
Special projects manager
That's my background.

18:30.609 --> 18:32.568
Doing whatever I want

18:32.653 --> 18:36.322
All right, you sly bastard
when can you start?

18:46.917 --> 18:48.376
Okay, everyone

18:49.711 --> 18:51.420
with Bob

18:51.505 --> 18:54.549
and since I am going to be CEO
now, there'll be no need for him

18:54.800 --> 18:57.218
Ouch! That's got to hurt

18:57.302 --> 19:00.263
But he is going to make so much
money from the liquidation,

19:00.347 --> 19:01.430
he's going to be
freed up to do

19:01.557 --> 19:03.224
something much more important.
What?

19:03.308 --> 19:08.980
David has generously offered to
donate $1,000,000 in matching funds

19:09.064 --> 19:12.233
to a cause
that's very dear to me

19:12.526 --> 19:15.945
So for the next three years
I'll be traveling overseas,

19:16.238 --> 19:20.324
concentrating all of my efforts
on educating, mentoring

19:20.576 --> 19:25.454
some African, some Asian, but
mainly Eastern European women

19:26.039 --> 19:27.540
I had no idea
how pervasive

19:27.624 --> 19:29.083
this problem was until
Bob explained it to me

19:29.168 --> 19:32.044
Oprah Winfrey's
Leadership Academy

19:32.129 --> 19:35.923
and other schools like it while
wonderful, end with high school.

19:36.008 --> 19:38.259
I want to see these girls
right through college.

19:38.343 --> 19:40.178
Especially the gymnasts

19:40.262 --> 19:45.850
They've lost so many years
of crucial education

19:45.934 --> 19:47.435
to perfecting their bodies

19:47.519 --> 19:50.104
Muscle groups the rest
of us can't even fathom

19:50.939 --> 19:54.692
Gymnasts? You're going to
seek out uneducated gymnasts?

19:54.776 --> 19:59.864
Yeah. So I'm hoping to identify
some truly exceptional women

19:59.948 --> 20:02.283
who show great promise

20:02.951 --> 20:05.161
Well, Andy, it's been fun

20:05.329 --> 20:06.454
Hmm

20:15.547 --> 20:17.131
It's been a great year

20:24.473 --> 20:26.349
Hello
Where is it?

20:27.809 --> 20:29.393
They're testing it now

20:29.478 --> 20:31.103
How long does it take
to get the results?

20:31.188 --> 20:32.563
Seventy-two hours

20:32.648 --> 20:33.981
You're going to wait here?

20:34.816 --> 20:36.108
Yes

20:52.668 --> 20:55.127
Dwight, I can't do this
Dwight

21:07.266 --> 21:08.849
Hey
Senator Lipton.

21:08.934 --> 21:10.059
Hey, how are you?

21:10.143 --> 21:11.185
You didn't call

21:11.979 --> 21:12.979
Um

21:13.063 --> 21:15.815
Well, the issue
that concerned me

21:15.899 --> 21:17.525
You know what
this is about.

21:18.777 --> 21:19.860
