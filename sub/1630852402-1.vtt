[device beeps]

00:22.190 --> 00:24.325
- Oh, shit. He's on it.
- Fuck it, it's gonna go.

00:24.392 --> 00:26.827
[device beeps]
- Oh, shit. Whoa.

00:26.894 --> 00:28.729
- Oh, shit, shit, shit!
Shit, shit!

00:28.796 --> 00:31.031
Shit, shit, shit, shit!
Ah, shit! Ah!

00:31.099 --> 00:32.600
Hey! Hey, somebody!

00:32.666 --> 00:34.568
Call the fire department.
Get the car.

00:34.635 --> 00:36.804
We're gonna have to call
air traffic control.

00:36.870 --> 00:39.673
- [whimpering]

00:39.740 --> 00:41.041
- I don't see him.
I don't see him.

00:41.109 --> 00:42.243
Ah!
- He's right there.

00:42.310 --> 00:43.811
He looks like Gonzo up there.

00:43.877 --> 00:45.446
- There he is!
There he is!

00:45.513 --> 00:47.047
- Hey!
- Jim!

00:47.115 --> 00:48.482
It's Trudy!

00:48.549 --> 00:49.917
Take one of these.

00:49.983 --> 00:53.053
Jim, Jim, this is Trudy Wiegel
on the radio.

00:53.121 --> 00:54.722
Over, 192.

00:54.788 --> 00:56.757
- Hey, Trudy. Go for Jim.
- This is Raineesha.

00:56.824 --> 00:58.659
She wants to say something
to you, Jim.

00:58.726 --> 01:01.929
- Dangle, I see your nuts!

01:01.995 --> 01:03.997
- That can't be the first
time, can it, Rai-Rai?

01:04.064 --> 01:05.533
- Jim!

01:05.599 --> 01:09.069
- So I'm still over Nevada
airspace, yes?

01:09.137 --> 01:11.339
- You're confirmed
over Nevada airspace, Jim.

01:11.405 --> 01:12.640
If you could just take
a little peeksy

01:12.706 --> 01:14.175
inside my neighbor's backyard,

01:14.242 --> 01:16.144
because I think she may
have stolen my weed whacker.

01:16.210 --> 01:18.412
I would much appreciate it.
Over, 10-4, good buddy.

01:18.479 --> 01:21.182
- Trudy, that's a confirmation
on the weed whacker.

01:21.249 --> 01:23.284
It does look like it is
in your neighbor's yard.

01:23.351 --> 01:25.519
Is there--not that you guys
aren't being helpful,

01:25.586 --> 01:26.954
is there anyone on the ground

01:27.020 --> 01:28.422
who could give me ground
support, do you think?

01:28.489 --> 01:29.957
- Um...

01:31.659 --> 01:33.961
- He's heading toward
the Bowling Hall of Fame, Clem.

01:34.027 --> 01:35.729
You got to head him off.

01:35.796 --> 01:37.698
- Yeah, I'm all over it.
I got eyes on him right now.

01:37.765 --> 01:40.768
I'm chasing him at 90 miles
an hour down 395. Stand by.

01:42.536 --> 01:44.037
I don't fucking care.

01:44.104 --> 01:46.440
- He keeps going like this,

01:46.507 --> 01:48.108
pretty soon he'll be out
of our jurisdiction.

01:48.176 --> 01:49.843
- We'll see about that.

01:49.910 --> 01:52.180
- Hey, guys, and good news.
I found my Go-Gurt.

01:52.246 --> 01:53.414
[gunshots]

01:53.481 --> 01:54.882
Shit.

01:54.948 --> 01:56.150
What?

01:56.217 --> 01:57.718
[gunshots]

01:57.785 --> 01:58.952
They're shooting at me!

01:59.019 --> 02:01.054
- But they're not hitting
anything.

02:01.121 --> 02:02.723
[gunshots]
- Damn it!

02:02.790 --> 02:05.092
- Oh, shit. Sorry, Jim.

02:05.159 --> 02:06.660
- Whoo-hoo!

02:06.727 --> 02:08.396
Norman Reedus's company
makes these.

02:08.462 --> 02:09.897
[grunts]

02:09.963 --> 02:11.399
Ah, shit.

02:11.465 --> 02:13.634
Ah! Oh!

02:13.701 --> 02:15.869
- [laughs]
- Don't worry, guys.

02:20.974 --> 02:22.276
- [yelping]

02:22.343 --> 02:24.111
[screams]

02:24.178 --> 02:25.513
[all shouting]

02:29.517 --> 02:32.620
[dog barking]

02:34.121 --> 02:35.756
I'm actually okay.

02:35.823 --> 02:37.725
[bicycle bell dings]
all: Oh!

02:37.791 --> 02:39.860
- Except my spine!
I don't have a spine anymore!

02:39.927 --> 02:43.063
- Go, go, go, go.

02:43.130 --> 02:46.066
[heroic music]

02:46.133 --> 02:49.237
* *

02:49.303 --> 02:51.839
- These last few years have
been a nightmare to be a cop.

02:51.905 --> 02:53.541
You're walking on eggshells,

02:53.607 --> 02:55.476
and it's twice as bad
for someone like me.

02:55.543 --> 02:57.144
Maybe, like,
a hundred times as bad,

02:57.211 --> 02:58.979
because I hate everybody.

02:59.046 --> 03:02.015
I literally
can't stand humanity.

03:02.082 --> 03:05.719
So for me, I got to get over
hating everybody,

03:05.786 --> 03:08.689
or my individual hatreds
come off like prejudice.

03:08.756 --> 03:11.158
I'm a good guy.
I treat everybody the same.

03:11.225 --> 03:12.593
I fucking hate them.

03:12.660 --> 03:14.995
- It's been a bad year
for cops, man.

03:15.062 --> 03:17.831
Between the Antifa/
Black Lives Matter guys

03:17.898 --> 03:19.500
that have been trying
to defund us

03:19.567 --> 03:23.771
and the Blue Lives Matter crowd
that actively tried to kill us,

03:23.837 --> 03:26.774
I should have been a fucking
garbageman like Dad said.

03:26.840 --> 03:28.709
- To be honest,
I thought I was gonna skate--

03:28.776 --> 03:30.544
skate by, 'cause,
you know, I'm...

03:31.712 --> 03:34.147
I'm the hip-hop cop,
you know?

03:34.214 --> 03:35.215
People like me.

03:35.283 --> 03:38.051
But it turns out they, uh...

03:38.118 --> 03:39.520
they lumped me in.

03:39.587 --> 03:41.655
They lumped me in,
and they hate me too.

03:43.223 --> 03:44.358
- Good morning, gang.

03:44.425 --> 03:45.559
- Mm.
- I hate it here.

03:45.626 --> 03:46.527
- Good morning.

03:46.594 --> 03:48.829
- [sighs]

03:53.434 --> 03:55.636
[exhales]

03:55.703 --> 03:58.572
I know it's been
a rough couple of years.

03:58.639 --> 04:00.341
- Suck a dick, asshole.

04:00.408 --> 04:02.476
- You're absolutely allowed
to vent like that.

04:02.543 --> 04:06.079
Declan, the next time you feel
that rage, and I know--

04:06.146 --> 04:08.115
Are you on the--
you're on your meds, yeah?

04:08.181 --> 04:09.517
- Yeah.
- What are they giving you?

04:09.583 --> 04:10.851
- LSD.

04:10.918 --> 04:12.953
Everything's fuzzy
on the edges and drips.

04:13.020 --> 04:14.455
- That's okay.

04:14.522 --> 04:16.557
But you're not thinking
about hurting anybody, right?

04:16.624 --> 04:18.225
- Oh, yeah. All the time.

04:18.292 --> 04:20.561
Whatever Dr. Migifingers
has prescribed to you

04:20.628 --> 04:22.530
to get through
this trying time,

04:22.596 --> 04:23.864
stick with that.

04:23.931 --> 04:25.866
- Why can't we all
just get along, guys?

04:25.933 --> 04:27.701
Right?
- How come she's doing okay?

04:27.768 --> 04:29.837
I don't get it.
She was the most fucked-up one

04:29.903 --> 04:31.805
out of all of us,
and somehow she's doing okay.

04:31.872 --> 04:33.707
[alarm chimes]
- [exhales]

04:33.774 --> 04:37.010
- Sorry, that was
my medication alarm.

04:39.012 --> 04:41.582
- Holy shit.
- That's quite a selection.

04:41.649 --> 04:45.686
- White wakes me up,
blue calms me down.

04:45.753 --> 04:50.257
Orange keeps the demons
from dancing all around.

04:50.324 --> 04:52.092
And then this blue one

04:52.159 --> 04:53.561
is so I don't get
bloating and gas,

04:53.627 --> 04:55.363
and that I don't
shit my pants.

04:55.429 --> 04:56.697
- What is going on?

04:56.764 --> 04:58.065
- How do I get me
some of that?

04:58.131 --> 04:59.900
- You just call the lady
and say,

04:59.967 --> 05:02.470
"I'm thinking about
harming myself and others."

05:02.536 --> 05:04.171
You have to say "and,"
not "or."

05:04.237 --> 05:06.674
- Oh, you said "and others."
- And others. That's it.

05:06.740 --> 05:08.275
It's the "and others."

05:08.342 --> 05:10.711
Uh, in other news,
everybody knows Pizza Midget.

05:10.778 --> 05:13.113
- Oh, yeah, they got them
little midget pizzas.

05:13.180 --> 05:15.549
- Yeah, um, so apparently
this Q...

05:15.616 --> 05:18.151
or QAnon,
whatever that is,

05:18.218 --> 05:21.622
has been, uh, saying defamatory
things about them

05:21.689 --> 05:22.856
on their message boards
and such.

05:22.923 --> 05:24.592
- Pedophile ring
in the basement.

05:24.658 --> 05:26.627
- That's what they said,
but to my knowledge,

05:26.694 --> 05:28.529
there is not a pedophile ring
in the basement.

05:28.596 --> 05:29.730
- No.
- Do they have a basement?

05:29.797 --> 05:31.198
- They don't even
have a basement.

05:31.264 --> 05:32.800
- No, they don't even
have a pinball machine.

05:32.866 --> 05:34.267
- So that explains
this document.

05:34.334 --> 05:37.538
So what's happening is
Pizza Midget

05:37.605 --> 05:40.574
is suing Q

05:40.641 --> 05:41.975
for libel.

05:42.042 --> 05:44.612
And we need to--
- Like "QAnon" Q?

05:44.678 --> 05:46.680
- Yes. The actual Q.

05:46.747 --> 05:49.517
We need to put this in the hand

05:49.583 --> 05:51.251
and serve Q.

05:51.318 --> 05:53.454
- How are we supposed
to find Q?

05:53.521 --> 05:56.156
The whole thing about Q
is that nobody knows where Q is.

05:56.223 --> 05:58.191
- Does nobody know--
- That's the whole thing.

05:58.258 --> 05:59.427
- Is Q even a person?

05:59.493 --> 06:00.694
- We got to put it in the trunk

06:00.761 --> 06:02.195
of Mr. "Snuffleufagus."

06:02.262 --> 06:04.398
- All right, wait,
are you saying "Snuffleufagus"

06:04.465 --> 06:05.833
or "-upagus"?

06:05.899 --> 06:07.267
- "-Ufagus."
- Uh-uh.

06:07.334 --> 06:08.969
- Is it "-upagus"?
- It's "-upagus."

06:09.036 --> 06:10.871
- Oh, my God, dude,
don't get into this again.

06:10.938 --> 06:13.240
- I got to get into it.
I have to get into it.

06:13.306 --> 06:15.108
Om break!

06:16.209 --> 06:18.278
all chanting: Om.

06:18.345 --> 06:19.580
- It's "-upagus."

06:19.647 --> 06:21.482
[guitar strums]

06:21.549 --> 06:24.818
- Click on that article
about the Hollywood cabal...

06:24.885 --> 06:27.054
- There it is.
- See if there's something like,

06:27.120 --> 06:28.321
"If you want to contact Q,
click here."

06:28.388 --> 06:30.357
- Contact Q.
- Look at all them people

06:30.424 --> 06:32.092
they said is pedophiles.

06:32.159 --> 06:33.527
- Yeah.
- Oh, my God.

06:33.594 --> 06:35.128
- Tom Hanks?
- Yeah.

06:35.195 --> 06:37.197
- I mean, those are some
ugly-looking white people.

06:37.264 --> 06:40.233
- Steven Spielberg
has actual horns?

06:40.300 --> 06:41.935
Oh, click on the pillow guy.
The pillow guy.

06:42.002 --> 06:44.004
- [overlapped chatter]
- Oh, the pillow guy!

06:44.071 --> 06:45.639
- There's so many
I could click on, guys.

06:45.706 --> 06:47.508
- Hey, look at that.
- Okay.

06:47.575 --> 06:49.242
- Q's Booze Cruise.

06:49.309 --> 06:50.678
They're having a convention
on a boat.

06:50.744 --> 06:52.079
- They're actually having--yes.

06:52.145 --> 06:55.182
"Leaving from Panama, Florida,
to Nassau.

06:55.248 --> 06:57.918
Fun events, lectures,
get together with QAnon..."

06:57.985 --> 06:58.986
- I will volunteer.
- I'm dialing the number.

06:59.052 --> 07:00.420
I'm dialing. I'm dialing.
- I'm in.

07:00.488 --> 07:01.789
- I will volunteer to do this.
- I want to do this.

07:01.855 --> 07:03.190
- Nobody sound like a cop!

07:03.256 --> 07:04.692
- Uh, yeah, hi.

07:04.758 --> 07:06.827
Um, I saw your--
the ad for, uh, the--

07:06.894 --> 07:08.696
the Q's Booze Cruise.
- Hey, honey!

07:08.762 --> 07:09.997
Are you on the phone?

07:10.063 --> 07:11.231
- [in high-pitched voice]
Yes, Daddy.

07:11.298 --> 07:12.833
- Sorry, I have many,
many children

07:12.900 --> 07:15.335
who need my attention.

07:15.402 --> 07:16.904
- Daddy, I'm hungry!

07:16.970 --> 07:18.672
- [in Southern accent]
I'm here too, Daddy!

07:18.739 --> 07:20.040
- I have a blended family,

07:20.107 --> 07:21.909
and my children
are always pulling at me

07:21.975 --> 07:23.911
in a million directions.
Ha, ha, ha.

07:23.977 --> 07:26.013
I-I saw the posting
on our amazing--

07:26.079 --> 07:29.783
our amazing Q site
for the Q's Booze Cruise.

07:29.850 --> 07:31.952
Oh, that leaves on--
that leaves on Wednesday.

07:32.019 --> 07:34.922
Uh, is the big guy
gonna be there?

07:36.156 --> 07:39.092
Are there nine slots available?

07:39.159 --> 07:41.662
There are?
Great, great, great.

07:41.729 --> 07:43.063
And how much--
how much are those?

07:44.965 --> 07:46.734
Do you have anything
cheaper than that?

07:46.800 --> 07:48.435
You do?

07:48.502 --> 07:50.003
Do you have anything
slightly cheaper than that?

07:50.070 --> 07:51.505
That sounds amazing.

07:51.572 --> 07:52.873
Great. Nine.

07:52.940 --> 07:54.842
- Yes! Yes!
- Where we go one, we go all!

07:54.908 --> 07:56.176
[all cheer]

07:56.243 --> 07:57.645
- * Who let the dogs out? *

07:57.711 --> 07:59.880
* Who, who, who, who? *

07:59.947 --> 08:01.081
* Who let the dogs out? *

08:01.148 --> 08:02.983
* Who, who, who, who? *

08:03.050 --> 08:05.118
* Who let the dogs out? *

08:05.185 --> 08:06.720
* Who, who, who, who? *

08:06.787 --> 08:10.724
* Who let the dogs out? *

08:10.791 --> 08:12.092
- Ah. Stop.

08:12.159 --> 08:13.193
[coughs]

08:13.260 --> 08:15.128
- [speaking foreign language]

08:15.195 --> 08:16.163
- Junior Jr.,
please don't paint

08:16.229 --> 08:17.297
the police car, Junior Jr.

08:17.364 --> 08:18.966
- I want to paint
the police car,

08:19.032 --> 08:20.634
and I'm gonna do it anyway!

08:20.701 --> 08:22.803
- I don't mind getting out
of town for a couple of days.

08:22.870 --> 08:24.437
* *

08:24.504 --> 08:26.206
- * Who let the dogs out?
Who, who, who, who? *

08:26.273 --> 08:27.741
- [screams]

08:27.808 --> 08:29.577
- * Who let the dogs out? *

08:29.643 --> 08:31.411
* Who, who, who, who? *

08:31.478 --> 08:34.081
* Who let the dogs out?
Who, who, who? *

08:34.147 --> 08:37.050
- It just goes to show you
that vision-boarding works.

08:37.117 --> 08:41.521
And I am gonna land me
a bajillionaire,

08:41.589 --> 08:43.256
because that is what I deserve.

08:43.323 --> 08:45.125
[laughs]

08:45.192 --> 08:46.359
Oh!

08:46.426 --> 08:48.829
- Ah! Freedom!

08:48.896 --> 08:50.463
* *

08:50.530 --> 08:51.699
God, I hate this city.

08:51.765 --> 08:53.366
- What's in the box,
you ask?

08:53.433 --> 08:54.968
[chuckles]

08:55.035 --> 08:57.337
No one asked that.
I just said it rhetorically.

08:57.404 --> 08:59.940
I have some friends
in the box.

09:00.007 --> 09:02.610
Some friends who are my ticket

09:02.676 --> 09:05.979
out of this shithole.

09:06.046 --> 09:07.615
- Sitting for paying
customer only.

09:07.681 --> 09:09.850
- I am going to buy something!

09:09.917 --> 09:11.952
- * Who let the dogs out? *

09:12.019 --> 09:13.954
* Who, who, who, who? *

09:14.021 --> 09:15.823
* Who let the dogs out? *

09:15.889 --> 09:17.090
* Who, who, who, who? *

09:17.157 --> 09:18.792
- My old friend, the sea.

09:18.859 --> 09:20.560
Mic check. Mic check.

09:20.628 --> 09:22.162
This is Johnny Tremain.

09:22.229 --> 09:24.698
- * Who let the dogs out?
Who, who, who, who? *

09:24.765 --> 09:26.800
* Who let the dogs out? *

09:26.867 --> 09:28.869
* Who, who, who, who? *

09:28.936 --> 09:30.704
* Who let the dogs out? *

09:30.771 --> 09:32.339
* Who, who, who, who? *

09:32.405 --> 09:34.241
* Who let the dogs out? *

09:34.307 --> 09:36.810
* Who, who, who, who? *

09:36.877 --> 09:38.812
- Welcome to Q's Booze Cruise.

09:38.879 --> 09:40.881
Where we go one,
we go all...

09:40.948 --> 09:43.817
to shuffleboard, on Deck 3.

09:43.884 --> 09:46.219
- Thank you,
and have a patriotic day.

09:46.286 --> 09:48.689
Don't forget
to own the libs.

09:48.756 --> 09:49.857
- Oh, hi.
- Hello!

09:49.923 --> 09:51.358
Welcome to Cruise--
Blue's Clues--

09:51.424 --> 09:54.094
Welcome to Q's
Booze Cruise.

09:54.161 --> 09:56.163
- [laughs]
Yeah. Nailed it.

09:56.229 --> 09:59.132
- Thank you.
- Hi. I'm, uh, John Tremain.

09:59.199 --> 10:00.801
- Oh.
- I'm a disgruntled, uh--

10:00.868 --> 10:02.535
- Ooh, a double-platinum
elegance package.

10:02.602 --> 10:04.071
- That's us. That's us.
- Love it.

10:04.137 --> 10:05.806
- Just sign in here.
- Right.

10:05.873 --> 10:09.142
John Tremain.
- Mm-hmm.

10:09.209 --> 10:10.978
- And the job: laborer.
Disgruntled laborer.

10:11.044 --> 10:12.579
- Yes.
- Thank you so much.

10:12.646 --> 10:14.481
- Thank you. Welcome.
- Great. I don't know--

10:14.547 --> 10:15.983
- Thank you.
- Hello.

10:16.049 --> 10:19.086
- Hello. Nice--hello.
- Morning.

10:19.152 --> 10:20.287
- Hello, ma'am.
- Welcome to Clues Booze

10:20.353 --> 10:22.589
Cruise--Q's Bees Cru--
Q's Booze Cruise.

10:22.656 --> 10:25.158
- You know,
I'm here as an individual.

10:25.225 --> 10:27.260
I'm not part of his, uh, part...

10:27.327 --> 10:29.797
- It doesn't matter.
- Just a solo person.

10:29.863 --> 10:30.898
Everybody's giving me
backstory today.

10:30.964 --> 10:32.132
- I'm single.
- Uh-huh.

10:32.199 --> 10:34.735
[light music]

10:34.802 --> 10:36.704
- [laughs]

10:36.770 --> 10:39.072
Mahalo.

10:39.139 --> 10:41.675
"My hollow" stomach's
gonna be filled with buffet!

10:41.742 --> 10:43.310
[laughter]

10:43.376 --> 10:45.512
- I don't get that.
I don't get that at all.

10:45.578 --> 10:48.248
- Oh, my God, I'm gonna play--
I'm playing so much of that.

10:48.315 --> 10:49.482
- You can't.
It says you're not allowed.

10:49.549 --> 10:51.284
- Oh, it's closed.
Oh, look at that.

10:51.351 --> 10:52.886
Anybody got a 5
to give the lady--

10:52.953 --> 10:54.487
Cute lady bellhops,
We give them a 5?

10:54.554 --> 10:56.123
- I didn't bring any money.
- Hi, how are you? Hi.

10:56.189 --> 10:57.324
- Stop.
- Oh! Oh, my God.

10:57.390 --> 10:59.827
- Before you come on the boat...
- Uh-huh.

10:59.893 --> 11:01.194
- We have to do health.
- Yeah.

11:01.261 --> 11:02.696
- We have to do waiver, okay?
- Uh-huh.

11:02.763 --> 11:04.197
Don't read. Just sign.

11:04.264 --> 11:05.699
- Do not read.
- Initial. Initial. Sign.

11:05.766 --> 11:08.501
- You have to sign a waiver
to eat at the buffet?

11:08.568 --> 11:10.470
- Please be quiet.
I'm doing demonstration, okay?

11:10.537 --> 11:11.638
- Please be quiet, guys.

11:11.705 --> 11:13.140
- Ah. Ah. Ah.

11:13.206 --> 11:16.944
- [screaming]

11:17.010 --> 11:18.445
- We take temperature bottom.
- Okay.

11:18.511 --> 11:20.380
- Oh, right there?
- From the back. Now bend over.

11:20.447 --> 11:22.149
He's okay. He's okay.
- Is it okay? Oh, great.

11:22.215 --> 11:24.417
See? Guys, this is so stupid,
it's easy.

11:24.484 --> 11:27.254
- I have to check
your genital, okay?

11:27.320 --> 11:29.189
- Yeah, yeah, of course.
You just got to check that?

11:29.256 --> 11:31.624
- No, open more, okay?
I'm looking.

11:31.691 --> 11:34.161
- Right after this, we get to go
on the stuff and everything?

11:34.227 --> 11:35.763
Right up--
- No. Shh!

11:35.829 --> 11:37.330
Next!
- Okay, I'm done.

11:37.397 --> 11:39.632
- Maybe--excuse me,
if I could make a suggestion.

11:39.699 --> 11:42.836
If the rest of the guys could
just all get your penises out,

11:42.903 --> 11:45.038
then they're ready for her,
so then we can move it along...

11:45.105 --> 11:46.539
- That's a great idea.
[applause]

11:46.606 --> 11:49.476
- I don't want to take
my penis out.

11:49.542 --> 11:51.711
- Hello, everyone!

11:51.779 --> 11:54.114
- Oh, hello!
[applause]

11:54.181 --> 11:55.916
- When I say, "hell,"
you say, "lo."

11:55.983 --> 11:57.350
- Hell.
all: Lo!

11:57.417 --> 11:58.651
- Hey!

11:58.718 --> 12:00.587
- I am Captain Bonsoifisse.

12:00.653 --> 12:03.456
And, yes, I am that
Captain Bonsoifisse.

12:03.523 --> 12:05.492
- Oh!
- Hello. Before you wonder,

12:05.558 --> 12:07.427
I have been acquitted.
All good.

12:07.494 --> 12:09.930
Everything is good now.
- Great.

12:09.997 --> 12:12.365
- Hola. Bienvenidos.

12:12.432 --> 12:15.936
Hello. Primero Officer Memes
deporting for duty.

12:16.003 --> 12:17.370
[laughter]
- That is a joke,

12:17.437 --> 12:19.439
but by the way,
he actually has been deported.

12:19.506 --> 12:21.108
- But we cannot talk about it,
okay?

12:21.174 --> 12:23.844
But welcome. I am so happy
for you to be here.

12:23.911 --> 12:27.747
I'm a fun guy, but, uh,
we do have some bad news.

12:27.815 --> 12:29.082
all: Oh.
- Unfortunately.

12:29.149 --> 12:31.584
We are dangerously low on beer.

12:31.651 --> 12:32.920
- Oh.
- What?

12:32.986 --> 12:35.022
- We currently have two types
of beer left.

12:35.088 --> 12:38.125
- Okay.
- It is clam-nado hot beer.

12:38.191 --> 12:39.626
- Ooh.
- Okay? It is very hot.

12:39.692 --> 12:43.897
And we also have
a clam lite lime beer.

12:43.964 --> 12:45.532
- What if you're allergic
to clams?

12:45.598 --> 12:47.167
- Good question!
Let's move on!

12:47.234 --> 12:49.937
- Oh, fun. Fun.
This is gonna be great.

12:50.003 --> 12:51.571
- I have something very serious
to talk about now.

12:51.638 --> 12:53.606
- Great.
- A lot of people say

12:53.673 --> 12:56.709
the silent killer at sea
is diarrhea.

12:56.776 --> 12:58.045
- Mm.
- Not true.

12:58.111 --> 13:01.815
Diarrhea at sea can be loud.
- Very loud.

13:01.882 --> 13:04.617
- Now, in the next three hours,

13:04.684 --> 13:07.855
I am going to teach you
how to keep your diarrhea

13:07.921 --> 13:11.558
down by the minutes using our
handy-dandy diarrhea app.

13:11.624 --> 13:13.226
- Oh, okay, cool.
- With any luck,

13:13.293 --> 13:15.495
we will be able
to keep your diarrhea

13:15.562 --> 13:18.031
down to the first
five faces.

13:18.098 --> 13:19.532
- Okay.
- Is there anything

13:19.599 --> 13:23.971
we can specifically avoid
to keep from getting

13:24.037 --> 13:25.638
in the bottom three?
- Yeah.

13:25.705 --> 13:27.574
- I have never seen a cruise
without diarrhea.

13:27.640 --> 13:29.476
- You're gonna get it.
- I don't want to get diarrhea.

13:29.542 --> 13:31.411
- I didn't want to be born
with one leg

13:31.478 --> 13:33.446
slightly shorter than the other,
but I was, and I lived with it,

13:33.513 --> 13:35.315
and look at me now!
Bon!

13:35.382 --> 13:37.384
- Listen, I didn't want to live
with my handsy uncle

13:37.450 --> 13:39.019
when I was nine years old
either,

13:39.086 --> 13:41.688
but I did it
and we got through it.

13:41.754 --> 13:43.957
- Unbelievably depressing.
- [whistle blows]

13:44.024 --> 13:45.125
- Okay, time to go to your room.

13:45.192 --> 13:48.661
[excited chatter]

13:48.728 --> 13:50.263
- Sorry. Excuse me.

13:50.330 --> 13:52.832
Hey, Mr. Memes.
Mr. Memes, hey.

13:52.900 --> 13:54.801
I just wanted to ask you,
what are you guys--

13:54.868 --> 13:56.736
how are you guys set
for entertainment on the boat?

13:56.803 --> 13:59.006
- Uh, you know,
we have the karaoke machine.

13:59.072 --> 14:00.473
It's out of order,
but, you know...

14:00.540 --> 14:02.175
- I would love to get
a couple minutes

14:02.242 --> 14:04.044
just to pitch you something...

14:04.111 --> 14:05.445
- Okay.
- That I think

14:05.512 --> 14:07.915
could change your life

14:07.981 --> 14:09.950
and save you a small fortune

14:10.017 --> 14:11.351
with your entertainment dollar.

14:11.418 --> 14:12.652
- Oh.
- It goes a very long way.

14:12.719 --> 14:13.921
- We like to save money
around here.

14:13.987 --> 14:15.222
- I can tell.

14:15.288 --> 14:18.158
[smooth guitar music]

14:18.225 --> 14:20.193
* *

14:20.260 --> 14:23.463
[klaxon blaring]

14:27.000 --> 14:28.701
[hull creaking]

14:28.768 --> 14:31.438
So--
[electricity pops and crackles]

14:33.573 --> 14:36.276
This--

14:36.343 --> 14:38.011
I kind of like it, actually,
down here.

14:38.078 --> 14:40.013
This is executive
double platinum?

14:40.080 --> 14:41.514
- Yes.
- Yeah.

14:41.581 --> 14:43.116
What's below executive
double platinum?

14:43.183 --> 14:44.284
- Nothing.
- Nothing.

14:44.351 --> 14:45.685
- You are lowest.
- Right.

14:45.752 --> 14:46.987
This is rustic.

14:47.054 --> 14:48.621
[laughs]
Almost to a fault.

14:48.688 --> 14:50.257
- It's nicer than that place
we had in Loughlin.

14:50.323 --> 14:52.459
- By a lot.
And, uh, yes.

14:52.525 --> 14:53.893
- You know the best part?
- Yeah.

14:53.961 --> 14:55.395
- No windows.
- Mm.

14:55.462 --> 14:56.930
- I have a hard time
getting to sleep sometimes,

14:56.997 --> 14:59.332
but I feel like there's
so little oxygen in here

14:59.399 --> 15:01.001
that it's gonna be pretty easy
to doze off.

15:01.068 --> 15:02.802
- You want to work.
You want to work a little bit

15:02.869 --> 15:04.171
when you sleep, you know?

15:04.237 --> 15:05.838
- Earn your life.
- Earn your life.

15:05.905 --> 15:08.208
- Earn your life.
- Earn the trip, you know?

15:08.275 --> 15:09.909
- Is that a bat?
Those aren't bats up there?

15:09.977 --> 15:11.311
- Oh, yes.
- Those are bats?

15:11.378 --> 15:13.680
- Yes, they come with the room
complimentary.

15:13.746 --> 15:15.448
- Oh, they're moving.
Look, they're moving.

15:15.515 --> 15:16.984
They're wiggling around.
- That's beautiful.

15:17.050 --> 15:19.152
- Aw, there's the baby.
- Oh, that's a baby!

15:19.219 --> 15:22.222
- Aw!
- They're a family.

15:22.289 --> 15:24.257
Sorry. Excuse me.

15:24.324 --> 15:26.126
Excuse me. Pardon me.

15:26.193 --> 15:27.760
Johnny Tremain has landed.

15:27.827 --> 15:29.496
- Hi.
- Hi!

15:29.562 --> 15:31.231
- I'm gonna need you
to check your guns.

15:31.298 --> 15:33.266
- I'm good, actually.
- Oh...

15:33.333 --> 15:34.801
- No, last Q conference
in Dallas,

15:34.867 --> 15:36.036
there was open carry.

15:36.103 --> 15:37.370
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah, 42 people

15:37.437 --> 15:39.239
had catastrophic injuries
at bingo night.

15:39.306 --> 15:41.274
- Oh, well, that makes sense.
- Yeah.

15:41.341 --> 15:42.675
- He has a code he lives by.

15:42.742 --> 15:44.144
Will you just pry it
from his hand?

15:44.211 --> 15:45.912
- Just pry it.
- Okay!

15:45.979 --> 15:47.614
- If you don't pry it,
he can't give it.

15:47.680 --> 15:50.783
- Once you're off the boat,
Second Amendment.

15:50.850 --> 15:52.319
- You're the--
You're the pink hat--

15:52.385 --> 15:53.653
That's you!
- Yeah, that's me.

15:53.720 --> 15:55.888
- You're the lady
from the peaceful protest.

15:55.955 --> 15:57.624
- Yeah.
- Remind me?

15:57.690 --> 15:59.592
- Yeah, she pooped
in Nancy Pelosi's desk

15:59.659 --> 16:01.094
at the big peaceful protest.
- You did not!

16:01.161 --> 16:02.262
- Yeah.
- You're that lady?

16:02.329 --> 16:03.230
- Yeah. Remember?
- Look at that.

16:03.296 --> 16:05.198
- Oh, my gosh! Whoa!

16:05.265 --> 16:06.833
- You know Charlie Kirk.

16:06.899 --> 16:08.068
- Color me starstruck.

16:08.135 --> 16:09.736
- Wow.
- Holy cow.

16:09.802 --> 16:11.471
- Would you like to buy
a copy of my book?

16:11.538 --> 16:13.540
- You wrote a long book.
- Yes, please. How much is it?

16:13.606 --> 16:17.510
Well, they're $9.99,
but $49.99 if I autograph it.

16:17.577 --> 16:19.512
- Oh.
- Oh, wow.

16:19.579 --> 16:21.081
- We'll just look at it.

16:21.148 --> 16:22.482
- We're gonna look at it and
remember it was really great.

16:22.549 --> 16:23.483
- Well, think about it.
- Thank you very much.

16:23.550 --> 16:24.684
This was great.

16:24.751 --> 16:25.652
I'm sure there's tons
of big stars

16:25.718 --> 16:26.886
that we're gonna meet, so...

16:26.953 --> 16:28.421
- I mean, I heard--

16:28.488 --> 16:29.922
I heard Q was here.

16:29.989 --> 16:31.391
- So where's his book table?

16:31.458 --> 16:33.360
Or her book--
their book table?

16:33.426 --> 16:34.827
- The Q.
- Do--do we--

16:34.894 --> 16:36.329
do you recognize him?

16:36.396 --> 16:38.298
Here?

16:38.365 --> 16:40.167
- Okay, I don't know who he is.
- Mm-hmm.

16:40.233 --> 16:42.435
- But I-I know he's handsome.

16:42.502 --> 16:44.437
I know he's white,
but that's all I know.

16:44.504 --> 16:47.006
- Well, we all assume.
- Oh, my God.

16:47.074 --> 16:48.441
- What?

16:48.508 --> 16:49.409
- Are those the Black Lives
Don't Matter people

16:49.476 --> 16:50.810
with the little tiny guns?

16:50.877 --> 16:52.479
- I want a picture!
I got to get a picture!

16:52.545 --> 16:54.414
- Got to go. Got to go.
- Have a good conference.

16:54.481 --> 16:55.848
- It was nice meeting you!
- Thank you.

16:55.915 --> 16:58.551
Oh. Oh, thank you.

17:02.422 --> 17:03.856
- Hey.

17:03.923 --> 17:07.860
[whispers]
Fan out. Reconnaissance.

17:07.927 --> 17:10.930
Don't do anything to draw
extra attention to us, okay?

17:10.997 --> 17:13.066
- No.

17:13.133 --> 17:15.268
- Fan out. Recon mode.

17:15.335 --> 17:16.869
Can you hear me?

17:16.936 --> 17:18.238
Tremain to Chet.

17:18.305 --> 17:20.039
Trudy.
- Yes?

17:20.107 --> 17:22.775
- What's with the dress?

17:22.842 --> 17:25.011
- It's part of our backstory.
- Oh, good.

17:25.078 --> 17:27.180
- You and I...

17:27.247 --> 17:28.681
we're a couple.
- Yeah.

17:28.748 --> 17:30.650
- You...

17:30.717 --> 17:32.752
are a 79-year-old Presbyterian

17:32.819 --> 17:34.987
who owns an auto parts
dealership in Fresno

17:35.054 --> 17:37.257
that you bought with your dead
grandma's money.

17:37.324 --> 17:43.330
I am a 29-year-old trophy wife
who has a keen eye for fashion

17:43.396 --> 17:47.200
and a masters degree
in birds and things.

17:47.267 --> 17:49.436
I...

17:49.502 --> 17:50.803
have one flaw,

17:50.870 --> 17:52.739
and it's that sometimes
I'm a little too nice.

17:52.805 --> 17:56.042
Our neighbor Rodrigo
has three dogs.

17:56.109 --> 17:57.310
One of them is missing.

17:57.377 --> 17:58.645
We think the nephew took him.

17:58.711 --> 18:00.547
I think he may have
eaten him.

18:00.613 --> 18:03.049
If you panic,
squeeze my hand 11 times

18:03.116 --> 18:05.218
and we will start making out,
got it?

18:05.285 --> 18:06.453
- Okay.

18:06.519 --> 18:07.787
Trudy?
- Hmm?

18:07.854 --> 18:11.491
You still didn't
explain the dress.

18:11.558 --> 18:13.693
- Oh, I never got
to that part in the story.

18:13.760 --> 18:15.027
I think I'm wearing
the wrong outfit.

18:15.094 --> 18:16.296
- It's okay.

18:16.363 --> 18:19.399
- Hello, um, strange...

18:19.466 --> 18:20.633
people.

18:20.700 --> 18:23.803
- And the deep state's really,
really...

18:23.870 --> 18:26.673
doing--but--getting us hard.
- This is my husband.

18:26.739 --> 18:28.074
Our neighbor's name
is Rodrigo.

18:28.141 --> 18:29.642
- Don't do the whole thing.
- He has three dogs,

18:29.709 --> 18:31.043
but one of them is missing.

18:31.110 --> 18:32.145
- That's Raineesha.
It's Raineesha.

18:32.212 --> 18:33.280
- It's a horrible story.

18:33.346 --> 18:34.714
- You recognize Raineesha,
right?

18:34.781 --> 18:36.649
- I didn't at first,
I got to be honest.

18:36.716 --> 18:38.818
- I didn't think you did.
- Those are very distracting.

18:38.885 --> 18:41.321
You should put them away.
- Nice meeting you, Coco.

18:41.388 --> 18:43.122
- So nice to meet y'all too.

18:43.190 --> 18:45.592
A beautiful QAnon couple.

18:45.658 --> 18:47.294
- You should see him
with his pants off.

18:47.360 --> 18:51.164
[all laugh]

18:51.231 --> 18:53.766
- Hollywood's full of vampires.
Nothing but vampires.

18:53.833 --> 18:55.835
[laughing]

18:55.902 --> 18:58.037
- So nice to meet you,
Julian.

18:58.104 --> 19:00.173
And thank you again
for getting me this free drink.

19:00.240 --> 19:01.408
- Yeah, if I could have
bought it, I would.

19:01.474 --> 19:03.142
[both laugh]

19:03.210 --> 19:04.877
I couldn't buy it, though.
I couldn't buy it.

19:04.944 --> 19:07.780
So good to be here.
- I'm surprised.

19:07.847 --> 19:09.249
You know, 'cause I ain't think
they was gonna have

19:09.316 --> 19:10.750
too many Blacks around here.

19:10.817 --> 19:12.519
- Yeah, it's a lot
of white folk, ain't it?

19:12.585 --> 19:13.920
Let me tell you
a little bit about myself.

19:13.986 --> 19:15.822
- I'm listening.
- I'm an entrepreneur.

19:15.888 --> 19:17.990
- Mm!
- I own a couple of businesses.

19:18.057 --> 19:19.792
- Well?
- Yeah. I do real estate.

19:19.859 --> 19:21.761
So, yeah...
- Married?

19:21.828 --> 19:23.563
- No, I am not married.
- Wait a minute.

19:23.630 --> 19:26.199
I'm gonna step a little closer.
- Okay, come on.

19:26.266 --> 19:28.201
I'm single.
[laughter]

19:28.268 --> 19:29.436
Look at you!

19:29.502 --> 19:31.704
Oh, you got me blushing
up in here.

19:31.771 --> 19:34.574
Golly. I also like to, um,
collect my poop,

19:34.641 --> 19:38.044
so the government
does not clone me.

19:42.315 --> 19:43.583
- M'kay.

19:43.650 --> 19:45.852
- So you guys know
who, uh, Q is?

19:45.918 --> 19:47.787
Q?
- What do you mean?

19:47.854 --> 19:51.258
- That's a weird question.
Let me ask you something.

19:51.324 --> 19:52.592
You guys cops?

19:52.659 --> 19:54.093
- That's what I'm wondering.

19:54.160 --> 19:55.895
That's like
a cop-like question.

19:55.962 --> 19:58.965
- Yeah.
- "Do you know who Q is?"

19:59.031 --> 20:00.767
- You know about
aliens and stuff.

20:00.833 --> 20:03.403
Let's not get into
the grays, all right?

20:03.470 --> 20:04.804
Aliens are real.

20:04.871 --> 20:06.439
You got to be careful
of them too,

20:06.506 --> 20:08.174
'cause they will abduct you.

20:08.241 --> 20:09.676
It's happened.

20:09.742 --> 20:12.078
And let's not talk
about the probing.

20:12.144 --> 20:14.881
Did--did they get
whatever was in you?

20:14.947 --> 20:16.048
I hope so.

20:17.149 --> 20:19.419
I hope so.

20:19.486 --> 20:20.820
[applause]
- Thank you. Thank you.

20:20.887 --> 20:23.890
Uh, welcome, searchers,
pioneers, and patriots.

20:23.956 --> 20:26.493
I-I hate to start off
with bad news,

20:26.559 --> 20:30.363
but Sidney Powell will not
be giving our keynote address.

20:30.430 --> 20:31.498
She is under house arrest
right now.

20:31.564 --> 20:33.433
Uh, I apologize.

20:33.500 --> 20:35.502
And, again, ever hopeful,
ever forward.

20:35.568 --> 20:38.671
That is what we believe here.

20:38.738 --> 20:40.407
Yes, thank you.
[cheers and applause]

20:40.473 --> 20:43.676
So, um, you know,
Q is a question,

20:43.743 --> 20:45.712
a query, and a quest.

20:45.778 --> 20:48.448
And pretty soon,
it is going to be a quality,

20:48.515 --> 20:52.552
much like the quality time
that many of us are being denied

20:52.619 --> 20:54.321
spending with our kids

20:54.387 --> 20:56.389
because of divorce court judges,

20:56.456 --> 20:58.325
resentful ex-wives,

20:58.391 --> 21:00.026
traitorous family members

21:00.092 --> 21:02.261
who screenshot
our Instagram posts

21:02.329 --> 21:06.333
to show family counselors who
are deciding visitation rights,

21:06.399 --> 21:08.801
who are believing the lies
of the deep state.

21:08.868 --> 21:10.770
Those masks will be lifted.

21:10.837 --> 21:12.672
We are about to experience

21:12.739 --> 21:16.175
much the same experience

21:16.242 --> 21:18.210
that Rowdy Roddy Piper
experienced

21:18.277 --> 21:20.680
in the movie "They Live,"

21:20.747 --> 21:21.948
when the...
[applause]

21:22.014 --> 21:24.183
- Yeah!
- When the big, uh,

21:24.250 --> 21:26.686
deep state illusion beam
was finally destroyed.

21:26.753 --> 21:28.721
That will soon happen for us.

21:28.788 --> 21:30.957
That is what Q is doing.

21:31.023 --> 21:33.393
And the masks will be lifted.

21:33.460 --> 21:35.328
All of that will be lifted.

21:35.395 --> 21:37.764
[applause]

21:37.830 --> 21:40.567
Q has cracked the code,

21:40.633 --> 21:42.034
and once you crack the code,

21:42.101 --> 21:45.872
it is so easy to see
what is hidden out there.

21:45.938 --> 21:49.776
What is keeping you from--
from real strength.

21:49.842 --> 21:52.645
From real reality.

21:52.712 --> 21:54.947
From real love.

21:55.014 --> 21:58.284
That kind of code-cracking

21:58.351 --> 22:01.153
is what we are here

22:01.220 --> 22:03.790
on this ship doing.

22:03.856 --> 22:05.925
You're the only ones
who can see it.

22:05.992 --> 22:10.129
And thank you guys so much
for being on this cruise.

22:10.196 --> 22:11.864
Full truth ahead.

22:11.931 --> 22:14.734
And, um, everyone
enjoy the cruise.

22:14.801 --> 22:20.407
Thank you, thank you.
[applause]

22:20.473 --> 22:21.774
- Heil Hitler!

22:21.841 --> 22:23.443
- No, Trudy, no.
Trudy, no, no, no, no.

22:23.510 --> 22:24.877
I mean, kind of.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

22:24.944 --> 22:26.979
She's right, yeah, yeah.
- Right?

22:27.046 --> 22:30.383
- I mean, heil all kinds of--
- Heil everybody.

22:31.784 --> 22:33.219
[PA system chimes]

22:33.285 --> 22:35.121

before you use

any restrooms on the second,
third,

fourth, and sixth floor.

22:39.559 --> 22:40.827
- Morning, gang.

22:40.893 --> 22:41.994
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

22:42.061 --> 22:42.995
- Morning.

22:45.231 --> 22:46.433
- [sighs]

22:46.499 --> 22:47.700
Oh, God. Ooh.

22:47.767 --> 22:49.368
- Hot, right?

22:49.436 --> 22:51.804
- It feels like almost
dangerously so.

22:51.871 --> 22:53.640
- Yeah.
- Yeah, creeps up on you.

22:53.706 --> 22:55.374
- Johnny Tremain
has a thought over here.

22:55.442 --> 22:57.810
The little bird, the, uh...

22:57.877 --> 22:59.579
the speaker.

22:59.646 --> 23:00.880
Little weirdy
with the short arms.

23:00.947 --> 23:03.483
- Oh.
- Eyeballs all over you.

23:03.550 --> 23:05.685
- Mm-hmm.
- Saw that.

23:05.752 --> 23:07.219
- I thought he was looking
at me.

23:07.286 --> 23:09.388
- Mm-mm.
- No, I think he's got a...

23:09.456 --> 23:11.190
- He got a motor...
- He got a Marty Feldman?

23:11.257 --> 23:12.391
- Yeah. Well...

23:12.459 --> 23:13.693
- I thought he was
looking at my vag.

23:13.760 --> 23:14.861
- He got a little bit.
- Nope.

23:14.927 --> 23:16.863
- Here's what I'm thinking.

23:16.929 --> 23:18.798
That horrible little
weird little midget man.

23:18.865 --> 23:20.800
- Yeah.
- He feels like he's got

23:20.867 --> 23:24.671
an itch he needs to scratch.

23:24.737 --> 23:26.606
- Is this code too?
- Yes.

23:26.673 --> 23:28.908
- Clemmie, code name: Roxy.
- Yeah.

23:28.975 --> 23:30.810
- Could get next
to that little weirdo.

23:30.877 --> 23:32.111
- Know what I mean?
- Easy.

23:32.178 --> 23:34.280
- Honey trap.
- Seduction.

23:34.346 --> 23:36.215
- I did it to become
Miss Teen Whiskey Pete's,

23:36.282 --> 23:37.550
and I can do it now.

23:37.617 --> 23:38.818
- I believe the after-party

23:38.885 --> 23:41.220
is on the lido deck at 7:00.

23:41.287 --> 23:44.156
Perhaps there
we should lay our trap.

23:44.223 --> 23:46.392
- I have never felt
such a sense of purpose.

23:46.459 --> 23:47.994
It's been a long time.

23:48.060 --> 23:49.395
- On behalf of the Reno
Sheriff's Department,

23:49.462 --> 23:52.499
I authorize you to go to third,
but not home.

23:52.565 --> 23:53.800
- This might be kind of obvious,

23:53.866 --> 23:57.670
but home is--
home run is vag.

23:57.737 --> 23:59.405
What would butt stuff be?

23:59.472 --> 24:01.340
- Grand slam.

24:01.407 --> 24:02.475
Finishing in the butt?

24:02.542 --> 24:04.176
- That's a walk-off.
- Wait a minute.

24:04.243 --> 24:06.646
But what if you finish with
your peen between the teets?

24:06.713 --> 24:08.981
What is that called?
- Sometimes it's just an error.

a coup in Venezuela?

Is it Obama?
Hillary Clinton?

George Soros?
All of the above?

24:35.575 --> 24:37.844
a robot sent to the future
by Adolf Hitler...

24:37.910 --> 24:40.079
- Ooh! Oh, I'm sorry.

24:40.146 --> 24:42.081
[both laugh]
- [imitates robot beeping]

24:42.148 --> 24:44.817
- I'm so clumsy.
- So close here. Um...

24:46.318 --> 24:48.755
- I really liked what you were
doing onstage today.

24:48.821 --> 24:50.422
- I noticed.

24:50.489 --> 24:53.392
- Um...

24:53.459 --> 24:55.027
You...

24:55.094 --> 24:57.564
You know a lot about this--
this Q.

24:57.630 --> 24:59.331
This mysterious Q.

24:59.398 --> 25:01.100
- I mean...

25:01.167 --> 25:03.536
do you have a couple hours?
Because--

25:03.603 --> 25:06.505
- I do.
- Oh. Well, um...

25:06.573 --> 25:11.978
Q is something I would like
to talk about with you.

25:12.044 --> 25:14.881
That was a Q symbol
I just did on your shoulder.

25:14.947 --> 25:17.917
- Listen, I, am...

25:17.984 --> 25:20.720
waxed, chillaxed,
and unvaxxed.

25:20.787 --> 25:23.222
So...

25:51.684 --> 25:54.887
Now, sit back and enjoy

25:54.954 --> 25:58.024
187 minutes

25:58.090 --> 26:01.027
of world-class puppetry.

26:01.093 --> 26:03.830
Oh, fuck.
Oh, got it.

gonna make amends *

26:15.241 --> 26:19.278

[in high-pitched voice]
Hi, Mom!

26:26.653 --> 26:28.087
Here we go!

26:28.154 --> 26:32.859
Better get ready
to start the show.

26:34.093 --> 26:36.495
- [chuckling]

26:36.562 --> 26:38.130
Oh...
- Hey.

26:38.197 --> 26:39.565
- Good to see you.
- [laughs]

26:39.632 --> 26:41.267
- Beautiful night, huh?

26:41.333 --> 26:42.401
- Yeah.

26:42.468 --> 26:43.836
I guess you could
call it that.

26:43.903 --> 26:45.738
- You know,
there used to be a saying

26:45.805 --> 26:47.073
when I was in school.

26:47.139 --> 26:49.742
Why think when you can drink?

26:49.809 --> 26:51.243
My private stash.
Go ahead.

26:51.310 --> 26:53.079
- I like that saying.
- Mai tai.

26:53.145 --> 26:55.514
- Yeah. Now it's...

26:55.581 --> 26:56.716
both: Our tai.

26:56.783 --> 26:58.050
[both laugh]

26:58.117 --> 27:00.052
- Cheers.
- Oh!

27:00.119 --> 27:03.790
Have you ever played
"I Ain't Never"?

27:03.856 --> 27:05.191
- "I Ain't Never."
I don't--

27:05.257 --> 27:08.160
- It's the Black version of
"Never Have I Ever."

27:08.227 --> 27:09.896
- Well, you know,
that game is probably

27:09.962 --> 27:12.131
a lot more fun with women.

27:12.198 --> 27:13.700
- I'll start.
- Okay.

27:13.766 --> 27:16.468
- I ain't never...

27:16.535 --> 27:20.973
run a ship aground
in Puerto Rico,

27:21.040 --> 27:24.476
thinking that I saw someone
that I knew.

27:24.543 --> 27:27.146
Yeah? Mm. Mm.

27:27.213 --> 27:29.415
- That's so specific to you.
- Ah!

27:29.481 --> 27:32.184
I need you to do me a favor.
- Hmm?

27:32.251 --> 27:34.320
- Take these keys.
I am...

27:34.386 --> 27:39.625
way too messed up to drive.

27:39.692 --> 27:41.193
- I'm gonna walk away now.

27:41.260 --> 27:42.695
- I'm going to watch you.

27:42.762 --> 27:44.463
Bon!

27:45.798 --> 27:48.100
- Voyage.

27:48.167 --> 27:49.635
What the fuck?

27:53.272 --> 27:55.174
- How was everybody's
intermission?

27:57.509 --> 27:59.578
Act trois.

27:59.645 --> 28:01.814
In which we travel...

28:01.881 --> 28:05.017
south of the border.

28:06.685 --> 28:08.287
Fuck it. I'm sorry.

28:08.354 --> 28:10.056
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.

28:10.122 --> 28:11.991
Fuck it. Oh, fuck.

28:14.326 --> 28:16.528
Hernan is about to learn

28:16.595 --> 28:21.667
a little lesson
about amigo-ship.

28:21.734 --> 28:23.202
And when you're on a ship,

28:23.269 --> 28:25.171
friend--friendship is the--

28:25.237 --> 28:27.006
Ah, fuck it. Sorry.

28:28.240 --> 28:29.708
Hernan's gonna learn a lesson,

28:29.776 --> 28:32.745
that when we're helping
other people...

28:32.812 --> 28:36.215
[breathing heavily]

28:36.282 --> 28:38.717
Hernan--fuck it, fuck it.
Fuck it!

28:38.785 --> 28:40.119
We're gonna skip ahead.

28:40.186 --> 28:41.954
Skip ahead, skip ahead.
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

28:42.021 --> 28:43.389
[boat horn blares]

28:43.455 --> 28:45.124
[cell phone chimes]
- Oh!

28:45.191 --> 28:48.727
Time to take my medication.

28:49.829 --> 28:51.130
Oh, shit.

28:51.197 --> 28:54.300
Meh, should be fine.

29:01.874 --> 29:03.575
- [inhales and sighs]

29:05.912 --> 29:07.613
Look at you.

29:07.679 --> 29:11.183
Did you steal that gown
from a princess?

29:12.518 --> 29:14.153
- Well, it's a Frozen
Halloween costume

29:14.220 --> 29:16.588
that I bought at Rite Aid,
so, yeah, kind of.

29:16.655 --> 29:19.926
- [laughs]

29:19.992 --> 29:23.295
I'm Xavier Rothchild III.

29:23.362 --> 29:26.398
I quit a successful career
in the cinema

29:26.465 --> 29:28.935
to become a doctor for cats.

29:29.001 --> 29:31.337
And now,
I go wherever I'm needed,

29:31.403 --> 29:35.674
which is anywhere a cat
needs a doctor.

29:35.741 --> 29:37.309
- Isn't that a...

29:37.376 --> 29:40.779
a veterinarian,
technically?

29:40.847 --> 29:42.414
- I don't think so.

29:42.481 --> 29:44.851
- Okay.

29:44.917 --> 29:46.018
Well, my name is Trudy.

29:46.085 --> 29:47.887
I am an undercover cop,

29:47.954 --> 29:49.055
which I'm not
supposed to say,

29:49.121 --> 29:50.622
but I kind of feel like

29:50.689 --> 29:52.624
you and I are getting along
really well,

29:52.691 --> 29:57.196
and I can probably tell you
all my secrets, so...

29:57.263 --> 29:58.898
- You can tell me anything.

29:58.965 --> 30:00.132
- [titters]

30:00.199 --> 30:02.168
- Trudy?
- Yeah?

30:02.234 --> 30:04.303
- Would you like to join me
for a cocktail

30:04.370 --> 30:07.739
and a walk around the ship?

30:07.806 --> 30:10.676
- Well, I'm supposed to join
my friends on the lower deck

30:10.742 --> 30:12.078
for a diarrhea test,

30:12.144 --> 30:15.347
but I suppose I could.

30:19.251 --> 30:20.719
- Oh, these are not for us.

30:20.786 --> 30:22.554
Uh, I put out
a cigarette in this.

30:22.621 --> 30:24.390
Sorry, let me get us
some fresh drinks.

30:24.456 --> 30:26.358
- I'm not thirsty.
I'm not thirsty.

30:26.425 --> 30:27.960
- It's okay,
come with me.

30:28.027 --> 30:29.128
- Okay.
- Come with me.

30:29.195 --> 30:30.997
- No, Caesar,

30:31.063 --> 30:33.699
I will not renounce
the Christ.

30:33.765 --> 30:37.169
[deeps voice]
This Christ seems to have

30:37.236 --> 30:42.875
a power over mens' souls.

30:42.942 --> 30:45.945
My name is James Ron Dangle.
That is the show.

30:46.012 --> 30:47.646
I'm 66 years young.

30:47.713 --> 30:49.381
I'm between apartments
right now.

30:49.448 --> 30:51.884
I would love--
in fact, need--

30:51.951 --> 30:53.719
to do this for you.

30:53.785 --> 30:55.988
But it's not just me
you have to thank

30:56.055 --> 30:57.623
for tonight's entertainment.

30:57.689 --> 30:59.992
Let's meet all

31:00.059 --> 31:02.294
of the 88 performers

31:02.361 --> 31:05.731
who just brought you
this wonderful tale.

31:07.399 --> 31:10.569
- Who eats baby hearts
to stay young-looking?

31:10.636 --> 31:13.305
Kate Beckinsale?
Gwyneth Paltrow?

31:13.372 --> 31:15.241
Ryan Seacrest?

31:15.307 --> 31:16.909
- I'm in, um...

31:16.976 --> 31:19.278
I'm in Cabin 1503.

31:19.345 --> 31:20.947
- Okay.
- 1-5-0-3.

31:21.013 --> 31:22.214
- 1503.

31:22.281 --> 31:23.449
- Which is, um, you know,

31:23.515 --> 31:25.384
March 15th backwards,
you know.

31:25.451 --> 31:26.986
The Ides of March.

31:27.053 --> 31:29.655
It kind of makes sense
they gave me that room.

31:29.721 --> 31:31.890
- I'm gonna take your word
for that.

31:31.958 --> 31:35.327
I liked this when I understood
what you were talking about,

31:35.394 --> 31:37.263
and I feel like
where you were going

31:37.329 --> 31:40.766
was you were going to
ask me to...

31:40.832 --> 31:42.134
go bang in your room.

31:42.201 --> 31:43.702
I felt like that's where
this was headed.

31:43.769 --> 31:45.371
- Let me--really quick,
could I just, um...

31:45.437 --> 31:46.805
[clears throat]

31:48.207 --> 31:50.943
Would you come bang in my room?

31:51.010 --> 31:53.312
- Let me tell you
what I'm looking for from you.

31:53.379 --> 31:55.347
- Oh, okay.
- Okay.

31:55.414 --> 31:57.249
We're gonna bone

31:57.316 --> 31:58.617
and we're gonna talk about Q.

31:58.684 --> 32:00.719
We're gonna listen
to some smooth jazz.

32:00.786 --> 32:02.054
- Uh-huh.

32:02.121 --> 32:03.589
- And we're gonna make this

32:03.655 --> 32:06.892
the best two-day booze cruise

32:06.959 --> 32:09.661
in all of history.

32:09.728 --> 32:13.565
- Prepare to have your mind
and, uh, vagina blown apart.

32:13.632 --> 32:15.134
- Ah.

32:15.201 --> 32:18.304
[smooth jazz music]

32:18.370 --> 32:20.239
- You got this.
You got this.

32:20.306 --> 32:21.507
You give this guy
a blowner,

32:21.573 --> 32:22.908
he might accidentally
tell the truth.

32:22.975 --> 32:24.376
Happens to me.

32:24.443 --> 32:25.877
- He's not gonna get
too far in my pants.

32:25.944 --> 32:28.747
I've got an old-school Cotex
with a belt.

32:28.814 --> 32:30.416
- That's my girl.
- Impenetrable.

32:30.482 --> 32:32.084
- Well, well, well.

32:32.151 --> 32:33.819
What do we have here?
- Oh, man!

32:33.885 --> 32:35.554
Talking about the kraken.

32:35.621 --> 32:37.689
- Why are you guys living
down here in the basement?

32:37.756 --> 32:39.458
- It was a package deal.
- It was a package.

32:39.525 --> 32:42.194
It seemed like--
they make it sound way nicer.

32:42.261 --> 32:43.695
- Very affordable.

32:43.762 --> 32:45.464
- Hey, man,
how about the great awakening?

32:45.531 --> 32:46.932
- Yeah. The storm.

32:46.999 --> 32:49.668
- Epstein didn't kill himself,
right?

32:49.735 --> 32:51.070
Ha-ha!
- The storm's coming.

32:51.137 --> 32:52.904
- Come on.
- So, uh...

32:52.971 --> 32:55.441
word has it you guys...

32:55.507 --> 32:57.143
know who Q is.

32:57.209 --> 32:58.377
[clears throat]

32:58.444 --> 33:00.446
- Why would we?
- I mean...

33:00.512 --> 33:04.850
I'd give my body freely to Q,
just on principle.

33:04.916 --> 33:06.018
- Fine.

33:07.686 --> 33:09.055
FBI, guys.
- Whoa!

33:09.121 --> 33:10.556
- Oh!
- Oh, my God.

33:10.622 --> 33:12.491
- Federal Bureau
of Investigation.

33:12.558 --> 33:14.526
- God damn it.
- Oh, my God.

33:14.593 --> 33:15.961
- What a good badge.
- Okay...

33:16.028 --> 33:17.129
Reno Sheriff's Department.

33:17.196 --> 33:18.364
- You're kidding me?

33:18.430 --> 33:19.731
- My name is not
Jonny Tremain.

33:19.798 --> 33:21.033
- You're deep cover
looking for...

33:21.100 --> 33:22.268
- No way.

33:22.334 --> 33:23.869
- Oh, hey! Whoa, whoa!

33:23.935 --> 33:25.671
- Oh!
- Oh, man!

33:25.737 --> 33:28.174
So the deep state...
- Yes.

33:28.240 --> 33:30.309
- Is gonna just do...

33:30.376 --> 33:33.712
- Oh. You can cut the shit.
I'm CIA.

33:33.779 --> 33:35.147
- You're CIA?

33:35.214 --> 33:36.815
- I'm with Vice News.

33:36.882 --> 33:38.617
Is anyone QAnon
on this whole boat?

33:38.684 --> 33:40.386
- Hold on, I'm with
"Mother Jones" journal, man.

33:40.452 --> 33:41.853
You think I would be here--

33:41.920 --> 33:43.655
I wouldn't be wearing
all these flags and shit.

33:43.722 --> 33:45.624
I'm a Black man.
- I thought you were a real Q.

33:45.691 --> 33:48.094
- I thought you were real.
- Yeah, you were good!

33:48.160 --> 33:50.028
[overlapping chatter]

33:50.096 --> 33:51.730
- You look amazing.
- You look like that lady.

33:51.797 --> 33:53.299
- Thank you. I know.
I really do look like her.

33:53.365 --> 33:54.900
- Now that I see you,

33:54.966 --> 33:56.768
I've seen you on Vice News
thousands of times.

33:56.835 --> 33:57.769
- Yes.
- This is the lady

33:57.836 --> 33:59.305
from Vice News-
- Oh!

33:59.371 --> 34:00.506
You made that Nazi guy cry

34:00.572 --> 34:02.508
in the thing
with the Proud Boys.

34:02.574 --> 34:04.476
I've masturbated to you.

34:04.543 --> 34:05.877
- Since we're all

- That's great.

43:55.967 --> 43:57.568
I hate to break up
whatever this is,

43:57.635 --> 44:00.171
but, uh, Ron is not Q.

44:00.238 --> 44:03.274
He's a gym instructor
from Fresno.

44:03.341 --> 44:06.745
- I guess Arby's has, like,
a restraining order against him.

44:06.812 --> 44:08.513
- That's it.
- Sorry, guys.

44:08.579 --> 44:10.215
- Sorry.

44:13.484 --> 44:14.619
[solemn chanting]

44:14.686 --> 44:15.754
- One more time from the top?

44:15.821 --> 44:19.925
* *

44:19.991 --> 44:23.962
- The ship has officially
run out of toilet paper.

44:24.029 --> 44:26.264
Please use
your assigned towel.

44:26.331 --> 44:28.166
- I can't believe I played
stinky pinkie

44:28.233 --> 44:29.868
with someone who wasn't Q.

44:29.935 --> 44:32.237
- Oh, okay.

44:35.874 --> 44:38.176
[steel drum music playing]

44:38.243 --> 44:40.645
- I hear steel drums.

44:40.712 --> 44:44.382
I smell coconuts.

44:44.449 --> 44:46.617
- Oh! We're in Nassau.
- Whoo!

44:46.684 --> 44:48.019
- We're in Nassau!

44:48.086 --> 44:50.288
[all chatter excitedly]

44:50.355 --> 44:53.458
[upbeat calypso music]

44:53.524 --> 44:56.061
* *

44:56.127 --> 44:58.129
- Nassau! Nassau! Nassau!

44:58.196 --> 45:00.398
Nassau! Nassau!

45:00.465 --> 45:02.567
- Okay, everybody!
[blows whistle]

45:02.633 --> 45:05.837
Please, attention.
Open your orejas, please.

45:05.904 --> 45:08.506
I have some bad news.

45:08.573 --> 45:12.911
I have just been told that we
have a super strain of diarrhea.

45:12.978 --> 45:15.781
The worst diarrhea known to man.

45:15.847 --> 45:17.382
No one can dock in Nassau.

45:17.448 --> 45:19.417
We are officially quarantined
here.

45:19.484 --> 45:20.718
- What?
- No, no, no, no.

45:20.786 --> 45:22.988
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Mr. Memes.

45:23.054 --> 45:24.155
- We've been bubbled
this whole time.

45:24.222 --> 45:25.423
- You are not keeping us
on this ship!

45:25.490 --> 45:27.425
We have already had
the worst diarrhea!

45:27.492 --> 45:29.594
We're a pod. We're fine.
We're going. Good day.

45:29.660 --> 45:31.797
[overlapping shouting]

45:31.863 --> 45:35.000
[all screaming]

45:37.102 --> 45:40.571
- Nobody,
absolutely zero people,

45:40.638 --> 45:43.008
will be able
to leave this boat.

45:43.074 --> 45:44.709
- All right, you guys,

45:44.776 --> 45:46.344
enjoy your search for Q.

45:46.411 --> 45:47.846
Bye, guys.
- Thank you!

45:47.913 --> 45:49.314
- That's a sad look.

45:49.380 --> 45:51.016
- Except for these guys.
They have to leave.

45:51.082 --> 45:52.650
- Hey, Asians, Hispanic dude.

45:52.717 --> 45:54.219
- Uh-oh. Oh, oh...

45:54.285 --> 45:56.554
- As minorities...
- That's it, that's it.

45:56.621 --> 45:58.890
We need to stick together,
all right?

45:58.957 --> 46:00.191
You know what I'm saying?

46:00.258 --> 46:03.561
Like, if my back
can wash yours,

46:03.628 --> 46:06.531
then maybe you
can wash mine, right?

46:06.597 --> 46:09.968
- Yeah, man,
me and my boy here,

46:10.035 --> 46:11.436
we just like to party
up in the--

46:11.502 --> 46:12.938
- No! No!

46:13.004 --> 46:15.106
- No?
- No, no.

46:15.173 --> 46:18.944
So how many days
are we gonna be quarantined?

46:19.010 --> 46:22.713
- Just a short,
happy 30 days.

46:22.780 --> 46:23.781
- What?

46:23.849 --> 46:26.751
[overlapping shouting]

46:26.818 --> 46:29.654
[tense music]

46:29.720 --> 46:32.690
- [sobbing]

46:32.757 --> 46:39.664
* *

46:40.698 --> 46:42.868
- I got it. Let go!
- No!

46:42.934 --> 46:45.871
No! No!

46:45.937 --> 46:48.840
[panting]

46:48.907 --> 46:55.813
* *

47:01.352 --> 47:03.488
- I know you're watching me.

47:03.554 --> 47:05.323
- I know you know
I'm watching you.

47:05.390 --> 47:07.025
- I know you know
I knew it.

47:07.092 --> 47:09.160
- [counting in native language]

47:09.227 --> 47:11.329
Okay, bye-bye. Go.

47:12.597 --> 47:15.133
That's all you get.
Use front, use back.

47:15.200 --> 47:19.737
* *

47:19.804 --> 47:22.707
[dispenser whirring]

47:25.443 --> 47:26.844
- Hey, Travis...
- Huh?

47:26.912 --> 47:28.246
- Why are you doing
all those so fast?

47:28.313 --> 47:29.780
[sniffles]

47:29.847 --> 47:33.151
- Toilet paper, Boss.
- Thank you very much.

47:33.218 --> 47:34.719
- How long we been
quarantined?

47:34.785 --> 47:36.154
- Almost a half-hour.

47:36.221 --> 47:39.157
[mellow music]

47:39.224 --> 47:43.761
* *

47:46.464 --> 47:47.865
- Well, look at you.

47:50.168 --> 47:51.802
- Nice to see you again,
Clemmie,

47:51.869 --> 47:53.604
or should I say, "officer."

47:53.671 --> 47:55.974
Well, it's not nice
to see you again,

47:56.041 --> 47:57.909
you star-spangled turd.

47:57.976 --> 47:59.077
- Oh, really?

47:59.144 --> 48:02.180
The liar is offended
to see me again.

48:02.247 --> 48:06.384
- I lied, but you should
expect that from a girl.

48:06.451 --> 48:08.586
You said you were Q,

48:08.653 --> 48:11.422
and that's a lot worse,
and I am so disappointed.

48:11.489 --> 48:12.757
When a--

48:12.823 --> 48:15.060
a goddess like you
shows any bit of interest,

48:15.126 --> 48:16.894
of course I'm gonna lie.

48:16.962 --> 48:20.198
I know you didn't ask to be
this gorgeous and this perfect,

48:20.265 --> 48:21.866
but you have to be ready

48:21.933 --> 48:25.370
for guys to do stuff like this
sometimes, okay?

48:26.504 --> 48:28.239
- I am very interested

48:28.306 --> 48:30.141
in the goddess part
of what you were saying.

48:30.208 --> 48:31.509
- It doesn't matter.

48:31.576 --> 48:32.710
I should have known
that you were a mirage.

48:32.777 --> 48:34.312
I don't know if you can
understand this,

48:34.379 --> 48:37.448
but my whole life
I felt like I am stuck

48:37.515 --> 48:41.019
in this disgusting,
low-rent desert,

48:41.086 --> 48:44.222
and I'm the only one
with any real inner beauty

48:44.289 --> 48:46.057
and any actual dreams.

48:46.124 --> 48:48.493
And I just want to rise up

48:48.559 --> 48:52.363
like the burning eagle god
that I am.

48:52.430 --> 48:54.165
Can you understand that
at all?

48:54.232 --> 48:56.701
- Everything you just said

48:56.767 --> 48:59.437
is everything
that I have written

48:59.504 --> 49:02.373
in my own Akashic records.

49:02.440 --> 49:03.941
[both moaning]

49:04.009 --> 49:05.143
Oh!

49:05.210 --> 49:06.911
[giggles]

49:06.978 --> 49:09.214
[sultry music]

49:09.280 --> 49:11.782
- Oh! Ah! Ah!
- Oh, yeah!

49:11.849 --> 49:13.051
- [laughing]

49:13.118 --> 49:14.752
- [groans loudly]

49:14.819 --> 49:17.055
[sighs]

49:17.122 --> 49:19.524
That was incredible.

49:20.791 --> 49:22.493
- I'll bet it was.
- Yeah.

49:22.560 --> 49:24.962
- I admire your efficiency.

49:27.065 --> 49:30.935
- You know, only three men
have ever seen my labia before.

49:31.002 --> 49:34.639
One was my ex-husband,
one was my pediatrician,

49:34.705 --> 49:37.175
and the other
was an ambulance driver.

49:37.242 --> 49:40.478
So consider yourself
very lucky.

49:40.545 --> 49:41.846
- Proud to be number four.

49:41.912 --> 49:43.114
- [giggles]

49:43.181 --> 49:45.916
- I am tormented
by your beauty.

49:45.983 --> 49:48.219
- Mm, can I take this
out of my mouth--

49:48.286 --> 49:49.954
- Not yet.
- Okay.

49:50.021 --> 49:51.822
- Just finishing the shading

49:51.889 --> 49:56.161
around your beautiful face
and pubis.

49:56.227 --> 49:58.429
- I'm gonna need a lot of
shading,

49:58.496 --> 50:00.465
FYI, for the pubis area,

50:00.531 --> 50:02.800
because one thing they don't
tell you in health class

50:02.867 --> 50:06.971
is that your pubis does get
a lot bigger the older you get,

50:07.038 --> 50:09.074
and I'm not bragging.

50:09.140 --> 50:10.375
[laughs]

50:10.441 --> 50:11.642
- Almost done with the shading.

50:11.709 --> 50:13.144
- How does my butthole look?

50:13.211 --> 50:14.345
- Let me take a look.

50:14.412 --> 50:17.482
A little more pink.

50:17.548 --> 50:20.251
- Hmm. You flatter me.

50:20.318 --> 50:21.986
- Relax the face.

50:23.388 --> 50:26.023
And relax the anus.

50:27.458 --> 50:29.160
Yes. Perfect.

50:29.227 --> 50:32.230
- [exhales]

50:32.297 --> 50:34.499
- You know,

50:34.565 --> 50:37.468
after being inside of you
for two seconds like that,

50:37.535 --> 50:40.438
I just feel
so much closer to you.

50:40.505 --> 50:42.940
I feel like I'm a part
of you now.

50:43.007 --> 50:45.009
And I...

50:45.076 --> 50:47.545
I would never ask this,

50:47.612 --> 50:51.449
but I feel so comfortable
with you.

50:51.516 --> 50:53.584
What's your real name?

50:55.186 --> 50:56.454
- [sighs]

50:56.521 --> 50:58.423
It's kind of embarrassing.

51:00.325 --> 51:04.362
Clementine Anne Johnson.

51:04.429 --> 51:05.763
- Clementine?

51:05.830 --> 51:09.334
You mean like the sweet
nibbly cookie?

51:09.400 --> 51:13.037
I'd say that's perfect
for you.

51:13.104 --> 51:14.372
- Well, I never thought of it
like that.

51:14.439 --> 51:15.606
- [laughs]

51:15.673 --> 51:18.176
- But that makes sense.

51:18.243 --> 51:20.778
- You know...

51:20.845 --> 51:22.012
I'm not really Q.

51:22.079 --> 51:23.681
I'm his right-hand man.

51:23.748 --> 51:26.884
In a lot of ways,
I'm his mouthpiece.

51:26.951 --> 51:30.988
I deliver his messages,
and sometimes...

51:31.055 --> 51:33.491
[dramatic music]

51:33.558 --> 51:36.461
I invent some of those messages.

51:36.527 --> 51:39.063
Just the stuff like,
you know,

51:39.130 --> 51:41.499
Britney Spears
is really Lee Harvey Oswald.

51:41.566 --> 51:42.867
And, you know--
- That was you?

51:42.933 --> 51:44.902
- Yeah, that was me. Yeah.
- [gasps]

51:44.969 --> 51:47.572
- Yes, there's a bit
of a thrill of, you know,

51:47.638 --> 51:50.608
being able to kind of control
the zeitgeist,

51:50.675 --> 51:56.614
but the lifestyle
is fucking amazing.

51:56.681 --> 52:00.851
We own Jeffrey Epstein's
old island.

52:00.918 --> 52:02.920
It has a secret bunker
underneath it.

52:02.987 --> 52:07.458
It has a food court with every
discontinued fast-food chain.

52:07.525 --> 52:09.227
Kenny Rogers Roasters,
Burger Chef;

52:09.294 --> 52:12.297
they're all in operation,
only at that one food court.

52:12.363 --> 52:13.931
- Go fuck yourself.

52:13.998 --> 52:15.666
- Yeah.

52:15.733 --> 52:17.568
- You know what I find crazy,
Xavier?

52:17.635 --> 52:18.869
You're a painter.

52:18.936 --> 52:21.272
I make dolls
out of my old pantyhose,

52:21.339 --> 52:22.740
so we're both artists.

52:22.807 --> 52:26.177
And we randomly meet on a cruise
and fall in love

52:26.244 --> 52:28.145
on the exact day

52:28.213 --> 52:31.081
that I run out of
my anti-psychotic medication.

52:31.148 --> 52:33.918
I mean, if that's not kismet,
I don't know what is.

52:33.984 --> 52:35.085
- Perfect timing.

52:37.222 --> 52:39.089
- Wiegel!

52:39.156 --> 52:40.558
Wiegel, you're naked.

52:40.625 --> 52:42.693
- I know that.
I'm being painted.

52:42.760 --> 52:44.094
- What?
- Please leave us alone.

52:44.161 --> 52:46.731
- Wiegel, Wiegel,
you are naked in the buffet.

52:46.797 --> 52:50.235
- Can we please
have some privacy?

52:50.301 --> 52:52.470
- Your friend cannot be naked
in the buffet.

52:52.537 --> 52:54.539
- I know.
- We have a sign that says so.

52:54.605 --> 52:56.006
You'd think we don't
need a sign that says,

52:56.073 --> 52:58.543
"Please do not be naked
in the buffet," but we do.

52:58.609 --> 52:59.944
- I see it.
- This is a diarrhea nightmare.

53:00.010 --> 53:02.280
- I apologize.
Trudy, please.

53:02.347 --> 53:05.316
- Don't listen to him, Trudy.
It's just you and I.

53:05.383 --> 53:07.084
- Don't worry, sugar balls.

53:07.151 --> 53:09.620
I only have ears for you.

53:09.687 --> 53:11.021
- Trudy, that's a plant.

53:11.088 --> 53:13.023
- God, you look so beautiful
right now.

53:13.090 --> 53:14.359
- Come back, Trudy.

53:14.425 --> 53:15.393
Come back!

53:15.460 --> 53:17.495
- Your jealousy is gross.

53:17.562 --> 53:19.163
- Trudy!

53:19.230 --> 53:22.132
[smooth bass music]

53:22.199 --> 53:25.336
* *

53:25.403 --> 53:27.204
- Morning, gang.

53:27.272 --> 53:28.839
all: Morning.
- Morning.

53:28.906 --> 53:31.175
- I know it hasn't been ideal...
- [PA system chimes]

53:31.242 --> 53:33.811
- If you haven't filled out
your diarrhea app,

53:33.878 --> 53:36.080
do so immediately.

53:36.146 --> 53:40.084
Failure to do so will result
in a very serious penalty.

53:40.150 --> 53:42.853
Remember, message
and data rates may apply.

53:42.920 --> 53:46.657
- Raise your hand if you forgot
to log your diarrhea today.

53:46.724 --> 53:48.726
- I didn't forget,
but I tried and it crashed.

53:48.793 --> 53:50.194
- Almost everyone!

53:50.261 --> 53:52.330
- When I say, "hell,"
you say, "o."

53:52.397 --> 53:54.699
Hello! Hello.

53:54.765 --> 53:58.503
I just got off of the phone
with the doctors

53:58.569 --> 54:00.705
from the ship
and the mainland,

54:00.771 --> 54:03.974
and I am now
certifiably insane.

54:04.041 --> 54:05.610
They actually used the word--

54:05.676 --> 54:07.578
and I never heard a doctor say
this before--

54:07.645 --> 54:09.980
cat shit crazy.

54:10.047 --> 54:12.683
So I don't want to say
screw all of you,

54:12.750 --> 54:15.453
so I will say
fuck all of you.

54:15.520 --> 54:16.821
Fuck the ship life.

54:16.887 --> 54:19.290
This jacket was
my grandfather's.

54:19.357 --> 54:21.359
They took it off his cold body.

54:21.426 --> 54:22.693
He wasn't dead yet.

54:22.760 --> 54:24.629
You can have that.
Take that for you.

54:24.695 --> 54:27.064
[exclaims]

54:27.131 --> 54:28.466
Oh!

54:28.533 --> 54:30.735
- Oh!
- [laughs]

54:30.801 --> 54:31.969
Big son of a...

54:32.036 --> 54:33.037
- I think this is cause
for concern.

54:33.103 --> 54:35.373
all: Oh!

54:35.440 --> 54:37.074
- How come he hasn't got
diarrhea?

54:37.141 --> 54:39.944
- [whistle blowing]

54:40.010 --> 54:42.046
Okay, everybody.
- Yes?

54:42.112 --> 54:43.714
- Calm down.
All calm down.

54:43.781 --> 54:45.783
- Why did you say "calm down"?
We were relatively calm.

54:45.850 --> 54:48.953
[overlapping shouting]

54:50.388 --> 54:51.822
- We were calm!

54:51.889 --> 54:53.891
[whistle blowing]
- As you can see,

54:53.958 --> 54:56.861
the captain has gone
a little bit crazy.

54:56.927 --> 54:58.963
- Certifiably cat shit crazy.

54:59.029 --> 55:01.599
- And since that is, you know,
he's a little cause for alarm,

55:01.666 --> 55:02.833
I am taking over.

55:02.900 --> 55:04.669
- I am not taking orders

55:04.735 --> 55:06.003
from another guy in shorts!

55:06.070 --> 55:08.606
- Pass. Hard pass.
- And you know what?

55:08.673 --> 55:10.908
None of you updated
your MyDiarrhea app.

55:10.975 --> 55:12.209
- I did, though!
Except for not them!

55:12.276 --> 55:13.744
But I actually did.

55:13.811 --> 55:17.314
You are not taking the ship.
Thank you, but no thank you.

55:17.382 --> 55:19.183
[gunfire, screaming]

55:19.249 --> 55:20.551
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

55:20.618 --> 55:22.420
- Put them below deck.
- Okay, okay, we'll go.

55:22.487 --> 55:24.188
[all shouting]
- No. No. No. No.

55:24.254 --> 55:25.390
- Come on!

55:25.456 --> 55:26.691
- Oh, my God.

55:26.757 --> 55:28.826
No. No, oh, my God!

55:30.294 --> 55:33.664
- Yes. Guns! Guns! Guns!
Guns! Guns!

55:33.731 --> 55:35.800
When I say "guns,"
you say, "mm!"

55:40.371 --> 55:42.139
- This is like that movie.

55:43.941 --> 55:45.209
You know, the guy
with the glasses.

55:47.077 --> 55:50.448
Come on, the one--
Come on.

55:50.515 --> 55:53.451
When you--the thing?

55:53.518 --> 55:54.719
- "Amistad"?
- Yes.

55:54.785 --> 55:56.421
- How did you get that?

55:56.487 --> 55:58.188
- I'm sorry, don't do that.

55:58.255 --> 56:01.058
Don't compare a slave ship
to what we're in.

56:01.125 --> 56:02.760
- How is this not
the exact same thing?

56:02.827 --> 56:05.329
- Black people still have
high blood pressure today

56:05.396 --> 56:07.264
because of what happened.

56:07.331 --> 56:09.199
The salt was so...

56:09.266 --> 56:11.101
- Was that the name of
that movie, by the way?

56:11.168 --> 56:12.803
- Oh, don't make this
be like the whole thing

56:12.870 --> 56:14.238
when he gives that
whole lecture about "Roots".

56:14.304 --> 56:16.507
- I'll be honest, if I was--
[PA system chimes]

56:16.574 --> 56:18.709
- Hello, everyone.
This is your captain.

56:18.776 --> 56:20.878
I hope you are having
a wonderful day.

56:20.945 --> 56:23.113
It's a good day to die.

56:23.180 --> 56:25.716
Speaking of that, I'm about
to run this ship aground

56:25.783 --> 56:27.485
and kill all of us.

56:27.552 --> 56:29.720
- Go! Go!
[all scream]

56:29.787 --> 56:32.356
Whoa! Whoa!

56:32.423 --> 56:34.525
[klaxon blaring distantly]

56:34.592 --> 56:35.993
- Everybody okay?
- Oh!

56:36.060 --> 56:37.695
- Tell you right now, people--

56:37.762 --> 56:40.831
Hands in.

56:40.898 --> 56:45.436
Heroes are not made...

56:45.503 --> 56:46.971
at a summer frolic,

56:47.037 --> 56:50.675
at a picnic with a basket

56:50.741 --> 56:53.544
of fruits, crudités,
cheeses, and meats.

56:53.611 --> 56:54.812
- What the fuck?

56:54.879 --> 56:56.046
- Maybe a sparkling white--

56:56.113 --> 56:58.182
Hero--I'm getting
to this part.

56:58.248 --> 57:01.351
Heroes are forged

57:01.418 --> 57:03.253
in fire.

57:03.320 --> 57:05.990
all: Yeah!
- [shouting angrily]

57:06.056 --> 57:07.424
Let's do something about this!

57:07.492 --> 57:08.959
- Yes! What do we do?

57:09.026 --> 57:10.194
- Are we clowns, or are we the
Reno Sheriff's Department?

57:10.260 --> 57:12.362
- We're the Reno Sheriff's
Department!

57:12.429 --> 57:15.766
[shouting gibberish]

57:15.833 --> 57:18.769
[exciting music]

57:18.836 --> 57:23.240
* *

57:23.307 --> 57:24.875
- Go, go, go, go.

57:24.942 --> 57:27.645
* *

57:27.712 --> 57:34.852
* *

57:36.954 --> 57:39.757
- These decks is off-limits,
everybody.

57:39.824 --> 57:41.191
Oh!

57:41.258 --> 57:44.261
[laughs]

57:44.328 --> 57:46.497
[all laughing]
- Hey, who did this?

57:46.564 --> 57:48.432
[screams]

57:48.499 --> 57:50.768
[water splashes]

57:50.835 --> 57:52.236
[meaty thud]
[all gasp]

57:52.302 --> 57:55.305
[mechanical whirring
and grinding]

57:55.372 --> 57:57.341
- Oh, God.

57:57.407 --> 57:58.909
Right into the propeller.

57:58.976 --> 58:01.078
- He's all mixed up
in there.

58:01.145 --> 58:02.580
- Circle of life.
Circle of life, right?

58:02.647 --> 58:04.982
- In what way?
- Um, let's not get specific.

58:05.049 --> 58:06.751
Let's--you know,
the circle of life.

58:06.817 --> 58:08.052
- Oh, shit,
we got to stop the boat.

58:08.118 --> 58:09.587
- Go.
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

58:09.654 --> 58:12.757
[speaking native language]

58:13.791 --> 58:16.894
- Let's go.

58:16.961 --> 58:18.763
- Captain!
[all shouting]

58:18.829 --> 58:20.064
- Captain, we got to stop!

58:20.130 --> 58:21.799
[overlapping shouting]

58:21.866 --> 58:24.334
- All right, step back,
step back!

58:24.401 --> 58:25.970
- Don't worry.

58:26.036 --> 58:27.638
We do stuff like this
all the time.

58:27.705 --> 58:29.774
[gunshot]
- [screams]

58:29.840 --> 58:30.841
- Sorry!

58:30.908 --> 58:32.009
Don't do it!
Don't do it!

58:32.076 --> 58:33.510
You got to let us in!

58:33.578 --> 58:34.745
- How do we stop the ship?

58:34.812 --> 58:36.881
- What if we drop the anchor?

58:36.947 --> 58:38.816
- Yeah! Go, go, go!

58:38.883 --> 58:41.686
- What if we drop the anchor?

58:41.752 --> 58:44.622
Use your lower body.
On three.

58:44.689 --> 58:45.923
[exhales sharply]

58:45.990 --> 58:47.592
One, two...

58:47.658 --> 58:50.795
[all straining]

58:52.396 --> 58:53.764
I'm getting it!
I got a little bit!

58:53.831 --> 58:55.132
I got something over here!

58:55.199 --> 58:56.601
Son of a bitch,
I had something over here.

58:56.667 --> 58:58.435
- Let's do it one more time,
'cause I have to admit,

58:58.502 --> 59:00.905
I wasn't pulling at all.
I was just going, "Ah!"

59:00.971 --> 59:03.407
- Fulcrum.
[all straining]

59:03.473 --> 59:04.809
- Anything?

59:04.875 --> 59:06.744
- Yeah, I felt it move!
I felt it move!

59:06.811 --> 59:07.978
- I got something!

59:08.045 --> 59:10.581
[overlapping shouting]

59:10.648 --> 59:13.283
- One, two, three.

59:13.350 --> 59:16.286
[all yell]

59:18.789 --> 59:20.625
- Sometimes...

59:20.691 --> 59:22.860
the best move

59:22.927 --> 59:24.895
is to admit
when you need help.

59:24.962 --> 59:25.896
- Help! Help!

59:25.963 --> 59:27.264
- Don't scream.

59:27.331 --> 59:28.833
Okay, no,
scream, scream.

59:28.899 --> 59:30.000
- Help!
- We need help!

59:30.067 --> 59:31.636
[all shouting]

59:31.702 --> 59:33.070
all: Help!

59:33.137 --> 59:35.873
- My brothers and sisters
of color,

59:35.940 --> 59:39.043
Q weirdos who actually turned
out to be pretty nice folks,

59:39.109 --> 59:43.047
America used to be great
'cause we did stuff together.

59:43.113 --> 59:44.782
Let's do this together, guys.

59:44.849 --> 59:46.016
And heave!

59:46.083 --> 59:49.153
[all yelling]

59:49.219 --> 59:51.521
Heave! Heave! Heave!

59:51.588 --> 59:56.226
Heave! And ho!

59:56.293 --> 59:59.730
Yes!
[all cheering]

59:59.797 --> 1:00:01.565
[loud crash]

1:00:01.632 --> 1:00:02.833
[water splashes]

1:00:02.900 --> 1:00:04.835
Hey, guys...

1:00:04.902 --> 1:00:06.603
we fucked up again.

1:00:06.671 --> 1:00:07.805
- Yeah, it's supposed to be
attached, right?

1:00:07.872 --> 1:00:08.806
- Yeah.

1:00:08.873 --> 1:00:10.407
all: Captain!

1:00:10.474 --> 1:00:12.042
- Capitán.
[all shouting]

1:00:12.109 --> 1:00:14.044
- Hey, listen!

1:00:14.111 --> 1:00:17.014
- I forgot, the crazy Black
captain "Bonofrise"

1:00:17.081 --> 1:00:18.716
gave me the keys!
- Oh, my God!

1:00:18.783 --> 1:00:20.985
- Let's do it.
- Go, go, go!

1:00:21.051 --> 1:00:23.287
- So much better than violence.

1:00:23.353 --> 1:00:24.588
Hey!

1:00:24.655 --> 1:00:26.691
- Gentle. Gentle.
- Why don't you come on out?

1:00:26.757 --> 1:00:28.425
Look what I got for you, huh?

1:00:28.492 --> 1:00:30.360
- Oh. Shall we?

1:00:30.427 --> 1:00:31.595
- Yes, we shall.

1:00:31.662 --> 1:00:33.297
- Great, I'm gonna maybe
turn the ship off.

1:00:33.363 --> 1:00:34.732
- I wish I'd known
you were here.

1:00:34.799 --> 1:00:36.233
I would have let you in earlier.

1:00:36.300 --> 1:00:38.502
- We did it.
- Man, you're batshit crazy.

1:00:38.568 --> 1:00:40.337
Hey! We did it!
We saved the ship!

1:00:40.404 --> 1:00:42.472
- Whoo-hoo!
- Don't have to thank us.

1:00:42.539 --> 1:00:44.141
- [shouts angrily]
- Oh, shit!

1:00:44.208 --> 1:00:47.277
- [gunfire]
[all scream]

1:00:49.479 --> 1:00:51.716
- What? What?

1:00:51.782 --> 1:00:53.150
- Are you out?

1:00:54.685 --> 1:00:56.253
- No hard feelings, right?

1:00:57.587 --> 1:01:01.125
- Mutiny in international law
is very bad.

1:01:01.191 --> 1:01:02.492
I mean, we could kill you.

1:01:02.559 --> 1:01:05.095
But we're not gonna do that,
because we nice.

1:01:05.162 --> 1:01:07.131
And we want a good
Tripadvisor review.

1:01:07.197 --> 1:01:09.299
Five star, please.
Thank you so much.

1:01:09.366 --> 1:01:10.901
- Bye.
- Bye-bye.

1:01:10.968 --> 1:01:13.037
- Bye-bye, my love.
- Bye.

1:01:13.103 --> 1:01:14.438
- Goodbye, my dear.

1:01:14.504 --> 1:01:16.006
- I left one of my panty liners

1:01:16.073 --> 1:01:17.641
under your pillow!

1:01:17.708 --> 1:01:18.976
- [whispering]
Who is she talking to?

1:01:19.043 --> 1:01:20.745
- I will wait for
you right here!

1:01:20.811 --> 1:01:22.446
Fully engorged!

1:01:22.512 --> 1:01:26.116
[boat horn blows]

1:01:26.183 --> 1:01:28.853
- Bye, bye!
[speaking native language]

1:01:28.919 --> 1:01:31.856
[dramatic music]

1:01:31.922 --> 1:01:36.460
* *

1:01:36.526 --> 1:01:37.862
[all gasp]

1:01:37.928 --> 1:01:38.996
- Oh, my God!
- What the hell?

1:01:39.063 --> 1:01:40.230
- Holy--
- Were you guys here

1:01:40.297 --> 1:01:41.498
the whole time?
- Oh, yeah.

1:01:41.565 --> 1:01:43.934
We--we turned this
into our little, um...

1:01:44.001 --> 1:01:45.669
excuse me, but fuck nest.

1:01:45.736 --> 1:01:47.671
[laughs]
- Ew!

1:01:47.738 --> 1:01:50.574
- This succubus has me
up to, like, eight seconds.

1:01:50.640 --> 1:01:52.943
Never lasted that long.
- Congratulations.

1:01:53.010 --> 1:01:54.311
- Nobody asked.

1:01:54.378 --> 1:01:57.181
- If I get into double digits,
this is the one.

1:01:57.247 --> 1:01:59.850
[sighs]
- I'll buy you an ice cream.

1:01:59.917 --> 1:02:01.819
- Oh!
- [both laugh]

1:02:01.886 --> 1:02:03.620
all: No, no, no!

1:02:03.687 --> 1:02:06.256
- Oh, come on!

1:02:06.323 --> 1:02:08.325
- Just read the raft.
Read the raft, right?

1:02:08.392 --> 1:02:11.862
- Does anybody know, like,
which way we're even drifting?

1:02:11.929 --> 1:02:13.530
That's the drinking gourd
up there.

1:02:13.597 --> 1:02:15.099
The handle points
to the North Star.

1:02:15.165 --> 1:02:19.103
- I mean, if that really is
the drinking gourd, I mean...

1:02:19.169 --> 1:02:20.470
I probably shouldn't
say this,

1:02:20.537 --> 1:02:22.539
about a hundred miles
north of here...

1:02:22.606 --> 1:02:24.942
[sighs]

1:02:25.009 --> 1:02:26.710
[whispers]
Sorry, dude.

1:02:26.777 --> 1:02:29.213
But, uh, Q's headquarters

1:02:29.279 --> 1:02:31.281
are on my friend's island.

1:02:31.348 --> 1:02:33.183
My friend had a really nice
island with a--

1:02:33.250 --> 1:02:34.819
you know, a mansion
and a sex dungeon and--

1:02:34.885 --> 1:02:36.821
- Jeff Epstein.

1:02:36.887 --> 1:02:39.156
Who else has an island
with a sex dungeon?

1:02:39.223 --> 1:02:40.124
- Okay, yeah, fine. Jeff
Epstein...

1:02:40.190 --> 1:02:41.491
- Well, David Copperfield.

1:02:41.558 --> 1:02:42.426
- David Copperfield.
- Okay, yeah.

1:02:42.492 --> 1:02:43.660
- Well, how do we get there?

1:02:43.727 --> 1:02:46.630
- Did you say 100 miles
north of here?

1:02:46.696 --> 1:02:48.966
- Yeah. I mean,
I don't really know basic,

1:02:49.033 --> 1:02:50.835
you know, boat craft or--

1:02:50.901 --> 1:02:53.737
Whoa, what are you--

1:02:53.804 --> 1:02:55.439
- There's a couple guys
in the world

1:02:55.505 --> 1:02:58.142
that could get you
100 miles north of here

1:02:58.208 --> 1:03:00.544
by the stars.

1:03:00.610 --> 1:03:01.745
And one of them...

1:03:01.812 --> 1:03:03.013
- Harriet Tubman.

1:03:03.080 --> 1:03:05.049
- Is James Ron Dangle,

1:03:05.115 --> 1:03:07.517
United States Coast Guard.

1:03:07.584 --> 1:03:09.386
I mean, discharged.
Asked to leave.

1:03:09.453 --> 1:03:11.288
- You know the story.
all: Yeah, yeah.

1:03:11.355 --> 1:03:12.622
- For sure.
- Well, wait, I mean,

1:03:12.689 --> 1:03:14.058
have you all heard it?
'Cause I haven't--

1:03:14.124 --> 1:03:15.359
- You don't need to--
- My and another fellow were

1:03:15.425 --> 1:03:16.793
asked to leave the Coast Guard
on the same day.

1:03:16.861 --> 1:03:18.462
- Nah, we don't need to...

1:03:18.528 --> 1:03:21.298
- Jim, what are you gonna do?

1:03:21.365 --> 1:03:24.268
[heroic music]

1:03:24.334 --> 1:03:31.475
* *

1:03:37.915 --> 1:03:44.821
* *

1:04:01.972 --> 1:04:04.774
- [whimpers]
- Damn.

1:04:04.841 --> 1:04:08.112
I am so over all of it.

1:04:08.178 --> 1:04:10.480
Trudy, stop slobbing on me.

1:04:10.547 --> 1:04:12.616
I'm tired of looking
at Dangle's ass,

1:04:12.682 --> 1:04:15.185
I'm hungry,
and it's all your fault, Jones.

1:04:15.252 --> 1:04:17.487
- My fault?
- You found the Booze Cruise!

1:04:17.554 --> 1:04:20.290
- My fault because I can type?
- Actually, Dangle booked it.

1:04:20.357 --> 1:04:21.691
- Dangle booked it.

1:04:21.758 --> 1:04:23.293
- Clemmie, it's you!

1:04:23.360 --> 1:04:25.229
You were the one who was
supposed to get information,

1:04:25.295 --> 1:04:26.796
instead of having a fuck nest!

1:04:26.863 --> 1:04:29.233
- Excuse me, excuse me!
- Don't you dare!

1:04:29.299 --> 1:04:31.168
- This is a love fort!

1:04:31.235 --> 1:04:33.670
- They're all just waiting to
turn on me!

1:04:33.737 --> 1:04:34.972
They all know that it was--
[loud thud]

1:04:35.039 --> 1:04:36.873
Travis? Travis?

1:04:36.941 --> 1:04:38.108
- Hey.
- Hey.

1:04:38.175 --> 1:04:39.676
- Hey, guys!
- Oh, my God.

1:04:39.743 --> 1:04:40.945
[all gasp and cheer]

1:04:41.011 --> 1:04:42.212
- Oh, my God.

1:04:42.279 --> 1:04:44.514
[all laugh]

1:04:44.581 --> 1:04:46.383
- Whoo!
- Oh, wow.

1:04:46.450 --> 1:04:47.884
- You did it, Jim.

1:04:47.952 --> 1:04:48.986
You did it.

1:04:49.053 --> 1:04:51.155
- Yeah!
Yeah, Dangle.

1:04:51.221 --> 1:04:54.158
- Followed the drinking gourd.
[laughs]

1:04:54.224 --> 1:04:57.594
- Welcome to, uh,
Jeffrey Epstein's island.

1:04:57.661 --> 1:05:00.197
You are now all our prisoners,

1:05:00.264 --> 1:05:03.867
and will be taken to trial
before Q!

1:05:03.934 --> 1:05:05.735
- What?
[guns cock]

1:05:05.802 --> 1:05:08.738
[all whimper]

1:05:11.275 --> 1:05:12.742
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Whoa, whoa!

1:05:14.945 --> 1:05:16.813
- Clemmie, you're gonna need
to decide.

1:05:16.880 --> 1:05:18.582
Are you with me--
- I'm with you, yes!

1:05:18.648 --> 1:05:19.849
- Okay, good.
- Yes.

1:05:19.916 --> 1:05:21.218
- Do you want to yell
at the minions

1:05:21.285 --> 1:05:22.619
and tell them--
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

1:05:22.686 --> 1:05:25.322
Hey, minions,
you with the colorful face.

1:05:25.389 --> 1:05:27.357
Take these losers away.

1:05:27.424 --> 1:05:28.858
I'm sorry, but it's true.
You're all losers.

1:05:28.925 --> 1:05:31.128
Take them away!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

1:05:31.195 --> 1:05:33.197
- Search their cavities.

1:05:33.263 --> 1:05:34.965
Someone has something, I swear.

1:05:35.032 --> 1:05:36.666
Sorry, not sorry!

1:05:36.733 --> 1:05:39.036
[both laugh]

1:05:39.103 --> 1:05:40.737
- Oh! I love our lives.

1:05:40.804 --> 1:05:42.106
Oh.

1:05:42.172 --> 1:05:45.109
[tense music]

1:05:45.175 --> 1:05:49.346

1:05:49.413 --> 1:05:52.316
[indistinct radio chatter]

1:05:52.382 --> 1:05:56.886
* *

1:05:56.953 --> 1:05:58.388
- Hello?

1:05:58.455 --> 1:06:03.060
* *

1:06:03.127 --> 1:06:06.063
[dramatic music]

1:06:06.130 --> 1:06:13.270
* *

1:06:19.943 --> 1:06:26.850
* *

1:06:28.518 --> 1:06:30.220
- I love the open concept.

1:06:30.287 --> 1:06:37.427
* *

1:06:40.997 --> 1:06:42.666
- I'm impressed, Sheriff.

1:06:42.732 --> 1:06:44.601
- I'm actually not the sheriff.

1:06:44.668 --> 1:06:46.670
I'm Lieutenant James Ron Dangle,

1:06:46.736 --> 1:06:47.971
Reno Sheriff's Department.

1:06:48.038 --> 1:06:51.007
Also, uh, amateur puppeteer.
Almost went pro--

1:06:51.075 --> 1:06:52.809
[yelps]

1:06:55.312 --> 1:06:57.681
- So are you Q?

1:06:57.747 --> 1:07:00.250
- [laughs]

1:07:00.317 --> 1:07:03.787
Don't play stupid, Officer.

1:07:03.853 --> 1:07:05.855
- She's not playing.
That was a legitimate question.

1:07:05.922 --> 1:07:08.092
- She's really
not the bright.

1:07:08.158 --> 1:07:09.826
- You should all be very happy
with yourselves.

1:07:09.893 --> 1:07:12.629
No one else has ever gotten
this far.

1:07:12.696 --> 1:07:17.334
So you came all this way
to find out who Q really is.

1:07:17.401 --> 1:07:19.069
- Yeah, that's right.

1:07:19.136 --> 1:07:20.837
- Well, I'll tell you.

1:07:20.904 --> 1:07:25.642
Years ago, a ship wrecked
on this very island,

1:07:25.709 --> 1:07:30.347
carrying a brilliant
and deranged professor.

1:07:30.414 --> 1:07:31.715
That professor...

1:07:31.781 --> 1:07:33.550
- Was Q.

1:07:33.617 --> 1:07:35.119
- Died in the wreck.

1:07:35.185 --> 1:07:36.386
- Okay.

1:07:36.453 --> 1:07:39.923
- But we found this...

1:07:39.989 --> 1:07:41.958
in the wreckage.

1:07:42.025 --> 1:07:44.994
* *

1:07:45.061 --> 1:07:47.197
- Uh, brother man, that--

1:07:47.264 --> 1:07:48.232
that's a Speak & Spell.

1:07:48.298 --> 1:07:49.799
- Yes, it is.

1:07:49.866 --> 1:07:51.868
Or, it was.

1:07:51.935 --> 1:07:53.637
Time and providence,

1:07:53.703 --> 1:07:56.039
and probably
saltwater corrosion,

1:07:56.106 --> 1:08:00.410
has altered its programming...

1:08:00.477 --> 1:08:02.146
imbuing it...

1:08:02.212 --> 1:08:05.382
and I'm not sure if I'm using
the word "imbuing" correctly.

1:08:05.449 --> 1:08:07.417
But it infused it--

1:08:07.484 --> 1:08:09.586
it infused it...
- Infused.

1:08:09.653 --> 1:08:11.455
- With a dynamic,
divine wisdom...

1:08:11.521 --> 1:08:13.557
- Oh. Yeah, okay.

1:08:13.623 --> 1:08:16.893
- That Q imparts
and we disseminate.

1:08:16.960 --> 1:08:18.462
- Oh, I get it.

1:08:18.528 --> 1:08:21.365
So you guys are just
batshit crazy.

1:08:21.431 --> 1:08:22.899
- Wait.

1:08:22.966 --> 1:08:24.201
Listen.

1:08:24.268 --> 1:08:26.336
- Hmm?
- And learn.

1:08:26.403 --> 1:08:29.539

1:08:34.144 --> 1:08:35.979
[Speak & Spell chimes]

1:08:36.045 --> 1:08:38.515

1:08:38.582 --> 1:08:41.050
- [laughs]

1:08:41.117 --> 1:08:42.519
- Oprah has bears.

1:08:42.586 --> 1:08:44.954
Oprah has bears!

1:08:45.021 --> 1:08:47.090
Let it be known
that Oprah has bears.

1:08:47.157 --> 1:08:49.359
Go to your mobile devices,

1:08:49.426 --> 1:08:51.695
get the word out on 8chan.

1:08:51.761 --> 1:08:53.463
- This is a dumb,
dumb question.

1:08:53.530 --> 1:08:56.300
This isn't how
the whole thing works, right?

1:08:56.366 --> 1:08:58.535
[nervous laughter]

1:08:58.602 --> 1:09:00.704
It is--
- It is, definitely.

1:09:00.770 --> 1:09:03.106
- That's words, and then you...

1:09:03.173 --> 1:09:04.741
put the words on an 8chan.

1:09:04.808 --> 1:09:06.576
- It actually checks out
more than I would have thought.

1:09:06.643 --> 1:09:07.777
- Yep.
[Speak & Spell chimes]

1:09:07.844 --> 1:09:10.079
- The flu is from France.

1:09:10.146 --> 1:09:13.517
- It's true, because sometimes
the flu is from France.

1:09:13.583 --> 1:09:15.985
- But as often as not
it's not, actually.

1:09:16.052 --> 1:09:18.422
- Well, sometimes it is.
[overlapping chatter]

1:09:18.488 --> 1:09:20.590
- To the dungeon with them.

1:09:20.657 --> 1:09:23.092
And go through the bunker.
It's faster.

1:09:23.159 --> 1:09:26.563
And tell Ron to set off
that bomb.

1:09:26.630 --> 1:09:29.333
The big one that will destroy
the island.

1:09:29.399 --> 1:09:30.634
- Oh, my God!

1:09:30.700 --> 1:09:32.168
We will not--
you do not have to kill us!

1:09:32.236 --> 1:09:34.504
You do not have to kill us!

1:09:34.571 --> 1:09:36.440
- Go, go, go, go.
- We won't remember!

1:09:36.506 --> 1:09:38.174
- Come on.
- Blow them up.

1:09:38.242 --> 1:09:41.478
- Can I just ask you
where you got that rag?

1:09:41.545 --> 1:09:42.879
- Walmart.

1:09:42.946 --> 1:09:44.881
- That's nice--
that's real nice.

1:09:44.948 --> 1:09:47.717
- Clever, clever interlopers.

1:09:47.784 --> 1:09:49.085
- We're not clever!

1:09:49.152 --> 1:09:50.354
- Ow! Ow!

1:09:50.420 --> 1:09:51.721
- Oh, hey, hey, ho!

1:09:54.057 --> 1:09:56.560
- Sorry, I'm just a little
excited right now.

1:09:56.626 --> 1:09:58.228
I've, uh-- [clears throat]

1:09:58.295 --> 1:09:59.729
I've always wanted a monologue,

1:09:59.796 --> 1:10:04.200
a secret fortress with
a smoking-hot vixen next to me.

1:10:04.268 --> 1:10:05.969
- You do look hot, Clemmie.

1:10:06.035 --> 1:10:07.737
- You look rad.
- Damn!

1:10:07.804 --> 1:10:08.972
- The whole thing.
Show the whole thing.

1:10:09.038 --> 1:10:11.675
- Look at that. Oh!
- Yes, queen!

1:10:11.741 --> 1:10:13.109
- Work!
- Work.

1:10:13.176 --> 1:10:15.412
- Marlene Dietrich in the front,
Stevie Nicks in the back.

1:10:15.479 --> 1:10:16.880
- [laughs]
Oh.

1:10:16.946 --> 1:10:18.848
- We've got the whole
nerve center here,

1:10:18.915 --> 1:10:21.585
feeding all the greatest hits
into the algorithm.

1:10:21.651 --> 1:10:23.853
You know,
the standard conspiracies.

1:10:23.920 --> 1:10:27.223
Moon landing faked,
pumpkins aren't real,

1:10:27.291 --> 1:10:28.858
Joe Rogan is a hologram.

1:10:28.925 --> 1:10:32.962
The, uh, gluten-free diet,
um, causes levitation.

1:10:33.029 --> 1:10:35.999
Um, that's a really good one.
Great work.

1:10:36.065 --> 1:10:38.668
Now, of course,
that you've, uh...

1:10:38.735 --> 1:10:40.704
seen all of this,

1:10:40.770 --> 1:10:43.172
I have to blow it up.

1:10:43.239 --> 1:10:45.475
- What?
- Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no!

1:10:45.542 --> 1:10:47.577
[all shouting]

1:10:47.644 --> 1:10:49.145
- Silence!
- I'm out!

1:10:49.212 --> 1:10:53.650
- A bomb this exquisite
can only be set in motion

1:10:53.717 --> 1:10:56.019
by somebody as exquisite.

1:10:56.085 --> 1:10:57.854
- Clemmie, what about all those
great times that we had?

1:10:57.921 --> 1:10:59.323
Remember all those
great times we had?

1:10:59.389 --> 1:11:00.490
- Suck it, monkeys.

1:11:00.557 --> 1:11:01.958
- [laughs]

1:11:02.025 --> 1:11:04.294
- Hey, cut it out.
- Hey!

1:11:04.361 --> 1:11:05.929
- Hey, now, Clemmie.

1:11:05.995 --> 1:11:07.297
- Oh!
- Come on now.

1:11:07.364 --> 1:11:08.598
- Oh!

1:11:08.665 --> 1:11:11.067
Anyway, we would love
to stick around,

1:11:11.134 --> 1:11:13.002
but we have to, um,

1:11:13.069 --> 1:11:14.671
pack up a lot of money
and pills, right?

1:11:14.738 --> 1:11:16.205
- Money and pills.
- Money and pills.

1:11:16.272 --> 1:11:18.141
Glenn, to the dungeon.

1:11:18.207 --> 1:11:21.110
[overlapping shouting]

1:11:22.379 --> 1:11:24.013
- No, no, no, no, no!

1:11:24.080 --> 1:11:25.582
No!

1:11:25.649 --> 1:11:28.718
- Is this the first time you've
had hour friends blown up?

1:11:28.785 --> 1:11:31.287
It's hard the first time,
but it gets easier.

1:11:31.355 --> 1:11:32.389
- Does it?
- It really does.

1:11:32.456 --> 1:11:33.390
Trust me, sweetie.

1:11:33.457 --> 1:11:34.924
[both giggle]

1:11:34.991 --> 1:11:37.026

gonna live for?

1:11:37.093 --> 1:11:38.562
Nothing.

1:11:38.628 --> 1:11:40.630
- Sir?
- Is there gonna be, like,

1:11:40.697 --> 1:11:42.599
snacks or anything?

1:11:42.666 --> 1:11:44.401

Glenn, was it?

- Hey, Glenn.

1:11:55.912 --> 1:11:57.881
this is a really nice
sex dungeon.

this domination gear.

1:12:03.186 --> 1:12:06.890
They're an outfit out of Bruges
called Pamplemousse & Thunder.

1:12:06.956 --> 1:12:08.324
I mean, this is some
of the nice stuff.

1:12:08.392 --> 1:12:10.460
Some of this is actually
next year's stuff, by the way.

1:12:10.527 --> 1:12:12.195
Literally, they advertise

1:12:12.261 --> 1:12:14.097
that your submissives
will never escape.

1:12:14.163 --> 1:12:15.565
So I don't want
to be a bummer,

this is it.

- Do you have to go
to the restroom?

1:12:50.033 --> 1:12:53.069
- No, I think we're really
gonna die in here.

1:12:53.136 --> 1:12:54.904

- Don't say that.

- Even though
it's probably true.

1:12:57.774 --> 1:12:59.743
- It's kind of funny
if you think about it.

1:12:59.809 --> 1:13:01.344
all: No, no.

1:13:01.411 --> 1:13:03.012

the whole vibe right there.

This is really, really bad,

1:13:04.648 --> 1:13:06.082

1:13:06.149 --> 1:13:08.718
I feel sorry
mostly for me and Rai-Rai,

1:13:08.785 --> 1:13:11.320
'cause this--
this is really bad for us.

1:13:11.387 --> 1:13:13.723

Guys, can we not agree

1:13:13.790 --> 1:13:15.792
this sucks equally
pretty much for all of us?

1:13:15.859 --> 1:13:18.027
- No! No! No, we can't agree.
- Yes! Yes!

1:13:18.094 --> 1:13:21.197

It looks worse for us, Jim.

1:13:21.264 --> 1:13:22.766

kind of go with it.

If we're dying, we're dying.

1:13:24.033 --> 1:13:25.669
But can we do it
in silence?

I think his math was wrong.

I think he miscounted by nine.

1:22:01.084 --> 1:22:02.818
doing my puppetry,

1:22:02.885 --> 1:22:04.720
making that--
making that puppetry money?

1:22:04.787 --> 1:22:06.389
Which--it's not--

1:22:06.455 --> 1:22:09.158
I've never--I've never, ever
done the puppetry

1:22:09.225 --> 1:22:10.659
just for the money.

1:22:10.726 --> 1:22:12.028
That said,

1:22:12.095 --> 1:22:15.398
I've been doing it here
on the streets a bit.

1:22:15.464 --> 1:22:16.732
You know, and in many ways
that's great,

1:22:16.799 --> 1:22:19.068
'cause I'm also just outside,
you know?

1:22:19.135 --> 1:22:20.569
Just to be outside at all.

1:22:20.636 --> 1:22:22.538
- Hey, no smoke inside!

1:22:22.605 --> 1:22:24.440
- I'm putting it out.
I'm already putting it out.

1:22:26.409 --> 1:22:28.611
- I needed adventure,
and I got it,

1:22:28.677 --> 1:22:32.848
and I have a renewed
sense of purpose.

1:22:32.915 --> 1:22:35.184
And you're probably asking,
well, what about Ron?

1:22:35.251 --> 1:22:36.319
What about him?

1:22:36.385 --> 1:22:38.054
If you're asking me
as a deputy,

1:22:38.121 --> 1:22:41.124
I have no idea about Ron.

1:22:41.190 --> 1:22:43.492
If you're asking me as Clemmie

1:22:43.559 --> 1:22:45.861
the woman, the goddess, um,

1:22:45.928 --> 1:22:47.396
of course I know
exactly where he is.

1:22:47.463 --> 1:22:48.564
I'm not stupid.

1:22:48.631 --> 1:22:50.566
I know a good thing
when I see it.

1:22:52.468 --> 1:22:53.469
Hey, handsome.

1:22:53.536 --> 1:22:54.903
- Oh!
- [chuckles]

1:22:54.970 --> 1:22:58.074
- I waive my rights.

1:22:58.141 --> 1:22:59.308
- I got to be honest.

1:22:59.375 --> 1:23:02.145
I took a lot of money from Q.

1:23:02.211 --> 1:23:03.879
And I would do it again.

1:23:03.946 --> 1:23:06.415
But don't worry,
I'm doing good things with it.

1:23:07.583 --> 1:23:09.685
I brought all my friends
along with me.

1:23:09.752 --> 1:23:11.420
[all laugh]

1:23:11.487 --> 1:23:14.190
Hey, I'm sorry
I almost left you for dead.

1:23:14.257 --> 1:23:15.258
- Forget it.

1:23:15.324 --> 1:23:16.492
- It's all right.
- It's forgotten.

1:23:16.559 --> 1:23:17.426
- The important thing is
you're here now.

1:23:17.493 --> 1:23:19.328
- We are a family.

1:23:19.395 --> 1:23:20.896
- Familia.
- I love you guys.

1:23:20.963 --> 1:23:22.998
all: Cheers!

1:23:23.066 --> 1:23:24.567
[all whoop]

1:23:24.633 --> 1:23:26.769
- What a beautiful night
for an evening.

1:23:26.835 --> 1:23:29.072
- Oh, it sure is.

1:23:29.138 --> 1:23:30.639
To us.

1:23:30.706 --> 1:23:32.075
- Stand behind me like this.

1:23:32.141 --> 1:23:33.542
- Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1:23:33.609 --> 1:23:35.178
- Let's human centipede it.

1:23:35.244 --> 1:23:37.380
We'll do a human centipede
Titanic.

1:23:37.446 --> 1:23:39.815
all:
Human centipede Titanic!

1:23:39.882 --> 1:23:42.485
Human centipede Titanic!

1:23:42.551 --> 1:23:44.953
Human centipede Titanic!

1:23:45.020 --> 1:23:47.256
Human centipede Titanic!
- Ow! Ow! Ow!

1:23:47.323 --> 1:23:49.125
- Guys,
we're crushing her uterus.

1:23:49.192 --> 1:23:51.960
We're crushing her uterus.

1:23:52.027 --> 1:23:53.629
- * Don't wanna stop *
- * And our hearts *

1:23:53.696 --> 1:23:56.299
* They beat as one *

1:23:56.365 --> 1:23:57.733
* Ooh, yeah *

1:23:57.800 --> 1:24:00.769
* No more love on the run *

1:24:02.538 --> 1:24:04.473
* Yeah *

1:24:04.540 --> 1:24:11.680
* *

1:24:36.572 --> 1:24:38.974
* Caribbean Queen *

1:24:39.041 --> 1:24:43.112
* Now we're sharing
the same dream *

1:24:43.179 --> 1:24:46.949
* And our hearts,
they beat as one *

1:24:47.015 --> 1:24:48.651
* Oh, yeah *

1:24:48.717 --> 1:24:51.787
* No more love on the run *

1:24:51.854 --> 1:24:53.822
* Yeah *
