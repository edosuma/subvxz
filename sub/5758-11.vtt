WEBVTT

00:04.598 --> 00:06.332
<i>You gonna take care of me</i>
<i>like you took care of Alison?</i>

00:06.367 --> 00:08.435
'Cause she found
your home movies?

00:08.469 --> 00:11.306
We were friends of Ali's.
Me, too. I'm Cece.

00:13.707 --> 00:15.443
Oh, you're bleeding!

00:15.563 --> 00:17.464
Hanna, are you in
some kind of trouble?

00:17.498 --> 00:18.543
No.

00:18.663 --> 00:20.112
So she told you about Maggie.

00:20.232 --> 00:22.436
Ezra gets her pregnant,
wants to do the right thing,

00:22.470 --> 00:26.240
and then my mom shows up
with her magic purse strings.

00:26.274 --> 00:29.176
That was definitely stolen
from Ali's grave.

00:37.285 --> 00:39.253
Okay,
nothing fits over this.

00:39.287 --> 00:41.321
Well, Hanna, if you just wait
until your mom goes to work,

00:41.356 --> 00:42.534
then we don't have
to sneak around.

00:42.654 --> 00:43.851
No, I am not going to school
with a big open wound.

00:43.971 --> 00:45.534
I thought you said
Wren stitched it up.

00:45.630 --> 00:49.666
He did, but I have to let it breathe
or else it could get infected.

00:49.701 --> 00:52.599
Whoa. When did you get that?

00:52.719 --> 00:53.637
Eighth grade.

00:53.671 --> 00:55.639
Did it come with castanets?

00:55.673 --> 00:57.641
It's not Spanish, it's Greek.

00:57.675 --> 00:59.810
I played "Peasant lady"
<i>Mamma Mia.</i>

00:59.844 --> 01:01.812
Can you give me
some pins, please?

01:01.846 --> 01:03.680
I don't remember you
in <i>Mamma Mia.</i>

01:03.715 --> 01:05.682
Good, because
I look fat and hideous

01:05.717 --> 01:07.818
and I had to stand
next to a cardboard goat.

01:12.523 --> 01:14.791
Um, Wren is calling you.

01:19.831 --> 01:22.933
Why don't you
wanna talk to him?

01:22.967 --> 01:25.769
What's going on
with you and Wren?

01:25.803 --> 01:27.604
Nothing.

01:27.638 --> 01:30.574
Hanna. Hanna,
come on, look at me.

01:30.608 --> 01:34.711
Okay, I know that "A" has made it
incredibly hard for you and Caleb.

01:34.746 --> 01:35.946
"Hard"? Try impossible.

01:35.980 --> 01:38.648
So, what, is Wren moving in?

01:38.683 --> 01:40.617
Look, I know that
he can be persuasive.

01:40.651 --> 01:41.985
I mean,
the dimples, the accent--

01:42.019 --> 01:43.820
Okay, can we not
talk about this?

01:43.855 --> 01:46.757
You are not the first girl
to fall for Downton Grabby.

01:46.791 --> 01:48.658
Hello, I've been there.

01:48.693 --> 01:50.794
Well, I'm not... there.

01:52.830 --> 01:56.600
Now what?

01:56.634 --> 01:57.901
Ugh, is she ever gonna leave?!

01:59.570 --> 02:00.537
Hey.
Hey.

02:00.571 --> 02:01.805
Uh, if you're on your way out--

02:01.839 --> 02:03.607
No, I was just making
some coffee to go.

02:03.641 --> 02:05.942
You want some?
Oh, no, thanks. I just...

02:05.977 --> 02:10.814
Something came up at the church and I wanted
to speak to you before I contacted the police.

02:10.848 --> 02:11.815
Police?

02:11.849 --> 02:13.583
The contractor who's renovating

02:13.618 --> 02:15.585
found something
under a back pew.

02:15.620 --> 02:16.820
Looks like it's
been there for awhile.

02:16.854 --> 02:19.723
What is it?
Thumb drive.

02:19.757 --> 02:22.959
I plugged it into my computer, hoping
I could return it to whoever lost it.

02:22.994 --> 02:24.528
It's not mine.

02:24.562 --> 02:25.962
That's not why
I brought it here.

02:25.997 --> 02:28.832
It turned out to be
a number of video files.

02:28.866 --> 02:31.835
The first one I opened...
Hanna's in it.

02:31.869 --> 02:35.939
Looks like she's hanging out with a group
of friends in a bedroom, just talking.

02:35.973 --> 02:40.143
But I don't think they knew
they were being filmed.

02:40.178 --> 02:43.914
There was a bully targeting Hanna
and her friends last year.

02:43.948 --> 02:45.182
That's what I threw
to get away from Ian.

02:45.216 --> 02:46.917
I thought Ian took it.
So did I.

02:46.951 --> 02:48.084
This is so bad.

02:48.119 --> 02:49.753
No, Hanna, it's gonna be fine.

02:49.787 --> 02:51.922
No, Ali used those videos
to blackmail Jenna, all right?

02:51.956 --> 02:53.023
We promised
we'd keep them locked up.

02:53.057 --> 02:54.090
Okay, but we didn't find this.

02:54.125 --> 02:55.091
It doesn't matter.

02:55.126 --> 02:56.760
If my mom takes them
to the police,

02:56.794 --> 02:57.928
then Jenna will think
that I gave them to her.

02:57.962 --> 02:59.029
Hanna, you need to chill.

02:59.063 --> 03:00.931
Me and Caleb,
that's who she'll go after.

03:00.965 --> 03:03.733
Not you. Me.
This is so bad!

03:03.768 --> 03:04.835
I better be going.

03:04.869 --> 03:06.703
I'll definitely look.

03:09.106 --> 03:11.908
You free for
a late dinner tonight?

03:11.943 --> 03:15.912
Just so I could end your day
better than I started it?

03:15.947 --> 03:17.881
Call me later.
Yeah.

03:37.101 --> 03:39.736
Hanna...

03:39.770 --> 03:42.105
What are you doing?

03:42.139 --> 03:45.976
<i>♪ Got a secret,</i>
<i>can you keep it ♪</i>

03:46.010 --> 03:48.035
<i>♪ swear this one you'll save</i>

03:48.152 --> 03:50.320
<i>♪ better lock it</i>
<i>in your pocket ♪</i>

03:50.355 --> 03:53.123
<i>♪ taking this one</i>
<i>to the grave ♪</i>

03:53.157 --> 03:58.095
♪ if I show you then I know you
<i>won't tell what I said ♪</i>

03:58.129 --> 04:03.023
<i>♪ 'cause two can keep a secret</i>
<i>if one of them is dead ♪</i>

04:04.893 --> 04:06.147
Did you know
about these videos?

04:06.265 --> 04:07.818
No, of course not.

04:07.938 --> 04:10.135
Who took these videos? Mona?

04:11.590 --> 04:13.271
Hanna...
Yes.

04:13.306 --> 04:15.006
They're Mona's, all right?

04:15.041 --> 04:17.242
But that's over with,
so can I just trash it?

04:17.276 --> 04:19.322
If she planned to use these
to blackmail you--

04:19.442 --> 04:22.280
Mom, she had a meltdown, all right?
But she's better now.

04:22.315 --> 04:25.016
What is the point
of handing it to the police?

04:25.051 --> 04:27.352
So they can move her from a
hospital room to a jail cell?

04:27.386 --> 04:30.088
This might come as a shock to you,
but I am not Mona's biggest fan.

04:30.122 --> 04:31.173
Can you just let me have it?

04:31.293 --> 04:32.933
No, I won't.

04:34.528 --> 04:37.395
I plan to watch these
by the end of the day.

04:37.430 --> 04:40.298
And then I will decide
what action to take.

04:41.295 --> 04:43.535
All right, let's go.
I'll drive you to school.

04:43.569 --> 04:47.138
Then you can explain to me why you're
wearing your costume from <i>Mamma Mia.</i>

04:54.313 --> 04:58.283
Hey. You're still sleeping?

04:58.317 --> 05:00.285
Am I?

05:00.319 --> 05:01.987
Happy birthday.

05:04.156 --> 05:06.958
Ah, give me a second.

05:06.993 --> 05:09.160
I'll be more charming
when I'm awake.

05:09.195 --> 05:11.162
I was up late.

05:11.197 --> 05:12.998
Really late.
Why?

05:13.032 --> 05:15.333
When we got off the phone, you said
you were almost done with work.

05:15.368 --> 05:18.336
Yeah, I got sidetracked.

05:18.371 --> 05:21.373
I wrote an email...
To Maggie.

05:21.407 --> 05:23.375
Oh.

05:23.409 --> 05:26.344
I didn't send it.
Why not?

05:26.379 --> 05:30.282
What if her life spiraled out of
control after my mom sent her off?

05:30.316 --> 05:33.118
Wait, two days ago
you were assuring me

05:33.152 --> 05:35.954
that Maggie was ancient
history, you had moved on.

05:35.988 --> 05:38.223
Why are you suddenly assuming the worst?
What happened?

05:38.257 --> 05:42.060
Hearing what my mother did to you
at the museum really threw me.

05:42.094 --> 05:47.065
Hey. You're not spending
your birthday like this.

05:47.099 --> 05:50.402
So just call her
and see how she is.

05:50.436 --> 05:53.305
I can't. It's not fair for me
to crash into her life.

05:53.339 --> 05:56.308
I just wanna know
if she's okay.

06:07.887 --> 06:09.087
Do you wanna finish this?

06:09.121 --> 06:11.089
No, thanks.

06:13.292 --> 06:15.226
So what do you
have first period?

06:15.261 --> 06:17.028
English.

06:17.063 --> 06:19.998
I already asked you that, didn't I?
Yeah.

06:20.032 --> 06:23.902
What's going on, Em?

06:28.974 --> 06:33.044
A couple of nights ago,
when I was comforting Nate...

06:33.079 --> 06:35.046
Things got a little intense.

06:37.116 --> 06:39.117
We kissed.

06:44.190 --> 06:46.157
Why do you think that happened?

06:46.192 --> 06:49.060
In the moment, it felt right.

06:49.095 --> 06:51.262
And now?
I don't know.

06:51.297 --> 06:53.865
I'm just as confused
by this as you.

06:53.899 --> 06:55.266
I'm not confused by it.

06:55.301 --> 06:58.036
I think you miss Maya.

06:58.070 --> 07:01.039
And so does he.

07:01.073 --> 07:03.241
You both loved the same person.

07:03.275 --> 07:08.146
Doesn't mean you feel
that way toward each other.

07:08.180 --> 07:10.949
Maybe those lines are just
a little blurry right now.

07:14.320 --> 07:16.121
So it was there the whole time?

07:16.155 --> 07:17.222
Yeah. Hanna's freaking.

07:17.256 --> 07:19.157
She's terrified
of what Jenna's gonna do.

07:19.191 --> 07:22.827
I thought that we were backing off the
whole Noel and Jenna are the "A" team.

07:22.862 --> 07:24.996
I am, but Hanna
won't listen to me.

07:25.030 --> 07:26.097
Are you?

07:26.132 --> 07:28.967
I'm sorry.

07:29.001 --> 07:30.969
I'm just trying
to figure out a way

07:31.003 --> 07:34.139
to say "Happy Birthday"
without the "happy."

07:34.173 --> 07:35.206
Birthday?

07:35.241 --> 07:37.876
Yeah, Ezra's not in the mood
to celebrate.

07:37.910 --> 07:40.311
He's obsessed. He's convinced
that he's ruined Maggie's life.

07:40.346 --> 07:42.881
Well, why is he still thinking
about his high school girlfriend?

07:42.915 --> 07:45.850
Probably because
I pushed him to.

07:45.885 --> 07:48.186
God, I just...

07:48.220 --> 07:50.088
I just wish
that there was a way

07:50.122 --> 07:51.956
that I could
get in touch with her.

07:51.991 --> 07:53.224
That is a terrible idea.

07:53.259 --> 07:54.325
No, no, no.
I just want--

07:54.360 --> 07:56.227
That is such a terrible idea.

07:56.262 --> 07:58.163
Stay out of it.
It is none of your business.

07:58.197 --> 08:00.965
It is my relationship, Spencer.

08:01.000 --> 08:04.202
I'm sorry. We can't move
forward until he does.

08:06.205 --> 08:09.841
What is she doing
back in high school?

08:09.875 --> 08:11.976
I don't think she ever left.

08:13.913 --> 08:15.079
See ya.

08:23.255 --> 08:26.891
Hey, Cece?
What are you doing?

08:26.926 --> 08:28.059
Panicking.

08:28.093 --> 08:30.061
It's almost show time
and I thought I had some help,

08:30.095 --> 08:31.896
but I never
heard back from you.

08:31.931 --> 08:33.998
That trunk show's tonight?
Oh, my God, I spaced.

08:34.033 --> 08:35.166
Yeah. Yeah, you really did.

08:35.201 --> 08:37.034
But don't sweat it, sweetheart.

08:37.068 --> 08:39.236
Hopefully there are some other
fashionistas in this fleece-loving town

08:39.270 --> 08:42.039
that'll skip a kegger
for a free belt.

08:42.073 --> 08:43.908
I will be there, okay?
I promise.

08:43.943 --> 08:45.910
And I'll get all my friends to help you.
Thanks.

08:45.945 --> 08:47.245
I was kinda hoping
after that U-Penn favor,

08:47.279 --> 08:48.980
I wouldn't have to ask twice.

08:49.014 --> 08:50.081
I'm really sorry.

08:50.115 --> 08:51.916
Do you have any rich friends
I can put in the seats?

08:51.951 --> 08:54.853
I really need to rack up
some serious cash.

08:54.887 --> 08:57.288
Whoa. Hold on.

08:57.323 --> 08:59.991
Is Emily into her?

09:00.025 --> 09:03.228
Who? Paige? Yeah,
they're dating. Why?

09:03.262 --> 09:06.264
Oh, my God.
That is seriously so messed up.

09:06.298 --> 09:07.932
If Alison were alive

09:07.967 --> 09:10.068
to see Emily cuddling up
to "Pigskin"...

09:10.102 --> 09:11.236
Sorry, who's "Pigskin"?

09:11.270 --> 09:12.937
Her.

09:12.972 --> 09:16.307
Alison and that wench
had it out for each other.

09:18.978 --> 09:21.880
That looks amazing on you, Spencer.
Ali, look at that top.

09:21.914 --> 09:22.881
Sweet.

09:22.915 --> 09:25.216
I'll trade you.
Why?

09:25.251 --> 09:27.085
Oh, come on, hon.

09:27.119 --> 09:29.287
That's not the part of your bod
you wanna advertise.

09:29.321 --> 09:32.857
Show off those Hastings' legs.

09:32.892 --> 09:36.160
Come on, let me try it on.
Please?

09:44.937 --> 09:47.171
Ouch.
Ali, how'd you get that?

09:47.206 --> 09:48.273
How'd I get what?

09:49.942 --> 09:51.075
Oh, that.

09:51.110 --> 09:54.913
Yeah, I fell down in soccer
and "Pigskin" kicked me.

09:54.947 --> 09:56.314
Who's "Pigskin"?

09:56.348 --> 09:58.917
She's just this freakazoid
in my gym class.

09:58.951 --> 10:02.086
Don't worry,
it won't happen again.

10:02.121 --> 10:04.272
Wait, is that the girl
who threw that muffin at you?

10:04.392 --> 10:07.058
No, that's "Triple Nipple."
She's harmless.

10:07.092 --> 10:08.927
"Pigskin" is psychotic.

10:08.961 --> 10:10.261
Why do you call her "Pigskin"?

10:10.296 --> 10:12.931
'Cause she's got these
weird bumps on her thighs.

10:12.965 --> 10:15.033
I mean, she says it's eczema,
but I'm like,

10:15.067 --> 10:17.869
"Honey, you better stop poking
yourself below the equator."

10:17.903 --> 10:20.872
Wait. Who is this person?
What's her real name?

10:20.906 --> 10:22.140
Doesn't matter.

10:22.174 --> 10:24.909
Once I'm done
with that no-neck bitch,

10:24.944 --> 10:26.244
she won't even exist.

10:27.674 --> 10:30.114
Looks like we got a winner.

10:30.149 --> 10:32.250
Sorry, Spence.

10:32.284 --> 10:36.187
There's no way I can unload
all those boxes by myself.

10:36.221 --> 10:39.924
He guaranteed the shipment today.
So can you do it?

10:39.959 --> 10:41.225
Sorry, what?

10:41.260 --> 10:44.062
After school?
Help me set up?

10:44.096 --> 10:45.263
Uh, yeah. Yeah, sure.

10:45.297 --> 10:48.199
Excellent. Thanks.

10:57.343 --> 11:00.244
If this thing goes to the cops,
we'll both be run off the road.

11:00.279 --> 11:02.180
<i>Should I steal it?</i>

11:12.291 --> 11:13.992
<i>So what should I do?</i>

11:27.072 --> 11:29.974
<i>I'm finding it really hard</i>
<i>not to come over there</i>

11:30.009 --> 11:32.043
<i>and kiss you.</i>

11:36.250 --> 11:39.183
Other people need
to use the computers, too.

11:39.218 --> 11:40.952
Your time is up.

12:04.719 --> 12:06.687
Hey.

12:06.721 --> 12:07.659
Hey there.

12:07.766 --> 12:09.733
Nice wheels.
Not mine.

12:09.768 --> 12:11.969
I borrowed Paige's bike 'cause
I've gotta race to swim practice.

12:12.003 --> 12:14.738
I bet she doesn't look as good
as you taking those corners.

12:14.773 --> 12:17.741
Look, I called you because--
I'm glad you did.

12:17.776 --> 12:19.677
I hope you haven't eaten yet.
I'm starving.

12:19.711 --> 12:21.078
You wanna grab a slice?

12:21.112 --> 12:23.914
Um, no, but I'll walk with you.

12:23.948 --> 12:26.917
What time is your practice over?
I'm done at seven.

12:26.951 --> 12:28.919
I thought maybe if you
wanted to go into Philly,

12:28.953 --> 12:31.088
could catch a movie,
have some dinner after.

12:31.122 --> 12:32.956
There's this place
on South Street--

12:32.991 --> 12:34.925
Nate, slow down.

12:34.959 --> 12:39.697
Sorry. It'd just be nice to spend
time with you outside of this town.

12:39.731 --> 12:43.767
I know. I just think before we
make plans, we need to talk.

12:43.802 --> 12:46.837
Look, I think we need to keep
things on a friendship level.

12:46.871 --> 12:48.939
But what about the other night?

12:48.973 --> 12:51.909
I don't regret it,
but it doesn't change things.

12:54.112 --> 12:56.914
Wow.

12:56.948 --> 13:00.017
You and Maya really did have
a lot in common, didn't you?

13:00.051 --> 13:01.185
What does that mean?

13:01.219 --> 13:04.822
She always used to say
she was being spontaneous,

13:04.856 --> 13:06.790
but really she
was just being reckless.

13:06.825 --> 13:08.692
I wasn't being reckless, Nate.

13:08.727 --> 13:09.827
You can stop.

13:09.861 --> 13:12.096
I remember Maya,
sitting in my car on her phone,

13:12.130 --> 13:15.766
giving that same speech
to about 20 different guys.

13:17.035 --> 13:19.803
Maybe we should talk later.

13:21.706 --> 13:22.906
Emily, wait.

13:22.941 --> 13:25.709
No, I don't wanna be late.
We'll talk later.

13:40.125 --> 13:43.498
You must be Amy.

13:43.618 --> 13:45.796
Hi. Are you Maggie?

13:45.830 --> 13:48.866
I am. Did you have
any trouble finding the place?

13:48.900 --> 13:50.968
No, no. It was--
it was fairly easy.

13:51.002 --> 13:53.737
Did you say you were
grad or undergrad?

13:53.772 --> 13:56.006
Undergrad.
Of course.

13:56.040 --> 13:58.008
You look so young.

13:58.042 --> 14:00.844
Well, come in.
Have a seat.

14:02.814 --> 14:04.681
I've been looking for you.
Where have you been?

14:04.716 --> 14:07.017
I had to talk to Nate.

14:07.051 --> 14:08.919
I think I may have led him on,

14:08.953 --> 14:11.088
but I made it clear
that I'm dating Paige.

14:11.122 --> 14:12.923
Why were you looking for me?

14:12.957 --> 14:15.058
Has...

14:15.093 --> 14:18.896
Has Paige ever mentioned
her history with Ali to you?

14:18.930 --> 14:20.063
Her history?

14:20.098 --> 14:22.065
Yeah, they weren't
passing acquaintances, Em.

14:22.100 --> 14:23.700
They were, like, in a war.

14:23.735 --> 14:25.769
Who told you this?
Cece.

14:25.804 --> 14:27.871
No, look, I know that
it sounds weird, okay?

14:27.906 --> 14:30.774
But once she told me Ali's
nickname for Paige, it clicked.

14:30.809 --> 14:32.843
Alison had nicknames for half
the people in this school.

14:32.877 --> 14:34.812
That doesn't really qualify
as having a history.

14:34.846 --> 14:37.748
Okay, I get it, but according
to Cece, this was--

14:37.782 --> 14:39.116
Why are we suddenly
trusting Cece?

14:39.150 --> 14:41.952
Because Ali might have told her
things that she couldn't tell us.

14:41.986 --> 14:43.620
I gotta get to practice.

14:43.655 --> 14:45.622
Emily, look, you and Paige

14:45.657 --> 14:47.958
have been seeing each other
on and off for almost a year,

14:47.992 --> 14:49.793
and you don't think
it's a little odd

14:49.828 --> 14:51.995
that she's never mentioned
anything about Ali to you?

14:52.030 --> 14:54.965
I think what's odd is watching
history repeat itself.

14:54.999 --> 14:57.067
Alison loved pitting us
against one another,

14:57.101 --> 14:58.769
and now Cece swoops in--

14:58.803 --> 14:59.837
This isn't about Cece, okay?

14:59.871 --> 15:01.672
A friend of ours
had an ongoing feud

15:01.706 --> 15:04.808
with someone whom we both know
has a bit of a dark side.

15:04.843 --> 15:05.909
Excuse me?

15:05.944 --> 15:08.579
I'm not accusing her
of anything,

15:08.613 --> 15:11.615
but let's not forget, Emily, this
girl once tried to drown you.

15:11.649 --> 15:12.850
I don't think that
was a love dunk.

15:12.884 --> 15:14.785
There were other issues
going on in her life back then.

15:14.819 --> 15:16.620
Yeah, like being sneaky.

15:16.654 --> 15:18.989
She also got you
kicked off of the swim team.

15:19.023 --> 15:20.691
I'm not calling
her a snake--

15:20.725 --> 15:22.793
Okay, are you finished?
Because I am.

15:31.970 --> 15:35.973
Hey, Jenna, can I talk
to you for a minute?

15:36.007 --> 15:39.042
You know that video
that Ali threatened you with?

15:39.077 --> 15:41.879
The one with you and Toby
in your bedroom?

15:41.913 --> 15:44.615
Why are you dredging this up?

15:44.649 --> 15:46.984
There's a thumb drive
that was found at the church.

15:47.018 --> 15:48.886
Found?

15:48.920 --> 15:49.953
Yes, found.

15:49.988 --> 15:52.656
And they're taking it
to the police.

15:52.690 --> 15:55.058
So I just wanna let you know
that we-- me and my friends--

15:55.093 --> 15:58.629
had nothing to do with it.

15:58.663 --> 15:59.930
Look, I know you hate us, Jenna,

15:59.964 --> 16:02.699
but don't punish us for
something we didn't do, okay?

16:04.869 --> 16:07.604
Are you hearing
anything I'm saying to you?

16:07.639 --> 16:09.673
I never had a problem
with my ears, Hanna.

16:09.707 --> 16:13.944
We're just gonna have to see
how things turn out, won't we?

16:17.916 --> 16:21.785
Hanna!
You got a second?

16:21.819 --> 16:22.953
Have you seen Emily?

16:22.987 --> 16:24.855
She's at swim practice.

16:24.889 --> 16:26.623
I'm kind of lost here.

16:26.658 --> 16:28.926
Emily and I
were in this groove,

16:28.960 --> 16:30.928
and suddenly
she just pink-slipped me.

16:30.962 --> 16:35.565
Um, Nate? She's gay.
She dated your cousin.

16:35.600 --> 16:36.800
Yeah, I get it.

16:36.834 --> 16:39.803
I figured it was about the
person, not the equipment.

16:39.837 --> 16:41.571
Maya was pretty fluid.

16:41.606 --> 16:42.873
Look, I don't know what
Emily said to you,

16:42.907 --> 16:45.876
but she doesn't play games...

16:45.910 --> 16:47.878
Unlike some people.

16:49.647 --> 16:51.615
You got that right.

16:51.649 --> 16:53.050
She's all
up in your face one day,

16:53.084 --> 16:54.785
and the next, she's looking
right through you.

16:54.819 --> 16:55.986
Yeah, well, she perfected that

16:56.020 --> 16:58.021
when she was still
playing Helen Keller.

16:58.056 --> 16:59.022
What do you mean, playing?

16:59.057 --> 17:00.624
Never mind.

17:00.658 --> 17:01.725
No, hold it.

17:01.759 --> 17:03.527
You're telling me
that she was faking?

17:03.561 --> 17:04.928
Being blind?

17:07.865 --> 17:08.965
Hey, Jenna.

17:09.000 --> 17:11.801
Don't pretend
you don't see me, girl.

17:11.836 --> 17:12.970
I know you saw me.

17:23.013 --> 17:25.549
Have you thought about
what grade you'd like to teach?

17:25.583 --> 17:26.782
Uh, first.

17:26.818 --> 17:28.819
I like this age.

17:28.853 --> 17:30.587
It makes me feel taller.

17:34.826 --> 17:36.626
Yeah, I'm just not sure
if I wanna live

17:36.661 --> 17:38.795
in an urban setting
or the suburbs.

17:38.830 --> 17:41.798
You know, being single
and trying to meet people...

17:41.833 --> 17:44.568
You'd be surprised.
I've done fine.

17:44.602 --> 17:47.938
Okay, you guys,
time to clean up.

17:47.972 --> 17:49.973
Transitions can be tricky.

17:50.008 --> 17:52.576
Can I have a play date
with Brian?

17:52.610 --> 17:54.711
Not today, Malcolm.

17:56.614 --> 17:59.850
So sweet. They want your
permission for everything.

17:59.884 --> 18:01.752
Well, it's a special case.

18:01.786 --> 18:03.887
Malcolm also
happens to be my son.

18:06.824 --> 18:09.926
You're doing the math,
aren't you?

18:09.961 --> 18:11.762
Yeah, I was a teen mom

18:11.796 --> 18:13.830
way before it was
a reality show.

18:15.867 --> 18:17.968
Okay, how are we doing?

18:24.484 --> 18:25.978
Arya is not free

18:26.098 --> 18:28.085
and I still have not
heard back from Hanna.

18:28.120 --> 18:29.387
But we have Emily.

18:29.421 --> 18:31.255
Uh, maybe not.

18:31.290 --> 18:35.426
Oh, don't tell me she ditched us for Pigskin.
I need bodies here.

18:35.460 --> 18:39.130
No, I get it. It's just that I might
have approached her in the wrong way.

18:39.164 --> 18:42.066
You brought up Ali's war with
her girlfriend, didn't you?

18:42.100 --> 18:43.467
Bad move, Spencer.

18:43.502 --> 18:46.370
Well, what were
they fighting about?

18:46.405 --> 18:48.372
Emily.

18:50.971 --> 18:53.244
Okay, so I snuck
into Emily's bedroom

18:53.278 --> 18:54.412
and stole some
of her stationery.

18:54.446 --> 18:55.413
Love it!

18:55.447 --> 18:58.249
And I wrote Pigskin
a super steamy note.

18:58.283 --> 18:59.517
Think moist.

18:59.637 --> 19:01.252
Okay, I just threw up
a little in my mouth.

19:01.286 --> 19:03.421
I told her that
I was dating this guy,

19:03.455 --> 19:05.423
but I was having some seriously
hot fantasies about her

19:05.457 --> 19:07.291
and needed to know
if she felt the same way.

19:07.326 --> 19:10.361
Mama's proud, but Emily
is gonna crucify you.

19:10.395 --> 19:12.214
Oh, please, she's clueless.

19:12.334 --> 19:15.099
I told Paige that she
can't email or text me

19:15.133 --> 19:17.001
because my boyfriend's
suspicious.

19:17.035 --> 19:19.467
Does Emily
even have a boyfriend?

19:19.784 --> 19:21.429
Is that her?

19:21.657 --> 19:24.375
That's her! Get down!
You get down.

19:24.409 --> 19:27.044
She doesn't even know me.

19:31.678 --> 19:33.969
What is she doing?

19:34.386 --> 19:36.943
I told her to leave her note
under that sign.

19:46.559 --> 19:48.594
No, no, no, no!

19:48.628 --> 19:50.729
Did you want me
to deliver this to Emily?

19:50.764 --> 19:53.537
I probably should since
I was the one that wrote to you.

19:54.069 --> 19:57.132
Should I open it here or should
I just forward it to daddy?

19:57.252 --> 19:59.539
Is he still that big ol' Deacon
at the church?

19:59.659 --> 20:01.293
Give it to me.

20:01.327 --> 20:03.262
Aw. Why should I?

20:03.296 --> 20:05.430
I'd much rather watch
your daddy blow up

20:05.465 --> 20:06.698
when he finds out
you wanna slip your--

20:06.733 --> 20:08.534
Give it to me!

20:08.568 --> 20:12.337
Think again, Pigskin.
I own you now!

20:19.646 --> 20:22.447
Drive. Drive!

20:27.022 --> 20:28.323
What did she do
with Paige's letter?

20:28.357 --> 20:30.391
Alison?
Probably nothing.

20:30.426 --> 20:34.095
She'd never admit this, but I think
Ali was a little scared of that girl.

20:35.331 --> 20:37.165
Does wool make you itchy?

20:49.345 --> 20:51.012
Paige?

20:57.186 --> 21:00.088
Remember on one
of our first dates,

21:00.122 --> 21:02.290
you mentioned
my liking bold women?

21:02.324 --> 21:06.160
Yes. Why?
Have you changed your mind?

21:06.195 --> 21:08.263
You brought up Ali,

21:08.297 --> 21:12.000
and I was just trying
to remember how you knew her.

21:12.034 --> 21:16.137
I didn't. I knew of her. Why?

21:17.210 --> 21:20.052
It's just that Spencer thought
that maybe you and Ali had a--

21:20.172 --> 21:22.977
Why are your friends talking
about me instead of to me?

21:24.914 --> 21:27.806
Sorry.
Forget I brought it up.

21:32.922 --> 21:37.125
Has it ever occurred to you that maybe it's
your friends you should be questioning?

21:37.159 --> 21:39.961
Don't you think it's strange
that there were four people

21:39.995 --> 21:44.198
drinking at Spencer's that night and
you were the only one who got drugged?

21:44.233 --> 21:46.367
My friends didn't poison me.

21:46.402 --> 21:51.372
Okay, but Mona pretended to be
your friend for like a year,

21:51.407 --> 21:53.341
and she turned out
to be a mutant.

21:53.375 --> 21:55.109
Mona was never my friend.

21:55.144 --> 21:57.045
I trust these girls
with my life.

21:59.281 --> 22:02.884
You're right. You're right.

22:02.918 --> 22:05.320
I just think maybe I need to
spend some more time with them.

22:17.232 --> 22:21.903
Oh, sorry. I, uh...
I didn't mean to scare you.

22:21.937 --> 22:24.205
I just stopped by
to drop that off.

22:24.239 --> 22:26.341
I didn't wanna leave it
at the front door,

22:26.375 --> 22:28.209
so the manager let me in.

22:30.245 --> 22:33.314
You okay?
You still look freaked.

22:33.349 --> 22:35.016
No, I'm fine.

22:37.920 --> 22:40.221
Why did you tell me
that story about Maggie?

22:42.257 --> 22:44.892
Again, I, um...

22:44.927 --> 22:47.095
I just assumed
my brother already had.

22:47.129 --> 22:50.331
I didn't do it
to mess with your head.

22:50.366 --> 22:52.300
What's wrong?

22:54.336 --> 22:57.205
I saw her.

22:57.239 --> 23:00.341
What? Where?

23:00.376 --> 23:03.144
Yeah, I-I took a train
into Wilmington,

23:03.178 --> 23:06.981
and I...
I sat in her classroom.

23:07.016 --> 23:08.216
Why would you do that?

23:08.250 --> 23:11.252
Because Ezra needed to know
that she was okay.

23:11.286 --> 23:13.187
But... she's not?

23:13.222 --> 23:16.090
Oh, no. She's--
she's great...

23:16.125 --> 23:22.230
And a mom of a seven-year-old little
boy that looks a lot like that.

23:27.903 --> 23:29.237
Wait, what are you saying?

23:33.142 --> 23:34.308
Oh, man.

23:36.311 --> 23:39.047
No, maybe she just said that because
she felt threatened by you,

23:39.081 --> 23:40.214
his girlfriend
checking her out.

23:40.249 --> 23:42.950
No, she didn't know who I was.

23:44.253 --> 23:46.988
And why wouldn't she tell him
that he has a son?

23:55.264 --> 23:58.066
Spence, how many boxes
do you have in there?

23:58.100 --> 24:02.103
Two. One says "Shoes,"
the other one says "Belts."

24:02.137 --> 24:05.973
Damn, we're missing one.
I gotta go stop him before he leaves.

24:06.008 --> 24:06.974
Okay.

24:52.121 --> 24:55.189
Cece! Cece, please help me!

24:55.224 --> 24:59.994
Cece! Cece, please!
Somebody help me!

25:00.028 --> 25:01.929
Cece!

25:06.034 --> 25:08.002
Yeah, we're missing a box.

25:08.036 --> 25:09.237
Cece!

25:15.010 --> 25:16.010
Stop it!

25:24.536 --> 25:28.314
It was alive? Was it crawling?
Was there a text from "A"?

25:28.886 --> 25:30.441
Jenna knew that you
would ask me to help.

25:30.561 --> 25:32.023
Okay, get off
of the blind girl train.

25:32.143 --> 25:34.922
I am telling you that I
actually used the word "snake"

25:35.045 --> 25:37.079
when I was talking to Emily outside
of the girls' locker room.

25:37.114 --> 25:40.249
Paige is not after us. She's in
love with one of our best friends.

25:40.284 --> 25:42.885
Okay, but she was
with Emily that night,

25:42.920 --> 25:45.254
and she never said a word
until Emily brought it up.

25:45.289 --> 25:47.089
Maybe instead of
hooking up with Emily,

25:47.124 --> 25:49.091
she was hauling her off
to an open grave.

25:49.126 --> 25:51.861
- Spencer... - No, we really need to review
that security tape because

25:51.895 --> 25:53.863
I guarantee you anything
that was a girl's shadow

25:53.897 --> 25:55.264
that grabbed Maya
outside of Noel's cabin.

25:55.299 --> 25:57.166
And you think
this was Paige/Pigskin?

25:57.201 --> 25:59.902
Yeah, don't you?

25:59.937 --> 26:01.904
She's been obsessed
with Emily for years.

26:01.939 --> 26:04.941
She was jealous of Ali.
She was jealous of Maya.

26:04.975 --> 26:06.175
She hated them.
She probably hates us.

26:06.210 --> 26:07.843
Who is that? Is that Wren?

26:07.878 --> 26:10.012
It's Emily.

26:10.047 --> 26:11.948
Well, give me it!
We don't know what we're gonna say to her!

26:11.982 --> 26:13.115
I'm going to say "Hi."

26:13.150 --> 26:15.084
Look, it's about the knife
in Maya's bag.

26:15.118 --> 26:19.021
Hi. Please tell me
it's not rusty.

26:19.056 --> 26:21.958
It's not here. We must've lost it
when we were racing to the car.

26:21.992 --> 26:24.894
No, we didn't lose it, we put it in the bag.
Where is the bag?

26:24.928 --> 26:25.995
It was under my bed.

26:26.029 --> 26:27.230
<i>Someone must've</i>
<i>broken into your house.</i>

26:27.264 --> 26:29.098
Then why wouldn't they
take the whole bag?

26:29.132 --> 26:31.100
<i>We must've dropped it</i>
<i>outside of Noel's cabin.</i>

26:31.134 --> 26:34.103
No, the only thing we dropped,
Emily, was a pound of my flesh!

26:34.137 --> 26:35.204
Now, did you check your car?

26:35.239 --> 26:38.140
Yes, but I'll check again.

26:38.175 --> 26:42.144
There's no way we left it
outside of Noel's cabin.

26:42.179 --> 26:44.046
"A" must've snuck
into her house.

26:44.081 --> 26:46.782
"A" may also go by
the name "Paige."

26:46.817 --> 26:48.818
Why would you sneak in
when you're invited?

26:57.928 --> 27:01.197
How am I not supposed to mention
this over an entire weekend?

27:01.231 --> 27:03.032
Aria, you don't have
to bring it up right away.

27:03.066 --> 27:06.135
The longer I wait,
the bigger the lie.

27:10.907 --> 27:12.942
Well, maybe I could tell him.

27:12.976 --> 27:14.877
I could say I was the one
who went to Wilmington.

27:14.911 --> 27:18.848
Right, and when Maggie describes
you as a petite coed named Amy?

27:18.882 --> 27:21.851
Yeah, it's gotta be you.

27:21.885 --> 27:25.221
But I could be there
for moral support.

27:33.030 --> 27:36.832
Hey, listen to me.

27:36.867 --> 27:39.835
This doesn't change anything
between you and Ezra.

27:39.870 --> 27:41.103
How do you know that?

27:41.138 --> 27:45.741
You and I were learning fractions
when this kid was born.

27:45.776 --> 27:49.211
And I've never had to deal
with anything like this before.

27:56.253 --> 27:58.087
He's on his way.

28:02.092 --> 28:06.962
I figure the rack can be in the back, and
you can change in the dressing rooms.

28:06.997 --> 28:08.731
Yeah, no, thank you.

28:08.765 --> 28:10.833
Guys, animal control
has already been here.

28:10.867 --> 28:13.002
I swear. They took it away
and went through

28:13.036 --> 28:15.771
all the other boxes for nests.
Nests?

28:15.806 --> 28:17.773
Hanna, you could rock this.

28:17.808 --> 28:20.009
Be even better if you
pinned your hair up, though.

28:20.043 --> 28:23.779
Oh, yeah.
No, my hair is just...It doesn't...

28:23.814 --> 28:26.082
Use the dry shampoo.

28:26.116 --> 28:29.785
You're not the only one that didn't have a
chance to wash your hair this morning, hon.

28:29.820 --> 28:34.156
This length, those legs--
perfect.

28:34.191 --> 28:36.125
Uh, you probably should
actually give that to Emily.

28:36.159 --> 28:38.194
Emily's coming?
Fabulous.

28:41.832 --> 28:43.699
Look, I got her to come here.
I don't know if she'll stay.

28:43.734 --> 28:44.967
Well, you don't have
to bring up Paige right away.

28:45.001 --> 28:46.702
Just check
her temperature first.

28:46.737 --> 28:49.805
Spencer, you should wear this.
It's so you.

28:49.840 --> 28:53.109
No, you know what?
That is so me. Thank you.

29:20.804 --> 29:23.706
Hey. Shh.

29:23.740 --> 29:25.708
What are you doing here?

29:25.742 --> 29:27.042
I talked to your mom.

29:27.077 --> 29:28.711
You did?
Yeah.

29:28.745 --> 29:29.879
What'd you say?

29:29.913 --> 29:32.114
Well, I told her that if she
handed over those videos,

29:32.149 --> 29:36.886
Wilden and his cronies would be watching
you change into a bikini on a loop.

29:36.920 --> 29:38.888
Kinda kicked in
her maternal instincts.

29:38.922 --> 29:40.723
So she's not
gonna turn them in?

29:40.757 --> 29:41.957
I don't know.

29:41.992 --> 29:45.127
But I also reminded her
that one of rosewood's finest

29:45.162 --> 29:48.964
is about to go on trial for the
murder of two of your friends.

29:48.999 --> 29:52.134
Thank you. Caleb,
you didn't have to do that.

29:52.169 --> 29:54.970
Yeah, I did.

29:55.005 --> 29:58.974
I don't know how much longer
I can do this, Hanna.

29:59.009 --> 30:00.943
I need to touch you.

30:10.153 --> 30:14.824
Hanna, I have some shoes out here for you.
How's that dress look?

30:16.760 --> 30:17.993
Hot.

30:22.966 --> 30:24.934
So how are you
gonna sneak out of here?

30:24.968 --> 30:26.936
Same way I came in.

30:26.970 --> 30:30.940
Why? Is Jenna
coming to this thing?

30:30.974 --> 30:36.212
I don't think Jenna's the one
we have to be afraid of anymore.

30:39.249 --> 30:40.950
Hello.

30:40.984 --> 30:42.218
Hi.

30:42.252 --> 30:46.222
The birthday boy--
man-- whatever.

30:46.256 --> 30:50.960
Wes dropped off a gift for you, so
I invited him to stay for dinner.

30:50.994 --> 30:52.862
Yeah, hope that's cool.

30:52.896 --> 30:58.133
No, glad you're here.
The more the merrier.

30:58.168 --> 30:59.969
So now you wanna celebrate?

31:00.003 --> 31:01.722
I sorta do.

31:03.907 --> 31:05.074
I called Maggie.

31:07.043 --> 31:09.111
And she's doing great.

31:09.145 --> 31:12.114
What does that mean?

31:12.148 --> 31:15.718
She got a masters in education,
she has a good job,

31:15.752 --> 31:17.786
owns her own home,
lives by herself,

31:17.821 --> 31:20.789
and she's really happy.

31:20.824 --> 31:22.157
She told you that?

31:22.192 --> 31:25.794
We didn't talk more than five minutes,
but honestly, that was enough.

31:25.829 --> 31:28.571
I'm incredibly relieved.

31:30.166 --> 31:32.801
I'm gonna take a shower
and then we can celebrate.

31:50.957 --> 31:52.958
Look who's here!

31:52.992 --> 31:56.962
I have such
the fiercest outfit for you!

31:56.996 --> 31:58.063
Hi, Em.

31:58.097 --> 31:59.898
Hello.

31:59.932 --> 32:02.234
I hope you don't mind.
I brought a guest.

32:03.936 --> 32:05.771
Hey, Spencer.

32:05.805 --> 32:07.773
Hello.

32:07.807 --> 32:11.109
Let's try this on you.

32:13.846 --> 32:14.913
Can I help?

32:16.716 --> 32:17.716
Sure.

32:22.922 --> 32:24.790
What are we doing?

32:24.824 --> 32:27.826
Rings on these
and bracelets on that.

32:31.130 --> 32:33.932
This is nice.

32:33.966 --> 32:37.736
Not that I could
ever pull it off.

32:37.770 --> 32:41.106
I put on something like this and it looks
like I'm trying to be somebody I'm not.

32:41.140 --> 32:45.210
Well, you have your own style.

32:45.244 --> 32:48.880
More by default.
I don't do flashy.

32:48.915 --> 32:53.051
I feel better under the radar.

33:02.061 --> 33:05.764
Being with Emily has made me
feel much more confident.

33:07.934 --> 33:10.969
I know you guys still have
your reservations about me.

33:11.003 --> 33:12.137
Did Emily tell you that?

33:12.171 --> 33:14.005
Didn't have to.

33:14.040 --> 33:17.909
We both know I've acted out
and done stuff I regretted.

33:20.012 --> 33:22.914
But I'd really like it,
Spencer,

33:22.949 --> 33:24.950
if we could make a fresh start.

33:27.753 --> 33:29.087
Oh. Oops.

33:34.794 --> 33:37.929
Happy birthday!
Happy birthday.

33:37.964 --> 33:39.164
Did you even make a wish?

33:39.198 --> 33:40.899
I don't need to.

33:40.933 --> 33:43.034
Everything I want
I've already got.

33:48.174 --> 33:50.041
I'll cut the cake.

33:52.144 --> 33:55.146
Dude, you are getting old.
What are we listening to?

33:55.181 --> 33:57.983
Hootie and the Blowfish?

34:00.987 --> 34:02.854
I think I know why
she lied to him.

34:08.828 --> 34:10.862
What if my mom
is paying her to keep quiet?

34:10.897 --> 34:12.130
You think that your mom knows?

34:12.164 --> 34:15.000
She might.

34:15.034 --> 34:16.701
How do you guys feel
about supertramp?

34:16.735 --> 34:17.768
Who?

34:17.803 --> 34:19.704
That's what I thought.

34:19.739 --> 34:22.040
You need to talk
to your mom then.

34:22.074 --> 34:24.009
And say what?
I don't know.

34:24.043 --> 34:26.177
But if you're right
and we say something now,

34:26.212 --> 34:27.913
then Maggie might get punished

34:27.947 --> 34:30.815
and that little boy
gets cut off.

34:34.820 --> 34:36.788
I'm sorry. I thought
Emily was coming alone.

34:36.822 --> 34:39.123
Ye, well, her plus one
suddenly wants to be our BFF.

34:39.158 --> 34:43.995
She's trying to kill us with kindness
before she actually just... kills us.

34:50.835 --> 34:54.172
Do we think that
the knife is in that bag?

35:05.051 --> 35:07.852
Hey, Paige?

35:07.887 --> 35:10.956
Um, can you give this to
Emily and help her out?

35:10.990 --> 35:12.691
It's kind of
a two-woman operation.

35:12.725 --> 35:15.026
Yeah.
Cool.

35:34.814 --> 35:35.880
What are you doing?

35:40.119 --> 35:41.720
We're leaving.

35:41.754 --> 35:42.821
Emily...

35:42.855 --> 35:44.856
No, don't be so forgiving.

35:44.890 --> 35:46.791
I'm changing
and then we're out of here.

35:53.899 --> 35:55.000
Great.

35:55.034 --> 35:57.836
Now she really hates us
and Emily hates us even more.

35:57.870 --> 36:00.707
Emily will get over it.
We needed proof.

36:00.827 --> 36:02.107
And we got it.

36:15.474 --> 36:16.990
Do you wanna sit inside?

36:17.110 --> 36:18.711
No, this is good.

36:18.745 --> 36:21.308
Thanks.

36:24.584 --> 36:26.096
We should never have gone--

36:26.216 --> 36:29.555
It was my idea. I made you go.

36:29.589 --> 36:32.491
I don't even know
how to apologize for them.

36:32.525 --> 36:34.326
I just feel like
Cece started this whole--

36:34.360 --> 36:35.694
It started with Alison.

36:39.365 --> 36:41.567
She was more than someone
I knew in passing.

36:43.570 --> 36:46.638
I knew her well enough
to hate her guts.

36:48.319 --> 36:50.661
She spent most of ninth grade torturing me.

36:51.478 --> 36:53.712
At first, it was just teasing.

36:53.747 --> 36:57.282
I got through it.
I pushed back.

36:57.317 --> 37:00.652
If she wanted to play dirty,
then so could I.

37:04.290 --> 37:05.491
But...

37:07.294 --> 37:10.192
I had no idea
what I was up against.

37:14.367 --> 37:17.469
She was relentless.

37:24.544 --> 37:27.513
I had nobody to turn to.

37:27.547 --> 37:31.483
I was completely alone.

37:35.578 --> 37:40.046
Finally, it didn't matter
what Alison could do to me,

37:40.350 --> 37:46.431
because... I was willing
to do much worse to myself.

37:49.602 --> 37:53.572
And then I thought...

37:53.606 --> 37:57.409
If I disappeared forever...

37:57.443 --> 38:00.746
She would win.

38:00.780 --> 38:04.550
And I wouldn't let her win.

38:04.584 --> 38:07.586
I couldn't.

38:23.369 --> 38:26.572
Hi.

38:26.606 --> 38:27.706
Hi.

38:29.576 --> 38:30.742
Did you watch it?

38:36.683 --> 38:38.450
I did.

38:41.688 --> 38:43.355
And?

38:44.624 --> 38:46.425
I'm gonna take care of it.

38:46.459 --> 38:51.396
Look, mom, if you just give me
a chance to explain, then...

39:02.675 --> 39:04.309
Thank you.

39:04.344 --> 39:09.348
I didn't do that just for you.
I did it for me.

39:09.382 --> 39:13.518
Apparently, Mona liked
to spy on grown-ups, too.

39:13.553 --> 39:16.421
She recorded a moment of me
and detective Wilden.

39:17.590 --> 39:19.224
One night, he drove me home

39:19.259 --> 39:20.592
after I'd had
too much to drink.

39:20.627 --> 39:21.693
Yeah, I remember.

39:21.728 --> 39:24.296
No, you only
remember some of it.

39:24.330 --> 39:26.365
And now I might have a future

39:26.399 --> 39:29.368
with somebody that
I really, really care about,

39:29.402 --> 39:31.737
and I just wanna
forget all of it.

39:43.616 --> 39:45.484
Hi, come on in.

39:45.518 --> 39:46.618
Howdy.

39:49.289 --> 39:50.355
You look great.

39:51.691 --> 39:54.393
You're smiling.
That's a good sign.

39:54.427 --> 39:55.727
I was worried
those videos might of--

39:55.762 --> 39:57.362
Oh, no. Um...

39:57.397 --> 39:59.531
I watched them
and I'm pretty sure

39:59.565 --> 40:01.500
it was the work of that bully
I was telling you about.

40:01.534 --> 40:02.701
Glad it's history.

40:02.735 --> 40:05.370
I still think we'd better
drop it off at the police.

40:05.405 --> 40:07.472
Right.

40:07.507 --> 40:09.541
The thing is, Ted,

40:09.575 --> 40:12.544
I'm not gonna be able to
give it back to you because...

40:12.578 --> 40:14.346
I destroyed it.

40:15.782 --> 40:19.518
I'm' sorry.
I just...

40:19.552 --> 40:20.752
I didn't want anyone to see it.

40:20.787 --> 40:23.789
So...
I got rid of it.

40:28.361 --> 40:30.495
I see.

40:32.398 --> 40:34.533
Well, I guess that's that.

40:34.567 --> 40:36.702
Shall we?
Yeah.

40:47.447 --> 40:48.680
Did "A" send this to you?

40:48.715 --> 40:51.450
No, I took it
out of Paige's bag.

40:51.484 --> 40:52.617
Why would Paige have it?

40:52.652 --> 40:55.587
Because I'm betting
she dug it out of Ali's grave.

40:55.621 --> 40:57.489
What are you saying?

40:57.523 --> 40:59.491
I'm saying, she probably
has Ali's bones, too.

40:59.525 --> 41:02.461
She may be "A," Aria.

41:02.495 --> 41:05.564
The only question is,
how are we gonna tell Emily?

41:09.402 --> 41:10.635
More tea?

41:10.670 --> 41:13.305
No, I'm good.

41:13.339 --> 41:14.740
I'm gonna go wash my face.

41:41.701 --> 41:42.701
Jenna?

41:43.770 --> 41:46.538
I need to talk to you
about your friend.

41:46.572 --> 41:49.374
What's going on?

41:50.610 --> 41:53.812
Oh. I thought you were alone.

41:54.847 --> 41:57.549
Why? What's the matter?

41:57.583 --> 41:59.818
Jenna, what did you
come here to tell me?

41:59.852 --> 42:03.555
Be very careful who you
spend time with, Emily.

42:03.589 --> 42:06.026
Very careful.

43:34.258 --> 43:45.229
