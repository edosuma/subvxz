00:02.370 --> 00:06.693
***

00:06.740 --> 00:08.799
- So I was thinking
this weekend,

00:08.840 --> 00:11.434
we go to Zippieri's for
dinner and then go hit that

00:11.470 --> 00:13.779
new indoor free-fall
skydiving place.

00:13.810 --> 00:16.643
I'd love to see how you'd deal
with all that flipping around

00:16.680 --> 00:18.705
after a fresh plate of
spaghetti Bolognese, old man.

00:20.550 --> 00:23.314
OK, her I understand, but you?

00:23.350 --> 00:25.341
- It's a brand new world, kid.

00:25.390 --> 00:27.654
I'm actually dating from
the privacy of my own home.

00:27.690 --> 00:30.454
- Wow. I'm in free fall already.

00:30.490 --> 00:34.221
- It's called December Date,
and it's for people of
a particular vintage.

00:34.260 --> 00:36.421
- You're not virtual
dating too, are you?

00:36.470 --> 00:39.462
- My generation doesn't date.
- I like the sounds of that.

00:39.500 --> 00:41.536
- We hang out independently
in groups of guys and girls.

00:41.570 --> 00:43.606
And then, through the
magic of social media,

00:43.640 --> 00:45.608
we "accidentally"
meet up in packs.

00:45.640 --> 00:47.699
- Let's go, kiddo.

00:50.250 --> 00:52.218
- Bye, Dad.
- Have a good day, honey.

00:52.250 --> 00:55.413
Hey. On my estimation,
it's been about a half century

00:55.450 --> 00:57.418
since you went on
a first date with Mom.

00:57.450 --> 01:00.510
So word to the wise, Dad:
slow and steady wins the race.

01:00.560 --> 01:02.824
- Yeah.

01:02.860 --> 01:05.579
Let's hope.

01:05.630 --> 01:10.090
***

01:10.130 --> 01:12.394
- My Dad's on a dating website,
Jules is running

01:12.440 --> 01:14.761
with a teen wolf pack. Did
spring come early this year?

01:14.800 --> 01:18.099
- It's a lonely world out there.
Everyone wants a cuddle buddy.

01:18.140 --> 01:20.176
- I guess you've
got that covered,

01:20.210 --> 01:23.577
Miss Say-it-With-Leather 2016.
How is your mystery man, anyway?

01:23.610 --> 01:26.613
- Have you figured out why
you're so obsessed with
who's dating whom?

01:26.650 --> 01:29.210
- I get the sense
you're about to tell me.

01:32.560 --> 01:35.552
- Nothing like laughter to
brighten my day. Thank you.

01:35.590 --> 01:38.252
- Happens to everyone
now and then, you know.

01:38.290 --> 01:42.124
How long has it been? What's
a dry spell for Matt Shade?

01:42.170 --> 01:44.422
- Can we keep the investigation
focused on our client?

01:44.470 --> 01:46.335
- She's not just a client;
Vanessa's a friend.

01:46.370 --> 01:49.567
- Yeah, I know. I looked her up.
Big-time architect.
Very impressive.

01:49.610 --> 01:51.430
- She's completely
a self-made woman.

01:51.470 --> 01:53.404
I helped with her
divorce case last year.

01:53.440 --> 01:55.431
Found proof her husband
was cheating on her.

01:55.480 --> 01:57.846
- That's what's strange.

01:57.880 --> 02:00.417
She didn't sound like
herself at all on the phone.

02:00.450 --> 02:03.419
All she would say
was to come quickly.

02:03.450 --> 02:06.487
- I'll call the police and
have you charged with theft!

02:06.520 --> 02:09.489
Please, stop it. OK,
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

02:09.530 --> 02:11.486
Look, there's been a mistake.
Let me make some calls

02:11.530 --> 02:13.498
and get this
straightened out. Please!

02:13.530 --> 02:16.328
You can't just take it!
Please, my God.

02:16.370 --> 02:18.793
- They stole it.

02:18.830 --> 02:21.537
They stole my whole life.

02:25.310 --> 02:28.438
- Apparently it was a two-
phase plan. They got a hold

02:28.480 --> 02:31.347
of my passwords somehow and
set up phantom credit cards

02:31.380 --> 02:34.349
in my name. Made
a few small purchases

02:34.380 --> 02:36.348
to see if I'd catch on.
- You didn't.

02:36.390 --> 02:39.211
- No. Once they learned
they were in the clear,

02:39.260 --> 02:41.410
they set up multiple lines
of credit against my house

02:41.460 --> 02:45.328
and made huge withdrawals.
That's when the bank called.

02:45.360 --> 02:47.521
- Aren't the_ banks insured
against things like this?

02:47.560 --> 02:49.528
- That's only if your
credit cards are stolen.

02:49.570 --> 02:51.390
The thieves stole my passwords.

02:51.430 --> 02:53.466
- So the banks can't prove you
didn't do it all yourself.

02:53.500 --> 02:56.606
- No. They're saying I'm on
the hook for seven figures.

02:56.640 --> 02:59.632
What am I gonna do?
- Everything's going to be OK.

02:59.680 --> 03:02.808
Trust me,
I've been there before.

03:02.850 --> 03:05.205
My ex-manager cleaned me out.

03:07.620 --> 03:09.588
- They say they don't
have the resources

03:09.620 --> 03:11.815
for this kind of crime. They did
tell me that most of the money

03:11.850 --> 03:13.818
was used to purchase rare coins.

03:13.860 --> 03:15.987
- That's a hell of a way
to pad your coin collection.

03:16.020 --> 03:19.456
- The thief flew to Miami,
New York, Colorado to buy them.

03:19.500 --> 03:22.469
First class.
- I've seen it before.

03:22.500 --> 03:24.695
The biggest obstacle that
scammers face is converting

03:24.730 --> 03:27.563
credit to cash, so they buy
high-value items to resell.

03:27.600 --> 03:30.330
Coins don't attract attention.
- You toss a million dollar coin

03:30.370 --> 03:32.577
in the tray at airport security
and nobody looks twice.

03:32.610 --> 03:36.341
Anything changed there?

03:36.380 --> 03:38.974
- I work 80 hours a week.
There's no room for change.

03:39.010 --> 03:40.443
- Anyone new in
your life recently?

03:40.480 --> 03:43.813
- You know how it is, Angie.
Running your own business,
there's no time.

03:43.850 --> 03:45.715
- We're going to find out
who did this. OK?

03:45.750 --> 03:48.787
- Thank you. Just
excuse me for a sec.

03:52.960 --> 03:55.451
- I've worked high-level
identity theft cases before.

03:55.500 --> 03:57.491
It's brutal.
- You mentioned an ex-husband.

03:57.530 --> 03:59.998
You think this is personal?
- Let's start with him,

04:00.040 --> 04:02.338
check for proof
of lavish spending lately.

04:02.370 --> 04:04.509
- Follow the money trail.
- And hope.

04:07.810 --> 04:11.576
- ** I see you and you see me

04:11.610 --> 04:15.740
* Watch you blowin' the lines
when you're making a scene *

04:15.780 --> 04:19.352
* Oh boy, you've got to know

04:19.390 --> 04:21.483
* What my head overlooks

04:21.520 --> 04:24.956
* The senses will show
to my heart *

04:24.990 --> 04:27.754
* When it's watching for lies

04:27.800 --> 04:30.291
* 'Cause you can't escape my

04:30.330 --> 04:31.763
* Private Eyes

04:31.800 --> 04:34.394
* They're watching you

04:34.440 --> 04:36.829
* Private Eyes

04:36.870 --> 04:38.861
* They're watching you,
watching you, watching you *

04:38.910 --> 04:41.333
* Watching you *

04:45.910 --> 04:49.516
- So why am I the one going
through her ex

04:49.550 --> 04:51.518
- Your first dumpster dive!
It's a time-honoured tradition.

04:51.550 --> 04:54.656
- Trust me. Everyone throws out

04:54.690 --> 04:57.659
their secrets with the trash.
- There's two dozen units

04:57.690 --> 04:59.658
in this building. We're never
going to find anything.

04:59.700 --> 05:01.725
Oh, it's disgusting!

05:01.760 --> 05:04.490
- OK, well, you can
get out now, anyway.

05:06.700 --> 05:09.407
- Yeah. I found this in
the third bag you threw over.

05:09.440 --> 05:11.408
- I wanted to be

05:11.440 --> 05:13.908
absolutely sure.

05:13.940 --> 05:17.603
- It's a car detailing receipt

05:17.650 --> 05:20.414
made out to a Dean Barnwell.

05:20.450 --> 05:22.543
2016 Porsche Panamera.

05:26.150 --> 05:29.051
- Oh, my God, it's him.

05:29.090 --> 05:31.024
We need to hide! If he sees me,
he'll get suspicious.

05:31.060 --> 05:33.028
- He doesn't know me.

05:33.060 --> 05:35.893
Karma is a fickle mistress.

05:35.930 --> 05:39.366
- Shut up and give me a boost.

05:39.400 --> 05:41.595
- Watch out for the--
- Ew!

05:54.080 --> 05:56.640
- You know, the raccoons

05:56.690 --> 05:59.511
get bigger every year. You might
wanna get a new parking spot.

05:59.560 --> 06:03.451
Hey, that's a sweet ride. You
get a chance to open her up yet?

06:03.490 --> 06:06.721
- Uh, its top speed's 285,
but I chicken out around 240.

06:06.760 --> 06:10.469
- Yeah, I got a'69 911T myself.
My ex-wife would freak out

06:10.500 --> 06:12.468
if she ever caught me
in anything like this.

06:12.500 --> 06:15.469
- Luckily mine doesn't know.

06:15.500 --> 06:17.730
My ex was all over me.
Even hired a private detective

06:17.770 --> 06:19.738
to follow me around.
- Mine too.

06:19.780 --> 06:23.443
And like a dumbass, she caught
me cheating. Ruined my life.

06:23.480 --> 06:25.948
- Wow. Well, things
can't be that bad.

06:25.980 --> 06:29.586
- I lease it. I can barely
keep up the payments.

06:29.620 --> 06:31.542
Well, see you.

06:31.590 --> 06:33.455
- Do you ever think about
trying to get back together

06:33.490 --> 06:35.515
with her

06:35.560 --> 06:38.120
- Sure, but she's back
out there already.

06:38.160 --> 06:41.596
She's apparently been dating
again, with a vengeance.

06:41.630 --> 06:44.997
Wasted no time. Take it easy.

06:45.030 --> 06:47.567
- Hey, you too.

06:53.580 --> 06:55.605
There's nothing in your
ex-husband's financial records

06:55.640 --> 06:58.040
that indicates he had
anything to do with this.

06:58.080 --> 07:00.719
In fact, he's pretty much broke.

07:00.750 --> 07:03.947
- He did say you were seeing
people again. Is that true?

07:03.990 --> 07:06.788
- About a thousand creditors.

07:06.820 --> 07:08.913
- I wish.

07:08.960 --> 07:11.053
A friend and I did go

07:11.090 --> 07:13.456
on a speed-dating event
about four months ago.

07:13.500 --> 07:15.092
- The company was called

07:15.130 --> 07:17.496
Constellations. I'm sorry,
I totally forgot.

07:17.530 --> 07:19.760
But I didn't go out
on any dates after that.

07:19.800 --> 07:22.030
- Speed-dating still works the
way I think it does, right?

07:22.070 --> 07:23.958
A bunch of guys
sit across from you

07:24.010 --> 07:26.160
for a couple of minutes each?
- Ask you as many personal

07:26.210 --> 07:28.838
questions as they can,
as fast as they can?

07:28.880 --> 07:32.543
- Oh, my God. You think
I set myself up?

07:32.580 --> 07:36.482
- Just give us a ballpark. How
many guys are we talking about?

07:36.520 --> 07:39.489
- Welcome to Constellations.

07:39.520 --> 07:41.488
My name is Enrique Villanova.

07:41.520 --> 07:44.250
I want to congratulate you
on making the first step

07:44.290 --> 07:46.599
toward a happier,
more fulfilled life.

07:49.230 --> 07:51.767
- Well, Vanessa picked
a popular dating company.

07:51.800 --> 07:54.268
- So a lot of guys then.

07:54.300 --> 07:56.564
- If our thief is swimming
in these waters...

07:56.610 --> 07:58.862
I think we're diving in.

08:03.580 --> 08:06.515
So how honest should we be on
this speed

08:06.550 --> 08:08.541
- Honest-ish.
- It's kinda genius,

08:08.580 --> 08:10.946
using speed-dating. You grill
someone for two minutes,

08:10.990 --> 08:13.208
it comes off as interest.
- Meanwhile, you're learning

08:13.260 --> 08:16.013
all the common passwords:
first pet, favourite movie,

08:16.060 --> 08:18.255
even mother's maiden name.
- What are you putting down

08:18.290 --> 08:19.894
as a profession?
- Urban planner.

08:19.930 --> 08:23.696
It's close to architect. I'm
trying to emulate Vanessa's
profile as much as possible.

08:23.730 --> 08:25.766
- Smart.

08:25.800 --> 08:27.836
- Owner of a sports
memorabilia company.

08:27.870 --> 08:29.701
- Not the sexiest...

08:29.740 --> 08:32.538
- Hey, I could put down pet food
taster and I'd still be catnip.

08:32.580 --> 08:35.708
- So you are using
this to break your slump.
- Nothing here to break, sister.

08:35.740 --> 08:38.277
And I'm starting to wonder if
that "stride of pride" of yours

08:38.310 --> 08:42.178
was all front.
- Oh... You still frustrated
that you don't know who It Is?

08:42.220 --> 08:44.313
- People in slumps
are frustrated. Ergo,

08:44.350 --> 08:47.183
I'm not frustrated at all.
- OK.

08:47.220 --> 08:49.256
- Favourite music...

08:49.290 --> 08:51.258
- Remember, this is
a vulnerable step for people.

08:51.290 --> 08:53.850
So I'd go with something
empathetic, like...

08:53.900 --> 08:55.856
Sarah McLachlan.

08:55.900 --> 08:59.028
: Sarah McLachlan...

09:09.380 --> 09:11.302
Hey, honey!

09:11.350 --> 09:14.319
- I've got to get dressed. I got
a date tonight with 20 women.

09:16.990 --> 09:19.185
OK.

09:19.220 --> 09:22.929
What's going on? I just teed
one up for you. You let it go.

09:22.960 --> 09:26.282
- I was wrong.
- Wow, that's a first.

09:26.330 --> 09:28.821
- Apparently, my generation
does go on dates.

09:28.860 --> 09:32.637
Liam just asked me out.
- On a date.

09:32.670 --> 09:35.036
- I don't even know what "on
a date" means. Do I have to act

09:35.070 --> 09:37.038
differently? Do I have to
worry about what I'm wearing?

09:37.070 --> 09:39.061
- I'm sure I'll worry
enough for the both of us.

09:39.110 --> 09:41.169
Where's this date happening?
- He wants to take me

09:41.210 --> 09:43.371
to Symphony Star Trek
at the planetarium.

09:43.410 --> 09:46.345
- No, no.
The planetarium is out.

09:46.380 --> 09:49.269
Planetariums are for making out.
No one looks at the stars!

09:49.320 --> 09:52.118
- Well, not looking is a given.
We're going for the music.

09:52.150 --> 09:55.085
- No. Honey, this is moving
way too fast for me.

09:55.120 --> 09:57.884
- You know, Dad, I could have
used some real advice here.

09:57.930 --> 10:01.252
But I'm glad we got your
feelings on the subject
straightened out.

10:01.300 --> 10:03.689
- Honey, honey, honey.
Look, I'm sorry.

10:03.730 --> 10:07.769
It's just... I'm used to being
the Liam in this situation.

10:07.800 --> 10:11.099
When is this date happening?

10:11.140 --> 10:13.176
- You can't tail us!

10:15.280 --> 10:20.115
***

10:20.150 --> 10:22.710
- How can we guarantee the
thiefs going to be here?

10:22.750 --> 10:25.218
- We can't, but it's the only
speed-dating event this month.

10:25.250 --> 10:27.309
Ooh, I'll take one of those.

10:27.360 --> 10:30.329
- It may be speed-dating, but
they know how to do it up right.

10:30.360 --> 10:32.999
- Yep.

10:33.030 --> 10:36.193
- Did you pick up that eating
technique at finishing school?

10:36.230 --> 10:38.198
- I missed dinner.

10:38.230 --> 10:41.358
Is there something on my face?

10:44.410 --> 10:47.208
- Ladies and gentlemen, welcome.

10:47.240 --> 10:50.698
Before you take your seats,
let's review the rules.

10:50.750 --> 10:54.015
You'll have_ two minutes
to connect With each person

10:54.050 --> 10:56.143
before the bell rings
and you move on.

10:56.180 --> 10:58.182
- I'm gonna trick our thief

10:58.220 --> 11:00.882
into overplaying his hand.
- How will you know

11:00.920 --> 11:02.888
when someone's a suspect?
- Identity thieves,

11:02.930 --> 11:05.251
they feed on the minutia
of your life and schedule.

11:05.290 --> 11:08.020
If someone's overly interested
in my personal trivia,

11:08.060 --> 11:10.290
I'll get a second
date request from them.

11:10.330 --> 11:13.333
- Candy from a baby.

11:13.370 --> 11:16.066
- ...you can "ping" anyone
you wish via our app.

11:16.100 --> 11:19.831
The ping comes with our patented
emoji, requesting a date.

11:19.880 --> 11:22.906
My advice to you all: be open,

11:22.950 --> 11:25.043
and love will find you.

11:25.080 --> 11:27.310
Now please take your seats.

11:27.350 --> 11:29.841
- Meanwhile, I'm looking for
victims of identity theft.

11:29.890 --> 11:32.188
Meaning I have to find
a way to ask these ladies

11:32.220 --> 11:34.188
about their financial history
without looking like a creep.

11:34.220 --> 11:38.259
- Which should be a cinch.
Unless you're in a slump?

11:40.230 --> 11:42.289
- 20 bucks says I get more
dates off of this than you.

11:42.330 --> 11:45.458
- I don't want your money.
- Done.

11:49.040 --> 11:52.009
***

11:52.040 --> 11:55.339
- Ladies and gentlemen,
time to get speed-dating!

11:55.380 --> 11:57.905
Instead of
leading with our strengths,

11:57.950 --> 12:00.976
we could do something
completely crazy.

12:03.450 --> 12:07.181
- Or we could talk about the
worst thing that's ever
happened to us.

12:07.220 --> 12:10.018
I'll go first. My manager
stole all my money.

12:10.060 --> 12:12.381
- Every last dime.

12:14.230 --> 12:16.357
I'd love to help with it,

12:16.400 --> 12:19.426
or with anything at all.
- I'm debating taking my company

12:19.470 --> 12:22.462
public, but I'm not sure I want
the oversight. Call me crazy--

12:22.500 --> 12:24.468
- You're crazy.

12:24.510 --> 12:26.466
I mean, you asked me to call you
that, right? I don't actually

12:26.510 --> 12:28.876
mean you're crazy.
I think you're amazing.

12:28.910 --> 12:32.846
I'm blowing this. I am blowing
this, aren't I? Oh, crap.

12:32.880 --> 12:34.916
Your turn.
- OK.

12:34.950 --> 12:37.783
My dad shot my dog.
- That's terrible.

12:37.820 --> 12:40.288
- For eating his hoagie.

12:40.320 --> 12:42.959
: Bang.

12:42.990 --> 12:46.221
Ping me?

12:46.260 --> 12:48.228
- How much money
did your manager take?

12:48.260 --> 12:51.388
- I lost everything. Anything
like that ever happen to you?

12:51.430 --> 12:54.536
- Ugh. If I lost everything,
I'd be a complete mess.

12:54.570 --> 12:56.936
- Surprisingly, it's not
the end of the world.

12:56.970 --> 12:59.165
- Way to put on a brave face.

12:59.210 --> 13:01.371
A cute, brave face.

13:01.410 --> 13:03.378
- I don't think it's wrong
talking about money on a date.

13:03.410 --> 13:06.004
- My CFO is worried about
security, but I guess that's--

13:06.050 --> 13:07.972
- How much money
are we talking about?

13:10.490 --> 13:13.311
- I've got a Kickstarter
campaign for a zombie repellent.

13:13.360 --> 13:15.180
- Cool.

13:15.220 --> 13:17.381
- Do you want to know why
all your money was stolen

13:17.430 --> 13:19.955
by your ex
- You bet I do.

13:20.000 --> 13:22.355
- It's because you haven't
given yourself over to him.

13:22.400 --> 13:25.221
Completely.
- Him...

13:25.270 --> 13:27.591
Satan?

13:27.640 --> 13:30.234
People think believing in
the occult means you can't

13:30.270 --> 13:33.068
have a fun social
life. Not true.

13:33.110 --> 13:34.998
He will strip away false desire

13:35.040 --> 13:36.974
and satisfy only
the needs that matter.

13:37.010 --> 13:41.219
- Well, I don't know much
about pagan rituals,

13:41.250 --> 13:44.583
but I like what I've heard.

13:44.620 --> 13:48.158
- I mean, I don't usually like
to talk about my financials--

13:48.190 --> 13:50.158
- Wow. Beautiful,
smart, savvy and funny?

13:50.190 --> 13:52.954
You're the whole package.
And I know packages.

13:53.000 --> 13:55.321
As a lavwer, I mean.

13:55.360 --> 13:58.227
Corporate lawyer.
Bay Street lavwer.

13:58.270 --> 14:01.034
- So you're a lawyer.
- Either that or medical school.

14:09.910 --> 14:11.878
- My date recognized me.

14:11.910 --> 14:14.049
She thinks all pro hockey
players are players...

14:14.080 --> 14:17.049
...which makes sense,
because we are. How's it going?

14:17.090 --> 14:19.479
- It's not going anywhere
because I'm talking to you!

14:19.520 --> 14:23.388
- Well, have at it.
Oh, FYI, I'm crushing it.

14:23.430 --> 14:25.386
- Hanging up now.
I'm crushing it too.

14:25.430 --> 14:28.888
Sorry.
- No problem. Jeremy.

14:28.930 --> 14:31.398
- Angie. So what do
you do for a living?

14:31.430 --> 14:34.297
- Oh, I own an ad agency.

14:34.340 --> 14:36.296
It's mostly web-based.

14:36.340 --> 14:38.160
But talking about our jobs
is just so boring.

14:38.210 --> 14:40.235
- Ad agency. You must be

14:40.280 --> 14:43.249
terrifically visual
and very organized.

14:43.280 --> 14:45.248
- I guess.
- Probably really great

14:45.280 --> 14:49.273
at managing money. I'm hopeless.
- I'm worse, trust me.

14:49.320 --> 14:52.983
Did you grow up in Toronto?

14:53.020 --> 14:55.079
- What can that
teach you about me?

14:55.120 --> 14:58.248
- I only have two minutes. Less.

14:58.290 --> 15:01.259
- OK, yeah. I grew
up here. Downtown.

15:01.300 --> 15:03.621
- Jarvis.

15:03.670 --> 15:05.626
- English.

15:07.670 --> 15:10.434
A cat. Mittens.

15:10.470 --> 15:13.303
- No way! I had
a cat named Mittens.

15:13.340 --> 15:16.002
- What a crazy coincidence.

15:16.040 --> 15:20.079
- This is so much better than
talking about money, isn't it?

15:20.120 --> 15:22.372
- You're so right.
Can I tell you a secret?

15:22.420 --> 15:25.685
I think it's so boring when
people wait until the third
date before they--

15:30.990 --> 15:33.527
Right. Forgot about this.
- Is this where we act like

15:33.560 --> 15:36.529
we're really into each other?
- So we make other people
jealous. Good idea.

15:36.560 --> 15:40.291
- OK. You go first.
- OK. Your ex-manager.

15:40.340 --> 15:44.299
What exactly happened there?
- We'd need more

15:44.340 --> 15:46.638
than two minutes
to get through that story.

15:46.670 --> 15:49.309
- Fine. Gimme the spiel.

15:49.340 --> 15:52.309
- What would Matt Shade's
closing arguments be

15:52.350 --> 15:54.716
if this were a real date?

15:54.750 --> 15:57.617
- I know we've just met,

15:57.650 --> 16:00.380
and I know I'm only
getting 10 percent,

16:00.420 --> 16:04.026
but that 10 percent
in my corner?

16:04.060 --> 16:06.528
There's nothing I couldn't do.

16:06.560 --> 16:09.529
And there's nothing
I wouldn't do

16:09.560 --> 16:12.324
to earn just five percent more.

16:14.640 --> 16:19.202
And that is why I'm crushing it.

16:21.210 --> 16:24.077
- Oh! Got another one.

16:26.150 --> 16:28.243
I think my phone is busted.
- It's OK if you didn't get

16:28.280 --> 16:30.646
any date requests. Women
are tough nuts to crack.

16:30.690 --> 16:34.182
- Did you sandbag me with that
whole Sarah McLachlan thing?

16:34.220 --> 16:36.518
- What immense pleasure
would I get from that?

16:36.560 --> 16:38.653
And they haven't seen
our profiles yet.

16:38.690 --> 16:42.023
Am I in a slump?

16:42.060 --> 16:44.369
- Oh, come on.
I was just kidding.

16:44.400 --> 16:46.322
It's really starting to pile up.

16:46.370 --> 16:48.338
Let's go grab Vanessa
and see if she recognizes

16:48.370 --> 16:50.509
any of these guys.
- You go ahead.

16:50.540 --> 16:52.428
I'm going to take
a little detour.

16:52.470 --> 16:55.268
Good for you, Shade.

16:55.310 --> 16:57.301
- It's for my daughter.

16:57.350 --> 16:59.477
- I know it is.

16:59.510 --> 17:01.740
I'll put it on vibrate.

17:04.150 --> 17:06.289
- That's not helping.

17:14.330 --> 17:16.491
: Teenagers.
They are the ultimate challenge.

17:16.530 --> 17:18.794
- Yeah.

17:18.830 --> 17:21.162
Sign language?

17:21.200 --> 17:23.600
- My teenage nephew is deaf

17:23.640 --> 17:26.336
and I'm pretty sure
he's swearing at me in sign,

17:26.370 --> 17:30.079
so I hope to blow
his mind with this.

17:30.110 --> 17:32.647
- That looks dangerous.
- Trust me, it is.

17:34.650 --> 17:36.618
So, your teenager?
- A daughter.

17:36.650 --> 17:39.448
14. Actually,
she's legally blind.

17:39.490 --> 17:42.254
- Brave girl, I imagine.

17:42.290 --> 17:44.258
- Sometimes I worry too brave
for her own good.

17:44.290 --> 17:46.349
- That can only happen
when children feel secure

17:46.390 --> 17:48.358
in their home life.

17:48.400 --> 17:51.164
- That's the nicest thing
anyone's said to me in a while.

17:57.740 --> 18:00.402
Sorry, I normally make it a rule

18:00.440 --> 18:04.604
to not just stand and stare
at people like an idiot.

18:04.650 --> 18:07.118
- It's OK. I normally
make it a rule

18:07.150 --> 18:09.744
not to interrupt
people in bookstores

18:09.780 --> 18:11.748
when they are reading.

18:11.790 --> 18:16.215
But sometimes it's fun
to break your rules, no?

18:16.260 --> 18:18.626
- Matt.

18:18.660 --> 18:21.629
- Sylvie.

18:21.660 --> 18:23.696
Good luck with
your daughter, Matt.

18:25.630 --> 18:29.566
Would you be
interested in getting together

18:29.600 --> 18:32.330
over coffee and discussing
more about teenagers...

18:32.370 --> 18:35.237
or any other subject you want?

18:37.680 --> 18:39.875
- Definitely.

18:50.860 --> 18:53.420
- Don't lose the bookmark.

18:58.270 --> 19:01.296
- And... ping!

19:01.340 --> 19:03.535
: Recognize
any of these people?

19:06.540 --> 19:08.838
- I remember this guy
from my speed-dating event.

19:08.880 --> 19:11.599
Ken Barnes. He's a doctor.

19:11.650 --> 19:13.675
- He told me he was a lavwer.

19:13.720 --> 19:15.813
Add him to the suspect list.

19:15.850 --> 19:17.818
- I honestly think
the worst part of this

19:17.850 --> 19:19.841
is never being able
to trust anyone again.

19:19.890 --> 19:23.553
- Angie doesn't trust anyone
already, so that's the
only part for her.

19:23.590 --> 19:25.558
- One of life's
little efficiencies.

19:25.590 --> 19:28.559
- He'll slip up eventually.

19:28.600 --> 19:31.194
They always do.
- Here's another one

19:31.230 --> 19:34.336
of your pings. Look where
he's been in the last month.

19:34.370 --> 19:36.497
Miami, New York, Colorado.

19:36.540 --> 19:39.338
- The same cities the ID thief
bought the rare coins.

19:39.370 --> 19:43.409
Jeremy Cairns.

19:43.450 --> 19:45.372
Rosedale address. Nice digs.

19:45.410 --> 19:47.378
Do you recognize him?

19:47.420 --> 19:50.412
- Maybe...
- So Jeremy Cairns thinks

19:50.450 --> 19:52.486
you're an easy mark.
What's our next move?

19:52.520 --> 19:54.579
- You look into doctor
slash lawyer Ken.

19:54.620 --> 19:56.815
And...

19:56.860 --> 19:58.828
I've got a date
with an identity thief.

20:01.960 --> 20:04.793
- I understand you need me to
be a different kind of parent

20:04.830 --> 20:07.367
in different situations.

20:07.400 --> 20:09.493
Sometimes you need me
to be a confidant.

20:09.540 --> 20:12.464
And other times,
you need me to be a...

20:14.480 --> 20:16.675
Uh...

20:16.710 --> 20:18.701
Other...

20:22.420 --> 20:26.618
"Cheerleader." Other times you
need me to be a cheerleader.

20:30.830 --> 20:33.890
Hey. I still think I should be
out there with you in the field.

20:33.930 --> 20:36.490
- We're looking for an identity
thief, not a serial killer.

20:36.530 --> 20:38.964
I've got this.
- We could put a wire on you

20:39.000 --> 20:40.991
and I could follow
behind, listening.

20:41.040 --> 20:44.305
- Does this scenario involve
you helping me put on a Wire?

20:44.340 --> 20:46.604
- It's hard to do solo.

20:46.640 --> 20:50.440
Stake out Ken so you can figure
out what he really does
for a living.

20:50.480 --> 20:53.415
- OK. You call if you need
backup. Or help with a zipper.

20:59.350 --> 21:01.386
- What, are you
going to a funeral?

21:01.420 --> 21:03.980
- Get the door.

21:07.930 --> 21:10.467
- L_iam.
- Hi, Sir.

21:10.500 --> 21:12.821
- Well, come on in.
- Thank you.

21:14.840 --> 21:18.298
- So. Graduating from
study buddy, huh?

21:18.340 --> 21:20.900
- Ha, yeah.
- Hey, Liam. Tell me about

21:20.940 --> 21:23.374
your mother. Three things.

21:23.410 --> 21:25.298
- Yeah.
- Um...

21:25.350 --> 21:27.409
She's really smart.
She works at a research council

21:27.450 --> 21:30.339
as an epidemiologist.
Oh, she has, like,

21:30.390 --> 21:33.359
over 200 books and she says
she's going to get rid of them

21:33.390 --> 21:36.689
but never does. Uh...
- That's enough. The kid's fine.

21:36.720 --> 21:39.518
How does this look?

21:39.560 --> 21:42.393
- You're going on a date.

21:42.430 --> 21:46.321
- Yeah, well, us December Daters
can't waste any time, you know?

21:46.370 --> 21:49.862
But seriously, is this OK?
- Yeah, you're rockin' it, Dad.

21:49.900 --> 21:52.039
Just don't mention
the Illuminati.

21:52.070 --> 21:54.573
- Those no-good
bastards. See you!

21:54.610 --> 21:56.578
- See you!

21:56.610 --> 21:59.374
- Liam, what you said
about your mom was nice.

21:59.410 --> 22:01.571
Means you respect her.

22:01.620 --> 22:03.918
My dad thinks that it means
you respect all women.

22:03.950 --> 22:06.418
- I do, sir. I really do.

22:06.450 --> 22:09.851
- Uh-huh. Look, Liam,
I've been you.

22:09.890 --> 22:13.758
So I don't want to be the Dad
that threatens the boy

22:13.800 --> 22:16.451
who comes over, courting his
daughter. I don't want to be

22:16.500 --> 22:19.094
the Dad who goes
into vivid detail

22:19.130 --> 22:21.598
about what'll happen to the boy
if his daughter gets hurt

22:21.640 --> 22:24.029
in any way, on any level.

22:24.070 --> 22:26.129
But I will be that Dad.

22:26.170 --> 22:29.378
I'll be that Dad all day
long ifI have to be.

22:29.410 --> 22:32.072
- Hey, Liam.
- Hey.

22:32.110 --> 22:34.419
- Hey, honey.

22:34.450 --> 22:37.078
Liam...

22:37.120 --> 22:40.749
Would you give us a second?
- Uh... uh...

22:40.790 --> 22:44.055
It's kinda cold out here, sir--
- Yeah, just a minute.

22:44.090 --> 22:47.924
Look, honey. I know you need
me to be a different parent

22:47.960 --> 22:51.418
in different situations.
- OK...

22:51.470 --> 22:54.462
- Sometimes you need me to be
a confidant. And other times,

22:54.500 --> 22:57.606
you need me to be a...

22:57.640 --> 23:00.973
Other times, you need me to be--
- Did you rehearse this
or something?

23:01.010 --> 23:03.444
- I didn't want to screw
this up, honey. I read a book.

23:03.480 --> 23:05.948
- Keep reading, Dad.

23:10.550 --> 23:14.088
***

23:28.140 --> 23:30.700
- "And sometimes all
you need is love"?

23:30.740 --> 23:34.471
Seriously?

23:49.920 --> 23:52.184
Hey, you OK?

23:54.600 --> 23:56.989
- [Well, our doctor,
or is it lawyer,]

23:57.030 --> 23:59.066
[lives in the crappiest
building I've ever seen.]

23:59.100 --> 24:01.591
- Oh, well...

24:01.640 --> 24:05.235
if he's our identity thief, then
he's keeping it on the down-low.

24:05.270 --> 24:07.909
- You got that right.
Is your date over?

24:07.940 --> 24:10.079
- No. He just went to
check on our reservation.

24:10.110 --> 24:12.249
- Uh-huh. You sure
you don't need me there?

24:12.280 --> 24:14.111
Looks like Ken's
turned in for the night.

24:16.150 --> 24:18.948
Did someone forget to bring
their sleeping bag?

24:18.990 --> 24:22.050
- I've decided to be the P.I.
who stares down the cold
of a stakeout.

24:22.090 --> 24:24.729
- Well, I'm fine here,
because it's an identity thief,

24:24.760 --> 24:28.196
not a serial killer, remember?
I'll see you tomorrow.

24:37.240 --> 24:39.629
***

24:45.110 --> 24:48.568
- They said 10 minutes.
Don't know if I believe them.

24:48.620 --> 24:52.181
You ordered more drinks?
I like your style.

24:52.220 --> 24:55.018
- Thank you, Jeremy.

24:55.060 --> 24:57.858
I have a feeling that I could
use your help with something.

24:57.890 --> 25:00.597
- Sure. Anything.

25:00.630 --> 25:03.929
- I'm thinking
about re-branding.

25:03.970 --> 25:07.792
Are you taking on new clients?
- Yeah, new clients.

25:07.840 --> 25:11.765
See, the thing is I'm actually
pretty booked up.

25:11.810 --> 25:15.177
For, like, six months.

25:15.210 --> 25:17.178
- I'd really love
to help you out,

25:17.210 --> 25:20.839
but learning about you seems
like a better use of our time.

25:20.880 --> 25:22.848
- So you keep saying.

25:22.880 --> 25:25.781
- Beautiful, smart, funny...

25:25.820 --> 25:27.811
Your own urban
planning busmess?

25:29.820 --> 25:34.120
Let's keep the focus on
the more interesting party.

25:34.160 --> 25:37.789
- Careful. Flattery
will get you everywhere.

25:45.310 --> 25:47.676
- I never should have tried
to memorize the book.

25:47.710 --> 25:49.928
I realize that now.
- You have a lot to learn

25:49.980 --> 25:52.005
about teenage girls.
- That's why I bought the book

25:52.050 --> 25:54.075
in the first place.

25:54.120 --> 25:57.248
The problem is I'm still playing
with the weekend-Dad playbook.

25:57.280 --> 25:59.316
This fulltime thing
is new to me.

25:59.350 --> 26:03.116
I mean, it's great, but it's
tough being a rookie again.

26:03.160 --> 26:06.584
I just don't want to be the Dad
who doesn't get it, you know?

26:06.630 --> 26:09.349
- Have you tried
telling her that?

26:09.400 --> 26:12.221
- See, that sounds smart
when you say it.

26:14.870 --> 26:17.703
I'd really like to
take you out again.

26:17.740 --> 26:19.708
For a whole meal this time.

26:19.740 --> 26:22.208
Appetizers. Desserts. The works.

26:22.240 --> 26:24.140
- Ooh, big spender.

26:28.180 --> 26:31.047
What's wrong?
- I'm sorry, Matt.

26:31.090 --> 26:33.957
I should have told you, but I...

26:33.990 --> 26:36.857
I leave tomorrow, for Paris.

26:36.890 --> 26:39.120
- OK.

26:39.160 --> 26:41.993
That sucks.

26:42.030 --> 26:44.897
- So close to departure,
I usually wouldn't go out

26:44.930 --> 26:47.228
for coffee, but...

26:47.270 --> 26:50.933
I think it's because
I felt a real connection.

26:50.970 --> 26:52.961
- Yeah, me too.

26:58.210 --> 27:00.178
- Do you ever feel like

27:00.210 --> 27:02.678
the difference between
an average night

27:02.720 --> 27:06.019
and a night you'll never forget

27:06.050 --> 27:10.111
is simply making the
choice to have it be so?

27:10.160 --> 27:12.981
- It's all about attitude.

27:13.030 --> 27:15.954
I've seen lesser teams
beat better ones

27:16.000 --> 27:17.991
for exactly that reason.

27:23.140 --> 27:25.301
Average?

27:25.340 --> 27:28.673
Or never forget?

27:33.880 --> 27:36.917
What about your mother?
What does she do?

27:36.950 --> 27:40.818
- She works at the racetrack.

27:40.860 --> 27:43.181
Or maiden?

27:43.220 --> 27:45.381
- The more the merrier.

27:45.430 --> 27:47.386
- As much as I'd love
to talk about my mother,

27:47.430 --> 27:50.149
I'd rather discuss
my third date theory.

27:50.200 --> 27:52.964
The theory about what a waste--
- I remember.

27:53.000 --> 27:56.436
You wanna get out of here?
Go back to your place?

27:56.470 --> 27:59.132
- Unfortunately,
my place is being painted.

27:59.170 --> 28:01.832
I couldn't put you in that--
- I don't mind--

28:01.880 --> 28:03.939
- Couldn't put you.

28:03.980 --> 28:06.198
Unless, of course, you want
to just call it a night.

28:06.250 --> 28:08.445
- No! No, no, no.

28:08.480 --> 28:11.244
Um... it's fine.

28:11.290 --> 28:14.157
We can go back to my place.

28:14.190 --> 28:18.320
- OK.
***

28:24.130 --> 28:27.224
I thought you lived in Rosedale?

28:27.270 --> 28:29.261
- I moved.

28:50.190 --> 28:52.750
- Five minutes away.

28:55.300 --> 28:57.256
Ah, I gotta get this.

28:57.300 --> 29:01.191
Hey. Yeah, I don't know how
your date's going, but mine's--

29:06.110 --> 29:09.136
427 Elmore Avenue. Cute.

29:09.180 --> 29:11.501
I didn't know you could
find such a quiet,

29:14.150 --> 29:17.176
- I gotta go.

29:17.220 --> 29:19.211
- I'm sorry.

29:19.250 --> 29:22.481
You're amazing.

29:27.560 --> 29:30.120
- Suspend all judgment,
ye who enter here.

29:30.160 --> 29:33.789
- Funny.
- I wish I was joking.

29:56.590 --> 29:59.582
- Don't worry, Nanna.
Stand down, soldier.

29:59.630 --> 30:02.190
Jeremy's not our guy.

30:02.230 --> 30:04.198
He's another victim.

30:04.230 --> 30:06.221
: Coffee cake?

30:14.280 --> 30:16.339
- I always thought
that I was untouchable,

30:16.380 --> 30:18.871
and then along comes
this thief in the night

30:18.910 --> 30:21.140
and steals your life away.
- It proves how little

30:21.180 --> 30:23.148
control you have.

30:23.180 --> 30:25.182
- You know, I actually tracked
down where they spent my money.

30:25.220 --> 30:27.438
The trail didn't
go very far, though.

30:27.490 --> 30:31.085
- In Florida and Colorado.

30:31.130 --> 30:34.224
They wouldn't tell me anything.
- They guarantee the privacy
of the purchaser.

30:34.260 --> 30:36.319
- Even when he's spending
somebody else's money.

30:36.360 --> 30:38.191
- He or she.
- I can't believe this happened

30:38.230 --> 30:42.860
because I went speed-dating.
- Join the club.

30:42.900 --> 30:44.868
- The fact that you both used
the same speed-dating service

30:44.910 --> 30:48.038
is the strongest lead we've got.
- But neither of you went

30:48.080 --> 30:50.002
on a date after the session.
- Which means that

30:50.040 --> 30:52.179
only Constellations would
have seen your questionnaires.

30:52.210 --> 30:56.977
- Meaning we need to find out
more about Enrique the love god.

30:57.020 --> 30:59.238
- [Enrique's inside. We just
have to sit here listening]

31:02.090 --> 31:04.081
Keep the mic still!

31:04.130 --> 31:07.088
[How come I gotta sit
on the cold, hard pavement

31:07.130 --> 31:09.451
And don't give me that
"time-honoured tradition" speech

31:09.500 --> 31:12.298
like at the dumpster.
- Because homeless women

31:12.330 --> 31:15.936
garner too much attention.

31:15.970 --> 31:18.962
Sh, sh.
- It's Enrique.

31:19.010 --> 31:21.604
Listen. Our current
arrangement has stagnated.

31:21.640 --> 31:23.676
It's time to turn
things up a notch.

31:23.710 --> 31:27.100
How long before you can
get here? Good. See you soon.

31:27.150 --> 31:30.119
- That sounds promising.

31:30.150 --> 31:32.289
- Sitting tight is all I've got.

31:32.320 --> 31:34.311
My ass is frozen.

31:39.590 --> 31:41.524
- [She's dating and
not talking to me.]

31:41.560 --> 31:44.393
My dad is dating
and talking way too much.

31:49.070 --> 31:51.038
I gotta take this.

31:51.070 --> 31:53.163
- Stay in character!

31:55.210 --> 31:58.543
[run away from me like that
before. At least not that fast.]

31:58.580 --> 32:00.605
- I'm sorry.
It couldn't be helped.

32:00.650 --> 32:03.312
[Maybe we could try saying
our goodbyes again in person.]

32:03.350 --> 32:06.513
- [I wish I could. But I'm going
back to Paris tonight.]

32:06.550 --> 32:09.110
- So miss your flight.
- So romantic.

32:09.160 --> 32:11.287
- [It is very tempting,
but I think last night]

32:11.330 --> 32:14.299
[may be all we have.
It is a wonderful memory.]

32:14.330 --> 32:17.322
- I bet we can amp that memory
up, if you catch my drift.

32:17.360 --> 32:19.590
- Subtle.

32:21.600 --> 32:25.161
- I'm really sorry,
but I have to go.

32:25.210 --> 32:27.735
Again. Be well, Sylvie.

32:30.040 --> 32:32.406
]
- Look who's coming.

32:32.450 --> 32:35.044
- Ken Barnes.

32:41.290 --> 32:44.088
- No. Forget it.
Speed-dating is one thing,

32:44.130 --> 32:46.086
but going on
a real date afterwards

32:46.130 --> 32:48.394
is completely different and you
know what? It rhymes with "no."

32:48.430 --> 32:51.069
- I'll make it worth your while.
- Ah, look at this.

32:51.100 --> 32:53.068
Cupid and Stupid hatch a plan.

32:53.100 --> 32:54.658
- We're not taking
applications today-—

32:54.700 --> 32:56.668
- That's not why we're here.
We're representing two former

32:56.700 --> 32:59.237
Constellations customers who've
become Victims of identity theft

32:59.270 --> 33:02.671
after attending one
of your speed-dating events.

33:02.710 --> 33:06.373
- So you can hand over their
money in full, or our next
stop can be the 57th division.

33:06.410 --> 33:08.378
- Slow down. I'm happy
to offer a refund

33:08.420 --> 33:11.412
to any dissatisfied customer.
But my business here
is totally legit.

33:11.450 --> 33:13.611
- Yeah, we can tell you're
totally on the up and up.

33:13.650 --> 33:16.551
You and Lawyer-Doctor-
Lumberjack here.

33:16.590 --> 33:18.387
- I don't know
anything about this.

33:18.430 --> 33:21.194
Then what's
your story, hot stuff?

33:23.200 --> 33:26.226
- I'm an actor.

33:26.270 --> 33:29.728
- He's a ringer. Ken of
the multiple identities

33:29.770 --> 33:32.432
and fabulous ass is a plant.

33:32.470 --> 33:35.030
You're gaming your own system.

33:37.180 --> 33:39.273
The people that come to these
events, they're vulnerable

33:39.310 --> 33:42.040
and fearful. Employees like
Ken ensure they leave here

33:42.080 --> 33:44.446
feeling at least somebody finds
them completely fascinating.

33:44.490 --> 33:45.946
- "Be open. Love will find you."

33:45.990 --> 33:49.357
- We're going to need
information on every
employee that works for you.

33:49.390 --> 33:51.722
- I can't do that.
- Or I can call my friend

33:51.760 --> 33:54.593
over at The Star. Ask him to
do a profile on Constellations,

33:54.630 --> 33:56.655
featuring Ken here
as the kind of guy

33:56.700 --> 33:59.294
that women can expect to meet at
one of your speed-dating events.

33:59.330 --> 34:01.730
How does that sound?

34:01.770 --> 34:03.738
- I'll get you the files.

34:03.770 --> 34:07.206
- Any employee with access to
Constellations's customer files

34:07.240 --> 34:09.401
could have easily set up
an identity theft.

34:09.440 --> 34:12.238
- With that access, choosing the
right target would be a breeze.

34:12.280 --> 34:16.273
- They wouldn't even have
to participate in the
speed-dating part.

34:16.320 --> 34:19.414
Are you OK?
- Yeah, I am. I'm fine.

34:19.450 --> 34:21.452
Would you mind if
we split these files

34:21.490 --> 34:24.186
and I worked on this
from home? It's Jules.

34:24.230 --> 34:26.448
I missed her getting home
from her date last night.

34:26.490 --> 34:28.458
I'd like to be there
when she gets home today.

34:28.500 --> 34:31.298
- Of course. Just meet me at
the office when you're done.

34:31.330 --> 34:33.491
Mon petit chou-chou.

34:42.840 --> 34:44.808
- Hey.
- Hello.

34:44.850 --> 34:48.217
- We did.

34:48.250 --> 34:51.139
But I couldn't_ leav_e
Without a parting gift.

34:53.350 --> 34:56.148
- I pushed it.

34:56.190 --> 34:58.579
- Tomorrow.

34:58.630 --> 35:00.655
After that I guess...

35:06.370 --> 35:09.259
- We think someone gained access
to your personal computers,

35:09.300 --> 35:11.131
possibly through
Constellations's

35:11.170 --> 35:13.309
computer system.
- I'm beginning to lose

35:13.340 --> 35:16.173
all faith in humanity.
- I've lost mine completely.

35:16.210 --> 35:18.246
- Now that would
be a genume shame.

35:18.280 --> 35:21.340
- Let me know if any of these
employee pictures look familiar.

35:21.380 --> 35:24.486
Now, you said after
the speed-dating event

35:24.520 --> 35:26.385
that neither of you went
out on any dates, correct?

35:26.420 --> 35:29.548
- I didn't get any pings.
- I seriously can't
believe that.

35:29.590 --> 35:31.922
- Forget about
other speed-daters.

35:31.960 --> 35:33.882
Did you meet anyone
new around that time?

35:33.930 --> 35:36.626
- I became friendly with
a woman at my gym, Helene,

35:36.660 --> 35:38.924
but Cyclefit isn't
a strong basis

35:38.970 --> 35:42.189
for friendship, I suppose.
- I met somebody too.

35:42.240 --> 35:45.334
Veronique. I really thought
we had a connection,

35:45.370 --> 35:48.168
but it fell through.

35:48.210 --> 35:51.441
- She had to move back
home, to Paris.
- To Paris.

35:54.250 --> 35:56.275
There!
- Veronique.

35:56.320 --> 35:59.244
- Oh, my God. Helene.

36:02.520 --> 36:04.829
- Paris.

36:06.260 --> 36:08.899
***

36:27.850 --> 36:30.648
- I didn't want it to be awkward

36:30.680 --> 36:32.614
in case your
daughter comes home.

36:32.650 --> 36:35.687
But...

36:35.720 --> 36:39.724
how about you relax,

36:39.760 --> 36:43.651
and I make us
breakfast for dinner?

36:46.270 --> 36:48.295
- I love breakfast for dinner!

36:48.340 --> 36:50.228
- Mm, good.

36:50.270 --> 36:52.238
Leave it to me.

36:52.270 --> 36:54.977
Have a shower and...

36:55.010 --> 36:57.774
take your time.

36:57.810 --> 37:00.278
- OK.

37:30.080 --> 37:32.275
***

37:51.060 --> 37:55.963
- * Your_ love is better
than ice cream *

37:56.000 --> 37:58.468
- Adieu, Matt Shade.

38:01.880 --> 38:05.771
- No, I wanted to surprise you.

38:05.810 --> 38:08.847
I've rebooked my flight.

38:08.880 --> 38:11.485
- Fantastic.

38:11.520 --> 38:13.988
- So...

38:14.020 --> 38:16.614
Do you like it?
- I'm curious.

38:16.660 --> 38:19.083
Why would you buy me this CD?

38:19.130 --> 38:23.089
- Well, it was playing
in the bookstore when we met.

38:23.130 --> 38:27.669
I'm sure I saw
you Singing along.

38:27.700 --> 38:30.828
- Liking Sarah McLachlan
is a lie I told

38:30.870 --> 38:33.998
on my Constellations
questionnaire,

38:34.040 --> 38:36.634
along with the lie I told
about what I do for a living.

38:36.680 --> 38:38.978
- I saw the pictures
in your office.

38:39.010 --> 38:41.877
So you've lived
a Whole other life.

38:41.920 --> 38:46.038
- I did, before someone
stole it from me.

38:46.090 --> 38:48.615
Now I'm focused on my new life,

38:48.660 --> 38:51.527
as a private investigator
who's been hired

38:51.560 --> 38:53.949
to catch an identity thief.

38:53.990 --> 38:56.094
And I bet if I looked
in your purse right now,

38:56.130 --> 38:58.894
I'd find a couple of
rare coins, wouldn't I?

39:02.770 --> 39:05.568
- Matt.

39:05.610 --> 39:07.862
What happened upstairs,
between us?

39:07.910 --> 39:10.674
That wasn't business.

39:10.710 --> 39:13.508
- It felt a lot_ more like
pleasure, I'll give you that.

39:13.550 --> 39:16.678
- Work with me.

39:16.720 --> 39:20.417
We could make a lot
of money together.

39:20.450 --> 39:22.418
A lot.

39:25.460 --> 39:27.428
- See, here's the thing.

39:27.460 --> 39:29.849
I've already got a partner.

39:29.900 --> 39:34.064
In fact, you should meet her.

39:36.570 --> 39:38.538
- Hi.

39:38.570 --> 39:42.028
- Agh! It burns!

39:42.080 --> 39:44.708
- I know. Try rubbing
your eyes really hard.

39:54.760 --> 39:58.526
- No, don't. Don't.

39:58.560 --> 40:01.529
: So cute.

40:01.560 --> 40:03.790
Aw.

40:07.970 --> 40:11.736
- It's the pepper spray.
- Yeah. Me too.

40:11.770 --> 40:13.761
: Ow.
- Ah, ah, ah!

40:17.210 --> 40:20.179
***

40:20.210 --> 40:23.077
Sylvie was a systems
expert who did some work

40:23.120 --> 40:25.145
for the speed-dating
company over a year ago.

40:25.190 --> 40:27.215
- She set up a mirror site
that allowed her access

40:27.250 --> 40:29.218
to everyone's profiles.

40:29.260 --> 40:31.182
- The police found
her rare coin collection.

40:31.220 --> 40:34.155
It may take some time,
but you'll get your money back.

40:34.190 --> 40:36.124
- Thank you.

40:36.160 --> 40:39.027
I feel like you've given
me a new lease on life.

40:39.070 --> 40:41.698
- I can echo that.

40:41.740 --> 40:44.129
You know, the strange thing
is this really feels like

40:44.170 --> 40:46.468
_ one of those worst _
thing-best thing scenarios.

40:46.510 --> 40:48.978
How's that?
- Sometimes it's good

40:49.010 --> 40:52.104
to remember starting over's
not the end of the world.

40:54.750 --> 40:56.945
: Yeah.

40:56.980 --> 40:59.016
- Wow.

40:59.050 --> 41:03.111
We could give Constellations
a run for its money.

41:21.010 --> 41:23.035
OK, look.

41:23.080 --> 41:26.504
Honey, this is over.

41:26.550 --> 41:30.668
- Us not being able
to talk to each other.
- Yeah, I don't like it either.

41:30.720 --> 41:34.019
- I trust you and
I know you're smart.

41:34.050 --> 41:36.109
But these boys coming around,

41:36.160 --> 41:38.014
all I can see is my little girl

41:38.060 --> 41:40.528
and all I want to do
is protect you.

41:40.560 --> 41:43.893
I was talking at you
and not to you,

41:43.930 --> 41:47.195
and I'm sorry, OK?
: OK.

41:47.230 --> 41:49.562
- Man. I have just
come from the best...

41:49.600 --> 41:52.103
run.

41:52.140 --> 41:55.803
- Dad, maybe you should...

41:55.840 --> 41:58.229
go take a shower
and get cleaned up.

41:58.280 --> 42:00.202
From your run.

42:00.250 --> 42:02.309
- That's a good idea.

42:06.190 --> 42:09.751
- So that's what they
mean by "walk of shame."

42:09.790 --> 42:11.849
- Honey, I know I said that
we should talk about everything,

42:11.890 --> 42:13.619
but not that. Never that.
- Agreed. Yeah.

42:13.660 --> 42:16.629
- Yeah. Wow.

42:20.630 --> 42:22.837
- Part of Sylvie's MO.
was to make sure her victim

42:22.870 --> 42:25.839
didn't get any date
request pings after
the speed-dating event.

42:25.870 --> 42:27.838
- To make them feel vulnerable.
- Mm-hmm.

42:27.870 --> 42:29.872
- Smar_t. _
- Once her mirror Site

42:29.910 --> 42:32.799
was dismantled,
my phone blew up. Ping city.

42:32.850 --> 42:35.717
- We'll see.

42:35.750 --> 42:38.719
- So tell me, does it count
as the end of a slump

42:38.750 --> 42:40.786
if sex was part of the con?

42:40.820 --> 42:42.981
- Again -- there was no slump.

42:43.020 --> 42:45.853
- You're evading the question.
- A gentleman never tells.

42:45.890 --> 42:48.029
You know, I feel
like we never really

42:48.060 --> 42:50.028
gave our speed date a chance.

42:50.060 --> 42:52.028
- As the French
say: c'est la Vie.

42:52.070 --> 42:55.164
- I think you're the
expert there.

42:55.200 --> 42:57.361
- Most of the time,
she was speechless.

42:57.400 --> 43:00.608
- Ugh, too much information.
- You wanted to know.

43:00.640 --> 43:02.972
- Speaking of which,
we have time now.

43:03.010 --> 43:05.046
IfI asked about
your ex-manager,

43:05.080 --> 43:07.048
would you deflect
with some funny line

43:07.080 --> 43:09.139
or tell me What really happened?

43:09.180 --> 43:12.786
I trusted the wrong person.

43:12.820 --> 43:14.788
- Hate when that happens.

43:14.820 --> 43:17.311
You know, this
speed-dating thing

43:17.360 --> 43:20.056
reminds me of what my dad used
to call the "two-minute you."

43:20.090 --> 43:23.150
- I'm listening.
- Well, anyone can put
on a show for two minutes.

43:23.200 --> 43:25.919
But it's someone you want to
spend that third minute with...

43:25.970 --> 43:28.689
that's the person
you're looking for.

43:30.700 --> 43:33.066
- That's a solid theory.

43:33.110 --> 43:35.806
