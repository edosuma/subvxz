I was here about a paying job.

09:30.361 --> 09:31.696
Yeah. There is a small stipend.

09:31.737 --> 09:33.739
- Oh, okay.
- What? You can't do that.

09:33.781 --> 09:35.700
You can't pay somebody
to date Lisa.

09:35.741 --> 09:37.493
Well, it's either that
or Cousin Tate.

09:37.535 --> 09:40.454
Who I know firsthand
is from a good family.

09:40.496 --> 09:42.206
No. Lisa can't date
one of her cousins.

09:42.248 --> 09:43.332
I shouldn't
have to tell you that.

09:43.374 --> 09:44.834
Oh, Tessa, plenty

09:44.875 --> 09:46.085
of respectable cousin couples

09:46.127 --> 09:47.420
have found love together.

09:47.461 --> 09:48.671
Look at the Giulianis.

09:48.713 --> 09:50.965
It's a no.

09:51.007 --> 09:53.175
You know, it's the taboo
that makes it thrilling.

09:54.176 --> 09:56.345
- Right?
- Yeah.

09:56.387 --> 09:59.181
(Tessa)
Meanwhile, Yoni was just
one sage leaf closer

09:59.223 --> 10:01.017
to getting what he wanted
from the Royces.

10:01.058 --> 10:03.519
Let go of all your
negative energy.

10:03.561 --> 10:05.313
You must.

10:05.354 --> 10:07.273
One of my spiritual teachers
taught me this.

10:07.315 --> 10:09.483
(Dalia)
Was it Yoda?

10:09.525 --> 10:13.696
Oh, my gosh. Look at Yakult.
She's sound asleep.

10:13.738 --> 10:15.239
You calmed her, Yoni.

10:15.281 --> 10:17.783
Well, it wasn't so much
the work of Yoni

10:17.825 --> 10:20.161
as it was the absence of George.

10:20.202 --> 10:22.872
Every since you banned him
from your home

10:22.913 --> 10:24.582
and agreed to not let him

10:24.624 --> 10:28.127
wax your walrus,
the dog has found peace.

10:28.169 --> 10:31.672
Well, we typically
don't refer to it as my walrus.

10:31.714 --> 10:35.092
And I don't recall
banning George from my home.

10:35.134 --> 10:37.720
You do or you do not want the
dog to make the full recovery?

10:37.762 --> 10:38.846
I do.

10:38.888 --> 10:39.889
Then get her a dish with

10:39.930 --> 10:40.973
spring water

10:41.015 --> 10:42.850
for when she wakes..

10:42.892 --> 10:44.852
...she will be thirsty.

10:46.729 --> 10:48.856
Are you my new daddy?

10:48.898 --> 10:50.024
No.

10:51.275 --> 10:52.735
Well, certainly not yet.

10:52.777 --> 10:54.111
But you're trying to be?

10:54.153 --> 10:55.780
You know, it's..

10:55.821 --> 10:57.406
...less about me
being your daddy

10:57.448 --> 11:00.326
and more about the other guy
being your daddy.

11:00.368 --> 11:02.286
Also I'd like the use
of your guest house

11:02.328 --> 11:04.330
for another four to six weeks.

11:04.372 --> 11:07.291
I'm in between places,
and my credit is..

11:07.333 --> 11:09.960
...you know...iffy.

11:12.004 --> 11:14.632
Hey, Lisa, I want you to know
I'm working on the man sitch

11:14.674 --> 11:16.634
but your parents
aren't really making it easy.

11:16.676 --> 11:18.719
You know what?
That's-that's okay, Tessa.

11:18.761 --> 11:20.513
- I'm good to go.
- Good to go?

11:20.554 --> 11:22.723
Uh, I've..

11:22.765 --> 11:24.433
...I've found someone.

11:24.475 --> 11:26.936
Please tell me
it isn't your Cousin Tate.

11:26.977 --> 11:29.271
- Ooh!
- What's the haps, sweet cheeks?

11:29.313 --> 11:30.606
I got some giant sour gumballs

11:30.648 --> 11:32.316
that turn your teeth
crazy colors.

11:32.358 --> 11:33.359
You interested?

11:33.401 --> 11:34.902
Oh, I'm interested.

11:34.944 --> 11:36.195
I'm real interested.

11:36.237 --> 11:37.988
Take a picture, red.
It'll last longer.

11:38.030 --> 11:39.615
- Lisa Marie Shay.
- Yes?

11:39.657 --> 11:42.243
- This kid is in middle school.
- Taking ninth grade math.

11:42.284 --> 11:43.994
- Boom.
- Ha ha ha!

11:44.036 --> 11:46.455
He-he makes me laugh, Tessa.

11:46.497 --> 11:48.916
He makes me laugh,
and he brings me sour stuff

11:48.958 --> 11:51.919
and...when I'm with him,
I just feel--

11:51.961 --> 11:53.504
Prepubescent?

11:53.546 --> 11:55.172
You know I'm your boyfriend's
math tutor, right?

11:55.214 --> 11:56.716
Ho ho ho.

11:56.757 --> 11:58.759
Double boom.

12:04.432 --> 12:06.350
I don't care
if he is Ryan's math tutor

12:06.392 --> 12:09.895
there is no one weirder
online than A.J.

12:09.937 --> 12:11.272
After sifting
through a bunch of

12:11.313 --> 12:13.566
responses from Ren Faire guys

12:13.607 --> 12:16.777
I pulled Lisa's photo,
and decided to fly blind.

12:16.819 --> 12:18.571
I didn't wanna put too much
importance on looks

12:18.612 --> 12:21.198
or guys who only cared
about looks.

12:21.240 --> 12:23.200
I wanted more for Lisa.

12:24.785 --> 12:27.580
Tessa, I hate when people
put half-empty milk cartons

12:27.621 --> 12:29.290
back in the fridge
without saying anything.

12:29.331 --> 12:32.084
To me it doesn't look
half-empty. It looks half-full.

12:32.126 --> 12:34.503
Oh, I-I see. So..

12:34.545 --> 12:36.338
You think I'm negative
too, huh?

12:36.380 --> 12:37.882
I'm just saying
there's plenty of milk.

12:37.923 --> 12:39.675
Yeah, but because I don't think
there's plenty of milk

12:39.717 --> 12:43.679
I'm-I'm a bad person,
an, an undesirable partner.

12:43.721 --> 12:45.890
[chuckles]
Is that it?

12:45.931 --> 12:47.141
- Are you okay?
- No!

12:47.183 --> 12:48.517
No, apparently, I'm not okay.

12:48.559 --> 12:51.687
Apparently, I'm negative,
and dark and moody.

12:51.729 --> 12:53.731
According to the man that's
shacking up with my girlfriend.

12:53.773 --> 12:57.485
- Dallas is shacking up with--
- Yoni.

12:57.526 --> 12:59.487
- He's back.
- Yani is back?

12:59.528 --> 13:02.114
No. No, not Yani. Yoni.

13:02.156 --> 13:04.366
Yoni. Yo-Yoni.

13:04.408 --> 13:06.243
To say his name you must
purse your lips as if you're

13:06.285 --> 13:08.245
giving a kiss to someone
I'm in a relationship with.

13:08.287 --> 13:10.456
Hmm. Yoni.

13:11.707 --> 13:13.042
- Yoni.
- Okay.

13:13.083 --> 13:15.461
Well, dad, take it from me.

13:15.503 --> 13:17.671
The dating scene
is pretty dry right now.

13:17.713 --> 13:22.551
So, unless you want to engage
in some 16th-century role-play

13:22.593 --> 13:25.513
and joust for your maiden

13:25.554 --> 13:27.681
I suggest you quit moping.

13:29.266 --> 13:30.893
Oh, and, father

13:30.935 --> 13:34.897
if you can't outsmart...Yoni

13:34.939 --> 13:38.567
well, then perhaps
you are not my father at all.

13:38.609 --> 13:42.154
Fine, I'll reclaim my wench..

13:42.196 --> 13:43.697
...and get some more milk.

13:43.739 --> 13:45.366
Okay, seven bites of meat
before you

13:45.407 --> 13:47.284
make a beeline for dessert.
You hear me, mister?

13:47.326 --> 13:49.453
I'm about to make a beeline
for something else.

13:49.495 --> 13:50.496
How about a kiss, doll face?

13:50.538 --> 13:52.248
Okay, don't get fresh.

13:52.289 --> 13:54.333
Lisa, I need to talk to you.

13:54.375 --> 13:56.168
- What?
- Alone.

13:56.210 --> 13:57.795
Oh...okay.

13:57.837 --> 14:00.339
Just, just one second there.

14:00.381 --> 14:01.382
What is this all about?

14:01.423 --> 14:03.092
It's about finding you a man

14:03.133 --> 14:07.471
who can cut his own meat. Look.

14:07.513 --> 14:09.890
Tessa, did you place a personal
ad for me on the world wide web?

14:09.932 --> 14:11.392
Yes, Lisa, I did.

14:11.433 --> 14:13.143
And I got a response
from a guy

14:13.185 --> 14:15.437
who sounds pretty great. Listen.

14:15.479 --> 14:17.690
"Let's hold hands,
not devices."

14:17.731 --> 14:20.442
He has hands? Or do you think
he's just lying to sound good?

14:20.484 --> 14:23.153
No, I think he has hands.

14:23.195 --> 14:24.280
What?

14:27.283 --> 14:29.618
I can't believe A.J. would defy
me and go straight for desert.

14:29.660 --> 14:30.911
No way he had
seven bites of meat.

14:30.953 --> 14:32.746
No way. Okay. I'm in.

14:32.788 --> 14:34.206
But you and Ryan
have to come, 'cause--

14:34.248 --> 14:35.791
Okay, great.
Double date. Sounds fun.

14:35.833 --> 14:37.501
Okay. Well, just..
Will you excuse me?

14:37.543 --> 14:39.336
I have to put somebody
in a time-out.

14:39.378 --> 14:42.256
Anthony James, how many times
have we had this conversation?

14:42.298 --> 14:43.424
Food is a privilege!

14:45.259 --> 14:47.553
Sometimes, instead of walking
away from a problem

14:47.595 --> 14:49.805
you have to do the opposite

14:49.847 --> 14:51.682
and take it for a walk.

14:56.270 --> 14:58.230
[George whispering]
Not a word.

15:02.192 --> 15:04.278
Daddy Altman?

15:04.320 --> 15:06.822
- Are you abducting our dog?
- What? No. No.

15:06.864 --> 15:10.284
No, I was, uh, I was just
gonna take her for a walk.

15:10.326 --> 15:12.953
Uh...wanna come with?

15:15.080 --> 15:16.832
And I guess I'm just
having a hard time

15:16.874 --> 15:18.918
wrapping my head around
why a loving God

15:18.959 --> 15:21.295
would ask Abraham
or whatever

15:21.337 --> 15:24.048
to sacrifice his,
like, precious son.

15:24.089 --> 15:27.217
I mean, what kind of power trip
must he have been on?

15:27.259 --> 15:29.386
'And also if I do
go down this route'

15:29.428 --> 15:32.806
I already totally got jerked
on the whole bat mitzvah thing.

15:32.848 --> 15:35.184
And in closing, kugel..

15:36.393 --> 15:38.354
Why?

15:38.395 --> 15:41.231
Well, tho-those
are all good questions.

15:41.273 --> 15:43.525
- 'Thank you.'
- Ex-except the last one.

15:43.567 --> 15:45.778
Man, it's so great
to hear what's

15:45.819 --> 15:47.571
going on inside your head.

15:47.613 --> 15:49.281
Yeah.

15:49.323 --> 15:51.742
And also,
I'm failing science.

15:51.784 --> 15:53.452
While George
continued uncovering

15:53.494 --> 15:55.162
the mystery that was Dalia

15:55.204 --> 15:57.539
I was selling Lisa on
the merits of her mystery date.

15:57.581 --> 15:59.541
- Okay, so listen to this.
- Yeah?

15:59.583 --> 16:02.294
Every morning at dawn,
he writes a poem.

16:02.336 --> 16:06.006
And every evening at sunset,
he burns it.

16:06.048 --> 16:07.299
Why?

16:07.341 --> 16:10.594
Because the poem
only belonged to the day.

16:10.636 --> 16:12.304
Wow, I mean, talk about

16:12.346 --> 16:14.014
holding yourself
to a high standard.

16:14.056 --> 16:16.058
- No, I know.
- That's what it's all about.

16:16.100 --> 16:17.101
- Right?
- Totally.

16:17.142 --> 16:18.519
Yeah.

16:18.560 --> 16:20.771
Oh, and I-I-I brought
a copy of his

16:20.813 --> 16:23.232
favorite book so we could
discuss it at dinner.

16:23.273 --> 16:26.193
I'm only six chapters through,
but so far, it's really good.

16:26.235 --> 16:28.445
Great, um, so I guess

16:28.487 --> 16:31.115
I'll just listen to you guys
while you talk about it, or..

16:31.156 --> 16:33.242
Crap.

16:33.283 --> 16:35.077
I totally should have had
you read it.

16:35.119 --> 16:36.120
It's okay.

16:36.161 --> 16:37.204
'I guess just 'cause we've been'

16:37.246 --> 16:38.372
'e-mailing back and forth'

16:38.414 --> 16:40.833
I kind of got sucked in.

16:40.874 --> 16:43.085
Are you falling
for my Internet boyfriend

16:43.127 --> 16:44.336
before I've had a chance to?

16:44.378 --> 16:45.629
Don't be ridiculous.

16:45.671 --> 16:47.339
I'm very happy
with my boyfriend

16:47.381 --> 16:48.674
and you're gonna
be really happy

16:48.716 --> 16:51.760
with my ex-boyfriend.

16:51.802 --> 16:54.346
- Scott Strauss.
- Tessa.

16:54.388 --> 16:56.765
I found an awesome parking spot.

16:56.807 --> 16:58.600
Sorry. We're handicapped, right?

16:58.642 --> 17:00.394
- Right.
- Very.

17:05.774 --> 17:07.359
If a flicker of regret
crossed my mind

17:07.401 --> 17:08.902
it was erased by the time
the first chunk

17:08.944 --> 17:10.612
of cheese-soaked baguette
hit my lips.

17:10.654 --> 17:12.489
Listening to him talk,
I was reminded

17:12.531 --> 17:14.992
of the great
Scott Strauss paradox.

17:15.034 --> 17:16.827
How could someone
who looked so good on paper

17:16.869 --> 17:20.998
and looks so good in person
be such a freakin' bore?

17:21.040 --> 17:24.460
Let's think about that
as we share this cheese.

17:24.501 --> 17:27.337
So I heard you were
journaling in Barcelona?

17:27.379 --> 17:29.423
Barcelona destroyed me.

17:29.465 --> 17:31.550
Nearly destroyed
my whole family.

17:31.592 --> 17:34.428
- I'll never go back there.
- No, I-I know what you mean.

17:34.470 --> 17:38.223
My family stayed at an
all-inclusive in Cancun and..

17:38.265 --> 17:40.225
...it wasn't great.

17:42.686 --> 17:45.981
Although I did like that you
could pay for things with beads.

17:46.023 --> 17:50.110
I have a question. How do you
get your hair so silky?

17:50.152 --> 17:52.196
You have to admit,
it's incredibly silky.

17:52.237 --> 17:55.074
I use jojoba oil
that I hand-squeeze

17:55.115 --> 17:57.159
'from organic jojoba seeds
that I grow'

17:57.201 --> 17:59.912
in a planter that I built
from jojoba husks.

17:59.953 --> 18:01.914
[thinking]
Oh, my God.
Stop saying jojoba.

18:01.955 --> 18:04.583
Jojoba is also
a natural bug repellent.

18:04.625 --> 18:05.667
A lot of people
don't know that.

18:05.709 --> 18:06.877
Uh-uh.

18:06.919 --> 18:09.004
I didn't mean
to sound condescending.

18:09.046 --> 18:10.714
- No, no..
- Just truly..

18:10.756 --> 18:11.965
People don't know that.

18:12.007 --> 18:14.510
Back to your hair,
may I feel it?

18:16.178 --> 18:18.138
I want you to.

18:21.558 --> 18:22.643
Oh-h-h.

18:24.353 --> 18:25.562
[sighs]

18:25.604 --> 18:26.814
Tessa, leave me for him.

18:26.855 --> 18:28.398
- You have to.
- No.

18:28.440 --> 18:30.109
There's no accounting for love

18:30.150 --> 18:32.236
but when you find
the right person, you know it.

18:32.277 --> 18:33.278
[banging]

18:33.320 --> 18:35.155
Lisa! Baby, I miss us!

18:35.197 --> 18:36.573
'Lisa!'

18:36.615 --> 18:37.658
Oh, my God.

18:37.699 --> 18:40.077
Lisa?

18:40.119 --> 18:41.578
Lisa-a-a!

18:41.620 --> 18:43.455
Hey. Where are you going?

18:43.497 --> 18:44.998
Tessa, I'm ver.. I'm sorry.

18:45.040 --> 18:46.959
But I have to get out of here.

18:47.000 --> 18:49.169
This dinner is destroying me.

18:49.211 --> 18:52.381
I'm not gonna find love
in this restaurant. Not tonight.

18:52.422 --> 18:54.383
How do you know?

18:55.551 --> 18:58.053
Because I f-found it once.

18:59.596 --> 19:01.265
And I-I remember
what it felt like

19:01.306 --> 19:03.058
and I, um, I just think

19:03.100 --> 19:06.186
I'm gonna need to learn
to be alone..

19:07.312 --> 19:08.939
...for now.

19:11.775 --> 19:13.777
Unless you wanna sleep over.

19:16.196 --> 19:17.239
Yeah, I'll sleep over.

19:17.281 --> 19:19.366
Okay. Thanks.

19:20.701 --> 19:23.370
[gasp]
Oh, my gosh! Look at Yakult!

19:23.412 --> 19:25.914
She's got a spring
in her step again.

19:25.956 --> 19:28.250
I haven't seen her go that hard
since she was a puppy.

19:29.626 --> 19:31.253
- Really?
- Ugh!

19:31.295 --> 19:32.838
No wonder why I was feeling
body ache

19:32.880 --> 19:34.840
chills, and a loose stool
coming on.

19:34.882 --> 19:37.050
I knew it was either
George Altman

19:37.092 --> 19:38.969
or a parasitic tapeworm.

19:39.011 --> 19:41.847
Oh, wait. I forgot.

19:41.889 --> 19:44.600
Same thing. Burn.

19:44.641 --> 19:46.435
I've been taking the girls
on some walks

19:46.476 --> 19:49.313
spending a little quality time
with the both of them.

19:49.354 --> 19:51.148
And they have
never been happier.

19:51.190 --> 19:52.774
It's true.

19:52.816 --> 19:55.152
And Daddy Altman
lets me walk off the leash.

19:55.194 --> 19:57.696
Yoni, you said dog walking was

19:57.738 --> 20:00.157
poochie propaganda perpetuated
by the poop bag peeps.

20:00.199 --> 20:03.619
Yeah, the truth is, I..

20:03.660 --> 20:05.245
...I don't really know much
about dogs.

20:05.287 --> 20:07.789
So...George was right?

20:07.831 --> 20:10.292
This was just an elaborate ruse
to try to get me back

20:10.334 --> 20:11.835
because you're still
in love with me?

20:11.877 --> 20:15.088
No. He just doesn't want
Daddy Altman to have you.

20:15.130 --> 20:16.757
A-and he wants to stay
in your guest house

20:16.798 --> 20:18.717
because his credit is iffy.

20:18.759 --> 20:20.260
(Yoni)
It is not my fault.

20:20.302 --> 20:21.970
I was living with this chick
that I met at Burning Man.

20:22.012 --> 20:23.639
She was on ecstasy, and

20:23.680 --> 20:25.682
she got a hold of my
PIN number.

20:25.724 --> 20:27.267
Nobody cares, Yoni.

20:27.309 --> 20:29.061
- 'It's time for you to go.'
- 'Wait, wait.'

20:29.102 --> 20:31.980
- Let me stay for 4 to 6 weeks.
- '4 to 6 weeks?'

20:32.022 --> 20:33.941
Can I at least borrow
five bucks for cigarettes?

20:33.982 --> 20:35.817
- No!
- No.

20:35.859 --> 20:37.319
Come on, Yakult.

20:37.361 --> 20:39.404
Let's go play that game
Daddy Altman invented

20:39.446 --> 20:41.490
where I throw a ball
and you bring it back.

20:42.574 --> 20:44.534
What's it called?

20:44.576 --> 20:46.787
Bring it back?

20:46.828 --> 20:48.330
Mm-hmm.

20:49.539 --> 20:51.833
Come on, Yakult.

20:51.875 --> 20:53.794
You know she's
failing science, right?

20:53.835 --> 20:55.671
- What?
- Yeah.

20:55.712 --> 20:57.506
Well, how do you know that?

20:57.547 --> 20:59.132
I talked to her.

20:59.174 --> 21:00.467
She's also toying with the idea

21:00.509 --> 21:02.511
of converting to Judaism.

21:02.552 --> 21:03.929
- Dalia is?
- Yeah.

21:03.971 --> 21:05.180
So what now?

21:05.222 --> 21:06.807
Take the damn dog for a walk

21:06.848 --> 21:08.141
around the block

21:08.183 --> 21:10.602
and do science flash cards
as we go?

21:10.644 --> 21:12.479
Stop for bagels along the way?

21:12.521 --> 21:13.855
Sound like a plan.

21:13.897 --> 21:16.191
No more healers,
dog walkers, or gurus.

21:16.233 --> 21:17.943
From now on, we handle

21:17.985 --> 21:20.195
all our problems ourselves.

21:20.237 --> 21:22.239
So wait.

21:22.281 --> 21:25.826
The dog throws the ball,
and I do what now?

21:25.867 --> 21:28.495
You know what? We might wanna
hire a specialist for this one.
