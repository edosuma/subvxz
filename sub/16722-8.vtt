00:20.795 --> 00:22.744
Hey, remember my fart from last night?

00:22.867 --> 00:24.017
Be more specific.

00:24.051 --> 00:25.852
Maybe this will ring a bell.
(fart noise)

00:25.886 --> 00:27.887
Oh, yeah.
(farting "Yankee Doodle Dandy")

00:27.922 --> 00:29.038
I taught it to love its country.

00:29.072 --> 00:31.073
It's "Stankee Doodle Dandy."

00:31.091 --> 00:33.042
(laughter)

00:33.076 --> 00:34.510
Cool. Play something else.

00:34.545 --> 00:35.662
Play "Happy Birthday"

00:35.696 --> 00:36.963
'cause my birthday's coming up.

00:36.997 --> 00:38.047
Play "Happy Stankee Birthday."

00:38.082 --> 00:39.182
Do it. Do it.

00:39.216 --> 00:40.984
It'll be funny. Do it.

00:41.018 --> 00:42.518
Hey, Courtney, take a chill pill.

00:42.553 --> 00:43.870
(gasping) Oh, my gosh.

00:43.904 --> 00:45.087
Uh...
No, it's all right.

00:45.105 --> 00:46.372
No, guys, guys.

00:46.407 --> 00:48.258
I will take a chill pill, I will.

00:48.292 --> 00:49.993
Because I have
a congenital heart condition,

00:50.027 --> 00:51.377
and I take them every day.

00:51.412 --> 00:53.830
I had shingles once.
I have a cut on my leg.

00:53.864 --> 00:55.365
Those things aren't congenital.

00:55.399 --> 00:56.933
(school bell ringing)
Show's over.

00:56.967 --> 00:59.502
We got to get our congenitals to class.

00:59.536 --> 01:01.704
(door bell dings)
Hi, Lin.

01:01.739 --> 01:02.822
Hey, Gretchen.

01:02.856 --> 01:04.107
Just came by to return this bottle

01:04.141 --> 01:05.541
of water you left at the salon.

01:05.576 --> 01:06.926
When did I leave that there?

01:06.961 --> 01:08.394
Two weeks ago.
Oh.

01:08.429 --> 01:10.229
Hey, do you guys have a lost and found?

01:10.264 --> 01:11.731
Yeah. Why?
What'd you lose?

01:11.765 --> 01:13.666
15 pounds. Look at me.

01:13.717 --> 01:15.685
Oh, yeah, you lost weight.

01:15.719 --> 01:17.220
Good for you.

01:17.254 --> 01:19.589
Wow, what's your secret, Gretchen?

01:19.623 --> 01:21.190
I went on the Skin Deep diet.

01:21.225 --> 01:22.926
You can only eat fruits
and vegetable skins,

01:22.960 --> 01:24.727
and the weight just fell right off.

01:24.762 --> 01:27.563
One time, I accidentally
ate a banana peel,

01:27.598 --> 01:29.265
but I didn't look like you afterwards.

01:29.300 --> 01:31.100
(laughter)
Whoa.

01:31.135 --> 01:32.535
Humph, err...

01:32.569 --> 01:33.970
Well, I got to run.

01:34.004 --> 01:35.054
Hey, Gretchen.

01:35.089 --> 01:36.222
Wow, you look great.

01:36.256 --> 01:37.256
Did you lose weight?

01:37.291 --> 01:38.725
Little bit. Look--

01:38.759 --> 01:40.426
my tattoo's not stretched out anymore.

01:40.461 --> 01:43.229
It almost looks like a regular dolphin.
Wow, yeah.

01:43.263 --> 01:44.530
Look at my thigh tattoo, Bobby.

01:44.565 --> 01:45.798
Oh, let me pull my shorts up here.

01:45.833 --> 01:47.700
It's okay.
Okay. All right.

01:47.735 --> 01:50.053
Bye, Gretchen.
Bye, everybody.

01:50.087 --> 01:51.287
Bye.

01:51.322 --> 01:52.655
You're perfect the way you are.

01:52.690 --> 01:54.223
Don't lose one more pound.

01:54.258 --> 01:56.492
I won't, probably.
I don't know.

01:56.527 --> 01:57.777
(laughs)

01:57.811 --> 01:59.078
Gretchen looks good, huh?

01:59.113 --> 02:00.613
Yeah, I guess she looks all right.

02:00.648 --> 02:01.981
Why is your eye twitching?

02:02.016 --> 02:03.449
Because I'm very happy for her.

02:03.484 --> 02:04.968
So what if she's the hot one now,

02:05.002 --> 02:06.436
and I'm the one with the muffin top.

02:06.470 --> 02:08.170
Oh, come on, Lin, you look great.

02:08.205 --> 02:09.906
I like your muffin top.

02:09.940 --> 02:11.641
So you think I have a muffin top?
What?

02:11.675 --> 02:13.276
No, no, I said... No.

02:13.310 --> 02:15.611
I'm going on that diet, Bob,
and when I'm done,

02:15.646 --> 02:17.814
I'm gonna look like
Gretchen's skinny sister.

02:17.848 --> 02:19.415
Gretchen's sister is skinny, Lin,

02:19.450 --> 02:21.150
but it's because she's
on methamphetamines.

02:21.185 --> 02:23.319
Whatever works, Teddy.
Don't judge!

02:23.354 --> 02:25.405
(sucking, snorting)

02:25.439 --> 02:27.857
If you guys are trying to
cut the line, forget it.

02:27.891 --> 02:29.792
Lenny's giving us backwards cuts.

02:30.728 --> 02:31.794
Backwards cuts?

02:31.829 --> 02:33.029
They found a loophole.

02:33.063 --> 02:34.497
Hey, Gene, guess what?

02:34.531 --> 02:35.698
What, Rupa?

02:35.733 --> 02:37.200
I know someone who likes you.

02:37.234 --> 02:38.334
Is it Lenny?

02:38.369 --> 02:39.802
'Cause I want backwards cuts.

02:39.837 --> 02:41.537
I think she means someone
like-likes you.

02:41.572 --> 02:43.272
Uh-huh.
Oh.

02:43.307 --> 02:44.607
Is it the school nurse?

02:44.641 --> 02:46.109
She said I was the perfect temperature.

02:46.143 --> 02:47.477
Can't tell you.

02:47.511 --> 02:48.878
It's a secret.

02:48.912 --> 02:50.797
Aw, I guess we'll never know now.

02:50.831 --> 02:54.367
Well, whoever she is, I hope she
appreciates that I can do this.

02:54.401 --> 02:56.052
Ah, ah, baa, baa, ba.

02:56.070 --> 02:57.670
Dun dun da-dun-dun, baa-baa.

02:57.705 --> 02:59.221
I don't get it.
Bop. Bop.

02:59.239 --> 03:02.158
I try and try and he ends up
with the secret crush.

03:02.192 --> 03:04.327
Maybe don't try so hard, girlfriend.

03:04.361 --> 03:05.728
Okay, I see your point.

03:05.763 --> 03:07.847
Who do you think
like-likes Gene?

03:07.881 --> 03:09.615
"Puberty, puberty,
puberty."

03:09.650 --> 03:11.451
That's all I hear when you guys talk.

03:11.485 --> 03:12.652
But we're his sisters.

03:12.686 --> 03:14.153
What if we don't approve of her?

03:14.188 --> 03:15.838
Oh, judging people.

03:15.873 --> 03:17.306
Well, when you put it like that...

03:17.341 --> 03:20.409
Bad hair, bad breath, bad attitude,

03:20.427 --> 03:22.995
eyes, nose, mouth, posture...

03:23.030 --> 03:25.832
So, we know it's not
Sarah, Wendy or Lizzie.

03:25.866 --> 03:27.066
Maybe it's Julie?

03:27.101 --> 03:29.335
Nah, she like-likes
Lenny Destefano.

03:29.369 --> 03:31.637
Geez, who isn't
on the Lenny Destefano train.

03:31.672 --> 03:33.706
It sold out even
before it left the station.

03:33.741 --> 03:34.807
Uh-huh.
What about Rupa?

03:34.842 --> 03:36.375
Maybe she told us

03:36.410 --> 03:38.511
about the secret crush
to throw us off her trail?

03:38.545 --> 03:40.413
No. Rupa's not that smart.

03:40.447 --> 03:43.149
She thought elbow macaroni
was made of elbows.

03:43.183 --> 03:45.885
Oh, (forced laugh) and that's not true.

03:45.919 --> 03:47.887
Maybe it's someone
we're not thinking of.

03:47.921 --> 03:49.355
(both gasping)

03:49.389 --> 03:52.191
BOTH:
Courtney Wheeler!

03:52.226 --> 03:53.709
(both screaming)

03:53.744 --> 03:55.094
Hi, Gene.

03:55.129 --> 03:56.596
I heard somebody
like-likes you.

03:56.630 --> 03:58.014
Do you know who it is?

03:58.048 --> 03:59.882
Nope.
(screaming)

03:59.917 --> 04:01.084
She's in your grade,

04:01.118 --> 04:02.518
and she thinks you're really cute.

04:02.553 --> 04:03.503
And she has blond hair.

04:03.537 --> 04:05.054
And she's looking right at you.

04:05.089 --> 04:06.789
It's me!
(laughs, snorts)

04:06.824 --> 04:08.841
Oh, boy.
(screaming)

04:08.892 --> 04:10.510
So, do you
like-like Courtney?

04:10.544 --> 04:11.928
Do you want to go out with her?

04:11.962 --> 04:13.429
(screaming)

04:13.463 --> 04:15.214
Uh...

04:15.249 --> 04:16.516
(screaming)

04:16.567 --> 04:17.683
Uh...

04:17.718 --> 04:19.051
Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes.

04:19.086 --> 04:20.353
You like-like her, right?

04:20.387 --> 04:21.553
Yes.
Uh...

04:21.588 --> 04:22.522
(screaming)

04:22.556 --> 04:25.074
I guess?
(giggling, screaming)

04:25.109 --> 04:27.894
Oh, my God, I can't believe
he said yes, But he did.

04:27.928 --> 04:29.295
You guys are going out.

04:29.329 --> 04:30.696
Let's make it official.

04:30.731 --> 04:32.582
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
(screaming)

04:35.786 --> 04:38.037
Aw.

04:38.071 --> 04:40.089
Uh, is this forever?

04:40.124 --> 04:41.257
Oh right, I forgot.

04:41.291 --> 04:42.875
GENE:
Oh, no.

04:42.910 --> 04:44.327
There it is.

04:44.361 --> 04:47.263
It's all, eh,
written down. (snorts)

04:50.189 --> 04:51.816
Uh-huh, uh-huh.
All right.

04:51.936 --> 04:52.970
Well, thank you.

04:53.037 --> 04:54.838
Bog Harbor Catholic has an opening.

04:54.873 --> 04:57.274
You'll just need to wear a skirt
and go by the name Eugenia.

04:57.308 --> 04:58.475
Louise, what are you talking about?

04:58.510 --> 04:59.910
Gene's switching schools.

04:59.961 --> 05:02.012
Gene, why do you want to switch schools?

05:02.046 --> 05:03.247
(gasps) Are you being bullied?

05:03.281 --> 05:04.915
Who's hurting my baby boy?

05:04.949 --> 05:06.583
I wish I had a bully.

05:06.618 --> 05:07.918
This is way worse.

05:07.952 --> 05:09.486
Courtney Wheeler
like-likes him.

05:09.521 --> 05:11.989
Oh...!

05:12.023 --> 05:14.458
Courtney asked Gene if
he wanted to go out with her,

05:14.492 --> 05:15.826
and he said yes.

05:15.860 --> 05:17.194
All right, Gene, you're on the board.

05:17.228 --> 05:18.328
Way to go.

05:18.363 --> 05:20.163
I hear dating bells.

05:20.198 --> 05:21.932
So, who's Courtney?

05:21.966 --> 05:24.668
Courtney Wheeler is the most
annoying girl in my grade.

05:24.702 --> 05:26.453
In school.
In the world.

05:26.487 --> 05:28.188
Oh, well, what's so bad about her?

05:28.223 --> 05:29.806
She talks too much,
she breathes too loud,

05:29.841 --> 05:31.208
and she's always sucking
on her necklace.

05:31.242 --> 05:32.492
(slurping noises)

05:32.527 --> 05:34.194
And her breath smells like sweat.

05:34.229 --> 05:36.697
Yeah, and she talks on her phone
when she goes to the bathroom.

05:36.731 --> 05:37.965
It's confusing.

05:37.999 --> 05:39.166
COURTNEY:
Hey, how's it going?

05:39.200 --> 05:40.534
Good. Thanks for asking.

05:40.568 --> 05:42.035
I'm in the bathroom.
Where are you?

05:42.070 --> 05:43.337
I'm in the bathroom, too.

05:43.371 --> 05:44.638
I thought you knew that.

05:44.672 --> 05:45.973
Sorry, hold on.

05:46.007 --> 05:47.541
Some girl thinks I'm talking to her.

05:47.575 --> 05:49.243
Oh, well get rid of her.
I'll wait here.

05:49.277 --> 05:51.311
Gene, then why did you say
you'd go out with her?

05:51.346 --> 05:52.512
Her friends were staring at me!

05:52.547 --> 05:54.381
I didn't want to be a jerk, Dad.

05:54.415 --> 05:56.350
Well, you're not being a jerk
if you don't like her.

05:56.384 --> 05:58.018
Like-like her.
Like-like her.

05:58.052 --> 05:59.586
Your father's right, Gene.

05:59.621 --> 06:02.222
When did Mom start eating garbage?

06:02.257 --> 06:03.390
These are potato peels.

06:03.424 --> 06:05.092
I'm on the Skin Deep diet.

06:05.126 --> 06:06.894
I'm only allowed to eat
fruit and vegetable skins.

06:06.928 --> 06:08.328
It's delicious.

06:08.363 --> 06:09.930
You know, the longer you wait,
the harder

06:09.964 --> 06:11.665
it's gonna be to tell her
how you really feel.

06:11.699 --> 06:12.766
Oh, yeah?
When are you gonna

06:12.800 --> 06:14.935
tell Mom how you really feel?

06:14.969 --> 06:16.403
LINDA: Huh? Huh?
What'd he say?

06:17.939 --> 06:19.323
Hi, Gene.

06:19.357 --> 06:21.742
Hi, Courtney.
BOTH: Aww. So cute.

06:21.776 --> 06:23.443
We're walking into school together.

06:23.478 --> 06:25.412
'Cause, you know, now we're going out.

06:25.446 --> 06:26.847
Take my hand.

06:26.881 --> 06:28.715
You should know
when you hold hands with me,

06:28.750 --> 06:31.018
you hold hands
with everything I've ever eaten.

06:31.052 --> 06:32.352
I don't care if they're sticky.

06:32.387 --> 06:34.221
Just makes them harder to pull apart.

06:34.255 --> 06:36.456
(anxious whimpering)

06:36.491 --> 06:37.791
BOTH:
So cute.

06:37.825 --> 06:39.059
Unbelievable.

06:39.093 --> 06:40.260
You guys, we're going in.

06:40.295 --> 06:42.062
Yech!

06:42.096 --> 06:44.865
Do you know where to hit me
on my head to give me amnesia?

06:44.899 --> 06:46.233
Right here. Who am I?

06:46.267 --> 06:47.567
Tina, try again.

06:47.602 --> 06:48.769
Who am I?

06:48.803 --> 06:49.937
Tina, try again.

06:49.971 --> 06:51.071
Who am I?

06:51.105 --> 06:53.073
Tina, harder!

You sure?

07:28.338 --> 07:29.226
I earned it.

07:29.260 --> 07:31.128
All I had for breakfast was kiwi fuzz.

07:31.162 --> 07:32.896
It was like licking
your father's back. Ugh.

07:32.930 --> 07:33.897
Thanks, Lin.
What?

07:33.931 --> 07:35.348
Gene, let me get this straight.

07:35.366 --> 07:37.117
I'm driving you on a date with a girl

07:37.151 --> 07:39.319
who you don't like and should've
broken up with by now?

07:39.354 --> 07:40.921
Like-like.
Tina, I know.

07:40.955 --> 07:42.356
Actually, it's a double date.

07:42.390 --> 07:43.924
Julie and Lenny Destefano are coming.

07:43.958 --> 07:45.826
Julie better not get
too attached to Lenny.

07:45.860 --> 07:47.978
That is one stallion
that won't be broken.

07:48.012 --> 07:49.813
Here, Dad, you'll
probably need ear plugs.

07:49.847 --> 07:51.198
And if those aren't enough,

07:51.232 --> 07:53.100
hit yourself over the head with this.

07:53.134 --> 07:55.085
I'm sure she's not that bad, Louise.

07:55.119 --> 07:57.120
Hmm... she kind of is.
Ehh... you would be wrong.

07:57.155 --> 07:58.822
Prepare to be surprised.

07:58.856 --> 08:00.323
Dad, take it, take it.

08:00.358 --> 08:01.958
I don't even need it back, just take it.

08:01.993 --> 08:04.094
Good-bye.
All right, well, good luck finding

08:04.128 --> 08:06.430

Courtney, will you
stop kicking the seat?

08:10.852 --> 08:12.652
I'm not kicking. Kick.

08:12.687 --> 08:13.820
Really?
I can feel it.

08:13.855 --> 08:14.888
And you're saying kick.

08:14.906 --> 08:16.857
No. It's not me. Kick.

08:16.891 --> 08:18.108
Well, Julie's too far away.

08:18.159 --> 08:19.359
And it's not Lenny.

08:19.393 --> 08:21.445
Not me, Mr. B.
Oh, I know, Lenny.

08:21.496 --> 08:23.146
Maybe you're just
imagining it. Kick.

08:23.181 --> 08:24.498
Did you feel that?

08:24.532 --> 08:25.866
Yes.
Kick.

08:25.900 --> 08:27.200
How about that?

08:27.234 --> 08:28.485
Courtney, please.

08:28.519 --> 08:29.853
Courtney can't control her legs

08:29.887 --> 08:31.838
because she has
a congenital heart condition.

08:31.873 --> 08:33.789
What do those things have
to do with each other?

08:33.841 --> 08:35.792

to do with each other? (grunts)

08:35.842 --> 08:37.260
Oh, my God.

08:39.230 --> 08:41.364
(whispering): Gene.
What?

08:41.399 --> 08:42.999
She's so annoying.
I know.

08:43.034 --> 08:45.202
You have to break up with her.
I know.

08:45.236 --> 08:46.970
Get back in the car.
We can drive away.

08:47.004 --> 08:48.839
Seriously?
I think so.

08:48.873 --> 08:50.741
Forget it, forget it.
It's too late. Here she comes.

08:50.775 --> 08:52.309
I don't know how
to break up with her, Dad.

08:52.360 --> 08:53.493
Just.... Oh hi, Courtney.

08:53.528 --> 08:54.661
We were just talking.

08:54.695 --> 08:55.862
Just chatting.

08:55.897 --> 08:57.364
Come on, Gene, let's go, come on!

08:57.398 --> 08:58.932
I just want to finish
these chats with Dad.

08:58.966 --> 09:01.435
Dad, I just want to chat
with you some more.

09:01.469 --> 09:03.170
We have to go get seats in the back row

09:03.204 --> 09:04.504
'cause people complain
about the way I chew

09:04.539 --> 09:06.857

Gene, I'm so sorry.

09:08.459 --> 09:10.026
I want to break up with Courtney,

09:10.061 --> 09:12.062
but it's so hard.

09:12.096 --> 09:15.165
My life is more difficult than
anyone else's on the planet,

09:15.199 --> 09:18.602
and, yes, I'm including
starving children, so don't ask.

09:18.636 --> 09:19.886
Why don't we practice?

09:19.921 --> 09:21.088
Tina, you be Courtney.

09:21.122 --> 09:22.255
Gene, break up with her.

09:22.290 --> 09:23.907
Go ahead, you can do it.

09:23.941 --> 09:26.076
Courtney, I think we should break up.

09:26.110 --> 09:27.711
Oh, okay.

09:27.745 --> 09:28.912
Please don't be sad.

09:28.946 --> 09:30.080
No, I get it.

09:30.114 --> 09:31.214
It's fine.

09:31.249 --> 09:32.516
It wouldn't have worked anyway.

09:32.550 --> 09:34.634
This is so hard!
Can't I just wait

09:34.669 --> 09:37.070
till we go to different colleges
and lose touch?

09:37.105 --> 09:38.371
You're doing good.
You're doing good.

09:38.406 --> 09:39.739
Come on, try it with me.

09:39.774 --> 09:41.541
Courtney, I think we should break up.

09:41.576 --> 09:44.044
What?! You'll never
break up with me!

10:06.968 --> 10:08.235

10:08.269 --> 10:09.336
Okay, bye.

10:09.370 --> 10:10.637
Hold on, wait a second.

10:10.671 --> 10:12.305
I'm kidding.
That was a joke.

10:12.340 --> 10:15.075
What can I do for you?
Is Courtney home?

Who's asking?
I'm Gene.

Nah.

17:05.731 --> 17:06.737
You were right, Dad.

17:06.871 --> 17:08.965

Courtney a long time ago.

Yeah, honey, she'll be okay.

17:13.481 --> 17:14.446
Probably.

17:14.482 --> 17:16.031
Look at the bright side:

17:16.067 --> 17:17.968
You'll never have to go out
with any girls again,

17:18.002 --> 17:19.301

Gene, Doug wasn't gonna
give you a record deal.

17:28.229 --> 17:29.629
He doesn't even give out record deals.

17:29.664 --> 17:30.947

No, he doesn't.

17:45.229 --> 17:46.396
Now's the time.

17:46.430 --> 17:48.164
Dad, what do I say to her?

17:48.199 --> 17:49.699
(high-pitched):
Just make light small talk.

17:49.734 --> 17:50.800
Yeah, cheer her up.

17:50.835 --> 17:52.335
Make some fart noises, huh?

17:52.370 --> 17:53.904
I don't think I have it in me.

those things that you said?

18:21.799 --> 18:23.166
No!

18:23.200 --> 18:24.267
Well, a little bit.

18:24.302 --> 18:25.402
I'm sorry.

18:25.436 --> 18:28.672
So, you don't like-like me?

18:28.706 --> 18:32.008
No, but... I like
things about you.

18:32.043 --> 18:33.710
Like your dad and his stuff.

18:33.744 --> 18:34.578
(groans weakly)

18:34.612 --> 18:37.013
You were using me.

18:37.048 --> 18:38.882
I prefer the term
"networking."

18:38.916 --> 18:42.452
Gene, if you're gonna break up
with me, break up with me.

18:42.486 --> 18:43.553
I can take it.

18:43.588 --> 18:45.622

18:53.881 --> 18:55.081
There's nothing we can do.

18:55.116 --> 18:56.549
You broke her heart.

19:05.810 --> 19:07.043
Yeah.

19:07.078 --> 19:08.078

19:08.112 --> 19:09.746
No.

19:09.780 --> 19:11.414

but we stabilized her.

19:11.448 --> 19:12.415
Thanks, Dr. Chegler.

19:12.450 --> 19:13.717
Oh, you're welcome.

19:13.751 --> 19:15.885
You should've seen your face.

19:15.920 --> 19:17.137
Did you see his face?

19:17.171 --> 19:18.238
It was very funny.

19:18.272 --> 19:19.789
You scared me!

19:19.807 --> 19:21.725
I think you kind of deserved it,

19:21.759 --> 19:23.059
after what you did to me.

19:23.094 --> 19:24.728
I guess you're right.

19:24.762 --> 19:26.496
It's okay.
I'll forgive you.

19:26.530 --> 19:29.265

to go out with me.

19:29.300 --> 19:30.934
Peter's got partial hearing loss.

19:30.968 --> 19:32.152

Nope. Not a chance
