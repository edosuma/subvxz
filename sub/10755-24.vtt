00:10.051 --> 00:15.706
This is Dr. Frasier Crane, 
wishing you all good mental health.

00:15.706 --> 00:16.560
Happy anniversary!

00:16.560 --> 00:18.751
Oh, Roz!  Oh, this is so much fun, Roz!

00:18.751 --> 00:19.648
I got you one too!

00:19.648 --> 00:23.682
Oh, thank you!  O.K., you first.

00:23.682 --> 00:25.066
I mean, it's nothing really,

00:25.066 --> 00:27.170
it's not expensive or anything, 
you probably won't even like it,

00:27.170 --> 00:28.163
I'm not good with gifts?

00:28.163 --> 00:31.985
Look, don't oversell it, Roz.

00:31.985 --> 00:36.017
It's a tape.

00:36.017 --> 00:44.362
"The Dr. Frasier Crane Show: 
Show #1, May 21st, 1993."

00:44.362 --> 00:45.273
It's our first broadcast.

00:45.273 --> 00:46.584
Oh, Roz!

00:46.584 --> 00:49.107
I can't wait to listen to it!

00:49.107 --> 00:50.666
Did you ever think I'd stay on 
the air this long?

00:50.666 --> 00:55.154
Oh, hell no.

00:55.154 --> 00:57.960
"To Roz, who believed in me from the start."

00:57.960 --> 01:04.599
Yes, it's from Hallmark's "Irony" section.

01:04.599 --> 01:07.780
Oh, Frasier, they're beautiful!

01:07.780 --> 01:08.771
Earrings!

01:08.771 --> 01:10.305
Thank you, thank you!

01:10.305 --> 01:11.156
You deserve them.

01:11.156 --> 01:12.529
Working side by side for three years,

01:12.529 --> 01:14.787
one can't help but become close friends.

01:14.787 --> 01:15.808
And they're blue!

01:15.808 --> 01:23.546
To match your... lips when they're cold!

01:23.546 --> 01:26.964
Oh, Mum, it's not that I don't want to come home.

01:26.964 --> 01:28.450
I'd love a visit!

01:28.450 --> 01:30.283
It's just that I can't!

01:30.283 --> 01:31.649
He won't let me.

01:31.649 --> 01:35.297
Oh, you have no idea what Dr. Crane is like.

01:35.297 --> 01:42.573
Why, he's an absolute beast 
unpleasant to be around, a real tyrant!

01:42.573 --> 01:42.864
Oh!

01:42.864 --> 01:43.752
It's just my mum.

01:43.752 --> 01:45.442
I'm trying to get out of a visit home.

01:45.442 --> 01:47.314
Oh, I understand.

01:47.314 --> 01:48.545
All right.

01:48.545 --> 01:51.065
No, I'm not exaggerating!

01:51.065 --> 01:52.760
He treats me like a bloody slave!

01:52.760 --> 01:57.984
Daphne!  Where's my dressing gown?!

01:57.984 --> 01:59.632
Not to mention how cheap he is!

01:59.632 --> 02:03.016
That better not be a long-distance call!

02:03.016 --> 02:04.528
Yeah, yeah.

02:04.528 --> 02:10.336
He does sound a lot like Aunt Lillian.

02:10.336 --> 02:12.148
I got to run, Mum.

02:12.148 --> 02:13.351
Love you, bye.

02:13.351 --> 02:15.696
I'm sorry, you must think 
I'm a terrible daughter.

02:15.696 --> 02:16.282
No, not at all.

02:16.282 --> 02:18.118
I think you're a terrible liar, Daphne,

02:18.118 --> 02:20.891
but a perfectly run-of-the-mill daughter.

02:20.891 --> 02:23.138
It's just that I only get one vacation a year,

02:23.138 --> 02:25.931
and I want to go somewhere fun, like Acapulco.

02:25.931 --> 02:27.706
Well, that makes sense.

02:27.706 --> 02:30.247
And going home is just so flipping boring.

02:30.247 --> 02:31.931
It's always the same.

02:31.931 --> 02:35.146
There's a wonderful reunion at the airport,

02:35.146 --> 02:38.347
and we share all our news on the way home in the car.

02:38.347 --> 02:40.191
And by the time I've dropped off my suitcase,

02:40.191 --> 02:42.877
we've exhausted all conversation,

02:42.877 --> 02:46.386
and that's when I realize I've got 
a whole week left with nothing

02:46.386 --> 02:48.285
to look forward to but Dad telling

02:48.285 --> 02:51.718
the story of how he once shared 
a cigar with Winston Churchill

02:51.718 --> 02:56.069
during the blackouts ?he thinks!

02:56.069 --> 02:58.430
Well, it sounds like an easy decision, Daphne ?

02:58.430 --> 03:01.139
Hasta luego.

03:01.139 --> 03:05.668
Oh, Dr. Crane, why is it so easy 
to love our families,

03:05.668 --> 03:08.171
yet so hard to like them?

03:08.171 --> 03:10.167
Well, Daphne, that is one of those questions

03:10.167 --> 03:16.798
that make life so rich... 
and psychiatrists richer.

03:16.798 --> 03:19.578
Yeah, well, maybe I'll just go call a travel agent,

03:19.578 --> 03:28.908
see which guilt trip is more expensive.

03:28.908 --> 03:31.187
Good afternoon, Seattle.

03:31.187 --> 03:35.116
My name is Dr. Frasier Crane.

03:35.116 --> 03:38.485
If you can feel, I can heal.

03:38.485 --> 03:39.846
Fasten your seat belt, Eddie.

03:39.846 --> 04:33.912
It's going to be a bumpy ride.

04:33.912 --> 04:35.178
Hello.

04:35.178 --> 04:39.329
You're on the air with Dr. Frasier Crane.

04:39.329 --> 05:03.234
"Put your head in my hands."

05:03.234 --> 05:05.473
"Little owlet in the glen, I am ashamed of you,

05:05.473 --> 05:07.227
You are ungrammatical in speaking as you do,

05:07.227 --> 05:09.697
You should say, 'to whom, 
to whom,' not 'to who, to who.'

05:09.697 --> 05:12.360
Your little friend, Miss Katydid, 
may be green, 'tis true,

05:12.360 --> 05:13.594
But you never heard her say?

05:13.594 --> 05:16.241
Who the hell are you?

05:16.241 --> 05:17.737
I'm Roz Doyle, your new producer.

05:17.737 --> 05:18.667
What?  Producer?

05:18.667 --> 05:19.712
Dr. Crane, I presume?

05:19.712 --> 05:20.681
Yes, yes, but, uh, where's Dave?

05:20.681 --> 05:21.692
Uh, he got another assignment.

05:21.692 --> 05:25.385
But I was comfortable with Dave.

05:25.385 --> 05:27.378
Look, Dr. Crane, I know you've 
been thrown a curve,

05:27.378 --> 05:28.538
but everything's gonna be fine.

05:28.538 --> 05:29.920
But I did a mock show with Dave.

05:29.920 --> 05:32.811
I did mock-call-in's, mock commercials, 
mock news bulletins!

05:32.811 --> 05:36.378
Look, I got a bulletin for you: Dave's out, I'm in,

05:36.378 --> 05:39.058
and stop saying "mock."

05:39.058 --> 05:40.257
All right, look, Miss Doyle,

05:40.257 --> 05:41.793
I'm sure you're quite capable,

05:41.793 --> 05:43.328
but Dave has fifteen years of experience.

05:43.328 --> 05:45.334
I'd really prefer that he do it.

05:45.334 --> 05:47.714
Well, that would make two of us then, wouldn't it?

05:47.714 --> 05:52.136
I really think I should call 
management and ask for Dave,

05:52.136 --> 05:54.990
it's not really fair to Dave or to me.

05:54.990 --> 05:59.227
Dr. Crane, Dave dumped you.

05:59.227 --> 06:06.537
Why?

06:06.537 --> 06:08.734
We were here until 2 A.M. this morning,

06:08.734 --> 06:11.838
as I explained to Dave in meticulous
detail my philosophy of

06:11.838 --> 06:13.623
optimal mental health!

06:13.623 --> 06:17.184
It's a mystery, all right.

06:17.184 --> 06:19.046
O.K., look, I'm going to screen a few calls, and

06:19.046 --> 06:21.132
No!  No, no, as I explained to Dave before,

06:21.132 --> 06:22.063
there will be no call-screening.

06:22.063 --> 06:24.195
You see, I want my show to be 
fresh and spontaneous,

06:24.195 --> 06:25.892
and call screening squelches all of that.

06:25.892 --> 06:29.933
And the mystery of Dave's departure deepens.

06:29.933 --> 06:44.918
OK, you're on in five seconds, I'll give you a cue.

06:44.918 --> 06:48.519
Good afternoon, Seattle.

06:48.519 --> 06:53.120
My name is Dr. Frasier Crane.

06:53.120 --> 07:02.689
"If you can feel, I can heal."

07:02.689 --> 07:04.726
Let's see who's on line one!

07:04.726 --> 07:06.969
Hello, this is Dr. Frasier Crane.

07:06.969 --> 07:09.991
"You're on the couch."

07:09.991 --> 07:12.096
No, I'm not.

07:12.096 --> 07:14.600
Well, I meant on the metaphorical couch.

07:14.600 --> 07:18.989
I'm in a beanbag chair, O.K.?

07:18.989 --> 07:23.596
Uh, moving on then, um, how can I help you?

07:23.596 --> 07:25.364
It's about my husband...

07:25.364 --> 07:28.393
Look, I-I just can't do this, it's 
really too embarrassing for me.

07:28.393 --> 07:29.933
No, no, please, please, dear friend,

07:29.933 --> 07:31.735
you must - I'm really here to help you.

07:31.735 --> 07:46.549
Please, go ahead.

07:46.549 --> 07:47.788
...I've tried, and I've tried,

07:47.788 --> 07:51.861
and I just don't know what to do about this!

07:51.861 --> 07:53.581
Well, you know, often in these cases,

07:53.581 --> 07:55.980
it helps if you restate your problem.

07:55.980 --> 08:00.103
But this time, try boiling it down 
to one succinct sentence.

08:00.103 --> 08:01.740
Now, how would you do that?

08:01.740 --> 08:06.174
My husband is dead!

08:06.174 --> 08:11.640
Well, perhaps we should go back 
to the wordy version.

08:11.640 --> 08:17.021
Uh, we'll be right back after 
these Important messages.

08:17.021 --> 08:19.429
Of course I could do a gardening show.

08:19.429 --> 08:21.479
If I can grow plants in my dorm room closet,

08:21.479 --> 08:26.380
I must know a thing or two about horticulture?

08:26.380 --> 08:28.660
Are you trying to get transferred?

08:28.660 --> 08:29.726
Bye!

08:29.726 --> 08:32.773
Look, Dr. Crane, I got to be honest with you here.

08:32.773 --> 08:37.073
It's just that I-I think psychiatry is, just, uh,

08:37.073 --> 08:40.700
sort of - kind of... bull!

08:40.700 --> 08:42.676
Oh, well, this is a match made 
in heaven then, isn't it?!

08:42.676 --> 08:43.719
Oh, don't be offended.

08:43.719 --> 08:44.709
"Don't be offended."

08:44.709 --> 08:46.036
Why should I be offended?

08:46.036 --> 08:48.391
In the last week, I've uprooted 
myself from my home of fifteen years,

08:48.391 --> 08:50.313
moved all the way across the 
country away from everything

08:50.313 --> 08:53.856
I care about, and plunged myself 
into a frightening new career!

08:53.856 --> 08:56.040
The first few nerve-wracking moments, I walk in

08:56.040 --> 08:58.275
here and find my producer lobbying to get herself

08:58.275 --> 09:00.192
transferred to another show!

09:00.192 --> 09:02.264
Abe Lincoln had a brighter future

09:02.264 --> 09:21.138
when he picked up his tickets at the box office!

09:21.138 --> 09:23.088
O.K., you got to make the caller get to the point,

09:23.088 --> 09:25.545
and then for God's sake, so should you.

09:25.545 --> 09:28.310
Duly noted.

09:28.310 --> 09:32.144
O.K.  Number twenty-four...

09:32.144 --> 09:32.784
You know what,

09:32.784 --> 09:34.609
you're starting to glaze.

09:34.609 --> 09:37.010
We can go through the rest of this tomorrow.

09:37.010 --> 09:37.770
See you, Frasier.

09:37.770 --> 09:41.648
Bye, Roz.

09:41.648 --> 09:42.328
Oh, excuse me.

09:42.328 --> 09:45.528
Well, excuse you.

09:45.528 --> 09:47.562
Oh, Niles!

09:47.562 --> 09:48.821
Oh, Frasier!

09:48.821 --> 09:49.923
What a serendipitous event.

09:49.923 --> 09:51.913
How did you discover my favorite coffee bar?

09:51.913 --> 09:53.922
Well, the radio station's right across the street.

09:53.922 --> 09:55.672
I did my first show today.

09:55.672 --> 09:57.705
Yes, you did, didn't you?

09:57.705 --> 10:05.032
Well... good to see you, have a nice day!

10:05.032 --> 10:07.127
Niles, aren't you going to join me?

10:07.127 --> 10:10.662
Oh, well, I would, but I have a routine.

10:10.662 --> 10:12.174
I come in every day, order coffee

10:12.174 --> 10:16.694
and spend some quality time... 
with myself, you understand.

10:16.694 --> 10:21.473
Niles, I've seen you once in the last two years.

10:21.473 --> 10:24.792
Oh, that is your point.

10:24.792 --> 10:26.936
Well... very well, in the spirit of

10:26.936 --> 10:40.437
blood being thicker than water, why don't we?

10:40.437 --> 10:41.913
I remember your fourth birthday party.

10:41.913 --> 10:46.360
Grandmother took us to the park 
to ride the carousel,

10:46.360 --> 10:47.815
and made all those little children

10:47.815 --> 10:51.916
wait while you wiped off your painted pony.

10:51.916 --> 10:53.167
I was wearing Bermuda shorts and

10:53.167 --> 11:01.469
that saddle was slick with toddler sweat.

11:01.469 --> 11:04.893
Well, uh... oh, uh, thanks again for

11:04.893 --> 11:09.149
dinner the other night with Maris.

11:09.149 --> 11:10.480
You two seem very happy.

11:10.480 --> 11:12.351
Oh yes, it's love.

11:12.351 --> 11:17.726
Like the Arctic Puffin, we've mated for life.

11:17.726 --> 11:21.053
Honestly, I can't imagine even 
looking at another woman.

11:21.053 --> 11:31.830
Excuse me, sir, have you finished with that sugar?

11:31.830 --> 11:32.645
Oh, yes.You ready to order?

11:32.645 --> 11:33.126
Uh, yes.

11:33.126 --> 11:34.987
Double decaf non-fat latte,

11:34.987 --> 11:37.085
mmm... medium foam,

11:37.085 --> 11:41.005
dusted with just the faintest whisper of cinnamon.

11:41.005 --> 11:45.235
I'll have a black coffee.

11:45.235 --> 11:46.324
You'll have to forgive my brother.

11:46.324 --> 11:50.628
He just came in on the noon stage.

11:50.628 --> 11:54.472
I hope I never see the day when 
I am so frightfully pretentious

11:54.472 --> 12:04.283
that a good-old cup of American 
coffee isn't good enough for me.

12:04.283 --> 12:08.174
So, how'd your visit with Dad go?

12:08.174 --> 12:10.152
I haven't been to see him yet.

12:10.152 --> 12:11.419
Really?

12:11.419 --> 12:12.375
You've been in town a whole week.

12:12.375 --> 12:13.642
Well, I've been very busy,

12:13.642 --> 12:16.279
what with settling into the 
new apartment, unpacking...

12:16.279 --> 12:17.686
Frasier, you're obviously making excuses.

12:17.686 --> 12:19.424
I'm going over tonight for my weekly visit,

12:19.424 --> 12:22.170
why don't you come along?

12:22.170 --> 12:24.034
Geez, I know I should, Niles.

12:24.034 --> 12:25.487
But I'm really in such a vulnerable state right now.

12:25.487 --> 12:30.393
The last thing I need is Seattle's 
reigning sourpuss taking potshots at me.

12:30.393 --> 12:31.938
Is that what you're worried about?

12:31.938 --> 12:32.755
Yes!

12:32.755 --> 12:34.559
Well, you have been out of touch.

12:34.559 --> 12:36.144
Our father's a changed man.

12:36.144 --> 12:40.514
Ever since he was shot, he's softened,
with a whole new zest for life!

12:40.514 --> 12:42.362
Niles, I visited him in the hospital.

12:42.362 --> 12:47.146
He made his roommate cry, and the man was in a coma.

12:47.146 --> 12:48.241
Dad was still in shock.

12:48.241 --> 12:49.775
The change came after.

12:49.775 --> 12:51.310
As a psychiatrist surely you've seen this?

12:51.310 --> 12:54.281
A patient has a brush with death and 
rediscovers his love of life.

12:54.281 --> 12:56.886
Ah,

12:56.886 --> 12:59.100
the laughs we've had when I'm over there.

12:59.100 --> 13:03.603
I sometimes wonder if that bullet 
didn't crease his funny bone.

13:03.603 --> 13:06.883
Oh... thank you.

13:06.883 --> 13:09.289
Can you believe the incompetence of that man?

13:09.289 --> 13:11.240
I very clearly asked for a whisper of cinnamon,

13:11.240 --> 13:14.697
he's given me a full-throated shout!

13:14.697 --> 13:24.329
There are countries in this world 
where they would lop off his sprinkling hand!

13:24.329 --> 13:32.812
You know, I'd forgotten what a weird 
little person you are.

13:32.812 --> 13:35.248
Dad is going to be positively giddy 
when he sees that he's got

13:35.248 --> 13:39.080
the both of us tonight.

13:39.080 --> 13:40.176
Who is it?

13:40.176 --> 13:42.339
Niles, and a special guest!

13:42.339 --> 13:46.537
Oh, jeez... all right,

13:46.537 --> 13:47.530
hold your horses.

13:47.530 --> 13:51.370
How does he come up with those?

13:51.370 --> 13:53.145
Look, Dad, it's Frasier!

13:53.145 --> 13:54.036
Well, I can see that.

13:54.036 --> 13:55.833
That punk didn't shoot out my eyeball.

13:55.833 --> 14:00.321
Stop it!

14:00.321 --> 14:02.820
He sees the humor in everything.

14:02.820 --> 14:04.673
Frasier, come on in.

14:04.673 --> 14:10.697
Thanks, Dad.

14:10.697 --> 14:11.938
So, big game?

14:11.938 --> 14:13.411
Nah, they're losing again.

14:13.411 --> 14:14.372
Pitcher's a bum.

14:14.372 --> 14:21.279
He's a bum, he's an absolute hobo!

14:21.279 --> 14:23.575
Isn't that right, Skipper?

14:23.575 --> 14:26.840
Niles, are you drunk?

14:26.840 --> 14:27.931
Don't be ridiculous!

14:27.931 --> 14:30.936
Seeing the three of us back together
again in the same room

14:30.936 --> 14:31.819
who needs alcohol for that?

14:31.819 --> 14:32.281
I do.

14:32.281 --> 14:34.799
I do.

14:34.799 --> 14:36.542
I'll get you a beer.

14:36.542 --> 14:41.935
Thanks, Dad.

14:41.935 --> 14:43.321
You filthy liar!

14:43.321 --> 14:44.514
You said he'd changed!

14:44.514 --> 14:47.226
Well, it got you here, didn't it?

14:47.226 --> 14:49.666
I've been dealing with him all by 
myself ever since Mom died.

14:49.666 --> 14:53.720
Now it's your turn, so welcome home, prodigal son!

14:53.720 --> 14:55.958
You guys want some pork rinds?

14:55.958 --> 15:00.841
And that's as close as you're going
to get to a fatted calf.

15:00.841 --> 15:03.919
No, thanks, Dad.

15:03.919 --> 15:06.830
Oh, will you stop staring at me?

15:06.830 --> 15:07.586
Here you go.

15:07.586 --> 15:09.759
Ah, well, I understand completely, Frasier.

15:09.759 --> 15:12.394
Dad, Frasier was just saying that he'd
like to spend some quality time with

15:12.394 --> 15:14.223
you alone, so I'm just going to slip out.

15:14.223 --> 15:15.279
All right, suit yourself.

15:15.279 --> 15:19.913
All right... oh, you haven't met Eddie.

15:19.913 --> 15:31.277
Eddie?  Frasier is the firstborn.

15:31.277 --> 15:40.279
The torch has been passed.

15:40.279 --> 15:42.175
So...

15:42.175 --> 15:44.644
How was your flight?

15:44.644 --> 15:54.320
Oh, actually, I drove.

15:54.320 --> 15:56.782
You take the I-Ninety?

15:56.782 --> 15:59.360
Uh, Eighty.

15:59.360 --> 16:03.055
Should have taken Ninety, it would
have got you here faster.

16:03.055 --> 16:13.444
Darn.  So, Dad, did you listen to my show today?

16:13.444 --> 16:14.358
No, I missed it.

16:14.358 --> 16:15.782
Sorry.

16:15.782 --> 16:17.407
That's all right.

16:17.407 --> 16:18.685
How'd it go?

16:18.685 --> 16:22.023
Well, uh, kind of rocky.

16:22.023 --> 16:25.766
Spent a good part of the day puzzling
over the proper signature line

16:25.766 --> 16:27.629
to use to introduce myself.

16:27.629 --> 16:29.022
Well, I'm sure you'll come up with something.

16:29.022 --> 16:30.622
Well, you know, I'm looking for 
something that's familiar

16:30.622 --> 16:33.182
but not a clich you know, 
something that's memorable

16:33.182 --> 16:36.148
but not too gimmicky...

16:36.148 --> 16:39.222
You know, it doesn't really matter 
if it's got something

16:39.222 --> 16:42.613
to ad, please, I'm trying to have 
a conversation, it's hard with the TV on.

16:42.613 --> 16:44.890
Well, I just want to get the score, O.K.?

16:44.890 --> 16:48.681
I'm trying to describe to you my 
dilemna with that phrase?

16:48.681 --> 16:50.138
All right, fine, I'm listening.

16:50.138 --> 16:52.384
Are you happy?  I'm listening.

16:52.384 --> 16:52.833
That's it!

16:52.833 --> 16:53.320
"I'm listening!"

16:53.320 --> 16:54.226
That's fabulous!

16:54.226 --> 16:55.363
Have you got a pencil somewhere?

16:55.363 --> 16:58.652
Yeah, there's one in the kitchen on the table.

16:58.652 --> 17:02.564
"I'm listening."  Dad - oh, I love that!

17:02.564 --> 17:05.498
Uh, look, I hate to cut this short, 
but I told some guys

17:05.498 --> 17:08.752
I'd meet 'em down at Duke's.

17:08.752 --> 17:09.664
You're leaving?

17:09.664 --> 17:10.121
Yeah.

17:10.121 --> 17:12.242
Whenever you're ready, I'll walk you out.

17:12.242 --> 17:13.537
Dad, I haven't seen you in two years,

17:13.537 --> 17:16.681
I stopped by and you're leaving in ten minutes?

17:16.681 --> 17:19.146
Oh, why don't we stop kidding ourselves?

17:19.146 --> 17:20.362
You don't really want to be here,

17:20.362 --> 17:24.387
and we don't really have anything to talk about.

17:24.387 --> 17:25.536
At least I'm making the effort.

17:25.536 --> 17:29.186
Oh, yeah ?it's an effort to talk to me, huh?

17:29.186 --> 17:32.601
Well, I guess that's why you only bother
coming home once a year at Christmas.

17:32.601 --> 17:35.138
Oh no, wait!  Sorry, I take that back.

17:35.138 --> 17:40.552
Last year you went to Arugalah, 
wherever the hell that is.

17:40.552 --> 17:42.539
Dad, you know you're painting an 
awfully bleak picture here.

17:42.539 --> 17:44.210
Ever since I moved to Boston, I've 
come home at least three

17:44.210 --> 17:46.240
or four times a year.

17:46.240 --> 17:48.577
It's just lately things got a little hectic,

17:48.577 --> 17:49.936
and I haven't been able to come home as often.

17:49.936 --> 17:58.847
Yeah... I noticed how busy you got 
after your mother died.

17:58.847 --> 18:02.543
But, what the hell, I didn't go visit
you in Boston either, did I?

18:02.543 --> 18:07.568
So, uh, why don't we just drop this?

18:07.568 --> 18:15.048
No.  The point is that we're here now, together.

18:15.048 --> 18:19.759
I don't want this night to end before 
we've at least tried to have

18:19.759 --> 18:22.496
one real conversation.

18:22.496 --> 18:23.387
Will you at least try, Dad?

18:23.387 --> 18:55.721
Will you just sit down with me for 
a while and let's try, please?

18:55.721 --> 19:06.264
So, uh, you know, I'd forgotten how 
much it really does rain here.

19:06.264 --> 19:10.640
You get used to it.

19:10.640 --> 19:11.730
Makes things green.

19:11.730 --> 19:44.974
Yeah... where would the old earth be without rain?

19:44.974 --> 19:55.741
My darling, I would have thought that 
old fascination would wear off by now.

19:55.741 --> 19:56.686
Well, hello, there!

19:56.686 --> 19:57.300
Hey!

19:57.300 --> 19:58.052
Oh, hey, guys.

19:58.052 --> 20:01.271
Frasier, Dad tells me you've been on 
the air three years today,

20:01.271 --> 20:03.467
so we'd like to take you out for a celebratory dinner.

20:03.467 --> 20:06.261
Well, thank you.  Dad, how did you know?

20:06.261 --> 20:09.301
Well, I heard that woman who called in.

20:09.301 --> 20:11.259
You listened to my show?

20:11.259 --> 20:13.391
Well, I sort of...

20:13.391 --> 20:16.309
I feel asleep during the Mariners' game...

20:16.309 --> 20:17.876
but when I woke up, you were on.

20:17.876 --> 20:19.187
And you didn't turn me off.

20:19.187 --> 20:21.507
I did not!

20:21.507 --> 20:23.181
I listened to you for ten minutes before

20:23.181 --> 20:27.310
I finally dozed off again.

20:27.310 --> 20:30.418
Faint praise, and yet it thunders in my ears!

20:30.418 --> 20:30.974
Hello, Dr. Crane.

20:30.974 --> 20:33.256
Hey, Daphne, we're going out to dinner.

20:33.256 --> 20:34.585
You want to join us?

20:34.585 --> 20:35.704
Oh, thanks, but no.

20:35.704 --> 20:39.103
I promised myself that tonight I'd decide  
what I'm doing on my vacation ?

20:39.103 --> 20:42.073
either home to the family or to sunny Acapulco.

20:42.073 --> 20:51.512
I may just squeeze into my bikini and 
let my hips make the decision.

20:51.512 --> 20:53.503
Of course, it would be more memorable 
if we celebrated at home, just for a?

20:53.503 --> 20:56.609
Let's go, let's go!

20:56.609 --> 20:58.641
Have a lovely time!

20:58.641 --> 20:59.745
Oh, fellas, hold the elevator for me.

20:59.745 --> 21:01.136
All right.

21:01.136 --> 21:02.592
Daphne?

21:02.592 --> 21:05.762
I was just thinking about our 
discussion earlier this afternoon,

21:05.762 --> 21:09.792
and I've decided to give you an extra week off.

21:09.792 --> 21:13.176
That way you can go to Manchester, and Acapulco.

21:13.176 --> 21:16.113
Oh, that's so sweet!

21:16.113 --> 21:18.638
You really must think I should go home.

21:18.638 --> 21:27.813
Well, I've just realized that being 
part of a family is really worth the effort.

21:27.813 --> 21:38.582
And very often the effort... means 
you'll need a week in Acapulco, so...

21:38.582 --> 21:39.711
Thank you, Dr. Crane.

21:39.711 --> 21:43.246
You're welcome.

21:43.246 --> 21:47.115
I guess if I try a little harder, it won't be so bad.

21:47.115 --> 21:49.813
Well, that's a good way of thinking.

21:49.813 --> 21:53.070
You know, things can get better.

21:53.070 --> 21:54.196
Hey, let's go!

21:54.196 --> 22:01.239
I got acid burning a hole in my stomach!

22:01.239 --> 22:11.419
Still... would you mind leaving 
those brochures of Acapulco out for me?

22:11.419 --> 22:12.394
