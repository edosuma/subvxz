WEBVTT

00:05.171 --> 00:08.207
(shoveling sound)
Dig!

00:08.274 --> 00:11.943
Move the shovel. Dig!

00:12.045 --> 00:13.989
Let's go!

00:14.014 --> 00:16.915
Dig!

00:16.983 --> 00:19.718
You said we weren't gonna kill anybody.

00:19.819 --> 00:22.021
Yeah. I lied.

00:22.088 --> 00:25.624
(gunshot)

00:30.764 --> 00:32.731
â™ª

00:34.701 --> 00:37.136
Try this.

00:37.237 --> 00:39.471
- What is it?
- Try it. It's smooth.

00:39.572 --> 00:42.674
Cheers.

00:45.311 --> 00:48.814
(coughing)
It's so smooth...

00:48.915 --> 00:50.382
So whatcha drinkin', sweetheart?

00:50.483 --> 00:53.752
Not interested.

00:53.820 --> 00:57.189
- Let her speak for herself.
- Maybe you misunderstood me.

00:57.257 --> 01:00.192
Not interested.

01:06.467 --> 01:08.411
I can handle that stuff myself.

01:08.435 --> 01:10.379
You know your dad wants me
to look out for you.

01:13.907 --> 01:16.075
I guess he's pretty busy right now.

01:16.142 --> 01:18.343
He really cares about you.

01:18.445 --> 01:20.646
Don't ever forget that.

01:26.219 --> 01:29.388
Hey. What's up?

01:29.489 --> 01:31.433
I... I think
I'm gonna go home.

01:31.458 --> 01:33.592
Can I have some money for a cab?
Sure.

01:36.729 --> 01:38.797
- Thanks.
- Could you

01:38.865 --> 01:41.700
stop by Mikey's, get me a carton
of cigarettes? I'm running low.

01:41.801 --> 01:45.370
- Yeah.
- OK. I shouldn't be too long.

01:45.472 --> 01:48.073
Maybe.

01:49.809 --> 01:52.177
All right. It's your shot.

01:57.317 --> 02:00.185
- Here you are, my dear.
- Thanks.

02:00.286 --> 02:02.721
Well, look at the beauty that
just walked into my store.

02:02.822 --> 02:04.623
Lucky me.
Hi, Mikey.

02:04.691 --> 02:07.392
- Your dad out of smokes?
- Yes.

02:07.460 --> 02:10.996
I got a couple unopened
cartons in the back.

02:11.097 --> 02:15.000
Oh... By the way...

02:15.101 --> 02:18.137
Did you hear about Greg Foster?

02:18.238 --> 02:21.006
No. What?

02:21.107 --> 02:23.575
He, uh... He made parole
He's gonna be out next week.

02:23.643 --> 02:26.678
That's three years early.

02:32.052 --> 02:33.996
That's not right.
Well, he wouldn't have been

02:34.020 --> 02:37.089
put away at all if it wasn't
for you. I'm grateful to ya.

02:37.157 --> 02:40.859
Chelsea.

02:40.960 --> 02:43.929
- Adam.
- I'll, uh... I'll just go

02:44.030 --> 02:45.974
get those cigarettes.
Nah, I can do it, Gramps.

02:45.999 --> 02:48.867
No, no, you stay and keep this
beautiful young lady company.

02:48.935 --> 02:50.969
(laughing)

02:54.140 --> 02:56.942
- Long time no see.
- And whose fault is that?

02:57.010 --> 03:00.512
I've been coming in here at least
once a week. I was just on break

03:00.565 --> 03:02.525
from school so I thought
I'd come help out Gramps.

03:02.549 --> 03:05.484
I can't believe you're even standing here.
Why is that?

03:05.552 --> 03:07.619
Well, I thought you'd be
in Berlin by now.

03:07.687 --> 03:11.323
Wasn't that what you planned to do, go see
where your mom was born and all that?

03:11.424 --> 03:14.159
Dusseldorf. Yeah.
I am gonna go soon.

03:14.227 --> 03:15.994
I have my whole... trip planned
out, actually. I just...

03:16.095 --> 03:18.039
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

03:18.064 --> 03:21.333
Here ya are, my dear.
(panting)

03:24.337 --> 03:27.072
You tell your dad to drop in
when he gets the chance, huh?

03:27.140 --> 03:30.776
I will. Thank you. I'll, um...

03:30.843 --> 03:33.912
I'll see you later.
Bye.

03:35.848 --> 03:38.750
She's a good girl, that one.
(laughing)

03:40.000 --> 03:46.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:47.894 --> 03:51.196
- Hurry up. Open that drawer! Get the cash in there.
- Take whatever you want.

03:51.297 --> 03:53.865
You're either gonna be very broke
or very dead. It's up to you.

03:53.967 --> 03:56.301
- Take it all.
- Hurry up! - Yes, yes.

04:10.650 --> 04:13.518
Greg?

04:18.124 --> 04:20.692
Go, go, go, go, go!

04:26.866 --> 04:29.034
(moaning in pain)
Oh my God!

04:29.135 --> 04:31.103
Mikey!

04:32.338 --> 04:35.540
OK... OK...

04:37.910 --> 04:40.812
- [911. What's your emergency?]
- Hi. I'm at Mikey's Food Mart

04:40.913 --> 04:43.448
on 16th Avenue. The store's been
robbed; The owner's been hurt.

04:43.549 --> 04:46.818
[I'm sending an ambulance. Did
you see who robbed the store?]

04:46.919 --> 04:49.755
Yeah. Yeah. I know him.
His name is Greg Foster.

04:49.856 --> 04:51.923
He... he got into a blue car
with some other guy.

04:52.025 --> 04:54.293
They turned left onto Purnell Avenue.

04:54.394 --> 04:57.763
OK. You're gonna be OK.
The ambulance is on its way, OK?

04:57.864 --> 05:00.932
(honking)

05:05.538 --> 05:09.241
I think a trip is the best way to
celebrate your tenth anniversary. Oh!

05:09.309 --> 05:12.411
Ryan and I love, love, love
Buenos Aires. It's called

05:12.478 --> 05:14.846
the Paris of South America.
Oh, my gosh! Although

05:14.947 --> 05:16.891
I think he actually preferred
Rio better.

05:16.949 --> 05:20.952
Where do you think you'll go?

05:21.020 --> 05:23.588
Mmm. We actually haven't
discussed that. Have we, honey?

05:23.656 --> 05:26.776
Well, no, I... It's impossible for either
of us to get any time off right now.

05:26.859 --> 05:29.094
- Yeah.
- She's six days week

05:29.195 --> 05:31.463
at the clinic and,
you know, I'm off at a...

05:31.564 --> 05:34.132
conference almost every weekend so...

05:36.803 --> 05:40.339
I am gonna go find
my husband. Mm.

05:40.440 --> 05:42.384
Night.

05:44.544 --> 05:48.347
Who's texting you?
Probably work.

05:48.448 --> 05:51.216
At nine-thirty
on a Saturday night?

05:51.284 --> 05:53.118
Well, it's six-thirty
in California.

05:53.186 --> 05:55.754
And some people do work on the weekend.

05:55.855 --> 05:59.191
Like you do.

05:59.292 --> 06:03.028
Be right back.

06:11.971 --> 06:15.173
(texting signal)

06:23.449 --> 06:26.985
(ding)

06:27.053 --> 06:29.121
(beeping)

06:39.031 --> 06:42.334
- What's going on?
- Ah, I don't know, Ang.

06:42.435 --> 06:44.703
Maybe I'm crazy.
K,

06:44.804 --> 06:48.240
we both know you're not.
What's going on?

06:48.307 --> 06:50.251
I think Jeff's having an affair.

06:50.309 --> 06:54.012
What?

06:54.113 --> 06:57.883
I haven't caught him...

06:57.950 --> 07:00.685
or anything like that but...

07:00.787 --> 07:03.355
I don't know. I just...
I know he is.

07:03.456 --> 07:05.724
- How?
- He's been acting weird

07:05.825 --> 07:09.294
and sneaky, and...

07:09.362 --> 07:11.329
He always has some excuse
to be out of town.

07:11.397 --> 07:13.341
- Did you ask him about it?
- I did.

07:13.366 --> 07:15.400
He just denies it
and then he... acts like

07:15.468 --> 07:18.203
I'm being overly sus...
Hey, honey, do we have any

07:18.271 --> 07:20.138
more of that South African...
Private

07:20.239 --> 07:24.009
conversation.
I'll ask the caterer.

07:24.110 --> 07:26.344
K, we'll continue
the conversation later.

07:26.446 --> 07:29.915
For now just play the happy wife, OK?

07:30.016 --> 07:32.617
Ang, I'm a vet, not a politician.

07:32.718 --> 07:35.153
And I'm a divorce
attorney. Trust me.

08:16.629 --> 08:18.730
Would you excuse us for a moment?

08:21.434 --> 08:24.035
I've, uh... I've got
something for you.

08:27.940 --> 08:32.110
Happy tenth anniversary.

08:32.211 --> 08:35.280
Jeff, I don't wanna do this here.

08:35.347 --> 08:37.292
Well, what's going on?

08:39.352 --> 08:41.486
Let's just do it at home.

08:46.058 --> 08:48.527
(sizzling sound)

09:00.640 --> 09:04.009
<i>Jeff, I'm gonna ask you this
one more time.</i>

09:04.076 --> 09:06.711
And I need an honest answer.
Just don't ask me

09:06.779 --> 09:08.647
again if I'm having an affair, please.

09:08.714 --> 09:11.249
- Are you?
- No!

09:12.985 --> 09:14.929
I am

09:14.954 --> 09:17.188
so sick of you lying.

09:17.256 --> 09:19.925
(sighing)

09:37.276 --> 09:39.711
(cell phone ringing)

09:44.850 --> 09:47.719
- Hey.
- Sorry I took so long to call.

09:47.820 --> 09:51.122
How are you?
[Um... I'm OK.]

09:51.190 --> 09:53.558
Hey, when can I see you again?

09:53.659 --> 09:56.027
I miss you.
[I miss you too.]

09:56.095 --> 09:59.397
How 'bout I get us a room
tomorrow night?

09:59.498 --> 10:01.967
The Randal Garden Inn downtown?

10:02.068 --> 10:05.537
We can... order room service,

10:05.605 --> 10:07.572
[snuggle up with a movie.]

10:07.640 --> 10:10.141
OK. What time?

10:10.209 --> 10:13.645
I won't get there till after five, but
you can check in as early as three.

10:13.713 --> 10:15.580
You know, after you get off
work if you want to.

10:15.681 --> 10:18.984
[OK. Sounds good.]

10:19.085 --> 10:21.453
- Love you.
- I love you too.

10:21.554 --> 10:23.688
Bye.

10:29.295 --> 10:31.396
(exhaling)

10:34.333 --> 10:36.901
(loud music)

10:42.808 --> 10:46.478
Cheers.

10:46.579 --> 10:48.523
You know, I see that bitch sometimes.

10:48.547 --> 10:51.182
The one that turned him in.
Doesn't she go to school

10:51.283 --> 10:53.351
with you?

10:53.452 --> 10:55.812
That ho-bag dropped out a few
months after his sentencing.

10:55.836 --> 10:58.690
You can thank me for that.
I did what I could

10:58.758 --> 11:01.359
to make her life hell. What?

11:01.427 --> 11:04.229
She deserved it for lying her
ass off about my brother.

11:04.330 --> 11:06.331
Greg just told me to keep tabs

11:06.432 --> 11:08.500
on her. Find out

11:08.567 --> 11:12.203
what she's doing, where she's
going. That kind of stuff.

11:12.271 --> 11:14.973
He told me not to touch her.

11:15.041 --> 11:18.209
Speaking of touching...
Let's go to your room.

11:23.149 --> 11:26.818
(coughing)

11:26.919 --> 11:29.988
(flushing)

11:30.089 --> 11:32.033
- Too much to drink?
- I don't know.

11:32.058 --> 11:35.960
It must have been the tequila.
Do not let Rascal talk you

11:36.062 --> 11:38.502
into drinking that stuff, all
right? It's gonna rot your guts.

11:38.597 --> 11:40.541
I feel

11:40.599 --> 11:44.402
like my guts are rotting.

11:44.470 --> 11:47.672
- You want some breakfast?
- I can make it.

11:47.740 --> 11:50.608
I got it, sweetie.
I might not be able

11:50.710 --> 11:54.279
to cook much, but eggs
I think I can handle.

11:54.346 --> 11:57.215
Got some good news. Joey swung

11:57.283 --> 11:59.350
by the bar last night after
you left. He's heading

11:59.418 --> 12:01.686
to Alaska for work;
Said I could go with him.

12:01.787 --> 12:04.656
- On the crab boat?
- It's a lot of money.

12:04.757 --> 12:07.559
How long?

12:07.660 --> 12:11.196
Couple of weeks.
Till the season's over.

12:11.297 --> 12:13.131
I leave in a few hours.

12:13.199 --> 12:16.067
It's so dangerous.

12:16.135 --> 12:18.837
Nah. Not if you know
what you're doing.

12:18.904 --> 12:20.972
Sure. I guess.

12:21.073 --> 12:23.942
Is everything OK?

12:25.979 --> 12:27.923
Greg Foster's getting out of prison.

12:27.947 --> 12:31.049
Mikey told me last night.

12:31.117 --> 12:33.585
Two years, it's all he's gonna serve.

12:33.686 --> 12:35.553
How's Mikey taking it?

12:35.654 --> 12:38.389
You know how he is.

12:38.491 --> 12:40.592
Rob a guy, beat him half
to death, you get a slap

12:40.619 --> 12:44.099
on the wrist. I got friends doing a hell of a
lot more time. For what, sticking a needle

12:44.123 --> 12:46.658
in their arms?
Be safe out there, OK?

12:48.868 --> 12:51.269
I've seen those shows
where... people get

12:51.337 --> 12:53.905
their hands caught in fishing
cables and stuff so...

12:53.973 --> 12:55.917
I will keep my hands away
from any such cables.

12:56.008 --> 12:59.110
I promise.

12:59.211 --> 13:01.846
<i>So you've been...</i>

13:01.947 --> 13:03.648
<i>throwing up off and on
for a month, but...</i>

13:03.716 --> 13:06.684
last night was the first time
you fainted?

13:06.786 --> 13:09.587
Yeah, pretty much. I have
to stop drinking tequila.

13:09.688 --> 13:11.632
It's weird though; I didn't
even feel drunk.

13:13.626 --> 13:17.662
OK, I hate to ask the obvious, but...
have you taken a pregnancy test?

13:20.733 --> 13:24.269
I can't stop thinking about her.

13:24.370 --> 13:27.272
You know. Who is she?

13:27.339 --> 13:29.574
Who is this woman...

13:29.675 --> 13:32.343
my husband's in love with?

13:32.411 --> 13:35.380
OK. What are you gonna do?

13:35.481 --> 13:38.950
Well, he said he was going out
of town tonight but, um...

13:39.051 --> 13:42.887
They're actually meeting at a hotel.

13:42.988 --> 13:45.757
I'm gonna go.
Oh... Sonia, don't.

13:45.858 --> 13:48.326
I just... I need to see

13:48.427 --> 13:52.063
what she looks like. That's it.

13:57.303 --> 14:01.072
This is...

14:01.140 --> 14:04.909
This is gonna be OK.

14:04.977 --> 14:06.937
I'm gonna see Jeff tonight
and I'm gonna tell him.

14:06.961 --> 14:09.581
Is this someone you've been
seeing for a while?

14:09.682 --> 14:12.016
Three and a half months.

14:12.117 --> 14:14.752
But he's got... a really

14:14.854 --> 14:17.789
steady job and he's
really solid. And...

14:17.890 --> 14:19.757
I know he wants kids. I mean,
he and his wife tried

14:19.825 --> 14:22.126
to have one a while ago,
but... she miscarried and

14:22.194 --> 14:25.263
he was really upset about it.
His wife? Ex-wife.

14:25.364 --> 14:28.533
I meant... ex-wife.
Chelsea.

14:28.601 --> 14:31.202
Be honest. Is...
this guy married?

14:31.270 --> 14:34.138
It's really just a matter

14:34.206 --> 14:36.166
of paperwork. I mean,
they both... want a divorce.

14:36.208 --> 14:38.243
How old is he?

14:38.310 --> 14:41.512
I love him.

14:43.749 --> 14:45.917
That's all that matters.
Everybody always gets

14:45.985 --> 14:48.786
so caught up about things like
age and money, but... none

14:48.854 --> 14:52.357
of that stuff matters. Love is
the most important thing.

14:57.429 --> 15:00.298
- What does that mean?
- <i>Liebe uberwindet</i>

15:00.399 --> 15:04.402
<i>alles.</i> "Love conquers all."
It was

15:04.503 --> 15:07.171
my mother's favorite saying.
Hey, Liz?

15:07.239 --> 15:10.441
I'll be right there.
You take your time.

15:10.509 --> 15:12.477
I'll take care of these people.
Thanks.

15:51.617 --> 15:53.561
My boyfriend made
a reservation for tonight.

15:53.585 --> 15:56.287
- What's the name?
- Chelsea Sheridans, but he said

15:56.355 --> 15:58.556
it might be under his name.

16:00.726 --> 16:04.362
- Jeff Clefton?
- â™ª Swimming â™ª - Yeah.

16:04.430 --> 16:08.066
â™ª Through the sadness â™ª
Here you go. Room

16:08.133 --> 16:10.335
two-fourteen.
Elevator's to the left.

16:10.436 --> 16:13.338
Thank you.
â™ª Hidden â™ª

16:13.439 --> 16:15.506
â™ª Secrets now revealed â™ª

16:18.877 --> 16:21.379
â™ª Now there's nothing â™ª

16:21.480 --> 16:23.915
â™ª To take back â™ª

16:23.983 --> 16:26.017
â™ª This train is heading â™ª

16:26.118 --> 16:28.853
â™ª Off the track â™ª

16:28.921 --> 16:32.123
â™ª All my colors
Turn to black â™ª

16:37.963 --> 16:41.032
â™ª All my colors
Turn to â™ª

16:41.133 --> 16:43.368
â™ª Black â™ª

17:35.621 --> 17:39.190
Hey! I didn't think

17:39.291 --> 17:40.992
you were coming in today.
It's Dr. Westerly's weekend.

17:41.093 --> 17:43.127
Oh, yeah, no. I... I'm not
officially here.

17:43.228 --> 17:46.130
I just came to take care of some
stuff, paperwork. Oh, hey, how was

17:46.231 --> 17:49.200
the anniversary party?
Uh... It was good, thanks.

18:01.013 --> 18:03.481
God, Jeff...

18:14.927 --> 18:18.029
- Hey.
- Hey.

18:30.342 --> 18:33.511
I'm happy to see you.
Me too.

18:33.579 --> 18:35.523
Been counting the minutes all day.

18:46.458 --> 18:48.426
<i>Yeah, she does look young.</i>
I don't give

18:48.494 --> 18:50.394
this girl more
than twenty-two max.

18:50.462 --> 18:52.797
Why would he wanna be with
someone who scoops ice cream

18:52.865 --> 18:55.733
all day? I mean,
how could he bring

18:55.801 --> 18:58.836
someone like that
to a work event, or...

18:58.904 --> 19:01.706
to meet his parents?
No, he can't. It's obvious,

19:01.773 --> 19:04.442
or people would think he was
insane. All right,

19:04.543 --> 19:06.711
Jeff has issues.
And they're HIS issues.

19:06.812 --> 19:10.581
This has nothing to do with you.

19:10.650 --> 19:12.594
Hm. You make my life

19:12.618 --> 19:14.652
so damn complicated.

19:14.720 --> 19:17.288
It doesn't have to be.

19:17.389 --> 19:19.333
We could make things official.

19:21.593 --> 19:25.329
I know that's what you want,
and that time is coming.

19:25.397 --> 19:27.899
I just have some stuff I still
gotta work through before

19:28.000 --> 19:31.269
I can divorce my wife.
How long do you think

19:31.336 --> 19:34.572
that's gonna take?
You keep asking me that

19:34.640 --> 19:36.584
and I just don't have
an answer for you.

19:40.512 --> 19:42.456
Longer than nine months?

19:47.853 --> 19:51.155
Uh... Are you telling me
you're pregnant?

19:51.256 --> 19:54.525
I... I know it isn't...

19:54.593 --> 19:58.362
expected, but... you... you said
you always wanted babies and...

19:58.430 --> 20:00.831
that you were devastated
when your wife miscarried.

20:06.805 --> 20:10.107
Um... You said that you were
on birth control pills.

20:10.209 --> 20:12.677
W... Were you? What...

20:12.744 --> 20:14.612
I mean, what happened there?
Of course I did.

20:14.680 --> 20:17.481
- You take 'em every day?
- Usually.

20:17.549 --> 20:20.017
I... I may have missed
a day or two...

20:20.085 --> 20:23.287
Chelsea! Look,
if I had known that,

20:23.388 --> 20:24.889
I would have worn protection myself.

20:24.990 --> 20:28.826
Right?

20:28.894 --> 20:32.396
I... I trusted you!

20:32.464 --> 20:34.065
Are you saying you can't trust me?

20:34.166 --> 20:37.401
(nervous laugh)
Look,

20:37.502 --> 20:39.570
I, uh...

20:39.638 --> 20:41.872
This is...
This is just... really

20:41.974 --> 20:44.242
unexpected.

20:44.309 --> 20:47.311
I don't get why you're mad.
(scoffing)

20:47.379 --> 20:49.981
I thought you'd be happy.
You keep saying that you wanna

20:50.008 --> 20:53.568
marry me and have a family with me. And, yeah,
I get it. This... this is super unexpected,

20:53.592 --> 20:55.219
but it's still what we both want.

20:55.287 --> 20:57.407
No. No, this is... This is
nothing like what I want.

20:57.431 --> 21:00.791
I'm still married, for crying out loud.

21:00.859 --> 21:03.494
You're getting a divorce.

21:03.562 --> 21:06.063
Your wife has a boyfriend in New York.

21:06.131 --> 21:08.966
She's not gonna care.
She doesn't...

21:09.067 --> 21:11.969
She... She won't understand.

21:17.676 --> 21:21.379
(sighing)
Hey.

21:25.183 --> 21:27.127
Hey. Uh...

21:30.355 --> 21:33.658
How far... How far
along are you?

21:33.725 --> 21:36.294
- I don't know.
- OK.

21:36.361 --> 21:38.229
Liz said I should probably
go see a doctor.

21:38.297 --> 21:40.998
Liz, your boss?
Jesus, Chelsea.

21:41.066 --> 21:44.035
How many people did you tell?
N...

21:44.136 --> 21:46.937
No one else. I...

21:47.005 --> 21:49.440
I should probably tell my dad.
Your dad,

21:49.541 --> 21:52.877
no. That's... I mean...
Why involve him?

21:52.978 --> 21:55.313
You know, this is...
This is about us.

21:55.380 --> 21:58.115
Well, the... doctor
probably won't

21:58.183 --> 22:00.127
let me sign any papers
until I'm eighteen.

22:04.256 --> 22:06.200
Did you say you're...
you're not eighteen?

22:11.263 --> 22:13.998
I'm seventeen.

22:17.269 --> 22:20.638
No, no, no. That's...
not possible.

22:20.739 --> 22:24.442
I met you in a bar.
You were drinking.

22:24.543 --> 22:26.410
Right? So I don't...
I've been doing that

22:26.511 --> 22:28.946
since I was fifteen.
Oh! Chelsea,

22:29.014 --> 22:31.949
geez, what...
Why didn't you tell me?

22:32.050 --> 22:34.985
- You never asked.
- Oh!

22:35.053 --> 22:36.997
It's not like I was hiding it from you!

22:37.022 --> 22:38.889
- Ha!
- The other day I told you that

22:38.957 --> 22:40.901
my mom's older than my dad and you said

22:40.926 --> 22:44.528
that age doesn't matter.
It matters if you're underage.

22:44.629 --> 22:48.165
Are... I...

22:48.233 --> 22:50.334
I need some time to think.
I just have to...

22:50.435 --> 22:54.138
go somewhere and think.

22:54.239 --> 22:57.007
- Are you leaving?
- I'm... gonna call you

22:57.109 --> 23:00.010
tomorrow. I just, uh...
Till then,

23:00.112 --> 23:03.314
can you just... not mention me
or the pregnancy

23:03.382 --> 23:05.449
to anyone? Can you promise that?

23:05.550 --> 23:08.719
OK?
Don't go. OK?

23:08.787 --> 23:10.731
I love you.

23:10.756 --> 23:14.125
I just... need
a little time alone.

23:14.192 --> 23:17.728
OK? Please?

23:17.829 --> 23:20.731
It's gonna be OK.
J... Jeff, please...

23:20.799 --> 23:24.301
Listen, listen, listen.
Hey, hey...

23:24.403 --> 23:27.438
We'll figure it all out. OK?

23:27.506 --> 23:30.741
All right? We're...
We're gonna figure it out.

23:30.809 --> 23:34.044
Just give me...

23:34.146 --> 23:36.480
Give me a day or two.

23:36.548 --> 23:40.384
Right? OK. OK.

23:40.485 --> 23:43.921
You know, this is...

23:44.022 --> 23:46.490
This is a lot. It's a lot

23:46.591 --> 23:49.093
to, uh... process. So just...

23:49.194 --> 23:52.797
you can stay here...
tonight. That's fine.

23:52.864 --> 23:56.033
And, uh, I'll...
I'll call you tomorrow.

23:56.134 --> 23:59.870
Um, I'll call you tomorrow.
It's gonna be OK.

23:59.938 --> 24:02.072
OK, good night.

24:32.571 --> 24:35.172
(texting signal)

24:40.345 --> 24:42.913
(beeping)

24:43.014 --> 24:45.316
[Hey, Chelsea. It's Adam.
Just calling to see]

24:45.417 --> 24:47.785
[if maybe you wanted to grab
dinner later or something.]

24:47.853 --> 24:50.373
[Um... I'm helping out Gramps at
the store but I should be done]

24:50.397 --> 24:53.157
[in an hour. And I can pick you
up at the gelato place]

24:53.225 --> 24:55.493
[if you're working. Anyways,
call me back. Let me know.]

25:41.640 --> 25:43.974
(sighing)

25:47.646 --> 25:50.514
Chelsea, a real man would
have been supportive.

25:50.582 --> 25:52.526
He should have just...
sat there and held you

25:52.584 --> 25:55.152
and talked you through it.
Thank you.

26:00.625 --> 26:02.569
What are you doing
with a married guy anyways?

26:05.664 --> 26:08.799
I don't know. He told me
his marriage wasn't

26:08.867 --> 26:11.435
going well and that...

26:11.503 --> 26:14.171
his wife was cheating on him.
And so I just...

26:16.308 --> 26:18.252
I thought he needed me.

26:35.961 --> 26:38.529
Are you... Are you
in love with him?

26:42.434 --> 26:45.736
Yeah. I think so.

26:45.804 --> 26:48.072
He's got everything

26:48.139 --> 26:51.442
that I want.
And what do you want?

26:54.579 --> 26:57.915
Someone with a good job, like...

26:57.983 --> 26:59.850
The kind you wear a suit to and...

26:59.951 --> 27:02.319
go to every day.

27:02.387 --> 27:04.888
Something that's not too dangerous.

27:07.225 --> 27:10.728
I don't know. I guess I just...
want someone who I can...

27:10.795 --> 27:14.598
sit in the grass with
and watch sunsets with.

27:14.699 --> 27:17.835
I'm so sick and tired
of going to smoky bars.

27:17.936 --> 27:21.538
You know?
Yeah, but...

27:21.607 --> 27:23.551
What about someone that would be
stoked if you told them

27:23.575 --> 27:25.643
you were having a baby.
Someone that wouldn't just

27:25.710 --> 27:27.811
leave you hanging
to go home to his wife?

27:29.848 --> 27:32.116
I'm sorry.

27:32.217 --> 27:35.686
I shouldn't have said that.

27:35.754 --> 27:37.698
Chelsea... I hope it works

27:37.722 --> 27:40.624
for you both. I really do.
But just know

27:40.692 --> 27:42.826
that you deserve to be with
someone who will give you

27:42.894 --> 27:44.838
everything you want.

27:48.033 --> 27:50.167
(sighing)

28:05.550 --> 28:07.951
Chelsea! You lying
little bitch.

28:08.053 --> 28:09.997
My brother spent the night
in jail 'cause of you.

28:10.055 --> 28:12.589
Lauren, the cops told me
not to talk to you.

28:12.691 --> 28:14.931
I guess you better listen
then. You need to go back and

28:14.993 --> 28:17.953
tell them he didn't do it. I'm not gonna
do that, because I saw him do it.

28:18.020 --> 28:20.380
There's no way you saw him
'cause he said he wasn't there.

28:20.404 --> 28:22.533
Either you made a mistake,

28:22.600 --> 28:25.269
or you're lying. And why
would you try to screw us?

28:25.336 --> 28:28.616
I've always been cool to you. That man is
in the hospital because of your brother.

28:28.640 --> 28:30.741
Look, I don't have
anything against you,

28:30.809 --> 28:33.744
but I'm not gonna lie to protect
him when I know he did it.

28:40.953 --> 28:42.897
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

28:42.921 --> 28:46.323
I'll catch you later.

28:58.069 --> 29:00.738
(engine starting)

29:47.585 --> 29:49.953
Thank you.

29:51.790 --> 29:53.734
Here's your change.

29:53.758 --> 29:56.193
Enjoy.
Thank you.

29:56.261 --> 29:58.595
Bye, sweetie.

30:04.068 --> 30:06.136
Hi. Welcome
to Stella Luna.

30:06.204 --> 30:08.939
I like your shirt. That's
a really great color on you.

30:10.875 --> 30:12.910
Oh. Thank you.

30:13.011 --> 30:15.712
- Can I offer you a sample?
- Actually, no.

30:18.750 --> 30:20.818
Uh, I...

30:20.885 --> 30:23.045
I already know what I want.
I'll just have a small, uh,

30:23.069 --> 30:24.755
cookies and cream.

30:24.856 --> 30:26.590
OK. Coming right up.

30:26.691 --> 30:28.458
But first you have to try this.

30:28.560 --> 30:31.428
My favorite flavor.

30:31.529 --> 30:35.299
â™ª

30:36.301 --> 30:38.245
What do you think?

30:38.269 --> 30:41.538
It's basil. I know it sounds
weird, but it is so good.

30:41.639 --> 30:44.441
Hm. I like your necklace.

30:44.509 --> 30:47.211
I'm guessing that

30:47.278 --> 30:49.379
you probably got that
from your boyfriend.

30:49.447 --> 30:51.148
Uh, no, actually.

30:51.249 --> 30:52.950
It was my mother's.
My dad gave it to me.

30:53.051 --> 30:56.186
It's my favorite thing I own.

30:56.287 --> 30:58.322
Mm. Yeah,

30:58.423 --> 31:00.367
mothers are pretty special.
Yeah.

31:00.391 --> 31:02.335
She didn't give it to me;

31:02.360 --> 31:04.628
My dad did after she died.

31:04.729 --> 31:08.165
But she wore it all the time, so
it helps me feel close to her.

31:08.233 --> 31:10.801
He said that I could have
her wedding ring

31:10.869 --> 31:12.989
on my birthday so I'm gonna add
that to the chain too.

31:17.075 --> 31:20.244
- When's your birthday?
- November.

31:20.345 --> 31:22.212
Let me guess. Um,

31:22.280 --> 31:25.082
twenty-two?

31:25.149 --> 31:26.683
That's funny. Everybody always
thinks I'm older than I am,

31:26.784 --> 31:30.020
but I'll be eighteen.

31:30.088 --> 31:32.256
That'll be
four-fifty, please.

31:34.493 --> 31:36.437
I'm sorry about your mom.

31:36.461 --> 31:38.929
Thanks.

31:40.265 --> 31:42.332
How recent?

31:42.400 --> 31:45.269
Um, she died when I was ten.

31:45.336 --> 31:48.205
That's not really enough time
to get to know somebody,

31:48.273 --> 31:51.408
but the memories I do have
are pretty great.

31:51.509 --> 31:53.543
â™ª

31:57.749 --> 31:59.816
Thank you.

31:59.884 --> 32:01.828
Have a great day.

32:05.857 --> 32:07.801
(indistinct conversation)

32:28.947 --> 32:32.182
See that right there?
That's the baby's feet.

32:34.052 --> 32:37.020
So cool.

32:37.089 --> 32:39.033
Is it a boy or a girl?

32:39.057 --> 32:42.426
Still too early to know that.
At around twenty weeks

32:42.493 --> 32:44.628
we'll be able to determine the gender.

32:44.729 --> 32:46.797
OK.

32:46.864 --> 32:48.532
Would you like to hear the heartbeat?

32:48.599 --> 32:50.567
Yes.

32:52.704 --> 32:55.639
(baby's heartbeat)

32:55.740 --> 32:58.075
Does the father know you're pregnant?

33:00.478 --> 33:03.513
Yeah. He, um,

33:03.581 --> 33:06.750
he doesn't wanna be involved.
Mm.

33:06.851 --> 33:09.686
Are you close to your parents?

33:09.787 --> 33:12.656
My mom isn't really around anymore,

33:12.757 --> 33:14.958
but my dad and I are pretty close.

33:15.026 --> 33:17.794
Good. Well, we have
resources, financial

33:17.862 --> 33:20.731
and educational,
for young women like yourself.

33:20.798 --> 33:22.742
I'll let you get dressed and we'll go

33:22.767 --> 33:25.469
over them together. All right?
Thank you.

33:32.877 --> 33:37.447
(dogs barking in distance)

33:37.548 --> 33:39.616
â™ª

33:42.053 --> 33:43.997
Hey, guys. The bartender
asked me

33:44.055 --> 33:46.923
to bring this over.
Thank you.

33:47.025 --> 33:48.969
- You're welcome.
- Thank you.

33:57.235 --> 33:59.179
(car honking)

33:59.203 --> 34:01.147
â™ª

34:03.141 --> 34:06.443
Hey. You OK?

34:06.544 --> 34:08.879
Yeah. I just needed
some quiet.

34:08.980 --> 34:11.848
(motorcycle roaring)

34:11.916 --> 34:14.885
I'm not sure you're gonna get
that out here.

34:14.985 --> 34:17.521
(laughing)
Mm.

34:17.621 --> 34:19.688
Uh,

34:19.791 --> 34:22.592
forgive me for saying,
but you don't really

34:22.659 --> 34:25.195
blend in with the crowd around here.

34:25.263 --> 34:27.496
It's funny.
I was just thinking

34:27.565 --> 34:29.509
the same thing about you
and your friend.

34:29.534 --> 34:31.501
Orin. Yeah,
we just got some gas

34:31.569 --> 34:33.513
down the road and saw this place,

34:33.538 --> 34:35.739
thought we'd check it out.
Orin's a cool name.

34:35.806 --> 34:38.074
I guess so.

34:38.176 --> 34:40.143
How 'bout you?

34:40.210 --> 34:43.280
You got a cool name?
Chelsea.

34:43.347 --> 34:45.815
- Nice.
- And you are?

34:45.917 --> 34:49.085
Jeff. Just plain ole Jeff.

34:49.187 --> 34:52.688
Except not that plain and not that old.

34:52.790 --> 34:54.958
That's very kind of you to say.

34:58.923 --> 35:01.763
Still trying to figure out what you're
doing out here all alone, though.

35:01.787 --> 35:05.135
- What's wrong with being alone?
- Nothin'.

35:05.236 --> 35:08.071
It just doesn't seem...

35:08.172 --> 35:11.174
Just figured there'd be

35:11.275 --> 35:12.509
guys all over you
if you were back down there.

35:12.610 --> 35:14.554
Yeah, well,

35:14.612 --> 35:16.446
they're not my type.

35:16.547 --> 35:19.382
â™ª

35:25.990 --> 35:29.893
Love conquers all?
Love conquers all.

35:29.994 --> 35:32.796
- Yeah.
- Yah.

35:32.864 --> 35:34.831
- Do you speak German?
<i>- Ein bisschen.</i>

35:34.899 --> 35:37.501
Took it for a couple of years
in high school.

35:37.602 --> 35:40.637
My mom was from Dusseldorf.

35:40.738 --> 35:42.439
I've never been, but I've seen pictures

35:42.507 --> 35:44.407
and it looks beautiful.

35:44.475 --> 35:46.543
(Orin): Hey, man.

35:46.611 --> 35:48.678
Did you find your wallet or what?

35:48.779 --> 35:51.281
Yes. Left in the car.

35:51.382 --> 35:54.551
Go rack 'em.
I'll be right down.

35:56.554 --> 35:58.522
Sure.

36:05.530 --> 36:07.474
It was nice talking with you, Chelsea.

36:11.602 --> 36:14.037
Well, you can always talk
to me again sometime.

36:18.075 --> 36:20.143
Tell you what.

36:20.244 --> 36:23.446
You let me give you my number.
(beeping)

36:23.548 --> 36:27.317
And that way, I can leave it up to you.

36:27.418 --> 36:30.353
Decision's in your hands.
OK.

36:30.454 --> 36:32.398
OK.

36:32.456 --> 36:34.400
<i>Gute nacht.</i>

36:34.458 --> 36:36.459
<i>Gute nacht.</i>

36:53.077 --> 36:55.021
Chelsea!

36:55.079 --> 36:58.481
Hey.

37:02.887 --> 37:05.755
You're seventeen, Chelsea.

37:05.823 --> 37:08.758
Why would you possibly think
it's a good idea

37:08.826 --> 37:11.194
to keep this baby?

37:11.262 --> 37:13.206
I have nothing...

37:15.466 --> 37:18.935
except my dad who's never around.

37:19.003 --> 37:21.671
I don't have a career or an education,

37:21.739 --> 37:24.574
but I have a baby growing inside me,

37:24.642 --> 37:27.510
a real baby with...

37:27.612 --> 37:29.980
with a heartbeat and little feet.

37:30.047 --> 37:32.983
Do you know what that makes me?

37:33.050 --> 37:35.719
That makes me a mom. That makes
me important to someone.

37:35.786 --> 37:39.155
You're a high school dropout.

37:39.223 --> 37:42.092
How can you possibly expect
to support a baby

37:42.159 --> 37:45.228
on a minimum wage job?
You don't have any real income.

37:47.132 --> 37:49.076
But you do.

37:49.100 --> 37:51.701
Ah, good God.

37:51.802 --> 37:54.804
And I can give
the baby love. That's more

37:54.872 --> 37:56.992
than what most people have.
It's more than what I had.

37:57.016 --> 37:59.442
I cannot financially support
a child if I am in jail.

37:59.510 --> 38:01.778
And that's exactly
where I'm gonna wind up

38:01.812 --> 38:04.581
if anyone finds out that I got
a seventeen-year-old pregnant!

38:04.682 --> 38:06.626
It won't be like that.

38:06.684 --> 38:09.085
Listen to me.

38:09.153 --> 38:12.756
I need you to understand
the situation that I am in.

38:12.823 --> 38:15.025
I spoke to a lawyer.

38:15.126 --> 38:18.261
They'll char... they'll charge
me as a sex offender!

38:18.329 --> 38:21.931
I'll lose my job.

38:21.999 --> 38:23.999
There's no way I'll ever
be allowed near that baby.

38:24.023 --> 38:26.002
- But we love each other.
- Could you...

38:26.103 --> 38:28.371
stop

38:28.439 --> 38:30.006
with the ethereal, whimsical,

38:30.107 --> 38:31.908
happy-go-lucky BS!

38:31.976 --> 38:34.511
This is real life, Chelsea!

38:34.612 --> 38:37.414
Love does not conquer all!

38:37.515 --> 38:40.617
(sighing)

38:45.457 --> 38:47.401
Hey, just... just...

38:47.425 --> 38:49.092
listen to me.

38:49.193 --> 38:52.028
Hey.

38:52.129 --> 38:54.464
I want what's right for both of us.

38:54.532 --> 38:56.399
You know that.

38:56.467 --> 38:59.903
There's $10,000 in here.

38:59.970 --> 39:03.707
Now you just let me take you
to get an abortion

39:03.774 --> 39:06.676
and it's all yours.
You can go to Germany

39:06.744 --> 39:10.013
or move out of here.
Anything you want.

39:13.751 --> 39:15.819
I am not trying to buy you off.

39:18.155 --> 39:20.623
It's only fair.
You give me what I want.

39:20.691 --> 39:23.927
It's only right that you get
something in return.

39:23.994 --> 39:26.396
I want this baby.

39:28.299 --> 39:30.243
I need this baby.

39:33.137 --> 39:35.377
I won't force you to be a part
of it. I won't tell anyone

39:35.401 --> 39:37.345
you're the father.

39:39.677 --> 39:41.621
Take the money.

39:41.645 --> 39:43.079
Take the money.

39:43.147 --> 39:46.049
(banging)
Take it!

39:55.526 --> 39:57.861
I don't want your money.

39:57.962 --> 40:00.402
I'm keeping this baby, and if
you don't wanna be a part of it,

40:00.498 --> 40:03.266
you can get out of our lives!
Ch-! Ah.

40:32.363 --> 40:34.864
I miss you so much, Mom.

40:36.734 --> 40:41.137
(sighing)
I miss you so much.

40:41.205 --> 40:43.173
(cell phone ringing)

40:48.579 --> 40:50.847
Hello?

40:50.915 --> 40:54.417
- I'm a prick. - What do you mean?
- Well, I gave you a hard time

40:54.485 --> 40:56.685
about being with that guy
and I had no right to do that.

40:56.709 --> 40:58.788
It actually meant a lot to me

40:58.856 --> 41:00.800
that you opened up
to me about everything.

41:00.825 --> 41:02.725
Well, it turns out
that he wants nothing

41:02.793 --> 41:05.094
to do with me or the baby.

41:05.196 --> 41:07.430
God, I'm such an idiot

41:07.531 --> 41:10.667
for even getting involved with him.

41:10.734 --> 41:12.735
Well, can I come over and cheer you up?

41:21.613 --> 41:23.557
(sighing)

41:23.581 --> 41:25.525
(footsteps approaching)

41:29.086 --> 41:31.030
Hey. There you are.

41:31.055 --> 41:32.889
Did you work late tonight?

41:32.990 --> 41:34.824
No, no,

41:34.925 --> 41:37.760
I met Angela for drinks.

41:37.828 --> 41:39.772
How was the conference?
Good.

41:39.830 --> 41:41.774
It was good.

41:43.868 --> 41:45.812
(sighing)

41:45.870 --> 41:48.071
Did you meet anyone interesting?

41:48.172 --> 41:50.940
Not really. Just the same old
crowd, you know.

41:53.010 --> 41:55.245
(deep sigh)

41:55.346 --> 41:57.380
Aren't you tired of lying?

41:59.917 --> 42:03.219
What's that supposed to mean?

42:03.320 --> 42:05.655
I know about Chelsea.

42:05.723 --> 42:08.324
Who's Chelsea?

42:08.425 --> 42:11.327
Stop. Just stop lying.

42:11.395 --> 42:14.030
I know you met her at a hotel.

42:14.131 --> 42:16.132
OK.

42:16.233 --> 42:18.768
Yeah, I, uh...

42:18.836 --> 42:20.780
slept with her,

42:20.804 --> 42:22.748
but just a couple of times

42:22.773 --> 42:24.908
and I certainly don't love her.

42:25.009 --> 42:26.876
That's just...

42:26.977 --> 42:29.579
supposed to make me feel better?
No.

42:32.516 --> 42:35.385
Listen. I...

42:35.486 --> 42:38.321
I knew it was wrong and I ended it.

42:38.389 --> 42:40.490
That's why I was at the hotel.

42:40.591 --> 42:42.535
To break up.

42:42.560 --> 42:44.427
I, I was miserable

42:44.495 --> 42:46.596
the whole time. I, I...
How old is she?

42:49.734 --> 42:51.678
She told me
she was twenty-one...

42:51.702 --> 42:54.938
but she may be younger.

42:59.176 --> 43:01.120
(sighing)
I'm sorry.

43:01.145 --> 43:04.814
But... it's not like
I set out to hurt you or...

43:04.882 --> 43:06.683
Jeff, I asked you so many times

43:06.750 --> 43:09.819
if you were having an affair.
I knew in my gut

43:09.887 --> 43:12.455
that you were. And how could you
deny it over and over?

43:14.558 --> 43:17.427
God.

43:17.494 --> 43:19.596
What happened to you?

43:22.733 --> 43:26.135
I mean, were you always
like this and...

43:26.203 --> 43:27.604
I just didn't see it?
What happened to me?

43:27.705 --> 43:29.539
It's what happened to "us"...

43:29.607 --> 43:31.107
Don't try to put it on us!

43:31.175 --> 43:33.119
We used to be happy.

43:36.113 --> 43:38.081
We used to relate
to each other, laugh, have fun.

43:40.818 --> 43:42.762
But ever since we lost the baby...

43:42.786 --> 43:46.222
No, no, no. Don't go there.

43:46.290 --> 43:48.530
That's exactly what I mean.
You'll never talk about it.

43:48.554 --> 43:51.561
You'll never admit
that since the miscarriage,

43:51.629 --> 43:54.464
we're miserable.

43:54.565 --> 43:56.633
You're miserable.

43:56.700 --> 43:58.768
The only thing I ever see
in your eyes any more

43:58.869 --> 44:02.572
is disappointment.
Yeah.

44:02.673 --> 44:05.375
Losing the baby was disappointing...

44:07.544 --> 44:09.488
But you dealt with it by...

44:09.513 --> 44:12.382
running around with a teenager?

44:12.449 --> 44:14.717
Yeah, it's, it's...
I'm sure it's easier

44:14.785 --> 44:17.053
to hook up in hotel rooms

44:17.121 --> 44:19.889
and plan secret meetings
instead of being a man

44:19.990 --> 44:22.525
and dealing with your problems!

44:24.895 --> 44:27.330
I never said I was perfect.

44:27.398 --> 44:30.266
And yes, I slipped up;
I did something

44:30.334 --> 44:32.774
I shouldn't have done. But I'm
not the first guy on the planet

44:32.798 --> 44:35.800
to do it,
and you're not perfect either.

44:37.775 --> 44:39.842
I didn't cheat on you.

44:39.910 --> 44:42.945
No, no, you did something
just as bad though:

44:43.013 --> 44:45.915
You gave up on us.

44:45.983 --> 44:48.051
I don't give a crap

44:48.152 --> 44:51.354
about that girl. I want you,

44:51.422 --> 44:53.289
the one I fell in love with,

44:53.390 --> 44:56.259
who I still love, but...

44:56.360 --> 44:59.395
I don't know where she is anymore.

44:59.463 --> 45:01.731
She's been gone since we lost the baby.

45:10.174 --> 45:12.975
Let's go to counselling.

45:13.077 --> 45:16.145
Let's put us back
together. We'll get

45:16.246 --> 45:18.815
through all this and come out
the other side stronger.

45:24.154 --> 45:27.056
No.

45:27.124 --> 45:30.059
I don't...
I don't want that.

45:33.464 --> 45:36.666
I'm asking Angela to draw up
divorce papers.

45:36.767 --> 45:40.536
- What?
- Yeah.

45:40.604 --> 45:43.706
I think it's best if you find

45:43.774 --> 45:45.742
somewhere else to stay.
No.

45:45.843 --> 45:48.211
Please don't say that.

45:50.380 --> 45:52.324
Please.

46:00.224 --> 46:02.168
You gonna try?

46:04.061 --> 46:06.129
Yeah, I'm pretty sure

46:06.230 --> 46:08.174
my doctor specifically told me
never to eat this.

46:08.198 --> 46:10.366
<i>Yeah, right, she did not.
All right.</i>

46:10.434 --> 46:12.378
<i>Don't be a chicken; Be brave.</i>

46:12.402 --> 46:14.804
(laughing)
Nope.

46:17.141 --> 46:19.675
<i>- That was amazing.
- I did it though,</i>

46:19.777 --> 46:22.645
<i>so don't ever call me a chicken again.</i>

46:22.713 --> 46:25.815
You're one
of the bravest people I know.

46:25.883 --> 46:27.650
No, I mean that.

46:27.751 --> 46:29.752
Look, what you did for my grandpa,

46:29.820 --> 46:33.256
when you testified back then,
I know you were scared

46:33.323 --> 46:35.291
and you went through
and you did it anyway.

46:35.359 --> 46:37.303
And I'll never forget that.

46:37.327 --> 46:40.396
Thanks.

46:42.566 --> 46:44.566
And you're gonna get
through this too. I know it.

46:44.590 --> 46:47.436
You don't need some successful
businessman like Jeff

46:47.504 --> 46:51.040
to help you either.
You're a tough little thing.

47:07.191 --> 47:09.135
- Sonia...
- Don't.

47:09.193 --> 47:11.137
OK, just...

47:11.195 --> 47:21.003
Just don't.

47:41.959 --> 47:46.796
(honking)
(tires screeching)

47:50.067 --> 47:52.935
- <i>What did you find out?</i>
- A bunch of stuff.

47:53.003 --> 47:55.123
Here's the kicker: She was just
at a pregnancy clinic.

47:55.147 --> 47:56.772
I think she's knocked up.

47:56.840 --> 47:58.784
Really?

47:58.842 --> 48:00.643
I'm not a hundred percent sure, but...

48:00.711 --> 48:03.479
I think he doesn't want
the baby and she does.

48:03.547 --> 48:05.514
They were arguing about it
in front of her house.

48:05.616 --> 48:08.818
And he's rich too.

48:08.919 --> 48:10.987
Throwing money around, literally.

48:13.223 --> 48:16.058
I'm thinking possibilities right now.

48:16.159 --> 48:17.960
I just want revenge for them

48:18.028 --> 48:19.862
putting you away
for something you didn't do.

48:19.930 --> 48:21.998
Look how much you've suffered.

48:27.804 --> 48:30.673
And gelato bitch can't make it right...

48:32.743 --> 48:34.687
But sugar daddy can.

48:55.933 --> 48:57.877
(whimsical music)

49:01.138 --> 49:03.139
(ringtone)

49:11.448 --> 49:14.483
- Hello?
- [Is this Sonia?]

49:14.551 --> 49:16.495
- Yes, it is.
- [You were listed]

49:16.553 --> 49:18.497
[as an emergency contact
for Jeff Clefton.]

49:18.522 --> 49:21.157
[He's being transported
to the hospital.]

49:21.258 --> 49:23.326
What?

49:23.393 --> 49:26.228
- Woman: [How is he?]
- They're keeping him

49:26.296 --> 49:29.098
sedated. Yeah, I don't know
for how long.

49:29.199 --> 49:31.143
[If he has brain swelling...]
(cellphone alert)

49:31.168 --> 49:32.902
[...you know, they probably want
to make sure he doesn't have]

49:32.970 --> 49:34.914
[a seizure or something... ]
Hang on.

49:49.152 --> 49:51.454
She's pregnant.

49:55.926 --> 49:57.870
(sighing)

50:24.221 --> 50:26.188
â™ª

50:54.651 --> 50:56.685
Hey.

50:56.753 --> 50:59.355
I remember you. You work
down the street, right?

50:59.456 --> 51:01.557
Basil gelato?

51:05.395 --> 51:07.496
Aw...

51:07.564 --> 51:09.508
All these baby clothes are so cute.

51:09.533 --> 51:11.400
I wish I could afford to buy them all.

51:11.468 --> 51:13.903
Do you have a baby?

51:15.872 --> 51:19.175
No, no. I just love kids.

51:21.611 --> 51:23.555
How 'bout you?

51:25.248 --> 51:27.192
I'm actually expecting.

51:29.053 --> 51:30.997
Oh. Congratulations.

51:31.021 --> 51:34.657
- Thank you.
- Do you have a name picked out?

51:34.758 --> 51:36.625
Uh, no.

51:36.693 --> 51:39.195
Not yet, but I am open to suggestions.

51:39.296 --> 51:41.163
Oh.

51:41.231 --> 51:44.200
You know, for, for a boy, Alexander.

51:46.336 --> 51:49.038
And for a girl, Annette.

51:49.106 --> 51:52.041
Both A's. They'll both
be first when the teacher

51:52.109 --> 51:54.053
asks them to line up.

51:56.446 --> 51:58.948
I never thought of that.

51:59.015 --> 52:02.718
Alexander was my grandfather's
name, and Annette

52:02.786 --> 52:04.653
was my grandmother's.
People don't do that

52:04.721 --> 52:08.057
as much anymore,
name kids after family members.

52:08.158 --> 52:10.159
No.

52:10.227 --> 52:12.194
No, they don't.

52:14.331 --> 52:16.532
What about your boyfriend
or... or husband?

52:18.469 --> 52:20.413
We are not really

52:20.437 --> 52:22.671
together anymore,

52:22.772 --> 52:24.716
so it's just up to me.

52:28.845 --> 52:31.680
I'm... I'm sorry
to hear that.

52:31.749 --> 52:33.693
It happens.

52:33.717 --> 52:36.585
I still think I'm gonna be a good mom.

52:36.653 --> 52:38.597
I actually start
a parenting class next week.

52:38.622 --> 52:40.566
Oh, that's great.

52:42.626 --> 52:44.570
Bye.

52:44.594 --> 52:48.330
Oh. Bye.
(sighing)

52:55.705 --> 52:57.649
This place is really expensive.

52:57.707 --> 52:59.651
Chelsea, no budget tonight, OK?

52:59.676 --> 53:02.545
Gramps picked the place
and he gave me his credit card.

53:02.646 --> 53:04.513
- Really?
- Yeah.

53:04.614 --> 53:07.094
He was thrilled when I told him
I was taking you out on a date.

53:08.318 --> 53:10.386
So this is a date?

53:10.453 --> 53:13.322
I mean, isn't it?
I mean, no pressure

53:13.390 --> 53:16.225
if you don't want it to be.
But this is my best tie,

53:16.293 --> 53:18.237
so if we could make it...

53:20.096 --> 53:22.040
Why would you wanna date
a pregnant girl?

53:22.065 --> 53:24.867
I don't see you
as a pregnant girl; I just...

53:24.935 --> 53:28.337
I see you as Chelsea, a girl
I've liked for a long time.

53:28.405 --> 53:31.707
Yeah, but eventually
I'm gonna have a kid

53:31.775 --> 53:33.719
and that kid isn't yours.

53:33.743 --> 53:36.645
I'm not sure I get
where you're going with that.

53:38.949 --> 53:41.417
Why would you wanna bother
with someone else's child?

53:41.451 --> 53:44.920
You don't think you can love
a baby that you didn't create?

53:44.988 --> 53:46.989
- No, of course I do.
- I would know firsthand,

53:47.057 --> 53:48.757
'cause I was adopted.

53:48.858 --> 53:50.926
- You were?
- Yeah.

53:50.994 --> 53:52.761
I was, by two fantastic parents

53:52.829 --> 53:55.331
that love me as much as anyone could.

53:55.432 --> 53:57.766
Look, Chelsea, it doesn't matter

53:57.834 --> 53:59.778
who contributes a sperm
or contributes an egg.

53:59.803 --> 54:01.670
What matters is in your heart.

54:01.738 --> 54:03.682
After that, it's just biology.

54:05.842 --> 54:09.545
And I think you should have
some of this. It's my favorite.

54:09.646 --> 54:11.614
OK.

54:13.550 --> 54:15.494
(Sonia): I don't know.
But I just feel

54:15.518 --> 54:18.954
like somebody needs
to stand up for Chelsea.

54:20.890 --> 54:22.958
She's about to become a mother.

54:23.059 --> 54:26.161
Yes. That, my love,
is not your problem.

54:26.263 --> 54:29.064
(sighing)
I know,

54:29.165 --> 54:31.800
but maybe I can help make a
difference in this child's life

54:31.868 --> 54:33.812
if I can convince him
to take responsibility.

54:33.837 --> 54:36.572
What is going on
with you and this girl?

54:36.640 --> 54:39.708
It's just... the more
I find out about her,

54:39.809 --> 54:42.645
the more I wanna know.

54:42.746 --> 54:44.513
How many times have you seen her?

54:44.581 --> 54:47.383
Just a few.

54:47.450 --> 54:50.419
Last time we talked about baby names.

54:50.520 --> 54:52.488
OK, Sonia!

54:52.589 --> 54:55.491
Mm. I'm sorry.

54:55.592 --> 54:57.860
I can't explain it.

54:57.961 --> 54:59.962
I just feel some sort of
connection to her.

55:00.030 --> 55:02.264
And I don't know,

55:02.332 --> 55:05.167
maybe it's because we both lost
our moms at a young age

55:05.235 --> 55:07.770
or because we were both
duped by the same guy.

55:07.871 --> 55:10.806
But Ang, she is not this evil

55:10.907 --> 55:14.176
little homewrecker.

55:14.277 --> 55:18.080
She's... she's really
sweet and... nalve.

55:20.283 --> 55:23.085
Thanks for dinner.
It was really nice going

55:23.186 --> 55:25.130
on a real date.
Yeah.

55:25.188 --> 55:27.132
Maybe we can do it again
when I get back.

55:27.190 --> 55:29.725
You going somewhere?

55:29.826 --> 55:31.770
Yeah, just for a few days.
I gotta go

55:31.828 --> 55:33.772
to Ohio. My cousin's
getting married.

55:33.830 --> 55:35.964
Kinda have to go.
I'm in the wedding so...

55:36.066 --> 55:38.010
Sounds fun.

55:38.068 --> 55:41.670
Yeah. So is that a yes?

55:41.771 --> 55:43.731
I can take you out again?
That... that is a yes.

55:43.755 --> 55:45.756
Cool.

55:51.715 --> 55:54.016
Well, good night, Chelsea.

55:54.117 --> 55:56.118
Good night.

56:22.278 --> 56:24.222
(Jeff): Thanks for coming.

56:24.247 --> 56:27.015
I can only imagine what you're feeling,

56:27.083 --> 56:29.084
me having a baby with her
and not with you.

56:29.152 --> 56:31.220
You have no idea what I'm feeling.

56:31.287 --> 56:34.356
I wasn't trying
to get her pregnant, Sonia.

56:34.424 --> 56:36.625
I offered her money
to get rid of it, but...

56:36.726 --> 56:38.961
You tried to pay her off?

56:39.028 --> 56:40.996
You know as well as I do that
it makes no sense

56:41.064 --> 56:42.865
for her to keep it.

56:42.932 --> 56:46.001
She's too young and I have
no desire to be involved.

56:46.102 --> 56:48.203
Do you hear yourself?

56:48.271 --> 56:50.239
Do you understand
the ramifications here?

56:50.306 --> 56:53.375
If she keeps the baby,
eventually everyone

56:53.443 --> 56:55.387
will realize that I knocked up

56:55.412 --> 56:58.881
a seventeen-year-old.
I don't deserve to be on some

56:58.948 --> 57:02.050
sex offender list
like a creepy pedophile.

57:02.118 --> 57:04.653
She's about to become a teenage mother.

57:04.754 --> 57:07.055
You owe it to her to help her.

57:09.159 --> 57:11.103
I owe it to myself to do

57:11.127 --> 57:13.071
what my lawyer tells me to do.

57:21.671 --> 57:23.615
I don't know who you are anymore.

57:35.084 --> 57:37.028
Here ya go.

57:40.223 --> 57:42.191
- Hi.
- Hey.

57:42.292 --> 57:44.236
I'll have a basil gelato, please.

57:46.563 --> 57:48.507
Got you hooked on that one, didn't I?

57:48.531 --> 57:51.467
Yeah, I crave it.

57:51.534 --> 57:54.503
Um, I brought you a little something.

58:00.243 --> 58:02.411
Thank you.

58:02.479 --> 58:04.546
Yeah. I just thought
you could use them.

58:09.152 --> 58:11.153
One basil gelato coming right up.

58:11.221 --> 58:13.121
Thanks.

58:13.189 --> 58:15.257
And I never even finished
high school so...

58:17.460 --> 58:20.829
You dropped out? Why?

58:20.864 --> 58:22.808
My grades were fine
and all. I just...

58:22.832 --> 58:25.272
My dad wasn't really around much
so it was hard to get a ride.

58:25.296 --> 58:27.536
And then when he actually was home,

58:27.604 --> 58:29.548
he often stayed out late.
So it was...

58:31.140 --> 58:34.009
Wait a minute! No way.

58:34.110 --> 58:36.345
Oh, my God! I know him.

58:36.446 --> 58:39.581
- Who? What? - I gotta go.
- Are you OK?

58:39.649 --> 58:41.216
Yeah. I'm just gonna try to
catch a bus before it gets dark.

58:41.251 --> 58:44.586
- Hang on. Let me drive you.
- You sure? It's pretty far.

58:44.654 --> 58:47.656
- It's fine.
- OK. Um, we have to go now.

58:51.194 --> 58:53.495
So, who was that guy?

58:53.563 --> 58:56.899
Mikey warned me
he was getting out but...

58:56.966 --> 58:59.268
I didn't think
he'd come looking for me.

58:59.335 --> 59:01.279
Honey, I think that
instead of taking you home,

59:01.371 --> 59:03.238
I should take you to the police.

59:03.339 --> 59:05.173
You need to tell them what happened.

59:05.275 --> 59:07.442
But...

59:07.510 --> 59:09.454
what are they gonna do?

59:09.479 --> 59:11.914
It's not just me anymore.

59:11.981 --> 59:13.925
I have to think
about my baby's safety too.

59:21.190 --> 59:23.759
He's right here.

59:23.826 --> 59:26.361
Greg Foster.

59:29.332 --> 59:32.768
As a condition of his parole, he can't
make contact. He didn't, did he?

59:32.869 --> 59:35.170
We didn't give him a chance.

59:35.271 --> 59:37.439
OK.

59:37.507 --> 59:39.374
I'll let his parole officer know.

59:39.442 --> 59:41.877
In the meantime, Chelsea,
do you have someplace else

59:41.945 --> 59:43.779
you can stay?
Relatives or a friend's?

59:43.880 --> 59:46.014
Um...

59:46.082 --> 59:48.984
She can stay with me.

59:50.620 --> 59:52.688
Uh...

59:52.755 --> 59:54.556
I live in Huntington Heights
and we have a security system.

59:54.624 --> 59:56.858
We?

59:56.926 --> 59:58.660
Oh! My, my...
my husband and I.

59:58.728 --> 01:00:01.663
But we're separated,

01:00:01.731 --> 01:00:03.899
so it's just me.

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.168
Good.

01:00:06.235 --> 01:00:08.804
Now if you see Foster lurking again,

01:00:08.871 --> 01:00:11.173
call me.
If he does anything

01:00:11.240 --> 01:00:13.709
that allows me to arrest him
on a violation, I will.

01:00:13.810 --> 01:00:15.754
Here's my card.

01:00:18.648 --> 01:00:20.592
- Thank you.
- Absolutely.

01:00:28.591 --> 01:00:31.293
Hi.

01:00:31.361 --> 01:00:33.328
Ready?

01:00:33.396 --> 01:00:36.098
Are you sure you want to do this?

01:00:36.165 --> 01:00:38.667
I mean, you're being really nice,

01:00:38.768 --> 01:00:40.712
but you don't even know me.

01:00:47.477 --> 01:00:50.679
Chelsea, uh,
I need to tell you something.

01:00:52.815 --> 01:00:54.883
When I came into the gelato shop,

01:00:54.951 --> 01:00:57.919
it wasn't an accident.
I wanted to meet you.

01:00:58.021 --> 01:01:01.423
Why?

01:01:04.927 --> 01:01:07.329
Because Jeff, um...

01:01:07.397 --> 01:01:09.264
your Jeff, is...

01:01:09.365 --> 01:01:13.035
he's my husband,
soon to be ex-husband.

01:01:13.136 --> 01:01:16.304
What?

01:01:16.372 --> 01:01:19.975
Did he put you up to this?
No! No, not at all.

01:01:20.009 --> 01:01:22.689
He doesn't even know we talked. Why
is everyone always lying to me?

01:01:22.713 --> 01:01:24.880
Chelsea, please, let me explain.

01:01:24.981 --> 01:01:27.249
I want you out.

01:01:27.350 --> 01:01:29.294
I told you everything about me.
Stop.

01:01:29.318 --> 01:01:32.087
You need to hear what I have to say.

01:01:32.188 --> 01:01:35.057
Jeff doesn't know I'm here.

01:01:37.226 --> 01:01:39.394
I suspected he was having an affair,

01:01:39.495 --> 01:01:41.563
so...

01:01:41.631 --> 01:01:43.498
I went to the hotel
where you and he met.

01:01:43.566 --> 01:01:47.335
I just needed to see
what you looked like.

01:01:50.506 --> 01:01:52.674
Anyway, I was shocked
at how young you are and...

01:01:52.742 --> 01:01:56.445
I just wanted to know more
about you. That's it.

01:01:56.512 --> 01:01:59.047
Well, now you know
everything there is to know.

01:01:59.148 --> 01:02:01.516
No, that doesn't...
That's not it.

01:02:01.617 --> 01:02:04.486
When I first met you that day,

01:02:04.587 --> 01:02:06.555
you were just so sweet.

01:02:06.622 --> 01:02:09.157
You know, I genuinely liked you.

01:02:09.225 --> 01:02:11.169
I wanted to hate you,
but it was the opposite.

01:02:12.995 --> 01:02:15.097
And then I realized

01:02:15.164 --> 01:02:18.867
that we'd both been played
by the same person.

01:02:18.968 --> 01:02:22.170
How can you say that you were played
when you did the exact same thing?

01:02:22.271 --> 01:02:25.307
- What?
- Your boyfriend in New York,

01:02:25.408 --> 01:02:27.175
the one you hid from him for months.

01:02:27.276 --> 01:02:30.779
Is that what he said?

01:02:30.880 --> 01:02:32.824
What a jerk.

01:02:32.882 --> 01:02:34.950
I...

01:02:35.051 --> 01:02:37.251
I didn't have a boyfriend
in New York, or anywhere else.

01:02:37.275 --> 01:02:40.678
I was completely faithful
our entire marriage.

01:02:44.093 --> 01:02:46.037
Chelsea,

01:02:46.095 --> 01:02:48.830
he lied to us both.

01:02:48.931 --> 01:02:51.867
And he's trying to get out
of supporting your baby

01:02:51.968 --> 01:02:53.912
and that's wrong.

01:02:53.970 --> 01:02:55.914
OK? You can't
let him do that.

01:02:55.972 --> 01:02:57.939
He wants nothing to do with it.

01:02:58.040 --> 01:02:59.984
Hey.

01:03:00.042 --> 01:03:03.078
Everything's gonna be OK.

01:03:03.179 --> 01:03:05.781
OK? I promise.

01:03:11.888 --> 01:03:13.832
So where's Jeff staying?

01:03:13.856 --> 01:03:17.159
Is he with a friend or something?

01:03:17.226 --> 01:03:20.028
Uh, he is in the hospital,
probably for another week.

01:03:20.096 --> 01:03:23.465
Why?
(texting signal)

01:03:23.499 --> 01:03:26.701
- <i>Text from Cassandra. Would you like me to read it?</i>
- Yes.

01:03:26.803 --> 01:03:28.603
<i>"-" Emergency here.
Dog hit by a car.</i>

01:03:28.671 --> 01:03:30.839
<i>Westerly is requesting
your assistance."</i>

01:03:30.907 --> 01:03:33.508
- I'll be right there.
- <i>Sending "I'll be right there."</i>

01:03:33.609 --> 01:03:35.310
We are gonna have
to swing by the clinic.

01:03:35.378 --> 01:03:37.212
OK?
Yeah.

01:03:37.313 --> 01:03:40.582
Yeah, of course.

01:03:40.650 --> 01:03:43.985
OK, sweetie. Hang on.

01:03:44.053 --> 01:03:45.997
Just need to get you stabilized

01:03:46.022 --> 01:03:48.957
so we can check for internal bleeding.

01:03:49.025 --> 01:03:51.860
Good girl. OK.

01:04:03.005 --> 01:04:06.842
Have you ever had a pet?
Nah.

01:04:06.909 --> 01:04:09.544
My dad never really wanted any.
(purring)

01:04:09.612 --> 01:04:11.913
Well, maybe...

01:04:11.981 --> 01:04:13.815
we could take her home with us tonight.

01:04:13.916 --> 01:04:15.750
Can we?

01:04:15.852 --> 01:04:18.320
I'll get a crate.

01:04:18.421 --> 01:04:22.123
OK. Did you hear that?

01:04:25.595 --> 01:04:28.964
Is everything OK?

01:04:33.169 --> 01:04:35.113
I'm really sorry
for breaking up your marriage.

01:04:35.171 --> 01:04:37.973
Chelsea, you didn't
break up our marriage.

01:04:38.040 --> 01:04:40.575
Jeff did that.

01:04:40.676 --> 01:04:43.778
I still feel bad.

01:04:43.880 --> 01:04:46.014
You're a good person.

01:04:46.115 --> 01:04:49.217
You deserve a good guy.

01:04:49.318 --> 01:04:52.320
So do you.

01:05:01.831 --> 01:05:04.065
Do you need your bag?

01:05:04.133 --> 01:05:06.568
Oh, my vet bag? No, we can
just leave it in the car.

01:05:17.313 --> 01:05:20.916
Can I ask you something?

01:05:21.017 --> 01:05:23.585
Of course.

01:05:23.653 --> 01:05:26.888
Jeff told me that...

01:05:26.956 --> 01:05:29.024
you lost a baby.

01:05:29.091 --> 01:05:31.960
Is that true?
Yes.

01:05:32.028 --> 01:05:34.362
That part is true.

01:05:36.532 --> 01:05:39.100
I got pregnant a year
and a half ago. I miscarried.

01:05:41.203 --> 01:05:44.039
- I'm sorry.
- Thank you.

01:05:44.106 --> 01:05:47.175
At least that part wasn't a lie.

01:05:49.279 --> 01:05:51.223
You know...

01:05:51.247 --> 01:05:54.049
the one thing I know
I've always wanted was kids.

01:05:54.116 --> 01:05:57.786
You would have been a good mom.

01:05:57.853 --> 01:06:00.488
You actually remind me
a little bit of mine.

01:06:00.557 --> 01:06:02.501
I do?

01:06:02.525 --> 01:06:04.469
Yeah.

01:06:14.770 --> 01:06:17.939
- [I've got your freedom paperwork finished!]
- Chelsea's here.

01:06:18.007 --> 01:06:19.951
- [What?]
- It's a long story.

01:06:20.009 --> 01:06:22.369
Don't ask any questions. But,
um, I'll look at the paperwork

01:06:22.393 --> 01:06:24.846
when I get some time alone, OK?
[OK...]

01:06:24.914 --> 01:06:26.982
(doorbell)
Listen, I've gotta run.

01:06:27.049 --> 01:06:28.717
Someone's at the door.
[Call me tonight.]

01:06:28.818 --> 01:06:30.762
OK, I will. Bye.

01:06:39.895 --> 01:06:42.297
Special delivery.

01:06:45.368 --> 01:06:47.369
Hello, Chelsea.

01:06:51.173 --> 01:06:54.242
Now that we're all here...

01:06:54.343 --> 01:06:56.287
let's get down to business.

01:06:58.114 --> 01:07:01.483
Here's what's going to happen next.

01:07:03.419 --> 01:07:06.654
You, Sonia Clefton,

01:07:06.722 --> 01:07:10.025
are gonna write a check
to Chelsea for 50 grand.

01:07:10.092 --> 01:07:13.595
And Chelsea and I are going
to go to the bank

01:07:13.696 --> 01:07:15.897
and cash that check.

01:07:15.965 --> 01:07:18.099
My companion is gonna stay here

01:07:18.167 --> 01:07:20.111
and keep you company.

01:07:23.305 --> 01:07:25.573
(muffled speaking)
What? What, what, what?

01:07:25.674 --> 01:07:27.442
Ah!

01:07:27.543 --> 01:07:29.611
Speak.

01:07:29.712 --> 01:07:34.449
The bank won't cash a check that large.

01:07:34.550 --> 01:07:36.551
She's gonna have to deposit it

01:07:36.619 --> 01:07:38.920
and wait for the funds to transfer.

01:07:43.292 --> 01:07:46.027
Well, I need that money.

01:07:48.064 --> 01:07:50.008
So you need to figure it out.

01:07:50.032 --> 01:07:53.268
OK. OK. We...

01:07:53.369 --> 01:07:56.204
We have cash in a...

01:07:56.305 --> 01:07:58.640
- Spit it out.
- We have cash

01:07:58.741 --> 01:08:00.809
in a safety deposit box.
How much?

01:08:00.910 --> 01:08:04.045
25,000. And...

01:08:04.113 --> 01:08:06.281
with the jewelry inside,
and the money it's...

01:08:06.348 --> 01:08:08.416
it's way over fifty.

01:08:13.756 --> 01:08:17.292
I want to explain

01:08:17.359 --> 01:08:20.595
my little insurance policy so
that we're all very, very clear.

01:08:20.662 --> 01:08:23.430
While I'm at the bank with you,

01:08:23.499 --> 01:08:26.033
she's gonna take Chelsea
to an undisclosed location.

01:08:26.102 --> 01:08:28.803
If my companion doesn't
get a text from me

01:08:28.904 --> 01:08:30.371
by 5PM saying that I have the money,

01:08:30.439 --> 01:08:33.207
Chelsea dies.

01:08:33.274 --> 01:08:35.276
And so does her baby.

01:08:35.377 --> 01:08:38.979
As long as you do what I say,

01:08:39.048 --> 01:08:41.448
everyone's going to be just fine.

01:08:41.517 --> 01:08:43.651
Lauren and I will be long gone

01:08:43.719 --> 01:08:46.821
and you'll never have
to deal with us again.

01:08:46.921 --> 01:08:49.457
- Please, just let me...
- Shut your mouth!

01:08:49.558 --> 01:08:51.502
Make this easy.

01:08:51.560 --> 01:08:54.696
All right? Let's go.

01:09:14.649 --> 01:09:17.919
Chelsea really won the lottery
when she found you, huh?

01:09:17.987 --> 01:09:20.188
Whatever you think
Chelsea owes you, I'll pay it.

01:09:20.256 --> 01:09:22.557
Whatever it takes
to get everything back to even.

01:09:26.194 --> 01:09:29.096
Yeah, that's something
a rich person would say.

01:09:29.198 --> 01:09:31.332
No amount of money

01:09:31.399 --> 01:09:33.344
can make things right.

01:09:33.435 --> 01:09:36.037
It's 3 years of my life, gone...

01:09:36.138 --> 01:09:38.206
forever.

01:09:38.307 --> 01:09:40.251
You're right, but...

01:09:40.276 --> 01:09:43.044
the next 3 can be very different.

01:09:45.046 --> 01:09:47.749
Chelsea's just a child
and so is your sister.

01:09:47.816 --> 01:09:50.136
Don't drag them into something
that you and I can work out.

01:09:55.491 --> 01:09:59.661
I like how you think.

01:09:59.728 --> 01:10:02.128
Let's start with the bank and
we'll see where this goes, huh?

01:10:07.403 --> 01:10:09.437
Lauren, he's not gonna let us go.

01:10:09.505 --> 01:10:11.906
- He said he would!
- You're out of your mind.

01:10:12.007 --> 01:10:14.409
I already called the cops on him once.

01:10:17.046 --> 01:10:18.990
Lauren, he's gonna kill us
unless you stop him.

01:10:19.014 --> 01:10:22.850
And you're gonna spend
the rest of your life in jail.

01:10:22.952 --> 01:10:24.986
- Shut up!
- Lauren, I...

01:10:25.087 --> 01:10:27.789
I said shut up!

01:10:34.797 --> 01:10:37.732
Get in line.

01:10:51.447 --> 01:10:54.182
Where are we going?

01:10:54.283 --> 01:10:57.752
You'll find out very soon.

01:10:59.822 --> 01:11:03.057
May I help you?

01:11:03.125 --> 01:11:05.493
Hi. Um, the name is
Sonia Clefton,

01:11:05.594 --> 01:11:08.029
and I'd like to access
my safety deposit box, please.

01:11:21.176 --> 01:11:24.212
OK. If you need anything else,
I'll be right outside.

01:11:29.118 --> 01:11:31.062
Let's go. Open it.

01:11:38.661 --> 01:11:40.605
Very simple.

01:11:42.398 --> 01:11:44.342
Close it up.

01:11:46.135 --> 01:11:48.079
Call him.

01:11:48.103 --> 01:11:50.047
We're done in here.

01:12:06.822 --> 01:12:10.458
- Is everything OK, ma'am?
- Sonia, we've gotta hurry.

01:12:10.526 --> 01:12:13.394
We've gotta go
or we're gonna be late, huh.

01:12:13.462 --> 01:12:16.230
OK, well, if there's
nothing else I can do for you,

01:12:16.298 --> 01:12:18.466
you folks have a fine day.
We will.

01:12:21.403 --> 01:12:23.347
Thanks again.

01:12:27.276 --> 01:12:31.012
Drive.
You got what you wanted.

01:12:31.080 --> 01:12:34.682
Text your sister.
Change of plans.

01:12:34.750 --> 01:12:37.085
We're going to tell her in person.

01:12:37.186 --> 01:12:39.787
Now turn on the car and drive.

01:12:39.888 --> 01:12:42.090
Drive!

01:13:02.778 --> 01:13:05.680
Walk that way.

01:13:08.083 --> 01:13:10.952
Sit down and don't move.

01:13:15.424 --> 01:13:18.192
- Pull over. Right here.
- OK.

01:13:23.999 --> 01:13:25.943
Shut it off.

01:13:25.968 --> 01:13:28.503
Get out.

01:13:28.570 --> 01:13:31.472
Come on. Get out!
Against the car.

01:13:31.573 --> 01:13:33.574
Turn around. Turn around!

01:13:33.675 --> 01:13:35.910
OK! OK.

01:13:40.382 --> 01:13:42.383
It's my turn to drive.

01:14:04.940 --> 01:14:07.175
You crazy bitch!

01:14:07.276 --> 01:14:09.277
Sit down!

01:14:09.344 --> 01:14:11.212
Are you stupid?

01:14:11.280 --> 01:14:14.449
Do you want to die right here?

01:14:14.550 --> 01:14:17.518
Put that down.

01:14:17.619 --> 01:14:20.354
Don't move.

01:15:39.401 --> 01:15:41.536
They're here. Let's go.

01:15:56.218 --> 01:15:58.162
Get out.

01:16:00.122 --> 01:16:03.224
Chelsea.

01:16:03.292 --> 01:16:07.295
I am so sorry.

01:16:07.396 --> 01:16:09.830
Did you get the money?

01:16:09.932 --> 01:16:12.233
25.

01:16:12.334 --> 01:16:14.635
Just like she said.

01:16:14.736 --> 01:16:16.837
Plus a few other surprises too.

01:16:16.939 --> 01:16:18.773
Good. Let's get
the hell out of here.

01:16:18.874 --> 01:16:22.643
Sis, go get those shovels.

01:16:22.744 --> 01:16:25.046
What shovels?

01:16:25.147 --> 01:16:26.847
Right there.
Go get them. Do it!

01:16:26.949 --> 01:16:28.950
Go!

01:16:31.153 --> 01:16:34.088
Greg, what's going on?

01:16:34.189 --> 01:16:37.592
First thing these two are
gonna do is go to the cops.

01:16:37.693 --> 01:16:40.861
- No, I swear we won't.
- Shut your mouth.

01:16:46.134 --> 01:16:48.078
Stop here.

01:16:48.136 --> 01:16:50.638
Just cut them loose.

01:17:03.085 --> 01:17:05.186
Give them the shovels.

01:17:11.159 --> 01:17:13.394
Come here.

01:17:14.896 --> 01:17:18.132
Right here! Let's go!

01:17:18.233 --> 01:17:21.836
Start digging.

01:17:21.937 --> 01:17:24.905
Dig!
OK!

01:17:30.812 --> 01:17:34.148
You said we weren't gonna kill anybody.

01:17:34.249 --> 01:17:36.350
Yeah, well, I lied.
We don't have a choice.

01:17:38.353 --> 01:17:40.297
- Greg, think about...
- Shut up.

01:17:43.325 --> 01:17:46.360
Dig!

01:17:58.306 --> 01:18:01.909
What are we gonna do
when we get to South America?

01:18:02.010 --> 01:18:05.112
Sis, I told you,
I've got it all planned out.

01:18:09.852 --> 01:18:11.796
(screaming)

01:18:11.820 --> 01:18:14.955
What? What?

01:18:15.057 --> 01:18:18.025
Get your ass up, dig...

01:18:18.126 --> 01:18:20.194
What the... Greg?

01:18:20.295 --> 01:18:24.198
(panting and choking)
Get off him! Get off of him!

01:18:24.299 --> 01:18:26.867
You stay there.

01:18:26.968 --> 01:18:29.103
Chelsea! Stop. Don't move.

01:18:47.255 --> 01:18:49.990
Greg? Greg?

01:18:51.093 --> 01:18:54.729
(gunshots)

01:19:08.176 --> 01:19:10.177
Get behind the tree, quick!

01:19:14.316 --> 01:19:17.051
OK. I don't see her.

01:19:17.152 --> 01:19:20.054
- Is Greg dead?
- No, it was just a sedative,

01:19:20.155 --> 01:19:23.224
but only enough for a 90-pound dog.
He's not gonna be knocked out for long.

01:19:23.325 --> 01:19:26.794
- So what do we do? Keep going?
- No, just stay here. - OK.

01:19:39.174 --> 01:19:42.143
Lauren!

01:19:42.244 --> 01:19:45.212
You killed him, you stupid bitches!

01:19:45.313 --> 01:19:47.782
(gunshot)

01:20:01.997 --> 01:20:05.166
Stay still. All right?
I'm gonna put pressure

01:20:05.267 --> 01:20:07.768
on it to stop the bleeding.

01:20:07.869 --> 01:20:11.739
I don't want to die.

01:20:11.840 --> 01:20:14.008
Do you have a phone?

01:20:14.109 --> 01:20:16.777
In my pocket.

01:20:16.878 --> 01:20:19.180
Call 911.

01:20:30.091 --> 01:20:32.293
(gunshot)

01:20:38.834 --> 01:20:40.778
Are you OK?

01:20:42.237 --> 01:20:45.673
[911, may I help you?]

01:20:45.774 --> 01:20:47.942
Yes. I need the police
and paramedics.

01:20:48.043 --> 01:20:51.078
Two people have been shot
and I think one might be dead.

01:20:51.179 --> 01:20:54.281
[Any available units in the
Woodcrest area, please respond.]

01:20:54.382 --> 01:20:56.951
[Unit 38, copy that.]

01:21:07.395 --> 01:21:10.664
Chelsea, she's beautiful.

01:21:13.335 --> 01:21:15.769
Hey.

01:21:15.871 --> 01:21:18.906
Are you sure you want to do this?

01:21:19.007 --> 01:21:21.909
You can change your mind
if you want to.

01:21:22.010 --> 01:21:26.513
I want my baby to have
the best mom in the world.

01:21:26.615 --> 01:21:28.682
And right now I think that's you.

01:21:31.152 --> 01:21:33.120
You can see her any time you want.

01:21:36.157 --> 01:21:38.101
I think she needs a name.

01:21:40.229 --> 01:21:42.173
I want you to name her.

01:21:42.197 --> 01:21:45.532
Annette.

01:21:45.634 --> 01:21:47.635
After your grandmother.

01:21:52.674 --> 01:21:54.675
Thank you.

01:21:56.678 --> 01:21:58.746
- Hi!
- Miss Annette.

01:21:58.847 --> 01:22:01.215
Oh. Hey, guys.
Look who's here!

01:22:01.316 --> 01:22:03.617
- Sweetie.
- Hi.

01:22:03.718 --> 01:22:06.754
- How you feeling?
- A little tired, but I'm OK.

01:22:06.855 --> 01:22:09.790
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:22:09.891 --> 01:22:12.159
So good to see you.
Yeah, you too.

01:22:14.362 --> 01:22:16.997
I love you.
I love you too.

01:22:21.803 --> 01:22:24.071
OK. That's enough,
you two.

01:22:35.150 --> 01:22:37.094
Have you heard anything from Jeff?

01:22:37.152 --> 01:22:39.887
Nope! But Orin said
that he was fired

01:22:39.988 --> 01:22:42.056
from showing up to work late.

01:22:42.157 --> 01:22:44.725
I guess he's spending every
other weekend in Atlantic City.

01:22:44.826 --> 01:22:47.227
I don't know. I don't care.

01:22:47.329 --> 01:22:49.273
- What a loser.
- Yeah.

01:22:49.331 --> 01:22:52.666
But it looks like you've traded up.

01:22:52.767 --> 01:22:56.170
- Yeah, I have.
- Yeah.

01:22:56.271 --> 01:22:59.239
- Hey!
- Hi!

01:22:59.341 --> 01:23:01.709
So you ready to go?

01:23:01.810 --> 01:23:03.777
Traffic looks pretty bad
around the airport.

01:23:03.878 --> 01:23:06.113
We should probably get going.
Yeah.

01:23:06.214 --> 01:23:09.249
Chelsea, I want you to have
the best time in Germany.

01:23:09.351 --> 01:23:11.819
Thank you. I...

01:23:11.920 --> 01:23:13.864
I still can't believe I'm doing this.

01:23:13.922 --> 01:23:15.923
I can!

01:23:16.024 --> 01:23:19.560
Bye, Annie.

01:23:19.661 --> 01:23:22.930
Be good for your mama, OK?

01:23:23.031 --> 01:23:25.099
- Bye, sweetie.
- Bye.

01:23:25.200 --> 01:23:27.034
- I'll miss you.
- Miss you too.

01:23:27.135 --> 01:23:28.969
See you guys
in a few weeks. OK?

01:23:29.070 --> 01:23:31.014
- Bye.
- Bye.

01:23:31.106 --> 01:23:33.050
(baby cooing)

01:23:37.812 --> 01:23:40.180
Can you say
"bye-bye"?

01:23:43.051 --> 01:23:45.719
Say "bye-bye"!
