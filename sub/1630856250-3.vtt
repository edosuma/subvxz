00:06.966 --> 00:07.883
<i>Previously on</i> Reacher...

00:07.883 --> 00:08.884
<i>We're being followed.</i>

00:08.884 --> 00:10.094
NYPD?

00:10.094 --> 00:11.470
Gaitano Russo.

00:11.470 --> 00:13.597
He's the investigating officer
in Franz's homicide.

00:13.597 --> 00:15.182
<i>Franz was killed over
this hard drive.</i>

00:15.182 --> 00:17.184
It's just a list of names,
all starting with

00:17.184 --> 00:18.978
- the initials A.M.
- All aliases.

00:18.978 --> 00:20.980
We've got page after page
of random numbers.

00:20.980 --> 00:22.565
I'm thinking
there's someone hell-bent

00:22.565 --> 00:24.525
on taking out
the special investigators.

00:24.525 --> 00:25.901
They're headed towards
Atlantic City,

00:25.901 --> 00:27.319
probably gonna try to find
their missing buddies.

00:27.319 --> 00:29.697
<i>Good, all in
the same place at once.</i>

00:29.697 --> 00:32.032
Take them out.

00:33.534 --> 00:34.744
Should have left
one of them alive.

00:34.744 --> 00:37.955
Not necessarily.
Parking lot pass.

00:37.955 --> 00:39.582
"New Age Technologies."

00:39.582 --> 00:41.667
Do you know if Sanchez and
Orozco had any recent contact

00:41.667 --> 00:44.545
- with Calvin Franz?
- Actually, yeah, they were
working a case together.

00:44.545 --> 00:46.505
- Was Swan involved?
- I heard them mention his name.

00:46.505 --> 00:49.675
And the weapons,
all 650 will be in the truck.

00:49.675 --> 00:51.552
You can track the shipment
with the GPS locater

00:51.552 --> 00:52.970
I paired to this.

00:52.970 --> 00:54.722
Two more bodies
have been discovered

00:54.722 --> 00:56.348
in Upstate New York
near where they found

00:56.348 --> 00:57.558
your other friend.

00:57.558 --> 00:59.894
Pretty easy to ID him with that.

00:59.894 --> 01:01.312
We're gonna need more guns.

01:17.077 --> 01:18.704
Enough.

01:24.251 --> 01:28.047
This ends right now, Calvin,
if you want it to.

01:28.047 --> 01:30.466
Just tell me
what you figured out

01:30.466 --> 01:33.093
and who else knows it.

01:34.678 --> 01:37.306
We've already got a bead on
your buddies in Atlantic City,

01:37.306 --> 01:40.976
so you are not saving them
by not talking.

01:59.286 --> 02:00.871
Okay...

02:02.957 --> 02:04.834
...if you've got nothing to say.

02:40.661 --> 02:42.079
Get him ready.

03:29.209 --> 03:31.545
Last chance.

03:31.545 --> 03:35.633
You talk... or you fly, asshole.

03:41.388 --> 03:43.349
What's so funny?

03:43.349 --> 03:44.725
I'm just thinking...

03:46.185 --> 03:49.313
...about what the big guy's
gonna do to you.

04:11.669 --> 04:13.295
Big guy?

04:13.295 --> 04:15.589
Who the hell
was he talking about?

04:35.985 --> 04:39.321
I'll take the 17,
two 19s, that Beretta...

04:39.321 --> 04:40.990
and three burners.

04:42.533 --> 04:45.869
Well, just so you know...

04:45.869 --> 04:47.621
once you apply for your permit,

04:47.621 --> 04:49.707
there's a seven-day
waiting period

04:49.707 --> 04:51.875
before you can purchase
a firearm.

04:51.875 --> 04:53.836
You can't only buy one
in a 30-day window.

04:53.836 --> 04:55.379
But I can hold them for you.

04:55.379 --> 04:57.381
That's a lot of hoops.

04:57.381 --> 04:58.674
Well...

04:58.674 --> 05:00.509
more hoops than the NBA.

05:00.509 --> 05:03.387
Rules say you can lend
these firearms to a friend,

05:03.387 --> 05:05.514
which as you know,
is one of the conditions

05:05.514 --> 05:08.726
for a legal temporary transfer
under New Jersey law.

05:08.726 --> 05:10.436
Nice to meet you, friend.

05:10.436 --> 05:11.979
I'm Joe Gordon.

05:13.647 --> 05:15.816
Frank Majeske.
Pleasure's mine.

05:15.816 --> 05:18.694
And you must know that
a legal temporary transfer

05:18.694 --> 05:20.070
between family and friends

05:20.070 --> 05:21.780
can only be used
for sporting purposes,

05:21.780 --> 05:25.200
so I assume you're going
to be target shooting...

05:25.200 --> 05:27.786
or hunting?

05:27.786 --> 05:29.788
A combination of both.

05:29.788 --> 05:32.249
The law also necessitates
the firearms be back

05:32.249 --> 05:35.002
- within an eight-hour period.
- Technically,

05:35.002 --> 05:38.130
every moment in time exists
within an eight-hour period.

05:38.130 --> 05:40.507
I'm sure you're aware
that transferred firearms

05:40.507 --> 05:43.927
can only be used
in the presence and supervision

05:43.927 --> 05:47.014
of their legal owner
and that would be me.

05:50.559 --> 05:53.479
How about you be with me
in spirit, Frank?

05:55.439 --> 05:58.025
<i>♪ You say you got money ♪</i>

05:59.693 --> 06:02.112
<i>♪ Well, you better be sure...</i>

06:02.112 --> 06:04.239
well, if it's good enough for
God, it's good enough for me.

06:13.916 --> 06:16.335
<i>♪ I was a paperboy ♪</i>

06:16.335 --> 06:20.380
<i>♪ Back when
there was paperboys ♪</i>

06:21.381 --> 06:22.549
<i>♪ Bookstores and...</i>

06:22.549 --> 06:25.469
I don't know.
I like my Glock 17.

06:25.469 --> 06:27.471
That is a Glock 17.

06:27.471 --> 06:30.557
I said, "My Glock 17," okay?
I like the feel.

06:33.143 --> 06:35.020
- What was that?
- Oh, nothing.

06:35.020 --> 06:36.939
I'm just listening
to a .200 hitter

06:36.939 --> 06:38.107
complain about his new bat.

06:38.107 --> 06:39.942
Hey, I'm a great shot.

06:39.942 --> 06:41.693
You're average. At best.

06:41.693 --> 06:44.154
Bullshit.
Dixon, back me up here.

06:44.154 --> 06:46.740
- That time in Biloxi...
- Was the luckiest shot
I've ever seen.

06:46.740 --> 06:49.952
- Thank you.
- Man, you couldn't hit
a donkey's ass with a banjo.

06:49.952 --> 06:51.578
Screw you guys.

06:51.578 --> 06:54.957
All I'm saying is I want to use
my own personal sidearm, okay?

06:54.957 --> 06:58.335
One, a bad carpenter complains
about his tools.

06:58.335 --> 07:00.337
And two, you really
want to get busted

07:00.337 --> 07:02.464
shooting people with a gun
registered in your name?

07:02.464 --> 07:04.550
Fine, but I don't
got to like it.

07:04.550 --> 07:06.468
Well, I like mine.

07:06.468 --> 07:09.930
Beretta 92,
like Swan used to carry.

07:09.930 --> 07:11.890
<i>♪ You got a marketing plan...</i>

07:11.890 --> 07:13.725
You know,
these guys we're going after

07:13.725 --> 07:16.478
have to be pretty good
to have taken down four of us.

07:16.478 --> 07:18.689
We don't know Swan's dead.
Not for sure.

07:18.689 --> 07:20.524
Swan's as dead as his dog.

07:20.524 --> 07:23.527
What? We all know it.

07:23.527 --> 07:26.697
And if it pisses you off
as much as it does me...

07:26.697 --> 07:28.240
that's good.

07:28.240 --> 07:29.616
I think
I found what we need.

07:29.616 --> 07:31.743
The Jade East Motel.
Belt Parkway.

07:31.743 --> 07:33.162
It's perfect.

07:33.162 --> 07:35.914
Hump joint near the airport,
affairs, prostitution...

07:35.914 --> 07:38.792
No one's looking to get into
anyone else's business there.

07:38.792 --> 07:40.419
Good place to hide out.

07:40.419 --> 07:42.421
I don't know, Reacher.

07:42.421 --> 07:44.298
You okay with staying
somewhere so fancy?

07:46.675 --> 07:48.594
Any reason I shouldn't
pull over?

07:49.636 --> 07:51.805
Let's get it over with.

08:24.087 --> 08:26.340
You four... wait here.

08:32.095 --> 08:34.806
That was weird.

08:34.806 --> 08:37.226
I wasn't going fast enough
to be pulled over.

08:37.226 --> 08:39.102
I know.

08:39.102 --> 08:40.520
You think anyone found out
about the friends

08:40.520 --> 08:41.813
you and Dixon made
in Atlantic City?

08:41.813 --> 08:43.899
Not unless they decided
to re-pour concrete.

08:43.899 --> 08:46.735
Oh, maybe the pawnshop owner
set the cops on our tail.

08:46.735 --> 08:48.737
He gets our money
and his guns back.

08:48.737 --> 08:51.114
He's an accomplice.
He burns us, he burns himself.

08:52.449 --> 08:53.659
Hold my gun.

08:56.745 --> 08:58.789
Wake me up if something happens.

08:58.789 --> 09:00.999
Whoa, you're taking a nap
right now?

09:00.999 --> 09:02.251
I'm gonna be arrested,

09:02.251 --> 09:04.544
but I got a feeling
it's gonna take a while.

09:04.544 --> 09:06.046
So...

09:06.046 --> 09:07.756
sleep when you can.

09:32.364 --> 09:33.532
Hey, Slugger?

09:33.532 --> 09:34.992
Get out.

09:36.118 --> 09:37.995
I'll pay you back
the bail money.

09:37.995 --> 09:39.997
Don't forget the room.
And the plane ticket.

09:39.997 --> 09:41.415
What are you
waiting for?

09:41.415 --> 09:42.708
Get out.

09:44.251 --> 09:47.170
Hands on the roof, Paul Bunyan.

09:47.170 --> 09:49.256
Neagley, Dixon...

09:49.256 --> 09:51.508
handle that parking pass matter.

09:51.508 --> 09:53.135
O'Donnell?

09:54.219 --> 09:55.345
How can I be of service?

09:55.345 --> 09:56.930
You went to law school, right?

09:56.930 --> 09:58.348
Yeah. Rutgers.

09:58.348 --> 09:59.599
So... kind of.

09:59.599 --> 10:00.892
You can kiss my ass.

10:00.892 --> 10:02.894
- This guy's my lawyer.
- Good for you.

10:02.894 --> 10:04.563
Shit.

10:04.563 --> 10:08.525
Detective, my client's
requested counsel.

10:08.525 --> 10:10.360
If you separate us
during transport,

10:10.360 --> 10:11.945
you'll be creating
a contestable issue

10:11.945 --> 10:14.114
that I assure you
I will win on appeal

10:14.114 --> 10:17.034
in the slim chance a conviction
actually comes to pass.

10:17.034 --> 10:18.452
None of that is
remotely accurate.

10:18.452 --> 10:21.079
We can agree to disagree.

10:21.079 --> 10:23.040
Rutgers.

10:26.043 --> 10:28.128
Get in the car, Dershowitz.

10:35.177 --> 10:36.762
How'd you find us?

10:36.762 --> 10:39.723
I drove around looking for the
car with a giant asshole in it.

10:39.723 --> 10:42.601
- Guess they spotted you.
- Well, if you must know,

10:42.601 --> 10:45.979
I knew you guys would get scarce
once I was unjustly assaulted,

10:45.979 --> 10:47.814
so I pulled
all the security footage

10:47.814 --> 10:49.858
from the car rental
companies at the airport,

10:49.858 --> 10:52.027
scrubbed them
until I saw you talking

10:52.027 --> 10:53.487
to that number
in the business suit.

10:53.487 --> 10:56.031
Pulled the plate off
her rental car,

10:56.031 --> 10:58.075
put a BOLO out
so I know if and when

10:58.075 --> 10:59.910
you guys got back to New York.

10:59.910 --> 11:03.747
Cruiser car spotted you and
here we are, you fucking genius.

11:07.918 --> 11:09.503
Why do you have toys back here?

11:09.503 --> 11:11.380
Hey, put that away.

11:11.380 --> 11:12.422
Oh, is this your icebreakers

11:12.422 --> 11:13.590
for the kiddies
on the playground?

11:13.590 --> 11:15.342
That ain't even funny.

11:15.342 --> 11:16.885
What's with the bag, Russo?

11:16.885 --> 11:19.346
It's a bag of
none of your fucking business.

11:19.346 --> 11:21.556
So feel free
to root around in there,

11:21.556 --> 11:23.892
grab a handful of none
of your fucking business,

11:23.892 --> 11:26.478
and shove it up your ass.

11:26.478 --> 11:28.814
Nice place.

11:28.814 --> 11:30.232
Yeah.

11:30.232 --> 11:32.609
I like a lobby you can hold
an IndyCar event in.

11:34.194 --> 11:37.364
Frances Neagley, Karla Dixon?

11:37.364 --> 11:40.784
I'm Marlo Burns.
New Age Director of Operations.

11:40.784 --> 11:42.744
Not my thing,
but nice to meet you.

11:42.744 --> 11:44.329
Oh, okay.

11:44.329 --> 11:48.375
Well, we don't often get visits
from private investigators.

11:48.375 --> 11:50.377
- Is everything all right?
- We're looking into

11:50.377 --> 11:52.629
three confirmed murders
and a missing person,

11:52.629 --> 11:54.131
so I'm gonna go ahead
and say no.

11:54.131 --> 11:56.466
This parking pass was found

11:56.466 --> 11:58.718
in a person of interest's car.

11:58.718 --> 12:00.137
We were hoping you could provide

12:00.137 --> 12:01.680
more information about
who it was issued to.

12:01.680 --> 12:04.391
New Age has
over a thousand employees

12:04.391 --> 12:06.226
with dozens of divisions.

12:06.226 --> 12:09.354
We have countless visitors
coming here every day

12:09.354 --> 12:12.774
regarding the scores of
projects we're developing.

12:12.774 --> 12:14.943
Look...

12:14.943 --> 12:17.154
We understand, but any
information you could give us

12:17.154 --> 12:18.572
would be greatly appreciated.

12:18.572 --> 12:20.991
This isn't just
any case we're working on.

12:20.991 --> 12:22.117
The, uh...

12:22.117 --> 12:24.536
The victims happened to be
our friends.

12:27.038 --> 12:28.540
I'm so sorry.

12:30.792 --> 12:32.544
I'll see what I can find.

12:32.544 --> 12:34.212
Thank you.

12:38.467 --> 12:40.886
- You want to have a seat?
- You want to tell us
what this is about?

12:40.886 --> 12:43.847
- Besides your bruised face?
- I think it's more about
his bruised ego.

12:43.847 --> 12:45.891
For the record,
that was a sucker punch, okay?

12:45.891 --> 12:47.726
Technically, the airbag
sucker punched you.

12:47.726 --> 12:48.935
I beat you up.

12:48.935 --> 12:51.271
Fair fight,
I'll turn your lights out.

12:51.271 --> 12:53.899
And when this is all over,
we're gonna go again

12:53.899 --> 12:55.775
and I'm gonna beat your ass
to the ground.

12:55.775 --> 12:57.777
Well, why don't you just
take off the cuffs,

12:57.777 --> 12:59.738
rescind the arrest and you guys
can settle it right here?

12:59.738 --> 13:01.239
What kind of lawyer are you?

13:01.239 --> 13:02.782
The best the 91st-ranked
law school

13:02.782 --> 13:04.326
in the country can produce.

13:04.326 --> 13:06.203
Look, Curly,

13:06.203 --> 13:07.954
you want to tell why I'm in here

13:07.954 --> 13:09.873
instead of being
processed out there?

13:11.500 --> 13:13.752
- I got bad news.
- Let me guess.

13:13.752 --> 13:15.962
Our friends Sanchez
and Orozco are dead.

13:15.962 --> 13:17.797
Kidnapped
and bodies found Upstate.

13:17.797 --> 13:19.549
I heard directly
from the Catskill P.D.

13:19.549 --> 13:20.967
How the hell
you guys know about that?

13:20.967 --> 13:22.886
Guess we're just two steps
ahead of you, Sipowicz.

13:22.886 --> 13:24.304
No, you're not
two steps ahead of me

13:24.304 --> 13:25.889
if you're working this case.

13:25.889 --> 13:29.267
You are actively interfering
with my investigation.

13:29.267 --> 13:31.228
And if you want me to arrest you
and put you in the tombs,

13:31.228 --> 13:32.395
I can make that happen,

13:32.395 --> 13:34.397
but that's not gonna solve
these murders.

13:34.397 --> 13:36.441
And me and you both
wanting that,

13:36.441 --> 13:38.568
is the one thing
we have in common.

13:40.737 --> 13:42.989
Fair enough.

13:44.032 --> 13:45.825
Why don't you start with
a show of good faith

13:45.825 --> 13:47.953
and explain why
you were tailing us?

13:47.953 --> 13:49.704
Okay.

13:49.704 --> 13:51.665
When I looked into the 110th,

13:51.665 --> 13:55.460
Calvin Franz's phone logs
had multiple calls to you,

13:55.460 --> 13:57.712
Tony Swan, Jorge Sanchez,

13:57.712 --> 13:59.422
Manuel Orozco,

13:59.422 --> 14:01.383
but he didn't call you, though.

14:01.383 --> 14:02.634
Why's that?

14:02.634 --> 14:04.427
I don't have a phone.

14:07.681 --> 14:10.809
You guys were
in the same unit for years.

14:10.809 --> 14:12.644
Now you're all being killed off.

14:13.687 --> 14:16.439
Something is going on and
I think you guys know things.

14:19.276 --> 14:21.945
Look, I just want to get
to the bottom of this shit.

14:27.117 --> 14:29.411
If we share what we've got...

14:29.411 --> 14:31.871
you better have
something for us in return.

14:35.083 --> 14:37.586
I found something.

14:37.586 --> 14:40.714
Our records show
that parking pass 6322

14:40.714 --> 14:43.633
was issued to a man named
Trevor Saropian.

14:43.633 --> 14:46.261
He's not an employee.
He was here for an interview.

14:46.261 --> 14:47.804
Interview for what?

14:47.804 --> 14:49.598
Apparently, he runs
an office maintenance company.

14:49.598 --> 14:52.892
Washing windows, waxing floors,
that kind of thing.

14:52.892 --> 14:54.144
We didn't hire him.

14:54.144 --> 14:55.895
It was too small
an operation for our needs.

14:55.895 --> 14:58.231
But his resume
was still on file

14:58.231 --> 15:00.317
with his address.

15:05.697 --> 15:07.991
Thank you, sincerely.

15:07.991 --> 15:11.161
Did a murderer really
come here for a job interview?

15:11.161 --> 15:13.246
That's what
we're gonna find out.

15:22.339 --> 15:24.215
Six hundred and fifty
at $100K.

15:24.215 --> 15:27.385
What the hell is being sold
that's worth $65 million?

15:27.385 --> 15:28.762
A sale's an assumption,

15:28.762 --> 15:31.765
and in an investigation,
assumptions kill.

15:31.765 --> 15:33.808
It could be a transfer
of $65 million,

15:33.808 --> 15:35.393
a $65 million cover-up,

15:35.393 --> 15:37.395
a $65 million bribe.

15:37.395 --> 15:39.356
Well, whatever your friends
were involved in,

15:39.356 --> 15:41.483
it was big enough
to get them killed.

15:41.483 --> 15:44.569
Not sure I like your use
of the word "involved" there.

15:44.569 --> 15:45.987
Involved means involved.

15:45.987 --> 15:47.572
Read into it any way you want.

15:47.572 --> 15:50.700
I'm reading an insinuation
that my friends are criminals,

15:50.700 --> 15:52.243
and if my read's correct,

15:52.243 --> 15:54.371
you and I are gonna have
another problem.

15:54.371 --> 15:55.580
I'm a detective.

15:55.580 --> 15:57.123
I got to be open
to all the possibilities,

15:57.123 --> 15:58.792
even the ones
you might not like.

15:58.792 --> 16:01.753
Well, there's one possibility
I've been very open to

16:01.753 --> 16:03.296
that it's you who's in on this.

16:03.296 --> 16:04.881
I'm no dirty cop.

16:04.881 --> 16:06.883
You followed us without
ever identifying yourself,

16:06.883 --> 16:08.343
and you brought us in here
to find out what we know,

16:08.343 --> 16:09.969
but never formally arrested me.

16:09.969 --> 16:12.013
Seems like you want to
keep things off the books.

16:12.013 --> 16:13.848
Say I'm dirty again,
see what happens.

16:13.848 --> 16:15.350
Tough talk when I'm cuffed.

16:21.147 --> 16:24.192
I don't take envelopes.
You got that?

16:26.569 --> 16:28.697
Gentlemen,
why don't we all just

16:28.697 --> 16:31.449
take a big, you know...
big breath,

16:31.449 --> 16:34.327
and we just go
to our respective corners.

16:36.746 --> 16:38.164
And, uh, Detective.

16:38.915 --> 16:40.250
A great way to demonstrate

16:40.250 --> 16:42.293
your integrity would be
to share some intel with us

16:42.293 --> 16:44.254
that we don't already know.

16:49.718 --> 16:51.136
We got a suspect.

16:52.762 --> 16:53.930
How'd you find him?

16:53.930 --> 16:55.473
Printer in Franz's office.

16:55.473 --> 16:57.142
We searched
that office ourselves.

16:57.142 --> 16:58.143
Printer was smashed
on the ground.

16:58.143 --> 16:59.310
Nothing in the output tray.

16:59.310 --> 17:01.479
But the memory card
was intact.

17:01.479 --> 17:03.148
I had the tech geeks
look it over.

17:03.148 --> 17:05.525
They found an unfinished job
in the queue.

17:05.525 --> 17:08.319
It didn't print due to low ink.

17:08.319 --> 17:11.906
Maybe you're not the only
good investigator in the room.

17:13.908 --> 17:15.410
Azhari Mahmoud?

17:15.410 --> 17:17.620
He's known to INTERPOL
as a weapons broker

17:17.620 --> 17:19.122
for terrorist organizations.

17:19.122 --> 17:21.082
"Mahmoud could be
who we're looking for.

17:21.082 --> 17:23.585
He's a ghost.
No pictures of him anywhere.

17:23.585 --> 17:24.836
Sanchez."

17:24.836 --> 17:27.881
Sanchez and Orozco
dug this guy up for Franz.

17:29.799 --> 17:32.177
A.M. It's same initials.

17:32.177 --> 17:33.720
Same initials as what?

17:33.720 --> 17:35.138
The list of aliases we found

17:35.138 --> 17:37.682
on a flash drive
that belonged to Franz.

17:37.682 --> 17:40.935
This guy's name most likely
isn't Azhari Mahmoud.

17:40.935 --> 17:42.896
You were never going
to mention that?

17:42.896 --> 17:46.691
You're gonna want DHS to flag
all of his aliases.

18:03.249 --> 18:04.584
You think the guys
got wrapped up

18:04.584 --> 18:06.085
in something
involving terrorism?

18:08.213 --> 18:09.631
Maybe.

18:13.301 --> 18:16.346
Well...

18:16.346 --> 18:18.765
whatever it is,
this case just got

18:18.765 --> 18:21.351
a whole lot bigger
than what we thought it was.

18:22.685 --> 18:24.229
Been known to happen.

18:28.358 --> 18:30.401
We're gonna need to pull
Neagley and the others

18:30.401 --> 18:33.071
- off that arson case.
- What?

18:33.071 --> 18:35.657
Come on, this is a
bar brawl gone wrong.

18:35.657 --> 18:37.700
This guy probably had
a few too many soda pops,

18:37.700 --> 18:41.079
got handsy with some guy's girl,
push, shove, come outside,

18:41.079 --> 18:42.413
bang, bang.

18:43.623 --> 18:45.583
It could be a stamp from a club,

18:45.583 --> 18:47.293
like you get outside a door.

18:47.293 --> 18:50.129
Except, uh, on his palm.

18:50.129 --> 18:52.757
Yeah, they don't stamp
at this place anyways.

18:52.757 --> 18:55.593
- You asked?
- No. Been here a few times.

18:55.593 --> 18:57.679
- What'd you find out?
- We showed pictures
of Private Simms

18:57.679 --> 18:59.389
to all the employees.

18:59.389 --> 19:00.849
No one recognized him,

19:00.849 --> 19:04.143
which might not mean much
in a dark, crowded bar,

19:04.143 --> 19:05.395
but he definitely
wasn't involved

19:05.395 --> 19:06.813
in some fight that led to this.

19:06.813 --> 19:09.899
- Full sweep?
- Hit every inch of the place.

19:09.899 --> 19:11.192
And it wasn't easy

19:11.192 --> 19:13.778
'cause the ladies were
barely letting me get by.

19:13.778 --> 19:15.488
Somehow they can always tell
I'm a great dancer.

19:15.488 --> 19:18.074
Yeah, but once Baryshnikov here
got past his fans,

19:18.074 --> 19:19.450
it was pretty obvious

19:19.450 --> 19:21.244
there wasn't an altercation
in here tonight.

19:21.244 --> 19:22.871
That's 'cause
he was never in that bar.

19:22.871 --> 19:25.331
His pant cuffs are wet.

19:25.331 --> 19:27.876
Couple potholes back there are
filled with last night's rain.

19:27.876 --> 19:29.752
He was running for his life,

19:29.752 --> 19:31.880
cut through this lot,
splashed a pothole,

19:31.880 --> 19:33.464
got slowed down,
got popped in the back.

19:33.464 --> 19:35.884
- Died right here.
- Yeah,
but what about the stamp?

19:36.926 --> 19:38.136
It was transferred off something

19:38.136 --> 19:39.554
he was holding onto
while he ran.

19:39.554 --> 19:41.556
Look how the ink smudged.

19:41.556 --> 19:43.725
It came off a glassine wrapper.

19:43.725 --> 19:46.561
- He stole someone's drugs?
- A kite.

19:46.561 --> 19:48.271
'Cause it gets you high.

19:53.985 --> 19:56.154
- Lieutenant Colonel.
- Oh, cut the shit, Reacher.

19:56.154 --> 19:57.989
I'm in Wranglers,
for Christ sake.

19:57.989 --> 19:59.157
Copy that.

19:59.157 --> 20:00.783
So what brings you
out here, Fields?

20:00.783 --> 20:04.162
I heard the call while I was out
buying ice cream and pretzels.

20:04.162 --> 20:07.498
- How far along now?
- Eight and half months in.
She's craving salty and sweet.

20:07.498 --> 20:09.459
I was around the corner
at the Wawa,

20:09.459 --> 20:11.044
figured I'd swing by
before I headed home

20:11.044 --> 20:12.545
to the missus
and little Hortense.

20:12.545 --> 20:14.422
You name your kid after you?

20:15.465 --> 20:18.468
Technically,
after my father, but yes...

20:18.468 --> 20:20.720
it's the family curse.

20:20.720 --> 20:22.347
So, what do we have here?

20:22.347 --> 20:25.350
The ever-winning combination
of booze, men and guns?

20:25.350 --> 20:27.393
Replace booze with drugs.

20:27.393 --> 20:29.979
From the looks of it,
Private Simms stole some,

20:29.979 --> 20:31.814
- ran, and got caught.
- You think?

20:31.814 --> 20:33.691
Kid from our base
stealing drugs?

20:33.691 --> 20:34.817
I don't want
to assume,

20:34.817 --> 20:36.903
assumptions kill,

20:36.903 --> 20:38.696
but it's what
my instincts are telling me.

20:39.781 --> 20:43.451
Well, this is what the
110th was created for, right?

20:43.451 --> 20:45.244
You and your team open a file
and dig in.

20:45.244 --> 20:46.371
Keep me updated

20:46.371 --> 20:48.456
if there's anything
I can do to help.

20:48.456 --> 20:50.124
For now...

20:50.124 --> 20:51.960
my butter pecan's melting.

20:51.960 --> 20:53.711
Roger that.

20:56.798 --> 20:59.550
Swan, you were half right.
It's not just a kite.

20:59.550 --> 21:01.260
It's a fighter kite.

21:01.260 --> 21:04.347
Saw these all the time
in Afghanistan.

21:04.347 --> 21:07.392
Kite fighting's popular there...

21:07.392 --> 21:09.936
...so is heroin production.

21:09.936 --> 21:11.270
Dixon?

21:11.270 --> 21:13.606
- Boss?
- The aviation fuel case.

21:13.606 --> 21:15.066
Let's pull that file.

21:15.066 --> 21:18.653
I might know what was weighing
down all those planes.

21:22.198 --> 21:23.533
You're quiet.

21:23.533 --> 21:25.284
Whatcha thinking?

21:27.954 --> 21:29.455
I'm thinking
I have the name of someone

21:29.455 --> 21:31.874
who killed some of
the best people I know.

21:31.874 --> 21:35.336
I'm thinking you're gonna
figure out those numbers,

21:35.336 --> 21:36.921
we're gonna find those fuckers
and they're gonna learn

21:36.921 --> 21:40.925
exactly why you do not mess
with the special investigators.

21:43.720 --> 21:45.054
Reacher sure knew
what he was doing

21:45.054 --> 21:46.514
when he put us together,
didn't he?

21:46.514 --> 21:49.017
Guy's got good instincts.

21:49.017 --> 21:52.395
- Guy's got good everything.
- Ew.

21:52.395 --> 21:54.397
I'm just saying.

21:54.397 --> 21:57.316
Never thought I'd have
the chance to find out.

21:57.316 --> 22:00.570
Please. Everyone saw that coming
like Halley's comet.

22:00.570 --> 22:02.030
I didn't.

22:02.030 --> 22:04.866
I honestly thought
he wasn't interested.

22:04.866 --> 22:07.285
He keeps everybody
at a distance except you.

22:07.285 --> 22:10.413
That's just 'cause
I don't press the issue.

22:10.413 --> 22:12.165
I like how we are.

22:12.165 --> 22:14.834
Distance is... comfortable.

22:14.834 --> 22:17.128
And yet you two are the closest
in the 110th.

22:17.128 --> 22:18.838
So, how'd that happen?

22:18.838 --> 22:21.591
Honestly? No idea.

22:21.591 --> 22:25.178
But I do know
even when days, months,

22:25.178 --> 22:27.305
even years go by
without us speaking,

22:27.305 --> 22:29.015
Reacher'll be there
when I need him.

22:29.015 --> 22:31.476
- No questions asked.
- Oh, my God.

22:32.643 --> 22:34.645
That's it.

22:34.645 --> 22:38.357
- It's days and months.
- What is?

22:38.357 --> 22:40.318
Those pages?

22:41.611 --> 22:42.987
There's seven sheets, right?

22:42.987 --> 22:46.491
On each sheet there's 26
or 27 numerical tabulations.

22:46.491 --> 22:48.743
- If you say so.
- I mean, if you run them
all together,

22:48.743 --> 22:51.788
you could fit everything
on one page instead of seven,

22:51.788 --> 22:54.832
but clearly, they wanted seven.

22:54.832 --> 22:58.920
So knowing that each page is
a specific calculation of data,

22:58.920 --> 23:01.631
it makes it even more relevant
that all of the pages have 26,

23:01.631 --> 23:03.007
except for one.

23:03.007 --> 23:05.593
One has 27. Why?

23:05.593 --> 23:08.805
I've understood nothing
since you said, "Oh, my God."

23:08.805 --> 23:10.640
It's days and months, right?

23:10.640 --> 23:12.850
Each page is a month.
Seven of them.

23:12.850 --> 23:15.061
But not every month
has the same amount of days.

23:15.061 --> 23:16.938
But if you work six days a week,

23:16.938 --> 23:20.149
that total's 26 or 27 days,

23:20.149 --> 23:22.735
depending on which day
that particular month starts

23:22.735 --> 23:25.029
- or ends on.
- Right.

23:25.029 --> 23:27.907
But based on those working days,
it's not just any seven months.

23:27.907 --> 23:30.910
It's... actually,
the last seven months.

23:30.910 --> 23:33.746
So the last seven months,

23:33.746 --> 23:37.375
something was supposed to happen
nine or ten or 12

23:37.375 --> 23:39.377
or 13 times a day,
Monday through Saturday,

23:39.377 --> 23:41.337
but it didn't always
come out right.

23:41.337 --> 23:43.506
It's not just that it didn't
always come out right.

23:43.506 --> 23:47.426
I mean, those numbers went
from pretty good in month one

23:47.426 --> 23:49.387
to abysmal in month seven.

23:49.387 --> 23:51.722
So the real question is,

23:51.722 --> 23:54.142
what kind of somethings
were they counting?

23:55.143 --> 23:57.562
[groans] I mean,
you should've seen it.

23:57.562 --> 23:59.605
Through half inch
chain-link fence,

23:59.605 --> 24:02.525
across the yard,
underneath the porch rail,

24:02.525 --> 24:04.318
dead center into the bolt lock.

24:04.318 --> 24:06.445
Biloxi police chief said
it was the most incredible shot

24:06.445 --> 24:08.322
- he'd ever seen.
- I agree.

24:08.322 --> 24:11.117
It's like Mr. Magoo finally
finding the staircase.

24:11.117 --> 24:13.244
Eat shit.

24:13.244 --> 24:14.745
Good news.

24:14.745 --> 24:17.999
Put the aliases you gave me
into the system,

24:17.999 --> 24:19.417
we got a recent hit
on this A.M. guy.

24:19.417 --> 24:22.128
Recent like right now
in the United States recent?

24:22.128 --> 24:23.462
Oh, yeah.

24:23.462 --> 24:25.756
And one of the names on
the list, Alexander Markopoulos,

24:25.756 --> 24:28.718
just bought a ticket
for a flight from Denver to JFK

24:28.718 --> 24:29.927
that boards in an hour.

24:29.927 --> 24:31.971
Soon as A.M. checks in,
we got him.

25:29.111 --> 25:30.238
Oh.

25:30.238 --> 25:31.948
I'm so sorry about that.

25:36.077 --> 25:37.370
All right.

25:40.122 --> 25:41.290
Yeah.

25:41.290 --> 25:43.501
<i>[over phone] I've
been delayed.</i>

25:43.501 --> 25:45.544
Delayed?
What do you mean "delayed"?

25:45.544 --> 25:47.713
Do I really have to define
the word delayed for you?

25:47.713 --> 25:50.383
I'll still be there,
just a bit later than expected.

25:50.383 --> 25:53.261
Authorities were waiting
for me at the airport.

25:55.263 --> 25:56.597
Are you sure?

25:56.597 --> 26:00.184
People don't normally travel
with empty suitcases.

26:00.184 --> 26:02.436
My IDs are burned.

26:02.436 --> 26:04.480
<i>How much
do you think they know?</i>

26:04.480 --> 26:05.773
I didn't stop to ask.

26:05.773 --> 26:07.525
<i>But if there was
a clear link between us,</i>

26:07.525 --> 26:09.610
<i>you'd be speaking to your lawyer
right now instead of me.</i>

26:09.610 --> 26:11.821
Well, you're supposedly
the expert on all this.

26:11.821 --> 26:13.072
We had a deal.

26:13.072 --> 26:14.824
And I'm keeping my end of it.

26:14.824 --> 26:16.534
I will just be a touch late.

26:16.534 --> 26:18.160
<i>"Late" can blow
this whole thing up.</i>

26:18.160 --> 26:20.121
Every minute
we don't close this deal

26:20.121 --> 26:21.580
is a minute more
that we're exposed

26:21.580 --> 26:23.666
and a minute closer to us all
being in federal prison.

26:23.666 --> 26:27.003
Mr. Langston, a question.

26:27.003 --> 26:29.088
Have you done
a deal like this before?

26:29.088 --> 26:31.090
<i>For the type of product
being purchased</i>

26:31.090 --> 26:33.426
<i>at the price offered?</i>

26:33.426 --> 26:34.677
No.

26:34.677 --> 26:37.388
I have. Multiple times.

26:38.889 --> 26:40.057
Like you Americans say,

26:40.057 --> 26:42.810
<i>this is not my first rodeo.</i>

26:42.810 --> 26:45.438
All right, we'll keep things
moving forward on our end.

26:45.438 --> 26:49.483
<i>But how are you gonna get
into New York without an ID?</i>

26:54.613 --> 26:55.781
I'll handle it.

27:00.077 --> 27:01.912
<i>♪ In you ♪</i>

27:01.912 --> 27:03.331
Months and days.

27:03.331 --> 27:05.291
<i>♪ I see ♪</i>

27:05.291 --> 27:07.001
<i>♪ For me...</i>

27:07.001 --> 27:08.711
Shit, she's right.

27:08.711 --> 27:11.297
Of course she's right.
It's numbers.

27:15.593 --> 27:17.428
Here we are.

27:17.428 --> 27:19.889
Saropian's home sweet home.

27:19.889 --> 27:22.641
Can you get me some info
on that house next door?

27:22.641 --> 27:24.393
- On it.
- Isn't this all just moot

27:24.393 --> 27:27.146
if A.M.'s being picked up
at the airport as we speak?

27:27.146 --> 27:28.230
And if he keeps his mouth shut,

27:28.230 --> 27:29.482
we never learn
who he's working with

27:29.482 --> 27:31.067
and everyone else involved
gets away with it.

27:31.067 --> 27:32.401
Barbara Gottelsman.

27:32.401 --> 27:35.363
She's 79, so... be nice.

27:35.363 --> 27:36.864
Why wouldn't I be nice?

27:39.367 --> 27:41.035
<i>[over phone] Hello?</i>

27:41.035 --> 27:43.746
Hello, is this Miss Gottelsman
of 950 Emerson Drive?

27:43.746 --> 27:45.039
<i>Yes.</i>

27:45.039 --> 27:47.541
I found Trevor Saropian's
wallet on the sidewalk.

27:47.541 --> 27:49.877
ID puts him at 948 Emerson,

27:49.877 --> 27:51.337
but I wanted to make sure
he still lives there

27:51.337 --> 27:52.755
before I mailed it back

27:52.755 --> 27:55.257
since no one's answering
the number I found for him.

27:55.257 --> 27:59.804
His ID lists him as five-nine,
picture has a scar on his face.

27:59.804 --> 28:02.014
<i>Yes, that's Trevor.</i>

28:02.014 --> 28:03.516
Okay.

28:03.516 --> 28:05.518
<i>- </i>  Sorry to bother you.
<i>- You know,</i>

28:05.518 --> 28:08.979
<i>his trash cans have been
on the curb for days now.</i>

28:08.979 --> 28:11.857
<i>He's supposed to bring them in
the day after collection</i>

28:11.857 --> 28:14.944
<i>or it's a $20 fine per can.</i>

28:14.944 --> 28:18.322
Yeah, he's not bringing
those cans back in.

28:19.323 --> 28:21.534
So it's actually his house.

28:21.534 --> 28:22.952
Should we go see
what we can find?

28:22.952 --> 28:25.830
Right after we make a stop
at the hardware store.

32:24.652 --> 32:27.237
Donkey's ass, meet banjo.

32:29.281 --> 32:31.700
Fucking bulletproof vests.

32:45.464 --> 32:47.508
All clear upstairs?

32:47.508 --> 32:49.760
Other than this
asshole's dead buddy,

32:49.760 --> 32:51.845
all clear upstairs.

33:11.740 --> 33:12.908
Oh, shit!

33:34.555 --> 33:36.640
Reacher!

33:36.640 --> 33:37.725
West!

34:18.682 --> 34:21.059
Who sent you?

34:22.019 --> 34:23.604
Who sent you?!

34:26.732 --> 34:28.650
Brian Collins.

34:29.276 --> 34:30.652
Who do you work for?

34:30.652 --> 34:34.531
New Age?
Do you work at New Age?

34:35.574 --> 34:36.950
Are you having a heart attack?

34:40.078 --> 34:41.580
You got to be kidding me.

34:41.580 --> 34:44.500
Hey! Collins!

34:44.500 --> 34:46.668
Who's running this operation?

34:46.668 --> 34:47.961
Collins!

34:54.551 --> 34:55.969
Really?

34:58.555 --> 34:59.765
Asshole.

35:05.479 --> 35:07.105
Evening, Mrs. Gottelsman.

35:08.148 --> 35:09.483
Oh.

35:13.487 --> 35:16.365
You're alone.
Have to assume no survivors?

35:16.365 --> 35:17.574
No.

35:17.574 --> 35:19.743
Guy in the car was from New Age.

35:19.743 --> 35:21.036
Found an ID.

35:21.036 --> 35:22.162
Well, I'm glad
you found something

35:22.162 --> 35:24.081
'cause these guys
ain't got jack shit.

35:24.081 --> 35:25.332
Outside muscle.

35:25.332 --> 35:26.583
Guy I just left dead was here

35:26.583 --> 35:27.918
to make sure
they got the job done.

35:27.918 --> 35:30.254
- What now?
- We get the hell out of here.

35:30.254 --> 35:32.965
Pretty sure Mrs. Gottelsman
has called the cops by now.

35:41.640 --> 35:43.851
Bet you wish you had
a change of clothes now, huh?

35:43.851 --> 35:45.853
One pair of slacks, Jack?

35:45.853 --> 35:47.729
I wouldn't get too comfortable.

35:47.729 --> 35:49.565
I have a feeling the night's
not done with us yet.

35:52.192 --> 35:54.027
- You were saying?
- A lot of angry

35:54.027 --> 35:56.780
and a lot of bald
is about to blow into town.

35:58.657 --> 36:00.576
- Evening, Russo.
- Close the door.

36:00.576 --> 36:02.369
A pipe bomb?

36:02.369 --> 36:04.538
In suburban fucking Queens?

36:04.538 --> 36:07.124
- They frown upon
that sort of thing?
- You think this is funny?

36:07.124 --> 36:08.750
What were you thinking?

36:08.750 --> 36:11.086
We were thinking
we were being set up,

36:11.086 --> 36:13.130
and as it turns out,
we were right.

36:13.130 --> 36:14.673
Set up how?

36:14.673 --> 36:16.717
There were hit men who tried
to kill us in Atlantic City.

36:16.717 --> 36:18.260
They failed.

36:18.260 --> 36:20.804
But they had a parking pass
for a company called New Age.

36:20.804 --> 36:22.264
So, you were you never
going to mention that?

36:22.264 --> 36:24.641
While O'Donnell and I were
being unlawfully detained

36:24.641 --> 36:27.352
by you, Neagley and Dixon
visited New Age,

36:27.352 --> 36:28.562
where the director of operations

36:28.562 --> 36:30.355
gave them the name
and address of the person

36:30.355 --> 36:32.441
the pass was issued to.

36:32.441 --> 36:34.276
An assassin left his address?

36:34.276 --> 36:35.694
We had
the same question.

36:35.694 --> 36:37.321
But it led to two possibilities.

36:37.321 --> 36:40.032
The hit man could've gone
to New Age to canvass a target

36:40.032 --> 36:42.159
in which case the address
he gave would be fake.

36:42.159 --> 36:45.662
Or he could've gone to New Age
'cause he was working for them--

36:45.662 --> 36:48.582
a hit man for hire getting
an assignment to track us down--

36:48.582 --> 36:51.084
in which case, getting a real
address from them means

36:51.084 --> 36:52.544
someone wanted us
to check it out.

36:52.544 --> 36:55.672
So, you four guys just
decided to walk into a place

36:55.672 --> 36:57.716
where you knew people
were waiting to kill you?

36:57.716 --> 37:00.260
Well, in our defense,
we did blow it up first.

37:00.260 --> 37:02.054
Un-fucking-believable.

37:02.054 --> 37:04.306
We got confirmation
this all goes through New Age.

37:05.432 --> 37:07.726
Found that on one of them.

37:07.726 --> 37:09.811
So, you get this
from the guy you shot,

37:09.811 --> 37:12.981
blew up, or the asshole
who died by barbecue?

37:12.981 --> 37:14.900
He was stopped by the barbecue.

37:14.900 --> 37:16.860
He died from trans fats.

37:17.778 --> 37:19.029
Where's his car?

37:19.029 --> 37:20.781
We decided to take it
with us last minute.

37:20.781 --> 37:22.658
Plates swapped, parked out back,

37:22.658 --> 37:24.660
head-in to hide
as much damage as possible.

37:24.660 --> 37:26.203
You never know when you
could use another vehicle.

37:26.203 --> 37:29.414
Look, if we're gonna
help each other,

37:29.414 --> 37:32.084
I got to know that you guys
are not gonna go rogue.

37:32.084 --> 37:34.211
Especially now that
we got a setback.

37:34.211 --> 37:35.295
What setback?

37:35.295 --> 37:37.089
A.M. never showed up
at the airport.

37:37.089 --> 37:39.091
So he knows
he's being watched.

37:39.091 --> 37:42.010
That list of aliases we gave you
is useless to us now.

37:42.010 --> 37:43.261
Useless to him, too.

37:43.261 --> 37:45.722
But there's no way his plan,
whatever it is,

37:45.722 --> 37:47.140
isn't still in motion.

37:47.140 --> 37:48.517
After what we did tonight,

37:48.517 --> 37:50.102
it's gonna be tough
for us to work the case

37:50.102 --> 37:52.145
- if the cops get onto us.
- They're not.

37:52.145 --> 37:53.730
Once I heard
the description of the perp,

37:53.730 --> 37:55.315
I raced down there

37:55.315 --> 37:57.359
and I got an official statement
from Mrs. Gottelsman.

37:57.359 --> 38:01.279
Let's just say
I didn't get, uh...

38:01.279 --> 38:03.699
all your dimensions
correct in my report.

38:05.951 --> 38:09.121
I don't like doing that.

38:09.121 --> 38:12.666
Do not put me in
that position ever again.

38:12.666 --> 38:15.502
In the meantime, I can use this
to support a warrant on New Age.

38:15.502 --> 38:17.295
That's the logical next step.

38:17.295 --> 38:19.798
Well, glad we're finally
in agreement on something.

38:19.798 --> 38:22.217
In the meantime,
I need you guys to stay

38:22.217 --> 38:25.262
the fuck put
until you hear from me.

38:25.262 --> 38:26.972
Then let me give you a number
so you don't have to come around

38:26.972 --> 38:30.058
where you're not wanted
every time you need to talk.

38:30.058 --> 38:31.518
Burner?

38:31.518 --> 38:33.145
I thought you didn't
have a phone.

38:33.145 --> 38:34.354
It's not mine.

38:34.354 --> 38:36.106
Belonged to someone I killed.

38:42.654 --> 38:43.864
Okay.

38:46.199 --> 38:48.493
I'm serious...

38:48.493 --> 38:51.079
no more fucking cowboy shit.

39:01.715 --> 39:04.342
So... what are we
gonna do now, boss?

39:04.342 --> 39:06.386
Saddle up,

39:06.386 --> 39:09.973
'cause we're about to do
a whole lot of cowboy shit.

39:09.973 --> 39:12.059

39:30.744 --> 39:32.954
Closest police station

39:45.258 --> 39:46.718
don't wait for me.

Hooah, Major.

41:22.814 --> 41:25.025
- You see Reacher?
- Nope.

41:25.025 --> 41:26.484
But he said not to wait for him.

41:26.484 --> 41:28.028
Shit.

41:28.028 --> 41:29.029
We got to go.

41:29.029 --> 41:30.238
No, I'm not leaving him here.

41:30.238 --> 41:31.448
I don't want to go either,

41:31.448 --> 41:32.949

from Jack Reacher.

41:32.949 --> 41:35.118

41:35.118 --> 41:36.453
Fuck.

41:40.832 --> 41:41.791
Hey!

41:42.834 --> 41:44.002
Stop!

41:54.638 --> 41:56.431
I can't believe
you were gonna leave me.

41:58.391 --> 41:59.976
Asshole.

42:15.116 --> 42:16.284

42:16.284 --> 42:17.619
Torch.

42:20.205 --> 42:21.623
Find something?

42:25.543 --> 42:27.629
No fucking way.

42:28.922 --> 42:31.174
Holy shit,
it's Swan.

42:31.174 --> 42:33.635
He was working at New Age

42:33.635 --> 42:35.762
with the people who have
been trying to kill us.
