00:12.440 --> 00:14.050
<b>Where is our friend?</b>

00:14.050 --> 00:16.240
<b>Machi and Nobunaga are tailing him.</b>

00:16.700 --> 00:18.000
<b>He's just up ahead.</b>

00:19.370 --> 00:22.250
<b>We'll let you negotiate with the exorcist.</b>

00:22.710 --> 00:24.250
<b>We're willing to pay any price he asks.</b>

00:24.250 --> 00:27.000
<b>Anyway, just make sure he agrees to do it.</b>

00:27.530 --> 00:29.100
<b>I understand.</b>

00:30.520 --> 00:33.360
<b>After all, I won't get to fight Chrollo otherwise...</b>

01:55.010 --> 02:00.050
<b>Chase x And x Chance</b>

02:02.770 --> 02:04.060
<b>That's him.</b>

02:04.680 --> 02:06.230
<b>How did you find him?</b>

02:06.960 --> 02:08.920
<b>Hell if I'll tell you, fool.</b>

02:11.050 --> 02:12.820
<b>You in the shadows,</b>

02:13.890 --> 02:15.820
<b>was it through your power?</b>

02:16.770 --> 02:18.680
<b>You didn't even use <i>En</i>.</b>

02:18.680 --> 02:20.160
<b>Are you some kind of freak?</b>

02:21.660 --> 02:24.760
<b>I recently completed a very entertaining battle.</b>

02:25.290 --> 02:28.450
<b>I'm quite sensitive at the moment...</b>

02:28.950 --> 02:31.080
<b>To calm myself down,</b>

02:31.080 --> 02:35.840
<b>I rather feel like messing up 
a complete stranger.</b>

02:36.170 --> 02:37.090
<b>Damn.</b>

02:37.090 --> 02:37.950
<b>Come on out.</b>

02:40.050 --> 02:42.300
<b>Was my <i>Zetsu</i> not good enough?</b>

02:43.690 --> 02:45.570
<b>No, it was perfect.</b>

02:45.570 --> 02:47.980
<b>This guy is just insanely perceptive.</b>

02:48.850 --> 02:50.820
<b>Here is Troupe member #4.</b>

02:50.820 --> 02:52.490
<b>In other words, your replacement.</b>

02:52.910 --> 02:54.420
<b>My name is Kalluto.</b>

02:54.420 --> 02:58.820
<b>I cannot tell you how my power works, 
but we found him by using it.</b>

02:59.210 --> 03:00.200
<b>Ah...</b>

03:01.360 --> 03:03.370
<b>You look very appetizing as well.</b>

03:03.800 --> 03:05.030
<b>Be careful.</b>

03:05.030 --> 03:06.870
<b>He certainly isn't picky.</b>

03:07.180 --> 03:09.870
<b>Hisoka, you'd better succeed.</b>

03:10.710 --> 03:12.580
<b>You people are so tedious.</b>

03:12.580 --> 03:15.380
<b>I certainly shall, for my own benefit.</b>

03:16.000 --> 03:17.990
<b>Are you serious about fighting the boss?</b>

03:17.990 --> 03:19.150
<b>Of course I am.</b>

03:19.150 --> 03:22.870
<b>Would you prefer that I survive, 
or that Chrollo survives?</b>

03:22.870 --> 03:23.910
<b>A stupid question.</b>

03:23.910 --> 03:26.890
<b>Once you finish your job here, 
you can die, for all I care.</b>

03:27.470 --> 03:29.890
<b>And if I kill Chrollo, then what?</b>

03:30.210 --> 03:31.590
<b>That would be impossible.</b>

03:31.590 --> 03:33.150
<b>But I'll answer your question.</b>

03:33.500 --> 03:36.650
<b>I would pursue you to the ends 
of the Earth to kill you.</b>

03:39.290 --> 03:40.990
<b>I like the sound of that...</b>

03:43.960 --> 03:45.960
<b>Our objective is</b>

03:45.960 --> 03:49.580
<b>to obtain Breath of Archangel, 
currently monopolized by Team Genthru.</b>

03:49.900 --> 03:54.390
<b>We must force them to transform a card,</b>

03:54.390 --> 03:56.820
<b>or we won't have a chance to use our Voucher.</b>

03:56.820 --> 03:59.520
<b>And that's where Team Gon comes in.</b>

04:00.660 --> 04:03.090
<b>While they may not have the 
strength to win outright,</b>

04:03.500 --> 04:07.600
<b>they are highly likely to deal serious 
damage to a member of Team Genthru.</b>

04:08.520 --> 04:11.100
<b>If they're forced to use a Breath of Archangel,</b>

04:11.520 --> 04:14.850
<b>Voucher

A voucher that can be 
exchanged for Breath 
of Archangel. Can only 
be obtained when 
Breath of Archangel 
has attained its card 
transformation limit.</b>

04:11.960 --> 04:15.090
<b>our Voucher will become a Breath of Archangel.</b>

04:15.020 --> 04:17.110
<b>Breath of Archangel 

An angel that cures any 
mortal injury or terminal 
illness with one breath. 
But angel only appears once.</b>

04:16.040 --> 04:17.110
<b>After that...</b>

04:17.390 --> 04:20.050
<b>We only need Lucky Alexandrite!</b>

04:20.050 --> 04:23.070
<b>And if we can buy three weeks for those kids,</b>

04:23.070 --> 04:24.860
<b>they'll trade the card to us!</b>

04:25.200 --> 04:25.890
<b>Yes.</b>

04:26.440 --> 04:28.000
<b>Right, it's time.</b>

04:28.000 --> 04:29.150
<b>Let's get going.</b>

04:34.940 --> 04:38.130
<b>Cards Needed

Patch of Shore
Lucky Alexandrite</b>

04:35.470 --> 04:38.130
<b>I believe I told you to come alone.</b>

04:38.540 --> 04:40.880
<b>We weren't able to make a decision,</b>

04:39.040 --> 04:43.130
<b>Cards Needed

Breath of Archangel
Lucky Alexandrite
Blue Planet</b>

04:40.880 --> 04:43.130
<b>so we kept discussing it on our way here.</b>

04:43.590 --> 04:46.050
<b>And we've finally reached a consensus.</b>

04:49.020 --> 04:49.890
<b>We choose to fight!</b>

04:52.890 --> 04:53.890
<b><i>Levy on!</i></b>

04:54.490 --> 04:55.730
<b><i>Accompany on!</i></b>

04:55.730 --> 04:56.660
<b>To Antokiba!</b>

04:58.920 --> 04:59.560
<b><i>Book.</i></b>

05:00.650 --> 05:01.820
<b>Check your cards.</b>

05:02.290 --> 05:03.000
<b><i>Book!</i></b>

05:05.100 --> 05:06.090
<b>It's okay.</b>

05:06.320 --> 05:08.530
<b>They only stole some useless 
cards from my free slots.</b>

05:08.860 --> 05:10.370
<b>Same here.</b>

05:10.370 --> 05:12.010
<b>I didn't lose anything important.</b>

05:12.010 --> 05:13.620
<b>Guess that settles it.</b>

05:13.620 --> 05:15.240
<b>We take their cards and kill them.</b>

05:15.240 --> 05:16.410
<b>They'll put up a fight.</b>

05:16.410 --> 05:16.920
<b>Huh?</b>

05:17.690 --> 05:19.930
<b>I don't know what's happened to them...</b>

05:20.870 --> 05:23.580
<b>But their resolve was written all over their faces.</b>

05:24.780 --> 05:26.250
<b>Six copies of Accompany,</b>

05:26.250 --> 05:27.840
<b>twenty-four of Return,</b>

05:27.840 --> 05:29.430
<b>nine copies of Castle Gate,</b>

05:29.430 --> 05:31.350
<b>and two of Magnetic Force.</b>

05:32.160 --> 05:34.180
<b>I spent all our money on them.</b>

05:34.470 --> 05:36.820
<b>Okay, then we'll meet up in three days.</b>

05:36.820 --> 05:40.190
<b>Use that time to earn money 
and buy the cards we need.</b>

05:40.450 --> 05:41.480
<b>Got it.</b>

05:43.790 --> 05:45.990
<b>Do you think they'll come after us?</b>

05:45.990 --> 05:47.630
<b>Not immediately.</b>

05:47.630 --> 05:51.700
<b>We now have nearly twice the number 
of Accompany cards as Genthru.</b>

05:52.010 --> 05:55.950
<b>If they use Clairvoyant Serpent, they'll see that.</b>

05:56.940 --> 05:58.910
<b><i>Just you watch, Genthru...</i></b>

05:59.400 --> 06:02.040
<b><i>This is how a Single Star Hunter fights.</i></b>

06:02.460 --> 06:04.920
<b>A Few Days Later</b>

06:10.310 --> 06:10.890
<b><i>Gyo!</i></b>

06:11.710 --> 06:12.680
<b>Too slow!</b>

06:12.680 --> 06:15.250
<b>Don't stop to think after I grab your arm.</b>

06:15.250 --> 06:17.290
<b>Act the second you feel my touch!</b>

06:17.290 --> 06:17.890
<b>Osu!</b>

06:20.430 --> 06:21.310
<b>Too slow.</b>

06:21.310 --> 06:22.000
<b>Osu!</b>

06:23.170 --> 06:24.430
<b>You're still too slow!</b>

06:24.430 --> 06:24.940
<b>Osu!</b>

06:25.870 --> 06:27.630
<b>Okay, let's take a ten-minute break.</b>

06:27.630 --> 06:29.420
<b>Next, we'll start Emitter training.</b>

06:29.420 --> 06:29.950
<b>Osu.</b>

06:32.450 --> 06:34.700
<b><i>He's building his stamina...</i></b>

06:35.100 --> 06:37.180
<b><i>But in the mere two weeks we have left,</i></b>

06:37.180 --> 06:39.540
<b><i>I can only help him bolster his defense.</i></b>

06:39.840 --> 06:42.960
<b><i>We need another weapon before we can fight.</i></b>

06:44.890 --> 06:46.670
<b>Emitter training, level two.</b>

06:46.670 --> 06:47.670
<b>Elevation!</b>

06:47.670 --> 06:50.550
<b>You must maintain this stance, 
while staying perfectly still,</b>

06:50.550 --> 06:51.970
<b>and only by releasing aura.</b>

07:02.490 --> 07:06.570
<b>If you can elevate around 
at least that high, you pass.</b>

07:07.220 --> 07:08.570
<b>Okay!</b>

07:29.340 --> 07:32.070
<b>That training is a lot harder,</b>

07:32.070 --> 07:33.840
<b>given that it's only a level higher.</b>

07:34.270 --> 07:37.900
<b>Naturally... Because this is 
really level-five training.</b>

07:37.900 --> 07:38.750
<b>Five?</b>

07:38.750 --> 07:41.130
<b>Are you sure you should skip levels like that?</b>

07:41.130 --> 07:42.810
<b>Well, it's a gamble.</b>

07:42.810 --> 07:45.860
<b>If it doesn't work, we'll have wasted 
the three weeks we were given.</b>

07:46.420 --> 07:49.970
<b>If we followed the proper sequence, 
he could reach level three easily.</b>

07:49.970 --> 07:53.110
<b>But that wouldn't do him any 
good in actual combat.</b>

07:53.660 --> 07:57.620
<b>He needs an Emitter attack that 
can push an opponent back</b>

07:57.620 --> 07:59.120
<b>several meters with a direct hit.</b>

07:59.600 --> 08:03.590
<b>It must be that strong for 
him to use it as a weapon.</b>

08:03.590 --> 08:05.460
<b>So you jumped to level five...</b>

08:05.460 --> 08:08.420
<b>But even if he clears the training,</b>

08:08.420 --> 08:11.480
<b>the ability to send enemies flying 
isn't a desicively lethal weapon.</b>

08:11.960 --> 08:13.230
<b>Exactly right.</b>

08:13.230 --> 08:17.510
<b>It's only meant to give him more options.</b>

08:18.680 --> 08:20.890
<b>So have you made any progress on a plan?</b>

08:21.540 --> 08:24.390
<b>First, can you tell me what your power is?</b>

08:24.390 --> 08:26.650
<b>My job will be easier with that information.</b>

08:32.110 --> 08:34.390
<b>I'll introduce you to my power.</b>

08:34.960 --> 08:37.410
<b>Magical Esthetician Cookie-chan.</b>

08:37.830 --> 08:40.840
<b>She specializes in providing 
massages of pure pleasure.</b>

08:41.210 --> 08:45.250
<b>She'll burn off excess fat and guide both 
your body and your soul to paradise.</b>

08:46.300 --> 08:49.590
<b>When her aura, transformed into 
special lotion, is applied to the skin,</b>

08:49.590 --> 08:51.420
<b>it makes your skin look younger.</b>

08:52.310 --> 08:55.380
<b>She can also use acupressure massage 
to cleanse your body internally.</b>

08:55.760 --> 08:59.540
<b>Constipation, stiff shoulders, chills... 
any anomaly you have will vanish!</b>

09:02.240 --> 09:03.430
<b>That's it?</b>

09:03.680 --> 09:05.110
<b>Of course not!</b>

09:05.110 --> 09:08.760
<b>She can also do chiropractic massages, 
meditative massages, rolling massages...</b>

09:08.760 --> 09:10.440
<b>And there's still much more!</b>

09:11.450 --> 09:12.970
<b>Are you an idiot?!</b>

09:12.970 --> 09:14.890
<b>That's totally worthless!</b>

09:14.890 --> 09:16.250
<b>What are you talking about?!</b>

09:16.250 --> 09:18.780
<b>That's the most useful power in the world!</b>

09:19.350 --> 09:22.090
<b>This is why you're just a stupid old hag!</b>

09:22.090 --> 09:23.770
<b>I dare you to say that again!</b>

09:34.310 --> 09:35.370
<b><i>Return on!</i></b>

09:35.370 --> 09:36.300
<b>To Soufrabi!</b>

09:36.860 --> 09:38.050
<b>Wait up!</b>

09:38.470 --> 09:39.690
<b>Was it them again?</b>

09:39.690 --> 09:42.940
<b>Damn, they're getting pretty blatant...</b>

09:43.440 --> 09:46.000
<b>They're definitely targeting us!</b>

09:46.000 --> 09:47.480
<b>That isn't the issue.</b>

09:47.890 --> 09:51.040
<b>How do they know where to find us?</b>

09:51.040 --> 09:55.150
<b>If they were using Accompany or Magnetic 
Force to move straight to us, we'd know,</b>

09:55.150 --> 09:56.390
<b>but that isn't the case.</b>

09:56.900 --> 10:00.390
<b>They're using hit and run tactics, 
then making clean escapes.</b>

10:00.750 --> 10:04.870
<b>We immediately move to a different location, 
but before long, they find us.</b>

10:05.320 --> 10:07.080
<b>They're using <i>Nen</i>.</b>

10:07.330 --> 10:11.310
<b>If they aren't using a spell, 
like homing or tracking,</b>

10:11.310 --> 10:16.090
<b>one of their members must have 
a <i>Nen</i> power similar to radar.</b>

10:16.870 --> 10:18.860
<b>We can't defend against that!</b>

10:18.860 --> 10:19.840
<b>What do we do?</b>

10:22.010 --> 10:24.850
<b>We'll just have to use some force.</b>

10:29.620 --> 10:31.800
<b>That's one copy of Accompany...</b>

10:31.800 --> 10:34.730
<b>Take all his C-rank cards.</b>

10:36.390 --> 10:40.920
<b>Okay, we'll set Steal on his binder...</b>

10:42.080 --> 10:43.490
<b>He hasn't met them before.</b>

10:43.490 --> 10:45.180
<b>Then he's clean.</b>

10:48.970 --> 10:51.440
<b>Hey, have you heard of the bombers?</b>

10:51.740 --> 10:54.250
<b>Yes, I've heard the rumors...</b>

10:54.630 --> 10:56.350
<b>We are the bombers.</b>

10:58.650 --> 11:00.830
<b>I just set a bomb on you.</b>

11:01.280 --> 11:04.230
<b>I can kill you from anywhere, anytime I wish.</b>

11:05.320 --> 11:09.140
<b>If you don't want to die, 
bring me the cards I request.</b>

11:15.160 --> 11:18.010
<b>Hey, here's another Accompany!</b>

11:18.010 --> 11:20.650
<b>I'll set Steal in here....</b>

11:22.160 --> 11:23.280
<b>Kess

<b><i>What are those bastards thinking?!</i></b>

11:48.770 --> 11:51.640
<b>They're camping outside the spell card store.</b>

11:52.100 --> 11:56.670
<b>And they're attacking every player who 
walks out with newly bought cards.</b>

11:57.870 --> 11:59.690
<b>This is pure speculation.</b>

12:00.020 --> 12:02.450
<b>But they must be aware of me.</b>

12:03.140 --> 12:07.240
<b>They've realized that someone new is 
providing cards to Team Tsezgerra.</b>

12:07.920 --> 12:10.300
<b>So to flush me out,</b>

12:10.300 --> 12:13.450
<b>they check the binders of

12:13.450 --> 12:17.550
<b>disposing of everyone who's met one of you.</b>

12:18.480 --> 12:20.760
<b>They also steal their cards.</b>

12:20.760 --> 12:24.090
<b>They're primarily focused on obtaining 
Accompany and Magnetic Force.</b>

12:24.610 --> 12:27.260
<b>And any players that they free 
once cleared of suspicion</b>

12:27.260 --> 12:30.100
<b>are forced to collect cards for them.</b>

12:30.530 --> 12:33.160
<b>By eliminating suspects and taking their cards,</b>

12:33.160 --> 12:35.930
<b>they also cut off our supply.</b>

12:35.930 --> 12:37.950
<b>They're killing three birds with one stone.</b>

12:38.760 --> 12:39.930
<b>Got it.</b>

12:39.930 --> 12:42.730
<b>We'll try to track their movements.</b>

12:42.730 --> 12:45.730
<b>Get away from there and

<b>Silent Worker: Fly on the Job</b>

12:58.120 --> 13:00.430
<b>They don't appear to be leaving Masadora.</b>

13:00.830 --> 13:03.510
<b>Okay, next we check their cards.</b>

13:05.340 --> 13:07.450
<b>Together, those three have</b>

13:07.450 --> 13:10.930
<b>sixteen copies of Accompany 
and two of Magnetic Force.</b>

13:10.930 --> 13:12.320
<b>That's a significant increase...</b>

13:12.750 --> 13:16.550
<b>At this pace, they'll catch up 
to us in four to five days.</b>

13:16.880 --> 13:19.140
<b>But we expected that.</b>

13:19.740 --> 13:24.030
<b>They're saying they won't move 
until they have enough cards.</b>

13:24.740 --> 13:25.920
<b>Everything is going well.</b>

13:26.310 --> 13:28.200
<b>Twelve days left.</b>

13:38.720 --> 13:40.170
<b>It's not working...</b>

13:42.870 --> 13:44.070
<b><i>Listen to me.</i></b>

13:44.070 --> 13:46.180
<b><i>While training, see yourself firing a water pistol.</i></b>

13:47.020 --> 13:50.290
<b><i>You build up aura within your body, 
then shoot it from your palm!</i></b>

13:50.890 --> 13:56.190
<b><i>The greater your power, 
the stronger the aura you fire.</i></b>

13:56.860 --> 13:59.880
<b><i>You want to release all the aura 
you've kept closed up inside.</i></b>

14:00.140 --> 14:02.600
<b><i>The total amount of refined 
aura you apply to the attack,</i></b>

14:02.600 --> 14:05.940
<b><i>and the speed, power, and timing 
you apply to the release...</i></b>

14:06.680 --> 14:11.080
<b><i>You need all of those elements 
to land the attack you'll require.</i></b>

14:12.760 --> 14:14.260
<b>It's too hard!</b>

14:14.260 --> 14:18.910
<b>I just don't get how you push the aura 
in your body out of your hand...</b>

14:19.790 --> 14:22.590
<b>He hasn't made any progress for ten days.</b>

14:23.200 --> 14:26.530
<b>Maybe you should have let 
him start from level two.</b>

14:26.870 --> 14:28.490
<b>We still have ten more days...</b>

14:28.880 --> 14:30.980
<b>Only if Tsezgerra can deliver.</b>

14:31.840 --> 14:35.300
<b>In hindsight, it wasn't a very good deal.</b>

14:35.750 --> 14:37.960
<b>If we give Team Tsezgerra Lucky Alexandrite,</b>

14:37.960 --> 14:39.800
<b>they'll only be missing two cards.</b>

14:40.210 --> 14:43.040
<b>We still need over thirty...</b>

14:43.450 --> 14:47.110
<b>We can just take them from Genthru by force.</b>

14:47.390 --> 14:49.730
<b>Gon would never accept that...</b>

14:49.730 --> 14:53.120
<b>And we still have to figure out 
how to defeat Genthru first.</b>

14:53.120 --> 14:54.710
<b>That's true.</b>

14:56.480 --> 14:58.870
<b>So is this big enough?</b>

14:59.620 --> 15:00.420
<b>Yeah.</b>

15:01.880 --> 15:04.370
<b>A Few Days Later</b>

15:05.280 --> 15:08.380
<b>We now have forty-eight copies of Accompany.</b>

15:08.970 --> 15:10.940
<b>If you total their Accompany, Return,</b>

15:10.940 --> 15:14.310
<b>and Magnetic Force cards, 
they only have forty-five cards.</b>

15:15.050 --> 15:16.720
<b>Now they can't evade us.</b>

15:18.120 --> 15:21.820
<b>Let us start a game of tag we cannot lose.</b>

15:23.240 --> 15:24.620
<b><i>Accompany on!</i></b>

15:24.620 --> 15:25.650
<b>Tsezgerra!</b>

15:27.420 --> 15:28.390
<b>They're on the move!</b>

15:28.390 --> 15:30.400
<b>They're coming our way at an incredible speed!</b>

15:32.380 --> 15:33.660
<b>We move according to the plan!</b>

15:42.370 --> 15:43.820
<b><i>Accompany on!</i></b>

15:43.820 --> 15:44.540
<b>To Masadora!</b>

15:46.710 --> 15:48.100
<b><i>Accompany on!</i></b>

15:48.100 --> 15:48.800
<b>Tsezgerra!</b>

15:55.690 --> 15:56.970
<b><i>Accompany on!</i></b>

15:56.970 --> 15:57.810
<b>To Soufrabi!</b>

15:58.670 --> 15:59.990
<b><i>Accompany on!</i></b>

15:59.990 --> 16:00.640
<b>Tsezgerra!</b>

16:05.110 --> 16:06.240
<b><i>Accompany on!</i></b>

16:06.240 --> 16:07.020
<b>To Masadora!</b>

16:07.310 --> 16:08.370
<b><i>Accompany on!</i></b>

16:08.370 --> 16:08.900
<b>Tsezgerra!</b>

16:20.180 --> 16:21.300
<b>I'm out now.</b>

16:21.300 --> 16:22.140
<b>Barry!</b>

16:22.140 --> 16:22.870
<b>Roger that.</b>

16:23.390 --> 16:24.750
<b><i>Accompany on!</i></b>

16:24.750 --> 16:25.910
<b>To Soufrabi!</b>

16:29.770 --> 16:32.850
<b><i>Damn, we only have five days left...</i></b>

16:33.370 --> 16:36.390
<b>Don't you have any advice that 
could help him break through?</b>

16:36.750 --> 16:39.690
<b>The sensation of aura flowing through the body</b>

16:39.690 --> 16:41.890
<b>is different for everyone.</b>

16:42.460 --> 16:46.110
<b>If I give him advice from my own perception 
and he makes incorrect assumptions,</b>

16:46.110 --> 16:48.850
<b>it could end up hurting more than helping.</b>

16:55.670 --> 16:57.080
<b>How many do we have left?</b>

16:57.080 --> 16:58.860
<b>Seven copies of Accompany.</b>

16:59.380 --> 17:00.570
<b>They aren't coming...</b>

17:00.570 --> 17:01.560
<b>Did they give up?</b>

17:02.220 --> 17:03.310
<b>No way.</b>

17:03.650 --> 17:06.060
<b>They're taking their time to throw us off.</b>

17:06.060 --> 17:08.530
<b>If we run out of Accompany, 
we'll have to use Return.</b>

17:08.530 --> 17:09.600
<b>Understood.</b>

17:09.600 --> 17:11.930
<b>We'll alternate between Aiai and Soufrabi.</b>

17:11.930 --> 17:12.920
<b>How's it going over there?</b>

17:13.430 --> 17:14.320
<b>Let's find out.</b>

17:15.240 --> 17:16.640
<b><i>Contact on.</i></b>

17:16.640 --> 17:17.180
<b>Goreinu.</b>

17:18.520 --> 17:19.290
<b>This is Tsezgerra.</b>

17:19.720 --> 17:20.960
<b>How's it going there?</b>

17:21.300 --> 17:23.180
<b>You were right.</b>

17:23.520 --> 17:25.530
<b>Sub and Bara have appeared.</b>

17:25.530 --> 17:27.190
<b>Most likely the real ones.</b>

17:27.950 --> 17:32.440
<b>They're speculating that I'll try to buy 
cards while they're playing tag.</b>

17:33.040 --> 17:37.420
<b>Which means it's Genthru and a couple 
of fakes that are chasing you.</b>

17:37.420 --> 17:39.780
<b>Then Tsezgerra's predictions were accurate!</b>

17:40.130 --> 17:41.830
<b>The same trick won't work again.</b>

17:42.280 --> 17:46.580
<b>Right now, Genthru is alone, 
while there are four of us.</b>

17:46.580 --> 17:47.460
<b>This is our chance!</b>

17:47.990 --> 17:51.710
<b>No, I would prefer better odds for a fight.</b>

17:52.130 --> 17:53.860
<b>We'll stick to the original plan.</b>

17:57.260 --> 17:58.290
<b>Here they come.</b>

17:58.290 --> 17:59.760
<b>We're back on the run!</b>

18:04.280 --> 18:04.930
<b>Gon...</b>

18:05.740 --> 18:06.690
<b>Time's up.</b>

18:07.170 --> 18:08.480
<b>Your training's over.</b>

18:08.850 --> 18:10.480
<b>We still have five days!</b>

18:10.480 --> 18:12.060
<b>Change in plans.</b>

18:12.060 --> 18:14.400
<b>I came up with a plan for defeating them.</b>

18:14.400 --> 18:16.110
<b>But... But...</b>

18:16.390 --> 18:18.280
<b>Uh, well...</b>

18:18.280 --> 18:20.210
<b>I think I've almost got it.</b>

18:20.530 --> 18:21.200
<b>Maybe...</b>

18:21.200 --> 18:22.420
<b>No, it isn't happening.</b>

18:22.420 --> 18:26.120
<b>And I can't use an unreliable 
technique in my plan...</b>

18:26.640 --> 18:27.430
<b>Give up.</b>

18:28.350 --> 18:30.590
<b>So the plan is...</b>

18:30.590 --> 18:31.880
<b>To use this.</b>

18:32.430 --> 18:33.150
<b>Huh?</b>

18:33.970 --> 18:35.800
<b>You'll have to learn this the hard way.</b>

18:35.800 --> 18:38.030
<b>Until you get it down to perfection.</b>

18:41.720 --> 18:43.680
<b>We're out of Accompany cards...</b>

18:43.680 --> 18:44.930
<b>Use Return!</b>

18:48.070 --> 18:49.450
<b><i>Return on!</i></b>

18:49.450 --> 18:50.460
<b>To Aiai!</b>

18:53.110 --> 18:55.400
<b>They're out of Accompany cards?</b>

18:55.400 --> 18:57.270
<b>We're finally getting close.</b>

18:58.310 --> 18:59.350
<b>Sub, Bara...</b>

18:59.770 --> 19:01.230
<b>How's it going? Catch anyone?</b>

19:01.690 --> 19:05.620
<b>Only one, and it was someone new to the game.</b>

19:06.420 --> 19:08.870
<b>Word's out that the bombers are hunting</b>

19:08.870 --> 19:11.130
<b>players around here, so everyone's staying away.</b>

19:12.080 --> 19:16.130
<b>Could he have been someone 
we already disposed of?</b>

19:17.100 --> 19:18.400
<b>Perhaps...</b>

19:18.400 --> 19:20.240
<b>Okay, come back.</b>

19:20.620 --> 19:22.030
<b>I'm in Soufrabi now.</b>

19:24.440 --> 19:26.990
<b>They're out of bullets.</b>

19:31.020 --> 19:33.770
<b>Leave 

Send one target player 
off the island. 

[SR][NORM]</b>

19:31.700 --> 19:33.770
<b>We're finally down to our last card.</b>

19:34.210 --> 19:38.450
<b>If they follow us outside the game, 
we can fend them off at the mansion.</b>

19:38.450 --> 19:41.530
<b>If they don't follow us, we just have 
to wait until the time limit is up.</b>

19:41.950 --> 19:43.530
<b>It's perfect...</b>

19:43.530 --> 19:46.150
<b>All that's left is choosing the 
three to keep for winning.</b>

19:46.150 --> 19:49.540
<b>We just have to ask Mr. Battera what he wants.</b>

19:52.120 --> 19:53.540
<b>Okay, let's go!</b>

19:54.200 --> 19:55.200
<b><i>Leave!</i></b>

20:11.680 --> 20:13.030
<b>No one's here.</b>

20:13.030 --> 20:14.190
<b>What's going on?</b>

20:14.520 --> 20:16.690
<b>Weren't armed guards standing by?</b>

20:17.230 --> 20:19.020
<b>Sabazushi, where are you?</b>

20:19.020 --> 20:20.440
<b>Answer if you're there!</b>

20:20.870 --> 20:21.980
<b>Sabazushi!</b>

20:22.570 --> 20:24.450
<b>Keep it down...</b>

20:24.760 --> 20:27.450
<b>I was taking a nap.</b>

20:27.450 --> 20:28.870
<b>A nap?</b>

20:29.330 --> 20:30.980
<b>What happened to everyone else?</b>

20:30.980 --> 20:32.260
<b>They left.</b>

20:32.970 --> 20:35.540
<b>Mr. Battera canceled the whole thing.</b>

20:35.540 --> 20:38.240
<b>We received an intermediary fee 
and a cancellation fee.</b>

20:38.240 --> 20:41.650
<b>But I stayed behind because I 
thought I should inform you.</b>

20:42.760 --> 20:44.060
<b>Canceled?</b>

20:46.000 --> 20:47.010
<b>Mr. Battera!</b>

20:47.370 --> 20:49.350
<b>What is the meaning of this?!</b>

20:49.350 --> 20:51.180
<b>We're so close!</b>

20:51.180 --> 20:53.020
<b>We're close to beating the game!</b>

20:53.910 --> 20:55.210
<b>It doesn't matter...</b>

20:55.580 --> 20:56.950
<b>Doesn't matter anymore.</b>

20:57.660 --> 20:58.840
<b>Doesn't matter?!</b>

20:58.840 --> 20:59.680
<b>That's crap!</b>

21:00.040 --> 21:03.030
<b>What about all the time and effort we've spent?</b>

21:03.560 --> 21:06.370
<b>My lawyers have been instructed to pay you.</b>

21:07.070 --> 21:10.620
<b>You can do whatever you want with the cards.</b>

21:11.850 --> 21:13.430
<b>So now,</b>

21:14.470 --> 21:17.250
<b>just leave me alone...</b>

21:19.960 --> 21:21.190
<b>Damn!</b>

21:22.280 --> 21:23.860
<b>What's going on?</b>

21:23.860 --> 21:25.050
<b>I don't know.</b>

21:25.050 --> 21:27.490
<b>Why did this happen?</b>

21:32.360 --> 21:35.380
<b>We're free to kill them out here.</b>

21:35.380 --> 21:37.850
<b>Since their ring data won't disappear.</b>

21:42.100 --> 21:46.790
<b>Team Tsezgerra has given Gon and his 
friends the time that they promised.</b>
