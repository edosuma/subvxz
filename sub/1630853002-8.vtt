11:40.560 --> 11:43.480
 medical and pharmacological
 explanations first.

11:43.560 --> 11:44.680
 Poison.

11:44.760 --> 11:46.280
 Oh, that's a
 distinct possibility.

11:46.360 --> 11:47.960
 How long is this going to take?

11:48.040 --> 11:49.840
 I mean, I don't want
 to be insensitive,

11:49.920 --> 11:51.680
 but we're on a tight schedule.

11:51.760 --> 11:53.280
 Pleasure to meet
 you, Mrs. Gladwell.

11:53.360 --> 11:55.120
 My grandmother is a huge fan.

11:55.200 --> 11:56.640
 That's delightful.

11:56.720 --> 11:58.040
 As I was saying-

11:58.120 --> 12:00.000
 Yeah, it could be
 days, I'm afraid.

12:00.080 --> 12:02.640
 You think it was foul play?

12:04.280 --> 12:08.280
 Did anyone see Mrs. Tibbs
 eat anything before she died?

12:08.360 --> 12:11.280
 We'll need to see the
 footage from today's filming.

12:11.360 --> 12:13.400
 If we can't finish it today,
 we won't have enough time

12:13.480 --> 12:15.840
 to edit it for
 broadcast on Saturday.

12:15.920 --> 12:18.440
 Telephone Jerry, tell him
 one of the contestants

12:18.520 --> 12:19.840
 has popped their clogs

12:19.920 --> 12:23.040
 and we're just going to
 have to remount it live.

12:23.120 --> 12:26.200
 -[camera clicking]
 -Come on.

12:26.280 --> 12:28.240
 Heaven forbid anyone
 should accuse her

12:28.320 --> 12:29.600
 of being insensitive.

12:29.680 --> 12:31.400
 She's our national
 treasure, you know.

12:31.480 --> 12:32.720
 Beloved by millions.

12:32.800 --> 12:35.040
 Your country never
 fails to puzzle me.

12:36.640 --> 12:39.160
 So who might want
 to kill poor Gladys?

12:39.240 --> 12:40.800
 Was there any
 animosity between her

12:40.880 --> 12:42.440
 and the other contestants?

12:42.520 --> 12:44.120
 [light orchestral music]

12:44.200 --> 12:45.480
 Ah.

12:45.560 --> 12:47.000
 And as for you,

12:47.080 --> 12:49.360
 I make sure to give you
 the best cuts of meat

12:49.440 --> 12:51.000
 and this is how I'm repaid.

12:51.080 --> 12:52.360
 I knew it.

12:52.440 --> 12:53.560
 You'll be eating
 nothing but tripe

12:53.640 --> 12:55.240
 for the next six months,

12:55.320 --> 12:57.160
 that's assuming I
 don't evict you both

12:57.240 --> 12:58.360
 -by the end of the day.
 -What?

12:58.440 --> 13:00.160
 You can't do that.

13:00.240 --> 13:02.600
 The tenancy agreement clearly
 states you must give us

13:02.680 --> 13:04.880
 at least one month's
 notice before you can.

13:04.960 --> 13:06.360
 No one is getting evicted.

13:07.960 --> 13:12.080
 Look, Mrs. C, your altercation
 with Gladys was reported

13:12.160 --> 13:14.160
 and we are duty bound
 to follow it up.

13:15.760 --> 13:19.280
 Look, obviously the
 notion that an upstanding,

13:19.360 --> 13:22.480
 churchgoing woman such as
 yourself is responsible is,

13:22.560 --> 13:24.960
 it's unthinkable.

13:25.040 --> 13:27.200
 We're merely trying to
 establish the timeline

13:27.280 --> 13:28.760
 for the hours before her death.

13:28.840 --> 13:31.040
 Can you tell us what
 your argument was about?

13:33.760 --> 13:38.080
 Ghastly woman, a brazen liar
 and a shameless Jezebel.

13:38.160 --> 13:39.880
 Don't write that down.

13:39.960 --> 13:41.960
 I caught her cheating,

13:43.320 --> 13:46.560
 she reentered the tent
 to finish her cake

13:46.640 --> 13:48.920
 and afterwards to
 add insult to injury,

13:49.000 --> 13:53.480
 she had the unmitigated cheek
 to accuse me of sabotage.

13:53.560 --> 13:55.360
 Sabotage?

13:55.440 --> 13:57.720
 It was just before we
 started filming again.

14:00.120 --> 14:02.440
 What have you done to my gateau?

14:02.520 --> 14:04.040
 I beg your pardon?

14:04.120 --> 14:08.160
 The crown and you've
 added extra blackcurrants.

14:08.240 --> 14:10.120
 Nonsense, I haven't touched it.

14:10.200 --> 14:11.560
 [Director] Quiet please.

14:15.360 --> 14:17.240
 I mean, the woman
 was quite deluded.

14:18.960 --> 14:22.840
 I mean, why on earth would
 I put extra blackcurrants

14:22.920 --> 14:24.120
 onto her cake?

14:26.680 --> 14:31.480
 -[melodic orchestral music]

14:33.960 --> 14:36.560
 [flies buzzing]

14:37.680 --> 14:41.000
 [light orchestral music]

14:44.240 --> 14:45.680
 Sister Boniface, will
 you be gracing us

14:45.760 --> 14:48.280
 with your presence
 at, [screaming]!

14:48.360 --> 14:49.160
 Oh, no.

14:49.240 --> 14:50.600
 Colin!

14:50.680 --> 14:52.080
 I'm so sorry, Reverend
 Mother Adrian,

14:52.160 --> 14:54.240
 I found him floating
 dead in the pond.

14:54.320 --> 14:58.040
 And decided to dissect
 him, to desecrate his body?

14:58.120 --> 14:59.880
 Well, I needed to
 find out where the-

14:59.960 --> 15:01.440
 You've gone too far this time,

15:01.520 --> 15:03.280
 your devotion to
 scientific inquiry

15:03.360 --> 15:04.960
 has blinded you to the sacred.

15:06.360 --> 15:08.720
 I insist you hand over
 that fish this minute.

15:08.800 --> 15:10.280
 With respect, Reverend Mother,

15:10.360 --> 15:12.200
 I'm not blind to the
 sanctity of Colin's life,

15:12.280 --> 15:14.000
 I'm trying to find
 out who ended it.

15:14.080 --> 15:15.000
 Who?

15:15.080 --> 15:16.560
 Well, it's just a hypothesis,

15:16.640 --> 15:20.240
 but I believe that whoever
 killed Gladys also killed Colin

15:20.320 --> 15:22.160
 and it's only through
 scientific inquiry,

15:22.240 --> 15:24.680
 that I can help bring
 the killer to justice.

15:24.760 --> 15:27.880
 And afterwards, perhaps,
 well, I've always fancied

15:27.960 --> 15:30.400
 trying my hand at a
 spot of taxidermy, so.

15:30.480 --> 15:32.080
 Don't push your luck, Sister.

15:35.320 --> 15:38.640
 [light orchestral music]

15:42.560 --> 15:44.400
 What is...

15:46.720 --> 15:48.440
 Belladonna, I found
 identical berries

15:48.520 --> 15:50.760
 in what was left
 of Gladys' cake.

15:50.840 --> 15:53.280
 I believe the killer
 contaminated it, a
 few of the berries

15:53.360 --> 15:55.440
 somehow finding their
 way into the pond.

15:55.520 --> 15:57.200
 Poor Colin never had a chance.

15:58.400 --> 16:03.280
 -[water running]
 -[man laughing]

16:08.680 --> 16:10.360
 [water splashing]

16:10.440 --> 16:12.960
 [man laughing]

16:13.920 --> 16:14.760
 Colin?

16:16.320 --> 16:18.560
 Oh yes, Reverend
 Mother's favourite carp.

16:19.560 --> 16:21.200
 Right, well, I'll be sure to add

16:21.280 --> 16:24.000
 Colin's untimely
 death to the charges.

16:24.080 --> 16:26.360
 Mrs. Clam told us the cake
 had been tampered with

16:26.440 --> 16:27.680
 after the break in filming.

16:27.760 --> 16:29.480
 But whoever did it didn't know,

16:29.560 --> 16:31.120
 that Gladys was going to eat it.

16:31.200 --> 16:33.800
 Which leads us to
 a new hypothesis.

16:33.880 --> 16:35.880
 Prunella Gladwell was
 the intended victim.

16:37.160 --> 16:40.040
 [soft orchestral music]

16:40.120 --> 16:42.280
 But as the tide's turning
 on women's rights,

16:42.360 --> 16:45.080
 aren't you afraid that your
 brand of social conservatism

16:45.160 --> 16:46.880
 will turn you into a bit of a,

16:46.960 --> 16:49.040
 well, forgive me for
 saying, but a relic?

16:49.120 --> 16:51.000
 I'm sorry, dear, I
 could barely hear you

16:51.080 --> 16:53.320
 above your agenda
 and quite frankly,

16:53.400 --> 16:55.120
 if traditional values are
 going to become a relic,

16:55.200 --> 16:57.080
 this country is doomed.

16:57.160 --> 16:58.600
 But when those values
 subjugate an entire section-

16:58.680 --> 17:00.440
 Do I look subjugated to you?

17:02.320 --> 17:03.960
 Found the culprit, Inspector?

17:04.040 --> 17:05.760
 Can I talk to you
 in private, please?

17:05.839 --> 17:07.079
 Culprit?

17:07.160 --> 17:08.720
 Peggy told me the cause
 of yesterday's death

17:08.800 --> 17:10.520
 hadn't yet been determined.

17:10.599 --> 17:12.560
 I'll be releasing an official
 statement later today.

17:12.640 --> 17:14.720
 Well, you know I'm not
 interested in official.

17:14.800 --> 17:15.960
 So you know each other?

17:17.480 --> 17:19.960
 Your intrepid reporter
 was just telling me,

17:20.040 --> 17:21.440
 that she believes
 in strong women

17:21.520 --> 17:22.960
 asserting their
 dominance over men.

17:23.040 --> 17:25.280
 -That's not at all what I-
 -Yet here you are

17:25.359 --> 17:28.720
 practically throwing
 yourself at one of them

17:28.800 --> 17:30.040
 -for a story.
 -I'm not throwing at him.

17:30.120 --> 17:31.360
 Our relationship is
 strictly professional.

17:31.440 --> 17:33.280
 -Completely ridiculous.
 -That was easy.

17:33.360 --> 17:34.920
 [light orchestral music]

17:35.000 --> 17:38.320
 Murder in the WI, I have
 to say, I'm not surprised.

17:38.400 --> 17:39.840
 It's a hotbed of intrigue.

17:39.920 --> 17:40.680
 Meaning?

17:45.800 --> 17:47.480
 In private, please?

17:50.680 --> 17:53.760
 Can you think of anyone
 who might want to harm you?

17:53.840 --> 17:55.760
 [Prunella sighing]

17:55.840 --> 17:56.600
 Mrs. Gladwell?

17:56.680 --> 17:57.840
 What's going on?

17:57.920 --> 17:59.520
 Someone's trying to kill me.

18:00.880 --> 18:01.680
 What?

18:04.080 --> 18:05.400
 Who?

18:05.480 --> 18:07.240
 Did you argue with
 anyone yesterday?

18:08.680 --> 18:10.880
 I didn't ruffle any more
 feathers than usual.

18:12.000 --> 18:14.120
 Prunella doesn't suffer fools.

18:16.080 --> 18:18.120
 [Felix clearing throat]

18:18.200 --> 18:19.000
 Ah, one moment.

18:21.720 --> 18:24.320
 The production assistant
 saw three other people

18:24.400 --> 18:26.360
 entering the tent in
 addition to Mrs. Clam,

18:26.440 --> 18:28.280
 Hilary Rhodes and the victim.

18:29.800 --> 18:31.840
 One contestant, Cynthia Piper,

18:31.920 --> 18:34.800
 Prunella's assistant, Azad Verma

18:35.960 --> 18:37.360
 and her husband.

18:37.440 --> 18:38.920
 Yeah?

18:39.000 --> 18:40.880
 -Good work.
 -Something else,

18:40.960 --> 18:44.360
 the cameraman saw Prunella and
 Azad arguing during a break.

18:44.440 --> 18:47.480
 Huh, she didn't mention that.

18:48.760 --> 18:50.920
 Let's go and see
 what Azad has to say.

18:51.920 --> 18:54.200
 [soft orchestral music]

18:54.280 --> 18:55.720
 I mean, you don't even know

18:55.800 --> 18:57.640
 if belladonna grows
 on the convent.

18:57.720 --> 19:00.720
 I mean, the killer could have
 brought it in from outside.

19:00.800 --> 19:03.320
 Well, belladonna's a herbaceous
 perennial, quite common,

19:03.400 --> 19:06.120
 I'd be surprised if it
 didn't turn up somewhere.

19:06.200 --> 19:07.600
 Oh, the leaves!

19:10.560 --> 19:11.360
 Bingo!

19:11.440 --> 19:15.480
 [light orchestral music]

19:15.560 --> 19:18.320
 And look, here's where
 the killer picked them.

19:20.000 --> 19:21.400
 Aye, aye, what's this?

19:23.120 --> 19:26.240
 A clue, [claps hands] I feel
 quite like Sherlock Holmes.

19:26.320 --> 19:30.320
 Bravo, Sisters, your
 assistance has been invaluable,

19:30.400 --> 19:32.160
 but since this is
 now a crime scene,

19:32.240 --> 19:34.040
 if you wouldn't mind just, um...

19:37.400 --> 19:38.160

 Mrs. Gladwell called you

 -"A disgusting deviant."
 -[scouring pad scraping]

 Strong words.

20:27.800 --> 20:30.000
 Your witness must've misheard.

20:30.080 --> 20:31.720
 He seemed very certain.

20:33.880 --> 20:35.760
 She was asking me
 for icing sugar,

20:37.040 --> 20:38.560
 "A dusting
 ingredient," she said.

20:40.000 --> 20:42.280
 Why did she call
 you a deviant, Azad?

20:43.640 --> 20:45.520
 Was it to do with
 your personal life?

20:47.400 --> 20:50.080
 Look, I'm only interested
 in catching a murderer,

20:50.160 --> 20:52.560
 I'm not here to pass judgement .

20:52.640 --> 20:55.240
 [birds chirping]

20:58.680 --> 20:59.880
 She caught me

21:02.680 --> 21:04.240
 with one of the crew members.

21:05.600 --> 21:07.080
 But all of the crew
 members are male.

21:14.120 --> 21:16.000
 She terminated my contract.

21:17.120 --> 21:19.320
 I have until the
 end of the show.

21:19.400 --> 21:22.160
 And then you went
 into the marquee?

21:22.240 --> 21:23.760
 I needed to be alone.

21:23.840 --> 21:25.800
 Was there anyone else
 in there with you?

21:27.120 --> 21:28.560
 No.

21:28.640 --> 21:30.000
 Azad?

21:30.080 --> 21:32.040
 I didn't do anything.

21:32.120 --> 21:35.360
 [soft orchestral music]

21:36.640 --> 21:38.880
 It looks like writing,

21:38.960 --> 21:42.320
 but water and mud
 have made the ink run.

21:42.400 --> 21:43.800
 It'll take me a
 while to dry it out,

21:43.880 --> 21:46.560
 before I can take a
 look under UV light.

21:46.640 --> 21:50.520
 However, far more
 pertinent is this,

21:50.600 --> 21:53.320
 [light orchestral music]

21:53.400 --> 21:55.960
 angora, but the only person,

21:56.040 --> 21:59.120
 that I recall wearing it
 yesterday was Cynthia.

22:01.600 --> 22:03.280
 [Sam] Motive?

22:03.360 --> 22:05.640
 [Sister Boniface]
 Prunella hated her cake.

22:05.720 --> 22:07.280
 Seriously?

22:07.360 --> 22:09.800
 Her criticism was
 particularly brutal.

22:09.880 --> 22:11.320
 But over a cake?

22:12.920 --> 22:16.080
 So she picks up these
 berries in flight of reach,

22:16.160 --> 22:17.840
 an impulse grab?

22:17.920 --> 22:19.280
 [Sam] Over a cake?

22:19.360 --> 22:21.360
 If you'd seen the way
 Prunella devastated her.

22:21.440 --> 22:22.600
 Yeah, I'd like to
 see that footage.

22:22.680 --> 22:23.960
 How are we getting on with that?

22:24.040 --> 22:25.680
 Just done.

22:25.760 --> 22:27.680
 Admittedly, Cynthia didn't
 seem in a murderous rage.

22:27.760 --> 22:29.120
 Well, I'll bring her in,

22:29.200 --> 22:32.280
 I'll see if I can whisk
 her into a frenzy.

22:32.360 --> 22:34.600
 -Or whip her into a rage.
 -[both laughing]

22:34.680 --> 22:36.960
 -Stir her into a confession.
 -Oh.

22:37.040 --> 22:37.960

 I heard she was brutal,
 you must have been angry.

 I was just letting
 off some steam.

23:22.640 --> 23:25.640
 Well, you had every right
 to be angry, Miss Piper.

23:25.720 --> 23:27.320
 The way she humiliated you,

23:27.400 --> 23:29.600
 I would've wanted to
 scratch her eyes out too.

23:31.920 --> 23:34.080
 She's a horrid woman,

23:34.160 --> 23:35.720
 selfish, cruel.

23:36.960 --> 23:38.760
 I'm sorry she
 treated you that way.

 What were you doing
 out in the garden,

24:01.520 --> 24:03.560
 I-I didn't know they were there.

 coming and took off

 to get my makeup.

 was the intended victim.

24:59.160 --> 25:00.880
 Well, that's bigger
 than I thought

25:00.960 --> 25:02.680
 and you think it was
 somebody at the WI?

25:02.760 --> 25:04.920
 What do you know
 about Hilary Rhodes?

25:06.360 --> 25:07.560
 I've heard rumours.

25:08.720 --> 25:10.800
 We had some words, yes.

25:10.880 --> 25:11.760

25:13.440 --> 25:16.720
 I caught her having a go
 at James, belittling him.

25:16.800 --> 25:19.160
 What do you care about how
 she treats her husband?

25:21.160 --> 25:25.120
 James and I were courting,
 when I was in culinary school,

25:25.200 --> 25:27.240
 that's how he met Prunella.

25:27.320 --> 25:29.400
 She stole him from you?

25:29.480 --> 25:32.920
 I let him go, he was never
 really interested in me.

25:33.000 --> 25:36.600
 And yet you saw fit to
 jump to his defence?

25:38.360 --> 25:39.840
 It wasn't just about James,

25:39.920 --> 25:43.240
 she treats everyone as
 though they're her subjects.

25:43.320 --> 25:44.400
 I noticed.

25:45.800 --> 25:48.280
 It must have grated you
 when she came into town,

25:48.360 --> 25:52.760

 your own troubles?

 understand, that's all.

26:09.000 --> 26:10.680
 Your husband abandoned you,

26:10.760 --> 26:14.320
 leaving you with nothing
 but seized assets

26:14.400 --> 26:17.360
 and shortly after, you invite

 something between you and Azad.

 you're getting at.

 your ex-girlfriend,

27:45.960 --> 27:47.520
 she told me that your
 marriage was a sham.

27:47.600 --> 27:48.920
 Why would she say that?

27:50.320 --> 27:52.360
 Probably still pining
 after me, poor woman.

 your personal life.

27:55.080 --> 27:56.280

 I'd rather do this here,

 down the station, I will,

28:01.200 --> 28:02.080

28:03.840 --> 28:05.560
 He told me that
 Prunella fired him,

28:05.640 --> 28:07.760
 because she caught him
 with a crew member,

28:07.840 --> 28:09.240
 but I don't think that's true.

 gonna expose you.

 than just the help.

 You're right, he's a hindrance,

 it is, it's over.

 she'd fired him.

29:20.880 --> 29:22.720
 And the footage?

29:22.800 --> 29:25.520
 I could see how hurt he was
 by what Prunella had said.

29:26.880 --> 29:31.240
 As he went passed me,
 I squeezed his hand,

29:32.640 --> 29:35.280

 I couldn't help myself.

 that you fired Azad?

 me how to talk to you.

 would try to kill me over that.
