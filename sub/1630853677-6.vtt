WEBVTT

00:10.594 --> 00:13.680
- Are you sure it's okay that
I'm not taking you to the airport?

00:13.680 --> 00:16.350
- Of course.
It's way too soon for the airport.

00:16.350 --> 00:18.310
He said, trying not to scare her off.

00:18.310 --> 00:20.354
- Even if we were married
with a townhouse and a dog,

00:20.354 --> 00:22.064
- it would still be too soon.
- Noted.

00:22.064 --> 00:23.857
-Daniel?
- Yeah.

00:23.857 --> 00:26.026
- Trunk's full and my cat's
loose in the back,

00:26.026 --> 00:27.236
but I'm your ride.

00:28.362 --> 00:29.863
This isn't how I die, is it?

00:32.783 --> 00:34.618
- I'll call you.
- I'll answer.

00:40.123 --> 00:41.416
- Wow, okay.
Wow.

00:41.416 --> 00:44.545
- You know what, seriously,
I'm gonna need a response to the

00:44.545 --> 00:46.713
"is this how I die" question.
Just before--

00:46.713 --> 00:48.048
Oh.

00:48.048 --> 00:49.466
I'm off the clock!

00:54.304 --> 00:57.975
Oh man. This is so fun!

00:57.975 --> 00:59.977
I love that we can have
a loud, drunken dinner outside

00:59.977 --> 01:02.563
and know that our neighbor isn't
gonna call in a noise complaint.

01:02.563 --> 01:04.773
- Well, there's no complaint
when the noise is Louise.

01:04.773 --> 01:06.567
- I just like that I can
hang out with you guys

01:06.567 --> 01:09.194
instead of my weird goth roommate
and her Gila monster.

01:10.696 --> 01:13.490
- Oh, Ben, did Mom drop off
some boxes of old stuff for you.

01:13.490 --> 01:15.450
- Oh no, did she get
a new self-help book?

01:15.450 --> 01:17.452
Yeah, so she's getting rid of things.

01:17.452 --> 01:19.788
Most of the boxes she gave me
are old self-help books.

01:19.788 --> 01:22.291
- Ooh, I love vintage self-help books.

01:22.291 --> 01:25.252
Ya know, I just miss when they used
to tell you to change your personality

01:25.252 --> 01:26.920
instead of, like, honoring it.

01:26.920 --> 01:28.213
No.

01:28.213 --> 01:30.257
- But I also found
some of Dad's old stuff.

01:30.257 --> 01:31.592
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:31.592 --> 01:32.509
Anything good?

01:32.509 --> 01:35.429
- Remember the old tortilla press
he taught me to cook on?

01:35.429 --> 01:38.056
- No!
- Yes! Took me right back.

01:38.515 --> 01:40.809
It's like I could smell the kitchen.
Mm.

01:40.809 --> 01:42.603
Well, maybe my bottle caps are in there.

01:42.603 --> 01:43.937
I know, I was thinking that.

01:43.937 --> 01:45.647
- Oh, we found
your grandmother's manatee.

01:45.647 --> 01:47.524
Amy's gonna wear it
on her face at the wedding.

01:47.524 --> 01:49.193
I am. I'm gonna wear it on my face,

01:49.193 --> 01:50.527
and he means <i>mantilla</i> .

01:50.527 --> 01:51.987
<i>- Mantilla, mantilla, mantilla.</i>

01:53.238 --> 01:56.241
- Which reminds me, you guys.
I need opinions, okay?

01:56.241 --> 01:58.243
- And be honest.
- That means lie, guys.

01:58.243 --> 02:00.495
- I've gone through all
of these wedding magazines.

02:00.495 --> 02:02.873
I still don't know which
kind of dress to go with.

02:02.873 --> 02:06.126
Why can't I be one of those women
who only has, like, one good silhouette?

02:06.126 --> 02:07.419
Mm!

02:12.132 --> 02:14.343
Oh! Yeah, you choose that one.

02:14.343 --> 02:16.136
- Wait, what? Are you sure?
- Yeah.

02:16.136 --> 02:18.138
Yeah, I just saw it.
You look gorgeous, by the way.

02:18.138 --> 02:20.766
You should have, like,
deer and birds following you around.

02:20.766 --> 02:23.310
- Oh, I love that idea!
Thank you so much, Maggie!

02:23.310 --> 02:24.520
Birds and deers?

02:24.520 --> 02:26.647
- You saved me 400 bucks
in wedding magazines.

02:26.647 --> 02:28.190
- I know.
- Dave, close your eyes.

02:28.190 --> 02:29.483
-Okay.
- Okay.

02:31.610 --> 02:34.112
- That is gorgeous.
- Wow, beautiful.

02:35.781 --> 02:37.783
â™ª

02:39.034 --> 02:40.118
Hey, girl.

02:40.118 --> 02:42.454
- Oh, hi.
- Hi. I just want to say thank you again

02:42.454 --> 02:43.914
for the wedding dress tip.

02:43.914 --> 02:45.207
- Oh.
- I brought you a coffee.

02:45.207 --> 02:46.625
- Ooh.
- It's my favorite.

02:46.625 --> 02:47.876
Whoa, that's heavy.

02:47.876 --> 02:49.336
- Mm-hm, it's mostly Baileys.

02:50.128 --> 02:53.340
Anywho, I was just wondering if maybe
I could get a more formal reading.

02:53.340 --> 02:56.677
You know, to just knock out some
of those details of the wedding?

02:56.677 --> 03:01.014
- Oh, Amy, uh...
I-I'd love to help you, but I just--

03:01.014 --> 03:03.600
It's, kind of, my policy
I don't give readings to friends

03:03.600 --> 03:05.519
- 'cause it gets a bit messy.
- Right.

03:05.519 --> 03:07.145
Yeah, Louise told me
that you might say that,

03:07.145 --> 03:10.148
so I came up with a list
of several compelling reasons

03:10.148 --> 03:11.692
why you and I are not really friends.

03:11.692 --> 03:14.403
One, I have no idea
when your birthday is.

03:14.403 --> 03:18.073
Two, even if I did know,
I wouldn't post about you on Instagram.

03:18.073 --> 03:19.283
Three, even if I did post,

03:19.283 --> 03:21.743
I'd make sure I still
look better in the photo.

03:21.743 --> 03:22.828
That's not real friendship.

03:22.828 --> 03:26.123
- I'd argue that's what most
friendship looks like these days.

03:26.123 --> 03:28.834
- Four, unless you're standing
directly in front of me,

03:28.834 --> 03:30.752
I have no idea what color eyes you have.

03:31.712 --> 03:32.921
They're really pretty, by the way.

03:32.921 --> 03:34.506
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

03:34.506 --> 03:36.258
Amy, look, I've been to your house,

03:36.258 --> 03:38.302
I borrowed clothes from you.

03:38.302 --> 03:39.219
We are friends.

03:39.219 --> 03:40.971
- What's my last name?
- Morales.

03:40.971 --> 03:43.849
- Come on, even the receptionist
at my dentist knows that,

03:43.849 --> 03:46.185
and she and I are <i>definitely</i> not friends.

03:46.185 --> 03:48.312
- Do you know what she said to me?
- No.

03:48.312 --> 03:50.105
- I'm gonna pull up
the text thread real quick.

03:50.105 --> 03:52.357
- Oh.
- I'm gonna have to go a few months back.

03:52.357 --> 03:55.360
Just gimme a minute.
Look at that meme.

03:55.360 --> 03:57.571
Okay, that's not it.

03:57.571 --> 04:00.032
Let me just take a seat
and get real comfy here.

04:00.032 --> 04:02.117
- You're sitting.
- Oh. Oh, is this it? That's not it.

04:02.117 --> 04:04.119
- Gimme, like, 15 minutes or so--
- Okay, you know what? It's fine.

04:04.119 --> 04:06.121
- I'll just give ya a reading.
- Thank you.

04:10.000 --> 04:11.668
I'm learning to be chill from Louise.

04:11.668 --> 04:13.629
- I should actually probably
use this on you.

04:13.629 --> 04:14.755
Mm, I feel that.

04:14.755 --> 04:15.881
- I love that.
- Okay.

04:17.466 --> 04:20.093
- Look, don't be embarrassed.
It happens all the time.

04:20.511 --> 04:22.846
I'm not. You're the one who farted.

04:22.846 --> 04:24.014
Hey.

04:24.014 --> 04:25.599
-Hey, what's up?
- Check it out.

04:25.599 --> 04:27.851
I finally got the boxes
from my mom's attic.

04:27.851 --> 04:29.978
There's supposed to be
some of my dad's stuff in here.

04:29.978 --> 04:31.647
Mother.

04:31.647 --> 04:34.650
- Uh, Amy told me about your dad.
I'm so sorry he passed.

04:34.650 --> 04:37.569
- Oh, thanks. It's been a rough
couple of years without him.

04:37.569 --> 04:38.654
I mean, we were pretty close.

04:38.654 --> 04:42.491
- Yeah, they used to go out on the porch
and talk for hours every night.

04:42.491 --> 04:44.660
- He'd always drink a beer
and I'd drink a soda,

04:44.660 --> 04:47.120
and we kept the bottle caps.
It was kind of our thing.

04:47.120 --> 04:48.413
I'm really hoping they're in here.

04:48.413 --> 04:50.374
Oh, I love that.

04:50.374 --> 04:53.293
My dad and I used to go
to the flea market together every Sunday.

04:53.293 --> 04:56.255
He really taught me how to see
the beauty in even the most ugly--

04:56.255 --> 04:58.590
Whoa! Old brown ties!

04:58.590 --> 05:01.426
- So weird.
My dad never wore a tie in his life.

05:01.426 --> 05:03.470
These must've been somebody else's.

05:03.470 --> 05:05.305
So, you're just gonna donate them, or?

05:05.305 --> 05:06.723
These are six inches thick,

05:06.723 --> 05:08.892
and smells like the time
I got my cast off.

05:08.892 --> 05:11.019
Even nostalgia has its limits.

05:11.019 --> 05:13.146
All right. Well, what about these?

05:13.146 --> 05:16.608
- No way!
Those are my uncle's favorite dress jeans.

05:16.608 --> 05:19.027
He used to wear them to weddings
and to do yard work.

05:19.027 --> 05:22.614
- Oh, this smells
like a dry horse.

05:22.614 --> 05:25.033
Okay, this is gonna be
my pile... over here.

05:26.243 --> 05:28.036
- Yeah, have at it.
- Oh, cute.

05:28.787 --> 05:30.831
- Okay, let's begin.
- Okay.

05:33.500 --> 05:34.918
- Ah, ooh!
- Sorry,

05:34.918 --> 05:37.296
I have that urge a lot,
and I can't do it with strangers.

05:37.296 --> 05:40.174
- You have a lot of rings, so.
- Okay, for real this time.

05:40.174 --> 05:41.008
Okay.

05:45.971 --> 05:48.640
<i>Oh, yeah, I see you
in your wedding dress.</i>

05:48.640 --> 05:50.934
Your back looks fantastic.

05:50.934 --> 05:53.020
- I'm sure I go on a cleanse.

05:54.605 --> 05:56.023
MAGGIE:
<i>Ooh, goin' for a plated dessert</i>

05:56.023 --> 05:58.025
<i>instead of a traditional wedding cake.</i>

05:58.025 --> 05:59.693
AMY:
<i>Of course, I'm not a Neanderthal.</i>

05:59.693 --> 06:01.111
MAGGIE:
<i>Oh, nope. There's the cake.</i>

06:01.111 --> 06:02.321
Damnit, Dave.

06:03.947 --> 06:08.202
Oh, now I see you... holding a baby.

06:08.702 --> 06:11.705
- A baby? W-We're having a baby?

06:11.705 --> 06:13.916
Dave and I didn't think
we were ready for that yet.

06:16.084 --> 06:16.919
MAGGIE:
<i>Oh, wait.</i>

06:16.919 --> 06:19.546
<i>Now your brother's holding the baby.</i>

06:20.589 --> 06:22.216
AMY:
<i>Okay, is it Ben's baby or is it my baby?</i>

06:22.216 --> 06:24.510
Because if Ben has a baby
before me, I will literally die.

06:24.510 --> 06:25.886
It's unclear.

06:27.638 --> 06:28.764
Oh, Dave's there now.

06:28.764 --> 06:30.557
- Like, what is happening?
And is it happening soon

06:30.557 --> 06:32.559
because I just bought a bunch
of really cute new bras.

06:33.602 --> 06:35.479
MAGGIE:
<i>You're hugging each other.</i>

06:35.479 --> 06:38.482
<i>Well, who's congratulating who?
Whose baby is it?</i>

06:39.233 --> 06:41.860
-<i>Dad?</i>
-<i>Yeah, who's the dad?</i>

06:45.072 --> 06:46.823
Baby's ugly, isn't it?

06:50.118 --> 06:51.620
â™ª

06:51.620 --> 06:54.831
- Okay, so I have been working
on this recipe for months.

06:55.999 --> 06:56.834
Ooh.

06:58.210 --> 07:00.254
Mmm... so good.

07:02.297 --> 07:03.841
- Fun work question.
- Mm?

07:03.841 --> 07:07.177
- Okay, well, I was with a client,
and, uh, I had a vision,

07:07.177 --> 07:10.389
and I would like to see
more of that vision.

07:11.598 --> 07:13.433
To help her. For her, the client.

07:13.433 --> 07:17.354
- Maggie, to go looking for more
is to go looking for trouble.

07:17.354 --> 07:19.773
Seeing the future is like
TV at my mom's house,

07:19.773 --> 07:22.985
it's best just to watch what's on
and what's on is <i>Reba</i> .

07:22.985 --> 07:24.194
Always <i>Reba</i> .

07:24.194 --> 07:28.615
- Okay, well, what I'm hearing is
that you don't know how to do it.

07:29.324 --> 07:32.578
- Oh, okay. I see you.
You wanna do this?

07:32.578 --> 07:33.579
Write this down.

07:34.454 --> 07:37.207
Get some paper... Come on.

07:37.207 --> 07:40.085
- You wanna get ya some witch hazel--
- Witch hazel.

07:40.085 --> 07:43.380
- eye of newt, a pinch of Gold Bond--
- Okay, slow down.

07:43.380 --> 07:45.382
- Girl, I cannot believe
you writin' this down.

07:45.382 --> 07:47.634
You know how to enhance a vision.

07:47.634 --> 07:49.303
Just keep your mind clear.

07:49.303 --> 07:52.431
And whatever you do,
do not get emotionally involved.

07:52.431 --> 07:54.892
- I'm not emotionally involved.
It has nothing to do with me.

07:54.892 --> 07:57.561
- Hm, that's what I said about <i>Reba</i> ,
but she sucks you in.

07:57.561 --> 07:58.687
She does.

07:59.521 --> 08:01.565
Throw this in the trash.

08:02.024 --> 08:04.067
- Rude.
- Mm-mm.

08:04.067 --> 08:06.069
â™ª

08:08.614 --> 08:10.657
Hey! Can I keep this?

08:10.657 --> 08:12.826
Yeah, just throw it in your pile.

08:13.785 --> 08:15.704
-What about this?
- I can't believe it.

08:15.704 --> 08:17.539
Box after box and all I got was

08:17.539 --> 08:20.709
"My mom went to Hawaii,
and all I got was this t-shirt" t-shirt.

08:20.709 --> 08:23.504
- So, are you gonna keep it?
- Aloha, dear shirt.

08:23.504 --> 08:25.506
Was that a hello or goodbye to it?

08:28.884 --> 08:30.886
- I really thought I'd find
the bottle caps here.

08:31.678 --> 08:34.014
- I'm so sorry, Ben. I mean,
we could start drinking a lot of beer

08:34.014 --> 08:35.557
and start our own collection.

08:35.557 --> 08:38.519
You know, be one of those
couples that loves beer?

08:38.519 --> 08:40.354
Never mind, I take it back.
I hate that idea.

08:40.354 --> 08:42.439
It's not just about the bottle caps.

08:42.439 --> 08:45.484
I, I wanna hold something in my hand,
and, you know, feel like that my dad

08:45.484 --> 08:47.861
is actually... with me.

08:47.861 --> 08:49.780
Well, you have your memories.

08:49.780 --> 08:52.074
I mean, remember when your dad
taught us both how to drive?

08:52.074 --> 08:56.370
And how to cry to get out of a ticket...
which somehow worked better for you.

08:57.037 --> 08:58.455
It's just not the same.

08:58.455 --> 09:01.291
Oh, Maggie's gonna love these.

09:01.291 --> 09:03.752
- Oh, oh, uh... those are
at least 10 years old.

09:03.752 --> 09:04.962
Oh, they're not for eating.

09:07.464 --> 09:09.550
â™ª

09:09.550 --> 09:11.844
Okay, so, explain it to me again.

09:11.844 --> 09:13.804
Okay, so Ben was there...

09:13.804 --> 09:15.430
- Mm-hm.
- ...and there was a baby.

09:15.430 --> 09:19.226
Amy and Dave were there, too.
And I don't know whose baby it is.

09:19.226 --> 09:21.228
Okay, and I was there, too, right?

09:21.228 --> 09:23.647
- No.
- Oh, okay. This is upsetting.

09:23.647 --> 09:26.108
- The weirdest part is
that my dad was there

09:26.108 --> 09:28.819
holding a "World's #1 Grandpa" mug.

09:28.819 --> 09:30.070
- What?!
- Yeah!

09:30.070 --> 09:32.322
Okay... your dad would be

09:32.322 --> 09:35.325
a good grandpa,
but world's number one?

09:35.325 --> 09:38.328
Lou, no. It could be my baby.

09:38.328 --> 09:40.622
With Ben. Remember?
I gave him that reading,

09:40.622 --> 09:42.332
and there was a baby.

09:42.332 --> 09:44.293
What if it's the same baby?

09:44.293 --> 09:46.128
Why else would my dad be holding that mug?

09:46.128 --> 09:49.381
- Hmm, well, it's kinda funny
you're jumping right to Ben

09:49.381 --> 09:53.051
when it could also be a baby with Daniel.

09:53.051 --> 09:56.263
- Yeah, but Ben was there,
and Daniel wasn't,

09:56.263 --> 09:59.558
so that's what's messing with my head.

09:59.558 --> 10:02.227
- Well... I'd like
to be able to help you out,

10:02.227 --> 10:04.730
but clearly, my invitation
to the vision of the year

10:04.730 --> 10:07.065
got lost somewhere in the mail, so.

10:07.065 --> 10:08.984
You're gonna have to go
to literally anybody else

10:08.984 --> 10:10.402
who was there to find out.

10:11.945 --> 10:13.947
That's actually a really good idea.

10:14.740 --> 10:16.325
Obviously, darling.

10:16.325 --> 10:19.786
And that's how I became a very rich woman.

10:19.786 --> 10:22.664
Oh, very intelligent indeed.

10:26.001 --> 10:27.419
- Dave--
- Yeah.

10:27.419 --> 10:28.587
- Thank you for coming.
- Don't touch.

10:28.587 --> 10:29.588
Oh yeah, for sure.

10:29.588 --> 10:32.716
Um, a little nervous.
I've never had anybody inside me.

10:33.592 --> 10:35.511
My head. I meant my head.

10:35.511 --> 10:37.262
First time for everything.

10:37.262 --> 10:38.764
All right.

10:38.764 --> 10:40.474
Let's find this baby, shall we?

10:40.474 --> 10:41.892
- Do it.
- Okay.

10:44.853 --> 10:46.855
â™ª

10:49.566 --> 10:51.985
<i>Oh, I'm seeing a birthday party.</i>

10:53.445 --> 10:55.322
Oh... it's for a little girl.

10:55.322 --> 10:57.407
- Aw, is it our girl?
- Huh.

10:57.407 --> 10:59.618
Um, it's <i>a</i> girl.

11:00.285 --> 11:02.120
<i>Oh, you guys are there.</i>

11:03.622 --> 11:04.915
<i>Ben, too.</i>

11:07.125 --> 11:10.504
- Yeah!
- You've got it. Now give it a big swing.

11:10.504 --> 11:11.713
Oh, jeez!

11:11.713 --> 11:14.091
- Oh god.
- What? What is it?

11:14.633 --> 11:17.761
- Oh, nothing.
She just, um... hit someone.

11:19.263 --> 11:21.890
Oh boy. She just hit my new knee!

11:21.890 --> 11:24.560
- He can't go five minutes
without bragging about that new knee.

11:24.560 --> 11:25.769
- Oh, sweetheart, no.

11:25.769 --> 11:28.063
It's fine, it's fine.
Don't worry about that.

11:28.063 --> 11:32.234
Here. Your mama's over there.
You go. Go run to mama.

11:32.234 --> 11:33.652
MAGGIE:
<i>Oh, she's running to her mom.</i>

11:35.362 --> 11:36.572
<i>Okay, she's running.</i>

11:37.531 --> 11:39.074
-Okay. Mm-hm.
- She's going.

11:39.074 --> 11:40.284
-<i>Uh-huh.</i>
-<i>She's running.</i>

11:43.412 --> 11:44.663
Who's her mom?

11:45.581 --> 11:47.082
I don't know.

11:47.082 --> 11:48.375
Who's her mom? Who's mommy?

11:48.375 --> 11:51.128
- What child is this?
- I don't... I don't know. I lost it.

11:51.128 --> 11:52.504
Okay, let's get it back.

11:52.504 --> 11:54.131
- Okay.
Now really focus.

11:58.051 --> 11:59.803
Uch, it's just your wedding again.

11:59.803 --> 12:02.055
How many hype dancers do you need?

12:02.055 --> 12:04.183
- Between eight and 14.
Go back to the little girl.

12:04.183 --> 12:05.475
- Yeah, d-does she have an Aussie accent?

12:05.475 --> 12:07.811
Does she call me Appa?
Is she a weightlifter?

12:09.438 --> 12:11.315
- Okay, you know what?
Clearly, this isn't working.

12:11.315 --> 12:14.276
You guys are too emotionally involved.
Could you just calm down?!

12:16.195 --> 12:17.404
I'm sorry.

12:18.488 --> 12:20.240
â™ª

12:20.240 --> 12:22.951
-Hi.
- Hey. Oh. Movin' out already?

12:22.951 --> 12:25.287
I'm just grabbing some old family stuff.

12:25.287 --> 12:28.248
- Oh, that must be pretty emotional.
- Huh, I wish.

12:28.248 --> 12:31.793
I have no sentimental
attachment to any of it.

12:31.793 --> 12:33.128
- Hm.
- So, what am I gonna do?

12:33.128 --> 12:36.173
Hand down a bunch of old socks
and power cords to my kid?

12:36.173 --> 12:39.468
- Your kid?
I don't know anything about your kid.

12:40.427 --> 12:43.138
- Yeah, I, I guess I should
be like my Abuela Rosie.

12:43.138 --> 12:46.350
She always said, "Hold on to nothing
and eat a lot of fiber."

12:46.934 --> 12:48.310
Those were actually the same lesson.

12:48.310 --> 12:52.064
- Wait, I'm sorry. Did you say Rosie?
- Yeah. Oh, I love that name.

12:52.064 --> 12:55.150
You know, Amy and I used to argue about
who would get to name their kid Rosie.

12:55.150 --> 12:58.111
- And, uh, just out of curiosity,
who won that argument?

12:58.111 --> 13:01.323
- Uh... whoever has
the first kid, I guess.

13:01.323 --> 13:03.659
Okay, so it's just a

13:03.659 --> 13:06.286
good ol' fashioned
race down the birth canal.

13:06.286 --> 13:09.331
Okay, well, uh, good luck

13:09.331 --> 13:11.250
sorting through your past.

13:11.250 --> 13:12.251
Thanks, Maggie.

13:12.251 --> 13:15.254
- Good luck sorting through your future.
- Oh... that's a good one.

13:17.631 --> 13:19.258
Oh, careful. You good?

13:19.258 --> 13:20.259
- Uh-huh.
- All right.

13:22.803 --> 13:26.390
- So, how's, um, Cincinnati?
- Oh, it's beautiful.

13:26.390 --> 13:28.934
So much brown grass this time of year.

13:28.934 --> 13:31.395
<i>How are you? Maggie?</i>

13:31.395 --> 13:33.272
Did you hear my thing
about the brown grass?

13:33.272 --> 13:36.316
- Wh-- Oh, yeah.
Uh, sorry.

13:36.316 --> 13:38.235
I've just been really distracted
with work this week.

13:38.235 --> 13:40.612
Oh, uh, speaking of...

13:40.612 --> 13:42.656
I need to take this.

13:42.656 --> 13:45.242
- Gone for one day and you're already
havin' phone sex with someone else?

13:45.242 --> 13:49.037
- Oh, no, that is not what I do for work.
I'll talk to you later.

13:49.037 --> 13:51.874
<i>- Hi, um, Dave and I need to talk
to you about some sex stuff.</i>

13:51.874 --> 13:54.668
- Hey, Maggie. Hey, is tonight
the night we go for the baby?

13:54.668 --> 13:57.337
Uh, because we're horny, but we're scared,
which is making us even more horny.

13:57.337 --> 13:58.672
- Uh-huh, and even more scared.

13:58.672 --> 14:01.758
- Oh, I, I don't really think I should--
<i>Do we even want kids right now?</i>

14:01.758 --> 14:04.761
- Yeah. Yeah, if you could tell us
what we want right now, that'd be great.

14:04.761 --> 14:06.930
- Oh, no, I definitely can't
tell you what you want.

14:06.930 --> 14:09.266
- Look, if we're gonna have a baby,
we need to know when we should start.

14:09.266 --> 14:11.435
- And if you can tell us
what to do with our bodies,

14:11.435 --> 14:13.312
- uh, and possibly mouths, just in case.
- And our mouths.

14:13.312 --> 14:15.439
- Okay, maybe I shouldn't have
given you so many readings.

14:15.439 --> 14:17.816
<i>- Did your first vision seem like
it was nine months from today?</i>

14:17.816 --> 14:20.068
<i>Did you see any newspapers
with dates on it?</i>

14:20.068 --> 14:21.737
<i>Like, what model phone was I holding?</i>

14:21.737 --> 14:24.281
- Whoa, I'm gonna need you guys
to just take a step back.

14:24.281 --> 14:26.783
You know, I did not mean
for you to become obsessed.

14:26.783 --> 14:28.744
- We're not obsessed. No.
- Oh, we're not obsessed. No, no, no.

14:28.744 --> 14:30.412
- We just can't think about anything else.
- Right,

14:30.412 --> 14:32.998
and I'm already very, very
competitive with other mothers.

14:32.998 --> 14:34.458
I dismantled my knife wall.

14:34.458 --> 14:36.460
â™ª

14:41.215 --> 14:43.425
- Are you kidding me?
It is 1:00 in the morning.

14:43.425 --> 14:46.553
- Okay, it is, like, 9:30,
and it is an emergency.

14:47.429 --> 14:48.472
What's wrong?

14:48.472 --> 14:50.766
- Okay, well, you know that thing that
you told me not to do?

14:50.766 --> 14:53.185
I did it, and I might've
ruined two peoples' lives.

14:54.186 --> 14:55.604
Bitch, three.

14:56.396 --> 14:58.398
â™ª

15:00.901 --> 15:02.861
-My god.
- I know, I'm sorry.

15:02.861 --> 15:06.198
I just-- I'm in a pickle,
and I really need your help.

15:06.198 --> 15:08.200
Who is Maria Carey?

15:08.200 --> 15:11.954
- The merch guy outside the concert
was not affiliated with the concert.

15:11.954 --> 15:13.956
And speaking of people
getting involved in things

15:13.956 --> 15:17.835
- they should not be getting involved in.
- Okay, I couldn't help it.

15:17.835 --> 15:21.839
Maybe the vision, kind of,
sort of, possibly, involved me?

15:22.381 --> 15:25.676
- Hold up, so you let somebody
compulsively look into their future

15:25.676 --> 15:28.303
so you could compulsively look into yours?

15:28.929 --> 15:32.558
- That is a very accurate summary.
That feels like an attack.

15:33.475 --> 15:35.936
- How bad is it?
- Things couldn't get any worse?

15:35.936 --> 15:38.230
- Oh, they could get worse.
You could make that soup again.

15:38.230 --> 15:40.816
- Wait, no. That wasn't soup.
That was a casserole.

15:40.816 --> 15:43.652
- Honey, if that was casserole,
this is Mariah.

15:44.111 --> 15:45.821
Okay, please just tell me what to do.

15:45.821 --> 15:48.407
- You're gonna give them their money back.
- No, they're rich.

15:49.366 --> 15:51.869
- You're gonna keep the money
and buy me a gift

15:51.869 --> 15:53.036
because I'mma get you out of this.

15:53.036 --> 15:57.040
- Thank you.
- Mm-hm. Here we go with the hugs.

15:57.040 --> 15:58.584
M'kay, go home.

15:58.584 --> 16:00.335
- No, what are we watching?
- We're going home.

16:00.335 --> 16:02.254
- <i>Hocus Pocus</i> is on.
- Ooh.

16:02.254 --> 16:04.923
- "Another beautiful morning."
- Ooh! Let's go.

16:04.923 --> 16:07.259
â™ª

16:07.259 --> 16:09.178
- Thank you.
- Last chance to change your mind.

16:09.178 --> 16:10.637
You can't get any of this stuff back.

16:10.637 --> 16:12.764
Yeah, I can't get a lot of things back.

16:12.764 --> 16:14.892
- Well, you could probably get
the brown ties back if you run.

16:14.892 --> 16:17.311
- No, I'm good.
I can smell them from here. Thank you.

16:18.896 --> 16:21.523
- Yoo-hoo! Sorry, announced visitor.
- Oh.

16:22.149 --> 16:24.443
Uh, Ben, you should have this.

16:24.443 --> 16:27.321
- Oh, that's okay.
I really don't need a boombox.

16:27.321 --> 16:29.698
Not the boombox. The tape.

16:31.158 --> 16:33.619
YOUNG BEN:
<i>Four score and seven years ago.</i>

16:33.619 --> 16:35.245
- Is that you?
- Yeah.

16:35.245 --> 16:37.664
I was practicing for that
presidential wax museum

16:37.664 --> 16:39.416
we did in the fifth grade.
I was Lincoln.

16:39.416 --> 16:42.044
Oh yeah, and I was Chester A. Arthur.

16:42.044 --> 16:43.253
The parents walked around the gym,

16:43.253 --> 16:46.215
and they had to make us talk
by pressing those buttons on our bodies.

16:47.007 --> 16:48.133
I don't think they do that anymore.

16:48.133 --> 16:50.219
I should call and make sure
they don't do that anymore.

16:50.219 --> 16:52.304
<i>This is so boring.</i>

16:52.304 --> 16:53.931
BEN'S DAD:
<i>History's not boring.</i>

16:54.389 --> 16:56.058
Whoa, that's... that's my dad.

16:56.058 --> 16:58.018
BEN'S DAD: <i>It's our guide
for how to do everything.</i>

16:58.018 --> 16:59.311
<i>Â¿QuÃ© te pasa?</i>

16:59.311 --> 17:02.022
<i>Lincoln had to be brave giving his speech</i>

17:02.022 --> 17:04.983
<i>in the same way you have
to be brave giving yours.</i>

17:04.983 --> 17:06.610
YOUNG BEN:
<i>I don't know.</i>

17:06.610 --> 17:07.569
BEN'S DAD:
<i>He did!</i>

17:07.569 --> 17:09.738
<i>And he taught us
that when we're brave,</i>

17:09.738 --> 17:11.615
<i>good things happen, huh?</i>

17:11.615 --> 17:13.575
<i>Just because you can't see the past</i>

17:13.575 --> 17:16.537
<i>doesn't mean it's not there
to guide you,</i> mijo.

17:16.537 --> 17:19.456
- I-I remember this day.

17:20.207 --> 17:21.834
We, uh--

17:21.834 --> 17:24.419
My dad and I were sitting out
on the porch with our drinks,

17:25.504 --> 17:27.965
and... that's where he would tell me

17:27.965 --> 17:32.261
all about his life in Cuba... the world.

17:32.970 --> 17:34.179
The past.

17:36.765 --> 17:38.976
He's why I became a history teacher.

17:39.977 --> 17:43.605
Wow... That's better than bottle caps.

17:44.398 --> 17:45.566
Way better.

17:45.566 --> 17:48.110
- Well, don't forget
your accessory, Mr. Lincoln.

17:48.110 --> 17:49.987
- Of course!

17:50.404 --> 17:53.657
Oh my gosh! This was the hat! Oh!

17:53.657 --> 17:55.367
LOUISE:
Sorry if it's a little sandy in there

17:55.367 --> 17:57.828
'cause I took it to the beach
and... put sand in it.

17:57.828 --> 17:58.829
Oh, okay.

17:58.829 --> 18:01.373
- Thank you so much
for bringing this back, Louise.

18:01.373 --> 18:03.792
- Of course.
- Really, thank you.

18:06.253 --> 18:07.796
- Oh, wait, wait, wait.
So, you're just gonna

18:07.796 --> 18:10.007
keep the boombox, then? Okay.

18:10.007 --> 18:13.051
It's not like I ordered a bunch
of cool stickers to put on it or anything.

18:13.051 --> 18:15.053
â™ª

18:16.054 --> 18:20.267
- M'kay, how to explain this,
how to explain this.

18:20.267 --> 18:23.187
Do you remember <i>The Sorcerer's Apprentice</i>
from <i>Fantasia</i> ?

18:23.645 --> 18:25.147
The hat. That's Mickey, right?

18:25.147 --> 18:26.231
- Yes, that's right.
- Mm-hm.

18:26.231 --> 18:28.275
Mickey was the apprentice. Very good.

18:28.275 --> 18:30.569
Well, he gets in
a little bit over his head,

18:30.569 --> 18:32.779
- the mops and the brooms--
- I never saw that movie.

18:33.280 --> 18:34.448
- Seriously?
- Mm-mm.

18:34.448 --> 18:36.867
No, I never saw <i>Fantasia</i> .
Never saw <i>Caddyshack</i> .
- Uh-uh. What?!

18:36.867 --> 18:38.619
- Well, I told you this.
- What? Who? I'm--

18:38.619 --> 18:40.829
- Heterosexuals! Please!
- Sorry.

18:40.829 --> 18:44.333
- Listen... Maggie went too far,
and I am the sorcerer here

18:44.333 --> 18:45.459
to clean up her mess.

18:45.459 --> 18:48.420
Now, for your good and for hers,
she cannot do any more readings for you.

18:48.420 --> 18:49.421
- Okay.
- Oh.

18:51.006 --> 18:54.009
- I really want to say I'm sorry,
but I'm afraid I'm not allowed to talk.

18:54.009 --> 18:55.636
- You may speak.
- Okay.

18:55.636 --> 18:57.804
I feel terrible that
things got out of hand.

18:57.804 --> 19:01.225
I got... emotionally involved.

19:01.225 --> 19:02.935
What? Why?

19:03.727 --> 19:04.728
Because

19:06.021 --> 19:09.650
you guys are my friends,
and what I saw showed me

19:09.650 --> 19:12.861
that we're gonna be friends
for a long time, and--

19:12.861 --> 19:13.695
BOTH:
Aw.

19:13.695 --> 19:16.657
- Shivers.
- Maggie. I know. That's really sweet.

19:17.241 --> 19:19.785
But what I'm hearing is
you can't be our psychic anymore,

19:19.785 --> 19:20.911
but Angel can.
Mm-hm.

19:20.911 --> 19:22.079
- Oh, I can.
- 'Kay.

19:22.079 --> 19:24.206
- But we need to break
your baby fever cold turkey.

19:24.206 --> 19:27.292
And when you come back to me,
you will not dictate what I see for you.

19:27.292 --> 19:28.293
The universe will.

19:28.293 --> 19:32.089
And my experience and charm
will dictate my prices,

19:32.089 --> 19:33.882
which are a lot higher than Maggie's.

19:33.882 --> 19:35.342
- Understood.
- That's fine.

19:35.342 --> 19:36.260
Just so we're clear.

19:37.010 --> 19:38.011
Angel's right.

19:38.011 --> 19:41.181
I may no longer be able to tell you
if you're gonna be parents,

19:41.181 --> 19:43.308
but... as your friend,

19:43.308 --> 19:46.228
I can tell you guys that
you would be great ones.

19:46.228 --> 19:47.229
Aw.

19:48.188 --> 19:50.315
I do have to admit, babe,

19:50.315 --> 19:53.193
that I loved how excited
you got about being a dad.

19:54.069 --> 19:56.071
You're gonna be an amazing Appa.

19:56.989 --> 19:59.867
- And you're gonna be right up there
with the best mothers of the world.

20:01.034 --> 20:05.247
Teresa... Superior... Goose.

20:09.501 --> 20:11.503
â™ª

20:17.634 --> 20:19.469
MARIA:
Maggie, what's, um--

20:20.262 --> 20:21.513
What are you doing with your face there?

20:21.513 --> 20:23.182
- What is that?
- I'm smiling.

20:23.182 --> 20:25.225
- Uh-oh, you need money?

20:25.225 --> 20:26.768
- Jack, don't make her beg.
Just give her the money.

20:26.768 --> 20:28.312
Guys, I'm fine. I don't need money.

20:28.312 --> 20:29.521
Mmm.

20:31.273 --> 20:32.691
- Mm. Mm-mm. Mm.

20:33.400 --> 20:34.776
W-Why do you have that mug?

20:36.069 --> 20:37.070
Oh.

20:37.070 --> 20:39.406
You know, the orthodontist
down in my, uh, office building,

20:39.406 --> 20:41.491
he's always stealing my parking spot,

20:41.491 --> 20:43.535
so I stole his coffee mug.

20:45.412 --> 20:47.206
Mm, and a couple of retainers.

20:47.206 --> 20:49.249
- I was gonna make
Christmas ornaments out of them.

20:49.249 --> 20:51.502
Turns out they're used.
Joke's on us.

21:02.054 --> 21:05.974
Oh my gosh! An airport pickup?

21:05.974 --> 21:09.645
- I hope it's not too soon, she said,
meaning it completely.

21:09.645 --> 21:10.729
Not at all.

21:11.647 --> 21:12.898
- Hi.
- Hi.

21:12.898 --> 21:14.441
- You made a whole sign and everything.
- Oh.

21:14.441 --> 21:17.945
Yeah, actually, this was a terrible idea.
I've had several unsavory offers.

21:17.945 --> 21:20.781
- Who? Who? Point him out.

21:20.781 --> 21:22.616
- Okay, let's go.
I didn't park in a real spot.

21:22.616 --> 21:23.825
Oh, okay.
