00:10.594 --> 00:13.680
- Are you sure it's okay that
I'm not taking you to the airport?

00:13.680 --> 00:16.350
- Of course.
It's way too soon for the airport.

00:16.350 --> 00:18.310
He said, trying not to scare her off.

00:18.310 --> 00:20.354
- Even if we were married
with a townhouse and a dog,

00:20.354 --> 00:22.064
- it would still be too soon.
- Noted.

00:22.064 --> 00:23.857
-Daniel?
- Yeah.

00:23.857 --> 00:26.026
- Trunk's full and my cat's
loose in the back,

00:26.026 --> 00:27.236
but I'm your ride.

00:28.362 --> 00:29.863
This isn't how I die, is it?

00:32.783 --> 00:34.618
- I'll call you.
- I'll answer.

00:40.123 --> 00:41.416
- Wow, okay.
Wow.

00:41.416 --> 00:44.545
- You know what, seriously,
I'm gonna need a response to the

00:44.545 --> 00:46.713
"is this how I die" question.
Just before--

00:46.713 --> 00:48.048
Oh.

00:48.048 --> 00:49.466
I'm off the clock!

00:54.304 --> 00:57.975
Oh man. This is so fun!

00:57.975 --> 00:59.977
I love that we can have
a loud, drunken dinner outside

00:59.977 --> 01:02.563
and know that our neighbor isn't
gonna call in a noise complaint.

01:02.563 --> 01:04.773
- Well, there's no complaint
when the noise is Louise.

01:04.773 --> 01:06.567
- I just like that I can
hang out with you guys

01:06.567 --> 01:09.194
instead of my weird goth roommate
and her Gila monster.

01:10.696 --> 01:13.490
- Oh, Ben, did Mom drop off
some boxes of old stuff for you.

01:13.490 --> 01:15.450
- Oh no, did she get
a new self-help book?

01:15.450 --> 01:17.452
Yeah, so she's getting rid of things.

01:17.452 --> 01:19.788
Most of the boxes she gave me
are old self-help books.

01:19.788 --> 01:22.291
- Ooh, I love vintage self-help books.

01:22.291 --> 01:25.252
Ya know, I just miss when they used
to tell you to change your personality

01:25.252 --> 01:26.920
instead of, like, honoring it.

01:26.920 --> 01:28.213
No.

01:28.213 --> 01:30.257
- But I also found
some of Dad's old stuff.

01:30.257 --> 01:31.592
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:31.592 --> 01:32.509
Anything good?

01:32.509 --> 01:35.429
- Remember the old tortilla press
he taught me to cook on?

01:35.429 --> 01:38.056
- No!
- Yes! Took me right back.

01:38.515 --> 01:40.809
It's like I could smell the kitchen.
Mm.

01:40.809 --> 01:42.603
Well, maybe my bottle caps are in there.

01:42.603 --> 01:43.937
I know, I was thinking that.

01:43.937 --> 01:45.647
- Oh, we found
your grandmother's manatee.

01:45.647 --> 01:47.524
Amy's gonna wear it
on her face at the wedding.

01:47.524 --> 01:49.193
I am. I'm gonna wear it on my face,

01:49.193 --> 01:50.527
and he means <i>mantilla</i> .

01:50.527 --> 01:51.987
<i>- Mantilla, mantilla, mantilla.</i>

01:53.238 --> 01:56.241
- Which reminds me, you guys.
I need opinions, okay?

01:56.241 --> 01:58.243
- And be honest.
- That means lie, guys.

01:58.243 --> 02:00.495
- I've gone through all
of these wedding magazines.

02:00.495 --> 02:02.873
I still don't know which
kind of dress to go with.

02:02.873 --> 02:06.126
Why can't I be one of those women
who only has, like, one good silhouette?

02:06.126 --> 02:07.419
Mm!

02:12.132 --> 02:14.343
Oh! Yeah, you choose that one.

02:14.343 --> 02:16.136
- Wait, what? Are you sure?
- Yeah.

02:16.136 --> 02:18.138
Yeah, I just saw it.
You look gorgeous, by the way.

02:18.138 --> 02:20.766
You should have, like,
deer and birds following you around.

02:20.766 --> 02:23.310
- Oh, I love that idea!
Thank you so much, Maggie!

02:23.310 --> 02:24.520
Birds and deers?

02:24.520 --> 02:26.647
- You saved me 400 bucks
in wedding magazines.

02:26.647 --> 02:28.190
- I know.
- Dave, close your eyes.

02:28.190 --> 02:29.483
-Okay.
- Okay.

02:31.610 --> 02:34.112
- That is gorgeous.
- Wow, beautiful.

02:35.781 --> 02:37.783
♪

02:39.034 --> 02:40.118
Hey, girl.

02:40.118 --> 02:42.454
- Oh, hi.
- Hi. I just want to say thank you again

02:42.454 --> 02:43.914
for the wedding dress tip.

02:43.914 --> 02:45.207
- Oh.
- I brought you a coffee.

02:45.207 --> 02:46.625
- Ooh.
- It's my favorite.

02:46.625 --> 02:47.876
Whoa, that's heavy.

02:47.876 --> 02:49.336
- Mm-hm, it's mostly Baileys.

02:50.128 --> 02:53.340
Anywho, I was just wondering if maybe
I could get a more formal reading.

02:53.340 --> 02:56.677
You know, to just knock out some
of those details of the wedding?

02:56.677 --> 03:01.014
- Oh, Amy, uh...
I-I'd love to help you, but I just--

03:01.014 --> 03:03.600
It's, kind of, my policy
I don't give readings to friends

03:03.600 --> 03:05.519
- 'cause it gets a bit messy.
- Right.

03:05.519 --> 03:07.145
Yeah, Louise told me
that you might say that,

03:07.145 --> 03:10.148
so I came up with a list
of several compelling reasons

03:10.148 --> 03:11.692
why you and I are not really friends.

03:11.692 --> 03:14.403
One, I have no idea
when your birthday is.

03:14.403 --> 03:18.073
Two, even if I did know,
I wouldn't post about you on Instagram.

03:18.073 --> 03:19.283
Three, even if I did post,

03:19.283 --> 03:21.743
I'd make sure I still
look better in the photo.

03:21.743 --> 03:22.828
That's not real friendship.

03:22.828 --> 03:26.123
- I'd argue that's what most
friendship looks like these days.

03:26.123 --> 03:28.834
- Four, unless you're standing
directly in front of me,

03:28.834 --> 03:30.752
I have no idea what color eyes you have.

03:31.712 --> 03:32.921
They're really pretty, by the way.

03:32.921 --> 03:34.506
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

03:34.506 --> 03:36.258
Amy, look, I've been to your house,

03:36.258 --> 03:38.302
I borrowed clothes from you.

03:38.302 --> 03:39.219
We are friends.

03:39.219 --> 03:40.971
- What's my last name?
- Morales.

03:40.971 --> 03:43.849
- Come on, even the receptionist
at my dentist knows that,

03:43.849 --> 03:46.185
and she and I are <i>definitely</i> not friends.

03:46.185 --> 03:48.312
- Do you know what she said to me?
- No.

03:48.312 --> 03:50.105
- I'm gonna pull up
the text thread real quick.

03:50.105 --> 03:52.357
- Oh.
- I'm gonna have to go a few months back.

03:52.357 --> 03:55.360
Just gimme a minute.
Look at that meme.

03:55.360 --> 03:57.571
Okay, that's not it.

03:57.571 --> 04:00.032
Let me just take a seat
and get real comfy here.

04:00.032 --> 04:02.117
- You're sitting.
- Oh. Oh, is this it? That's not it.

04:02.117 --> 04:04.119
- Gimme, like, 15 minutes or so--
- Okay, you know what? It's fine.

04:04.119 --> 04:06.121
- I'll just give ya a reading.
- Thank you.

04:10.000 --> 04:11.668
I'm learning to be chill from Louise.

04:11.668 --> 04:13.629
- I should actually probably
use this on you.

04:13.629 --> 04:14.755
Mm, I feel that.

04:14.755 --> 04:15.881
- I love that.
- Okay.

04:17.466 --> 04:20.093
- Look, don't be embarrassed.
It happens all the time.

04:20.511 --> 04:22.846
I'm not. You're the one who farted.

04:22.846 --> 04:24.014
Hey.

04:24.014 --> 04:25.599
-Hey, what's up?
- Check it out.

04:25.599 --> 04:27.851
I finally got the boxes
from my mom's attic.

04:27.851 --> 04:29.978
There's supposed to be
some of my dad's stuff in here.

04:29.978 --> 04:31.647
Mother.

04:31.647 --> 04:34.650
- Uh, Amy told me about your dad.
I'm so sorry he passed.

04:34.650 --> 04:37.569
- Oh, thanks. It's been a rough
couple of years without him.

04:37.569 --> 04:38.654
I mean, we were pretty close.

04:38.654 --> 04:42.491
- Yeah, they used to go out on the porch
and talk for hours every night.

04:42.491 --> 04:44.660
- He'd always drink a beer
and I'd drink a soda,

04:44.660 --> 04:47.120
and we kept the bottle caps.
It was kind of our thing.

04:47.120 --> 04:48.413
I'm really hoping they're in here.

04:48.413 --> 04:50.374
Oh, I love that.

04:50.374 --> 04:53.293
My dad and I used to go
to the flea market together every Sunday.

04:53.293 --> 04:56.255
He really taught me how to see
the beauty in even the most ugly--

04:56.255 --> 04:58.590
Whoa! Old brown ties!

04:58.590 --> 05:01.426
- So weird.
My dad never wore a tie in his life.

05:01.426 --> 05:03.470
These must've been somebody else's.

05:03.470 --> 05:05.305
So, you're just gonna donate them, or?

05:05.305 --> 05:06.723
These are six inches thick,

05:06.723 --> 05:08.892
and smells like the time
I got my cast off.

05:08.892 --> 05:11.019
Even nostalgia has its limits.

05:11.019 --> 05:13.146
All right. Well, what about these?

05:13.146 --> 05:16.608
- No way!
Those are my uncle's favorite dress jeans.

05:16.608 --> 05:19.027
He used to wear them to weddings
and to do yard work.

05:19.027 --> 05:22.614
- Oh, this smells
like a dry horse.

05:22.614 --> 05:25.033
Okay, this is gonna be
my pile... over here.

05:26.243 --> 05:28.036
- Yeah, have at it.
- Oh, cute.

05:28.787 --> 05:30.831

- Okay.

05:33.500 --> 05:34.918

- Sorry,

05:34.918 --> 05:37.296
I have that urge a lot,
and I can't do it with strangers.

05:37.296 --> 05:40.174
- You have a lot of rings, so.
- Okay, for real this time.

05:40.174 --> 05:41.008

18:44.333 --> 18:45.459
to clean up her mess.

18:45.459 --> 18:48.420
Now, for your good and for hers,
she cannot do any more readings for you.

18:48.420 --> 18:49.421
- Okay.
- Oh.

18:51.006 --> 18:54.009
- I really want to say I'm sorry,
but I'm afraid I'm not allowed to talk.

18:54.009 --> 18:55.636
- You may speak.
- Okay.

18:55.636 --> 18:57.804
I feel terrible that
things got out of hand.

18:57.804 --> 19:01.225
I got... emotionally involved.

19:01.225 --> 19:02.935
What? Why?

19:03.727 --> 19:04.728
Because

19:06.021 --> 19:09.650
you guys are my friends,
and what I saw showed me

19:09.650 --> 19:12.861
that we're gonna be friends
for a long time, and--

19:12.861 --> 19:13.695
BOTH:
Aw.

19:13.695 --> 19:16.657
- Shivers.
- Maggie. I know. That's really sweet.

19:17.241 --> 19:19.785
But what I'm hearing is
you can't be our psychic anymore,

19:19.785 --> 19:20.911
but Angel can.
Mm-hm.

19:20.911 --> 19:22.079
- Oh, I can.
- 'Kay.

19:22.079 --> 19:24.206
- But we need to break
your baby fever cold turkey.

19:24.206 --> 19:27.292
And when you come back to me,
you will not dictate what I see for you.

19:27.292 --> 19:28.293
The universe will.

19:28.293 --> 19:32.089
And my experience and charm
will dictate my prices,

19:32.089 --> 19:33.882
which are a lot higher than Maggie's.

19:33.882 --> 19:35.342
- Understood.
- That's fine.

19:35.342 --> 19:36.260
Just so we're clear.

19:37.010 --> 19:38.011
Angel's right.

19:38.011 --> 19:41.181
I may no longer be able to tell you
if you're gonna be parents,

19:41.181 --> 19:43.308
but... as your friend,

19:43.308 --> 19:46.228
I can tell you guys that
you would be great ones.

19:46.228 --> 19:47.229
Aw.

19:48.188 --> 19:50.315
I do have to admit, babe,

19:50.315 --> 19:53.193
that I loved how excited
you got about being a dad.

19:54.069 --> 19:56.071
You're gonna be an amazing Appa.

19:56.989 --> 19:59.867
- And you're gonna be right up there
with the best mothers of the world.

20:01.034 --> 20:05.247
Teresa... Superior... Goose.

20:09.501 --> 20:11.503
♪

20:17.634 --> 20:19.469
MARIA:
Maggie, what's, um--

20:20.262 --> 20:21.513
What are you doing with your face there?

20:21.513 --> 20:23.182
- What is that?
- I'm smiling.

20:23.182 --> 20:25.225
- Uh-oh, you need money?

20:25.225 --> 20:26.768
- Jack, don't make her beg.
Just give her the money.

20:26.768 --> 20:28.312
Guys, I'm fine. I don't need money.

20:28.312 --> 20:29.521
Mmm.

20:31.273 --> 20:32.691
- Mm. Mm-mm. Mm.

20:33.400 --> 20:34.776
W-Why do you have that mug?

20:36.069 --> 20:37.070
Oh.

20:37.070 --> 20:39.406
You know, the orthodontist
down in my, uh, office building,

20:39.406 --> 20:41.491
he's always stealing my parking spot,

20:41.491 --> 20:43.535
so I stole his coffee mug.

20:45.412 --> 20:47.206
Mm, and a couple of retainers.

20:47.206 --> 20:49.249
- I was gonna make
Christmas ornaments out of them.

20:49.249 --> 20:51.502
Turns out they're used.
Joke's on us.

21:02.054 --> 21:05.974
Oh my gosh! An airport pickup?

21:05.974 --> 21:09.645
- I hope it's not too soon, she said,
meaning it completely.

21:09.645 --> 21:10.729
Not at all.

21:11.647 --> 21:12.898
- Hi.
- Hi.

21:12.898 --> 21:14.441
- You made a whole sign and everything.
- Oh.

21:14.441 --> 21:17.945
Yeah, actually, this was a terrible idea.
I've had several unsavory offers.

21:17.945 --> 21:20.781
- Who? Who? Point him out.

21:20.781 --> 21:22.616
- Okay, let's go.
I didn't park in a real spot.

21:22.616 --> 21:23.825
Oh, okay.
