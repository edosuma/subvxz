01:00.775 --> 01:01.769
Excellent.

01:18.316 --> 01:21.065
Don't worry.
I'll put out the flames.

01:21.967 --> 01:24.571
Oops!
I used the wrong end.

01:30.507 --> 01:31.947
Hilarious!

01:32.072 --> 01:33.384
I don't like this.

01:33.552 --> 01:36.512
Real humor comes from people
being nice to each other.

01:36.680 --> 01:37.918
Aw, come on, Marge.

01:38.043 --> 01:40.728
There's nothing funnier than
a good old bonk on the head.

01:40.853 --> 01:42.727
- I concur.
- D'oh!

01:43.654 --> 01:44.520
Not funny.

01:44.688 --> 01:47.732
Good night kids, and don't forget,
Krusty loves you!

01:48.332 --> 01:49.636
That's a wrap!

01:50.203 --> 01:53.624
And you kids in the studio audience,
please hand back all the hats, toys,

01:53.749 --> 01:55.906
and savings bonds
I passed out during the taping.

02:01.671 --> 02:02.939
Great show, Krusty.

02:03.064 --> 02:04.800
Terrific!
We've got to make changes.

02:04.958 --> 02:05.958
Big changes.

02:06.126 --> 02:08.160
These are your ratings
with young girls.

02:08.285 --> 02:10.589
Hey, if my writers knew
how to appeal to girls,

02:10.714 --> 02:12.257
they wouldn't be writers.

02:12.847 --> 02:15.634
First of all, we love being
in the Krusty business.

02:15.976 --> 02:18.609
The subtitle:
"We don't trust you at all."

02:18.734 --> 02:21.480
Anyway, we're giving you a new
female co-star and she starts Monday.

02:21.605 --> 02:23.768
What?!
A new co-star?!

02:23.991 --> 02:26.270
Suppose I refuse
to go along with this?

02:26.438 --> 02:28.341
Then we've got
an entire reality show

02:28.466 --> 02:30.191
all set to pick the new you.

02:30.486 --> 02:32.693
Hey, hey!
I'm non-union!

02:33.146 --> 02:35.224
Okay, okay. Change the
show however you want!

02:35.349 --> 02:37.583
Make it exactly like the
other crap on your network,

02:37.708 --> 02:39.616
but just let me stay!

02:39.741 --> 02:41.118
Just don't fire me.

02:42.150 --> 02:43.537
Now that's groveling.

02:44.446 --> 02:46.582
Time to try out my new deep fryer.

02:46.750 --> 02:49.585
- Who wants fresh doughnuts?
- Me! Me! Me-me-me!

02:49.833 --> 02:52.129
And I even got rainbow sprinkles.

02:52.485 --> 02:54.563
Some rainbow...
there's no violet.

02:54.688 --> 02:56.934
- Then don't have any.
- Hey, don't listen to me!

02:57.059 --> 02:58.678
What do I know about rainbows?

03:00.120 --> 03:02.478
None for me, Marge.
I get free doughnuts at work.

03:02.603 --> 03:03.719
I can see them now.

03:03.844 --> 03:05.795
In the break room,
beside the fridge,

03:05.920 --> 03:07.645
the pink cardboard box awaits.

03:07.889 --> 03:10.940
Groaning with a
"United Nations" of doughnuts:

03:11.065 --> 03:13.553
jellies rubbing elbows
with cream-filled,

03:13.678 --> 03:16.456
the masculine contours
of the box juxtaposed

03:16.581 --> 03:19.210
with the feminine curves
of the treats themselves.

03:20.359 --> 03:23.244
- Why didn't you try to stop him?
- I did, once.

03:26.832 --> 03:27.790
No pink box?

03:28.068 --> 03:29.297
What's going on?

03:29.524 --> 03:32.128
I'm afraid your daily
doughnuts are no more.

03:32.481 --> 03:34.213
You. Can't. Do. That.

03:34.381 --> 03:36.404
Until Mr. Roosevelt's
New Deal starts working,

03:36.529 --> 03:39.639
this country's still in a depression.
I'm spending a fortune on atoms,

03:39.764 --> 03:41.095
and we have to cut costs.

03:41.263 --> 03:44.223
But we have way more expensive
unnecessaries than doughnuts.

03:44.391 --> 03:46.162
Yeah, like the ceiling furniture.

03:46.287 --> 03:48.435
Or all the joke ID badges we order.

03:48.603 --> 03:50.304
- No doughnuts!
- No!

03:50.429 --> 03:51.564
- D'oh!
- Nuts!

03:51.824 --> 03:52.829
Exactly.

03:56.743 --> 03:58.528
But seriously, hey, hey, kids.

03:58.697 --> 04:00.154
A word about today's show.

04:00.279 --> 04:02.523
The network "geniuses"

04:02.648 --> 04:04.952
with the ink still drying
on their MBAs...

04:06.955 --> 04:09.965
...think your old pal Krusty
should share his limelight

04:10.090 --> 04:12.318
with an up-and-coming new star.

04:12.443 --> 04:14.408
Let's give a respectful welcome

04:14.533 --> 04:16.562
to Princess Penelope.

04:22.961 --> 04:27.052
<i>Where do I keep my princess-ness? </i>

04:27.365 --> 04:31.437
<i>It's not in my jewels or my crown</i>

04:32.194 --> 04:36.797
<i>It's not in the smiles
of my handmaids three</i>

04:37.086 --> 04:38.944
<i>Who hold up the train</i>

04:39.373 --> 04:41.447
<i>Of my gown</i>

04:41.615 --> 04:46.989
<i>It's the part of me that wants to be</i>

04:47.414 --> 04:52.784
<i>The girl whom everyone flatters</i>

04:59.660 --> 05:01.704
<i>'Cause in her heart</i>

05:01.829 --> 05:03.802
<i>A princess knows</i>

05:04.070 --> 05:09.052
<i>She's the only girl who matters</i>

05:13.105 --> 05:15.168
I can't keep watching this dreck.

05:17.734 --> 05:18.890
Much better.

05:19.015 --> 05:21.257
First, girls ruined
<i>Sex and the City.</i>

05:21.382 --> 05:22.404
Now this.

05:22.572 --> 05:25.324
I agree it's clichÃ©,
but she does have a certain...

05:26.160 --> 05:27.284
Unicorn!

05:31.286 --> 05:32.665
That is so fake.

05:32.833 --> 05:35.751
- You can see the strap on the horn.
- Just give me this!

05:37.848 --> 05:39.298
Easy there, Habitrail.

05:39.423 --> 05:41.048
They took away
our doughnuts at work.

05:41.173 --> 05:42.722
All I've had are my meals.

05:42.847 --> 05:45.135
And the worst thing is,
there's nothing we can do about it.

05:45.260 --> 05:47.560
I think that's the best thing
'cause then you can say,

05:47.685 --> 05:49.598
"Well, there's nothing
we can do about it."

05:49.766 --> 05:52.351
Bartender, buy these men
a round on me.

05:52.546 --> 05:54.270
You want to "buy a round?"

05:54.438 --> 05:56.299
I heard about that
in bartending school,

05:56.424 --> 05:57.904
but I never seen it happen.

05:58.391 --> 06:00.181
Oh, this is very good for me.

06:00.306 --> 06:01.527
Very good indeed.

06:01.806 --> 06:03.856
Gator McCall.
I'm a headhunter.

06:06.189 --> 06:09.637
I'm a corporate recruiter
who specializes in nuclear workers.

06:10.258 --> 06:13.407
I guess these days,
headhunters can be anything.

06:13.532 --> 06:16.375
You nuclear workers have no
idea how valuable you are.

06:16.543 --> 06:18.420
Times have never been
better for your industry,

06:18.545 --> 06:20.453
now that all the protesters
who marched in front

06:20.578 --> 06:23.507
of nuclear power plants are
dying off from radiation poisoning.

06:23.756 --> 06:25.759
Are these business cards or...

06:25.927 --> 06:27.720
passports to a better future?

06:27.888 --> 06:29.858
- Those are business cards.
- Nice.

06:31.375 --> 06:33.151
Krusty, thanks to Princess Penelope,

06:33.276 --> 06:34.847
your studio audience is packed.

06:34.972 --> 06:37.235
And we didn't need
any cardboard kids.

06:37.968 --> 06:40.024
Yeah, but they're all girls.

06:40.192 --> 06:42.529
Girls don't laugh,
and they don't buy cigars.

06:42.654 --> 06:45.237
Dutch Masters is gonna
drop us like a hot potato.

06:46.256 --> 06:48.573
Hey, hey, kids!
Let's see what's in the news.

06:48.698 --> 06:51.744
I see we reached a soft
timber agreement with Canada.

06:52.101 --> 06:53.985
We want the Princess!

06:54.110 --> 06:55.372
Don't forget the unicorn!

06:56.226 --> 06:59.335
Did I hear the sound
of wishes being wished?

07:02.705 --> 07:06.175
<i>Glitter and sparkle, one, two, three</i>

07:06.343 --> 07:10.596
<i>You're all princesses just like me.</i>

07:14.559 --> 07:17.090
Breathin' all
this stuff can't be good.

07:17.938 --> 07:18.823
Poor Krusty.

07:18.948 --> 07:21.357
He's become the lowest
form of life: a sidekick.

07:21.525 --> 07:22.739
You said it, Bart.

07:22.864 --> 07:26.001
- Way to sum up the situation.
- Take it easy, little buddy.

07:26.126 --> 07:28.186
That's exactly how I'll take it.

07:31.428 --> 07:33.443
Do you want to come in
and get your sister with me?

07:33.568 --> 07:34.522
Hell, no.

07:34.647 --> 07:36.546
Watch your language.
Now, why the hell not?

07:36.671 --> 07:38.557
The Krusty Show sucks now.

07:38.682 --> 07:40.786
It's all pink and princessy.

07:40.911 --> 07:42.949
Why are great things
always ruined by women?

07:43.074 --> 07:44.890
The Army, the Fantastic Four.

07:45.015 --> 07:48.039
Think how awesome American Idol
would be with just Simon and Randy.

07:49.671 --> 07:51.599
Oh, Bart, you say that now.

07:51.724 --> 07:54.247
But when you're grown up,
you'll just think it.

07:54.372 --> 07:56.320
Now you stay here
and I'll get your sister.

07:57.791 --> 08:00.565
Princess Penelope,
sign mine, sign mine!

08:07.232 --> 08:08.385
What the...?!

08:10.646 --> 08:14.214
- Where's all your Krusty stuff?
- Right through that magical door.

08:17.654 --> 08:18.880
Ay carumba!

08:25.750 --> 08:26.567
Krusty?

08:28.338 --> 08:30.603
Snap out of it!
You're Krusty the Clown.

08:30.728 --> 08:34.163
One of Look magazine's hundred
most-promising clowns of 1958.

08:34.660 --> 08:36.801
A lot of suicides in that group.

08:37.003 --> 08:39.049
Funny suicides,...

08:39.393 --> 08:41.844
...but still.
My day is over, kid.

08:42.011 --> 08:44.780
What are you talking about?
Whose name is on that sign?

08:51.457 --> 08:53.564
Hey, how'd this one
get way over here?

08:57.172 --> 08:59.241
That's it. I've hit rock-bottom.

08:59.366 --> 09:01.681
Well, my comeback starts now.

09:02.273 --> 09:03.574
I mean, now.

09:05.347 --> 09:07.551
Let me start by getting out
of the Dumpster.

09:08.027 --> 09:11.665
Oh, why do clown things
always happen to clowns?

09:17.393 --> 09:20.070
Now other nuclear plants
let their employees

09:20.195 --> 09:23.197
tape Gary Larson cartoons
on their workstations.

09:23.322 --> 09:26.472
But here at Cap City Nuclear,
you can actually see...

09:26.640 --> 09:27.595
Gary Larson.

09:28.711 --> 09:31.268
Gary Larson?!
I thought you retired.

09:31.393 --> 09:34.607
I was retired until I got the call
from Capital City Nuclear,

09:34.732 --> 09:38.025
offering me the chance to be the
in-house cartoonist at a nuclear plant.

09:38.188 --> 09:41.292
Gary, why don't you whip up
an instant classic for my friends here?

09:41.417 --> 09:42.759
You got it, Gator.

09:47.048 --> 09:50.663
Man, a lion would not want
to see that on his X-ray.

09:53.451 --> 09:55.000
Where are you?
Where?

09:55.168 --> 09:58.584
You're not even in Nassau County
anymore. You're in Suffolk.

09:58.709 --> 10:01.263
Look, look, no.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

10:01.388 --> 10:03.309
You're going the wrong way.
Hold on.

10:03.634 --> 10:05.099
Coming!

10:05.276 --> 10:07.481
Now see here,
Little Miss Scene Stealer,

10:07.606 --> 10:09.212
I'm the star of this show.

10:09.337 --> 10:11.267
You're just the reason
people tune in.

10:11.435 --> 10:13.682
Krusty, there's something
I have to tell you.

10:13.807 --> 10:15.304
No, no! Let me finish:

10:15.429 --> 10:17.514
I work like I drink: alone.

10:17.639 --> 10:19.161
Or with a monkey watching me.

10:19.461 --> 10:21.360
Krusty... I love you.

10:21.528 --> 10:24.613
That way, if I pass out,
he turns me on my side so....

10:24.738 --> 10:25.698
You what?!

10:26.009 --> 10:29.640
I have loved you since
I was a 12-year-old girl,

10:29.765 --> 10:32.268
in Mineola, Long Island,
watching your show.

10:32.393 --> 10:34.034
WDQT?

10:34.159 --> 10:36.792
They had this fat,
pathetic station manager.

10:36.960 --> 10:38.586
- That was my father.
- Great guy.

10:38.754 --> 10:41.547
I still have my Krusty Klub ring.

10:41.888 --> 10:44.972
I wasn't popular because
I was more beautiful

10:45.097 --> 10:48.637
and friendly than everyone else,
but whenever I looked at this ring,

10:49.034 --> 10:51.621
I knew I had one friend.

10:52.030 --> 10:54.477
You know those rings came
with a membership card.

10:56.216 --> 10:57.313
That's the one.

10:59.361 --> 11:00.326
Oh, my God.

11:00.451 --> 11:03.402
Please don't tell me I died
on the operating table again.

11:03.570 --> 11:06.492
You didn't.
This is real, Krusty.

11:15.091 --> 11:18.060
Welcome to the Krusty
and Princess Penelope

11:18.185 --> 11:20.570
Smoochie-Poo I Love You Hour.

11:20.695 --> 11:23.208
No laughs, just hugs a cuddles.

11:23.376 --> 11:24.343
Don't worry.

11:24.468 --> 11:26.211
Mr. Teeny's t a flaming arrow.

11:31.523 --> 11:32.885
Oh, yuck.

11:39.337 --> 11:41.226
<i>This old clown, tee-hee-hee</i>

11:41.646 --> 11:43.395
<i>He's as happy as can be</i>

11:43.684 --> 11:46.065
<i>'Cause I got a girlfriend under 33...</i>

11:48.346 --> 11:50.652
I walked 19 miles for this?

11:51.043 --> 11:53.620
<i>Can't you kids be glad for me?</i>

11:55.909 --> 11:58.346
<i>I am her, she is me</i>

11:58.471 --> 12:00.746
<i>I'm just like Penelope...</i>

12:02.909 --> 12:05.234
<i>It's still on in my head</i>

12:05.359 --> 12:07.783
<i>It will be there till I'm dead...</i>

12:11.841 --> 12:14.249
Whether she was competing
in equestrian events

12:14.374 --> 12:18.480
at the 1976 Olympics or spending
her summers at Holyrood Palace,

12:18.605 --> 12:21.266
Princess Anne is truly
a world leader.

12:25.158 --> 12:28.007
Okay, so far, for
"Inspirational Women Day"

12:28.132 --> 12:30.526
we've had one Princess Anne,
15 Dias,

12:30.694 --> 12:33.514
two baby Princess Ingrid
Alexandras of Norway,

12:33.639 --> 12:35.030
and one Princess Leia.

12:35.198 --> 12:37.074
I'm a Star Wars.

12:42.455 --> 12:46.250
I dot care what anyone says.
Massages are relaxing.

12:46.877 --> 12:49.394
Now if you boys sign up
with Cap City Nuclear,

12:49.519 --> 12:51.088
you'll get weekly massages,

12:51.349 --> 12:54.117
plus free sushi right
through the face hole.

13:00.026 --> 13:01.807
Sir, I have some unsettling news:

13:01.975 --> 13:03.790
three of our workers
are being poached.

13:03.915 --> 13:05.535
The heart of our tug-of-war team.

13:05.660 --> 13:08.285
No. No, this is our year.
How can this be happening?

13:08.410 --> 13:10.682
Sir, I'm afraid your
doughnut-cutting measures,

13:10.807 --> 13:13.277
***whe reasable,
were perceived as draconian.

13:13.499 --> 13:16.313
Comparing me to old Draco, eh?

13:16.727 --> 13:18.680
I'll have to do
something about this.

13:29.315 --> 13:32.421
<i>I was a parched little seedling</i>

13:32.913 --> 13:36.665
<i>Until you were watered with love</i>

13:36.867 --> 13:42.777
<i>Love, love, love, love, love.</i>

13:44.727 --> 13:46.351
Stop the music!

13:46.519 --> 13:47.686
Thank God.

13:47.854 --> 13:50.347
I'm sick and tired of this woman...

13:50.472 --> 13:53.008
- Yes!
- ...not being married to me.

13:54.110 --> 13:57.988
Penelope, will you be
my princess bride?

13:59.525 --> 14:02.675
Krusty, yes! Yes!

14:04.996 --> 14:06.626
That's it. Game over.

14:06.751 --> 14:09.161
Is it, Bart? Is it?

14:09.446 --> 14:10.834
What are you talking about?

14:11.002 --> 14:13.566
A wedding is a complex thing, Bart.

14:13.691 --> 14:16.569
It's so easy for something
to go wrong.

14:17.213 --> 14:20.403
Milhouse Van Houten,
will you do me the honor

14:20.528 --> 14:22.652
of ruining Krusty's wedding with me?

14:22.777 --> 14:25.811
Oh, Bart,
this is all happening so fast.

14:25.936 --> 14:27.804
Let's call my mom together.

14:32.557 --> 14:34.147
Good-bye, power plant.

14:34.272 --> 14:37.256
I'd better get out of here before
I have a meltdown.

14:38.365 --> 14:41.633
If I hadn't had to work in you,
we might've been friends.

14:41.961 --> 14:43.070
So long.

14:46.780 --> 14:47.918
Oh, right.

14:54.142 --> 14:55.079
Gentlemen.

14:56.714 --> 14:59.823
- Please don't leave me.
- Sir, I'm afraid it's too late.

14:59.948 --> 15:03.913
Oh, I imagine Cap City's been
wooing you with trips to the seashore,

15:04.038 --> 15:07.800
a Christmas goose, Spanish lemons,
folderol I can't afford to match.

15:07.968 --> 15:11.721
But please, accept this
little going-away present.

15:12.507 --> 15:15.725
You can't win us back
with mere doughnuts.

15:16.103 --> 15:18.505
Oh, but these aren't
just any doughnuts.

15:18.630 --> 15:21.484
These doughnuts were made
the old-fashioned way:

15:21.609 --> 15:23.904
the dough is sweetened
with Cuban sugar

15:24.029 --> 15:25.735
from pre-Batista plantations,

15:26.186 --> 15:29.927
then it's deep-fried in the tallow
of three different animals,

15:30.261 --> 15:32.408
two of which are now extinct.

15:40.257 --> 15:44.128
That is the most amazing
doughnut I've ever tasted.

15:44.636 --> 15:47.319
Well, if youtay on at the
Springfield Nuclear Plant,

15:47.444 --> 15:49.935
you could have one
of these tasty beauties every day.

15:52.371 --> 15:54.198
One of these every day
might kill us.

15:54.323 --> 15:56.085
Can we get a health plan
to go with them?

15:56.210 --> 15:57.767
Sure, you can have a health plan...

15:57.892 --> 16:00.102
or two doughnuts a day.

16:03.273 --> 16:05.094
Move over, Brangelina.

16:05.219 --> 16:07.537
Take a back seat, Queen Latifarod.

16:07.662 --> 16:10.553
Because today belongs
to "Krustelope."

16:10.678 --> 16:12.616
This is the 15th marriage
for Krusty,

16:12.741 --> 16:14.551
and the first
for "Princess Penelope,"

16:14.676 --> 16:16.464
who is not, in fact,
a real princess.

16:16.589 --> 16:17.827
Her actual name is:

16:17.952 --> 16:22.291
Penelope Mountbatten Hapsburg
Hohenzollern Mulan-Pocahontas.

16:37.087 --> 16:39.072
Well, let's do the ceremony.

16:44.418 --> 16:47.573
Friends, loved ones,
we are gathered here today

16:47.698 --> 16:49.692
to marry a Jew and a...

16:50.579 --> 16:53.471
Congregationalist...
is that even a thing?

16:53.496 --> 16:56.308
And now, let's continue
with this mockery.

16:58.907 --> 17:01.509
- You're not my ringbearer.
- What happened to the monkey?

17:01.634 --> 17:03.271
I locked him in the Torah room.

17:06.194 --> 17:07.721
Kid, what's your angle?

17:07.846 --> 17:09.986
I'm trying to seal
the deal over here.

17:10.111 --> 17:13.534
Princess, before you marry Krusty,
there's someone you should meet.

17:13.702 --> 17:15.166
Holly Hippie.

17:15.291 --> 17:18.724
Krusty's sidekick in 1969
and his first wife.

17:18.849 --> 17:21.125
He wouldn't let me
watch the moon landing.

17:21.292 --> 17:24.047
I was jealous of Neil Armstrong.

17:24.172 --> 17:25.971
And his last wife, Eartha Kitt,

17:26.096 --> 17:28.089
recorded this before
her untimely death.

17:28.258 --> 17:30.541
They were only married
for six hours,

17:30.666 --> 17:32.405
but she still hated Krusty.

17:32.530 --> 17:35.156
He was asleep
for five of those hours.

17:35.281 --> 17:38.540
And the one he was awake,
was a cat-tastrophe.

17:40.995 --> 17:42.807
This is such an eye-opener.

17:43.315 --> 17:47.332
I am blown away by how
little this bothers me.

17:47.457 --> 17:49.039
I really love this guy.

17:49.164 --> 17:52.947
And you are the greatest thing
that's ever happened to me.

17:54.034 --> 17:56.622
**d that's why I can't marry you.

17:56.747 --> 17:59.217
This kid
and his ugly sister are right.

17:59.342 --> 18:00.873
I won't be good enough for ya.

18:01.130 --> 18:03.771
You can never disappoint me.

18:03.896 --> 18:06.491
I know your past...
your mug shots,

18:06.616 --> 18:10.557
your bowling alley shoe spray
addiction, your country album.

18:10.682 --> 18:13.636
- They don't bother me.
- They don't?

18:13.804 --> 18:15.054
Don't you love me?

18:19.979 --> 18:22.910
Princess, you're the only woman
I care about enough

18:23.035 --> 18:24.730
to ditch at the altar.

18:25.290 --> 18:26.315
Okay, Krusty,

18:26.747 --> 18:28.413
if that's how you feel.

18:28.538 --> 18:31.570
We'll always have
Sideshow Mel's dressing room.

18:31.738 --> 18:33.572
What?!

18:44.505 --> 18:48.134
<i>We're after</i>

18:48.259 --> 18:54.051
<i>the same rainbow's end</i>

18:55.558 --> 18:59.376
<i>Waiting 'round the bend</i>

18:59.931 --> 19:04.061
<i>My huckleberry friend</i>

19:05.611 --> 19:11.320
<i>Moon river</i>

19:12.928 --> 19:17.533
<i>And me...</i>

19:49.433 --> 19:52.109
- Just my imagination.
- No, it wasn't.

19:52.277 --> 19:54.941
I came here looking for you,
and I fell off the boat.

19:57.431 --> 20:00.256
Krusty!
My Borscht Belt baby!

20:03.226 --> 20:05.100
You changed your mind.

20:05.225 --> 20:09.603
Ah, I'd rather be a happy
schnook than a noble shlumpf.
