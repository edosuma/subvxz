00:01.086 --> 00:02.379
<i>Previously on Riverdale...</i>

00:02.587 --> 00:04.798
You only have enough
in the bank to cover
three more weeks of payroll.

00:05.006 --> 00:06.633
I'm waiting to hear
on this huge bid.

00:06.841 --> 00:08.885
That new development
where the old drive-in
used to be?

00:09.344 --> 00:10.512
<i>I kissed Fred Andrews.</i>

00:10.720 --> 00:12.931
The other thing.
It involves you
forging my signature

00:13.139 --> 00:16.059
to get Fred Andrews
that stupid contract
to build on Dad's land.

00:16.559 --> 00:20.313
You hated Jason,
and now Polly is pregnant
with his baby.

00:20.522 --> 00:23.066
Of course you can stay.
Anything for
Alice Cooper's daughters.

00:23.483 --> 00:25.735
- So where are you
gonna live now?
- I'll figure it out, Dad.

00:26.444 --> 00:29.322
He was stealing
from the company
and selling stuff on the side.

00:29.531 --> 00:30.740
<i>When someone is drowning,</i>

00:30.949 --> 00:33.868
<i>you can try to save them,
but not if they're gonna
drag you down with them.</i>

00:41.960 --> 00:43.169
<i>The Coopers.</i>

00:43.878 --> 00:45.255
<i>The Stepfords of Riverdale.</i>

00:46.756 --> 00:48.550
<i>High school sweethearts
who got married</i>

00:48.758 --> 00:51.845
<i>and had two beautiful
daughters, Polly and Betty...</i>

00:54.389 --> 00:56.224
<i>Until Jason Blossom happened.</i>

00:57.475 --> 01:01.396
<i>And now, we would hear from
the person who was closest
to him those days</i>

01:01.604 --> 01:03.189
<i>leading up to
his disappearance...</i>

01:04.232 --> 01:05.567
<i>Polly Cooper.</i>

01:05.775 --> 01:10.530
<i>How a casual conversation
turned into an epic,
forbidden romance.</i>

01:10.739 --> 01:15.410
<i>How, for reasons still murky,
their respective parents
tried to tear them apart.</i>

01:15.618 --> 01:17.579
<i>How their break-up
was short-lived,</i>

01:17.787 --> 01:20.957
<i>because Polly soon learned
she was pregnant
with Jason's baby.</i>

01:23.043 --> 01:25.378
<i>How they became
secretly engaged</i>

01:25.587 --> 01:28.381
<i>with his
grandmother's blessing
and her heirloom ring,</i>

01:30.341 --> 01:32.135
<i>and made plans
to run away together,</i>

01:33.511 --> 01:35.138
<i>to start a new life.</i>

01:35.680 --> 01:39.100
<i>And how their dreams of escape
went up in flames.</i>

01:42.645 --> 01:43.938
That was the last day
you saw him?

01:44.147 --> 01:46.357
At Pop's, when
he told me the plan,

01:46.566 --> 01:47.776
that he was gonna fake
his own death,

01:47.984 --> 01:49.194
and then we would meet up.

01:49.402 --> 01:52.697
But, before that could happen,
my mom and dad sent me away.

01:53.448 --> 01:56.743
One of Jason's teammates said
that before he ran away,

01:56.951 --> 01:58.495
Jason was dealing drugs.

01:58.703 --> 02:00.747
Making a one-time delivery.

02:00.955 --> 02:03.875
He needed... We needed money.

02:04.084 --> 02:05.668
To get away and to start over.

02:05.877 --> 02:09.005
So Riverdale's star football
player becomes a drug mule?

02:09.214 --> 02:10.799
He went to a bar on the
other side of the tracks

02:11.007 --> 02:13.468
and made a deal
with some biker gang.

02:13.676 --> 02:14.636
The Serpents?

02:14.844 --> 02:17.097
He got an address upstate,

02:17.305 --> 02:20.058
where he was supposed
to deliver the drugs
in exchange for cash.

02:20.225 --> 02:21.935
The drugs you found
in Jason's car...

02:23.311 --> 02:25.105
- Yeah.
- ...that went up in flames.

02:25.313 --> 02:27.649
Along with everything
I had left of Jason,

02:27.857 --> 02:29.776
including the ring
his nana gave me,

02:30.401 --> 02:32.695
which he was
keeping until...

02:33.947 --> 02:36.825
Okay, Sheriff, I think
that's enough for tonight.

02:37.033 --> 02:38.451
I think Polly needs her rest.

02:39.285 --> 02:41.162
I'll be in touch, ladies.

02:41.371 --> 02:42.914
- I'll show you out.
- Thank you.

02:46.167 --> 02:47.544
We're gonna get you
through this, okay?

02:57.929 --> 03:00.306
Gotta stop
blowing me up.
- You're going the wrong way.

03:00.515 --> 03:02.600
- You're going the...
- What are you doing?

03:02.809 --> 03:04.352
Come on.

03:04.561 --> 03:06.354
You're the one
who keeps accidentally
killing me.

03:06.563 --> 03:07.981
War is hell, Jug.

03:09.107 --> 03:11.818
No, Archie,
hell is other people.

03:12.026 --> 03:13.778
Hey, guys,
getting pretty late...

03:13.987 --> 03:15.780
And... Whoa!
It's kinda ripe in here.

03:15.989 --> 03:16.948
Does someone wanna
open a window?

03:17.157 --> 03:17.866
I got it.

03:19.450 --> 03:21.703
- You settling in, Jug?
- Oh, completely.

03:21.870 --> 03:24.664
It's like Archie and I are
just roommates
in a college dorm.

03:24.873 --> 03:26.875
Oh, great. What does
that make me, the RA?

03:27.083 --> 03:28.293
No, you're the third roommate.

03:29.752 --> 03:31.462
All right, guys.
I got a big day tomorrow.

03:31.671 --> 03:33.631
Yeah, breaking ground
on the SoDale project, right?

03:33.840 --> 03:35.466
Yeah. Indeed, we are.

03:36.759 --> 03:38.720
Sorry, 'cause I know
it's kind of a sore spot
with you, Jughead,

03:38.928 --> 03:40.096
about the drive-in.

03:40.305 --> 03:42.807
As long as you build something
beautiful in its place.

03:43.016 --> 03:45.852
Well, I don't know
about beautiful,
but it's gonna be big.

03:47.061 --> 03:48.521
- Night, guys.
- Night, Dad.

03:55.195 --> 03:56.905
<i>♪ Talking television
at the... ♪</i>

03:57.113 --> 03:59.908
Polly's convinced herself
that no one wants her baby.

04:00.116 --> 04:03.161
Besides, of course,
the child-snatching
Blossom monsters.

04:03.578 --> 04:05.955
- No offense, Cheryl.
- None taken.

04:06.164 --> 04:08.082
So your mom and dad want
Polly but not the baby,

04:08.291 --> 04:10.418
and the Blossoms want
the baby and not Polly.

04:11.544 --> 04:13.463
That's a true Gordian knot.

04:13.671 --> 04:16.299
It's an impossible situation.

04:16.507 --> 04:17.717
Betty, come on.

04:17.926 --> 04:19.886
An impossible situation
is being invited

04:20.094 --> 04:21.846
to both the <i>Vanity Flair</i>
Oscar party

04:22.055 --> 04:24.140
and Elton John's Oscar party
on the same night.

04:24.349 --> 04:26.601
Which happened to me
one year, I know.

04:26.809 --> 04:29.395
This is merely
an annoying situation.

04:29.604 --> 04:33.107
But luckily, I've been
percolating on an idea,

04:33.316 --> 04:35.235
hellishly simple
in its conception.

04:35.985 --> 04:38.655
What if my mom and I were
to host a baby shower?

04:38.863 --> 04:39.739
Count me in.

04:39.948 --> 04:42.450
You want Polly to feel loved
and supported, right?

04:42.659 --> 04:45.495
Yeah, but ideally
by her own parents.

04:45.703 --> 04:47.997
Okay, so, baby steps, girl.

04:48.206 --> 04:50.667
Get Polly and your parents
in the same room

04:50.875 --> 04:52.627
in a public setting
where they can't fight,

04:52.835 --> 04:54.921
and, <i>voila,</i>
let the healing begin.

04:55.129 --> 04:56.464
Am I expected to
come to this thing?

04:56.673 --> 04:57.382
Of course!

04:57.590 --> 04:58.925
You're Betty's
boyfriend, so...

05:00.593 --> 05:02.470
Oh, my God, you guys, relax.

05:02.679 --> 05:04.555
It's just a word that starts
with the letter "B."

05:06.516 --> 05:07.934
Betty, what do you say?

05:09.852 --> 05:10.812
Elizabeth Cooper.

05:11.020 --> 05:12.021
Mom?

05:12.230 --> 05:13.648
I need you and you.

05:15.483 --> 05:16.442
Right now.

05:20.655 --> 05:23.741
Hey, Vic, I was just getting
ready to come out and walk
you through the day.

05:25.952 --> 05:29.330
Hate to do this to you,
Fred, but, um...
I gotta pull my crew.

05:31.249 --> 05:33.584
Before we've even started?
What happened?

05:33.793 --> 05:35.086
Cliff Blossom reached out.

05:35.295 --> 05:36.754
Says he's got
a big job coming up.

05:36.963 --> 05:37.964
Says he needs us
free and available.

05:39.716 --> 05:42.802
Blossom's willing to guarantee
us two years' work,
starting now.

05:43.011 --> 05:44.554
Can't ask my guys to turn
down that kind of money.

05:44.762 --> 05:46.014
No, Vic, I can't.

05:46.222 --> 05:47.307
Sorry, Fred.

05:52.937 --> 05:54.856
Sheriff Keller
told us everything.

05:55.315 --> 05:57.191
How you're hiding Polly
at the Pembrooke?

05:57.400 --> 05:59.527
Better than
in an insane asylum.

05:59.736 --> 06:01.821
Actually,
Mrs. Cooper, that's on me.

06:02.030 --> 06:04.365
I was the one who suggested
that Polly stay with us.

06:04.574 --> 06:06.117
She's trying to help.

06:06.326 --> 06:09.329
Unlike you and Dad,
who want Polly to give
the baby up for adoption.

06:09.537 --> 06:12.373
Betty, it's what's best
for Polly and the baby.

06:12.582 --> 06:14.417
Mom, that's not your choice.

06:14.625 --> 06:17.670
Your choice is whether
or not you want to be
a part of Polly's life.

06:20.423 --> 06:23.134
Veronica and her mom
have offered to host
a baby shower.

06:23.343 --> 06:24.969
Well, that is
hardly appropriate!

06:25.553 --> 06:26.512
Really?

06:27.513 --> 06:29.932
Because I think
it's an amazing idea.

06:31.142 --> 06:33.936
You want to be
loving and supportive
like a normal grandmother?

06:34.145 --> 06:35.438
Then, great.

06:35.646 --> 06:38.441
Otherwise, stay away.

06:43.946 --> 06:47.283
Don, I just need a few guys
from your crew.

06:47.492 --> 06:49.911
A couple to
get me started.

06:50.119 --> 06:52.914
I did check.
I'll get back to you, Don.

06:56.250 --> 06:57.752
What was that about?

06:57.960 --> 06:59.337
It's all good.

06:59.545 --> 07:01.089
How was your date with Val?

07:01.297 --> 07:03.549
It was good.
I got you some slices.

07:07.345 --> 07:08.888
Did something happen at work?

07:09.639 --> 07:15.186
Cliff Blossom made my crew
an offer they couldn't refuse
so they walked.

07:15.395 --> 07:16.771
Every last one of 'em.

07:17.605 --> 07:18.731
Screw em, then.

07:18.940 --> 07:21.692
Anyone who'd rather work
for Clifford Blossom
than you is crazy, Dad.

07:26.322 --> 07:26.989
Dad?

07:27.740 --> 07:28.825
What is it?

07:29.700 --> 07:31.828
You always make me talk
to you about my problems.

07:34.705 --> 07:37.708
The business...
It's in trouble, Archie.

07:38.459 --> 07:39.961
Has been for a long time.

07:40.169 --> 07:43.047
Big jobs are just
few and far between.

07:43.256 --> 07:45.133
That's why this SoDale thing
is so important to me.

07:47.009 --> 07:48.344
I can't break ground
without a crew,

07:48.553 --> 07:51.139
so every day
I'm just hemorrhaging cash.

07:51.347 --> 07:55.017
We've got equipment
sitting there, supplies,
bills that are past due.

07:55.226 --> 07:58.146
Dad, why didn't you tell me?
I had no idea.

07:58.729 --> 08:01.065
It was never
supposed to get this bad.

08:02.358 --> 08:03.985
You work your ass off
to build something,

08:04.193 --> 08:06.863
and in one false step
you could lose everything.

08:07.071 --> 08:08.739
No, Dad, you're not
losing anything.

08:10.283 --> 08:11.492
We'll figure this out.

08:24.213 --> 08:26.632
A baby shower? Are you sure
that's a good idea? You know--

08:26.841 --> 08:28.217
- It is.
- It's a great idea.

08:28.426 --> 08:29.385
What about Mom and Dad?

08:29.844 --> 08:32.430
What do you want, honey?
Do you want them to come?

08:32.638 --> 08:34.724
I do. I mean, Mom, at least.

08:34.932 --> 08:37.435
In that case, we'll get
her there somehow.

08:37.643 --> 08:39.061
But I do not want
to fight with her.

08:39.270 --> 08:40.229
You won't.

08:40.438 --> 08:43.065
The entire Cooper family will
support you on this, Polly.

08:43.274 --> 08:45.193
I want the Blossoms there.

08:45.401 --> 08:47.487
- Cheryl, sure, yeah,
she's on the guest list.
- Cheryl.

08:47.695 --> 08:49.030
And Mrs. Blossom.

08:49.238 --> 08:51.782
She just tried to declare
you an unfit mother.

08:51.991 --> 08:54.577
Well, then this shower
is the perfect opportunity

08:54.785 --> 08:56.329
for me to prove
to her that I'm not.

08:57.955 --> 09:00.124
- Ronnie? A word?
- Hmm?

09:00.333 --> 09:01.709
Sure.

09:01.918 --> 09:02.710
Excuse us.

09:10.551 --> 09:13.513
The Blossoms
and the Coopers in our
pre-war apartment?

09:13.721 --> 09:15.139
It'll be a bloodbath!

09:15.348 --> 09:16.682
They've been the Hatfields
and the McCoys

09:16.891 --> 09:18.768
since long before Polly
was pregnant.

09:18.976 --> 09:21.312
Plus, I'm trying
to avoid the Blossoms.

09:21.521 --> 09:22.855
If they find out
your father is the one

09:23.064 --> 09:24.315
who bought the drive-in,

09:24.524 --> 09:25.650
it'll be open war.

09:25.858 --> 09:26.692
Against us?

09:26.901 --> 09:28.319
They're making a play
for the land,

09:28.528 --> 09:30.363
hoping to stop construction.

09:30.571 --> 09:32.657
Fred and I are trying
to keep it on track, but...

09:32.865 --> 09:35.243
But Mr. Andrews still doesn't
know that Daddy is the buyer?

09:35.451 --> 09:38.496
All of which is to say
the timing of this shower
is just...

09:38.704 --> 09:40.540
It's not ideal.

09:40.748 --> 09:42.416
Plus, I can't believe
Alice even wants to come,

09:42.625 --> 09:43.501
from what you've told me.

09:43.709 --> 09:44.585
She doesn't.

09:44.794 --> 09:47.672
I was kind of hoping you might
talk some sense into her?

09:47.880 --> 09:49.674
You know, like,
mother-to-mother?

09:49.882 --> 09:51.175
Oh, yeah, no.

09:51.384 --> 09:53.427
Please, Mom,
she really needs our help.

10:06.816 --> 10:07.650
Fred.

10:08.526 --> 10:11.654
You try to hire my crew on
the first day of construction?

10:11.862 --> 10:13.447
Opportunity knocks
when it knocks.

10:13.656 --> 10:14.699
Nothing personal.

10:14.907 --> 10:16.117
Yeah, it never is
with you guys.

10:16.325 --> 10:17.535
So what is it?
The development? What?

10:17.743 --> 10:19.996
That land you're building on,
it belonged to my family.

10:20.580 --> 10:22.623
We founded our
maple empire on it.

10:23.374 --> 10:24.875
Now, we were in the process
of trying to reacquire it,

10:25.084 --> 10:26.210
buy it back,

10:26.419 --> 10:27.837
when your mysterious boss,

10:28.045 --> 10:30.715
he, he just stole it right out
from underneath us.

10:30.923 --> 10:32.800
And you can't go after him,
so you come after me.

10:33.009 --> 10:36.637
The way your boss does
business deals, secret deals,

10:36.846 --> 10:39.515
building that
SoDale monstrosity

10:39.724 --> 10:40.933
at the speed of light

10:41.142 --> 10:44.562
kinda makes me think that he
has a limited amount of funds.

10:45.271 --> 10:46.897
So you're gonna
halt construction,

10:47.607 --> 10:48.232
bleed him out.

10:48.441 --> 10:50.234
Reacquire the land
at a more reasonable rate.

10:51.569 --> 10:53.279
- That's a great plan.
- Thank you.

10:53.487 --> 10:55.948
Except you're bleeding me out,
too, you pompous ass.

10:57.575 --> 10:59.493
You're messing
with my business,

10:59.702 --> 11:02.997
my livelihood,
my son's future.

11:03.831 --> 11:05.958
I don't care if you're
the richest man in Riverdale.

11:06.167 --> 11:08.711
I will come after you
with everything I've got.

11:08.919 --> 11:10.171
Which is what, exactly?

11:14.216 --> 11:15.426
Go park somewhere else.

11:24.560 --> 11:25.895
How did it go with Clifford?

11:26.103 --> 11:28.397
Good, insofar as I
didn't knock him on his ass,

11:28.606 --> 11:30.441
which I would
really love to do.

11:33.152 --> 11:35.321
He's in some kind of
grudge match with
the owner of this land.

11:35.529 --> 11:36.989
Lucky us, we're caught
in the crossfire.

11:39.992 --> 11:42.828
And this mysterious buyer...

11:43.454 --> 11:44.997
Does Cliff know who he is?

11:45.206 --> 11:47.041
No, he's as
in the dark as we are.

11:49.543 --> 11:51.087
What the hell now?

11:59.720 --> 12:00.971
What is this?

12:01.180 --> 12:03.974
Your new crew,
reporting for duty.

12:04.600 --> 12:07.186
I appreciate it, I do,
but isn't there
something more important

12:07.395 --> 12:08.646
you need to be doing?

12:08.854 --> 12:10.189
Like going to school,
playing football?

12:10.398 --> 12:12.441
We can work after practice
and on weekends.

12:12.650 --> 12:14.944
Until you find a new crew.
Help keep things on schedule.

12:15.945 --> 12:18.572
Come on, Dad. I worked
for you the whole summer.

12:18.781 --> 12:21.325
- And these guys...
- We're bruiser studs,
Mr. Andrews.

12:21.534 --> 12:22.451
At least some of us are.

12:24.036 --> 12:25.788
Come on.
Desperate times, Fred, huh?

12:29.667 --> 12:30.876
All right. Here we go.

12:31.877 --> 12:35.798
<i>♪ Life gives me
one more chance ♪</i>

12:36.006 --> 12:38.134
You must be
loving this, Hermione.

12:38.342 --> 12:40.428
Providing sanctuary
to my daughter.

12:41.846 --> 12:44.306
Asking me here, to what?
Gloat?

12:46.100 --> 12:48.602
Look, I asked you here
because I'm trying to help.

12:49.103 --> 12:50.855
So what is your plan
for Polly?

12:51.897 --> 12:53.274
What do you want?

12:53.482 --> 12:54.984
I want my daughter back.

12:55.776 --> 12:57.611
I want my family
back together.

12:58.320 --> 13:00.322
Well, then,
it's time to face facts.

13:01.657 --> 13:04.243
Hermione, Polly is a teenager.

13:04.452 --> 13:06.746
She hasn't even
finished high school.

13:07.163 --> 13:09.707
The father of her baby
has been murdered.

13:09.915 --> 13:13.002
You want to play house
with her, and throw her
a baby shower, fine.

13:13.210 --> 13:16.380
But the very next day,
all of those things
will still be true.

13:16.839 --> 13:18.174
And she's supposed to what?

13:19.383 --> 13:20.551
Raise a child?

13:20.760 --> 13:22.553
Mothers do it every day.

13:23.763 --> 13:24.722
We did it.

13:26.557 --> 13:27.808
Come to the shower.

13:28.017 --> 13:30.060
Be there for Polly. Help her.

13:32.062 --> 13:34.815
Otherwise,
you're gonna regret it
for the rest of your life.

13:40.571 --> 13:41.363
This is awesome.

13:41.572 --> 13:43.741
Moving rocks beats working out
in our crappy weight room.

13:43.949 --> 13:45.075
Hey, Keller!

13:45.493 --> 13:47.495
Looking good, looking buff.

13:47.703 --> 13:48.871
We should get you on the team.

13:49.455 --> 13:52.541
I prefer my contact sports
one-on-one, you know, like...

13:53.209 --> 13:53.959
Boxing.

13:58.172 --> 14:00.341
Pretty handy with
that wheelbarrow, Archie.

14:00.549 --> 14:02.176
You know, if the whole music
thing doesn't pan out,

14:02.384 --> 14:04.762
you can always have
manual labor as a fallback.

14:04.970 --> 14:07.431
Don't even joke.
I did this all summer long,
remember?

14:07.640 --> 14:09.099
My dad loves
this kind of work.

14:09.308 --> 14:10.643
And I love him, but...

14:10.851 --> 14:11.811
No, I know.

14:12.019 --> 14:13.604
Your dad's path
is not for you.

14:13.813 --> 14:15.272
Trust me, I get it.

14:15.981 --> 14:17.900
He works his ass off
for me, bro,

14:18.108 --> 14:19.318
but never asks for anything.

14:19.527 --> 14:21.695
Always has my back,
even when I mess up.

14:21.904 --> 14:24.990
So if having his back means
I gotta haul some rocks,
then bring it on.

14:25.199 --> 14:25.950
Agreed.

14:26.158 --> 14:27.493
Your dad's got my back, too.

14:28.536 --> 14:29.495
More than some people.

14:30.162 --> 14:31.247
Exactly.

14:34.583 --> 14:36.210
Hey, guys, you were
a life-saver today.

14:36.418 --> 14:38.045
I appreciate it.
Hard hats go in the bin,

14:38.254 --> 14:39.880
and there's sodas
in the fridge.

14:40.756 --> 14:42.174
Crap! Hey, guys,
I forgot my phone.

14:52.434 --> 14:53.811
Hey!

14:55.312 --> 14:56.647
Hey, get away from there!

15:18.252 --> 15:20.004
Moose, are you okay?

15:20.212 --> 15:21.547
Stay down.
We'll get you some help.

15:21.755 --> 15:23.757
- Who did this to you, Moose?
- No clue.

15:24.592 --> 15:26.677
But they said,
as long as we keep working,

15:27.219 --> 15:28.554
they're gonna keep
coming back.

15:48.866 --> 15:50.117
What the hell happened?

15:50.951 --> 15:54.872
Moose, over there, he caught
a couple of guys working over
my equipment with a crowbar

15:55.080 --> 15:57.041
and then they got
the drop on him.

15:57.249 --> 15:58.500
Who were they, vandals?

15:58.709 --> 16:00.294
Cliff Blossom has made it
abundantly clear

16:00.502 --> 16:01.587
he would love nothing more

16:01.795 --> 16:03.172
than to see this whole project
go belly-up.

16:03.380 --> 16:05.174
I doubt that Blossom's
gonna hire some thugs

16:05.382 --> 16:07.593
to bust up your site
and beat up some teenagers.

16:08.761 --> 16:10.054
Maybe it wasn't him.

16:10.679 --> 16:12.723
I mean, this is
Serpent territory, right?

16:12.932 --> 16:15.809
Maybe it was them.
Pissed that they had to leave
'cause of this project.

16:16.185 --> 16:17.478
- Serpents?
- Yeah.

16:17.645 --> 16:20.189
When I worked at the drive-in,
the Serpents never bugged me.

16:22.608 --> 16:24.902
Did you see any snake tattoos,
anything on their jackets?

16:25.110 --> 16:26.403
It happened pretty fast.

16:27.154 --> 16:28.989
All right,
I'll talk to Blossom,
but I mean

16:29.198 --> 16:31.367
I don't think we'll
get anywhere unless
we can ID these guys.

16:31.909 --> 16:32.952
That is such bull.

16:33.160 --> 16:35.162
If this was Clifford Blossom
asking for help,
you would say yes.

16:35.371 --> 16:37.039
- Archie.
- What, Dad? It's true.

16:37.247 --> 16:38.415
It's also not helping.

16:43.671 --> 16:46.131
Have you heard from Mom?
Is she coming?

16:48.258 --> 16:50.427
She's invited.

16:52.972 --> 16:54.515
Hey, it doesn't matter.

16:55.265 --> 16:58.602
If Mom doesn't want to come,
that's on her. It's her loss.

16:58.811 --> 17:02.481
Betty, I've decided...
I want you to be
the baby's godmother.

17:03.315 --> 17:05.150
Really? Me?

17:05.359 --> 17:06.402
Oh, my God!

17:06.610 --> 17:07.736
If anything would ever
happen to me,

17:07.945 --> 17:10.614
the only person I'd trust to
take care of my baby is you.

17:11.991 --> 17:13.867
Oh, my God, Pol!

17:19.456 --> 17:21.333
It's so wrong, Val!

17:21.542 --> 17:22.793
Things should not be this way.

17:23.002 --> 17:25.546
It sucks, but, please, Archie,
talk to me.

17:25.754 --> 17:28.007
I can't keep talking about it,
I have to do something.

17:28.507 --> 17:30.217
Hopefully not something
you'll regret.

17:33.053 --> 17:34.638
I'm sorry, Val, I have to go,
I have to try.

17:37.057 --> 17:39.059
<i>Poor Moose.
Is he okay?</i>

17:39.560 --> 17:41.854
His name is Moose. He's fine.

17:42.938 --> 17:45.733
Dude, what the hell?
I've been texting you.

17:45.941 --> 17:48.444
Archie, Jughead just told us
what happened yesterday.

17:48.652 --> 17:51.363
Though I checked out
at the words
"construction" and "site."

17:51.572 --> 17:54.408
Moose and I are going
to the Southside to find
those Serpents. You in?

17:54.616 --> 17:57.661
Whoa! Hey, you didn't say
it was the Serpents
who beat Moose up.

17:57.870 --> 17:59.455
'Cause we don't
know that for a fact.

17:59.663 --> 18:01.874
Well, it's still worth a shot
if it might help my dad.

18:02.583 --> 18:04.001
Kevin's boyfriend
can get us in.

18:04.209 --> 18:05.377
Get you in where?

18:05.586 --> 18:07.254
To some bar
where the Serpents hang out.

18:08.505 --> 18:10.424
If Moose spots them,
we call Sheriff Keller

18:10.632 --> 18:11.800
and get these goons arrested.

18:12.009 --> 18:15.429
Archie, the Serpents
are dangerous.

18:15.637 --> 18:16.889
They're drug-dealers.

18:17.097 --> 18:17.931
What?

18:18.682 --> 18:19.516
Says who?

18:20.768 --> 18:21.852
Polly.

18:22.061 --> 18:24.897
Remember? Trev told us
that Jason was dealing drugs?

18:25.105 --> 18:26.565
It was for the Serpents.

18:26.774 --> 18:28.692
You heard my Dad, Jughead.

18:28.901 --> 18:31.195
Clifford Blossom is
trying to torpedo him.

18:31.403 --> 18:33.614
Sheriff Keller basically blew
him off, right in front of us.

18:33.822 --> 18:35.866
Somebody needs
to do something.

18:37.493 --> 18:40.120
Archie, going into that bar
is a bad idea.

18:40.329 --> 18:43.040
Jughead, are you coming
with me or not?

18:47.628 --> 18:48.921
Thanks for having my back.

19:01.767 --> 19:03.560
Play it cool,
just like we said.

19:04.061 --> 19:05.562
Keep eye-contact to a minimum.

19:06.146 --> 19:08.315
And Moose, if you see the guys
that jumped you, we leave,

19:08.524 --> 19:09.983
and we call Kevin's dad.

19:25.874 --> 19:27.126
Moose? Anything?

19:27.334 --> 19:28.710
Not yet, not that I see.

19:28.919 --> 19:30.295
We're all gonna die.

19:35.175 --> 19:36.260
Pay up.

19:36.468 --> 19:38.137
I'm gonna get
this back, right?

19:38.345 --> 19:39.721
You wish, Preppy.

19:45.352 --> 19:46.270
Is that one of them?

19:46.770 --> 19:47.646
I can't tell.

19:48.272 --> 19:49.314
He looks kind of familiar.

19:51.817 --> 19:52.985
Oh, God!

19:53.610 --> 19:54.236
Hey.

19:56.446 --> 19:58.782
What? You got a death wish?

19:58.991 --> 19:59.950
Archie, back off.

20:00.159 --> 20:00.993
What the hell is this?

20:01.201 --> 20:02.578
You like beating up teenagers?

20:03.120 --> 20:05.372
This isn't the first time
one of you Bulldogs
has come in here,

20:05.581 --> 20:06.832
looking to 'cause trouble.

20:10.419 --> 20:13.755
Hey! That's enough,
Mustang. Let 'em go.

20:20.846 --> 20:22.181
I'll take care of this.

20:37.946 --> 20:39.865
Not you, Red, you stay.

20:42.284 --> 20:43.076
I'm good.

20:47.539 --> 20:48.790
What the hell are
you doing here?

20:48.999 --> 20:51.793
Looking for the thugs that
trashed my dad's equipment.

20:52.002 --> 20:54.588
We figured it was
the Serpents, angry for
getting kicked off their land,

20:54.796 --> 20:55.964
but now that I know
you're a Serpent,

20:56.173 --> 20:57.758
I'm thinking this is personal.

20:57.925 --> 21:00.052
Going after my dad,
his company,

21:00.260 --> 21:01.803
that is payback, right?
For when he fired you?

21:02.012 --> 21:04.097
Man, you've got a bigger
imagination than Jughead,

21:04.306 --> 21:05.098
and that's saying something.

21:05.307 --> 21:07.226
This isn't a joke.
My dad could lose everything.

21:07.434 --> 21:08.977
You think I'm responsible?

21:09.186 --> 21:12.105
That I've been, what, waiting
all these years for a chance
to get back at your old man?

21:12.314 --> 21:15.609
No. No, kid, life's too short.

21:16.276 --> 21:18.695
You don't know that now,
but you will.

21:22.783 --> 21:25.369
I called him the second
you set foot in the bar.

21:28.789 --> 21:29.831
Get in the truck, Archie.

21:31.875 --> 21:33.794
<i>♪ Our house, our house</i>

Right this way.

21:44.096 --> 21:46.348
- Hey. Hey.
- Good to see you.

21:48.850 --> 21:51.311

21:56.858 --> 21:59.236
I know this isn't
exactly your scene.

21:59.444 --> 22:02.447
What? Organizing
a baby shower?

22:02.656 --> 22:04.241
It's totally on
my bucket list.

I'm so glad you're here,
and you're safe.

22:29.308 --> 22:30.475
You and the baby.

22:31.351 --> 22:32.311
Oh, Mom.

22:36.106 --> 22:37.316
We're here!

22:40.652 --> 22:43.530
No big deal, it's only the
best stroller money can buy.

22:43.739 --> 22:45.532
So expensive.

22:45.741 --> 22:47.909
All I ask in return is
that you make me
your baby's godmother.

22:50.245 --> 22:51.455
Kidding!

22:51.663 --> 22:52.748
So not kidding.

22:54.333 --> 22:56.710
Come on, Nana Rose,
let's get you a good spot
by the food.

22:59.087 --> 23:00.047
Polly.

23:01.173 --> 23:03.175
Let me begin with an apology.

23:03.383 --> 23:06.178
When I first heard about
the baby, my initial instinct,

23:06.386 --> 23:10.766
to embrace the baby
but not you was wrong.

23:12.267 --> 23:14.061
I hope you can forgive me.

23:14.269 --> 23:16.938
Think happy thoughts.

23:22.736 --> 23:24.571
So what, you're a Serpent now?

23:24.738 --> 23:26.073
Thought you left that behind.

23:26.281 --> 23:27.908
A guy's got to make a living.

23:28.075 --> 23:30.494
- And not many people
would hire me, after...
- Right.

23:30.702 --> 23:32.120
It's my fault you run
with criminals

23:32.329 --> 23:33.789
that rough up teenagers
and trash my equipment?

23:33.997 --> 23:35.832
You really think
I'd come after you?

23:36.041 --> 23:39.294
That I'd put you and your kid
in danger after everything
you've done for my boy?

23:40.879 --> 23:42.089
Look, I'm

23:43.256 --> 23:45.258
sorry for your troubles.

23:46.510 --> 23:47.761
How bad is it?

23:48.470 --> 23:50.555
I got no crew. I got no cash.

23:51.890 --> 23:53.016
Never been worse.

23:53.809 --> 23:55.268
Let me ask around.

23:55.769 --> 23:58.438
See if any of my guys have
heard who it could be.

23:59.773 --> 24:01.274
I'd appreciate it.

24:02.317 --> 24:05.112
You'll pull through, Fred.
You always do.

24:05.320 --> 24:07.572
But you might wanna keep tabs
on that boy of yours.

24:14.704 --> 24:17.958
This necklace
reads the baby's aura.

24:18.125 --> 24:19.793
Predicts the sex.

24:20.001 --> 24:21.920
Nana has dementia
and gypsy blood.

24:23.171 --> 24:25.173
- Oh!
- What?

24:25.382 --> 24:26.508
Is my baby okay?

24:27.551 --> 24:28.760
Babies.

24:29.636 --> 24:31.388
It's twins.

24:31.596 --> 24:33.306
One of each!

24:33.515 --> 24:36.184
This is occultism
at its most ludicrous.

24:36.852 --> 24:38.478
But I'm grateful to be here.

24:40.272 --> 24:42.482
Oh! Thanks guys!

24:44.484 --> 24:45.527
Okay, now Mom's.

24:56.288 --> 24:59.082
It's my nightlight.
When I was a little kid.

25:00.375 --> 25:01.960
How did you...
Where did you even...

25:02.169 --> 25:05.505
I saved it. I know how much
you loved it and
how it made you feel safe.

25:05.714 --> 25:08.008
And I wanted you to be able
to pass it down to your
own baby one day.

25:08.175 --> 25:09.301
Alice, it's lovely.

25:13.180 --> 25:14.473
Open ours next, dear.

25:22.522 --> 25:24.441
You were protecting him.
That's why you didn't tell me.

25:24.649 --> 25:25.525
Relax.

25:25.734 --> 25:26.818
What happened?

25:27.611 --> 25:29.571
Did you know that
Jughead's father is a Serpent?

25:30.864 --> 25:31.490
No.

25:32.908 --> 25:35.410
That's why he tried to stop me
from going to the bar,
so I wouldn't find out.

25:35.619 --> 25:37.204
After everything
my dad has done for you...

25:37.412 --> 25:39.706
Archie. I can explain, okay?

25:39.915 --> 25:40.832
But not right now.

25:41.041 --> 25:43.668
This is Polly's day, so you
two need to check yourselves.

25:43.877 --> 25:44.794
I mean it.

25:44.961 --> 25:46.463
- Archie...
- No, save it.

25:47.631 --> 25:48.340
Come on.

25:49.591 --> 25:52.761
That is
a family heirloom.

25:53.428 --> 25:57.599
Great-grandfather Blossom
used to play with it.
Isn't it magnificent?

25:57.807 --> 25:59.935
Oh, Polly, come stay with us
at Thornhill.

26:01.102 --> 26:04.314
Cheryl's invitation
is genuine.

26:05.023 --> 26:07.734
Thornhill's gates will
always be open to you.

26:08.193 --> 26:09.861
The child would
want for nothing.

26:10.070 --> 26:11.988
You would want for nothing.

26:13.240 --> 26:18.036
Do you think that you can just
waltz in here, with a
bedbug-infested Trojan Horse,

26:18.245 --> 26:21.081
wave a blank check around
and steal my daughter?

26:21.289 --> 26:22.874
I didn't think you wanted her,

26:23.083 --> 26:26.753
else why would she have
been exiled like some pariah?

26:27.170 --> 26:29.005
To keep her away
from your family.

26:29.673 --> 26:31.424
Oh...

26:31.591 --> 26:34.135
And not because
you're ashamed?

26:34.803 --> 26:37.931
Why is your own daughter
not living with you?

26:38.139 --> 26:41.101
She's not going to
set foot in that twisted,

26:41.309 --> 26:42.936
poisonous house of yours.

26:43.144 --> 26:44.354
She should be so lucky.

26:44.563 --> 26:46.356
Cheryl, that's not helping.

26:46.815 --> 26:48.900
She'd do a lot better there
than with you.

26:49.109 --> 26:50.193
How dare you?

26:50.402 --> 26:52.737
Enough! Both of you!

26:52.946 --> 26:53.989
If you believe one lie...

26:54.197 --> 26:56.283
This is why
Jason is dead!

26:56.491 --> 27:00.120
Because of this hate.
This pointless,
stupid fighting.

27:00.328 --> 27:01.746
- Honey...
- No, don't touch me.

27:02.247 --> 27:03.748
We were supposed
to be together.

27:05.292 --> 27:07.460
And you didn't let us
have that, neither of you.

27:08.753 --> 27:10.589
And you know
it cost Jason his life.

27:11.506 --> 27:12.549
Polly.

27:27.230 --> 27:28.189
Mom.

27:29.691 --> 27:31.026
You need to talk to her.

27:39.951 --> 27:42.078
Polly, I'm sorry.

27:42.287 --> 27:44.372
- It's just that woman...
- Didn't send me away.

27:46.541 --> 27:47.167
You did.

27:50.462 --> 27:53.214
And if you hadn't, I would've
met up with Jason,

27:53.423 --> 27:55.050
and he still might be alive.

27:55.759 --> 27:58.803
Or you might've gotten
hurt or worse.

27:59.721 --> 28:01.389
I was alone there.

28:02.265 --> 28:03.683
In that place.

28:03.892 --> 28:08.021
I never wanted you to feel
alone, or unwanted,

28:08.438 --> 28:09.731
or unloved.

28:12.651 --> 28:14.944
Honey, come home.

28:15.403 --> 28:17.656
I promise you you'll never
feel that way again.

28:20.241 --> 28:21.910
You want me to come home?

28:22.118 --> 28:23.870
More than anything, honey.

28:24.621 --> 28:25.914
Yeah, but what about Dad?

28:27.332 --> 28:27.999
Your father...

28:28.208 --> 28:30.377
Dad's just gonna
have to get over it.

28:30.752 --> 28:33.880
Are you sure he's not just
gonna try and make another
appointment for me?

28:34.547 --> 28:36.508
What are you talking about?
What appointment?

28:37.425 --> 28:41.054
Before you sent me away,
Dad made an appointment
for me to see a doctor.

28:41.971 --> 28:45.016
Said he would be more
than happy to pay for it.

28:45.809 --> 28:47.977
That I shouldn't have
to live with my mistake.

28:48.603 --> 28:50.021
Oh, my God...

28:50.689 --> 28:52.691
He didn't even ask me
what I wanted.

29:12.460 --> 29:14.295
Dad, before you say anything,
I was trying to help.

29:14.504 --> 29:16.589
- It was reckless.
- Yeah, but it doesn't matter.

29:16.756 --> 29:18.591
I wanna pull my
weight around here.

29:18.800 --> 29:20.760
I wanna help you
the way you help me.

29:20.969 --> 29:22.554
We've both done
everything we can.

29:26.141 --> 29:27.642
I need you to know, son...

29:29.436 --> 29:32.647
I tried, my whole life,
to build stuff.

29:33.231 --> 29:35.650
I tried to build a family,
that didn't work out.

29:35.859 --> 29:41.197
I'm trying to build us
a safe life for you.

29:41.406 --> 29:43.616
And the jury's
still out on that.

29:46.911 --> 29:49.748
I've been pouring concrete
and laying brick

29:50.039 --> 29:51.249
since I was your age.

29:54.169 --> 29:55.587
That's who I am.

29:57.756 --> 29:59.132
It's all I am.

30:03.011 --> 30:04.387
Dad, I was thinking,

30:09.100 --> 30:11.644
what if I have a kid someday,

30:12.937 --> 30:14.856
and what if that kid
hates music,

30:15.064 --> 30:16.232
doesn't want anything
to do with it,

30:17.609 --> 30:19.444
and says, instead...

30:19.652 --> 30:23.364
"Nah, I wanna build houses
and buildings like Grandpa."

30:23.573 --> 30:26.075
I think that would be
pretty friggin' cool, Dad.

30:28.495 --> 30:29.788
That would be something.

30:33.082 --> 30:37.378
This is your legacy,
which makes it mine, too.

30:50.141 --> 30:51.935
Polly's finally asleep.

30:54.229 --> 30:55.688
What a mess.

31:00.068 --> 31:02.237
I should've told you about
my dad when I had the chance.

31:04.823 --> 31:06.115
So, why didn't you?

31:07.242 --> 31:08.743
I was ashamed.

31:10.829 --> 31:11.871
Jughead,

31:12.956 --> 31:14.499
if we're gonna be together,

31:15.625 --> 31:17.377
I want to know who you are.

31:18.336 --> 31:19.379
All of it.

31:21.422 --> 31:22.090
Okay.

31:24.259 --> 31:25.009
Okay.

31:26.761 --> 31:29.138
But Juggy, we should
talk to your dad.

31:31.224 --> 31:34.143
He might know
something about Jason.

31:46.447 --> 31:47.782
Jughead!

31:47.991 --> 31:50.076
Dad, Betty Cooper.

31:50.243 --> 31:51.578
Betty, this is my dad.

31:51.786 --> 31:53.621
Hi, Mr. Jones,
nice to meet you, officially.

31:53.830 --> 31:55.748
And you, and you. Um...

31:55.957 --> 31:57.625
Why don't you guys sit down?

31:59.043 --> 32:02.130
This isn't really
a social call.

32:02.338 --> 32:05.800
No. I didn't expect
it would be after Archie
showed up at the bar.

32:06.009 --> 32:08.011
We know the Serpents
had some kind of drug thing

32:08.219 --> 32:09.596
going on with Jason Blossom.

32:09.804 --> 32:11.180
What?

32:11.848 --> 32:13.016
Where'd you hear that?

32:13.224 --> 32:15.101
- Jason's girlfriend.
- My sister.

32:24.152 --> 32:27.530
The kid needed some
money to get away.

32:28.823 --> 32:31.242
A clean-cut kid like that,
no one's gonna suspect
him of running,

32:31.451 --> 32:33.620
so we helped him,
he helped us.

32:33.828 --> 32:35.538
Jeez, Dad.
Did you tell the cops that?

32:35.747 --> 32:37.123
What do you think?

32:38.374 --> 32:40.877
Well, they know now.
Polly told them.

32:41.419 --> 32:43.463
So if they haven't been
by yet, they will be.

32:44.255 --> 32:46.758
Did you ever talk to Jason?
Personally?

32:46.966 --> 32:48.718
My guys gave him some product.

32:48.927 --> 32:53.139
When it wasn't delivered,
we figured he'd took off
with our stash, until...

32:53.348 --> 32:56.059
Until Jason's body was
found at Sweetwater River.

33:03.524 --> 33:04.901
Anything else you wanna ask?

33:07.695 --> 33:10.073
Did you have
anything to do with
Jason Blossom's death?

33:13.743 --> 33:15.536
You really think
I could do that?

33:16.037 --> 33:17.789
It's the dark ages, Dad.

33:17.997 --> 33:20.500
I don't really know
what to think anymore.

33:22.043 --> 33:24.462
I'm not a perfect father,
Jughead, no getting
around that,

33:24.671 --> 33:28.424
but... I'm no killer.

33:42.605 --> 33:45.483
- Do you believe him?
- I do.

33:48.736 --> 33:49.696
Do you?

33:52.156 --> 33:53.866
I believe you, Jughead.

34:21.227 --> 34:21.853
Honey?

34:22.061 --> 34:25.106
What did you say to Polly
when you found out that
she was pregnant?

34:25.314 --> 34:27.066
Did you make an
appointment for her?

34:28.443 --> 34:29.610
With a doctor?

34:30.361 --> 34:32.655
That you offered to pay for?

34:33.072 --> 34:34.574
Behind my back?

34:35.533 --> 34:39.203
So that she could fix her...
Her mistake?

34:41.998 --> 34:42.623
Alice.

34:43.374 --> 34:44.042
Bastard!

34:49.630 --> 34:54.343
So you did to Polly exactly
what you did to me?

34:54.886 --> 34:59.640
See, this is why
I didn't involve you,
for this very reason.

34:59.849 --> 35:01.434
I knew that you
would overreact.

35:02.810 --> 35:05.980
Honey, you
weren't ready, okay?

35:06.189 --> 35:07.523
And neither is Polly.

35:07.732 --> 35:10.485
We were sending
her to the Sisters.

35:11.027 --> 35:12.403
Why wasn't that enough?

35:12.820 --> 35:15.782
Because of exactly
what is happening right now.

35:16.532 --> 35:19.577
Our little girl's life
is being ruined

35:20.411 --> 35:21.621
by that mistake.

35:22.038 --> 35:25.249
By that family.

35:25.458 --> 35:29.253
Polly is moving home, into
this house, where she belongs.

35:29.462 --> 35:30.797
The hell she is, Alice!

35:32.715 --> 35:34.509
'Cause I will not be party

35:34.717 --> 35:36.010
to raising a child

35:36.219 --> 35:38.596
that has Blossom blood.

35:41.015 --> 35:42.058
Get out.

35:42.266 --> 35:43.184
No.

35:46.479 --> 35:49.107
Get out!

35:49.315 --> 35:50.525
Get out!

35:50.733 --> 35:54.070
Get out before I do something
that we both regret.

35:55.696 --> 35:59.200
And I think, by now, you know
what I'm capable of.

35:59.408 --> 36:02.036
No. What would people think?

36:05.206 --> 36:07.834
I don't...
I don't care anymore.

36:08.042 --> 36:10.336
And I am not gonna ask again.

36:12.338 --> 36:13.172
Get out.

36:15.341 --> 36:17.969
I don't want you here
when Polly gets home.

36:53.045 --> 36:54.380
I should've trusted you.

36:55.047 --> 36:56.716
There's no excuse.

36:57.884 --> 37:00.761
I was afraid that
the Serpents and my dad

37:00.970 --> 37:02.805
were the ones doing
those messed up things.

37:04.432 --> 37:06.225
I didn't wanna
believe that was true.

37:08.102 --> 37:11.480
I mean...
He's my dad, Archie.

37:12.773 --> 37:14.817
I get that. I do.

37:16.777 --> 37:19.280
But, Jughead, you can talk
to me about anything.

37:20.281 --> 37:21.115
You're like...

37:24.285 --> 37:25.703
You're like my brother.

37:27.955 --> 37:29.540
Nice bro-whisper, Archie.

37:31.876 --> 37:32.877
You are my brother.

37:34.462 --> 37:36.255
And I'm here for you
and your dad.

37:36.464 --> 37:37.381
So what can I do?

37:39.508 --> 37:40.718
Pray for a miracle.

37:45.723 --> 37:48.351
The heat is on.
If the cops come around...

37:50.853 --> 37:52.396
This is our insurance.

37:52.605 --> 37:54.273
In case everything
goes to hell.

37:55.024 --> 37:57.944
Here, stash it. Keep it safe.

38:01.155 --> 38:02.990
How's it going
with the Keller kid?

38:03.616 --> 38:05.409
It's good.
He thinks we're legit.

38:05.618 --> 38:06.494
Right on.

38:06.702 --> 38:08.704
We're gonna need that
inside line with the Sheriff.

38:12.792 --> 38:13.709
What?

38:13.918 --> 38:15.086
We got a problem?

38:16.504 --> 38:18.172
He likes me, you know...
For real.

38:25.012 --> 38:26.514
Ah, you're breaking my heart.

38:28.015 --> 38:29.642
We all got a part to play.

38:31.060 --> 38:32.270
Including me.

38:38.818 --> 38:41.070
I've got calls into Greendale
and Centerville.

38:41.279 --> 38:43.739
Clifford Blossom couldn't have
hired every crew in the state.

38:44.240 --> 38:46.867
In the meantime, we'll
just be a two-person crew.

38:47.076 --> 38:48.577
That won't be necessary.

38:50.037 --> 38:51.580
You need a crew?

38:51.789 --> 38:53.958
My guys are always
looking for work.

38:54.917 --> 38:57.044
And you've never had
a better foreman than me.

39:00.256 --> 39:02.008
I won't leave you
hanging this time.

39:03.384 --> 39:04.677
What if there's trouble?

39:06.762 --> 39:08.723
We can handle trouble.

39:12.184 --> 39:13.352
We're burning daylight.

39:14.437 --> 39:15.354
Let's get going.

39:15.563 --> 39:18.107
I'll catch up.
We're just gonna
get the paperwork done.

39:21.652 --> 39:25.072
I asked around about
those bruisers going
after your man's crew.

39:25.281 --> 39:27.033
Turns out they weren't local.

39:28.409 --> 39:30.286
Why are you telling me,
not Fred?

39:30.786 --> 39:33.914
One of my guys says
he knows 'em from a stint
doing time up north,

39:34.123 --> 39:35.416
in Montreal.

39:38.252 --> 39:41.130
Pretty sure we both know
who has business in Montreal.

39:42.089 --> 39:43.841
Hiram? But...

39:44.050 --> 39:45.051
Why would he...

39:45.259 --> 39:47.762
Maybe he got a whiff
of your little romance
with Freddy Andrews?

39:48.637 --> 39:52.350
But the real question is,
who ratted you out?

39:57.772 --> 40:00.149
Mom had no idea, Polly.

40:00.524 --> 40:02.777
Dad never told her.
She swears it.

40:04.153 --> 40:05.696
I just...

40:05.905 --> 40:07.615
I can't believe
she kicked him out.

40:07.823 --> 40:09.241
She meant what she said.

40:09.867 --> 40:15.331
She wants you and the baby,
or babies, to feel safe.

40:16.415 --> 40:17.458
Which means...

40:19.001 --> 40:20.294
You can come home now.

41:02.002 --> 41:03.295
I'm sorry, Mom.

41:06.924 --> 41:08.300
I tried.

41:30.364 --> 41:32.741
Polly, we're so happy
you're here.

41:34.076 --> 41:35.453
I'm doing this for my baby.

41:36.036 --> 41:37.079
Of course.

41:37.288 --> 41:38.414
You made the right choice.

41:38.956 --> 41:40.166
You'll be safe here.
