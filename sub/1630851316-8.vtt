WEBVTT

00:21.630 --> 00:22.935
Uhp! Okay!

00:23.066 --> 00:24.024
Okay, okay!

00:24.154 --> 00:25.286
Hold your fire!

00:25.416 --> 00:26.852
Hold your fire.

00:29.855 --> 00:31.031
Hey. Ned.

00:31.161 --> 00:33.163
Go reset that mannequin.

00:34.425 --> 00:35.992
Why?
They're just gonna fall again.

00:36.123 --> 00:37.994
And then you'll
pick it up again.

00:38.125 --> 00:39.517
That's how this works.

00:39.648 --> 00:41.650
Okay, why not keep 'em
on the ground, then, Dad?

00:41.780 --> 00:43.521
They're still targets,
whether they're standing or not.

00:43.652 --> 00:45.132
For the hundredth time, boy,

00:45.262 --> 00:46.698
you don't shoot someone
that's laying down.

00:46.829 --> 00:48.048
It's against nature.

00:48.178 --> 00:49.310
Fine. Okay.

00:49.440 --> 00:50.441
Whatever.

00:50.572 --> 00:52.182
Okay.

00:52.313 --> 00:53.575
Today.

00:53.705 --> 00:55.707
"Against nature."

00:55.838 --> 00:58.319
Yeah,
your face is against nature.

00:58.449 --> 01:00.190
This place is a damn junkyard.

01:00.321 --> 01:03.541
I am so out of here, I swear.

01:10.200 --> 01:11.810
How many mannequins

01:11.941 --> 01:13.508
are trying to get
out of this place?

01:16.772 --> 01:18.252
What the hell?

01:18.382 --> 01:22.169
Dad. Dad! Come here, quick!

01:54.418 --> 01:56.159
It is so nice not to have to eat

01:56.290 --> 01:57.726
on the run for a change.

01:57.856 --> 01:59.815
Yeah, rare.

01:59.945 --> 02:01.817
If I got to eat another
sandwich in a car...

02:01.947 --> 02:03.688
Or over a dead body.

02:04.733 --> 02:06.822
What about you over there--
another bento box?

02:06.952 --> 02:08.215
Oh, you bento betcha.

02:08.345 --> 02:10.782
Got some hummus, chicken,

02:10.913 --> 02:12.828
a little tabbouleh.

02:12.958 --> 02:14.612
Oh, yeah, and look,
you got each item

02:14.743 --> 02:16.527
in its own very little, uh,
compartment there.

02:16.658 --> 02:18.442
Okay. Go ahead and say it.

02:18.573 --> 02:19.791
I'm not saying a word.

02:19.922 --> 02:20.966
Uh, I'll say it.

02:21.097 --> 02:22.142
Even her lunch

02:22.272 --> 02:24.535
likes its personal space.

02:24.666 --> 02:26.102
And there it is.

02:26.233 --> 02:27.930
There goes Kasie the gym rat.

02:28.060 --> 02:30.585
Uh, with the lab report
you requested,

02:30.715 --> 02:32.152
and I will be back
in about an hour.

02:32.282 --> 02:33.501
So, uh, how many weeks
in a row is that, now?

02:33.631 --> 02:35.459
Mm, about nine.
But, uh, you know,

02:35.590 --> 02:37.331
...who's counting?

02:37.461 --> 02:39.289
Hey, I could use
a training partner.

02:39.420 --> 02:40.638
If you're ready, let me know.

02:40.769 --> 02:42.597
Ready for you, Nick?

02:42.727 --> 02:44.164
Never. No.

02:44.294 --> 02:46.166
Plus, my gym
is women's only,

02:46.296 --> 02:48.080
so unless you want
to work out in drag...

02:48.211 --> 02:50.126
Don't dare me.
I'll do it, man.

02:50.257 --> 02:51.475
You keep doing
what you're doing, girl.

02:51.606 --> 02:52.563
Looks good on you.

02:52.694 --> 02:54.130
Feels good. Thanks.

02:54.261 --> 02:55.740
You enjoy your bento
any which way you like.

02:55.871 --> 02:57.829
Leave her lunch alone, boys.

02:57.960 --> 02:59.527
For the record, Nick,
I would pay a lot

02:59.657 --> 03:00.919
to see you work out in drag.

03:01.050 --> 03:03.966
Mm. Says more about you
than it does me.

03:04.096 --> 03:05.533
Good for
Kasie, huh?

03:05.663 --> 03:07.404
I mean, talk about
an extra spring in her step.

03:07.535 --> 03:08.884
Seriously. Good for her.

03:09.014 --> 03:11.452
And good for us.
Enjoying our lunch together.

03:11.582 --> 03:13.541
Too bad
we'll have to take it to go.

03:13.671 --> 03:15.586
Somehow I knew that was coming.

03:15.717 --> 03:17.849
- Where to?
- Outdoor shooting range,

03:17.980 --> 03:20.243
Falls Church--
got a dead Navy reservist.

03:20.374 --> 03:23.681
Well, "bento to go"
has a good ring to it.

03:23.812 --> 03:25.117
You heard Kasie.

03:25.248 --> 03:26.510
Lay off my lunch.

03:30.035 --> 03:32.777
Our victim is
Lieutenant Victor Bateson.

03:32.908 --> 03:34.866
Former active duty,
now a reservist.

03:34.997 --> 03:37.391
Should I bother asking
cause of death, Jimmy?

03:37.521 --> 03:39.088
Obvious call would be
a gunshot wound,

03:39.219 --> 03:41.133
but I can't even begin
to count all of them.

03:41.264 --> 03:43.701
Be easier to tell you
where he wasn't shot.

03:43.832 --> 03:45.529
Hey, guys.

03:46.574 --> 03:48.619
Victor Bateson. Ring any bells?

03:48.750 --> 03:50.142
Not a one. And no idea

03:50.273 --> 03:51.753
how in the hell
he got in there, either.

03:51.883 --> 03:54.451
- What about the car?
- What about it?

03:54.582 --> 03:55.496
How long has it been here?

03:55.626 --> 03:57.411
Uh, this one, about a week.

03:57.541 --> 03:58.760
So, for a whole week

03:58.890 --> 04:00.805
you've been using
this nice old car

04:00.936 --> 04:02.764
as target practice?

04:02.894 --> 04:04.331
It's a old junker.

04:04.461 --> 04:06.985
But it wasn't always,
now, was it?

04:08.073 --> 04:10.119
You got any security cameras,
Mr. Gorton?

04:10.250 --> 04:11.425
Nope.
Pretty old-school here.

04:11.555 --> 04:13.122
Yeah, I had a feeling.

04:13.253 --> 04:14.776
But I can guarantee
that that guy was

04:14.906 --> 04:16.560
not in there when we
closed up last night.

04:16.691 --> 04:17.779
And what time was that?

04:17.909 --> 04:19.737
Right at dark.
Around 7:00?

04:19.868 --> 04:21.173
Opened up again at first light.

04:21.304 --> 04:22.262
All right, so we're looking

04:22.392 --> 04:23.611
at about a 12-hour window.

04:25.090 --> 04:26.831
Hey, guys, for what it's worth,

04:26.962 --> 04:28.485
I'm smelling alcohol here.

04:28.616 --> 04:31.401
I don't drink a whole lot,
but, uh, maybe tequila?

04:31.532 --> 04:34.448
So perhaps the lieutenant
drunkenly wandered

04:34.578 --> 04:35.753
out here
in the middle of the night,

04:35.884 --> 04:37.581
climbed in the back seat
to sleep it off?

04:37.712 --> 04:39.757
Until the firing started
in the morning? I-I...

04:39.888 --> 04:41.933
Anything's possible.

04:42.978 --> 04:44.849
How many shooters have you
had here this morning?

04:44.980 --> 04:47.156
Uh, 20, maybe 30 so far.

04:47.287 --> 04:49.201
We keep sign-in books
at the front desk.

04:49.332 --> 04:51.291
Got every name
and weapon listed.

04:51.421 --> 04:52.857
We're gonna need those.

04:53.902 --> 04:55.643
What, I have to go get 'em?

04:55.773 --> 04:57.297
Hell with it.

04:57.427 --> 04:58.907
- Okay, fine.
- No, no, no, you stay here.

04:59.037 --> 05:00.300
- I'll go, okay?
- No, I'm going.
Look, no, I'm going.

05:00.430 --> 05:01.170
I'm going. Dad... Yup, you're going.

05:01.301 --> 05:02.476
How close are we, Jimmy?

05:02.606 --> 05:03.999
I'm ready.

05:04.129 --> 05:06.958
But... body's so large

05:07.089 --> 05:08.656
and, frankly, perforated,

05:08.786 --> 05:11.572
i-it might be easier
to-to cut out the back seat,

05:11.702 --> 05:12.964
use as a gurney of sorts.

05:13.095 --> 05:15.053
What?
Is that really necessary?

05:17.317 --> 05:19.144
I mean, why don't we
take the whole car?

05:19.275 --> 05:21.277
With the body and whatever
evidence is in there.

05:21.408 --> 05:22.583
Can't argue with that.

05:22.713 --> 05:24.236
All right, I'll call in a tow.

05:24.367 --> 05:27.239
Hey, Agent Parker?
Yeah, here's our sign-in books.

05:27.370 --> 05:29.067
Not even a floppy disk?

05:29.198 --> 05:31.026
It's too high-tech
for my old man.

05:32.419 --> 05:33.768
Well,

05:33.898 --> 05:36.031
we can forget
the drunken wandering part.

05:36.161 --> 05:37.772
Post-mortem lividity
and the lack

05:37.902 --> 05:39.991
of blood in the back
seat says that...

05:40.122 --> 05:42.907
Lieutenant here was killed
and then dumped here.

05:43.038 --> 05:45.997
Ah, so we've got ourselves
an old-school coverup attempt.

05:46.128 --> 05:48.173
Isolating the bullet
that killed him--

05:48.304 --> 05:50.741
that's gonna be like
finding a needle in a haystack.

05:50.872 --> 05:52.569
A grain of sand at the beach.

05:52.700 --> 05:54.179
A black cat in a coal mine.

05:54.310 --> 05:55.442
Yeah, yeah, these are all good.

05:55.572 --> 05:57.400
Whatever metaphor we go with,

05:57.531 --> 06:00.229
I imagine that's precisely
what the killer was counting on.

06:08.977 --> 06:10.805
Lieutenant Victor Bateson,

06:10.935 --> 06:13.068
35 years old,
former active duty,

06:13.198 --> 06:15.462
joined the Reserves
two years ago.

06:15.592 --> 06:16.898
No next of kin listed.

06:17.028 --> 06:18.334
Okay, thank you.

06:18.465 --> 06:20.510
And that was
Bateson's C.O.

06:20.641 --> 06:22.251
She said he was a model officer

06:22.382 --> 06:25.167
- and something of a gentle giant.
- Any employment records?

06:25.297 --> 06:27.212
Apparently, Bateson hadn't
nailed down a permanent career

06:27.343 --> 06:29.127
since retirement,
so between Reserve duties

06:29.258 --> 06:30.999
he worked a bunch
of part-time jobs.

06:31.129 --> 06:32.043
Such as?

06:33.044 --> 06:34.306
The last the C.O. spoke to him

06:34.437 --> 06:35.960
was two days ago,
as he headed to work

06:36.091 --> 06:38.049
at a Lionheart Bar and Grill
in Old Town.

06:38.180 --> 06:40.443
Okay, great. Why don't you
and Torres take the Lionheart

06:40.574 --> 06:42.402
and we'll, uh,
visit the C.O.

06:42.532 --> 06:43.751
Actually,
I was thinking that maybe

06:43.881 --> 06:45.753
I can help Kasie search the car.

06:45.883 --> 06:48.190
Since it's still in
the evidence garage.

06:49.234 --> 06:50.584
Sure.

06:50.714 --> 06:52.020
McGee?

06:52.150 --> 06:53.674
Oh, no need.

06:53.804 --> 06:56.067
I can see if I can get
the Lionheart to come to us.

07:01.769 --> 07:03.510
Too soon for a progress report?

07:03.640 --> 07:06.991
Never. This is, uh,
eight bullets down.

07:07.122 --> 07:09.037
142 to go.

07:09.167 --> 07:11.300
Really? 150 bullets?

07:11.431 --> 07:13.433
I can confirm
that one of these slugs,

07:13.563 --> 07:16.000
uh, nicked the lieutenant's
pulmonary artery,

07:16.131 --> 07:17.959
causing him to bleed out
in just a matter of minutes.

07:18.089 --> 07:20.614
And when I say
"one of these slugs,"

07:20.744 --> 07:23.443
I mean all of those.

07:23.573 --> 07:26.315
His chest cavity alone
is so chock-full of lead,

07:26.446 --> 07:28.099
it's gonna be quite a while
before we figure out

07:28.230 --> 07:29.449
which bullet
actually killed him.

07:29.579 --> 07:30.928
Well, compare them all
against the guns

07:31.059 --> 07:32.147
listed in Gorton's books

07:32.277 --> 07:33.627
and process of elimination...

07:33.757 --> 07:35.150
Should give us
our killer bullet.

07:35.280 --> 07:37.631
Hopefully lead us to
whoever fired it, huh?

07:42.679 --> 07:44.376
Oh, sorry.
Was that out loud?

07:44.507 --> 07:45.987
Kind of.
What was that?

07:46.117 --> 07:48.032
Inappropriate.

07:48.163 --> 07:50.165
We do that
- around here sometimes.
- It's kind of

07:50.295 --> 07:52.776
a nervous tick-- autopsies
sometimes flash me back

07:52.907 --> 07:55.300
to that Operation game I had
as a kid. You know, with the

07:55.431 --> 07:57.215
- annoying buzzer?
- Yeah, yeah, that's still around.

07:57.346 --> 07:58.652
It's actually
Victoria's favorite.

07:58.782 --> 08:00.131
What, your daughter?

08:00.262 --> 08:01.698
Yeah, she's also
discovered, uh, Mouse Trap,

08:01.829 --> 08:03.700
- Remember that one?
- Oh, yeah, hell yeah.

08:03.831 --> 08:05.441
With the, uh, the, the,

08:05.572 --> 08:07.617
the marble and the mouseYeah...

08:07.748 --> 08:09.750
- and the trap coming down.
- Little plastic pieces
that kids can choke on?

08:09.880 --> 08:11.926
- Timeless classic, right?
- Yeah.

08:14.232 --> 08:16.278
And still inappropriate.

08:16.408 --> 08:19.499
- Mm.
- Uh, how long till we have
the fatal bullets?

08:20.500 --> 08:22.197
Uh, not sure,
but I will keep pulling

08:22.327 --> 08:24.416
all night long
until I find them.

08:24.547 --> 08:26.593
No.

08:26.723 --> 08:28.551
No?

08:28.682 --> 08:30.727
I mean, sure, you can
work late if you want,

08:30.858 --> 08:33.425
but you got a kid--
be home before bedtime.

08:33.556 --> 08:35.645
The lieutenant will still be
here in the morning.

08:36.603 --> 08:38.474
Okay, I get it, I get it.

08:38.605 --> 08:40.911
A little reverse psychology.
Let me assure you,

08:41.042 --> 08:42.652
completely unnecessary.

08:42.783 --> 08:44.045
If I come back here at midnight

08:44.175 --> 08:46.308
and you're still here,
you're fired.

08:46.438 --> 08:47.483
Really?

08:47.614 --> 08:49.616
No, not really, but you know.

08:49.746 --> 08:51.879
Got it.

08:53.402 --> 08:56.187
Double reverse psychology.

08:56.318 --> 08:59.539
Not bad. Not bad.

09:00.757 --> 09:01.976
I can't believe it.

09:02.106 --> 09:04.021
I just left him a message
an hour ago,

09:04.152 --> 09:05.936
wondering where he was.

09:06.067 --> 09:08.460
Peacekeeper is never
late for work, but I...

09:08.591 --> 09:11.202
I never for once thought that...

09:11.333 --> 09:12.377
Peacekeeper?

09:12.508 --> 09:14.205
Best bouncer I ever had.

09:14.336 --> 09:16.425
Victor has this gift

09:16.556 --> 09:18.035
for dealing with people,
for...

09:18.166 --> 09:19.820
for keeping the peace.

09:19.950 --> 09:22.605
Still, being a bouncer,
he must have made a few enemies.

09:22.736 --> 09:25.956
Rarely had to raise his voice,
let alone a fist.

09:26.087 --> 09:28.655
You said he left work last night

09:28.785 --> 09:30.657
at around 2:00 a.m.

09:30.787 --> 09:32.659
Any chance he'd been drinking?

09:33.964 --> 09:36.358
He usually had a few
around closing time.

09:36.488 --> 09:38.490
He didn't seem drunk,
if that's what you're asking.

09:38.621 --> 09:40.754
Do you know
if he owned any firearms?

09:42.364 --> 09:43.670
He was found
at Gorton's shooting range,

09:43.800 --> 09:45.062
not too far from here.

09:46.281 --> 09:48.109
I mean, I couldn't say for sure.

09:48.239 --> 09:49.589
Uh...

09:49.719 --> 09:51.329
And how about you?

09:51.460 --> 09:53.636
O-Oh... I-I'm...

09:53.767 --> 09:55.638
I'm more of a "Louisville
Slugger behind the bar"

09:55.769 --> 09:56.900
kind of guy.

09:57.031 --> 09:58.119
But

09:58.249 --> 09:59.511
if you're looking for somebody

09:59.642 --> 10:01.775
who knows the shooting ranges...

10:02.906 --> 10:05.256
...you should
talk to Annie Oakley.

10:05.387 --> 10:06.823
Annie Oakley?

10:06.954 --> 10:10.087
Uh, yeah, it's-it's
Victor's ex-wife.

10:10.218 --> 10:11.828
I mean, at least
that's what he called her.

10:13.090 --> 10:15.310
And I am in no way
pointing fingers, but...

10:15.440 --> 10:17.965
I-I do recall him
telling me

10:18.095 --> 10:20.924
that they had
a pretty messy divorce.

10:21.055 --> 10:23.274
Like, real bad.

10:26.103 --> 10:27.844
Bullet hole 189.

10:27.975 --> 10:30.978
Ooh.
It's like an art installation.

10:31.108 --> 10:34.111
<i>Swiss Cheese
in Rusted Metal.</i>

10:34.242 --> 10:35.722
Well, I guess

10:35.852 --> 10:37.985
art is in the eye
of the beholder.

10:38.115 --> 10:40.291
Pretty sure that's beauty.

10:40.422 --> 10:42.119
Well, tomato, "potahto," right?

10:42.250 --> 10:45.601
Hmm. Well, look at the time.
Got to go.

10:45.732 --> 10:48.169
Can't do much until Jimmy
pulls bullets anyway,

10:48.299 --> 10:50.867
so...
Night.

10:50.998 --> 10:54.479
- Yes?
- What? Oh, I get it.

10:54.610 --> 10:56.786
Knight. Night, Knight.

10:56.917 --> 10:58.962
- Night.
- Good night.

11:01.312 --> 11:02.923
So what's with the clunker?

11:03.053 --> 11:05.229
It really isn't a clunker.

11:05.360 --> 11:07.144
Not to you, it isn't.

11:07.275 --> 11:09.233
What's the deal?

11:11.148 --> 11:13.455
Okay, so my very first car

11:13.585 --> 11:15.631
was the same make,
model and year.

11:15.762 --> 11:17.764
Here it is.

11:19.069 --> 11:21.115
I guess I was
a tad sentimental.

11:21.245 --> 11:23.378
Maybe a really big tad.

11:24.335 --> 11:26.990
You know, I do have
a mechanic friend that maybe...

11:27.121 --> 11:28.818
maybe he could restore it

11:28.949 --> 11:30.994
or at least
give it a proper burial.

11:32.909 --> 11:34.389
Well, my sympathies,

11:34.519 --> 11:36.391
but Parker just got an
address on the ex-wife.

11:36.521 --> 11:38.698
- You need me?
- No, no, no. You
stay, it's cool.

11:38.828 --> 11:40.569
You go ahead and, uh,

11:40.700 --> 11:42.658
make the funeral arrangements.

11:43.746 --> 11:44.921
Night.

11:45.052 --> 11:46.749
Night, Knight.

11:46.880 --> 11:48.490
Night-Knight.

11:48.620 --> 11:51.232
Now, I just, I figured
it was something like that.

11:51.362 --> 11:53.364
You-you never forget
your first car.

11:53.495 --> 11:55.279
First anything, really.

11:55.410 --> 11:57.107
Torres had the
look in his eyes

11:57.238 --> 12:00.110
like I still get when I watch
the original <i>King Kong.</i>

12:00.241 --> 12:02.112
My favorite old
movie as a kid.

12:02.243 --> 12:05.028
Oh, whoa.

12:05.159 --> 12:07.030
And that is
my second

12:07.161 --> 12:09.772
childhood reminiscence
of the day.

12:09.903 --> 12:11.600
So...

12:11.731 --> 12:15.256
So isn't that like a sign
of impending doom?

12:15.386 --> 12:18.128
Like a, uh, like a heart attack
or something?

12:18.259 --> 12:20.174
Well, are you smelling
any burnt toast?

12:20.304 --> 12:22.089
'Cause it could be a stroke.

12:22.219 --> 12:24.221
Whole wheat or rye?
Does it matter?

12:24.352 --> 12:26.310
Not if you're just
being paranoid,

12:26.441 --> 12:28.138
but if I start talking
about Malibu Barbie,

12:28.269 --> 12:29.749
then we're gonna know
it's contagious.

12:29.879 --> 12:31.881
Oh...

12:39.367 --> 12:40.934
Kasie?

12:43.850 --> 12:46.374
Uh, you guys.

12:46.504 --> 12:48.158
What are you doing here?

12:48.289 --> 12:49.551
What are <i>you</i> doing here?

12:49.681 --> 12:52.641
We're here to see
the ex-wife of our victim.

12:52.772 --> 12:54.599
Ex-wife of our victim?

12:54.730 --> 12:56.645
I would've gotten it, Kasie.

12:58.690 --> 13:00.257
Friends of yours?

13:00.388 --> 13:02.346
We're looking
for Lexi Davis.

13:02.477 --> 13:04.566
Uh, sure.

13:04.696 --> 13:06.786
Lexi's in here.

13:07.743 --> 13:10.180
Zaneta Firearms has taken
all the qualities

13:10.311 --> 13:13.227
of your standard revolver
and given it a grip that

13:13.357 --> 13:15.272
will fit your hand just right.

13:15.403 --> 13:17.100
Now, who would like to try?

13:18.188 --> 13:20.756
Lexi, we have
some new guests.

13:20.887 --> 13:23.193
Hi. Welcome.
What can I do for you?

13:23.324 --> 13:26.109
NCIS, Ms. Davis.

13:26.240 --> 13:27.894
Any chance
for a private word?

13:28.024 --> 13:29.939
We, uh, have a
few questions.

13:30.070 --> 13:32.463
I have
a few questions of my own.

13:40.602 --> 13:43.257
First of all,
if I had known this woman was

13:43.387 --> 13:45.346
ex-wife of our victim,
I wouldn't even be here.

13:45.476 --> 13:47.000
Well, we didn't find out
ourselves till about

13:47.130 --> 13:49.263
an hour ago.
But why are you here?

13:49.393 --> 13:52.614
Uh, for pretty much
the reasons you might guess.

13:52.744 --> 13:54.834
You're in the market for
a gun and you didn't tell me?

13:54.964 --> 13:57.271
You know I can hook you up.

13:57.401 --> 13:59.055
Well, see, that's
why I didn't tell anyone.

13:59.186 --> 14:00.709
I don't need hooking up.

14:00.840 --> 14:02.537
I don't definitely know
that I'm in the market.

14:02.667 --> 14:05.366
Mm. Kind of seems
like you're in the market.

14:07.281 --> 14:09.718
I can't believe it, you know?

14:09.849 --> 14:11.807
Everyone loved Victor.

14:11.938 --> 14:13.591
Who would do such a thing?

14:13.722 --> 14:17.204
I don't know. Maybe, uh,
ex-wife with a grudge, possibly?

14:17.334 --> 14:19.641
Wait, so...

14:19.771 --> 14:21.991
the grapevine tells you
that we have a messy divorce,

14:22.122 --> 14:24.472
and, just like that,
I'm a suspect?

14:24.602 --> 14:26.039
No, we're just talking.

14:26.169 --> 14:28.998
But also... yeah?

14:29.129 --> 14:31.783
It was awful.
But...

14:31.914 --> 14:33.873
we worked through it
the last two years.

14:34.003 --> 14:35.962
- So you still spoke to him?
- All the time.

14:36.092 --> 14:38.051
You know, Victor and I were...

14:40.401 --> 14:43.317
Oh, my God, I mean, how did...
how did it even happen?

14:43.447 --> 14:45.885
He was found with...

14:46.015 --> 14:48.191
multiple gunshot wounds.

14:48.322 --> 14:50.063
At Gorton's shooting range.

14:50.193 --> 14:52.892
Any chance this photo
was taken there?

14:54.502 --> 14:56.678
That hellhole?
No, I would-I would never

14:56.808 --> 14:58.332
set foot in there,
and neither would Victor.

14:58.462 --> 14:59.942
But you do know the place.

15:00.073 --> 15:01.857
Only by reputation.

15:01.988 --> 15:04.904
I represent responsible
gun ownership, Agents.

15:05.034 --> 15:06.862
Unlike Gorton, who let some...

15:06.993 --> 15:08.559
idiot throw a grenade there
last year.

15:08.690 --> 15:10.039
Where were you last night?

15:10.170 --> 15:11.736
I was preparing for this.

15:11.867 --> 15:13.521
Hosting private gun salons

15:13.651 --> 15:15.305
in your living room is a hobby?

15:15.436 --> 15:18.004
No, it's my livelihood.

15:18.134 --> 15:20.267
I'm marketing director
for Zaneta.

15:20.397 --> 15:22.704
My sales rep, Doris--
she holds these events

15:22.834 --> 15:24.967
to help expand our
female-focused market.

15:25.098 --> 15:27.622
Neither of which implicate me,
either, by the way.

15:27.752 --> 15:30.842
You have any idea
who we can implicate?

15:30.973 --> 15:32.540
None.

15:32.670 --> 15:33.933
You know, V...

15:34.063 --> 15:36.979
Victor was like
a big teddy bear. I...

15:37.110 --> 15:38.676
I doubt it was
anyone at the bar.

15:38.807 --> 15:39.851
You know,
he loved that job.

15:39.982 --> 15:41.331
Unlike his new gig.

15:41.462 --> 15:42.811
And what gig is that?

15:42.942 --> 15:44.900
The Fairfax Expo Center.

15:45.031 --> 15:47.337
He'd only been there
a month or two, but

15:47.468 --> 15:49.209
said it was
a lot less dangerous

15:49.339 --> 15:51.211
dealing with the drunks
than the...

15:51.341 --> 15:52.777
trade show crazies

15:52.908 --> 15:54.954
and the beauty pageant
stage moms, you know?

15:57.739 --> 15:59.480
Who knows what to think?

16:00.916 --> 16:03.136
She seem credible to you?

16:03.266 --> 16:04.876
So far.

16:05.007 --> 16:07.705
Let's, uh, look
for some potential enemies

16:07.836 --> 16:09.881
at this Expo Center
first thing.

16:10.012 --> 16:11.971
Go get some sleep.

16:12.101 --> 16:14.016
- Good night.
- Night.

16:14.147 --> 16:16.627
And you...

16:16.758 --> 16:18.194
How did you end up
at the ladies' night

16:18.325 --> 16:20.196
- gun salon?
- Real spur-of-the-moment

16:20.327 --> 16:22.111
thing-- this woman
at my Krav Maga class...

16:22.242 --> 16:24.461
Wait, Israeli martial arts--

16:24.592 --> 16:26.594
is that how you've been spending
your lunchtime workouts?

16:28.596 --> 16:31.860
Pretty much since my brush with
mortality in the squad room.

16:31.991 --> 16:35.124
I thought it didn't
affect me, but, um...

16:35.255 --> 16:36.996
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
- Come here!

16:37.126 --> 16:37.997
No!

16:40.477 --> 16:41.826
- Aah!
- Kasie!

16:45.221 --> 16:47.441
It affected you.

16:49.095 --> 16:51.967
But the workouts help enough
that when the instructor

16:52.098 --> 16:55.840
mentioned this gun salon,
I got curious.

16:55.971 --> 16:57.320
Though you're still
on the fence?

16:57.451 --> 16:58.800
Pretty big step for me.

16:58.930 --> 17:00.367
Is it, though?

17:00.497 --> 17:02.108
I mean, you shoot guns
at work all the time.

17:02.238 --> 17:04.719
Mm, into a ballistics chamber.

17:04.849 --> 17:07.200
It's a little
different having one

17:07.330 --> 17:09.071
on my nightstand.

17:09.202 --> 17:10.768
I mean,
it's there to keep me safe.

17:10.899 --> 17:14.207
But maybe it just reminds me
what I'm afraid of.

17:14.337 --> 17:15.860
Yeah, I get it.

17:15.991 --> 17:18.776
So no pressure.

17:18.907 --> 17:21.170
But if you needto talk.

17:23.259 --> 17:25.044
You're the one I talk to.

17:31.876 --> 17:33.008
Hmm.

17:33.139 --> 17:34.531
You're telling me
that the ex-wife

17:34.662 --> 17:36.229
was hosting a Tupperware party?

17:36.359 --> 17:38.840
Oh, no, no, I said it was
like a Tupperware party...

17:38.970 --> 17:41.886
Yo, my dude.
Uh, yeah, Nick here.

17:42.017 --> 17:44.672
Uh, that's three
messages now, but, uh,

17:44.802 --> 17:46.891
I wouldn't be calling
you if I didn't have

17:47.022 --> 17:50.330
a special mission for you,
so give me a call me back.

17:51.983 --> 17:54.421
My car guy. He's
playing hard to get.

17:54.551 --> 17:56.379
Anything new
on the case?

17:56.510 --> 17:58.468
So, "like" a Tupperware
party, you were saying?

17:58.599 --> 18:00.383
But with handguns for women.

18:00.514 --> 18:03.256
Apparently the female market
is booming.

18:03.386 --> 18:05.432
Not for anybody we know,
per se, but,

18:05.562 --> 18:06.607
you know, still...

18:06.737 --> 18:08.174
booming.

18:08.304 --> 18:09.871
Booming.

18:13.440 --> 18:15.485
Well, well, well.

18:15.616 --> 18:17.357
Look who's the early bird.

18:17.487 --> 18:19.663
- You pull an all-nighter?
Perish the thought.

18:19.794 --> 18:21.578
All-nighters are
for missing children.

18:21.709 --> 18:23.711
And term papers and honeymoons.

18:23.841 --> 18:26.670
But I did get in
early enough

18:26.801 --> 18:29.412
to find this, uh,
Fairfax Expo Center

18:29.543 --> 18:31.153
the ex-wife was
telling us about.

18:31.284 --> 18:32.763
Where Bateson worked security.

18:32.894 --> 18:34.635
Yeah.
They did actually host

18:34.765 --> 18:36.680
a Little Miss Fairfax pageant

18:36.811 --> 18:38.639
two weeks ago.

18:38.769 --> 18:40.206
Please don't tell me
we're actually

18:40.336 --> 18:41.946
thinking killer dance moms.

18:42.077 --> 18:44.732
Oh, no, I was sure hoping so,
until I saw

18:44.862 --> 18:46.908
what they were hosting
this week.

18:47.038 --> 18:48.692
Tri-State Home Security Expo.

18:48.823 --> 18:49.954
You ever been
to one of those?

18:50.085 --> 18:52.609
Spy-cams, mace, stun guns

18:52.740 --> 18:55.046
and a lot
of wannabe Dirty Harrys.

18:55.177 --> 18:57.571
Maybe our Peacekeeper failed
to keep the peace somehow.

18:57.701 --> 18:59.225
And actually did get killed.

18:59.355 --> 19:01.749
Okay, Expo Center it is.

19:03.142 --> 19:05.448
I'll meet you guys at the car.

19:06.754 --> 19:09.626
152 slugs, to be exact.

19:09.757 --> 19:11.193
I pulled these little devils

19:11.324 --> 19:12.629
from right around
the pulmonary artery.

19:12.760 --> 19:14.240
So we start with those,

19:14.370 --> 19:16.459
hopefully we find our culprit
sooner rather than later.

19:16.590 --> 19:18.461
I admire your optimism.

19:18.592 --> 19:21.116
- Hey Kase, you want
to check out a...

19:21.247 --> 19:23.510
- Hey, Jimmy.
- Hey, Jess.

19:28.079 --> 19:30.647
So, we are heading over
to a security expo.

19:30.778 --> 19:32.519
If you want to tag along,

19:32.649 --> 19:34.129
maybe you'll see
something that you like.

19:34.260 --> 19:35.957
Oh, wow, gosh,
I-I'd really love to,

19:36.087 --> 19:37.828
but I got so much work
to do here.

19:37.959 --> 19:39.961
Oh, wow, you sure do.

19:40.091 --> 19:41.658
Okay, so next time.
Rain check?

19:41.789 --> 19:43.747
- Yeah. Bye, Jess.
- All right. Bye.

19:43.878 --> 19:44.966
Bye, Jimmy.

19:46.663 --> 19:49.144
That is exactly the type
of pressure from friends

19:49.275 --> 19:50.798
I was hoping to avoid.

19:50.928 --> 19:52.713
You're calling that pressure?

19:52.843 --> 19:54.802
I mean, what are the
chances they walk in

19:54.932 --> 19:56.847
on the one night I was
shopping for a gun?

19:56.978 --> 19:59.241
So you're officially
- shopping now.
- No.

19:59.372 --> 20:00.982
Yes.

20:01.112 --> 20:02.636
- I don't know.
- I get it,

20:02.766 --> 20:05.639
I get it, I do.
W.W.G.S., right?

20:05.769 --> 20:07.989
That's exactly what I want to
know. What would Gibbs say?

20:08.119 --> 20:10.470
I think he would say
take a breath.

20:10.600 --> 20:12.689
You can be conflicted
while still shopping.

20:12.820 --> 20:15.257
And why aren't you
conflicted again?

20:15.388 --> 20:17.738
Because of all these.

20:17.868 --> 20:20.567
I don't own a gun
because of all of the bullets

20:20.697 --> 20:24.353
I've pulled from way too
many people over the years.

20:24.484 --> 20:26.964
My nana did had
a 12-gauge though.

20:27.095 --> 20:29.750
That was plenty of gun
for the family Palmer.

20:29.880 --> 20:31.708
I'm actually leaning
towards your side

20:31.839 --> 20:33.493
of the line, if
not for, um...

20:33.623 --> 20:35.973
being so damn afraid.

20:36.104 --> 20:38.237
After the diner last year?

20:40.064 --> 20:41.892
Made worse by LeMere
in the squad room.

20:42.023 --> 20:44.330
And both times, I
was saved by Gibbs.

20:44.460 --> 20:47.246
Meaning it's on me when
strike three happens.

20:47.376 --> 20:49.465
Oh, come on, you cannot
be worried about that.

20:49.596 --> 20:51.467
I didn't used to be.
My whole life--

20:51.598 --> 20:53.730
not a care in the world,
then all of a sudden...

20:55.558 --> 20:58.082
Man, I would
give anything to go back

20:58.213 --> 20:59.823
and just not feel this way.

20:59.954 --> 21:02.696
Look, you don't have
to go back in time.

21:02.826 --> 21:05.438
Kase, what you are feeling

21:05.568 --> 21:07.527
is a normal reaction.

21:07.657 --> 21:09.659
All you need right now
is more time.

21:09.790 --> 21:11.835
- Just to heal.
- Oh.

21:11.966 --> 21:13.750
There's that optimism.

21:13.881 --> 21:15.665
You'll get
that back again, too.

21:15.796 --> 21:17.885
Okay.

21:20.496 --> 21:22.759
Could use a new alarm system.

21:22.890 --> 21:24.805
Mine goes off so often,

21:24.935 --> 21:27.111
I'm more in danger
from my neighbors.

21:27.242 --> 21:29.375
Oh, this is what
I'm talking about right here.

21:32.029 --> 21:33.814
Oh.
Easy there, Bruce Lee.

21:33.944 --> 21:35.424
Wouldn't want you
to hurt yourself.

21:35.555 --> 21:37.905
You know, just a little...

21:38.035 --> 21:40.429
hand-eye coordination.

21:41.778 --> 21:44.215
Sir, please put that down.
Uh, you... you folks

21:44.346 --> 21:45.913
will have to wait outside.
Doors don't open till 10:00.

21:46.043 --> 21:48.742
Uh, we're with NCIS, miss...

21:48.872 --> 21:50.483
I'm so sorry.
Sonia Bell.

21:50.613 --> 21:51.919
Event coordinator.

21:52.049 --> 21:53.224
Oh, we've all just
been so scattered

21:53.355 --> 21:54.443
here this morning.

21:54.574 --> 21:55.618
I take it you're
here about Victor?

21:55.749 --> 21:57.185
You already know?

21:57.316 --> 21:59.100
I still can't believe it.

21:59.230 --> 22:00.536
He was kind,

22:00.667 --> 22:03.147
professional.
A real godsend.

22:03.278 --> 22:04.540
Everyone loved him.

22:04.671 --> 22:05.802
Yeah, we've been
hearing that a lot.

22:05.933 --> 22:07.326
How'd you find out?

22:07.456 --> 22:09.980
Oh, um, from Doris,
over there in booth six.

22:10.111 --> 22:12.331
Found her crying
in the bathroom this morning.

22:12.461 --> 22:14.811
Oh. I'm so sorry,
I have to take this.

22:14.942 --> 22:16.422
Hello? This is she.

22:16.552 --> 22:17.640
Familiar face.

22:17.771 --> 22:19.381
Last night's Tupperware lady.

22:19.512 --> 22:22.297
Let's divide and conquer.

22:26.301 --> 22:28.695
Doris.
How you doing?

22:28.825 --> 22:30.349
Remember us?

22:30.479 --> 22:32.394
You were... you were
at Lexi's last night.

22:32.525 --> 22:33.439
So were you.

22:33.569 --> 22:34.614
She called me

22:34.744 --> 22:36.050
right after you left her.

22:37.399 --> 22:39.706
I still can't quite believe it.

22:39.836 --> 22:41.751
When was the last time
you saw Victor?

22:41.882 --> 22:43.318
Um...

22:43.449 --> 22:45.668
he helped set up my booth
just two days ago.

22:47.278 --> 22:49.019
It's an even bigger spread
than last night.

22:49.150 --> 22:51.370
We can hardly
keep up with demand.

22:51.500 --> 22:53.110
Inventory just
flies off the shelves.

22:53.241 --> 22:54.808
And, uh, which one do you use?

22:54.938 --> 22:57.332
Well, personally, I...

23:00.030 --> 23:02.076
Why-why do you ask?

23:02.206 --> 23:03.991
Seems like a harmless question.

23:04.121 --> 23:05.993
She uses the
fancy pink one.

23:06.123 --> 23:07.342
What do
you think?

23:07.473 --> 23:08.952
Or maybe she likes the leopard.

23:09.083 --> 23:10.606
There a problem, buddy?

23:11.607 --> 23:12.913
Hell yeah, there's a problem.

23:13.043 --> 23:14.654
My inventory
would be flying, too,

23:14.784 --> 23:15.959
if that glorified bouncer
gave me

23:16.090 --> 23:17.439
the prime real estate she got.

23:17.570 --> 23:19.485
Instead he sticks me
way the hell back here in this

23:19.615 --> 23:22.618
bum spot. Damn bouncer's
playing favorites.

23:22.749 --> 23:25.708
Victor got me this spot.

23:25.839 --> 23:27.101
That's what friends do.

23:27.231 --> 23:28.929
It's not my fault
no one's buying

23:29.059 --> 23:31.061
his old carbines.

23:32.541 --> 23:34.238
He puts her right
by the front door

23:34.369 --> 23:36.066
while I'm dying over here
by the bathroom.

23:36.197 --> 23:38.112
Some might argue that that's

23:38.242 --> 23:40.419
actually the better place
to do business.

23:40.549 --> 23:43.422
Plus, what she's got going on
over there-- it's a travesty.

23:43.552 --> 23:45.293
Painting perfectly good firearms

23:45.424 --> 23:47.077
all the different colors
of the rainbow.

23:47.208 --> 23:48.644
So is your problem
with her product?

23:48.775 --> 23:51.168
- Or with the bouncer?
- I gave him an earful

23:51.299 --> 23:52.735
for sticking me over here.

23:52.866 --> 23:55.216
But he wouldn't bite.
Kept it friendly, so...

23:55.346 --> 23:57.914
took all the fun out of it,
so I stopped.

23:59.263 --> 24:01.048
Yeah, you like
that one?

24:01.178 --> 24:03.050
Well, my dad had one
just like this.

24:03.180 --> 24:04.660
Yeah, your dad
had a beauty.

24:04.791 --> 24:06.488
- Civil War era?
- Yeah, you bet.

24:06.619 --> 24:09.143
Colt 1862 Pocket Navy.

24:09.273 --> 24:13.582
.36 caliber, seven-and-a-
half-inch octagon barrel.

24:13.713 --> 24:16.063
1,300 bucks.

24:17.891 --> 24:19.849
At least make
me an offer.

24:19.980 --> 24:23.026
Um... I will,
uh, I'll think about it.

24:23.157 --> 24:25.159
And you carry ammo
for a gun like that?

24:25.289 --> 24:27.553
At home.
No point in selling it here.

24:27.683 --> 24:29.468
Oh, let me guess--
uh, pink bullets

24:29.598 --> 24:31.382
- scooped up your market?
- No.

24:31.513 --> 24:32.732
That dirtbag
out in the parking lot

24:32.862 --> 24:34.255
I can't compete with.

24:34.385 --> 24:35.822
What dirtbag?

24:35.952 --> 24:38.302
The one selling ammo
out the back of his truck.

24:38.433 --> 24:40.870
<i>I think his name was Roy.</i>

24:41.001 --> 24:43.264
He's the only guy I ever
saw Victor get rough with.

24:43.394 --> 24:45.179
For selling bootleg ammo?

24:46.180 --> 24:47.398
How rough?

24:47.529 --> 24:49.488
Threw him
out of the parking lot.

24:49.618 --> 24:52.055
And I mean literally threw him.

24:52.186 --> 24:53.927
I don't think
he's coming back.

24:54.057 --> 24:55.537
<i>Ah, I'm sure he's back.</i>

24:55.668 --> 24:58.671
You can only get rid
of cockroaches for so long.

25:05.634 --> 25:08.550
Excuse me.
You wouldn't be Roy, by chance?

25:08.681 --> 25:11.379
Depends who you are,
pretty lady.

25:11.510 --> 25:12.772
What can I do you for?

25:12.902 --> 25:14.164
Well, you can start

25:14.295 --> 25:15.905
by showing me
your dealer's license.

25:17.907 --> 25:19.561
For dealing what now?

25:19.692 --> 25:20.954
Whatever's in your van.

25:21.084 --> 25:23.783
Mm, keep guessing.
I got nothing.

25:25.524 --> 25:27.134
Nowhere to run, Roy.

25:30.746 --> 25:32.618
And he's running.

25:32.748 --> 25:34.184
He said nowhere to run.

25:34.315 --> 25:35.577
And he's running.

25:36.709 --> 25:38.624
Nope.

25:39.886 --> 25:40.843
Get off!

25:40.974 --> 25:42.932
Easy, easy.

25:46.327 --> 25:47.720
They never listen.

25:49.678 --> 25:51.201
This is a violation
of my rights.

25:51.332 --> 25:53.813
And selling bootleg ammo's
a violation of the law.

25:53.943 --> 25:56.555
It's a lot more
than ammo.

26:00.036 --> 26:02.386
Looks more like an armory.

26:12.135 --> 26:13.920
You guys got nothing on me.

26:14.050 --> 26:15.791
This baby would beg to differ.

26:15.922 --> 26:17.358
None of that's mine.

26:17.488 --> 26:19.360
- Never seen that before.
- But it is your van.

26:19.490 --> 26:20.796
Maybe.

26:20.927 --> 26:22.450
Another genius.

26:22.581 --> 26:25.453
All right,
ATF's on the way.

26:25.584 --> 26:27.150
All right.
I'll forward these photos.

26:27.281 --> 26:28.978
Okay, hang on,hang on.

26:29.109 --> 26:30.676
A buddy of mine

26:30.806 --> 26:32.416
makes a lot of this stuff
in his basement.

26:32.547 --> 26:34.593
We go halves on profits.
I-I can give him to you.

26:34.723 --> 26:36.203
Give him to ATF, Roy.

26:36.333 --> 26:37.770
We're more interested
in the Navy lieutenant

26:37.900 --> 26:39.075
you may have known.

26:39.206 --> 26:40.468
Me?

26:40.599 --> 26:42.862
I-I don't know any Navy.

26:42.992 --> 26:45.212
The security guard who kicked
you out the other day.

26:45.342 --> 26:46.779
Oh, that guy?

26:46.909 --> 26:48.650
You saying it was rent-a-cop
that turned me in?

26:48.781 --> 26:50.478
- No, he couldn't do that.
- Hey, let me tell you,

26:50.609 --> 26:52.045
he's who got rough with me.

26:52.175 --> 26:53.524
Anyone needs to be hassled
right now, it's him.

26:53.655 --> 26:55.091
Can't hassle a dead guy.

26:55.222 --> 26:57.920
Wait.
He's dead?

26:58.051 --> 27:00.444
Now, you obviously
have the means.

27:00.575 --> 27:01.837
Plus the motive.

27:01.968 --> 27:04.100
Which makes you our guy.

27:04.231 --> 27:05.058
But I'm not.

27:06.581 --> 27:08.148
I-I swear. You can ask
that girlfriend of his.

27:08.278 --> 27:09.584
She saw the whole thing.

27:09.715 --> 27:10.846
What girlfriend?

27:10.977 --> 27:12.587
The-the hottie
selling pink guns.

27:12.718 --> 27:14.197
They were all
over each other

27:14.328 --> 27:16.591
in his truck
- when he threw me out.
- Doris?

27:16.722 --> 27:18.506
He was just trying
to impress her, if you ask me.

27:18.637 --> 27:20.769
She'll tell you.

27:20.900 --> 27:22.292
So why the big secret?

27:22.423 --> 27:23.642
I guess we kept it low-key
for so long,

27:23.772 --> 27:24.991
I didn't think it mattered.

27:25.121 --> 27:26.993
It sure does now.

27:27.123 --> 27:29.038
We didn't want anyone knowing.

27:29.169 --> 27:30.692
Least of all Lexi.

27:30.823 --> 27:33.956
Dating the boss's ex
is not quite the career move.

27:34.087 --> 27:36.480
Lexi's also my friend.

27:36.611 --> 27:38.308
Though sneaking around

27:38.439 --> 27:40.006
didn't make me feel like
a very good one.

27:40.136 --> 27:42.051
She was already
upset with Victor

27:42.182 --> 27:43.662
over the whole alimony thing.

27:44.880 --> 27:46.186
What alimony thing?

27:46.316 --> 27:48.318
How much was he paying her?

27:48.449 --> 27:50.016
Well, that's just it--
he wasn't.

27:50.146 --> 27:51.191
Deadbeat.

27:51.321 --> 27:52.714
No.

27:52.845 --> 27:54.673
She was paying him.

27:54.803 --> 27:57.066
It wasn't much, but...

27:57.197 --> 27:59.460
Wait, she was
paying him alimony?

27:59.590 --> 28:02.811
- It happens.
- But Victor struggled
with that, too.

28:02.942 --> 28:05.335
That's why he was working two
jobs to get out from under it.

28:05.466 --> 28:06.902
Look, if it was just
about our friendship,

28:07.033 --> 28:08.643
I'd have told Lexi
from the start.

28:08.774 --> 28:10.340
But throw in job and money...

28:10.471 --> 28:11.994
If Lexi found out about us,

28:12.125 --> 28:14.518
it might have meant
the end of both.

28:15.781 --> 28:17.783
Or worse.

28:28.489 --> 28:29.838
You okay?

28:29.969 --> 28:32.406
Jimmy, I'm sorry, I thought you

28:32.536 --> 28:34.495
- were with Kasie.
- I was, I just came down

28:34.625 --> 28:36.627
for one last X-ray
for the lieutenant.

28:36.758 --> 28:38.020
And you? I...

28:38.151 --> 28:39.761
Just, um...

28:39.892 --> 28:41.328
catching my breath
before we go off

28:41.458 --> 28:43.330
and scoop up the ex-wife.

28:45.462 --> 28:47.987
- It's nothing.
- This shallow
breathing of yours?

28:48.117 --> 28:50.250
This is... this
is not nothing.

28:51.947 --> 28:54.254
Not after the year
that you've had.

28:54.384 --> 28:56.865
What is it about this case
that's getting to you?

28:56.996 --> 28:58.606
I can fight and...

28:58.737 --> 28:59.955
and shoot and interrogate,

29:00.086 --> 29:01.783
negotiate, but...

29:01.914 --> 29:04.743
As soon as one of these cases
start turning into a soap opera,

29:04.873 --> 29:06.570
I just get this...

29:06.701 --> 29:10.879
Must all seem
pretty petty, right?

29:11.010 --> 29:13.099
Compared to losing
your team.

29:14.056 --> 29:16.102
Okay.

29:16.232 --> 29:18.582
Enough of this.

29:18.713 --> 29:19.888
All I'm saying

29:20.019 --> 29:22.282
is that involuntary
physical reactions

29:22.412 --> 29:27.243
are usually rooted
in traumatic experience.

29:28.244 --> 29:31.117
Which you and I have
both had plenty of.

29:38.037 --> 29:39.255
How we doing, Kasie?

29:39.386 --> 29:41.040
Amazing thing about gunpowder.

29:41.170 --> 29:42.693
Amaze me, please.

29:42.824 --> 29:44.957
In ancient China it was called
the elixir of life

29:45.087 --> 29:47.786
and ingested
in a quest for immortality.

29:47.916 --> 29:49.788
That is, until they
discovered its flammability

29:49.918 --> 29:50.963
and started attaching it

29:51.093 --> 29:52.181
to spears used for battle.

29:52.312 --> 29:53.661
In essence, the first bullets,

29:53.792 --> 29:55.445
which led us to this.

29:55.576 --> 29:57.752
An accidental invention
of epic proportions.

29:57.883 --> 29:59.319
Just like
chocolate chip cookies.

29:59.449 --> 30:02.278
- Though they never killed anyone.
- And much as I'd love

30:02.409 --> 30:04.541
to hear that story,
let's talk bullets.

30:04.672 --> 30:06.282
Jimmy and I started
with the ones

30:06.413 --> 30:09.155
pulled from Lieutenant
Bateson's upper chest,

30:09.285 --> 30:11.200
uh, but unfortunately,
they were all fired from guns

30:11.331 --> 30:14.377
listed in Gorton's
- sign-in books.
- So all were shot postmortem.

30:14.508 --> 30:16.466
Same with most every
other bullet you see here

30:16.597 --> 30:18.033
except for these three,

30:18.164 --> 30:20.644
which I am just about to test
right now.

30:20.775 --> 30:23.822
Oof. Okay.

30:23.952 --> 30:25.954
Once I compare ballistics
on these slugs

30:26.085 --> 30:27.651
and cross-reference
Gorton's books,

30:27.782 --> 30:29.653
we might finally know
our murder weapon.

30:29.784 --> 30:30.829
Which will take how long?

30:30.959 --> 30:32.395
Just a few more hours, tops.

30:32.526 --> 30:34.920
Any ideas what weapons
might have been used?

30:35.050 --> 30:37.139
Oh, ideas we got,
just no definitives yet.

30:37.270 --> 30:39.533
- Here's the list.
- Ideas will have to do.

30:39.663 --> 30:41.883
Torres and Knight
are bringing in the ex-wife.

30:42.014 --> 30:43.754
I really hope
Lexi's not our killer.

30:43.885 --> 30:45.365
She was super nice

30:45.495 --> 30:47.846
and not at all
who I expected to be hosting

30:47.976 --> 30:50.109
- a gun salon.
- Who were you expecting?

30:50.239 --> 30:52.415
Kind of
- a female Rambo type.
- Hmm.

30:52.546 --> 30:54.722
Who's to say she's not?

30:54.853 --> 30:56.680
Mind if I ask you something?

30:56.811 --> 30:58.291
Shoot. I mean...

30:58.421 --> 31:01.207
- go for it.
- Uh, it's about last night.

31:01.337 --> 31:03.383
I'm kind of collecting
perspectives

31:03.513 --> 31:04.993
on... Whether you should buy a gun?

31:05.124 --> 31:06.865
Oh. So you know.

31:06.995 --> 31:08.388
Well, why else
would you be there?

31:08.518 --> 31:10.433
I have to say, you, uh,
seem pretty comfortable

31:10.564 --> 31:11.870
shooting into that chamber.

31:12.000 --> 31:13.654
You didn't see my eyes close?

31:15.438 --> 31:17.310
So, what do you want to ask?

31:17.440 --> 31:19.051
Well, how you feel about yours.

31:19.181 --> 31:22.141
Do you ever wish
you didn't have one?

31:22.271 --> 31:24.883
No. I mean, as a cop,
absolutely not.

31:25.013 --> 31:27.886
But there are people out there
I sure wish didn't have one.

31:28.016 --> 31:29.322
Criminals, for one.

31:29.452 --> 31:31.890
And two and three.
And also people

31:32.020 --> 31:33.892
who can't handle not knowing
whether to use it or not.

31:34.022 --> 31:35.981
Or whether to use it at all.

31:36.111 --> 31:38.592
If some people walk around
with a hammer long enough,

31:38.722 --> 31:41.595
pretty soon, everything
starts to look like a nail.

31:41.725 --> 31:43.423
That's what I'm worried about.

31:43.553 --> 31:46.905
Yeah, do I grab it every time
somebody knocks on the door?

31:47.035 --> 31:49.385
I mean, my Uncle Reggie
shot an intruder once.

31:49.516 --> 31:51.561
As one might do to an intruder.

31:51.692 --> 31:53.781
And it haunted him
the rest of his life.

31:53.912 --> 31:57.611
And I don't see how any of that
helps me get back to normal.

31:57.741 --> 31:59.352
I can't speak to that, Kasie,

31:59.482 --> 32:01.789
but I do appreciate
that you're wrestling

32:01.920 --> 32:04.618
with the decision. That's more
than a lot of people do.

32:07.316 --> 32:10.667
Ah.
Ms. Rambo has arrived.

32:10.798 --> 32:12.669
Don't let her draw first blood.

32:13.670 --> 32:16.282
We'll give her
a war she won't believe.

32:19.850 --> 32:21.374
Yeah, I own two of these guns.

32:21.504 --> 32:24.899
Or, as we call them,
potential murder weapons.

32:25.030 --> 32:26.901
You still don't have an alibi.

32:27.032 --> 32:28.337
Or a motive.

32:28.468 --> 32:30.122
Funny thing about that.

32:30.252 --> 32:32.776
We just found out that you
were paying alimony to Victor.

32:32.907 --> 32:34.430
Pretty important detail
to leave out.

32:34.561 --> 32:37.085
I didn't see
how it was relevant.

32:37.216 --> 32:40.219
But, obviously,
as the primary breadwinner...

32:40.349 --> 32:42.656
I was rising fast in my company,

32:42.786 --> 32:45.267
and he was struggling
to find his footing.

32:45.398 --> 32:46.790
And you were happy
to help him out.

32:46.921 --> 32:48.270
I wouldn't say happy, but...

32:48.401 --> 32:49.576
Still pretty generous.

32:49.706 --> 32:50.925
Which would only make
any sort

32:51.056 --> 32:52.535
of betrayal
sting that much more.

32:52.666 --> 32:54.363
Betrayal? I...

32:54.494 --> 32:56.583
Doris.

32:58.019 --> 33:00.195
Wait.

33:00.326 --> 33:02.415
Really?

33:03.416 --> 33:04.852
What, you didn't know?

33:04.983 --> 33:06.288
No.

33:06.419 --> 33:08.160
I mean, how the hell
did I not see that?

33:08.290 --> 33:11.206
And why wouldn't they tell me?
We were all friends.

33:11.337 --> 33:13.426
Doris was also your employee.

33:13.556 --> 33:15.689
That's easy to forget sometimes.
I...

33:15.819 --> 33:17.082
If they would have told me,

33:17.212 --> 33:18.735
I would have
given them champagne.

33:18.866 --> 33:20.999
The two of them get hitched,
no more payments for me,

33:21.129 --> 33:22.609
and they can live
happily ever after.

33:25.655 --> 33:28.049
And now we're back
to me not having a motive.

33:34.447 --> 33:36.927
Parker sent us.

33:37.058 --> 33:39.495
Didn't think you
- want Rambo to hear.
- What is it?

33:39.626 --> 33:41.062
So, we found our
killer bullet.

33:41.193 --> 33:42.890
This needle in the haystack?

33:43.021 --> 33:45.066
It's a big one.

33:53.161 --> 33:55.033
So, is that our cause of death?

33:55.163 --> 33:57.644
Yes.
This .32 ACP, which,

33:57.774 --> 33:58.993
based on its trajectory,

33:59.124 --> 34:00.516
must have nicked the
pulmonary artery,

34:00.647 --> 34:02.475
causing him to bleed out
in a matter of minutes.

34:02.605 --> 34:04.390
You didn't find it until now?

34:04.520 --> 34:06.348
Because this big daddy bullet

34:06.479 --> 34:08.524
was fired postmortem
at the shooting range,

34:08.655 --> 34:11.310
it actually pushed the
little guy away from the artery

34:11.440 --> 34:12.833
and into the bone
of the vertebra.

34:12.963 --> 34:14.878
Basically obscuring
it from our view

34:15.009 --> 34:16.750
until I ran one last X-ray.

34:16.880 --> 34:19.187
So little guy's our culprit.

34:20.275 --> 34:22.321
- What do we know about it?
Well, just 'cause it's little

34:22.451 --> 34:24.192
doesn't mean it's weak.
It's actually famous--

34:24.323 --> 34:26.499
or rather infamous--
on two fronts.

34:26.629 --> 34:27.935
First as the self-inflicted bullet

34:28.066 --> 34:29.806
that Hitler used
to kill himself.

34:29.937 --> 34:31.678
And second,
as the bullet of choice

34:31.808 --> 34:34.507
in James Bond's old Walther PPK.

34:34.637 --> 34:36.770
So that's the kind of gun
our killer used.

34:36.900 --> 34:38.467
Yeah, or a gun like it.

34:38.598 --> 34:41.079
Can't say for sure,
but something old,

34:41.209 --> 34:43.037
circa early 1900s.

34:43.168 --> 34:45.866
Nick, who do we know
who has old guns?

34:45.996 --> 34:47.476
Not old, McGee.

34:47.607 --> 34:49.391
Classics.

34:54.831 --> 34:57.225
Hey.
My heroes are back.

34:57.356 --> 34:58.270
Heroes?

34:58.400 --> 34:59.880
You got rid of our dirtbag.

35:00.010 --> 35:02.578
I might go back
- to selling ammo.
- Oh, happy day.

35:02.709 --> 35:04.537
Between us, he killed
that bouncer, didn't he?

35:04.667 --> 35:07.061
- Wouldn't surprise me.
- Actually, no.

35:07.192 --> 35:08.889
No, we, uh, we haven't
found the killer yet.

35:09.019 --> 35:10.934
Which is why we're here.

35:12.936 --> 35:14.808
Yeah, I don't like
the sound of that.

35:14.938 --> 35:16.288
I play by the rules.

35:16.418 --> 35:18.116
Keep immaculate records.

35:18.246 --> 35:19.769
I never sell to minors,
and I sure as hell

35:19.900 --> 35:21.075
never killed anybody.

35:21.206 --> 35:23.077
Relax, Pete.
We're looking for a gun.

35:23.208 --> 35:24.905
Familiar with the Walther PPK?

35:25.035 --> 35:27.386
Typical cops
wanting the James Bond special.

35:27.516 --> 35:29.083
They're hard to come by,

35:29.214 --> 35:30.693
and they cost
a pretty penny, too.

35:30.824 --> 35:31.738
Where do you keep yours?

35:31.868 --> 35:32.869
I don't keep mine anywhere.

35:33.000 --> 35:34.349
Sold it a few days ago.

35:36.656 --> 35:38.614
- Is that a crime?
- Who'd you sell it to?

35:38.745 --> 35:40.225
Oh, I forget his name.

35:40.355 --> 35:42.009
But he bought it here.

35:42.140 --> 35:44.272
Like I said...

35:44.403 --> 35:46.100
You keep
immaculate records.

35:48.058 --> 35:51.366
Right, right.
It was that bar owner.

35:54.935 --> 35:57.024
Careful, Harry.

35:58.025 --> 35:59.766
You heard him, Harry.

35:59.896 --> 36:01.289
He said be careful.

36:01.420 --> 36:03.509
Well, don't sneak up
on a guy like that.

36:03.639 --> 36:05.337
Now you got me all jumpy.

36:06.860 --> 36:09.471
You I know.
Who's this?

36:09.602 --> 36:12.866
This is Agent Torres.
He's here to be the bad cop.

36:12.996 --> 36:16.304
Well, in my defense, uh,
how bad is really up to you.

36:16.435 --> 36:18.176
Look familiar?

36:21.744 --> 36:23.790
Should it?

36:23.920 --> 36:27.228
This is the sales receipt
for the Walther PPK

36:27.359 --> 36:29.361
that you bought with cash
three days ago.

36:29.491 --> 36:30.927
Oh.

36:31.058 --> 36:32.538
That's-that's right.

36:32.668 --> 36:34.670
I, uh, I forgot. I met

36:34.801 --> 36:36.324
Peacekeeper at that trade show.

36:36.455 --> 36:39.501
I ended up buying that as
a wall decoration for my office.

36:39.632 --> 36:42.374
Oh, so we'll find it
hanging on your wall?

36:42.504 --> 36:45.942
No. No, I mean, uh,
y-you know, not-not yet. Uh,

36:46.073 --> 36:48.510
it's still at the framer
being mounted.

36:48.641 --> 36:50.904
Harry.

36:52.601 --> 36:54.603
The best bouncer you ever had?

36:56.170 --> 36:58.041
And my friend.

36:58.172 --> 36:59.608
So what happened?

37:01.175 --> 37:02.698
It was closing time.

37:02.829 --> 37:04.961
We had a few too many.

37:05.092 --> 37:06.789
And I-I...

37:07.790 --> 37:10.271
I tripped a wire in him
or something.

37:10.402 --> 37:12.926
Over what? Money?

37:13.056 --> 37:14.406
Or a woman?

37:14.536 --> 37:16.886
Over 300 bucks.

37:17.017 --> 37:18.845
The cover charge was short,

37:18.975 --> 37:22.240
and I made the mistake
of-of asking him about it,

37:22.370 --> 37:24.111
and I...

37:24.242 --> 37:27.549
He was-he was so angry.

37:27.680 --> 37:29.334
I got-I got scared.

37:29.464 --> 37:31.423
And I-I pulled the gun out
to try to snap him out of it.

37:31.553 --> 37:33.251
But it went off by itself.

37:33.381 --> 37:36.079
It seems like it. I...
We-we were so drunk.

37:36.210 --> 37:37.472
How did he end up at Gorton's?

37:37.603 --> 37:39.387
I was trying to save him.

37:39.518 --> 37:42.347
I was racing to the hospital,
begging him,

37:42.477 --> 37:43.826
"Hang in there, big guy."

37:43.957 --> 37:45.567
But he-he didn't.

37:45.698 --> 37:47.395
And the-the...

37:47.526 --> 37:51.225
the shooting range was, like,
a-a mile away or so, and...

37:51.356 --> 37:53.880
So you left him there
to get shot full of bullets.

37:54.010 --> 37:55.490
And you pointed us
in the direction

37:55.621 --> 37:57.318
of his gun-toting ex-wife.

37:57.449 --> 38:00.147
I panicked.
I'm so sorry.

38:00.278 --> 38:03.803
I panicked. I just...

38:03.933 --> 38:05.935
I'm so sorry.

38:10.070 --> 38:11.506
And to add insult to injury,

38:11.637 --> 38:13.247
Harry found the missing $300

38:13.378 --> 38:15.205
underneath his desk
the next morning.

38:15.336 --> 38:17.033
Which didn't help his hangover.

38:17.164 --> 38:18.774
I can now add
Harry to the list

38:18.905 --> 38:21.124
of people I wish
didn't have a gun.

38:21.255 --> 38:23.213
Yeah, I bet Harry
wishes that now, too.

38:23.344 --> 38:25.172
That's funny.
I was just talking to someone

38:25.303 --> 38:26.521
about people like that.

38:26.652 --> 38:27.783
Someone?

38:27.914 --> 38:29.350
Hey, Nick, did you ever, uh,

38:29.481 --> 38:30.786
get ahold of your car guy?

38:30.917 --> 38:33.006
That old car's
still on borrowed time.

38:33.136 --> 38:34.834
No, I did not,
but it's all good.

38:34.964 --> 38:37.227
I decided to take matters
into my own hands.

38:37.358 --> 38:39.447
Stella's coming home with me.

38:39.578 --> 38:40.970
Stella.

38:41.841 --> 38:43.408
You name your cars?

38:43.538 --> 38:45.105
Okay, let me guess.

38:45.235 --> 38:46.802
Old sweetheart?

38:46.933 --> 38:48.151
My very first.

38:48.282 --> 38:49.457
First girlfriend,

38:49.588 --> 38:50.980
first car.

38:51.111 --> 38:53.548
Yeah, I saved for, like,
two years to buy that car,

38:53.679 --> 38:55.507
and, uh, on my way
to Stella's,

38:55.637 --> 38:58.466
I get T-boned
by a pizza delivery truck.

38:58.597 --> 39:00.990
Why don't you
just name the car Domino?

39:01.121 --> 39:02.601
Did you get free pizzas
after that?

39:02.731 --> 39:04.864
Okay, all right,
you guys laugh now,

39:04.994 --> 39:06.039
but it was a tragic day

39:06.169 --> 39:07.432
which I can now make good

39:07.562 --> 39:10.565
by giving Stella
her groove back.

39:10.696 --> 39:12.088
Mm, but all those bullet holes.

39:12.219 --> 39:14.526
You weren't sure
you were gonna be able fix it.

39:14.656 --> 39:16.397
Now I'm thinking maybe I can.

39:18.878 --> 39:21.489
I could really use
a project like that right now.

39:23.012 --> 39:24.405
Like Gibbs and his boat.

39:24.536 --> 39:26.668
No, no, not like Gibbs
and his boat, okay?

39:26.799 --> 39:29.105
His boat was in a basement.
I think I'm gonna

39:29.236 --> 39:30.498
fix Stella in my garage.

39:30.629 --> 39:32.500
More like Chitty Bang Bang.

39:32.631 --> 39:34.763
Yeah, Parker, that's
what I'm talking about.

39:34.894 --> 39:37.200
Stella is like my
Chitty Bang Bang.

39:37.331 --> 39:40.290
That's my third childhood
reference in two days.

39:40.421 --> 39:42.380
- I better go for a checkup.
- Huh.

39:42.510 --> 39:45.470
Oh, I almost forgot. I'm gonna
be late tomorrow if that's okay.

39:45.600 --> 39:47.559
Sure. No worries.

39:48.603 --> 39:51.911
Chitty Bang Bang.

39:54.740 --> 39:56.132
Sheesh!

39:57.612 --> 39:59.440
- All right, you ready?
- Yeah. Hell, yeah.

39:59.571 --> 40:02.356
- Okay. Here we go.
- Okay.

40:02.487 --> 40:04.750
Watch that grip. Make
sure the master grip...

40:04.880 --> 40:06.839
Finger off the trigger
while I'm lining up the shot.

40:06.969 --> 40:08.971
Until you're
- ready to shoot.
- Okay.

40:09.102 --> 40:10.930
And forward-leaning stance
for more stability,

40:11.060 --> 40:13.672
and then breathe through
the trigger pull.

40:16.196 --> 40:18.459
Ooh! [exclaims] Oh!

40:18.590 --> 40:19.939
- You are a natural!
- Sheesh!

40:20.069 --> 40:22.115
- Ah!
- How does that feel?

40:22.245 --> 40:24.552
Uh, it...

40:24.683 --> 40:26.946
feels better than I thought
it would.

40:27.076 --> 40:30.471
So, which one of these is
- gonna go home with you?
- Uh...

40:34.867 --> 40:36.608
None of 'em.

40:36.738 --> 40:38.827
Really? You sure?

40:38.958 --> 40:41.656
Yeah. Yeah, I-I'm cool.

40:41.787 --> 40:43.310
I mean,
I wouldn't mind coming back

40:43.441 --> 40:44.659
to blow off steam
every now and then,

40:44.790 --> 40:46.400
though, if that's cool with you.

40:46.531 --> 40:49.795
- It is an open invitation.
- Hell yeah.
