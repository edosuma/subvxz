Ice Age
A Mammoth Christmas

00:46.666 --> 00:48.166
By Mikhel for Subtitulos.es
==SPREAD THE WORD==

00:48.258 --> 00:49.058
(SIGHING HAPPILY)

00:48.892 --> 00:48.958
(GASPS)

00:48.925 --> 00:48.958
(GROANS)

00:48.492 --> 00:48.791
(GRUNTS)

00:51.479 --> 00:53.664
Okay, Ellie, I got her.

00:53.732 --> 00:55.566
(GASPS) The Christmas rock.

00:55.634 --> 00:57.051
Just got her
out of storage.

00:57.119 --> 00:58.819
I wanted to surprise Peaches.

00:58.887 --> 01:01.188
Where is our sweet
little angel? Huh?

01:01.256 --> 01:03.741
Incoming! (LAUGHS)

01:03.809 --> 01:05.126
(GRUNTS)

01:05.193 --> 01:06.628
There's your
sweet little angel.

01:06.695 --> 01:07.678
Sorry, Dad.

01:07.745 --> 01:10.098
Yeah! Whoo-hoo!
It's on! (LAUGHS)

01:10.165 --> 01:13.217
You guys need
to chill out. (INHALES)

01:14.186 --> 01:15.086
(SCREAMS)

01:15.920 --> 01:17.455
(EXHALES)
ELLIE: Peaches.

01:17.789 --> 01:19.307
(GASPS) The Christmas rock!

01:19.375 --> 01:21.426
I love it! I love it!
I love it! I love it! I love it! (KISSES)

01:21.493 --> 01:23.478
No, no, no, don't.
(GROANS) Too late.

01:24.212 --> 01:25.846
(MUFFLED) I'm stuck.

01:26.448 --> 01:27.848
(GRUNTS)

01:27.916 --> 01:30.751
This is the same Christmas rock I had
when I was a kid.

01:30.819 --> 01:33.988
It's an heirloom that's been in our
family for generations.

01:34.056 --> 01:36.256
Tonight when Santa comes by
with his presents,

01:36.324 --> 01:41.062
he'll see this rock and know that
a very special little girl lives here.

01:41.129 --> 01:43.164
MANNY: ¶ Oh, Christmas rock,
oh, Christmas rock

01:43.232 --> 01:44.565
(GROANS)

01:44.649 --> 01:48.485
¶ You're 30 tons of granite
And every... ¶

01:48.553 --> 01:50.487
You know you're singing
to a rock, right?

01:50.555 --> 01:52.957
It's a Christmas
tradition for the kids.

01:53.025 --> 01:54.992
Don't sabers have
Christmas traditions?

01:55.060 --> 01:56.794
Oh, yeah!

01:56.861 --> 01:59.830
Every year my dad would bring home
the biggest, fattest gazelles he could find

01:59.898 --> 02:01.399
and then we'd
all rip into their...

02:01.466 --> 02:02.850
(CLEARS THROAT)

02:02.918 --> 02:04.585
(QUIVERS)

02:04.653 --> 02:05.636
...our presents.

02:05.703 --> 02:07.271
And we'd play games
with the gazelles

02:07.339 --> 02:09.957
and dance with them
and not eat them. The end.

02:10.025 --> 02:12.426
Merry Christmas,
my mammals.

02:12.494 --> 02:16.064
Wow!
That's some crazy rock.

02:16.014 --> 02:17.414
Step away from the stone.

02:17.482 --> 02:19.016
- Why?
- You'll break it.

02:19.317 --> 02:21.119
(LAUGHS)
Sid can't break a rock.

02:21.186 --> 02:22.686
Don't tempt him.

02:22.754 --> 02:25.323
Uncle Sid, we need this
so that Santa can find us tonight.

02:25.390 --> 02:27.825
What, this? Oh, pfft.

02:27.892 --> 02:29.794
(STUTTERS) He could
go right past it.

02:29.861 --> 02:32.847
You need something
bigger, taller, sparklier.

02:32.914 --> 02:34.982
Something with a pizzazz.

02:35.050 --> 02:36.634
Um, a tree!

02:37.319 --> 02:38.753
A Christmas tree?

02:38.820 --> 02:41.288
(SCOFFS) Do you know
how ridiculous that sounds?

02:41.356 --> 02:42.990
There's millions of
trees out there, Sid.

02:43.058 --> 02:44.759
How would anyone
notice this one?

02:44.827 --> 02:46.094
Well, we could
decorate it.

02:47.062 --> 02:47.945
Crash, Eddie.

02:48.013 --> 02:49.496
Whoo-hoo!
(LAUGHS)

02:49.564 --> 02:51.065
(SCATTING)

02:55.136 --> 02:56.470
Sweet!

02:56.538 --> 02:58.022
(LAUGHS)

02:58.056 --> 02:59.040
(GAGS)

03:04.679 --> 03:06.163
And,  voila!

03:07.098 --> 03:08.566
It does look pretty good.

03:08.634 --> 03:10.300
Ah, it'll never catch on.

03:10.152 --> 03:11.668
It's beautiful.

03:11.736 --> 03:14.956
Hmm. It needs a certain
razzle-dazzle on top.

03:15.023 --> 03:17.091
Something that says Sid.

03:17.158 --> 03:18.325
(GASPS)

03:21.529 --> 03:22.997
Ooh.

03:26.134 --> 03:29.837
And just like that,
a tradition is born.

03:30.138 --> 03:31.289
Huh?

03:32.057 --> 03:33.640
(ALL EXCLAIMING)

03:33.708 --> 03:34.875
Hey!

03:36.678 --> 03:37.511
(BOTH GASP)

03:37.579 --> 03:40.698
Seriously, what did
you think was gonna...

03:40.766 --> 03:43.000
Yep. That says
Sid, all right.

03:47.189 --> 03:49.106
(GROWLS)

03:49.174 --> 03:51.842
Okay, okay. Let's just
keep it together.

03:51.910 --> 03:54.862
It really is about
the spirit of Christmas, isn't it?

03:54.930 --> 03:57.564
You're about to be
a spirit of Christmas, Sid!

03:57.632 --> 03:59.783
Manny, please.
I'm so sorry.

03:59.835 --> 04:01.335
You know what, Sid,
I'm the least of your worries.

04:01.402 --> 04:03.171
You gotta answer to Santa.

04:03.238 --> 04:05.456
Santa? Santa Claus?

04:05.524 --> 04:07.642
He is never gonna
forgive this.

04:07.709 --> 04:10.061
You just got
yourself on Santa's...

04:10.128 --> 04:14.248
Uh, ah,
Santa's Naughty List.

04:14.315 --> 04:15.316
(GASPS)

04:15.384 --> 04:16.983
Santa has a Naughty List?

04:17.051 --> 04:18.485
Yeah! Yeah!

04:18.353 --> 04:21.555
And if you're not good,
then he puts your name on it.

04:21.622 --> 04:22.990
We're never good.

04:23.058 --> 04:24.258
Then why start now?

04:24.326 --> 04:25.109
(GROANS)

04:25.327 --> 04:26.961
Well, if your name's
on the Naughty List,

04:27.029 --> 04:29.764
you don't get Christmas.

04:29.831 --> 04:31.098
(GASPS)

04:31.165 --> 04:32.066
(GASPS)

04:32.134 --> 04:35.202
But no! Why me?

04:35.270 --> 04:37.821
Besides the fact
that it's my fault. (CHUCKLES)

04:37.889 --> 04:40.057
The Naughty List?
Where did you come up with that?

04:40.125 --> 04:43.093
Relax. Sid's gullible
but he's not that gullible.

04:43.161 --> 04:45.329
He knows this Santa
stuff is just for kids.

04:45.397 --> 04:47.998
What? You don't
believe in Santa?

04:47.883 --> 04:49.750
Um, I, well...

04:49.818 --> 04:51.418
Of course, he believes.

04:51.486 --> 04:53.821
That's the magic
of Christmas.

04:53.722 --> 04:56.907
If anyone deserves to be on the
naughty List, Dad, it's you!

04:57.960 --> 04:59.694
She sure told you,
didn't she?

04:59.761 --> 05:01.796
Well, too bad,
I'm a grown-up.

05:01.863 --> 05:04.031
Grown-ups don't believe
in the Naughty List.

05:04.098 --> 05:05.900
(SOBBING)

05:05.967 --> 05:08.402
I'm not getting Christmas.

05:08.469 --> 05:10.821
(INDISTINCT MUMBLING)

05:10.888 --> 05:12.022
Don't cry, Sid.

05:12.089 --> 05:12.991
Why not?

05:13.128 --> 05:14.858
Your tears are
freezing solid.

05:14.926 --> 05:16.026
Huh?

06:18.308 --> 06:19.591
(SCREAMS)

06:23.127 --> 06:25.496
Why am I on
Santa's Naughty List?

06:25.564 --> 06:26.881
Why? Why?

06:26.948 --> 06:30.117
My guess, because he doesn't
have a loser list.

06:30.185 --> 06:31.936
Well, thanks for
trying to cheer me up.

06:32.003 --> 06:33.370
I still feel terrible.

06:33.438 --> 06:34.772
Pull it together,
Uncle Sid.

06:34.840 --> 06:35.833
We've got work to do.

06:35.900 --> 06:37.407
But I'm still sulking.

06:37.475 --> 06:39.743
- No time.
- We're going to the Pole.

06:39.811 --> 06:40.728
The North one?

06:40.795 --> 06:42.129
Yep. We're gonna
find Santa

06:42.197 --> 06:44.298
so I can prove to my dad
that he's real.

06:44.366 --> 06:46.400
And we're gonna
get you off that list.

06:46.467 --> 06:47.568
And us, too!

06:47.636 --> 06:50.270
We may be naughty
but we still want Christmas.

06:50.272 --> 06:52.606
Peaches, honey,
you can't come with us.

06:52.674 --> 06:54.475
This is a very
dangerous journey.

06:54.542 --> 06:58.579
The North Pole is a desolate land
of ice and snow.

07:01.065 --> 07:02.816
This isn't exactly Miami.

07:02.667 --> 07:03.933
Come on, Uncle Sid,

07:04.001 --> 07:05.920
I want us all to have
Christmas together.

07:05.987 --> 07:07.388
Hmm. I don't know.

07:07.455 --> 07:10.090
It's wildly irresponsible and impulsive
but let's do it!

07:10.158 --> 07:11.325
Northward, ho!

07:11.392 --> 07:12.559
CRASH AND EDDIE:
Ho ho ho!

07:12.627 --> 07:16.730
(SIGHS) Uh, guys,
let's follow the northern lights.

07:16.798 --> 07:18.915
North. Get it?

07:18.983 --> 07:21.067
- Northward ho!
- Santa ho!

07:21.136 --> 07:22.769
Ho ho ho!

07:39.554 --> 07:42.773
Huh. I think we just
marched off the Earth.

07:42.607 --> 07:44.174
No, it's a white-out.

07:44.241 --> 07:45.943
We'll be safe
as long as we all...

07:46.711 --> 07:48.278
stay together.

07:48.345 --> 07:51.048
Peaches, where are you?

07:51.116 --> 07:52.766
- Uncle Sid?
- Peaches?

07:52.834 --> 07:54.468
- Uncle Sid?
- Peaches?

07:54.536 --> 07:55.870
Huh?

07:55.937 --> 07:59.840
Eddie? Where are you, Eddie?
Oh, wait. I'm Eddie.

08:36.527 --> 08:37.928
You're a reindeer.

08:37.796 --> 08:38.794
Yeah, I know.

08:38.863 --> 08:40.597
You can fly!

08:40.664 --> 08:41.465
I know!

08:41.532 --> 08:43.283
You're amazing!
I know!

08:43.351 --> 08:47.688
Check it out, Sauerkraut.
I can hover, roll and zing.

Prancer?

08:56.697 --> 08:58.381
(LAUGHING)

08:58.449 --> 08:59.482
It's a family name.

09:00.985 --> 09:03.420
You saved our lives

Are you sure you
don't need my help?

09:06.391 --> 09:08.175
Oh, no thank you.
You've done more than enough.

09:08.243 --> 09:09.677
Look, we'll take
it from here. (SCREAMS)

You want an honest answer

09:19.804 --> 09:21.738
Uh, Christmas answer.

Huh?

09:25.193 --> 09:27.277
Have you seen Peaches?
I can't find her anywhere.

09:27.479 --> 09:29.530
And Sid, Crash and
Eddie are gone, too!

09:29.597 --> 09:31.064
Last I saw them,
they were trying to figure out

09:31.132 --> 09:32.566
how to get off
Santa's Naughty List.

09:32.934 --> 09:34.734
What Naughty List?
I made it up!

09:34.802 --> 09:35.802
We gotta find them.

09:35.870 --> 09:38.038
Diego, can you pick
up Sid's scent?

09:38.105 --> 09:39.940
I can but it makes

take us to get to the, uh, North Pole?

Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
You can't walk to the North Pole.

09:54.822 --> 09:56.123
It's too far.

09:56.190 --> 10:00.010
But I can fly you there.
No sweat, on Air Prancer.

10:00.078 --> 10:01.378
Oh, oh, no,
we couldn't.

10:01.446 --> 10:03.229
No, no, no, no.
My family raised me

10:03.298 --> 10:06.466
to be good to strangers and there's
really no one stranger than you guys.
