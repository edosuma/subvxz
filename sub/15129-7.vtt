00:38.605 --> 00:40.890
(Alex) I will go in from
the top left of your belly.

00:40.924 --> 00:42.925
The leiomyoma is
on the wall of your bowel,

00:42.943 --> 00:45.561
and since it's small,
I will remove it laparoscopically.

00:45.595 --> 00:48.480
<i>(Charlie) We take pains to be clear
with our patients...</i>

00:48.532 --> 00:51.400
<i>what we're going to do,
what might go wrong...</i>

00:51.434 --> 00:54.203
<i>all to explain
why we're touching them.</i>

00:54.237 --> 00:56.872
<i>We spend our days touching people.</i>

00:56.907 --> 01:00.409
And we'll also have to remove
a small segment of your jejunum,

01:00.443 --> 01:02.711
and then I will staple the ends together,

01:02.746 --> 01:04.547
but that is normal for this procedure.

01:04.581 --> 01:05.581
- Normal?
- (Alex) Yes.

01:05.615 --> 01:06.832
Mom, please don't harass Dr. Reid.

01:06.883 --> 01:08.801
I'm not harassing her. I just want to know

01:08.835 --> 01:10.786
everything there is to know
about your surgery.

01:10.804 --> 01:12.421
I'm so sorry, Dr. Reid.

01:12.455 --> 01:14.623
Totally fine. Now is the time
to ask me anything.

01:14.659 --> 01:16.291
Whoa. (chuckles) Wrong thing to say.

01:16.309 --> 01:18.344
Sandhya keeps saying
that she's got a tumor

01:18.395 --> 01:19.845
but that it's not cancer.

01:19.896 --> 01:23.632
Now is this true, or is she just
saying that so I won't worry?

01:23.650 --> 01:28.320
Leiomyomas are rarely cancerous,
but after we remove the tumor,

01:28.355 --> 01:32.140
we will examine it under
a microscope and make 100% sure.

01:32.158 --> 01:33.943
Well, we've planned
a pre-wedding celebration

01:33.977 --> 01:35.778
for Sandhya, a <i>puja,</i>

01:35.812 --> 01:37.479
but it's next weekend,
and I'm worried that

01:37.497 --> 01:39.531
she won't be healed from
the surgery by then.

01:39.583 --> 01:41.333
Well, since we are going
in laparoscopically,

01:41.368 --> 01:43.869
she will be able to go
home by the end of the day.

01:43.920 --> 01:46.655
Sandhya Ahuja?

01:46.673 --> 01:47.790
Yeah.

01:47.824 --> 01:48.874
This is Victor.

01:48.925 --> 01:50.492
He'll prep you for your surgery,

01:50.510 --> 01:51.827
and then I'll see you in there.

01:51.845 --> 01:54.263
Okay. (sighs)

01:54.297 --> 01:56.715
Come with me. Right through here.

01:56.766 --> 01:57.550
How are you doing today?

01:57.550 --> 01:59.217
As soon as I'm finished,
I'll come and talk to you.

01:59.269 --> 02:00.469
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

02:00.503 --> 02:02.104
She's gonna be fine, mom. She'll be fine.

02:04.441 --> 02:05.391
Hi. What's up?

02:05.442 --> 02:06.558
Hey, I was looking for you.

02:06.610 --> 02:08.360
I'm booked solid, back-to-back surgeries,

02:08.395 --> 02:10.529
and I need a favor.

02:10.562 --> 02:12.514
- Another favor.
- Shoot.

02:12.532 --> 02:14.617
I am bringing in a masseuse
today to see Charlie.

02:14.651 --> 02:15.651
Ooh, a masseuse.

02:15.685 --> 02:16.652
Her name's Ashley.

02:16.686 --> 02:17.820
Ooh. Ashley. (chuckles)

02:17.854 --> 02:19.354
I know. Sounds like a blonde.

02:19.372 --> 02:20.489
With a D-cup and braces.

02:20.523 --> 02:21.624
Charlie wishes.

02:21.658 --> 02:22.875
Anyway, the reason I'm bringing her in is

02:22.909 --> 02:25.193
because she works with coma patients.

02:25.211 --> 02:27.296
Don't judge.

02:27.330 --> 02:28.363
No. Every little bit helps.

02:28.381 --> 02:29.632
So do you mind keeping an eye out for her

02:29.666 --> 02:31.033
and buzz me when she gets here?

02:31.051 --> 02:32.034
- Sure.
- Great.

02:32.052 --> 02:33.168
(lowered voice) Here comes trouble.

02:34.704 --> 02:36.371
Dawn.

02:36.389 --> 02:37.372
Alex, hi.

02:37.390 --> 02:38.507
- Hi.
- Hi.

02:38.541 --> 02:40.876
Uh, I'm sorry for just dropping in.

02:40.894 --> 02:43.429
I'm here for a new vascular
methodology conference.

02:43.480 --> 02:45.380
Oh. Well, do you want to see Charlie?

02:45.398 --> 02:46.515
Is that okay?

02:46.549 --> 02:49.485
Of course. He'd be happy you were here.

02:49.519 --> 02:52.521
(indistinct conversations,
telephone rings in distance)

03:03.583 --> 03:05.501
(sirens wailing)

03:05.535 --> 03:06.902
So how are you feeling?

03:06.920 --> 03:09.672
Feeling like crap is how I'm feeling.

03:09.706 --> 03:11.373
Almost passed out on the way down here.

03:11.407 --> 03:13.408
You been drinking?

03:13.426 --> 03:15.344
It's 10:00 in the morning.

03:15.378 --> 03:16.979
Taking drugs.

03:17.013 --> 03:19.414
No.

03:19.432 --> 03:21.416
I am not taking any drugs.

03:21.434 --> 03:22.434
Oh. All right.

03:22.469 --> 03:23.635
Well, we'll get a nurse down here.

03:23.687 --> 03:24.837
She'll take your temperature
and blood pressure.

03:24.871 --> 03:26.889
I'm sure it's just the flu.

03:26.923 --> 03:29.591
It's not the flu.

03:29.609 --> 03:31.060
These are infected!

03:31.094 --> 03:32.594
What are your horns made of?

03:32.612 --> 03:35.481
Silicone implants.

03:35.532 --> 03:37.599
They'll be harder and twice
as long when I'm done.

03:37.617 --> 03:40.202
(chuckles) I bet you say
that to all the gals.

03:40.236 --> 03:41.403
Do you mind if I touch them?

03:41.437 --> 03:43.405
No.

03:43.439 --> 03:45.207
Look, I know what's wrong,

03:45.241 --> 03:47.209
so could you just give
me some antibiotics,

03:47.243 --> 03:48.610
and I'll get out of here?

03:48.628 --> 03:51.547
Actually, I think you may
need more than antibiotics.

03:51.581 --> 03:52.915
Just wait here, okay?

03:52.949 --> 03:55.617
Okay.

03:55.635 --> 03:56.618
He's not better.

03:56.636 --> 03:58.170
(Alex) He's not worse.

03:58.221 --> 04:01.456
No, you're not understanding me.
He's not getting better.

04:01.474 --> 04:03.609
Alex, don't react.
Just take a deep breath.

04:03.643 --> 04:06.095
What do you want me to say?
I come in here every morning,

04:06.129 --> 04:08.180
hoping today's the day he wakes up.

04:08.231 --> 04:10.682
- He had pneumonia?
- Yes, and he beat it.

04:10.734 --> 04:13.569
Is this the lost soul?

04:13.603 --> 04:15.971
The man I'm here to work my magic on?

04:15.989 --> 04:17.305
(case clatters, latches click) To, uh...

04:17.322 --> 04:19.274
bring back from the brink?

04:19.308 --> 04:21.976
This guy's not touching me.
D-don't let that happen.

04:21.995 --> 04:22.978
<i>You're</i> Ashley?

04:22.996 --> 04:25.247
You were expecting a lady.

04:25.281 --> 04:26.331
That's a common mistake.

04:26.366 --> 04:28.483
Ashley.

04:28.501 --> 04:30.035
What's the guitar for?

04:30.086 --> 04:31.537
Well, music is freedom.

04:31.588 --> 04:32.955
(strums chords)

04:32.989 --> 04:34.990
Okay, okay. We're just in
the middle of something.

04:35.008 --> 04:36.708
Could you just give us
a couple of minutes?

04:36.760 --> 04:38.594
Oh. My time is your money.

04:38.628 --> 04:39.595
Thank you.

04:39.629 --> 04:42.498
♪

04:42.532 --> 04:44.683
(singing indistinctly)

04:44.717 --> 04:46.718
(sighs) Coma arousal therapy.

04:46.770 --> 04:48.387
You're the one that suggested it.

04:48.438 --> 04:50.005
Where did you find him, clown school?

04:50.023 --> 04:51.640
Well, he was highly recommended.

04:51.674 --> 04:54.276
You know what? I don't know why
I'm explaining myself to you.

04:54.310 --> 04:55.778
You're not the one here every day.

04:55.812 --> 04:57.980
Exactly. I have perspective,

04:58.014 --> 05:02.484
and what I see...
and I am not attacking you...

05:02.518 --> 05:05.454
what I see is that
Charlie is not waking up.

05:05.488 --> 05:07.706
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

05:07.740 --> 05:08.957
He will.

05:14.080 --> 05:15.831
I have to get back to my conference.

05:18.218 --> 05:20.869
It was nice seeing you, Alex.

05:27.260 --> 05:30.646
Don't doubt yourself.
You know me better than anyone.

05:30.680 --> 05:31.930
(sighs) I'm right...

05:32.932 --> 05:34.600
here.

05:35.852 --> 05:37.552
We're giving you some medication, Sandhya.

05:37.570 --> 05:39.354
It'll make you very sleepy.

05:39.388 --> 05:41.023
Okay.

05:41.057 --> 05:43.859
(monitor beeping steadily)

05:43.893 --> 05:46.528
And this is just oxygen.

05:46.562 --> 05:48.530
(ventilator hissing)

05:48.564 --> 05:51.700
Wow. (chuckles) Wow.

05:51.734 --> 05:54.069
- Hey, Dr. Reid?
- Mm-hmm?

05:54.087 --> 05:55.454
Are you married?

05:55.488 --> 05:57.673
I'm engaged, actually.

05:57.707 --> 05:59.875
- Me, too.
- I heard. Congratulations.

05:59.909 --> 06:02.544
Yeah. Sanjay.

06:02.578 --> 06:04.463
He looks like Hrithik Roshan.

06:04.514 --> 06:07.549
(chuckles) Bollywood star. Gorgeous.

06:07.583 --> 06:10.385
Sandhya, can you count down
from ten for me, please?

06:10.419 --> 06:14.556
Uh... ten... mm...

06:14.590 --> 06:16.308
She's out. Sevoflurane.

06:24.934 --> 06:26.201
(vaporizer hisses) Done.

06:26.236 --> 06:28.203
Okay.

06:28.238 --> 06:29.938
Let's take this girl's tumor out,

06:29.956 --> 06:32.107
get her the temple on time.

06:35.295 --> 06:37.829
Bowel looks good.

06:37.881 --> 06:39.781
Tissue's clean.

06:39.799 --> 06:42.617
No sign of any other tumor.

06:42.635 --> 06:46.088
We'll have eyes on this
in just a sec here.

06:46.122 --> 06:47.956
(monitor beeping rapidly) Status?

06:47.974 --> 06:50.008
- Blood pressure rising.
- Body temp?

06:50.059 --> 06:51.560
Rising as well. 103.

06:51.594 --> 06:54.563
C.O.2 65. Blood pressure 150/100.

06:54.597 --> 06:56.565
We need to hyperventilate.
I'm removing the ports.

06:56.599 --> 06:59.601
Turning her off the gas.
Giving her 100% oxygen. (beep)

06:59.635 --> 07:01.403
Put her on a propofol drip.

07:01.437 --> 07:02.404
Temp?

07:02.438 --> 07:03.906
Still rising. 104.

07:03.940 --> 07:05.774
- We need to bring it down.
- Peak "T" wave on the E.C.G.

07:05.808 --> 07:07.943
Too much potassium.
It's malignant hyperthermia.

07:07.977 --> 07:09.194
Get me the M.H. kit.

07:09.245 --> 07:10.696
She needs dantrolene, cooling blankets.

07:10.747 --> 07:12.531
Suture gun now. (beep)

07:12.582 --> 07:14.249
(clicks)

07:14.284 --> 07:16.868
Okay. Patient's convulsing.
We've got an emergency.

07:16.920 --> 07:19.288
- Everybody, move now.
- Yep.

07:19.322 --> 07:21.373
Got it? She needs the dantrolene.

07:21.424 --> 07:23.992
We've got to get her temp
down or she's gonna arrest.

07:24.010 --> 07:25.994
Bolus her with cool saline.

07:26.012 --> 07:28.931
She's on fire. Come on, Sandhya.

07:28.965 --> 07:30.766
What's happening with my M.H. kit?!

07:30.800 --> 07:32.768
- I've gotta mix it, doctor. I'm on it.
- Can't you go any faster?!

07:32.802 --> 07:35.170
No. Shut up so we can concentrate. Ohh.

07:35.188 --> 07:36.271
What's going on?

07:36.306 --> 07:37.889
An adverse reaction to the anesthetic.

07:37.941 --> 07:39.024
It wasn't in her file.

07:39.058 --> 07:40.175
We have dantrolene going
through her system,

07:40.193 --> 07:41.276
but we need the temperature to go down.

07:41.311 --> 07:42.277
Is it?

07:42.312 --> 07:43.528
Uh... temp falling. 102.9.

07:43.563 --> 07:44.529
It's gotta drop faster.

07:44.564 --> 07:46.281
Come on. Come on. Come on!

07:46.316 --> 07:49.234
Temp 102.8. 102.7.

07:49.285 --> 07:51.320
- Good. C.O.2?
- 50 and dropping.

07:51.354 --> 07:52.687
"T" waves are normalizing.

07:52.705 --> 07:53.789
Pupil activity. Come on, come on, come on.

07:53.823 --> 07:55.207
We got it.

07:55.241 --> 07:58.577
That's great news,
if you didn't cook her brain.

07:58.628 --> 08:00.579
(sighs)

08:02.659 --> 08:05.258
She only had local anesthetics
in her history, no general.

08:05.292 --> 08:07.076
No family history of
malignant hyperthermia.

08:07.094 --> 08:09.178
Why'd it take so long to
get her on the dantrolene?

08:09.213 --> 08:10.213
We moved as fast as we could.

08:10.247 --> 08:11.414
Yeah, so why isn't she waking up?

08:11.432 --> 08:13.800
Get her up to the I.C.U.
Have Shahir take a look.

08:13.851 --> 08:15.051
What do we tell her family?

08:15.085 --> 08:16.269
We tell them what we know,
that she had a reaction

08:16.303 --> 08:17.353
to the anesthetic. She's unconscious.

08:17.388 --> 08:18.855
Yeah, but her pupils are reactive.

08:18.889 --> 08:20.773
They're tracking to stimuli,
and that's very good news.

08:20.808 --> 08:23.009
- Reid, you're not a neurologist.
- I know that,

08:23.043 --> 08:24.844
but I don't want to
frighten Sandhya's family

08:24.878 --> 08:26.145
before we know what's going on for sure.

08:26.180 --> 08:28.047
And I don't want to give 'em false hope.

08:28.082 --> 08:30.733
We can't wake her up,
and that's not good, okay?

08:30.767 --> 08:32.434
(monitor beeping steadily)

08:32.453 --> 08:35.438
(sighs)

08:46.884 --> 08:48.868
Okay. Let's try 45 across.

08:48.902 --> 08:50.837
Okay. (speaks indistinctly)

08:50.888 --> 08:52.555
I, uh... I don't know.

08:52.589 --> 08:53.789
I don't... I don't know that one.

08:55.759 --> 08:57.226
What's wrong?

08:57.261 --> 08:58.478
(telephone rings in distance)

08:59.038 --> 09:01.064
We believe Sandhya had
a reaction to her anesthetic.

09:01.098 --> 09:03.266
I wasn't able to finish the surgery.

09:03.300 --> 09:04.817
Is she okay?

09:04.852 --> 09:06.135
She's stable now.

09:06.153 --> 09:07.970
We're sending her for more tests.

09:07.988 --> 09:10.073
Uh, c... um, can we see her?

09:10.107 --> 09:12.075
Not yet. She's unconscious.

09:12.109 --> 09:13.976
(sighs, voice breaks)
This isn't happening.

09:13.994 --> 09:16.913
Mrs. Ahuja, in a situation like this,

09:16.947 --> 09:19.916
things can change minute by minute,

09:19.950 --> 09:22.919
and depending on what we discover,

09:22.953 --> 09:25.505
I promise, there's no reason
why Sandhya won't wake up

09:25.539 --> 09:27.990
and walk out of here today, okay?

09:28.008 --> 09:29.342
Listen to her, mom, okay?
She's the doctor.

09:29.376 --> 09:32.261
She, um, she knows what she's saying.

09:32.296 --> 09:34.464
Dr. Reid.

09:34.498 --> 09:38.351
(indistinct conversations)

09:38.385 --> 09:41.304
I will come and find you as
soon as we know anything.

09:41.338 --> 09:42.505
Okay.

09:42.523 --> 09:45.525
(telephone ringing in distance)

09:48.562 --> 09:51.981
(lowered voice) Less is more, Reid.

09:52.015 --> 09:55.034
So you realize these kinds of
implants are illegal, right?

09:55.068 --> 09:56.903
Could you just give me something for 'em,

09:56.954 --> 09:58.521
and I'll get out of here?

09:58.539 --> 10:00.189
We're just awaiting the
results of your blood test.

10:00.207 --> 10:02.191
It'll be any minute now.

10:02.209 --> 10:03.242
So where'd you get these done?

10:03.293 --> 10:04.460
I own my own tattoo parlor.

10:04.495 --> 10:05.711
Mm-hmm.

10:05.746 --> 10:08.164
Everything from belly
buttons to prince Alberts.

10:08.198 --> 10:09.632
- You know what that is?
- Yes, I do.

10:09.666 --> 10:11.250
It's a ring through the
glans of the penis.

10:11.301 --> 10:15.254
Five years now I've had
my business, no problems.

10:15.305 --> 10:18.541
Everything you see here...
did it all myself.

10:18.559 --> 10:20.309
So you put these horns in your own head.

10:20.344 --> 10:22.261
How do you deal with the anesthetic?

10:22.312 --> 10:24.430
I don't use it. It's too dangerous.

10:24.481 --> 10:25.982
Okay, so, Barry, is it?

10:26.016 --> 10:26.983
It's Karn, actually.

10:27.017 --> 10:29.519
Okay, Karn, what you have here is

10:29.553 --> 10:31.938
two transdermal implants gone awry.

10:31.989 --> 10:34.223
The source of the contamination
is possibly the knife

10:34.241 --> 10:38.077
you used to cut your own skin,
or it's the implants themselves.

10:38.111 --> 10:39.362
Diagnosis, Dr. Lin?

10:39.396 --> 10:40.413
- Cellulitis.
- At the very least,

10:40.447 --> 10:42.365
but my concern is osteomyelitis.

10:42.399 --> 10:44.066
What's that?

10:44.101 --> 10:46.202
It's an infection of the bone.
Now we'll need to get a C.T.

10:46.236 --> 10:49.222
to see if the cranial vault
has been compromised.

10:49.256 --> 10:50.339
Compromised how?

10:50.374 --> 10:53.342
The infection could be eroding your skull.

10:53.377 --> 10:54.961
You want to take off my horns.

10:55.012 --> 10:56.929
- If I have to, yeah.
- No way. (sighs)

10:56.964 --> 10:59.131
It took me a year of work to build 'em up.

10:59.183 --> 11:02.635
Well, it's your decision,
but if it is osteomyelitis,

11:02.686 --> 11:04.937
then all those nasty germs
could go from your skull

11:04.972 --> 11:06.973
into your brain, and if that happens,

11:07.024 --> 11:10.526
then you're facing meningitis,
brain abscess, possible death.

11:10.561 --> 11:11.527
But we won't know without a C.T.,

11:11.562 --> 11:13.479
so first things first, okay?

11:13.530 --> 11:16.449
(sighs) Yeah.

11:18.819 --> 11:20.119
(lowered voice) You might want
to talk to your friend Gavin

11:20.153 --> 11:21.437
about a psych consult.

11:21.455 --> 11:24.240
I have a feeling that Damien
is gonna resist treatment.

11:24.274 --> 11:27.076
That's not his name. It's Karn.

11:27.110 --> 11:30.112
"Karn" is not his name, either.

11:32.132 --> 11:34.383
(curtain rings swoosh)

11:34.418 --> 11:35.885
You're a shrink?

11:35.919 --> 11:39.589
(chuckles) I prefer
"psychiatrist," but yeah.

11:39.623 --> 11:41.424
Unbelievable.

11:41.458 --> 11:45.344
I come here for help,
and they send me you.

11:45.395 --> 11:48.231
Dr. Goran is worried
that you don't want to be treated.

11:48.265 --> 11:50.233
Treated how? Treated like a freak?

11:50.267 --> 11:51.567
'Cause you guys...

11:51.602 --> 11:53.736
you guys are knocking it out
of the park on that one.

11:53.770 --> 11:55.855
I just want to ask you a few questions.

11:55.906 --> 11:56.856
Is that all right?

11:56.907 --> 11:58.374
Okay. Great.

11:58.408 --> 12:01.861
(chair wheels rattle) So, Karn, uh,

12:01.912 --> 12:04.647
tell me, when did you
start modifying your body?

12:04.665 --> 12:09.118
I got my first tattoo at 13,

12:09.152 --> 12:13.039
my first piercing at, uh, 16.

12:13.090 --> 12:15.007
And you did most of this yourself?

12:15.042 --> 12:18.210
Yeah, but I'm trained to do it,

12:18.245 --> 12:20.713
like you're trained to do... this.

12:20.764 --> 12:23.366
It must've been painful.

12:23.400 --> 12:25.768
Most reasonable people shy away from pain.

12:25.802 --> 12:27.136
Pain's an attitude.

12:27.170 --> 12:28.938
If you have a goal, you get over it.

12:28.972 --> 12:30.673
What's your goal?

12:30.691 --> 12:32.525
You wouldn't get it.

12:32.559 --> 12:33.643
Try me.

12:39.349 --> 12:44.153
I have a dream of what I want to be.

12:44.187 --> 12:46.038
I want to take what's on the inside,

12:46.073 --> 12:48.023
and I want to put it on the outside.

12:48.041 --> 12:51.961
I want to mark <i>my</i> body
with my identity,

12:51.995 --> 12:53.529
with my story.

12:53.547 --> 12:55.915
Hmm.

12:55.966 --> 12:58.033
What story is this one telling?

12:58.051 --> 12:59.969
I got that one when my dad passed,

13:00.003 --> 13:02.805
to mark it, to help me grieve.

13:02.839 --> 13:03.973
It's a pretty dark image.

13:04.007 --> 13:06.642
Yeah, well, my dad was a pretty hard guy.

13:06.677 --> 13:07.876
He was military.

13:07.894 --> 13:09.595
Was he abusive?

13:09.646 --> 13:13.482
No. My dad did not abuse me.

13:13.517 --> 13:15.351
He just didn't like me.

13:15.385 --> 13:19.605
I'm just trying to understand you, Karn.

13:19.656 --> 13:21.190
You operate on your body continually.

13:21.224 --> 13:24.877
So what? It's my body.

13:24.911 --> 13:27.446
(chuckles and sighs)

13:27.497 --> 13:29.415
Skydiving is dangerous.

13:29.449 --> 13:33.235
Car racing. Smoking. Eating fast food.

13:33.270 --> 13:35.287
The people that do all those things...

13:35.339 --> 13:36.872
are they crazy, too?

13:36.907 --> 13:40.126
Hmm. All right. (scribbles)

13:40.177 --> 13:41.910
(papers rustle)
Well, thanks for talking to me, Karn.

13:41.928 --> 13:42.962
(pen clicks) I think we're done.

13:43.013 --> 13:44.246
Great.

13:44.264 --> 13:45.881
Go tell the surgeon to cut
out the freak's horns.

13:45.915 --> 13:47.183
Actually, I'm gonna tell Dr. Goran

13:47.217 --> 13:48.584
that you're as sane as any of us.

13:48.602 --> 13:51.253
Good luck.

13:53.557 --> 13:56.559
In Charlie's chart, it says
he has no response to stimuli.

13:56.593 --> 13:58.728
Not that I've seen.

13:58.762 --> 14:01.764
So he's in a persistent vegetative state.

14:01.782 --> 14:04.433
That's not a term I use.

14:04.451 --> 14:06.101
You know, there have
been hundreds of studies

14:06.119 --> 14:07.436
on coma patients, Dr. Bell,

14:07.454 --> 14:09.538
and we still don't understand why

14:09.573 --> 14:11.440
one wakes up and one doesn't.

14:11.458 --> 14:14.276
Okay, but... in your opinion?

14:15.720 --> 14:18.947
Charlie's chances of recovery
are small but not impossible.

14:18.965 --> 14:20.583
So he could stay like this forever?

14:20.617 --> 14:23.636
Yes. Or he could wake up.

14:23.670 --> 14:25.120
Or he could suffer from a bed sore,

14:25.138 --> 14:26.422
turn septic, and die.

14:26.456 --> 14:27.556
We just don't know.

14:27.591 --> 14:29.341
Shahir, I need you to look me in the eye

14:29.393 --> 14:31.510
and tell me that you think
Charlie will wake up.

14:31.561 --> 14:34.063
Alex is committed to Charlie's recovery.

14:34.097 --> 14:36.932
I'm not talking about Alex.
I'm talking about you.

14:36.966 --> 14:38.734
Well, I can't answer that. Sorry.

14:38.769 --> 14:40.236
(indistinct conversations)

14:40.270 --> 14:41.854
Where are you going with this, Dawn?

14:43.440 --> 14:46.025
This isn't about you anymore.

14:47.244 --> 14:48.744
Stay out of it.

14:48.779 --> 14:52.281
Hello? Hello? (gasps)

14:52.315 --> 14:54.983
No one can see me or hear me. Can you?

14:55.001 --> 14:56.285
Yeah.

14:56.319 --> 14:57.953
(panting) Ohh. Thank god.

14:57.987 --> 14:59.505
Thank god.

14:59.539 --> 15:01.340
Hi. (chuckles)

15:05.021 --> 15:07.449
Hmm. I've seen this before.

15:07.483 --> 15:10.285
A teen I treated with blunt force trauma

15:10.319 --> 15:11.803
after a skiing accident.

15:11.838 --> 15:12.871
No brain stem damage

15:12.905 --> 15:16.208
and normal brain and pupil activity.

15:16.242 --> 15:17.358
We couldn't wake him.

15:17.376 --> 15:18.543
So you don't actually have a prognosis.

15:18.578 --> 15:20.045
Well, the next 48 hours are critical.

15:20.079 --> 15:22.080
Come on. You can say that
about every critical patient.

15:22.131 --> 15:24.199
You can't give us something
a little more concrete?

15:24.217 --> 15:26.334
Unless she crashes or wakes,
it's a waiting game.

15:26.368 --> 15:27.335
And there's nothing we can do?

15:27.369 --> 15:28.637
- No.
- My office in 15.

15:28.671 --> 15:29.805
We'll tell the family what we know,

15:29.839 --> 15:32.373
which, unfortunately, isn't much.

15:32.391 --> 15:35.093
(monitor beeping rhythmically,
ventilator hissing)

15:35.144 --> 15:37.145
I am so sorry.

15:37.180 --> 15:40.715
It isn't your fault, Alex.
It's a rare reaction.

15:40.733 --> 15:42.267
I know that,

15:42.318 --> 15:44.736
but she's about to get married,
and she's too young for this.

15:44.770 --> 15:46.488
I can't just stand by and wait.

15:46.522 --> 15:47.823
Sometimes all we can do is wait.

15:47.857 --> 15:51.276
You tell that to her family.

15:56.833 --> 16:00.285
Kinda want to jump back into it, don't ya?

16:03.956 --> 16:08.293
Just get back into your body
and make yourself wake up.

16:09.629 --> 16:12.714
No, actually.

16:12.748 --> 16:15.083
I'm in no rush.

16:18.421 --> 16:22.590
♪ you are my chi ♪

16:22.608 --> 16:26.895
♪ you are my energy ♪

16:26.929 --> 16:32.734
♪ you are my chi ♪

16:32.768 --> 16:34.486
Yeah. You have to fire him.

16:34.537 --> 16:36.821
I know.

16:36.873 --> 16:38.323
Mel, the woman in room 304...

16:38.374 --> 16:39.574
Yeah, she was your patient. I know.

16:39.608 --> 16:41.243
I want to know about any
change in her status,

16:41.277 --> 16:43.078
no matter how small, okay?

16:43.112 --> 16:44.546
I'm your I.C.U. spy. (chuckles)

16:44.580 --> 16:46.748
First Charlie. Now the new girl.

16:46.782 --> 16:48.583
Has Dawn been back to see Charlie?

16:48.617 --> 16:49.751
- No.
- Good.

16:49.785 --> 16:50.952
If she does, don't let her in.

16:50.970 --> 16:52.420
She doesn't have my permission.

16:52.454 --> 16:54.389
- Got it.
- Thanks.

16:54.423 --> 16:58.626
♪ you are my chi ♪

16:58.644 --> 17:00.478
I know he's flaky...

17:00.513 --> 17:01.629
Mm-hmm.

17:01.647 --> 17:03.265
And I will hand him his pink slip.

17:03.299 --> 17:05.183
I will...

17:05.217 --> 17:07.736
but just not right now, okay?

17:07.770 --> 17:09.637
I kinda find it...

17:09.655 --> 17:12.523
comforting that someone
is here with Charlie

17:12.575 --> 17:14.693
when I can't be.

17:14.743 --> 17:19.314
♪ you are my energy ♪

17:19.332 --> 17:23.867
♪ you are my chi ♪

17:23.920 --> 17:25.420

17:25.454 --> 17:26.988
(sighs)

17:27.006 --> 17:29.541
Uh, so this is another hallway.

17:29.592 --> 17:31.760
People kinda pass through here

17:31.794 --> 17:34.629
on their way to... other places.

17:34.664 --> 17:37.098
(laughs) It may be boring for you,

17:37.133 --> 17:39.467
but I am happy to have a break.

17:39.501 --> 17:42.270
(chuckles)
You're taking this really, really well.

17:43.940 --> 17:45.890
Listen, I-I don't wanna burst your bubble,

17:45.942 --> 17:48.176
but you might not...

17:48.194 --> 17:49.344
I might die?

17:49.362 --> 17:50.645
Yeah.

17:50.679 --> 17:52.447
And you're right.

17:52.481 --> 17:57.819
I guess I should be scared
or weirded out, but I'm not.

17:57.853 --> 18:01.656
Maybe it's because I'm hindu,
and I believe in reincarnation.

18:01.690 --> 18:02.741
So you're not afraid of dying?

18:02.792 --> 18:04.909
(sighs) My dad passed away,

18:04.961 --> 18:07.295
and the only thing that
helped me through was

18:07.330 --> 18:10.632
the thought that I would
be with him again,

18:10.666 --> 18:13.969
maybe on an astral plane, maybe back here.

18:14.003 --> 18:17.038
Okay, what do <i>you</i> think
happens after we die?

18:17.056 --> 18:19.707
Uh, what happens when we die?

18:19.725 --> 18:22.043
Um... (sighs)

18:22.061 --> 18:24.712
Nothing. We, uh, we die.
We go in the ground.

18:24.730 --> 18:26.547
That's it. Game over.

18:26.565 --> 18:29.050
That's science, and I'm, uh, I'm a doctor.

18:29.068 --> 18:31.386
I can tell you exactly
how the human body works.

18:31.404 --> 18:33.071
I'm not talking about the body.

18:33.105 --> 18:34.272
No, you're talking about the soul...

18:34.323 --> 18:36.107
electrical synapses in the brain,

18:36.158 --> 18:38.893
yada yada yada. Uh, more science.

18:38.911 --> 18:41.863
So then how am I standing
here and talking to you?

18:41.897 --> 18:45.533
See, I haven't quite
figured that part out yet.

18:45.567 --> 18:48.453
That's my point.

18:50.572 --> 18:51.539
Hey.

18:51.573 --> 18:53.741
Hey. So I finished my evaluation.

18:53.759 --> 18:54.959
Mm-hmm.

18:55.011 --> 18:56.678
Karn isn't delusional
or even body dysmorphic.

18:56.712 --> 18:58.763
Well, he's definitely not normal.

18:58.798 --> 19:00.432
See, that's the thing, Joel.

19:00.466 --> 19:02.517
You may not like the patient's choices,

19:02.551 --> 19:04.803
but he's a sane and
competent decision-maker.

19:04.854 --> 19:06.354
Great. Well, his skull's still infected,

19:06.389 --> 19:09.974
and he might get septicemia,
so the horns have to come off.

19:10.026 --> 19:12.444
The body mods are his identity.

19:12.478 --> 19:14.595
It's who he is,
so you can't just go in there

19:14.613 --> 19:16.031
and order him to do whatever you want.

19:16.065 --> 19:18.366
You have to sit down with him.
You have to talk him through it.

19:18.401 --> 19:19.951
Yeah, maybe then I'll show him the C.T.,

19:19.985 --> 19:21.653
I'll point out exactly
where his brain's turning

19:21.704 --> 19:23.071
into mashed potatoes.

19:23.105 --> 19:24.772
(telephone rings in distance)

19:24.790 --> 19:26.491
Are we done here?

19:26.542 --> 19:28.493
Do you ever think of the other person?

19:28.544 --> 19:31.162
Like, <i>anyone</i> who isn't you?

19:31.213 --> 19:33.214
I'm not gonna dignify that with an answer.

19:33.249 --> 19:34.632
Okay.

19:37.586 --> 19:39.721
Sandhya has had a rare reaction

19:39.755 --> 19:42.891
to a routine medication
called sevoflurane.

19:42.925 --> 19:45.343
It's, uh, 1 in 50,000.

19:45.394 --> 19:49.464
It's an anesthetic that we administer

19:49.482 --> 19:52.183
in vapor form during surgery.

19:53.352 --> 19:56.071
The reaction raised her body temperature,

19:56.105 --> 19:58.907
and it has affected her brain.

19:58.941 --> 20:00.692
(voice breaks) Is she going to die?

20:00.743 --> 20:05.313
There is always a chance that
she could develop complications.

20:05.331 --> 20:07.499
Internal bleeding is a possibility,

20:07.533 --> 20:09.584
heart failure, stroke,

20:09.618 --> 20:15.156
but of more immediate concern
is that Sandhya is in a coma.

20:15.174 --> 20:16.374
A coma? (sighs)

20:16.425 --> 20:18.593
(sighs) We were told
she was just unconscious.

20:18.627 --> 20:20.011
When I spoke with you earlier today,

20:20.045 --> 20:21.212
we weren't sure.

20:21.263 --> 20:23.331
Well, how long will she be asleep?

20:23.349 --> 20:24.766
We don't know.

20:24.800 --> 20:27.168
Dr. Hamza is a renowned neurosurgeon.

20:27.186 --> 20:31.139
He's treating Sandhya, and for now,

20:31.173 --> 20:33.441
all we can do is wait.

20:33.476 --> 20:34.842
(voice breaking) You promised me.

20:34.860 --> 20:38.012
You told me that she would
wake up and walk out of here.

20:38.030 --> 20:39.697
<i>Today.</i>

20:39.732 --> 20:41.349
- Mrs. Ahuja...
- You said that.

20:41.367 --> 20:43.234
Was it a lie?

20:43.285 --> 20:45.120
Come on, mom.

20:45.154 --> 20:47.455
(voice breaks)
Let's go get a coffee, okay?

20:49.542 --> 20:52.527
You told me her surgery was simple,

20:52.545 --> 20:55.413
and now my daughter is dying.

20:55.464 --> 20:57.382
How can you live with yourself?

21:05.174 --> 21:08.309
"I promise you your
daughter will wake up today"

21:08.344 --> 21:09.561
"and walk out of here"?

21:09.595 --> 21:12.063
I said it was a possibility.
I know that it's...

21:12.097 --> 21:13.982
You are a <i>doctor.</i>

21:14.016 --> 21:15.683
Every word that comes out of your mouth,

21:15.717 --> 21:17.652
they hang on to, they believe in,

21:17.686 --> 21:20.605
so you basically lied to them.

21:20.639 --> 21:22.407
(papers rustle)

21:22.441 --> 21:24.742
Sandhya is not Charlie,

21:24.777 --> 21:27.495
and you have no idea what
that family is going through.

21:27.530 --> 21:29.831
None.

21:29.865 --> 21:33.585
(door opens and closes)

21:33.619 --> 21:35.253
(sighs)

21:40.660 --> 21:43.662
(cooing)

21:44.747 --> 21:46.498
Winston Churchill?

21:46.532 --> 21:48.500
Yeah. Looks like him.

21:48.534 --> 21:51.403
Ah, but reincarnation is not that simple.

21:51.421 --> 21:53.989
Okay. Who is he then?

21:54.023 --> 21:56.574
I'm torn between Winston...

21:56.592 --> 21:58.927
and Kurt Cobain.

21:58.961 --> 22:00.379
(whispers) What?

22:00.413 --> 22:01.630
(normal voice) No, no, no, no, no.

22:01.681 --> 22:03.548
Hear me out.

22:03.582 --> 22:06.051
He's got Winston's cheeks,

22:06.085 --> 22:09.971
but I feel his soul is more complicated.

22:10.022 --> 22:12.891
(cooing continues)

22:12.925 --> 22:16.395
You look sad, Charlie.

22:16.429 --> 22:18.196
Are you worried you
won't get to have kids?

22:18.231 --> 22:20.699
No. (sighs)

22:20.733 --> 22:25.404
I'm worried that the people
I love are forgetting who I am

22:25.438 --> 22:27.706
'cause all they see is a comatose body.

22:27.740 --> 22:29.774
Well, it doesn't take a coma

22:29.792 --> 22:32.744
for people to not see who you really are.

22:36.132 --> 22:39.217
Take my fiance, for example.

22:43.456 --> 22:45.674
(gasps)

22:45.725 --> 22:49.344
My fiance. Did... didn't I just say that?

22:49.395 --> 22:50.679
(panting) What's happening to me?

22:50.730 --> 22:52.180
I'm not sure.

22:55.634 --> 22:56.768
What is it?

22:56.802 --> 22:57.936
Her leg's white from the mid-calf down.

22:57.970 --> 23:00.355
(sighs) Arterial thrombosis?

23:00.406 --> 23:01.690
Blood clot in the femoral artery.

23:01.741 --> 23:03.024
I gave her an angiogram.

23:03.075 --> 23:04.693
So we're doing an emergency thrombectomy?

23:04.744 --> 23:05.694
Yep. Right now.

23:05.745 --> 23:06.912
- What's that?
- Mom.

23:06.946 --> 23:08.947
She has a blood clot.
We need to remove it.

23:08.981 --> 23:10.832
- I need to be with her.
- Mom.

23:10.867 --> 23:12.534
- I'm sorry. You can't.
- No, I... there's no way I'm leaving her...

23:12.585 --> 23:13.668
- Mom, come on.
- With you again.

23:13.703 --> 23:14.703
You can have a seat in the waiting room.

23:14.754 --> 23:15.704
Dr. Reid and I need to move fast.

23:15.755 --> 23:16.838
- No.
- (panting) Mom.

23:16.873 --> 23:17.839
I'll come and talk to
you as soon as I can.

23:17.874 --> 23:19.124
I... (sighs) please, Mrs. Ahuja.

23:19.158 --> 23:20.959
Okay, mom. Come on. Sit down.

23:25.431 --> 23:26.598
Is this dangerous?

23:26.632 --> 23:28.216
Yes.

23:28.267 --> 23:30.502
But don't worry.

23:30.520 --> 23:33.722
Dr. Reid's done this procedure
hundreds of times before.

23:33.773 --> 23:35.857
She knows what she's doing.

23:35.892 --> 23:39.861
(sighs) Yeah. Heard that before.

23:43.449 --> 23:47.569
Losing a patient or harming a patient

23:47.620 --> 23:49.621
is every surgeon's worst nightmare,

23:49.655 --> 23:52.324
but it happens, and you should know

23:52.358 --> 23:57.295
that your doctor feels guilty and awful.

23:59.465 --> 24:01.366
Do you know her?

24:01.384 --> 24:03.301
I do. She's my fiancee.

24:04.871 --> 24:06.421
(Melanda) You're close.

24:06.472 --> 24:09.090
(sighs) Where the hell is it?

24:09.141 --> 24:11.343
I thought it was right there.

24:11.377 --> 24:13.044
Maybe we're not down far enough.

24:13.062 --> 24:15.680
Might be up against the wall.

24:15.714 --> 24:17.182
I'll look.

24:17.216 --> 24:18.850
Yeah.

24:18.884 --> 24:21.319
There it is. (sighs)

24:21.354 --> 24:24.322
It's up against the left wall.
I just need to move past it.

24:24.357 --> 24:26.908
(beeps)

24:26.943 --> 24:28.726
Okay.

24:28.744 --> 24:30.111
Get ready to inflate the balloon.

24:30.162 --> 24:32.163
(beeps)

24:34.233 --> 24:37.402
(beeps)

24:37.420 --> 24:40.755
Okay. (sighs) inflating.

24:41.857 --> 24:43.959
(sighs) Okay. Balloon inflated.

24:44.010 --> 24:45.410
You got it. She's golden.

24:45.428 --> 24:46.962
Let's get this thing out of her.

24:49.098 --> 24:50.215
(beeps)

24:52.351 --> 24:53.585
Oh.

24:55.271 --> 24:56.638
(sighs)

24:56.689 --> 24:57.755
You rock.

24:57.773 --> 24:59.691
Ohh. (sighs)

24:59.725 --> 25:02.060
Vascular clamp.

25:02.094 --> 25:03.061
(beeps)

25:03.095 --> 25:04.062
Then I'll suture.

25:04.096 --> 25:06.314
Uh, I can do it, if you like.

25:06.365 --> 25:10.201
(panting) Thanks.

25:10.236 --> 25:11.703
I have to go talk to the family,

25:11.737 --> 25:15.073
convince them this is good news,
despite <i>all</i> the bad news.

25:15.107 --> 25:17.742
What are my chances, do you think?

25:17.776 --> 25:21.079
Uh, that all depends on
how long you stay under.

25:21.113 --> 25:22.797
Have long have you been in your...

25:22.832 --> 25:24.115
Uh, over a month.

25:24.133 --> 25:27.619
Yeah. I know. My...
my prospects aren't terrific.

25:27.637 --> 25:30.255
God. I should be consoling you.

25:30.289 --> 25:31.756
You know what?

25:31.790 --> 25:34.509
All things considered,

25:34.560 --> 25:36.895
today's been a pretty good day.

25:36.929 --> 25:40.798
(indistinct conversations)

25:40.816 --> 25:42.350
Who's that?

25:42.385 --> 25:43.768
Sanjay, my fiance.

25:43.802 --> 25:45.904
Oh.

25:45.938 --> 25:47.606
Do you want to be...

25:47.640 --> 25:49.107
I want to get away from him,

25:49.141 --> 25:51.026
as far away from him as I can.

25:59.251 --> 26:01.586
(telephone rings)

26:04.340 --> 26:07.158
Miller, my patient... you seen him?

26:07.176 --> 26:08.660
- Karn?
- Yeah.

26:08.678 --> 26:10.462
Checked himself out,
signed a refusal of treatment,

26:10.496 --> 26:12.497
- and took off.
- You didn't try and stop him?

26:12.515 --> 26:13.498
Of course I tried to stop him.

26:13.516 --> 26:14.716
I did everything I could to stop him,

26:14.767 --> 26:16.101
but if the guy wants to go,
he's allowed to go.

26:16.135 --> 26:17.602
I don't make up the rules.

26:22.191 --> 26:23.725
(moans)

26:28.864 --> 26:30.148
(groans)

26:30.182 --> 26:32.400
(wheezes)

26:32.451 --> 26:34.486
(groans)

26:36.522 --> 26:38.957
- Karn.
- Hey. Watch where you're walking, freak.

26:38.991 --> 26:39.991
Ah. Sorry.

26:40.025 --> 26:41.793
What did you say?

26:41.827 --> 26:43.411
Get a load of this guy.

26:43.462 --> 26:45.213
- You want to do this?
- No. No. No. No. No. No.

26:45.247 --> 26:47.666
- It's cool. Karn. Karn. Karn.
- What's he got? Rabies?

26:47.700 --> 26:50.034
Hey. You're delirious.
You need to let me help you.

26:50.052 --> 26:51.169
You stay away from me.

26:51.203 --> 26:52.253
Maybe you should take him to the vet.

26:52.304 --> 26:53.705
You should just back off.

26:53.723 --> 26:55.223
- Take it back! Take it back!
- Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey.

26:55.257 --> 26:57.709
Let's go. Come on.
Guys, both of you... enough.

26:57.727 --> 26:59.928
Enough.

26:59.979 --> 27:00.979
(grunts)

27:01.013 --> 27:02.514
Karn! Hey.

27:02.548 --> 27:04.933
(speaks indistinctly)
You okay? You all right?

27:04.984 --> 27:06.050
Can-can you sit?

27:06.068 --> 27:08.737
(groans)

27:10.624 --> 27:13.325
(monitor beeps rhythmically)

27:13.376 --> 27:15.878
Didn't want to let go of his horns, huh?

27:15.912 --> 27:18.580
Not even if it killed him.

27:18.614 --> 27:21.050
People are strange.

27:21.084 --> 27:22.635
Yeah.

27:23.753 --> 27:25.287
He's out there, all right,

27:25.305 --> 27:28.623
but at least he's living his own story.

27:28.642 --> 27:30.342
(chuckles)
Look who's turning into a softie.

27:30.393 --> 27:31.894
(chuckles)

27:31.928 --> 27:34.313
(monitor beeps)

27:34.347 --> 27:37.683
Okay, I'm going to cut out the horns

27:37.734 --> 27:39.735
And scrape the infection from the skull.

27:39.769 --> 27:41.603
You're the man.

27:41.637 --> 27:44.606
You know, I had a boyfriend
once who had a pierced tongue.

27:44.640 --> 27:46.191
Kissing him was like

27:46.242 --> 27:48.027
making out with a shish kebab.

27:48.078 --> 27:50.829
You like to share, don't you, Victor?

27:50.864 --> 27:52.197
Yeah.

28:05.845 --> 28:09.465
My fiance comes to see me,

28:09.499 --> 28:11.216
and I run.

28:12.502 --> 28:14.136
That's a terrible thing to do.

28:14.170 --> 28:15.187
Well, I don't think he noticed,

28:15.221 --> 28:17.439
if that makes you feel any better.

28:18.942 --> 28:22.344
I'm supposed to marry him
this weekend, Charlie,

28:22.362 --> 28:23.779
so why...

28:23.813 --> 28:25.364
Because you don't love him.

28:27.033 --> 28:29.518
So why do you wanna marry him?

28:29.536 --> 28:31.653
I have to.

28:31.687 --> 28:33.455
It's been arranged. It's a big deal.

28:33.490 --> 28:34.689
I promised my father that...

28:34.708 --> 28:35.857
You'd spend the rest of your life

28:35.875 --> 28:36.992
with someone you don't love?

28:40.296 --> 28:42.047
Okay.

28:42.082 --> 28:43.549
What's-what's wrong with this guy?

28:47.837 --> 28:49.221
I love to sing,

28:49.255 --> 28:52.474
but I have the worst voice in the world.

28:52.509 --> 28:55.427
Who cares? Right?

28:55.478 --> 28:59.398
I wanted karaoke at our reception.

28:59.432 --> 29:01.066
He said no.

29:01.101 --> 29:03.102
And it's not just that.

29:03.153 --> 29:05.220
He doesn't want to travel.

29:05.238 --> 29:08.023
He wants kids, which is great,

29:08.057 --> 29:10.826
except I don't even really
think that he likes them.

29:13.163 --> 29:17.533
You know, I was married
to the wrong... woman...

29:17.567 --> 29:19.001
once.

29:20.903 --> 29:24.757
And then one day, I found myself engaged

29:24.791 --> 29:26.375
to the right woman.

29:26.409 --> 29:29.411
How did you know that
she was the right one?

29:29.429 --> 29:32.014
Oh, because she-she got <i>me,</i>

29:32.048 --> 29:35.434
you know, warts and all.

29:36.503 --> 29:38.303
And every new thing I learned about her

29:38.354 --> 29:39.772
just made me love her more.

29:43.359 --> 29:45.260
Listen, when you say
you're a lousy singer,

29:45.278 --> 29:46.562
like, how bad are we talking?

29:46.596 --> 29:48.197
Are we talking, like... like,
professional lousy

29:48.231 --> 29:49.731
or are we talking, like,
real person lousy, 'cause...

29:49.765 --> 29:52.201
Oh, we're talking pretty lousy.

29:52.235 --> 29:53.819
Sing. I want to hear it. Come on.

30:28.655 --> 30:30.138
Sandhya?

30:30.156 --> 30:33.575
I had that strange feeling again.

30:33.610 --> 30:37.446
Sandhya?

30:37.480 --> 30:39.865
(gasps)

30:39.916 --> 30:41.366
Come with me.

30:41.417 --> 30:46.121
Come with me.
I think I know what's wrong with you.

30:49.342 --> 30:50.709
Hey.

30:50.760 --> 30:52.160
I'm Dr. Goran.

30:52.178 --> 30:54.379
Hey. I'm Karn's wife Kat.

30:54.430 --> 30:55.714
Nice to meet you.

30:55.765 --> 30:58.600
You, too. How's he doing?

30:58.635 --> 31:00.219
He's doing very well, actually.

31:00.270 --> 31:01.803
Yeah. How you doing, mate?

31:03.273 --> 31:04.640
- Um, his surgery was...
- I'm awake.

31:04.674 --> 31:06.808
Wanna see daddy?

31:06.842 --> 31:08.560
So the surgery was a success.

31:08.611 --> 31:11.313
Uh, we were able to excise
all the infected bone.

31:11.347 --> 31:13.398
I'm going to put you on
some oral antibiotics.

31:13.449 --> 31:14.566
As soon as you're in the clear,
we'll discharge you.

31:14.601 --> 31:16.568
Thank you.

31:16.619 --> 31:19.321
You've got a beautiful family here, Karn.

31:19.355 --> 31:21.840
Hope they get to keep you around.

31:21.875 --> 31:23.242
What does that mean?

31:23.276 --> 31:24.910
It means you can't work
on yourself anymore.

31:24.961 --> 31:27.162
Because only a guy like you
can do something like that?

31:27.196 --> 31:29.248
No, because unless you're in an O.R,
it's not sterile.

31:29.299 --> 31:31.750
You're going to get an infection,
guaranteed.

31:31.801 --> 31:34.186
I'll think about it.

31:34.220 --> 31:37.306
Good.

31:37.340 --> 31:39.708
And you <i>can</i> think about it...
(sighs)

31:39.726 --> 31:42.094
because we saved your brain today.

31:42.145 --> 31:43.428
(horns rattle)

31:43.463 --> 31:46.348
(monitor beating steadily)

31:47.734 --> 31:49.234
Okay. What else?

31:49.269 --> 31:51.103
What if Sandhya's
reaction to the anesthetic

31:51.154 --> 31:52.571
affected her intracranial pressure

31:52.605 --> 31:54.055
and her brain is infarcted?

31:54.073 --> 31:56.658
I tested that. The profusion
scan came out normal.

31:56.693 --> 31:59.044
She doesn't see the thing
that's right in front of her.

31:59.078 --> 32:01.697
There's no way that you can tell her?

32:01.731 --> 32:03.865
Maybe we can find a psychic.

32:03.900 --> 32:06.285
Uh, yeah. That's not gonna work.

32:06.336 --> 32:07.536
What if she was encephalopathic?

32:07.570 --> 32:09.254
Mm, she'd still have a fever.

32:09.289 --> 32:10.589
- Does she?
- No.

32:14.460 --> 32:17.846
Alex, take a step back.
This isn't just a coma.

32:17.880 --> 32:20.465
You're too focused on the test.
You're not seeing the symptoms.

32:20.516 --> 32:22.351
(cell phone buzzes)

32:24.420 --> 32:27.806
(sighs) You've gotta be kidding me.

32:32.729 --> 32:34.780
I told you to get rid of him.

32:34.814 --> 32:36.698
Oh, no. What now?

32:36.733 --> 32:38.600
I caught him massaging sadhya.

32:38.618 --> 32:41.603
Her family went for a walk,
and he sneaked in here.

32:41.621 --> 32:43.372
- What?
- It was reiki. I-I didn't touch her.

32:43.406 --> 32:45.106
I just moved her energy around.

32:45.124 --> 32:46.208
Of course you did.

32:46.242 --> 32:48.243
(sighs) Oh, ye of little faith.

32:48.277 --> 32:50.445
No room for faith in science, Ash.

32:50.463 --> 32:53.465
No place for invading
my patient's privacy in the I.C.U.

32:53.499 --> 32:55.000
I love you, Alex,

32:55.051 --> 32:56.351
but get him out of here,
or I'm calling security.

32:56.386 --> 32:57.719
I will. Sorry, Mel.

32:57.754 --> 33:00.839
Western medicine is so
focused on the disease.

33:00.890 --> 33:03.625
You don't see the whole, the universal.

33:03.643 --> 33:06.845
But because I respect the chi,
the universal energy

33:06.896 --> 33:09.231
that surrounds each and every one of us,

33:09.265 --> 33:11.900
I know that Charlie and my Mona Lisa here

33:11.934 --> 33:14.302
are on their journey
back towards equilibrium.

33:14.320 --> 33:15.737
Okay, Ash...

33:15.772 --> 33:18.306
See? She's trying to communicate with us.

33:18.324 --> 33:20.642
She's saying, "I'm still here,"

33:20.660 --> 33:22.694
"the eternal me."

33:22.745 --> 33:24.479
How many times has she done this?

33:24.497 --> 33:26.314
Smiled?

33:26.332 --> 33:28.917
I noticed it during our reiki sessions.

33:28.951 --> 33:32.320
Uh, I didn't touch her.
I just moved her energy around.

33:32.338 --> 33:35.590
When I placed my hand over
her heart chakra, she smiled.

33:35.625 --> 33:37.092
How long ago was that?

33:37.126 --> 33:38.260
About ten minutes or so.

33:38.294 --> 33:39.327
Repetitive myoclonus.

33:39.345 --> 33:41.546
Somebody call Dr. Hamza.

33:41.597 --> 33:43.998
We need him in here now.

33:44.017 --> 33:45.434
Good news, Sandhya.

33:45.468 --> 33:47.469
Looks like you're gonna wake up.

33:55.665 --> 33:59.001
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

33:59.035 --> 34:00.586
We believe Sandhya's suffering

34:00.620 --> 34:02.121
from what's called status epilepticus.

34:02.155 --> 34:04.523
Her body's having multiple seizures,

34:04.557 --> 34:06.842
and it's the seizures,
not the reaction to the anesthetic,

34:06.876 --> 34:09.545
that's keeping her in a comatose state.

34:09.579 --> 34:11.096
Well, why didn't you see this before?

34:11.130 --> 34:13.716
Well, a single E.E.G.
won't catch it, but this will.

34:13.766 --> 34:16.051
This takes continuous
video of her waveforms.

34:16.101 --> 34:17.553
It records brain activity.

34:17.603 --> 34:19.605
Hopefully, we'll find
a pattern indicating seizures.

34:19.639 --> 34:21.005
And if you do?

34:21.024 --> 34:22.725
If we do, then we put
Sandhya on anticonvulsants

34:22.775 --> 34:24.176
And stabilize her.

34:24.194 --> 34:25.194
And she'll wake up?

34:25.228 --> 34:27.228
It's a possibility. Yes.

34:27.280 --> 34:29.281
(sighs)

34:45.415 --> 34:47.166
Mm.

34:47.199 --> 34:50.252
I bet I know what you're
thinking right now.

34:50.303 --> 34:52.888
Finally. A man who can read my mind.

34:52.922 --> 34:55.507
You're thinking that...

34:55.541 --> 34:58.710
being here is easy,

34:58.728 --> 35:01.146
being in between places.

35:01.181 --> 35:02.848
No weddings to plan and no, uh...

35:02.882 --> 35:04.733
No father to please in the next life

35:04.768 --> 35:07.186
- and mother to please in this one?
- Something like that.

35:07.220 --> 35:09.387
Remember how you said

35:09.405 --> 35:11.440
every new thing that you learn
about your fiancee

35:11.491 --> 35:12.608
makes you love her more?

35:12.659 --> 35:14.392
Yeah.

35:14.410 --> 35:16.528
I want that.

35:16.562 --> 35:18.197
I don't want to live without that.

35:18.231 --> 35:20.232
Am I crazy?

35:20.250 --> 35:21.399
No.

35:21.417 --> 35:23.535
No, you're not crazy.

35:23.569 --> 35:25.370
I want that, too.

35:25.404 --> 35:29.541
I'm 27, Charlie,
and I've never been in love.

35:29.576 --> 35:31.410
Honestly, that's like a crime.

35:34.955 --> 35:36.027
It is.

35:36.883 --> 35:39.885
(monitor beeping rhythmically,
respirator whooshing)

35:46.309 --> 35:47.926
(beep)

35:47.960 --> 35:50.062
Anything?

35:50.096 --> 35:52.564
Let's give it a minute.

35:52.599 --> 35:54.766
(beeps)

35:54.800 --> 35:56.935
Oh.

35:56.969 --> 35:58.437
(pants) Is that it?

35:58.471 --> 35:59.804
I don't have much time.

35:59.823 --> 36:02.140
Come on. Sit.

36:02.158 --> 36:05.644
They've probably given
you a shot of phenytoin

36:05.662 --> 36:07.362
'cause they've seen the seizures.

36:07.413 --> 36:09.081
Okay? It'll reduce
the electrical conductance

36:09.115 --> 36:10.499
among the brain cells... (laughs)

36:10.533 --> 36:12.651
and it will stop the seizures.
Why are you laughing?

36:12.669 --> 36:14.786
(laughs) Always the doctor.

36:14.820 --> 36:16.705
Hey, don't knock it.
Science is bringing you back, kid.

36:16.756 --> 36:19.541
Thanks to a hippie scrubbing my chakras.

36:20.844 --> 36:24.546
See? It's all interconnected,
Charlie Harris.

36:24.597 --> 36:26.431
Well, that would be something,
wouldn't it?

36:31.104 --> 36:32.137
Kiss me, Charlie.

36:32.171 --> 36:34.106
Just once before I go back.

36:34.140 --> 36:36.808
Sandhya, I...

36:36.843 --> 36:39.278
I appreciate the invitation, but I...

36:39.312 --> 36:40.779
I can't do that.

36:44.784 --> 36:46.618
Then do a girl a solid
and take off your tux.

36:46.653 --> 36:48.287
What? (laughs)

36:48.321 --> 36:49.521
Seriously?

36:49.539 --> 36:51.540
(laughs)

36:51.574 --> 36:54.243
(panting)

36:54.294 --> 36:55.860
I can feel it, Charlie.

36:55.879 --> 36:58.997
I can feel my body. It's calling me back.

37:02.218 --> 37:03.886
It's like...

37:03.920 --> 37:04.920
What's it like?

37:04.971 --> 37:08.257
I'm connected...

37:08.308 --> 37:09.874
to myself,

37:09.893 --> 37:11.376
my mother,

37:11.394 --> 37:12.511
to you,

37:12.545 --> 37:14.479
Dr. Reid.

37:14.514 --> 37:16.598
I'm connected to everything.

37:16.649 --> 37:20.903
It's warm.

37:20.937 --> 37:22.487
It's wonderful.

37:22.522 --> 37:24.940
It's... (panting)

37:24.991 --> 37:27.109
it's life.

for after the honeymoon.

38:55.615 --> 38:59.317
Guys, I'm so, so sorry

38:59.335 --> 39:02.504
for putting everyone
through such a big scare.

39:02.538 --> 39:03.538
You did.

39:03.589 --> 39:07.009
The scare of my life.

39:07.043 --> 39:10.161
But we have you back now.
That's all I care about.

39:10.179 --> 39:13.098
So what was it like, the, uh, coma?

39:13.132 --> 39:15.834
Was it like you were, uh, uh, dreaming?

39:15.852 --> 39:19.388
I don't remember much.

39:19.422 --> 39:23.291
I just know that I felt safe and...

39:23.326 --> 39:24.793
protected.

39:26.946 --> 39:28.847
Tell her, Sandhya.

39:28.865 --> 39:30.682
She needs to know I'm okay.

39:30.700 --> 39:34.569
Like someone was there the whole time

39:34.620 --> 39:35.821
looking out for me.

39:39.242 --> 39:41.960
We should let Sandhya rest.

39:41.994 --> 39:43.578
Mom, can you stay behind?

39:44.714 --> 39:46.581
Absolutely.

39:46.632 --> 39:48.333
We just need a moment alone.

39:48.367 --> 39:50.201
Sure. (speaks indistinctly)

39:50.219 --> 39:54.372
(telephone rings)

39:54.390 --> 39:55.924
Charlie...

39:55.975 --> 39:57.142
(monitor beeping steadily)

39:57.176 --> 40:00.011
(sighs)

40:00.045 --> 40:02.481
I saved a life today.

40:02.515 --> 40:04.382
A coma patient.

40:06.853 --> 40:09.020
And I realized something.

40:09.054 --> 40:11.890
Just when I think I've done everything...

40:11.908 --> 40:15.861
(sighs)
there's always one more thing I can do.

40:15.895 --> 40:19.531
And it's waiting for me.

40:19.565 --> 40:21.466
I just have to find it.

40:21.501 --> 40:23.368
That's right.

40:24.921 --> 40:27.372
To hell with the naysayers.

40:31.177 --> 40:33.077
You know me best.

40:33.096 --> 40:36.515
So... did you wield a pitchfork?

40:36.549 --> 40:38.350
No, I was a little young for that.

40:38.384 --> 40:39.851
I think I just fed the chickens.

40:39.886 --> 40:41.887
Mm. And it's for sale?

40:41.921 --> 40:44.022
Yeah, my aunt and uncle sold it years ago,

40:44.056 --> 40:45.757
and I guess the new owners
are selling it again.

40:45.775 --> 40:47.425
- Tell me more.
- About what?

40:47.443 --> 40:49.394
When did you go live
with your aunt and uncle?

40:49.428 --> 40:51.813
Uh, a couple years after my parents died.

40:53.933 --> 40:56.535
So for a couple of years,
you didn't have any family?

40:56.569 --> 41:02.040
No, I guess I was, um,
in the system for a while.

41:02.074 --> 41:05.160
I really don't remember much.

41:05.211 --> 41:07.162
Let's buy it.

41:07.213 --> 41:08.914
(coughs) What?

41:08.948 --> 41:10.749
I mean it. It meant something to you

41:10.783 --> 41:13.135
and maybe still does, so let's buy it.

41:17.807 --> 41:19.007
You really want to do this?

41:19.058 --> 41:21.259
I really want to do this.

41:24.463 --> 41:25.847
We're buying a barn.

41:25.898 --> 41:27.015
Yay!

41:27.066 --> 41:28.132
<i>(glasses clink)</i>

41:28.151 --> 41:29.684
<i>(Alex) Buying a barn.</i>

41:31.053 --> 41:33.538
<i>(Charlie) Every patient has a story.</i>

41:33.573 --> 41:37.442
<i>Sometimes we can't see
what they're trying to tell us.</i>

41:39.278 --> 41:41.029
<i>Sometimes we just don't want to.</i>

41:41.080 --> 41:42.914
Hey, doc.

41:42.949 --> 41:45.367
Show him your horns.

41:45.418 --> 41:47.752
Keep it real.

41:47.787 --> 41:48.954
Always.

41:48.988 --> 41:50.655
<i>But the truth is always there,</i>

41:50.673 --> 41:52.991
<i>staring us in the face,</i>

41:53.009 --> 41:54.826
<i>daring us to disagree,</i>

41:54.844 --> 41:57.662
<i>begging us to understand</i>

41:57.680 --> 42:00.665
<i>and to do what needs to be done.</i>

42:00.683 --> 42:02.884
Alex?

42:04.787 --> 42:06.555
Dawn.

42:06.606 --> 42:09.507
You're still here.

42:09.525 --> 42:11.560
It's a little late for visiting.

42:11.611 --> 42:13.612
No, I came to talk to you.

42:13.646 --> 42:16.648
Oh.

42:16.682 --> 42:18.516
Okay. Good.

42:18.534 --> 42:20.068
I need to talk to you, too.

42:20.119 --> 42:21.736
Charlie should be D.N.R.

42:21.787 --> 42:25.457
I'm appealing to the
consent and capacity board.

42:25.491 --> 42:26.958
What?

42:26.993 --> 42:29.694
He's been in this coma long enough,

42:29.712 --> 42:32.030
and you don't see it because
you're with him every day.

42:32.048 --> 42:34.566
No. Uh...

42:34.600 --> 42:36.968
Dawn, we need more time.

42:37.003 --> 42:39.087
To do what?

42:39.138 --> 42:42.474
You're trying everything you can,
but nothing is working.

42:42.508 --> 42:44.208
There will be a hearing...

42:44.227 --> 42:45.760
I know how this works.

42:45.811 --> 42:47.512
To determine who should make
Charlie's end-of-life decisions.

42:47.546 --> 42:50.098
That person is <i>me.</i>

42:53.486 --> 42:56.204
I'm filing my petition tomorrow.

42:56.239 --> 42:57.555
Be ready.
