12:04.784 --> 12:07.488
Ggot any paper clips? I used all mine.

12:07.655 --> 12:09.422
Thanks.

12:18.132 --> 12:20.774
Is that a chandelier made of paper clips?

12:20.798 --> 12:24.077
You were right, Bugs. Work can be fun.

12:24.138 --> 12:26.272
[Male voices vocalizing]

13:13.454 --> 13:15.388
[Laughing]

13:15.456 --> 13:17.791
[Daffy whistling]

13:17.858 --> 13:18.936
[Gasps]

13:24.298 --> 13:29.569
DAFFY: Hello, world. I'm about to
make you a whole lot prettier.

13:29.637 --> 13:31.448
[Whistling]

13:31.614 --> 13:34.307
[Baby cooing]

13:35.494 --> 13:37.762
DAFFY:
Hello, little baby.

13:37.798 --> 13:39.174
[Crying]

13:39.208 --> 13:41.044
Oh!

13:41.624 --> 13:43.850
[Cell phone beeping]

13:43.918 --> 13:47.047
DAFFY: Tina, it's Daffy. Meet me
at the sunset room in an hour.

13:47.083 --> 13:49.981
And look good. I do.

13:50.011 --> 13:52.179
[Whistling]

13:57.473 --> 14:00.863
I'm looking for my boyfriend.
He's a little black duck.

14:00.883 --> 14:01.926
A duck?

14:01.927 --> 14:03.251
[Chuckles]

14:03.537 --> 14:06.372
Well, I wasn't sure what that was.

14:06.440 --> 14:09.576
We put him in the way back.

14:14.115 --> 14:18.288
Kinda fancy for lunch. What's the occasion?

14:20.387 --> 14:23.123
I'm the occasion.

14:24.959 --> 14:27.254
What happened to you?!

14:27.294 --> 14:30.879
I got a beak job. Look, no bump.

14:31.507 --> 14:35.235
You messed up your whole face
just to get rid of a stupid bump?

14:35.302 --> 14:36.597
You look crazy!

14:36.763 --> 14:40.029
If I look so crazy, how come
everyone's staring at me?

14:42.852 --> 14:46.523
Because you look crazy.
Daffy, I liked your old beak.

14:46.689 --> 14:49.249
But my old beak had an imperfection.

14:49.259 --> 14:51.384
And when it comes to my appearance...

14:51.412 --> 14:54.958
...there can be no imperfections.

14:55.382 --> 14:58.042
Well, it looks like a dog ate your face.

14:58.064 --> 15:01.121
I liked your bump. I like
all your imperfections.

15:01.228 --> 15:02.461
Well, not all of them.

15:02.481 --> 15:07.187
Your imperfections are what
make you you, and I like you.

15:07.627 --> 15:12.402
Oh, I get it. You're jealous because
I have this perfect little beak...

15:12.426 --> 15:15.188
...and you have that giant nightmare.

15:15.485 --> 15:16.501
[Punch] [Thud]

15:16.751 --> 15:18.470
[Daffy groans]

15:18.493 --> 15:20.889
Call Dr. Weisberg!

15:23.784 --> 15:26.553
PORKY:
Come to the conference room...

15:26.620 --> 15:29.289
...and bring the paper airplane.

15:31.792 --> 15:39.265
I give you m-Murphy and Associates
International P-paper Airport!

15:40.531 --> 15:44.850
And you are cleared for landing.

15:47.308 --> 15:50.212
Porky, how long did this take you?

15:50.268 --> 15:52.377
Heh heh! Hours.

15:52.392 --> 15:54.439
It's all I've been doing since lunch.

15:54.481 --> 15:56.016
Pretty fun. Ha!

15:56.029 --> 16:00.097
I know I said to make work fun,
but you still gotta do your work.

16:00.192 --> 16:02.153
What about The Papadopoulos Returns?

16:03.094 --> 16:05.458
Tthe Papadopoulos Returns!

16:21.617 --> 16:25.747
Wow, paper baggage handlers.

16:25.913 --> 16:27.040
Mr. Murphy.

16:27.206 --> 16:29.883
- What is this?
- It's a paper airport.

16:30.340 --> 16:32.863
Have you seen Porky? I need
The Papadopoulos Returns.

16:33.503 --> 16:38.558
[Stammering] This just in.
All flights have been grounded...

16:38.626 --> 16:40.560
Due to snow!

16:40.628 --> 16:44.391
Yippee! Ha ha! [Crazied laughter]

16:44.432 --> 16:47.267
Ho ho! Jingle bells! Ha ha!

16:47.334 --> 16:48.968
You're fired.

16:50.927 --> 16:54.857
[High-pitched voice] Oh! Am I fired, too?

16:55.093 --> 16:57.847
DR. WESIBERG:
Lucky for you, I saved your old beak.

16:58.686 --> 17:01.180
Lucky?! It still has the bump!

17:01.248 --> 17:02.955
And is it a little crooked?

17:06.252 --> 17:07.686
Eh, good enough.

17:07.755 --> 17:11.393
- Sorry about that, Porky.
- Don't be sorry.

17:11.394 --> 17:14.755
You've shown me that life's too short
to have a job I don't enjoy.

17:14.757 --> 17:16.259
Huh. That's great.

17:16.589 --> 17:18.999
You've shown me that I can do anything.

17:19.022 --> 17:20.851
I can get any job I want.

17:21.143 --> 17:22.813
Well, I didn't say that.

17:23.096 --> 17:25.377
You've shown me that
as long as I'm having fun,

17:25.414 --> 17:27.223
I can be anything I wannabe.

17:27.249 --> 17:29.853
I can be President of The United States.

17:30.144 --> 17:31.636
Porky.

17:31.697 --> 17:36.282
Porky Pig is going to be
President of The U-United States.

17:36.350 --> 17:39.966
- That's nice.
DAFFY: What are you guys doing here?

17:39.987 --> 17:42.322
We used to work here.

17:42.389 --> 17:44.660
You're a dentist, too?!

17:44.693 --> 17:46.213
[Laughs]

17:46.298 --> 17:47.471
Lame!

17:49.786 --> 17:50.450
[Ding]

17:50.464 --> 17:54.481
[Screaming]

17:55.469 --> 17:59.960
What? All I said was I never noticed
the bump on his b-beak before.

18:42.116 --> 18:43.783
[Slurps]

20:32.826 --> 20:34.460
Beep Beep!

20:38.844 --> 20:41.931
I'm j-just so excited about
this new chapter in my life.

20:41.961 --> 20:45.226
Work should be fun. Life should be fun.

20:45.258 --> 20:47.119
M-more tea, Diane?

20:50.511 --> 20:52.945
Do you take cream or sugar?

20:52.980 --> 20:56.100
Diane? Do you take cream or sugar?

20:56.945 --> 20:59.246
Diane?

20:59.280 --> 21:02.117
Diane? Cream or sugar?

21:02.742 --> 21:06.016
Diane? Diane?
