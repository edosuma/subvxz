<i>In 1972,
a crack commando unit...</i>

00:03.061 --> 00:04.772
<i>was sent to prison
by a military court...</i>

00:04.855 --> 00:06.315
<i>for a crime they didn't commit.</i>

00:06.440 --> 00:07.649
<i>These men promptly escaped...</i>

00:07.733 --> 00:09.318

stockade...</i>

00:09.401 --> 00:10.986

00:12.696 --> 00:14.656

00:17.326 --> 00:18.577

02:03.091 --> 02:04.217
Hey.

02:18.022 --> 02:20.567
- How are you doing, Joe?
- How am I doing, Del?

02:21.025 --> 02:22.610
I don't know. You tell me.

02:23.027 --> 02:25.154
Well, I think
we're in good shape.

02:25.488 --> 02:28.700
The judge has my writ and I
don't think they have a chance.

02:28.825 --> 02:32.412
You think this Judge Mordente cares
about my rights being violated?

02:37.250 --> 02:39.377
You think this guy gives
a toot from next Tuesday...

02:39.460 --> 02:41.087
about whether or not
I understood my rights?

02:41.170 --> 02:44.257
They got Joe Scarlett, Del.
Do you understand that?

02:44.340 --> 02:45.675
They're holding a big potato...

02:45.758 --> 02:47.260
and they're not gonna let me
drop through the bottom...

02:47.385 --> 02:49.846
because of some legal-beagle
action you might think up.

02:51.264 --> 02:54.726
Is Nicky handling
that matter or what?

02:55.268 --> 02:58.980
Joe, concern yourself
about the legal proceedings.

02:59.564 --> 03:01.935
I could get disbarred
for even discussing--

03:01.960 --> 03:03.008
This is Joe.

03:03.192 --> 03:05.320
The guy who got you
through the bar exam.

03:05.778 --> 03:09.532
You're not a bad lawyer when the other
side is not thinking too straight.

03:09.741 --> 03:13.661
The only way I'm out of this is
that judge tossing the case out.

03:13.828 --> 03:18.082
And the only chance of that is by
twisting his tube of toothpaste so bad...

03:18.166 --> 03:19.792
he's got no choice.

03:20.043 --> 03:23.379
- Now, is Nicky on that, or what?
- Yeah.

03:23.463 --> 03:25.131
Then everything is
going to be all right.

03:26.217 --> 03:28.259
Joe, look...

03:29.510 --> 03:33.848
your brother's coming from Italy.
- What? How?

03:34.140 --> 03:36.601
Come on, Joe, it's been
in all the papers.

03:36.684 --> 03:39.145
Call him.
Tell him not to bother.

03:39.270 --> 03:41.898
He's already left.
He's on his way.

03:43.775 --> 03:47.820
All rise for the honorable
Judge Leonard Mordente.

03:52.825 --> 03:56.079
- I want Nicky on this now.
- He's on it.

03:56.204 --> 03:58.915
I want this taken care of before
my brother gets here, capiche?

03:59.832 --> 04:02.669
You turn this guy's key
and I'm back on the street.

05:29.672 --> 05:31.424
Question, counsel for defense:

05:31.549 --> 05:33.676
"Did Mr. Scarlett
display any abusive behavior

05:33.801 --> 05:35.553
"when you conducted
the search of his home?"

05:35.636 --> 05:39.265
Answer, Officer Bowman:
"Well, no, sir, not exactly."

06:02.955 --> 06:04.165
I...

06:06.459 --> 06:09.545
I need to be excused
for a personal matter.

06:09.670 --> 06:11.881
Court will be adjourned
until tomorrow morning.

06:12.673 --> 06:14.008
All rise.

06:29.899 --> 06:31.484
I'm glad my brother's coming.

06:31.567 --> 06:34.237
Give him a chance to show him
how we do things in America.

07:22.994 --> 07:25.288
- Oh, no. Look--
- Howdy, Judge.

07:26.247 --> 07:28.833
Come on. Take it easy.
Take it easy.

07:30.084 --> 07:33.254
- I'm Hannibal Smith, The A-Team.
- Smith? I don't--

07:33.379 --> 07:36.215
I know. You're afraid of heights.
Mr. Lee mentioned that.

07:36.299 --> 07:37.633
You must be the real thing...

07:37.717 --> 07:40.136
to come all the way up here to
get your daughter back. Here.

07:41.554 --> 07:44.140
Buckle that up. It will
make you feel a lot better.

07:44.307 --> 07:46.058
Then you know that
Joe Scarlett took her.

07:46.142 --> 07:48.895
And you're gonna declare him
not guilty...

07:49.145 --> 07:50.980
even if the jury says he is.

07:51.063 --> 07:53.774
- How long has that jury been deliberating?
- Almost two days.

07:53.900 --> 07:56.110
They could come back with
a verdict anytime now.

07:56.194 --> 07:59.238
- And what do you think?
- Almost definitely guilty.

07:59.322 --> 08:02.867
If I'm reading them correctly, and I'm
pretty good at guessing the outcome.

08:02.950 --> 08:04.410
What are you gonna do, Judge?

08:04.493 --> 08:07.288
Are you gonna let a slime
like Scarlett go...

08:07.538 --> 08:09.582
knowing he's committed a murder?

08:10.416 --> 08:12.126
Smith, that is my daughter.

08:12.210 --> 08:16.297
I can always get a mistrial declared
later, once she's been returned safely.

08:16.547 --> 08:18.758
If she's returned safely.

08:29.185 --> 08:30.436
Uh-oh!

08:33.606 --> 08:35.024
Hang on, Judge.

08:36.609 --> 08:37.818
Hi, guys.

08:45.284 --> 08:46.661
Where does he think he's going?

08:46.744 --> 08:48.829
Captain, there's no way
off that building.

08:48.913 --> 08:49.997
Let's go.

08:54.710 --> 08:56.420
You have any idea
where they're holding her?

08:56.545 --> 08:57.505
No, no.

08:57.630 --> 08:59.632
I just make them send me proof
that she's still alive.

08:59.757 --> 09:03.803
Every week they send someone
with some proof, a photograph...

09:03.886 --> 09:05.471
with something current in it.
- Yeah?

09:05.554 --> 09:08.057
- When do you see the guy next time?
- Tonight.

09:08.349 --> 09:11.769
Since we expect a verdict any
minute, they want to keep me ready.

09:24.615 --> 09:27.451
Are you gonna help me?
Can you find my daughter?

09:27.702 --> 09:31.038
Well, we don't have
much to go on, you know.

09:31.289 --> 09:33.541
And you're a very hot item,
Judge Mordente.

09:33.624 --> 09:36.544
I mean, a judge digging through the
files, looking for the A-Team.

09:36.669 --> 09:38.170
The military's been
all over you.

09:38.296 --> 09:40.673
I mean, I don't think you're
a bird dog intentionally.

09:40.798 --> 09:43.301
But they've been behind you
every step of the way.

09:53.227 --> 09:55.896
Come on, we'll catch them
on the roof. Move out.

09:56.272 --> 09:58.316
Move out, Captain.
Move out!

09:58.816 --> 10:01.861
- Now, give me a hand, Judge.
- What are you doing? What is this?

10:02.028 --> 10:03.946
Tools of the trade, Judge.

10:10.286 --> 10:14.332
Just stay at home, Judge, wait for
their contact. I'll be in touch.

10:20.212 --> 10:21.505
Hi, guys.

10:23.299 --> 10:25.509
I don't believe this.

12:01.151 --> 12:04.196
Hey, Augie. You want I
should go in with you?

12:04.279 --> 12:07.532
Why? You afraid of staying
out here alone?

12:13.580 --> 12:16.333
Good evening, sir.

12:24.508 --> 12:27.678
Hey, I ain't never
seen you before.

12:27.803 --> 12:31.056
May I take your coat?

12:31.723 --> 12:32.974
No.

12:36.186 --> 12:39.940
May I take your tie?

12:40.148 --> 12:41.900
Okay, where is Mordente?

12:43.193 --> 12:47.406
He is in the study, sir.

12:47.823 --> 12:51.243
I have not announced you yet.

12:51.368 --> 12:54.996
I don't need no announcement.
The Judge and I are pals.

12:58.417 --> 13:02.087
May I take your shoes, sir?

13:02.254 --> 13:03.255
Hey, Judge.

13:03.338 --> 13:06.299
What's with the Addams Family come
to work here all of a sudden?

13:06.425 --> 13:08.176
You ain't getting funny on me,
are you, Judge?

13:08.301 --> 13:10.178
No, no, I swear to you.

13:10.345 --> 13:13.849
The man was supposed to come to work
tomorrow. He came today, a day early.

13:13.974 --> 13:17.519
My other servant, the old man, had an
illness in his family and had to leave.

13:17.602 --> 13:20.188
Yeah. Well...

13:20.397 --> 13:22.774
there's a little illness in
this guy's family, too, huh?

13:22.858 --> 13:26.069
- My daughter. How is she?
- Here. Look it up.

13:29.197 --> 13:30.365
So...

13:30.741 --> 13:34.494
how's my favorite
jury coming, huh?

13:34.578 --> 13:36.747
It's a little early to tell.

13:36.872 --> 13:40.876
Well, what do we care.
Because whatever they say...

13:41.376 --> 13:45.213
you are gonna
make it right, right?

13:45.297 --> 13:47.466
May I take your socks?

13:47.549 --> 13:49.134
Now, get rid of this creep.

13:49.217 --> 13:51.887
Then may I take your picture?

13:56.224 --> 13:58.810
Hey, okay, now.

13:59.269 --> 14:00.479
Okay.

14:03.648 --> 14:04.983
Now...

14:05.484 --> 14:09.196
may we take your clothes, sir?

14:09.279 --> 14:10.989
You're all dead, you hear?

14:11.156 --> 14:14.451
The Judge's little girl is dead, you hear?
Hey, Judge, you hear me?

14:14.534 --> 14:17.329
So much for the left profile. Now a
little bit of the right profile.

14:17.412 --> 14:19.080
You hear me, Judge?

14:20.415 --> 14:22.918
<i>Your little girl's
gonna pay, Judge.</i>

14:23.251 --> 14:26.004
<i>You hear that, Judge?
Get out here.</i>

14:26.797 --> 14:28.215
I hope you know
what you're doing.

14:28.298 --> 14:30.217
We're dealing with
savage people, Judge.

14:30.425 --> 14:33.762
Now, Scarlett didn't go to all that
trouble to beat a murder rap...

14:34.012 --> 14:38.016
just so he can release your daughter
who can send him up for kidnapping.

14:46.566 --> 14:47.776
Here you go, Colonel.

14:47.901 --> 14:50.320
I thought you could use a blow-up
for some of the detail work.

14:50.570 --> 14:51.655
Nice.

14:51.780 --> 14:54.199
- Could you get me a three-quarter left?
- Sure.

14:54.658 --> 14:57.536
Gee, it looks like it's gonna have
to be let out a little in the waist.

14:57.744 --> 14:58.954
- No kidding?
- Yeah.

14:59.037 --> 15:01.998
- Okay. You do it.
- Right.

15:08.296 --> 15:10.632
Whatever you guys are gonna try,
you're gonna get away with zip.

15:10.757 --> 15:12.050
We got every precaution.

15:12.175 --> 15:14.553
You try and find that girl,
you better decide...

15:14.678 --> 15:17.389
you want her buried
in cherry wood or pine.

15:17.472 --> 15:20.308
Nobody sees that girl
but me and who I say.

15:20.684 --> 15:22.644
That's exactly what we figured.

15:30.485 --> 15:34.656
Oh, that's good, Colonel. He wore it
on the left. Little further back.

15:34.739 --> 15:37.117
I don't believe it.
You're me!

15:37.200 --> 15:39.244
You never looked this good.

15:53.717 --> 15:56.720
You took your sweet time.
Some kind of trouble?

15:56.845 --> 15:59.347
Nobody gives me trouble.
Just drive the car.

16:00.473 --> 16:01.892
Tough guy.

16:30.962 --> 16:33.465
- You thinkin'?
- Yeah, I'm thinkin'.

16:33.590 --> 16:35.342
'Cause you're real quiet.

16:40.138 --> 16:41.848
I'm quiet 'cause I'm thinkin'.

16:41.932 --> 16:44.434
When I'm done thinkin'
then I'll be done bein' quiet!

16:44.559 --> 16:45.936
I was just asking.

16:48.021 --> 16:49.731
'Cause you was quiet.

16:51.358 --> 16:53.068
'Cause I was thinkin'.

17:44.452 --> 17:45.537
Hey!

17:54.421 --> 17:55.672
Hiya, doll.

17:55.797 --> 17:58.425
What are you, crazy?
You don't give the knock?

18:04.139 --> 18:07.016
Maybe he's testing me again.
Yes, Augie?

18:07.475 --> 18:09.477
He likes to test me.

18:09.936 --> 18:12.772
So how's the girl, huh?

18:13.231 --> 18:17.193
She still doesn't eat. Maybe
that's why she's so skinny.

18:17.986 --> 18:19.779
Well, I'm starving, eh?

18:21.531 --> 18:23.783
- How about something for me?
- Come on.

18:23.908 --> 18:24.951
Hey!

18:31.624 --> 18:32.959
He's thinkin'.

18:40.133 --> 18:44.179
Lori, you don't look too skinny to me.
But I think you ought to eat more.

18:44.596 --> 18:46.514
Don't, you try anything
and I'll...

18:46.598 --> 18:47.682
Shh.

18:47.974 --> 18:50.560
- Your father sent me.
- My father?

18:50.769 --> 18:53.313
- I'm Hannibal Smith.
- Your voice?

18:53.480 --> 18:55.857
My friends and I are gonna try
and get you out of here.

18:56.232 --> 18:58.777
- Now, I'll loosen these ropes.
- I don't understand.

18:58.902 --> 19:02.197
So you can slide out
if you need to.

19:02.864 --> 19:05.867
There. Just hang in there.

19:06.993 --> 19:10.622
- Have they hurt you?
- No. You can help me?

19:13.500 --> 19:14.959
It's gonna be all right.

19:16.586 --> 19:19.589
If you don't like it,
cook for yourself!

19:21.674 --> 19:24.177
How many times
I gotta eat it, huh?

19:25.929 --> 19:27.180
I mean...

19:27.305 --> 19:30.141
how many times
can you eat the same thing?

19:30.225 --> 19:33.311
Look who I'm asking.
You love that stuff.

19:33.686 --> 19:35.271
That's why she makes it.

19:43.238 --> 19:46.366
You ain't fooling me, friend.
I know.

19:46.699 --> 19:48.785
- What do you know?
- Don't play with me.

19:49.160 --> 19:50.995
That whole act don't fool me.

19:51.371 --> 19:52.872
I've been doing
a lot of my own thinkin'.

19:52.956 --> 19:55.416
I wasn't born under
the armpit of no rabbit.

19:57.210 --> 20:01.089
That game you and Marta
played don't fool nobody.

20:01.631 --> 20:04.717
I see the way you was lookin'
at one another. I know.

20:04.926 --> 20:07.804
She used to look at me that way
when she was Sally Boy's girl.

20:08.054 --> 20:09.931
I can't believe
you'd do this to me.

20:10.056 --> 20:12.433
- Nicky, you don't know nothing.
- I don't know nothing, huh?

20:12.517 --> 20:15.687
Her always cookin' those
Polish sausages for you.

20:15.812 --> 20:19.274
Me, I hate Polish sausages.
They make me sick.

20:19.399 --> 20:21.276
This whole thing makes me sick!

20:21.484 --> 20:23.653
What is Mr. Scarlett
gonna think?

20:24.529 --> 20:26.072
You pull that trigger...

20:26.573 --> 20:29.409
and blow this
whole thing over a broad.

20:29.492 --> 20:32.370
Nicky, if I was smart enough...

20:32.871 --> 20:34.831
to get a looker like Marta...

20:35.707 --> 20:40.670
I wouldn't be dumb enough to try
and take her from you, huh?

20:40.879 --> 20:45.466
If you're lyin',
you're dying, Augie.

21:37.737 --> 21:41.073
He drives me crazy.
I can't stand him anymore.

21:41.198 --> 21:45.619
- Well, I think Nicky knows.
- Who cares?

21:45.995 --> 21:48.831
Tonight, I give him
the kiss of death.

21:49.039 --> 21:51.250
Yeah, well,
at least he'll die happy.

21:51.500 --> 21:53.627
- Then you and I, we go.
- Yeah.

21:53.753 --> 21:55.337
Until Scarlett finds us.

21:55.421 --> 21:59.008
With $500,000, we can be
pretty hard to find.

21:59.091 --> 22:00.676
Every penny Nicky has earned...

22:00.801 --> 22:03.179
he thinks it is still in that
numbered Swiss account.

22:03.262 --> 22:06.348
That bookkeeper gave me
that number a long time ago.

22:06.849 --> 22:11.020
I moved all the money.
Nicky still doesn't know.

22:11.312 --> 22:14.356
And he never will.
Well, that sounds wonderful...

22:15.441 --> 22:17.568
unless I wake up
with my throat cut.

22:17.651 --> 22:20.863
Only if I catch you
looking at other women, huh?

22:20.946 --> 22:23.032
That redhead in
trailer number 10?

22:23.908 --> 22:25.951
But you are
too smart to do that.

22:26.202 --> 22:28.162
You are different
than all of the others.

22:28.329 --> 22:30.164
I thought it would be
something like that.

22:35.628 --> 22:37.880
"So when Peter Pan
found out that Tiger Lily...

22:37.963 --> 22:40.633
"and the Little Lost Boys had
been captured by Captain Hook...

22:40.716 --> 22:42.718
"he and Wendy..."
Now, that's his main squeeze.

22:42.802 --> 22:45.221
B.A., why don't you drop me off
at this next corner up here?

22:45.304 --> 22:47.223
I'm gonna dig up
what I can on Joe Scarlett.

22:47.348 --> 22:49.141
I'll meet you guys
back at the Judge's.

22:49.391 --> 22:51.727
"He and Wendy went
looking for their friends...

22:51.811 --> 22:53.229
"but what he didn't know..."

22:55.314 --> 22:57.775
B.A., have you been eating
Murdock's books again?

22:57.983 --> 22:59.652
I can't believe that.

22:59.819 --> 23:01.153
How will I find out the ending?

23:01.237 --> 23:03.072
Now, I'll never know
what happened.

23:27.179 --> 23:28.848
I can't believe
I let that happen.

23:29.056 --> 23:30.599
It was just as much my fault.

23:30.808 --> 23:32.351
Who would have thought
he'd try that?

23:32.476 --> 23:33.811
He could have been killed.

23:33.894 --> 23:36.105
Yeah. Well, he probably figured
he's good as dead anyway...

23:36.188 --> 23:38.023
when Joe Scarlett
got a hold of him.

23:38.315 --> 23:40.317
Now, we have no way
to warn the Colonel.

23:40.609 --> 23:42.736
Well, good afternoon.

23:45.573 --> 23:47.575
It certainly seems to be.

23:49.201 --> 23:52.162
And where has
my Augie-Waugie been?

23:52.705 --> 23:53.998
Oh...

23:54.415 --> 23:55.958
busy-wizzy.

23:57.668 --> 24:01.589
The phone broke down in my place and
I thought maybe I could use yours.

24:01.755 --> 24:05.134
Maybe, if you rub my back.

24:05.259 --> 24:08.220
Yeah. Well, it is important.

24:08.762 --> 24:10.639
And I have to make the call.

24:11.390 --> 24:14.852
All right, but hurry back.
I burn easily.

24:15.102 --> 24:16.520
Yeah, bet you do.

24:36.373 --> 24:38.792
Hello. Yes.

24:39.293 --> 24:42.129
Yes, they are.
It's Smith.

24:44.757 --> 24:46.884
Colonel,
thank heavens you called.

24:47.009 --> 24:48.636
What's the matter?
Augie got away.

24:48.761 --> 24:50.262
It's all my fault. I should've
been ready for him...

24:50.346 --> 24:51.931
but he could be there
anytime now.

24:52.014 --> 24:53.390
Okay, listen up.

24:53.599 --> 24:56.602
I'm at the Pleasant
View Motor Park off I-10.

24:56.727 --> 24:58.520
A 40-foot RV at the back.

24:58.646 --> 25:00.648
<i>Beige, brown stripes,
green awning.</i>

25:00.731 --> 25:03.067
Now there's a guard,
right inside the main gate...

25:03.192 --> 25:04.735
and then there's an Airstream...

25:04.860 --> 25:07.279
<i>and a camper pick-up
right near the hot spot.</i>

25:07.404 --> 25:10.366
I count three armed outside,
and two inside.

25:10.491 --> 25:12.201
- We're on our way, Colonel.
- <i>Okay.</i>

25:12.326 --> 25:16.372
These guys are ready.
Don't let them see you comin'.

25:24.922 --> 25:26.423
Colonel, you were right.

25:26.632 --> 25:29.009
The wire tap on Mordente's
telephone paid off.

25:29.093 --> 25:31.053
- Smith just called him.
- We trace it?

25:31.136 --> 25:33.055
Didn't have to,
Smith said where he was.

25:33.180 --> 25:36.016
"Pleasant View
Motor Park off I-10."

25:36.767 --> 25:37.893
Let's do it.

26:02.918 --> 26:04.962
Hiya, baby.
I'll see you later.

26:06.171 --> 26:07.297
Augie?

26:07.423 --> 26:08.757
I said I'd see you later.

26:08.841 --> 26:11.468
But Augie, how did you get
out of my trailer?

26:13.929 --> 26:15.472
You stay right here.

26:15.973 --> 26:17.266
Augie?

27:03.353 --> 27:05.314
Thanks for the use of the phone.

27:44.103 --> 27:47.231
Excuse me.
Gee, I love that hat.

27:47.314 --> 27:51.151
Listen, I need somebody to
talk to about taking that RV.

27:51.276 --> 27:53.320
I'm from Acme Axle Repair.

28:46.401 --> 28:47.402
You better tell me...

28:47.485 --> 28:49.070
how many people
you got working for you.

28:49.195 --> 28:51.197
Or what? You'll kill me?

28:52.032 --> 28:56.036
Seems to me I get that door prize
whether I talk to you or not, pal.

28:56.119 --> 28:59.164
It's just a matter of how much
you end up liking it.

28:59.372 --> 29:02.792
See Marta here? She used to be
a nurse for a plastic surgeon.

29:02.918 --> 29:06.087
She knows all kinds of stuff
about knives and skin.

29:06.796 --> 29:08.006
And real bad hurts.

29:08.089 --> 29:11.760
I'll bet she likes to cut people's
throats while they're asleep.

29:11.885 --> 29:13.428
What you messing with him for?

29:13.595 --> 29:15.430
I told you how many guys
I saw at the Judge's.

29:15.513 --> 29:17.891
- We ought to take him out and whack him.
- You shut up.

29:17.974 --> 29:20.268
- Just tell them to get the chopper here.
- It's on the way.

29:20.393 --> 29:23.063
Judge wasn't supposed to call nobody.
No cops. Nobody.

29:23.188 --> 29:25.774
- These guys ain't cops.
- Look here.

29:25.982 --> 29:28.234
You let your lQ peek
through for a minute.

29:28.318 --> 29:31.488
I don't know, Nicky. He pulled
the tarp over your eyes.

29:31.571 --> 29:33.907
- What're you talking?
- Him and your lady here.

29:33.990 --> 29:36.034
- I ought to plug you right here.
- Whoa!

29:37.035 --> 29:38.119
What are you talkin'?

29:38.203 --> 29:43.124
Nick, you said you thought Marta
was involved with somebody.

29:43.625 --> 29:44.834
What are you listening him for?

29:44.918 --> 29:46.211
What are you so nervous about?

29:46.294 --> 29:48.380
- 'Cause we ought to whack him.
- Maybe I should whack you.

29:48.505 --> 29:50.298
Sure, Augie.
That way...

29:50.382 --> 29:52.425
she doesn't have to split
Nicky's dough with you.

29:54.052 --> 29:56.304
- Be nice.
- Money? What money? What?

29:56.388 --> 29:59.307
All that money you had
in the Swiss bank account.

29:59.599 --> 30:01.851
The money that Marta moved.

30:04.062 --> 30:06.773
Nobody whacks nobody till I
find out what's goin' on here.

30:38.346 --> 30:39.639
Howdy to you.

30:39.723 --> 30:42.100
How're doing there?
Nice looking outfit you got.

30:42.183 --> 30:47.063
Listen, could you point me the
direction of the main office here?

30:47.188 --> 30:48.023
I...

30:48.606 --> 30:51.026
Well, now, that's ever
so nice of you.

30:52.360 --> 30:54.279
Keep right on movin', pal.

30:57.323 --> 30:59.200
Hey, what's goin' on over there?

31:21.931 --> 31:23.600
Get down. Stay there.

31:23.683 --> 31:25.143
What's goin' on here?

31:58.426 --> 32:01.137
Man, here comes Hannibal.
Let's give him cover.

32:16.361 --> 32:17.570
You guys all right?

32:17.695 --> 32:20.240
I'm telling you, finding a spot
in these trailer parks is murder.

32:20.406 --> 32:21.991
- Where's the girl?
- She's still in there.

32:22.117 --> 32:23.827
If we can keep her there,
we got it made.

32:23.993 --> 32:25.537
Give me a weapon.

32:41.719 --> 32:43.346
Oh, no!

32:52.147 --> 32:54.357
Guys, it's Decker!

32:54.440 --> 32:58.236
<i>Smith, this is Colonel Decker.
Come out with your hands up.</i>

32:58.403 --> 32:59.237
Is he kidding?

32:59.320 --> 33:01.948
<i>You're completely surrounded.
You can count on it.</i>

33:02.031 --> 33:03.575
I don't believe this.

33:12.625 --> 33:14.502
Return fire!

33:45.074 --> 33:46.910
Get that chopper, Captain.

33:52.207 --> 33:55.919
None of the A-Team, sir.
Concentrate on that trailer!

34:06.512 --> 34:08.264
Let's get out of here!

34:58.201 --> 34:59.202
Kay, I can't tell you...

34:59.327 --> 35:01.413
how much I've been impressed
by your work at the office.

35:01.913 --> 35:04.666
For a junior law clerk, you really
have a future ahead of you.

35:05.625 --> 35:07.043
Yes. What is it?

35:12.632 --> 35:13.717
Which phone?

35:15.760 --> 35:17.637
Payphone, right over there.

35:17.804 --> 35:19.139
Excuse me for a minute.

35:25.270 --> 35:29.733
Well, he certainly knows
his champagne. May I?

35:31.943 --> 35:33.194
We have 10 minutes.

35:33.320 --> 35:35.739
Why don't you tell me
everything about yourself?

35:36.615 --> 35:40.118
- Joe?
- It's me calling.

35:45.457 --> 35:46.583
Hey!

35:47.000 --> 35:51.755
I tell you, if you've ever seen the sun
go down behind Chappaquiddick Mountain...

35:51.838 --> 35:54.966
I swear. I don't know anything
about Judge Mordente's daughter.

35:55.050 --> 35:56.760
I'm just an attorney.

35:58.011 --> 35:59.304
Please!

36:02.223 --> 36:04.267
You better get used to it, fool.
Because you're gonna be...

36:04.392 --> 36:06.061
spending a lot of time in
hospitals in the near future.

36:06.144 --> 36:07.896
Please, you don't understand.

36:08.271 --> 36:10.565
Scarlett would kill me.

36:10.899 --> 36:13.568
- And his brother--
- Wait. Wait, wait.

36:16.498 --> 36:17.964
Hold on the presses, Marty...

36:17.989 --> 36:20.241
I think we got a hot one
coming over the wire.

36:23.244 --> 36:25.997
It's the most magnificent sight.
See, it sort of just--

36:26.022 --> 36:26.744
Hey!

36:26.769 --> 36:29.024
We're on our way. We gotta pick
up Hannibal at the Judge's.

36:29.084 --> 36:31.044
Italy, my friend. Italy.

36:32.504 --> 36:33.755
Italy.

36:34.964 --> 36:36.591
And we ain't flyin'.

37:13.186 --> 37:14.629
That's where they're
holding her all right.

37:14.654 --> 37:16.673
Yeah? Well, I guess when
you're the local don...

37:16.756 --> 37:18.383
you don't have to worry
about keeping a low profile.

37:18.508 --> 37:21.928
- I mean, who's gonna mess with you?
- This is a front door job.

37:22.011 --> 37:24.514
No, Hannibal.
We did that at the trailer.

37:24.639 --> 37:26.725
We're not gonna try that
twice in a row, are we?

37:26.808 --> 37:28.017
Sure we are.

37:28.685 --> 37:31.187
- We'll need a back door out.
- Yeah.

37:31.271 --> 37:33.189
Well, there's a dirt airstrip
over that hill there.

37:33.273 --> 37:36.693
We can get a DC-3 off of it.
But we'll have to refuel...

37:36.818 --> 37:39.348
and that's going to drain us of
our remaining working capital.

37:39.442 --> 37:41.364
But we'll be on our way home.

37:48.079 --> 37:50.123
<i>You guys put me on a plane.</i>

37:50.248 --> 37:52.959
<i>You dead.
You hear me? Dead.</i>

37:54.919 --> 37:56.838
You put me on a plane.

37:57.964 --> 38:00.467
That's what you done.
We're in Italy, right?

38:00.550 --> 38:02.594
You guys knocked me out
and flew me to Italy.

38:02.677 --> 38:06.431
And if you keep up this unsightly
behavior, we shall be dead in Italy.

38:06.556 --> 38:08.183
Those are the bad guys.

38:08.266 --> 38:10.852
No more, you hear?
No more planes.

38:10.935 --> 38:13.146
I'm gonna help you guys rescue
that poor little girl...

38:13.229 --> 38:14.856
but we ain't
getting on no plane.

38:15.106 --> 38:17.942
B.A., we haven't got a plane.

38:18.109 --> 38:20.403
The one that Face scammed
is out of gas.

38:20.570 --> 38:22.405
We have to find
some other way home.

38:23.072 --> 38:25.617
Now, let's concentrate on
rescuing the girl.

38:25.742 --> 38:27.660
Hannibal has a plan.

38:27.994 --> 38:30.163
We're going through
the front door again, right?

38:30.580 --> 38:32.999
I think he's getting to know me.
Let's go.

38:45.887 --> 38:48.932
If my father does what you
ask, will you let me go?

38:49.098 --> 38:51.810
Kidnapping is such
a tricky business.

38:52.352 --> 38:56.272
First, we see what the good Judge
decides about my wonderful brother...

38:56.356 --> 38:59.359
then we see
what Don Scarlatti decides...

38:59.526 --> 39:02.946
about the Judge's
lovely daughter.

39:12.622 --> 39:14.207
- Guido?
- Si.

39:14.332 --> 39:16.501
I leave Salvatore here with you.

39:16.793 --> 39:20.088
As soon as you hear from me,
take her out and...

39:20.296 --> 39:21.840
- Capiche?
- Capiche.

39:51.786 --> 39:53.997
All right, all right.
Silenzio.

40:16.352 --> 40:17.520
Jeez.

40:19.939 --> 40:21.441
Helpless old man.

40:21.983 --> 40:24.777
Why don't you hire somebody
to give you a hand?

40:27.155 --> 40:29.616
If I had a son like you,
I'd shoot myself.

40:29.741 --> 40:31.534
I just might do that for you...

40:31.618 --> 40:33.828
if you don't hurry up in getting
this cart unloaded and go.

40:33.953 --> 40:35.163
Grazie, grazie.

40:35.246 --> 40:38.499
You have one more bad deed on your
conscience when you go to die.

40:41.544 --> 40:45.882
Hey, you're not
from around here?

40:45.965 --> 40:49.344
No, I come from America.

40:49.469 --> 40:52.639
Chicago, the land of the home
and the braves.

40:52.722 --> 40:55.433
Why do you think
I got no accent, huh?

41:06.319 --> 41:08.071
Stop! Please!

41:28.424 --> 41:29.926
Missed me.

42:16.222 --> 42:18.141
Give me, give me.

42:27.525 --> 42:29.402
I can't believe
you came after me.

42:29.527 --> 42:31.237
Yeah, we're pretty amazing.

42:37.827 --> 42:39.078
Face!

42:51.049 --> 42:52.633
Get the car!

42:53.551 --> 42:54.886
Move!
