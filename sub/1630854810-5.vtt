WEBVTT

00:41.458 --> 00:42.417
Gloria.

00:46.004 --> 00:48.465
-Gloria!

00:48.548 --> 00:50.633
Gloria.

00:52.093 --> 00:53.470
There's no school today.

00:53.553 --> 00:57.057
The negotiations with the teachers
broke down, and they went on strike.

00:57.140 --> 00:58.349
Family meeting in ten.

00:58.933 --> 01:01.519
Oh, can you get your sister up?
She's such a deep sleeper.

01:01.603 --> 01:04.355
The only way to wake her
is by shaking her, and she bites.

01:04.439 --> 01:05.440
I hear you.

01:06.066 --> 01:07.567
I have my own method.

01:09.069 --> 01:11.613
<i>Rusty, we'll have to do it</i>
<i>running faster than a cheetah!</i>

01:12.822 --> 01:16.868
<i>Well, I kinda told him</i>
<i>that I could run faster than a cheetah.</i>

01:16.951 --> 01:19.788
<i>I see. You were frontin'.</i>

01:19.871 --> 01:21.706
<i>What is frontin', Manotaur?</i>

01:21.790 --> 01:26.503
<i>What if I told you I can eat</i>
<i>four chocolate cakes in ten minutes?</i>

01:26.586 --> 01:29.214
<i>I wouldn't believe you.</i>
<i>You're allergic to chocolate cake.</i>

01:29.297 --> 01:31.925
<i>The last time you ate it,</i>
<i>you died for five minutes.</i>

01:32.008 --> 01:32.967
<i>-That's right!</i>

01:33.051 --> 01:36.888
<i>Frontin' is when you say something,</i>
<i>but the opposite is true.</i>

01:36.971 --> 01:38.515
<i>I remember that day.</i>

01:38.598 --> 01:40.433
<i>You really made</i>
<i>a fool of yourself, Manotaur.</i>

01:40.517 --> 01:41.392
<i>Excuse me?</i>

01:41.476 --> 01:43.311
<i>Chill, man. I'm just frontin'.</i>

01:46.523 --> 01:49.901
-Oof. I used to think Rusty was so hot.
-Used to?

01:49.984 --> 01:52.320
Uh, we had our moment
at the Day of the Dead party,

01:52.403 --> 01:53.655
and it didn't happen.

01:53.738 --> 01:56.116
Plus, he peaked at seven.

01:56.199 --> 01:59.452
And I'm not sure I can get over
the visual of him riding the Manotaur.

01:59.536 --> 02:02.080
There's no such thing as a Manotaur.
Shouldn't it be a centaur?

02:02.163 --> 02:04.916
You're failing algebra,
and yet have time to look up this shit?

02:04.999 --> 02:05.834
Mm.

02:11.297 --> 02:14.384
So what's your deal?
You crushing?

02:14.467 --> 02:16.886
No. No, no, no, no.

02:16.970 --> 02:18.596
We're friends. That's all.

02:18.680 --> 02:20.390
And get up. Dad wants to chat.

02:26.437 --> 02:27.981
Please eat. I have some news.

02:28.064 --> 02:29.274
Is it the cancer?

02:29.357 --> 02:31.734
-No, baby, the cancer's still at bay.

02:31.818 --> 02:33.611
-Oh, come in!

02:34.362 --> 02:36.739
I was just about to tell the girls
about our trip.

02:36.823 --> 02:38.783
Yay! Hi, ladies!

02:38.867 --> 02:41.452
So, Lucia just won a landmark case.

02:41.536 --> 02:44.164
And to celebrate,
I'm taking her away for the weekend.

02:44.247 --> 02:46.708
Actually, I'm taking him

02:47.292 --> 02:48.918
if that's okay.

02:49.002 --> 02:50.837
Oh, we don't have to ask for permission.

02:50.920 --> 02:52.088
-Oh.
-But is that okay?

02:52.172 --> 02:53.798
-Totally.
-Of course.

02:53.882 --> 02:56.092
I hope you can get some rest
from all the sneaking around.

02:56.176 --> 02:59.679
Your ability to climb over a fence
in a skirt, suit, and heels, ah…

02:59.762 --> 03:02.724
Javi, I told you. They're smart girls.

03:02.807 --> 03:06.019
-We see you come and go.
-I hope you don't see too much coming!

03:06.102 --> 03:08.479
Holla!

03:08.563 --> 03:10.273
-We're not there yet, Lucia.
-You're right.

03:10.356 --> 03:14.152
-I felt that right after I laughed.
-It's not a biggie. You're adults.

03:14.235 --> 03:16.446
Consenting adult extracurricular activity

03:16.529 --> 03:18.156
should be performed
and enjoyed at leisure.

03:18.239 --> 03:19.866
-It's healthy.
-So healthy.

03:19.949 --> 03:22.410
So, Lucia, what's your method
of birth control?

03:22.493 --> 03:24.078
We're not there yet, Ines.

03:24.162 --> 03:27.290
Good talk! I'm pulling the plug.
As I do with my wiener.

03:28.041 --> 03:29.959
Tonio will be around if you need anything.

03:30.460 --> 03:33.796
Have fun. And remember,
intimacy is the key to good relationships.

03:33.880 --> 03:35.215
-Mm-hmm.
-Okay.

03:39.886 --> 03:42.222
-Good double reverse psychology play.

03:42.305 --> 03:45.850
Dad's looking for opposition,
so the more we pretend to like her,

03:45.934 --> 03:48.269
the better chance we have
of getting her to go away.

03:49.312 --> 03:51.773
Okay, but what if Dad's
not actually pulling out?

03:51.856 --> 03:55.526
She doesn't look maternal.
They'll definitely break up over a baby.

03:56.277 --> 03:58.863
So, no school, no Dad.

03:59.614 --> 04:02.533
-Time for a party.
-No, we're not having a house party.

04:03.034 --> 04:06.621
But what about a fundraiser
for the teachers?

04:06.704 --> 04:09.874
Or a fun-raiser without the D.

04:09.958 --> 04:12.961
Or with it,
depending on how crazy we wanna get.

04:13.044 --> 04:15.129
Yes! Where have you been my whole life?

04:15.213 --> 04:17.674
Protecting you. We can't have a party.

04:17.757 --> 04:21.052
I know. I'm gonna die without ever
having had a party in this house.

04:21.135 --> 04:23.137
Stop! You're not gonna die.

04:24.973 --> 04:26.140
We're having a party.

04:26.641 --> 04:28.268
Yes! No take-backs, bitch!

04:28.351 --> 04:29.811
Memorialize it. Text the crew.

04:40.947 --> 04:41.823
On top of that,

04:41.906 --> 04:44.492
we've been paying for our own supplies.
I'm a chemistry teacher.

04:44.575 --> 04:46.327
-Beakers and Bunsen burners.

04:46.411 --> 04:48.913
They're expensive and break easily.
What we need is a--

04:48.997 --> 04:50.748
A party!

04:51.416 --> 04:55.628
This just in. Teacher fun-raiser
tonight at the Salazar house!

04:57.547 --> 05:00.300
-Are the kids really holding a fundraiser?
-Oh, I don't think for money.

05:00.383 --> 05:01.884
-Just for support.

05:01.968 --> 05:03.845
Actually, it might just be a theme.
I gotta go.

05:03.928 --> 05:05.221
Gloria wants me to help set up.

05:05.305 --> 05:08.141
I gotta dip too.
I need to pick out an outfit for Cam.

05:08.850 --> 05:11.394
Oh my God, Demi.
I'm so sorry I'm talking about Cam.

05:11.894 --> 05:14.814
It's okay. I'm so happy you're happy.

05:15.690 --> 05:17.025
Just don't want him to be happy.

05:17.108 --> 05:20.028
It breaks my heart my two favorites
are beefing. I wish you'd be friends.

05:20.111 --> 05:22.530
Well, thoughts and wishes
are for chumps and bitches.

05:22.613 --> 05:24.240
See you at the fundraiser!

05:25.366 --> 05:28.161
Okay, that sounded a little mad.
See you at the fundraiser!

05:28.244 --> 05:29.120
Bye!

05:29.787 --> 05:31.497
Ladies, can I get your signature?

05:31.581 --> 05:33.416
We support you.

05:33.499 --> 05:36.252
Take your time
and really hold out for what you deserve,

05:36.336 --> 05:38.296
even if it takes the rest of high school.

05:38.379 --> 05:41.007
-My goal is to get drunk but not throw up,

05:41.090 --> 05:43.551
'cause I don't want barf breath
for my make-out sesh.

05:43.634 --> 05:44.886
Who are you gonna make out with?

05:44.969 --> 05:46.054
Hm, I don't know yet,

05:46.137 --> 05:48.306
but someone is definitely coming
back to my room tonight.

05:48.389 --> 05:49.557
Ooh, here's the contenders.

05:50.266 --> 05:51.726
Eddie, for obvious reasons.

05:51.809 --> 05:53.978
-Hm.
-Leo, 'cause he can roll his R's.

05:54.062 --> 05:55.897
And Carter, 'cause of his face.

05:56.939 --> 05:58.024
We need Jell-O.

05:58.107 --> 05:58.983
And alcohol.

05:59.901 --> 06:01.027
How we gonna get that?

06:04.280 --> 06:06.199
Paws off the Claw.

06:06.282 --> 06:07.158
Put it on our tab.

06:07.241 --> 06:10.328
Fine. I'll only up-sell you
the family rate. 20%.

06:10.411 --> 06:14.082
That's too much.
Ines, let everyone know it's a BYOB sitch.

06:14.165 --> 06:16.793
Whoa. Whoa. Whoa.
You're throwing a house party?

06:17.543 --> 06:18.378
Then the Claw's free.

06:18.461 --> 06:21.214
Man, am I happy to hear
that my nieces aren't little losers.

06:21.297 --> 06:25.760
We're definitely still little losers,
but we're ready to be among the winners.

06:25.843 --> 06:27.011
And I wanna get fingered!

06:27.095 --> 06:29.472
Ooh, okay!

06:29.555 --> 06:31.265
Oh, the Claw stays.

06:31.349 --> 06:33.935
We're not gonna hit up that
children's theater aftershow as planned,

06:34.018 --> 06:36.062
so just take the night off.
Come to the party.

06:36.145 --> 06:39.065
Tonight will be better as a solo job,
working some fees at the door.

06:39.148 --> 06:42.110
Tonio, this is our party.
You can't charge kids to come in.

06:42.193 --> 06:45.154
I'm not going to.
You don't make money charging to enter.

06:45.238 --> 06:47.407
You make money charging for the bathroom.

06:47.490 --> 06:50.284
Free booze means full bladders.

06:50.368 --> 06:52.036
-You know what I'm saying?

06:55.289 --> 06:57.542
-Oh! Oh!
-Are you kidding me?

07:00.086 --> 07:01.838
What's up with you and Rusty?

07:01.921 --> 07:05.633
Nothing… yet.
But what do I want to happen?

07:05.716 --> 07:10.179
I want him to bone my zone,
spread my tread, plunder down under.

07:10.263 --> 07:14.350
I want him to plow my flower
without the fertilizer.

07:15.268 --> 07:18.354
-What does Ines think?
-Nothing. I don't want her in my biz.

07:18.438 --> 07:21.566
Don't you think she should?
She clearly has a crush on him too.

07:24.152 --> 07:25.778
I thought so, but she says no.

07:25.862 --> 07:28.072
Well, then all signs point to clear.
Pursue him!

07:28.156 --> 07:29.657
Unless the curse blocks me.

07:29.740 --> 07:32.410
Hold up. The curse? You're not a believer.

07:32.493 --> 07:34.162
I'm a recent convert.

07:34.245 --> 07:37.123
I saw my mom at the cemetery.
We talked. It was real.

07:37.206 --> 07:39.208
I mean, I was a little drunk,
but it seemed real.

07:39.292 --> 07:40.918
You saw her. It's real!

07:41.002 --> 07:42.628
That's amazing, Glo.

07:42.712 --> 07:45.840
We gotta find Mariluna
and give the box back,

07:45.923 --> 07:47.717
because the box led us to Cinnamon,

07:47.800 --> 07:50.094
and those premonitions
might not be bullshit

07:50.178 --> 07:52.013
and probably aren't good news.

07:52.096 --> 07:53.306
And I'll fully admit

07:53.389 --> 07:56.517
I think there's a curse to reverse,
and the box is the link.

07:57.268 --> 07:59.896
Well, not all curses came with the box.

07:59.979 --> 08:02.690
Some may or may not have been
brought on years ago.

08:04.108 --> 08:06.068
This may come as a surprise,

08:06.152 --> 08:08.237
but Cam and I have been
crushing on each other.

08:08.321 --> 08:09.447
-I know.
-You do?

08:09.530 --> 08:10.990
Everyone does.

08:11.073 --> 08:13.910
But why isn't Cam dumping Andre
and making you his queen?

08:13.993 --> 08:16.370
'Cause for some reason,
he thinks I once said

08:16.454 --> 08:18.789
I could never be with a guy
who had been with a guy.

08:20.833 --> 08:22.668
-What?
-You said it.

08:22.752 --> 08:24.378
-No, I didn't.
-I was there.

08:25.338 --> 08:27.298
-Oh shit.
-Mm-hmm.

08:28.132 --> 08:29.383
That is so messed up.

08:32.845 --> 08:34.889
Two for pee. Four for poo-poo.

08:34.972 --> 08:37.183
But if I can smell it on the way out,
that's a buck more.

08:37.266 --> 08:38.559
I wanna touch up my makeup.

08:38.643 --> 08:39.685
-Ten dollars.
-Ten?

08:39.769 --> 08:42.563
For lying, bish!
That face has poo-poo written all over it.

08:45.816 --> 08:47.944
-I can't believe you convinced me to come.
-Relax.

08:48.027 --> 08:50.404
You two can be
in the same space for one night.

08:50.488 --> 08:53.157
Just be present and have fun.

08:56.869 --> 08:57.703
Jell-O shot?

08:57.787 --> 08:58.663
Ooh!

09:01.040 --> 09:02.792
-They're liquid.
-Didn't have time to Jell-O.

09:02.875 --> 09:04.418
Time to think
about the hurt they caused?

09:04.502 --> 09:06.504
-Cam, can we talk real quick?
-I'd rather not.

09:09.882 --> 09:13.261
Thanks for getting him here. Now I need
to figure out how to get him to listen.

09:13.344 --> 09:14.971
I may have an idea.

09:17.557 --> 09:19.642
-What's up?
-Nothing.

09:19.725 --> 09:22.228
Like, literally nothing. This party sucks.

09:23.312 --> 09:24.981
Nah, the crowd's just chill.

09:25.064 --> 09:26.399
That kid is asleep.

09:27.650 --> 09:29.777
I've got an idea
that'll turn this party around.

09:29.860 --> 09:32.196
Cocaine? Tell me you have cocaine.

09:32.280 --> 09:33.155
What?

09:34.323 --> 09:35.408
What do you have?

09:36.409 --> 09:37.243
Moves.

09:37.827 --> 09:40.997
We're gonna have a dance-off,
and you're my partner.

09:46.752 --> 09:48.629
Yeah! All right!

09:48.713 --> 09:50.089
Get it! Get it!

09:58.514 --> 09:59.390
Come on!

10:00.224 --> 10:01.934
Let's show 'em how it's done.

10:18.951 --> 10:20.411
So, what is this?

10:20.494 --> 10:23.247
It's usually called Edward 40-Hands,
but we work with what we got.

10:23.331 --> 10:24.915
These are Edward Claw-Hands.

10:24.999 --> 10:26.792
-What are the Claw hands for?
-A good time!

10:26.876 --> 10:29.045
Now shut your mouth and follow me.

10:31.547 --> 10:33.633
And don't come out
until you're friends again.

10:33.716 --> 10:34.925
This is a terrible idea.

10:35.009 --> 10:37.678
Trust me. It'll work.
I do this to my parents all the time.

11:07.958 --> 11:09.210
Why is no one hearing us?

11:09.293 --> 11:10.836
Why is the tape so tight?

11:10.920 --> 11:12.463
-Andre's a Boy Scout.
-Eagle Scout.

11:12.546 --> 11:13.964
-Same diff.
-No, it's not.

11:14.048 --> 11:17.385
It's more time, more commitment.
Have you ever seen him gut a fish?

11:17.468 --> 11:19.136
It'd be easier to chew through the tape.

11:19.220 --> 11:20.179
-Do it.
-I can't.

11:20.262 --> 11:22.223
My teeth chip easily, and I'm a bleeder.

11:22.306 --> 11:25.685
But you, on the other hand, have no heart,
so you probably don't have any blood.

11:25.768 --> 11:26.852
You didn't say that.

11:26.936 --> 11:30.064
Oh, like that comment you're pretending
you didn't say when we were 12?

11:30.773 --> 11:32.483
-I need a drink.
-Same.

11:33.025 --> 11:35.861
-Just un-tab me.
-No, not until you own what you said.

11:35.945 --> 11:39.323
No, I'm not gonna own what I said
just because you demand it.

11:39.824 --> 11:42.743
I'll un-tab myself.
I'm not afraid to use my teeth.

11:52.628 --> 11:54.213
I guess we won.

11:56.590 --> 11:57.883
You wanna get some air?

11:58.634 --> 11:59.552
We're outside.

12:00.594 --> 12:01.470
Right.

12:03.222 --> 12:04.098
Inside's so loud.

12:04.181 --> 12:07.435
Maybe we could find a way
to get away from the crowd somehow?

12:10.187 --> 12:12.148
How about outside in the front?

12:12.231 --> 12:13.065
Let's go!

12:13.149 --> 12:14.191
I'll meet you there!

12:16.527 --> 12:19.321
First, I gotta reset the pits
and wring out the panties.

12:19.405 --> 12:21.782
I can't dry hump if I'm snail-trailing.

12:36.297 --> 12:38.007
What? I'm funny, right?

12:38.090 --> 12:40.301
It's all fun and games
until you have to pee.

12:40.384 --> 12:42.136
-Oh my God! You guys!

12:42.219 --> 12:46.682
Rusty and I just won a dance-off,
and now he wants to go somewhere and talk!

12:47.808 --> 12:50.644
Is he just being nice? Or could he be
as into me as I'm into him?

12:50.728 --> 12:53.522
I mean, I wasn't always
sunshine and roses,

12:53.606 --> 12:56.400
so maybe this is his way of making
his work environment more palatable?

12:56.484 --> 12:57.693
Those moves!

12:57.777 --> 13:00.070
We have chemistry.
Oh my God. What do I do?

13:00.154 --> 13:01.280
Stop thinking.

13:01.363 --> 13:04.283
Yeah, thinking always ruins the moment,
which is why I never do it. So go!

13:04.366 --> 13:06.827
-Yeah, go! Go! Go get him!
-Go!

13:06.911 --> 13:07.953
Get out there!

13:08.496 --> 13:10.790
-No! Wait, Gloria!
-Wait, no! Stop! Gloria, please!

13:13.125 --> 13:15.169
Which guy should I bring
back to my room to jump on?

13:15.252 --> 13:16.837
Is that Mr. Price?

13:16.921 --> 13:19.298
Yeah. He brought the tequila.

13:22.259 --> 13:23.552
Take a mustache ride.

13:24.053 --> 13:24.929
Ah.

13:26.138 --> 13:28.140
You're good. But I need a drink.

13:38.859 --> 13:39.819
Hey!

13:41.904 --> 13:44.073
So, where's your dad?

13:44.156 --> 13:45.199
Uh…

13:45.282 --> 13:46.700
Shacking up with his sidepiece.

13:46.784 --> 13:47.785
Oh.

13:47.868 --> 13:48.828
Sorry.

13:48.911 --> 13:52.957
Oh, don't be. I need to get over it.
My mom's been dead for ten years.

13:53.040 --> 13:55.000
He's entitled to an STI and a life.

13:55.626 --> 13:56.710
So are you.

13:57.336 --> 13:58.754
I don't want one.

13:58.838 --> 14:01.632
-You don't want more freedom?
-Yes, that I want.

14:01.715 --> 14:03.467
Crabs? Not so much.

14:05.094 --> 14:07.388
Wait. Why do you think
I need more of a life?

14:08.931 --> 14:12.351
I don't mean to overstep,
but I see how you feel responsible

14:12.434 --> 14:15.688
for everything and everyone
in your family, and it's a lot.

14:16.730 --> 14:20.109
Speaking from experience,
you gotta carve out some time for you.

14:20.192 --> 14:21.902
What do you think this is?

14:23.696 --> 14:24.530
Yeah.

14:25.406 --> 14:28.951
So, are you feeling the pressure
to take care of your family too?

14:29.034 --> 14:31.579
It's me or nothing,
at least for my grandma.

14:32.288 --> 14:35.165
My mom's got the doll money
doing whatever she's doing with it.

14:35.249 --> 14:36.834
So you're on your own with your grandma.

14:36.917 --> 14:40.337
I don't want her to worry,
not after all she's done for me.

14:43.883 --> 14:44.800
Sorry.

14:45.426 --> 14:47.094
Not great party talk.

14:47.177 --> 14:50.264
No! I really like hearing about your life.

14:50.347 --> 14:52.391
I've wanted to know more about you
for a while.

14:54.184 --> 14:56.145
-You think about me?
-A little.

14:59.523 --> 15:00.900
What do you think?

15:00.983 --> 15:04.403
The standard "are you getting
enough sleep?" kinda stuff.

15:04.486 --> 15:05.404
I don't.

15:05.946 --> 15:08.324
Not with you always on my mind.

15:09.366 --> 15:10.868
Come on. Shut up. 

15:14.038 --> 15:15.456
-Okay.

15:33.349 --> 15:35.017
-Damn!
-Um…

15:35.100 --> 15:38.228
-Do you wanna go somewhere more private?

15:51.283 --> 15:53.452
I'm sorry you cut your tongue
opening my cans.

15:54.036 --> 15:56.914
Thanks. Sorry I said that thing
when I was 12.

15:59.833 --> 16:03.879
Look, I truly don't remember saying it,

16:04.463 --> 16:05.464
but

16:06.840 --> 16:08.300
I do remember feeling that way.

16:10.135 --> 16:11.345
And I'm embarrassed.

16:11.428 --> 16:15.516
And I'm so embarrassed
that I was ever that judgmental.

16:17.893 --> 16:19.395
You aren't gross, Cam.

16:20.688 --> 16:21.772
I was gross.

16:22.731 --> 16:23.607
You were 12.

16:23.691 --> 16:25.776
I'm so sorry.

16:26.986 --> 16:28.570
I wish I could undo it.

16:29.780 --> 16:30.614
You just did.

16:31.865 --> 16:32.741
People can change.

16:34.326 --> 16:35.494
I just needed you to own it.

16:37.705 --> 16:40.457
Guys! He kissed me,
and he wants to go somewhere private.

16:40.541 --> 16:43.919
Probably in here, but that would be weird
with you guys. What should I do?

16:44.003 --> 16:45.212
Not be with us?

16:45.295 --> 16:48.007
Oh shit! I just left him standing there.

16:48.090 --> 16:50.009
I need to go tell him I'm in, right?
Right? Okay.

16:50.092 --> 16:52.886
-Yeah!
-Whoo!

16:52.970 --> 16:54.596
-Gloria! Wait!
-Oh yeah! No! Uh…

16:57.016 --> 16:58.017
Rusty!

16:59.059 --> 17:00.686
Hey! No puking in here! No puking!

17:00.769 --> 17:02.021
-Swallow it! Swallow it!

17:02.104 --> 17:03.564
Swallow it! What--

17:05.607 --> 17:06.442
Ah shit.

17:09.278 --> 17:10.404
How's your Claw?

17:10.946 --> 17:11.905
Not bad.

17:12.531 --> 17:15.868
But I'm not sure it complements the outfit
that Andre styled for me though.

17:16.452 --> 17:19.538
Boyfriend <i>and </i>stylist.
Wow, you won the lottery.

17:20.205 --> 17:22.416
Yeah, he's perfect.

17:23.459 --> 17:25.544
But I don't want perfect.

17:26.754 --> 17:27.755
I want someone--

17:27.838 --> 17:28.714
Complicated.

17:29.381 --> 17:32.926
Yeah. Who's against fur,
except on old people.

17:33.010 --> 17:34.636
Because old people are always cold.

17:34.720 --> 17:38.724
Someone brave who bum-rushes strangers
for the greater good.

17:38.807 --> 17:41.268
Bum-rushing is fun
and surprisingly effective.

17:41.351 --> 17:46.106
Someone who can read my natal chart,
my horoscope, and the room all at once.

17:46.190 --> 17:48.067
I guess it's not me.

17:48.859 --> 17:50.277
I can never read a room.

17:52.571 --> 17:53.655
But can't you?

17:56.241 --> 17:58.702
-Drink this. Better for your skin.

18:00.079 --> 18:03.415
Fail! Never take a red cup from anyone.
It could be roofied.

18:04.374 --> 18:08.087
Now I feel obligated to tell you.
Never get into a windowless van.

18:08.170 --> 18:11.340
Too late. Windowless van rides are fun,
especially when blindfolded.

18:11.423 --> 18:12.966
Girl, you make it hard to do God's work.

18:13.050 --> 18:16.970
And you make for an easy target,
like a windowless van victim.

18:19.681 --> 18:21.767
So who's your victim tonight?

18:21.850 --> 18:23.102
Who isn't?

18:23.185 --> 18:25.813
I picked a target,
but the timing isn't right.

18:25.896 --> 18:26.814
Who?

18:26.897 --> 18:30.484
You'll know when you see him coming out
of my room with a smile and a wet face.

18:30.567 --> 18:32.861
I'm a face licker too!

18:33.737 --> 18:37.074
Hey! Sorry to eavesdrop.
How do I not get roofied?

18:37.157 --> 18:39.618
You came to the right person.
I got some tips.

18:41.703 --> 18:44.123
Let me write 'em down. So…

18:46.250 --> 18:47.292
Oh God.

19:01.390 --> 19:03.225
Why is Dad writing a will?

19:14.528 --> 19:15.487
Mariluna?

19:24.288 --> 19:26.915
It's the lady! With the big reward!

19:27.499 --> 19:29.918
-Stop! We wanna give you the box!

19:30.002 --> 19:32.880
Dude, it's her!
I'm telling you! She's in here!

19:32.963 --> 19:34.381
No, from the flyer, man!

19:34.464 --> 19:36.133
That's my missing lady!

19:36.884 --> 19:38.427
She was just here!

19:55.736 --> 19:58.697
Looks like Rusty's heading
into Ines's splash zone.

20:02.242 --> 20:05.579
-Which window can't close?
-Oh, the wind must have closed it.

20:05.662 --> 20:07.039
Cool. Done and done.

20:13.128 --> 20:17.216
Actually, I have a kink in my neck.
Would you mind giving it a rub?

20:17.841 --> 20:18.675
Uh…

20:19.843 --> 20:20.677
Sure?

20:23.889 --> 20:24.723
Oh.

20:28.602 --> 20:30.604
It's actually on the front.

20:37.361 --> 20:39.905
-I feel like I'm choking you.
-Then stop.

20:40.697 --> 20:43.283
-Maybe a kiss would help instead.
-I--

20:43.825 --> 20:47.079
Don't be such a gentleman.
It's okay. I consent.

20:47.162 --> 20:49.081
Um, sorry, I don't.

20:50.290 --> 20:54.253
If this is about those other guys tonight,
I was just trying to make you jealous.

20:54.336 --> 20:55.837
Look, I'm really flattered, but--

20:55.921 --> 20:58.340
But what? Is this about your job?

20:58.423 --> 21:00.842
-'Cause I'm sure it's not a--
-I like Gloria.

21:02.094 --> 21:03.512
-Gloria Del Real?
-No.

21:04.554 --> 21:06.515
Gloria, your sister.

21:08.058 --> 21:12.187
-I'm sorry if this makes you feel weird--
-Me feel weird? No.

21:12.271 --> 21:13.855
You should feel weird.

21:13.939 --> 21:15.983
-You're the one who'll get crushed.
-What do you mean?

21:16.066 --> 21:17.693
Rusty,

21:18.652 --> 21:19.695
Gloria's not into you.

21:20.279 --> 21:22.572
She likes the idea
that you used to be famous.

21:22.656 --> 21:26.159
But she talks about how pathetic you are
now that you work for our uncle.

21:26.243 --> 21:28.412
-Wait, she said that?
-All the time.

21:29.121 --> 21:30.831
She says you peaked at seven.

21:46.388 --> 21:47.723
So what are you saying?

21:48.598 --> 21:52.144
-You know what I'm saying.
-Yeah, but I want you to say it.

21:52.227 --> 21:53.478
I'm not gonna say it.

21:54.855 --> 21:56.064
Let me show you.

22:03.530 --> 22:05.115
Cam! How could you?

22:06.116 --> 22:09.494
Oh my Andre. Is Demi the scar?

22:12.247 --> 22:15.834
I was pouring
my heart out to you, and this whole time

22:15.917 --> 22:19.379
you were drinking my blood
and using it for fuel to steal my man?

22:19.463 --> 22:22.549
How dare you screw Cam up?
I am done with the both of you.

22:22.632 --> 22:26.178
-We didn't mean for this to happen.
-You are off the podcast.

22:41.860 --> 22:43.528
Oh shit! What are you doing home?

22:43.612 --> 22:46.156
I think I get
to ask the questions, Gloria.

22:46.239 --> 22:47.115
Mm…

22:50.911 --> 22:53.747
Ines! You have to help clean up.

22:57.918 --> 22:59.961
Dad said we have to have
everything cleaned up

23:00.045 --> 23:02.672
before we go to bed,
and I'm tired, so get up.

23:05.467 --> 23:07.302
-What happened?
-Just…

23:08.303 --> 23:09.137
Go away!

23:09.221 --> 23:11.765
-I'm not gonna go away.
-I don't wanna talk about it.

23:16.770 --> 23:17.771
What are you doing?

23:17.854 --> 23:20.899
You don't have to talk,
but I'm gonna be here if you ever want to.

23:25.737 --> 23:29.116
I know I said I didn't like Rusty,
but I do.

23:30.200 --> 23:32.452
Or I did.

23:33.120 --> 23:34.996
But none of that matters now because…

23:36.623 --> 23:37.916
there's someone else.

23:41.211 --> 23:42.963
Ines, I'm so sorry.

23:44.256 --> 23:45.715
Yeah, I'm sorry too.

23:46.383 --> 23:47.801
I'm sorry that he likes…

23:49.761 --> 23:51.555
that girl from his old school.

23:54.599 --> 23:55.767
His old school?

23:55.851 --> 23:57.811
He said they're talking about
getting back together

23:57.894 --> 24:00.730
and flirted with me
as if his heart wasn't somewhere else.

24:00.814 --> 24:02.315
He has a girlfriend?

24:03.859 --> 24:04.776
Basically.

24:07.154 --> 24:08.321
Screw him.

24:08.864 --> 24:09.823
He's a piece of shit,

24:09.906 --> 24:12.200
and he doesn't deserve
an amazing girl like…

24:13.994 --> 24:14.870
like you.

24:42.439 --> 24:44.733
It's time to reverse your damn curse.

24:45.233 --> 24:46.276
Where you at, bitch?
