WEBVTT

00:04.421 --> 00:06.840
- So, Bella, you had something
to tell us about Zack?

00:06.923 --> 00:08.633
- Yes.
I've decided that--

00:08.717 --> 00:11.594
- [movie theme playing]

00:11.678 --> 00:13.847
- Uh, guys, do you mind
turning that down we're--

00:13.930 --> 00:15.265
- Shh!

00:15.348 --> 00:17.142
- We're watching the trailer
for Galaxy Battle 4:

00:17.225 --> 00:18.435
The Fight for Peace.

00:18.518 --> 00:21.020
- Oh, look at it go.

00:21.104 --> 00:23.148
- [on cellphone]
We'll bring peace to the galaxy,

00:23.231 --> 00:25.650
even if we have
to fight forever.

00:25.734 --> 00:27.861
- Ooh!
- Oh, yeah, baby!

00:27.944 --> 00:29.237
Woohoo!

00:29.320 --> 00:32.115
- Annoying fan boys like you are
the reason we'll wait

00:32.198 --> 00:35.076
instead of seeing that movie
on Friday night.

00:35.160 --> 00:36.536
- Suit yourselves.

00:36.619 --> 00:38.955
But you're gonna miss out
on our homemade Orion Starfly

00:39.038 --> 00:40.957
and Rando Beeboo costumes.

00:41.040 --> 00:42.792
- Oh shoot.

00:42.876 --> 00:43.918
- Be sure to take pictures...

00:44.002 --> 00:48.298
so I can post them
on boyslookstupid.com.

00:48.381 --> 00:49.924
- As I was saying,
ever since I realized that Zack

00:50.008 --> 00:51.634
was the guy for me,
I've been wanting

00:51.718 --> 00:53.636
to ask him out.

00:53.720 --> 00:55.138
So, today is the day.

00:55.221 --> 00:56.806
- Oh, that's amazing.

00:56.890 --> 00:58.433
This is how you're
going to do it.

00:58.516 --> 01:00.852
Picture this...
You're on a beach in Hawaii.

01:00.935 --> 01:02.979
- Already sounds reasonable.

01:03.062 --> 01:05.230
- He's on the shoreline
waxing a surfboard.

01:05.315 --> 01:08.151
You ride in on a dolphin--
- Okay, here's what you do.

01:08.234 --> 01:10.695
You call him up and say
you, me...we're dating.

01:10.779 --> 01:13.656
And then you hang up.

01:13.740 --> 01:15.366
- What if he wants to say no?

01:15.450 --> 01:18.495
- He can't.
That's the beauty of it.

01:18.578 --> 01:20.830
- These are great suggestions,
but I'm going to go

01:20.914 --> 01:22.123
with my idea.

01:22.207 --> 01:23.374
Zack likes Buffalo Wing
Wednesdays at the Starcade,

01:23.458 --> 01:25.919
so I'm gonna show up tonight
and ask if he wants to come over

01:26.002 --> 01:27.337
to my house and watch a game.

01:27.420 --> 01:29.506
- Oh yeah.

01:29.589 --> 01:30.673
That's better than mine.

01:30.757 --> 01:32.342
- I'm so happy for you.

01:32.425 --> 01:34.594
Ooh, and now I can save the
dolphin for my wedding

{\an8}- So, Bella, you look nice.

02:21.015 --> 02:21.683
{\an8}Why are you all dressed up?

02:21.766 --> 02:25.186
{\an8}- Well, just between us,

02:25.270 --> 02:27.355
{\an8}when Zack gets here
I'm gonna ask him out.

02:27.438 --> 02:29.232
{\an8}- You're asking Zack out?
- I sure am.

02:29.315 --> 02:31.734
{\an8}First I'm gonna butter him up
with a dozen wings.

02:31.818 --> 02:35.405
{\an8}Then I'll follow it
with a half dozen of these...

02:35.488 --> 02:36.698
{\an8}Bam!

02:36.781 --> 02:39.242
{\an8}And then I'll ask him out.

02:39.325 --> 02:41.369
{\an8}- Wow, that's a really
great plan, Bella.

02:41.452 --> 02:42.912
{\an8}Except you forgot one thing.

02:42.996 --> 02:44.789
{\an8}He's never gonna say yes.

02:44.873 --> 02:46.374
- What?
Why not?

02:46.457 --> 02:48.084
- Well, uh, you did break
the guy's foot at homecoming.

02:48.167 --> 02:50.503
- Actually she broke
his heart at homecoming.

02:50.587 --> 02:52.005
- Oh.
- She broke his foot before.

02:52.088 --> 02:53.548
Remember that?
- Come on!

02:53.631 --> 02:54.716
Breaking his heart was
unintentional.

02:54.799 --> 02:57.552
And I did not break his foot,
hHe fell of his bike.

02:57.635 --> 02:59.220
- On his way
to get your corsage.

02:59.304 --> 03:01.389
And then he showed up
at the dance to be your date.

03:01.472 --> 03:03.766
But, surprise...
You already had one.

03:03.850 --> 03:06.853
Uh, uh, uh.

03:06.936 --> 03:09.022
- You guys don't know anything
about romance or relationships.

03:09.105 --> 03:11.524
- Then why don't we ask
someone who does.

03:11.608 --> 03:13.610
Hey, Newt.

03:13.693 --> 03:15.778
Come here.

03:15.862 --> 03:19.449
What do you think about
Bella asking out Zack?

03:19.532 --> 03:22.076
- Oh, Bella,
that is so sweet--

03:22.160 --> 03:23.286
- Thank you.

03:23.369 --> 03:25.246
- --that you'd think he'd go out
with you after all

03:25.330 --> 03:27.123
that you've done to him.

03:27.206 --> 03:30.126
- Oh, don't look now.
But here he comes.

03:30.209 --> 03:32.503
- [gasps]

03:33.963 --> 03:37.050
- So, Bella, you still
going to go through with it?

03:37.133 --> 03:38.801
Bella?

03:38.885 --> 03:41.304
- You guys never saw me.

03:47.602 --> 03:51.439
- Now, my favorite part in all
the Galaxy Battle movies was

03:51.522 --> 03:53.775
when Orion Starfly sliced
that death bot in half

03:53.858 --> 03:54.943
with his laser axe.

03:55.026 --> 03:58.696
And then he looked right
at him and said "See you laser."

03:58.780 --> 03:59.822
- Oh.

03:59.906 --> 04:01.908
- Straight false move, man.

04:03.242 --> 04:05.995
- Yeah, well that Starfly
totally cool

04:06.079 --> 04:07.372
and always in control.

04:07.455 --> 04:10.625
You know, I've always seen
you as my Orion Starfly.

04:10.708 --> 04:12.919
- For real?

04:13.002 --> 04:14.921
Well, I've always thought
of you as Orion's best friend.

04:15.004 --> 04:16.172
Rando Beeboo.

04:16.255 --> 04:20.176
- I remind you
of a half man, half frog?

04:20.259 --> 04:22.011
Oh, thanks, man.

04:22.095 --> 04:24.055
He is my favorite.

04:24.138 --> 04:26.015
- Okay, seriously?
I am totally lost.

04:26.099 --> 04:28.101
What are you guys
talking about?

04:28.184 --> 04:30.144
- The Galaxy Battle
movies, dude.

04:30.228 --> 04:31.145
- Oh, I've never seen
those movies.

04:31.229 --> 04:34.691
- [gasping] what?
- [gasping] what?

04:34.774 --> 04:36.025
- Yeah. I'm just not
a space kind of guy.

04:36.109 --> 04:38.361
I mean rocket ships
and moon men?

04:38.444 --> 04:40.029
It's just not relatable.

04:40.113 --> 04:42.991
- Newt, those movies aren't just
about spaceships and aliens.

04:43.074 --> 04:44.742
They're about so much more.

04:44.826 --> 04:47.370
Okay, how about tomorrow,
before we go see part four,

04:47.453 --> 04:49.706
we all watch the original
three galaxy battle movies

04:49.789 --> 04:51.541
at my house, huh?

04:51.624 --> 04:53.209
- Sure.
I'll give it a shot.

04:53.293 --> 04:54.252
- Sweet.
- Let's do it.

04:54.335 --> 04:55.712
- Oh, this is so exciting.

04:55.795 --> 04:57.714
And then next weekend we can
watch my favorite movie series.

04:57.797 --> 04:59.549
It's about a woman who solves
life's greatest mystery...

04:59.632 --> 05:02.885
love.

05:02.969 --> 05:04.554
- Say what?

05:04.637 --> 05:06.014
- Yeah.

05:06.097 --> 05:07.223
It's called
"The Wedding Detective".

05:07.306 --> 05:10.184
The only crime is being single.

05:10.268 --> 05:11.310
- Pass.
- Pass.

05:18.776 --> 05:21.070
- Tell us again
why you didn't ask out Zack.

05:21.154 --> 05:22.655
- Because the guys
told me he'd say no.

05:22.739 --> 05:23.906
- Right.

05:23.990 --> 05:25.116
I thought that's what you said.

05:25.199 --> 05:28.578
I just didn't believe it...
'coz it's cray-cray.

05:28.661 --> 05:31.247
- Bella, you have been waiting
for this opportunity forever.

05:31.330 --> 05:32.957
- But the guys made
some really good points.

05:33.041 --> 05:34.167
- And you're never going to know
what Zack's answer is

05:34.250 --> 05:36.252
unless you actually ask him out.

05:36.335 --> 05:38.880
- Which is why we invited Zack
back here today

05:38.963 --> 05:40.548
for Buffalo Thigh Thursdays.

05:40.631 --> 05:44.260
- In this email
from Starcade Manager,

05:44.343 --> 05:46.596
Piper Delarosa-Stein.

05:46.679 --> 05:49.140
- Okay, first of all,
buffalo thighs?

05:49.223 --> 05:50.933
Really?

05:51.017 --> 05:52.560
Secondly, Piper Delarosa-Stein?

05:52.643 --> 05:53.936
You just combined your names.

05:54.020 --> 05:55.480
Nobody is gonna fall for that...

05:55.563 --> 05:58.232
Oh my gosh, he fell for it.
There's Zack.

05:58.316 --> 05:59.567
- Bella!

05:59.650 --> 06:02.737
Are...are you guys here
for Buffalo Thigh Thursdays too?

06:02.820 --> 06:03.738
- No.

06:03.821 --> 06:07.700
But that sure sounds
like a delicious idea.

06:07.784 --> 06:10.286
- Since you're here, Bella did
have something she wanted

06:10.369 --> 06:11.871
to ask you.
- I did?

06:11.954 --> 06:14.082
- Yes, you did.

06:14.165 --> 06:16.375
- Sure, Bella.
What's up?

06:16.459 --> 06:19.629
- Hey, so...uh, uh...I...

06:19.712 --> 06:20.797
I know you like watching
football.

06:20.880 --> 06:24.342
So I was wondering if you wanted
to come over to my place

06:24.425 --> 06:27.470
and watch the Texas/Oklahoma
game tomorrow?

06:27.553 --> 06:29.722
- I...I'd love to.
That sounds like fun.

06:29.806 --> 06:31.015
- Great.

06:31.099 --> 06:32.141
See you then.
- Awesome.

06:32.225 --> 06:34.477
Now if you guys will excuse me
I'm going to get me

06:34.560 --> 06:37.271
some buffalo thighs.

06:37.355 --> 06:38.815
- I can't believe it!

06:38.898 --> 06:40.358
I have a date
with Zack Barnes tomorrow.

06:40.441 --> 06:43.194
- ZACK: What do you mean
there's no buffalo thighs?

06:43.277 --> 06:44.821
Get me Piper Delarosa-Stein!

06:44.904 --> 06:45.571
- We should go.

06:48.908 --> 06:53.162
- I now introduce to you,
the famous space smugglers.

06:53.246 --> 06:55.414
Orion Starfly!

07:00.086 --> 07:01.420
- And Rando Beeboo.

07:05.174 --> 07:06.175
- Wow.

07:06.259 --> 07:08.010
You guys really went all out.

07:08.094 --> 07:11.305
I particular enjoy these,
uh, what do you call them?

07:11.389 --> 07:12.473
Space chips?

07:12.557 --> 07:13.766
Starfly snacks?

07:13.850 --> 07:15.601
Oh, Beeboo bites?

07:15.685 --> 07:18.396
- Those are just nachos man.
What?

07:19.605 --> 07:21.607
Now, prepare yourself.

07:21.691 --> 07:24.110
Your life is about
to be changed...

07:24.193 --> 07:24.944
forever.

07:25.027 --> 07:29.699
- [movie theme playing]

07:34.620 --> 07:37.623
- So good.
That's so good.

07:37.707 --> 07:38.374
- Oh.

07:38.457 --> 07:39.917
So, what do you think?

07:40.001 --> 07:43.087
Life changing
or just merely mind blowing.

07:43.171 --> 07:44.881
- Pass.

07:44.964 --> 07:46.757
- What?

07:46.841 --> 07:48.885
What could you have possibly
not liked about something

07:48.968 --> 07:50.511
that is perfect?

07:50.595 --> 07:52.555
- First of all
the heroes are Rando,

07:52.638 --> 07:55.391
an out of control pilot
who refuses to obey

07:55.474 --> 07:56.976
the light speed limit.

07:57.059 --> 07:59.729
And Orion, a selfish thief
who's constantly forgetting

07:59.812 --> 08:01.230
his girlfriend's birthdays.

08:01.314 --> 08:02.899
Not exactly good guys.

08:02.982 --> 08:05.234
- Oh, come on.

08:05.318 --> 08:06.986
Sometimes you have to break
a few rules to save the galaxy.

08:07.069 --> 08:08.446
- Break a few rules?

08:08.529 --> 08:11.657
They gamble,
they lie, they cheat.

08:11.741 --> 08:13.910
They shot Lord Moonslayer
into a black hole never to be

08:13.993 --> 08:15.244
seen again.

08:15.328 --> 08:16.746
- But Moonslayer was a bad guy.

08:16.829 --> 08:19.165
- A bad guy with a family.

08:20.166 --> 08:21.375
What are his kids gonna do
without Papa Moonslayer?

08:21.459 --> 08:24.086
Hmm? Who's gonna pay
their space rent?

08:24.170 --> 08:25.087
- Space rent?

08:25.171 --> 08:26.422
Did we just watch
the same movie? What...

08:26.505 --> 08:29.217
- Also, those crazy
names are so confusing.

08:29.300 --> 08:31.969
I mean what the heck is
a Beeboo?

08:32.053 --> 08:33.095
- Me.

08:33.179 --> 08:35.972
I'm Beeboo.

08:36.057 --> 08:36.933
- Look, I'm sorry.

08:37.015 --> 08:39.309
I didn't like it.
It's just my opinion.

08:39.393 --> 08:41.938
- Well your opinion is stupid.

08:42.020 --> 08:44.607
- I'm Beeboo.

08:44.690 --> 08:48.110
- Okay, you know what,
obviously I've touched a nerve.

08:48.194 --> 08:49.987
I'm just gonna go.

08:50.947 --> 08:53.115
- You know what?
I don't care what he says.

08:53.199 --> 08:55.451
These are the greatest movies
ever and I can't wait to see

08:55.534 --> 08:56.077
the new one tonight.

08:56.160 --> 08:59.121
- I'm Beeboo.

08:59.205 --> 09:00.122
- I know man.

09:00.206 --> 09:01.749
I know.

09:06.045 --> 09:08.256
- Uh, what happened
to all our chairs?

09:08.339 --> 09:10.299
- Oh, I put them in the back
so you and Zack will have to sit

09:10.383 --> 09:12.134
right next to each other...

09:12.218 --> 09:13.386
on the couch.

09:13.469 --> 09:14.971
- I like the way you think.

09:15.054 --> 09:17.139
- And I made just
one bowl of popcorn,

09:17.223 --> 09:20.768
so it will be easier
for you to accidentally touch...

09:20.851 --> 09:22.895
greasy, butter covered hands.

09:22.979 --> 09:25.982
- Ooh, romantic.

09:26.065 --> 09:28.651
This date with Zack never would
have happened without you.

09:28.734 --> 09:29.860
I just want to say
you two are the best.

09:29.944 --> 09:31.821
- We know.

09:31.904 --> 09:34.824
- Piper Delarosa-Stein,
at your service.

09:34.907 --> 09:36.325
- [doorbell rings]
- That's him.

09:36.409 --> 09:37.660
- Ooh!
We'll go out the back.

09:37.743 --> 09:38.911
- Eek!
- Good luck.

09:42.290 --> 09:45.751
- Hey, you...two.

09:45.835 --> 09:47.795
- Oh, Bella.
This is my girlfriend, Alesha.

09:47.878 --> 09:49.880
I hope it's okay I brought her.

09:49.964 --> 09:51.757
- Yeah, come...come in.
Sit down.

09:51.841 --> 09:55.553
It is absolutely okay
you brought your girlfriend...

09:55.636 --> 09:57.805
to our date night.

09:58.931 --> 10:01.809
So fun!

10:07.064 --> 10:09.066
- So, what's up, Zack...
and girlfriend?

10:09.150 --> 10:11.319
- It's Alesha.

10:11.402 --> 10:12.236
- Yeah, that's just how I talk.

10:12.320 --> 10:14.238
Like, what's up girlfriend?

10:14.322 --> 10:16.365
Hey there, girlfriend.

10:16.449 --> 10:18.784
Or...girlfriend?

10:21.162 --> 10:21.912
- Are we early?

10:21.996 --> 10:23.706
- Yeah, I thought
this was a party?

10:23.789 --> 10:25.875
- You thought this was a party?

10:25.958 --> 10:27.376
I thought this was a party too.

10:27.460 --> 10:30.254
So why's it so dark up in here?

10:30.338 --> 10:35.217
What light?
Swag. YOLO.

10:35.301 --> 10:37.720
Here, have some popcorn.

10:37.803 --> 10:40.681
Uh, I'll go see where
all the other party guests are.

10:43.851 --> 10:46.562
- Your hands are so buttery.

10:46.645 --> 10:50.232
- Oh you guys are
so adorable [retches].

10:50.316 --> 10:51.192
- You okay, Bella?

10:51.275 --> 10:53.361
- Oh, yeah.
I'm fine.

10:53.444 --> 10:54.070
I just swallowed my pride...bug.

10:54.153 --> 10:56.572
Pride bug.

10:56.655 --> 10:58.282
It's a thing.

11:00.743 --> 11:03.037
- He has a girlfriend?
When did that happen?

11:03.120 --> 11:05.247
- I don't know.
But he thought this was a party.

11:05.331 --> 11:08.834
So now it's me, Zack and stupid
Alesha on the worst date ever.

11:08.918 --> 11:10.044
I shouldn't call her stupid.
She seems nice.

11:10.127 --> 11:12.421
I like her bag.

11:12.505 --> 11:14.882
- Ooh, what does it look like?

11:14.965 --> 11:16.258
- It's big, but not too big.

11:16.342 --> 11:17.468
Leather, brown--

11:17.551 --> 11:18.427
- Focus!

11:18.511 --> 11:20.805
How do we get Bella out of this?

11:20.888 --> 11:24.016
- What if we turn it into
the party Zack was expecting?

11:24.100 --> 11:25.226
- That's great.

11:25.309 --> 11:27.311
And Zack will never know I was
asking him out and maybe

11:27.395 --> 11:30.314
I won't have to die of complete
humiliation and shame.

11:31.440 --> 11:33.025
- We'll start making calls
to get people over there.

11:33.109 --> 11:33.776
- Thanks.

11:36.862 --> 11:41.826
Well, hurry up because I want
to get this party jumping.

11:41.909 --> 11:44.453
Why are Silverado kids
always fashionably late?

11:44.537 --> 11:46.747
- Oh, cool.
Game just started.

11:46.831 --> 11:49.542
Hey, grab a seat
with me and Alesha.

11:49.625 --> 11:52.753
- Great.

11:56.715 --> 11:58.384
I like your bag.

12:04.348 --> 12:06.517
- [movie theme playing]

12:06.600 --> 12:08.811
- AUDIENCE: Yeah!

12:10.187 --> 12:12.523
- Galaxy Battle 4:
The Fight for Peace.

12:12.606 --> 12:14.650
- AUDIENCE: Yeah!

12:14.733 --> 12:17.027
- Newt has no idea
what he's talking about.

12:18.571 --> 12:20.656
- BEEBOO: [on screen] Come on!

12:20.739 --> 12:22.658
Move it or lose it Grandma.

12:22.741 --> 12:23.868
- [gunshots firing]

12:23.951 --> 12:26.579
- BEEBO: [on screen] What?
She was old anyway.

12:26.662 --> 12:28.330
- AUDIENCE: Yeah!

12:28.414 --> 12:31.375
- Okay, maybe Beeboo is
a little out of control.

12:31.459 --> 12:33.919
That could have been my grandma.

12:37.131 --> 12:39.133
- FEMALE: [on screen]
Orion Starfly,

12:39.216 --> 12:43.095
I can't believe you forgot
my birthday...again.

12:43.179 --> 12:45.306
- ORION STARFLY: [on screen]
Space kid, am I right?

12:45.389 --> 12:47.057
- [laughing]

12:47.141 --> 12:49.268
- Dang, bro.

12:49.351 --> 12:51.103
That's just cold.

12:55.649 --> 12:58.611
- Is it possible Newt was right
about our heroes being awful?

12:58.694 --> 12:59.987
- No, no.

13:00.070 --> 13:02.448
Orion and Beeboo are good dudes.

13:02.531 --> 13:03.741
I think.

13:03.824 --> 13:06.118
- Wait, what are they
doing with those kids?

13:06.202 --> 13:07.411
- ORION: [on screen]
We heard you kids wanted to see

13:07.495 --> 13:09.538
your Papa Moonslayer.

13:09.622 --> 13:10.998
Well you can join him...

13:11.081 --> 13:12.166
in the bottom
of this black hole!

13:12.249 --> 13:14.376
- AUDIENCE: Yeah!

13:14.460 --> 13:15.544
- Beeboo, no!

13:15.628 --> 13:17.046
- He did not just throw those
kids in the black hole.

13:17.129 --> 13:18.839
- Shh!

13:18.923 --> 13:20.049
We're trying to watch the movie.

13:20.132 --> 13:21.383
- Well let me tell
you how it goes.

13:21.467 --> 13:25.888
Orion and Rando fly around blow
things up and act like jerks.

13:25.971 --> 13:28.474
The end.
- AUDIENCE: Boo!

13:28.557 --> 13:30.809
- Guys, if you can't be quiet
I'm gonna have to ask you

13:30.893 --> 13:32.394
to leave.
- No problem.

13:32.478 --> 13:33.854
We're outta here.

13:33.938 --> 13:36.398
Can't watch anymore
of this trash.

13:40.986 --> 13:42.363
- There are so many
randoms in my house.

13:42.446 --> 13:44.406
- Sorry, Bella.

13:44.490 --> 13:45.908
It was last minute
and most people are out

13:45.991 --> 13:47.409
watching Galaxy Battle.

13:47.493 --> 13:49.537
- We got the coolest people
we could get on short notice.

13:49.620 --> 13:51.914
- Let's get this party started.

13:52.998 --> 13:55.584
- Slim pickings, huh?

13:55.668 --> 13:58.254
- Hey, Bella, my mom told me
never to come to someone's house

13:58.337 --> 13:59.672
empty-handed.

13:59.755 --> 14:01.882
So here you go.

14:01.966 --> 14:03.259
- Mustard packets?

14:03.342 --> 14:06.595
Thank you.

14:06.679 --> 14:09.640
- [cheering]

14:09.723 --> 14:10.933
- Oh, Zack's here.

14:11.016 --> 14:13.018
Any new developments
for my Silverado gossip show?

14:13.102 --> 14:15.688
- Oh, why don't you two
make yourselves at home...

14:15.771 --> 14:16.689
in another room.

14:16.772 --> 14:19.733
Upstairs even.

14:19.817 --> 14:21.443
That was close.

14:21.527 --> 14:22.444
- Hey, Bella.

14:22.528 --> 14:23.779
We're out of popcorn.

14:23.862 --> 14:25.281
Do you have any other
party snacks?

14:25.364 --> 14:26.740
- Party snacks?

14:26.824 --> 14:27.283
Oh, right.

14:27.366 --> 14:28.784
Party snacks.

14:28.867 --> 14:32.621
Would you please get
the other party snacks?

14:32.705 --> 14:34.999
- What?
- We're on it.

14:36.208 --> 14:39.878
- Chauncey, why are you wearing
my mom's flip-flops?

14:39.962 --> 14:42.381
- Oh, I thought these
were for the guest.

14:45.301 --> 14:45.926
- No.

14:46.010 --> 14:48.178
They aren't for the guests.

14:48.262 --> 14:52.558
- Well, I'm guessing this lamp
isn't for the guests either?

14:52.641 --> 14:53.892
- No.

14:53.976 --> 14:54.643
Put that back.

14:54.727 --> 14:57.438
- What kind of party is this?

14:59.356 --> 15:01.817
- What are those?

15:01.900 --> 15:02.693
- Raw broccoli sandwiches.

15:02.776 --> 15:04.987
- And a bowl of mayonnaise.

15:05.070 --> 15:08.907
Your mom really needs
to go grocery shopping.

15:08.991 --> 15:11.910
- Fine.
Put it on the snack table.

15:19.084 --> 15:20.628
- These are your party snacks?

15:20.711 --> 15:22.254
- Yeah, well...you know, I--

15:22.338 --> 15:24.423
- Ooh!

15:24.506 --> 15:28.594
Broccoli sandwiches...
and mayonnaise dipping sauce?

15:28.677 --> 15:29.678
- See?

15:29.762 --> 15:32.056
He gets it.

15:33.557 --> 15:36.352
- Yes I do.

15:36.435 --> 15:37.936
Mmm.

15:40.439 --> 15:43.692
- Bella, we somehow changed
this night from a total disaster

15:43.776 --> 15:47.071
to a...marginally
awkward get together.

15:47.488 --> 15:49.198
- Thank you.

15:49.281 --> 15:51.033
One more quarter
and I can get out of here

15:51.116 --> 15:53.410
without Zack and Alesha
finding out anything.

15:55.788 --> 15:56.705
- [cheering]

15:56.789 --> 15:59.208
- Double reverse
for the touchdown!

15:59.291 --> 16:00.876
- And did you see that
stiff arm...insane.

16:00.959 --> 16:02.044
- Oh, yes.

16:02.127 --> 16:02.961
That dude is a beast.

16:03.045 --> 16:05.381
- I'm just gonna go get us
some snacks.

16:05.464 --> 16:06.256
- Oh thanks.

16:06.340 --> 16:07.758
I totally could
have taken that guy.

16:07.841 --> 16:08.550
- No way.
He was so fast.

16:08.634 --> 16:11.053
- Like I couldn't beat him.

16:11.136 --> 16:13.639
- This is the most awkward
party I've ever been to.

16:13.722 --> 16:15.182
- This isn't even
really a party.

16:15.265 --> 16:16.725
- What are you talking about?

16:16.809 --> 16:20.896
- Well, I was in the coat closet
looking for some flip-flips

16:20.979 --> 16:21.814
and I overheard
Pepper and Sophie.

16:21.897 --> 16:24.024
Apparently Bella asked out Zack.

16:24.108 --> 16:27.236
But he misunderstood
and brought his girlfriend.

16:27.319 --> 16:29.863
So Bella threw
this fake party.

16:29.947 --> 16:31.156
- She did?

16:31.240 --> 16:32.783
- I feel bad for Zack's
girlfriend because it looks like

16:32.866 --> 16:36.203
things are really
working out for Bella.

16:37.830 --> 16:39.748
- I'm Mace.
This is Chauncey.

16:39.832 --> 16:40.457
And you are?

16:40.541 --> 16:42.584
- Zack's girlfriend.

16:42.668 --> 16:43.752
- Oh.

16:43.836 --> 16:45.671
Ooh...

16:46.672 --> 16:48.424
- Zack, I'm gonna go.

16:48.507 --> 16:49.967
- Alesha?

16:50.050 --> 16:52.136
- ZACK: What...what's wrong?

16:55.055 --> 16:57.725
- What did you guys just do?

16:57.808 --> 17:00.144
- See this...this is why we
don't get invited to parties.

17:09.987 --> 17:11.905
- Newt, we just watched
Galaxy Battle 4.

17:11.989 --> 17:13.115
We want to tell you something.

17:13.198 --> 17:14.907
- Guys, if you're here
to tell me it's awesome.

17:14.992 --> 17:16.617
I don't really--
- No, you were so right.

17:16.702 --> 17:19.121
Those movies are terrible
and we owe you an apology.

17:19.204 --> 17:22.290
- Yeah, our heroes are
awful people.

17:22.374 --> 17:24.292
Did you know that Starfly
and Beeboo tossed

17:24.376 --> 17:25.544
Lord Moonslayer's kids
into a black hole?

17:25.627 --> 17:28.297
His kids, man!

17:28.380 --> 17:31.925
- And even worse, Beeboo was
just speeding across the galaxy

17:32.009 --> 17:34.094
without wearing a seatbelt.

17:34.178 --> 17:35.637
- Swear, I don't think
that's worse.

17:35.721 --> 17:37.055
- Agree to disagree.

17:37.139 --> 17:38.098
- Do you even know
what a black hole is?

17:38.182 --> 17:41.268
- Seatbelts save lives.
- Guys, stop.

17:41.351 --> 17:43.812
After leaving your place I felt
bad about insulting the movies

17:43.896 --> 17:45.147
you guys love so much.

17:45.230 --> 17:46.523
So I went out and saw
the new one on my own.

17:46.607 --> 17:48.942
- You did?
- Really?

17:49.026 --> 17:51.862
- Yeah, and it was...awesome!

17:51.945 --> 17:54.656
Starfly was like
bazoom-vroom-vroom,

17:54.740 --> 17:56.116
pachew-chew.

17:56.200 --> 17:57.868
And Beeboo was
flying around like vroom.

17:57.951 --> 18:01.246
Move it or lose it, Grandma!

18:01.330 --> 18:03.665
Boom!

18:03.749 --> 18:04.833
- I don't understand.

18:04.917 --> 18:05.417
You said you hated
the first one.

18:05.501 --> 18:07.586
- Yeah.

18:07.669 --> 18:09.671
But after seeing the new one
I realized I was focusing

18:09.755 --> 18:10.589
on the wrong thing.

18:10.672 --> 18:12.800
Sure Orion and Beeboo
could be jerks,

18:12.883 --> 18:16.428
but sometimes you have to break
a few rules to save the galaxy.

18:16.512 --> 18:17.638
And, to be honest,
Moonslayer's kids were

18:17.721 --> 18:19.640
such brats.

18:19.723 --> 18:22.184
I would have thrown them
in a black hole too.

18:22.267 --> 18:24.019
- Wait a minute, you've ruined
our favorite movies series

18:24.102 --> 18:27.397
of all time for us
and now you love it?

18:27.481 --> 18:28.690
- Guilty.

18:28.774 --> 18:31.068
- Not cool, Newt.

18:31.151 --> 18:32.986
- Should throw you
in a black hole.

18:33.070 --> 18:34.613
- Come on, guys.
Don't be mad.

18:34.696 --> 18:37.199
Wait, check it out.

18:37.282 --> 18:39.660
I'm Tuc-Tuc Corduroy.

18:39.743 --> 18:42.037
Blaaah!

18:42.120 --> 18:43.622
Guys, come on.

18:43.705 --> 18:45.374
Blaaah!

18:45.457 --> 18:47.751
See she likes it.
She likes it.

18:52.464 --> 18:53.590
- Zack, is everything okay?

18:53.674 --> 18:56.760
- No, Alesha, wants to leave
but won't even tell me why.

18:56.844 --> 18:58.637
- I don't know what happened
but she doesn't even want

18:58.720 --> 19:01.473
to see me right now.

19:02.641 --> 19:03.642
- Poor guy.

19:03.725 --> 19:05.936
He looks so heartbroken.

19:06.019 --> 19:07.938
- But on the bright side...

19:08.021 --> 19:13.026
Sorry, I thought
enough time has passed.

19:13.110 --> 19:14.653
- This is my fault.

19:14.736 --> 19:16.363
I have to fix it.

19:22.911 --> 19:23.912
Are you okay?

19:23.996 --> 19:25.122
- I'm fine.

19:25.205 --> 19:26.623
I'm just waiting
for my brother to pick me up.

19:26.707 --> 19:28.917
- Alesha, I--

19:29.001 --> 19:31.336
- Look, I know you tried to ask
out Zack and are having

19:31.420 --> 19:32.838
this party to cover it up.

19:32.921 --> 19:35.924
- Yeah.
I look like an idiot.

19:36.008 --> 19:38.427
If I knew he was with someone
I would have never asked him out

19:38.510 --> 19:40.345
in the first place.
- Really?

19:40.429 --> 19:43.432
Because you and Zack sure looked
like you were having a good time

19:43.515 --> 19:45.601
in there.
- No, I wasn't.

19:45.684 --> 19:46.810
Okay, I was.

19:46.894 --> 19:47.644
But...but I don't want him.

19:47.728 --> 19:51.773
Okay, I did.

19:51.857 --> 19:54.484
Look, I'm not trying to mess up
anything for the two of you.

19:54.568 --> 19:55.569
- Really?

19:55.652 --> 19:57.613
- Yes.

19:57.696 --> 19:59.907
Look I promise
I'll stay away from Zack.

19:59.990 --> 20:00.782
No calls, no texts, no parties.

20:00.866 --> 20:03.160
He's all yours.

20:03.243 --> 20:04.786
Does that work?

20:04.870 --> 20:07.956
- Yeah, that works.

20:08.040 --> 20:08.999
- Great.

20:09.082 --> 20:11.251
Then go in there
and get your guy...

20:14.546 --> 20:15.756
girlfriend.

20:17.883 --> 20:19.885
Sausage and biscuits!

20:23.180 --> 20:23.889
- Alesha, look,
I'm not sure what--

20:23.972 --> 20:24.973
- Don't worry, Zack.

20:25.057 --> 20:27.643
It was just a misunderstanding.

20:27.726 --> 20:29.394
Bella straightened
everything out.

20:29.478 --> 20:29.811
- Bella?

20:29.895 --> 20:31.813
Wow thanks.

20:31.897 --> 20:34.775
- No problem...bro.

20:36.109 --> 20:38.695
- Uh, well, I guess Alesha
and I are gonna get going.

20:38.779 --> 20:39.988
- Okay.

20:40.072 --> 20:40.489
Bye, Alesha.

20:40.572 --> 20:43.200
Bye, Zack.

20:45.202 --> 20:47.704
- It was the right
thing to do, mama.

20:47.788 --> 20:49.122
- Yeah.

20:49.206 --> 20:50.874
Doesn't mean it doesn't hurt.

20:50.958 --> 20:52.709
- Hey, Bella, where'd
your mom get these flip-flops?

20:52.793 --> 20:55.462
They're so snazzy.

20:57.756 --> 20:59.466
- Okay, party's over.

20:59.549 --> 21:02.010
Get out!

21:02.094 --> 21:03.261
- I'm taking the lamp.

21:09.643 --> 21:10.644
- So good.

21:10.727 --> 21:13.146
So good.

21:14.106 --> 21:17.109
Well, that was
"The Wedding Detective".

21:17.192 --> 21:18.527
Now, fair is fair.

21:18.610 --> 21:19.695
Rip it apart.

21:19.778 --> 21:21.196
- Actually I liked it.

21:21.279 --> 21:23.240
- It was dope.
- What?

21:23.323 --> 21:25.117
- Yeah, I mean
it's actually pretty clever.

21:25.200 --> 21:26.827
How a movie called
"The Wedding Detective" is

21:26.910 --> 21:29.413
totally anti-love.
- Mmhm.

21:29.496 --> 21:31.248
- Uh, no, no, no.
That's not what the--

21:31.331 --> 21:32.916
- Yeah, that's what
the movie is saying.

21:33.000 --> 21:34.751
Love is evil.

21:34.835 --> 21:36.336
- What?
No, no, no, no.

21:36.420 --> 21:38.505
I'm not listening.
Love is beautiful.

21:42.634 --> 21:43.760
- Well played my man.

21:43.844 --> 21:44.845
We ruined
his favorite movie series.

21:44.928 --> 21:47.806
- Had to be done.

21:47.889 --> 21:50.809
So, erm,

21:50.892 --> 21:52.102
you want to watch
the second one?

21:52.185 --> 21:54.354
- Heck you.
I thought they were super cute.
