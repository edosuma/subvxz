WEBVTT

01:48.630 --> 01:50.110
Tobias!

01:52.373 --> 01:53.765
Tobias!

02:02.905 --> 02:04.167
That'’s okay.

02:06.169 --> 02:07.605
There we go.

02:14.873 --> 02:15.874
You'’re okay, right?

02:16.048 --> 02:18.529
Tobias!

02:18.703 --> 02:20.183
Tobias!

02:27.930 --> 02:28.974
Tobias.

02:36.156 --> 02:37.548
Here, hold it down!

02:37.722 --> 02:38.680
Yes, sir!

02:39.463 --> 02:41.117
Where'’s your sister?

02:41.291 --> 02:43.032
She'’s fetching what she can
from the well.

02:43.206 --> 02:46.035
We can distill
our drinking water
from the snow.

02:46.209 --> 02:47.689
Hitch up Fable
and go fetch her.

02:47.863 --> 02:48.907
Time is wasting.

02:49.081 --> 02:50.126
Yes, sir.

03:08.013 --> 03:09.319
We have to go.

03:09.493 --> 03:11.452
It'’s too early
for a storm like this.

03:11.626 --> 03:13.802
We'’ve held as long
as we can.

03:13.976 --> 03:16.283
We have
to get off this mountain
or we'’ll starve.

03:16.457 --> 03:19.024
Freeze or starve?
It seems the Lord
has forsaken us.

03:19.199 --> 03:20.330
He is testing us.

03:20.504 --> 03:21.766
And the children?

03:23.246 --> 03:25.770
The Lord
be a capricious fiend
if he tries the helpless.

03:25.944 --> 03:27.119
Hush, Mother!

03:33.996 --> 03:35.476
We can brave the storm.

03:37.434 --> 03:39.044
We'’ll be safe
in the valley.

03:40.350 --> 03:42.091
We should never
have come here.

03:47.096 --> 03:49.272
Abigale!

03:55.322 --> 03:56.453
Abigale!

03:57.759 --> 03:59.413
Abigale!

03:59.587 --> 04:01.284
You know better
than to venture
beyond the path at night.

04:01.458 --> 04:02.546
I just wanted to--

04:02.720 --> 04:04.244
What is snow made of?

04:04.418 --> 04:05.984
Water.

04:06.158 --> 04:08.073
You are not to wander
out of my sight

04:08.248 --> 04:09.597
without your Pa
or Tobias.

04:09.771 --> 04:11.512
Is that understood?Yes, ma'’am.

04:12.817 --> 04:14.428
Finish stowing the wagon

04:15.429 --> 04:17.735
so we can leave
this horrid place.

04:20.260 --> 04:21.957
Have faith in your father.

04:23.001 --> 04:24.742
He will get us
off the mountain.

04:24.916 --> 04:26.048
Have faith.

04:26.744 --> 04:28.442
Have faith.

04:28.616 --> 04:33.142
We must have faith
that our suffering
has a reason

04:34.839 --> 04:37.494
and that by the grace of God
we will be delivered.

04:39.191 --> 04:42.978
"Blessed is the one
who endureth these trials.

04:43.979 --> 04:45.981
For having stood the test,

04:46.155 --> 04:48.375
he will receive
the crown of life,

04:48.549 --> 04:50.594
which the Lord
hath promised those

04:50.768 --> 04:52.292
who persevere in love.

04:53.684 --> 04:56.861
And you shall pass
through the river,

04:57.035 --> 04:59.255
but the water
will not wash over you.

04:59.429 --> 05:03.607
And you shall walk
through the fire,
but you shall not be burned.

05:03.781 --> 05:06.741
No, the flames
will not set you ablaze,

05:06.915 --> 05:10.484
for always as you walk,
I am with you."

05:10.658 --> 05:14.488
"Consider it pure joy,
brothers and sisters,

05:14.662 --> 05:17.012
when you face
diverse trials,

05:17.186 --> 05:22.626
for these trials
worketh patience
and compassion.

05:22.800 --> 05:28.023
Let patience and compassion
have her perfect work,

05:28.197 --> 05:31.853
that ye may be perfect
and entire,

05:32.027 --> 05:33.420
lacking nothing."

06:28.910 --> 06:30.955
We got out
from underneath the storm.

06:32.261 --> 06:34.176
Why have we stopped?

06:34.350 --> 06:35.830
He'’s no spring colt.

06:36.004 --> 06:38.267
He'’ll drop from exhaustion,
we push him too hard.

06:39.616 --> 06:41.444
This is a good place
to camp.

06:45.927 --> 06:47.058
Tobias.

06:48.799 --> 06:50.105
You scout ahead.

06:51.367 --> 06:54.370
Make sure there'’s not
a better spot to set up camp.

06:56.503 --> 06:57.895
If you don'’t object.

06:59.157 --> 07:00.202
I don'’t.

07:07.514 --> 07:08.558
Abigale.

07:09.777 --> 07:12.606
Stay here,
gather snow for water.

07:34.149 --> 07:35.846
You mind your work, girl.

07:36.020 --> 07:37.979
There'’s no need
to court misfortune.

07:46.030 --> 07:46.857
Well...

07:47.031 --> 07:48.642
How many we got left?

07:48.816 --> 07:50.600
Only need one.

07:54.430 --> 07:55.779
Right.

07:56.563 --> 07:57.781
Can I load it?

08:36.777 --> 08:37.778
There you go.

08:40.694 --> 08:41.695
Yeah.

08:43.479 --> 08:45.525
Ah, tamp it.
Slowly.

08:48.136 --> 08:50.225
We can'’t risk it
jamming up on us.

08:51.226 --> 08:52.227
Easy.

08:54.621 --> 08:55.622
Good.

09:18.035 --> 09:19.254
Good.

09:22.431 --> 09:23.650
Can I go?

09:24.868 --> 09:26.435
Your place is here,
sweetheart.

09:27.262 --> 09:28.568
We won'’t be long.

09:50.894 --> 09:52.679
Goddamn it!

09:53.854 --> 09:55.072
What are you standing
around for?

09:55.246 --> 09:57.292
Go after him
while I reload.Yes, sir.

10:28.889 --> 10:30.499
You might'’ve got her!

12:26.136 --> 12:27.572
Quiet, boy.

12:27.747 --> 12:29.400
They could still be here.

13:03.870 --> 13:05.480
Shh.

13:05.654 --> 13:07.003
We'’re not gonna hurt you!
We'’re not gonna hurt you.

13:07.177 --> 13:08.744
Shh. Miss. Miss.

13:08.918 --> 13:09.832
Shh.

13:10.006 --> 13:11.355
Miss, we'’re on your side.

13:11.529 --> 13:14.576
Miss, it'’s not safe.
You have to be quiet.

13:14.750 --> 13:15.838
Quiet.

13:16.012 --> 13:18.101
Shh.

13:18.275 --> 13:20.538
Shh.

13:28.982 --> 13:30.679
Tobi-- Tobias.

13:30.853 --> 13:31.854
Yeah.

13:33.638 --> 13:35.031
Snap off the arrow, huh?

13:35.205 --> 13:37.251
What? No, no.

13:37.425 --> 13:39.035
No! No! No!

13:43.170 --> 13:44.562
Shh.

13:53.876 --> 13:56.705
I saw some moss.
A few of the trees
when we came in.

13:56.879 --> 13:58.054
Go.
Collect as much
as you can.

13:58.228 --> 13:59.360
Go, go.Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

13:59.534 --> 14:01.884
And get two thin branches.
Go.

14:02.058 --> 14:03.059
Got you.

14:03.233 --> 14:05.105
Okay. All right.
Shh.

14:06.323 --> 14:08.673
Hey, hey, hey.
None of that,
none of that.

14:08.848 --> 14:09.936
Stay awake.

14:10.110 --> 14:11.720
What'’s your name?

14:11.894 --> 14:13.113
What'’s your name?

14:13.722 --> 14:14.679
Cassidy.

14:14.854 --> 14:16.290
I'’m Abraham.

14:16.464 --> 14:17.813
Do you know what happened?

14:21.556 --> 14:22.992
You have family elsewhere?

14:35.091 --> 14:37.050
You'’re welcome
to join my family.

14:38.921 --> 14:40.444
We'’re gonna take--

14:42.533 --> 14:45.362
We'’ll take--
We'’ll take you somewhere safe.

14:49.758 --> 14:51.499
Here.Strip the bark
from the wood.

14:51.673 --> 14:53.283
Yes, sir.

14:53.457 --> 14:55.546
What-- What--
What are you doing?

14:55.720 --> 14:58.636
What are you doing?I have nothing
to stitch your hand with.

14:59.463 --> 15:00.464
All right.

15:01.465 --> 15:02.510
All right.

15:04.599 --> 15:05.861
Hold steady.
Breathe.

15:06.035 --> 15:07.254
Breathe deep,
breathe deep.

15:08.690 --> 15:09.691
Breathe deep.

15:09.865 --> 15:11.127
Tobias.

15:11.301 --> 15:12.346
It'’s ready.

15:12.520 --> 15:14.478
Moss. Okay.

15:14.652 --> 15:17.525
Take two sticks
and place '’em
on both sides of her arm.

15:17.699 --> 15:19.048
Yes, sir.

15:20.615 --> 15:23.313
Okay.
Put '’em in her coat.
Put '’em in her coat.

15:23.487 --> 15:25.576
Hold them there.
Yeah, hold them.

15:25.750 --> 15:28.449
Hold them,
but keep '’em tight.Yes, sir.

15:29.929 --> 15:30.930
Oh!

15:34.107 --> 15:35.760
Okay.

15:35.935 --> 15:38.502
All right.
Brace yourself, Cassidy.
This is gonna hurt.

15:50.514 --> 15:52.168
Where did you learn
to do that?

15:54.692 --> 15:56.956
I was a medic
during the war.

15:59.654 --> 16:01.612
We had to make do
with whatever we had.

16:11.666 --> 16:12.667
Let'’s finish the job.

16:14.930 --> 16:15.975
Okay.

17:00.149 --> 17:01.498
Fetch a needle
and thread, Mother.

17:01.672 --> 17:03.370
Mama!
Quickly!

17:03.544 --> 17:05.633
Oh, God.
What on earth?

17:07.243 --> 17:09.028
Here.
Clear out that chair.

17:09.202 --> 17:10.681
What happened
to her?

17:11.900 --> 17:14.816
She, uh...
She was--

17:14.990 --> 17:16.383
Her party, uh...

17:17.906 --> 17:21.388
Tobias found her camp.
She'’s lucky to be alive.

17:23.868 --> 17:25.479
Mother,
where'’s the thread?

17:25.653 --> 17:27.046
I...Mother.

17:27.220 --> 17:29.526
I got it.We couldn'’t abandon her.

17:30.179 --> 17:32.138
No, of course not.

17:32.312 --> 17:35.271
I don'’t think
they'’re infected.
Not yet, at least.

17:35.967 --> 17:37.665
We'’ll know come dawn.

17:37.839 --> 17:39.406
Tobias, finish the hunt.

17:39.580 --> 17:40.581
Yes, sir.

17:42.670 --> 17:43.801
You did well today.

18:15.703 --> 18:18.053
You ready?
I got you. I got you.

18:21.796 --> 18:24.973
Yep. I got you.

18:25.147 --> 18:26.801
It'’s all right,
Miss.

18:26.975 --> 18:28.759
You'’re safe.
Pa will take good
care of you, I promise.

18:28.933 --> 18:30.892
There, there.
There, there now.

18:31.066 --> 18:32.720
There.
There now.

18:34.896 --> 18:37.420
All right.

18:37.594 --> 18:38.769
I got you, I got you.

18:38.943 --> 18:41.076
There. There now.

18:46.342 --> 18:48.431
Hold it still.I got you-- I got her.

18:48.605 --> 18:49.998
Hold it still.I got you.
I got you.

18:51.478 --> 18:52.479
All right.

18:55.482 --> 18:56.874
All right,
all right.

18:57.048 --> 18:58.572
That'’s it.
That'’s it, honey.

18:58.746 --> 19:01.183
That'’s it, honey.
Are you okay?

19:01.357 --> 19:03.403
Are you okay? Yeah?

19:03.577 --> 19:04.578
Yeah.

19:06.275 --> 19:09.713
All right.

19:09.887 --> 19:11.062
Okay.

19:11.237 --> 19:13.195
Stay with me.
Stay with me.

19:13.369 --> 19:14.588
Stay with me, dear.

19:14.762 --> 19:16.024
It'’s almost done.

19:16.198 --> 19:18.113
Stay with me. Stay with me.

19:18.287 --> 19:20.071
There now.
There now.

19:20.246 --> 19:21.856
Abigale,
help her in the wagon.

19:44.139 --> 19:45.619
You'’re safe with us.

19:47.360 --> 19:49.100
None of us are.

20:10.296 --> 20:13.995
We need to be gone
before daybreak.

20:15.866 --> 20:18.608
Whoever attacked her
might still be close by.

20:18.782 --> 20:20.784
You could'’ve led them
right to us.

20:23.047 --> 20:25.354
No one was around
as far as I could see.

20:28.705 --> 20:30.446
We couldn'’t just
leave her there.

20:31.708 --> 20:33.710
There'’s barely enough food
to feed ourselves,

20:33.884 --> 20:35.277
let alone a stray.

20:57.343 --> 20:59.083
This was all you could find?

20:59.258 --> 21:01.347
It'’s something, Abraham.

21:05.133 --> 21:07.483
We must'’ve lost the ammunition
at the other camp.

21:15.709 --> 21:16.971
And you caught these how?

21:17.145 --> 21:20.714
I made a snare.
Like you taught me.

21:26.372 --> 21:27.634
I'’ll brine it overnight.

21:27.808 --> 21:31.377
Do you need help?No, it won'’t take long.

21:32.552 --> 21:33.553
You rest.

21:34.423 --> 21:35.729
You'’ve done too much today.

24:28.336 --> 24:31.774
I'’ll take the man.
You take the woman.

25:57.556 --> 25:59.514
Hey. Hey.

25:59.688 --> 26:01.516
Don'’t you touch her.
Don'’t you touch her.

26:01.690 --> 26:02.691
Don'’t touch her.

26:10.220 --> 26:13.180
Darling, I'’ve missed you.

Shut the fuck up!

26:59.574 --> 27:02.011
You don'’t think
I have a good singing voice?

27:02.185 --> 27:04.144
I'’ve been told
I have the voice
of an angel.

27:04.318 --> 27:06.973
Ooh!What motherfucker
told you that?

27:07.147 --> 27:09.715
Well, funny enough,
it was your mother.

27:09.889 --> 27:11.847
She told me
while I was fucking her.

27:15.677 --> 27:17.374
You think
that shit'’s funny,
Felix?

27:18.201 --> 27:19.681
No. No, I don'’t think that.

27:19.855 --> 27:21.596
You think it'’s funny, boy?No. No, I don'’t.

27:21.770 --> 27:23.206
He thinks
it'’s very funny.

27:23.380 --> 27:25.295
Ah, hell with all y'’all.

27:25.469 --> 27:27.950
Oh, Rhys,
there'’s no reason
for you to be upset.

27:28.124 --> 27:30.605
If anything, I'’m the one
who should be upset.

27:30.779 --> 27:33.173
Yeah?
Why is that, Logan?

27:33.347 --> 27:36.263
Because I thought
I was the only one
fucking your mother.

27:37.830 --> 27:39.962
Whoo!

27:41.834 --> 27:43.574
Gentlemen, enough.
We'’ve crossed a line.

27:43.749 --> 27:45.228
Apologies, Rhys.

27:45.402 --> 27:47.404
And since you are new here,

27:47.578 --> 27:50.190
I'’d like to gift you
this song.

27:50.364 --> 27:51.626
Brody!

27:51.800 --> 27:54.847
♪ The trumpet sounds♪

27:55.021 --> 27:58.154
♪ The colors
They do fly, me boys♪

27:58.328 --> 28:01.288
♪ To fight, kill, or wound♪

29:36.600 --> 29:38.080
Let'’s skin the rabbit.

29:42.868 --> 29:45.566
Ooh!

29:45.740 --> 29:51.180
All work and no play
makes Jack a dull boy!

29:51.354 --> 29:56.490
What say you?
Left bank or right?

29:57.839 --> 30:03.845
In this hand,
1864 Château Lafite.

30:04.019 --> 30:07.457
Dominant grape,
Cabernet Sauvignon.

30:07.631 --> 30:10.199
Sturdy vintage,
to be sure.

30:10.373 --> 30:15.465
Characterized by notes
of smoke, incense tar
and saddle leather.

30:15.639 --> 30:19.643
Thomas Jefferson himself
never drank its like.

30:19.818 --> 30:21.297
Brody?Dang!

30:22.559 --> 30:24.039
Well said.

30:24.213 --> 30:28.522
And in this hand,
a more recent Saint-EÉmilion,

30:28.696 --> 30:30.089
a Merlot.

30:30.263 --> 30:34.006
Redolent of blackberry, spice,
vanilla and jam.

30:35.834 --> 30:40.229
Both bottles liberated
from their oppressors!

30:40.403 --> 30:43.145
Whoo!En route across
our territory!

30:43.319 --> 30:45.931
Whoo!To the San Francisco
boomtown.

30:46.105 --> 30:47.106
Felix?

30:47.280 --> 30:48.542
It'’s real good.
Thank you.

30:50.022 --> 30:54.287
Here, my friend.
Take both.

30:55.244 --> 30:56.985
They'’re each worth
about $40.

30:57.159 --> 30:58.987
Whoo.

31:00.336 --> 31:01.729
Enjoy.

31:06.952 --> 31:08.867
Don'’t know
why we'’re celebratin'’.

31:09.041 --> 31:10.477
Anything good?

31:10.651 --> 31:13.262
Shit and more shit. Hey!
Get your hand out of there.

31:14.698 --> 31:16.787
We could probably get something
for the horse.

31:16.962 --> 31:20.574
She'’s worth more as glue.Yeah.

31:20.748 --> 31:23.882
There'’s only one thing
in this camp worth a shit,

31:24.056 --> 31:27.320
and that shit
belongs to Logan.

32:20.025 --> 32:22.418
God, it'’s good
to have you back.

32:23.419 --> 32:24.855
It'’s good to be warm.

32:29.686 --> 32:31.210
They was decent folk.

32:32.298 --> 32:34.474
Most would'’ve just put me
out of my misery.

32:36.737 --> 32:38.260
Is that what you want?

32:40.262 --> 32:41.916
You know it'’s not.

32:43.613 --> 32:46.529
After last time, who knows
what I know about you.

32:53.493 --> 32:54.581
But they...

32:59.281 --> 33:01.849
Let me fix that for you.

33:11.946 --> 33:15.558
If you hadn'’t tried to run,
we wouldn'’t have
had to do that to you.

33:18.779 --> 33:20.433
If you try and run again...

33:24.567 --> 33:26.004
it'’ll be much worse,
savvy?

33:37.754 --> 33:38.799
Yes.

33:40.235 --> 33:41.932
Oh!

33:47.590 --> 33:49.070
Oh!

34:00.081 --> 34:02.649
You didn'’t bring me
all the way here
just to shoot me.

34:02.823 --> 34:04.346
I wouldn'’t waste a bullet
on you.

34:04.520 --> 34:05.565
Mmm.

34:08.481 --> 34:09.525
Hey.

34:11.179 --> 34:12.833
Leave her out of this.

34:13.007 --> 34:15.749
You were about her age
when you started.

34:17.446 --> 34:22.538
The way I see it,
you can show her the way
we do things around here.

34:24.888 --> 34:26.890
Or I can put you both
out of my misery.

34:27.065 --> 34:28.718
Hmm?

34:28.892 --> 34:30.981
Okay!
Okay. Okay.

34:31.156 --> 34:32.592
Hey.

34:36.552 --> 34:38.250
Just don'’t hurt her.

34:41.209 --> 34:43.081
Holster my guns.

34:51.567 --> 34:52.916
Don'’t drop '’em.

35:46.274 --> 35:47.797
Mmm.

36:27.010 --> 36:29.535
If Logan catches you,
he'’ll kill us both.

36:31.232 --> 36:33.147
You brought me here.
Help me.

36:33.321 --> 36:35.280
Them boys out there
aren'’t so bad.

36:35.454 --> 36:37.282
Just do what they want,
you'’ll be okay.

36:37.456 --> 36:40.023
And what do they want?
To whore me out?

36:40.937 --> 36:42.983
No, nothing like that.

36:44.506 --> 36:45.986
Then what?

36:47.814 --> 36:50.251
Get folks to stop
on the road,
take me in.

36:54.473 --> 36:55.561
It was you.

36:56.736 --> 36:58.390
You don'’t know what
you'’re talking about--

36:58.564 --> 37:00.783
My family'’s dead
because of you!I never killed no one.

37:00.957 --> 37:02.568
Fuck you!I saved your life.

37:02.742 --> 37:05.005
I wish you'’d
just killed me instead!

37:06.354 --> 37:07.312
You don'’t mean that.

37:09.183 --> 37:10.489
Leave me alone.

37:11.446 --> 37:13.231
Leave me alone! Go!

37:46.829 --> 37:48.309
Where'’d you get that?

37:48.483 --> 37:50.093
Ah, found it.

37:50.268 --> 37:51.399
Stole it,
more like.

37:53.096 --> 37:56.012
We'’re thieves.
Practicing.

38:04.456 --> 38:07.110
How come
you'’re not wearing gloves?

38:07.285 --> 38:09.112
Don'’t that hurt?No.

38:09.287 --> 38:11.201
Well, why in the hell not?

38:14.857 --> 38:17.904
All right, all right.
Okay.

38:19.209 --> 38:20.646
What you doing, man?

38:21.734 --> 38:23.039
What the fuck you doing, man?

38:23.910 --> 38:25.041
Watch this.

38:26.347 --> 38:27.479
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

38:28.654 --> 38:29.698
Cut it out!

38:31.744 --> 38:32.788
Stop it!

38:32.962 --> 38:34.137
Quit it, man.

38:35.182 --> 38:37.315
Stop!
You'’re fucking crazy, man!

38:42.450 --> 38:44.060
I don'’t feel nothin'’.

38:45.410 --> 38:47.325
I'’ve been that way
my whole life.

38:48.413 --> 38:51.024
Doctors got no explanation
for it.

38:52.199 --> 38:53.505
I don'’t feel nothin'’.

39:01.556 --> 39:05.604
This trade here,
I learned in the workhouse.

39:05.778 --> 39:09.695
I work.
You'’re just takin'’ up space.

39:09.869 --> 39:11.218
I got my uses.

39:11.392 --> 39:13.351
Yeah, tippin'’ that bottle
ain'’t useful.

39:13.525 --> 39:15.788
Fuck you.I'’m good.

39:15.962 --> 39:19.400
I'’m just waitin'’ on Logan,
then.

39:19.574 --> 39:22.795
Why don'’t you
make yourself useful,
let him know.

39:23.796 --> 39:24.884
Not you.

39:27.887 --> 39:29.410
Hey, I'’m talking to you, Brody.

39:32.370 --> 39:33.371
Now.

39:41.030 --> 39:43.076
Put your fuckin'’ britches on.

39:43.250 --> 39:44.730
I'’m comin'’ in.

39:45.644 --> 39:47.297
Y'’all decent?

39:47.863 --> 39:49.517
Aw, fuck.

39:49.691 --> 39:52.041
Y'’all is decent.

39:52.215 --> 39:56.045
I was hoping
you'’d be in mid-orgy
or some shit.

39:56.219 --> 39:59.005
What-- What is that
you call it? Uh...

39:59.179 --> 40:02.312
A ménage à trois?
"Menagerie de todd!"

40:02.487 --> 40:04.619
Someday, maybe.

40:04.793 --> 40:06.621
Yes, bonne chance.

40:06.795 --> 40:08.710
And please knock
before entering
from now on.

40:08.884 --> 40:10.146
Were you raised
in a barn?

40:10.320 --> 40:11.583
Yes, sir, I was.

40:14.368 --> 40:15.848
The horses are ready.

40:17.719 --> 40:19.068
Whenever you are.

40:19.242 --> 40:20.983
In a moment.

40:21.157 --> 40:25.510
All right.
There'’s a storm comin'’ up
over the ridge.

40:26.815 --> 40:29.383
I'’m gonna get my chaps on,
get ready.

40:29.557 --> 40:31.777
Get the girl ready.
She'’ll be joining us.

40:37.478 --> 40:38.479
She ain'’t ready.

40:38.653 --> 40:41.351
Well, she'’ll learn.
You did.

40:41.526 --> 40:43.528
Put her on the trail,
she'’s gonna run.

40:43.702 --> 40:46.095
She can'’t outrun
a bullet.

41:01.197 --> 41:03.373
Let go of me!

41:03.548 --> 41:05.637
Put me down!You motherfucker!

41:08.596 --> 41:09.902
Let me go!

41:13.340 --> 41:14.820
Stop it!

41:17.953 --> 41:19.259
Let me go!

41:25.265 --> 41:27.702
Untie me and let me go!You bitch!

41:32.141 --> 41:35.493
You see this?
You gotta contain yourself,
woman.

41:35.667 --> 41:39.235
I'’m gonna cut your ropes--

41:43.501 --> 41:45.981
I think we'’ll just keep
the ropes on then, shall we?

41:46.155 --> 41:48.114
We'’ve got business
to attend to.

41:48.288 --> 41:49.768
Okay?

42:20.799 --> 42:22.322
It'’s a day away,
at least.

42:22.496 --> 42:24.367
I don'’t like
the look of it.

42:24.542 --> 42:27.240
We need to keep the storm
at our backs.

42:27.414 --> 42:28.720
What you thinkin'’?

42:30.809 --> 42:33.246
You bring
the German?Of course.

42:46.607 --> 42:49.697
It'’s a crossroads
next to a split pine.

42:49.871 --> 42:50.872
See it?

42:52.265 --> 42:54.397
Uh-huh.We can plant
the girls there

42:54.572 --> 42:56.399
and wait it out
further down.

42:56.574 --> 42:58.271
Should we do
a walk-around first?

42:58.445 --> 43:00.708
Nah,
it'’ll take too long.Get ready.

43:00.882 --> 43:03.145
The horses aren'’t going to
like crossing this ice.

43:11.023 --> 43:13.199
Where do you think
you'’re going, huh?

43:14.417 --> 43:16.419
Ah! Oh, God.

43:16.594 --> 43:18.900
Oh, for fuck'’s sake.Where do you think
you'’re running?

43:19.074 --> 43:21.990
Can no one bring
this puckish bitch to heel?

43:32.914 --> 43:37.310
Damn it! I'’ve had enough
of your girlish fuckery
for one day!

43:37.484 --> 43:40.574
Now stand down,
or I don'’t know
what I'’m liable to do!

43:46.841 --> 43:47.799
Oh.

44:01.029 --> 44:01.943
Hey, grab up the rope!

44:02.117 --> 44:03.031
No!

44:08.297 --> 44:09.864
Grab the rope!

44:10.691 --> 44:12.562
Get the rope!
Grab it!

44:13.346 --> 44:14.956
Where is she?

44:15.130 --> 44:16.697
This is a river.

44:16.871 --> 44:18.699
Current'’s taking her
anywhere downstream.

44:18.873 --> 44:20.483
I think downstream
is that way.

44:20.658 --> 44:23.182
I don'’t care
if you bring her back
as a corpse.

44:23.356 --> 44:26.359
That little bitch
better be strapped
to the ass of your horse

44:26.533 --> 44:27.926
by the time the storm
blows over,

44:28.100 --> 44:29.362
or the last camp
I left you at

44:29.536 --> 44:31.756
will seem like a matinee
at the panto!

44:33.279 --> 44:34.933
Huh?

44:47.249 --> 44:48.816
My daddy got this
in the army.

44:48.990 --> 44:50.992
I got it when he died.

44:51.166 --> 44:52.385
Felix, no. I--

44:52.559 --> 44:54.735
You can give it back
when you'’re done.

44:56.389 --> 44:58.043
You'’ll be all right.

44:58.217 --> 45:01.481
Come on, Romeo.
Get on your horse.

45:01.655 --> 45:02.961
You read Shakespeare?

45:05.572 --> 45:07.356
What the fuck
is Shakespeare?

45:07.530 --> 45:08.575
Let'’s go.

45:48.441 --> 45:49.834
Oh, yeah.

45:55.927 --> 45:56.928
There we go.

45:58.843 --> 46:00.888
Juniper Christmas!

46:01.062 --> 46:04.152
Don'’t move! Don'’t move!
Your sleeve will freeze
to the ice.

46:23.215 --> 46:27.175
Got a fire right yonder.
We can get you warmed up.

46:27.349 --> 46:29.351
We need to go now.

46:29.525 --> 46:32.137
Soon as we get you
warm enough.Now, please!

46:32.964 --> 46:34.052
Who you running from?

46:35.401 --> 46:37.969
Devils.

46:38.752 --> 46:40.406
Come on now.

47:15.136 --> 47:16.311
What happened?

47:16.485 --> 47:18.313
Fell through some thin ice,
I reckon.

47:18.487 --> 47:21.186
Just stable Orion.
I'’ll draw a bath
for this one.

47:25.755 --> 47:28.758
Get you warmed up
in no time.

47:31.849 --> 47:33.024
What'’s your name?

47:33.981 --> 47:35.330
Abigale.

47:37.115 --> 47:38.203
Nora.

47:38.377 --> 47:40.509
My husband is Erik.

47:41.815 --> 47:44.862
Do you have any family
we could...

47:46.689 --> 47:48.169
They'’re all dead.

47:50.302 --> 47:51.912
Oh.

47:52.086 --> 47:54.654
You could stay with us
as long as you need.

48:32.344 --> 48:35.086
She was terrified.
That'’s for sure.

48:35.260 --> 48:36.826
Well, where she come from?

48:37.001 --> 48:38.524
Can'’t have been far.

48:38.698 --> 48:41.527
But I didn'’t see no smoke,
so it'’s hard to say.

48:42.615 --> 48:44.051
She say how they died?

48:44.225 --> 48:45.357
No.

48:45.531 --> 48:47.620
What do we do with her?

48:47.794 --> 48:49.448
Take her in.

48:49.622 --> 48:51.667
The Lord sent you
to be her savior.

48:52.842 --> 48:54.888
What if the devil sent her
to be our demise?

48:55.062 --> 48:56.629
Don'’t be an old fool.

48:56.803 --> 48:59.153
You didn'’t see the look
in her eyes, Nora.

49:00.546 --> 49:03.549
What about that blood
you washed from her hair?

49:03.723 --> 49:05.333
The current washed
most of it away.

49:05.507 --> 49:06.856
You find a wound?

49:08.336 --> 49:13.428
Just a few lumps
and bruises.

49:29.314 --> 49:34.014
She can stay with us
for a time, but I'’d feel
better about the situation

49:34.188 --> 49:36.190
if we found someone
who knows her family.

49:37.017 --> 49:38.801
You'’re right.Yeah, well,

49:38.976 --> 49:40.673
I don'’t wanna be.

49:49.421 --> 49:52.119
Would you like
to stay in longer?

49:52.293 --> 49:55.731
I could boil
some more water.

49:56.994 --> 49:59.344
I don'’t want
to be a burden.

49:59.518 --> 50:03.391
I wouldn'’t have offered
if it was any inconvenience.

50:07.787 --> 50:08.831
You'’re with child?

50:09.006 --> 50:10.616
Maybe a little.

50:11.486 --> 50:14.185
I don'’t--Well, Erik and I

50:14.359 --> 50:19.146
are happy to have you here
safe with us.

51:42.055 --> 51:44.144
Mmm.

51:48.627 --> 51:52.196
She been gone too long.
She ain'’t coming back.

51:53.458 --> 51:54.763
You don'’t know that.

51:57.288 --> 52:01.988
That was pretty of you
to sacrifice your gun.

52:03.032 --> 52:04.425
Least now,
it might get some use.

52:04.599 --> 52:06.210
Oh, it'’s been fired plenty.

52:06.384 --> 52:08.386
By who? Your daddy?

52:08.560 --> 52:10.823
To hell with you.
You even have a daddy?

52:11.780 --> 52:12.825
No.

52:15.523 --> 52:17.873
You might as well
have thrown it in the river.

52:19.223 --> 52:20.702
You ain'’t ever
gonna see it again.

52:21.747 --> 52:23.488
Mmm.

52:23.662 --> 52:25.794
Logan should'’ve slit her throat
last time she tried to run.

52:27.840 --> 52:30.799
Or did you forget
that part already?

52:42.985 --> 52:46.119
Even a shitty gun like yours
deserves to ride with someone
who'’d use it.

53:05.312 --> 53:06.313
Mmm.

53:07.401 --> 53:09.142
Them sure is good.

53:15.322 --> 53:16.323
Pardon.

53:20.545 --> 53:21.546
Good boy.

56:11.368 --> 56:13.195
You remember me,
right?

56:48.317 --> 56:50.450
Son of a bumble bee.

56:50.624 --> 56:51.843
Nora!

56:56.935 --> 56:58.893
I done told you, Nora!

57:09.513 --> 57:11.384
...brought that girl home.Is she gone?

57:11.558 --> 57:13.560
Didn'’t I say there was
something off about that girl?

57:13.734 --> 57:16.476
But she can'’t have gone far,
not in her condition.She'’s taken Orion.

57:16.650 --> 57:17.956
You are not
going after her.

57:18.130 --> 57:20.611
We need that horse,
Nora.No, I need you.

57:20.785 --> 57:24.789
This. All of this,
this is our miracle.

57:24.963 --> 57:27.792
We'’ve worked too hard not
to see it through together.

57:27.966 --> 57:30.403
Well, I wouldn'’t exactly
call it "work," now.

57:33.101 --> 57:34.973
You know what I mean.

57:35.626 --> 57:37.454
Come here.

57:37.628 --> 57:40.369
If I don'’t find them
in a few hours,
I'’ll turn back.

57:41.675 --> 57:43.721
Promise me.I promise.

57:46.288 --> 57:49.248
You do what needs to be done,
but don'’t you dare
leave us alone.

57:51.468 --> 57:52.991
Sure enough.

58:59.013 --> 59:00.711
I was hoping
you'’d return.

59:02.539 --> 59:05.237
Hey,
I'’m not gonna hurt you.

59:06.151 --> 59:07.500
Look at me.

59:07.674 --> 59:09.197
Couldn'’t hurt you
if I wanted to.

59:13.027 --> 59:15.203
Where is my family?

59:15.377 --> 59:16.727
What have you done
with them?

59:30.392 --> 59:31.959
I was afraid
you were dead.

59:35.702 --> 59:36.703
Come--

59:37.878 --> 59:39.488
Come warm yourself
by the fire.

59:41.708 --> 59:42.709
Please?

01:00:06.341 --> 01:00:07.952
Why are you doing
all this?

01:00:10.084 --> 01:00:11.216
Why are you here?

01:00:16.438 --> 01:00:18.571
They sent me out
to find you.

01:00:18.745 --> 01:00:20.268
Bring you back.

01:00:21.530 --> 01:00:23.402
But I ain'’t gonna do that.

01:00:25.099 --> 01:00:26.405
I'’m never going back.

01:00:30.670 --> 01:00:31.671
And...

01:00:34.848 --> 01:00:37.416
I don'’t know why I done
what I done.

01:00:40.114 --> 01:00:43.291
I-- I tried to run away,

01:00:43.465 --> 01:00:46.904
but then they--
they done this
to my hands, and...

01:00:50.429 --> 01:00:52.605
I didn'’t know what else
to do then.

01:00:53.780 --> 01:00:55.695
But that don'’t matter,
'’cause...

01:00:58.611 --> 01:01:00.613
I'’m the cause
of your suffering.

01:01:05.836 --> 01:01:08.142
Too much suffering.

01:01:12.799 --> 01:01:14.496
I ain'’t gonna
cause no more.

01:01:27.379 --> 01:01:29.686
You'’ll ruin your hands
if you don'’t let them heal.

01:01:34.038 --> 01:01:35.561
They'’re already ruined.

01:01:57.670 --> 01:02:00.281
Where'’d you find
that horse?

01:02:00.455 --> 01:02:02.719
A rancher pulled me
from the water.

01:02:04.895 --> 01:02:07.245
So, you stole it?Borrowed it.

01:02:10.030 --> 01:02:13.730
I have every intention
of returning him
once I get Fable back.

01:02:16.645 --> 01:02:17.864
Tell me you'’re jokin'’.

01:02:19.736 --> 01:02:22.260
You'’re going back
to them fiends
for a horse?

01:02:24.001 --> 01:02:26.264
He'’s the only family
I got left.

01:02:28.222 --> 01:02:29.615
That'’s suicide.

01:02:31.443 --> 01:02:34.228
Either way,
I'’ll end up
with my family.

01:02:43.760 --> 01:02:47.024
We can return after the thaw,
if you'’d like.

01:02:47.198 --> 01:02:48.634
Bury '’em proper.

01:02:52.594 --> 01:02:53.857
You'’d do that?

01:02:56.163 --> 01:02:57.774
If you'’d let me.

01:03:16.662 --> 01:03:17.837
Fucking bitch!

01:03:18.011 --> 01:03:20.884
Stole the arrowheads.
I know it.

01:03:21.972 --> 01:03:23.974
What are you
talking about?

01:03:24.148 --> 01:03:26.977
I made a cache of them
before we left.Well, now they'’re gone.

01:03:27.151 --> 01:03:29.022
Why would she steal
a bunch of scrap arrowheads?

01:03:29.196 --> 01:03:31.808
Cause it'’s the best proof
she'’s got!

01:03:31.982 --> 01:03:35.594
They could lead the law
right to us,
if she'’s turned on us.

01:03:35.768 --> 01:03:39.772
Felix, saddle up,
find Cass
and bring her back!

01:03:39.946 --> 01:03:41.208
I'’m doing it.

01:03:41.382 --> 01:03:42.775
I'’ll do it.

01:03:42.949 --> 01:03:45.125
Sit the fuck down, junior.
This is man'’s work.

01:03:46.823 --> 01:03:48.520
Hey,
you bring her back alive.

01:03:49.651 --> 01:03:52.785
If you harm her,
I'’ll know about it.

01:03:52.959 --> 01:03:55.266
I won'’t harm her any worse
than you already have.

01:03:56.876 --> 01:03:59.661
They'’re my arrowheads.
I'’m doing it.

01:03:59.836 --> 01:04:04.014
Okay. If you don'’t,
it'’s your neck!

01:04:05.015 --> 01:04:08.105
Rhys,
don'’t make it mine!

01:06:00.608 --> 01:06:01.827
Good evening.

01:06:03.524 --> 01:06:05.396
Can I get me some
of that?

01:06:05.570 --> 01:06:07.746
I'’ll pay if you want.

01:06:07.920 --> 01:06:08.965
Oh.

01:06:16.537 --> 01:06:17.669
No trouble.

01:06:17.843 --> 01:06:19.671
Obliged to you.

01:06:21.455 --> 01:06:24.545
You walked all the way
from Wicker?
In the dark?

01:06:26.721 --> 01:06:28.288
I should'’ve charged you
for the coffee.

01:06:29.463 --> 01:06:30.508
Mmm.

01:06:33.772 --> 01:06:35.252
What you know
about these?

01:06:38.603 --> 01:06:40.431
Not worth the price
of the coffee.

01:06:40.605 --> 01:06:43.347
Not looking to sell them.
Asking what you know.

01:06:43.521 --> 01:06:47.264
Okay. Well, that'’s--
that'’s handmade, so--

01:06:47.438 --> 01:06:51.833
I only do
first-quality stuff here,
so thank you, but no, thank you.

01:06:52.008 --> 01:06:53.096
That'’s not what I asked.

01:06:53.270 --> 01:06:55.228
I don'’t know anything
about them.

01:06:56.403 --> 01:06:58.014
And neither do you.

01:06:58.188 --> 01:07:00.103
Go home, friend.

01:07:17.642 --> 01:07:19.122
Can I have a look
at '’em?

01:07:21.124 --> 01:07:24.127
You know what?
I-It'’s getting late.
I think I'’ll--

01:07:29.523 --> 01:07:32.352
You got a name?To hell with you!

01:07:32.526 --> 01:07:34.267
Okay.

01:07:39.272 --> 01:07:40.491
You ain'’t got a gun?

01:07:40.665 --> 01:07:43.233
No.

01:07:43.407 --> 01:07:45.931
Hey, you stay right there,
friend.

01:07:46.932 --> 01:07:48.847
Hey there.

01:07:54.809 --> 01:07:56.942
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

01:07:58.335 --> 01:08:00.424
Sorry.
I'’m sorry. I'’m sorry.

01:08:00.598 --> 01:08:03.949
This man I just nailed
to the bar, who is he?

01:08:04.123 --> 01:08:05.733
I'’ve never seen him before
in my life.

01:08:09.824 --> 01:08:12.044
He owns
the Wicker Creek Ranch!

01:08:12.218 --> 01:08:13.611
I want a name, old man.

01:08:13.785 --> 01:08:15.700
Sir, I do not know.You ain'’t gotta do that.

01:08:15.874 --> 01:08:18.137
Erik! Erik!
His name is Erik!

01:08:18.311 --> 01:08:19.443
That'’s enough, now.

01:08:22.054 --> 01:08:23.969
He has a pregnant wife!
He has a pregnant wife!

01:08:24.143 --> 01:08:25.275
Thank you.

01:08:25.449 --> 01:08:29.888
Now, Mr. Erik
with the pregnant wife

01:08:30.062 --> 01:08:32.891
from Wicker Creek Ranch,

01:08:33.065 --> 01:08:34.632
where'’d you get
them arrowheads?

01:08:36.938 --> 01:08:39.071
Where'’d you find them?

01:08:39.245 --> 01:08:40.420
No, no.

01:08:40.594 --> 01:08:43.031
I-- I found them
in some trees.

01:08:43.206 --> 01:08:44.598
They led me here.

01:08:44.772 --> 01:08:45.817
What are you lookin'’ for?

01:08:47.210 --> 01:08:50.343
Could you--
Could you not
hurt him no more. Please?

01:08:50.517 --> 01:08:54.042
Tell me
what I want to know,
and I'’ll consider it.

01:08:55.827 --> 01:08:58.090
M-My horse.
She stole my horse.

01:08:58.264 --> 01:08:59.874
Who?

01:09:00.048 --> 01:09:02.094
I don'’t know!
She ain'’t never
told me her name.

01:09:10.581 --> 01:09:13.801
No! No! No!

01:09:24.638 --> 01:09:26.379
No!
Good Lord have mercy!

01:09:26.553 --> 01:09:28.120
Oh!

01:09:43.004 --> 01:09:45.355
Mr. Erik?
Mr. Erik?

01:09:46.486 --> 01:09:48.662
Looks like you and me'’s
partners now.

01:09:49.968 --> 01:09:51.317
Let'’s go find your horse.

01:10:07.551 --> 01:10:09.422
Why don'’t you carry a gun,
rancher?

01:10:10.467 --> 01:10:11.729
You lose it?

01:10:13.600 --> 01:10:17.822
In the war, I done pointed
too many a gun
at too many men,

01:10:17.996 --> 01:10:19.040
and, um...

01:10:21.391 --> 01:10:23.915
just won'’t do it
no more.

01:10:25.873 --> 01:10:27.701
Well,
that'’s a pretty notion.

01:10:29.050 --> 01:10:30.922
Pretty fuckin'’ stupid.

01:10:33.141 --> 01:10:34.491
You see any more?

01:10:59.342 --> 01:11:01.866
Cassidy,
good to see you again.

01:11:03.694 --> 01:11:04.956
But...

01:11:06.174 --> 01:11:09.003
you ain'’t got the strength
to pull that trigger.

01:11:10.744 --> 01:11:11.832
Do you?

01:11:14.705 --> 01:11:16.837
Go on, rancher.
Fetch.

01:12:01.578 --> 01:12:02.796
Mm-hmm.

01:12:06.887 --> 01:12:09.281
Never cared
for the Schofield
much myself.

01:12:10.195 --> 01:12:12.893
Too much maintenance.
Mmm.

01:12:15.679 --> 01:12:18.464
Where'’s the girl?

01:12:19.683 --> 01:12:21.162
She never came out
of the water.

01:12:21.337 --> 01:12:22.773
Don'’t lie to me.

01:12:22.947 --> 01:12:24.209
I'’m not.

01:12:24.383 --> 01:12:25.471
Why did you come back here?

01:12:25.645 --> 01:12:27.604
Give these folks
a proper burial.

01:12:27.778 --> 01:12:29.606
More than you'’ve ever
done for anyone.

01:12:29.780 --> 01:12:32.783
They get where they'’re going
one way or another.

01:12:34.872 --> 01:12:38.832
Come on.
Get on your horse.
Let'’s go.

01:12:39.920 --> 01:12:41.400
What?

01:12:41.574 --> 01:12:43.402
You went through the trouble
of stealin'’ it.

01:12:43.576 --> 01:12:45.273
We ain'’t just
leavin'’ it behind.

01:12:45.448 --> 01:12:48.320
Don'’t give me
no trouble now.

01:12:48.494 --> 01:12:50.061
Ain'’t them hands
had enough?

01:12:50.235 --> 01:12:52.455
I was coming back anyhow.

01:12:52.629 --> 01:12:56.937
I left them arrowheads
so I could find my way back.
Ain'’t no Natty Bumppo.

01:13:15.478 --> 01:13:18.219
Erik! Erik! Erik!

01:13:20.787 --> 01:13:24.356
Oh, God. Come on.

01:13:27.272 --> 01:13:29.405
Oh!
Oh, thank God.

01:13:29.579 --> 01:13:31.537
Yeah, praise him.

01:13:31.711 --> 01:13:33.800
Maybe not just yet,
though.

01:13:34.540 --> 01:13:35.541
I'’m so sorry.

01:13:39.719 --> 01:13:41.721
Oh. Yeah.

01:13:41.895 --> 01:13:46.117
My wife said it'’d make me
look more intimidating
to a predator.

01:13:46.291 --> 01:13:47.684
She'’s a smart woman.

01:13:47.858 --> 01:13:49.207
Sure enough.

01:13:53.341 --> 01:13:56.562
What did he do
to your hand?Nothing nice.

01:13:56.736 --> 01:13:58.999
Fella got some sort
of trademark.

01:14:09.227 --> 01:14:11.011
This will apply
enough pressure
to the wound

01:14:11.185 --> 01:14:13.013
without cutting off
circulation.

01:14:13.187 --> 01:14:15.407
How-- How do you know
how to do that?

01:14:16.756 --> 01:14:18.192
My father taught me.

01:14:19.324 --> 01:14:21.631
Well,
he taught my brother,
but I watched.

01:14:26.723 --> 01:14:28.986
You know, you'’re lucky
you ain'’t caught pneumonia yet.

01:14:29.160 --> 01:14:30.553
You can thank Nora
for that.

01:14:30.727 --> 01:14:32.816
You can thank her yourself.

01:14:35.993 --> 01:14:38.212
I should'’ve never
stolen your horse.

01:14:38.386 --> 01:14:39.692
Why did you?

01:14:58.755 --> 01:15:00.060
He do this?

01:15:00.234 --> 01:15:02.802
He was one of them.How many are there?

01:15:03.847 --> 01:15:06.066
Four to begin with.
One'’s already dead.

01:15:06.240 --> 01:15:07.807
So, what you
gonna do now?

01:15:10.549 --> 01:15:12.116
Get our horses back.

01:15:15.075 --> 01:15:16.686
I can follow their tracks.

01:15:17.861 --> 01:15:20.211
We should move out
before sundown.

01:15:21.342 --> 01:15:22.866
You'’re not going
with me.

01:15:23.736 --> 01:15:25.825
Look here.

01:15:25.999 --> 01:15:30.177
From this point on,
I'’m choosing to accompany you
and get our horses back.

01:15:30.351 --> 01:15:33.572
After that,
you can make your mind up

01:15:33.746 --> 01:15:37.707
as to whether or not
you want to come back
to the ranch with me.

01:16:02.688 --> 01:16:05.473
Hey, easy, easy.
Easy, easy.

01:16:33.893 --> 01:16:35.591
You ain'’t gonna run away
no more.

01:16:41.031 --> 01:16:42.815
Ain'’t gonna walk
nowhere neither.

01:16:45.644 --> 01:16:47.646
Leave her.

01:16:47.820 --> 01:16:49.213
But she'’ll freeze.

01:16:49.387 --> 01:16:51.258
I'’m not asking.

01:16:52.825 --> 01:16:55.088
Go take care
of the horses.

01:17:23.726 --> 01:17:26.076
You'’re gonna bleed out
if that isn'’t
treated properly.

01:17:26.250 --> 01:17:27.164
Yeah,
I'’ll be all right.

01:17:27.338 --> 01:17:28.644
Bullshit.That language--

01:17:28.818 --> 01:17:30.123
You'’d rather die
of blood loss

01:17:30.297 --> 01:17:32.473
than see your life out
with Nora and your child?

01:17:32.648 --> 01:17:35.215
I can'’t let you
go in there alone.

01:17:35.389 --> 01:17:37.522
I'’m not some
helpless little girl
who can'’t fend for herself.

01:17:37.696 --> 01:17:39.567
Oh, come on.
You know that'’s not
what I meant.

01:17:39.742 --> 01:17:41.221
What did you mean?

01:17:43.746 --> 01:17:45.138
We'’re walking
into a snake pit,

01:17:45.312 --> 01:17:47.445
but I intend
to retrieve what'’s ours.

01:17:47.619 --> 01:17:48.707
So,
what we gonna do then?

01:17:48.881 --> 01:17:51.144
Just wait outside
until one of them

01:17:51.318 --> 01:17:53.277
decides to take the horses
for a stroll?

01:17:54.713 --> 01:17:56.280
For now,
we'’re gonna rest.

01:17:57.803 --> 01:17:59.413
Just for a minute.

01:18:10.163 --> 01:18:12.557
Yeah.

01:18:40.933 --> 01:18:44.589
She may not be able to run,
but she'’s still a traitor.

01:18:46.199 --> 01:18:50.290
Oh, she just needs
a little correction
every now and again,

01:18:50.464 --> 01:18:52.553
which I'’m happy to supply.

01:18:52.728 --> 01:18:54.381
That'’s not tough enough.

01:18:57.863 --> 01:18:59.386
She'’ll run on us again.

01:19:00.866 --> 01:19:02.563
What do you want me
to do?

01:19:04.478 --> 01:19:07.264
Cut the bitch'’s head off
and use it as a knocker
at the gate?

01:19:07.438 --> 01:19:09.745
If you can'’t control
your own woman,

01:19:09.919 --> 01:19:12.617
then she'’ll get us
all killed.

01:19:15.794 --> 01:19:18.144
Makes me wonder

01:19:18.318 --> 01:19:20.625
who'’s the real bitch here.

01:19:27.763 --> 01:19:31.462
She'’s not the one
pushing boundaries now, is she?

01:19:56.661 --> 01:19:59.142
I'’ve always wondered
how these things work.

01:20:27.126 --> 01:20:28.475
You still alive, old man?

01:20:28.649 --> 01:20:30.303
Fuck you!

01:20:31.957 --> 01:20:33.350
No, thanks.

01:20:33.524 --> 01:20:35.526
You ain'’t got the equipment
for it no more.

01:20:51.498 --> 01:20:52.499
Hey!

01:20:52.673 --> 01:20:54.762
Hey, what the hell
are you doing?

01:20:59.202 --> 01:21:00.681
I'’m doing
what need be done.

01:21:00.856 --> 01:21:04.990
Now,
you either stand with me,

01:21:05.164 --> 01:21:07.514
or you lie bloody
with him.

01:21:08.254 --> 01:21:09.690
Make your choice.

01:21:11.649 --> 01:21:13.390
Good boy.

01:21:17.046 --> 01:21:18.699
And you, old friend...

01:21:20.353 --> 01:21:22.225
...you already made
your choice.

01:21:22.965 --> 01:21:24.488
Die with it.

01:21:35.891 --> 01:21:38.850
Come here, girl.

01:21:39.024 --> 01:21:40.765
You see me?

01:21:40.939 --> 01:21:42.201
Can you see me?

01:21:44.595 --> 01:21:46.727
You may still have a chance,

01:21:46.902 --> 01:21:50.209
if you survive the night
with me

01:21:50.383 --> 01:21:52.690
and by my good graces.

01:21:54.344 --> 01:21:59.131
If you choose to betray me
like you did him, well...

01:22:01.873 --> 01:22:02.918
Do you see him?

01:22:03.092 --> 01:22:05.224
Do you see him?

01:22:07.096 --> 01:22:08.097
Good.

01:22:15.104 --> 01:22:16.540
When he dies,

01:22:17.889 --> 01:22:19.935
you drag him out back
with the rest of the waste.

01:22:25.592 --> 01:22:26.985
Now'’s fine.

01:22:49.790 --> 01:22:53.664
Oh, no.

01:22:53.838 --> 01:22:56.232
Goddamn!
That'’s nasty!

01:23:31.658 --> 01:23:34.705
Cass? Cass?

01:23:36.402 --> 01:23:38.013
Here, drink this.

01:23:38.752 --> 01:23:39.927
Careful. It'’s hot.

01:23:42.495 --> 01:23:44.758
I'’ll bring more
when I can.

01:23:44.932 --> 01:23:47.892
Help me.
Help me.

01:23:51.896 --> 01:23:53.724
Wait.It'’s almost morning.

01:23:58.598 --> 01:23:59.904
Felix!

01:24:00.861 --> 01:24:02.167
Felix!

01:24:03.603 --> 01:24:04.952
Felix!

01:24:06.954 --> 01:24:08.217
Help me!

01:24:09.087 --> 01:24:11.437
Help me!

01:24:12.873 --> 01:24:14.179
Quiet!

01:24:15.615 --> 01:24:16.616
You okay?

01:24:21.752 --> 01:24:24.581
Sounds close.
Any idea
where we are?

01:24:25.625 --> 01:24:26.670
No.

01:24:28.193 --> 01:24:31.196
We should wait until dawn
so we can see
where we'’re going.

01:24:31.370 --> 01:24:33.938
Who says she survives
that long?

01:25:19.331 --> 01:25:21.725
Why won'’t you
just kill me?

01:25:27.165 --> 01:25:29.515
Well, you dead
ain'’t what I want.

01:25:32.214 --> 01:25:34.129
I don'’t belong
to no man.

01:25:37.828 --> 01:25:40.135
You keep
telling yourself that.

01:25:41.527 --> 01:25:42.702
Maybe it'’ll come true.

01:26:00.633 --> 01:26:02.026
Fiery.

01:26:20.175 --> 01:26:21.263
There'’s a guard.

01:26:21.437 --> 01:26:23.134
He won'’t even know
I'’m there.

01:26:23.308 --> 01:26:26.093
Are you crazy?
We don'’t even know
how many are in there.

01:26:27.443 --> 01:26:29.967
I'’ll slip in,
get our horses,
and slip out.

01:26:30.141 --> 01:26:31.969
Then you can go.I'’m not leaving
without you.

01:26:32.143 --> 01:26:34.667
It don'’t make sense
for us to both go in there.

01:26:40.369 --> 01:26:42.762
I could use some help
with that wall,
though.

01:26:57.908 --> 01:26:59.649
Now, please.

01:28:27.867 --> 01:28:30.522
What are you doing?
What are you doing here?

01:28:30.696 --> 01:28:32.176
What'’s it look like?

01:28:56.592 --> 01:28:58.158
Take it.

01:28:58.333 --> 01:29:00.117
We don'’t have long.

01:29:17.526 --> 01:29:19.354
Go get the horses.
I'’ll meet you at the gate.

01:29:19.528 --> 01:29:21.573
Go. Go.

01:29:21.747 --> 01:29:22.748
Thank you.

01:29:37.676 --> 01:29:40.549
Come here.
Okay. It'’s okay.

01:29:40.723 --> 01:29:42.072
Are you ready to go?

01:29:43.378 --> 01:29:44.901
I'’ll be back for you.

01:29:49.688 --> 01:29:51.864
It'’s okay.
It'’s okay.

01:29:53.910 --> 01:29:55.390
Almost there.

01:30:01.352 --> 01:30:05.051
How did Romeo and Juliet
end again?

01:30:06.009 --> 01:30:07.445
I forget.

01:30:21.067 --> 01:30:23.679
You'’re gonna be fine.
You'’re gonna make it.

01:30:30.381 --> 01:30:33.428
Take her, and keep her close.
She won'’t survive
in the cold.

01:30:39.434 --> 01:30:41.740
Take care of her
for me.Sure enough.

01:30:48.094 --> 01:30:50.793
Take this.
It'’s all I got left.

01:30:50.967 --> 01:30:52.229
Orion'’s still in there.

01:30:52.403 --> 01:30:54.492
Hold on.

01:30:57.669 --> 01:31:00.237
Run. Now.
Forget the horse.No. Orion!

01:31:00.411 --> 01:31:03.153
We got to get to move on.
Now or never.

01:31:26.829 --> 01:31:28.570
Finally grew a pair,
huh?

01:31:29.919 --> 01:31:31.529
Good boy.

01:31:51.680 --> 01:31:54.726
Jammed.

01:31:56.641 --> 01:32:00.079
It'’s pretty,
but useless.

01:32:01.516 --> 01:32:04.170
Like you
and that whore.

01:32:08.697 --> 01:32:09.698
Hey.

01:32:11.395 --> 01:32:13.702
You know
how your daddy died?

01:32:14.920 --> 01:32:16.531
You know?

01:32:16.705 --> 01:32:18.054
In--

01:32:18.924 --> 01:32:20.143
In the revolution.

01:32:20.317 --> 01:32:21.797
Oh.

01:32:22.537 --> 01:32:24.190
Suffering for his people?

01:32:25.104 --> 01:32:26.976
My daddy died a hero.

01:32:28.281 --> 01:32:29.761
Suffering ain'’t noble.

01:32:30.457 --> 01:32:31.850
It'’s just suffering.

01:34:11.167 --> 01:34:12.516
There you go.

01:34:13.996 --> 01:34:15.301
Good girl.

01:34:16.868 --> 01:34:19.262
All right. Hey.

01:34:21.656 --> 01:34:22.657
All right.

01:34:39.325 --> 01:34:40.370
Hey.

01:34:41.632 --> 01:34:42.677
Abigale.

01:34:44.940 --> 01:34:46.768
I know.You know nothin'’.

01:34:49.248 --> 01:34:50.815
Don'’t you do that
to yourself.

01:34:50.989 --> 01:34:52.991
Nothing good
can come from it.

01:34:55.864 --> 01:34:57.213
I miss them.

01:35:07.702 --> 01:35:08.877
What were their names?

01:35:13.142 --> 01:35:17.886
Abraham, Celeste,
and Tobias, my brother.

01:35:20.976 --> 01:35:23.195
They were all I had,
and I failed them.

01:35:23.369 --> 01:35:26.982
No. No, I don'’t--
I don'’t see it that way.

01:35:27.809 --> 01:35:29.158
Everything I know,

01:35:29.332 --> 01:35:30.942
I learned
from watching my parents,

01:35:31.116 --> 01:35:34.250
but I never got the chance
to do anything for myself.

01:35:39.864 --> 01:35:41.213
I didn'’t mean...

01:35:43.215 --> 01:35:44.216
I understand.

01:35:46.915 --> 01:35:47.872
You know, I was...

01:35:49.744 --> 01:35:55.358
brought up to keep quiet,
stay in my place
and not make a fuss,

01:35:55.532 --> 01:35:57.839
and that'’s exactly
what I did.

01:36:00.711 --> 01:36:03.235
I let them die.

01:36:03.409 --> 01:36:05.194
It'’s my fault,
and there ain'’t...

01:36:06.412 --> 01:36:09.241
nothing I can do
to bring them back.

01:36:09.415 --> 01:36:12.505
And there ain'’t nothing
I can do to make it up.
I can'’t be saved.

01:36:12.679 --> 01:36:14.769
Don'’t you start thinking
that way now.

01:36:17.336 --> 01:36:20.557
It wasn'’t you
who brought this hell
down upon your family.

01:36:36.660 --> 01:36:38.749
I don'’t think
she did either.

01:36:40.098 --> 01:36:42.884
She was a prisoner,
just like I was
intended to be.

01:36:45.147 --> 01:36:48.541
She saved my life twice.

01:36:48.715 --> 01:36:53.285
She could'’ve let them
turn me into whatever it was
that they made her be.

01:36:53.459 --> 01:36:55.418
But she'’s got a good heart,
deep down.

01:36:56.636 --> 01:36:58.421
I'’m not gonna
let her die here.

01:37:01.076 --> 01:37:04.775
I'’m sorry about Orion.

01:37:06.690 --> 01:37:10.825
Well, I'’m just glad
the both of y'’all safe.

01:37:15.699 --> 01:37:19.137
I'’ll feel better about that
once we'’re away
from this place.

01:38:06.881 --> 01:38:09.753
There, there, there.

01:38:24.072 --> 01:38:26.422
How far
to the homestead?

01:38:26.596 --> 01:38:29.991
Not far
if you'’re on a horse,
but walking...

01:38:32.167 --> 01:38:33.733
Should we rest
for a bit?

01:38:33.908 --> 01:38:35.648
I'’ll let you know.

01:39:39.886 --> 01:39:40.975
You'’re home.

01:39:41.149 --> 01:39:42.628
We'’re home.

01:39:44.979 --> 01:39:46.632
Can you get her inside?

01:39:48.330 --> 01:39:49.548
Think I'’ll manage.

01:40:02.083 --> 01:40:03.562
Hey, boy.

01:40:05.347 --> 01:40:07.175
What you doing?

01:40:34.854 --> 01:40:37.031
Ah.

01:40:38.119 --> 01:40:39.903
Man of the house

01:40:40.077 --> 01:40:42.993
makes his triumphant return
from the dead.

01:40:44.168 --> 01:40:46.431
Nora, come here, love.

01:40:46.605 --> 01:40:48.825
No. No. No.

01:40:49.782 --> 01:40:52.611
She'’s happy here
with me.

01:40:54.570 --> 01:40:55.614
What you want?

01:40:57.138 --> 01:40:59.749
I want-- I want
what every man wants.

01:41:01.185 --> 01:41:03.100
A nice home, and...

01:41:07.017 --> 01:41:08.192
a loving family.

01:41:08.366 --> 01:41:09.802
Well, you ain'’t gonna
find it here.

01:41:09.976 --> 01:41:13.589
Oh,
I think I'’m gonna
like it here.

01:41:13.763 --> 01:41:16.026
My last family,

01:41:16.200 --> 01:41:17.897
it didn'’t work out
too good.

01:41:19.856 --> 01:41:21.118
Disobedient.

01:41:22.859 --> 01:41:25.731
These ladies shouldn'’t be
too hard to train.

01:41:25.905 --> 01:41:28.343
Nora, you all right?She'’s fine.

01:41:28.517 --> 01:41:30.910
Women in this house
can speak for themselves.

01:41:31.955 --> 01:41:33.565
But...

01:41:35.611 --> 01:41:37.308
...it ain'’t your house
no more.

01:41:37.482 --> 01:41:39.745
Well, it sure as hell
ain'’t yours!

01:41:44.968 --> 01:41:48.014
Let her go.
Please.

01:41:51.105 --> 01:41:52.541
And what if I don'’t?

01:41:52.715 --> 01:41:53.933
Huh?

01:41:54.108 --> 01:41:57.720
Oh, are you--
you gonna draw on me, huh?

01:41:58.764 --> 01:42:00.070
I ain'’t no gunslinger.

01:42:00.897 --> 01:42:02.942
No, no.

01:42:03.769 --> 01:42:05.293
You'’re just a rancher.

01:42:05.467 --> 01:42:09.471
I could use someone
to keep this place up.

01:42:10.994 --> 01:42:13.214
You can sleep
in the stable.

01:42:16.347 --> 01:42:19.089
Take the house.
Let them leave.

01:42:22.136 --> 01:42:23.876
And why would I
do that?

01:42:24.050 --> 01:42:27.053
Take your fucking hands
off my wife!

01:42:35.497 --> 01:42:39.675
I don'’t think you understand
the predicament
that you'’re in, rancher.

01:42:39.849 --> 01:42:44.462
You see, I'’m going to do more
than just put my hands on her.

01:42:44.636 --> 01:42:45.942
She ain'’t yours no more.

01:42:59.173 --> 01:43:01.610
What happened to
your pretty notions, rancher?

01:43:01.784 --> 01:43:03.786
I thought you weren'’t
pointing guns no more.

01:43:05.440 --> 01:43:07.877
Forgot to say,
that one'’s jammed.

01:43:10.009 --> 01:43:14.275
I'’m afraid I ain'’t got much use
for a crippled ranch hand.

01:43:14.449 --> 01:43:15.798
No!

01:43:19.628 --> 01:43:21.630
She ain'’t gonna be your whore.
None of us is.

01:43:26.852 --> 01:43:29.507
Well, you ain'’t,
that'’s for damn sure.

01:43:29.681 --> 01:43:30.682
No!

01:43:54.445 --> 01:43:56.447
Goddamn it!

01:44:18.426 --> 01:44:21.167
This is my house!

01:44:21.342 --> 01:44:23.692
And you bitches
will do as I say.

01:44:23.866 --> 01:44:27.304
Get your fucking hands
off of her.

01:44:46.628 --> 01:44:49.152
You'’re about
to breathe your last.

01:44:49.326 --> 01:44:52.634
And ain'’t nobody
ever loved you.

01:44:57.595 --> 01:45:00.903
You feel that?

01:45:23.534 --> 01:45:24.840
Sweet Jesus.

01:45:25.014 --> 01:45:26.929
Erik?
Erik, can you hear me?

01:45:27.495 --> 01:45:28.757
Erik?

01:45:28.931 --> 01:45:30.149
Erik?

01:45:30.324 --> 01:45:33.239
Oh, thank God.
Oh, Abigale, he'’s alive.

01:46:43.962 --> 01:46:46.748
There there, Cassie.
