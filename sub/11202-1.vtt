updates about this concert.

01:29.417 --> 01:32.376
As you can see, the ambiance
is ready, the stage is set.

01:32.542 --> 01:34.167
And the fans have
been waiting for..

01:34.251 --> 01:35.959
...Rahul Jayekar for
the past two hours.

01:41.209 --> 01:43.209
Mr. Deepak. He won't make it.

01:43.417 --> 01:45.251
I am Aryan. I'm a singer too.

01:45.334 --> 01:47.667
Ohh! Get lost!
- Let me go on the stage.

01:47.876 --> 01:49.251
Sir. Listen to me.

01:49.334 --> 01:50.334
Sir, I've been struggling
for five years..

01:50.417 --> 01:51.292
...all thanks to people like these.

01:51.376 --> 01:52.709
Sir, I am ready.
Take me in, please.

01:54.001 --> 01:55.876
Struggle for 10 more years.

01:56.001 --> 01:57.292
Turn authentic.

01:57.376 --> 01:59.209
And if I'm still alive,
you can come meet me.

01:59.292 --> 02:00.751
Okay. Get lost now.

02:01.709 --> 02:03.001
Hello. Where's Vivek..

02:03.042 --> 02:05.251
Vivek! Vivek!

02:05.376 --> 02:07.251
Tell me honestly..

02:07.334 --> 02:09.292
...am I going to have a show or not?

02:10.001 --> 02:12.751
Please. Get this show
done for the last time.

02:13.001 --> 02:15.959
That announcer's
tired of announcing..

02:16.001 --> 02:17.292
...sir's arrival on stage.

02:17.459 --> 02:18.959
"He's coming now!"

02:19.042 --> 02:20.751
"He's on his way!"

02:21.084 --> 02:23.376
Please. Don't ruin my show.

02:28.459 --> 02:29.459
Rahul.

02:31.626 --> 02:32.917
Time to go on stage.

02:35.751 --> 02:37.334
What's the problem, Vivek?

02:37.709 --> 02:39.042
They paid me for this.

02:39.542 --> 02:40.876
I'm here to sing.

02:41.167 --> 02:43.167
And I won't leave without singing.

02:46.917 --> 02:49.709
In fact, those who expect nothing..

02:50.584 --> 02:52.709
...are the more responsible ones.

02:55.417 --> 02:56.417
Let's go.

02:58.167 --> 03:01.001
After countless album songs,
and live concerts..

03:03.584 --> 03:07.042
If anyone tries to create a scene,
just ignore him.

03:07.834 --> 03:09.126
If anything goes wrong..

03:09.292 --> 03:10.834
...the security here will handle it.

03:10.959 --> 03:11.959
Listen.

03:12.917 --> 03:14.501
Just control yourself.

03:16.834 --> 03:20.126
RJ! RJ! RJ!

03:20.209 --> 03:21.542
Ask the boys to be ready.

03:22.626 --> 03:25.126
We're going to give them a show.
- Your wait's over.

03:25.626 --> 03:28.626
And we're going to call on stage..

03:28.709 --> 03:31.251
...your favorite, RJ.

03:31.751 --> 03:35.709
That is, Rahul Jayekar.

04:05.126 --> 04:14.417
"Bless me with your grace."

04:51.126 --> 04:53.792
"Give me thoughts."

04:54.126 --> 04:56.626
"Give me oaths and promises."

04:57.001 --> 05:02.542
"Give directions to my prayers."

05:02.876 --> 05:05.417
"Give my heart refuge."

05:05.751 --> 05:08.334
"Give me new reasons."

05:08.751 --> 05:14.501
"Give my dreams wings to fly."

05:15.334 --> 05:20.542
"Bless me with your grace."

05:21.209 --> 05:25.751
"Take a look at me as well."

05:25.876 --> 05:30.667
"Are you listening?"

05:31.751 --> 05:37.042
III am crying-"

05:37.667 --> 05:42.292
"Are you listening?"

05:42.417 --> 05:47.417
"Why I am crying.".

05:52.459 --> 05:55.459
He's drunk! RJ!

06:28.001 --> 06:33.001
"Destiny's are lost."

06:34.084 --> 06:39.167
"The path's forlorn."

06:39.917 --> 06:45.084
"Come and take me away."

06:45.667 --> 06:50.626
"That's all I pray for."

06:51.167 --> 06:56.876
"it's your safekeeping."

06:57.084 --> 07:04.251
"You belong to me."

07:06.626 --> 07:12.042
"Bless me with your grace."

07:12.417 --> 07:17.001
"Take a look at me as well."

07:17.084 --> 07:21.792
"Are you listening?"

07:22.876 --> 07:28.167
III am crying-"

07:28.751 --> 07:34.751
"Are you listening?"

07:40.792 --> 07:41.834
RJ!

07:47.959 --> 07:49.001
Come, come.

07:59.042 --> 08:00.501
What are you waiting for?
Get the camera.

08:00.876 --> 08:01.959
Hurry UP-

08:02.042 --> 08:03.209
Take the shot!

08:07.251 --> 08:09.126
Get up. - Rahul, leave.

08:10.376 --> 08:13.001
You have ruined me.
I won't spare you, RJ.

08:13.042 --> 08:14.042
Rahul, let be.

08:14.126 --> 08:16.001
Get out.

08:17.042 --> 08:20.792
I don't want security.
I don't want it.

08:21.209 --> 08:22.667
Wait.

08:23.792 --> 08:27.167
Let's go - Yes sir.

08:28.084 --> 08:31.084
I know, these things
happen in cheap shows.

08:31.334 --> 08:32.167
Anyway-

08:32.251 --> 08:33.626
We'll discuss this
back at the hotel.

08:36.917 --> 08:39.083
I want to stay alone!

08:39.708 --> 08:41.042
Go somewhere far away.

08:41.126 --> 08:43.001
But, do you have a
problem if I come with you?

08:43.167 --> 08:44.501
No, there's no problem.

08:44.584 --> 08:47.334
I just want to go away
from this commotion. - What?

08:48.126 --> 08:50.084
There's not much
of commotion left now.

08:52.334 --> 08:53.542
It's almost over, Rahul.

08:54.959 --> 08:58.501
After doing shows at London,
New York, Australia..

08:59.167 --> 09:00.542
...now you don't have work.

09:02.167 --> 09:04.001
No one wants to work with you.

09:06.876 --> 09:09.667
Music directors. Film industry,
stage shows, pop albums.

09:09.751 --> 09:10.834
You've nothing.

09:12.501 --> 09:16.292
No one's going to support
a drunk artist for too long.

09:17.876 --> 09:19.459
No one's going to tolerate that.

09:20.126 --> 09:22.792
And now, it's come to this..

09:22.876 --> 09:24.792
...that we've to perform
in small cities.

09:25.542 --> 09:29.001
And pardon me;
this is what happens in such shows.

09:30.042 --> 09:32.084
There's a lot that
happens in my heart too.

09:32.876 --> 09:34.376
So what? - Nothing.

09:34.959 --> 09:36.292
Just stop drinking.

09:38.376 --> 09:40.001
We haven't lost anything yet.

09:41.709 --> 09:42.834
You were a star yesterday.

09:43.001 --> 09:45.292
And you still are.
- Are you finished?

09:45.834 --> 09:46.834
Can I go?

09:48.834 --> 09:49.959
Yeah, go on.

09:50.501 --> 09:51.667
But, this isn't Mumbai.

09:51.917 --> 09:53.042
Sir your car.

09:55.501 --> 09:56.542
Where will you go?

09:56.667 --> 09:57.959
In this strange city?

10:00.042 --> 10:02.459
If you meet with an accident
in this state, you'll end up dead.

10:03.084 --> 10:05.292
You know me well, Vivek.

10:07.042 --> 10:08.709
I don't drink to die.

10:09.292 --> 10:10.626
But, I would die for a drink.

10:12.084 --> 10:15.376
So see you, Vivek. - Rahul.

10:26.709 --> 10:31.709
"The time's standing still."

10:32.834 --> 10:37.584
"How did this happen."

10:38.667 --> 10:43.792
"I want you to come in my life."

10:44.459 --> 10:49.834
"Like a wish comes true."

10:50.001 --> 10:55.501
"You're the satisfaction
of my soul."

10:55.876 --> 10:59.959
"You're my faith."

11:00.001 --> 11:04.209
And this award
goes to Rahul Jaykar!

11:05.334 --> 11:10.584
"Bless me with your grace."

11:11.251 --> 11:15.876
"Take a look at me as well."

11:16.209 --> 11:19.167
Rahul Jaykar has been honored
with the best male singer award.

11:19.251 --> 11:22.042
RJ the most popular Indian singer.

11:23.042 --> 11:28.084
RJ's new song is super hit.

11:30.751 --> 11:35.334
RJ! RJ! RJ!

11:35.417 --> 11:39.334
RJ! RJ! RJ!

11:39.417 --> 11:44.584
"Are you listening?"

11:45.209 --> 11:49.667
III am crying-"

11:50.959 --> 11:55.042
"Are you listening?"

11:55.876 --> 11:59.584
III am crying-"

11:59.792 --> 12:04.959
"You are listening, aren't you?"

12:05.542 --> 12:10.917
III am crying-"

12:11.459 --> 12:16.251
"You are listening, aren't you?"

12:16.334 --> 12:24.001
III am crying-"

12:42.459 --> 12:44.001
Oh no!

12:45.542 --> 12:46.709
Sorry!
Are you Okay?

12:47.126 --> 12:48.167
What okay?

12:48.334 --> 12:49.584
It's a sunny day, right?

12:49.834 --> 12:51.876
So, you're driving
with your goggles.

12:52.334 --> 12:54.292
You made me drop
all the vegetables.

12:54.459 --> 12:57.251
I just lost 86 rupees. - 86 rupees.

13:02.209 --> 13:06.376
It's a lot of money.
- What are you looking at?

13:07.459 --> 13:09.542
Pick up the remaining tomatoes.
Come on.

13:09.709 --> 13:10.709
Yes.

13:13.751 --> 13:15.792
Three were crushed under the car.

13:19.001 --> 13:23.334
I'll send you the money.
Give me your address.

13:24.084 --> 13:28.042
No. You should be taught a lesson.

13:28.751 --> 13:29.751
Bend down.

13:29.876 --> 13:32.459
Bend down!
And pick them all up.

13:33.626 --> 13:34.626
Sorry.

13:49.709 --> 13:51.501
They are spoilt now.

14:01.501 --> 14:02.501
Forget it.

14:06.834 --> 14:07.917
I am sorry Ms..

14:08.001 --> 14:09.876
That was two days ration.

14:10.626 --> 14:11.792
You ruined it.

14:31.542 --> 14:33.542
Make me a large.
- The bar's closed.

14:34.959 --> 14:36.542
Make me a drink. - The bar's..

14:39.542 --> 14:40.959
Mr. RJ sir, you!

14:41.876 --> 14:44.042
Sir, I'm a big fan.

14:44.084 --> 14:45.792
Make me a drink.

14:46.126 --> 14:48.167
Sir. - I'm okay.

14:48.959 --> 14:49.959
Make me a drink.

14:50.167 --> 14:53.126
I am sorry, sir.
But the bar's closed.

14:53.292 --> 14:55.167
The owner's father
passed away, so..

14:56.584 --> 14:57.792
Father's dead.

14:59.376 --> 15:00.792
So, where can I get a drink?

15:01.042 --> 15:03.042
Sir, I can give you
drink mixed with coke.

15:03.417 --> 15:05.542
No one will know.

15:07.084 --> 15:08.292
Forget it.

15:09.709 --> 15:11.959
Someone's father is dead.
Why cheat.

15:14.501 --> 15:16.001
Then, can you tell
me if there's a bar around.

15:16.251 --> 15:17.251
I'll be grateful.

15:18.001 --> 15:19.001
Bar?

15:19.126 --> 15:22.334
Oh yes, there's a beer
bar just a few paces ahead.

15:23.042 --> 15:24.376
It stays open until 2 o'clock.

15:24.459 --> 15:27.209
But, that place
isn't your standards.

15:28.834 --> 15:30.459
I'm not up to my standards, either.

15:30.792 --> 15:31.792
What?

15:34.542 --> 15:35.709
Nothing.

15:36.709 --> 15:37.709
Thank you.

15:39.792 --> 15:45.501
"Destiny's are lost."

15:45.667 --> 15:50.792
"The path's forlorn."

15:51.542 --> 15:56.917
"Come and take me away."

"That's all I pray for."

16:02.709 --> 16:08.251

16:34.959 --> 16:37.376

16:44.501 --> 16:50.001
"Bless me with your grace."

16:50.334 --> 16:54.751
"Take a look at me as well."

17:06.709 --> 17:11.126
"Are you listening?"

17:11.501 --> 17:16.334
"Why I am crying.".

17:29.334 --> 17:30.667
Keep this inside.

17:30.876 --> 17:32.751
What are you doing?
- He's here.

17:33.584 --> 17:35.084
Who? - Don't know.

17:35.792 --> 17:37.251
He was drunk and driving.

17:37.542 --> 17:39.417
I barely managed to escape.

17:40.709 --> 17:43.126
He's no-good.
Just enjoying for free.

17:43.292 --> 17:44.709
Don't look at him.

17:45.542 --> 17:47.126
Forget it. The manager's watching.

17:49.292 --> 17:50.667
Go on.

18:01.626 --> 18:07.167
"The time's standing still."

18:07.584 --> 18:12.334
"How did this happen."

18:13.459 --> 18:18.834
"I want you came in my life."

18:19.292 --> 18:24.042
"Like a wish comes true."

18:24.792 --> 18:30.251
"You're the satisfaction

19:02.292 --> 19:06.751
"Are you listening?"

19:07.167 --> 19:12.501
"Why I am crying.".

19:29.917 --> 19:31.376
Salim, he's right here.

19:31.542 --> 19:32.584
I'm going to yell at him.

19:32.667 --> 19:34.501
He's coming, isn't here?
He's here, right?

19:35.251 --> 19:36.501
Look, I..

19:37.251 --> 19:38.917
Hello. - Hello, sir..

19:39.001 --> 19:41.501
RJ. - Yes.

19:41.751 --> 19:44.709
Rahul... Jayekar! - Yes.

19:45.251 --> 19:48.501
This song.. - You, at our hotel?

19:49.709 --> 19:54.417
And, I was singing your song. - No.

19:54.667 --> 19:57.501
Salil. I said such rubbish.

19:57.584 --> 20:00.251
I want to talk to you.
- Sir, sorry..

20:00.459 --> 20:02.584
Sit. - And,
I made you do such stupid things.

20:02.876 --> 20:05.334
Pick up vegetables..
- Be quiet for a minute.

20:09.626 --> 20:11.126
What's your name?

20:12.292 --> 20:14.084
Aarohi Keshav Shirke.

20:15.042 --> 20:16.042
Aarohi.

20:18.459 --> 20:21.751
You've a great voice.
- No, I was just..

20:21.876 --> 20:23.751
Just listen.

20:25.667 --> 20:26.667
Yes.

20:27.417 --> 20:29.542
You sung my song better than me.

20:32.376 --> 20:34.501
I just realized my flaws.

20:35.917 --> 20:38.251
The mistakes I made in my songs.

20:39.709 --> 20:42.876
I never felt any
of my song like this.

20:43.584 --> 20:45.209
You're joking.

20:46.251 --> 20:47.251
No.

20:48.376 --> 20:51.001
I never joke when concerns singing.

20:54.084 --> 20:56.001
Rahul! Rahul!

20:56.751 --> 20:57.876
Are you mad?

20:58.042 --> 21:00.001
I found your car crashed,
in the middle of the road.

21:00.209 --> 21:02.084
Whether you're dead or alive,
you could've have..

21:03.167 --> 21:04.667
What are you doing here?

21:05.251 --> 21:06.042
Let's go.

21:06.084 --> 21:07.126
Let's go from here.

21:07.751 --> 21:10.084
Rahul, let's go.
- Don't go, Aarohi.

21:11.292 --> 21:12.042
Let's go.

21:12.084 --> 21:13.167
Let's leave.

21:13.709 --> 21:15.334
He's a drunkard.

21:15.751 --> 21:18.876
He was just trying
to convince her..

21:19.001 --> 21:19.834
Yes, let's go.

21:19.917 --> 21:22.626
Is 1 am. And,
the police can raid any moment.

21:22.709 --> 21:24.584
But, he's such a big artist.

21:25.001 --> 21:26.167
If we leave..

21:26.626 --> 21:28.709
He won't know. Let's go.

21:28.834 --> 21:31.001
Deepak's looking all over for you.

21:31.501 --> 21:33.584
We've four more shows to do.
If this continues..

21:34.167 --> 21:35.792
...we'll have to
return all the money.

21:35.959 --> 21:37.751
We will return the money, Vivek.

21:37.959 --> 21:39.584
What are you saying Rahul?

21:39.751 --> 21:42.626
Listen. I've to go
back to Mumbai tomorrow.

21:43.376 --> 21:47.042
This singer, Aarohi.. - Who?

21:47.251 --> 21:48.084
Where's everyone?

21:48.167 --> 21:49.042
Forget it, let's go.

21:49.084 --> 21:51.584
Rahul, let's go. - Wait.

21:52.084 --> 21:55.334
Where's everyone? - They all left.

21:58.334 --> 22:00.084
I want that girl's address.

22:00.167 --> 22:01.959
Where does she stay? - Kolhapanaji!

22:02.209 --> 22:04.292
I'm going- - What?

22:04.626 --> 22:05.917
Give me the car keys.

22:06.084 --> 22:07.376
What are you doing? - Give it.

22:07.876 --> 22:09.126
What's going on?

22:09.876 --> 22:12.209
What are you doing?
- Pay for the whiskey.

22:12.292 --> 22:13.292
Rahul!

22:14.126 --> 22:15.751
Rahul! How will I go home?

22:31.959 --> 22:34.584
'You've a great voice.'

22:36.792 --> 22:39.001
'You sung my song better than me.'

22:46.126 --> 22:48.001
'l just realized my flaws.'

22:49.167 --> 22:51.542
'The mistakes I made in my songs.'

22:52.584 --> 22:55.834
'l never felt any
of my song like this.'

23:08.167 --> 23:09.167
Aarohi!

23:13.084 --> 23:14.084
Aarohi!

23:19.126 --> 23:20.126
Aarohi!

23:22.209 --> 23:23.209
Aarohi!

23:24.126 --> 23:26.167
Hi. - Oh, God!

23:26.376 --> 23:29.001
I want to talk to you, come down.

23:30.417 --> 23:31.417
Come down.

23:32.584 --> 23:34.626
I can't come. - Fine, I'm coming.

23:36.376 --> 23:41.084
No. no. no. - What?

23:45.417 --> 23:47.209
I'm coming. - Come down.

24:22.042 --> 24:23.167
What are you doing?

24:24.251 --> 24:26.001
What happened?

24:26.501 --> 24:27.501
Come on.

24:28.209 --> 24:30.959
What happened?

24:31.917 --> 24:32.917
Come here.

24:33.292 --> 24:34.751
What are you doing?

24:36.834 --> 24:39.126
I'm not allowed
to meet anyone here.

24:39.417 --> 24:42.292
If the bar's management sees me..

24:42.376 --> 24:44.751
...he'll deduct a day's salary.
- Sorry.

24:45.792 --> 24:47.584
I had to come.

24:49.001 --> 24:53.001
We couldn't complete
our conversation at the bar..

24:53.376 --> 24:54.376
What?

24:54.792 --> 24:55.792
So...

24:59.792 --> 25:03.501
You want to be a singer?
- Who said that?

25:03.876 --> 25:04.876
You did.

25:06.667 --> 25:09.542
You were looking at Lata's picture.

25:11.001 --> 25:13.292
Just like a child
looks at the moon.

25:15.001 --> 25:16.376
Wants to touch it.

25:18.459 --> 25:21.834
That look told me everything.

25:24.251 --> 25:26.126
Everyone looks at the moon.

25:28.917 --> 25:31.167
What good is that? - The beginning.

25:32.626 --> 25:34.209
Of every successful journey.

25:35.959 --> 25:40.417
You know,
the best artists in the world..

25:41.709 --> 25:44.001
...are the ones who
have their own style.

25:45.001 --> 25:47.334
A style,
that doesn't come from imitation.

25:48.959 --> 25:51.042
A style, that's born with them.

25:53.501 --> 25:55.042
And, you've got that.

25:56.042 --> 25:57.459
That special thing.

25:58.292 --> 26:01.667
I wonder what's that thing..

26:02.626 --> 26:04.917
...that you heard,
but the others can't.

26:05.709 --> 26:09.834
I tried really hard.

26:12.626 --> 26:14.542
But, no one gave me a chance.

26:15.042 --> 26:16.417
That's why I am here.

26:18.709 --> 26:20.417
Because,
I want to make you successful.

26:21.001 --> 26:23.459
I want to make you the greatest
singer of this millennium.

26:26.292 --> 26:33.001
Look I... not the
kind of girl you think.

26:35.417 --> 26:38.042
I don't say these
things to those girls.

26:43.834 --> 26:45.126
But, what to do?

26:46.459 --> 26:47.792
I think I am in love.

26:49.251 --> 26:50.709
I've gone crazy.

26:51.709 --> 26:55.917
Now, whether it's the art
or the artist, that's yet to say.

26:57.834 --> 26:58.876
We'll know.

27:01.292 --> 27:03.709
But, only after you're sober.

27:12.959 --> 27:14.376
Listen. - What?

27:15.001 --> 27:16.542
You won't work in that bar.

27:17.751 --> 27:19.167
You'll leave that job.

27:20.417 --> 27:21.792
Because I say so.

27:26.417 --> 27:27.834
Do you believe me?

27:35.501 --> 27:36.501
Listen.

27:40.792 --> 27:41.792
What?

27:43.167 --> 27:44.167
Nothing.

27:47.709 --> 27:48.959
Just like that.

28:07.626 --> 28:09.167
Aarohi, are you okay?

28:10.834 --> 28:12.959
Yes. I am fine.

28:21.001 --> 28:22.292
25,000!

28:22.959 --> 28:25.834
That's what I spent
to bring you here.

28:26.459 --> 28:30.084
I suggest,
you pay up and you can leave.

28:33.209 --> 28:34.209
What?

28:34.709 --> 28:35.917
Don't have it.

28:36.542 --> 28:37.584
Go.

28:41.751 --> 28:42.876
Shankar sir.

28:44.959 --> 28:46.584
It's the question of my life.

28:47.209 --> 28:48.626
Please let me go.

28:49.542 --> 28:52.042
I'll return your money
once I get to Mumbai.

28:53.292 --> 28:56.417
No one's going to pay
even 200 for this face.

28:56.959 --> 28:58.084
What do you think?

28:58.167 --> 29:00.376
This is no orphanage.

29:01.167 --> 29:03.042
Pay up and leave.

29:03.501 --> 29:05.376
You take up 50 percent.

29:06.417 --> 29:07.709
And, what are we left with?

29:07.917 --> 29:09.959
We've to buy food
with our own money.

29:10.542 --> 29:13.126
It'll take me months
to arrange that kind of money.

29:13.292 --> 29:14.584
Yeah! Exactly.

29:14.667 --> 29:18.334
That's why you steal
money from the money-bag.

29:18.959 --> 29:20.501
What else do you expect me to do?

29:20.792 --> 29:23.334
You cut 100 rupees
for minor mistakes.

29:23.542 --> 29:25.042
200 for coming late.

29:25.292 --> 29:26.959
And my salary.. - Babu!

29:27.042 --> 29:28.709
What's wrong with her?

29:28.917 --> 29:30.834
She's constantly
saying "I want to go".

29:31.084 --> 29:32.292
She was fine until yesterday.

29:32.751 --> 29:34.626
That singer RJ that
came to bar yesterday..

29:34.709 --> 29:36.251
...Is the one that provoked her.

29:36.334 --> 29:37.542
That he'll make her a singer.

29:37.626 --> 29:39.167
Give her a chance to sing in films.

29:39.501 --> 29:41.084
Since then.. - I see.

29:41.751 --> 29:44.209
RJ. That singer.

29:45.667 --> 29:46.876
Just a minute.

29:48.251 --> 29:49.251
Look.

29:49.459 --> 29:51.667
His picture's in the papers.

29:52.501 --> 29:54.834
He had a fight
with a man yesterday.

29:55.459 --> 29:58.542
He left before the show started.

29:59.126 --> 30:01.959
The organizer of the
show was crying on camera.

30:02.417 --> 30:04.167
There are many other
stories about him.

30:04.417 --> 30:05.792
But, no news about his work.

30:07.876 --> 30:09.834
He'll get you work.

30:11.251 --> 30:15.876
A man that's living off
his hit songs of yesteryear..

30:16.126 --> 30:18.959
...can only pass time with you.

30:19.501 --> 30:20.709
Do you know why?

30:20.876 --> 30:22.959
Because you're worth it.

30:34.626 --> 30:37.834
Hello, sir... you..

30:40.834 --> 30:43.126
I am here for this girl..

30:43.459 --> 30:46.209
...because she's going
to a great singer.

30:47.084 --> 30:50.292
But, I can see her future, not you.

30:52.709 --> 30:53.959
One more thing.

30:55.667 --> 30:56.876
You run a bar.

30:58.042 --> 30:59.542
You live off singers.

31:01.126 --> 31:02.876
Learn to respect singers.

31:04.626 --> 31:06.251
Ones that sing at your bar.

31:07.709 --> 31:10.334
And the ones,
whose songs help you run your bar.

31:11.584 --> 31:12.584
Get that.

31:15.001 --> 31:17.376
Vivek, throw the money on his face.

31:18.501 --> 31:20.834
He isn't worthy of any respect.

31:22.917 --> 31:24.251
Let's go, Aarohi.

31:30.501 --> 31:32.251
Okay. Goodbye.

31:34.376 --> 31:36.001
What's all this, Rahul?

31:37.167 --> 31:38.292
This is it.

31:40.334 --> 31:42.584
I pray to Allah that
you're never heart-broken.

31:42.917 --> 31:44.709
If that happens, don't hesitate.

31:45.001 --> 31:48.709
I'll get you work,
and won't taunt you either.

32:04.709 --> 32:06.126
No, no, it's fine.

32:12.376 --> 32:13.584
I'll drop you.

32:14.876 --> 32:15.876
No.

32:16.084 --> 32:19.876
The place I stay,
isn't your standards.

32:26.167 --> 32:28.084
I've noted my number, address..

32:28.167 --> 32:29.626
...and my manager's
number in your diary.

32:29.709 --> 32:32.792
So, call me when you get a new sim.

32:33.042 --> 32:34.042
Okay-

32:34.292 --> 32:35.417
Don't forget.

32:37.917 --> 32:40.001
Thank you. - For what?

32:40.667 --> 32:42.209
For giving me new hope.

32:44.751 --> 32:46.042
Bye. - Bye,

32:58.626 --> 32:59.626
Listen.

33:00.542 --> 33:01.542
What?

33:02.042 --> 33:03.042
Nothing.

33:06.209 --> 33:07.459
Just like that.

33:32.459 --> 33:34.084
Father!

33:35.626 --> 33:36.626
Aarohi.

33:41.042 --> 33:42.626
You're back. - Yes.

33:44.542 --> 33:46.917
I was thinking about you. - Really?

33:47.251 --> 33:48.667
I even called you in my dreams.

33:50.001 --> 33:51.917
Your mother yelled at me. - Why?

33:52.001 --> 33:55.126
She called me crazy. - Father.

33:58.792 --> 34:01.126
But, you left for three months,
didn't you?

34:01.792 --> 34:05.376
And in one month..
- I'll tell you everything.

34:05.626 --> 34:07.001
But where's mother?

34:07.167 --> 34:08.333
At the station.

34:08.792 --> 34:10.167
Today's Thursday.

34:10.458 --> 34:12.542
She's gone to buy the
Maharashtra Rajya Lottery.

34:13.083 --> 34:15.042
She's been buying lottery
tickets for the past two years.

34:15.126 --> 34:17.626
But she's never won anything
more than 100 rupees.

34:19.083 --> 34:20.251
Enough!

34:21.292 --> 34:23.792
The daughter's back and
the father can't stop yapping.

34:24.042 --> 34:25.042
Mother.

34:29.708 --> 34:31.417
Why didn't you say you're coming?

34:31.792 --> 34:33.751
I would've prepared
something for you.

34:34.251 --> 34:37.542
We live off on fritters.

34:39.542 --> 34:42.626
But now that you're here,
we'll make something nice.

34:43.042 --> 34:46.042
Give me 100 rupees..

34:46.126 --> 34:48.626
...I'll get something
from the market.

34:49.126 --> 34:50.917
We'll make something good today.

34:54.333 --> 34:58.042
Mother, I..

34:59.001 --> 35:01.584
...didn't get paid. - Why?

35:02.501 --> 35:04.126
I met someone.

35:05.292 --> 35:08.584
He said he'll give me a
chance to be a singer, in films.

35:09.751 --> 35:15.542
So I.. - You believed him.
And quit your job.

35:35.917 --> 35:36.917
Mom.

35:39.126 --> 35:40.126
Mom.

35:41.667 --> 35:43.167
Everything will be okay.

35:43.626 --> 35:44.792
Trust..

35:45.709 --> 35:47.376
It's just a matter of few days.

35:47.584 --> 35:50.292
Once I start working.. - So?

35:51.542 --> 35:53.167
I only have 300 rupees.

35:54.042 --> 35:55.167
300 rupees..

35:56.209 --> 35:58.001
Your father doesn't earn a penny.

35:58.542 --> 36:02.376
He.. keeps repairing everyone's
radio and TV's for free.

36:02.584 --> 36:04.584
What are you saying?
- Let me speak.

36:05.167 --> 36:07.542
Is this why I sent
you to the best teachers?

36:09.126 --> 36:10.626
Taught you to speak good Hindi.

36:11.209 --> 36:12.667
So that you can become a great..

36:13.417 --> 36:15.292
I stitched clothes
to pay for your fees.

36:17.251 --> 36:19.959
Finally you found a job,
but you quit that as well.

36:20.584 --> 36:21.584
And..

36:24.459 --> 36:26.292
I don't win.. the jackpot either.

36:28.417 --> 36:29.751
I thought if you get some money..

36:29.834 --> 36:31.417
...I will manage a few months.

36:32.709 --> 36:35.751
Now, I'll have to
borrow from someone.

36:35.834 --> 36:37.084
No, mom.

36:37.542 --> 36:39.209
Let's see whether anyone
will lend me money or not. -Mom.

36:39.292 --> 36:42.792
Mom. Mom. Listen to me. - Aarohi.

36:44.042 --> 36:45.542
Let her go.

36:47.542 --> 36:50.834
Actually, it's not her fault.

36:51.667 --> 36:54.667
She's always seen poverty.

36:55.959 --> 36:58.251
And I never gave
her anything either.

36:58.834 --> 36:59.834
But look.

37:00.917 --> 37:04.417
All our hopes are with you.

37:05.667 --> 37:07.792
We want good things for you.

37:13.126 --> 37:14.126
Father.

37:14.584 --> 37:17.334
First time someone's
believed in me.

37:17.959 --> 37:20.334
First time I believed in someone.

37:20.834 --> 37:24.126
He came all the way from Goa,
only for me.

37:25.876 --> 37:28.501
And he's gone to talk
to someone for me, father.

37:28.709 --> 37:30.334
Uncle, I'm not joking.
- Deadlines, boys.

37:30.417 --> 37:31.417
There's a girl

37:34.292 --> 37:35.334
Thank God!

37:36.001 --> 37:37.251
Get married, straighten up!

37:37.417 --> 37:39.209
No, no, no, it's not that.

37:39.292 --> 37:40.292
No. - No.

37:40.959 --> 37:44.834
This girl's a very,
very, very, very good singer.

37:45.584 --> 37:47.709
I would've believed you
if you had said "very" once.

37:47.792 --> 37:49.251
Please cancel my
appointment for tomorrow.

37:49.501 --> 37:51.084
She was singing in a bar.

37:51.501 --> 37:53.584
Bar.. you mean where
you were obviously..

37:54.709 --> 37:55.709
Yes..

37:56.042 --> 37:57.542
But, what a voice.

37:57.667 --> 37:59.959
I had an entire bottle,
but I couldn't get drunk.

38:00.084 --> 38:01.709
Can you imagine?
- 15 minutes.

38:01.834 --> 38:04.876
Basically, I want you to
give her a chance to sing in films.

38:05.042 --> 38:06.751
Or, make an album.

38:07.542 --> 38:09.376
She's superb, uncle.
I can write that in blood.

38:09.709 --> 38:10.834
Do you have any blood left?

38:11.209 --> 38:12.042
Where is she?

38:12.084 --> 38:13.292
She stays here in Mumbai.

38:14.251 --> 38:15.542
She's from a poor family..

38:15.626 --> 38:18.167
...and performs out of
the city to make a living.

38:18.417 --> 38:19.667
In these small bars.

38:20.084 --> 38:21.917
But I am not going
to let that happen again.

38:22.501 --> 38:23.959
I really want to help her, uncle.

38:24.251 --> 38:25.501
She's a superstar.

38:28.792 --> 38:30.376
Superstar? - Yeah!

38:36.959 --> 38:42.626
A star, is someone whose songs,
and voice..

38:43.709 --> 38:46.917
...makes you want to..
Whistle.

38:48.626 --> 38:49.917
Whistle.

38:50.751 --> 38:53.126
Just like people used
to whistle at your performance.

38:53.209 --> 38:54.584
You were the star. You.

38:54.792 --> 38:56.042
She's better than me.

38:57.167 --> 39:00.042
She's amazing.
I'm telling you, she's amazing.

39:01.584 --> 39:02.584
Call her.

39:04.292 --> 39:06.417
I'll first hear
her and then decide.

39:06.626 --> 39:07.834
You're serious? - Yes.

39:08.459 --> 39:09.459
Yes.

39:11.501 --> 39:13.209
Thank you, uncle.

39:13.792 --> 39:15.542
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

39:15.709 --> 39:17.626
Out. Get out.

39:17.834 --> 39:18.834
Thank you.

39:19.917 --> 39:22.001
Listen to him. He's a good man.

39:26.584 --> 39:29.292
Excuse me, give me a simcard.
- Take this.

39:38.084 --> 39:40.959
You are leaving Deepak's show?

39:43.542 --> 39:45.209
You will forget to sing.

39:55.501 --> 39:57.126
Be careful.
Careful, please.

39:57.251 --> 39:58.251
Careful.

39:59.751 --> 40:01.751
Don't you dare tell
anyone about this!

40:02.042 --> 40:04.751
If any journalist or media-person asks you about him..

40:05.042 --> 40:07.667
...then say,
he's gone to London for a show.

40:08.751 --> 40:12.626
In the meanwhile, nobody comes in,
nobody talks to him.

40:12.751 --> 40:13.917
You get that.

40:21.376 --> 40:22.792
Hello. - Hello.

40:23.501 --> 40:26.126
Can I talk to Mr.
Rahul? My name's Aarohi.

40:26.376 --> 40:28.376
He asked me to call me.

40:28.584 --> 40:31.709
I'm a singer, we met in Goa
and he said.. - Rahul isn't here.

40:32.584 --> 40:34.792
He's gone to London, for his shows.

40:34.917 --> 40:37.667
And he'll return after 20-25 days.
- 20-25 days?

40:39.626 --> 40:41.542
Yes, but just listen to me..

40:42.334 --> 40:44.042
Hello! Hello!

40:52.792 --> 40:58.126
"It's your fault, my heart!"

40:58.626 --> 41:03.917
"it's your fault, my heart!"

41:04.459 --> 41:11.417
"Why did you trust him?"

41:13.042 --> 41:16.876
"All the promises were fake."

41:19.084 --> 41:22.667
"The one you followed here."

41:23.584 --> 41:28.584
"Beloved's nowhere."

41:29.709 --> 41:32.251
"Beloved's nowhere."

41:32.376 --> 41:36.126
"Beloved's nowhere."

41:36.626 --> 41:42.126
"Now, stop seeing those dreams."

41:42.501 --> 41:47.001
"Now, shatter those
dreams yourself."

41:47.042 --> 41:51.917
"Beloved's nowhere."

41:52.042 --> 41:53.584
We don't have evidence..

41:54.501 --> 41:55.792
...whether Deepak's involved or not.

41:56.209 --> 41:58.376
But I swear Rahul.

41:59.334 --> 42:02.584
I will find out whoever he is and..

42:06.209 --> 42:07.792
Did Aarohi call?

42:10.334 --> 42:11.334
Not yet.

42:11.417 --> 42:12.792
Is your phone on?

42:15.876 --> 42:16.876
24/7.

42:26.542 --> 42:28.667
Tell this girl that
it's a wrong number.

42:30.584 --> 42:31.751
Hello. - Hello.

42:31.959 --> 42:33.209
Hello, is Rahul back.

42:33.917 --> 42:34.959
I am sorry, this is a wrong number.

42:35.334 --> 42:36.334
What?

42:36.959 --> 42:38.292
Hello. Hello.

42:39.917 --> 42:50.667
"There's punishment
for every mistake."

42:51.584 --> 42:56.751
"if you're destined for sadness."

42:56.834 --> 43:02.084
"There's always a reason."

43:03.626 --> 43:08.876
"All my pain has
conjured in my tears."

43:09.459 --> 43:14.001
"My tears don't
stop trickling down."

43:14.126 --> 43:16.001
"Beloved's nowhere."

43:16.126 --> 43:19.417
"Beloved's nowhere."

43:20.209 --> 43:23.001
"Beloved's nowhere."

43:23.084 --> 43:25.834
"Beloved's nowhere."

43:29.042 --> 43:31.501
Okay. Give the money.

43:35.459 --> 43:37.626
See you. Goodbye.

43:53.542 --> 43:56.459
This fracture showed
me the importance of my legs.

43:56.667 --> 43:57.751
Take care.

44:01.542 --> 44:02.876
Great.

44:03.251 --> 44:04.251
Good news.

44:04.584 --> 44:06.084
It's time to celebrate.

44:07.001 --> 44:08.792
I'll have a drink with you as well.

44:10.667 --> 44:12.417
Where to? - To look for Aarohi.

44:14.001 --> 44:15.001
Come on.

44:15.209 --> 44:17.584
Excuse me, is this Rahul's house?

44:17.959 --> 44:19.459
Yes, this is his home.

44:19.542 --> 44:21.126
But, sir's out of town.

44:21.209 --> 44:22.959
I don't know when he's coming back.

44:26.542 --> 44:29.542
Vivek sir said he'll be
coming back after 20-25 days.

44:30.459 --> 44:32.042
It's been two months now.

44:32.126 --> 44:33.167
He hasn't returned.

44:33.251 --> 44:34.709
What can I do if he hasn't?

44:34.792 --> 44:36.417
I'll let you know
once he comes back.

44:36.501 --> 44:37.501
Please leave.

44:43.709 --> 44:45.709
Please give this top
Rahul sir when he returns.

44:49.126 --> 44:50.751
Tell him Aarohi was here.

44:51.751 --> 44:53.001
I tried calling him many times.

44:53.167 --> 44:54.751
I'll give it to
him once he returns.

44:54.834 --> 44:56.126
Please go now.

45:27.292 --> 45:29.167
Coming!

45:32.876 --> 45:34.001
What happened?

45:36.834 --> 45:38.042
Sister-in-law, Salim.

45:38.334 --> 45:40.001
Aarohi. What's wrong?

45:41.084 --> 45:42.084
Salim.

45:42.251 --> 45:43.751
What's wrong? Who is it?

45:51.334 --> 45:52.709
What's wrong, Aarohi?

45:53.167 --> 45:54.626
I want a job.

45:57.376 --> 46:01.876
Any place. Good, bad or cheap.

46:02.626 --> 46:03.667
Just get me work.

46:04.292 --> 46:06.501
I need money, Salim.

46:06.959 --> 46:08.459
Come in.

46:12.126 --> 46:14.751
Sir. A girl gave this.

46:17.501 --> 46:18.001
When did she come?

46:18.084 --> 46:19.376
Yesterday evening.

46:19.459 --> 46:21.709
She said she called
you two-three times.

46:21.834 --> 46:23.834
Maybe she spoke to Vivek sir.

46:24.084 --> 46:27.001
She looked decent, so I told you.

46:28.876 --> 46:30.709
Thank you. - Welcome sir.

46:36.084 --> 46:37.667
What the hell is wrong with you?

46:37.834 --> 46:39.417
Don't ask why I did that?

46:39.876 --> 46:40.876
You know.

46:42.001 --> 46:44.917
I told that girl never
to sing in a bar again.

46:45.042 --> 46:47.167
I told her she'll
be a successful singer.

46:47.292 --> 46:49.251
I told her she will be a star.

46:51.542 --> 46:52.959
I went to her hotel, Vivek.

46:53.001 --> 46:54.251
She didn't come to me.

46:54.501 --> 46:55.792
And what did you do?

46:56.126 --> 46:57.542
You humiliated her.

46:57.751 --> 46:59.001
You hid her calls from me.

46:59.959 --> 47:01.001
You lied to her.

47:02.126 --> 47:05.751
You treated her like an enemy.
- Yes, because I'm your friend.

47:06.834 --> 47:08.251
I've been with you for years.

47:08.792 --> 47:10.751
You could've shown
some respect for me.

47:10.959 --> 47:14.084
And for any darn girl..
- She's no ordinary girl!

47:16.167 --> 47:17.667
This is why I did it.

47:18.376 --> 47:19.917
So that you stay away from her.

47:20.959 --> 47:22.667
I didn't want this to happen, man!

47:24.001 --> 47:26.334
First alcohol, then drugs.

47:26.626 --> 47:29.626
And now.. - Whatever I do
with my life is my problem, Vivek.

47:29.751 --> 47:30.251
No!

47:30.334 --> 47:31.876
This isn't your personal problem.

47:31.959 --> 47:33.167
I've been with you for 10 years.

47:33.542 --> 47:35.584
I looked after you, your career.

47:35.834 --> 47:38.001
I saw your success, your downfall.

47:38.292 --> 47:42.126
But, I can't see you
handing over your success..

47:42.292 --> 47:44.376
...which you need the most now,
to some girl.

47:44.959 --> 47:48.042
I can't see you doing
this for someone else instead.

47:48.709 --> 47:51.584
I feel sad. It hurts me.

47:51.834 --> 47:55.042
To know that you've stopped
recognizing your talent.

47:55.876 --> 47:58.626
You've forgotten your own voice.

47:59.042 --> 48:01.042
One that's unmatched.

48:01.584 --> 48:02.584
Why?

48:02.834 --> 48:04.626
Why don't you see yourself?

48:04.876 --> 48:06.709
Why don't you hear yourself?

48:06.959 --> 48:08.584
You call me your enemy.

48:09.792 --> 48:12.917
Just.. look at yourself.

48:15.667 --> 48:16.834
You're right.

48:18.542 --> 48:20.876
But the truth is,
I don't want anything.

48:21.584 --> 48:25.751
Fame, fortune,
success, money, respect.

48:26.209 --> 48:28.792
It should all go to
the one that deserves it.

48:29.751 --> 48:32.001
Give the bread to the
one that's hungry for it.

48:33.001 --> 48:35.792
And I've seen that in that girl.

48:37.251 --> 48:38.834
And I no longer have that.

48:39.709 --> 48:41.084
And I've admitted this truth.

48:41.667 --> 48:42.917
You should too.

48:43.709 --> 48:45.792
Your friend can't pay
you your salary anymore.

48:46.251 --> 48:48.792
RJ. - You're a free man, Vivek.

48:49.751 --> 48:51.709
You can go anywhere you want.

49:05.001 --> 49:06.001
Hello.

49:06.167 --> 49:08.042
Can I talk to Aarohi, please?

49:08.126 --> 49:10.126
She's performing? - Where?

49:10.292 --> 49:11.709
Hotel Nightingale.

49:13.334 --> 49:19.084
"What seemed like reality,
turned out to be an illusion."

49:19.251 --> 49:24.542
"A saga, that was bound
for a twist, has ended."

49:24.709 --> 49:27.251
"I forgot, so did she."

49:27.542 --> 49:33.959
"How do I tell
everyone about this?"

49:34.292 --> 49:39.501
"I've slowly compromised myself."

49:40.042 --> 49:44.626
"I've slowly controlled myself."

49:44.751 --> 49:49.792
"Beloved's nowhere."

49:50.792 --> 49:53.292
"Beloved's nowhere."

49:53.709 --> 49:56.292
"Beloved's nowhere."

49:56.459 --> 50:02.501
"Beloved's nowhere."

50:03.584 --> 50:08.917
"it's your fault, my heart!"

50:09.459 --> 50:14.542
"it's your fault, my heart!"

50:15.209 --> 50:21.626
"Why did you trust him?"

50:23.334 --> 50:24.584
Aarohi! Aarohi!

50:24.792 --> 50:25.667
Please let me explain.

50:25.751 --> 50:28.042
Look. I work here.

50:28.167 --> 50:29.626
Don't create a scene.

50:30.001 --> 50:31.626
I got this job with
great difficulty.

50:31.709 --> 50:33.459
Damn the job,
I want to speak to you.

50:33.584 --> 50:34.792
Why should I?

50:35.501 --> 50:37.209
I've been waiting for two months.

50:37.459 --> 50:40.501
First time I hurt my
parents and trusted someone.

50:40.709 --> 50:42.167
I started dreaming.

50:43.542 --> 50:45.376
Everything seemed true.

50:45.626 --> 50:46.792
What now?

50:48.626 --> 50:49.626
Go ahead.

50:50.584 --> 50:52.542
You can vent all your anger.

50:53.792 --> 50:55.501
I am your culprit.

50:57.709 --> 50:58.917
But, I am not.

51:00.667 --> 51:01.917
I waited for you.

51:02.751 --> 51:04.001
Get in.

51:04.417 --> 51:05.417
Come on. - What are you doing?

51:05.501 --> 51:07.459
Get in. - What are you doing?

51:07.792 --> 51:09.501
What are you doing? - Come on.

51:10.876 --> 51:12.251
I want to tell you a story.

51:15.001 --> 51:17.001
I don't want to hear your story.

51:23.001 --> 51:24.001
Let's go.

51:54.792 --> 51:56.626
If all that happened with you..

51:57.459 --> 51:59.042
...then, why didn't
they show it on TV?

51:59.167 --> 52:00.501
Aarohi, the TV..

52:01.001 --> 52:02.417
Please forget it.

52:02.959 --> 52:04.626
I want to keep my promise.

52:06.251 --> 52:08.251
In fact I brought
Sehgal uncle along.

52:09.001 --> 52:10.584
He's called you at his office.

52:13.334 --> 52:15.251
But, I cannot quit this job.

52:19.959 --> 52:21.334
I cannot take a risk again.

52:21.709 --> 52:22.792
Then don't..

52:23.042 --> 52:25.542
You can keep the job
until you're satisfied.

52:25.834 --> 52:28.251
But, you've believed me so far,
then why not another day.

52:31.709 --> 52:33.376
Be ready at 11 am tomorrow.

52:35.417 --> 52:36.417
Please.

52:39.751 --> 52:40.751
Please!

52:43.542 --> 52:45.001
You sing well, dear.

52:45.667 --> 52:46.667
You're talented.

52:47.126 --> 52:48.667
And you understand tunes.

52:49.126 --> 52:52.084
But, for playback
singing and albums..

52:52.959 --> 52:55.334
...you'll need some grooming.

52:55.792 --> 52:57.001
Just a little.

52:58.334 --> 53:01.334
Because singing in recording
studios with new songs..

53:01.542 --> 53:04.084
...can get a little overwhelming.
- Okay.

53:04.751 --> 53:08.417
Fine.. we'll start your
vocal training from next week.

53:09.167 --> 53:10.126
Yes, I'll do that.

53:10.209 --> 53:12.376
I'll train her. - Fantastic!

53:12.834 --> 53:14.001
What else do you want?

53:21.709 --> 53:23.917
So many awards, records.

53:25.209 --> 53:26.626
They're all yours.

53:27.167 --> 53:30.834
They're mine, or not. I don't know.

53:31.459 --> 53:32.376
What?

53:32.459 --> 53:33.626
Nothing.

53:34.459 --> 53:35.459
Don't worry.

53:35.584 --> 53:38.084
Someday you'll
come with your award.

53:38.584 --> 53:40.001
You'll have more awards than me.

53:40.376 --> 53:41.376
I promise.

53:54.209 --> 53:55.209
What?

53:57.126 --> 53:58.126
Nothing.

54:00.709 --> 54:02.001
Just like that.

54:22.501 --> 54:23.709
I can't do it.

54:24.792 --> 54:26.334
Okay, listen. I will show you.

54:26.501 --> 54:27.751
It's in B flat.

54:29.709 --> 54:36.084
"Just tell me,
whether I want it or not."

54:38.334 --> 54:45.084
"Show me the way to your heart,
whether I want it or not."

54:48.626 --> 54:50.001
You sing so well.

54:51.042 --> 54:53.042
It's your training not me.

54:54.292 --> 54:55.834
Let's start singing.

54:56.501 --> 55:03.709
"Just tell me,
whether I want it or not."

55:05.542 --> 55:12.126
"Show me the way to your heart,
whether I want it or not."

55:14.501 --> 55:22.709
"Let me tell you, that
I don't have faith in my love."

55:23.501 --> 55:25.584
"Still, the heart thought.."

55:25.709 --> 55:32.209
"..now that we're here,
why not ask."

55:32.459 --> 55:38.876
"Just tell me,
whether I want it or not."

55:41.334 --> 55:48.126
"Show me the way to your heart,
whether I want it or not."

56:08.001 --> 56:16.959
"I never had such desires before."

56:17.042 --> 56:25.959
"I never tried this
hard to meet anyone."

56:26.292 --> 56:33.084
"Solve my confusion,
whether I want it or not."

56:35.292 --> 56:42.209
"Express it through your eyes,
whether I want it or not."

56:43.084 --> 56:46.584
Aarohi! Aarohi! Aarohi!

56:49.376 --> 56:50.834
Ladies and Gentlemen.

56:51.126 --> 56:54.126
The time has come,
for me to introduce you all..

56:54.209 --> 56:57.084
...to the nightingale of India,
and our country's..

56:57.167 --> 56:59.084
...latest singing sensation.

56:59.251 --> 57:02.417
The beautiful,
the talented, the wonderful!

57:02.501 --> 57:06.084
Aarohi Keshav Shirke!

57:23.209 --> 57:24.209
Yes, dad.

57:24.334 --> 57:25.876
Rahul. How are you, son?

57:26.626 --> 57:28.959
Everything fine?
- Everything fine, dad.

57:30.001 --> 57:31.459
In fact, I'm really happy.

57:33.084 --> 57:34.292
After a long time.

57:35.001 --> 57:37.084
You're in love, huh!

57:37.334 --> 57:41.667
"Just tell me..

57:43.167 --> 57:44.209
How did you know?

57:44.667 --> 57:46.001
I'm your father.

57:46.959 --> 57:48.126
Come.

57:48.292 --> 57:51.167
When the son's in love,
the father knows.

57:52.084 --> 58:00.167
"Show me the way to your heart,
whether I want it or not."

58:17.334 --> 58:18.126
What happened?

58:18.209 --> 58:20.126
Sir, she needs five more minutes.

58:23.209 --> 58:25.001
It's been half an hour, Rahul.

58:25.626 --> 58:27.834
Is there a problem?
- No, sir. There's no problem.

58:36.917 --> 58:37.917
Aarohi.

58:41.084 --> 58:42.084
Come out.

58:50.542 --> 58:51.542
Let's go.

58:59.084 --> 59:00.959
I cannot sing.

59:03.667 --> 59:05.542
Aarohi, we all get nervous.

59:07.501 --> 59:08.501
I was too.

59:09.751 --> 59:11.209
I ran away from the studio.

59:13.001 --> 59:14.001
It's okay.

59:14.917 --> 59:15.917
No.

59:19.042 --> 59:20.959
The bar was a different story.

59:22.626 --> 59:24.876
Making mistakes were okay.

59:26.334 --> 59:28.917
But, here..
amongst these big people..

59:29.042 --> 59:30.584
You're not alone.

59:32.751 --> 59:33.959
I am with you.

59:37.084 --> 59:38.417
Please, come out.

59:43.167 --> 59:45.042
I cannot sing.

59:54.126 --> 59:55.584
Aarohi, I love you.

59:59.042 --> 01:00:00.084
I love you.

01:00:03.459 --> 01:00:05.292
I've waited too long for this day.

01:00:06.876 --> 01:00:08.042
More than you.

01:00:09.834 --> 01:00:11.834
Come out for me.

01:00:14.459 --> 01:00:15.459
Please.

01:00:36.376 --> 01:00:40.501
"I've small dreams."

01:00:41.126 --> 01:00:45.209
"Dreams have songs."

01:00:45.584 --> 01:00:49.709
"Songs have life."

01:00:50.167 --> 01:00:53.917
"Love and affection."

01:00:54.376 --> 01:00:58.667
"I don't dream any longer."

01:00:59.084 --> 01:01:03.042
"That's without you."

01:01:03.584 --> 01:01:11.667
"I'm finally saying,
what I didn't so far."

01:01:11.959 --> 01:01:20.626
"The heart trusts you,
more than me."

01:01:20.959 --> 01:01:25.251
"I weave dreams about us,
in my empty moments."

01:01:25.459 --> 01:01:29.709
"You're in love with me."

01:01:29.959 --> 01:01:37.834
"I'll never ask you,
whether I want to or not."

01:01:39.001 --> 01:01:47.667
"I want to live in your dreams,
because I want to." - Fantastic.

01:01:49.626 --> 01:01:50.751
Really nice.

01:02:16.667 --> 01:02:18.042
Ladies and Gentlemen.

01:02:18.334 --> 01:02:21.876
Welcome to the Indian Music Awards.

01:02:23.584 --> 01:02:24.584
Finally!

01:02:24.876 --> 01:02:27.917
Uncle. Where's Rahul?
- We're waiting for you.

01:02:29.251 --> 01:02:30.709
When you can't
find Rahul anywhere..

01:02:30.792 --> 01:02:32.626
...you must always check the bar.

01:02:33.376 --> 01:02:36.709
But, it's such a big day
of my life, he should be with me.

01:02:36.792 --> 01:02:38.126
I've been nominated.

01:02:38.209 --> 01:02:39.209
I understand..

01:02:39.417 --> 01:02:40.626
Mom and dad are here.

01:02:40.709 --> 01:02:41.751
<i>I'll</i> just..

01:02:42.042 --> 01:02:44.709
Come. Please come.

01:02:47.001 --> 01:02:49.084
Come on, he'll be here. Come on.

01:02:49.459 --> 01:02:51.459
Please.

01:02:52.667 --> 01:02:54.709
Aarohi! Aarohi!

01:02:57.792 --> 01:02:58.792
Come here.

01:03:00.626 --> 01:03:02.042
Looking for me?

01:03:02.709 --> 01:03:03.917
You scared me.

01:03:04.584 --> 01:03:06.126
Where were you? - Forget that.

01:03:06.209 --> 01:03:07.626
How do you feel?

01:03:08.001 --> 01:03:09.126
It's useless.

01:03:11.501 --> 01:03:13.876
Wonder where you
keep disappearing to?

01:03:15.126 --> 01:03:16.501
I was at the bar.

01:03:17.126 --> 01:03:20.667
If you drink so much, how
will you recognize me in the crowd?

01:03:21.167 --> 01:03:22.167
I will.

01:03:23.917 --> 01:03:28.042
Amongst,
thousands, million, billions.

01:03:29.792 --> 01:03:33.667
I can forget myself, but not you.

01:03:38.626 --> 01:03:40.251
When did you fall so
deeply in love with me?

01:03:40.501 --> 01:03:41.376
Hi, ma'am!

01:03:41.459 --> 01:03:42.792
I'm from CNTV Live.

01:03:42.959 --> 01:03:44.792
Do you mind if I
take a small interview?

01:03:45.542 --> 01:03:46.876
Please. Just for five minutes.

01:03:47.001 --> 01:03:49.542
No, right now I.. - Just a second.

01:03:50.042 --> 01:03:51.251
Never do that.

01:03:51.792 --> 01:03:53.084
Okay. Never do that.

01:03:54.917 --> 01:03:58.126
Go. Time to touch the moon.

01:03:59.834 --> 01:04:00.917
Go get them.

01:04:08.001 --> 01:04:10.917
Ladies and Gentlemen.
Moving on the next award.

01:04:11.584 --> 01:04:13.917
Nidhi Chaudhary for "Aa jara"

01:04:15.584 --> 01:04:16.876
Listen. - Yes, sir.

01:04:17.417 --> 01:04:19.167
Did you get the bottle from home?
- No, sir.

01:04:19.292 --> 01:04:20.709
Then, why are you being a miser?
Pour some more.

01:04:20.792 --> 01:04:21.876
Sorry, sir.

01:04:24.917 --> 01:04:26.542
And award goes to..

01:04:27.792 --> 01:04:29.834
Aarohi Keshav Shirke.

01:04:43.834 --> 01:04:44.834
She won!

01:04:46.084 --> 01:04:47.084
Thank you.

01:04:48.626 --> 01:04:49.959
The girl sings well.

01:04:50.292 --> 01:04:51.292
She's very good.

01:04:51.376 --> 01:04:53.376
I heard she was offered
to sing in films too.

01:04:53.626 --> 01:04:54.917
But she refused.

01:04:55.417 --> 01:04:56.501
She'll say yes.

01:04:56.584 --> 01:04:58.417
Everyone wants to be a star.

01:05:01.792 --> 01:05:04.459
Of course, she will be.

01:05:04.709 --> 01:05:07.709
But, not a star, a maid.

01:05:09.126 --> 01:05:12.001
What's that singer's name?
That star.

01:05:12.084 --> 01:05:13.251
Rahul.

01:05:14.376 --> 01:05:16.376
She'll be his maid.

01:05:17.001 --> 01:05:18.751
And later, his nurse.

01:05:19.501 --> 01:05:21.417
Come on. He loves her.

01:05:22.084 --> 01:05:23.334
He's made her.

01:05:23.667 --> 01:05:26.876
She made it this
far because of him.

01:05:26.959 --> 01:05:29.334
That's what I am
trying to tell you.

01:05:29.834 --> 01:05:33.501
The higher she climbs
the ladder of success..

01:05:33.876 --> 01:05:36.376
...the lower she'll
fall because of Rahul.

01:05:36.792 --> 01:05:39.292
She belongs to a poor family,
after all.

01:05:40.667 --> 01:05:42.959
That's why RJ's taken her in.

01:05:43.417 --> 01:05:46.167
So that he can make her serve him.

01:05:46.792 --> 01:05:50.334
Keep her awake all night,
for his entertainment.

01:05:51.001 --> 01:05:54.501
To vent out the
anger of his failure.

01:05:55.251 --> 01:06:00.709
And as days will go by,
he will start hitting her.

01:06:01.876 --> 01:06:04.626
He'll beat her every day,
humiliate her.

01:06:06.209 --> 01:06:08.251
And once he falls sick..

01:06:08.876 --> 01:06:11.917
...she'll be cleaning his pukes.

01:06:13.292 --> 01:06:14.501
Remember this.

01:06:15.709 --> 01:06:17.834
Often, those who light the lamp..

01:06:18.167 --> 01:06:19.959
...are the ones that douse it later.

01:06:22.001 --> 01:06:26.042
There have been many
such stories in the industry.

01:06:26.459 --> 01:06:28.209
Another glass of whiskey.

01:06:52.376 --> 01:06:53.376
Rahul!

01:06:53.751 --> 01:06:54.751
Rahul!

01:07:05.084 --> 01:07:06.084
Rahul!

01:07:58.334 --> 01:08:01.126
Rahul. What are you doing?
Get down.

01:08:06.876 --> 01:08:09.126
Finally, you touched the moon.

01:08:10.876 --> 01:08:14.417
You were looking very beautiful
on the big screen with the award.

01:08:16.209 --> 01:08:20.417
Does this bottle
look nice in my hands?

01:08:28.959 --> 01:08:30.001
It doesn't.

01:08:33.709 --> 01:08:35.126
But what to do.

01:08:36.459 --> 01:08:38.834
I just can't let go.

01:08:46.251 --> 01:08:50.001
Rahul. - No, no, wait.

01:08:51.209 --> 01:08:53.667
After I got my first
break without any struggle..

01:08:55.667 --> 01:08:59.709
...I got fame, fortune, status.

01:09:01.834 --> 01:09:05.042
The world was at my feet.

01:09:05.876 --> 01:09:07.417
But, I didn't know what to do.

01:09:09.001 --> 01:09:10.667
I couldn't handle the fame..

01:09:12.459 --> 01:09:13.709
...or my senses.

01:09:14.626 --> 01:09:16.376
That was the condition yesterday..

01:09:16.959 --> 01:09:18.834
...It's still the same today.

01:09:19.209 --> 01:09:20.667
And it'll always stay that way.

01:09:20.792 --> 01:09:23.292
Rahul. What are you doing?

01:09:24.834 --> 01:09:26.251
What are you doing?

01:09:26.334 --> 01:09:27.792
Why are you doing this?

01:09:31.042 --> 01:09:33.167
We'll have to end
this relation here.

01:09:35.709 --> 01:09:36.709
Now.

01:09:38.376 --> 01:09:39.751
Nothing's lost yet.

01:09:41.751 --> 01:09:43.459
We aren't so close.

01:09:44.251 --> 01:09:46.042
We can live without each other.

01:09:47.459 --> 01:09:49.042
You're successful now, Aarohi.

01:09:51.167 --> 01:09:52.917
You've everything.

01:09:54.417 --> 01:09:56.292
Go, live your life.

01:09:57.709 --> 01:09:59.167
My habits have scared me.

01:10:02.126 --> 01:10:04.209
I don't know my future.

01:10:05.584 --> 01:10:08.959
What I might turn into.

01:10:09.876 --> 01:10:11.792
How I may treat you.

01:10:13.042 --> 01:10:16.042
It doesn't take long for
one to turn into the devil.

01:10:17.876 --> 01:10:20.001
So, why should I hold you back?

01:10:23.084 --> 01:10:24.376
I can't do this.

01:10:39.834 --> 01:10:42.334
Then.. then..

01:10:43.792 --> 01:10:45.167
Leave this habit.

01:10:46.084 --> 01:10:47.084
Leave it.

01:10:48.292 --> 01:10:49.459
It's no good.

01:10:50.459 --> 01:10:52.001
I'll help you.

01:10:52.209 --> 01:10:53.584
I'll help you leave it.

01:10:53.834 --> 01:10:56.001
Just give me a chance..
- I can never leave it.

01:10:57.501 --> 01:11:01.584
It's like a wife,
that won't ever leave me alone.

01:11:02.959 --> 01:11:04.459
So, listen to me.

01:11:04.876 --> 01:11:06.542
You'll be happier without me.

01:11:08.334 --> 01:11:13.001
That means, you can live
with this habit, but not me.

01:11:15.834 --> 01:11:16.834
Rahul.

01:11:17.251 --> 01:11:20.667
Love is not a joke.
- But my life is.

01:11:22.751 --> 01:11:25.667
But, you always had this habit.

01:11:28.042 --> 01:11:32.042
If you were so scared,
why did you come so close?

01:11:33.459 --> 01:11:35.417
You should've stayed away.
- Exactly.

01:11:36.626 --> 01:11:38.501
Until now, I was my own enemy!

01:11:38.959 --> 01:11:41.626
And before I become a
threat to you, just go away!

01:11:47.126 --> 01:11:48.126
Fine.

01:11:50.126 --> 01:11:51.626
I am going.

01:11:52.959 --> 01:11:56.542
Away, from you and this success.

01:11:57.792 --> 01:12:00.667
Don't misjudge your success.

01:12:02.084 --> 01:12:04.376
Only a few fortune people get it.

01:12:05.251 --> 01:12:06.251
I know.

01:12:07.292 --> 01:12:10.876
And also that,
you were with me in my bad times.

01:12:11.917 --> 01:12:13.834
But if you're not with
me in my good times..

01:12:14.501 --> 01:12:16.126
...then I don't want it.

01:12:36.042 --> 01:12:37.042
Aarohi!

01:12:37.542 --> 01:12:39.459
Aarohi! Aarohi!

01:12:40.042 --> 01:12:41.501
Aarohi, listen!

01:12:45.584 --> 01:12:50.584
"I can't live without you."

01:12:50.751 --> 01:12:55.626
"I don't exist without you."

01:13:00.792 --> 01:13:05.917
"I can't live without you."

01:13:06.042 --> 01:13:10.751
"I don't exist without you."

01:13:11.084 --> 01:13:21.417
"if I separate from you,
I'll lose myself."

01:13:23.459 --> 01:13:28.251
"Because it's you.. it's you."

01:13:28.834 --> 01:13:33.709
"You're my life."

01:13:34.084 --> 01:13:38.501
"My relief, my pain."

01:13:38.792 --> 01:13:44.251
"You're my love."

01:14:04.792 --> 01:14:14.626
"We can't stay away a moment."

01:14:14.959 --> 01:14:19.792
"I live only for you."

01:14:20.042 --> 01:14:24.542
"All my time is devoted to you."

01:14:24.709 --> 01:14:29.459
"I can't live a
moment without you."

01:14:29.792 --> 01:14:36.751
"Each breath's just for you."

01:14:37.542 --> 01:14:42.459
"Because it's you.. it's you."

01:14:42.876 --> 01:14:48.042
"You're my life."

01:14:48.126 --> 01:14:52.501
"My relief, my pain."

01:14:52.834 --> 01:14:57.667
"You're my love."

01:15:07.584 --> 01:15:09.459
Uncle one second wait uncle.

01:15:14.459 --> 01:15:17.042
Yes uncle don't worry.

01:15:17.542 --> 01:15:19.459
Aarohi! - Yes, mom.

01:15:21.292 --> 01:15:27.001
Dear, you're getting in
a live-in relation with him.

01:15:27.876 --> 01:15:30.417
Without marriage?

01:15:32.126 --> 01:15:35.959
What's the world going to say?

01:15:38.376 --> 01:15:41.501
This is my world..

01:15:44.167 --> 01:15:45.959
...that's it.

01:16:01.542 --> 01:16:06.459
"I lived only for you."

01:16:06.542 --> 01:16:11.751
"I've surrendered myself."

01:16:11.834 --> 01:16:16.501
"Your loyalty supported me."

01:16:16.792 --> 01:16:22.126
"it cured all my pain."

01:16:22.334 --> 01:16:27.251
"My destiny's tied with you."

01:16:27.584 --> 01:16:32.292
"You made me complete."

01:16:35.251 --> 01:16:40.167
"Because it's you.. it's you."

01:16:40.584 --> 01:16:45.709
"You're my life."

01:16:45.917 --> 01:16:50.251
"My relief, my pain."

01:16:50.584 --> 01:16:55.459
"You're my love."

01:16:55.709 --> 01:17:00.501
"Because it's you.. it's you."

01:17:01.167 --> 01:17:05.667
"You're my life."

01:17:06.292 --> 01:17:10.376
"My relief, my pain."

01:17:11.042 --> 01:17:15.876
"You're my love."

01:17:30.876 --> 01:17:31.876
Sir.

01:17:33.042 --> 01:17:35.126
Sir, Vivek's here to see you.

01:17:36.292 --> 01:17:37.876
He has won our heart.

01:17:38.376 --> 01:17:40.417
And today for his new song..

01:17:40.542 --> 01:17:43.626
...'YARA' he is going to be
honored with the national award.

01:17:44.042 --> 01:17:47.584
Now Aarohi's name will
be written in history.

01:17:55.501 --> 01:17:56.501
Hi.

01:18:00.667 --> 01:18:02.292
I came to apologize.

01:18:07.709 --> 01:18:09.501
What I did..

01:18:11.251 --> 01:18:13.626
I shouldn't have done..
- Forget it.

01:18:15.376 --> 01:18:16.376
Forget it.

01:18:18.292 --> 01:18:21.126
I thought you would still
be angry.. - Forget it.

01:18:22.209 --> 01:18:23.084
What will you drink?

01:18:23.167 --> 01:18:25.917
Enough. Stop. What are you doing?

01:18:34.459 --> 01:18:35.876
Is there any work?

01:18:39.417 --> 01:18:40.417
What?

01:18:40.667 --> 01:18:41.751
I want to work.

01:18:41.959 --> 01:18:43.167
I am not alone.

01:18:43.792 --> 01:18:44.792
There is.

01:18:46.417 --> 01:18:48.709
There's a small-time producer.

01:18:49.292 --> 01:18:50.709
They want to record a song.

01:18:51.126 --> 01:18:53.542
Will you sing for them? - So what?

01:18:54.584 --> 01:18:56.417
Music can't be compared with money.

01:19:01.167 --> 01:19:02.334
This is just good.

01:19:03.501 --> 01:19:04.709
Let's do this.

01:19:04.959 --> 01:19:05.959
Let's just do this.

01:19:06.042 --> 01:19:10.334
You know what, you're back.

01:19:10.501 --> 01:19:12.834
You're back my friend.
You're back.

01:19:18.001 --> 01:19:22.501
"It's not easy to be in love."

01:19:22.709 --> 01:19:27.126
"To shed tears."

01:19:27.459 --> 01:19:32.042
"Lovers are always
struck with grief."

01:19:32.167 --> 01:19:36.459
"Not everyone's blessed with this
boon." - Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop!

01:19:37.542 --> 01:19:39.376
Sir, the pitch is going flat.
Please up it a little.

01:19:40.292 --> 01:19:41.542
One more. - Yes.

01:19:41.626 --> 01:19:42.626
Come on.

01:19:46.167 --> 01:19:50.751
"It's not easy to be in love."

01:19:50.917 --> 01:19:53.501
"To shed tears." - Stop!
Stop! Stop!

01:19:53.917 --> 01:19:55.251
Sir, again pitch problem, sir.

01:19:55.417 --> 01:19:57.542
One more. - Okay.

01:19:57.834 --> 01:19:59.084
Yeah. One more.

01:20:05.251 --> 01:20:08.542
"It's not easy.." - Stop.

01:20:08.626 --> 01:20:12.251
Do you want me to down it a little?
- No, no need.

01:20:12.584 --> 01:20:14.292
Let's try again. - Yeah.

01:20:15.626 --> 01:20:18.334
My voice.. One more.

01:20:18.751 --> 01:20:19.751
Come on.

01:20:28.251 --> 01:20:29.417
What's wrong?

01:20:32.292 --> 01:20:33.667
Think it's funny?

01:20:34.667 --> 01:20:35.834
Can you sing this song?

01:20:37.917 --> 01:20:40.376
Can you?
Then sing it. - Sir..

01:20:40.459 --> 01:20:43.084
Sing it..
- Sorry, sir. it.. Wasn't for you..

01:20:43.167 --> 01:20:45.834
The tune's so strange, and you..

01:20:48.626 --> 01:20:49.876
I need a break.

01:20:50.709 --> 01:20:51.709
Sorry.

01:21:02.334 --> 01:21:03.834
Rahul, I won't spare them.

01:21:04.459 --> 01:21:06.376
I swear they won't
know what came their way.

01:21:07.209 --> 01:21:08.751
Who do they think they are?

01:21:09.917 --> 01:21:11.167
Let's go inside.

01:21:11.584 --> 01:21:12.876
Come on, I'll show them.

01:21:12.959 --> 01:21:14.042
Come on.

01:21:18.876 --> 01:21:20.292
I've lost my voice.

01:21:22.542 --> 01:21:23.876
I couldn't sing.

01:21:28.084 --> 01:21:30.001
My vocal chords are fried.

01:21:32.751 --> 01:21:33.959
That's not true.

01:21:35.501 --> 01:21:36.501
It's okay.

01:21:38.042 --> 01:21:39.417
It happens.

01:21:40.792 --> 01:21:42.126
Let's try again. - I am finished.

01:21:42.292 --> 01:21:53.459
"You.. leave me.."

01:21:54.917 --> 01:22:04.542
"That can never happen..

01:22:05.417 --> 01:22:10.001
...beloved."

01:22:14.584 --> 01:22:15.876
He's back again.

01:22:19.751 --> 01:22:22.917
These stars look
so ugly after they flop.

01:22:24.209 --> 01:22:30.417
"I always mention about you."

01:22:34.417 --> 01:22:40.709
"I'm always concerned about you."

01:22:44.626 --> 01:22:51.959
"I am what you are."

01:22:54.876 --> 01:23:02.959
"You're the one that
gave me my style."

01:23:04.042 --> 01:23:09.042
"Because it's you.. it's you."

01:23:09.584 --> 01:23:14.709
"You're my life."

01:23:14.792 --> 01:23:19.042
"My relief, my pain."

01:23:19.417 --> 01:23:24.292
"You're my love."

01:23:24.917 --> 01:23:29.167
"it's you.. it's you."

01:23:30.001 --> 01:23:35.001
"You're my pain, you're my cure."

01:23:35.292 --> 01:23:39.542
"My relief, my pain."

01:23:39.834 --> 01:23:45.209
"You're my love."

01:24:16.459 --> 01:24:17.876
Sorry.

01:24:19.042 --> 01:24:21.459
I tried,
but I couldn't come earlier.

01:24:25.292 --> 01:24:26.709
How was the recording?

01:24:27.751 --> 01:24:29.084
Nothing happened?

01:24:29.917 --> 01:24:32.876
So, what did you do today?
- Nothing.

01:24:33.292 --> 01:24:34.292
I was listening to my songs.

01:24:34.376 --> 01:24:35.709
Trying to sing-

01:24:36.292 --> 01:24:37.667
You don't get them these days.

01:24:38.709 --> 01:24:39.709
You will.

01:24:40.209 --> 01:24:42.417
I will pray for you.

01:24:43.042 --> 01:24:43.959
You can do that later.

01:24:44.042 --> 01:24:46.209
But first, did you eat or..

01:24:46.334 --> 01:24:48.292
...were you singing
on an empty stomach?

01:24:56.959 --> 01:24:58.292
I am very hungry.

01:25:00.042 --> 01:25:01.584
Let's go out.

01:25:01.834 --> 01:25:03.834
Let's stay here. I've ordered food.

01:25:03.959 --> 01:25:04.959
It'll be here soon.

01:25:05.917 --> 01:25:08.167
Aarohi,
there were few calls for you.

01:25:08.876 --> 01:25:10.084
Sehgal uncle called.

01:25:10.292 --> 01:25:12.209
He spoke to someone for you.

01:25:13.084 --> 01:25:15.334
There was a call
from a talent show.

01:25:15.709 --> 01:25:17.251
For a judging job, or something..

01:25:17.334 --> 01:25:19.709
And from a magazine as well.
For an interview.

01:25:19.834 --> 01:25:22.084
I asked him to call tomorrow.

01:25:22.542 --> 01:25:24.001
Rahul. - Yes.

01:25:24.834 --> 01:25:25.876
Look at me.

01:25:41.292 --> 01:25:42.876
Has anything changed?

01:25:52.667 --> 01:25:54.709
Nothing's changed?

01:25:56.417 --> 01:25:57.417
Come here.

01:26:05.667 --> 01:26:06.667
Food.

01:26:10.376 --> 01:26:11.959
How much? - How much? - 1560.

01:26:12.792 --> 01:26:14.042
I got it. I got it.

01:26:14.709 --> 01:26:16.209
How much? - 1560.

01:26:18.667 --> 01:26:20.751
1560.

01:26:22.251 --> 01:26:23.376
Keep the change. Thank you.

01:26:23.667 --> 01:26:25.584
Can I get an autograph? - Yes.

01:26:27.917 --> 01:26:29.001
Not yours, madam's.

01:26:37.792 --> 01:26:39.001
I'll call her.

01:26:48.542 --> 01:26:50.792
Aarohi, he wants your autograph.

Now. I'll give it later.

01:26:57.459 --> 01:26:59.001
These moments are priceless.

01:27:00.542 --> 01:27:02.126
They don't come back.

01:27:02.876 --> 01:27:03.876
Go.

01:27:04.834 --> 01:27:06.001

I've struck a deal
for your house as well.

01:28:08.376 --> 01:28:12.334
It's a penthouse,
so it'll sell easily.

01:28:13.792 --> 01:28:14.917
It'll take some time.

01:28:16.001 --> 01:28:17.959

You're always hovering around me.

01:36:50.876 --> 01:36:52.126
What am I doing? Why am I doing it?

01:36:52.209 --> 01:36:54.376
Am I asleep? Am I awake?
- Rahul, what are you doing?

01:36:54.459 --> 01:36:56.417
I'm fed up of this.

01:36:56.751 --> 01:36:58.417
I was better-off before. - Rahul.

01:36:58.584 --> 01:37:00.209
I was happier alone.
- Listen to me.

01:37:00.334 --> 01:37:02.209
I feel suffocated
since you came here.

01:37:02.292 --> 01:37:04.251
What are you doing, Rahul?
- Get lost.

01:37:04.501 --> 01:37:06.001
Go!
- Rahul, listen to me.

01:37:06.584 --> 01:37:07.667
Just go away!

01:37:07.751 --> 01:37:09.292
Just go away!

01:37:16.626 --> 01:37:18.209
Rahul, open the door.

01:37:21.042 --> 01:37:22.042
Please.

01:37:32.001 --> 01:37:34.001
We all fall weak, Rahul.

01:37:36.209 --> 01:37:37.334
We're scared.

01:37:39.834 --> 01:37:40.834
I was too.

01:37:43.751 --> 01:37:46.584
I thought that was my life.

01:37:49.292 --> 01:37:51.042
Then, you came in my life.

01:37:56.292 --> 01:37:58.167
And changed everything.

01:38:01.334 --> 01:38:04.876
You cannot leave me alone
after giving me all this.

This is what you've
been waiting for.

01:38:23.792 --> 01:38:24.792
It's here.

01:38:26.459 --> 01:38:29.042
I am what you wanted to make me.

01:38:31.542 --> 01:38:37.626
At least,

01:38:40.376 --> 01:38:41.376

"Empty.. your eyes."

01:39:11.709 --> 01:39:21.084
"I wish you.. could fill my eyes."

01:39:21.167 --> 01:39:22.167
Help me.

01:39:22.584 --> 01:39:33.042
"I wish you.. could fill
my eyes." - Please help me.

01:39:33.084 --> 01:39:35.084
How can they disappear?
- I don't know.

01:39:35.209 --> 01:39:37.501
We've recordings lined up,
shows have been organized.

01:39:37.959 --> 01:39:39.126
Who is going to do it?

01:39:39.209 --> 01:39:42.001
Find out where they are. - Yes sir.

01:40:05.834 --> 01:40:11.084
"My beloved,
if you give me your pain."

01:40:11.459 --> 01:40:17.042
"I swear I'll get better."

01:40:21.959 --> 01:40:27.959
"My beloved,

01:40:44.542 --> 01:40:49.876

"I swear I'll get better."

01:42:30.501 --> 01:42:33.459
And now,
I'd like to invite on stage..

01:42:33.542 --> 01:42:37.376
...the one that's
captivated our hearts.

01:42:38.751 --> 01:42:43.334
I would like to call upon,
our favorite RJ.

01:42:43.417 --> 01:42:45.751
That is Rahul Jayekar.

01:42:45.959 --> 01:42:47.209
Clap!

01:42:47.584 --> 01:42:51.792

01:43:04.251 --> 01:43:09.792
"Whether in happiness, or grief."

01:43:09.876 --> 01:43:12.584
"The heart always
called out to you."

01:43:12.667 --> 01:43:15.334
"You made me, you shaped me up."

01:43:15.459 --> 01:43:20.959
"The world looks up to God,
but you're my support."

01:43:21.042 --> 01:43:24.167
"All I need is you."

01:43:26.542 --> 01:43:29.917
"No matter what it is."

01:43:32.126 --> 01:43:34.584
"All I need is you."

01:43:34.959 --> 01:43:37.459
"No matter what it is."

01:43:37.584 --> 01:43:42.667
"I'll do it for you.

01:43:43.042 --> 01:43:46.209
Lull" die."

01:43:48.917 --> 01:43:52.001

01:43:54.542 --> 01:44:00.001
"My beloved,

01:44:00.167 --> 01:44:05.626
"I swear I'll get better."

01:44:05.709 --> 01:44:10.917
"My beloved,
if you give me your pain."

01:44:11.292 --> 01:44:17.334
"I swear I'll get better."

01:44:32.626 --> 01:44:34.834
The recording studio
called yesterday.

01:44:36.292 --> 01:44:37.751
You didn't go for your recording.

01:44:40.626 --> 01:44:42.209
Rahul needs me, and..

01:44:44.001 --> 01:44:45.542
I want to look after him.

01:44:46.751 --> 01:44:49.876
If I stay busy,
who will look after him?

01:44:50.001 --> 01:44:51.501
He's going nowhere.

01:44:51.834 --> 01:44:54.417
You'll be at loss, because
you don't know what you have here.

01:44:55.042 --> 01:44:59.542
You can lose all this in a moment.

01:45:00.292 --> 01:45:02.084
I tried explaining it to him.

01:45:03.751 --> 01:45:05.709
I beg you.

01:45:05.792 --> 01:45:07.709
Don't test me.

01:45:23.292 --> 01:45:25.084
I'm tying you down, right?

01:45:29.834 --> 01:45:31.292
Don't do this, Aarohi.

01:45:32.001 --> 01:45:33.834
Don't miss your schedules.

01:45:50.209 --> 01:45:52.001
I'll stay here, with you.

01:45:55.001 --> 01:45:56.834
Otherwise you will be alone.

01:45:57.917 --> 01:45:59.667
You will do whatever you wish.

01:46:01.376 --> 01:46:03.376
I cannot take this risk.

01:46:05.334 --> 01:46:07.709
I won't break your trust this time.
- But, Rahul..

01:46:07.792 --> 01:46:10.001
And you won't waste
your life for me.

01:46:10.042 --> 01:46:12.917
But, Rahul I..
- Aarohi, your failure..

01:46:13.001 --> 01:46:14.876
...will be the biggest
defeat of my life.

01:46:20.542 --> 01:46:23.792
I cannot see you
go down the same lane.

01:46:25.042 --> 01:46:26.459
You'll never be Rahul Jayekar.

01:46:27.459 --> 01:46:28.751
Not even for me.

01:46:30.334 --> 01:46:31.417
Promise me.

01:46:40.751 --> 01:46:42.334
Best of luck. Do well.

01:46:44.251 --> 01:46:45.209
I am right here.

01:46:45.292 --> 01:46:46.542
It's here just for you.

01:46:48.209 --> 01:46:49.917
Ma'am we ready for you.

01:46:50.626 --> 01:46:52.709
Lovely Aarohi Shirke.

01:46:53.251 --> 01:46:54.584
Okay-

01:47:00.626 --> 01:47:01.626
Who's he?

01:47:03.459 --> 01:47:04.584
Yes I will come.

01:47:08.167 --> 01:47:09.167
See you.

01:47:16.834 --> 01:47:18.042
Rahul Jayekar.

01:47:23.626 --> 01:47:26.167
What's up, buddy? - Nothing much.

01:47:27.167 --> 01:47:28.292
How are you?

01:47:30.001 --> 01:47:31.001
Rocking.

01:47:32.584 --> 01:47:33.959
What are you doing here?

01:47:35.626 --> 01:47:37.001
Watching the show.

01:47:38.959 --> 01:47:40.126
Good to see you.

01:47:40.417 --> 01:47:42.501
You're doing well. - Yeah.

01:47:56.792 --> 01:47:57.792
Rahul!

01:48:01.459 --> 01:48:02.959
Sorry. Beer?

01:48:11.251 --> 01:48:12.751
No, thanks. - Sure?

01:48:18.584 --> 01:48:20.042
Yeah. Quit!

01:48:22.876 --> 01:48:24.126
Pass me a diet coke.

01:48:28.167 --> 01:48:29.292
Diet coke, huh!

01:48:32.667 --> 01:48:33.667
Cheers.

01:48:34.667 --> 01:48:35.667
Cheers.

01:48:43.876 --> 01:48:44.876
Mr. Rahul.

01:48:46.084 --> 01:48:48.917
Kunal Basu, I'm a journalist.

01:48:50.084 --> 01:48:51.042
Okay-

01:48:51.126 --> 01:48:52.959
I want an interview.

01:48:54.417 --> 01:48:55.917
Exclusive interview.

01:48:57.584 --> 01:49:01.292
About your personal life,
etcetera, etcetera.

01:49:01.792 --> 01:49:03.792
Sorry, but I'm no
longer famous enough..

01:49:03.876 --> 01:49:05.709
...for people to read about my life.

01:49:06.501 --> 01:49:07.334
They know it all.

01:49:07.417 --> 01:49:08.959
Not about your love-life.

01:49:10.042 --> 01:49:12.959
I mean, the thing between
you and Ms. Aarohi.

01:49:13.209 --> 01:49:15.376
Few people know about it.

01:49:16.167 --> 01:49:18.292
I don't want to talk
about me and Aarohi.

01:49:20.292 --> 01:49:21.876
You don't understand.

01:49:23.876 --> 01:49:28.209
Aarohi's fans want to know
when she's getting married.

01:49:28.917 --> 01:49:31.292
I told you this is
my personal matter..

01:49:31.376 --> 01:49:33.251
...and I don't want
to talk about it.

01:49:33.459 --> 01:49:36.209
Your personal life's
public property as well.

01:49:37.292 --> 01:49:38.626
No, it's not.

01:49:39.459 --> 01:49:40.459
Thank you.

01:49:45.459 --> 01:49:46.459
Mr. Rahul.

01:49:47.084 --> 01:49:51.417
You don't know what
people say about you two.

01:49:51.917 --> 01:49:53.334
That's nothing new.

01:49:53.709 --> 01:49:58.251
People also say that,
Aarohi used to sing in beer bars.

01:49:58.626 --> 01:50:02.792
And you supported her
just to have some fun.

01:50:03.917 --> 01:50:05.042
You used her.

01:50:07.001 --> 01:50:09.667
You made her your
concubine and left her.

01:50:11.126 --> 01:50:13.001
Who do you think you are?
- What are you doing?

01:50:13.042 --> 01:50:14.709
You dare hit a journalist.

01:50:14.834 --> 01:50:16.292
Who do you think you are?

01:50:16.376 --> 01:50:18.584
You ruined a girl's life.

01:50:18.751 --> 01:50:20.667
You sleep with that girl.

01:50:20.751 --> 01:50:23.751
You stay with her,
but you can't admit it.

01:50:24.001 --> 01:50:26.334
I'll have you arrested. Wait.

01:50:26.501 --> 01:50:27.542
You rascal.

01:51:43.334 --> 01:51:47.167
9870541084.

01:51:47.417 --> 01:51:49.126
Yes, that's my number.

01:51:49.542 --> 01:51:50.751
Save it. Okay.

01:51:56.959 --> 01:51:59.751
We're here for him.

01:52:00.167 --> 01:52:01.167
Him.

01:52:02.459 --> 01:52:03.584
Not possible.

01:52:04.459 --> 01:52:05.501
What a man.

01:52:07.417 --> 01:52:09.334
He was drunk.
He created quite a scene.

01:52:09.501 --> 01:52:10.876
He beat-up a journalist.

01:52:12.292 --> 01:52:14.292
Then, he beat-up a taxi-driver.

01:52:15.417 --> 01:52:17.209
He smashed someone's car.

01:52:18.376 --> 01:52:19.667
That's not done.

01:52:20.667 --> 01:52:23.042
And what's the time now.

01:52:24.209 --> 01:52:25.709
You won't get bail now.

01:52:30.459 --> 01:52:33.626
I'll call Kamte.

01:52:35.084 --> 01:52:37.792
The court will open
at 11 am tomorrow.

01:52:37.876 --> 01:52:39.501
He'll be present
in the court first..

01:52:39.584 --> 01:52:42.001
...only then he can get bail.
He has to stay here tonight.

01:52:42.209 --> 01:52:43.209
Brother.

01:52:45.084 --> 01:52:48.959
Can I have a minute? - Sit.

01:52:51.917 --> 01:52:54.417
L.. - I know..

01:52:55.751 --> 01:52:58.209
You're Aarohi Shirke, right.

01:53:01.001 --> 01:53:02.001
Yes.

01:53:03.209 --> 01:53:04.334
Who's he?

01:53:04.667 --> 01:53:05.667
In.

01:53:08.001 --> 01:53:09.167
We're friends.

01:53:10.376 --> 01:53:12.167
We had a fight.

01:53:12.917 --> 01:53:15.042
I threatened to leave him.

01:53:15.209 --> 01:53:17.042
That got him worried and..

01:53:22.876 --> 01:53:23.917
Love story.

01:53:25.584 --> 01:53:26.584
Right?

01:53:30.876 --> 01:53:35.001
Please, you can keep this..

01:53:35.459 --> 01:53:37.459
What's this?
- And let him go. - No.

01:53:37.542 --> 01:53:40.959
And let him go. - What's this? No.

01:53:41.042 --> 01:53:46.334
It won't happen again.
I promise you, and..

01:53:49.709 --> 01:53:58.167
"It's you."

01:53:59.001 --> 01:54:06.251
"it's you."

01:54:39.667 --> 01:54:41.584
We'll go far away.

01:54:44.292 --> 01:54:46.251
Where no one knows us.

01:54:47.542 --> 01:54:54.334
I'll finish the contracts
that I signed, and leave.

01:54:55.917 --> 01:54:58.917
Without Rahul,
I don't want anything.

01:55:00.209 --> 01:55:04.042
I wanted to be successful..

01:55:04.084 --> 01:55:08.542
...but not at this price.

01:55:10.667 --> 01:55:12.334
Not by losing him.

01:55:15.751 --> 01:55:17.959
You don't fall sick
along with the patient.

01:55:20.167 --> 01:55:21.167
Dear.

01:55:22.834 --> 01:55:24.834
If your love was his cure..

01:55:26.501 --> 01:55:29.167
...then why didn't it work yet?

01:55:32.001 --> 01:55:34.084
He's dependent on his habits.

01:55:35.001 --> 01:55:36.001
His flaws.

01:55:38.001 --> 01:55:40.459
He doesn't want to get anywhere.

01:55:41.459 --> 01:55:44.542
So, where will you take him?

01:55:45.209 --> 01:55:46.209
Not me.

01:55:49.292 --> 01:55:53.376
He'll take me, in his world.

01:55:54.667 --> 01:55:56.417
The place where he
stays day and night.

01:55:56.876 --> 01:55:58.167
And he's happy-

01:55:59.167 --> 01:56:01.626
His habits will be mine.

01:56:02.792 --> 01:56:04.417
His flaws will be mine.

01:56:05.042 --> 01:56:06.876
He cannot leave them, but..

01:56:08.751 --> 01:56:10.376
I can take them up.

01:56:12.084 --> 01:56:17.042
If this poison is his first love,
then I'll accept it too.

01:56:19.126 --> 01:56:22.292
I'll stagger along with him.

01:56:29.917 --> 01:56:33.917
Then, I might find
him at some point.

01:56:35.751 --> 01:56:37.834
He might get fed up of his habits.

01:56:38.292 --> 01:56:42.917
He might come back and say "Aarohi,
I am tired".

01:56:45.751 --> 01:56:48.584
Then I'll say "Come..

01:56:50.417 --> 01:56:51.792
...let's go home."

01:56:53.876 --> 01:56:54.959
And, he'll come back.

01:56:56.584 --> 01:56:57.959
We'll come back, uncle.

01:57:02.501 --> 01:57:06.042
You've gone crazy.

01:57:07.084 --> 01:57:09.834
You don't know what you're saying.

01:58:20.167 --> 01:58:21.667
When did you get UP?

01:58:25.376 --> 01:58:26.834
You kept crying all night.

01:58:31.126 --> 01:58:32.751
My love's made you sad.

01:58:36.501 --> 01:58:41.459
I was crying,
because I was missing you.

01:58:41.876 --> 01:58:42.917
I am right here.

01:58:47.501 --> 01:58:48.626
Just like that.

01:58:55.126 --> 01:58:56.251
Come closer.

01:59:04.584 --> 01:59:06.292
I came here to tell you.

01:59:09.126 --> 01:59:10.792
You can cry all you want.

01:59:12.834 --> 01:59:14.626
Your days of crying are over.

01:59:15.042 --> 01:59:17.001
I'll leave everything, Aarohi.

01:59:18.167 --> 01:59:20.042
I'll turn over a new leaf for you.

01:59:20.501 --> 01:59:22.126
Everything will be fine.

01:59:22.376 --> 01:59:23.417
You and me.

01:59:25.209 --> 01:59:26.751
You'll help me, won't you?

01:59:32.376 --> 01:59:34.792
Have I ever said no? - No.

01:59:39.001 --> 01:59:41.292
The day I saw you first,
I realized..

01:59:42.751 --> 01:59:45.167
...why you came in my life.

01:59:46.251 --> 01:59:47.876
You've loved me a lot.

01:59:48.334 --> 01:59:50.084
Given me a lot of things.

01:59:50.292 --> 01:59:53.167
I gave you what was easy for me.

01:59:54.042 --> 01:59:57.834
You endured my difficulties,
my betrayal.

01:59:58.792 --> 02:00:00.834
Divided love.

02:00:03.584 --> 02:00:05.459
And I couldn't give
you your right place.

02:00:07.667 --> 02:00:09.167
But all that's going to change now.

02:00:09.417 --> 02:00:11.126
Right now. From this moment.

02:00:11.709 --> 02:00:13.959
Because Aarohi,
lam going to join a gym.

02:00:15.334 --> 02:00:17.251
That's going to
be my daily program.

02:00:17.667 --> 02:00:20.001
Gym in the morning,
jogging in the evening.

02:00:20.376 --> 02:00:22.001
Proper diet. Aarohi.

02:00:22.334 --> 02:00:23.334
Really?

02:00:23.542 --> 02:00:25.459
Will you really.. - Yes.

02:00:26.834 --> 02:00:28.126
This time I am serious, Aarohi.

02:00:28.209 --> 02:00:29.501
Like I never was.

02:00:31.667 --> 02:00:32.751
I am going.

02:00:33.501 --> 02:00:35.584
Keep the food ready,
and wait for me.

02:00:35.751 --> 02:00:36.751
Miss me.

02:00:37.501 --> 02:00:38.501
Rahul.

02:00:50.126 --> 02:00:52.584
I love you.

02:00:55.209 --> 02:00:56.792
Come on.

02:00:59.542 --> 02:01:00.959
I'll change all this.

02:01:11.126 --> 02:01:12.126
Aarohi.

02:01:13.042 --> 02:01:14.042
What?

02:01:16.292 --> 02:01:17.292
Nothing.

02:01:20.334 --> 02:01:21.626
Just like that.

02:01:22.167 --> 02:01:29.251
"Forget me.
This is my final goodbye."

02:01:29.459 --> 02:01:35.334
"You've to live on.. without me.

02:01:36.626 --> 02:01:43.584
"This is your journey, your path."

02:01:44.042 --> 02:01:49.917
"You've to live on.. without me.

02:01:51.042 --> 02:01:58.084
"I pray you attain fame."

02:01:58.334 --> 02:02:05.209
"I pray you're blessed
with all the grace."

02:02:05.751 --> 02:02:12.042
"You've to live on.. without me.

02:02:13.001 --> 02:02:19.917
"Forget me.
This is my final goodbye."

02:02:20.334 --> 02:02:26.584
"You've to live on.. without me.

02:02:28.542 --> 02:02:32.084
"You're my shore, my support."

02:02:32.167 --> 02:02:35.542
"You're the tune in my heart,
my saga."

02:02:35.792 --> 02:02:41.667
"Be your own God."

02:02:44.001 --> 02:02:47.167
"lam like evening that's fading."

02:02:47.626 --> 02:02:50.876
"You're the new dawn."

02:02:51.251 --> 02:02:57.126
"You've to live on.. without me.

02:02:58.542 --> 02:03:04.459
"You've to live on.. without me.

02:03:26.126 --> 02:03:28.667
Sir, one body found in water.

02:03:29.501 --> 02:03:32.167
And Ambulance will
come for take the body.

02:03:54.626 --> 02:03:56.334
Aarohi dear listen. - Aarohi.

02:03:56.459 --> 02:03:58.251
Aarohi where are you going?

02:03:58.376 --> 02:04:01.001
Aarohi dear listen. - Aarohi.

02:04:01.084 --> 02:04:04.417
Aarohi don't

02:04:04.542 --> 02:04:06.417
Aarohi - where are you going.

02:04:37.001 --> 02:04:38.001
Coward!

02:04:45.292 --> 02:04:46.292
Coward!

02:04:54.792 --> 02:04:55.792
Coward!

02:04:56.792 --> 02:04:59.834
Coward! Coward! Coward!

02:05:00.751 --> 02:05:01.751
Coward!

02:05:02.042 --> 02:05:03.167
Coward!

02:05:07.251 --> 02:05:11.292
"It's you."

02:05:16.626 --> 02:05:21.709
"it's you."

02:05:38.584 --> 02:05:39.917
Where are you going?

02:05:43.959 --> 02:05:44.959
Anywhere?

02:05:48.542 --> 02:05:49.417
What do you mean?

02:05:49.501 --> 02:05:50.834
I mean far away.

02:05:53.084 --> 02:05:54.459
I'm leaving everything.

02:05:55.126 --> 02:05:56.626
But, that's not what Rahul wanted?

02:05:58.251 --> 02:05:59.626
Rahul who?

02:06:00.251 --> 02:06:02.501
I don't know any
person by that name.

02:06:03.084 --> 02:06:07.292
Aarohi, decisions taken in a rage,
always hurt in the end.

02:06:08.959 --> 02:06:13.001
For the first time,
my decision hasn't hurt me.

02:06:13.751 --> 02:06:14.751
Good.

02:06:15.751 --> 02:06:16.751
Very good.

02:06:18.042 --> 02:06:19.042
Please go.

02:06:20.501 --> 02:06:22.042
He should fade away.

02:06:22.792 --> 02:06:24.417
Die inside you.

02:06:25.792 --> 02:06:27.251
He was worth that.

02:06:32.167 --> 02:06:34.001
I tried stopping him.

02:06:35.084 --> 02:06:36.542
But he didn't stop.

02:06:38.042 --> 02:06:39.042
He said..

02:06:40.459 --> 02:06:42.876
"This is it".

02:06:44.751 --> 02:06:48.459
He sold your art,
like your secretary.

02:06:50.001 --> 02:06:53.334
The little life that he had,
was just for you.

02:06:54.501 --> 02:06:57.084
But my friend died,
the day he hurt you.

02:06:59.626 --> 02:07:01.376
The day he raised his hand on you.

02:07:02.709 --> 02:07:04.459
The day he saw you
at the police station.

02:07:05.626 --> 02:07:06.626
He knew.

02:07:08.626 --> 02:07:10.959
Drinking was his weakness.

02:07:12.042 --> 02:07:13.834
He had become your weakness.

02:07:14.917 --> 02:07:17.167
The biggest obstruction
in your path.

02:07:20.667 --> 02:07:22.334
And so, he gave his life.

02:07:23.667 --> 02:07:25.042
So that you can live.

02:07:25.834 --> 02:07:28.042
So that,
you don't become another Jayekar.

02:07:28.584 --> 02:07:31.084
But you know what, he failed.

02:07:31.667 --> 02:07:32.959
My friend lost.

02:07:34.334 --> 02:07:36.876
You turned out to
be another Rahul Jayekar.

02:08:17.626 --> 02:08:23.209
"The place where
buds will blossom."

02:08:24.792 --> 02:08:30.709
"That's where you'll find me."

02:08:32.126 --> 02:08:37.834
"The place that'll
remind you of my loyalty."

02:08:39.501 --> 02:08:45.459
"That's where you'll find me."

02:08:46.709 --> 02:08:53.709
"I'll come see you, I promise you."

02:08:54.001 --> 02:09:01.209
"I'll always be with you,
I promise you."

02:09:01.501 --> 02:09:07.626
"You've to live on.. without me.

02:09:08.126 --> 02:09:10.417
Aarohi ma'am, I'm a big fan.

02:09:10.501 --> 02:09:12.167
Can I have your autograph, please?

02:09:26.709 --> 02:09:27.459
Thank you.

02:09:27.542 --> 02:09:29.417
Thank you, ma'am.
- Thank you so much.

02:09:30.001 --> 02:09:33.251
Wow! but Aarohi rahul Jayekar.

02:09:33.334 --> 02:09:35.834
Yeah rahul Jayekar that singer.

02:09:53.376 --> 02:09:58.126
"Because it's you.. it's you."

02:09:58.751 --> 02:10:03.792
"You're my life."

02:10:04.042 --> 02:10:08.417
"My relief, my pain."

02:10:08.667 --> 02:10:14.084
"You're my love."

02:10:24.417 --> 02:10:29.501
"You and I share a strange bond."

02:10:29.584 --> 02:10:34.292
"We can't stay away a moment."

02:10:34.667 --> 02:10:39.626
"I live only for you."

02:10:39.751 --> 02:10:44.209
"All my time is devoted to you."

02:10:44.334 --> 02:10:49.209
"I can't live a
moment without you."

02:10:49.459 --> 02:10:56.126
"Each breath's just for you."

02:10:57.251 --> 02:11:02.209
"Because it's you.. it's you."

02:11:02.626 --> 02:11:07.584
"You're my life."

02:11:07.834 --> 02:11:12.126
"My relief, my pain."

02:11:12.542 --> 02:11:17.709
"You're my love."

02:11:18.417 --> 02:11:25.292
"it's you."

02:11:27.626 --> 02:11:36.292
"it's you."

02:11:40.042 --> 02:11:45.126
"I lived only for you."

02:11:45.209 --> 02:11:50.251
"I've surrendered myself."

02:11:50.334 --> 02:11:55.167
"Your loyalty supported me."

02:11:55.376 --> 02:12:00.501
"it cured all my pain."

02:12:00.834 --> 02:12:05.792
"My destiny's tied with you."

02:12:06.126 --> 02:12:10.792
"You made me complete."

02:12:13.792 --> 02:12:18.792
"Because it's you.. it's you."

02:12:19.126 --> 02:12:24.334
"You're my life."

02:12:24.459 --> 02:12:28.876
"My relief, my pain."

02:12:29.167 --> 02:12:38.959
