06:47.000 --> 06:50.000
It's been a long time since we
have a visitor Brother Geraldus.

06:51.000 --> 06:53.000
Especially one who has
traveled as far as you.

06:54.000 --> 06:56.100
The authority of Rome knows
no distance Father Abbot.

06:58.000 --> 07:00.000
Not even to the ends of the earth.

07:01.000 --> 07:05.500
This cannot be. We receive no word.

07:06.000 --> 07:07.999
My apologies.

07:08.000 --> 07:10.000
Our holy father has many enemies

07:11.000 --> 07:14.000
Discretion was of the utmost important.
Second only to haste.

07:15.000 --> 07:16.200
You do not know what you ask.

07:17.000 --> 07:21.000
Father Abbot. Rome has spoken.
There is no debate.

07:25.000 --> 07:27.000
These are dark days for the faithful.

07:28.000 --> 07:31.000
Jerusalem has been lost for 20 years now.

07:38.540 --> 07:41.150
Our Holy Father
believes the relic keep here,

07:41.280 --> 07:45.560
has the power to separate
the faithful from the faithless.

07:45.690 --> 07:48.960
To summon the wrath
of God upon his enemies.

07:49.760 --> 07:54.570
A power that could insure
victory in the upcoming crusade.

07:54.690 --> 07:57.230
You cannot hide such power.

09:28.120 --> 09:31.800
You will see the safe delivery
for our holiest relic to Rome.

09:33.360 --> 09:34.570
Go with God.

12:40.050 --> 12:41.350
It has no mark on.

13:22.590 --> 13:24.400
They are afraid of it.

13:24.560 --> 13:26.760
Even before the lightning,
they would not go near it.

13:26.860 --> 13:28.670
Of course they were.

13:29.460 --> 13:32.240
They know what happen to
those who disturb the relic.

13:33.700 --> 13:36.980
Perhaps you are unfamiliar
with the stories, brother.

13:38.000 --> 13:40.380
Or else you would not be
so eager to remove it.

13:40.510 --> 13:41.540
Enlighten me.

13:44.040 --> 13:47.150
Before we have such a fine
gold box to keep it in,

13:47.980 --> 13:52.020
other foreigners tried to take it.
Norse men.

13:52.120 --> 13:55.030
They brought up bloody tide
to this shore for 200 years

13:55.150 --> 13:57.230
before they came to Kilmannán.

13:58.660 --> 14:03.070
The monks were sleeping. The lucky
ones would have died in their beds.

14:03.460 --> 14:06.240
But they were awoken by a strange sound.

14:07.930 --> 14:11.940
They ran out to the church and saw an angel
striking the relic as if it were a bell.

14:12.940 --> 14:14.180
The monks fled.

14:14.270 --> 14:17.580
When they returned, they saw
that a great storm has blown up.

14:18.880 --> 14:22.880
Every single Norse ship had been
dragged to the bottom of the sea,

14:23.020 --> 14:25.290
where their souls would know no rest.

14:27.420 --> 14:30.700
Just beside the relic where
the bodies of three Norse men,

14:31.260 --> 14:32.430
twisted and burned.

14:33.660 --> 14:37.510
No one but a pure of heart
can touch the relic and live.

14:39.200 --> 14:40.580
No one.

14:50.210 --> 14:51.750
How long has he served you?

14:53.850 --> 14:58.350
He's been with us 5 summers.
- He's not a monk.

14:58.450 --> 15:01.590
He respects what we carried
but he does not fear it.

15:01.720 --> 15:05.170
But he's just a mute. A halfway.

15:07.730 --> 15:09.400
He is not a halfway.

15:10.530 --> 15:12.810
Diarmuid found him washed
up on the shores...

15:13.770 --> 15:18.880
- in a carrier with no oars no food.
- In some lands that is a punishment.

15:20.370 --> 15:21.940
Perhaps he's atoning.

15:22.040 --> 15:26.580
He's obeyed every task asked of him,
no matter how difficult or dangerous.

15:27.380 --> 15:30.090
In all that time, he's never spoken.

15:31.580 --> 15:33.790
It is not our place to ask why.

15:35.350 --> 15:36.630
You should sleep.

17:49.920 --> 17:52.730
I did not know you spoke
my tongue, brother Ciarán.

17:53.490 --> 17:55.560
The abbot said you were far traveled.

17:56.330 --> 17:58.400
- You have seen Rome? - A long time ago.

17:59.360 --> 18:01.810
And the Holy Land? Jerusalem?

18:18.920 --> 18:22.520
He says that water is no good.
It runs through there.

18:23.590 --> 18:25.930
- What of it? - A place of the Sídhe.

18:26.760 --> 18:30.210
They say that Tuatha day DenAnn come
out at night to play among those rocks.

18:30.360 --> 18:33.610
They cast spells into the
water and bewitch travelers.

18:35.730 --> 18:37.010
You are afraid of this?

18:37.900 --> 18:40.710
You allow your course to be
determined by Pagan superstition?

18:40.810 --> 18:46.090
Geraldus, we should not tarry here.
- We are soldiers of Christ.

18:46.180 --> 18:48.750
Yet you would run from a mere scandalous?

18:53.790 --> 18:55.290
In the name of St. Matthias.

18:55.390 --> 18:58.960
Whose relic we are honored to
bring to the feet of the Holy Sea,

18:59.160 --> 19:01.700
I bless and purify this water.

19:04.960 --> 19:09.110
In the Name of the Father,
the Son and the Holy Spirit.

19:09.200 --> 19:12.010
I scatter the demons that are tainted it,

19:12.140 --> 19:17.350
and consent them to everlasting hell,
where they shall be bound in firing chains,

19:17.440 --> 19:20.860
and crush under the heel of God Almighty.

19:38.830 --> 19:39.870
Boy.

20:27.650 --> 20:29.060
What is that, boy?

20:34.420 --> 20:37.330
- It helps ward off.. - It soothes
the aching stomach, brother.

20:37.420 --> 20:40.370
- Will you try some of it?- I
have no stomachache, herbalist.

20:49.170 --> 20:51.170
You were to take us to
the Merville's border.

21:05.680 --> 21:06.750
Brothers...

22:12.380 --> 22:13.760
Geraldus.

22:18.060 --> 22:21.560
All I ask is for a little faith.
Is that so hard?

25:14.230 --> 25:16.840
I imagine when you joined the monastery,

25:18.600 --> 25:22.140
They did not tell you would be a pack mule.

25:22.240 --> 25:26.620
He's not a monk, my lord. He's
a converso, a lay brother.

25:30.350 --> 25:35.630
Some of my men think that they know you,

25:36.790 --> 25:38.200
but not from where.

25:44.100 --> 25:45.940
A crusade, was it?

25:47.230 --> 25:48.580
Venice?

25:50.640 --> 25:52.950
Constantinople?

25:56.610 --> 25:59.350
Perhaps you might settle the matter.

26:00.950 --> 26:04.520
There's a small wage on it. - He is a mute.

26:04.720 --> 26:08.220
He cannot speak. - Bit his tongue, did he?

26:11.520 --> 26:15.200
Deaf also? - He can hear you.

26:17.060 --> 26:18.840
But chooses not to.

30:04.460 --> 30:06.130
A pretty box.

30:06.220 --> 30:09.430
It is but a humble shell. Brother Ciarán?

30:13.230 --> 30:14.610
This is unwise.

30:19.770 --> 30:25.810
After Judas betrayed Christ, the
apostles cast lots to replace him.

30:26.710 --> 30:28.850
Matthias from Bethlehem was chosen.

30:29.480 --> 30:31.860
Beholding the death and
resurrection of our Lord,

30:32.020 --> 30:34.260
Matthias traveled North

30:34.390 --> 30:37.420
to spread the Gospel to the
barbarians of Cappadocia.

30:42.230 --> 30:45.440
There, he was martyred.

30:48.400 --> 30:52.850
When the stones of the pagans broke
his bones and spilled his blood.

30:53.000 --> 30:54.750
Matthias gave thanks.

30:54.840 --> 30:57.150
The rock that ended his earthly life

30:57.240 --> 30:59.980
caught fire and burned
the men who murdered him.

31:00.650 --> 31:05.560
They cried out for mercy, but the ground
opened up and hell swallowed them whole

31:05.650 --> 31:08.560
while the body of Matthias
was elevated to heaven.

31:11.190 --> 31:14.100
And this is that rock.

31:15.660 --> 31:17.500
Most impressive.

32:25.860 --> 32:29.310
You talk of having some kind
of agreement with these men.

32:30.470 --> 32:34.040
I would like to know the particulars.
- They do not concern you.

32:34.170 --> 32:38.620
As regards the sanctity of the
relic and the lives of my brothers,

32:38.780 --> 32:40.450
they're very much concern me.

32:40.550 --> 32:43.750
You are not blind to what
kind of men these are.

32:43.950 --> 32:46.520
Yet you entrust all to their protection.

32:47.220 --> 32:49.220
You were on crusade, brother.

32:50.860 --> 32:53.340
It cannot be so hard for you to guess.

32:55.760 --> 33:00.210
On the day of judgment, the worst of
men will have the greatest of fear.

33:00.330 --> 33:03.540
Unless someone can
intercede them their behalf.

33:09.270 --> 33:10.480
You mean to absolve them?

33:12.010 --> 33:15.690
A powerful man does not become
so weak on incurring sins.

33:17.250 --> 33:19.490
The Baron is not a young man.

33:19.580 --> 33:24.030
His mind has inevitably turned
to more spiritual matters.

33:24.760 --> 33:26.630
We are the only salvation.

33:27.360 --> 33:30.360
The blackest of their
deeds bind them to us.

33:30.460 --> 33:31.600
No.

33:33.100 --> 33:34.270
No.

33:36.530 --> 33:37.770
Not to us, no.

33:52.050 --> 33:53.120
Brother?

33:55.750 --> 33:58.260
Rua says that foreigners
know nothing but war.

34:00.960 --> 34:02.730
He says it's in their blood.

34:06.160 --> 34:08.270
That they are descendants of the Norse men.

34:10.400 --> 34:13.780
And they conquered France and
England, and will do the same here.

34:19.440 --> 34:22.250
But was there ever a truly
peace in this land, brother?

34:23.449 --> 34:25.659
Before the foreigners came.

34:29.590 --> 34:31.460
That was a long time ago, Diarmuid.

34:33.389 --> 34:34.800
I was just a boy.

34:35.989 --> 34:37.500
A little older than you.

34:42.630 --> 34:43.739
No.

34:46.600 --> 34:48.610
No, there was never peace.

34:51.409 --> 34:52.650
Not here.

34:53.909 --> 34:55.820
Not anywhere else in the world.

34:56.750 --> 34:58.420
Not since the fall.

35:02.450 --> 35:03.930
Why?

35:05.220 --> 35:07.830
Some say it's not the
natural way of things.

35:10.960 --> 35:14.810
Peace needs to be grown,
cared for, nurtured.

35:15.670 --> 35:17.040
And that..

35:20.400 --> 35:22.780
That is beyond the reach of most men.

36:24.040 --> 36:25.740
You're up early little monk.

36:27.540 --> 36:29.380
I always rise at this time.

36:31.940 --> 36:33.850
Or perhaps you are a spy.

36:35.050 --> 36:36.820
My Lord?

36:36.910 --> 36:41.800
Sneaking away to tell your king's men
about our route South. Is that it?

36:41.920 --> 36:44.420
No my lord... - No?

36:46.420 --> 36:48.100
Then why do you flee?

36:51.960 --> 36:53.370
I serve Christ.

36:53.500 --> 36:56.600
But you serve your clan first, no? - No.

36:59.140 --> 37:02.120
My father has always
impressed with bias men.

37:02.840 --> 37:05.910
Me? I have my doubts.

37:07.450 --> 37:09.860
Anyone can wear the robes of monk.

37:16.550 --> 37:17.590
You...

39:09.770 --> 39:11.970
Does something ail you, brother?

39:13.640 --> 39:14.780
No. It was nothing.

40:03.290 --> 40:04.790
Death!

44:55.810 --> 44:57.220
Don't touch it.

44:58.020 --> 44:59.360
Don't touch it.

44:59.450 --> 45:01.260
Stop.

48:37.670 --> 48:39.910
Where is the rock?

48:46.340 --> 48:48.520
Where is it? Where is the rock?

48:54.520 --> 48:56.120
We must retrieve it.

49:03.490 --> 49:04.840
Did you not hear the bell?

49:06.730 --> 49:09.040
Did you not witness the miracle?

49:11.200 --> 49:14.810
When those savages defiled rock of St.
Matthias,

49:14.940 --> 49:18.040
look how God rode an instrument of vengeance

49:18.140 --> 49:20.210
from the lowest of his servant.

49:27.950 --> 49:31.590
You are in the service of
the Church, are you not?

49:34.520 --> 49:38.130
"He who smote many nations
and slew many kings .."

49:41.430 --> 49:45.970
Come forth with an untroubled heart.
These are enemies of Christ

49:46.140 --> 49:49.020
and He rejoices with every one you destroy.

49:51.540 --> 49:53.650
Your work is not yet done.

50:01.690 --> 50:03.760
Such is true for all of us.

50:04.620 --> 50:06.100
What would you have us do?

50:06.990 --> 50:09.600
Our escorts are dead. Our
brothers are slaughter.

50:10.290 --> 50:14.900
We don't even know where they are.
- A cart, a prisoner.

50:16.800 --> 50:19.510
They will have left tracks, will they not?

50:19.640 --> 50:22.210
The young lord of Merville
said he will return.

50:22.370 --> 50:25.220
He has men, knights. We could wait for him.

50:26.210 --> 50:28.020
And if the others return first?

50:31.380 --> 50:33.190
It is our duty to try.

54:01.790 --> 54:03.130
They're so many.

54:03.360 --> 54:05.930
We can make a diversion. Draw them away.

54:06.260 --> 54:08.380
How far would we get with
the reliquary on our backs?

54:08.430 --> 54:10.380
We do not need the reliquary

54:12.770 --> 54:14.580
Only what's inside it.

54:16.670 --> 54:18.450
I will carry it.

54:18.540 --> 54:20.650
I will carry the relic.

54:24.650 --> 54:26.820
One of you will have to free Ciarán.

54:28.150 --> 54:30.690
No. We cannot risk the
recovery of the relic.

54:30.820 --> 54:32.200
Not for one man.

54:32.360 --> 54:35.460
How can you say such a thing?
Because this was the oath we took.

54:36.590 --> 54:38.600
These bodies. They are not our own.

54:38.760 --> 54:41.000
That the Lord's to do with as he sees fit.

54:41.800 --> 54:47.310
Or Brother Ciarán here insight of our eyes,
he would tell you the same thing.

54:49.640 --> 54:51.380
Even if he's alive.

54:51.510 --> 54:53.850
How long before they notice he was gone?

54:59.120 --> 55:00.560
We cannot leave him.

55:02.920 --> 55:04.420
We shall pray for his soul.

56:33.080 --> 56:34.420
What is he doing?

56:35.410 --> 56:37.520
Brother Ciarán.

56:39.880 --> 56:41.090
Diarmuid?

56:41.920 --> 56:43.960
Diarmuid?

56:44.690 --> 56:46.390
Brother, please be quiet.

56:47.320 --> 56:49.480
You have to save your strength
for when we run please.

56:49.990 --> 56:53.600
Wait.

57:49.320 --> 57:53.200
Diarmuid, listen to me. You must go.
You must leave. Now!

57:53.320 --> 57:57.240
I can not leave, not without
the rock, not without you.

57:58.160 --> 58:01.200
I hope the Lord will forgive me
but I threw it from the cart.

58:03.930 --> 58:08.610
What? Where? - On a clear Galanthus.

58:08.740 --> 58:13.920
The last place I saw you following.
You will find it near cart track.

58:14.510 --> 58:17.250
Take it and go East.

58:18.780 --> 58:22.560
Keep it safe and keep
yourself safe, Diarmuid.

58:46.210 --> 58:48.420
Go. Go.

59:09.700 --> 59:11.840
Where is the rock, brother?

59:15.310 --> 59:17.380
You vowed to protect us.

59:19.510 --> 59:20.720
And death.

59:22.180 --> 59:25.220
I have vowed to honor ..

59:26.320 --> 59:27.850
And obey my King.

59:33.660 --> 59:37.070
Your pope is quarreling with him.

59:38.260 --> 59:44.210
A relic such as yours would
be a powerful bargaining tool.

59:44.370 --> 59:48.470
Presumably you will be well rewarded.

59:49.540 --> 59:53.750
The King is not happy with our power that
some of his subjects here have become.

59:54.880 --> 59:58.590
He thinks they are too friendly
with their cousins ​​in Normandy.

01:00:00.450 --> 01:00:04.420
A wise man would do well
to prove his loyalty.

01:00:05.760 --> 01:00:07.260
And in doing so,

01:00:09.460 --> 01:00:13.000
you would betray your own
father's chance to salvation.

01:00:16.900 --> 01:00:20.440
My father is a coward.

01:00:22.770 --> 01:00:24.220
Dying.

01:00:24.310 --> 01:00:30.310
He would rather Crawford to the church
than safeguard the future of his family.

01:00:32.320 --> 01:00:34.090
Where is the relic?

01:00:38.250 --> 01:00:42.730
Brother, sooner or later it
will make its way to Rome.

01:00:44.230 --> 01:00:48.070
What difference if it spends
a year or so with the king?

01:00:51.930 --> 01:00:53.780
I do not know where it is.

01:00:57.140 --> 01:00:58.550
You're lying.

01:01:00.080 --> 01:01:01.580
Badly.

01:01:03.880 --> 01:01:06.590
I expected better from the man of the God.

01:01:14.390 --> 01:01:20.400
I've got this ...from a
priest in Constantinople.

01:01:22.430 --> 01:01:24.110
A strange man.

01:01:25.670 --> 01:01:26.980
He used it to...

01:01:28.640 --> 01:01:30.640
persuade the Greeks...

01:01:30.810 --> 01:01:34.580
to tell us where they had hidden
all of the gold from the churches.

01:01:38.150 --> 01:01:39.850
I never saw it failed.

01:01:58.000 --> 01:01:59.980
Your last chance.

01:02:04.870 --> 01:02:05.940
Where?

01:02:10.810 --> 01:02:12.290
Do you feel that?

01:02:15.750 --> 01:02:17.490
Those are your entrance.

01:02:18.090 --> 01:02:22.900
Twisted around the arrow,
like worms on a hook.

01:02:24.190 --> 01:02:25.970
Would you like to see them?

01:02:40.710 --> 01:02:43.420
You have suffered enough, brother.

01:02:45.010 --> 01:02:49.590
I can give you a quick death.
A merciful death.

01:02:50.790 --> 01:02:55.000
Just tell me where is the relic.

01:03:18.410 --> 01:03:22.950
You will die in agonizing
death, and for what?

01:03:23.050 --> 01:03:27.190
Even if we don't find the
relic, another stone will do.

01:03:28.420 --> 01:03:31.030
I will put in a pretty box
and people will accept it.

01:03:32.160 --> 01:03:35.670
Even the king or the Pope.

01:03:36.730 --> 01:03:40.910
Think about it.

01:04:15.640 --> 01:04:16.670
Here.

01:04:22.750 --> 01:04:23.780
Is it?

01:04:25.210 --> 01:04:26.560
That is.

01:05:32.180 --> 01:05:36.030
You disobeyed me. I wasn't
going to leave Ciarán there.

01:05:36.590 --> 01:05:41.360
Do you have any idea of ​​the
responsibility place on me?

01:05:42.360 --> 01:05:45.430
Our purpose is ordained
by God's office on Earth.

01:05:45.560 --> 01:05:48.010
It cannot be jeopardized
by anything or anyone.

01:05:48.160 --> 01:05:50.410
Your duty is to obey.

01:05:55.370 --> 01:05:59.440
Brother, there is a great war
being fought all around us.

01:05:59.910 --> 01:06:02.950
Our enemy is the devil
himself, and in this war,

01:06:03.550 --> 01:06:08.930
He waits a life time and an eternity
for a single moment of weakness.

01:06:10.720 --> 01:06:12.060
Such as yours.

01:06:12.990 --> 01:06:15.060
Do not give in to him again.

01:06:48.560 --> 01:06:49.800
Brother.

01:07:01.200 --> 01:07:02.240
They will kill us.

01:07:04.540 --> 01:07:06.040
We all alone.

01:07:06.910 --> 01:07:09.050
They have knights and horses.

01:07:09.710 --> 01:07:11.780
They will find our tracks. - Cathal.

01:07:11.950 --> 01:07:13.820
And they will kill us.

01:07:16.590 --> 01:07:18.060
We are not alone.

01:07:21.120 --> 01:07:22.570
We are never alone.

01:07:26.060 --> 01:07:27.630
Have faith.

01:07:50.920 --> 01:07:52.700
Praise be.

01:07:53.320 --> 01:07:54.820
God has heard us.

01:09:36.760 --> 01:09:41.470
How far do you think you can get?

01:09:42.130 --> 01:09:43.670
Twenty paces at most.

01:09:44.970 --> 01:09:47.810
Or do you think you can walk on water?

01:09:58.350 --> 01:10:00.450
It doesn't have to be this way.

01:10:01.880 --> 01:10:07.300
Just give me the rock
and I will let you live.

01:10:10.460 --> 01:10:14.500
I gave the same choice to
one of your brother monks.

01:10:16.230 --> 01:10:21.080
But at last, it was unreasonable.

01:10:24.770 --> 01:10:27.980
It shouldn't be a difficult decision.

01:11:43.390 --> 01:11:44.990
Like your father.

01:11:47.220 --> 01:11:49.460
Did you tell your fellow monks

01:11:50.530 --> 01:11:53.800
the reason the Church has trusted

01:11:53.930 --> 01:11:56.810
Geraldus Trencavel d'Albi.

01:11:56.930 --> 01:11:59.070
With such an important task?

01:12:01.600 --> 01:12:05.480
Are you denounce him as a heretic,

01:12:07.240 --> 01:12:12.560
and when he refused to
repent, you, his only son,

01:12:12.650 --> 01:12:16.150
sent him first to the wheel,
and then to the stake.

01:12:17.090 --> 01:12:22.500
After his land went to church,
your future in Rome was secured.

01:13:16.410 --> 01:13:17.450
Where now?

01:15:44.630 --> 01:15:47.770
Tell them they will be
paid once we reach to port.

01:15:49.200 --> 01:15:50.340
Tell them.

01:16:00.540 --> 01:16:02.650
Why do you laugh?! - Geraldus.

01:16:02.740 --> 01:16:07.020
We are men of God. Doesn't that mean
anything in this cursed country?

01:16:07.120 --> 01:16:08.920
Keep your voice down.

01:16:14.360 --> 01:16:17.360
We could force him. We could.

01:16:18.760 --> 01:16:21.040
No, he will not. - Our need is great.

01:16:21.230 --> 01:16:23.230
You will not, brother.
- You disobey me again?

01:16:24.600 --> 01:16:28.950
You are not worthy to carry the relic.
There is something in you, boy...

01:16:29.040 --> 01:16:31.040
something evil. - Wait.

01:17:17.350 --> 01:17:19.060
Was there truth to what he said?

01:17:20.860 --> 01:17:22.430
About your father.

01:17:28.930 --> 01:17:30.530
He sheltered heretics.

01:17:31.630 --> 01:17:33.270
Helped them escape trial.

01:17:34.740 --> 01:17:37.680
I served the Church to
the best of my ability.

01:17:37.770 --> 01:17:39.510
My conscience is clear.

01:17:41.880 --> 01:17:43.910
What else do you wish to know, boy?

01:17:46.680 --> 01:17:47.720
Nothing.

01:17:56.690 --> 01:18:00.830
I asked him to repent, but he did not.

01:18:02.760 --> 01:18:06.770
Right till the end, he refused to
believe that he had done anything wrong.

01:18:09.770 --> 01:18:12.150
I learned something
very important that day.

01:18:13.440 --> 01:18:16.750
It wasn't his faith in
the church that he lost.

01:18:19.450 --> 01:18:21.330
It was his fear of it.

01:20:41.160 --> 01:20:43.730
What are you saying?

01:21:21.400 --> 01:21:23.970
No, push in the name of Christ.

01:21:24.070 --> 01:21:25.640
Go with God.

01:23:40.740 --> 01:23:42.720
Dugald.

01:26:07.550 --> 01:26:09.120
Hell.

01:27:00.800 --> 01:27:02.150
Do you hear them?

01:27:03.640 --> 01:27:05.170
Did you hear the bells?

01:27:10.110 --> 01:27:15.030
The bell will inspire
an army of men like him.

01:27:19.150 --> 01:27:23.830
Men will retake Jerusalem.
Men who will retake the world.

01:27:27.060 --> 01:27:31.030
The Heretics, the infidels, the faithless.

01:27:31.170 --> 01:27:34.370
If they will not hear the
truth, they will suffer.

01:27:36.270 --> 01:27:38.750
All doubt will be swapped away.

01:27:40.010 --> 01:27:44.720
Stand with the Church and live,
stand against it and be crushed.

01:27:53.990 --> 01:27:55.370
What are you doing?

01:27:56.760 --> 01:27:57.960
No.

01:28:02.330 --> 01:28:03.570
This is God's stone.

01:28:03.700 --> 01:28:06.010
I'm giving it back to him! No!

01:28:12.940 --> 01:28:14.510
The devil has you, boy.
