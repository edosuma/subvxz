01:25.753 --> 01:30.255
[man] What I'm saying is
that it's more than
what it seems, that's all.

01:30.758 --> 01:37.429
Much more. People don't know
because they're too busy
with their game shows

01:37.431 --> 01:43.869
and football and silliness
to take the time to look
and read and figure it all out.

01:43.871 --> 01:48.140
Who is it that said,
"Believe none of what you hear
and half of what you see"?

01:48.642 --> 01:51.176
These are interesting times
we're living in.

01:51.779 --> 01:56.348
That's another saying.
Chinese. Actually, it's a curse.

01:56.784 --> 01:58.951
All you have to do is look

01:58.953 --> 02:02.521
and learn to connect the dots
and get ready.

02:02.790 --> 02:06.792
Did you know there's
only three days' worth of food
in the stores

02:06.794 --> 02:11.230
and when the S-H-T-F,
the 99% are gonna be
out of commission.

02:11.966 --> 02:13.398
[sighs]

02:13.400 --> 02:14.666
I'm only telling you this

02:14.668 --> 02:16.668
because I wouldn't be
a good father to you

02:16.670 --> 02:20.439
if I didn't let you know
all the stuff that I know.

02:20.441 --> 02:24.943
It bears repeating,
so I'm repeating it,
so you can be prepared.

02:24.945 --> 02:28.313
It's only a matter of time
and it's not far off now.

02:28.315 --> 02:29.815
All you have to do
is look around.

02:29.817 --> 02:32.217
You can see it
if you open your eyes.

02:32.419 --> 02:36.355
The biggest problem we have
isn't anything that
a little focus couldn't cure.

02:36.357 --> 02:38.323
And it's not like it's so hard.

02:38.325 --> 02:42.995
There's tons of information
out there if people
just take the time to look.

02:43.464 --> 02:48.167
And if you think being busy
with all that stuff
you think is so important,

02:48.169 --> 02:51.537
well, you're gonna learn
that that's not
what really matters,

02:51.539 --> 02:54.873
I mean what really matters.

02:55.709 --> 02:59.444
All that's gonna matter
is what you do now.

02:59.847 --> 03:03.682
And I'm not saying all this
to scare you
or because I'm scared,

03:03.684 --> 03:07.753
because I'm not scared,
if that's what you think,
no, I'm ready.

03:09.023 --> 03:11.623
I just want to be ready.

03:15.529 --> 03:17.462

[beeping]

03:59.373 --> 04:01.306
And $22.56.

04:03.444 --> 04:07.346
It's always a good idea
to know your neighbor.

04:08.882 --> 04:11.016
You never know
when you might need 'em.

04:13.254 --> 04:14.987
Can I see
your driver's license?

Phew.

[Ed] Nice car.

It's not a Ford.
You like it?

Yeah. It's good... on gas.

Oh. Hi.

15:11.678 --> 15:13.611
Just some stuff.

15:14.447 --> 15:15.580
And how about you?

15:15.582 --> 15:18.149
Yeah, I'm just
getting some stuff too.

15:18.919 --> 15:22.020
Well, it's good
to see you again, Ronnie.

15:22.756 --> 15:25.256
All right.
You have a good day.

Ed.

Wow, you were busy.
What're you getting ready for?

15:37.537 --> 15:39.604
Oh, no. I just
needed some things.

15:39.606 --> 15:43.007
You're ready, aren't you?
I get it. I can see it.

15:43.576 --> 15:44.776
You can see?

15:44.778 --> 15:46.711
I knew it the minute I saw you.

15:47.113 --> 15:48.479
You know, the way
you were looking.

15:48.481 --> 15:50.615
Smart shopping, strategic.
I get it.

15:50.617 --> 15:53.084
Well, I was just
getting some things.

15:53.086 --> 15:56.154
Yeah, I know.
And I know you know.

15:57.724 --> 15:59.190
This is all going down.

16:01.962 --> 16:03.194
You like coffee?

16:03.830 --> 16:06.898
You gotta realize
there's more to it than that.

16:06.900 --> 16:10.335
There's things
that most people
don't understand.

16:11.471 --> 16:12.971
America.

16:12.973 --> 16:16.074
This is such a special place.

16:16.076 --> 16:18.576
Special in history.

16:19.646 --> 16:21.479
You gotta look
at the whole picture.

16:21.781 --> 16:24.215
You ever hear
of<i> The Federalist Papers?</i>

16:24.818 --> 16:26.150
Uh-uh.

16:26.152 --> 16:27.618
To know what they are,
you gotta go way back

16:27.620 --> 16:30.088
to what's called
the<i> Magna Carta.</i>

16:30.090 --> 16:31.923
That's when things
really got going,

16:31.925 --> 16:34.158
but you can go back
further than that if you want.

16:34.160 --> 16:37.795
See, it's all a matter
of controlling people.

16:37.797 --> 16:39.664
You got basically two types:

16:39.666 --> 16:42.000
those who want to control you
and those who don't
want to be controlled.

16:42.302 --> 16:44.702
That's me, the second type.

16:44.704 --> 16:46.204
You want more coffee?

16:46.840 --> 16:49.007
Oh, no. No. I...

16:49.009 --> 16:51.075
Ooh. Ooh, I got to get back.

16:52.846 --> 16:56.681
[sighs]
Yeah, I gotta get back
to some stuff, too.

17:02.889 --> 17:04.022
[bell jingles]

17:04.357 --> 17:06.824
You need to borrow my watch
next time?

17:06.826 --> 17:08.226
Sorry.

17:29.215 --> 17:30.782
[bell jingles]

17:34.220 --> 17:35.720
[Ed] You like pie?
[gasps]

17:39.559 --> 17:41.025
I like pie.

17:41.027 --> 17:43.227
Just 'cause they have
some great pies

17:43.229 --> 17:44.562
at Guy's Grill.

17:44.564 --> 17:46.230
I was thinking maybe
we could go to dinner

17:46.232 --> 17:48.266
and then finish up
with a couple of slices.

17:48.268 --> 17:51.602
Apple, peach. Around 8:00?

17:53.006 --> 17:54.439
8:00 sounds good.

17:54.908 --> 17:56.607
Oh. Good.

18:19.933 --> 18:21.466
They have karaoke.

18:25.105 --> 18:26.237
[singing]

18:26.239 --> 18:28.339
[cheering]

18:28.741 --> 18:31.442
[Ed] Not that there's
anything special about it.

18:31.444 --> 18:34.178
The way I see it,
we're pretty much
all the same.

18:34.714 --> 18:40.885
I'm your basic, average
red-blooded American male.

18:40.887 --> 18:42.620
I got a son, Brian.

18:42.622 --> 18:46.390
He's got a nice family.
Great daughter. Pretty wife.

18:46.392 --> 18:50.461
They got a big house
about an hour or so
from here.

18:50.463 --> 18:54.065
I had him around the time
I started with Capital Bearings.

18:54.067 --> 18:58.536
I did systems analysis.
Basically quality control.

18:58.905 --> 19:03.307
You have no idea
how screwed up
the world would be

19:03.309 --> 19:04.709
if it weren't
for ball bearings.

19:05.245 --> 19:10.581
And they have to be perfect,
and I mean perfect,
or else, boom!

19:10.583 --> 19:14.085
About six years ago,
I took the severance.

19:14.087 --> 19:17.088
It was a...
pretty decent deal.

19:17.090 --> 19:19.023
I'm not the type to complain.

19:19.025 --> 19:22.660
The way I see it,
I'm on the wrong side
of 60 anyway,

19:22.662 --> 19:25.229
I'm not getting any younger,
but I'm...

19:25.498 --> 19:28.533
I'm talking too much.
How about you?
You have kids?

19:29.936 --> 19:33.271
Um... my daughter died.

19:39.279 --> 19:40.878
She was my world.

19:42.515 --> 19:45.950
But... It wasn't fair.

19:46.519 --> 19:50.254
But you know what they say
about life.

19:51.324 --> 19:52.523
Yeah.

19:52.859 --> 19:56.761
I like to sew, though.
Um, I, uh...

19:57.297 --> 19:59.363
I got some stuff
I like to do.

19:59.365 --> 20:01.032
Oh, that's...

20:02.168 --> 20:03.467
I'm sorry.

20:03.469 --> 20:06.404
Yeah. It was...

20:06.406 --> 20:08.773
She was special.

20:10.977 --> 20:13.277
She was going to be 13.

20:14.480 --> 20:15.947
How'd she die?

20:16.349 --> 20:17.648
Well...

20:18.318 --> 20:20.551
It was a really rare disease.

20:20.553 --> 20:21.786
MENS.

20:22.755 --> 20:23.921
"Men"?

20:24.557 --> 20:30.628
M-E-N-S.
It's Multiple Endocrine
Neoplasia Syndrome.

20:31.731 --> 20:34.799
I read so much.

20:36.669 --> 20:39.770
The doctors said,
nothing they could do.

20:40.940 --> 20:42.807
But I don't know, I...

20:45.612 --> 20:47.979
-Your husband?
-He died, too.

20:48.581 --> 20:51.349
But not from a rare disease.
Just cancer.

20:51.918 --> 20:55.686
I told him not to smoke,
but what can you do?

20:56.923 --> 20:58.656
What can any of us do?

20:59.892 --> 21:04.829
You know what you said before
about being on
the wrong side of 60?

21:06.599 --> 21:09.700
To me, I don't think
there's a wrong side of 60.

21:13.640 --> 21:16.440
You know,
I don't mind telling you...

21:16.442 --> 21:18.609
I think you got
a real nose for this game.

21:18.611 --> 21:22.513
The way people look at things.
It's all in the eyes.

21:23.216 --> 21:26.717
What kind of tuna
do you prefer?
Generally speaking.

21:27.587 --> 21:30.488
Oh... I guess Charlie.

21:30.790 --> 21:33.391
StarKist. Me too.
Paper products?

21:33.393 --> 21:34.992
Paper products?

21:34.994 --> 21:37.795
Yeah, you know, toilet paper.
It's important.

21:37.797 --> 21:41.299
Oh. Well, I don't really
think about it.
I just squeeze 'em.

21:41.301 --> 21:42.967
Right.

21:42.969 --> 21:46.804
It's all about
not making things harder
than they have to be.

21:46.806 --> 21:50.474
-Batteries?
-I know this one. Coppertop.

21:50.677 --> 21:52.843
Generic on that one
as far as I'm concerned,

21:52.845 --> 21:55.546
as long as it's alkaline.
That's key.

21:56.449 --> 21:58.849
You seem to know
a lot about stuff.

21:59.152 --> 22:02.086
Well, I do. Because I care.

22:03.022 --> 22:04.555
I can see that.

Well, I know.
I'm not a great singer.

Oh. Yes.

26:39.599 --> 26:41.332
[Ed] Ah, here. Let's see.

26:42.435 --> 26:46.170
So, what do you like to see?
Sports? No? [laughs]

26:46.572 --> 26:48.906
No, I'm kidding. Movies?

26:48.908 --> 26:51.342
I like movies. Old ones.

26:51.644 --> 26:53.644
Back when they knew
what they were doing.

26:54.046 --> 26:55.746
Yeah, things were
different then

26:55.748 --> 26:58.449
and I don't mind saying
it was better
as far as I'm concerned.

26:58.451 --> 27:01.785
I mean,
I like being progressive
and all that sort of thing,

27:01.787 --> 27:05.289
but there comes a point
when you just gotta say,

27:05.291 --> 27:08.225
John Wayne
is where I want to be,
you know what I mean?

27:08.227 --> 27:09.760
Uh, I think so.

27:09.762 --> 27:11.729
So, what kind of movies
do you like?

27:11.731 --> 27:13.330
Documentaries.

27:13.633 --> 27:16.967
Mm. On what?
What kind of subject?

27:16.969 --> 27:18.035
War.

[Ed] I wouldn't have pegged you
as a war type.

27:28.914 --> 27:31.649
[Ronnie] War is so interesting.

27:31.917 --> 27:34.151
My dad was in the war.
The big one.

27:34.153 --> 27:35.619
[narrator continues, indistinct]

27:35.621 --> 27:37.421
Do you know where?
Well...

27:37.423 --> 27:40.658
He said he saw the world.
He said it was great.

27:40.660 --> 27:43.227
Well, yeah. I was...

27:44.130 --> 27:47.831
[sighs] Well,
I never got to go.

27:48.701 --> 27:51.201
Oh, no?
That's a good thing,
isn't it?

27:51.203 --> 27:54.405
Oh, I don't know.
A man can learn
a lot about himself in war.

27:54.874 --> 27:59.243
Yeah. My dad just mostly
learned how to drink.

27:59.945 --> 28:01.412
Then there's that, too.

28:07.486 --> 28:09.219
You like to drink, Ed?

28:09.221 --> 28:10.421
Sometimes.

28:12.191 --> 28:15.359
Well, not a lot.
I like to keep a clear head.

28:15.361 --> 28:18.028
You never know
when you're gonna
need your wits.

28:38.818 --> 28:39.917
Oh.

Can we just sit here, please?

I mean I know that...

28:47.860 --> 28:50.260
I-- I just like being here.

28:50.996 --> 28:53.797
Just sitting, watching TV.

28:56.368 --> 29:00.270

We can sit and watch TV.

I'm late for work.

30:11.510 --> 30:13.644

a little late for work.

you are doing the walk of shame.

Don't worry about me.

32:10.429 --> 32:12.629
You're not out of the way
or anything.

32:12.631 --> 32:15.265
Oh, it's... I'm fine.

32:15.267 --> 32:17.401

Yeah, I'm fine.

32:17.403 --> 32:20.270

I can do it like you do

What...

34:14.053 --> 34:15.952
We don't have to do Chinese.

34:16.221 --> 34:21.558
Ed Hemsler,
a woman doesn't like
to be left in the dark.

34:23.262 --> 34:25.495
When a gentleman takes her out,

34:25.497 --> 34:28.065
the least he could do
is contact her in some way

34:28.067 --> 34:32.335
and let her know
that he had fond memories
of their evening together

34:32.337 --> 34:36.406
even if he didn't,
because that's what
gentlemen do.

34:36.408 --> 34:38.275
But I am a gentleman.

34:38.277 --> 34:40.243
Well, then where were you?

34:40.245 --> 34:41.912
Why didn't you call me?

34:42.781 --> 34:46.249
I thought you might want
a break or something.

34:46.251 --> 34:48.418
A break from what?

34:48.720 --> 34:50.454
Well, from me.

34:55.060 --> 34:56.593
I kissed you.

34:59.031 --> 35:00.330
You did.

35:05.104 --> 35:06.703
Chinese is fine.

35:08.874 --> 35:10.507
I'll be right out front.

35:10.776 --> 35:13.376
You can find out the truth

where to look for it.

35:13.378 --> 35:17.280
The Internet
is the biggest library
in the universe.

of logic and limitation.

35:22.254 --> 35:23.820
And I like to swim.

35:23.822 --> 35:25.288
Ask me something.

35:25.290 --> 35:27.124
Something? Like what?

35:27.126 --> 35:28.892
Something like anything.

35:30.629 --> 35:33.029
Well, I don't know.
Like what?

35:33.265 --> 35:36.199
Isn't there something
you want to know
that you don't know?

35:36.802 --> 35:38.301
Not really.

35:38.937 --> 35:41.304
-Nothing?
-No.

35:42.808 --> 35:45.175
So, you know everything there is
you want to know.

35:45.177 --> 35:46.476
No, I didn't say that.

35:46.478 --> 35:48.245
So, what do you want to know?

35:49.781 --> 35:53.350
I think what I mean is
I don't know
what I want to know yet.

35:53.986 --> 35:55.185
About you.

35:55.954 --> 35:58.989
And when I know
what I want to know,
I'll let you know.

36:00.259 --> 36:01.558
Is that okay?

36:02.861 --> 36:04.227
Yeah.

36:39.131 --> 36:40.664
Well, I did earn it.

36:40.666 --> 36:43.333
Seventeen years of earning it
doing real work.

36:43.335 --> 36:46.870
Work that mattered,
back when people
honored their commitments.

36:46.872 --> 36:50.240
But now, all I can say is
good luck
when it's time to collect.

36:50.642 --> 36:53.043
We don't
accept checks anymore.

I'm saying all this stuff

36:59.518 --> 37:01.484
just to make you think
that I'm smarter than you

37:01.486 --> 37:03.053
so that I can act like
I'm still your father.

37:03.055 --> 37:05.722

I am still your father.

Yeah.

37:36.922 --> 37:40.757
I see him.
The way he waits
outside for you.

37:41.126 --> 37:43.226
He's, like,
so totally your BFF.

37:43.228 --> 37:44.628
What is that? A BFF?

Best friend forever.

37:47.199 --> 37:48.665
He waits for me?

Look, my guy,
the guy I'm into right now,
he's like that.

37:55.240 --> 37:57.607
He thinks about me.
He holds doors.

Oh, Ed does that.

38:00.412 --> 38:02.946

-Mm-hmm.

38:03.215 --> 38:05.115
Ed's a good name.

I mean, it's not very original,
but that might not be
such a bad thing.

-You want my opinion?
-Yeah.

38:12.157 --> 38:14.357
I say, ride it like a wave.

What's that mean? "Ride it--"

38:17.296 --> 38:19.996
Don't fall off the board
and it's all good.

When I'm you're age,
if don't mess it up,

to Thanksgiving

38:39.785 --> 38:40.884
Whoa.

38:41.253 --> 38:43.520
Turkey is a serious thing.

38:44.122 --> 38:45.355
It's a commitment.

38:45.824 --> 38:48.558
You can tell
a lot about a person
by how they cook a turkey.

38:48.927 --> 38:51.761
I don't think
Ed's gonna be making the turkey.

39:03.275 --> 39:04.674
[chimes]

39:09.848 --> 39:11.181
[sighs]

39:11.183 --> 39:12.682
[chimes]

39:19.291 --> 39:20.590
[Ed]<i> I've got you.</i>

39:21.026 --> 39:22.092
Sure?

39:24.229 --> 39:25.762
Almost there.

39:29.534 --> 39:32.135
Keep them closed.
Okay, I am.

39:32.137 --> 39:36.473
Showing you this
means I'm trusting you
more than anybody.

39:36.975 --> 39:39.242
What is it?
No, keep 'em closed.

39:39.244 --> 39:40.643
They're closed.

39:40.645 --> 39:42.379
Even my son
has never seen this.

39:42.381 --> 39:44.214
For goodness' sake,
what is it?

39:45.350 --> 39:46.916
Open them now.

39:46.918 --> 39:48.118
Okay.

39:52.190 --> 39:53.623
You can't see it, can you?

39:54.526 --> 39:56.059
What can't I see?

40:06.671 --> 40:08.171
[lock clicks]

40:24.256 --> 40:25.655
Oh.

40:34.266 --> 40:35.799
[Ronnie] Oh.

40:35.801 --> 40:40.670
You have to promise me
that you will never tell anyone
what you've seen here today.

40:42.140 --> 40:44.607
I do, I... I promise.

40:44.609 --> 40:46.409
Because if people find out,

40:46.411 --> 40:49.846
when the S-H-T-F,
they will tear
this place apart.

40:52.050 --> 40:54.818
Not that I want to be
cruel or anything,

40:54.820 --> 40:57.520
but they've had
plenty of warning.

40:58.790 --> 41:01.257
This is the power supply
over here.

41:01.259 --> 41:02.292
[mechanical whirring, humming]

41:02.294 --> 41:04.727
I got these special mufflers

41:06.965 --> 41:09.549
I designed myself.

41:09.550 --> 41:12.134
The exhaust is channeled around
to the other side of the house
to a hidden chute.

41:13.004 --> 41:15.138
[clattering]

41:17.309 --> 41:19.909
[whispers] Well,
you really are ready
for anything.

41:20.745 --> 41:22.212
The way I see it,

41:22.914 --> 41:25.648
you never know
when things are gonna go south.

41:26.785 --> 41:30.820
The world, the flesh
and the devil conspire,

41:30.822 --> 41:32.856
and things fall apart.

41:33.358 --> 41:36.593
This is my security blanket...

41:37.496 --> 41:38.928
my safety net...

41:40.966 --> 41:42.732
my 401k.

41:43.835 --> 41:46.703
You remember when you asked me

41:46.705 --> 41:50.907
if there was anything
that I wanted to know
that I didn't know?

41:51.510 --> 41:52.942
Yeah.

41:53.445 --> 41:57.680
How-- how did you do this?

41:59.618 --> 42:02.051
What-- what do you mean?

42:03.722 --> 42:05.188
It's perfect.

42:27.546 --> 42:29.812
[chattering]

42:36.588 --> 42:38.288
[chattering]

42:39.658 --> 42:41.057
Wrong.

42:45.764 --> 42:47.163
[gasps]

42:49.701 --> 42:50.967
[chuckles]

42:51.236 --> 42:52.735
[clattering]

42:55.006 --> 42:56.172
Ooh.

43:01.246 --> 43:02.979
Don't... No, I can't.

43:04.282 --> 43:06.282
Ooh! [chuckles]

43:10.288 --> 43:13.289
Whoa! Whoo!

43:13.291 --> 43:15.425
[chattering]

43:26.938 --> 43:28.137
Oh.

43:59.337 --> 44:01.638
Here, let me
help you with that.
Oh, no, I can handle it.

44:01.640 --> 44:03.006
Come on,
let me be the gentleman.

44:03.008 --> 44:05.308
You are
the perfect gentleman.

44:06.144 --> 44:07.310
Why...

44:07.679 --> 44:09.612
[sighs] Why don't you let me--

44:09.614 --> 44:10.980
Please?

44:12.751 --> 44:14.050
[kisses]

44:23.928 --> 44:25.428
The perfect gentleman.

44:31.803 --> 44:35.238
[sighs] Perfect.

44:59.330 --> 45:01.431
[breathing heavily]

45:18.516 --> 45:21.818
[Ed] I keep this place
to work on basic skill sets.

45:21.820 --> 45:24.087
You got nothing to be afraid of.

45:24.089 --> 45:26.055
[Ronnie] I said I'm not afraid.

45:26.491 --> 45:27.924
[Ed] Okay.

45:28.326 --> 45:31.928
And let your eye
go right down the barrel
to sight what you want to hit.

45:31.930 --> 45:34.063
Couldn't you thought
of something more sinister?

45:34.065 --> 45:36.432
-[Ed] Oh, it's a bear.
-It's a teddy bear.

45:36.735 --> 45:38.067
You're--

45:38.737 --> 45:40.903
Ooh! [laughs]

45:40.905 --> 45:43.306
-Whoa!
-I did it! I did.

46:01.793 --> 46:03.159
[chuckles]

46:04.028 --> 46:06.129
What are you laughing about?

46:08.399 --> 46:09.499
This.

46:10.401 --> 46:11.801
Us. Here.

46:12.070 --> 46:14.437
[chuckles]
It's so peaceful.

46:15.406 --> 46:16.539
Mm-hmm.

46:17.408 --> 46:18.508
It's nice.

46:19.444 --> 46:23.179
I laugh because soon,
it's all gonna be over.

46:24.549 --> 46:26.015
What do you mean?

46:27.719 --> 46:29.385
I mean moments like this.

46:31.089 --> 46:33.556
They're going to be few
and far between.

46:34.325 --> 46:38.694
Most of the time
we'll be scrambling to survive.

46:38.963 --> 46:43.800
Ed, I don't understand.
What-- Survive what?

46:44.469 --> 46:47.036
Oh, you have to know
what I'm talking about.

46:48.072 --> 46:53.042
Deep down, you can feel it
even if you don't
admit it to yourself.

46:54.145 --> 46:56.913
[scoffs] It might start
with a news bulletin.

46:57.749 --> 47:04.253
You're watching a commercial
or something, and suddenly,
this guy comes on.

47:04.255 --> 47:07.356
One of those
plastic talking robots

47:07.358 --> 47:10.393
telling us
the stock market
is gonna crash.

47:11.830 --> 47:13.696
Then the president comes on.

47:14.265 --> 47:18.034
And the people
are all waiting
for him to speak.

47:18.036 --> 47:22.171
And when he does, he says
there's a national emergency

47:22.173 --> 47:24.607
and he has to declare
martial law.

47:25.176 --> 47:27.677
So, you can't believe it.

47:28.112 --> 47:31.013
So, you go to the local store
and you see

47:31.015 --> 47:35.384
<i> everyone in the street</i>
<i> with a strange look</i>
<i> in their eyes</i>

47:35.386 --> 47:37.453
<i> because they can't</i>
<i> believe it too.</i>

47:38.189 --> 47:42.124
So, you get to the store
and it's filled with people

47:42.126 --> 47:45.194
buying everything
they can get their hands on.

47:45.697 --> 47:51.734
And up in the sky,
helicopters start going
whoop, whoop, overhead

47:51.736 --> 47:55.705
and you know... you know.

47:57.542 --> 48:01.711
The first day, you watch TV
trying to find out
what's going on,

48:01.713 --> 48:04.947
but by the third day,
it's nothing but static.

48:06.217 --> 48:09.886
And the net's down, too,
just like your cell phone.

48:10.521 --> 48:14.790
<i> Around about this time,</i>
<i> you hear the first gunshot.</i>

48:15.560 --> 48:19.896
<i> And at first,</i>
<i> it sounds strange and novel.</i>

48:19.898 --> 48:23.432
But then, it's everywhere.
It starts getting closer.

48:23.434 --> 48:27.169
-[helicopter whirring]
-[Ed]<i> And then, you see</i>
<i> a body in the street.</i>

48:27.171 --> 48:29.372
<i>Nobody has come to move it.</i>

48:29.374 --> 48:32.642
And then, another and another.

48:33.077 --> 48:36.913
So you decide to leave,
only you're not alone.

48:36.915 --> 48:39.682
The streets are
choked with cars.

48:40.685 --> 48:42.551
And then, the military comes.

48:42.553 --> 48:45.755
Only it's not our military,
it's some other country's,

48:45.757 --> 48:48.324
and you can't believe it.

48:48.893 --> 48:50.693
But you know it's true.

48:52.430 --> 48:53.763
You know.

48:56.034 --> 48:57.500
You know.

49:01.773 --> 49:03.172
It's all over.

49:08.980 --> 49:11.514
You really think
that's gonna happen?

49:15.920 --> 49:17.386
Ah.

49:18.122 --> 49:20.356
Maybe. I don't know.

49:24.295 --> 49:27.463
You're a really special lady,
Ronnie Meisner.

49:35.673 --> 49:37.173
[stammers] Ed?

50:27.525 --> 50:28.791
Are you okay?

50:30.862 --> 50:32.128
Aces.

52:21.939 --> 52:24.673
Dad. Welcome.
Hey.

52:26.177 --> 52:27.710
[Ed] This is, uh...

52:28.346 --> 52:30.212
my girlfriend, Ronnie.

52:30.948 --> 52:32.481
And a Happy Thanksgiving.

52:32.483 --> 52:34.817
Thank you so much.
Uh, Ronnie, I'm Brian.

52:34.819 --> 52:35.918
It's great to meet you.

52:35.920 --> 52:37.086
Ed.
Janet.

52:37.088 --> 52:38.821
Hi. [kisses]

52:38.823 --> 52:40.489
I'm so glad
you could make it.

52:40.491 --> 52:44.493
Oh, honey, this is Ronnie,
Dad's girlfriend.

52:46.297 --> 52:48.898
-Look at you. Adorable.
-Hey.

52:49.667 --> 52:52.501
-There's my girl.
-Hi, Grandpa.

52:55.840 --> 52:57.273
So, how's things going?

52:57.275 --> 52:58.374
Come in. Come in.

52:58.976 --> 53:00.676
I wouldn't want to be
part of that. [laughs]

53:00.678 --> 53:02.111
[Ed] Yeah,
you don't want that.

53:02.113 --> 53:03.546
[Janet] Jeanine.

53:07.618 --> 53:10.719
I'm Jeanine.
Nice to meet you. Ronnie.

53:11.355 --> 53:13.689
[male announcer on TV,
indistinct]

53:18.529 --> 53:21.730
How long has it been
with you two?

53:23.034 --> 53:25.701
Oh, not long.

53:25.703 --> 53:27.069
So, but...

53:27.071 --> 53:28.470
But it's good?

53:28.806 --> 53:29.805
Yeah.

53:29.807 --> 53:33.909
You two,
you both seem so young,

53:34.712 --> 53:35.778
so vital.

53:36.981 --> 53:38.113
[chuckles]

53:38.249 --> 53:39.615
[sighs]

53:41.719 --> 53:43.485
You know you can turn it up
if you want.

53:44.055 --> 53:47.022
Oh, no. It's really
not a problem. I just
like to look at the score.

53:47.024 --> 53:48.290
Oh. You can turn it up.

53:48.859 --> 53:50.993
It's really better
with the sound down.

53:52.997 --> 53:54.296
[slurping]

53:55.032 --> 53:56.632
I know what you're thinking.

53:57.235 --> 53:58.834
I'm not thinking anything.

53:59.737 --> 54:02.571
I thought that's what
this was all about:
not thinking.

54:03.274 --> 54:05.474
You ever talk about
traveling together?

54:05.943 --> 54:07.142
Now's the time.

54:07.745 --> 54:11.480
Brian and I, we've been
plotting our trip to Spain.

54:11.682 --> 54:14.950
Oh. Spain sounds nice.

54:14.952 --> 54:16.552
It's hard, you know.

54:16.554 --> 54:19.588
Make the time to travel.

54:19.590 --> 54:22.925
To... get on track.

54:24.595 --> 54:27.496
How are you and Ed with that?
Are you...

54:28.266 --> 54:29.999
You guys on track?

54:32.370 --> 54:33.669
Uh...

54:34.438 --> 54:37.373
Yeah, great. We're on track.

54:38.442 --> 54:40.276
Don't be so sensitive.

54:40.278 --> 54:42.578
I get it.
The angry old man thing.

54:42.580 --> 54:44.546
I'm not angry. I care.

54:44.548 --> 54:46.315
I care, too.
About my family.

54:46.317 --> 54:50.019
Oh, you got a funny way
of showing it,
keeping your head in the sand.

54:51.822 --> 54:52.955
Okay.

54:54.458 --> 54:55.958
I'll bite.

54:55.960 --> 54:57.059
Show me.

54:57.762 --> 55:00.129
Brian, you--
No, really.

55:00.131 --> 55:02.131
Show me something worth seeing.

55:04.769 --> 55:06.001
All right.

55:10.908 --> 55:12.875
And so it begins.

55:13.611 --> 55:15.377
Where are they going?

55:16.414 --> 55:17.813
More wine?

55:18.816 --> 55:20.049
No, thanks.

55:20.618 --> 55:22.785
-[Ed] Did you even read it?
-[Brian] Of course I read it.

55:22.787 --> 55:25.187
You stood here
pacing back and forth
while I read the thing.

55:25.189 --> 55:26.989
What's in your bug-out bag?

55:27.425 --> 55:28.824
What is a bug-out bag?

55:28.826 --> 55:31.894
The bag that's waiting for you
when the S-H-T-F.

55:32.363 --> 55:33.462
The what?

55:33.464 --> 55:35.097
When the shit hits the fan!

55:35.366 --> 55:36.699
[groans]

55:37.301 --> 55:39.568
[sighing deeply]

55:40.471 --> 55:43.105
Why do you always
act like this?

55:43.107 --> 55:44.673
Like what?

55:44.675 --> 55:47.509
Like you're in on some secret
that nobody else knows about.

55:47.511 --> 55:50.346
I'm not the only one.
There are lots of people
that know what's going on.

55:50.348 --> 55:53.816
That's right, you're all
sitting around in your underwear
with your computers...

55:53.818 --> 55:55.851
I do not sit around
in my underwear!

55:55.853 --> 55:57.619
Okay, whatever the fuck
you're wearing,

55:57.621 --> 55:59.855
you're all telling me that
the government is doing this,

55:59.857 --> 56:01.990
and corporations
are doing the other thing.

56:01.992 --> 56:06.028
But you know what I see
are just people
trying to survive.

56:06.030 --> 56:07.863
Exactly, survive!

56:10.034 --> 56:12.368
Look, all I'm saying is...

56:12.370 --> 56:14.002
Wait... Let me show you.

56:14.004 --> 56:16.705
Why don't you just admit it?
You're scared.

56:16.707 --> 56:20.909
You're scared to face the fact
that you're never gonna
figure it all out, and so what?

56:20.911 --> 56:23.479
That's just the world,
that's what it is.

56:23.481 --> 56:25.214
-[Janet] Dinner.
-It's fucked up!

56:25.216 --> 56:28.617
It is crazy. It's stupid.
but it's just the world.

56:29.053 --> 56:29.885
Dinner.

56:29.887 --> 56:31.720
[Brian] And you know what?

56:31.722 --> 56:34.056
We are all gonna die one day.

56:34.992 --> 56:35.657
Even you.

56:39.163 --> 56:40.763
[Janet screaming] Dinner!

56:42.400 --> 56:44.066
Go to the far outside.

56:44.068 --> 56:45.901
-[Ronnie] And slice it...
-[Ed] Shape, slice...

56:45.903 --> 56:48.103
[Brian] Go work my way there.
[Janet] Yes, you work your way.

56:48.105 --> 56:50.272
Please help yourselves.
Don't let it get cold.

56:50.741 --> 56:52.408
-[Brian] You'll have that?
-[Janet] Yes.

56:52.410 --> 56:54.143
Thanks, Brian.

56:55.246 --> 56:57.246
-[Brian] This looks
very, very...
-And sweet potatoes?

56:57.248 --> 56:59.848
Oh, we're not doing
sweet potatoes this year.

56:59.850 --> 57:02.017
No sweet potatoes?
Mm-mmm.

57:02.019 --> 57:03.585
It must really be
the end of the world.

57:03.587 --> 57:04.787
You should try this.

57:04.789 --> 57:06.388
It's basmati rice.
It's from India.

57:06.390 --> 57:08.524
I know
what basmati rice is, Mom.

57:08.526 --> 57:10.092
Next, you're gonna tell me
to finish it all

57:10.094 --> 57:11.960
because of starving children
in India or something.

57:11.962 --> 57:15.164
Which reminds me,
why exactly are we
eating their rice?

57:15.699 --> 57:18.167
It's not theirs,
it's yours now.

57:18.569 --> 57:20.169
So, yes,
you should finish it.

57:21.605 --> 57:24.373
-It's exotic.
-[Janet] It's a little
festive this year, dinner.

57:24.375 --> 57:25.441
[Brian] It's innovative, right?

57:25.443 --> 57:27.709
[chattering continues]

57:29.079 --> 57:32.815
I don't know if I'm starving,
or if it's actually good...

57:32.817 --> 57:37.920
You know, I was just talking
to Ronnie here about her and Ed
maybe taking a little trip.

57:37.922 --> 57:38.954
Hmm?

57:38.956 --> 57:41.390
Maybe going someplace exotic?

57:42.293 --> 57:44.993
I'm sure if they
want to take a trip,
they'll take a trip.

57:47.498 --> 57:49.231
I'd like to see China.

57:49.567 --> 57:52.668
China? You know
what they're doing over there?

57:53.437 --> 57:54.903
I like the food.

57:54.905 --> 57:57.139
There's more to the world
than Chinese restaurants.

57:57.141 --> 57:58.507
[Brian] Here we go.

57:58.509 --> 57:59.975
Like what, Grandpa?

57:59.977 --> 58:01.844
Well, the thing about China--

58:01.846 --> 58:04.279
I think your grandpa
would like to have
his dinner in peace.

58:04.281 --> 58:07.249
-No, no. I--
-I know what you're doing,
young lady.

58:07.251 --> 58:08.984
I'm not doing anything.

58:08.986 --> 58:11.487
Oh, that's right.
You're so clever.
You're smarter than all of us.

58:11.489 --> 58:13.755
-Oh, my fucking God.
-Jeanine!

58:13.757 --> 58:16.792
[scoffs] Like I'm saying
anything you haven't said
a million times.

58:16.794 --> 58:18.760
I can assure you,
I do not use--

58:18.762 --> 58:20.496
[Jeanine]
Why do you always
have to pretend

58:20.498 --> 58:22.664
to be something you're not?
[scoffs]

58:22.666 --> 58:24.967
It's like
I'm living in<i> The Twilight Zone.</i>

58:24.969 --> 58:27.669
Oh, please. You don't even know
what<i> The Twilight Zone</i> is.

58:27.671 --> 58:29.438
It's a stupid TV show
in black-and-white,

58:29.440 --> 58:32.941
so, yes, I know what
<i> The Twilight Zone</i> is, Brian.

58:32.943 --> 58:34.376
All right, that's enough.

58:34.378 --> 58:36.111
[sighs] What?

58:36.113 --> 58:37.713
Are you gonna
send me to my room, Brian?

58:37.715 --> 58:39.615
-As a matter of fact, yeah.
-[Ed] Hey.

58:39.617 --> 58:43.018
Hey. What kind of daughter
calls her father
by his first name?

58:43.020 --> 58:45.587
One who has no respect.
That kind.

58:46.056 --> 58:47.523
[laughs] For what?

58:47.525 --> 58:48.590
For what?

58:49.026 --> 58:51.960
For what? How about
the roof over your head.

58:51.962 --> 58:54.363
Or how about the orthodontist?
Or how about the phone?

58:54.365 --> 58:58.000
Or how about all the schoolbooks
that I buy you you never even
have time to read?

58:58.002 --> 59:01.303
Why should I?
The world's gonna end
any day now anyway.

59:01.305 --> 59:04.540
That is just great.
You see, you have
her talking this crap now!

59:04.542 --> 59:07.376
-You see what you've done?
-Jeanine's got
a mind of her own.

59:07.378 --> 59:09.711
Yeah, I just decide to use it.

59:09.713 --> 59:11.079
To stockpile nonsense?

59:11.081 --> 59:13.015
You know what?
How about we all calm down

59:13.017 --> 59:16.218
and maybe we talk about
something that we can
all agree on.

59:16.220 --> 59:18.820
Hmm?
Me and Brian
agree on something.

59:19.156 --> 59:21.323
We both think
our fathers are assholes!

59:21.325 --> 59:24.560
All right, that's it.
Zero 'tronics for you.

59:24.562 --> 59:26.929
That means one month,
no TV, no phone.

59:26.931 --> 59:28.830
-No phone?
-Yeah.

59:28.832 --> 59:30.499
Ask your grandpa about that.

59:30.501 --> 59:33.068
How're y'all
gonna deal with that
when the Internet goes down,

59:33.070 --> 59:35.170
the electrical grid collapses,

59:35.172 --> 59:36.905
and then, you have
to communicate with what?

59:36.907 --> 59:38.907
You guys are gonna have to
use smoke signals--

59:38.909 --> 59:41.243
-Mom!
-Maybe if you had
a little bit more self control.

59:41.245 --> 59:43.645
I hope the world does end
and takes you with it!

59:44.248 --> 59:47.349
Come back here, young lady!
Come back here!

59:51.689 --> 59:53.855
-[Ed] Hey!
-More wine?

59:53.857 --> 59:55.290
Yeah, please.
Okay.

59:56.860 --> 59:59.194
[sighing] Not again.

1:00:00.531 --> 1:00:02.097
[sighs]

1:00:03.367 --> 1:00:04.766
Where is she going?

1:00:05.135 --> 1:00:06.368
Nowhere.

1:00:09.940 --> 1:00:11.373
You think I'm an asshole?

1:01:08.866 --> 1:01:11.066
[sighs] Good night, Ronnie.

1:01:25.449 --> 1:01:27.082
Don't you want to come in?

1:02:00.417 --> 1:02:02.150
[sighs]

1:02:03.153 --> 1:02:04.286
Oh, hell.

1:02:14.231 --> 1:02:15.797
Jesus.

1:02:32.416 --> 1:02:33.815
Oh...

1:02:37.955 --> 1:02:39.755
Would you like a drink?

1:02:39.957 --> 1:02:41.957
I thought you were
a fellow traveler.

1:02:42.226 --> 1:02:44.459
I am a fellow traveler!

1:02:44.461 --> 1:02:46.661
No! I mean a prepper.

1:02:46.930 --> 1:02:49.798
The way you shopped,
the stuff you bought.

1:02:49.800 --> 1:02:51.833
You used cash!

1:02:52.269 --> 1:02:55.604
[sighs] Not that I go in
for that level of paranoia
personally,

1:02:55.606 --> 1:02:58.607
but, hey, you can see
how I could have
come to that conclusion.

1:02:58.609 --> 1:03:02.144
Cash is easier.
You don't have to
remember numbers.

1:03:02.146 --> 1:03:04.112
You might try checks.

1:03:04.114 --> 1:03:06.348
[Ronnie]
Everybody doesn't take checks.

1:03:06.984 --> 1:03:09.151
Everybody takes cash.

1:03:17.728 --> 1:03:19.161
[sighs]

1:03:21.932 --> 1:03:23.465
[coughs, gasps]

1:03:31.074 --> 1:03:32.507
[exhales sharply]

1:03:32.509 --> 1:03:35.777
When my daughter died,
it started up in her room,

1:03:35.779 --> 1:03:38.980
and it just...
came down here.

1:03:39.817 --> 1:03:41.016
But...

1:03:41.418 --> 1:03:43.185
I don't understand
how you could--

1:03:43.187 --> 1:03:44.319
Please.

1:03:57.868 --> 1:03:59.401
[moaning]

1:04:07.845 --> 1:04:10.445
[groaning]
[clattering]

1:04:14.484 --> 1:04:16.585
[Ronnie] Oh... Oh.

1:04:16.887 --> 1:04:18.420
[Ed grunts]

1:04:18.856 --> 1:04:21.189
[both moaning]

1:06:14.137 --> 1:06:16.037
Oh, don't worry about it!

1:06:26.984 --> 1:06:31.519
Do you want your toast buttered
or you wanna do it yourself?

1:06:32.322 --> 1:06:34.556
[Ed] Oh, no, you can butter it.

1:06:56.013 --> 1:06:57.846
[clattering, thudding]

1:06:57.848 --> 1:07:00.281
[Ronnie]
Oh, just leave it.

1:07:00.283 --> 1:07:02.517
I don't want you
to hurt yourself.

1:07:04.121 --> 1:07:05.420
[gasps]

1:07:10.127 --> 1:07:11.526
Ed?

1:07:14.998 --> 1:07:17.265
[chattering]

1:07:20.637 --> 1:07:22.937
[doctor] Mrs. Meisner?
How is he?

1:07:23.340 --> 1:07:25.573
[doctor] Your husband's--
No, he's my boyfriend.

1:07:25.575 --> 1:07:29.144
[doctor] Your boyfriend
has had what we call a TIA.

1:07:29.146 --> 1:07:31.880
It's like a mini stroke,
but temporary.

1:07:31.882 --> 1:07:34.482
It seems he's been
rationing his medications,

1:07:34.484 --> 1:07:37.185
missing the target
on his recommended dosages.

1:07:37.187 --> 1:07:41.389
He's gonna be
a bit wobbly for a time,
but he seems like a tough man.

1:07:41.391 --> 1:07:43.091
Can I see him now?

1:07:43.093 --> 1:07:46.661
[doctor] Certainly,
but take it easy on him.

1:07:50.600 --> 1:07:51.800
[sighs]

1:08:07.084 --> 1:08:08.516
[Ronnie] Oh.

1:08:11.855 --> 1:08:13.855
You poor dear.

1:08:15.459 --> 1:08:19.227
No. No, no, no, no. Don't.
Don't try to speak. Shh.

1:08:19.229 --> 1:08:20.895
I'm not a poor dear.

1:08:20.897 --> 1:08:23.631
No. No.

1:08:23.633 --> 1:08:24.833
You're strong.

1:08:28.105 --> 1:08:33.208
The doctor told me
you weren't
taking your medication.

1:08:34.244 --> 1:08:36.611
Yeah, it's the money,
isn't it?

1:08:36.613 --> 1:08:40.949
I know how expensive
it gets. I know.

1:08:42.385 --> 1:08:46.187
But you? It make no sense.

1:08:46.957 --> 1:08:48.056
[sobs]

1:08:48.658 --> 1:08:52.961
You spend all your money
on that... on that stuff.

1:08:54.431 --> 1:08:57.832
For something
that may not even happen.

1:08:57.834 --> 1:09:01.202
No, you?
You only think about tomorrow

1:09:01.605 --> 1:09:04.973
when I'm here.
I'm here right now.

1:09:07.444 --> 1:09:09.844
And all I think about is you.

1:09:15.018 --> 1:09:16.417
[door opens]

1:09:16.920 --> 1:09:18.720
I came as fast as I could...

1:09:30.000 --> 1:09:31.332
Dad...

1:09:36.873 --> 1:09:39.007
[Ronnie sobbing]

1:10:32.929 --> 1:10:34.562
[sighs]

1:11:38.962 --> 1:11:40.395
You know,

1:11:40.397 --> 1:11:42.363
you're the smartest man I know.

1:11:44.467 --> 1:11:46.868
No, I'm not.
I'm an asshole.

1:11:51.308 --> 1:11:52.874
But I'm getting better.

1:12:21.504 --> 1:12:22.937
The truck runs good.

1:12:24.507 --> 1:12:25.940
Well, it's a Ford.

1:12:30.280 --> 1:12:31.779
Thanks for picking it up.

1:12:35.819 --> 1:12:38.052
Ronnie seems like
a really great lady.

1:12:41.024 --> 1:12:43.524
Yeah. Pretty great.

1:12:49.065 --> 1:12:50.631
Well--
You got a minute?

1:12:52.469 --> 1:12:54.602
[Ed strains, grunts]

1:13:02.078 --> 1:13:03.544
[breathes heavily]

1:13:04.481 --> 1:13:06.114
[groans] Follow me.

1:13:14.991 --> 1:13:16.457
[sighs]

1:13:21.998 --> 1:13:23.231
What do you see?

1:13:25.101 --> 1:13:26.567
Nothing.

1:13:27.771 --> 1:13:28.936
Exactly.

1:13:48.425 --> 1:13:49.824
See it now?

1:14:01.771 --> 1:14:03.838
[door creaks, shuts]

1:14:07.243 --> 1:14:10.278
So, this is where
all your money goes.

1:14:13.216 --> 1:14:14.615
So?

1:14:18.054 --> 1:14:19.520
What do you think?

1:14:22.392 --> 1:14:23.858
Honestly...

1:14:25.462 --> 1:14:26.994
I'm not sure.

1:14:27.564 --> 1:14:29.030
Well, you can tell me.

1:14:31.134 --> 1:14:32.300
Crazy, right?

1:14:32.302 --> 1:14:33.801
Look, Dad, I don't--

1:14:33.803 --> 1:14:37.738
Well, sometimes, crazy times
call for crazy people.

1:14:41.244 --> 1:14:45.046
You know, Dad...
I don't think you're crazy.

1:14:46.483 --> 1:14:48.716
Okay, maybe a little.

1:14:50.153 --> 1:14:53.554
But I think you have to do
what makes you happy.

1:14:54.324 --> 1:14:58.326
I meant... I think,
that's all any of us can do.

1:15:00.029 --> 1:15:03.431
I mean, if this is what
makes you happy,

1:15:03.433 --> 1:15:08.236
and you're not hurting anyone,
I say, hey, what the hell,
go for it.

1:15:10.540 --> 1:15:12.073
And that's what you think?

1:15:13.510 --> 1:15:15.009
That's what I think.

1:15:21.017 --> 1:15:23.084
[sobbing]

1:15:26.155 --> 1:15:27.255
Hey, Dad?

1:15:29.792 --> 1:15:31.225
Are you okay?

1:15:31.694 --> 1:15:33.127
Holy shit.

1:15:40.670 --> 1:15:44.138
I am happy. [laughs]

1:15:45.041 --> 1:15:46.607
[sighs]

1:16:09.098 --> 1:16:10.965
[doorbell rings]

1:16:32.956 --> 1:16:34.255
[sighs]

1:17:04.220 --> 1:17:06.053
You're my BFF.

1:18:08.618 --> 1:18:10.451
I saw a sign today.

1:18:12.488 --> 1:18:14.121
A sign?

1:18:16.292 --> 1:18:17.425
From God?

1:18:18.961 --> 1:18:20.428
Well, I don't know.

1:18:22.999 --> 1:18:24.865
It said, "yard sale."

1:18:25.635 --> 1:18:27.134
"Yard sale"?

1:18:30.873 --> 1:18:33.574
Not to get metaphysical
or anything,

1:18:33.576 --> 1:18:36.243
but I had an inspiration.

1:18:37.847 --> 1:18:42.950
And it does feel
kind of... divine.

1:18:43.820 --> 1:18:45.119
Divine?

1:18:45.855 --> 1:18:47.121
Well.

1:18:48.057 --> 1:18:49.924
I was thinking...

1:18:52.061 --> 1:18:55.463
[sighs] maybe if we had
a yard sale.

1:18:56.399 --> 1:18:58.132
My stuff and yours.

1:19:00.336 --> 1:19:02.103
We could make
a weekend of it.

1:19:02.705 --> 1:19:05.906
I did some research.
People can make
a lot of money.

1:19:05.908 --> 1:19:10.845
But even if we don't,
I have a feeling.

1:19:13.082 --> 1:19:17.818
What happened when you were
in the hospital?

1:19:19.589 --> 1:19:21.188
What happened?

1:19:22.592 --> 1:19:25.159
Did you see the light?

1:19:26.562 --> 1:19:28.162
The light?
You know.

1:19:29.298 --> 1:19:30.498
The light.

1:19:32.101 --> 1:19:34.502
I don't--
I don't think so.

1:19:35.471 --> 1:19:37.271
I just have a feeling.

1:19:39.776 --> 1:19:41.842
I don't mean to upset you.

1:19:44.380 --> 1:19:46.213
I'm not upset.

1:19:46.749 --> 1:19:48.382
Well, you sound upset.

1:19:49.786 --> 1:19:51.352
I'm not upset.

1:19:53.422 --> 1:19:57.992
It's just I--
I had a feeling, too.

1:20:00.296 --> 1:20:05.232
Maybe it's not divine
like you, but...

1:20:07.136 --> 1:20:09.136
I have a feeling, too.

1:20:19.315 --> 1:20:22.082
[man on TV, indistinct]
[Ed] Oh, not him.

1:20:22.752 --> 1:20:23.951
[man #2 on TV, indistinct]

1:20:23.953 --> 1:20:25.653
[grunts]

1:20:25.655 --> 1:20:27.321
Oh, I love her.

1:20:27.323 --> 1:20:29.123
<i> ...and then, they</i>
<i> were off to Florence.</i>

1:20:29.125 --> 1:20:31.192
She always looks so classy.

1:20:31.828 --> 1:20:34.628
[newscaster on TV]
<i> There were TVs on the train,</i>
<i> there were diplomats,</i>

1:20:34.630 --> 1:20:36.997
<i> there were Americans,</i>
<i> there were Parisians,</i>

1:20:36.999 --> 1:20:39.567
<i> there were Syrian refugees.</i>

1:20:39.936 --> 1:20:41.735
<i> Everyone traveled together</i>

1:20:42.171 --> 1:20:45.239

1:20:45.942 --> 1:20:48.275
Why? That's interesting.

1:20:48.277 --> 1:20:51.478
I thought you always say
we should keep up
on current events.

1:20:51.480 --> 1:20:53.848
Current events?
You want current events?

1:20:54.217 --> 1:20:57.251
Well, you're not gonna
find it there.
That woman is a liar.

1:20:58.721 --> 1:21:04.225
A lying, dishonest, disloyal,
opportunistic liar...

1:21:04.227 --> 1:21:07.161
[Ronnie] Huh.
...that one day will realize
what she did.

1:21:07.163 --> 1:21:09.196
And then, she'll regret it,
I can promise you that.

1:21:09.198 --> 1:21:12.199
Why do you say that?
You don't even know her.

1:21:12.201 --> 1:21:14.435
[laughs]
Oh, I know her, all right.

1:21:17.073 --> 1:21:18.706
She's my ex-wife.

1:21:20.543 --> 1:21:21.775
Your wife?

1:21:22.478 --> 1:21:26.313
[Ed] My ex-wife.
She left a long time ago.

1:21:26.315 --> 1:21:29.149
[grunting] Nineteen years.

1:21:29.552 --> 1:21:32.152
What, she's--
she's Brian's mother?

1:21:32.722 --> 1:21:34.088
[chuckles] Yeah.

1:21:34.657 --> 1:21:36.090
He's a genuine son of a bitch.

1:21:36.092 --> 1:21:39.226
Ed. Don't talk like that.

1:21:39.228 --> 1:21:40.327
Funny.

1:21:40.930 --> 1:21:43.964
[sighs] I still
watch her every day.

1:21:46.369 --> 1:21:50.671
She'll always
mean something to you.
It's okay.

1:21:52.008 --> 1:21:53.474
[sighs]

1:21:56.746 --> 1:21:58.178
Sunday.

1:21:58.614 --> 1:22:02.116
It's the best day
for a yard sale.
I looked it up.

1:22:03.386 --> 1:22:06.654
This Sunday?
Yeah. It's as good
as any Sunday.

1:22:08.090 --> 1:22:09.590
But what about...

1:22:11.460 --> 1:22:12.660
It's time.

1:22:15.097 --> 1:22:16.430
You know...

1:22:17.433 --> 1:22:21.635
we can start organizing
your stuff on Tuesday.

1:22:22.305 --> 1:22:24.171
If it's okay with you.

1:22:26.943 --> 1:22:28.809
What do you do
if your boyfriend

1:22:28.811 --> 1:22:33.147
who you really,
really care about
wants you to do something...

1:22:35.284 --> 1:22:37.985
that you just feel
uncomfortable about?

1:22:38.487 --> 1:22:41.355
I'd have to say it depends.
How bad is it?

1:22:43.125 --> 1:22:44.491
Well...

1:22:46.262 --> 1:22:48.462
Well, now I really
want to know what it is.

1:22:50.633 --> 1:22:52.032
Forget it.

1:22:55.938 --> 1:23:00.674
Never let a man
make you do something
you don't want to do.

1:24:17.686 --> 1:24:20.254
-Why don't you answer my calls?
-I'm working.

1:24:20.256 --> 1:24:22.222
I know you're working.
I can see you're working.

1:24:22.224 --> 1:24:23.690
Why don't you answer my calls?

1:24:23.692 --> 1:24:25.893
[Ronnie] Please, not here.
Yes, here.

1:24:25.895 --> 1:24:27.995
You won't come to
me, I have to come to you.

1:24:27.997 --> 1:24:29.363
[whispers]
You don't understand.

1:24:29.365 --> 1:24:30.531
Then explain it to me.

1:24:30.533 --> 1:24:32.699
No, I can't explain it to you.

1:24:32.701 --> 1:24:37.271
Even if I could,
you wouldn't understand.
I don't understand.

1:24:37.273 --> 1:24:39.173
You said
you would do it with me.

1:24:39.175 --> 1:24:41.108
I didn't say
I would do it with you.

1:24:41.110 --> 1:24:43.310
-You did!
-Keep you voice down.

1:24:45.081 --> 1:24:47.681
Why is it so important to you
what I do?

1:24:47.683 --> 1:24:49.917
Because it's what
we talked about.
It's for us.

1:24:49.919 --> 1:24:51.418
No, it's for you.

1:24:51.420 --> 1:24:54.721
I'm fine where I am.
I'm good where I am.

1:24:54.723 --> 1:24:56.423
No, you're not.

1:24:56.425 --> 1:25:00.928
[gasping] Don't you presume
to tell me about me, Ed Hemsler.

1:25:00.930 --> 1:25:05.132
I am a grown woman,
and I don't have to
listen to you.

1:25:05.134 --> 1:25:06.700
I didn't say
you had to listen to me.

1:25:06.702 --> 1:25:08.235
Just get out.
Now, just a minute.

1:25:08.237 --> 1:25:10.170
-Get out!
-Is there a problem?

1:25:10.940 --> 1:25:13.640
Well, there's no problem.
Ed was just leaving.

1:25:17.880 --> 1:25:19.713
I thought this was for real.

1:26:16.005 --> 1:26:20.007
<i>that I really opened up about</i>

1:26:20.009 --> 1:26:21.308
<i> All the door-slamming.</i>

1:26:21.310 --> 1:26:23.043
<i> Like, that was your last word,</i>

1:26:25.181 --> 1:26:27.347

1:26:37.193 --> 1:26:39.026

1:26:40.696 --> 1:26:43.463
<i>but really, you're not losing,</i>
<i>you're gaining.</i>

1:26:45.234 --> 1:26:47.034
Or at least,
that's what you taught me.

1:26:50.973 --> 1:26:52.539
I taught you that?

1:26:54.543 --> 1:26:56.476
Well, not in so many words.

1:26:57.913 --> 1:26:59.379

How much is this?

1:30:23.585 --> 1:30:24.851
That depends.

1:30:26.221 --> 1:30:27.954
How much is it worth to you?

1:30:29.258 --> 1:30:31.992
Oh... Not as much as I thought.

1:30:34.963 --> 1:30:39.766
Well, maybe somebody else
might need it more than you.

1:30:40.636 --> 1:30:45.672
Yeah, maybe. You never know
when you might need
a pretty jar.
