WEBVTT

00:00.601 --> 00:02.601
(helicopter whirl)

00:02.603 --> 00:06.138
(Chorus)
â™ª The Simpsons â™ª

00:09.610 --> 00:11.477
(exclaiming)

00:16.417 --> 00:18.917
(school bell ringing)

00:20.521 --> 00:21.920
(Barney belches)

00:22.890 --> 00:24.156
(whistle blows)

00:24.158 --> 00:25.591
(yells)

00:29.830 --> 00:31.597
(beeping)

00:36.470 --> 00:38.704
(playing the blues)

00:39.573 --> 00:43.142
(playing the blues)

00:43.144 --> 00:45.844
(tires screeching)

00:46.614 --> 00:47.112
D'oh!

00:47.114 --> 00:49.248
(tires screeching)

00:49.250 --> 00:50.349
(grunts)

01:44.171 --> 01:45.170
(groaning)

01:45.172 --> 01:49.141
I don't even want to smell
sparkling apple juice again.

01:49.143 --> 01:51.410
Aw. Poor baby.

01:54.115 --> 01:55.214
Come on, Bart.

01:55.216 --> 01:57.282
Afraid of a little
apple juice?

01:57.284 --> 01:58.484
(laughing)

01:58.486 --> 02:00.152
Pig in a blanket!
Dad's underwear.

02:00.154 --> 02:01.887
Aunt Selma's leg.

02:01.889 --> 02:03.989
I hate New Year's Eve.

02:03.991 --> 02:05.457
I can't believe I made out

02:05.459 --> 02:08.660
with Ryan Seacrest
on the TV screen.

02:08.662 --> 02:09.595
(raspy groan)

02:09.597 --> 02:11.130
Let's just
take it easy.

02:11.132 --> 02:15.167
We all made mistakes
on New Year's Eve.

02:18.272 --> 02:21.306
There's only one
upside to today.

02:21.308 --> 02:22.774
(snoring)

02:22.776 --> 02:25.244
Come on,
just one more drink, Marge.

02:25.246 --> 02:27.346
BOTH:
Happy New Year!

02:27.348 --> 02:29.214
Aah!
(noisemakers blaring)

02:29.216 --> 02:31.884
MARGE:
Everyone shush!

02:31.886 --> 02:32.985
Why are you hungover?

02:32.987 --> 02:34.920
I didn't see you drink
last night.

02:34.922 --> 02:35.387
I didn't.

02:35.389 --> 02:38.490
I got secondhand wasted
from smooching your father.

02:38.492 --> 02:42.561
So not a peep out of anyone
till the Fiesta Bowl.

02:42.563 --> 02:43.929
That's not
for five hours.

02:43.931 --> 02:46.698
I know when the freaking
Fiesta Bowl is!

02:46.700 --> 02:47.933
Sweetie, relax.

02:47.935 --> 02:50.469
Let's just watch some TV.

02:50.471 --> 02:51.637
(drums pounding)

02:51.639 --> 02:52.471
New Year's Eve might be over

02:52.473 --> 02:56.909
in America, but we're still
rocking hard in Samoa.

02:56.911 --> 02:58.443
And here come the Blue Angels

02:58.445 --> 03:01.446
waking up the shrieking
wah-wah birds.

03:01.448 --> 03:02.648
(jet engines roaring)

03:02.650 --> 03:05.884
(raucous squawking)

03:12.693 --> 03:14.426
(siren whoops)

03:14.428 --> 03:15.227
Well, well, well.

03:15.229 --> 03:16.495
Simpson, you've committed

03:16.497 --> 03:19.097
Springfield's first
crime of the new year.

03:19.099 --> 03:20.566
Write him up, Lou.

03:20.568 --> 03:21.833
Huh? What'd I do?

03:21.835 --> 03:23.035
Failed to separate

03:23.037 --> 03:25.938
your bottles
and newspapers.

03:25.940 --> 03:26.905
50 bucks?!

03:26.907 --> 03:29.308
That used to cover
two public nudities

03:29.310 --> 03:31.610
and a poop in the park.
(grumbles)

03:31.612 --> 03:34.413
Aah! That's vandalizing
city property.

03:34.415 --> 03:36.348
Write him up
again, Lou.

03:36.350 --> 03:40.085
What the hell?!
Mild obscenity
before 10:00 a.m.

03:40.087 --> 03:40.786
Also illegal.

03:40.788 --> 03:42.487
Come on, Lou.
Give me a break.

03:42.489 --> 03:44.723
Sorry, sir.
I take no pleasure in it.

03:44.725 --> 03:47.392
â™ª Da-da-da, dee,
da-da-da, da-hah â™ª

03:47.394 --> 03:48.894
Oh, yeah.

03:49.563 --> 03:52.431
Since when is all this
against the law?

03:52.433 --> 03:53.265
Since today.

03:53.267 --> 03:55.834
As of Jan one,
a bunch of new ordinances--

03:55.836 --> 03:59.972
with, uh, outrageous financial
penalties-- took effect.

03:59.974 --> 04:01.006
Oh, I get it.

04:01.008 --> 04:02.574
The government runs out
of money,

04:02.576 --> 04:04.443
so they pass a bunch
of lame-o laws

04:04.445 --> 04:05.978
to sock it to the little guy.

04:05.980 --> 04:07.913
Fine. You're telling
it like it is.

04:07.915 --> 04:09.248
Also a crime now.

04:09.250 --> 04:11.216
And that one's
going to cost you.

04:11.986 --> 04:13.018
(Homer wails)

04:13.020 --> 04:14.786
That's almost $1,000!

04:14.788 --> 04:17.856
Rounding up your total--
that's a $50 fine.

04:17.858 --> 04:19.491
(whimpers)

04:19.727 --> 04:22.294
Wow, Homer.
This year's only 11 hours old,

04:22.296 --> 04:24.496
and it's already
your annus horribilis.

04:24.498 --> 04:26.865
My New Year's resolution
was to learn Latin.

04:26.867 --> 04:30.469
Uh, listen, Homer--
I know a guy who fixes things

04:30.471 --> 04:32.304
for folks who need
things fixed.

04:32.306 --> 04:35.674
But, uh, I can't talk
about it here.

04:37.878 --> 04:39.811
Eh, still not private enough.

04:39.813 --> 04:42.981
Uh, this is private,
but a little dank.

04:43.917 --> 04:45.817
Uh, whoopsie.

04:46.387 --> 04:49.388
Glinda, Madame Morrible,
flying monkeys there,

04:49.390 --> 04:51.757
can you tell me how I can
get back to my bar?

04:51.759 --> 04:57.029
Moe, you've always had the
power to get back to the bar.

04:58.599 --> 05:01.466
Whoa! It's a chimpan-me.

05:16.884 --> 05:20.719
Maybe we should let these
people enjoy their show.

05:25.159 --> 05:25.857
Homer, what you do

05:25.859 --> 05:28.527
is go down to window
nine at the courthouse.

05:28.529 --> 05:30.095
You slip the
guy 100 bucks,

05:30.097 --> 05:31.963
and your record
is as clean as...

05:31.965 --> 05:36.568
Uh, I ain't got nothing,
uh, clean to compare it to.

05:39.340 --> 05:40.672
(groans) Ten minutes?

05:40.674 --> 05:41.940
I can't wait that long.

05:41.942 --> 05:45.210
I left an ice cream cone
in my cup holder.

05:45.512 --> 05:47.979
(grunts)
Hold on. I will get help.

05:47.981 --> 05:50.782
Must break glass.

05:51.118 --> 05:53.585
(grunting)

05:56.957 --> 05:59.524
No!

06:01.462 --> 06:02.527
(chuckling)

06:02.529 --> 06:03.428
(guns cocking)

06:03.430 --> 06:05.430
Homer Simpson, you
are under arrest

06:05.432 --> 06:08.200
for attempted bribery
of a public official.

06:08.202 --> 06:12.304
Chief, this is just
a big misunderstanding.

06:12.306 --> 06:14.406
I meant to write "bride."

06:14.408 --> 06:16.475
It's a wedding
present.

06:16.477 --> 06:18.009
Oh, how thoughtful.

06:18.011 --> 06:19.644
Aah! My bribe!

06:19.646 --> 06:21.546
Cuff him, Lou.

06:22.750 --> 06:26.418
Oh, this is supposed to be
the happiest day of my life,

06:26.420 --> 06:27.853
and it's ruined.

06:27.855 --> 06:30.389
Homer Simpson, you
are hereby sentenced

06:30.391 --> 06:33.792
to ten years
in the federal penitentiary.

06:33.794 --> 06:34.760
It's okay. It's okay.

06:34.762 --> 06:37.729
I can be out in 18 months
with good behavior.

06:37.731 --> 06:38.864
We're Simpsons, Dad.

06:38.866 --> 06:40.165
We don't do
good behavior.

06:40.167 --> 06:43.201
Don't tell me I'm not capable
of good behavior!

06:43.203 --> 06:46.705
(gagging)
(angry shouting)

06:47.574 --> 06:51.143
Your Honor, I would like
to request a sidebar.

06:51.145 --> 06:52.611
Granted.

06:52.613 --> 06:53.879
(grunting)

06:53.881 --> 06:56.148
(screaming)

07:00.888 --> 07:02.521
CHIEF WIGGUM:
Ten years.

07:02.523 --> 07:03.221
(clicking tongue)

07:03.223 --> 07:05.891
That is a long time to be
away from your family.

07:05.893 --> 07:10.162
All that time I'll be stuck
in my cell, unable to exercise.

07:10.164 --> 07:13.098
Actually, most convicts
work out like crazy.

07:13.100 --> 07:16.134
I repeat: unable to exercise.

07:16.136 --> 07:18.036
Look, Simpson,
there is one thing

07:18.038 --> 07:19.905
you can do
to get out sooner,

07:19.907 --> 07:23.408
but, uh, it is
extremely dangerous.

07:23.911 --> 07:25.744
Simpson, we are
currently conducting

07:25.746 --> 07:26.645
a 20-year investigation

07:26.647 --> 07:30.615
into the activities of
Anthony "Fat Tony" D'Amico.

07:30.617 --> 07:32.851
What, this guy?

07:35.322 --> 07:36.421
Oops.

07:37.491 --> 07:38.323
(wry laugh)

07:38.325 --> 07:38.857
We're going to plant you

07:38.859 --> 07:41.960
in Fat Tony's gang
as an undercover informant.

07:41.962 --> 07:44.563
I can't go undercover
with Fat Tony.

07:44.565 --> 07:45.497
He's met me.

07:45.499 --> 07:46.465
I've been in his house.

07:46.467 --> 07:49.000
I was briefly
his "conserigliary..."

07:49.002 --> 07:53.138
consugly... canoliar...
Robert Duvall.

07:53.140 --> 07:55.774
Everyone knows Fat Tony,
so we're going to plant you

07:55.776 --> 07:58.677
in the prison with a
disguise and a new name.

07:58.679 --> 08:00.178
Can I be Johnny Undercover?

08:00.180 --> 08:01.580
That's a little obvious.

08:01.582 --> 08:03.248
Okay. Melvin Mafia.

08:03.250 --> 08:04.549
No. You will be known

08:04.551 --> 08:07.052
as Nicky "Blue Pants"
Altosaxophony.

08:07.054 --> 08:08.787
Can I keep the name
after I'm done?

08:08.789 --> 08:10.589
No. It belongs to
the government.
Oh.

08:10.591 --> 08:13.024
MAN (over P.A.):
No ice cream available!

08:13.026 --> 08:14.259
Children, stay away!

08:14.261 --> 08:15.727
(disappointed groans)

08:15.729 --> 08:17.128
(coos with admiration)

08:17.130 --> 08:18.663
Now, pay attention.

08:18.665 --> 08:19.731
We're going to move
in on Fat Tony

08:19.733 --> 08:22.200
when he takes delivery on a
shipment of Belgian guns.

08:22.202 --> 08:24.569
In your left sideburn
is a fiber-optic camera.

08:24.571 --> 08:26.705
In your right,
a wireless mic.

08:26.707 --> 08:28.640
To zoom in, you go, "Ayyy!"

08:28.642 --> 08:31.109
To zoom out, go, "Ohhh!"

08:31.111 --> 08:36.081
Ayyy. Ohhh! Ayyy. Ohhh!

08:36.083 --> 08:36.982
Fuhgetaboutit!

08:36.984 --> 08:38.984
That activates
the auto-destruct.

08:38.986 --> 08:40.719
(howling, hooting)

08:40.721 --> 08:44.456
Dear Lord, watch over
my sweet Homie

08:44.458 --> 08:45.857
while he's in
the hoosegow.

08:45.859 --> 08:47.559
Keep him safe
from shanks and shivs.

08:47.561 --> 08:50.428
Let him become rich
in the jail yard currencies

08:50.430 --> 08:52.697
of cigarettes and dried fish.

08:58.739 --> 09:00.906
Uh, what's my
name again?

09:00.908 --> 09:02.207
Okay, I'm coming.

09:02.209 --> 09:03.308
(inmate shrieks)

09:03.310 --> 09:04.776
I'd like a third
helping, please.

09:04.778 --> 09:08.713
You do know the meat is made
from diseased pigeons.

09:08.715 --> 09:10.682
Just get the ladle
down there deep.

09:10.684 --> 09:13.051
That's where
the beaks are.

09:15.088 --> 09:18.089
Hey, you're that guy
from the FB-- mmph!

09:18.091 --> 09:19.291
Time to go to work.

09:19.293 --> 09:21.026
Stop licking my hand.

09:21.028 --> 09:22.961
There was
barbecue sauce on it.

09:22.963 --> 09:25.263
Here's how it goes down:
I rough up Louie.

09:25.265 --> 09:27.065
Then you stand up to me,
earning his trust.

09:27.067 --> 09:30.802
But I haven't earned his trust
if it's based on a lie.

09:30.804 --> 09:33.204
Enough of your
dime-store morality.

09:33.206 --> 09:34.272
What's a dime store?

09:34.274 --> 09:36.274
I... (groans)

09:38.145 --> 09:40.378
Aah!
(guards laughing)

09:40.380 --> 09:42.347
Blue pants power!

09:42.349 --> 09:43.114
Ow! Hey.

09:43.116 --> 09:45.750
Hey, Nicky Blue,
you're one tough yegg.

09:45.752 --> 09:48.320
If you come out of your
beating in one piece,

09:48.322 --> 09:50.722
you and I should
have a face-to-face.

09:50.724 --> 09:52.290
Beating? What beating?

09:52.292 --> 09:53.658
(gasps)

09:53.660 --> 09:55.660
Oh, that beating.

09:58.065 --> 09:59.898
Don't worry. We're not
going to touch you.

09:59.900 --> 10:01.333
We'll make it sound
like a beating

10:01.335 --> 10:03.201
by tenderizing
these steaks.

10:03.203 --> 10:05.270
Can I have any of the steaks?

10:05.272 --> 10:06.638
No.

10:06.640 --> 10:09.307
(screaming)

10:11.845 --> 10:12.944
HOMER:
That's so mean!

10:12.946 --> 10:17.082
Whoa! I'm impressed over here
with that guy over there.

10:17.084 --> 10:19.084
Please! Let me have it!

10:19.086 --> 10:20.719
(agonized yelling)

10:20.721 --> 10:21.186
Come on!

10:21.188 --> 10:23.655
Give it to me
right in the mouth!

10:23.657 --> 10:26.758
(Homer wails)

10:30.230 --> 10:31.229
(sighs)

10:31.231 --> 10:34.966
Well, back in my keister you go.

10:34.968 --> 10:37.702
We brought someone
to spring you.

10:37.704 --> 10:41.072
Now, let us escort
you to freedom.

10:41.074 --> 10:42.240
How are you going to do that?

10:42.242 --> 10:43.875
Let's just say this prison

10:43.877 --> 10:47.979
was built
by Mob construction workers.

10:56.790 --> 10:57.322
He's in.

10:57.324 --> 10:59.824
Aw, for-- I was
going to say that!

11:00.827 --> 11:01.326
What's going on?

11:01.328 --> 11:04.496
I called the prison and they
won't tell me where Homer is.

11:04.498 --> 11:07.032
Sorry, Marge,
I can't tell you.
(sighs)

11:07.034 --> 11:09.434
If it makes you feel better, I
can tell you about someone else.

11:09.436 --> 11:13.004
Ooh! How about Krusty
in the drunk tank? Aha.

11:13.006 --> 11:16.074
(slurring):
If, if Jews control the media,

11:16.076 --> 11:20.879
why can't I get on
Jimmy Kimmel, huh? Huh?

11:20.881 --> 11:22.714
(frustrated groan)

11:26.420 --> 11:29.054
So. What do you think
of the sauce?

11:29.056 --> 11:33.692
I detect a distinct
lack of oregano.

11:33.694 --> 11:36.294
I'll take care of this.

11:37.931 --> 11:39.898
You carry oregano with you?

11:39.900 --> 11:42.867
Oregano, basil,
rosemary...

11:42.869 --> 11:45.003
I-I think I got a ketchup
packet for you, boss.

11:45.005 --> 11:47.439
Did you order French fries
and not use it?

11:47.441 --> 11:50.442
Well, they gave me two packets,
but I only needed one.

11:50.444 --> 11:54.079
What other secrets
are you hiding from me?

11:54.081 --> 11:57.949
I-I-I bring my own candy
to the movie theater.

11:57.951 --> 12:00.285
Louie...

12:07.027 --> 12:09.027
My beloved Anna Maria.

12:09.029 --> 12:12.997
I hope Heaven's powder room
is painted that eggshell blue

12:12.999 --> 12:16.968
(cell phone buzzing)
you could never
achieve on Earth.

12:18.972 --> 12:21.172
(sniffs)

12:21.174 --> 12:22.907
(snuffling):
Sorry, boss.

12:22.909 --> 12:25.076
No apology necessary.

12:25.078 --> 12:26.511
I am touched.

12:26.513 --> 12:28.913
You and me, Nicky.
We feel.

12:28.915 --> 12:33.485
Legs, Louie, Jimmy the Axe,
Tommy the Face-Shooter--

12:33.487 --> 12:35.186
they never share my grief.

12:35.188 --> 12:39.357
(scoffs) Yeah. Those guys are
probably FBI informants.

12:39.359 --> 12:42.994
You think an informant
could get that close to me?

12:42.996 --> 12:43.394
Oh, yeah.

12:43.396 --> 12:46.164
I got in your gang, and you
barely know who I am.

12:46.166 --> 12:48.399
That is good
counsel indeed.

12:48.401 --> 12:51.903
You have earned my complete,
unquestioning trust.

12:51.905 --> 12:54.372
But first,
one little thing.

12:54.374 --> 12:58.076
You must make your bones.

12:58.478 --> 13:00.912
Wh-What are
we doing here?

13:00.914 --> 13:02.380
I will tell you.

13:02.883 --> 13:06.718
<i>When I call for my Russian</i>
<i>business partner, Yuri Nator,</i>

13:06.720 --> 13:08.086
<i>I don't expect</i>
<i>to be screamed at</i>

13:08.088 --> 13:12.223
<i>like I was some ten-year-old</i>
<i>punk making a prank call.</i>

13:12.225 --> 13:14.425
Yuri Nator?
Yuri Nator!

13:14.427 --> 13:17.962
Hey, my mouth is begging
for a Yuri Nator!

13:17.964 --> 13:19.164
(laughing)

13:19.166 --> 13:20.899
Be careful what
you wish for.

13:20.901 --> 13:23.501
Why, you... I'm going to
chop you into little pieces,

13:23.503 --> 13:25.370
and make you
into a Rubik's cube,

13:25.372 --> 13:28.039
which I will never solve!

13:29.609 --> 13:31.309
Well, I guess
I could tell him

13:31.311 --> 13:33.845
he could improve
his phone etiquette.

13:33.847 --> 13:36.981
Tell him with fire.

13:36.983 --> 13:38.583
(anxiously):
Ooh-hoo.

13:38.585 --> 13:40.285
What's the matter, Nicky?

13:40.287 --> 13:42.453
You got a problem
with this job?

13:42.455 --> 13:44.556
Oh, no, no!
I was, uh, just thinking

13:44.558 --> 13:47.292
how cheap this crime
would've been in the 70's,

13:47.294 --> 13:50.261
when gas was 35 cents a gallon.

14:02.542 --> 14:06.110
It was either this,
or put in a ladies' room.

14:06.112 --> 14:08.446
(sirens approaching)

14:10.450 --> 14:11.216
Exquisite.

14:11.218 --> 14:15.620
As a reward, I've planned
a little surprise for you.

14:15.622 --> 14:15.920
(yells)

14:15.922 --> 14:20.225
This is horrible!
I keep smelling my own breath!

14:20.227 --> 14:21.559
Nicolas Blue Pants,

14:21.561 --> 14:23.428
you have shown
great fazagabool

14:23.430 --> 14:28.132
in the face of overwhelming
spoogatzagatini.

14:28.134 --> 14:29.901
Huh?

14:33.106 --> 14:35.940
You're a made man,
my friend.
Welcome!

14:35.942 --> 14:37.475
Ooh...

14:38.178 --> 14:40.178
Nicky, welcome to
the family.

14:40.180 --> 14:44.082
From now on, you don't know
where you end and we begin.

14:44.084 --> 14:46.651
Your problems
are our problems.

14:46.653 --> 14:48.386
My neck is kind of itchy.

14:48.388 --> 14:49.988
Then all of our necks are itchy.

14:49.990 --> 14:53.358
Now that you mention it,
itchy like crazy!
I gotta shave my back.

14:53.360 --> 14:55.126
Aw.

14:57.130 --> 14:58.263
Nicky, my friend,

14:58.265 --> 15:02.233
tonight is a big score I've
been setting up for months.

15:04.704 --> 15:07.005
<i>Just you and me.</i>

15:07.007 --> 15:08.573
Sharing it together.

15:08.575 --> 15:11.175
To heterosexual
male friendship,

15:11.177 --> 15:14.279
the kind the Greeks
wrote about.

15:14.281 --> 15:15.413
(foghorn blares)

15:15.415 --> 15:17.048
Huh?

15:18.084 --> 15:20.485
Here they are!
My Belgian guns.

15:20.487 --> 15:24.022
Belgian guns. I've been waiting
half my life for this moment.

15:24.024 --> 15:25.523
SUPERVISOR (over radio):
All units, move in!

15:25.525 --> 15:27.692
Tony, you got to get
out of here, now!

15:27.694 --> 15:28.426
What? Why?

15:28.428 --> 15:30.128
Don't ask questions, just go!

15:30.130 --> 15:32.664
What's gotten into you?
You're as nervous as a cat

15:32.666 --> 15:35.633
when Johnny Kick-A-Cat
walks into the room.

15:35.635 --> 15:37.101
<i>Verlaat de vuurwapens</i>

15:37.103 --> 15:40.872
<i>op het dok En wij kunnen</i>
<i>een Chimay bier drinken!</i>

15:40.874 --> 15:42.540
Get a shot of
Tony with the guns.

15:42.542 --> 15:43.574
(nervously):
Um, eh...

15:43.576 --> 15:44.709
FBI SUPERVISOR (over radio):
Closer.

15:44.711 --> 15:47.312
Ayyy...
FBI SUPERVISOR:
Too close.

15:47.314 --> 15:48.980
Ohhh!
Closer.

15:48.982 --> 15:50.615
Ayyy.

15:51.351 --> 15:53.151
Too close.
HOMER:
Ohhh!

15:53.153 --> 15:53.885
Perfect.

15:53.887 --> 15:56.254
Wait a minute.

15:58.692 --> 15:59.724
(sirens wailing)

15:59.726 --> 16:01.259
How could you, Nicky?

16:01.261 --> 16:03.461
I would have
given you everything.

16:03.463 --> 16:05.029
In the strip club
of my heart,

16:05.031 --> 16:07.498
you held the key to
the champagne room.

16:07.500 --> 16:09.701
I loved you, man.

16:09.703 --> 16:11.469
(gasps)

16:16.009 --> 16:16.541
He's dead.

16:16.543 --> 16:20.378
No. You're wrong! Check again!

16:20.380 --> 16:21.479
Fuhgetaboutit.

16:42.035 --> 16:42.900
Homer, I just want to say

16:42.902 --> 16:46.104
that of all the rat bastards
we've had working for us,

16:46.106 --> 16:47.238
you were the snitchiest.

16:47.240 --> 16:49.240
So that's it. You
used me to kill a man,

16:49.242 --> 16:51.576
and all I get is a
handshake and a blanket?

16:51.578 --> 16:53.878
We didn't say you
could use the blanket.

16:53.880 --> 16:56.581
And I'm not gonna
shake your hand.

16:56.683 --> 16:59.317
Poor Tony.
He didn't deserve this.

16:59.319 --> 17:04.155
He was just a soldier
in a war he started.

17:04.824 --> 17:06.758
(cooing happily)

17:06.760 --> 17:11.095
Homie, I know you had
a terrible experience,

17:11.097 --> 17:11.763
but it's over.

17:11.765 --> 17:14.766
It's not over, Marge.
It'll never be over.

17:14.768 --> 17:18.269
When I shut my eyes, all I see
is Fat Tony and me

17:18.271 --> 17:20.405
having drinks
at that bar on the beach.

17:20.407 --> 17:23.274
You never took me to
that bar on the beach.

17:23.276 --> 17:25.143
Oh. Well, uh...

17:25.145 --> 17:28.146
you wouldn't like it;
it's not very good.

17:28.148 --> 17:29.480
Sounds pretty good.

17:29.482 --> 17:32.216
No, no, I oversold it.

17:36.156 --> 17:38.222
(thunder rumbles)

17:40.293 --> 17:43.795
I'd give anything
to bring you back.

17:44.364 --> 17:46.464
MALE VOICE:
Wake up, Homer.

17:46.466 --> 17:49.167
HOMER:
Huh? Wha...? (gasps)

17:49.169 --> 17:50.435
Fat Tony.

17:50.437 --> 17:53.771
No. I'm his cousin
from San Diego--

17:53.773 --> 17:55.807
Fit Tony.

17:56.276 --> 18:00.411
Wow, I've never seen a mobster
use a track suit for exercising.

18:00.413 --> 18:05.216
And there's no better exercise
than killing and disemboweling

18:05.218 --> 18:07.685
a big, fat snitch.

18:07.687 --> 18:09.320
I understand.

18:09.322 --> 18:11.255
I loved him too.

18:11.257 --> 18:12.790
(sobbing)

18:14.594 --> 18:18.596
Your tears seem
in no way crocodilian.

18:18.598 --> 18:20.131
Do what you got to do.

18:20.133 --> 18:21.566
The quicker you
kill me up here,

18:21.568 --> 18:24.936
the quicker he can
kill me down there.

18:26.239 --> 18:29.140
Join me on the
elliptical machines.

18:29.142 --> 18:31.209
I will let you live for...

18:31.211 --> 18:34.412
20 minutes.

18:38.718 --> 18:40.418
I worked for Fat Tony.

18:40.420 --> 18:42.620
And he was the best
boss I ever had.

18:42.622 --> 18:44.622
Well. This is awkward.

18:44.624 --> 18:47.191
What? Oh, uh, Mr. Burns!

18:47.193 --> 18:49.393
Uh, you were cool, too.

18:49.395 --> 18:53.164
Oh, I so believe that.

18:53.333 --> 18:57.401
He took me to a fight that
he fixed, but he never let on,

18:57.403 --> 19:01.205
not even when I bet $500
on the wrong guy.

19:01.207 --> 19:01.873
(chuckling)

19:01.875 --> 19:05.176
Then he said he would
dope a horse for me.

19:05.178 --> 19:08.012
Homer, it is time...

19:08.014 --> 19:11.249
to switch your elliptical
machine to cool-down mode.

19:11.251 --> 19:14.485
Are you going to kill me now?
'Cause I'm super ready.

19:14.487 --> 19:18.489
No. Because my cousin
lives on in your memories.

19:18.491 --> 19:19.557
And to extinguish you

19:19.559 --> 19:22.527
would be to whack
what still remains of him.

19:22.529 --> 19:25.930
Wow. The killers
have been kind to me.

19:25.932 --> 19:28.900
While the people who are
supposed to protect me

19:28.902 --> 19:29.901
treated me like dirt!

19:29.903 --> 19:31.736
What kind of
a world is this?

19:31.738 --> 19:32.837
It's pretty screwed-up.

19:32.839 --> 19:35.506
That's why I keep
my friends close.

19:35.508 --> 19:36.874
And your enemies closer?

19:36.876 --> 19:38.209
No, why would I do that?

19:38.211 --> 19:40.912
If they were close,
they would kill me.

19:40.914 --> 19:43.047

<i>Soon, he was known as</i>
