LINDSAY DOLE: <i>Previously</i>
<i>on "The Practice"...</i>

00:02.636 --> 00:04.538
All nine victims had dogs.

00:04.571 --> 00:06.439
Mr. Hinks met all of them

00:06.471 --> 00:09.342
in various parks and streets
while walking his dog.

00:09.375 --> 00:12.278
My opinion is Mr. Hinks
is suffering from delusions.

00:12.312 --> 00:15.315
Basically, he thinks
he killed those women.

00:15.348 --> 00:17.283
We find the defendant
William Hinks

00:17.317 --> 00:19.620
not guilty.

00:19.653 --> 00:22.756
Lindsay, the man
did not kill anybody.

00:22.789 --> 00:24.390
Jeannie, he did.

00:24.424 --> 00:25.626
WILLIAM: Can I vote?

00:25.659 --> 00:27.728
-Aah!
-Aah!

00:27.761 --> 00:29.495
I am issuing
a restraining order

00:29.530 --> 00:32.098
requiring Mr. Hinks
not to contact,

00:32.131 --> 00:35.769
follow, or approach
Ms. Dole and Ms. Hatcher

00:35.802 --> 00:38.371
and to stay at all times

00:38.404 --> 00:42.709
at least 1,000 feet from them,
their homes, and their offices.

00:42.743 --> 00:44.210
"To Lindsay
with affection."

00:45.812 --> 00:47.781
it's a little dog.

00:47.814 --> 00:50.283
Who's sending you a dog?

00:50.316 --> 00:53.453
On count one,
murder in the first degree,

00:53.486 --> 00:57.758
we find the defendant
Scott Wallace not guilty.

00:57.791 --> 00:59.192
He fired me.

00:59.225 --> 01:00.260
-What? Who?
-Harry Duvall.

01:00.293 --> 01:02.395
The employees...

01:02.428 --> 01:03.830
don't want him around.

01:03.864 --> 01:06.499
They don't even want him
in the building.

01:06.533 --> 01:08.301
What about you, Harry?

01:08.334 --> 01:10.504
I don't want you
around, either, Scott.

01:10.537 --> 01:12.338
And whether
you killed Karen or not,

01:12.372 --> 01:14.675
you're just not the same man
I used to know.

01:14.708 --> 01:16.710
Aw, Jesus, Scott!

01:16.743 --> 01:18.178
This is just
the anesthesia.

01:18.211 --> 01:19.445
If you kill yourself,

01:19.479 --> 01:20.881
people are going to say,

01:20.914 --> 01:23.416
"See? He killed her.
He killed himself."

01:23.449 --> 01:26.452
Is that the legacy that you
really want to leave, Scott?

01:26.486 --> 01:27.688
No.

01:34.828 --> 01:39.533
He had this look
on his face --

01:39.566 --> 01:41.868
he just seemed
a little outside of himself.

01:41.902 --> 01:43.203
What do you mean?

01:43.236 --> 01:45.906
I mean something snapped
in this guy.

01:45.939 --> 01:47.641
At first it just seemed

01:47.674 --> 01:49.610
like he was going
to kill himself,

01:49.643 --> 01:52.178
and then he turned the gun
on Duvall,

01:52.212 --> 01:56.182
and he just
started shooting.

01:56.216 --> 02:01.622
I'm just thankful
he didn't shoot me.

02:01.655 --> 02:03.824
You didn't know
he had brought the gun.

02:03.857 --> 02:06.392
Of course not.

02:06.426 --> 02:09.663
JIMMY: He just pulled it out.
I don't even know from where.

02:09.696 --> 02:11.832
What was his demeanor?

02:11.865 --> 02:15.669
Well, he was building
into this rage, you know.

02:15.702 --> 02:18.304
He was building up and up,

02:18.338 --> 02:21.575
and then we thought he was
going to kill himself.

02:21.608 --> 02:25.411
Then a kind of calm
came over him.

02:27.614 --> 02:28.949
Calm in what way?

02:28.982 --> 02:30.851
Well, when Duvall said,

02:30.884 --> 02:32.853
"Don't do it.
Don't kill yourself,"

02:32.886 --> 02:35.488
and Scott said,
"You're absolutely right,"

02:35.522 --> 02:37.490
he said it --

02:37.524 --> 02:41.494
It was with this
evil revenge kind of calm.

02:41.528 --> 02:44.197
That's the best way
I can describe it.

02:44.230 --> 02:46.667
Do you think this was
a revenge killing?

02:46.700 --> 02:47.934
Absolutely.

02:47.968 --> 02:49.770
From your observation,

02:49.803 --> 02:51.805
he knew what he was doing?

02:51.838 --> 02:54.274
Oh, he knew exactly.

02:54.307 --> 02:56.409
This guy didn't snap here.

02:56.442 --> 02:57.678
He made a decision.

02:57.711 --> 02:59.980
He decided to kill
this Duvall guy,

03:00.013 --> 03:01.548
and he did it.

03:01.582 --> 03:04.350
You're sure about that
from your observation.

03:04.384 --> 03:08.555
I'm totally sure.
It was an execution.

03:15.395 --> 03:17.263
â™ª (theme)

04:11.618 --> 04:12.919
Rejected.

04:12.953 --> 04:14.454
Mitchell, I didn't even
tell you the offer.

04:14.487 --> 04:15.522
It doesn't matter, Helen.

04:15.556 --> 04:17.390
That should
tell you something.

04:17.423 --> 04:19.492
Oh, come on. You can't be
expecting to win this.

04:19.526 --> 04:22.062
The guy's sitting in a van
with 100 grams of heroin.

04:22.095 --> 04:24.765
And I keep telling you,
my client is a chemist

04:24.798 --> 04:26.332
whose only mistake
was working so hard

04:26.366 --> 04:28.502
he fell asleep
at the wheel.

04:28.535 --> 04:30.504
He had no idea
those drugs were there.

04:30.537 --> 04:32.038
Mitchell, we used to date.

04:32.072 --> 04:34.407
You forget I could always
tell when you were lying.

04:34.440 --> 04:36.610
But you could never tell
when I wasn't.

04:36.643 --> 04:39.079
I'm not after your client.
I'm after his boss.

04:39.112 --> 04:41.047
All I need is a name.

04:41.081 --> 04:42.448
Helen...

04:42.482 --> 04:44.585
He's facing 15 years.
We're offering 5.

04:44.618 --> 04:45.719
Why would you
turn that down?

04:45.752 --> 04:46.987
Because I'm not
a D. A. anymore.

04:47.020 --> 04:49.590
I'm a defense lawyer.
That's one reason.

04:49.623 --> 04:51.792
The other is
my client is innocent.

04:53.660 --> 04:55.796
What did you have
for breakfast?

04:55.829 --> 04:57.463
Hey, I'm pregnant.

04:57.497 --> 05:00.433
-So am I.
-Me, too.

05:00.466 --> 05:01.935
Is this dog
going to live here now?

05:01.968 --> 05:03.369
His name is Chopper,

05:03.403 --> 05:05.739
and, yeah,
until he gets house trained

05:05.772 --> 05:08.542
and I know that he won't
pee on my carpet.

05:08.575 --> 05:09.543
There.

05:09.576 --> 05:11.845
Jimmy, my office.

05:20.587 --> 05:22.355
What's wrong?

05:22.388 --> 05:23.757
You told the police

05:23.790 --> 05:25.091
that Scott Wallace acted
with premeditation?

05:25.125 --> 05:26.359
He did.

05:26.392 --> 05:27.794
You're his lawyer. How --

05:27.828 --> 05:29.630
Not on this I'm not.
Ellenor and I were witnesses.

05:29.663 --> 05:31.665
And Ellenor correctly said
he snapped.

05:31.698 --> 05:33.399
-I don't agree.
-Whether you --

05:33.433 --> 05:34.801
You weren't there, so how
do you know what's correct?

05:34.835 --> 05:37.037
-I know Scott's mental state.
-I was in the room.

05:37.070 --> 05:38.939
You basically screwed
our insanity defense.

05:38.972 --> 05:40.373
I was in the room.

05:40.406 --> 05:41.742
If there was
even a question --

05:41.775 --> 05:43.744
There wasn't, not to me.
He didn't snap.

05:43.777 --> 05:47.113
He knew exactly what he
was doing. I was a witness.

05:47.147 --> 05:49.015
And I don't appreciate you
telling me

05:49.049 --> 05:50.851
-to ignore the truth...
-I wasn't.

05:50.884 --> 05:53.053
Or feeding me what you think
the truth should be.

05:53.086 --> 05:54.921
I was in the room.

05:54.955 --> 05:57.658
What happened in that room
was the result of many things

05:57.691 --> 05:59.492
that took place before.

05:59.526 --> 06:01.127
I told them what I saw.

06:01.161 --> 06:04.698
All right. Bobby, of course
he should tell the truth.

06:04.731 --> 06:06.432
Well, if you're wrong,
Jimmy,

06:06.466 --> 06:08.969
your mistake could cost
a man a life sentence.

06:14.741 --> 06:16.777
That was way out of line.

06:16.810 --> 06:18.078
Scott Wallace --

06:18.111 --> 06:21.114
I don't care.
You were way out of line.

06:27.487 --> 06:29.089
The front end was up
against a telephone pole

06:29.122 --> 06:30.824
completely smashed.

06:30.857 --> 06:32.826
It was a white van
with the words

06:32.859 --> 06:34.828
"Gray's Pharmaceutical"
on the side.

06:34.861 --> 06:37.097
Officer, did you see anyone
behind the wheel?

06:37.130 --> 06:40.734
Yes. I didn't at first.
His head was kind of hunched,

06:40.767 --> 06:43.637
but as I got closer, I could
see it was the defendant.

06:43.670 --> 06:46.707
How would you describe
the defendant's condition?

06:46.740 --> 06:49.075
He had a deep laceration on
the left side of his forehead.

06:49.109 --> 06:51.745
There was blood on his head
and also on the windshield.

06:51.778 --> 06:53.179
When the ESU arrived,

06:53.213 --> 06:55.481
they transported Mr. Macklin
to the hospital.

06:55.516 --> 06:57.818
Officer, when the defendant
went to the hospital,

06:57.851 --> 06:59.085
what happened to his van?

06:59.119 --> 07:01.121
It was taken
to the police impound yard

07:01.154 --> 07:03.489
where a routine
inventory search was done.

07:03.524 --> 07:05.592
-Were you present
for that search?
-Yes.

07:05.626 --> 07:07.193
Could you tell the jury
what you found?

07:07.227 --> 07:09.830
We found a black bag
containing

07:09.863 --> 07:13.667
what we later determined
to be 115 grams of heroin.

07:13.700 --> 07:16.036
We also recovered
two large barrels,

07:16.069 --> 07:19.606
the first containing several
gallons of phenylacetic acid,

07:19.640 --> 07:23.043
the other with a similar
quantity of methylene.

07:23.076 --> 07:26.580
Officer, do you know what
those chemicals are used for?

07:26.613 --> 07:29.115
Yes, to make a drug
called methamphetamine.

07:29.149 --> 07:31.217
You found those items

07:31.251 --> 07:34.020
-in the rear compartment
of the van.
-That's correct.

07:34.054 --> 07:35.922
There were no drugs found
in the passenger compartment?

07:35.956 --> 07:37.591
We didn't find any.

07:37.624 --> 07:40.226
And you also didn't find any
drugs on my client, did you?

07:40.260 --> 07:41.227
No.

07:41.261 --> 07:42.863
What about fingerprints?

07:42.896 --> 07:44.598
Did you find any
of my client's fingerprints

07:44.631 --> 07:46.232
on the black bag
you mentioned?

07:46.266 --> 07:48.502
No readable prints
were recovered.

07:48.535 --> 07:50.170
Thank you, officer.

07:50.203 --> 07:52.172
Nothing further.

07:52.205 --> 07:54.541
The witness may step down.

07:54.575 --> 07:58.512
We'll break for lunch,
resume at 2:00.

07:58.545 --> 07:59.580
We're adjourned.

08:01.548 --> 08:04.785
I still think
we can resolve this.

08:04.818 --> 08:06.052
Helen --

08:06.086 --> 08:07.654
It's a lot of drugs,

08:07.688 --> 08:10.924
more than any street-level
soldier gets to carry.

08:10.957 --> 08:13.259
Look, our next witness
is going to testify that

08:13.293 --> 08:15.796
he saw your client put the bag
in the van. Why would you --

08:15.829 --> 08:17.998
We're not interested
in your deals.

08:18.031 --> 08:19.800
He's looking at 15 years.

08:19.833 --> 08:22.503
I am beginning
to get angry now.

08:27.240 --> 08:29.843
Commonwealth
vs Scott Wallace,

08:29.876 --> 08:31.645
murder
in the first degree --

08:31.678 --> 08:33.547
Bobby Donnell for
the defendant, your honor.

08:33.580 --> 08:35.215
Waive reading,
enter a plea of not guilty

08:35.248 --> 08:37.116
by reason
of temporary insanity.

08:37.150 --> 08:38.919
Given my client's
mental infirmity,

08:38.952 --> 08:40.186
we would be requesting bail
so that --

08:40.220 --> 08:41.688
Denied.

08:41.722 --> 08:43.957
We'd also be requesting
an early trial date

08:43.990 --> 08:46.026
since Mr. Wallace's continued
deterioration --

08:46.059 --> 08:47.761
Mr. Bay?

08:47.794 --> 08:49.963
I could be ready
in two weeks, your honor.

08:49.996 --> 08:52.232
Trial date in two weeks,
defendant stays in custody.

08:52.265 --> 08:54.701
Your honor,
the court should know

08:54.735 --> 08:57.604
two lawyers from Mr. Donnell's
firm will be witnesses and --

08:57.638 --> 08:59.673
My client is prepared
to waive the conflicts.

08:59.706 --> 09:02.843
Whoa, whoa, just a second.
It's not that simple.

09:02.876 --> 09:05.679
Two of your lawyers
will be witnesses? How so?

09:05.712 --> 09:08.314
They were present
at the shooting.

09:08.348 --> 09:12.352
I want affidavits
from the attorneys,

09:12.385 --> 09:14.287
and I'll hear from you
again on this

09:14.320 --> 09:15.722
before I agree.

09:15.756 --> 09:18.324
I have grave concerns,
Mr. Donnell.

09:18.358 --> 09:20.226
We're in recess.

09:21.895 --> 09:24.130
I will be in to see you
this afternoon.

09:24.164 --> 09:25.632
Again, do not talk
to anybody --

09:25.666 --> 09:26.967
no guards, no inmates.

09:27.000 --> 09:30.671
Wait for me to get there.

09:38.011 --> 09:39.746
Temp insanity?

09:39.780 --> 09:42.649
Are you sure the victim
didn't commit suicide?

09:42.683 --> 09:44.284
You know, Richard,
for such a clever guy,

09:44.317 --> 09:45.919
you should be able
to figure out

09:45.952 --> 09:47.287
why everybody hates you.

09:47.320 --> 09:50.591
I'll carry that remark
with me through the trial.

09:55.195 --> 09:57.163
Who is it that's asking?

09:57.197 --> 09:59.733
I'm not sure, ma'am --
One of the prisoners.

09:59.766 --> 10:01.635
This is how stupid
they're getting.

10:01.668 --> 10:04.204
They're asking
to see prosecutors.

10:04.237 --> 10:06.206
Right through here.

10:06.239 --> 10:07.674
Ms. Gamble.

10:07.708 --> 10:10.944
Oh, Mr. Macklin,
I can't speak to you.

10:10.977 --> 10:12.913
You're represented
by counsel.

10:12.946 --> 10:14.047
No, I'm not.

10:14.080 --> 10:15.949
Did you fire Mr. Reese?

10:15.982 --> 10:18.318
I can't fire him, Ms. Gamble.
He works for them.

10:18.351 --> 10:21.187
The people I work for,
he works for.

10:21.221 --> 10:22.923
Hold on, I can't --

10:22.956 --> 10:24.691
I want to plead.

10:24.725 --> 10:26.693
Mr. Macklin,
you have counsel --

10:26.727 --> 10:28.328
No, I don't,

10:28.361 --> 10:30.330
and if you tell Mr. Reese

10:30.363 --> 10:31.965
that we had
this conversation,

10:31.998 --> 10:33.333
I'll be killed,

10:33.366 --> 10:35.836
my whole family will.

10:38.271 --> 10:41.341
I want to help you,
but you have to help me.

10:56.857 --> 10:59.125
The motion is about
whether I can represent you.

10:59.159 --> 11:01.695
Technically,
since lawyers at my firm

11:01.728 --> 11:04.030
are material witnesses,
that would prevent me

11:04.064 --> 11:06.933
from being able to represent
you without a waiver.

11:11.071 --> 11:15.341
I'm going to have Dr. Murphy
examine you again, okay?

11:15.375 --> 11:18.011
He's the same doctor
I had look at you before.

11:21.147 --> 11:24.184
Scott, I need for you
to talk to me here.

11:24.217 --> 11:26.486
and I need for you
to talk to Dr. Murphy.

11:26.520 --> 11:29.255
What's the point now,
Bobby?

11:33.259 --> 11:35.495
Look, you may think
everything's over now,

11:35.529 --> 11:38.031
and you know what?
Maybe it is.

11:38.064 --> 11:42.035
But maybe it doesn't
have to be.

11:42.068 --> 11:44.771
Your whole life depends
on this next month.

11:44.805 --> 11:47.340
Don't lose 50 years
because you feel like sulking.

11:53.079 --> 11:56.482
Scott, I won't pretend to know
what you're going through,

11:56.517 --> 12:00.120
but I do know you need help

12:00.153 --> 12:03.857
and you need
to let me help you

12:03.890 --> 12:06.893
and the doctors.

12:06.927 --> 12:08.895
You've trusted me
up to now.

12:08.929 --> 12:12.966
You've got to keep
trusting me.

12:12.999 --> 12:15.869
Okay?

12:15.902 --> 12:18.739
Okay.

12:27.280 --> 12:29.916
And he wants
to talk to you.

12:29.950 --> 12:31.284
First of all,

12:31.317 --> 12:33.453
you shouldn't have
continued the conversation.

12:33.486 --> 12:34.788
I only did it
because it seemed to be

12:34.821 --> 12:36.523
a matter of life and death,

12:36.557 --> 12:38.324
and if what
he is saying is true,

12:38.358 --> 12:41.828
then he doesn't really
have counsel, does he?

12:44.430 --> 12:45.932
Where is he now?

12:45.966 --> 12:48.301
In a cell. I could have
him here in 30 seconds.

12:48.334 --> 12:51.271
There has to be a defense
attorney present.

12:51.304 --> 12:52.839
Why?

12:52.873 --> 12:54.941
Because there does.

13:05.586 --> 13:08.488
Mr. Young?

13:08.522 --> 13:10.156
Can you come?

13:14.394 --> 13:17.197
Mr. Young,
this is Kevin Macklin.

13:17.230 --> 13:20.934
I need you to just stand here
while I figure this out.

13:20.967 --> 13:22.569
Figure what out?

13:22.603 --> 13:25.405
Just hold the wall up
for a second, please.

13:26.640 --> 13:29.576
All right, Mr. Macklin,

13:29.610 --> 13:31.545
what is it you wanted
to see me about?

13:31.578 --> 13:35.849
Like I told Ms. Gamble,
I want to plead guilty.

13:35.882 --> 13:38.184
Whoa, your honor,
I'm out of here.

13:38.218 --> 13:40.320
Stay still, Mr. Young.

13:43.590 --> 13:46.560
If you want to plead guilty,
sir, that is your right,

13:46.593 --> 13:49.963
but you need to discuss that
with your lawyer.

13:49.996 --> 13:52.498
Mr. Reese doesn't really
represent me.

13:52.533 --> 13:55.135
When I got arrested,
the people I work for

13:55.168 --> 13:57.871
arranged for him
to defend me.

13:57.904 --> 14:00.574
His job is to make sure
I don't talk to the police,

14:00.607 --> 14:03.209
and if he found out we were
having this conversation

14:03.243 --> 14:05.078
right now, I'd be dead.

14:12.052 --> 14:15.956
Okay, Mr. Macklin,
let's see what happens.

14:15.989 --> 14:17.490
Mr. Young, as of now,

14:17.524 --> 14:21.595
I'm appointing you this
defendant's shadow counsel.

14:21.628 --> 14:23.229
Shadow what?

14:23.263 --> 14:26.232
I am removing Mr. Reese
with Mr. Macklin's consent

14:26.266 --> 14:29.936
and I am assigning you
in his place.

14:29.970 --> 14:31.237
Well, you can't do that.

14:31.271 --> 14:33.640
I can do it, and it's done.

14:33.674 --> 14:35.375
In the next eight hours,

14:35.408 --> 14:37.077
I expect you
to conference this case

14:37.110 --> 14:39.580
with your client,
with the district attorney,

14:39.613 --> 14:42.348
and with anybody else
who can make my life easier.

14:42.382 --> 14:43.984
What about Reese?

14:44.017 --> 14:45.652
Until I say so,

14:45.686 --> 14:48.254
nobody says anything
to Mr. Reese.

14:48.288 --> 14:49.656
Are we clear?

14:49.690 --> 14:51.257
Your honor, I --

14:51.291 --> 14:53.259
I'll adjourn the case
until tomorrow.

14:53.293 --> 14:55.128
If there is no resolution
by then,

14:55.161 --> 14:57.030
I intend to proceed
with the trial.

14:57.063 --> 14:59.032
I have to work
in this courthouse.

14:59.065 --> 15:01.535
My reputation with the state,
that's one thing,

15:01.568 --> 15:03.203
but these are my colleagues.

15:03.236 --> 15:05.271
I can't start
representing their clients

15:05.305 --> 15:06.940
behind their backs.

15:06.973 --> 15:08.308
Under the circumstances,

15:08.341 --> 15:10.276
I don't think we have
much of a choice.

15:10.310 --> 15:12.278
What are you going to
tell Reese?

15:12.312 --> 15:14.414
That the judge suddenly
isn't feeling well

15:14.447 --> 15:16.482
and the case is continued
until tomorrow.

15:16.517 --> 15:18.051
That's all he has to know.

15:18.084 --> 15:21.054
You're putting me into
a position where I can't --

15:21.087 --> 15:22.689
Talk to your client,
Eugene.

15:22.723 --> 15:26.527
I want an update
by the end of the day.

15:32.733 --> 15:34.300
She's sick?

15:34.334 --> 15:35.335
Evidently.

15:35.368 --> 15:36.703
We're continued
to tomorrow.

15:36.737 --> 15:38.705
She's probably in a hotel

15:38.739 --> 15:40.707
christening some new
public defender.

15:40.741 --> 15:42.308
I wouldn't doubt it.

15:42.342 --> 15:44.711
Remember the time
we zipped off to a motel

15:44.745 --> 15:46.713
during the recess
of the Abrams trial?

15:46.747 --> 15:48.114
Okay, don't remind me.

15:48.148 --> 15:49.315
You came back
without your underwear.

15:49.349 --> 15:51.451
Please.

15:51.484 --> 15:53.453
Look, I have
an insane idea.

15:53.486 --> 15:55.989
After the trial's over,

15:56.022 --> 15:58.058
loser takes the winner
to the north end --

15:58.091 --> 15:59.459
dinner at Emilio's.

15:59.492 --> 16:02.328
Mitchell, let's just try
to get through this thing

16:02.362 --> 16:04.598
before we start making
social plans, okay?

16:04.631 --> 16:07.734
Sure. I better go.
I want to see my client

16:07.768 --> 16:09.703
before he goes back
to county.

16:09.736 --> 16:12.072
Actually, I think
he's gone by now.

16:12.105 --> 16:14.174
You might have to
wait some on that.

16:18.244 --> 16:19.746
Here's a tip, Mr. Macklin --

16:19.780 --> 16:22.716
don't ever tell
the prosecutor you're guilty.

16:22.749 --> 16:24.618
What am I supposed to do?

16:24.651 --> 16:26.352
I'm not going to jail
for these people,

16:26.386 --> 16:28.021
not 15 years.

16:28.054 --> 16:30.356
Well, if you deal
with the state,

16:30.390 --> 16:32.392
you're looking
at witness protection.

16:32.425 --> 16:33.760
I know this.

16:33.794 --> 16:35.762
For you and your family.

16:35.796 --> 16:37.497
Basically, your life is over

16:37.531 --> 16:40.767
and you get the privilege
of starting a new one.

16:40.801 --> 16:43.136
So, what happens next?

16:43.169 --> 16:44.771
I make the deal,

16:44.805 --> 16:48.374
but first you tell the D. A.
who you work for,

16:48.408 --> 16:50.677
and she's going to want
details in writing.

16:50.711 --> 16:53.614
Now, assuming it makes,
you testify,

16:53.647 --> 16:55.181
then you go
into witness protection

16:55.215 --> 16:56.783
and join your family.

17:00.687 --> 17:03.089
Are you sure
you want to do this?

17:03.123 --> 17:06.358
As opposed to 15 years?

17:06.392 --> 17:09.530
Yeah, I'm sure.

17:13.867 --> 17:15.401
Could you add
a little more foam?

17:15.435 --> 17:16.703
Thanks.

17:23.309 --> 17:28.549
HINKS: Hi. Decaf no whip
non-fat mocha, please.

17:34.721 --> 17:37.824
Lindsay. Oops.

17:37.858 --> 17:40.627
Judge wouldn't like this.

17:40.661 --> 17:44.865
You have a restraining order
against you -- 1,000 feet.

17:44.898 --> 17:47.568
It never enjoined me
from getting coffee.

17:47.601 --> 17:50.270
How was I to know
you'd be here?

17:50.303 --> 17:53.206
Well, now you know,
so get out.

17:53.239 --> 17:56.242
Could you put a rush
on that mocha, please?

17:56.276 --> 17:58.712
I'm trying to elude capture.

17:58.745 --> 18:01.447
The puppy you sent --
what a cute idea.

18:01.481 --> 18:03.449
What puppy?

18:03.483 --> 18:05.218
What puppy?

18:16.396 --> 18:18.599
The client has
completely signed off.

18:18.632 --> 18:20.834
So he's insane when it comes
to shooting people,

18:20.867 --> 18:22.435
but for capacity
to waive conflicts,

18:22.468 --> 18:23.604
he's competent.

18:23.637 --> 18:24.871
His mental state
is another reason

18:24.905 --> 18:26.540
I need to be on this case,
your honor.

18:26.573 --> 18:29.510
Scott Wallace is not very
communicative at the moment.

18:29.543 --> 18:31.878
He needs somebody
he can trust.

18:31.912 --> 18:33.914
But can he fully trust you?

18:33.947 --> 18:35.516
Mr. Berluti, it seems,

18:35.549 --> 18:38.284
will be a vital
prosecutorial witness.

18:38.318 --> 18:40.253
I will represent
Mr. Wallace zealously

18:40.286 --> 18:42.756
with no regard
for Mr. Berluti's interests.

18:42.789 --> 18:45.391
I say that now
as an officer of the court.

18:45.425 --> 18:46.793
What about Ms. Frutt?

18:46.827 --> 18:48.494
I'm a little concerned
that she'll lean more

18:48.529 --> 18:49.796
towards being an advocate.

18:49.830 --> 18:52.432
The fact that Ms. Frutt
is a member of my firm

18:52.465 --> 18:53.834
gives Mr. Bay a free shot.

18:53.867 --> 18:55.569
He can impeach with bias.

18:55.602 --> 18:57.938
Yes, and that doesn't
help your client, does it?

18:57.971 --> 19:00.440
There certainly are
disadvantages here

19:00.473 --> 19:03.844
as well as dangers,
but the net result remains --

19:03.877 --> 19:07.614
Scott Wallace is best served
with me as his attorney.

19:07.648 --> 19:09.415
Mr. Bay?

19:09.449 --> 19:10.851
If the client
waives the conflicts,

19:10.884 --> 19:12.185
I won't oppose.

19:12.218 --> 19:16.389
Mr. Wallace, are you
waiving the conflicts?

19:18.892 --> 19:20.861
Uh, yes, your honor.

19:20.894 --> 19:24.464
I strongly advise
against it, sir,

19:24.497 --> 19:26.199
but I won't stop you.

19:26.232 --> 19:27.601
Thank you, your honor.

19:27.634 --> 19:29.603
Witness lists
by the end of the week.

19:29.636 --> 19:31.638
We'll see you for trial
in two weeks.

19:32.539 --> 19:34.741
Bobby.

19:34.775 --> 19:36.877
Not that you'd ever
take my advice,

19:36.910 --> 19:39.479
but I'd at least get a second
chair from another firm.

19:39.513 --> 19:43.249
You're right, I'd never
take your advice.

19:43.283 --> 19:45.752
People insult me
even when I'm nice.

19:47.988 --> 19:50.924
We stipulate to withdrawing
the guilty plea,

19:50.957 --> 19:52.826
enter guilty
to narcotic trafficking,

19:52.859 --> 19:54.928
Mr. Macklin goes
into witness protection,

19:54.961 --> 19:58.532
all of this is conditioned
on a detailed statement.

19:58.565 --> 20:00.867
And you're confident this man
has the information

20:00.901 --> 20:02.936
to warrant such a break?

20:02.969 --> 20:04.538
He's the chemist.

20:04.571 --> 20:07.473
He's got names, locations.
He's a gold mine.

20:07.508 --> 20:09.576
What if he turns out
not to be a gold mine?

20:09.610 --> 20:12.012
Then I have the right
to call the deal off.

20:12.045 --> 20:14.948
Eugene?

20:14.981 --> 20:16.550
A little quiet.

20:16.583 --> 20:18.919
I think
the whole thing stinks.

20:18.952 --> 20:20.821
Not to betray my new client,

20:20.854 --> 20:23.489
but he could be making
everything up,

20:23.524 --> 20:25.358
and on his word alone,

20:25.391 --> 20:26.927
we've gone behind the back
of defense counsel.

20:26.960 --> 20:29.596
It smells lousy to me.

20:29.630 --> 20:30.997
Do I look like
I'm having fun?

20:31.031 --> 20:34.668
All right,
let's bring him in.

20:40.607 --> 20:41.975
Mitchell.

20:44.978 --> 20:48.682
Eugene, hey.

20:48.715 --> 20:51.552
What's going on?

20:51.585 --> 20:53.954
There's no easy way
to say this, counsel,

20:53.987 --> 20:56.590
so I'll get right
to the point.

20:56.623 --> 20:58.424
The trial is over.

20:58.458 --> 21:00.994
What do you mean?
You're granting a mistrial?

21:01.027 --> 21:02.563
There's no mistrial.

21:02.596 --> 21:06.299
Your client, Mr. Macklin,
has pled guilty.

21:06.332 --> 21:08.902
Guilty? That's ridiculous.

21:08.935 --> 21:10.336
How could he plead guilty
without a lawyer?

21:10.370 --> 21:11.838
He had a lawyer.

21:11.872 --> 21:13.607
At Mr. Macklin's request,

21:13.640 --> 21:16.442
I assigned Eugene Young
to replace you.

21:16.476 --> 21:19.713
Excuse me?
Where's my client?

21:19.746 --> 21:20.981
What is this,
some sort of a joke?

21:21.014 --> 21:23.316
Get my client in here now.

21:23.349 --> 21:24.585
At his request,

21:24.618 --> 21:25.886
Mr. Macklin entered
witness protection

21:25.919 --> 21:27.053
an hour ago.

21:27.087 --> 21:30.023
Witness protection? Helen?

21:30.056 --> 21:31.758
He claims you were hired
to defend him

21:31.792 --> 21:32.959
by the drug ring

21:32.993 --> 21:34.595
and that you actually
work for them.

21:34.628 --> 21:35.962
And you believed him?

21:35.996 --> 21:38.599
He also feared
for his life.

21:38.632 --> 21:41.602
So, what,
you just replaced me?

21:41.635 --> 21:43.003
Your honor, this afternoon

21:43.036 --> 21:44.538
when you asked
for a continuance,

21:44.571 --> 21:45.872
that was a lie?

21:45.906 --> 21:48.809
At the time, I felt
it was best to mislead you.

21:48.842 --> 21:50.010
What?

21:50.043 --> 21:53.013
Helen, you've known me
for 12 years.

21:53.046 --> 21:54.615
I've prosecuted these cases.

21:54.648 --> 21:57.350
Didn't you think I deserved
to know about this,

21:57.383 --> 21:58.885
at least have a chance
to defend myself?

21:58.919 --> 22:00.486
How could we tell you?

22:00.521 --> 22:02.889
If the client was right,
it might get him killed.

22:02.923 --> 22:06.660
Well, you made a mistake,
both of you.

22:06.693 --> 22:08.695
I'm going straight
to the bar.

22:10.964 --> 22:14.467
Who hired you
to represent Kevin Macklin?

22:14.500 --> 22:15.936
Go to hell.

22:15.969 --> 22:17.504
I'll ask you again.

22:17.538 --> 22:19.573
Who hired you
to represent Kevin Macklin?

22:19.606 --> 22:21.107
I'm not saying anything.

22:21.141 --> 22:23.677
You don't have a choice.

22:23.710 --> 22:25.512
Mitchell,
this is a subpoena

22:25.546 --> 22:27.013
commanding your
immediate appearance

22:27.047 --> 22:29.415
before a grand jury.

22:29.449 --> 22:33.386
Mitchell, it's up to you.

22:33.419 --> 22:35.522
You tell us now
or you tell us then.

22:35.556 --> 22:37.057
Attorney-client privilege.

22:37.090 --> 22:40.026
Your honor, the person who
hired me is also a client.

22:40.060 --> 22:42.128
Who I represent
is highly confidential.

22:42.162 --> 22:45.766
The identity of your client
is outside the privilege.

22:45.799 --> 22:47.701
Not when you have
elements of the crime

22:47.734 --> 22:49.670
and revealing the identity
could incriminate.

22:49.703 --> 22:53.507
I am ordering you
to answer, counsel.

22:53.540 --> 22:55.108
Well, I won't.

22:59.012 --> 23:00.683
(door slams)

23:00.683 --> 23:01.705
(door slams)

23:14.094 --> 23:16.196
-He made again.
-One or two?

23:16.229 --> 23:17.564
You should get him
house trained

23:17.598 --> 23:18.832
before you bring him
in here, Lucy.

23:18.865 --> 23:20.567
He's training here.

23:22.503 --> 23:23.570
So he is a gold mine?

23:23.604 --> 23:24.971
They're making
arrests now,

23:25.005 --> 23:26.607
but he couldn't give them
the top names.

23:26.640 --> 23:27.608
Only Reese has them.

23:27.641 --> 23:28.909
And he won't tell?

23:28.942 --> 23:30.877
He's going before
the grand jury today.

23:30.911 --> 23:32.445
Well, does it matter
who went in first?

23:32.478 --> 23:33.880
1,000 feet's 1,000 feet.

23:33.914 --> 23:36.550
Okay, thanks.

23:36.583 --> 23:37.684
(sighs)

23:37.718 --> 23:38.919
What'd he say?

23:38.952 --> 23:40.687
They can't arrest him.

23:40.721 --> 23:42.122
They're going
to pay him a visit

23:42.155 --> 23:44.625
and try
to scare him again.

23:44.658 --> 23:46.159
Yeah, that seems
to be effective.

23:47.628 --> 23:49.663
Jimmy...

23:49.696 --> 23:50.964
can I talk to you?

23:56.703 --> 23:58.972
I'm sorry I jumped
all over you.

23:59.005 --> 24:03.243
The emotion of this case --

24:03.276 --> 24:04.878
I apologize.

24:04.911 --> 24:07.213
Okay.

24:07.247 --> 24:10.784
Scott Wallace is a very
good friend of mine,
I think.

24:10.817 --> 24:12.853
I understand.

24:12.886 --> 24:14.220
Look, as his friend,

24:14.254 --> 24:16.122
I think I'm
in a pretty good position

24:16.156 --> 24:17.858
to know whether
he's cracking up or --

24:17.891 --> 24:19.960
I know everything
that led up to this,

24:19.993 --> 24:21.528
and I also know you.

24:21.562 --> 24:22.863
Being in that room

24:22.896 --> 24:24.230
as the shots
were being fired...

24:24.264 --> 24:25.899
What are you saying?

24:25.932 --> 24:28.234
I think it's possible
that you perceived things

24:28.268 --> 24:30.704
other than
perhaps they were.

24:30.737 --> 24:32.539
You were clearly
shaken up.

24:32.573 --> 24:35.609
Bobby, first you try to
tell me what the truth is,

24:35.642 --> 24:37.143
now you're trying
to influence me --

24:37.177 --> 24:38.612
I'm just saying --

24:38.645 --> 24:40.246
No, this is
witness tampering.

24:40.280 --> 24:43.083
It's illegal.
I'm going to leave now

24:43.116 --> 24:45.151
before you do or say anything

24:45.185 --> 24:47.554
that makes me have to
go to the bar.

24:49.189 --> 24:50.557
And if you need
a good reason

24:50.591 --> 24:52.158
why you shouldn't
be doing this case,

24:52.192 --> 24:55.161
consider what you just did.

25:01.735 --> 25:03.737
He's upset
about the dog.

25:03.770 --> 25:05.105
He said that?

25:05.138 --> 25:07.741
I don't think
he gave you the dog,

25:07.774 --> 25:09.576
and he's angry that
somebody else did.

25:09.610 --> 25:10.577
Who?

25:10.611 --> 25:11.745
I don't know.

25:11.778 --> 25:13.113
Maybe the real killer.

25:13.146 --> 25:14.581
Oh, here we go again.

25:14.615 --> 25:17.117
William Hinks
is the real killer.

25:17.150 --> 25:18.752
He's stalking me, Jeannie.

25:18.785 --> 25:20.286
The stalking
also fits the pattern

25:20.320 --> 25:21.755
of his delusions,

25:21.788 --> 25:23.289
his wanting
to be thought of as --

25:23.323 --> 25:24.991
I'm not going
to get into this.

25:25.025 --> 25:26.927
Look, since you are
treating him,

25:26.960 --> 25:28.862
I would just like you
to prevail upon him

25:28.895 --> 25:31.264
not to stalk me anymore.
Can you do that?

25:31.297 --> 25:33.299
I can't promise
I'll be effective,

25:33.333 --> 25:34.768
but I'll certainly try.

25:34.801 --> 25:36.603
Thank you,
and thank you so much

25:36.637 --> 25:38.939
for bringing me
into this to begin with.

25:38.972 --> 25:40.874
His being upset
over the dog

25:40.907 --> 25:42.576
doesn't make sense to me,

25:42.609 --> 25:45.612
not if he's the one
who gave it to you.

25:48.815 --> 25:51.151
No, it's like talking
to a brick wall, you know?

25:51.184 --> 25:53.319
I think she's the one
suffering from delusions.

25:53.353 --> 25:55.155
Michael McGuire
just called.

25:55.188 --> 25:57.323
They're on their way
to see him.

25:57.357 --> 26:00.326
Good. Now,
can we talk about you

26:00.360 --> 26:02.362
and the Wallace case?

26:02.395 --> 26:05.165
365 Federal.

26:05.198 --> 26:09.803
You know, Jeannie thinks
because you feel responsible

26:09.836 --> 26:11.805
for putting Scott
back out on the street,

26:11.838 --> 26:13.807
you could be obsessed
with defending him here

26:13.840 --> 26:16.076
because you feel the need
to defend yourself.

26:16.109 --> 26:17.811
That is a pile of --

26:17.844 --> 26:19.045
It makes sense.

26:19.079 --> 26:20.914
It's ridiculous.

26:20.947 --> 26:23.049
I'm not even
going to discuss it.

26:23.083 --> 26:24.250
Uh, Bobby?

26:24.284 --> 26:25.251
(dial tone)

26:25.285 --> 26:27.220
(sighs)
Fine.

26:39.099 --> 26:40.100
Aah!

26:48.041 --> 26:50.110
Are you sure?

26:50.143 --> 26:51.678
Yes, I'm sure.

26:51.712 --> 26:53.680
I saw him right
in the rearview mirror.

26:53.714 --> 26:55.682
He picked me up,
I was in the cab,

26:55.716 --> 26:58.084
I looked in the mirror,
and it was him.

26:58.118 --> 27:00.987
What are you waiting for,
Mike? Get this guy.

27:06.893 --> 27:09.696
You want me to do it?
I'd be happy to.

27:09.730 --> 27:11.097
I'm in it this far.

27:11.131 --> 27:13.099
Helen, you used to
go out with this guy.

27:13.133 --> 27:15.969
You really want to be hauling
him before the grand jury?

27:16.002 --> 27:18.238
No, but you don't know
the case. I should --

27:18.271 --> 27:20.907
So, you can bring me
up to speed.

27:23.009 --> 27:24.277
I'll do it.

27:27.714 --> 27:29.082
There was a time

27:29.115 --> 27:31.284
when you represented a client
named Kevin Macklin.

27:31.317 --> 27:32.385
Until yesterday.

27:32.418 --> 27:33.987
You subverted
the judicial process

27:34.020 --> 27:35.956
and conspired to replace me.

27:35.989 --> 27:37.991
I only have
one question, sir.

27:38.024 --> 27:40.894
Who hired you
to represent Kevin Macklin?

27:40.927 --> 27:43.229
I refuse to answer
on the grounds

27:43.263 --> 27:44.798
of attorney-client privilege

27:44.831 --> 27:46.166
and under the protection
afforded me

27:46.199 --> 27:47.734
by the United States
Constitution

27:47.768 --> 27:49.069
and Article 12

27:49.102 --> 27:51.004
of the Massachusetts
Declaration of Rights.

27:51.037 --> 27:52.438
That's another way of saying

27:52.472 --> 27:54.240
you don't want
to incriminate yourself.

27:54.274 --> 27:57.143
I refuse to answer
on the grounds already stated.

27:57.177 --> 27:59.012
I'm sorry, Mr. Reese.
It's not that easy.

27:59.045 --> 28:01.014
You're not a target
of this investigation.

28:01.047 --> 28:03.049
You've been given full
transactional immunity

28:03.083 --> 28:05.285
for any crime
that is revealed

28:05.318 --> 28:06.920
by your testimony.

28:06.953 --> 28:09.756
I can't prosecute you
for anything you say.

28:09.790 --> 28:11.825
That means you have to
answer the question.

28:11.858 --> 28:15.028
My answer would violate
the attorney-client privilege.

28:15.061 --> 28:18.031
A judge has rejected
that argument.

28:18.064 --> 28:21.034
Who hired you
to represent Kevin Macklin?

28:21.067 --> 28:24.037
Who approached you?
Who paid you?

28:28.041 --> 28:30.476
Think about what
you're doing, Mitchell --

28:30.511 --> 28:32.378
Your reputation,

28:32.412 --> 28:35.315
your license to practice.

28:35.348 --> 28:38.952
You are risking
incarceration for contempt.

28:38.985 --> 28:41.054
Contempt?
You're a hypocrite, Helen.

28:41.087 --> 28:42.455
Everything you've done here

28:42.488 --> 28:45.058
has shown contempt
for this system.

28:45.091 --> 28:46.226
Please answer the question.

28:46.259 --> 28:47.761
I'm gone.

28:47.794 --> 28:49.963
Bailiff,
please stop Mr. Reese.

28:49.996 --> 28:52.198
You've got to be kidding.

28:52.232 --> 28:54.067
Mitchell Reese,
you're being held

28:54.100 --> 28:56.503
for contempt
of the grand jury.

29:01.842 --> 29:06.012
You don't know
what you're doing, Helen.

29:07.548 --> 29:09.850
You have no idea
what you're doing.

29:19.259 --> 29:22.428
-Motion in what?
-Limine.

29:22.462 --> 29:24.831
The prosecution is trying
to suppress everything

29:24.865 --> 29:26.266
about your wife's death.

29:26.299 --> 29:28.268
Well, that's good
for us, isn't it?

29:28.301 --> 29:30.103
No, Scott,
that's not good for us.

29:30.136 --> 29:32.105
We need to prove
you were insane

29:32.138 --> 29:34.541
when you killed Harry Duvall,
what you went through.

29:34.575 --> 29:36.543
It helps explain
your state of mind.

29:36.577 --> 29:39.546
No, no. If the jury thinks
that I killed Karen --

29:39.580 --> 29:41.014
They won't.

29:41.047 --> 29:42.448
You were acquitted.

29:42.482 --> 29:44.551
It doesn't matter, Bobby.
Don't you get it?

29:44.585 --> 29:47.120
I lost my job,
all of my friends.

29:47.153 --> 29:49.489
Nobody cares
that I was acquitted.

29:49.523 --> 29:50.857
They still think
I'm guilty.

29:50.891 --> 29:52.559
I need to prove
your mental condition.

29:52.593 --> 29:55.128
No, no, you're making me
look like a murderer.

29:55.161 --> 29:57.130
Scott, this is
our only chance.

29:57.163 --> 29:59.866
We can't win this
any other way.

30:02.135 --> 30:05.038
Look at me.

30:06.439 --> 30:09.142
Dr. Murphy is prepared
to support our theory

30:09.175 --> 30:10.577
of temporary insanity,

30:10.611 --> 30:14.147
but you did bring a gun
to the meeting. Why?

30:16.617 --> 30:19.152
Did you go there
to kill him, Scott?

30:19.185 --> 30:24.591
No, no, I...

30:24.625 --> 30:28.328
I planned to kill myself
in front of him.

30:28.361 --> 30:31.297
No.

30:31.331 --> 30:37.170
I figured my own blood
on his hands...

30:37.203 --> 30:41.608
and then suddenly...

30:41.642 --> 30:46.179
better his blood on mine.

30:50.216 --> 30:54.187
And when you turned
to Ellenor and Jimmy

30:54.220 --> 30:56.189
and you said,

30:56.222 --> 31:00.627
"Bet you're glad
I ran out of bullets"...

31:00.661 --> 31:04.364
Would you have
shot them, too, Scott?

31:06.232 --> 31:08.234
Maybe.

31:31.958 --> 31:36.296
You used to be
a prosecutor, Mitchell.

31:36.329 --> 31:39.199
I just can't believe it.

31:39.232 --> 31:41.668
Then why am I
sitting here?

31:41.702 --> 31:44.270
Because his story's
checking out.

31:44.304 --> 31:48.308
Look, completely
off the record --

31:48.341 --> 31:49.610
Oh, yes,
let me trust you.

31:49.643 --> 31:51.344
You can.

31:51.377 --> 31:53.079
I think you know
you still can.

31:53.113 --> 31:54.480
The man's life was in danger.

31:54.515 --> 31:56.382
I had to do what I did.

31:58.084 --> 32:00.086
Look, completely
off the record --

32:00.120 --> 32:03.056
not that they're
after you anyway --

32:03.089 --> 32:07.060
but off the record...

32:07.093 --> 32:08.595
why?

32:08.629 --> 32:10.396
Go away, Helen.

32:10.430 --> 32:12.566
Mitchell, talk to me.

32:12.599 --> 32:14.100
You have no right
to judge me.

32:14.134 --> 32:16.136
That's not why I'm here.

32:16.169 --> 32:20.240
I am trying to understand
why would you do this.

32:26.046 --> 32:30.016
At first it was just supposed
to be some arraignments --

32:30.050 --> 32:34.020
make your appearance,
argue for bail.

32:34.054 --> 32:38.024
Over time...

32:38.058 --> 32:42.195
it's a lot of money.

32:42.228 --> 32:45.331
I started taking trials --

32:45.365 --> 32:48.702
cash up front...

32:48.735 --> 32:51.437
win or lose.

32:51.471 --> 32:54.007
And you started
throwing cases.

32:54.040 --> 32:57.343
Never. Never.

32:57.377 --> 33:00.714
I always do the best I can
for my client.

33:00.747 --> 33:04.350
Sometimes I even win.

33:04.384 --> 33:07.721
There's only one rule --
nobody talks.

33:07.754 --> 33:10.724
No matter
what the state offers,

33:10.757 --> 33:13.359
nobody talks.

33:13.393 --> 33:14.728
But, Mitchell,

33:14.761 --> 33:17.598
sometimes that amounts
to tanking cases.

33:20.567 --> 33:23.469
Just give us names.

33:25.772 --> 33:29.743
I'm not going to reveal
who my client is, Helen.

33:29.776 --> 33:31.578
Too ethical?

33:31.612 --> 33:34.380
You can go.

33:34.414 --> 33:37.584
I'm not talking.

33:37.618 --> 33:41.121
I was just trying
to save the guy.

33:42.488 --> 33:45.759
You really think
you saved him?

33:45.792 --> 33:47.761
Witness protection?
It doesn't matter.

33:47.794 --> 33:50.764
These people will find him.

33:50.797 --> 33:54.167
You haven't saved anybody.

33:58.438 --> 34:00.440
Guard.

34:27.400 --> 34:29.402
LUCY: Chopper?

34:31.371 --> 34:34.139
Chopper, where are you?

34:36.242 --> 34:38.378
Chopper.

34:38.411 --> 34:39.746
Come here, boy.

34:39.780 --> 34:41.414
(whistles)

34:43.149 --> 34:44.685
Chopper.

34:47.621 --> 34:49.422
Aah!

34:51.792 --> 34:53.359
I'd like to dust
the whole place.

34:53.393 --> 34:54.628
Why aren't you
picking him up?

34:54.661 --> 34:55.862
Lindsay, we don't
even know for sure --

34:55.896 --> 34:57.397
We know, Michael.
We know who did this.

34:57.430 --> 34:59.199
All right, Lindsay,
hold on.

34:59.232 --> 35:00.901
You hold on. You don't
have a psycho after you.

35:00.934 --> 35:03.537
Why can't you bring him in
for questioning?

35:03.570 --> 35:05.906
We can do that.

35:05.939 --> 35:07.741
Then let's.

35:07.774 --> 35:09.576
Are you okay?

35:12.312 --> 35:14.615
No.

35:27.327 --> 35:29.663
I just came from court.

35:29.696 --> 35:33.667
I told the judge
I had no good-faith basis

35:33.700 --> 35:37.671
to believe holding you
in contempt would result

35:37.704 --> 35:40.574
in your revealing the names.

35:40.607 --> 35:42.876
You're free to go.

35:55.978 --> 36:01.327
Helen, I won't begin
to defend working

36:01.361 --> 36:04.698
for the people I...

36:04.731 --> 36:08.334
or doing...

36:08.368 --> 36:11.337
but this
shadow counsel thing,

36:11.371 --> 36:14.708
going behind
a defense attorney's back,

36:14.741 --> 36:17.343
it's equally unethical,

36:17.377 --> 36:19.713
maybe more so.

36:19.746 --> 36:21.715
No, it isn't, Mitchell.

36:21.748 --> 36:24.751
I'm sorry
you can't see that.

36:37.631 --> 36:39.600
It's prior bad acts.
It's inadmissible.

36:39.633 --> 36:41.267
That's a defense argument.

36:41.301 --> 36:43.937
It's also totally irrelevant
who else he may have killed.

36:43.970 --> 36:45.371
It goes directly
to our insanity defense.

36:45.405 --> 36:46.773
It is not irrelevant.

36:46.807 --> 36:48.374
It's always
a different angle.

36:48.408 --> 36:50.243
I'd like to be able
to finish my argument.

36:50.276 --> 36:51.311
Bobby, how can you
even stand here today

36:51.344 --> 36:52.846
in good conscience?

36:52.879 --> 36:54.948
Why don't you turn around
and face the Duvall family?

36:54.981 --> 36:57.417
Because of your brilliant
legal maneuvering,

36:57.450 --> 36:59.520
Scott Wallace got
to go back on the street.

36:59.553 --> 37:00.887
Because you were able
to spin reasonable doubt,

37:00.921 --> 37:02.388
an innocent man
was shot down!

37:02.422 --> 37:03.524
I object to that!

37:03.557 --> 37:04.525
Mr. Bay!

37:04.558 --> 37:06.793
It has to be said.

37:06.827 --> 37:09.029
You killed him, not me!

37:09.062 --> 37:11.297
You arrested the wrong man.

37:11.331 --> 37:12.298
Counsel!

37:12.332 --> 37:14.267
I want to respond to that.

37:14.300 --> 37:17.504
You drove him crazy!

37:17.538 --> 37:19.506
He lost his wife,
you accused him.

37:19.540 --> 37:21.808
You took away his life,
his sanity.

37:21.842 --> 37:24.277
Mr. Duvall is dead

37:24.310 --> 37:26.747
because of the Commonwealth
of Massachusetts!

37:28.448 --> 37:31.885
The Commonwealth
of Massachusetts!

37:31.918 --> 37:33.954
Don't be blaming me.

37:33.987 --> 37:35.622
You killed him.

37:35.656 --> 37:36.823
REBECCA: Bobby.

37:42.395 --> 37:44.598
They killed him.

37:46.466 --> 37:48.702
They did it.

37:55.408 --> 37:57.511
I'm allowing evidence
of the first crime

37:57.544 --> 37:59.713
to be introduced,

37:59.746 --> 38:03.016
however, Mr. Donnell,
I advised you once

38:03.049 --> 38:05.986
to get off this case because
of the inherent conflicts.

38:06.019 --> 38:10.056
I reissue that advisement
for emotional reasons as well.

38:10.090 --> 38:13.459
You can do
what you want to do,

38:13.493 --> 38:16.730
but I hope you know
what you're doing.

38:16.763 --> 38:17.998
We're adjourned.

38:18.031 --> 38:19.499
(bangs gavel)

38:26.507 --> 38:29.843
Come on, Bobby.

38:29.876 --> 38:31.512
Let's go.

38:37.784 --> 38:39.853
Look, I'm happy to say

38:39.886 --> 38:41.588
I've committed
multiple homicides,

38:41.622 --> 38:43.857
but I wouldn't be
caught dead

38:43.890 --> 38:45.592
driving a cab.

38:45.626 --> 38:49.029
It's only under duress
I would even hail one.

38:49.062 --> 38:50.764
They all smell

38:50.797 --> 38:52.699
of those hideous little
evergreen tree fresheners.

38:52.733 --> 38:55.736
Where were you
yesterday afternoon?

38:57.904 --> 39:01.875
Belmont, grove street park,
walking my dog,

39:01.908 --> 39:05.411
looking to meet a new friend.

39:05.445 --> 39:07.480
Were you with anybody?

39:07.514 --> 39:11.484
I go alone...

39:11.518 --> 39:14.888
in case I do meet
that friend.

39:24.565 --> 39:26.633
He's lying.

39:26.667 --> 39:27.901
He may be, but --

39:27.934 --> 39:29.503
I saw him, Michael.
It was him.

39:29.536 --> 39:31.772
I don't care if it was
a rearview mirror.

39:31.805 --> 39:33.439
It was him. I know it.

39:33.473 --> 39:36.042
I don't know where
he would get a taxicab.

39:36.076 --> 39:37.878
It was him.

39:37.911 --> 39:39.780
I'll check
with the cab companies,

39:39.813 --> 39:41.615
see if any
were reported missing.

39:41.648 --> 39:42.949
I'll let you know.

39:47.554 --> 39:49.455
So basically
he doesn't believe you.

39:49.489 --> 39:50.891
He questions my I. D.,
yeah.

39:50.924 --> 39:53.059
BOBBY: Well,
we're getting a guard --

39:53.093 --> 39:54.895
one for here,
another for our apartment.

39:54.928 --> 39:56.563
Lucy, could you
take care of that?

39:56.597 --> 39:57.931
Done.

39:57.964 --> 40:02.736
So, what's the meeting about?

40:02.769 --> 40:05.171
Well, the firm has
some concerns.

40:05.205 --> 40:07.574
We all think
it would be best

40:07.608 --> 40:10.010
not to represent
Scott Wallace.

40:10.043 --> 40:12.478
Forget it.

40:12.513 --> 40:14.480
Bobby, two people here
are witnesses.

40:14.515 --> 40:16.817
I covered that.
The client waived the conflicts.

40:16.850 --> 40:19.019
-It isn't just that.
-Then what is it, Eugene?

40:19.052 --> 40:20.821
Why don't you tell me?

40:20.854 --> 40:23.990
I'll tell you. You were losing
it in court today, Bobby.

40:24.024 --> 40:26.092
You're too close to this.
You're too emotional.

40:26.126 --> 40:28.094
I was emotional because my wife
is being threatened

40:28.128 --> 40:29.596
by some psycho.

40:29.630 --> 40:31.898
-Well, whatever the reason --
-I'm doing it.

40:34.535 --> 40:36.202
It isn't your decision.

40:36.236 --> 40:39.205
It should be subject
to a partnership vote.

40:39.239 --> 40:41.708
I'm sorry, Bobby,
but I agree with them.

40:41.742 --> 40:45.512
EUGENE: Scott will be
served better.

40:45.546 --> 40:47.514
Scott Wallace is
in a psychological crisis

40:47.548 --> 40:49.816
right now, Eugene.
You know that.

40:51.885 --> 40:54.955
He needs an attorney
he has a trust with.

40:54.988 --> 40:59.192
I...I can better represent him
than any other lawyer.

41:01.294 --> 41:02.796
We should vote, Bobby.

41:02.829 --> 41:06.700
Fine.

41:06.733 --> 41:09.736
All those in favor
of me representing him.

41:17.844 --> 41:19.580
All opposed.

41:24.651 --> 41:26.219
The ayes have it.

41:41.768 --> 41:44.538
Nice ambush, Lindsay.

41:46.607 --> 41:48.609
Can't you see how emotional
you're getting?

41:48.642 --> 41:50.977
I was worried about you,
for God's sake.

41:53.146 --> 41:56.082
Do you feel responsible
for the shooting?

41:58.819 --> 42:01.221
Bobby.

42:01.254 --> 42:04.124
Look, you believed
his wife committed suicide.

42:04.157 --> 42:07.761
I still do.

42:07.794 --> 42:09.663
In which case you couldn't
possibly foresee

42:09.696 --> 42:12.065
that he would walk
into a meeting with a gun.

42:14.334 --> 42:16.102
I know.

42:19.840 --> 42:22.709
You can't put this thing
on yourself, Bobby.

42:22.743 --> 42:24.778
I'm not doing that,
Lindsay.

42:24.811 --> 42:27.347
It's just...

42:27.380 --> 42:31.051
I'm the only one
who can help him here.

42:31.084 --> 42:34.187
I can't pull out
on him now.

42:36.657 --> 42:39.860
You have to let me do it.

42:57.377 --> 43:00.080
Helen?

43:00.113 --> 43:01.748
What happened?

43:01.782 --> 43:03.817
Down here.

43:03.850 --> 43:06.019
It looks like a hit.

43:06.052 --> 43:08.655
What happened
to witness protection?

43:08.689 --> 43:09.990
What?

43:10.023 --> 43:12.358
He was supposed to be
in witness protection.

43:12.392 --> 43:14.761
Nobody told me anything
about that.

43:14.795 --> 43:16.863
Watch your step.

43:24.905 --> 43:28.308
They say he used
to be a D. A.

43:28.341 --> 43:30.010
Oh, my...

43:35.281 --> 43:37.217
Helen, you okay?

44:11.284 --> 44:13.286
â™ª (theme)

44:37.110 --> 44:38.444
You stinker!
