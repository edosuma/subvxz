WEBVTT

00:01.293 --> 00:02.418
Previously on "The 100"...

00:02.628 --> 00:04.462
I have a message
for your leader.

00:04.672 --> 00:05.922
We're coming for him.

00:06.131 --> 00:08.383
250 people died
in that village.

00:08.592 --> 00:10.802
I know you felt
for them,

00:11.011 --> 00:12.595
but you let them burn.

00:12.805 --> 00:13.763
Not everyone.

00:16.850 --> 00:18.685
Some of them aren't
wearing Hazmat suits.

00:18.894 --> 00:20.019
Means they're cured.

00:20.229 --> 00:21.521
The marrow
treatments worked.

00:21.730 --> 00:22.939
We're going to hide you.

00:23.148 --> 00:24.273
Not everyone here
agrees with Cage.

00:24.483 --> 00:25.733
Come with me.
You're safe now.

00:25.943 --> 00:27.402
44 people
don't just vanish

00:27.611 --> 00:28.861
inside of
a sealed bunker.

00:29.071 --> 00:30.530
They could if they had
enough help.

00:30.739 --> 00:32.573
Stay alive.
Be ready to fight.

00:32.783 --> 00:34.200
War is coming.

00:58.267 --> 01:00.101
Get up.
It's time to go.

01:00.310 --> 01:01.894
I told you I'd
come back for you.

01:02.104 --> 01:03.187
Come on out.

01:03.397 --> 01:04.439
Our people are marching
on Mount Weather

01:04.648 --> 01:05.940
right now.

01:10.154 --> 01:12.530
Hey. It's OK.
We're getting you out.

01:12.740 --> 01:14.699
Slow down.

01:14.908 --> 01:16.284
They just bled him.

01:16.493 --> 01:19.120
Listen to me.
There's an army inside this room,

01:19.329 --> 01:21.205
and I need you to help me
get them ready to fight.

01:21.415 --> 01:22.749
Can you do that?

01:25.210 --> 01:26.794
All right.
Start with him.

01:32.968 --> 01:33.926
Too much noise.

01:45.022 --> 01:48.399
OK.
How do we do this?

01:48.609 --> 01:51.110
There's an army
outside going for the main door.

01:51.320 --> 01:53.488
When they get it open,
all hell will break loose.

01:53.697 --> 01:56.824
That is the signal for my friends
to come here, and--

01:58.243 --> 01:59.243
My fellow citizens,

01:59.453 --> 02:00.828
this is your
president speaking.

02:01.038 --> 02:02.914
I have news to share
with you

02:03.123 --> 02:06.042
that will change
all of our lives forever.

02:06.251 --> 02:07.794
For 97 years,

02:08.003 --> 02:10.546
Mount Weather
has been our home.

02:10.756 --> 02:12.423
It's kept us alive,

02:12.633 --> 02:15.593
but it has also
held us captive.

02:15.803 --> 02:18.221
Most of us have made peace
with what we've had to do

02:18.430 --> 02:19.722
to survive.

02:19.932 --> 02:22.266
We've done these things
for one reason--

02:22.476 --> 02:24.310
so that our people

02:24.520 --> 02:27.146
could someday return
to the ground.

02:28.941 --> 02:30.817
That day is today.

02:33.737 --> 02:35.321
He's going public.

02:35.531 --> 02:38.866
Before my friend
Lorelai Tsing was murdered

02:39.076 --> 02:41.410
by the outsiders still
at large in this Mountain,

02:41.620 --> 02:43.162
she found a cure.

02:43.372 --> 02:45.289
It was in their bone marrow.

02:45.499 --> 02:47.166
Here. I'll be back.

02:47.376 --> 02:48.793
Where are you going?

02:49.002 --> 02:50.837
He's trying to get his people
to turn on each other.

02:51.046 --> 02:52.088
They'll find my friends.

02:52.297 --> 02:53.422
I have to bring them
here now.

02:53.632 --> 02:54.841
I'll send them
in groups.

02:55.050 --> 02:56.509
You get your people
ready to go,

02:56.718 --> 02:59.262
but you wait for me
to come back, do you understand?

02:59.471 --> 03:00.555
Wait!

03:02.432 --> 03:03.850
Thank you.

03:04.059 --> 03:05.101
You free your people.

03:05.310 --> 03:07.311
Protect mine
when they get here.

03:07.521 --> 03:09.939
We can thank each other
when we're all outside.

03:10.149 --> 03:11.399
This has been

03:11.608 --> 03:14.735
the dream of our people
since the bombs,

03:14.945 --> 03:16.654
but to reach it now,

03:16.864 --> 03:19.073
I need your help.

03:19.283 --> 03:22.702
The 44 criminals
that irradiated level 5,

03:22.911 --> 03:25.955
killing 15
of our people,

03:26.165 --> 03:30.126
are now keeping us
from that dream.

03:30.335 --> 03:32.962
Although we've
repaired our home,

03:33.172 --> 03:36.549
we can never replace
the lives that were

03:36.758 --> 03:39.760
so viciously taken from us,

03:39.970 --> 03:41.596
and as hard as it is
to believe,

03:41.805 --> 03:43.639
there are those among us

03:43.849 --> 03:46.475
who would help
the people who did this,

03:46.685 --> 03:49.437
and I am speaking
to you now.

03:49.646 --> 03:52.440
If you truly want to end
the blood treatments

03:52.649 --> 03:54.233
once and for all,

03:54.443 --> 03:57.361
then the 44 murderers
you're now hiding

03:57.571 --> 04:00.156
are the key to doing that.

04:00.365 --> 04:03.075
You have one hour to turn
them in without punishment.

04:03.285 --> 04:05.286
After that, we'll be forced

04:05.495 --> 04:07.872
to consider you enemies
of the state.

04:10.042 --> 04:12.543
I'm asking you,

04:12.753 --> 04:16.255
please do what's right
for your people,

04:16.465 --> 04:18.257
our people,

04:18.467 --> 04:22.929
so that we can all take
our rightful place

04:23.138 --> 04:24.138
on the ground.

04:25.599 --> 04:26.849
We're almost home.

04:31.813 --> 04:33.481
What are they doing?

04:33.690 --> 04:36.067
Preparing to attack.

04:36.276 --> 04:37.902
They're too close
for missiles, sir,

04:38.111 --> 04:39.528
and without the veil,

04:39.738 --> 04:42.114
there is nothing we can
do from the inside.

04:42.324 --> 04:46.244
All ground units are ready to engage
on your command.

04:46.453 --> 04:47.787
Not yet.

04:47.996 --> 04:49.205
Sir, the longer we wait--

04:49.414 --> 04:51.832
they came looking
for a fight, Emerson.

04:52.042 --> 04:55.127
Doesn't mean we need
to give them one.

04:55.337 --> 04:57.171
As long as we're
behind the doors,

04:57.381 --> 05:00.591
they can't touch us.

05:00.801 --> 05:02.969
And what about
the intruder?

05:03.178 --> 05:04.595
He is still
at large, sir.

05:04.805 --> 05:07.181
We're doing everything
we can--

05:07.391 --> 05:10.893
45! Go door to door!

05:11.103 --> 05:12.270
Find them.

05:21.530 --> 05:22.571
Yes?

05:22.781 --> 05:24.407
Step aside, please.

05:24.616 --> 05:26.075
Why? What's wrong?

05:27.703 --> 05:29.495
We'll just be
a moment.

05:33.458 --> 05:34.625
If you tell us what
you're looking for,

05:34.835 --> 05:36.460
maybe we can
help you.

05:36.670 --> 05:38.337
You know what
we're looking for.

05:38.547 --> 05:40.089
Honestly,
we don't know.

05:42.509 --> 05:43.926
According
to your neighbors,

05:44.136 --> 05:46.554
you've been bringing
extra food home after meals.

05:46.763 --> 05:47.972
That's not true.

05:48.181 --> 05:49.807
Is it true that
you've refused treatment

05:50.017 --> 05:53.686
12 times
in the past 15 years

05:53.895 --> 05:56.355
or that you've refused
them 30 times?

05:56.565 --> 05:57.815
Do you deny that?

05:58.025 --> 05:59.775
We take the blood
when we need it.

05:59.985 --> 06:01.861
We don't take
extra food.

06:02.070 --> 06:03.738
Then you've got
nothing to worry about.

06:19.504 --> 06:20.796
Where are they?

06:21.006 --> 06:22.131
Just hold it!

06:22.341 --> 06:24.091
You have 5 seconds
to cooperate!

06:24.301 --> 06:26.427
1...

06:26.636 --> 06:28.512
2...

06:28.722 --> 06:29.430
3...

06:29.639 --> 06:30.681
Please. Don't do this!

06:30.891 --> 06:31.682
4...

06:31.892 --> 06:32.725
5!

06:32.934 --> 06:33.726
Wait, wait!

06:33.935 --> 06:35.770
Wait. Please
don't shoot.

06:35.979 --> 06:37.438
We're here, OK?

06:37.647 --> 06:39.565
Just leave them
alone.

06:39.775 --> 06:40.941
I'm so sorry.

06:41.151 --> 06:43.319
This is tilling.
Just found two more.

06:43.528 --> 06:45.071
We're bringing
them in now.

06:47.491 --> 06:48.574
Aah!

07:27.322 --> 07:29.865
Welcome,
sky crew.

07:30.075 --> 07:31.450
Join us.

07:38.542 --> 07:39.708
A package from raven.

07:39.918 --> 07:42.336
Hydrazine. She said
it would do the job.

07:42.546 --> 07:43.921
Good.

07:44.131 --> 07:47.174
And, uh, your mother
wanted to be here, too.

07:47.384 --> 07:48.551
I know,

07:48.760 --> 07:54.807
but the wounded
in Tondc need her more.

07:55.016 --> 07:56.100
Field commanders,

07:56.309 --> 08:00.354
today's the day we
get our people back.

08:00.564 --> 08:02.731
The enemy thinks
it's safe behind its doors,

08:02.941 --> 08:04.191
but it's not.

08:04.401 --> 08:07.778
When it realizes that,
it will fight back...

08:07.988 --> 08:09.613
Hard.

08:09.823 --> 08:11.157
We need to be ready.

08:15.537 --> 08:17.872
This is a rescue mission.

08:18.081 --> 08:21.125
We are not here
to wipe them out.

08:21.334 --> 08:23.752
There are people
inside that Mountain

08:23.962 --> 08:26.172
that have helped us,

08:26.381 --> 08:29.800
children who have nothing
to do with this war.

08:30.010 --> 08:31.760
We kill their soldiers,

08:31.970 --> 08:33.804
their leadership
if we have to,

08:34.014 --> 08:37.183
but we are there
to rescue our people.

08:37.392 --> 08:39.226
Is that clear?

08:42.314 --> 08:43.898
Then let's begin.

08:45.442 --> 08:47.151
There are 4 teams.

08:47.360 --> 08:49.987
Two of them--at the dam
and in the mine--

08:50.197 --> 08:52.156
are moving into
position already.

08:55.744 --> 08:57.661
The third--
inside the Mountain--

08:57.871 --> 09:01.123
is freeing the grounder
prisoners as we speak.

09:01.333 --> 09:03.876
It is our job
as the fourth team

09:04.085 --> 09:06.462
to keep the eyes
of the enemy off of them

09:06.671 --> 09:08.797
for as long as possible.

09:09.007 --> 09:11.425
To do that, we have to be
in position here

09:11.635 --> 09:15.221
at the main door
with our entire army.

09:15.430 --> 09:16.972
The Mountain men believe
the door

09:17.182 --> 09:18.557
can't be opened
from the outside,

09:18.767 --> 09:20.643
so they leave it unguarded.

09:20.852 --> 09:22.520
Only it can be,

09:22.729 --> 09:24.313
and thanks to our source
on the inside,

09:24.523 --> 09:26.398
now we know how.

09:26.608 --> 09:27.691
According to Maya,

09:27.901 --> 09:29.193
the electromagnetic
locking system

09:29.402 --> 09:31.278
has one flaw.

09:31.488 --> 09:34.281
When the power goes out,
it disengages.

09:34.491 --> 09:36.659
That's where raven's
team comes in.

09:36.868 --> 09:39.620
The Mountain's electricity
is generated at Philpott Dam.

09:42.499 --> 09:44.375
By now, they've
taken the turbine room.

09:46.211 --> 09:47.044
Go cover the door.

09:47.254 --> 09:48.337
You sure
he's alone?

09:52.384 --> 09:54.593
It's their job
to blow the power.

09:54.803 --> 09:56.136
Once they do,

09:56.346 --> 09:59.098
we blow the lock.

09:59.307 --> 10:00.975
There is a catch,

10:01.184 --> 10:03.894
a backup generator
inside the Mountain.

10:04.104 --> 10:06.063
If the lock is
still functioning

10:06.273 --> 10:08.274
when that
backup power kicks in,

10:08.483 --> 10:11.277
we'll never get
that door open,

10:11.486 --> 10:14.613
we'll never get our people back.

10:14.823 --> 10:15.739
How much time
do we have

10:15.949 --> 10:17.324
until the backup
power kicks in?

10:17.534 --> 10:19.201
One minute.

10:19.411 --> 10:20.619
That's the window.

10:20.829 --> 10:22.246
Small window.

10:22.455 --> 10:24.790
Why don't we just take out
the backup generator, too?

10:25.000 --> 10:26.875
Bellamy's inside.
Have him do it.

10:27.085 --> 10:28.252
Leaving them without power
that long

10:28.461 --> 10:29.461
would kill them all,

10:29.671 --> 10:32.172
and as I said,
that's not the mission.

10:34.217 --> 10:36.218
Besides, we lost contact
with Bellamy.

10:36.428 --> 10:38.387
What?
We did? When?

10:38.597 --> 10:40.681
After he took out
the acid fog.

10:40.890 --> 10:43.225
Bellamy's a warrior.
He'll be fine.

10:46.896 --> 10:48.480
As the commander said,

10:48.690 --> 10:51.191
once the door is open,
the shooting will start,

10:51.401 --> 10:53.611
and they'll throw
everything they have at us,

10:53.820 --> 10:55.446
but that's what we want.

10:55.655 --> 10:58.073
We want them looking at us

10:58.283 --> 11:00.909
because while we're fighting
at the front door,

11:01.119 --> 11:04.413
Indra's team will be escorting
the prisoners out the back,

11:04.623 --> 11:08.375
right through
the reaper tunnels.

11:08.585 --> 11:10.377
Once all our people
are free,

11:10.587 --> 11:11.837
they'll sound
the retreat.

11:12.047 --> 11:13.881
We'll be back home
before Mount Weather

11:14.090 --> 11:16.800
even knows they're gone,

11:17.010 --> 11:18.594
and that's it.

11:18.803 --> 11:20.929
That's the plan.

11:29.439 --> 11:31.857
The Mountain has cast
a shadow over these woods

11:32.067 --> 11:34.276
for too long.

11:34.486 --> 11:35.694
They've hunted us,

11:35.904 --> 11:37.529
controlled us,

11:37.739 --> 11:39.823
turned us into monsters.

11:40.033 --> 11:42.951
That ends today.

11:43.161 --> 11:45.037
Thanks to our alliance
with the sky people,

11:45.246 --> 11:48.749
the Mountain will fall.

11:48.958 --> 11:51.377
As Clarke said,
we spare the innocent.

11:51.586 --> 11:52.795
As for the guilty...

12:10.897 --> 12:14.274
Jus dren jus daun!
Jus dren jus daun!

12:37.424 --> 12:39.383
Out of the way, Vincent.

12:39.592 --> 12:41.051
That's my daughter.

12:41.261 --> 12:42.469
Dad, don't.

12:42.679 --> 12:44.346
Quiet. She's been
aiding and abetting

12:44.556 --> 12:46.849
the outsiders.

12:47.058 --> 12:49.143
You need to get out
of our way.

12:49.352 --> 12:51.353
I won't let you
take her, Paul.

12:51.563 --> 12:52.855
Listen carefully.

12:53.064 --> 12:54.523
We've got orders.

12:54.733 --> 12:56.066
She knows
where they're hiding.

12:56.276 --> 13:00.070
Now step aside.
I'm not gonna ask you again.

13:00.280 --> 13:01.989
If you want her,
you got to go through me.

13:02.198 --> 13:05.159
Dad, please.
They'll kill you.

13:05.368 --> 13:08.162
Don't make me
do this, Vincent.

13:08.371 --> 13:09.705
Sorry, Paul.

13:18.757 --> 13:20.215
Hyah!

13:26.639 --> 13:28.348
Hey. Good job.

13:28.558 --> 13:29.391
Thank you.

13:29.601 --> 13:31.143
Miller, you OK?

13:31.352 --> 13:32.603
Better than him.

13:32.812 --> 13:34.271
Need to get everyone
into the harvest chamber.

13:34.481 --> 13:35.439
You'll be safer there.

13:35.648 --> 13:36.899
Safe in the harvest
chamber?

13:37.108 --> 13:38.275
Just trust me.

13:38.485 --> 13:39.276
Are the others
there?

13:39.486 --> 13:40.319
Not yet.

13:40.528 --> 13:41.695
Monty?

13:41.905 --> 13:43.322
Monty's with the other
group on level 3.

13:43.531 --> 13:45.157
Don't worry. We moved him
after the last sweep.

13:45.366 --> 13:46.408
You should go
there next.

13:46.618 --> 13:47.534
All right. Go on.
Vincent will take you.

13:47.744 --> 13:48.702
I won't be long.

13:48.912 --> 13:50.871
Hey! I'm coming
with you.

13:51.080 --> 13:51.955
- Jasper.
- I promised

13:52.165 --> 13:53.248
I'd protect them.

13:53.458 --> 13:55.042
That's exactly
what I'm gonna do.

13:55.251 --> 13:56.293
Let's go.

13:59.506 --> 14:00.672
Maya.

14:02.926 --> 14:04.092
I'll be OK.

14:09.224 --> 14:11.308
Your mother would be
so proud.

14:13.812 --> 14:15.020
See you soon.

14:18.107 --> 14:19.233
Be careful.

14:20.819 --> 14:21.944
You, too.

14:25.365 --> 14:26.532
Let's go.

14:27.659 --> 14:28.826
Come on,
come on, come on.

14:35.166 --> 14:36.375
According to
Lincoln's map,

14:36.584 --> 14:38.335
we're getting close.

14:41.297 --> 14:42.923
It's a maze.

14:43.132 --> 14:44.800
Lincoln should be
here to show us the way.

14:45.009 --> 14:47.052
He wasn't ready.
Even he knew that.

14:47.262 --> 14:49.805
He'll do well fighting
with the commander.

14:50.014 --> 14:51.682
It meant a lot that
you forgave him.

14:51.891 --> 14:54.017
He earned that.

14:54.227 --> 14:56.186
I have known Lincoln
since he was a boy.

14:56.396 --> 14:58.605
He always questioned
our ways,

14:58.815 --> 15:01.066
but if he ever chooses sides
against the clan again,

15:01.276 --> 15:03.193
not even his bravery
can save him.

15:05.530 --> 15:06.446
Stop shooting!

15:06.656 --> 15:08.615
Reapers are not
the enemy!

15:13.746 --> 15:16.290
We don't kill them
unless we--

15:18.751 --> 15:19.543
Now!

15:21.546 --> 15:22.713
Tranquilize them.

15:22.922 --> 15:23.964
Go for the jugular!

15:27.260 --> 15:30.596
Secure their hands and feet.

15:30.805 --> 15:31.847
Well done.

15:32.056 --> 15:34.057
They'll be out
for a while.

15:35.310 --> 15:36.852
We'll come back
for them.

15:45.028 --> 15:46.278
You know him?

15:48.406 --> 15:51.158
He'll be OK now.
Abby will help him.

16:01.920 --> 16:03.962
Let's go. We have
to find that door.

16:19.479 --> 16:21.063
That should do it.

16:21.272 --> 16:22.314
Bombs away.

16:25.735 --> 16:26.902
Be careful.

16:34.994 --> 16:37.287
Archers, watch the trees.

16:46.005 --> 16:49.007
Hey.
You can do this.

16:50.885 --> 16:51.885
What if we're
too late?

16:52.095 --> 16:53.553
What if we're not?

16:57.475 --> 16:59.101
Draw strength
from your son.

17:01.771 --> 17:02.771
This Mountain has
taken too much

17:02.981 --> 17:04.356
from both of us,
hasn't it?

17:26.170 --> 17:27.337
3 down,
2 to go.

17:29.882 --> 17:31.425
As soon as I'm done,
you set the detonator.

17:31.634 --> 17:33.343
I know the plan, raven.
It's my plan.

17:42.228 --> 17:45.439
Fine. Jeez. You can tell
me a damn joke already.

17:47.316 --> 17:50.193
Get it? "Dam" joke?

17:50.403 --> 17:52.404
I got it.

17:52.613 --> 17:54.156
Your jokes
are terrible.

17:54.365 --> 17:56.116
They are not.

17:56.325 --> 17:57.826
They are.

17:58.036 --> 18:01.246
Now concentrate.
We don't have all day.

18:01.456 --> 18:04.291
I think I liked you
better before we had sex.

18:04.500 --> 18:06.001
Right back at you.

18:08.629 --> 18:11.882
They can't leave if you
push them away first, right?

18:15.720 --> 18:17.345
How's that working
out for you so far?

18:21.100 --> 18:22.601
I'll get started
on number 5.

18:27.899 --> 18:29.649
402, please report. Over.

18:29.859 --> 18:32.319
Where did that
come from?

18:32.528 --> 18:34.529
Whose is it?

18:34.739 --> 18:36.865
402, please report. Over.

18:38.076 --> 18:39.493
Wick, watch out!

18:45.416 --> 18:47.709
This is 402.
We got intruders in the dam!

18:49.378 --> 18:50.629
Come again, 402.

18:50.838 --> 18:52.297
Did you say intruders?

18:52.507 --> 18:53.965
402, are you there?

18:54.175 --> 18:55.092
Backup is on the way.

18:55.301 --> 18:56.218
They know we're here.

18:56.427 --> 18:57.552
Wick, they're sending
backup.

18:57.762 --> 18:59.179
We have to do
this fast.

19:04.227 --> 19:05.602
Welcome to the ground.

19:09.398 --> 19:10.899
Give me the last bomb.

19:17.073 --> 19:19.116
What happens if we
only blow up 4 of the 5?

19:19.325 --> 19:20.909
The power stays on,

19:21.119 --> 19:22.327
door stays locked,

19:22.537 --> 19:24.412
everyone we care
about dies.

19:37.176 --> 19:39.010
I had them prepare
your food.

19:50.106 --> 19:52.023
Come on, dad.

19:52.233 --> 19:56.736
They tell me you
haven't eaten in two days.

19:56.946 --> 19:58.238
How bad is it?

20:00.199 --> 20:04.244
We both know you aren't
here to bring me dinner.

20:05.454 --> 20:06.538
It's bad.

20:09.125 --> 20:11.251
They're going
after our power.

20:13.462 --> 20:15.922
I sent a team out
to the dam,

20:16.132 --> 20:18.758
but there is an army outside
of our main door,

20:18.968 --> 20:22.095
and they're drilling
into it.

20:22.305 --> 20:24.306
They must know that
there's a delay.

20:31.898 --> 20:34.399
I underestimated
the commander.

20:36.694 --> 20:37.903
Is that what you
need me to say?

20:38.112 --> 20:43.617
It wasn't the commander.
It was Clarke.

20:43.826 --> 20:44.701
Dad.

20:44.911 --> 20:47.245
You've killed us.

20:47.455 --> 20:50.457
One week in office,
and you've managed

20:50.666 --> 20:52.834
to turn neighbor
against neighbor,

20:53.044 --> 20:56.338
you've made the outsiders
hate us more than they already did,

20:56.547 --> 20:59.341
you've lost
our outer defenses,

20:59.550 --> 21:03.803
and now a door that hasn't been
breached in 97 years

21:04.013 --> 21:05.639
is going to fall,

21:05.848 --> 21:08.099
and an army of savages

21:08.309 --> 21:10.185
is going to flood
these halls,

21:10.394 --> 21:12.520
killing every
last one of us.

21:17.276 --> 21:18.860
Tell me
how to stop it.

21:24.242 --> 21:25.283
Please.

21:27.828 --> 21:29.412
I need your help.

21:38.047 --> 21:40.799
Your people

21:41.008 --> 21:42.259
need your help.

21:59.777 --> 22:01.987
They'll destroy everything.

22:07.618 --> 22:09.661
You already have.

22:24.635 --> 22:25.719
Wait.

22:37.898 --> 22:38.815
Wick, stop.

22:39.025 --> 22:40.108
I'm not doing anything.

22:40.318 --> 22:41.651
Exactly.

22:41.861 --> 22:43.111
Hey. I'm not the one that
didn't make enough bombs.

22:43.321 --> 22:44.404
5 turbines,
5 bombs.

22:44.613 --> 22:46.323
Maybe if you didn't
drop the last one--

22:46.532 --> 22:48.742
oh, any engineer worth his salt
knows to plan for failure.

22:48.951 --> 22:50.910
Two is one, one is none.
It's called--

22:51.120 --> 22:52.579
Redundancy.

22:52.788 --> 22:54.372
That's it.
Redundancy.

22:54.582 --> 22:55.707
That--that--
that's it!

22:55.916 --> 22:57.167
Whoa! What is?
What are you doing?

22:57.376 --> 22:58.668
They built more turbines than
they needed.

22:58.878 --> 23:00.337
We blow the other 4,
this won't take a load.

23:00.546 --> 23:02.380
Surge protectors
will ramp it down to keep it running--

23:02.590 --> 23:04.090
to keep it
from blowing up.

23:04.300 --> 23:07.218
Yeah. We need to shut
down this turbine, wick.

23:07.428 --> 23:09.596
Catastrophic failure?
That's your plan?

23:09.805 --> 23:10.847
OK. When you say it
like that,

23:11.057 --> 23:12.640
it doesn't sound like
such a good idea.

23:12.850 --> 23:14.184
I'll set
the detonators.

23:25.363 --> 23:26.905
It's taking too long.

23:29.450 --> 23:31.242
It takes as long
as it takes.

23:35.289 --> 23:37.040
What will you
when it's over?

23:40.795 --> 23:42.337
I have no idea.

23:44.048 --> 23:45.340
Well, what
do you want?

23:50.012 --> 23:51.221
Nothing.

23:53.057 --> 23:55.558
My people back.

23:55.768 --> 23:57.644
I can't think
past today.

24:01.148 --> 24:03.108
You should come with me
to the capital.

24:06.821 --> 24:10.448
Polis will change the way
you think about us.

24:10.658 --> 24:13.743
You already have.

24:18.916 --> 24:20.333
It's coming
from the dam.

24:20.584 --> 24:21.751
They know we're going
for the power.

24:21.961 --> 24:24.003
They know we're
going for the door.

24:27.842 --> 24:29.592
Raven will get
it done.

24:29.802 --> 24:31.261
She's one of us.

24:32.721 --> 24:33.596
As soon as
those lights go off,

24:33.806 --> 24:34.681
you push that button.

24:34.890 --> 24:36.224
We'll do the rest.

24:39.854 --> 24:41.271
Today, wick!

24:41.480 --> 24:42.939
I'm moving as fast
as I--

24:45.568 --> 24:46.734
Actually, I can
go faster.

24:50.364 --> 24:51.281
Did you get it done?

24:51.490 --> 24:53.116
Push the damn button,
raven!

24:57.204 --> 24:59.622
It's working!

24:59.832 --> 25:01.374
We're too close. Wick!

25:01.584 --> 25:04.002
Freeze!
Hands up!

25:04.211 --> 25:07.046
Don't move!
Show me your hands!

25:09.508 --> 25:10.383
Just keep
backing up.

25:13.220 --> 25:15.054
Stop moving
right now.

25:15.264 --> 25:16.848
We're still too close.

25:17.057 --> 25:18.308
Not as close
as they are.

25:21.479 --> 25:22.312
Get down!

25:43.459 --> 25:45.877
OK, Emerson.

25:46.086 --> 25:47.003
They got the power.

25:47.213 --> 25:49.005
Start the clock.
One minute.

25:49.215 --> 25:50.798
Copy that.
Don't worry, sir.

25:51.008 --> 25:54.636
They're not getting
anywhere near that door.

25:56.972 --> 25:57.805
She did it.

25:58.015 --> 25:59.390
One minute
starting now.

26:03.103 --> 26:04.729
For those we've lost...

26:08.359 --> 26:09.901
And those we'll
soon find.

26:16.909 --> 26:18.785
What's wrong?
Why isn't it working?

26:18.994 --> 26:20.578
They're jamming us.

26:20.788 --> 26:21.788
I have to get closer.

26:23.374 --> 26:24.290
Clarke!

26:26.502 --> 26:27.585
45 seconds!

26:40.933 --> 26:42.267
If I can get there,
I can trigger it manually.

26:42.476 --> 26:43.935
No. You can't
get there.

26:44.144 --> 26:45.520
For Nate,
I have to try.

26:50.067 --> 26:50.942
Go. Go with them.

26:58.075 --> 26:59.576
30 seconds!

27:11.714 --> 27:13.089
Aah!

27:23.809 --> 27:25.476
We'll find
another way in.

27:25.686 --> 27:27.520
There is no
other way in.

27:27.730 --> 27:28.896
You know that.

27:29.106 --> 27:30.315
We don't need one.

27:33.694 --> 27:34.611
10 seconds.

27:36.989 --> 27:37.989
5 seconds.

27:38.198 --> 27:40.116
4, 3,

27:40.326 --> 27:42.493
2, 1.

27:45.205 --> 27:46.873
Ha ha! It worked!

27:47.082 --> 27:48.374
We need to get
to that Ridge

27:48.584 --> 27:50.168
and take out
the shooters.

27:50.377 --> 27:52.420
No! You stay
with Clarke.

27:52.630 --> 27:55.465
When the shooting stops,
you get that door open.

28:16.445 --> 28:17.612
We don't have much time.

28:17.821 --> 28:20.281
The last 12 are
on this level.

28:20.491 --> 28:21.491
Including Monty.

28:21.700 --> 28:22.742
Which way?

28:22.951 --> 28:24.452
This way.

28:24.662 --> 28:25.870
Attention.
Class one quarantine protocols

28:26.080 --> 28:27.789
are now in effect.

28:27.998 --> 28:30.750
All citizens must report
to level 5 immediately.

28:30.959 --> 28:33.419
Hard seal lockdown
in t-minus 30 minutes and counting.

28:33.629 --> 28:34.462
Listen to me.

28:34.672 --> 28:35.963
It's gonna be OK.

28:36.173 --> 28:37.715
All right?
You're gonna be OK.

28:37.925 --> 28:40.301
We're not gonna let
anything happen to you, will we?

28:40.511 --> 28:43.179
Jasper, in 30 minutes,
all backup power gets diverted

28:43.389 --> 28:45.181
for species continuity.

28:45.391 --> 28:47.767
That means level 5
for life support and security.

28:47.976 --> 28:50.269
Radiation will seep
in everywhere else.

28:50.479 --> 28:51.646
I can't go
to level 5

28:51.855 --> 28:54.607
without being shot
in the head.

28:54.817 --> 28:57.110
Guys, we need to
keep moving.

28:57.319 --> 28:59.320
We'll get you
your Hazmat suit,

28:59.530 --> 29:00.822
extra oxygen,
enough to last

29:01.031 --> 29:02.365
until the engineers
get the power back on.

29:02.574 --> 29:03.574
And then what?

29:03.784 --> 29:05.034
You think Cage Wallace
is gonna let me

29:05.285 --> 29:06.369
live here after that?

29:06.578 --> 29:08.996
Attention. Class one
quarantine protocols are now...

29:09.206 --> 29:10.206
Then we kill him.

29:10.416 --> 29:11.749
All citizens
must report

29:11.959 --> 29:13.835
to level 5 immediately.

29:14.044 --> 29:16.087
Hard seal lockdown
in t-minus...

29:18.507 --> 29:19.549
Monty.

29:19.758 --> 29:22.051
Move!
You heard him. Let's go.

29:22.261 --> 29:23.678
Slow, slow.

29:23.887 --> 29:25.054
Be ready
for anything.

29:38.819 --> 29:40.153
It's Mrs. Ryan.

29:42.865 --> 29:44.824
She was hiding
the last 12.

29:45.033 --> 29:46.451
Where'd they take them?

29:46.660 --> 29:48.828
It's got to be
level 5.

29:49.037 --> 29:49.871
No.

29:50.080 --> 29:51.205
Get out of my way.

29:51.415 --> 29:52.623
Every person
inside this Mountain

29:52.833 --> 29:54.542
is on level 5,

29:54.752 --> 29:56.377
every soldier.

29:56.587 --> 29:57.253
Tell him.

29:57.463 --> 29:58.921
Jasper's right.

29:59.131 --> 30:00.381
After the lockdown,

30:00.591 --> 30:01.841
it'll be almost impossible
to get them out.

30:02.050 --> 30:03.426
It's now or never.

30:05.596 --> 30:07.430
All right,

30:07.639 --> 30:08.598
but how do we
even get--

30:13.437 --> 30:15.855
Monty.

30:16.064 --> 30:19.692
What is it?
What's wrong?

30:19.902 --> 30:22.987
They know
about the grounders.

30:23.197 --> 30:24.781
That's why I hid.

30:24.990 --> 30:27.074
I-I didn't do anything
to save the others.

30:27.284 --> 30:30.036
I let them kill
Mrs. Ryan.

30:30.245 --> 30:31.954
What do you mean they
know about the grounders?

30:32.164 --> 30:34.749
It was on
a soldier's walkie.

30:34.958 --> 30:38.753
They're going for
the harvest chamber.

30:38.962 --> 30:41.047
If they take it,
we lose everyone.

30:41.256 --> 30:43.966
Attention.
Class one quarantine...

30:45.719 --> 30:46.594
Come on!

30:47.888 --> 30:48.763
Come on.

30:57.981 --> 30:59.106
We found it.

30:59.316 --> 31:01.108
You found it.

31:01.318 --> 31:05.571
It appears we didn't
need Lincoln after all.

31:05.781 --> 31:06.656
Thank you.

31:08.784 --> 31:10.493
You've done well,
Octavia.

31:15.082 --> 31:16.457
What does that mean?

31:16.667 --> 31:18.376
What do you think
it means?

31:18.585 --> 31:21.128
I think I want to
hear you say it.

31:21.338 --> 31:23.172
You're one of us now.

31:37.354 --> 31:38.271
Lincoln.

31:40.732 --> 31:43.985
Lexa did it.

31:44.194 --> 31:45.820
Clarke, look.

31:48.866 --> 31:50.366
Make sure he's OK.

31:50.576 --> 31:51.409
Sergeant Miller!

31:54.496 --> 31:57.623
They'll be waiting
just inside the door.

31:57.833 --> 31:58.708
Good.

32:10.846 --> 32:12.889
Train your fire
on the door.

32:14.558 --> 32:15.433
Pull!

32:22.941 --> 32:24.317
Pull!

32:29.156 --> 32:30.698
Again! Pull!

32:41.960 --> 32:43.169
Attack now!

32:52.471 --> 32:53.638
What is this?

32:53.847 --> 32:55.514
Hey, look!
They're coming out!

33:09.279 --> 33:10.529
They're
surrendering?

33:10.739 --> 33:12.073
Not quite.

33:26.463 --> 33:27.630
What did you do?

33:29.216 --> 33:31.300
What you would
have done.

33:31.510 --> 33:32.927
Saved my people.

33:36.139 --> 33:38.766
Where are my people?

33:38.976 --> 33:41.143
I'm sorry, Clarke.

33:41.353 --> 33:43.312
They weren't part
of the deal.

33:54.783 --> 33:56.617
You made the right
choice, commander.

34:15.595 --> 34:17.763
What is this?

34:17.973 --> 34:19.890
Your commander's
made a deal.

34:22.269 --> 34:25.062
What about prisoners
from the ark?

34:25.272 --> 34:27.273
They'll all
be killed...

34:29.609 --> 34:31.152
But you don't care
about that, do you?

34:31.361 --> 34:34.905
I do care, Clarke,

34:35.115 --> 34:36.407
but I made this choice
with my head

34:36.616 --> 34:38.451
and not my heart.

34:40.537 --> 34:44.457
The duty to protect
my people comes first.

34:44.666 --> 34:47.084
Please don't
do this.

34:47.294 --> 34:48.461
I'm sorry, Clarke.

34:48.670 --> 34:49.837
Commander, not like this.
Let us fight.

34:50.047 --> 34:51.714
No. The deal is done.

35:08.940 --> 35:10.232
You, too.

35:10.442 --> 35:11.692
All our people withdraw.

35:11.902 --> 35:13.110
Those are the terms.

35:13.320 --> 35:15.488
They'll be slaughtered.
Let me help them.

35:35.092 --> 35:36.675
We will meet again.

36:09.751 --> 36:11.168
We're retreating.

36:11.378 --> 36:13.003
That can't be right.

36:13.213 --> 36:15.631
We have to go now.

36:15.841 --> 36:17.758
Indra, wait!

36:17.968 --> 36:18.968
They're still
in there.

36:19.177 --> 36:20.427
And our commander's
out there,

36:20.637 --> 36:22.888
under attack
for all we know.

36:23.098 --> 36:24.932
I don't trust her,

36:25.142 --> 36:27.434
not after Tondc,

36:27.644 --> 36:28.769
and neither
should you.

36:28.979 --> 36:31.522
I gave you
a direct order.

36:31.731 --> 36:35.651
Please. This was
the plan.

36:35.861 --> 36:37.278
If we're not here
with the tone generators

36:37.487 --> 36:38.737
when they come out,
reapers will kill--

36:38.947 --> 36:41.031
plans change.

36:41.241 --> 36:43.826
Octavia,
let's go.

36:48.373 --> 36:50.624
I'm not going anywhere
without my brother.

37:01.428 --> 37:04.972
You are no longer
my second.

37:25.118 --> 37:27.912
Octavia, please.

37:28.121 --> 37:29.413
Come home with us.

37:32.542 --> 37:34.210
I have no home.

37:40.383 --> 37:41.842
You'll need this.

37:43.428 --> 37:44.303
Come on.

37:59.694 --> 38:00.903
No!

38:34.938 --> 38:36.188
Raven?

38:40.402 --> 38:42.695
Raven. Hey.

38:44.072 --> 38:46.323
Ugh! My arm. Ow.

38:49.035 --> 38:50.244
Hey.

39:00.088 --> 39:01.797
I'm just saying,

39:02.007 --> 39:03.757
my brace
would have held.

39:09.180 --> 39:12.599
Come on. Let's get
out of here.

39:12.809 --> 39:14.351
Agh.

39:16.730 --> 39:17.646
Kyle--

39:17.856 --> 39:19.148
no. No way.

39:19.357 --> 39:20.566
Don't even say it.

39:20.775 --> 39:23.902
I'm not going
anywhere without you.

39:24.112 --> 39:28.198
What I was
gonna say is...

39:28.408 --> 39:30.367
Please don't
leave me.

39:34.998 --> 39:35.998
Not a chance.

39:37.542 --> 39:38.417
There you are.

39:40.795 --> 39:41.920
Tac Team 5.

39:42.130 --> 39:44.048
Tell the president
the turbines are down.

39:58.688 --> 39:59.730
Dad?

40:02.567 --> 40:04.902
You were right.

40:05.111 --> 40:07.571
She took the deal.

40:07.781 --> 40:09.948
You're a hero
to your people.

40:11.618 --> 40:13.494
We've won.

40:13.703 --> 40:17.873
No, we haven't.
Not yet.

40:18.083 --> 40:21.543
Peace with the savages
isn't enough

40:21.753 --> 40:24.963
to make the ground
safe for us.

40:25.173 --> 40:27.383
I know.

40:27.592 --> 40:29.385
The ark.

40:29.594 --> 40:32.471
They'll never stop.

40:32.680 --> 40:35.057
No parent
ever would.

40:35.266 --> 40:36.850
You're right.
20 minutes ago,

40:37.060 --> 40:40.104
we picked up
a small group on radar.

40:40.313 --> 40:42.147
I already have
a team on the way.

40:47.153 --> 40:49.530
Looks like we're gonna
have more bone marrow.

40:56.538 --> 40:59.206
We'll be on level 5
until the turbines are fixed.

40:59.416 --> 41:01.166
Come down
when you're ready.

41:19.185 --> 41:20.978
David, distant:
Clarke, let's go.

41:21.187 --> 41:23.188
We'll come back
with reinforcements.

41:26.067 --> 41:27.401
Clarke.

41:27.610 --> 41:28.861
Clarke, come on.

41:32.240 --> 41:33.824
It's over.

41:34.033 --> 41:35.367
I'm sorry.

41:48.006 --> 41:49.590
It can't be over.
