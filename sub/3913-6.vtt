00:00.075 --> 00:02.268
(Datak) Previously on <i>Defiance</i>...

00:02.302 --> 00:03.503
We are a lie

00:03.537 --> 00:05.438
that's kept us together
for all these years.

00:05.471 --> 00:07.140
What lie? I never lied to you.

00:07.174 --> 00:09.275
You taught me to believe we're the same.

00:09.309 --> 00:11.684
Yeah, we both grew up
with blood on our hands.

00:11.704 --> 00:14.847
It made you okay with killing, but not me.

00:15.372 --> 00:16.572
Would you kill this human,

00:16.573 --> 00:18.675
in exchange for your husband's life?

00:20.555 --> 00:21.977
[yells]

00:21.978 --> 00:23.378
- Ah!
- No!

00:23.413 --> 00:27.549
When I close my eyes, I can only
picture Alak as a little boy.

00:27.583 --> 00:31.386
I keep remembering this one
day we encountered a hellbug.

00:31.421 --> 00:34.690
I grabbed Alak in my arms and I ran.

00:34.724 --> 00:37.526
(Stahma) I held my son
close and I whispered,

00:37.560 --> 00:39.661
"I will always protect you."

00:39.696 --> 00:41.930
Now I realize that was a lie.

00:42.498 --> 00:45.801
[both grunting]

00:52.608 --> 00:54.242
[laughs]

00:59.115 --> 01:00.982
[both scream]

01:01.017 --> 01:02.384
You killed Christie.

01:03.553 --> 01:05.620
- I-I did it to save you...
- Shut your lying mouth!

01:05.655 --> 01:09.224
Always an excuse. You've
never told the truth.

01:09.258 --> 01:11.193
[whimpers]

01:11.227 --> 01:12.494
Alak?

01:17.600 --> 01:19.434
[screams]

01:25.675 --> 01:28.009
[grunts]

01:28.044 --> 01:32.114

01:32.148 --> 01:33.915
Ah!

01:36.085 --> 01:39.087
[both grunting]

01:42.852 --> 01:44.220
Don't hurt him!

02:01.511 --> 02:03.621
Do I have your attention?

02:04.347 --> 02:05.657
Good.

02:06.182 --> 02:10.273
You, my child, have been favored.

02:10.282 --> 02:12.021
Indulged.

02:12.678 --> 02:15.880
I supported your choices.

02:15.959 --> 02:19.661
I embraced Christie as my <i>hanya tavo</i>

02:19.720 --> 02:23.367
and convinced your father
to accept the marriage.

02:23.555 --> 02:27.831
While you were captured, I
thought of nothing but you.

02:28.044 --> 02:31.235
I destroyed the arch and betrayed my town

02:31.307 --> 02:33.673
to protect you from harm!

02:34.672 --> 02:36.218
Christie.

02:36.889 --> 02:39.824
Christie chose death.

02:39.891 --> 02:43.460
She did it to save your child.

02:43.597 --> 02:46.266
She was a mother who sacrificed everything

02:46.300 --> 02:48.435
for her bloodline.

02:48.469 --> 02:50.370
[grunts]

02:50.404 --> 02:52.272
[spits]

02:52.306 --> 02:54.641
You ungrateful coward!

02:54.675 --> 02:57.644
It is you who has shamed our family.

03:00.715 --> 03:03.883
[baby cries]

03:03.918 --> 03:05.385
Luke?

03:05.419 --> 03:09.289
Is he alive? Oh, my God, Luke!

03:10.958 --> 03:12.959
[baby cries]

03:12.993 --> 03:18.365
Well, at least now we
know the wee one's name.

03:22.303 --> 03:24.486
Hurry, please! He's killing her!

03:25.573 --> 03:28.808
[baby cries]

03:28.843 --> 03:31.177
- Hand me a blanket.
- Yes, Favi.

03:33.080 --> 03:35.962
Luke is a fine name for a boy.

03:41.055 --> 03:42.422
What are you doing?

03:42.456 --> 03:45.168
Taking my son somewhere safe.

03:45.860 --> 03:47.660
Far away from you.

03:50.865 --> 03:54.333
- Move.
- I will not allow this.

03:57.035 --> 03:58.238
[speaking native language]

03:58.272 --> 04:00.607
Get out of my way, or I'll
kick you down the stairs.

04:00.641 --> 04:01.608
- Don't hurt the baby.
- Let's all calm down.

04:01.642 --> 04:02.609
[speaking native language]

04:02.643 --> 04:03.610
Not feeling very calm today, Dad.

04:03.644 --> 04:04.844
(Nolan) Alak Tarr!

04:04.845 --> 04:06.146
- It's the lawkeeper.
- Get rid of him.

04:06.180 --> 04:09.179
- I said step aside.
- Hey! Settle down.

04:10.751 --> 04:11.851
What's the problem here?

04:11.886 --> 04:13.219
There's no problem here.

04:13.254 --> 04:16.430
As you can see, we've
been reunited with our son.

04:17.458 --> 04:20.360
Andina tells me Alak
attacked Stahma with a knife.

04:20.394 --> 04:22.060
Andina is not a bright girl.

04:22.096 --> 04:24.624
Clearly, she was mistaken.

04:25.099 --> 04:27.901
Is that true, Andina? Were you mistaken?

04:27.935 --> 04:30.357
I get confused sometimes.

04:31.272 --> 04:33.992
This is a very emotional
moment for our family.

04:33.992 --> 04:37.043
If you wouldn't mind leaving
us alone to sort it all out.

04:37.296 --> 04:38.582
Hmm.

04:40.014 --> 04:41.714
And where have you been all this time?

04:41.749 --> 04:44.384
I was a prisoner in Rahm Tak's camp.

04:44.418 --> 04:45.973
I was there the day you and Irisa

04:45.973 --> 04:48.359
- took out the net-cutter.
- It was a terrifying ordeal.

04:48.385 --> 04:49.945
We're just learning of it now.

04:49.945 --> 04:51.274
I need to know everything you saw.

04:51.274 --> 04:53.235
My son will be happy
to share all the details

04:53.235 --> 04:55.995
with you once he's had
a hot bath and a meal.

04:56.030 --> 04:59.466
With his family. In private.

04:59.500 --> 05:02.920
They want you to leave so the three
of us can get our stories straight.

05:05.039 --> 05:07.707
You see, they're afraid
that I might contradict

05:07.741 --> 05:09.342
one of the many lies they have told you.

05:09.376 --> 05:11.611
Alak, stop talking.

05:16.884 --> 05:19.493
They're working as spies for the V.C.

05:20.020 --> 05:21.621
They blew up the arch.

05:23.190 --> 05:25.925
[both grunting]

05:28.796 --> 05:30.430
Go, go!

05:33.701 --> 05:36.503
Son of a bitch.

05:46.680 --> 05:49.649

05:59.660 --> 06:02.028
All right. Thank you.

06:02.062 --> 06:04.374
(Nolan) All right, good man.

06:05.299 --> 06:07.431
Okay, I think that's all of us.

06:07.701 --> 06:10.493
Okay, to all of those
of you who volunteered

06:10.494 --> 06:13.773
to help us with this manhunt, our
town thanks you for your service.

06:13.807 --> 06:17.043
Now as far as we know, our
fugitives are still in town.

06:17.077 --> 06:18.778
This gives us a radius of searching

06:18.812 --> 06:20.513
of at least five miles.

06:20.548 --> 06:22.549
People, I need you to
understand that apprehending

06:22.583 --> 06:25.257
Datak and Stahma Tarr is not about payback.

06:25.614 --> 06:27.956
You tell these people what you told me.

06:28.422 --> 06:31.790
Um, Rahm Tak is ready to make his move.

06:31.884 --> 06:33.092
I heard him bragging about it.

06:33.127 --> 06:34.894
- Can he succeed?
- Yeah.

06:34.929 --> 06:36.778
About a week after you guys bombed

06:36.778 --> 06:40.431
that net-cutter, I saw him buy a
truckload of weapons from an arms dealer.

06:40.431 --> 06:43.002
- Who? What was his name?
- I don't know.

06:43.037 --> 06:46.573
Uh, he was a blond guy, musk ox coat,

06:46.607 --> 06:48.479
Bioman bodyguard.

06:48.480 --> 06:51.344
The weapons had the Von
Bach Industries logo on them.

06:51.378 --> 06:56.573
So the enemy has Von Bach tech
and we've got, what, slingshots?

06:56.574 --> 07:00.310
People, Defiance Valley
is giant terraformed basin.

07:00.311 --> 07:01.702
There's only three ways in:

07:01.703 --> 07:04.151
through Bissel Pass, which we have sewn up

07:04.152 --> 07:06.834
with the stasis nets,
underground, possibly through

07:06.868 --> 07:09.170
either old St. Louis or through the mines,

07:09.204 --> 07:10.971
or through the mountains by foot

07:11.006 --> 07:13.074
or some sort of aerial assault.

07:13.108 --> 07:15.314
It's hard to prepare without
knowing the invasion plan.

07:15.314 --> 07:17.778
Which is exactly where
Datak and Stahma come in.

07:17.813 --> 07:19.482
They've been working as Rahm's spies,

07:19.482 --> 07:22.450
and thanks to Alak, we know
they've been in regular contact.

07:22.484 --> 07:26.454
So if anybody knows his
plans, it's the Tarrs.

07:26.488 --> 07:29.790
So our job is to find them, capture them,

07:29.825 --> 07:34.232
interrogate them, and find out
what that plan is. Do we understand?

07:34.232 --> 07:34.974
- (All) Yes.
- Yes, sir.

07:34.975 --> 07:37.131
Okay, we're gonna need
searches... house to house,

07:37.165 --> 07:38.955
street to street.

07:39.267 --> 07:42.381
Poole and Enriquez, your
job... search the Hollows.

07:42.382 --> 07:45.506
- What was that look?
- What look?

07:45.540 --> 07:47.641
When Alak was describing the arms dealer,

07:47.676 --> 07:49.794
you had a reaction.

07:50.946 --> 07:52.613
No reaction.

07:52.647 --> 07:54.702
We need to hear this.

07:55.183 --> 07:59.086
- Conrad's blond. Conrad Von Bach?
- Yes... okay, yes.

07:59.113 --> 08:01.314
Alak is clearly describing my ex-boyfriend,

08:01.315 --> 08:04.758
who is clearly selling
weapons to our greatest enemy.

08:04.793 --> 08:06.751
I'm angry and ashamed, but there's nothing

08:06.751 --> 08:08.295
I can do about it.

08:08.330 --> 08:10.729
Well, maybe he's still in
broadcast range. Call him.

08:10.729 --> 08:13.534
- Amanda and Berlin, you two take...
- (both) Darby Square.

08:13.535 --> 08:14.735
Thank you.

08:14.736 --> 08:16.604
I haven't spoken to him in two years.

08:16.638 --> 08:18.272
What am I supposed to say?

08:18.306 --> 08:20.641
Tell him Defiance wants to buy his product.

08:20.675 --> 08:23.043
The town can't afford his product.

08:23.078 --> 08:25.813
Well, maybe you leave that part out.

08:25.847 --> 08:28.716
Report to your team leaders
on the hour, every hour,

08:28.750 --> 08:30.551
and these searches both in the immediate

08:30.585 --> 08:33.386
and outlying areas, I
want to be in a logical

08:33.421 --> 08:34.822
and systematic manner.

08:34.856 --> 08:36.097
Alak, you're with me.

08:36.097 --> 08:38.501
Irisa, I need you to sit on the Tarr house

08:38.501 --> 08:41.337
on the off chance they double back
and try and snatch their grandson.

08:41.337 --> 08:42.730
People, let's do it by the numbers,

08:42.764 --> 08:44.465
clear, and intelligent.

08:44.499 --> 08:46.167
And be careful out there.

08:46.201 --> 08:49.270
You know, I'm... I'm perfectly
capable of guarding my own son.

08:49.304 --> 08:50.506
I said you're with me,

08:50.506 --> 08:53.140
and if you do spot the
Tarrs, do not engage them.

08:53.175 --> 08:54.922
Chirp me on my hailer, I'll come running.

08:54.922 --> 08:57.578
So I'm a babysitter now.

08:57.612 --> 09:00.292
It's a job that doesn't
require picking up a gun.

09:02.671 --> 09:03.875
Where are we going?

09:03.885 --> 09:05.123
I'll tell you when we get there.

09:05.123 --> 09:06.988
Why are you dragging me along?

09:07.322 --> 09:08.522
[Nolan sighs]

09:09.026 --> 09:11.734
In case your parents try and kill you.

09:12.363 --> 09:13.565
Oh...

09:16.781 --> 09:21.487
_

09:21.494 --> 09:25.296
_

09:28.414 --> 09:36.057
_

09:36.371 --> 09:38.612
_

09:45.227 --> 09:48.128
- Here.
- It's filthy.

09:48.163 --> 09:50.130
It's better to blend in.

09:50.165 --> 09:51.465
This won't work.

09:51.499 --> 09:53.569
They have the entire town looking for us.

09:53.569 --> 09:55.035
That's why we need to leave.

09:55.070 --> 09:57.850
I have weapons and cash hidden
in the garden by the Hollows.

09:57.850 --> 09:59.857
Retrieve them. I'll arrange for a roller

09:59.857 --> 10:01.822
and a way to get the stasis nets lowered.

10:01.822 --> 10:04.178
Meet me under the pedestrian
bridge in 90 minutes.

10:04.179 --> 10:06.910
- And if you are not there?
- I'll be there.

10:07.749 --> 10:09.550
What about the baby?

10:09.584 --> 10:10.979
He's better off with Alak.

10:10.979 --> 10:13.840
- No.
- A son belongs with his father.

10:15.023 --> 10:17.695
But we have each other, just like we did

10:17.695 --> 10:19.195
when we first arrived on this planet,

10:19.195 --> 10:22.930
and just like then, we
will survive and prosper.

10:23.932 --> 10:26.395
Do not lose faith.

10:27.235 --> 10:30.587
I made you a promise back
then, and it still holds.

10:31.506 --> 10:35.476
As long as I'm breathing, you will be safe.

10:38.079 --> 10:41.574
Well ah, we'll make our way to Key Diego.

10:41.929 --> 10:45.028
We'll buy a boat and anchor
up along the coastline.

10:45.028 --> 10:46.687
I hear it's rich with sea otter.

10:46.721 --> 10:48.088
A simple life.

10:48.123 --> 10:50.679
I find the notion very attractive.

10:52.589 --> 10:54.051
Yes.

10:57.361 --> 10:59.295
I married well.

11:12.347 --> 11:13.941
Be careful.

11:28.182 --> 11:30.850
I am very proud of all of you.

11:30.884 --> 11:36.122
It's been a brutal winter,
filled with blood and hardship,

11:36.156 --> 11:38.226
away from your families.

11:39.059 --> 11:43.261
Plunder has been scarce since Tucumcari.

11:44.565 --> 11:48.367
Even my head collection
is looking bedraggled.

11:48.402 --> 11:51.304
- [laughter]
- Isn't it?

11:51.338 --> 11:55.471
- [yells]
- [laughter]

11:55.976 --> 11:58.010
But a thaw is coming, my friends.

11:58.045 --> 11:59.946
The first kiss of spring.

11:59.980 --> 12:04.378
In a few days, we will ride into Defiance.

12:04.378 --> 12:07.287
We will fill our bellies, fill our pockets.

12:07.287 --> 12:10.944
- (man) Yeah!
- And savor the sweet sounds of over

12:10.944 --> 12:15.661
2,000 pink-meats crying out for mercy!

12:15.696 --> 12:16.896
(all) Yeah!

12:16.930 --> 12:21.681
We will deny them mercy,
the way they denied us

12:21.681 --> 12:24.504
when we first arrived here,

12:24.538 --> 12:28.363
looking for nothing more
than a home to call our own.

12:28.363 --> 12:29.640
(all) Yeah.

12:29.943 --> 12:32.425
Look around, friends.

12:33.580 --> 12:36.726
We are home!

12:36.726 --> 12:38.196
[cheering]

12:38.196 --> 12:40.119
(Geeze) General!

12:40.154 --> 12:43.256

29:34.968 --> 29:38.103
Everything you say sounds
perfectly reasonable.

29:38.138 --> 29:40.452
You were prisoners, forced to collude

29:40.452 --> 29:42.050
with the enemy to keep your son alive,

29:42.050 --> 29:45.573
a plausible story that,
taken on face value...

29:46.446 --> 29:47.809
I can understand.

29:47.809 --> 29:49.944
Hell, I can even sympathize with you.

29:49.944 --> 29:51.317
That's very decent of you.

29:51.351 --> 29:53.975
That does not, however, explain the fact

29:53.975 --> 29:56.198
that you committed acts
of terror and treason

29:56.199 --> 29:57.954
against the people of Defiance.

29:57.954 --> 29:59.646
It doesn't explain why you've been lying

29:59.646 --> 30:01.399
to me ever since you got back into town.

30:01.399 --> 30:05.362
Hell, I don't even know that
you're not lying to me right now.

30:06.466 --> 30:08.229
So you're gonna torture him?

30:09.302 --> 30:11.170
I'm gonna do whatever I need to do

30:11.204 --> 30:13.062
to get the job done.

30:13.504 --> 30:16.573
I have nothing useful to
tell you. Do your worst.

30:17.077 --> 30:18.554
I intend to.

30:18.712 --> 30:22.492
- Whoa, whoa!
- Get your hands off my son.

30:22.492 --> 30:25.054
Well, you seem awfully concerned
for him, when a moment ago,

30:25.054 --> 30:27.421
you were saying he was a
disgrace to the family name!

30:27.422 --> 30:28.995
<i>Shtak,</i> Nolan! You can't do this!

30:28.995 --> 30:30.559
I can do whatever I want!

30:30.559 --> 30:32.019
You're bluffing.

30:32.859 --> 30:34.660
- [gunshot]
- Ah!

30:34.781 --> 30:37.875
Now, your son said that Rahm Tak

30:37.875 --> 30:40.246
has a bunch of fancy,
new weapons and a plan

30:40.246 --> 30:41.466
to enter Defiance.

30:41.466 --> 30:43.911
- Tell me what that plan is!
- This is all your fault.

30:43.911 --> 30:46.118
I spied for the Collective
under extreme duress.

30:46.118 --> 30:48.961
I have no love or loyalty for
Rahm Tak. I know nothing about...

30:48.962 --> 30:50.509
- [gunshot]
- Lies!

30:50.543 --> 30:52.832
At the camp, Stahma and I
were forced to humor him.

30:52.832 --> 30:53.773
- Liar!
- [screams]

30:53.773 --> 30:56.477
We talked of the old days, mostly!
He told us nothing! Nothing!

30:56.477 --> 30:58.117
You don't want to tell me the plans?

30:58.151 --> 30:59.785
Say good-bye to your little boy.

30:59.819 --> 31:01.620
Believe me, please! Please!

31:01.655 --> 31:03.589
I don't know anything, I swear to you!

31:03.623 --> 31:06.659
Don't kill him! I swear to
you, I'm telling the truth!

31:06.693 --> 31:09.997
Don't kill him, please! Nolan!

31:10.597 --> 31:12.731
Nolan, he's my only child.

31:15.835 --> 31:17.325
What do you think?

31:18.004 --> 31:19.921
You believe him?

31:21.107 --> 31:23.667
Yeah. I believe him.

31:31.284 --> 31:34.286
[laughs]

31:44.464 --> 31:46.165
You were both bluffing!

31:46.199 --> 31:49.201
[laughs]

31:52.072 --> 31:53.986
Oh, well played.

31:56.242 --> 31:58.177
Well played.

32:06.753 --> 32:08.325
Andina?

32:15.862 --> 32:17.280
Andina?

32:19.366 --> 32:20.748
Andina?

32:21.534 --> 32:22.952
Luke?

32:24.437 --> 32:26.605
Luke's right here.

32:28.975 --> 32:31.069
- Where's Andina?
- At the market.

32:31.069 --> 32:32.381
She ran out of <i>makfyego.</i>

32:32.382 --> 32:34.806
- Hey.
- I said I'd watch Bear.

32:35.348 --> 32:38.875
- Bear?
- Bear is what Pilar called him.

32:39.886 --> 32:41.631
(Alak) When were you guys with Pilar?

32:41.631 --> 32:43.910
Nolan and I found her with the baby

32:43.910 --> 32:46.101
in the woods outside of the V.C. camp.

32:47.360 --> 32:50.368
So it was you guys who rescued him? Huh?

32:52.332 --> 32:53.865
What about Pilar?

32:54.267 --> 32:55.986
Nolan shot her.

32:58.171 --> 32:59.687
Good.

33:02.574 --> 33:05.274
On our way back to
Defiance, I noticed he liked

33:05.275 --> 33:07.288
to stare up at the sky.

33:08.508 --> 33:10.314
So I pointed out all the clouds shaped

33:10.314 --> 33:12.017
like different animals.

33:12.886 --> 33:15.446
He started crying after Andina left.

33:15.455 --> 33:19.215
- [baby whimpers]
- Oh... hey.

33:19.215 --> 33:21.293
Well, I brought him outside.

33:21.327 --> 33:24.769
I thought maybe a look up
at the sky might calm him.

33:25.165 --> 33:27.299
Oh... here.

33:31.229 --> 33:32.812
He has your eyes.

33:36.513 --> 33:37.946
[chuckles]

33:45.051 --> 33:47.106
Uh, thank you.

33:48.421 --> 33:50.155
I'm just doing my job.

33:50.190 --> 33:54.447
No, I mean, thanks for saving my son.

34:12.764 --> 34:14.835
I don't want to hurt you.

34:21.449 --> 34:23.141
What do you want?

34:25.018 --> 34:27.886
Together, we will drive to Bissel Pass.

34:28.389 --> 34:30.839
You will order the stasis nets lowered.

34:30.839 --> 34:34.275
We will travel somewhere
far away, somewhere safe.

34:34.275 --> 34:37.630
Once I am convinced
Nolan has not followed us,

34:37.665 --> 34:39.438
I will free you.

34:44.172 --> 34:46.303
That's a lawkeeper's gun.

34:46.708 --> 34:48.275
Whose blood is on it?

34:48.309 --> 34:50.418
One of the deputies.

34:52.313 --> 34:54.708
He tried to arrest me.

34:56.284 --> 34:57.510
[gunshot]

34:57.510 --> 35:00.420
[both grunting]

35:00.455 --> 35:02.689
You're a terrorist. You know that, right?

35:02.724 --> 35:05.997
I'm a mother who loved her son.

35:06.236 --> 35:08.013
Perhaps more than I should have.

35:08.013 --> 35:10.054
- [laughs]
- Don't laugh at me!

35:10.054 --> 35:12.249
Oh, hey, I'm just taking a moment to enjoy

35:12.249 --> 35:14.525
what a great mother you are, Stahma.

35:14.702 --> 35:18.305
You love Alak so much,
you had to kill his wife.

35:18.339 --> 35:19.773
Just like Kenya!

35:19.807 --> 35:22.776
You loved her so much, you had to kill her!

35:22.810 --> 35:25.404
Oh, you are so beautiful, Stahma.

35:25.404 --> 35:26.914
[yells]

35:30.118 --> 35:32.085
[screams]

35:32.120 --> 35:33.954
[glass shatters]

35:38.226 --> 35:39.905
You're not good.

35:41.062 --> 35:42.651
You're not loving.

35:43.331 --> 35:45.573
You're just a vicious, nasty thug.

35:45.573 --> 35:47.267
[yells]

35:51.005 --> 35:54.040
I think one of us is going to die.

35:57.245 --> 35:58.607
Ah!

36:17.657 --> 36:21.777
It would have been so easy
for me to blow up the Arch

36:22.036 --> 36:24.226
while you were still inside it.

36:24.806 --> 36:27.908
I chose not to kill you then.

36:27.942 --> 36:31.512
And I choose not to kill you now.

36:32.114 --> 36:34.215
[winces]

36:38.353 --> 36:41.831
I hope you go to your grave wondering why.

36:50.298 --> 36:52.041
Do you want something to eat ?

36:52.042 --> 36:57.639
No, thanks. I'm not hungry... but what
about a scotch for my friend here please

36:58.307 --> 36:59.507
Very well.

37:00.808 --> 37:04.101
- Drinks are on me.
- What are we celebrating?

37:04.609 --> 37:06.557
It's a thank-you.

37:07.148 --> 37:10.109
Why didn't you tell me it was
you and Irisa who rescued Luke?

37:10.109 --> 37:11.518
Didn't seem to matter that much.

37:11.552 --> 37:13.112
You rescued my son.

37:15.247 --> 37:16.910
Think it would be better for him if I was

37:16.910 --> 37:19.494
less like me and more like you.

37:20.361 --> 37:22.601
- I'm weak.
- Not true.

37:23.798 --> 37:26.844
You survived seven months
of captivity in the wild

37:26.844 --> 37:29.002
with a madwoman who kept your son alive.

37:29.037 --> 37:31.471
You escaped from Rahm Tak's camp,

37:31.506 --> 37:34.155
helped us ferret out a couple of spies.

37:34.676 --> 37:37.537
In my book, that makes
you one smart, capable,

37:37.538 --> 37:38.838
strong young man.

37:38.838 --> 37:40.927
- Doesn't make me a good father.
- Hmm.

37:41.883 --> 37:43.468
Well, if you're trying to hold me up

37:43.468 --> 37:46.817
as an example, you're gonna
be sorely disappointed.

37:48.056 --> 37:50.221
My version of parenting
was to take a perfectly

37:50.221 --> 37:53.694
good kid and try and turn
her into a stone-cold killer.

37:53.728 --> 37:55.870
Screwed her up royally in the process.

37:55.870 --> 37:58.432
Nah. Irisa's the best.

37:58.466 --> 38:00.418
She presents well.

38:00.902 --> 38:04.237
Actually, that's not true.
She doesn't present well.

38:04.272 --> 38:05.669
Not at all.

38:06.107 --> 38:09.218
- But you love her?
- I'd die for her.

38:09.777 --> 38:13.129
- She loves you back?
- I guess.

38:14.582 --> 38:16.346
Maybe that's enough.

38:17.285 --> 38:20.454
A couple of screw-ups like
you and me, we better hope so.

38:26.694 --> 38:28.128
I miss Christie.

38:34.836 --> 38:36.770
I know you do, son.

38:44.946 --> 38:46.580
Anything?

38:46.614 --> 38:48.515
Nobody's come in or out.

38:48.549 --> 38:50.731
They've been in there a long time.

38:51.219 --> 38:53.156
Should we go in and check on them?

38:56.891 --> 38:58.210
We wait.

39:03.350 --> 39:06.398
_

39:09.373 --> 39:11.779
_

39:15.826 --> 39:19.994
_

39:25.353 --> 39:33.037
[sobs]

39:38.187 --> 39:45.806
_

39:48.734 --> 39:53.234
_

40:18.773 --> 40:20.106
General?

40:20.141 --> 40:22.662
She was an assassin sent by the humans

40:22.662 --> 40:24.334
under the guise of peace.

40:24.334 --> 40:26.083
They're getting smarter.

40:26.781 --> 40:29.001
Then I guess it's high
time we teach them a lesson,

40:29.001 --> 40:30.450
wouldn't you say?

40:30.485 --> 40:34.675
Bebe, put on some coffee.
It's time to burn the city!

40:34.675 --> 40:37.190
[cheering]

40:53.798 --> 40:56.072
You know you had this coming.

40:58.269 --> 41:00.223
You bombed the Arch.

41:00.638 --> 41:02.575
You killed people.

41:03.508 --> 41:05.072
Let me ask you.

41:05.377 --> 41:06.993
How many lives would you be willing

41:06.993 --> 41:09.092
to sacrifice for your daughter?

41:09.381 --> 41:11.508
How many lives have you already sacrificed?

41:11.508 --> 41:14.618
Oh, leave me out of this.
I'm nothing like you.

41:15.954 --> 41:17.738
You're right about that.

41:20.191 --> 41:24.595
Were you there when they
did in Rafe McCawley?

41:24.629 --> 41:26.536
The man died on his feet,

41:27.430 --> 41:29.649
trying to save Christie.

41:31.136 --> 41:35.336
He took down three V.C. soldiers
and wounded Rahm Tak himself.

41:35.807 --> 41:37.757
- Stupid.
- Hm-mmm.

41:39.544 --> 41:41.211
And noble.

41:41.246 --> 41:44.511
Sounds like Rafe. Good man.

41:45.483 --> 41:47.751
His heroism shames us all.

41:53.158 --> 41:56.585
Amanda's gonna hang me
for treason, isn't she?

41:56.963 --> 41:59.016
Not fair to put it all on her shoulders,

41:59.016 --> 42:03.143
but, yeah, she's gonna hang you.

42:11.543 --> 42:13.748
Could I have a dash more salt?

42:18.316 --> 42:21.318
[Stahma gasps]

42:25.757 --> 42:28.196
- Aah!
- Stahma.

42:30.829 --> 42:33.042
I need your help.
