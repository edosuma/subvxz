00:37.800 --> 00:39.600
JUST GET BACK, PLEASE!

00:41.100 --> 00:43.000
WHOA, TAO, THANK GOD.

00:43.200 --> 00:45.700
WOULD YOU PLEASE
TELL THESE PEOPLE

00:45.700 --> 00:48.800
TO CALM DOWN
AND STEP BACK?

00:50.500 --> 00:53.900
CALM DOWN AND STEP BACK!

00:57.100 --> 00:59.600
YOU DON'T SPEAK CHINESE?

00:59.600 --> 01:03.600
NO, I DON'T.
I'M FOURTH-GENICAN.

01:04.099 --> 01:07.800
WELL, YOU ALWAYS SOUND FLUENT
WHEN WE ORDER TAKEOUT!

01:15.400 --> 01:19.000
Clay: WHY OWN A 4x4 IF YOU CAN'T
PERFORM SIDEHILL MANEUVERS

01:19.000 --> 01:20.700
WITHOUT IT STALLING OUT?

01:20.700 --> 01:24.500
NOW, IF YOUR TRUCK HAS A
SQUARE-FLANGED INTAKE MANIFOLD,

01:24.500 --> 01:29.300
YOU'D BE CRAZY NOT TO INSTALL
AN OFF-ROAD CARBURETOR.

01:29.300 --> 01:30.900
Brenda:
MAMA, YOU REALIZE

01:30.900 --> 01:33.800
RESTAURANTS IN LOS ANGELES
SERVE LUNCH, TOO.

01:33.800 --> 01:36.800
AND CHARGE $15
FOR A SANDWICH.

01:36.800 --> 01:38.900
NO.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

01:44.000 --> 01:46.200
HAVE YOU THOUGHT
ABOUT WHEN YOU AND FRITZ

01:46.200 --> 01:47.200
WILL HAVE THE WEDDING?

01:47.200 --> 01:48.500
OH, FOR HEAVEN SAKES,
MOTHER,

01:48.500 --> 01:52.500
WE HAVEN'T EVEN DECIDED
IF WE <i>WANT</i> A CEREMONY -- AT ALL.

01:55.200 --> 01:59.200
NOW, HONEY, DON'T TAKE THIS
THE WRONG WAY,

01:59.600 --> 02:02.500
BUT IF YOU'RE EVEN THINKING
ABOUT STARTING A FAMILY,

02:02.800 --> 02:04.600
TICKTOCK GOES THE CLOCK.

02:04.600 --> 02:07.100
COME ON, WILLIE RAE.

02:07.100 --> 02:09.100
ONE THING AT A TIME.

02:09.100 --> 02:10.800
I MEAN, THEY'VE GOT TO FIND
A HOUSE FIRST.

02:10.800 --> 02:13.200
THIS PLACE IS NOT BIG ENOUGH
FOR A KID.

02:13.200 --> 02:14.700
WELL, ABOUT THAT...

02:16.800 --> 02:19.900
BRENDA, DON'T TELL ME THAT
YOU TWO ARE GETTING MARRIED

02:19.900 --> 02:21.000
BECAUSE YOU'RE PREGNANT?

02:21.000 --> 02:22.000
NO, MAMA!

02:22.000 --> 02:23.000
WHAT I'M TRYING TO TELL YOU

02:23.000 --> 02:26.100
IS THAT I'M GOING THROUGH
EARLY ONSET MENOPAUSE, OKAY?!

02:26.100 --> 02:30.100
ISN'T THAT JUST --
JUST LOADS BETTER?

02:30.400 --> 02:33.000
MORE COFFEE, ANYONE?

02:38.700 --> 02:39.600
HELLO?

02:40.200 --> 02:41.800
OH, YES, COMMANDER.

02:41.800 --> 02:42.600
OH, NO, NO, NO.

02:42.600 --> 02:46.300
UM, I'M BACK ON ACTIVE DUTY
AS OF YESTERDAY.

02:51.700 --> 02:54.500
THE VICTIM WAS A 33-YEAR-OLD
CHINESE NATIONAL

02:54.500 --> 02:56.200
WITH PERMANENT-RESIDENCE
STATUS.

02:56.200 --> 02:58.700
HER NAME
WAS PING-MEI ZHANG.

02:58.700 --> 03:01.700
SHE OWNED AND OPERATED
EIGHT STARS TOURS,

03:01.700 --> 03:04.800
WHICH, AS YOU CAN SEE,
WAS PRETTY SUCCESSFUL.

03:06.000 --> 03:08.600
SO, PING-MEI --
PING-MEI...

03:08.600 --> 03:10.600
Tao: HER HUSBAND
AND FATHER-IN-LAW ARE WAITING

03:10.600 --> 03:12.400
FOR WHEN YOU
FINISH UP HERE.

03:13.200 --> 03:14.700
LIEUTENANT.
CHIEF.

03:18.500 --> 03:20.500
AND THIS IS A PRIORITY
BECAUSE...?

03:20.500 --> 03:22.100
EIGHT STARS
WAS SHUTTLING AROUND

03:22.100 --> 03:24.400
SEVERAL HIGH-RANKING
COMMUNIST PARTY OFFICIALS

03:24.400 --> 03:26.200
FROM THE MAINLAND.

03:30.800 --> 03:33.600
Tao: PRELIMINARY EXAM
SHOWS THE VICTIM WAS STRUCK

03:33.600 --> 03:34.500
ON THE FRONT OF THE SKULL

03:34.500 --> 03:36.400
WITH AN UNIDENTIFIED
BLUNT OBJECT.

03:36.400 --> 03:37.500
GIVEN HOW SHE FELL,

03:37.500 --> 03:39.900
LOOKS LIKE SHE WAS ON HER KNEES
WHEN SHE GOT HIT.

03:39.900 --> 03:41.700
MAYBE SHE WAS ASKING
FOR MERCY.

03:43.900 --> 03:45.800
OR SHE WAS LOOKING FOR THIS.

03:48.900 --> 03:51.100
LET'S FIND OUT WHAT'S
ON THIS CAMERA, PLEASE.

03:56.200 --> 03:57.600
WHO CALLED THIS IN?

03:57.600 --> 03:59.300
AROUND 5:00 A.M.
THIS MORNING,

03:59.300 --> 04:01.400
PING-MEI'S HUSBAND
AND HER FATHER-IN-LAW --

04:01.400 --> 04:03.500
BOTH, UH,
CHINESE NATIONALS --

04:03.500 --> 04:06.700
THEY ARRIVED TO OPEN UP
THE OFFICE, SERVICE THE BUSES.

04:06.700 --> 04:09.900
HUSBAND DISCOVERS WIFE'S BODY.
HE CALLS 911.

04:11.000 --> 04:17.074
Advertise your product or brand here

04:21.600 --> 04:24.000
MR. SANCHEZ, HOW ARE
THEIR LANGUAGE SKILLS?

04:24.000 --> 04:25.500
THE SON HAS BASIC ENGLISH.

04:25.500 --> 04:27.300
THE FATHER
ONLY SPEAKS CHINESE,

04:27.700 --> 04:28.200
BUT, UNFORTUNATELY, CHIEF,

04:28.200 --> 04:31.500
OUR TRANSLATOR'S IN MONTEREY
PARK UNTIL THIS AFTERNOON.

04:31.500 --> 04:32.400
OKAY.

04:33.800 --> 04:35.300
MR. CHEN, UM...

04:35.800 --> 04:38.200
I'M DEPUTY CHIEF BRENDA LEIGH
JOHNSON OF THE L.A.P.D.

04:38.200 --> 04:40.500
WE ARE SO SORRY
FOR YOUR LOSS.

04:40.900 --> 04:42.200
DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

04:42.200 --> 04:43.200
YES.

04:44.100 --> 04:48.100
YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHO MIGHT HAVE
WANTED TO HURT YOUR WIFE?

04:48.300 --> 04:52.600
YES, LAST NIGHT WHEN I LEAVE,
I SEE MAN DOWN THIS STREET.

04:53.100 --> 04:54.200
HE WATCH.

04:55.100 --> 04:57.400
WHEN HE SEE ME,
HE WALK AWAY FAST.

04:59.300 --> 05:01.700
I THINK MAYBE THIS MAN
KILL MY WIFE.

05:01.700 --> 05:04.000
DO YOU REMEMBER
WHAT HE LOOKED LIKE?

05:04.000 --> 05:07.600
BLOND, UH, TALL,
NOT YOUNG, NOT OLD.

05:10.800 --> 05:11.700
I'M SORRY,
IS THERE SOMETHING

05:11.700 --> 05:13.900
YOUR FATHER THINKS
WE SHOULD KNOW?

05:13.900 --> 05:15.700
MY WIFE IS DEAD.

05:15.700 --> 05:19.700
MY FATHER FEARS
THAT WE WILL BE KILLED, TOO.

05:20.500 --> 05:21.400
HE IS OLD AND FOOLISH

05:21.400 --> 05:24.000
AND FORGETS THAT WE LIVE
IN A NEW COUNTRY.

05:32.000 --> 05:34.800
MR. CHEN, UM, I KNOW
THIS IS VERY UPSETTING,

05:34.800 --> 05:37.900
BUT OUR -- OUR OFFICE
IS JUST AROUND THE CORNER,

05:37.900 --> 05:39.300
AND WE'RE GONNA START WORK
RIGHT NOW

05:39.300 --> 05:40.900
TRYING TO FIND
YOUR WIFE'S MURDERER,

05:40.900 --> 05:43.700
AND IF YOU COULD COME WITH US,
IT WOULD BE A BIG HELP.

05:43.900 --> 05:45.500
YEAH.

05:45.500 --> 05:46.600
THANK YOU.

05:46.900 --> 05:47.800
DETECTIVE.

05:53.600 --> 05:55.100
LIEUTENANT,
WHAT'S WRONG?

05:55.300 --> 05:56.800
EVEN AMONG
ASSIMILATED CHINESE,

05:56.800 --> 05:59.500
THE RULE IS
"HONOR YOUR PARENTS."

05:59.500 --> 06:01.000
NO CHILD TAKES THAT TONE
WITH THEIR FATHER

06:01.000 --> 06:02.600
EVEN IN THIS SITUATION.

06:02.600 --> 06:03.900
WELL, FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH,

06:03.900 --> 06:05.700
WE HAVE A SIMILAR TRADITION
WHERE I COME FROM,

06:05.700 --> 06:06.400
AND I CAN TELL YOU,

06:06.400 --> 06:09.100
IT'S A LOT EASIER TO PREACH
THAN TO PRACTICE.

06:15.400 --> 06:18.300
PING-MEI SAY,
"THIS IS SKYBAR."

06:18.300 --> 06:21.100
OWNER IS CINDY CRAWFORD.

06:23.700 --> 06:27.400
PING-MEI SAY,
"THIS IS MEL'S DINER

06:27.400 --> 06:29.000
"ON SUNSET BOULEVARD.

06:30.000 --> 06:32.700
TELEVISION SHOW 'HAPPY DAYS'
FILMED HERE."

06:38.800 --> 06:40.600
PING-MEI ASK,
"WHERE PEOPLE LIVE?"

06:41.800 --> 06:45.000
SHE ASK,
"WHO FROM FUJIAN PROVINCE?"

06:45.500 --> 06:47.000
WHO FROM XIAMEN?

06:49.600 --> 06:52.200
PING-MEI SAY
SHE FROM PUDONG, SHANGHAI.

06:57.300 --> 07:01.300
BUT HER HEART...ME...

07:01.300 --> 07:03.100
CHEN REN-DI...

07:04.300 --> 07:06.400
IS FROM XIAMEN.

07:13.000 --> 07:17.300
PING-MEI SAY THAT I, REN-DI,
AM HER LIFE.

07:17.300 --> 07:19.500
SHE SAY I AM ALL THINGS
TO HER.

07:28.800 --> 07:31.300
SORRY TO INTERRUPT YOU.
INTERVIEW ONE IS OPEN.

07:31.300 --> 07:32.800
THANK YOU, DETECTIVE.

07:33.200 --> 07:36.100
UH, MR. CHEN, I KNOW
THAT YOU'VE BEEN THROUGH A LOT,

07:36.100 --> 07:38.400
BUT TIME'S VERY IMPORTANT
TO US

07:38.400 --> 07:40.100
WHEN WE'RE INVESTIGATING
A MURDER,

07:40.100 --> 07:42.100
SO IF YOU COULD STAY
JUST A SHORT WHILE LONGER

07:42.100 --> 07:45.100
AND HELP US TO TRANSLATE SOME
OF YOUR WIFE'S PHONE MESSAGES,

07:45.100 --> 07:47.700
THAT WOULD BE VERY USEFUL.

07:47.700 --> 07:49.600
CAN YOU DO THAT?

07:50.700 --> 07:52.200
MR. CHEN.

07:55.600 --> 07:56.800
THANK YOU.

07:57.900 --> 08:00.200
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

08:02.100 --> 08:03.100
Provenza:
COME ON, CHIEF.

08:03.100 --> 08:05.300
THIS GUY AND HIS DEAD WIFE
HAVE NO CREDIBILITY.

08:05.300 --> 08:07.600
EVERYBODY HERE KNOWS
THAT UP UNTIL 10 YEARS AGO,

08:07.600 --> 08:11.000
MEL'S DINER ON SUNSET
WAS A BEN FRANKS RESTAURANT.

08:11.000 --> 08:12.800
SO SHE FUDGED THE FACTS
A LITTLE.

08:12.800 --> 08:13.700
YEAH, WELL,
THAT'S SOMETHING

08:13.700 --> 08:15.900
YOU AND GABRIEL WOULD KNOW
ALL ABOUT, HUH?

08:15.900 --> 08:18.200
KNOCK IT OFF!
LIEUTENANT...

08:18.200 --> 08:20.400
I DON'T WANT TO HEAR ANYTHING
ELSE ABOUT THIS DATING THING,

08:20.400 --> 08:21.900
FROM ANYONE, OKAY?

08:27.800 --> 08:29.400
YES, SERGEANT.

08:29.400 --> 08:31.400
LARRY LIN,
OUR MANDARIN TRANSLATOR --

08:31.400 --> 08:32.799
HE'S ABOUT
FIVE MINUTES AWAY.

08:32.799 --> 08:34.000
DO YOU WANT
TO WAIT FOR HIM

08:34.000 --> 08:36.700
OR JUST SEND HIM INTO INTERVIEW
ONE WHEN HE GETS HERE?

08:36.700 --> 08:40.200
NO, UM, SERGEANT.
NEITHER.

08:40.400 --> 08:42.600
I'D LIKE HIM TO WAIT HERE

08:42.600 --> 08:45.500
AND CONFIRM MR. CHEN'S
TRANSLATIONS.

08:45.500 --> 08:46.700
THANK YOU.

09:03.200 --> 09:05.500
OKAY, LET'S FINISH HERE,
ALL RIGHT?

09:07.400 --> 09:11.400
Woman: First saved message --
7:19 P.M.

09:23.200 --> 09:26.100
THIS IS PING-MEI
FRIEND AN-LI.

09:26.100 --> 09:28.000
AN-LI BUY NEW SHOES.

09:28.000 --> 09:30.600
SHE THINK PING-MEI LIKE
THESE SHOES VERY MUCH.

09:32.400 --> 09:36.400
Woman: Next saved message --
9:19 P.M.

09:48.800 --> 09:50.800
THIS MAN SAY
HIS NAME CHU YI.

09:51.300 --> 09:54.600
HE THINK HE LEFT VIDEO CAMERA
ON BUS.

09:54.600 --> 09:56.100
 <i>HE WANTS PING-MEI CALL HIM.</i>

09:57.400 --> 09:58.600
OKAY.

10:00.300 --> 10:04.200
Woman: Next saved message --
9:33 P.M.

10:04.200 --> 10:06.200
Man: Hey, hon.
It's your wu ming.

10:06.400 --> 10:08.200
I'm sorry, baby.
I'm just leaving Long Beach.

10:08.200 --> 10:09.600
Do me a favor, huh?

10:09.700 --> 10:12.100
Since I'm running late,
I'll pick you up at work.

10:12.100 --> 10:13.700
Stay awake for me, huh?

10:23.000 --> 10:24.600
MR. CHEN...

10:25.700 --> 10:28.700
IF YOU COULD HELP ME UNDERSTAND
THIS MESSAGE.

10:29.500 --> 10:33.400
 <i>THIS WU MING --</i>
 <i>DO YOU KNOW WHO THIS IS?</i>

10:35.800 --> 10:39.800
IT APPEARS THAT WU MING
KNEW YOUR WIFE.

10:39.900 --> 10:41.800
MR. CHEN, DID YOUR WIFE
NOT GO HOME LAST NIGHT?

10:41.800 --> 10:43.500
IS THAT WHAT HAPPENED?

10:43.600 --> 10:47.600
APPARENTLY, YOUR WIFE
WAS HAVING A RELATIONSHIP WITH ANOTHER MAN.

10:49.500 --> 10:51.400
DID YOU KNOW ABOUT THIS?

10:53.700 --> 10:55.500
I WANT A LAWYER.

11:00.000 --> 11:02.800
????  

11:02.800 --> 11:04.800
RECEIVES RESIDENT STATUS.

11:04.800 --> 11:05.800
THREE MONTHS LATER,

11:05.800 --> 11:09.500
PING-MEI ZHANG FILES PAPERS
FOR EIGHT STARS TOURS,

11:09.500 --> 11:10.800
LISTING HERSELF
AS THE SOLE OWNER.

11:10.800 --> 11:13.400
EVEN THOUGH SHE'D BEEN MARRIED
TWO YEARS BY THAT TIME?

11:13.400 --> 11:14.900
SHE HAD THE BUSINESS
IN HER NAME ALONE,

11:14.900 --> 11:16.200
AND WE DON'T KNOW WHY.

11:16.200 --> 11:17.800
IS THERE ANY CHANCE
THAT SHE WAS BEING EXTORTED

11:17.800 --> 11:20.300
BY ONE OF THE LOCAL GANGS,
LIKE THE MAH CHING OR --

11:20.300 --> 11:23.400
"MAH CHING GANG."
JEEZ LOUISE, FOLKS.

11:23.400 --> 11:24.800
HOW SIMPLE CAN THIS BE?

11:24.900 --> 11:27.900
HUSBAND DISCOVERS HIS WIFE
IS SLEEPING AROUND.

11:27.900 --> 11:30.600
WHEN WIFE'S ON HER DAINTY LITTLE
KNEES BEGGING FORGIVENESS,

11:30.600 --> 11:33.200
HUSBAND -- POP! --
POPS HER ON THE HEAD.

11:33.200 --> 11:36.500
DON'T TELL ME THAT A CHINESE MAN
IS GONNA FEEL ANY DIFFERENT

11:36.500 --> 11:38.600
ABOUT A CHEATING WIFE
THAN ANY OTHER MAN.

11:38.600 --> 11:39.800
MAYBE MORE SO.

11:39.800 --> 11:41.300
IN MOST ASIAN CULTURES,

11:41.300 --> 11:43.800
ADULTERY PROVES A HUSBAND'S
WEAK CHARACTER,

11:44.000 --> 11:47.100
AND THE SHAME REMAINS ON HIM
EVEN AFTER THE DIVORCE.

11:47.100 --> 11:48.500
NOW, IF REN-DI CHEN
IS SUFFERING

11:48.500 --> 11:49.900
THE SIDE EFFECTS
OF CULTURE SHOCK --

11:49.900 --> 11:52.700
TAO, IS CULTURE SHOCK
LIKE A MENTAL ILLNESS?

11:52.700 --> 11:53.900
IN THE EXTREME.

11:53.900 --> 11:55.900
IT'S A PHENOMENON
AMONG IMMIGRANTS

11:55.900 --> 11:58.200
OR PEOPLE WHO FIND THEMSELVES
IN A PLACE OTHER THAN THEIR HOME

11:58.200 --> 12:00.900
OR IF THEIR ENVIRONMENT CHANGES
SUBSTANTIALLY.

12:00.900 --> 12:04.200
OH, YOU MEAN LIKE, FOR EXAMPLE,
UH, IN THE WORKPLACE.

12:04.200 --> 12:06.500
YOU SUDDENLY FIND OUT
THE PEOPLE AROUND YOU

12:06.500 --> 12:08.300
ARE CARRYING ON
A RELATIONSHIP.

12:08.300 --> 12:09.400
YOU MEAN LIKE THAT.

12:09.700 --> 12:12.600
AND CULTURE SHOCK CAUSES
IRRATIONAL BEHAVIOR.

12:12.600 --> 12:14.700
ANYONE FEELING IRRATIONAL?
SIR?

12:14.700 --> 12:16.900
WHAT HAVE WE LEARNED
ABOUT THIS WU MING FELLA?

12:16.900 --> 12:20.000
Irene:
TURNS OUT OUR VICTIM'S BOYFRIEND
WAS MAKING A LITTLE JOKE.

12:20.000 --> 12:23.100
"WU MING" IN CHINESE
MEANS "MYSTERY MAN."

12:23.100 --> 12:25.800
AND IF ANY OF THE EMPLOYEES
KNOW WHO "WU MING" IS,

12:25.800 --> 12:26.900
THEY'RE NOT STEPPING FORWARD.

12:26.900 --> 12:29.700
UNSURPRISING CONSIDERING

22:52.800 --> 22:54.800
WHO WANT TO COME OVER HERE
FROM MAINLAND CHINA.

22:55.100 --> 22:55.900
WHEN THEY GET HERE,

22:55.900 --> 22:59.300
THEY HAVE TO PAY THE MEN
WHO ARRANGED THEIR PASSAGE --

22:59.300 --> 23:02.100
SNAKEHEADS, THEY'RE CALLED --
NOT VERY NICE GUYS.

23:02.100 --> 23:06.100
NOW, I HELPED FREE PING-MEI
OF THAT.

23:06.400 --> 23:07.900
IS THAT A CRIME?

23:09.900 --> 23:11.800
SHOULD I CALL MY ATTORNEY?

23:12.300 --> 23:14.300
SO YOU CARE ABOUT PING-MEI.

23:14.300 --> 23:16.200
WELL, YES, I DO.
VERY MUCH.

23:16.200 --> 23:18.400
ARE YOU A PHILANTHROPIST,
MR. CONROY?

23:19.500 --> 23:22.000
I'M AN ENTREPRENEUR...
DETECTIVE.

23:22.000 --> 23:25.100
MIGHT YOU KNOW HOW A YOUNG LADY
FROM SHANGHAI,

23:25.100 --> 23:27.200
WHO ARRIVED IN THIS COUNTRY
PENNILESS,

23:27.200 --> 23:28.400
MANAGED TO FIND ENOUGH MONEY

23:28.400 --> 23:30.700
TO START A COMPANY
AS LARGE AS EIGHT STARS?

23:30.700 --> 23:31.800
I LOANED HER THE CAPITAL

23:31.800 --> 23:34.800
FOR A SMALL PERCENTAGE
OF THE BUSINESS.

23:34.800 --> 23:35.900
IT'S LEGAL.

23:35.900 --> 23:39.100
IT'S A LEGAL PARTNERSHIP
OPPORTUNITY.

23:39.100 --> 23:41.800
DOES PING-MEI'S HUSBAND KNOW
YOUR PURSUIT OF THIS OPPORTUNITY

23:41.800 --> 23:43.600
INCLUDES SLEEPING
WITH HIS WIFE?

23:45.500 --> 23:47.600
REN-DI IS MORE
THAN SATISFIED

23:47.600 --> 23:50.500
WITH THE LIFE I'VE MADE POSSIBLE
FOR BOTH OF THEM,

23:50.600 --> 23:55.200
INCLUDING ARRANGING VISAS
FOR HIS FAMILY.

23:55.200 --> 23:56.300
I HAVE A SOURCE THAT TELLS ME

23:56.300 --> 23:59.200
THAT PING-MEI WANTED
TO STOP SEEING YOU.

23:59.800 --> 24:02.200
DID SHE INFORM YOU
OF THAT LAST NIGHT?

24:02.200 --> 24:04.600
YOUR SOURCE IS MISINFORMED.

24:04.600 --> 24:09.400
WHENEVER PING-MEI WANTS
TO RENEGOTIATE...TERMS,

24:09.400 --> 24:11.600
SHE THREATENS
TO WITHHOLD SEX,

24:11.600 --> 24:13.800
WHICH, IN THAT SENSE,

24:13.800 --> 24:17.800
MAKES OUR RELATIONSHIP NOT
UNLIKE A TRADITIONAL MARRIAGE.

24:18.100 --> 24:22.600
NOW, THAT'S THE END
OF MY SATISFYING YOUR...

24:22.600 --> 24:25.300
UNINFORMED,
PURITANICAL CURIOSITY.

24:25.300 --> 24:27.100
I'M NOT GONNA ANSWER
ANY MORE QUESTIONS...

24:28.000 --> 24:34.300
UNTIL YOU TELL ME EXACTLY --
EXACTLY -- WHY YOU ARE <i>HERE.</i>

24:35.200 --> 24:37.100
I'M SORRY TO INFORM YOU,
MR. CONROY,

24:37.100 --> 24:38.100
THAT THIS MORNING,

24:38.100 --> 24:39.600
PING-MEI ZHANG
WAS FOUND MURDERED

24:39.600 --> 24:41.800
ON THE UPPER DECK
OF ONE OF HER TOUR BUSES.

24:42.100 --> 24:44.000
AND WE BELIEVE YOU MAY BE
THE LAST PERSON

24:44.000 --> 24:45.600
TO SEE HER ALIVE.

24:47.300 --> 24:50.400
PING-MEI IS DEAD.

24:50.400 --> 24:51.500
BUT...

24:52.200 --> 24:55.500
WHEN I DROPPED HER OFF
THIS MORNING, SHE WAS...FINE.

24:57.500 --> 24:59.800
WHO ELSE
ARE YOU TALKING TO?

25:00.000 --> 25:04.000
WHERE IS HER HUSBAND
IN -- IN ALL OF THIS?

25:04.900 --> 25:06.400
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU HAVE PLANNED

25:06.400 --> 25:08.700
FOR THE NEXT 48 HOURS,
MR. CONROY,

25:08.700 --> 25:11.700
BUT LEAVING LOS ANGELES WOULD BE
A VERY BAD IDEA RIGHT NOW.

25:11.700 --> 25:14.600
YOU KNOW, I ALWAYS GET
IN TROUBLE

25:14.600 --> 25:17.600
WHEN I TRY TO DO SOMETHING NICE
FOR PEOPLE.

25:18.300 --> 25:19.400
LUCKY FOR YOU, THEN,

25:19.400 --> 25:21.800
I'M GUESSING THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN
TOO OFTEN.

25:29.000 --> 25:35.200
ONE GUY SAYS, "HOW CAN YOU SELL
A TALKING DOG FOR ONLY $20?"

25:35.200 --> 25:37.600
[ Chuckling ]
AND THE OTHER GUY SAYS,

25:37.600 --> 25:39.900
"YOU KNOW THE STORIES THAT DOG
WAS TELLING YOU?

25:39.900 --> 25:42.300
THEY WERE ALL A LOAD
OF [BLEEP]"

25:43.800 --> 25:45.000
BRENDA.

25:45.100 --> 25:46.500
HOW NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN.

25:46.500 --> 25:47.900
I'M SO SORRY TO KEEP
Y'ALL WAITING.

25:47.900 --> 25:49.200
I'M FEELING MUCH BETTER NOW.

25:49.200 --> 25:51.400
WELL, THAT'S ALL
THAT MATTERS.

25:51.400 --> 25:53.800
WE'LL GRAB THE CAR
AND GET YOU HOME NOW.

25:53.800 --> 25:55.500
SERGEANT, IF YOU COULD
KEEP WATCH HERE,

25:55.500 --> 25:58.100
AND IF MR. CONROY SO MUCH
AS BUYS A STICK OF GUM,

25:58.100 --> 25:59.200
I WANT TO KNOW ABOUT IT.

25:59.200 --> 26:01.000
OKAY? THANK YOU.

26:02.000 --> 26:02.900
OH!

26:03.300 --> 26:04.500
OH, I'M SO SORRY.

26:04.500 --> 26:07.200
I-I JUST REALIZED I NEED
TO MAKE ONE MORE STOP

26:07.200 --> 26:08.400
AT WORK BEFORE WE HEAD HOME.

26:08.400 --> 26:10.200
IT'LL JUST TAKE ONE MINUTE.
I PROMISE.

26:10.200 --> 26:12.700
GOOD HEAVENS,
I THOUGHT YOU WERE SICK.

26:12.700 --> 26:15.100
I AM, MAMA, WHICH IS WHY I'M
GOING TO THE DOCTOR TOMORROW.

26:15.100 --> 26:18.500
EXACTLY HOW SICK ARE YOU
IF YOU'RE GOING BACK TO WORK?

26:18.500 --> 26:20.300
GOODNESS, MAMA,
YOU KNOW AS WELL AS I DO

26:20.300 --> 26:22.100
THAT IF I ONLY WENT TO WORK
WHEN I FELT LIKE IT,

26:22.100 --> 26:23.600
NOTHING WOULD GET DONE!

26:25.100 --> 26:27.800
I THINK I WOULD LIKE
A PROFESSIONAL OPINION

26:27.800 --> 26:29.400
ABOUT ALL THIS.

26:32.100 --> 26:33.200
COME ON!

26:37.000 --> 26:38.000
OKAY, LOOKING AT EVERYTHING

26:38.000 --> 26:40.600
WE CARTED OUT OF
EIGHT STARS TOURS,

26:40.600 --> 26:43.200
WE GOT A 2 GIG
USB FLASH DRIVE,

26:43.300 --> 26:44.600
DISCOUNT COUPONS...

26:44.600 --> 26:48.400
CLEANING SUPPLIES,
MECHANICS TOOLS, GAS RECEIPTS.

26:48.400 --> 26:51.500
AND ANOTHER $100,000 IN CASH

26:51.500 --> 26:53.200
MASQUERADING AS TICKET SALES

26:53.200 --> 26:55.400
TUCKED INTO THE BACK
OF AN INDUSTRIAL SAFE.

26:56.300 --> 26:58.200
WHERE'S THE SEVENTH WRENCH?

26:58.400 --> 26:59.300
EXCUSE ME, DADDY?

27:00.000 --> 27:05.100
WELL, THE NORWICH TOOL KIT
HAS SEVEN REVERSIBLE WRENCHES.

27:05.100 --> 27:07.300
THIS IS ONLY
SIX PIECES HERE.

27:07.300 --> 27:09.700
LOOKS LIKE
THERE'S NO 2-INCHER.

27:09.700 --> 27:12.700
YEP. NO 2-INCHER.

27:13.400 --> 27:15.900
THAT ONLY PROVES THAT
SOMEONE COULDN'T KEEP
TRACK OF THEIR TOOLS.

27:15.900 --> 27:18.200
MAYBE, BUT LET'S GET A DUPLICATE
OF THAT 2-INCHER

27:18.200 --> 27:20.100
AND SEE IF IT'S CONSISTENT
WITH THE SKULL FRACTURE.

27:20.100 --> 27:23.200
CHIEF, I JUST GOT AN ALERT
FROM MasterCard.

27:23.200 --> 27:24.100
15 MINUTES AGO,

27:24.100 --> 27:26.800
OUR VICTIM'S HUSBAND PURCHASED
A ONE-WAY TICKET

27:26.800 --> 27:28.800
ON TRANS CHINA AIR.

27:29.100 --> 27:30.300
THANK YOU, DETECTIVE DANIELS.

27:30.300 --> 27:32.800
PLEASE CALL CUSTOMS AND GET ALL
THE RELEVANT FLIGHT INFORMATION.

27:33.400 --> 27:34.500
CHIEF JOHNSON, IS IT TRUE

27:34.500 --> 27:36.100
THAT YOU HAVE A CAMCORDER
IN EVIDENCE

27:36.100 --> 27:37.600
BELONGING TO YI CHU,

27:37.600 --> 27:39.800
DEPUTY UNDERSECRETARY
OF AGRICULTURAL AFFAIRS

27:39.800 --> 27:41.600
FOR THE PEOPLES REPUBLIC
OF CHINA?

27:41.600 --> 27:43.400
WELL, I KNEW IT BELONGED
TO <i>A</i> YI CHU.

27:43.400 --> 27:45.600
I DIDN'T KNOW IT BELONGED
TO <i>THE</i> YI CHU.

27:46.200 --> 27:48.100
MR. CHU SAYS HE CALLED
REPEATEDLY

27:48.100 --> 27:50.600
AND TOLD YOU THAT HE BORROWED
THE CAMERA FROM HIS BOSS,

27:50.600 --> 27:52.400
AND HE'S AFRAID TO RETURN
TO CHINA WITHOUT IT.

27:52.800 --> 27:55.000
IS HE ASKING FOR ASYLUM?

27:55.100 --> 27:57.600
THIS MAY SURPRISE YOU,
BUT IN SOME CULTURES,

27:57.600 --> 28:00.300
SUPERVISORS ARE STILL SHOWN
A MODICUM OF RESPECT,

28:00.300 --> 28:04.300
AND EMPLOYEES ACTUALLY
TRY TO PLEASE THE BOSS.

28:04.500 --> 28:05.600
SO LOSE THE ATTITUDE,

28:05.600 --> 28:07.300
SEE THIS GUY GETS
HIS DAMN CAMERA BACK.

28:07.300 --> 28:09.900
I DON'T NEED ANY MORE GRIEF
FROM THE CHINESE CONSUL,

28:09.900 --> 28:12.100
AND I DEFINITELY
DON'T NEED IT FROM YOU.

28:12.100 --> 28:13.500
PLEASE TELL ME I DID NOT
JUST SAY ALL THAT

28:13.500 --> 28:14.900
IN FRONT OF YOUR PARENTS.

28:15.300 --> 28:16.700
CHIEF POPE,
I'D LIKE TO INTRODUCE YOU

28:16.700 --> 28:19.800
TO MY MOM AND DAD --
WILLIE RAE AND CLAY JOHNSON.

28:22.700 --> 28:24.100
YES, IT'S A [CLEARS THROAT]
GREAT PLEASURE

28:24.100 --> 28:26.200
TO FINALLY MEET YOU BOTH.
I'VE HEARD SO MUCH ABOUT YOU.

28:26.200 --> 28:27.900
HEARD A LOT ABOUT YOU, TOO.

28:28.000 --> 28:32.000
CLAY AND I WERE SO SAD TO HEAR
YOU'D GOTTEN DIVORCED...

28:32.500 --> 28:33.800
AGAIN.

28:36.500 --> 28:37.300
THANK YOU.

28:37.700 --> 28:39.600
I'M, UH --
I'M DOING MUCH BETTER NOW.

28:40.800 --> 28:42.200
WELL, ENJOY YOUR VISIT.

28:42.200 --> 28:43.300
WILL DO.

28:43.400 --> 28:46.900
I EXPECT WE'LL BE SEEING YOU
AT BRENDA'S WEDDING.

28:46.900 --> 28:48.100
YOU TOO.

28:56.400 --> 28:57.400
CONGRATULATIONS.

28:57.400 --> 28:58.700
THANK YOU, CHIEF POPE.

28:59.900 --> 29:01.900
Provenza:
CONGRATULATIONS, CHIEF!

29:01.900 --> 29:04.300
CONGRATULATIONS!
THAT'S GREAT NEWS!

29:04.300 --> 29:07.600
CONGRATULATIONS,
WILLIE RAE, CLAY.

29:07.600 --> 29:09.800
UH, AGENT HOWARD.

29:09.800 --> 29:11.900
SO, HAVE YOU SET A DATE YET?

29:11.900 --> 29:13.300
HEY, CHIEF,
I'VE GOT GABRIEL ON THE --

29:13.300 --> 29:17.300
OH! PLEASE, PLEASE, PUT HIM
ON SPEAKERPHONE, LIEUTENANT.

29:18.400 --> 29:21.400
HEY, CHIEF,
CONROY'S ON THE MOVE.

29:21.400 --> 29:22.200
All right, Sergeant,

29:22.200 --> 29:24.300
PLEASE PERSUADE HIM TO JOIN US
HERE AT PARKER CENTER

29:24.300 --> 29:25.600
FOR THE DURATION OF HIS STAY.

29:25.600 --> 29:26.400
Thank you.

29:26.700 --> 29:27.700
YES, MA'AM.

29:39.800 --> 29:41.000
MR. CHEN.

29:42.700 --> 29:43.800
MISS JOHNSON,
YOU SHOULD KNOW

29:43.800 --> 29:47.600
I'VE ADVISED MY CLIENT
NOT TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS.

29:47.600 --> 29:50.200
WELL, THAT'S CERTAINLY
HIS RIGHT, MR. LANCE.

29:50.200 --> 29:52.200
HOWEVER, YOU MIGHT ALSO WANT
TO INFORM YOUR CLIENT

29:52.200 --> 29:54.400
THAT WHILE WE'RE NOT READY
TO CHARGE HIM WITH STATE CRIMES,

29:54.400 --> 29:57.000
WE ARE PREPARED TO TURN HIM OVER
TO A FEDERAL PROSECUTOR.

29:57.000 --> 29:59.000
ON WHAT CHARGES?

29:59.000 --> 30:02.300
MONEY LAUNDERING, TAX EVASION,
AND PROSTITUTION.

30:03.600 --> 30:05.400
OH.
DIDN'T MR. CHEN TELL YOU?

30:05.400 --> 30:08.100
HIS WIFE WAS A PROSTITUTE,
AS NOW WE SUSPECT ARE ALL --

30:08.100 --> 30:09.700
MY WIFE IS NOT
A PROSTITUTE!

30:09.700 --> 30:10.500
TAKE IT EASY.

30:16.700 --> 30:21.900
UNFORTUNATELY, MR. CHEN,
CHRIS CONROY BEGS TO DIFFER.

30:23.400 --> 30:25.100
IN FACT, HE REPORTS HAVING SEX
WITH YOUR WIFE

30:25.100 --> 30:27.500
AS RECENTLY AS THE NIGHT
BEFORE LAST.

30:27.500 --> 30:29.500
OR PERHAPS YOU DIDN'T KNOW
ABOUT THAT.

30:33.700 --> 30:34.800
MR. LANCE...

30:35.400 --> 30:38.900
SINCE EIGHT STARS TOURS IS OWNED
SOLELY IN PING-MEI'S NAME,

30:39.000 --> 30:40.500
I THINK AN EXCELLENT CASE
COULD BE MADE

30:40.500 --> 30:42.300
THAT MR. CHEN HERE
WAS UNAWARE

30:42.300 --> 30:45.600
OF HER BUSINESS'S
FINANCIAL IMPROPRIETIES.

30:45.600 --> 30:47.400
IF MR. CHEN WILL COOPERATE
WITH ME

30:47.400 --> 30:49.500
IN INVESTIGATING THE MURDER
OF HIS WIFE,

30:49.500 --> 30:52.500
I SEE NO REASON TO TURN HIM OVER
TO THE FEDERAL AUTHORITIES.

30:56.600 --> 30:57.600
UM...

31:04.500 --> 31:05.400
YES?

31:08.500 --> 31:10.700
CONROY IS PING-MEI'S
BUSINESS PARTNER.

31:10.700 --> 31:14.100
AND HOW MANY BUSINESS PARTNERS
DID YOU AND YOUR WIFE

31:14.100 --> 31:15.800
AND THE OTHER
TOUR GUIDES HAVE?

31:16.200 --> 31:17.600
IT IS NOT LIKE THAT.

31:17.600 --> 31:20.000
SO PING-MEI WAS <i>NOT</i>
A PROSTITUTE?

31:21.800 --> 31:26.000
WHEN MY WIFE FIRST COME HERE,
LIKE ME, SHE HAS NOTHING.

31:27.100 --> 31:31.100
AND SHE OWES MUCH
TO THE SNAKEHEAD.

31:31.100 --> 31:33.200
HE MAKE HER DO THINGS

31:33.200 --> 31:35.100
TO PAY HIM BACK.

31:37.000 --> 31:39.700
SHE HAS MUCH SHAME,

31:39.700 --> 31:41.500
BUT SHE SURVIVE.

31:43.000 --> 31:46.000
AND WHEN I FIRST MEET
PING-MEI,

31:46.600 --> 31:49.200
SHE IS READY TO BEGIN
NEW LIFE.

31:49.400 --> 31:51.700
SO WHY DOES SHE KEEP SEEING
MR. CONROY?

31:53.100 --> 31:57.300
HE MAKE PING-MEI PARTNER
AND BRING MY FAMILY HERE.

32:00.100 --> 32:03.100
CONROY TAKE MUCH
FOR WHAT HE GIVE.

32:05.200 --> 32:07.500
AND YOU CONTINUED
TO SHARE YOUR WIFE

32:07.500 --> 32:09.300
WITH MR. CONROY?

32:10.400 --> 32:11.900
THAT'S A LOT TO OVERLOOK.

32:11.900 --> 32:14.300
I COME TO UNITED STATES
ON A SHIP!

32:15.600 --> 32:17.000
IN A BOX!

32:21.200 --> 32:24.200
I AM NOT HAPPY
WITH WHAT I MUST DO,

32:24.300 --> 32:26.600
BUT WE SUFFER MORE
WHERE I COME FROM.

32:28.200 --> 32:31.900
AND YOU NEVER TOLD
MR. CONROY, "ENOUGH"?

32:31.900 --> 32:34.200
ONE YEAR AGO,
I SAY I WANT HIM GONE.

32:35.800 --> 32:37.400
WE OWE HIM NO MORE.

32:38.800 --> 32:39.900
BUT HE WILL NOT LET GO --

32:39.900 --> 32:43.000
NOT OF PING-MEI,
NOT OF EIGHT STAR.

32:43.500 --> 32:45.300
AND NOW THAT I TALK TO YOU,

32:45.800 --> 32:49.800
HE WILL KILL ME,
SAME AS HE KILL MY WIFE.

32:58.000 --> 32:59.500
ALL RIGHT, MR. CHEN.

33:00.600 --> 33:02.400
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

33:13.100 --> 33:13.700
 <i>XIE XIE?</i>

33:13.700 --> 33:16.099
 <i>MERCI BEAUCOUP.</i>
 <i>MUCHAS GRACIAS.</i>

33:16.100 --> 33:18.200
CHIEF, CONROY'S BEEN
READ HIS RIGHTS.

33:19.100 --> 33:20.000
ALL RIGHT.

33:22.100 --> 33:26.500
LIEUTENANT, UM, GIVEN
MR. CONROY'S ATTITUDES,

33:26.500 --> 33:27.500
YOU UNDERSTAND
WHERE YOU HAVE --

33:27.500 --> 33:29.700
I GOT IT, CHIEF.
NO NEED TO EXPLAIN.

33:36.500 --> 33:38.700
WHAT ARE YOU,
THE SECOND STRING?

33:39.200 --> 33:40.600
SIT.

33:45.300 --> 33:48.500
LET'S BEGIN WITH THE $100,000
OF UNREPORTED CASH

33:48.600 --> 33:50.600
RECOVERED FROM THE EIGHT STARS
OFFICE SAFE.

33:50.600 --> 33:52.600
THAT BELONGS TO YOU,
DOESN'T IT, MR. CONROY?

33:52.600 --> 33:54.700
WELL, IF I SAY IT DOES,
CAN I KEEP IT?

33:54.800 --> 33:56.600
I'LL TAKE THAT AS A YES.

33:59.100 --> 34:02.800
40-BIT ENCRYPTION.
YOU WEREN'T EVEN TRYING.

34:02.800 --> 34:04.200
WE HAVE EVERYTHING --

34:04.200 --> 34:06.300
TRANSFERS FROM EIGHT STARS
TO OFFSHORE ACCOUNTS,

34:06.300 --> 34:08.500
CASH PAYOUTS WITH DATES,
TIMES, PLACES.

34:09.100 --> 34:11.900
BUT ALL THAT AMOUNTS TO,
IF IT CAN BE PROVEN,

34:12.300 --> 34:13.900
IS A SHORT STAY IN PRISON.

34:14.400 --> 34:16.400
YOU'LL DO LIFE FOR MURDERING
PING-MEI ZHANG.

34:16.400 --> 34:18.000
I DID NOT KILL PING-MEI.

34:18.000 --> 34:19.800
THAT'S NOT HOW IT LOOKS TO ME,
MR. CONROY,

34:19.800 --> 34:20.900
AND MORE IMPORTANTLY,

34:20.900 --> 34:22.500
THAT'S NOT HOW IT'S GONNA LOOK
TO A JURY.

34:22.500 --> 34:23.600
BASED ON WHAT?

34:23.600 --> 34:26.000
BASED ON WHAT YOU SAID
YOURSELF.

34:26.000 --> 34:28.900
THE VICTIM WANTED TO END
YOUR RELATIONSHIP.

34:30.699 --> 34:33.300
20 MINUTES BEFORE
SHE WAS FOUND DEAD...

34:37.400 --> 34:40.199
...PING-MEI WAS WITH YOU.

34:40.699 --> 34:44.699
ALL RIGHT. I GET IT.
NOW YOU LISTEN TO ME, OKAY?

34:45.000 --> 34:47.000
HER HUSBAND WAS
AN UNGRATEFUL BASTARD

34:47.000 --> 34:50.100
WHO RESENTED EVERYTHING
I'D GIVEN HIM -- <i>GIVEN,</i> OKAY?

34:50.100 --> 34:54.500
HIS LIFE, HIS FAMILY --
EVERYTHING -- FROM THIS HAND.

34:54.500 --> 34:56.900
NOW, FIND REN-DI.

34:56.900 --> 34:58.200
YOU BRING HIM IN HERE!

35:01.100 --> 35:02.600
THEN WE'LL TALK AGAIN.

35:02.600 --> 35:04.600
AS A MATTER OF FACT,
TWO HOURS AGO,

35:04.600 --> 35:05.600
WE PICKED MR. CHEN UP

35:05.600 --> 35:09.200
ON HIS WAY INTO THE TRANS CHINA
AIR TERMINAL AT L.A.X.

35:09.200 --> 35:11.000
WELL, THERE IT IS.

35:11.000 --> 35:12.500
Flynn:
WHAT THE HELL'S TAO DOING?

35:12.500 --> 35:13.500
HE'S PRESSING THE GUY,

35:13.500 --> 35:15.500
AND HE'S DROPPING THE RED FLAG
ON THE HUSBAND.

35:15.500 --> 35:17.000
THAT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.

35:17.000 --> 35:19.600
HE WAS TRYING
TO FLEE THE COUNTRY? WHY?

35:19.800 --> 35:22.100
BECAUSE HE KILLED HIS WIFE.
YOU KNOW IT.

35:26.700 --> 35:29.900
YOU'RE USING REN-DI TO BUILD
A CASE AGAINST ME.

35:36.600 --> 35:38.000
HOW ARE WE DOING
WITH TIME, CHIEF?

35:38.400 --> 35:40.100
RIGHT ON SCHEDULE,
LIEUTENANT.

35:40.100 --> 35:43.500
AND, UM, WELL DONE.
THANK YOU.

35:49.500 --> 35:50.600
MR. CHEN,

35:51.100 --> 35:52.800
YOU BELIEVE THAT
THE PERSON RESPONSIBLE

35:52.800 --> 35:55.400
FOR YOUR WIFE'S DEATH
IS MR. CONROY.

35:55.400 --> 35:56.200
NOT SURPRISINGLY,

35:56.200 --> 35:58.700
MR. CONROY HAS AN ALTERNATE
VERSION OF EVENTS.

35:58.700 --> 36:01.100
THEREFORE, I THOUGHT THE
SIMPLEST AND MOST EFFECTIVE WAY

36:01.100 --> 36:02.600
TO GET TO THE TRUTH

36:02.900 --> 36:05.600
MIGHT BE TO HAVE YOU BOTH
SIT DOWN TOGETHER.

36:14.000 --> 36:16.100
 <i>MR. CONROY,</i>
 <i>HAVE A SEAT, PLEASE.</i>

36:20.400 --> 36:23.400
SINCE YOU BOTH HAVE A DEEP
ATTACHMENT TO THE SAME WOMAN,

36:23.400 --> 36:25.600
I SHOULD THINK YOU'D HAVE
A LOT TO DISCUSS.

36:25.600 --> 36:28.400
I DID <i>NOT</i> KILL PING-MEI.

36:28.700 --> 36:31.600
AND FROM WHAT YOUR DETECTIVE
SAID, IT'S CLEAR WHO DID.

36:31.600 --> 36:35.200
THAT PERSON...
SHOULD PAY FOR IT.

36:36.700 --> 36:37.800
I'M SORRY, MR. CONROY.

36:37.800 --> 36:40.400
DID I JUST HEAR YOU THREATEN
MR. CHEN'S LIFE?

36:40.400 --> 36:41.800
NO, YOU DIDN'T.

36:42.600 --> 36:44.200
BUT IF HE MURDERED HER,

36:44.200 --> 36:46.800
I DO BELIEVE THAT HE SHOULD BE
PUNISHED FOR THAT,

36:46.800 --> 36:49.500
AND I THINK HE WILL BE.

36:49.600 --> 36:52.900
MR. CHEN, I NOTICE YOU KEEP
CHECKING YOUR WATCH.

36:52.900 --> 36:54.600
I CAN TELL YOU DEFINITIVELY

36:54.600 --> 36:56.900
THAT TRANS CHINA AIR FLIGHT
NUMBER 204

36:56.900 --> 36:58.600
HAS BEEN IN THE AIR
FOR 30 MINUTES,

36:58.600 --> 37:00.600
AND YOU ARE <i>NOT</i> ON IT.

37:01.900 --> 37:05.400
NO.
I AM NOT ON THIS FLIGHT.

37:06.000 --> 37:09.700
BUT MY FATHER IS,
AND SOON HE WILL BE IN SHANGHAI,

37:09.700 --> 37:12.000
FAR FROM YOU
AND FAR FROM CONROY.

37:12.000 --> 37:13.600
THAT'S ENOUGH.
NO, I NO TALK TO HER!

37:14.300 --> 37:17.200
I TALK TO HIM!
WHY WOULD YOU SEND YOUR FATHER
TO SHANGHAI?

37:17.200 --> 37:19.300
YOU TOLD US MR. CONROY
WAS THE KILLER.

37:19.500 --> 37:23.000
YOU TELL US
HOW WE MUST RUN COMPANY.

37:23.000 --> 37:25.700
WE WORK,
AND THEN YOU TAKE MONEY!

37:26.100 --> 37:29.900
YOU WANT PING-MEI,
SO YOU HAVE PING-MEI!

37:29.900 --> 37:31.300
BUT THAT IS NOT ENOUGH!

37:31.300 --> 37:32.100
NO!

37:32.300 --> 37:35.300
YOU MAKE MY FATHER SEE
WHAT NO FATHER SHOULD SEE!

37:35.700 --> 37:37.600
YOU COME AND GO
IN FRONT OF HIM

37:37.600 --> 37:40.000
AND DO NOT LET HIM
LOOK PAST MY SHAME!

37:40.200 --> 37:42.400
I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT THE HELL
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT!

37:42.400 --> 37:47.800
MY FATHER SEES YOU WITH PING-MEI
BECAUSE YOU WANT HIM TO!

37:47.800 --> 37:50.700
AND WHEN MY FATHER ASKS PING-MEI
TO NOT SEE YOU ANYMORE,

37:50.700 --> 37:52.700
SHE SAYS SHE MUST,

37:52.700 --> 37:55.300
THAT MY FATHER IS ONLY HERE
BECAUSE OF YOU.

37:58.600 --> 38:00.900
MY FATHER IS NOT WELL.

38:01.800 --> 38:04.000
HE DOES NOT TAKE
TO THIS COUNTRY.

38:06.500 --> 38:08.700
YOUR FATHER STRUCK PING-MEI
WITH THE WRENCH

38:08.700 --> 38:10.600
AND MADE YOU COVER IT UP?

38:13.500 --> 38:15.200
NO.

38:15.500 --> 38:19.100
MY FATHER FEELS SORRY
FOR ME.

38:19.100 --> 38:22.200
BUT HE FEEL NO SHAME
THAT HE KILL PING-MEI.

38:26.000 --> 38:26.900
WHEN HE FIRST SEE YOU,

38:26.900 --> 38:30.600
HE WANT ME TO TELL YOU THIS,
BUT I SAY "NO!"

38:30.600 --> 38:34.400
BECAUSE I KNOW IT IS CONROY
THAT MAKE THIS HAPPEN!

38:36.300 --> 38:38.300
THANK YOU, MR. CHEN.

38:40.800 --> 38:41.900
Sergeant.

38:42.400 --> 38:43.100
LET'S GO.

38:43.100 --> 38:44.700
WHAT? THAT'S IT?

38:44.900 --> 38:47.000
NO, H-HIS FATHER
KILLED HER.

38:47.000 --> 38:49.800
HE'S GONNA GO FREE?
WHAT ABOUT EXTRADITION?

38:49.900 --> 38:51.800
LET'S GO.

38:57.400 --> 39:00.800
AND I <i>PAID</i>
TO BRING YOU HERE.

39:03.500 --> 39:05.000
Gabriel:
TO THE RIGHT.

39:09.400 --> 39:11.100
DETECTIVE SANCHEZ.

39:23.400 --> 39:24.900
MR. CHEN.

39:26.400 --> 39:28.400
I KNOW HOW YOU MUST FEEL.

39:30.000 --> 39:31.500
DON'T BLAME YOURSELF.

39:31.700 --> 39:32.900
YOU COULDN'T HAVE EXPECTED

39:32.900 --> 39:35.000
THAT WE KNEW THAT YOU PURCHASED
THAT TICKET

39:35.000 --> 39:36.200
IN YOUR FATHER'S NAME

39:36.200 --> 39:39.000
OR THAT, AFTER PICKING YOU UP
AT THE AIRPORT,

39:39.000 --> 39:40.300
WE LET YOUR FATHER
GO THROUGH SECURITY

39:40.300 --> 39:42.100
AND THEN PICKED HIM UP, TOO.

39:43.300 --> 39:46.800
????

40:19.400 --> 40:21.500
CHIEF, WOULD YOU LIKE ME
TO FIND A TRANSLATOR?

40:21.500 --> 40:23.400
NO.
THANK YOU, BUZZ.

40:23.400 --> 40:25.500
I HAVE A DOCTOR'S APPOINTMENT
IN 30 MINUTES.

40:25.600 --> 40:27.500
BESIDES, I THINK WE UNDERSTAND
WELL ENOUGH

40:27.500 --> 40:29.100
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE.

40:31.000 --> 40:33.100
I CAN READ
THE TRANSLATION LATER.

41:03.700 --> 41:05.300
FIRST, THE GOOD NEWS.

41:05.300 --> 41:06.600
IT'S NOT CANCER.

41:06.600 --> 41:08.600
Willie Rae:
OH, THANK THE LORD.

41:08.600 --> 41:11.000
MAMA, PLEASE, JUST...

41:13.100 --> 41:15.900
SORRY.
GO ON, DR. DIOLI.

41:15.900 --> 41:21.100
OKAY, THE ULTRASOUND REVEALED
POLYCYSTIC OVARIAN SYNDROME.

41:21.100 --> 41:24.200
IT'S BENIGN GROWTHS
ON THE OVARIES,

41:24.200 --> 41:27.800
WHICH, I BELIEVE, IS CAUSING
YOUR PERIMENOPAUSAL SYMPTOMS.

41:27.800 --> 41:29.500
AND THE TREATMENT OPTIONS?

41:29.500 --> 41:33.300
WELL, P.C.O.S. SEEMS TO BE
RELATED TO INSULIN RESISTANCE,

41:33.300 --> 41:35.500
SO THE FIRST THING
THAT I WOULD RECOMMEND

41:35.500 --> 41:41.400
IS THAT YOU CUT OUT
ALL SWEETS, CANDY, CAKE.

41:45.200 --> 41:46.100
NO.

41:46.900 --> 41:49.000
YOU <i>DON'T</i> HAVE CANCER.

41:49.000 --> 41:50.500
Dr. Dioli:
THE MOST AGGRESSIVE APPROACH

41:50.500 --> 41:54.200
TOWARDS REVERSING
THE EARLY ONSET MENOPAUSE

41:54.200 --> 41:57.400
WOULD BE AN OVULATION
INDUCTION AGENT

41:57.400 --> 42:03.300
AND A LAPAROSCOPIC PROCEDURE
KNOWN AS OVARIAN DRILLING.

42:03.800 --> 42:06.500
OVARIAN DRILLING.

42:08.900 --> 42:12.100
OVARIAN...

42:12.100 --> 42:14.000
DRILLING.

42:16.000 --> 42:17.700
WELL, THAT DOESN'T SOUND
TOO BAD.

42:17.700 --> 42:19.600
THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO

42:19.600 --> 42:21.500
WITH MY WANTING MORE
GRANDCHILDREN.

42:21.500 --> 42:25.500
YOU DO THIS, AND I'LL STAY
AND HELP YOU RECOVER.

42:27.000 --> 42:28.400
WHAT DO YOU SAY, HUH?

42:29.300 --> 42:31.900
AND THIS WILL STOP
THNOPAUSE?

42:31.900 --> 42:35.600
WELL, UNTIL IT WOULD OCCUR
NATURALLY, YES.

42:35.600 --> 42:37.900
SCHEDULE IT AS IF
WE WEREN'T HERE.

42:39.300 --> 42:41.000
OKAY, UM...

42:41.700 --> 42:46.800
I CAN DO
THE LAPAROSCOPY ON...

42:46.800 --> 42:49.200
NEXT WEDNESDAY, 4:00 P.M.

42:49.300 --> 42:50.200
UH...

42:51.000 --> 42:52.900
UH, YES, LET'S --

42:53.500 --> 42:55.800
NOPE.
DEPARTMENTAL BUDGET MEETING.

42:55.800 --> 43:01.000
UH, HOW ABOUT FRIDAY,
9:00 A.M.?

43:01.300 --> 43:03.300
UH...HMM...

43:04.100 --> 43:06.400
NO.
PRESENTING A CASE STUDY.

43:06.400 --> 43:08.700
TICKTOCK
TICKTOCK TICKTOCK.

43:09.800 --> 43:11.800
FINE, MAMA, FINE.

43:12.500 --> 43:14.300
WEDNESDAY IT IS.
