WEBVTT

00:02.360 --> 00:04.362
WOMAN:
<i>The year is 2048.</i>

00:04.364 --> 00:07.164
<i>Evolving technologies</i>
<i>can no longer be regulated.</i>

00:07.166 --> 00:11.768
Dangerous advancements forever
alter the criminal landscape.

00:11.770 --> 00:15.038
Police are not prepared.

00:15.040 --> 00:17.440
Law enforcement combats
<i>this corruption</i>

00:17.442 --> 00:21.044
with a new line of defense.

00:21.046 --> 00:24.146
But not all are created equal.

00:26.449 --> 00:29.785
RUDY: <i>The idea behind the DRNs
was to be as human as possible.</i>

00:29.787 --> 00:32.188
They were based on a program
<i>called Synthetic Soul.</i>

00:32.189 --> 00:33.455
JOHN:
That's one of the crazy ones.

00:33.457 --> 00:35.324
- I'll lead you in?
- Let's go.

00:35.326 --> 00:37.059
WOMAN:
<i>Now all cops...</i>

00:37.061 --> 00:39.794
human and manmade together...

00:39.796 --> 00:43.898
<i>take on the battle</i>
<i>to watch over us all.</i>

00:48.136 --> 00:49.537
All right, listen up.

00:49.539 --> 00:50.538
Last night's solar flare
knocked out power

00:50.540 --> 00:51.972
approximately six hours ago.

00:51.974 --> 00:53.907
In accordance
with the rolling blackouts,

00:53.909 --> 00:55.309
we're going to start
using auxiliary power

00:55.311 --> 00:56.376
in about two minutes.

00:56.378 --> 00:57.611
What genius put you in charge?

00:57.613 --> 00:59.313
Captain Maldonado did.

00:59.315 --> 01:00.714
Hm.

01:00.716 --> 01:02.449
And as our energy marshal,

01:02.451 --> 01:03.883
I must inform you
that our charge ration protocol

01:03.885 --> 01:05.251
is in effect.

01:05.254 --> 01:07.354
All androids are being charged
at a priority basis.

01:07.356 --> 01:08.522
That means not all
of your androids

01:08.524 --> 01:09.922
are gonna be fully charged.

01:09.924 --> 01:12.091
The good news is
the donut machine

01:12.093 --> 01:13.426
does have a full charge.

01:13.428 --> 01:14.493
But we are
out of chocolate sprinkles.

01:14.495 --> 01:16.195
Kennex, please.

01:16.197 --> 01:17.530
Shut up.

01:17.532 --> 01:19.998
As long as your androids are
in the green level

01:20.000 --> 01:21.434
on the energy,
then they're cleared for duty.

01:21.436 --> 01:23.035
And I don't want
to hear any complaining

01:23.037 --> 01:25.303
that your synthetics
are running too slow.

01:25.305 --> 01:26.504
That includes you, Kennex.

01:26.506 --> 01:28.139
And your leg.

01:28.141 --> 01:30.074
Hey, pal, I've had it
up to here with you.

01:30.076 --> 01:31.976
(laughter) Oh, that's funny.

01:31.978 --> 01:33.144
Why don't you slip into
something more comfortable,

01:33.146 --> 01:34.379
like a coma?

01:34.381 --> 01:36.448
(grunts)

01:36.450 --> 01:38.916
What the hell was that?

01:38.918 --> 01:40.818
That's for giving
the MXes charging priority!

01:40.820 --> 01:41.918
PAUL:
It's policy!

01:41.920 --> 01:42.953
I'm gonna write you up, android.

01:42.955 --> 01:44.555
(grunting quietly)

01:44.557 --> 01:46.923
Let him go.

01:46.925 --> 01:49.059
I'm sorry, that was wrong.

01:49.061 --> 01:51.094
- But it is your fault.
- What?

01:51.096 --> 01:53.163
You don't understand.
I barely got half a charge.

01:53.165 --> 01:55.232
And it messes me up
emotionally, man.

01:56.334 --> 01:57.933
Are we cool?

01:57.935 --> 01:59.101
Say we're c...

01:59.103 --> 02:00.803
We're cool, okay? Back up.

02:00.805 --> 02:02.772
As long as we're cool, yeah.

02:02.774 --> 02:04.006
We'll see what happens
at your, uh,

02:04.008 --> 02:05.808
next fit-for-service review.

02:05.810 --> 02:07.443
All right, Captain Energy,
you can take your cape off.

02:07.445 --> 02:08.344
(laughs)

02:09.513 --> 02:11.381
He's obviously
not fit for duty.

02:11.383 --> 02:14.349
I'd take a partially charged DRN
over a fully charged MX any day.

02:14.351 --> 02:15.850
Come on.

02:15.852 --> 02:18.754
This charging thing's
not acceptable, man.

02:18.756 --> 02:20.155
- It's not fair.
- All right, there it is, people.

02:20.157 --> 02:21.156
Back to work.

02:22.425 --> 02:23.992
Real nice.

02:23.994 --> 02:25.794
- Where were you on that, huh?
- I was waiting...

02:25.796 --> 02:27.429
Oh, shut up.

02:27.431 --> 02:28.930
Go get me a coffee, black.

02:30.499 --> 02:31.799
Two sugars.

02:32.000 --> 02:35.074
Subtitles downloaded from Podnapisi.NET

02:40.208 --> 02:42.075
You, uh,

02:42.077 --> 02:44.912
you get a little cranky when
you don't get enough sleep, huh?

02:44.914 --> 02:46.980
My personality interface is
the first thing that suffers.

02:46.982 --> 02:49.183
Then all my other systems
gradually shutdown

02:49.185 --> 02:50.818
in an effort to save energy.

02:50.820 --> 02:52.085
It's infuriating!

02:52.087 --> 02:54.021
MXes always take priority.

02:54.023 --> 02:56.056
Th-They're sitting in first
class and I'm sitting in coach.

02:56.058 --> 02:57.925
Yeah, I tell you,
that coach is the pits.

02:57.927 --> 02:59.059
All those people and
you got to share

02:59.061 --> 03:00.794
the same tiny bathroom.

03:00.796 --> 03:02.161
I'm talking
about a social injustice here.

03:02.163 --> 03:03.129
And you're talking
about tiny bathrooms.

03:03.131 --> 03:04.297
I need my own space, John.

03:04.299 --> 03:05.798
Oh, come on, not this again.

03:05.800 --> 03:07.133
Yes, and we're gonna
keep talking about it

03:07.135 --> 03:08.267
until you talk to the captain.

03:08.269 --> 03:09.302
I talked to the captain.

03:09.304 --> 03:10.803
What'd she say?

03:10.805 --> 03:12.404
She says you're city property.

03:12.406 --> 03:14.207
You have to be supervised,
even when you're off-duty.

03:14.209 --> 03:16.108
Okay? That's just
the way it is.

03:16.110 --> 03:17.909
- I'm sorry. I tried.
- (grunts)

03:23.482 --> 03:25.817
What about your place?

03:25.819 --> 03:27.485
- My place?
- Mm-hmm.

03:27.487 --> 03:29.454
- What about my place?
- The back room.

03:29.456 --> 03:31.122
- The back...?
- Can I have it?

03:31.124 --> 03:32.390
- Back room? My back room?
- The back room at your place.

03:32.392 --> 03:33.391
- No, no.
- The back room.

03:33.393 --> 03:35.059
No, no, no, no, no.

03:35.061 --> 03:36.393
That's-that's-that's
my trophy room.

03:36.395 --> 03:37.761
- Your what?
- Yeah, that's my trophy room.

03:37.763 --> 03:39.196
That was high school, man.

03:39.198 --> 03:40.464
- I know.
- Time to move on.

03:40.466 --> 03:41.465
Time to grow up.

03:41.467 --> 03:43.133
Mo...? Easy for you to say.

03:43.135 --> 03:45.302
You weren't all-city
three years in a row.

03:45.304 --> 03:47.238
- All what?
- All-city.

03:47.240 --> 03:49.073
Three years running.
Man, I tell you,

03:49.075 --> 03:50.240
you walk into that gym today,

03:50.242 --> 03:51.774
you look up in the rafters

03:51.776 --> 03:53.509
and all my records
are still up there.

03:53.511 --> 03:54.978
Single season passing yards:

03:54.980 --> 03:58.181
Kennex, 3,256.

03:58.183 --> 04:00.316
Most touchdowns
in school history:

04:00.318 --> 04:01.284
Kennex.

04:01.286 --> 04:03.353
Brags about himself:
Kennex.

04:03.355 --> 04:05.721
Come on, can't I relive
a few glory days?

04:05.723 --> 04:07.722
That's all you got left.
May as well.

04:07.724 --> 04:09.457
Oh, I can still
hear those crowds.

04:09.459 --> 04:11.426
"Kennex! Kennex!"

04:11.428 --> 04:13.161
I was fast.
You should've seen me.

04:13.163 --> 04:15.463
They used to call me
the White Cheetah

04:15.465 --> 04:18.200
on account of the fact
that I was so fast.

04:18.202 --> 04:20.969
(roars)

04:20.971 --> 04:22.970
Hey.

04:22.972 --> 04:25.206
They used to call me
the White Cheetah

04:25.208 --> 04:27.341
on account of the fact
that I was so fast.

04:27.343 --> 04:30.111
It's like, "Cheetah! Cheetah!"

04:30.113 --> 04:33.480
MAN: <i>So, when do you think</i>
<i>you're gonna get home?</i>

04:33.482 --> 04:35.016
WOMAN: Well, as long as Ken
doesn't want us to start us

04:35.018 --> 04:36.750
on the Arctic project yet...
maybe 6:00?

04:36.752 --> 04:37.952
What do you think about making

04:37.953 --> 04:39.352
your famous spinach lasagna
for us?

04:39.354 --> 04:41.487
Oh, Ramon, I'd have
toto go to the store.

04:41.489 --> 04:42.923
Can't we just order in?

04:42.925 --> 04:44.324
Oh, come on.

04:44.326 --> 04:46.127
'I've been making dinners
for the past months.

04:46.128 --> 04:49.329
And actually I'm dying
for an edible meal.

04:49.331 --> 04:50.730
Well, in that case.

04:50.732 --> 04:52.542
(tires screech)

04:53.196 --> 04:54.168
Ramon?

04:55.268 --> 04:56.969
No.
No, no, no, no, no.

04:56.971 --> 04:58.437
No, no, I don't need,
I don't need...

04:58.439 --> 04:59.838
I don't need.

04:59.840 --> 05:00.973
(sighs)

05:00.975 --> 05:02.975
- Everything okay?
- Yeah, just some guy.

05:02.977 --> 05:04.209
- I'll call you back. - ELECTRONIC
VOICE: Call terminated.

05:04.211 --> 05:05.210
Hi, there.

05:06.313 --> 05:07.712
I'll see if I have anything.

05:07.714 --> 05:08.780
You know, this is really...

05:08.782 --> 05:10.181
(grunting, coughs)

What is this?!

05:37.276 --> 05:38.741
FEMALE ELECTRONIC VOICE:
Ready to play?

05:38.743 --> 05:40.143
Who are you?

ELECTRONIC VOICE:
Follow the instruction

05:41.447 --> 05:43.245
if you want to live.

05:43.247 --> 05:44.746
Do not deviate.

05:44.748 --> 05:45.747
I am watching.

05:50.954 --> 05:52.754
Who's doing this?

05:54.858 --> 05:56.459
What do you want from me?

ELECTRONIC VOICE:
Once you accomplish these tasks,

05:58.195 --> 06:01.363
I will tell you
how to disarm the bomb.

06:01.365 --> 06:03.264
RAMON:
A bomb?

06:05.368 --> 06:06.401
Step One.

06:06.403 --> 06:08.703
Open the briefcase.

06:11.007 --> 06:12.874
ELECTRONIC VOICE:
Step number two.

06:12.876 --> 06:14.741
Go to the bank where you work.

06:14.743 --> 06:16.843
RAMON:
Tell me what's going on here!

06:16.845 --> 06:19.446
What are you doing to me?!

06:36.363 --> 06:38.998
Ramon, you're back.

06:39.000 --> 06:41.800
What is that?

06:41.802 --> 06:44.170
Vilma, I-I'm sorry.

06:44.172 --> 06:45.171
I need your help.

06:45.173 --> 06:46.771
I need you to transfer

06:46.773 --> 06:49.174
$427,000 onto this device.

06:49.176 --> 06:50.308
What?

06:50.310 --> 06:52.710
I-I can't.
You know that.

06:53.913 --> 06:55.880
Ramon, what are you doing?

06:55.882 --> 06:57.782
I'm sorry, someone's
making me do this.

06:57.784 --> 06:59.751
If I don't, they'll kill me.

06:59.753 --> 07:01.353
(quietly):
Please.

07:06.391 --> 07:08.759
Hurry, I don't want to have
to hurt anybody.

07:15.267 --> 07:17.901
(quiet laugh)

07:20.204 --> 07:21.871
I don't have much time.

07:21.873 --> 07:23.206
- Okay, okay, okay.
- Please!

07:23.208 --> 07:24.207
It's almost done.

07:24.209 --> 07:25.375
Hurry, I...

07:28.779 --> 07:30.661
Please!

07:32.783 --> 07:35.016
RAMON: <i>I have your money.</i>
<i>What do you want me to do?</i>

07:35.018 --> 07:36.418
ELECTRONIC VOICE: Ready for the
code to disarm the bomb?

07:36.420 --> 07:37.752
Yes, yes.

07:37.754 --> 07:40.122
Yes!

07:40.124 --> 07:41.823
JOHN: <i>Show us responding.</i>
<i>We have eyes on a vehicle</i>

07:41.825 --> 07:44.059
matching the description
of the bank robber's car.

07:44.061 --> 07:45.461
(amplified):
Police. Pull over.

07:45.463 --> 07:47.296
Dude! Roll the window down!

07:49.699 --> 07:51.733
(amplified):
Police! Pull over!

07:51.735 --> 07:53.802
My bad.
Yeah.

07:55.471 --> 07:58.406
ELECTRONIC VOICE: If you want to
live, do not pull over.

07:58.408 --> 08:01.076
All right, let's shut him down.

08:01.078 --> 08:03.945
(tires screeching)

08:13.688 --> 08:15.768
ELECTRONIC VOICE: Do not stop
under any circumstance.

08:36.442 --> 08:37.708
ELECTRONIC VOICE:
Run now.

08:39.145 --> 08:42.014
Police!

08:42.015 --> 08:44.182
Aah, no! Don't...

08:45.685 --> 08:47.085
Dorian, there's something
around his neck.

08:47.087 --> 08:48.786
What is that?

08:50.189 --> 08:52.390
They said it's a bomb.
DORIAN: Get back, John.

08:52.392 --> 08:53.424
Somebody put this on me.

08:53.426 --> 08:55.026
I need to follow instructions.

08:55.028 --> 08:56.694
I need the code to shut it off.

08:56.696 --> 08:57.795
It is a bomb.

08:57.797 --> 08:59.096
Who did this to you?

08:59.098 --> 09:00.798
Uh, a window washer.

09:00.800 --> 09:02.099
He had some kind of chemical.
Get it off me!

09:02.101 --> 09:05.402
- It's live.
- Can you disarm it?

09:05.404 --> 09:07.871
It would take me at least five
minutes to find the lead wire.

09:07.873 --> 09:08.872
(groans)

09:08.874 --> 09:10.374
There's not enough time.

09:10.376 --> 09:12.209
Please.

09:12.211 --> 09:14.431
Put up the shield.

09:15.647 --> 09:18.750
John... put up the shield.

09:28.225 --> 09:30.326
I'm sorry.

09:32.296 --> 09:34.430
We will find
who did this to you.

09:34.432 --> 09:36.864
I promise.

09:36.866 --> 09:39.167
We will find them.

09:42.173 --> 09:43.985
There's nothing I can do.

09:54.592 --> 09:55.926
Tell my wife I...

10:07.348 --> 10:09.262
There just wasn't enough time.

10:30.070 --> 10:32.238
He said something
about a window washer

10:32.240 --> 10:33.172
and a chemical.

10:33.174 --> 10:36.542
Can you detect anything?

10:37.844 --> 10:40.513
Traces of fetanyl oxide.

10:40.515 --> 10:41.814
A toxin that causes
temporary blackouts.

10:41.816 --> 10:44.717
Fetanyl oxide?
That's dangerous stuff.

10:44.719 --> 10:46.986
You could wake up find
an unwelcome roommate

10:46.988 --> 10:48.854
charging in your trophy room.

10:48.856 --> 10:50.188
You have no idea
how he got there.

10:50.190 --> 10:51.890
Do I look like
I'm in the mood, John?

10:51.892 --> 10:53.758
I'm vulnerable right now.

10:55.528 --> 10:58.496
Found the data recorder.

10:58.498 --> 11:00.498
Looks like the EMP blast fried
the circuits.

11:00.500 --> 11:02.567
It'll have to be reconstructed.

11:02.569 --> 11:03.835
Let's get that to Rudy ASAP

11:03.837 --> 11:05.570
and see where the car has been.

11:05.572 --> 11:06.470
Got a bitcoin.

11:06.472 --> 11:07.871
Any money on it?

11:07.873 --> 11:09.840
(electronic whirring)

11:10.875 --> 11:12.175
$427,000.

11:12.177 --> 11:13.644
Disco face, really?

11:13.646 --> 11:14.711
Yeah.

11:20.585 --> 11:22.585
A camera.

11:22.587 --> 11:24.787
They're all over the car.

11:24.789 --> 11:25.988
Someone was filming this?

11:25.990 --> 11:27.489
Yeah.

11:27.491 --> 11:28.724
Who does that, John?

11:28.726 --> 11:29.926
(bangs on roof)
That is sick, man.

11:29.928 --> 11:31.260
Dorian, will you stop

11:31.262 --> 11:32.895
punching things?

11:32.897 --> 11:34.063
I'm sorry.

11:34.065 --> 11:35.965
- (phone ringing)
- Low charge again.

11:35.967 --> 11:37.967
(ringing continues)

11:38.968 --> 11:40.602
Kennex.

11:40.604 --> 11:42.070
What are we dealing with,
a victim or a criminal?

11:42.072 --> 11:43.237
Victim,

11:43.239 --> 11:44.706
but he definitely robbed
the bank.

11:44.708 --> 11:45.774
We found the money.

11:45.776 --> 11:47.108
What about the bomb?

11:47.110 --> 11:49.778
Well, he claims someone
attached it to him.

11:49.780 --> 11:51.245
We found traces
of fetanyl oxide,

11:51.247 --> 11:53.982
and the whole car
is covered in cameras.

11:53.984 --> 11:55.248
You mean someone
was watching this?

11:55.250 --> 11:57.184
Yeah, or filming it.

11:57.186 --> 11:59.720
- What else? - Said he needed a
code to disarm the bomb,

11:59.722 --> 12:01.589
which he was gonna get
if he followed instructions.

12:01.591 --> 12:03.190
Instructions? From the bomber?

12:03.192 --> 12:04.725
I'm guessing.

12:04.727 --> 12:06.060
We also found the data recorder
for the car.

12:06.062 --> 12:07.595
We're getting it to Rudy ASAP.

12:07.597 --> 12:09.496
See what information
you can pull off of it.

12:09.498 --> 12:10.763
Copy that.

12:10.765 --> 12:11.898
PAUL:
<i>So why him?</i>

12:11.900 --> 12:13.766
Why target Ramon?

12:16.236 --> 12:17.470
I don't know.

12:17.472 --> 12:18.838
He was such a good guy.

12:18.840 --> 12:21.908
You know,
Ramon was about to take his wife

12:21.910 --> 12:23.977
on an orbit vacation.

12:23.979 --> 12:26.579
He couldn't stop talking
about it.

12:26.581 --> 12:28.046
Everybody loved him.

12:28.048 --> 12:29.047
Okay, well,
he was a loan officer.

12:29.049 --> 12:30.649
He must have made some enemies.

12:30.651 --> 12:33.551
Sometimes people have a
hard time being told no.

12:34.921 --> 12:37.589
Did anyone ever
threaten him before?

12:37.591 --> 12:40.792
Not that I know of, no.

12:40.794 --> 12:42.094
But it's true what you said.

12:42.096 --> 12:44.729
A lot of people can't accept
hearing no.

12:44.731 --> 12:47.131
How many people
did Ramon deny loans to?

12:47.133 --> 12:49.867
He worked at the bank
for almost a decade...

12:49.869 --> 12:52.169
- Thousands.
- Okay.

12:52.171 --> 12:54.271
We're gonna need to see
the files on all of them.

12:54.273 --> 12:55.906
VALERIE:
Captain,

12:55.908 --> 12:58.442
I need you right away.
What's going on?

12:58.444 --> 12:59.776
I need you to transfer...

12:59.778 --> 13:00.944
VALERIE: Whoever put the bomb
on Ramon Medina

13:00.946 --> 13:03.680
broadcast
the whole incident live.

13:03.682 --> 13:05.448
Cyber-crimes went
back and found this

13:05.450 --> 13:06.750
on an unpatrolled
area of the Internet.

13:06.752 --> 13:08.084
Hmm, dark net.

13:08.086 --> 13:09.986
- I don't have much time.
- Yeah.

13:09.988 --> 13:12.188
I know there's a lot of
disturbing video stream there,

13:12.190 --> 13:13.456
but shouldn't someone
be monitoring for murder?

13:13.458 --> 13:14.557
They are.

13:14.559 --> 13:16.458
They just can't keep up.

13:16.460 --> 13:17.526
JOHN:
Police! Pull over!

13:17.528 --> 13:18.894
And you think the person

13:18.896 --> 13:20.195
who put the cameras on this

13:20.197 --> 13:21.596
did it for attention?

13:21.598 --> 13:22.965
Not just attention, approval.

13:22.967 --> 13:24.599
This is about putting on a show.

13:24.601 --> 13:25.868
Police! And getting as
many views as possible.

13:25.870 --> 13:27.202
You'd be surprised

13:27.204 --> 13:29.938
how many get off on
this live violence.

13:29.940 --> 13:31.172
You should've seen
the comments.

13:31.174 --> 13:32.874
They wanted this
bomb to explode.

13:32.876 --> 13:34.608
What is this world coming to?

13:34.610 --> 13:35.743
DORIAN:
...find the lead wire...

13:35.745 --> 13:37.145
How many viewers watched this?

13:37.147 --> 13:40.081
It went from four to hundreds
to over 3,000.

13:40.083 --> 13:41.916
Can you find the original feed?

13:41.918 --> 13:43.785
Not yet. It was rerouted
via encrypted software.

13:43.787 --> 13:45.219
DORIAN (on video):
John,

13:45.221 --> 13:47.487
- we have to put up the shield.
- JOHN: I'm sorry.

13:47.489 --> 13:48.822
No, no, no, no!

13:48.824 --> 13:50.157
DORIAN:
There's nothing we can do.

13:50.159 --> 13:52.793
(Ramon gasping anxiously)

13:52.795 --> 13:55.261
Tell my wife I...

13:55.263 --> 13:57.497
Yeah.

13:58.666 --> 14:00.067
(sighs)

14:00.069 --> 14:02.602
What kind of bomb was it?

14:02.604 --> 14:03.869
Propylene oxide.

14:03.871 --> 14:05.537
The filler is typical,
but the wiring

14:05.539 --> 14:07.073
is very sophisticated...
multiple decoys.

14:07.075 --> 14:08.473
I'm still trying
to reconstruct it.

14:08.475 --> 14:10.176
This charger is an insult,
Dr. Lom.

14:10.178 --> 14:12.178
Well, at least it will give you

14:12.180 --> 14:14.580
a jolt of energy,
like an espresso shot.

14:14.582 --> 14:17.149
(indistinct radio broadcast
in Asian language)

14:17.151 --> 14:18.817
JOHN: Dude, I think you're
picking Radio Korea.

14:18.819 --> 14:20.651
You'll be tip-top

14:20.653 --> 14:22.153
once the damage from
solar flare is dealt with.

14:22.155 --> 14:23.855
I want to move out.

14:23.857 --> 14:24.923
He doesn't want to
sleep with MXes.

14:24.925 --> 14:26.490
Well, who would, really?

14:26.492 --> 14:27.826
I shouldn't have to charge
with them, John.

14:27.828 --> 14:29.794
It's the law, Dorian.

14:29.796 --> 14:32.764
Look, having your own space
isn't all it's cracked up to be.

14:32.766 --> 14:34.665
Sure, you can build
robotic butterflies

14:34.667 --> 14:36.934
to your heart's content, but...

14:36.936 --> 14:38.102
it can get lonely.

14:38.104 --> 14:39.536
(indistinct radio broadcast)

14:39.538 --> 14:41.038
It can get really lonely.

14:42.073 --> 14:43.907
(radio broadcast continues)

14:43.909 --> 14:46.043
Is there anything
on the data recorder

14:46.045 --> 14:47.544
we found in the car?

14:47.546 --> 14:49.079
I'm running a recovery program.

14:49.081 --> 14:50.847
It should be about
finished now.

14:50.849 --> 14:52.014
(computer blips)

14:52.016 --> 14:53.549
Hey, uh, Rudy,

14:53.551 --> 14:55.551
do I need to worry
about Mr. Happy over there,

14:55.553 --> 14:58.855
and you know,
the reasons why DRNs were, uh...

14:58.857 --> 15:00.156
Decommissioned?

15:00.158 --> 15:02.424
Not, this is... this
is just a minor, uh,

15:02.426 --> 15:04.060
personality glitch.

15:04.062 --> 15:05.561
Nothing like the
erratic behavior

15:05.563 --> 15:07.729
that caused the DRNs
to be recalled.

15:07.731 --> 15:09.898
Dorian's vital functions

15:09.900 --> 15:11.499
shouldn't be
immediately affected.

15:11.501 --> 15:12.634
Of course, his, uh,

15:12.636 --> 15:13.834
his mood swings
could get worse,

15:13.836 --> 15:15.197
depending on his
level of activity.

15:17.439 --> 15:18.473
Humans, off.

15:18.475 --> 15:20.441
See what I have to deal with.

15:20.443 --> 15:22.009
Hard to charge,
too much chatter.

15:22.011 --> 15:23.678
Sorry.

15:23.680 --> 15:25.446
So, I was able to reconstruct

15:25.448 --> 15:27.214
the communication off
the card's data recorder.

15:27.216 --> 15:28.215
ELECTRONIC VOICE:
...follow my instructions

15:28.217 --> 15:29.783
if you want to live.

15:29.785 --> 15:31.885
And these messages were
transmitted to Mr. Medina,

15:31.887 --> 15:33.553
I believe, by the bomber,

15:33.555 --> 15:35.275
when he took over the
vehicle's comm system.

15:38.959 --> 15:41.895
Whoever did this has state
of the art security software.

15:41.897 --> 15:43.463
Wait a minute,
there's an address.

15:43.465 --> 15:46.198
This must be where
he was headed.

15:46.200 --> 15:48.734
And one last instruction.

15:48.736 --> 15:50.469
We should check it out.

15:50.471 --> 15:52.004
Hey, who's a happy toaster?

15:52.006 --> 15:53.506
RUDY: Told you,
every little bit helps.

15:53.508 --> 15:54.640
DORIAN:
When we stopped Ramon,

15:54.642 --> 15:56.041
that timer was under a minute.

15:56.043 --> 15:57.710
That address is ten miles away.

15:57.712 --> 15:58.944
He would've never made it,

15:58.946 --> 16:00.680
even if we hadn't
pulled him over.

16:00.682 --> 16:03.147
(Asian language
radio broadcast resumes)

16:03.149 --> 16:05.517
- Is he gonna be okay?
- RUDY: Yeah, that should stop soon.

16:05.519 --> 16:08.019
Come on, let's go
check out the address.

16:14.794 --> 16:15.893
Clear!

16:15.895 --> 16:17.728
- Clear.
- Clear.

16:17.730 --> 16:21.031
FEMALE VOICE: Three plays
for the price of one.

16:21.033 --> 16:22.466
DORIAN:
It's the only thing on.

16:22.468 --> 16:23.934
Three plays
for the price of one.

16:23.936 --> 16:25.602
Any explosives?

16:25.604 --> 16:27.604
DORIAN:
All clear.

16:27.606 --> 16:28.739
VOICE: Three plays for
the price of one.

16:28.741 --> 16:30.140
It said enter B-47.

16:32.944 --> 16:35.545
VOICE: Three plays for
the price of one.

16:39.049 --> 16:40.883
Thank you for your selection.

16:41.952 --> 16:43.953
(whirring, beeping)

16:50.526 --> 16:52.527
(gasps)

16:52.529 --> 16:54.229
He's watching us.

16:54.231 --> 16:55.897
He knew we'd see
the instructions.

16:55.899 --> 16:56.998
He knew we'd come here.

17:02.506 --> 17:04.638
Her name is Jeannie Hartman.

17:04.641 --> 17:06.874
She's the next victim.

17:06.906 --> 17:08.585
_

17:08.602 --> 17:11.448
_

17:21.865 --> 17:23.531
(phone rings)
Hello, can I help you?

17:23.534 --> 17:25.166
SIMON:
I want a dozen roses.

17:25.169 --> 17:27.435
(line crackling)
Yes. What color?

17:27.436 --> 17:29.104
A red-orange.

17:29.106 --> 17:30.505
I'm sorry, the solar flare

17:30.507 --> 17:32.274
really did a number
on the signals.

17:32.276 --> 17:33.909
The red-orange, did you say?

17:33.911 --> 17:36.411
(static crackling):
Yes, I'm on Fuller Road.

17:36.413 --> 17:38.613
I'm-I'm having
some trouble hearing.

17:38.615 --> 17:39.614
Uh, talk to my daughter,
Jeannie.

17:39.616 --> 17:41.016
She's the driver.

17:43.451 --> 17:45.319
Hi.
So, where are you?

17:48.256 --> 17:49.623
47 Fuller.

17:49.625 --> 17:51.825
Right next to the park.

17:51.827 --> 17:54.261
Okay, did you want
to include a message?

17:54.263 --> 17:56.063
No.

17:56.065 --> 17:58.498
All right, thanks for choosing
Mid-City Floral Boutique.

18:12.346 --> 18:14.914
DORIAN: <i>Mr. Hartman, we believe</i>
<i>your daughter may be in danger.</i>

18:14.916 --> 18:16.315
How long ago did Jeannie
<i>leave the shop?</i>

18:16.317 --> 18:17.449
20 minutes ago.
I-I tried calling,

18:17.451 --> 18:19.017
but she's not answering.

18:19.019 --> 18:21.353
Do you have a location
on the van?

18:21.355 --> 18:22.554
GPS says it stopped

18:22.556 --> 18:24.356
on Fuller Road, uh,
at Morris Park.

18:24.358 --> 18:25.557
Willows Park.

18:25.559 --> 18:26.925
I said "Morris Park."

18:26.927 --> 18:28.060
Wait, sorry.

18:28.062 --> 18:29.561
Yeah, yeah, Morris Park.

18:29.563 --> 18:31.329
We-we got it;
we know where that is.

18:31.331 --> 18:32.964
We're close.

18:32.966 --> 18:33.931
DORIAN: What do you remember
about the caller?

18:33.933 --> 18:35.099
I-I could barely hear him,

18:35.101 --> 18:36.267
but there was some kind
of static.

18:36.269 --> 18:37.601
My daughter, is she all right?

18:37.603 --> 18:40.338
We're gonna make sure she is.

19:03.793 --> 19:05.394
(filtered breathing)

19:06.863 --> 19:08.464
(collar bleeping)

19:11.567 --> 19:13.035
What have we got
on the missing girl?

19:13.037 --> 19:14.536
Yeah, Jeannie Hartman, 28.

19:14.538 --> 19:16.372
No arrests. Her dad owns a
flower shop where she works.

19:16.374 --> 19:18.007
Any connection
with the loan officer?

19:18.009 --> 19:19.840
Well, we checked their
social network and profiles,

19:19.842 --> 19:21.142
and no connection so far.

19:21.144 --> 19:23.411
MX: Captain, Detective Stahl
has asked for you.

19:23.413 --> 19:24.945
- She found something.
- Thank you.

19:24.947 --> 19:26.280
VALERIE:
The bomber's broadcasting.

19:26.282 --> 19:28.149
MALDONADO: When did the feed
start streaming?

19:28.151 --> 19:29.350
A little over
three minutes ago.

19:29.352 --> 19:31.019
Where on the dark net
does it originate?

19:31.021 --> 19:32.053
The signal's pinging
off different mirrors.

19:32.055 --> 19:33.121
I can't get an origin yet.

19:33.123 --> 19:34.522
John...

19:34.524 --> 19:36.890
it's me.
We found the live broadcast.

19:36.892 --> 19:38.225
I'm watching her online.

19:38.227 --> 19:39.859
JOHN:
We're almost there.

19:39.861 --> 19:42.095
(children shouting playfully)

19:42.097 --> 19:44.064
(whimpering, gasping)

19:46.234 --> 19:47.334
Kids...

19:47.336 --> 19:50.037
get away from here now.

19:51.905 --> 19:53.539
Now!

19:55.008 --> 19:56.909
(phone chimes)

19:58.578 --> 20:00.579
(whimpering continues)

20:07.020 --> 20:09.120
(phone chiming)

20:09.122 --> 20:13.024
?

20:23.101 --> 20:24.134
She's in the gazebo.

20:24.136 --> 20:25.369
JOHN:
Copy that.

20:25.371 --> 20:27.438
?

20:58.468 --> 21:00.435
Jeannie?

21:00.437 --> 21:02.036
I'm Detective John Kennex.

21:02.038 --> 21:03.205
This is my partner, Dorian.

21:03.207 --> 21:06.174
We're here to help, okay?

21:06.176 --> 21:09.877
?

21:09.879 --> 21:11.579
Rudy, we got another victim
wired with explosives.

21:11.581 --> 21:13.046
I'm gonna need your help

21:13.048 --> 21:14.948
so I can preserve
processing power.

21:14.950 --> 21:16.083
I'll patch you in.

21:16.085 --> 21:18.586
(collar beeping)

21:18.588 --> 21:20.488
- Just be as still as you can. - I don't
know if you should be doing this.

21:20.490 --> 21:22.389
He-he said
to follow instructions.

21:22.391 --> 21:23.591
Oh, it's gonna be okay.

21:23.593 --> 21:25.426
I promise.

21:25.428 --> 21:26.494
I know you're scared.

21:26.496 --> 21:27.927
Try and stay calm.

21:27.929 --> 21:29.596
We're gonna get
this thing off of you,

21:29.598 --> 21:31.431
but if I say anything
wildly inappropriate,

21:31.433 --> 21:32.599
please forgive me.

21:32.601 --> 21:34.900
Rudy, if I can just get
a better look

21:34.902 --> 21:36.503
at the Menace X device inside...

21:36.505 --> 21:37.870
Dorian, no.

21:37.872 --> 21:39.239
The device is

21:39.241 --> 21:40.973
an MXK-402.

21:40.975 --> 21:42.908
The circuitry
is totally different.

21:43.213 --> 21:45.080
RUDY: ...but it requires
a very specific series

21:45.082 --> 21:46.849
of sequential maneuvers,
which I will talk you through.

21:46.851 --> 21:48.817
Mind if I see that?
Uh-huh.

21:56.045 --> 21:57.264
You're doing great.

21:59.864 --> 22:01.569
Can I ***?

22:03.637 --> 22:05.231
_

22:05.351 --> 22:06.968
JEANNIE:
Please don't let me die.

22:16.208 --> 22:17.808
You're doing really great.

22:17.810 --> 22:19.109
Just relax, okay?
We're gonna have you

22:19.111 --> 22:20.510
out of here in a minute.

22:29.620 --> 22:30.620
(beeps)

22:32.622 --> 22:34.123
You're doing great, Jeannie.

22:34.125 --> 22:35.691
Doing really great.
Just hang in there.

22:35.693 --> 22:36.826
I know who did this.

22:36.828 --> 22:39.863
His name is Simon.
I, um...

22:39.865 --> 22:42.631
I met him online.

22:42.633 --> 22:44.467
He wanted me to meet him
at this park.

22:44.469 --> 22:46.602
Do you have a last name?

22:46.604 --> 22:47.686
No, I don't know any of that.

22:47.712 --> 22:49.604
I just know
his online dating profile.

22:49.606 --> 22:51.806
I can use a laser
to slice through

22:51.808 --> 22:54.176
- the locking mechanism.
- Don't! I mean...

22:54.178 --> 22:55.510
probably best not to.

22:55.512 --> 22:57.679
Um, it'll disrupt the circuit

22:57.681 --> 23:00.615
and set off the detonator.
Can you see a silver panel

23:00.617 --> 23:03.252
- closest to the timer?
- Copy. Yes.

23:03.254 --> 23:06.120
You need to get to the wires
underneath

23:06.122 --> 23:08.956
without cutting any of them.

23:08.958 --> 23:10.191
DORIAN:
Okay.

23:10.193 --> 23:11.625
I need you to be
very still, Jeannie.

23:11.627 --> 23:13.094
(text alerts beeping)

23:20.268 --> 23:22.235
- You're doing good.
- Okay.

23:22.237 --> 23:25.138
So tell me, this guy,
what does he look like?

23:25.140 --> 23:27.774
Um, he was tall,

23:27.776 --> 23:31.111
um, six feet, maybe,
with dark hair.

23:31.113 --> 23:33.246
JOHN: How long ago
did you meet him?

23:33.248 --> 23:34.814
A couple months ago.

23:34.816 --> 23:37.917
He brought me a bouquet
of red-orange roses.

23:37.919 --> 23:39.785
But he was so creepy,

23:39.787 --> 23:40.986
you know?

23:40.988 --> 23:42.587
I just got this bad
feeling, so when

23:42.589 --> 23:46.125
he went to the car
to get the picnic basket,

23:46.127 --> 23:48.193
I, um, I took off.

23:48.195 --> 23:50.195
Good instincts.

23:50.197 --> 23:54.198
JEANNIE:
I left the roses on the bench.

23:54.200 --> 23:56.567
And that's why he's making me
hold them, you know.

23:56.569 --> 23:57.936
It's like he's-he's forcing me

23:57.938 --> 24:00.071
to go on this date with him.

24:00.073 --> 24:01.806
I just wanted to meet somebody.

24:01.808 --> 24:04.108
I mean, I deliver flowers
to people that are in love

24:04.110 --> 24:06.077
every single day,

24:06.079 --> 24:09.879
- and then I go home by myself.
- Listen to me.

24:09.881 --> 24:12.871
AUTOMATED VOICE: Warning:
DRN charge level 47%.

24:12.884 --> 24:14.517
I promise you, tomorrow

24:14.519 --> 24:15.785
you're gonna have
a great story to tell.

24:15.787 --> 24:18.521
I've removed the casing.

24:18.523 --> 24:20.824
There's a red wire that's
running into the timer.

24:20.826 --> 24:23.593
Uh, probably a decoy.

24:23.595 --> 24:25.494
Look for the initiator.

24:29.132 --> 24:30.799
Put up the shield.

24:30.801 --> 24:34.670
Put it up and step back.

24:34.672 --> 24:36.238
Now, John.

24:38.808 --> 24:41.709
Four hands are better than two.

24:41.711 --> 24:43.511
Come on. Tell me what to do.

24:44.880 --> 24:47.482
DORIAN: Okay, Rudy said
this has to be done

24:47.484 --> 24:49.517
in a very specific order.

24:49.519 --> 24:52.053
You see these
red and yellow wires?

24:52.055 --> 24:53.754
Right. Yup.

24:53.756 --> 24:55.823
Pull them apart. Just don't
touch the white wire.

24:55.825 --> 24:57.558
Okay.

24:57.560 --> 24:59.193
Green, John!
I said don't touch green

24:59.195 --> 25:01.629
Dorian, I really need you
to be sure about this.

25:01.631 --> 25:02.630
I am, John.

25:02.632 --> 25:04.499
I need you to hold them open

25:04.501 --> 25:06.634
so I can clip the battery
in between.

25:06.636 --> 25:08.536
Okay. Just keep
still, Jeannie.

25:08.538 --> 25:10.104
Mm-hmm.

25:11.808 --> 25:13.573
Very still.

25:13.575 --> 25:14.941
DORIAN:
Almost.

25:21.983 --> 25:23.082
Clipping lead wire now.

25:29.689 --> 25:32.057
Done.

25:35.562 --> 25:37.563
There we go!
We're good.

25:37.565 --> 25:39.665
Bomb's disarmed.
We're clear.

25:39.667 --> 25:41.901
You're good.

25:41.903 --> 25:43.903
- Told ya.
- We did it!

25:43.905 --> 25:45.603
- We did it!
- Love ya, man!

25:45.605 --> 25:47.005
- Okay, okay, buddy!
- Love ya, man.

25:47.007 --> 25:49.140
- Take it down a notch.
- All right. No, no!

25:49.142 --> 25:51.676
You cannot gloss
over this moment,

25:51.678 --> 25:54.045
you understand?!
Come on! Bring it in!

25:54.047 --> 25:56.213
Bring it in!
Bring it in here!

25:56.215 --> 25:57.481
Your hair's so soft.

25:57.483 --> 25:58.616
That's good.

25:58.618 --> 26:00.884
Come on...

26:00.886 --> 26:02.553
- We survived. - Hey, hey,
you're hurting her.

26:02.555 --> 26:04.988
- We survived.
- Okay, less pressure. Aah!

26:04.990 --> 26:06.189
Okay, okay, good, good.

26:10.728 --> 26:12.062
No!

26:20.037 --> 26:21.704
MALDONADO:
Our bomber, Simon Lynch,

26:21.706 --> 26:24.040
we're working
on a current address for him.

26:24.042 --> 26:26.042
We tracked his credit cards

26:26.044 --> 26:28.644
to the delivery of some
electronic equipment.

26:28.646 --> 26:29.979
We're checking it out.

26:29.981 --> 26:32.114
This is what we got
from his dating profile.

26:34.149 --> 26:35.917
"Shy and Looking"?

26:35.919 --> 26:37.218
Yeah, shy, looking, and deadly.

26:37.220 --> 26:38.954
(laughs)

26:38.956 --> 26:40.254
Classic, Paulie!

26:40.256 --> 26:42.223
Yeah!

26:42.225 --> 26:45.560
His personality's
a little off-kilter today.

26:45.562 --> 26:47.161
A little?

26:47.163 --> 26:48.896
Yeah. Well, you should've
given him charge priority.

26:48.898 --> 26:50.497
Oh, please.

26:50.499 --> 26:51.599
Why? What happened?

26:51.601 --> 26:52.633
What does that mean?

26:54.569 --> 26:57.771
JOHN:
Nothing.

26:57.773 --> 26:59.907
Okay, let's focus.

26:59.909 --> 27:02.509
Jeannie Hartman fled the date
before it was over,

27:02.511 --> 27:05.678
went onto the forums telling
women to stay away.

27:05.680 --> 27:08.681
Ramon Medina turned Lynch down
for a loan

27:08.683 --> 27:11.183
citing him as "unstable
and unqualified."

27:11.185 --> 27:13.686
He's getting revenge on that people
that rejected him in some way.

27:13.688 --> 27:15.454
It's about control
and humiliation.

27:15.456 --> 27:18.625
It gets worse: Lynch was
accepted to the police academy.

27:18.627 --> 27:21.226
He trained on the bomb squad,
he was kicked out

27:21.228 --> 27:23.095
due to psych issues
Sergeant James Morton.

27:23.097 --> 27:24.129
We've got a protection
detail on him,

27:24.131 --> 27:25.797
and Background's flagging

27:25.799 --> 27:27.899
anyone who might have had
a conflict with Lynch.

27:27.901 --> 27:29.001
We've got his address:

27:29.003 --> 27:30.002
315 Meridian.

27:30.004 --> 27:32.037
Looks current.

27:32.039 --> 27:33.672
Paul, assemble a tactical team.

27:33.674 --> 27:34.706
Kennex, see me.

27:34.708 --> 27:36.541
DORIAN:
You heard Sandra!

27:36.543 --> 27:37.775
Roll out!
(taps table)

27:40.879 --> 27:42.647
Are you sure it's safe having
him in the field

27:42.649 --> 27:44.515
with these mood swings?

27:44.517 --> 27:46.917
Yeah, look, he's a little edgy,
but I'll keep an eye on him.

27:46.919 --> 27:47.918
He'll be okay.

28:00.196 --> 28:02.497
(indistinct background
radio communication)

28:02.499 --> 28:03.866
Hey, Dorian, why don't you
hang back?

28:03.868 --> 28:05.467
(voice slows):
Sergeant Whiskers,

28:05.469 --> 28:07.903
I'm fully capable
of doing what's necessary.

28:07.905 --> 28:12.440
But Dorian, you just... John, I am fully
capable of doing Sergeant Whiskers.

28:12.442 --> 28:14.442
Okay, listen, Dorian,
I know you're capable.

28:14.444 --> 28:16.811
I just want you to conserve
your charge, okay?

28:16.813 --> 28:19.914
(voice slows): I can't just hang
back because I have a low charge.

28:19.916 --> 28:21.916
I have a reputation
to keep, you understand?

28:21.918 --> 28:23.785
I was just starting to feel
accepted by our fellow officers.

28:23.787 --> 28:25.019
This is important to me.

28:25.021 --> 28:26.520
Boy, am I glad to see you.

28:26.522 --> 28:28.189
Never thought I'd say that,
but there it is...

28:28.191 --> 28:29.190
Don't quote me.

28:29.192 --> 28:30.757
Wish I could say the same.

28:30.759 --> 28:32.159
(voice varies in speed):
Hey, Paulie.

28:32.161 --> 28:33.960
Let's let bygones
be bygones, huh?

28:33.962 --> 28:34.995
What do you say, little man?

28:34.997 --> 28:36.897
All the windows and doors

28:36.899 --> 28:38.098
on Simon's trailer
are completely wired.

28:38.100 --> 28:39.232
It's booby-trapped.

28:39.234 --> 28:41.068
The bomb team's
gone through it.

28:41.070 --> 28:42.769
It's impossible to disarm.

28:42.771 --> 28:44.671
We need to do
a controlled detonation.

28:44.673 --> 28:46.906
And you,
no explosives for you today.

28:46.908 --> 28:48.040
(groans)

28:48.042 --> 28:49.742
Detective Kennex, CSI radioed

28:49.744 --> 28:51.376
asking for you
They found something

28:51.378 --> 28:52.578
up the road.

28:52.580 --> 28:53.512
Alright.

28:53.514 --> 28:55.014
No, no, I got this.

28:55.016 --> 28:57.516
Why don't you guys,
uh, hug it out?

29:02.655 --> 29:04.889
OFFICER:
Sir, the drone's in position.

29:04.891 --> 29:06.624
Light it up.

29:08.994 --> 29:10.461
COMPUTER VOICE.
Detonation commencing:

29:10.463 --> 29:12.463
Five, four,

29:12.465 --> 29:14.933
three, two...

29:22.473 --> 29:24.141
What do you got?

29:27.011 --> 29:28.645
Ready for the next round?

29:41.602 --> 29:44.538
And you didn't see our suspect
anywhere in the vicinity?

29:44.540 --> 29:45.049
OFFICER:
No, sir,

29:45.067 --> 29:47.582
the request for Kennex
came over the comm.

29:55.215 --> 29:56.849
Hey, Paul.

30:01.399 --> 30:04.958
His locator chip.
He could be anywhere.

30:04.960 --> 30:07.026
We're gonna get him back.

30:13.599 --> 30:15.800
I want every available drone
in pattern over that road.

30:15.802 --> 30:17.535
Do we have a description
of the vehicle?

30:17.537 --> 30:19.504
Based on the tire treads
Dorian found at the scene,

30:19.506 --> 30:20.939
it's a larger vehicle...
truck, van.

30:20.941 --> 30:24.076
Find it. And monitor
the dark net.

30:24.078 --> 30:25.810
If John is Lynch's next victim,

30:25.812 --> 30:28.780
I want to know the second
he starts broadcasting.

30:43.628 --> 30:45.963
(various indistinct
conversations)

31:11.989 --> 31:14.489
(bomb collar beeping)

31:27.570 --> 31:29.904
(phone rings)

31:37.913 --> 31:40.848
(ringing continues)

31:46.486 --> 31:47.754
Hello?

31:47.756 --> 31:49.956
Lynch, I presume.

31:49.958 --> 31:52.559
Detective Kennex,
you ready to play?

31:52.561 --> 31:54.794
Look, if you want to kill me,
Lynch, go ahead.

31:54.796 --> 31:57.530
But the people in this square
have done nothing to you.

31:57.532 --> 32:00.166
SIMON:
It's true, but you did.

32:00.168 --> 32:02.601
If there's collateral damage,
so be it.

32:02.603 --> 32:04.102
We don't have a remote
detonator.

32:04.104 --> 32:07.072
Let's go over the rules. One...

32:07.074 --> 32:10.709
if you alert anyone to the fact
that you have enough explosives

32:10.711 --> 32:12.644
under your coat
to level a building,

32:12.646 --> 32:15.480
I'll detonate the charge.

32:15.482 --> 32:19.249
Two, if the cops or the bomb
squad come close to you,

32:19.251 --> 32:22.219
I'll detonate the charge.
This time, you're on your own.

32:22.221 --> 32:26.057
Three, if the police try
to evacuate the area,

32:26.059 --> 32:27.758
I'll detonate the charge.
(laughs)

32:27.760 --> 32:29.827
Please let us evacuate
the park.

32:29.829 --> 32:31.896
Oh, my viewers
wouldn't like that.

32:31.898 --> 32:34.230
They want a good show,
and you're a big star.

32:34.232 --> 32:35.865
You're gonna help me
get my viewers back.

32:35.867 --> 32:37.266
Well, pal, it doesn't seem

32:37.268 --> 32:38.935
like you're giving me
much of a chance.

32:38.937 --> 32:41.037
I'm giving you a chance.

32:41.039 --> 32:43.039
Have a look under the bench.

32:47.612 --> 32:49.612
(children chattering
in distance)

32:55.451 --> 32:58.787
You like to disarm bombs
and save people?

32:58.789 --> 32:59.788
Like to be a big hero?

32:59.790 --> 33:01.523
(laughs)

33:01.525 --> 33:04.226
Then save yourself, "hero."

33:04.228 --> 33:06.227
The whole world's your stage.

33:08.563 --> 33:10.064
VALERIE:
Captain, Lynch is broadcasting.

33:10.066 --> 33:12.199
It's John.

33:12.201 --> 33:13.668
MALDONADO:
Can you see where they are?

33:13.670 --> 33:14.969
VALERIE:
It's the Seymour Building.

33:14.971 --> 33:16.237
He's downtown.

33:16.239 --> 33:17.805
I want Bomb Squad dispatched

33:17.807 --> 33:19.240
to the Seymour Building
immediately.

33:21.076 --> 33:22.709
SIMON: We're not so
different, <i>you and me.</i>

33:22.711 --> 33:24.077
Yeah?
Last time I checked,

33:24.079 --> 33:25.812
I wasn't a homicidal maniac.

33:25.814 --> 33:26.980
SIMON:
You forget, Detective.

33:26.982 --> 33:28.782
See, I have access
to trashed data.

33:28.784 --> 33:30.904
I went through everything
that I could find about you.

33:32.086 --> 33:33.253
I'm flattered.

33:33.255 --> 33:34.988
I know about the raid.

33:34.990 --> 33:37.257
I know that you didn't
just lose your leg.

33:37.259 --> 33:41.460
See, those men died because
of decisions you made.

33:41.462 --> 33:43.195
Yeah, maybe they did.

33:43.197 --> 33:44.897
But that doesn't
make us the same.

33:44.899 --> 33:46.532
I disagree.

33:46.534 --> 33:48.834
People didn't want you
back on the force.

33:48.836 --> 33:49.835
See, we've both

33:49.837 --> 33:51.837
had bad psych evaluations.

33:53.040 --> 33:55.473
The difference is...

33:55.475 --> 33:57.475
that <i>you</i> got a second chance.

33:59.145 --> 34:01.212
But not me.

34:01.214 --> 34:03.915
I got kicked out
of the Police Academy.

34:03.917 --> 34:05.950
That black mark has
followed me forever.

34:05.952 --> 34:07.552
That's why I couldn't
open the bar.

34:07.554 --> 34:08.753
That's why
I couldn't get a loan.

34:08.755 --> 34:09.786
(chuckling):
I feel for you, pal.

34:09.789 --> 34:11.188
I mean, where is a psychopath

34:11.190 --> 34:12.723
to get a bank loan

34:12.725 --> 34:14.692
these days?

34:23.068 --> 34:25.868
I said "no cops"!

34:25.870 --> 34:27.036
Hey, easy, Lynch.

34:27.038 --> 34:29.105
I got fans that
want to get close.

34:30.940 --> 34:32.741
If they evacuate,
I'm blowing you and them

34:32.743 --> 34:33.809
to hell right now.

34:33.811 --> 34:35.043
Paul, stand down.

34:35.045 --> 34:36.543
He knows you're there.

34:36.545 --> 34:38.880
We can't risk
civilian casualties.

34:38.882 --> 34:40.514
How does he know?

34:40.516 --> 34:41.750
They're not in line-of-sight
of the cameras.

34:41.752 --> 34:43.719
He's here.

34:43.721 --> 34:44.719
He's watching.

34:46.723 --> 34:48.655
He needs a vantage point.

34:51.893 --> 34:53.493
DORIAN:
There.

34:53.495 --> 34:56.496
The clock tower.

34:56.498 --> 34:58.833
Suspect is on site.

34:58.835 --> 35:00.601
Copy that.
Have a sniper take position.

35:00.603 --> 35:01.836
He's in the clock tower.

35:01.838 --> 35:03.437
Get yourself ready
to take a shot.

35:11.178 --> 35:13.179
Oops. That was bad luck.

35:13.181 --> 35:15.181
What are you going to do now?

35:25.892 --> 35:27.525
He's holding something.

35:29.129 --> 35:30.896
VALERIE:
It's a dead man's switch.

35:30.898 --> 35:32.131
If we kill Lynch, he'll let go

35:32.133 --> 35:33.133
and the bomb will explode.

35:33.134 --> 35:34.133
Call off the shot

35:34.135 --> 35:35.200
immediately.

35:35.202 --> 35:37.608
PAUL:
You heard her. Stand down.

35:50.098 --> 35:51.832
(bomb collar beeping)

36:10.317 --> 36:12.150
SIMON:
Ah, trying to get the token.

36:12.152 --> 36:14.352
You think that you can use it
to separate the wires.

36:17.857 --> 36:19.191
You better hurry.

36:19.193 --> 36:20.425
People are getting excited.

36:20.427 --> 36:22.694
They want me to blow you up.

36:22.696 --> 36:24.162
(straining):
Yeah...

36:24.164 --> 36:26.098
I'm getting kind of
excited myself.

36:26.100 --> 36:28.099
(grunting)

36:33.671 --> 36:36.173
Yeah, well,
these people don't care

36:36.175 --> 36:38.675
if you blow me up
or if you kill yourself.

36:38.677 --> 36:40.144
They just want a show.

36:40.146 --> 36:41.345
Those are bold words,

36:41.347 --> 36:42.746
considering
I can obliterate you

36:42.748 --> 36:44.814
and everyone around you.

36:46.483 --> 36:48.818
Well, that wouldn't be fair,
now would it?

36:48.820 --> 36:50.820
You wanted me to play.

36:53.624 --> 36:56.259
Or are you going to rig it
so I can't win,

36:56.261 --> 36:57.526
like you did with Ramon?

36:57.528 --> 36:58.794
PAUL:
Lynch's positioned himself

36:58.796 --> 37:00.796
so he has a view
in all directions.

37:00.798 --> 37:03.232
If we approach the tower,
he'll see us coming.

37:03.234 --> 37:05.333
I've calculated a path
to evade his cameras.

37:05.335 --> 37:07.069
I can climb it.

37:07.071 --> 37:08.137
And then what?

37:08.139 --> 37:09.738
Once I get to the top,

37:09.740 --> 37:11.606
I'll transfer
an electrical charge.

37:11.608 --> 37:13.308
His muscles will tense...

37:13.310 --> 37:15.076
...and he won't be able
to let go of the trigger.

37:15.078 --> 37:17.078
Smart. Do you have
the charge left?

37:17.080 --> 37:18.479
(beeping)

37:18.481 --> 37:20.481
AUTOMATED VOICE:
Warning: DRN charge level 15%.

37:22.117 --> 37:23.684
I have enough.

37:23.686 --> 37:24.852
Okay. Go.

37:33.761 --> 37:35.762
Can you do that?

37:43.704 --> 37:46.673
SIMON: My black marks just kept
following me around.

37:46.675 --> 37:48.774
See, people should've
respected me

37:48.776 --> 37:50.509
like they do now.

37:51.678 --> 37:52.812
That doesn't give you the right

37:52.814 --> 37:54.680
to kill people, though, does it?

37:54.682 --> 37:56.215
Tell me you never
killed anybody.

37:56.217 --> 37:57.449
Hey, buddy, I'm a cop.

37:57.451 --> 37:59.484
That's part of the job,
sometimes.

37:59.486 --> 38:01.486
You hide behind a uniform.

38:01.488 --> 38:02.821
Y... you...
you don't understand!

38:02.823 --> 38:05.056
Justice is justice!

38:05.058 --> 38:07.458
Is that what this is?

38:13.699 --> 38:15.466
AUTOMATED VOICE:
DRN charge level 11%.

38:26.410 --> 38:28.178
DRN charge level 10%.

38:35.052 --> 38:37.053
(sighs)

38:46.096 --> 38:47.363
AUTOMATED VOICE:
Warning:

38:47.365 --> 38:49.598
DRN charge level 8%.

39:10.785 --> 39:13.320
(alarm beeping)

39:18.459 --> 39:20.694
(inhales)

39:27.734 --> 39:30.136
Game over, Detective.

39:40.179 --> 39:41.313
(grunts)

39:42.681 --> 39:44.283
(grunts)

39:50.323 --> 39:52.824
DORIAN:
Suspect... is secure.

39:58.363 --> 40:00.364
(panting)

40:04.202 --> 40:06.203
(laughs)

40:09.241 --> 40:10.841
(laughs)

40:10.843 --> 40:12.842
(laughing louder)

40:20.418 --> 40:21.717
What are we drinking to?

40:21.719 --> 40:23.719
Winning.

40:23.721 --> 40:24.720
Here's to winning.

40:28.158 --> 40:29.658
How's Dorian?

40:29.660 --> 40:31.860
Yeah, he's recharging.

40:31.862 --> 40:33.795
You know, I gotta admit,

40:33.797 --> 40:35.130
I'm gonna miss
his little outbursts.

40:35.132 --> 40:36.298
They were kind of hilarious.

40:36.300 --> 40:38.167
Hmm, yeah.
Tell me about it.

40:38.169 --> 40:40.402
What did the doctors
say about Lynch?

40:40.404 --> 40:42.804
Severe electrical burns,
but he'll live.

40:42.806 --> 40:44.605
At least the trial
will be open and shut.

40:44.607 --> 40:45.739
Yeah, well, we got
at least 1,000 witnesses

40:45.741 --> 40:47.475
to put on the stand.

40:47.477 --> 40:49.517
Yeah, not sure I'd like to
be in the room with them.

40:50.712 --> 40:51.712
You know,

40:51.714 --> 40:54.182
as crazy as that guy was,

40:54.184 --> 40:56.084
he was right about one thing:

40:56.086 --> 40:58.386
Black marks,
they do follow you around.

40:58.388 --> 41:00.854
You know, sometimes I walk
through this precinct,

41:00.856 --> 41:02.856
and the way people
look at me, like...

41:05.126 --> 41:07.260
John, don't let him
into your head.

41:08.596 --> 41:10.530
You've done nothing
but a great job

41:10.532 --> 41:12.099
since you've been back.

41:12.101 --> 41:14.334
Well, I got you
to thank for that.

41:14.336 --> 41:16.668
If you hadn't ignored
that psych report...

41:16.670 --> 41:19.405
There was a psych report?

41:22.209 --> 41:24.343
I got a favor to ask you.

41:24.345 --> 41:26.112
Hmm.

41:28.181 --> 41:29.515
What are we doing here?

41:29.517 --> 41:31.182
Taking care of your
charging problem.

41:31.184 --> 41:32.283
I don't have
a charging problem,

41:32.285 --> 41:34.685
I fully charged at the station.

41:34.687 --> 41:36.121
JOHN: That's not what I meant.

41:36.123 --> 41:37.489
Hey, here he is!

41:37.491 --> 41:38.823
This is going to be great!

41:38.825 --> 41:39.823
DORIAN:
What?

41:39.825 --> 41:41.558
What's gonna be great?

41:41.560 --> 41:43.660
Would you say
peanut butter and jelly

41:43.662 --> 41:46.397
- are just two foods?
- They are.

41:46.399 --> 41:48.399
- They're... they're two foods.
- No, it's a sandwich,

41:48.401 --> 41:50.100
isn't it?
That's what I'm saying.

41:50.102 --> 41:51.368
Is when they're together...

41:51.370 --> 41:52.736
What I'm saying is:
who's ready for

41:52.738 --> 41:54.171
some crazy nights
out on the town?

41:54.173 --> 41:55.505
Me.

41:55.507 --> 41:56.506
You coming?

41:56.508 --> 41:58.107
We can take photos.

41:58.109 --> 41:59.675
Hang 'em up on the walls.

41:59.677 --> 42:01.610
We can meet women, we can invite
the women back here.

42:01.612 --> 42:03.379
You could even talk
to the women for me.

42:03.381 --> 42:08.384
No... obviously, your women
are yours, definitely.

42:08.386 --> 42:11.186
Did you talk to
Captain Maldonado?

42:11.188 --> 42:13.355
You wanted out.
I got you out.

42:13.357 --> 42:16.258
(mumbling): This is not
what I had in mind, John.

42:16.260 --> 42:18.160
- What? - So, what's
the plans, roomie?

42:18.162 --> 42:19.627
I thought maybe we'd
have a quiet one tonight.

42:19.629 --> 42:20.862
Checkers? Chess?

42:20.864 --> 42:22.864
I'm a very particular person.

42:22.866 --> 42:25.100
What happens in the lab
must stay in the lab.

42:25.102 --> 42:27.890
I have some sleeping issues. Have
you ever heard of night terrors?

42:27.908 --> 42:29.392
<font color="#40bfff">Sync & corrections by</font> <font color="#FFA500">wilson0804</font>
<font color="#40bfff">www.Addic7ed.com</font>

43:20.486 --> 43:23.020
I have some sleeping issues. Have
you ever heard ? of night terrors?

43:23.054 --> 43:28.326
Apollo 13, the 1970 moon shot
that became a dramatic fight for

43:28.360 --> 43:32.496
survival, a story more
remarkable than Hollywood would

43:32.530 --> 43:34.498
ever dare to invent.

43:34.532 --> 43:36.852
The more I learned about the
mission, the more I learned

43:41.305 --> 43:47.659
