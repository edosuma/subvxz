WEBVTT

00:01.768 --> 00:03.609
Previously on Madam Secretary:

00:03.610 --> 00:05.101
One truckload of spent fuel rods

00:05.102 --> 00:06.638
stolen by Moldovan thugs

00:06.639 --> 00:09.558
with no expertise in handling the material

00:09.559 --> 00:12.478
is hardly what I would
deem a priority situation.

00:12.479 --> 00:14.808
If the uranium comes with
its own nuclear physicist

00:14.809 --> 00:16.478
to show 'em how to use it...

00:16.479 --> 00:18.348
I'd call that getting the
most bang for your buck.

00:18.349 --> 00:21.098
Mom is hosting a conference this
week featuring Noura Al-Kitabi.

00:21.099 --> 00:22.348
I think we should all go.

00:22.349 --> 00:24.388
Isn't that the girl who got acid attacked?

00:24.389 --> 00:26.848
In Saudi Arabia, we
learned that Hizb Al-Shahid

00:26.849 --> 00:29.638
is targeting the family
of Noura Al-Kitabi.

00:29.639 --> 00:31.558
Now you're telling me
that that's the same group

00:31.559 --> 00:32.888
that was trying to buy the uranium?

00:32.889 --> 00:35.268
The conference... shut it down. Now.

00:36.455 --> 00:37.638
Ma'am!

00:37.639 --> 00:39.888
This way, everybody. We need to get out.

00:39.889 --> 00:42.699
Allahu Akbar!

00:43.809 --> 00:45.308
No.

00:45.309 --> 00:47.231
Come on.

00:47.232 --> 00:50.699
Please pick up. Pick up.

00:52.189 --> 00:55.808
Come on, come on, pick up, pick up, please.

00:55.809 --> 00:57.888
Hey, it's Stevie. You can leave a message,

00:57.889 --> 00:59.972
- but you really should be texting me.
- Oh, damn it.

00:59.973 --> 01:01.764
Stevie, listen, as soon as you get this

01:01.765 --> 01:04.950
I need you to call me
back, baby, okay? Really...

01:04.950 --> 01:05.746
I need you to call me back

01:05.747 --> 01:08.288
and let me know that
you guys are okay, okay?

01:08.289 --> 01:10.535
It's Ali. And you have the talking stick.

01:10.536 --> 01:11.389
Leave a message at the beep.

01:11.390 --> 01:13.070
Why can I not get in touch with my family?

01:14.496 --> 01:15.915
Oh, for God's sake, now what?

01:15.916 --> 01:17.205
The network keeps crashing.

01:17.206 --> 01:19.995
Wh...

01:19.996 --> 01:21.590
Turn around. We're gonna go
to St. Anne's in Virginia.

01:21.591 --> 01:22.883
Negative, ma'am. We're

01:22.884 --> 01:24.881
under strict protocol to get
you to the White House bunker.

01:24.882 --> 01:26.833
No, no, I don't care.
Just turn around, now.

01:26.834 --> 01:28.245
I'm sorry, ma'am. Not your call.

01:28.246 --> 01:29.785
There could be a secondary attack.

01:29.786 --> 01:32.067
- Do you really think that might happen?
- It did on 9/11.

01:33.246 --> 01:34.955
Whoa, whoa. Uh, Nadine.

01:34.956 --> 01:36.458
- You keep trying, okay?
- Yeah.

01:40.496 --> 01:42.285
Nadine, what is it? What do you have?

01:42.286 --> 01:45.495
Uh, we're getting reports
of dozens of severe injuries.

01:45.496 --> 01:47.075
Uh, but no details yet.

01:47.076 --> 01:49.785
We're putting all of our
foreign outposts on high alert.

01:49.786 --> 01:51.535
No, no, no, forget high alerts, okay?

01:51.536 --> 01:54.535
I want every embassy and
consulate on lockdown.

01:54.536 --> 01:55.536
Yes, ma'am.

01:55.537 --> 01:56.745
Hey, hey, wait.

01:56.746 --> 01:58.165
Don't go anywhere. Stay there, stay there.

01:58.166 --> 01:59.205
I got to call you back.

01:59.206 --> 02:00.581
Jason.

02:00.582 --> 02:01.955
Jason.

02:01.956 --> 02:04.375
Hey, baby. How are you?

02:04.376 --> 02:05.705
We just went through triage.

02:05.706 --> 02:07.375
They're saying the bomb is radioactive.

02:07.376 --> 02:09.285
Do you feel sick?

02:09.286 --> 02:10.495
Do your sisters?

02:10.496 --> 02:12.535
No, no, we all tested negative.

02:12.536 --> 02:13.806
Dad got us out in time.

02:13.807 --> 02:15.075
Okay.

02:15.076 --> 02:18.455
It's bad, Mom. I mean, we've
seen people with, like...

02:18.456 --> 02:20.495
there's a lot of blood.

02:20.496 --> 02:22.785
I know. Listen, deep breaths.

02:22.786 --> 02:26.455
Listen, baby, I got to go to
the White House for a little bit

02:26.456 --> 02:29.665
and then I'm gonna get to you
as soon as I can, all right?

02:29.666 --> 02:33.165
You just... put Dad on the phone, okay?

02:33.166 --> 02:36.516
Mom, Dad went back inside.

02:38.166 --> 02:39.271
What do you mean?

02:39.272 --> 02:40.375
After the bomb went off.

02:40.376 --> 02:42.415
I don't know, he wanted to help.

02:43.851 --> 02:45.951
Where is he now?

02:47.000 --> 02:53.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:57.436 --> 02:58.265
Pull up, please.

02:58.266 --> 02:59.495
How is she?

02:59.496 --> 03:01.246
- Who?
- How's that woman?

03:01.247 --> 03:02.745
The woman I was helping. She was wearing

03:02.746 --> 03:04.418
- the orange dress.
- Lots of injured, sir.

03:04.419 --> 03:05.835
You feeling any dizziness, nausea?

03:05.836 --> 03:08.665
Uh, no, I'm fine. I just
need to call my wife.

03:08.666 --> 03:09.915
Sample is positive.

03:09.916 --> 03:12.375
How long were you at ground zero?

03:12.376 --> 03:14.705
Uh, I don't know... seven, ten minutes.

03:14.706 --> 03:16.666
- Look at this.
- What is that?

03:16.667 --> 03:18.179
- He's deteriorating. Hazmat Five,
- What is that?!

03:18.180 --> 03:21.075
dispatch. Patient
two-niner is now Level One.

03:21.076 --> 03:23.535
Radiation burns on both
hands, probable lung exposure.

03:23.536 --> 03:25.035
I need to call my wife.

03:25.036 --> 03:27.360
- Sir. Sir, it's contaminated, sir.
- I need to call her right now!

03:27.361 --> 03:28.835
It's contaminated, sir!

03:28.836 --> 03:31.075
Lay back.

03:37.916 --> 03:39.915
Come on, Henry,

03:39.916 --> 03:41.175
come on.

03:42.436 --> 03:44.285
- Can you get down to St. Anne's?
- Yes.

03:44.286 --> 03:45.578
- Find out whatever you can and...
- Yeah, yeah.

03:45.579 --> 03:47.126
- take my security detail with you.
- Yes, ma'am.

03:47.127 --> 03:49.251
POTUS just activated the
National Response Plan.

03:49.252 --> 03:50.335
The Guard's mobilizing, including

03:50.336 --> 03:53.835
the 260th regiment and
the WMD civil support team.

03:53.836 --> 03:55.625
Any sign of secondary attack?

03:55.626 --> 03:58.745
Not yet. But protocol
demands we shelter in place.

03:58.746 --> 04:00.165
You hear from Henry?

04:00.166 --> 04:01.375
Do you know anything?

04:01.376 --> 04:03.575
EMTs found him at ground zero.

04:03.576 --> 04:05.665
He's on his way to St.
Anne's with the others.

04:05.666 --> 04:07.745
Hey, hey.

04:07.746 --> 04:09.245
Our Hazmat teams...

04:09.246 --> 04:11.346
they're the best in the world.

04:13.576 --> 04:14.915
You need a minute?

04:14.916 --> 04:16.665
No, I don't.

04:16.666 --> 04:18.415
Metro police confirm a complete shutdown.

04:18.416 --> 04:19.915
All airports and roads are now closed.

04:19.916 --> 04:21.875
Our NIRT Team is putting
a perimeter in place.

04:21.875 --> 04:24.165
Exclusion zone will be
a one-kilometer radius

04:24.166 --> 04:26.038
- in Northern Virginia.
- What about airspace?

04:26.039 --> 04:28.075
F-16s are scrambling
out of Andrews now, sir.

04:28.076 --> 04:29.705
They'll be in combat
formation over the district

04:29.706 --> 04:30.955
in less than two minutes.

04:30.956 --> 04:33.495
Preliminary readings
indicate that the device

04:33.496 --> 04:35.705
was composed of C-4 and packed with

04:35.706 --> 04:37.705
fuel grade uranium.

04:37.706 --> 04:40.075
Fuel grade? Wait, isn't that the same type

04:40.076 --> 04:41.575
that was stolen in Moldova?

04:41.576 --> 04:43.165
But obviously from a different source.

04:43.166 --> 04:44.705
My boys secured that shipment.

04:44.706 --> 04:46.375
I have an update on casualties.

04:46.376 --> 04:48.705
43 wounded, ten critical.

04:48.706 --> 04:50.415
That's just from the blast.

04:50.416 --> 04:52.165
About 100 others are being evaluated

04:52.166 --> 04:53.705
for radiation poisoning.

04:53.706 --> 04:55.625
Could have been much worse
if Elizabeth hadn't ordered

04:55.626 --> 04:57.285
the evacuation of the building.

04:57.286 --> 04:59.375
Our biggest problem now is panic.

04:59.376 --> 05:01.205
Dirty bombs are technically
classified as WMDs,

05:01.206 --> 05:02.625
but they're really more like...

05:02.626 --> 05:04.665
Weapons of mass disruption. I'm aware.

05:04.666 --> 05:07.495
Terrorists just bombed
an American university.

05:07.496 --> 05:10.375
I'd say that's a little
more than a disruption.

05:10.376 --> 05:12.835
She's right, sir. We can't minimize this.

05:12.836 --> 05:14.245
How bad is the radiation?

05:14.246 --> 05:15.535
Don't know yet.

05:15.536 --> 05:17.575
We got an ID on the bomber.

05:17.576 --> 05:21.455
Linda Peavy, age 22.

05:21.456 --> 05:23.035
NSA got into her Twitter feed.

05:23.036 --> 05:25.205
Has Hizb Al-Shahid's
fingerprints all over it.

05:25.206 --> 05:26.745
Was she on anybody's radar?

05:26.746 --> 05:28.785
No, ma'am. Apparently she was radicalized

05:28.786 --> 05:30.785
several months ago, but
didn't act until now.

05:30.786 --> 05:32.665
A sleeper cell of one.

05:32.666 --> 05:34.125
That's a chilling thought.

05:34.126 --> 05:35.455
Who gave her the uranium?

05:35.456 --> 05:37.075
Unknown. But the man

05:37.076 --> 05:40.535
ultimately responsible is Jibral Disah.

05:40.536 --> 05:42.835
He recently emerged as the De facto leader

05:42.836 --> 05:44.035
of the organization.

05:44.036 --> 05:45.081
And where is he?

05:45.082 --> 05:46.125
Libya.

05:46.126 --> 05:47.375
Care to elaborate?

05:47.376 --> 05:50.035
I wish we could. HS is a new group.

05:50.036 --> 05:52.785
Information about its leadership
and whereabouts are slim.

05:52.786 --> 05:54.835
17 intelligence agencies,

05:54.836 --> 05:56.835
almost a million employees,

05:56.836 --> 05:58.625
and this is the best we have?

05:58.626 --> 06:00.575
Yes, Mr. President. I'm afraid so.

06:00.576 --> 06:01.383
So what's your plan?

06:01.384 --> 06:02.513
We follow the uranium.

06:02.514 --> 06:04.513
If we can trace the pathway to the bomb,

06:04.514 --> 06:05.673
it might lead us to Disah.

06:05.674 --> 06:07.093
Well, get into it with everything you have.

06:07.094 --> 06:08.513
I want answers, and fast.

06:08.514 --> 06:10.984
The longer we take to
respond, the weaker we become.

06:17.714 --> 06:18.883
Did you get that statement?

06:18.884 --> 06:20.963
Just sent it.

06:20.964 --> 06:22.213
Oh, my God,

06:22.214 --> 06:23.673
is that your...

06:23.674 --> 06:27.343
Neighborhood? Yeah. We're
right inside the exclusion zone.

06:27.344 --> 06:31.234
So much for living in a quiet college town.

06:32.673 --> 06:34.132
You hear about Laura Vargas?

06:34.134 --> 06:35.383
Is she hurt?

06:35.384 --> 06:36.753
Shrapnel.

06:36.754 --> 06:37.674
She's in surgery now.

06:37.675 --> 06:39.713
Well, what about Dr. McCord? Any update?

06:39.714 --> 06:41.963
Blake is on his way over to St. Anne's.

06:41.964 --> 06:43.154
There's no word yet.

06:44.423 --> 06:46.693
How is the secretary
even supposed to function?

06:48.753 --> 06:51.382
Okay. I know this is...

06:51.384 --> 06:52.963
overwhelming.

06:52.964 --> 06:55.303
But right now, we need

06:55.304 --> 06:57.303
to roll up our sleeves

06:57.304 --> 06:58.713
and stay focused.

06:58.714 --> 07:01.253
We can start by figuring out

07:01.254 --> 07:03.343
where that uranium came from.

07:03.344 --> 07:05.593
We know it wasn't domestic.

07:05.594 --> 07:07.383
Right, it's all tightly controlled.

07:07.384 --> 07:08.673
So its was smuggled in.

07:08.674 --> 07:10.114
How?

07:10.115 --> 07:11.553
Well, there are multiple vectors,

07:11.554 --> 07:13.053
all depending on point of origin.

07:13.054 --> 07:14.843
I can get into it with Energy and DHS,

07:14.844 --> 07:17.633
but it's... it's a scary long list.

07:17.634 --> 07:19.056
- We can divvy it up.
- It's the secretary.

07:19.057 --> 07:21.923
Oh. Uh, Madam Secretary.

07:21.924 --> 07:23.213
Hey, is everybody there?

07:23.214 --> 07:24.553
Yes, ma'am.

07:24.554 --> 07:26.423
We heard about Henry.

07:26.424 --> 07:27.753
We're all pulling for him.

07:27.754 --> 07:30.673
Thank you. Um...

07:30.674 --> 07:33.093
look, I-I know that we ruled out Moldova.

07:33.094 --> 07:34.803
As the source of the uranium?

07:34.804 --> 07:36.803
Yes, ma'am. CIA thinks that...

07:36.804 --> 07:39.093
Thinks they're infallible, got it.

07:39.094 --> 07:41.013
But what if CIA is wrong?

07:41.014 --> 07:43.633
I mean, could Hizb Al-Shahid

07:43.634 --> 07:45.803
have brought the uranium

07:45.804 --> 07:46.923
here in time?

07:46.924 --> 07:48.883
I'm...

07:48.884 --> 07:49.754
not sure that...

07:49.755 --> 07:51.314
Humor me.

07:52.674 --> 07:55.093
Considering the time elapsed

07:55.094 --> 07:57.383
between the theft

07:57.384 --> 07:59.803
and, uh, the detonation?

07:59.804 --> 08:01.133
Yes.

08:01.134 --> 08:04.614
It's theoretically possible.

08:07.924 --> 08:09.253
Excuse me, excuse me.

08:09.254 --> 08:10.923
Move, move, move, move, move.

08:10.924 --> 08:12.173
Uh, coming through, coming through.

08:12.174 --> 08:14.383
State department. Thanks.

08:14.384 --> 08:16.923
McCords. Hi. Do you have
information about a...

08:27.134 --> 08:29.633
Excuse me. McCords? McCord? No.

08:29.634 --> 08:31.303
One squeeze every half minute, okay?

08:31.304 --> 08:32.844
- Thank you.
- Oh, McCord children.

08:32.845 --> 08:34.145
Thank God. You guys all right?

08:35.254 --> 08:37.306
- Where's... where-where's your dad?
- No clue.

08:37.307 --> 08:38.251
We've been trying to find out,

08:38.253 --> 08:39.753
but nobody will tell us anything.

08:39.754 --> 08:42.013
Um...

08:42.014 --> 08:43.484
All right, wait here, okay?

08:46.344 --> 08:49.013
Hey, excuse me, ma'am, uh,

08:49.014 --> 08:51.713
I need information about
a patient. A Henry McCord.

08:51.714 --> 08:53.676
- McCord.
- McCord. McCord. I don't have him.

08:53.677 --> 08:55.173
Uh, McCord? He's in the HIU.

08:55.174 --> 08:56.553
What does that mean?

08:56.554 --> 08:57.883
Uh, biocontainment. It means

08:57.884 --> 09:00.404
he's critical. Uh, I'm sorry.

09:05.384 --> 09:07.133
The records were falsified.

09:07.134 --> 09:08.944
What are you talking about?

09:09.964 --> 09:10.964
The manifest

09:10.965 --> 09:13.423
for the truck in Moldova

09:13.424 --> 09:15.713
was a fiction, perpetrated

09:15.714 --> 09:17.923
by the same corrupt inspector

09:17.924 --> 09:19.513
who arranged the theft.

09:19.514 --> 09:21.253
How the hell did we miss that?

09:21.254 --> 09:24.423
Well, apparently CIA took
the stats at face value.

09:24.424 --> 09:27.053
How much uranium is missing?

09:27.054 --> 09:29.343
Eight kilograms. Enough for

09:29.344 --> 09:31.673
up to three additional bombs.

09:31.674 --> 09:32.963
Which, for all we know,

09:32.964 --> 09:34.239
are already here.

09:34.240 --> 09:35.513
At least tell me

09:35.514 --> 09:37.756
- we have some targeting data.
- No, sir. Not yet.

09:37.757 --> 09:41.024
Madam Secretary, I have
Blake Moran for you.

09:43.134 --> 09:44.963
Talk to me, Blake.

09:44.964 --> 09:47.385
Uh, I'm with Dr. Cary,
who did Henry's triage.

09:47.386 --> 09:49.844
Uh, here she is. Secretary of state.

09:49.845 --> 09:52.264
Ma'am, your husband is expressing symptoms

09:52.265 --> 09:53.514
of radiation poisoning.

09:53.515 --> 09:55.354
Beta burns, nausea, vomiting.

09:55.355 --> 09:56.425
Is he gonna be okay?

09:56.426 --> 09:58.925
We won't know for a few
hours. We're taking bioassays

09:58.926 --> 10:01.475
for estimations. It all
depends on the initial exposure.

10:01.476 --> 10:03.264
Okay, I want-I want to talk to him.

10:03.265 --> 10:04.424
That's not possible.

10:04.425 --> 10:06.175
We're administering DTPA

10:06.176 --> 10:09.214
and a prophylactic dose of Prussian blue.

10:09.215 --> 10:10.474
Uh, Prussian... That's-that's, uh,

10:10.475 --> 10:12.554
it chelates heavy metals, right?

10:12.555 --> 10:15.554
That's right. Uh, but the
medication is only effective

10:15.555 --> 10:16.924
if his exposure was limited.

10:16.925 --> 10:18.424
What if it wasn't?

10:18.425 --> 10:20.474
We'll try to keep him as
comfortable as possible,

10:20.475 --> 10:22.575
but there's nothing else we can do.

Bess.

10:48.835 --> 10:50.664
How's Henry?

10:50.665 --> 10:53.834
They're running tests.

10:53.835 --> 10:56.592
I know we have the
shelter in place protocol,

10:56.593 --> 10:58.012
but I can make an exception.

10:58.013 --> 11:00.540
Deputy Cushing can ride shotgun
until you're ready to come back.

11:00.541 --> 11:01.630
Sir, we need you.

11:01.631 --> 11:04.141
Henry would never forgive me if I left now.

11:08.541 --> 11:10.001
What is it?

11:10.002 --> 11:11.460
We caught a break.

11:11.461 --> 11:14.053
This is security footage of Linda Peavy

11:14.054 --> 11:16.904
outside a coffee shop five
blocks from the conference.

11:23.053 --> 11:24.392
It's a dead drop.

11:24.393 --> 11:26.392
The dirty bomb is in that backpack.

11:26.393 --> 11:28.972
And this is the man who left it

11:28.973 --> 11:32.512
for her ten minutes earlier.

11:32.513 --> 11:33.842
Do we know who he is?

11:33.843 --> 11:35.682
Facial recognition identified him

11:35.683 --> 11:38.342
as Munthir Tuwala, an agricultural attaché

11:38.343 --> 11:40.613
at the Saudi Arabian Embassy.

11:41.803 --> 11:43.762
A Saudi diplomat did this?

11:43.763 --> 11:45.524
Tuwala entered the United States by car

11:45.525 --> 11:47.904
early yesterday morning
from Quebec after a flight

11:47.905 --> 11:49.484
to Montreal from Bucharest.

11:49.485 --> 11:51.167
Which is only about

11:51.168 --> 11:52.972
200 miles from the Moldovan border.

11:52.973 --> 11:55.721
Our working theory is he was
able to use his diplomatic pouch

11:55.722 --> 11:57.768
to smuggle the nuclear
material into the country.

11:57.769 --> 11:58.514
Son of a bitch

11:58.515 --> 12:00.851
could be the key to finding Disah in Libya.

12:00.852 --> 12:02.724
- Where's Tuwala now?
- At work,

12:02.725 --> 12:05.221
at the Saudi Embassy
on New Hampshire Avenue.

12:05.222 --> 12:07.702
Where we have no jurisdiction.

12:09.682 --> 12:13.011
Marguerite, deploy an FBI
tac team to the embassy.

12:13.012 --> 12:15.108
General Kohl, I want the
National Guard providing backup.

12:15.109 --> 12:16.360
- Right away.
- Yes, sir.

12:16.361 --> 12:18.101
Bess, summon the Saudi ambassador.

12:18.102 --> 12:19.572
Yes, sir, right away.

12:25.892 --> 12:27.891
Madam Secretary, it's Henry.

12:27.892 --> 12:29.101
Oh, please.

12:29.102 --> 12:30.431
Baby?

12:30.432 --> 12:32.061
Hey.

12:32.062 --> 12:34.351
Uh, hey, they finally
gave me my phone call.

12:34.352 --> 12:37.261
Oh, my God, it is so
good to hear your voice.

12:37.262 --> 12:38.721
How are you feeling?

12:38.722 --> 12:40.301
I'm a little woozy.

12:40.302 --> 12:42.931
The worst part is this Prussian blue stuff

12:42.932 --> 12:45.011
they have me on. It tastes like paint.

12:45.012 --> 12:46.761
Well, because it-it is.

12:46.762 --> 12:50.181
I mean, literally made
from paint. I looked it up.

12:50.182 --> 12:52.891
Okay, you didn't have to tell me that.

12:52.892 --> 12:54.391
You're one to talk, Mr. Fun Fact.

12:54.392 --> 12:56.221
Baby, I want to be with you so much.

12:56.222 --> 12:57.931
You can't, without

12:57.932 --> 13:00.351
a Hazmat suit. Honestly, babe,
that's not a good look on you.

13:00.352 --> 13:03.221
Listen, right now your
place is with the president.

13:03.222 --> 13:04.801
Uh-oh.

13:04.802 --> 13:07.638
Okay, listen. I got to go.

13:08.852 --> 13:10.935
They're about to do some more
medical experiments on me.

13:10.936 --> 13:13.641
Okay. Okay, I'm gonna get
there as soon as I can.

13:13.642 --> 13:15.452
I love you so...

13:17.302 --> 13:19.242
I love you too.

13:27.142 --> 13:30.561
Madam Secretary, I'm as
horrified by this as you are.

13:30.562 --> 13:32.431
Good.

13:32.432 --> 13:34.681
Because the FBI is gonna be at your embassy

13:34.682 --> 13:37.101
to pick up Mr. Tuwala in five minutes.

13:37.102 --> 13:39.681
I understand your urgency,
but inside our embassy gates,

13:39.682 --> 13:42.641
Munthir Tuwala is on sovereign Saudi soil.

13:42.642 --> 13:44.221
I have no authority to hand him to you,

13:44.222 --> 13:46.301
not without official proceedings.

13:46.302 --> 13:49.561
Well, you can't seriously think
that we're gonna sit around

13:49.562 --> 13:52.061
and wait for you to talk about it?

13:52.062 --> 13:53.931
You must respect our process.

13:53.932 --> 13:56.511
You're harboring the known perpetrator

13:56.512 --> 13:59.261
of a terrorist attack.

13:59.262 --> 14:00.931
So let me lay out our process:

14:00.932 --> 14:03.108
you're gonna open your
gates and hand over Tuwala,

14:03.109 --> 14:04.277
or we're gonna break them down.

14:04.278 --> 14:07.151
Madam Secretary, that
would be an act of war.

14:07.152 --> 14:09.922
It sure would be.

14:15.112 --> 14:17.792
You have four minutes.

14:29.322 --> 14:31.151
This is your last chance to surrender

14:31.152 --> 14:33.111
Munthir Tuwala!

14:33.112 --> 14:34.910
You have to wait.

14:34.911 --> 14:36.399
We must have permission from the king.

14:36.400 --> 14:37.450
We have our orders.

14:37.451 --> 14:40.177
You cannot enter. We will resist.

14:47.294 --> 14:48.833
Open the gates now.

14:48.834 --> 14:50.086
- Up there!
- On the roof!

14:50.087 --> 14:51.463
Someone get on the roof!

14:51.464 --> 14:52.623
Freeze!

14:52.624 --> 14:54.123
It's Tuwala!

14:54.124 --> 14:55.224
Someone stop him!

14:57.374 --> 14:59.144
We need him alive!

15:00.334 --> 15:01.814
Don't let him jump!

15:03.294 --> 15:04.753
Don't jump!

15:04.754 --> 15:06.854
Don't do it!

15:18.011 --> 15:19.958
With Tuwala dead, the Saudis are being

15:19.959 --> 15:23.167
much more cooperative.
Ambassador Asim has assured me

15:23.168 --> 15:26.586
that their entire government
is behind our investigation.

15:26.587 --> 15:28.996
All it took was a diplomatic
terrorist face-planting

15:28.997 --> 15:30.826
on New Hampshire Avenue.

15:30.827 --> 15:32.416
Where are we, Ephraim?

15:32.417 --> 15:34.956
Moving into position outside
Munthir Tuwala's apartment

15:34.957 --> 15:36.376
here in DC.

15:36.377 --> 15:38.376
Sir, we have an update on the uranium.

15:38.377 --> 15:39.299
What is it?

15:39.300 --> 15:42.379
My team found a lead-lined
canister in a dumpster

15:42.380 --> 15:44.299
near the embassy. It tested positive

15:44.300 --> 15:46.379
for the same radioisotope signature

15:46.380 --> 15:48.299
as the uranium used in the bomb.

15:48.300 --> 15:50.839
Combined with our analysis of
the material at ground zero,

15:50.840 --> 15:52.049
we are now confident

15:52.050 --> 15:54.009
that Tuwala used his entire supply,

15:54.010 --> 15:56.009
approximately two kilograms,

15:56.010 --> 15:57.669
on the device that detonated in Virginia.

15:57.670 --> 16:00.299
What about the rest of the stolen uranium?

16:00.300 --> 16:03.089
CIA is into it, but the
trail is pretty cold.

16:03.090 --> 16:05.800
- Not exactly the stuff of lullabies.
- Our current thinking

16:05.801 --> 16:07.087
is that it's still overseas.

16:07.088 --> 16:08.213
"Our current thinking"?

16:08.214 --> 16:09.337
NIRT team

16:09.338 --> 16:11.917
just gave the all clear. We're
ready to go, Mr. President.

16:11.918 --> 16:13.167
Let's do it.

16:13.168 --> 16:16.627
Apollo team in position.
Standing by for green.

16:16.628 --> 16:18.898
Apollo, you are green to enter.

16:20.208 --> 16:21.797
Go, go, go.

16:21.798 --> 16:22.978
Go, go, go!

16:28.668 --> 16:29.858
There it is.

16:42.109 --> 16:43.781
- Clear!
- Eagle, it's empty.

16:43.782 --> 16:44.978
Guy pulled up stakes.

16:44.979 --> 16:46.148
Nothing but an air mattress.

16:46.149 --> 16:47.688
Copy, Apollo.

16:47.689 --> 16:49.409
So much for leads.

16:50.279 --> 16:52.938
So it was a suicide mission all along.

16:52.939 --> 16:54.108
Mr. President,

16:54.109 --> 16:57.028
Saudi GID just gave us everything they have

16:57.029 --> 16:59.318
on the terrorist
organization Hizb Al-Shahid.

16:59.319 --> 17:01.188
Including a cell phone intercept,

17:01.189 --> 17:02.978
with a recording of Disah's voice.

17:02.979 --> 17:04.068
Alleged voice.

17:04.069 --> 17:06.147
We don't have any recordings
of him in our files.

17:06.148 --> 17:08.028
But if it is him, we have a target.

17:08.029 --> 17:11.278
Yes, sir. NSA says the
signal originated here,

17:11.279 --> 17:13.108
at a compound near Sirte.

17:13.108 --> 17:15.184
I took the liberty to deploy drones,

17:15.185 --> 17:16.792
just in case we get confirmation.

17:16.794 --> 17:19.123
And I'll reach out to our NATO allies,

17:19.124 --> 17:20.542
see if they have anything.

17:20.544 --> 17:23.123
Ephraim, I'm ending the
National Response protocols,

17:23.124 --> 17:24.792
including the order to shelter in place.

17:24.794 --> 17:25.761
Yes, Mr. President.

17:25.762 --> 17:27.094
- Sir, if that's the case...
- Go.

17:27.095 --> 17:28.131
Thank you.

17:28.132 --> 17:30.171
Godspeed.

17:30.172 --> 17:33.511
Italy, in theory, they've been
sharing everything they have

17:33.512 --> 17:34.921
on Hizb Al-Shahid, right?

17:34.922 --> 17:37.341
All of our NATO allies have been alerted.

17:37.342 --> 17:38.711
And Ambassador Civarelli responded

17:38.712 --> 17:40.712
- that he doesn't have anything.
- Which is hard to believe,

17:40.713 --> 17:42.131
with Libya right in their backyard.

17:42.132 --> 17:43.381
Not to mention the hostages.

17:43.382 --> 17:44.974
What hostages?

17:44.975 --> 17:47.381
In principle, Italy is like us...

17:47.382 --> 17:50.051
they don't negotiate with
terrorists. In practice...

17:50.052 --> 17:53.051
They've been paying ransom
to extremist groups for years.

17:53.052 --> 17:55.381
And you think Hizb
Al-Shahid is one of 'em?

17:55.382 --> 17:57.841
CIA has reports of two hostages from Libya

17:57.842 --> 17:59.921
who were freed only last week.

17:59.922 --> 18:02.471
France, Spain, Austria...

18:02.472 --> 18:04.471
a lot of our allies pay for hostages.

18:04.472 --> 18:05.472
Not from Libya.

18:05.473 --> 18:07.011
And that's Hizb Al-Shahid's hub.

18:07.012 --> 18:09.471
Well, if Italy's dealt with them,

18:09.472 --> 18:11.511
they have Intel they're withholding.

18:11.512 --> 18:13.921
Look, if I'm wrong, we
risk offending an ally

18:13.922 --> 18:16.341
who needs us more than we need them.

18:16.342 --> 18:18.272
But if I'm right...

18:19.262 --> 18:21.261
Call the secretary.

18:21.262 --> 18:22.772
Right now.

18:24.342 --> 18:26.844
- Where's Henry?
- Isolation ward, right this way.

18:26.845 --> 18:29.261
Yeah, thanks.

18:29.262 --> 18:31.841
Any word on the test results?

18:31.842 --> 18:33.761
Nothing yet. Uh, here.

18:33.762 --> 18:35.594
- What is this?
- Fruit punch. It's all they had.

18:35.595 --> 18:37.841
You forget to hydrate
when you're stressed, so...

18:37.842 --> 18:39.522
Okay.

18:41.212 --> 18:43.131
Okay. Where are the kids?

18:43.132 --> 18:45.341
They're in the chapel. Here,
he's right-right over here.

18:45.342 --> 18:46.421
This room.

18:46.422 --> 18:47.422
Sorry.

18:47.423 --> 18:49.692
Just... Yeah.

18:54.012 --> 18:55.551
Can I talk to him?

18:55.552 --> 18:56.732
Uh...

19:03.672 --> 19:06.362
Let him sleep.

19:08.302 --> 19:10.301
You okay, ma'am?

19:10.302 --> 19:13.732
No.

19:18.422 --> 19:21.471
Hey, kiddos. I'm so sorry I took so long.

19:21.472 --> 19:23.054
- Hi.
- Sorry. I'm sorry.

19:23.055 --> 19:25.551
Hey.

19:25.552 --> 19:26.717
Did you see Dad?

19:26.718 --> 19:27.881
He's sleeping.

19:27.882 --> 19:29.782
We're gonna go see him
when he wakes up, okay?

19:30.922 --> 19:32.711
Is he gonna be okay?

19:32.712 --> 19:35.131
Oh, baby, I don't know.

19:35.132 --> 19:37.482
I'm sorry.

19:40.972 --> 19:44.591
I thought religion was
the opiate of the masses.

19:44.592 --> 19:46.511
It is.

19:46.512 --> 19:50.812
But sometimes you need a good hit.

20:06.342 --> 20:07.427
Hey there.

20:07.428 --> 20:08.511
Huh?

20:08.512 --> 20:09.761
Oh. Hey.

20:09.762 --> 20:11.631
Everything all right?

20:11.632 --> 20:12.631
Yeah.

20:12.632 --> 20:13.632
I'm just, um....

20:13.633 --> 20:15.591
I'm looking for a place to crash tonight.

20:15.592 --> 20:18.011
I thought the perimeter was lifted.

20:18.012 --> 20:19.761
Oh, it was.

20:19.762 --> 20:22.862
Yeah. My apartment is ready for me.

20:23.922 --> 20:26.772
I'm just not ready for my apartment.

20:27.762 --> 20:29.841
I got this thing about dust, so...

20:29.842 --> 20:31.471
Okay then.

20:31.472 --> 20:35.051
I would ask Jay, but
he's got the baby. And...

20:36.283 --> 20:37.511
Daisy would be... no.

20:37.512 --> 20:40.211
And Blake's studio is about

20:40.212 --> 20:41.881
this size of one of his pocket squares.

20:41.882 --> 20:44.051
So I-I am about five minutes away

20:44.052 --> 20:45.711
from a desperation move on Tinder.

20:45.712 --> 20:47.551
You could have asked me.

20:47.552 --> 20:50.301
Thanks, but I'm allergic to cats.

20:50.302 --> 20:52.772
I don't have a cat.

20:53.712 --> 20:55.711
Really?

20:55.712 --> 20:56.881
Are you sure?

20:56.882 --> 20:58.375
'Cause I-I could have sworn you ha...

20:58.376 --> 20:59.572
You think I'm a cat lady?

20:59.573 --> 21:00.350
No.

21:00.351 --> 21:03.215
Ha. No. Of course not. I would, uh...

21:03.216 --> 21:04.415
I don't know why I said that.

21:04.416 --> 21:06.566
I'll text you the address.

21:07.626 --> 21:10.915
What are you doing?

21:10.916 --> 21:12.175
Here you go, ma'am.

21:12.176 --> 21:14.175
Thank you. Signor Ambasciatore.

21:14.176 --> 21:15.675
Madam Secretary.

21:15.676 --> 21:17.255
Thank you so much for meeting me here.

21:17.256 --> 21:19.187
I realize it's highly unusual.

21:19.188 --> 21:20.685
No, of course. Of course.

21:20.686 --> 21:22.725
Allow me to present Italy's condolences

21:22.726 --> 21:23.895
to the people of the United States.

21:23.896 --> 21:25.555
Very kind of you. Thank you.

21:25.556 --> 21:27.605
Listen, let me ask, when I took this job,

21:27.606 --> 21:29.605
did you, by chance, read my bio?

21:29.606 --> 21:31.605
The blurb on State's Web site?

21:31.606 --> 21:33.185
Yes, of course.

21:33.186 --> 21:35.236
You worked at CIA with
President Dalton and...

21:35.237 --> 21:39.075
Right. And my-my uncle

21:39.076 --> 21:41.738
- died on the beach at Anzio. William Adams.
- Yes.

21:41.739 --> 21:43.735
He was 18 years old.

21:43.736 --> 21:45.445
My brother is named after him.

21:45.446 --> 21:47.155
And my country is

21:47.156 --> 21:48.735
eternally grateful, for him

21:48.736 --> 21:51.735
and for every American who
died to save us from fascism.

21:51.736 --> 21:54.945
And yet when we were
attacked, you held out on us.

21:54.946 --> 21:56.535
I don't know what you mean.

21:56.536 --> 22:00.115
Your government has been
paying for hostages in Libya.

22:00.116 --> 22:03.985
The CIA has identified two
being held by Hizb Al-Shahid

22:03.986 --> 22:07.871
in Al Wahat. You have
intelligence you're not sharing.

22:07.872 --> 22:11.188
- The official policy of my government...
- I've had enough of official policy

22:11.189 --> 22:13.435
today. I mean, have you looked around?

22:13.436 --> 22:15.015
Do you see what's happened here?

22:15.016 --> 22:17.685
Well, Libya is already a failed state.

22:17.686 --> 22:21.265
Another intervention would
send waves of refugees

22:21.266 --> 22:22.766
hurtling towards our shores and...

22:22.767 --> 22:24.265
Refugees?

22:24.266 --> 22:26.345
That's your excuse?

22:26.346 --> 22:28.765
Well, I assure you it is a serious concern

22:28.766 --> 22:32.185
for the Italian people, not to
mention our national security.

22:32.186 --> 22:33.935
It's funny you should bring up security.

22:33.936 --> 22:36.685
Because maybe if we stop
the people who attacked us,

22:36.686 --> 22:37.686
then your voters

22:37.687 --> 22:39.515
will stop being kidnapped.

22:39.516 --> 22:41.185
Well, it's never that simple.

22:41.186 --> 22:42.765
Mmm, hardly. I agree.

22:42.766 --> 22:44.765
But sometimes it is.

22:44.766 --> 22:48.725
We have a recording that
we think is Jibral Disah.

22:48.726 --> 22:50.685
All we need is confirmation.

22:50.686 --> 22:52.885
Secretary McCord, your husband is awake.

22:52.886 --> 22:55.645
He's asking for you.

22:55.646 --> 22:59.366
I trust that your government's
gonna do the right thing.

23:07.306 --> 23:09.121
The doctor will be with you in a minute.

23:09.122 --> 23:10.935
Hey. Hi.

23:10.936 --> 23:12.018
- Hi.
- Finally!

23:12.019 --> 23:14.805
People without needles and pills!

23:14.806 --> 23:15.846
We love you!

23:15.847 --> 23:16.885
- Hi.
- Secretary McCord,

23:16.886 --> 23:18.638
I have the results of
your husband's bioassay.

23:18.639 --> 23:21.768
Henry's exposure was limited
to one sievert of radiation.

23:21.769 --> 23:23.938
That's enough for some nasty symptoms,

23:23.939 --> 23:25.308
but it's well below a fatal dose.

23:25.309 --> 23:26.598
He's gonna be fine.

23:26.599 --> 23:28.178
Oh. Thank you.

23:28.179 --> 23:30.558
Mom, let go of the doctor.

23:30.559 --> 23:32.521
- Can we see him now?
- Go ahead.

23:32.522 --> 23:33.978
We can? Okay.

23:35.040 --> 23:36.098
Hi. Hi. You're in.

23:36.099 --> 23:37.309
You're in! Hi. Hi, hi.

23:37.310 --> 23:38.518
Hi, Dad!

23:38.519 --> 23:40.391
- Hi, sweetheart. Hi, big man.
- Ooh!

23:40.392 --> 23:41.598
Come on.

23:41.599 --> 23:43.101
- Hey, buddy.
- How you feeling?

23:43.102 --> 23:44.888
Oh. Waiting for my superpowers to kick in.

23:44.889 --> 23:46.224
Hi.

23:46.225 --> 23:47.558
Hi.

23:47.559 --> 23:49.414
Are you okay?

23:49.415 --> 23:51.268
Hi. Yeah. I just want to go home.

23:51.269 --> 23:53.641
- Can I go home?
- As soon as you sign the release.

23:53.642 --> 23:55.099
- Really?
- Yeah.

23:55.100 --> 23:56.099
Okay.

24:13.437 --> 24:15.636
So, is it cool if I spend
the night at Bobby's tonight?

24:15.637 --> 24:17.489
Seriously? A sleepover, Jace?

24:17.490 --> 24:19.528
What? I'm returning to normalcy.

24:19.529 --> 24:20.694
Normality.

24:20.695 --> 24:21.858
It's an accepted form.

24:21.859 --> 24:23.279
Uh, not while I'm still breathing.

24:23.280 --> 24:25.358
Jace, are you seriously asking?

24:25.359 --> 24:29.118
No. Come on. We're gonna
go home as a family.

24:29.119 --> 24:31.647
While your father's still breathing.

24:31.648 --> 24:33.068
Besides, don't you want to see

24:33.069 --> 24:34.651
- if he glows in the dark?
- Ma'am,

24:34.652 --> 24:36.688
uh, I have Jay for you.

24:36.689 --> 24:37.862
Tell me the Italians came through.

24:37.863 --> 24:39.900
Big-time. The recording's authentic.

24:39.901 --> 24:43.400
Former hostage ID'd it as
the voice of Jibral Disah.

24:43.401 --> 24:45.190
So we have a target?

24:45.191 --> 24:47.690
White House is expecting you.

24:50.199 --> 24:51.299
Babe...

24:51.975 --> 24:52.870
It's okay.

24:52.871 --> 24:53.661
I got...

24:53.662 --> 24:55.410
I'm in good hands.

24:55.411 --> 24:56.910
I love you.

24:56.911 --> 24:58.583
- I love you.
- Okay.

24:58.584 --> 24:59.871
Take care of your dad.

24:59.872 --> 25:01.261
I will.

25:11.291 --> 25:12.450
Where are we?

25:12.451 --> 25:14.540
Our Reapers are just coming into range.

25:14.541 --> 25:16.040
Sir, before we launch,

25:16.041 --> 25:18.660
I think we should
consider a capture mission.

25:18.661 --> 25:20.660
What's the situation on the ground?

25:20.661 --> 25:23.450
Difficult. There are a number
of active militias in the area,

25:23.451 --> 25:27.290
plus whatever guys HS
has behind those walls.

25:27.291 --> 25:32.450
Well, after today's attack, I'm
not eager to underestimate them.

25:32.451 --> 25:33.790
I agree, sir.

25:33.791 --> 25:35.370
We could be looking at heavy casualties.

25:35.371 --> 25:38.200
For a target of this
value, isn't it worth it?

25:38.201 --> 25:39.580
I'm not saying go in hard.

25:39.581 --> 25:41.410
We can monitor then slowly contain them

25:41.411 --> 25:42.700
with Special Forces.

25:42.701 --> 25:45.490
How confident are we that Disah is there?

25:45.491 --> 25:46.620
80%.

25:46.621 --> 25:48.330
A man matching his description

25:48.331 --> 25:51.290
was seen entering the compound
a little over an hour ago.

25:51.291 --> 25:55.290
In 2001, we slow-played it on bin Laden.

25:55.291 --> 25:57.660
It was almost a decade
until we saw him again.

25:57.661 --> 25:59.790
Public does want a win, sir.

25:59.791 --> 26:01.790
So do I.

26:01.791 --> 26:04.051
And I don't want another Tora Bora, Dennis.

26:05.791 --> 26:06.950
Take the shot, Admiral.

26:06.951 --> 26:08.870
Yes, sir.

26:08.871 --> 26:12.410
Reaper One, Reaper Two,
you are cleared to engage.

26:12.411 --> 26:14.660
Copy. Missile on the way.

26:14.661 --> 26:16.250
Time of flight: eight seconds.

26:16.251 --> 26:19.490
Seven, six, five,

26:19.491 --> 26:23.591
four, three, two...

26:43.041 --> 26:45.490
Come on in.

26:45.491 --> 26:48.120
Here. Uh, let me take your coat.

26:48.121 --> 26:50.221
Oh. Oh. Thank you.

26:51.121 --> 26:53.221
Are you thirsty?

26:54.491 --> 26:58.330
Is-is that you with Nelson Mandela?

26:58.331 --> 27:00.660
You know what, I...

27:00.661 --> 27:02.080
I could go for a scotch.

27:02.081 --> 27:04.250
Single malt or blend?

27:04.251 --> 27:05.540
Surprise me.

27:05.541 --> 27:07.641
Okay.

27:12.251 --> 27:13.750
Hello?

27:13.751 --> 27:15.540
Ah, Gael.

27:28.331 --> 27:29.560
Sorry.

27:29.561 --> 27:31.390
That was an old friend.

27:31.391 --> 27:34.100
We were supposed to go see
Uncle Vanya this evening

27:34.101 --> 27:37.771
at the Kennedy Center,
but it was... canceled,

27:38.076 --> 27:39.223
obviously.

27:40.828 --> 27:43.490
- I didn't know you were into theater.
- Secret's out.

27:43.491 --> 27:45.657
Mm.

27:45.658 --> 27:47.657
That's lovely, isn't it?

27:47.658 --> 27:50.287
That was a present from Boris Yeltsin.

27:50.288 --> 27:51.834
Do you play?

27:51.835 --> 27:53.338
I dabble.

27:53.339 --> 27:55.824
I had to learn for an experimental piece

27:55.825 --> 27:57.334
my dance troupe did in Minsk.

27:58.284 --> 28:01.634
Here's to unexpected skills.

28:04.904 --> 28:07.153
Wow.

28:07.154 --> 28:08.403
Smoke bomb.

28:08.404 --> 28:09.549
Yeah.

28:10.694 --> 28:13.443
It's not the night for that expression.

28:13.444 --> 28:15.493
Sheets.

28:15.494 --> 28:17.734
You know, I always figured that you lived

28:17.735 --> 28:18.774
more like a...

28:18.775 --> 28:21.156
Not a cat lady, all right?

28:21.157 --> 28:22.866
I just mean more like me.

28:22.867 --> 28:24.196
Half of my furniture

28:24.197 --> 28:25.826
is from Ikea.

28:25.827 --> 28:27.286
And that's the good half.

28:27.287 --> 28:29.257
Well, we all have our priorities.

28:30.247 --> 28:31.497
I just can't

28:31.498 --> 28:35.228
get out of the mindset
that this is all temporary.

28:35.229 --> 28:38.388
Well, if you're worried
about job security...

28:38.389 --> 28:40.468
Well, that's a given in this town.

28:40.469 --> 28:43.228
No, I mean... I mean life.

28:43.229 --> 28:45.308
And that was before

28:45.309 --> 28:48.529
someone set off a bomb in my neighborhood.

28:49.519 --> 28:52.642
When I was a kid, I had severe asthma.

28:52.643 --> 28:53.693
Oh.

28:53.694 --> 28:56.834
I spent most of high
school in the hospital.

28:58.024 --> 29:02.063
My prom date was, uh, the most
beautiful drip bag on the ward.

29:02.064 --> 29:04.316
I grew out of the worst of it.

29:04.317 --> 29:07.153
Some of my friends weren't as lucky.

29:07.154 --> 29:09.023
That explains your fear of dust.

29:11.114 --> 29:15.214
My rational mind knows
that it's safe to go home.

29:16.944 --> 29:20.414
But I just... I can't.

29:21.734 --> 29:24.044
Not yet.

29:25.404 --> 29:28.063
Well...

29:28.064 --> 29:30.613
you can stay here as long as you like.

29:30.614 --> 29:32.914
No need for rationality.

29:37.614 --> 29:40.044
I'll get you a pillow.

29:53.484 --> 29:55.403
Wow.

29:55.404 --> 29:58.392
They sent the secretary
of state to check on me.

29:58.393 --> 30:00.549
Well, the president was busy, so...

30:00.550 --> 30:03.629
Mm. Yeah. Mm. Excuses. Excuses.

30:03.630 --> 30:04.438
Gosh.

30:04.439 --> 30:07.363
Hit by a dirty bomb,
and I still find you hot.

30:07.364 --> 30:10.073
Well, that's probably
'cause I'm radioactive.

30:11.447 --> 30:13.993
What do you think was up with Jason

30:13.994 --> 30:16.823
and that whole sleepover thing?

30:16.824 --> 30:18.823
Oh, he's a teenager.

30:18.824 --> 30:22.233
I think maybe he's afraid to sleep at home

30:22.234 --> 30:24.233
because on some level,

30:24.234 --> 30:26.233
this house is a target.

30:26.234 --> 30:27.863
This house is a fortress.

30:27.864 --> 30:31.384
So was the conference. Look what happened.

30:33.324 --> 30:36.443
Speaking of, the doctor said

30:36.444 --> 30:40.443
that the tourniquet you
applied to that woman's leg...

30:40.444 --> 30:42.193
it saved her life.

30:42.194 --> 30:43.294
Hmm.

30:44.234 --> 30:46.214
What is it?

30:47.194 --> 30:50.033
I've decided to rejoin DIA.

30:50.034 --> 30:51.794
Oh.

30:53.284 --> 30:55.834
Wow.

30:57.784 --> 30:59.153
You know, why don't we talk about this

30:59.154 --> 31:00.283
when you're feeling better?

31:00.284 --> 31:01.693
Babe, don't patronize me.

31:01.694 --> 31:03.113
You know, a few hours ago,

31:03.114 --> 31:06.113
I didn't know if you
were gonna live or die.

31:06.114 --> 31:07.925
Can't we just take a minute here?

31:07.926 --> 31:09.906
No. Hizb Al-Shahid isn't taking a minute.

31:09.907 --> 31:13.007
You really want to have
this conversation now?

31:14.566 --> 31:16.905
Okay, fine, but you know what?

31:16.906 --> 31:18.945
I don't think that we can handle

31:18.946 --> 31:21.775
the both of us being in
the line of fire again.

31:21.776 --> 31:24.275
Look what it did to our
marriage the first time.

31:24.276 --> 31:25.655
We were fine.

31:25.656 --> 31:26.855
We weren't.

31:26.856 --> 31:28.716
I wasn't.

31:31.316 --> 31:33.315
I got to close my eyes.

31:33.316 --> 31:35.405
Of course.

32:13.184 --> 32:14.124
Good morning.

32:14.125 --> 32:16.504
Good morning. Please.

32:16.505 --> 32:18.504
Eggs in the hole.

32:18.505 --> 32:21.145
The one and only dish in
my culinary repertoire.

32:22.795 --> 32:23.675
You shouldn't have.

32:23.676 --> 32:27.877
It's just a small token of my appreciation.

32:27.878 --> 32:30.099
I know it was an imposition.

32:30.100 --> 32:31.929
It really wasn't.

32:31.930 --> 32:33.450
I should be thanking you.

32:35.060 --> 32:37.809
It's hard to be alone
in the wake of a tragedy.

32:37.810 --> 32:40.639
Honestly, I was happy for the company.

32:40.640 --> 32:42.309
Me, too.

32:42.310 --> 32:45.019
So, how runny would you like your egg?

32:45.020 --> 32:47.070
It really doesn't matter.

32:48.270 --> 32:50.179
The pan's on fire.

32:50.180 --> 32:51.140
What?

32:51.141 --> 32:52.229
Oh.

32:52.230 --> 32:54.309
Uh, uh, uh...

33:01.810 --> 33:04.849
Jane, I want back in at DIA.

33:04.850 --> 33:06.461
I'd ask what changed your mind,

33:06.462 --> 33:08.540
but, uh, it seems fairly obvious.

33:08.541 --> 33:11.750
A dirty bomb does have a
way of clarifying things.

33:11.751 --> 33:13.750
That's irony for you.

33:13.751 --> 33:16.574
Okay. I'll run it up the flagpole,

33:16.575 --> 33:18.244
but it should be a formality.

33:18.245 --> 33:20.244
In the meantime, take care of yourself.

33:20.245 --> 33:21.217
- I will.
- Seriously, Dad?

33:21.218 --> 33:23.627
- You should be resting.
- Have you met our father?

33:23.628 --> 33:25.389
He doesn't just march to
the beat of his own drummer.

33:25.390 --> 33:26.929
He killed the drummer and smashed his drum.

33:26.930 --> 33:30.179
Did he also kill the doctor
that ordered him to stay in bed?

33:30.180 --> 33:33.050
Okay, okay, enough metaphoric violence.

33:33.051 --> 33:35.600
Um, and I'm feeling much
better, thank you for asking.

33:35.601 --> 33:36.640
Oh, good.

33:36.641 --> 33:37.846
Okay, bye. Please rest.

33:37.847 --> 33:38.495
Bye.

33:38.496 --> 33:39.313
- I will.
- I love you.

33:39.314 --> 33:40.473
- You, too. Bye.
- Bye, Dad.

33:40.474 --> 33:41.930
Are you going?

33:41.931 --> 33:43.143
- Yeah.
- All right. Bye.

33:43.144 --> 33:44.571
Bye.

33:48.615 --> 33:51.074
Did you call Jane Fellows?

33:51.075 --> 33:53.114
I did.

33:53.115 --> 33:54.609
I support your decision.

33:54.610 --> 33:56.237
No, you don't.

33:59.238 --> 34:00.737
Okay.

34:00.738 --> 34:02.737
I'm not gonna divorce you over it.

34:02.738 --> 34:04.987
Well, that's fair enough.

34:04.988 --> 34:07.817
Okay, good. Now will you
please get back in bed?

34:07.818 --> 34:08.987
Well, that depends.

34:08.987 --> 34:10.507
You gonna come with me?

34:11.818 --> 34:14.007
I'll give you five minutes.

34:19.947 --> 34:21.987
You okay for tonight?

34:21.987 --> 34:23.907
You know what? I think I'm okay.

34:23.908 --> 34:25.447
Oh. Good.

34:25.447 --> 34:28.277
That is, until the next
national existential crisis.

34:28.277 --> 34:29.382
You know?

34:32.277 --> 34:36.172
I'd like the secretary's
remarks for the NCTC by noon.

34:36.172 --> 34:37.581
On it.

34:37.884 --> 34:38.935
Satellites confirm

34:38.936 --> 34:40.974
the target was completely destroyed.

34:40.975 --> 34:43.143
But new SIGINT indicates

34:43.145 --> 34:46.474
that Jibral Disah was not
present at the compound.

34:46.475 --> 34:47.857
- You're sure?
- His phone

34:47.858 --> 34:50.893
pinged from as-Sultan,
about 60 klicks away.

34:50.895 --> 34:53.063
Obviously our recon team was mistaken about

34:53.065 --> 34:54.313
the target's identity.

34:54.315 --> 34:55.514
We probably missed the real McCoy

34:55.514 --> 34:56.934
by a matter of hours.

34:56.935 --> 34:57.983
So for all we know,

34:57.984 --> 34:59.193
he's gone to ground,

34:59.194 --> 35:01.853
free to rebuild the organization at will.

35:01.854 --> 35:03.483
I made the wrong call.

35:03.484 --> 35:06.580
No... sir.

35:06.581 --> 35:08.120
It was worth the shot.

35:08.121 --> 35:12.395
We eliminated key members
of the organization.

35:12.396 --> 35:13.592
The secretary is right.

35:13.593 --> 35:15.631
We, uh... we did real damage.

35:15.632 --> 35:18.631
Then again, that wasn't our mission.

35:18.632 --> 35:20.221
Mr. President,

35:20.222 --> 35:23.051
I'd like to offer my resignation.

35:23.052 --> 35:24.591
Ephraim, what...

35:24.592 --> 35:25.552
what are you doing?

35:25.553 --> 35:26.931
The right thing. Now that

35:26.932 --> 35:29.181
the dust has cleared on the dirty bomb,

35:29.182 --> 35:32.571
I have to take responsibility
for the botched raid at Moldova,

35:32.572 --> 35:34.700
and the failure to track

35:34.701 --> 35:36.370
the uranium used in the bomb.

35:36.371 --> 35:37.443
I'm the director

35:37.444 --> 35:38.983
of national intelligence.

35:38.984 --> 35:40.603
The buck stops with me.

35:40.604 --> 35:43.653
No. This wasn't on you, Ephraim.

35:43.654 --> 35:45.483
Not by a long shot.

35:45.484 --> 35:47.044
I won't accept.

35:47.984 --> 35:50.233
Sir.

35:50.234 --> 35:52.460
But rest assured, heads will roll.

35:53.029 --> 35:54.988
We need to make changes, and fast.

35:54.989 --> 35:57.318
Something our proud bureaucracy

35:57.319 --> 35:59.618
isn't exactly known for.

35:59.619 --> 36:01.618
Sir, if I may.

36:01.619 --> 36:05.198
If we're going to prevent future attacks,

36:05.199 --> 36:08.260
I suggest creating a special working group.

36:08.261 --> 36:10.173
- How special are we talking?
- I mean,

36:10.174 --> 36:12.500
an elite group with executive powers.

36:12.501 --> 36:15.323
- The tip of the spear.
- You're describing

36:15.324 --> 36:17.271
the National Security Council.

36:17.272 --> 36:19.350
No, the opposite, actually.

36:19.351 --> 36:21.470
We need to bypass the mandarins

36:21.471 --> 36:25.150
and find people who are willing
to challenge the status quo.

36:25.151 --> 36:26.269
Hizb Al-Shahid is

36:26.270 --> 36:28.598
unlike any terrorist group we've ever seen.

36:28.599 --> 36:30.848
If we're gonna stop them,

36:30.849 --> 36:33.518
we have to think outside the box.

36:33.519 --> 36:36.398
I'll take it under advisement.

36:36.399 --> 36:38.058
For the moment, let's adjourn.

36:38.059 --> 36:39.638
I have victims

36:39.639 --> 36:41.518
I have to go see.

36:41.519 --> 36:43.789
Dennis, why don't you hang back?

36:54.479 --> 36:56.369
Mate in three.

36:57.349 --> 36:59.478
No, no. No, I...

36:59.479 --> 37:01.728
I can... Oh.

37:01.729 --> 37:03.268
Busted.

37:03.269 --> 37:05.237
- So much for superpowers.
- Hey, watch it. I could

37:05.238 --> 37:07.858
still have death rays.
Well played, Padawan.

37:09.655 --> 37:11.784
I'm afraid your request has been denied.

37:11.785 --> 37:13.154
What? Why?

37:13.155 --> 37:14.734
No idea.

37:14.735 --> 37:18.234
But word is that Director
Ellerman just got fired.

37:18.235 --> 37:21.444
SecDef might be next, and the
bleeding doesn't stop there.

37:21.445 --> 37:23.194
The whole IC is in turmoil.

37:23.195 --> 37:24.574
That doesn't explain the decision.

37:24.575 --> 37:25.824
Look, I'm sorry, Henry.

37:25.825 --> 37:28.694
I wish I had an answer for you.

37:38.525 --> 37:40.524
Did you block me at DIA?

37:40.525 --> 37:41.715
Excuse me?

37:41.716 --> 37:42.904
I was rejected.

37:42.905 --> 37:44.784
Somebody had their finger on the scale.

37:44.785 --> 37:48.984
Well, I-I didn't have
my finger on any scale.

37:48.985 --> 37:51.694
Yeah, but you weren't exactly
thrilled about me rejoining.

37:51.695 --> 37:53.154
Did you say anything to
Ephraim Ware or Russell?

37:53.155 --> 37:55.324
Are you actually accusing me here?

37:55.325 --> 37:57.024
Look, maybe you just
complained about me rejoining,

37:57.025 --> 37:58.444
and they took it from there.

37:58.445 --> 37:59.694
I don't complain about you, Henry.

37:59.695 --> 38:01.574
Not anywhere. Not at work.

38:01.575 --> 38:03.324
And I'm starting to feel attacked.

38:03.325 --> 38:05.614
Well, I'm feeling played,
because it makes no sense.

38:06.905 --> 38:07.965
I'm on your side. I...

38:07.966 --> 38:09.024
Good.

38:09.025 --> 38:12.784
Then call the president
and ask him to reinstate me.

38:12.785 --> 38:13.944
Uh...

38:16.945 --> 38:19.045
Hello.

38:21.115 --> 38:22.444
Okay.

38:22.445 --> 38:26.074
Well, you can ask him yourself.

38:26.075 --> 38:28.074
That was the White House.

38:28.075 --> 38:29.784
Conrad's on his way over here.

38:29.785 --> 38:32.835
Now?

38:33.785 --> 38:35.484
Hi, Conrad.

38:35.485 --> 38:37.654
Henry. Good to see you back on your feet.

38:37.655 --> 38:39.091
Good to be back on my feet. Hey, Russell.

38:39.092 --> 38:40.281
Can I get you a drink?

38:40.282 --> 38:41.470
No, I'm good, thanks.

38:41.471 --> 38:43.630
I will get out of your hair.

38:43.631 --> 38:44.840
No.

38:44.841 --> 38:46.723
- Stay.
- Uh...

38:46.724 --> 38:48.010
Oh, God.

38:48.011 --> 38:50.745
Jason! Socks!

38:50.746 --> 38:52.118
- Sorry.
- Sorry!

38:52.119 --> 38:53.546
Sorry.

38:54.996 --> 38:59.386
So, I, uh, heard you're
interested in rejoining DIA.

39:00.326 --> 39:02.655
Yeah, that's right.

39:02.656 --> 39:04.825
But, apparently, the feeling wasn't mutual.

39:04.826 --> 39:06.785
They were just acting on my orders.

39:06.786 --> 39:07.633
I see.

39:07.634 --> 39:10.078
Because your wife told
me something this morning

39:10.079 --> 39:11.865
that stuck with me.

39:11.866 --> 39:14.865
I'm starting a working group,

39:14.866 --> 39:17.285
and making Russell its point man.

39:17.286 --> 39:19.575
I want the circle to be tight

39:19.576 --> 39:23.495
and close, and I want you to be on it.

39:23.496 --> 39:25.495
I'll check in from time to time,

39:25.496 --> 39:28.245
but for the most part, it'll be autonomous.

39:28.246 --> 39:29.785
What? Uh, uh, uh, wait.

39:29.786 --> 39:31.825
I'm playing catch-up here. What is this?

39:31.826 --> 39:34.155
It's a special working group,

39:34.156 --> 39:36.075
tasked with tracking Hizb Al-Shahid,

39:36.076 --> 39:38.865
in particular its leader, Jibral Disah.

39:38.866 --> 39:40.245
With the ultimate goal

39:40.246 --> 39:41.756
of eradicating both.

39:43.746 --> 39:45.905
Okay.

39:45.906 --> 39:47.905
Okay. Why me?

39:47.906 --> 39:50.354
Because you have experience,

39:50.792 --> 39:53.042
an impartial point of view,

39:53.043 --> 39:56.810
and, frankly, because I trust you.

39:58.731 --> 40:00.494
And given what we're up against,

40:00.495 --> 40:03.629
your religious expertise
should be invaluable.

40:03.630 --> 40:05.408
My background is really more Medieval.

40:05.409 --> 40:07.778
So is our enemy.

40:07.779 --> 40:10.578
As far as we're concerned,
your fitness for this assignment

40:10.579 --> 40:12.538
is unmatched.

40:12.739 --> 40:15.719
And State will be fully read in.

40:17.659 --> 40:20.078
Which means that I'll be...

40:20.079 --> 40:21.578
We can actually...

40:21.579 --> 40:22.701
- Talk.
- ...talk to each other.

40:22.702 --> 40:24.318
With luck, we should be able

40:24.319 --> 40:26.738
to cut through any intelligence
community disconnects

40:26.739 --> 40:28.618
and bring Jibral Disah

40:28.619 --> 40:30.238
to justice, swiftly.

40:30.239 --> 40:33.118
So, Henry, what do you say?

40:33.119 --> 40:34.948
You up for helping to capture

40:34.949 --> 40:36.969
the most wanted terrorist on the planet?

40:38.699 --> 40:41.548
Yeah. I'm in.
