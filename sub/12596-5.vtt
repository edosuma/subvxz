01:24.335 --> 01:26.421
Yeah, okay.

01:28.923 --> 01:29.924
It's nice.

01:30.883 --> 01:32.427
Why'd you bring me here?

01:34.137 --> 01:36.973
I was thinking it might be good
for the kid to see this place.

01:37.515 --> 01:40.184
I'm not gonna let you do that
to him again.

01:41.519 --> 01:42.353
What?

01:43.104 --> 01:44.856
You show up in his life...

01:46.316 --> 01:47.609
and yank him around.

01:48.192 --> 01:49.402
Don't say that.

01:50.153 --> 01:52.822
There's a reason he won't call you back.

01:53.990 --> 01:56.326
He doesn't wanna see you, Danny.

01:56.492 --> 01:58.953
So, why don't you talk to him for me?

01:59.579 --> 02:01.873
What, so you're feeling good
about your life now,

02:01.956 --> 02:04.417
so he's just supposed to come running
back to you with open arms?

02:04.500 --> 02:05.376
No.

02:06.836 --> 02:08.838
No, it's not like that.

02:09.213 --> 02:10.882
Yeah, it is like that.

02:10.965 --> 02:11.799
It is.

02:13.676 --> 02:15.595
I think if he sees this place,

02:16.304 --> 02:17.972
and he sees what's possible--

02:18.056 --> 02:21.893
Then he might see
that his dad's not a total fuck-up?

02:26.147 --> 02:27.857
Yeah, okay.

02:29.609 --> 02:31.194
Well, that might be good for him.

02:39.160 --> 02:40.328
Good for him.

02:45.208 --> 02:48.461
We all get the family
that God dumps on us.

02:48.669 --> 02:50.630
So, just talk to him. Please.

03:01.432 --> 03:03.267
I'm worried about the kid.

03:05.770 --> 03:06.604
What do you mean?

03:08.314 --> 03:10.108
I mean Nolan. Nolan.

03:10.191 --> 03:11.984
You don't think he's getting snowed
by these people?

03:15.905 --> 03:16.948
He's fine.

03:17.407 --> 03:18.574
He's fine. He's fine.

03:18.658 --> 03:20.993
Because it's one thing
you not getting what you deserve,

03:21.077 --> 03:24.622
it's another fucking thing that kid think
he's part of that goddamn family, okay?

03:24.914 --> 03:26.541
Nolan's a sharp kid.

03:28.084 --> 03:29.335
He's got his eyes open.

03:31.129 --> 03:34.424
Well, he ought to show a lot more respect
for what you've been through.

03:35.007 --> 03:36.259
He's a kid.

03:36.342 --> 03:38.845
So were you, and these
fucking people taking advantage,

03:38.970 --> 03:41.139
thinking they're so damn important.

03:41.639 --> 03:44.851
Thinking they can cut the payments off
whenever they fucking want.

03:45.852 --> 03:47.729
Treating you like shit
all these fucking years.

03:47.812 --> 03:50.064
I just fucking hate those motherfuckers.

03:50.606 --> 03:52.692
It's so wrong. It's bullshit.

03:53.443 --> 03:56.821
Fucking treating us like--
Like, we're fucking nothing in this--

03:58.030 --> 03:59.198
What-- Motherfucker!

03:59.282 --> 04:00.283
This is bullshit!

04:01.743 --> 04:02.952
Fucking shit!

04:03.327 --> 04:04.871
-Fuck!
-Baby.

04:04.954 --> 04:07.874
You sweet thing like that,
being treated like garbage.

04:09.417 --> 04:10.418
Look at me.

04:13.755 --> 04:16.257
Baby,
I don't want you going crazy on anyone.

04:18.426 --> 04:20.011
I don't want anyone to get hurt.

04:21.387 --> 04:22.221
Hey.

04:22.847 --> 04:24.432
-Look at me.
-No.

04:27.894 --> 04:29.645
-No, don't-- Don't do that.
-Look at me.

04:29.812 --> 04:30.772
No.

04:32.148 --> 04:33.441
You're missing out.

04:40.823 --> 04:42.533
Let me talk to him.

04:42.909 --> 04:44.660
I wanna take care of this.

04:45.620 --> 04:47.622
-Let me talk to him again.
-I'm telling you.

04:47.705 --> 04:50.500
There's plenty of ways
to make those people pay.

04:55.838 --> 04:57.215
Trust me.

04:57.632 --> 04:58.466
All right?

05:04.847 --> 05:05.890
Say it.

05:17.902 --> 05:19.362
I trust you.

05:22.448 --> 05:25.952
You know you're the only fucking person
I trust in this whole world.

05:59.735 --> 06:01.404
I talked to the ADA.

06:01.988 --> 06:04.615
She's gonna consider
all the extenuating circumstances:

06:04.824 --> 06:07.577
The family tragedy,
the stress that you've been under.

06:08.077 --> 06:10.162
The fact
that you're a first-time offender.

06:10.955 --> 06:12.498
You told her we're having a baby?

06:13.416 --> 06:15.126
Yeah, I told her everything.

06:18.170 --> 06:20.423
Okay, so what am I looking at?

06:20.548 --> 06:22.174
You plead to the DUI.

06:23.509 --> 06:24.844
What about the drugs?

06:25.469 --> 06:27.305
Cocaine possession is a felony.

06:27.805 --> 06:28.723
But...

06:30.933 --> 06:32.893
I got her to drop the charges.

06:33.936 --> 06:35.605
--If...

06:37.690 --> 06:40.359
you are serious
about a substance abuse program.

06:44.447 --> 06:46.157
And agree to one year probation.

06:46.657 --> 06:48.034
And a suspended license.

06:54.707 --> 06:56.375
Do you guys need to talk about it?

06:59.754 --> 07:00.963
No, I'll take it.

07:02.423 --> 07:04.383
Thank you, Meg. Thank you.

07:05.259 --> 07:07.094
You cannot fuck up again.

07:09.513 --> 07:10.473
He won't.

07:23.110 --> 07:23.986
Mrs. Rayburn.

07:24.528 --> 07:26.739
Hey, Mr. Ward. How can I help you, sir?

07:26.822 --> 07:29.659
My wife went to turn the shower on,
and there's a kind of thumping sound.

07:29.742 --> 07:31.911
Like there's not enough pressure,
and nothing comes out.

07:32.078 --> 07:34.372
Oh, no. That's not good.

07:35.039 --> 07:37.291
Well, I'll have somebody come look at it.

07:37.500 --> 07:39.085
My wife and I had a long drive.

07:39.293 --> 07:41.545
I'm sorry. It's Bungalow 3, right?

07:41.629 --> 07:42.463
Yes.

07:42.880 --> 07:44.966
Well, we'll--
We'll get that fixed right away.

07:45.049 --> 07:47.385
-Thank you.
-And my apologies.

08:02.858 --> 08:04.944
John's well on his way, Tanya.

08:05.194 --> 08:07.530
We're putting together a staff
of volunteers.

08:07.697 --> 08:09.448
We've leased a space.

08:10.157 --> 08:11.158
Word is getting out.

08:11.242 --> 08:12.952
You don't have to sell me, Larry.

08:13.035 --> 08:16.038
- I traded a carpool shift to be here.
- Heh, heh, heh.

08:16.163 --> 08:18.249
How are you feeling about all of this,
Diana?

08:19.583 --> 08:21.919
I support John's decision to run.

08:22.420 --> 08:25.423
- This is really important to him.
- And the rest of your family?

08:25.798 --> 08:26.882
Everybody all in?

08:27.341 --> 08:29.844
Yeah, kids are really enthusiastic.

08:30.177 --> 08:31.178
Good.

08:31.721 --> 08:34.015
They can help sell your roots
in the community.

08:34.223 --> 08:36.559
And you're gonna wanna hard sell
your arrest record, too.

08:36.767 --> 08:37.643
You--

08:38.019 --> 08:41.105
You haven't asked me why I'm running.

08:41.313 --> 08:42.732
I don't see it as a mystery.

08:42.857 --> 08:45.818
You've dedicated your whole life
to being a public servant.

08:45.901 --> 08:49.196
Your family has been part of the fabric
of this place for 50 years.

08:49.280 --> 08:52.783
-Am I missing something?
-There is the issue of my brother Danny.

08:53.325 --> 08:55.202
If you hire me to manage your campaign,

08:55.369 --> 08:57.788
my job is to exploit the positives.
End of story.

08:57.997 --> 08:59.498
Your name, your record.

09:00.249 --> 09:01.167
I guarantee you.

09:01.250 --> 09:03.627
Aguirre would kill to have either one.

09:03.836 --> 09:06.005
That being said, right out of the gate,

09:06.088 --> 09:07.840
he's ahead by a large margin.

09:09.800 --> 09:11.010
Aware of that.

09:11.844 --> 09:15.347
But... Aguirre runs soft
at the southern end of the county.

09:15.431 --> 09:17.933
So, I'd suggest you
concentrate your efforts there.

09:19.685 --> 09:22.563
Speaking of which,
where are you with funding?

09:22.772 --> 09:25.900
Roy Gilbert's reached out
to discuss his support.

09:26.400 --> 09:27.818
- Roy Gilbert?
- Mm-hm.

09:27.943 --> 09:29.487
-Very nice.
-Yep.

09:29.570 --> 09:32.698
We get Roy Gilbert on board,
you're in better shape than I thought.

09:57.223 --> 09:58.140
First time?

09:59.058 --> 10:01.769
- It's-- It's that obvious, huh?

10:02.436 --> 10:03.646
Yeah, you got the look.

10:04.563 --> 10:06.357
Piece of advice, avoid the donuts.

10:06.565 --> 10:09.610
Six months from now, you'll wake up clean
and 20 pounds fatter.

10:10.778 --> 10:12.446
-Doug.
-Hey.

10:17.034 --> 10:20.454
I'm just here because I--
I got a court situation, you know.

10:23.582 --> 10:24.416
Right.

10:26.293 --> 10:29.713
Just trying to show good faith.
You know, get a sentence suspended.

10:34.176 --> 10:35.469
Meeting's gonna start.

10:44.061 --> 10:45.646
What is going on, Mac?

10:45.729 --> 10:47.690
The shower's still not working.

10:49.191 --> 10:50.943
Bungalow 3.

10:51.152 --> 10:52.736
You were supposed to fix it.

10:54.738 --> 10:57.449
I don't know. Weeks ago.

11:00.786 --> 11:02.913
What are you talking about,
I never called?

11:04.081 --> 11:07.126
Okay. Well, look. Just--
Just get here as soon as you can.

11:34.778 --> 11:35.779
Did you talk?

11:40.618 --> 11:42.453
They call it sharing.

11:45.623 --> 11:46.957
Did you share?

11:50.294 --> 11:51.128
No.

11:56.425 --> 11:58.969
This investigation
has culminated in the termination

11:59.053 --> 12:00.554
of a local trafficking ring,

12:00.638 --> 12:03.599
and the seizure of several million
dollars' worth of narcotics.

12:03.807 --> 12:05.351
None of this would have been possible

12:05.434 --> 12:08.896
without the support and cooperation
of Sheriff Frank Aguirre.

12:09.104 --> 12:10.981
And the Monroe County
Sheriff's Department.

12:11.065 --> 12:12.775
-Sheriff.
-Thank you, Clay. Thank you.

12:12.858 --> 12:17.279
Thank you. I'd also like to add that
there are over half a dozen murder cases

12:17.363 --> 12:21.033
involving Wayne Lowry
that are now officially closed.

12:22.368 --> 12:25.454
We're very proud
of what we've accomplished.

12:26.372 --> 12:29.875
Which is why,
with great frustration and a heavy heart,

12:29.959 --> 12:32.962
I must mention a case
that we've yet to solve.

12:33.796 --> 12:36.674
As many of you here know,
Detective John Rayburn,

12:36.882 --> 12:40.302
one of our finest officers,
a colleague,

12:40.552 --> 12:41.595
and a friend.

12:42.262 --> 12:46.392
Recently, Detective Rayburn's brother,
Daniel, was a victim of a homicide.

12:46.850 --> 12:49.603
Now, despite Daniel Rayburn's
criminal activity,

12:49.687 --> 12:52.690
and his known association
with Wayne Lowry,

12:53.482 --> 12:57.236
we have reason to consider his death
an open investigation.

12:59.279 --> 13:02.908
And I just wanna say to Detective Rayburn
and the entire Rayburn family

13:02.992 --> 13:04.785
that this department will not stop

13:05.369 --> 13:06.870
until we apprehend the person

13:06.954 --> 13:09.832
who perpetrated
this brutal act of violence.

13:17.423 --> 13:19.508
How can he just keep the case open?

13:20.718 --> 13:23.137
Why the fuck is he doing this?

13:23.345 --> 13:24.471
To help his campaign.

13:24.888 --> 13:27.558
He wants everybody to know
who Danny was, and what he did.

13:27.641 --> 13:31.186
John, you told us that everyone thinks
Lowry is responsible for this, right?

13:31.270 --> 13:34.565
Isn't that what you said?
How can Aguirre just keep the case open?

13:35.274 --> 13:37.317
Sheriff has discretion
in a case like this.

13:37.568 --> 13:39.945
All right, then you're gonna become
the fucking sheriff.

13:43.198 --> 13:44.324
Or drop out.

13:46.160 --> 13:46.994
Right?

13:48.245 --> 13:49.997
Aguirre's not gonna drag
on the investigation

13:50.080 --> 13:52.499
if you're not running against him,
so pull out of the race.

13:52.666 --> 13:54.543
I mean, why wouldn't you just drop out?

13:54.835 --> 13:55.836
Oh, fuck.

13:56.045 --> 13:57.880
I gotta think about it.

14:02.176 --> 14:03.594
Yeah.

14:06.764 --> 14:08.974
Sorry, this is taking so long.

14:09.058 --> 14:10.184
Is everything okay?

14:10.392 --> 14:12.603
They wanna run one more test.

14:13.020 --> 14:16.106
They think the baby
might be a little underweight.

14:16.190 --> 14:18.025
Oh, I wouldn't worry about that.

14:18.233 --> 14:19.651
Well, Kevin was small.

14:21.070 --> 14:22.905
Actually turned out to be a good thing.

14:23.322 --> 14:26.367
Made for an easier delivery.

14:30.621 --> 14:32.081
Have you two talked yet?

14:32.581 --> 14:36.168
No, not-- Not since his, uh, accident.

14:37.669 --> 14:39.630
I think it's important
that he talk to you.

14:42.966 --> 14:46.053
Look, he's not the first person down here
to get a DUI.

14:46.261 --> 14:47.679
It wasn't just a DUI.

14:47.763 --> 14:50.307
He was arrested for drug possession.

14:50.766 --> 14:53.310
Well, Meg said she's already taken care
of all that legal stuff.

14:56.980 --> 14:58.482
Okay.

14:59.191 --> 15:01.944
He lost his father. He lost his brother.

15:02.861 --> 15:04.780
-That's a lot.
-Oh, please.

15:05.447 --> 15:07.533
Just stop doing that.

15:08.492 --> 15:09.785
This is real.

15:10.244 --> 15:12.704
Kevin has a problem
and he has to face it.

15:13.288 --> 15:16.583
It would help if the family
would be honest about it, too.

15:17.000 --> 15:21.588
Let's just...
not turn this into a drama, okay?

15:22.464 --> 15:24.466
Sally, please call him.

15:28.595 --> 15:29.888
-Hey, Detective.
-Denise.

15:29.972 --> 15:32.975
-Are you here on the Lowry murder?
-Yeah.

15:33.058 --> 15:35.310
-They finished searching his place...
-Mm-hm.

15:35.394 --> 15:36.520
His house, his business,

15:36.603 --> 15:39.189
everything they confiscated
came in this morning.

15:40.899 --> 15:42.025
-Thanks.
-Thank you.

16:47.925 --> 16:49.927
<i>♪ Look beyond the corners ♪</i>

16:51.053 --> 16:53.639
<i>♪ Look way up high ♪</i>

16:56.475 --> 16:58.185
Oh, shit.

17:02.231 --> 17:03.357
How you doing?

17:05.025 --> 17:06.860
You're Nolan, right? Danny's son?

17:09.696 --> 17:12.157
I need to make some cash,
but I don't know shit about boats.

17:14.284 --> 17:16.870
Why don't you grab that bucket
and that brush, okay?

17:17.371 --> 17:19.373
I was thinking, maybe,
I could work indoors.

17:23.585 --> 17:25.712
I was really hoping to learn
about engines.

17:26.380 --> 17:28.215
And I was really hoping
Doctor Clark's<i> Dauntless</i>

17:28.298 --> 17:30.384
could get scrubbed clean of bird shit.

17:36.723 --> 17:39.142
Maybe that's why
this place is going under.

17:40.686 --> 17:42.229
You don't dream big enough.

17:50.028 --> 17:51.446
Hey, listen.

17:51.530 --> 17:52.823
You want a job or not?

17:55.617 --> 17:56.535
Fuck it.

17:57.744 --> 18:00.330
Where are the buckets... boss?

18:02.082 --> 18:03.166
Right behind you.

18:15.971 --> 18:16.888
Hungry?

18:17.389 --> 18:18.307
No.

18:23.437 --> 18:24.896
You know what,
I can whip you up something.

18:24.980 --> 18:27.691
-Let me show you what the old man--
-I said I'm not hungry.

18:32.154 --> 18:34.156
Okay.

18:42.456 --> 18:45.459
So, basically,
you cook for a bunch of rich people.

18:48.545 --> 18:51.715
No. Nolan.

18:53.008 --> 18:54.509
You got it the wrong way around.

18:54.593 --> 19:00.557
What happens is,
a bunch of rich people pay me to cook.

19:02.351 --> 19:03.769
Whatever you say.

19:14.154 --> 19:15.572
You got a girlfriend?

19:16.365 --> 19:17.783
Don't worry about it.

19:19.284 --> 19:20.661
You're not a virgin, are you?

19:20.744 --> 19:21.912
No.

19:24.039 --> 19:25.332
Yeah, you are.

19:28.210 --> 19:29.628
Fuck you. I've been laid.

19:29.711 --> 19:32.130
Yeah? How many times?

19:32.214 --> 19:33.799
-Three.
-Three?

19:36.760 --> 19:39.054
Three times. Cool.

19:41.014 --> 19:42.057
Well...

19:44.893 --> 19:48.146
if you're old enough to have sex,
you're old enough to drink.

20:12.254 --> 20:13.255
Hey.

20:14.172 --> 20:16.049
Sit down, would you, please?

20:17.259 --> 20:18.135
Okay.

20:18.677 --> 20:19.678
Yeah?

20:20.387 --> 20:22.097
Did you think about what I said?

20:24.433 --> 20:25.642
I did.

20:28.562 --> 20:30.147
I'm not dropping out.

20:31.440 --> 20:32.649
John...

20:33.483 --> 20:34.484
come on.

20:36.570 --> 20:39.573
You think I don't understand
what you're going through? I do.

20:41.366 --> 20:44.369
You want a future. I get it.
That's what I wanted with New York.

20:47.748 --> 20:50.751
You know, start over,
go somewhere else and be somebody else.

20:50.834 --> 20:52.669
Look, that's not what this is about.

20:55.297 --> 20:57.299
Dropping out is not an option.

20:58.800 --> 20:59.676
Why?

21:01.094 --> 21:02.304
We're not safe.

21:03.430 --> 21:05.140
What do you mean, "we're not safe"?

21:06.266 --> 21:07.893
Why aren't we safe, John?

21:07.976 --> 21:09.478
Danny made a tape.

21:10.395 --> 21:11.772
What are you talking about?

21:12.731 --> 21:14.941
Danny made a recording of everything.

21:15.025 --> 21:16.902
He gave the tape to Wayne Lowry.

21:18.528 --> 21:20.030
What do you mean, "everything"?

21:23.867 --> 21:25.452
Moving the drugs...

21:26.495 --> 21:28.371
and lying to the DA, and--

21:31.625 --> 21:33.043
Everything.

21:36.755 --> 21:39.758
Okay, but Wayne Lowry's dead,
so then he can't--

21:49.851 --> 21:51.144
Who has the tape?

21:54.940 --> 21:56.483
I don't know.

22:06.451 --> 22:07.577
Fuck!

22:11.248 --> 22:12.374
Fuck.

22:21.383 --> 22:22.592
Listen to me.

22:23.593 --> 22:25.303
Me being sheriff...

22:27.806 --> 22:29.724
it gives me certain control over things.

22:30.392 --> 22:33.019
So, I don't have a choice, Meg.
I have to run.

22:37.315 --> 22:38.858
But I need your help.

22:40.193 --> 22:43.238
My help? What am I gonna do, John?
How am I gonna help you?

22:44.614 --> 22:46.324
Help me run this campaign.

22:47.200 --> 22:49.411
You're the only person I can trust.

23:07.971 --> 23:09.848
You should've fucking told me.

23:27.073 --> 23:28.074
Kev?

23:33.246 --> 23:34.247
Hey.

23:35.832 --> 23:37.375
How did it go at the doctor?

23:38.084 --> 23:40.629
-Everything went fine.
-Yeah? Good.

23:44.633 --> 23:45.967
How's Nolan working out?

23:46.509 --> 23:48.303
What? Fine.

23:54.768 --> 23:56.061
I don't know. He--

23:56.603 --> 23:59.356
He looks and acts
an awful lot like Danny. It--

24:01.441 --> 24:03.443
Maybe I just have to
get to know him better.

24:03.526 --> 24:04.694
I don't know.

24:08.907 --> 24:10.492
Would you like to invite him to dinner?

24:12.077 --> 24:13.620
What, like--? At our house?

24:15.538 --> 24:18.166
Yeah. Yeah. Yes, of course.
That-- That would be--

24:19.793 --> 24:20.919
It would be nice.

24:23.546 --> 24:25.548
Thank you for suggesting it.

24:31.346 --> 24:32.764
Nice of you two to come out.

24:32.847 --> 24:35.350
Well, it's a beautiful home
you have here, Mr. Gilbert.

24:35.433 --> 24:38.436
- Thank you for having us.
- You can see forever today, huh?

24:38.520 --> 24:39.854
Well...

24:41.690 --> 24:43.149
I might be old-fashioned, John,

24:43.233 --> 24:46.277
but I like to look a man in the eye,
see what he's made of,

24:46.361 --> 24:49.072
before I decide
whether to go to war with him.

24:49.155 --> 24:50.699
I understand.

24:50.949 --> 24:53.034
Your father could stare you down...

24:53.702 --> 24:57.330
make you confess to every sin
you ever committed. Heh, heh.

24:58.039 --> 25:00.417
- Meg and I are well aware of that stare.
- Heh.

25:00.959 --> 25:01.835
I have to tell you,

25:01.918 --> 25:05.338
I'm a bit surprised you didn't hire
a more experienced campaign manager.

25:05.714 --> 25:10.719
Well, I figured that this election
is gonna live or die with the family name.

25:10.802 --> 25:13.930
Having Meg run the campaign,
that's, uh--

25:14.013 --> 25:15.557
Well, that's-- Thank you.

25:15.640 --> 25:16.850
That's all part of it.

25:20.937 --> 25:25.442
Actually, the truth is
everyone else turned us down, Mr. Gilbert.

25:26.276 --> 25:29.404
Everybody's afraid of the controversy
surrounding our brother Danny.

25:29.571 --> 25:30.780
Shouldn't they be?

25:31.573 --> 25:34.200
You know, with what I do,
I've learned that the--

25:34.284 --> 25:36.202
The people down here,
they know how to survive

25:36.286 --> 25:39.664
because they know what's real,
and who's authentic, who's not.

25:41.040 --> 25:42.333
They'll see through that noise.

25:42.417 --> 25:46.463
Are you familiar with the latest polling?
Aguirre is way out front.

25:46.546 --> 25:49.174
Yeah. Well, we expect that
because he's the incumbent.

25:49.299 --> 25:52.385
We figure your endorsement
is good for at least a ten-point bump.

25:53.470 --> 25:55.054
Well, right now you're down by 20.

25:55.138 --> 25:57.474
-Where do you find the other ten?
-John,

25:57.557 --> 25:59.934
he's gonna court the county commission
and the small businesses.

26:00.018 --> 26:04.439
He's gonna go to the pancake breakfasts,
ballparks, Rotary clubs, whatever it is.

26:06.024 --> 26:08.401
Every election
pretty much works the same down here.

26:09.194 --> 26:12.489
-You've done your research.
-Yeah. I'm a quick study.

26:14.032 --> 26:15.909
Still might not be enough.

26:16.659 --> 26:18.077
You knew my father.

26:18.661 --> 26:21.080
I have the same attitude about losing
that he had.

26:21.706 --> 26:24.334
Your father was a son of a bitch.

26:24.417 --> 26:28.838
You're damn right he was, but would you
ever consider betting against him?

26:30.799 --> 26:32.175
Hm.

26:36.346 --> 26:37.931
Let me see something.

26:38.014 --> 26:39.724
Here, I got it.

26:40.225 --> 26:41.684
No. No, wait.

26:42.936 --> 26:44.771
All right, here. All right.
I got it. I got it.

26:44.854 --> 26:46.815
All right. So, it's Westbrook. It's 158--

26:50.443 --> 26:51.945
I gotta call you back.

26:53.488 --> 26:55.114
Congratulations.

26:57.242 --> 26:58.952
You got all your violations dropped.

27:00.203 --> 27:02.205
Worked out a hell of a deal for yourself.

27:02.288 --> 27:03.873
Right place, right time.

27:08.086 --> 27:09.838
You were smart coming in, though.

27:10.755 --> 27:12.549
My PO said I had to.

27:13.550 --> 27:16.386
What do you know about
that debt Danny had up in Miami?

27:17.595 --> 27:20.139
He needed cash, that's all I know.

27:20.223 --> 27:21.599
He needed cash.

27:21.975 --> 27:24.185
So, he started running drugs
for Wayne Lowry?

27:25.061 --> 27:26.229
And it worked.

27:27.063 --> 27:29.774
He was making good money.
I mean, really good money.

27:30.483 --> 27:32.986
Which makes me wonder
why he would turn on Lowry.

27:35.238 --> 27:36.614
Who said he turned?

27:36.698 --> 27:39.576
Your friend-- Well, your best friend.

27:39.659 --> 27:43.538
--had $2 million worth of Lowry's dope
tucked away in his place in Miami.

27:46.708 --> 27:49.127
What was the--?
What was the plan there, huh?

27:49.794 --> 27:52.922
I mean, Danny wasn't connected,
so how was he planning on moving--?

27:53.006 --> 27:55.425
I have no idea about any of this.

27:55.508 --> 27:56.885
-No?
-No.

27:56.968 --> 27:59.679
Did you know
that Lowry cleaned house before he died?

28:03.266 --> 28:07.353
He wiped out every member of his gang.
Well, except you.

28:08.396 --> 28:11.858
Hm. Eric fucking O'Bannon,
last man standing.

28:16.279 --> 28:17.572
You gotta wonder...

28:18.656 --> 28:19.574
why is that?

28:21.951 --> 28:22.952
Why?

28:27.373 --> 28:28.958
You wanna know what I think?

28:31.502 --> 28:32.754
What do you think, Columbo?

28:32.837 --> 28:35.840
I think you and Danny
both took Lowry's dope.

28:36.382 --> 28:38.176
But then Danny double-crossed you,

28:38.259 --> 28:40.887
took the dope,
and he hid it in his place in Miami.

28:40.970 --> 28:44.682
And then when Danny came back
down here, you killed him.

28:48.811 --> 28:50.230
Why would I do that?

28:50.313 --> 28:51.397
Why...?

28:52.690 --> 28:56.194
-Why the fuck would I do that?
-To make yourself square with Lowry.

28:58.279 --> 29:01.115
Shit, man. You don't know
what the fuck you're talking about.

29:01.658 --> 29:03.785
Well, I know you gave up Danny.

29:04.911 --> 29:06.329
That night in the motel.

29:08.081 --> 29:10.124
You're telling me you guys
didn't have a falling out?

29:10.208 --> 29:12.210
That's right, we did not.

29:12.293 --> 29:14.462
Answer one simple question for me.

29:15.964 --> 29:17.507
After that night...

29:18.299 --> 29:20.218
he never tried to reach out to you again.

29:21.386 --> 29:22.887
We have his phone records.

29:22.971 --> 29:25.890
He called his brother,
he texted your sister...

29:26.766 --> 29:28.601
and you, his best friend...

29:30.228 --> 29:32.438
he never reached out to you ever again.

29:33.273 --> 29:34.232
Why?

29:46.077 --> 29:47.704
You gotta wonder, huh?

29:55.712 --> 29:57.338
Do you want another beer?

29:58.631 --> 30:00.341
No, you better split.

30:01.259 --> 30:02.969
He's gonna be here soon.

30:07.640 --> 30:11.602
I'll get finished here with John,
then I'll swing by your place.

30:14.147 --> 30:15.023
And then what?

30:15.523 --> 30:17.775
Go up north, pick up the kid.

30:27.160 --> 30:28.286
See you, man.

30:51.309 --> 30:53.644
Hi, are you Evangeline? I'm Meg.

30:53.728 --> 30:55.313
-Hey. Thanks for coming to meet me.
-Hi.

30:55.396 --> 30:59.442
-Yeah. Of course.
-Sorry, to put you in an awkward position.

30:59.567 --> 31:00.568
How's that?

31:00.651 --> 31:04.614
Well, I know your mom
wants nothing to do with me, so...

31:07.492 --> 31:10.495
-Do you wanna get a drink?
-Yeah.

31:11.371 --> 31:13.331
So, when did you meet Danny?

31:13.414 --> 31:17.085
Around the time
that you were going to law school.

31:17.543 --> 31:18.795
Oh.

31:21.506 --> 31:23.674
He was really impressed.

31:25.551 --> 31:26.386
With me?

31:26.969 --> 31:28.721
Yeah, well, you know...

31:29.764 --> 31:31.432
he was glad you made it out of here,

31:31.516 --> 31:35.061
because only him and you
were the ones to do that.

31:36.270 --> 31:37.355
Well...

31:38.981 --> 31:40.400
I love it here.

31:40.942 --> 31:42.735
So, I came right back.

31:47.615 --> 31:48.866
I know...

31:50.493 --> 31:53.162
him and his dad had their issues, but...

31:54.163 --> 31:56.666
he told me it was roughest
for you growing up.

31:57.125 --> 31:58.876
Oh, Danny.

32:00.878 --> 32:03.339
He didn't know what he was talking about.

32:03.548 --> 32:06.384
Why, were you and Robert close?

32:07.718 --> 32:08.761
Yeah.

32:09.637 --> 32:11.180
I guess that explains it.

32:12.432 --> 32:14.016
That explains what?

32:14.142 --> 32:17.645
Why he made you the trustee of his estate.

32:20.022 --> 32:22.733
-How would you know that?
-Robert told me.

32:23.734 --> 32:26.070
I'm sorry, I don't understand

32:26.529 --> 32:29.532
the relationship that you have
with my father.

32:31.200 --> 32:32.618
Pretty simple.

32:32.702 --> 32:34.203
Danny got me pregnant.

32:34.287 --> 32:36.998
Your mom and I had a talk,

32:37.081 --> 32:40.585
and I kept the baby anyway.

32:42.253 --> 32:44.505
Then when your dad found out,

32:45.256 --> 32:49.427
he didn't want us to soil
the Rayburn name, so...

32:49.510 --> 32:51.762
he agreed to send me some money.

32:55.892 --> 32:57.143
Okay.

32:58.895 --> 33:00.938
What do you want from me, Eve?

33:05.067 --> 33:07.820
All these years, man. I've--

33:13.826 --> 33:16.454
I kept my end of the bargain, you know,

33:16.537 --> 33:20.666
and now your mom doesn't wanna honor it.

33:23.294 --> 33:24.837
Yeah, she told me.

33:25.505 --> 33:27.715
That's not her decision, is it?

33:28.925 --> 33:30.468
Because you're the trustee.

33:31.761 --> 33:32.595
Come on.

33:32.678 --> 33:33.804
You have to understand

33:33.888 --> 33:37.266
that I don't know anything about this deal

33:37.350 --> 33:39.769
you say you have with my dad, okay?

33:39.852 --> 33:41.854
Nobody does. There's no proof.

33:42.230 --> 33:43.356
Proof?

33:44.982 --> 33:48.569
The proof is Nolan

33:50.029 --> 33:52.365
and the payments that you stopped.

33:53.824 --> 33:56.285
Okay, well there's no legal documents.

33:56.369 --> 33:58.371
Well, what about Robert's will?

34:00.373 --> 34:04.293
-What about it?
-You like, drafted it for him, didn't you?

34:04.377 --> 34:07.129
Yeah. And Danny is not in it.

34:07.880 --> 34:12.718
Yeah, I know, but Robert said
Nolan would be in it.

34:16.806 --> 34:19.308
Okay, I don't know what my dad told you...

34:21.310 --> 34:22.645
but you can see for yourself,

34:22.728 --> 34:25.690
there is no mention of you
or your son anywhere.

34:28.067 --> 34:29.485
I'm really sorry.

35:53.944 --> 35:58.449
Excuse me. Excuse me.
Hey, sorry, I hate to bother you,

35:58.532 --> 36:02.328
but I'm here for the night
and I didn't plan ahead,

36:02.411 --> 36:05.748
and I'm looking if you can recommend
some local accommodations?

36:06.582 --> 36:08.042
What exactly you looking for?

36:09.335 --> 36:11.128
You know, to lock down some action.

36:12.088 --> 36:15.675
No, no, nothing shady. A little bit
of this, little bit of that.

36:15.883 --> 36:17.718
Can you hook me up?

36:18.386 --> 36:20.971
Head four miles south,
you'll find half a dozen good spots.

36:21.263 --> 36:22.848
Four miles-- Four miles south?

36:23.474 --> 36:25.184
Four miles south, that way.

36:25.309 --> 36:26.936
Oh, yeah.

36:27.770 --> 36:29.939
-Thank you. You've been a lifesaver.
-Uh-huh.

37:01.220 --> 37:03.055
Hey, hotshot.
You're coming to dinner tonight.

37:03.139 --> 37:04.724
Highly doubtful.

37:04.807 --> 37:07.309
Well, my wife doesn't take no
for an answer, so...

37:08.519 --> 37:10.479
Hey, why is she always
driving you around?

37:15.276 --> 37:16.777
None of your business.

37:19.947 --> 37:21.866
You really gonna be a father?

37:22.074 --> 37:23.200
Yeah.

37:25.828 --> 37:27.371
Good luck with that.

37:33.085 --> 37:36.839
Hey, moron, put the fucking cigarette out.
I'm serious, right now.

37:37.590 --> 37:40.134
There's gasoline and oil
all over the place here.

37:49.769 --> 37:52.438
Make sure your hand
is nice and high on the blade.

37:52.521 --> 37:54.398
You almost want it to claw.

37:54.482 --> 37:56.400
You can do it like this to start with.

37:56.484 --> 37:59.111
Just easy. All right?

37:59.195 --> 38:01.238
Why don't you take her for a spin.

38:02.281 --> 38:05.117
Okay, hand, remember?

38:05.493 --> 38:06.827
There it is. That's good.

38:08.120 --> 38:09.413
Yeah? There it is.

38:10.247 --> 38:12.666
Okay, that's good. Yeah, just gentle.

38:13.417 --> 38:16.086
-I'm always looking for a sous chef.
-Sous chef?

38:16.921 --> 38:18.214
The fuck is that?

38:18.422 --> 38:20.382
Like a second-in-command.

38:21.759 --> 38:24.094
That's good, turn them around.

38:25.095 --> 38:27.264
I wanna lay down some roots here.

38:29.225 --> 38:30.684
I'm gonna make this thing work.

38:37.316 --> 38:39.819
I mean it, you know,
I'm not going anywhere.

38:44.240 --> 38:45.616
That's good.

38:47.201 --> 38:49.161
Nolan, you got it.

38:50.371 --> 38:53.666
Shit. Shit, you're a natural.

38:57.670 --> 39:00.464
It does make allowances for grandchildren.

39:00.548 --> 39:03.509
It just doesn't say which grandchildren.

39:03.801 --> 39:06.846
If she were to take us to court,
she might have a case.

39:07.471 --> 39:09.807
Maybe we should just make
some kind of compromise?

39:10.558 --> 39:13.769
You know, if dad was paying her
all these years and...

39:14.562 --> 39:18.816
I don't know if what she's saying
about the will is true or not, but...

39:18.899 --> 39:21.277
if he wanted her to have something...

39:22.027 --> 39:23.696
it's worth talking about.

39:32.121 --> 39:34.874
We have a problem with Bungalow 3.

39:36.208 --> 39:38.210
The shower's not working again.

39:43.382 --> 39:45.384
Do you want me to call the plumber?

39:46.343 --> 39:49.096
I remember
when we originally laid that pipe.

39:50.931 --> 39:53.601
I always wondered
if they knew what they were doing.

39:56.270 --> 39:58.689
Mom, you okay?

40:00.816 --> 40:03.068
I want that woman to leave.

40:04.528 --> 40:07.364
She should take the boy
and go back to Miami.

40:20.711 --> 40:22.212
Can I talk to you a minute?

40:24.506 --> 40:26.967
-Ahem. Come on in, sit down.
-What's up?

40:28.928 --> 40:32.473
Yesterday, Eric O'Bannon,
why was he here?

40:33.724 --> 40:36.518
I'm just trying to fill in the blanks on--

40:36.602 --> 40:38.312
on Danny's murder. Why?

40:38.812 --> 40:40.564
Well, I mean you realize that Aguirre

40:40.648 --> 40:43.192
and all this political crap he's pulling,
I mean...

40:43.275 --> 40:46.195
keeping Danny's case open,
that's all for the press, right?

40:46.278 --> 40:49.949
Yeah, of course. I mean, I know that.
But I still have questions.

40:52.159 --> 40:53.619
What does that mean?

40:54.078 --> 40:57.665
Well, I mean,
why would Lowry admit

40:57.748 --> 41:00.960
to killing everybody else
other than Danny, huh?

41:01.043 --> 41:02.920
Think about that. Why?

41:03.003 --> 41:04.672
-Are you fucking kidding me?
-What--?

41:13.013 --> 41:14.306
You really wanna do this?

41:14.890 --> 41:16.350
Do I wanna do what?

41:17.434 --> 41:19.687
Look, I know Danny used
to work for Lowry,

41:19.770 --> 41:22.106
and that may have gotten him killed.

41:22.272 --> 41:23.524
But I also know

41:23.607 --> 41:27.069
that shit went down before Danny died
that you haven't told me about.

41:29.613 --> 41:31.907
-As a friend...
-Mm-hm.

41:32.825 --> 41:35.285
My family needs closure on this.

41:36.078 --> 41:37.788
I mean, it's-- It's time to move on.

41:38.122 --> 41:40.165
John, you know that's not my call.

41:41.208 --> 41:42.710
Well, now, listen...

41:43.460 --> 41:46.088
if you want to be a pawn
in Aguirre's bucket of bullshit,

41:46.171 --> 41:48.716
you go right ahead, but you can't
expect me to be part of that.

42:00.853 --> 42:03.022
Do me a favor and close the door
on the way out.

42:29.965 --> 42:31.592
Hey, hey, hey.

42:33.761 --> 42:35.054
What's happening?

42:36.597 --> 42:38.891
I think it's time
you found your own place.

42:40.726 --> 42:42.436
Are you fucking kidding me?

42:42.728 --> 42:44.855
I haven't been home in two months.

42:45.230 --> 42:46.607
Welcome home.

42:47.733 --> 42:49.193
You have until tomorrow.

42:49.735 --> 42:51.528
That's a nice way to treat family.

42:51.612 --> 42:53.197
Don't fucking try.

42:55.324 --> 42:57.284
What did the cops wanna talk
to you about?

42:57.367 --> 42:58.535
Danny.

42:58.619 --> 43:01.080
I heard they don't think Lowry killed him.

43:02.581 --> 43:03.499
Yeah.

43:05.042 --> 43:06.668
So, who do they think?

43:08.879 --> 43:10.672
I have no fucking clue.

43:12.466 --> 43:13.509
Look...

43:15.552 --> 43:18.138
when was the last time you two spoke,
you and Danny?

43:18.597 --> 43:20.933
The day that guy broke in here
looking for him.

43:21.308 --> 43:24.436
Okay, and that was it?
You didn't hear from him after that?

43:24.520 --> 43:25.687
No talking, nothing?

43:25.771 --> 43:28.440
Not really, no. I guess he texted me

43:28.524 --> 43:31.068
to tell me that he was gonna
take my car to Miami.

43:32.820 --> 43:35.823
-He text you before, ever?
-No.

43:41.829 --> 43:45.874
Danny wasn't a guy who really ever texted.

43:50.420 --> 43:54.550
Listen, Danny's dead, Lowry's dead.
I'm thankful that you're safe,

43:55.050 --> 43:56.885
but I can't live like this anymore.

43:59.221 --> 44:01.431
So, when I get home from work tomorrow,
I want you gone.

45:12.085 --> 45:13.420
I finished waxing.

45:16.131 --> 45:17.507
Cool. Um...

45:17.591 --> 45:20.719
Go ahead and start on Dr. Frank's whaler.

45:29.186 --> 45:30.979
Fuck.

45:38.070 --> 45:39.571
Fuck.

45:49.873 --> 45:53.210
Heh. Such are the seats of power.

45:53.293 --> 45:56.505
I can offer you coffee,
but don't ask for a cup.

45:59.549 --> 46:01.843
Your brother
is gonna get the tar beat out of him.

46:01.927 --> 46:03.303
You know that, right?

46:05.430 --> 46:09.017
I don't like what Aguirre's doing
to the Rayburn name.

46:09.101 --> 46:11.687
He wants everybody
to think of Danny when they hear it,

46:11.770 --> 46:13.397
not John.

46:14.022 --> 46:16.233
And certainly not your father.

46:17.734 --> 46:19.194
No.

46:19.653 --> 46:21.446
I didn't always get along with Robert.

46:21.530 --> 46:25.492
But I believed we shared
certain insight into human nature.

46:25.575 --> 46:26.743
Take a cop, for instance.

46:26.827 --> 46:29.204
That's someone with the need
to do the right thing,

46:29.287 --> 46:31.665
to make sure every particular
is properly managed,

46:31.748 --> 46:34.334
that everyone's taken care of.

46:36.545 --> 46:39.214
-What about a lawyer?
-Oh.

46:39.339 --> 46:44.344
I figure a lawyer's strength
is an ability to see the bigger picture.

46:44.428 --> 46:46.847
How the system really works,

46:46.930 --> 46:50.600
and then to do what's required.

46:52.019 --> 46:53.812
You want my money,

46:53.895 --> 46:55.522
my support?

46:58.650 --> 47:02.696
-We do.
-Prove to me you're worth the investment.

47:02.821 --> 47:04.489
Hit back at the sheriff.

47:05.490 --> 47:06.867
How do I do that?

47:07.325 --> 47:10.829
Oh, the Aguirre family's
had trouble of their own.

47:12.080 --> 47:14.916
Oh, no way. John will never go for it.

47:15.000 --> 47:17.377
If your brother wants to smile
and play nice,

47:17.461 --> 47:18.545
that's his business.

47:18.628 --> 47:20.756
Your job is to get him elected.

47:20.839 --> 47:23.383
Anything else is failure.

47:29.097 --> 47:32.893
My family has been through a lot,
Mr. Gilbert.

47:32.976 --> 47:35.854
And you are right about John.
Through it all,

47:36.480 --> 47:39.566
he has been the one constant
holding it all together.

47:40.442 --> 47:41.985
So, I appreciate you coming here.

47:42.069 --> 47:44.988
I respect your experience
and your insight.

47:45.655 --> 47:49.159
But my brother knows what he wants,
and we are going to do this John's way.

47:54.539 --> 47:56.124
Fair enough.

48:00.545 --> 48:03.799
John is quick to invoke your father.

48:03.882 --> 48:06.927
But he's not the one most like Robert.

48:20.273 --> 48:23.401
<i>♪ Don't you know</i>
<i>I need your love, babe? ♪</i>

48:23.568 --> 48:27.197
<i>♪ Don't you know</i>
<i>I want your love, baby? ♪</i>

48:28.698 --> 48:30.492
Here's your money, Dad.

48:32.661 --> 48:34.037
How did you pay?

48:34.121 --> 48:36.832
I didn't. Some guy wanted to pay for you.

48:36.915 --> 48:38.416
Who?

48:38.750 --> 48:40.127
Him.

48:40.627 --> 48:42.379
Afternoon.

48:45.215 --> 48:46.633
How y'all doing?

48:50.095 --> 48:51.805
-I appreciate this. I can't accept it.
-No.

48:51.888 --> 48:56.143
That's just a little thank-you
for your kind recommendation.

48:56.893 --> 48:58.937
-Good, so you found a place you like.
-I did, I did.

48:59.020 --> 49:01.356
And I wouldn't have found it
without your help, so thank you.

49:01.439 --> 49:02.858
Where you staying?

49:02.941 --> 49:04.568
Oh, oh, this cozy--

49:04.651 --> 49:08.363
This cozy little spot
called the Red Reef Inn.

49:08.655 --> 49:12.242
You ever been to the Red Reef Inn?

49:13.326 --> 49:15.328
Nope. Can't say as though I have.

49:15.412 --> 49:17.747
Oh, I'm staying in room number seven.
Lucky number seven.

49:17.831 --> 49:19.166
It's not much of a room,

49:19.249 --> 49:22.419
but, wow,
hell of a view, I'm telling you.

49:27.465 --> 49:29.092
I'm sorry, I didn't get your name.

49:29.176 --> 49:31.636
-Look, I'm taking up all your time.
-No. That's all right.

49:31.720 --> 49:33.722
I feel terrible.
Look, hey, enjoy your meal.

49:33.805 --> 49:35.849
Bon appétit, and all that.

49:43.440 --> 49:46.151
Hey, it's not happening, is it?

49:46.234 --> 49:48.612
-What's not happening?
-The shower. You said you'd fix it?

49:48.695 --> 49:50.864
Oh, no. It's all taken care of.

49:51.781 --> 49:53.909
-It should be working.
-It's not.

49:56.328 --> 49:57.913
We need to get cleaned up
and meet some friends,

49:57.996 --> 49:59.956
so maybe you could put us
in another room?

50:00.415 --> 50:02.042
Oh, God. I'm--

50:02.125 --> 50:06.379
Mr. Ward, I am so sorry,
but tonight we are completely booked up.

50:06.463 --> 50:09.799
Okay, then, why don't you just give us
the name of another place.

50:11.092 --> 50:13.470
Of course. I'm so sorry.

50:13.553 --> 50:15.388
Mr. Ward.

50:15.472 --> 50:17.807
I wanna make this right.

50:50.257 --> 50:51.591
Hi.

50:52.092 --> 50:53.468
Hey.

50:56.805 --> 51:00.100
Look, I figured I owed you the heads-up.

51:00.183 --> 51:02.394
The department's
still investigating Danny.

51:02.477 --> 51:04.187
Yeah, I know. John told me.

51:04.271 --> 51:05.689
Yeah.

51:06.940 --> 51:08.191
So, I'll be in touch.

51:08.275 --> 51:11.820
I may have to bring you in
for some more questioning, okay?

51:15.740 --> 51:17.701
Okay, sure.

51:17.993 --> 51:19.577
Whatever you need.

51:21.997 --> 51:23.915
So, you're really back now?

51:25.875 --> 51:27.335
Yeah.

51:29.170 --> 51:31.256
Do you wanna come in
for a drink or something?

51:31.840 --> 51:33.300
No.

51:33.633 --> 51:35.093
Okay.

51:42.225 --> 51:44.644
I'm really sorry about the other night.

51:44.728 --> 51:46.313
I was drunk.

51:46.396 --> 51:49.024
-And I was an asshole. I really--
-No, it doesn't matter.

51:49.107 --> 51:50.567
It doesn't matter.

51:54.029 --> 51:56.406
Nothing like that happens again,
all right?

51:57.866 --> 52:00.201
Yeah. It won't.

52:28.688 --> 52:31.274
So, how do you like
working at the boat yard?

52:33.443 --> 52:35.028
It's okay, I guess.

52:35.111 --> 52:36.654
My boss won't let me smoke.

52:41.951 --> 52:43.620
I hope you get a good night's sleep.

52:44.079 --> 52:47.874
Tomorrow, I'm gonna put him
on Harley Middleton's <i>Sundancer.</i>

52:48.917 --> 52:51.294
I don't understand why I have to
clean the bottom of the boat

52:51.378 --> 52:53.546
if it's gonna be in the water anyway.

52:53.922 --> 52:56.132
It seems like a pretty stupid thing to do.

52:57.342 --> 53:00.678
It makes it run smoother, genius.

53:03.264 --> 53:04.099
Really?

53:05.892 --> 53:07.685
Even I didn't know that.

53:08.311 --> 53:10.772
Boat runs smoother, uses less fuel.

53:10.980 --> 53:12.524
Oh.

53:48.852 --> 53:50.353
Hi.

53:50.437 --> 53:53.148
I was hoping we could talk again.

53:58.987 --> 54:00.321
You want some more lemonade?

54:00.405 --> 54:02.115
No, thanks.

54:08.955 --> 54:11.374
You know what I could really go for?

54:11.458 --> 54:12.584
A shot of tequila.

54:16.796 --> 54:19.090
You wanna join me, Uncle Kev?

54:23.052 --> 54:28.057
Wait, you're a few years away
from a shot of tequila.

54:28.141 --> 54:32.187
Besides, neither of us is
doing any drinking these days.

54:32.270 --> 54:34.272
Oh, I didn't know that.

54:37.275 --> 54:38.568
Huh.

54:46.951 --> 54:50.205
I got something important
I think I ought to say.

54:54.918 --> 54:56.336
Yeah?

54:57.337 --> 54:58.296
What's that?

55:02.217 --> 55:04.844
I know I remind you of my dad.

55:07.305 --> 55:09.349
And it sucks.

55:10.850 --> 55:14.812
So, maybe you could give me
a break, okay?

55:19.442 --> 55:21.778
Maybe I can come back sometime?

55:22.904 --> 55:26.950
Yeah. You can come back
anytime you wanna come back.

55:27.033 --> 55:29.619
You know,
I'd love to see things in action.

55:30.161 --> 55:35.041
Well, Fridays, Saturdays,
they're their best nights. They're--

55:50.181 --> 55:52.267
No more excuses.

57:13.514 --> 57:16.267
I didn't expect to hear from you again.

57:16.351 --> 57:17.685
We keep John out of this?

57:19.687 --> 57:21.397
Of course.

57:30.615 --> 57:32.492
Ain't nobody staying in room seven.

57:32.575 --> 57:34.661
When did the last person check out?

57:35.411 --> 57:40.249
Shit, we haven't had no one stay in seven
since the murder. You know about that?

57:42.460 --> 57:44.253
Listen, the last couple of days,

57:44.337 --> 57:47.966
you see any guy around here
about 140 pounds, 5'9", dark hair?

57:49.092 --> 57:53.846
Only new guests we had this week
was a couple of college girls.

57:56.724 --> 57:58.810
You got a key to room seven?

57:59.185 --> 58:01.562
So, if the cops are still looking,

58:01.646 --> 58:04.399
then they must not think
Lowry did it, right?

58:04.607 --> 58:08.111
I'm telling you this detective brother
is getting curiouser and curiouser.

58:08.194 --> 58:10.780
John's a fucking prick,
but he acts like a Boy Scout.

58:10.863 --> 58:12.699
Oh, I seen this type before.

58:12.782 --> 58:15.326
The whole family is a bunch
of self-righteous fucking do-gooders.

58:15.410 --> 58:18.371
That's bullshit. Bullshit.
They paid a girl to get rid of a kid.

58:18.454 --> 58:21.916
Come on, the whole family's
a bunch of fucking liars.

58:55.074 --> 58:59.287
After all the shit went down
at the motel, you're sure, right?

58:59.370 --> 59:03.249
The kid, Eve,
they never saw Danny up in Miami, right?

59:05.168 --> 59:09.839
All I know is Danny told me he was coming,
and then he never showed.

59:36.407 --> 59:38.493
I need to know...

59:39.410 --> 59:42.080
that my family's gonna be safe.

1:00:19.075 --> 1:00:20.993
You wanna know what I think?

1:00:21.536 --> 1:00:22.912
What?

1:00:24.664 --> 1:00:27.125
I bet you start pressing John Rayburn,

1:00:27.208 --> 1:00:29.877
and all sorts of shit starts spilling out.

1:00:39.971 --> 1:00:41.139
He still there?
