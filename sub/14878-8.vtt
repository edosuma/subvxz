00:17.634 --> 00:19.034
Look, we're not gonna bust you

00:19.035 --> 00:20.469
If you say you're a... Call girl.

00:20.470 --> 00:21.837
We don't like to use that term.

00:21.838 --> 00:23.139
Ben mercer-- we move too quickly,

00:23.140 --> 00:24.340
He could slip away again.

00:24.341 --> 00:25.674
Ep the girl working,
keep her out there,

00:25.675 --> 00:26.976
And let's see what he does.

00:26.977 --> 00:28.411
Hopefully, she'll
lead us right to him.

00:28.412 --> 00:30.112
- Let him go, annie.
- You're right.

00:30.113 --> 00:32.046
It's stupid. It's time to move on.

00:33.150 --> 00:34.650
- Hassan's down.
- Who fired the shot?

00:34.651 --> 00:36.252
The order was to take him alive.

00:36.253 --> 00:38.320
Who fired?

00:52.202 --> 00:53.702
Drop the weapon!

00:53.703 --> 00:55.738
Drop it now! Get on the ground!

00:55.739 --> 00:57.273
I didn't-- I don't--

00:57.274 --> 00:59.808
Put the gun down.

01:01.645 --> 01:05.013
Move away from the
weapon and lie facedown.

01:13.757 --> 01:15.724
I just heard.

01:15.725 --> 01:17.259
Where is she? The bureau's got her?

01:17.260 --> 01:19.228
Yes. See, this is
what happens, arthur.

01:19.229 --> 01:21.464
You put annie in harm's way,
she gets harmed.

01:21.465 --> 01:22.865
Was mercer involved?

01:22.866 --> 01:25.501
Do I need to authorize an ops team?

01:25.502 --> 01:28.304
I have an operative
in federal custody,

01:28.305 --> 01:30.239
One who's lucky to be alive.

01:30.240 --> 01:32.041
We can talk about
you and your agenda

01:32.042 --> 01:33.976
When I get her back here safely.

01:52.229 --> 01:54.696
I know you.

01:59.669 --> 02:03.472
Let's see, you're not
dressed like a call girl.

02:03.473 --> 02:06.175
Who do you work for today?

02:06.176 --> 02:08.443
- The smithsonia
- do you, now?

02:15.685 --> 02:19.388
We can do the "he said,
she said" back-and-forth thing

02:19.389 --> 02:21.857
When I get back.

02:37.507 --> 02:45.581
* *

03:08.838 --> 03:10.639
I'm not gonna like this, am I?

03:10.640 --> 03:13.275
- Girl's lawyer is here.
- Her lawyer?

03:13.276 --> 03:14.677
You mean the one she didn't call,

03:14.678 --> 03:17.246
Because we didn't let
her call anybody yet?

03:17.247 --> 03:20.149
- That's her.
- Yeah, I got it.

03:20.150 --> 03:22.718
I'd like to speak
with my client, alone.

03:22.719 --> 03:24.853
Your client.

03:24.854 --> 03:28.123
She's as much your client
as this is my gavel.

03:28.124 --> 03:30.859
Just understand that we expect

03:30.860 --> 03:35.063
A little interagency
communication and support.

03:38.301 --> 03:41.503
Right this way.

03:43.106 --> 03:44.740
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

03:50.413 --> 03:52.748
I said I was your lawyer.

03:52.749 --> 03:54.617
Did they buy it?

03:54.618 --> 03:56.418
No.

03:56.419 --> 03:58.120
But you might as well
treat me like one,

03:58.121 --> 03:59.855
Because it's gonna
be the same advice.

03:59.856 --> 04:02.758
You're sitting in a federal
interrogation room, annie.

04:02.759 --> 04:04.393
Why?

04:04.394 --> 04:05.628
I-I-- I didn't--

04:05.629 --> 04:07.096
A blanket denial

04:07.097 --> 04:09.231
Is not gonna get you anywhere
with them or with me.

04:09.232 --> 04:13.302
I'm looking for a detailed,
moment-by-moment explanation.

04:13.303 --> 04:16.105
I've been trying
to work it through.

04:16.106 --> 04:19.241
Right. So you're confused,
maybe in shock?

04:19.242 --> 04:20.942
I understand.

04:20.944 --> 04:22.845
So let's just work
through it together.

04:22.846 --> 04:26.215
Take a deep breath and
start at the beginning.

04:26.216 --> 04:27.783
Two days ago,

04:27.784 --> 04:29.184
I attended an auction at bramble's

04:29.185 --> 04:32.084
As part of my smithsonian cover.

04:32.085 --> 04:33.589
Do I hear $500,000?

04:33.590 --> 04:35.257
Thank you, ma'am. $500,000.

04:35.258 --> 04:39.962
Do I hear $750,000? $750,000?

04:39.963 --> 04:42.698
Sir, $750,000. Thank you.

04:42.699 --> 04:46.168
Do I hear $1 million? $1 million?

04:46.169 --> 04:47.636
Thank you. Do I hear...

04:47.637 --> 04:49.672
Bidding on the, uh, velvet elvis?

04:49.673 --> 04:51.507
Oh. I hear the
brushwork's amazing.

04:51.508 --> 04:54.243
Yeah. I'm holding out
on the dogs playing poker.

04:54.244 --> 04:55.411
There's a dogs playing poker?

04:55.412 --> 04:56.612
I'll have to add that to my list.

04:56.613 --> 04:58.814
- You bidding on multiple lots?
- Yeah.

04:58.815 --> 05:00.649
My resources are pretty good.

05:00.650 --> 05:02.217
Funded corporate viper.

05:02.218 --> 05:05.320
We private buyers don't
really care for your kind.

05:05.321 --> 05:07.156
Just don't go for
the piece I'm after.

05:07.157 --> 05:09.858
You better hope not.

05:09.859 --> 05:12.861
Fair warning and...

05:12.862 --> 05:14.697
Sold for $5.75 million.

05:14.698 --> 05:16.532
Thank you, ma'am.

05:16.533 --> 05:18.233
The renoir is now
closed for bidding.

05:18.234 --> 05:21.003
Next up is lot 33,

05:21.004 --> 05:25.271
<i>Thomas cole's 1832 painting
a wild scene.</i>

05:25.272 --> 05:29.285
We'll open bidding,
please, at $1.5 million.

05:29.286 --> 05:30.713
$1.5 million.

05:30.714 --> 05:32.081
Thank you, sir.

05:32.082 --> 05:34.450
Do I hear $1.75 million?

05:34.451 --> 05:36.385
$1.75 million.

05:36.386 --> 05:38.053
Thank you. Do I hear 2--

05:38.054 --> 05:39.488
$2 million?

05:39.489 --> 05:41.256
$2 million. Thank you very much.

05:41.257 --> 05:42.391
Do I hear 2.25?

05:42.392 --> 05:44.993
Don't look at me.

05:44.994 --> 05:46.829
$2.25 million, sir?

05:46.830 --> 05:49.765
Thank you. Do I hear 2.5?

05:49.766 --> 05:52.067
2.5? $2.5 million.

05:52.068 --> 05:54.503
Thank you. Do I hear 2.75?

05:54.504 --> 05:56.338
2.75?

05:56.339 --> 05:58.240
Two and three-quarter million dollars-
thank you very much.

05:58.241 --> 06:01.543
Do I hear 3-- $3 million?

06:01.544 --> 06:03.212
$3 million, sir.
Thank you very much.

06:03.213 --> 06:06.749
Do I hear 3.25? 3.25?

06:06.750 --> 06:09.218
$10 million.

06:09.219 --> 06:12.454
$10 million.

06:15.041 --> 06:18.677
Ladies and gentlemen,
do I hear 10.1?

06:18.678 --> 06:21.113
$10.1 million?

06:21.114 --> 06:23.649
Very well. Fair warning, and...

06:23.650 --> 06:25.985
sold for $10 million.

06:25.986 --> 06:27.453
Thank you.

06:27.454 --> 06:29.321
The cole is now closed for bidding.

06:30.690 --> 06:32.324
That was a gross overbid.

06:39.432 --> 06:41.400
Excuse me, miss jacklin? - Yes.

06:41.401 --> 06:44.136
Who was the man that
bought the cole painting?

06:44.137 --> 06:46.372
I-I'm sorry. We can't
release personal information.

06:46.373 --> 06:48.307
Our bidders value their privacy.

06:48.308 --> 06:49.775
I understand,
but let me ask you--

06:49.776 --> 06:51.510
Wasn't that bid a
little outrageous?

06:51.511 --> 06:53.178
I think if you
can pay outrageous,

06:53.179 --> 06:54.513
You can buy outrageous.

06:54.514 --> 06:55.948
This happens from time to time.

06:55.949 --> 06:57.883
- Yeah, but the-
- the painting was not worth that.

06:57.884 --> 06:59.752
Apparently, it was.

06:59.753 --> 07:01.186
Excuse me.

07:08.294 --> 07:11.096
- August.
- Ann.

07:11.097 --> 07:14.266
So if we see something that
we don't think feels right,

07:14.267 --> 07:16.168
The company wants us
to report it, right,

07:16.169 --> 07:17.936
No matter how ridiculous?

07:17.937 --> 07:19.371
Encourages it, in fact. Why?

07:19.372 --> 07:21.974
You see your gardener
buying too much fertilizer?

07:21.975 --> 07:24.510
Somebody wanted me
to watch a certain lot

07:24.511 --> 07:25.811
At bramble's this morning.

07:25.812 --> 07:27.546
They even circled it
on my lot schedule.

07:27.547 --> 07:28.947
And...?

07:28.948 --> 07:31.383
And the piece sold for
way more than it was worth.

07:31.384 --> 07:32.685
How much more?

07:32.686 --> 07:34.687
$6, maybe $7 million.

07:34.688 --> 07:36.522
File a civ ob.

07:36.523 --> 07:39.458
May tick something in the server.

07:39.459 --> 07:41.026
Civilian observation-- right.

07:41.027 --> 07:43.228
File a civ ob,
catch the unabomber.

07:43.229 --> 07:45.230
Or a stupid art collector

07:45.231 --> 07:48.233
Who pays too much for a painting.

07:50.003 --> 07:52.371
Hey. We still on for tonight?

07:52.372 --> 07:56.709
Sure. But just to clarify,
it's just a family barbecue--

07:56.710 --> 07:58.644
Paper plates and paper napkins.

07:58.645 --> 08:01.413
I totally understand
what you're trying to say.

08:02.882 --> 08:06.184
I'll dress casually.

08:11.825 --> 08:14.059
So she was working
at the smithsonian

08:14.060 --> 08:15.594
When you met her?

08:15.595 --> 08:16.995
I- I'm confused. - Not exactly.

08:16.996 --> 08:18.731
I wasn't at work. I was, uh...

08:18.732 --> 08:21.100
Actually, we met at a
coffee shop near her work.

08:21.101 --> 08:23.969
So... What is it you do, jai?

08:23.970 --> 08:28.207
Ann says that you're some
kind of a g-man or something.

08:28.208 --> 08:30.843
I think that usually
means the fbi.

08:30.844 --> 08:33.779
No, I'm-- I'm just a suit-and-tie
man for the state department.

08:33.780 --> 08:36.715
I, uh, have a number
instead of a name at work.

08:44.390 --> 08:45.290
- Oh!
- Ugh!

08:47.127 --> 08:49.027
Oh, my god.

08:49.028 --> 08:51.563
He's, like, the george clooney
of wherever he's from.

08:51.564 --> 08:54.700
Nice. He's actually
third generation d.C.

08:54.701 --> 08:56.802
But that bone
structure is ridiculous.

08:56.803 --> 08:58.837
Okay, you're making
me self-conscious here.

08:58.838 --> 09:00.272
Oh, come on, you're one
of the beautiful people too,

09:00.273 --> 09:01.774
Which is why it works.

09:01.775 --> 09:03.942
Is it serious? - I don't know.

09:03.943 --> 09:06.178
I haven't been on
a date in a while.

09:06.179 --> 09:08.247
Aha. Finally, she admits it.

09:08.248 --> 09:09.982
It's a barbecue date.

09:09.983 --> 09:11.950
It's not a serious date

09:11.951 --> 09:14.319
If everyone has hickory
sauce on their chins.

09:14.320 --> 09:16.421
Oh, come on, you can tell
if has potential or not.

09:16.422 --> 09:19.591
I'm not too much of a mom.
I remember new romance...

09:19.592 --> 09:21.360
Sort of.

09:22.662 --> 09:23.962
That was fun...

09:24.931 --> 09:26.431
As far as barbecues go,

09:26.432 --> 09:28.834
With paper napkins.

09:28.835 --> 09:31.403
- And paper plates?
- Mm.

09:31.404 --> 09:34.173
Dates are so much fancier.
They are.

09:34.174 --> 09:37.910
I appreciate the
lack of pressure.

09:37.911 --> 09:40.813
And I appreciate
the understanding.

09:40.814 --> 09:43.549
We've all had relationships
that take time to get over.

09:43.550 --> 09:45.317
Are you talking about me?

09:45.318 --> 09:47.953
You're a little gun-shy...

09:47.954 --> 09:50.389
A lot gun-shy.

09:50.390 --> 09:53.158
I guess I am.

09:53.159 --> 09:54.726
All I'm saying
is I've been there.

09:54.727 --> 09:57.062
If you want to take your time,
take your time.

09:57.063 --> 09:59.131
I'm around.

09:59.132 --> 10:01.666
There's nothing I like
more than a good barbecue.

10:14.380 --> 10:16.548
Hello, annie.

10:17.684 --> 10:19.618
Ben.

10:23.645 --> 10:25.846
I'm not sure whether I, uh...

10:25.847 --> 10:27.781
Apologize first for
leaving you in sri lanka

10:27.782 --> 10:28.982
Or...

10:28.983 --> 10:30.484
Breaking into your home.

10:30.485 --> 10:33.087
Sri lanka.

10:33.088 --> 10:35.823
Leaving you was the hardest
thing I ever had to do.

10:35.824 --> 10:37.991
"had to"?

10:45.500 --> 10:48.769
You changed things for me, annie.

10:48.770 --> 10:50.604
And you left me.

10:50.605 --> 10:53.107
I was in love with you,

10:53.108 --> 10:55.309
And you skipped out with a note.

10:55.310 --> 10:57.544
If I would have
stayed any longer,

10:57.545 --> 10:59.012
You would have been in danger.
From what?

10:59.013 --> 11:01.115
My mission.

11:01.116 --> 11:03.050
I was with the agency.

11:03.051 --> 11:06.453
I knew it.

11:06.454 --> 11:09.022
With stas on the train tracks...

11:10.291 --> 11:12.359
It was you who saved me.

11:14.362 --> 11:17.030
I was tracking him.

11:17.031 --> 11:19.133
I'm on my own now.

11:19.134 --> 11:21.969
A-and somehow that's
my responsibility?

11:21.970 --> 11:24.738
I was in love with you, annie.

11:24.739 --> 11:25.906
That was it.

11:25.907 --> 11:27.908
I thought so long

11:27.909 --> 11:31.979
About what I would say to
you if I ever saw you again,

11:31.980 --> 11:34.381
And now I realize I
don't want to talk.

11:34.382 --> 11:37.651
<i>I want you to talk.
Why are you here? Now?</i>

11:37.652 --> 11:40.454
The cole painting at the auction.

11:40.455 --> 11:42.256
You marked it on my program.

11:42.257 --> 11:43.791
There's more there.

11:43.792 --> 11:46.794
Keep digging. Just push it hard.

11:46.795 --> 11:50.798
What kind of cryptic
nonsense is that?

11:50.799 --> 11:54.968
You show up two years
later out of the blue,

11:54.969 --> 11:58.572
And you expect me
to "push it hard"?

11:58.573 --> 12:00.474
You push it hard.

12:00.475 --> 12:02.843
I don't believe you.

12:02.844 --> 12:06.213
There's an arms dealer...

12:06.214 --> 12:08.182
Seref murat.

12:08.183 --> 12:10.984
The auction is one of the
ways he moves his money.

12:10.985 --> 12:12.986
That's why that
guy overbid so much.

12:12.987 --> 12:15.355
Murat's number two, russ hilburn.

12:15.356 --> 12:18.892
He wasn't just buying a
thomas cole painting.

12:18.893 --> 12:20.861
He was buying a cole and schematics

12:20.862 --> 12:22.930
For a russian
missile-guidance system.

12:22.931 --> 12:25.799
That doesn't make sense.
The cia would want to stop that.

12:25.800 --> 12:27.267
- Why--
- they want to control it.

12:27.268 --> 12:28.969
They want to control him.

12:28.970 --> 12:30.637
I want to stop murat.

12:30.638 --> 12:34.007
So just to be clear...

12:34.008 --> 12:38.212
You're not asking for forgiveness.

12:38.213 --> 12:41.214
You're asking me for a favor.

12:44.319 --> 12:46.687
What do you want me do to?

12:46.688 --> 12:48.655
Go to sophie jacklin,
the bramble's director.

12:48.656 --> 12:53.493
Ask her about February 22nd,
lots 19 and 75.

12:53.494 --> 12:54.895
It may take some coaxing,

12:54.896 --> 12:57.231
But I think she'll come
into langley with you.

12:57.232 --> 12:59.900
And if you have to use my name,
you use it.

12:59.901 --> 13:01.668
- You know her?
- Call her mona lisa,

13:01.669 --> 13:04.204
And she'll know
you're not bluffing.

13:04.205 --> 13:05.472
No.

13:05.473 --> 13:07.541
Annie...

13:07.542 --> 13:09.943
I know this is a lot to take in.

13:09.944 --> 13:12.846
- The cia--
- forget protocol.

13:12.847 --> 13:16.583
The agency is using
you to get to me.

13:16.584 --> 13:19.119
You can't believe
anything they say about me

13:19.120 --> 13:20.587
Or anything I've done.

13:20.588 --> 13:24.157
Do not trust joan and arthur.

13:28.296 --> 13:30.464
Maybe I don't deserve this,

13:30.465 --> 13:33.700
But I'm asking you to trust me.

13:33.701 --> 13:36.736
Trust the man you fell in
love with in sri lanka.

14:13.141 --> 14:14.841
Uh-oh. I know that sound.

14:14.842 --> 14:16.910
Access denied.

14:16.911 --> 14:20.948
Someone's gonna throw a net
over you in five, four...

14:20.949 --> 14:23.684
Three... - Har har.

14:23.685 --> 14:25.786
I mock your attempt at humor.

14:25.787 --> 14:27.721
What, are you looking
for kennedy's assassin?

14:27.722 --> 14:29.323
Just blown password.

14:29.324 --> 14:31.825
I'm checking on
some stuff for joan.

14:34.262 --> 14:37.197
Careful. The walls around
here have eyes and ears.

14:37.198 --> 14:40.700
Try to avoid major felonies.

14:53.848 --> 14:55.549
damn password.

14:55.550 --> 14:57.484
at least turn down

14:57.485 --> 14:59.653
Your speakers.

15:05.626 --> 15:07.728
Who called your
attention to the auction?

15:07.729 --> 15:09.596
Sophie jacklin.

15:09.597 --> 15:12.265
She called me yesterday morning.

15:12.266 --> 15:13.633
And what did she
say on the phone?

15:13.634 --> 15:16.470
That she needed to see me, alone.

15:16.471 --> 15:18.171
Excuse me!

15:19.240 --> 15:20.774
Excuse me.

15:22.310 --> 15:23.577
We're closed.

15:23.578 --> 15:26.179
I-I need to speak
to miss jacklin.

15:33.154 --> 15:35.022
Sorry. I- I haven't much time.

15:35.023 --> 15:37.290
- I'm annie walker.
- From the smithsonian, yes.

15:37.291 --> 15:39.826
You were upset about the
price of the cole painting.

15:39.827 --> 15:41.995
It was exorbitant.

15:41.996 --> 15:45.165
Like I told you, you know,
people have their reasons.

15:45.166 --> 15:47.267
I can't really guess why someone
might bid what they bid.

15:47.268 --> 15:49.836
What about February 22nd,

15:49.837 --> 15:53.873
Lots 19 and 75?

15:55.643 --> 15:59.679
May I see your
credentials, please?

16:03.451 --> 16:05.919
I need another 15 minutes.

16:05.920 --> 16:09.389
Yeah, well, make them wait.
Something urgent's come up.

16:09.390 --> 16:11.891
In my office. Yeah.

16:13.461 --> 16:15.195
So, um...

16:15.196 --> 16:19.666
Lots 19 and 75 on...

16:19.667 --> 16:21.434
Was that the 22nd of February?

16:21.435 --> 16:23.003
Don't play games with me.

16:23.004 --> 16:25.605
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

16:25.606 --> 16:28.441
Do you want me to mention murat?

16:28.442 --> 16:31.177
Maybe you should show me
your other credentials now.

16:31.178 --> 16:34.047
Fbi? Interpol?

16:34.048 --> 16:36.249
Well, you can't be cia.

16:36.250 --> 16:37.817
What makes you say that?

16:37.818 --> 16:40.553
Because they would
have sent someone else.

16:42.056 --> 16:44.791
So tell me, annie walker,

16:44.792 --> 16:48.027
Who the hell are you?

16:52.914 --> 16:55.949
I'm not here to
arrest you or kill you

16:55.950 --> 16:58.285
Or whatever you think.

16:58.286 --> 17:00.020
Put the gun down.

17:00.021 --> 17:01.855
Oh, you just happen
to be interested

17:01.856 --> 17:03.357
In those particular lots.

17:03.358 --> 17:05.224
I know about murat's deals

17:05.226 --> 17:07.227
And hilburn making
the transactions.

17:07.228 --> 17:09.496
That was him at the auction,
wasn't it?

17:09.497 --> 17:12.332
- You must think I'm naive.
- I was sent here to help you.

17:12.333 --> 17:13.767
By whom?

17:13.768 --> 17:17.704
You haven't told me anything yet.

17:17.704 --> 17:20.707
I was sent by ben mercer.

17:20.708 --> 17:23.377
Ben's dead.

17:23.377 --> 17:26.780
I saw him last night.

17:26.781 --> 17:28.348
I don't believe you.

17:28.348 --> 17:30.951
Believe me, mona lisa.

17:38.760 --> 17:40.794
Who was he to you?

17:40.795 --> 17:42.396
He didn't tell you?

17:42.397 --> 17:45.666
Ben has many secrets.

17:45.667 --> 17:48.502
He was my contact at the agency.

17:48.503 --> 17:52.072
He was the operative who
first approached me.

17:52.073 --> 17:55.409
I facilitated certain
financial transactions

17:55.410 --> 17:57.010
For the company,

17:57.011 --> 17:58.745
Similar to what I do
for hilburn and murat.

17:58.746 --> 18:03.050
Ben made me feel safe, protected.

18:03.051 --> 18:05.018
When they told me
that he'd been killed,

18:05.019 --> 18:06.453
It wasn't the same anymore.

18:06.454 --> 18:08.322
I felt exposed.

18:08.323 --> 18:10.157
You started double dealing.

18:10.158 --> 18:13.160
No, I-I was having
some financial troubles,

18:13.161 --> 18:16.530
And russ hilburn's money
looked awfully good.

18:16.531 --> 18:19.466
So why...

18:19.467 --> 18:22.436
Why didn't ben come himself?

18:22.437 --> 18:26.106
Ben's in a complicated situation.

18:26.107 --> 18:28.909
A- and so are you.

18:28.910 --> 18:30.210
It's the russians

18:30.211 --> 18:31.878
Who are selling the
plans to murat, right?

18:31.879 --> 18:33.647
I don't know anything
about any plans.

18:33.648 --> 18:34.881
They don't tell me.

18:34.882 --> 18:36.650
That's not gonna hold up

18:36.651 --> 18:38.685
When they start handing
out indictments

18:38.686 --> 18:40.320
Or when murat and hilburn decide

18:40.321 --> 18:43.423
That you're the one
causing this problem.

18:43.424 --> 18:44.691
They'll kill me.

18:44.692 --> 18:45.892
But they won't have the chance

18:45.893 --> 18:47.828
If you come with me to langley now

18:47.829 --> 18:50.597
And tell us what you know.

18:50.598 --> 18:52.866
We have to hurry.

18:52.867 --> 18:54.935
Um, hilburn's men
are on their way now

18:54.936 --> 18:56.436
To pick up the painting.

18:56.437 --> 18:58.672
That's who you were
with on the phone?

18:58.673 --> 19:00.507
If you're here when
they arrive, they--

19:00.508 --> 19:02.409
Look, they're not the kind of men

19:02.410 --> 19:04.411
To waste time asking questions.

19:07.015 --> 19:10.183
There's a side exit
through the warehouse.

19:10.184 --> 19:12.619
You always pack that much heat?

19:12.620 --> 19:14.187
I don't even know if it works.

19:14.188 --> 19:16.857
I guess what you
said about hilburn...

19:16.858 --> 19:18.091
It's not the first time

19:18.092 --> 19:19.926
I thought about what
they might do to me.

19:19.927 --> 19:21.194
Hello, sophie.

19:21.195 --> 19:23.096
Something wrong?

19:23.097 --> 19:26.099
The cole is waiting
for you in receiving.

19:26.100 --> 19:27.601
You are supposed to be alone.

19:27.602 --> 19:30.871
This is a friend of mine-- annie.

19:30.872 --> 19:32.406
She dropped by. - Which is why

19:32.407 --> 19:34.808
You're hurrying out with your gun.

19:34.809 --> 19:37.844
I've never seen you with a weapon.

19:37.845 --> 19:40.714
Look, this must be some
kind of misunderstanding.

19:40.715 --> 19:43.149
Miss jacklin?

19:44.118 --> 19:45.819
Go, go, go!

20:31.599 --> 20:34.200
The loading dock's
through that way.

20:37.305 --> 20:39.906
Hey, do you want this? - , keep it.

20:39.907 --> 20:42.008
Keep moving towards the dock.

21:57.218 --> 21:59.285
Aah!

22:11.165 --> 22:12.565
It works.

22:56.955 --> 22:58.722
Drop the weapon!

22:58.723 --> 23:00.724
Drop it now! Get on the ground!

23:00.725 --> 23:02.259
I didn't-- I don't--

23:02.260 --> 23:04.594
Put the gun down.

23:06.798 --> 23:10.100
Step away from the
weapon and lie facedown.

23:14.505 --> 23:16.974
Sophie jacklin tipped
you to the overbid

23:16.975 --> 23:18.275
And then denied anything was wrong

23:18.276 --> 23:19.609
When you approached her afterwards?

23:19.610 --> 23:21.511
Sh-- she was worried
she was being watched.

23:21.512 --> 23:23.914
- She told you that.
- When she called me...

23:23.915 --> 23:25.615
Yesterday morning.

23:25.616 --> 23:27.551
And what did she
say on the phone?

23:27.552 --> 23:29.653
That she needed to see me, alone.

23:29.654 --> 23:31.288
So she knew who you worked for.

23:31.289 --> 23:32.723
She didn't say,

23:32.724 --> 23:36.559
Only that she had information
for me about the buyer.

23:53.911 --> 23:56.279
What'd it say?

23:56.280 --> 23:58.215
Confirms two men at your shootout

23:58.216 --> 23:59.816
Were turkish, foreign nationals,

23:59.817 --> 24:03.486
Which is why you're in
federal custody, not state.

24:18.269 --> 24:19.736
Find anything yet?

24:19.737 --> 24:21.471
I'm in the middle of it now.

24:21.472 --> 24:23.340
She deleted her history,
tried to cover her tracks.

24:23.341 --> 24:24.674
On a civ ob?

24:24.675 --> 24:27.010
It's not like annie
to work off book.

24:27.011 --> 24:29.880
So ms. Jacklin took
you back to her office

24:29.881 --> 24:31.481
And told you the buyer was paying

24:31.482 --> 24:35.185
For more than just a thomas cole.

24:35.186 --> 24:36.920
The only reason you you hesitate

24:36.921 --> 24:38.522
Is because you're
trying to handle me.

24:38.523 --> 24:40.924
You do that, and you lose, annie,

24:40.925 --> 24:44.361
Because I am much,
much better at this than you.

24:44.362 --> 24:46.163
Just answer. What did she say?

24:46.164 --> 24:48.398
It was a money exchange

24:48.399 --> 24:50.834
For schematics for a russian
missile-guidance system.

24:50.835 --> 24:53.470
If the russians were the sellers,
who were the turks?

24:53.471 --> 24:55.305
Who was it that overbid
for the cole painting?

24:55.306 --> 24:58.175
She didn't say.

24:58.176 --> 24:59.643
She didn't say. Really?

24:59.644 --> 25:02.546
After being such a
fountain of information.

25:02.547 --> 25:04.781
Sophie jacklin was a cia asset.

25:04.782 --> 25:06.516
She had been for six years.

25:06.517 --> 25:09.252
Did she bother, after all that,

25:09.253 --> 25:11.621
Telling you why she didn't
contact her regular handler?

25:11.622 --> 25:13.123
No, ma'am.

25:13.124 --> 25:15.092
Did she tell you who
her first handler was?

25:15.093 --> 25:17.761
No, ma'am, she didn't.

26:01.372 --> 26:03.240
Haven't got much here.

26:03.241 --> 26:05.108
You get her search
history restored?

26:05.109 --> 26:06.176
Working on it.

26:06.177 --> 26:07.477
Looks like she was digging

26:07.478 --> 26:09.279
Into some pretty serious
classified stuff.

26:21.192 --> 26:24.895
Hey, have you ever run across
anyone named ben mercer?

26:24.896 --> 26:26.796
Never heard of him.

26:30.301 --> 26:32.135
Uh, listen, I got to
make another call.

26:32.136 --> 26:34.204
I'll see you back
at the shop. - Yeah.

26:37.241 --> 26:39.276
Wrong guy, annie.

26:48.252 --> 26:50.487
Mm-hmm?

26:57.495 --> 26:59.462
What exactly were you searching for

26:59.463 --> 27:01.097
In the agency database?

27:01.098 --> 27:03.833
Art comps-- activity
from the auction house.

27:03.834 --> 27:05.502
I don't believe you.

27:05.503 --> 27:09.272
I don't believe a single
thing you've told me.

27:09.273 --> 27:11.808
And as far as the feds
out there are concerned,

27:11.809 --> 27:13.376
You work for the smithsonian.

27:13.377 --> 27:14.811
Do you know what that means?

27:14.812 --> 27:18.882
That means you are a citizen
ripe for prosecution.

27:18.883 --> 27:22.452
That means you are
responsible for four bodies.

27:22.453 --> 27:24.821
So unless you start opening up,

27:24.822 --> 27:27.390
Unless you start telling
me the absolute truth,

27:27.391 --> 27:30.660
I am gonna hang you
out to dry, annie.

27:30.661 --> 27:32.729
Believe me, I will.

27:34.966 --> 27:37.033
Tell me about ben mercer.

27:41.205 --> 27:42.672
This is the day she was arrested?

27:42.673 --> 27:44.074
Yeah, earlier--

27:44.075 --> 27:46.276
Before the place got
all shot to hell.

27:46.277 --> 27:48.511
Mick...

27:48.512 --> 27:50.580
That was my friend who died.

27:50.581 --> 27:52.282
Good man.

27:52.283 --> 27:55.919
- I'm sorry.
- it's my fault.

27:55.920 --> 27:58.721
I had a feeling she was trouble.

28:00.057 --> 28:01.725
Miss jacklin, she knew
something was wrong.

28:01.726 --> 28:03.927
Watch this move here...

28:03.928 --> 28:05.962
Ah. Bang.

28:07.565 --> 28:10.567
Should have pulled the trigger.

28:10.568 --> 28:12.235
How much did you not
disclose about mercer

28:12.236 --> 28:13.703
During your initial with us?

28:13.704 --> 28:15.605
Why are you so interested in ben?

28:15.606 --> 28:19.175
Because he is in this
up to his eyeballs.

28:19.176 --> 28:20.977
And is that why I was
recruited by the agency?

28:20.978 --> 28:23.480
Have you seen him?

28:23.481 --> 28:25.448
Have you seen him?

28:25.449 --> 28:28.618
Yes.

28:33.290 --> 28:37.961
Annie went to sophie,
not the other way around.

28:37.962 --> 28:40.463
Nothing in the auction house
database on who the buyer was.

28:40.464 --> 28:42.632
Jacklin must have deleted it.

28:42.633 --> 28:46.636
Nothing in annie's home either.

28:46.637 --> 28:49.038
Auggie confirmed her looking
into mercer at the agency.

28:49.039 --> 28:51.807
And she just admitted
contact with him.

28:54.845 --> 28:58.481
I still have four bodies
that I have to account for.

28:58.482 --> 29:00.049
So don't try and
pull your spook magic

29:00.050 --> 29:01.651
And disappear the
case from my docket.

29:01.652 --> 29:04.220
This is domestic
through and through.

29:04.221 --> 29:07.323
I'm not finished talking
with my client, mr. Rossabi.

29:07.324 --> 29:09.859
But I'm about to be.

29:17.835 --> 29:19.602
No more games, annie.

29:19.603 --> 29:21.404
If there's a weapons plan in play,

29:21.405 --> 29:24.407
You need to tell me
everything you know.

29:24.408 --> 29:25.975
Who's the buyer?

29:28.779 --> 29:29.979
Believe me, whatever
you think you know,

29:29.980 --> 29:32.248
I promise you,
it is not the whole truth.

29:32.249 --> 29:36.419
Ben mercer is a liar who
abandoned the agency.

29:36.420 --> 29:38.221
You need to make a
choice right now, annie,

29:38.222 --> 29:40.423
Because this is it-- right now.

29:40.424 --> 29:41.924
The name of the buyer,

29:41.925 --> 29:45.261
Or I will leave you
here to be prosecuted.

29:48.499 --> 29:51.067
I guess annie opened up.

29:51.068 --> 29:55.171
What do you think
they're gonna do to her?

29:55.172 --> 29:56.806
That's up to joan.

29:56.807 --> 29:59.542
How forgiving did she look?

29:59.543 --> 30:01.644
You could tell
as much as I could.

30:08.052 --> 30:10.053
Ben mercer was a cia operative.

30:10.054 --> 30:12.221
He turned sophie
jacklin six years ago

30:12.222 --> 30:13.356
And made her an asset.

30:13.357 --> 30:15.024
That's it?

30:15.025 --> 30:16.592
That's all you're gonna give me?

30:16.593 --> 30:17.760
I already knew that!

30:17.761 --> 30:19.395
There is no quid pro quo, annie.

30:19.396 --> 30:20.930
I don't owe you anything.

30:20.931 --> 30:23.266
- After I--
- after you what?

30:23.267 --> 30:24.834
Finally stopped lying,
breaking protocol,

30:24.835 --> 30:26.269
And did your job?

30:26.270 --> 30:29.072
You do understand that
you could be fired

30:29.073 --> 30:30.773
Or tried for treason
for what you've done.

30:30.774 --> 30:33.309
Do you understand that?

30:42.820 --> 30:44.487
He went rogue, annie.

30:44.488 --> 30:46.455
That's all that matters in the end.

30:49.493 --> 30:53.029
You never answered my question.

30:53.030 --> 30:55.331
Are you using me to get to him?

30:55.332 --> 30:57.433
Is that why you recruited me?

30:57.434 --> 30:59.602
We recruit people for
all kinds of reasons.

30:59.603 --> 31:01.370
What matters is how they
perform in their duties

31:01.371 --> 31:02.705
Once they're here.

31:02.706 --> 31:04.207
If they don't perform,
we'd let them go,

31:04.208 --> 31:05.508
No matter why they were recruited.

31:05.509 --> 31:08.010
So where do I stand?

31:08.011 --> 31:10.279
What's my status here?

31:22.760 --> 31:26.695
I thought I said to
avoid major felonies.

31:29.900 --> 31:32.602
I'm sorry, auggie.

31:32.603 --> 31:36.105
I didn't make things too
hard for you, did I?

31:40.477 --> 31:43.746
My problem is I like you,

31:43.747 --> 31:46.149
So I'm always gonna
try and cover for you,

31:46.150 --> 31:47.950
Which I now see is going to lead me

31:47.951 --> 31:49.385
Straight to potential treason.

31:49.386 --> 31:51.354
If they would just be
straight with me about ben,

31:51.355 --> 31:53.389
I could settle it in my own head.

31:53.390 --> 31:55.424
What do you know about-
- I can't, annie.

31:55.425 --> 31:57.960
Even if I did know
something, I can't.

31:59.630 --> 32:02.131
So...

32:02.132 --> 32:04.867
How bad was the fallout, anyway?

32:06.904 --> 32:10.973
I have to report
to fbi agent rossabi.

32:10.974 --> 32:14.110
It's part of my release and
something about good will,

32:14.111 --> 32:15.945
To help him with the
bramble's shooter.

32:15.946 --> 32:18.047
You know what that is, right?

32:19.449 --> 32:21.551
A huge break.

32:21.552 --> 32:24.921
Don't kid yourself.

32:24.922 --> 32:26.622
Joan must like you.

32:26.623 --> 32:28.858
Ha! Right.

32:28.859 --> 32:32.361
I can't stop thinking about sophie.

32:35.132 --> 32:38.334
I feel like it's my fault.
Hey, don't do that, annie.

32:38.335 --> 32:39.936
You can't shoulder that.

32:39.937 --> 32:42.338
Russ hilburn killed her.

32:44.341 --> 32:46.775
Just tell me it gets easier.

32:50.581 --> 32:52.548
When it does...

32:52.549 --> 32:56.986
That's when you have to start
worrying about yourself.

33:17.074 --> 33:18.741
Where do you keep your gun

33:18.742 --> 33:20.509
When you're being a museum curator?

33:20.510 --> 33:22.879
I don't carry a gun.
And I'm not a curator.

33:22.880 --> 33:24.680
I'm in acquisitions.

33:24.681 --> 33:26.082
Is that a spook cover deal,

33:26.083 --> 33:28.084
Or are you actually
qualified for that?

33:28.085 --> 33:29.685
Oh, I'm fully qualified.

33:29.686 --> 33:32.054
Want to quiz me?

33:32.055 --> 33:34.957
You don't really have a
badge to flash, do you?

33:34.958 --> 33:37.994
I have a library card.
It's like a badge.

33:37.995 --> 33:39.929
It's badge-like.

33:41.899 --> 33:45.501
Agent rossabi, fbi.
You got a crime scene here?

33:53.143 --> 33:54.843
Wow.

33:56.813 --> 33:58.848
Not bad for a bunch of art majors.

33:58.849 --> 34:02.284
You guys tore it up.

34:05.856 --> 34:09.592
This is where the
director went down.

34:09.592 --> 34:12.962
For all intents and purposes,
agent rossabi,

34:12.963 --> 34:14.496
She was in my custody.

34:14.498 --> 34:16.364
Ah, it was the first time you
lost someone on your watch.

34:16.366 --> 34:19.101
Can't let it take you down...

34:19.101 --> 34:22.170
Whether you're a cop
or an art dealer.

34:24.507 --> 34:26.074
A colleague of mine
said that earlier.

34:26.076 --> 34:27.909
It feels like something
that people say

34:27.911 --> 34:29.312
To avoid the ugly feelings.

34:29.313 --> 34:30.646
You got to own the ugly feelings.

34:30.647 --> 34:31.981
That's our responsibility.

34:31.982 --> 34:33.849
You just don't get
lost in the guilt.

34:33.850 --> 34:36.652
Can't afford it in
our line of work.

34:37.888 --> 34:39.621
Oh!

34:39.623 --> 34:41.257
Oh, wow.

34:42.826 --> 34:45.328
That's 20 years'
worth of my salary.

34:45.329 --> 34:46.728
About-- it's about 20.

34:46.730 --> 34:49.831
Well, the bad guys
left it teetering.

34:49.833 --> 34:52.234
It was clearly teetering.
The cole painting's down here.

34:52.235 --> 34:54.737
Great.

35:06.383 --> 35:08.184
Standard issue switchblade?

35:08.185 --> 35:10.452
See, I bet the smithsonian
doesn't let you have these.

35:19.696 --> 35:23.232
Important enough to come back for.

35:34.077 --> 35:35.744
What the hell?

35:39.883 --> 35:42.351
He had to come and get
it after your shootout,

35:42.352 --> 35:44.219
In the last 24 hours.

35:49.593 --> 35:52.394
Or the last five minutes.

35:58.247 --> 36:00.348
You can't possibly
view this as my fault.

36:00.349 --> 36:01.716
I did exactly what you said--

36:01.717 --> 36:04.618
Interdepartmental... Whatever.

36:04.619 --> 36:05.953
Can I help it if it took us

36:05.954 --> 36:07.888
To what you guys are
supposed to be finding?

36:07.889 --> 36:09.256
- No.
- Do we have any other leads

36:09.257 --> 36:10.491
On where hilburn might be headed,

36:10.492 --> 36:11.859
Any other intel?

36:11.860 --> 36:14.495
Nothing actionable yet.

36:14.496 --> 36:16.197
What do you want me to do?

36:16.198 --> 36:18.199
Just...

36:18.200 --> 36:19.600
Go home.

36:19.601 --> 36:22.937
Go home and stay home for
the rest of the night.

36:22.938 --> 36:25.239
Please.

37:37.846 --> 37:40.347
Hello, smithsonian.

37:40.348 --> 37:44.452
It's you... The guy
from the auction.

37:44.453 --> 37:46.720
You're russ hilburn.

37:46.721 --> 37:49.723
The other guy-- - oh,
he's also on the payroll.

37:49.724 --> 37:55.629
Like to keep them guessing,
just in case, well...

37:55.630 --> 37:58.065
And you don't work
for the smithsonian.

37:58.066 --> 37:59.467
Actually, I do.

37:59.468 --> 38:02.836
But you file more
than one tax return.

38:06.775 --> 38:09.944
Is that how you treat
iconic american art?

38:09.945 --> 38:11.712
It wasn't really about the piece

38:11.713 --> 38:14.248
So much as the packaging.

38:14.249 --> 38:16.350
Take her inland.

38:16.351 --> 38:18.485
Dumping's not allowed
in the harbor.

38:34.102 --> 38:36.537
He said don't kill
me in the harbor!

38:36.538 --> 38:38.272
No. He said don't dump you here.

38:38.273 --> 38:40.674
I can kill you wherever.

39:57.752 --> 39:59.820
Hey!

39:59.821 --> 40:03.023
That's not really a fair fight.

40:06.094 --> 40:07.761
Have harbor patrol pick up hilburn.

40:07.762 --> 40:09.930
He can't be more than a mile out.

40:14.135 --> 40:15.436
Joan had you tail me?

40:15.437 --> 40:17.338
I think it worked out.

40:17.339 --> 40:19.139
* I'm so tired *

40:26.615 --> 40:28.983
* being worried *

40:28.984 --> 40:33.420
* ill and unkind *

40:36.324 --> 40:38.792
* if I could stop my panic *

40:38.793 --> 40:41.795
* abandon my troubles *

40:41.796 --> 40:45.833
* let go of my doubts *

40:45.834 --> 40:48.869
* maybe then *

40:48.870 --> 40:51.405
* I'd be just fine *

40:51.406 --> 40:52.973
She told me mercer
left her a matchbook

40:52.974 --> 40:55.309
With hilburn's slip number
written on the inside cover.

40:55.310 --> 40:57.711
She went after hilburn herself--
no backup.

40:57.712 --> 40:59.280
Well, I think she thought
mercer would be there,

40:59.281 --> 41:00.948
Not hilburn.

41:00.949 --> 41:03.117
And you accuse me of
putting her in harm's way.

41:03.118 --> 41:05.953
My guess is mercer thought
annie would report it,

41:05.954 --> 41:08.355
Just like she did with the auction.

41:08.356 --> 41:10.858
Why write it on a matchbook?

41:10.859 --> 41:13.160
He was probably trying to
order the way things went down,

41:13.161 --> 41:14.762
To make sure annie
brought sophie here first

41:14.763 --> 41:16.797
To protect her.

41:16.798 --> 41:18.832
Can't say he
accomplished that, did he?

41:18.833 --> 41:20.467
Sometimes men can be misguided

41:20.468 --> 41:23.604
When they think
they're helping women.

41:23.605 --> 41:25.806
We're not using annie
as bait anymore.

41:25.807 --> 41:28.442
It's not your call.

41:30.578 --> 41:32.179
As long as annie works for us,

41:32.180 --> 41:34.848
Mercer's gonna be
keeping tabs on her.

41:34.849 --> 41:36.317
Annie is in this,

41:36.318 --> 41:40.120
Whether she wants to be or not.

41:40.121 --> 41:42.856
See ya at home?

42:02.380 --> 42:06.975
