WEBVTT

00:10.385 --> 00:12.387
Honestly, I don't know what's weirder.

00:12.471 --> 00:15.140
A whole flock of dead birds,
or the fact it wasn't on the news.

00:15.224 --> 00:17.893
Yeah, or the fact
that Jessica's actually being nice to me.

00:17.976 --> 00:21.313
Did they just get sick at the same time
and just fall out of the sky?

00:21.396 --> 00:24.149
And what about that creepy basement.
Are they related?

00:24.858 --> 00:26.276
That feels weird.

00:26.360 --> 00:29.821
God, I mean, she's a junior.
She'd be hanging out with seniors by now.

00:29.905 --> 00:32.281
And she, like, drives her own car.

00:32.366 --> 00:33.951
There was lightning at the time.

00:34.368 --> 00:36.912
And there's been some weird weather
in Erie Harbor,

00:36.995 --> 00:39.122
and Donny's hurricane in Ireland.

00:39.623 --> 00:42.459
I mean, who actually gets a car
for their sweet 16?

00:42.543 --> 00:44.461
I thought that was, like, a movie thing.

00:44.545 --> 00:47.005
Can't believe I actually had fun
in Erie Harbor.

00:47.089 --> 00:50.717
"How many birds can get hit
by a single bolt of lightning?"

00:57.432 --> 00:58.517
Oh, no.

00:58.600 --> 00:59.601
Geez...

01:02.980 --> 01:06.525
Well, at least we can use your laptop
as a light.

01:07.109 --> 01:08.944
No, I'm using it for research.

01:11.780 --> 01:13.490
And the Wi-Fi is down.

01:16.118 --> 01:18.120
Hey, hey, hey. No. It's okay, Ginny.

01:18.203 --> 01:19.663
I'm scared.

01:19.746 --> 01:21.957
I know, honey. It's okay. You're good.

01:25.711 --> 01:27.296
Mom! Dad!

01:28.422 --> 01:29.840
-Oh, my God.
-Dad!

01:29.923 --> 01:32.426
-Straight through the window.
-Get some buckets or something.

01:33.051 --> 01:34.761
-Dad?
-Mom, what's happening?

01:34.845 --> 01:37.139
Everything's fine, guys, all right?
Don't freak out.

01:37.222 --> 01:39.141
Dad, we have a whole tree
in our living room. What are you--

01:39.224 --> 01:41.393
Okay, you know what, girls,
you should probably go back upstairs

01:41.476 --> 01:43.437
because there's broken glass
all over the place.

01:43.520 --> 01:47.065
Pop-Pop, it's fine, it's okay.
Don't worry. Everything's okay.

01:47.149 --> 01:49.359
-Look, I'm gonna clean all this up.
-Okay.

01:51.737 --> 01:52.863
Yeah, Hilde...

01:52.946 --> 01:54.031
Do you hear that?

01:54.907 --> 01:56.241
Wait.

01:59.077 --> 02:00.078
What is it?

02:01.205 --> 02:03.540
Hilde, Hilde, don't, don't, don't, don't.

02:03.624 --> 02:04.708
Just be careful,

02:04.791 --> 02:06.835
-there's glass down there. Careful.
-Daddy, I will.

02:09.378 --> 02:11.548
Hey, little one. I got you, I got you.

02:12.132 --> 02:15.135
It's okay. I got you. It's okay.

02:15.219 --> 02:18.555
You're safe with me, buddy.
I'm not gonna hurt you.

02:20.224 --> 02:22.142
Sorry about your tree.

02:22.851 --> 02:25.687
Don't worry.
Nothing bad is gonna happen to you.

02:25.771 --> 02:27.105
I promise.

02:54.508 --> 02:57.135
-Do we have to go to school today?
-Yes, you do.

02:57.219 --> 02:59.471
-The baby bird kept me up all night.
-Well, yeah.

02:59.555 --> 03:01.974
Now you know what it was like
for me when I had you three as babies.

03:02.057 --> 03:03.851
Do you think I could give him some milk?

03:03.934 --> 03:06.687
Well, mama birds don't feed milk
to their young.

03:06.770 --> 03:08.689
Yeah, they puke into their mouths.

03:10.023 --> 03:13.402
I definitely need to talk to Birdman about
what could've killed all those birds.

03:13.485 --> 03:15.070
And maybe he could help me with Walter.

03:15.153 --> 03:16.738
-Walter?
-Cronkite.

03:17.948 --> 03:19.950
He was a journalist on TV.

03:20.033 --> 03:22.911
Everyone called him
the most trusted man in America.

03:25.205 --> 03:28.542
Hey, Mom, do you think maybe we should,
like, see if Dad needs any help?

03:28.625 --> 03:31.545
-Your daddy thinks he's handy.
-But he's not.

03:31.628 --> 03:33.755
He ripped a hole in the attic
and never fixed it.

03:33.839 --> 03:37.426
Okay, look, honey,
I know how you feel about the truth,

03:37.509 --> 03:40.012
but it isn't always the best thing.

03:40.095 --> 03:42.472
Okay, sometimes with men, you have to...

03:45.767 --> 03:48.270
You know what,
this feels like a whole can of worms.

03:48.353 --> 03:49.646
Can we just...

03:50.772 --> 03:52.816
-Good job, honey.
-You're so great, Dad.

03:52.900 --> 03:54.818
-Dad!
-You're doing it!

03:56.445 --> 03:59.281
So, Mom, what's the latest
with Wott Management?

03:59.364 --> 04:01.408
God, just write an article
about the dumb tree

04:01.491 --> 04:04.077
that crashed into our dumb house
with a dumb bird in it.

04:04.161 --> 04:05.495
Mom, did you know

04:05.579 --> 04:08.749
Wott Management was named
after a guy who was born in the 1800s?

04:08.832 --> 04:10.792
-No.
-He basically founded Erie Harbor

04:10.876 --> 04:12.294
and bought up all the forests here.

04:13.253 --> 04:14.379
To chop them down.

04:15.464 --> 04:18.466
Wait, so they just like randomly chose
his name for their company?

04:18.550 --> 04:19.551
I doubt it was random.

04:19.635 --> 04:22.638
Whoever owns the place
must've used that name for a reason.

04:22.721 --> 04:25.557
Yeah, well, it might give them
an air of legitimacy.

04:25.641 --> 04:28.393
I can't get this baby bird
to eat anything.

04:28.810 --> 04:31.063
Dad, I'm gonna have
to take him to Birdman.

04:31.146 --> 04:34.691
Yeah, well, you can,
but his name is not Birdman, remember?

04:34.775 --> 04:36.443
His name is Mr. Wergeles.

04:36.527 --> 04:39.863
Okay, party people,
let's get dressed for it, right?

04:39.947 --> 04:42.491
Yeah, grab your jacket, grab your shoes.

04:42.574 --> 04:45.202
-Hilde, where are you going?
-Riding my bike.

04:51.166 --> 04:52.376
Hey, can I use your charger?

04:52.459 --> 04:54.169
-No, no, no. I need it.
-Mom.

04:54.253 --> 04:56.338
What? I have no idea how long
the power will be out,

04:56.421 --> 04:57.965
or if I'll have functioning phones
at work,

04:58.048 --> 05:00.259
where I make money so you can eat.

05:00.968 --> 05:03.053
God, it'll take, like, a minute, okay?

05:03.136 --> 05:05.055
I just need enough time to call Ethan.

05:05.138 --> 05:07.099
Okay, cool,
so that's why you're yelling at me.

05:07.182 --> 05:09.184
Mom, I'm not yelling at you.

05:09.935 --> 05:12.437
I'm just frustrated
because this stupid power's out.

05:12.521 --> 05:14.815
You can't go one day
without talking to him?

05:14.898 --> 05:16.817
Hello, I already have.

05:16.900 --> 05:18.193
Iz.

05:18.277 --> 05:21.029
We're just supposed to do this thing
before school,

05:21.113 --> 05:23.115
where we tell each other
to have a good day.

05:23.198 --> 05:25.075
Okay? It's just a thing.

05:25.659 --> 05:26.952
It's our thing.

05:27.703 --> 05:28.704
It's dumb, whatever.

05:28.787 --> 05:33.208
Look, just do me a favor and try and enjoy
what it feels like to be disconnected

05:33.292 --> 05:37.045
for a day or at least a couple of minutes.

05:40.215 --> 05:41.425
What is going on?

05:45.095 --> 05:47.264
There's no controlling this.

05:47.347 --> 05:48.765
It's a natural disaster.

05:48.849 --> 05:50.350
School is canceled

05:50.434 --> 05:53.770
until the tree can be removed
and power restored.

05:56.773 --> 05:59.610
Let's try and pretend
that we're sad we're missing school.

05:59.693 --> 06:01.486
-You are so not organized.
-Excuse me,

06:01.570 --> 06:03.155
how did you not know about this
an hour ago?

06:03.238 --> 06:04.907
-We didn't get any e-mails or anything.
-Sorry.

06:04.990 --> 06:06.950
How are you gonna take control over this?

06:07.034 --> 06:10.621
Ladies, I'm sorry, it's not safe for you
to come past the barrier.

06:11.663 --> 06:12.831
Hey.

06:13.707 --> 06:16.335
-Did you hear they canceled school?
-Oh, cool.

06:17.085 --> 06:18.712
Yeah, so what are you gonna do?

06:20.756 --> 06:23.342
I'll probably just head down
to the pier, walk around, or whatever.

06:23.842 --> 06:24.843
Cool.

06:26.094 --> 06:27.179
Do you wanna come?

06:28.388 --> 06:30.140
-Yeah.
-Hey, Jessica.

06:30.224 --> 06:32.518
Hey. Do you wanna go to the pier?

06:32.601 --> 06:34.436
-Totally.
-Cool. Great.

06:35.229 --> 06:37.356
This is my friend Emma.
She just moved here.

06:37.439 --> 06:39.358
-Hi.
-Hey. Izzy.

06:39.441 --> 06:41.902
My family just moved here
about a year ago from Brooklyn.

06:41.985 --> 06:45.322
Nice. We used to live in Virginia,
but my mom got transferred for work.

06:46.448 --> 06:49.493
I mean you already have so many
friends that's, like, great.

06:49.576 --> 06:51.078
I'll see you guys at the pier.

06:51.578 --> 06:53.997
-Same. Later, Izzy.
-Bye.

06:57.376 --> 06:59.670
-Do you need a ride?
-Yeah.

07:00.462 --> 07:02.464
Let me just tell my mom
where I'm going first, though.

07:02.548 --> 07:05.133
Right, I forget you're like 14 sometimes.

07:05.217 --> 07:07.219
Probably 'cause you take
so many upper-level classes.

07:08.262 --> 07:10.305
No, no, no, I meant that as a compliment.

07:10.389 --> 07:13.684
Well, yeah, you know what,
I'll just text her.

07:13.767 --> 07:15.185
-Okay.
-It's fine, yeah.

07:16.979 --> 07:19.189
-That's good.
-Cool. This way.

07:21.024 --> 07:24.403
We need to do some research
on how to take care of this bird. Here.

07:24.486 --> 07:25.779
Got it.

07:29.491 --> 07:31.994
I still don't understand
why you'd wanna use the smallest person

07:32.077 --> 07:34.288
as the step stool, but okay.

07:37.249 --> 07:38.458
Oh, that's smart.

07:44.673 --> 07:45.966
When is school gonna get back in?

07:46.049 --> 07:47.467
She's as bad as her ex-con mother!

07:47.551 --> 07:48.552
So unorganized!

07:48.635 --> 07:50.095
My tax dollars are paying your salary.

07:50.179 --> 07:51.346
I understand this is inconvenient,

07:51.430 --> 07:53.265
-but it's out of my control.
-Hey, hold this for me. Okay?

07:53.348 --> 07:55.017
I need to take my kids somewhere.
Where am I supposed to go?

07:55.100 --> 07:57.519
-She's totally incompetent.
-Excuse me, can I?

07:58.395 --> 08:03.984
If anyone has any questions or grievances,
like you ladies with your petition,

08:04.067 --> 08:05.777
you could take it up with her lawyer.

08:05.861 --> 08:10.115
And who's that? That's me.
And right now my client has no comment.

08:11.200 --> 08:13.785
Thank you. Have a nice day.

08:16.705 --> 08:19.583
Look, you don't have to hire me
as your lawyer, obviously.

08:19.666 --> 08:22.044
It's just, this town.

08:22.836 --> 08:26.006
No, I think I'm getting used to the abuse.

08:26.840 --> 08:28.717
But I appreciate your support.

08:29.259 --> 08:32.638
I know how much it sucks to be
on that end of the pitchfork.

08:33.304 --> 08:37.851
So I'd like to try and help you
put an end to this,

08:37.934 --> 08:39.977
-if you'll let me?
-Mommy.

08:40.895 --> 08:42.022
Oh, geez, I--

08:43.023 --> 08:44.316
You know, I'm sorry.

08:45.400 --> 08:48.820
After the third child they just, you know,
they sort of start raising themselves.

08:48.904 --> 08:51.698
Well, I'll remind you
when she starts to apply for college.

08:51.782 --> 08:53.200
Thank you. Let's go.

08:53.742 --> 08:55.369
I'll be in touch. Okay?

08:56.912 --> 08:57.955
Thank you.

09:15.264 --> 09:18.767
Guys, school is closed.
How did you... get in here?

09:18.851 --> 09:21.687
Principal Collins told me to catch up
on my schoolwork.

09:21.770 --> 09:25.440
Just because school's canceled doesn't
mean that learning takes the day off.

09:25.941 --> 09:28.235
So, you spoke to Principal Collins?

09:28.318 --> 09:33.240
Yeah, she loves what you've done in here.
I mean, like, the stacks are super neat.

09:33.323 --> 09:36.118
Like the way the aisles look
in the expensive grocery stores.

09:38.662 --> 09:41.623
I mean,
I just lined the bindings up and...

09:42.207 --> 09:45.460
My dad does that.
I think he has undiagnosed anxiety.

09:45.544 --> 09:48.088
And I'm starting to worry
that maybe it's genetic.

09:48.172 --> 09:49.798
You should get that checked out.

09:51.925 --> 09:54.845
Do you have any books on feeding
or nurturing baby birds?

09:54.928 --> 09:56.305
Or figuring out why they're sick?

09:56.388 --> 09:59.433
Or why they might fall out of the sky
and die for no reason?

10:00.726 --> 10:03.061
Maybe,
but this is a public-school library.

10:03.145 --> 10:05.772
There's only a limited number
of books that we can have--

10:05.856 --> 10:07.441
No problem, we'll just use the computer.

10:07.858 --> 10:10.319
Yes problem, because there's no power,

10:10.402 --> 10:13.864
which is why no students
are supposed to be here.

10:13.947 --> 10:16.158
Yeah, you know what,
that makes sense. Yeah.

10:16.241 --> 10:17.910
Unless you know something I don't.

10:17.993 --> 10:20.621
If Principal Collins said
that you can be here, then...

10:21.371 --> 10:23.790
It's okay. We have to go anyways.

10:26.126 --> 10:27.336
Thanks, Tony.

10:27.419 --> 10:29.505
Please don't call me that. Yeah. But...

10:31.632 --> 10:33.091
-Bye.
-Bye.

10:33.884 --> 10:36.637
-And don't run in the halls.
-Thanks, Tony.

10:37.554 --> 10:41.266
It's Mr. O'Hara.

10:55.280 --> 10:58.283
I've been looking for a spot
ever since the cabin flooded.

11:07.376 --> 11:09.086
My grandpa showed me this place.

11:09.711 --> 11:11.797
He used to store his fishing gear here.

11:12.297 --> 11:15.551
Rustic chic. I can work with this.

11:15.634 --> 11:17.427
Told you I'd get a good cabin.

11:18.387 --> 11:22.224
So, I haven't been able to get in touch
with anyone from Wott Management.

11:22.891 --> 11:26.895
Do you know if your dad ever
dealt with anyone in person?

11:26.979 --> 11:30.774
Or had any correspondence with them
under a different name?

11:30.858 --> 11:32.943
Not that I know of, but I'll ask him.

11:39.074 --> 11:40.158
Hello?

11:42.119 --> 11:43.954
Just-- Hey.

11:45.163 --> 11:46.790
Hello? Are you still there?

11:47.332 --> 11:50.669
Yeah, it's just the door
to my office was open,

11:50.752 --> 11:52.004
but I know I locked it.

11:52.087 --> 11:53.547
-You all right?
-Yeah.

11:53.630 --> 11:55.340
Just hang out right there, okay?

11:56.133 --> 11:57.885
In your experience,

11:57.968 --> 12:04.266
does anyone ever break into a place
and not steal anything?

12:04.349 --> 12:06.351
Oh, no.
See, I don't like the sound of that.

12:06.435 --> 12:08.645
Why don't you turn around
and get out of there?

12:08.729 --> 12:09.897
Can you come here?

12:09.980 --> 12:11.565
Yep, be right there. Come on, let's go.

12:15.402 --> 12:17.404
It's not stealing
if you plan to return it.

12:17.487 --> 12:19.990
It's borrowing,
which is what the library is for.

12:20.073 --> 12:22.075
Plus, I left my card as collateral.

12:22.784 --> 12:24.203
We have library cards?

12:24.912 --> 12:26.496
Well, not technically.

12:28.665 --> 12:30.167
Okay, no, not at all.

12:30.250 --> 12:32.753
I made it when I used to play library
with Izzy.

12:32.836 --> 12:34.296
You played library?

12:34.379 --> 12:36.715
-Didn't everyone?
-No.

12:36.798 --> 12:40.093
You know, checking the books in and out,
filling out the forms?

12:40.928 --> 12:43.222
-No?
-No.

12:44.473 --> 12:46.975
Come on, Walter, you gotta eat, buddy.

12:47.059 --> 12:48.477
You named the bird Walter?

12:48.560 --> 12:50.562
-After Cronkite.
-Walter Cronkite.

12:51.188 --> 12:52.189
I don't know.

12:52.272 --> 12:56.193
He's still not eating,
you decorated his box and you named him.

12:56.276 --> 12:58.362
That bird is definitely gonna die.

12:59.530 --> 13:00.572
Oh, man.

13:01.615 --> 13:04.451
I do not know if I'm ready
for this emotional journey.

13:05.285 --> 13:07.412
It looks like we've been feeding him
the wrong food.

13:07.496 --> 13:09.414
We need to make him a bird smoothie.

13:10.123 --> 13:11.750
I love a smoothie.

13:11.834 --> 13:13.126
Actually, it's...

13:14.127 --> 13:16.672
worms, bird poop and water.

13:18.799 --> 13:21.885
Are you sure you locked up last night
and set the alarm?

13:21.969 --> 13:24.429
-Yeah. I always do.
-All right, come on.

13:25.180 --> 13:26.390
It's good that you came in.

13:26.473 --> 13:30.602
Yeah, it was just really creepy, you know?
I just--

13:33.814 --> 13:36.733
Look, maybe it was the power outage
that knocked out the alarm,

13:36.817 --> 13:39.570
-or the storm blew the door open...
-Yeah.

13:39.653 --> 13:41.947
-...but it's a lot of ifs.
-Yeah.

13:42.030 --> 13:44.408
Can you think of anyone
with a grudge against you?

13:44.491 --> 13:46.577
Take your pick. You know, it could be...

13:47.578 --> 13:49.913
someone pissed off at me
for representing Sam.

13:49.997 --> 13:52.875
I've taken on a new case.
Maybe it has something to do with that.

13:52.958 --> 13:54.376
Oh, great.

13:55.794 --> 13:57.671
Lieutenant Briggs.

13:57.754 --> 14:00.132
-Fill out that assessment yet?
-I have not yet, sir.

14:00.215 --> 14:04.428
I am working on a potential
break-in at First and Main.

14:04.511 --> 14:07.514
Mrs. Lisko, this is Paul Rutherford.

14:07.598 --> 14:10.100
It's Jensen. I kept my last name.

14:10.184 --> 14:12.936
Right. I knew that. Sorry about that.

14:13.020 --> 14:14.813
It's okay. It's nice to meet you.

14:14.897 --> 14:16.315
Yeah, I'm an investigator.

14:16.398 --> 14:18.775
The Attorney General hired me
to audit the department.

14:18.859 --> 14:20.652
After what happened with...

14:22.196 --> 14:23.405
My dad?

14:24.114 --> 14:26.408
Yeah. So, that's cool.

14:26.867 --> 14:31.288
Attorney General?
The state must be taking this seriously.

14:31.371 --> 14:34.124
Washington state does not take kindly

14:34.208 --> 14:37.628
to the depletion
of the wrongful conviction fund, so...

14:37.711 --> 14:39.880
-yes, we are.
-Mr. Rutherford here

14:39.963 --> 14:42.841
is in charge of letting the AG know
whether we're all fired.

14:43.675 --> 14:47.179
Yeah, something like that.
Do you mind if I sit in?

14:48.680 --> 14:50.474
I guess not.

14:51.099 --> 14:52.476
Of course, sir.

14:53.936 --> 14:57.439
Miss Jensen, can you describe
the scene when you entered?

14:57.523 --> 14:58.524
Yeah.

15:06.490 --> 15:09.910
-We're worried about him.
-It's a good thing you brought him here.

15:09.993 --> 15:11.578
Do you think he's gonna be okay?

15:12.371 --> 15:14.748
Well, this will definitely help.

15:15.415 --> 15:19.044
Because a bunch of birds just died.
Like, a whole flock of them.

15:19.127 --> 15:20.754
It was awful.

15:20.838 --> 15:23.882
And we're worried that this little guy
might have the same thing.

15:23.966 --> 15:25.592
A lot? Well, how many?

15:25.676 --> 15:28.011
I don't know, hundreds.

15:28.095 --> 15:29.263
What?

15:29.346 --> 15:31.807
That doesn't make any sense.
I would've heard about it.

15:31.890 --> 15:34.434
I know.
It's weird that no one's talking about it.

15:34.518 --> 15:36.645
It happened
at the Woodruff Mansion last night.

15:36.728 --> 15:40.524
-The dead birds were all over the lawn.
-It was terrifying.

15:40.607 --> 15:42.693
They just fell out of the sky.

15:43.360 --> 15:45.404
We lost a lot of good birds that day.

15:45.487 --> 15:49.449
They made people go out the back way
so nobody from the party posted pictures.

15:49.533 --> 15:52.077
I was gonna publish
but then the power went out.

15:52.160 --> 15:54.204
Well, is that where you found this one?

15:54.288 --> 15:56.081
A tree fell in our yard during the storm.

15:56.164 --> 15:59.835
And when it crashed through our window,
this little guy came with it.

15:59.918 --> 16:02.629
That's why we brought him to you.
You're the expert.

16:03.881 --> 16:04.965
Mr. Wergeles?

16:05.716 --> 16:07.217
Do you think it could be possible

16:07.301 --> 16:10.929
that he's sick with the same thing
that could've killed all those birds?

16:11.930 --> 16:16.393
I'd have to see the dead flock.
Do you think you could take me to them?

16:20.147 --> 16:21.982
There we go. Got him?

16:22.983 --> 16:24.109
Okay.

16:25.903 --> 16:28.030
Are you sure that this is it?

16:29.948 --> 16:32.492
Maybe they hired someone to clean it up.

16:32.576 --> 16:35.621
Well, if there were that many dead birds,

16:35.704 --> 16:38.999
I mean, there would need
to be a wider investigation.

16:39.416 --> 16:42.920
You know, I can call animal control,
and I can find out what caused it.

16:43.504 --> 16:44.505
Wait, hang on.

16:45.130 --> 16:46.131
Yeah.

16:47.257 --> 16:48.258
Here.

16:49.051 --> 16:52.137
Now you see, if I had the entire bird,

16:52.221 --> 16:54.890
it would be easier to figure out
what caused it.

16:54.973 --> 16:57.684
But a feather is better than nothing.

17:00.687 --> 17:02.105
I see one over there.

17:02.606 --> 17:04.233
Wait. Here, here, here.

17:05.275 --> 17:07.611
A couple for you. There you go.

17:07.694 --> 17:09.195
And two for you.

17:09.695 --> 17:11.031
-There you go.
-Thank you.

17:11.114 --> 17:14.284
You're welcome.
And the more we find, the better.

17:15.702 --> 17:19.790
In the meantime,
you keep Walter in a warm environment.

17:19.873 --> 17:25.462
And keep trying to get him to eat, okay?
'Cause if he doesn't eat, well,

17:25.546 --> 17:28.464
nothing that we find
out here will help him.

17:29.424 --> 17:30.843
-Okay?
-Okay.

17:30.926 --> 17:33.262
All right. Get a baggy.

17:34.847 --> 17:36.473
How you guys doing? You find some more?

17:36.557 --> 17:38.684
-Yeah, we got two.
-Oh, great. Here.

17:39.309 --> 17:40.602
Yeah.

17:41.186 --> 17:42.729
That guy's a little intense.

17:42.813 --> 17:46.608
Just wait till he finds out I'm the one
driving Sam's wrongful convictions suit.

17:48.944 --> 17:50.404
Hey, can I ask you favor?

17:50.988 --> 17:53.323
Yeah, I'll stop by the office tonight.
I'll check on things.

17:53.407 --> 17:56.159
No. I mean, yes. Thank you, yes.

17:56.243 --> 17:59.371
But it's another thing. It's about Matt.

17:59.454 --> 18:00.539
Is everything okay?

18:00.622 --> 18:03.375
Any chance you could come by the house
and fix some things?

18:04.543 --> 18:09.047
It's just, a window got broken and Matt,
he's so bad at fixing things

18:09.131 --> 18:11.758
and I just--
I don't wanna hurt his feelings.

18:11.842 --> 18:15.345
-But I also don't wanna not have a window.
-Oh, God! He's the worst at that stuff.

18:15.429 --> 18:17.181
-Right?
-I'll come by after work

18:17.264 --> 18:20.434
-and make up an excuse to do it for him.
-Thank you.

18:20.517 --> 18:21.810
You're doing the right thing.

18:21.894 --> 18:24.062
Yeah, Ginny and I,
we just drained the battery on the drill

18:24.146 --> 18:25.480
so he wouldn't hurt himself.

18:26.356 --> 18:28.317
That's smart. That's just plain smart.

18:28.400 --> 18:30.110
It was her idea, so...

18:30.652 --> 18:32.905
-Okay, let's go, right? You cold?
-Hey.

18:32.988 --> 18:36.200
-I will be there at 8:00.
-Okay. I'll see you later.

18:36.283 --> 18:37.409
Come on, let's go.

18:37.910 --> 18:40.287
The district would be happy
to provide support.

18:40.370 --> 18:41.747
You just tell us what you need.

18:41.830 --> 18:45.501
Well, if I thought a few generators would
make a difference, I would let you know,

18:45.584 --> 18:47.753
but I think we're just gonna have to wait.

18:47.836 --> 18:49.004
Right, right.

18:49.505 --> 18:51.340
You know, Kim, as you know,

18:51.423 --> 18:55.135
the school board has been fielding a lot
of calls from concerned parents lately.

18:55.219 --> 18:57.971
They've been, shall we say, very vocal.

18:58.055 --> 18:59.056
Yes, I know.

18:59.932 --> 19:02.142
People get stressed out
in emergency situations.

19:02.226 --> 19:05.062
It's not about the blackout though.
Kim, you should be prepared.

19:05.145 --> 19:06.480
These parents are out for blood.

19:06.563 --> 19:09.608
Well, I think I ran into
a few of them this morning.

19:10.442 --> 19:12.778
Pretty sure they were trying
to blame me personally

19:12.861 --> 19:14.988
for the power going out across town.

19:15.072 --> 19:17.407
Yeah, they're not
the most reasonable people in the world,

19:17.491 --> 19:19.243
but they are taxpayers and voters.

19:19.326 --> 19:22.955
They are petitioning the district
to place your employment under review.

19:23.789 --> 19:24.790
Fire?

19:25.499 --> 19:27.793
Well, you can say "fire."

19:27.876 --> 19:30.128
Yeah, that's what it would mean.

19:30.212 --> 19:33.924
And if enough parents sign on,
we'll have to honor their request.

19:35.676 --> 19:37.636
Thank you for telling me in person.

19:37.719 --> 19:40.055
Yeah, we all know
that your mother's actions were her own,

19:40.138 --> 19:42.182
but you can see the issue.

19:43.475 --> 19:45.727
I gotta run. We'll talk soon though.

20:02.536 --> 20:03.829
-Hey.
-Hey.

20:04.329 --> 20:05.455
Where were you?

20:05.539 --> 20:07.833
I was just dropping my dad off
at Frank's place.

20:09.126 --> 20:11.670
You know, he's got his own generator
up and running.

20:12.588 --> 20:15.257
-Lucky Frank.
-I know, right?

20:19.136 --> 20:21.847
Hey, you know when power outages
used to be fun?

20:21.930 --> 20:25.267
Remember that?
Yeah, it used to be, like, sexy and...

20:25.851 --> 20:28.061
-Remember that? Yeah.
-Oh, yeah, I remember that.

20:28.145 --> 20:30.606
And now it's just rotting food.

20:31.773 --> 20:34.735
And watching Ginny
plug in electrical devices

20:34.818 --> 20:37.696
that are clearly not gonna turn on.

20:37.779 --> 20:40.032
-Oh, yeah.
-Hey, can I sleep at Jessica's?

20:40.115 --> 20:42.951
-No, no. You cannot, no.
-Why not?

20:43.035 --> 20:45.370
Well, because it's a school night,
that's why not.

20:45.454 --> 20:49.208
Yeah, didn't Jessica torture you,
like, all of last year?

20:50.334 --> 20:53.754
Well, yeah, but she's being nice now
because people change.

20:53.837 --> 20:56.298
Okay, and you always said
forgiveness was a virtue, so...

20:56.381 --> 20:58.342
Yeah,
when your little sister was punching you,

20:58.425 --> 21:02.679
not when your mortal enemy is trying
to win you over for some strange reason.

21:02.763 --> 21:05.557
God. You are just as bad as Hilde.
Okay, Jessica just wants to be friends.

21:05.641 --> 21:10.354
And since I don't have any,
I would like to go to her house. Please?

21:11.522 --> 21:12.856
No. No.

21:12.940 --> 21:15.776
Come on, I'm almost 15. I'm not a child.

21:15.859 --> 21:18.612
Yeah, well, legally you're a child
until you're 18.

21:18.695 --> 21:21.198
Mom, you know what I mean.

21:22.074 --> 21:25.994
Okay, fine. I will make you a deal.
If the power comes back on,

21:26.078 --> 21:28.247
I want you home
in the morning before school,

21:28.330 --> 21:30.832
and I don't wanna hear
about how tired you are

21:30.916 --> 21:34.419
-or about how you didn't get enough sleep.
-Oh, my God! Okay, okay. Yes, deal.

21:35.045 --> 21:36.296
Deal, okay.

21:36.922 --> 21:39.383
You should probably leave
before we change our minds.

21:39.466 --> 21:41.426
-Yeah. Thank you.
-Yeah, go. Go.

21:41.510 --> 21:42.886
-Thank you.
-Go.

21:42.970 --> 21:44.972
-Go. Run, run.
-Okay.

21:48.851 --> 21:49.935
Where you going?

21:50.477 --> 21:52.020
Sleepover at Jessica's.

21:53.939 --> 21:54.940
Okay.

21:56.316 --> 21:57.317
Cool.

21:59.278 --> 22:00.362
Have fun.

22:03.407 --> 22:04.575
I'll miss you.

22:14.042 --> 22:16.670
Hey, Kim. Hi.

22:16.753 --> 22:20.257
Hi, hey. You here to hoard food and water?

22:20.340 --> 22:23.218
Well, you guessed it. Yeah.

22:23.969 --> 22:25.971
You know what, I have something for you.

22:27.222 --> 22:28.223
Here.

22:28.724 --> 22:32.352
I wrote up a cease and desist letter
for every villager with a pitchfork,

22:32.436 --> 22:35.439
along with, like,
every member of the school board.

22:36.315 --> 22:37.858
You even stamped them all.

22:38.275 --> 22:41.570
Oh, yeah. It basically just says
that we are gonna sue them

22:41.653 --> 22:44.406
for a whole bunch of stuff
if they don't leave you alone.

22:44.489 --> 22:47.910
This petition to get you fired,
this is your mom's fault, okay?

22:48.493 --> 22:49.661
Not yours.

22:49.745 --> 22:52.164
So I wanna put this thing to bed for good.

22:55.209 --> 22:56.627
Don't hate me, just--

23:01.131 --> 23:02.341
I don't hate you.

23:03.091 --> 23:05.177
-I think I love you.
-Really?

23:05.260 --> 23:06.803
-Thank you.
-Yes.

23:07.387 --> 23:10.057
-Yeah, I know. It's been a day.
-I will see you later.

23:10.140 --> 23:11.600
-See you.
-Bye.

23:20.609 --> 23:22.277
There we go.

23:26.365 --> 23:29.243
Please tell me you found something
on Wott Management?

23:29.326 --> 23:31.203
-Hilde--
-Well, how am I supposed to work

23:31.286 --> 23:34.373
if there's no Internet
and you're not telling me anything?

23:34.790 --> 23:36.375
Yeah, well, you're not.

23:36.458 --> 23:38.544
'Cause for the billionth time,

23:38.627 --> 23:41.463
you are supposed to be focusing
on your schoolwork.

23:46.093 --> 23:49.471
Anyway, how's your bird?
How's Walter doing?

23:52.015 --> 23:53.016
What?

23:54.977 --> 23:57.437
What? I'm not deflecting.

23:57.938 --> 23:59.523
You're on your third cup of coffee,

23:59.606 --> 24:01.650
and you've been writing
for 40 minutes straight.

24:01.733 --> 24:04.987
You've obviously found something.
Just tell me what it is.

24:06.238 --> 24:07.781
All right, look, I've--

24:09.366 --> 24:12.452
I've tracked down some
of Wott's financial records

24:12.536 --> 24:16.206
and I'm getting closer to finding
some transacting businesses, so...

24:16.290 --> 24:19.209
Could this explain why they want
to buy Trip's dad's farm?

24:19.626 --> 24:20.627
I don't know.

24:20.711 --> 24:22.671
Could this have anything
to do with Richie?

24:22.754 --> 24:24.840
Oh, for God's sake, would you just stop?

24:26.133 --> 24:30.512
I'm sorry, sweetie, but you have to
leave the Richie Fife thing alone.

24:30.596 --> 24:31.597
I'm sorry.

24:31.680 --> 24:36.643
Remember when you told me
that Pop-Pop didn't believe you

24:36.727 --> 24:38.604
and that's why you two broke apart?

24:40.105 --> 24:41.523
Yeah, yeah.

24:43.066 --> 24:45.152
Please don't do that to me.

24:47.613 --> 24:49.531
I don't wanna break apart from you.

25:03.962 --> 25:06.173
-Hey, man.
-Hey, Frank.

25:07.049 --> 25:08.842
I was just stopping by to say...

25:10.052 --> 25:11.053
hey.

25:11.136 --> 25:12.596
You wanna come in?

25:12.679 --> 25:14.431
-Oh, yeah.
-Yeah, come in, man. Come in.

25:15.682 --> 25:16.683
What happened here?

25:16.767 --> 25:20.145
Yeah, dude, we had a tree
come right through the window.

25:20.229 --> 25:21.647
-Total disaster.
-Thank you.

25:21.730 --> 25:23.524
-We had glass, came in all in the--
-Well--

25:23.607 --> 25:26.276
-Right. You want me to take a look at it?
-Yeah, yeah. Come in.

25:26.360 --> 25:27.486
No, no, it's all over the floor.

25:31.448 --> 25:33.283
I can't believe the power's still out.

25:33.951 --> 25:37.496
Okay, ladies. I am going upstairs.

25:37.579 --> 25:39.122
If anybody's hungry or thirsty,

25:39.206 --> 25:41.416
there's plenty of stuff
in the kitchen, okay?

25:41.500 --> 25:42.835
-Thanks, Miss Fife.
-Thanks, Mom.

25:42.918 --> 25:44.461
Well, then you guys have fun.

25:44.545 --> 25:46.255
You, little rascal.

25:48.131 --> 25:49.758
-Good night.
-Thank you.

25:53.679 --> 25:56.014
Okay, you guys heard my mom.

25:56.098 --> 25:58.976
If we're thirsty,
we should get something to drink.

26:03.605 --> 26:04.731
Yes!

26:06.608 --> 26:07.901
Okay, who wants to go first?

26:07.985 --> 26:09.403
-Me!
-Oh, my gosh.

26:09.486 --> 26:12.072
Warrior of the month. She gets the most.

26:14.199 --> 26:17.202
-Oh, yeah, she needs it.
-Two, three.

26:17.286 --> 26:18.996
-Can I have more? More.
-More? Okay.

26:19.788 --> 26:21.206
Oh, my God! You're crazy.

26:22.708 --> 26:24.126
Thank you.

26:24.918 --> 26:26.545
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

26:27.880 --> 26:30.340
Hey, listen,
thanks for having my dad at your place.

26:30.424 --> 26:32.426
You know,
just till we get our power back on.

26:32.509 --> 26:35.971
Don't worry. It's been good seeing him.

26:36.054 --> 26:37.598
Yeah, well, how's your dad?

26:38.223 --> 26:41.643
I have not seen him in a while.
You know, what's he been up to since--

26:41.727 --> 26:43.145
Since your daughter got him fired?

26:43.562 --> 26:44.855
Come on. She did not.

26:46.356 --> 26:48.400
No, come on. No, no, no, I'm kidding.

26:48.483 --> 26:50.194
Yeah, he's working security somewhere.

26:50.277 --> 26:53.155
And then Mayor Fife died,
and I think that hit him pretty hard.

26:54.323 --> 26:56.241
You know, the first one
of the guys his age to pass away.

26:56.325 --> 26:57.492
You think?

26:58.243 --> 26:59.328
Yeah, I don't know.

27:00.037 --> 27:02.456
I heard he was toying
with the idea of running for mayor,

27:02.539 --> 27:04.666
and then they got that guy
in the interim to step in,

27:04.750 --> 27:07.169
so I never heard anything else about it.

27:08.545 --> 27:10.631
And we're not talking that much
these days so...

27:10.714 --> 27:12.633
Yeah, well, I know how that goes.

27:13.759 --> 27:17.763
Just don't let it go on too long.
It's not worth it.

27:36.073 --> 27:37.157
Come here.

27:38.492 --> 27:41.328
All right. Time to feed you.

27:45.249 --> 27:48.001
Feeding you. You hungry?

27:48.669 --> 27:51.964
Yup, Mr. Wergeles said
I need to feed you every hour.

27:52.798 --> 27:54.007
Want water first?

28:26.206 --> 28:29.084
Hey, are you doing okay?

28:29.168 --> 28:32.045
Yeah, I heard voices
and I know Izzy's not here, so.

28:34.423 --> 28:35.674
I'm talking to Walter.

28:36.884 --> 28:39.678
Yes, of course. How's he doing?

28:40.804 --> 28:42.306
Is he doing okay?

28:45.392 --> 28:46.393
Yeah.

28:53.567 --> 28:56.278
Hey, are you sure you're up for this?

28:56.361 --> 28:58.906
You know, if you want,
I could do a couple of feedings.

28:59.823 --> 29:02.534
Yeah, you could get some sleep
for like three hours straight.

29:02.618 --> 29:04.620
I used to do that with you
when you were a baby,

29:04.703 --> 29:05.787
you know, with your mom.

29:05.871 --> 29:07.372
Thanks, but I wanna do it.

29:09.124 --> 29:12.252
I would wake up anyways
because I need to know he's okay.

29:13.629 --> 29:15.631
Yeah, well, your mom used to say that too.

29:19.009 --> 29:20.010
Listen, I just...

29:21.512 --> 29:24.223
I wanna say that I am sorry,

29:24.306 --> 29:28.769
and I also wanna say that I believe you.

29:29.353 --> 29:30.354
What?

29:30.979 --> 29:33.982
Well, you know, if you say
you feel like someone is watching you,

29:34.066 --> 29:35.234
well, I believe you.

29:36.068 --> 29:38.529
And if you think
that someone might be Richie, well...

29:39.780 --> 29:41.323
well, I do, I believe you.

29:43.909 --> 29:46.745
Yeah, I think I was just scared
to talk to you about him 'cause...

29:48.622 --> 29:51.834
you know,
sometimes I feel like I see him too.

29:54.044 --> 29:57.130
But I can't. I mean, that can't be real.

30:00.259 --> 30:01.301
Incoming.

30:02.427 --> 30:03.428
Come here.

30:06.890 --> 30:08.016
I forgive you.

30:09.101 --> 30:10.561
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

30:10.644 --> 30:11.770
Thank you.

30:12.479 --> 30:13.522
Dad...

30:14.439 --> 30:16.483
thanks for always talking to me like that.

30:16.567 --> 30:20.279
You know, I used to think
that everybody was like you and Mom.

30:20.904 --> 30:25.659
But then I realized that most parents
don't treat their kids like real people.

30:27.411 --> 30:29.663
I wish more kids had someone like you.

30:30.622 --> 30:32.332
-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah.

30:32.416 --> 30:34.459
You know, you're pretty awesome too.

30:34.543 --> 30:35.544
Really?

30:35.627 --> 30:37.421
Yeah, but you know
what would be more awesome?

30:37.504 --> 30:40.465
-What? I want to talk to Walter.
-The most awesome thing of all time.

30:40.549 --> 30:42.509
Walter is sleeping. You have to sleep too.

30:42.593 --> 30:44.303
Good night. I love you.

30:45.220 --> 30:46.430
Night, sweetheart.

30:49.933 --> 30:51.518
Look, you sure you don't want me to take--

30:51.602 --> 30:53.228
No. Nope, no.

30:53.312 --> 30:54.605
-No, thank you.
-Okay, okay.

30:57.149 --> 30:58.567
Go to sleep.

31:08.118 --> 31:12.164
Wait, you're hanging out
with Jessica Fife?

31:12.247 --> 31:13.582
Like, at her house?

31:14.333 --> 31:15.417
Yeah, I know.

31:15.501 --> 31:19.379
It's, like, super weird,
but, like, not weird at all.

31:19.463 --> 31:22.716
What, the last time I saw you together,
you punched her in the face.

31:22.799 --> 31:26.845
Yeah, I know, but,
well, it's different now.

31:28.472 --> 31:32.684
God, everyone here is drinking too.
I mean, I'm not, but...

31:32.768 --> 31:33.769
That's cool.

31:33.852 --> 31:36.230
I mean, not really.

31:36.313 --> 31:37.981
I meant that you're not drinking.

31:38.941 --> 31:40.734
Yeah, yeah. I mean, I guess.

31:42.528 --> 31:44.404
I really wish you were here right now.

31:45.864 --> 31:48.909
I mean, not like, here in Jess's house,
but you know, like...

31:48.992 --> 31:50.202
Yeah, me too.

31:53.539 --> 31:54.540
Look, I--

31:54.873 --> 31:58.752
San Francisco's a great city,
but I kinda hate it.

31:58.836 --> 32:01.463
'Cause, you know, you're not here.

32:03.799 --> 32:05.592
I really miss you, Iz.

32:16.770 --> 32:20.816
That's so sweet. Puppy love.

32:22.067 --> 32:23.068
Yeah. Hey.

32:23.485 --> 32:26.280
Hey, Ethan. Really, I think I should go.

32:26.363 --> 32:29.366
Okay, well, have fun
and, like, be careful.

32:29.449 --> 32:31.785
-Yeah. Bye.
-Bye.

32:38.292 --> 32:40.544
-Long-distance?
-What?

32:40.627 --> 32:45.174
Nothing. Just ignore them.
It's just out of sight, out of mind.

32:45.257 --> 32:47.176
Yeah, well, Ethan's not like that, so...

32:50.304 --> 32:52.306
Well, has he told you he loves you?

32:53.390 --> 32:54.516
What? No.

32:54.600 --> 32:57.436
And you haven't told him that you love him

32:57.519 --> 32:59.813
because you are afraid
he won't say it back to you.

33:02.774 --> 33:03.859
You know. I just...

33:07.613 --> 33:09.531
I just wish he'd stayed in Erie Harbor.

33:09.615 --> 33:10.616
Iz.

33:11.783 --> 33:13.202
God. This is so embarrassing.

33:14.077 --> 33:15.537
-No, it's not.
-It's okay, girl.

33:15.621 --> 33:16.622
Sorry.

33:17.998 --> 33:20.709
-Sorry.
-You know what?

33:20.792 --> 33:21.793
What?

33:22.336 --> 33:23.587
I think I need a drink.

33:23.670 --> 33:25.422
-You need a drink?
-Yeah.

33:25.506 --> 33:27.257
-Okay.
-Okay.

33:28.258 --> 33:30.385
Wait, so you're, like, a freshman, right?

33:32.137 --> 33:33.847
She does not need a drink.

33:33.931 --> 33:36.225
No. What? No, no, I want one. It's fine.

33:36.308 --> 33:38.227
-Are you sure?
-Yeah.

33:39.019 --> 33:40.521
Yeah, yeah, I'm sure.

33:40.604 --> 33:42.022
-Thank you.
-Okay.

33:44.858 --> 33:48.862
If he doesn't know what he's got,
then too bad.

33:50.614 --> 33:52.032
Cheers.

33:56.203 --> 33:57.829
Oh, God!

33:57.913 --> 33:59.790
It really does not vibe
with hot chocolate.

34:00.207 --> 34:02.251
No, or, like, with anything.

34:02.334 --> 34:05.045
-Yeah.
-I'll never be sick of this song.

34:06.421 --> 34:09.091
They don't know your boyfriend. You do.

34:09.174 --> 34:11.802
Don't let what they're saying
get inside your head like that, okay?

34:11.885 --> 34:12.886
Girls can get, like...

34:13.846 --> 34:17.224
Yeah. No, yeah, totally. Thanks.

34:17.306 --> 34:19.601
Okay, who's ready for round two?

34:22.187 --> 34:24.188
-Blame it on the juice
-Juice

34:25.065 --> 34:27.860
Ain't my fault
That I'm out here gettin' loose

34:27.943 --> 34:29.902
I'm the pudding in the proof

34:29.987 --> 34:31.737
Gotta blame it on the Goose

34:36.702 --> 34:39.580
Blame it on my juice

35:02.436 --> 35:04.771
See, buddy? I told you you'd be okay.

35:06.398 --> 35:07.900
Hey, Walter.

35:09.359 --> 35:10.861
Wanna come to work with me?

35:13.697 --> 35:14.698
Right.

35:17.451 --> 35:22.372
So, Walter, what are we gonna do today?
Write a story or mark down bullet points?

35:22.456 --> 35:25.667
Think we should do that first, right?
Always smarter.

35:37.387 --> 35:40.432
Okay, good news. Power's back on,

35:40.516 --> 35:43.143
so school is open today.

35:43.227 --> 35:45.062
Already heard, already published.

35:45.145 --> 35:49.566
Hey, look, by the way,
I found an address on Wott Management.

35:49.650 --> 35:51.944
Hey, you don't think they had
something to do with the break-in

35:52.027 --> 35:53.612
at my office, do you?

35:55.697 --> 35:58.408
-Oh, hey, there she is.
-Hey, how did you get home?

35:59.368 --> 36:00.869
-I walked.
-Walked?

36:02.621 --> 36:04.164
-What--
-Really? You have fun?

36:04.915 --> 36:06.208
-Yeah.
-Are you-- Hey, hold up.

36:06.625 --> 36:07.709
Are you okay?

36:07.793 --> 36:09.294
Mom, yeah, I just don't feel good.

36:09.378 --> 36:10.712
Well, are you sick?

36:10.796 --> 36:13.006
-Please. Mom, I'm fine.
-You don't look fine.

36:13.090 --> 36:14.758
She looks like she's gonna puke.

36:15.676 --> 36:18.178
And if you do, save it
because I can give it to Walter.

36:18.595 --> 36:21.223
Iz, what's going on?
Come on, you smell like a frat house.

36:21.306 --> 36:22.558
You know, honey.

36:22.641 --> 36:24.935
Why don't you go upstairs
and get ready for school, okay?

36:25.018 --> 36:27.354
And, hey, Ginny,
can you go with her, sweetie?

36:27.437 --> 36:28.730
Thanks, Gin.

36:31.233 --> 36:34.862
Guys, look,
I just want my bed, please? Okay.

36:34.945 --> 36:37.197
No. No, not okay.

36:37.823 --> 36:39.241
Were you drinking?

36:39.324 --> 36:40.617
-Mom, no.
-Really?

36:40.701 --> 36:42.286
-Come on, we both know that you were.
-Izzy?

36:42.369 --> 36:44.663
Guys, please,
I just need my bed right now.

36:44.746 --> 36:46.957
No. No, no bed.

36:47.040 --> 36:50.419
No. We have school.
It's a school day, and you made a promise.

36:50.502 --> 36:53.338
So you're gonna go upstairs
and get yourself ready for school.

36:53.422 --> 36:54.423
All right, look.

36:55.048 --> 36:57.968
Drink this. And then when you're done
with that, you drink it again,

36:58.051 --> 37:00.554
and then when you're done with that,
you drink it again.

37:00.637 --> 37:03.974
This is not the end of the conversation,
this is just the beginning.

37:04.057 --> 37:06.185
I wanna talk to you
about this after school.

37:06.268 --> 37:09.396
We want to talk to you,
but later when you're feeling better.

37:10.397 --> 37:11.523
Yeah, okay.

37:55.442 --> 37:57.569
So I'm not gonna ask them
anything directly,

37:57.653 --> 38:00.280
-I just wanna get a feel for the place.
-Okay.

38:02.282 --> 38:04.910
I don't know why,
but something doesn't feel right.

38:16.839 --> 38:18.215
Hey, you wanna try that one?

38:44.241 --> 38:46.660
There's only one thing I'm allergic to.

38:46.743 --> 38:48.620
A specific strain of bulrushes.

38:49.204 --> 38:51.498
There's only one place
of Erie Harbor that has them.

38:55.085 --> 38:56.128
Oh, my God!

38:57.296 --> 38:59.047
First the birds, now the fish?

39:15.939 --> 39:16.940
Hello!

39:33.415 --> 39:35.167
-Just...
-Hey, who are you calling?

39:35.250 --> 39:36.502
Wott Management.

40:25.509 --> 40:28.595
-Something is going on.
-I think you're right.

40:28.679 --> 40:30.430
My contact at animal control said

40:30.514 --> 40:32.641
there was no incident reported
at Woodruff Mansion,

40:32.724 --> 40:35.978
-but that doesn't make any sense.
-Neither does this.

40:51.910 --> 40:53.036
Did you guys see that?

40:53.704 --> 40:54.746
See what?

40:58.041 --> 40:59.042
Nothing.

41:00.752 --> 41:03.213
So, what could this mean?

41:05.174 --> 41:09.344
Means I need to get you kids out of here.
Come on. Go.

41:17.477 --> 41:18.729
Hilde, come on.
