after having his love
spurned.

08:47.345 --> 08:48.411
He said it
just like this.

08:48.413 --> 08:50.313
Like -- like,
when he's in the drama zone.

08:50.315 --> 08:54.450

You look sad.

09:12.971 --> 09:14.838
We really messed up
this time.

09:14.840 --> 09:18.508
Because of us,
Jamie's feeling lower than ever.

09:18.510 --> 09:20.476
We've shattered the man!

09:20.478 --> 09:22.312
He'll never love again!

09:22.314 --> 09:23.980
I'll go talk to him.

09:23.982 --> 09:26.482
But your words
will destroy him!

At the very least, you have to

09:59.017 --> 10:04.187
And you <i>literally</i> have no idea
who or what I am.

10:04.189 --> 10:09.392
But I bloom for you, like --
like a camellia under moonlight.

10:09.394 --> 10:11.261
No, you don't!

10:12.296 --> 10:15.431
You make a very convincing
