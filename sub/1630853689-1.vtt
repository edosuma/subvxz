02:06.877 --> 02:08.003
Huh?

02:08.045 --> 02:10.840
V, you there?

02:10.881 --> 02:14.677
-V. V?
-Where'd she go?
Mid lane's totally open.

02:14.718 --> 02:16.804
-She ghosting us?
-What is she doing?

02:16.846 --> 02:18.639
Totally asleep at the wheel.

02:18.681 --> 02:20.558
Hello?

02:20.599 --> 02:22.309
-V?

02:35.656 --> 02:37.449
Good morning.

02:37.491 --> 02:40.160
-Indy!
-Sorry I didn't wake you.
You looked so cozy

02:40.202 --> 02:42.288
sleeping through one
of your fantasy beatings.

02:44.707 --> 02:46.876
Oh, um, wanna go to
a silent disco tonight?

02:46.917 --> 02:49.628
We get high, it'll be just like
a regular disco.

02:49.670 --> 02:51.839
I have practice.

02:51.881 --> 02:54.967
-Do you ever stop playing?
-Only to eat and sleep.

02:55.009 --> 02:57.261
Okay. Well, never say
I didn't try to get you laid.

02:58.012 --> 03:00.014
Oh, breakfast brownie?

03:00.055 --> 03:01.765
-Oh, okay.
-Made them myself.

03:01.807 --> 03:05.769
Cocoa, hazelnut, psilocybin.

03:05.811 --> 03:08.397
-Oh, low-key bitter, right?
-Low-key laced-with-shrooms!

03:08.439 --> 03:09.982
I can't be tripping
in class, Indy.

03:10.024 --> 03:11.567

A princess and a plumber?
I'm sorry.

04:23.138 --> 04:25.641
-In this economy,
it's not happening.
-Hey.

04:25.683 --> 04:26.850
-Oh, hey.
-What'd I miss?

04:26.892 --> 04:28.268
The attendance sheet.

04:28.310 --> 04:29.645
-Really?

04:29.687 --> 04:31.438
All right, settle down.

04:31.480 --> 04:32.773
Settle down.

04:35.234 --> 04:37.945
The history of video games
stretches far back

04:37.987 --> 04:39.905
to the early 1950's.

04:39.947 --> 04:42.908
Novelty simulations by
adventurous students

04:42.950 --> 04:46.704
inadvertently formed
the foundation of what is now

04:46.745 --> 04:50.416
a several-hundred-billion-dollar
industry.

04:50.457 --> 04:53.627
Before characters like
Donkey Kong, Sonic,

04:53.669 --> 04:56.338
and Tomb Raider
graced our screens.

04:56.380 --> 04:57.965
Lara Croft is smoking.

04:59.633 --> 05:00.968
Tits.

05:01.885 --> 05:03.846
-What's your name?
-Todd.

05:03.887 --> 05:07.850
Todd. You're talking about
her animated endowments?

05:07.891 --> 05:09.601
I guess so.

05:09.643 --> 05:12.479
Well, that is actually
the point of her design.

05:12.521 --> 05:15.983
It wasn't long ago that games
were marketed entirely

05:16.025 --> 05:17.651
to a generation of guys.

05:17.693 --> 05:19.945
How many of you have played
Assassin's Creed?

05:21.613 --> 05:25.034
The publishers decided that
playing as a female character

05:25.075 --> 05:27.953
made the game un-relatable.

05:27.995 --> 05:31.999
So gamers could not
relate to this,

05:32.041 --> 05:35.085
but they could relate to this?

05:36.712 --> 05:38.338
But here's the thing,

05:38.380 --> 05:40.924
as the gaming industry
exploded in sales,

05:40.966 --> 05:45.095
the profile of a traditional
gamer has dramatically changed.

05:45.137 --> 05:47.973
And now, gamers are everyone.

05:49.058 --> 05:51.310
-Even Todd.

05:51.351 --> 05:55.564
So when some of you
decide to make games
of your own,

05:55.606 --> 05:59.359
for the love of God,
please consider giving

05:59.401 --> 06:03.072
your female characters
a pair of pants.

06:03.113 --> 06:05.115
Or regular-sized tits!

06:06.742 --> 06:08.410
Bingo!

06:08.452 --> 06:11.538
I'm Parker Nesby
and this is the history

06:11.580 --> 06:13.248
of video games.

06:13.290 --> 06:15.292
Parker Nesby,
I know that name.

06:18.879 --> 06:21.090
All right, all right,
and now with just the starters.

06:21.131 --> 06:22.758
Yo, out support!

06:22.800 --> 06:25.094
Out of here.

06:25.135 --> 06:27.721
Okay, yo. All right,
I'm gonna stand like--
All right, you guys,

06:27.763 --> 06:29.598
right here, right here, okay?

06:29.640 --> 06:31.058
Smile,

06:31.100 --> 06:33.477
raise your eyebrows,
stop smiling.

06:33.519 --> 06:36.897
-That's your model face.
-Who opened the toolbox?

06:36.939 --> 06:38.732
All right, cool,
just like some singles now.
Like of me.

06:38.774 --> 06:40.442
-Solo, that's a single.
-Oh.

06:40.484 --> 06:41.527
-Single, me.
-Okay.

06:41.568 --> 06:43.028
Like, you know.

06:43.070 --> 06:45.155
Just like a little bit quicker.

06:45.197 --> 06:46.740
Dabbing is not a thing anymore.

06:46.782 --> 06:48.367
Okay, dabbing is still a thing,

06:48.408 --> 06:50.119
and literally everyone
can hear you.

06:50.160 --> 06:52.454
Oh, Ricardo, why aren't you
in the photo?

06:57.668 --> 06:59.920
Like, if you catch the muscle
on accident.

06:59.962 --> 07:02.131
Oh, who's this?
Oh. Who's that?

07:02.172 --> 07:03.632
Miami's on line.

07:03.674 --> 07:05.175
Two minutes to game time.

07:05.217 --> 07:07.302
-No mercy, boys.
-Whoo.

07:07.344 --> 07:09.429
I might have to sit
this one out, Captain.

07:09.471 --> 07:11.515
I think I flexed my thumb
too hard in the warm-up.

07:11.557 --> 07:12.683
Let me take a look.

07:16.311 --> 07:18.647
Oh, oh.

07:18.689 --> 07:20.107
How's that feel?

07:20.149 --> 07:21.733
Has he ever touched you
like that?

07:21.775 --> 07:23.277
-One to ten.
-Oh.

07:23.318 --> 07:25.362
Ugh, he will never touch me
like that.

07:25.404 --> 07:26.488
Eleven.

07:30.200 --> 07:31.660
-V!
-Yeah?

07:31.702 --> 07:32.911
You're in!

07:32.953 --> 07:35.873
-Oh, my God!

07:35.914 --> 07:39.084
Okay, change of personnel,
but we stick to the plan.

07:39.126 --> 07:40.919
Points are great,
but they only matter

07:40.961 --> 07:42.629
in tournament seeding.

07:42.671 --> 07:44.590
Destroy the orb,
get the win.

07:44.631 --> 07:46.675
V, you run support.

07:46.717 --> 07:47.759
Don't screw it up.

07:48.927 --> 07:51.138
Betas on three!
One, two, three!

07:51.180 --> 07:52.264
-Betas!
-Betas!

08:01.899 --> 08:04.401
An allied tower
is under attack.

08:19.666 --> 08:21.335
Dustin! They're flanking us.

08:21.376 --> 08:23.420
I know what I'm doing, support!

08:23.462 --> 08:26.215
Then stop face-checking
and let our casters blast
at range.

08:32.179 --> 08:34.514
V, I need a heal over here.

08:34.556 --> 08:36.266
Okay, I'll be there in a second.

08:37.893 --> 08:39.269
Yup, my girl.

08:39.311 --> 08:40.270
Yeah.

08:40.938 --> 08:42.940
No, no, no, ugh!

08:42.981 --> 08:45.484
Dustin, pay attention.
I need to heal the others too.

08:45.525 --> 08:47.986
Quit squawking over the comms
and let me run this.

08:48.028 --> 08:49.821
V, seriously, chill.

08:49.863 --> 08:52.324
She's literally keeping
your boy in the game, Ricardo!

08:52.366 --> 08:54.243
Whoo! I am crushing last hits.

09:00.332 --> 09:03.252
-I'm wasted. They got behind me.

09:03.293 --> 09:05.379
Everyone, listen up,
they're outflanking us.

09:05.420 --> 09:06.463
Charge straight up the middle.

09:06.505 --> 09:09.216
Just said that.

09:11.343 --> 09:13.679
I need a heal.

09:13.720 --> 09:15.973
Running support means more than
just healing you, Dustin.

09:16.014 --> 09:17.307
Everyone else is dead.

09:22.396 --> 09:24.690
The enemy has been slayed.

09:25.607 --> 09:27.276
The power is mine.

09:35.534 --> 09:37.244
Oh, victory!

09:38.829 --> 09:40.455
That's what I'm talking about.

09:40.497 --> 09:41.999
Yeah!

09:42.833 --> 09:44.751
And that's how it's done.

09:44.793 --> 09:47.421
-Suck it, Miami!
-But we almost lost.

09:47.462 --> 09:49.631
You're not always gonna be
so lucky.

09:49.673 --> 09:52.175
V, I know you think you know
what you're doing,

09:52.217 --> 09:53.677
but you have a lot
to learn, okay.

09:53.719 --> 09:56.680
And you will, from the bench.

09:56.722 --> 10:00.183
Seriously?
I'm a nationally ranked player!

10:00.225 --> 10:01.935
With far more skill
than most of you.

10:01.977 --> 10:03.270
That's not remotely true.

10:03.312 --> 10:04.730
It's kinda true.

10:04.771 --> 10:06.356
Look, Dustin,

10:06.398 --> 10:08.483
I need to have
a role on this team.

10:08.525 --> 10:12.070
You are support.

10:12.112 --> 10:14.072
If you earn a better position,
I'll give you one,

10:14.114 --> 10:16.450
but considering we're
the reigning collegiate champs,

10:16.491 --> 10:17.951
I'd say we're good as is.

10:17.993 --> 10:19.745
Everyone let's just be cool.

10:19.786 --> 10:21.413
We're all on the same team.

10:21.455 --> 10:24.958
-I don't know. Are we?
-Whoa, easy, V.

10:25.000 --> 10:27.794
Don't get all emotional,
'cause I'm not giving you
special treatment.

10:27.836 --> 10:31.423
Special treatment?
I earned my gaming scholarship,
because I'm a good gamer.

10:31.465 --> 10:33.717
Oh, hate to break it to you, V,
but the only reason

10:33.759 --> 10:36.470
you have a spot on this team
is because you guys have...

10:39.514 --> 10:42.684
-You know, vaginas.
-What?

10:42.726 --> 10:44.811
I actually uh--
I think it's vulvas, Dustin.

10:44.853 --> 10:46.813
Yeah, come again.

10:46.855 --> 10:48.940
Yup, vagina is just
the birth canal

10:48.982 --> 10:50.650
and the vulva
is the all-encompassing--

10:50.692 --> 10:51.735
Owen, please.

10:51.777 --> 10:53.653
Vaginas.

10:54.529 --> 10:55.906
I'm done.

10:55.947 --> 10:57.741
-V, come on.
-No, I'm done!

10:57.783 --> 10:59.076
Oh, you quit?

10:59.743 --> 11:02.120
-Oh.
-I quit!

11:02.162 --> 11:04.247
Do not touch that, Owen!

11:04.289 --> 11:07.626
You all have
some serious issues.
I'm out, too.

11:09.169 --> 11:12.589
Wow! I've never witnessed
live-action PMS.

11:14.883 --> 11:16.009
Clean up all that crap, Owen.

11:25.394 --> 11:27.813
-V, wait.
-Not now, Sloane.

11:27.854 --> 11:29.022
I'm done.

11:32.401 --> 11:34.736
Come on, Barrett.
Let me hear you!

11:48.417 --> 11:49.543
You're freaking me out!

11:50.252 --> 11:52.921
Please stop yelling.

11:52.963 --> 11:55.048
You've been sitting here
comatose for like an hour

11:55.090 --> 11:56.508
and I'm really worried about
your aura.

11:56.550 --> 11:58.385
It's usually like
a bright purple,

11:58.427 --> 12:00.637
-but right now it's like...
-My aura's fine.

12:00.679 --> 12:02.264
Come dance with me.
Let's go.

12:02.305 --> 12:03.598
Wasn't getting me out
of the dorm

12:03.640 --> 12:05.183
victory enough for you?

12:05.225 --> 12:07.394
Yes, but now you need
to move your body.

12:07.436 --> 12:09.521
Feel the energy of
this magical place.

12:09.563 --> 12:11.231
This is the cafeteria.

12:11.273 --> 12:13.108
Suit yourself.

12:22.742 --> 12:24.578
-Boo!
-Oh, Owen. Hi.

12:24.619 --> 12:26.580
V, it's good to see you.

12:26.621 --> 12:31.001
Hey, I'm-- I'm sorry
about earlier today.

12:31.042 --> 12:32.461
Sometimes Dustin can be--

12:32.502 --> 12:33.753
A real dick-bag.

12:33.795 --> 12:35.338
Yeah, and it's all the time.

12:35.380 --> 12:37.132
Like 24/7.

12:37.174 --> 12:39.759
So, where are the rest
of your Betas?

12:39.801 --> 12:43.388
Shocking, but I don't actually
hang with them much.

12:43.430 --> 12:46.224
I'm just, you know,
riding it out
for the scholarship.

12:46.266 --> 12:48.059
Oh.

12:48.101 --> 12:50.604
Oh yeah! Whoo!

12:50.645 --> 12:52.606
Ooh!

12:52.647 --> 12:54.399
That's my roommate.

12:54.441 --> 12:57.903
Oh, um, I'm gonna grab a juice.

12:57.944 --> 12:59.696
Can I-- Can I get you one?

12:59.738 --> 13:02.908
You know what?
I'm-- I'm just gonna go.

13:02.949 --> 13:06.953
It's just been a long week
and I'm exhausted.

13:06.995 --> 13:08.747
Okay. Cool.

13:08.788 --> 13:13.168
Yeah, well-- well,
I shall see you later, V.

13:13.210 --> 13:14.878
Yeah.

13:14.920 --> 13:16.463
-Bye.
-Bye.

13:19.799 --> 13:21.760
Thank you for shopping
at Game Home.

13:27.474 --> 13:29.768
Figured I'd you find you
working the hole.

13:29.809 --> 13:31.895
You know me,
I'm always working the hole.

13:31.937 --> 13:34.439
-Life goals, baby.

13:34.481 --> 13:37.025
You know I would like to
confirm that your manager

13:37.067 --> 13:39.861
makes me thirst.

13:39.903 --> 13:42.656
Lewis? Gets Cheetos stuck
in his beard all the time

13:42.697 --> 13:44.241
and says things like "ill".

13:44.282 --> 13:47.118
He let me cut the line
for PS5 though.

13:47.160 --> 13:49.120
I think I really messed up.

13:49.162 --> 13:51.665
Me quitting the team has made
my whole life go poof.

13:51.706 --> 13:53.416
I hear you, girl.
I'm in the same boat.

13:53.458 --> 13:56.044
Those assholes ruined gaming
for me too.

13:56.086 --> 13:57.587
-Yo!

13:57.629 --> 13:58.880
Hey, you kids wanna see
something ill?

13:58.922 --> 14:00.423
-No, we do not.
-Maybe.

14:00.465 --> 14:02.425
Guess who's an influencer now?

14:02.467 --> 14:03.760
This guy.

14:03.802 --> 14:07.722
Do you enjoy my balls?
Subscribe.

14:07.764 --> 14:09.975
Shall you take my elder orbs
into your mouth hole.

14:10.016 --> 14:11.434
Come on, it's brilliant.

14:11.476 --> 14:13.645
Lewis, can you give us
a second?

14:13.687 --> 14:16.940
-Girl talk.
-Have you been eating
butt cheese again?

14:16.982 --> 14:19.985
Yo, dickwhistle,
wanna see something ill?

14:20.026 --> 14:23.280
Sloane, if I'm not on the team,
I lose my eSports scholarship.

14:23.321 --> 14:25.323
That's the only reason
I can afford to go to Barrett.

14:25.365 --> 14:28.201
You know when life
doesn't go my way,

14:28.243 --> 14:31.329
I usually get really high
and watch Captain Marvel.

14:31.371 --> 14:34.666
-Why?
-Because Brie Larson is
super-freaking hot.

14:34.708 --> 14:37.377
And it's a tremendous setup
to Endgame.

14:38.962 --> 14:42.841
Wait.
What does Captain Marvel do?
In the bad-ass montage?

14:42.882 --> 14:45.385
Oh, she gets back up. Mm-hmm.

14:45.427 --> 14:48.305
-Yes, yes. We get back up.
-Okay.

14:48.346 --> 14:52.017
We are gonna start our own team
and take down the Betas.

14:52.058 --> 14:54.311
-I don't think it's that easy.
-Why not?

14:54.352 --> 14:56.187
What do we need?
Some matching outfits
and a name?

14:56.229 --> 14:58.607
And a team, V. We need players.

14:58.648 --> 15:01.526
Sloane, we're gonna start
an all-girls team.

15:01.568 --> 15:04.863
And kick the living crap
out of those Beta assholes.

15:06.281 --> 15:08.450
Oh. Oh!

15:10.076 --> 15:12.120
-Yes, yes, yes, yeah!
-Yes, yes, yes.

15:15.332 --> 15:16.708
-Huh, what?

15:17.626 --> 15:19.252
Oh...

15:19.294 --> 15:20.337
Come on in.

15:20.378 --> 15:21.796
Hey, you guys.

15:21.838 --> 15:23.715
Welcome. Oh, it's so nice--

15:23.757 --> 15:26.259
No, no, no, no, no.
Don't close the door.

15:26.301 --> 15:28.053
We don't close doors here
at Barrett.

15:28.094 --> 15:31.264
Okay. Oof, all right.

15:31.306 --> 15:34.893
Oh, my gosh,
what a great surprise.

15:34.934 --> 15:37.937
-Hey, have a drink. Yeah.
-Ooh, what's this?

15:37.979 --> 15:39.314
-Kombucha.
-Oh.

15:39.356 --> 15:41.024
And whale sperm.

15:41.066 --> 15:43.485
Supposed to be good
for the skin, yeah.

15:45.028 --> 15:49.824
So, I'm, uh, Dean Davis,
preferred pronouns,
he and him.

15:50.950 --> 15:54.621
Oh, um, um, her/she.

15:54.663 --> 15:56.289
She, Sloane.

15:56.331 --> 15:57.874
Fantastic.

15:57.916 --> 16:00.043
-Come on in, we'll chat.

16:00.085 --> 16:02.170
Have a seat,
we'll talk a little bit.

16:03.380 --> 16:06.800
I just got these fancy things--
Oh, hang on,

16:06.841 --> 16:08.843
Look out, oh, no, no.
Stay where you are.

16:08.885 --> 16:12.389
Don't get up. It's cool.
I just got these, you know.

16:12.430 --> 16:14.766
They're a little tough
to get used to,
but I had one in college.

16:14.808 --> 16:16.851
I don't know how to
use them anymore.

16:16.893 --> 16:20.188
Okay, I think I should
start off by saying this is

16:20.230 --> 16:25.402
a safe space
and anyone in the safe space
will be treated equally.

16:25.443 --> 16:28.697
Uh, we're also being recorded
for liability protection,

16:28.738 --> 16:30.490
mostly mine.

16:30.532 --> 16:34.035
Uh, oh, uh, do I have
your verbal consent on that?

16:34.077 --> 16:35.245
-Yeah.
-Sure.

16:35.286 --> 16:38.206
Great. So, uh...

16:38.248 --> 16:40.500
yeah, what brings you
to my office?

16:40.542 --> 16:42.293
-I said it was
a safe space, right?
-Yeah.

16:42.335 --> 16:43.920
-Yes.
-Okay, good.

16:43.962 --> 16:46.965
Um, so we wanted to propose
the formation

16:47.006 --> 16:51.136
of an all-women's
eSports varsity team.

16:51.177 --> 16:54.264
Really? Oh, that's fun.

16:54.305 --> 16:56.891
Oh, that's great, yeah.

16:56.933 --> 16:58.768
I hear you, I see you.

16:59.853 --> 17:01.646
I'm processing your feelings.

17:01.688 --> 17:03.481
It's okay.

17:07.193 --> 17:09.112
No, no, no.

17:09.154 --> 17:11.364
No, no, no.

17:11.406 --> 17:13.950
All right.

17:13.992 --> 17:18.204
I don't know what's up.
I am losing it.

17:18.246 --> 17:20.206
What's an eSports team?

17:21.666 --> 17:26.045
It's um, like, vid--
Competitive video gaming.

17:26.087 --> 17:29.591
Competitive video gaming,
like Nintendo
and crap like that.

17:29.632 --> 17:31.301
-Yeah.
-That's a sport?

17:31.342 --> 17:32.552
Yeah, we have scholarships.

17:34.512 --> 17:36.806
Oh, I'm telling you.
I don't know
what's what anymore.

17:36.848 --> 17:38.725
I had a kid come in here
just earlier,

17:38.767 --> 17:41.436
telling me
he was pre-triggered.

17:41.478 --> 17:43.563
I don't even know what
"triggered" means.

17:43.605 --> 17:45.857
-Triggered is like
a trauma response--
-I don't care.

17:47.275 --> 17:49.694
I got one year left here.

17:49.736 --> 17:52.989
And my only goal
is to not rock any boats.

17:54.449 --> 17:58.995
And to do that,
I gotta have no change
whatsoever.

17:59.037 --> 18:01.247
We just want a game.

18:01.289 --> 18:04.209
I suppose if I say no,
you're gonna cancel me, right?

18:08.004 --> 18:10.799
I tell you what,
why don't we work together?

18:10.840 --> 18:14.469
We can do that.
Here's what I'm gonna do.

18:14.511 --> 18:16.471
I'm gonna give you
your special little team.

18:16.513 --> 18:20.433
-You will?
-I will, on one condition.

18:20.475 --> 18:25.814
I don't wanna hear you
or see you ever again.

18:27.023 --> 18:28.399
Do we got a deal?

18:30.026 --> 18:31.778
-Yes.
-Yes.

18:31.820 --> 18:33.238
Do you like gaming?

18:33.279 --> 18:34.489
Overwatch?

18:34.531 --> 18:35.782
Animal Crossing!

18:35.824 --> 18:37.575
-Valorant!
-Fortnite!

18:37.617 --> 18:39.285
Last Of Us! Minecraft!

18:39.327 --> 18:42.580
Come to the audition
and join us.

18:42.622 --> 18:44.415
-We are gamer girls.
-We are gamer girls.

18:44.457 --> 18:45.416
Oh!

18:45.458 --> 18:46.793
Gamer girls wanted.

18:46.835 --> 18:48.086
Come to tryouts.

18:48.127 --> 18:49.504
-Join our team.
-Join us.

18:49.546 --> 18:50.922
Hey, girl!
Tell your girlfriends.

18:53.675 --> 18:55.969
So, do you game?

18:56.010 --> 18:57.679
I dig confrontation.

18:59.222 --> 19:01.391
In video games, right?

19:05.687 --> 19:08.231
Fact, you're living
in a giant snow globe.

19:08.273 --> 19:09.983
-Well, actually--
-Fact!

19:10.024 --> 19:13.278
Sir Isaac Newton was
a certified idiot.

19:13.319 --> 19:16.948
Lot-mal mayal Diane.

19:16.990 --> 19:18.449
I think I heard
a "Diane" in there.

19:18.491 --> 19:20.743
Was that Elvish?

19:20.785 --> 19:24.372
One of the many proud languages
of the Elven people.

19:24.414 --> 19:27.333
The Earth is flat!
Show me the curve.

19:27.375 --> 19:28.459
Okay, out!

19:29.210 --> 19:31.212
Okay, Diane, do you game?

19:31.254 --> 19:34.716
100%. I mean, LARPing,
cosplay, role-play.

19:34.757 --> 19:36.593
But do you play Elder Orb?

19:36.634 --> 19:39.262
Do unicorns poop rainbows?

19:40.597 --> 19:43.474
I main as tank support.
I love smashing skulls.

19:43.516 --> 19:44.684
Now we're talking!

19:44.726 --> 19:45.977

a hundred knives!
Like maybe a thousand.

20:07.415 --> 20:11.044
-Welcome to the team.

20:11.085 --> 20:13.254
-What's your name?
-What do you want it to be?

20:14.297 --> 20:15.214
Name me.

20:16.424 --> 20:17.550
Lilly?

20:17.592 --> 20:19.636
Lilly.

20:19.677 --> 20:21.429
Lilly, Lilly.

20:22.388 --> 20:24.557
Lilly.

20:24.599 --> 20:26.267
I like that. That's beautiful.

20:26.309 --> 20:27.727
You guys wanna get tattoos?

20:28.895 --> 20:30.897
You guys wanna get tattoos?
Yes or no?

20:30.939 --> 20:33.232
Our interview process
is so poor.

20:37.654 --> 20:39.572
These aren't even
good dick drawings.

20:39.614 --> 20:42.867
What kind of psycho
puts hair on the shaft?

20:44.786 --> 20:46.955
Oh, Dustin.

20:47.997 --> 20:50.500
Cock, cock, goose.

20:51.668 --> 20:53.962
-Whoo.
-Sweet wheels.

20:54.003 --> 20:57.340
Sorry, I just got axed
by the world's biggest douche!

20:57.382 --> 21:01.386
Well, we know that douche
and we know the best way
to get back at him.

21:03.054 --> 21:04.472
So there's another team?

21:04.514 --> 21:07.016
Mm-hmm, about to be.
So you game?

21:07.058 --> 21:08.935
Whatever keeps my fans happy.

21:08.977 --> 21:11.145
Are you like an influencer
or something?

21:11.187 --> 21:12.814
Do you know any other
crippled sex kittens

21:12.855 --> 21:14.941
-that crush at Elder Orb?
-Ever play on a team?

21:14.983 --> 21:19.028
You're looking at the captain
of my state champion
high school squad, sweetie.

21:21.280 --> 21:23.074
Welcome to the 8-Bits.

21:23.116 --> 21:24.534
Follow us.

21:38.798 --> 21:40.008
Who are you guys?

21:40.049 --> 21:41.759
We are the 8-Bits.

21:41.801 --> 21:43.636
Um, is Parker Nesby here?

21:43.678 --> 21:47.265
Mom, there's some weirdos
at the door for you.

21:47.306 --> 21:52.854
Ace, what'd I say about
opening up the door to--
Oh, uh, what's all this about?

21:52.895 --> 21:55.064
I'm in your History
of Video Games class.

21:56.065 --> 21:57.567
Regular-sized tits.

21:57.608 --> 22:00.028
Ah, yes, I do remember you.

22:00.945 --> 22:02.280
Could we come in?

22:02.321 --> 22:05.158
Uh, I guess.

22:05.199 --> 22:06.868
Hey, hey.

22:09.287 --> 22:12.498
...for the old comfort.
Juice it loose time.

22:12.540 --> 22:15.877
Uh, well, you're
an eclectic bunch, aren't you?

22:15.918 --> 22:18.463
-Shouldn't you all be in school?
-It's Saturday, Mom.

22:18.504 --> 22:20.298
Oh, that's why
I keep you around.

22:20.339 --> 22:23.509
So, is this about
the term paper or--

22:23.551 --> 22:26.220
We are starting an all-girls
eSports team at Barrett.

22:26.262 --> 22:27.847
And we need your help.

22:27.889 --> 22:29.932
Cute. But that's
gonna be a hard no.

22:29.974 --> 22:32.143
Um, I thought you said she was
already on board, V?

22:32.185 --> 22:33.811
Yeah, what's the deal?

22:33.853 --> 22:36.272
I said I think she might be in.

22:36.314 --> 22:39.275
Can we talk? In private?

22:39.317 --> 22:42.320
Mm-hmm, sure.

22:42.361 --> 22:44.030
Can I get a bowl of those?

22:54.290 --> 22:56.334
Coach you?
Wow, no way in hell.

22:56.375 --> 22:58.669
I know who you are.

22:58.711 --> 23:01.005
-I googled you.
-Creepy.

23:01.047 --> 23:03.674
You designed Age of Neutronium.

23:03.716 --> 23:07.053
That's literally the game
that got me into gaming.

23:07.095 --> 23:10.473
That is literally the game that
got me doxxed out of gaming.

23:10.515 --> 23:13.101
I don't need my son opening up
hate mail on the porch anymore.

23:13.142 --> 23:17.021
Listen, I am sorry that
the system sucks for you
and it does,

23:17.063 --> 23:20.525
-but what you want me
to do about it?
-Coach us.

23:20.566 --> 23:23.111
-Why are you so scared to?
-I fear nothing.

23:23.152 --> 23:26.656
-Then we're the same.
-Wonderful.
Then you're gonna be great.

23:26.697 --> 23:29.325
Now grab your oddball friends
and let's end this
home invasion, shall we?

23:29.367 --> 23:31.536
Okay, wait,
you said it yourself,

23:31.577 --> 23:34.163
things are never going to
change unless we make them.

23:34.205 --> 23:36.207
I said that?
It's quite profound.

23:36.249 --> 23:40.169
Look, bottom line is
one gamer girl to another,

23:40.211 --> 23:44.799
I'm on a scholarship
and if I don't have a team,
then I'm a ghost at Barrett.

23:46.300 --> 23:50.847
Come on, Mom.
They need you. I mean,
they're totally pathetic.

23:50.888 --> 23:52.140
Hey.

23:52.181 --> 23:53.766
Dude.

23:53.808 --> 23:55.977
Look, we're not gonna
let you down.

23:57.603 --> 23:59.730
Shit. All right.

24:05.444 --> 24:06.904
Oh, boy.

24:07.989 --> 24:10.324
Are you committed?

24:10.366 --> 24:11.784
Are you sure you have
what it takes?

24:11.826 --> 24:13.035
-Yes!
-Yes!

24:14.245 --> 24:16.038
-You fools ready to go to war?
-Yes!

24:16.080 --> 24:17.999
-Ma'am, yes, ma'am.
-All right.

24:18.040 --> 24:19.542
So you're really gonna help us?

24:19.584 --> 24:21.752
-Yes.

24:21.794 --> 24:23.045
But only out of pity.

24:24.755 --> 24:26.465
Now get out of my house.
Come on.

24:28.342 --> 24:30.303
Wow, the Dean hooked us up.

24:30.344 --> 24:33.055
Okay. All right.

24:38.603 --> 24:41.856
Okay. This um--
It's not that bad.

24:47.445 --> 24:50.823
It's actually better--
better than
I thought it would be.

24:50.865 --> 24:52.950
Smells like somebody
died in here.

24:52.992 --> 24:54.869
And their ghost took a shit.

24:54.911 --> 24:58.372
-I think somebody did
die in here.

24:58.414 --> 25:01.250
We can make this feel
like home in no time.

25:02.418 --> 25:05.838
By participating in
this venerated ceremony,

25:05.880 --> 25:09.592
you'll be linked for eternity
to the many great Betas
who came before you,

25:09.634 --> 25:13.012
dating all the way back to 2015.

25:13.888 --> 25:15.389
Present the recruits.

25:20.645 --> 25:22.396
-Kneel.
-Yeah, kneel.

25:24.941 --> 25:30.363
Do you, Geoff and Jeff--
Wait, they have the same name?

25:30.404 --> 25:31.948
-Geoff.
-Jeff.

25:34.033 --> 25:35.826
Okay, cool.

25:35.868 --> 25:37.912
With this sword,
you will be knighted Betas.

25:37.954 --> 25:39.372
No, no, no, no, it's okay.

25:39.413 --> 25:40.915
It's a ceremony.

25:43.251 --> 25:47.922
Jeff and Geoff,
you are now inducted into
our sacred gaming brotherhood.

25:47.964 --> 25:51.425
Behold!
The newly knighted Betas!

25:55.179 --> 25:56.847
Oh, God.

25:59.684 --> 26:03.145
-Oh, if it isn't the 8-Bits.
-More like the eight bitches.

26:03.187 --> 26:05.273
Easy with that, 'Cardo.
Female traitors, yes.

26:05.314 --> 26:08.901
Oh, sorry, I thought the insult
convention was down the street.

26:08.943 --> 26:11.654
Oh, then take those size 13's
and walk there yourself.

26:13.030 --> 26:16.158
Seriously,
you left the Betas for this?

26:16.200 --> 26:18.160
You couldn't just get in line
like everyone else?

26:18.202 --> 26:19.954
This eSports team
isn't your birthright.

26:19.996 --> 26:22.081
Oh, meet your replacements.

26:22.123 --> 26:23.624
The newly knighted Betas.

26:23.666 --> 26:25.042
How's that make you feel?

26:25.084 --> 26:26.836
If I had a penis, flaccid.

26:26.877 --> 26:29.130
Oh, you wish you had a penis.

26:29.171 --> 26:32.800
-Oh, a strap-on
like yours, babe?
-Oh, I will strap-on right now!

26:32.842 --> 26:34.593
-You can't say that, Ricky.
-It is Ricardo.

26:34.635 --> 26:36.762
-Whatever!
-Thou wanteth a strap?

26:36.804 --> 26:38.139
'Cause I haveth one.

26:38.180 --> 26:40.558
Bringeth!
With extra girtheth!

26:40.599 --> 26:44.312
-Oh, I'm lubing up right now.
-Jump in, baby.

26:44.353 --> 26:47.023
Water's warm
and I'm already wearing
a T-shirt.

26:47.064 --> 26:49.317
Let's spread those cheeks
and see where I fit.

26:49.358 --> 26:52.278
Oh, I'm spread, I'm spread,
I'm like peanut butter
and jelly.

26:52.320 --> 26:54.447
-What is happening?
-This is what's happening.

26:54.488 --> 26:57.825
-Oh, oh!

26:57.867 --> 26:59.577
Oh, my God.

26:59.618 --> 27:02.621
What did you eat?

27:05.666 --> 27:08.669
-What are you, a camel?
-Yeah, that's what I call
a pearl necklace.

27:08.711 --> 27:10.546
It's gonna burn right through
your clothes.

27:10.588 --> 27:12.923
-Ew.
-Hey!

27:12.965 --> 27:16.302
Dick or no dick,
tonight we celebrate
not being dicks.

27:19.138 --> 27:22.224
Celebrate all you want.
'Cause after Monday's match,

27:22.266 --> 27:24.852
the only partying you're gonna
be doing is pity partying.

27:24.894 --> 27:26.395
What are you talking about?

27:26.437 --> 27:27.855
You haven't seen the schedule?

27:28.689 --> 27:30.191
Your first match is against us.

27:31.484 --> 27:34.945
-Ba-ba-ba-bah!
-Yeah, ba-ba-bah!

27:34.987 --> 27:37.531
All right, everyone,
let's break it up.

27:38.282 --> 27:39.742
Yeah, let's break it up.

27:41.702 --> 27:42.995
Back to the house, boys.

27:43.037 --> 27:44.997
All of you are going down.

27:45.039 --> 27:46.832
Looks like she jizzed on you.

27:46.874 --> 27:49.418
Jeff, Geoff.

27:49.460 --> 27:52.505
Diane, I'm seriously gonna have
nightmares about that.

27:54.465 --> 27:57.134
All right, 8-Bits.
It's game day.

27:57.176 --> 27:58.969
Here we are, all together.

27:59.011 --> 28:00.679
All of us.

28:00.721 --> 28:03.140
Anyway, what uh--
What game do you guys play?

28:03.182 --> 28:05.935
Knights of the Elder Orb, duh.

28:05.976 --> 28:08.354
Knights of the Elder Orb, duh.

28:08.396 --> 28:11.190
Cool, I'm really not familiar
with that game.

28:11.232 --> 28:16.028
But I will be. So, what's up,
Galadriel?

28:21.200 --> 28:23.661
And, uh, the--
The-- The voice?

28:23.702 --> 28:27.998
-Comes with the costume.
-Okay, cool. Moving on, uh,

28:28.040 --> 28:31.502
I have no idea what any of
your strengths are,
but play to them.

28:31.544 --> 28:32.711
Play to your strengths.

28:35.256 --> 28:37.258
Great. Great session, guys.

28:38.426 --> 28:39.427
All right.

28:41.011 --> 28:42.680
I feel uninspired.

28:42.721 --> 28:44.890
Chin up,
we're gonna do great.

28:52.982 --> 28:55.317
Oh, hey, watch out for
that turret, it shoots...

28:55.359 --> 28:57.611
-Goddamn it!
-...lasers.

28:59.613 --> 29:02.616
Betas, don't let them take
a single tower.

29:04.285 --> 29:06.954
-Jenna, what are you doing?
-I'm helping you.

29:06.996 --> 29:10.249
-Get back in the jungle.
-I'm quickly popping back
to base.

29:10.291 --> 29:12.626
-Someone cover mid.
-Okey dokey.

29:12.668 --> 29:14.879
-Lilly, look out!

29:14.920 --> 29:18.174
-Oh!
-I'm gonna rip your throat out
next time.

29:18.215 --> 29:19.842
Come on,
look alive out there!

29:19.884 --> 29:21.802
-Kinda impossible.

29:24.763 --> 29:26.932
All right, team,
my ult is ready.
Let's pick one off.

29:30.186 --> 29:32.104
Did you guys see that?

29:32.146 --> 29:33.564
Jenna, pay attention!

29:33.606 --> 29:35.316
Betas, time to blitz!

29:35.357 --> 29:37.067
-I'm with you.
-Got you!

29:37.109 --> 29:38.694
On it, Captain!

29:38.736 --> 29:41.530
No, no, no, no.
Back to base.
Defend our Axis.

29:41.572 --> 29:43.782
-On it.
-How about some defense?

29:45.534 --> 29:48.871
-Yo, I got that orb.
-Where is everyone?

29:48.913 --> 29:51.248
Defend, defend,
defend, all you want, baby.

29:51.290 --> 29:52.458
Going in.

29:53.501 --> 29:54.919
Bam!

29:57.671 --> 30:00.883
-You guys got ganked!
-G-G-G-Ganked.

30:00.925 --> 30:03.093
-"Nationally ranked."
-More like nationally ganked!

30:03.135 --> 30:05.387
-Oh, looks like we're
too spicy for you.

30:05.429 --> 30:08.474
They are horrible.

30:08.516 --> 30:11.644
Wasn't someone on the team
supposed to be guarding the orb?

30:11.685 --> 30:14.897
Go back to playing
Fruity Frog, nerds.

30:16.190 --> 30:19.527
-I hate them.
-I hate them too.

30:19.568 --> 30:23.531
The whiskers aren't just
on my face, ladies.

30:23.572 --> 30:26.116
Subscribe!

30:26.158 --> 30:29.912
Oh-ho, look at that!
I'm a "putty tat"!

30:34.166 --> 30:35.084
V!

30:35.876 --> 30:37.294
-Hey.
-Hey.

30:37.336 --> 30:38.712
I didn't know you worked here.

30:38.754 --> 30:40.714
Oh, welcome to my second home.

30:40.756 --> 30:43.425
So, you get free stuff
or what?

30:43.467 --> 30:46.011
Oh, just nominal discounts
for selling my soul.

30:46.053 --> 30:47.888
Seems to be the new norm
these days.

30:47.930 --> 30:50.599
Did you bring Band-Aids
for my wounds?

30:50.641 --> 30:54.770
Go easy on yourself.
That was your first match.
There's bound to be some kinks.

30:54.812 --> 30:57.231
Is that what you're calling
total annihilation?

30:57.273 --> 30:59.608
My whole collegiate future
is in tatters.

30:59.650 --> 31:02.861
Yeah, but you started
your own team.

31:02.903 --> 31:05.823
You're doing the right thing.
It's pretty awesome.

31:08.033 --> 31:09.994
So did you come here to
buy something or...

31:10.035 --> 31:12.705
No, uh, actually,

31:12.746 --> 31:17.793
I was gonna ask
if maybe you wanted to
hang out this weekend?

31:17.835 --> 31:21.714
Oh, um, I-- I don't--

31:21.755 --> 31:23.841
-I don't really have time.
-Oh, okay.

31:23.882 --> 31:26.427
We could just game, online.

31:26.468 --> 31:28.762
Friday night?
You gotta practice, right?

31:28.804 --> 31:31.640
-Nice counter.
-Thank you.

31:31.682 --> 31:35.477
-I'll see you Friday.
-Okay, cool.

31:35.519 --> 31:38.564
-I'm "0win", by the way.
-Yeah, I-- I know your name.

31:38.606 --> 31:41.066
Oh, no.
No, I mean my-- my handle.

31:41.108 --> 31:42.484
-It's "0win."
-Oh.

31:42.526 --> 31:44.320
But the E is an I,
because "win"

31:44.361 --> 31:46.572
-and the O is a zero,
because the--
-Mm-hmm.

31:46.614 --> 31:50.075
Okay, well,
I'm gonna go, so...

31:50.117 --> 31:52.870
-I'll-- I'll find you on Friday.
-Okay.

31:52.911 --> 31:54.538
-Bye.
-Bye.

31:55.414 --> 31:58.083
Hey Owen,
the exit's that way.

32:01.795 --> 32:03.922
-Bye.
-Bye.

32:06.175 --> 32:07.009
Hmm.

32:08.135 --> 32:09.678
Diane, get off my ass!

32:09.720 --> 32:11.680
I'm not on your ass,
I'm under your ass.

32:11.722 --> 32:14.099
-I'm gonna
freaking kill you.

32:14.141 --> 32:16.310
-Not if I kill you first.
-Circle up,
team meeting.

32:16.352 --> 32:17.728
We've got to chat.

32:21.482 --> 32:23.233
All right,
I'm gonna cut to the chase.

32:23.275 --> 32:25.527
That match was horrendous.

32:25.569 --> 32:27.237
With zero hyperbole,

32:27.279 --> 32:29.156
it was a hate crime against
people with eyes.

32:29.198 --> 32:33.035
We need to get back
to the basics.
Get to know each other.

32:33.077 --> 32:35.913
I wanna know,
what are your favorite games?

32:35.954 --> 32:40.042
We'll play them together
and then we can incorporate
those skills into this team.

32:41.293 --> 32:42.503
I'm gonna go first.

32:45.089 --> 32:48.717
All right, well, I'm Parker.

32:48.759 --> 32:52.721
I am a former
video game designer
turned teacher.

32:52.763 --> 32:54.765
I'm a lapsed feminist

32:54.807 --> 32:57.184
and I like to stay close
to gaming

32:57.226 --> 33:00.854
even though,
it really hurts me. Mmm.

33:02.481 --> 33:03.607
Who's next?

33:09.446 --> 33:12.074
Hi, I-- I'm Sloane.

33:12.116 --> 33:13.409
And I'm a gamer.

33:13.450 --> 33:15.869
Hi, Sloane.

33:15.911 --> 33:18.580
Gaming is my escape.

33:18.622 --> 33:21.625
It's where I go
when I wanna feel
like a superhero, you know.

33:21.667 --> 33:23.293
Yeah, that's great.
That's really good.

33:25.129 --> 33:29.049
I didn't even touch a controller
before my accident.

33:29.091 --> 33:32.344
But I met
an awesome community online

33:32.386 --> 33:37.307
and, um, they helped me start
a Patreon, so I could get
my life back to normal.

33:37.349 --> 33:40.394
Well, as normal as I could.

33:40.436 --> 33:45.149
Starting with off-campus
housing and, uh, hand controls,
so I can drive again.

33:45.190 --> 33:46.900
Went alone for spring break,
bitches.

33:50.904 --> 33:53.323
-Yeah, yeah.

33:53.365 --> 33:56.076
I used to play my Game Boy
all day

33:56.118 --> 34:00.247
when my dad and I
would ride dolphins
from Miami to Cuba.

34:00.289 --> 34:05.043
Yeah. And then I found out
two months ago,
that wasn't really my dad.

34:09.047 --> 34:11.425
One time, I took too much
ecstasy at an all-night rave

34:11.467 --> 34:13.552
and woke up tied to an RV
dressed like a fairy.

34:13.594 --> 34:15.763
I had so much glitter
in my vagina, when I queefed,

34:15.804 --> 34:18.098
-it was like
a Kesha concert down there.

34:18.140 --> 34:20.684
-Yeah, that happened.
-It was so awesome.

34:20.726 --> 34:23.312
-Okay. Thanks, Diane.
-That's nice. Fun stuff.

34:23.353 --> 34:25.856
Glad I went first. Wow.

34:27.357 --> 34:29.109
Okay, let's train.

34:29.902 --> 34:31.069
Cue music.

34:33.113 --> 34:36.575
We're going to train mentally,
spiritually, physically.

34:36.617 --> 34:39.870
We're gonna sharpen
those reflexes. Work on our
communication with one another.

34:39.912 --> 34:42.998
-Come on, I need some help.
-Boost our confidence.

34:43.040 --> 34:46.293
And most importantly,
the trust that you have in
one another.

34:46.335 --> 34:49.129
-Because as things
currently stand...

34:50.923 --> 34:53.842
-you have a zero-percent
chance of winning.
-Great pep talk.

34:55.928 --> 34:58.138
It's time to show me
your killer instincts.

34:58.180 --> 35:00.516
Because I want to get them
out of your heads

35:00.557 --> 35:02.810
and get you into theirs.

35:02.851 --> 35:04.645
-Dick-mopper.
-Bastard.

35:04.686 --> 35:06.897
Suck tank, you filthy cuck!

35:06.939 --> 35:08.857
Now, remember to keep it simple.

35:08.899 --> 35:11.819
The number-one objective
is to destroy the enemy's orb.

35:14.988 --> 35:17.658
-Dang it.
-Nice backhand!

35:17.699 --> 35:20.077
-Get ya on the next one, though.
-Lilly, who are you talking to?

35:22.287 --> 35:26.291
Go, Tommy! Go, Timmy!
Go, Tommy! Go, Timmy!

35:26.333 --> 35:29.503
I'm gonna disembowel you
and jump rope
with your large intestine.

35:29.545 --> 35:31.463
And once I've led the cops
away from your scent,

35:31.505 --> 35:33.257
I will feed your guts to
my pet unicorn

35:33.298 --> 35:35.133
while crafting a necklace
out of your teeth!

35:35.175 --> 35:36.593
♪ What we're up against, what ♪

35:36.635 --> 35:38.846
♪ This is, this is what... ♪

35:38.887 --> 35:40.889
Is he wearing Axe body spray?

35:40.931 --> 35:44.184
Oh, yeah, I wanted to be
as authentic as possible.

36:07.499 --> 36:09.251
-Wow.

36:13.088 --> 36:15.299
Oh, oh, I have a game.

36:15.340 --> 36:17.509
We just, uh, can't play it
in here.

36:21.930 --> 36:24.933
-You do this every Saturday?
-Every other.

36:24.975 --> 36:26.393
For Frodo!

36:36.194 --> 36:38.739
Yeah, I'm done. I'm done.

36:38.780 --> 36:39.990
-Yes!
-Yes!

36:51.460 --> 36:53.921
-Oh, oh, no, no, no,

36:53.962 --> 36:55.380
♪ I'm that good ♪

36:57.382 --> 36:59.176
♪ I'm that good ♪

36:59.217 --> 37:02.095
That was great, guys, well done.
Fantastic.

37:02.137 --> 37:04.014
Yeah, uh,
can we do this every class?

37:04.056 --> 37:06.099
-Uh, I'm gonna have to
talk to legal about that.
-Okay.

37:09.561 --> 37:11.229
Oh, not so fast.

37:11.271 --> 37:13.357
-What's this?
-It's your homework.

37:13.398 --> 37:15.150
-Oh, God, Battletoads?

37:15.192 --> 37:17.819
Wait, that was my favorite game
when I was a kid.

37:17.861 --> 37:19.947
It's also one of the hardest
titles ever made.

37:19.988 --> 37:23.241
To beat it,
you have to let opportunities
present themselves to you,

37:23.283 --> 37:25.619
instead of just
diving in headfirst.

37:25.661 --> 37:27.788
Patience isn't exactly
your strong suit, V.

37:27.829 --> 37:31.875
If you can learn
how to take a breath,
assess all of your options,

37:31.917 --> 37:33.293
you could become
a better player.

37:34.252 --> 37:35.712
And a better teammate.

37:35.754 --> 37:36.755
Hmm.

37:38.090 --> 37:39.132
Cool.

37:43.387 --> 37:45.931
All right, we got 'em. Let's go.

37:45.973 --> 37:50.102
What?

37:50.143 --> 37:53.063
Ooh, these dudes can't take me
tonight, girl.

37:53.105 --> 37:55.565
Go, go, go!

37:55.607 --> 37:58.026
-They're coming from the left.
-Yeah, yeah, yeah. Get 'em.

37:59.444 --> 38:01.154
Yes, queen!

38:01.196 --> 38:03.490
-Nice.
-Whoo.

38:03.532 --> 38:04.992
Good job, babe.

38:05.033 --> 38:07.202
Oh, shoot.
Um, it's Owen.

38:07.244 --> 38:11.331
-Um, for our gaming date.
-Cavorting with the enemy,
really?

38:11.373 --> 38:13.333
No, no, no,
he's harmless.

38:13.375 --> 38:15.043
-Is this a male?
-Yes.

38:15.085 --> 38:17.754
Oh, my God, he is cute.

38:17.796 --> 38:19.172
You are talking to this boy?

38:20.549 --> 38:22.217
V, this is progress!

38:22.259 --> 38:24.177
Con-vagulations.

38:24.219 --> 38:26.763
-Ew, Indy, stop.

38:26.805 --> 38:29.641
Okay, I'll give you some
privacy so you can slip
into your vajamas.

38:29.683 --> 38:31.560
-Oh my God.
-I'm out.

38:31.601 --> 38:33.895
Go earn that
red vag of courage, girl.

38:33.937 --> 38:37.399
I know you got it... in you.

38:37.441 --> 38:40.360
-In you? Hmm.
-Okay.

38:40.402 --> 38:41.737
-I get it, thank you.
-Is that-- Hmm.

38:41.778 --> 38:43.280
Nope, you're-- you're good.

38:43.321 --> 38:45.157
You can go now.

38:45.198 --> 38:47.034
-Oh, my God,
get away from me. Go!
-Okay, okay.

38:47.075 --> 38:48.869
-Should I make my vag-exit?
-Get out!

38:48.910 --> 38:50.787
God, you both are horrible.

38:50.829 --> 38:53.707
Okay, no one is going
near my vagi-- Oh!

38:53.749 --> 38:55.709
-Whoa. Hi.
-Hey, Owen.

38:55.751 --> 38:57.544
-Hi.
-What's up?

38:57.586 --> 38:59.254
-Do you need a moment or...?
-No. No, I'm good.

38:59.296 --> 39:01.506
Indigo, get out! Get out.

39:01.548 --> 39:04.342
Um, should we start gaming?

39:04.384 --> 39:06.470
Uh, sure.

39:06.511 --> 39:08.430
Yeah, not-- not judging.

39:09.723 --> 39:10.724
After you.

39:11.767 --> 39:13.018
Ooh, quite
the gentlemen.

39:13.060 --> 39:14.311
Milady.

39:16.646 --> 39:20.942
-All right, let's do this.
-Okay, I got the guy
on the left. I got him.

39:20.984 --> 39:23.612
-See that guy?
-Yeah, yeah.
I got it, I got it.

39:23.653 --> 39:25.155
Night-night.

39:25.197 --> 39:27.449
-Leave some for me.
-Only if you can keep up.

39:28.825 --> 39:31.078
Oh, that kid was trash.

39:32.162 --> 39:33.872
-That's yours?
-Yep, I got it.

39:33.914 --> 39:35.832
Ooh, hoo, hoo, hoo!

39:35.874 --> 39:39.294
I'm gonna hide over here
and then you can jump out.

39:39.336 --> 39:40.670
-Now, now, now. Go, go, go.
-Okay, I got it.

39:40.712 --> 39:42.089
-Yeah, send it.
-All right.

39:42.130 --> 39:44.424
-Boom. There we go.

39:44.466 --> 39:47.094
-That guy got smoked.
-All right, that's you,
that's you.

39:48.512 --> 39:49.763
Well, look at that.

39:49.805 --> 39:51.681
You get a nap and you get a nap.

39:51.723 --> 39:53.225
Yeah, that's yours.
He's trash. He's trash.

39:54.392 --> 39:56.019
-Get it.
-Get it.

39:56.061 --> 39:57.604
-Get it.
-Get it.

39:57.646 --> 39:59.856
-Get it!

39:59.898 --> 40:01.108
Let's go! Come on.

40:02.526 --> 40:04.569
-Yes!
-Whoo!

40:04.611 --> 40:07.489
You know, you're not bad
at this game, Owen.

40:07.531 --> 40:10.200
-There's a reason why
I'm ranked higher than you.
-Whatever.

40:10.242 --> 40:12.119
Ooh, ooh, ooh, mine!

40:12.160 --> 40:14.121
No. Mine!

40:15.622 --> 40:17.207
Too slow, buddy.

40:18.917 --> 40:20.752
I like the way you slay.

40:20.794 --> 40:23.421
You're not so bad yourself.

40:23.463 --> 40:27.259
-It's, uh-- It's been nice
to just play, you know?
-Yeah.

40:27.300 --> 40:31.138
Feel like lately
I'm forced to game
like my life depends on it.

40:32.055 --> 40:34.141
And I guess it kind of does.

40:34.182 --> 40:37.769
For the record,
I love the damage we do
as teammates.

40:37.811 --> 40:39.688
Oh, what could have been.

40:41.648 --> 40:43.733
We spent a lot of time
together at practice,

40:43.775 --> 40:50.282
but we never actually spent
time together, you know?

40:50.991 --> 40:52.534
I do know.

40:52.576 --> 40:54.035
I totally know, yeah.

40:55.328 --> 40:57.038
We should do it more.

40:57.956 --> 41:00.041
But, like, in person.

41:00.083 --> 41:02.878
Totally, I--
I'd like that.

41:02.919 --> 41:05.213
That-- That'd be nice.

41:06.131 --> 41:07.924
And thank you.

41:07.966 --> 41:09.509
For what?

41:10.594 --> 41:13.138
For not being
one of the bad guys.

41:17.809 --> 41:20.312
So, uh, I'm gonna go.

41:20.353 --> 41:21.813
Right, yeah.

41:21.855 --> 41:23.982
Uh, okay.

41:24.024 --> 41:26.776
Well, it was, uh,
good to see you.

41:27.819 --> 41:29.654
-Bye, Owen.
-All right. Bye.

41:29.696 --> 41:31.990
♪ I've got a crush on you ♪

41:32.032 --> 41:35.702
♪ I feel like a child
Oh, I can't help but smile ♪

41:35.744 --> 41:39.456
♪ When you walk in the room ♪

41:39.497 --> 41:42.500
♪ I've got a crush on you ♪

41:42.542 --> 41:44.377
♪ I've got a crush on you ♪

41:46.546 --> 41:48.632
Okay, purple's my power color.
Give it up.

41:48.673 --> 41:52.010
-Yes, it is.
-I love my patrons
and their money.

41:52.052 --> 41:53.261
Thank you, Jenna.

41:53.303 --> 41:54.804
All righty, all right.

41:54.846 --> 41:57.140
Settle down.

41:57.182 --> 41:59.976
All right, today,
we're switching things up.

42:00.018 --> 42:02.604
After seeing you in action
and learning your strengths,
I've got a plan.

42:02.646 --> 42:03.939
Sloane,

42:05.732 --> 42:07.067
you're our new support.

42:07.108 --> 42:10.111
You need to protect our carry.
You're here to serve.

42:10.153 --> 42:11.738
-Like bottoming?
-Yes.

42:14.658 --> 42:17.994
Jenna, you're our carry.
High damage, low defense.

42:18.036 --> 42:20.163
Dish pain from a distance,
but never get caught alone.

42:20.205 --> 42:21.873
We need you for every single
team fight.

42:21.915 --> 42:25.001
-Sweet abs.
-I'd do him.

42:25.043 --> 42:29.673
All right, focus.
Lilly, meet Kallari.
You're jungling.

42:29.714 --> 42:32.384
You're our ninja assassin.
Means you have to murder
from behind.

42:32.425 --> 42:34.678
Yes, I get to gank.

42:34.719 --> 42:37.222
Diane, you command the off lane.

42:37.264 --> 42:39.099
Your mission:
absorb their front line.

42:39.140 --> 42:41.726
-All right.
-Do not lose a tower

42:41.768 --> 42:43.478
and be ready
for those team fights.

42:43.520 --> 42:45.522
Rum-pum-pum, pum-pum, pum.

42:45.563 --> 42:48.400
And V, cast from the middle.

42:48.441 --> 42:52.070
-Guard the Axis,
you're our quarterback.
-These are all new roles.

42:52.112 --> 42:56.116
Is this really the time
to experiment with
our champions and positions?

42:56.157 --> 43:00.745
If you wanna win,
you have to adapt.
What's it gonna be?

43:20.390 --> 43:23.435
Oh, he's on my ass.
He's freaking eating
my ass right now.

43:23.476 --> 43:27.230
God. Lilly,
he is mining my Moria.

43:27.272 --> 43:28.898
-Okay, you're on me.
-All ready.

43:28.940 --> 43:32.694
Three, two, one, yes!

43:32.736 --> 43:34.904
Taste the rainbow, bitch!
-Yeah, that was so good.

43:34.946 --> 43:36.906
-That was awesome.
-Yes.

43:41.745 --> 43:45.790
-Dude, we can't give these
chicks the satisfaction.
-We're not going to.

43:45.832 --> 43:51.963
-Keep up the tempo,
you've got 'em.
-Losing con-- I c-can't...

43:52.005 --> 43:54.174
-Did they just pull
their own plug?
-We lost power.

43:54.215 --> 43:55.508
Hey, a win's a win.

44:20.367 --> 44:22.660
All right, guys, let's go.

44:22.702 --> 44:26.081
One, two, three.

44:26.122 --> 44:27.123
Hand jobs.

44:28.958 --> 44:31.836
-Forget about 'em. Let's go.
-I just-- I kill myself.

44:31.878 --> 44:34.756
-You nailed it!
-What are they
doing here?

44:36.633 --> 44:40.303
Come on, that's it.
High energy.

44:40.345 --> 44:42.555
Let's get those builds
going, guys.

44:42.597 --> 44:44.182
Guys, less floating around.

44:44.224 --> 44:45.809
Defense.

44:45.850 --> 44:47.560
-Going mid.
-I'll go left.

44:47.602 --> 44:50.146
-I got my full build. Let's go.
-Commit. Commit.

44:55.402 --> 44:57.445
All right, let's keep it
together, guys. Come on.

44:58.613 --> 45:00.156
They're all over me
right now, guys.

45:01.282 --> 45:03.785
Somebody please come
to the middle right now.

45:03.827 --> 45:05.537
V, V, I don't see you.

45:05.578 --> 45:08.665
-No!
-Whoo, yes!

45:11.459 --> 45:13.878
-So sad.
-Lilly, we need wards to see
where they are.

45:13.920 --> 45:15.880
Okay, I'm on it.

45:19.801 --> 45:24.639
Surprise. I'm going to chop
your head off and I'm gonna eat
your arm for breakfast.

45:24.681 --> 45:26.266
It's gonna be so delicious.

45:26.307 --> 45:29.853
-Oh, my God!

45:29.894 --> 45:31.980
All right, all right,
all right. Get it.

45:32.021 --> 45:33.565
Don't let them take our tower.

45:33.606 --> 45:34.732
Let's go, let's go.

45:36.192 --> 45:38.862
Dang it.

45:38.903 --> 45:40.530
They've cleared out
our jungle of minions.

45:40.572 --> 45:42.407
Hey, where's our defense?

45:43.491 --> 45:45.285
Guess it's time for offense.

45:46.536 --> 45:48.496
V, don't drift to the top.

45:48.538 --> 45:50.331
You're in my lane, V.

45:50.373 --> 45:53.251
V, the game plan.
Don't force it.

45:53.293 --> 45:55.128
V, we need you
back in the middle.

45:55.170 --> 45:57.380
Trust me, I've got eyes
on the orb.

45:59.007 --> 46:00.842
Seriously,
we need you over here.

46:00.884 --> 46:02.594
Relax, I've got this.

46:06.014 --> 46:08.475
-Shit.

46:08.516 --> 46:10.768
-Yeah, that's right.
-Guys,
they're all over us.

46:10.810 --> 46:12.437
They're gonna take the orb.

46:12.479 --> 46:14.772
-Come on, we got this.
-No, no, no.

46:21.154 --> 46:22.780
-God. So close.
-So close.

46:22.822 --> 46:25.408
-Gonna cry.

46:25.450 --> 46:27.619
"8-Bits"? 0-Bits.

46:30.955 --> 46:34.667
Well, how am I supposed to be
dealing damage when absolutely
nobody is covering me?

46:34.709 --> 46:36.586
Well, I don't know.
Jenna was there.

46:36.628 --> 46:38.922
-Yeah, Jenna was asleep
at the wheel.
-Hey!

46:38.963 --> 46:42.509
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
easy, tiger.
This was not bad at all.

46:42.550 --> 46:45.637
-There were some solid combos.
-Combos? Who cares?

46:45.678 --> 46:47.639
We just got snowballed
by those ass-goblins.

46:47.680 --> 46:51.434
Yeah, no shit, maybe stop
playing for yourself, Dustin.

46:53.144 --> 46:55.313
All right, all right, everyone,
just get dressed, okay.

46:55.355 --> 46:59.484
We can talk about this outside.
V, a word?

47:01.027 --> 47:03.821
-Yeah.
-You care to tell me what
the hell you're doing out there?

47:03.863 --> 47:06.324
-I was trying to win the game.
-Not for us, you weren't.

47:06.366 --> 47:10.119
Look, the game plan that I put
into place did not call
for you playing hero.

47:10.161 --> 47:12.872
Your impatience
let the whole team down.

47:12.914 --> 47:14.457
Are we done?

47:14.499 --> 47:17.460
We will be,
you wanna keep going rogue.

47:21.881 --> 47:23.925
Hi. How's it going?

47:24.759 --> 47:26.719
-Good.
-Walk with me.

47:27.679 --> 47:30.515
Uh, you're not recording me,
are you?

47:30.557 --> 47:33.393
-What, no.
-Okay, good, good.

47:33.434 --> 47:40.024
Yeah, so, uh, been informed that
your little team's making some
waves around here on campus.

47:40.066 --> 47:43.069
Also been informed that
what I told you before,

47:43.111 --> 47:46.656
I was not allowed
to tell you.

47:46.698 --> 47:50.076
I got sat down
with the athletic director
and a board of trustees

47:50.118 --> 47:52.328
and we went over the situation
here at Barrett

47:52.370 --> 47:54.497
and I've come to the conclusion
they don't know what the hell

47:54.539 --> 47:56.624
they're talking about.

47:56.666 --> 47:59.168
But I've been forced
to make some changes,

47:59.210 --> 48:04.048
and come next year,
Barrett will be only funding
one eSports team,

48:04.090 --> 48:06.634
which means it's either
you or the Betas,

48:06.676 --> 48:08.011
which probably means
it's the Betas, right?

48:08.052 --> 48:10.096
What about my scholarship?

48:10.138 --> 48:12.765
Yeah, uh, well, unless you win,

48:12.807 --> 48:16.352
I would be forced
to cancel that,
which makes me sad.

48:16.394 --> 48:18.771
But doesn't rock the boat
which makes me happy.

48:18.813 --> 48:20.815
Wait, if we win on Tuesday,

48:20.857 --> 48:23.318
then we'll make it
to the national championships.

48:23.359 --> 48:24.902
Get real, I did my research.

48:24.944 --> 48:26.946
You're playing
the Kansas City Kong,

48:26.988 --> 48:29.282
the second-ranked eSports team
in the nation.

48:31.409 --> 48:33.453
Good luck. Toodle-oo.

48:33.494 --> 48:34.996
Girl power, everybody.

48:35.038 --> 48:36.706
Let's go!

48:37.290 --> 48:38.875
Girl power!

48:40.668 --> 48:43.755
So, you're saying we have to
beat the Kong,

48:43.796 --> 48:45.506
or we're kicked out
of Barrett forever.

48:45.548 --> 48:47.842
My life as I know it is toast.

48:47.884 --> 48:50.637
Wait, the Dean can't just
cancel us like that, right?

48:50.678 --> 48:52.305
Why not?
He's totally out to get me.

48:52.347 --> 48:56.684
-Us. Out to get us.
-Whatever, sure, Sloane.

48:56.726 --> 48:59.228
Okay, look,
we need to double up
on practices, all right?

48:59.270 --> 49:00.938
I can't. I have work study.

49:00.980 --> 49:03.608
Yeah, I'm maxed too, V.

49:03.650 --> 49:06.986
If I don't log those 30
streaming hours a week,
I lose my sponsors

49:07.028 --> 49:09.447
and news flash, I like money.

49:09.489 --> 49:12.909
-Yeah, V, I barely have time
to take a dump.
-Oh, my God.

49:12.950 --> 49:15.411
Did you guys know
sea otters hold hands
while they're sleeping

49:15.453 --> 49:17.580
to prevent themselves
from drifting apart.

49:17.622 --> 49:19.248
-Aw...
-Oh. Really?

49:19.290 --> 49:20.458
-Yeah.
-That's so cute.

49:20.500 --> 49:22.126
What planet are you all on?

49:22.168 --> 49:23.920
Jesus Christ, V!
It's not just about you.

49:23.961 --> 49:26.714
-Never said it was.
-You literally just said that.

49:26.756 --> 49:30.385
Look around, V,
this is your clan!

49:30.426 --> 49:33.012
This is what we always wanted,
a team.

49:33.054 --> 49:35.640
Yeah. I understand that.
But it all goes away,

49:35.682 --> 49:38.434
if I don't go
to the championship. Okay?

49:38.476 --> 49:41.521
I have everything riding
on this scholarship.
You don't understand--

49:41.562 --> 49:45.066
I don't understand?
My scholarship
is on the line too,

49:45.108 --> 49:49.445
and yet somehow you're
the one complaining about
how unfair the world is to you.

49:49.487 --> 49:53.783
Are you guys about to fight?
Because if so, I would love
to livestream this.

49:53.825 --> 49:57.370
-So, if you guys could start
that dialogue over--
-Cut the cameras, Professor X.

49:57.412 --> 50:00.039
-Okay, say that again, giant!
-Fee-fi-fo-fum!

50:00.081 --> 50:02.875
-You and your stupid
influencing.
-Hey, hey, stop fighting, guys!

50:02.917 --> 50:05.628
Hey, no one cares
about your followers, Jenna!

50:07.880 --> 50:09.799
Enough! Stop!

50:09.841 --> 50:11.509
This is not okay!

50:15.680 --> 50:16.806
Wow.

50:20.351 --> 50:23.771
Just-- Everyone,
take a deep breath.

50:26.023 --> 50:27.900
You're all taking this team
for granted.

50:29.193 --> 50:31.112
We need to start
from the beginning, young Jedi.

50:33.740 --> 50:35.992
Sorry, technically,
we'd be called "Padawans".

50:37.326 --> 50:38.619
Padawans it is.

50:39.996 --> 50:41.831
Whoa, she has a garage here?

50:41.873 --> 50:44.625
All right, I don't come
back here anymore.

50:44.667 --> 50:47.420
But I think it's time to share
with you guys.

50:57.972 --> 51:01.434
-Oh, my God.

51:05.855 --> 51:08.399
Parker, you've been totally
holding out on us.

51:08.441 --> 51:10.067
I think I just lost my mind.

51:10.109 --> 51:12.528
I think I just creamed my cords.

51:12.570 --> 51:15.865
Look at all these ancient games,
guys. It's like a museum.

51:18.117 --> 51:19.702
-Let's, uh--

51:19.744 --> 51:22.205
Let's play it
and not impregnate it.

51:22.955 --> 51:25.666
Turtles. And ninjas.

51:25.708 --> 51:29.295
Ninja Turtles is literally
the Reese's Peanut Butter Cup
of heroes.

51:29.337 --> 51:32.298
Only the best coin-operated
team game of all time.

51:34.967 --> 51:37.804
Contra.

51:37.845 --> 51:40.556
My dad used to play this
with me all the time.
It was his favorite.

51:40.598 --> 51:43.059
Oh, it's a classic, too. Wait...

51:43.100 --> 51:49.106
Up, up, down, down,
left, right, left, right,
B, A, start.

51:49.899 --> 51:52.527
Everyone, listen up.

51:52.568 --> 51:56.948
It is time to reignite
the fire inside of you
like you're a kid again.

51:56.989 --> 51:58.658
Or a Padawan.

51:58.699 --> 52:00.952
Play till your fingers bleed.

52:02.161 --> 52:03.913
Awesome.

52:04.622 --> 52:06.999
Whoo! Yeah!

52:10.545 --> 52:12.004
Go, Sloane. Yes! Yeah!

52:15.424 --> 52:18.261
Yeah! Whoo!

52:20.263 --> 52:22.557
-Hit that.
-Chug the mug!

52:22.598 --> 52:24.475
-Oh, God!

52:24.517 --> 52:26.644
Chug, chug, chug.

52:28.896 --> 52:31.774
Yeah! Yeah! Go, Sloane!

52:31.816 --> 52:32.692
Whoo!

52:38.030 --> 52:40.491
-I am a rock god!

52:42.743 --> 52:45.162
We killed that one, yeah.

52:45.204 --> 52:46.956
Okay, okay, okay.

52:46.998 --> 52:48.124
GoldenEye.

52:48.165 --> 52:50.293
"License to Kill" scenario.

52:51.627 --> 52:53.629
Ho. Halt, knave!

52:53.671 --> 52:55.506
How dare you blow
on the cartridge!

52:55.548 --> 52:57.466
Moisture in your breath
will rust the game.

52:57.508 --> 52:59.010
Oh, please!

52:59.051 --> 53:02.972
How about slappers-only mode,
no guns,

53:03.014 --> 53:06.017
just good old-fashioned
slapping the shit out
of each other.

53:07.059 --> 53:08.895
-Put it in.
-Ooh, okay.

53:08.936 --> 53:11.981
-Dibs on Oddjob.
-Dibs on Boris.

53:12.023 --> 53:13.524
-Who wants to play?
-I do.

53:13.566 --> 53:15.693
You Soviets are going down.

53:19.906 --> 53:22.450
I wouldn't get too close
if I were you.

53:22.491 --> 53:25.119
I've got a couple
of colorful ghosts to avoid--

53:25.161 --> 53:28.164
in this game
and, metaphorically,
from my past.

53:28.205 --> 53:30.833
Hmm, wow. That's deep.

53:30.875 --> 53:33.294
Oh, yeah,
I'm a little buzzed.

53:33.336 --> 53:38.257
Well, so, when you were
googling me,

53:38.299 --> 53:42.303
did you happen to read that
I dropped out of Barrett
after I sold my first game?

53:42.345 --> 53:45.348
-Wow.
-And look at me now.

53:45.389 --> 53:47.183
I am almost 40,
and I'm still trying

53:47.224 --> 53:51.270
to figure out how Pac-Man
and Ms. Pac-Man bone.

53:51.312 --> 53:54.690
'Cause there's a Pac-Man Jr.
so it has to have happened.

53:54.732 --> 53:59.695
So, you, didn't share in
that first day of practice?

53:59.737 --> 54:01.113
I remember.

54:02.281 --> 54:04.992
What made you fall in love
with gaming?

54:05.034 --> 54:09.246
Well, I wasn't allowed to game,
growing up.

54:09.288 --> 54:11.832
Took a while
to break my parents.

54:11.874 --> 54:14.877
They still don't tolerate
my obsession.

54:14.919 --> 54:20.508
Um, my dad calls me a loser,
who's going nowhere in life.

54:23.052 --> 54:26.555
Yeah, so if I don't win,
I'm gonna have to go home

54:26.597 --> 54:29.684
and apologize for following
my dreams.

54:34.146 --> 54:36.857
We have to win on Tuesday,
Parker.

54:37.900 --> 54:40.319
-Lilly...

54:40.361 --> 54:42.488
-Hey, we said no guns.
-Uh, just a...

54:43.906 --> 54:46.826
Guys, guys, guys, guys, guys.
Who's seen The Wizard?

54:47.785 --> 54:49.412
Like Wizard of Oz?

54:49.453 --> 54:52.707
-Fred Savage.
-Who?

54:52.748 --> 54:56.627
Video Armageddon!

54:56.669 --> 55:00.006
-Guys, it's a classic. Really?
-Ugh.

55:00.047 --> 55:02.133
All right, well,
let's watch it.

55:02.174 --> 55:03.843
-Yeah, okay.
Turn it on.
-Yes?

55:03.884 --> 55:05.928
-Sure.
-Come on, sourpuss.

55:05.970 --> 55:07.054
Let's cheer you up.

55:10.558 --> 55:12.852
-Let's see him beat that.
-Okay, I like this movie.

55:12.893 --> 55:16.105
-Told you.
-Um, I thought
it was gonna be cringe,

55:16.147 --> 55:18.482
but it's actually pretty dope.

55:18.524 --> 55:21.861
Can't believe they made a movie
about people who play
video games.

55:23.237 --> 55:24.655
This movie's so wizard.

55:30.453 --> 55:33.080
What is he? Some kind
of freak or something?

55:33.122 --> 55:35.332
That's it.

55:35.374 --> 55:39.295
-Hey! You conned me.
-I didn't.
I won the bet.

55:39.336 --> 55:42.506
Uh, guys, I'll be right back.
You do not want to miss
this part.

55:47.803 --> 55:50.806
-I think this is the part
where Fred gets savage.
-Mmm.

55:52.683 --> 55:54.685
V, wait, where are you going?

55:54.727 --> 55:56.937
V!

55:56.979 --> 55:59.523
What are we even doing?
We're wasting time.

55:59.565 --> 56:02.401
-We're bonding,
we're letting loose.
-I wanna go pro.

56:02.443 --> 56:05.112
I don't have anything else
and you guys are in there

56:05.154 --> 56:07.114
dry-humping
old pinball machines.

56:08.365 --> 56:12.078
When I fell off Rainbow Road,
you know what I said?

56:12.119 --> 56:14.955
I said, "Lakitu, I don't even
need another life."

56:14.997 --> 56:17.208
I let that red shell just
knock me right off my track.

56:17.249 --> 56:22.213
Lakitu, red shells?
You're drunk!
What's your point?

56:22.254 --> 56:27.760
Look, I--
What I'm trying to say is
just don't do what I did, V.

56:27.802 --> 56:30.221
Don't assume you can do this
all on your own.

56:30.262 --> 56:33.057
You've got a team
and they love you.

56:33.099 --> 56:35.518
And if you're pushing away
the people that love you,

56:35.559 --> 56:37.686
then what happens if you,
with gaming--

56:37.728 --> 56:39.563
You can't even enjoy it
with anybody.

56:40.523 --> 56:41.774
You will regret it.

56:42.525 --> 56:43.943
I know I did.

56:46.904 --> 56:48.364

Here we go.
-8-Bits on three.

58:57.159 --> 58:59.036
Ooh, Kong!

58:59.078 --> 59:00.996
One, two, three.

59:03.666 --> 59:05.459
-Let's go.

59:09.296 --> 59:12.508
Come on, Kong.
Lose this, and we go
back to Kansas City.

59:12.549 --> 59:15.761
-Nobody wants to go there.
-Hey, is she okay?

59:16.804 --> 59:18.305
She doesn't look okay to me.

59:20.099 --> 59:21.517

I got it.

59:28.148 --> 59:29.650
All right, come on, guys.
We got this.

59:29.692 --> 59:31.443
Keep those health bars up.

59:31.485 --> 59:33.654
Let's go!
Eyes on the prize, guys.

59:33.696 --> 59:35.281
There you go Sloane,
keep up the pressure.

59:37.825 --> 59:39.285
Psst! Hey.

59:42.955 --> 59:44.957
Enjoy my back-alley
lobotomy, bitch.

59:47.418 --> 59:49.128
-Sweet combo.
-Milady.

59:49.169 --> 59:50.754
No mercy for the weak, Diane.

59:50.796 --> 59:53.048
-Easy, Cobra Kai!
-Back off, pencil dick.

59:55.092 --> 59:56.135
Crap, I'm low.

59:57.261 --> 59:58.679
Got you covered, Diane.

59:59.471 --> 1:00:01.181
Okay, focus, everyone.

1:00:03.934 --> 1:00:06.603
What the hell?
V, stay in your lane.

1:00:07.646 --> 1:00:09.231
Whatever you say, Sloane.

1:00:15.738 --> 1:00:19.950
-Oh, my God!
-Damn it, V,
that guy came from your lane.

1:00:19.992 --> 1:00:21.785
Use your ultimate.
Now, it's up!

1:00:24.079 --> 1:00:26.915
An ally has been slain.

1:00:30.919 --> 1:00:32.212
V, defend the tower.

1:00:33.630 --> 1:00:36.133
V, get over here.
We need you.

1:00:36.175 --> 1:00:37.634
Get off my back.

1:00:37.676 --> 1:00:39.803
Stop farming minions
and help.

1:00:39.845 --> 1:00:41.597
V, help your team out.

1:00:41.638 --> 1:00:43.015
V, come on.

1:00:50.773 --> 1:00:53.776
-Focus
the healer. Take the shot.
-On it.

1:00:56.320 --> 1:00:57.988
Follow me, boys.

1:00:58.030 --> 1:01:00.449
This healer
thinks she can outrun us.

1:01:02.076 --> 1:01:03.786
Coming, just keep coming.

1:01:03.827 --> 1:01:05.621
Come meet my friend.

1:01:06.372 --> 1:01:07.498
Wait, what are you doing?

1:01:09.583 --> 1:01:10.793
Sloane?

1:01:12.044 --> 1:01:13.837
An enemy has been slain.

1:01:13.879 --> 1:01:15.756
Come on, finish the job.

1:01:15.798 --> 1:01:17.883
-Kill her.
-Nice kill.

1:01:17.925 --> 1:01:19.802
An enemy has been slain.

1:01:19.843 --> 1:01:21.804
Someone had to bring
the game to you.

1:01:21.845 --> 1:01:23.597
Avenge me.

1:01:25.516 --> 1:01:27.893
-Get him, V.
-He's the only one left.

1:01:27.935 --> 1:01:30.979
Guys,
she's right there. Kill her!

1:01:31.021 --> 1:01:33.315
Come on, V.

1:01:33.357 --> 1:01:34.691
Come on, Kong.
Got 'em on the ropes.

1:01:34.733 --> 1:01:36.902
I think V's gonna make it.

1:01:38.320 --> 1:01:40.364
-V, come on.
-You can do it, V.

1:01:40.406 --> 1:01:42.241
No, no, no, no!

1:01:42.282 --> 1:01:44.076
An enemy has been slain.

1:01:44.118 --> 1:01:46.787
Go, V, you got it!
-Go, go, go.

1:01:46.829 --> 1:01:49.081
-You're almost there,
almost there.
-Come on, V.

1:01:50.374 --> 1:01:52.501
-Oh! Yes!
-Oh, my God.

1:01:52.543 --> 1:01:54.294
-Oh shit.
-Yeah!

1:01:54.336 --> 1:01:55.462
-Oh, my God!

1:01:59.550 --> 1:02:02.177
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

1:02:02.219 --> 1:02:03.470
We're going to finals.

1:02:03.512 --> 1:02:05.264
We're going to finals.

1:02:12.438 --> 1:02:15.691
8-Bits, 8-Bits, 8-Bits!

1:02:23.657 --> 1:02:25.534
Last game, my ass.

1:02:25.576 --> 1:02:28.245
Um, what are you doing here?

1:02:28.287 --> 1:02:29.413
I got your email.

1:02:29.455 --> 1:02:30.789
My email?

1:02:32.791 --> 1:02:36.336
What? Roommates share
everything, V, even passwords.

1:02:36.378 --> 1:02:39.756
Oh, you catfished me. I'm out.

1:02:39.798 --> 1:02:42.384
Wait, wait, wait, please.

1:02:42.426 --> 1:02:44.761
I hate seeing you two fighting.

1:02:44.803 --> 1:02:47.806
Can you just stay for a minute,
please. I made tea.

1:02:47.848 --> 1:02:49.141
Indigo.

1:02:49.183 --> 1:02:51.143
And cookies.

1:02:51.894 --> 1:02:53.729
-Cookies.
-Cookies?

1:02:55.898 --> 1:02:57.483
-Fine.
-One cup.

1:02:58.150 --> 1:02:59.151
Very well.

1:03:08.368 --> 1:03:10.954
Heard about the big win.
Everyone's talking about it.

1:03:10.996 --> 1:03:12.456
Gotta say, it was dope.

1:03:12.498 --> 1:03:16.168
-V avenged me.
-After Sloane's sacrifice.

1:03:16.210 --> 1:03:17.169
Mm-hmm.

1:03:19.630 --> 1:03:21.757
Next stop, nationals.

1:03:21.798 --> 1:03:24.176
Hard to believe, right?

1:03:24.218 --> 1:03:27.930
We came a long way
from riding pine
for the dick-smacked Betas.

1:03:27.971 --> 1:03:30.766
Did you ever get
a sneaking suspicion that
they whacked off to us?

1:03:30.807 --> 1:03:33.769
-What, no!
-Oh, totally, they did.

1:03:33.810 --> 1:03:35.729
Get out!
I'd break those dweebs in two.

1:03:35.771 --> 1:03:38.315
I think Adi is
super into you.

1:03:38.357 --> 1:03:39.983
-Adi?
-Mm-hmm.

1:03:40.025 --> 1:03:41.735
That guy smells like cheese.

1:03:46.073 --> 1:03:47.866
I feel kind of funny.

1:03:47.908 --> 1:03:49.826
Yeah, my, like, heart's racing.

1:03:56.333 --> 1:03:58.710
-No.
-What did you do to me?

1:03:59.503 --> 1:04:01.213
Let the waves envelop

1:04:01.255 --> 1:04:03.840
this spiritual reunion.

1:04:04.883 --> 1:04:08.303
You need to open up, V.

1:04:08.345 --> 1:04:10.973
Like an ayahuasca trip.

1:04:11.014 --> 1:04:13.809
-But you're not a shaman.
-Trust me.

1:04:13.850 --> 1:04:16.353
I watched this amazing
Hulu doc on it.

1:04:16.395 --> 1:04:17.813
-Don't fight it.

1:04:18.689 --> 1:04:20.566
Feel it.

1:04:28.532 --> 1:04:32.744
Bonjour!
Je m'appelle Pierre!

1:04:32.786 --> 1:04:35.247
More cookies!

1:04:35.289 --> 1:04:38.208
Le jump, le bounce.

1:04:38.250 --> 1:04:40.877
Eh, boing, boing, boing.
Look at me.

1:04:42.838 --> 1:04:45.424
I'm so soft. Yay!

1:04:45.465 --> 1:04:48.510
Ping! Oopsie, poopsie.

1:04:48.552 --> 1:04:52.097
-So long.

1:04:53.348 --> 1:04:55.767
Stay friends.
Au revoir!

1:05:01.857 --> 1:05:04.651
Hey, you dropped
some change down here.

1:05:04.693 --> 1:05:06.653
My work here is done.

1:05:14.953 --> 1:05:17.414
I'm sorry I was so rude to you.

1:05:19.499 --> 1:05:23.503
There's just so much
pressure to succeed,

1:05:24.838 --> 1:05:26.923
and prove everyone wrong.

1:05:28.258 --> 1:05:32.179
There's no room to just be.

1:05:33.472 --> 1:05:37.267
If anyone gets that, it's me.

1:05:37.309 --> 1:05:41.313
And I'm a trans woman living
in the Midwest.

1:05:41.355 --> 1:05:44.441
There's literally more
Starbucks where I come from

1:05:44.483 --> 1:05:46.443
than there are people
like me.

1:05:47.944 --> 1:05:53.116
I know what it feels like
to not be what everyone expects.

1:05:57.579 --> 1:05:59.247
Well, for what it's worth,

1:06:00.832 --> 1:06:02.626
I think you're perfect.

1:06:16.640 --> 1:06:17.849
Hello!

1:06:17.891 --> 1:06:19.976
I'm back, baby. Surprise!

1:06:20.018 --> 1:06:21.228
Such good friends.

1:06:21.269 --> 1:06:23.063
Oh!

1:06:35.283 --> 1:06:37.828
Thank you.

1:06:37.869 --> 1:06:40.872
Olivera Suites is proud
to welcome collegiate gamers

1:06:40.914 --> 1:06:43.792
-from across the nation.

1:06:43.834 --> 1:06:47.671
Attention gamers, team check-in
is on the mezzanine level.

1:06:47.713 --> 1:06:50.590
-Yeah!

1:06:50.632 --> 1:06:51.883
Oh, look who it is.

1:06:51.925 --> 1:06:54.761
Apparently, they let
anyone in here.

1:06:54.803 --> 1:06:56.763
The Harry Potter convention
is next weekend.

1:06:56.805 --> 1:06:59.433
T-T-T-Trolls in the lobby.

1:06:59.474 --> 1:07:02.686
Oh, Ginny Weasley,
love your work.

1:07:02.728 --> 1:07:05.480
Whatever.
Ginny gets to kiss Harry.

1:07:05.522 --> 1:07:08.650
If they put the sorting hat
on you, you'd be placed
in House Bitch.

1:07:08.692 --> 1:07:11.361
You know, it's really a shame
you won't be coming back
in the fall.

1:07:11.403 --> 1:07:14.114
-You two were the best subs
the Betas ever had.

1:07:14.156 --> 1:07:16.825
They just keep lowering
that glass ceiling
for you all, don't they?

1:07:16.867 --> 1:07:18.744
Dude, raising the glass ceiling.

1:07:18.785 --> 1:07:21.037
Yeah, nice one, Ri-chodo.

1:07:21.079 --> 1:07:22.748
Actually,
I have a secret to tell you.
Wanna step a little closer?

1:07:22.789 --> 1:07:26.126
Ricardo. But I like secrets.

1:07:26.168 --> 1:07:28.044
-Yeah, come here.
-Like here?

1:07:28.086 --> 1:07:29.963
-Yeah, a little bit.
-Okay.

1:07:30.005 --> 1:07:32.507
-Oh, God, no, no, not again.

1:07:32.549 --> 1:07:34.342
No! Not again. Not again.

1:07:34.384 --> 1:07:37.053
-Diane, hold your mouth.

1:07:37.095 --> 1:07:39.598
-Out of here, out of here.
-I drank a bottle of vinegar

1:07:39.639 --> 1:07:41.266
and ate a tablespoon
of baking soda.

1:07:41.308 --> 1:07:43.351
It's like an eighth grade
science fair in here.

1:07:43.393 --> 1:07:45.520
Ugh, nasty, Diane.

1:07:45.562 --> 1:07:47.189
My stomach's really hurting.
Can we go to the room?

1:07:47.230 --> 1:07:48.815
I need to really use
the toilet immediately.

1:07:49.983 --> 1:07:51.735
Hey everyone,
I'm Kelsey Impicciche.

1:07:51.777 --> 1:07:54.196
I'm here at
the national finals in Miami

1:07:54.237 --> 1:07:57.491
and the energy here is insane.
What are you hoping to see?

1:07:57.532 --> 1:08:01.828
-Destruction,
carnage, slaughter.
-I wanna see more wombo combos.

1:08:01.870 --> 1:08:04.664
-I'm hoping
for some surprise games.
-What game are they playing?

1:08:04.706 --> 1:08:07.083
What does it take to win
a team competition like this?

1:08:07.125 --> 1:08:08.543
-Stamina.
-Hunger.

1:08:08.585 --> 1:08:10.086
-Experience.
-Plenty of quarters.

1:08:10.128 --> 1:08:11.880
You gotta keep on
filling those machines up.

1:08:11.922 --> 1:08:13.548
Do you have
any early predictions?

1:08:13.590 --> 1:08:16.384
-Super Mario, am I right?
-Barrett all the way!

1:08:16.426 --> 1:08:18.637
Well, the Newburn Sakka
made it all the way
to the finals last year.

1:08:18.678 --> 1:08:20.430
So, odds are
they can do it again.

1:08:27.312 --> 1:08:32.776
Welcome to the National
eSports Championships,
presented by Mercedes-Benz.

1:08:36.988 --> 1:08:37.864
Good luck.

1:08:41.034 --> 1:08:45.038
Ranked number ten
in the nation and runner-up
at last year's tournament,

1:08:45.080 --> 1:08:51.461
-give a massive welcome
to the Newburn Sakka!
-Yeah, yeah, whoo!

1:08:53.797 --> 1:08:55.632
It's a madhouse out there.

1:08:55.674 --> 1:08:58.093
Yeah, talk about
a baptism by fire.

1:08:58.134 --> 1:09:01.388
And their opponents,
seeded dead last,

1:09:01.429 --> 1:09:04.057
and the only all-women's team
in the tournament...

1:09:04.099 --> 1:09:06.810
-All right, you're up.
Listen, you got this.
-Thanks.

1:09:06.852 --> 1:09:10.480
-Let's go.
You can do it!
-See you out there, Jenna.

1:09:10.522 --> 1:09:14.317
Give it up for the 8-Bits
from Barrett University!

1:09:28.748 --> 1:09:30.166
Oh, yeah, we wanna hear you.

1:09:30.208 --> 1:09:32.669
We wanna hear you. Let's go.

1:09:32.711 --> 1:09:34.045
Yeah, whoo!

1:09:49.436 --> 1:09:50.896
Oh, my goodness.

1:10:01.197 --> 1:10:04.993
Let's get started!

1:10:09.039 --> 1:10:10.540
And the game begins.

1:10:10.582 --> 1:10:14.044
In three, two, one.

1:10:17.422 --> 1:10:20.008
There's no room for error today.

1:10:20.050 --> 1:10:22.844
It's win or game over.

1:10:22.886 --> 1:10:25.013
Whoo! Let's go.

1:10:26.806 --> 1:10:29.517
-Damn, these guys are good.
-It's like fighting a hive mind.

1:10:30.769 --> 1:10:32.729
An ally has been slain.

1:10:32.771 --> 1:10:34.856
That's it. That's it, guys.
Good work, good work.

1:10:34.898 --> 1:10:38.818
Sakka takes an early lead
and pivots up-lane.

1:10:38.860 --> 1:10:41.196
Right, just a little backup
right there.

1:10:41.237 --> 1:10:44.616
Newburn wastes little time
and goes straight
for the jugular.

1:10:44.658 --> 1:10:47.827
Shit! He's on me.
He's on me. He's on me.

1:10:50.664 --> 1:10:53.416
-Yes!
An enemy has been slain.

1:10:53.458 --> 1:10:55.001
-Crap, that was close.
-Sorry.

1:10:55.043 --> 1:10:56.670
Hey, V, come on. Communicate.

1:11:02.133 --> 1:11:05.178
-Oh, yeah! Suck it, ladies!

1:11:05.220 --> 1:11:07.222
Sorry, small objects are
a choking hazard.

1:11:07.263 --> 1:11:09.307
Burn! That's my girl!

1:11:10.850 --> 1:11:14.938
-Ah! I need
a little help down here.
-All right, good work.

1:11:14.980 --> 1:11:17.899
You're playing five different
games out there. Work together!

1:11:17.941 --> 1:11:19.442
-Okay, okay, I'm coming.

1:11:19.484 --> 1:11:21.319
An ally has been slain.

1:11:21.361 --> 1:11:23.863
-Dang it!
-Nice kill, nice kill.

1:11:25.448 --> 1:11:27.617
It's dire out there for Barrett.

1:11:27.659 --> 1:11:30.495
They just can't break through
the Newburn defense.

1:11:31.955 --> 1:11:34.165
Oh, you wanna do this? Fine.

1:11:34.207 --> 1:11:36.960
Yeah, come on down.
That's it, good, good. Whoo!

1:11:39.004 --> 1:11:43.341
Leeroy Jenkins!

1:11:43.383 --> 1:11:45.510
-No, no, no.

1:11:45.552 --> 1:11:47.762
That's a good one.

1:11:47.804 --> 1:11:49.806
Major move
by the Barrett champion
Narbash.

1:11:49.848 --> 1:11:53.184
Creates an opening
in the mid lane.

1:11:53.226 --> 1:11:55.895
An enemy has been slain.

1:11:55.937 --> 1:11:57.939
Hey, she's making a run for it,
guys! Back to the orb!

1:11:57.981 --> 1:12:00.984
A surprise advance
by the 8-Bits captain.

1:12:01.026 --> 1:12:02.944
She has swooped
into the open lane.

1:12:02.986 --> 1:12:04.696
Don't do it, V. Don't do it.

1:12:04.738 --> 1:12:07.073
I need some help here. Come on.

1:12:07.115 --> 1:12:09.492
Sakka scrambles
to block her path.

1:12:12.662 --> 1:12:15.165
Wait, she just
reversed direction.

1:12:15.206 --> 1:12:16.916
Come at me, bros!

1:12:16.958 --> 1:12:18.960
Hey, hey, hey, guys, guys!
Go after her!

1:12:19.002 --> 1:12:21.379
Two Newburn
champions have abandoned
their positions

1:12:21.421 --> 1:12:24.340
-to hunt her down.
-That's it, that's it, come on!

1:12:24.382 --> 1:12:27.761
Is this a suicide mission?
'Cause it sure looks like it.

1:12:27.802 --> 1:12:31.097
-Yeah, we got you, V.
We got you.
-What are you doing?

1:12:31.139 --> 1:12:33.683
Sakka are hot on her heels.

1:12:36.061 --> 1:12:40.231
A big kill!
They have eliminated
the 8-Bits captain.

1:12:40.273 --> 1:12:42.192
I've cleared the path.
You got this.

1:12:42.233 --> 1:12:43.568
Now avenge me.

1:12:44.819 --> 1:12:46.071
Okay.

1:12:46.112 --> 1:12:48.531
Wait a minute!

1:12:48.573 --> 1:12:52.744
The 8-Bit captain's sacrifice
exposed Sakka's backdoor!

1:12:53.953 --> 1:12:55.580
Regroup, come on.

1:12:55.622 --> 1:12:58.750
Come on, boys, back to the orb.
Back to the orb.

1:12:59.959 --> 1:13:01.836
Come on, Slo!

1:13:01.878 --> 1:13:04.464
-Don't look back.
You got it.

1:13:04.506 --> 1:13:08.218
Will they catch
her in time? She's charging
through the mid lane!

1:13:08.259 --> 1:13:11.137
-No, no, no, come on!
It's up for grabs now.

1:13:12.388 --> 1:13:13.473
-They did it!

1:13:13.515 --> 1:13:15.183
She's taken the orb!

1:13:15.225 --> 1:13:16.601
-Yes!

1:13:17.352 --> 1:13:19.979
Yes! Whoo!

1:13:22.273 --> 1:13:26.027
-That's how it's done!

1:13:29.072 --> 1:13:33.785
The 8-Bits advance,
giving us the first upset
of this tournament.

1:13:44.921 --> 1:13:47.090
This match is down to the wire.

1:13:50.176 --> 1:13:51.636
What a win!

1:13:55.682 --> 1:13:58.893
Going, going, and gone!

1:13:58.935 --> 1:14:03.481
-The Cleveland Clerics
just got Cleveland steamed.

1:14:10.363 --> 1:14:12.448
There's no stopping Narbash.

1:14:12.490 --> 1:14:14.409
She's taking out the trash.

1:14:14.450 --> 1:14:17.412
Suck my glove, chode.

1:14:19.664 --> 1:14:23.293
-Whoo, yes!
-Barrett moves on
to the semifinals.

1:14:25.295 --> 1:14:29.757
The questionable gesturing being
displayed does not represent
the views of this tournament.

1:14:29.799 --> 1:14:32.427
What a match!
Are the 8-Bits the real deal?

1:14:32.468 --> 1:14:34.262
Absolutely!

1:14:34.304 --> 1:14:35.930
-Who are the 8-Bits?
-The all-girl team.

1:14:35.972 --> 1:14:38.183
Yeah, I don't--
I don't see gender.

1:14:38.224 --> 1:14:40.143
Oh, my heart screams the 8-Bits,

1:14:40.185 --> 1:14:42.520
-but my brain's telling me...
-The Betas!

1:14:42.562 --> 1:14:45.023
I'm gonna say no.
Is that okay to say no?

1:14:54.782 --> 1:14:58.286
The Betas are going
to the championships for
the second time in two years.

1:14:58.328 --> 1:15:00.163
Uh, yeah, I mean,
was there any doubt? Come on.

1:15:00.205 --> 1:15:02.790
And it looks like your rivals,
the 8-Bits,

1:15:02.832 --> 1:15:05.210
are just one victory away
from joining you.

1:15:05.251 --> 1:15:08.546
Yeah, well, their luck's
about to run out,
so, ticktock, ticktock.

1:15:08.588 --> 1:15:10.965
Well, the rumor is that
the losing Barrett team

1:15:11.007 --> 1:15:13.509
will not be receiving eSports
scholarships next year.
Are you worried?

1:15:13.551 --> 1:15:15.553
Kelsey, I'm-- I'm--
I'm not worried about that.

1:15:15.595 --> 1:15:17.847
I'm about as worried about that
as global warming, okay.

1:15:17.889 --> 1:15:20.433
It doesn't exist.
We've been undefeated
this entire season

1:15:20.475 --> 1:15:22.852
and whoever we're up against,
we're gonna annihilate.

1:15:22.894 --> 1:15:26.689
So, uh, go, Betas.
Go, Betas. Go, Betas.

1:15:26.731 --> 1:15:29.275
And, uh, I'll see you
out there. Whoo!

1:15:30.902 --> 1:15:34.155
It's a regular David
and Goliath matchup here
in this semifinal.

1:15:34.197 --> 1:15:39.202
The 8-Bits are a scrappy bunch,
but if Poughkeepsie
plays their game

1:15:39.244 --> 1:15:43.206
they should make short work
of these overachievers
from Barrett.

1:15:43.248 --> 1:15:44.415
Shut up!

1:15:45.541 --> 1:15:46.793
All right, focus.

1:15:58.805 --> 1:16:00.932
Oh, this chicken.

1:16:01.766 --> 1:16:04.394
Lilly, what are you doing?

1:16:04.435 --> 1:16:07.855
What the hell?
Is that a chicken?

1:16:07.897 --> 1:16:11.359
Well, I like his pretty
feathers and his sharp talons,

1:16:11.401 --> 1:16:13.111
and his cute little beak!

1:16:13.152 --> 1:16:15.446
You've never played
that character before.

1:16:15.488 --> 1:16:17.365
Did you honestly go
full chicken?

1:16:17.407 --> 1:16:19.826
You never go full chicken,
Lilly!

1:16:20.910 --> 1:16:23.413
-Lilly!
-Parker said I could.

1:16:23.454 --> 1:16:26.165
Go with it. Adapt, remember.

1:16:28.459 --> 1:16:30.169
Someone's gonna get
Kentucky Fried.

1:16:30.211 --> 1:16:33.298
Three, two, one.

1:16:33.339 --> 1:16:37.051
Here we go!

1:16:38.219 --> 1:16:41.222
And the semifinals
are underway.

1:16:41.264 --> 1:16:43.433
Stick together as a squad, guys.

1:16:43.474 --> 1:16:44.892
Let's hit 'em hard.

1:16:46.019 --> 1:16:48.229
The Polygons
have come out strong,

1:16:48.271 --> 1:16:49.981
showcasing their early strategy

1:16:50.023 --> 1:16:52.734
by dealing some
impressive damage

1:16:52.775 --> 1:16:54.319
to the 8-Bits carry lane.

1:16:55.570 --> 1:16:57.864
-Oh, my God!
-Good job, good job.

1:16:57.905 --> 1:16:59.699
A quick first kill.

1:16:59.741 --> 1:17:02.076
Keep your head in the game,
guys. Come on!

1:17:02.118 --> 1:17:05.121
The Polygons have eliminated
the 8-Bits' support

1:17:05.163 --> 1:17:07.623
and are pushing
into the mid lane.

1:17:07.665 --> 1:17:10.126
Come on,
consolidate, ladies. Defense!

1:17:10.168 --> 1:17:11.586
Where is everyone?

1:17:11.627 --> 1:17:13.421
-Ally has been slain
-Come on!

1:17:13.463 --> 1:17:14.881
-Double kill.

1:17:14.922 --> 1:17:17.258
We are dead. We're all dead.

1:17:17.300 --> 1:17:20.553
-Two more 8-Bits
bite the dust.
-Okay.

1:17:20.595 --> 1:17:24.766
The Polygons are dominating
the 8-Bits and smell blood.

1:17:24.807 --> 1:17:26.184
There's one left.
Let's get her.

1:17:26.976 --> 1:17:28.811
Hey! Snap out of it!

1:17:28.853 --> 1:17:30.229
Focus.

1:17:33.232 --> 1:17:35.485
And V sneaks away...
-Find her!

1:17:35.526 --> 1:17:37.195
All right.

1:17:37.236 --> 1:17:38.988
She's evaded
the Polygons for now,

1:17:39.030 --> 1:17:40.782
but she's low on health.

1:17:43.242 --> 1:17:44.952
There she is, I see her.

1:17:45.828 --> 1:17:47.413
She's in the jungle.
Let's go!

1:17:47.455 --> 1:17:49.957
The Polygons are back
on the scent.

1:17:50.708 --> 1:17:52.835
Ooh! And a brutal hit.

1:17:52.877 --> 1:17:53.920
On me, on me, on me.

1:17:55.671 --> 1:17:56.964
We got her now.

1:18:02.637 --> 1:18:05.181
-Oh, my God.
-Oh, my God.

1:18:05.223 --> 1:18:07.558
-What the hell is that,
a chicken?

1:18:24.033 --> 1:18:27.286
Ooh! Look at that,
the 8-Bits are back.

1:18:27.328 --> 1:18:30.373
Lilly, the orb! Go!

1:18:30.415 --> 1:18:32.458
It's yours.

1:18:34.669 --> 1:18:36.003
Okay!

1:18:43.386 --> 1:18:46.722
Kill her!

1:18:46.764 --> 1:18:49.392
Go...

1:19:00.153 --> 1:19:05.158

You guys, look.
Look who it is.

You losers aren't dead yet?

You are everything that is

I didn't do this sooner.

I quit!

1:20:36.999 --> 1:20:38.417
Suit yourself, bro.

1:20:39.126 --> 1:20:40.461
Wow.

1:20:40.503 --> 1:20:43.589
-I quit.
-Jeff?

1:20:43.631 --> 1:20:45.132
Same, I quit.

1:20:45.925 --> 1:20:47.051

1:20:47.718 --> 1:20:49.095
What are we gonna do?

1:20:49.136 --> 1:20:52.390
-Hi!

1:20:52.431 --> 1:20:55.851
-We can get them canceled.
-Guys, we can't cancel them.
They're uncancelable.

1:20:55.893 --> 1:20:58.729
Oh. We could play
the long game and get them
hooked onto crystal meth.

1:20:58.771 --> 1:21:01.315
-My stepdad knows--
-Guys, we need
something tonight!

1:21:01.357 --> 1:21:04.360
Yeah, we need
some Tonya Harding shit.

1:21:04.402 --> 1:21:05.570
Yeah.

1:21:06.445 --> 1:21:07.697
Wait, no.

1:21:09.031 --> 1:21:10.366
Maybe.

1:21:10.408 --> 1:21:12.285
Hey.

1:21:13.369 --> 1:21:14.954
You know, I think I got a plan.

1:21:17.957 --> 1:21:21.586
Hi. Thank you.
Keep the change.

1:21:21.627 --> 1:21:22.920
Have a good one.

1:21:24.839 --> 1:21:26.007
Girlies.

1:21:26.048 --> 1:21:28.801
Hell yeah. Huzzah.

1:21:31.095 --> 1:21:33.139
And meet my sisters in arms.

1:21:33.764 --> 1:21:35.641
The 8-Bits.

1:21:35.683 --> 1:21:39.437
I am only as strong
as the goddesses
you see on your screen.

1:21:45.318 --> 1:21:47.111
Can you believe it?

1:21:47.153 --> 1:21:48.404
Nope.

1:21:49.530 --> 1:21:51.866
But I believe in all of you.

1:21:51.907 --> 1:21:53.242
Hell yeah.

1:22:18.267 --> 1:22:19.852
I did it.

1:22:36.202 --> 1:22:39.538
What the hell is that?

1:22:39.580 --> 1:22:41.332
Freeze! Don't move!
Hands in the air!

1:22:42.833 --> 1:22:45.169
Everyone do it now! Hands up!

1:22:46.337 --> 1:22:47.672
You're all under arrest.

1:22:47.713 --> 1:22:49.757
-Can I stream this?
-No!

1:22:49.799 --> 1:22:52.259
-Right, you got it.

1:22:53.177 --> 1:22:54.845
Is the coast clear?

1:22:54.887 --> 1:22:56.931
Open the door.
It's the police.

1:22:56.972 --> 1:22:59.308
Trust me, you do not want me
to open the door.

1:22:59.350 --> 1:23:01.435
Open the door
or we're coming through.

1:23:01.477 --> 1:23:03.854
I really don't think
that's a good idea.

1:23:03.896 --> 1:23:05.564
Open it.

1:23:06.899 --> 1:23:08.859
Keep your hands
where I can see them.

1:23:10.361 --> 1:23:11.987
It's just my Charmin.

1:23:12.029 --> 1:23:13.322
It's ultra soft.

1:23:13.364 --> 1:23:15.324
Whoa, Jesus God.

1:23:15.366 --> 1:23:17.993
-What is that smell?

1:23:18.035 --> 1:23:21.330
-I'm so sorry.

1:23:21.372 --> 1:23:24.500
-Oh, you poor thing.
-I didn't wipe yet.

1:23:24.542 --> 1:23:26.752
Oh, get back in there
and clean up.

1:23:32.383 --> 1:23:34.385
Great, can they leave now?

1:23:34.427 --> 1:23:37.304
Terrorist threats
are no prank, ma'am.

1:23:37.346 --> 1:23:40.182
Including what
your Charmin queen did
to the bathroom last night.

1:23:40.224 --> 1:23:42.893
-Uh, I heard that.
-Yeah, we smelled that.

1:23:42.935 --> 1:23:45.771
Yeah, and you're gonna see that.
Skid mark right down the chair!

1:23:45.813 --> 1:23:49.525
It was a hoax.
They were swatted. You've
really never heard of that?

1:23:49.567 --> 1:23:52.486
Of course, I've heard of it
but we still have to clear
their names.

1:23:52.528 --> 1:23:54.321
Can I just get a real cop?

1:24:01.328 --> 1:24:04.165
-Ma'am?
-Sir?

1:24:04.206 --> 1:24:06.584
-It appears that your team
is free to go.

1:24:06.625 --> 1:24:09.128
-What a surprise!
-Except for you.

1:24:09.170 --> 1:24:13.424
-That is a surprise. What?
-Apparently, an account
registered in your name

1:24:13.466 --> 1:24:16.844
hacked into
the Minecraft e-store
for infinite credits.

1:24:16.886 --> 1:24:18.846
Does that ring any bells?

1:24:18.888 --> 1:24:22.475
-Mom, I can totally explain.
-Mm-hmm.

1:24:22.516 --> 1:24:24.935
You're gonna have to stay here
until we sort this out.

1:24:24.977 --> 1:24:28.105
-Uh, can I have a minute
with my team?
-Sure.

1:24:28.147 --> 1:24:31.692
All right guys,
you have 30 minutes to
get this team onto the field

1:24:31.734 --> 1:24:34.320
-and prepare for war,
you understand?
-Yeah.

1:24:34.361 --> 1:24:37.573
Uh, all right.
So I know I'm always harping on
about how gaming needs to change

1:24:37.615 --> 1:24:40.576
but this team is proof
that it already has.

1:24:40.618 --> 1:24:43.996
You're a bunch of absolute
wackadoodle weirdos,

1:24:44.038 --> 1:24:48.125
and you're brilliant
and I believe in each
and every one of you.

1:24:49.752 --> 1:24:51.086
All right.

1:24:52.797 --> 1:24:54.215
To teamwork.

1:24:54.256 --> 1:24:55.508
To sacrifice.

1:24:55.549 --> 1:24:57.468
-To vengeance.
-Love.

1:24:57.510 --> 1:24:58.886
Acceptance.

1:24:58.928 --> 1:25:00.179
Family.

1:25:00.221 --> 1:25:02.556
One, two, three...

1:25:02.598 --> 1:25:04.225
8-Bits!

1:25:04.266 --> 1:25:06.227
-Whoo!
-Knock 'em dead.

1:25:07.102 --> 1:25:10.022
Wait, really? You finished it?

1:25:10.064 --> 1:25:13.359
Sure did. Took Robo-Manus
down like a punk.

1:25:13.400 --> 1:25:16.237
Full disclosure, I uh,
never beat this one myself.

1:25:18.113 --> 1:25:21.617
When you came into my house,
I was scared.

1:25:21.659 --> 1:25:25.454
I saw a version of what I could
have been if I hadn't given up.

1:25:26.914 --> 1:25:29.834
You win this,
you win it for both of us.

1:25:30.668 --> 1:25:32.169
Good luck.

1:25:32.211 --> 1:25:33.337
Thanks.

1:25:35.422 --> 1:25:36.715
Proud of you.

1:25:43.889 --> 1:25:48.894
Ladies and gentlemen,
it looks like the Barrett 8-Bits
are a no-show.

1:25:48.936 --> 1:25:51.021
-Where's V?
-I-- I don't know.

1:25:53.065 --> 1:25:56.986
They're moments away
from forfeiting
the national championship.

1:25:57.027 --> 1:26:03.492
Nine, eight, seven, six,
five, four, three...

1:26:03.534 --> 1:26:05.870
Oh, no! Oh, no.
Here they come.

1:26:05.911 --> 1:26:07.830
♪ Oh, my God ♪

1:26:19.341 --> 1:26:21.886
♪ 'Cause I'm a beast
Where you at?
I've been unleashed ♪

1:26:21.927 --> 1:26:25.514
-We have a match!

1:26:25.556 --> 1:26:27.766
♪ 'Cause I'm a beast

1:26:27.808 --> 1:26:30.227
♪ I've been unleashed

1:26:30.269 --> 1:26:31.437
Let's go.

1:26:40.029 --> 1:26:44.033
Who's ready to crown
a new national champion?

1:26:46.911 --> 1:26:49.830
Looks like we're gonna have to
get our hands dirty today
after all, boys.

1:26:49.872 --> 1:26:52.541
Oh, do we have
a grudge match today!

1:26:52.583 --> 1:26:55.169
To say these two teams
dislike each other

1:26:55.210 --> 1:26:57.463
is the understatement
of the century.

1:27:00.174 --> 1:27:01.675
-Go, V!
-Whoo!

1:27:15.731 --> 1:27:17.566
Okay, ladies, listen up.

1:27:17.608 --> 1:27:21.612
No matter what they say or do,
we stick to our game.

1:27:21.654 --> 1:27:25.658
-Let's win this for Parker.
-Hell yeah.

1:27:25.699 --> 1:27:28.619
-Got it.
-Whoo!

1:27:31.121 --> 1:27:33.165
Three, two, one.

1:27:33.207 --> 1:27:36.460
-Here we go!

1:27:38.420 --> 1:27:44.385
Both teams appear to be
choosing standard builds,
and sadly, no more chickens.

1:27:44.426 --> 1:27:46.345
Come on, ladies.

1:27:46.387 --> 1:27:49.431
Right out of the game,
the 8-Bits are applying

1:27:49.473 --> 1:27:53.602
some serious pressure as
the first minion waves collide.

1:27:56.814 --> 1:27:57.982
No!

1:27:58.023 --> 1:27:59.650
-Whoo!

1:27:59.692 --> 1:28:01.694
First kill of the night, baby.

1:28:01.735 --> 1:28:04.905
With a quick first kill,
the 8-Bits are in the lead.

1:28:04.947 --> 1:28:07.282
-Keep it up, girls.
-All right, let's go, boys.

1:28:09.785 --> 1:28:13.122
-You shall not pass!
-No!

1:28:13.163 --> 1:28:16.375
-Oh, you wet rat bitch!
-Oh, how do you like that?

1:28:16.417 --> 1:28:19.962
It looks like Narbash has been
Nar-smashed.

1:28:20.004 --> 1:28:22.589
Sloane, probe the line.
Lilly, show no mercy.

1:28:22.631 --> 1:28:24.133
-Roger that.
-No problem.

1:28:25.509 --> 1:28:27.261
And what's this?

1:28:27.302 --> 1:28:29.263
Kallari, pouncing out
from the jungle

1:28:29.304 --> 1:28:31.265
on a pair
of unsuspecting Betas.

1:28:35.519 --> 1:28:36.562
Shit.

1:28:41.984 --> 1:28:43.694
Eat it.

1:28:43.736 --> 1:28:46.989
Ooh, that poor child was ganked
in the jungle.

1:28:47.031 --> 1:28:49.908
The Betas have quickly
evened up the playing field.

1:28:49.950 --> 1:28:51.577
All right, regroup,
regroup.

1:28:53.912 --> 1:28:56.457
8-Bits, 8-Bits...

1:28:56.498 --> 1:29:01.879
8-Bits, 8-Bits,
8-Bits, 8-Bits...

1:29:11.221 --> 1:29:12.681
Go, V! Go!

1:29:14.016 --> 1:29:15.809
V, take my lead.

1:29:15.851 --> 1:29:17.144
Got it.

1:29:18.729 --> 1:29:21.648
-Hey, Dustin's all alone,
it's three-on-one.
-My favorite.

1:29:24.902 --> 1:29:27.529
Shit, they're all over me.
Where are you guys?

1:29:27.571 --> 1:29:29.865
The reigning champs
are on the ropes.

1:29:29.907 --> 1:29:32.993
If the Betas don't rally,
they will lose their title.

1:29:33.035 --> 1:29:34.286
I got you, Captain.

1:29:34.953 --> 1:29:36.121
About time.

1:29:38.874 --> 1:29:40.876
-That was brutal.
-No!

1:29:40.918 --> 1:29:44.838
That wombo combo just
decimated the 8-Bits.

1:29:44.880 --> 1:29:47.549
-Now, that's some real support.
-Support this.

1:29:55.015 --> 1:29:59.895
After the two teams
trade killing blows, we're down
to just the captains.

1:30:08.570 --> 1:30:11.532
Without the support
of her team, the 8-Bits
captain is turning tail

1:30:11.573 --> 1:30:14.034
and fleeing the mid lane.

1:30:14.076 --> 1:30:15.953
Keep running.
Keep trying to run.

1:31:23.729 --> 1:31:24.813
Come on, attack me!

1:31:32.946 --> 1:31:34.114
You can run all day.

1:31:46.460 --> 1:31:47.961
-Ha!

1:31:48.003 --> 1:31:48.837
Shit!

1:31:59.932 --> 1:32:03.268
You got this. Patience, V.

1:32:12.986 --> 1:32:15.572
Wait. Wait for it.

1:32:17.574 --> 1:32:18.867
Now!

1:32:34.716 --> 1:32:36.218
-Yes! Yes!

1:32:36.260 --> 1:32:37.469
The 8-Bits win!

1:32:37.511 --> 1:32:39.513
The 8-Bits win!

1:32:39.554 --> 1:32:41.848
They've won the title!

1:32:46.395 --> 1:32:47.688
Yes! Whoo!

1:33:13.839 --> 1:33:16.842
That game was bullshit!
Each and every one of you
is replaceable.

1:33:16.883 --> 1:33:18.969
Why didn't you do
what you were told?

1:33:19.011 --> 1:33:20.012
Hey.

1:33:23.307 --> 1:33:24.474
Good game.

1:33:36.611 --> 1:33:38.405
Congratulations,

1:33:38.447 --> 1:33:39.740
support.

1:33:44.077 --> 1:33:45.954
-Keep walking, Ricardo.
-No touching.

1:33:49.249 --> 1:33:51.752
Mercedes-Benz proudly presents

1:33:51.793 --> 1:33:56.006
your new national
eSports champions,

1:33:56.048 --> 1:33:59.301
the Barrett University 8-Bits!

1:34:05.307 --> 1:34:07.309
We did it, girls! Yes!

1:34:17.110 --> 1:34:20.072
8-Bits, 8-Bits...

1:34:28.121 --> 1:34:30.374
-V!
-We did it!

1:34:31.541 --> 1:34:34.378
-Look at that thing.
-Owen, hey.

1:34:34.419 --> 1:34:37.798
Congrats, you guys killed
the Betas out there.

1:34:37.839 --> 1:34:40.467
-And you didn't play.
-As much as I would have loved

1:34:40.509 --> 1:34:42.844
to have gotten
my ass kicked by you,

1:34:42.886 --> 1:34:47.015
I couldn't be the good guy
if I kept playing
with the bad guys.

1:34:47.057 --> 1:34:50.477
So, I did a lot of thinking
about it and, you know, I...

1:34:50.519 --> 1:34:52.896
-Ooh.
-Ah.

1:34:52.938 --> 1:34:55.357
Yeah, the cup's in the way.

1:34:55.399 --> 1:34:57.275
Well, that was a moment lost.

1:34:57.317 --> 1:34:58.860
-Here we go.
-Whoa.

1:34:58.902 --> 1:35:00.821
-Sloane, can you take this?
-Roger that.

1:35:06.493 --> 1:35:07.744
Wow.

1:35:07.786 --> 1:35:09.579
You owe me 50 bucks.

1:35:10.956 --> 1:35:12.707
-Oh, move, man.
-Police,
out of the way!

1:35:13.834 --> 1:35:15.752
Stop! You're under arrest!

1:35:15.794 --> 1:35:18.296
What is happening?

1:35:21.591 --> 1:35:23.844
-Stop struggling.
-Get off me!

1:35:23.885 --> 1:35:25.720
You think false threats
are funny?

1:35:25.762 --> 1:35:28.014
Damn it! That was Ricardo!
I didn't do it!

1:35:28.056 --> 1:35:30.517
-No!
-Show mercy.

1:35:30.559 --> 1:35:35.021
-It was Ricardo!
-V, it's an honor to meet you.

1:35:35.063 --> 1:35:39.818
I work with Mercedes-Benz.
How would you feel about
us sponsoring your team?

1:35:39.860 --> 1:35:43.738
-Like at Barrett?
-I was thinking pro.

1:35:43.780 --> 1:35:48.326
We're also throwing in a GLA 250
for each member of the team.

1:35:48.368 --> 1:35:50.203
Oh, my God!

1:35:52.581 --> 1:35:54.416
Yes, yes, yes.

1:35:54.458 --> 1:35:56.293
-We're in.

Ugh, can't open my eyes.

1:36:52.098 --> 1:36:53.850

I can't see.

You guys are shaming me

1:37:06.821 --> 1:37:08.990
And it makes me feel
really embarrassed.

Sorry, Diane.
You're seen here. We love you.

1:37:13.453 --> 1:37:15.914

your national championship.

1:37:37.310 --> 1:37:38.812
But we'll see how you do
in the pro circuit.

1:37:38.853 --> 1:37:40.855
Well, I didn't get my pension,

1:37:40.897 --> 1:37:44.192
but we did get
a win for women everywhere,

1:37:44.234 --> 1:37:46.778
which apparently
is most important.

1:37:46.820 --> 1:37:48.530
-Go 8-Bits!
-1UP. Ding-ding.

1:37:48.572 --> 1:37:49.990
I'm gonna send you
a roll of quarters.

1:37:50.031 --> 1:37:51.741
You're gonna need it,
especially if you're going pro.

1:37:51.783 --> 1:37:53.743
Guess who else is going pro?

1:37:53.785 --> 1:37:56.705

Would you rather a group

bring you back to their base,
tie you to a chair,

1:38:41.541 --> 1:38:45.086
open your mouth
and make you drink orc mead,

1:38:45.128 --> 1:38:48.214
or kiss Ricardo?

1:38:48.256 --> 1:38:50.967
-I'm gonna go with the orc mead.
-Yeah, no-brainer, totally hot.

1:38:51.009 --> 1:38:52.886
-Yeah, definitely the orcs.
-Yeah, the first one.

1:38:52.927 --> 1:38:56.848
-I mean, yeah.
-Hmm, guess I'm an orc girl.

1:38:56.890 --> 1:38:59.643
Okay, Ricardo,
I hope you heard all of that.

1:38:59.684 --> 1:39:02.062
See you when we get
back from LA.

1:39:02.103 --> 1:39:03.647
Bye, Ricardo.

1:39:03.688 --> 1:39:05.732
Why did I have to be
naked for this?

1:39:05.774 --> 1:39:07.192
Bye.
