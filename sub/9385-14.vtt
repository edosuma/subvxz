WEBVTT

00:04.171 --> 00:06.215
I don't want to go
on a rant here

00:06.298 --> 00:09.176
but America's foreign policy
makes about as much sense

00:09.259 --> 00:11.553
as Beowulf having sex
with Robert Fulton

00:11.637 --> 00:13.472
at the First Battle of Antietam.

00:13.555 --> 00:16.225
I mean, when a neoconservative
defenestrates

00:16.308 --> 00:19.770
it's like Raskolnikov
filibuster deoxymonohydroxynate.

00:19.853 --> 00:21.480
What the hell does "rant" mean?

00:21.563 --> 00:25.317

Go, Dust Mites!

00:59.935 --> 01:02.020
I wish they'd put
Chris in already.

01:02.104 --> 01:04.147
Peter, relax.
It's his first game.

01:05.649 --> 01:07.776
Griffin, get in there.

01:07.860 --> 01:08.861
Oh, they're
sending him in.

01:08.944 --> 01:10.028
Yay, Chris!

01:10.112 --> 01:11.113
Attaboy Chris!

01:14.074 --> 01:15.826
Oh, yeah, that's
my son out there.

01:15.909 --> 01:17.286
I taught him
how to wipe.

01:17.369 --> 01:19.037
Why won't you teach
me how to wipe, Dad?

01:19.121 --> 01:20.622
Because you don't
have a bottom, son.

01:20.706 --> 01:21.748
Aw...

01:23.166 --> 01:25.586
Yeah, man, you and
that towel are representin'.

01:25.669 --> 01:27.504
Yo, that sweat's
just frontin', G.

01:27.588 --> 01:31.258
Ladies and gentlemen, the Buddy
Cianci Junior High Cheerleaders.

01:31.341 --> 01:32.509
Is everybody pumped up?!

01:32.593 --> 01:33.594
Yeah!

01:33.677 --> 01:35.804
Give me a D-U-S-T!

01:35.888 --> 01:37.639
D-U-S-T!

01:37.723 --> 01:39.224
M-I-T-E-S!

01:39.308 --> 01:41.185
M-I-T-E-S!

01:41.268 --> 01:42.311
What does that spell?!

01:42.394 --> 01:43.395
Dust Mites!

01:43.478 --> 01:44.688
Who's going to win this game?!

01:44.771 --> 01:45.772
Dust Mites!

01:47.399 --> 01:49.443
My God, what...
what just happened to me?

01:49.526 --> 01:51.111
It's those sirens.

01:51.195 --> 01:54.114
They had us all completely
under their spell

01:54.198 --> 01:55.991
like that hypnotist
at the airport Hilton.

01:59.369 --> 02:01.288
And... three!

02:01.371 --> 02:03.916
Wow. Were we
just hypnotized?

02:03.999 --> 02:06.627
That's incredible.
I don't remember a thing.

02:06.710 --> 02:07.920
Why do I taste crotch?

02:09.379 --> 02:12.633
I must unlock the secret
to their mind-control powers.

02:12.716 --> 02:14.426
Lois, can we go now?
I'm starving.

02:14.510 --> 02:16.011
The game's
almost over, Peter.

02:16.094 --> 02:17.846
Try to think
about something else.

02:51.213 --> 02:55.133
Ah...

02:56.093 --> 02:57.094
Peter!

02:57.177 --> 02:58.387
Oh, sorry.

02:58.470 --> 03:00.097
Hey nice job out
there tonight, Chris.

03:00.180 --> 03:01.807
You wiped the floor
with that towel.

03:01.890 --> 03:03.100
Yo, did y'all check me

03:03.183 --> 03:05.185
when that hottie
was all up in my Kool-Aid?

03:05.269 --> 03:07.855
Yeah, I was looking to break off
a little somethin' somethin'

03:07.938 --> 03:09.815
but my crew gave me
the 411 on that skank

03:09.898 --> 03:11.733
and she's all
about the bling-bling.

03:12.651 --> 03:13.652
Peter, what's wrong?

03:13.735 --> 03:15.404
He's speaking in
tongues, Lois.

03:15.487 --> 03:16.488
Our son is possessed.

03:16.572 --> 03:17.698
Meg, start at Psalm 41

03:17.781 --> 03:19.575
and don't stop reading
till I tell you.

03:19.658 --> 03:21.743
The power of Christ
compels you.

03:21.827 --> 03:22.828
( shrieking )

03:22.953 --> 03:24.204
The power of Christ
compels you.

03:24.329 --> 03:25.330
( shrieking )

03:25.414 --> 03:26.415
Peter, stop.

03:26.498 --> 03:27.624
He's not possessed.

03:27.708 --> 03:29.334
Yeah, he's just talking street.

03:29.418 --> 03:30.419
Lots of kids do it.

03:30.502 --> 03:32.713
Oh. Well, that's
kind of weird.

03:32.796 --> 03:33.964
Pete, that's
just a phase.

03:34.047 --> 03:35.174
You've gone through

03:35.257 --> 03:36.341
a few yourself,
you know.

03:36.425 --> 03:37.634
Yeah, like
those two weeks

03:37.718 --> 03:39.136
you spent
narrating your own life.

03:39.219 --> 03:42.097
I walked into the kitchen
and sat down at the table.

03:42.181 --> 03:44.516
I looked with a grimace
at the questionable meal

03:44.600 --> 03:46.059
Lois had placed
in front of me.

03:46.143 --> 03:48.854
Of course, I'd never tell
her how disgusted I was

03:48.937 --> 03:51.273
with her cooking, but
somehow, I think she knew.

03:51.356 --> 03:53.734
Lois had always been full
of energy and life

03:53.817 --> 03:56.653
but lately I had
begun to grow more aware of her aging.

03:56.737 --> 03:57.863
The bright,
exuberant eyes

03:57.946 --> 03:59.573
that I had fallen
in love with

03:59.656 --> 04:01.742
were now beginning to
grow dull and listless

04:01.825 --> 04:03.785
with the long fatigue
of a weary life.

04:07.122 --> 04:09.791
I awoke several hours
later in a daze.

Hey, Chris,
whatcha doing?

04:29.645 --> 04:30.938
Just layin' back
in da cut

04:31.021 --> 04:32.606
peepin' at this
here homey.

04:32.689 --> 04:34.358
Yo, Pops, me have
some cheddar?

04:34.441 --> 04:35.609
Some player haters

04:35.692 --> 04:36.944
be throwin' salt
in my game

04:37.027 --> 04:38.362
grillin' me
over my gear

04:38.445 --> 04:40.155
and I needs to
be mackin' style.

04:40.239 --> 04:41.406
Well, uh...

04:41.490 --> 04:45.077
the important thing is
you tried, son.

04:46.912 --> 04:48.455
There they are. Very well.

04:48.580 --> 04:50.332
And now to infiltrate this coven

04:50.415 --> 04:52.459
and learn
their mind-control secrets

04:52.543 --> 04:54.461
I just need
to get their attention.

04:54.545 --> 04:56.797
Okay, that was
much better

04:56.880 --> 04:59.174
but it still sucked worse
than anything I've ever seen.

04:59.258 --> 05:00.801
What's wrong
with you guys?

05:27.160 --> 05:28.704
Oh, look how
cute he is.

05:28.787 --> 05:31.123
He must be one
of the teachers' babies.

05:31.206 --> 05:33.709
Oh, he wants to be
a cheerleader, too.

05:33.792 --> 05:35.878
My, so it's that easy
to win you over.

05:35.961 --> 05:37.838
Oh, consider
yourselves lucky

05:37.921 --> 05:39.506
I'm not after
your gully-holes.

05:41.800 --> 05:43.135
And, and, and then
Chris starts in

05:43.218 --> 05:44.386
with all this
"yo-yo-yo" stuff

05:44.469 --> 05:45.679
and I-I don't know

05:45.762 --> 05:47.055
what the hell
he's talking about.

05:47.139 --> 05:48.891
So I started
beating him with a hose

05:48.974 --> 05:50.809
then my arm got tired
and so I came here.

05:50.893 --> 05:52.603
Peter, perhaps
Chris has adopted

05:52.686 --> 05:54.146
another culture's
mannerisms

05:54.229 --> 05:56.940
because he doesn't know
enough about his own.

05:57.024 --> 05:58.400
Aw, gee,
I never thought of that.

05:58.483 --> 06:01.153
Hey, you know, I should teach
Chris about his Irish roots.

06:01.236 --> 06:03.030
Besides, we haven't
spent any time together

06:03.113 --> 06:04.406
since we played Operation.

06:04.489 --> 06:06.909
I'm going
for the funny bone, Dad.

06:06.992 --> 06:08.243
Oh, you touched
the sides.

06:08.327 --> 06:09.578
Aw, geez,
he's waking up.

06:09.661 --> 06:11.914
Quick, let's get him
back to the bus station.

06:13.749 --> 06:15.292
Dad, I don't
want to be here.

06:15.375 --> 06:17.252
I want to be chillin'
with my homeys.

06:17.336 --> 06:18.712
Now, Chris,
it's important

06:18.795 --> 06:20.631
you learn about
your Irish heritage.

06:31.683 --> 06:33.352
( praying )

06:33.435 --> 06:34.937
( crying )

06:35.020 --> 06:36.522
( praying )

06:36.605 --> 06:38.607
( crying )

06:38.690 --> 06:40.943
Ancient archaeological
evidence indicates

06:41.026 --> 06:42.986
that Ireland was a
much different place

06:43.070 --> 06:44.988
before the discovery
of alcohol.

06:45.072 --> 06:47.699
Most experts believe it
was something like this.

06:51.411 --> 06:53.956
Gentlemen, today we,
Ireland's top scientists

06:54.039 --> 06:55.707
have found a way
to convert

06:55.791 --> 06:57.709
our entire population
to pure energy.

06:57.793 --> 06:59.253
Oh, it's a
glorious day.

06:59.336 --> 07:00.546
It's a glorious day.

07:00.629 --> 07:02.130
Hey, Michael McLeod's
just invented

07:02.214 --> 07:04.550
a new kind of beverage
in his basement.

07:04.633 --> 07:06.385
Hmm. Whiskey.

07:09.137 --> 07:10.889
( laughing, shrieking )

07:17.229 --> 07:19.314
You were right, Dad.
Being Irish rocks.

07:19.398 --> 07:20.816
That's more like it, son.

07:20.899 --> 07:22.401
Now, today
we're going to learn

07:22.484 --> 07:24.194
about the Griffin
family history.

07:24.278 --> 07:25.571
What's a library, Dad?

07:25.654 --> 07:27.948
Oh, it's just a place
where homeless people

07:28.031 --> 07:29.491
come to shave
and go B.M.

07:29.575 --> 07:30.742
Let's go inside.

07:32.369 --> 07:35.664
Look, Dad, I found this
book on our genealogy.

07:35.747 --> 07:36.999
Huh. Way to go, son.

07:37.082 --> 07:38.667
Hey, look, here's a picture

07:38.750 --> 07:41.336
of your great-great-
granddad, Osias Griffin.

07:41.420 --> 07:43.964
He owned one of the
first dozen telephones.

07:44.047 --> 07:45.090
( phone ringing )

07:45.174 --> 07:46.175
Hello?

07:46.258 --> 07:47.259
Hello, Jonathan?

07:47.342 --> 07:48.927
No, what number are you calling?

07:49.011 --> 07:50.012
Seven.
Well, this is three.

07:50.095 --> 07:51.346
Oh, sorry.

07:51.430 --> 07:53.307
And his great-grandpa

07:53.390 --> 07:55.684
was Thomas Griffin,
a great philosopher.

07:55.767 --> 07:56.894
Thomas, would
you please

07:56.977 --> 07:58.604
go look for a job.

07:58.687 --> 08:00.731
Why?

08:00.814 --> 08:01.899
Wow! That's cool.

08:01.982 --> 08:03.692
Go back even further, Dad.

08:03.775 --> 08:05.611
Okay, settle down, spaz.

08:05.694 --> 08:09.615
"In 1840, Nathaniel 'Nate'
Griffin used to groom horses."

08:09.698 --> 08:10.866
What the hell...?

08:13.702 --> 08:15.954
Holy crap, I'm black.

08:20.042 --> 08:21.543
But I... I...
I can't be black.

08:21.627 --> 08:23.253
I got to say, Peter

08:23.337 --> 08:25.839
the man in this book does
look an awful lot like you.

08:25.923 --> 08:27.841
The Diary of Nate Griffin.

08:27.925 --> 08:30.052
"May 7, 1836.

08:30.135 --> 08:32.804
"I was brushing down Lucy,
the new colt

08:32.888 --> 08:35.724
"when she let out a fart
right near my face.

08:35.807 --> 08:38.560
"So I took her head
and stuck it by my butt

08:38.644 --> 08:41.188
and blew a huge fart
right back at her."

08:41.271 --> 08:42.481
( laughing )

08:42.564 --> 08:44.358
Oh, uh...
that laugh's in here, too.

08:44.441 --> 08:45.776
See? "Hehehehehehehe."

08:45.859 --> 08:47.528
Wow. Then it's true.

08:47.611 --> 08:50.072
Cool! I get
to be black and Irish!

08:50.155 --> 08:52.032
Yeah, and now I can wear clothes

08:52.115 --> 08:53.909
that actually show off
my big butt!

08:53.992 --> 08:55.077
Oh, I got
to tell Bonnie

08:55.160 --> 08:56.912
I'm sleeping
with a black man!

08:58.497 --> 09:00.541
Oh, my God!
Update! Exclaim!

09:00.624 --> 09:03.043
Scott Martin just
asked me out again.

09:03.126 --> 09:04.837
Oh, my God, this
is date number three!

09:05.045 --> 09:06.964
Are you going to let
him get to second base?

09:07.047 --> 09:09.132
I think that
would be a bad idea

09:09.216 --> 09:11.802
and I know something
about bad ideas.

09:11.885 --> 09:13.595
I'm...
I'm telling you, Juice

09:13.679 --> 09:15.931
she's screwing around
behind your back.

09:16.014 --> 09:18.308
And, if I were
in your Bruno Maglis

09:18.392 --> 09:19.810
I wouldn't stand for it.

09:19.893 --> 09:20.894
Another mai tai.

09:21.186 --> 09:22.187
Thanks.

09:22.271 --> 09:24.606
So, listen...

09:24.690 --> 09:25.858
Here comes Scott.

09:25.941 --> 09:27.442
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

09:30.612 --> 09:32.239
( laughing )

09:32.322 --> 09:35.492
Have yet to discover the secret
of their mind-control powers.

09:35.576 --> 09:37.995
Also, trying to comprehend
their obsession

09:38.078 --> 09:39.913
with the homosexuals
from 'N Sync.

09:42.457 --> 09:44.126
Hey, uh, Cleveland,
you got a minute?

09:44.209 --> 09:45.711
I really need
to talk to you.

09:45.794 --> 09:47.546
Sure, I was just
going for a ride.

09:47.629 --> 09:49.131
Hop on.

09:51.383 --> 09:53.677
So, I found out
I have a black ancestor.

09:53.760 --> 09:55.137
Is that right?

09:55.220 --> 09:56.513
Well, that's
fantastic, Peter.

09:56.597 --> 09:57.806
Yeah, but see,
the problem is

09:57.890 --> 09:59.975
I, I, I got no idea
how to be black.

10:00.058 --> 10:03.020
Except for not smiling when
I get my picture taken.

10:03.103 --> 10:04.938
Well, Peter, it sounds like

10:05.022 --> 10:06.899
you should go out and commingle

10:06.982 --> 10:09.067
amongst your newly found
brethren.

10:09.151 --> 10:11.111
You know, absorb the culture.

10:11.195 --> 10:12.946
Wheelie time!

10:13.030 --> 10:14.865
Yee-haw!
Aah!

10:14.948 --> 10:16.742
You know, you're
right, Cleveland.

10:16.825 --> 10:18.493
I should be hanging
around more black people like myself.

10:18.577 --> 10:19.578
Thanks.

10:21.455 --> 10:22.915
( motorcycle idling loudly)

10:22.998 --> 10:24.416
Hey, Peter, what the...

10:24.499 --> 10:25.626
It's the vibration.

10:27.336 --> 10:29.379
Who here used to wear
a lot of Jherri Curl?

10:29.463 --> 10:31.507
Yeah, that's right.

10:31.632 --> 10:33.675
Y'all know that
Exxon Valdez thing?

10:33.967 --> 10:35.469
That ain't how it happened.

10:35.552 --> 10:37.179
Some brother just fell
in the ocean.

10:37.262 --> 10:38.430
( laughing )

10:38.514 --> 10:39.765
Oh, God, I remember that.

10:39.848 --> 10:42.809
And all those seals died.

10:42.893 --> 10:45.979
It was...
it was all over the news.

10:46.063 --> 10:48.899
The Channel 2 News
with Dan Rather.

10:49.024 --> 10:50.776
Although I think Connie Chung

10:50.859 --> 10:55.489
might have been substituting
for him that night.

10:55.572 --> 10:59.618
Well, about time for me to be
hitting the old dusty trail.

11:01.328 --> 11:02.913
I like your hat.

11:04.748 --> 11:06.208
Can't get out that way.

11:09.461 --> 11:11.213
( alarm blaring )

11:11.338 --> 11:13.632
Oh, found the
emergency exit.

11:14.925 --> 11:17.344
And 1967 was the same year

11:17.427 --> 11:19.763
that Thurgood Marshall
was named to the Supreme Court

11:19.847 --> 11:21.056
of the United States.

11:21.139 --> 11:22.266
Woo! Woo! Woo! Woo!

11:22.349 --> 11:24.685
Woo! Woo! Woo!
Woo! Woo! Woo! Woo!

11:26.687 --> 11:29.982
Well, I should probably
be saddling up now.

11:31.817 --> 11:33.735
( alarm blaring )

11:33.819 --> 11:35.863
Oh, found the fire door.

11:37.322 --> 11:40.242
Ugh, look at how fat you are.

11:40.325 --> 11:41.910
You disgust me.

11:41.994 --> 11:43.829
Oink-oink, fatty.

11:43.912 --> 11:46.832
Oh, yes, you'll take butter on
that English muffin, won't you

11:46.915 --> 11:49.418
because you're the cheerleading
squad's token blimp.

11:49.501 --> 11:52.171
You don't deserve to eat.

11:52.254 --> 11:53.255
( retches )

11:56.300 --> 11:58.093
Hey, thanks for bringing
me here, Cleveland.

11:58.177 --> 12:00.387
Welcome.
For our first order of business

12:00.470 --> 12:02.764
I believe Brother Cleveland
has an announcement.

12:02.848 --> 12:06.143
Yesterday I received reparations

12:06.226 --> 12:08.937
from the family
that enslaved my ancestors.

12:09.021 --> 12:10.439
Amen!
( applause )

12:10.522 --> 12:13.609
Now the family has become
poor white trash since then

12:13.692 --> 12:16.069
so they only gave
what they could--

12:16.153 --> 12:19.198
this tray of scrumptious
Rice Krispie treats.

12:19.281 --> 12:21.617
I share them with all of you
in the hopes

12:21.700 --> 12:24.995
that one day your wounds
may be healed as well.

12:25.078 --> 12:26.914
-Amen!
-Right on, man, right on.

12:26.997 --> 12:28.290
Hey, why is he taking one?

12:28.373 --> 12:30.334
Oh, this is my friend
Peter Griffin.

12:30.417 --> 12:32.753
He recently discovered
he was black.

12:32.836 --> 12:34.546
He doesn't look
very black to me.

12:34.671 --> 12:35.881
Oh, gentlemen, gentlemen

12:36.048 --> 12:37.382
gentlemen, please.

12:37.466 --> 12:39.593
Please, judge me not
by the color of my skin

12:39.676 --> 12:41.303
for I have always
been there with you.

12:41.386 --> 12:43.096
( murmuring dissent )

12:43.180 --> 12:44.681
I was there when
George and Weezie

12:44.765 --> 12:45.807
moved on up to the East Side.

12:45.891 --> 12:46.892
Sing it!
Movin' on up.

12:46.975 --> 12:48.227
Now you talking history.

12:48.310 --> 12:50.979
Hallelujah,
those were happy times.

12:51.063 --> 12:52.940
Yes, but, but I was also there
for the bad times.

12:53.023 --> 12:54.483
Yes, he was.
Uh-huh.

12:54.566 --> 12:57.069
When Florida lost James
to that tragic auto accident.

12:57.152 --> 12:59.947
Now you talking real.

13:00.030 --> 13:02.991
And I was there when Tootie got
those terribly painful braces.

13:03.075 --> 13:04.701
Oh, yeah, that hurt.

13:04.785 --> 13:07.162
Oh, yes, and when Arnold Jackson
got beat up by the Gooch

13:07.246 --> 13:09.414
I was there.

13:09.498 --> 13:11.708
So before you decide
that I don't belong here

13:11.792 --> 13:13.168
remember this--

13:13.252 --> 13:14.837
I was there!

13:14.920 --> 13:16.547
( cheering )

13:22.636 --> 13:23.846
Way to go, Peter.

13:23.929 --> 13:25.389
You tell it like it is.

13:27.432 --> 13:28.892
Now, Chris,
this one's for you:

13:28.976 --> 13:30.102
What's the secret
to happiness?

13:30.185 --> 13:31.270
Money.

13:31.395 --> 13:32.396
Very good.

13:32.479 --> 13:33.480
Babs, give him a caramel.

13:40.028 --> 13:41.405
Hey-hey-hey.

13:41.488 --> 13:43.282
Hey, Lois, what are
your parents doing here?

13:43.365 --> 13:45.158
Oh, they surprised us
with a visit

13:45.242 --> 13:47.744
after I told them
about your recent discovery.

13:47.828 --> 13:50.539
Yes, Peter, we hear
you're a Negro now.

13:50.622 --> 13:52.124
Yep, I even got
my own posse.

13:52.207 --> 13:54.251
Hey, uh, Big Dog,
T-Bone, Shades

13:54.334 --> 13:56.253
you guys
go make yourself some sandwiches.

13:56.336 --> 13:57.713
We'll hook up later.

13:57.796 --> 14:00.174
My jacket's in the kitchen.
Please don't write on it.

14:00.257 --> 14:02.426
Well, I think Chris and Meg
should know

14:02.509 --> 14:04.928
the Pewterschmidt side
of their ancestry, too.

14:05.012 --> 14:06.305
Kids, did you know
the Pewterschmidts

14:06.388 --> 14:08.390
were among the first
to colonize America?

14:08.473 --> 14:10.934
Now, kids, don't be taken in
by the Man.

14:11.018 --> 14:12.394
Stay black and proud.

14:12.519 --> 14:13.520
Here's your ancestor

14:13.604 --> 14:14.980
Silas Pewterschmidt

14:15.063 --> 14:16.523
bartering with
some local Indians.

14:16.607 --> 14:18.066
-Cool.
-And here's a picture of...

14:18.150 --> 14:19.610
Oh, uh, never mind that one.

14:19.693 --> 14:20.819
Wait, wait, wait,
what was that?

14:20.903 --> 14:22.237
Oh, that was nothing.

14:22.321 --> 14:23.989
Just some fellow
we fed and took care of

14:24.072 --> 14:25.490
in exchange for doing
a few chores.

14:25.574 --> 14:27.159
You mean a slave.
Let me see that.

14:27.242 --> 14:29.328
Oh, my God.

14:29.411 --> 14:32.623
It's Nate Griffin.

14:32.706 --> 14:37.211
Well, 'bout time for me to be
hitting the old dusty trail.

14:39.755 --> 14:42.299
Lois, your family
owned my family.

14:42.424 --> 14:43.509
Daddy, is that true?

14:43.592 --> 14:44.885
Well, it appears so.

14:44.968 --> 14:46.178
Boy, this is pretty
embarrassing.

14:46.261 --> 14:48.222
Yes, it is. And don't
call me "boy!"

14:48.305 --> 14:50.390
Peter, please, calm down.

14:50.474 --> 14:52.100
Babs, I think it's time
we went to bed.

14:52.184 --> 14:53.894
Things will look better
in the morning.

14:53.977 --> 14:56.605
Come here, kids. Give Grandma
and Grandpa a kiss good night.

14:58.106 --> 14:59.233
Whoa!

14:59.316 --> 15:00.859
Ah!

15:00.943 --> 15:02.611
You can whip me all you like,
white devil

15:02.736 --> 15:04.780
but you'll never
break my spirit.

15:12.246 --> 15:14.414
Damn. There must be some clue
to the source

15:14.498 --> 15:16.708
of their mental
manipulation techniques.

15:16.792 --> 15:18.877
"Your Body and You."

15:18.961 --> 15:20.754
"Every four weeks
for three to four days

15:20.838 --> 15:22.714
it's entirely normal
for every young woman to..."

15:22.798 --> 15:25.050
Oh, my God! Oh!

15:25.133 --> 15:27.386
That's the most disgusting thing
I've ever heard in my life!

15:27.469 --> 15:29.263
Oh!

15:29.346 --> 15:31.098
( girls talking )

15:31.181 --> 15:32.766
That totally sucked.

15:32.850 --> 15:34.560
You guys call yourselves
cheerleaders.

15:34.768 --> 15:37.437
Well, I call you cheerlosers!

15:37.521 --> 15:39.940
This Cindi is definitely
the alpha of the group.

15:40.023 --> 15:41.525
And what happened
with the pyramid?

15:41.608 --> 15:43.110
I almost broke my neck.

15:43.193 --> 15:44.403
( gasps ):
The pyramid!

15:44.486 --> 15:45.821
Of course.

15:45.904 --> 15:47.531
That must be the key
to their power.

15:47.614 --> 15:49.408
Mission objective:
eliminate Cindi

15:49.491 --> 15:51.451
and take her place
at the top of the pyramid.

15:51.535 --> 15:53.954
( gasps ):
They're getting nude.

15:54.037 --> 15:55.789
I mustn't watch.
It's not the proper thing to...

15:55.873 --> 15:58.792
Whoa! I say, nice ones, Janine.

15:58.876 --> 16:01.795
And look at Lisa
in all of her curvaceous glory.

16:01.879 --> 16:03.714
Oh, Heavens, it appears
that my wee-wee

16:03.797 --> 16:05.299
has been stricken
with rigor mortis.

16:08.802 --> 16:10.137
Good morning.

16:10.220 --> 16:11.680
Peter, what on earth
are you wearing?

16:11.763 --> 16:12.931
It's a dashiki.

16:13.015 --> 16:14.016
And don't call me Peter.

16:14.099 --> 16:15.100
That's my slave name.

16:15.184 --> 16:17.728
From now on, call me
Kichwa-Tembo.

16:17.811 --> 16:20.439
Cool.
And I'll be Mambutu O'Malley.

16:20.522 --> 16:21.982
Peter...
Kichwa.

16:22.065 --> 16:23.942
I'd like to have
a word with you.

16:24.026 --> 16:25.402
Peter, I think...

16:25.485 --> 16:26.862
Kichwa!

16:26.945 --> 16:29.198
( sighs ):
Kichwa, we're both sensible men.

16:29.281 --> 16:31.867
There must be something I can do
to make things right with you.

16:31.950 --> 16:32.951
Actually, there is.

16:33.035 --> 16:34.161
I want reparations

16:34.244 --> 16:35.412
just like
Cleveland got.

16:35.495 --> 16:36.955
What the hell
are you talking about?

16:37.039 --> 16:39.875
I want an apology and
some Rice Krispie treats.

16:39.958 --> 16:42.002
Well, I absolutely will not
give you an apology.

16:42.085 --> 16:43.587
And I'm assuming
"Rice Krispie treats"

16:43.670 --> 16:46.256
is black slang for money,
so here's $10,000.

16:46.340 --> 16:48.008
And I expect you
never to mention

16:48.091 --> 16:49.468
this ugly business again.

16:49.551 --> 16:51.094
$10,000?

16:51.178 --> 16:52.304
Not enough? Fine, make it 20.

16:52.387 --> 16:53.597
How do you spell "Kichwa"?

16:53.680 --> 16:55.098
You know what,
screw the Kichwa.

16:55.182 --> 16:57.601
Make it out to Peter.
P-E-T-E...

16:57.684 --> 17:00.437
This just in: Slave owner
descendant Carter Pewterschmidt

17:00.521 --> 17:03.899
has paid $20,000
or two million pennies

17:03.982 --> 17:06.193
in reparations
to a local black man.

17:06.276 --> 17:08.320
We now go live
to the local black man.

17:08.403 --> 17:12.991
Well, the money helps, but I'll
always feel my ancestors' pain.

17:13.075 --> 17:15.327
( laughs ):
Hey, from down there does it look like

17:15.410 --> 17:17.663
I'm talking into
a bunch of robot penises?

17:19.623 --> 17:20.999
Hey, Lois, come in here

17:21.124 --> 17:22.960
and see what I did
with the money your dad gave me.

17:23.043 --> 17:25.045
( gasps ):
Oh, my God.

17:25.128 --> 17:27.673
You turned the den
into Pee Wee's Playhouse?

17:27.756 --> 17:29.007
♪♪ Come on, get up ♪♪

17:29.091 --> 17:31.593

17:46.775 --> 17:48.068
Hey, Jambi!

17:49.236 --> 17:50.612
Okay, say it.

17:50.821 --> 17:52.531
Mekka-lekka-hi, mekka-hiney...

17:52.614 --> 17:54.116
God, I hate you so much.

17:54.199 --> 17:55.450
Peter, that reparation money

17:55.534 --> 17:57.661
should be going to
a worthy black charity.

17:57.744 --> 18:00.122
Lois, the King of Cartoons
will be here in five minutes

18:00.205 --> 18:01.832
and I will not have you
embarrass me.

18:01.915 --> 18:03.041
You're acting ridiculous.

18:03.125 --> 18:04.668
( yelling ):
Aggh!

18:04.751 --> 18:06.795
You said the secret word!

18:07.921 --> 18:09.006
( siren blares )

18:09.464 --> 18:10.757
Uh-oh.

18:12.593 --> 18:13.844
Hey, you're
that black guy

18:13.927 --> 18:15.262
I saw on the news
conference, ain't ya?

18:15.345 --> 18:16.513
Uh, yeah, that's me.

18:16.597 --> 18:18.223
This is car 15, I'm
going to need backup.

18:18.307 --> 18:19.725
I've got a stolen
vehicle here.

18:19.808 --> 18:21.685
-But this is my car...
-Suspect's getting belligerent.

18:21.768 --> 18:23.562
What?
Officer down.

18:27.357 --> 18:28.692
So it's agreed.

18:28.775 --> 18:30.569
We'll keep on pretending
to like pigs' feet

18:30.652 --> 18:32.487
simply to confound
the white man.

18:32.571 --> 18:34.198
Oh, sorry I'm late, you guys.

18:34.281 --> 18:36.200
The white man was
making me his bitch.

18:37.159 --> 18:40.120
What? Oh, sorry.
His be-yatch.

18:40.204 --> 18:42.456
Peter, we know about
your selfish squandering

18:42.539 --> 18:44.416
of your
reparation money.

18:44.499 --> 18:45.959
I shared mine.

18:46.043 --> 18:48.712
You, however, have given nothing
back to the community.

18:48.795 --> 18:50.923
Uh, that's not true.

18:51.006 --> 18:53.592
I've brought you
the greatest gift of all:

18:53.675 --> 18:55.427
a child's laughter.

18:55.511 --> 18:59.389
( high-pitched giggle )

18:59.598 --> 19:01.475
Peter, I think you should go.

19:01.558 --> 19:02.559
Yeah, I'm gone.

19:07.189 --> 19:09.107
Hi, guys.

19:09.191 --> 19:11.777
Uh, hey, how's it going?

19:11.860 --> 19:13.904
Geez, Lois, no one
wants to sit with me.

19:13.987 --> 19:15.155
It's like I'm
a freakin' leper.

19:15.447 --> 19:16.698
Hey, can we
sit there?

19:16.782 --> 19:18.617
No, these are saved.

19:18.700 --> 19:20.077
Where is Cindi?

19:20.160 --> 19:21.787
I don't know, but she
better show up soon.

19:21.870 --> 19:22.996
It's almost half-time.

19:23.914 --> 19:25.666
You know, Cindi, I'd
feel worse about this

19:25.749 --> 19:26.959
if you didn't
spell your name

19:27.042 --> 19:28.919
with that insufferable
"I" at the end.

19:29.002 --> 19:31.964
Oh, and that
cockadoody smiley face you use to dot it.

19:32.172 --> 19:33.507
You sicken me!

19:33.590 --> 19:35.467
I'm not going to hurt you.
I'm not going to hurt you.

19:42.432 --> 19:44.268
Ah!

19:44.351 --> 19:45.352
Hello, Peter.

19:45.435 --> 19:47.896
Nate Griffin.

19:47.980 --> 19:49.565
Oh, my God,
you're haunting me

19:49.648 --> 19:51.275
because I've been
a terrible black man.

19:51.358 --> 19:52.442
Peter, you got to stop

19:52.526 --> 19:54.194
putting so much
importance on race.

19:54.278 --> 19:55.279
I know I didn't.

19:55.362 --> 19:56.613
-You didn't?
-No.

19:56.697 --> 19:58.031
If I had, do you think
I would've slept

19:58.115 --> 19:59.908
with your white great-great-
great-great granny?

19:59.992 --> 20:01.243
I guess not.

20:01.410 --> 20:02.744
That's right.
And I wouldn't have slept

20:02.828 --> 20:04.246
with her fine sister neither.

20:04.329 --> 20:05.914
You see, Peter,
the most important thing

20:05.998 --> 20:07.374
is how a man acts.

20:07.791 --> 20:08.876
You know what I'm getting at?

20:08.959 --> 20:11.044
You think I should
do something good

20:11.128 --> 20:12.838
with that reparation money,
don't you?

20:12.921 --> 20:14.214
That'd be mighty fine,
Peter.

20:14.339 --> 20:16.008
Eh, I guess
you're right.

20:16.091 --> 20:17.384
Listen, for what it's worth

20:17.467 --> 20:18.927
I'm real sorry
my wife's ancestors

20:19.011 --> 20:20.179
made you suffer so much.

20:20.262 --> 20:21.471
Oh, don't worry about me.

20:21.555 --> 20:23.015
If it makes you
feel any better

20:23.098 --> 20:24.683
I peed in their cereal
every morning.

20:24.766 --> 20:26.351
Hehehehehe!
Hehehehehe!

20:26.435 --> 20:27.853
Well, so long, Peter.

20:27.936 --> 20:29.479
Wait, wait, wait.
Before you go...

20:29.563 --> 20:31.190
what's heaven like?

20:31.273 --> 20:32.441
Oh, it's fine.

20:32.524 --> 20:34.276
There's a shortage of chairs.

20:34.818 --> 20:36.195
Oh.

20:36.278 --> 20:37.988
Yeah.

20:38.071 --> 20:39.615
Take it easy, Peter.

20:41.575 --> 20:44.620
Okay, look, we're just going
to have to go on without her.

20:44.703 --> 20:48.165
( up-tempo music starts )

20:53.837 --> 20:56.673
Give me a "D"!
"D"!

20:56.757 --> 20:58.717
That's enough of that.
There's a large hunting knife

20:58.800 --> 21:00.093
under each one of your seats.

21:00.177 --> 21:02.304
Oh, my command, I want you to...
Aah!

21:03.764 --> 21:05.682
Ah! You idiots, I had them!

21:05.933 --> 21:08.268
Oh, Cindi was right.
We need a lot more work.

21:09.394 --> 21:10.979
Uh, excuse me.

21:11.063 --> 21:13.524
Yeah, uh, hi, I'm Peter Griffin.

21:13.607 --> 21:15.984
Listen, uh,
as many of you may know

21:16.068 --> 21:18.612
I recently came into some money.

21:18.695 --> 21:21.114
Well, I don't really deserve it.

21:21.198 --> 21:25.077
So I've decided to share it
with my brothers.

21:28.205 --> 21:31.667
Uh, actually, I just meant
the black guys. Uh.

21:31.750 --> 21:33.877
Peter, that was
very generous.

21:33.961 --> 21:35.712
And look how happy
you've made everyone.

21:35.796 --> 21:37.548
Yeah, it just goes
to show you, Lois.

21:37.631 --> 21:39.550
It doesn't matter if
you're black or white

21:39.633 --> 21:42.469
the only color that
really matters is green.

21:42.553 --> 21:43.720
Oh, Peter.

21:45.055 --> 21:47.307
I wonder what
happened to Cindi.

21:51.353 --> 21:53.397
Dear diary...

21:53.480 --> 21:54.648
jackpot.

21:57.526 --> 22:00.779
( rap version
of theme song plays )
