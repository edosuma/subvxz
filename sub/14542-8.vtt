00:04.960 --> 00:06.519
- Why'd you do it?
- 'Cause we needed him,

00:06.680 --> 00:08.796
- and you asked me to.
- You have to tell me

00:08.960 --> 00:10.473
- where my son is.
- One thing at a time.

00:12.240 --> 00:13.594
You set off a bomb in my town.

00:13.760 --> 00:17.116
Your job is to keep our
town healthy and compliant,

00:17.280 --> 00:19.396

It's the training.</i>

00:22.720 --> 00:24.677
You cut him loose,
he will kill us both.

<i>Tom: You were so worried
about trusting my son,</i>

00:26.800 --> 00:28.473
<i>when you should've been
worried about trusting me.</i>

00:28.640 --> 00:30.631
You said your husband
was Patriot high command?

00:30.840 --> 00:33.434
- What do you want?
- Where is the old ball and chain?

00:33.600 --> 00:35.716
I'd like to pick your brain
about the nanotech.

00:35.880 --> 00:38.793
He's already onto the bodies.
Aaron, it's only a matter of time

00:38.960 --> 00:40.792
- before Horn is onto you.
- So where are they?

<i>Miles: I did not want to be right
about this. He's one of them.</i>

00:44.120 --> 00:45.952
- We got to get Aaron out of here.
- I'm Aaron Pittman!

00:46.120 --> 00:48.509
I'll come quietly!
Just leave her alone!

00:51.000 --> 00:53.276
<i>Man: Aaron, you have got to
tell me how you do that.</i>

00:53.440 --> 00:54.555
You don't have to be afraid of him,

00:54.720 --> 00:57.360

you're afraid of, is it?

01:18.560 --> 01:19.959

01:23.000 --> 01:25.560
I haven't seen the son of a bitch
in a while,

01:25.720 --> 01:27.711
but I'm pretty sure you
know where he's holed up.

01:27.880 --> 01:30.793
He's working.

01:33.000 --> 01:35.913
- Always working.
- Working where?

(SIGHS) You have no idea
who you're dealing with.

01:42.000 --> 01:44.833
- Is that right?
- Horn's looking for you.

01:45.040 --> 01:48.829
He's got men everywhere
looking for you.

01:49.040 --> 01:50.872
And her.

01:54.000 --> 01:54.876
And Pittman.

01:55.040 --> 01:57.429
And once he finds you...

01:59.760 --> 02:01.159

02:03.360 --> 02:05.317
Of course I do.

02:07.280 --> 02:10.079
That's why I'm gonna find him first.

02:32.520 --> 02:34.397
And, folks,

02:34.560 --> 02:37.359
we now know who
was behind the bombing.

02:37.520 --> 02:42.356
The man who stood amongst us,
and called himself Stu Redman.

02:43.280 --> 02:46.557

02:46.720 --> 02:48.154
You may have heard of him.

02:48.320 --> 02:52.553
General Miles Matheson
of the Monroe Republic.

02:52.720 --> 02:55.951
Now, we have reason to believe
he was acting in retaliation

02:56.120 --> 02:58.794
for the execution
of his former leader,

02:58.960 --> 03:02.954
Sebastian Monroe,
and he didn't act alone.

03:03.160 --> 03:05.754
He had an accomplice.

03:05.920 --> 03:07.911
Aaron Pittman.

03:21.640 --> 03:23.711
Uh, yeah.

03:25.120 --> 03:29.432
Matheson and Pittman pulled
the wool over our eyes,

03:29.640 --> 03:31.870

03:32.040 --> 03:36.273
My daughter also came
to town with them.

03:36.480 --> 03:41.873
She was troubled psychologically.
Some of you know that.

03:43.240 --> 03:46.119
She had nothing to do
with any of this.

03:46.280 --> 03:52.117
She and my granddaughter are victims.
They were manipulated by these men.

report it to a U.S. officer.

a change of plan.

04:24.400 --> 04:28.314
- What change of plan?
- In that this plan has gone to hell.

were waiting for you.

We don't know if Miles

04:34.360 --> 04:37.318
can even get out of town
or if he's still alive.

unless we kill Horn first.

- Yes, sir.

- Where is she?
- Tied up.

got my wife captive.

07:31.920 --> 07:35.231
your wife is an enemy of
the United States of America.

07:35.400 --> 07:39.030
I figured that you
were a good Patriot.

07:39.200 --> 07:41.111
Am I wrong?

07:45.840 --> 07:48.719
She's guilty of sedition.

07:48.880 --> 07:51.076
She should be punished.

07:53.920 --> 07:58.312
- So why not bring her in?
- My guess is that you have

07:58.480 --> 08:03.111

over your head,

08:03.280 --> 08:07.239
over an otherwise spotless career.

08:07.400 --> 08:10.279
I mean, your wife is a traitor.

08:10.440 --> 08:12.829

08:16.560 --> 08:18.915

of it rubbed off on you.

08:20.680 --> 08:25.914
But if you brought your wife in
by yourself,

08:26.080 --> 08:29.232
delivered her unto justice,

08:29.440 --> 08:32.477
that would solve all of
your problems, wouldn't it?

08:32.640 --> 08:35.871
Turn that rain into sunshine.

08:42.799 --> 08:45.633
And why would you do this for me?

08:45.800 --> 08:48.599
Honestly? I'm ambitious.

08:48.760 --> 08:51.559
And I think there's value

08:51.720 --> 08:55.156

Pittman is. I'll find him.

find him any faster.

09:42.680 --> 09:44.353

How about we get
everyone Pittman knows,

and start executing them?

you take the whole continent?

and figure out what makes him tick,

10:13.240 --> 10:16.870
we take everything in months.

10:22.520 --> 10:24.352

11:05.400 --> 11:07.869
I know you're angry,

11:08.040 --> 11:10.793
and I'm not apologizing for him.

11:10.960 --> 11:13.873
But you don't know why
Grandpa did what he did.

11:14.040 --> 11:16.429
He sold us out. He works for them.

11:16.600 --> 11:19.069

11:19.280 --> 11:24.116

- No.

11:24.280 --> 11:27.511
Well, you're a better person than me.

11:27.680 --> 11:29.512
No, I'm not.

11:29.680 --> 11:33.833
I hated you for a long time
for abandoning Danny and me,

11:34.040 --> 11:37.396
for killing Nora.

11:37.560 --> 11:41.554
That's not fair.
This is different.

11:41.760 --> 11:44.798
All I'm saying is hating you
was the easy part.

11:44.960 --> 11:46.439
But letting it go?

11:48.080 --> 11:50.196

cooking with my daughter,

- What are you gonna do?
- Sorry.

41:34.400 --> 41:39.873
I am, but we need to elevate you
to a proper emotional state.

41:40.040 --> 41:44.557
Then, maybe...
maybe you can heal someone else.

41:44.720 --> 41:47.917
No. Please! (PANTING)

41:48.080 --> 41:49.514
You said you weren't gonna hurt her!

41:49.680 --> 41:52.240
I'll check in in a bit.

41:54.960 --> 41:59.431
This room may not be the
safest place to be right now.
