[camera shutter clicking]

00:12.621 --> 00:13.970
[siren whoops]

00:14.014 --> 00:15.232
STAMOS:
Witnesses said the Mercedes

00:15.276 --> 00:17.104
was driving on the wrong side
of the road.

00:17.147 --> 00:18.453
Vic swerved to avoid him.

00:18.496 --> 00:19.541
Where's the driver?

00:19.584 --> 00:20.759
At the ER.

00:20.803 --> 00:21.978
I just got a page

00:22.022 --> 00:23.371
from the hospital.

00:23.414 --> 00:25.242
The other driver's
injuries were minimal.

00:25.286 --> 00:27.636
No-no sign of intoxication.

00:27.679 --> 00:29.899
The deceased was
a civilian accountant at DoD.

00:29.942 --> 00:31.509
Handles Navy payroll.

00:31.553 --> 00:33.729
And it looks like he made
an unauthorized withdrawal.

00:37.124 --> 00:38.908
STAMOS:
What's a Navy accountant doing

00:38.951 --> 00:40.692
with a bag full of cash
and a .45?

00:40.736 --> 00:42.651
MAGNUS:
I cantell you
he appears to be

00:42.694 --> 00:45.088
suffering from something
called LEOPARD syndrome.

00:45.132 --> 00:47.438
Oh, here it comes.It's an acronym

00:47.482 --> 00:49.266
for a rare genetic disease.

00:49.310 --> 00:52.226
Note the unusually large
freckling around the face--

00:52.269 --> 00:53.618
lentigines,

00:53.662 --> 00:56.056
as they're called.
Very, very rare.

00:56.099 --> 00:57.709
We're gonna need a statement
from the other driver.

00:57.753 --> 00:58.884
STAMOS:
I'll bring him in.

00:58.928 --> 01:01.235
Are we charging him?Maybe manslaughter?

01:01.278 --> 01:02.497
He wasn't drunk, but...

01:02.540 --> 01:03.411
he still killed someone.

01:03.454 --> 01:05.065
Or not.

01:05.108 --> 01:06.718
Doc?

01:06.762 --> 01:09.330
I got multiple stab wounds.

01:09.373 --> 01:12.376
Looks like a switchblade,
maybe a small hunting knife.

01:12.420 --> 01:15.771
He was probably bleeding
for hours before the crash.

01:15.814 --> 01:18.513
This man didn't die
from the accident.

01:18.556 --> 01:20.558
He was murdered.

01:20.602 --> 01:23.170
[thumping nearby]

01:23.213 --> 01:25.041
Someone's in the trunk.

01:27.435 --> 01:29.132
[thumping continues]MAN [muffled]:
Hello?

01:29.176 --> 01:30.960
Someone let me out of here!
Hello?

01:35.443 --> 01:36.618
It's okay.

01:36.661 --> 01:38.141
Everything's fine.

01:38.185 --> 01:40.796
What's your name, Marine?

01:40.839 --> 01:43.146
Gibbs, sir.

01:43.190 --> 01:45.975
Sergeant Leroy Jethro Gibbs.

01:47.498 --> 01:49.544
â™ª

02:18.094 --> 02:20.662
[elevator bell dings]

02:20.705 --> 02:22.620
Hope no one has any plans

02:22.664 --> 02:23.752
this weekend.

02:23.795 --> 02:25.319
We are going out.

02:25.362 --> 02:27.234
I have plans
every weekend.Yeah, and I'm

02:27.277 --> 02:29.932
just finishing up the case
for that kidnapping.

02:29.975 --> 02:31.847
Sorry. Attendance is mandatory.

02:31.890 --> 02:33.805
Oh, what's up, man?
I haven't seen you this excited

02:33.849 --> 02:34.937
since, uh...

02:34.980 --> 02:37.200
um... nerd things.

02:37.244 --> 02:38.680
Dude,

02:38.723 --> 02:40.899
it is the 20th anniversary
of the day I decided

02:40.943 --> 02:42.901
to become an NCIS agent.

02:42.945 --> 02:44.686
Oh, okay. That is a big deal.

02:44.729 --> 02:46.296
I'm in, brah.

02:46.340 --> 02:48.037
Wow. Me, too.

02:48.080 --> 02:50.213
Me, three, assuming I'm invited.

02:50.257 --> 02:52.433
Course. No,
but the question is,

02:52.476 --> 02:53.912
do I invite Gibbs?

02:53.956 --> 02:55.827
Ooh, man, is that
a trick question?

02:55.871 --> 02:57.220
No. See, here's the thing.

02:57.264 --> 02:58.656
Obviously,
I want him to come, right?

02:58.700 --> 03:02.094
But every time we ask him
to go anywhere, he says no.

03:02.138 --> 03:04.445
So I've been thinking
maybe if I don'tinvite Gibbs,

03:04.488 --> 03:05.663
you know...

03:05.707 --> 03:06.925
How long have you
been overthinking this?

03:06.969 --> 03:08.840
Counting yesterday?

03:08.884 --> 03:11.930
My advice: if you really want
Gibbs to come, just ask him.

03:11.974 --> 03:13.193
GIBBS:
Ask me what?

03:17.197 --> 03:19.808
Um, well, boss,
I'm taking out some of the team

03:19.851 --> 03:21.331
this weekend, for drinks,

03:21.375 --> 03:22.506
and I was wondering...

03:22.550 --> 03:23.551
Have fun.

03:23.594 --> 03:25.683
[soft laughter]

03:25.727 --> 03:27.207
Grab your gear.

03:27.250 --> 03:28.425
We got a body.

03:28.469 --> 03:30.253
Boss, you sure
you don't want to come?

03:30.297 --> 03:32.690
I'd love to have you.

03:32.734 --> 03:35.127
GIBBS:
Uh, maybe next time.

03:35.171 --> 03:37.260
Just so you know,
it's-it's my anniversary.

03:37.304 --> 03:41.264
McGee, I'm about done
with anniversaries for the year.

03:41.308 --> 03:43.223
BISHOP:
Hey, uh,

03:43.266 --> 03:45.877
so where's the body?In our basement.

03:49.316 --> 03:51.143
JIMMY: If the body's
still warm, it means

03:51.187 --> 03:52.884
he's been here 12 hours or less.

03:52.928 --> 03:55.235
But once Lenny
the Liver Probe

03:55.278 --> 03:58.368
does his magic, I'll be able
to be more specific.

03:58.412 --> 04:00.892
Who is he?Uh, no idea.
We were...

04:00.936 --> 04:02.894
waiting for you
before we looked for a wallet.

04:02.938 --> 04:05.288
Well, an A-plus to you
for following protocol.

04:07.769 --> 04:09.031
[beeps]

04:09.074 --> 04:10.859
Palmer.Yeah?

04:10.902 --> 04:13.078
Wallet.Oh, right, yeah.

04:15.951 --> 04:19.389
All right,
our mystery guest is...

04:19.433 --> 04:21.957
NCIS Special Agent
Ronald Calloway

04:22.000 --> 04:23.567
of the Carolina office.

04:23.611 --> 04:25.177
McGEE:
Must have been part

04:25.221 --> 04:26.875
of that interoffice exchange
last week.

04:26.918 --> 04:29.486
Call Carolina. Let 'em know.Okay.

04:29.530 --> 04:31.575
What do you
think happened?Well, based

04:31.619 --> 04:33.011
on petechial hemorrhaging,
I'd say he

04:33.055 --> 04:34.752
asphyxiated about...

04:34.796 --> 04:35.927
nine hours ago.

04:35.971 --> 04:37.320
How?

04:37.364 --> 04:38.974
I'm not sure.

04:39.017 --> 04:41.542
No signs of strangulation.
Clearly didn't drown.

04:41.585 --> 04:43.195
Looks like he burned
that notebook over there.

04:43.239 --> 04:45.676
Maybe that had something to do
with his death.

04:45.720 --> 04:47.374
It's not likely.

04:47.417 --> 04:48.679
I-I really shouldn't speculate
any further

04:48.723 --> 04:50.246
until we get Agent Calloway here

04:50.290 --> 04:51.334
into autopsy.Thanks.

04:51.378 --> 04:53.118
Whoever he really is,

04:53.162 --> 04:55.730
that was SAC at Carolina--
there is

04:55.773 --> 04:57.340
no Special Agent Calloway
at their office

04:57.384 --> 04:59.211
or at any NCIS office.

04:59.255 --> 05:00.952
The credentials are fake.

05:00.996 --> 05:02.519
Run his prints.

05:02.563 --> 05:03.912
JIMMY:
That's gonna be tough.

05:05.435 --> 05:07.089
His fingerprints
have been burned off.

05:11.398 --> 05:13.313
What was this guy doing
down here?

05:22.365 --> 05:24.019
McGEE:
So, Torres said
the security sweeps

05:24.062 --> 05:26.021
are almost done--
no sign of any bombs.

05:26.064 --> 05:27.544
You check the roof?

05:27.588 --> 05:29.807
Yeah, and everyone in the
building's been accounted for.

05:29.851 --> 05:31.461
We're pretty sure
he was alone.

05:31.505 --> 05:33.071
All right, I think
we need to put a pin

05:33.115 --> 05:34.290
in this evacuation
for now.

05:34.334 --> 05:36.205
But as soon as
you find out

05:36.248 --> 05:39.556
who that man was,
I want to know.You heard him.

05:39.600 --> 05:41.645
All right. Well,
we don't have any I.D., but...

05:41.689 --> 05:42.907
According to the sign-in log,

05:42.951 --> 05:44.822
the intruder entered
the building last night.

05:44.866 --> 05:47.390
McGEE:
Wandered around
for a little bit...

05:47.434 --> 05:49.436
BISHOP:
Then he went
into the subbasement.

05:49.479 --> 05:51.525
Why'd he do that?Well, I have a theory.

05:51.568 --> 05:53.875
I think he might have been
trying to hack into our network.

05:53.918 --> 05:55.398
See, his body was found

05:55.442 --> 05:57.357
next to the main
interconnect hub.

05:57.400 --> 05:59.794
That's what connects up
every NCIS office in the world.

05:59.837 --> 06:01.317
What was he after?

06:01.361 --> 06:03.363
No clue. I mean,
the only thing we found on him

06:03.406 --> 06:06.148
besides his I.D. was
that notebook.And he burned it.

06:06.191 --> 06:08.846
I guess he didn't want us
to see what was inside.But obviously,

06:08.890 --> 06:10.761
somebody's targeting us.

06:10.805 --> 06:12.850
Find out who.

06:12.894 --> 06:14.591
[whispers]:
Hey.
Hmm?

06:14.635 --> 06:16.767
So, I did find
something out.

06:16.811 --> 06:18.552
Why didn't you tell Gibbs?

06:18.595 --> 06:20.075
Because it's about Gibbs.

06:21.381 --> 06:23.426
I think I know what
he was talking about

06:23.470 --> 06:25.036
when he said he was done
with anniversaries.

06:25.080 --> 06:27.343
Yeah, that was weird, huh?

06:27.387 --> 06:29.824
I didn't realize, last week
it was his and Shannon's

06:29.867 --> 06:31.129
wedding anniversary.

06:31.173 --> 06:33.958
Oh. Yeah.

06:34.002 --> 06:36.004
That's tough.I know.

06:36.047 --> 06:37.571
For him to even mention it...

06:37.614 --> 06:39.573
I know.Well,

06:39.616 --> 06:41.226
then we really should try
to get him to come out

06:41.270 --> 06:43.011
for drinks with us.I agree.

06:43.054 --> 06:44.969
What we need is a ringer.

06:45.013 --> 06:46.231
Someone with
sweet little doe eyes

06:46.275 --> 06:48.451
that Gibbs
can't say no to.

06:48.495 --> 06:50.235
JIMMY:
You want me to do what?

06:50.279 --> 06:52.499
Oh, come on, McGee.
The guy never comes out

06:52.542 --> 06:54.675
for drinks with us. And...

06:56.372 --> 06:58.200
Oh, that is so sad.

06:58.243 --> 07:00.071
Yeah, of course.
No, I mean, I'll try.

07:00.115 --> 07:02.552
It's just, getting Gibbs to
commit to a social engagement's

07:02.596 --> 07:05.381
like trying to find Waldo
blindfolded.

07:05.425 --> 07:07.992
How could you not know
who Waldo is?

07:08.036 --> 07:09.472
GIBBS:
Who's Waldo?

07:09.516 --> 07:11.953
Uh, actually,
it's Where's Waldo?

07:11.996 --> 07:14.085
Okay. Where is Waldo?

07:14.129 --> 07:15.739
[chuckles]

07:15.783 --> 07:17.872
Maybe I should just tell you
how our victim died.

07:17.915 --> 07:20.004
It was a severe asthma attack.

07:20.048 --> 07:23.312
I extracted these mucus plugs
from his airways.

07:23.355 --> 07:26.097
It's a hallmark sign of
an asthmatic asphyxiation.

07:26.141 --> 07:30.319
Also, based on the tox screen
that Kasie sent down,

07:30.362 --> 07:32.930
I'm fairly confident the attack
was triggered by mold spores

07:32.974 --> 07:35.063
from his basement,
so, Gibbs,

07:35.106 --> 07:36.543
his death was a fluke.

07:36.586 --> 07:38.283
And you should totally come out
for drinks with us

07:38.327 --> 07:39.807
on Sunday.

07:39.850 --> 07:41.591
My, that was smooth.

07:41.635 --> 07:43.767
Segues aren't my strong suit.
[chuckles]

07:43.811 --> 07:45.595
But I really think that
you would like...

07:45.639 --> 07:47.118
Hearing more about
how this guy died.

07:47.162 --> 07:48.903
Yeah, that makes sense.
Uh, Gibbs,

07:48.946 --> 07:51.209
the thing is,
this man shouldn't have died.

07:51.253 --> 07:54.691
With asthma this bad, I'm sure
he was prescribed an inhaler

07:54.735 --> 07:57.651
at some point; I'm just not sure
why he wasn't carrying it.

07:57.694 --> 08:00.567
Because it could help I.D. him
if he was caught.

08:00.610 --> 08:02.525
Guess anyone who burns off
their fingerprints

08:02.569 --> 08:04.309
doesn't want to be identified.

08:04.353 --> 08:08.139
But... Kasie got a hit
on his DNA anyway.

08:08.183 --> 08:11.578
So, our bad guy's name is...

08:11.621 --> 08:12.796
Zucado.

08:12.840 --> 08:15.886
Maurice Zucado.

08:15.930 --> 08:18.454
I can see why he didn't want
to be identified.

08:18.498 --> 08:20.064
Gibbs, he's not
just a bad guy.

08:20.108 --> 08:21.065
He is a really bad guy.

08:21.109 --> 08:23.459
In fact, he comes from...

08:23.503 --> 08:25.896
A whole family of bad guys.

08:25.940 --> 08:28.290
Wait. You know him?

08:28.333 --> 08:31.467
I had a run-in with his cousin.

08:31.511 --> 08:33.643
Years ago.

08:35.166 --> 08:37.125
[phone ringing]SCOTT: Gibbs?

08:37.168 --> 08:39.562
That's with two B's, right?Yes, sir.

08:39.606 --> 08:42.913
Well, you're lucky to be alive,
Gibbs With Two B's.

08:42.957 --> 08:44.567
Any idea who threw you
in that trunk?

08:44.611 --> 08:47.570
He didn't exactly
introduce himself.

08:47.614 --> 08:51.531
His real name was
Rinaldi Zucado.

08:51.574 --> 08:54.534
Goes by Ringo.
Sound familiar?

08:54.577 --> 08:57.493
No.The Zucados are a class act.

08:57.537 --> 08:59.974
Four cousins who never met a law
they wouldn't break.

09:00.017 --> 09:02.585
B&E, assault, murder.

09:02.629 --> 09:05.893
Used to be five.
We think the other four ate him.

09:05.936 --> 09:08.025
Uh-huh.

09:09.200 --> 09:11.246
Looks like Ringo
used an alias

09:11.289 --> 09:14.205
to get an accounting job
at DoD.

09:14.249 --> 09:16.599
Then gave himself a bonus.

09:16.643 --> 09:18.079
You sure you don't know
anything about it?

09:18.122 --> 09:19.341
I'm sure.

09:20.690 --> 09:21.561
How about this?

09:22.823 --> 09:24.520
GIBBS:
Maybe a... a key?

09:24.564 --> 09:26.087
Thinking hotel.

09:26.130 --> 09:27.741
Yeah, but we can't
find the hotel.

09:27.784 --> 09:29.873
Hoping you can
give us a lead.

09:29.917 --> 09:31.962
Maybe start with
how you ended up

09:32.006 --> 09:33.921
in a trunk in D.C. when
your file says you're stationed

09:33.964 --> 09:35.183
at Lejeune.

09:35.226 --> 09:37.664
No, sir, not anymore.

09:37.707 --> 09:40.188
I was just accepted to
scout sniper school.

09:40.231 --> 09:42.190
Then you took a wrong turn.

09:42.233 --> 09:44.540
This year's scouts report
to Pendleton.

09:44.584 --> 09:45.715
So why are you in D.C.?

09:45.759 --> 09:47.238
Pit stop.

09:47.282 --> 09:48.631
We're here for
a buddy's wedding.

09:48.675 --> 09:50.024
"We"?

09:50.067 --> 09:52.374
My girlfriend, Shannon.

09:52.417 --> 09:54.376
She gets here
in a few days.

09:54.419 --> 09:56.596
I'm here early because
I'm in the wedding.

09:56.639 --> 09:59.076
I was out looking
for a suit

09:59.120 --> 10:02.645
when this guy runs up behind me
and sticks a gun in my ear.

10:02.689 --> 10:04.560
Forced me into the trunk,
took off driving.

10:04.604 --> 10:06.475
He forced you,Marine?

10:06.518 --> 10:09.434
There were civilians around.

10:09.478 --> 10:10.784
Didn't want to risk it.

10:10.827 --> 10:12.612
Noble.

10:12.655 --> 10:14.048
But a gamble.

10:14.091 --> 10:15.397
If it wasn't for
that idiot driving

10:15.440 --> 10:17.007
on the wrong side
of the road,

10:17.051 --> 10:18.530
you might be the one
in our morgue.

10:18.574 --> 10:19.706
[elevator bell dings]

10:19.749 --> 10:21.838
And now you got a chance
to say thank you.

10:21.882 --> 10:24.275
Looks like he's back
from the hospital to
give his statement.

10:24.319 --> 10:25.973
I'm just saying,
if Americans want to drive

10:26.016 --> 10:27.844
on the wrong side of the road,
they should put up bloody signs

10:27.888 --> 10:29.585
at every intersection

10:29.629 --> 10:31.674
to remind the rest
of the civilized world.

10:31.718 --> 10:32.936
Mr. Mallard.

10:32.980 --> 10:34.851
Actually, Dr. Mallard.

10:34.895 --> 10:36.766
Well, former doctor.

10:36.810 --> 10:38.594
Sergeant Gibbs.

10:38.638 --> 10:39.813
Former trunk.

10:39.856 --> 10:41.162
Ah.

10:41.205 --> 10:43.120
I owe you a drink.

10:43.164 --> 10:45.470
Well, that depends.

10:45.514 --> 10:47.472
How do you feel about scotch?

10:47.516 --> 10:49.997
I'd feel better about bourbon.

10:50.040 --> 10:51.259
Sold.

10:54.001 --> 10:55.829
[laughing]

10:55.872 --> 10:59.093
Yes, well,
that would be fantastic.

10:59.136 --> 11:02.705
Ah, just the man
I wanted to see.

11:02.749 --> 11:04.925
Yes, I had a wonderfully
productive lunch yesterday

11:04.968 --> 11:08.537
with the historians
from the DEA and CIA.

11:08.580 --> 11:10.713
And we had this...Zucados are back.

11:10.757 --> 11:12.193
I beg your pardon?

11:12.236 --> 11:14.151
You heard me, Duck.

11:14.195 --> 11:16.719
Well, how do you know?Because

11:16.763 --> 11:20.462
one of them is laying downstairs
in our morgue.

11:21.985 --> 11:24.814
I believe the apropos phrase is

11:24.858 --> 11:26.511
"just when we thought
we were out..."

11:36.130 --> 11:38.567
So, is Gibbs a yes or a
no for drinks on Sunday?

11:38.610 --> 11:39.786
No, unfortunately,
it was a bust.

11:39.829 --> 11:41.613
Jimmy had a good idea, though.

11:41.657 --> 11:43.006
He thinks that
we should fake

11:43.050 --> 11:44.399
a crime scene, right?

11:44.442 --> 11:46.096
Trick Gibbs...[clears throat]
McGee.

11:46.140 --> 11:48.229
Come on, let's go.Oh. Okay.

11:48.272 --> 11:50.231
Well, as you know,
our intruder's

11:50.274 --> 11:52.755
real name was Maurice Zucado.TORRES:
He's been in and out

11:52.799 --> 11:54.191
of jail his whole life.

11:54.235 --> 11:57.368
But one of his crimes
seems particularly relevant now,

11:57.412 --> 11:59.022
especially if we're
going with a hacker theory.

11:59.066 --> 12:00.807
BISHOP:
About four years ago, Maurice

12:00.850 --> 12:03.026
got a job at a phone
company and was arrested

12:03.070 --> 12:05.246
six months later
for breaking into their system.

12:05.289 --> 12:06.813
So he definitely has
hacker skills.

12:06.856 --> 12:08.292
What was he looking for?

12:08.336 --> 12:10.773
I'm sure Zucado knows.

12:10.817 --> 12:12.819
What's that?

12:12.862 --> 12:14.516
Jonny Zucado.

12:14.559 --> 12:17.432
Who's Jonny Zucado?

12:17.475 --> 12:18.650
His cousin.

12:18.694 --> 12:20.696
Jonny was in charge of the crew.

12:20.740 --> 12:23.090
If there's a Zucado
breaking the law,

12:23.133 --> 12:25.266
Jonny's involved.

12:25.309 --> 12:27.877
Find him.

12:27.921 --> 12:30.314
Okay.Hey, Gibbs, so,
there's this new bar

12:30.358 --> 12:32.055
down by Lakewood,
and, uh, they have bourbon

12:32.099 --> 12:34.057
that's smooth...Jonny Zucado.

12:34.101 --> 12:36.494
Get me something.Sir.

12:36.538 --> 12:38.322
Boss, I got something.

12:38.366 --> 12:39.802
It's a construction company

12:39.846 --> 12:40.803
that's under investigation

12:40.847 --> 12:41.891
by the Carolinas
Field Office

12:41.935 --> 12:42.936
on bribery

12:42.979 --> 12:44.328
and obstruction of justice
charges.

12:44.372 --> 12:46.635
Well, this Zucado guy

12:46.678 --> 12:48.724
easily could have sent
his cousin to hack

12:48.768 --> 12:50.726
into our system,
see how much we know.

12:50.770 --> 12:51.945
Bring him in.

12:51.988 --> 12:53.598
Jonny went into hiding

12:53.642 --> 12:55.296
the day Carolina
filed charges against him.

12:55.339 --> 12:56.558
He's gonna be tough to find.

12:57.515 --> 12:59.561
You got a problem with tough?

12:59.604 --> 13:01.781
[chuckles]:
Well, no, boss, but...

13:01.824 --> 13:03.173
But I do have a question.

13:04.566 --> 13:06.873
How'd you know...

13:06.916 --> 13:08.788
to even look for this guy?

13:14.968 --> 13:17.187
DUCKY:
Sorry I'm late.

13:17.231 --> 13:19.886
I finally found a rental home
for Mother and me.

13:19.929 --> 13:22.192
This one's furnished.
I just signed the lease.

13:22.236 --> 13:25.892
So, the boat's
stuck in the bottle,

13:25.935 --> 13:28.633
and you can never get it out.
What's the point?

13:28.677 --> 13:30.853
It's a beastly little Victorian
Mother will hate

13:30.897 --> 13:32.855
but you would probably love.
There's a basement perfect...

13:32.899 --> 13:35.597
Oh, walk and talk. I'm thirsty.Oh.

13:35.640 --> 13:37.817
Yeah. When you said
you wanted to buy me a drink,

13:37.860 --> 13:39.340
I didn't realize
we'd spend the next three days

13:39.383 --> 13:40.732
hitting every pub
in the city.

13:40.776 --> 13:42.343
Well, I have to say,
getting to know you

13:42.386 --> 13:45.346
has been a fascinating
case study in fortitude

13:45.389 --> 13:46.782
and mettle.[chuckles]

13:46.826 --> 13:49.437
U.S. Marine Corps
must be proud to have you.

13:49.480 --> 13:52.135
Feeling's mutual.[chuckles]

13:52.179 --> 13:54.529
Succinctly put. You're a man
of few words, aren't you?

13:54.572 --> 13:57.314
Well, you do
all the talking.Well,

13:57.358 --> 14:00.578
let's talk about this wedding
suit you've been lugging around.

14:00.622 --> 14:02.102
Can I take a peek?

14:07.890 --> 14:09.022
What do you think?

14:10.545 --> 14:12.634
I think you are
about to find out

14:12.677 --> 14:15.419
just how much this girlfriend
of yours actually loves you.

14:15.463 --> 14:18.205
Speaking of, when
do you pick her up?

14:18.248 --> 14:20.468
Her bus gets in from
Stillwater today, does it not?

14:20.511 --> 14:22.470
Her bus does.

14:22.513 --> 14:24.515
She doesn't.

14:24.559 --> 14:26.735
Why? What happened?

14:28.606 --> 14:31.696
Oh, my. Ah.
[chuckles]

14:31.740 --> 14:34.264
That explains
the day drinking.

14:34.308 --> 14:36.571
What's my excuse?

14:36.614 --> 14:39.530
Jethro, I'm so very sorry.
Did she give you a reason?

14:39.574 --> 14:41.576
She didn't end it. I did.

14:41.619 --> 14:44.927
W-Wait, wait, wait, wait.
I don't understand.

14:44.971 --> 14:46.755
This is the girl
you called your soul mate,

14:46.798 --> 14:48.148
and suddenly, you decide you...

14:49.889 --> 14:52.369
You didn't break up with her
over the phone, did you?

14:52.413 --> 14:54.937
Would you prefer
I let her get on a bus

14:54.981 --> 14:56.330
and come all the way down here?

14:56.373 --> 14:58.854
A proper gentleman
would have gone to her.

15:02.771 --> 15:05.295
I'm buying the drinks today.

15:05.339 --> 15:08.342
Nobody's drinking today.

15:08.385 --> 15:11.693
Jonny Zucado
wants to talk to you.

15:11.736 --> 15:14.304
He's not related to a Ringo
by any chance?

15:15.305 --> 15:16.916
Now.

15:16.959 --> 15:18.526
Maurice, get the car.

15:18.569 --> 15:20.441
[inhales]

15:20.484 --> 15:22.530
[elevator bell dings]

15:24.010 --> 15:26.403
After talking with Ducky,
I think we figured out

15:26.447 --> 15:28.710
a way we can track this
Jonny Zucado guy.

15:28.753 --> 15:30.233
Now, Jonny may have
gone into hiding

15:30.277 --> 15:31.843
to avoid the charges
against him,

15:31.887 --> 15:33.671
but his pacemaker did not.

15:33.715 --> 15:35.891
Zucado was implanted

15:35.935 --> 15:37.849
with one exactly like this

15:37.893 --> 15:40.591
when he was treated for
atrial fibrillation last year.

15:40.635 --> 15:42.115
Can you track it, Kasie?

15:42.158 --> 15:45.640
Well, sort of.
Every day, it phones home

15:45.683 --> 15:48.077
to Zucado's doctor
on a cellular frequency.

15:48.121 --> 15:50.688
Now, the next time the pacemaker
connects, I should be able

15:50.732 --> 15:52.952
to triangulate his location
off the cell tower.

15:54.170 --> 15:56.825
Now, Jonny Zucado,

15:56.868 --> 15:59.175
he can run from the long arm
of the law, but he cannot hide

15:59.219 --> 16:02.222
from the medium-sized arms
of Kasie Hines.

16:03.614 --> 16:05.181
Oh, Jethro.

16:05.225 --> 16:09.142
Did you ever think
you'd see that face again?

16:09.185 --> 16:12.058
Well, I was hoping not.KASIE:
After I heard

16:12.101 --> 16:14.016
about the run-in
you two had back in the day

16:14.060 --> 16:15.887
with this Zucado guy,

16:15.931 --> 16:18.629
I looked up
your old NIS case file.

16:22.503 --> 16:23.852
What did I do?

16:23.895 --> 16:25.419
It's not you.

16:25.462 --> 16:27.290
It's him.

16:27.334 --> 16:30.598
Jonny Zucado
was the one that got away.

16:30.641 --> 16:33.035
And it seems
that his reappearance

16:33.079 --> 16:36.560
is dredging up old memories
that are...

16:36.604 --> 16:40.129
better left unremembered.

16:40.173 --> 16:42.349
[grunts]

16:42.392 --> 16:44.742
Let's try this again.

16:44.786 --> 16:48.137
What did my cousin Ringo say
before he died?

16:48.181 --> 16:49.834
[siren wailing in distance]

16:49.878 --> 16:52.924
The only Ringo I know is the one
who wrote "Octopus's Garden."

16:52.968 --> 16:54.448
[chuckles softly]

16:56.798 --> 16:58.669
[grunts]

17:01.281 --> 17:03.544
[spits]

17:04.588 --> 17:06.416
Give me the thing from Freckles.

17:11.291 --> 17:13.380
"I was out

17:13.423 --> 17:16.252
"looking for a suit
when a guy ran up

17:16.296 --> 17:18.820
behind me and stuck a gun
in my ear." That sound familiar?

17:18.863 --> 17:21.083
Because that's what
you told that cop.

17:22.302 --> 17:25.870
Is there anything else
not in the report?

17:28.395 --> 17:30.440
My cousin Ringo

17:30.484 --> 17:32.747
stole something from me.

17:32.790 --> 17:36.055
Something very,
very valuable.

17:36.098 --> 17:37.578
And I need to know

17:37.621 --> 17:39.884
if he told those NIS cops
about it.

17:41.147 --> 17:43.323
You have the report.

17:43.366 --> 17:45.499
You need me to
read it to you?

17:53.333 --> 17:56.162
Wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

17:56.205 --> 17:58.120
Your cousin died
shortly after the car crash

17:58.164 --> 17:59.774
from multiple stab wounds.

17:59.817 --> 18:01.297
I attempted to
save his life,

18:01.341 --> 18:02.907
but he'd lost too much blood
from those stab wounds.

18:02.951 --> 18:04.866
Yeah.
That was kind of the point.

18:06.172 --> 18:07.912
The thing is
he didn't have a chance

18:07.956 --> 18:09.784
to tell
those NIS agents anything.

18:09.827 --> 18:11.916
He was dead
long before they arrived.

18:13.570 --> 18:15.355
I'm telling the truth.

18:17.400 --> 18:18.749
Okay.

18:20.055 --> 18:21.448
I believe you.

18:21.491 --> 18:24.233
And thank you so much
for that information.

18:24.277 --> 18:25.930
We're done here.

18:25.974 --> 18:27.149
[gun clicks]

18:29.543 --> 18:31.893
You kill us,

18:31.936 --> 18:34.809
they will never stop
looking for you.

18:34.852 --> 18:37.159
Won't be the cops
that find you.

18:37.203 --> 18:40.728
It will be the Marines.

18:45.950 --> 18:47.691
[gun clicks]KASIE: Damn.

18:47.735 --> 18:49.867
Semper Fi.

18:49.911 --> 18:52.174
Baby Gibbs played
that one right.

18:52.218 --> 18:55.221
Zucado let us live,
but with a warning.

18:55.264 --> 18:58.659
He said if we told anyone
about what had happened,

18:58.702 --> 19:01.618
well, we'd regret it.

19:01.662 --> 19:04.317
But you told NIS anyway. Right?

19:04.360 --> 19:06.362
Wrong.

19:06.406 --> 19:10.018
Gibbs wanted to, but I tried
to persuade him otherwise.

19:10.061 --> 19:11.237
[computer chimes]

19:11.280 --> 19:13.935
Oh, I got something.

19:13.978 --> 19:15.763
We just got a ping
on his location,

19:15.806 --> 19:18.244
but not from his pacemaker.

19:18.287 --> 19:20.333
From his regular cell phone.

19:20.376 --> 19:22.204
He just turned it on.

19:22.248 --> 19:23.640
We found him.

19:27.775 --> 19:29.907
Hey.
Hey.

19:33.563 --> 19:37.219
So this is the guy that broke
both of Gibbs's arms.Hmm?

19:37.263 --> 19:40.048
I heard from the motor pool
it was both his legs.

19:40.091 --> 19:42.616
Well, apparently even adults
can play telephone.

19:42.659 --> 19:46.620
Either way, I would not
miss this for the world.

19:46.663 --> 19:50.450
Mm-mm. Payback is a bitch.

19:57.761 --> 19:58.980
You got old.

20:01.287 --> 20:03.767
Try wiser. Sit down.

20:08.642 --> 20:11.993
I have to say, this, uh,
police harassment thing

20:12.036 --> 20:14.213
surprised me.

20:14.256 --> 20:17.825
I didn't take you for the kind
of guy who held grudges.

20:26.312 --> 20:28.444
So, why am I here?

20:28.488 --> 20:32.622
We caught your cousin trying
to hack our computer system.

20:32.666 --> 20:35.277
So what's that got
to do with me?

20:35.321 --> 20:39.803
You bribed a government official
to land a construction contract.

20:39.847 --> 20:41.849
Allegedly.

20:41.892 --> 20:44.678
You're not gonna win in court.

20:44.721 --> 20:47.202
You are going away
for a long time.

20:47.246 --> 20:50.771
Oh, I see.

20:50.814 --> 20:53.687
You think I sent my cousin in
to steal your files,

20:53.730 --> 20:55.471
hoping I'd have
an advantage at trial.

20:55.515 --> 20:58.082
Yeah, that's right.[laughs]

20:58.126 --> 21:00.389
Well, I wish I'd thought
of that.

21:00.433 --> 21:04.480
Would have been a lot less risky
than what I did instead.

21:06.308 --> 21:09.006
You got no right to hold me.

21:09.050 --> 21:10.747
I've got an arrest warrant.

21:10.791 --> 21:13.272
Right. For the bribery charges.

21:13.315 --> 21:17.232
Well... except I'd, uh, update
my files if I were you.

21:17.276 --> 21:18.538
[knock on door]

21:18.581 --> 21:20.409
Uh-oh, that can't be good.

21:22.019 --> 21:24.718
Boss, I know about Rule 22.
I'm sorry, but...

21:24.761 --> 21:25.980
Oh, just tell him.

21:26.023 --> 21:27.851
What, McGee?

21:27.895 --> 21:30.245
The bribery charges
against me have been dropped.

21:32.073 --> 21:34.815
An hour ago.
Carolina just confirmed it.

21:34.858 --> 21:37.078
You couldn't get me
40 years ago...

21:39.123 --> 21:41.952
...and you ain't gonna
get me now.

21:46.000 --> 21:48.176
Reunions are fun, aren't they?

21:59.056 --> 22:01.494
Yeah, well, we were caught
off guard as well

22:01.537 --> 22:04.235
when we heard that
Zucado's case was dismissed.

22:04.279 --> 22:05.759
All right, Lynne, thank you.

22:05.802 --> 22:07.543
Give my regards to Makenna.

22:07.587 --> 22:09.415
Zucado buying judges now?

22:09.458 --> 22:11.678
Judge had no choice.

22:11.721 --> 22:13.506
The star witness in the trial
just turned up dead.

22:13.549 --> 22:15.899
There's no case without him.I want that body.

22:15.943 --> 22:17.640
Why?

22:17.684 --> 22:20.861
Because you know
as well as I do

22:20.904 --> 22:23.167
Zucado killed him.Well, that may be, but...

22:23.211 --> 22:24.517
It's why he came out
of hiding, Leon.

22:24.560 --> 22:26.954
He knew that witness was dead.

22:26.997 --> 22:28.956
There's only one way
he could know about that.

22:28.999 --> 22:30.914
It's not our case.

22:30.958 --> 22:32.133
The bribery occurred
on Carolina's turf.

22:32.176 --> 22:34.091
Bribery?

22:34.135 --> 22:36.180
Hell, we get him on murder.
He admitted it.

22:36.224 --> 22:38.357
It's not our case.It is,

22:38.400 --> 22:39.880
Leon.

22:39.923 --> 22:42.143
Zucado's cousin broke
into our office,

22:42.186 --> 22:45.364
trying to hack their way
into the Carolina NCIS network.

22:45.407 --> 22:47.714
That makes it our case.

22:49.759 --> 22:51.457
All right.

22:51.500 --> 22:53.720
I will call Carolina back and
see if they'll send us the body.

22:54.982 --> 22:56.853
But I want something, too,
Gibbs.

23:01.510 --> 23:03.207
I want you to chill out.

23:03.251 --> 23:05.079
Ever since

23:05.122 --> 23:06.341
the name Zucado popped back up,

23:06.385 --> 23:07.516
you've been off your game.

23:07.560 --> 23:10.171
I tried to talk
to Dr. Mallard,

23:10.214 --> 23:12.173
but for the first time
since D-Day,

23:12.216 --> 23:13.609
he hasn't had anything to say.

23:15.089 --> 23:17.483
Something going on
between you two?

23:19.746 --> 23:21.095
Why are we going
through your back door?

23:21.138 --> 23:22.792
Because they might
be watching us.

23:24.011 --> 23:25.186
Where's your phone?

23:25.229 --> 23:27.231
Through there.

23:30.191 --> 23:31.148
Nice wainscoting.

23:31.192 --> 23:32.585
"Wainscoting"?

23:32.628 --> 23:34.195
What kind of Marine are you?

23:34.238 --> 23:35.326
And who are you phoning?

23:35.370 --> 23:36.589
Agent Scott at NIS.

23:36.632 --> 23:38.068
Not a good idea.

23:38.112 --> 23:39.809
Why not?

23:39.853 --> 23:40.810
Because that psychopath
has copies

23:40.854 --> 23:42.072
of the statements we gave them.

23:43.813 --> 23:45.336
Zucado has a mole
in the building.

23:45.380 --> 23:47.426
And if you call Agent Scott
and tell him what happened,

23:47.469 --> 23:48.905
Zucado could find out.

23:48.949 --> 23:49.906
[hangs up receiver]

23:49.950 --> 23:51.212
Hell, for all we know,

23:51.255 --> 23:52.169
Scott could be the mole.

23:52.213 --> 23:53.736
If we're smart...

23:53.780 --> 23:54.911
We find out
who the mole is

23:54.955 --> 23:56.043
before we
go to NIS.

23:56.086 --> 23:57.958
Not what I was going to say.

23:58.001 --> 23:59.350
We could do it.No, we can't, Jethro.

23:59.394 --> 24:00.743
We're not agents.

24:00.787 --> 24:02.615
Then we go after Zucado
ourselves.

24:02.658 --> 24:04.181
Are you trying
to get us killed, man?

24:05.835 --> 24:07.750
Oh. I know what it is.

24:07.794 --> 24:09.448
What?

24:09.491 --> 24:10.840
You haven't been yourself

24:10.884 --> 24:13.016
since you ended things
with your girlfriend.

24:13.060 --> 24:15.497
Haven't been myself?

24:15.541 --> 24:17.151
Any twonk off
the street can see

24:17.194 --> 24:19.501
that you've been moping
around like a lovesick teen.

24:19.545 --> 24:22.156
Not to mention
oozing with guilt.

24:22.199 --> 24:24.332
For what?Don't you think

24:24.375 --> 24:26.552
your girl deserves
a proper explanation

24:26.595 --> 24:28.510
for why you ended
things so abruptly?

24:28.554 --> 24:29.555
I gave her an explanation.

24:29.598 --> 24:31.513
No, you gave
her an excuse.

24:31.557 --> 24:34.081
Sniper school is
on the other side of the country

24:34.124 --> 24:36.692
and a long-distance relationship
would be too tough.

24:36.736 --> 24:37.998
It would.

24:38.041 --> 24:40.522
You got a problem with tough,
Sergeant?

24:42.872 --> 24:45.135
'Cause it seems to me
that you're running.

24:45.179 --> 24:48.443
Says the guy who moved across
an ocean to become an ex-doctor.

24:48.487 --> 24:51.533
This isn't about me.

24:51.577 --> 24:54.275
It's about why the guy
who was so afraid of a girl

24:54.318 --> 24:57.931
is so willing to risk his life
chasing a killer.

24:57.974 --> 25:00.499
Trying to find
some stupid NIS mole

25:00.542 --> 25:01.804
when it could be any...

25:05.242 --> 25:06.548
What?

25:06.592 --> 25:08.811
I know who the mole is.

25:11.335 --> 25:13.207
[sizzling]

25:13.250 --> 25:16.384
Hope you don't mind
that I let myself in,

25:16.427 --> 25:20.344
but there's only so many times
a man will knock

25:20.388 --> 25:22.477
before he tries the door.

25:22.521 --> 25:25.262
That's actually

25:25.306 --> 25:28.135
an old Mallard
family proverb.

25:28.178 --> 25:28.962
[chuckles]

25:30.572 --> 25:32.574
Fine.

25:32.618 --> 25:34.750
Let's cut the small talk.

25:36.622 --> 25:38.928
I'm worried
about you, Jethro.

25:41.061 --> 25:42.453
I'm fine.

25:42.497 --> 25:44.064
No, you are not fine.

25:44.107 --> 25:45.500
You should go

25:45.544 --> 25:47.546
and talk to
Agent Sloane.

25:47.589 --> 25:49.896
Oh, yeah? 'Bout what?

25:49.939 --> 25:52.638
You're letting
a 40-year-old grudge

25:52.681 --> 25:54.248
get under your skin.

25:54.291 --> 25:55.989
That what I'm doing?

25:56.032 --> 25:58.208
Well, have you considered
letting McGee

25:58.252 --> 26:01.342
take point
on the Zucado case?

26:01.385 --> 26:02.865
I'm not walking away from this.

26:02.909 --> 26:04.475
[chuckling]:
Jethro...
Doc,

26:04.519 --> 26:06.216
I took your advice before.

26:06.260 --> 26:08.001
I didn't go
after Zucado.

26:08.044 --> 26:10.133
I'm not backing down again.

26:10.177 --> 26:12.788
[chuckles] Well, if you
had gone after Zucado

26:12.832 --> 26:15.661
40 years ago,
you'd be dead.

26:17.532 --> 26:18.707
Yeah.

26:18.751 --> 26:20.448
I would be.

26:20.491 --> 26:23.582
Is that the way
you want history to unfold?

26:23.625 --> 26:25.192
You'd never have married
Shannon,

26:25.235 --> 26:27.063
never had Kelly, you'd never...

26:30.850 --> 26:32.547
You'd never have lost them.

26:34.288 --> 26:36.638
[sighs] I see.

26:36.682 --> 26:39.685
Your grudge
isn't with Zucado.

26:42.209 --> 26:44.211
It's with me.

26:45.212 --> 26:46.256
No.

26:48.084 --> 26:51.479
They're the best thing that
ever happened to me, you know?

26:51.522 --> 26:53.437
Shannon and Kelly.

26:53.481 --> 26:55.091
I don't blame you.

26:57.311 --> 26:58.878
I owe you.

27:00.183 --> 27:01.968
You gave me
time with them.

27:04.579 --> 27:06.712
Time's all we have.

27:06.755 --> 27:09.149
Indeed it is.

27:09.192 --> 27:13.588
But Shannon and Kelly aren't
your only family.

27:13.632 --> 27:15.155
[phone vibrates]

27:17.548 --> 27:19.986
Carolina has sent over
the dead witness

27:20.029 --> 27:22.728
from the Zucado
bribery case.

27:22.771 --> 27:25.078
I think I'll go

27:25.121 --> 27:27.907
and see if
Dr. Palmer needs any help.

27:31.475 --> 27:33.260
JIMMY:
The deceased is
a 50-year-old male,

27:33.303 --> 27:34.478
whose cause of death

27:34.522 --> 27:35.871
has previously
been determined to be...

27:35.915 --> 27:38.569
Blunt force trauma
to the cranium.

27:38.613 --> 27:40.571
Not bad from 12 feet away.

27:40.615 --> 27:42.617
I've had practice.

27:42.661 --> 27:46.142
And I read
the Carolina M.E.'s report.

27:46.186 --> 27:49.624
I thought perhaps
you might need some assistance.

27:49.668 --> 27:52.018
Mi autopsia es su autopsia.

27:52.061 --> 27:55.369
Have you found anything
to tie this witness's murder

27:55.412 --> 27:57.327
to Jonny Zucado?Not yet.

27:57.371 --> 27:59.242
I am curious
about one thing, though.

27:59.286 --> 28:00.504
What's that?

28:00.548 --> 28:01.854
How long
we're gonna pretend

28:01.897 --> 28:03.377
that you're down here to assist
in an autopsy

28:03.420 --> 28:04.726
when you have yet
to take off your jacket,

28:04.770 --> 28:06.815
much less scrub in.

28:06.859 --> 28:08.861
That's embarrassing.

28:08.904 --> 28:10.340
I won't tell anyone.

28:10.384 --> 28:11.515
He's dead.

28:11.559 --> 28:12.908
Pretty sure you're safe.

28:12.952 --> 28:15.824
My patients were
not always dead.

28:17.173 --> 28:19.045
I used to save lives.

28:19.088 --> 28:22.004
But after all the death
I witnessed

28:22.048 --> 28:23.484
in the Jalozai

28:23.527 --> 28:25.834
refugee camp in
Afghanistan, well...

28:25.878 --> 28:28.663
I found I didn't trust myself

28:28.707 --> 28:30.752
to work on a living patient.

28:30.796 --> 28:32.841
You know, I almost
gave up the medical

28:32.885 --> 28:35.452
profession altogether,
after that.

28:35.496 --> 28:36.671
Really?

28:36.715 --> 28:39.065
What made you decide to stay?

28:39.108 --> 28:41.110
Oddly enough,

28:41.154 --> 28:44.244
it had a lot to do
with the Zucados.

28:44.287 --> 28:46.028
Hey, Doc.

28:46.072 --> 28:47.029
Hi, Mike.

28:47.073 --> 28:49.075
Well, I must admit

28:49.118 --> 28:51.904
that I don't get a lot
of requests for, uh,

28:51.947 --> 28:54.863
tours down in Autopsy
very often.

28:54.907 --> 28:56.822
But I'm more than happy
to extend

28:56.865 --> 28:59.085
the professional courtesy,
Doctor.

28:59.128 --> 29:02.262
You must see some fascinating
causes of death down here.

29:02.305 --> 29:03.567
Uh, true.

29:03.611 --> 29:05.961
Though, uh, pro tip?

29:06.005 --> 29:07.833
I consider my real job

29:07.876 --> 29:10.574
to bring closure
to the families of the victims.

29:10.618 --> 29:13.708
Might I be able to see
the victim from mine?

29:13.752 --> 29:15.449
Well, that depends.

29:15.492 --> 29:17.016
On?

29:17.059 --> 29:19.322
How long we're going to pretend

29:19.366 --> 29:21.455
that you came down here
for a simple tour.

29:22.804 --> 29:24.371
Yes, you're right.

29:24.414 --> 29:26.590
I haven't been entirely honest
about why I'm here.

29:26.634 --> 29:30.159
So you and Gibbs
think that there's a mole

29:30.203 --> 29:31.857
inside the building

29:31.900 --> 29:34.120
feeding Jonny Zucado
information?

29:34.163 --> 29:36.339
Yes, but first I need
to confirm something

29:36.383 --> 29:37.993
on the body of Zucado's cousin--

29:38.037 --> 29:39.473
the one I ran off the road.

29:39.516 --> 29:41.518
One Ringo Zucado coming up.

29:41.562 --> 29:42.650
Thank you.

29:48.874 --> 29:50.832
Yes.

29:50.876 --> 29:53.182
After our accident, when I was

29:53.226 --> 29:54.793
attempting to save
his life, I noticed

29:54.836 --> 29:57.230
that he appeared to be suffering
from LEOPARD syndrome.

29:57.273 --> 29:59.319
You notice the large freckling.

29:59.362 --> 30:01.625
Yeah. Caught that, too.

30:01.669 --> 30:04.672
Uh, he also had stenosis,
confirming the diagnosis.

30:04.715 --> 30:06.413
Wh-Where's this going?

30:06.456 --> 30:07.893
Last time I was in the building,

30:07.936 --> 30:09.633
I passed a construction worker

30:09.677 --> 30:11.592
who also had
the same freckling

30:11.635 --> 30:13.159
typical of LEOPARD syndrome.

30:13.202 --> 30:14.421
I didn't think much
at the time, but...

30:14.464 --> 30:16.205
That's a hell of a coincidence.

30:16.249 --> 30:18.686
It's an extremely rare
genetic condition.

30:18.729 --> 30:20.775
Given the odds, that
construction worker has to be

30:20.819 --> 30:22.821
related to the Zucados.

30:22.864 --> 30:24.431
That's got to be the mole.

30:24.474 --> 30:26.912
You think you can
still identify that worker?

30:26.955 --> 30:28.957
I never forget a face.

30:29.001 --> 30:31.090
Not a problem.

30:31.133 --> 30:32.352
JIMMY:
We've got a problem.

30:32.395 --> 30:34.136
And it is a big one.

30:34.180 --> 30:36.443
What sort of
a problem?

30:36.486 --> 30:38.445
I just found ice crystal
artifacts

30:38.488 --> 30:40.795
throughout the derma cells
of our dead witness there.

30:40.839 --> 30:42.188
Look at the back
of his arms.

30:45.539 --> 30:46.366
Freezer burn.

30:46.409 --> 30:47.671
Yeah.

30:47.715 --> 30:48.847
Based on this tissue damage,

30:48.890 --> 30:50.544
I'd say that the star witness

30:50.587 --> 30:52.851
against Jonny Zucado
spent some time in a freezer

30:52.894 --> 30:54.243
before they finally
dumped his body.

30:54.287 --> 30:57.464
I'd put his death
at about eight days ago.

30:57.507 --> 31:00.336
And that is a
problem because...

31:00.380 --> 31:01.903
Well, Zucado

31:01.947 --> 31:03.774
had this witness killed
a week ago.

31:03.818 --> 31:06.386
There'd be absolutely no reason
for his cousin

31:06.429 --> 31:09.911
to risk breaking into NCIS
just to hack some case files.

31:11.260 --> 31:15.134
So... what was
his cousin Maurice

31:15.177 --> 31:17.397
really doing in this building?

31:24.491 --> 31:27.102
Bomb squad's doing another sweep
of the entire Navy Yard.

31:27.146 --> 31:28.843
He wasn't planting
a bomb.

31:28.887 --> 31:30.976
We know the cousin was here
doing something in the building.

31:31.019 --> 31:32.412
We just don't know what.

31:32.455 --> 31:34.240
Which is why I
asked you down here.

31:34.283 --> 31:36.416
I have been working on
the notebook our intruder tried

31:36.459 --> 31:37.983
to burn
in the basement.

31:38.026 --> 31:39.985
As it turns out, ink burns

31:40.028 --> 31:41.377
at a different
rate than paper.

31:41.421 --> 31:43.162
So I scanned the crispy critter.Bottom line?

31:43.205 --> 31:45.251
Well, I was able to partially

31:45.294 --> 31:47.079
reconstruct one of the pages.

31:47.122 --> 31:48.210
It's a map of the building.

31:48.254 --> 31:49.995
Cuz wasn't trying to hack us.

31:50.038 --> 31:52.127
I think he was looking
for something in the building.

31:52.171 --> 31:53.694
What?

31:53.737 --> 31:56.436
No idea, but I got a lead
on who drew this for him.

31:56.479 --> 31:58.655
I pulled a handwriting sample

31:58.699 --> 32:00.483
and compared it
to every single

32:00.527 --> 32:02.529
Zucado I could find.

32:02.572 --> 32:04.661
You got a match.I did indeed.

32:04.705 --> 32:07.229
Your mapmaker is
another Zucado cousin,

32:07.273 --> 32:08.883
Emilio.

32:08.927 --> 32:10.232
But apparently,
everybody calls him...

32:10.276 --> 32:11.494
Freckles.

32:13.888 --> 32:16.499
I've heard that name before.

32:16.543 --> 32:17.936
Give me the thing from Freckles.

32:19.111 --> 32:21.548
Pick him up.

32:21.591 --> 32:24.116
How many cousins does
Jonny Zucado have?

32:24.159 --> 32:25.726
Four.

32:25.769 --> 32:27.075
Used to be five.

32:27.119 --> 32:28.990
Supposedly,
the other four ate him.

32:30.122 --> 32:31.688
To be honest,

32:31.732 --> 32:33.342
I'm having trouble
keeping them all straight.

32:33.386 --> 32:35.692
Okay, Freckles.
We know you made

32:35.736 --> 32:37.738
this map for Jonny Zucado.

32:37.781 --> 32:40.088
TORRES: And we know
your cousins used it

32:40.132 --> 32:41.263
to get inside
our building.

32:41.307 --> 32:42.830
What we don't know is why.

32:42.873 --> 32:44.745
Okay,

32:44.788 --> 32:45.920
I'll talk.If you want to spend
the rest of your life...

32:45.964 --> 32:46.834
I'm sorry, what?

32:49.054 --> 32:50.925
Well, that was easy.

32:50.969 --> 32:52.057
Yeah, I-I didn't
want to do it.

32:52.100 --> 32:53.493
J-Jonny made me.

32:53.536 --> 32:55.712
S-Said if I didn't,
he'd kill me.

32:55.756 --> 32:57.714
But if you give me protection,

32:57.758 --> 32:58.889
I'll tell you everything.

33:01.109 --> 33:03.329
Okay. Let's hear it.

33:03.372 --> 33:07.289
It all started 40 years ago,

33:07.333 --> 33:09.596
when Jonny dragged me
into his office

33:09.639 --> 33:11.337
and told me our cousin Ringo

33:11.380 --> 33:13.252
stole something from him.

33:13.295 --> 33:15.341
Something worth a lot of money.

33:15.384 --> 33:17.604
Apparently, your guys at NIS

33:17.647 --> 33:19.606
got ahold of it
after some car crash

33:19.649 --> 33:20.911
and Jonny wanted me
to get it back.

33:23.001 --> 33:25.046
So they slipped me
into this painting crew

33:25.090 --> 33:27.005
working in the building.

33:27.048 --> 33:28.397
Took me a few days
to figure out

33:28.441 --> 33:30.486
how to get
into the evidence locker,

33:30.530 --> 33:32.445
but I finally got in.

33:33.446 --> 33:35.013
The problem was

33:35.056 --> 33:37.058
getting back out with it.

33:37.102 --> 33:39.234
So I went back to work.

33:39.278 --> 33:42.455
Then I noticed this blond guy

33:42.498 --> 33:44.718
pointing me out to some agent.

33:44.761 --> 33:48.069
Somehow, Blondie made me.

33:48.113 --> 33:50.071
So, I stashed the keycard

33:50.115 --> 33:51.899
and I got the hell
out of there. I mean,

33:51.942 --> 33:53.553
I moved away, cut ties,

33:53.596 --> 33:55.685
and never looked back.

33:55.729 --> 33:57.992
Well, we have a map
that says otherwise.

33:58.036 --> 33:59.515
I had no choice.

33:59.559 --> 34:02.953
I ran into one of Jonny's goons
in Cancun last month.

34:02.997 --> 34:05.043
Jonny said if I told him
how to find the keycard,

34:05.086 --> 34:08.568
he might, mightlet me live.

34:08.611 --> 34:10.570
That's why I drew the map.

34:10.613 --> 34:14.313
Wait, so are you saying
that the keycard

34:14.356 --> 34:15.401
is still in this building?

34:16.706 --> 34:18.099
How should I know?

34:18.143 --> 34:20.319
I just know where I stashed it.

34:20.362 --> 34:21.885
And where is that?

34:21.929 --> 34:22.886
[loud buzzing]

34:22.930 --> 34:24.975
Yeah!

34:25.019 --> 34:26.499
Come on, baby!

34:27.717 --> 34:29.067
Oh, yeah!

34:30.938 --> 34:32.331
There it is.

34:33.723 --> 34:34.724
Yeah.

34:34.768 --> 34:37.118
DUCKY: I just left
Agent Torres.

34:37.162 --> 34:38.598
McGEE: Ah, there we go.Freckles had, uh,

34:38.641 --> 34:40.817
quite a story to tell.McGEE: Flashlight?

34:40.861 --> 34:42.863
BISHOP:
Yeah, well, after
you I.D.'d him

34:42.906 --> 34:44.343
to Agent Scott
back in 1980...Thanks.

34:44.386 --> 34:47.824
Freckles hid
the keycard behind

34:47.868 --> 34:49.435
a piece of drywall
that was being patched

34:49.478 --> 34:50.218
so he wouldn't
be caught with it.

34:50.262 --> 34:51.567
Wasn't a hotel key.

34:51.611 --> 34:55.397
Was a key to a Swiss
safety deposit box.

34:55.441 --> 34:57.660
Apparently,
Cousin Ringo

34:57.704 --> 34:59.445
embezzled millions
from the Navy.

34:59.488 --> 35:01.447
Zucado didn't like
being cut out,

35:01.490 --> 35:03.579
so he tried
to kill Ringo.

35:03.623 --> 35:04.667
Yeah, they fought.

35:04.711 --> 35:06.016
Ringo got away.

35:06.060 --> 35:08.410
Well, that must be
when he carjacked you.

35:08.454 --> 35:10.847
He was running away from Zucado.

35:10.891 --> 35:12.849
BISHOP:
Until you ran him

35:12.893 --> 35:14.286
off the road.

35:14.329 --> 35:17.811
And that is how the keycard
ended up back at NIS.

35:17.854 --> 35:19.117
Yep. Found something!

35:19.160 --> 35:20.335
[exhales]

35:27.081 --> 35:28.474
YOUNG DUCKY:
Yes, Mother.

35:28.517 --> 35:31.477
I will pick you up
from the airport tomorrow.

35:31.520 --> 35:33.479
No, not in a limo.

35:33.522 --> 35:34.697
[speaking indistinctly]

35:34.741 --> 35:35.872
Yes. Right.

35:35.916 --> 35:37.222
Bye, Mother!

35:37.265 --> 35:40.399
Goodness' sake.[door opens, closes]

35:43.228 --> 35:44.620
What are you doing?

35:44.664 --> 35:47.145
Uh, cooking you
a bon voyage meal

35:47.188 --> 35:48.668
before you leave for California.

35:48.711 --> 35:50.365
Steaks in the oven?

35:51.975 --> 35:53.325
You mad at me?

35:53.368 --> 35:54.717
I don't have a grill.

35:54.761 --> 35:57.416
No, but you got
one hell of a fireplace.

36:01.637 --> 36:03.596
Is this, like,
some American thing?

36:03.639 --> 36:04.901
'Cause it sounds
fairly gross.

36:04.945 --> 36:06.468
No.

36:06.512 --> 36:09.993
It's a...
Jackson Gibbs thing.

36:10.037 --> 36:11.430
My dad.
Don't knock it...

36:12.692 --> 36:14.259
...till you try it.

36:14.302 --> 36:15.825
Oh, well, thank you
for using your fingers.

36:15.869 --> 36:17.349
Oh, for goodness' sake.

36:17.392 --> 36:18.480
There we go.Mm.

36:20.569 --> 36:21.962
[exhales]

36:22.005 --> 36:26.662
I still can't believe
Zucado walked away a free man.

36:26.706 --> 36:28.664
Not enough proof to convict him.

36:29.926 --> 36:31.928
Dr. Magnus
must have missed something.

36:33.974 --> 36:37.064
As M.E., surely he
should've been able to find

36:37.107 --> 36:40.546
some physical evidence
tying Zucado to the stabbing.

36:42.069 --> 36:43.331
Yeah?

36:45.159 --> 36:46.900
Why don't you give it a try?

36:46.943 --> 36:49.424
[chuckles]
I'm not a doctor anymore.

36:49.468 --> 36:51.731
Mm, no,
this is different.

36:51.774 --> 36:54.255
M.E.s don't save the living.

36:54.299 --> 36:55.865
They help the dead find peace.

36:55.909 --> 36:57.780
Besides,

36:57.824 --> 36:59.521
you'd have a captive audience
for all of your stories.

36:59.565 --> 37:01.610
[chuckles]

37:01.654 --> 37:04.744
You join NIS,

37:04.787 --> 37:06.789
you might get another shot
at Zucado.

37:08.487 --> 37:10.967
Second chances are important.

37:11.011 --> 37:13.318
But not guaranteed,
Jethro.

37:14.580 --> 37:17.583
Especially involving
matters of the heart.

37:19.324 --> 37:20.977
Really?

37:21.021 --> 37:22.283
We're doing this again?

37:22.327 --> 37:24.067
Why did you really end it
with your girlfriend?

37:25.330 --> 37:27.114
Sniper school
only lasts 11 weeks.

37:27.157 --> 37:29.290
Then you could
come home to her.

37:29.334 --> 37:31.510
Then I'll leave again.

37:31.553 --> 37:34.077
Stationed who knows where.

37:34.121 --> 37:36.645
And what if one day
I don't come home?

37:36.689 --> 37:39.561
She gets a folded-up flag
instead?

37:39.605 --> 37:43.130
Seems like you're basing life
decisions on a whole lot of ifs.

37:43.173 --> 37:45.045
What do you want from me?

37:45.088 --> 37:46.960
The truth.

37:47.003 --> 37:48.222
You're scared.

37:48.266 --> 37:49.745
Of what?

37:49.789 --> 37:50.920
Love?

37:50.964 --> 37:53.183
No. Losing love.

37:53.227 --> 37:55.621
I think you're walking away
before you get hurt.

37:59.842 --> 38:02.367
I think you're more affected
by my breakup than I am.

38:02.410 --> 38:04.369
Because I know
what you don't.

38:05.587 --> 38:08.242
Love is never gonna come easy.

38:08.286 --> 38:10.418
Yes, it is scary

38:10.462 --> 38:11.637
and it's messy
as hell,

38:11.680 --> 38:14.335
but it cannot be
optional.

38:14.379 --> 38:15.641
So when true love
does come along,

38:15.684 --> 38:18.252
you need to fight
to hold on to it.

38:18.296 --> 38:21.995
You need to... climb
into that bottle with that ship

38:22.038 --> 38:24.911
and put a cork in it.

38:24.954 --> 38:26.956
Because it may never
come round again.

38:34.181 --> 38:36.183
What was her name?

38:39.491 --> 38:41.275
Maggie.

38:43.321 --> 38:44.844
What happened?

38:46.367 --> 38:47.760
Believe it or not,

38:47.803 --> 38:49.588
there are some stories
even I won't tell.

38:52.025 --> 38:54.767
Do not make the same mistakes
I made, Jethro.

38:55.985 --> 38:58.466
You're a good man.

38:58.510 --> 39:01.121
And I do hope
we cross paths again.

39:03.515 --> 39:05.386
I got a feeling we might.

39:13.699 --> 39:16.789
Oh, I can't wait to hear this.

39:16.832 --> 39:18.834
What new crime
am I being accused of now?

39:18.878 --> 39:20.401
Oh, uh, not a new one.

39:20.445 --> 39:21.750
You're under arrest.

39:23.230 --> 39:25.014
For the murder
of Rinaldi Zucado.

39:26.233 --> 39:27.582
Ringo?

39:27.626 --> 39:29.236
[laughs]

39:29.279 --> 39:31.543
That was 40 years ago.

39:31.586 --> 39:33.371
We exhumed his body.

39:33.414 --> 39:35.373
And, as it turns out,

39:35.416 --> 39:40.247
DNA has a half-life of
over 500 years.

39:40.290 --> 39:43.424
And guess whose DNA we found
under Ringo's fingernails

39:43.468 --> 39:45.774
the day he was murdered.

39:45.818 --> 39:49.430
Reunions are fun, aren't they?

40:30.253 --> 40:32.299
Shannon? Are you there?

40:34.040 --> 40:36.042
What do you want?

40:36.085 --> 40:40.133
I, uh, I only have a few days
before I ship out.

40:42.048 --> 40:44.050
And your point?

40:44.093 --> 40:46.487
Uh, I've been doing
some thinking.

40:46.531 --> 40:49.534
Uh, a lot of thinking.

40:49.577 --> 40:53.494
And I'd like to
ask you a question

40:53.538 --> 40:56.149
before I leave.

40:56.192 --> 40:59.239
What kind of question?

40:59.282 --> 41:02.155
The kind that a gentleman
doesn't ask over the phone.

41:02.198 --> 41:04.331
I'll see you in five hours.

41:21.087 --> 41:24.090

[line ringing]

41:52.292 --> 41:53.554
McGee!

41:53.598 --> 41:56.296
Hey, boss. Everything okay?

41:56.339 --> 42:00.039
[crowd chatter over phone]Yeah. Everything's fine.

42:00.082 --> 42:03.346
Uh, you guys still out
for drinks?

42:03.390 --> 42:04.783
Oh, yeah.

42:04.826 --> 42:06.219
And then some.

42:06.262 --> 42:07.786
Why? You need us to come back?

42:07.829 --> 42:09.875
No. No, no.

42:09.918 --> 42:11.920
So...?

42:11.964 --> 42:16.185
So... I was just, uh,

42:16.229 --> 42:17.839
wondering how long
you were gonna be there.

42:17.883 --> 42:19.711
Thought I'd stop by.

42:22.365 --> 42:24.542
McGee?

42:24.585 --> 42:26.892
Gibbs is coming, baby!

42:26.935 --> 42:29.851
