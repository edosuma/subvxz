WEBVTT

01:37.639 --> 01:38.971
We're doin' an APB,

01:39.933 --> 01:42.095
but we're keepin'
the public out of it.

01:42.728 --> 01:45.687
That'd hurt us
if she don't want to be found.

01:47.441 --> 01:49.023
Like Wayne said,

01:49.693 --> 01:52.060
somebody else might be
lookin' for her, too.

01:52.404 --> 01:55.192
We're sending it to Oklahoma.
The Missouri State Police.

01:55.282 --> 01:57.569
How much do we think
this is really her?

01:58.118 --> 01:59.450
I think it's her.

01:59.995 --> 02:02.032
Show it to the father,
see what he thinks.

02:02.122 --> 02:04.990
He don't know what she looks like now
any more than we do.

02:05.375 --> 02:07.583
He could make it into her,
even if it's not.

02:08.044 --> 02:09.725
Just give him somethin' else
to hurt about,

02:09.795 --> 02:11.833
and I ain't gonna do that to the man.

02:12.424 --> 02:14.381
So we don't know it's her.

02:15.719 --> 02:17.881
We find her, we can ask.

02:17.971 --> 02:19.052
What else?

02:19.556 --> 02:22.890
I got the file on the mother, Lucy,
from Clark County Sheriff's.

02:24.311 --> 02:25.893
August 12, 1988.

02:26.271 --> 02:27.512
Housekeeping found her,

02:27.606 --> 02:30.644
motel in Paradise, Nevada,
right outside Vegas.

02:31.109 --> 02:32.975
She'd been stayin' there
'bout three weeks.

02:33.070 --> 02:34.356
The OD fits.

02:34.821 --> 02:36.778
Right. Old news.

02:37.532 --> 02:40.070
The cousin, Dan O'Brien, no luck yet.

02:40.452 --> 02:42.660
Did nine months
Missouri Eastern Correctional.

02:42.746 --> 02:44.829
Bad checks. '85-'86.

02:45.165 --> 02:47.782
Have him in Vegas, '87.
Then he drops off the map.

02:48.210 --> 02:49.951
Vegas, like Lucy.

02:50.962 --> 02:51.962
Morelli?

02:52.464 --> 02:55.377
Yeah,
found a few former residents,

02:55.467 --> 02:58.005
just repeated what they remember,
nothin' jumped out.

02:58.220 --> 03:00.303
Had one guy said
a plainclothes took his statement,

03:00.389 --> 03:02.972
but there's no record
of that interview.

03:04.685 --> 03:06.972
Excuse me, Lieutenant West.

03:07.062 --> 03:09.224
They're wantin' me
to make a statement.

03:09.856 --> 03:11.973
- That's Lucy.
- You shouldn't be here, Tom.

03:12.067 --> 03:13.670
- That picture.
- You don't wanna see that.

03:13.694 --> 03:15.026
- No.
- Come on, now.

03:15.112 --> 03:16.756
I never saw it, man,
didn't really know it...

03:16.780 --> 03:18.299
- I'll tell you about it out here.
- Who's that?

03:18.323 --> 03:20.176
Hold on. Who's that, Lieutenant?
Is that someone...

03:20.200 --> 03:23.034
- Lieutenant, who is that?
- Listen to me.

03:24.663 --> 03:26.575
Calm down, Tom.

03:29.126 --> 03:30.412
All right, I'm sorry.

03:31.253 --> 03:32.253
I never...

03:33.255 --> 03:34.791
I never saw that room.

03:35.590 --> 03:37.081
Is that where she was livin'?

03:37.175 --> 03:39.792
You shouldn't've seen that.
Try and forget it.

03:40.512 --> 03:42.003
What are you doin' here?

03:43.014 --> 03:46.303
They wanted me
to make a statement. On TV.

03:46.393 --> 03:47.509
So I...

03:47.894 --> 03:49.556
Do you know somethin' you haven't...

03:49.646 --> 03:51.137
What are you lookin' at Lucy for?

03:51.440 --> 03:52.897
We're just gettin' started.

03:52.983 --> 03:55.646
I told you, Tom, we find
something out, I'll let you know.

03:55.736 --> 03:58.069
Yeah, but that girl.
The black-and-white picture.

03:58.155 --> 03:59.362
Who was she?

03:59.906 --> 04:01.772
- Does she look familiar?
- Shut up.

04:01.867 --> 04:04.075
- Here, look close.
- Who is this?

04:08.123 --> 04:09.475
Is this my baby girl?

04:09.499 --> 04:10.785
What do you think?

04:10.876 --> 04:12.538
Get back in the squad room. Now.

04:20.093 --> 04:21.300
You need to go home.

04:23.180 --> 04:24.546
I'm gonna give you a call later.

04:24.931 --> 04:25.931
All right?

04:27.058 --> 04:28.174
Who is this?

04:29.019 --> 04:30.305
Is that her?

04:32.314 --> 04:34.271
Is that what she looks like?

04:35.442 --> 04:36.603
Tell me.

04:56.213 --> 04:57.454
You were in that, huh?

05:08.725 --> 05:10.216
Woodard!

05:13.939 --> 05:15.271
Woodard!

05:15.649 --> 05:16.890
Get out here!

05:20.570 --> 05:21.570
Woodard!

05:23.240 --> 05:25.857
<i>We comin' in if you ain't comin' out!</i>

05:25.951 --> 05:27.533
What's goin' on here?

05:28.537 --> 05:29.618
Back up!

05:46.263 --> 05:48.175
Hey. What's happening, huh?

05:52.310 --> 05:53.310
Let's go!

06:01.194 --> 06:02.401
Freeze!

06:07.158 --> 06:09.241
Ah, fuck!

06:10.328 --> 06:11.489
Stay put.

06:11.580 --> 06:13.572
You think I'm fuckin' goin' somewhere?

06:43.612 --> 06:46.275
- That you, Sergeant?
- Put it down, man.

06:47.824 --> 06:48.905
I got you.

06:49.451 --> 06:50.737
Just put it down.

06:53.121 --> 06:54.237
I had you.

06:55.206 --> 06:56.367
Out front.

06:57.792 --> 06:59.579
That double-tap on the door?

07:01.713 --> 07:03.670
I don't miss 'less I mean to.

07:04.925 --> 07:06.006
All right.

07:07.218 --> 07:08.379
Let me return the favor.

07:11.014 --> 07:13.301
Put it down,
and I'll walk you out of here.

07:15.352 --> 07:17.218
I might've been within my rights

07:18.146 --> 07:19.762
'fore I took out those cops.

07:21.775 --> 07:23.186
We'll get you help, man.

07:24.527 --> 07:27.440
Got all kind of veteran affairs shit
can work in your favor.

07:31.743 --> 07:34.076
I don't want it to work in my favor.

07:39.209 --> 07:41.041
You gon' put this on me, huh?

07:42.712 --> 07:44.499
Nobody made you take the job.

07:47.384 --> 07:48.500
I'll put one in your knee.

07:51.096 --> 07:52.712
Then I'll kill you.

07:55.308 --> 07:57.675
I'mma count to three, in my head,

07:59.020 --> 08:00.556
and when I hit three,

08:01.481 --> 08:03.313
I'm gonna give you a full burst.

08:08.279 --> 08:09.986
I'm countin', Sarge.

08:33.513 --> 08:35.174
Hey, hey, hey!

08:41.270 --> 08:45.481
I'm speakin' to Julie now
in the hopes that she's out there.

08:46.901 --> 08:50.065
Julie, if you see or hear this,

08:50.155 --> 08:52.863
please, please call.

08:53.158 --> 08:55.741
Call me or call the police number.

08:57.037 --> 08:59.404
I'm sorry I let these years go by.

08:59.664 --> 09:02.247
But I love you forever, Julie,

09:02.500 --> 09:05.709
and we just want to know
that you're okay.

09:06.504 --> 09:09.872
And for you to know
that you can come home.

09:11.551 --> 09:14.419
And if somebody's
keeping you from coming home,

09:15.889 --> 09:18.222
we won't stop
lookin' for you, sweetheart.

09:18.725 --> 09:20.307
I'll never stop now.

09:21.269 --> 09:24.728
And anyone who might know
anything about my daughter,

09:25.315 --> 09:27.728
I ask you to please come forward.

09:27.817 --> 09:29.729
The police have got a hotline,

09:30.779 --> 09:32.020
and there'll be a reward

09:32.113 --> 09:34.480
for any information
that leads us to her.

09:35.658 --> 09:38.651
Please, keep Julie in your prayers.
God bless.

09:39.204 --> 09:41.696
Do you now believe
that Mr. Woodard was innocent?

09:41.790 --> 09:42.906
What about the evidence?

09:44.459 --> 09:45.825
I don't know.

09:46.169 --> 09:49.833
I just know that
my daughter's out there,

09:51.216 --> 09:53.253
and for so long
I thought she wasn't.

09:53.343 --> 09:54.820
Sir, do you think the police

09:54.844 --> 09:56.113
fumbled the initial investigation?

09:56.137 --> 09:58.550
Mr. Purcell won't be
taking questions right now.

09:58.640 --> 10:00.493
Mr. Attorney General,
what about this petition

10:00.517 --> 10:02.884
to have the original
conviction overturned?

10:03.394 --> 10:05.164
The possibility
of the Purcell girl being alive

10:05.188 --> 10:06.724
doesn't change our conclusion

10:07.148 --> 10:11.108
that Brett Woodard murdered
Will Purcell and kidnapped his sister.

10:11.194 --> 10:13.652
Now, what he may have done with her,
we can't know.

10:13.738 --> 10:17.197
David and Josie Woodard
want their father's name cleared.

10:17.784 --> 10:20.618
Now, we all understand
the violence Brett Woodard committed

10:21.246 --> 10:24.739
and view it as the reaction of a man
persecuted by the violence of others.

10:24.833 --> 10:25.869
Now, regardless,

10:25.959 --> 10:29.202
we insist he is not guilty
of hurtin' those children.

10:29.587 --> 10:32.375
We contend his posthumous conviction
was fraudulent

10:32.465 --> 10:33.956
and a significant dereliction of duty

10:34.050 --> 10:35.970
on the part
of the prosecutin' attorney's office.

10:36.261 --> 10:38.072
Is this a mandate
against Gerald Kindt?

10:38.096 --> 10:39.573
It's a mandate against
the lack of due process

10:39.597 --> 10:41.408
that could allow somethin' like this
to happen.

10:41.432 --> 10:42.468
Excuse me.

10:42.559 --> 10:45.051
What about the evidence
found at the Woodard place?

10:47.438 --> 10:49.646
Where was
this Perry Mason shit in '80?

10:49.732 --> 10:51.892
Even bein' a lawyer,
you gotta know this is outta line.

10:51.943 --> 10:54.060
Press is the only language
he understands.

10:54.154 --> 10:56.396
You're tellin' me you didn't enjoy
that look on his face?

10:56.489 --> 10:58.651
It's not about you or your old boss.

10:59.826 --> 11:02.318
Maybe consider that man
tryin' to get his daughter back.

11:08.710 --> 11:09.710
Those his kids?

11:09.878 --> 11:10.994
Mmm-hmm.

11:11.087 --> 11:12.578
They know who I am?

11:21.181 --> 11:23.298
Motherfucker made me carry his water.

11:23.892 --> 11:25.975
Like I need more of them memories.

11:26.644 --> 11:28.724
It's good to see you back on the job,
Detective Hays.

11:44.579 --> 11:45.865
Freddy around?

11:46.039 --> 11:47.371
He's changing oil.

11:48.166 --> 11:49.873
He can't take anything new.

11:50.877 --> 11:52.084
We're old friends.

11:54.839 --> 11:56.205
Who remembers?

11:56.883 --> 11:58.624
I saw the Trash Man guy, Woodard,

11:58.718 --> 12:00.237
but he was headin' away
from Devil's Den.

12:00.261 --> 12:02.048
Them two kids was ridin' towards it.

12:02.347 --> 12:03.929
Don't mean anything.

12:04.265 --> 12:05.676
He could have doubled back.

12:06.392 --> 12:09.100
Yeah, sure. I mean, he did it, right?

12:11.231 --> 12:12.972
And you're the one killed him, huh?

12:13.483 --> 12:14.974
I seen you in the paper back then.

12:15.068 --> 12:17.185
We just wanted to know
if you remembered that night.

12:18.321 --> 12:20.688
Maybe you could
take us through it again.

12:22.116 --> 12:24.233
You must be a stone-cold killer, huh?

12:25.578 --> 12:28.195
- Plenty tough with teenagers.
- That night,

12:28.289 --> 12:30.406
you told us Will was alone
when you saw him.

12:31.876 --> 12:33.117
Where was the girl?

12:34.504 --> 12:36.962
- Where was the sister?
- How would I know?

12:37.966 --> 12:38.966
He was all nervous,

12:39.050 --> 12:41.278
like, "I can't find my sister.
I don't know where they went."

12:41.302 --> 12:42.302
"They"?

12:44.472 --> 12:45.838
He said "they"?

12:45.932 --> 12:47.139
I'm pretty sure he did.

12:47.976 --> 12:50.263
I don't know, you wanna
slap me around some, make sure?

12:50.353 --> 12:52.686
He give you any indication
who they might be?

12:54.107 --> 12:55.939
You two can't be
very good at your job.

12:57.819 --> 13:00.277
Comin' back 10 years later,
try hangin' this on me.

13:00.363 --> 13:02.446
Nobody's hangin' anything on you.

13:02.532 --> 13:05.115
Maybe killer here wants to see
can he make me piss my pants.

13:05.702 --> 13:08.194
That don't seem
like a very tall order.

13:08.538 --> 13:09.654
Come on, then.

13:11.499 --> 13:14.242
Bounce me off the walls,
you black motherfucker.

13:15.295 --> 13:17.106
'Cause you think there's
something you can do to me,

13:17.130 --> 13:19.213
you might wanna take
another look at my life.

13:19.299 --> 13:20.415
Hold on, now.

13:22.593 --> 13:26.212
Mr. Burns,
I understand your hard feelings,

13:26.556 --> 13:28.718
but we just needed you to remember.

13:29.600 --> 13:31.262
And not for nothin'.

13:34.147 --> 13:36.059
Things might be what they are

13:37.275 --> 13:39.983
'cause you're the type like bullyin'
somebody weaker than you.

13:41.612 --> 13:42.612
And you don't?

13:44.532 --> 13:47.195
I was a teenager, me.
What's your excuse?

13:49.537 --> 13:52.405
I wanna thank you
for your help, Mr. Burns.

13:54.042 --> 13:57.080
Maybe you let me know,
you remember anything else.

13:59.380 --> 14:00.666
Mrs. Burns.

14:07.889 --> 14:10.256
Don't you wanna call me
a shit-heeled twerp again?

14:11.893 --> 14:13.885
Tell me how I'm gonna get ass-raped?

14:28.117 --> 14:29.358
Believe that guy?

14:30.328 --> 14:32.320
Actin' like I ruined his life?

14:34.123 --> 14:37.912
Please explain to me
all the hardships and tribulations

14:38.002 --> 14:40.836
of bein' a white man in this country.

14:49.097 --> 14:53.091
Verified Woodard's location,
which don't mean much.

14:53.851 --> 14:55.387
But they...

15:00.233 --> 15:01.690
Makes me think we need to get back

15:01.776 --> 15:04.769
on who those kids
were meetin' in the forest.

15:04.862 --> 15:07.400
I'm gonna tell you,
when I was his age,

15:07.490 --> 15:11.825
age he was in the room with us,
I was in the fuckin' jungle.

15:13.579 --> 15:15.866
And them toys we found in the woods?

15:16.416 --> 15:19.033
We need to run
those unknown prints again.

15:19.210 --> 15:21.202
They didn't even
have a database in '80.

15:21.295 --> 15:22.752
I made the kid skip college?

15:24.882 --> 15:26.293
So what do you think?

15:28.594 --> 15:31.382
I think that whole generation's
a bunch of pussies.

15:33.975 --> 15:35.557
You left Mena, 16.

15:37.186 --> 15:38.927
You been on the streets
this whole time?

15:40.398 --> 15:41.809
I been all over.

15:42.150 --> 15:44.107
Went as far west as Boulder
a few years back.

15:44.193 --> 15:45.809
You said you recognize this woman?

15:46.070 --> 15:48.813
Yeah. With the same crew a while.

15:48.906 --> 15:50.522
You know, other kids.

15:51.117 --> 15:53.074
We had a good little family.

15:54.078 --> 15:55.865
But she didn't stay long.

15:55.955 --> 15:57.696
What's her name?

15:57.790 --> 15:59.122
Mary, she said.

15:59.459 --> 16:00.700
Mary July.

16:01.085 --> 16:02.951
Was that her real name? I don't know.

16:03.045 --> 16:04.832
She tell you anything about herself?

16:04.922 --> 16:06.504
Where she was from?

16:06.799 --> 16:08.756
I wasn't close with her or anything.

16:08.843 --> 16:10.004
A little nutty.

16:10.094 --> 16:11.505
How's that?

16:12.054 --> 16:14.467
Like, couldn't get straight
on what year it was.

16:14.557 --> 16:18.301
Tell some story how she's
a secret princess or somethin'.

16:18.394 --> 16:19.885
Any idea where she might have gone?

16:20.521 --> 16:22.763
No, sir. Really.

16:23.441 --> 16:26.229
I'd try talkin' to workin' girls.
A lot of 'em end up trickin'.

16:26.319 --> 16:27.901
She ever do drugs?

16:28.362 --> 16:29.728
Not that I saw.

16:29.822 --> 16:32.530
Some of her stories
seemed like she used.

16:32.617 --> 16:37.703
She's a "princess
from the pink rooms."

16:37.788 --> 16:38.949
I don't know.

16:40.082 --> 16:41.869
Hey, said she lost a brother.

16:41.959 --> 16:43.871
She was lookin' for her brother.
That's right.

16:44.837 --> 16:46.637
- Did she...
- What happened with her brother?

16:46.672 --> 16:47.833
Did she say?

16:48.674 --> 16:51.542
I think they got put apart
when she was young, I don't know.

16:51.636 --> 16:53.030
She act like
she was runnin' from anybody?

16:53.054 --> 16:56.172
I don't know.
You hear that kind of thing,

16:56.265 --> 16:58.348
but everybody on the road's
runnin' from somebody.

17:00.603 --> 17:01.889
Write down names.

17:02.230 --> 17:05.314
Anybody in that crew with you,
anybody else might have known her.

17:07.818 --> 17:09.184
They're not in trouble.

17:09.612 --> 17:11.819
They get a favor
to call in with the police.

17:22.916 --> 17:24.157
Mary July?

17:25.336 --> 17:26.622
Don't know that's our girl.

17:26.712 --> 17:27.828
It's her.

17:28.381 --> 17:29.917
The missin' brother. That's her.

17:30.007 --> 17:33.250
I'm just sayin',
don't want us fixatin'.

17:33.678 --> 17:37.513
Hey. Till we find her, this is her.

17:38.099 --> 17:40.716
Hookers and runaways. Let's go.

17:44.313 --> 17:47.602
<i>Spent a few days
all over the place.</i>

17:47.942 --> 17:49.683
<i>Runaways, workin' girls.</i>

17:49.777 --> 17:51.817
- Want to ask you a couple questions.
<i>- Nobody knew.</i>

17:52.363 --> 17:54.946
<i>Or maybe they did,
but nobody talked to us.</i>

17:56.075 --> 17:57.511
Were you aware
that one of the officers

17:57.535 --> 18:01.324
who processed the Woodard scene,
Harris James, went missing in 1990,

18:01.414 --> 18:03.246
during the second investigation?

18:05.459 --> 18:06.495
Who?

18:17.513 --> 18:18.513
No.

18:21.183 --> 18:22.640
No, I didn't.

18:24.478 --> 18:25.810
Who was that?

18:29.567 --> 18:32.810
The field statements
said you talked to him in '90.

18:35.239 --> 18:37.572
A lot of people
around this thing are dead.

18:38.784 --> 18:40.070
A lot of people gone.

18:42.788 --> 18:44.245
People do that, miss.

18:46.834 --> 18:48.951
Most people I ever knew are gone.

19:05.811 --> 19:07.222
Foxwood.

19:07.521 --> 19:08.853
They've done all right, huh?

19:09.440 --> 19:11.056
Hate these suburbs.

19:11.525 --> 19:13.187
Like a plastic factory.

19:22.328 --> 19:24.991
Hello, hello! Welcome!

19:25.081 --> 19:27.164
I'm so glad to meet y'all. I'm Lori.

19:28.709 --> 19:30.416
- Come on in.
- Hey.

19:31.671 --> 19:32.671
Hey.

19:34.256 --> 19:35.292
All right.

19:38.886 --> 19:41.469
Your home is beautiful. It really is.

19:41.555 --> 19:42.796
Well, thank you.

19:42.890 --> 19:44.882
We got it after his promotion.

19:44.975 --> 19:46.967
Man been rentin' his whole life.

19:47.186 --> 19:49.553
I said, "You're an adult.
You can afford to own a home."

19:49.814 --> 19:51.601
Too much commitment for this one.

19:51.691 --> 19:54.479
Naw, just, like,
if somethin' needs fixin',

19:54.568 --> 19:56.901
I pick up the phone
and say, "Fix this shit."

19:57.321 --> 19:59.404
Now I gotta fix this shit.

20:00.116 --> 20:02.036
You two been together this whole time?
Since '80?

20:03.244 --> 20:04.701
I saw these two meet.

20:04.787 --> 20:06.574
And I saw you two meet.

20:06.664 --> 20:08.997
I messed with him a bit
first time he saw you.

20:09.709 --> 20:11.951
We were together two years,
and then we split.

20:12.545 --> 20:14.161
And about three years later,

20:14.630 --> 20:16.747
we run into each other at the IGA.

20:18.843 --> 20:20.880
So this time now, we're on five years.

20:21.470 --> 20:23.257
I add 'em together.

20:23.347 --> 20:26.135
I say seven years
with a little vacation in between.

20:27.143 --> 20:28.634
So when's the big day?

20:30.563 --> 20:32.145
Well, that is touchy.

20:32.231 --> 20:33.911
Don't be comin' to my house
to break bread,

20:33.941 --> 20:35.341
thinkin' you're gonna stir shit up.

20:40.072 --> 20:41.483
How's the case going?

20:42.324 --> 20:44.486
I saw Tom on the TV.
Have you been able...

20:44.577 --> 20:46.443
Nobody wants to talk about that.

20:47.204 --> 20:48.661
No, I'm curious, too.

20:49.498 --> 20:52.491
It's just the first week.
We got some stuff we're lookin' at.

20:52.585 --> 20:54.417
It's incredible she's alive.

20:54.503 --> 20:56.085
Do you know anything?
Where she's been?

20:56.172 --> 20:57.708
You see how late I been workin'.

20:58.466 --> 21:00.082
Maybe let's forget about it tonight.

21:00.176 --> 21:02.919
We found a runaway.
The guy knew her.

21:03.012 --> 21:05.550
We tried askin' others, street kids,

21:06.015 --> 21:07.551
but they ain't talkin' to us.

21:07.933 --> 21:09.911
Have you tried that women's shelter
on Pine Street?

21:09.935 --> 21:13.349
Can't really get into it,
stuff bein' classified and all.

21:13.731 --> 21:15.688
- Come on...
- Would you stop?

21:20.237 --> 21:21.569
I'm sorry.

21:21.655 --> 21:23.521
I'm a writer, I can't help it.

21:23.616 --> 21:25.949
Right. He said. You have a book.

21:27.661 --> 21:29.277
Yeah, it comes out next week.

21:30.039 --> 21:31.371
It's all about the case.

21:32.750 --> 21:33.750
And us.

21:36.420 --> 21:38.707
Well, I would love to read that.

21:39.548 --> 21:42.882
Well, I was gonna bring y'all a copy,
but he stopped me.

21:42.968 --> 21:45.005
Gifts shouldn't flatter the giver.

21:47.473 --> 21:49.385
We'll talk later
about what you been up to.

21:50.935 --> 21:53.894
Lori, you grew up around here?

21:54.104 --> 21:56.471
Little Rock.
I came here for college.

21:56.774 --> 21:58.060
"What I've been up to."

21:58.150 --> 21:59.391
What'd you study?

22:01.153 --> 22:02.769
Poultry science.

22:02.863 --> 22:04.729
They make rocket fuel outta chickens.

22:05.741 --> 22:07.277
What are you talking about?

22:07.368 --> 22:08.529
Jesus. You don't quit.

22:19.046 --> 22:20.378
Excuse me.

22:30.891 --> 22:32.382
You have a lovely home.

22:37.815 --> 22:38.896
Thanks.

22:46.073 --> 22:49.407
<i>There surely exists
a mutable area of soul</i>

22:49.994 --> 22:53.032
<i>where grief is indistinguishable
from madness.</i>

22:54.081 --> 22:56.744
<i>Standing above the box
of her children's things,</i>

22:56.834 --> 22:59.372
<i>she wept and clutched her chest.</i>

23:00.588 --> 23:02.329
<i>"This wasn't a happy home.</i>

23:02.840 --> 23:05.127
<i>"Children should laugh, you know?</i>

23:05.217 --> 23:07.800
<i>"And there wasn't much laughter
around here."</i>

23:12.683 --> 23:13.799
"Should laugh."

23:15.227 --> 23:17.014
"Children should laugh."

23:27.740 --> 23:29.356
"Children should laugh."

23:42.963 --> 23:44.204
The fuck?

23:49.553 --> 23:51.010
Oh...

23:54.141 --> 23:56.633
Babe, I should have read this
a long time ago.

24:43.857 --> 24:45.974
- Thanks so much, Mom.
- Oh, you're welcome.

24:47.027 --> 24:48.563
Always happy to see my grandkids.

24:48.654 --> 24:49.940
I know they love it, too.

24:51.615 --> 24:53.572
Becca's gettin' a cold.
She just went down,

24:53.659 --> 24:55.366
but you might want
to pick up some NyQuil.

24:55.452 --> 24:57.034
- Sure.
- All right.

24:58.205 --> 24:59.321
- Thanks again.
- Mmm-hmm.

25:10.843 --> 25:12.755
You didn't tell her about the divorce?

25:12.845 --> 25:13.845
What?

25:14.263 --> 25:16.880
How you referred to me the other day
as your ex-husband.

25:17.391 --> 25:18.757
In Sallisaw.

25:20.144 --> 25:23.262
What? You went to Sallisaw?

25:23.772 --> 25:25.183
Why didn't you tell me?

25:25.274 --> 25:26.274
Why would I?

25:27.526 --> 25:29.563
I didn't just go to Sallisaw.

25:30.654 --> 25:33.692
I found footage of her. Julie.

25:34.825 --> 25:37.192
Yeah. I got her on film now.

25:38.620 --> 25:40.111
You have?

25:41.915 --> 25:44.908
- You didn't tell me?
- Are you state police?

25:45.210 --> 25:48.248
Seemed like you were gettin'
real comfortable, havin' secrets.

25:49.006 --> 25:51.874
I let this dumb detective
think I was single.

25:52.551 --> 25:54.884
He talked. So what?

25:55.262 --> 25:57.595
Maybe I thought you took this
a little more serious.

25:59.058 --> 26:01.095
Now I know. No sweat.

26:01.185 --> 26:02.266
You know what this is?

26:03.062 --> 26:04.928
You trying to control me.

26:05.522 --> 26:07.980
Now you're running around,
doing your thing,

26:08.067 --> 26:11.902
you want me home,
washing clothes, making dinner.

26:12.905 --> 26:15.773
This will shock you,
but I have bigger dreams

26:15.866 --> 26:18.779
than just making a house
for you to brood in.

26:18.869 --> 26:20.701
I did nothin' but support you,

26:21.246 --> 26:23.784
whole time, years,
while you worked on that fuckin' book.

26:23.874 --> 26:27.584
Yeah, as long as I was around,
saw to the kids, kept your house.

26:27.669 --> 26:29.160
Well, now you're all over the place,

26:29.254 --> 26:31.712
meetin' interesting men,
tellin' 'em about your ex-husband.

26:32.299 --> 26:35.417
Do you really think that
I did something with that detective?

26:35.511 --> 26:36.718
I think...

26:38.680 --> 26:40.046
No, I don't.

26:40.849 --> 26:42.932
But I think you're a tourist, okay?

26:43.310 --> 26:44.642
I think you're a voyeur.

26:45.521 --> 26:47.808
Lifting yourself up
on people's bad luck.

26:52.152 --> 26:54.485
- That's not what I do. Or did.
- Mmm-hmm.

26:54.988 --> 26:56.900
Yeah. You...

26:57.825 --> 26:59.566
I think you use people.

27:00.285 --> 27:01.742
Like we're all stories to you,

27:01.829 --> 27:04.242
and you use 'em
to make yourself bigger than us.

27:04.331 --> 27:05.867
I see you, too, baby.

27:07.334 --> 27:10.168
You're using this case to avoid home.

27:10.712 --> 27:11.919
You're smoking again...

27:12.005 --> 27:13.462
Smellin' my clothes now, Ma?

27:13.549 --> 27:15.256
We're all just things in your way.

27:15.342 --> 27:17.174
Ten years, and you never got me right.

27:17.511 --> 27:19.377
You never got yourself right.

27:19.471 --> 27:23.010
Stop pretending that you're too dumb
to know that you're full of shit.

27:23.100 --> 27:24.500
Well, soon as you dig your way out,

27:24.560 --> 27:26.040
lend me the shovel.

27:26.687 --> 27:28.223
What's wrong, baby girl?

27:28.480 --> 27:31.314
She's sick. She can't breathe.

27:32.860 --> 27:34.817
You're all stuffed up, huh, sweetie?

27:35.946 --> 27:38.063
I can run out, get some medicine.

27:38.574 --> 27:40.941
We've got Vicks and some nose spray.

27:41.243 --> 27:43.200
I wanna be in your bed.

27:45.164 --> 27:47.121
Why don't we all
go get in the big bed?

27:47.583 --> 27:49.245
Can Mom read a story?

27:49.334 --> 27:50.575
Sure, baby.

27:51.461 --> 27:53.748
Let's get in bed.
Henry, you wanna come?

27:55.215 --> 27:57.172
Mom? Dad?

27:57.634 --> 27:59.546
What do "we do not"?

28:03.098 --> 28:05.160
- We do not say goodnight...
- We do not say goodnight...

28:05.184 --> 28:07.344
- ...without "I love yous."
- ...without "I love yous."

28:10.105 --> 28:11.641
- I love you.
- I love you.

28:30.500 --> 28:33.117
Wait. Ame? Becca?

28:35.714 --> 28:37.046
Oh, no.

28:39.051 --> 28:40.292
Where are you?

28:40.385 --> 28:42.718
Becca. Henry. Becca!

28:44.431 --> 28:46.639
Where'd you go, huh?

28:48.977 --> 28:50.343
Where's my family?

28:50.812 --> 28:54.146
"'They fed me behind bars
from an iron pan

28:54.233 --> 28:58.318
"'till one night I felt that
I was Bagheera, the panther,

28:58.403 --> 28:59.894
"'and no man's plaything,

28:59.988 --> 29:03.322
"'and I broke the silly lock
with one blow of my paw

29:03.408 --> 29:05.570
"'and came away.

29:05.661 --> 29:08.699
"'And because I had learned
the ways of men,

29:08.789 --> 29:12.453
"'I became more terrible in the jungle
than Shere Khan.

29:12.542 --> 29:14.124
"'Is it not so?'

29:14.211 --> 29:16.453
"'Yes, ' said Mowgli.

29:17.506 --> 29:20.840
"'All the jungle fear Bagheera,

29:21.426 --> 29:23.588
"'all except Mowgli."'

29:32.145 --> 29:34.387
"'Though thou art a man's cub, '

29:34.481 --> 29:37.144
"said the black panther very tenderly,

29:37.234 --> 29:40.898
"'and even as I returned to my jungle,

29:40.988 --> 29:44.106
"'so thou must go back to men at last,

29:44.700 --> 29:47.158
"'to the men who are thy brothers,

29:47.244 --> 29:49.657
"'if thou are not killed
in the council."'

29:56.211 --> 29:59.375
I announced myself
and told him "drop the weapon."

30:00.215 --> 30:03.253
He said when he counted three,
he was gonna turn and fire.

30:04.386 --> 30:06.002
I let him get to two.

30:06.596 --> 30:08.303
More than I would've given him.

30:08.682 --> 30:10.344
More than he deserved.

30:11.601 --> 30:13.467
I went through this twice already.

30:13.854 --> 30:15.311
I know how it goes,

30:15.605 --> 30:17.346
but maybe give me some space.

30:21.778 --> 30:23.189
What's happenin'? How is he?

30:23.280 --> 30:24.987
He's stable. He's out of surgery,

30:25.073 --> 30:27.110
won't know about the leg till morning.

30:27.200 --> 30:29.783
Look, we need the statement again,
while it's all fresh.

30:33.081 --> 30:35.073
Do not fuckin' speak to me
till tomorrow mornin'.

30:35.500 --> 30:36.957
At the earliest.

30:38.587 --> 30:41.705
Oh, God. Are you okay?

30:42.507 --> 30:44.339
It's all over the news,
all these people dead.

30:45.844 --> 30:47.585
Fuckin' cracker shot Roland.

30:47.929 --> 30:49.215
Might lose his leg.

30:49.306 --> 30:50.888
What happened?

30:50.974 --> 30:52.761
Are you okay? You're hurt? You...

30:52.851 --> 30:55.184
What? I'm fine, it's my partner's.

31:01.026 --> 31:02.813
What happened out there?

31:05.280 --> 31:06.987
I'm sure it'll be on the news.

31:09.451 --> 31:10.908
I wanna see him.

31:10.994 --> 31:13.097
- I wanna see my partner.
- No. No. Tomorrow. Tomorrow.

31:13.121 --> 31:14.862
He's sedated.

31:18.710 --> 31:19.710
Just...

31:21.296 --> 31:22.377
Sit down.

31:22.464 --> 31:23.875
I don't wanna sit down.

31:29.554 --> 31:31.921
You wanna go somewhere? Talk about it?

31:32.015 --> 31:33.176
Talk about what?

31:35.394 --> 31:37.181
You can't do anything here.

31:38.021 --> 31:39.853
Let's go, get you cleaned up.

31:59.126 --> 32:00.458
What's that you're wearin'?

32:04.798 --> 32:06.380
That smell.

32:10.679 --> 32:12.295
Ivory soap.

32:13.723 --> 32:15.589
Chalk dust.

32:19.020 --> 32:20.682
You wanna get outta here?

32:39.416 --> 32:40.952
Wanna take a shower?

32:41.835 --> 32:43.792
You want something to drink?

32:49.176 --> 32:50.383
Are you hungry?

33:06.318 --> 33:07.434
What are you doing?

33:59.579 --> 34:00.865
Come over here.

34:56.511 --> 34:59.629
There was a set of prints
in these files. They're gone.

35:04.144 --> 35:06.727
Pretty old. Sure they were in there?

35:07.147 --> 35:10.140
I put it there myself!
Box been sittin' there 10 years!

35:10.233 --> 35:11.769
I'm the one handed it over.

35:13.069 --> 35:14.355
Don't know what to tell you.

35:14.446 --> 35:16.153
Shit gets misfiled all the time.

35:16.740 --> 35:19.528
I'm tellin' you, this is
where they're supposed to be.

35:19.618 --> 35:21.429
We had a set of unknowns
taken from these toys,

35:21.453 --> 35:22.989
the unknowns aren't here anymore.

35:26.249 --> 35:29.367
You got a log book?
Anybody looked at these since then?

35:29.669 --> 35:33.083
Since 1980?
Books only go back a few years.

35:33.340 --> 35:35.002
Let me look at it, anyway.

35:37.177 --> 35:38.759
Go get 'em!

36:51.918 --> 36:54.376
Harris. Got something here.

36:56.548 --> 36:58.665
That looks like that boy's backpack.

36:59.300 --> 37:01.587
From the all-points, the dead boy.

37:33.418 --> 37:34.909
Motherfucker.

37:43.470 --> 37:44.470
It's planted.

37:45.472 --> 37:46.758
It's bullshit.

37:48.808 --> 37:50.470
You get any sleep last night?

37:50.560 --> 37:52.517
There was no real trial,
so nobody looked hard.

37:52.604 --> 37:54.891
I know I didn't.
But there's no fuckin' way

37:54.981 --> 37:58.315
that backpack was in that crawlspace
when that mortar went off.

37:58.401 --> 37:59.482
It's pristine.

38:01.738 --> 38:04.196
How long it take to process the scene?
Three days?

38:04.699 --> 38:06.361
Plenty of time to put it there.

38:07.827 --> 38:10.570
What about the shirt?
Why is it burnt up?

38:10.663 --> 38:11.949
I thought on that.

38:12.040 --> 38:14.407
They needed to sell
the girl was dead, see?

38:15.210 --> 38:16.792
Somebody was movin' fast.

38:16.878 --> 38:19.621
When that shootout happened,
somebody saw an opportunity.

38:20.048 --> 38:22.256
And our side slammed
the fuckin' door shut.

38:24.844 --> 38:26.005
What about Alan's people?

38:26.095 --> 38:27.757
Why didn't they say anything?

38:27.847 --> 38:30.590
State keeps puttin' off the subpoena.
They haven't seen it.

38:31.851 --> 38:33.092
It's all bullshit.

38:34.896 --> 38:36.478
What are we sayin'?

38:37.023 --> 38:38.023
I don't know.

38:38.107 --> 38:39.827
Could have been somebody
sneak in overnight.

38:39.859 --> 38:43.148
I'm just sayin', nobody was compelled
to look too hard.

38:50.995 --> 38:53.578
I don't know
what to do with this right now.

38:54.999 --> 38:57.457
We bring this to Blevins or Kindt,

38:57.544 --> 39:00.544
they shut us down for doin' the exact
opposite of what we're supposed to do.

39:00.588 --> 39:03.126
Come on, man. It's too big
for that political bullshit.

39:03.216 --> 39:05.003
It ain't bullshit to the Man.

39:05.260 --> 39:08.594
You ever learned that, you wouldn't've
been on a desk last 10 years.

39:15.812 --> 39:16.973
Lieutenant West.

39:21.276 --> 39:22.276
When was this?

39:25.738 --> 39:27.070
All right.

39:27.907 --> 39:29.773
Bring it over. Yeah.

39:36.291 --> 39:39.204
I'm serious about this, Roland.
This is huge.

39:46.384 --> 39:48.250
That was Briggs.

39:49.095 --> 39:51.508
Call came on the hotline last night.

39:52.223 --> 39:53.634
Says we need to hear it.

39:58.897 --> 39:59.897
All right.

40:30.637 --> 40:32.674
All right, get back.

40:37.435 --> 40:40.052
Come on! There you go.

40:41.898 --> 40:43.890
There you go. Come on.

40:54.452 --> 40:56.489
You best get in there, little man.

40:57.789 --> 41:00.247
Ain't no charity with these old dogs.

41:03.628 --> 41:07.247
Suppose you're a lover,
not a fighter, huh? Come here.

41:11.010 --> 41:12.171
Come on.

41:22.605 --> 41:24.688
Them eggs are fierce, huh?

41:27.610 --> 41:30.569
You show a woman
you got good kitchen skills,

41:31.447 --> 41:33.564
they know you ain't lookin'
for a cook.

41:34.867 --> 41:36.654
You listenin' to me, little man?

41:37.245 --> 41:38.781
I'm tryin' to help you out.

41:50.383 --> 41:53.296
Look here. Another stray.

42:03.021 --> 42:05.013
True, he's got flaws,

42:06.065 --> 42:07.397
but we'll hear him out.

42:09.610 --> 42:11.317
You sure this is his place?

42:11.404 --> 42:13.066
Yeah, I phoned.

42:14.532 --> 42:15.532
Why?

42:17.702 --> 42:20.115
He was always what you call
a people person.

42:21.664 --> 42:24.407
Never saw him have any use
for the outdoors.

42:25.293 --> 42:26.579
Let's go see.

42:28.421 --> 42:30.003
Give me just a second.

42:38.848 --> 42:40.635
When was the last time I saw him?

42:42.143 --> 42:43.975
I don't really know, Dad.

42:48.316 --> 42:52.435
Hey. Maybe now's
not the best time to do this.

42:55.865 --> 42:57.731
Y'all in the right place.

42:59.660 --> 43:01.572
You're lookin' good, Purple.

43:03.081 --> 43:04.617
Who's that old man with you?

43:07.585 --> 43:08.951
Yeah.

43:12.715 --> 43:15.207
He might be a little shaky,
is all I'm sayin'.

43:15.593 --> 43:17.459
Or he might think that...

43:19.347 --> 43:22.090
I don't know,
he might be a little shaky.

43:24.602 --> 43:26.764
He don't remember
the last time he saw you.

43:28.147 --> 43:30.309
He remember why I'm pissed at him?

43:33.319 --> 43:35.060
I don't think so.

43:37.240 --> 43:41.530
Sir, can I tell you, from experience,

43:43.121 --> 43:45.113
it doesn't do any good.

43:46.791 --> 43:48.453
Well,

43:49.877 --> 43:51.994
maybe I forgot, too.

44:07.937 --> 44:09.849
Where you keep your medals
and whatnot?

44:10.690 --> 44:12.306
The White River.

44:12.775 --> 44:14.562
What about that picture with Clinton?

44:15.444 --> 44:17.686
Might have lined the kennel with it.

44:18.364 --> 44:19.855
Thought you hated dogs.

44:20.491 --> 44:22.483
My best friend's a dog.

44:26.539 --> 44:28.075
Got pictures or somethin'?

44:28.666 --> 44:30.532
Let me get a look at your kids.

44:31.043 --> 44:32.955
Don't have no kids, man.

44:34.463 --> 44:35.999
You and that woman.

44:38.926 --> 44:40.542
Name escapes me.

44:41.929 --> 44:43.511
Y'all got married.

44:44.724 --> 44:47.011
You're thinkin' of someone else.

44:47.768 --> 44:49.430
You never got married?

44:50.062 --> 44:51.269
Not once?

44:52.982 --> 44:56.396
I'd have sworn you were married.

44:57.111 --> 44:58.397
Well,

44:59.280 --> 45:02.398
when you don't talk to somebody
for 24 years,

45:02.950 --> 45:04.737
you're gonna miss some shit.

45:09.999 --> 45:11.285
Come on.

45:38.027 --> 45:39.313
Go on, have a seat.

46:02.802 --> 46:04.384
<i>State Police hotline.</i>

46:05.763 --> 46:06.763
<i>Hello?</i>

46:08.140 --> 46:10.052
<i>You're looking for me.</i>

46:10.142 --> 46:11.804
<i>I saw on the television.</i>

46:13.437 --> 46:14.797
<i>What's your name, ma'am?</i>

46:15.856 --> 46:18.519
<i>I saw him on the television.</i>

46:19.151 --> 46:22.861
<i>Leave me alone.
Make him leave me alone.</i>

46:23.447 --> 46:25.985
<i>Ma'am,
is this about Julie Purcell?</i>

46:26.075 --> 46:29.113
<i>Do you have information
about Julie Purcell?</i>

46:30.079 --> 46:32.036
<i>No, that's not my real name.</i>

46:32.832 --> 46:34.698
<i>What is your name, ma'am?</i>

46:34.792 --> 46:37.284
<i>Tell him to leave me alone.</i>

46:37.378 --> 46:38.378
<i>I...</i>

46:39.380 --> 46:40.791
<i>I know what he did.</i>

46:41.173 --> 46:42.173
<i>Who?</i>

46:42.258 --> 46:45.342
<i>The man on TV
acting like my father!</i>

46:46.304 --> 46:49.138
<i>Can you tell me
where you're calling from?</i>

46:49.598 --> 46:51.840
<i>Where's my brother Will?</i>

46:51.934 --> 46:54.096
<i>I don't know what he did with him.</i>

46:54.395 --> 46:56.728
<i>What who
did with him, ma'am?</i>

46:56.814 --> 46:58.851
<i>We left him resting.</i>

46:58.941 --> 47:00.398
What she's sayin'?

47:00.818 --> 47:02.275
What's that mean?

47:03.321 --> 47:04.881
<i>Can you tell me
where you are?</i>

47:05.239 --> 47:06.775
<i>We can take care of you, ma'am.</i>

47:07.700 --> 47:08.700
<i>No, you won't.</i>

47:09.327 --> 47:10.738
<i>You work for them.</i>

47:11.287 --> 47:14.405
<i>Tell him to leave me alone! It...</i>

47:16.667 --> 47:19.535
<i>He took me, and I'm never coming back.</i>

47:19.628 --> 47:22.041
<i>Ma'am, can you stay
on the line, please?</i>

47:22.131 --> 47:23.872
<i>Could you talk to me?</i>

47:23.966 --> 47:25.926
<i>Just leave me alone.</i>

47:26.719 --> 47:29.086
<i>Ma'am. Hello?</i>

47:31.223 --> 47:32.964
<i>Are you there?</i>

47:37.897 --> 47:39.513
What's she sayin'?

47:39.607 --> 47:40.973
I mean, that was her.

47:41.692 --> 47:43.058
Man, where is she?

47:46.781 --> 47:48.568
Lieutenant West.

47:52.912 --> 47:54.119
Roland.

47:59.210 --> 48:01.202
You talkin'
to those TV people?

48:04.006 --> 48:06.498
I hung up on 'em several times.

48:08.427 --> 48:09.918
They're deep in it.

48:11.597 --> 48:13.554
Didn't want anything
to come back on us.

48:14.642 --> 48:15.642
"Anything"?

48:18.020 --> 48:20.262
Like killin' a man?

48:22.858 --> 48:26.226
Well, is it? Comin' back?

48:27.780 --> 48:29.191
No, so far.

48:31.242 --> 48:32.904
But that director
showed me some pictures.

48:37.081 --> 48:38.081
Yep.

48:39.125 --> 48:42.289
Dan O'Brien's body was found
in a drained quarry,

48:43.295 --> 48:44.877
southern Missouri.

48:46.465 --> 48:48.673
They're onto somethin'
about Harris James.

48:51.887 --> 48:54.095
How you gonna talk to these people,

48:54.890 --> 48:56.722
we done what we done?

48:57.852 --> 49:00.185
You don't know what you might say.

49:00.271 --> 49:01.933
Or might remember.

49:03.399 --> 49:06.187
If I remember what we done,
I'll remember not to say.

49:09.905 --> 49:12.739
Other thing I found out. Me.

49:15.870 --> 49:18.578
That note sent to the parents,

49:18.664 --> 49:20.200
letters cut out?

49:22.001 --> 49:24.163
Lucy wrote it. The mother.

49:25.212 --> 49:26.212
Why?

49:27.047 --> 49:28.788
How do you know that?

49:28.883 --> 49:30.920
Some things Ame quoted in the book.

49:31.010 --> 49:33.798
Things the mother said.
I'll show you. They line up.

49:36.599 --> 49:38.340
Why would she do that?

49:38.851 --> 49:42.515
I think, you look at the note,
what it's sayin',

49:44.523 --> 49:47.687
think she was tryin'
to make Tom feel better.

49:48.152 --> 49:49.859
Tryin' to get him to let go.

49:50.571 --> 49:52.904
'Cause she already had, way before.

49:54.533 --> 49:57.071
So what? So what if she did?

49:57.161 --> 49:59.778
We already knew
she had some connection to...

50:02.082 --> 50:04.415
That guy whose name you just said.

50:07.838 --> 50:09.420
He came to see me.

50:11.425 --> 50:12.916
Day after what happened.

50:13.552 --> 50:14.963
Hoyt.

50:16.096 --> 50:17.096
What?

50:20.601 --> 50:22.308
You never told me that.

50:22.895 --> 50:24.557
I made a decision.

50:25.606 --> 50:28.144
I had other things to think about.

50:28.234 --> 50:29.691
Includin' a family.

50:30.319 --> 50:31.526
I let it go.

50:32.321 --> 50:33.937
What'd you get from him?

50:34.907 --> 50:36.569
Nothin', I think.

50:40.955 --> 50:43.117
He knew about what we done.

50:44.500 --> 50:47.038
Seemed like he was in the dark
on some stuff, too.

50:49.213 --> 50:50.294
I can't...

50:54.426 --> 50:57.134
I really can't remember.

51:00.766 --> 51:02.758
Passed away some years back.

51:05.646 --> 51:07.558
You walked away.

51:12.236 --> 51:13.522
Not this time.

51:15.823 --> 51:17.985
This what you come to see me about?

51:19.994 --> 51:21.405
Twenty-five years.

51:21.495 --> 51:24.533
What, you doin' old man fantasy camp?

51:26.166 --> 51:27.373
You think you...

51:27.960 --> 51:31.795
Think you can just roll up here
and I'll be all, "Golly gee, partner!

51:32.548 --> 51:34.881
"Let's grab
our junior detective clue-finders

51:34.967 --> 51:36.629
"and have an adventure!"

51:48.272 --> 51:49.353
You...

51:52.901 --> 51:53.937
You know, '80?

51:54.320 --> 51:55.856
We stopped bein' partners.

51:55.946 --> 51:57.357
You get married.

51:57.656 --> 52:00.114
It's natural
for people to drift apart.

52:01.910 --> 52:04.994
This right now? This ain't that.

52:07.082 --> 52:08.573
All this time.

52:09.543 --> 52:11.205
You never picked up the phone.

52:12.171 --> 52:14.208
Never dropped by for a beer.

52:15.424 --> 52:17.586
Never said you're fuckin' sorry once.

52:17.926 --> 52:19.042
Roland...

52:19.136 --> 52:21.298
And I was gonna put that shit aside.

52:22.056 --> 52:23.467
Have a drink with you.

52:24.516 --> 52:25.757
Reminisce.

52:27.144 --> 52:31.013
Maybe just watch the dogs play
and the sun go fuckin' down.

52:31.106 --> 52:33.018
But look what you're doin'.

52:34.526 --> 52:36.142
How many of those
you go through a week?

52:36.236 --> 52:38.023
Hey, fuck you, man!

52:38.113 --> 52:39.820
I'm fine.

52:41.867 --> 52:43.574
Alone, out here.

52:46.872 --> 52:49.660
No woman. No kids.

52:52.628 --> 52:54.244
And no old friends.

52:57.132 --> 53:00.967
So that means I get to drink
exactly as much as I want to.

53:03.347 --> 53:05.555
You don't judge me, motherfucker.

53:07.309 --> 53:08.550
I know you.

53:09.144 --> 53:10.385
I know what you did.

53:11.271 --> 53:12.512
What I did.

53:14.817 --> 53:16.149
You talkin' 'bout my drinkin'?

53:16.235 --> 53:18.852
I'd whip your ass
if it wouldn't kill you.

53:22.157 --> 53:23.773
And you still ain't apologized.

53:24.660 --> 53:25.660
Roland.

53:28.205 --> 53:30.071
I don't remember.

53:32.251 --> 53:33.662
I'm sorry.

53:35.921 --> 53:38.709
I'm sorry, but I just can't remember.

53:41.135 --> 53:43.343
I don't... I...

53:44.346 --> 53:46.087
I can't...

53:48.642 --> 53:50.554
Can't remember my life, man.

53:52.563 --> 53:54.805
I can't remember my wife.

53:59.153 --> 54:00.644
I don't know.

54:00.738 --> 54:02.445
If you tell me I...

54:03.282 --> 54:07.743
I did something wrong,
well, okay. I'm sorry.

54:08.245 --> 54:09.245
It's all right.

54:09.329 --> 54:10.695
I'm sorry.

54:15.961 --> 54:17.577
I got this...

54:18.839 --> 54:21.081
This file I'm workin' on,

54:21.175 --> 54:23.792
and I read it every mornin'.

54:25.137 --> 54:26.503
And...

54:27.181 --> 54:29.298
But I'm missin' so much.

54:34.521 --> 54:36.353
But you remember some stuff.

54:37.483 --> 54:38.483
I mean,

54:39.485 --> 54:41.568
you know me, right?

54:42.237 --> 54:45.605
Nah, it's other things.

54:48.535 --> 54:50.492
Hey, look.

54:50.829 --> 54:52.991
You need help killin' time,

54:54.124 --> 54:55.456
I'm your man.

54:57.085 --> 55:02.205
I come up with ways to kill time
ain't nobody ever thought of.

55:03.050 --> 55:05.258
You wanna drink? Talk?

55:08.472 --> 55:09.679
Watch a ball game?

55:11.600 --> 55:13.136
I'm right here.

55:14.478 --> 55:17.892
But I don't want to dip so much
as a toe back in that shit.

55:21.276 --> 55:23.017
She could still be out there.

55:23.111 --> 55:24.818
Don't give me that.

55:26.240 --> 55:29.404
Half the cases you ever worked
never closed.

55:31.036 --> 55:32.493
You quit the job.

55:33.247 --> 55:34.454
I was there.

55:34.540 --> 55:36.873
There were other considerations
at the time.

55:36.959 --> 55:38.370
I just...

55:40.504 --> 55:41.790
Between me and Ame.

55:44.174 --> 55:45.665
And before I'm

55:46.927 --> 55:49.010
a droolin' fuckin' squash plant,

55:49.096 --> 55:51.258
and with whatever brains I got left,

55:51.348 --> 55:53.465
I'm gonna finish this.

55:57.479 --> 55:58.479
No.

55:59.898 --> 56:00.898
Yes.

56:01.233 --> 56:02.233
No.

56:02.901 --> 56:04.312
Oh, yes.

56:06.196 --> 56:07.482
No, man.

56:11.076 --> 56:12.317
Come on.

56:13.829 --> 56:15.946
Stir some shit up with me.

56:22.254 --> 56:25.247
How is it your son
don't have you locked up?

56:26.300 --> 56:28.292
He don't know how fucked up I am.

56:30.345 --> 56:32.052
Well, I got bad news.

56:33.348 --> 56:35.681
Your condition's worse than you think.

56:36.685 --> 56:39.302
You imagine
two old motherfuckers like us

56:39.396 --> 56:42.309
doin' anything
other than pissin' our pants?

56:43.984 --> 56:45.475
Come on.

56:45.569 --> 56:48.812
This is some sad senile shit.

56:53.660 --> 56:55.401
Seventy-year-old black man

56:57.539 --> 57:01.704
goin' batshit crazy, runnin' around
with a badge and gun.

57:03.962 --> 57:05.544
You shouldn't miss that.

57:10.218 --> 57:12.301
Well, I could use a laugh.
