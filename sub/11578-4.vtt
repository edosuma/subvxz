00:22.844 --> 00:24.629
In the criminal justice system,

00:24.629 --> 00:28.394
sexually-based offenses
are considered especially heinous

00:28.394 --> 00:29.585
In New York City,

00:29.585 --> 00:33.120
the dedicated detectives who investigate
these vicious felonies are members

00:33.120 --> 00:36.164
of an elite squad known
as The Special Victims Unit.

00:36.164 --> 00:38.779
These are their stories.

00:39.718 --> 00:40.987
That was a sweet-looking pass.

00:40.987 --> 00:42.568
Too bad he couldn't break it for a TD.

00:42.568 --> 00:44.706
Hurry up, boys, or
you'll be late for school.

00:44.706 --> 00:46.861
Imagine if we still had Keyshawn.

00:46.861 --> 00:48.221
Has anyone seen Emily?

00:48.221 --> 00:51.762
I know, but we'd really be smoking
with both guys out there. / Excuse me.

00:51.762 --> 00:53.212
Hold on a sec.
What?

00:53.212 --> 00:55.042
- Where's Emily?
- How should I know?

00:55.042 --> 00:56.908
Well, didn't anyone bother to wake her?

00:56.908 --> 00:59.149
Not my responsibility.

01:00.388 --> 01:03.772
Hurry up, Michael,
we leave in 10 minutes.

01:06.958 --> 01:08.306
Emily?

01:09.763 --> 01:12.585
Emily, come on, get up.

01:12.900 --> 01:14.223
It's time to go.

01:15.670 --> 01:18.437
Come on, sweetie. Emily?

01:19.752 --> 01:21.410
Oh, my god.

01:22.639 --> 01:25.477
Justin, come upstairs.

01:26.263 --> 01:27.508
Emmy!

01:27.508 --> 01:28.752
Emily!

01:30.094 --> 01:31.039
Em!

01:31.039 --> 01:32.933
Oh, my God!

01:33.346 --> 01:36.522
Seven-year-old female admitted
with subdural hematoma.

01:36.522 --> 01:39.415
Pappiledema indicates pressure building
for hours, maybe days.

01:39.415 --> 01:41.171
- Cause?
- Blunt trauma.

01:41.171 --> 01:42.936
I ran a skeletal and neural workup

01:42.936 --> 01:46.071
discovered a fractured left femur,
healed approximately six weeks

01:46.071 --> 01:50.186
hairline fractures to the ribs,
bruising to the arms and pelvic region.

01:50.186 --> 01:52.911
Vaginal trauma indicated sexual abuse,
so we did a rape kit.

01:52.911 --> 01:54.887
- Where is she now?
- Neurosurgery.

01:54.887 --> 01:56.771
- Her chances?
- Too soon to tell.

01:56.771 --> 02:00.765
- Who brought her in?
- Her mother. Jamie McKenna.

02:04.014 --> 02:06.871
- And the father?
- Out of town on business.

02:07.804 --> 02:10.044
Oh, great. Eight-car pile-up
on the Triborough.

02:10.044 --> 02:12.165
Overflow, five minutes out.
If you need me...

02:12.165 --> 02:13.611
We'll beep you.

02:14.393 --> 02:16.648
So, have a nice weekend?

02:16.966 --> 02:19.015
I don't remember having a weekend.

She was crying when
I picked her up from her father's

03:10.254 --> 03:12.737
but she's always upset
after her week with him.

03:12.737 --> 03:14.583
She was fine when
I put her to bed. / Wait.

03:14.583 --> 03:16.932
I thought her father was out of town.

03:16.932 --> 03:18.272
No. My husband is out of town.

03:18.272 --> 03:21.532
Her father is part of a time in my life
I'd just as soon forget.

03:21.532 --> 03:23.981
If we didn't share custody,
I'd never want to see him again.

03:23.981 --> 03:25.846
Can we go now?

03:26.279 --> 03:27.863
Justin, please.

03:27.863 --> 03:29.117
I got a quiz in trig.

03:29.117 --> 03:30.716
We're gonna need to talk to you, too, son.

03:30.716 --> 03:32.533
How long will that be?

03:32.686 --> 03:34.790
As long as it takes.

03:36.286 --> 03:37.850
- Oh, God!
- Where is she?

03:37.850 --> 03:40.555
- You stay away from her!
- I want to see her.

03:40.555 --> 03:41.911
- Just take it easy there, pal.
- Who are you?

03:41.911 --> 03:43.717
Detective Stabler, who are you?

03:43.717 --> 03:44.684
Emily's father.

03:44.684 --> 03:45.582
What's your name?
You got one?

03:45.582 --> 03:47.261
Denny Corea.

03:47.261 --> 03:48.560
How could you let this happen?

03:48.560 --> 03:50.044
I left her alone with you.

03:50.044 --> 03:51.519
What do you say we go for a little walk?

03:51.519 --> 03:53.364
I won't let him get away with this.

03:53.770 --> 03:55.325
I won't.

03:56.389 --> 03:58.624
Do you think he did this to Emily?

03:58.624 --> 04:00.625
He's always had a problem with his anger.

04:00.625 --> 04:04.198
But ever since I married Randall,
it's gotten worse.

04:04.360 --> 04:08.836
I know Denny hates me,
but why take it out on an innocent child?

04:08.836 --> 04:10.801
All afternoon she watched The Lion King.

04:10.801 --> 04:13.192
I cooked her a quick dinner
and then her mother picked her up.

04:13.192 --> 04:15.402
- Okay, what time was that?
- About 6:00.

04:15.402 --> 04:17.132
It's Jamie's week to have her.

04:17.132 --> 04:20.180
You know, I should have never
let her go back to that house.

04:20.180 --> 04:21.313
Yeah, why not?

04:21.313 --> 04:24.709
Because he touches her.

04:25.341 --> 04:26.736
Okay. Who's that?

04:26.736 --> 04:30.014
The animal Jamie married,
Randall McKenna.

04:30.376 --> 04:31.626
Your daughter tell you that?

04:31.626 --> 04:33.791
She didn't have to.

04:33.791 --> 04:36.220
I saw the bruises.

04:36.220 --> 04:38.045
When I asked her what happened

04:38.045 --> 04:40.686
she just started to cry.

04:41.159 --> 04:43.622
- You report him?
- Of course I reported him.

04:43.622 --> 04:45.790
But Jamie told the case worker
that it was me.

04:45.790 --> 04:46.954
Okay. Why would she do that?

04:46.954 --> 04:49.111
Because she wants Emily all to herself.

04:49.111 --> 04:51.569
Even if it means hurting her?

04:51.741 --> 04:55.375
Jamie wants what she wants,
no matter who it hurts.

04:56.564 --> 04:59.013
It's your basic "he said, she said"
with a twist.

04:59.013 --> 05:01.958
Mother blames the father.
Father blames the stepfather.

05:01.958 --> 05:03.481
What do the doctors say?

05:03.481 --> 05:05.332
Abuse is long-term,

05:05.332 --> 05:09.005
but the head injury occurred in a 10 to
24-hour window prior to admittance.

05:09.005 --> 05:10.845
Looks like she was molested, too.

05:10.845 --> 05:13.883
Rape kit turned up a hair and
a nylon bristle embedded

05:13.883 --> 05:16.561
- in abrasions to her backside.
- From what?

05:16.561 --> 05:17.774
Lab's working on it.

05:17.774 --> 05:19.546
If the girl was good
when her mom put her to bed,

05:19.546 --> 05:21.706
- it had to be someone in the house.
- Not necessarily.

05:21.706 --> 05:23.231
The bleeding was internal.

05:23.231 --> 05:25.142
It could have been hours before
the symptoms showed.

05:25.142 --> 05:26.653
What do we know about the father?

05:26.653 --> 05:29.292
Denny Corea, age 32, Cuban immigrant

05:29.292 --> 05:31.424
did time in '93 for robbery and assault.

05:31.424 --> 05:33.686
He's now working as a cook
at the Greenbriar School.

05:33.686 --> 05:35.416
The same school Emily attends.

05:35.416 --> 05:36.641
And the husband?

05:36.641 --> 05:40.379
Randall McKenna, 40-ish
investment banker with a Wall Street firm.

05:40.379 --> 05:43.733
Has one son with Jamie and one son
from a previous marriage.

05:43.733 --> 05:47.345
Both boys were home but the younger
one is learning disabled, non-verbal

05:47.345 --> 05:50.952
and the older one, Justin,
who's 15, couldn't add much.

05:50.952 --> 05:52.257
What about Randall?

05:52.257 --> 05:53.787
Still in D.C. On business.

05:53.787 --> 05:55.399
Which brings us back to Desi.

05:55.399 --> 05:58.827
So how's a society chick hook up with
a fry cook in the first place?

05:58.827 --> 06:02.113
In rehab. Jamie was kicking
an amphetamine habit and

06:02.113 --> 06:04.262
Denny was teaching
a dance class at the time.

06:04.262 --> 06:07.299
Jamie got pregnant and her mother
demanded the clinic fire Denny,

06:07.299 --> 06:09.331
or else she'd have their license revoked.

06:09.331 --> 06:11.213
Well, she's got the juice.

06:11.213 --> 06:13.925
Jamie McKenna's mother is Lois Huntington

06:13.925 --> 06:16.178
chair of the Avery Huntington Foundation.

06:16.178 --> 06:17.964
Widow of the late ambassador.

06:17.964 --> 06:20.257
Benson, Stabler, pay a courtesy call.

06:20.257 --> 06:22.392
Get some background
on the custody issue.

06:22.392 --> 06:26.356
You two visit ACS, see if
any of the prior charges fit the M.O.

06:26.356 --> 06:28.661
That Huntington money
buys a lot of friends,

06:28.661 --> 06:33.592
so let's get this moving before those friends
put my number on their speed dialers.

06:33.731 --> 06:35.717
You're saying Denny Corea raped Jamie?

06:35.717 --> 06:39.902
I'm saying she was vulnerable and
he took advantage of that vulnerability.

06:39.902 --> 06:43.158
But you supported the agreement
that awarded him custody.

06:43.158 --> 06:46.010
Jamie was in no condition to
care for a sick infant.

06:46.010 --> 06:47.955
I tried to convince her to abort.

06:47.955 --> 06:50.371
The drug abuse, did that start
at an early age?

06:50.371 --> 06:52.778
You make her sound like a common junkie.

06:52.778 --> 06:55.441
They were prescription drugs.
Diet pills.

06:55.441 --> 06:57.883
- So she had a weight problem?
- A discipline problem.

06:57.883 --> 07:00.966
She was an only child,
and her father indulged her.

07:00.966 --> 07:03.032
When he died, she indulged herself.

07:03.032 --> 07:03.934
Were they close?

07:03.934 --> 07:06.138
She was Daddy's little girl.

07:06.138 --> 07:08.262
And she took full advantage.

07:08.262 --> 07:11.740
She finally became so incorrigible
I sent her to boarding school.

07:11.740 --> 07:13.262
And how old was she at the time?

07:13.262 --> 07:16.090
Eleven. I wish I could say that it helped.

07:16.090 --> 07:18.683
At least the pregnancy brought her
to her senses.

07:18.683 --> 07:20.978
She straightened up and
she made a life for herself

07:20.978 --> 07:23.034
and she wanted to
share that life with Emily.

07:23.034 --> 07:26.735
Did her husband support her decision
to sue for custody?

07:26.735 --> 07:29.963
Completely.
And he paid the price.

07:29.963 --> 07:31.632
The day after she filed,

07:31.632 --> 07:35.698
Denny broke three bones in his face
and threatened to kill him.

07:35.833 --> 07:37.089
What did Randall do?

07:37.089 --> 07:40.605
Against my advice,
he offered Denny a deal.

07:40.605 --> 07:44.397
He wouldn't file charges
if Denny would agree to give up the child.

07:44.397 --> 07:46.007
Denny agree?

07:46.213 --> 07:48.993
He has until Friday to sign the papers.

07:48.993 --> 07:51.591
I actually hope the vile creature refuses

07:51.591 --> 07:54.590
and he gets the full measure of
what he deserves.

07:55.184 --> 07:58.725
Administration for Children's Services
154 William Street
Monday, November 20

07:58.725 --> 08:02.382
Our first contact with Emily was
in April of 1994

08:02.382 --> 08:04.187
when the hospital called us in.

08:04.187 --> 08:05.479
The baby was very sick,

08:05.479 --> 08:07.556
and since Jamie was struggling
with her own addiction

08:07.556 --> 08:09.398
custody was granted to the father.

08:09.398 --> 08:10.739
Even though he had a record?

08:10.739 --> 08:13.487
A prison record doesn't terminate
parental rights.

08:13.487 --> 08:15.710
How did Jamie's mother react
to the arrangement?

08:15.710 --> 08:17.941
Mrs. Huntington was
the driving force behind it.

08:17.941 --> 08:21.019
In fact, she used her connections
to push through the paperwork.

08:21.019 --> 08:23.095
And when did Jamie start
challenging that arrangement?

08:23.095 --> 08:24.657
About a year ago.

08:24.657 --> 08:26.922
That's when the abuse charges surfaced.

08:26.922 --> 08:30.792
We investigated, but we couldn't find
sufficient evidence to pursue a case.

08:30.792 --> 08:33.042
Broken bones ain't sufficient enough?

08:33.042 --> 08:34.813
Normal childhood mishaps.

08:34.813 --> 08:38.251
And how would you characterize
this latest "mishap"?

08:39.409 --> 08:41.943
We followed procedure.

08:42.390 --> 08:44.771
And that lets you sleep at night?

08:44.771 --> 08:47.813
I haven't had a good night's sleep
in 10 years.

08:49.750 --> 08:51.853
The Greenbriar School
329 East 66th Street
Monday, November 20

08:51.853 --> 08:54.103
Denny works three shifts in the kitchen.

08:54.103 --> 08:57.866
And still finds time to join
Emily's class for story time.

08:57.866 --> 09:01.422
He tells such wonderful stories
about his childhood in Cuba.

09:01.422 --> 09:04.216
Yet you filed an abuse report with ACS.

09:04.216 --> 09:07.144
I'm required by law to report any injury

09:07.144 --> 09:09.607
even those that could be attributed
to simple stress

09:09.607 --> 09:11.732
or prepubescent clumsiness.

09:11.732 --> 09:14.095
Which of the above caused a broken leg?

09:14.095 --> 09:16.660
Emily said she fell when she was
learning to ride a bicycle

09:16.660 --> 09:18.823
that her father bought her for her birthday.

09:18.823 --> 09:20.679
You don't think she was abused?

09:20.679 --> 09:22.665
I don't think her father was responsible.

09:22.665 --> 09:23.633
Why not?

09:23.633 --> 09:25.739
I have known Denny for six years.

09:25.739 --> 09:30.014
And, in all that time, I've never even
heard him raise his voice to her.

09:30.014 --> 09:34.433
Is there any other adult who had regular
or prolonged contact with her?

09:34.433 --> 09:38.821
Henry Abidin. He's the minister for
protocol for the Brunei Mission.

09:38.821 --> 09:40.481
He's a friend of the school.

09:40.481 --> 09:42.953
And he's taken a special interest in Emily.

09:42.953 --> 09:43.964
How special?

09:43.964 --> 09:48.273
Well, he reads to her, he takes her
to dance class and to the theater.

09:48.273 --> 09:51.506
But he loves the child and she loves him.

09:51.506 --> 09:52.791
No offense, Miss Dunlap.

09:52.791 --> 09:55.002
But kids don't always come straight
with their teachers.

09:55.002 --> 10:00.034
Is there anyone else, a friend,
classmate, who she was close to?

10:00.298 --> 10:02.019
Well, there is a little girl named Jennifer.

10:02.019 --> 10:05.083
They're always together,
they're like sisters.

10:05.083 --> 10:06.448
Hi, Jennifer.

10:07.325 --> 10:10.257
Hi. / I'm Detective Munch.

10:10.559 --> 10:13.179
That's a funny name. Munch.

10:13.179 --> 10:14.633
You think that's funny?

10:14.633 --> 10:18.132
I guess if I ever have kids
I have to call them "munchkins."

10:19.782 --> 10:22.517
Could we talk about your friend Emily?

10:22.827 --> 10:25.479
It's not nice to talk
behind people's backs.

10:25.479 --> 10:26.912
That's true.

10:26.912 --> 10:29.173
But I think it would be okay
just this one time.

10:29.173 --> 10:31.692
You know, Emily's hurt and
we're trying to help her.

10:31.692 --> 10:33.574
You want to help her, too, don't you?

10:33.574 --> 10:35.440
Yeah. / Good.

10:35.440 --> 10:37.974
She ever talk to you
about her friend Henry?

10:37.974 --> 10:42.100
He's nice. He takes her to shows and
buys her toy animals and stuff.

10:42.100 --> 10:45.104
He makes everybody laugh
with his funny songs.

10:45.104 --> 10:47.227
How about her daddy?

10:48.623 --> 10:50.765
She said he was mad.

10:50.765 --> 10:52.207
How come?

10:52.207 --> 10:56.197
Well, her mommy was
trying to take her away.

10:56.442 --> 10:59.304
She say anything else
about her daddy?

11:00.395 --> 11:03.185
She said they were going on a trip.

11:03.185 --> 11:04.968
Where?

11:04.968 --> 11:06.770
It's a secret.

11:06.770 --> 11:08.879
It's okay, we're her friends.

11:08.879 --> 11:10.568
They said they were going to Cuba.

11:10.568 --> 11:12.321
That's an island.

11:12.321 --> 11:14.163
Sure is, honey.

11:14.307 --> 11:16.446
I have a Barbie with hair that grows.

11:16.446 --> 11:18.625
- You wanna see it?
- Maybe later.

11:18.625 --> 11:20.643
Fin and I have to help Emily now.

11:20.643 --> 11:22.999
But thank you for talking to me.

11:22.999 --> 11:24.613
You're welcome.

11:24.993 --> 11:27.433
- Can I go now?
- Sure.

11:33.281 --> 11:36.102
- I'll check the airlines.
- Good.

11:36.915 --> 11:40.403
- Can you move?
- If you get me a forklift.

11:42.051 --> 11:44.382
Denny Corea's looking
like a real hothead.

11:44.382 --> 11:47.958
Put Randall McKenna in the hospital
day after Jamie filed for custody.

11:47.958 --> 11:51.728
He's got until Friday to choose between
jail time and signing away his kid.

11:51.728 --> 11:52.866
What's the matter with you?

11:52.866 --> 11:54.294
Injured in the line of duty.

11:54.294 --> 11:55.720
Yeah, now I'm a pain in my own ass.

11:55.720 --> 11:57.435
But, enough about me.

11:57.435 --> 12:00.518
One of Emily's friends told us
about a trip Denny was planning.

12:00.518 --> 12:03.313
A buddy in customs checked
the manifest for flights to Cuba

12:03.313 --> 12:05.395
and guess what he found?

12:05.533 --> 12:10.315
Two tickets in Denny and Emily's name
departing for Cuba via Quebec this Friday.

12:10.315 --> 12:11.495
One-way.

12:11.495 --> 12:15.491
Well maybe it's time we brought
Mr. Corea in for a little chat.

12:18.547 --> 12:22.051
I just wanted to get her away from him.

12:22.051 --> 12:23.675
Children's Services
wouldn't believe me.

12:23.675 --> 12:25.069
I didn't know what else to do.

12:25.069 --> 12:27.830
Well, smacking Randall around
didn't exactly bolster your case.

12:27.830 --> 12:30.431
I wanted to talk to him.
He is a father.

12:30.431 --> 12:33.385
I thought I could shame him into
leaving my daughter alone.

12:33.385 --> 12:34.891
By rearranging his face?

12:34.891 --> 12:36.771
He pushed me, okay?
It happened so fast.

12:36.771 --> 12:38.239
Is that what happened
with the store clerk?

12:38.239 --> 12:39.462
I don't understand.

12:39.462 --> 12:41.235
A few years back.
The convenience store?

12:41.235 --> 12:43.030
You did time for beating him
to a bloody pulp.

12:43.030 --> 12:44.470
He tried to shoot me.

12:44.470 --> 12:45.960
Because you were robbing his store.

12:45.960 --> 12:47.551
I was hungry. I just defected.

12:47.551 --> 12:49.626
The government says, "Welcome to America,
goodbye and good luck."

12:49.626 --> 12:52.850
Denny, that is a very sad story.
But if you're such a victim

12:52.850 --> 12:55.304
why is it that everyone else
winds up getting hurt?

12:55.304 --> 12:56.795
You are twisting everything.

12:56.795 --> 12:59.578
Like you did with Emily?
You twisted her little leg until it broke?

12:59.578 --> 13:01.709
I would never hurt my daughter.

13:01.709 --> 13:03.826
- I'm sure you never meant to.
- Like you never meant to hurt Randall...

13:03.826 --> 13:05.383
- Or the store clerk.
- Or Jamie.

13:05.383 --> 13:09.321
Please! / Denny, now come on.
It's time to come clean here, all right?

13:09.321 --> 13:12.305
For Emily's sake.
It's just time to do the right thing.

13:12.305 --> 13:16.242
We wanna help you
but you gotta tell us the truth.

13:18.120 --> 13:20.645
Guys. Got a minute?

13:28.142 --> 13:30.267
What the hell, Captain?
He was about to pop.

13:30.267 --> 13:32.450
I just talked to the lab.
Denny's not our man.

13:32.450 --> 13:33.326
What?

13:33.326 --> 13:37.442
Blood type doesn't match
the hair sample from the rape kit.

13:38.073 --> 13:42.614
With Denny out of the picture
we need to reassess our profile

13:42.614 --> 13:46.263
so I've asked Dr. Skoda here
to lend us a hand.

13:46.263 --> 13:50.332
This one's tough. The molestation occurred
in such a complex social matrix...

13:50.332 --> 13:51.952
English, please.

13:51.952 --> 13:54.222
Child abusers are generally adept at

13:54.222 --> 13:57.272
manipulating emotions
and shading perceptions.

13:57.272 --> 13:59.428
But in this case,
the abuser had to contend

13:59.428 --> 14:02.641
with two separate social and
familial groups

14:02.641 --> 14:05.434
one of which presumably
offered a safe haven.

14:05.434 --> 14:08.315
That requires some finely
tuned social radar.

14:08.315 --> 14:11.288
Well, if he's so finely tuned,
why go after a kid?

14:11.288 --> 14:14.466
It's not about intimacy.
It's about displaced rage.

14:14.466 --> 14:15.719
Rage over what?

14:15.719 --> 14:18.731
Sexual inadequacies,
abuse in his childhood.

14:18.731 --> 14:20.778
So someone with low self-esteem.

14:20.778 --> 14:21.804
Yeah.

14:21.804 --> 14:24.618
But that's where the profile gets tricky.

14:24.618 --> 14:28.541
The same insecurities that drive him
to aberrant behavior in one area

14:28.541 --> 14:31.044
can also drive him to excel in another.

14:31.044 --> 14:35.091
So, he could be, whatever,
head of a Fortune 500 company.

14:35.091 --> 14:37.611
I guess Randall McKenna
moves to the top of the list.

14:37.611 --> 14:39.292
You said he was out of town.

14:39.292 --> 14:41.587
Yeah. Well, I called his office
to schedule an interview.

14:41.587 --> 14:44.850
Found out his plane didn't leave
until 7:00 Monday morning.

14:44.850 --> 14:48.852
Didn't Denny say something about a friend
who took Emily to go see The Lion King?

14:48.852 --> 14:51.395
Yeah. Henry Abidin.

14:51.395 --> 14:53.787
Minister of protocol for the Brunei Mission.

14:53.787 --> 14:56.759
Well, we may run into a diplomatic brick wall

14:56.759 --> 14:58.903
but see if he's willing to talk.

14:58.903 --> 15:00.961
I assume your meeting is on the books?

15:00.961 --> 15:02.988
Yeah. Done. Out.

15:03.855 --> 15:06.988
Office of Randall McKenna
400 Wall Street
Tuesday, November 21

15:06.988 --> 15:10.710
Listen, I don't mean to be rude, but
I have a meeting at 30 Rock in 40 minutes.

15:10.710 --> 15:13.364
Yeah, well, take five, we'll be
out of your hair in no time.

15:13.364 --> 15:16.208
I'm sorry. Look, it's been
a hard couple of weeks.

15:16.208 --> 15:17.082
How can I help you?

15:17.082 --> 15:18.631
Just a little history.

15:18.631 --> 15:20.680
You and Jamie have been married
for what, three years?

15:20.680 --> 15:22.566
Yeah. / How'd you two hook up?

15:22.566 --> 15:23.837
Her mother was a client.

15:23.837 --> 15:25.474
She introduced us at a party.

15:25.474 --> 15:28.233
Were you still married to your first wife
at the time? / Separated.

15:28.233 --> 15:31.342
So Jamie's pregnancy only
hastened the inevitable.

15:31.342 --> 15:33.621
Michael's four.
We did the math.

15:35.783 --> 15:37.187
Is there a point to this conversation?

15:37.187 --> 15:39.076
Where were you Sunday night?

15:39.076 --> 15:41.003
I was here, then at home. Why?

15:41.003 --> 15:43.524
Spend any quality time
with your stepdaughter?

15:43.524 --> 15:44.639
What are you driving at?

15:44.639 --> 15:47.312
Denny Corea says
you've been molesting her.

15:48.576 --> 15:50.457
And you believed him?

15:50.457 --> 15:51.819
Look what he did to me.

15:51.819 --> 15:55.228
He also said that you tried to blackmail
him into giving up custody.

15:55.228 --> 15:57.457
I offered him an opportunity
to avoid prison.

15:57.457 --> 15:59.526
And to close off any further investigation.

15:59.526 --> 16:00.992
Oh, this is nuts.

16:00.992 --> 16:02.976
You had access.

16:03.216 --> 16:05.191
She slept in the next bedroom.

16:05.191 --> 16:07.137
I thought Denny was
your primary suspect.

16:07.137 --> 16:09.934
Blood analysis excluded him.

16:10.526 --> 16:12.344
And now you're scrambling
to cover your ass.

16:12.344 --> 16:14.243
Of course, you could help
expose our better halves

16:14.243 --> 16:17.221
by offering up a sample of your own.

16:17.221 --> 16:18.394
You've already insulted me.

16:18.394 --> 16:20.884
I'll be damned if I will allow you
to invade my privacy.

16:20.884 --> 16:23.560
We'll get a court order to compel you.

16:24.652 --> 16:28.523
Well, then, I guess from now on
you'll be talking to my lawyer.

16:28.523 --> 16:30.885
Now, if you'll excuse me.

16:31.239 --> 16:33.492
I'm already late for my meeting.

16:36.244 --> 16:37.863
Mission of Brunei Darussalam
422 East 64th Street
Tuesday, November 21

16:37.863 --> 16:39.357
Right this way, gentlemen.

16:39.357 --> 16:41.787
The minister will be right with you.

16:47.892 --> 16:49.931
I got one of those hanging
from a rope in my shower.

16:49.931 --> 16:53.179
Only mine's got a spring-fresh scent.

16:53.720 --> 16:56.362
Sorry to keep you waiting, gentlemen.
Henry Abidin.

16:56.362 --> 16:57.870
Odafin Tutuola.

16:57.870 --> 17:00.396
Oh, Tutuola. "The gentle one."

17:00.396 --> 17:01.981
You know Yoruban?

17:01.981 --> 17:04.217
In my business, one tends to
know a little about a lot.

17:04.217 --> 17:07.627
John Munch. Romanian,
"the handsome one."

17:07.830 --> 17:10.281
I assume your visit concerns poor Emily.

17:10.281 --> 17:11.348
Yes, it does.

17:11.348 --> 17:12.686
Her grandmother told me.

17:12.686 --> 17:13.929
You know Lois Huntington?

17:13.929 --> 17:15.809
No, we met while Avery was still alive.

17:15.809 --> 17:17.534
In fact, it was she who first suggested

17:17.534 --> 17:19.704
The Greenbriar School might be
a potential beneficiary

17:19.704 --> 17:21.769
of the royal family's charitable interests.

17:21.769 --> 17:24.240
Were you aware that her granddaughter
was a student there?

17:24.240 --> 17:25.059
Yes.

17:25.059 --> 17:28.893
But the fact that Emily proved to be such
a delight was an unexpected bonus.

17:28.893 --> 17:30.889
You took her to a show on Sunday.

17:30.889 --> 17:33.010
The matinee of The Lion King.

17:33.010 --> 17:34.624
Where did you go after that?

17:34.624 --> 17:36.135
I brought her home to her father.

17:36.135 --> 17:37.576
I don't suppose you have anyone
to corroborate

17:37.576 --> 17:39.881
your whereabouts between
the show and home.

17:39.881 --> 17:40.837
As a matter of fact,

17:40.837 --> 17:43.859
her grandmother joined us
at the theatre and my driver drove us.

17:43.859 --> 17:46.447
Grandma's a regular on these field trips?

17:46.447 --> 17:47.734
She is.

17:47.734 --> 17:49.821
Emily's father's in sync with that?

17:49.821 --> 17:52.098
Considering the animosity
between him and Lois

17:52.098 --> 17:54.492
we felt it best he not know.

17:54.492 --> 17:57.103
Any other secrets you wanna tell us?

17:57.365 --> 18:00.836
Gentlemen, I know
it's your job to be suspicious.

18:00.836 --> 18:04.489
But that little girl won my heart with
her joyful spirit.

18:04.489 --> 18:07.424
And I'll do whatever I can to see
to it the person responsible

18:07.424 --> 18:11.585
for dimming that spirit goes to jail
for a very long time.

18:12.767 --> 18:15.199
- What, more questions?
- Yep.

18:15.199 --> 18:17.617
What time did your dad leave for
the airport on Monday morning?

18:17.617 --> 18:19.240
I don't know, I was asleep.

18:19.240 --> 18:21.729
Okay, can you tell us what time
he came home the night before?

18:21.729 --> 18:23.519
I don't know, I was asleep.

18:23.519 --> 18:24.857
Hear any noises during the night?

18:24.857 --> 18:26.469
Just him and Jamie arguing.

18:26.469 --> 18:27.915
Yeah? Over what?
What else?

18:27.915 --> 18:28.946
Emily.

18:28.946 --> 18:29.885
Why?

18:29.885 --> 18:32.504
I don't know. I put my headset on
so I didn't have to listen.

18:32.504 --> 18:33.760
They argue a lot?

18:33.760 --> 18:36.158
All the time. It's why
he never comes home anymore.

18:36.158 --> 18:37.705
Hey, Justin!

18:37.900 --> 18:39.221
We done?

18:39.221 --> 18:40.826
For now. Yeah.

18:43.385 --> 18:45.451
So, what have we got?

18:45.451 --> 18:47.503
Henry Abidin waived his diplomatic status

18:47.503 --> 18:49.995
and agreed to submit
a blood sample for analysis.

18:49.995 --> 18:51.514
And Randall McKenna?

18:51.514 --> 18:53.255
Heard from his lawyer.
He's fighting.

18:53.255 --> 18:55.269
Odd choice for a loving stepfather.

18:55.269 --> 18:58.178
Family's like a jigsaw puzzle.
Nobody gives you the whole picture.

18:58.178 --> 18:59.724
Well, let's look at the pieces we've got.

18:59.724 --> 19:04.070
One suspect eliminated, one cooperating
and one hiding behind his lawyer.

19:04.070 --> 19:05.645
Picture's getting clearer.

19:05.645 --> 19:07.241
What's the status on the court order?

19:07.241 --> 19:09.547
Cabot's meeting with
Judge Petrovsky in the morning.

19:09.547 --> 19:12.340
- And the little girl?
- Still in a coma.

19:12.340 --> 19:15.377
Well, let's all say a prayer this
doesn't turn into a murder case.

19:15.377 --> 19:16.585
Sad as it sounds,

19:16.585 --> 19:20.455
she's probably safer in that hospital bed
than she's ever been in her own.

19:24.877 --> 19:27.898
Hospital X-ray tech, report to 5 East.

20:04.702 --> 20:07.029
Chambers of Judge Lena Petrovsky
Wednesday, November 22

20:07.029 --> 20:08.392
Investigating officers believe

20:08.392 --> 20:11.963
the head trauma is an extension
of an ongoing pattern of abuse.

20:11.963 --> 20:15.900
Blood analysis has excluded her father
and Mr. Abidin from the suspect pool

20:15.900 --> 20:18.207
leaving only Mr. McKenna
with access and opportunity.

20:18.207 --> 20:21.861
There is not a shred of solid evidence
linking my client to the crime.

20:21.861 --> 20:24.674
Mr. McKenna refuses to submit
a sample for analysis.

20:24.674 --> 20:27.034
They haven't established
exclusive opportunity.

20:27.034 --> 20:29.581
We can provide a detailed timeline
of Emily's whereabouts

20:29.581 --> 20:32.994
during the 24 hours prior to
her admission into the hospital.

20:32.994 --> 20:35.958
Mr. McKenna has
a clear window of access.

20:35.958 --> 20:38.925
Can your client account for
his whereabouts during this window?

20:38.925 --> 20:41.060
He was home, your Honor,
with his family.

20:41.060 --> 20:44.208
Not to be redundant,
but that's precisely our point.

20:44.208 --> 20:46.307
A point well-taken.

20:46.307 --> 20:48.943
I hereby order your client
to present himself

20:48.943 --> 20:52.790
to the medical examiner
by 10:00 a.m. Tomorrow, Mr. Woodrow

20:52.790 --> 20:55.458
or he will find himself in contempt.

20:56.130 --> 20:57.299
Hey, Alex.

20:57.299 --> 21:00.374
We heard that Randall McKenna didn't
bother to show up to his own hearing.

21:00.374 --> 21:02.828
Why should he? His lawyer's already
on his way to appeal the ruling.

21:02.828 --> 21:03.808
Did he have grounds?

21:03.808 --> 21:06.585
No, but Woodrow's got to blow
some smoke to earn his retainer.

21:06.585 --> 21:08.406
End of the day, I'm sure we'll prevail.

21:08.406 --> 21:10.735
Olivia, I want you to put a tag
on Mr. McKenna.

21:10.735 --> 21:14.088
If he is one minute late to the M.E
I want him arrested for contempt.

21:14.088 --> 21:16.931
Yeah. Thanks, John.
There's no need for that tag.

21:17.156 --> 21:21.446
Randall McKenna is in critical condition
at Mercy General.

21:21.446 --> 21:23.271
- What happened?
- According to Munch...

21:23.271 --> 21:27.463
cerebral hemorrhage due to
blunt force trauma.

21:27.463 --> 21:29.642
Somebody beat the hell out of him.

21:32.178 --> 21:34.311
Apartment of Denny Corea
860 West 118th Street
Wednesday, November 22

21:34.311 --> 21:37.326
I haven't seen Denny since yesterday.

21:37.326 --> 21:39.686
He's usually working

21:39.686 --> 21:43.617
or looking after that sweet little girl of his.

21:43.617 --> 21:46.394
Did he seem upset or agitated
when you saw him?

21:46.394 --> 21:47.719
Huh?

21:47.719 --> 21:49.364
Did he seem upset?

21:49.364 --> 21:52.395
You don't have to shout.

21:57.267 --> 21:59.682
He was worried about his daughter.

21:59.682 --> 22:03.946
He said her mother married a bad man.

22:03.946 --> 22:05.645
Is Denny in trouble?

22:05.645 --> 22:08.497
That's what we're trying
to find out, Mrs. Fergus.

22:30.689 --> 22:32.098
Yeah?

22:38.309 --> 22:39.347
That was Benson.

22:39.347 --> 22:43.392
They picked up Denny trying to sneak
into the hospital to see his daughter.

22:43.392 --> 22:46.090
Hope he said his goodbyes.

22:47.965 --> 22:50.773
A bloody T-shirt and a witness who
puts you at the scene.

22:50.773 --> 22:55.281
Not to mention a set of knuckles
looks like you've been shadow boxing
with a concrete wall.

22:55.281 --> 22:58.397
We can wait for Randall
to regain consciousness

22:58.397 --> 23:02.424
but we thought you might want us
to hear your side of the story first.

23:03.865 --> 23:06.232
I didn't mean to hurt him.

23:06.832 --> 23:08.917
Okay. Go on.

23:10.477 --> 23:12.411
Friday's the deadline...

23:12.411 --> 23:16.692
he set for signing the custody papers.

23:20.063 --> 23:22.872
I couldn't hand my daughter over...

23:22.872 --> 23:26.503
to the man who was molesting her.

23:28.012 --> 23:32.096
Jamie said I broke the deal...

23:32.398 --> 23:34.146
and Randall was pressing charges.

23:34.146 --> 23:36.597
- For the assault.
- Yes.

23:36.597 --> 23:41.412
I went to his office to see if we can talk.

23:41.412 --> 23:44.985
But the guard stopped me at the lobby.

23:44.985 --> 23:49.015
So I waited for him by the car.

23:49.015 --> 23:50.855
For how long?

23:52.915 --> 23:56.104
He didn't come out till almost midnight.

23:56.304 --> 23:58.512
When he saw me...

23:58.689 --> 24:00.908
he started yelling...

24:01.070 --> 24:03.802
saying that if I didn't leave him alone...

24:03.802 --> 24:07.323
he was gonna charge me
with harassment.

24:07.323 --> 24:09.400
What did you do?

24:09.400 --> 24:12.847
I begged him not to do this.

24:14.036 --> 24:18.696
I mean, with my record, you know,
I could be deported.

24:18.696 --> 24:21.115
So, he listen?

24:22.453 --> 24:24.853
He laughed.

24:25.149 --> 24:28.114
He said that Jamie's mother...

24:28.114 --> 24:31.090
knew people at the State Department.

24:31.090 --> 24:34.210
That I was already as good as gone.

24:34.210 --> 24:36.429
And then what?

24:37.358 --> 24:40.417
Next thing I know...

24:42.735 --> 24:45.804
I was on top of him...

24:45.804 --> 24:49.589
hitting him again and again...

24:50.773 --> 24:54.448
until I realized that...

24:54.448 --> 24:58.062
he wasn't moving anymore.

24:59.630 --> 25:04.189
I found a pay phone, I called 911.

25:04.189 --> 25:06.382
I went home.

25:09.532 --> 25:12.957
And I changed my clothes.

25:18.740 --> 25:23.445
I wanted to see my daughter
just one more time, you know?

25:23.445 --> 25:28.222
Before I turned myself in.

25:30.503 --> 25:32.666
So.

25:34.340 --> 25:36.951
What happens now?

25:36.951 --> 25:38.779
It's hard to say.

25:38.779 --> 25:42.303
You did a real number on him, Denny.

25:42.715 --> 25:46.680
No worse than what he did to my baby.

25:46.680 --> 25:49.612
He should have
let the system work for him.

25:49.612 --> 25:52.349
His experience with the system hasn't
exactly been encouraging.

25:52.349 --> 25:54.143
Hardly an excuse.

25:54.143 --> 25:56.160
I'm just saying,
"What if it was your kid?"

25:56.160 --> 25:58.919
Okay. Thanks.
That was the lab.

25:58.919 --> 26:00.644
We got a make on the nylon bristle.

26:00.644 --> 26:04.369
Traced it to a plant in Akron
that manufactures hairbrushes.

26:04.369 --> 26:07.067
So that hair sample in the rape kit
came from a brush?

26:07.067 --> 26:08.793
And it doesn't belong to Randall.

26:08.793 --> 26:10.688
DNA doesn't match.

26:10.688 --> 26:12.610
Denny stomped the wrong guy.

26:12.610 --> 26:14.316
He was in the right neighborhood.

26:14.316 --> 26:18.153
Preliminary analysis tagged someone
in Randall's bloodline.

26:18.358 --> 26:20.545
McKenna Residence
660 West 84th Street
Wednesday, November 22

26:20.545 --> 26:22.305
I don't understand.

26:22.305 --> 26:25.018
I know. I'm sorry, Jamie
but these detectives have a job to do.

26:25.018 --> 26:27.407
But we're the victims here.
My husband, my daughter.

26:27.407 --> 26:29.808
- Haven't we suffered enough?
- Yes, and I know it's hard.

26:29.808 --> 26:32.603
But why don't we just go downstairs
for a minute. Okay?

27:13.354 --> 27:16.458
Hey, what the hell are you doing?
That's mine.

27:17.893 --> 27:18.995
None of this would be happening

27:18.995 --> 27:21.472
if that bitch hadn't sucked my dad
into her crappy life.

27:21.472 --> 27:22.712
That go for Emily, too?

27:22.712 --> 27:24.087
All she does is cry.

27:24.087 --> 27:26.649
- I bet that gets on your nerves?
- Damn straight.

27:26.649 --> 27:28.911
- That why you let her have it?
- Have what?

27:28.911 --> 27:30.709
Come on, Justin, we know you hurt her.

27:30.709 --> 27:31.779
I didn't touch her.

27:31.779 --> 27:34.085
- Well, then, who did?
- I don't know. Maybe she did.

27:34.085 --> 27:35.848
- Who is she?
- The bitch.

27:35.848 --> 27:36.949
With your hairbrush?

27:36.949 --> 27:39.446
All I know is, everything was fine
until she showed up.

27:39.446 --> 27:40.668
Now it all sucks.

27:40.668 --> 27:43.942
Why can't they both just go away
and leave us alone?

27:44.129 --> 27:46.984
Sometimes I'd come home to find her
in her room crying,

27:46.984 --> 27:50.615
and Justin just standing there watching.

27:50.615 --> 27:52.885
I knew he resented the attention
Randall gave her

27:52.885 --> 27:56.375
but I never dreamed he was hurting her.

27:56.375 --> 28:00.522
He said that you and Randall
argued about her.

28:00.522 --> 28:04.864
If we argued at all, it was about
Justin's attitude toward Emily.

28:05.446 --> 28:09.445
Was Justin alone with her the night
she was injured?

28:09.744 --> 28:11.337
After I put Emily to bed,

28:11.337 --> 28:15.820
I took Michael to the drug store
to refill his asthma medication.

28:15.820 --> 28:20.517
The line was so long,
it took us an hour to get home.

28:20.517 --> 28:22.169
And where was your husband?

28:22.169 --> 28:26.718
At the office.
He didn't come home until late.

28:27.539 --> 28:31.080
I looked in on her before I went to bed.

28:31.080 --> 28:33.780
She looked so peaceful.

28:34.018 --> 28:36.728
I thought she was sleeping.

28:40.294 --> 28:43.340
How could I be so blind?

28:44.409 --> 28:48.225
The lab scored a direct DNA
hit with the hair from Justin's brush.

28:48.225 --> 28:50.983
Could explain why his father
didn't want to give a sample.

28:50.983 --> 28:52.080
Why? Do you think he knew?

28:52.080 --> 28:53.777
Might have suspected.

28:53.777 --> 28:55.543
Where are we with the boy?

28:55.543 --> 28:58.250
He's one angry kid,
but he isn't ready to give it up.

28:58.250 --> 29:00.146
What do you say we toss him
in a cell for a while

29:00.146 --> 29:03.239
see if that doesn't take the edge off?

29:10.280 --> 29:12.205
Are you sure
there's nothing else I can do?

29:12.205 --> 29:13.984
I can write out my statement,
if you'd like.

29:13.984 --> 29:15.781
No, that's all right.
We've got it all on tape

29:15.781 --> 29:18.378
and we can take care of
the paperwork in the morning.

29:18.378 --> 29:19.933
Okay. Thank you.

29:21.735 --> 29:23.899
- Good night.
- Good night.

29:25.982 --> 29:28.589
She seems almost disappointed.

29:29.544 --> 29:32.431
Her husband may never walk,
her daughter's in a coma

29:32.431 --> 29:35.414
her stepson is going to jail...

29:35.414 --> 29:37.831
and her ex-boyfriend's facing deportation.

29:37.831 --> 29:41.637
She's not disappointed, Munch.
She's numb.

29:43.172 --> 29:45.564
You don't look convinced.

29:45.564 --> 29:47.198
It's the small things.
For example,

29:47.198 --> 29:49.434
if Emily had been showing
abuse symptoms for months

29:49.434 --> 29:51.979
how come we haven't turned up
a single hospital record?

29:51.979 --> 29:53.775
Then there's this.

29:54.815 --> 29:57.217
It's an interesting idea for a key chain.

29:57.217 --> 30:00.315
- Found it in Emily's room.
- Who's Erica Smith?

30:00.315 --> 30:03.542
Nobody at Emily's school or
dance class has any idea.

30:03.542 --> 30:05.034
Think there's something to it?

30:05.034 --> 30:06.917
One way to find out.

30:07.647 --> 30:11.495
Hudson Free Clinic
107 West 97th Street
Thursday, November 23

30:12.042 --> 30:13.688
There it is, Erica Smith,

30:13.688 --> 30:16.338
admitted on May 20th
complaining of vaginal bleeding.

30:16.338 --> 30:18.399
A day before the school filed
its abuse report.

30:18.399 --> 30:21.560
The attending prescribed an antibacterial
ointment and the girl was sent home.

30:21.560 --> 30:23.209
Didn't anyone here suspect abuse?

30:23.209 --> 30:26.763
The ACS was notified, but we never heard
from the mother or the agency again.

30:26.763 --> 30:29.111
- You got a home address?
- Yeah. Right there.

30:30.115 --> 30:32.877
If that's her address, she's living
in the middle of the East River.

30:32.877 --> 30:35.614
- You thinking what I'm thinking?
- We've been had.

30:40.370 --> 30:42.526
We checked the X-rays and blood type
from the medical records

30:42.526 --> 30:44.724
against Emily's,
and they're one and the same.

30:44.724 --> 30:47.976
We also found matches at four
separate clinics and hospitals.

30:47.976 --> 30:50.838
In each case, she used
a different alias and paid in cash

30:50.838 --> 30:52.352
so there'd be no paper trail.

30:52.352 --> 30:55.049
She could have been covering
for her husband. / Or Justin.

30:55.049 --> 30:58.256
We've been assuming the attacker
is male because of the sexual abuse.

30:58.256 --> 31:00.306
But suppose it was Jamie all along.

31:00.306 --> 31:02.955
It's possible these injuries
aren't even sexual.

31:02.955 --> 31:04.509
It's an interesting tactic.

31:04.509 --> 31:06.755
Abuse the kid, pin it on the ex...

31:06.755 --> 31:09.432
Dad goes to jail, Mom wins
custody by default.

31:09.432 --> 31:12.095
And if her daughter dies in the process?

31:12.095 --> 31:13.351
Bonus.

31:13.351 --> 31:14.339
Excuse me?

31:14.339 --> 31:16.275
The kid is nothing more than
a means to an end.

31:16.275 --> 31:17.475
Which is?

31:17.475 --> 31:18.606
Attention.

31:18.606 --> 31:19.977
Sympathy.

31:19.977 --> 31:21.192
Love.

31:21.192 --> 31:22.799
People who've suffered abuse
in childhood

31:22.799 --> 31:25.163
tend to repeat the pattern
with their own children.

31:25.163 --> 31:27.293
This is an extreme case
because of the rage.

31:27.293 --> 31:32.148
But, in the end, she's just wrapping herself
in the warm cloak of victimhood.

31:32.148 --> 31:35.304
Yeah, but if she's looking for sympathy,
why use the aliases?

31:35.304 --> 31:36.970
To control the outcome.

31:36.970 --> 31:40.251
Rape kit analysis would have
excluded Denny from the get-go.

31:40.251 --> 31:42.198
Leaving her without a scapegoat.

31:42.198 --> 31:44.263
Till Justin showed up.

31:44.449 --> 31:46.488
Justin, we know this is a pain
in the ass for you.

31:46.488 --> 31:48.953
Just meet us halfway,
maybe we can help you out.

31:48.953 --> 31:50.018
Whatever.

31:50.018 --> 31:52.002
You said that you didn't
hurt your stepsister.

31:52.002 --> 31:53.980
- I didn't.
- But your stepmother said...

31:53.980 --> 31:56.616
that you were the only one that
was alone with her that night.

31:56.616 --> 31:57.973
Yeah, for about two minutes.

31:57.973 --> 31:59.983
But Jamie said
she was gone for an hour.

31:59.983 --> 32:02.010
Maybe she was.

32:02.488 --> 32:05.953
All right, that's enough.
Enough. Sit down.

32:06.837 --> 32:08.090
Very clearly,

32:08.090 --> 32:12.259
we are trying to get you out of here.

32:12.259 --> 32:14.785
You understand that?
Now, you keep talking in circles,

32:14.785 --> 32:18.191
you're gonna be spending
your varsity years behind bars.

32:18.191 --> 32:19.929
Look, I don't know
how long she was gone.

32:19.929 --> 32:22.404
All I know is, once she was out the door,
I took off.

32:22.404 --> 32:23.966
Where did you go?

32:23.966 --> 32:25.974
I was bored as hell,
so I went for a run in the park.

32:25.974 --> 32:27.120
Okay. Where?

32:27.120 --> 32:29.733
Down the ice rink over
the baseball diamonds, and back.

32:29.733 --> 32:30.988
Anybody see you?

32:30.988 --> 32:33.420
I'm sure they did,
but I didn't take names.

32:33.420 --> 32:35.052
How long were you gone?

32:35.052 --> 32:36.848
I don't know. An hour.

32:36.848 --> 32:38.677
Was your stepmother there
when you got home?

32:38.677 --> 32:40.709
Chewed me out for leaving that brat alone.

32:40.709 --> 32:43.902
I mean, the kid was asleep.
What difference did it make?

32:43.902 --> 32:47.338
If he's telling the truth Jamie could have
hurt the girl before he got home.

32:47.338 --> 32:49.292
Without proof,
it's just more finger-pointing.

32:49.292 --> 32:51.138
We need corroborating testimony.

32:51.138 --> 32:54.443
Too bad our only other witnesses
are either mute or in a coma.

32:54.443 --> 32:57.533
What about the druggist?
Jamie said that she went to fill a prescription.

32:57.533 --> 33:00.079
She didn't give a name,
but if the kid's got a chronic condition

33:00.079 --> 33:01.936
maybe she has an account
in the neighborhood.

33:01.936 --> 33:04.407
Well, that's a start.
But we need someone closer to home.

33:04.407 --> 33:06.249
Well, the neighbors were not helpful.

33:06.249 --> 33:09.845
What about that nosey doorman that jacked
us when we served the search warrant?

33:09.845 --> 33:13.578
He said that he didn't see anything
out of the ordinary.

33:13.758 --> 33:16.481
Maybe you didn't ask the right questions.

33:18.221 --> 33:20.731
First the little girl, then her husband.

33:20.731 --> 33:22.335
My heart goes out to her.

33:22.335 --> 33:25.699
Do you remember seeing Jamie heading
out with her four-year-old on Sunday night?

33:25.699 --> 33:28.472
Come to think of it
kid was breathing heavy.

33:28.472 --> 33:29.821
He's got asthma, you know.

33:29.821 --> 33:33.016
I offered to flag a cab, but she said
they were just going down the block.

33:33.016 --> 33:34.153
How about the older boy?

33:34.153 --> 33:35.305
Justin? / Yeah.

33:35.305 --> 33:36.942
That one's got an attitude.

33:36.942 --> 33:39.854
Came storming out right after Jamie
toward the park.

33:39.854 --> 33:42.537
Told him it ain't safe for a kid after dark
but would he listen?

33:42.537 --> 33:43.777
You got a time?

33:43.777 --> 33:47.100
Around 9:00. I was just
about to take my break.

33:47.406 --> 33:49.764
And do you remember
what time Jamie got back?

33:49.764 --> 33:50.783
Didn't see her.

33:50.783 --> 33:52.979
But she could've walked in
while I was taking a powder.

33:52.979 --> 33:54.752
Excuse me.
Where's Fin?

33:54.752 --> 33:57.435
- We split up to cover more ground.
- You find the drugstore?

33:57.435 --> 33:59.112
Pharmacist checked Jamie's receipt.

33:59.112 --> 34:02.025
It was time-coded 9:09 p.m.,
after closing.

34:02.025 --> 34:04.107
But she called and made
such a stink that he waited for her.

34:04.107 --> 34:06.011
He said she was in and out
in five minutes.

34:06.011 --> 34:07.797
How far a walk?

34:07.797 --> 34:09.716
Five minutes.
Ten minutes with a kid in tow.

34:09.716 --> 34:12.340
That puts her back here 9:20, 9:30.

34:12.340 --> 34:13.621
What you learn from the doorman?

34:13.621 --> 34:16.876
Couldn't place Jamie, but remembers
Justin getting back after 10:00.

34:16.876 --> 34:19.560
Plenty of time to do serious damage.

34:20.396 --> 34:21.523
You're circling the building

34:21.523 --> 34:24.641
but unless you place her in the apartment
at the time of the assault

34:24.641 --> 34:25.880
you don't have a case.

34:25.880 --> 34:27.789
What about the hospital fraud?

34:27.789 --> 34:29.717
Well, it's not fraud if she paid the bills.

34:29.717 --> 34:31.637
Consciousness of guilt?

34:31.637 --> 34:34.909
Even if you can prove Jamie was the one
who took Emily to those facilities,

34:34.909 --> 34:37.096
you can't bootstrap
aggravated child abuse

34:37.096 --> 34:39.993
to her conduct without
a more definitive causal link.

34:39.993 --> 34:43.601
You remember how Skoda said
Jamie has this need for attention?

34:43.601 --> 34:45.167
Well, I gave her my pager number

34:45.167 --> 34:46.984
in case she needed somebody to talk to...

34:46.984 --> 34:48.739
and guess who's been paging me?

34:48.739 --> 34:50.273
She's feeling needy.

34:50.273 --> 34:53.005
If Skoda's right,
it's more than need.

34:53.005 --> 34:55.431
I think she's jonesing for a sympathy fix.

34:55.431 --> 34:57.507
And what do you propose?

34:57.507 --> 34:59.221
Feed the junkie.

35:02.884 --> 35:04.901
Thanks for coming down.

35:06.900 --> 35:10.406
I just want to help in whatever way I can.

35:10.406 --> 35:13.490
As you know, we're holding Justin
until he can be arraigned...

35:13.490 --> 35:17.123
and then we'll release him
into your custody...

35:17.655 --> 35:20.022
assuming you want to take him.

35:20.214 --> 35:21.982
I don't know.

35:21.982 --> 35:26.193
He scares me. I'm sure he just hurt
Emily to get back at me.

35:26.193 --> 35:29.756
Must be hard to be an outcast
in your own house.

35:29.756 --> 35:31.295
You don't know the half of it.

35:31.295 --> 35:32.993
Actually, I do.

35:40.865 --> 35:43.354
This is my file.

35:44.278 --> 35:46.393
I thought it was sealed.

35:46.393 --> 35:49.324
I have a friend in Children's Services.

35:49.324 --> 35:50.786
She remembered you.

35:50.786 --> 35:52.503
How?

35:53.189 --> 35:57.418
She remembered how nervous her superiors
were about investigating an ambassador

35:57.418 --> 36:01.617
for sexually abusing his
11-year-old daughter.

36:01.617 --> 36:04.781
It must have been
a very painful time for you.

36:05.212 --> 36:07.245
Yes, it was.

36:07.245 --> 36:09.528
How did your mother take it?

36:11.171 --> 36:15.430
She was jealous, because
Daddy couldn't stand to touch her.

36:15.718 --> 36:20.180
So she sent me away to boarding school.
I begged her not to but

36:20.180 --> 36:24.503
what Mother wants, Mother gets.

36:24.503 --> 36:27.108
She abandoned you, Jamie.

36:28.221 --> 36:29.737
I survived.

36:29.737 --> 36:34.564
But still. Must be hard facing that kind
of rejection from your own daughter.

36:34.564 --> 36:36.904
What do you mean?

36:37.056 --> 36:40.279
Emily came out of her coma
a few hours ago.

36:40.279 --> 36:43.035
She told us everything.

36:43.035 --> 36:45.591
She wants to see you.

36:46.509 --> 36:51.675
But first you and I have a couple of details
we need to straighten out.

36:53.168 --> 36:55.432
What details?

36:56.049 --> 36:59.548
- Let's start with the hairbrush.
- It's Justin's.

36:59.548 --> 37:02.443
Yes, but we got a partial print...

37:02.443 --> 37:05.942
- and with Emily's testimony...
- Emily's a liar.

37:06.684 --> 37:11.778
- Now why would she lie?
- Her father poisoned her against me.

37:12.547 --> 37:17.463
It's been very painful, very hurtful.

37:19.186 --> 37:21.124
I know, Jamie.

37:21.640 --> 37:24.712
Been carrying the pain long enough.

37:25.059 --> 37:27.981
Just tell me your side of the story

37:27.981 --> 37:30.955
and you can start to heal.

37:37.990 --> 37:42.673
We were driving home and
she wouldn't stop crying

37:43.265 --> 37:48.416
so I pulled over to try and talk to her.

37:48.683 --> 37:54.248
But when she told me she and her daddy
were leaving me forever...

37:54.916 --> 37:58.666
I pulled her out of the car and
she hit her head on the curb.

37:58.666 --> 38:01.262
- How?
- She fell.

38:01.262 --> 38:02.957
Come on, Jamie.

38:07.043 --> 38:09.821
I didn't shove her hard.

38:09.821 --> 38:12.427
I just wanted her to stop whining...

38:12.427 --> 38:14.059
so I could talk to her.

38:14.059 --> 38:16.400
Did that stop her?

38:16.900 --> 38:21.159
It was the first time
she was quiet all day.

38:21.680 --> 38:24.277
And she was sleepy.

38:24.277 --> 38:29.923
So when I got home, I put her to bed and
Michael and I went to the drugstore.

38:31.020 --> 38:34.274
But when we came back...

38:34.274 --> 38:37.864
she was crying again.

38:38.027 --> 38:39.697
I told her...

38:39.697 --> 38:43.664
how important it was for her
to be a good girl...

38:43.664 --> 38:48.099
so that her new daddy could love her,
too, but she wouldn't stop.

38:48.730 --> 38:52.135
It was like she was doing it to spite me.

38:52.135 --> 38:53.935
Is that why you used the hairbrush?

38:53.935 --> 38:55.592
I had to teach her discipline.

38:55.592 --> 38:58.040
My mother used a hairbrush to teach me

38:58.040 --> 39:03.458
but Emily just kept screaming louder and
louder, what was I supposed to do?

39:03.664 --> 39:06.395
The only thing you could do.

39:11.393 --> 39:15.110
I threw her against the wall.

39:15.361 --> 39:17.716
Then what?

39:19.989 --> 39:24.413
She finally stopped.

39:28.950 --> 39:32.245
And then I tucked her into bed
kissed her on her cheek,

39:32.245 --> 39:36.170
and then I told her I loved her.

39:40.041 --> 39:43.915
I just wanted her to stop crying.

39:45.915 --> 39:49.147
Was that too much to ask?

40:11.891 --> 40:13.689
It's good work, John.

40:32.627 --> 40:37.193
Took a chance with that bluff about Emily
coming out of her coma.

40:37.411 --> 40:42.034
I'm not sure what we would have done
if Jamie had pressed to see her.

40:44.833 --> 40:47.595
She didn't care about the kids.

40:49.219 --> 40:51.232
How did you know?

40:52.239 --> 40:53.969
We searched her house...

40:53.969 --> 40:56.821
I looked at that four-year-old...

40:57.013 --> 40:59.800
flashed on a little girl that used to live
across the street from us

40:59.800 --> 41:03.183
in our old neighborhood
on the Lower East Side.

41:03.183 --> 41:06.167
She had that same look in her eyes.

41:06.540 --> 41:08.280
What look?

41:08.280 --> 41:11.468
Sad, lost.

41:14.219 --> 41:19.289
She used to stand on her porch every
afternoon when I came home from school.

41:19.289 --> 41:21.805
Like she was waiting for me.

41:21.805 --> 41:27.326
Sometimes, she'd have
a black eye or a bloody lip.

41:29.029 --> 41:30.577
Never said anything to me.

41:30.577 --> 41:33.949
Just looked at me like
she was trying to tell me something.

41:33.949 --> 41:38.825
But I was too full of my own teenage crap
to pay any attention.

41:39.308 --> 41:42.346
One day, I came home...

41:43.067 --> 41:45.560
she wasn't there.

41:47.349 --> 41:52.050
Found out her mother threw her through
a plate glass window.

41:53.994 --> 41:56.822
Went to the funeral.

41:57.000 --> 41:59.922
Saw her dad.

42:00.866 --> 42:04.897
It's the first time I saw a grown man cry.

42:05.950 --> 42:09.037
What happened to her mother?

42:09.037 --> 42:12.004
They sent her to a sanitarium.

42:12.004 --> 42:13.544
She told my mother...

42:13.544 --> 42:16.024
she didn't understand what
all the fuss was about.

42:16.024 --> 42:19.930
She was the one that had to
get a new window.

42:26.817 --> 42:30.014
Months later, I'd come home...

42:31.026 --> 42:35.000
and I'd look up at the porch.

42:35.301 --> 42:40.872
I swear, I saw that little girl standing there,
looking at me with that look.

42:46.889 --> 42:49.814
I almost let her down again.
