00:07.094 --> 00:09.094
You have destroyed everything.

00:15.424 --> 00:18.337
We've managed to harvest and
fertilize very impressive embryos.

00:19.928 --> 00:21.928
- You dont't send her back?
- Back?

00:22.014 --> 00:23.902
To her home, her dimension.

00:23.956 --> 00:25.956
You go in there armed
and it'll be carnage.

00:26.443 --> 00:27.702
It's the idea.

00:27.742 --> 00:29.969
- 30 Millions.
- And what do you want in return?

00:30.003 --> 00:32.003
Your brother.

00:40.613 --> 00:41.912
<i>All right, fellas,</i>

00:42.248 --> 00:44.681

<i>Get over here.</i>

01:01.867 --> 01:04.568
<i>You, come here. I need to talk to you.</i>

01:06.038 --> 01:07.604
Latani, we need to go.

01:07.773 --> 01:08.639
Oi!

01:14.947 --> 01:16.847
You ever shot one of these?

Boy or girl?

02:40.540 --> 02:43.033
What's your professional opinion?

02:44.637 --> 02:47.404
I don't really care
as long as it's healthy.

02:47.640 --> 02:49.439
I'd say that's healthy.

02:49.675 --> 02:52.226
Just feels a bit tight.

02:52.400 --> 02:54.148
It's natural for you to feel worried

02:54.173 --> 02:55.238
considering our history.

02:55.347 --> 02:57.512
I'm not being a paranoid pregnant woman.

02:57.592 --> 02:59.825
I'm just saying it as a doctor.

03:01.095 --> 03:02.628
You've never been pregnant before.

03:02.897 --> 03:05.665
Look, you found the top IVF clinic.

03:05.900 --> 03:07.458
We're both fit and healthy.

03:08.381 --> 03:09.247
Yeah.

03:10.571 --> 03:12.205
Yeah, I'm sure you're right.

03:18.313 --> 03:19.444
You off to work?

03:20.114 --> 03:22.091
Uh, no, I've got the day off,

03:22.116 --> 03:24.617
so I thought I might go shopping.

03:24.786 --> 03:25.718
Shopping?

03:25.847 --> 03:28.721
Yeah, not for the baby or anything.

03:29.057 --> 03:31.343
<i>I'm not going to look at
little baby clothes or cots.</i>

03:31.368 --> 03:32.230
No.

03:33.962 --> 03:36.495
Well, have fun not doing
any of those things.

04:00.321 --> 04:01.787
Can you pull this off?

04:03.458 --> 04:05.291
Only one way to find out.

04:12.066 --> 04:16.435
Take Ash to somewhere beautiful for me.

04:45.500 --> 04:48.134
<i>I am the Cleverman.</i>

04:51.906 --> 04:54.173
<i>I am the Cleverman.</i>

05:21.669 --> 05:25.571
Oi, I want you out.

05:25.873 --> 05:27.907
- Nerida.
- No, you heard what I said.

05:28.109 --> 05:29.607
I want you gone.

05:31.479 --> 05:32.778
Can we at least talk about this?

05:33.495 --> 05:34.947
There's nothing to say.

05:36.150 --> 05:37.416
<i>Nerida, please.</i>

05:49.897 --> 05:52.298
<i>This redevelopment
deal really gonna happen?</i>

05:52.633 --> 05:55.401
If the numbers crunch
our way, just might.

05:55.670 --> 05:56.802
<i>It's looking pretty good.</i>

05:57.105 --> 05:58.637
So everyone in the Zone
gets their own place?

05:58.840 --> 05:59.872
<i>That's the idea.</i>

05:59.978 --> 06:01.818
- Latani, too?
- Everyone.

06:02.310 --> 06:03.723
<i>Cool, huh?</i>

06:14.288 --> 06:17.056
<i> Oh!</i>

06:19.594 --> 06:21.460
<i>No, no, no, no.</i>

06:21.696 --> 06:23.829
Hey.

06:24.098 --> 06:25.865
What is it? Hey, what happened?

06:26.100 --> 06:28.234
What happened? Nerida?

06:28.503 --> 06:30.269
I'm here. Calm down, calm down.

06:30.505 --> 06:32.471
It's okay. Calm down.

06:32.707 --> 06:35.074
That's it. Calm down.

06:35.309 --> 06:37.935
<i>It's Waruu.</i>

06:38.779 --> 06:40.918
<i>I just don't know who he is anymore.</i>

06:41.549 --> 06:43.535
I'm so sorry.

07:09.110 --> 07:11.010
Ilythia Clinic.

07:13.948 --> 07:16.515
<i> Sorry, the number you
requested is not available.</i>

07:16.817 --> 07:19.137
<i>Please check the number</i>
<i>before dialing again.</i>

07:30.698 --> 07:31.639
Oi!

07:33.634 --> 07:34.767
Look at me.

07:36.229 --> 07:37.125
You want money?

07:38.498 --> 07:40.172
Here. Knock yourself out.

07:40.441 --> 07:42.192
Oh, growing on trees now, is it?

07:44.178 --> 07:46.111
Yeah, Jimmy saw it in you.

07:46.576 --> 07:48.214
The jeals one.

07:48.416 --> 07:49.962
The corruptible.

07:50.647 --> 07:51.730
The crow.

07:56.490 --> 07:59.091
You're the one that named me Waruu.

07:59.293 --> 08:00.192
I didn't choose it.

08:00.461 --> 08:02.241
You can choose how you behave.

08:02.997 --> 08:04.230
I'm trying to build something here...

08:04.465 --> 08:06.966
a future for my people.

08:07.201 --> 08:08.601
That's what I'm doing,

08:08.869 --> 08:10.636
not smoking myself to death.

08:10.871 --> 08:13.193
You want all this so bad?

08:13.774 --> 08:16.201
You're prepared to sacrifice
your own brother.

08:16.677 --> 08:19.789
None of this is his fault.
He was born into it.

08:19.814 --> 08:21.814
- Still trying to protect him.
- I'm worried about you.

08:21.883 --> 08:22.956
Well, that's a first.

08:23.130 --> 08:24.503
You were never there.

08:25.186 --> 08:27.620
You didn't raise me.
You were too stoned.

08:27.989 --> 08:30.289
When you did have your shit
together, you looked after Koen.

08:30.491 --> 08:31.357
He's not even your son.

08:31.559 --> 08:32.886
I'm your son.

08:34.895 --> 08:36.227
You loved him because you felt so guilty

08:36.429 --> 08:37.663
about what you did.

08:37.898 --> 08:39.486
I had to look out for myself.

08:40.067 --> 08:42.101
You point the finger at me?

08:43.437 --> 08:45.134
You killed my father.

08:46.079 --> 08:47.706
You crashed the car.

08:47.942 --> 08:49.241
If you weren't high that night,

08:49.510 --> 08:51.350
my father would still be alive.

08:52.113 --> 08:55.447
You got away with murder
and you call me the crow?

08:57.005 --> 08:58.954
You're the reason I'm not the Cleverman.

09:00.054 --> 09:01.820
You're the reason I'm the way I am.

09:02.089 --> 09:04.216
You're the reason
all this shit happened.

09:04.959 --> 09:06.225
If Dad were still alive,

09:06.274 --> 09:08.394
I wouldn't have to sacrifice anyone.

09:10.298 --> 09:11.835
It's not too late for you.

09:14.842 --> 09:15.999
Please.

09:17.443 --> 09:19.380
Waruu, whatever you've been promised,

09:21.046 --> 09:22.524
<i>it's not worth killing for.</i>

09:25.050 --> 09:26.716
I'm glad you've got cancer.

09:41.199 --> 09:42.199
<i>Coming up...</i>

09:48.107 --> 09:50.546
<i>Stay tuned for more "Cleverman".</i>

09:59.564 --> 10:02.032
Don't need sticks
when you've got guns, eh?

10:02.301 --> 10:03.333
<i>All humans of the Zone,</i>

10:03.569 --> 10:05.936
<i>you have 24 hours to vacate.</i>

10:06.084 --> 10:08.792
<i>Please proceed to the
checkpoint immediately.</i>

10:09.404 --> 10:10.970
<i>The Containment Authority</i>
<i>can no longer...</i>

10:11.239 --> 10:14.207
- Maliyan!
- <i> ...guarantee your safety.</i>

10:15.977 --> 10:18.016
<i> This is not a drill.</i>

10:18.947 --> 10:21.614
<i>All humans of the Zone,</i>

10:21.883 --> 10:24.351
<i>you have 24 hours to vacate.</i>

10:24.686 --> 10:27.787
<i>Please proceed to the
checkpoint immediately.</i>

10:28.190 --> 10:31.024
<i>Containment Authority officers will
assist you in your relocation.</i>

10:31.293 --> 10:34.260
You've gotta go, boy. Get out.

10:36.031 --> 10:37.353
I said, get out.

10:38.200 --> 10:39.332
Get out!

10:49.681 --> 10:51.444
This morning I officially
signed the orders

10:51.747 --> 10:53.580
requiring all humans to vacate the area

10:53.849 --> 10:55.782
commonly referred to as the Zone.

10:56.017 --> 10:57.317
<i>The Zone is a safe haven</i>

10:57.619 --> 10:59.119
<i>for murderers and violent criminals</i>

10:59.321 --> 11:00.787
who refuse to assimilate,

11:01.089 --> 11:02.756
and we're going to dismantle that haven.

11:03.058 --> 11:05.625
Our citizens expect
to feel safe in the streets.

11:05.927 --> 11:07.594
<i>People do not want</i>
<i>to fear for their lives.</i>

11:07.863 --> 11:09.229
They're going to clean the place out.

11:09.531 --> 11:10.964
<i>It's been on the cards for a while now.</i>

11:11.133 --> 11:12.049
What?

11:12.324 --> 11:14.968
Kill the Hairies and chuck
everyone else out on the street?

11:15.237 --> 11:16.636
Who does Matthews think he is?

11:16.872 --> 11:17.871
He wants what you want.

11:18.482 --> 11:20.106
<i>There are international consortia</i>

11:20.375 --> 11:22.008
lining up to redevelop the Zone.

11:22.377 --> 11:24.677
Matthews has been working behind
the scenes to make this happen.

11:24.980 --> 11:26.579
Cleaning out the Zone is the first step.

11:26.848 --> 11:27.947
Yeah, cleaning it out of people.

11:28.250 --> 11:31.117
We both know his scheme
is never gonna happen.

11:31.453 --> 11:34.131
You have the money and the
right to first development

11:34.156 --> 11:35.455
as original occupants of the land.

11:35.657 --> 11:36.923
Well, that's bullshit.

11:37.259 --> 11:40.126
The whole place is gonna be
razed in the next 24 hours.

11:40.495 --> 11:41.524
Don't worry about Matthews.

11:41.549 --> 11:43.389
He's the minister,
the one with the power.

11:43.465 --> 11:44.998
We'll get screwed
like we always get screwed.

11:45.233 --> 11:46.866
I have cameras everywhere,

11:47.169 --> 11:49.702
so I don't think he'll be
minister for much longer.

11:50.705 --> 11:53.139
Here's what you need to take
the power from Matthews.

11:55.477 --> 11:57.477
You have the money now.

11:57.712 --> 11:59.746
You can help your people,

12:00.663 --> 12:04.584
but I'll need you to deliver
the collateral for the loan.

12:05.095 --> 12:06.753
I want your brother.

12:12.060 --> 12:13.993
<i>All humans of the Zone,</i>

12:14.262 --> 12:16.696
<i>you have 24 hours to vacate.</i>

12:16.868 --> 12:19.432
<i>Please proceed to the

12:19.668 --> 12:21.367
<i>The Containment Authority</i>

12:21.670 --> 12:24.270
<i>can no longer guarantee your safety.</i>

12:37.652 --> 12:38.950
Yeah.

12:39.621 --> 12:41.286
Yeah, we have moved up the time frame.

12:42.547 --> 12:44.390
The land should be clear
by the end of the week.

12:48.063 --> 12:50.129
God!

12:50.298 --> 12:51.598
Good.

12:51.900 --> 12:54.067
<i>No, I'm fine.</i>
<i>I'll speak to you tomorrow.</i>

13:06.715 --> 13:08.014
Come on, Alinta. Hurry up.

13:08.350 --> 13:10.216
- You can't be serious.
- We've talked about this.

13:10.552 --> 13:12.051
Just 'cause Dad's acting
like family is nothing...

13:12.287 --> 13:13.086
This is not about your father.

13:13.288 --> 13:14.615
Latani's family!

13:15.423 --> 13:16.823
You're gonna need a coat.

13:17.025 --> 13:18.124
I'm not leaving her.

13:18.169 --> 13:19.826
You don't understand
what's going on here!

13:23.498 --> 13:25.743
<i>This is not a drill.</i>

13:26.368 --> 13:29.269
<i>All humans of the Zone,</i>
<i>you have 24 hours to vacate.</i>

13:29.471 --> 13:30.870
Your mom's right.

13:31.206 --> 13:34.173
<i>Please proceed to the

13:34.409 --> 13:36.309
<i>All humans of the Zone...</i>

<i>You're a warrior now, brother.</i>

14:06.141 --> 14:07.452
<i>You're one of us.</i>

14:07.876 --> 14:09.204
You're family.

14:09.811 --> 14:13.246
This is how the old people
used to prepare for war.

14:14.382 --> 14:15.548
<i>Not long now.</i>

14:18.053 --> 14:19.886
<i>All humans of the Zone,</i>

14:20.155 --> 14:21.220

14:21.456 --> 14:22.989
<i>IDs out, people.</i>

14:23.258 --> 14:25.228
<i>Subhumans should not be in this line.</i>

14:25.260 --> 14:27.582
<i>Any subhuman in
this line will be detained.</i>

14:27.629 --> 14:30.863
<i>Please proceed to
the checkpoint immediately.</i>

14:33.635 --> 14:35.335
<i>This is not a drill.</i>

14:36.972 --> 14:37.904
<i>Hey!</i>

14:38.106 --> 14:39.205
Hey, clear the line!

14:55.991 --> 14:57.256
<i>Come on, keep it moving.</i>

15:08.970 --> 15:11.304
Oi! We're going now.

15:11.506 --> 15:13.640
Come on, Gub.

15:14.491 --> 15:16.337
<i>We've got to get out of here.</i>

15:17.278 --> 15:18.411
<i>All humans of the Zone...</i>

15:18.647 --> 15:20.413
I'm not gonna bloody beg.

15:23.251 --> 15:26.386
<i>Please proceed to the
checkpoint immediately.</i>

15:26.588 --> 15:28.087
Max, wait!

15:34.663 --> 15:36.262
<i>Latani.</i>

15:42.537 --> 15:43.936
You need to go.

15:46.675 --> 15:48.541
I know what you said to your mom.

15:48.777 --> 15:50.443
This is no place for you.

15:50.679 --> 15:51.844
I won't leave you.

15:52.047 --> 15:53.980
I said go, Alinta.

15:54.182 --> 15:55.281
I'm not leaving you.

15:55.550 --> 15:56.482
We'll make a stand together.

15:56.751 --> 15:57.784
What's that supposed to mean?

15:58.053 --> 16:00.653
This isn't some bullshit
political rally.

16:00.855 --> 16:02.217
This is my life.

16:03.892 --> 16:06.159
- They will kill us.
- I get that.

16:06.227 --> 16:07.881
No, you don't get that.

16:08.434 --> 16:10.102
I don't have a choice.

16:11.066 --> 16:12.582
I can shave down,

16:13.968 --> 16:15.767
but that doesn't mean I'll feel safe.

16:15.912 --> 16:18.448
I will be scared every single day,

16:18.473 --> 16:20.473
wondering if I will be found out.

16:20.534 --> 16:22.575
- Not all humans hate you.
- <i> There's nowhere for me.</i>

16:22.877 --> 16:25.945
I'm alone, so you need to go, Alinta.

16:27.949 --> 16:29.849
- Go!
- No.

16:30.185 --> 16:31.718
I'm fighting for you
whether you like it or not!

16:31.986 --> 16:34.153
I'm not leaving you! Did you hear me?

16:34.456 --> 16:36.417
- No, you need to go!
- I'm not leaving you!

16:36.458 --> 16:38.803
Hey, come with me now, both of you.

16:38.860 --> 16:41.627
- No objections.
- No. Nerida...

16:41.863 --> 16:43.429
I'm not going anywhere.

16:43.665 --> 16:45.131
I'm asking you to trust me.

16:45.794 --> 16:47.026
<i>Please.</i>

16:50.528 --> 16:51.495
<i>Coming up...</i>

16:57.302 --> 17:00.303
<i>Stay tuned for more "Cleverman".</i>

17:20.068 --> 17:22.435
Hey, there's no rush.

17:36.084 --> 17:38.785
_

17:41.456 --> 17:42.455
_

17:45.794 --> 17:49.845
_

17:51.525 --> 17:53.525
_

17:53.638 --> 17:57.639
_

17:59.508 --> 18:01.608
_

18:01.776 --> 18:07.667
_

18:15.790 --> 18:18.525
_

18:20.028 --> 18:24.261
_

18:24.902 --> 18:28.306
_

18:54.029 --> 18:56.663
_

19:00.468 --> 19:03.069
_

19:51.820 --> 19:56.936
_

19:58.108 --> 20:00.108
_

20:37.299 --> 20:39.799
Doesn't leave much to the imagination.

20:40.035 --> 20:41.634
This will destroy Matthews.

20:41.903 --> 20:43.536
- And the CA.
- <i> Not the CA.</i>

20:43.738 --> 20:45.157
<i>It's a private company.</i>

20:45.940 --> 20:46.839
What?

20:47.075 --> 20:48.341
Yeah, a long time ago now.

20:48.366 --> 20:50.610
The government outsourced
itself to Jarrod Slade.

20:50.879 --> 20:52.278
- No one said boo.
- Slade?

20:52.480 --> 20:53.746
He owns it.

20:53.832 --> 20:56.182
Well, at least one
of his shell companies does.

20:56.384 --> 20:57.841
Why'd he give me this?

20:58.611 --> 21:00.999
You must have something
very valuable to him.

21:01.983 --> 21:04.723
Slade gets what he wants,
one way or another.

21:05.026 --> 21:07.037
And then he has this way
of turning it around

21:07.062 --> 21:08.628
and making it what you want as well.

21:08.863 --> 21:10.332
It's pretty hard to resist.

21:11.466 --> 21:12.876
That's why you slept with me.

21:14.002 --> 21:16.836
No. That sweet moment of indiscretion

21:17.072 --> 21:18.571
was all about your ass.

21:19.412 --> 21:21.274
I liked you, Waruu,

21:21.509 --> 21:23.609
and Slade always has, too.

21:23.878 --> 21:25.972
But you have to ask yourself why.

21:27.332 --> 21:29.182
I have a story to file.

21:29.417 --> 21:32.685
- You going?
- I'm leaving.

21:55.877 --> 21:56.976
Where are you?

22:12.861 --> 22:14.150
Neat trick.

22:15.430 --> 22:17.130
Very powerful.

22:17.399 --> 22:19.031
I don't exactly feel powerful.

22:23.605 --> 22:25.538
I know who locked your friend Kora up.

22:27.675 --> 22:29.342
Had Jimmy wrapped around his finger.

22:31.579 --> 22:33.588
It was his lab you found her in.

22:34.282 --> 22:36.275
- <i> What guy?</i>
- You know him.

22:36.985 --> 22:38.467
His name's Slade.

22:39.487 --> 22:40.920
He was in your bar.

22:43.057 --> 22:44.891
How do you know all about this?

22:45.051 --> 22:46.826
He offered me money for your head.

22:48.296 --> 22:49.762
And that's what the beach was about.

22:49.964 --> 22:51.320
He's the CA.

22:51.966 --> 22:54.133
He's been disappearing Hairies
and we have to stop him.

22:54.269 --> 22:55.504
We?

22:56.271 --> 22:58.337
It was his man that killed your friend.

23:03.478 --> 23:05.211
Well, then we should pay him a visit.

23:05.547 --> 23:07.447
<i> All humans of the Zone,</i>

23:07.715 --> 23:10.183
<i>you have 24 hours to vacate.</i>

23:10.518 --> 23:14.086
<i>Please proceed to the
checkpoint immediately.</i>

23:16.057 --> 23:17.957
<i>This is not a drill.</i>

23:23.031 --> 23:25.097
<i>All human inhabitants of the Zone</i>

23:25.400 --> 23:27.733
<i>should proceed to the exit immediately.</i>

<i>Ensure you are carrying</i>
<i>a valid human ID pass.</i>

24:24.459 --> 24:26.726
<i>All humans of the Zone,</i>

24:27.061 --> 24:30.730
<i>please proceed to the
checkpoint immediately.</i>

24:31.099 --> 24:35.201
<i>The Containment Authority can no
longer guarantee your safety.</i>

24:37.338 --> 24:39.138
<i>This is not a drill.</i>

24:50.518 --> 24:51.617
<i>All humans of the Zone...</i>

25:02.001 --> 25:06.411
Excuse me, I'm just looking
for the Ilythia Clinic.

25:07.841 --> 25:11.109
Um, the Ilythia Clinic.
It's for fertility.

25:11.344 --> 25:12.844
We're dermatologists.

25:13.146 --> 25:16.247
No, it used to be
right here in this office.

25:16.483 --> 25:18.052
Been here for five years.

25:18.885 --> 25:20.197
Sorry, I...

25:28.929 --> 25:30.762
Oh, must be a mistake.

25:47.614 --> 25:48.880
<i>Humans of the Zone,</i>

25:49.182 --> 25:52.043
<i>you have less than 12 hours to vacate.</i>

25:53.120 --> 25:54.940
<i>Please approach the gates</i>

25:55.021 --> 25:58.289
<i>in a calm and orderly fashion</i>
<i>with your IDs at the ready.</i>

25:58.658 --> 26:01.693
<i>Ensure you are
carrying a valid human ID pass.</i>

26:03.597 --> 26:05.183
Go on. Keep on moving.

26:05.899 --> 26:07.336
There you go.

26:09.002 --> 26:10.935
Can't even recognize you now.

26:14.472 --> 26:16.040
You look like Mom.

26:17.210 --> 26:18.409
Now, if we get pulled up,

26:18.678 --> 26:20.431
you let me do the talking, all right?

26:21.815 --> 26:23.014
Let's go.

26:34.761 --> 26:35.760
You realize you're gonna be

26:35.996 --> 26:37.795
the last survivor of your species?

26:38.165 --> 26:40.732
<i>...closure of the
walled community known as the Zone.</i>

26:41.001 --> 26:44.068
<i>What an exalted position.</i>

26:44.437 --> 26:47.172
<i>What a difference from that
wailing, hysterical mother you were</i>

26:47.440 --> 26:49.107
<i>when you were arrested on the street.</i>

26:49.476 --> 26:51.576
<i>Suspected subhumans
have been detained on sight.</i>

26:51.811 --> 26:53.711
<i>Look at you now.</i>

26:53.914 --> 26:55.914
<i>Now you're glorious.</i>

26:56.082 --> 26:57.441
<i>Mmm.</i>

26:58.385 --> 27:00.233
<i>And I made you.</i>

27:01.354 --> 27:03.354
<i>There have been several attempts</i>

27:03.657 --> 27:05.690
<i>by subhuman dissidents to escape</i>

27:06.026 --> 27:08.893
<i>and a subhuman male</i>
<i>has been shot dead on sight</i>

27:09.162 --> 27:10.495
<i>following a brutal assault...</i>

27:10.697 --> 27:11.952
That's too hard.

27:12.532 --> 27:15.137
It's too tight.

27:16.136 --> 27:17.569
Stop it.

27:17.804 --> 27:19.637
Stop it.

27:21.608 --> 27:23.575
<i>Stop it.</i>

28:27.807 --> 28:29.307
Go back.

28:29.476 --> 28:30.942
Go back. Go.

29:25.999 --> 29:27.298
Give me your gun.

29:29.769 --> 29:32.025
You can't die. I can.

29:50.824 --> 29:54.292
Jarrod, the Ilythia Clinic
doesn't exist.

29:54.494 --> 29:55.393
<i>Of course it does.</i>

29:55.662 --> 29:57.662
You have the baby to prove it.

29:57.997 --> 30:00.472
<i>I was right there where it was.
It's gone.</i>

30:01.401 --> 30:02.800
They must have moved premises.

30:03.002 --> 30:04.189
These things happen.

30:04.596 --> 30:06.070
<i>You're hormonal, my darling.</i>

30:06.289 --> 30:08.706
No, this has got nothing
to do with being hormonal.

30:09.008 --> 30:10.808
There's no trace of it.
There's no website.

30:11.177 --> 30:13.711
<i>There's no medical journal articles
and no listing of a Dr. Everick.</i>

30:14.013 --> 30:15.546
All the things I looked up
when I was researching,

30:15.815 --> 30:18.616
they've just... they've gone.

30:19.142 --> 30:20.218
<i>There'll be a logical explanation.</i>

30:20.420 --> 30:22.253
<i>Don't fob me off!</i>

30:22.555 --> 30:24.288
<i>I may be pregnant,</i>
<i>but I haven't lost my brain.</i>

30:24.624 --> 30:27.258
<i>There's something</i>
<i>very wrong with the baby!</i>

30:27.594 --> 30:29.694
I need you to cancel your meeting
or whatever you're doing,

30:29.963 --> 30:32.113
and I need you to come home right now!

30:32.599 --> 30:34.899
<i>Please come home, Jarrod. Jarrod?</i>

30:35.101 --> 30:36.233
Later, I promise.

30:39.839 --> 30:41.272
Gentlemen.

30:41.441 --> 30:42.440
Welcome.

30:42.609 --> 30:43.875
Jarrod?

31:12.806 --> 31:14.071
You killed Ash.

31:49.609 --> 31:53.308
Waruu, we don't need to play this game.

31:54.013 --> 31:55.646
You're the true Cleverman.

31:55.982 --> 31:59.884
This guy, he's just Jimmy's
little joke against us.

32:01.253 --> 32:02.828
What did you do to him?

32:05.558 --> 32:08.693
Other than the odd saliva
extraction, he's unharmed.

32:08.995 --> 32:10.928
And the others
in the containment centers?

32:11.130 --> 32:12.364
What about them?

32:14.534 --> 32:16.716
I'm a man of science, Waruu.

32:17.804 --> 32:20.605
I've taken Darwin's theory
of natural selection

32:20.807 --> 32:22.273
<i>and given it a reboot.</i>

32:23.269 --> 32:24.876
I'm the living proof.

32:29.015 --> 32:30.214
An injection of this

32:30.483 --> 32:32.950
could give you another
100 years of life,

32:33.119 --> 32:34.719
maybe 150.

32:35.021 --> 32:37.688
<i>And not just life, but enhanced life.</i>

32:37.924 --> 32:39.156
<i>I took one dose of this</i>

32:39.359 --> 32:43.995
and I feel so alive.

32:47.534 --> 32:48.798
Help yourself.

32:53.172 --> 32:54.539
The world's at a tipping point

32:54.807 --> 32:56.707
<i>where only the fit will survive</i>

32:57.043 --> 32:59.213
<i>and I'm ensuring there'll be</i>
<i>at least some of us left.</i>

33:00.079 --> 33:03.748
You and I, we're the
custodians of the future.

33:04.050 --> 33:05.550
<i>We could change this world together.</i>

33:05.852 --> 33:07.789
<i>You could finish what Jimmy couldn't.</i>

33:08.521 --> 33:11.122
Your people have
50,000 years of research

33:11.424 --> 33:14.125
locked up in stories,
knowledge of the land,

33:14.394 --> 33:16.894
how to live with it, not try to tame it.

33:18.398 --> 33:20.965
I need your help
to unlock that knowledge.

33:21.902 --> 33:24.335
<i>If that means the odd
sacrifice along the way,</i>

33:24.604 --> 33:26.504
then, yeah, I'm willing to make it.

33:30.410 --> 33:31.663
Are you?

33:53.199 --> 33:54.932
He... hey.

33:56.603 --> 33:58.502
Finish him.

33:59.806 --> 34:01.183
What?

34:04.611 --> 34:06.477
They shot my sister!

34:09.215 --> 34:11.148
She was just a kid.

34:11.417 --> 34:14.085
I'm... I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

34:14.320 --> 34:16.286
How much did you get for my family?

34:21.094 --> 34:23.027
<i>I'm... I'm sorry.</i>

34:33.572 --> 34:35.272
This doesn't solve anything.

34:50.123 --> 34:52.590
I'm sorry! Oh, please! I'm sorry!

34:52.824 --> 34:55.092
I'm sor... please don't!

34:56.795 --> 34:58.329
Come on, dog!

36:08.905 --> 36:10.227
Come on, dog!

36:10.975 --> 36:12.197
Get the hell off me!

36:16.681 --> 36:18.080
Please, no.

36:18.249 --> 36:19.282
Ah!

36:20.752 --> 36:22.165
You want our blood?

36:22.787 --> 36:24.725
You want our blood?

36:26.845 --> 36:28.678
<i>That's what you're</i>
<i>really after, isn't it?</i>

36:29.045 --> 36:30.826
<i>Our Hairy blood?</i>

36:31.162 --> 36:34.463
Well, get ready to lose yours!

36:35.623 --> 36:37.991
<i>This dirty human came and sold us out!</i>

36:38.159 --> 36:39.168
You see?

36:39.861 --> 36:41.861
This one deserves to die!

36:42.063 --> 36:43.162
All right, dogs?

37:12.761 --> 37:14.460
All right, everyone.
Back to your stations.

37:17.465 --> 37:19.732
We got until tomorrow morning yet.

37:21.770 --> 37:24.219
They may all kill each other by then.

37:25.106 --> 37:26.739
Job done.

37:31.379 --> 37:34.013
There's no need to rush things.

37:34.282 --> 37:36.635
<i>Let's see what you've got in here.</i>

37:40.355 --> 37:42.321
If Jimmy hadn't messed me about,

37:42.557 --> 37:44.157
we wouldn't be here like this.

37:45.527 --> 37:47.293
But I need access to the dreaming.

37:47.683 --> 37:49.429
It's not yours to have.

38:05.146 --> 38:06.612
Aah!

38:49.357 --> 38:50.289
<i>All right, bring it in!</i>

38:50.525 --> 38:52.258
Come on, come on, come on!

38:53.561 --> 38:54.617
Come on!

38:55.363 --> 38:57.063
I'm only gonna say this once!

38:58.766 --> 39:00.170
What are you scared of?

39:02.370 --> 39:06.038
The time for change is now!

39:08.541 --> 39:13.112
Today is the day we take
back what belongs to us!

39:13.381 --> 39:16.482
I have successfully negotiated

39:16.784 --> 39:20.620
ownership of this land for all of us!

39:21.409 --> 39:23.546
We have title.

39:24.492 --> 39:26.314
No one's gonna take it away from us!

39:27.162 --> 39:29.706
We will never be moved on.

39:30.765 --> 39:34.133
This will be a safe place for us,

39:34.402 --> 39:37.436
our children,
and our children's children.

39:39.974 --> 39:43.922
Today, we say good-bye to despair,

39:44.746 --> 39:47.962
to greed, to violence!

39:48.783 --> 39:50.816
Well...

39:51.481 --> 39:53.319
sorry about that fella,

39:53.621 --> 39:55.922
but he was a cancer
that had to be removed.

39:56.850 --> 39:59.592
We need team players now.

40:00.054 --> 40:02.410
We will build here...

40:02.964 --> 40:06.165
a community that will show
the rest of the world

40:06.367 --> 40:07.858
the way forward.

40:08.503 --> 40:10.474
Black, white,

40:11.105 --> 40:13.139
human, Hairy...

40:13.341 --> 40:14.807
we are one.

40:15.009 --> 40:17.777
We are united.

40:18.446 --> 40:22.014
We are family now and forever!

40:25.453 --> 40:26.989
Did you hear what I said?

40:28.123 --> 40:30.223
Say something!
