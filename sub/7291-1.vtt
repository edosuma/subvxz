00:18.051 --> 00:20.986
<i>Christmas 1944.</i>

00:21.087 --> 00:22.254
<i>World War II is at its climax</i>

00:22.355 --> 00:25.324
<i>as the German army embarks</i>
<i>on a last chance offensive</i>

00:25.425 --> 00:28.527
<i>in the Ardennes forest, Belgium.</i>

00:28.628 --> 00:32.231
<i>This offensive will become known</i>
<i>as the Battle of the Bulge.</i>

00:32.332 --> 00:35.501
<i>The allied armies were</i>
<i>pushed back nearly 40 miles.</i>

00:35.602 --> 00:38.303
<i>For those of us who lived</i>
<i>within the bulge,</i>

00:38.405 --> 00:40.939
<i>Germany ruled once again</i>
<i>prevailed.</i>

02:02.655 --> 02:05.624
I am so tired of this mud.

02:05.725 --> 02:06.925
I blame the Germans.

02:07.026 --> 02:08.827
Mother.

02:08.928 --> 02:12.831
Pauline told me the village
agrees with her about canceling

02:12.932 --> 02:15.467
the Christmas Eve
celebrations again.

02:15.568 --> 02:17.703
And the other half still thinks
we should celebrate.

02:17.804 --> 02:20.305
When we were liberated,
it makes sense to celebrate

02:20.406 --> 02:22.674
but now that the Germans
are back,

02:22.775 --> 02:23.942
it's too much risk.

02:24.043 --> 02:25.878
Christmas is God's day.

02:25.979 --> 02:27.913
We should celebrate no
matter our conditions,

02:28.014 --> 02:29.648
that's not what you said
last year.

02:29.749 --> 02:30.916
Last year was different.

02:31.017 --> 02:32.651
We've gone long enough without.

02:32.752 --> 02:35.554
Alina, this war will end

02:35.655 --> 02:39.892
and there will be many more
Christmases to come.

02:39.993 --> 02:41.827
We should do as
we've always done.

02:41.928 --> 02:43.529
Keep out of sight.

02:43.630 --> 02:45.397
We live longer that way.

02:48.468 --> 02:49.968
Oh, Peter.

02:50.069 --> 02:52.771
Do you think he'll give us
a good price?

02:52.872 --> 02:55.507
He always gives us a good price.

02:55.608 --> 02:56.542
Gives you.

02:56.643 --> 02:57.876
Mother.

02:57.977 --> 03:01.346
He's a widower,
and he's rich.

03:01.447 --> 03:02.915
He likes you.

03:03.016 --> 03:03.949
It's perfect.

03:04.050 --> 03:06.652
I'm not willing to settle
on love for money.

03:06.753 --> 03:15.060
I have to feel something,
and I don't.

03:15.161 --> 03:18.030
Jensen, we're a no-go.

03:18.131 --> 03:19.431
Again?

03:19.532 --> 03:20.365
I'm almost done loading up.

03:20.466 --> 03:21.500
Yeah, unload again.

03:21.601 --> 03:24.303
The entire front just got socked
by a winter storm.

03:24.404 --> 03:26.338
The guys are having a Christmas
party over at Mulligan's,

03:26.439 --> 03:27.539
you should stop in.

03:27.640 --> 03:28.907
They never let me in there.

03:29.008 --> 03:30.275
I'll make sure no one messes
with you?

03:30.376 --> 03:32.344
Don't want all the guys not to
care about the Sugar Ray fight.

03:32.445 --> 03:33.512
Ok, yeah.

03:33.613 --> 03:35.147
Maybe.

03:48.228 --> 03:48.560
Captain Myers.

03:48.661 --> 03:50.128
Berkowitz.

03:50.230 --> 03:51.563
Get that plane loaded up
and ready to go.

03:51.664 --> 03:52.231
Sir?

03:52.332 --> 03:53.098
We're grounded.

03:53.199 --> 03:53.999
Not anymore.

03:54.100 --> 03:55.133
Hey Jensen,
where are the pilots?

03:55.235 --> 03:56.034
They're in the hangar.

03:56.135 --> 03:57.135
Go find them.

03:57.237 --> 03:59.071
We don't have time to delay.

03:59.172 --> 04:00.372
Yes sir.

04:00.473 --> 04:01.473
Captain?

04:01.574 --> 04:03.075
I um...

04:03.176 --> 04:04.409
I was wondering if you
considered my transfer

04:04.510 --> 04:05.877
to the front?

04:05.979 --> 04:06.578
I have and it's still a no.

04:06.679 --> 04:07.479
Come off it!

04:07.580 --> 04:08.580
I want to see some action,
you know?

04:08.681 --> 04:10.082
Really help someone.

04:10.183 --> 04:12.317
I didn't become a medic
to handle supply drops.

04:12.418 --> 04:13.452
You're an only child,
Berkowitz.

04:13.553 --> 04:16.120
I want to see at least one
of my men go home alive.

04:16.221 --> 04:17.221
Come on, hurry up.

04:17.322 --> 04:18.257
Let's finish loading up
this plane, let's go.

04:18.358 --> 04:20.024
Captain, please.

04:20.125 --> 04:21.860
One week, even.

04:21.961 --> 04:23.562
We can talk about it tomorrow.

04:23.663 --> 04:25.831
You say that every time.

04:25.932 --> 04:28.267
You never know,
tomorrow might be better.

05:08.941 --> 05:11.009
Excuse me, madam,

05:11.110 --> 05:13.478
would you like some wurst
for your little boy?

05:13.579 --> 05:17.282
Ya, that's very kind of you.

05:17.383 --> 05:22.321
If I had known about the attack
we would have stayed home.

05:22.422 --> 05:24.923
We never miss a Christmas
together.

05:25.024 --> 05:28.160
The advance was unexpected.

05:31.497 --> 05:33.999
It's getting like that
in Berlin.

05:34.100 --> 05:38.603
More and more people
in the streets, hungry.

05:40.039 --> 05:40.872
Excuse me?

05:40.973 --> 05:42.040
Yes Madam?

05:42.141 --> 05:45.577
I want a few more slices
of wurst, if you don't mind.

05:45.678 --> 05:47.446
It's my pleasure.

05:49.349 --> 05:50.882
It's that good?

05:50.983 --> 05:54.286
It's not for him.

05:54.387 --> 05:56.788
My father always says

05:56.889 --> 06:00.125
"if you want to win the hearts
of people,

06:00.226 --> 06:03.295
"then feed their bellies".

06:03.396 --> 06:05.297
Kommstau Phillip.

06:10.536 --> 06:13.839
<i>Merry Christmas,</i>
<i>your steaks are on me.</i>

06:13.940 --> 06:15.841
<i>Here.</i>

06:24.951 --> 06:26.017
Peter.

06:26.119 --> 06:29.020
Ah, Helena, Alina.

06:29.122 --> 06:31.123
I have the pork belly here,

06:31.224 --> 06:33.191
and I would like 50 marks
this time, please.

06:33.292 --> 06:34.459
50 marks?

06:34.560 --> 06:40.265
Fine, but I only do this because
it's the Christmas season.

06:40.366 --> 06:41.433
Did you hear Pauline wants

06:41.534 --> 06:43.368
to cancel our Christmas
celebration?

06:43.469 --> 06:44.336
I heard.

06:44.437 --> 06:46.938
Alina, I made you head of
the Kerstavond

06:47.039 --> 06:51.176
and I think it's about time
we celebrate.

06:51.277 --> 06:55.981
I would, but the risk
is too great.

06:56.082 --> 06:57.949
We'll postpone another year.

06:58.050 --> 07:01.386
Perhaps we three could celebrate
together here.

07:01.487 --> 07:03.355
I cook, we drink.

07:03.456 --> 07:05.023
That's a very kind invitation,

07:05.124 --> 07:08.293
but if not for the festival
I'd rather stay home.

07:10.563 --> 07:12.063
Thank you.

07:21.707 --> 07:23.909
Gentlemen,
sorry for the delay,

07:24.010 --> 07:25.043
I know this is short notice

07:25.144 --> 07:26.545
but it came down
the pipe this morning

07:26.646 --> 07:28.580
so we had to move fast.

07:28.681 --> 07:31.183
We're currently about five miles
behind enemy lines.

07:31.284 --> 07:32.818
The Germans are using
two bridges

07:32.919 --> 07:36.154
to cross the Orr River
here and here.

07:36.255 --> 07:39.157
You guys are going to blow
the one located in Dasburg.

07:39.258 --> 07:42.127
So we infiltrate the Germans
as refugees

07:42.228 --> 07:44.563
and then once we get to Dasburg
we put on the German uniforms

07:44.664 --> 07:46.665
to gain access to the bridge.

07:46.766 --> 07:47.999
Affirmative.

07:48.100 --> 07:50.035
Now this mission is going to
take both of you to accomplish.

07:50.136 --> 07:52.204
Timing the explosives
on each side of the bridge

07:52.305 --> 07:53.138
is very important,

07:53.239 --> 07:54.906
it's the only way to get
the bridge down.

07:55.007 --> 07:56.808
You guys are the best team
of demolition experts

07:56.909 --> 07:59.578
I can find that speak
fluent German.

08:02.348 --> 08:03.949
What is all of that?

08:04.050 --> 08:05.016
Are you writing a book?

08:05.117 --> 08:09.087
It's one of them dirty stories
like in Esquire.

08:09.188 --> 08:10.489
Bigger words, Jensen.

08:10.590 --> 08:12.090
Bigger words.

08:17.096 --> 08:18.763
Here we go.

08:22.001 --> 08:24.135
<i>Three minutes to drop...</i>

08:42.355 --> 08:43.587
<i>May Day, May Day, going down!</i>

08:43.688 --> 08:44.990
<i>Going down!!!</i>

08:45.992 --> 08:48.059
<i>Mother, the record player</i>
<i>is too loud.</i>

08:48.160 --> 08:49.261
<i>It comforts me.</i>

08:49.362 --> 08:50.662
<i>I'm going to feed the animals.</i>

08:50.763 --> 08:53.164
<i>Oh, and make sure the oven has</i>
<i>plenty of wood for the night.</i>

08:53.266 --> 08:55.133
<i>I don't want the animals</i>
<i>to freeze.</i>

08:55.234 --> 08:57.802
I know, mother. I know.

09:03.643 --> 09:04.943
Oh, come on!

09:30.036 --> 09:31.703
Meyers!

09:34.173 --> 09:35.707
I didn't think I'd make it.

09:35.808 --> 09:38.009
I barely got out of
the airplane.

09:38.110 --> 09:38.910
Hey, where are we?

09:39.011 --> 09:39.811
I think we're uh-

09:39.912 --> 09:41.646
<i>Help!</i>

09:41.747 --> 09:42.881
That's Jensen!

09:42.982 --> 09:44.816
Follow me. Stay tight.

09:46.218 --> 09:48.620
Help! Help! Help!!!

09:48.721 --> 09:50.121
Keep it down, Jensen!

09:50.222 --> 09:51.623
Shut it!

09:51.724 --> 09:53.592
My leg, I think it's busted!

09:53.693 --> 09:55.293
You have
to quiet down!

09:59.398 --> 10:00.298
Where's Lefeuvre?

10:00.399 --> 10:02.534
He didn't make it.

10:02.635 --> 10:03.969
But I've got his gun
and his pack.

10:04.070 --> 10:04.869
Gimme that!

10:04.971 --> 10:06.571
We need to get Jensen
to shelter,

10:06.672 --> 10:08.306
find some medical supplies.

10:08.407 --> 10:10.041
God, his leg is busted up
pretty bad.

10:10.142 --> 10:13.178
No, it's ok,
it's gonna be fine.

10:15.247 --> 10:17.048
Alright, we gotta move.

10:17.149 --> 10:18.049
Can you guys get him?

10:18.150 --> 10:19.818
Yeah, come on.

10:21.354 --> 10:29.427
I got you, let's go.

10:44.443 --> 10:46.244
Dubois.

10:49.615 --> 10:51.483
<i>Halt!</i>

10:57.757 --> 10:58.390
Alina?

10:58.491 --> 10:59.190
Don't move!

10:59.291 --> 11:00.058
Wait!

11:00.159 --> 11:01.326
There are no Germans here.

11:01.427 --> 11:02.494
Not here.

11:02.595 --> 11:03.228
Please, we-

11:03.329 --> 11:04.362
we are peaceful.

11:04.463 --> 11:05.463
You're English?

11:05.564 --> 11:06.398
Half.

11:06.499 --> 11:07.265
On my father's side.

11:07.366 --> 11:08.333
Bradford.

11:08.434 --> 11:10.502
My mother is Belgian.

11:10.603 --> 11:11.503
My family has always
lived here,

11:11.604 --> 11:13.638
but we take no allegiance
to the Germans.

11:13.739 --> 11:16.441
Do you know where
the Germans are?

11:16.542 --> 11:17.542
Not here.

11:17.643 --> 11:19.477
I promise.

11:29.155 --> 11:30.555
Dubois?

11:32.825 --> 11:35.593
I've got a wounded man who
needs shelter or he'll die.

11:35.695 --> 11:37.529
Will you help us?

11:41.400 --> 11:43.435
The barn is warm.

11:43.536 --> 11:45.303
We have a stove
for the animals.

11:45.404 --> 11:47.305
If the Germans find out...

11:47.406 --> 11:49.374
Mother.

11:50.710 --> 11:53.111
I will not turn away a wounded
man to die.

11:53.212 --> 11:56.014
Not tonight.

11:56.115 --> 11:57.215
Thank you.

11:57.316 --> 11:59.117
Do you mind if I check
your home?

11:59.218 --> 12:00.151
Yes.

12:00.252 --> 12:02.320
I mean no, please.

12:05.524 --> 12:07.292
Come with me.

12:12.098 --> 12:13.064
Ok, I have to set the bone,
close the wound,

12:13.165 --> 12:14.032
stop the bleeding.

12:14.133 --> 12:15.700
I need boiling water
and some bandages.

12:15.801 --> 12:17.635
I'm Captain John Myers,
this is Lieutenant Berkowitz,

12:17.737 --> 12:19.404
Private Jensen.

12:19.505 --> 12:22.574
We have hot water and I can
make some bandages.

12:22.675 --> 12:24.375
The cottage is clear.

12:24.477 --> 12:26.277
Dubois, can you help her
get some hot water, please?

12:26.378 --> 12:28.279
I didn't ask for help.

12:34.720 --> 12:38.156
We don't have much,
but I'll do what I can.

12:45.297 --> 12:46.631
I can't delay any longer.

12:46.732 --> 12:47.766
I've studied the bridge,

12:47.867 --> 12:49.200
I can complete
this mission alone.

12:49.301 --> 12:49.868
No, no, no.

12:49.969 --> 12:51.770
You know that's not true.

12:51.871 --> 12:54.272
The timing on those charges
is too precise.

12:54.373 --> 12:55.640
Yes, but all I have
to do is-

12:55.741 --> 12:57.342
Dubois.

12:57.443 --> 12:59.344
I brought some drinks.

13:08.988 --> 13:10.822
Thank you for your help.

13:10.923 --> 13:13.992
I would have done the same
for anyone.

13:14.093 --> 13:15.760
Oh, this is very good.

13:15.861 --> 13:17.929
Coffee with a little chocolate.

13:18.030 --> 13:20.598
It was for our Kerstavonds.

13:20.699 --> 13:22.801
Kerstavonds?

13:22.902 --> 13:24.536
Kerstavonds.

13:24.637 --> 13:25.970
Christmas Eve dinner.

13:26.071 --> 13:29.040
A Belgian tradition.

13:29.141 --> 13:32.010
It's been a long time
since we celebrated it.

13:32.111 --> 13:34.212
And this year?

13:34.313 --> 13:35.547
The risk is too great.

13:38.217 --> 13:40.919
Captain, Jensen is stable.

13:41.020 --> 13:43.555
I've set the bone,
but he needs rest.

13:43.656 --> 13:45.790
But you can't stay here.

13:45.891 --> 13:47.892
It's too dangerous for us.

13:47.993 --> 13:49.961
Mother.

13:50.062 --> 13:51.963
She's right.

13:52.064 --> 13:52.697
We wait out the day,

13:52.798 --> 13:54.032
we move out tomorrow night.

13:54.133 --> 13:57.569
Sir, if we move him too soon
he could die.

13:57.670 --> 13:58.703
I understand the risk.

13:58.804 --> 14:00.672
I'm not going to put this family
in any more danger

14:00.773 --> 14:03.208
than we have to.

14:03.309 --> 14:05.810
No.

14:05.911 --> 14:10.782
Please, you will stay here
as long as you need.

14:10.883 --> 14:12.584
I'm sick of this war,

14:12.685 --> 14:15.153
and it's Christmas
for God's sake.

14:15.254 --> 14:16.855
It's time we start
acting like it.

14:16.956 --> 14:18.990
I will be back with
some fire wood

14:19.091 --> 14:21.626
for the stove and some food.

14:21.727 --> 14:23.795
Thank you.

14:31.136 --> 14:32.537
What about our mission?

14:32.638 --> 14:34.305
I can't just sit here.

14:34.406 --> 14:35.740
I will fill Lefeuvre's spot.

14:35.841 --> 14:37.976
You and I will complete
the mission.

14:38.077 --> 14:40.078
But not before Berk says
Jensen can move

14:40.179 --> 14:43.248
and we'll make sure you guys
get across the lines safely.

14:43.349 --> 14:45.049
You guys get caught
and interrogated

14:45.150 --> 14:46.651
you could compromise
the mission,

14:46.752 --> 14:48.019
and I won't have that.

14:48.120 --> 14:51.089
Agreed?

14:51.190 --> 14:53.558
Oui, d'accord.

14:53.659 --> 14:55.760
But I don't like this waiting.

14:55.861 --> 14:58.596
Get some rest.

14:58.697 --> 15:01.699
I'll take first watch.

15:06.005 --> 15:08.973
You know that's a one-way
ticket, right?

15:09.074 --> 15:11.676
Going with him?

15:11.777 --> 15:13.711
Get some rest.

15:23.022 --> 15:24.155
Captain, more coffee?

15:24.256 --> 15:28.126
Yes, please.

15:31.063 --> 15:32.964
Thank you.

15:34.233 --> 15:36.134
So you're from England.

15:39.772 --> 15:41.572
Bradford?

15:41.674 --> 15:43.207
Yes.

15:43.309 --> 15:46.277
My mother and I were
on holiday here

15:46.378 --> 15:48.913
when the war broke out.

15:49.014 --> 15:51.716
I volunteered for the army
after Pearl Harbour.

15:51.817 --> 15:54.619
I thought it would be
good research.

15:54.720 --> 15:55.920
For?

15:56.021 --> 15:59.023
Captain Travis Mills
in Liberties Fallen.

15:59.124 --> 16:00.124
A novel?

16:00.225 --> 16:03.761
War, mystery, a little romance.

16:03.862 --> 16:07.198
Well please read me some.

16:07.299 --> 16:09.267
It's still going
from here to here.

16:09.368 --> 16:10.935
Your father?

16:11.036 --> 16:15.073
He's a professor at the
University of Birmingham.

16:15.174 --> 16:19.043
We share the same passion,
literature.

16:19.144 --> 16:20.745
Literature, as in...

16:20.846 --> 16:21.846
The classics.

16:21.947 --> 16:24.682
Shakespeare, Dante,
Plato, Poe-

16:24.783 --> 16:25.883
Poe?

16:25.985 --> 16:29.253
You know he's hardly considered
a classic.

16:29.355 --> 16:30.922
What do you know about that?

16:31.023 --> 16:35.560
1941, Texas, A&M,

16:35.661 --> 16:38.863
Bachelor's in literature.

16:38.964 --> 16:40.598
Why didn't you leave?

16:40.699 --> 16:43.868
Evacuate when we
liberated you last month?

16:43.969 --> 16:45.803
My mother was sick.

16:45.904 --> 16:47.105
Pneumonia.

16:47.206 --> 16:49.140
Have you heard anything
from your father?

16:49.241 --> 16:52.910
Christmas two years ago.

16:53.012 --> 16:54.679
How does that make you feel?

16:54.780 --> 16:56.914
No man has ever asked me
how I feel.

16:57.016 --> 17:02.220
Caught between two sides in a
war that's not yours to fight,

17:02.321 --> 17:04.055
I wondered how it must feel.

17:04.156 --> 17:05.923
Lonely.

17:06.025 --> 17:08.925
You must have someone.

17:09.028 --> 17:12.096
Most men are unavailable.

17:12.196 --> 17:14.132
Love and war.

17:14.233 --> 17:18.603
I've loved with love
that was more than love.

17:18.704 --> 17:24.275
But still, my heart hasn't found
what I'm looking for.

17:24.376 --> 17:26.210
Poe didn't write it that way.

17:26.310 --> 17:28.179
My way is true.

17:28.280 --> 17:30.715
How about this?

17:30.816 --> 17:34.519
Tomorrow is the greatest thing
in life.

17:34.620 --> 17:37.755
It comes into us at midnight,
very clean.

17:37.856 --> 17:40.124
It's perfect when it arrives,

17:40.225 --> 17:43.628
and it puts itself
into our hands.

17:43.729 --> 17:46.664
It hopes we've learned something
from yesterday.

17:46.765 --> 17:47.899
Well, that's beautiful.

17:48.000 --> 17:49.534
Is it from your book?

17:49.635 --> 17:52.670
John Wayne.

17:52.771 --> 17:55.139
And I've told myself those words
every night

17:55.240 --> 17:56.941
since my first battle,

17:57.042 --> 17:59.811
hoping that tomorrow
might be better.

17:59.912 --> 18:01.546
And?

18:01.647 --> 18:03.581
I'll tell you tomorrow.

18:12.157 --> 18:14.592
I should go.

18:14.693 --> 18:16.194
What's your name?

18:17.863 --> 18:19.997
Alina.

18:20.099 --> 18:21.866
Alina Anne Hamlin.

18:21.967 --> 18:26.237
Alina Anne Hamlin,
thank you.

18:26.338 --> 18:27.171
Good night.

18:27.272 --> 18:28.306
Captain Myers.

18:28.407 --> 18:30.374
Merry Christmas.

18:32.444 --> 18:33.778
Yeah.

18:33.879 --> 18:35.947
Merry Christmas.

18:42.154 --> 18:44.188
Morning.

18:44.289 --> 18:45.823
You don't have to do that.

18:45.924 --> 18:47.792
Oh, I'm not one
to take advantage.

18:47.893 --> 18:48.893
Where are you headed?

18:48.994 --> 18:50.228
We need a Christmas tree.

18:50.329 --> 18:51.295
How's Jensen?

18:51.396 --> 18:52.363
He's still passed out.

18:52.464 --> 18:54.599
Alright, I want you to keep
an eye on things.

18:54.700 --> 18:56.033
Hey, wait up!

18:58.170 --> 18:59.670
What if there was a patrol?

18:59.771 --> 19:01.873
They never use this path.

19:01.974 --> 19:03.674
When the war ends,

19:03.775 --> 19:05.810
what's in store
for Captain Myers?

19:05.911 --> 19:07.678
Finish my book.

19:07.779 --> 19:08.746
Wife? Kids?

19:08.847 --> 19:10.114
Not yet.

19:10.215 --> 19:11.015
And you?

19:11.116 --> 19:11.983
When the war ends-

19:12.084 --> 19:13.684
I hope to be liberated.

19:13.785 --> 19:15.786
For the second time.

19:15.888 --> 19:18.956
Find my father,
attend college as planned,

19:19.057 --> 19:23.261
then set up a primary school
here in Wereth.

19:23.362 --> 19:27.331
I never had a brother or sister
and I love children.

19:27.432 --> 19:29.634
I believe there would be
no wars

19:29.735 --> 19:31.969
if children were taught
tolerance and peace.

19:32.070 --> 19:32.904
A pacifist.

19:33.005 --> 19:33.938
A realist.

19:34.039 --> 19:35.106
War is not a solution.

19:36.074 --> 19:37.074
Here.

19:37.176 --> 19:38.876
It's perfect.

19:38.977 --> 19:39.977
It's tiny.

19:40.078 --> 19:42.113
Excuse me!

19:42.214 --> 19:44.615
It's barely above my head.

19:44.716 --> 19:45.583
Now look at this.

19:45.684 --> 19:49.020
This is a Christmas tree.

19:49.121 --> 19:49.954
It's huge.

19:50.055 --> 19:50.855
I know.

19:50.956 --> 19:51.923
No, no, no.

19:52.024 --> 19:53.324
It won't fit in my house.

19:53.425 --> 19:54.725
I can get it in.

19:54.826 --> 19:55.960
I like the small one.

19:56.061 --> 19:58.763
Nah, bigger is better.

19:58.864 --> 20:00.064
I'm not so sure.

20:00.165 --> 20:02.800
Trust me, I'm from Texas.

20:05.270 --> 20:06.637
Hmm...

20:10.776 --> 20:12.843
Do you have any decorations?

20:12.945 --> 20:13.377
No.

20:13.478 --> 20:14.845
Any raisins?

20:14.947 --> 20:15.913
No.

20:16.014 --> 20:16.948
Any nuts?

20:17.049 --> 20:20.384
Really?

20:20.485 --> 20:21.719
What do I do with that?

20:21.820 --> 20:23.955
Chew it.

20:24.056 --> 20:26.290
What are you doing?

20:26.391 --> 20:28.092
There.

20:30.295 --> 20:31.095
It's kind of small.

20:31.196 --> 20:31.929
Oh, come on.

20:32.030 --> 20:33.631
It's alright.

20:33.732 --> 20:34.932
We didn't get many gifts
in the orphanage

20:35.033 --> 20:36.934
so we had to be creative.

20:37.035 --> 20:40.037
You can put it on top
of the tree.

20:40.138 --> 20:41.005
Look at that.

20:41.106 --> 20:43.040
Mistletoe.

20:58.423 --> 21:01.759
Hey, wait up!

21:07.833 --> 21:09.367
So you were an orphan?

21:09.468 --> 21:12.637
Yeah, I never new my parents.

21:12.738 --> 21:14.739
They left me on the doorstep
of the orphanage.

21:18.143 --> 21:19.043
You said the path was closed.

21:19.144 --> 21:20.211
I said they don't use it.

21:20.312 --> 21:22.079
No, please.

21:22.180 --> 21:23.581
Please.

21:23.682 --> 21:24.882
Let me speak with them.

21:24.983 --> 21:28.219
Go Hide. Please.

21:34.359 --> 21:35.559
Guten tag.

21:35.661 --> 21:36.661
Hallo.

22:51.870 --> 22:53.003
If they laid a hand on you

22:53.105 --> 22:55.106
I would have stopped them.

22:58.210 --> 22:59.910
We should get back.

23:00.011 --> 23:01.946
You'll catch a cold.

23:03.448 --> 23:06.617
I told you it was too big.

23:06.718 --> 23:07.518
Are you always right?

23:07.619 --> 23:11.155
Yes, and your enemies agreed
with me.

23:11.256 --> 23:18.596
Nice of them to help out.

23:25.470 --> 23:26.937
You might have been right.

23:27.038 --> 23:30.808
Well, hmm...

23:30.909 --> 23:32.109
Ta-dah.

23:32.210 --> 23:35.713
Here you go.

23:37.182 --> 23:39.083
A star.

23:39.184 --> 23:40.651
The bath is ready.

23:40.752 --> 23:43.454
Ok.

23:43.555 --> 23:46.924
Here we go.

23:47.025 --> 23:48.092
Thank you.

23:48.193 --> 23:50.494
Here, take this.

23:50.595 --> 23:51.495
It was my father's.

23:51.596 --> 23:52.463
Great.

23:52.564 --> 23:55.633
To keep you warm
while these are drying.

23:55.734 --> 23:59.570
Ah, so you're saying just...

23:59.671 --> 24:00.438
in the other room?

24:00.539 --> 24:01.472
Yes, right.

24:01.573 --> 24:03.474
Over there.

24:04.142 --> 24:05.810
Lovely.

24:50.489 --> 24:53.457
Is he ok?

24:53.558 --> 24:56.994
He fell in the stream.

24:57.095 --> 25:01.065
It's a good thing, Alina,
what you're doing for them.

25:01.166 --> 25:04.468
But don't forget
who they are.

25:04.569 --> 25:05.603
And who are they?

25:05.704 --> 25:07.071
Soldiers.

25:07.172 --> 25:08.138
Today they're here,

25:08.240 --> 25:11.408
but tomorrow they're
re-deployed,

25:11.510 --> 25:13.878
wed or dead.

25:13.979 --> 25:15.980
It's not what I want
for you.

25:16.081 --> 25:19.049
I was you once.

25:19.150 --> 25:23.554
I fell in love with
a French soldier,

25:23.655 --> 25:26.123
before your father.

25:26.224 --> 25:31.762
We spent two weeks together.

25:31.863 --> 25:37.535
I never saw him again.

25:37.636 --> 25:40.504
It's better you love a scholar
or a butcher.

25:40.605 --> 25:41.906
So, Peter.

25:42.007 --> 25:44.008
Yes, Peter.

25:44.109 --> 25:47.545
Peter will keep you safe,
he will take care-

25:47.646 --> 25:50.848
What if I don't want "safe"?

25:50.949 --> 25:55.619
I want to dream that
all of this is over.

25:55.720 --> 25:58.656
That we can take risks
and look beautiful

25:58.757 --> 26:01.592
without fear of-

26:01.693 --> 26:04.161
I want to know love.

26:04.262 --> 26:09.500
Even if it's just for
one fleeting winter night.

26:09.601 --> 26:11.669
Can't I have that?

26:30.221 --> 26:32.022
<i>The animals are fed,</i>
<i>mother.</i>

26:32.123 --> 26:33.958
<i>Thank you, Alina.</i>

26:39.497 --> 26:41.465
My father's name is Henry.

26:44.469 --> 26:46.704
Can I show you something?

26:46.805 --> 26:48.572
Yeah.

26:56.481 --> 26:59.917
They were banned,
so I had to hide them.

27:03.188 --> 27:04.989
Britolt.

27:07.626 --> 27:08.926
Poe.

27:10.962 --> 27:12.830
Hemingway.

27:16.434 --> 27:17.534
Karl Marx?

27:17.636 --> 27:19.903
Only to understand
communist thought.

27:20.005 --> 27:22.539
My father said it was important
to understand all ideas

27:22.641 --> 27:24.475
so we can formulate our own.

27:24.576 --> 27:26.810
Marx had good ideas
but the communist system

27:26.911 --> 27:28.646
can be unjust to the poor,

27:28.747 --> 27:30.481
or the rich become a hidden
ruling class,

27:30.582 --> 27:34.518
claiming everything is equal
when clearly it's not.

27:34.619 --> 27:36.086
What?

27:36.187 --> 27:40.591
Wine is the most civilized thing
in the world.

27:40.692 --> 27:43.494
Hemingway.

27:43.595 --> 27:47.464
"That the things of the night
cannot be explained in the day,

27:47.565 --> 27:50.734
"because they do not
then exist."

27:54.005 --> 27:56.140
One of my favourites.

27:56.241 --> 27:58.909
His words have such hope
when plagued by tragedy.

27:59.010 --> 28:01.912
Happy endings
aren't really his style.

28:02.013 --> 28:04.715
I hope to meet him someday.

28:04.816 --> 28:06.684
Who? Hemingway?

28:06.785 --> 28:07.818
Yes, of course.

28:07.919 --> 28:10.020
Here, let me get that.

28:10.121 --> 28:11.789
Thank you.

28:14.025 --> 28:15.659
I've had the pleasure.

28:15.760 --> 28:16.760
Of what?

28:16.861 --> 28:18.762
I met Hemingway.

28:18.863 --> 28:20.030
Really?

28:20.131 --> 28:22.499
What was he like?

28:22.600 --> 28:27.171
He's a big man.

28:27.272 --> 28:28.706
And a little bit introverted.

28:28.807 --> 28:30.107
Introverted?

28:30.208 --> 28:32.443
How so?

28:32.544 --> 28:36.814
Well, when he spoke,
everyone listened

28:36.915 --> 28:43.487
because he never said anything
that didn't need saying.

28:43.588 --> 28:46.490
I can only imagine.

28:46.591 --> 28:47.925
I'm putting on a record.

28:48.026 --> 28:50.928
<i>One of my favourites.</i>
<i>It's American.</i>

28:56.735 --> 28:58.102
You must miss home.

28:58.203 --> 29:00.471
I've never had a home.

29:00.572 --> 29:02.172
What about Texas?

29:02.273 --> 29:06.610
I've never seen "home"
as a place.

29:06.711 --> 29:11.215
Home is a refuge from plight.

29:11.316 --> 29:15.452
Two souls sewn together
in love.

29:15.553 --> 29:20.491
It can't be created,
it has to be discovered.

29:20.592 --> 29:26.797
And then held onto forever.

29:26.898 --> 29:29.500
I like that.

29:29.601 --> 29:31.535
Alina.

29:31.636 --> 29:33.737
Yes?

29:33.838 --> 29:37.074
Today is better.

29:38.076 --> 29:39.109
Sir?

29:39.210 --> 29:40.944
You better come see this.

29:47.118 --> 29:48.485
It's good to see you
pull through.

29:48.586 --> 29:49.920
Yes, sir.

29:50.021 --> 29:50.954
I'll be fine.

29:51.055 --> 29:52.689
We can move out in the morning.

29:52.791 --> 29:55.125
The daylight is too risky.

29:55.226 --> 29:57.728
The night is too cold
with his leg in a splint.

29:57.829 --> 29:59.830
We won't get far.

29:59.931 --> 30:02.166
I'll do whatever it takes.

30:02.267 --> 30:03.433
Really.

30:03.535 --> 30:05.469
I talked to Helena.

30:05.570 --> 30:08.772
She told me if we move North
about three kilometers from here

30:08.873 --> 30:11.475
we should find the American
seventh armoured.

30:11.576 --> 30:13.510
They held their position.

30:13.611 --> 30:14.912
And if they get pushed back?

30:15.013 --> 30:17.381
Jensen and I keep going alone.

30:17.482 --> 30:19.683
And if you guys get captured?

30:19.784 --> 30:22.586
You could compromise
the mission.

30:22.687 --> 30:24.888
We won't allow that
to happen.

30:29.260 --> 30:33.030
Ok, we move at first light.

30:46.244 --> 30:48.579
I wouldn't put her off.

30:48.680 --> 30:52.149
A soldier's life is expedient,
my friend.

30:52.250 --> 30:56.119
And opportunity is
in short supply.

30:56.221 --> 30:57.955
I don't want to hurt her.

30:58.056 --> 31:00.757
Captain, if I may?

31:00.859 --> 31:04.094
Tomorrow we could be
dead or alive,

31:04.195 --> 31:10.167
but today, today is
what we live for.

31:34.993 --> 31:36.660
For your travels.

31:36.761 --> 31:41.465
Just some small items.

31:41.566 --> 31:44.034
And here.

31:44.135 --> 31:45.402
No, I couldn't.

31:45.503 --> 31:46.236
Please...

31:46.337 --> 31:50.674
It will keep you warm
and safe.

31:50.775 --> 31:52.009
Thank you.

31:52.110 --> 31:56.513
Oh, and if you follow this map
you will...

32:02.086 --> 32:06.690
avoid the German patrols and
it takes you to the front line.

32:06.791 --> 32:09.726
We've become quite good
at moving around undetected.

32:09.827 --> 32:11.194
Thank you.

32:11.296 --> 32:11.895
Berk.

32:11.996 --> 32:14.064
Yeah.

32:14.165 --> 32:16.466
Thank you again
for taking me in.

32:16.567 --> 32:19.102
I don't think I would have
made it if it wasn't for you.

32:19.203 --> 32:21.038
Get home safe.

32:21.139 --> 32:22.105
Merry Christmas.

32:22.206 --> 32:24.107
Safe travels to you all.

32:33.184 --> 32:34.885
I'll see you around, Alina.

32:40.224 --> 32:42.559
Thank you, ma'am.

32:47.198 --> 32:50.100
You gave him your father's coat?

32:50.201 --> 32:51.601
What?

32:51.703 --> 32:53.804
He liked that coat.

32:53.905 --> 32:56.406
Well, he's not here.

32:56.507 --> 32:59.009
Where are you going?

32:59.110 --> 33:01.078
I'm getting ready
for the Kerstavonds.

33:01.179 --> 33:03.080
But I thought you cancelled it?

33:03.181 --> 33:05.749
I've changed my mind.

33:05.850 --> 33:07.117
I'm done hiding.

33:07.218 --> 33:11.021
And this is going to be the best
Kerstavonds we've had in years.

33:11.122 --> 33:14.491
I'm going to find Peter,
we have things to do.

33:14.592 --> 33:15.826
Peter?

33:15.927 --> 33:19.062
Oh, thank God.

33:31.709 --> 33:33.543
Alina's map said the road
would be clear,

33:33.644 --> 33:35.545
but I see three troop
transports,

33:35.646 --> 33:37.814
three patrols and
at least 50 men.

33:37.915 --> 33:40.150
So much for being
always right.

33:40.251 --> 33:41.651
Pardon?

33:41.753 --> 33:43.587
Nothing.

33:44.555 --> 33:46.056
They're going to be caught.

34:14.619 --> 34:15.585
Come on.

34:24.996 --> 34:26.163
Oh no!

34:46.818 --> 34:49.052
A Farewell To Arms?

34:49.152 --> 34:51.154
Is this a joke?

34:51.255 --> 34:52.121
Is this a joke?

34:52.223 --> 34:52.889
No, sir.

34:52.989 --> 34:54.623
Not a joke.

34:54.725 --> 34:57.861
Who gave this to you?

34:57.962 --> 34:58.995
Who gave you this map?

35:01.833 --> 35:02.933
Get him up.

35:03.034 --> 35:06.870
We are going to Wereth to
discover who drew this map.

35:16.914 --> 35:18.448
We need to shut down that bridge

35:18.549 --> 35:20.417
before they figure out
their plan.

35:20.518 --> 35:21.751
We head back to Wereth.

35:23.154 --> 35:25.422
That bridge should be
in the river right now!

35:25.523 --> 35:27.557
I'm not going to leave
my men behind to die.

35:27.658 --> 35:29.426
We go back.

35:31.929 --> 35:33.130
D'accord.

35:36.467 --> 35:38.435
Alina?

35:38.536 --> 35:39.503
Here comes trouble.

35:39.604 --> 35:41.104
Pauline, how are you?

35:41.205 --> 35:42.239
Are you crazy?

35:42.340 --> 35:43.573
A party now?

35:43.674 --> 35:45.242
The war is only a kilo
from here.

35:45.343 --> 35:46.543
Let them have their war.

35:46.644 --> 35:48.178
I'm having cake.

35:50.848 --> 35:52.415
But you agreed
to postpone this.

35:52.517 --> 35:54.050
And now it's back on.

35:55.786 --> 35:58.121
Peter!

35:58.222 --> 36:00.290
Ah, Pauline.

36:00.391 --> 36:01.458
It's so good to see you.

36:01.559 --> 36:03.193
You too?

36:03.294 --> 36:05.428
But... but why?

36:05.530 --> 36:06.396
Why?

36:06.497 --> 36:09.299
Because I like to drink.

36:09.400 --> 36:11.434
But we could die.

36:11.536 --> 36:13.737
We could die sitting
in our homes.

36:13.838 --> 36:15.038
I'm done hiding.

36:15.139 --> 36:16.740
It's time we take some risks.

36:16.841 --> 36:18.642
And we are going to celebrate
Christmas.

36:21.812 --> 36:24.481
What is going on here?

36:24.582 --> 36:26.149
They are having a Christmas
party.

36:26.250 --> 36:26.750
We are only here for the-

36:26.851 --> 36:28.385
Shut up!

36:28.486 --> 36:29.653
You!

36:35.259 --> 36:36.693
Do you remember me?

36:36.794 --> 36:38.495
Ja.

36:38.596 --> 36:40.163
Do you know these men?

36:48.172 --> 36:48.805
Nein.

36:48.906 --> 36:50.640
Does anyone know these men?

36:51.909 --> 36:55.078
One of you drew a map
that takes these men back

36:55.179 --> 36:57.647
to the Americans!

36:57.748 --> 37:01.218
Someone is lying to me.

37:01.319 --> 37:04.154
If you will not cooperate...

37:04.255 --> 37:04.621
No, no, no!

37:04.722 --> 37:05.655
Please!

37:05.756 --> 37:08.458
Someone start talking
or this man is dead!

37:08.559 --> 37:09.226
Please, stop!

37:09.327 --> 37:10.493
<i>Alina!!!</i>

37:10.595 --> 37:13.196
I drew the map.

37:13.297 --> 37:14.297
You're English.

37:14.398 --> 37:16.399
Leave him alone and I
will tell you everything.

37:21.239 --> 37:23.273
Our laws are clear.

37:23.374 --> 37:25.575
Anyone who consorts
with the Americana

37:25.676 --> 37:28.111
will be considered an enemy
to Germany.

37:28.212 --> 37:29.346
No!

37:30.715 --> 37:32.415
<i>Myers!</i>

37:38.856 --> 37:40.257
Watch out!!!!!

37:41.292 --> 37:43.026
Myers! Incoming!

37:57.441 --> 37:58.775
Berk, come and get the woman.

37:58.876 --> 38:00.677
Dubois, keep them covered.

38:06.550 --> 38:08.418
She's unconscious!

38:08.519 --> 38:09.552
I'm going to pass her to you.

38:09.654 --> 38:10.687
I'm going to grab her legs.

38:10.788 --> 38:11.755
Ah, ah, ah...

38:11.856 --> 38:12.122
Got her?

38:12.223 --> 38:13.323
Yeah.

38:15.860 --> 38:17.193
Get out of the car, Myers!

38:17.295 --> 38:18.728
Hey, kid.

38:18.829 --> 38:20.697
Come here.

38:20.798 --> 38:21.998
Myers, get out of there!

38:22.099 --> 38:23.633
There's a kid in here!

38:23.734 --> 38:25.068
Myers, the car is going
to explode!

38:25.169 --> 38:25.635
Myers!

38:25.736 --> 38:26.803
Come on!

38:26.904 --> 38:28.438
Kid don't do that!

38:28.539 --> 38:29.639
Myers!

38:31.575 --> 38:32.575
You want?

38:33.511 --> 38:34.344
Myers!

38:34.445 --> 38:36.313
Myers, the car is going
to explode!

38:39.850 --> 38:41.318
Let's go get it!

38:51.295 --> 38:52.595
No!

39:39.710 --> 39:41.644
It is St. Nicholas, papa.

39:41.746 --> 39:44.114
Ja, Philip.

39:44.215 --> 39:46.149
Ja.

39:46.250 --> 39:47.450
Let him go!

39:47.551 --> 39:48.551
Tell your men to drop
their weapons.

39:48.652 --> 39:49.285
Nein!

39:49.387 --> 39:51.087
Let him go, now or I shoot!

39:51.188 --> 39:52.856
You pull that trigger,
you're next.

39:53.357 --> 39:55.692
Halt!

39:55.793 --> 39:57.160
No shooting!

39:57.261 --> 39:58.695
Myers, we got a problem!

39:58.796 --> 40:00.530
She's not gonna make it
much longer!

40:00.631 --> 40:02.198
Surrender!

40:02.299 --> 40:04.567
I promise you will be
treated fairly.

40:04.668 --> 40:07.303
85 prisoners of war
shot in the back!

40:07.405 --> 40:08.505
You call that fair?

40:08.606 --> 40:11.141
We shoot each other,
then what?

40:11.242 --> 40:12.308
Your men die.

40:12.410 --> 40:15.078
My wife, my son.

40:15.179 --> 40:16.379
He was not to be here.

40:16.480 --> 40:17.680
Myers, she doesn't have
much time!

40:17.782 --> 40:19.249
There's fragments in her chest!

40:19.350 --> 40:20.116
Mahler!

40:20.217 --> 40:20.784
Ja?

40:20.885 --> 40:21.484
Get my wife!

40:21.585 --> 40:22.519
No, no, no!

40:22.620 --> 40:23.620
Nobody move!

40:23.721 --> 40:25.155
Listen, you don't have time!

40:25.256 --> 40:28.324
If I don't help her now,
she will die!

40:28.426 --> 40:32.262
If my wife dies,
you die next!

40:33.364 --> 40:33.763
Doc?

40:33.864 --> 40:35.398
<i>Yeah.</i>

40:35.499 --> 40:36.766
Can you help her?

40:36.867 --> 40:39.402
I will not have him touch
my wife!

40:39.503 --> 40:41.271
Is there a doctor
in the village?

40:41.372 --> 40:43.173
He was shot last week!

40:45.209 --> 40:46.643
You have no option.

40:46.744 --> 40:50.146
This is the only man
who can help your wife.

40:50.247 --> 40:54.617
Look, let's make a deal, ok?

40:54.718 --> 40:56.219
A deal.

40:56.320 --> 40:58.154
We call a Christmas truce.

40:58.255 --> 40:59.789
No fighting.

40:59.890 --> 41:01.724
No one leaves town
until your wife is stable.

41:01.826 --> 41:03.526
When she is, we leave.

41:03.627 --> 41:04.627
No questions asked.

41:04.728 --> 41:06.629
A Christmas truce.

41:06.730 --> 41:08.364
How do I know I can trust you?

41:17.775 --> 41:22.212
All soldiers in the town of
Wereth will not let allegiance

41:22.313 --> 41:25.215
to country dictate
their actions.

41:25.316 --> 41:27.016
I agree to this truce.

41:27.117 --> 41:29.619
This Christmas truce.

41:29.720 --> 41:33.223
It will end when that clock
strikes noon tomorrow.

41:33.324 --> 41:37.193
At that time I expect you
and your men to be gone.

41:37.294 --> 41:39.162
Agreed.

41:39.263 --> 41:41.130
Please help my wife.

41:41.232 --> 41:42.232
Berk, that's an order.

41:42.333 --> 41:44.434
Ok, I need plasma
and a med kit.

41:44.535 --> 41:45.301
Help us.

41:45.402 --> 41:46.769
Mahler!

41:46.871 --> 41:48.071
Ja.

41:48.172 --> 41:49.439
Quickly, hurry.

41:49.540 --> 41:51.140
Ok, let's go.

41:51.242 --> 41:52.609
Into the house.

41:55.479 --> 41:57.313
This way.

41:59.316 --> 42:00.617
I don't trust them.

42:00.718 --> 42:02.619
Well, we'll stay on our toes.

42:04.688 --> 42:06.389
Myers, go see if the Germans
have any more plasma.

42:06.490 --> 42:07.457
She's gonna need it.

42:07.558 --> 42:09.158
Yes, we have.

42:09.260 --> 42:11.628
Ask Mahler.

42:11.729 --> 42:15.532
Sure.

42:15.633 --> 42:17.333
This is the last fragment.

42:17.434 --> 42:19.769
I've almost got it.

42:19.870 --> 42:25.074
Yes, yes, yes!

42:25.175 --> 42:26.476
I got it.

42:26.577 --> 42:28.411
Yes.

42:52.369 --> 42:54.103
Merry Christmas.

43:04.782 --> 43:10.453
My name is Obest Josef Braun.

43:10.554 --> 43:11.287
And I thank you?

43:11.388 --> 43:12.655
Captain John Myers.

43:12.756 --> 43:15.058
You're welcome.

43:15.159 --> 43:15.525
Butcher?

43:15.626 --> 43:17.093
Yeah.

43:17.194 --> 43:19.495
I saw American rations,

43:19.597 --> 43:23.366
beer, and French wine
in the house.

43:23.467 --> 43:26.269
My brother liked to drink.

43:26.370 --> 43:29.606
Most of that is verboten.

43:29.707 --> 43:31.074
Yeah.

43:31.175 --> 43:33.176
Except today.

43:33.277 --> 43:34.410
It's Christmas.

43:34.511 --> 43:36.245
Celebrate.

43:36.347 --> 43:38.715
Yes, yes.

43:38.816 --> 43:41.317
Please.

43:47.124 --> 43:48.625
She's resting for now.

43:48.726 --> 43:50.293
Thank you.

43:55.366 --> 43:56.799
Wine for everyone!

44:07.411 --> 44:09.579
Hey.

44:09.680 --> 44:12.215
What if his wife died?

44:12.316 --> 44:14.217
What then?

44:14.318 --> 44:17.086
You took a risk
on my mother's life,

44:17.187 --> 44:20.023
the village, my life.

44:20.124 --> 44:21.658
How could you?

44:21.759 --> 44:24.060
They were gonna shoot you.

44:24.161 --> 44:26.996
I had to do something.

44:27.097 --> 44:29.599
Do you know how we survived
this war?

44:29.700 --> 44:32.402
By not taking risks!

44:32.503 --> 44:35.204
We blend in and
they ignored us.

44:35.305 --> 44:37.306
We were safe.

44:37.408 --> 44:38.574
Then you came along...

44:38.676 --> 44:42.278
there was something
in my heart,

44:42.379 --> 44:44.180
I couldn't-

44:44.281 --> 44:48.418
turn you away,
but I should have.

44:48.519 --> 44:52.588
You gave me hope.

44:52.690 --> 44:56.159
There is no hope for us.

44:56.260 --> 44:58.027
Not here.

44:58.128 --> 45:02.498
After today, we will always
fear tomorrow.

45:02.599 --> 45:04.734
Because they don't forget.

45:04.835 --> 45:09.238
They will return from Berlin
carrying orders to kill us.

45:09.339 --> 45:11.374
And then what?

45:11.475 --> 45:13.543
Who will save us then?

45:13.644 --> 45:15.044
Who?

45:15.145 --> 45:15.478
Alina-

45:15.579 --> 45:17.280
No, don't.

45:19.683 --> 45:21.384
I'll save you.

45:28.475 --> 45:31.043
What is it?

45:31.145 --> 45:32.545
I don't know.

45:32.646 --> 45:34.480
Everything alright?

45:34.581 --> 45:35.047
Oui.

45:35.149 --> 45:36.749
Ok.

45:38.085 --> 45:41.020
Hey, Hans Mahler?

45:41.121 --> 45:42.789
Present.

45:44.091 --> 45:45.992
From FC Schalke?

45:46.093 --> 45:47.026
Ja.

45:47.127 --> 45:49.562
Schalke versus Admira Wien,

45:49.663 --> 45:51.831
you made like five goals
that game.

45:51.932 --> 45:52.932
You were there?

45:53.033 --> 45:56.602
I was scouting for AS Monaco.

45:56.703 --> 45:58.304
Pierre.

45:58.405 --> 45:59.672
Pierre Dubois!

45:59.773 --> 46:01.541
Mais oui, c'est moi.

46:02.476 --> 46:03.543
Prosit!

46:03.644 --> 46:04.510
Sante.

46:10.117 --> 46:14.420
<i>Ohh, ah!</i>

46:14.521 --> 46:16.722
Prosit.

46:16.824 --> 46:17.890
Alina.

46:17.991 --> 46:20.560
Not now, mother.

46:20.661 --> 46:21.294
Peter.

46:21.395 --> 46:22.395
Yes.

46:22.496 --> 46:23.496
How about some music?

46:23.597 --> 46:26.899
Oh, splendid. Yeah.

46:30.637 --> 46:31.904
I think I need to get some
more beer from the house.

46:32.005 --> 46:33.606
They're drinking it like water.

46:33.707 --> 46:34.407
I'll help.

46:34.508 --> 46:35.508
Ah good.

46:35.609 --> 46:36.409
Peter, right?

46:36.510 --> 46:37.410
Yeah.

46:37.511 --> 46:39.879
I think Obers Braun
would like a drink.

46:39.980 --> 46:42.281
I have a lovely bottle
of French wine inside.

46:42.382 --> 46:45.384
No, beer. German.

46:45.486 --> 46:48.054
I'll help Alina.

46:48.155 --> 46:50.456
Yeah, right.

47:00.868 --> 47:03.336
Why are you following me?

47:03.437 --> 47:04.070
Let me help you.

47:04.171 --> 47:05.371
You've already done that.

47:05.472 --> 47:06.305
And just like your invasion,

47:06.406 --> 47:09.642
I don't see you winning.

47:09.743 --> 47:10.543
Are you always like this?

47:10.644 --> 47:11.444
Like what?

47:11.545 --> 47:12.712
Firm?

47:12.813 --> 47:13.779
I've been called
many things before

47:13.881 --> 47:15.915
but "firm" is not one of them.

47:16.016 --> 47:17.483
I will have you know that just

47:17.584 --> 47:18.918
because you're some
American hot shot

47:19.019 --> 47:20.553
doesn't mean you can
just waltz in here

47:20.654 --> 47:22.822
and sweep me off my feet.

47:22.923 --> 47:24.023
I am on to you.

47:24.124 --> 47:25.458
All is fair in love and war,
Captain.

47:25.559 --> 47:28.494
Now you are playing
both games and losing.

47:28.595 --> 47:30.863
Look, you stop it!

47:30.964 --> 47:34.267
What are you smiling about?

47:34.368 --> 47:35.401
I have it.

47:35.502 --> 47:37.336
I said, I have it.

47:37.437 --> 47:38.938
Fine, you have it.

47:39.039 --> 47:40.273
Thank you.

47:40.374 --> 47:41.407
I'm getting the beer.

47:41.508 --> 47:43.409
Here I go.

47:46.446 --> 47:48.047
You know, in the orphanage,
Sister Love-

47:48.148 --> 47:49.749
Sister Love?

47:49.850 --> 47:53.419
Oh, now I know you're lying.

47:53.520 --> 47:55.755
Is that part of your
book?

47:55.856 --> 47:56.856
Martha Love, actually.

47:56.957 --> 47:58.624
It was her God-given name.

47:58.725 --> 48:02.862
Sister Love would say to us
"a wheel rolls two ways,

48:02.963 --> 48:07.500
forwards and back.

48:07.601 --> 48:09.535
But no matter which way
it rolls,

48:09.636 --> 48:11.070
y'alls gonna end up somewhere.

48:11.171 --> 48:15.641
Best try to make it some place
you want to be."

48:15.742 --> 48:20.980
Where is it you want to be,
Captain?

48:21.081 --> 48:24.450
Home.

48:24.551 --> 48:26.886
But you don't have one.

48:31.925 --> 48:34.393
I'm not your home, Captain.

48:34.494 --> 48:35.094
I promise-

48:35.195 --> 48:35.861
Promise what?

48:35.963 --> 48:37.597
To keep you safe.

48:37.698 --> 48:39.732
Don't make promises
you can't keep.

48:39.833 --> 48:41.567
I never do.

48:41.668 --> 48:43.469
Talk is cheap.

48:43.570 --> 48:45.938
Just roll the keg.

49:03.790 --> 49:06.892
You gonna let this guy
steal your girl?

49:06.994 --> 49:09.362
I'm not sure she's mine.

49:09.463 --> 49:10.529
Fellas.

49:12.899 --> 49:15.401
His wife is stable.

49:15.502 --> 49:16.669
She'll pull through.

49:16.770 --> 49:18.704
Good job, Doc.

49:18.805 --> 49:19.939
Maybe it's time we start
thinking about

49:20.040 --> 49:21.941
getting out of here.

49:22.042 --> 49:23.075
We made a truce.

49:23.176 --> 49:26.746
No one leaves until tomorrow.

49:26.847 --> 49:30.016
And what makes you think they're
going to live up to that?

49:35.889 --> 49:37.590
Where's Braun?

49:37.691 --> 49:39.091
He's in the church.

49:39.192 --> 49:41.027
I'm going to pay him a visit.

49:42.963 --> 49:46.032
Hey, Captain?

49:46.133 --> 49:50.002
We were lucky today.

49:50.103 --> 49:52.038
Yeah, we were.

50:21.501 --> 50:22.368
Here.

50:22.469 --> 50:22.902
No, it's ok-

50:23.003 --> 50:24.770
Please, I insist.

50:35.582 --> 50:38.851
I never took you
for a religious man.

50:41.955 --> 50:44.857
Yeah, well I grew up
in east Texas.

50:44.958 --> 50:46.592
Bible belt.

50:46.693 --> 50:48.961
Went to Sunday school
every week.

50:49.062 --> 50:51.664
You have Cowboys
and Indians there?

50:51.765 --> 50:52.665
Yeah.

50:52.766 --> 50:55.801
Something like that.

50:55.902 --> 50:57.503
You know John Wayne?

50:57.604 --> 50:59.338
The same John Wayne who was
in the Pacific?

51:00.574 --> 51:02.575
Yeah. I loved American cinema.

51:02.676 --> 51:04.677
John Wayne was
one of my favourites.

51:04.778 --> 51:05.845
Tough guy.

51:05.946 --> 51:07.913
I hear when he's done in
the Pacific he's coming here

51:08.014 --> 51:09.048
to clean up.

51:12.919 --> 51:15.588
I spent some time living
in Brooklyn

51:15.689 --> 51:18.591
with my grandmother.

51:18.692 --> 51:20.826
I always desired to travel
out west,

51:20.927 --> 51:25.464
but never found the way.

51:25.565 --> 51:27.933
It's just like any other place,
I guess.

51:28.034 --> 51:31.771
I want to own a ranch
and raise long horns

51:31.872 --> 51:36.041
and wear a six-shooter,
ride horses.

51:36.143 --> 51:41.647
But before the war started
I was forced to return home.

51:41.748 --> 51:44.316
My father was a patriot,

51:44.417 --> 51:47.319
never cared much for the Nazis.

51:47.420 --> 51:49.455
But Germany is our homeland.

51:49.556 --> 51:51.457
We have our duties.

51:51.558 --> 51:53.726
Well, there are some things-

51:53.827 --> 51:56.395
that men
just can't run away from.

51:57.998 --> 51:59.064
John Wayne,
you're very good.

51:59.166 --> 52:04.637
You're not bad yourself.

52:04.738 --> 52:07.773
I never had a chance to thank
you for saving my family.

52:07.874 --> 52:09.008
Please.

52:09.109 --> 52:12.878
No, we are enemies.

52:12.979 --> 52:16.348
Duty should have dictated
that we behave differently.

52:16.449 --> 52:18.951
Why didn't we?

52:19.052 --> 52:21.987
In France, I had an assistant.

52:22.088 --> 52:24.456
He was a young man
they called Mufig.

52:24.558 --> 52:27.059
Smelly.

52:27.160 --> 52:30.062
And he loved the smell of
old lady's perfume.

52:30.163 --> 52:33.866
He would douse himself
in the stuff.

52:33.967 --> 52:37.636
Then one night,
after a night out,

52:37.737 --> 52:41.807
this old lady comes up to Mufig
and compliments him

52:41.908 --> 52:43.542
on his smell.

52:43.643 --> 52:46.579
Mufig proceeds to ask
the old lady out.

52:46.680 --> 52:50.482
She accepts and they go
on a date.

52:50.584 --> 52:54.620
Mufig comes back
from the date

52:54.721 --> 52:56.755
and he can't stop
proclaiming his love.

52:56.857 --> 52:58.657
"I love her, I love her".

52:58.758 --> 53:00.793
We all think he's lost
his mind.

53:11.771 --> 53:16.075
I've come to find out that

53:16.176 --> 53:22.681
this old lady had a daughter
the same age as Mufig.

53:22.782 --> 53:25.751
Beautiful.

53:25.852 --> 53:30.723
Four days later
they were married.

53:30.824 --> 53:38.063
When I asked him why he would do
such a thing,

53:38.164 --> 53:43.969
he told me he wanted to know
what it was like

53:44.070 --> 53:52.111
to experience true love
before he died.

53:54.581 --> 54:02.521
Weeks later Mufig put himself
between me and a grenade.

54:02.622 --> 54:08.394
Saved my life.

54:08.495 --> 54:12.398
I've never known true love.

54:12.499 --> 54:15.434
Was he right?

54:15.535 --> 54:21.373
Myers, my wife is the most
important thing

54:21.474 --> 54:23.709
in the world to me.

54:23.810 --> 54:29.315
I would do anything for her,
even betray my country.

54:29.416 --> 54:31.984
So yes,

54:32.085 --> 54:40.159
to die and to not know true love
is a tragedy.

54:44.397 --> 54:46.765
Myers,

54:46.866 --> 54:50.569
I think one day I will have
that ranch in Texas.

54:50.670 --> 54:52.571
Keep in mind my army
is closer to Berlin

54:52.672 --> 54:55.007
than yours is to Dallas.

55:10.357 --> 55:18.430
Three aces.

55:19.666 --> 55:22.468
Oh, come on!

55:35.682 --> 55:36.448
Excuse me.

55:36.549 --> 55:37.416
Yes.

55:37.517 --> 55:38.317
It's Peter, right?

55:38.418 --> 55:38.917
Yeah.

55:39.019 --> 55:40.219
May I?

55:40.320 --> 55:41.887
Of course, my Captain.

55:41.988 --> 55:44.923
I'm sorry, Alina,
he outranks me.

55:45.025 --> 55:46.692
Thank you.

55:51.765 --> 55:53.399
I'm sorry.

55:56.603 --> 55:59.638
May I have this dance?

56:10.350 --> 56:12.918
Very beautiful.

56:13.019 --> 56:16.221
You think charm and a smile
wins me back over?

56:16.322 --> 56:19.591
No, ma'am, I was counting on
more than that.

56:19.692 --> 56:25.798
You know, I haven't danced
since before the war.

56:25.899 --> 56:28.233
I would have never guessed.

56:28.334 --> 56:31.603
And I guess you frequented
the dance halls.

56:31.704 --> 56:33.739
No. I'm looking for more.

56:33.840 --> 56:34.506
Than what?

56:34.607 --> 56:36.542
A pretty face.

56:45.618 --> 56:48.787
Captain Myers.

56:48.888 --> 56:52.658
How can there be a tomorrow?

56:52.759 --> 57:00.566
Time must stand still and give
us this moment a little longer.

57:45.778 --> 57:47.779
<i>Thank you, Monsieur Dubois,</i>
<i>for walking me back.</i>

57:47.881 --> 57:51.650
You can call me Pierre.

57:51.751 --> 57:54.820
It was my pleasure.

57:57.757 --> 57:59.324
Thank you.

58:04.364 --> 58:05.998
Alina?

58:11.738 --> 58:14.339
Oh, I didn't think you
would be here.

58:14.440 --> 58:17.376
The wine, I was tired
so I came back alone.

58:25.418 --> 58:31.723
Yeah, the French wine
always goes to my head.

58:31.824 --> 58:33.992
Where is Captain Myers?

58:34.093 --> 58:36.495
I didn't see him when I left.

58:36.596 --> 58:38.430
What am I, his keeper?

58:38.531 --> 58:41.300
I'm very happy that you met
someone that you like.

58:41.401 --> 58:42.568
Who would that be?

58:42.669 --> 58:44.336
I wish you would find someone
more stable.

58:44.437 --> 58:45.537
Stable!

58:45.638 --> 58:48.574
Mother, the animals,
they still need feeding.

58:48.675 --> 58:50.809
When the sun rises.

58:50.910 --> 58:54.713
Daylight allows you
to see things better.

58:54.814 --> 59:02.321
And you have either love
or regret.

59:05.525 --> 59:08.660
Oh, Peter's borscht.

59:08.761 --> 59:09.828
Push me.

59:09.929 --> 59:11.496
One, two, three!

59:11.598 --> 59:15.834
Ok, I'm better.

59:15.935 --> 59:17.636
I'll be back.

59:23.376 --> 59:24.610
Are you alright?

59:26.713 --> 59:29.648
I should have worn my helmet.

59:29.749 --> 59:32.517
My mother will be back quickly.

59:32.619 --> 59:33.852
How?

59:35.888 --> 59:36.488
I'll sneak out.

59:36.589 --> 59:37.522
Alright.

59:37.624 --> 59:39.258
You better come quick.

59:54.741 --> 59:57.876
Goodnight, Captain.

59:57.977 --> 59:59.911
Goodnight.

01:00:01.347 --> 01:00:04.283
Carpe diem!

01:00:59.405 --> 01:01:01.807
Captain?

01:01:01.908 --> 01:01:04.376
Go get some rest.
It's my watch.

01:01:18.057 --> 01:01:18.623
Hurry!

01:01:18.725 --> 01:01:20.492
I'm trying, I'm trying!

01:01:34.374 --> 01:01:35.640
I'm sorry,

01:01:35.742 --> 01:01:37.509
my mother was up all night.

01:01:37.610 --> 01:01:39.611
I couldn't get away.

01:01:44.617 --> 01:01:45.817
We don't have time,
the sun is coming up.

01:01:45.918 --> 01:01:46.918
Time must wait.

01:01:47.019 --> 01:01:48.887
It has to.

01:01:52.759 --> 01:01:54.526
<i>Alina!</i>

01:01:54.627 --> 01:01:55.861
What does she want?

01:02:00.032 --> 01:02:01.433
Alina!

01:02:02.335 --> 01:02:02.868
What is it?

01:02:02.969 --> 01:02:03.802
Hey, what's going on?

01:02:03.903 --> 01:02:04.569
They're coming!

01:02:04.670 --> 01:02:05.270
Who's coming?

01:02:05.371 --> 01:02:06.571
The Germans!

01:02:06.672 --> 01:02:08.974
Outside of the village about
200 troops and a dozen tanks.

01:02:09.075 --> 01:02:09.741
They lied!

01:02:09.842 --> 01:02:11.576
What's all the excitement about?

01:02:11.677 --> 01:02:12.944
We've been double-crossed.

01:02:13.045 --> 01:02:14.012
We grab our gear,
we move now.

01:02:14.113 --> 01:02:15.480
Halt!

01:02:19.952 --> 01:02:21.787
Reinforcements are moving in.

01:02:21.888 --> 01:02:24.222
Once they arrive
there's nothing I can do.

01:02:24.323 --> 01:02:25.924
Now move!

01:02:26.025 --> 01:02:27.592
Wait! I have some gifts for you.

01:02:27.693 --> 01:02:28.660
Come on.

01:02:28.761 --> 01:02:30.662
I will help.

01:02:42.375 --> 01:02:44.409
Perhaps we'll meet again.

01:02:44.510 --> 01:02:45.444
In better times

01:02:45.545 --> 01:02:46.845
when we can be friends
rather than enemies.

01:02:46.946 --> 01:02:48.647
I'd like that.

01:02:48.748 --> 01:02:49.948
Hey.

01:02:51.984 --> 01:02:52.951
Here.

01:02:56.689 --> 01:02:57.856
The American artillery.

01:02:57.957 --> 01:02:59.324
Why are they shooting at us?

01:02:59.425 --> 01:03:02.961
It's not us they're
trying to hit.

01:03:03.062 --> 01:03:04.463
I've got something for you,
as well.

01:03:04.564 --> 01:03:06.364
I finished it last night.

01:03:07.099 --> 01:03:09.401
War, mystery,

01:03:09.502 --> 01:03:11.036
a little romance...

01:03:57.717 --> 01:03:59.951
We have to go!

01:04:00.052 --> 01:04:00.886
Alina!

01:04:00.987 --> 01:04:02.954
We have to go!

01:04:16.802 --> 01:04:19.738
When will I see you again?

01:04:19.839 --> 01:04:20.739
Christmas Eve,

01:04:20.840 --> 01:04:22.707
after the war ends,
no matter who wins,

01:04:22.808 --> 01:04:26.411
if you're willing and able meet
me in the church at midnight!

01:04:26.512 --> 01:04:27.646
It's the best time!

01:04:28.814 --> 01:04:29.948
Alina! Down!!

01:04:31.784 --> 01:04:34.553
Alina! Alina!!

01:04:34.654 --> 01:04:37.589
Alina, come!

01:04:37.690 --> 01:04:38.623
Myers!

01:04:38.724 --> 01:04:40.225
Alina!

01:04:40.326 --> 01:04:41.693
Let's go!

01:04:42.762 --> 01:04:44.729
We have to go, let's go!

01:04:58.311 --> 01:04:59.844
How are we supposed to get
across that?

01:05:06.686 --> 01:05:07.786
I think we lost them.

01:05:10.556 --> 01:05:11.323
Is he ok?

01:05:11.424 --> 01:05:13.358
No, he's not ok.

01:05:13.459 --> 01:05:14.826
His wound opened up.

01:05:14.927 --> 01:05:17.629
It's fine. It's ok.

01:05:32.011 --> 01:05:33.511
<i>Captain Myers.</i>

01:05:33.613 --> 01:05:35.847
<i>I never thought love would</i>
<i>find me,</i>

01:05:35.948 --> 01:05:39.551
<i>nor did I expect it to be</i>
<i>dressed in a uniform.</i>

01:05:39.652 --> 01:05:43.588
<i>But I can't deny love</i>
<i>has discovered my heart</i>

01:05:43.689 --> 01:05:44.756
<i>and there you are.</i>

01:05:44.857 --> 01:05:47.959
<i>Please, fight for me, John,</i>

01:05:48.060 --> 01:05:51.496
<i>and come to your home</i>
<i>in my arms.</i>

01:05:51.597 --> 01:05:55.433
<i>Merry Christmas, with love,</i>
<i>Alina.</i>

01:05:59.972 --> 01:06:02.807
Hey.

01:06:02.908 --> 01:06:05.243
Hey Captain, how are you
holding up?

01:06:05.344 --> 01:06:06.611
You ok?

01:06:06.712 --> 01:06:07.679
I saw her fall.

01:06:07.780 --> 01:06:10.348
I made a promise to keep
her safe but she fell.

01:06:10.449 --> 01:06:12.651
Myers, let me go with Dubois.

01:06:12.752 --> 01:06:14.619
You take Jensen back,
give them a report.

01:06:14.720 --> 01:06:15.787
I can't.

01:06:15.888 --> 01:06:17.389
Look, blowing that bridge is
suicidal, you know that.

01:06:17.490 --> 01:06:18.390
You're putting on
a German uniform,

01:06:18.491 --> 01:06:19.257
they'll shoot you if-

01:06:19.358 --> 01:06:20.625
I have to go back!

01:06:20.726 --> 01:06:21.693
What do you mean, go back?

01:06:21.794 --> 01:06:22.460
I have a commitment!

01:06:22.561 --> 01:06:24.796
Yes, to complete this mission!

01:06:24.897 --> 01:06:25.930
And we will.

01:06:26.032 --> 01:06:29.334
You meet me in Dasburg in
the park near the bridge.

01:06:31.270 --> 01:06:33.505
I'm going back in Wereth
as a German,

01:06:33.606 --> 01:06:34.472
they'll never know.

01:06:34.573 --> 01:06:35.273
Oh yeah?

01:06:35.374 --> 01:06:36.174
Then what?

01:06:36.275 --> 01:06:37.609
I find Alina and make sure
she's ok.

01:06:37.710 --> 01:06:38.643
You can't go back!

01:06:38.744 --> 01:06:39.711
I made her a promise!

01:06:39.812 --> 01:06:40.612
You obey your orders!

01:06:40.713 --> 01:06:42.514
You don't make this call!

01:06:48.788 --> 01:06:51.790
They killed my family.

01:06:51.891 --> 01:06:53.425
The bomb fell,

01:06:53.526 --> 01:06:57.429
my family, I never
saw them again.

01:06:57.530 --> 01:06:59.264
This is my chance.

01:06:59.365 --> 01:07:00.865
This is my chance
to get them back.

01:07:00.966 --> 01:07:03.468
To make a difference.

01:07:03.569 --> 01:07:08.840
I will not let you
screw this up.

01:07:08.941 --> 01:07:11.710
Remember your duty.

01:07:11.811 --> 01:07:15.714
What if you had a chance
to save your family?

01:07:15.815 --> 01:07:18.817
Would you give that up
in the name of duty?

01:07:18.918 --> 01:07:21.720
I promise we will finish
this mission,

01:07:21.821 --> 01:07:25.590
but after I find Alina
and make sure she's safe.

01:07:34.266 --> 01:07:36.534
The park near the bridge.

01:07:42.041 --> 01:07:43.708
Hey, Captain?

01:07:45.411 --> 01:07:46.644
Next time I see you,

01:07:46.746 --> 01:07:49.314
you'll sign that transfer
report, right?

01:07:49.415 --> 01:07:51.816
Next time I see you
we'll talk about it.

01:08:07.683 --> 01:08:11.219
Alina? Alina?

01:09:11.714 --> 01:09:13.581
I have served Germany
and will continue to do so

01:09:13.682 --> 01:09:14.682
until the day I die.

01:09:14.783 --> 01:09:16.584
Berlin received word
of your truce.

01:09:16.685 --> 01:09:17.952
Hitler should be worried
about the allied

01:09:18.053 --> 01:09:19.687
counter-attack, not me.

01:09:19.787 --> 01:09:21.221
Your words are grounds
for a court marshall.

01:09:21.323 --> 01:09:22.223
I will see you hanged.

01:09:22.323 --> 01:09:23.424
Do as you will.

01:09:23.526 --> 01:09:26.426
I will only abandon my men
when I am dead.

01:09:26.529 --> 01:09:28.696
Herr Oberst.

01:09:28.796 --> 01:09:29.363
A message.

01:09:29.465 --> 01:09:32.433
I should shoot you now.

01:09:32.535 --> 01:09:34.368
I have a war to fight.

01:09:34.470 --> 01:09:36.270
If you're done,
get out.

01:09:36.372 --> 01:09:39.274
This is not over,
Herr Oberst.

01:09:39.375 --> 01:09:40.942
Hail Hitler!

01:09:44.913 --> 01:09:45.613
Verify this.

01:09:45.714 --> 01:09:46.613
I have.

01:09:46.715 --> 01:09:48.649
Reports have been taken
by the Americana.

01:09:48.751 --> 01:09:49.517
Verify it again!

01:09:49.618 --> 01:09:51.386
I want to know
the exact location

01:09:51.487 --> 01:09:53.787
and which American
unit took them!

01:09:53.889 --> 01:09:55.323
Now!

01:10:18.714 --> 01:10:19.714
<i>Myers!!!!</i>

01:10:21.884 --> 01:10:24.285
You fool! What did you do
with that...?

01:10:31.694 --> 01:10:32.694
What did you do with Alina?

01:10:32.795 --> 01:10:35.730
Where did you take her?

01:10:35.831 --> 01:10:37.765
<i>I came for Alina! Please!</i>

01:10:37.866 --> 01:10:38.967
Is that the American?

01:10:39.068 --> 01:10:40.335
Yes, I think so.

01:10:40.436 --> 01:10:42.904
Come, we must hurry.

01:10:43.005 --> 01:10:43.938
You took her!

01:10:44.039 --> 01:10:44.839
Shut up!

01:10:44.940 --> 01:10:45.974
Is she safe?

01:10:46.075 --> 01:10:47.275
Do not touch to me!

01:10:47.376 --> 01:10:48.543
Shut up!

01:10:50.079 --> 01:10:53.414
I told you coming back here
would only mean death!

01:10:53.515 --> 01:10:54.949
Truce, please!

01:10:55.050 --> 01:10:56.517
I love her!

01:11:24.613 --> 01:11:28.583
I ordered the evacuation
of the village.

01:11:28.684 --> 01:11:33.821
I sent Alina north along
with my family.

01:11:33.922 --> 01:11:37.458
I just received a report
that Americans attacked the unit

01:11:37.559 --> 01:11:39.994
they were with,
and took them.

01:11:47.770 --> 01:11:49.871
For me,

01:11:49.972 --> 01:11:57.679
I ask that you find Lilly
and give her this letter.

01:11:57.780 --> 01:11:59.447
Myers...

01:11:59.548 --> 01:12:02.283
for your life,

01:12:02.384 --> 01:12:06.521
promise me that
you will do this.

01:12:06.622 --> 01:12:08.456
I promise.

01:12:10.426 --> 01:12:11.659
Don't come back.

01:12:11.760 --> 01:12:13.227
There's only death here.

01:12:13.328 --> 01:12:14.996
Now go, quickly!

01:12:24.306 --> 01:12:26.874
Halt! Halt!

01:12:26.975 --> 01:12:29.310
Would you like us to check
for a body?

01:12:29.411 --> 01:12:31.312
No.

01:12:31.413 --> 01:12:33.715
That spy is our gift
to the wolves.

01:12:33.816 --> 01:12:35.583
We have orders to go back
to the front lines.

01:12:35.684 --> 01:12:37.218
Gather the men.

01:12:37.319 --> 01:12:38.986
Ja.

01:13:01.410 --> 01:13:02.977
She worth it?

01:13:07.349 --> 01:13:09.016
Yes.

01:13:12.588 --> 01:13:15.723
Promise me something.

01:13:15.824 --> 01:13:21.896
Let's blow this bridge
and then go home.

01:13:21.997 --> 01:13:25.233
Yeah, I like the sound of that.

01:13:45.487 --> 01:13:46.687
I want this over here, please.

01:13:46.789 --> 01:13:49.257
And I want the beer
over there.

01:13:49.358 --> 01:13:51.659
Peter?

01:13:51.760 --> 01:13:53.895
Ah, schnukifrutz.

01:13:59.401 --> 01:14:02.870
<i>After the war I searched for</i>
<i>John Myers in France</i>

01:14:02.971 --> 01:14:05.239
<i>but instead I found</i>
<i>Lieutenant Berkowitz</i>

01:14:05.340 --> 01:14:06.641
<i>who joined me on</i>
<i>his Christmas leave</i>

01:14:06.742 --> 01:14:09.644
<i>in hopes that he too</i>
<i>would see Myers again.</i>

01:14:09.745 --> 01:14:11.913
Never thought I'd be back here.

01:14:12.014 --> 01:14:14.916
It's rather surreal.

01:14:15.017 --> 01:14:16.684
Alina! Is it you?

01:14:16.785 --> 01:14:17.718
Peter.

01:14:17.820 --> 01:14:18.586
Alina.

01:14:18.687 --> 01:14:19.787
How are you?

01:14:20.789 --> 01:14:21.489
Alina!

01:14:21.590 --> 01:14:22.323
And you!

01:14:22.424 --> 01:14:23.257
Hello there.

01:14:23.358 --> 01:14:24.492
So surprised to see you!

01:14:24.593 --> 01:14:25.426
<i>Alina found me in France.</i>

01:14:25.527 --> 01:14:26.194
Did you two marry?

01:14:26.295 --> 01:14:28.763
Our anniversary is next week.

01:14:28.864 --> 01:14:30.431
Lovely.

01:14:33.535 --> 01:14:35.169
Have you seen
Captain John Myers?

01:14:35.270 --> 01:14:36.971
I thought maybe...

01:14:40.475 --> 01:14:42.677
I'm sorry, Alina,

01:14:42.778 --> 01:14:46.180
but I saw Myers after you left.

01:14:46.281 --> 01:14:48.182
We believe Braun killed him.

01:14:48.283 --> 01:14:48.916
That can't be.

01:14:49.017 --> 01:14:51.485
That's impossible.

01:14:51.587 --> 01:14:52.787
No, he was reported missing

01:14:52.888 --> 01:14:56.224
after the bridge
in Dasburg fell.

01:14:56.325 --> 01:14:58.926
I know what I saw.

01:14:59.027 --> 01:15:01.929
We heard the gunshots.

01:15:02.030 --> 01:15:03.898
Alina Anne!

01:15:03.999 --> 01:15:05.766
Father?

01:15:09.972 --> 01:15:11.839
I thought I'd never
see you again!

01:15:11.940 --> 01:15:13.875
I prayed every night
that I would hold you again.

01:15:13.976 --> 01:15:16.344
What a wonderful Christmas gift!

01:15:16.445 --> 01:15:19.814
Alina!

01:15:19.915 --> 01:15:23.885
We were so happy
to get your message.

01:15:23.986 --> 01:15:25.820
You look marvelous.

01:15:25.921 --> 01:15:27.788
Ya.

01:15:27.890 --> 01:15:28.689
Henry.

01:15:28.790 --> 01:15:31.292
Peter!

01:15:31.393 --> 01:15:33.661
Oh, my goodness.

01:15:53.415 --> 01:15:55.483
And they have appointed
Peter mayor for now.

01:15:55.584 --> 01:15:56.984
That's wonderful news!

01:15:57.085 --> 01:15:58.719
Isn't it, Alina?

01:16:01.757 --> 01:16:03.691
Alina?

01:16:03.792 --> 01:16:05.426
Sorry.

01:16:05.527 --> 01:16:07.628
I was to meet someone tonight.

01:16:07.729 --> 01:16:10.331
Ah, the American.

01:16:10.432 --> 01:16:13.567
Yes, your mother told me
about him.

01:16:13.669 --> 01:16:17.438
I don't suppose
he's come round yet?

01:16:17.539 --> 01:16:19.707
The army believes he destroyed
the bridge in Dasburg,

01:16:19.808 --> 01:16:22.777
but maybe they were wrong.

01:16:22.878 --> 01:16:26.414
Well then, the boy's a hero.

01:16:26.515 --> 01:16:29.784
Darling, no matter
the outcome,

01:16:29.885 --> 01:16:33.721
you have been touched by love.

01:16:33.822 --> 01:16:35.222
That reminds me of the time

01:16:35.324 --> 01:16:38.859
I met your mother
after the great war...

01:16:38.961 --> 01:16:40.962
Alina?

01:16:41.063 --> 01:16:42.930
Myers!

01:16:43.031 --> 01:16:44.799
Excuse me.

01:16:44.900 --> 01:16:46.400
Yes, of course.

01:17:10.625 --> 01:17:11.926
Myers?

01:17:14.429 --> 01:17:15.896
Alina!

01:17:15.998 --> 01:17:17.431
What are you doing
in his coat?

01:17:17.532 --> 01:17:19.533
Why do you have it?

01:17:19.634 --> 01:17:20.868
You killed him!

01:17:20.969 --> 01:17:22.436
Killed who?

01:17:22.537 --> 01:17:23.771
John Myers!

01:17:23.872 --> 01:17:25.272
No, Alina.

01:17:25.374 --> 01:17:26.273
No!

01:17:26.375 --> 01:17:28.576
He came back to save you.

01:17:28.677 --> 01:17:31.345
He was dressed as
a German soldier.

01:17:31.446 --> 01:17:33.481
It was my duty to kill him,

01:17:35.350 --> 01:17:37.551
but I spared his life.

01:17:37.652 --> 01:17:39.587
The coat, it
was my father's,

01:17:39.688 --> 01:17:41.389
I gave it to Myers!

01:17:41.490 --> 01:17:43.924
And he gave it to my son.

01:17:44.026 --> 01:17:47.728
It has kept me warm
for the last year.

01:17:47.829 --> 01:17:49.530
How is it you're here?

01:17:49.631 --> 01:17:53.501
I was captured by the British
near Malmedy.

01:17:53.602 --> 01:18:00.341
They put me in a camp
run by the Russians.

01:18:00.442 --> 01:18:02.743
It was a horrible place.

01:18:02.844 --> 01:18:07.448
Last week they dragged me
and three other men

01:18:07.549 --> 01:18:10.818
out through the front gates.

01:18:10.919 --> 01:18:13.621
I had seen it all before.

01:18:13.722 --> 01:18:17.024
The shallow graves.

01:18:17.125 --> 01:18:19.994
They shot the man to my left

01:18:20.095 --> 01:18:25.533
and then they shot
the man to my right.

01:18:25.634 --> 01:18:29.370
But my bullet never came.

01:18:29.471 --> 01:18:34.909
They said to leave and I ran
and I never looked back.

01:18:35.010 --> 01:18:38.412
I made her the same promise
that you made to Myers.

01:18:38.513 --> 01:18:42.516
That we would return here
after the war on Christmas Eve

01:18:42.617 --> 01:18:44.819
to be reunited again.

01:18:44.920 --> 01:18:46.687
I know.

01:18:46.788 --> 01:18:50.925
We were taken to France
by the Americans.

01:18:51.026 --> 01:18:52.860
Lilly gave me this.

01:18:54.996 --> 01:18:57.765
I never thought I'd deliver it.

01:19:06.441 --> 01:19:12.346
Philip is in an orphanage
in Mount St. Claire.

01:19:12.447 --> 01:19:14.548
Lilly has an infection.

01:19:14.649 --> 01:19:17.551
She's dying.

01:19:17.652 --> 01:19:19.253
She's probably already gone.

01:19:28.530 --> 01:19:36.437
God, look after those
whom we've lost.

01:19:36.538 --> 01:19:41.041
And thank you for bringing back
my father.

01:19:41.143 --> 01:19:43.477
Thank you for the peace.

01:19:47.048 --> 01:19:48.916
The peace.

01:19:49.985 --> 01:19:52.386
Josef?

01:19:52.487 --> 01:19:53.854
Josef?

01:19:57.726 --> 01:19:59.326
Lilly!

01:20:08.570 --> 01:20:09.403
Your letter.

01:20:09.504 --> 01:20:10.938
Death has spared me.

01:20:11.039 --> 01:20:13.774
Thank god!

01:20:13.875 --> 01:20:14.642
My son.

01:20:14.743 --> 01:20:16.343
Papa!

01:20:21.983 --> 01:20:24.318
Alina.

01:20:24.419 --> 01:20:26.987
I never did thank you properly.

01:20:27.088 --> 01:20:28.455
Another time, then.

01:20:28.557 --> 01:20:32.726
No, I must.

01:20:32.827 --> 01:20:37.831
My family is together again
because of your bravery.

01:20:37.933 --> 01:20:41.936
I will forever be in your debt.

01:20:42.037 --> 01:20:43.904
But it wasn't me.

01:20:44.005 --> 01:20:50.778
Your love to Captain Myers
saved us all.

01:20:50.879 --> 01:20:56.050
Too many good men have died
so that others may live.

01:21:05.393 --> 01:21:06.994
Will you join us?

01:21:07.095 --> 01:21:09.830
Yes. In a moment.

01:21:32.454 --> 01:21:34.622
Oh, Peter.

01:21:34.723 --> 01:21:36.857
Not now.

01:22:23.471 --> 01:22:28.742
I loved with a love
that was more than love

01:22:28.843 --> 01:22:34.915
and I found what was lost.

01:22:35.016 --> 01:22:38.952
Never will I lose you again.

01:22:39.054 --> 01:22:41.455
Poe didn't write it like that.

01:22:41.556 --> 01:22:43.757
My way is true.

01:22:43.858 --> 01:22:45.659
Jonathan Myers.

01:22:55.837 --> 01:22:57.871
They said you were dead.

01:22:57.972 --> 01:23:00.374
I was busy, first with
the Germans,

01:23:00.475 --> 01:23:02.776
then with the Russians.

01:23:02.877 --> 01:23:04.712
Captain Myers.

01:23:10.452 --> 01:23:12.353
You know, it takes a lot
of whiskey and cigarettes

01:23:12.454 --> 01:23:15.389
for the Russians to release
a German POW.

01:23:15.490 --> 01:23:16.990
That was you?

01:23:17.092 --> 01:23:18.292
You freed me?

01:23:18.393 --> 01:23:20.561
But why? Why me?

01:23:20.662 --> 01:23:23.397
Because I made a promise.

01:23:23.498 --> 01:23:28.268
I thought you should give Lilly
the letter yourself.

01:23:29.671 --> 01:23:31.405
Danke ma bruder.

01:23:33.908 --> 01:23:35.743
Myers.

01:23:36.978 --> 01:23:39.279
This is my father.

01:23:39.381 --> 01:23:41.315
I've heard a lot about you, sir.

01:23:41.416 --> 01:23:43.317
Oh, don't mind about me, boy.

01:23:43.418 --> 01:23:45.319
Men like you make a difference.

01:23:45.420 --> 01:23:46.987
I was just doing my part.

01:23:47.088 --> 01:23:49.723
A toast to Captain Myers.

01:23:49.824 --> 01:23:51.558
No, no, no.

01:23:51.659 --> 01:23:54.495
To my family!

01:23:57.399 --> 01:24:01.368
Say now, isn't that my coat?

01:24:01.469 --> 01:24:02.936
Ya.

01:24:03.037 --> 01:24:04.538
Danke.

01:24:19.587 --> 01:24:21.388
You.

01:24:25.894 --> 01:24:27.728
I have a gift for you.

01:24:27.829 --> 01:24:29.530
Open it.

01:24:37.639 --> 01:24:39.506
But it was burned.

01:24:39.607 --> 01:24:43.944
Only the title page so it's
identity could be kept secret.

01:24:44.045 --> 01:24:47.948
Your words I kept very close
to my heart.

01:24:48.049 --> 01:24:50.284
Thank you.

01:24:52.821 --> 01:24:56.857
I've been practicing these words
for a very long time.

01:25:02.430 --> 01:25:05.599
I've been without a home.

01:25:05.700 --> 01:25:12.873
I never found refuge
or what it meant to love.

01:25:12.974 --> 01:25:15.976
I once thought that my journey
was going to be a futile search

01:25:16.077 --> 01:25:19.346
to heal my broken heart.

01:25:19.447 --> 01:25:22.950
I was wrong.

01:25:23.051 --> 01:25:26.353
That journey ended in a little
town called Wereth.

01:25:29.824 --> 01:25:33.494
I found my home in your arms.

01:25:33.595 --> 01:25:36.997
No matter where life
may lead us,

01:25:37.098 --> 01:25:42.936
as long as I can stand
by your side

01:25:43.037 --> 01:25:51.111
and have the honour
to call you my wife,

01:25:52.981 --> 01:25:59.386
I promise to always protect you.

01:25:59.487 --> 01:26:03.657
Please, give me this honour.

01:26:03.758 --> 01:26:07.895
Will you marry me,
Alina Anne Hamlin?

01:26:09.631 --> 01:26:14.902
I don't ever want to lose
you again.

01:26:38.026 --> 01:26:39.493
Why are they ringing!

01:26:39.594 --> 01:26:41.562
They toll for you!

01:26:46.768 --> 01:26:49.236
Merci, Dubois.

01:26:49.337 --> 01:26:50.938
Carpe Diem!
