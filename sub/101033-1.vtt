00:04.303 --> 00:05.553
Previously on  The Chi...

00:05.637 --> 00:07.720
You got the chain
that I gave him.

00:07.804 --> 00:08.929
Take the fucking chain, then.

00:09.011 --> 00:10.929
- Take it!
-

00:11.845 --> 00:12.595
Every time I think about you,

00:12.679 --> 00:13.970
I wish something bad on you.

00:14.053 --> 00:15.887
I'm really sorry for
killing your little brother.

00:15.970 --> 00:18.929
Man, Coogie was just...

00:19.011 --> 00:20.720
so much better than me,
you know?

00:20.804 --> 00:22.053
I kissed her,

00:22.136 --> 00:23.887
but I only did it
'cause I felt sorry for her.

00:23.970 --> 00:26.011
Maisha, look, I didn't--

00:27.178 --> 00:30.929
You need to tell us who
gave you the drugs, Kevin.

00:31.011 --> 00:33.303
I'm not snitching.
I'm done doing that.

00:33.387 --> 00:35.303
Mrs. Williams, this
is exactly why I recommend

00:35.387 --> 00:39.095
you consider sending him
to Chicago North Side Academy.

00:42.303 --> 00:44.345
- Ma!
-  Oh!

00:44.428 --> 00:46.804
Da-Darn--
Oh, what the fuck?

00:47.762 --> 00:50.428
And you did this
all by yourself?

00:50.512 --> 00:53.220
Yeah, we can figure
this shit out together.

00:53.303 --> 00:55.011
-  Five laps. Let's go.

00:56.804 --> 00:58.178
Get a move on, Williams.

00:59.303 --> 01:00.845
You're laggin' behind.

01:08.553 --> 01:10.261
Look, I don't have
nothing to do with this.

01:10.345 --> 01:13.387
I understand you're scared,
but I will handle this.

01:14.679 --> 01:16.345
Miss Ethel's home invasion,

01:16.428 --> 01:18.845
gang's proceeds
from dope and guns,

01:18.929 --> 01:20.261
and he's the scorpion.

01:22.261 --> 01:25.178
Hey, I remember you.

01:25.261 --> 01:27.136
You gave a pizza party
at my school.

01:27.220 --> 01:29.220
How's school going anyway?

01:29.303 --> 01:30.762
It's good, I guess.

01:30.845 --> 01:34.011
Oh, we gotta be doing
a lot better than "I guess."

01:34.095 --> 01:35.512
I'd like to give Jake a job.

01:35.595 --> 01:36.595
What the fuck
he gonna do here?

01:36.679 --> 01:38.762
Don't underestimate
your little brother.

01:38.845 --> 01:40.762
Let me ask you
something, Douda.

01:40.845 --> 01:42.428
Is there anything
that I can do different?

01:42.512 --> 01:43.720
You have nothing
to worry about.

01:51.011 --> 01:53.804
"Endless Love" playing

01:59.720 --> 02:04.345
in my life

02:04.428 --> 02:08.679
that's right

02:10.136 --> 02:11.470
Your sister's late.

02:11.553 --> 02:12.762
I knew it.
She's gonna ruin my wedding.

02:12.845 --> 02:15.053
Calm down, Ma.
She's probably on her way.

02:15.136 --> 02:16.679
I asked her to do one thing,
be on time.

02:16.762 --> 02:17.929
She couldn't even do that.

02:18.011 --> 02:19.387
Okay, but you
weren't prompt either.

02:19.470 --> 02:20.845
The wedding was supposed
to start an hour ago.

02:20.929 --> 02:23.303
So? I'm the bride.
I can be late.

02:25.762 --> 02:29.845
-

02:42.804 --> 02:44.845
-

03:19.595 --> 03:23.887
as one

03:29.845 --> 03:34.595
-

03:34.679 --> 03:39.553
in my arms

03:40.970 --> 03:42.553
If you can't hustle
in them heels,

03:42.637 --> 03:44.136
you should've wore flats.

03:44.220 --> 03:45.762
Shut up.
You're the one who decided

03:45.845 --> 03:47.970
to cut your own hair
at the last minute.

03:48.053 --> 03:50.887
I can't go to a wedding
without a fresh line up.

03:50.970 --> 03:53.428
Who you think I am,
Steph Curry?

03:54.512 --> 03:57.679
I thought I knew
what love was my whole life,

03:57.762 --> 04:00.220
but then I found you,

04:00.303 --> 04:03.136
and you taught me
the true definition

04:03.220 --> 04:06.053
of what it means
to be loved completely.

04:06.136 --> 04:08.845
I never thought
I would want to remarry.

04:08.929 --> 04:12.095
I thought if I was lucky enough
to find love once...

04:12.178 --> 04:13.845
I can't believe
you made me late

04:13.929 --> 04:15.470
for my own friend's wedding.

04:15.553 --> 04:17.929
You wouldn't even know Dre
if it wasn't for me.

04:18.011 --> 04:20.345
Yeah, you probably
the reason she gay.

04:20.428 --> 04:21.512
Bullshit.

04:22.762 --> 04:25.720
I ain't turn her gay.
She always been gay.

04:25.804 --> 04:27.637
I was just a speed bump
on her way

04:27.720 --> 04:30.095
to the island of Lesbos.

04:31.762 --> 04:33.178
At this time,

04:33.261 --> 04:35.887
Dre would like
to share a few words.

04:35.970 --> 04:37.887
Ay.

04:37.970 --> 04:39.553
Something I wanna say
to both of you.

04:40.970 --> 04:43.804
I know y'all didn't get
a chance to pick me.

04:43.887 --> 04:45.053
Your mother did.

04:46.178 --> 04:48.220
But when I chose your mother,

04:48.303 --> 04:49.387
I chose y'all too.

04:50.970 --> 04:52.178
I want you to know
that I can't wait

04:52.261 --> 04:54.178
to be a part of this family.

04:55.053 --> 04:58.762
Kiesha, I know we don't
always see eye to eye.

05:00.428 --> 05:02.804
But I have a lot
of respect for you.

05:02.887 --> 05:04.804
You're a strong woman,
just like your moms.

05:05.887 --> 05:07.428
You're smart,
and you got a good heart.

05:08.929 --> 05:11.387
And, Kevin, whew,

05:11.470 --> 05:13.804
boy, you've been through
a lot these past few years.

05:15.011 --> 05:17.762
But you're still
the bravest person I know,

05:17.845 --> 05:20.428
and you're not afraid
to go after whatever you want.

05:20.512 --> 05:22.303
Keep that energy.

05:23.136 --> 05:24.387
I look forward to all
the wonderful things

05:24.470 --> 05:27.136
that's gonna happen
in your lives.

05:27.220 --> 05:29.220
I want you to both know
that I'll be here for you,

05:29.303 --> 05:30.970
anything you need.

05:31.053 --> 05:33.970
So...I got y'all
a little something.

05:45.553 --> 05:48.011
Oh! Oh.
Is this real gold?

05:48.095 --> 05:49.804
Yes, sir.

05:49.887 --> 05:51.595
Twenty-four karats.

05:51.679 --> 05:53.553
It's engraved
with the longitude and latitude

05:53.637 --> 05:55.387
of our house,

05:55.470 --> 05:58.929
so no matter
where you are in the world...

05:59.011 --> 06:00.762
you can always
find your way home.

06:03.762 --> 06:05.720
I love both of y'all
with my whole heart.

06:08.637 --> 06:10.470
Thanks.

06:11.929 --> 06:15.261
By the power granted to me
by the state of Illinois,

06:15.345 --> 06:18.428
I now pronounce you
two honest women

06:18.512 --> 06:21.345
who are no longer shacking up
out of wedlock.

06:21.428 --> 06:22.887
Congratulations.

06:32.720 --> 06:34.512
Whoo!

06:40.220 --> 06:44.053
get you off my mind

06:45.512 --> 06:47.845
- Why we ain't never do that?
- Do what?

06:47.929 --> 06:49.512
Get married.

06:49.595 --> 06:52.679
You promising to be faithful
is a lie nobody'd believe.

06:52.762 --> 06:55.345
They'd believe it more
than you saying you'd obey.

06:55.428 --> 06:56.845
Obeying is for dogs.

06:56.929 --> 06:58.553
That's why you getting
divorced now.

06:58.637 --> 07:02.095
I'm not divorced.
I'm separated.

07:04.011 --> 07:07.220
Oh, uh, I'll be back.
You all right?

07:07.303 --> 07:10.178
Yeah, I'm fine.
You okay?

07:10.261 --> 07:12.053
You want me to go with you?

07:12.136 --> 07:14.178
Nah, I'ma go by myself.

07:14.261 --> 07:15.929
Text me when you get there.

07:26.303 --> 07:29.553
through your hardships

07:29.637 --> 07:32.804
there's no guarantees

07:32.887 --> 07:36.053
break a promise

07:36.136 --> 07:39.220
down that aisle

07:42.637 --> 07:45.553
I will be your defense

07:45.637 --> 07:48.136
till it all ends

08:02.011 --> 08:04.512
This is
a private service.

08:04.595 --> 08:05.970
I'm here
to pay my respects.

08:06.053 --> 08:07.095
You can keep them.

08:08.011 --> 08:09.261
Excuse me.

08:13.261 --> 08:15.512
Hey, little man.

08:17.679 --> 08:19.637
You can vouch for me,
can't you?

08:23.637 --> 08:24.804
Nah.

09:23.512 --> 09:27.679
How many of you mothers
out there have lost a child?

09:31.637 --> 09:34.095
How many of you
have had to bury two?

09:36.595 --> 09:40.095
It's like we part of some club
nobody wants to belong to.

09:45.053 --> 09:46.845
Listen.

09:46.929 --> 09:49.428
Last time
I was in this church,

09:49.512 --> 09:51.387
Brandon got up here
and told the truth.

09:53.720 --> 09:56.929
I remember being mad as hell
at his ass for doing it.

09:59.178 --> 10:01.136
But now I realize
why he did it.

10:06.428 --> 10:09.679
He did it
because at some point,

10:09.762 --> 10:11.804
we all get tired of lying.

10:15.136 --> 10:18.929
At some point,
it's just easier to...

10:20.804 --> 10:23.762
...stop caring
what everybody thinks

10:23.845 --> 10:25.929
and just speak.

10:31.053 --> 10:33.387
Look...

10:33.470 --> 10:34.970
I didn't wanna have no kids.

10:36.595 --> 10:39.095
I knew I wasn't cut out
to be somebody's mother.

10:41.345 --> 10:43.136
And that's 'cause
nobody mothered me.

10:45.345 --> 10:48.637
Nobody ever loved me
unconditionally.

10:52.845 --> 10:56.011
So I spent most of my youth
a broken girl.

10:59.679 --> 11:01.553
I got some bright idea that

11:01.637 --> 11:04.095
having kids
would make me whole.

11:08.053 --> 11:09.512
But I was wrong.

11:12.136 --> 11:13.595
After Brandon was born,

11:13.679 --> 11:16.595
I realized I had
nothing to give him.

11:19.887 --> 11:23.178
So...I gave him my trauma.

11:25.387 --> 11:27.261
I gave him my pain.

11:27.345 --> 11:31.220
I gave him all the things that
I didn't know what to do with.

11:34.929 --> 11:36.470
And you know
what he did with it?

11:38.553 --> 11:41.136
He made it something beautiful.

11:44.553 --> 11:47.261
He used my pain

11:47.345 --> 11:49.470
as fuel for his dreams.

11:54.637 --> 11:58.804
He tried to escape all
the bad things in his life.

11:58.887 --> 12:02.095
He tried to run away from them.

12:07.136 --> 12:09.220
But he could never outrun me.

12:10.929 --> 12:13.220
He couldn't save his brother.

12:13.303 --> 12:14.679
He couldn't love Jerrika

12:14.762 --> 12:16.595
the way she deserved
to be loved,

12:16.679 --> 12:19.345
because he was born
out of brokenness.

12:21.345 --> 12:23.512
He never had a damn shot.

12:23.595 --> 12:25.053
Neither did Coogie.

12:26.637 --> 12:29.512
I had no right to bring
them boys into this world.

12:32.095 --> 12:33.804
And I never should've
raised them in a city

12:33.887 --> 12:35.428
that would rather see
their likeness

12:35.512 --> 12:36.720
painted up on a brick wall

12:36.804 --> 12:40.178
than to see them
graduate from college.

12:50.053 --> 12:51.136
But you know what?

12:53.178 --> 12:55.887
I'm glad I was the vessel

12:55.970 --> 12:58.261
that was chosen to bring them
into this world.

13:01.428 --> 13:03.970
I'm glad they existed
in this world

13:04.053 --> 13:07.136
for the very short time
that they did.

13:10.637 --> 13:12.887
Because they finally taught me

13:12.970 --> 13:16.720
what it was like to be loved

13:16.804 --> 13:19.095
with no conditions.

13:32.512 --> 13:33.845
Well...

13:36.512 --> 13:38.845
I don't have
nothing left to lose.

13:40.804 --> 13:43.345
And I damn sure
don't have shit to give.

13:44.887 --> 13:47.136
They were all I had,

13:47.220 --> 13:49.762
and this city took 'em from me.

13:57.261 --> 13:58.303
So...

14:00.637 --> 14:03.011
...I'm always gonna be broken.

14:06.679 --> 14:08.679
And there ain't nothing

14:08.762 --> 14:12.303
that's ever gonna
make me whole again.

14:31.929 --> 14:34.136
I'm so glad you got
those track scholarships.

14:34.220 --> 14:35.637
Uh-huh,
'cause them student loans

14:35.720 --> 14:36.970
ain't nothing to play with.

14:37.053 --> 14:38.512
Yeah, I'm still gonna have
some loans to pay back.

14:38.595 --> 14:40.095
I'm just glad
you're going to college.

14:40.178 --> 14:41.470
For a while,
you was acting so fast,

14:41.553 --> 14:42.595
we thought you was
gonna get pregnant

14:42.679 --> 14:43.970
before you finished
high school.

14:44.053 --> 14:45.303
I am not fast.

14:45.387 --> 14:47.261
We heard about that
older man you was messing with.

14:47.345 --> 14:48.428
Mm-hmm.

14:48.512 --> 14:50.095
You was about to get
trapped in the closet.

14:50.178 --> 14:51.470
That ain't true.

14:51.553 --> 14:54.178
So how do the lesbians
do the last names?

14:54.261 --> 14:55.679
What?

14:55.762 --> 14:57.470
Well, does the girly one take
the butch-y one's last name?

14:57.553 --> 14:58.845
Don't say "butch-y."

14:58.929 --> 15:01.845
Say "masculine presenting"
or "soft-stud."

15:01.929 --> 15:03.095
Well, I hear
some gay couples

15:03.178 --> 15:05.679
combine the last names
and make a whole new last name.

15:05.762 --> 15:07.011
Now, that's
some Illuminati shit.

15:07.095 --> 15:08.053
Bye, y'all.

15:25.011 --> 15:27.387
how life changes

15:32.303 --> 15:37.470
and the next, you're down

15:39.428 --> 15:41.887
and a-spinning

15:41.970 --> 15:46.553
and a-wishing it stops

15:46.637 --> 15:49.804
to get off the ground...

15:49.887 --> 15:52.095
Nigga, have you lost
your damn mind?

15:52.720 --> 15:54.887
I'm just here
to express my condolences.

15:54.970 --> 15:56.220
You got a lot of nerve
bringing your rusty ass

15:56.303 --> 15:57.679
up to the Lord's front door.

15:57.762 --> 16:00.011
Go home.

16:00.095 --> 16:03.970
and distant...

16:04.053 --> 16:05.887
Hey, Miss Johnson.

16:05.970 --> 16:07.595
Hi.

16:09.679 --> 16:12.261
Your son and I, we were
getting to know each other.

16:12.345 --> 16:15.095
He was very talented
and he had a lot of potential.

16:15.178 --> 16:17.887
This breaks my heart.

16:17.970 --> 16:20.136
It really does.

16:20.220 --> 16:21.804
What's your name?

16:21.887 --> 16:23.595
Otis Perry.

16:23.679 --> 16:24.929
Hmm.

16:25.011 --> 16:26.637
My son never
mentioned you to me.

16:26.720 --> 16:28.053
Yeah, well, look, I, um...

16:28.136 --> 16:30.261
I just came to, uh,

16:30.345 --> 16:31.929
offer my condolences,

16:32.011 --> 16:35.929
and if you ever need anything,

16:36.011 --> 16:38.220
just give me a call.

16:40.178 --> 16:41.470
I don't need shit from you.

16:43.595 --> 16:44.720
What that slimy nigga want?

16:44.804 --> 16:46.303
I don't know. Just get me
the fuck outta here.

16:58.261 --> 17:00.720
don't know up from down...

17:00.804 --> 17:02.136
Uh, Miss-Miss Johnson.

17:02.220 --> 17:03.970
You can keep your thoughts
and prayers too,

17:04.053 --> 17:05.136
'cause they can't
do shit for me.

17:05.220 --> 17:07.011
No, I just wanted to say--
No.

17:07.095 --> 17:09.929
I just wanted to say your son
meant a lot to me.

17:10.011 --> 17:12.345
He meant a lot to this city.

17:12.428 --> 17:14.762
for your voice...

17:14.845 --> 17:16.553
I just wanted to say
I'm sorry.

17:16.637 --> 17:18.637
Hmm. So what you gonna do?

17:18.720 --> 17:20.887
Well, I'm gonna try
to keep his business alive.

17:20.970 --> 17:22.387
I think that's what
he would've wanted.

17:24.053 --> 17:25.303
Shit.

17:25.387 --> 17:27.970
If I was you,
I'd get the fuck outta Dodge.

17:29.095 --> 17:31.929
Chicago don't love you.

17:32.011 --> 17:34.470
This city don't love
no damn body.

17:40.679 --> 17:43.387
That's him?

17:43.470 --> 17:44.720
That's that nigga.

17:44.804 --> 17:47.220
He got custody
of my little brother Jake.

17:50.345 --> 17:53.929
He don't look like shit.

17:54.011 --> 17:55.762
That's 'cause he ain't.

18:02.553 --> 18:05.512
-

18:22.929 --> 18:24.178
I see why Brandon
used to get into it

18:24.261 --> 18:25.970
with his mom all the time.

18:26.053 --> 18:27.929
She's grieving, man.
Leave her alone.

18:28.011 --> 18:29.553
She ain't have to come
at me like that, though.

18:29.637 --> 18:30.929
I'm grieving too.

18:31.011 --> 18:32.470
I'm pretty sure she's
grieving way more than you.

18:32.553 --> 18:33.387
Eh, fuck her.

18:42.553 --> 18:44.679
Kev.

18:44.762 --> 18:47.303
Kev, you good?

18:51.178 --> 18:53.345
Yeah.

18:53.428 --> 18:56.303
It's gonna be all right.
I got you now.

18:58.011 --> 19:00.011
You're not Brandon.

19:00.095 --> 19:00.970
Nigga, you think
I don't know that?

19:01.053 --> 19:04.345
Don't say "nigga."
Brandon hated that word.

19:06.261 --> 19:09.011
Look, I know I can't
take his place.

19:10.804 --> 19:12.011
But that ain't gonna stop me

19:12.095 --> 19:14.095
from having your back
like chiroprac.

19:18.345 --> 19:20.345
We're gonna get through this.

19:20.428 --> 19:22.679
All right?

19:22.762 --> 19:24.970
Yeah.

19:27.095 --> 19:28.762
All right, come on,
I think they finna play

19:28.845 --> 19:30.428
the "Cha-Cha Slide."

19:30.512 --> 19:33.595
-

19:47.011 --> 19:48.512
I love lesbians.

19:48.595 --> 19:49.970
Yo, shut up.

19:53.303 --> 19:54.428
Ohh!

19:58.845 --> 20:00.887
Ooh!
Not today, Satan.

20:00.970 --> 20:02.470
It's on now.

20:02.553 --> 20:03.887
Papa, your daddy
would kill you

20:03.970 --> 20:05.637
if he saw you out here
acting like a fool.

20:05.720 --> 20:06.804
He don't know what to do
with that anyway.

20:06.887 --> 20:08.929
And neither do you.

20:09.011 --> 20:10.345
Shit, I ain't a kid
no more.

20:10.428 --> 20:11.553
Yeah, you is.

20:11.637 --> 20:13.553
You better ask about me.

20:13.637 --> 20:15.804
Boy, bye.

20:26.261 --> 20:28.136
How long you been
standing there?

20:28.220 --> 20:30.512
Long enough to see
you need some help.

20:30.595 --> 20:32.595
Oh, enjoy the wedding.
I got this.

20:34.011 --> 20:36.387
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, for sure.

20:38.595 --> 20:40.345
Why you working today anyway?

20:41.804 --> 20:43.845
It's the Chi.
People die every day, Ma.

20:45.553 --> 20:50.095
Emmett, you don't have
to act strong for me.

20:52.261 --> 20:53.762
Can you hand me them tongs
over there?

21:00.261 --> 21:01.553
Thank you.

21:03.387 --> 21:05.845
Heard you and Darnell
came to the wedding together.

21:05.929 --> 21:06.970
Who told you that?

21:07.053 --> 21:09.470
It don't matter.

21:09.553 --> 21:11.887
He gave me a ride,
that's it.

21:11.970 --> 21:14.387
Uh, yeah, I know that move.

21:14.470 --> 21:15.720
That's how it starts.

21:15.804 --> 21:18.261
Boy, shut up.

21:19.428 --> 21:20.804
First thing, y'all going
to weddings together.

21:20.887 --> 21:21.929
The next thing y'all know,

21:22.011 --> 21:23.470
y'all butt naked
on the waterbed, pshh!

21:23.553 --> 21:26.136
Please, last time
I was on that damn waterbed,

21:26.220 --> 21:27.220
I got pregnant with you.

21:27.303 --> 21:29.053
Then stay away from it, then.

21:29.136 --> 21:31.679
Who you think
you talking to?

21:33.261 --> 21:35.970
All I'm saying is, just call me
when you need a ride,

21:36.053 --> 21:38.428
and I can go borrow Tiff's car
and come scoop you.

21:39.720 --> 21:41.720
Okay.

21:41.804 --> 21:43.136
Smile, girl.

21:43.220 --> 21:44.679
Don't tell girls
to smile.

21:44.762 --> 21:45.804
Stop being fast.

21:45.887 --> 21:47.512
Will y'all just let
the girl live? Damn!

21:47.595 --> 21:49.095
Y'all gonna have to scooch in
closer than that.

21:49.178 --> 21:50.387
Act like you like each other.

21:50.470 --> 21:51.595
Can y'all hurry up?
Damn.

21:51.679 --> 21:52.929
Say "damn" again,
you gonna get a whuppin'

21:53.011 --> 21:54.261
and be on punishment.

21:54.345 --> 21:55.845
- I don't care.
- Boy, what you say?

21:55.929 --> 21:57.428
Nothing.

21:57.512 --> 22:00.136
-

22:06.762 --> 22:08.679
Whoever made
this mac and cheese

22:08.762 --> 22:10.011
needs their throat slit.

22:10.095 --> 22:12.136
Heh, a white person
must've made this chicken,

22:12.220 --> 22:14.428
'cause it ain't got
a ounce of seasoning on it.

22:14.512 --> 22:16.178
I can't stand Dre.

22:16.261 --> 22:18.011
Why do you care?
You're gonna be gone next year.

22:18.095 --> 22:20.095
I don't even think Ma
like her that much.

22:20.178 --> 22:21.428
Our walls are very thin

22:21.512 --> 22:23.220
and my room's
right next to theirs.

22:23.303 --> 22:25.220
They be liking each other
a whole lot.

22:25.303 --> 22:26.679
They be liking each other
all the time.

22:26.762 --> 22:27.720
Okay.

22:27.804 --> 22:28.887
It's time
for the first dance.

22:32.637 --> 22:33.804
There it go.
There it go.

22:33.887 --> 22:35.929
Ay, ay.

22:36.011 --> 22:38.220
Ay. Come on, girl.

22:38.303 --> 22:39.470
Come on, let's show 'em
what we got.

22:39.553 --> 22:42.261
- Hey.
- Whoo!

22:42.345 --> 22:44.970
I don't want, yeah

22:54.011 --> 22:55.303
- Come on.
- Hey.

22:59.929 --> 23:01.929
Yeah, there it is.

23:05.595 --> 23:08.261
- May I?
- No, you may not.

23:08.345 --> 23:11.762
Come on, woman,
we can dance at the wedding.

23:11.845 --> 23:13.387
No.

23:13.470 --> 23:15.011
Suit yourself.

23:15.095 --> 23:16.053
I'm sure I'll find
somebody out here

23:16.136 --> 23:17.345
wants to dance with me.

23:17.428 --> 23:18.970
Yeah, I think I saw
some desperate women

23:19.053 --> 23:21.178
hovering by the potato salad.

23:21.261 --> 23:24.136
Mm, mm, mm.

23:30.095 --> 23:33.178
I don't want, yeah...

23:33.261 --> 23:35.804
Ss, this some expensive shit.

23:37.261 --> 23:38.804
What you about to do
with that?

23:38.887 --> 23:40.178
I'm gonna drink it.

23:40.261 --> 23:42.261
Wine ain't nothing but
the blood of Jesus anyway.

23:44.845 --> 23:45.887
What's up, Eboni?

23:45.970 --> 23:47.845
Hey, Kevin.

23:51.303 --> 23:52.470
Why you wasting wine?

23:55.053 --> 23:56.595
It's for my brother.

24:04.929 --> 24:06.970
That's for Brandon.

24:10.804 --> 24:12.804
Let's get fucked up.

24:16.470 --> 24:18.303
What's wrong?

24:18.387 --> 24:19.929
Why something
gotta be wrong?

24:22.178 --> 24:24.220
You don't like Dre, do you?

24:25.261 --> 24:26.804
She does get on my nerves.

24:29.303 --> 24:31.470
That's not it, though.

24:33.011 --> 24:35.220
- Yo, you pregnant?
- No, fool.

24:35.303 --> 24:37.428
Ooh, thank God.

24:37.512 --> 24:40.095
If I was,
it wouldn't be yours.

24:40.178 --> 24:41.470
Shit, you never know.

24:41.553 --> 24:43.679
If I stare at a girl too long,
she get pregnant.

24:45.970 --> 24:47.595
Stop staring at me, then.

24:52.136 --> 24:53.345
No, I'm just...

24:53.428 --> 24:55.887
I'm nervous
about leaving next year.

24:55.970 --> 24:56.762
Really?

24:56.845 --> 24:58.095
Thought you'd be ready
to get the hell

24:58.178 --> 25:00.512
outta your mama's house.

25:00.595 --> 25:03.679
I'm just not excited
about leaving home, you know?

25:03.762 --> 25:06.261
Being around a bunch
of white people I don't know.

25:07.303 --> 25:09.261
And I don't love track
that much.

25:09.345 --> 25:12.011
I don't know, these sound
like bougie problems to me.

25:12.095 --> 25:13.595
I'm serious.

25:15.136 --> 25:16.303
I wanna stay here.

25:16.387 --> 25:18.136
And do what?

25:18.220 --> 25:19.762
Fuck a bunch
of wack-ass dudes

25:19.845 --> 25:22.637
and wind up getting pregnant
by one of these motherfuckers?

25:22.720 --> 25:25.387
End up working at CVS
the rest of your life?

25:27.220 --> 25:28.637
What's wrong with that?

25:30.387 --> 25:33.595
Look, who cares
if you don't like track?

25:33.679 --> 25:36.220
Use that shit
to get up outta here.

25:38.845 --> 25:40.220
Come on.

25:42.887 --> 25:44.428
And look,
don't be afraid to leave

25:44.512 --> 25:45.970
'cause you just too scared
to see what's out there.

25:46.053 --> 25:49.428
- I'm not scared.
- Uh, yes, you are.

25:49.512 --> 25:51.470
And that's cool.

25:51.553 --> 25:53.637
You're supposed
to be scared sometimes.

25:56.762 --> 25:58.762
Are you scared?

26:00.762 --> 26:03.345
Brandon's gone.

26:03.428 --> 26:06.011
There's always a slight chance
I got a kid on the way.

26:08.512 --> 26:10.595
It's my job
to look after Kevin now.

26:13.136 --> 26:15.345
And I think my parents
are fucking again.

26:19.595 --> 26:21.387
I'm scared as fuck.

26:26.720 --> 26:29.720
-

27:09.720 --> 27:11.762
The fuck?

27:15.720 --> 27:17.720
-

27:22.178 --> 27:23.970
you left me, girl

27:27.136 --> 27:28.887
Yes, work, bitch.

27:30.053 --> 27:31.261
Jada.

27:31.345 --> 27:32.595
- Come on, boy, I see you.
-

27:32.679 --> 27:35.220
I see.
Jada, come on, come on.

27:35.303 --> 27:36.470
Uh-uh, no, Dre,
stop playing.

27:36.553 --> 27:37.929
Now, you knew good
and goddamn well

27:38.011 --> 27:39.929
your black ass was gonna have
to dance at my wedding.

27:40.011 --> 27:42.303
I don't know why
you wore them shoes, girl.

27:42.387 --> 27:44.220
Come on.
-

27:44.303 --> 27:46.053
- Hey. Oh, let me get that.
- But--

27:46.136 --> 27:47.428
Let me get that
from you, bro.

27:50.679 --> 27:52.679
threw my love away

27:52.762 --> 27:54.095
left it stranded...

27:54.178 --> 27:55.345
Oh.

27:55.428 --> 27:57.303
Sisters are like fine wine,

27:57.387 --> 27:59.553
and you the finest
of 'em all.

27:59.637 --> 28:03.303
A woman really doesn't know
what she want until she's 45.

28:03.387 --> 28:05.261
Uh, well, I'm 39.

28:05.345 --> 28:06.970
Shit, that'll work.

28:08.970 --> 28:11.637
Oh, wait.
Who the hell ordered pizza?

28:11.720 --> 28:13.553
- I did.
- Why?

28:13.637 --> 28:14.970
'Cause the food
is a struggle.

28:15.053 --> 28:16.804
I can't have people
going home hungry.

28:16.887 --> 28:18.428
Well, let me whip up
a fresh batch of mac and cheese

28:18.512 --> 28:20.178
and I can season more chicken.

28:20.261 --> 28:21.679
Look, I know you're
going through a lot.

28:21.762 --> 28:24.553
Don't worry about it.

28:24.637 --> 28:27.053
No, no, no, I wanna earn
the money you're giving me.

28:27.136 --> 28:28.470
You have earned it.

28:28.553 --> 28:31.178
Most people wouldn't even
have showed up today.

28:32.303 --> 28:34.637
I applaud your dedication.

28:34.720 --> 28:37.512
Hold your head up.
You'll figure it out.

28:37.595 --> 28:39.970
Here, it's half
of what I owe you.

28:40.053 --> 28:43.053
I'll give you
the other half tomorrow.

28:47.136 --> 28:48.762
Now, go home and get some rest.

28:48.845 --> 28:50.970
A friend of Dre
is a friend of mine.

28:51.053 --> 28:52.178
You're family now.

28:52.261 --> 28:55.136
I'll always be here
if you need anything.

28:55.220 --> 28:56.637
Thank you.

28:56.720 --> 28:59.553
Thank you for being there
for my son.

29:06.303 --> 29:09.136
you'd never leave me...

29:09.220 --> 29:11.679
Shit.

29:11.762 --> 29:13.679
Y'all should come through.
I got the house.

29:13.762 --> 29:14.970
For real?

29:15.053 --> 29:17.804

Okay, I'm down.

29:22.512 --> 29:24.679

I'll bring the weed.

29:24.762 --> 29:27.053
Really, y'all in here

29:27.136 --> 29:29.929

- My bad.

29:30.011 --> 29:31.595
And y'all got the nerve to be
drinking the expensive shit.

29:31.679 --> 29:33.804
Relax.

29:33.887 --> 29:35.762
Is Papa okay?

29:35.845 --> 29:38.136
You know church boys
can't handle their liquor.

29:39.428 --> 29:42.387
Hey, everything

29:42.470 --> 29:44.011

31:19.929 --> 31:21.470
Check it out, y'all.

31:21.553 --> 31:23.470
How low can you go?

31:23.553 --> 31:24.970
Can you go down low?

31:25.053 --> 31:27.470
All the way to the floor.

31:27.553 --> 31:29.011
How low can you go?

31:29.095 --> 31:31.345
Can you bring it to the top?

31:31.428 --> 31:33.553
Like you never, never stop?

31:33.637 --> 31:36.011
Can you bring it to the top?

31:53.512 --> 31:54.970
To what do I owe the pleasure?

31:55.053 --> 31:57.095
What you talking about?

31:58.303 --> 32:00.845
You wanted to see me,
and I'm here.

32:00.929 --> 32:02.637
Wait, you ain't
call the meeting?

32:04.345 --> 32:05.303
Shit.

32:25.762 --> 32:29.387
Since this nigga
was still breathing,

32:29.470 --> 32:30.929
I'm just gonna assume
that you ain't know shit

32:31.011 --> 32:32.637
about them killing Reg.

32:35.595 --> 32:37.679
I had my suspicions,

32:37.762 --> 32:40.220
but something this sensitive,

32:40.303 --> 32:42.887
I needed to be 100% sure.

32:44.804 --> 32:46.929
How you ain't sure

32:47.011 --> 32:49.136
and I figured all of this
shit out way in Kankakee?

32:52.637 --> 32:54.679
Don't look at him.
He gone.

32:57.679 --> 32:59.929
I want my little brother back.

33:02.762 --> 33:05.679
When was the last time
you even seen Jake?

33:05.762 --> 33:08.345
You got locked up
in, what, 2013?

33:09.512 --> 33:11.929
Boy ain't seen you
since he was eight.

33:12.011 --> 33:13.470
He wouldn't be able
to pick your ass up

33:13.553 --> 33:15.220
out of a lineup.

33:17.679 --> 33:20.220
Excuse the pun.

33:20.303 --> 33:22.178
Nigga, Reg was supposed
to take care of him.

33:22.261 --> 33:24.512
Yeah, well, Reg never
made that shit official.

33:28.011 --> 33:29.929
So your mother...

33:30.011 --> 33:32.595
surrendered custody to me.

33:32.679 --> 33:34.136
Of course she did.

33:36.303 --> 33:37.804
Okay.

33:37.887 --> 33:40.220
So how much
is my little bro worth?

33:41.470 --> 33:44.553
A whole lot.

33:44.637 --> 33:46.470
Don't worry,
she did the right thing.

33:46.553 --> 33:49.553
No, the right thing
would've been to call me.

33:49.637 --> 33:53.470
Oh, I offered, but, um...

33:55.679 --> 33:58.178
...Jake said you were dead.

34:06.053 --> 34:07.345
Well...

34:10.970 --> 34:13.345
I guess this is
the resurrection.

34:28.470 --> 34:30.261
Boom, that's for you.

34:30.345 --> 34:31.512
For what?

34:31.595 --> 34:33.553
For being the woman
of the house while we're gone.

34:33.637 --> 34:35.512
She don't get money
to watch her little brother.

34:35.595 --> 34:37.929
Hey, she's 18.
She's doing us a favor.

34:38.011 --> 34:40.178
- A favor?
- We talked about this.

34:40.261 --> 34:41.845
We gotta be a united front.

34:41.929 --> 34:43.512
This ain't much.

34:43.595 --> 34:45.595
Don't look a gift horse
in the mouth.

34:45.679 --> 34:47.845
And this
is for Emmett.

34:47.929 --> 34:50.095
I just need you to give him
the money and that's all,

34:50.178 --> 34:51.303
you hear me?

34:51.387 --> 34:53.136
Ma, please, he live
with his baby mama.

34:53.220 --> 34:54.220
Ain't nobody
thinking 'bout him.

34:54.303 --> 34:55.679
Mm-hmm.

34:56.470 --> 34:57.637
playing

34:59.261 --> 35:00.929
when she want it

35:03.261 --> 35:07.720
is the peace sign

35:07.804 --> 35:10.845
record it and rewind"

35:21.470 --> 35:24.595
and shout out loud...

35:24.679 --> 35:26.804
So you're not gonna
ask me how my day was?

35:26.887 --> 35:29.220
How was your day, my king?

35:29.970 --> 35:31.970
Ss, don't play with me, Tiff.

35:35.637 --> 35:38.679
First of all, Brandon's mama
is crazy as hell.

35:38.762 --> 35:40.178
I been knew that.

35:40.261 --> 35:42.512
She went up there
raving and ranting

35:42.595 --> 35:44.387
about how she always
been fucked up

35:44.470 --> 35:46.762
and that's basically
why Brandon was fucked up,

35:46.845 --> 35:49.345
even though he spent his
whole life trying not to be.

35:49.428 --> 35:51.178
Wow.

35:51.261 --> 35:52.887
And then when I tried to say
I was sorry for her loss,

35:52.970 --> 35:55.053
she-she was like,

35:55.136 --> 35:56.637
"You need to get the fuck
outta Dodge.

35:56.720 --> 35:58.387
This city don't love you."

35:58.470 --> 36:00.387
Yeah, where's the lie in that?
Here.

36:00.470 --> 36:02.011
Really?

36:04.845 --> 36:06.303
I'm sorry.

36:08.345 --> 36:10.929
Are you okay?

36:11.011 --> 36:14.220
I'm good.
I'm good.

36:20.053 --> 36:21.470
No, you not.

36:21.553 --> 36:22.887
How you gonna tell me
how I feel?

36:22.970 --> 36:24.720
Because I know you.

36:28.387 --> 36:30.428
Did my mom tell you
them niggas ordered pizza?

36:30.512 --> 36:32.804
She did.

36:32.887 --> 36:35.887
I saw people eating pizza
on Nina's Insta Story.

36:36.887 --> 36:38.637
That shit's fucked up.

36:38.720 --> 36:41.553
Shit, I would've ordered pizza,
too, if the food wasn't right.

36:41.637 --> 36:43.553
I'm only one person.
What they expect?

36:43.637 --> 36:45.595
They expect to get
some good food.

36:45.679 --> 36:48.345
Don't nobody care about what
you're going through, Emmett.

36:53.387 --> 36:55.220
Shit, now I want some pizza.

36:55.303 --> 36:56.845
Are you serious?

36:56.929 --> 36:58.887
I wonder if they still open.

36:58.970 --> 37:00.887
Tiff, this not funny.

37:03.011 --> 37:04.762
This shit gotta work.

37:07.095 --> 37:10.220
I gotta do this shit
for Brandon.

37:10.303 --> 37:13.053
Shit, I gotta do it for us.

37:13.136 --> 37:16.011
If you're gonna do it,
do it for you.

37:16.095 --> 37:17.720
Otherwise,
it ain't gonna work.

37:19.512 --> 37:22.345
"Pillow Talk" playing

37:26.136 --> 37:30.053
something

37:49.387 --> 37:52.637

37:55.428 --> 37:57.595

37:57.679 --> 38:02.720

38:05.303 --> 38:10.053

38:10.136 --> 38:12.887
- Oh, shit.

38:12.970 --> 38:15.428
your pillow...

38:15.512 --> 38:16.595
Yeah, that's it.

38:16.679 --> 38:18.220
That's it right there.
Oh!

38:21.887 --> 38:23.011
Come on in.

38:25.553 --> 38:27.929
Yeah, just set it over there
by the bed, man.

38:30.261 --> 38:32.136
Cool, cool.
Appreciate you.

38:34.679 --> 38:35.428
Wow.

38:35.512 --> 38:37.553
- Yes.

38:37.637 --> 38:38.929
Thank you.

38:42.720 --> 38:44.095
Wow, I can't
believe this nigga

38:44.178 --> 38:45.512
is really running for mayor.

38:45.595 --> 38:47.845
Anything's gonna be better
than what we got.

38:47.929 --> 38:49.929
Hmm.

38:50.845 --> 38:52.595
but I ain't worried

38:52.679 --> 38:55.095
I'ma try and hurry

38:56.637 --> 38:58.053
I see you, Kiesha.

38:58.136 --> 39:00.929
Ugh, that's disgusting.
Who you going to see?

39:01.011 --> 39:03.512
Don't worry about it.
If Ma calls, where am I?

39:03.595 --> 39:04.970
- Hangin' with Tammy.
- And what are we doing?

39:05.053 --> 39:06.303
- Studying for the SATs.
- Perfect.

39:06.387 --> 39:07.887
Look, this house
better not smell like weed

39:08.011 --> 39:09.095
when I get back.

39:09.178 --> 39:11.011
Yo, relax. I got, like,
four bottles of Be Breezy.

39:11.095 --> 39:12.845
Boy, that shit don't work.

39:19.512 --> 39:21.136

39:24.220 --> 39:25.470

39:25.553 --> 39:28.053

39:41.720 --> 39:43.136
So we all gonna be in pajamas.

but I'm just waiting...

40:14.428 --> 40:16.428

40:18.011 --> 40:19.845
What up, Kiesha?

40:19.929 --> 40:21.428

40:21.512 --> 40:23.679
You ain't gotta stand outside.
Come on.

40:23.762 --> 40:25.053
You sure?

40:25.136 --> 40:27.387
Girl, ain't nobody

40:38.261 --> 40:40.387
- Appreciate it.
- Mm-hmm.

40:40.470 --> 40:42.720
Look, don't forget

Yeah, I'm gonna stop

40:47.220 --> 40:49.095
Y'all ever heard of Venmo?

40:49.178 --> 40:51.428
Oh, girl, my stepmom

40:52.303 --> 40:55.053
Look, I don't mind you coming
here to drop my money off.

40:55.136 --> 40:57.178
Just don't come to my house
looking like no hooker.

40:58.095 --> 41:00.929
Look, I don't want no parts
of your situation, okay?

41:01.011 --> 41:02.762
I'm dressed up for my man,

41:02.845 --> 41:04.220

41:06.095 --> 41:07.387
Why you always gotta trip?

41:07.470 --> 41:09.136
You see we handling business.

41:09.220 --> 41:10.804
What's wrong with you?

41:13.512 --> 41:15.929
Yo, Kiesha,

41:16.011 --> 41:17.929
Uh, yeah, I think
I'm going to Pepperdine.

41:18.011 --> 41:19.887
Damn, where that at?

41:19.970 --> 41:21.136
California.

41:21.220 --> 41:23.345
Ah, shit.
Can I come visit?

41:23.428 --> 41:24.345
Hell no!

41:24.428 --> 41:26.136
- Aw, you cold-blooded.
-

41:26.220 --> 41:27.387
Boy, take your ass
back in the house.

41:27.470 --> 41:28.637
You know I'm always
gonna love you, right?

41:28.720 --> 41:30.387
Stop being messy, Emmett.

41:30.470 --> 41:31.720
Nah, nah, nah, nah.
I really--

41:31.804 --> 41:33.261
For real, I don't
mean it like that.

41:33.345 --> 41:35.303
I just mean like you always

41:35.387 --> 41:37.970
got a place in my heart,
for real.

41:52.136 --> 41:54.178
This could work.

42:02.553 --> 42:04.387
Yeah, I'm glad
we took this place.

42:04.470 --> 42:06.720
I can put my barber stuff
over here by the sink.

42:11.637 --> 42:14.303
I guess I can run the
card games out the back room.

42:14.387 --> 42:16.053
And if we're
working out of here,

42:16.136 --> 42:17.679
the rent'll pay for itself.

42:19.929 --> 42:22.720
I already got money
saved up for a lawyer.

42:22.804 --> 42:24.679
You know I don't fuck
with no lawyers.

42:24.762 --> 42:29.220
Look, if we're gonna do this,
we gotta do this the right way.

42:29.303 --> 42:30.261
You got lawyer money?

42:30.345 --> 42:32.303
I got you.

42:37.428 --> 42:39.762
Where would I be without you?

42:39.845 --> 42:42.095
Lost and ashy.

42:47.345 --> 42:48.720
When did you get out?

42:51.887 --> 42:53.345
Hi, I'm Imani.

42:53.428 --> 42:55.762
Thanks for agreeing
to meet us here.

42:57.470 --> 42:59.178
So how much you sell
your son for?

43:02.845 --> 43:05.762
Just give me the number.
I'll go get him back.

43:09.929 --> 43:10.929
Five thousand.

43:14.178 --> 43:16.261
I'll give you ten.

43:16.345 --> 43:18.178
But you gotta go down to
the courthouse tomorrow morning

43:18.261 --> 43:20.595
and tell 'em you're clean
and you want your son back.

43:22.470 --> 43:24.553
I don't know if I can.

43:24.637 --> 43:26.762
You know,
you still ain't shit.

43:28.011 --> 43:30.637
If I could erase you
out my mind, I would.

43:30.720 --> 43:32.011
I knew I should've
taken Jake with me.

43:32.095 --> 43:33.512
Then why didn't you?

43:33.595 --> 43:35.428
Because I ain't
his fucking mama. You are.

43:35.512 --> 43:37.887
I did the best I could
with y'all.

43:37.970 --> 43:40.261
Ain't none of your daddies
worth shit.

43:40.345 --> 43:42.345
I ain't have no help.

43:42.428 --> 43:45.845
So yeah, if that
rich motherfucker

43:45.929 --> 43:47.970
wanna take him
and give him a good life,

43:48.053 --> 43:49.553
I'm gonna let him.

43:49.637 --> 43:51.053
Look, I'm not trying
to get in y'all business--

43:51.136 --> 43:51.804
Then don't.

43:55.053 --> 43:56.470
Give us a minute.

44:05.762 --> 44:08.595
You know, I never knew what
it felt like to feel wanted.

44:11.303 --> 44:13.512
Neither did Reg.

44:14.512 --> 44:16.178
That's why we so fucked up.

44:18.595 --> 44:20.595
I don't want that for Jake.

44:20.679 --> 44:21.970
He deserves better.

44:24.178 --> 44:26.637
Look, you-you ain't never
gave me shit in this life.

44:28.637 --> 44:31.970
This is...this is
all I want from you.

44:34.178 --> 44:36.595
I didn't know
you wanted him that bad.

44:39.720 --> 44:41.595
Well, now you know.

44:52.970 --> 44:55.470
Fine.

44:55.553 --> 44:57.804
I'll go down to the courthouse.

45:21.512 --> 45:22.804
Thank you.

45:27.303 --> 45:30.553
-

45:30.637 --> 45:32.970
All right, y'all,
act natural.

45:46.595 --> 45:47.762
Hey.

45:49.595 --> 45:51.303
Maisha?

45:51.387 --> 45:52.845
Don't be startled.

45:52.929 --> 45:55.387
You tried to be slick
and got caught.

45:55.470 --> 45:56.845
Ain't nobody was tryin'
to be slick.

45:56.929 --> 45:58.845
Mm-hmm, whatever.

45:58.929 --> 46:01.845
Me and Eboni, we go back
like babies and pacifiers.

46:01.929 --> 46:05.261
Oh, uh, I didn't know that.

46:05.345 --> 46:07.011
Well, now you know.

46:09.303 --> 46:10.261
Hey, Papa.

46:17.470 --> 46:19.136
Yo, Kev, I can't lie.

46:19.220 --> 46:21.387
The summer's been good
to Maisha.

46:21.470 --> 46:23.553
I'm not mad.

46:23.637 --> 46:26.720
Would it be weird
if I spent some, you know,

46:26.804 --> 46:28.428
quality time with her?

46:28.512 --> 46:30.595
What you mean,
quality time?

46:30.679 --> 46:32.470
Don't act like you don't know
what that means.

46:32.553 --> 46:33.970
Look, how you even know

46:34.053 --> 46:35.679
she wanna spend
quality time with you?

46:35.762 --> 46:37.470
You saw how she looked
at me, Kev.

46:37.553 --> 46:39.887
- You saw it.
- I saw that shit too, bro.

46:39.970 --> 46:41.887
It ain't up to me who
she spend quality time with.

46:41.970 --> 46:43.595
It's up to Maisha.

46:43.679 --> 46:44.970
-  You right.

46:46.095 --> 46:47.387
You right.

46:47.470 --> 46:50.345
Just...treat her right.

46:50.428 --> 46:51.637
She ain't just
some regular girl.

46:51.720 --> 46:53.345
She special.

46:53.428 --> 46:55.303
I know.

46:55.387 --> 46:56.929
Make your move.

46:57.011 --> 46:58.679
What should I say?

46:58.762 --> 47:00.220
Just compliment
her hair and shit.

47:00.303 --> 47:03.011
Don't objectify her.
She smart.

47:03.095 --> 47:06.512
You gotta connect with her
on some intellectual-type shit.

47:06.595 --> 47:08.929
I can do that.

47:09.011 --> 47:10.553
There's three of us
and three of them.

47:10.637 --> 47:11.470
Let's divide and conquer.

47:11.553 --> 47:13.303
All right,
I'll take my room,

47:13.387 --> 47:15.637
Jake takes Kiesha's,
and you take my mom's.

47:15.720 --> 47:17.970
No, fuck that.

47:18.053 --> 47:19.220
I don't know what's in there.

47:19.303 --> 47:21.428
There's probably all types
of whips and chains

47:21.512 --> 47:22.762
and essential oils.

47:22.845 --> 47:24.637
They probably be using that
Victoria's Secret body spray

47:24.720 --> 47:25.970
- on each other and shit.
- Yo, shut up.

47:26.053 --> 47:27.178
I don't know
what your mama's into.

47:27.261 --> 47:28.637
Papa, you don't get a choice.

47:28.720 --> 47:29.970
You get the old folks' room.

47:30.053 --> 47:31.595
My mom's not that old.

47:31.679 --> 47:34.303
Fine, I'll take this one
for the team.

47:34.387 --> 47:36.637
Just go in there
and burn some incense

47:36.720 --> 47:38.303
and play some Erykah Badu
and see what happens.

47:38.387 --> 47:40.970
I'm tryin' to set a mood,
not have a séance.

47:45.136 --> 47:46.095
No, no.

47:49.220 --> 47:50.720
Yo, I don't care what
nobody say about you, Ronnie.

47:50.804 --> 47:53.011
You a'ight with me, bro.

47:53.095 --> 47:54.887
What they sayin'?

47:54.970 --> 47:56.845
Man, you know.

47:56.929 --> 47:58.720
What they sayin' about me?

47:58.804 --> 48:01.136
You know how niggas
in these streets talk, man.

48:01.220 --> 48:03.178
Folks always gonna have
something to say.

48:03.261 --> 48:05.637
At some point,
folks need to move on,

48:05.720 --> 48:07.637
let me live my life.

48:07.720 --> 48:09.637
You took a life, man.

48:09.720 --> 48:12.011
Some people ain't gonna never
let you live that shit down.

48:12.095 --> 48:14.011
It's gonna follow you around
the rest of your life

48:14.095 --> 48:15.679
whether you like it or not.

48:15.762 --> 48:18.887
But you can't be worried about
what people think about you.

48:18.970 --> 48:20.804
You just gotta do more good
in the world, man.

48:20.887 --> 48:23.220
You just need to balance
that shit out, bro.

48:24.595 --> 48:25.804
Y'all need anything else?

48:25.887 --> 48:27.512
Yeah, let me get
another E&J.

48:27.595 --> 48:28.970
Put it on my tab.

48:29.053 --> 48:30.679
Why don't you slow down
with that shit, man?

48:30.762 --> 48:32.053
What, you my daddy now?

48:32.136 --> 48:34.595
Just saying, bro, you need
to leave that shit alone.

48:34.679 --> 48:36.637
Yeah, that brown liquor
ain't good for your body, bro.

48:36.720 --> 48:38.553
Yeah, fuck y'all.

48:38.637 --> 48:40.595
You want the drink or not?

48:43.136 --> 48:46.220
Nah, I'm good.

48:48.345 --> 48:49.720
But you know what?

48:51.387 --> 48:52.595
I'm gonna get outta here.

48:52.679 --> 48:54.220
Don't get mad, man.

48:54.303 --> 48:55.512
We're just looking out
for you, Joe.

48:55.595 --> 48:56.887
I'm not mad.

48:56.970 --> 48:59.303
Appreciate y'all holding me
accountable and shit.

48:59.387 --> 49:00.845
- Yeah?

49:00.929 --> 49:03.595
You be careful
getting home, bro.

49:05.136 --> 49:08.303
baby

49:17.970 --> 49:21.136
oh, yeah

49:24.470 --> 49:27.220
baby

49:30.303 --> 49:32.095
just said you liked me...

49:32.178 --> 49:34.929
- Bye, Big Papa.
- Bye, Queen.

49:36.845 --> 49:39.637
what I'm supposed to do

49:39.720 --> 49:42.512
was to get close to you

49:42.595 --> 49:44.595
What the hell was that?

49:44.679 --> 49:46.762
A gentleman never tells.

49:46.845 --> 49:48.679
Next time,
I want the lesbian room.

49:48.762 --> 49:50.512
Yeah, what y'all did?

49:50.595 --> 49:52.261
Well, I gave her
a foot massage,

49:52.345 --> 49:54.929
and we talked about her plans
to build a community center

49:55.011 --> 49:56.929
for kids that come
from low-income households.

49:57.011 --> 49:58.804
That does not sound sexy
at all.

49:58.887 --> 50:01.053
She bared her soul to me,
y'all.

50:01.136 --> 50:03.220
That's way more important
than baring her body.

50:03.303 --> 50:05.011
I ain't tryin' to see
nobody's soul.

50:05.095 --> 50:07.095
- I want both.
- You gotta put in work, Kev.

50:07.178 --> 50:08.470
How much work?

50:08.553 --> 50:10.679
Well, that depends on the girl.

50:10.762 --> 50:11.929
You gotta earn her trust.

50:12.011 --> 50:13.679
You gotta bare
your soul to her.

50:13.762 --> 50:15.762
This ain't all "wham, bam,
thank you, ma'am" stuff.

50:15.845 --> 50:17.387
You gotta take things slow.

50:17.470 --> 50:18.804
Where are you
getting this from?

50:18.887 --> 50:20.261
I been reading
DeVon Franklin's book.

50:20.345 --> 50:22.637
It's all about saving
yourself for marriage

50:22.720 --> 50:24.595
and asking God
to send you your equal.

50:24.679 --> 50:25.887
Bro, that sounds
like homework.

50:25.970 --> 50:27.136
Did y'all connect
with your ladies

50:27.220 --> 50:28.387
on an intellectual level?

50:29.804 --> 50:31.929
- I mean...
- Yeah?

50:32.011 --> 50:34.762
We kissed
and I fingered her.

50:34.845 --> 50:36.303
I smashed.

50:36.387 --> 50:37.845
I hope you don't
regret that soul tie.

50:37.929 --> 50:39.845
What?

50:39.929 --> 50:41.887
Oh, yeah, every time
you're intimate with someone,

50:41.970 --> 50:43.637
you're forever connected.

50:43.720 --> 50:45.970
You take on all their stress
and all their trauma.

50:46.053 --> 50:48.053
It's attached
to your soul forever.

50:48.136 --> 50:49.970
- No, it's not.
- I hope she ain't crazy.

50:50.053 --> 50:51.136
Am I soul tied?

50:51.220 --> 50:53.261
Mm, I gotta do some research,

50:53.345 --> 50:55.261
but as soon as I get
some clarity,

50:55.345 --> 50:56.845
I'll circle back.

51:11.720 --> 51:13.845
Excuse me.
I'm sorry.

51:13.929 --> 51:15.011
You're good, sweetheart.

51:15.095 --> 51:16.178
-

51:18.428 --> 51:20.178
Bag.

51:20.261 --> 51:23.011
You must not know
who this money belong to.

51:28.095 --> 51:30.178
-

51:33.762 --> 51:36.220
-

52:49.887 --> 52:52.095
waiting

52:58.011 --> 53:00.261
my body set up

53:00.345 --> 53:02.804
of you

53:06.261 --> 53:08.095
waiting

53:08.178 --> 53:11.303
so come through
