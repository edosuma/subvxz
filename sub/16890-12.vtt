on the outskirts of town.

Two more water parks,
and we're in Durnsville.

00:18.143 --> 00:19.437
Thanks for coming with me,
Titus.

00:19.520 --> 00:21.564
I owe you one.

Look, I know you don't
want to be here,

00:23.691 --> 00:25.610
but you're the only one
who can stop the Reverend.

00:25.693 --> 00:27.570

You can't be back here.

03:00.180 --> 03:02.182
- Why is that?
- Isn't there a back door?

03:02.266 --> 03:03.768
Well, there used to be,

03:03.851 --> 03:05.269
but all the prisoners
kept escaping through it,

03:05.352 --> 03:06.395
so we got rid of it.

03:06.478 --> 03:07.772
But without a door there,

03:07.855 --> 03:09.148
they escaped even quicker.

about the environment?

Why are you dressed like that?

03:23.829 --> 03:24.956
And who are these women?

03:25.039 --> 03:27.541
Did you actually find new people
to join the Reverend's church?

03:27.625 --> 03:29.418
And this is only
the beginning.

03:29.501 --> 03:33.005
I got all these women

07:35.414 --> 07:38.042
that when I saved you

07:38.125 --> 07:40.878
you were running away from home,

founder, Zachary Ville.

07:45.216 --> 07:47.426
I wasn't running
from Durnsville.

07:47.509 --> 07:49.428
I had just gotten into a fight
with my mom

07:49.511 --> 07:51.722

07:51.805 --> 07:53.473
she wanted to wear
to my recital.

07:53.557 --> 07:55.809
I was running away from her.

07:55.893 --> 07:57.936
And there I was,
minding my own business,

07:58.020 --> 08:00.856

outside the Tastee Freez.

08:00.939 --> 08:03.150

08:03.234 --> 08:05.194
Ladies and gentlemen

08:05.277 --> 08:07.612
Kimmy Schmidt wasn't
just running away

08:07.696 --> 08:09.073
from our beloved town.

08:09.156 --> 08:11.783
She was heading east...

08:11.867 --> 08:13.369
to Ohio.

08:13.452 --> 08:15.120
Ohio's stupid.

08:15.204 --> 08:18.957
Now, I might just be
a simple country preacher,

08:19.041 --> 08:22.586
but it seems to me
that if fewer people

08:22.669 --> 08:24.463
"ran away" from Durnsville,

08:24.546 --> 08:27.883
maybe Elston Buckner's
tractor dealership

08:27.966 --> 08:29.634
wouldn't have had to close
last year,

08:29.718 --> 08:33.889
and maybe the firehouse could
have finally gotten a pole

08:33.972 --> 08:36.934
so Durnsville's finest
wouldn't have to freefall

08:37.017 --> 08:38.643
20 feet onto a concrete floor.

08:40.145 --> 08:42.356
Now, I'm not saying
that Kimmy Schmidt

08:42.440 --> 08:45.401
is solely responsible
for all our town's troubles.

08:45.484 --> 08:47.486
Objection!
Overruled!

08:47.569 --> 08:50.406
But if she had stayed
in Durnsville,

08:50.489 --> 08:53.033
like a real American,

08:53.117 --> 08:54.993
I know for a fact

08:55.077 --> 08:57.079

09:04.711 --> 09:06.130
Let's take a quick recess.

09:15.514 --> 09:18.517
You mess with the big dog...

09:18.600 --> 09:20.936
and you get the horns.

09:21.019 --> 09:22.354
[whistles]

09:27.318 --> 09:29.403
Oh, thank you.

09:31.363 --> 09:32.739
[spitting]

09:32.823 --> 09:35.534
What kind of country-ass
sugar water is this?

09:35.617 --> 09:38.078
Well, well...

09:38.162 --> 09:39.288
Word of advice, brother.

09:39.371 --> 09:41.081
Sir, we are cousins at most.

09:41.165 --> 09:42.500
I know this seems great now.

09:42.582 --> 09:44.543
Free birthday-cake-flavored
water,

09:44.626 --> 09:46.128
everyone paying you attention.

09:46.211 --> 09:47.463
And it lasts forever.

09:47.546 --> 09:48.588
No, sir.

09:48.672 --> 09:49.798
After my viral video,

09:49.881 --> 09:51.133
I got a taste of fame.

09:51.216 --> 09:52.634
I got to meet Truckasaurus.

09:52.717 --> 09:54.136
I got to wave
the checkered flag

09:54.219 --> 09:55.429
at an execution.

09:55.513 --> 09:57.389
But there is a darker side
to fame.

09:57.473 --> 09:58.516
I don't think so.

09:58.598 --> 10:01.393
And I've seen the first half of
every Behind the Music ever.

10:01.477 --> 10:03.061
I'm just saying,
thanks to my "fame,"

10:03.145 --> 10:04.688
the IRS started calling.

10:04.771 --> 10:07.399
The Navy realized
I hadn't been eaten by a whale.

10:07.483 --> 10:08.900
And my dentist tracked me down.

10:08.984 --> 10:10.610
I was way overdue
for a cleaning,

10:10.694 --> 10:12.530
and those hurt!

10:12.612 --> 10:14.698
And they're all, "There's ham
in your dry socket, sir."

10:14.781 --> 10:18.035
Nah, man,
they didn't say that.

10:18.118 --> 10:20.078
My point is...

10:20.162 --> 10:22.289
[singing flatly]
♪ The other shoe is gonna drop ♪

10:22.373 --> 10:25.042
♪ You wait and see ♪

10:25.125 --> 10:26.377

It's me.

10:29.004 --> 10:31.215
♪ Yeah, it's me ♪

10:36.220 --> 10:37.262
So tell me, Kimmy,

10:37.346 --> 10:38.930
if it was so bad in the bunker,

10:39.014 --> 10:40.224
why didn't you just leave?

10:40.307 --> 10:41.725
As I said before,

10:41.808 --> 10:42.934
you never let us.

10:43.018 --> 10:44.061
Oh, really?

10:44.144 --> 10:45.354
Because I recall a conversation

10:45.437 --> 10:48.315
I had with my client--
where was that?

10:49.107 --> 10:50.526
Where's he going with this?

10:52.277 --> 10:53.320
"IDK."

10:53.404 --> 10:54.446
What does that mean?

10:54.530 --> 10:55.614
Is that a black thing?

10:57.449 --> 10:59.159
Yes, here it is.

10:59.243 --> 11:00.702
You just said, under oath,

11:00.785 --> 11:02.287
that my client never gave
any of you

11:02.371 --> 11:03.747
the opportunity
to leave the bunker.

11:03.830 --> 11:05.499
Uh, doy!

11:05.583 --> 11:07.459
Doy indeed, Ms. Schmidt.

11:07.543 --> 11:09.461
Your honor,
if it pleases the court,

11:09.545 --> 11:11.338
I would like everyone
to close their eyes

11:11.422 --> 11:13.382
and join me in a flashback.

11:14.716 --> 11:15.675
All right.

11:18.887 --> 11:19.888
[sighs]

11:23.392 --> 11:24.851
Ooh, my goodness.

11:24.935 --> 11:26.270
That's 24 hours on the crank.

11:26.353 --> 11:27.521
That's what she said!

11:27.605 --> 11:29.064
That's what he said,

11:29.147 --> 11:31.691
because she
shouldn't be talking.

11:31.775 --> 11:32.901
Haven't you learned
your lesson yet?

11:32.984 --> 11:34.319
There's no world out there.

11:34.403 --> 11:35.946
Yes, there is.

11:36.029 --> 11:38.616
That rat I found
in the air filter proves it.

11:38.698 --> 11:40.659
That rat was a Devil's trick,

11:40.742 --> 11:42.661
just like when the Devil
made it sound

11:42.744 --> 11:44.538
like I was arguing
with a pizza guy

11:44.622 --> 11:46.582
about what a half hour means.

11:46.665 --> 11:47.707
You're a liar.

11:47.791 --> 11:49.126
And your pony tail's stupid.

11:49.209 --> 11:51.044
My pony tail is cool.

11:51.128 --> 11:52.754
God said so.

11:52.837 --> 11:54.798
And I'm getting a little
sick and tired of you, Kimmy.

11:54.881 --> 11:56.091
I ought to throw you
out that door

11:56.174 --> 11:57.717
and into that lake of fire,

11:57.801 --> 12:00.095
let the Devil
and all his Freddys Krueger

12:00.178 --> 12:01.639
play baseball with your head.

12:01.721 --> 12:03.223
Fine, do it.

12:03.307 --> 12:04.349
I don't care.

12:04.433 --> 12:05.559
Oh, you don't care?

12:05.643 --> 12:06.851
You think you know
better than me?

12:06.935 --> 12:09.396
Even though God
bought me this watch.

12:11.982 --> 12:14.276
So... if you're so sure
of yourself,

12:14.359 --> 12:15.694
I guess you wouldn't object

12:15.777 --> 12:19.448
if I sent Sister Cyndee
out into the wasteland.

12:21.992 --> 12:23.160
What?

12:25.787 --> 12:27.914
Yeah.

12:27.998 --> 12:31.376
We'll send Cyndee
out into the apocalypse.

12:31.460 --> 12:32.836
And if you're right,

12:32.919 --> 12:34.963
we'll have a big laugh
at my expense,

12:35.046 --> 12:37.341
and by way of apology
I will take you all

12:37.424 --> 12:39.551
to the water park
of your choice.

12:39.635 --> 12:41.052
But if you're wrong...

12:43.263 --> 12:44.806
she'll burn up and die.

12:46.099 --> 12:47.309
What's the matter?

12:47.392 --> 12:49.227
I thought you had this
all figured out.

12:49.311 --> 12:51.104
Sister Cyndee,
could you join us

12:51.188 --> 12:52.523
in the grand ball tube?

12:52.606 --> 12:53.898
[Cyndee] Be there in a jiff!

12:53.982 --> 12:55.359
She trusts you.

12:55.442 --> 12:57.027
She counts on you
to take care of her,

12:57.110 --> 12:59.697
especially since you cured
her Hulkamania.

13:01.615 --> 13:04.326
So...

13:04.409 --> 13:07.037
as long as you're
absolutely sure...

13:27.432 --> 13:28.642
What?

13:31.853 --> 13:33.480
What?

13:33.564 --> 13:35.733
[Cyndee]
You could have let me go?

13:36.858 --> 13:38.610
[raspy] Eat your vitamins
and say your prayers,

13:38.694 --> 13:39.819
Kimmy Schmidt!

13:39.903 --> 13:41.739
Dang it, my Hulkamania's back!

13:41.821 --> 13:44.324
[raspy]
And it's a bad one, brotha!

13:47.202 --> 13:48.704
Ladies and gentlemen
of the jury,

13:48.787 --> 13:51.456
clearly my client offered
to let these women go.

13:51.540 --> 13:53.333
Kimmy Schmidt chose to stay.

13:53.417 --> 13:55.001
Now, if that's kidnapping,

13:55.085 --> 13:57.128
lock me up
and throw away the key.

13:57.212 --> 13:58.505
Objection!

13:58.589 --> 14:00.298
There are no keys
at the jail anymore.

14:00.382 --> 14:01.883
It is a card
with a chip in it,

14:01.966 --> 14:03.719
like at a Hampton Inn.

14:07.639 --> 14:09.140
Remember our trip
to Pittsburgh, hon?

14:09.224 --> 14:10.308
With the free USA Today?

14:10.392 --> 14:11.435
You go straight for the red.

14:11.518 --> 14:12.644
I go right for the purple.

14:12.728 --> 14:14.979
We are a classic
USA Today couple.

14:15.063 --> 14:16.732
[laughs]

14:16.815 --> 14:17.899
[sighs]

14:21.653 --> 14:22.696
Stop the presses.

14:22.780 --> 14:23.863
My paninis can wait.

14:23.947 --> 14:24.989
I'm talking to Kimmy Schmidt,

14:25.073 --> 14:26.283
the shame of Durnsville.

14:26.366 --> 14:28.326
Me?
But Ed Hardy was born here.

14:29.035 --> 14:31.747
Kimmy, I did not raise you
to embarrass me like that.

14:31.830 --> 14:33.290
You didn't raise me.

14:33.373 --> 14:35.125
That's what I just said.

14:35.208 --> 14:36.460
Golly, Kimmy.

14:36.543 --> 14:37.753
I was really counting on you

14:37.836 --> 14:39.797
to help get me back
on the force.

14:39.879 --> 14:43.049
"Local cop's hero step-daughter
saves the day,"

14:43.133 --> 14:44.718
that'd get
the chief's attention.

14:44.802 --> 14:46.177
Now all I got is,

14:46.261 --> 14:49.473
"Suspended cop
rescued from bouncy house."

14:51.516 --> 14:53.393
Nice work, jagweed.

14:55.604 --> 14:56.938
I depended on you.

14:57.021 --> 14:58.857
You were supposed
to be the strong one.

14:58.940 --> 15:00.776
I know, and I was
so mad at myself.

15:00.859 --> 15:04.070
We could have gotten out
of that bunker seven years ago.

15:04.154 --> 15:07.240
I could have gotten to Brandon
before he decided to be gay.

15:07.324 --> 15:08.659
You don't decide to be gay.

15:08.742 --> 15:10.327
I know.

15:10.410 --> 15:12.162
You watch Magic Mike
during a lightning storm

15:12.245 --> 15:13.413
like Brandon did.

15:13.497 --> 15:15.749
Either way,
I could have stopped it.

15:15.833 --> 15:18.585
You're not my
maid of honor anymore.

15:18.669 --> 15:21.087
I don't know who you are.

15:24.215 --> 15:25.300
[sighs]

15:28.052 --> 15:29.346
Where were you?

15:29.429 --> 15:31.014
I was at the courthouse
the whole time.

15:31.097 --> 15:32.599
Good job?

15:32.683 --> 15:34.893
Did you go on a radio show
while I was testifying?

15:34.976 --> 15:37.354
I had to, Kimmy, for you.

15:37.437 --> 15:40.231
Johnny and The Squatch from Z101
wanted to interview you.

15:40.315 --> 15:42.651
I took that bullet, literally.

15:42.734 --> 15:44.653
Why am I holding
this trashcan lid?

15:44.736 --> 15:46.112
[gunshot zings]

15:46.196 --> 15:48.072
Why is this real?
We on the radio!

15:48.156 --> 15:50.283
[The Squatch]
You got Squatched!

15:50.367 --> 15:52.661
I got Squatched for you--
Squatched!

15:52.744 --> 15:54.830
Please, you love
the attention.

15:54.913 --> 15:56.623
"I'm your friend, Kimmy Wimmy.

15:56.707 --> 15:58.500
I'm here to support you."

15:58.583 --> 16:00.335
Hey, how would you like it
if I went,

16:00.418 --> 16:02.754
"Dar-dar-dar-dar, uh,
nar-nar-nar...

16:02.838 --> 16:04.088
Uh, nar."

16:04.172 --> 16:06.257
Ugh, forget it, Titus!

16:06.341 --> 16:07.843
Do whatever you want.

16:07.926 --> 16:09.553
I'll still be the worst person
in Durnsville.

16:09.636 --> 16:10.804
You have not met The Squatch.

16:10.888 --> 16:11.930
I blew it.

16:12.013 --> 16:13.849
Everyone hates me, even Cyndee.

16:13.932 --> 16:15.475
Especially Cyndee!

16:15.559 --> 16:17.561
The Reverend's gonna go free.

16:17.644 --> 16:19.563
And your comforter
smells terrible.

16:19.646 --> 16:21.398
It's my cologne, Dutch Oven.

16:21.481 --> 16:23.066
But that's not important.

16:25.068 --> 16:26.778
Kimmy, you can't give up.

16:26.862 --> 16:28.988
You are tee-nay-shee-us.

16:29.072 --> 16:30.407
You got those folks
in our neighborhood

16:30.490 --> 16:31.950
to stop shooting guns
at the moon.

16:32.033 --> 16:33.076
Yeah, but this is different.

16:33.159 --> 16:34.578
I can't fix everything here

16:34.661 --> 16:36.538
by telling people
the moon is Puerto Rican.

16:36.621 --> 16:38.498
Stop it, you are
the dictionary definition

16:38.582 --> 16:39.917
of "stick-to-it-ivity."

16:39.999 --> 16:41.042
Aretha!

16:41.125 --> 16:42.252
The dictionary!

16:42.335 --> 16:44.212
Titus, you're a genius.

16:44.295 --> 16:45.923
So we're staying?

16:46.005 --> 16:49.259
I can do that interview for you
on WTHR's 11:00 news?

16:49.342 --> 16:50.719
That's Indianapolis, Kimmy,

16:50.802 --> 16:53.471
the 25th biggest media market
in America.

16:53.555 --> 16:55.933
19th if you count deers looking
through people's windows.

16:56.015 --> 16:57.100
You go get on TV.

16:57.183 --> 16:58.560
I'm gonna save the day.

16:58.643 --> 17:00.270
And then I'm gonna talk
to the front desk

17:00.353 --> 17:02.146
about getting a room
with a roof.

17:11.072 --> 17:13.032
Yes!
I got two!

17:13.116 --> 17:15.285
And it went in the other lane,
so it counts as double.

17:15.368 --> 17:18.037
[in Spanish] This is why you
haven't made any new friends.

17:18.121 --> 17:20.081
Cyndee.
Cyndee Pokorny!

17:20.164 --> 17:21.583
What are you doing here,
Kimmy?

17:21.666 --> 17:23.418
Trying to ruin
my bachelorette party

17:23.501 --> 17:24.920
like you ruin everything?

17:26.964 --> 17:28.506
Look, I know I messed up,

17:28.590 --> 17:30.133
and I can't undo what I did.

17:30.216 --> 17:33.011
But we have to make sure
the Reverend goes to jail.

17:33.094 --> 17:36.180
And that means we have
to get the evidence ourselves.

17:36.264 --> 17:37.307
I have a plan.

17:37.390 --> 17:38.516
Great, go do it.

17:38.600 --> 17:40.310
My friends and I

17:40.393 --> 17:42.395
have a penis-shaped
ice cream cake to get to.

17:42.479 --> 17:43.521
[gasps]

17:43.605 --> 17:44.940
Ice cream?

17:45.023 --> 17:46.441
Do you know what part of the cow
that comes from?

17:46.524 --> 17:47.943
Cyndee, I know you thought

17:48.026 --> 17:49.402
I was the strong one,

17:49.486 --> 17:51.905
but I was only strong
when I was with you.

17:51.989 --> 17:53.531
That time the Reverend
tricked me,

17:53.615 --> 17:55.408
it's because I was alone.

17:55.492 --> 17:56.994
I need your help,

17:57.076 --> 17:58.161
'cause what we have
to do right now

17:58.244 --> 17:59.329
is gonna be really hard.

17:59.412 --> 18:00.747
What are you talking about?

18:00.831 --> 18:02.624
We're going back
to the bunker.

18:02.707 --> 18:03.750
Bunker?

18:03.834 --> 18:06.003
The bunker?
Yay, wonderful.

18:06.085 --> 18:08.296
Kimmy, this is
my bachelorette party.

18:08.379 --> 18:10.548
