WEBVTT

00:02.419 --> 00:05.013
I'm running to the bar
to watch the games with the guys.

00:05.188 --> 00:07.179
- Oh, no, no, no.
- Why?

00:07.357 --> 00:09.086
- Why?
- Where did that shirt come from?

00:09.259 --> 00:10.954
I don't know. Found it in the back.

00:11.127 --> 00:14.961
- I figured I haven't worn it in a while...
- It needs to go way back, further.

00:15.131 --> 00:17.429
- Why would I change? Yeah.
- Why would you change?

00:17.600 --> 00:19.568
- Why would you wear that?
- I don't know.

00:19.736 --> 00:22.204
Mommy, Daddy,
look what I found in the toilet.

00:22.572 --> 00:25.700
- Where did you get that, sweetheart?
- I made it.

00:25.875 --> 00:27.206
- You made that?
- You made it?

00:27.377 --> 00:28.435
Yes, you did.

00:28.611 --> 00:29.839
Don't squeeze it.

00:30.013 --> 00:32.914
- That was shit. She has shit in her hand.
- Mm-hm.

00:33.083 --> 00:34.345
Why is she picking up shit?

00:34.517 --> 00:37.111
I've read about this before.
It's like fun with feces.

00:37.287 --> 00:38.618
Fun with feces?

00:38.788 --> 00:41.621
I've taken dumps before.
It's fun, you take a picture of it.

00:41.791 --> 00:43.258
- Send it to friends.
- Disgusting.

00:43.426 --> 00:45.656
You don't whip it around your head
like a churro.

00:45.829 --> 00:48.889
- Just let her grow out of it.
- You're the mother, deal with this.

00:49.065 --> 00:51.727
- Don't tell anybody.
- I'm not gonna tell anyone.

00:51.901 --> 00:54.369
- Nobody knows about this poop situation.
- Obviously.

00:54.537 --> 00:56.061
I'm putting it in the kitchen.

00:56.239 --> 00:58.264
- Okay, honey...
- No, no, no, baby, don't.

01:02.545 --> 01:04.739
To two of my good friends.

01:04.914 --> 01:08.179
Mr. Frank Gore and Mr. Andre Johnson.

01:08.351 --> 01:11.320
Leading the Double Ent-Andres to victory.

01:11.488 --> 01:13.615
This is my worst nightmare.
Losing to you.

01:13.790 --> 01:16.384
I was expecting
a little bit of a challenge this week.

01:16.559 --> 01:18.424
- But your team is so terrible.
- Oh, stop.

01:18.595 --> 01:21.758
This is like <i>Freaky Friday.</i>
Like, Kevin has gone into Andre's body.

01:21.931 --> 01:23.330
The roles have reversed.

01:23.500 --> 01:25.968
Guess what.
I'm your mother, but I'm cool now.

01:26.136 --> 01:29.469
- What do you mean?
- You reversed roles and he's crushing you.

01:29.639 --> 01:31.766
I'm Jamie Lee Curtis,
you're Lindsay Lohan.

01:31.941 --> 01:33.101
I'm cool, you're not.

01:33.276 --> 01:34.937
- This is what I lost to?
- Wow.

01:35.111 --> 01:38.205
You know, I do talk a lot of smack, guys,
but it's only because I can:

01:39.682 --> 01:41.172
- What does that mean?
- Back it up.

01:41.351 --> 01:43.285
I can back up my smack talk, my friend.

01:44.888 --> 01:46.719
Okay, really? Stereo?

01:46.890 --> 01:49.450
When the guy's right, he's right.
Knows what he's doing.

01:49.626 --> 01:51.958
Hi, I got off the phone
with the out-of-towners.

01:52.128 --> 01:54.824
Vince would like me
to give you the number for a shelter...

01:54.998 --> 01:56.488
...because Andre beat your ass so bad.

01:56.666 --> 01:58.725
- That's nice.
- All this can be fixed.

01:58.902 --> 02:00.301
All you have to do is win.

02:00.470 --> 02:03.337
I will win, okay, but there's
something strange going on here.

02:03.506 --> 02:07.169
Can I just say, next week,
I would like to extend an invitation to you...

02:07.343 --> 02:11.575
...to watch the games at my house
and have a meal provided by my lovely wife.

02:11.748 --> 02:15.912
I have not been invited over since the arrival
of The First Human Child. Have you been?

02:16.085 --> 02:18.883
- I don't know if I have security clearance.
- I don't.

02:19.055 --> 02:21.523
- Do you?
- No, I haven't been through the scanners.

02:21.691 --> 02:24.057
We got a dog.
Ellie can play with the dog.

02:24.227 --> 02:25.558
- You've got a dog?
- Come over.

02:25.728 --> 02:28.720
Enjoy my home, watch the games.
It will be lovely.

02:28.898 --> 02:30.923
- That'd be exciting.
- Yeah, Sofia's excited.

02:31.100 --> 02:34.126
She's gonna be cooking some famous dish.
That should be good.

02:34.304 --> 02:36.169
Oh, Sofia's gonna be there.

02:36.339 --> 02:39.172
- Yeah, my wife's gonna be at my house.
- Oh, cool.

02:39.342 --> 02:40.741
I haven't seen her in a while.

02:42.011 --> 02:43.410
She's fun, she's cool.

02:43.580 --> 02:45.411
- You want us to bring anything?
- Yeah.

02:45.582 --> 02:47.641
You know what you can bring
is a condom...

02:47.817 --> 02:51.412
...so that you can just go to town on Kevin
like you did last week.

02:52.922 --> 02:55.015
- Backing it up.
- It's all right, buddy.

02:59.863 --> 03:02.263
- How's your lineup looking?
- <i>It's not good.</i>

03:02.632 --> 03:04.429
LT is listed as questionable.

03:04.601 --> 03:07.468
Questionable, what does that mean?
No one knows what that means.

03:07.637 --> 03:09.764
It's like if I start him,
and he doesn't play...

03:09.939 --> 03:12.271
...I have nothing in the bank,
got no backups.

03:12.442 --> 03:14.273
- <i>I'm screwed.</i>
- Yeah, you have no outs.

03:14.444 --> 03:16.002
They know if they're playing.

03:16.179 --> 03:17.646
They know. They should tell us.

03:17.814 --> 03:20.112
We should have a direct phone line
to these guys.

03:20.283 --> 03:23.446
Not to mention,
I'm playing Andre this week.

03:23.620 --> 03:25.884
<i>And rumor is,</i>
<i>he actually beat someone last week.</i>

03:26.055 --> 03:28.285
<i>I mean, can you imagine</i>
<i>losing to that guy?</i>

03:28.458 --> 03:30.426
Are you happy now? Are you finished?

03:30.593 --> 03:32.788
You've really...
You've done enough to my psyche.

03:32.962 --> 03:34.725
It could happen to anyone, all right?

03:34.898 --> 03:36.092
Gotta go. All right, bye.

03:36.266 --> 03:37.824
Hey, you.

03:38.268 --> 03:40.600
- What are you doing here?
- What are you doing here?

03:40.770 --> 03:43.000
I had a couple meetings. I'm in between.

03:43.172 --> 03:45.072
- Great to see you.
- Let's go grab a drink.

03:45.241 --> 03:46.833
I, um...

03:47.010 --> 03:51.003
You know what, I can't
because I have to do a house-call thing.

03:51.180 --> 03:52.841
- You're a plastic surgeon.
- Yeah.

03:53.016 --> 03:56.713
Do you have, like, an emergency spider vein,
or a tit popped or something like that?

03:56.886 --> 03:58.114
- What happened?
- Good one.

03:58.288 --> 04:00.222
I'd love to hang out,
but I gotta do this.

04:00.390 --> 04:04.053
Kidding aside, I gotta say something.
Uh, we break your balls about the league...

04:04.227 --> 04:07.196
...but you're really doing well
and I'm happy for you.

04:07.363 --> 04:11.129
Well, guess what. I've always been
this good. I've always been a champion.

04:11.301 --> 04:15.397
And you know what I've been doing is
I've been sowing and now I'm reaping.

04:15.571 --> 04:18.836
Planting the seed and then
I've grown into a beautiful flower...

04:19.007 --> 04:22.273
...and now everyone wants to smell me.
So smell it?

04:23.613 --> 04:24.602
- You smell that?
- What?

04:24.781 --> 04:26.681
- It's bullshit, man.
- Oh, really?

04:26.849 --> 04:30.808
You're out there. I see you. You're out
there. You got your games you're playing.

04:30.987 --> 04:33.888
You got people on the side
you're paying to help you out.

04:34.057 --> 04:36.582
There's maybe even a dungeon.
You got a guy down there.

04:36.759 --> 04:39.592
- All right, I'm onto you.
- You know what I smell?

04:39.963 --> 04:42.454
Ah, yes, it's, uh, the smell of jealousy...

04:42.632 --> 04:44.361
...with a tinge of admiration...

04:44.534 --> 04:50.166
...and just a whiff of sadness.
Good luck because I'm gonna:

04:51.541 --> 04:53.736
- Oh, here we go. Back it up.
- Back it up.

04:55.000 --> 05:01.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:02.318 --> 05:04.309
- What's up, Dre?
- Oh, what's up, ballers?

05:04.487 --> 05:06.318
Dre. What's up, man?

05:06.489 --> 05:07.615
- High-five.
- There he is.

05:07.790 --> 05:09.485
- Oh, yeah, buddy.
- All right.

05:09.926 --> 05:12.156
Dr. Dre, you are killing it.

05:12.328 --> 05:13.795
You are dominating this league.

05:13.963 --> 05:15.624
Tell me something I don't know.

05:15.798 --> 05:19.029
Andre Potter and the Fantasy Zone
is coming for you.

05:19.435 --> 05:21.995
All right, so watch out.
This week I'm up against you.

05:22.171 --> 05:25.140
- I know you're gonna beat me.
- I dominate the waiver wire.

05:25.308 --> 05:28.072
- Andre, I thought maybe this week...
- Whoa. What'd you call me?

05:28.678 --> 05:30.771
- l... Andre.
- No, no, no.

05:30.947 --> 05:33.609
Here I'm Dre, okay?

05:33.783 --> 05:36.809
- I'm sorry. Heh. I'm so sorry.
- All right? Hey, it's cool.

05:36.986 --> 05:38.510
- You accept my apology?
- Accepted.

05:38.688 --> 05:41.987
We were thinking of going to Hammer's
house in Wrigleyville, just hanging.

05:42.158 --> 05:44.718
- Watching all the games...
- No, guys. No Sundays.

05:44.894 --> 05:47.158
- We'll do the weekend afterwards.
- No Sundays.

05:47.330 --> 05:50.731
How many times do I have to tell you?
Wanna talk on Sundays, don't call me.

05:50.900 --> 05:52.561
- Text me.
- We'll take it.

05:52.735 --> 05:54.293
- There you go.
- Yeah, we're good.

05:54.470 --> 05:58.531
Let's all agree that we are The League
of Extraordinary Fantasy Gentlemen.

05:58.708 --> 06:01.939
No, no, instead of The League
of Extraordinary Fantasy Gentlemen...

06:02.111 --> 06:06.445
...I think that we should change it to The
Fantasy League of Extraordinary Gentlemen.

06:06.616 --> 06:08.516
- Oh, triple snap.
- Right?

06:08.684 --> 06:09.446
- Boom, boom, boom!
- Boom, boom, boom!

06:11.370 --> 06:13.531
All right, LT. How's the ankle, bud?

06:13.839 --> 06:15.272
Questionable. Questionable.

06:15.441 --> 06:17.068
What does that tell me? All right.

06:17.243 --> 06:20.269
You wanna play it that way?
All right, that's fine.

06:22.514 --> 06:25.608
Hi, this is Pete. I'd like to speak
with Terry Bradshaw, please.

06:26.051 --> 06:29.043
Yeah, it's a personal matter
so just returning his call.

06:29.221 --> 06:30.586
Hey, is Bradshaw around?

06:30.756 --> 06:31.780
Yeah, Pete needs him.

06:31.957 --> 06:34.255
Hi, I have Peter calling for Mr. Bradshaw.

06:34.426 --> 06:37.054
Pete. P-E-T-E, for Terry.

06:37.229 --> 06:39.697
Yeah, it's Uncle Pete.
Let me talk to Terry.

06:40.099 --> 06:42.192
<i>Hey, Pete, it's Terry.</i>

06:43.235 --> 06:44.463
Hi, Terry.

06:44.637 --> 06:46.571
Hey, Uncle Pete, is everything all right?

06:46.739 --> 06:47.763
<i>Is there a problem?</i>

06:47.940 --> 06:50.932
Uh, no, no problem.
But, you know, I was just...

06:51.110 --> 06:52.771
<i>I was thinking about football...</i>

06:52.945 --> 06:55.937
I was actually worried
about LT this weekend.

06:56.115 --> 06:57.673
This is not my Uncle Pete.

06:57.850 --> 07:00.318
No, it's me, it's Uncle Pete. Come on.

07:00.486 --> 07:03.080
You used to sit on my lap,
pony rides, Pete.

07:03.255 --> 07:07.783
No, my Uncle Pete had his larynx taken out.
He talks through a hole in his neck now.

07:07.960 --> 07:10.190
- It's a miracle.
- Cut the crap, buddy, all right?

07:10.362 --> 07:13.661
You think I've never been pumped
for some fantasy-football information?

07:13.832 --> 07:15.322
<i>I once had a policeman...</i>

07:15.501 --> 07:19.062
...pull me over just to see whether or not
he should start Kurt Warner...

07:19.238 --> 07:20.728
...or Donovan McNabb.

07:20.906 --> 07:23.704
Just hook me up once, please.
Is LT gonna play?

07:23.876 --> 07:25.309
You got some balls, kid.

07:25.477 --> 07:28.708
- Two small ones but I'm trying to use them.
<i>- I do admire that.</i>

07:28.881 --> 07:30.974
I'll answer your question. Yes, definitely.

07:31.150 --> 07:32.378
- Yes?
<i>- Absolutely.</i>

07:32.551 --> 07:34.610
Starting, good shape.

07:34.787 --> 07:37.017
I am sending you a fruit basket, sir.
Thank you.

07:37.189 --> 07:38.781
- You know this number?
- Yes, sir.

07:38.957 --> 07:41.892
- Lose it.
- Thank you, sir, thank you.

07:42.127 --> 07:44.459
Bradshaw on the phone, LT on the field.

07:44.630 --> 07:45.858
Unstoppable.

07:46.031 --> 07:47.521
- Oh...
- Hi.

07:47.700 --> 07:49.099
Almost game time. Let's do it.

07:49.268 --> 07:51.793
Hold your horses.
Hold your horses, okay?

07:51.970 --> 07:53.631
We gotta talk some ground rules.

07:53.806 --> 07:56.969
If you don't mind sanitizing your hands
before you see baby Jeffrey.

07:57.142 --> 07:58.734
Don't ask these people, tell them.

07:58.911 --> 07:59.969
Cover yourself in this.

08:00.145 --> 08:02.409
Put it on the rug rat.
Taco, take a bath in it.

08:02.581 --> 08:04.139
- Can I drink it?
- It's like holy water.

08:04.616 --> 08:08.108
Let us all anoint our hands
before we touch the baby Jesus...

08:08.287 --> 08:10.312
...for he has come to save the world.

08:10.489 --> 08:12.013
You joke, but it's true.

08:12.191 --> 08:14.056
- Oh, hey.
- Oh, yeah.

08:14.626 --> 08:15.650
It's a baby.

08:15.828 --> 08:17.022
- Look at the baby.
- Goodness.

08:17.196 --> 08:18.356
- He's beautiful.
- He is.

08:18.530 --> 08:19.588
- He's wonderful.
- Yeah.

08:19.765 --> 08:22.359
Beautiful? He's got the Ruxin face.

08:24.269 --> 08:27.170
We used to be two.
Now we're a Holy Trinity.

08:27.339 --> 08:30.399
- It's beautiful.
- How'd your mom like the christening?

08:30.576 --> 08:33.544
I told her the church
was like a really progressive synagogue.

08:33.712 --> 08:35.509
Who did you go with for godparents?

08:35.681 --> 08:38.376
It was supposed to be
Pete and Meegan until:

08:39.784 --> 08:40.876
Yeah.

08:41.053 --> 08:44.853
Just because I'm single that doesn't
disqualify me from being a godparent.

08:45.023 --> 08:48.424
Seriously, I have been a great godfather
to Ellie. Have I not?

08:48.594 --> 08:51.119
Whoa, I thought I was Ellie's godfather.

08:52.998 --> 08:54.863
- Yeah.
- Yes, you know, you are.

08:55.033 --> 08:57.797
I was thinking of something different,
and you're a great godfather.

08:57.970 --> 09:01.599
Yeah, because when you guys die
of cancer, car accident, whatever...

09:01.774 --> 09:03.366
...I'm gonna move into your house.

09:03.542 --> 09:05.737
Bring my puzzles,
my slingshot, my Sega Genesis.

09:05.911 --> 09:08.641
Gonna hang out with Ellie all day.
It's gonna be awesome.

09:08.814 --> 09:11.681
Taco, I'm gonna be around
a long time, okay?

09:11.850 --> 09:13.215
Yeah, but she probably won't.

09:13.385 --> 09:15.717
- I'm standing right here.
- I'm just saying that...

09:15.888 --> 09:19.085
Unless the son of Ruxin
starts spouting off the scores, I think...

09:19.258 --> 09:20.486
All right, you're excused.

09:20.659 --> 09:21.785
- Thank you.
- Yes.

09:21.960 --> 09:25.020
Get all single men out of here.
Anyone with communicable diseases.

09:25.197 --> 09:26.630
- So, Jenny...
- Suck it, Ruxin.

09:26.799 --> 09:28.323
- Hi, buddy. Hi, buddy.
- Yeah.

09:28.500 --> 09:30.968
- Ellie, you wanna meet Jeffrey?
- Come here, sweetie.

09:31.136 --> 09:32.467
Step up and say hello.

09:34.473 --> 09:35.497
Hello.

09:35.674 --> 09:38.006
- Ellie is such an angel.
- Thank you.

09:38.177 --> 09:40.338
- She is so well behaved.
- She is so smart.

09:40.512 --> 09:42.844
- They pick up things at that age.
- Oh, yeah.

09:43.015 --> 09:44.414
She picks everything up.

09:44.583 --> 09:48.110
- Picks it up and she moves...
- She's brilliant.

09:48.287 --> 09:50.983
I have some snacks for you guys,
but please don't fill up.

09:51.156 --> 09:53.647
I have a very big,
delicious lunch coming up.

09:53.826 --> 09:56.021
Sounds good. Nice TV.

09:56.195 --> 09:57.822
- Need help in the kitchen?
- I do.

09:57.996 --> 10:01.363
- Well, let's do it, girlfriend.
- All right, Taco, bring it on.

10:01.533 --> 10:03.865
- What do we got here?
- Easy does it, sweetheart.

10:04.036 --> 10:06.129
Be easy. Oh, look at this.

10:06.305 --> 10:07.431
- Hey.
- Oh, hi.

10:07.606 --> 10:09.335
Guys, everybody, this is Cale.

10:09.508 --> 10:11.476
- What?
- I love Cale. Can I pet him?

10:11.643 --> 10:13.543
Ellie, go outside.

10:13.946 --> 10:15.777
- You named your dog Cale?
- Yeah.

10:15.948 --> 10:18.883
I told you in confidence
that we were trying to have another baby.

10:19.051 --> 10:21.144
If it was a boy,
we wanted to name it Cale.

10:21.320 --> 10:23.220
It's a great name.
We can share the name.

10:23.388 --> 10:25.481
- No, we're not sharing Cale.
- No, I'm not...

10:25.657 --> 10:26.851
The dog looks like a Cale.

10:27.025 --> 10:29.721
- I mean, look at him, he's a Cale.
- I hate you.

10:29.895 --> 10:31.021
You screwed me here.

10:31.196 --> 10:35.428
Because now, instead of Cale, we're gonna
have to name him after one of her uncles.

10:35.601 --> 10:37.159
- What's that name?
- Moral.

10:37.336 --> 10:39.304
Moral MacArthur.

10:39.471 --> 10:41.132
He sounds like a Civil War general.

10:41.306 --> 10:44.434
- Can you change your dog's name?
- This dog's real, your baby's hypothetical.

10:44.610 --> 10:46.077
And I think a mistake.

10:46.912 --> 10:48.277
Dick.

10:53.401 --> 10:55.562
- Sorry, I can't talk to you right now, bye.
- Oh, God.

10:56.937 --> 10:59.735
Hey, your week two champion
has arrived.

10:59.907 --> 11:01.067
Oh, stop, all right?

11:01.242 --> 11:03.176
It's week three. Get over it, sit down.

11:03.344 --> 11:05.175
- Center seat for the winner.
- Sit down.

11:05.346 --> 11:07.075
There's a crack. You wanna sit there?

11:07.248 --> 11:08.977
- Watch it.
- Just go.

11:09.150 --> 11:11.380
- Pick a nice seat there.
- Get here on time.

11:11.552 --> 11:15.113
- That's Cale's seat, but I'll let you sit in it.
- By the way, awesome name.

11:15.289 --> 11:16.313
- Great dog.
- Thanks.

11:16.490 --> 11:19.755
Ruxin, why are we watching a baby in
picture-in-picture here? What's happening?

11:19.927 --> 11:23.192
I got Jeffrey on the baby cam there,
so we can watch him...

11:23.397 --> 11:24.989
...while the game is going on.

11:25.166 --> 11:26.690
- Wait, that's baby Jeffrey?
- Yeah.

11:26.867 --> 11:28.926
I heard if you look directly at him,
he'll blind you.

11:29.103 --> 11:30.570
The Ark of the Covenant,
he melts your face.

11:32.289 --> 11:33.620
That smells delicious.
You're a good helper, Taquito.

11:33.790 --> 11:36.281
- Oh, merci.
- Here, let me taste, let me taste.

11:36.560 --> 11:38.084
- Mm-hm.
- Good? Good?

11:38.261 --> 11:40.923
- Here. All it needs is for you to try it.
- Ahh.

11:41.098 --> 11:42.565
- Weird to you at all?
- This?

11:42.733 --> 11:43.859
- You're so awesome.
- No.

11:44.034 --> 11:47.834
There's a man in your kitchen performing
your husbandly duties with your wife.

11:48.004 --> 11:49.904
- Doesn't bother you?
- Does it bother me...

11:50.073 --> 11:52.473
...that Taco is in my kitchen
blanching carrots...

11:52.642 --> 11:55.805
...while I'm out here drinking beer
and watching football?

11:55.979 --> 11:57.776
No. No, it doesn't bother me.

11:57.948 --> 12:00.576
- I do not have a great butt.
- You do have a great butt.

12:00.751 --> 12:01.809
I have a theory.

12:01.985 --> 12:05.250
So in horse racing, oftentimes
they'll bring in a lesser horse...

12:05.422 --> 12:08.482
...get the mare all riled up,
excited, feeling it.

12:08.658 --> 12:11.286
And right as he's about to blow,
they yank him out...

12:11.461 --> 12:13.224
...and bring in the breeding stallion.

12:13.397 --> 12:14.830
Hello. Heh, heh.

12:14.998 --> 12:18.092
You have a great butt.
You got that Latin butt going on, seriously.

12:18.268 --> 12:22.261
- So Taco's essentially your teasing stallion?
- Nailed it.

12:22.839 --> 12:25.399
Don't you spank me.
Don't you spank me.

12:25.575 --> 12:27.975
Wait, I noticed
that you're starting LT this week.

12:28.412 --> 12:30.277
That's a bold choice, right?

12:30.447 --> 12:32.972
- You played LT this week?
- Yeah, of course I did.

12:33.150 --> 12:35.516
- How do you know he's gonna play?
- I feel pretty confident about it.

12:37.154 --> 12:39.418
Sweet ringtone.
You changed it from Limp Bizkit?

12:39.589 --> 12:41.056
Yep. Hey.

12:42.426 --> 12:46.021
Hey, hey, giggly, it's rude to talk
on the phone in front of your friends.

12:46.196 --> 12:48.221
- This is the third call.
- Hold on one sec?

12:48.398 --> 12:51.561
- Are you dealing now? What's happening?
- Okay, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

12:52.102 --> 12:54.696
He didn't know it was a bye week?

12:55.172 --> 12:57.663
Oh, dude,
I am going to crush the Hammer.

12:58.074 --> 13:00.338
I gotta go, man.
I can't talk to you, it's...

13:03.146 --> 13:04.477
Um, I gotta go.

13:04.848 --> 13:06.008
What you doing?

13:06.416 --> 13:07.974
- Checking out these books.
- Yeah?

13:08.151 --> 13:09.175
Who you talking to?

13:10.353 --> 13:12.981
- No one.
- I'm gonna ask you one more time.

13:13.990 --> 13:15.321
Who you talking to?

13:16.092 --> 13:18.322
- I'm in another league.
- I knew it.

13:18.795 --> 13:20.228
How long have you been in it?

13:20.397 --> 13:21.887
- Is this serious?
- I love it.

13:22.065 --> 13:24.431
- I'm a king there, they love me.
- What?

13:24.601 --> 13:27.399
And it's been
the best three weeks of my life.

13:27.571 --> 13:29.436
They don't make fun of me.
They like me.

13:29.606 --> 13:32.507
- They think I'm funny...
- Settle down a bit, we're gonna...

13:32.676 --> 13:35.076
We're hearing you,
and we're gonna try harder.

13:35.245 --> 13:36.974
You're gonna stop making fun
of my teeth?

13:37.180 --> 13:38.511
- No.
- Yes.

13:38.849 --> 13:40.646
You're not gonna keep on making jokes?

13:40.851 --> 13:42.648
You mean that the semen's dissolving
all the enamel?

13:44.103 --> 13:45.730
I knew it. Go ahead, laugh.

13:45.904 --> 13:46.928
I know it's in there.

13:47.106 --> 13:48.573
- Don't laugh.
- Yeah, laugh it up.

13:48.741 --> 13:51.767
- That wasn't funny. You're right.
- It's hilarious to you guys.

13:51.944 --> 13:54.879
But I have a disease. A periodontal disease.

13:55.047 --> 13:58.039
I can show you the prescriptions I have
for a special toothpaste.

13:58.217 --> 14:00.117
So does my grandfather. I'm sorry.

14:00.285 --> 14:01.946
That's exactly what I'm talking about.

14:02.121 --> 14:03.713
Those guys, you know what they say?

14:03.889 --> 14:05.584
"Oh, Andre, is that too hot for you?

14:05.758 --> 14:08.921
Oh, Andre, we care about your enamel."

14:09.128 --> 14:12.461
Do they say, "Oh, Andre, can we shoot it
in the back of your mouth"?

14:12.631 --> 14:14.121
We're getting off track here.

14:14.299 --> 14:16.927
Sometimes we're not the best
at expressing our emotions.

14:17.102 --> 14:18.626
But that's why you belong.

14:18.804 --> 14:21.272
You're the glue
that holds the whole group together.

14:21.440 --> 14:22.566
You're the centerpiece.

14:22.741 --> 14:25.938
You're like the honeydew in a fruit salad,
you know.

14:26.111 --> 14:27.305
Nobody likes the honeydew.

14:27.479 --> 14:29.640
But you need it because it fills up space.

14:29.815 --> 14:32.978
The point he's saying
is this is less about you than it is about us.

14:33.152 --> 14:35.086
Without you, we'd eat our own, man.

14:35.254 --> 14:37.085
Can I bring maybe one of those guys?

14:37.256 --> 14:39.224
- No, not a chance.
- No.

14:39.391 --> 14:40.983
We need you to take care of this.

14:41.160 --> 14:43.720
Want you to call those guys,
break up with that league.

14:43.896 --> 14:46.091
Okay. Well, we'll see.

14:46.865 --> 14:49.425
You know what's important.
Make that call.

14:49.868 --> 14:52.962
Yes, Maurice Jones-Drew,
three touchdowns.

14:53.138 --> 14:55.197
- Give me some sugar.
- Yeah.

14:55.374 --> 14:56.534
Hey, where's Ellie?

14:56.708 --> 14:57.732
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

14:57.910 --> 14:59.673
I put her down for a nap
a half-hour ago.

14:59.845 --> 15:01.369
Oh, good thinking.

15:01.547 --> 15:03.378
- Lunch is ready.
- Awesome.

15:03.549 --> 15:05.449
- Food.
- It smells really good, Sofia.

15:05.818 --> 15:07.080
Fantastic.

15:07.252 --> 15:09.413
Get some food
and head back to the table.

15:09.588 --> 15:11.488
Nope. Uh-uh. That's not lunch.

15:11.657 --> 15:12.681
Follow me.

15:12.858 --> 15:14.086
Where are we going?

15:14.259 --> 15:18.195
You guys are in for quite the treat.
Lots of yum-yums for your tum-tums.

15:18.397 --> 15:20.865
- Ta-da!
- All right.

15:21.033 --> 15:23.968
- Have a seat.
- Is it just like grab a plate and then...

15:24.536 --> 15:26.094
- Exciting.
- No, you sit down.

15:26.271 --> 15:27.670
- Have a seat.
- Great.

15:27.840 --> 15:29.273
This is Sunday, relax.

15:29.441 --> 15:32.740
It's a long lunch,
and we have lots of food coming out.

15:32.911 --> 15:35.709
First course is shrimp cocktail. Enjoy.

15:35.881 --> 15:37.576
- Thanks, Sofia. Looks great.
- Thanks.

15:37.749 --> 15:39.046
Thank you.

15:39.218 --> 15:40.242
First course?

15:40.419 --> 15:42.114
- First course?
- What?

15:42.287 --> 15:44.187
- Of how many?
- Don't know. Three or four.

15:44.356 --> 15:45.823
Goods not as advertised, Ruxin.

15:45.991 --> 15:51.088
Excuse me, I apologize if I wanted to bask
in the reflective glow of my close friends.

15:51.263 --> 15:53.993
We wanna watch the football games.
What are you doing?

15:54.166 --> 15:55.929
- Fuck you, Ruxin!
- Jesus, Andre.

15:56.101 --> 15:57.568
Look, guys, relax.

15:57.736 --> 16:00.227
Look, my wife is in the mood
to cook a Sunday lunch.

16:00.405 --> 16:04.136
If I'm not allowed to watch the games,
none of you can watch the games.

16:04.309 --> 16:07.437
- That's very sweet, thank you.
- I have put the games on pause.

16:07.613 --> 16:11.549
- All we need to do is respect the pause.
- That doesn't work.

16:11.717 --> 16:14.777
We just need to go on
an information lockdown.

16:14.953 --> 16:17.114
- Doesn't work. I don't trust you.
- This one's a spy.

16:17.289 --> 16:18.688
Me? You don't trust me?

16:18.857 --> 16:22.156
- I don't trust him, look at that shirt.
- I don't trust myself in my heart.

16:22.327 --> 16:25.125
I don't trust any of you,
but I'm willing to try.

16:25.297 --> 16:27.561
- Don't touch me.
- We need to police each other...

16:27.733 --> 16:31.134
...like in Communist Russia.
- This is gonna be, like, football Gestapo.

16:31.303 --> 16:33.430
- No, that's Germany.
- They both got it done.

16:35.073 --> 16:37.439
- Salad plane, coming through.
- You're so funny.

16:37.609 --> 16:39.440
- Yes.
- All right.

16:39.611 --> 16:42.307
Second part of course one, guys,
let's get those greens.

16:42.481 --> 16:45.177
Sofia thought that maybe
we should do this buffet-style.

16:45.350 --> 16:47.648
Good idea. Let's do it.

16:47.819 --> 16:50.788
- He had this great idea...
- How food like this has to be savored.

16:50.956 --> 16:52.548
- Yes.
- Gotta sit and enjoy it.

16:52.724 --> 16:55.386
- Enjoy each other's company.
- That's what we were doing.

16:55.561 --> 16:58.029
- In the other room, watching football.
- Yeah, right.

16:58.196 --> 16:59.595
Hey, dig in everyone. All right.

17:00.966 --> 17:02.365
- Mmm.
- Mm.

17:02.534 --> 17:04.262
Let's do it.

17:06.371 --> 17:07.531
- I'm done.
- Done.

17:07.705 --> 17:10.675
- Done.
- Paella time.

17:10.842 --> 17:11.773
Beep, beep.

17:13.493 --> 17:14.483
Aww!

17:14.662 --> 17:16.095
He means, oh, yeah.

17:17.830 --> 17:19.627
- They're watching the games next door.
- What game is on now?

17:19.800 --> 17:22.769
- We're missing everything.
- Abide by the pause.

17:22.936 --> 17:25.166
- This is bullshit.
- Abide by the pause.

17:25.339 --> 17:27.739
- This is lovely, thank you very much.
- Thank you.

17:27.907 --> 17:29.739
I'm just gonna go to the restroom.

17:29.910 --> 17:32.470
- Thank you very much.
- Oh, I'll show you where it is.

17:32.646 --> 17:35.240
- I know where it is.
- No, we remodeled.

17:35.416 --> 17:38.749
- I think I can find it.
- I insist.

17:39.086 --> 17:41.247
- How far are you gonna take this?
- All the way.

17:41.422 --> 17:43.481
- You wanna hold it?
- lf I have to.

17:44.658 --> 17:47.252
And here comes the soup.

17:47.428 --> 17:49.555
- Watch out, it's piping hot.
- Awesome.

17:49.730 --> 17:51.129
Can we get one cool for Andre?

17:51.298 --> 17:53.528
- He actually has really sensitive teeth.
- Yeah.

17:53.701 --> 17:55.293
- Really?
- Absolutely, you do.

17:55.469 --> 17:58.529
- You deserve that.
- Yeah, I do.

17:58.706 --> 18:00.606
Um, I gotta go make a call.

18:00.774 --> 18:03.766
- You're not going anywhere.
- I have to check in with a patient.

18:03.944 --> 18:05.002
Let him go.

18:05.179 --> 18:09.138
Hey, you guys are unbelievable.

18:09.350 --> 18:11.147
But, um...

18:11.518 --> 18:14.282
...there is another league.

18:14.455 --> 18:17.288
What is he saying to his patient?

18:17.458 --> 18:20.018
Something like,
"Hey, I heard this is an emergency.

18:20.194 --> 18:21.684
It's me, Dr. Andre."

18:21.862 --> 18:26.663
"Oh, Dr. Andre,
you know those calf implants you gave me?

18:26.834 --> 18:28.461
Well, it's making it hard to get...

18:28.636 --> 18:32.402
...my bedazzled Ed Hardy
skinny jeans up over my legs."

18:32.573 --> 18:35.303
I wanna be with you guys.
I wanna be on the party bus.

18:35.476 --> 18:37.341
But I can't.

18:37.945 --> 18:39.742
Because I already got a party bus.

18:39.913 --> 18:41.210
And those guys are great.

18:41.382 --> 18:43.509
"Oh, you wearing a stupid hat?"

18:43.684 --> 18:45.208
"You know I am. I'm Dr. Andre."

18:45.386 --> 18:51.655
Just tell the rest of The Fantasy League
of Extraordinary Gentlemen that I'm sorry.

18:51.825 --> 18:56.057
And tell Hammer I'll miss him most of all.

18:56.330 --> 18:59.595
- Hey, you take care of business?
- Yeah, it's over.

18:59.767 --> 19:02.099
Thank you so much
for coming to our lunch.

19:02.269 --> 19:04.897
Thank you, Taco.
I hope you had a great time.

19:05.072 --> 19:07.404
- Wait, so... Are we finished?
- Yes.

19:07.574 --> 19:10.099
- Thank you very much, it was excellent.
- Thank you.

19:10.277 --> 19:12.006
Guys, there's some dessert, guys.

19:12.179 --> 19:13.703
Finally. Jesus.

19:14.448 --> 19:15.437
- Wait, wait.
- Hurry up, sit, sit, sit.

19:15.616 --> 19:16.378
- Stop.
- Go.

19:17.933 --> 19:20.231
<i>Hello, everyone.</i>
<i>I'm Terry Bradshaw from Fox Sports Studio.</i>

19:20.735 --> 19:21.963
<i>This NFL update:</i>

19:22.137 --> 19:25.868
<i>Star running back LaDainian Tomlinson</i>
<i>of the San Diego Chargers...</i>

19:26.041 --> 19:27.531
<i>...will not start today...</i>

19:27.709 --> 19:31.008
- What?
- <i>...as the Chargers host the Miami Dolphins.</i>

19:31.179 --> 19:33.409
- I told you.
- You lie.

19:35.016 --> 19:37.484
You lost, I win. Two weeks in a row.

19:38.853 --> 19:40.844
- Two for two.
- Could happen to anyone.

19:41.022 --> 19:42.046
Hello?

19:42.224 --> 19:44.590
- <i>Hey, Pete, it's Terry Bradshaw.</i>
- Hello there.

19:44.759 --> 19:47.853
You think I'm gonna let you cheat
your friends just so you can win?

19:48.029 --> 19:50.691
- Man, I was kind of hoping you would.
- <i>Ain't gonna happen.</i>

19:50.865 --> 19:53.425
- <i>And one other thing, you hear me?</i>
- What's that?

19:53.602 --> 19:56.901
I hated my Uncle Pete, you dickhead.

19:58.506 --> 19:59.871
- Great.
- Who was that?

20:00.041 --> 20:01.702
- That's my new mortal enemy.
- Andre?

20:01.876 --> 20:03.537
- Meegan?
- The dude deep-dicking Meegan?

20:03.712 --> 20:06.272
- Scintillating dinner conversation?
- Terry.

20:06.448 --> 20:12.250
It looks like you better sell your house,
because only winners live here.

20:12.621 --> 20:15.055
- Slam.
- Andre, that actually doesn't play.

20:15.223 --> 20:17.088
- Try something else.
- I got a slam list.

20:17.259 --> 20:18.556
- Oh, good, good, yeah.
- What?

20:18.727 --> 20:20.092
- Slam list.
- Slam list.

20:20.262 --> 20:22.230
In case you have to battle-rap someone?

20:22.397 --> 20:23.955
Okay, this is a good one. Um...

20:24.432 --> 20:26.491
You better be careful, my lady...

20:26.668 --> 20:29.034
...because Jack the Ripper's
slicing up losers.

20:30.772 --> 20:32.205
Right?

20:32.374 --> 20:35.571
- I can't even come back from that.
- And that's why I write it down.

20:35.744 --> 20:37.473
Cale, come here.

20:38.947 --> 20:40.141
Cale?

20:42.851 --> 20:44.478
Cale's made a doodie.

20:47.389 --> 20:49.914
Some Bud Light Lime for Andre.

20:50.525 --> 20:52.720
- How you doing, baby?
- Mmm.

20:52.894 --> 20:55.124
- This whole day has been amazing.
- Oh, yeah?

20:55.297 --> 20:56.924
- Lunch turned out so delicious.
- Mm-hm.

20:57.098 --> 20:58.929
- Oh, I had so much fun.
- Good.

20:59.100 --> 21:02.035
- And we're gonna have fun. Mm-hm.
- Oh, really? Well, good.

21:04.205 --> 21:06.537
I got the spoons and
the cinnamon for the coffee.

21:06.708 --> 21:08.573
- All right.
- He's such a good helper.

21:08.743 --> 21:11.473
He is. Looks like you kids
got this under control.

21:11.646 --> 21:14.740
Hey, can you give my girl a foot rub
if she needs one?

21:14.916 --> 21:16.884
Foot rubs are my specialty.

21:17.052 --> 21:19.782
- Thank you, Ruxin.
- It's the least I could do.

21:19.954 --> 21:22.013
- You have any peppermint oil?
- You know I do.

21:22.190 --> 21:24.556
All right, I'll take care
of your little footsies.

21:24.726 --> 21:28.127
- Oh, he's not getting up.
- Oh, no. He hurt his ankle.

21:28.296 --> 21:30.093
Frank Gore's... Frank Gore's out, man.

21:30.265 --> 21:31.197
Who...? Who's got his backup?

21:32.917 --> 21:34.214
- Glen Coffee?
- Yeah, who's got Glen Coffee?

21:34.719 --> 21:39.088
I don't know who's got Glen Coffee.

21:39.256 --> 21:40.746
I would think that it would be...

21:40.925 --> 21:42.654
- Hey, give me.
- Ow, ow!

21:42.827 --> 21:44.260
- Don't even.
- Refresh!

21:44.428 --> 21:45.452
- Refresh.
- Refresh.

21:45.629 --> 21:47.324
Oh!

21:48.032 --> 21:52.492
Ladies and gentlemen, the newest
member of the Double Ent-Andres...

21:52.670 --> 21:54.103
...Mr. Glen Coffee.

21:54.271 --> 21:56.603
- That was too fast.
- No, host gets first dibs.

21:56.774 --> 22:00.210
- What are you talking about?
- I'm telling you, since the days of Lombardi.

22:00.378 --> 22:02.710
I got him fair and square.

22:02.880 --> 22:04.472
You know what I just realized?

22:04.648 --> 22:07.947
You were out on the phone earlier.

22:08.119 --> 22:11.680
My guess is you got a little tip
that Frank Gore had gotten injured.

22:11.856 --> 22:13.687
You did not respect the pause.

22:13.858 --> 22:16.156
- I don't respect the pause?
- You did not.

22:16.327 --> 22:18.158
- Do you know what I was doing?
- What?

22:18.329 --> 22:20.194
I was breaking up with my other league.

22:20.464 --> 22:21.294
- Oh, God
- Oh, boy.

22:22.782 --> 22:23.908
- Excuse me, they knew?
- Sorry.

22:24.083 --> 22:25.880
- Yes, relax.
- Are you joking me?

22:26.052 --> 22:29.180
Have you guys been working in collusion?
You're all against me.

22:29.355 --> 22:30.913
That's why I've never won.

22:31.090 --> 22:32.990
Give us a ruling. Who gets Glen Coffee?

22:33.159 --> 22:35.559
No way the commissioner
can give a fair ruling.

22:35.728 --> 22:39.755
Look, Ruxin, I am perfectly capable
of giving an impartial ruling, all right?

22:39.932 --> 22:41.661
Even though you stole my son's name...

22:41.834 --> 22:44.098
No way.
...and you know you did do it...

22:44.270 --> 22:46.534
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Guys, situation developing.

22:46.705 --> 22:50.232
Picture-in-picture. Ellie is bringing
a special gift to baby Ruxin.

22:50.409 --> 22:52.934
And if memory serves,
I believe that's a turd.

22:53.112 --> 22:54.704
What is she doing? No.

22:54.880 --> 22:57.110
- She's going, she's on the 15.
- Don't do it.

22:57.283 --> 22:59.877
She's on the 10.
She's on the five, she's reaching.

23:00.052 --> 23:01.519
- Touchdown!
- What did she do?

23:01.687 --> 23:04.520
- Six points for Ellie.
- What is your filthy daughter doing?

23:04.690 --> 23:06.920
All the Purell in the world
not gonna fix that.

23:07.126 --> 23:09.492
- It's just a phase she's going through.
- A phase?

23:09.662 --> 23:10.993
- Fun with feces.
- Fun with feces.

23:11.163 --> 23:13.358
You know who has fun with feces?
Psychopaths.

23:13.532 --> 23:16.592
- You saying my daughter's a psychopath?
- She should be sent abroad.

23:16.769 --> 23:19.465
Maybe she could go to Mexico
and have a fecal fiesta.

23:19.638 --> 23:22.038
Or perhaps Brazil for a caca carnival.

23:22.208 --> 23:23.402
What the hell is going on?

23:23.576 --> 23:25.407
Did I hear something about a carnival?

23:26.812 --> 23:28.973
- Out.
- Get out.

23:29.615 --> 23:33.312
- Next weekend, same time, same place?
- You host a magnificent party, Sofia.

23:33.486 --> 23:35.317
- It's not my fault.
- It's your fault.

23:35.488 --> 23:38.821
- Over the name Cale?
- Yeah, it's lost some of its luster.

23:38.991 --> 23:41.289
You're right.
This league is a lot more fun.

23:41.961 --> 23:43.758
Isn't it, though?
