00:00.709 --> 00:03.166
(gentle music)

00:17.208 --> 00:22.041
(soldier speaking
in foreign language)

00:23.417 --> 00:26.208
(dramatic music)

00:43.291 --> 00:44.834
I got something to
tell you, Smith,

00:46.250 --> 00:49.291
something I never thought
I'd hear myself say to you.

00:49.375 --> 00:50.417
- Just spill it.

00:50.500 --> 00:52.333
Save these two
privates the headache.

00:52.417 --> 00:54.291
(both laughing)

00:58.583 --> 01:00.208
- I want you to
be her godfather.

01:02.041 --> 01:03.125
- Oh, damn.

01:03.208 --> 01:04.250
- Congratulations, sir.
- Thank you.

01:04.333 --> 01:06.291
- That's some news.

01:06.375 --> 01:08.291
Congrats to you too, sir.

01:08.375 --> 01:12.625
- Hey, Uncle Smith. (laughing)
- Uncle Smitty, fits you, man.

01:12.709 --> 01:15.166
- I didn't see this coming.
- I know, I got you.

01:16.208 --> 01:19.417
- [Smith] Congratulations,
my brother, mwah.

01:19.500 --> 01:22.625
- All right, all right,
all right. (Smith laughing)

01:22.709 --> 01:24.041
- She's beautiful.

01:25.417 --> 01:26.709
Looks just like her mother.

01:27.709 --> 01:29.917
We're going viral on
the web with this one.

01:30.000 --> 01:31.333
- Ah, bullshit.

01:31.417 --> 01:33.291
- Don't underestimate
Uncle Smith.

01:35.125 --> 01:36.250
Yeah.

01:36.333 --> 01:38.917
Mwah.

01:39.000 --> 01:40.458
- [Private] Ready?

01:40.542 --> 01:44.333
Here we go, all right, one, two.

01:44.417 --> 01:47.166
(explosion rumbling)

01:47.250 --> 01:51.375
(dramatic music)
(guns firing)

02:13.625 --> 02:15.417
(men shouting)

02:25.041 --> 02:28.959
(speech drowned out by music)

02:31.500 --> 02:34.375
(private screaming)

02:49.834 --> 02:50.583
- Go!

02:51.458 --> 02:56.458
(soldier shouting
in foreign language)

03:13.709 --> 03:17.375
(speech drowned out by music)

03:33.792 --> 03:36.667
(explosion hissing)

03:39.834 --> 03:40.667
Get down!

03:41.959 --> 03:42.333
Get down!

03:42.417 --> 03:45.417
(somber music)

04:03.208 --> 04:04.291
- You gonna learn,
you gonna make money,

04:04.375 --> 04:06.625
you gonna make a living,
but the problem is,

04:08.333 --> 04:11.500
you're gonna be away, so
you have to deal with it.

04:11.583 --> 04:17.416
I've been on the road New
Year's Eve seven years in a row.

04:18.750 --> 04:20.834
Sometimes I didn't remember
what the hell was going on

04:20.916 --> 04:22.500
on the first. (laughing)

04:22.583 --> 04:23.375
- Oh, was it?
- Okay.

04:24.542 --> 04:25.500
Go ahead and hit the button.

04:25.583 --> 04:28.083
- Hey, sweetie, how's it going?

04:28.166 --> 04:29.500
- Hi, Dad.

04:29.583 --> 04:31.500
Uncle Todd and I
are here with Mom.

04:33.291 --> 04:34.500
- Another year, sis.

04:34.583 --> 04:36.500
Eden's seven years old now.

04:38.083 --> 04:39.458
- We were in the
garden today, Dad.

04:39.542 --> 04:42.291
Still feels weird
without Mom here.

04:42.375 --> 04:42.500
- Yeah, I know baby.

04:44.500 --> 04:46.375
But she's looking over
us every day, okay?

04:48.750 --> 04:49.667
Remember what I told you, right?

04:49.750 --> 04:50.583
You can call me here anytime.

04:52.750 --> 04:53.875
It doesn't matter
what time it is.

04:53.959 --> 04:55.041
- When are you coming back?

04:55.125 --> 04:59.750
- Soon, yeah, really soon.

04:59.834 --> 05:01.458
Just gotta finish some work here

05:01.542 --> 05:04.125
and I'll be back
before you know it.

05:04.208 --> 05:04.917
And when I get back,
we're getting a big place.

05:08.000 --> 05:09.250
- Can we get a dog?

05:09.333 --> 05:13.875
(Dane chuckling)
(Todd laughing)

05:13.959 --> 05:15.375
- Sure, why not?

05:15.458 --> 05:16.291
- Promise?

05:16.959 --> 05:18.083
- I promise.

05:23.375 --> 05:24.125
- Uncle Ross is here.

05:24.208 --> 05:25.083
Going to go say hi.

05:25.166 --> 05:27.709
- Let me talk to your dad.

05:27.792 --> 05:29.250
- Love you.

05:29.333 --> 05:31.083
- Love you too, Dad.
- Go.

05:34.625 --> 05:35.500
She's cute.

05:36.542 --> 05:38.291
- And growing up way too fast.

05:39.333 --> 05:41.291
Just wish Zoe was
here to see it all.

05:43.834 --> 05:45.291
I appreciate you, Todd.

05:45.375 --> 05:47.625
After this contract gig, I'll
be in a much better place.

05:47.709 --> 05:51.417
- There's really no reason
for you to do this trucking.

05:51.500 --> 05:53.583
- But I really think this
is a good thing for me.

05:53.667 --> 05:55.583
I'll soon be in a place
where I can support her,

05:55.667 --> 05:59.834
pay you and Ross back for
everything you guys have done.

05:59.917 --> 06:00.625
Catching up.

06:02.750 --> 06:03.583
- We're just helping our family.

06:07.458 --> 06:09.959
- Well, looks like I
gotta go hit the road,

06:10.041 --> 06:14.458
so tell Ross I said hi.

06:16.333 --> 06:18.125
Have fun at the party tonight.

06:18.208 --> 06:19.083
- Thank you.

06:19.667 --> 06:20.542
Be careful out there.

06:34.875 --> 06:37.542
(jazzy music)

06:41.875 --> 06:43.125
(women laughing)

06:43.208 --> 06:46.333
(people chattering)

07:28.000 --> 07:30.166
- [All] One!

07:30.250 --> 07:32.750
(all cheering)

07:37.917 --> 07:40.375
- Happy new year.
- Eden, come on.

07:40.458 --> 07:42.291
Put this away, it's New Year's.

07:42.375 --> 07:43.792
- Happy new year.
- Yeah!

07:44.625 --> 07:45.875
It's New Year's.

07:45.959 --> 07:47.333
- How often do you get to
stay up this late, huh?

07:47.417 --> 07:49.875
- [Ross] I know, we're
the coolest uncles ever.

07:49.959 --> 07:51.667
- [Todd and Ross] Mwah.

07:51.750 --> 07:52.875
- [Todd] Happy new year.

07:52.959 --> 07:53.875
- [Ross] Happy new--

07:53.959 --> 07:55.333
- Aren't you guys
supposed to be kissing?

07:55.417 --> 07:56.375
- [Both] Oh.

07:56.458 --> 07:57.083
- All right.
- Smart kid, that one.

07:57.166 --> 07:58.291
- Yes, she is.

07:58.375 --> 07:59.083
- [Todd and Ross] Mwah.

07:59.166 --> 07:59.709
- There you go.

07:59.792 --> 08:01.500
Go play with real people.

08:01.583 --> 08:04.375
- I'm gonna hold on to
this, okay? (chuckling)

08:05.875 --> 08:08.750
(suspenseful music)

08:24.583 --> 08:27.333
- Hi.

08:27.417 --> 08:32.207
- Happy new year.
- Happy new year.

08:32.291 --> 08:36.500
- I didn't know you were here.

08:36.582 --> 08:37.917
- I Just got here.

08:39.082 --> 08:41.500
You're almost as tall as me.

08:42.833 --> 08:46.208
- No, I'm not.

08:46.291 --> 08:48.709
- You like snails, don't you?

08:51.166 --> 08:54.417
(gasps) There you go.

08:54.500 --> 08:57.625
See, we got the matching ones.

08:58.917 --> 09:02.291
Shh, let's keep this
between you and I.

09:02.375 --> 09:03.250
Shh, okay?

09:05.709 --> 09:06.709
- Hey, hey.

09:06.792 --> 09:10.625
Hey, Eden, would you do
me a huge favor here?

09:10.709 --> 09:11.959
Hey, wait, hold on.

09:12.041 --> 09:13.500
Will you do me a favor and
go into the kitchen there

09:13.583 --> 09:14.834
and play with those kids?

09:14.917 --> 09:16.208
I need to talk to
Smith for a second.

09:16.291 --> 09:18.625
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

09:18.709 --> 09:20.500
Is that okay?
- See you later.

09:26.834 --> 09:27.375
- You don't have to get
gifts like that for her

09:27.458 --> 09:29.750
every time you see her.

09:29.834 --> 09:30.500
I mean, have you looked
at yourself lately, Smith?

09:30.583 --> 09:32.458
- What's that supposed to mean?

09:32.542 --> 09:33.834
- You're not leaving
anytime soon, right?

09:33.917 --> 09:35.542
- I was just talking
to my goddaughter.

09:35.625 --> 09:36.959
The hell you're coming
up to me like that?

09:37.041 --> 09:37.583
- Yeah, but she's my niece
and this is my house,

09:37.667 --> 09:39.709
so I suggest you leave.

09:39.792 --> 09:42.875
- Hey, hey, hey, what the
heck is going on here, guys?

09:42.959 --> 09:44.750
- Nothing, nothing.

09:44.834 --> 09:45.750
Smith was just leaving.

09:47.583 --> 09:48.458
Ain't that right?

09:53.667 --> 09:55.583
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

09:55.667 --> 09:57.667
- No, no, no, no,
don't stop him.

09:57.750 --> 10:00.000
I mean, have you smelled
the alcohol on him?

10:00.917 --> 10:02.333
- Wait, wait.

10:02.417 --> 10:03.166
What happened in there?

10:03.250 --> 10:04.000
- Nothing.

10:04.417 --> 10:05.750
- Don't go.

10:07.333 --> 10:09.667
- Your husband doesn't
want this guy in his house,

10:09.750 --> 10:11.208
so I'm out.

10:14.542 --> 10:14.834
- [Todd] Wait, please.

10:18.000 --> 10:20.667
- Thanks for hospitality.

10:20.750 --> 10:23.000
Happy fucking new year.

10:23.083 --> 10:25.583
(Todd sighing)

10:34.291 --> 10:36.250
- Hello, can I come in?
- Yes.

10:37.417 --> 10:40.083
- [Todd] What are you doing?

10:40.583 --> 10:43.166
(Eden mumbling)

10:43.250 --> 10:45.041
- You can make him
like a big giant.

10:45.125 --> 10:46.959
- [Todd] Oh, my goodness.

10:47.041 --> 10:48.083
That's a lot of candy.

10:48.166 --> 10:50.834
(dramatic music)

11:00.875 --> 11:02.834
(knocking on door)

11:16.959 --> 11:17.917
- Oh, my god.

11:19.125 --> 11:21.959
- Gross, candy and candy?
(Eden chuckling)

11:22.041 --> 11:23.375
(Todd laughing)

11:23.458 --> 11:26.417
- What kind of candy?
- I don't know.

11:27.959 --> 11:30.125
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

11:30.208 --> 11:32.959
(Eden screaming)

11:42.458 --> 11:46.250
(thunder rumbling)

11:49.709 --> 11:51.875
- [Shirley] Here's
your check, Detective.

11:51.959 --> 11:52.750
- Thanks.

11:58.208 --> 11:59.458
See you tomorrow, Shirley.

11:59.542 --> 12:01.834
- [Dispatcher] We have
a 10-7-1 at 11905 Vista.

12:03.208 --> 12:04.458
Additional units.

12:04.542 --> 12:06.500
- Unit 0619 here.
- Go ahead, Fini.

12:06.583 --> 12:07.583
Take that one.

12:07.667 --> 12:08.417
- Block off all streets
in a one-mile radius.

12:08.500 --> 12:10.959
No cars in or out.

12:11.041 --> 12:11.917
I'm in route.

12:14.166 --> 12:16.750
(siren wailing)

12:21.041 --> 12:23.709
(dramatic music)

12:26.709 --> 12:27.166
- [Walter] Did you
speak to the captain?

12:27.250 --> 12:28.625
- Yeah.

12:28.709 --> 12:31.125
- Masked man, beatings, blood.

12:31.208 --> 12:31.917
It's a fucking mess, come on.

12:37.709 --> 12:39.041
- [Fini] Get off of there.

12:40.792 --> 12:41.583
(camera shutter clicking)

12:41.667 --> 12:43.000
- This is Detective Fini.

12:45.125 --> 12:46.000
- Tanke.

12:48.166 --> 12:50.333
Okay, follow me up
the stairs here.

12:50.417 --> 12:51.250
Watch your step.

12:52.375 --> 12:55.000
Owners' names are Todd and
Ross Meisner, gay couple.

12:56.959 --> 12:57.625
Both were here
during the invasion,

12:57.709 --> 13:00.667
including their niece, Eden.

13:00.750 --> 13:01.542
She's missing.

13:03.208 --> 13:05.291
It's looking like
the invader came in

13:05.375 --> 13:06.917
through her bedroom downstairs.

13:13.000 --> 13:13.917
Then they came in here.

13:19.208 --> 13:21.208
- They've taken the couple
over to Saint Joseph's

13:21.291 --> 13:22.542
around 15 minutes ago.

13:22.625 --> 13:23.542
One of them is in
critical condition.

13:23.625 --> 13:26.208
That's all we know for now.

13:26.291 --> 13:28.000
- Do we have any
units over there?

13:28.083 --> 13:29.625
- Uh, two.

13:29.709 --> 13:31.417
- We should get their
statements ASAP.

13:31.500 --> 13:34.083
- I think Officer Enriquez
is getting the statements

13:34.166 --> 13:35.125
from the neighbors.

13:35.208 --> 13:37.000
I'll have him go
over right after.

13:38.208 --> 13:40.417
- Detective, you
should come see this.

13:40.917 --> 13:44.208
(thunder rumbling)

13:44.291 --> 13:47.375
We were lucky to catch this
before the rain started.

13:47.458 --> 13:50.208
We traced the blood
from the house out here.

13:50.291 --> 13:51.709
It goes all the way down there.

13:57.125 --> 13:59.083
(thunder rumbling)

14:01.667 --> 14:04.000
(dispatcher chattering)

14:04.083 --> 14:06.125
- We've a possible
suspect fleeing on foot.

14:06.208 --> 14:08.250
He's been on the run
for about 30 minutes.

14:08.333 --> 14:10.083
I need a hard target
search started immediately.

14:10.166 --> 14:14.583
That means all residences,
rest stops, gas stations.

14:14.667 --> 14:16.000
Don't leave anything out.

14:17.166 --> 14:18.959
Suspect might have also
abducted a seven-year-old girl,

14:19.041 --> 14:20.875
brunette, approach with caution.

14:27.166 --> 14:29.083
- What'd you find out?

14:29.166 --> 14:30.083
- We need to get that
girl's photo out there.

14:30.750 --> 14:33.583
Checkpoints up to 20 miles.

14:35.000 --> 14:36.875
We need to contact her parents.

14:44.917 --> 14:47.250
- [Scott] Hey, you done in here?

14:47.333 --> 14:49.458
- Yeah, just a few more things

14:49.542 --> 14:50.792
and we'll be good for the night.

14:50.875 --> 14:51.458
How you doing?

14:51.542 --> 14:51.959
- Oh, truck's empty.

14:52.041 --> 14:53.834
Ready to go, man.

14:53.917 --> 14:55.125
- Dane.

14:55.208 --> 14:56.875
Your boss man's been trying
to get a hold of you, man.

14:56.959 --> 14:58.250
Some kind of emergency
with your brother-in-law,

14:58.333 --> 14:59.709
says you need to
head home right now.

14:59.792 --> 15:01.125
Call him on the way.

15:01.208 --> 15:02.291
What's up, Scott?

15:02.375 --> 15:03.667
I can take you to the airport
right now if you want.

15:03.750 --> 15:04.208
- I got this, go.

15:04.291 --> 15:05.291
- Okay.
- Go.

15:15.542 --> 15:18.458
(monitor beeping)

15:20.291 --> 15:22.333
- [Fini] No one comes
in or out of this room

15:22.417 --> 15:23.291
except for staff.

15:23.375 --> 15:25.417
And keep that
24-hour watch on him.

15:25.500 --> 15:28.166
He's conscious, I need
to be the first to know.

15:28.250 --> 15:28.291
- Stay put.

15:33.750 --> 15:34.417
- Feeling better, Mr. Meisner?

15:34.500 --> 15:36.166
- Todd, please.

15:36.250 --> 15:39.291
Can you tell the nurse to
come unplug me from this?

15:39.375 --> 15:40.208
I need to see Ross.

15:40.291 --> 15:41.333
- I don't think
that's a good idea.

15:41.417 --> 15:43.333
He's safe in the other room.

15:43.417 --> 15:45.333
You should rest right now.

15:45.417 --> 15:46.959
I also have a few
questions for you

15:47.041 --> 15:50.000
while all of this is
still fresh to you.

15:50.083 --> 15:53.250
- I gave my statement to the
other officer. (clears throat)

15:53.333 --> 15:54.834
So is someone
looking for my niece?

15:54.917 --> 15:56.083
- We are.

15:56.166 --> 15:59.041
Did the invader make
any sort of demands?

15:59.125 --> 16:00.500
- We didn't exactly
have a conversation.

16:00.583 --> 16:02.208
It was very quick.

16:02.291 --> 16:03.542
He held us at gunpoint.

16:03.625 --> 16:06.166
He grabbed her.

16:06.250 --> 16:08.709
- Mr. Meisner, is there
anyone that you could think of

16:08.792 --> 16:10.875
that would want to do
harm to your family?

16:10.959 --> 16:11.750
- No.

16:12.875 --> 16:16.542
No, I mean, no one
that I know of.

16:16.625 --> 16:20.834
- Any enemies, recent
confrontations with anyone?

16:20.917 --> 16:22.750
- Most the people
we know are family

16:22.834 --> 16:26.208
or friends from Ross's work.

16:26.291 --> 16:27.208
We don't know the
kind of monster that--

16:27.291 --> 16:29.917
- Sir, sir, you can't
go in there, sir.

16:30.000 --> 16:30.166
- [Walter] It's fine.

16:33.041 --> 16:33.709
- What happened?

16:33.792 --> 16:34.625
Where's Eden?

16:35.125 --> 16:36.792
- Detective Fini.

16:38.250 --> 16:40.250
I'm leading the investigation.

16:40.333 --> 16:41.875
- Investigation?

16:42.000 --> 16:43.250
Ross is in a coma down the hall.

16:43.333 --> 16:43.917
What the hell happened?

16:44.000 --> 16:47.041
- Someone came in the house.

16:48.375 --> 16:50.458
- Mr. Hunte, there
was a home invasion.

16:50.542 --> 16:53.250
Your brother-in-law was
attacked, and your daughter,

16:55.500 --> 16:56.959
she's currently missing.

17:04.916 --> 17:05.750
- Who, do you know?

17:05.834 --> 17:07.583
- No, I don't know.

17:11.165 --> 17:12.250
- Did you check the house?

17:12.333 --> 17:13.750
She's a smart girl.

17:13.834 --> 17:16.290
She's probably hiding somewhere,
maybe at the neighbors'.

17:16.375 --> 17:19.250
- She's not in the house
or at the neighbors'.

17:19.333 --> 17:20.583
- You sure?

17:20.666 --> 17:21.916
You're telling me
no one saw her?

17:23.541 --> 17:24.375
I'll go check the house myself.

17:27.333 --> 17:29.959
- We think the perpetrator
might have taken her.

17:31.000 --> 17:32.208
- This happened last night.

17:34.250 --> 17:35.875
And you believe
she was kidnapped?

17:36.667 --> 17:39.208
My daughter is
missing, Detective.

17:40.375 --> 17:42.375
What is it you're doing
exactly to bring her back home?

17:42.458 --> 17:45.333
- We have a few leads, and we
have a search party out there

17:45.417 --> 17:46.000
looking for your daughter, sir.

17:46.083 --> 17:48.166
We released an AMBER alert,

17:48.250 --> 17:51.542
and we have plenty of
checkpoints out in that area.

17:51.625 --> 17:53.917
We're doing everything
that we can.

17:54.000 --> 17:55.208
Please let me do my job.

17:57.333 --> 18:00.458
Thank you for your
cooperation, Mr. Meisner.

18:02.333 --> 18:02.375
I'll be in touch.

18:09.375 --> 18:12.250
(suspenseful music)

18:17.417 --> 18:19.208
(Smith groaning)

19:05.458 --> 19:07.125
- They said I could get
back in later tonight

19:07.208 --> 19:10.417
but I don't see how I could
ever stay there again.

19:13.959 --> 19:14.834
- Hey, brother.

19:20.417 --> 19:23.458
I'm so sorry about
what happened.

19:23.542 --> 19:23.792
You too, Todd.

19:23.875 --> 19:25.542
- Thanks

19:25.625 --> 19:27.250
- You guys remember Harry?

19:27.333 --> 19:28.959
- Hey, sorry to hear
about everything.

19:29.041 --> 19:31.375
- We got about 19 guys.

19:31.458 --> 19:32.208
Some of them even saw
your posts on social media

19:32.291 --> 19:35.291
this morning and
they wanted to help.

19:35.375 --> 19:37.083
You heard from Smith yet?

19:37.166 --> 19:37.959
- No.

19:41.542 --> 19:43.375
- This is the latest
photograph of her.

19:45.333 --> 19:46.458
- [Fred] Hand these out.

19:46.542 --> 19:47.250
Make sure everyone gets one.

19:47.333 --> 19:48.166
- Got it.

19:49.291 --> 19:51.750
- All right, we have the
east and west sides covered.

19:51.834 --> 19:52.875
If you guys want to join us

19:52.959 --> 19:54.000
and do the north and south
sides, that would be best.

19:54.083 --> 19:54.917
Let me know if you need any help

19:55.000 --> 19:56.333
getting word out to the press.

19:56.417 --> 19:58.458
- Yeah, I've already
contacted a few outlets.

20:00.166 --> 20:02.250
- Thanks for making this happen.

20:02.333 --> 20:03.709
- Oh, don't mention it.

20:03.792 --> 20:05.500
It's no different than if
it was my own daughter.

20:07.000 --> 20:08.792
It's gonna be a long night, bro,

20:08.875 --> 20:10.333
but if she's out
here, we'll find her.

20:10.417 --> 20:12.458
You gotta have some hope and
take it one step at a time.

20:14.500 --> 20:15.542
- I'll take the south.

20:20.375 --> 20:23.166
(dramatic music)

20:26.125 --> 20:27.792
- So you were home last night?

20:32.500 --> 20:33.417
Take any medication?

20:37.208 --> 20:42.291
- Yeah, some, yeah.

20:51.083 --> 20:54.792
I've done some pretty
fucked up things before,

20:54.875 --> 20:59.583
but messing with kids?

20:59.667 --> 21:04.417
No, I mean, that's
something I would never do.

21:06.542 --> 21:08.125
- Who said anything about kids?

21:12.375 --> 21:13.500
- I, uh, (clears throat)

21:13.583 --> 21:17.000
I watch the news and your mug
is all over it, all right.

21:17.083 --> 21:18.500
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I really need to finish.

21:23.291 --> 21:26.000
Pretty sure you need
a warrant for that.

21:29.625 --> 21:32.917
- Two years as a narc
and already a detective.

21:33.959 --> 21:35.583
The department must
have ran out of pussy.

21:43.792 --> 21:47.291
- What the fuck is this, Casper?

21:47.375 --> 21:48.291
- My new hobby.

21:50.709 --> 21:53.417
- So what do you know about
the home invasion last night?

21:57.458 --> 22:00.041
Didn't hear anything
from your road dogs?

22:00.125 --> 22:00.709
- I'm clean.

22:00.792 --> 22:01.417
I don't fuck around no more.

22:03.291 --> 22:04.166
And if I knew
anything, I'd tell you.

22:04.250 --> 22:06.834
So don't come to my job, okay?

22:07.208 --> 22:08.417
That's it.

22:37.041 --> 22:39.583
- Can I help you?

22:39.667 --> 22:42.667
- I have a few questions about
an associate that works here.

22:42.750 --> 22:45.834
Perhaps I can speak to
Mr. Lewis, Mr. Ives?

22:47.375 --> 22:49.500
- Mr. Lewis doesn't
operate out of this office.

22:50.500 --> 22:53.250
- Where does he
operate out of then?

22:53.333 --> 22:54.500
- I'm afraid I don't know.

22:54.583 --> 22:56.500
They don't tell me that
kind of information.

22:57.542 --> 22:58.625
- What about Mr. Ives?

22:58.709 --> 23:00.166
Is he available?

23:00.250 --> 23:01.583
- [Receptionist] No, he
passed away years ago.

23:03.750 --> 23:04.583
- Who do you suggest
helps me then?

23:08.834 --> 23:09.750
- One moment, please.

23:16.875 --> 23:17.625
Understood, thank you.

23:20.041 --> 23:21.625
I'm sorry, there's no one
that can help you right now.

23:21.709 --> 23:22.917
- Maybe you can help me.

23:24.625 --> 23:28.625
Ross Meisner, he's an
associate that works here.

23:29.917 --> 23:31.125
You heard or seen anything

23:31.208 --> 23:32.583
out of the ordinary
lately with him?

23:34.750 --> 23:36.667
Any strange visitors
or anything?

23:36.750 --> 23:36.792
- Other than you?

23:38.500 --> 23:39.291
No.

23:44.125 --> 23:46.333
Is there anything else
I can help you with?

23:46.417 --> 23:46.625
- No, that'll be it.

23:48.417 --> 23:48.750
Have a good day.

23:51.792 --> 23:52.875
Fucking lawyers.

24:32.291 --> 24:34.041
(Todd sighing)

24:34.125 --> 24:37.250
(Dane sighing)

24:37.333 --> 24:40.291
- You sure you
wanna stay in here?

24:42.750 --> 24:43.625
- Yeah.

24:46.041 --> 24:47.125
- All right.

24:49.750 --> 24:51.709
I'll be at the hospital
if you need anything.

24:53.625 --> 24:54.667
Try and get some rest.

25:06.667 --> 25:09.083
(gentle music)

25:55.709 --> 25:57.750
(Dane screaming)

26:36.667 --> 26:39.250
(phone ringing)

26:42.166 --> 26:43.000
- Yeah.

26:49.667 --> 26:52.792
- Came across him
about 20 minutes ago.

26:52.875 --> 26:54.792
One of them had a confrontation
with one of the customers

26:54.875 --> 26:54.917
in the bar last night.

26:57.917 --> 26:59.500
- [Prostitute] Welcome
back, handsome.

26:59.583 --> 27:03.125
- Need you to tell
her what you told me.

27:03.208 --> 27:05.166
- There ain't much
to tell, baby.

27:05.250 --> 27:06.792
That little girl
that went missing,

27:07.959 --> 27:08.875
we know who did it.
- Mm-hmm.

27:10.750 --> 27:12.208
- And who would that be?

27:12.291 --> 27:14.500
- A pervert that was
sitting at the bar

27:14.583 --> 27:16.917
tried to rub up on
me in the alley,

27:17.000 --> 27:19.166
and then asked me if
I knew any youngins

27:19.250 --> 27:20.417
that he could fuck with.

27:21.458 --> 27:23.208
- I saw that sick fuck
going down the street

27:23.291 --> 27:25.125
up to those rich folks' houses.

27:25.208 --> 27:25.834
I mean, we ain't no
detective, but that's--

27:25.917 --> 27:26.959
- What happened to your hand?

27:29.125 --> 27:32.083
- Listen, he's a cradle
robbing pervert, okay?

27:32.166 --> 27:35.041
Y'all need to find him and
lock his ass in the cooler.

27:36.709 --> 27:38.041
- Do you have a description?

27:38.125 --> 27:41.166
- Yeah, African American male,
possibly 30s, black jacket.

27:42.875 --> 27:45.208
- (sighs) See if
anyone else around here

27:45.291 --> 27:46.458
can verify their story.

27:58.041 --> 27:58.458
You the owner?

27:58.542 --> 28:01.000
- Yeah, 22 years.

28:03.583 --> 28:05.500
You gonna get those
bimbos outta here?

28:05.583 --> 28:08.125
All that bustle is
hurting my business.

28:08.208 --> 28:09.792
- Apparently, they got into
a confrontation last night

28:09.875 --> 28:14.917
with one of your customers,
young, black, male.

28:15.000 --> 28:15.917
See what happened?

28:16.000 --> 28:19.083
- I would hardly call
that a confrontation.

28:19.166 --> 28:21.750
All the guy did was
give them his drinks.

28:21.834 --> 28:24.875
Truth of which by the way
he didn't even pay for.

28:24.959 --> 28:25.000
- So you know him?

28:27.000 --> 28:29.917
- Yeah, I know him,
but I ain't no snitch.

28:30.000 --> 28:33.625
Look, I don't wanna get the
guy jammed up with the law.

28:34.792 --> 28:36.792
- Withholding information--
- Take it easy.

28:36.875 --> 28:38.291
The guy's name is Smith.

28:38.375 --> 28:40.625
The poor bastard's deaf.

28:40.709 --> 28:42.834
He's been in here every night
drinking himself to death

28:42.917 --> 28:43.875
and running up quite a tab.

28:43.959 --> 28:46.834
That's why he's banned
from here forever.

28:48.083 --> 28:50.959
- So you didn't see anything
that happened in the alleyway?

28:51.041 --> 28:51.959
- No, that I did not.

28:54.041 --> 28:59.458
- Thank you.

28:59.458 --> 29:01.875
(somber music)

29:26.875 --> 29:28.667
- (scoffs) That ain't
gonna work, honey.

29:28.750 --> 29:30.083
No one pays the
bills around here.

29:43.792 --> 29:45.667
He owes me six months' rent.

29:45.750 --> 29:46.667
I had to give him
an eviction notice

29:46.750 --> 29:48.834
even though I hated to do that

29:48.917 --> 29:51.041
to someone who
served this country.

29:51.125 --> 29:53.875
We got three more
open units out back.

29:54.000 --> 29:55.917
I would hate to throw
all of his stuff out,

29:56.000 --> 29:58.083
but we did start
cleaning up a bit.

30:00.166 --> 30:03.959
He's gonna be shocked when he
gets back, if he gets back.

30:10.917 --> 30:14.959
- Have you even seen
anyone come around?

30:15.041 --> 30:15.959
Any relatives, any friends?

30:18.500 --> 30:19.333
- No.

30:20.959 --> 30:23.000
I never really thought that
he had any family or friends.

30:30.208 --> 30:31.041
He's a real loner.

31:03.709 --> 31:06.417
(dramatic music)

31:17.041 --> 31:17.875
- Stop!

31:57.083 --> 31:59.583
(upbeat music)

32:20.500 --> 32:23.000
Move, move, move!

32:24.041 --> 32:25.875
(gun firing)

32:25.959 --> 32:28.166
(people screaming)

32:28.250 --> 32:28.667
I know you can't hear me.

32:28.750 --> 32:32.083
(dramatic music)

32:34.125 --> 32:34.709
- I, I.

32:34.792 --> 32:36.375
- Can you read my lips?

32:36.458 --> 32:38.166
- I didn't do it.

32:38.250 --> 32:40.750
- Keep your hands
up, don't move.

32:40.834 --> 32:43.458
(Fini grunting)

33:02.625 --> 33:03.458
Hey!

33:16.250 --> 33:18.709
(Fini panting)

33:26.542 --> 33:28.166
How's the arm?

33:29.458 --> 33:32.083
- My arm is better than my legs.

33:32.166 --> 33:32.291
How's your face?

33:35.917 --> 33:37.125
- Don't let me interrupt.

33:39.917 --> 33:40.750
- Go on.

33:42.667 --> 33:44.375
- So, I left the bar.

33:46.250 --> 33:50.208
- Hey, get off me,
cradle-robbing pervert.

33:52.000 --> 33:53.083
Shit!

33:53.166 --> 33:55.250
- [Smith] But these bitches
followed me outside.

33:57.000 --> 33:58.291
- There he is, that sick fuck.

34:01.333 --> 34:02.583
- Hey, retard.

34:02.667 --> 34:04.458
Where you going, huh?

34:04.542 --> 34:05.709
You wanna explain

34:05.792 --> 34:06.250
what the hell you were
doing with my girl, huh?

34:10.750 --> 34:11.958
(Pimp grunting)

34:12.041 --> 34:13.166
- [Prostitute] You okay?

34:21.750 --> 34:25.041
(Prostitute yelping)

34:27.792 --> 34:29.458
(Smith screaming)

34:29.542 --> 34:32.667
(Prostitute groaning)

34:42.041 --> 34:42.708
- [Smith] I had no choice.

34:42.792 --> 34:45.583
I was just defending myself.

34:47.333 --> 34:50.166
- Is that when you went to
the Meisners' residence?

34:50.250 --> 34:53.000
- I didn't know where
else to go for help.

34:53.083 --> 34:56.291
Other than Dane, Todd has always
been someone I could trust.

35:12.917 --> 35:15.083
- (sighing) What the
hell are you doing here?

35:15.166 --> 35:16.208
- Is Todd here?

35:16.291 --> 35:17.583
- [Ross] He is.

35:17.667 --> 35:18.834
- Can I speak to him, please?

35:18.917 --> 35:21.041
I could use his help.

35:21.125 --> 35:22.750
- Are you joking?

35:22.834 --> 35:25.291
- Look, (clears throat)
I don't want any trouble.

35:28.083 --> 35:29.166
- I'll go get him.

35:36.750 --> 35:37.875
- I'm not buying it.

36:07.208 --> 36:09.917
- Running was not
a wise decision.

36:10.959 --> 36:13.375
- I've had my fair share
of trouble with the law,

36:13.458 --> 36:16.500
but didn't need to stick around
and get that third strike.

36:18.750 --> 36:20.542
Now, if that motherfucker didn't
call the cop, I wouldn't--

36:20.625 --> 36:21.917
- Well, he didn't.

36:22.542 --> 36:25.291
He's in a coma right now.

36:25.375 --> 36:27.291
What do you know about
the home invasion?

36:28.375 --> 36:30.667
Did you take the girl?

36:30.750 --> 36:34.125
- So what you're telling us
is that you weren't aware

36:34.208 --> 36:37.250
of the home invasion
and kidnapping

36:37.333 --> 36:39.083
when it was in progress
at the Meisners'?

36:39.166 --> 36:40.250
- We matched your blood
to the blood at the house.

36:40.333 --> 36:43.166
We have a search party
at your apartment.

36:43.250 --> 36:46.000
You might as well
start coming clean.

36:46.083 --> 36:47.375
- What'd you say?

36:47.458 --> 36:51.041
- Your friend's
daughter, she's missing.

36:54.709 --> 36:58.000
You wouldn't happen to know
where she is, would you?

37:02.083 --> 37:04.333
- Oh, I get it.

37:04.417 --> 37:06.291
I see what's happening here.

37:07.834 --> 37:09.834
Good cop and bad cop bullshit.

37:09.917 --> 37:11.083
How dare you?

37:11.166 --> 37:13.583
How fucking dare
you asking me that?

37:17.625 --> 37:18.625
Get a lawyer in here!

37:24.583 --> 37:26.041
- On the night of the crime,

37:26.125 --> 37:29.125
did you happen to see or
speak to Mr. Whitaker?

37:29.208 --> 37:30.375
- Why would that matter?

37:31.333 --> 37:34.166
- Because the blood
we found at your place

37:34.250 --> 37:36.208
is the same type
as Mr. Whitaker's.

37:37.250 --> 37:39.333
We're still testing to see
if it's an exact match,

37:39.417 --> 37:40.542
but I think it will be.

37:44.083 --> 37:49.291
Mr. Hunte, please have a seat.

37:49.375 --> 37:50.667
- I'm good.

37:50.750 --> 37:54.291
You got someone?

37:54.291 --> 37:56.208
- Mr. Smith Whitaker was
brought in for questioning.

37:56.291 --> 37:59.250
I understand he's
a friend of yours.

37:59.333 --> 38:01.458
- Yeah, he's my
daughter's godfather.

38:01.542 --> 38:03.250
- I'm aware of that.

38:03.333 --> 38:04.709
That's why I wanted
to tell you personally

38:04.792 --> 38:06.333
before the news breaks out.

38:06.417 --> 38:07.667
- Did you talk to Smith?

38:07.750 --> 38:10.166
Does he know anything
about Eden's whereabouts?

38:10.250 --> 38:13.125
- We're still trying
to figure that out.

38:14.959 --> 38:17.166
Unfortunately, at this moment,

38:17.250 --> 38:19.125
I cannot give you
any more information.

38:20.125 --> 38:22.458
- Mr. Meisner, are
there any recent events

38:22.542 --> 38:24.166
that you can think of

38:24.250 --> 38:26.709
that would cause Smith to
harm you or your family?

38:26.792 --> 38:30.875
- Smith and Ross had a minor
argument on New Year's Eve.

38:30.959 --> 38:32.583
He was drunk.

38:33.500 --> 38:34.792
It was nothing.

38:34.875 --> 38:36.083
Smith is family.

38:38.125 --> 38:38.959
- I read somewhere that half
the kids gone missing like this

38:39.041 --> 38:39.709
aren't found alive.

38:39.792 --> 38:42.000
Is that true?

38:42.083 --> 38:43.917
- There's certainly lots
of statistics out there

38:44.000 --> 38:46.375
that would indicate so, but--

38:46.458 --> 38:48.041
- And if the kidnapper
isn't found by day one,

38:48.125 --> 38:50.667
chances of solving
go down to about 10%.

38:52.834 --> 38:57.709
- I assure you that Detective
Fini here and our team

38:57.792 --> 38:59.542
is working around the clock
to find your daughter.

39:01.041 --> 39:02.667
- Doing what?

39:03.917 --> 39:05.500
Investigating my
innocent best friend

39:05.583 --> 39:07.583
while my while my
daughter's still out there

39:07.667 --> 39:10.917
waiting for her father
to bring her back home?

39:13.834 --> 39:15.583
- We're gonna find Eden.

39:18.333 --> 39:20.125
- 36 hours and counting.

39:23.208 --> 39:26.083
(door slams shut)

39:26.542 --> 39:29.542
(dramatic music)

42:14.875 --> 42:16.375
- Oorah, brother.

42:17.667 --> 42:19.333
Damn, it's good to see you.
- Yeah, same to you.

42:19.417 --> 42:20.959
- Hanging on?
- Yeah.

42:35.917 --> 42:37.959
- Everything you
asked for right here.

42:40.291 --> 42:41.375
It's all clean too.

42:44.583 --> 42:46.458
What do you plan to
do with all these?

42:48.709 --> 42:50.208
- You can never be too careful.

42:51.542 --> 42:53.250
- Hey, I have my guys
put word on the street

42:53.333 --> 42:55.625
about your daughter.

42:55.709 --> 42:57.625
If I hear anything, I'll
keep you posted, all right?

42:58.834 --> 42:59.834
- Thanks for looking out, Jay.

43:26.625 --> 43:28.750
(keyboard clicking)

43:32.625 --> 43:33.667
(laptop beeping)

43:33.750 --> 43:34.542
- Oh, fuck.

43:34.625 --> 43:37.834
Are you fucking
kidding me? (sighing)

43:42.709 --> 43:44.000
Bullshit.

43:44.083 --> 43:45.750
(dramatic music)

43:48.208 --> 43:49.792
Fuck.

44:01.792 --> 44:03.709
Don't you come any closer.

44:03.792 --> 44:04.333
You hear me?

44:04.417 --> 44:05.750
I'll fucking shank you.

44:09.750 --> 44:09.875
Stay back.

44:15.875 --> 44:17.125
The fuck are you?

44:17.667 --> 44:19.834
Come here, come here!

44:22.500 --> 44:23.750
Oh, fuck, fuck!

44:25.834 --> 44:29.750
What do you want,
man, what do you want?

44:32.291 --> 44:33.750
- Where is she?

44:33.834 --> 44:34.542
- I don't know who she is, man.

44:34.625 --> 44:37.083
I don't mess with any kids.

44:37.166 --> 44:39.333
I already told you guys.

44:39.417 --> 44:40.917
- Told who?

44:41.000 --> 44:42.250
- What, you ain't a cop?

44:47.208 --> 44:47.917
Those aren't mine, man.

44:48.000 --> 44:49.875
I don't know where
those came from.

44:49.959 --> 44:51.709
- What is this for?
- I don't fucking know.

44:53.709 --> 44:55.583
- Tell me where she is.
- I don't know.

44:55.667 --> 44:58.792
- Then you'll fucking die
tonight, you worthless junkie!

44:58.875 --> 45:01.000
- I don't know what else
to tell you, if I did,

45:01.083 --> 45:01.917
I don't know shit.

45:02.875 --> 45:04.500
Please, man, please

45:04.583 --> 45:05.917
- That's unfortunate.

45:06.000 --> 45:10.875
- No, ah, fuck! (crying)

45:11.917 --> 45:13.291
- Hey, you see this?

45:13.375 --> 45:14.333
Huh?
- Okay, okay, okay, okay!

45:14.417 --> 45:16.625
I'll tell you. I'll tell
you, put the knife down.

45:16.709 --> 45:17.625
Put the knife down.

45:17.709 --> 45:19.000
Please, god, just
stop, stop, stop!

45:19.083 --> 45:20.250
I'll tell you where she is!

45:20.333 --> 45:21.625
I'll tell you where
she is, please!

45:21.709 --> 45:22.750
- [Dane] The next one
won't be your finger.

45:22.834 --> 45:23.625
- I'll tell you, man.

45:23.709 --> 45:24.625
Please, please, put it down.

45:24.709 --> 45:26.291
- The girl.
- I'll tell you.

45:26.375 --> 45:27.917
I'll tell you, put
the knife down.

45:28.000 --> 45:29.625
Okay, stop, stop, stop!

45:29.709 --> 45:30.625
Please, I'll tell you!

45:30.709 --> 45:32.041
I'll fucking take you right now!

45:32.125 --> 45:33.917
I'll fucking take you,
bro, I'll take you, please!

45:42.959 --> 45:44.250
Where's your daughter, huh?

45:45.667 --> 45:46.500
Where is she?

45:48.583 --> 45:49.583
- How much further?

45:50.417 --> 45:51.625
- [Jim] I don't even know

45:51.709 --> 45:54.542
what your girl looks
like, all right?

45:55.750 --> 45:58.750
Just keep going
down a little more.

45:58.834 --> 46:01.500
I think it's about
1/4 mile up the road.

46:04.750 --> 46:05.000
- You better be right.

46:12.208 --> 46:13.250
Is that the one there?

46:15.417 --> 46:17.166
- Yeah, that's the one.

46:35.625 --> 46:37.000
Just let me go, please?

46:37.834 --> 46:38.917
I told you everything.

46:39.583 --> 46:42.041
- She's in there?

46:42.125 --> 46:44.959
Are you sure?

46:44.959 --> 46:45.917
- Yeah, man.

46:46.000 --> 46:47.875
Please untie me, please?

46:47.959 --> 46:48.000
- Who else is in there?

46:49.959 --> 46:51.166
- I don't know man.

46:51.250 --> 46:54.000
Look, I only drop off some
speed here, all right?

46:54.083 --> 46:56.000
I got nothing to do
with the girl, man.

46:57.500 --> 46:58.333
I swear.

46:59.917 --> 47:01.583
I fucking, I never touched
her man, I never touched her.

47:01.667 --> 47:04.667
Just let me go, please?

47:04.750 --> 47:05.709
What are you doing, man?

47:05.792 --> 47:07.834
- Sit tight.
- What are you doing?

47:07.917 --> 47:08.542
- [Dane] You're
not going anywhere.

47:08.625 --> 47:11.792
- Please don't. (crying)

47:11.875 --> 47:13.041
Come on, man.

47:13.125 --> 47:14.375
Come on, man.

47:14.458 --> 47:15.041
I told you everything
I know, man, come on.

47:17.125 --> 47:19.125
Let me go, let me go.

47:19.208 --> 47:19.250
Let me go.

47:41.875 --> 47:44.000
(crow cawing)

47:44.083 --> 47:47.125
(speaking in foreign language)

47:51.333 --> 47:52.000
- [Man] Over here!

47:58.542 --> 47:59.959
- [Eden] Daddy?

48:03.083 --> 48:03.208
Daddy?

48:11.208 --> 48:13.125
I still love you, Daddy.

48:20.291 --> 48:22.041
(dramatic music)

49:35.000 --> 49:37.125
(gun firing)

49:41.333 --> 49:41.375
- Come out.

49:43.291 --> 49:44.458
Come out, man!

49:46.834 --> 49:47.750
Come on in.

49:51.041 --> 49:54.875
Come on, show
yourself. (laughing)

49:54.959 --> 49:58.500
Come on, show.
(gun firing)

49:58.583 --> 50:00.041
(Willy laughing)
(gun firing)

50:00.125 --> 50:02.542
(Willy groaning)

50:02.625 --> 50:03.125
I've been shot.

50:10.333 --> 50:11.166
- Is she here?

50:11.792 --> 50:15.166
(Willy laughing)

50:15.250 --> 50:16.750
(Willy groaning)

50:16.834 --> 50:18.959
- She screamed real hard.

50:19.041 --> 50:21.000
Oh, you're too late, man.

50:21.083 --> 50:22.083
She's fucking dead.

50:22.166 --> 50:23.417
You're too late!

50:23.917 --> 50:27.250
(Willy screaming)

50:27.333 --> 50:27.959
(gun firing)

50:28.041 --> 50:30.625
(Willy gasping)

50:48.709 --> 50:51.500
(woman screaming)

51:08.375 --> 51:09.792
- [Woman] Hello?

51:13.709 --> 51:16.834
(knocking on walls)

51:19.709 --> 51:22.208
(gun firing)

51:29.750 --> 51:30.542
- Are you alone?

51:32.458 --> 51:32.500
Don't be afraid.

51:34.417 --> 51:35.458
I'ma get you out of here.

51:36.917 --> 51:37.750
Take my hand.

51:39.792 --> 51:40.917
I'll take you out.

51:41.000 --> 51:46.917
Oh shit, get down, get down.

51:53.041 --> 51:53.667
Stay here and stay down.

51:53.750 --> 51:56.375
(dramatic music)

52:25.375 --> 52:26.375
- [Willy] What, what?

52:26.458 --> 52:27.417
- He's behind us.
- Ah!

52:27.500 --> 52:28.667
- Look, man, look.

52:28.750 --> 52:29.834
Fucking car's right behind us.
- All right.

52:29.917 --> 52:34.083
- How did he fucking get here
so fast? (Willy grunting)

52:38.125 --> 52:39.000
Come on, come on, he's getting
closer. (Willy grunting)

52:39.083 --> 52:42.375
He's getting closer,
man, come on.

52:42.458 --> 52:43.083
He's getting closer.

52:43.166 --> 52:45.041
Get out, get your ass out there.

52:45.125 --> 52:47.208
Shoot him, Willy.
- I got him.

52:47.291 --> 52:48.709
- Shoot him.
- I got him.

52:48.792 --> 52:51.333
(gun firing)

52:51.417 --> 52:52.250
- Yeah.

52:52.959 --> 52:54.875
Hit him again, hit him again.

52:54.959 --> 52:55.750
Hit him again, Willy.

52:55.834 --> 52:57.375
- I'm working on it.

52:58.834 --> 53:00.375
(guns firing)

53:08.083 --> 53:09.375
He's still coming!

53:09.458 --> 53:10.542
- Come on, we're running
out of real estate, Willy.

53:10.625 --> 53:11.375
- Hurry up, hurry up!

53:14.333 --> 53:15.750
- Go for the front tires.
- Fuck you!

53:15.834 --> 53:17.875
- Go for the front tires.

53:31.375 --> 53:32.709
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
- What?

53:32.792 --> 53:34.417
- We lost him, we lost him,
we lost him! Get back in.

53:43.792 --> 53:44.458
You all right, yeah?

53:44.542 --> 53:46.625
(Willy groaning)

53:46.709 --> 53:50.208
Get some Band-Aids for that.
- Band-Aids.

54:11.458 --> 54:15.333
- Fucking asshole, let's
get the fuck out of here.

54:15.417 --> 54:15.500
Yeah.

54:22.834 --> 54:23.834
- Ah, fuck!

54:27.125 --> 54:31.792
(speech drowned out by music)

54:43.917 --> 54:46.417
(somber music)

55:04.208 --> 55:05.500
- Where's my daughter?

55:07.333 --> 55:07.500
Where is she?

56:47.542 --> 56:50.208
(dramatic music)

57:10.041 --> 57:13.041
(baby Eden crying)

57:34.750 --> 57:37.417
(Zoe gasping)

57:40.709 --> 57:43.500
(gentle music)

59:09.166 --> 59:12.041
(monitor beeping)

59:29.709 --> 59:32.166
- The mystery man survived
a violent shootout.

59:32.250 --> 59:34.834
The kidnappers of
Viola Anderson, an
innocent 14-year-old

59:34.917 --> 59:37.917
who was kidnapped in the
neighborhood of Mammoth Park

59:38.000 --> 59:40.458
last November while
walking her dog.

59:41.709 --> 59:44.291
The confrontation ended a
few miles away from this home

59:44.375 --> 59:45.542
down the street in a car wreck.

59:45.625 --> 59:48.750
Two suspects were
killed in the crash.

59:48.834 --> 59:50.875
As Rosemead investigators
continue their search

59:50.959 --> 59:55.625
for this mystery man, the
locals and the girl's family

59:55.709 --> 59:58.250
are now starting to
call him a true hero.

59:58.750 --> 59:59.834
- One of the suspects in
this case was Jim Tomanak.

01:00:01.500 --> 01:00:02.750
I just wanted you to know.

01:00:07.417 --> 01:00:09.041
- At least that
girl's home tonight.

01:00:10.083 --> 01:00:15.041
(Fini sighing)
(solemn music)

01:00:15.917 --> 01:00:18.792
- Can I please go home? (crying)

01:00:21.250 --> 01:00:22.625
- Fini, Fini.

01:00:24.583 --> 01:00:25.792
She changed her tune.

01:00:25.875 --> 01:00:29.500
Her friend admitted
to stabbing Smith.

01:00:31.542 --> 01:00:32.917
Just thought you'd wanna know.

01:00:39.208 --> 01:00:41.291
Get some rest.

01:00:56.792 --> 01:00:58.041
- Hey.

01:00:58.125 --> 01:01:02.458
Hey, good morning, sunshine.

01:01:02.542 --> 01:01:04.709
Oh, oh yeah.

01:01:04.792 --> 01:01:06.667
Oh, it's so good
to see those eyes.

01:01:06.750 --> 01:01:09.250
Hi, hello, nurse!

01:01:09.333 --> 01:01:14.083
Hello, oh.

01:01:14.166 --> 01:01:19.125
(Fini grunting)
(somber music)

01:01:30.417 --> 01:01:33.792
(phone ringing)

01:01:44.834 --> 01:01:45.875
- [Todd] You're inside.

01:01:45.959 --> 01:01:47.709
- It's okay Mr. Meisner.

01:01:47.792 --> 01:01:48.208
It's okay.

01:01:48.291 --> 01:01:50.709
Just try to relax.

01:01:50.792 --> 01:01:53.291
Okay, squeeze my fingers, okay?

01:01:53.375 --> 01:01:54.542
Just keep squeezing, good.

01:01:54.625 --> 01:01:56.750
You're doing good, good job.

01:01:56.834 --> 01:01:57.792
- Todd.

01:01:57.875 --> 01:01:58.792
- Yeah.

01:01:58.875 --> 01:01:59.417
Hey.

01:01:59.500 --> 01:02:01.625
- Thanks for calling me.

01:02:02.667 --> 01:02:04.583
I need to ask him some
questions right away.

01:02:04.667 --> 01:02:05.875
How long until I'm able to?

01:02:05.959 --> 01:02:07.041
- It'll take him
some time to recover.

01:02:09.041 --> 01:02:10.542
From what we're seeing
so far this morning,

01:02:10.625 --> 01:02:12.333
he's been showing signs
of rapid progress.

01:02:12.417 --> 01:02:13.542
- [Todd] Right here,
I'm right here.

01:02:13.625 --> 01:02:14.375
- Where are they?

01:02:14.458 --> 01:02:16.625
Where are they?

01:02:16.709 --> 01:02:17.792
Eden?

01:02:18.458 --> 01:02:19.291
Eden?

01:02:20.208 --> 01:02:22.458
They came in, they were inside.

01:02:22.542 --> 01:02:22.959
They were inside.

01:02:41.166 --> 01:02:44.166
- They're trying to pin
some shit on me, bro.

01:02:46.542 --> 01:02:47.750
Not a big deal.

01:02:49.834 --> 01:02:51.542
I've dealt with worse.

01:02:51.625 --> 01:02:55.166
- Hey, that's not gonna happen.

01:02:55.250 --> 01:02:56.166
Ross is out of a coma.

01:02:56.250 --> 01:02:56.875
He's recovering.

01:02:56.959 --> 01:02:58.542
He'll vouch for you.

01:02:58.625 --> 01:02:59.000
- That was never supposed
to be like this, bro.

01:03:01.583 --> 01:03:05.667
Ever since we got back,
things haven't been the same.

01:03:07.875 --> 01:03:12.500
I know I have gone
overboard with the drinking

01:03:12.583 --> 01:03:17.625
and haven't been myself,
but people around here,

01:03:18.750 --> 01:03:20.792
treating me like I'm
a fucking retard.

01:03:20.875 --> 01:03:21.000
- I'm sorry.

01:03:21.917 --> 01:03:23.875
I know I haven't
been around for you

01:03:23.959 --> 01:03:25.667
as much as I wanted to be.

01:03:25.750 --> 01:03:27.208
- Nah, bro.

01:03:27.291 --> 01:03:30.583
You've been supporting
your family.

01:03:32.959 --> 01:03:33.792
I'm sorry.

01:03:36.792 --> 01:03:41.875
I'm sorry I wasn't there to
protect her when you couldn't.

01:03:43.959 --> 01:03:44.875
I failed you.

01:03:47.041 --> 01:03:48.166
I failed Eden.

01:03:50.834 --> 01:03:52.583
I've been trying, though.

01:03:52.667 --> 01:03:53.625
I really have.

01:03:53.709 --> 01:03:55.125
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

01:03:57.208 --> 01:04:01.291
- Civilian life has no
meaning to me anymore.

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:05.041
I'm better off in here.

01:04:07.750 --> 01:04:08.625
- Listen to me.

01:04:11.500 --> 01:04:12.375
Listen to me.

01:04:13.834 --> 01:04:15.208
I'm going to find Eden

01:04:16.667 --> 01:04:18.917
and then we're gonna
get you out of here.

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:19.875
You have my word.

01:04:20.917 --> 01:04:22.000
- It's all good, bro.

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:33.834
(Smith sniffling)

01:04:34.875 --> 01:04:37.000
(people chattering)

01:04:43.041 --> 01:04:44.291
- You okay, Detective?

01:04:47.959 --> 01:04:48.083
Careful, it's hot.

01:04:49.750 --> 01:04:51.625
- Oh, I only ordered one.

01:04:51.709 --> 01:04:54.166
- It's my lunch time too.

01:04:54.250 --> 01:04:56.000
- Oh. (chuckling)

01:04:56.083 --> 01:04:58.542
- And you look like you
could use some company.

01:05:00.709 --> 01:05:01.500
- Thank you.

01:05:02.583 --> 01:05:04.000
- Plus, I'd also like to
get to know my best tipper.

01:05:10.709 --> 01:05:13.041
- (laughing) That's a cute kid.

01:05:15.875 --> 01:05:17.625
- Do you have any
kids, Detective?

01:05:18.500 --> 01:05:21.500
- Um, Fini, please.

01:05:21.583 --> 01:05:23.917
No, I do not.

01:05:24.583 --> 01:05:25.458
- Neither do I.

01:05:26.583 --> 01:05:28.500
But if I did,

01:05:28.583 --> 01:05:31.750
I sure as hell wouldn't let
them be glued to crap like that.

01:05:31.834 --> 01:05:33.834
I mean, when I was kid we
used to go play outside

01:05:33.917 --> 01:05:37.959
with friends, no such
electronics to get glued to.

01:05:38.917 --> 01:05:41.000
Didn't you?
(dramatic music)

01:05:41.083 --> 01:05:41.917
It's crazy.

01:05:43.583 --> 01:05:45.792
- Oh, shit.
- What?

01:05:48.792 --> 01:05:50.500
- Thank you so
much for the soup.

01:06:19.417 --> 01:06:20.250
Mr. Hunte.

01:06:26.166 --> 01:06:27.333
- What's this?

01:06:27.417 --> 01:06:28.667
- Your daughter had
a tablet she used.

01:06:28.750 --> 01:06:30.875
Do you have access to that?

01:06:30.959 --> 01:06:32.000
- Yeah, we'd watch
cartoons on it together.

01:06:32.083 --> 01:06:33.041
I gave it to her
for her birthday.

01:06:33.125 --> 01:06:36.333
- Do you happen to know
the login information?

01:06:37.875 --> 01:06:38.917
- Yeah, I think so.

01:06:50.917 --> 01:06:52.083
- [Tanke] You got something?

01:06:52.166 --> 01:06:53.709
- Yeah, email and
password to the cloud

01:06:53.792 --> 01:06:54.709
connected to Eden's tablet.

01:06:54.792 --> 01:06:55.917
- [Tanke] What tablet?

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:58.333
We never got a tablet
from the house.

01:06:58.417 --> 01:06:58.458
- Exactly.

01:07:00.041 --> 01:07:01.750
- What does that mean?

01:07:01.834 --> 01:07:04.250
- It was connected to a
WiFi internet signal there.

01:07:04.333 --> 01:07:08.625
Gray dot means the device
went offline at that location.

01:07:08.709 --> 01:07:10.625
- Looks like that's
right at Meisners'.

01:07:10.709 --> 01:07:11.542
- Yeah.

01:07:11.625 --> 01:07:13.750
I'm pretty sure while
it's in lock mode,

01:07:13.834 --> 01:07:15.166
the device can still
keep track of itself

01:07:15.250 --> 01:07:16.125
for at least 24 hours or so.

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:20.000
But in order for
us to locate it,

01:07:21.250 --> 01:07:24.834
it needs to be on and connected
to a WiFi signal again.

01:07:26.792 --> 01:07:27.667
- Oh, shit.

01:07:29.125 --> 01:07:29.959
Green dot.

01:07:30.917 --> 01:07:32.166
- It's on and connected.

01:07:33.917 --> 01:07:36.083
- Who could that be though?

01:07:38.834 --> 01:07:40.583
- 1805 Coldwater Canyon Road.

01:07:53.542 --> 01:07:55.125
Hands up.

01:07:55.208 --> 01:07:55.250
Keep your hands up.

01:07:56.500 --> 01:07:57.291
Sit.

01:08:00.750 --> 01:08:03.083
- It's clear.

01:08:03.166 --> 01:08:04.041
Relax, kid.

01:08:04.125 --> 01:08:05.291
Put your hands down.

01:08:05.375 --> 01:08:06.333
- Have you seen a
tablet around here?

01:08:10.166 --> 01:08:11.041
- Bottom drawer.

01:08:13.250 --> 01:08:14.333
This is my dad's place.

01:08:14.417 --> 01:08:16.250
I'm just kinda
hanging out right now.

01:08:21.582 --> 01:08:21.917
- Where did you get that?

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:22.792
- I found it.

01:08:22.875 --> 01:08:25.166
I didn't steal it, I swear.

01:08:25.250 --> 01:08:29.542
It just came off of our
B84 truck a few days ago.

01:08:29.625 --> 01:08:31.667
My buddy's gonna fix
the screen for me.

01:08:31.750 --> 01:08:32.582
- B84 truck?

01:08:33.750 --> 01:08:35.750
- Yeah, the trash truck.

01:08:35.834 --> 01:08:38.166
- It's very important you
tell us where you got that.

01:08:38.250 --> 01:08:41.625
Can you give us the
exact route of the B84?

01:08:42.082 --> 01:08:43.667
- Sure, yeah.

01:10:08.125 --> 01:10:09.500
- [Officer] Clear!

01:10:13.208 --> 01:10:14.542
- [Officer] Clear.

01:10:15.875 --> 01:10:17.500
- [Officer] Clear.

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:22.375
- [Officer] Clear.

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:47.375
- [Tanke] All clear, sir.

01:10:47.458 --> 01:10:49.333
- [Captain] Okay, secure
the entire perimeter.

01:10:49.417 --> 01:10:50.667
- [Tanke] Yeah.

01:10:59.041 --> 01:11:01.166
- So, what do you think?

01:11:01.750 --> 01:11:03.709
- We're late.

01:11:05.166 --> 01:11:06.291
- Yeah.

01:11:08.166 --> 01:11:10.250
Forensics on their way.

01:11:28.083 --> 01:11:29.834
- We're fucking late.

01:11:57.709 --> 01:11:58.500
Tanke.

01:12:00.583 --> 01:12:01.625
Grab that, grab that.

01:12:04.458 --> 01:12:16.834
Open it.

01:12:16.834 --> 01:12:18.500
(Fini grunting)

01:12:26.667 --> 01:12:27.500
Hey.

01:12:35.500 --> 01:12:38.375
(siren wailing)

01:12:43.834 --> 01:12:45.083
- [Eden] Daddy!

01:13:51.291 --> 01:13:52.083
- Babe.

01:13:53.542 --> 01:13:56.041
- Well, I'm a nice guy, right?

01:13:56.125 --> 01:13:57.208
- Yeah, yeah, you are.

01:13:57.291 --> 01:13:59.917
- Plus, if I didn't do anything
you'd give me shit, so.

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:01.500
- That's very true.

01:14:02.667 --> 01:14:04.000
- Hey.

01:14:04.083 --> 01:14:06.166
(sighing) Welcome home, buddy.
- Thanks.

01:14:09.875 --> 01:14:10.542
- Okay, that's a
long enough hug.

01:14:12.834 --> 01:14:13.542
- You look good.
- Thank you.

01:14:15.417 --> 01:14:17.333
So, is Eden here?

01:14:17.417 --> 01:14:18.000
- Yeah, upstairs napping.

01:14:18.083 --> 01:14:19.834
Food's ready, though.

01:14:19.917 --> 01:14:22.041
- Okay, can I wake her?

01:14:22.125 --> 01:14:23.375
- [Dane] Go for it.

01:14:23.458 --> 01:14:24.291
- All right, thanks.

01:14:24.375 --> 01:14:25.250
Thank you.
- Yeah.

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:02.542
(phone chiming)

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:04.667
Ross?

01:15:07.875 --> 01:15:08.709
Ross?

01:15:11.208 --> 01:15:13.208
Whose phone is that?

01:15:14.417 --> 01:15:17.417
- Guys, food's
about to get soggy.

01:15:17.500 --> 01:15:19.792
- Hey, whose phone is this?

01:15:24.417 --> 01:15:25.458
What?

01:15:25.542 --> 01:15:27.000
What are these threats?

01:15:31.417 --> 01:15:32.750
- What the hell am I reading?

01:15:39.625 --> 01:15:40.458
- The firm,

01:15:43.750 --> 01:15:44.667
they gave me anything
that I wanted.

01:15:46.625 --> 01:15:51.208
The house, the cars, for free.

01:15:51.291 --> 01:15:53.667
- Yeah, bonuses.
- No, they weren't bonuses.

01:15:54.834 --> 01:15:55.709
I thought that that's
what they were,

01:15:55.792 --> 01:15:57.291
but that's not what they were.

01:15:59.709 --> 01:16:02.375
They had me bill
clients outrageous fees

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:04.583
until I paid them back.

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:07.125
But it wasn't enough.

01:16:09.542 --> 01:16:14.458
I uncovered dirt about the firm,
money laundering and fraud.

01:16:15.667 --> 01:16:19.500
I threatened to talk, and that's
when the harassment began.

01:16:19.583 --> 01:16:21.709
(suspenseful music)

01:16:29.417 --> 01:16:30.208
I'll go get him.

01:16:38.792 --> 01:16:41.083
- Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:16:41.959 --> 01:16:43.750
(Eden screaming)

01:17:13.458 --> 01:17:15.375
- Get out of my house!

01:17:32.458 --> 01:17:33.792
(Ross groaning)

01:17:33.875 --> 01:17:33.917
Oh, my god!

01:17:38.834 --> 01:17:41.041
- [Kidnapper] Mr. Lewis would
like you to get back to him.

01:17:41.125 --> 01:17:46.166
Make your payments and keep
your motherfucking mouth shut.

01:17:46.667 --> 01:17:47.959
(Eden screaming)

01:17:48.041 --> 01:17:50.417
Fuck!

01:17:50.500 --> 01:17:52.709
Just bring her, come on.

01:18:05.667 --> 01:18:07.291
(Eden screaming)

01:18:07.375 --> 01:18:07.750
- Shh!

01:18:07.834 --> 01:18:09.750
I've got her!

01:18:09.834 --> 01:18:11.834
(Eden screaming)

01:18:35.417 --> 01:18:38.041
(phone ringing)

01:18:40.500 --> 01:18:43.000
- Hey, hey, we got a problem.

01:18:44.250 --> 01:18:45.834
- You were supposed to
only shake him down.

01:18:45.917 --> 01:18:48.500
You know he's in a
fucking coma right now.

01:18:48.583 --> 01:18:51.417
- Well, he shot at us.

01:18:51.500 --> 01:18:52.125
Look, things got wild.

01:18:52.208 --> 01:18:54.834
I had to do what I had to do.

01:18:54.917 --> 01:18:57.667
Plus, I'm sorry boss,
but we had a witness.

01:18:57.750 --> 01:18:57.917
- What witness?

01:19:01.125 --> 01:19:03.250
- [Kidnapper] Their little girl.

01:19:03.333 --> 01:19:05.959
- (scoffs) What are you
saying, you fucking idiot?

01:19:06.041 --> 01:19:08.291
They don't have a little girl.

01:19:08.375 --> 01:19:09.208
- Fuck.

01:19:09.875 --> 01:19:11.250
- [Lewis] Where is she now?

01:19:11.333 --> 01:19:12.458
- We have her here.

01:19:13.917 --> 01:19:16.625
What do you want me
to do with her, sir?

01:19:16.709 --> 01:19:17.458
- I don't know.

01:19:17.542 --> 01:19:17.875
That wasn't part of the plan.

01:19:19.917 --> 01:19:22.333
- Well, we could just
seal her off in here.

01:19:22.417 --> 01:19:24.166
- Yeah.

01:19:24.250 --> 01:19:25.291
Yeah, do that for now.

01:19:26.709 --> 01:19:28.542
Let me figure out a
way to get rid of her.

01:19:28.625 --> 01:19:30.542
And don't call me anymore.

01:19:33.417 --> 01:19:35.041
- I'm sorry.

01:19:38.250 --> 01:19:41.250
I had no idea that they
were gonna take it this far.

01:19:43.041 --> 01:19:44.333
Eden, she's my...

01:19:44.959 --> 01:19:47.458
- What were you thinking?

01:19:47.542 --> 01:19:50.458
- I promise that I will do
whatever it takes to fix this.

01:19:50.542 --> 01:19:51.083
- My daughter was kidnapped

01:19:53.083 --> 01:19:54.875
and held in a fucking
warehouse for days.

01:19:57.291 --> 01:20:01.208
My innocent, seven-year-old
daughter, from your house.

01:20:06.875 --> 01:20:08.583
You've done enough.

01:20:08.667 --> 01:20:09.041
I'll take it from here.

01:20:19.875 --> 01:20:22.875
(dramatic music)

01:21:02.375 --> 01:21:05.917
- [Bodyguard] We
got two bikes here.

01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:07.417
- Hey, Raz, keep an eye on
those two bikes in the back.

01:21:07.500 --> 01:21:09.083
- [Driver] The fuck?

01:21:23.583 --> 01:21:25.166
- [Bodyguard] Hey, why didn't
you make the turn, huh?

01:21:25.250 --> 01:21:26.083
Hey!

01:21:27.875 --> 01:21:28.458
Hey!

01:21:28.542 --> 01:21:30.709
I'm sorry, Mr. Lewis.

01:21:30.792 --> 01:21:33.083
(Lewis sighing)

01:21:33.166 --> 01:21:34.583
- I got a couple of
maggots rolling up on us.

01:21:34.667 --> 01:21:36.750
- All right, here we go.

01:21:36.834 --> 01:21:37.792
Here we go.

01:21:37.875 --> 01:21:38.625
- Lock and load.

01:21:38.709 --> 01:21:39.750
Take care of it.
- Got it.

01:21:39.834 --> 01:21:42.667
There's one on your left.

01:21:42.750 --> 01:21:45.709
There's another
one coming around!

01:21:56.166 --> 01:21:58.709
- We got two more back there.

01:22:02.792 --> 01:22:04.625
- What do I pay you guys for?

01:22:05.792 --> 01:22:07.458
What the fuck is
going on here, man?

01:22:07.542 --> 01:22:08.625
- [Driver] Coming from behind!

01:22:08.709 --> 01:22:10.458
- Come on, way to go.

01:22:25.208 --> 01:22:26.166
I'm out.

01:22:26.250 --> 01:22:28.125
I'm out.
- Son of a bitch.

01:22:28.208 --> 01:22:28.709
- [Driver] Hey, man,
I'm gonna speed up.

01:22:28.792 --> 01:22:31.375
- [Kidnapper] Hang on.

01:22:45.458 --> 01:22:46.208
Fuck!

01:22:48.917 --> 01:22:50.542
- Yeah, they got us!

01:22:57.458 --> 01:22:59.375
- [Kidnapper] Joe,
get the wheel!

01:22:59.458 --> 01:23:00.583
Get the wheel!

01:23:14.709 --> 01:23:18.208
(Lewis scoffs)

01:23:18.291 --> 01:23:20.208
(Lewis sighing)

01:23:35.041 --> 01:23:37.792
- [Dane] Fred, roll
the window down.

01:23:42.583 --> 01:23:44.125
I'm walking over now.

01:23:53.667 --> 01:23:56.917
(gun firing)
- Ah!

01:23:57.000 --> 01:23:57.834
Ah, fuck.

01:24:01.166 --> 01:24:04.041
(Lewis panting)

01:24:08.709 --> 01:24:10.417
- You're part of
Roselli's guys, huh?

01:24:21.875 --> 01:24:24.417
- [Dane] I did
this, all of this.

01:24:26.333 --> 01:24:29.250
- Go ahead, kill me.

01:24:29.333 --> 01:24:29.375
Then what?

01:24:31.291 --> 01:24:32.583
- [Dane] Part of me
aches for vengeance

01:24:32.667 --> 01:24:35.041
for what you've done,
but this isn't that.

01:24:35.125 --> 01:24:35.291
This is a warning.

01:24:37.166 --> 01:24:39.041
If you ever come
near my family again,

01:24:39.125 --> 01:24:42.291
I will finish what
I started tonight.

01:24:52.875 --> 01:24:54.834
- [Harry] We're good?

01:24:54.917 --> 01:24:56.125
- [Dane] I'm good, Harry.

01:24:57.834 --> 01:25:00.500
(Lewis sighing)

01:25:40.417 --> 01:25:42.333
(phone beeping)

01:25:47.208 --> 01:25:49.709
(gentle music)

01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:17.709
(Princess barking)

01:26:17.792 --> 01:26:18.583
- Come on.

01:26:20.083 --> 01:26:21.750
Come on, Princess.

01:26:26.208 --> 01:26:27.000
Good girl.

01:26:33.333 --> 01:26:34.166
Come on.

01:26:36.667 --> 01:26:37.667
Do you wanna race?

01:26:37.750 --> 01:26:38.625
- [Dane] Sure.

01:26:38.709 --> 01:26:39.917
- Ready?
- Ready.

01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:41.792
- Set.
- Set.

01:26:42.208 --> 01:26:44.250
- Go.
- Go.

01:26:44.333 --> 01:26:45.500
Miss you always, babe.

01:26:48.208 --> 01:26:50.583
- [Eden] Hurry up,
little cheater.

01:26:50.667 --> 01:26:52.500
I'm winning.

01:26:54.166 --> 01:26:57.083
(Eden giggling)

01:27:09.250 --> 01:27:12.291
