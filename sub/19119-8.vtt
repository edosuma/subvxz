00:00.768 --> 00:03.471
Previously on Outsiders...

00:03.471 --> 00:04.638
(Big Foster grunts,
woman screams)

00:04.638 --> 00:06.507
BIG FOSTER:
Why did you do it?

00:08.076 --> 00:09.677
GORDON: An action at
the Coal Days Festival.

00:09.677 --> 00:11.479
A real action that
gets real attention.

00:11.479 --> 00:14.782
Now is not the time to back off.

00:14.782 --> 00:16.650
LEDDA:
Coal kills! Coal kills!

00:16.650 --> 00:19.520
-Arrest her!
-(crowd murmurs)

00:19.520 --> 00:22.056
-What you worried about? -Every
time you walk out that door.

00:22.056 --> 00:23.557
Scared you're not
gonna come back.

00:23.557 --> 00:25.326
I'm always coming back.

00:25.326 --> 00:26.327
Uh, we're getting
some noise complaints

00:26.327 --> 00:28.629
-from an address over on Maple.
-(siren wails)

00:28.629 --> 00:30.631
(crowd clamoring, cheering)

00:30.631 --> 00:32.633
Wait! Hey!

00:34.235 --> 00:37.138
Foster Farrell VIII.
I know where he is.

00:37.138 --> 00:39.140
He's being transferred
from a county facility.

00:39.140 --> 00:40.674
State prison
many, many miles away.

00:40.674 --> 00:43.277
Once he gets there, you'll never
lay eyes on him again.

00:43.277 --> 00:44.678
Just tell us what we have to do.

00:44.678 --> 00:46.780
(ATV engines revving)

00:48.549 --> 00:49.783
Yeah!

00:52.620 --> 00:53.621
(men grunting)

00:55.589 --> 00:57.791
Why ain't you dead like
you're supposed to be?

00:57.791 --> 01:00.694
-What's wrong with you?
-Get your goddamn hands off me.

01:03.497 --> 01:05.266
I brought you home.

01:21.315 --> 01:23.284
(panting)

01:25.786 --> 01:27.688
Glan lauggh thee.

01:27.688 --> 01:29.490
ALL:
Glan lauggh thee!

01:38.766 --> 01:41.535
The mountain welcomes you home.

01:49.243 --> 01:51.212
Thank you, cousin.

02:00.621 --> 02:03.757
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

02:03.757 --> 02:05.125
Sorry.

02:07.728 --> 02:09.497
Thank you. Sorry.

02:18.272 --> 02:20.441
Lil Foster!

02:20.441 --> 02:22.676
Living proof that even
their prisons can't hold us.

02:22.676 --> 02:23.677
(crowd chuckles)

02:23.677 --> 02:26.647
Here you are, cousin.

02:26.647 --> 02:28.649
What the hell
is this, Cornbread?

02:28.649 --> 02:30.518
A real live jacket,
you peckerwood.

02:30.518 --> 02:31.719
(laughter)

02:31.719 --> 02:34.388
LIL FOSTER:
Oh, wow.

02:36.457 --> 02:37.858
Thank you, Cornbread.

02:37.858 --> 02:39.260
Ged-gedyah!

02:39.260 --> 02:41.229
ALL:
Ged-gedyah!

02:43.831 --> 02:45.599
LIL FOSTER:
Ged-gedyah.

02:47.635 --> 02:48.936
-Ged-gedyah.
-Ged-gedyah.

02:48.936 --> 02:50.604
Ged-gedyah.

02:55.276 --> 02:56.910
(country blues music)

02:58.912 --> 03:02.650
* The dawn is up,
there's fire on the mountain *

03:02.650 --> 03:07.255
* They'll have to answer
for their crooked claim *

03:07.255 --> 03:10.324
* The hollows
they'll surround them *

03:10.324 --> 03:12.760
* And they'll go running back

03:12.760 --> 03:15.863
* To the wretched realm
they came *

03:18.499 --> 03:24.472
* Nor will the dogs
of hell refrain *

03:24.472 --> 03:26.940
* And the land

03:26.940 --> 03:30.544
* Will suffer those who came.

03:35.916 --> 03:37.885
(tires screech)

03:40.954 --> 03:42.923
(dogs barking in distance)

03:46.594 --> 03:48.296
Which house is it?

03:48.296 --> 03:49.830
Neighbor said
he went in that one.

03:51.465 --> 03:53.934
Stay there.
Don't let anybody in or out.

03:53.934 --> 03:56.904
(door creaking softly)

04:10.918 --> 04:13.754
(quiet thumping)

04:30.538 --> 04:32.506
(quiet clattering)

04:37.678 --> 04:40.047
(gun cocks)

04:40.047 --> 04:41.349
Where's the knife?

04:42.983 --> 04:44.652
(man yells)

04:44.652 --> 04:46.720
(both grunting)

04:46.720 --> 04:48.055
Hey!

04:58.732 --> 05:01.001
(handcuffs click)

05:11.412 --> 05:15.716
Obaith wylarn
myrr sa'norrwyn.

05:15.716 --> 05:18.519
Obaith wylarn
myrr sa'norrwyn.

05:19.887 --> 05:22.956
Obaith wylarn
myrr sa'norrwyn.

05:24.792 --> 05:28.061
Obaith wylarn
myrr sa'norrwyn.

05:28.061 --> 05:30.063
(labored breathing)

05:30.063 --> 05:31.765
(Big Foster talking quietly)

05:33.801 --> 05:35.769
Foster.

05:45.413 --> 05:46.880
I'm here, my queen.

05:46.880 --> 05:48.081
Did you get him?

05:48.081 --> 05:51.485
Yeah, we did.

05:51.485 --> 05:54.021
You can see for yourself
soon enough.

05:54.021 --> 05:56.890
I... I don't know about that.

05:59.092 --> 06:00.928
-I'm gonna die.
-No.

06:00.928 --> 06:03.831
Wound's just taking time
to heal is all.

06:03.831 --> 06:05.933
You'll be on your feet

06:05.933 --> 06:08.135
ordering me around
soon as can be.

06:08.135 --> 06:09.970
I got dark red lines
from the wound.

06:09.970 --> 06:11.805
Well, then tell me what to do.

06:11.805 --> 06:13.541
Wait, no, we got
everything right here.

06:13.541 --> 06:15.142
Just tell me what to do with it.

06:15.142 --> 06:19.012
No point. There's nothing here
that can fix it.

06:19.012 --> 06:21.915
Foster, listen to me.

06:21.915 --> 06:25.686
When I go,
that Oak will be yours again.

06:25.686 --> 06:29.623
And you have changed.

06:29.623 --> 06:30.824
I've seen it.

06:30.824 --> 06:34.161
But the darkness
is still there, too.

06:36.129 --> 06:39.099
So I'm afraid, Foster,

06:39.099 --> 06:41.602
that if you lead us again,

06:41.602 --> 06:43.737
more blood will be spilled.

06:43.737 --> 06:45.706
So promise me.

06:48.509 --> 06:51.579
When that Oak is in your hand,

06:51.579 --> 06:54.615
that you will keep
the darkness at bay.

06:54.615 --> 06:57.951
Well, don't go,
and I won't have to.

07:00.721 --> 07:03.657
Promise me, Foster.

07:09.563 --> 07:12.600
ALL: Obaith wylarn
myrr sa'norrwyn.

07:12.600 --> 07:15.903
Obaith wylarn myrr sa'norrwyn.

07:15.903 --> 07:19.540
-Obaith wylarn myrr....
-Oh, so this is your plan, huh?

07:19.540 --> 07:20.841
Right.

07:20.841 --> 07:22.876
Build a pile,
making it out of...

07:22.876 --> 07:26.013
making it out of twigs
and junk, kneeling,

07:26.013 --> 07:28.749
mumbling to yourselves?
Well, you might as well be

07:28.749 --> 07:31.051
wallowing, squealing pigs
for all the good you're doing.

07:31.051 --> 07:33.253
-We're giving her our strength.
-Ah.

07:33.253 --> 07:34.888
Mountain's gonna heal her.

07:34.888 --> 07:36.524
Oh, the mountain?

07:36.524 --> 07:38.025
You want to count on that,
you go right ahead,

07:38.025 --> 07:40.494
but I'm actually gonna go
do something.

07:42.162 --> 07:44.998
ALL: Obaith wylarn
myrr sa'norrwyn.

07:44.998 --> 07:48.502
Obaith wylarn myrr sa'norrwyn.

07:48.502 --> 07:51.505
Obaith wylarn
myrr sa'norrwyn.

07:51.505 --> 07:53.607
You sure you got to go? It's
been real good having you back.

07:53.607 --> 07:54.842
Yeah, well,
I promised the Bren'in

07:54.842 --> 07:56.810
I wasn't gonna
live back and forth.

07:56.810 --> 07:58.912
But you just came back
to help Lil Foster.

07:58.912 --> 08:00.147
Well, that's done now.

08:00.147 --> 08:02.616
BIG FOSTER:
Hey, Hasil.

08:02.616 --> 08:04.151
We're going down with you.

08:04.151 --> 08:06.019
-What?
-Yep.

08:06.019 --> 08:08.722
G'Win is dying. She can't well
minister to herself.

08:08.722 --> 08:10.057
And even if she could,

08:10.057 --> 08:11.892
what's the matter with her
will take more

08:11.892 --> 08:13.994
than roots and berries to fix.
Down below, they got things.

08:13.994 --> 08:15.195
They got pills and needles,

08:15.195 --> 08:16.630
people know what to do with 'em.

08:16.630 --> 08:17.965
So we got to go get her help.

08:17.965 --> 08:19.299
Hell yeah.

08:19.299 --> 08:22.102
Look, Foster,
I-I don't want her...

08:22.102 --> 08:23.537
You don't want her what?

08:23.537 --> 08:24.905
I can't even imagine it,
but look,

08:24.905 --> 08:26.106
after everything
that we just done,

08:26.106 --> 08:29.743
going right back down there?
I...

08:29.743 --> 08:32.112
-I just, I don't know.
-Ah.

08:32.112 --> 08:35.949
Look, maybe... maybe she's meant
to die, all right?

08:35.949 --> 08:37.250
So that you can be the Bren'in.

08:38.752 --> 08:39.953
(grunts)

08:39.953 --> 08:41.722
Don't you ever, ever, ever

08:41.722 --> 08:43.223
say anything like that again,

08:43.223 --> 08:46.927
not any of you.
Don't you even think it!

08:46.927 --> 08:49.697
Now, G'Win is not just
our Bren'in,

08:49.697 --> 08:52.265
she is the best of us!

08:54.067 --> 08:56.169
If anyone here

08:56.169 --> 08:58.071
thinks that we are better off
without her,

08:58.071 --> 09:00.774
that man is gonna have to
answer to me!

09:00.774 --> 09:03.010
Now, any of you don't help me,

09:03.010 --> 09:04.578
you'll be
putting her in the ground

09:04.578 --> 09:07.681
with your own hands, huh?

09:07.681 --> 09:09.182
Now y'all coming with me or not?

09:11.218 --> 09:12.986
For the Bren'in.

09:12.986 --> 09:15.956
-Ged-gedyah.
-Ged-gedyah

09:15.956 --> 09:17.991
Ged-gedyah!

09:17.991 --> 09:19.159
Ged-gedyah.

09:26.967 --> 09:28.235
Sheriff.

09:30.638 --> 09:32.139
Hey. There he is.

09:32.139 --> 09:35.108
-(cheering and applause)
-Okay.

09:35.108 --> 09:37.310
-Okay.
-You're the man. -Good job.

09:37.310 --> 09:39.813
All right, just doing my job.

09:39.813 --> 09:42.049
-Nice police work, Wade.
-Thanks, Matt.

09:42.049 --> 09:44.184
No, really, I'm impressed.

09:44.184 --> 09:46.019
Yeah, well...

09:46.019 --> 09:47.254
I'll cherish that forever.

09:47.254 --> 09:49.122
(laughs)
Fair enough.

09:49.122 --> 09:52.826
'Course there's still the matter
of our other escapee.

09:52.826 --> 09:56.129
Though not much of a mystery
about where he's gone, is there?

09:56.129 --> 09:57.765
No.

09:57.765 --> 09:58.999
Don't suppose you want
me and the deputies

09:58.999 --> 10:00.200
charging back up there?

10:00.200 --> 10:01.702
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

10:01.702 --> 10:04.905
Yeah, you, uh,
don't suppose correctly.

10:04.905 --> 10:06.907
Mind if I close the door?

10:06.907 --> 10:08.408
-Uh...
-'Course you didn't want him

10:08.408 --> 10:10.778
locked up in the first place,
did you?

10:10.778 --> 10:13.013
What's that?

10:13.013 --> 10:14.414
You didn't want to lock him up.

10:14.414 --> 10:16.817
We had a particularly
feisty conversation

10:16.817 --> 10:18.018
about it, as I recall.

10:18.018 --> 10:21.889
Yeah, I... we did.

10:21.889 --> 10:23.156
What's your point?

10:23.156 --> 10:26.059
Nothing, just it was
something that

10:26.059 --> 10:28.696
you had very strong
feelings about.

10:28.696 --> 10:31.665
And, you know, who knows
what someone would do

10:31.665 --> 10:33.033
with a feeling that strong.

10:33.033 --> 10:36.003
Yeah, well, I mean, I...

10:36.003 --> 10:37.437
I couldn't really do anything,

10:37.437 --> 10:39.406
considering that you
pretty much shut me down.

10:39.406 --> 10:42.209
Yeah.

10:42.209 --> 10:44.878
Well, the Farrells
took care of it.

10:44.878 --> 10:48.281
Lucky thing they got a hold of
that prisoner transfer schedule.

10:48.281 --> 10:49.783
Somehow.

10:49.783 --> 10:50.951
Right?

10:53.320 --> 10:55.355
Say, didn't you answer a noise
complaint the other night

10:55.355 --> 10:57.024
about some fight club?

10:58.458 --> 11:00.794
Heard there was a Farrell there.

11:00.794 --> 11:02.696
Did you get a chance
to talk to him?

11:02.696 --> 11:04.031
No.

11:04.031 --> 11:05.465
No I didn't, he ran away.

11:05.465 --> 11:07.367
Hmm.

11:07.367 --> 11:10.037
Are you spying on me?

11:10.037 --> 11:12.873
There some reason
I would need to?

11:12.873 --> 11:15.342
Well, it's just that
if there's anyone to blame

11:15.342 --> 11:16.777
for all this, it's you.

11:16.777 --> 11:19.079
What?

11:19.079 --> 11:21.749
Well, I mean you put that fella
in jail for no good reason,

11:21.749 --> 11:23.851
you know, put up
that stupid fence.

11:23.851 --> 11:25.252
I mean...

11:25.252 --> 11:27.955
you're stupid.

11:27.955 --> 11:29.389
You've been provoking them
since the minute

11:29.389 --> 11:31.792
you got here-- what'd you think
was gonna happen?

11:31.792 --> 11:34.494
Don't look at me cross-eyed

11:34.494 --> 11:36.129
just 'cause you've been
handling this all wrong.

11:38.031 --> 11:40.433
Lot of coincidences,
that's all.

11:42.002 --> 11:46.273
And as for how
I'm handling them?

11:46.273 --> 11:48.008
Things will be a little
different on that front

11:48.008 --> 11:49.843
from now on.

11:51.278 --> 11:53.747
(door opens)

12:04.191 --> 12:06.159
(sighs)
Oh.

12:06.159 --> 12:09.062
-Hey, Carol.
-Ledda. Hi.

12:09.062 --> 12:11.531
-Hey. Oh.
-Here.

12:11.531 --> 12:13.033
What is it?

12:13.033 --> 12:15.435
Just... come in.

12:22.109 --> 12:23.777
(applause)

12:23.777 --> 12:26.079
(all cheering)

12:28.949 --> 12:31.218
(cheering and whistling)

12:35.088 --> 12:37.190
(sighs)

12:37.190 --> 12:38.525
(door opens)

12:38.525 --> 12:41.294
-Hey.
-Wade.

12:41.294 --> 12:43.997
Um...

12:43.997 --> 12:45.532
I need to talk to you.

12:45.532 --> 12:48.936
-Listen, we have had this
conversation, okay? -No...

12:48.936 --> 12:50.303
We just need to each do
what it is

12:50.303 --> 12:52.005
-we're gonna do, Wade.
-No, no, no.

12:52.005 --> 12:54.174
I need you to say that
I was at home two nights ago.

12:54.174 --> 12:56.376
-The night before Coal Days.
-Wh...

12:56.376 --> 12:58.245
You need me to
say that to who?

12:58.245 --> 12:59.947
Anyone who asks.

12:59.947 --> 13:02.549
Wh... Why, where were you?

13:02.549 --> 13:04.284
You can't ask me any questions.

13:04.284 --> 13:05.252
Wade, what did you do?

13:11.158 --> 13:14.027
Okay.

13:14.027 --> 13:16.129
Thank you.

13:16.129 --> 13:18.165
Look, since we're asking
for things...

13:18.165 --> 13:19.466
(sighs)

13:19.466 --> 13:21.902
...I'd like you to lay off
my group.

13:23.303 --> 13:24.504
What?

13:24.504 --> 13:27.040
Mountain Witness.

13:27.040 --> 13:29.176
We're gonna be stepping
things up even more,

13:29.176 --> 13:32.212
and I would appreciate it if
you'd give us a little latitude.

13:32.212 --> 13:34.247
It's not really a good time.

13:34.247 --> 13:36.483
It's a perfect time.

13:36.483 --> 13:39.019
People are more energized
than ever.

13:39.019 --> 13:41.454
-It is the perfect time.
-Ledda, Ledda,

13:41.454 --> 13:43.190
you haven't got any pets left.

13:44.424 --> 13:46.894
So next it's gonna be
one of the kids.

13:46.894 --> 13:49.029
Look at you.

13:49.029 --> 13:50.630
I mean, in your condition?

13:50.630 --> 13:54.067
You're running yourself
to death as it is.

13:55.402 --> 13:57.504
Look...

13:57.504 --> 14:01.341
you asked me for a favor,

14:01.341 --> 14:04.644
and I'm asking you
for a favor.

14:04.644 --> 14:06.446
I got a job to do.

14:08.348 --> 14:10.517
Okay. Yeah.

14:10.517 --> 14:13.220
Ledda...

14:13.220 --> 14:15.122
(sighs)

14:19.159 --> 14:21.561
-(knocks)
-I come in peace.

14:21.561 --> 14:23.096
To do what?

14:23.096 --> 14:26.099
To apologize for the coal dust.
Whoa...

14:26.099 --> 14:27.367
Police can be here
in five minutes.

14:27.367 --> 14:29.036
In the meantime,
I've got Mace in my bag.

14:29.036 --> 14:30.670
Really, I'm just here
to say I'm sorry.

14:30.670 --> 14:33.106
Apology not accepted.

14:40.280 --> 14:42.082
Why don't you tell me
why you're really here?

14:42.082 --> 14:46.419
You know, every time I do this,
there's always one of you.

14:46.419 --> 14:49.990
The boots on the ground getting
dirty for the higher-ups.

14:49.990 --> 14:52.259
But what do you really get

14:52.259 --> 14:56.063
when it's all over
and they're done using you?

14:56.063 --> 14:58.631
You know, I'm gonna answer
your question with a question.

14:58.631 --> 15:01.101
In all the times
that you've done this,

15:01.101 --> 15:03.136
have you ever actually won?

15:03.136 --> 15:05.105
Well, I guess that depends on
what you mean by winning.

15:05.105 --> 15:07.440
I mean stopped the thing
you went there to stop.

15:07.440 --> 15:10.643
Once or twice. Not usually.

15:10.643 --> 15:14.147
But it's not about the battle,
it's about the war.

15:14.147 --> 15:15.915
And that is far from over.

15:18.318 --> 15:22.255
Listen, Haylie, how much do you
actually know about this place?

15:22.255 --> 15:25.092
This mountain that you're
so determined to destroy?

15:27.127 --> 15:30.330
I'm going up there for a hike
this weekend.

15:30.330 --> 15:31.664
Why don't you come with me?

15:31.664 --> 15:34.367
See what's actually up there,

15:34.367 --> 15:37.204
what you want to just
sweep away.

15:37.204 --> 15:40.207
You know...

15:40.207 --> 15:43.443
everywhere I go,
there's one of you.

15:43.443 --> 15:49.016
An activist who thinks
I can be shamed or bullied

15:49.016 --> 15:52.452
or manipulated
or talked around.

15:52.452 --> 15:54.387
Who thinks I'm not gonna
do my job,

15:54.387 --> 15:57.390
the job I'm paid,
and paid very well, to do.

15:57.390 --> 15:59.092
I wonder why that is?

15:59.092 --> 16:01.294
(Haylie clears her throat)

16:09.569 --> 16:12.105
(door opens, hinges creak)

16:12.105 --> 16:14.374
(people outside chanting
quietly)

16:29.089 --> 16:30.423
(door closes)

16:58.485 --> 17:01.288
I wish I would've been here.

17:04.391 --> 17:07.160
I would've protected you.

17:10.397 --> 17:13.032
I would've protected you
till my dying breath.

17:19.639 --> 17:22.709
I know now why
you did what you did,

17:22.709 --> 17:25.212
marrying my Fa.

17:29.749 --> 17:32.652
You did what you had to do
to survive.

17:47.767 --> 17:51.571
Obaith wylarn
myrr sa'norrwyn.

17:51.571 --> 17:54.807
Obaith wylarn myrr sa'norrwyn.

17:54.807 --> 17:58.378
Obaith wylarn
myrr sa'norrwyn.

17:58.378 --> 18:01.648
Obaith wylarn myrr sa'norrwyn.

18:01.648 --> 18:05.318
Obaith wylarn
myrr sa'norrwyn.

18:05.318 --> 18:09.156
Obaith wylarn myrr sa'norrwyn.

18:09.156 --> 18:12.459
Obaith wylarn
myrr sa'norrwyn.

18:12.459 --> 18:14.627
Obaith wylarn myrr sa'norrwyn.

18:14.627 --> 18:19.366
Obaith wylarn
myrr sa'norrwyn.

18:19.366 --> 18:23.536
Obaith wylarn myrr sa'norrwyn.

18:23.536 --> 18:27.240
Obaith wylarn
myrr sa'norrwyn.

18:27.240 --> 18:30.243
Obaith wylarn myrr sa'norrwyn.

18:30.243 --> 18:34.147
Obaith wylarn

18:34.147 --> 18:37.116
Obaith wylarn myrr sa'norrwyn.

19:02.475 --> 19:04.811
(indistinct voices)

19:16.723 --> 19:18.458
(quietly):
Could we go around?

19:18.458 --> 19:19.826
(quietly):
This is around.

19:19.826 --> 19:21.728
This is the way
they don't usually guard.

19:23.730 --> 19:26.499
Let's just wait a minute,
maybe they'll just head off.

19:29.269 --> 19:32.272
(low chatter, laughing)

19:33.640 --> 19:35.242
Oh, the hell with this.

19:35.242 --> 19:36.909
GUARD:
Who's there?!

19:36.909 --> 19:39.512
Foster, stop,
you're gonna get killed.

19:39.512 --> 19:41.748
-BIG FOSTER: Wait, go, go,
go, go, go! -(gunfire)

19:41.748 --> 19:44.284
-Go, go! Go, go, go!
-(gunfire continue)

19:49.689 --> 19:52.225
-Go!
-GUARD: Stay where you are!

19:52.225 --> 19:53.760
-Don't move!
-(gunfire)

19:53.760 --> 19:54.994
-(Enoch cries out)
-Oh, Enoch!

19:54.994 --> 19:56.663
-Phil'up! Phil'up!
-Enoch!

19:56.663 --> 19:58.565
(gunfire continues)

20:00.300 --> 20:01.901
Trevor!

20:01.901 --> 20:04.471
(gunfire continues)

20:07.440 --> 20:09.709
(grunts)

20:13.813 --> 20:15.315
BIG FOSTER:
Stay with us, boy.

20:15.315 --> 20:17.717
Right here, okay.
Just stay with us.

20:17.717 --> 20:19.018
Are you okay?

20:19.018 --> 20:20.520
Okay, come one.

20:20.520 --> 20:22.489
Come on, cousin.

20:22.489 --> 20:24.391
Boy, come on.

20:24.391 --> 20:26.459
Come on, cousin,
come on, just stay.

20:26.459 --> 20:27.660
Stay right here, okay, boy?

20:27.660 --> 20:32.565
Maybe we should...
go down...

20:32.565 --> 20:34.801
-and get me some medicine.
-Enoch.

20:34.801 --> 20:36.469
(Enoch laughing weakly)

20:39.639 --> 20:41.341
(gasping)

20:42.542 --> 20:44.744
Come on.

20:44.744 --> 20:46.413
Come on!

20:47.447 --> 20:49.549
Come on.

20:49.549 --> 20:51.718
-Enoch...
-No, no.

20:52.952 --> 20:54.387
Don't you touch him!

20:55.388 --> 20:56.389
You done enough!

20:57.624 --> 20:59.459
Come on.

20:59.459 --> 21:01.294
Phil'up, come on.

21:15.675 --> 21:17.977
(metallic creaking)

21:22.048 --> 21:24.050
(hinges creaking)

21:24.050 --> 21:26.753
(knocking "Shave and a Haircut")

21:26.753 --> 21:28.054
MAN (inside):
Yeah?

21:28.054 --> 21:29.989
I got a delivery for Steve.

21:32.024 --> 21:34.060
Hi. I'm Steve.

21:34.060 --> 21:35.828
Well, shit.

21:35.828 --> 21:38.064
-I don't know where he's at.
-Oh, you don't?

21:38.064 --> 21:39.866
No. I mean, he went back
to the mountain, so, you know...

21:39.866 --> 21:41.868
So like, he went back up
the mountain,

21:41.868 --> 21:43.670
or you don't know where he's at,
I mean, which one?

21:43.670 --> 21:45.538
Both. Both of those.

21:45.538 --> 21:47.340
Listen, I just want
to talk to him.

21:47.340 --> 21:50.543
-I need an address.
-He's not there all the time.

21:50.543 --> 21:51.644
Not where all the time?

21:54.113 --> 21:56.649
(door hinges creak)

22:00.920 --> 22:03.022
(door closes)

22:09.929 --> 22:12.632
Let me guess.

22:12.632 --> 22:14.667
I should see the other guy,
right?

22:14.667 --> 22:16.636
Sally-Ann, not right now.

22:16.636 --> 22:18.137
So when then?

22:18.137 --> 22:19.839
'Cause this baby's coming

22:19.839 --> 22:22.041
-whether you're ready or not.
-I know that.

22:23.876 --> 22:27.880
All right, but you have no idea
what I just been through.

22:27.880 --> 22:30.550
So tell me.

22:30.550 --> 22:32.685
Hasil, just tell me.

22:38.691 --> 22:42.061
HASIL (inhales deeply):
Mm.

22:44.764 --> 22:46.633
Forget it.

22:46.633 --> 22:48.067
I know this song by heart.

22:50.737 --> 22:53.706
"Something that you had to do
for your family."

22:53.706 --> 22:55.141
What are you doing?

22:55.141 --> 22:57.544
I'm going to stay with a cousin
in Cleveland.

22:57.544 --> 22:58.511
Where is that?

22:58.511 --> 23:00.046
(sighs)

23:01.914 --> 23:03.550
All right, so what-what you
gonna do? You just gonna go?

23:03.550 --> 23:04.817
You just gonna
walk out the door?

23:04.817 --> 23:06.152
Because Sally-Ann,
I need you right now.

23:06.152 --> 23:07.554
I need you!

23:07.554 --> 23:09.556
I need you, Hasil.

23:11.591 --> 23:13.593
And you just...

23:17.497 --> 23:19.632
I'm going to Butch and Frida's
for the night,

23:19.632 --> 23:22.769
-and I'll be back tomorrow.
-(Hansil sniffles)

23:22.769 --> 23:24.637
And if you're here,

23:24.637 --> 23:26.639
then you're here for good.

23:26.639 --> 23:29.442
And if not, I will pack the rest
of my things and I'll go.

23:31.110 --> 23:33.179
Because I can't do this...

23:33.179 --> 23:35.081
anymore.

23:36.483 --> 23:39.519
(door opens, closes)

23:42.154 --> 23:45.792
CROWD (quietly):
Obaith wylarn myrr sa'norrwyn.

23:45.792 --> 23:49.862
Obaith wylarn
myrr sa'norrwyn.

23:49.862 --> 23:53.099
(chanting quiets)

23:54.801 --> 23:57.136
(low murmuring)

23:57.136 --> 23:59.472
EMELYE:
Shame on you, Foster.

24:25.798 --> 24:27.166
SALLY-ANN:
I said it to him.

24:27.166 --> 24:29.268
I said that the thing
that scares me the most

24:29.268 --> 24:30.837
is that one day,
you're just gonna go away

24:30.837 --> 24:32.071
and not come back.

24:32.071 --> 24:33.706
And what does he do?

24:33.706 --> 24:35.274
He goes away
and he doesn't come back.

24:35.274 --> 24:38.511
Well, he's working.
He's trying to provide.

24:38.511 --> 24:40.212
I know what they're doing,
Frida.

24:42.148 --> 24:44.216
I hear he's really good at it.

24:44.216 --> 24:45.818
I'm sure.

24:45.818 --> 24:47.554
I saw him fight plenty
the week that we met,

24:47.554 --> 24:48.955
but that's not the point.
The point is:

24:48.955 --> 24:50.690
that I can't count on him.

24:50.690 --> 24:53.025
And this time, I'm not even sure
he was with Butch.

24:53.025 --> 24:54.594
Where do you think he was?

24:59.966 --> 25:01.901
I got a cousin in Cleveland.

25:01.901 --> 25:05.638
I don't know her all that well,
but I gave her a call and...

25:07.073 --> 25:09.542
...I'm-a go stay with her.

25:09.542 --> 25:11.544
For the baby.

25:11.544 --> 25:13.913
You do what you think
you need to do,

25:13.913 --> 25:16.315
but love ain't easy to find.

25:16.315 --> 25:19.719
This may come as a surprise
to you, but Butch,

25:19.719 --> 25:21.320
he ain't perfect. Mm-mm.

25:21.320 --> 25:23.155
There are times
when he is talking

25:23.155 --> 25:24.957
and I just want to stab him
right in the eye,

25:24.957 --> 25:28.094
but he loves me.

25:28.094 --> 25:30.162
And he takes care of me.

25:30.162 --> 25:32.198
And he accepts me as I am.

25:32.198 --> 25:35.602
And Hasil loves you.

25:35.602 --> 25:36.869
And he is cute!

25:36.869 --> 25:40.973
(chuckles)
I mean, that hair.

25:40.973 --> 25:42.909
I'm just saying...

25:42.909 --> 25:44.176
if I was you,
I would think twice

25:44.176 --> 25:45.544
before I threw all that away.

25:51.250 --> 25:53.219
I don't think I can do it.

25:55.087 --> 25:58.758
Everything I touch...

25:58.758 --> 26:00.627
blood...

26:00.627 --> 26:02.795
and more blood.

26:05.765 --> 26:09.068
If I take that Oak,

26:09.068 --> 26:12.204
the darkness is gonna win.

26:14.173 --> 26:17.844
Obaith wylarn
myrr sa'norrwyn.

26:17.844 --> 26:19.946
-BIG FOSTER: Son?
-(chanting continues)

26:19.946 --> 26:21.881
Can I speak with you?

26:21.881 --> 26:23.215
Why?

26:23.215 --> 26:26.585
Just come with me. Please.

26:27.787 --> 26:31.390
Obaith wylarn myrr sa'norrwyn.

26:31.390 --> 26:34.226
Obaith wylarn
myrr sa'norrwyn.

26:34.226 --> 26:35.962
LIL FOSTER: You want me to
follow you back down there

26:35.962 --> 26:37.830
so I could be the next
to be killed?

26:37.830 --> 26:40.032
BIG FOSTER:
You heard about Enoch.

26:40.032 --> 26:42.334
LIL FOSTER:
Of course I did.

26:42.334 --> 26:46.839
BIG FOSTER:
Oh... oh.

26:46.839 --> 26:50.042
My father, Foster V,

26:50.042 --> 26:51.844
you were just a boy
when he passed,

26:51.844 --> 26:55.682
but he was like the sun,
the moon and the stars to me.

26:55.682 --> 26:59.085
He was powerful,
and he was warm,

26:59.085 --> 27:01.153
and he led by love, not fear,

27:01.153 --> 27:04.991
with that Oak in his hand
and then,

27:04.991 --> 27:06.625
he was gone.

27:08.260 --> 27:10.963
And my mother,

27:10.963 --> 27:13.733
she took it.

27:13.733 --> 27:15.735
And she was terrible to me.

27:15.735 --> 27:18.705
She shamed me
every chance she got,

27:18.705 --> 27:20.439
with that mountain Oak
by her side.

27:20.439 --> 27:22.108
And after a while,

27:22.108 --> 27:25.011
it was all I wanted
to get my hands on that Oak.

27:25.011 --> 27:27.279
So I became the demon.

27:27.279 --> 27:29.348
Me.

27:29.348 --> 27:32.719
G'Win is right.

27:32.719 --> 27:34.020
We've tainted this mountain.

27:34.020 --> 27:36.823
I have. I have tainted it...

27:36.823 --> 27:40.226
by what I've done.

27:40.226 --> 27:43.229
I killed my mother,
I killed our ways.

27:43.229 --> 27:45.865
And try as I might to change,

27:45.865 --> 27:48.835
I kill everything I touch.

27:48.835 --> 27:52.038
The mountain,
it wants a sacrifice,

27:52.038 --> 27:55.241
and right now,
it's taking G'Win.

27:55.241 --> 27:57.977
And nothing that we do
to heal her

27:57.977 --> 28:02.248
is gonna help, short of
someone taking her place.

28:02.248 --> 28:05.051
So, I need you
to do something for me.

28:05.051 --> 28:07.419
'Cause it ain't gonna work

28:07.419 --> 28:08.888
if I do it myself.

28:08.888 --> 28:10.890
I need you...

28:10.890 --> 28:13.726
to kill me.

28:19.231 --> 28:21.300
I know just the place.

28:26.105 --> 28:27.940
(door opens)

28:27.940 --> 28:29.341
BARTENDER:
Another glass of wine?

28:29.341 --> 28:32.078
-HAYLIE: Yes, please.
-(phone keys clicking)

28:33.145 --> 28:34.446
Well, hello again.

28:37.116 --> 28:39.752
You know stalking's illegal.

28:39.752 --> 28:41.153
Are we ever gonna
have a conversation

28:41.153 --> 28:42.454
that doesn't begin
with you threatening

28:42.454 --> 28:44.223
to sick law enforcement on me?

28:44.223 --> 28:45.758
I think the real question is:

28:45.758 --> 28:48.494
why are we having
so many conversations?

28:49.762 --> 28:51.463
Thank you.

28:51.463 --> 28:53.232
So is this how
you spend your evenings?

28:53.232 --> 28:56.102
Alone in a hotel bar?

28:56.102 --> 28:58.504
Are you concerned about me,
Gordon?

28:58.504 --> 29:00.306
No, I mean, it's just
a little sad is all.

29:00.306 --> 29:03.075
You know, what, with all the
culture this place has to offer.

29:03.075 --> 29:05.344
(laughs)

29:05.344 --> 29:06.846
(groans)

29:06.846 --> 29:09.281
I'm serious.
There's a whole world out here.

29:09.281 --> 29:11.851
You are still trying to get me
to come on that hike, huh?

29:11.851 --> 29:15.888
No, but the offer is still open.

29:15.888 --> 29:17.523
Here, check this out.

29:20.559 --> 29:22.361
(sighs)
What are those?

29:22.361 --> 29:24.563
I've been a lot of places,
like I said.

29:24.563 --> 29:27.166
And everywhere I go,
I come across

29:27.166 --> 29:29.201
what they call outsider art,

29:29.201 --> 29:30.369
just paintings,

29:30.369 --> 29:32.038
sculpture, music.

29:32.038 --> 29:33.472
Ah, here we go.

29:33.472 --> 29:35.174
Totally unschooled local folks

29:35.174 --> 29:37.143
following some sort
of inner muse.

29:37.143 --> 29:41.113
Untainted by whatever
fashionable idea of what art

29:41.113 --> 29:42.849
should or shouldn't be.

29:44.350 --> 29:45.918
Okay.

29:45.918 --> 29:47.186
It's a little compilation
I made,

29:47.186 --> 29:49.055
of music
performed by those people

29:49.055 --> 29:50.589
that I've met on my travels.

29:50.589 --> 29:53.192
I'm still not seeing what that
has to do with me.

29:53.192 --> 29:57.163
Well, if I can't bring you
to see what you're killing,

29:57.163 --> 30:00.532
maybe I'll bring
what you're killing... to you.

30:00.532 --> 30:03.936
So you want me to listen to it.

30:03.936 --> 30:05.838
Yeah.
(chuckles)

30:05.838 --> 30:08.474
How? Holding it up to my ear?

30:08.474 --> 30:10.542
You're telling me you don't have
a means to play that thing?

30:10.542 --> 30:13.579
-Come on.
-Not here in the bar, no.

30:13.579 --> 30:15.814
All right, well, maybe we don't
stay at the bar.

30:17.950 --> 30:20.352
-You've got to be kidding me.
-What?

30:20.352 --> 30:22.121
That's the worst pick-up line
I've ever heard in my life.

30:22.121 --> 30:24.190
"Let's go back to your room

30:24.190 --> 30:26.392
"so I can play you
my compilation CD

30:26.392 --> 30:28.861
of Appalachian hill people
music?"

30:28.861 --> 30:30.129
(laughs)

30:30.129 --> 30:31.463
(whoops)
Nice try.

30:31.463 --> 30:34.166
All right. Fine, suit yourself.

30:34.166 --> 30:36.202
But it's really good.

30:38.470 --> 30:39.571
Try again.

30:42.909 --> 30:45.878
(Appalachian music plays)

30:48.915 --> 30:50.649
(Gordon sighs)

30:50.649 --> 30:54.987
(Appalachian music continues)

30:54.987 --> 30:59.258
(Haylie moaning)

30:59.258 --> 31:01.260
(knocking)

31:01.260 --> 31:02.962
Who is it?

31:02.962 --> 31:05.464
It's Wade.

31:05.464 --> 31:07.133
HASIL:
Wade. Who?

31:07.133 --> 31:09.301
It's the sheriff.

31:15.341 --> 31:17.543
The river becomes a flood.

31:17.543 --> 31:19.178
What's that?

31:19.178 --> 31:21.213
(door closes)

31:21.213 --> 31:23.549
Nothing.
Long day, what do you want?

31:23.549 --> 31:26.585
Well, um, good job.

31:29.455 --> 31:31.590
Nobody got hurt
doing that, uh...

31:31.590 --> 31:33.125
the thing.

31:33.125 --> 31:36.028
What thing?

31:36.028 --> 31:37.596
Right.

31:37.596 --> 31:40.032
Anyway...

31:40.032 --> 31:42.368
what I was thinking is,

31:42.368 --> 31:44.270
with everything that's going on,

31:44.270 --> 31:47.639
I think it wouldn't be bad idea
for you to leave town.

31:47.639 --> 31:49.341
For good.

31:50.409 --> 31:53.179
That so?

31:53.179 --> 31:55.381
I mean, you're obviously pretty
identifiable walking around.

31:56.448 --> 31:58.317
With things amping up,

31:58.317 --> 32:00.552
I can't protect you.

32:00.552 --> 32:03.455
So I think it'd be better
if you just disappear.

32:07.093 --> 32:09.261
Okay.

32:09.261 --> 32:12.965
What's that mean? "Okay."

32:12.965 --> 32:15.134
It means okay.

32:15.134 --> 32:17.236
It means I'll disappear.

32:19.005 --> 32:21.673
It means you ain't gonna see me
around here ever again.

32:21.673 --> 32:23.409
Oh, okay.

32:23.409 --> 32:24.610
Um...

32:24.610 --> 32:26.712
This is a real nice place.

32:26.712 --> 32:28.414
HASIL:
Mm-hmm.

32:28.414 --> 32:30.716
(door opens)

32:33.585 --> 32:35.421
(door closes)

32:35.421 --> 32:36.755
LIL FOSTER:
You said your father

32:36.755 --> 32:39.591
was the sun,
the moon and the stars.

32:39.591 --> 32:42.494
Every boy sees his father
that way.

32:42.494 --> 32:45.264
You remember that time--

32:45.264 --> 32:47.266
I must've been, what, ten?--

32:47.266 --> 32:50.702
we was out hunting buck
and I crouched in the brush,

32:50.702 --> 32:53.739
and I stepped on a twig
or something.

32:53.739 --> 32:55.607
Scared 'em all off.
You remember that?

32:58.144 --> 32:59.445
You remember what you did?

32:59.445 --> 33:02.014
To show me what
a bad mistake it was.

33:02.014 --> 33:04.350
You tied me to a tree...

33:04.350 --> 33:06.452
and left me there for ten days.

33:07.786 --> 33:12.658
Passed out from the thirst
and the hunger.

33:12.658 --> 33:15.394
Chafed so bad from the rope,
it nearly hit bone.

33:15.394 --> 33:17.296
That weren't...

33:17.296 --> 33:19.265
that weren't the last thing
you ever done to me, neither.

33:21.400 --> 33:23.669
That's the tree right there.

33:27.539 --> 33:29.208
BIG FOSTER:
All right.

33:30.409 --> 33:32.578
Then do it. Huh?

33:32.578 --> 33:34.646
Do it. Kill me.

33:34.646 --> 33:36.748
I killed my mother.

33:36.748 --> 33:38.617
You got to kill me.

33:38.617 --> 33:41.120
So go ahead.
Go ahead and do it.

33:43.155 --> 33:45.257
Everything that Lady Ray
passed down to you,

33:45.257 --> 33:47.059
you passed down to me ten times.

33:48.627 --> 33:50.129
Still, I loved you.

33:53.332 --> 33:55.534
No, I ain't gonna kill you.

33:55.534 --> 33:59.105
It's better to let you live,
suffer through it.

34:00.339 --> 34:02.441
You are the demon.

34:02.441 --> 34:06.378
Spilling more blood
just taints this mountain more.

34:08.647 --> 34:11.383
(grunts)

34:11.383 --> 34:13.485
You're the only one
that can save her.

34:13.485 --> 34:16.488
All right? So do it!

34:16.488 --> 34:18.190
If you don't do it,

34:18.190 --> 34:20.759
-she will die.
-You...

34:30.802 --> 34:33.172
She never loved you.

34:57.163 --> 35:00.132
Farrells don't kill Farrells.

35:00.132 --> 35:02.100
(panting)

35:28.227 --> 35:30.496
(gun clicking)

35:47.746 --> 35:50.382
Elon.

35:53.552 --> 35:55.587
My boy.

35:55.587 --> 35:57.889
My son.

35:59.725 --> 36:01.727
Are you...

36:01.727 --> 36:04.563
Are you really here?

36:04.563 --> 36:06.798
(whimpers)

36:06.798 --> 36:08.800
Oh, I'm so sorry.

36:08.800 --> 36:12.371
I am sorry
that I let you get hurt.

36:12.371 --> 36:14.673
Thank you for letting me see you
one more time.

36:14.673 --> 36:16.875
I've missed you so much.

36:19.578 --> 36:21.680
(whispering)

36:30.722 --> 36:32.558
Thank you.

Still here.

38:48.394 --> 38:49.528
(Hasil grunts)

38:53.098 --> 38:55.801
Something bad happened.

38:57.035 --> 38:59.137
One of my cousins,

38:59.137 --> 39:02.741
a friend,
he got hit by a bullet.

39:04.743 --> 39:07.112
We got separated,
and now I don't know

39:07.112 --> 39:09.581
if he's alive or dead.

39:17.489 --> 39:19.525
You want to go to him?

(Hasil inhales)

39:20.659 --> 39:21.793

39:27.165 --> 39:29.635
Won't make any difference now.

39:33.772 --> 39:35.741
I'm sorry.

39:40.045 --> 39:43.014
Anyway, there's something
that I got to do for my family.

39:44.750 --> 39:46.652
FRIDA:
Come on out and show us!

39:46.652 --> 39:48.654
HASIL:
Don't want to.

39:48.654 --> 39:50.722
SALLY-ANN:
Babe?

39:50.722 --> 39:52.123
-Come on.
-(chuckles)

39:52.123 --> 39:54.059
Come on.

39:55.193 --> 39:57.996
SALLY-ANN (quietly):
Oh...

39:57.996 --> 40:00.499
(Sally-Ann laughs softly)

40:04.035 --> 40:06.672
(chuckling):
All right. Look...

40:06.672 --> 40:09.541
-I look ridiculous.
-SALLY-ANN (laughing): No! No.

40:09.541 --> 40:11.109
-It's cute.
-Mm-hmm.

40:11.109 --> 40:14.713
And it's just temporary. Okay?

40:14.713 --> 40:18.784
Until we find you
something that's more... you.

40:18.784 --> 40:21.453
Good, 'cause Butch is gonna want
these clothes back anyway.

40:21.453 --> 40:22.788
Why?

40:22.788 --> 40:24.122
(quietly):
Don't know why.

40:24.122 --> 40:26.024
Beggars can't be choosers,
y'all.

40:26.024 --> 40:27.726
No, it's just,
I-I look in the mirror,

40:27.726 --> 40:29.561
and I just, I don't see myself.

40:29.561 --> 40:31.129
That's kind of the point,
isn't it?

40:32.564 --> 40:34.533
I guess. Yeah.

40:36.468 --> 40:37.803
Hey.

40:41.807 --> 40:44.476
I see you. Okay?

40:44.476 --> 40:45.777

40:55.253 --> 40:57.856
Mm...
(laughs)

Uh... I'm just gonna
let myself out, then.

Excuse me.

41:23.615 --> 41:25.083
What happened?

41:25.083 --> 41:27.218
Hilda?

41:30.589 --> 41:33.091
Your daughter was in a fight.

41:33.091 --> 41:35.661
A what? A fight?

41:35.661 --> 41:38.296
-It wasn't my fault, Mom.
-Okay, what happened?

41:38.296 --> 41:39.998
She grabbed one of her
classmates and threw her

41:39.998 --> 41:41.800
to the ground.
They had to be separated.

41:41.800 --> 41:43.602
My daughter
would never do that.

41:43.602 --> 41:45.136
I mean, not unless
she was provoked.

41:45.136 --> 41:47.939
What did this other girl
do to her?

41:47.939 --> 41:50.241
Apparently,
she said something about you.

41:50.241 --> 41:53.144
About how your organization's
hurting the town. Now,

41:53.144 --> 41:55.547
the other girl's parents are
prepared to let this thing go,

41:55.547 --> 41:58.216
but the school's policy
on violence mandates

41:58.216 --> 42:00.952
-a three day suspension
on a first... -Uh, h-hang on,

42:00.952 --> 42:02.988
hang on, hang on. W-What...
(chuckles)

42:02.988 --> 42:06.692
What about your policy
for insulting someone's mother?

42:06.692 --> 42:08.660
-Mom...
-No.

42:08.660 --> 42:11.162
-Why is my daughter the
only one on the hook here? -Mom.

42:11.162 --> 42:15.033
What... happened to this other
girl and what she said?

42:15.033 --> 42:18.870
What kind of message
does that send? Huh?

42:18.870 --> 42:22.307
Punishing someone for standing
up for what is right

42:22.307 --> 42:26.311
and l-letting the person
who started it all comple...

42:26.311 --> 42:29.114
(coughing)

42:30.582 --> 42:32.150
You all right, Mrs. Dobbs?

42:32.150 --> 42:34.720
-(coughing)
-Mom?

42:38.757 --> 42:42.193
HOUGHTON: It's not too late to
start treatment, you know that.

42:42.193 --> 42:44.162
I mean, everything I said...

42:44.162 --> 42:46.197
-you can still do that.
-No.

42:46.197 --> 42:49.868
I still don't want to do that.

42:49.868 --> 42:52.270
(chuckles) You were right,
though, Wade.

42:53.705 --> 42:55.707
I just... I felt so good,

42:55.707 --> 42:57.876
doing what I was doing.

42:57.876 --> 43:01.146
But, uh, I can't...

43:01.146 --> 43:05.016
I can't outrun this forever.

43:19.831 --> 43:24.202
I love you very much.

43:24.202 --> 43:26.838
You know I'm gonna...

43:26.838 --> 43:29.274
I'll take care of them.

43:29.274 --> 43:31.810
-(sniffles)
-I'll take care of everything.

43:34.846 --> 43:36.815
I know.

43:38.383 --> 43:40.351
You have to tell them.

43:43.254 --> 43:44.956
(sniffling)

43:44.956 --> 43:47.893
I know.

43:47.893 --> 43:50.762
(exhales)

43:50.762 --> 43:53.031
Will... Will you stay here?

43:53.031 --> 43:54.933
-Yeah.
-Okay.

43:56.968 --> 43:58.937
I'll bring them in.

43:58.937 --> 44:01.239
Okay.

44:05.677 --> 44:07.679
(door opens)

44:07.679 --> 44:09.681
HOUGHTON:
Hey, Hilda, Abby.

44:10.882 --> 44:12.851
Come on.

44:19.791 --> 44:22.393
Obaith wylarn myrr sa'norrwyn.

44:22.393 --> 44:25.396
Obaith wylarn
myrr sa'norrwyn.

44:25.396 --> 44:29.434
-(door opens) -Obaith wylarn
myrr sa'norrwyn.

44:29.434 --> 44:31.970
Obaith wylarn myrr sa'norrwyn.

44:48.386 --> 44:50.856
(excited murmuring)

44:52.357 --> 44:54.826
(excited murmuring
continues)
