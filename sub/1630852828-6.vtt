PRESENTS

00:12.800 --> 00:14.600
<i>-Bienvenida!</i>
<i>-Bienvenida!</i>

00:14.680 --> 00:16.320
<i>Money Heist.</i>

00:16.400 --> 00:17.280
Yes, of course.

00:17.360 --> 00:18.200
And who are you?

00:18.280 --> 00:19.680
Mia Wallace.

00:20.480 --> 00:21.400
<i>Pulp Fiction.</i>

00:23.520 --> 00:24.640
I brought some wine.

00:24.720 --> 00:27.640
Good. <i>Ándale, cariño.</i>
Come on, let's go to <i>la fiesta.</i>

00:28.600 --> 00:29.880
<i>Nachito! Un nachito!</i>

00:29.960 --> 00:32.680
Please, <i>cariño.</i> Please.

00:34.680 --> 00:37.680
They're all crazy. Everyone, all crazy.

00:37.760 --> 00:40.040
Seriously, deep down I think I am too.

00:42.000 --> 00:44.920
But now I'm going to enjoy
being by myself. It will do me good.

00:45.000 --> 00:45.840
<i>Salud!</i>

00:51.120 --> 00:54.680
It should be Francisco.
He said he'd be a little early.

00:56.280 --> 00:58.280
He's a friend. I don't think you know him.

00:58.360 --> 01:01.160
He went to university with Sócrates.

01:02.800 --> 01:05.040
He's also recently separated.

01:16.200 --> 01:18.000
No, between you and me,
no one can hear us.

01:18.560 --> 01:22.680
Back then, he already thought
he was better than everyone else.

01:22.760 --> 01:24.200
"I get what I want," etc.

01:24.280 --> 01:26.240
A bit of a moron, basically.

01:26.960 --> 01:29.880
And on top of all that,
he cheated on every exam.

01:31.920 --> 01:34.880
That's what I keep telling Diana,
people don't change.

01:34.960 --> 01:40.240
-If you're born a moron, you die a moron.
-There you go. You're such a determinist.

01:40.320 --> 01:43.800
Wait a minute,
I need to check what that means.

01:43.880 --> 01:46.000
-Determinist.
-Go and research it.

01:46.080 --> 01:48.600
Of course.
Remember when people said something

01:48.680 --> 01:52.000
and we had no way of proving
that they were just showing off.

01:52.080 --> 01:55.000
Right? Using expressions they learned
in their first year of college,

01:55.080 --> 01:56.680
isn't that so, my love?

02:00.760 --> 02:02.200
You guys don't change.

02:03.760 --> 02:06.440
-Never, ever.
-You don't change.

02:06.520 --> 02:08.600
Sometimes a little bit. Just to…

02:08.680 --> 02:09.760
No. We don't change.

02:09.840 --> 02:11.880
-It's your fault.
-It's your fault.

02:11.960 --> 02:14.480
You already know it's your fault.
It is your fault.

02:15.200 --> 02:18.080
All right, it's my fault.

02:33.000 --> 02:34.120
Mia Wallace.

02:35.160 --> 02:36.640
Vincent Vega.

02:41.600 --> 02:45.760
You know, in the movie, this raincoat…

02:46.760 --> 02:47.840
it's mine.

02:54.880 --> 02:56.040
Try to get it.

03:04.880 --> 03:08.120
Before you get any big ideas,
I'm warning you that I'm married.

03:08.680 --> 03:10.000
Still.

03:10.080 --> 03:11.880
But it's nothing that can't be fixed.

03:17.160 --> 03:21.200
I'm sorry, but we've been sitting here
for over five minutes.

03:28.520 --> 03:30.080
What's your name?

03:32.200 --> 03:33.200
Joel.

03:35.200 --> 03:37.640
Joel. Look, Joel.

03:38.600 --> 03:40.560
Five stars just for you.

03:55.680 --> 03:57.200
Oh, Joel.

03:59.080 --> 04:00.600
I think I'm in love.

05:28.760 --> 05:31.360
The rest of the night,
it better stay between us.

05:31.440 --> 05:34.400
We fooled around all night long.

05:34.480 --> 05:38.840
-Look at you bragging.
-Did we, or did we not?

05:38.920 --> 05:41.680
But, yes, that's true.

05:42.960 --> 05:45.200
Yeah, and back to the wedding.

05:46.200 --> 05:48.240
Masquerade! Don't you think it's great?

05:48.320 --> 05:50.560
Everyone dressed up
as if it were a carnival.

05:50.640 --> 05:54.240
And not that many people, right?
Just family and close friends.

05:54.920 --> 05:55.960
I just remembered.

05:56.040 --> 05:58.800
You must meet my parents
before we get married.

05:58.880 --> 06:01.360
Yes, of course.
It's the least I can do, isn't it?

06:01.440 --> 06:03.800
I haven't met my in-laws yet.

06:08.360 --> 06:14.080
How do you pronounce
the name of this planet?

06:14.160 --> 06:16.680
You make a beautiful couple.

06:17.160 --> 06:19.280
-Thank you.
-It's true.

06:19.960 --> 06:22.480
I wish you both seven happy years.

06:22.560 --> 06:23.680
Dad, don't even start.

06:24.360 --> 06:26.560
Oh, love, it's okay. It's just a joke.

06:27.720 --> 06:28.640
Alexandre.

06:29.120 --> 06:31.840
Take good care of my daughter.

06:31.920 --> 06:34.600
Mom, it's not Alexandre, it's Francisco.

06:35.080 --> 06:36.120
Who's Alexandre?

06:36.720 --> 06:39.160
My first husband,
but let's not talk about it now.

06:39.240 --> 06:41.280
Wasn't Sandro the first husband?

06:42.280 --> 06:43.960
No, Dad,
you know very well that it wasn't.

06:44.040 --> 06:46.760
Damn it, there's only two of them.
Is it so hard to get them straight?

06:46.840 --> 06:49.240
-Only two, honey?
-Really?

06:54.560 --> 06:56.360
Are you having trouble with your bike?

06:56.840 --> 06:58.840
Alexandre, take a good look at me, son.

07:00.200 --> 07:02.760
You know, you look different.

07:04.280 --> 07:05.840
You dyed your hair.

07:08.000 --> 07:11.080
Have you ever considered
that it could be the starter?

07:12.760 --> 07:14.840
Do you know anything about bikes?

07:16.800 --> 07:19.600
-No.
-Then shut up, man.

07:40.120 --> 07:43.720
Vané, I don't know how you can
put up with Mom and Dad every day.

07:43.800 --> 07:45.240
Honestly, I really don't know.

07:46.160 --> 07:47.560
It baffles me.

07:48.280 --> 07:50.160
And Mom is going completely senile.

07:51.040 --> 07:52.240
Someone has to do it.

07:53.320 --> 07:54.400
What?

07:54.960 --> 07:56.240
Take care of Mom and Dad.

07:58.440 --> 08:00.360
You've always been more stable than I.

08:02.160 --> 08:04.760
I was looking for cigarettes.
I thought I had some, but I don't.

08:06.800 --> 08:10.160
What? Do you think they would be okay
with me living in a two-bedroom flat

08:10.240 --> 08:12.880
in Bairro das Colónias
with one of my temporary husbands?

08:13.480 --> 08:15.720
If they were temporary,
why were they ever husbands?

08:16.240 --> 08:17.160
Because.

08:17.800 --> 08:21.160
Just because something is ephemeral,
there's no reason to avoid it.

08:21.240 --> 08:22.680
Look, on the contrary,

08:22.760 --> 08:24.200
since everything comes to an end,

08:24.280 --> 08:26.480
we should do
whatever gives us joy in the moment.

08:26.960 --> 08:28.680
That's life,
there's nothing wrong with it.

08:28.760 --> 08:30.600
Everything has an expiration date.

08:31.160 --> 08:34.400
This planet has an expiration date,
we have an expiration date.

08:35.120 --> 08:36.280
So do relationships.

08:37.200 --> 08:38.640
As you know very well, now.

08:42.880 --> 08:45.200
Have you decided how you're going to deal
with the breakup?

08:46.680 --> 08:48.840
With the farm, the business, our parents?

08:49.320 --> 08:51.880
We decided to give our marriage
another chance.

08:53.680 --> 08:55.560
-Are you sure?
-We'll try again.

08:58.120 --> 09:00.000
Vanessa, you're not doing this because--

09:00.080 --> 09:01.680
It's what's best for everyone.

09:08.040 --> 09:10.880
Look, here comes
your third temporary husband.

09:13.000 --> 09:17.160
Hey, girls, your parents are fascinating.

09:40.240 --> 09:41.200
So?

09:41.880 --> 09:43.520
Did you like your new son-in-law?

09:44.960 --> 09:46.640
He's very cheerful.

09:47.880 --> 09:50.440
See, that's a terrible fault indeed.

09:51.360 --> 09:52.720
Do you want help with that?

09:53.920 --> 09:54.880
You…

09:55.520 --> 09:56.720
You know anything about this?

09:56.800 --> 09:58.080
Of course I do.

09:58.160 --> 09:59.800
Listen, what do you have here?

10:01.680 --> 10:03.480
I'll put this wheel right here.

10:05.360 --> 10:06.360
There.

10:07.880 --> 10:10.160
I don't see you. Where are you?

10:11.880 --> 10:16.680
<i>Just cross Invention Avenue</i>
<i>and take the first right.</i>

10:23.760 --> 10:26.400
The first right
goes to the Orgasmic Center.

10:28.520 --> 10:29.720
<i>Sorry.</i>

10:29.800 --> 10:32.120
<i>Sorry, I meant second right.</i>

10:32.200 --> 10:35.120
Well, this virtual reality thing
is really amazing.

10:35.680 --> 10:37.280
It just seemed like…

10:37.360 --> 10:39.760
How do you pronounce
the name of this planet?

10:39.840 --> 10:42.120
<i>Pash-pash-guy what?</i>

10:42.680 --> 10:46.600
<i>It's basically impossible to pronounce.</i>
<i>I think that's the point, alien-like.</i>

10:46.680 --> 10:47.880
<i>Pashgeizter.</i>

10:47.960 --> 10:49.880
<i>It's easy once you get the hang of it.</i>

10:50.680 --> 10:52.000
<i>Are you nervous?</i>

10:53.240 --> 10:54.280
A little bit.

10:54.360 --> 10:57.280
<i>In the end, it's the first time</i>
<i>we'll be together in this reality.</i>

10:57.360 --> 10:58.880
<i>We no longer just text.</i>

10:58.960 --> 11:00.320
Are you an accountant?

11:01.360 --> 11:03.720
<i>It was the strangest thing</i>
<i>I could think of.</i>

11:05.760 --> 11:08.240
I still think we should meet in person.

11:09.440 --> 11:10.640
In the real world.

11:11.800 --> 11:14.480
<i>You already stood me up twice.</i>
<i>Third time's the charm.</i>

11:15.520 --> 11:17.960
I'm sorry, really, but with my thesis

11:18.040 --> 11:20.520
and my aunt's wedding,
I really have no time for anything.

11:22.280 --> 11:23.600
<i>It's okay, I'll show up.</i>

11:25.000 --> 11:26.160
You'll show up where?

11:26.680 --> 11:29.080
<i>At your aunt's wedding.</i>
<i>Didn't you say it was a masquerade?</i>

11:29.160 --> 11:32.360
<i>Then it's perfect.</i>
<i>Can you guess what I'll dress up as?</i>

11:35.040 --> 11:37.720
Hold that for a second. Hold it, hold it.

11:42.520 --> 11:43.480
Shit.

11:55.000 --> 11:56.040
Did you see it?

11:58.920 --> 12:01.560
No, I took out my contact lenses too.

12:15.480 --> 12:17.640
Forget that. Come on, come to bed.

12:23.760 --> 12:25.240
<i>"On Love."</i>

12:28.560 --> 12:29.800
I never read it. Is it good?

12:37.160 --> 12:42.640
"A tiny dose of hope is enough

12:43.720 --> 12:47.520
to give birth to love."

13:02.800 --> 13:04.800
Are you sure you want to do this?

13:22.240 --> 13:25.160
Stop it.

14:05.760 --> 14:07.240
My hero.

14:22.000 --> 14:23.920
Do you see the third floor over there?

14:25.280 --> 14:27.720
One of the best counterfeiters in Europe
lives there.

14:27.800 --> 14:28.920
A Danish girl.

14:29.520 --> 14:31.440
We have an informant who is her lover,

14:31.520 --> 14:34.880
and we were even able
to access some photo records.

14:35.600 --> 14:38.440
You gotta see it, it's jaw-dropping.

14:39.240 --> 14:41.520
Just duplicates of famous paintings
all over the walls.

14:41.600 --> 14:43.920
I mean, by artists who everyone knows.

14:44.000 --> 14:45.120
Like Picasso.

14:45.200 --> 14:47.800
They're all fake, of course,
but they're identical.

14:47.880 --> 14:49.920
I mean, exactly like the originals.

14:51.720 --> 14:52.800
Why don't they arrest her?

14:53.680 --> 14:55.280
The Federal Police are just fishing.

14:55.960 --> 14:57.520
Do you know what they do?

14:57.600 --> 14:59.320
They leave the bait in the water,

14:59.800 --> 15:01.840
and then they wait to see who bites it.

15:02.640 --> 15:05.080
Who buys is as important as who sells.

15:05.160 --> 15:08.320
They use the small fish
to catch the big ones.

15:08.920 --> 15:10.080
You know what the problem is?

15:10.640 --> 15:14.000
The problem is that they realized
there is a series of counterfeits

15:14.080 --> 15:16.000
scattered in museums around the world.

15:16.520 --> 15:20.720
Paintings that people pay
and line up to see for three seconds.

15:20.800 --> 15:24.880
I'm talking about pictures
that are at the top of those lists.

15:24.960 --> 15:28.560
Those lists when you
go sightseeing in a certain city.

15:29.280 --> 15:31.000
Now imagine if it gets out

15:31.080 --> 15:34.600
that all these counterfeits were done
by a Danish woman

15:34.680 --> 15:36.760
who lives in a lousy apartment in Lisbon.

15:37.480 --> 15:41.920
Charlie Chaplin entered a competition
to see who best impersonated Chaplin.

15:42.520 --> 15:43.680
No one knew it was him.

15:44.280 --> 15:45.520
He finished third.

15:47.400 --> 15:50.200
Sometimes it's hard to tell the difference
between the real and the fake,

15:50.280 --> 15:51.640
that's all I mean to say.

15:52.240 --> 15:54.760
In this case, is there even a difference?

15:54.840 --> 15:57.640
-They're exactly the same.
-No, they're not exactly the same.

15:57.720 --> 15:58.640
They're not.

15:59.200 --> 16:02.000
You're trying to complicate it.
It's either real or fake.

16:02.080 --> 16:04.640
Period. For me, things are very simple.

16:05.480 --> 16:07.400
-Things are very simple for you?
-Simple as water.

16:09.240 --> 16:11.840
-Simple as water?
-H2O, baby.

16:11.920 --> 16:14.560
Two hydrogen atoms, one oxygen--

16:14.640 --> 16:16.360
What are you talking about, dude?

16:17.320 --> 16:19.160
And why the hell did you bring me here?

16:19.720 --> 16:21.560
What is it? A tour of crime scenes?

16:22.200 --> 16:23.160
Where are we going next?

16:23.240 --> 16:26.840
To a villa in Restelo
where a triple homicide was committed?

16:27.560 --> 16:31.040
Wait a minute, you told me
you wanted to get to know me better.

16:31.120 --> 16:32.200
Right?

16:32.280 --> 16:34.320
If it was up to me,
we'd already be in a motel…

16:35.800 --> 16:37.000
and you'd already be undressed.

16:39.120 --> 16:40.440
Rita!

17:00.760 --> 17:03.240
Careful, it's getting cold.

17:03.720 --> 17:06.480
These hot nights are deceiving.
Don't get a cold.

17:34.920 --> 17:36.040
Let's go then.

17:37.920 --> 17:38.920
Where to?

17:39.000 --> 17:41.720
To that villa in Restelo
where a triple homicide was committed?

17:43.320 --> 17:45.680
No. To that motel.

18:23.520 --> 18:25.800
What are you doing, Luísa?

18:26.800 --> 18:28.080
I'm waiting.

18:29.400 --> 18:30.800
They are coming for me.

18:32.040 --> 18:33.440
Who's coming for you?

18:35.480 --> 18:36.960
I can't tell you.

18:38.400 --> 18:39.480
Why?

18:42.600 --> 18:43.640
Because it's…

18:44.520 --> 18:46.920
it's one of those things
I don't know how to say.

18:48.000 --> 18:49.760
Those things that you don't say.

18:50.760 --> 18:56.200
And you wouldn't understand, anyway.

18:57.000 --> 18:57.840
But…

18:58.440 --> 19:00.640
Since when don't I understand you, Luísa?

19:03.840 --> 19:06.600
I didn't realize when I found out.

19:08.160 --> 19:12.200
It was all so sudden.

19:15.440 --> 19:18.320
Would you like some company
while you wait?

19:22.120 --> 19:24.400
But you have to leave
before they get here.

19:46.280 --> 19:47.560
That's not them, is it?

19:52.960 --> 19:56.640
Of course not. What nonsense!

20:08.200 --> 20:09.040
Listen.

20:09.600 --> 20:10.640
Are you okay?

20:13.600 --> 20:16.640
You're lying. You're not okay.
Look at you, you're not okay.

20:19.400 --> 20:20.480
What do you want me to say?

20:22.320 --> 20:24.080
I like you, and you know that.

20:26.880 --> 20:28.120
What is it?

20:28.920 --> 20:31.640
I was always honest with you.
I never told you I'd leave her.

20:31.720 --> 20:34.800
But, look,
I never wanted you to leave her either.

20:36.440 --> 20:37.560
Simple as water.

20:38.440 --> 20:40.560
H2O, baby.

21:00.960 --> 21:02.040
Mom!

21:04.000 --> 21:04.920
Mom!

21:05.640 --> 21:07.320
Have you ever
found yourself doing something

21:07.400 --> 21:09.200
you really shouldn't,

21:09.280 --> 21:12.440
but you still do it over and over again

21:12.520 --> 21:14.480
just because it feels really good?

21:16.720 --> 21:18.160
How old are you?

21:25.400 --> 21:26.480
Hi, Dad.

21:27.640 --> 21:29.400
Twenty-five years old.

21:31.360 --> 21:35.960
For 25 years, I've pretended
that my dear and innocent daughter

21:36.040 --> 21:37.400
had no sex life.

21:39.840 --> 21:41.880
An illusion I just lost.

21:45.960 --> 21:48.800
I forgot that you and Mom
were giving it another go.

21:49.440 --> 21:50.760
It's going great, right?

21:55.680 --> 21:57.840
Twenty-five years.

22:04.920 --> 22:06.240
Hello, honey.

22:17.600 --> 22:18.800
Is everything all right?

22:27.360 --> 22:28.520
As I was saying…

22:29.760 --> 22:32.160
Have you ever
found yourself doing something

22:32.240 --> 22:34.200
that you know you shouldn't,

22:34.720 --> 22:37.680
but you still do it over and over again?

22:42.120 --> 22:43.800
Then why do you keep doing it?

22:47.720 --> 22:48.840
A bond.

22:50.240 --> 22:51.320
Chemistry.

22:51.400 --> 22:52.400
Pleasure.

22:54.160 --> 22:57.160
If there was a Rita Paixão
impersonator competition tomorrow,

22:57.240 --> 22:59.600
I doubt I would even finish third.

23:02.080 --> 23:03.040
What do you mean?

23:11.720 --> 23:13.280
<i>La Llorona.</i>

23:14.200 --> 23:16.040
I found that in the trash by accident.

23:17.000 --> 23:20.520
It was painted by a Danish counterfeiter
with melancholic eyes.

23:22.280 --> 23:24.040
I know what you're thinking.

23:24.120 --> 23:27.280
That the universe should be
more subtle with its messages.

23:28.160 --> 23:29.520
That's exactly the problem.

23:30.080 --> 23:33.560
The problem is that we all started
to pay attention to the world,

23:33.640 --> 23:35.720
to what surrounds us, and to its signs.

23:35.800 --> 23:38.560
And now this is what we get.
The universe won't shut up.

23:39.080 --> 23:40.520
It's under a lot of stress.

23:56.320 --> 23:57.920
How are things with Dad?

23:59.560 --> 24:00.400
Good.

24:02.800 --> 24:06.720
And yet you're here alone in the kitchen
in the middle of the night.

24:07.520 --> 24:10.320
I'm working on your aunt's wedding.

24:17.280 --> 24:18.880
I just want to do everything right.

24:19.960 --> 24:21.680
To make the right decisions.

24:24.080 --> 24:27.880
It's not easy to decide who sits where.

24:31.480 --> 24:34.120
It's true, it's not easy at all.

24:43.000 --> 24:45.200
-See you tomorrow.
-See you tomorrow.

25:37.240 --> 25:38.680
I think I'm in love.

25:40.040 --> 25:41.560
Who's the lucky one this time, Vasco?

25:42.520 --> 25:43.920
You're drawing her, man.

25:46.120 --> 25:47.920
Who? The old lady?

25:49.760 --> 25:50.880
Old lady?

25:51.760 --> 25:53.200
Did you take a good look at yourself?

25:54.880 --> 25:59.720
Okay, but it's different.
You girls represent youth and beauty,

26:00.520 --> 26:02.640
and we are just guys.

26:02.720 --> 26:04.680
Isn't that right, Vasco? We're just guys.

26:04.760 --> 26:08.720
Look, Chaplin had a son at the age of 73.

26:08.800 --> 26:10.120
Right, Vasco? We're just guys.

26:10.200 --> 26:16.400
We lose our hair, our erections, right?
This isn't easy for anyone.

26:17.000 --> 26:19.520
Time doesn't stop and death grows near.
What are we going to do?

26:21.320 --> 26:22.440
Take pictures?

26:23.920 --> 26:25.280
Paint?

26:26.680 --> 26:28.360
Come on, keep memories, right?

26:29.520 --> 26:30.840
And what else?

26:32.720 --> 26:37.400
The last time I was an inspiration to you,
you didn't make it through the outline.

26:37.480 --> 26:38.840
I looked like a ghost.

26:38.920 --> 26:39.960
Yeah.

26:40.680 --> 26:43.280
But now I can really look at you, and…

26:44.400 --> 26:47.000
I can see you, very well.

26:57.560 --> 26:59.200
What are we doing, Daniel?

27:00.160 --> 27:01.200
I don't know.

27:02.200 --> 27:03.280
Big help.

27:03.840 --> 27:05.800
No, I really don't know.

27:05.880 --> 27:07.280
We're in your fantasy.

27:07.840 --> 27:10.120
You're the one writing the script, right?

27:13.320 --> 27:14.320
Do you want one?

27:15.760 --> 27:18.600
Imaginary cigarettes
don't turn teeth yellow.

27:31.680 --> 27:35.120
The first time I came here,
when I met both of you…

27:37.080 --> 27:38.320
I didn't open my mouth.

27:42.600 --> 27:46.680
I just posed naked for you,

27:48.080 --> 27:51.360
and I let you draw what you wanted to see.

27:57.240 --> 28:00.320
It was always easier
to follow the instructions.

28:02.840 --> 28:07.080
You're pregnant,
stay with the child's father.

28:08.520 --> 28:11.560
You work together, you stay together.

28:12.440 --> 28:13.920
Things are fragile.

28:15.560 --> 28:16.960
Don't move.

28:18.520 --> 28:22.240
Maybe this way
you won't compromise anything.

28:26.080 --> 28:27.400
You can trust me.

28:28.440 --> 28:32.560
I'll never tell anyone
that your favorite movie is <i>Dirty Dancing.</i>

28:34.040 --> 28:37.560
Now the right answer was, of course,
that wasn't my favorite movie.

28:39.000 --> 28:42.080
But is it worth arguing
with my subconscious? No.

28:52.320 --> 28:54.760
Yes, but that's because
you're not a baby anymore, baby.

28:57.840 --> 28:58.880
I finished it.

29:00.880 --> 29:04.600
Hey, man, it looks a lot like her.

29:06.240 --> 29:07.240
Very good.

29:07.920 --> 29:09.800
It's just like her, really like her.

29:09.880 --> 29:10.800
Show me.

29:13.280 --> 29:14.560
I could see her.

29:14.640 --> 29:16.640
It looks a lot like you,
doesn't it, Vanessa?

29:17.320 --> 29:19.920
Doesn't it, Vanessa?
It's very… It's like you.

29:20.000 --> 29:24.120
Doable. Really good. Incredible.

29:29.920 --> 29:32.560
<i>Another whistle</i>

29:40.000 --> 29:41.000
Did you sleep well?

30:04.760 --> 30:05.640
Good morning.

30:05.720 --> 30:06.800
Good morning.

30:19.280 --> 30:21.320
<i>I live upside down</i>

30:21.400 --> 30:24.400
<i>You're right</i>

30:26.200 --> 30:27.640
<i>Not going up</i>

30:28.880 --> 30:34.240
Is it just me
or is that accountant looking at us?

30:35.520 --> 30:36.800
Sunflower is fertility, right?

30:36.880 --> 30:39.760
No. Carnation is fertility,
sunflower is vitality.

30:39.840 --> 30:41.280
Then, great.

30:42.840 --> 30:45.120
The red rose is passion.

30:45.200 --> 30:46.400
We want lots of them.

30:47.440 --> 30:51.080
With all those bouquets, it's best
to grind the flowers and make a smoothie.

30:52.680 --> 30:57.080
There's a theory
that comes from the Middle Ages.

30:57.160 --> 30:59.240
Brides used them to cover up their odor,

30:59.320 --> 31:01.520
because not even on their wedding day
would they bathe.

31:04.120 --> 31:05.720
For you, sis.

31:07.160 --> 31:09.680
-It will be a beautiful bouquet.
-Thank you.

31:12.840 --> 31:14.120
Thank you, sis.

31:15.840 --> 31:17.720
-Are you happy?
-Very happy.

31:19.000 --> 31:21.320
It seems so easy for you to be happy.

31:21.400 --> 31:22.520
I envy you.

31:22.600 --> 31:24.240
You deserve to be happy too, Vanessa.

31:25.440 --> 31:28.720
You talk about happiness
like it's a prize you give someone.

31:28.800 --> 31:33.640
Why? We're on the happiness committee
and we've been analyzing your application,

31:33.720 --> 31:36.080
and although you don't
meet the requirements,

31:36.160 --> 31:38.520
-we consider--
-Sis, forget that shit for a second.

31:38.600 --> 31:40.040
You could be just glad.

31:40.120 --> 31:42.040
And listen to what I'm saying.

31:42.120 --> 31:43.560
You also deserve to be happy.

31:44.800 --> 31:46.080
I heard you the first time.

31:48.120 --> 31:50.120
I don't know
what I'm going to dress up as.

31:51.680 --> 31:53.680
-I might have an idea.
-What?

31:53.760 --> 31:54.840
Come.

31:56.640 --> 31:58.160
It's going to be great.

31:58.240 --> 32:02.680
<i>Dust on my foot, blue sky</i>

32:03.600 --> 32:07.000
<i>I won't change the sunset</i>

32:07.080 --> 32:10.840
<i>In the skin, I'm from the South</i>

32:10.920 --> 32:15.120
<i>My cream is your salt</i>

32:15.200 --> 32:17.600
<i>Come here and see it</i>

32:18.800 --> 32:21.680
<i>Melting</i>

32:24.240 --> 32:28.600
<i>Until the end</i>

32:35.840 --> 32:36.760
Who are you?

32:36.840 --> 32:40.520
-Frank Sinatra.
-Amália Rodrigues.

32:41.520 --> 32:42.480
Zombie.

32:44.480 --> 32:45.920
Where do you know my daughter from?

32:46.000 --> 32:48.120
I drove them the night they met.

32:49.200 --> 32:52.280
You could tell right away
that there was a very strong bond.

32:52.360 --> 32:54.360
Very strong.
There was even a time that I thought

32:54.440 --> 32:57.000
-the two of them were going to--
-Look, spare me the details.

32:57.680 --> 32:59.880
And where is Vanessa?

33:01.760 --> 33:05.080
<i>Melting</i>

33:07.000 --> 33:11.840
<i>Until the end</i>

33:13.480 --> 33:18.280
<i>When the morning breeze is gone</i>

33:20.600 --> 33:27.520
<i>When the sound of the waves fades away</i>

33:27.600 --> 33:29.520
<i>When the night doesn't want to…</i>

33:29.600 --> 33:32.640
It's unbearably hot, it's impossible.

33:33.480 --> 33:35.800
-Yes, it's very appropriate.
-Shut up, bear.

33:36.400 --> 33:37.400
Where is Mom?

33:38.160 --> 33:39.560
Mom went to get dressed.

33:39.640 --> 33:42.560
She went to put on her mask,
but she didn't come back. I don't know.

33:42.640 --> 33:43.960
What is Mom dressing up as?

33:44.040 --> 33:45.880
I don't know, she didn't want to tell me.

33:48.280 --> 33:50.440
-Let's take a picture?
-Okay.

33:57.480 --> 33:59.600
Is it just me, or is that accountant

33:59.680 --> 34:02.240
looking at us in a slightly strange way?

34:07.480 --> 34:08.960
No, I don't know who that is.

34:10.560 --> 34:11.760
He's waving.

34:13.440 --> 34:15.680
He may be waving at anyone. I don't know.

34:16.360 --> 34:17.480
Marco.

34:18.720 --> 34:19.840
It could be any Marco.

34:26.240 --> 34:27.280
Honey.

34:28.360 --> 34:31.280
About what happened the other night, I…

34:31.360 --> 34:32.960
I apologize for my reaction.

34:33.560 --> 34:36.800
I want you to know
that you can talk to me about everything.

34:38.200 --> 34:39.120
Everything.

34:42.520 --> 34:44.080
Is the accountant still waving?

34:44.560 --> 34:47.120
No, but here comes the bride.

34:47.200 --> 34:52.240
<i>When the night doesn't want to sleep</i>

34:54.400 --> 35:01.080
<i>I'll go with you</i>

35:01.160 --> 35:08.160
<i>I'll go with you</i>

35:13.880 --> 35:15.600
How beautiful!

35:24.360 --> 35:27.760
<i>Come here and see</i>

35:27.840 --> 35:30.960
<i>Melting</i>

35:33.000 --> 35:37.800
<i>Until the end</i>

35:39.240 --> 35:43.680
<i>When the morning breeze is gone</i>

35:46.000 --> 35:52.520
<i>When the sound of the waves fades away</i>

35:53.120 --> 35:58.000
<i>When the night doesn't want to sleep</i>

36:00.120 --> 36:06.720
<i>I'll go with you</i>

36:06.800 --> 36:13.240
<i>I'll go with you</i>

36:13.920 --> 36:20.080
<i>I'll go with you</i>

36:20.720 --> 36:27.080
<i>I'll go with you</i>

36:31.040 --> 36:32.120
Marco.

36:33.080 --> 36:34.160
Marco, really!

36:34.840 --> 36:35.840
Marco.

36:40.480 --> 36:43.440
Honestly, I don't know anymore
how many people I've married.

36:45.480 --> 36:47.040
People like to talk,

36:47.880 --> 36:50.160
to say bad things about bureaucracy.

36:50.920 --> 36:52.320
But think about it.

36:52.400 --> 36:55.160
Think about what a world
without notaries would be like.

36:57.920 --> 36:59.680
I am thinking.

37:00.440 --> 37:01.800
Are you thinking?

37:03.200 --> 37:04.160
Horrible!

37:04.240 --> 37:05.640
It would be horrible!

37:08.920 --> 37:10.760
Unsigned contracts everywhere.

37:11.520 --> 37:13.920
Forced to depend on other people's word.

37:15.080 --> 37:17.480
How many friendships would collapse?

37:22.640 --> 37:25.840
Do you know that
I happen to have a thing for priests?

37:27.800 --> 37:29.920
Spiritual peace turns you on?

37:30.600 --> 37:31.640
No.

37:31.720 --> 37:34.120
I think
it's more the forbidden fruit thing.

37:34.200 --> 37:36.440
Look, if you want some privacy,
just say so.

37:37.320 --> 37:39.720
-Let's commit a sin.
-Yes, Miss.

37:48.400 --> 37:49.680
Marco, why are you running away?

37:50.560 --> 37:52.120
-I'm not running away.
-What?

37:52.200 --> 37:53.440
You invited yourself…

37:53.520 --> 37:55.320
Sorry, I can't understand you.

37:57.600 --> 37:59.960
You invited yourself.
I didn't tell you to come.

38:00.480 --> 38:03.000
You should have known that I was kidding.
What did you think?

38:03.080 --> 38:05.760
That you'd come here to the real world
and what? I don't understand.

38:05.840 --> 38:06.800
No.

38:06.880 --> 38:09.320
I don't know, I just thought
we could meet in person.

38:09.400 --> 38:10.600
I thought it made sense.

38:12.480 --> 38:13.560
Right.

38:13.640 --> 38:15.440
Who told you I wanted to meet you?

38:17.320 --> 38:18.920
You didn't say otherwise either.

38:19.000 --> 38:20.480
Yes, but I jumped off a canyon.

38:20.560 --> 38:23.280
I thought that gesture was enlightening,
but apparently not.

38:23.360 --> 38:25.840
You're getting in the way
of my day's work.

38:27.400 --> 38:28.520
We're on planet Earth.

38:29.160 --> 38:32.560
Okay? We're not on the planet Pascby
or something I can't pronounce.

38:32.640 --> 38:33.920
-Pashgeizter.
-That's it.

38:37.000 --> 38:38.760
Look, I'm sorry.

38:59.320 --> 39:02.160
I can still taste you
on the tip of my tongue

39:03.040 --> 39:04.200
Honey.

39:04.960 --> 39:06.200
No, leave it, leave…

39:11.520 --> 39:12.800
The music stopped?

39:14.680 --> 39:16.280
I'll check… I'll check the…

39:20.000 --> 39:21.760
Hey, what's going on?

39:21.840 --> 39:24.360
We have no lead singer.
I'll try to find out what happened.

39:24.440 --> 39:25.480
All right.

39:25.560 --> 39:26.720
Is the music over?

39:26.800 --> 39:29.800
Sorry, Aunt. I'm looking for Vanda,
I'll look for her…

39:30.520 --> 39:31.480
Marco!

39:31.560 --> 39:33.880
Marco, did you see Vanda from the band?

39:35.000 --> 39:35.960
Marco, shit!

39:36.040 --> 39:39.080
Sorry, I don't know.
I'll look for her, sorry.

39:43.160 --> 39:44.280
Sis.

39:45.440 --> 39:46.320
This one is for you.

40:01.480 --> 40:07.640
<i>There's so much left unsaid</i>

40:09.600 --> 40:14.000
<i>When I leave</i>

40:15.840 --> 40:18.520
<i>The bonds are</i>

40:19.240 --> 40:23.800
<i>Made of concrete and I</i>

40:24.640 --> 40:29.120
<i>I try not to give in</i>

40:30.760 --> 40:34.840
<i>If I want you now</i>

40:36.920 --> 40:39.520
<i>I pretend another mission</i>

40:40.640 --> 40:45.840
<i>To give you my hand</i>

40:46.760 --> 40:50.400
<i>I'm staying at this stop</i>

40:50.480 --> 40:52.960
<i>Yes</i>

40:53.720 --> 40:59.520
<i>Save your next trip for me</i>

41:00.200 --> 41:04.920
<i>There is love if there is a will</i>

41:05.000 --> 41:08.480
<i>Make me miss you no more</i>

41:10.200 --> 41:16.360
<i>I expect another sun to rise</i>

41:18.320 --> 41:22.440
<i>Maybe it evaporates</i>

41:24.560 --> 41:27.520
<i>That ice attracts</i>

41:27.600 --> 41:32.200
<i>But it burns those who don't take care</i>

41:33.440 --> 41:37.640
<i>Too bad you don't want to see</i>

41:39.360 --> 41:44.120
<i>But I have all my life</i>

41:46.000 --> 41:48.640
<i>To convince you</i>

41:49.400 --> 41:54.680
<i>To be whoever you want to be</i>

41:55.720 --> 42:00.840
<i>I'm staying at this stop, yes</i>

42:02.760 --> 42:07.800
<i>Save your next trip for me</i>

42:07.880 --> 42:08.960
Pashgeizter.

42:09.640 --> 42:15.840
<i>That there is love if there is a will</i>

42:16.880 --> 42:22.080
<i>I'm staying at this stop, yes</i>

42:23.480 --> 42:29.080
<i>Save your next trip for me</i>

42:30.040 --> 42:34.640
<i>That there is love if there is a will</i>

42:34.720 --> 42:39.480
<i>Make me miss you no more</i>

42:45.880 --> 42:47.000
Thank you.
