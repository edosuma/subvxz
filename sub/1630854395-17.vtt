<i>How's Churro looking,
Dr. Pocha?</i>

00:08.550 --> 00:10.343
Does she have
a hearing problem,

00:10.343 --> 00:13.304
or is she a mean girl
playing mind games?

00:15.306 --> 00:16.516
Let's test it out

00:16.516 --> 00:19.352
with a basic
canine auditory assessment.

00:19.352 --> 00:22.355
Hey, Churro, can you hear me?

00:23.565 --> 00:24.482
Kidding.

00:24.482 --> 00:26.443
I did a cochlear exam earlier,

00:26.443 --> 00:30.655
and Churro has hearing loss
because she's an old woman.

00:31.573 --> 00:35.326
Nana says it's not polite
to discuss a lady's age,

00:35.326 --> 00:37.662
unless she's a sucia.

00:39.956 --> 00:41.750
Then all bets are off.

00:42.959 --> 00:44.544
I knew she wasn't a puppy,

00:44.544 --> 00:46.546
but seven seems too young
for hearing loss.

00:46.546 --> 00:49.591
It is,
but 15 is right on track.

00:49.591 --> 00:51.718
She's 15?

00:51.718 --> 00:54.763
That's the most important year
in a young Latina dog's life.

00:54.763 --> 00:57.515
We should throw her
a quinceañera.

00:57.515 --> 01:00.310
Yes,
like my friend Seymour Bloom

01:00.310 --> 01:02.729
threw his schnauzer
a bark-mitzvah.

01:04.564 --> 01:07.901
The gefilte fish
was to die for.

01:07.901 --> 01:09.736
It will be so fun.

01:09.736 --> 01:12.989
We can rent a venue,
choreograph dances,

01:12.989 --> 01:17.869
and put Churro in a poofy dress
with four tiny high heels.

01:17.869 --> 01:22.290
That all sounds so crazy.

01:22.290 --> 01:24.668
Not if we put it on TikTok.

01:24.668 --> 01:26.711
It will be good publicity
for the vet's office.

01:26.711 --> 01:29.339
I love crazy.

01:29.339 --> 01:31.424
We could even partner
with East LA Shelter

01:31.424 --> 01:33.510
and feature dogs
that need to be adopted.

01:33.510 --> 01:35.720

for a dog that was found
in a porta-potty.

03:27.707 --> 03:29.834
The whole point
is to promote the clinic,

and end the night

03:31.795 --> 03:33.880
