Alas! Poor Yorick.

03:02.982 --> 03:04.574
I knew him, Horatio.

03:04.751 --> 03:09.586
A fellow of infinite jest,
of most excellent fancy.

03:10.056 --> 03:13.287
He hath borne me on his back
a thousand times,

03:13.426 --> 03:16.452
and now, how abhorred
in my imagination it is!

This is
a private party, miss.

03:38.284 --> 03:41.515
My name is Gwen Conliffe,
and I'm engaged to your brother, Ben.

03:42.555 --> 03:43.852
Is Ben here?

03:44.757 --> 03:45.724
No.

03:47.560 --> 03:51.519
I'm afraid no one knows where Ben is,
which is why I'm here.

03:55.568 --> 03:56.762
Clive.

04:00.807 --> 04:06.473
Well, boys and girls,
let's repair to the tavern!

04:14.153 --> 04:16.053
Good night, sweet prince.

04:16.589 --> 04:19.615
I seem to recall,
Miss Conliffe...

04:36.376 --> 04:39.402
I seem to recall he mentioned
you in one of his letters.

04:40.013 --> 04:41.878
And it's quite uncharacteristic of my brother

04:41.981 --> 04:44.006
to treat a lady
in such a way,

04:44.150 --> 04:48.246
but the character of man
is such a shiftable thing.

04:48.388 --> 04:52.119
You misapprehend me.
Benjamin is missing from Blackmoor.

04:52.225 --> 04:53.192
He's gone.

04:54.527 --> 04:56.256
Did my father send you?

04:56.396 --> 04:58.159
No, I'm here on my own.

04:58.364 --> 05:01.629
It's been nearly a month
since anyone has seen Ben,

05:01.734 --> 05:03.998
and we knew that
you were in London.

05:05.238 --> 05:07.729
I'd hoped you had
received some word.

05:07.840 --> 05:09.603
Why do you think
he's in trouble?

05:09.709 --> 05:14.043
Because the night he went missing,
two villagers were killed.

05:15.181 --> 05:16.614
Would you help us?

05:17.817 --> 05:19.478
Miss Conliffe,

05:20.186 --> 05:23.622
I am under contract
for the next 30 performances.

05:23.856 --> 05:27.690
If this is about your father,
I know how you feel.

05:28.695 --> 05:29.662
Do you?

05:34.767 --> 05:37.429
My company leaves
for America tomorrow.

05:38.304 --> 05:40.602
I simply can't help.

05:41.741 --> 05:43.470
He is your brother.

05:44.277 --> 05:45.642
Good night.

05:51.984 --> 05:53.713
It must be
a wonderful luxury,

05:53.820 --> 05:56.914
doing battle with imaginary demons,
Mr. Talbot.

05:57.990 --> 06:00.220
Mine right now are very real.

06:57.950 --> 06:59.383
Your mother?

07:05.024 --> 07:05.991
Yes.

07:07.059 --> 07:09.653
My oldest memories
of my mother,

07:09.829 --> 07:12.957
we are gathering grapes
in her father's vineyard.

07:13.599 --> 07:15.726
It is my Garden of Eden.

07:16.436 --> 07:18.301
You're paying yours a visit?

07:18.671 --> 07:22.300
No, my mother died not long
after this was made.

07:23.276 --> 07:27.508
My father and my brother,
they live near Blackmoor.

07:34.220 --> 07:36.745
A man needs
a good stick on the moor.

07:37.924 --> 07:42.418
I purchased this one
in Gévaudan lifetimes ago.

07:43.396 --> 07:45.887
It's the work of
a master silversmith.

07:47.733 --> 07:49.496
Would you do me the honor?

07:56.409 --> 07:57.706
It's beautiful.

07:57.810 --> 07:59.505
It will give me
great pleasure to know that

07:59.612 --> 08:02.638
it was the keeping
of a civilized man.

08:03.182 --> 08:08.347
Its heft is somewhat
too much for me these days.

08:09.255 --> 08:11.223
You're overly kind.

08:12.992 --> 08:15.392
But I'm afraid
I must refuse it.

08:16.662 --> 08:18.220

has disappeared.

in any which way I can.

Yes, what a splendid idea, Lawrence.
A splendid idea.

11:34.176 --> 11:36.041
Too late,
I'm afraid.

11:36.144 --> 11:37.941
Unfortunately,
your brother's body

11:38.046 --> 11:42.278
was found in a ditch by the
priory road yesterday morning.

to wear for the funeral.

Someone who bore a grudge
against one of these men.

13:48.610 --> 13:51.545
To misdirect the authorities,
he kills the men,

13:51.646 --> 13:53.136
and then he
tears up the bodies

13:53.248 --> 13:55.375

beast was responsible.

14:19.241 --> 14:22.074
They show up,
and two weeks later this happens!

14:22.177 --> 14:25.112
My guess is Ben Talbot
went to their camp

14:25.213 --> 14:27.181
to have it off
with a gypsy whore.

14:27.616 --> 14:28.776

hold of him,

with the gypsies.

And, Quinn,
the look on his face.

14:52.057 --> 14:54.116
Like he'd been
eaten alive.

14:55.360 --> 14:59.888
Whatever did it
was big, had claws,

14:59.998 --> 15:02.091
and didn't mind
a load of buckshot.

15:02.868 --> 15:09.205
After that, me Pa went home and
melted down me Ma's wedding spoons

15:10.175 --> 15:12.473
and cast silver bullets
on them.

15:14.713 --> 15:19.707

that the telegraph system does reach
us here in Ionely old Blackmoor.

17:33.118 --> 17:36.281
Do you find your home
much changed, Mr. Talbot?

17:39.024 --> 17:41.959
Blackmoor does seem
rather the same as I left it.

17:42.194 --> 17:43.593
How so?

17:44.129 --> 17:47.929
The villagers,
they still have the same wild ideas.

17:48.033 --> 17:52.094
Yes, well, they're a provincial lot,

quite strange, Father.

You know, Lawrence,
I've never understood what it is that you do,

18:44.256 --> 18:46.417
pretending to be
other people.

18:46.658 --> 18:49.991
But I understand you're highly
celebrated and famous for it.

18:50.329 --> 18:53.321
Perhaps one day I'll see for
myself what all the fuss is about.

I think your mother
would've liked that.

your question?

19:15.120 --> 19:17.588
What kind of animal
could have done such a thing?

19:17.989 --> 19:21.015

bear and a Bengal tiger,

19:21.259 --> 19:23.727
nature at its most vicious,

19:23.929 --> 19:26.454
but I must say,
I've never seen anything like this.

19:28.300 --> 19:30.825
People in town say
it was a man.

19:30.969 --> 19:32.095
(CHUCKLES)

19:33.739 --> 19:36.367
You mean a raving lunatic
at loose on the moor?

19:36.641 --> 19:39.906
Yes, it's possible, but I think I would
have run him down with my dogs.

19:40.946 --> 19:43.039
On the other hand,

19:43.615 --> 19:46.413
the wounds are so terrible
that only something human

19:46.518 --> 19:49.419
would seem capable
of such wanton malevolence.

19:50.088 --> 19:53.023
I found a strange medallion
among Ben's belongings.

19:54.025 --> 19:58.121
Yes, Saint Columbanus.
He was an Eastern saint.

19:58.497 --> 20:00.260
He was also a gypsy.

20:01.066 --> 20:03.728
So did Ben have dealings
with the gypsies?

20:06.238 --> 20:10.607
Yes, he was our negotiator.

20:11.209 --> 20:12.938
The local gentry
would pay a fee,

20:13.044 --> 20:16.741
and the gypsies would keep their
criminal activities to a minimum.

20:17.616 --> 20:23.111
And they would move on once they'd
sold the local lads all the wine

20:23.221 --> 20:25.951
and dark-haired ladies
they could stand.

20:33.999 --> 20:38.459

doesn't she?

20:59.691 --> 21:03.092
Never look back, Lawrence.
Never look back.
