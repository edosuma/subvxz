00:01.702 --> 00:02.736
Previously on Limitless...
MIKE: We give him the pill
once a day.

00:02.770 --> 00:05.639
It enhances his cognition.

00:05.673 --> 00:07.641
Five NZT pills.
What are those for?

00:07.675 --> 00:08.576
Whatever you want.

00:08.609 --> 00:10.144
I might have a few extra

00:10.178 --> 00:11.379
NZT pills, my own stash.

00:11.412 --> 00:13.414
We are gonna talk
about this later.

00:13.447 --> 00:14.248
BRIAN:
Pretty tidy

00:14.282 --> 00:15.316
stitch job.

00:15.349 --> 00:16.717
RACHEL:
The FBI teach you that?

00:16.750 --> 00:18.452
Yes, it did.

00:18.486 --> 00:19.720
Rach, I really mean it

00:19.753 --> 00:22.056
when I say don't tell anyone
about this, okay?

00:22.090 --> 00:23.391
Not anyone, ever.

00:23.424 --> 00:25.659
BRIAN:
Sands killed Rebecca's father.

00:25.693 --> 00:27.295
I couldn't help my father.

00:27.328 --> 00:28.796
Maybe I can help you.

00:28.829 --> 00:31.165
Just don't lie to me. Ever.

00:35.703 --> 00:39.273
BRIAN: "I want to wake up
in the city that never sleeps."

00:39.307 --> 00:42.176
Frank Sinatra once sang that,
and now it's clichГ©.

00:42.210 --> 00:43.577
But when things get bad--

00:43.611 --> 00:45.346
and I would say
that living with the knowledge

00:45.379 --> 00:47.681
Sands killed Rebecca's father
qualifies as bad--

00:47.715 --> 00:50.284
it's comforting to know
that I can walk out any door,

00:50.318 --> 00:53.587
any hour of the night,
and New York is still going.

00:53.621 --> 00:56.757
Plenty to keep
an NZT-enhanced mind occupied.

00:56.790 --> 00:58.559
That's kind of how
I wound up here.

00:58.592 --> 01:00.161
(speaking Farsi)

01:00.194 --> 01:01.829
Beard.

01:01.862 --> 01:02.896
Beard. The guy had a beard?

01:02.930 --> 01:06.500
No. He's saying the guy had
a neck tattoo. FBI.

01:06.534 --> 01:10.104
Uh, do you have
a sketch artist on hand?

01:10.138 --> 01:12.840
Yeah. Marty?

01:12.873 --> 01:15.209
Hey, Marty. Do you mind
if I take a stab at this?

01:15.243 --> 01:17.245
Thanks very much.

01:20.614 --> 01:23.284
BRIAN:
I know what you're doing.

01:24.852 --> 01:27.355
Brian Finch,
not the hero the people want,

01:27.388 --> 01:28.656
or need for that matter.

01:28.689 --> 01:30.491
What are you even
doing out here?

01:30.524 --> 01:32.226
I'm about to close this case.

01:32.260 --> 01:33.627
Look, I get it.
You're good at this.

01:33.661 --> 01:34.762
And you may like
that doing good

01:34.795 --> 01:36.530
helps you forget
all the bad.

01:36.564 --> 01:38.766
But you know what
you're really doing?

01:38.799 --> 01:41.135
Is ducking a bunch of trouble
that's gonna find you anyway.

01:41.169 --> 01:43.171
(phone ringing)

01:49.310 --> 01:52.313
You're gonna have to lie
to her sooner or later.

01:52.346 --> 01:54.715
MAN: You're pretty good
at that, huh?

01:54.748 --> 01:56.116
Yeah.

01:58.786 --> 01:59.853
(speaking Farsi)

01:59.887 --> 02:02.122
There you go.

02:04.958 --> 02:08.229
DISPATCHER: We got a 10-10,
body of a male in his 20s

02:08.262 --> 02:09.430
found in Grand Ferry Park.

02:09.463 --> 02:11.232
All units please respond.

02:11.265 --> 02:13.534
(camera clicking,
helicopter passing overhead)

02:19.740 --> 02:22.510
(crunching)

02:22.543 --> 02:24.245
Are you eating Funyuns?

02:25.413 --> 02:27.515
Doesn't that defy
the rules of...

02:27.548 --> 02:29.250
You're not the only
rebel tonight.

02:29.283 --> 02:30.784
This whole avoiding
Rebecca thing...

02:30.818 --> 02:32.253
Dude.

02:32.286 --> 02:34.255
What am I supposed to do?

02:34.288 --> 02:37.291
You know, when I'm around her,
all I can think about is

02:37.325 --> 02:39.793
how I know
that Sands murdered her dad.

02:39.827 --> 02:41.795
That the person
who killed him is the same one

02:41.829 --> 02:43.797
keeping me alive.

02:43.831 --> 02:46.434
But can I tell her that? No.
No.

02:46.467 --> 02:48.802
Because that would mean
you would have to tell Rebecca

02:48.836 --> 02:50.938
that you are Senator Morra's
mole in the FBI.

02:50.971 --> 02:52.773
Which means losing,
let's see,

02:52.806 --> 02:55.409
the enzyme and your immunity.

02:55.443 --> 02:56.677
(chuckles)

02:56.710 --> 02:58.779
And my freedom, my life.

02:58.812 --> 03:01.449
And even if you found some way
to dodge all that,

03:01.482 --> 03:02.983
you'd have to go back to being

03:03.016 --> 03:04.552
just Brian.

03:04.585 --> 03:05.853
Hey.
And let's face it.

03:05.886 --> 03:07.455
You'd miss me,

03:07.488 --> 03:09.490
wouldn't you?

03:10.991 --> 03:14.962
So I'm telling you,
pushing Rebecca away

03:14.995 --> 03:16.630
is not the way
to handle this.

03:16.664 --> 03:18.866
That's not what I'm doing.
(phone ringing)

03:21.335 --> 03:22.270
Dude.

03:22.303 --> 03:24.738
You can ignore her,
but you can't ignore me.

03:31.312 --> 03:32.580
(sniffles)

03:34.682 --> 03:37.751
Huh. That's weird.

03:40.053 --> 03:41.922
Hmm.

03:47.528 --> 03:50.698
Did you find something?
Yeah.

03:50.731 --> 03:52.500
This is a city
government-issued key.

03:52.533 --> 03:54.668
How do you know?

03:54.702 --> 03:56.870
One time, I memorized the whole
NYC government directory online.

03:56.904 --> 03:59.373
And that key
starts with a nine-seven,

03:59.407 --> 04:01.542
which is the Department
of Buildings,

04:01.575 --> 04:03.611
followed by a one,
which specifically means

04:03.644 --> 04:06.480
the Manhattan
Permit Approvals Office.

04:06.514 --> 04:09.850
So, maybe you should move
your investigation there.

04:11.852 --> 04:14.788
BRIAN: Let's just say
it was a very productive night.

04:16.790 --> 04:18.726
While the energy of the city
temporarily

04:18.759 --> 04:22.896
took my mind off things,
I was right.

04:22.930 --> 04:24.898
Or the other Brian was right.

04:24.932 --> 04:27.000
I knew I couldn't avoid
Rebecca forever.

04:32.906 --> 04:35.409
My subconscious
just wouldn't let me.

04:35.443 --> 04:37.044
Brian, what the hell?!

04:37.077 --> 04:40.013
Never mind.

04:40.047 --> 04:41.482
I know people
at the NYPD.

04:41.515 --> 04:43.050
You think that they're
not gonna tell me

04:43.083 --> 04:45.419
my consultant is running
around flashing his badge?

04:45.453 --> 04:46.654
Well...

04:46.687 --> 04:47.988
Why haven't you been
answering my calls?

04:48.021 --> 04:49.022
Well, my phone's dead.

04:49.056 --> 04:50.458
(phone ringing)

04:50.491 --> 04:51.592
That's weird.

04:54.428 --> 04:56.997
Are you on NZT
when you're off-duty?

04:57.030 --> 04:59.066
We've talked
about this.

04:59.099 --> 05:01.335
Well, technically,
I am working, Rebecca.

05:01.369 --> 05:03.003
I'm just not working for you.

05:03.036 --> 05:04.405
Whoa.

05:04.438 --> 05:05.639
Look over there.
Nice try.

05:05.673 --> 05:08.342
Not gonna work.
No, no, I'm serious.

05:08.376 --> 05:09.677
(electrical crackling)

05:09.710 --> 05:10.844
What's going on?

05:10.878 --> 05:12.880
(people murmuring)

05:20.454 --> 05:23.457
*

05:45.413 --> 05:46.914
WOMAN (over P.A.):
Emergency generators are in use.

05:46.947 --> 05:48.015
Please conserve all power.

05:48.048 --> 05:50.718
Mike. What, are you hitting
me with a pick-me-up?

05:50.751 --> 05:52.820
Yup. We're assembling
in the bullpen.

05:52.853 --> 05:54.522
Be right there.

05:56.890 --> 05:57.958
(ding)

05:57.991 --> 05:59.860
You're gonna double
your dose?

05:59.893 --> 06:01.495
Listen, I really
appreciate you

06:01.529 --> 06:03.063
not saying anything
to... you know.

06:03.096 --> 06:05.533
We are gonna talk
about this.

06:05.566 --> 06:08.669
NAZ: We have two distinct
areas that are currently

06:08.702 --> 06:09.870
affected by the blackout.

06:09.903 --> 06:13.407
The Financial District took
the first hit at 0400 hours.

06:13.441 --> 06:15.443
Authorities are dealing
with the usual mess--

06:15.476 --> 06:18.178
people trapped in
subways, elevators,

06:18.211 --> 06:19.179
as well as the what-ifs.

06:19.212 --> 06:21.415
You know, what if
the backup generator fails

06:21.449 --> 06:22.616
and the hospitals go dark

06:22.650 --> 06:25.653
or the cell tower goes down
or the water stops running?

06:25.686 --> 06:26.854
So, in the northeast...

06:28.856 --> 06:30.491
Lightning bolt emoji.

06:57.017 --> 06:58.619
Pea soup emoji.

07:09.663 --> 07:11.198
Middle finger emoji.
Jackass.

07:11.231 --> 07:13.467
NAZ: You're here because
we have to acknowledge

07:13.501 --> 07:16.837
that the blackout hit our
financial lifeline first.

07:16.870 --> 07:19.607
Cyber is working on an
angle that countries like

07:19.640 --> 07:21.041
China and Russia
are powerful enough

07:21.074 --> 07:22.643
to actually launch
a cyber attack

07:22.676 --> 07:24.978
that will basically knock us
back to the Dark Ages.

07:25.012 --> 07:26.113
BRIAN:
Mm, yeah.

07:26.146 --> 07:27.481
I don't know.

07:27.515 --> 07:29.650
Brian, you have a thought.

07:29.683 --> 07:30.584
I do.

07:30.618 --> 07:31.885
As a matter of fact, um,

07:31.919 --> 07:33.587
while we still have power,

07:33.621 --> 07:36.590
I'd like to propose
an alternative offender.

07:36.624 --> 07:38.258
Come on up.

07:38.291 --> 07:39.527
Okay.

07:42.963 --> 07:44.898
So, uh, dark red indicates
our city's

07:44.932 --> 07:46.033
highest level of
energy consumption.

07:46.066 --> 07:47.501
The largest
consumer being

07:47.535 --> 07:48.769
here and here.

07:48.802 --> 07:50.170
Now, even though
these two areas seem

07:50.203 --> 07:51.639
geographically disparate,

07:51.672 --> 07:54.041
they are, in fact,
connected by the wind.

07:54.074 --> 07:56.209
Now, the power outages

07:56.243 --> 07:58.111
are following the
natural citywide

07:58.145 --> 07:59.112
gust flow.

07:59.146 --> 08:00.714
I got a D-minus

08:00.748 --> 08:01.882
in environmental
science, by the way.

08:01.915 --> 08:04.718
It was a real squeaker, but,
you know, passing is passing.

08:04.752 --> 08:06.520
Brian, Brian, your parents
must have been very proud.

08:06.554 --> 08:08.722
They really were.
All right, watch this.

08:08.756 --> 08:10.791
Drafts get stuck

08:10.824 --> 08:12.092
inside the city walls,

08:12.125 --> 08:14.928
and then slingshot up
and over the high-rises.

08:14.962 --> 08:17.030
And you can see, it goes

08:17.064 --> 08:19.933
right from the Financial
District up to Midtown.

08:19.967 --> 08:22.202
So you're saying the blackout
is weather related?

08:22.235 --> 08:24.605
Oh, I'm saying that
based on the pattern,

08:24.638 --> 08:25.839
whatever's causing the blackouts

08:25.873 --> 08:28.709
might be getting blown around
by the wind, but, you know,

08:28.742 --> 08:30.644
I'd have to confirm by visiting

08:30.678 --> 08:32.245
local power plants,
and, uh...

08:32.279 --> 08:34.748
And we should still rule out
the possibility

08:34.782 --> 08:36.083
of cyber warfare,

08:36.116 --> 08:37.585
of course.

08:38.719 --> 08:40.153
NAZ:
All right.

08:40.187 --> 08:41.855
Go.

08:41.889 --> 08:42.856
Okay.

08:42.890 --> 08:44.124
NAZ: Agent Paget will
coordinate with Cyber.

08:44.157 --> 08:46.560
Agent Boyle will deal with the
task force here on the floor.

08:46.594 --> 08:48.562
I'll give you a lift.

08:48.596 --> 08:49.697
You're coming?

08:49.730 --> 08:50.831
Is that a problem?

08:50.864 --> 08:52.566
Uh, no, I just...
I don't know.

08:52.600 --> 08:53.834
It's kind of
a wild guess.

08:53.867 --> 08:55.636
I don't want to
waste your time.

08:55.669 --> 08:57.170
Well, I've seen those
pan out before.

08:57.204 --> 08:59.272
You can explain it
on the way.

08:59.306 --> 09:00.741
Oh.

09:00.774 --> 09:01.942
We should let Mike and Ike know.

09:01.975 --> 09:05.679
Oh, I actually kind of sent them
on a mission of their own.

09:12.085 --> 09:13.987
Man, what in the
hell are you doing?

09:14.021 --> 09:15.155
Nothing.

09:15.188 --> 09:16.757
You're primping.

09:16.790 --> 09:18.859
I'm not primping.

09:18.892 --> 09:19.960
Like a peacock.

09:19.993 --> 09:21.194
Got to look good

09:21.228 --> 09:22.863
to win over
little sister Finch.

09:22.896 --> 09:24.998
Oh, please.
That ship already came in.

09:25.032 --> 09:26.700
Well, do tell.

09:26.734 --> 09:29.703
Yeah, we've been,
um... texting.

09:29.737 --> 09:30.971
Mm-hmm.

09:31.004 --> 09:35.008
Which is mainly...
you know, me texting.

09:35.042 --> 09:37.244
She's not
texting you back.

09:37.277 --> 09:38.679
How many texts

09:38.712 --> 09:40.247
have you sent?

09:42.115 --> 09:44.384
I mean, do Bitmojis count?

09:44.417 --> 09:46.086
(door opens)

09:47.054 --> 09:48.088
Oh, hi.

09:48.121 --> 09:49.723
Hi.
Hi, Rachel. Hi.

09:49.757 --> 09:52.592
Thanks for picking me up.
Yeah.

09:53.360 --> 09:54.662
(sighs)

09:56.830 --> 09:59.767
Are we going or just...?

09:59.800 --> 10:00.768
Buckle up.
Yeah.

10:00.801 --> 10:02.803
(engine starts)

10:02.836 --> 10:04.337
Generator's operational.

10:04.371 --> 10:07.975
I've had my guys
check and recheck.

10:08.008 --> 10:09.977
Nothing wrong
with the turbine blades.

10:10.010 --> 10:11.244
The rotor is moving.

10:11.278 --> 10:13.280
The stator is good.

10:14.948 --> 10:16.684
It doesn't make any sense.

10:16.717 --> 10:18.418
We should be hot.

10:18.451 --> 10:19.787
MAN (over P.A.):
Engineer, please stand by.

10:19.820 --> 10:21.254
Actual pressure test.

10:21.288 --> 10:22.823
You guys hear that?

10:27.160 --> 10:29.362
(electrical humming)

10:29.396 --> 10:30.497
Hey, Maurice.

10:30.530 --> 10:34.367
So the electricity's not
making it out of the generator.

10:34.401 --> 10:36.369
It's-it's not reaching
the power lines.

10:36.403 --> 10:39.406
Exactly. It's just
disappearing into thin air.

10:40.808 --> 10:42.009
Can you open it up?

10:42.042 --> 10:43.243
Sure. Step back.

10:43.276 --> 10:44.712
What are you looking for?

10:44.745 --> 10:46.113
Well...

10:52.419 --> 10:54.387
Well, if it was
carried by the wind,

10:54.421 --> 10:56.456
it might be something
we can't see

10:56.489 --> 10:57.991
with the naked eye.

10:58.025 --> 10:59.827
Do you mind if I borrow
that black light?

10:59.860 --> 11:01.394
MAURICE:
Be my guest.

11:05.165 --> 11:06.734
Here, step back.

11:28.255 --> 11:30.390
MAURICE:
What the hell is it?

11:30.423 --> 11:33.761
Whatever it is,
it's organic.

11:33.794 --> 11:36.096
Could that be causing
the blackout though? Thank you.

11:36.129 --> 11:38.766
Can I talk to you for a minute?

11:39.800 --> 11:41.168
We have to call Naz.

11:41.201 --> 11:43.737
This could be some kind
of biological attack.

11:43.771 --> 11:45.973
Yeah.

11:46.006 --> 11:48.441
You know, I saw
this last night.

11:48.475 --> 11:50.177
Out on your Capeless Crusade?

11:50.210 --> 11:52.179
This glowy stuff, it
was on a murder victim.

11:52.212 --> 11:54.014
It was all over
his hands.

11:54.047 --> 11:56.049
I mean, it's got to be
connected somehow.

11:56.083 --> 11:59.486
Oh, so your illicit,
illegal escapades,

11:59.519 --> 12:01.488
they weren't for nothing.

12:01.521 --> 12:03.891
I also do some good, you know.
And the city thanks you,

12:03.924 --> 12:07.060
but... it doesn't make
what you did right, or legal,

12:07.094 --> 12:07.995
or okay with me.

12:08.028 --> 12:10.130
You want to follow up
on this lead or not?

12:10.163 --> 12:11.264
Yes, lead on.

12:12.532 --> 12:15.035
BRIAN: So we headed to
the workplace of Luis Vargas,

12:15.068 --> 12:17.104
the dead security guard
with the glowing hands.

12:17.137 --> 12:19.006
The New York City
Department of Buildings

12:19.039 --> 12:21.041
is the department that
regulates the building of,

12:21.074 --> 12:23.010
well, buildings.

12:23.043 --> 12:24.912
Which is where we ran into
my new friend,

12:24.945 --> 12:26.546
Detective Hernandez.

12:26.579 --> 12:28.015
Brian Finch.

12:28.048 --> 12:30.150
The man fights crime
by day, too.

12:30.183 --> 12:32.085
Detective Hernandez,
meet Agent Rebecca Harris.

12:32.119 --> 12:34.454
Thanks for letting us borrow
your golden boy last night.

12:34.487 --> 12:35.956
Pleasure.

12:35.989 --> 12:37.190
So what's up?
Well, last night,

12:37.224 --> 12:38.792
I noticed something
really weird.

12:38.826 --> 12:40.260
It was like a green
and orange substance

12:40.293 --> 12:41.528
on Luis Vargas's body.

12:41.561 --> 12:43.797
I think it may be
connected to the blackout.

12:43.831 --> 12:44.998
Did you guys notice
anything unusual here?

12:45.032 --> 12:46.266
I mean, there was a broken lamp

12:46.299 --> 12:48.235
on the 18th floor,
but far as we could tell,

12:48.268 --> 12:50.003
it could've been knocked over
in the blackout.

12:50.037 --> 12:51.872
Nothing's missing.
Huh.

12:51.905 --> 12:53.841
Isn't that where they store the
blueprints for city buildings?

12:53.874 --> 12:55.142
Saw it on the directory.

12:55.175 --> 12:56.476
You mind if we
take a look?

12:56.509 --> 12:58.311
Cool.

12:58.345 --> 12:59.512
Elevators are out, aren't they?

12:59.546 --> 13:00.881
Yup.

13:00.914 --> 13:02.549
Hope you packed extra lungs.
(chuckles)

13:10.257 --> 13:12.159
(groans)

13:12.192 --> 13:14.294
I've got to up my cardio.

13:14.327 --> 13:15.562
What do you think,
spinning?

13:15.595 --> 13:17.230
Do you spin?

13:17.264 --> 13:18.866
I chase you around all night.

13:24.972 --> 13:27.407
Hey, you know,
to be fair,

13:27.440 --> 13:29.042
we wouldn't even be
following this lead--

13:29.076 --> 13:32.312
hang on-- if I hadn't gone
out last night on NZT.

13:32.345 --> 13:35.082
If you expect me
to thank you for a lead

13:35.115 --> 13:37.484
that took me up
18 flights of stairs...

13:38.952 --> 13:42.222
It's just, you swore you would
stop hoarding NZT pills.

13:42.255 --> 13:43.857
I have.

13:43.891 --> 13:45.292
Okay, that was my last one.

13:45.325 --> 13:47.427
Well, and this one.

13:47.460 --> 13:48.996
The one Mike gave me.

13:50.130 --> 13:52.099
You promise
you're not lying to me?

13:52.132 --> 13:53.901
What are we, six years old?

13:53.934 --> 13:56.203
I promise, okay?

13:56.236 --> 13:58.038
No more extra pills.

14:13.186 --> 14:15.288
Well, files here.

14:15.322 --> 14:17.090
Files there.

14:17.124 --> 14:19.159
You want to split up,
cover more ground?

14:19.192 --> 14:21.061
Yeah.

14:23.931 --> 14:26.266
You might be wondering
what I'm looking for.

14:26.299 --> 14:27.634
So am I.

14:27.667 --> 14:29.636
But I at least have a theory:

14:29.669 --> 14:31.604
someone broke in here
searching for something.

14:31.638 --> 14:34.474
But what were they after?

14:42.615 --> 14:45.052
I mean, their filing system
was a clerical nightmare,

14:45.085 --> 14:47.921
but after I sorted out the
documents that were misfiled,

14:47.955 --> 14:49.489
or misplaced...

14:53.026 --> 14:55.929
...there was one empty drawer
that stood out,

14:55.963 --> 14:58.298
one that seemed
recently raided.

15:00.600 --> 15:03.670
Blueprints for a building
on 53rd Street in Turtle Bay.

15:03.703 --> 15:07.407
What was there that was worth
murdering a guard for?

15:07.440 --> 15:10.343
And how did all this relate
to the blackout?

15:12.612 --> 15:14.214
(door closes)

15:14.247 --> 15:15.983
Rebecca?

15:21.054 --> 15:23.256
Rebecca?!

15:24.424 --> 15:26.426
(sirens chirping)

15:27.760 --> 15:29.329
BRIAN:
Whoa.

15:29.362 --> 15:31.364
Detective Hernandez,
what's going on?

15:31.398 --> 15:32.632
Sir, please hold right there.

15:32.665 --> 15:34.601
Are you Brian Finch?
Yeah.

15:35.635 --> 15:37.737
He's positive.

15:37.770 --> 15:39.506
You need to come with us.
What the hell?

15:39.539 --> 15:40.640
Under 42 CFR 70,

15:40.673 --> 15:42.409
we're placing you
into quarantine.

15:42.442 --> 15:45.412
You came into contact
with a suspicious substance.

15:45.445 --> 15:46.813
What, the stuff from the
power plant? What was it?
Undetermined.

15:46.846 --> 15:49.449
Well, what does that mean?
It means it came from
an unknown origin.

15:49.482 --> 15:52.152
You've both been exposed.
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

16:03.330 --> 16:05.065
(lock clicks)

16:05.098 --> 16:07.167
Remember when you offered
to give me a ride today?

16:07.200 --> 16:09.702
And I was like, "Nah,"
and you were like, "I insist."

16:09.736 --> 16:12.472
I'm guessing you regret
that decision now.

16:12.505 --> 16:13.740
You're not wrong.

16:13.773 --> 16:16.376
Of all days to get sealed up

16:16.409 --> 16:19.112
in a plastic bubble together.

16:20.547 --> 16:22.082
I just mean
'cause you're annoyed

16:22.115 --> 16:23.650
about last night
and the pills.

16:23.683 --> 16:25.485
We cleared that up.

16:25.518 --> 16:27.354
Unless you're
still lying to me.
I'm not.

16:27.387 --> 16:29.222
Then we're good.
Good.

16:29.256 --> 16:31.224
(sighs)

16:31.258 --> 16:32.759
My phone's dead.

16:32.792 --> 16:34.594
Here, can I borrow yours?

16:34.627 --> 16:36.396
Just got to do some research
on the Luis Vargas case.

16:40.367 --> 16:42.769
(muffled):
Well, here's a lucky pair.

16:42.802 --> 16:45.772
I'm Sturgeon Reid,
astrophysicist.

16:45.805 --> 16:47.440
Today, I'm working
in tandem with the CDC

16:47.474 --> 16:48.375
to take a look
at the substance

16:48.408 --> 16:50.810
that you encountered
at the power plant.

16:50.843 --> 16:53.246
Why is an astrophysicist
working with the CDC?

16:53.280 --> 16:54.581
(chuckles):
Well...

16:54.614 --> 16:56.316
MAN (on TV):
What did we discover today?

16:56.349 --> 16:59.552
Officials are not yet sure,

16:59.586 --> 17:02.389
but panspermia, yeah?

17:02.422 --> 17:04.291
The idea that life
on Earth was seeded

17:04.324 --> 17:06.126
from other planets,
other places...
What exactly were we exposed to?

17:06.159 --> 17:07.794
Would you turn that off, please?

17:07.827 --> 17:10.363
...extraterrestrial life...

17:10.397 --> 17:12.832
We know that it is a bacterium,

17:12.865 --> 17:15.502
which appears to be feeding
directly off the electricity

17:15.535 --> 17:17.270
generated by the power plant.

17:17.304 --> 17:20.307
It's not the first bacterium
to do this,

17:20.340 --> 17:21.508
but this species is unique.

17:21.541 --> 17:22.575
Unique?

17:22.609 --> 17:24.544
As in... from outer space?

17:24.577 --> 17:26.313
We found traces
of the bacterium

17:26.346 --> 17:28.448
on a cargo ship that passed

17:28.481 --> 17:30.483
under the Quadrantids
meteor shower yesterday.

17:30.517 --> 17:32.752
So it's possible

17:32.785 --> 17:34.554
that the origins
of this species could be...

17:34.587 --> 17:35.588
Alien?

17:36.856 --> 17:39.092
This is awesome.

17:39.126 --> 17:40.393
Wait, we're not gonna die,
are we?

17:40.427 --> 17:41.728
What's the plan

17:41.761 --> 17:43.663
to stop the bacteria
from spreading?

17:43.696 --> 17:44.664
Since it's feeding
off electricity,

17:44.697 --> 17:46.166
we're hoping to starve it

17:46.199 --> 17:47.867
by shutting down
all the power in Manhattan.

17:47.900 --> 17:50.203
That's going to be chaos.

17:50.237 --> 17:51.804
And how long
do we have to stay here?

17:51.838 --> 17:53.540
REID:
Well, since you've had

17:53.573 --> 17:55.408
direct exposure,
I've recommended

17:55.442 --> 17:57.410
you stay in observation.

17:57.444 --> 17:59.412
Alert the attendant
if you feel ill.

17:59.446 --> 18:01.281
But look on the bright side.

18:01.314 --> 18:03.082
You could be making history.

18:05.585 --> 18:07.220
I don't know about all this.

18:07.254 --> 18:08.555
What do you mean?

18:08.588 --> 18:10.523
I don't know.

18:10.557 --> 18:11.724
Can I borrow your phone?

18:11.758 --> 18:13.226
Or we could play charades.

18:15.328 --> 18:16.563
Thank you.

18:18.331 --> 18:19.632
(horns honking)

18:19.666 --> 18:20.667
(engine revs, tires screech)

18:20.700 --> 18:22.302
(music playing)
What's your, uh,

18:22.335 --> 18:24.437
what's your station?

18:24.471 --> 18:25.705
Anything's good.

18:25.738 --> 18:27.840
I don't really listen
to the radio.

18:27.874 --> 18:30.243
(turns off radio)

18:30.277 --> 18:32.279
(horns honking)

18:36.616 --> 18:38.585
Looks like we're getting out
of here just in time, huh?

18:38.618 --> 18:40.420
I don't want to.
Come on, come on.

18:40.453 --> 18:41.854
Hey, thanks for this,
by the way.

18:41.888 --> 18:44.324
You can imagine what it's like

18:44.357 --> 18:45.458
to have a cold,
stir-crazy five-year-old.

18:45.492 --> 18:46.693
GIRL:
No, I want my...

18:46.726 --> 18:48.361
Give me the bag.
All right, we need the bag.

18:48.395 --> 18:50.497
(horns honking)
You have the bag?

18:52.899 --> 18:55.335
(Marie laughs)
Come on.

18:55.368 --> 18:56.369
Hi.

18:56.403 --> 18:58.505
Oh, I'm so glad you're...
I'm so glad you're okay.

18:58.538 --> 19:00.273
Hi, doll.

19:00.307 --> 19:01.441
Hi, honey.

19:01.474 --> 19:03.476
Oh, we're so glad you got here.
We were getting worried.

19:03.510 --> 19:05.445
Who's that?

19:05.478 --> 19:06.713
They got us out of the city.

19:06.746 --> 19:08.515
Be nice.

19:11.251 --> 19:12.885
Thanks for taking care
of my kids.

19:12.919 --> 19:13.920
Of course, sir.

19:13.953 --> 19:16.155
It was... it was our pleasure.

19:17.390 --> 19:19.226
Well, I assume you'll
be going back now.

19:19.259 --> 19:20.893
Good luck.

19:20.927 --> 19:22.595
Actually, our orders are to stay

19:22.629 --> 19:23.796
until everything's
been cleared up.

19:23.830 --> 19:25.298
Orders from whom?

19:25.332 --> 19:26.299
Your son, sir.

19:26.333 --> 19:28.268
Brian.

19:28.301 --> 19:30.437
IKE:
We can wait outside,
if that's easier.

19:30.470 --> 19:32.439
Well, no, of course not.

19:32.472 --> 19:33.573
It's freezing. Uh, come in.

19:33.606 --> 19:35.342
Dennis is just
getting lunch.

19:35.375 --> 19:37.810
I'm gluten-free.

19:37.844 --> 19:38.778
BRIAN (on phone):
Turtle Bay.

19:38.811 --> 19:41.314
The address is on 53rd
between 2nd and 3rd.

19:41.348 --> 19:43.516
BOYLE:
You do realize
we're kind of busy here.

19:43.550 --> 19:45.785
BRIAN:
Yeah, I'm not asking you to go
get me some Skittles, Boyle.

19:45.818 --> 19:48.255
I know this is important.

19:48.288 --> 19:49.656
Look, the missing blueprints

19:49.689 --> 19:51.524
were for some kind of
commercial building,

19:51.558 --> 19:53.926
and when I looked online,
all of the occupants

19:53.960 --> 19:55.928
from the ground up
were pretty mundane.

19:55.962 --> 19:58.665
I mean, I couldn't figure out
why anyone would target them.

19:58.698 --> 20:00.667
But the basement tenant

20:00.700 --> 20:03.803
is the United States Bureau
of Engraving and Printing.

20:03.836 --> 20:05.305
Oh, I know that location.

20:05.338 --> 20:07.006
It's where banks send
soiled and defaced bills.

20:07.039 --> 20:08.341
Exactly.

20:08.375 --> 20:10.277
The Department
of Mutilated Money.

20:10.310 --> 20:12.412
And the New York office
handles the entire northeast.

20:12.445 --> 20:13.680
I mean, do you know
how much cash

20:13.713 --> 20:15.315
they must have in there?

20:15.348 --> 20:16.316
Yeah, but it's
unusable currency,

20:16.349 --> 20:17.284
waiting to be destroyed.

20:17.317 --> 20:19.352
Not all of it.
A good fraction of it can be

20:19.386 --> 20:21.688
cleaned and repaired.
A security guard,
Luis Vargas,

20:21.721 --> 20:23.690
was killed the other day,
presumably by whoever

20:23.723 --> 20:25.492
was stealing the blueprints
for this address.

20:25.525 --> 20:26.993
And do you know
what they found on his body?

20:27.026 --> 20:29.562
The same bacterium
that's causing the blackout,

20:29.596 --> 20:31.964
except Luis Vargas was killed

20:31.998 --> 20:34.834
a full day before
the meteor shower hit New York.

20:34.867 --> 20:37.837
So you think the bacteria came
from some other alien invasion?

20:37.870 --> 20:39.606
As much as I hate to admit it,

20:39.639 --> 20:41.574
I think it might not
be alien at all.

20:41.608 --> 20:43.776
I mean, they say it's similar
to known bacteria.

20:43.810 --> 20:48.715
So what if someone
cultivated a new strain

20:48.748 --> 20:50.983
and released it
to cause a blackout?

20:51.017 --> 20:52.985
It's the perfect cover
to steal a bunch of cash.

20:53.019 --> 20:54.554
Yeah, mutilated cash.

20:54.587 --> 20:55.688
Why not hit a bank?

20:55.722 --> 20:57.490
Because it's an easier target.

20:57.524 --> 20:58.791
I mean, people
think that money's

20:58.825 --> 21:00.627
basically trash, which means
people wouldn't think

21:00.660 --> 21:02.562
to look there first,
but we did.

21:02.595 --> 21:04.030
And if we can just
get over there,

21:04.063 --> 21:05.865
we might be able to stop
the heist from happening

21:05.898 --> 21:07.467
and find the people responsible

21:07.500 --> 21:08.968
for the whole blackout.
Yeah.

21:09.001 --> 21:12.505
And by we, I mean you,

21:12.539 --> 21:14.574
because we're still
kind of quarantined here.

21:14.607 --> 21:16.075
All right,
I'll see what I can do.

21:16.108 --> 21:17.777
(phone beeps)

21:19.746 --> 21:21.814
Can I have that?

21:21.848 --> 21:23.750
What the hell is this?

21:23.783 --> 21:25.518
Can I have my phone, please?
No.

21:25.552 --> 21:26.619
What the hell is this?

21:26.653 --> 21:27.787
Who-who sent this to you?

21:30.056 --> 21:31.924
An agent sent to search

21:31.958 --> 21:33.893
the government property
where you're living

21:33.926 --> 21:34.927
for what looks like
NZT pills

21:34.961 --> 21:36.463
hidden in your
vinyl collection.

21:36.496 --> 21:37.664
You told me
there weren't any more.

21:37.697 --> 21:38.898
You know, you could've
said something to me

21:38.931 --> 21:41.534
before sending the cavalry
into my apartment.

21:41.568 --> 21:43.503
I did say something,
and you lied to me.

21:43.536 --> 21:45.538
Do you have any idea

21:45.572 --> 21:46.639
how irresponsible it is

21:46.673 --> 21:49.642
to use this drug however
you want, whenever you want?

21:49.676 --> 21:52.379
The rules,
managing your dosage,

21:52.412 --> 21:53.813
keeping a watch out for you--

21:53.846 --> 21:56.048
they're there to keep you alive,
to keep you safe.

21:56.082 --> 21:58.518
Oh, come on! The FBI doesn't
care about keeping me safe.

21:58.551 --> 21:59.752
They care about
keeping me useful.

21:59.786 --> 22:00.920
Brian, if you think
that I don't care,

22:00.953 --> 22:02.489
then you haven't been
paying attention.

22:02.522 --> 22:04.924
I brought you into the FBI,
I've stood up for you
Don't, don't, don't, don't.

22:04.957 --> 22:06.626
more times than I can count.
You have no idea
what you're talking about here.

22:06.659 --> 22:07.927
I know what happens

22:07.960 --> 22:09.729
if this gets out of hand.
I'm not
like anyone.

22:09.762 --> 22:12.532
No one else
is going through what I am

22:12.565 --> 22:15.402
going through.
You are hiding pills
like an addict, Brian.

22:15.435 --> 22:18.538
I know that you are immune
to NZT side effects,

22:18.571 --> 22:20.540
and I know that makes you think
that you're different somehow,

22:20.573 --> 22:23.075
but you are not immune.
Oh, you're gonna tell me
what I think right now?

22:23.109 --> 22:25.412
I'm not... That's not
what I'm saying.
No, 'cause you don't know

22:25.445 --> 22:26.946
inside my head, Rebecca.
We're not psychic twins, okay?

22:26.979 --> 22:28.815
And if you want
the real truth,

22:28.848 --> 22:30.483
I may be addicted
to these drugs.

22:30.517 --> 22:31.751
Thanks for that, by the way.

22:31.784 --> 22:33.753
But you're addicted to me.

22:33.786 --> 22:35.488
What?
Solving things,
breaking cases,

22:35.522 --> 22:36.689
that's your high.

22:36.723 --> 22:38.825
And because of me, you get
to do it at a whole new level.

22:38.858 --> 22:40.427
What, you want to go back
to your old life?

22:40.460 --> 22:41.694
Keeping up
with paperwork

22:41.728 --> 22:43.095
and crossing your T's
and dotting your I's,

22:43.129 --> 22:44.464
seeing it all end
in frustration,

22:44.497 --> 22:45.632
what, like,
half the time?

22:45.665 --> 22:47.700
You need all this
as much as I do.

22:47.734 --> 22:50.002
You need NZT as much as I do,
and you know it.

22:52.772 --> 22:55.374
Can I have my phone?

23:00.112 --> 23:02.114
BRIAN:
Two pills.

23:02.148 --> 23:03.716
They only found two.

23:03.750 --> 23:04.751
Where are the others?

23:09.822 --> 23:11.524
Dad looks stressed.
MARIE:
Well, can you blame him?

23:11.558 --> 23:12.925
First there's
the power outage.

23:12.959 --> 23:14.694
Now we have federal agents
in the living room,

23:14.727 --> 23:16.496
making awkward
conversation.

23:16.529 --> 23:18.064
(video game playing)

23:18.097 --> 23:19.666
Yeah.

23:19.699 --> 23:21.834
Or maybe he's just
picking up on the glances

23:21.868 --> 23:23.936
between you and the one
who looks like Cary Grant.

23:23.970 --> 23:25.505
Mom.
Well,

23:25.538 --> 23:27.039
I'm just saying,
Rachel, come on.

23:27.073 --> 23:29.509
That boy is smitten,
it's written all over his face.

23:29.542 --> 23:31.511
Please stop talking.

23:31.544 --> 23:33.980
Square jaw,
still has all his hair.

23:34.013 --> 23:35.915
I swear to God, I will cut my
wrist with this butter knife.

23:35.948 --> 23:37.183
All right, so something
is on your mind.

23:37.216 --> 23:39.886
If it's not him, what is it?

23:41.187 --> 23:42.955
Don't tell Dad, okay?

23:42.989 --> 23:44.991
He gets so upset
about these things.

23:46.693 --> 23:48.695
(video game playing)

23:50.497 --> 23:51.564
It's Brian.

23:51.598 --> 23:55.668
We were hanging out at his
safe house the other night,

23:55.702 --> 23:58.838
and he went over to his records,

23:58.871 --> 24:01.808
and it looked like
he took something out.

24:01.841 --> 24:03.743
So when he left, I went over...

24:03.776 --> 24:06.779
(sighs)

24:06.813 --> 24:08.815
...and I found...

24:14.521 --> 24:16.756
I'm not sure
what they are,

24:16.789 --> 24:18.958
but I'm pretty sure that
they are part of why he is

24:18.991 --> 24:21.127
the way that
he is now.

24:21.160 --> 24:24.130
But what's really
bothering me is...

24:24.163 --> 24:28.134
did he get into the FBI
because he's taking these?

24:28.167 --> 24:31.170
Or are they the ones
that are giving it to him?

24:31.203 --> 24:32.204
I've never seen
anything like this.

24:32.872 --> 24:33.840
You okay?

24:33.873 --> 24:34.841
Hey, Dad.

24:34.874 --> 24:36.976
Yes, yes.
good, um...

24:37.009 --> 24:39.145
Here, let me help you
put out lunch, okay?

24:39.178 --> 24:40.913
Okay, good.

24:48.888 --> 24:50.890
(metallic creaking)

25:02.068 --> 25:03.302
(whistles)

25:03.335 --> 25:04.904
They cleaned house.

25:04.937 --> 25:07.173
BRIAN:
Not a dollar inside?

25:07.206 --> 25:08.641
BOYLE:
Not one you can spend.

25:08.675 --> 25:09.909
Cleaned out.

25:09.942 --> 25:11.177
Looks like you had
the right idea.

25:11.210 --> 25:12.912
We just didn't get here in time.

25:12.945 --> 25:15.915
So it was a heist, and they did
know the blackout was coming.

25:15.948 --> 25:18.217
Well, I talked to the
department's senior manager.

25:18.250 --> 25:19.351
The guy estimates

25:19.385 --> 25:22.822
there was a little more
than $8 million in this safe.

25:25.825 --> 25:27.326
Boyle, I have to
call you back.

25:27.359 --> 25:29.195
Looks like the CDC
might have an update.
BOYLE: All right.

25:31.363 --> 25:34.066
Agent Rebecca Harris,
Brian Finch.

25:34.100 --> 25:36.035
Aren't you guys supposed to be
wearing masks or something?

25:36.068 --> 25:39.105
The bacterium proved
non-communicable.

25:39.138 --> 25:41.107
Seems it feeds
exclusively on electrons

25:41.140 --> 25:43.309
found in inanimate
sources.

25:43.342 --> 25:45.011
Meaning we didn't have to be
here in the first place?

25:45.044 --> 25:47.046
You're free to go.

25:47.079 --> 25:49.782
Well, after we
take your vitals.

25:49.816 --> 25:51.651
Legal issue. Proof we sent
you home in good health.

25:51.684 --> 25:53.219
(chirping)

25:53.252 --> 25:55.154
You're discharged.
Hey, Rebecca?

25:58.357 --> 26:00.960
(chirping)
(sighs)

26:00.993 --> 26:02.695
We get our clothes back, right?

26:02.729 --> 26:05.264
DENNIS:
Marie.

26:05.297 --> 26:06.999
Marie, stop.

26:07.033 --> 26:08.735
Come here.

26:08.768 --> 26:10.637
Sit down, talk to me.

26:10.670 --> 26:12.905
What's on your mind?

26:12.939 --> 26:13.973
(sighs)

26:14.006 --> 26:16.075
You talk to Brian
more than I do.

26:16.108 --> 26:20.647
He's always sought you out,
trusted you.

26:20.680 --> 26:22.181
Dennis, I know that you

26:22.214 --> 26:23.916
have been talking to him
about all this, all right?

26:23.950 --> 26:27.954
And I understand if you want
to keep it close to the vest,

26:27.987 --> 26:29.856
and you wouldn't do that
if you didn't know

26:29.889 --> 26:31.157
that he was all right.

26:31.190 --> 26:33.626
ButBrian all right?

26:33.660 --> 26:35.161
What do you mean?

26:35.194 --> 26:37.630
I mean, what are
they doing to him?

26:37.664 --> 26:39.231
Do you know?

26:39.265 --> 26:40.700
He's fine.

26:40.733 --> 26:42.969
Brian's gonna
be all right.

26:43.002 --> 26:46.739
Do you know anything about pills
or drugs they're giving him?

26:49.375 --> 26:50.810
What do you know?

26:50.843 --> 26:52.845
*

26:56.448 --> 26:58.284
Hard at work, I see.

26:58.317 --> 27:00.219
Yeah.

27:02.755 --> 27:04.256
You okay?

27:04.290 --> 27:06.025
Yeah.

27:08.027 --> 27:09.261
I mean, I'm a little bummed

27:09.295 --> 27:11.263
that the CDC burned
my Joy Division shirt.

27:11.297 --> 27:12.999
It was an original.

27:13.032 --> 27:14.901
(scoffs)

27:14.934 --> 27:16.168
You seen Rebecca?

27:16.202 --> 27:17.770
She's upstairs with Naz.

27:17.804 --> 27:18.771
Mm.

27:18.805 --> 27:21.908
Something happen between
you two, in quarantine?

27:21.941 --> 27:24.443
I don't know, mistakes were
made, words were said.

27:24.476 --> 27:26.178
I guess it's our first
real fight.

27:26.212 --> 27:28.180
Oh.

27:28.214 --> 27:30.182
The handler-consultant
relationship is stressful enough

27:30.216 --> 27:32.451
without being thrown into
a plastic bubble together.

27:32.484 --> 27:34.453
You guys will
get through it.

27:34.486 --> 27:37.156
Okay?
Yeah.

27:37.189 --> 27:40.092
Generators and cell towers
are starting to power down.

27:40.126 --> 27:41.360
I told Naz I'd come down,

27:41.393 --> 27:43.095
check in to see
if you had any leads

27:43.129 --> 27:44.363
on the mutilated
money gang.

27:44.396 --> 27:46.098
Yeah, I do have something.

27:46.132 --> 27:48.701
So my theory is that
whoever pulled off the heist

27:48.735 --> 27:50.970
planted the bacteria, right?

27:51.003 --> 27:53.239
And since the financial district
was the first to lose power,

27:53.272 --> 27:55.341
specifically the 200 block
of Chambers Street,

27:55.374 --> 27:58.878
we can assume that's where the
bacteria was first introduced.

27:58.911 --> 28:01.413
Now, as for who did it,

28:01.447 --> 28:04.150
there are only 12 people
in the New York area

28:04.183 --> 28:05.852
with enough scientific expertise

28:05.885 --> 28:07.820
to not only engineer
the bacteria,

28:07.854 --> 28:10.089
but also know how
to successfully plant it.

28:10.122 --> 28:13.092
Now, if they were smart enough
to do all that,

28:13.125 --> 28:14.827
then they're probably
smart enough

28:14.861 --> 28:16.228
to stay off security cameras.

28:16.262 --> 28:18.097
And that's where these come in.

28:18.130 --> 28:21.834
Well, I've come to respect
some of your ways, Finch,

28:21.868 --> 28:24.036
that doesn't mean
that I'm gonna

28:24.070 --> 28:25.304
be strolling around
the financial district

28:25.337 --> 28:26.405
wearing
a sandwich board.

28:26.438 --> 28:28.775
There's a large homeless
population around that area,

28:28.808 --> 28:31.043
people who have nowhere
to go during a blackout.

28:31.077 --> 28:32.779
They might be able to identify
one of the perps.

28:32.812 --> 28:34.781
Or I could just call
a friend at the NSA.

28:34.814 --> 28:36.315
We're not doing that.

28:36.348 --> 28:37.316
Why not?

28:37.349 --> 28:39.151
Yeah, they would
have a copy

28:39.185 --> 28:41.053
of every phone conversation
these scientists have had.

28:41.087 --> 28:44.023
Well, is this on the DL or are
we asserting the Patriot Act?

28:45.324 --> 28:47.293
You're siding to protect
people's privacy?

28:47.326 --> 28:48.427
That's ironic.

28:48.460 --> 28:52.098
Heist or not, someone shut down
the power on Manhattan.

28:52.131 --> 28:53.833
That's an act
of terrorism.

28:53.866 --> 28:55.835
Or you can wear
the sandwich board.

28:55.868 --> 28:57.403
He's your consultant.
Actually,

28:57.436 --> 28:58.204
I was gonna make a few.

28:58.237 --> 28:59.538
I thought we could
all wear them.

28:59.571 --> 29:01.007
No, you're right, Boyle.

29:01.040 --> 29:03.275
We should call in the NSA.

29:03.309 --> 29:05.277
Brian, can I talk
to you for a second?

29:05.311 --> 29:07.046
Yeah.

29:10.149 --> 29:12.384
Look, I'm sorry...

29:12.418 --> 29:14.120
You know, when all
of this started,

29:14.153 --> 29:16.388
we made promises to each other.

29:16.422 --> 29:17.890
I said I would help you
through anything

29:17.924 --> 29:19.125
as long as you didn't lie to me.

29:19.158 --> 29:22.061
I know. I didn't mean
to lie to you.
I just spoke to Naz.

29:22.094 --> 29:24.330
You're being assigned
to a different handler,

29:24.363 --> 29:26.098
and in the meantime,
you'll work with Boyle.

29:32.604 --> 29:34.573
*

29:34.606 --> 29:37.076
BRIAN:
Of course the day the NSA
came to the CJC

29:37.109 --> 29:41.447
was the day everything started
spiraling out of control.

29:41.480 --> 29:44.016
You know how for years
the NSA's been saying

29:44.050 --> 29:46.385
they only collect metadata
from phone conversations?

29:46.418 --> 29:48.254
Well, that's sort of a lie.

29:48.287 --> 29:49.455
Don't handle that, please.

29:49.488 --> 29:51.924
They're actually
recording and storing

29:51.958 --> 29:53.826
the audio of at least
80% of Americans' phone calls.

29:53.860 --> 29:54.526
Sign here.

30:02.034 --> 30:03.035
Can I touch?

30:09.175 --> 30:11.878
The average adult
sends and receives

30:11.911 --> 30:13.145
about five calls a day.

30:13.179 --> 30:16.415
Times that by 365 days,
times 12 suspects,

30:16.448 --> 30:19.418
I'm listening to over
21,000 conversations.

30:19.451 --> 30:21.420
Most of them were
totally irrelevant.

30:21.453 --> 30:23.990
I told you not to push her away.

30:25.357 --> 30:27.426
Relax, you don't have
to say anything.

30:28.961 --> 30:30.496
A new handler? Really?

30:30.529 --> 30:33.499
You think you're gonna
be able to make that work?

30:33.532 --> 30:37.503
Is there anyone else here who
will protect you like she did?

30:37.536 --> 30:40.006
How are you going to fix this?

30:40.039 --> 30:41.640
I can't.

30:41.673 --> 30:45.077
(indistinct conversations
over headset)

30:45.111 --> 30:46.612
Ma... uh...

30:46.645 --> 30:48.647
I can't... I can't make out
this last track. If you...

30:48.680 --> 30:49.648
Yeah, rewind that.

30:49.681 --> 30:50.883
Thank you.

30:52.151 --> 30:54.020
Where was I? Right.

30:54.053 --> 30:57.056
It's down to Ian Marshall
and Sturgeon Reid.

31:09.068 --> 31:11.403
One dollar says we will find
evidence of alien life

31:11.437 --> 31:12.538
in our lifetime.

31:12.571 --> 31:14.306
REID:
And one dollar says we won't.

31:18.344 --> 31:21.313
I believe you owe Dr. Marshall
a dollar, Dr. Reid.

31:21.347 --> 31:23.182
What is this?

31:23.215 --> 31:25.051
What are we
doing here?

31:25.084 --> 31:27.319
You two have kind of
a friendly rivalry.

31:27.353 --> 31:29.055
Ish.

31:29.088 --> 31:31.323
Just a couple of eminent
astrophysicists

31:31.357 --> 31:33.059
debating whether or not
we discover evidence

31:33.092 --> 31:34.593
of extraterrestrial life within
the next couple of decades.

31:34.626 --> 31:36.929
You even made a bet
about it, didn't you?

31:36.963 --> 31:38.297
For one dollar.

31:38.330 --> 31:40.599
How could you
possibly know that?

31:40.632 --> 31:43.402
BRIAN:
On the one hand,
we have the skeptic

31:43.435 --> 31:45.071
Sturgeon Reid.

31:45.104 --> 31:48.074
Laying his money
and pride on the ETs,

31:48.107 --> 31:50.442
Dr. Ian Marshall.

31:50.476 --> 31:52.979
And you saw to it you were gonna
win that buck, didn't you?

31:53.012 --> 31:57.316
Uh, I'm not conceding
that such a bet even happened.

31:57.349 --> 31:59.986
BOYLE:
We don't need you to.

32:00.019 --> 32:01.988
Uh, we shared our concerns

32:02.021 --> 32:03.722
with the provost
of Walcott University,

32:03.755 --> 32:07.393
and she agreed to let us
take a look in your lab.

32:07.426 --> 32:09.528
We found trace amounts of the
bacteria causing the outages,

32:09.561 --> 32:11.130
some destroyed cultures.

32:11.163 --> 32:12.731
Care to explain?

32:12.764 --> 32:15.001
I'll get you started.

32:15.034 --> 32:16.102
You discovered
a species of bacteria

32:16.135 --> 32:18.470
that feeds on electrons,
but you kept it to yourself.

32:18.504 --> 32:21.440
You released a colony
in the financial district

32:21.473 --> 32:23.642
and timed that release with the
passage of the meteor shower,

32:23.675 --> 32:25.611
so people would start
thinking aliens.

32:25.644 --> 32:28.114
It's a clever plan,
dude, own it.

32:28.147 --> 32:30.749
Plus we already got you
kind of dead to rights, so...

32:30.782 --> 32:33.252
Actually, it was one
of my research assistants

32:33.285 --> 32:35.687
who discovered
the bacteria,

32:35.721 --> 32:40.092
but I convinced her
not to report it.

32:40.126 --> 32:41.727
I-I just wanted to win.

32:41.760 --> 32:44.630
And at some point you started
to want more than that.

32:44.663 --> 32:46.765
I'm sorry?

32:46.798 --> 32:48.367
The theft of $8 million

32:48.400 --> 32:50.502
from the Department
of Mutilated Money.

32:50.536 --> 32:53.372
Luis Vargas,
the security guard

32:53.405 --> 32:55.341
you murdered
two nights ago.

32:55.374 --> 32:57.476
BRIAN:
You caused the blackout,

32:57.509 --> 32:59.611
then used it as cover
to make yourself rich.

32:59.645 --> 33:00.779
He surprised you

33:00.812 --> 33:03.149
when you were
stealing the plans.
No, no, no, no, no.

33:03.182 --> 33:04.383
I am not a killer.

33:04.416 --> 33:06.385
I-I'm not a thief.

33:06.418 --> 33:07.519
I have tenure.

33:07.553 --> 33:09.388
Two nights ago?

33:09.421 --> 33:12.124
What time did this
murder happen?

33:12.158 --> 33:13.525
Time of death
is estimated

33:13.559 --> 33:15.261
between
9:00 and 11:00 p.m.

33:16.762 --> 33:18.797
Relax, Ian.

33:18.830 --> 33:21.433
Tuesday night, Dr. Marshall
and I gave a lecture

33:21.467 --> 33:23.135
together at
Columbia.

33:23.169 --> 33:26.805
1,400 students will attest
for our whereabouts.

33:26.838 --> 33:29.808
Uh, he may have planted
the bacteria...

33:29.841 --> 33:31.643
but Dr. Marshall

33:31.677 --> 33:33.545
didn't kill anyone.

33:44.823 --> 33:46.258
MAN (over radio):
Please avoid all streets
(horns honking)

33:46.292 --> 33:47.593
between Hoten and Grand,

33:47.626 --> 33:49.495
Allen and the East River.

33:49.528 --> 33:51.397
City officials has reopened
the Williamsburg Bridge

33:51.430 --> 33:52.764
and a checkpoint
WOMAN: Come on.

33:52.798 --> 33:54.233
has been reestablished,
Come on. Come on.

33:54.266 --> 33:57.169
causing major traffic delays.
(horn honking)

33:58.270 --> 33:59.338
BRIAN:
Hey, guys.

33:59.371 --> 34:00.506
How's it going?

34:00.539 --> 34:02.741
Oh, that's a dumb question.
It's not going.

34:02.774 --> 34:05.111
That's the thing about
standstill traffic, right?

34:05.144 --> 34:06.378
It's the pits.

34:06.412 --> 34:08.147
Corey Martinson?

34:08.180 --> 34:10.416
You're Ian Marshall's
research assistant.

34:10.449 --> 34:11.683
I'll take that as a yes.

34:11.717 --> 34:13.752
So we're from the FBI
and we just learned

34:13.785 --> 34:15.221
that your boss is the one

34:15.254 --> 34:16.788
behind the hoax
that paralyzed the city.

34:16.822 --> 34:18.557
And the way he tells it,

34:18.590 --> 34:20.459
you helped him fabricate
the bacteria that did it.

34:20.492 --> 34:23.329
Also, he said you
were his only partner.

34:23.362 --> 34:24.830
Would you be willing to
testify against your boss

34:24.863 --> 34:26.098
in the charges he faces?

34:26.132 --> 34:30.469
Um... I don't know.

34:30.502 --> 34:31.403
Wait, how did
you find me here?

34:31.437 --> 34:32.838
Here? Oh, we just waited
for you to show up.

34:32.871 --> 34:33.805
I mean, this is,
after all,

34:33.839 --> 34:35.574
the only way out of the city
at the moment.

34:35.607 --> 34:37.276
We at the FBI
kind of set it up that way.

34:37.309 --> 34:38.277
BOYLE:
Thing is,

34:38.310 --> 34:41.147
somebody used the blackout
to stage a robbery

34:41.180 --> 34:42.248
of the Department
of Mutilated Money.

34:42.281 --> 34:45.584
Someone, like, say,
an underpaid research assistant

34:45.617 --> 34:47.786
with crushing amounts
of student debt.

34:47.819 --> 34:49.388
Someone who saw her boss'
relatively harmless hoax

34:49.421 --> 34:51.590
as an opportunity.
BOYLE:
That same somebody

34:51.623 --> 34:53.259
had a cousin who did time
for armed robbery.

34:53.292 --> 34:54.092
Hi, Frank.

34:54.126 --> 34:55.727
Together, they came
up with a plan

34:55.761 --> 34:57.263
and they even ordered
a ridiculous amount

34:57.296 --> 34:59.298
of laundry detergents and
solvents from Amazon

34:59.331 --> 35:00.732
to clean the money
they stole.

35:00.766 --> 35:02.201
Any of this
sounding familiar?

35:02.234 --> 35:03.235
Of course not.

35:03.269 --> 35:04.703
BRIAN:
Now, would you two mind
if we took a look

35:04.736 --> 35:05.637
in the back
of this ambulance,

35:05.671 --> 35:07.506
no doubt rented
from a private EMS service

35:07.539 --> 35:09.441
to move about freely
in the quarantine?

35:11.877 --> 35:13.745
Hey, hey!

35:18.784 --> 35:21.153
Thank you.

35:21.187 --> 35:22.354
We weren't able
to get a warrant,

35:22.388 --> 35:23.355
with all the power being out.

35:23.389 --> 35:24.356
But that attempted escape

35:24.390 --> 35:26.358
is probable cause.

35:26.392 --> 35:27.759
And that, my friend,

35:27.793 --> 35:30.128
is irrefutable evidence.

35:34.433 --> 35:35.434
BOYLE:
What's it say?

35:38.270 --> 35:40.906
I wonder if anyone's ever
tried calling this number.

35:40.939 --> 35:42.508
Think there's
actually a good time

35:42.541 --> 35:43.609
at the end of this line?

35:43.642 --> 35:44.443
Huh? Should we call?

35:44.476 --> 35:47.213
You can give it a shot
if you want.

35:47.246 --> 35:49.248
I'm gonna go home, man.

35:51.817 --> 35:53.252
Hey, Brian.

35:53.285 --> 35:56.588
Pains me to say it,
but, uh...

35:56.622 --> 35:58.357
it's not the worst thing, huh?

35:58.390 --> 36:00.426
Us working together?

36:00.459 --> 36:02.728
BRIAN:
I didn't really
want to go home.

36:02.761 --> 36:04.663
I sure as hell didn't want
to go back to the CJC.

36:04.696 --> 36:07.266
There's only one place
I could think to go,

36:07.299 --> 36:09.268
the one place
people still love me.

36:09.301 --> 36:10.836
Because they have no choice.

36:12.438 --> 36:13.405
Hey, Cameron.

36:13.439 --> 36:14.340
You leaving already?

36:14.373 --> 36:15.741
I was hoping to catch
you guys for dinner.

36:15.774 --> 36:18.210
Yeah, we heard it shouldn't
be long before the
power's restored.

36:18.244 --> 36:20.412
Hey, if I were you,
I'd turn around now.

36:20.446 --> 36:21.680
What? Why?

36:21.713 --> 36:22.981
I don't know
what's going on,

36:23.014 --> 36:24.316
but I definitely
heard your name.

36:24.350 --> 36:26.352
So run while you can.

36:26.385 --> 36:28.387
(door closes)

36:34.025 --> 36:35.561
Hey, guys.

36:35.594 --> 36:36.662
What's going on?

36:36.695 --> 36:38.264
Sit down, Brian.

36:40.499 --> 36:41.833
Okay.

36:41.867 --> 36:44.703
That sounds ominous.

36:48.507 --> 36:49.941
Mom?

36:49.975 --> 36:52.411
Are you okay?

36:52.444 --> 36:54.813
You know, Brian...

36:54.846 --> 36:58.450
I always knew that you had
something special about you.

36:58.484 --> 36:59.918
A good heart.

36:59.951 --> 37:03.455
You were sensitive,
you cared about other people.

37:03.489 --> 37:04.590
Even if you were
being impulsive,

37:04.623 --> 37:06.425
even if the things
you were doing

37:06.458 --> 37:08.694
looked selfish
on the face of it.

37:10.596 --> 37:11.863
I believed in that

37:11.897 --> 37:14.900
light that was in you so much

37:14.933 --> 37:18.003
that, uh,
I let a lot of things slip by.

37:18.036 --> 37:19.538
Finding pot
in your jeans

37:19.571 --> 37:21.373
when you left them out
for me to wash as usual.

37:21.407 --> 37:22.608
Mom, come on...

37:22.641 --> 37:24.276
No. Let me finish.

37:24.310 --> 37:25.544
(sighs)

37:25.577 --> 37:27.045
I figured

37:27.078 --> 37:29.715
that we would find some kind
of balance, you know?

37:29.748 --> 37:30.982
Your father would

37:31.016 --> 37:32.884
give you discipline,
some structure;

37:32.918 --> 37:34.786
I would give you room to run

37:34.820 --> 37:35.721
so you could
figure things out.

37:35.754 --> 37:37.789
And I honestly thought

37:37.823 --> 37:39.991
that's what was
happening to you now.

37:40.025 --> 37:43.862
I thought, maybe he's finally
figured it out.

37:46.565 --> 37:48.767
Ugh. What an idiot I was.

37:48.800 --> 37:49.768
Come on, Mom, you...

37:49.801 --> 37:50.802
No.

37:50.836 --> 37:53.772
What the hell are these?
Geez.

37:53.805 --> 37:56.041
You want to tell me
about them?

37:56.074 --> 37:57.509
Because your father won't.

37:57.543 --> 37:58.777
We've been married for 42 years

37:58.810 --> 38:00.646
and there has never
been a single thing

38:00.679 --> 38:02.047
that we could not discuss.

38:02.080 --> 38:03.949
So whatever these are

38:03.982 --> 38:05.884
must be serious.

38:05.917 --> 38:07.619
Dad.

38:07.653 --> 38:09.555
Oh, no. This is between
you and your mother.

38:09.588 --> 38:12.391
You brought this into our home.

38:12.424 --> 38:14.660
No, I didn't.
No, I didn't.

38:14.693 --> 38:16.094
The moment you got
your sister into this,

38:16.127 --> 38:18.096
you did.

38:18.129 --> 38:20.366
Leaving these pills lying
around, having her come

38:20.399 --> 38:23.402
to that safe house that you
have been mysteriously given.

38:23.435 --> 38:24.936
You put your sister
in danger.

38:24.970 --> 38:25.937
No, I haven't.

38:25.971 --> 38:27.739
Undercover agents coming over,

38:27.773 --> 38:29.040
bleeding out
on the kitchen table.

38:30.742 --> 38:32.043
Rachel.

38:32.077 --> 38:33.111
MARIE:
Brian, no.

38:33.144 --> 38:35.847
I am not turning
a blind eye anymore.

38:35.881 --> 38:37.883
I don't know
what these pills are.

38:37.916 --> 38:38.984
I don't want to know.

38:39.017 --> 38:40.886
And I don't want our family

38:40.919 --> 38:42.087
any deeper in this

38:42.120 --> 38:44.322
than we already are.

38:53.799 --> 38:55.367
Mom...

38:55.401 --> 38:56.768
I can't tell you everything,
but I can explain...

38:56.802 --> 38:58.804
Brian, no.
I don't want any more excuses.

38:58.837 --> 39:02.508
Because unless you start
making some different choices,

39:02.541 --> 39:04.009
you are not welcome here.

39:06.478 --> 39:08.714
I love you, Brian, but...

39:08.747 --> 39:11.149
just...

39:11.182 --> 39:12.618
no.

39:20.659 --> 39:24.496
* Paper cup of the boat

39:26.432 --> 39:29.635
* Heaving chest of the sea

39:31.169 --> 39:34.105
* Carry both of us

39:34.139 --> 39:38.143
* Carry her, carry me

39:41.046 --> 39:44.916
* From the place we were born

39:46.652 --> 39:50.656
* To the land of the free

39:52.023 --> 39:54.626
* Carry both of us

39:54.660 --> 39:58.430
* Carry her, carry me

39:58.464 --> 40:00.065
Oh...

40:00.098 --> 40:01.867
God...

40:01.900 --> 40:05.003
* Moving silent her lips

40:06.672 --> 40:10.408
* By the moon's only light

40:11.943 --> 40:14.913
* Sowing silver prayers

40:14.946 --> 40:17.683
* In the blanket of night.

40:19.785 --> 40:21.787
*

40:31.930 --> 40:34.032
MIKE:
Just go do it.

40:34.065 --> 40:35.867
It ain't gonna get any easier,
you sitting here.

40:35.901 --> 40:37.536
I-I know.

40:37.569 --> 40:38.804
It just...
You're gonna miss her.

40:38.837 --> 40:39.938
Go.

40:39.971 --> 40:41.573
Get out of the car!

40:43.609 --> 40:44.776
Rachel.

40:44.810 --> 40:46.211
Hey.

40:46.244 --> 40:47.212
Listen...

40:47.245 --> 40:48.547
Jason, I'm sorry.

40:48.580 --> 40:50.716
I... I should've
stayed in touch.

40:50.749 --> 40:52.751
And I was weird to you
at my parents', I know.

40:52.784 --> 40:54.753
It's just, things
have been strange.
I'm not here to talk about that.

40:54.786 --> 40:55.954
Oh, okay.

40:55.987 --> 40:58.490
Your mom mentioned
an undercover agent,

40:58.524 --> 41:00.058
that he showed up at Brian's
apartment, bleeding out.

41:00.091 --> 41:01.560
Yeah?

41:01.593 --> 41:04.062
Could you describe him for me?

41:11.703 --> 41:13.605
Banker's hours today?

41:15.607 --> 41:18.710
"F" Train, there was
some kind of delay.

41:18.744 --> 41:20.011
I need to talk to Brian.

41:20.045 --> 41:21.246
Not in yet.

41:21.279 --> 41:22.814
I guess he took the same train.

41:29.888 --> 41:31.723
(phone beeps)

41:33.759 --> 41:35.226
BRIAN (recording):
I can't come to the phone
right now,

41:35.260 --> 41:36.695
but if this is an emergency,

41:36.728 --> 41:37.996
you can try Rebecca Harris
any time.

41:38.029 --> 41:39.765
(phone beeps)

41:55.346 --> 41:56.748
BRIAN:
Hey.

41:56.782 --> 41:58.183
Thought about stopping by,

41:58.216 --> 42:00.719
but I figured you'd seen
enough of me lately.

42:00.752 --> 42:02.954
You should know a few things.

42:02.988 --> 42:04.690
I'm sorry
for the things I said.

42:04.723 --> 42:05.891
You deserve better than that.

42:05.924 --> 42:08.093
Whatever else happens,

42:08.126 --> 42:10.796
you saw potential in me
that no one else ever did.

42:10.829 --> 42:13.932
It's not just the pill
that changed my life, it's you.

42:13.965 --> 42:15.266
So, thanks for that.

42:15.300 --> 42:17.102
Things may get
a little crazy for a while.

42:18.804 --> 42:20.772
I know I haven't given back

42:20.806 --> 42:23.074
as much as you've given me.

42:23.108 --> 42:24.976
There's probably
no way I ever could.

42:25.010 --> 42:27.979
But starting now,
I'm going to try.

42:30.949 --> 42:32.350
And in order to try,

42:32.383 --> 42:33.985
I've got to do a few things.

42:34.019 --> 42:37.022
So you may not hear
from me for a minute.

42:37.055 --> 42:40.325
I think I have a way
to make some of this okay.

42:42.093 --> 42:44.996
And if it all works out,
I'll see you in a few days.

42:45.030 --> 42:46.932
And if it doesn't?
Well...

42:46.965 --> 42:49.701
we had some lulz, right?

42:58.043 --> 43:00.045
