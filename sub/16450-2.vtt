accidentally posted it.

10:27.030 --> 10:28.410
I guess it's over.

10:28.410 --> 10:30.740
So you fractured your
sternum, your scapula,

10:30.740 --> 10:33.020
and your left tibia, but
nothing life-threatening.

10:33.020 --> 10:34.970
You should be fully-healed
in a couple of months.

10:34.970 --> 10:37.970
And look, it's OK if you
can't do the full cleanse.

10:37.970 --> 10:41.450
Using human food in moderation
is a good enough goal for now.

10:41.450 --> 10:42.440
Do you understand?

10:42.440 --> 10:43.290
Yes.

10:43.290 --> 10:44.620
Whew.

10:44.620 --> 10:45.560
Lollipop?

10:45.560 --> 10:47.030
No, thank you.

10:47.030 --> 10:50.210
By the way, how's your
other brother's diet going?

10:50.210 --> 10:51.170
Uh, not sure.

10:55.150 --> 10:58.140

hedgehog beats for today.

11:38.930 --> 11:41.620
Mmm-- check out this

Hello?

11:50.810 --> 11:52.240
Ah!

11:52.240 --> 11:54.390
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

11:54.390 --> 11:55.580
Bang.

11:55.580 --> 11:56.370
Bang.

11:56.370 --> 12:00.820
[LAUGHS] That was an
A-plus bang scare.

12:00.820 --> 12:02.570
Uh, why do people
like this guy?

12:02.570 --> 12:03.350
He's the worst.

12:03.350 --> 12:04.190
Is he gone?

12:04.190 --> 12:07.340
OK, let's watch
something else.

12:07.340 --> 12:09.290
Huh-- new Nom Nom video.

12:09.290 --> 12:12.250
That guy is kind of the worst,
too, after all he's done to us.

12:12.250 --> 12:13.610
Ice Bear grudge still strong.

12:13.610 --> 12:17.350
Yeah, but he's still
adorable and awesome.

12:17.350 --> 12:18.640
Whee.

12:18.640 --> 12:19.360
Whew.

12:19.360 --> 12:20.890
Ice bear still doesn't like.

12:20.890 --> 12:22.580
You know, both these
guys have tons of hits

12:22.580 --> 12:23.740
and millions of followers.

12:23.740 --> 12:25.890
I wonder if they
know each other?

12:25.890 --> 12:27.920
I want the organic eucalyptus
leaves this time-- none

12:27.920 --> 12:29.600
of that synthetic junk anymore.

12:29.600 --> 12:30.820
Also, make sure
it's on the branch.

12:30.820 --> 12:32.080
I refuse to eat plated leaves.

12:32.080 --> 12:34.240
And make sure my stylist
is available next week.

12:34.240 --> 12:36.340
I swear, I am going
to lose my-- oof.

12:36.340 --> 12:37.770

Hey, what's the--

12:37.770 --> 12:40.280
Well, look who it
is, little old Num Num.

12:40.280 --> 12:42.140
Yeah, you tell him, AB.

12:42.140 --> 12:43.570
You should look where
you're going, Nums.

12:43.570 --> 12:44.600
You could hurt yourself.

12:44.600 --> 12:46.640
You watch where
you're going, Andy.

12:46.640 --> 12:48.470
Shouldn't you be hiding
in a stroller somewhere?

12:48.470 --> 12:50.900
You know, I would use
yours but it looks like baby

12:52.670 --> 12:53.900
Oh, snap.

12:53.900 --> 12:55.370
Say, what you got here anyway?

12:55.370 --> 12:57.060
Is this your weak
sauce entourage?

12:57.060 --> 12:58.520
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

12:58.520 --> 13:01.450
Don't you know your entourage
is supposed to be cool, Nums?

13:01.450 --> 13:04.400
I bet they can't even
give you high fives.

13:04.400 --> 13:05.750
You're wrong, Andy.

13:05.750 --> 13:07.790
Back me up.

13:07.790 --> 13:10.310
Uh, we could sue.

13:16.180 --> 13:17.870
Oh, oh, here it comes.

13:17.870 --> 13:19.980
Maybe we should
call a waaam-bulance.

Oh, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo.

- I, you need a--
- No, no, no.

13:24.050 --> 13:25.760
Maybe we should call
the fire department

13:25.760 --> 13:28.290
to treat all these sick burns.
- Oh.

13:28.290 --> 13:29.260
Hoo hoo.

13:29.260 --> 13:30.230
No, you didn't.

13:30.230 --> 13:32.330
Ah, well, it's been
fun catching up, Nums.

13:32.330 --> 13:34.940
But my real entourage
and I have to get going.

Those are my sunglasses.

Oh.

13:40.060 --> 13:40.880
What was that?

13:40.880 --> 13:42.870
You couldn't even think
of one cool thing to say?

13:42.870 --> 13:44.600
What do I pay you for?

13:44.600 --> 13:45.740
I'm your accountant.

13:45.740 --> 13:46.670

13:46.670 --> 13:48.420

Oh, useless-- I can't
afford another blow

13:51.380 --> 13:52.490
like that to my street cred.

13:52.490 --> 13:53.820
If I'm going to
compete with Andy,

13:53.820 --> 13:55.640
I'm going to need
an actual entourage,

13:55.640 --> 13:59.300
but where to find
the right people?

13:59.300 --> 14:00.000
Hmm.

can't stop thinking

14:05.600 --> 14:07.340

14:07.340 --> 14:09.610
I feel like he could pop
out and scare us, too.

14:09.610 --> 14:11.870
He could be lurking anywhere.

14:11.870 --> 14:14.740

minute out here in the open.

no Andy Bangs here.

Oh, no.

14:31.400 --> 14:33.530
So glad you could make it.

14:33.530 --> 14:35.450
I do apologize
for the dramatics,

14:35.450 --> 14:38.050

that-- you understand.

What do you want, Nom Nom.

14:39.550 --> 14:40.250
I'll be honest.

I know I may have been a
jerk to you guys in the past.

kidnapping thing just now?

14:44.840 --> 14:46.280

14:46.280 --> 14:47.100
I'll get to the point.

14:47.100 --> 14:49.640
I am in need of a new entourage.

14:49.640 --> 14:51.860
My previous crew was useless.

14:51.860 --> 14:54.500

hype and high fives

14:54.500 --> 14:56.690
and generally
elevate my coolness.

you will help me

have backed me up.

of us not so much as employees,

maybe more like friends.

Hello, Andrew.

19:56.890 --> 19:59.140
I'm surprised you showed
up with your sad excuse

19:59.140 --> 19:59.860
of an entourage.

19:59.860 --> 20:01.350
Oh.

20:01.350 --> 20:02.350
Snap.

20:02.350 --> 20:03.940
The only sad thing
here is the amount

20:03.940 --> 20:05.280
of views on your last video.

20:05.280 --> 20:08.070
Oh.

20:08.070 --> 20:11.100
Yeah, well, all my
fans would say different.

20:11.100 --> 20:14.370
Your preschool class
doesn't count as fans.

20:14.370 --> 20:16.410
At least he went to preschool.

20:16.410 --> 20:18.940
Education at a young
age is fundamental.

Andy, your teeth
are so big, you got

20:20.420 --> 20:21.420
to floss with a piece of rope.

20:21.420 --> 20:23.640
Oh!

20:23.640 --> 20:25.500
Your voice is so high,
only dogs can hear it.

20:25.500 --> 20:26.490
Oh!

20:26.490 --> 20:27.840
You're so short,
they won't even

20:27.840 --> 20:29.620
let you inside the theme park.

20:29.620 --> 20:30.610

Whoa, a little harsh, huh?

20:39.410 --> 20:40.430
What's the matter, Andy?

20:40.430 --> 20:41.930
Can't your crew back you up?

20:41.930 --> 20:43.850
Oh, I have a crew
that can back me up.

Where's Nom Nom.
Guys, he ditched us.

20:59.700 --> 21:01.070
Oh, I thought we were friends.

21:01.070 --> 21:02.350
What a jerk.
- Fight.

Hold on, guys.

21:06.280 --> 21:07.210
This is totally unnecessary.

21:07.210 --> 21:08.300
We're all cool here, right?

21:08.300 --> 21:10.680
Look at you with your
sunglasses-- so cool.

Were you just using
us the whole time?

21:41.910 --> 21:43.770
I thought we were friends.
- We were.

through, I'm no longer
