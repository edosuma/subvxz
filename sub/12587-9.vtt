<b><font color="#0E7521">Ripped By mstoll</font></b>

00:32.698 --> 00:34.497
I'm starting to worry.

00:34.785 --> 00:36.708
Mr. Strickland's
been in his office

00:36.703 --> 00:39.047
with the door shut
for more than an hour.

00:39.039 --> 00:41.792
Maybe he's passed out
drunk on his mini-toilet.

00:41.792 --> 00:43.794
Maybe he's stone-cold dead.

00:43.794 --> 00:46.468
Dang it, I'm going in.

00:46.463 --> 00:49.512
Take the defibrillator, honey.

00:50.592 --> 00:53.015
People, I've been on the horn

00:53.011 --> 00:55.685
with the National Propane Gas
Consortium.

00:55.847 --> 00:57.394
Y'all are looking

00:57.391 --> 01:01.646
at the newest inductee
into the Propane Hall of Flame.

01:01.645 --> 01:02.692
Oh, my Lord, sir.

01:02.854 --> 01:05.949
That's the highest achievement
possible in propane.

01:05.941 --> 01:08.364
I'm at the top of the mountain
all right.

01:08.360 --> 01:11.409
And you're my...
What do you call them goat men

01:11.405 --> 01:13.282
that keep you
from freezing to death?

01:13.282 --> 01:15.159
You're his Sherpa, honey.

01:15.158 --> 01:17.786
That's right,
and to show my appreciation,

01:17.786 --> 01:21.791
I want you to introduce me
at the induction ceremony

01:21.790 --> 01:25.465
at the national convention
next week in Memphis.

01:25.460 --> 01:28.805
This is the greatest honor
I will ever know.

01:28.797 --> 01:30.344
Let's celebrate.

01:30.340 --> 01:31.967
Who wants breakfast whiskey?

01:38.390 --> 01:41.109
Tell me about the sport coat
again, Dad.

01:41.101 --> 01:44.731
The Hall of Flame honoree gets
to wear a special blazer

01:44.730 --> 01:46.357
at the induction ceremony.

01:46.356 --> 01:49.735
It's graduated in color
like a flame itself...

01:49.901 --> 01:52.495
Bright blue at the bottom,
then bright red,

01:52.487 --> 01:54.706
then bright orange,
then bright yellow,

01:54.865 --> 01:57.709
and then bright white
at the shoulders and collar.

01:57.868 --> 02:00.166
Do you get to wear one, too?

02:00.162 --> 02:01.709
No, son.

02:01.705 --> 02:04.800
Standing next to Buck Strickland
in his moment of glory is

02:04.791 --> 02:06.714
probably as close
as I'll ever get

02:06.710 --> 02:08.804
to wearing the rainbow blazer.

02:08.794 --> 02:11.264
The rainbow blazer.

02:11.256 --> 02:13.759
I don't know, Peggy,

02:13.759 --> 02:17.059
this is the greatest moment
in Strickland Propane history,

02:17.054 --> 02:19.307
but what if Buck blows it?

02:19.306 --> 02:21.684
What if he gives in
to his appetites?

02:21.850 --> 02:23.227
Do not worry, Hank.

02:23.226 --> 02:25.729
You have kept him out of trouble
for 23 years.

02:25.896 --> 02:28.775
If anyone can shield
Buck Strickland from booze

02:28.774 --> 02:32.779
and women at a convention
in a good-time town, it's you,

02:32.778 --> 02:36.954
but if you need me for backup,
I am an expert fun-blocker.

02:38.033 --> 02:40.627
Yeah, between the two of us,

02:40.619 --> 02:42.166
we can handle Buck.

02:57.135 --> 02:59.763
I can't believe I'm really here.

02:59.763 --> 03:02.767
This is my Super Bowl, Peggy.

03:02.766 --> 03:05.440
Mr. and Mrs. Hill?

03:05.435 --> 03:07.278
I'm Melanie Scovall.

03:07.270 --> 03:09.489
I'll be your convention liaison.

03:09.481 --> 03:12.109
Now where's the man of honor,
Mr. Strickland?

03:12.109 --> 03:15.363
Ugh, I've lost visual contact.

03:15.362 --> 03:16.784
Red alert, Peggy.

03:16.780 --> 03:17.781
I'll check the bar.

03:17.781 --> 03:20.079
Oh, there he is.

03:20.075 --> 03:21.201
Stand at attention, men.

03:21.201 --> 03:22.794
Hall of Flamer coming through.

03:23.912 --> 03:26.210
The years have been good
to you, John.

03:26.206 --> 03:29.130
You're a more distinguished kind
of ugly.

03:31.795 --> 03:35.265
Peggy, I think I was worried
about Buck for nothing.

03:35.257 --> 03:37.055
It's past noon, he's not drunk,

03:37.050 --> 03:39.929
and he's got people
eating out of his hand.

03:39.928 --> 03:43.478
This right here is
Hall of Flame Buck Strickland.

03:43.473 --> 03:45.692
Honey, you are doing fine
without me.

03:45.684 --> 03:48.107
I have a ladies'
prayer breakfast to attend.

03:48.103 --> 03:49.696
Please don't forget to register

03:49.855 --> 03:51.698
for the grand prize
in our raffle.

03:51.857 --> 03:53.780
Strickland Propane?

03:53.775 --> 03:57.655
Aw, shoot, I requested a booth
next to the men's room.

03:57.654 --> 03:58.951
This can't be right.

03:58.947 --> 04:00.244
Good Lord, sir,

04:00.240 --> 04:02.789
there are
two Strickland Propanes.

04:02.784 --> 04:04.786
Strickland Propane...
Arlen, Texas...

04:04.786 --> 04:08.131
And Strickland Propane...
Gatlinburg, Tennessee.

04:10.751 --> 04:12.799
Thank y'all for visiting
Strickland Propane.

04:12.794 --> 04:14.796
Don't taste the heat;
taste the meat.

04:14.796 --> 04:16.012
Dang it.

04:16.005 --> 04:18.725
What in the Sam Hill
is going on here?

04:18.884 --> 04:22.764
You're using my name and
about 90% of my slogan.

04:22.763 --> 04:25.767
Are you
the great Buck Strickland?

04:25.766 --> 04:27.768
None other.
Who're you?

04:27.768 --> 04:30.772
Sir, I've waited
all my life to meet you.

04:30.771 --> 04:32.739
I'm your bastard son.

04:34.608 --> 04:36.360
Well, I'll be dogged.

04:37.611 --> 04:41.957
Hank, this here's
my son... er, uh, Ray?

04:41.948 --> 04:44.246
Uh, Roy?

04:44.242 --> 04:46.415
Uh, Ray Roy?

04:46.411 --> 04:48.755
My name's Jody, but you can
call me whatever you want.

04:48.914 --> 04:51.667
The important part of my name
is Strickland.

04:51.666 --> 04:53.794
Well, Ray Roy,

04:53.794 --> 04:56.764
what do you say to your
old man buying you a drink?

04:56.755 --> 04:59.759
Just one? Shoot,
I'm ready to drink you broke.

05:05.180 --> 05:08.730
But sir, uh, w-we've
got to set up our booth.

05:08.892 --> 05:10.735
Cover for me.

05:24.783 --> 05:26.785
So what's the bastard like?

05:27.786 --> 05:29.459
Well, the apple didn't fall far

05:29.454 --> 05:31.673
from Mr. Strickland's tree,
I tell you what.

05:31.665 --> 05:33.292
They hadn't been together
two minutes

05:33.291 --> 05:34.793
when they went off drinking.

05:34.793 --> 05:36.795
I'm afraid I might have
to keep 'em apart

05:36.795 --> 05:39.799
for the good of Buck
and Strickland Propane.

05:39.798 --> 05:42.301
Hmm, you want to keep
Buck Strickland

05:42.300 --> 05:44.473
away from his own son.

05:44.469 --> 05:46.722
Admit it, Hank, you're jealous.

05:46.721 --> 05:48.519
You just want to be
the bastard son

05:48.515 --> 05:51.359
Buck Strickland never had
but apparently did.

05:51.351 --> 05:52.728
Why would I want
to be Buck's son

05:52.894 --> 05:55.363
when I'm his assistant manager?

05:55.355 --> 05:58.575
Hmm, translation:
"Love me, Daddy."

06:00.652 --> 06:02.450
Don't forget to register

06:02.445 --> 06:04.447
for the grand prize
in our raffle.

06:04.447 --> 06:06.040
Thank goodness you're back.

06:06.032 --> 06:08.251
I was getting worried.

06:08.243 --> 06:10.166
There's my body spray.

06:10.161 --> 06:11.413
Come on, Pop.

06:11.413 --> 06:12.756
Let's get back in the funk.

06:12.914 --> 06:14.791
You got it, turkey.

06:14.791 --> 06:17.169
W-Wait, wait, sir,
where are you going?

06:17.168 --> 06:18.715
Oh, we going to, uh...

06:18.879 --> 06:20.802
Son, what's the bad part
of Memphis called?

06:20.797 --> 06:21.798
Memphis.

06:21.798 --> 06:23.766
Yeah, that's where we headed.

06:23.758 --> 06:26.432
But sir, people are
coming here to see you.

06:26.428 --> 06:27.771
Mr. Strickland,

06:27.762 --> 06:30.766
we've got a reception
in the Crystal Room at 3:00 p.m.

06:30.765 --> 06:32.984
where you'll be
the guest of honor.

06:32.976 --> 06:34.774
You hear that, sir?
3:00.

06:34.769 --> 06:35.736
He'll be there.

06:35.896 --> 06:39.776
Well, lookie-lookie,
there goes a tookie.

06:39.774 --> 06:42.368
Sorry, Papa got dibs
on that one.

06:42.360 --> 06:43.782
Stand in line, squirt.

06:43.778 --> 06:45.371
Whatever you say, Pop.

06:45.363 --> 06:47.115
Let's smack this town's bottom.

06:47.115 --> 06:48.207
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

06:48.199 --> 06:50.076
Sir, we're in the middle
of important...

06:55.582 --> 06:58.461
This your first ladies'
prayer breakfast?

06:58.460 --> 06:59.507
Yes, it is.

06:59.502 --> 07:01.596
I'll let you in on
a little secret.

07:01.588 --> 07:04.307
The object here isn't to
get close to the Lord.

07:04.299 --> 07:07.178
It's to get close to
the Platinum Circle.

07:09.054 --> 07:12.649
Ah, yes,
the first ladies of propane.

07:12.641 --> 07:15.315
Tru Wigant, Wendy Fortner,

07:15.310 --> 07:18.655
Jane Ann Kuykendall,
and... wait.

07:18.647 --> 07:19.648
Where's Bebe Wren?

07:19.648 --> 07:21.195
Oh, she's not a wife now.

07:21.191 --> 07:22.363
She's an owner...

07:22.359 --> 07:23.952
ever since her husband
Buddy dropped dead

07:23.944 --> 07:26.197
at the carving station
at The Brown Cow.

07:27.238 --> 07:31.493
So the Platinum Circle
has an opening? Hmm...

07:31.493 --> 07:34.793
Be sure to register
at the hospitality desk in the west...

07:34.788 --> 07:36.461
Buck Strickland a no-show?

07:36.456 --> 07:37.457
No problem.

07:37.457 --> 07:40.301
Meet friends of Buck Strickland.

07:40.293 --> 07:44.093
I'm sorry Buck's not here,
Ms. Scovall.

07:44.089 --> 07:46.433
He was at a Q and
A session, and, uh,

07:46.424 --> 07:49.928
wouldn't you know he got more
"Q" s than he bargained for.

07:49.928 --> 07:52.477
I'll see that he shows up
from now on.

07:52.472 --> 07:55.225
Your boss should take
conventions more seriously.

07:55.225 --> 07:58.980
The United States Constitution
was written at a convention.

08:00.480 --> 08:03.324
This is Mr. Strickland's
Hall of Flame jacket.

08:06.111 --> 08:10.116
I'm entrusting you with it until
the ceremony tomorrow night.

08:10.115 --> 08:12.584
Do not make me regret it.

08:12.575 --> 08:15.499
The rainbow blazer.

08:27.465 --> 08:29.513
I am Peggy Hill.

08:29.509 --> 08:31.136
My husband Hank is introducing

08:31.136 --> 08:34.309
the newest Hall of Flame
inductee, Buck Strickland.

08:34.304 --> 08:35.773
I'm supposed to be impressed?

08:35.765 --> 08:37.984
My husband Pollard is
the president

08:37.976 --> 08:41.105
of the National Propane Gas
Consortium.

08:41.104 --> 08:42.777
Okay.

08:42.772 --> 08:45.446
I am bested but not rattled.

08:45.442 --> 08:47.786
Peggy, you had the guts
to sit there.

08:47.777 --> 08:50.747
You can stay
till your luck runs out.

08:52.323 --> 08:54.872
Deal me in.

08:58.246 --> 09:01.796
Shirley Temple,
meet Mr. Roy Rogers.

09:02.959 --> 09:05.132
Ah... yeah.

09:05.128 --> 09:06.380
Look at that fool,

09:06.379 --> 09:09.849
looking all around like,
like a stupid squirrel.

09:13.636 --> 09:15.730
That's my dad.

09:19.601 --> 09:20.602
Buck, Buck.

09:20.602 --> 09:21.774
You didn't show up

09:21.770 --> 09:23.067
for your meet-and-greet.

09:23.063 --> 09:26.784
Yeah, I was meeting and greeting
a few cocktail waitresses.

09:26.775 --> 09:29.779
Look, I know you want to
spend time with your son...

09:29.778 --> 09:31.780
The cat's in the
cradle and whatnot...

09:31.780 --> 09:34.784
But the prestige of
the Hall of Flame comes

09:34.783 --> 09:36.330
with certain obligations.

09:37.619 --> 09:40.589
Come on, Daddy,
we got us a lady sandwich.

09:40.580 --> 09:42.753
Well, Hank, got to skedaddle.

09:48.671 --> 09:51.390
Buck and Ray Roy
are getting out of control.

09:51.382 --> 09:54.556
Peggy, they mooned Elvis's grave

09:54.552 --> 09:57.601
and his poor little
dead twin brother Jesse.

09:57.597 --> 09:59.725
Well, you'd better figure out
a way to handle those two.

09:59.891 --> 10:02.019
While not impossible,
you cannot count

10:02.018 --> 10:04.316
on one of them to
choke on his own vomit.

10:08.483 --> 10:10.781
Mr. Strickland,
we need to talk.

10:10.777 --> 10:12.370
Oh, for crying out loud,

10:12.362 --> 10:16.037
it's, it's, well,
it's 2:00 in the afternoon.

10:16.032 --> 10:18.535
Yes, in six hours, you're
supposed to be inducted

10:18.535 --> 10:21.084
into the Propane Hall of Flame,

10:21.079 --> 10:23.502
and I'm not sure
you're going to make it.

10:23.498 --> 10:24.795
I'm not sure you should.

10:24.791 --> 10:26.634
Dang it, I'm trying, Hank,

10:26.626 --> 10:28.799
but I've got
to make it up to my boy

10:28.795 --> 10:31.298
for neglecting him
all these years.

10:31.297 --> 10:33.800
He got into propane
'cause of me.

10:33.800 --> 10:35.552
So did I, sir.

10:37.679 --> 10:40.558
I am violating all
kinds of protocol here,

10:40.557 --> 10:42.935
but I want you to
try on this jacket.

10:46.604 --> 10:48.606
Well, that feels nice.

10:48.606 --> 10:50.074
If you want to wear the jacket,

10:50.066 --> 10:51.943
you've got to live the jacket.

10:53.027 --> 10:55.280
All right, Ol' Top,

10:55.280 --> 10:57.282
I'll straighten up.

11:02.787 --> 11:05.165
Gotdog! Ray Roy!

11:05.165 --> 11:07.884
Now, I hope
you got two girls in there!

11:10.670 --> 11:11.796
What the...?!

11:11.796 --> 11:13.890
I told you to stand in line!

11:13.882 --> 11:16.476
You didn't stand in line, boy!

11:16.467 --> 11:18.640
Hell, Daddy,
that line was moving too slow.

11:18.636 --> 11:20.104
I just had to do cut-sies!

11:20.096 --> 11:21.598
Cut... Why you son of a...

11:24.559 --> 11:25.776
Oh, no.

11:28.688 --> 11:29.985
Yeah!

11:29.981 --> 11:31.073
Yeah! RAY ROY: Ow!

11:32.192 --> 11:33.239
Ow!

11:36.779 --> 11:38.747
I have had enough!

11:40.158 --> 11:43.458
Oh, Hank, we were just
letting off a little steam.

11:43.453 --> 11:45.455
I have tried with all my might

11:45.455 --> 11:47.799
to save you from yourself,
Mr. Strickland.

11:47.790 --> 11:49.713
Well, not anymore.

11:49.709 --> 11:50.961
You're on your own.

11:50.960 --> 11:53.179
You should be ashamed
of yourselves.

11:53.171 --> 11:55.265
And that includes you,
Ms. Scovall.

11:55.256 --> 11:58.385
You have not honored propane.

12:02.138 --> 12:04.140
He's right.

12:04.140 --> 12:06.768
I should be ashamed of myself.

12:06.768 --> 12:09.738
But I never am.

12:12.357 --> 12:14.155
Hey, Hank.

12:15.735 --> 12:17.783
Long Island iced tea?

12:17.779 --> 12:20.328
I can't believe those words
came out of your mouth.

12:20.323 --> 12:22.166
Or did you point to the menu?

12:22.158 --> 12:23.501
How did it go down?

12:23.493 --> 12:25.120
Keep an eye on your friend.

12:25.119 --> 12:26.541
He's tore up pretty bad.

12:26.537 --> 12:28.790
Usually, it's a woman involved,
but apparently,

12:28.790 --> 12:31.794
a couple of dudes named
Strickland did it to him.

12:31.793 --> 12:35.263
I don't ever want to hear
the name Strickland again.

12:35.255 --> 12:36.802
What are you talking about?

12:36.798 --> 12:39.472
This whole thing is because
your name <i>isn't</i> Strickland.

12:39.467 --> 12:42.141
You think I'm jealous
of Buck and Ray Roy?

12:42.136 --> 12:43.479
Who cares?

12:43.471 --> 12:44.723
I sure don't.

12:44.722 --> 12:47.316
Now, Hank, that's just
the rum and tequila

12:47.308 --> 12:48.981
and vodka and gin talking.

12:48.977 --> 12:51.526
I'm gonna give that S.O.B.
an introduction

12:51.521 --> 12:53.649
he'll never forget.

12:57.777 --> 13:01.782
We're here to honor one
of the giants of Texas propane,

13:01.781 --> 13:03.704
Mr. Buck Strickland.

13:03.866 --> 13:08.292
To introduce Mr. Strickland,
his right-hand man, Hank Hill.

13:14.961 --> 13:17.259
I'm not gonna say...

13:17.255 --> 13:20.759
Hell, I am gonna say
what I have been wanting to say.

13:21.759 --> 13:24.478
Buck Strickland is a monster.

13:24.470 --> 13:26.689
A drunk monster.

13:26.848 --> 13:29.772
Buck Strickland is nothing
but a lecherous,

13:29.767 --> 13:33.112
disgusting,
bastard-making bastard...

13:39.777 --> 13:42.747
And now I'm going to vomit.

13:55.793 --> 13:57.340
God, I don't know what happened.

13:57.337 --> 13:59.305
I just snapped.

13:59.297 --> 14:02.301
Now the Board of Governors
is having a special session

14:02.300 --> 14:04.678
this afternoon
to determine my punishment.

14:04.677 --> 14:06.679
It is just not right

14:06.679 --> 14:09.398
that Buck Strickland has been a
drunken boor his whole life,

14:09.390 --> 14:12.064
and you, his white knight, are
the one who's in trouble.

14:12.060 --> 14:13.778
I am so sorry, Peggy.

14:13.770 --> 14:16.774
I guess this has probably
put you in a tough spot

14:16.773 --> 14:17.740
with the Platinum Circle.

14:17.899 --> 14:19.401
Yeah, well, that dream died

14:19.400 --> 14:21.528
when you threw up
in Tru Wigant's hair.

14:21.527 --> 14:23.905
But I am not gonna
let your career die.

14:26.949 --> 14:28.747
Daddy...

14:28.743 --> 14:30.336
I-I feel awful
about trading paint

14:30.328 --> 14:31.750
with what's-her-face.

14:31.746 --> 14:35.125
Oh, hell, son, if we can
get past me abandoning you

14:35.124 --> 14:37.718
and never supporting you,
we can get past this.

14:37.710 --> 14:39.804
What do you say we call it even?

14:39.796 --> 14:40.797
Fair enough.

14:45.760 --> 14:48.058
Oh, hell,
this ain't gonna be good.

14:48.054 --> 14:50.398
Because of your
shameful behavior,

14:50.390 --> 14:51.767
my husband is in danger

14:51.766 --> 14:53.768
of losing all
he has ever worked for.

14:53.768 --> 14:56.487
Hank has devoted
his entire adult life

14:56.479 --> 14:57.776
to you and your company.

14:57.772 --> 14:59.399
He is your company.

14:59.399 --> 15:02.323
Without him, there is
no Strickland Propane.

15:02.318 --> 15:04.070
Well, there is the one
in Tennessee.

15:05.238 --> 15:06.535
Save it, Junior.

15:06.531 --> 15:08.124
You're punching the heavy bag.

15:08.116 --> 15:09.993
You two put Hank
in this position.

15:09.992 --> 15:11.744
You're gonna fix it.

15:13.287 --> 15:15.415
All right, boy,
we got to fix it.

15:15.415 --> 15:18.760
Yeah. We need some schnapps
to help us think!

15:23.548 --> 15:25.971
Let's get the hell
out of here, boy!

15:34.350 --> 15:38.571
Damn! My breath stinks
like blood and peppermint.

15:41.774 --> 15:44.778
Maybe this is why Mama never
wanted us to get together.

15:44.777 --> 15:48.748
Yeah, and why Hank was
trying to keep us apart.

15:50.533 --> 15:51.785
Oh, hell.

15:51.784 --> 15:54.253
We forgot all about
saving Hank's bacon.

15:54.245 --> 15:56.373
All right, here's
what we gonna do.

15:56.372 --> 15:59.216
We gonna take us a hot
shower and a little nap.

15:59.208 --> 16:02.803
Then we're gonna fix things the
way fellas like us fix things.

16:02.795 --> 16:05.719
And then we ain't ever
gonna see each other again.

16:07.383 --> 16:09.351
Okay, Dad.

16:11.179 --> 16:15.309
You know how to do a first-class
hospitality suite, don't you?

16:15.308 --> 16:17.310
I am your son, ain't I?

16:19.979 --> 16:21.731
Mr. Hill,

16:21.731 --> 16:24.530
your guilt hardly
seems to be at issue.

16:24.525 --> 16:27.495
So we can skip right on
to the punishment phase, which...

16:27.487 --> 16:29.956
I'll give you a preview...
Will be severe.

16:29.947 --> 16:31.324
Yes, sir.

16:31.324 --> 16:33.793
I-I can't tell you
how sorry I am.

16:35.495 --> 16:36.712
Hello?

16:36.871 --> 16:38.248
Buck.

16:38.247 --> 16:39.965
Well, we're kind
of in the middle

16:39.957 --> 16:41.755
of our disciplinary hearing...

16:41.751 --> 16:43.594
Like the one in '84?

16:43.586 --> 16:44.803
Oh, very well, then.

16:44.795 --> 16:46.172
We'll see you shortly.

16:46.172 --> 16:47.799
That was Buck Strickland.

16:47.798 --> 16:51.393
His hospitality suite is open.

16:51.385 --> 16:52.762
Like the one in '84?

16:54.263 --> 16:57.233
Mr. Hill, the Board of Governors
needs to adjourn

16:57.225 --> 16:58.727
to caucus about your case.

16:58.893 --> 17:00.270
You stay put.

17:00.269 --> 17:01.771
I won't move a muscle.

17:01.771 --> 17:04.365
I will await your just decision.

17:13.782 --> 17:16.787
Your husband is a disgrace.

17:16.786 --> 17:18.788
I'm being frozen out.

17:18.788 --> 17:20.210
I get it.

17:20.205 --> 17:22.208
Look, as my way of saying

17:22.208 --> 17:25.257
"I'm sorry for being married
to such a horrible man,"

17:25.252 --> 17:28.097
I would like to treat each
and every one of you

17:28.089 --> 17:29.807
to a spa afternoon.

17:29.799 --> 17:31.767
Manis, pedis, facials.

17:31.759 --> 17:32.760
Hair?

17:32.760 --> 17:33.932
The works.

17:43.062 --> 17:44.279
Done!

17:44.272 --> 17:47.367
We sat in every chair
in the hotel, dude!

17:47.358 --> 17:48.530
Yup.

17:52.405 --> 17:54.749
Pollard, gentlemen,

17:54.740 --> 17:57.960
welcome to the Strickland
Hospitality Suite.

17:57.952 --> 17:59.795
We got us a
scrumptious selection

17:59.787 --> 18:01.960
of desserts in the back room.

18:03.666 --> 18:04.758
Oh, hi!

18:08.337 --> 18:10.465
Yes, my husband made a mistake.

18:10.464 --> 18:13.263
All propane men make
mistakes sometimes.

18:13.259 --> 18:15.978
Including some of your husbands.

18:24.395 --> 18:26.614
I'm in my third term
as president

18:26.606 --> 18:28.734
of the Propane Gas Consortium.

18:28.899 --> 18:31.448
Oh.

18:31.444 --> 18:32.696
Well...

18:32.862 --> 18:35.536
now that everybody's got
a pretty girl in his lap,

18:35.531 --> 18:38.785
I'd like to talk about leniency
for my employee, Hank Hill.

18:38.784 --> 18:40.411
Set up!

18:40.411 --> 18:42.004
Everybody run!

18:41.996 --> 18:43.248
Ray Roy, lock the door.

18:46.709 --> 18:49.679
Now, you're all reasonable men.

18:49.670 --> 18:53.220
Surely you can find forgiveness
in your hearts for old Hank

18:53.215 --> 18:55.764
before your wives get here.

18:55.760 --> 18:57.762
Uh-oh, lost
my bikini top!

19:04.018 --> 19:05.235
Ooh, gotcha!

19:08.230 --> 19:09.527
Ow!

19:15.529 --> 19:16.280
Ooh!

19:16.280 --> 19:17.202
Come down here.

19:18.741 --> 19:20.618
Let me tickle you.

19:23.954 --> 19:26.878
You win, Buck.

19:32.129 --> 19:33.472
Y'ello.

19:33.464 --> 19:35.717
Get their hair done.

19:39.970 --> 19:41.938
Mr. Hill,

19:41.931 --> 19:43.148
we had an opportunity

19:43.140 --> 19:45.438
to talk with your employer,
Buck Strickland.

19:45.434 --> 19:47.027
He convinced us that not only

19:47.019 --> 19:49.772
should your actions
last night be forgiven,

19:49.772 --> 19:52.275
your actions over your
20 years of service

19:52.274 --> 19:54.447
are deserving
of the highest honor.

19:55.778 --> 19:58.201
He was very persuasive.

19:59.573 --> 20:00.790
Accordingly,

20:00.783 --> 20:03.957
the Board of Governors has voted
unanimously to award you

20:03.953 --> 20:06.172
this Hall of Flame jacket.

20:06.163 --> 20:07.756
Does this mean?

20:07.915 --> 20:09.337
I... Wait.

20:09.333 --> 20:11.176
I'm in the Hall of Flame?

20:11.168 --> 20:13.045
All of propane owes you a debt.

20:13.045 --> 20:16.766
Most importantly,
<i>I</i> owe you a debt.

20:16.757 --> 20:18.179
Thanks, OI' Top.

20:20.761 --> 20:22.229
Congratulations, Hank.

20:22.221 --> 20:24.724
Here, let me help
you with your jacket.

20:35.776 --> 20:39.781
Well, Buck, I'll let you say
good-bye to your son.

20:48.789 --> 20:51.668
Well, this is good-bye
forever, right?

20:51.876 --> 20:53.469
Forever, Dad.

21:53.687 --> 21:56.736
<i>My breath stinks like
blood and peppermint.</i>
