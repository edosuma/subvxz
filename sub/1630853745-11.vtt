WEBVTT

00:02.085 --> 00:03.003
Previously, on
"Below Deck Med"...

00:04.295 --> 00:07.090
Frank! I love you!

00:07.132 --> 00:08.466
Ah!

00:08.508 --> 00:09.509
[screaming]

00:11.052 --> 00:14.097
Number five, it's hump day,
downhill from here, Sunshine.

00:14.139 --> 00:16.182
You are way too positive.

00:16.224 --> 00:17.308
[laughing]

00:17.350 --> 00:19.227
Okay.
Charter number five.

00:19.269 --> 00:20.520
-Nice... welcome board.
-Nice to meet you.

00:20.562 --> 00:22.105
Lisa Moore and
her daughter, Shelby,

00:22.147 --> 00:23.732
and some of Shelby's
childhood friends.

00:23.773 --> 00:27.902
* Going in the water,
in the water, in the jet-ski *

00:27.944 --> 00:29.195
These girls are like

00:29.237 --> 00:30.613
the Sisterhood of
the Traveling Pants.

00:30.655 --> 00:32.657
They're the "Gilmour Girls"
on steroids.

00:32.699 --> 00:35.076
Disco was born!

00:41.124 --> 00:42.667
Oh, for God's sake.

00:42.709 --> 00:44.961
My boyfriend's having
issues with me

00:45.003 --> 00:46.671
still continuing
to work with Dave.

00:46.713 --> 00:50.425
But, I don't know what
I'm supposed to do.

00:50.467 --> 00:52.677
-Who was polishing down here?
-Jason was polishing.

00:54.596 --> 00:57.432
Now that I'm a bosun, I
need to learn how to delegate.

00:58.767 --> 01:01.186
But also, if something
goes wrong, it'll be on me.

01:01.227 --> 01:02.979
You're running around too much.

01:03.021 --> 01:05.106
Trust them.
Let them make mistakes.

01:05.148 --> 01:06.399
Sure.

01:06.441 --> 01:07.901
Correct them, don't try
to do their job.

01:07.942 --> 01:11.237
You're my person that I rely on.

01:11.279 --> 01:14.074
I got a floor thing.
I don't wanna see dirty floors.

01:14.115 --> 01:15.575
I vacuumed the bridge,

01:15.617 --> 01:17.744
the captain's cabin,
the main salon...

01:17.786 --> 01:19.412
I don't need your sh--.

01:19.454 --> 01:20.747
I know exactly
I'm doing a good job.

01:20.789 --> 01:23.166
When Tash and Kyle leave
the place like a pigsty,

01:23.208 --> 01:25.418
that just, like,
puts me through the roof.

01:25.460 --> 01:26.419
Ugh!

01:26.461 --> 01:28.338
Have you tried yoga before?

01:28.380 --> 01:29.589
-Yeah.
-Yes!

01:29.631 --> 01:30.590
All of you.

01:30.632 --> 01:31.591
Bye, Court!

01:31.633 --> 01:32.884
Bye!

01:32.926 --> 01:34.219
Oh, boy.

01:41.142 --> 01:44.521
Storm's plan is to use his
own body

01:44.562 --> 01:48.233
on a very sharp, heavy anchor.

01:48.274 --> 01:50.235
If he just gets nicked,
that's not a nick,

01:50.276 --> 01:52.404
that's an arm that's gone.

02:21.558 --> 02:24.144
-You okay?
-Yeah.

02:24.185 --> 02:25.520
-You sure?
-Yeah.

02:25.562 --> 02:26.813
We need to tie a line on.

02:26.855 --> 02:29.566
You can't physically
lift that chain.

02:29.607 --> 02:32.569
-All right.-We got a line ready
for it.

02:39.075 --> 02:40.618
Hey, honey.

02:40.660 --> 02:42.287
Wait, I can't see
anything, I'm in the elevators.

02:42.328 --> 02:43.455
What's the plan for tonight?

02:43.496 --> 02:45.248
I'm playing video games.

02:45.290 --> 02:46.916
But anyway, I just wanna
tell you [kisses]

02:46.958 --> 02:48.251
and thank you so much
for the call.

02:48.293 --> 02:49.627
Oh ----ing hell.

02:49.669 --> 02:50.712
Oh, Kyle.

02:50.754 --> 02:52.213
Oh, Kyle.

02:52.255 --> 02:57.052
If we drop the port, the line
should hold the chain up.

02:57.093 --> 02:58.428
The starboard chain?

02:58.470 --> 03:00.680
Okay, and then we're gonna
use the windlass

03:00.722 --> 03:03.183
to bring the tension off
of the starboard chain,

03:03.224 --> 03:05.560
and the anchor will free itself.

03:08.188 --> 03:10.523
Thank you.

03:23.411 --> 03:25.622
-Thank you!
-Thank you.

03:31.920 --> 03:34.297
Okay, we're gonna use
the windlass

03:34.339 --> 03:36.883
to bring the tension off
of the starboard chain.

03:36.925 --> 03:38.760
Go to that windlass.

03:38.802 --> 03:39.969
Okay.

03:48.019 --> 03:49.521
Okay.

04:03.410 --> 04:05.120
Oh, sh--, yeah, windlass...

04:05.161 --> 04:07.080
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

04:07.122 --> 04:09.374
So, girls, how was the
standup yoga, guys?

04:09.416 --> 04:12.919
-So good.
-It was so fun!

04:20.260 --> 04:21.428
Make sure you got good distance.

04:21.469 --> 04:22.971
-Yeah.
-Okay.

04:29.811 --> 04:30.979
Stop!

04:33.773 --> 04:35.483
Storm.

04:37.193 --> 04:38.403
Ah.

04:51.416 --> 04:52.917
Nice work.

04:55.086 --> 04:58.965
I've seen far worse anchor
tangles, and it's, like...

04:59.007 --> 05:00.633
like a scrunchie,
like a woman's, like...

05:00.675 --> 05:03.553
it's like we're
----ing ----ed.

05:03.595 --> 05:04.804
But yeah, everything
worked out in the end,

05:04.846 --> 05:07.098
so it's all about the journey.

05:07.140 --> 05:09.017
It was stressful, though, bro.

05:09.059 --> 05:11.311
Interior, interior, turning
in about three minutes.

05:11.353 --> 05:13.146
Thank you, Courtney.

05:13.188 --> 05:15.982
Do you think we just get back
into bed and have another nap?

05:16.024 --> 05:19.819
Frank!

05:19.861 --> 05:21.780
Ah!

05:21.821 --> 05:23.823
[laughing]

05:23.865 --> 05:25.492
I'm really frustrated
with Tash and Kyle.

05:25.533 --> 05:27.702
They've both been
completely distracted.

05:27.744 --> 05:29.704
They need to get
their head in the game.

05:29.746 --> 05:32.332
Kyle, what have you done this
morning, fluffed a pillow?

05:32.374 --> 05:33.625
Babe, please don't make me sick,

05:33.667 --> 05:35.168
I'm already feeling
a bit nauseous.

05:35.210 --> 05:36.711
Work hard? You? No.

05:36.753 --> 05:39.089
Natalya really feels
that she's carrying on

05:39.130 --> 05:40.548
the most of the whole team.

05:40.590 --> 05:42.509
Meanwhile, I'm the one
that's helping

05:42.550 --> 05:44.844
in housekeeping and service,

05:44.886 --> 05:46.805
whereas Natasha's
just on service

05:46.846 --> 05:48.515
and Natalya's
just on housekeeping.

05:48.556 --> 05:52.394
Natalya, my sweet dear,
is a huge martyr.

05:52.435 --> 05:54.688
Yeah, well, if
you finish the room

05:54.729 --> 05:56.189
and stop ----ing
bitching and moaning...

05:56.231 --> 06:00.360
I wanna punch you in your penis.

06:00.402 --> 06:02.529
-Throw it.
-Nice and easy, you got it.

06:02.570 --> 06:03.446
Woo!

06:03.488 --> 06:04.906
Ooh, good catch.

06:04.948 --> 06:06.449
Leave... anything you wanna
leave in here, you can,

06:06.491 --> 06:07.742
and I'll bring it out.

06:07.784 --> 06:08.910
Do you wanna get
changed before breakfast?

06:08.952 --> 06:10.745
I'm wanna just
go upstairs.

06:10.787 --> 06:12.455
My thighs are hurting, what
did we do that my thighs hurt?

06:12.497 --> 06:13.540
We did yoga, Mom.

06:13.581 --> 06:14.582
Throw me that line real quick?

06:14.624 --> 06:16.084
No, I can't, because the...

06:16.126 --> 06:18.503
It's... you guys have been
----ing messing up

06:18.545 --> 06:20.547
the bimini for a while.

06:20.588 --> 06:22.007
What are you mumbling?

06:22.048 --> 06:23.591
It's already been on the
wrong side of the bimini

06:23.633 --> 06:25.552
since you guys brought it
in the first time.

06:27.971 --> 06:30.056
Just seems like
we're working really hard

06:30.098 --> 06:31.391
but not really smart.

06:31.433 --> 06:33.059
It's the geometry of,
like, okay,

06:33.101 --> 06:35.186
if there's two lines going
forward and no line going back,

06:35.228 --> 06:36.980
well, the boat's only
gonna go forward.

06:37.022 --> 06:40.066
But at this point, I think
I'd rather try

06:40.108 --> 06:42.652
to figure out the
Dewey Decimal system...

06:46.239 --> 06:49.617
When was the last time you heard
of a Dewey Decimal joke?

06:49.659 --> 06:51.536
Do you wanna fix this,

06:51.578 --> 06:53.079
so we don't break
the bimini on this thing?

06:53.121 --> 06:54.456
Yeah.

07:00.211 --> 07:02.088
Hello!

07:02.130 --> 07:03.506
How was it?

07:03.548 --> 07:05.175
-Great!
-So good!

07:07.552 --> 07:08.970
For the chef's special today,

07:09.012 --> 07:12.057
we have beetroot-cured
salmon with sous vide egg

07:12.098 --> 07:13.433
on whole wheat toast.

07:13.475 --> 07:14.893
-That sounds really good.
-Yeah.

07:14.934 --> 07:16.686
When in Malta, eat your salmon.

07:16.728 --> 07:18.521
Mm, babe, thank you.

07:18.563 --> 07:20.273
Can you not?

07:20.315 --> 07:21.608
We're at breakfast.

07:21.649 --> 07:23.109
That looks like what
my mom yells at me for,

07:23.151 --> 07:24.986
and you're yelling at
your mother for that.

07:25.028 --> 07:26.946
She's right, though, I gotta
give her when she's right.

07:26.988 --> 07:30.533
I think that people who
weren't born with technology

07:30.575 --> 07:32.243
in their lives are more
addicted to technology.

07:32.285 --> 07:35.413
-You photograph your food.
-I do, every meal.

07:35.455 --> 07:36.456
-You photograph McDonald's.
-Mwah!

07:36.498 --> 07:37.957
She photographs everything.

07:37.999 --> 07:39.959
-It's for the memories.
-It's for the mems.

07:40.001 --> 07:41.086
Is this primary?

07:41.127 --> 07:42.462
-Yeah, primary.
-I'll take primary.

07:42.504 --> 07:44.005
Yeah.

07:44.047 --> 07:46.341
You might be able to run up
the food to the bar there.

07:46.383 --> 07:47.926
Anything for you, Tash.

07:47.967 --> 07:48.968
Aw.

07:49.010 --> 07:50.637
Whoa!

07:50.679 --> 07:52.138
Thank you.

07:52.180 --> 07:54.182
Is the chef plating all
of these as well?

07:54.224 --> 07:55.809
-Yes.
-Wow.

07:55.850 --> 07:57.394
He does everything,

07:57.435 --> 08:01.648
we just serve with a smile
and take the gratitude, yeah.

08:01.690 --> 08:03.733
This salmon's incredible, mm.

08:05.276 --> 08:08.029
Jay, I'm gonna put
this here for you.

08:12.200 --> 08:13.410
Copy.

08:13.451 --> 08:15.912
-That was delicious.
-Oh, my God.

08:15.954 --> 08:18.498
-Yes, amazing.
-It was amazing.

08:18.540 --> 08:20.166
-Should we go do water?
-Yeah.

08:25.171 --> 08:26.131
Let's hit it, ladies.

08:26.172 --> 08:28.258
Thank you, Chef,
wherever you are.

08:28.299 --> 08:30.385
I hope he's sleeping, God.

08:30.427 --> 08:33.513
* Start spreading the... *

08:33.555 --> 08:34.514
Just the two people
we're looking for.

08:34.556 --> 08:35.890
What's up?

08:35.932 --> 08:37.517
We wanted to find out
what time you might

08:37.559 --> 08:39.102
like beach picnic today.

08:39.144 --> 08:41.855
What was Chef thinking,
about, like, preparing?

08:41.896 --> 08:43.815
I think he wanted to make,
like, sushi rolls on the beach.

08:43.857 --> 08:45.191
Oh, God, that's good.

08:45.233 --> 08:46.693
We have to bang out
this last day proper.

08:46.735 --> 08:48.361
-Like, let's get the...
-Oh, my God...

08:48.403 --> 08:51.072
-Don't "last day" me.
-Yeah, you know what I mean.

08:53.450 --> 08:56.453
[bleep] sake, mate.

08:56.494 --> 08:59.080
Pick your sh-- up.

09:03.001 --> 09:04.753
-What up, Z-dawg?
-Hey, Courts.

09:06.129 --> 09:07.297
What happened?

09:07.339 --> 09:08.673
The chains got...

09:10.592 --> 09:12.177
Yeah.

09:13.178 --> 09:14.721
Really? Ooh.

09:14.763 --> 09:18.308
Dude, if I ask for it to be put
away, I need it to be put away.

09:18.350 --> 09:19.726
Everything's all over the floor.

09:19.768 --> 09:21.144
Like, you understand
why I'm frustrated?

09:21.186 --> 09:23.063
So, where do you want
me to put it?

09:23.104 --> 09:24.230
There's no slots,
where do you want to put it?

09:24.272 --> 09:25.732
So, there is slots.

09:25.774 --> 09:26.983
It's either in the laz,
it's on the sundeck,

09:27.025 --> 09:28.068
or it's in the bosun's locker.

09:28.109 --> 09:29.235
I will...
I can do that.

09:29.277 --> 09:30.904
-Okay.
-I will...

09:30.945 --> 09:32.489
If it's the fifth charter and
you haven't been asked.

09:32.530 --> 09:34.741
I'll ask you specifically now,
I'll write a list.

09:34.783 --> 09:35.909
Yeah, if you ask me, I'll do it.

09:35.950 --> 09:37.410
-All right.
-Well, you gotta ask me,

09:37.452 --> 09:38.787
not someone that doesn't--

09:38.828 --> 09:40.288
No, no, no,
there's not someone else.

09:40.330 --> 09:42.665
I'm asking you...
I asked you to do the buckets...

09:42.707 --> 09:44.292
Now you're asking me, and I will
be more than happy to do it.

09:44.334 --> 09:45.960
-You're a skipper, aren't you?
-Yeah.

09:46.002 --> 09:47.337
If you asked me
to put something away...

09:47.379 --> 09:49.381
-Tell me when to do it.
-And I put this away.

09:49.422 --> 09:50.507
That's how it works.

09:50.548 --> 09:51.841
This is not how you do things.

09:51.883 --> 09:53.134
That's how we got
on the boat, man.

09:53.176 --> 09:55.220
I think Jason enjoys
upsetting people.

09:55.261 --> 09:57.597
Right now I'm doing more
than I want to do

09:57.639 --> 09:59.224
because of his
attitude towards me.

09:59.265 --> 10:03.269
I just wanna be like, oh, you...
you know, do your ----ing job.

10:07.774 --> 10:10.652
Coming up...

10:10.694 --> 10:12.320
Don't be worried.

10:12.362 --> 10:13.530
I wake up, there's not one
thing pulled for breakfast,

10:13.571 --> 10:14.823
the pantry's a mess,

10:14.864 --> 10:16.199
all the décor from
the night is still out.

10:16.241 --> 10:17.283
That's not okay.

10:17.325 --> 10:19.244
Natasha, can I see you
on the bridge?

10:27.419 --> 10:28.336
I think I'm gonna go
on a jet-ski.

10:29.170 --> 10:30.463
Yeah.

10:30.505 --> 10:32.465
Okay, it is life jackets
at all times in the water.

10:32.507 --> 10:33.925
Ooh!

10:35.301 --> 10:39.389
Yes!

10:39.431 --> 10:40.849
Ah!

10:40.890 --> 10:41.850
Yeah.

10:41.891 --> 10:44.102
[whistling, cheering]

10:51.067 --> 10:52.193
Just to sweeten that up.

10:52.235 --> 10:53.403
You could squeeze
in here, move...

10:53.445 --> 10:54.571
I'll move over.

10:54.612 --> 10:56.406
-Cute bikini.
-Do I look good?

10:56.448 --> 10:58.074
Thank you, I think
it's on wrong.

10:58.116 --> 10:59.784
I think it looks nice.

11:04.372 --> 11:06.124
Hi.

11:06.166 --> 11:07.417
Aw!

11:07.459 --> 11:09.711
All right, I have
an elderflower-vodka-based

11:09.753 --> 11:13.089
-fruit mint...
-Wow.

11:13.131 --> 11:13.923
Whoa!

11:13.965 --> 11:15.175
Um, Pimm's.

11:19.888 --> 11:21.389
This is disgusting.

11:21.431 --> 11:23.224
Unbelievable.

11:23.266 --> 11:25.060
We gotta manage this chaos.

11:25.101 --> 11:27.020
-Thank you very much.
-You're welcome.

11:27.062 --> 11:28.646
I'll be up with
the tequila one shortly.

11:28.688 --> 11:34.361
Natasha, Natasha, can we get
the stew pantry clean, please?

11:34.402 --> 11:35.820
Okay, copy.

11:35.862 --> 11:37.489
Whoa, that is so good.

11:37.530 --> 11:38.823
Yeah.

11:38.865 --> 11:40.950
Wait, elderflower,
or did I make that up?

11:44.329 --> 11:45.497
Natalya.

11:51.378 --> 11:53.213
-4:30, we're leaving.
-4:30, okay, that's fine.

11:53.254 --> 11:54.756
Okay.

11:54.798 --> 11:56.466
So, my plan of attack today
is I'm gonna go with Courtney

11:56.508 --> 11:58.468
-and Mzi just to help them.
-Okay.

11:58.510 --> 11:59.886
Dave's gonna be with them,

11:59.928 --> 12:01.012
because Dave's cooking
on the beach.

12:01.054 --> 12:02.972
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

12:03.014 --> 12:05.392
Yeah, but we have
a little more wind tonight.

12:09.270 --> 12:12.273
I've been thinking about
when Captain Sandy said to me

12:12.315 --> 12:15.318
that I need to delegate more
responsibilities to my team.

12:15.360 --> 12:17.153
-You're running around too much.
-Mm-hmm.

12:17.195 --> 12:19.197
Trust them, don't try
to do their job.

12:19.239 --> 12:20.365
-You know what I mean?
-Yeah, yeah.

12:20.407 --> 12:23.785
My plan is to name
a lead deckhand.

12:23.827 --> 12:25.328
They didn't really do wine
or Prosecco yesterday,

12:25.370 --> 12:27.372
so I'm just gonna put one
bottle of each,

12:27.414 --> 12:28.957
and then the beers that
they were drinking, waters,

12:28.998 --> 12:30.417
and kombucha in here,

12:30.458 --> 12:32.127
because they're big water
and kombucha fans.

12:32.168 --> 12:34.504
With Mzi and Courtney
I've got a great team,

12:34.546 --> 12:36.923
so choosing a lead deckhand
is gonna be really tough.

12:36.965 --> 12:38.508
But what makes it
really ----ing easy

12:38.550 --> 12:40.510
is that I'll definitely
not choose Jason.

12:44.014 --> 12:45.932
What's it?

12:48.268 --> 12:50.103
-I can do it.
-Yeah?

12:50.145 --> 12:51.229
Storm, will you
hand me stuff, please?

12:51.271 --> 12:52.689
Will I hand you stuff?

12:52.731 --> 12:54.524
Come on, Mzi, it's not
your birthday yet.

12:54.566 --> 12:57.235
I mean, I did set the bar high
last year with the lap dance.

12:57.277 --> 12:59.446
Get your birthday dance, Mzi!

12:59.487 --> 13:01.698
-Yo, get his birthday cake.
-Yeah, yeah!

13:01.740 --> 13:04.117
Oh, my God.

13:04.159 --> 13:06.786
Did you get a boner, Mzi?

13:06.828 --> 13:08.204
I reckon he did.

13:08.246 --> 13:09.414
Tash, they're gonna
be ready for you now.

13:09.456 --> 13:11.207
Do you wanna run
these to the guests?

13:11.249 --> 13:12.917
-Yeah.
-Thank you.

13:15.712 --> 13:17.630
No!

13:17.672 --> 13:18.757
Dave-O.

13:18.798 --> 13:20.967
-You look cute, bruv.
-Oh!

13:21.009 --> 13:22.510
Ooh.

13:24.804 --> 13:26.514
Just hit me up on your way back.

13:26.556 --> 13:28.475
Yeah, I'm not gonna be long,
I'm just dropping them off.

13:28.516 --> 13:29.809
All right.

13:29.851 --> 13:32.812
Hey, Mom, how do you feel
about green eye shadow?

13:32.854 --> 13:35.106
Ready?

13:35.148 --> 13:37.776
Come look at it.

13:37.817 --> 13:40.070
That's so rude, you're the
rudest person I've ever met.

13:40.111 --> 13:41.738
-These are the plates, yeah?
-Yeah.

13:41.780 --> 13:43.198
Okay.

13:43.239 --> 13:44.783
Does someone wanna help me
put the cutlery out?

13:44.824 --> 13:47.410
Yeah, I'll help you.

13:47.452 --> 13:49.245
I'm really enjoying
this charter.

13:49.287 --> 13:50.914
Tash seems to be responding,

13:50.955 --> 13:53.458
I'm having fun, there's a
good vibe, which is nice.

13:53.500 --> 13:56.670
Friend zone, hugs,
it's only a good thing.

13:56.711 --> 13:58.630
So, I'm not gonna put
any pressure on anything.

13:58.672 --> 14:02.133
I'm just... let's just keep it
here and see where it goes.

14:02.175 --> 14:04.177
Do you wanna learn
something new about me?

14:04.219 --> 14:05.345
What, something I don't know?

14:05.387 --> 14:07.764
Yeah... I can squeak
my eyeballs.

14:07.806 --> 14:09.641
-Really?
-Okay.

14:09.683 --> 14:10.642
[squeaking]

14:10.684 --> 14:11.851
Ooh!

14:11.893 --> 14:13.186
That did not sound
healthy at all.

14:13.228 --> 14:14.229
Everyone was, like...

14:14.270 --> 14:15.814
Who's ready to go, nerds?

14:15.855 --> 14:18.233
I'm gonna go continue
preparations for tonight,

14:18.274 --> 14:19.901
but enjoy the beach.

14:19.943 --> 14:21.111
-Woo!
-Thank you so much.

14:21.152 --> 14:22.320
See you soon.

14:22.362 --> 14:24.114
-All right, ladies.
-Are you coming?

14:24.155 --> 14:25.407
No, I'm not coming,
I've gotta pull all this in.

14:25.448 --> 14:26.616
Thank you so much, seriously.

14:26.658 --> 14:27.992
Enjoy your trek ashore.

14:28.034 --> 14:29.828
Oh, my gosh, I'm so excited,
thank you.

14:29.869 --> 14:31.913
-Enjoy!
-Bye-bye!

14:31.955 --> 14:34.457
-Who rules the world?
-Girls!

14:34.499 --> 14:39.838
Woo!

14:39.879 --> 14:41.715
That's girl power right there.

14:47.387 --> 14:48.722
Woo!

14:48.763 --> 14:51.391
It's so beautiful!

14:51.433 --> 14:52.684
Welcome!

14:52.726 --> 14:54.602
Here you go.

14:54.644 --> 14:57.856
You guys, you have
outdone yourselves.

14:57.897 --> 14:59.190
Oh, my God!

14:59.232 --> 15:00.692
-Am I taking you back?
-Yeah.

15:00.734 --> 15:02.944
-Thank you for making this.
-It looks beautiful.

15:02.986 --> 15:04.446
-You are amazing.
-Oh, my God.

15:04.487 --> 15:06.656
Motor Yacht Home,
Motor Yacht Home, Courtney.

15:06.698 --> 15:08.825
Just letting you know that's
all guests dropped off,

15:08.867 --> 15:11.327
and I'm just returning now to
drop Mzi back off at the boat.

15:11.369 --> 15:14.581
Thank you very much for that
report, we'll be standing by.

15:18.668 --> 15:21.254
So, what I've done here is
I googled Dolly Parton.

15:30.388 --> 15:31.723
-So, we're doing...
-You are outstanding.

15:31.765 --> 15:33.516
Thank you.

15:33.558 --> 15:35.935
The dinner-theme party Guy's
and Dolly's is super confusing.

15:35.977 --> 15:39.689
After dinner, the ladies want
the Guy's and Dolly's party,

15:39.731 --> 15:41.941
dressing up as Guy Fieri
and Dolly Parton,

15:41.983 --> 15:43.318
their favorite celebrities.

15:43.360 --> 15:45.028
I have no idea when
Dolly Parton was big.

15:45.070 --> 15:48.031
Like, I don't do well with,
like, going back in time.

15:48.073 --> 15:50.116
-Hello, Captain.
-Beautiful.

15:50.158 --> 15:53.745
-Do you like it?
-Very pink.

15:53.787 --> 15:54.871
Cool.

15:54.913 --> 15:56.915
Okay, okay, interesting facts.

15:56.956 --> 15:58.458
Go... Alex, you go first.

15:58.500 --> 15:59.876
Oh, it's just that
I'm a quarter Japanese.

15:59.918 --> 16:01.628
-That's a fun fact.
-That is a fun fact.

16:01.670 --> 16:03.838
That is a fun fact,
and applicable.

16:03.880 --> 16:05.298
[laughing]

16:05.340 --> 16:06.549
I'm just gonna bow you in.

16:06.591 --> 16:08.635
Okay.

16:08.677 --> 16:11.054
Thank you.

16:11.096 --> 16:12.430
I'm definitely getting, like,

16:12.472 --> 16:13.973
more confident in my
tender-driving skills.

16:14.015 --> 16:16.643
I was obviously really nervous
coming into this season.

16:16.685 --> 16:18.770
Courts, remember,
when the bow's up,

16:18.812 --> 16:21.147
put it in reverse and
turn it the other way round.

16:21.189 --> 16:22.691
-You got it.
-Yeah.

16:22.732 --> 16:25.527
That's Mzi back on board,
and tender away again.

16:25.568 --> 16:27.779
I do kinda feel like
a Bond girl, like,

16:27.821 --> 16:30.198
whilst I'm driving this tender,
especially if I do it well.

16:30.240 --> 16:32.659
Like a boss bitch,
like, just rocking out.

16:36.788 --> 16:37.747
[gasps]

16:37.789 --> 16:39.082
What's coming?

16:39.124 --> 16:40.417
I'm just gonna make
a sorbet for you.

16:40.458 --> 16:41.876
I've got some yuzu.

16:41.918 --> 16:43.712
Oh, my God, yum!

16:43.753 --> 16:45.588
And then I've got a load
of vanilla and some maple.

16:45.630 --> 16:47.465
-Oh, my God.
-And a bit of coconut milk.

16:47.507 --> 16:49.175
You are an
exceptional human being.

16:49.217 --> 16:50.844
Wow.

16:50.885 --> 16:52.846
Okay.
[bleep]

16:52.887 --> 16:54.222
Do you like it?

16:54.264 --> 16:56.474
It looks wonderful,
you ----ing killed it.

16:56.516 --> 16:58.184
So, I need to dress
Mzi up in that wig.

16:58.226 --> 16:59.436
Yes?

16:59.477 --> 17:00.979
So, you're fully
dressing up, mate.

17:01.021 --> 17:02.439
Huh?

17:02.480 --> 17:04.149
She's got your outfit
for you and everything.

17:05.859 --> 17:07.277
I'll wear one with you.

17:07.318 --> 17:08.611
The things we do for tips.

17:08.653 --> 17:10.989
Would you like to try
the yuzu sorbet?

17:11.031 --> 17:15.035
-Ooh!
-Oh, my God, yes!

17:15.076 --> 17:17.287
See, Mzi, I brought your outfit.

17:17.328 --> 17:19.122
Let's get you Dolled up, sis.

17:19.164 --> 17:20.623
No, I got you a skirt.

17:20.665 --> 17:22.959
Do you wanna do, like, a
fun one, with your arms up?

17:23.001 --> 17:24.878
Yes. Woo!

17:24.919 --> 17:27.464
Okay, I'm four bras deep,
I'm four bras deep.

17:27.505 --> 17:29.174
This is so outrageous.

17:29.215 --> 17:31.634
This is a bit...

17:31.676 --> 17:34.137
wait, lipstick,
we need lipstick.

17:34.179 --> 17:35.305
Oh, my God.

17:35.347 --> 17:37.223
Oh, look, put these pants on.

17:37.265 --> 17:39.392
Oh, wow!

17:39.434 --> 17:41.644
Very, very honored to be Dolly,

17:41.686 --> 17:44.731
except I don't
work 9:00 to 5:00.

17:44.773 --> 17:46.524
This is hot, though.

17:47.525 --> 17:48.610
I know.

17:48.651 --> 17:50.153
Okay, I'll come back
for you guys.

17:50.195 --> 17:51.654
Yeah, cheers, mate.

17:51.696 --> 17:52.530
Okay, ladies.

17:52.572 --> 17:53.782
Are you ready for us to board?

17:53.823 --> 17:55.617
-Yep, ready for you to board.
-Okay.

17:55.658 --> 17:57.952
-I see incoming...
-Incoming!

17:57.994 --> 17:59.287
Courtney.

17:59.329 --> 18:00.288
Yes, thanks, Cap,
I'm on the stern,

18:00.330 --> 18:01.289
ready for her.

18:01.331 --> 18:02.791
Okay, Mzi-Mzi, let's go.

18:04.417 --> 18:06.086
I see décor.

18:06.127 --> 18:08.129
Oh, is that décor?

18:08.171 --> 18:09.297
-Oh!
-Ah!

18:09.339 --> 18:10.757
Hey, you've got the stern, yeah?

18:10.799 --> 18:12.342
Courtney's like a
little captain out there.

18:12.384 --> 18:16.179
I know, killing it.

18:16.221 --> 18:18.390
-Oh, my God!
-Ah!

18:18.431 --> 18:20.016
-Oh, yeah.
-Oh, my God.

18:20.058 --> 18:21.685
Oh, she is...

18:21.726 --> 18:24.145
Oh my God.

18:24.187 --> 18:26.398
[chattering]

18:28.900 --> 18:31.861
[shouting, laughing]

18:31.903 --> 18:33.321
Oh!

18:34.155 --> 18:35.990
-Mzi, holy sh--.
-Mzi!

18:36.032 --> 18:38.159
-It's Dolly.
-It's Dolly.

18:38.201 --> 18:39.494
I don't know who you are.

18:39.536 --> 18:41.246
But right now,
I really love who you are.

18:42.080 --> 18:43.498
Oh, my God.

18:43.540 --> 18:44.916
Just take your time.

18:47.252 --> 18:48.420
How was it?

18:48.461 --> 18:49.504
Yeah, really cool,
they loved it.

18:49.546 --> 18:50.797
-They did, eh?
-Yeah.

18:50.839 --> 18:52.007
Thanks goodness it's
so calm, though.

18:52.048 --> 18:53.341
Yeah, I know, it was super calm.

18:53.383 --> 18:54.634
So you can really just,
like, ease yourself in.

18:54.676 --> 18:55.885
So, I literally just
eased my way in...

18:55.927 --> 18:57.637
And it just sat there,
and I was like,

18:57.679 --> 18:58.680
oh, my God, praise the Lord.
How have I just done this?

18:58.722 --> 19:00.557
Court is a fantastic deckhand.

19:00.598 --> 19:02.934
She's ----ing killing it.

19:02.976 --> 19:04.811
I gave her two lessons
in the tender

19:04.853 --> 19:06.354
and she drives it better
than I do.

19:06.396 --> 19:07.772
She's aware that certain
things need to be done,

19:07.814 --> 19:10.608
and then she does them
before being asked.

19:10.650 --> 19:13.445
I've got eyes on
Courtney to be my lead.

19:13.486 --> 19:15.780
Problem is,
Mzi's a personal friend of mine,

19:15.822 --> 19:18.408
and he's gonna be so
----ing bummed.

19:18.450 --> 19:21.745
He's gonna be so, so,
so super-bummed.

19:25.790 --> 19:27.083
Coming up...

19:27.125 --> 19:29.586
Captain says that pantry's
absolutely a vom show,

19:29.627 --> 19:31.713
and the only person she sees
ever cleaning it is you.

19:31.755 --> 19:33.715
Like, I wanted to say, Cap,

19:33.757 --> 19:34.883
you don't understand how many
times I'm busting my ass

19:34.924 --> 19:36.551
in housekeeping assisting
Natalya.

19:49.773 --> 19:50.190
All right, mate?

19:51.066 --> 19:52.108
Hello, there.

19:52.150 --> 19:53.860
-Got it?
-Yeah.

19:53.902 --> 19:55.779
All right, let's get outta here.

19:55.820 --> 19:58.281
Bloody hell, quite a jump there.

19:58.323 --> 19:59.491
-I'm a springbok.
-Yeah.

19:59.532 --> 20:00.867
South African, baby.

20:00.909 --> 20:02.660
Is everything Dolly tonight?

20:02.702 --> 20:05.538
We... the girls getting ready
are Dolly, we're Guy.

20:07.749 --> 20:08.875
Do you want me
to pass this one up, Storm?

20:08.917 --> 20:10.877
That's okay, I'm gonna jump on.

20:12.587 --> 20:14.047
Oh, my God, Nat.

20:14.089 --> 20:15.382
Did Mzi change?

20:15.423 --> 20:17.092
-Mzi's back to normal.
-Oh [bleep].

20:18.635 --> 20:20.428
Yeah, you looked fine.

20:22.097 --> 20:23.056
-Hey?
-Sorry?

20:23.098 --> 20:24.891
-Just joking.
-Thanks.

20:24.933 --> 20:26.101
Never.

20:26.142 --> 20:27.435
How's your make your
boobs look like that?

20:27.477 --> 20:28.853
-I've got four bras on.
-Ah!

20:28.895 --> 20:30.230
It's really sore,
I'm not gonna lie.

20:30.271 --> 20:31.856
I'm gonna go set up the sundeck.

20:31.898 --> 20:33.608
Mzi, stop.

20:37.070 --> 20:38.071
Disgusting.

20:38.113 --> 20:39.114
I'm happy with my boobs.

20:39.155 --> 20:40.657
Like, I developed late.

20:40.699 --> 20:42.283
Girls in my primary school
got them, and then, like,

20:42.325 --> 20:45.453
they used to call me "Flatty
Natty" for, like, 20 minutes.

20:45.495 --> 20:49.082
Then all of a sudden
I was, like, bam... ha!

20:49.124 --> 20:52.627
You know, if I had 100 euros
every time I said that...

20:52.669 --> 20:53.628
Can I put your
Bump-It in for you?

20:53.670 --> 20:54.713
Yeah, would you help me?

20:54.754 --> 20:56.840
I'll help you with your Bump-It.

21:01.177 --> 21:03.054
That's amazing.

21:13.648 --> 21:15.275
This is not good.

21:15.316 --> 21:18.445
-Oh my God.
-Oh my God!

21:18.486 --> 21:19.946
This is beautiful!

21:19.988 --> 21:22.532
[screaming]

21:22.574 --> 21:24.367
How stunning!

21:24.409 --> 21:26.661
Oh, my gosh.

21:26.703 --> 21:28.121
That's so good.

21:28.163 --> 21:30.498
Shelby, did you throw us a
birthday party in Malta?

21:30.540 --> 21:32.709
I threw you
a birthday party in Malta.

21:32.751 --> 21:34.044
I don't know why everybody's

21:34.085 --> 21:36.671
looking like a
trashy Dolly today.

21:41.426 --> 21:43.011
Oh, my God.

21:43.053 --> 21:46.556
I'm got to do all the cabins
now, plus all the laundry.

21:46.598 --> 21:47.807
I need a Guy behind me.

21:47.849 --> 21:50.101
-You ready?
-I've got you!

21:54.314 --> 21:55.899
Bitch, I do everything.

21:55.940 --> 21:58.777
All they have to do is walk
into service and put out plates.

21:58.818 --> 22:00.320
Should I come out like this?

22:00.362 --> 22:01.988
You have yolk titties.

22:07.619 --> 22:09.162
-Kyle?
-Oof, yeah?

22:09.204 --> 22:11.790
Will you make me
the happiest Dolly alive?

22:21.341 --> 22:24.052
Oh, my God, look at you!

22:29.974 --> 22:32.894
These are called Big Bosom
Berries.

22:32.936 --> 22:35.605
So, take a shot and then chase
it with a pink one, yeah.

22:35.647 --> 22:36.815
Oh, my gosh.

22:36.856 --> 22:38.733
-Oh, whoa!
-Oh sh--.

22:38.775 --> 22:40.902
I spilled Flavortown!

22:42.737 --> 22:44.698
Well, it wasn't done well,

22:44.739 --> 22:47.325
because I just got a
ton of sh-- off of it.

22:50.328 --> 22:52.205
Eyelashes on the floor.

22:52.247 --> 22:55.208
I'm running down, Courtney,
when you're ready.

22:55.250 --> 22:56.626
Hey.

22:58.336 --> 23:01.715
-He... he ignores me.
-Yeah, I know.

23:04.592 --> 23:06.011
Yeah, but I'm sorry
about that.

23:06.052 --> 23:07.554
If it's a problem,
just come to me.

23:07.595 --> 23:11.474
Like, if it's disrespectful,
all right?

23:11.516 --> 23:13.309
I definitely enjoy
the older generation women,

23:13.351 --> 23:17.063
because these guys and
their giggling...

23:17.105 --> 23:19.607
they're honestly
driving me up the wall.

23:19.649 --> 23:21.026
I think today is
just not your day.

23:21.067 --> 23:21.943
Not at all.

23:21.985 --> 23:24.612
Well, this trip is not my day.

23:28.533 --> 23:30.910
Dave, have you got the knife
to serve it with,

23:30.952 --> 23:32.746
because I can carry up, if not.

23:32.787 --> 23:34.914
I've got knives, yeah.

23:34.956 --> 23:37.751
There's not anything else
you want me to do?

23:37.792 --> 23:38.752
Have a good sleep,
I'll see you tomorrow.

23:38.793 --> 23:40.253
Thanks, brü.

23:40.295 --> 23:41.588
Thank you so much for today,
you're a rock star.

23:41.629 --> 23:43.423
Thanks, Stormy.

23:43.465 --> 23:46.217
-Okay, I'm going up.
-All right, thank you.

23:46.259 --> 23:47.844
[vocalizing]

23:51.473 --> 23:52.849
Gonna do this sh-- now.

23:52.891 --> 23:54.267
What's up, sweet cheeks?

23:54.309 --> 23:55.393
Hey, hon.

23:55.435 --> 23:56.603
I was talking to your ass,
not to you.

23:56.644 --> 23:58.688
Oh, love you too.

23:58.730 --> 24:00.398
So, that's their birthday cake?

24:00.440 --> 24:01.775
Fancy.

24:01.816 --> 24:02.776
Whose birthday?

24:02.817 --> 24:05.278
Aurora and Monique...

24:05.320 --> 24:07.405
-Monique.
-Her birthday's today?

24:07.447 --> 24:08.448
Are you gonna strip for them?

24:08.490 --> 24:10.742
No.

24:10.784 --> 24:13.411
-What is that?
-I'm a diner.

24:13.453 --> 24:14.996
What are you?

24:15.038 --> 24:16.498
I'm Guy Fieri,
and we're rolling out,

24:16.539 --> 24:20.126
giving you the greatest diners
and drive-ins and dives.

24:20.168 --> 24:23.630
Natalya, Natalya,
do you wanna come sing?

24:23.672 --> 24:24.881
Coming.

24:27.175 --> 24:28.385
That's my hair.

24:28.426 --> 24:31.805
Gives it a floating head vibe.

24:31.846 --> 24:36.101
* Happy birthday to you *

24:36.142 --> 24:37.352
Oh, my God!

24:37.394 --> 24:43.149
* Happy birthday,
dear Monique and Aurora *

24:43.191 --> 24:48.363
* Happy birthday to you *

24:48.405 --> 24:51.950
Woo!

24:51.991 --> 24:53.910
Dolly's slippery nipples.

24:53.952 --> 24:55.620
-Ooh!
-Oh!

24:55.662 --> 24:57.247
Oh, wow.

24:57.288 --> 24:58.331
I get it.

24:58.373 --> 25:00.166
Happy birthday!

25:00.208 --> 25:02.502
You guys, thank you so much
for coming out, oh, my God.

25:02.544 --> 25:04.004
This is the best birthday ever.

25:04.045 --> 25:06.381
I need a picture of this first,
because this is scary.

25:07.382 --> 25:09.801
"Because this is scary."

25:09.843 --> 25:11.302
Well, thank you for
making our birthday.

25:11.344 --> 25:12.679
-Oh!
-Aw!

25:12.721 --> 25:14.347
Thank you!

25:14.389 --> 25:15.807
Cheers.

25:15.849 --> 25:17.726
-What's going on with...
-Everything's cool.

25:17.767 --> 25:19.269
...that one.

25:19.310 --> 25:20.645
I'm gonna have a conversation
with him tomorrow.

25:20.687 --> 25:21.896
About what?

25:21.938 --> 25:22.939
He was rude to
Courtney just before,

25:22.981 --> 25:24.107
obviously some sort of reason.

25:24.149 --> 25:25.900
Why was he rude to her for?

25:25.942 --> 25:27.485
He just ignores her.

25:27.527 --> 25:29.154
You need to respect
your crewmembers,

25:29.195 --> 25:30.947
and especially if you're
on the same team.

25:30.989 --> 25:32.657
It's affecting your team now,
not just you, like...

25:32.699 --> 25:34.325
Yeah, that's why I'm having
a conversation with him

25:34.367 --> 25:37.037
and tell him this is not
the way that you treat Courtney

25:37.078 --> 25:39.998
and the way that you treat me,
and it's sh--.

25:41.416 --> 25:43.126
Yeah, she's really good.

25:51.051 --> 25:53.094
It's not for him to decide,
you're his boss.

25:54.262 --> 25:56.097
I also feel bad.

26:00.185 --> 26:01.186
Sorry!

26:03.772 --> 26:05.065
Coming up...

26:05.106 --> 26:07.192
That stain has been
there for two days.

26:07.233 --> 26:10.070
I'm witnessing Natasha
slipping in some areas.

26:17.410 --> 26:18.328
We said we were
gonna be up at 6:45.

26:20.205 --> 26:22.916
Yeah.
Sunrise is at 6:52.

26:25.210 --> 26:27.420
All right, right, toodles.

26:27.462 --> 26:29.381
All right, thank you,
I'll see you in the morning.

26:29.422 --> 26:30.882
Good night.

26:35.553 --> 26:37.555
My stomach, it's so...

26:39.182 --> 26:41.518
Oh, you're ----ing warm.

26:46.731 --> 26:49.609
Oh, my God.

26:49.651 --> 26:51.236
Oh!

26:51.277 --> 26:57.283
So, we have cranberry-pineapple,
a vodka base, lime, and berry.

26:57.325 --> 27:00.203
Oh, it looks like
there's one left over.

27:00.245 --> 27:02.414
For you!

27:05.458 --> 27:06.668
[bleep] me.

27:09.170 --> 27:12.424
-Mm.
-Good?

27:12.465 --> 27:14.092
You smashed it.

27:14.134 --> 27:15.385
I feel like this is our
hangout spot now.

27:15.427 --> 27:17.178
They're gonna be up very late.

27:17.220 --> 27:20.056
Work as a team as much as
we can, help each other out.

27:20.098 --> 27:22.392
I'll be watching them.

27:22.434 --> 27:24.728
One, two, three,
four, five, six...

27:24.769 --> 27:26.730
[shouting]

27:26.771 --> 27:27.731
Table, table.

27:27.772 --> 27:30.191
I'm off the boat.

27:30.233 --> 27:31.568
I'm just distracted.

27:31.609 --> 27:34.195
-With Frank.
-Yeah.

27:36.114 --> 27:38.283
You know, I never, ever
feel anxious in love.

27:38.324 --> 27:40.243
Do you think you're
overthinking it now,

27:40.285 --> 27:42.412
though because...

27:42.454 --> 27:45.040
So, how do you think you can
change it this time round?

27:45.081 --> 27:47.292
That's what I'm trying
to figure out, Tash.

27:52.088 --> 27:55.258
But I really wanna say thank
you so much for your patience

27:55.300 --> 27:57.052
and never climbing down
my throat and saying

27:57.093 --> 27:59.220
"Get the [bleep] over yourself,
you're at work."

27:59.262 --> 28:02.432
It just shows you again
what a leader you are.

28:02.474 --> 28:03.683
It really does.

28:03.725 --> 28:05.810
I'll send my bank details
over for deposits.

28:05.852 --> 28:07.437
Yeah?

28:07.479 --> 28:10.648
Because I just blew smoke right
up your asshole for free.

28:10.690 --> 28:12.650
I don't know
where everybody went.

28:12.692 --> 28:14.069
I want a cookie.

28:14.110 --> 28:15.737
So, like, what do
they do all night?

28:15.779 --> 28:17.030
Like, prep for the next day?

28:17.072 --> 28:18.114
Sit around in bubble baths.

28:18.156 --> 28:19.324
Why are we 11?

28:19.366 --> 28:20.867
Oh, he's coming, he's coming.

28:20.909 --> 28:22.160
Oh, oh!

28:22.202 --> 28:23.787
Did you guys want
something more to drink?

28:23.828 --> 28:24.954
What about, like, just, like, a
straight tequila shot, anybody?

28:24.996 --> 28:26.373
I'll do the Purple Rain.

28:26.414 --> 28:28.458
-One, two, three tequilas.
-I can't say no.

28:28.500 --> 28:30.877
Tequila, please.

28:30.919 --> 28:32.796
-[bleep] me.
-What do they want?

28:32.837 --> 28:33.797
Purple Rains and tequilas.

28:33.838 --> 28:35.340
Ooh.

28:35.382 --> 28:36.883
I think we might actually
have a late one.

28:36.925 --> 28:39.010
Got a lot to do, don't we?

28:41.805 --> 28:43.056
Yeah.

28:45.183 --> 28:47.519
They're really slow
at making drinks.

28:47.560 --> 28:49.396
This is the worst
bottle service.

28:49.437 --> 28:51.606
But I do think we have time.

28:51.648 --> 28:53.108
Cheers.

28:54.359 --> 28:56.528
-What do you want?
-Probably eight tequila shots.

28:56.569 --> 28:58.113
-Espresso martini.
-Thank you so much.

28:58.154 --> 28:59.155
You guys are hardcore.

28:59.197 --> 29:00.657
Cheers, you guys!

29:00.699 --> 29:03.660
Can we possibly request
some, like, pizza bites,

29:03.702 --> 29:05.995
or, like, something
like drunk-friendly?

29:06.037 --> 29:07.163
Like, because...

29:07.205 --> 29:08.456
-Night club?
-Yeah, yeah.

29:11.126 --> 29:13.003
One of the guests
has just come to me.

29:13.044 --> 29:14.421
They want food now.

29:14.462 --> 29:16.756
There's no way
I'm waking up Dave.

29:16.798 --> 29:19.009
I don't know, maybe we can make
them toasties or something.

29:19.050 --> 29:21.011
You are testing me.

29:21.052 --> 29:24.514
4:00 a.m.
in the f'ing morning.

29:24.556 --> 29:26.474
Like, girl.

29:27.767 --> 29:29.060
Are we keeping them up?

29:29.102 --> 29:30.395
It's done.

29:30.437 --> 29:31.563
They are aware they're supposed

29:31.604 --> 29:33.231
to leave at 12:00
tomorrow, yeah?

29:33.273 --> 29:36.192
Who's interested in a
hot tub time machine,

29:36.234 --> 29:39.029
potentially could take us back
to two days ago.

29:39.070 --> 29:41.448
[humming]

29:41.489 --> 29:43.575
-They're definitely...
-I'm hatin' it.

29:43.616 --> 29:45.869
Wow!

29:45.910 --> 29:47.078
She's gotta go to sleep.

29:47.120 --> 29:50.081
And that's a wrap.

29:50.123 --> 29:52.375
Thank you so much.

29:52.417 --> 29:54.836
-Aw!
-Some nachos.

29:56.796 --> 29:59.049
Right, Kyle, I am actually
going to bed now.

29:59.090 --> 30:00.759
No, you should.

30:02.594 --> 30:03.636
See you in...

30:03.678 --> 30:04.888
Surely, they'll go to
bed after that.

30:04.929 --> 30:06.848
Hopefully.

30:14.814 --> 30:16.399
Ugh, ladies, ladies, ladies.

30:16.441 --> 30:18.777
-Woo!
-Let's go.

30:21.738 --> 30:23.281
Thank God.

30:23.323 --> 30:24.741
Okay, good night,
dolls, love you.

30:24.783 --> 30:26.409
Good night.

30:30.955 --> 30:32.332
Oh.

30:45.470 --> 30:47.263
Happy birthday, boy.

30:47.305 --> 30:49.140
Sure, brü.

30:50.767 --> 30:52.894
Oh, got a sick day.

30:52.936 --> 30:54.479
It is gonna be fun.

30:56.564 --> 30:58.817
Oh, my God,
the floors need vacuuming.

31:05.073 --> 31:07.158
[sighs]

31:12.372 --> 31:13.915
----ing fly.

31:15.083 --> 31:17.168
They must have got
lit last night.

31:18.753 --> 31:19.796
Which is fantastic.

31:19.838 --> 31:23.925
Mzi, happy birthday!

31:23.967 --> 31:27.137
My birthday celebrations, when I
first started off in university,

31:27.178 --> 31:29.681
we started national Mzi week,

31:29.723 --> 31:34.477
and then as time went by it
became international Mzi week.

31:34.519 --> 31:38.398
And basically,
every day of my birthday week

31:38.440 --> 31:39.816
just became a
different activity.

31:39.858 --> 31:41.818
So, this is very,
very different.

31:41.860 --> 31:44.988
Obviously, I'm just keeping
to my one day now.

31:45.030 --> 31:46.489
Do you want me to flash you?

31:46.531 --> 31:49.284
-Storm's here, no.
-Oh sh--, sh--, sh--.

31:49.325 --> 31:51.244
-No, no, no.
-Hey, I condone it.

31:51.286 --> 31:53.747
Oh, my God, the floors
need vacuuming.

32:03.798 --> 32:06.843
Hey, is that your lap...
whose laptop is this?

32:09.763 --> 32:11.556
Oh, tell her to keep it
down in her cabin.

32:11.598 --> 32:12.891
I will, I'll come get it back
in here.

32:12.932 --> 32:14.184
Okay, thank you.

32:14.225 --> 32:15.226
I'm a bit behind with
the sched today.

32:15.268 --> 32:16.728
Don't be worried.

32:16.770 --> 32:19.356
Yeah, listen, I saw you this
morning, working hard.

32:19.397 --> 32:21.107
Right, and it's freaking me out,

32:21.149 --> 32:22.859
because I wake up, there's not
one thing pulled for breakfast,

32:22.901 --> 32:24.527
the pantry's a mess,

32:24.569 --> 32:25.612
all the décor from the night
is still out, and it's...

32:25.653 --> 32:27.655
I'm just getting overwhelmed.

32:27.697 --> 32:30.367
Chief stew and Kyle were up to
3:30 in the morning together.

32:30.408 --> 32:31.785
I've never been on
a boat where, like...

32:31.826 --> 32:33.578
Right, that's not okay.

32:40.085 --> 32:42.837
I would never leave the pantry

32:42.879 --> 32:45.173
for someone to walk into
and take over in service.

32:45.215 --> 32:47.050
The night person should
have that thing immaculate.

32:47.092 --> 32:48.259
The floors should be clean,

32:48.301 --> 32:49.761
the decorations should
be packed away.

32:49.803 --> 32:52.097
Maybe I shouldn't say it
in front of Captain Sandy,

32:52.138 --> 32:53.556
but I am fuming.

32:53.598 --> 32:55.016
We're here to get a job done.

32:55.058 --> 32:56.726
Get it done.
That's it.

32:56.768 --> 33:06.820
Don't worry,
I'll take care of it.

33:06.820 --> 33:16.830
Don't worry,
I'll take care of it.

33:28.675 --> 33:29.175
This is not good.

33:30.385 --> 33:32.012
Where is she?

33:32.053 --> 33:35.515
Right now, I'm witnessing
Natasha slipping in some areas

33:35.557 --> 33:37.851
that really weren't the norm
in the beginning.

33:37.892 --> 33:40.353
Can we get the
stew pantry clean, please?

33:40.395 --> 33:42.564
I need this to be clean.

33:42.605 --> 33:44.399
Like, come on,
let's put things away.

33:44.441 --> 33:47.360
Hey, you gotta get
organized up there,

33:47.402 --> 33:49.863
-it's driving me insane, okay?
-What?

33:49.904 --> 33:53.074
The pantry,
it's a ----ing disaster.

33:53.116 --> 33:55.827
Sorry.

33:55.869 --> 33:58.788
And that's the stuff
that drives me crazy.

34:06.254 --> 34:07.380
-Hi, you!
-Hi!

34:07.422 --> 34:09.215
Good morning.

34:09.257 --> 34:10.216
How are you guys feeling?

34:10.258 --> 34:11.217
-Fine, actually.
-Really?

34:11.259 --> 34:12.719
Oh, I'm fine.

34:12.761 --> 34:15.430
I didn't behave like a
lunatic last night.

34:15.472 --> 34:16.514
Would you like ice this morning?

34:16.556 --> 34:17.974
Yeah, I'll do ice water.

34:18.016 --> 34:20.018
Chill out for a bit and
then breakfast later, easy.

34:20.060 --> 34:22.145
Good morning!

34:22.187 --> 34:24.272
Good morning, princess.

34:24.314 --> 34:25.899
How was your evening?

34:28.860 --> 34:30.236
Did you have a good night?

34:30.278 --> 34:31.529
So fun, yes.

34:31.571 --> 34:32.906
If you want skis,
I could put them in.

34:32.947 --> 34:34.407
-Do you want the skis?
-Yes!

34:34.449 --> 34:35.408
-Thank you.
-Cool, no problem.

34:35.450 --> 34:36.409
Hey, good morning.

34:36.451 --> 34:37.744
<i>Courts for Storm.</i>

34:37.786 --> 34:38.953
<i>They want the skis</i>
<i>in the water.</i>

34:38.995 --> 34:39.788
Coming now.

34:39.829 --> 34:41.247
Something's bothering me.

34:41.289 --> 34:43.124
Hit me, everyone else
is today, it's fine.

34:43.166 --> 34:45.085
We all know that
this can't be a thing, and...

34:45.126 --> 34:46.378
No, I know.

34:46.419 --> 34:48.213
Last night I was just like,
do you know what,

34:48.254 --> 34:49.964
we need to get up,
it's drop-off day...

34:50.006 --> 34:51.883
I know, but this is
from the first night.

34:51.925 --> 34:54.803
Well, I wasn't on the
boat all day yesterday.

34:54.844 --> 34:57.681
Okay, that was... you were
gone for a couple of hours.

34:57.722 --> 34:59.265
That needs to be managed better.

34:59.307 --> 35:01.017
Either the boat's gotta
be clean in the morning,

35:01.059 --> 35:02.310
or breakfast has gotta be
fully pulled.

35:02.352 --> 35:03.812
It's gotta be one or the other,

35:03.853 --> 35:05.438
because I don't have time
to open the morning

35:05.480 --> 35:06.940
and pull for breakfast while
also trying to clean the yacht.

35:06.981 --> 35:08.566
Do you know what,
if you wanna do service,

35:08.608 --> 35:09.943
I'll go and clean now,
it's fine.

35:09.984 --> 35:11.486
You're literally...
I'm not trying to...

35:11.528 --> 35:12.570
You just have to...
no, it's fine.

35:12.612 --> 35:13.571
No, but you're taking--

35:13.613 --> 35:15.198
I can go clean now, if you want.

35:15.240 --> 35:16.449
You're being dramatic.
I'm just saying, this is...

35:16.491 --> 35:17.784
I'm not being dramatic.

35:17.826 --> 35:18.785
I said do you wanna do service,
and I can clean.

35:18.827 --> 35:20.453
No, I'm happy to clean.

35:20.495 --> 35:21.788
I'm saying that something
in the morning has to give.

35:21.830 --> 35:23.039
Either the boat's gotta be clean

35:23.081 --> 35:24.582
or breakfast has got
to be pulled.

35:24.624 --> 35:26.209
It can't be the boat's a
sh---show

35:26.251 --> 35:27.877
from the bridge deck down
and nothing's pulled at all.

35:27.919 --> 35:31.256
The way Natalya is speaking
to me is not respectful.

35:31.297 --> 35:34.009
It's like, do you realize
the amount of extra hours

35:34.050 --> 35:35.844
that I've been putting in
making sure

35:35.885 --> 35:37.679
that the guests have
everything that they want

35:37.721 --> 35:40.223
to enhance our tips as a team?

35:40.265 --> 35:43.476
I think Natalya wants to be
the chief stew,

35:43.518 --> 35:45.979
and she just tries
to make me look bad

35:46.021 --> 35:48.231
to potentially look
better herself.

35:48.273 --> 35:51.317
I think it better if
Kyle gets the boat clean

35:51.359 --> 35:52.652
and then he wakes up later.

35:52.694 --> 35:53.778
Okay, we'll do that.

35:53.820 --> 35:55.030
That'd be amazing, thank you.

35:59.784 --> 36:01.995
Mzi, it's your birthday.
Do you wanna go in or not?

36:02.037 --> 36:03.496
-Yeah, I'll jump.
-Are you sure?

36:03.538 --> 36:04.789
Yeah.

36:08.168 --> 36:10.045
Let's do it.

36:10.086 --> 36:11.671
Woo!

36:54.631 --> 36:56.383
Enjoy your final breakfast.

36:56.424 --> 36:58.635
-Oh!
-Thank you.

37:03.264 --> 37:06.017
Just wanna be able to keep my
eye on when they're coming in.

37:07.102 --> 37:08.103
Good morning!

37:08.144 --> 37:09.396
-How are you?
-You okay?

37:09.437 --> 37:10.605
I'm good, how are you?

37:10.647 --> 37:12.148
Good, thanks.

37:12.190 --> 37:14.067
Interior, interior,
that's the guests off

37:14.109 --> 37:16.361
the swim platform and heading
up to breakfast shortly.

37:16.403 --> 37:19.239
Deck crew, deck crew,
all water toys on board.

37:19.280 --> 37:21.241
I'm leaving right
after guest departure.

37:21.282 --> 37:22.826
Copy that.

37:22.867 --> 37:25.203
Storm, Storm, do you want me to
head in for the jet-skis now?

37:29.666 --> 37:31.960
Jason's there, do you wanna
just tell him on your way?

37:36.464 --> 37:38.299
Come sit over here.

37:43.930 --> 37:45.849
Jason, would you mind
just trying to pull in anything

37:45.890 --> 37:47.225
that you can on the aft?

37:47.267 --> 37:49.060
Like, what are you...
what are you doing?

37:49.102 --> 37:50.729
So, we're gonna pull in the
jet-skis, and Courts is...

37:50.770 --> 37:52.272
Oh, just pull in, like,
inflatables and stuff?

37:52.313 --> 37:54.274
Yeah, just pull all of that
stuff in that we can get.

37:54.315 --> 37:55.191
Okay.

37:55.233 --> 37:57.652
-And we can get going.
-Yep.

37:57.694 --> 38:00.321
Jason is an asset,
but at the same time,

38:00.363 --> 38:02.365
like, when you're blowing
hot and cold all the time

38:02.407 --> 38:04.659
how do you sort of control that?

38:09.998 --> 38:10.999
Line up.

38:12.751 --> 38:14.252
Do you want me to take two?

38:14.294 --> 38:15.670
Oh, yes, please, hon.

38:17.505 --> 38:19.549
Mushroom eggs Benedict.

38:19.591 --> 38:21.426
-Woo!
-Oh, wow.

38:21.468 --> 38:22.719
It looks insane, doesn't it?

38:22.761 --> 38:24.387
-Yes.
-Stunning.

38:24.429 --> 38:25.889
Look how beautiful that is.

38:28.725 --> 38:30.185
Oh, I haven't hacked that.

38:33.021 --> 38:34.814
Top of the morning to you.

38:34.856 --> 38:36.858
Yeah, you guys need
to get organized.

38:36.900 --> 38:39.277
It's this frikkin' mess
every day I get up.

38:40.653 --> 38:43.823
That was never
looking like that.

38:43.865 --> 38:46.743
That stain has been there
for two days,

38:46.785 --> 38:48.661
and I wanna vomit in
my mouth when I see it.

38:48.703 --> 38:50.872
You guys, great on service...

38:50.914 --> 38:52.415
this needs a lot of work.

38:52.457 --> 38:54.000
And the one that's always
in the laundry

38:54.042 --> 38:55.710
is the one that's always
cleaning up.

38:55.752 --> 38:58.004
-I... I... like...
-It's not fair.

38:58.046 --> 39:00.256
-Just saying.
-Thank you.

39:02.050 --> 39:03.843
I don't even know what to say.

39:03.885 --> 39:06.596
Oh, my God,
what the [bleep] is happening?

39:06.638 --> 39:08.598
Like, I don't even know.

39:23.363 --> 39:23.613
Stop!

39:24.698 --> 39:26.658
I'm really uncomfortable.

39:26.700 --> 39:28.284
-Put on whites?
-Yes, please.

39:28.326 --> 39:29.994
Goodbye, table!

39:33.748 --> 39:35.250
Okay, babe, do you wanna go off?

39:35.291 --> 39:38.461
Yeah... she came and told me
what her problem was.

39:38.503 --> 39:39.963
She says this entire
pantry disgusts her.

39:40.005 --> 39:41.631
Well, I know, did you...

39:41.673 --> 39:43.717
She said that she wants to vomit
every time she sees this area.

39:43.758 --> 39:47.178
So, she was saying how Natalya
is always the one cleaning here.

39:50.348 --> 39:52.017
Oh, okay.

39:52.058 --> 39:53.685
Natalya has been making it very
verbal

39:53.727 --> 39:55.228
that she's been working
harder than everybody else,

39:55.270 --> 40:00.150
so I have very fishy suspicions.

40:00.191 --> 40:02.318
It's a fish market out
here at the moment.

40:02.360 --> 40:05.280
I didn't put the napkins there.

40:05.321 --> 40:06.614
-That's what I'm saying.
-Yeah.

40:06.656 --> 40:08.158
And how did the napkin rings
run up here?

40:08.199 --> 40:09.617
Who did breakfast service
this morning?

40:09.659 --> 40:11.161
-I didn't put them there.
-Exactly my point.

40:11.202 --> 40:13.038
So, Natalya isn't the
five-star show

40:13.079 --> 40:14.372
that everybody thinks her, so...

40:14.414 --> 40:15.707
Yeah.

40:15.749 --> 40:17.167
Okay, how does it go?

40:17.208 --> 40:19.169
I actually don't mind not
going out tonight

40:19.210 --> 40:20.420
and staying and
doing the pantry.

40:20.462 --> 40:22.464
I'm so with you.
I'm dead-ass.

40:22.505 --> 40:24.632
You want me to clean,
I'll clean for you.

40:26.134 --> 40:27.677
-Nat?
-Yes?

40:27.719 --> 40:29.304
We're at a bit of a standstill.

40:29.346 --> 40:31.181
Captain literally threw
the interior under the bus.

40:31.222 --> 40:32.557
Captain?

40:32.599 --> 40:34.893
How she says that pantry's
absolutely a vom show,

40:34.934 --> 40:36.561
she wants to vomit
every time, she said.

40:36.603 --> 40:40.023
And the only person she sees
ever cleaning it is you.

40:40.065 --> 40:41.524
Like, we spend more
time with the guests.

40:41.566 --> 40:43.360
How are we supposed
to clean this sh-- up?

40:43.401 --> 40:45.195
There's eight ----ing
crewmembers, and I'm, like,

40:45.236 --> 40:46.446
I wanted to say, Cap, you don't
understand how many times

40:46.488 --> 40:48.281
I'm busting my ass
in housekeeping,

40:48.323 --> 40:51.534
assisting Natalya, and how every
time we maintain this as well,

40:51.576 --> 40:53.036
it gets messed up...

40:53.078 --> 40:56.998
Ooh, there's some sh--
that's going down.

40:57.040 --> 40:58.041
So, I think we should
pinpointing crewmembers

40:58.083 --> 40:59.959
who does what.

41:05.674 --> 41:07.425
Yeah, I'm the snitch.

41:07.467 --> 41:11.054
I told Captain Sandy because
I was gonna knock someone out.

41:11.096 --> 41:13.765
Like, they needed it.
Their minds are elsewhere.

41:13.807 --> 41:14.933
I'm not gonna apologize.

41:14.974 --> 41:17.018
Enough's enough.

41:17.060 --> 41:19.396
Okay, cool, everyone's
really positive.

41:19.437 --> 41:23.024
Storm, Storm, I am departing
here at 1:00 p.m.

41:23.066 --> 41:24.234
Copy that.

41:24.275 --> 41:25.527
Okay, Mzi, you put on the stern,

41:25.568 --> 41:27.320
because we're gonna
go bow to stern.

41:27.362 --> 41:29.614
-Bow to stern.
-Yeah, yeah.

41:32.409 --> 41:33.576
We brought so much stuff.

41:33.618 --> 41:35.245
I don't...

41:35.286 --> 41:37.831
I literally don't think I'm
gonna fit all of my items.

41:37.872 --> 41:39.791
Slow her down, there you go.

41:39.833 --> 41:41.793
I'm lined up.

41:41.835 --> 41:42.961
Yeah, it's looking fine here.

41:43.003 --> 41:44.546
Ooh, fire.

41:44.587 --> 41:47.424
All crew, all crew,
guest departure in 20 minutes.

41:50.885 --> 41:53.179
So, I recently started
watching makeup tutorials

41:53.221 --> 41:55.974
to try to figure out actually
how to do makeup.

42:05.734 --> 42:09.696
If there's one thing that I
cannot stand, it is a snitch.

42:09.738 --> 42:13.366
If Natalya told on us,
I'm gonna be upset.

42:13.408 --> 42:15.994
There's no reason
to betray me like that.

42:16.036 --> 42:18.371
Bitch, you know what?

42:22.500 --> 42:24.210
Final checks.

42:26.087 --> 42:28.631
Jason, Jason, Tash.

42:28.673 --> 42:30.800
Are you free, please,
to give us a hand at luggage?

42:30.842 --> 42:34.179
Oh, look at you... show-off.

42:41.519 --> 42:43.021
Good?

42:43.063 --> 42:46.066
Come up, then, because it's
awkward for them on the stairs.

42:46.107 --> 42:48.526
-Bye!
-Bye.

42:48.568 --> 42:50.195
Thank you so much!

42:50.236 --> 42:51.196
Thank you very much
for everything.

42:51.237 --> 42:52.739
Bye, happy birthday!

42:52.781 --> 42:54.115
Thank you so much.

42:54.157 --> 42:56.201
Honestly, you guys,
like, this entire trip

42:56.242 --> 42:58.328
has just made me feel so happy.

42:58.370 --> 43:01.539
You guys were killing it
with every single water toy.

43:01.581 --> 43:04.834
And, like, thank you just
for making us feel at home.

43:04.876 --> 43:06.211
Aw!

43:06.252 --> 43:07.587
I really thank you.
This is for you guys.

43:07.629 --> 43:09.673
-Thank you, appreciate it.
-Thank you all!

43:09.714 --> 43:10.715
We'll see you next year!

43:10.757 --> 43:13.677
We'll see you in America!

43:13.718 --> 43:14.844
-USA, USA, right?
-Next time in America.

43:14.886 --> 43:17.597
-Bye, you guys!
-Bye!

43:17.639 --> 43:19.683
We love you guys!

43:23.019 --> 43:24.854
All right, everyone,
we're gonna do our tip meeting

43:24.896 --> 43:25.855
when we're back at the docks.

43:25.897 --> 43:27.399
All right.

43:27.440 --> 43:28.692
As soon as you can get
that loaded, we're underway.

43:28.733 --> 43:30.360
Thanks, Cap.

43:30.402 --> 43:31.695
Let's go, girl, to get changed
quick, or just get into...

43:31.736 --> 43:32.821
Yeah, yeah.

43:32.862 --> 43:34.030
Natasha, can I see you on
the bridge?

43:34.072 --> 43:35.615
Sure thing.

43:35.657 --> 43:39.411
Well, guys, give yourselves
a pat on the back, go on.

43:43.581 --> 43:44.749
Yeah, exactly.

43:45.750 --> 43:47.252
Oh [bleep].

43:57.804 --> 43:59.723
[sighs]

43:59.764 --> 44:01.266
Hey.
