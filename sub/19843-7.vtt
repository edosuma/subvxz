WEBVTT

00:55.630 --> 00:56.676
Shit.

01:04.690 --> 01:06.681
It's, uh...
it’s
5/7ybum mar/'anum.

01:07.650 --> 01:09.140
Milk thistle.
It's good for the liver.

01:11.860 --> 01:16.399
Why is it that a man who is
so obsessed with his own longevity...

01:17.320 --> 01:20.904
can be so careless with the people
who control his fate?

01:22.410 --> 01:26.323
The Hand is concerned with
this rebellious streak you've shown.

01:27.250 --> 01:29.411
You left the confines
of your penthouse.

01:29.590 --> 01:32.297
I explained that already.
There was someone claiming to be...

01:32.460 --> 01:33.700
Danny Rand.

01:34.800 --> 01:36.870
The lost heir to your company, yes.

01:38.180 --> 01:40.501
He and Madame Gao
met earlier tonight.

01:41.810 --> 01:44.381
She finds it odd
that you failed to mention

01:44.560 --> 01:50.146
the man whose identity you helped restore
is also the legendary Iron Fist,

01:50.900 --> 01:52.606
the sworn enemy of the Hand.

01:52.860 --> 01:54.646
Danny Rand doesn't
even know I'm alive.

01:55.570 --> 01:58.061
I have no idea
what an Iron Fist is.

01:58.360 --> 01:59.611
Sounds like a sex toy.

02:02.870 --> 02:05.577
Maybe you really are
telling us the truth right now

02:05.750 --> 02:09.379
and you really have no idea
what you brought into this company.

02:10.630 --> 02:12.871
Maybe you really
are just a fool.

02:14.300 --> 02:16.916
And Madame Gao
can forgive foolishness...

02:22.300 --> 02:25.019
...but not without punishment.

02:27.640 --> 02:29.096
Vando...

02:30.230 --> 02:31.800
he was a fool once, too.

02:32.230 --> 02:33.470
Twice, actually.

02:34.530 --> 02:37.067
But he has a constant reminder
of his failure.

02:38.150 --> 02:40.903
The fingers were
because he screwed up.

02:42.160 --> 02:44.572
The tongue was
because he lied about it.

02:44.580 --> 02:45.649
The real question is,

02:46.450 --> 02:48.452
how big
a reminder do you need?

02:48.660 --> 02:50.742
Hey, listen to me.
I've done nothing wrong.

02:51.080 --> 02:54.993
I swear on the lives of my children,
I have nothing to do with Danny Rand.

02:57.210 --> 02:58.962
Harold, we have a problem.

03:51.890 --> 03:52.936
You killed them.

03:53.190 --> 03:56.478
What-- What choice did I have?
They were going to kill you, Danny.

03:59.570 --> 04:01.106
Why didn't you
summon the Iron Fist?

04:02.780 --> 04:04.020
I can't.

04:06.160 --> 04:08.071
I just used it
at the tournament.

04:10.200 --> 04:11.280
It drains my chi.

04:11.710 --> 04:14.577
Oh. The tournament?
That's where you met her?

04:15.250 --> 04:16.740
The woman behind the curtain?

04:17.590 --> 04:19.296
She... She challenged me.

04:19.760 --> 04:22.581
IfI won, she said the Hand
would leave New York.

04:23.090 --> 04:24.466
Oh.

04:24.680 --> 04:26.295
But then she
changed the rules.

04:26.890 --> 04:28.130
Well, you know what?
It doesn't matter.

04:28.560 --> 04:31.472
All that matters is they're onto us.
We need to move fast.

04:32.020 --> 04:35.262
- Who is she?
- Ah. Her name is Madame Gao.

04:35.650 --> 04:38.016
I, uh, met her on my deathbed.

04:38.400 --> 04:40.277
She's the one who
made the deal, Danny.

04:40.730 --> 04:43.278
Live in service to the Hand,
or die in the dark.

04:43.950 --> 04:45.235
She said she knew my father.

04:45.570 --> 04:46.559
What?

04:47.070 --> 04:48.571
She said he had no honour.

04:49.370 --> 04:50.735
Wendell never told me.

04:51.620 --> 04:54.248
- Told you what?
- I don't know.

04:56.750 --> 05:00.459
If Wendell knew Gao or the Hand,
he never shared it with me.

05:00.670 --> 05:02.410
I need to find out
how she knew my father.

05:02.590 --> 05:04.330
Hey, don't play her game.

05:04.630 --> 05:05.870
That's what she wants.

05:06.220 --> 05:07.756
Time isn't on our side.

05:08.220 --> 05:10.506
Look how out of control
this has already gotten.

05:11.390 --> 05:13.051
What I had to do to protect you.

05:15.270 --> 05:17.511
I don't know how much more of this
I can take.

05:19.150 --> 05:22.859
You know
what needs to be done to end this, Danny.

05:24.530 --> 05:25.815
What do we do with the bodies?

05:28.910 --> 05:31.947
I'll, uh... I'll take care of 'em.
I'll make 'em disappear.

05:32.410 --> 05:33.536
Gao will know they're missing,

05:33.700 --> 05:37.739
but as long as it looks as though
they did their job before they left...

05:40.920 --> 05:41.989
What job?

05:43.760 --> 05:45.625
To remind me of my mistakes.

07:04.250 --> 07:06.582
Do you understand
how stupid that was?

07:08.720 --> 07:10.210
What if someone had
seen you In there?

07:11.510 --> 07:14.252
I don't think anyone would recognise us
from the country club, Joy.

07:16.180 --> 07:17.920
Oh, come on.

07:27.990 --> 07:31.062
- You're slipping.
- I'm fine.

07:31.360 --> 07:32.406
You're fine?

07:33.450 --> 07:34.986
You're fine, like when I came
in the other night

07:35.080 --> 07:36.866
and I found you passed out
on your couch?

07:37.580 --> 07:39.616
I told you,
I took a muscle relaxer.

07:40.040 --> 07:41.450
What else have you been taking?

07:41.620 --> 07:43.247
I don't need your bullshit, Joy.

07:43.790 --> 07:46.702
You have no idea what my life is like.
No goddamn idea.

07:46.880 --> 07:49.508
- Because you won't tell me!
- I can't!

07:50.510 --> 07:52.171
I...

07:55.850 --> 07:57.806
You need help, Ward.

08:00.810 --> 08:04.348
What I need is for you
to stay out of my business.

08:04.940 --> 08:07.226
I have everything under control.

08:08.190 --> 08:11.023
Yeah. Yeah, well,
you know, I can see that.

08:16.580 --> 08:17.729
Who's Frank Stein?

08:19.870 --> 08:22.031
- Is he your dealer?
- No.

08:22.920 --> 08:25.161
Then who is he?

08:25.830 --> 08:26.956
Tell me.

08:33.260 --> 08:34.249
Fine.

08:34.970 --> 08:36.085
Enjoy your secrets.

08:48.020 --> 08:49.226
It's late.

08:49.530 --> 08:51.350
Wasn ’1' sure you
were gonna pick up this time.

08:52.070 --> 08:54.197
- I’m glad you did.
- What do you want?

08:54.910 --> 08:58.732
I need your help with something
over at the penthouse. It's important.

08:59.160 --> 09:00.730
Real/y not a good time.

09:01.040 --> 09:03.611
Hey, I need you, son.

09:05.750 --> 09:08.127
- You need me?
- Please.

09:13.300 --> 09:14.415
I'll be right there.

09:25.190 --> 09:27.055
Hold still.

09:27.850 --> 09:29.932
I haven't done this in a while.

09:31.610 --> 09:33.066
Maybe I should go
to the hospital.

09:33.780 --> 09:36.772
- I can tell 'em I got mugged.
- The hospital's not safe.

09:37.610 --> 09:39.111
And I can handle a few stitches.

09:39.320 --> 09:40.776
Oops.

09:40.950 --> 09:42.326
What?

09:42.830 --> 09:43.819
Hey.

09:44.200 --> 09:46.111
That's not something
I want to hear right now.

09:46.540 --> 09:47.666
I'm almost done.

09:56.090 --> 09:58.001
I don't think your
ribs are broken, but...

09:59.180 --> 10:01.421
they're pretty badly bruised.

10:02.310 --> 10:04.175
My whole body feels like a bruise.

10:04.810 --> 10:07.768
Well, any tournament of death
you can walk away from...

10:08.060 --> 10:09.186
I still lost.

10:10.610 --> 10:12.726
Sounds like it might have been
rigged to begin with.

10:14.400 --> 10:15.731
Madame Gao...

10:16.950 --> 10:19.987
she gave me a choice to win,
but I couldn't let Sabina die.

10:22.870 --> 10:24.076
Madame Gao.

10:24.870 --> 10:27.998
Not "Mrs Gao" or "Linda Gao."

10:28.870 --> 10:29.871
Why "Madame"?

10:30.790 --> 10:33.418
What, does she run the best little
whorehouse in the Hand or something?

10:35.510 --> 10:37.501
I'll be sure to ask
her once I find her.

10:40.970 --> 10:42.926
After I find out how
she knew my father.

10:43.260 --> 10:44.807
What if Gao was lying?

10:46.020 --> 10:48.591
Just trying to get in your head,
undermine your will to fight her.

10:48.770 --> 10:50.977
It's strategy straight out of
The Art of War.

10:56.740 --> 10:58.389
Oh, it's Claire.

10:58.950 --> 11:00.520
Sabina's safe.

11:09.710 --> 11:12.782
- Just trying to keep the wound clean.
- Yeah.

11:13.750 --> 11:15.126
Okay.

11:16.050 --> 11:17.950
Okay.

11:22.930 --> 11:24.136
Thanks.

11:38.320 --> 11:39.605
What are these for?

11:40.570 --> 11:41.730
'Cause I need a drink.

11:41.990 --> 11:45.482
And you're going to join me,
because I hate drinking alone.

11:55.710 --> 11:56.870
Glass.

12:06.100 --> 12:08.671
Back in the monastery,
Brother Kuo would...

12:09.060 --> 12:12.302
harvest plums every summer
to make wine.

12:12.890 --> 12:15.267
He used to hide it
in these big clay pots,

12:15.810 --> 12:18.563
have it ferment in the bell tower
over the winter.

12:19.740 --> 12:22.140
Me and my friend Davos,
when we were kids, we'd...

12:22.700 --> 12:24.907
we'd wait until the brothers
had gone to sleep

12:25.530 --> 12:27.270
and we'd climb up the tower.

12:29.830 --> 12:33.209
We'd, uh... we'd sneak drinks
and refill the pots with water

12:33.290 --> 12:34.496
so no one knew it was missing.

12:38.960 --> 12:40.291
The wine was so sweet.

12:40.710 --> 12:42.962
In the dead of winter,
it tasted warm...

12:46.340 --> 12:47.341
like summer.

12:48.970 --> 12:49.959
Tell me another one.

12:51.640 --> 12:52.720
Another story.

12:54.140 --> 12:55.186
About K'un-Lun.

12:58.020 --> 13:00.352
Man...

13:03.110 --> 13:04.646
I was there a long time.

13:05.860 --> 13:07.191
They aren't all great memories.

13:11.080 --> 13:12.786
How about how you
got that tattoo?

13:15.080 --> 13:17.287
Well...

13:17.710 --> 13:20.588
...it's not exactly a tattoo.

13:23.470 --> 13:25.119
It's the mark of the Iron Fist.

13:29.600 --> 13:30.715
Danny...

13:31.390 --> 13:35.383
I still do not understand
what that even means.

13:37.980 --> 13:39.106
It's a...

13:41.730 --> 13:43.186
It's a unique force...

13:44.780 --> 13:46.941
used to protect K'un-Lun.

13:47.950 --> 13:51.442
It's passed down from
generation to generation

13:51.950 --> 13:55.283
and it's given to one student
from the monastery to wield.

13:56.370 --> 13:57.917
Why were you chosen to get it?

13:58.330 --> 13:59.706
I wasn't chosen.

14:02.880 --> 14:03.869
I earned it.

14:05.970 --> 14:07.085
Okay, so...

14:09.090 --> 14:10.216
what does it do?

14:10.680 --> 14:12.921
It's complicated.

14:13.270 --> 14:14.305
But it...

14:16.940 --> 14:19.181
lets me harness my chi.

14:20.060 --> 14:21.766
It enhances my strength...

14:22.900 --> 14:23.889
my focus.

14:24.110 --> 14:25.099
And it, um...

14:26.150 --> 14:28.482
makes my hand light up.

14:32.450 --> 14:34.941
Look,
I know it sounds weird, okay?

14:35.160 --> 14:37.287
- I get it.
- Can you show me?

14:37.460 --> 14:40.076
No, I don't think so.

14:41.330 --> 14:43.742
Mm. What, do you think
I can't handle it?

14:44.800 --> 14:46.199
That I'm too weak?

14:46.970 --> 14:50.963
Colleen, you're one of
the strongest people I have ever met.

14:51.140 --> 14:52.880
Anywhere.

14:53.720 --> 14:56.382
I wasn't strong enough
to protect Radovan at the hospital.

14:58.390 --> 14:59.971
Hey,
look, that wasn't your fault.

15:00.690 --> 15:02.351
He was my responsibility.

15:03.820 --> 15:05.310
I was supposed
to protect him...

15:06.860 --> 15:10.159
and now Gao has him again
and we might never be able to find him.

15:14.330 --> 15:15.365
So, yeah...

15:17.450 --> 15:19.077
I guess we both lost tonight.

15:23.040 --> 15:25.747
You're going to keep trying...
aren't you?

15:27.840 --> 15:28.829
To stop...

15:30.260 --> 15:31.716
them?

15:33.600 --> 15:34.885
I can't quit now.

15:38.220 --> 15:39.300
I should go.

15:40.980 --> 15:43.642
- You can stay.
- No, I... I gotta...

15:43.980 --> 15:46.312
go to the office in the morning,
so I should...

15:46.730 --> 15:47.719
Danny...

15:50.280 --> 15:51.486
I want you to stay.

17:30.800 --> 17:32.665
- You sure?
- Yes.

17:35.340 --> 17:37.547
Definitely, yes.

18:40.160 --> 18:42.321
Oh,
Ward, it's about time.

18:53.670 --> 18:55.376
You okay, son?
You look a little green.

18:55.630 --> 18:57.336
Hey, what happened to your hand?

18:57.970 --> 19:00.086
What happened to yours?

19:01.050 --> 19:02.677
Oh, kitchen accident.

19:04.220 --> 19:05.426
Who are they?

19:06.680 --> 19:08.386
Oh, the one without
the tongue is Vando.

19:08.560 --> 19:10.972
The other guy,
I didn't get his name.

19:11.520 --> 19:13.181
The Hand sent them over
to deliver a message.

19:13.360 --> 19:15.521
- We have to call somebody.
- Yeah, I did. I called you.

19:15.860 --> 19:18.272
I need you to take their bodies
to Pelham Bay Park.

19:18.530 --> 19:20.350
Either the cops or the Hand
will find them eventually,

19:20.530 --> 19:23.317
but hopefully we'll be finished
this by then.

19:26.330 --> 19:29.208
They'll find it difficult to identify 'em
without their teeth.

19:31.330 --> 19:33.412
I'm almost ready to
wrap these guys up.

19:33.590 --> 19:36.241
- Then you can put 'em in your car.
- You said you needed me.

19:37.090 --> 19:38.079
Yeah, I do.

19:38.300 --> 19:41.178
You called me in the middle of the night
to dump bodies for you.

19:41.510 --> 19:43.637
Well, who else was
I gonna call, Ward?

19:44.510 --> 19:46.341
I knew you'd come. You always do.

19:52.810 --> 19:54.357
I could do with
an extra hand on this.

19:56.520 --> 19:57.521
Come on.

19:57.730 --> 20:00.392
Just like when we went deer hunting
when you were a kid.

20:00.650 --> 20:02.151
You have to clean your kill.

20:02.780 --> 20:04.316
We never went hunting.

20:04.490 --> 20:05.479
Oh.

20:06.580 --> 20:08.616
Oh, maybe it was your sister.

20:10.370 --> 20:12.531
Well, guess I'll do it myself, then.

20:27.470 --> 20:29.097
Come on!

20:29.890 --> 20:31.050
God.

20:33.020 --> 20:35.056
You can do this.

20:37.980 --> 20:39.220
You can do this.

21:59.940 --> 22:01.146
You think I don't know that?

22:03.740 --> 22:05.890
You think I don't know
how messed up this is?

22:11.660 --> 22:12.820
I'm not a child.

23:31.450 --> 23:32.439
Danny?

23:33.950 --> 23:34.939
Right here.

23:36.830 --> 23:38.240
How long have you been up?

23:38.700 --> 23:39.701
Not long.

23:41.620 --> 23:43.531
The city is always
so quiet this early.

23:54.510 --> 23:55.499
Yeah.

23:56.970 --> 23:57.959
It's nice.

24:01.060 --> 24:02.095
Yeah.

24:07.320 --> 24:08.435
About last night...

24:10.650 --> 24:11.696
Yeah.

24:13.320 --> 24:15.982
I've been living a very different life
for many years.

24:17.160 --> 24:18.650
There are certain
things I haven't...

24:22.620 --> 24:23.666
But last night was...

24:25.710 --> 24:27.792
I enjoyed it.

24:28.920 --> 24:30.410
A lot.

24:36.600 --> 24:37.840
I liked it, too.

24:41.100 --> 24:44.092
You know, this cloak of...

24:44.810 --> 24:48.189
I don't know,
bravado that you have...

24:49.900 --> 24:51.106
I know why you wear it.

24:52.900 --> 24:54.697
I do the same thing.

24:55.110 --> 24:57.237
It keeps people at bay, but...

24:58.740 --> 25:00.696
you know that you don't
have to wear it with me.

25:13.880 --> 25:16.678
Hey, I need you to find
all of my dad's old files.

25:17.090 --> 25:19.217
Okay. They're probably in storage.
Which ones do you want?

25:19.390 --> 25:22.223
Um... Anything
that mentions a woman named Gao.

25:22.390 --> 25:24.051
- Who's that?
- Um...

25:24.390 --> 25:26.642
Just... Just get everything
of my father's. All of it.

25:27.100 --> 25:28.761
And get them to
move it into my office.

25:29.070 --> 25:30.264
It's probably gonna
be a lot of files.

25:30.400 --> 25:32.311
Well, I have a pretty big office.

25:33.190 --> 25:35.442
- Danny.
- Oh, Joy, I was just about to...

25:35.610 --> 25:36.736
We need to talk.

25:37.700 --> 25:38.689
Now.

25:40.330 --> 25:41.319
Okay.

25:42.160 --> 25:43.286
"My actions were impulsive,

25:43.500 --> 25:45.741
and I_ now realise
the severity of my words."

25:47.170 --> 25:48.159
Is this an apology?

25:48.500 --> 25:51.549
No, it's the statement
you're gonna be making

25:51.710 --> 25:53.007
at the board meeting this afternoon.

25:54.510 --> 25:55.966
It sort of seems like an apology.

25:56.300 --> 25:57.289
Well...

25:58.050 --> 25:59.756
apologies are what got you
into this disaster,

25:59.930 --> 26:02.842
so, yeah,
officially, it's a statement.

26:03.720 --> 26:07.019
It's the first step of CIR's plan
to save the company's image.

26:08.150 --> 26:10.391
But... But what about the plant?

26:10.570 --> 26:11.559
What about it?

26:12.650 --> 26:16.063
- It might be making people sick.
- Danny, we don't know what's causing it.

26:16.400 --> 26:17.856
The EPA cleared us.

26:18.450 --> 26:20.270
Fifteen cases_of_cancer
can't be a comcrdence.

26:23.370 --> 26:26.248
Do you think that I don't care
about those people?

26:27.210 --> 26:28.199
I do.

26:28.620 --> 26:30.417
But I also care
about this company.

26:30.630 --> 26:33.702
And right now, I seem to be the only one
here who is taking this seriously.

26:33.880 --> 26:35.336
I mean, I have no idea where Ward is.

26:36.300 --> 26:38.427
And you don't even show up
for the CIR meeting.

26:38.720 --> 26:41.462
And when you do show up to work,
your face is beat to shit?

26:42.850 --> 26:44.670
You're the one that wanted
Into this company, rIght?

26:45.180 --> 26:46.590
You fought like hell to get it.

26:47.100 --> 26:50.809
Well, now is the time
for the hard work to actually start.

26:51.650 --> 26:56.064
I need you to just do what I say
at this meeting today

26:56.240 --> 26:58.526
so we can get
this situation fixed.

27:01.950 --> 27:04.077
- Danny?
- Hey, I'll be there, okay?

27:09.210 --> 27:12.282
You really need to take
better care of yourself, Danny.

27:13.460 --> 27:16.543
This room has
terrible feng shui.

27:17.720 --> 27:19.119
Too many angles.

27:20.010 --> 27:23.298
Poison arrows _
can weaken the soul over tIme.

27:25.970 --> 27:27.426
That's better.
Don't you agree?

27:27.980 --> 27:29.345
How did you get in here?

27:30.600 --> 27:33.558
I've been in Rand
far longer than you have.

27:34.150 --> 27:36.857
And I don't plan
on leaving anytime soon.

27:39.860 --> 27:45.071
You're not going to attack an old woman
in front of all your employees, are you?

27:45.490 --> 27:49.529
I think Danny Rand is in
enough trouble around here.

27:50.250 --> 27:51.365
I passed your test.

27:53.000 --> 27:53.989
You know who I am.

27:54.500 --> 27:55.626
What I can do.

27:57.130 --> 28:01.920
You're not the first I've met _
to carry the mantle of the Iron FIst.

28:03.050 --> 28:05.462
Is that why you use that symbol
on your heroin packages?

28:06.180 --> 28:08.057
The dragon without the wings?

28:08.890 --> 28:12.223
The other Iron Fists I've known
were fierce,

28:12.770 --> 28:17.013
unrelenting in their mission
to protect K'un-Lun from the Hand.

28:18.190 --> 28:21.318
They would never have backed down
from a grand duel

28:21.490 --> 28:24.152
just to save the life of one girl.

28:27.490 --> 28:28.536
How did you know my father?

28:31.960 --> 28:38.331
I've been alive long enough
to watch the world change in many ways.

28:39.380 --> 28:43.828
But this change now,
it feels significant.

28:45.050 --> 28:47.553
The Devil of Hell's Kitchen.

28:47.850 --> 28:50.387
The man with unbreakable skin.

28:50.850 --> 28:54.968
And now, an immortal weapon
has left K'un-Lun,

28:55.230 --> 28:59.769
not to fulfil his duty,
but in dereliction of it.

29:00.070 --> 29:05.565
History says that the Iron Fist
and the Hand are mortal enemies.

29:05.870 --> 29:09.362
But I wonder...
in the spirit of change,

29:10.370 --> 29:13.248
perhaps we can be
something different.

29:15.420 --> 29:17.285
Last night
showed me the truth.

29:18.880 --> 29:21.667
K'un-Lun did not send you
to hunt us down.

29:22.720 --> 29:25.792
You left of _
your own free wnll,

29:26.640 --> 29:29.928
because you wanted
to be Danny Rand.

29:31.520 --> 29:36.344
So, why not enjoy the life
you travelled so far for?

29:37.440 --> 29:38.509
I need your company.

29:40.110 --> 29:44.069
But the spoils are for you to enjoy.

29:45.320 --> 29:46.526
Buy a yacht.

29:47.160 --> 29:49.822
Eat at fancy restaurants
with your friends,

29:50.120 --> 29:53.328
like Claire Temple
and Colleen Wing.

29:56.170 --> 29:57.489
Stop your war.

29:58.330 --> 30:01.879
This city is no
place for the Iron Fist.

30:07.300 --> 30:09.757
You're a businessman now...

30:11.140 --> 30:16.589
and this is the best offer
you are ever gomg to get.

30:23.440 --> 30:24.429
My father...

30:26.650 --> 30:28.151
did you make him an offer too?

30:32.370 --> 30:34.907
Don't forget to water
your plant, Danny.

30:35.330 --> 30:37.912
It is your responsibility now.

31:31.720 --> 31:34.382
Yamao’e wa
Buddha, please watch me
and guide over my descent.

31:37.270 --> 31:38.555
This is probably gonna hurt.

33:00.640 --> 33:01.880
Ward? Hey.

33:02.600 --> 33:06.684
I, uh, I talked to Danny.
He said he's gonna apologise to the board.

33:07.940 --> 33:08.975
Great.

33:13.820 --> 33:15.310
Hey, listen.

33:16.320 --> 33:18.322
I'm sorry I snapped at you last night.

33:20.290 --> 33:21.860
I love you.

33:22.450 --> 33:25.419
And... I mean, you...
you're the only family I have left.

33:26.580 --> 33:29.708
And maybe what's happening to you
is partly my fault, too.

33:31.170 --> 33:32.967
Sometimes, it's...
It's just easier to...

33:33.840 --> 33:36.047
pretend nothing's wrong
than to say something.

33:52.190 --> 33:53.600
Maybe you should take a break.

33:55.490 --> 33:57.446
Just... for a few weeks.

33:59.450 --> 34:00.860
I can handle things here.

34:02.700 --> 34:03.860
There are places...

34:05.120 --> 34:07.327
discreet places...

34:09.080 --> 34:10.081
that could help you.

34:14.920 --> 34:16.376
I think that's a good idea.

34:17.630 --> 34:19.131
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

34:19.850 --> 34:21.215
Okay.

34:22.930 --> 34:23.919
Come here.

34:33.650 --> 34:37.063
You just gotta let me know you're safe.

34:39.160 --> 34:40.559
I'm here for you.

34:42.240 --> 34:45.289
The Russians have agreed
to carry our product exclusively,

34:45.450 --> 34:48.328
which covers most of Lower Manhattan
and New Jersey.

34:49.040 --> 34:52.624
The Dogs of Hell will be using Rand trucks
to deliver to the south.

34:53.840 --> 34:56.968
The rest of our partners will be using
the company's shipping network

34:57.130 --> 34:59.792
to cover the entire Eastern Seaboard
within the next month.

34:59.970 --> 35:01.176
They are not our partners.

35:01.760 --> 35:02.920
They work for us.

35:03.260 --> 35:05.558
- You need to remind them of that.
- Yes, ma'am.

35:06.850 --> 35:08.886
Demand is higher
than we anticipated.

35:09.560 --> 35:11.391
As long as supply
can keep up with orders,

35:11.610 --> 35:14.682
we should be reaching our sales goal
within the next three months.

35:14.940 --> 35:16.066
Quantity is not an issue.

35:17.320 --> 35:19.606
The chemist is almost ready
to give up his formula.

35:20.030 --> 35:23.329
And once he does that,
we can begin mass production.

35:23.910 --> 35:25.866
There are still holdouts,
like Hai-Qing Yang.

35:26.870 --> 35:29.156
The Hatchet Men won't be
a problem much longer.

35:30.580 --> 35:32.127
- Anything else?
- No, ma'am.

35:37.010 --> 35:39.797
We should brighten
up this office, yes?

35:40.880 --> 35:42.677
I'll put in an order for some lamps.

35:52.560 --> 35:53.549
Come.

36:18.510 --> 36:19.659
You shouldn't be here.

36:24.050 --> 36:26.211
Why, Mr Rand, I have a mind
to report you to HR.

36:26.430 --> 36:27.590
You think this is a game?

36:27.850 --> 36:30.262
You're using my company,
my building, to sell poison!

36:30.600 --> 36:33.228
Is that really so different than
what you're doing on the top floor?

36:36.690 --> 36:37.679
Do it.

36:43.950 --> 36:45.110
You're scared.

36:46.490 --> 36:47.900
You don't even have a choice.

36:50.910 --> 36:52.491
You can't go back to Gao.

36:55.080 --> 36:57.162
She killed the last guy
who failed to defeat me.

36:57.540 --> 36:58.871
Turned his head
into a mailbox.

36:59.500 --> 37:00.706
I'm giving you a new choice.

37:01.260 --> 37:02.466
You're gonna
leave my building.

37:03.300 --> 37:05.131
You're gonna run,
and you're never coming back.

37:07.140 --> 37:08.175
They'll find me.

37:08.600 --> 37:10.170
That's why you're
gonna give me your password.

37:11.810 --> 37:13.095
So I can find them first.

37:29.830 --> 37:31.900
Your form's getting
a little sloppy, Colleen.

37:35.460 --> 37:36.666
Bakuto.

37:41.460 --> 37:42.916
I didn't know you were coming.

37:43.300 --> 37:46.258
I was just warming up.

37:47.430 --> 37:48.715
Mm. Obviously.

37:50.680 --> 37:52.921
I only recently got back into the city.

37:54.430 --> 37:55.886
I heard the dojo's
under new management?

37:57.060 --> 37:58.891
Ownership, not management.

38:00.820 --> 38:02.139
And that's your Danny Rand?

38:09.030 --> 38:11.658
The Iron Fist.
It's really him.

38:12.790 --> 38:13.905
The way he fights...

38:14.960 --> 38:18.282
Not just his body, but...
his heart.

38:19.710 --> 38:21.701
It's like a second language to him.
It's... it's...

38:22.880 --> 38:24.620
It's inspiring.

38:26.930 --> 38:29.137
It sounds like you
truly care for him.

38:30.800 --> 38:32.097
Are you trying to make me jealous?

38:34.220 --> 38:36.222
You will always come first for me.

38:38.810 --> 38:39.936
You need to be cautious.

38:41.440 --> 38:43.146
He's begun to
attract a lot of attention.

38:44.440 --> 38:45.520
Comes a great deal of danger.

38:46.240 --> 38:48.947
Mm. I am aware. Believe me.

38:50.870 --> 38:52.610
For now,
keep doing as you are.

38:54.330 --> 38:55.536
I'll be in touch.

38:56.500 --> 38:57.489
Okay.

39:08.680 --> 39:09.795
Danny.

39:10.890 --> 39:13.381
What happened to you?
The board will be here in a minute.

39:13.560 --> 39:14.595
Oh, um...

39:14.850 --> 39:16.636
Uh. Come on. Come on.

39:24.570 --> 39:26.026
Here. Put this on.

39:26.610 --> 39:27.599
Thanks.

39:36.700 --> 39:39.112
- What's this?
- Those are the files you asked for.

39:40.960 --> 39:44.202
Where's everything else?
All of my father's things?

39:44.380 --> 39:45.790
That's all I could find in storage.

39:46.710 --> 39:48.712
It's been 15 years.
There was probably more,

39:48.880 --> 39:51.838
but things get moved around,
and then, eventually, they get lost.

39:57.140 --> 39:58.175
And forgotten.

40:04.820 --> 40:06.219
Do you think this
is a good company?

40:07.360 --> 40:08.896
To work? Sure.

40:09.530 --> 40:12.021
I mean, I lost my dental benefits
in the last contract negotiations,

40:12.200 --> 40:15.021
- and that kinda sucked...
- I... I mean, with the plant.

40:16.910 --> 40:19.242
- You saw the video, right?
- Yeah.

40:21.370 --> 40:23.076
What did you think?
It's not really my place to say.

40:23.170 --> 40:24.159
Hey.

40:25.000 --> 40:26.035
It's okay.

40:28.420 --> 40:30.297
My mother lives on Staten Island.

40:39.560 --> 40:41.300
I think I wanna
make a few phone calls.

40:43.770 --> 40:46.102
You said you had
this under control, Joy.

40:46.770 --> 40:47.759
He'll be here.

40:50.780 --> 40:53.271
Hey.

40:55.700 --> 40:56.689
You're late.

41:00.660 --> 41:01.991
Sorry, everyone. I, uh...

41:03.330 --> 41:05.286
I had a problem
with the elevator.

41:16.470 --> 41:18.097
I know some of you
aren't happy with me.

41:19.850 --> 41:21.420
And I know what
you want me to do.

41:22.930 --> 41:23.976
But...

41:25.150 --> 41:26.139
I've made a decision.

41:28.270 --> 41:30.181
_Until we can be sure
It Isn't causmg Illness,

41:30.980 --> 41:32.936
we're shutting down
the Staten Island plant.

41:34.650 --> 41:37.448
We're also gonna keep everyone on payroll.
That way no one loses their job.

41:37.990 --> 41:39.571
Don't be a jackass, Danny.

41:39.830 --> 41:42.446
This isn't the way business gets done.
If your father were here...

41:42.620 --> 41:43.655
But he isn't.

41:44.540 --> 41:47.577
And as far as I can tell,
he's nowhere in this company.

41:47.920 --> 41:50.241
And believe me,
I've spent most of the clay looking.

41:51.630 --> 41:53.916
I know you all want me
to back out on this...

41:55.090 --> 41:56.216
but my dad once told me,

41:56.510 --> 42:00.719
"If something is worth fighting for,
you stand and you fight."

42:02.270 --> 42:03.259
So, I'm standing.

42:03.680 --> 42:06.558
Danny, you may have
a voice on this board,

42:07.350 --> 42:09.056
but it's just a courtesy.

42:09.360 --> 42:12.898
Don't expect anyone here
to be listening to a kid

42:13.070 --> 42:15.447
who got his MBA
from a Himalayan monastery.

42:15.610 --> 42:17.100
Lawrence,
you don't have to attack him.

42:18.450 --> 42:21.738
- Danny's plan is...
- The idiotic dream of a child.

42:24.750 --> 42:26.456
Karen Page at
The Bulletin
seemed to like it.

42:27.870 --> 42:30.247
What? You already went to the press?

42:30.710 --> 42:33.087
_ She seems to think
It's gonna make front page tomorrow.

42:35.550 --> 42:38.587
Listen. I know this isn't what you wanted.

42:39.180 --> 42:40.499
Any of you.

42:41.300 --> 42:44.713
But if you look deep down
at the better part of yourselves...

42:45.850 --> 42:48.091
you'll know we're
doing the right thing.

42:49.980 --> 42:51.811
Look, I'm sorry to cut this short,

42:51.980 --> 42:53.971
but there's somewhere else
I really need to be.

42:55.400 --> 42:58.699
Oh, uh, and the assistants
need their dental plan back,

42:58.950 --> 43:00.656
so we should
probably get on that, too.

43:05.000 --> 43:07.241
Shit. Incredible.

43:08.580 --> 43:09.990
Just incredible.

43:11.040 --> 43:13.201
Yeah, this image, the serpent,
do you know what it means?

43:20.220 --> 43:22.347
Did you know about the offices
on the 13th floor?

43:23.260 --> 43:25.592
Well, ifI had known,
I would have had Ward charge her rent.

43:28.180 --> 43:30.478
Hey, I've always been honest
with you, Danny. You know that.

43:32.730 --> 43:33.719
It's just...

43:35.610 --> 43:36.736
it's my father's name.

43:37.820 --> 43:38.809
It's my name.

43:41.280 --> 43:43.271
I can't believe the Hand's
been using it all this time.

43:43.450 --> 43:46.078
Yeah, well, that's why we're doing this.
Get 'em out of our company.

43:46.330 --> 43:48.036
Make Rand honest again.

43:48.790 --> 43:51.247
And you may have delivered
exactly what we need to get it done.

43:51.960 --> 43:54.747
Oh, it's everything about the Hand's
synthetic heroin operation.

43:54.920 --> 43:56.490
Their clients,
their shipping routes.

43:56.670 --> 43:59.503
And look, it's all going
through Rand Enterprises.

43:59.720 --> 44:02.541
This is why Gao's been keeping us
on such a short leash.

44:02.720 --> 44:04.597
She needs the company
for all this to work.

44:06.770 --> 44:08.385
Does it say where
she's making the heroin?

44:12.520 --> 44:13.976
Yeah, there's a warehouse
in Brooklyn.

44:14.650 --> 44:17.858
Gao's been running a lot of our trucks
through there in the past few days.

44:18.490 --> 44:20.731
It's possible this may be
the manufacturing plant.

44:21.740 --> 44:23.867
- That's where she'll be keeping Radovan.
- Who?

44:24.120 --> 44:26.406
He's the chemist.
The one who's making the heroin.

44:27.120 --> 44:28.109
I promised I would help him.

44:28.290 --> 44:31.578
Hey, you can't just go barging in there.
You'll be one man facing an army.

44:33.380 --> 44:36.747
- I can'tjust leave him.
- Hey, do the smart thing, Danny.

44:37.050 --> 44:39.757
_ Strike Gao down _
thIe you have the element of surprIse.

44:40.420 --> 44:43.753
Leave Radovan.
Look out for your own.

44:47.680 --> 44:49.307
I started this programme...

44:49.890 --> 44:51.801
to teach you not just how
to defend yourselves,

44:52.640 --> 44:54.392
but how to prepare for your futures.

44:55.230 --> 44:56.891
Today is Darryl's last day.

44:57.650 --> 44:59.777
He's bee_n_selected
for an eIIte traInIng programme

45:00.030 --> 45:02.237
that comes with a full scholarship
to a university.

45:02.700 --> 45:04.600
- You gonna miss me?
- Nah...

45:04.780 --> 45:06.566
Mostly.

45:08.790 --> 45:09.939
You deserve this.

45:10.620 --> 45:13.919
For your work ethic,
your commitment to the code,

45:14.330 --> 45:17.709
and most importantly, honouring
and protecting your fellow classmates.

45:26.390 --> 45:28.551
You're part of something
bigger than yourself now, Darryl.

45:29.430 --> 45:30.966
And that will make you stronger.

45:34.100 --> 45:36.682
A single arrow is easily broken...

45:38.270 --> 45:39.396
but not ten in a bundle.

45:52.580 --> 45:53.706
I came to warn you.

45:55.120 --> 45:56.576
The Hand knows who you are.

45:58.000 --> 45:59.126
Claire, too.

45:59.340 --> 46:00.625
I can handle myself.

46:01.840 --> 46:02.829
What about Radovan?

46:03.340 --> 46:04.375
I know where he is.

46:04.970 --> 46:07.086
Now I think I have a plan,
but it's dangerous.

46:07.260 --> 46:09.501
I don't care. Let's go get him.

46:09.680 --> 46:11.307
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

46:13.390 --> 46:17.099
Okay. But we gotta go. Now.

46:17.980 --> 46:20.972
- Go where?
- To get a bundle of arrows.

46:37.710 --> 46:38.699
Hello?

46:38.960 --> 46:41.952
Mr Meachum. This is Veronica
from Ambergris Caye.

46:42.340 --> 46:44.911
- There’s a problem with your reservation.
- What kind of problem?

46:45.920 --> 46:47.581
I’m afraid your card was declined.

46:50.970 --> 46:53.427
That's not possible. Run it again.

46:54.310 --> 46:56.551
We actually did sir. Twice.

46:59.190 --> 47:01.602
Just...
Hold on.

47:15.540 --> 47:16.746
Stop the car.

47:17.540 --> 47:19.417
You ’Ve refused to sell the Hand ’5 heroin.

47:20.710 --> 47:23.497
They've taken your pier,
butchered your men.

47:24.420 --> 47:25.796
They've given you two choices,

47:27.090 --> 47:28.751
serve or die.

47:29.930 --> 47:31.295
I'm here to give you a third.

47:33.180 --> 47:34.215
Join with us.

47:35.180 --> 47:37.011
We know where the heart
of their operation is.

47:38.020 --> 47:39.260
We attack together.

47:39.890 --> 47:41.221
Before they even
know what's hit 'em,

47:41.560 --> 47:43.937
we can_end the Hand's_
herom busmess In one strIke.

47:46.730 --> 47:48.891
You can fight. I'll give you that.

47:50.450 --> 47:51.940
But the Hand is legion.

47:53.030 --> 47:54.406
Why attack now?

47:55.580 --> 47:58.401
Why do you think you can
even the odds against our enemies?

48:01.790 --> 48:04.281
Because I have heard
Madame Gao's plans for you.

48:05.840 --> 48:09.469
And if you do nothing,
you'll all be dead by the end of the week.

48:11.220 --> 48:14.292
You don't know me...
but the Hand does.

48:15.470 --> 48:16.550
And they fear me.

48:18.020 --> 48:21.057
With you and your
men by our side...

48:23.100 --> 48:24.260
they'll fear you, too.

48:32.360 --> 48:33.440
Lawrence.

48:33.740 --> 48:37.039
I was just reading some of the press
on the closure. It's good.

48:37.950 --> 48:39.611
Danny might actually be onto...

48:43.670 --> 48:44.659
What's going on?

48:46.090 --> 48:48.627
The board just held
an emergency meeting.

48:49.550 --> 48:50.539
About what?

48:51.170 --> 48:56.255
About how you, your brother, and Danny
will no longer be on the board...

48:56.890 --> 48:59.381
or any part of this company ever again.

49:01.060 --> 49:02.687
You've been ousted from Rand.

49:57.320 --> 49:59.117
Oh, no...

50:01.490 --> 50:03.287
Radovan. Radovan!

50:05.960 --> 50:07.245
Sabina...

50:07.500 --> 50:10.162
Sabina's fine. She's home.

50:11.340 --> 50:12.910
She's safe.

50:16.680 --> 50:18.170
We're gonna get you out of here.

50:26.440 --> 50:27.589
Where's Madame Gao?

50:32.820 --> 50:34.560
You must forgive me.

50:36.360 --> 50:37.736
I told her.

50:39.120 --> 50:41.691
I told her how to
make the heroin.

50:44.540 --> 50:45.655
Where did she go?

50:48.000 --> 50:51.083
Radovan, please.
Where is she?

50:54.420 --> 50:55.626
Anzhou...

51:03.350 --> 51:04.339
Radovan.

51:08.480 --> 51:10.186
Oh, Danny.

51:14.360 --> 51:15.349
Danny?

51:16.530 --> 51:17.736
Anzhou...

51:21.660 --> 51:23.230
It's the name of a city in China.

51:25.370 --> 51:26.496
Have you been there?

51:28.460 --> 51:31.623
I would have, 15 years ago,
if my plane hadn't crashed.

51:36.880 --> 51:38.416
It's where my
father was taking us.

51:59.150 --> 52:01.402
Oh, Ward, I thought
you might be stopping by.

52:01.780 --> 52:02.815
How did you know?

52:04.240 --> 52:07.243
How did you know

52:07.410 --> 52:09.571
- about the account?
- I always knew.

52:10.620 --> 52:13.168
Did you really think it was that easy
to steal millions of dollars

52:13.330 --> 52:14.706
from the company
and not get caught?

52:15.210 --> 52:17.087
Come on, I thought I raised you
smarter than that.

52:19.920 --> 52:22.047
Who do you think's been keeping
your transactions hidden

52:22.220 --> 52:24.427
from the accountants?
Or the SEC?

52:26.060 --> 52:29.018
Stick with business, son.
You're a shitty thief.

52:32.940 --> 52:33.975
Why?

52:36.940 --> 52:39.067
Why would you let me think
I was getting away with it?

52:39.780 --> 52:42.852
Oh, well, we all have our private vices.
Yours just happened to be embezzling.

52:44.370 --> 52:46.827
And as long as your hobby
didn't interfere with our work...

52:47.540 --> 52:48.609
who was I to judge?

52:50.410 --> 52:54.119
But honestly, Ward,
couldn't you have just gotten a mistress?

52:54.920 --> 52:55.989
Much simpler.

52:56.170 --> 53:00.960
I am sick of it!
The control, the manipulation...

53:01.130 --> 53:02.290
Yeah, I know you're upset.

53:02.470 --> 53:04.961
You don't see it now,
but I had to stop you from leaving.

53:05.640 --> 53:08.256
You were making
the biggest mistake of your life.

53:08.430 --> 53:10.091
That was my money!

53:10.270 --> 53:12.977
Well, technically, it was
the employee pension fund's money.

53:14.190 --> 53:16.260
I was gonna be free.

53:16.480 --> 53:18.220
Yeah, we're all gonna be free, Ward.

53:18.690 --> 53:21.147
We are so close to being
done with the Hand.

53:21.820 --> 53:24.778
Now, if you had run away,
run away like a scared child,

53:24.990 --> 53:27.572
you would have regretted it
every day for the rest of your life.

53:27.830 --> 53:29.286
Now, relax.

53:29.870 --> 53:31.406
You just had a moment of weakness.

53:32.870 --> 53:36.328
It happens.
I'm not gonna punish you for it.

53:39.000 --> 53:41.958
I'm not a child
and I'm not scared.

53:42.130 --> 53:43.506
Well, then stop acting like one.

53:44.550 --> 53:47.542
Today's a good day.
You should be happy.

53:50.890 --> 53:54.348
You know what the last happy day
of my life was, Dad?

53:56.150 --> 53:57.606
The day you died.

54:05.110 --> 54:06.407
That's just mean, Ward.

54:13.620 --> 54:16.418
You should be grateful. Yeah.

54:16.620 --> 54:19.623
You wouldn't have a life without me.
I've given you everything.

54:19.920 --> 54:23.504
I've shown you how to run the company,
how to be respected, how to be feared.

54:24.380 --> 54:26.007
All you had to do was listen.

54:27.130 --> 54:29.212
You're my creation.
You belong to me.

54:30.390 --> 54:31.596
Don't ever forget it.

54:38.440 --> 54:40.351
Ah, you really should
take a look at this, Ward.

54:41.070 --> 54:42.435
Danny took it off Gao.

54:43.190 --> 54:45.181
Genius_ how the Hand's
been usmg our company.

54:45.400 --> 54:49.404
Well, not just us, it's everywhere.
It's, like, Roxxon, Midland Circle...

54:50.780 --> 54:53.362
Yeah. You could really
learn something from them

54:53.540 --> 54:56.031
for_the next_ time_ _
you feel lIke steaIIng mIIIIons.

55:08.930 --> 55:10.295
Huh? Huh?
