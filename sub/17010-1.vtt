01:26.880 --> 01:32.359
(BREATHES DEEPLY)

01:52.800 --> 01:54.879
You deserve this...

01:55.040 --> 01:57.679
You do.

01:57.840 --> 02:00.239
You've earned it.

02:12.920 --> 02:15.079
(GROANS)

03:16.040 --> 03:20.239
I can do all things. All things.

03:36.880 --> 03:38.279
Come on...

03:38.440 --> 03:41.719
Come on, come on...

05:54.480 --> 05:56.239
(FOOTSTEPS)

06:14.160 --> 06:16.839
I am the Invigilator.

06:17.000 --> 06:18.959
Listen carefully
to every word I say.

06:19.120 --> 06:21.919
There will be no repetition.

06:22.080 --> 06:26.039
I won't apologise for the hardships
you've endured reaching this room

06:26.200 --> 06:29.679
'cause the pressures
and pains were necessary.

06:29.840 --> 06:32.759
Resilience is a key
attribute in these dark times,

06:32.920 --> 06:37.439
and if you can't survive our selection
process, you won't survive in the job.

06:37.600 --> 06:41.439
Many highly-qualified
candidates tried to get this far and failed.

06:41.600 --> 06:44.319
You have succeeded.

06:44.480 --> 06:46.599
And now the final stage lies before you.

06:46.920 --> 06:50.319
One last hurdle
separates you from your goal -

06:50.480 --> 06:52.839
which is to join our esteemed ranks.

06:53.000 --> 06:55.879
The test is simple
in comparison, yet it will determine

06:56.040 --> 06:59.399
who leaves this room
with a contract of employment

06:59.560 --> 07:03.479
and who leaves
with the bus fare home.

07:04.960 --> 07:07.999
Through these trials,
you've gained some idea of the power

07:08.160 --> 07:10.919
of this organisation,
so believe me when I tell you

07:11.080 --> 07:14.959
that there's no law
in this room but our law.

07:15.360 --> 07:19.359
And the only rules
in here are our rules.

07:21.600 --> 07:25.119
There's one question before you,
and one answer is required.

07:25.280 --> 07:28.239
If you try
to communicate with myself

07:28.400 --> 07:32.159
or the guard,
you will be disqualified.

07:32.320 --> 07:36.799
If you spoil your paper,
intentionally or accidentally,

07:36.960 --> 07:39.079
you will be disqualified.

07:39.240 --> 07:42.959
If you choose
to leave the room for any reason,

07:43.120 --> 07:45.159
you will be disqualified.

07:47.000 --> 07:48.719
Any questions?

07:51.680 --> 07:54.479
Best of luck, ladies and gentlemen.

07:56.920 --> 08:00.079
We're giving the eight of you
80 minutes.

08:01.880 --> 08:06.639
80 minutes to convince us
you have what it takes to join us.

08:06.800 --> 08:11.159
80 minutes to determine
the next 80 years of your lives.

08:13.080 --> 08:15.279
Begin.

10:02.440 --> 10:05.239
I'm not finished.

10:05.400 --> 10:09.839
No, please. You can't!
This isn't a proper test!

10:10.000 --> 10:13.319
Please, I'll start over!
Just give me a chance!

10:13.480 --> 10:16.119
(SHE CRIES)

10:16.280 --> 10:19.959
(SPEAKS lN CANTONESE)

11:33.680 --> 11:35.959
Hey...

11:36.120 --> 11:37.959
Listen, listen, listen, listen.

11:41.920 --> 11:45.799
It's not about what he said,
you know.

11:45.960 --> 11:48.559
It's what he didn't say.

11:52.560 --> 11:54.959
"lf you attempt to communicate..."

11:55.120 --> 11:57.599
..with myself or the guard...

11:57.760 --> 11:59.959
..you will be disqualified.

12:04.400 --> 12:07.479
- He didn't say...
- ..we can't speak to each other.

12:09.680 --> 12:14.719
- Now you're talking.
- Is this the ultimate mind-fuck or what?

12:22.960 --> 12:26.319
- Has anyone figured out the answer?
- No.

12:26.480 --> 12:28.839
It's not about the answer.
It's about the question.

12:29.000 --> 12:33.039
- What's the question?
- We've got 74 minutes left to figure out.

12:33.200 --> 12:35.679
(WOMAN) If the answer
takes one minute to write down.

12:35.840 --> 12:37.519
If it takes 73 minutes to write,

12:37.680 --> 12:40.919
we have one minute
to guess the question.

12:41.080 --> 12:44.399
We're short on writing space.
I'm betting it's the former.

12:44.560 --> 12:46.999
We've gotta help each other.

12:47.160 --> 12:50.999
We're in competition.
Why should I help you to beat me?

12:51.160 --> 12:54.519
We may be in competition
to answer the question,

12:54.680 --> 12:58.159
but to establish the question
we have to cooperate.

12:58.320 --> 13:00.279
They expect us to cooperate, don't they?

13:00.440 --> 13:02.759
What'd you expect,
you're gonna win this job,

13:02.920 --> 13:06.279
with all the rewards that come with it,

13:06.440 --> 13:08.959
by giving them
a little simple written answer?

13:09.120 --> 13:11.839
Facts and opinions?
Compare and contrast (!)

13:12.000 --> 13:14.639
They're not looking for that.

13:14.800 --> 13:18.479
A job like this needs initiative,

13:18.640 --> 13:20.559
observation...

13:22.840 --> 13:24.519
..interplay.

13:24.680 --> 13:29.719
- Teamwork. He's right.
- (WOMAN) We're in a stress scenario.

13:29.880 --> 13:33.199
A confusing, time-critical situation

13:33.360 --> 13:37.079
designed to test our intelligence,
and resilience.

13:37.240 --> 13:40.719
- To bring out the worst in us.
- (MAN) Or the best.

13:42.400 --> 13:44.999
We help each other until
the playing field is open

13:45.160 --> 13:48.719
then it's every man for themselves -
no offence, girls.

13:51.640 --> 13:54.159
- Are we all agreed?
- Yes.

13:54.320 --> 13:56.919
Agreed.

14:00.920 --> 14:05.359
- Let's go, Gandhi.
- My name isn't Gandhi, friend. It's...

14:05.520 --> 14:09.959
No names. Not real ones, anyway.
They're not written on this for a reason.

14:10.920 --> 14:12.719
We'll use nicknames, then.

14:14.160 --> 14:19.079
- All right, let's make this easy.
- We already have numbers.

14:19.240 --> 14:21.119
Yeah, and visual.

14:25.640 --> 14:27.759
You're Black.

14:29.200 --> 14:31.079
I'm White.

14:31.240 --> 14:33.359
You're Brown.

14:35.160 --> 14:37.039
We've got Blonde here,

14:37.200 --> 14:39.719
Brunette there...

14:42.120 --> 14:44.279
..Dark, I suppose.

14:46.720 --> 14:48.999
And last
as well as least we've got Deaf.

14:56.360 --> 14:59.759
- Tough last round.
- Yeah, whatever.

15:02.280 --> 15:04.119
Any objections?

15:04.280 --> 15:08.079
Apart from your grossly insensitive
sexual and racial stereotyping?

15:08.240 --> 15:10.759
If you're the sensitive type,
you shouldn't be here, love.

15:10.920 --> 15:13.079
I'll take Brown over Gandhi,

15:13.240 --> 15:16.679
we're talking about
something that matters.

15:17.640 --> 15:19.439
I'll take that as a yes.

15:23.960 --> 15:25.759
(SlGHS DEEPLY)

15:30.920 --> 15:33.559
So, what else hasn't he forbidden?

15:37.440 --> 15:40.679
He hasn't forbidden
us to stand, has he?

16:08.880 --> 16:14.159
- Well, l guess moving about is OK too.
- What's that gonna achieve?

16:14.320 --> 16:17.719
I don't know, Brown. But sitting
wasn't getting us anywhere exciting.

16:17.880 --> 16:21.799
What if the question is written down
but we just can't see it?

16:21.960 --> 16:24.039
That's what l'm talking about!

16:24.200 --> 16:27.719
- You mean like invisible ink?
- Or a watermark.

16:27.880 --> 16:31.199
- It's possible.
- It's probable. Where else would it be?

16:31.360 --> 16:35.599
(BRUNETTE) We'd need something
to reveal it. Like light.

16:42.480 --> 16:47.879
- Right.
- Those are halogen.

16:48.040 --> 16:50.839
Those aren't.

16:53.280 --> 16:56.119
They won't bite, you know.

17:06.079 --> 17:08.598
They're not gonna make it
that easy, are they?

17:08.760 --> 17:11.919
We're on the clock.
How hard can they afford to make it?

17:15.160 --> 17:19.319
What if the pencil
isn't just for writing the answer?

17:19.480 --> 17:23.999
What if it reveals the question too?
By shading the page, like tracing paper?

17:25.000 --> 17:29.039
- Try it, Blonde.
- No. Remember what he said.

17:29.200 --> 17:32.679
If you spoil your paper,
intentionally or accidentally...

17:32.840 --> 17:35.519
..you'll be disqualified.

17:35.680 --> 17:41.319
Is anyone certain they know
what his definition of spoiling is?

17:41.480 --> 17:44.759
Look, let's crack this.
Throw out some ideas.

17:44.920 --> 17:47.959
What if the questions are hidden
in the paper,

17:48.120 --> 17:51.719
but each of us has to write
a different answer? He said...

17:51.880 --> 17:55.639
There's one question before you,
and one answer is required.

17:55.800 --> 17:58.719
That doesn't mean it's
the same question for each of us.

17:58.880 --> 18:01.639
There could be eight different
questions and answers.

18:01.800 --> 18:05.079
If we find one question,
we can find them all.

18:05.240 --> 18:08.559
Not necessarily.
Not if our eight individual questions

18:08.720 --> 18:11.799
can only be revealed
using eight different methods.

18:11.960 --> 18:13.839
Perhaps we're not
meant to cooperate at all.

18:14.000 --> 18:15.439
I like that idea.

18:15.600 --> 18:18.519
Or there's only one question,
printed on only one of our sheets.

18:18.680 --> 18:22.359
- Then we'd need to cooperate...
- Time-out for some testing.

18:24.120 --> 18:27.559
- Everyone up to the light.
- I said it won't be that easy.

18:27.720 --> 18:30.639
Unless you want to make a list
of our brainwaves, White,

18:30.800 --> 18:33.399
I say we cross a few off as we go.

18:35.480 --> 18:37.039
Fine.

19:01.960 --> 19:04.519
(WHITE) Allow me.

19:12.760 --> 19:15.039
Thank you.

19:21.920 --> 19:23.919
Yeah, join in any time, Deaf (!)

19:32.000 --> 19:34.119
Not one for small talk, are you?

19:34.280 --> 19:35.759
Come.

19:38.160 --> 19:40.199
Relax, you'll get it back (!)

19:48.960 --> 19:54.399
Like l said, l think we can
strike light off the list.

19:58.480 --> 20:01.719
Light is a spectrum.

20:01.880 --> 20:03.919
There's light we can see,

20:04.080 --> 20:06.519
but there's light we can't see.

20:06.680 --> 20:09.639
Like ultraviolet, infra-red, X-rays.

20:09.800 --> 20:12.479
If we can't see it,
how are we supposed to find it?

20:12.640 --> 20:16.199
The source must be visible,
even if the light isn't. Right?

20:17.880 --> 20:20.799
(SlGHS DEEPLY)

20:43.920 --> 20:45.919
Find the light switches.

20:53.840 --> 20:57.159
There aren't any,
not in here anyway. And...

20:57.320 --> 20:59.879
If you choose to leave
the room for any reason...

21:00.040 --> 21:01.359
..we'll be disqualified.

21:03.560 --> 21:05.959
There must be some way
to trigger these.

21:09.520 --> 21:11.519
This is emergency lighting.

21:11.680 --> 21:13.799
So let's create an emergency.

21:15.480 --> 21:17.599
That would be very risky.

21:17.760 --> 21:20.919
- It's less risky than doing nothing.
- He's right.

21:21.080 --> 21:25.999
If we try this and fail,
we can't go back. Blackout.

21:31.640 --> 21:33.479
We vote.

22:02.800 --> 22:05.279
Those too.

22:33.400 --> 22:36.279
Nice! Very nice!

22:36.440 --> 22:38.439
Touch of blue, what you wanted?

22:38.600 --> 22:40.399
This is black light.

22:40.560 --> 22:43.919
The kind credit card firms
use to reveal their security symbols.

22:53.240 --> 22:55.919
(WHITE) Shame we didn't apply
to work for Visa (!)

22:56.080 --> 22:59.799
- Our gamble might have paid off.
- (BROWN) lt did pay off.

22:59.960 --> 23:03.239
Just not in the way you wanted.

23:03.400 --> 23:06.599
You acted, and the room reacted.

23:06.760 --> 23:10.999
We've entered a dialogue now,
we should keep going.

23:11.160 --> 23:14.079
Yeah, maybe... Maybe not.

23:17.000 --> 23:20.479
Sorry, it was invisible
light you said you wanted.

23:20.640 --> 23:22.879
This looks pretty
fucking visible to me.

23:23.040 --> 23:26.959
Scientific term for it
is "near-ultraviolet".

23:27.120 --> 23:29.919
It didn't work,
but it was worth trying.

23:32.120 --> 23:35.159
If nothing else we'll
come out of this with great tans.

23:37.440 --> 23:39.439
We've got to knock these out too.

23:41.160 --> 23:43.879
The top halves
of these strips aren't lit.

23:44.040 --> 23:47.199
Look.

24:10.800 --> 24:13.519
Infrared. The other option.

24:13.680 --> 24:17.599
- That exposes something too?
- It's less common than UV, but yes.

24:18.800 --> 24:21.239
Art historians use it
to make reflectograms

24:21.400 --> 24:24.199
of the sketch outlines
beneath paintings.

24:24.360 --> 24:27.719
If there's a hidden
layer in our papers...

24:34.680 --> 24:37.559
Carefully.

25:04.000 --> 25:05.799
Let me guess, "near-infrared"?

25:07.000 --> 25:09.119
All right, everyone, try again.

25:18.520 --> 25:22.079
- Anyone? Anything?
- (DARK) No.

25:22.240 --> 25:25.399
- (BRUNETTE) Shit!
- (GRUNTS)

25:28.240 --> 25:32.399
- Now can we get off the lighting?
- If you can provide a better alternative.

25:32.560 --> 25:35.879
Any alternative. We've burned
a quarter of our time already.

25:37.960 --> 25:41.639
Perhaps they company's Japanese-owned
and this is an origami exam.

25:41.800 --> 25:44.319
Be our guest.
That sheet is yours to spoil.

25:48.360 --> 25:53.279
Yes, it is, but only your sheet.

26:02.480 --> 26:06.039
- It's a piece of paper.
- No, it's more than that now.

26:06.200 --> 26:09.279
This is experimental material.

26:09.440 --> 26:11.719
- If you spoil...
- ..your paper.

26:11.880 --> 26:15.639
- Your paper!
- ..you will be disqualified.

26:15.800 --> 26:17.399
This isn't mine. This is hers.

26:17.560 --> 26:19.959
(lN HIGH-PlTCHED VOlCE)
"It's not fair" (!)

26:20.120 --> 26:23.079
And she's gone. So...

26:29.040 --> 26:36.319
Tracing...

26:40.640 --> 26:44.199
Well, congratulations, Blonde.
Your idea sucks too.

26:44.360 --> 26:46.999
This could all be
a distraction, you know.

26:47.160 --> 26:49.119
We could be missing
something obvious.

26:49.280 --> 26:51.159
Yeah, yeah, yeah! All right!

26:51.320 --> 26:56.559
Light does not work,
lead does not work...

26:57.880 --> 26:59.679
Liquid!

27:01.400 --> 27:03.799
Oh, yeah...

27:08.960 --> 27:11.679
Right.

27:11.840 --> 27:14.439
Lick it, spit on it, get it wet.

27:14.600 --> 27:18.079
If the question's watermarked
we need some liquid to bring it out.

27:18.240 --> 27:20.919
- (BLACK) What are you doing with yours?
- You don't wanna know.

27:21.080 --> 27:23.799
- Actually, we do.
- Well, you can come and watch.

27:23.960 --> 27:26.119
You can hold it for me
too if you like.

27:26.280 --> 27:30.159
- Though I'd prefer it if Blonde did.
- (BLACK) That's disgusting.

27:30.320 --> 27:33.159
"By any means necessary",
right, brother?

27:33.320 --> 27:35.519
- If we can do it, we should.
- (URlNATES)

27:35.680 --> 27:39.719
That's not gonna burn the question out.
Urine's sterile. You can drink it...

27:39.880 --> 27:44.479
- (TO HIMSELF) Wish you would.
- Great. A pissing contest.

27:51.840 --> 27:53.839
(BLACK) Anything?

27:55.240 --> 27:59.559
- I can't tell yet. lt's all yellow.
- (BLACK) Hold it up and let us see.

27:59.720 --> 28:01.839
If you'll lend me a glove, l'll oblige.

28:03.160 --> 28:05.119
Well, l'm running out of ideas.

28:12.560 --> 28:15.639
Giving up so easily, Black,
with 57 minutes on the clock?

28:15.800 --> 28:17.279
You know what...

28:17.440 --> 28:20.999
Will you two shut up?
Some of us are trying to think!

28:23.560 --> 28:27.479
(GASPlNG)

28:32.760 --> 28:35.079
At last, he speaks.

28:40.200 --> 28:44.479
(DARK) He's French.

28:44.640 --> 28:48.279
- (DEAF) Vous voyez la?
- Does anyone here speak French?

28:48.440 --> 28:50.119
Vous voyez la?

28:52.760 --> 28:54.759
Can you see?

28:54.920 --> 28:57.719
Vous voyez...?

29:01.120 --> 29:03.439
Regardez bien.

29:03.600 --> 29:08.519
- Can you see it in there?
- See what in there?

29:08.680 --> 29:12.479
See what? Pretty colours?

29:12.640 --> 29:15.999
- Vous-meme.
- Yourself.

29:17.040 --> 29:19.039
Vous vous voyez.

29:21.080 --> 29:23.679
It shows you yourself.

29:28.520 --> 29:31.999
- And then there was six.
- Leave him alone. He's done nothing.

29:32.160 --> 29:35.399
He's done nothing for me either
or any of us. Nutter!

29:37.320 --> 29:41.519
Toujours y voir clairement est primordial.

29:41.680 --> 29:43.199
To see clearly is all.

29:43.360 --> 29:46.279
All right, that's enough
out of you, Sartre!

29:49.600 --> 29:51.479
Fucking philosophers.

29:53.280 --> 29:57.399
Thank God this world
belongs to the doers, not the thinkers.

29:58.800 --> 30:02.359
Since we're proposing grand theories,
let me advance one of my own.

30:04.080 --> 30:07.319
This is not an exam.

30:08.640 --> 30:10.719
Not in the conventional sense anyway.

30:10.880 --> 30:13.359
Look around.

30:13.520 --> 30:15.959
You couldn't ask for a more
representative group

30:16.120 --> 30:18.879
to qualify for the final stage.

30:19.280 --> 30:22.239
Four men and four women
entered this room,

30:22.400 --> 30:25.319
all from differing cultures
and ethnic backgrounds,

30:25.480 --> 30:28.439
possessing a healthy mixture
of skill-sets.

30:28.600 --> 30:32.039
How convenient that is. How staged.

30:32.200 --> 30:37.039
What are you saying? They rigged
the tests to bring us together?

30:37.200 --> 30:39.879
Some kind of experiment
in group dynamics.

30:40.040 --> 30:44.559
- What are you on about?
- I'm saying this is a game.

30:44.720 --> 30:48.319
- And they're betting on us.
- Right and who is "they"?

30:49.320 --> 30:51.479
The board.

30:56.880 --> 30:59.399
I guess they're watching us right now.

31:02.600 --> 31:05.999
They'll be ex-VCs mostly.

31:06.160 --> 31:08.639
Probably left
the incubator when they realised

31:08.800 --> 31:11.679
their little start-up
had struck the motherlode.

31:11.840 --> 31:14.559
It wouldn't get any sweeter
than this, l'm sure.

31:14.720 --> 31:17.719
So they joined the board,

31:17.880 --> 31:19.959
secured some big fat stock options

31:20.120 --> 31:23.599
and bought themselves
the right to have a little fun...

31:23.760 --> 31:25.719
With us.

31:25.880 --> 31:28.759
Don't they have better things to do
with their time?

31:31.120 --> 31:33.439
Like what?

31:33.600 --> 31:36.719
At their level, money ceases
to be the prime motivator.

31:36.880 --> 31:38.879
It's risk they live for.

31:39.040 --> 31:41.239
They're type A's, like us,

31:41.400 --> 31:44.559
and just as they were trained
by their investment companies,

31:44.720 --> 31:47.639
they're still betting on ideas today.

31:47.800 --> 31:51.199
Ours.

31:51.360 --> 31:55.719
Who'll decipher the question,
who'll come up empty and fold

31:55.880 --> 31:59.279
and who'll crack under pressure?

32:02.160 --> 32:03.479
You could be wrong.

32:03.640 --> 32:06.359
It could just be
the Invigilator behind there.

32:06.520 --> 32:09.079
Wanna bet?

32:10.360 --> 32:12.279
(DARK) l wouldn't, if l were you.

32:12.440 --> 32:15.679
Brown talks like a gambler
because he is one.

32:15.840 --> 32:18.879
A professional. Aren't you?

32:21.240 --> 32:24.879
And you, Dark, are a shrink.

32:29.400 --> 32:33.839
Psychologist or psychiatrist?
I forget the difference.

32:34.000 --> 32:36.319
Psychiatrists dispense drugs
to control mood.

32:36.480 --> 32:38.839
I'm a qualified student
of human behaviour.

32:39.000 --> 32:41.639
Then you should know
what I'm talking about.

32:41.800 --> 32:46.679
The point of having power
is to exercise it in all its forms.

32:46.840 --> 32:50.279
- We're pawns of the Gods in here.
- So? This changes nothing!

32:50.440 --> 32:51.759
(BLACK) Yeah...

32:51.920 --> 32:55.559
Games are played to be won...
as a team.

32:55.720 --> 32:57.999
Yeah, or as individuals.

32:58.160 --> 33:01.319
Not if the only way for them
to win is for us to lose.

33:01.480 --> 33:04.439
All of us.
Have you thought about that?

33:07.080 --> 33:08.839
You're wrong.

33:09.000 --> 33:11.359
There is no 'them' watching us.

33:11.520 --> 33:14.359
The CEO is hands-on.

33:14.520 --> 33:17.959
He micro-manages anything
of importance to his company.

33:18.120 --> 33:21.679
And this is no ordinary
selection process.

33:21.840 --> 33:24.759
We're special.

33:24.920 --> 33:28.999
If anyone's back there
besides the lnvigilator, it's him.

33:29.160 --> 33:33.279
Everyone else is a secretary
in his structure - even board members.

33:33.440 --> 33:36.399
That's how he likes it.

33:38.280 --> 33:40.039
How do you know all this?

33:40.520 --> 33:42.079
We're wasting time.

33:42.240 --> 33:44.999
There's 50 minutes left,
we're no closer to finding the question.

33:45.160 --> 33:49.039
Somehow l suspect
my question relates to the question.

33:49.200 --> 33:51.919
So answer me.

33:52.080 --> 33:56.719
- How did you learn that information?
- Same way you learned about the board.

33:56.880 --> 34:00.519
I don't know anything about the board.
I made an educated guess.

34:00.680 --> 34:04.359
But you...you know who the CEO is
and what he's like. How come?

34:04.520 --> 34:08.239
- How come you don't?
- How could we? We were headhunted.

34:10.040 --> 34:12.958
- Why? Weren't you?
- Of course not!

34:13.120 --> 34:17.719
I heard there was a vacancy and applied.
I thought we all did!

34:18.280 --> 34:21.399
Are you saying you wanna work
for this company,

34:21.560 --> 34:26.518
jumped through every hoop to get here
but you don't know who they are?

34:26.679 --> 34:30.759
They listed salary and benefits.
The job description detailed,

34:30.920 --> 34:34.079
"A high level of responsibility
in a Fortune 500 company

34:34.239 --> 34:39.239
manufacturing state-of-the-art technology
in a core service industry". All right?

34:39.400 --> 34:42.998
- You didn't wanna know anymore?
- The deal was no questions asked.

34:43.159 --> 34:46.199
Anyone would've done
the same in our position...

34:46.360 --> 34:48.679
Anyone with...balls.

34:52.159 --> 34:54.438
- You all applied?
- Yeah.

34:56.159 --> 34:59.319
If this job is so prestigious,
why they need to advertise?

34:59.480 --> 35:02.279
- They didn't.
- We have our sources.

35:02.440 --> 35:06.199
- Looks like we're outnumbered.
- I wouldn't cry about it.

35:06.360 --> 35:08.919
- You've the edge over us now.
- How's that?

35:09.080 --> 35:12.079
You're wanted, aren't you?
They invited you to apply.

35:13.880 --> 35:17.719
I'd say we're disadvantaged because
you showed the initiative to apply.

35:17.880 --> 35:19.879
We're behind the curve now.

35:20.040 --> 35:25.759
So tell us what you know,
starting with a complete job description.

35:25.920 --> 35:28.999
- We don't have that information.
- Should we believe that?

35:29.160 --> 35:31.439
(BLACK)
We don't know any more about the job.

35:31.600 --> 35:34.199
We just know about the company
and, believe me,

35:34.360 --> 35:37.959
the worst job with them
beats the best anyone else can offer.

35:38.120 --> 35:43.039
He's right. Who they are,
who the CEO is and what he's achieved,

35:43.200 --> 35:45.399
that's all you need to know.

35:45.560 --> 35:47.279
All right, so tell us about it.

35:50.720 --> 35:52.959
I'll give you a clue.

35:53.120 --> 35:56.479
1 0 years ago a lot of healthy
young people around the world

35:56.640 --> 35:59.039
got sick and started dying.

35:59.200 --> 36:00.879
You may have read about that.

36:01.040 --> 36:05.199
Then a medical researcher
patented a virus suppressant.

36:05.360 --> 36:07.999
The mortality rate
halved in six months,

36:08.160 --> 36:10.639
and now his company
is the biggest player

36:10.800 --> 36:14.199
in the global health industry
with a turnover of $20 billion

36:14.360 --> 36:17.679
and a market
capitalisation of $60 billion.

36:17.840 --> 36:19.199
If it was a nation state,

36:19.360 --> 36:22.719
it would rank as
the world's eighth largest economy.

36:22.880 --> 36:24.919
Next year that rises to sixth.

36:25.920 --> 36:27.799
You may have read about that too.

36:29.720 --> 36:31.719
Biorg!

36:31.880 --> 36:33.479
(DARK) 80 minutes...

36:33.640 --> 36:36.439
..to determine the next
80 years of your lives.

36:36.600 --> 36:37.879
Remember?

36:38.040 --> 36:40.479
Longevity is what they do.

36:40.640 --> 36:46.159
Antisense drugs, gene therapy,
microsurgical applications.

36:46.320 --> 36:49.799
They announced a hiring freeze
last year! Everyone knows that.

36:49.960 --> 36:55.919
Publicly that's true.
Privately...they're expanding again.

36:57.320 --> 37:00.119
Gearing up for a big push of some kind.

37:02.240 --> 37:04.319
They've found a cure.

37:04.480 --> 37:06.639
They must have!

37:06.800 --> 37:09.559
Manufacturing and marketing

37:09.720 --> 37:13.199
would triple in size for the roll-out.

37:14.440 --> 37:17.559
There'd be jobs for all of us!

37:17.720 --> 37:21.559
- We don't know that.
- But it's possible, isn't it?

37:23.240 --> 37:26.759
How long would
FDA approval take, if it's true?

37:26.920 --> 37:30.399
- That's not my field.
- Hold on.

37:30.560 --> 37:34.199
Why are you so interested?
Something you want to tell us?

37:34.360 --> 37:37.879
If you're asking "Am I infected?",
White, the answer is "No".

37:38.040 --> 37:41.999
- I'm clean.
- But someone you know isn't.

37:42.160 --> 37:45.719
We all know someone with the virus,
that's why they call it a pandemic.

37:45.880 --> 37:50.359
Nice evasive manoeuvre, but we're talking
about the real reason you're here.

37:52.040 --> 37:54.519
Yeah...
So, what relative is it?

37:54.680 --> 37:59.239
Is it your mum? Your dad?
Little sister...

37:59.400 --> 38:02.079
It's my partner, OK?
He can't afford suppressants,

38:02.240 --> 38:05.479
but they're discounted to employees -
are you happy now?

38:07.840 --> 38:09.919
So who else is a charity case here?

38:13.320 --> 38:15.879
Yeah, you wouldn't speak up, if you were.

38:16.040 --> 38:19.639
Don't want to commit career suicide
on camera like she just has.

38:19.800 --> 38:21.759
(BLACK) With a little help from you.

38:21.920 --> 38:24.319
I didn't create her situation,
I just exposed it.

38:24.480 --> 38:29.079
(BLACK) Doesn't matter. lf she gets
the answer right, she's still hired.

38:29.240 --> 38:32.279
Really? Says who?
What...them?

38:34.280 --> 38:39.119
- If memory serves me correct...
- The only rules in here are our rules.

38:39.280 --> 38:42.079
They can disqualify everyone!

38:42.240 --> 38:45.599
They can do whatever they like
and we can't do a thing about it.

38:45.760 --> 38:47.759
So...congratulations!

38:47.920 --> 38:51.119
You've just disqualified yourself
without breaking any rules.

38:51.280 --> 38:54.799
He won't kick you out,
but you're dead in the water, honey.

38:56.280 --> 38:58.279
Dead in the water.

38:59.120 --> 39:01.679
Don't listen to him.
We'll get through this together.

39:01.840 --> 39:04.119
Thanks, but I don't need your help,

39:04.280 --> 39:08.519
because my situation
isn't a weakness, it's a strength.

39:10.880 --> 39:13.799
I'm sure they're
smart enough to realise that.

39:13.960 --> 39:17.079
And if l could talk to the CEO

39:17.240 --> 39:21.239
I'd assure him the treatment my partner
needs will only deepen my commitment

39:21.400 --> 39:24.719
to his organisation for years to come.

39:28.560 --> 39:30.559
You really think he's behind there?

39:30.720 --> 39:33.359
He's lived behind walls for years.

39:33.520 --> 39:37.319
No one outside his inner circle
has even seen him since the lPO.

39:38.640 --> 39:41.199
If he wanted to hire an assistant,

39:41.360 --> 39:43.799
this is the way he'd do it.

39:57.880 --> 39:59.639
What are you doing?

39:59.800 --> 40:03.119
Proving my worth. You may have
run out of ideas, but I haven't.

40:03.280 --> 40:07.759
- Don't even try talking to him.
- I'm not gonna talk to him.

40:17.720 --> 40:20.199
Is there anything in there,
or is he happy to see you?

40:42.960 --> 40:45.599
What have we here?

40:49.200 --> 40:51.119
Is that all?

40:55.800 --> 40:57.119
Heat may have an effect

40:57.280 --> 40:59.919
if the papers have been
chemically treated.

41:00.080 --> 41:04.639
- If we warmed them from beneath...
- It's not heat and chemicals, Black.

41:06.200 --> 41:07.999
It's just chemicals.

41:11.000 --> 41:14.479
What are you talking about? H2O?

41:16.200 --> 41:19.159
We already tried H2O!
It's in all our bodily fluids!

41:19.320 --> 41:24.239
What are these pipes connected to?
You could pump any liquid through them!

41:28.240 --> 41:30.999
Come on, Einstein

41:31.160 --> 41:34.199
Good Lord, you're right.

41:38.440 --> 41:41.279
These aren't infrared at all.

41:41.440 --> 41:44.799
They're safelights!
Common standard-issue safelights!

41:44.960 --> 41:48.399
We're in a darkroom!
This room is a great big darkroom!

41:48.560 --> 41:52.719
- And this must be photographic paper.
- Meaning we can develop it?

41:52.880 --> 41:56.799
(BROWN) You hope... Developing photos
isn't a one-stage process.

41:56.960 --> 42:00.879
- It takes chemical baths, fixing agents...
- For colour photography.

42:01.040 --> 42:03.359
To pull black letters
from a white background

42:03.520 --> 42:05.239
all you need is developing fluid.

42:09.360 --> 42:10.839
Let's do this.

42:16.040 --> 42:17.879
I'm in.

42:21.920 --> 42:25.279
(BROWN) Even if she's right,
isn't a chemical shower a bad idea?

42:25.440 --> 42:28.239
It'll be diluted.
They wouldn't hire damaged goods.

42:28.400 --> 42:31.279
But covering your eyes,
nose and mouth may be wise.

42:32.320 --> 42:35.079
(BROWN) They're not the
only things worth covering.

42:39.920 --> 42:42.479
That's it: join in at last.

42:42.640 --> 42:44.719
You're deaf but not dumb, eh?

Let's go.

44:05.480 --> 44:08.359
- Well?
- It'll take a few moments.

44:55.320 --> 44:56.839
Where's my paper?

45:00.920 --> 45:03.239
(SHOUTS) Has anyone seen my paper?

45:17.600 --> 45:21.079
No!

45:27.120 --> 45:31.039
(SHOUTS) You bastard! Bastard!

45:31.200 --> 45:35.239
How could you?
How could you? Bastard!

46:07.160 --> 46:09.439
What did you just do?

46:10.600 --> 46:14.319
What l had to.

46:14.480 --> 46:16.719
I should punch your lights out!

46:19.720 --> 46:23.999
- (BLONDE) Black, what did you do?
- (BROWN) lt's not what he did.

46:24.160 --> 46:26.839
- (BROWN) lt's what he said.
- (DARK) What?

46:27.000 --> 46:30.319
(BROWN) "Lights out".
So...lights up!

46:37.040 --> 46:41.319
- That's better.
- Lights out.

46:41.480 --> 46:46.599
(BROWN) Lights up. Voice-activated.

46:46.760 --> 46:52.079
- They're playing with us.
- Great, isn't it?

46:52.240 --> 46:56.719
- Everybody watch what you say.
- And do.

Are you hungry, mate?
Oi, are you hungry?

47:58.520 --> 48:00.759
I am. l'm really hungry.

Oi! Rip it up!

- She said leave him alone, White.

48:21.880 --> 48:24.479
- (WHlTE) Tear it up!
- White, will you stop!

48:24.640 --> 48:28.159
Tear it up! Tear it!

48:31.320 --> 48:33.919

That's it, good boy. Go on.

So l lied!

49:32.320 --> 49:35.279
I lied. So what?

49:35.440 --> 49:38.319
Lying is not against the rules, is it?

49:40.200 --> 49:45.279
Anyway, you don't have to listen to me,
let alone agree or obey.

All of you should thank me.

any more help from us in finding it.

I don't need your help.
You'll find it's you who needs my help.

50:03.240 --> 50:05.759
You know why?
'Cause I figured it out.

50:05.920 --> 50:07.999
Oh, really? The question?
What is it, then?

50:08.160 --> 50:09.799
Why should I?

50:10.800 --> 50:14.039
Because if you don't,
I'll beat it out of you.

50:21.120 --> 50:23.119
You don't know anything.

He wouldn't tell us if he did,
'cause he's a narcissist.

50:26.640 --> 50:29.039
He despises us.

50:29.200 --> 50:31.719
Sticks and stones, love.

50:32.840 --> 50:35.159
I bet you say that to all the boys.

50:35.320 --> 50:37.839
Only the ones with
Narcissistic Personality Disorder.

50:38.000 --> 50:41.119
There are nine character traits
to look for:

50:41.280 --> 50:44.719
arrogance, grandiosity,
a belief in one's uniqueness,

50:44.880 --> 50:47.239
a preoccupation
with power and success,

50:47.400 --> 50:50.599
an excessive need to be admired,
a sense of entitlement,

50:50.760 --> 50:54.799
lack of empathy and the twin tendencies
to envy and exploit others.

50:54.960 --> 50:58.479
For clinical diagnosis,
a patient must exhibit five of these.

50:58.640 --> 51:02.359
- You tick enough boxes.
- You can add a tenth to that list.

51:02.520 --> 51:06.839
"A tendency to see through all the bullshit
surrounding you, and rise above it."

51:07.000 --> 51:10.719
- I'll tick that box myself.
- Let me tick it for you.

51:23.120 --> 51:25.959
- That was smart.
- That was necessary.

51:26.120 --> 51:28.399
We may need him. He's a resource.

51:28.560 --> 51:30.999
You don't like someone? Outwit them.

51:31.160 --> 51:33.719

52:04.800 --> 52:06.199
What are you doing?

52:06.360 --> 52:11.079
Ensuring that he can't cause
any more trouble when he wakes up.

52:11.240 --> 52:14.439
- And taking him out of the game.
- That hardly seems fair.

52:14.600 --> 52:18.079
He's sacrificed his right to fair treatment.
Forward a bit.

52:26.000 --> 52:31.359
See? I put him down
and suddenly we're cooperating again.

52:45.080 --> 52:47.519
He's a talker.

52:52.760 --> 52:55.039
We could go further than this.

52:56.560 --> 52:58.559
She's right.

52:58.720 --> 53:02.959
We could carry him
to the door and slide him out.

53:05.760 --> 53:08.759
He ejected two of us:
why shouldn't we eject him?

53:08.920 --> 53:13.719
- Call it justice, or karma if you prefer.
- You don't believe in forgiveness?

53:13.880 --> 53:17.879
- I'll forgive him afterwards.
- And your gospel of cooperation?

53:19.320 --> 53:23.599
I'll tolerate anyone, except the intolerant.

53:26.680 --> 53:28.519

You're choosing for him.

53:59.280 --> 54:02.239

This isn't funny! You know what happens
when you don't take suppressants!

56:29.720 --> 56:34.479
Unconsciousness. Convulsions.
Shock. Coma. Then death.

56:35.720 --> 56:37.159

Looks like you've got your wish.

57:17.720 --> 57:20.479
For now.

57:20.640 --> 57:23.679
He had to be dealt with
one way or another.

57:23.840 --> 57:26.839
I wouldn't be surprised
if he was a plant all along.

57:27.000 --> 57:31.079
It's the kind of thing they'd do
to stir up our internal dynamics.

57:31.240 --> 57:33.279
To set us against one another.

57:33.440 --> 57:36.839
If so, we've seized back the initiative.

57:37.000 --> 57:39.719

57:49.040 --> 57:51.039
You think she's one of them?

57:51.200 --> 57:53.759
Don't be absurd!
I told you l'm a psychologist!

57:53.920 --> 57:58.399
You claimed to be a qualified
student of psychology, not a practitioner.

58:00.360 --> 58:04.679
I've studied psychology too,
and reverse psychology.

58:04.840 --> 58:07.759
What better way to hide
your true role in this farce

58:07.920 --> 58:10.759
than to accuse another
candidate of playing your part?

58:10.920 --> 58:12.799
I don't know what you're talking about.

58:12.960 --> 58:15.759
Amateur psychology
is a useful tool for gamblers,

58:15.920 --> 58:18.599
but a degree in the subject

58:18.760 --> 58:24.479
sounds like the perfect foundation
for a career in, say human resources.

58:25.760 --> 58:28.039
You're on the wrong side
of the glass.

58:28.200 --> 58:31.439
- He's the one who manipulated...
- Maybe you work as a team.

58:31.600 --> 58:34.279
He's got the mouth, but you...

58:34.440 --> 58:38.199
..know an awful lot
about Biorg Pharmaceuticals.

58:38.360 --> 58:41.159
- I told you l applied!
- So did we.

58:41.320 --> 58:43.999
- And l do my research!
- So did we!

58:45.520 --> 58:48.759
Any of us could be plants,
but not all of us.

58:48.920 --> 58:52.199
At least one candidate has
to be genuine for the test to be viable.

58:52.360 --> 58:54.119
- That would be me.
- And me.

58:54.280 --> 58:58.239
My point is we can't prove
anyone's guilt or innocence,

58:58.400 --> 59:00.199
so it's a waste of time to try.

59:00.360 --> 59:02.959
If we can't maintain trust
and cooperation, we're through.

59:03.120 --> 59:05.439
Trust has to be earned, sister.

59:05.600 --> 59:08.879
We never had cause to trust
each other in the first place.

59:09.040 --> 59:13.559
Trust is a choice. We can choose
to keep cooperating, if necessary.

59:13.720 --> 59:16.559
- I think it's necessary.
- We have no other option.

59:16.720 --> 59:18.639
Trust makes me nervous.

59:20.720 --> 59:25.319
- I prefer proof.
- What are you doing?

59:25.480 --> 59:27.799
- (SHOUTS) Get off me!
- Are you insane?

59:27.960 --> 59:32.399
- Brown, why are you doing this?
- Because I like winning!

59:38.560 --> 59:40.839
Now tell us the truth, Dark.

59:41.000 --> 59:44.199
Please...
You said we've to trust each other!

59:44.360 --> 59:47.519
Now you're gonna stand there
while he interrogates me?

59:51.200 --> 59:53.559
Looks like it. They wanna know too.

59:55.120 --> 59:57.159
Further denials will only waste time.

59:57.320 --> 01:00:02.599
Confess and l'll release you. I promise.

01:00:14.120 --> 01:00:17.199
OK, I work for them,
but they didn't put me in here!

01:00:17.360 --> 01:00:20.679
I heard about the job internally
and applied like everyone else!

01:00:20.840 --> 01:00:23.399
Not everyone.

01:00:27.040 --> 01:00:29.879
Tell us what we want to know.

01:00:30.040 --> 01:00:33.799
I can't tell you anything because
I don't know anything!

01:00:33.960 --> 01:00:37.839
HR doesn't cover the CEO's office,
he hires his staff personally!

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:42.599
I'm not lying!
I wanna step up as badly as you do!

01:00:42.760 --> 01:00:47.239
Like l said,
trust is a devalued currency in here.

01:00:47.400 --> 01:00:50.959
What proof can I possibly give you?

01:01:11.840 --> 01:01:14.639
You know, it's funny...

01:01:14.800 --> 01:01:18.079
how something so simple
and inoffensive

01:01:18.240 --> 01:01:20.599
as a piece of paper,

01:01:20.760 --> 01:01:24.559
when placed in the wrong hands

01:01:24.720 --> 01:01:27.239
can become a deadly weapon.

01:01:29.040 --> 01:01:32.079
All from one slice of a tree.

01:01:35.320 --> 01:01:38.599
- What are you doing?
- What has to be done.

01:01:38.760 --> 01:01:41.279
You're gonna torture me?

01:01:41.440 --> 01:01:44.759
- Do something! Please!
- Brown, what are you doing?

01:01:44.920 --> 01:01:48.119
- I know what l'm doing.
- You've done this before?

01:01:48.280 --> 01:01:50.999
- In the services.
- I thought you were a gambler.

01:01:51.160 --> 01:01:53.279
All soldiers are gamblers.

01:01:53.440 --> 01:01:58.279
See, l find the flesh
of the inner thigh especially sensitive.

01:01:58.440 --> 01:02:03.039
- Fuck you! Get off me!
- Stop this! This can't be our only option!

01:02:03.200 --> 01:02:06.959
No, it isn't, it's mine.

01:02:15.280 --> 01:02:17.919
Seems you got there before me.

01:02:18.080 --> 01:02:22.279

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:29.039
You studied psychology to find out why?
Tell me I'm wrong.

01:02:29.200 --> 01:02:33.199
On second thoughts, don't answer that.
Answer this...

01:02:33.360 --> 01:02:37.559
- What is the question?
- I don't know!

01:02:37.720 --> 01:02:39.799
- You're lying!
- I don't know, I swear!

01:02:39.960 --> 01:02:42.439
What is the question?

01:02:42.600 --> 01:02:44.599
What is the purpose of this exam?

01:02:44.760 --> 01:02:48.799
Would I volunteer if the only way for you
to solve this was to beat it out of me?

01:02:48.960 --> 01:02:50.959
How fucked up are you?

01:02:52.720 --> 01:02:55.959
With 20 minutes left, this fucked up.

01:02:56.120 --> 01:02:57.919
- (DARK SCREAMS)
- OK, enough!

01:02:58.880 --> 01:03:01.959
(BLACK GROANS)

01:03:02.120 --> 01:03:05.079
Don't interfere.

01:03:06.720 --> 01:03:09.799
(GROANlNG)

01:03:09.960 --> 01:03:12.919
(BLACK)
For God's sake. This is a woman.

01:03:17.360 --> 01:03:19.719
Equal opportunities, Black.

01:03:19.880 --> 01:03:22.919
HR wouldn't expect anything less,
would they?

01:03:24.760 --> 01:03:27.359
Oh, by all means, ask him for help.

01:03:27.520 --> 01:03:29.079
Look, it's nothing personal.

01:03:29.240 --> 01:03:32.639
We just need to know what you know.

01:03:32.800 --> 01:03:37.799
Brown, don't do this!
There must be another way!

01:03:37.960 --> 01:03:39.919
We need certainty.

01:03:40.080 --> 01:03:43.519
The kind only unbearable pain can give...

01:03:47.320 --> 01:03:49.879
I've told you everything I know!

01:03:50.040 --> 01:03:52.599
Please stop!

01:03:55.640 --> 01:03:58.439
..or the threat of it.

01:03:58.600 --> 01:04:01.199
(DARK SOBS)

01:04:01.360 --> 01:04:04.039
She's telling the truth.

01:04:10.680 --> 01:04:13.519
Sorry.

01:04:25.040 --> 01:04:28.839
Here.

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:32.559
Thank you.

01:04:53.440 --> 01:04:56.079
(RATTLlNG)

01:05:19.960 --> 01:05:23.959
You wanted convulsions -
now you've got them.

01:05:30.920 --> 01:05:33.999
You think he's faking it.

01:05:34.160 --> 01:05:36.759
It's genuine.

01:05:36.920 --> 01:05:42.879
- How do you know?
- My wife, she died from it.

01:05:45.440 --> 01:05:48.439
I'm a carrier. He's not faking.

01:05:50.320 --> 01:05:52.879
Even liars tell the truth occasionally.

01:05:55.040 --> 01:05:58.479
- He really needs that pill, doesn't he?
- Fast.

01:06:00.760 --> 01:06:03.559
If anyone took it, own up now.

01:06:09.080 --> 01:06:13.839
All right, if we can't trust each other,
we'll have to search each other.

01:06:51.480 --> 01:06:54.159
Nothing.

01:07:04.760 --> 01:07:08.599
- Got any gum?
- Sorry. l'm all out.

01:07:11.080 --> 01:07:14.199
Really?

01:07:22.960 --> 01:07:26.679
All soldiers are gamblers

01:07:26.840 --> 01:07:29.399
and all gamblers are cheats, l've found.

01:07:29.560 --> 01:07:32.599
Given the opportunity.

01:07:32.760 --> 01:07:35.639
- I took a calculated risk.
- You're as bad as he is.

01:07:35.800 --> 01:07:38.839
No, he's worse. There was
never any pretence about White.

01:07:40.560 --> 01:07:43.559
- Let's think about it selfishly again.
- While he's dying?

01:07:43.720 --> 01:07:45.599
That's not selfishness, that's murder!

01:07:45.760 --> 01:07:49.199
Coma comes before death, right?
People recover from comas.

01:07:49.360 --> 01:07:51.879
Not this kind. Sink too deep
and it's irreversible.

01:07:52.040 --> 01:07:55.079
But that pill mimics
an adrenaline shot to the heart.

01:07:55.240 --> 01:07:59.239
- If you're gonna do it, do it now.
- Forgotten what you said about him?

01:07:59.400 --> 01:08:01.799
We're not releasing him
We're saving his life!

01:08:01.960 --> 01:08:05.039
I'm afraid I can't do that!

01:08:09.080 --> 01:08:10.919
(GRUNTING)

01:08:14.720 --> 01:08:16.759
I can see it, but l can't reach!

01:08:16.920 --> 01:08:19.078
Let me try!

01:08:26.399 --> 01:08:28.959
Obviously the Gods
agree with my risk assessment.

01:08:38.040 --> 01:08:40.038
Is he unconscious?

01:08:40.200 --> 01:08:43.519
(BLACK) He's lapsing!

01:08:43.680 --> 01:08:45.639
We have to carry him out for treatment.

01:08:47.880 --> 01:08:49.839
Biorg will understand. Trust me.

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:52.599
Are you gonna help me?

01:08:55.920 --> 01:08:58.999
Fine, you can live with his death
on your consciences. I can't.

01:09:09.080 --> 01:09:12.319
He's bleeding! What does that mean?

01:09:12.479 --> 01:09:16.038
I don't know: l haven't seen
this before. But it can't be good.

01:09:26.479 --> 01:09:30.559
- Do something, Black!
- Like what? I'm not a doctor!

01:09:30.720 --> 01:09:33.319
Help him, please!

01:09:33.479 --> 01:09:36.078
Can't you see he's dying?

01:09:39.160 --> 01:09:43.639
No! I work for you! I work here!

01:10:05.960 --> 01:10:08.159
(GASPS)

01:10:16.240 --> 01:10:19.039
You weren't wrong about that pill.

01:10:25.200 --> 01:10:26.879
Hey...

01:10:28.040 --> 01:10:30.439
- If you can hear me, nod your...
- Fuckers.

01:10:42.160 --> 01:10:44.399
I have it too, brother.

01:10:44.560 --> 01:10:48.199
Yeah, well, don't expect me to thank you.

01:10:49.480 --> 01:10:51.999
You have her to thank...

01:10:52.160 --> 01:10:53.599
..not me.

01:11:00.360 --> 01:11:02.679
Well, l would've preferred the kiss of life.

01:11:02.840 --> 01:11:06.199
I bet you're good at that.

01:11:10.040 --> 01:11:12.719
Wow.

01:11:12.880 --> 01:11:15.359
Four down and four to go.

01:11:17.240 --> 01:11:19.119
And only 1 0 minutes on the clock.

01:11:21.640 --> 01:11:24.639
Exciting (!)

01:11:29.480 --> 01:11:32.799
I felt you take it, you know.

01:11:32.960 --> 01:11:36.399
Room not big enough for both of us?

01:11:44.200 --> 01:11:47.439
That's the spirit, Brown.

01:11:56.560 --> 01:11:59.079
If you remember me taking it,

01:11:59.240 --> 01:12:03.159
you'll remember
the promise you made us.

01:12:03.320 --> 01:12:05.399
Blonde gave you the pill as requested.

01:12:05.560 --> 01:12:08.559
Now give us what we asked for in return.

01:12:10.120 --> 01:12:12.799
- The question?
- What is it?

01:12:12.960 --> 01:12:16.279
Where is it?

01:12:16.440 --> 01:12:19.479
You still don't get it, do you?

01:12:22.880 --> 01:12:25.879
Let me spell this out for you.

01:12:26.040 --> 01:12:28.919
(SlGHS)

01:12:29.080 --> 01:12:32.399
There is no question!

01:12:34.040 --> 01:12:37.599
All right?

01:12:37.760 --> 01:12:40.919
There never was one!

01:12:41.080 --> 01:12:43.879
Not the kind you're looking for anyway.

01:12:44.040 --> 01:12:47.039
That's what you've been holding back?

01:12:47.200 --> 01:12:50.839
- That's your big secret?
- Uh-huh.

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:52.799
You heard the lnvigilator.

01:12:52.960 --> 01:12:56.359
There's one question before you,
and one answer is required.

01:12:56.520 --> 01:12:58.679
There is one question!
You're calling him a liar?

01:12:58.840 --> 01:13:04.399
When you've eliminated the impossible,
whatever's left has to be the truth.

01:13:05.640 --> 01:13:08.559
No matter how crazy it seems.

01:13:11.520 --> 01:13:14.719
This test is the question!

01:13:16.480 --> 01:13:18.399
And the answer is us.

01:13:20.360 --> 01:13:24.559
- We're the answers.
- Answers, plural?

01:13:24.720 --> 01:13:27.639
- If l recall...
- One answer is required.

01:13:27.800 --> 01:13:30.999
- Singular.
- That's right.

01:13:32.680 --> 01:13:35.759
Just one of us.

01:13:42.280 --> 01:13:43.999
You wouldn't dare.

01:13:50.560 --> 01:13:51.959
Whoa! Whoa!

01:13:53.320 --> 01:13:57.079
- Whoa! Everybody calm down.
- Seconded.

01:13:57.240 --> 01:14:00.639
(GIGGLES) All right, all right, all right.

01:14:04.960 --> 01:14:08.879
- You're not gonna shoot me.
- I didn't take it to shoot you!

01:14:09.040 --> 01:14:12.479
I took it to stop you
from using it on us!

01:14:15.240 --> 01:14:17.039
Let me tell you what I think.

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:22.479
I think we're the answers too.
All of us together, as a team!

01:14:22.640 --> 01:14:24.839
I think we'd
all passed when we walked in.

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:27.719
All each of us can do
is lose what we've already won

01:14:27.880 --> 01:14:30.359
through selfishness,
stupidity and impatience!

01:14:34.120 --> 01:14:36.839
(BLACK) Deaf was right.

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:39.999
We see what we want to see in here.

01:14:40.160 --> 01:14:42.399
You're a fighter
so you all can think about

01:14:42.560 --> 01:14:44.159
is being the last man standing,

01:14:44.320 --> 01:14:47.839
but they never said
there was only one position available.

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:50.159
Yeah, l see what l want to see, Black.

01:14:50.320 --> 01:14:52.519
(GASPS)

01:14:52.680 --> 01:14:55.119
And you hear what you want to hear.

01:14:55.280 --> 01:14:57.479
But answer me this, brother (!)

01:14:57.640 --> 01:15:02.519
What corporation doesn't know
how many positions it's got available?

01:15:02.680 --> 01:15:07.839
What CEO can't decide whether he wants
one assistant or eight?

01:15:11.160 --> 01:15:14.879
There's only one job going
in his office, you know that?

01:15:15.040 --> 01:15:17.999
And the rest is fantasy.

01:15:23.640 --> 01:15:26.039
White, stay back!

01:15:26.200 --> 01:15:28.359
This ain't worth killing for.

01:15:28.520 --> 01:15:31.039
You seem to think it is.
Is it...

01:15:33.040 --> 01:15:36.879
- ..worth dying for?
- Put the gun down, Black.

01:15:38.760 --> 01:15:40.599
You started this, now it's in play!

01:15:40.760 --> 01:15:43.479
- We can't put it back.
- (BLONDE) Throw it out the door.

01:15:43.640 --> 01:15:46.519
That won't break any rules.

01:15:49.200 --> 01:15:52.239
Go on, then, shoot me.

01:15:52.400 --> 01:15:56.079
Go on, shoot me in the head, go on.

01:16:00.520 --> 01:16:03.759
- See? You can't fight who you are.
- Don't!

01:16:18.760 --> 01:16:21.399
(BLACK SCREAMS)

01:16:48.320 --> 01:16:50.999
Fingerprint ID.

01:16:54.480 --> 01:16:57.119
No!

01:16:59.480 --> 01:17:02.039
(WHITE) OK.

01:17:06.240 --> 01:17:07.999
(BROWN) OK, OK.

01:17:09.800 --> 01:17:11.959
Just tell us what you want.

01:17:12.120 --> 01:17:15.679
I want to be alone!

01:17:15.840 --> 01:17:18.879
You want us to spoil our papers?

01:17:19.040 --> 01:17:21.479
Disqualify ourselves?

01:17:23.360 --> 01:17:24.839
OK.

01:17:25.880 --> 01:17:29.039
We'll take those odds
over the alternative.

01:17:31.520 --> 01:17:34.039
You win.

01:17:40.160 --> 01:17:43.999
I can't let my partner escort you out,
we just became friends.

01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:52.239
How about you walk out instead?

01:17:52.400 --> 01:17:55.319
Each of you. One by one.

01:17:57.000 --> 01:17:59.719
Starting with you.

01:18:01.400 --> 01:18:03.759
Come on, we ain't got all day! Let's go.

01:18:16.440 --> 01:18:18.799
They deserve you.

01:18:24.240 --> 01:18:25.719
Now you.

01:18:32.720 --> 01:18:34.639
Come on.

01:18:37.280 --> 01:18:40.359
- Don't be stupid, Black.
- You won't shoot.

01:18:41.920 --> 01:18:43.999
I'll be missed.

01:18:45.320 --> 01:18:47.599
You're sick like me.

01:18:47.760 --> 01:18:51.719
Your death will be explained away, OK?

01:18:51.880 --> 01:18:55.239
No one outside this room even cares.

01:18:55.400 --> 01:18:59.759
They've got problems of their own,
like avoiding the infection themselves.

01:19:01.200 --> 01:19:03.879
Your conscience will haunt you.

01:19:05.600 --> 01:19:07.959
You're assuming l've got one.

01:19:11.440 --> 01:19:13.999
I'll go. I'm through with this.

01:19:17.800 --> 01:19:19.279
(Ready?)

01:19:28.960 --> 01:19:30.439
Don't cry, darlin'.

01:19:30.600 --> 01:19:34.119
You were a passenger in here, anyway.

01:19:34.280 --> 01:19:38.039
- You fucked your way to the top.
- Then l saved your life.

01:19:40.480 --> 01:19:43.119
Well, anyone can make a mistake.

01:19:49.600 --> 01:19:51.599
Lights out!

01:19:56.840 --> 01:19:58.879
Lights on!

01:20:54.640 --> 01:20:57.199
(SlGHS)

01:21:31.880 --> 01:21:34.639
Toujours y voir clairement
est primordial.

01:21:34.800 --> 01:21:36.799
(DARK) To see clearly is all.

01:21:52.520 --> 01:21:53.999
Well?

01:21:55.920 --> 01:22:00.519
You said there's one answer
and you're looking at him!

01:22:01.440 --> 01:22:05.359
I've done everything!
I made everything happen in here,

01:22:05.520 --> 01:22:07.519
and she's done nothing!

01:22:08.480 --> 01:22:11.199
It's me! l'm the one you want!

01:22:11.360 --> 01:22:13.559
I'M THE ONE YOU WANT!

01:22:13.720 --> 01:22:15.799
(FOOTSTEPS)

01:22:51.760 --> 01:22:55.959
If you try to communicate
with myself or the guard...

01:22:57.520 --> 01:22:59.959
..you will be disqualified.

01:23:09.960 --> 01:23:12.439
(WHlTE) That's it, join in at last.

01:23:12.600 --> 01:23:15.239
You're deaf but not dumb, eh?

01:23:25.080 --> 01:23:27.479
(BEEPING)

01:25:40.240 --> 01:25:44.599
There is one question before you,
and one answer is required.

01:26:21.040 --> 01:26:22.399
(Ready?)

01:26:26.880 --> 01:26:29.959
- Answers?
- That's what you've been holding back?

01:26:30.120 --> 01:26:34.679
- That's your big secret?
- You still don't get it, do you?

01:26:34.840 --> 01:26:36.799
What is it? Where is it?

01:26:36.960 --> 01:26:39.559
- The question?
- What's the purpose of this exam?

01:26:39.720 --> 01:26:44.039
- The question? What is it? Tell us!
- What does it matter?

01:26:44.200 --> 01:26:47.039
(BLONDE) You really think
he's behind there?

01:26:47.200 --> 01:26:49.919
(DARK) He's lived behind walls for years.

01:26:50.080 --> 01:26:52.159
(BROWN) How do you know all this?

01:26:52.320 --> 01:26:56.079
Are you saying that they rigged
the test to bring us all together?

01:26:57.480 --> 01:26:59.479
Is there something you want to tell us?

01:26:59.640 --> 01:27:02.479
- (BRUNETTE) lt's a piece of paper.
- (WHITE) It's more than that.

01:27:02.640 --> 01:27:05.199
lf we can't see it,
how are we supposed to find it?

01:27:05.360 --> 01:27:08.959
(BRUNETTE) What if the question
is written down? We just can't see it?

01:27:09.120 --> 01:27:11.479
(BLONDE) What if it reveals
the question too?

01:27:11.640 --> 01:27:13.959
(WHlTE) They're not gonna
make it that easy.

01:27:14.120 --> 01:27:16.639
(BRUNETTE) How hard
can they afford to make it?

01:27:18.280 --> 01:27:20.719
(WHlTE) So has anyone
figured out the answer yet?

01:27:20.880 --> 01:27:24.759
(BROWN) lt's not about the answer,
it's about the question.

01:27:25.920 --> 01:27:28.079
What is the question?

01:27:28.240 --> 01:27:31.999
(TICKlNG)

01:27:41.800 --> 01:27:44.719
What is the question?

01:27:44.880 --> 01:27:48.559
(TICKlNG)

01:28:00.360 --> 01:28:03.319
Any questions?

01:28:06.760 --> 01:28:08.279
No.

01:28:09.720 --> 01:28:14.359
That's the answer you wanted
to the first question asked of us.

01:28:14.520 --> 01:28:16.879
The only question asked of you.

01:28:19.120 --> 01:28:22.399
- I almost missed it too.
- Almost.

01:28:22.560 --> 01:28:25.399
As it is, we're happy
to be hiring someone today.

01:28:26.440 --> 01:28:28.359
I haven't accepted yet.

01:28:28.520 --> 01:28:31.679
You wouldn't have participated
if you didn't want the job.

01:28:31.840 --> 01:28:35.279
That was before. Before all this.

01:28:37.560 --> 01:28:40.279
Now it's over, I have questions.

01:28:40.440 --> 01:28:43.839
- Questions?
- More than one.

01:28:48.880 --> 01:28:51.639
Ask.

01:28:53.920 --> 01:28:56.679
You don't look like him.

01:28:57.680 --> 01:29:03.839
Any suit can play the CEO
for shareholders and the media.

01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:08.239
Our founder isn't a businessman.

01:29:08.400 --> 01:29:11.879
- He has no interest in fame.
- Too bad.

01:29:12.040 --> 01:29:15.559
- That was some performance.
- Who said it was a performance?

01:29:17.560 --> 01:29:21.439
Our founder is a scientist, an innovator.

01:29:21.600 --> 01:29:25.479
He's very particular about those
he invites to work with him,

01:29:25.640 --> 01:29:29.439
especially when it comes to the most
important hiring decision he's ever made.

01:29:29.600 --> 01:29:32.759
Important enough to kill for?

01:29:36.480 --> 01:29:39.839
What makes you think he's dead?

01:29:55.720 --> 01:29:58.719
(SOFT BREATHING)

01:30:25.240 --> 01:30:27.559
(lNVlGlLATOR)
While searching for the cure,

01:30:27.720 --> 01:30:31.239
we stumbled upon
something far more powerful.

01:30:36.640 --> 01:30:39.679
Rapid cell regeneration...

01:30:43.440 --> 01:30:46.199
..in a pill.

01:30:48.200 --> 01:30:52.519
It eradicates the virus
and other stubborn mutations.

01:30:52.680 --> 01:30:57.479
- The magic bullet.
- The gift of life for millions.

01:31:02.080 --> 01:31:08.679
Such a breakthrough
creates unanticipated dilemmas.

01:31:10.560 --> 01:31:13.279
Too great for any one man to bear.

01:31:17.560 --> 01:31:20.879
People are gonna need this product,

01:31:21.040 --> 01:31:24.319
and we can only make so much at a time.

01:31:24.480 --> 01:31:27.959
Tough decisions are gonna have to be
made by a wise administrator,

01:31:28.120 --> 01:31:32.079
someone who combines
a listening disposition

01:31:32.240 --> 01:31:35.599
with attention to detail

01:31:35.760 --> 01:31:39.599
and compassion for her fellow man.

01:31:42.760 --> 01:31:46.719
If you are still interested...

01:32:37.240 --> 01:32:39.639
Il est revenu.

01:32:45.480 --> 01:32:47.999
He is...

01:32:50.840 --> 01:32:52.879
..risen.

01:33:04.264 --> 01:33:05.849
Let's get started.
