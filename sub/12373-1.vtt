WEBVTT

02:23.321 --> 02:25.551
Secure from quarters.
All ahead two-thirds.

02:25.624 --> 02:26.886
All ahead two-thirds.

02:27.192 --> 02:30.423
Come left, heading 190.
Set depth for 100 meters.

02:30.662 --> 02:35.122
Aye, aye! 20 degrees down angle
on the bow planes. Come left 190.

02:35.467 --> 02:37.867
-Range to destination?
-Eight kilometers.

03:12.604 --> 03:14.765
Hoskins, what are the conditions up there?

03:14.873 --> 03:17.967
Thirty degrees below zero, sir,
and we've got a storm moving in.

03:18.110 --> 03:19.475
Landing party on deck.

03:21.379 --> 03:23.847
Collect your data quickly
and get back to the ship.

03:23.949 --> 03:26.577
No one can survive for long
in that kind of cold.

04:08.393 --> 04:09.291
Koonak.

04:12.631 --> 04:13.859
Do you have dinner?

04:16.334 --> 04:17.665
Salmon!

04:33.451 --> 04:37.615
One hundred meters to surface. Reading
a layer of ice beneath mountainous terrain.

04:38.190 --> 04:39.350
Possibly a cave.

04:39.424 --> 04:41.858
-All back one-third.
-All back one-third.

04:56.241 --> 05:01.008
Fifteen years today, darling.
Did you think l would forget?

05:03.548 --> 05:04.674
How could l?

05:06.318 --> 05:09.253
The day we met
was the happiest day of my life.

05:12.691 --> 05:16.320
A gift for you. l found it in the snow.

05:17.529 --> 05:21.465
Fragile beauty clinging to life
in this frozen wasteland.

05:22.868 --> 05:24.233
Like you, Nora.

05:30.642 --> 05:34.942
Thirty meters below surface and closing.
Estimate impact in fifteen seconds.

05:41.386 --> 05:43.547
How long does she have to stay in there?

05:44.322 --> 05:46.347
Until a cure can be found.

05:47.259 --> 05:50.786
Until then, my love, we'll be here together.

06:11.850 --> 06:12.839
Nora!

06:28.199 --> 06:29.291
Let's move out.

07:16.982 --> 07:20.440
-Man, l've never seen it that cold.
-Let's get inside.

07:27.359 --> 07:28.917
What in the name of....

07:33.598 --> 07:35.828
My God! What happened?

07:37.669 --> 07:41.070
-lt's the whole crew.
-Not quite.

08:43.268 --> 08:45.828
You punks have robbed me
for the last time.

08:45.904 --> 08:48.771
Myron, let the police handle it.
Come away.

08:48.840 --> 08:51.775
-Do what she says, old man.
-l'm not afraid of you.

08:57.148 --> 08:58.172
Myron!

08:59.217 --> 09:00.514
l warned you, mister.

09:06.658 --> 09:07.556
Drive!

09:16.101 --> 09:19.832
Man, there must be
a couple of grand worth of stuff here.

09:20.138 --> 09:22.231
Yeah, l told you it'd be easy.

09:28.246 --> 09:29.304
What was that?

09:48.399 --> 09:50.264
-Let's call the cops.
-Yeah, come on!

09:53.738 --> 09:55.763
-What happened?
-l don't know.

10:05.083 --> 10:05.981
Jeez!

10:32.944 --> 10:34.468
Please, don't hurt me.

10:49.527 --> 10:52.428
Listen, scum,
we're going to be watching you.

11:00.738 --> 11:03.070
Keep your hands where we can see them.

11:11.316 --> 11:13.750
-Yes, Alfred.
-We're running late, sir.

11:13.918 --> 11:15.510
The party has already started.

11:15.587 --> 11:18.852
-Meet us in two minutes.
-Very good, sir. On my way.

11:44.349 --> 11:46.977
Thanks, Alfred.
l don't know what we'd do without you.

11:48.019 --> 11:50.112
Frankly, sir, neither do l.

12:18.116 --> 12:20.812
-Bruce!
-John, looks like a good turnout.

12:20.885 --> 12:23.046
-Thanks for inviting us.
-Have a good time.

12:23.121 --> 12:27.581
-There you are. Hello, Bruce, Dick.
-Commissioner.

12:27.792 --> 12:30.283
-Good to see a familiar face.
-Where's Barbara?

12:30.428 --> 12:33.226
You know my daughter.
She's probably still getting ready.

12:39.937 --> 12:41.029
My little girl.

12:41.172 --> 12:43.697
You know, Dick,
there's no one sweeter in the world.

12:53.785 --> 12:56.811
You've got plenty of competition.
Lots of guys are after her.

12:57.322 --> 12:59.449
-l'm out of here! Go!
-Move it!

13:00.692 --> 13:01.920
Are you all right?

13:06.931 --> 13:08.228
Hey! Thanks.

13:08.733 --> 13:11.463
But don't worry, you're on top of her list.

13:16.074 --> 13:20.568
-You and Barbara getting serious?
-Maybe. You got any advice on women?

13:20.878 --> 13:24.405
There you are.
Bruce, where have you been?

13:24.916 --> 13:27.009
My friends are just dying to meet you.

13:29.887 --> 13:31.582
Let me get back to you on that.

13:33.458 --> 13:37.053
Here he is, ladies.
Gotham's most elusive bachelor.

13:37.462 --> 13:39.123
lsn't he handsome?

13:39.564 --> 13:45.434
-Bruce, this is Buffy and Debra and Caitlin.
-Hello, Bruce! So nice to meet you!

13:52.043 --> 13:53.442
Well, excuse you.

13:54.579 --> 13:57.139
l'd keep my money
in low-risk mutual funds...

13:57.248 --> 13:59.716
-...that way, if the market dips--
-We have to talk.

14:00.284 --> 14:03.014
Gregory, l didn't know
we had a meeting scheduled.

14:03.154 --> 14:05.179
-Would you excuse us for a minute?
-Hey!

14:05.656 --> 14:10.286
-How come you're not returning my calls?
-l told you, there's nothing more l can do.

14:10.495 --> 14:13.430
You're my stockbroker.
You got me into this, now get me out.

14:13.498 --> 14:16.626
l got you....
Listen, you got yourself into this.

14:16.801 --> 14:18.792
l warned you that futures are risky.

14:19.103 --> 14:22.368
Everything l own is on the line here.
This will ruin me!

14:22.473 --> 14:25.567
Hey, you rolled the dice,
you'd better be able to cover the bet.

14:25.643 --> 14:29.409
Those calls come due in a few days,
and you're legally required to pay them.

14:29.547 --> 14:31.139
But l don't have the cash.

14:31.482 --> 14:35.816
-Can't you stall, buy me some time?
-l'm sorry. There's nothing more l can do.

14:38.823 --> 14:39.619
Thanks.

15:06.150 --> 15:07.014
Hey there!

15:08.486 --> 15:09.384
Sweetheart.

15:09.587 --> 15:11.612
Hi, Dad. Sorry l'm late.

15:14.358 --> 15:16.588
Look at you. Honey, you're a knockout!

15:16.928 --> 15:18.156
Thanks, Dad.

15:18.796 --> 15:22.596
Someone's been looking for you.
Boy, is he one lucky guy.

15:22.767 --> 15:25.634
Hey, what's the idea
of keeping me waiting so long?

15:26.604 --> 15:28.071
Just playing hard to get.

15:28.306 --> 15:31.104
-She is hard to get.
-Dad!

15:31.776 --> 15:34.006
Well, before your dance card fills up,
may l?

15:35.146 --> 15:37.944
-l get the next dance.
-Don't count on it.

15:41.652 --> 15:45.816
Expect record highs for the rest of the
week with temperatures in the mid-90s.

16:00.204 --> 16:01.068
Jeez!

16:29.500 --> 16:33.334
-Hello, Gregory.
-Victor? My God, is that you?

16:34.138 --> 16:36.470
You're a hard man to get a hold of, Doctor.

16:36.841 --> 16:40.277
Your secretary wouldn't give me
an appointment until next September.

16:40.912 --> 16:43.506
Now, is that any way
to treat an old colleague?

16:44.148 --> 16:47.948
-What do you want?
-l've got a patient who needs you.

16:51.989 --> 16:54.890
-Leaving so soon?
-l have to work late tonight.

16:54.959 --> 16:56.324
l've heard that before.

16:56.794 --> 17:00.662
-l'll call you tomorrow, Ronnie. l promise.
-l've heard that one, too.

17:01.499 --> 17:04.627
We're going to dance some more.
Barbara will give me a ride home.

17:04.702 --> 17:05.964
Have a nice time.

17:07.939 --> 17:09.133
l wish l were.

17:15.613 --> 17:17.672
l thought you wanted to dance some more.

17:18.049 --> 17:21.143
l do, but first l wanted
to ask you something.

17:21.352 --> 17:24.287
-What?
-Well, l was wondering....

17:24.789 --> 17:25.618
What?

17:26.290 --> 17:28.484
You want to go up the coast
for the weekend?

17:28.859 --> 17:31.692
-Sure. With who?
-With me!

17:34.265 --> 17:38.133
There's a jazz festival in Rockport,
and there's stuff going on at the beach.

17:38.936 --> 17:40.927
Sounds fun. l'd love to.

17:41.672 --> 17:43.765
Really? That's great!

18:04.562 --> 18:07.258
Alfred, would you mind turning up
the air conditioning?

18:08.866 --> 18:09.924
Good heavens!

18:12.937 --> 18:15.906
Strange. There's not a cloud in the sky.

18:33.190 --> 18:35.385
Belongs to someone named Belson.

18:47.738 --> 18:48.932
lt's not good.

18:49.306 --> 18:52.605
When her containment vessel ruptured,
her disease relapsed.

18:52.677 --> 18:55.544
-She's got a couple of weeks at best.
-What?

18:55.613 --> 18:58.844
Don't shoot the messenger, Victor.
l'm just telling you like it is.

18:58.916 --> 19:01.612
Nothing can save her now,
short of an organ transplant.

19:01.786 --> 19:02.946
Then, do it.

19:03.354 --> 19:07.848
lmpossible. You need a compatible donor,
and there's a waiting list a mile long.

19:08.159 --> 19:10.024
We'd never get the organ in time.

19:10.494 --> 19:14.897
-l have confidence you'll find a way.
-Don't threaten me, Victor.

19:15.299 --> 19:18.234
l'm the only hope she's got.
And this is going to cost you.

19:18.436 --> 19:21.530
The kind of service we're talking
about here doesn't come cheap.

19:22.573 --> 19:25.599
Gregory. l see you haven't changed.

19:28.879 --> 19:29.846
Gold?

19:44.095 --> 19:46.154
There aren't any available organs.

19:47.298 --> 19:50.165
-What about these?
-Not compatible.

19:50.768 --> 19:52.861
Nora's blood type is extremely rare.

19:53.504 --> 19:55.734
There aren't any deceased donors
that match.

19:56.273 --> 20:01.233
-Then we'll have to use a live donor.
-What? Are you crazy? They'd die!

20:01.746 --> 20:02.770
l know.

20:05.583 --> 20:09.280
Man, you're a piece of work.
l said l'd help, but this....

20:09.453 --> 20:12.251
This is going to cost you
more than a little gold nugget.

20:12.389 --> 20:14.152
l mean, the risks involved....

20:14.592 --> 20:18.858
This is just a small sample
from a large vein l discovered in the Arctic.

20:19.396 --> 20:22.524
You do this, and it's yours. All of it.

20:29.707 --> 20:32.733
These hospital files
list every blood donor in Gotham.

20:33.444 --> 20:37.380
We want someone who's approximately
the same weight, height, and female.

20:44.288 --> 20:45.312
Here's one.

20:46.624 --> 20:47.784
Perfect.

20:49.226 --> 20:51.956
Her name is Barbara Gordon.

21:06.310 --> 21:08.039
-Hello?
-Barbara Gordon?

21:08.512 --> 21:10.912
No, she's not here.
This is Jenny, her roommate.

21:11.282 --> 21:14.547
-What time do you expect her in?
-She won't be back till Monday.

21:14.752 --> 21:18.051
-Who is this, please?
-This is County Memorial Hospital.

21:18.222 --> 21:20.383
Barbara's listed with us as a blood donor.

21:21.125 --> 21:24.822
She's dining out with her boyfriend.
They are at the coast for the weekend.

21:25.396 --> 21:28.160
We've got an emergency.
Where did they go for dinner?

21:28.265 --> 21:30.961
l think she said Shaugnessy's,
over on Madison.

22:02.333 --> 22:03.231
Thanks.

22:08.372 --> 22:09.236
Hey!

22:14.912 --> 22:16.140
Didn't spill a drop.

22:19.216 --> 22:21.741
-Oh, man!
-lt could have been worse.

22:22.553 --> 22:25.283
-Yeah, how?
-lt could have been me.

22:27.258 --> 22:31.490
-We got enough left for a toast?
-Sure. What will we drink to?

22:32.263 --> 22:34.697
How about the kiss
you're about to give me?

22:35.399 --> 22:36.696
l'll drink to that.

22:43.574 --> 22:44.768
Mr. Freeze?

22:52.816 --> 22:55.216
You, fruitcake! No pets allowed!

23:01.058 --> 23:02.719
Which one of you is Barbara Gordon?

23:10.167 --> 23:10.929
Him.

23:18.275 --> 23:19.299
Please, no.

23:20.878 --> 23:23.278
Get him off! Get him off me!

23:24.481 --> 23:28.212
l'll ask again.
Which one of you is Barbara Gordon?

23:29.353 --> 23:31.287
-Barbara, no!
-l am.

23:32.423 --> 23:33.412
Let him go.

23:36.026 --> 23:37.152
Come with me.

23:47.738 --> 23:49.501
Notchka, don't let her go.

24:36.687 --> 24:39.713
Stop it! l'll come with you.
Just don't hurt him.

24:41.492 --> 24:42.686
Shaka, come.

25:47.558 --> 25:49.025
Here! Take my Corvette.

25:51.161 --> 25:52.492
Hey! Watch it!

26:34.771 --> 26:37.569
All units,
this is Unit 7 in pursuit of a gray van...

26:37.641 --> 26:40.007
...moving east on Highway 10.
Request backup.

26:40.077 --> 26:41.203
Roger, Unit 7.

27:16.947 --> 27:17.879
Hey!

29:21.171 --> 29:24.402
-Who are you?
-l'm a doctor. Keep still.

29:24.908 --> 29:26.000
Where am l?

29:29.413 --> 29:31.347
Take these. You'll feel better.

29:36.453 --> 29:38.683
-Why did you kidnap me?
-Silence!

29:41.224 --> 29:42.919
Do as you're told. Take them.

29:45.696 --> 29:46.663
Victor, no!

29:47.464 --> 29:50.729
Miss Gordon obviously prefers
not to take any medication right now.

29:51.835 --> 29:54.099
Why don't we give her
some time to herself?.

29:54.838 --> 29:56.897
l want to know what's going on here.

30:12.422 --> 30:16.791
l want checkpoints on a 20-mile radius
at l-13, l-54, and out to Route 27.

30:17.260 --> 30:20.161
Choppers with infrared scopes,
and a door-to-door search...

30:20.230 --> 30:22.494
...of every possible hideout within 50 miles.

30:23.800 --> 30:26.428
Montoya, set up a command post
in the operations room.

30:26.503 --> 30:27.333
Right.

30:27.537 --> 30:30.768
-Did you get a rundown on the license?
-lt's a stolen van.

30:31.274 --> 30:34.437
They found it ditched in Brisco Canyon
about an hour ago.

30:35.379 --> 30:39.679
All right, that's pretty rugged terrain.
They can't have gotten too far on foot.

30:40.050 --> 30:43.850
Set up checkpoints at a 20-mile radius,
and search all the way down to the ocean.

30:44.588 --> 30:48.684
Come on, people. A guy in a weird suit
with two polar bears can't be hard to spot.

30:49.092 --> 30:51.583
l want my daughter found,
and l want her found now.

30:51.795 --> 30:55.697
-Don't worry, sir. We're on it.
-Then why are you still here talking to me?

30:55.832 --> 30:57.265
Come on, let's move out.

31:00.370 --> 31:01.564
Dick, you okay?

31:01.872 --> 31:04.932
-Sorry, Commissioner. l tried to stop him.
-l know.

31:05.175 --> 31:07.006
When l get my hands on this guy....

31:07.110 --> 31:10.375
-Jim, why would Freeze want Barbara?
-l don't know.

31:10.881 --> 31:13.907
-How'd he know she was at the nightclub?
-Her roommate.

31:14.785 --> 31:17.777
Said someone called from the hospital
with an emergency.

31:18.021 --> 31:19.852
Barbara's listed as a blood donor.

31:20.023 --> 31:23.151
-Did she get a name?
-No. The guy hung up on her.

31:23.560 --> 31:26.859
Get a hold of the phone records
and see if you can trace that call.

31:28.398 --> 31:31.196
Commissioner,
the other witnesses are in interrogation.

31:31.368 --> 31:35.634
On my way.
Dick, thanks again for trying to save her.

31:37.974 --> 31:40.602
-Mr. Grayson, what is your blood type?
-O positive.

31:42.913 --> 31:46.440
l need to get you down to X-ray.
You wait here. l'll get a wheelchair.

31:50.387 --> 31:51.445
Shut the door.

32:06.403 --> 32:09.099
-Does it say who accessed her file?
-No.

32:13.376 --> 32:16.470
She has a rare blood type.
Not many others on the list.

32:17.881 --> 32:20.076
Wait a minute. Look at this.

32:20.851 --> 32:22.216
Nora Fries?

32:23.453 --> 32:25.114
Victor Fries' wife.

33:15.472 --> 33:16.939
She's over the next room.

33:36.459 --> 33:38.654
She's headed
towards the northwest corner.

34:30.813 --> 34:31.940
Get away from her!

34:33.717 --> 34:35.081
You get away from me.

34:40.190 --> 34:42.818
Give it up, Barbara.
There's no place to run.

34:42.891 --> 34:46.054
-Everybody, just calm down.
-No! You calm down.

34:46.228 --> 34:48.060
l want to know what l'm doing here.

34:48.297 --> 34:51.529
l'm Dr. Gregory Belson. That's Victor Fries.

34:52.068 --> 34:55.264
l know who he is.
Everyone in Gotham knows you.

34:55.505 --> 34:59.464
And l know who that is, too.
l thought your wife was dead.

34:59.843 --> 35:02.107
She will be dead if you don't help her.

35:02.512 --> 35:06.073
That's what this is about, isn't it?
lt's about her.

35:06.716 --> 35:09.617
She needs an operation
that requires a transfusion.

35:09.886 --> 35:12.514
You're one of the few people
with her rare blood type.

35:13.790 --> 35:16.418
So, why here? She should be in a hospital.

35:16.559 --> 35:18.823
No hospitals and no more questions!

35:18.962 --> 35:21.658
Victor! You wouldn't let her die,
would you?

35:21.965 --> 35:25.457
Listen. You kidnap me,
then expect me to cooperate?

35:26.002 --> 35:28.436
l'll help her, but not here. Not this way.

35:28.705 --> 35:29.637
Enough talk!

35:33.276 --> 35:35.301
Victor, no! Don't freeze her.

35:48.391 --> 35:49.289
The door!

36:24.360 --> 36:25.418
Come on.

37:41.971 --> 37:42.835
Mariko?

37:43.640 --> 37:47.041
Bruce, Dick. What a nice surprise.
Come in, come in.

37:47.443 --> 37:50.435
-What can l do for you?
-l was wondering if you could help me.

37:50.713 --> 37:52.908
Are you kidding?
One of our major investors?

37:53.116 --> 37:54.276
What do you need?

37:54.350 --> 37:57.615
How much do you know
about the medical aspects of cryogenics?

37:57.887 --> 38:02.153
Well, it's not exactly my specialty,
but l've done some reading on it.

38:02.625 --> 38:06.959
When would a person who's cryogenically
frozen need a blood transfusion?

38:07.530 --> 38:10.863
As far as l know, never.
That's the point of the procedure.

38:11.467 --> 38:13.958
You should talk to someone
who is more of an expert.

38:14.037 --> 38:16.267
Who is the foremost authority
on the subject?

38:16.973 --> 38:19.373
That's easy. Dr. Gregory Belson.

38:19.576 --> 38:22.602
He did a lot of the original research
on it with Victor Fries.

38:27.050 --> 38:28.483
l'd like to talk to him.

38:28.985 --> 38:31.317
Good luck.
No one's seen him for the past week.

38:31.621 --> 38:33.145
-Where is he?
-Who knows?

38:33.289 --> 38:36.417
Comes and goes as he pleases.
Frankly, he's kind of a jerk.

38:38.361 --> 38:42.195
Belson's name was on the registration
of a wrecked car Alfred and l found...

38:42.265 --> 38:45.325
...after the party the other night.
lt was surrounded by water.

38:45.735 --> 38:47.862
-Melted ice.
-Right.

38:48.204 --> 38:51.833
-So what does Freeze want with a doctor?
-Let's find out.

38:56.679 --> 38:59.204
You don't have to chain me up, you creep.

39:00.450 --> 39:03.248
Try to escape again,
l'll chain your feet as well.

39:03.386 --> 39:07.322
-How can you treat people this way?
-lt's the way they've always treated me.

39:09.726 --> 39:13.492
Nora was the only good thing in my life,
and they took her from me.

39:13.930 --> 39:16.398
l don't care what l have to do
to get her back.

39:35.418 --> 39:38.979
-Nothing here, except some stock reports.
-Keep looking.

39:46.229 --> 39:49.096
Gregory, this is your broker calling
for the third time.

39:49.332 --> 39:52.893
Payment is due on those options
and accounting is breathing down my neck.

39:52.969 --> 39:57.303
You can call me at home.
The number's 555-01 73.

39:57.607 --> 39:59.598
Let's take care of this, okay?

40:04.180 --> 40:05.704
Hope it's a listed number.

40:09.919 --> 40:10.908
Bingo.

40:24.534 --> 40:25.364
Dinner.

40:27.003 --> 40:29.665
-Who are you?
-My name is Koonak.

40:30.673 --> 40:33.164
You're just a kid.
What are you doing here?

40:33.309 --> 40:37.006
-Did Freeze kidnap you, too?
-No. And l'm not just a kid.

40:37.347 --> 40:39.872
-l'm twelve.
-Twelve?

40:40.383 --> 40:43.910
-And very handsome.
-You're kind of cute, too, lady.

40:45.154 --> 40:48.419
-You sure you're just twelve?
-Thirteen, next summer.

40:48.691 --> 40:52.252
-So, where are your parents, Koonak?
-They're dead.

40:54.630 --> 40:57.861
-l'm sorry.
-But Mr. Freeze takes care of me now.

40:58.468 --> 41:02.029
-Freeze? You've got to be kidding.
-You don't like him, do you?

41:02.271 --> 41:05.707
lt's kind of hard to like someone
who kidnaps you and chains you up.

41:06.242 --> 41:08.870
He just wants his wife back.
He's not really bad.

41:09.245 --> 41:11.076
You know this isn't right, Koonak.

41:11.614 --> 41:15.607
Help me get out of here, and l promise
l'll do everything l can to help her.

41:16.285 --> 41:17.752
Sorry, lady. l can't.

41:24.327 --> 41:27.319
-You won't hurt her, will you?
-No, of course not.

41:28.164 --> 41:30.291
Your wife's vital signs have stabilized.

41:30.400 --> 41:33.233
We'll be able to start the operation
in a couple of hours.

41:33.770 --> 41:34.464
Good.

42:07.136 --> 42:08.467
Please, don't hurt me!

42:08.638 --> 42:11.436
-Where's Belson?
-Belson? l wish l knew.

42:13.609 --> 42:16.476
-l'm telling you the truth!
-What's your interest in him?

42:16.546 --> 42:20.573
l'm his stockbroker. He owes $2.5 million,
and if he doesn't pay by Friday...

42:20.650 --> 42:23.949
-...they're going to foreclose on him.
-What are you talking about?

42:24.087 --> 42:27.250
Belson had inside information
on a new drug that was going public.

42:27.523 --> 42:29.684
He leveraged futures
with everything he had.

42:29.792 --> 42:33.455
Then some side effects were discovered,
and the FDA put everything on hold.

42:33.763 --> 42:35.196
He lost, big time.

42:35.498 --> 42:38.797
l want to see his portfolio,
and any holdings he might have in--

42:44.207 --> 42:46.334
-Hello?
-Dean, this is Gregory.

42:47.110 --> 42:48.702
Gregory? Where are you?

42:49.479 --> 42:51.947
You've got to buy me one more week
with the SEC.

42:52.348 --> 42:56.045
Stall them. Say whatever you have to,
but l'll have the cash by then.

42:56.586 --> 42:58.144
You will? How? You said--

42:58.287 --> 43:01.347
l know what l said, but l just struck gold.

43:04.393 --> 43:06.327
So, you'll take care of that, right?

43:06.462 --> 43:07.486
Where are you?

43:07.964 --> 43:08.828
Never mind.

43:08.965 --> 43:12.423
Just keep them from foreclosing for a week
and they'll have their money.

43:12.502 --> 43:13.366
Got to go.

43:13.769 --> 43:15.202
Gregory? Wait a minute.

43:40.463 --> 43:44.399
Alfred, run this list of medical supplies
l found on Belson's desk.

43:44.800 --> 43:47.234
l want to know
what this stuff would be used for.

43:47.303 --> 43:50.238
Cross-reference it
against all likely medical procedures.

43:50.306 --> 43:51.364
Very good, sir.

43:57.413 --> 44:01.144
-You said--
-l know what l said, but l just struck gold.

44:01.584 --> 44:04.109
-So, you'll take care of that, right?
-Where are you?

44:04.187 --> 44:05.620
That's a ship's foghorn.

44:06.022 --> 44:07.649
He's somewhere near the water.

44:07.723 --> 44:10.191
But the police have combed every inch
of the coast.

44:10.293 --> 44:13.524
Listen to it again.
There's something else in the background.

44:14.030 --> 44:15.395
l'll try to enhance it.

44:15.464 --> 44:18.399
...l just struck gold.
So, you'll take care of that, right?

44:18.768 --> 44:22.067
-Sounds like a bell.
-Or a buoy.

44:22.838 --> 44:24.465
Those are the shipping lanes.

44:33.583 --> 44:36.051
No wonder the police can't find him
on the coast.

44:36.185 --> 44:36.879
Why?

44:37.253 --> 44:40.689
He's five miles offshore,
in the middle of the ocean.

44:41.991 --> 44:44.050
There's an abandoned oil derrick out there.

44:59.375 --> 45:02.970
-Miss Gordon, we're ready to begin.
-Well, l'm not.

45:03.479 --> 45:05.276
l'm afraid you have no choice.

45:16.058 --> 45:16.854
Grab her!

45:19.829 --> 45:20.659
No!

45:21.197 --> 45:22.255
Hold her legs.

45:32.975 --> 45:36.172
Pardon me, but l've just completed
the research on this list...

45:36.245 --> 45:38.509
...and l've found something
rather disturbing.

45:38.581 --> 45:39.479
What is it?

45:39.548 --> 45:43.712
lt seems these are surgical supplies
used in an allograft procedure.

45:44.620 --> 45:45.644
Oh, no.

45:46.555 --> 45:47.487
What is it?

45:47.556 --> 45:49.922
lt's the medical term
for an organ transplant.

45:50.526 --> 45:51.220
What?

45:52.061 --> 45:53.551
l think you'd better hurry.

46:14.116 --> 46:16.641
You're hurting me. Let me go.

46:22.825 --> 46:23.951
Get her inside.

46:28.264 --> 46:29.663
Let me go!

46:30.299 --> 46:33.097
Put her on the table.
l'll get the anesthesia.

46:38.074 --> 46:40.838
You don't need to put me under
for a blood transfusion.

46:43.245 --> 46:44.940
lt's more than that, isn't it?

46:46.482 --> 46:47.312
Hold her.

46:50.619 --> 46:52.280
You promised not to hurt her!

46:52.488 --> 46:53.955
Koonak, get out of here.

46:55.691 --> 46:56.589
Stop it!

46:58.928 --> 47:00.088
Get away!

47:05.501 --> 47:07.492
Nora! No! No!

47:26.856 --> 47:28.118
l'll get her back.

47:39.335 --> 47:40.324
Look, there.

47:55.317 --> 47:56.807
Someone's there, all right.

47:58.087 --> 48:00.419
Wait a minute. l see something.

48:01.590 --> 48:02.716
There's Barbara!

48:04.326 --> 48:05.850
-Hurry!
-Hang on.

48:36.992 --> 48:39.483
Stop shooting, you idiot!
These are fuel tanks.

48:39.895 --> 48:41.362
Come down, now!

49:30.579 --> 49:31.671
Up here!

49:32.448 --> 49:33.574
Are you all right?

50:26.569 --> 50:28.366
lt's okay. l got her!

51:01.036 --> 51:01.764
Wait.

51:02.938 --> 51:03.666
Wait.

51:04.974 --> 51:05.736
Now!

51:28.297 --> 51:29.321
Help!

51:31.800 --> 51:32.858
Over there!

51:38.807 --> 51:40.138
Shoot me a line!

51:41.977 --> 51:43.001
Stand back.

51:46.515 --> 51:47.447
Hurry!

51:52.988 --> 51:53.750
You!

51:55.290 --> 51:56.086
Look out!

52:25.387 --> 52:26.411
Barbara!

52:41.136 --> 52:43.627
-We got to get out of here!
-l'm working on it.

52:57.886 --> 53:01.378
She's behind the generators, over there!
You go that way!

53:01.690 --> 53:05.683
-Are you crazy? There's no way now.
-We're going to finish this!

53:06.028 --> 53:08.826
You're insane!
This place is going to blow any minute!

53:08.931 --> 53:10.057
We got to get out.

53:11.333 --> 53:14.632
We're not leaving
until you perform that operation.

53:21.677 --> 53:22.473
Look out!

53:36.391 --> 53:38.484
Gregory, help me!

53:55.244 --> 53:56.302
Brace yourself!

54:13.495 --> 54:15.019
My leg is broken.

54:32.080 --> 54:35.641
-Come on. Let's get out of here.
-No! Not without Nora.

54:36.285 --> 54:38.185
-Where is she?
-Down below.

54:38.320 --> 54:40.880
There's a boy there, too.
Come on, this way!

54:43.892 --> 54:44.950
There's no way.

54:46.662 --> 54:47.560
Stand back.

54:58.073 --> 54:58.835
Hurry!

55:01.844 --> 55:04.813
-You stay here.
-You need me to show you where they are.

55:04.980 --> 55:07.642
She's right. Robin, get the Batwing ready.

55:07.883 --> 55:11.284
-lf this place starts to blow, get out.
-l won't leave without you.

55:11.653 --> 55:13.883
Go! We're running out of time.

55:24.867 --> 55:25.731
This way.

56:27.829 --> 56:29.592
Come on, big guy. l've got you.

56:49.251 --> 56:50.149
Freeze!

56:54.489 --> 56:56.582
-ls there another way out?
-The elevator.

57:21.717 --> 57:22.706
Oh, no.

57:42.804 --> 57:43.668
Let's go!

57:44.039 --> 57:47.167
Take them first.
You can come back for me.

58:28.950 --> 58:30.417
Let's go. Let's go!

58:31.787 --> 58:35.120
-lf l'm not back in time, go without me.
-What? Wait!

59:01.316 --> 59:02.146
Hold on.

59:10.225 --> 59:11.556
Freeze!

01:01:02.904 --> 01:01:05.896
Today's top news stories
come from Gotham City...

01:01:05.974 --> 01:01:08.943
...where local newscaster Summer Gleason
is standing by.

01:01:09.377 --> 01:01:12.369
ln a case that could herald a new era
in cryogenic medicine...

01:01:12.681 --> 01:01:15.616
...Nora Fries has been revived
from her frozen state...

01:01:15.684 --> 01:01:18.244
...and has undergone
a vital organ transplant.

01:01:18.553 --> 01:01:23.320
Nora Fries is the wife of Victor Fries,
who was killed two weeks ago...

01:01:23.391 --> 01:01:27.657
...when an offshore drilling platform
exploded and collapsed into the ocean.

01:01:28.096 --> 01:01:31.930
The transplant operation,
funded by the Waynetech Corporation...

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:35.128
...under the auspices of its CEO,
Mr. Bruce Wayne...

01:01:35.437 --> 01:01:39.771
...was today declared a resounding success
by doctor Lyle Johnston...

01:01:40.108 --> 01:01:42.440
...chief surgeon
at Gotham General Hospital.

01:01:42.611 --> 01:01:45.910
Mrs. Fries is reported to be resting
in stable condition.

01:01:46.748 --> 01:01:50.946
lronically, the cryogenic technology
invented by Nora's husband...

01:01:51.253 --> 01:01:54.689
...which tragically transformed him
into the criminal Mr. Freeze...

01:01:54.990 --> 01:01:58.289
...was credited by Dr. Johnston
as having saved her life.

01:01:58.693 --> 01:02:01.093
lt's a shame Victor Fries will never know.

01:02:02.364 --> 01:02:05.128
ln other news,
Gotham's mysterious defender...

01:02:05.200 --> 01:02:08.863
