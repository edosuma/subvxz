M_I_SForEver

04:24.592 --> 04:27.715
If you stop
moving, they can't see you.

06:29.405 --> 06:30.528
Tell us, you idiot!

06:33.015 --> 06:35.022
Everyone breaks at some point, Sol.

06:37.175 --> 06:39.075
We know your daughter's at the Cove.

06:40.095 --> 06:42.023
We wanna go there.

06:42.025 --> 06:44.338
Tell us before Lutheran kills you.

06:45.275 --> 06:47.548
And if he does, we're all screwed.

06:51.125 --> 06:53.403
We'll find it sometime, Sol!

06:53.405 --> 06:56.912
When I get my hands on your
girl. Oh, it's gonna be fun.

07:16.268 --> 07:18.768
I don't think it's really
safe to keep the fire.

07:20.785 --> 07:21.618
Really?

07:22.675 --> 07:26.303
I've had it going for a
couple days now.

07:26.305 --> 07:30.038
You know, it's an essential
part for a civilized society.

07:31.885 --> 07:34.728
Well, it's also a way for
the wanderers to find us.

07:37.245 --> 07:38.495
And it's how I found you.

07:39.895 --> 07:42.008
I've been watching you for two days.

07:43.505 --> 07:45.948
You're definitely pretty careless.

07:47.964 --> 07:49.558
This is uncomfortable.

07:50.935 --> 07:52.635
Were you watching me this morning?

07:54.013 --> 07:54.846
Yeah.

07:56.892 --> 07:58.173
Okay.

07:58.175 --> 08:01.093
I don't remember it being
particularly cold, but,

08:01.095 --> 08:03.394
you seemed to be having
a pretty good time.

08:08.075 --> 08:08.908
All right.

08:09.895 --> 08:11.858
Well, I guess it's time for bed.

08:12.775 --> 08:14.323
We'll keep the fire on for now,

08:14.325 --> 08:17.023
but we'll just take sleep shifts.

08:17.025 --> 08:20.033
Civilized world or not,
I'm still a gentleman,

08:20.035 --> 08:23.143
- so you can sleep first.
- Sounds good to me.

08:23.145 --> 08:25.295
I haven't had a good
night's sleep in days.

08:44.965 --> 08:46.785
What's your plan in all this?

08:49.135 --> 08:51.975
Are you going somewhere or are you...

08:55.845 --> 08:56.995
Just trying to survive?

09:03.562 --> 09:05.145
Put out the fire.

09:29.223 --> 09:30.840
If you can't tell us
how to get to the Cove,

09:30.842 --> 09:32.770
you aren't any use to us.

09:32.772 --> 09:35.803
We'll just feed you to
our little friend here.

09:35.805 --> 09:37.083
Tick.

09:37.085 --> 09:38.573
Tock.

09:38.575 --> 09:39.490
Tick.

09:40.515 --> 09:41.348
Tock.

09:42.532 --> 09:44.377
Tick.

09:44.379 --> 09:45.212
Tock.

09:51.110 --> 09:52.110
Untie him.

09:54.092 --> 09:55.349
I said,

09:55.351 --> 09:56.727
untie him.

10:20.495 --> 10:21.795
We'll find her, Solomon.

10:23.067 --> 10:23.900
And when I do...

11:04.865 --> 11:06.358
Tell me about the new world.

11:08.590 --> 11:10.740
It's beautiful, from
what I've been told.

11:12.685 --> 11:17.193
Green, beautiful water.
Clean, non-toxic food.

11:17.195 --> 11:19.095
The fish are living and growing again.

11:20.313 --> 11:21.468
They even have vegetables.

11:22.875 --> 11:24.638
And it's run by healthy people.

11:25.525 --> 11:27.138
The survivors, like us.

11:30.372 --> 11:32.133
This place sounds amazing.

11:32.135 --> 11:34.253
The oil refineries are opening back up,

11:34.255 --> 11:37.013
which means the government is rebuilding,

11:37.015 --> 11:40.748
and I am never trusting
the government again.

11:42.015 --> 11:45.358
So, the people at the Cove
seem like my kind of people.

11:46.385 --> 11:47.968
Are you sure they're like us?

11:51.612 --> 11:54.108
'Cause I've met some new people

11:55.345 --> 11:56.808
who weren't infected.

11:59.875 --> 12:00.708
They're not.

12:02.235 --> 12:03.068
They're scary.

12:05.045 --> 12:06.895
You really wanna know what I think?

12:08.205 --> 12:09.913
Fear of other people

12:09.915 --> 12:12.848
is what got us in this whole
mess in the first place.

12:17.495 --> 12:19.280
Let's find a boat.

12:19.282 --> 12:21.532
That's the plan.

12:46.205 --> 12:47.713
These pirates are
gonna get the best of us

12:47.715 --> 12:48.578
one day, Sam.

12:52.705 --> 12:55.223
Yeah, well,

12:55.225 --> 12:56.975
that's the way I wanna go, Solomon.

12:58.766 --> 12:59.599
You see...

13:01.605 --> 13:03.038
I figure I got options.

13:06.535 --> 13:07.448
Starve to death.

13:12.305 --> 13:13.458
Eaten by a creature.

13:16.605 --> 13:19.288
Have them damn pirates hang me out to dry.

13:22.525 --> 13:23.358
Or...

13:24.922 --> 13:27.229
Or I could just stroke myself until I die.

13:27.231 --> 13:29.133
Oh, god.

13:29.135 --> 13:31.003
Oh, god, Sam.

13:31.005 --> 13:34.816
That is a horrible option.

13:34.818 --> 13:35.968
And a horrible thought.

13:45.289 --> 13:47.206
I got no more family.

13:49.751 --> 13:51.601
I've likely seen enough of this life.

13:53.898 --> 13:55.213
Hell...

13:55.215 --> 13:57.515
Probably should've been
gone 10 years earlier.

13:59.785 --> 14:01.485
At least you've got that daughter.

14:06.035 --> 14:09.218
You know, one day she's
gonna want to see her daddy.

14:14.295 --> 14:15.795
She's just been through a lot.

14:25.785 --> 14:28.968
Well, I thank you for the drink.

14:32.235 --> 14:35.235
Figure it's the least you could
do, for me saving your life.

14:36.445 --> 14:37.378
Again.

14:41.683 --> 14:45.728
You know, you're the only
friend I've had all these years.

14:46.775 --> 14:48.878
Ever since this started.

14:56.255 --> 14:57.243
If I die tonight-

14:57.245 --> 14:59.348
- Sam, you are not dying any time soon.

15:00.312 --> 15:01.612
Yeah, well...

15:04.055 --> 15:05.418
That remains to be seen.

15:08.698 --> 15:10.873
But you gotta stop being so stubborn.

15:13.785 --> 15:16.148
You gotta go see that girl.

15:21.085 --> 15:23.428
You did the right thing.

15:30.367 --> 15:33.784
You don't wanna die an old drunk like me.

17:43.935 --> 17:48.935
Of course. AK-12s and 47s
are all I have left, dude.

17:49.235 --> 17:50.068
Yes.

17:51.105 --> 17:52.988
I can't spend my money fast enough.

17:54.455 --> 17:56.443
Look, now, is the government failin'?

17:56.445 --> 17:57.783
I'm having a hard time keeping

17:57.785 --> 17:59.928
militia groups like yours fed.

18:01.045 --> 18:02.413
Really?

18:02.415 --> 18:05.228
Why, you guys are really hungry
for the strong stuff, huh?

18:06.655 --> 18:09.588
Hey, my son is calling.
I better wrap, yeah.

18:10.745 --> 18:12.343
Tomorrow.

18:12.345 --> 18:13.178
Luther!

18:14.125 --> 18:16.898
So nice to hear from you!

18:16.900 --> 18:18.403
Good.

18:18.405 --> 18:19.833
Good.

18:19.835 --> 18:21.863
Well, what?

18:21.865 --> 18:24.193
No, the world is not
what it used to be, pal.

18:24.195 --> 18:26.523
But I'm making lots of money.

18:26.525 --> 18:27.998
Yeah, how are you?

18:28.905 --> 18:32.143
California with all the crazies, yeah.

18:32.145 --> 18:33.803
Are they still taking away all your rights

18:33.805 --> 18:35.398
every god damn day?

18:37.445 --> 18:38.573
Really?

18:38.575 --> 18:39.983
Please don't tell me
you were wearing a mask

18:39.985 --> 18:41.298
to eat in restaurants.

18:43.215 --> 18:44.778
Seriously? They're all closed?

18:45.735 --> 18:47.903
Well, what's anybody
gonna do to make money?

18:47.905 --> 18:49.493
That's gonna get crazy, son.

18:49.495 --> 18:52.183
I see mob violence in your future.

18:52.185 --> 18:57.185
Yes, with weapons, provided
by your daddy.

19:04.095 --> 19:05.986
I'm really glad you
called. I've missed you.

19:05.988 --> 19:08.174
Did you just put me on speaker?

19:08.176 --> 19:10.053
You sound
weird. What's goin' on?

19:10.055 --> 19:13.273
Well, a friend of mine
just walked in. You remember?

19:13.275 --> 19:15.153
Captain Ben Solomon.

19:15.155 --> 19:16.523
Ben Solomon?

19:16.525 --> 19:17.356
Solomon?

19:17.358 --> 19:19.386
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Dad, what the hell's going on?

19:19.388 --> 19:21.653
What the fuck is Ben Solomon doing there?

19:21.655 --> 19:23.123
Can I offer you a drink, Ben?

19:23.125 --> 19:23.973
What is going on?

19:23.975 --> 19:26.423
What the hell is going in there?

19:26.425 --> 19:28.532
Not like you to turn down a drink.

19:30.365 --> 19:32.313
Still on the
clock for one more minute.

19:32.315 --> 19:33.515
Ah, so I got a minute.

19:35.865 --> 19:37.183
Luther?

19:37.185 --> 19:38.235
Yeah, Dad?

19:40.875 --> 19:41.838
I love you, son.

19:44.045 --> 19:45.971
Luther, say
goodbye to your father.

19:45.973 --> 19:46.925
What?

19:46.927 --> 19:50.797
Wait, wait, wait, wait. What is going on?

22:55.412 --> 22:57.812
How are you
seasoned in all this shit?

22:59.595 --> 23:01.998
I mean I've been dealing with
this just as long as you have.

23:02.955 --> 23:05.748
Well, a tough upbringing.

23:06.665 --> 23:09.183
Many bad relationships.

23:09.185 --> 23:11.493
Amongst a list of other things.

23:11.495 --> 23:14.333
Well, there used to be a list.

23:14.335 --> 23:18.458
Now I'm just a loner, killing
anyone who gets near me.

23:19.385 --> 23:20.218
Except you.

23:21.385 --> 23:22.418
I will let you live.

23:23.905 --> 23:27.468
Thanks. I appreciate that.

23:28.535 --> 23:30.508
It's really quite
amazing out here, isn't it?

23:31.865 --> 23:33.136
Yeah.

23:33.138 --> 23:34.673
I don't think I ever
really appreciated this

23:34.675 --> 23:36.058
for what it was.

23:37.405 --> 23:39.305
And now we can't even go in the water.

23:40.845 --> 23:42.413
Why not?

23:42.415 --> 23:43.408
The toxins?

23:44.365 --> 23:45.998
Not to mention the sea lions.

23:47.775 --> 23:49.343
Sea lions?

23:49.345 --> 23:51.003
Yeah.

23:51.005 --> 23:52.683
They ate all the dead fish

23:52.685 --> 23:55.978
and got this weird type
of mad cow disease.

23:57.325 --> 24:00.453
What's worse is the people
that ate the dead fish.

24:00.455 --> 24:02.168
They also call them sea lions.

24:03.595 --> 24:06.595
They're like the creatures but
they only exist in the water.

24:10.215 --> 24:13.146
It's like God's taking his
wrath out on us, all at once.

24:13.148 --> 24:14.593
"God."

24:14.595 --> 24:18.037
Oh, my god, you believe
in God? That's a good one.

24:45.086 --> 24:46.596
- Cookie.
- Hang on!

24:46.598 --> 24:48.063
Cookie, Cookie. Open up, bud.

24:48.065 --> 24:49.138
Yeah, yeah.

24:51.617 --> 24:52.534
Come on in.

24:56.694 --> 24:58.573
What you got there?

24:58.575 --> 24:59.975
Stuff, buddy. I got stuff.

25:01.614 --> 25:02.697
Look at this.

25:10.248 --> 25:14.253
I think you're getting close, my friend.

25:14.255 --> 25:16.722
So do I.

25:16.724 --> 25:17.563
As soon as we get her running,

25:17.565 --> 25:21.013
we'll be able to get out there
and get fresh fish so easy.

25:21.015 --> 25:23.763
You are so stupid.

25:23.765 --> 25:26.663
Get the boat running so
you can get to the Cove.

25:26.665 --> 25:28.128
Get the hell out of here!

25:29.545 --> 25:32.813
Make peace with your daughter.
Find yourself a new woman.

25:32.815 --> 25:35.066
That's what I'm telling you.

25:48.882 --> 25:52.158
Before I go, I forgot
I made a fresh batch.

25:53.245 --> 25:54.078
Enjoy.

25:55.145 --> 25:59.013
You are so good to me.

25:59.015 --> 25:59.978
Hey, be careful.

26:01.125 --> 26:01.958
I will.

26:04.837 --> 26:05.670
Ah!

26:35.375 --> 26:38.248
Well, you're a sight for sore eyes.

26:40.875 --> 26:43.113
Been waiting for you my entire life!

26:43.115 --> 26:44.015
Leave her alone.

26:44.945 --> 26:46.063
What makes you think he's
even talking about her?

26:46.065 --> 26:47.615
You scraggly little bitch. Huh?

27:17.925 --> 27:19.508
Let him go.

27:28.680 --> 27:30.700
What a shame.

27:30.702 --> 27:32.052
We could've all shared her.

27:35.785 --> 27:36.618
Solomon.

27:42.269 --> 27:43.718
Oh.

27:46.105 --> 27:47.125
Your daughter...

27:48.925 --> 27:49.928
She's next.

27:55.275 --> 27:56.106
You do realize you
have to get through me

27:56.108 --> 27:57.638
to get to my daughter?

27:59.975 --> 28:01.025
An eye...

28:02.675 --> 28:03.518
For an eye.

28:55.418 --> 28:57.990
What're you doing?

28:57.992 --> 28:58.992
Are you burning her?

29:00.475 --> 29:03.052
This will just keep the
wanderers from devouring her.

29:56.722 --> 29:59.972
Come down here. It's not safe up there.

30:59.665 --> 31:01.123
You can stay the night, but,

31:01.125 --> 31:03.958
after we bury your girlfriend
tomorrow, you have to leave.

31:14.035 --> 31:15.745
She wasn't my girlfriend.

31:24.190 --> 31:25.023
Sister?

31:31.355 --> 31:32.741
No.

31:32.743 --> 31:36.022
She was...

31:36.024 --> 31:37.857
She was just a friend.

32:32.808 --> 32:34.891
Are you gonna eat that?

32:42.885 --> 32:44.735
It doesn't really matter who she was.

32:46.125 --> 32:47.775
The point is you can't stay here.

32:50.075 --> 32:52.625
You're not my kid and you're
not my responsibility.

33:04.560 --> 33:07.663
I'm going to bed. I
suggest you go to bed, too.

33:07.665 --> 33:08.518
Get some sleep.

34:23.755 --> 34:25.688
Cody, what did you do today?

34:27.344 --> 34:28.592
Absolutely nothin'.

34:28.594 --> 34:30.208
Mm. Shane, what did you do?

34:32.475 --> 34:34.283
Same as Cody.

34:34.284 --> 34:36.983
You did nothing? Good, good.

34:36.985 --> 34:38.947
Dolph, what did you do?

34:40.114 --> 34:41.523
Practiced throwing knives all day.

34:41.525 --> 34:44.152
Very, very good. Why didn't
you practice throwing knives?

34:44.155 --> 34:45.467
It comes very useful.

34:46.775 --> 34:48.203
God damn, it feels like I'm surrounded

34:48.205 --> 34:50.197
by the fucking Village People in here.

34:51.538 --> 34:55.303
Well, gentlemen,
it would seem that

34:55.304 --> 34:59.883
more and more people are making their way

34:59.885 --> 35:02.005
to our little piece

35:02.985 --> 35:04.773
of the world.

35:04.775 --> 35:06.933
Yeah, I wonder why.

35:06.935 --> 35:08.777
Because it's utopia here.

35:11.055 --> 35:11.888
Utopia?

35:16.425 --> 35:19.153
Is it utopia here, Dolph?

35:19.155 --> 35:19.986
Yeah?

35:19.988 --> 35:22.663
With their multicolored rainbows and, uh,

35:22.665 --> 35:25.868
unicorns that give BJs here, no?

35:27.015 --> 35:29.373
- No.
- No, there's not.

35:29.375 --> 35:34.375
This place is a warring fire of shit.

35:34.975 --> 35:36.283
Do you smell that right now?

35:36.285 --> 35:37.943
You know what the smell of that is?

35:37.945 --> 35:41.923
That is the smell of
shit and rotting flesh,

35:41.925 --> 35:43.793
because that is the only thing

35:43.795 --> 35:47.378
that this motherfucking
marina fucking has.

35:48.223 --> 35:50.863
And if you looked up
shit in the dictionary,

35:50.865 --> 35:52.643
first off, it would be
a picture of you, Shane,

35:52.645 --> 35:54.583
but right next to it would be a picture

35:54.585 --> 35:55.978
of this fucking marina!

35:57.903 --> 35:59.208
More importantly,

36:00.875 --> 36:03.040
the refinery's opening back up.

36:03.042 --> 36:05.261
- You know what that means?
- What?

36:05.263 --> 36:09.452
It means that the fuckin'
government is comin' back.

36:10.698 --> 36:11.703
Yeah.

36:11.705 --> 36:13.553
Party's over.

36:13.555 --> 36:17.853
As there's a lot of them
and there's only five of us.

36:17.855 --> 36:20.003
Look, we need to get to the Cove,

36:20.005 --> 36:21.505
and we need to get there fast.

36:23.585 --> 36:26.943
Not to mention, if that girl
was a friend of Solomon's,

36:26.945 --> 36:28.645
he ain't gonna let us off so easy.

36:29.945 --> 36:33.247
I'm not sure I liked your
tone just there, Shane.

36:33.249 --> 36:38.043
'Cause, it sounded
to me like you were implying

36:38.045 --> 36:40.793
that I should be worried about Solomon.

36:40.795 --> 36:42.036
Is that what you were implying?

36:42.038 --> 36:45.727
I am suggesting that perhaps
we should all be concerned

36:45.729 --> 36:47.453
about Solomon, yes.

36:47.455 --> 36:49.823
- Could be trouble.
- "Could be trouble."

36:49.825 --> 36:50.658
Hm.

36:51.995 --> 36:54.053
Let me tell you something.

36:54.055 --> 36:57.883
I'm not worried about fucking Chewbacca

36:57.885 --> 37:02.783
with his god damn crossbow
playing around on his boat.

37:02.785 --> 37:04.933
That doesn't concern me, Shane.

37:04.935 --> 37:08.088
Do you think that it
should concern me, huh?

37:10.455 --> 37:12.413
Might wanna be concerned
is all I'm sayin'.

37:12.415 --> 37:14.113
Oh, yeah? Let's go be concerned.

37:14.115 --> 37:16.323
Let's go stop at his
boat and go steal some

37:16.325 --> 37:19.968
of his vegetables so he
can't have a salad tomorrow.

37:28.712 --> 37:31.088
You know, fuck that!

39:19.015 --> 39:20.343
If I can find you some string,

39:20.345 --> 39:21.895
we can make her a proper cross.

39:23.185 --> 39:24.385
No, this stuff's fine.

39:26.485 --> 39:27.318
Are you sure?

39:31.955 --> 39:33.355
She didn't believe in God.

39:35.095 --> 39:35.928
Well...

39:37.245 --> 39:39.173
Finish up here and then I'm
gonna get you to the boat

39:39.175 --> 39:40.408
so you can pack up.

40:30.398 --> 40:33.398
Who are the guys that attacked us?

40:38.485 --> 40:41.348
They were soldiers and then
they became the resistance.

40:42.965 --> 40:46.213
They were the equivalent of
what you'd remember as bad cops.

40:46.215 --> 40:49.103
The kind of guys who would shoot first

40:49.105 --> 40:51.253
and then ask questions later.

40:51.255 --> 40:52.933
I was one of 'em.

40:52.935 --> 40:56.143
We were hired by the government
and we worked under the CIA.

40:56.145 --> 40:57.463
It was back in the time when

40:57.465 --> 40:59.615
we used to work together
to try to survive.

41:00.485 --> 41:01.735
But then they got greedy.

41:02.805 --> 41:04.305
They left their morals behind.

41:05.165 --> 41:06.165
How many are they?

41:07.335 --> 41:09.518
There's about five more of them left.

41:10.915 --> 41:13.758
And I would guess about
30 million wanderers.

41:15.485 --> 41:17.793
Well, where are the rest
of the good guys, then?

41:17.795 --> 41:20.053
How many soldiers do you have?

41:20.055 --> 41:22.128
Well, you're looking at 50% of my men.

41:25.885 --> 41:26.718
Well, shit.

41:28.685 --> 41:30.813
Our odds don't look that great.

41:30.815 --> 41:33.615
That's 'cause you haven't
met the other 50% of my men.

41:34.925 --> 41:38.178
Your usage of math
and comedy are horrible.

41:39.985 --> 41:42.043
I didn't ask you to come here.

41:42.045 --> 41:42.878
Well...

41:45.565 --> 41:46.943
Don't you think it would be better

41:46.945 --> 41:50.263
if I stayed here and helped?

41:50.265 --> 41:53.073
We could like join forces or something.

41:53.075 --> 41:54.653
No, from what I've seen so far,

41:54.655 --> 41:56.455
you'd just be another mouth to feed.

43:03.795 --> 43:05.345
I wish you'd stop following me.

43:08.655 --> 43:11.198
- I've nowhere else to go.
- That's not my problem.

43:13.215 --> 43:14.723
Why are you such an asshole?

43:14.725 --> 43:16.723
Why are you such a little baby?

43:16.725 --> 43:19.013
Because everything in your
life's been handed to you?

43:19.015 --> 43:21.273
Because you can't Google
your way out of this?

43:21.275 --> 43:24.403
Look, I'm really sorry about
what happened to your friend,

43:24.405 --> 43:27.943
but you're not my responsibility.

43:27.945 --> 43:29.088
Go find your family.

43:35.015 --> 43:35.978
My family's dead.

43:37.566 --> 43:38.578
I have no one else.

43:41.895 --> 43:42.745
Not my problem.

44:03.425 --> 44:04.280
Fuck.

44:04.282 --> 44:06.683
Can I please stay with you?

44:06.685 --> 44:08.746
That is a good way
to get yourself killed.

44:20.885 --> 44:21.985
Don't worry, I got it.

44:23.755 --> 44:24.588
Look at me.

44:26.125 --> 44:27.528
I don't eat much.

44:28.521 --> 44:29.621
You know, I'm gonna...

44:30.835 --> 44:32.035
I'm gonna die out there.

44:32.945 --> 44:34.348
I can barely defend myself.

44:36.162 --> 44:37.143
Look.

44:37.145 --> 44:39.845
I just don't see any advantages
of keeping you around.

44:40.805 --> 44:41.733
In fact, if I do,

44:41.735 --> 44:43.971
you're just gonna be an
easy target for Luther.

44:45.375 --> 44:46.325
Yeah, that sucks.

44:51.075 --> 44:52.893
Look, just keep walkin'.

44:52.895 --> 44:54.873
I'm sure you'll run into
friendly people sooner or later.

44:54.875 --> 44:56.963
You can't just leave
me for the wolves here.

44:56.965 --> 44:58.503
I'm not.

44:58.505 --> 45:00.433
You came here on your own.

45:00.435 --> 45:04.018
I just don't want you staying
with me. You're a handicap.

45:08.935 --> 45:10.978
Actually, I've got an idea.

45:14.875 --> 45:16.353
You ever use one of these?

45:16.355 --> 45:18.088
- Yeah.
- I'm gonna let you use it.

45:19.505 --> 45:21.355
Come on. Help me get this outta here.

45:36.995 --> 45:39.395
So did you and that girl
have some sort of plan?

45:40.559 --> 45:41.598
Yeah.

45:42.811 --> 45:46.308
We wanted to get to
the ocean, find a boat.

45:48.195 --> 45:49.533
Go to this place called the Cove.

45:49.535 --> 45:52.403
Oh, the miraculous Cove.

45:52.405 --> 45:54.043
The place with all the
young, healthy people.

45:54.045 --> 45:55.299
You know about it?

46:11.205 --> 46:13.023
Is this just what you do all day?

46:13.025 --> 46:13.858
Pretty much.

46:15.785 --> 46:18.293
But today's Tuesday.

46:18.295 --> 46:20.659
We're actually gonna do some entertaining.

46:22.565 --> 46:23.396
What's so funny?

46:23.398 --> 46:25.473
How do you just know what day it is?

46:25.475 --> 46:26.823
Why would that even matter?

46:26.825 --> 46:28.793
It's very important to run a calendar.

46:28.795 --> 46:30.713
Plus, I wanted to invite you,

46:30.715 --> 46:32.881
so that you can meet your new roommate.

47:07.305 --> 47:09.410
Taco Tuesday, baby!

47:10.865 --> 47:11.978
Sam, this is Cairo.

47:13.292 --> 47:14.988
Cairo, this is my friend Sam.

47:19.235 --> 47:21.485
Shake my hand like a
god damn man, will ya?

47:22.785 --> 47:25.513
Cairo, we've got
much bigger fish to fry

47:25.515 --> 47:27.228
than worrying about Sam's germs.

47:29.355 --> 47:30.888
- Nice to meet you.
- Yeah.

47:36.965 --> 47:37.798
So...

47:39.445 --> 47:40.545
What's your deal, kid?

47:41.452 --> 47:45.428
Are you just passing
through or are you lost?

47:48.332 --> 47:49.165
I'd say both.

47:52.310 --> 47:53.660
Don't know where I'm going.

47:57.700 --> 48:01.273
A friend and I are trying
to find a boat, though.

48:01.275 --> 48:02.128
Get to the Cove.

48:03.135 --> 48:03.968
Ah!

48:05.515 --> 48:08.408
That's the place with
those healthy young people.

48:09.955 --> 48:12.798
Well, I can't say as though I blame you.

48:14.750 --> 48:15.600
I don't blame ya.

48:16.715 --> 48:19.015
- Take this idiot with you.
- Here we go again.

48:21.245 --> 48:22.078
What?

48:24.715 --> 48:25.546
What is it?

48:25.548 --> 48:27.553
This old man doesn't
have any friends, so,

48:27.555 --> 48:29.805
I don't know why he
always wants me to leave.

48:31.525 --> 48:34.906
Besides, Sam, if I leave,
who's gonna take care of you?

48:38.915 --> 48:41.773
His daughter's at
the Cove and apparently

48:41.775 --> 48:45.498
she's one of the gatekeepers,
second behind the Queen bee.

48:49.933 --> 48:52.298
Oh, my god.

48:54.155 --> 48:55.416
Why the hell would you stay here?

48:55.418 --> 48:57.643
I don't have a boat
that can make the trip.

48:57.645 --> 48:59.933
You and I both know you could get a boat

48:59.935 --> 49:01.913
running in a matter of days.

49:01.915 --> 49:04.388
Let's just drop it and eat.

49:09.255 --> 49:10.088
Wow!

49:12.335 --> 49:15.493
Are you trying to show off for
the kid? This is really good!

49:15.495 --> 49:16.645
Why, thank you.

49:18.738 --> 49:20.738
Hm. Well, here's to new friends.

49:25.810 --> 49:28.503
Well...

49:28.505 --> 49:29.755
I can tell you one thing.

49:31.105 --> 49:32.408
You're lucky he found you.

49:37.305 --> 49:39.268
Yeah, I'd be dead for sure.

49:43.425 --> 49:45.108
- I assume you know him?
- Yeah.

49:46.395 --> 49:47.228
Yeah.

49:48.115 --> 49:50.928
Solomon lead them and I lead Solomon.

49:53.381 --> 49:56.082
And there was one psycho,
his name is Luther.

50:00.085 --> 50:01.778
Yeah, he killed my friend.

50:04.845 --> 50:05.985
Yeah, it was...

50:08.815 --> 50:10.408
It was in the recent past.

50:12.875 --> 50:13.838
Seems so long ago.

50:16.775 --> 50:17.608
Some of them,

50:19.165 --> 50:20.558
they just got too evil.

50:21.955 --> 50:24.118
They did some really bad things.

50:26.325 --> 50:27.598
They abused their power.

50:28.935 --> 50:32.488
Well, Uncle Sam gets in
contact with Solomon,

50:33.505 --> 50:38.498
Solomon takes out Luther's
father, James Kurtzman.

50:40.865 --> 50:41.718
Solomon.

50:44.465 --> 50:46.928
He probably killed 30.

50:47.815 --> 50:49.793
30 of them.

50:49.795 --> 50:50.898
In self defense.

50:53.050 --> 50:54.953
Not half as many as I did.

50:54.955 --> 50:56.405
But you know, who's counting?

50:59.845 --> 51:03.193
So now, we...

51:03.195 --> 51:05.708
We coexist as best we can.

51:07.275 --> 51:08.108
For now.

51:14.445 --> 51:17.498
I'm thinking you probably
need a place to stay.

51:21.215 --> 51:22.046
Yeah.

51:22.048 --> 51:24.363
Yeah, well, you can crash at my place,

51:24.365 --> 51:26.588
till you figure out what's best for you.

51:28.265 --> 51:30.365
I know Solomon's gonna need some solitude.

51:33.455 --> 51:35.053
Why is that?

51:35.055 --> 51:35.888
Well...

51:37.015 --> 51:37.948
Like I said.

51:39.135 --> 51:42.658
He killed a good 30 of them
that I seen with my own eyes.

51:45.125 --> 51:47.783
And, you know, he thought
by now he'd be retired

51:47.785 --> 51:50.285
and living in the Keys
with his wife and daughter.

51:53.655 --> 51:54.918
And he killed his wife.

51:56.345 --> 51:57.472
And it changed him.

52:01.933 --> 52:03.343
What the hell?

52:03.345 --> 52:05.243
He didn't murder her.

52:05.245 --> 52:08.563
She got infected. He had no choice.

52:08.565 --> 52:11.065
If he didn't kill her,
she'd attack him and Amber.

52:12.870 --> 52:14.763
Amber's his daughter?

52:14.765 --> 52:15.598
Yeah.

52:16.795 --> 52:18.228
She didn't take it too well.

52:20.415 --> 52:23.578
She left and said she never
wanted to see him again.

52:25.705 --> 52:28.225
Then she met others and

52:30.304 --> 52:32.104
they've been at the Cove ever since.

52:35.585 --> 52:37.298
From what we've been hearing, anyway.

52:38.165 --> 52:40.043
Thanks for letting
him crash with you, Sam.

52:40.045 --> 52:43.800
Shit, Solomon! You almost
gave me a heart attack!

52:46.555 --> 52:50.033
Yes, I'd be happy to host him
until you get the boat fixed

52:50.035 --> 52:51.285
and take him to the Cove.

52:52.395 --> 52:55.783
Not happenin'. Now why
don't you two get outta here?

52:55.785 --> 52:57.405
So I can get some rest.

52:57.407 --> 52:59.593
Sounds good to me.

52:59.595 --> 53:01.733
Taco Tuesdays without any tacos?

53:01.735 --> 53:03.285
It always gets me really drunk!

53:04.235 --> 53:06.093
Get him out of here before he passes out

53:06.095 --> 53:08.203
and you both end up staying here.

53:08.205 --> 53:09.628
That's the last thing I need.

53:16.035 --> 53:16.868
Shit.

53:20.625 --> 53:23.438
Taco Tuesday.

53:27.300 --> 53:28.945
Oh, god.

53:33.100 --> 53:34.100
Get in here.

53:35.991 --> 53:37.658
Light these candles.

53:46.581 --> 53:50.764
Fuck.

53:54.427 --> 53:55.260
Ah!

53:56.285 --> 53:57.118
All right.

53:58.825 --> 54:03.825
There! Now, I'm lookin'
pretty good, huh?

54:53.069 --> 54:55.835
Oh, god. Why does my head hurt?

55:08.558 --> 55:11.236
Good evening, gentlemen.

55:15.418 --> 55:17.345
Now, did I miss...

55:18.345 --> 55:19.505
Taco Tuesday?

56:27.681 --> 56:29.181
Do you wanna live?

56:35.990 --> 56:36.823
I said...

56:38.950 --> 56:39.783
Do you

56:41.012 --> 56:41.845
want to

56:43.566 --> 56:44.399
live?

56:54.368 --> 56:55.451
Fuck, fuck.

57:05.930 --> 57:08.280
Ah!

57:08.282 --> 57:09.115
God.

57:10.435 --> 57:11.735
I'm gonna make you a deal.

57:18.905 --> 57:21.415
I'm gonna make you a deal with

57:25.900 --> 57:26.983
four options.

57:30.215 --> 57:31.958
Are you ready to hear option one?

57:35.235 --> 57:37.288
Option one.

57:43.070 --> 57:43.903
We blow

57:45.125 --> 57:46.275
your brains out

57:47.529 --> 57:48.362
right

57:49.550 --> 57:50.383
now.

57:51.857 --> 57:52.690
Bang!

58:26.772 --> 58:28.795
You don't like that option, do you?

58:33.775 --> 58:34.715
Option two is...

58:38.939 --> 58:39.856
Here we go.

58:43.951 --> 58:44.784
You

58:45.955 --> 58:47.402
blow your own brains out.

58:56.535 --> 58:58.553
Um, I'm gonna go out on a limb here

58:58.555 --> 59:01.418
and guess that you don't
like that option either.

59:03.245 --> 59:05.963
Well, there is a third
option.

59:05.965 --> 59:06.798
Take the gun.

59:08.350 --> 59:10.208
Yeah, there we go. Take it.

59:11.070 --> 59:13.020
Just point it that way.

59:13.925 --> 59:15.195
Third option is...

59:16.915 --> 59:20.273
You shoot one of us.

59:20.275 --> 59:21.108
Me.

59:22.918 --> 59:23.918
Or that guy.

59:27.722 --> 59:30.363
It's risky, you know.

59:30.365 --> 59:33.897
Maybe we die.

59:33.899 --> 59:34.982
Then again...

59:37.165 --> 59:38.238
Maybe we don't.

59:44.270 --> 59:45.770
What happens then?

59:47.275 --> 59:48.675
Well, my guess would be that

59:50.525 --> 59:53.388
whoever doesn't die between
me and this guy here,

59:56.055 --> 59:58.338
he'd probably be pretty upset.

59:59.465 --> 01:00:04.465
Probably gonna torture you.

01:00:04.855 --> 01:00:06.335
More vividly

01:00:07.368 --> 01:00:08.535
and creatively

01:00:09.689 --> 01:00:14.689
than anything you could ever imagine.

01:00:58.255 --> 01:00:59.789
There is a fourth option, though.

01:00:59.791 --> 01:01:01.868
Get this shit over with so we can go.

01:01:03.015 --> 01:01:04.218
Option four.

01:01:05.231 --> 01:01:07.631
It's a little
complicated and comes with

01:01:08.522 --> 01:01:09.923
a condition or two.

01:01:09.925 --> 01:01:14.593
You take this gun here, and
hold it with both hands.

01:01:14.595 --> 01:01:15.495
Yeah, that's good.

01:01:16.373 --> 01:01:17.578
You take this gun,

01:01:18.870 --> 01:01:22.218
and you march off this boat
and you go down the dock,

01:01:23.415 --> 01:01:24.715
and you find

01:01:26.505 --> 01:01:28.028
Solomon's boat.

01:01:29.111 --> 01:01:29.944
Hm?

01:01:31.075 --> 01:01:35.178
And you walk up to Mr. Solomon,

01:01:36.613 --> 01:01:41.168
you point your gun at the
back of his curly, bushy head,

01:01:42.895 --> 01:01:44.429
and you go...

01:01:46.845 --> 01:01:48.893
Yeah. Oh!

01:01:48.895 --> 01:01:50.183
Wait, I got ahead of myself.

01:01:50.185 --> 01:01:53.333
No, before you shoot Solomon,
it's really, really important,

01:01:53.335 --> 01:01:55.983
in fact, it's super fucking important

01:01:55.985 --> 01:01:58.993
that you find out where
the god damn Cove is,

01:01:58.995 --> 01:02:02.253
because for some fucking reason,

01:02:02.255 --> 01:02:05.629
that imbecile knows where the Cove is,

01:02:05.631 --> 01:02:07.381
and no one else does!

01:02:08.693 --> 01:02:09.526
So...

01:02:10.495 --> 01:02:11.328
Please.

01:02:12.225 --> 01:02:15.043
Just find out from him

01:02:15.045 --> 01:02:18.718
where the Cove is, because
well, the thing is,

01:02:19.655 --> 01:02:22.668
me and my friends really
wanna go.

01:02:22.670 --> 01:02:23.983
You know what I mean?

01:02:23.985 --> 01:02:27.323
So, you find out where
the Cove is, and uh,

01:02:27.325 --> 01:02:30.223
then you shoot him, and
then, well,

01:02:30.225 --> 01:02:34.192
you come back here to meet
us, and we'll give you...

01:02:36.745 --> 01:02:37.578
One day.

01:02:38.645 --> 01:02:41.303
Yeah, that'll be enough time.

01:02:41.305 --> 01:02:43.898
Say, let's meet back here,

01:02:45.055 --> 01:02:47.388
um, this time tomorrow.

01:02:48.935 --> 01:02:49.768
Okay?

01:02:50.885 --> 01:02:52.213
It's gonna be great.

01:02:52.215 --> 01:02:53.653
You're gonna come back,

01:02:53.655 --> 01:02:55.833
you're gonna tell us where the Cove is,

01:02:55.835 --> 01:02:56.975
and we're gonna...

01:02:58.565 --> 01:02:59.915
We're gonna take you there.

01:03:00.985 --> 01:03:05.108
On a magical fucking dolphin,
we're gonna go to the Cove!

01:03:09.103 --> 01:03:10.763
I think he's got it.

01:03:10.765 --> 01:03:12.400
All right, so I'm gonna
give you the gun now

01:03:12.402 --> 01:03:15.433
and I'm gonna leave, but don't shoot me,

01:03:15.435 --> 01:03:17.843
because we already talked
about option three,

01:03:17.845 --> 01:03:20.258
and that
can get a little weird.

01:03:21.895 --> 01:03:24.788
There you go. Just gonna
nestle it right in there.

01:03:25.845 --> 01:03:26.678
There we go.

01:03:27.634 --> 01:03:28.941
All right, yep.

01:03:28.943 --> 01:03:31.823
No, don't put your finger
on the booger trigger.

01:03:31.825 --> 01:03:34.098
Yeah, just... Yep, there we go, okay.

01:03:39.635 --> 01:03:40.578
Is that lavender?

01:03:41.674 --> 01:03:42.507
It's nice.

01:03:50.435 --> 01:03:51.865
Oh, just...

01:03:53.185 --> 01:03:54.018
One thing.

01:03:56.075 --> 01:03:58.655
The last man that betrayed me...

01:04:03.375 --> 01:04:04.208
I ate him.

01:04:07.175 --> 01:04:09.598
So, don't betray us.

01:04:10.675 --> 01:04:11.918
Okay, cupcake?

01:04:13.135 --> 01:04:14.218
Bye bye, now.

01:04:48.565 --> 01:04:49.734
Sam.

01:04:52.136 --> 01:04:52.969
Sam!

01:05:28.617 --> 01:05:30.700
Cairo, what's going on?

01:05:45.516 --> 01:05:48.394
Fuck.

01:05:49.525 --> 01:05:50.888
Why didn't you come get me?

01:05:57.825 --> 01:05:59.318
It all happened so fast.

01:06:03.145 --> 01:06:04.428
Luther ambushed us.

01:06:05.795 --> 01:06:06.788
Strangled Sam.

01:06:09.905 --> 01:06:11.565
Luther just let me live.

01:06:14.695 --> 01:06:16.245
You couldn't have helped him?

01:06:21.096 --> 01:06:22.713
I knew I should've made
you guys stay with me.

01:06:22.715 --> 01:06:24.358
He had way too much to drink.

01:06:29.285 --> 01:06:30.635
And you're fuckin' useless.

01:06:51.575 --> 01:06:52.675
They attacked me, too.

01:06:54.575 --> 01:06:56.075
They must've been watching us.

01:07:00.785 --> 01:07:02.215
There was only one, but...

01:07:04.415 --> 01:07:06.123
He climbed aboard right
after you guys left

01:07:06.125 --> 01:07:06.975
and I killed him.

01:07:09.295 --> 01:07:11.795
I knew they would come on
strong, sooner or later.

01:07:14.425 --> 01:07:16.188
This is something I can't fix.

01:07:20.515 --> 01:07:22.493
We gotta get
the fuck outta here.

01:07:22.495 --> 01:07:23.498
And go where?

01:07:25.145 --> 01:07:26.095
Anywhere.

01:07:28.435 --> 01:07:29.378
The Cove.

01:07:30.785 --> 01:07:33.323
Like Sam said, go and start a new life.

01:07:33.325 --> 01:07:36.065
This is my life, Cairo. I'm fine here.

01:07:37.469 --> 01:07:38.636
You're fine.

01:07:40.325 --> 01:07:42.338
There's nothing here.

01:07:43.205 --> 01:07:44.158
Nothing.

01:07:46.925 --> 01:07:49.408
You can't fight everyone.

01:07:51.005 --> 01:07:52.998
Someone will beat you, eventually.

01:07:56.595 --> 01:08:00.063
If I'm not mistaken, there's
only four pirates left.

01:08:00.065 --> 01:08:02.018
Luther and three others.

01:08:03.145 --> 01:08:05.373
So I think my odds of
surviving are pretty good.

01:08:05.375 --> 01:08:07.475
More wanderers come down here every day.

01:08:09.085 --> 01:08:09.983
The virus is spreading,

01:08:09.985 --> 01:08:13.028
and you can't kill 30 million
wanderers and sea lions.

01:08:14.135 --> 01:08:16.923
The government, they're just
gonna throw you into a camp.

01:08:16.925 --> 01:08:19.872
You've been way too
exposed living out here.

01:08:19.875 --> 01:08:22.075
And the refinery's
almost fully operational.

01:08:22.955 --> 01:08:24.755
Sooner or later, your little harbor,

01:08:25.955 --> 01:08:27.104
it's gonna get overrun.

01:08:28.645 --> 01:08:31.425
No. I'm not going to the Cove.

01:08:42.457 --> 01:08:47.457
Come on, help me get him.

01:10:05.751 --> 01:10:07.918
You want something to eat?

01:10:09.102 --> 01:10:10.108
I'm fine, thanks.

01:10:11.425 --> 01:10:13.375
Wouldn't want to use up all your stuff.

01:10:14.695 --> 01:10:16.278
Okay, suit yourself.

01:11:22.905 --> 01:11:24.755
Whatever anger you are feeling

01:11:26.635 --> 01:11:28.558
has been replaced by shame.

01:11:31.605 --> 01:11:32.438
Go to him.

01:11:34.775 --> 01:11:37.412
Something you can never get back is time.

01:20:27.185 --> 01:20:29.085
Now am I just another mouth to feed?

01:20:30.745 --> 01:20:33.495
Looks like you just became
50% of the rest of my men.

01:20:34.335 --> 01:20:36.493
God, you really love
your math jokes, don't you?

01:20:41.465 --> 01:20:43.365
Where the hell did you get that gun?

01:20:45.765 --> 01:20:46.675
I just Googled

01:20:48.182 --> 01:20:49.963
"where can I find a gun?"

01:20:49.965 --> 01:20:50.798
And bam.

01:20:53.565 --> 01:20:55.606
I saved your fuckin' life, old man.

01:21:03.345 --> 01:21:04.995
But it only came with one bullet.

01:21:10.815 --> 01:21:13.158
That's okay. It's a nine millimeter.

01:21:14.135 --> 01:21:16.502
Maybe Sam had some hidden on his boat.

01:22:03.525 --> 01:22:05.848
If he had bullets we
would've found them by now.

01:22:08.854 --> 01:22:11.004
You ready for a
one-way trip to the Cove?

01:22:12.276 --> 01:22:14.033
Do I look ready?

01:22:14.035 --> 01:22:15.093
Hell yeah.

01:22:15.095 --> 01:22:16.363
At this point, I think it's the only way

01:22:16.365 --> 01:22:18.515
I'm gonna get you out
of my hair, let's go.

01:22:54.785 --> 01:22:57.378
Let's leave after sunset
when the winds die down.

01:22:59.465 --> 01:23:01.133
Roger that, Cap'n.

01:23:01.135 --> 01:23:04.023
It's flatter and we'll get more mileage.

01:23:04.025 --> 01:23:05.193
There's no way we're gonna make it

01:23:05.195 --> 01:23:06.745
with the amount of gas we have.

01:23:08.995 --> 01:23:11.563
Do you think we could
paddle the rest of the way?

01:23:11.565 --> 01:23:13.523
We won't really have any other choice.

01:23:13.525 --> 01:23:16.225
Unless they spot us and send
a boat to come tow us in.

01:23:18.665 --> 01:23:19.773
By my estimation,

01:23:19.775 --> 01:23:22.253
we'll probably make it till
about the 11-hour mark,

01:23:22.255 --> 01:23:24.738
then we'll be out of gas and
we'll have to start paddling.

01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:28.108
But if everything's in our favor,

01:23:29.625 --> 01:23:30.925
we might actually make it.

01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:35.203
Also, keep in mind, Cairo,

01:23:35.205 --> 01:23:37.953
I have no idea what's outside the harbor.

01:23:37.955 --> 01:23:39.383
Once we get to a certain distance,

01:23:39.385 --> 01:23:41.183
there could be bad weather,

01:23:41.185 --> 01:23:42.585
there could be more pirates,

01:23:43.835 --> 01:23:46.758
but at least there won't be any sea lions.

01:23:46.760 --> 01:23:48.483
But I'm gonna teach you
how to use the coordinates

01:23:48.485 --> 01:23:50.753
on this compass, in case
something happens to me.

01:23:50.755 --> 01:23:52.205
That way, you can keep going.

01:23:54.295 --> 01:23:55.563
- You see this?
- Mm-hm.

01:23:55.565 --> 01:23:56.863
This is the direction we're facing.

01:23:56.865 --> 01:24:01.048
We're gonna go at 180 degrees
for at least half our trip.

01:24:02.835 --> 01:24:05.221
I'm guessing tomorrow
when the sun comes up,

01:24:05.223 --> 01:24:08.390
then I'll probably switch over to 200.

01:29:15.125 --> 01:29:16.548
This is a sign, Cairo.

01:29:17.705 --> 01:29:19.003
This is God's way of saying

01:29:19.005 --> 01:29:20.443
that my daughter doesn't wanna see me.

01:29:20.445 --> 01:29:22.145
That's bullshit and you know it.

01:29:24.385 --> 01:29:25.218
Okay?

01:29:26.675 --> 01:29:28.213
We'll...

01:29:28.215 --> 01:29:30.873
We'll find another boat. We'll fix it up.

01:29:30.875 --> 01:29:33.373
We'll get more parts. I'll find more gas.

01:29:33.375 --> 01:29:35.548
It is exhausting how naive you are.

01:29:36.685 --> 01:29:38.818
Sam was the mechanic, I just got lucky.

01:29:42.245 --> 01:29:44.128
Sol, we can do it.

01:29:47.165 --> 01:29:48.333
Come on.

01:29:48.335 --> 01:29:49.168
Just leave.

01:29:50.155 --> 01:29:51.068
Just leave.

01:29:52.725 --> 01:29:55.533
Go find another boat and start rowing.

01:29:55.535 --> 01:29:57.073
I showed you how to use that compass.

01:29:57.075 --> 01:29:59.225
You can get there in
probably a day or two.

01:30:00.665 --> 01:30:02.565
I'll hold off Luther as long as I can.

01:30:05.070 --> 01:30:06.170
But I gotta stay here.

01:30:09.081 --> 01:30:09.914
Just go.

01:30:11.081 --> 01:30:11.914
Go!

01:31:43.185 --> 01:31:45.850
I told you to go!

01:31:45.852 --> 01:31:47.553
You don't need me.

01:31:47.555 --> 01:31:50.563
Oh...

01:31:50.565 --> 01:31:51.848
But I do need you.

01:31:56.802 --> 01:31:58.958
You know, Solomon, when I was a kid,

01:32:00.225 --> 01:32:02.993
the doctors, they told me

01:32:02.995 --> 01:32:04.865
that I exhibit

01:32:05.735 --> 01:32:10.121
moderate sociopathic tendencies.

01:32:10.123 --> 01:32:12.863
Not so moderate anymore, huh?

01:32:14.135 --> 01:32:17.573
But they said that my problem was that

01:32:17.575 --> 01:32:20.448
I don't care about people.

01:32:23.515 --> 01:32:25.403
But that's not true, you see,

01:32:25.405 --> 01:32:29.012
there was one person that I cared about,

01:32:30.442 --> 01:32:31.275
and you,

01:32:32.572 --> 01:32:34.772
you took him away from me!

01:32:36.025 --> 01:32:38.212
I was just doing my job, Luther!

01:32:38.214 --> 01:32:39.391
Your father was not a good man!

01:33:23.707 --> 01:33:25.957
Captain Benjamin Solomon?

01:33:28.728 --> 01:33:31.061
We're your ride to the Cove.

01:33:44.255 --> 01:33:45.686
Dad.

01:33:45.688 --> 01:33:46.521
Dad!

01:35:40.690 --> 01:35:45.690
