20:14.254 --> 20:16.256
‐ HOW'S THAT?

20:16.340 --> 20:18.050
‐ THEY'RE DEAD INSIDE,
<i>MAMI.</i>

20:18.091 --> 20:21.678
LIKE WHEN YOU STEP
ON A GRAVE‐‐WHOA.

20:21.762 --> 20:23.388
YOU'D UNDERSTAND
IF YOU SAW HIM.

20:23.430 --> 20:25.390
‐ HE NEVER SAW
ODIN ROSSI.

20:25.432 --> 20:27.851
HE'S LYING OUT OF HIS ASS
LIKE ALWAYS.

20:27.935 --> 20:29.019
‐ BUT YOU'VE SEEN HIM.

20:29.102 --> 20:31.813
‐ I FOLLOWED HIM ONCE,
AFTER A DROP.

20:31.897 --> 20:32.856
GET THIS‐‐

20:32.940 --> 20:34.274
HE'S THIS WHITE DUDE,

20:34.316 --> 20:35.526
WEARS A THREE PIECE SUIT,

20:35.609 --> 20:37.444
WORKS IN A HIGH RISE
DOWNTOWN.

20:37.528 --> 20:39.738
‐ YO, I HEARD
HE KILLED HIS OWN FAMILY

20:39.780 --> 20:42.866
JUST SO HE WOULDN'T
HAVE ANY WEAKNESSES,

20:42.950 --> 20:44.826
AND HE LIKED IT.

20:44.910 --> 20:48.330
‐ HE SMUGGLES THE DRUGS HIMSELF
IN THIS DIPLOMATIC POUCH.

20:48.413 --> 20:49.873
THAT WAY,
NO ONE CAN SEARCH IT.

20:49.957 --> 20:51.500
‐ HERE'S THE THING.

20:51.583 --> 20:53.418
ANYONE WHO SAYS
THEY'VE SEEN THE GUY

20:53.460 --> 20:54.378
IS LYING.

20:54.419 --> 20:55.754
‐ WHY?

20:55.837 --> 21:00.676
‐ BECAUSE I HEAR HE KILLS ANYONE
WHO SEES HIS FACE.

21:00.759 --> 21:03.720
‐ PLEASE.

21:03.762 --> 21:04.930
‐ BRIGGS, ALL RIGHT.
I GET IT, ALL RIGHT?

21:05.013 --> 21:06.640
BUT WE HAVE
TO ARREST BELLO NOW.

21:06.723 --> 21:08.850
‐ NO CAN DO, MIKE.

21:08.934 --> 21:10.102
‐ I SAW HIM HANDLING THE DRUGS
WITH MY OWN EYES, ALL RIGHT?

21:10.185 --> 21:11.645
WE HAVE ENOUGH EVIDENCE.

21:11.728 --> 21:13.730
‐ NOW, SEE, THAT RIGHT THERE
IS THE EXUBERANCE OF YOUTH.

21:13.772 --> 21:15.148
IT'LL GET YOU
IN TROUBLE.

21:15.232 --> 21:16.483
LISTEN, MIKE, WE'RE NOT GOING
TO ARREST BELLO NOW,

21:16.567 --> 21:18.068
BECAUSE WHEN WE
TAKE HIM DOWN,

21:18.110 --> 21:19.444
WE WANT TO PULL DOWN EVERYONE
THAT HE IS IN BUSINESS WITH.

21:19.528 --> 21:20.696
AND I MEAN EVERYONE.

21:20.779 --> 21:24.491
WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH
FOR THAT YET.

21:24.575 --> 21:28.620
‐ BRIGGS, PEOPLE ARE GOING
TO DIE BECAUSE OF ME.

21:28.704 --> 21:31.540
‐ MORNING, CHARLES.
‐ THIS IS USELESS.

21:31.623 --> 21:33.584
ODIN ROSSI IS APPARENTLY
A WHITE ARGENTINEAN,

21:33.667 --> 21:36.003
WHO KILLS WITH A LOOK
AND PISSES FIRE.

21:36.086 --> 21:37.379
‐ WELL, HOT DAMN.

21:37.421 --> 21:38.505
SOUNDS LIKE WE NEED THAT GUY
ON OUR TEAM, HUH?

21:38.589 --> 21:40.048
‐ THE GUY'S A GHOST.

21:40.090 --> 21:42.384
I MEAN, I CAN'T EVEN FIND
ANY SOLID INTEL ON HIM.

21:42.426 --> 21:43.802
‐ AND I HAVE A DEALER
THAT'S CUTTING HIS SUPPLY

21:43.885 --> 21:45.429
WITH STUFF THAT'S GOING
TO KILL PEOPLE.

21:45.512 --> 21:48.181
‐ YEAH, AND I THINK I GOT
A WAY FOR EVERYONE TO WIN HERE.

21:48.265 --> 21:50.517
NOW, CHARLIE, YOU GOT
A SUPPLIER WITHOUT A FACE.

21:50.601 --> 21:52.102
MIKEY, YOU GOT A GUY
WHO NEEDS HEROIN.

21:52.144 --> 21:55.939
‐ DID YOU MISS THE PART WHERE
I CAN'T ACTUALLY FIND ODIN?

21:56.023 --> 21:56.982
‐ I MEAN,
COME ON, CHARLIE,

21:57.065 --> 21:57.941
HE'S NOT GOING
TO SHOW HIS FACE

21:58.025 --> 21:59.109
FOR SOME JUNKIE
ON THE STREET.

21:59.192 --> 22:01.820
‐ YOU WANT BELLO
TO REACH OUT.

22:01.903 --> 22:03.322
‐ NOW THAT'S
THE KIND OF GUY

22:03.405 --> 22:04.781
THAT ODIN WOULD
SHOW HIS FACE FOR.

22:04.865 --> 22:07.159
‐ BUT HE GETS HIS STUFF
FROM THE CAZA CARTEL, ALL RIGHT?

22:07.242 --> 22:08.368
HE IS NOT GOING
TO WANT THEM KNOWING

22:08.452 --> 22:09.786
HE'S LOOKING
FOR A NEW SUPPLIER.

22:09.870 --> 22:11.371
‐ THAT'S WHY HE'S GOING
TO USE A MIDDLE MAN

22:11.455 --> 22:13.248
WHEN HE APPROACHES ODIN.

22:13.290 --> 22:14.875
ME.

22:14.916 --> 22:16.585
HMM?

22:19.171 --> 22:20.422
‐ NICE.

22:33.268 --> 22:36.271
‐ I THOUGHT ABOUT
WHAT YOU SAID THE OTHER DAY.

22:36.313 --> 22:38.315
YOU WERE RIGHT.

22:38.398 --> 22:41.318
IT SHOWED WEAKNESS
TO CUT THE DRUGS.

22:41.401 --> 22:42.402
‐ I HOPE
I DIDN'T OVERSTEP.

22:42.444 --> 22:44.363
‐ NO, NO.
YOU HAD A POINT.

22:44.446 --> 22:48.950
SO INSTEAD OF WEAKNESS,
WE WILL SHOW STRENGTH.

22:48.992 --> 22:50.535
WE WILL TAKE THE CORNERS
BY GUNPOINT,

22:50.619 --> 22:53.789
SEIZE THEIR DRUGS
AND MAKE THEM OUR OWN.

22:53.830 --> 22:57.709
‐ THAT WILL DEFINITELY
SEND A MESSAGE.

22:57.751 --> 23:01.171
WHY DON'T YOU
GO FURTHER?

23:01.254 --> 23:03.924
‐ WHAT ARE YOUR IDEAS?

23:04.007 --> 23:05.592
‐ CHOOSE A NEW SUPPLIER.

23:05.634 --> 23:07.427
‐ BETRAY CAZA?

23:07.469 --> 23:11.264
‐ POWERFUL MEN ARE DEFINED
BY THE RISKS THEY TAKE.

23:11.306 --> 23:16.186
OR YOU COULD JUST GO
BEAT UP SOME CORNER THUGS.

23:16.269 --> 23:18.563
‐ WHAT ARE YOUR SUGGESTIONS?

23:18.605 --> 23:19.940
‐ ODIN ROSSI.

23:20.023 --> 23:22.150
‐ I HEARD OF HIM.

23:22.234 --> 23:24.111
BUT I DON'T HAVE A CONNECT
TO HIM.

23:24.194 --> 23:28.824
‐ PAUL DOES.

23:28.907 --> 23:31.743
‐ TELL PAUL
THAT HE HAS 24 HOURS

23:31.785 --> 23:33.787
TO SET UP
A MEETING.

23:33.870 --> 23:35.956
OTHERWISE,
WE HIT THE STREETS.

23:35.997 --> 23:38.125
‐ OKAY.

23:43.755 --> 23:45.257
‐ HEY, DANNY.

23:49.845 --> 23:51.680
WORD IS,
YOU KNOW ODIN, HUH?

23:51.763 --> 23:52.889
‐ I MIGHT.

23:52.931 --> 23:54.224
WHAT'S IT WORTH
TO YOU?

23:54.266 --> 23:55.308
‐ I JUST WANT
TO GET A MESSAGE TO HIM.

23:55.392 --> 23:57.561
THAT'S ALL.

23:57.602 --> 24:00.272
‐ AND WHAT DOES THE MESSENGER
GET OUT OF ALL THIS?

24:00.313 --> 24:02.941
‐ WHAT DOES HE WANT?

24:02.983 --> 24:04.568
‐ A CUT‐‐

24:04.609 --> 24:06.069
‐ OF WHATEVER BUSINESS
YOU'RE SETTING UP.

24:06.111 --> 24:07.446
‐ MM. YOU KNOW,

24:07.487 --> 24:10.282
I THINK WE BOTH KNOW
YOU AIN'T GETTING THAT.

24:10.323 --> 24:12.117
‐ THEN I AIN'T GOT NO IDEA
HOW TO FIND HIM, <i>PAPI.</i>

24:12.200 --> 24:13.869
‐ HUH.

24:13.952 --> 24:15.662
ALL RIGHT, THIS IS
WHAT I CAN OFFER YOU‐‐

24:15.746 --> 24:17.914
THAT YOU WON'T GET CUT
FROM NUT SACK TO PIE HOLE.

24:17.956 --> 24:19.624
‐ YO, YOU THINK
YOU THREATENING ME

24:19.708 --> 24:21.001
IS GOING
TO MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE?

24:21.084 --> 24:22.961
‐ I'M NOT THREATENING YOU.

24:23.044 --> 24:24.921
BELLO IS.

24:24.963 --> 24:26.673
‐ THIS IS FOR BELLO?

24:26.757 --> 24:27.674
‐ IT IS.

24:27.758 --> 24:29.718
‐ I DON'T KNOW ODIN, MAN.

24:29.760 --> 24:31.261
I SWEAR.

24:31.344 --> 24:32.679
‐ ALL RIGHT.

24:32.763 --> 24:33.930
YOU SEEM
LIKE A FRIENDLY GUY.

24:34.014 --> 24:35.182
MAKE YOURSELF
A NEW FRIEND, HUH?

24:38.769 --> 24:40.562
‐ OKAY.

24:40.604 --> 24:43.190
SEE,
WHEN YOU SMOKE HEROIN,

24:43.273 --> 24:46.485
SOOT FORMS ON THE BOTTOM
OF THE TINFOIL.

24:46.568 --> 24:49.029
AND IF YOU HANDLE
THE FOIL ENOUGH,

24:49.112 --> 24:50.238
YOU CAN GET
BLACK FINGERS.

24:50.280 --> 24:51.573
‐ OH, YEAH.

24:51.615 --> 24:52.783
ALL RIGHT.

24:52.824 --> 24:53.784
SO IF MY HANDS ARE CLEAN
WHEN I'M UNDER,

24:53.825 --> 24:54.868
I'M DONE.

24:54.951 --> 24:56.119
‐ EXACTLY.
‐ I GOT IT.

24:56.161 --> 24:57.913
‐ YOU'RE LIKE
A LITTLE WALKING SPONGE,

24:57.954 --> 24:59.206
YOU KNOW THAT?
‐ [chuckles]

24:59.289 --> 25:00.916
‐ GIVE ME THAT, SON.

25:00.957 --> 25:02.334
‐ JOHNNY, WHAT DID
WE TELL YOU

25:02.417 --> 25:03.960
ABOUT SNATCHING
OTHER PEOPLE'S STUFF?

25:04.044 --> 25:06.880
‐ THAT SHARING IS CARING,
MAN.

25:06.922 --> 25:08.548
THAT'S A MEAN‐LOOKING DUDE.

25:08.590 --> 25:09.758
WHO IS HE?

25:09.800 --> 25:12.552
‐ YOUR BABY MAMA.
GIVE ME THAT, MAN.

25:12.594 --> 25:14.429
THE NEW C.I.
I'M WORKING ON.

25:14.471 --> 25:15.680
‐ YOU'RE RECRUITING
A NEW ONE?

25:15.764 --> 25:17.599
‐ WATCH OUT, NOW.
THE SPONGE IS HUNGRY.

25:17.641 --> 25:20.560
‐ NO, I'M JUST CHECKING IN
ON THOSE DRUG SMUGGLING ROBOTS.

25:20.602 --> 25:21.728
‐ YO,
IF IT'S THE DOCKS,

25:21.770 --> 25:22.771
WHY DON'T YOU
USE FRANK THE TANK?

25:22.854 --> 25:23.814
‐ CAN'T.
HE FELL OFF A CRATE.

25:23.897 --> 25:24.940
‐ REALLY?

25:24.981 --> 25:27.108
‐ AND LANDED ON A KNIFE
14 TIMES.

25:27.192 --> 25:28.235
[laughter]

25:28.276 --> 25:30.320
‐ THAT'S ONE HELL
OF A FALL.

25:30.403 --> 25:31.738
[door closes]

25:34.407 --> 25:35.992
‐ CHARLIE'S GETTING
SOME ALONE TIME.

25:36.076 --> 25:38.829
‐ HEY.
‐ HEY.

25:38.912 --> 25:40.372
‐ HOW'D IT GO?
‐ OH, IT WENT GREAT.

25:40.455 --> 25:41.623
ACTUALLY,
I JUST HEARD BACK.

25:41.665 --> 25:43.667
GOT A MEETING TOMORROW
AT EL SEGUNDO PIER.

25:43.750 --> 25:44.751
BELLO, ODIN, AND ME.

25:44.835 --> 25:45.919
‐ THAT'S GREAT.
‐ YEAH.

25:46.002 --> 25:47.838
WE CAN FINALLY
GET EYES ON THE BASTARD.

25:47.921 --> 25:50.841
[indistinct chatter]

25:50.924 --> 25:52.259
ABOUT THE OTHER DAY,
AT YOUR C. I.'S PLACE‐‐

25:52.300 --> 25:53.343
‐ DON'T MENTION IT.

25:53.426 --> 25:55.554
‐ I NEED TO.
YOU SAVED MY ASS.

25:55.595 --> 25:57.514
KIND OF FEEL LIKE
I OWE YOUR C.I. AN APOLOGY.

25:57.597 --> 25:59.516
I PUKED
ALL OVER THE PLACE.

25:59.599 --> 26:05.188
‐ YOU DID MAKE
A SPECTACULAR MESS.

26:05.272 --> 26:06.273
‐ WELL, MAYBE I SHOULD
GO BACK THERE

26:06.356 --> 26:07.190
AND HELP HIM
CLEAN UP.

26:07.274 --> 26:08.650
‐ I TOOK CARE OF IT.

26:08.733 --> 26:13.363
IT'S DONE.

26:13.446 --> 26:15.782
‐ WE DON'T
KEEP SECRETS, BRIGGS.

26:15.866 --> 26:17.158
‐ REALLY?

26:17.242 --> 26:19.119
"WE DON'T
KEEP SECRETS"?

26:19.160 --> 26:20.912
‐ THAT'S NOT FAIR.
‐ YES, IT IS.

26:20.954 --> 26:22.205
BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT?

26:22.289 --> 26:24.249
YOU'RE RIGHT NOT
TO TELL THEM YOUR SECRET.

26:24.291 --> 26:25.333
THEY DON'T
NEED TO KNOW.

26:29.671 --> 26:32.424
‐ YOU'RE WRONG.

26:32.465 --> 26:35.093
‐ [laughing] LEVI'S WEARING
HIS BIG BOY PANTS.

26:35.176 --> 26:36.636
‐ I AM.
‐ IT'S TERRIBLE.

26:36.720 --> 26:38.555
IT TASTES LIKE AN ARTICHOKE
AND A POTATO HAD A BABY.

26:38.597 --> 26:40.348
‐ TASTES LIKE RAINBOWS.
‐ AND THEN YOU BOILED IT‐‐

26:40.432 --> 26:42.309
‐ HEY, EVERYBODY.

26:42.392 --> 26:45.770
THERE'S SOMETHING I NEED
TO TELL YOU ALL.

26:45.854 --> 26:50.025
I SHOT HEROIN
A COUPLE OF DAYS AGO.

26:50.108 --> 26:53.278
‐ ARE YOU SERIOUS?

26:53.361 --> 26:55.238
ARE YOU OKAY?

26:55.280 --> 26:57.741
‐ YEAH, IT WAS IN THE MOMENT
ON THAT QUINN CASE.

26:57.782 --> 26:59.034
I SCREWED UP.

26:59.117 --> 27:01.578
‐ LOOK, CHARLIE,
IF IT WAS JUST THIS ONE TIME‐‐

27:01.620 --> 27:03.079
‐ IT WAS TWICE.

27:03.121 --> 27:04.539
I HAD A BAD REACTION,

27:04.623 --> 27:07.584
AND I NEEDED SOME
TO GET ME THROUGH MY EVAL.

27:07.626 --> 27:12.005
‐ WHY DO SOME OF Y'ALL
LOOK LESS THAN SURPRISED?

27:12.088 --> 27:13.506
‐ WASN'T MY PLACE
TO SAY, MAN.

27:13.590 --> 27:15.300
‐ DOESN'T MATTER.

27:15.383 --> 27:18.970
ALL THAT MATTERS IS THAT
I KEPT SOMETHING FROM THE HOUSE.

27:24.434 --> 27:27.937
‐ HEY.

27:28.021 --> 27:30.482
YOU OKAY?

27:30.565 --> 27:32.067
‐ YEAH.
BETTER NOW.

27:32.108 --> 27:33.652
‐ YEAH?

27:33.735 --> 27:34.653
CAN I ASK YOU SOMETHING?

27:34.736 --> 27:36.029
‐ SURE.

27:36.112 --> 27:39.199
‐ YOU GOT ANY MORE?

27:39.282 --> 27:40.617
‐ I DIDN'T THINK
CHASING THE DRAGON

27:40.659 --> 27:42.077
WAS YOUR STYLE,
LEVI.

27:42.118 --> 27:46.122
‐ I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE
YOU'RE NOT TEMPTED.

27:46.206 --> 27:51.503
WHERE'D YOU GET IT?

27:51.586 --> 27:52.837
‐ JUST SOME JUNKIE C.I.

27:52.921 --> 27:54.506
‐ RIGHT.

27:56.383 --> 27:58.760
‐ I DON'T HAVE ANY MORE.

27:58.843 --> 28:03.181
‐ OKAY.
OKAY, OKAY.

28:03.264 --> 28:04.432
COME HERE.

28:06.267 --> 28:07.268
‐ COME HERE.

28:07.310 --> 28:09.437
STUPID BASTARD.

28:09.479 --> 28:10.897
[both chuckling]

28:10.939 --> 28:13.233
YOU KNOW WE'RE ALWAYS
HERE FOR YOU.

28:26.871 --> 28:28.456
‐ YOU DON'T HAVE
TO CHECK CHARLIE'S FINGERS

28:28.540 --> 28:30.750
FOR TINFOIL SOOT.

28:30.750 --> 28:32.419
I ALREADY DID.

28:32.460 --> 28:33.753
‐ YOU DID, HUH?

28:33.837 --> 28:38.591
‐ I'M DEA.
IT'S PRACTICALLY SECOND NATURE.

28:38.675 --> 28:39.676
‐ AND?

28:39.759 --> 28:42.053
‐ THEY'RE CLEAN.

28:42.095 --> 28:43.930
BUT EVERY DAY FROM NOW ON,
I'LL BE CHECKING.

28:44.013 --> 28:49.769
WE HAVE
TO HAVE EACH OTHER'S BACKS.

28:52.188 --> 28:55.108
‐ SUPPOSE ONE OF US ACTUALLY
DID, YOU KNOW, BECOME ADDICTED.

28:55.150 --> 28:56.860
‐ THEY'D PULL US OUT.

28:56.943 --> 28:57.861
GO TO TREATMENT.

28:57.944 --> 28:59.028
‐ AND OUR CASES?

28:59.112 --> 29:00.321
I MEAN,
ALL OUR OLD CASES, THEY'D JUST‐‐

29:00.405 --> 29:02.157
‐ THEY'D BE REOPENED.

29:02.240 --> 29:03.658
‐ THAT'S HUGE.

29:03.742 --> 29:04.784
‐ LOOK, YOU NEED
TO BE ABLE TO TRUST

29:04.868 --> 29:06.911
WHO YOU'RE
IN THE FIELD WITH.

29:06.953 --> 29:11.291
AND AN ADDICT
CAN NEVER BE TRUSTED.

39:11.807 --> 39:12.850
THAT WAY I DON'T
HAVE TO LOOK BEHIND ME,

39:12.933 --> 39:13.934
AND I CAN SEE
THE ENTIRE AREA.

39:13.976 --> 39:15.061
‐ YEAH?

39:15.102 --> 39:16.604
BRING YOUR DAUGHTER
TO WORK DAY?

39:16.687 --> 39:19.690
‐ WHAT'S YOUR BET?

39:19.774 --> 39:21.400
‐ THE FAT GUY,
'CAUSE HE WANTS YOU

39:21.442 --> 39:22.610
TO THINK IT AIN'T HIM.

39:22.652 --> 39:23.611
‐ I'M TAKING THE GUY
WITH THE GOATEE.

39:23.694 --> 39:25.780
[phone chimes]
‐ YOU SEXIST.

39:25.821 --> 39:28.783
‐ CHARLIE WANTS 20 ON THE GUY
IN THE HAWAIIAN SHIRT.

39:28.866 --> 39:30.618
‐ AH, SHE'S GOT
A BETTER ANGLE THAN US.

39:30.660 --> 39:33.454
THAT'S NOT EVEN FAIR.

39:35.289 --> 39:38.459
‐ YOU CLAIM TO BE‐‐A MAN
WHO CAN GET‐‐ANYTHING.

39:38.542 --> 39:39.877
‐ WE GOT A PROBLEM.
‐ WELL, YOU KNOW ME, I AM‐‐

39:39.919 --> 39:41.045
‐ WHAT'S WRONG
WITH THE SIGNAL?

39:41.087 --> 39:43.089
‐ HIS WATCH IS CUTTING
IN AND OUT.

39:44.632 --> 39:46.717
‐ SO TELL ME, PAUL.

39:46.759 --> 39:49.261
WHY WERE YOU NOT ABLE
TO DELIVER ODIN?

39:51.389 --> 39:54.225
‐ WHO SAYS I WASN'T?

39:58.104 --> 39:59.980
‐ THIS IS FROM ODIN?
‐ IT IS.

40:00.064 --> 40:03.776
CONSIDER IT A SHOW
OF GOOD FAITH.

40:03.859 --> 40:06.737
‐ HE WANTS ME
TO GO AGAINST THE CAZA,

40:06.779 --> 40:09.281
A DANGEROUS MOVE,

40:09.323 --> 40:11.409
AND HE WANTS ME TO DO IT
THROUGH A MIDDLEMAN.

40:11.450 --> 40:12.952
HE‐‐
[scoffs]

40:13.035 --> 40:14.954
‐ YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND
HIS POSITION.

40:15.037 --> 40:17.957
‐ HE HAS TO UNDERSTAND MINE.

40:18.040 --> 40:20.835
HE SHOULD GIVE THIS
TO ME HIMSELF.

40:20.918 --> 40:23.546
‐ HE IS.

40:26.590 --> 40:29.093
‐ WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

40:29.176 --> 40:32.930
‐ I MEAN ODIN IS DELIVERING IT
TO YOU, IN PERSON.

40:37.309 --> 40:38.811
‐ YOU ARE ODIN ROSSI?

40:38.894 --> 40:42.732
‐ ALWAYS HAVE BEEN.

40:44.859 --> 40:46.819
‐ OKAY, BRIGGS IS ON THE MOVE.
DID HE SEE ODIN?

40:46.902 --> 40:48.946
‐ I GOT NOTHING.

40:49.029 --> 40:50.364
‐ OKAY, CHARLIE,
WE'RE GOING TO NEED YOU

40:50.448 --> 40:51.657
TO MAKE AN APPROACH,
SEE IF YOU CAN GET EARS ON HIM.

40:51.741 --> 40:52.783
‐ GOD,
I SHOULD BE OUT THERE.

40:52.867 --> 40:54.160
‐ NO, BELLO TOLD YOU
NOT TO COME.

40:54.243 --> 40:57.872
HE SEES YOU, IT'S BLOWN.
‐ CHARLIE'S GOT THIS.

40:59.123 --> 41:00.624
‐ WHY ALL THE GAMES?

41:00.666 --> 41:03.085
‐ WELL, YOU SAID IT YOURSELF.
CAZA'S DANGEROUS.

41:03.169 --> 41:04.920
HOW CAN THEY KILL A MAN
WHO DOESN'T EXIST?

41:05.004 --> 41:06.255
‐ [grunts]

41:06.297 --> 41:07.465
BUT A MAN
THAT DOESN'T EXIST

41:07.548 --> 41:08.841
STILL NEEDS DISTRIBUTION.

41:08.924 --> 41:11.427
‐ AH, YES, AND FROM
EVERYTHING MIKE TELLS ME,

41:11.469 --> 41:13.596
YOU'RE A MAN WHO'S WORD
CAN DEFINITELY BE TRUSTED.

41:13.637 --> 41:16.557
‐ DOES MIKE KNOW?
‐ NO, HE DOESN'T NEED TOO.

41:16.599 --> 41:19.101
THE ONLY ONES WHO KNOW
ARE YOU AND ME.

41:19.143 --> 41:23.898
IF THAT CHANGES, I WALK.

41:26.901 --> 41:28.444
‐ WHERE'D THEY GO?
HELP ME OUT.

41:28.486 --> 41:30.446
‐ ALL RIGHT, CHARLIE,
WE GOT 'EM, WE GOT 'EM.

41:30.488 --> 41:31.781
THEY'RE RIGHT AT YOUR 3:00,
ABOUT 100 YARDS.

41:31.864 --> 41:34.575
‐ NO.
‐ NO, YOUR 4:00 NOW.

41:38.621 --> 41:42.458
‐ IF I AGREE, HOW MUCH PRODUCT
CAN YOU GET ME?

41:42.500 --> 41:46.003
‐ I COULD MAINTAIN YOUR CURRENT
LEVELS AT 85% OF THE COST,

41:46.086 --> 41:48.589
ASSUMING WE KEEP
MY LITTLE SECRET ABOUT WHO I AM,

41:48.672 --> 41:50.633
OF COURSE.

41:50.716 --> 41:52.426
‐ WE HAVE A DEAL.

41:52.510 --> 41:53.844
‐ WELL, THEN, I GUESS
THE LESS WE'RE SEEN TOGETHER,

41:53.928 --> 41:54.929
THE BETTER, RIGHT?

41:54.970 --> 41:57.014
‐ AGREED.

42:00.684 --> 42:02.812
‐ WHERE'S BELLO?

42:02.895 --> 42:05.689
‐ GONE.
‐ HOW MUCH?

42:05.773 --> 42:08.776
‐ ODIN?
‐ NO SHOW.

42:08.859 --> 42:10.110
BELLO WOULDN'T WAIT AROUND
ANY LONGER.

42:10.194 --> 42:11.946
I TRIED TO STALL
AS LONG AS I COULD.

42:11.987 --> 42:14.323
YOU GUYS DIDN'T HEAR IT?

42:14.406 --> 42:16.659
‐ THE WATCH WENT DEAD.
‐ [scoffs]

42:16.742 --> 42:20.204
YOU GOT TO BE KIDDING ME.

42:20.287 --> 42:23.249
WELL, TRUST ME,
YOU DIDN'T MISS MUCH.

42:52.987 --> 42:55.281
[dog barking]
