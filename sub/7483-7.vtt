WEBVTT

00:04.672 --> 00:07.506
(motor buzzing)

00:14.015 --> 00:16.015
Daddy, look!

00:16.017 --> 00:18.050
The plane is flying so low.

00:18.052 --> 00:19.184
That's not a real plane.

00:28.129 --> 00:29.495
Where's my phone?

00:29.497 --> 00:30.529
Have you seen it?

00:30.531 --> 00:33.065
Nope. Haven't seen it.

00:33.067 --> 00:34.700
I need to go.

00:34.702 --> 00:36.368
Give me my phone.

00:36.370 --> 00:38.704
I'm not finished
with my movie yet.

00:40.041 --> 00:41.340
Look at this thing.

00:41.342 --> 00:42.708
It's heading
right for us.

00:42.710 --> 00:45.110
Is that one of those
flying camera things?

01:32.359 --> 01:34.226
Another weak-hand
shooting exercise?

01:34.228 --> 01:35.494
What is that--
twice this week?

01:35.496 --> 01:37.830
Three times.

01:37.832 --> 01:40.799
The instructor is supposed
to get a higher score than you.

01:40.801 --> 01:42.568
That's why they call him
the instructor.

01:42.570 --> 01:43.836
That's not the point.

01:43.838 --> 01:45.504
The point is
it's a learned skill.

01:45.506 --> 01:46.872
It's something
you can get better at.

01:46.874 --> 01:48.740
Uh-huh.
So, why not get better?

01:48.742 --> 01:50.375
And this has nothing
to do with you wanting

01:50.377 --> 01:52.311
to beat the instructor's score
next time he comes?

01:52.313 --> 01:53.512
Not at all.

01:53.514 --> 01:55.180
You realize, of course,

01:55.182 --> 01:57.416
he is a subject matter expert?

01:57.418 --> 01:58.784
All he does is shoot
with his left hand.

01:58.786 --> 02:01.286
And never at a target that's
actually gonna shoot back.

02:01.288 --> 02:02.754
And the more I think about it,

02:02.756 --> 02:05.257
who's to say he wasn't
born left-handed, huh?

02:05.259 --> 02:06.291
When's he coming back?

02:06.293 --> 02:07.659
Three months?

02:07.661 --> 02:10.696
Well, he'd better
bring his lunch.

02:16.837 --> 02:18.804
(Kensi whoops)

02:18.806 --> 02:20.272
(whistles)
Impressive.

02:20.274 --> 02:21.807
Thank you.

02:21.809 --> 02:23.342
Sam wants to make
a name for himself

02:23.344 --> 02:24.810
in the highly competitive world

02:24.812 --> 02:26.879
of weak-hand shooting.

02:26.881 --> 02:28.614
Oh, yeah? I don't really endorse
the term "weak-hand shooting."

02:28.616 --> 02:30.582
'Cause I like to think
of myself as a gunslinger born

02:30.584 --> 02:32.084
in the Wild West,
you know what I mean,

02:32.085 --> 02:33.585
with a, a six-shooter
in each hand.

02:33.587 --> 02:35.287
My trusty steed
between my legs,

02:35.289 --> 02:36.655
riding through the sunset.
What's up, Trigger?

02:36.657 --> 02:37.789
And yet you have
a nine-millimeter

02:37.791 --> 02:40.225
in one hand
and a dog with

02:40.227 --> 02:42.828
anxiety issues in the other.
What? "Anxiety issues"?

02:42.830 --> 02:44.830
He's a bomb dog.
He doesn't have anxiety issues.

02:44.832 --> 02:46.999
Okay, so what would you call it?
Stage fright?

02:47.000 --> 02:49.167
I'd call it a sense of decorum.
He likes to do

02:49.170 --> 02:50.502
his business in private.
He wants to deuce out

02:50.504 --> 02:51.870
without you looking
at him like...

02:51.872 --> 02:53.539
You finished hijacking
our conversation?

02:53.540 --> 02:55.207
I wasn't hijacking
any conversation.

02:55.209 --> 02:56.542
She started attacking
Monty out of nowhere...
You were.

02:56.544 --> 02:57.643
Good morning, friends.

02:57.645 --> 02:58.844
I just wanted
to wish you a happy...

02:58.846 --> 03:00.646
Perfect timing.
Oh, we caught a case?

03:00.648 --> 03:02.281
See you in Ops?
Sure.

03:02.283 --> 03:04.950
Ha! She drives me so crazy.

03:04.952 --> 03:06.552
You all right?
What? No.

03:06.554 --> 03:08.453
What's going on?

03:08.455 --> 03:10.589
Monty likes to do
business in private.

03:10.591 --> 03:13.258
And she keeps wanting to label
him with anxiety issues.

03:13.260 --> 03:14.760
And I think that labels
are, you know, dangerous.

03:14.762 --> 03:16.362
Oh, totally.

03:16.363 --> 03:17.963
Uh, back in junior high,
there was this huge audition

03:17.965 --> 03:19.565
for the school musical.

03:19.567 --> 03:21.200
And it was-- I was clearly
the frontrunner, right?

03:21.202 --> 03:22.935
But the other guy was totally
gunning for it, and he,

03:22.937 --> 03:24.937
you know, he was...
I'm so sorry.

03:24.939 --> 03:26.271
I can't, I can't do it.
What?

03:26.273 --> 03:27.439
I got to go to Ops.

03:32.246 --> 03:34.580
So, before the audition
I killed my rival

03:34.582 --> 03:35.948
and buried him under the stage.

03:35.950 --> 03:37.916
Hey, you coming?

03:37.918 --> 03:39.751
Yeah.

03:39.753 --> 03:41.753
I need to go.
This is Antonis Cosse.

03:41.755 --> 03:43.822
NELL: He was killed today
at a hotel in Long Beach.

03:43.824 --> 03:44.923
ERIC:
Long Beach PD

03:44.925 --> 03:46.491
collected video footage

03:46.493 --> 03:47.726
from the victim's cell phone.

03:47.728 --> 03:49.261
The victim's phone?

03:49.263 --> 03:51.396
Yeah, the footage
was shot by a witness.

03:51.398 --> 03:52.698
Play it, Beale.

03:54.301 --> 03:56.268
SAM:
Remote controlled drone.
DEEKS: Wow.

03:56.270 --> 03:58.937
The killer gets points
for originality.

03:58.939 --> 04:00.339
Play it back
in slow-motion, Eric.

04:04.912 --> 04:06.979
(Sam chuckles)

04:06.981 --> 04:08.380
Drone must've had
a camera on it.

04:08.382 --> 04:09.615
The pilot blew the charge

04:09.617 --> 04:11.650
before Cosse could
knock it down.

04:11.652 --> 04:12.684
Whoever did it wanted
to make sure

04:12.686 --> 04:13.752
they hit the correct target.

04:13.754 --> 04:14.786
So, who is this guy?

04:14.788 --> 04:15.921
Why did we pull this case?

04:15.923 --> 04:16.922
Because Antonis Cosse

04:16.924 --> 04:18.290
wasn't his real name.

04:18.292 --> 04:19.491
NELL:
ATF was on-site

04:19.493 --> 04:20.959
because of the explosives.

04:20.961 --> 04:23.028
But when they ID'd the victim,
they realized

04:23.030 --> 04:25.330
his real name
was Elias Minas.

04:25.332 --> 04:27.432
Now, Minas, as it turns
out, was a member

04:27.434 --> 04:28.967
of the Greek terrorist
organization

04:28.969 --> 04:30.869
<i> Polites tin</i>
<i> Katapolemisi tis,</i>

04:30.871 --> 04:32.271
or PK.

04:32.273 --> 04:33.538
<i> Polites Katama</i> who?

04:33.540 --> 04:34.573
It's Greek

04:34.575 --> 04:35.807
for Citizens Combat.

04:35.809 --> 04:37.376
CALLEN:
PK's the group

04:37.377 --> 04:38.944
that had the RPG attack
on the U.S. Embassy in Athens.

04:38.946 --> 04:40.946
Yeah, and they have a lot
of different ideologies.

04:40.948 --> 04:43.282
But at the core,
they're an anarchist group.

04:43.284 --> 04:45.985
And their members are-are Greek.

04:45.986 --> 04:48.687
Just thought I should add
to the conversation.

04:48.689 --> 04:49.788
NELL:
Minas was a person of interest

04:49.790 --> 04:50.922
for Homeland, which is why

04:50.924 --> 04:52.391
they placed him
on the no-fly list.

04:52.393 --> 04:53.992
And yet, he made it
from Greece to L.A.?

04:53.994 --> 04:55.861
That's impressive.

04:55.863 --> 04:57.529
Could've come by ship to Mexico
and then muled up.

04:57.531 --> 04:58.930
ERIC:
I checked his cell phone.

04:58.932 --> 05:00.432
No GPS data on it.

05:00.434 --> 05:02.301
GRANGER:
Now, this guy was a high-ranking

05:02.303 --> 05:04.002
PK member-- I want
to know what he was

05:04.004 --> 05:06.538
doing in L.A.
and why he was killed.

05:06.540 --> 05:07.973
NELL:
Homeland is sending
an agent familiar

05:07.975 --> 05:09.775
with Minas to the boatshed.
Hetty would like to meet

05:09.777 --> 05:10.776
the two of you there.

05:10.778 --> 05:13.112
Done.
Got it.

05:13.113 --> 05:15.447
GRANGER:
Sierra Fisher took
the cell phone footage.

05:15.449 --> 05:18.317
Long Beach PD is holding her
and what's left of the drone.

05:18.319 --> 05:20.319
Go do what you do.

05:20.321 --> 05:22.321
ERIC:
Um, Nell?

05:22.323 --> 05:24.056
Um, what?
You know.

05:24.058 --> 05:25.357
Come on.

05:25.359 --> 05:26.692
NELL:
I know. I'm gonna.

05:26.694 --> 05:28.360
#Like, when?

05:28.362 --> 05:29.761
#Like, now.

05:29.763 --> 05:31.330
If you two don't

05:31.332 --> 05:33.765
cut out the Ewok routine,
I'm gonna send you home.

05:33.767 --> 05:37.069
Nell is an expert in the field
of radio controlled aircraft.

05:37.071 --> 05:39.538
Expert, huh?

05:39.540 --> 05:42.007
Well, more of a hobbyist really.

05:42.009 --> 05:43.508
ERIC:
Modest much?

05:43.510 --> 05:45.043
She's won
two Ventura County titles

05:45.045 --> 05:47.579
in aerobatics and is
one of the finalists...

05:47.581 --> 05:48.647
We get it, we get it.

05:48.649 --> 05:49.815
Nell, grab your
stuff, let's go.

05:49.817 --> 05:51.750
Okay.

05:51.752 --> 05:54.519
Go get 'em, tiger.
(clicks tongue)

06:02.062 --> 06:03.762
HETTY:
Let me get something straight,

06:03.764 --> 06:06.064
Agent Rollins.

06:06.066 --> 06:08.800
Homeland was working

06:08.802 --> 06:10.068
with Greek authorities

06:10.070 --> 06:11.803
to target Mr. Minas.

06:11.805 --> 06:13.105
But yet

06:13.107 --> 06:16.408
he was still able
to gain entrance to the U.S.?

06:16.410 --> 06:20.078
The Greeks alerted us that
he was using a false passport

06:20.080 --> 06:22.114
to board a plane to the U.S.

06:22.116 --> 06:24.049
So, you just let him come?

06:24.051 --> 06:26.151
We placed undercover
air marshals on the flight

06:26.153 --> 06:28.453
and took him into custody
when he landed at JFK.

06:28.455 --> 06:31.423
Minas had planned several

06:31.425 --> 06:32.758
of PK's attacks.

06:32.760 --> 06:34.126
He was a big get.

06:34.128 --> 06:36.395
DEEKS:
So, let me guess.

06:36.396 --> 06:38.663
He gave up something
on his Greek friends

06:38.664 --> 06:40.931
so that his stay in America
could be a little less prisony?

06:40.934 --> 06:42.467
He told us everything
he knew about PK.

06:42.469 --> 06:43.702
Their leadership structure,

06:43.704 --> 06:45.003
past attacks they
were involved with

06:45.005 --> 06:47.038
and what they had planned.

06:47.040 --> 06:48.807
The Greeks arrested two

06:48.809 --> 06:51.843
of PK's highest ranking members
based on his intel.

06:51.845 --> 06:54.413
And for this,

06:54.415 --> 06:57.549
you granted him
witness protection.

06:57.551 --> 07:00.452
Yes.

07:00.454 --> 07:02.888
You got to be kidding me.
KENSI:
Wait a minute.

07:02.890 --> 07:04.456
You took a known terrorist
on a no-fly list

07:04.458 --> 07:05.590
and put him
in witness protection?

07:05.592 --> 07:06.825
Was he, at least,
under surveillance?

07:06.826 --> 07:08.059
I mean, did you have
a team outside

07:08.061 --> 07:09.161
the hotel when he was killed?

07:10.130 --> 07:12.531
What is it, Agent Rollins?

07:16.770 --> 07:18.703
Until we were informed
this morning

07:18.705 --> 07:20.172
that Minas had been killed,

07:20.174 --> 07:22.441
we had no idea where he was.

07:22.443 --> 07:25.010
He was placed in
witness protection

07:25.012 --> 07:26.611
and given the new
name Antonis Cosse.

07:26.613 --> 07:28.213
And then

07:28.215 --> 07:30.615
three months ago, we lost him.

07:30.617 --> 07:33.485
Leapfrogged through a couple
of international flights and...

07:33.487 --> 07:34.886
he vanished.

07:34.888 --> 07:36.154
DEEKS:
Nobody put his new name

07:36.156 --> 07:39.224
on the watch list
and the no-fly list.

07:39.226 --> 07:42.561
The situation was remedied
as soon as we found out.

07:44.598 --> 07:48.500
Do you have any idea
why he was in L.A.?

07:49.470 --> 07:51.069
Or who killed him?

07:51.071 --> 07:52.804
I don't know why he was here,

07:52.806 --> 07:55.640
but he betrayed
every member of PK.

07:55.642 --> 07:57.676
If they knew
he was here in L.A.,

07:57.678 --> 07:59.778
they wouldn't hesitate
one second

07:59.780 --> 08:02.180
to go after him.

08:03.750 --> 08:05.851
Long Beach PD has the witness.

08:05.853 --> 08:07.953
They're gonna bring
her over here.

08:07.954 --> 08:10.054
Straight TNT would've
blown up the whole drone.

08:10.057 --> 08:12.924
This blast looks
more directional.

08:12.926 --> 08:14.876
Stable.

08:14.877 --> 08:16.827
Bet it's gonna come back
from the lab as Octol.

08:16.830 --> 08:18.697
That makes sense, the charge
would have been small.

08:18.699 --> 08:20.966
Be an easy payload
for a drone this size.

08:20.968 --> 08:23.001
Yeah. What's the drone

08:23.003 --> 08:24.035
telling you, Nell?

08:24.037 --> 08:25.270
You don't walk into a hobby shop

08:25.272 --> 08:26.938
and buy this sort of thing.

08:26.940 --> 08:27.973
Three high-torque servos.

08:27.975 --> 08:29.274
This thing is totally custom.

08:29.276 --> 08:31.610
It would've looked
beautiful in the air.

08:31.612 --> 08:33.144
Hobbyist, huh?

08:33.146 --> 08:35.780
Any idea where it took off from?

08:35.782 --> 08:37.048
Not yet.

08:37.050 --> 08:39.150
See, there's
this HD camera attachment here

08:39.152 --> 08:41.286
for the feed back to the pilot.

08:41.288 --> 08:42.654
But I doubt there's any

08:42.656 --> 08:44.823
onboard recording.
I may, however.

08:44.825 --> 08:46.024
be able to track
the takeoff point

08:46.026 --> 08:47.959
using the drone's
3G control system.

08:47.961 --> 08:49.160
Great.
Take it back to Ops.

08:49.162 --> 08:50.662
Good job.

08:52.099 --> 08:53.665
Ms. Fisher?
Yes.

08:55.903 --> 08:57.702
We're NCIS.
Agent Callen, Agent Hanna.

08:57.704 --> 09:00.305
You have someone coming
to pick you up?

09:00.307 --> 09:01.973
No.

09:01.975 --> 09:04.943
Nobody knows I'm here.

09:04.945 --> 09:06.545
I'm married.

09:06.547 --> 09:08.713
And not to the guy that blew up.

09:09.750 --> 09:10.949
Did you know

09:10.951 --> 09:12.884
Antonis well?
Tony?

09:12.886 --> 09:14.920
I mean a little.

09:14.922 --> 09:16.555
I met him at the gym.

09:16.557 --> 09:18.290
He didn't talk much,
didn't ask questions.

09:18.292 --> 09:20.325
Just the strong,
silent type.

09:20.327 --> 09:22.227
You know anyone like that?

09:23.897 --> 09:25.931
What'd you see this morning?

09:28.068 --> 09:31.136
Uh, sir, I didn't see anything.

09:31.138 --> 09:32.837
Just the explosion.

09:33.807 --> 09:35.574
Do you guys think I could

09:35.576 --> 09:37.075
get Tony's phone back?

09:37.077 --> 09:38.977
There might be some photos
on there I'd like to delete.

09:42.149 --> 09:45.150
It was just a question.

09:45.152 --> 09:48.153
You know, we've got a lot
of reporters out front.

09:48.155 --> 09:49.187
I mean, I'm sure
they'd love to have

09:49.189 --> 09:50.255
a chance to interview
an eyewitness.

09:50.257 --> 09:52.257
Yeah, I think that's
good thinking.

09:52.259 --> 09:53.291
Get her on the local news.

09:53.293 --> 09:54.993
Shake the tree a little bit.

09:54.995 --> 09:56.761
Maybe some other
witnesses come forward.
Let's do it.

09:56.763 --> 09:59.097
Come on, guys. A little help?

09:59.099 --> 10:00.932
You first.

10:00.934 --> 10:03.635
Okay, look.

10:03.637 --> 10:05.670
Tony went downstairs
to grab a coffee.

10:05.672 --> 10:07.606
When he came back,
he was freaking out.

10:07.608 --> 10:09.040
Said he needed to grab
his stuff and go.

10:09.042 --> 10:11.977
And that's when
that crazy robo

10:11.979 --> 10:13.979
killer flying bomb thing
came at him.

10:13.981 --> 10:16.181
The whole thing was...

10:17.818 --> 10:20.218
It was awful.

10:20.220 --> 10:22.053
That's everything I saw.

10:22.055 --> 10:24.656
It's all I know. I promise.

10:24.658 --> 10:27.058
We're gonna hold you.

10:27.060 --> 10:28.326
If your story checks out,

10:28.328 --> 10:30.028
you'll be released.

10:30.030 --> 10:31.997
Thank you.

10:31.999 --> 10:34.833
I just don't want anyone to find
out I was here with Tony.

10:34.835 --> 10:37.002
My husband's, like,
totally paranoid

10:37.004 --> 10:38.069
that I'm cheating on him.

10:38.071 --> 10:40.138
Hmm.

10:40.140 --> 10:42.140
Wonder why?

10:44.144 --> 10:46.044
She was telling
the truth.

10:46.046 --> 10:48.213
Minas was down in the
lobby getting coffee

10:48.215 --> 10:50.248
right before
the explosion.

10:50.250 --> 10:52.150
Then he spotted someone
in a silver Nissan

10:52.152 --> 10:53.852
across the driveway
and bolted.

10:53.854 --> 10:55.687
Can you ID that driver?

10:55.689 --> 10:56.688
I was able
to find him

10:56.690 --> 10:57.856
from a second
security cam

10:57.857 --> 10:59.023
and I ran him
through facial rec.

10:59.026 --> 11:00.025
His name is Frank Kouris.

11:00.027 --> 11:01.993
He's a Greek
national

11:01.995 --> 11:03.228
that arrived here
five months ago

11:03.230 --> 11:04.162
on a legit
passport.

11:04.164 --> 11:05.730
He's also one of the people

11:05.732 --> 11:08.767
that Minas turned on,
ID'd as a PK member.

11:08.769 --> 11:10.935
Why wasn't he picked up
after Minas outed him?

11:10.937 --> 11:12.203
FBI was searching
for him,

11:12.205 --> 11:14.105
but he was in the wind.

11:14.107 --> 11:15.940
All right.
Thanks, Eric.

11:15.942 --> 11:18.943
Kouris was in L.A.
before Minas was.

11:18.945 --> 11:21.746
If Kouris wasn't sent
here to kill Minas...

11:21.748 --> 11:23.281
what did PK send him here to do?

11:41.702 --> 11:44.069
I mean... you believe
they put a known terrorist

11:44.071 --> 11:46.204
in witness protection
and just lost him?

11:46.206 --> 11:47.338
Yeah, I do.

11:47.340 --> 11:48.973
I've seen a lot of
crazy stuff happen

11:48.975 --> 11:51.176
when, uh...
paperwork's involved.

11:51.178 --> 11:52.343
What?

11:52.345 --> 11:53.411
Nothing.

11:53.413 --> 11:55.847
It's good for strength,

11:55.849 --> 11:57.916
dexterity
and endurance...

11:57.918 --> 11:59.451
Perfect for weak-hand
shooting drills.

11:59.453 --> 12:00.786
What's your problem

12:00.787 --> 12:02.120
with me wanting
to get better at a skill

12:02.122 --> 12:03.822
that could potentially
save your life?

12:03.824 --> 12:05.790
I don't have a problem with you
getting better at anything.

12:05.792 --> 12:07.792
I merely question your need
to become proficient

12:07.794 --> 12:09.127
at every new thing
you hear about.

12:09.129 --> 12:10.895
You're the same way.
No, I'm not.

12:10.897 --> 12:12.464
I am an expert at
certain skills--

12:12.466 --> 12:15.467
skills that pertain
directly to this job.

12:18.739 --> 12:20.205
So weak-hand shooting
doesn't pertain to this job?

12:20.207 --> 12:21.673
No, it does. 100%.

12:21.674 --> 12:23.140
I get it, but this is
just the latest stop

12:23.143 --> 12:25.477
on the Sam Hanna World
Tour of Skill Acquisition.

12:25.479 --> 12:27.378
Everything I learn
is valuable to me,

12:27.380 --> 12:29.180
to the job and
to my partner.

12:29.182 --> 12:30.181
That strange
breathing thing?

12:30.183 --> 12:32.083
Ginástica Natural?

12:32.085 --> 12:34.052
And me controlling
my breathing

12:34.054 --> 12:35.820
and heart rate doesn't
benefit me in a gunfight?

12:35.822 --> 12:37.222
The magic class.

12:37.224 --> 12:38.490
It wasn't
a magic class.

12:38.492 --> 12:41.926
It was restraint removal
in stressful situations.

12:41.928 --> 12:43.461
You were handcuffed
in a box underwater.

12:43.463 --> 12:45.063
It was tactical training.

12:45.065 --> 12:46.297
Okay, Houdini,

12:46.299 --> 12:47.866
how are you gonna explain
the bird thing, huh?

12:47.868 --> 12:49.000
Falconry?

12:49.002 --> 12:50.969
Let me guess,
you took the class

12:50.971 --> 12:52.470
because your plan
is to deploy hawks

12:52.472 --> 12:54.372
in our next hostage
situation.

12:54.374 --> 12:55.940
Nah, raptors are just cool.

12:55.942 --> 12:57.075
ERIC:
Hey, guys.

12:57.077 --> 12:58.109
Kaleidoscope
just got a hit

12:58.111 --> 12:59.511
on Kouris'
silver Nissan.

12:59.513 --> 13:01.346
It's parked outside a
restaurant on Ventura.

13:01.348 --> 13:02.981
NELL:
And I was able to isolate

13:02.983 --> 13:05.083
the cell signal used
to control the drone.

13:05.085 --> 13:07.118
I then triangulated
the first ping

13:07.120 --> 13:08.153
to a garage in Long Beach.

13:08.155 --> 13:09.254
That's where it launched from.

13:09.256 --> 13:11.089
All right, we'll pick up Kouris.

13:11.091 --> 13:12.090
Send Kensi and Deeks
down to Long Beach.

13:12.092 --> 13:14.092
Got it.
Yeah.

13:22.202 --> 13:24.335
It's a pretty good place
to launch a small drone.

13:26.339 --> 13:28.006
Long Beach. The L-B-C.

13:28.008 --> 13:30.175
Home of Snoop Dogg
and the<i> Queen Mary.</i>

13:30.177 --> 13:32.010
My kind of town.

13:32.012 --> 13:33.878
Oh, no. Forget about
that haunted ship.

13:33.880 --> 13:35.880
Long Beach has
the El Dorado Skate Park.

13:35.882 --> 13:36.881
You know what that is?

13:36.883 --> 13:38.249
That's 15,000 feet

13:38.251 --> 13:40.151
of smooth concrete
skateboarding bliss.

13:40.153 --> 13:41.586
What is it with you
and skateboarding?

13:41.588 --> 13:43.221
What do you mean?
I mean, I get
the surfing thing,

13:43.223 --> 13:44.889
the ocean,
dolphins,

13:44.891 --> 13:46.074
the Zen stuff, blah,
blah, blah, blah, blah.

13:46.075 --> 13:47.258
"Zen stuff, blah, blah,
blah, blah, blah"?

13:47.260 --> 13:48.393
But kicking
a board

13:48.395 --> 13:49.594
down a dirty street
dodging cars?

13:49.596 --> 13:51.129
Not interesting.

13:51.131 --> 13:52.463
All right. But you and I,
skating a pool?

13:52.465 --> 13:54.165
You know what I mean?
The wind in your hair,

13:54.167 --> 13:55.283
flowing through
transitions?

13:55.284 --> 13:56.400
You do that once,
I guarantee you,

13:56.403 --> 13:57.502
you are gonna
be hooked.

13:57.504 --> 13:59.470
Okay. I'll trust you.

13:59.472 --> 14:01.039
I'll try it.

14:01.041 --> 14:02.240
Why not?

14:04.144 --> 14:05.476
Okay.

14:05.478 --> 14:07.212
I mean, I feel like
you're messing with me,

14:07.214 --> 14:09.113
but I'll... I'll set it up.

14:11.985 --> 14:13.418
How hard
can it be?

14:13.420 --> 14:15.153
I mean, you
can do it.

14:15.155 --> 14:16.087
Federal agents!

14:31.238 --> 14:32.237
Clear!

14:32.239 --> 14:34.138
Kens.

14:34.140 --> 14:36.074
(flies buzzing)

14:44.484 --> 14:45.984
SAM:
There's Kouris' car.

14:45.986 --> 14:50.121
Well, maybe he's in there
enjoying some moussaka.

14:50.123 --> 14:52.490
Maybe he's meeting
with some PK members.

14:52.492 --> 14:54.092
He's trained.

14:55.495 --> 14:58.129
You don't want a guy
like that running.

14:58.131 --> 15:00.231
Be best to box him in,
take him in the restaurant.

15:00.233 --> 15:02.200
Lot of civilians in there.

15:03.303 --> 15:06.137
You remember that sushi spot
in Thousand Oaks?

15:08.341 --> 15:10.241
That'll work.

15:10.243 --> 15:12.210
This time, we
switch roles.

15:24.090 --> 15:25.390
Ah.

15:25.392 --> 15:26.758
Table for one?

15:26.759 --> 15:28.125
Excuse me, I need to speak
with your manager, please.

15:28.128 --> 15:29.994
I am the
manager.
Oh, sir, pleasure
to meet you.

15:29.996 --> 15:31.195
I'm Steve Bishop.

15:31.197 --> 15:33.064
I am with the County
Health Inspector's Office.

15:33.066 --> 15:34.532
Oh, we've already had
our inspection.

15:34.534 --> 15:36.634
We got an "A" rating.
Yes.

15:36.636 --> 15:38.436
I'm, uh, very well
aware of that.

15:38.438 --> 15:40.071
That's, uh, why I'm here today.

15:40.073 --> 15:41.272
I'm afraid

15:41.274 --> 15:44.042
there has been
a small clerical error.

15:44.044 --> 15:45.209
Clerical error?

15:45.211 --> 15:47.178
You were given the wrong rating.

15:47.180 --> 15:48.713
Oh, what... what happened?

15:48.715 --> 15:50.648
I'm sorry, but I'm gonna need
to put the new sign up,

15:50.650 --> 15:53.384
with your, uh, revised grade.

15:53.386 --> 15:56.087
What kind of rating
are you giving us?

15:56.089 --> 15:57.155
You received a "C."

15:57.157 --> 15:58.556
Oh, oh...
And we're gonna need

15:58.558 --> 16:01.092
to have you close this down
until everything is resolved.

16:01.094 --> 16:02.293
Again, I-I-I'm
very sorry.

16:02.295 --> 16:03.294
A "C," "C"?
Why a "C"?

16:03.296 --> 16:04.429
We are always an "A."

16:04.431 --> 16:05.964
The rating was given due to...

16:05.966 --> 16:08.232
rodent infestation
of the food preparation area,

16:08.234 --> 16:12.303
insect infestation
of the refrigerated area, mold

16:12.305 --> 16:14.305
on and around...
Whoa, whoa. Excuse me.

16:14.307 --> 16:16.174
Did you just say
there were rodents

16:16.176 --> 16:18.209
and insects in the kitchen?
(chuckles)
Technically,

16:18.211 --> 16:20.345
it was rodents in the kitchen,
insects in the refrigerator.

16:20.347 --> 16:21.512
No...
What kind of rodents?

16:21.514 --> 16:23.414
No rodents.
Rats.
I don't have

16:23.416 --> 16:25.283
a good thing with rats.
WOMAN: Did he say "rats"?

16:25.285 --> 16:27.318
Look, were these rats near
my food? Be straight with me.
No, no.

16:27.320 --> 16:28.987
Wait. Wait.
Was it the brown ones
or the white ones?

16:28.989 --> 16:30.555
CALLEN:
I really, uh, can't go

16:30.557 --> 16:32.256
into specifics.
Not the ones with
the red eyes.

16:32.258 --> 16:33.725
MANAGER:
No, no, no.

16:33.726 --> 16:35.193
No rodents, no
rodents. Wait, wait.

16:35.195 --> 16:36.260
Hey, red eyes ain't right.
Don't leave. Don't
leave. There's...

16:36.262 --> 16:37.261
You see what
you did?

16:37.263 --> 16:39.630
Get out of here.
What?

16:39.632 --> 16:41.165
Now.

16:41.167 --> 16:43.034
Take the busboy with you.

16:43.036 --> 16:45.103
Come.

16:50.777 --> 16:53.311
CALLEN:
Frank Kouris.

16:53.313 --> 16:57.015
Want to tell us
what you're doing in L.A.?

16:58.251 --> 17:02.320
The health inspectors in
America, they speak like cops.

17:02.322 --> 17:03.054
Federal agents.

17:03.056 --> 17:04.522
Weapons out.

17:04.524 --> 17:06.057
On the ground.

17:06.493 --> 17:07.358
Gun.

17:07.360 --> 17:09.794
(gunshots)

17:18.138 --> 17:19.337
I got these two. Go.

17:19.339 --> 17:21.139
Get Kouris.

17:25.111 --> 17:26.310
Federal agent!

17:26.312 --> 17:27.178
Out of the way, out of the way.

17:40.093 --> 17:41.292
(grunts)

17:43.463 --> 17:46.164
(grunting)

18:06.352 --> 18:07.251
You good?

18:10.156 --> 18:11.823
I'm good.

18:11.825 --> 18:13.191
What took you so long?

18:13.193 --> 18:15.226
I mean, you just
had the one guy,

18:15.228 --> 18:16.360
right?

18:16.362 --> 18:17.728
Not in the mood.

18:17.730 --> 18:21.199
My two guys are cuffed
to a table back there.

18:21.201 --> 18:23.835
I also rounded up the busboy
and the manager for questioning.

18:23.837 --> 18:26.270
I got hit with a can
of Turtle Wax.

18:26.272 --> 18:27.438
You ever get hit
with a can

18:27.440 --> 18:28.606
of Turtle Wax?

18:29.642 --> 18:31.609
I didn't think so.

18:43.790 --> 18:46.457
I come to Los Angeles
for a vacation.

18:46.459 --> 18:50.461
I watch TMZ,
and it looks like fun place.

18:50.463 --> 18:52.630
You entered the U.S.
five months ago

18:52.632 --> 18:54.632
and you've been
underground since.

18:54.633 --> 18:56.633
That does not sound like
much of a vacation to me.

18:56.636 --> 18:59.904
Eh, that depend
on your frame of reference.

18:59.906 --> 19:01.839
A guy that betrayed
your organization was blown up

19:01.841 --> 19:04.142
while you were parked
right outside.

19:04.144 --> 19:05.810
Explain that.

19:05.812 --> 19:07.678
No, I don't have to.

19:07.680 --> 19:11.482
In America, that is called,
uh, circumstantial evidence.

19:11.484 --> 19:13.718
I also watch the<i> Matlock.</i>

19:13.720 --> 19:15.453
That's a good point.

19:15.455 --> 19:18.222
Besides, you didn't come here
five months ago to kill Minas.

19:18.224 --> 19:19.924
You were here before he even
entered the country.

19:19.926 --> 19:21.792
So I'm wondering,

19:21.794 --> 19:23.761
what is PK
planning?

19:23.763 --> 19:25.930
And why'd they send you here?
Nobody

19:25.932 --> 19:28.733
send me anywhere.

19:28.735 --> 19:30.768
Hey,
my friend,

19:30.770 --> 19:34.405
do you know where I can get
a picture with Yanni?

19:34.407 --> 19:35.406
(chuckles)

19:35.408 --> 19:37.775
Yanni.
That's funny.

19:37.777 --> 19:39.877
You and your two buddies
aren't talking. I get it.

19:39.879 --> 19:41.879
None of you have anything
to lose.

19:41.881 --> 19:43.614
Your nephew,
on the other hand,

19:43.616 --> 19:45.783
just got accepted into Stanford.

19:45.785 --> 19:47.652
CALLEN:
Impressive.

19:47.654 --> 19:49.854
SAM:
Kid like that has
got a lot to lose.

19:49.856 --> 19:51.856
Future's bright.

19:51.858 --> 19:53.791
CALLEN:
You're in this
life already.

19:53.793 --> 19:55.793
And you're going away
for a long time.

19:55.795 --> 19:57.762
Why do you want to make us drag
your sister and your nephew

19:57.764 --> 20:01.732
into this?
You-you don't talk
to my sister, okay?

20:02.936 --> 20:06.270
She raised a good boy.
You leave him be.

20:06.272 --> 20:07.605
PK wanted you in L.A.
for a reason

20:07.607 --> 20:09.273
that had nothing to do
with Minas.

20:09.275 --> 20:10.942
But when they found out
he was here,

20:10.944 --> 20:12.777
you got the call to kill him.

20:12.779 --> 20:14.946
What do you want to know?

20:14.948 --> 20:16.881
SAM:
How did you
find Minas?

20:16.883 --> 20:18.883
His weakness.

20:18.885 --> 20:21.886
Okay, you want to track a man,
you find his weakness.

20:21.888 --> 20:23.688
Minas loved women.

20:23.690 --> 20:26.040
Yeah,
he always do.

20:26.041 --> 20:28.391
My brothers, they find one
of his girlfriend in Athens

20:28.394 --> 20:31.796
and they... convince her
to help us.

20:31.798 --> 20:33.397
She knew he
was in L.A.?

20:33.399 --> 20:36.000
Yeah, the idiot, he tell her
that he gonna fly her over

20:36.002 --> 20:37.835
to see him
in a few months, so...

20:37.837 --> 20:40.805
I track him to an apartment

20:40.807 --> 20:43.874
and then I follow him
to that hotel where he hook up

20:43.876 --> 20:45.509
with another girl there.

20:45.511 --> 20:46.410
What apartment?

20:46.412 --> 20:49.347
Some rat hole off of, um,

20:49.349 --> 20:50.748
Washington.

20:50.750 --> 20:53.384
Look, guys, that's all
that happened, huh?

20:53.386 --> 20:54.852
That's it.
Yeah?

20:54.854 --> 20:57.521
You left out the part
where you blew him up.

20:57.523 --> 20:59.991
Minas deserved to die.

20:59.993 --> 21:03.794
He-He's a man who is loyal
to the highest bidder.

21:03.796 --> 21:05.896
We never expect
that he gonna be greedy

21:05.898 --> 21:07.832
or so stupid
to betray us.

21:07.834 --> 21:09.900
But, no, man,
I did not kill him.

21:09.902 --> 21:11.736
PK did not kill him.

21:11.738 --> 21:13.871
Someone beat us to it.

21:13.873 --> 21:15.273
That's all.

21:15.275 --> 21:16.741
You almost sound convincing.

21:16.743 --> 21:18.776
Ah, come on.

21:18.778 --> 21:20.978
I would never use explosive.

21:20.980 --> 21:22.980
If I going to kill him,

21:22.982 --> 21:26.884
I going to do it with a knife,
so I can see his eyes.

21:32.525 --> 21:33.524
Hey, guys.

21:33.526 --> 21:35.293
The body Kensi and Deeks found

21:35.294 --> 21:37.061
at the location where the drone
was launched was just ID'd

21:37.063 --> 21:38.763
as the owner of the building.

21:38.765 --> 21:39.897
We're gonna dig into his past,

21:39.899 --> 21:41.666
see if we find
any criminal ties.

21:41.668 --> 21:42.767
All right, thanks, Nell.

21:42.769 --> 21:43.902
No problem.

21:43.903 --> 21:45.036
The owner could have been
working with Minas.

21:45.038 --> 21:46.671
Either that or it was a case

21:46.673 --> 21:48.506
of "wrong place
at the wrong time."

21:48.508 --> 21:50.641
You buy what
Kouris just told us?

21:50.643 --> 21:51.976
Guy like that?

21:51.978 --> 21:54.679
Nah, he couldn't help himself.

21:54.681 --> 21:56.580
If he did Minas,
he'd want us to know.

21:56.582 --> 21:59.016
So, if PK didn't kill him,

21:59.018 --> 22:00.451
who did?

22:00.453 --> 22:01.585
I don't know.

22:01.587 --> 22:05.790
But Kouris trailed Minas
to that apartment on Washington.

22:05.792 --> 22:07.024
That's a good place to start.

22:11.998 --> 22:14.799
So, how was it out in the
field with Callen and Sam?

22:14.801 --> 22:15.900
Good.

22:15.902 --> 22:17.768
Did you miss me?

22:17.770 --> 22:20.037
Oh, every single
solitary second.

22:20.039 --> 22:22.073
Come on, no one knows
those drones better than you.

22:22.075 --> 22:24.008
I was happy to loan you out.

22:24.010 --> 22:25.676
Loan me out?

22:25.678 --> 22:27.745
Yeah, I own you now,
didn't you get the memo?

22:27.747 --> 22:28.946
Oh, yeah, I got it.

22:30.083 --> 22:31.582
Got to tell you,

22:31.584 --> 22:32.917
I've always been a
little embarrassed

22:32.919 --> 22:34.585
about those
aerobatics titles.

22:35.922 --> 22:37.355
I mean, they're kind of nerdy.

22:37.357 --> 22:39.056
Even for me.

22:39.058 --> 22:40.892
Oh, please.
If that were me,

22:40.893 --> 22:42.727
I'd have, like, a full-on
championship belt made.

22:42.728 --> 22:44.562
Like, a sash with, like,
a crown and a scepter.

22:44.564 --> 22:46.030
And, like, a ticker-tape...
(beep)

22:46.032 --> 22:47.064
Chauvenet.

22:47.066 --> 22:49.100
NELL:
Huh?

22:53.539 --> 22:54.872
When Kouris said

22:54.874 --> 22:57.141
that Minas would sell out
for the highest bidder,

22:57.143 --> 22:59.377
I decided to run a search
though the database

22:59.379 --> 23:01.479
of that, uh, Darknet site
that we took offline,

23:01.481 --> 23:02.947
Chauvenet.
Mm-hmm.

23:02.949 --> 23:04.482
There's a part
of the site

23:04.484 --> 23:07.051
where you can hire
someone to commit crimes.

23:07.053 --> 23:09.987
Minas had
an encrypted account.

23:09.989 --> 23:11.555
Hmm, nice work, Bealeski.

23:11.557 --> 23:12.790
Yeah.

23:12.792 --> 23:14.091
And get this--

23:14.093 --> 23:16.527
he was paid $50,000
in Bitcoins.

23:16.529 --> 23:18.562
Okay, the whole
thing's encrypted,

23:18.564 --> 23:21.966
but let me try
to find out who paid him.

23:21.968 --> 23:23.918
So, Minas had
experience in plotting

23:23.919 --> 23:25.869
successful terrorist attacks
against the United States.

23:25.872 --> 23:28.038
Yeah, pretty small fraternity
of people who can claim that.

23:28.040 --> 23:30.040
Exactly.

23:30.041 --> 23:32.041
So, if he's offering his
services to the highest bidder,

23:32.044 --> 23:33.978
don't you think
he could have earned

23:33.980 --> 23:36.013
a little more than $50,000?

23:41.087 --> 23:43.087
Hey, Deeks?

23:43.089 --> 23:46.090
DEEKS:
Yeah.

23:46.091 --> 23:49.092
Didn't Nell say that the drone
was made of carbon fiber?

23:49.095 --> 23:50.995
Yes.

23:50.997 --> 23:54.598
Well, I have bags of
carbon fiber here,

23:54.600 --> 23:56.967
soldering iron, epoxy.

23:56.969 --> 23:59.170
They didn't just
launch it from here,

23:59.172 --> 24:01.472
drone was built here.

24:01.474 --> 24:03.341
Something
doesn't add up.

24:03.342 --> 24:05.209
Eric and Nell couldn't find
any criminal ties to the owner.

24:05.211 --> 24:07.011
By all accounts, he's
an upstanding citizen.

24:07.013 --> 24:10.080
So, what is it that's so
special about this place,

24:10.082 --> 24:12.750
they had to break in and kill
the owner just to gain access?

24:12.752 --> 24:14.919
I mean, there's lots
of empty garages around here.

24:14.921 --> 24:18.656
Right, but the owner could
have surprised them, or, uh...

24:18.658 --> 24:19.990
maybe the killer's
just sick.

24:19.992 --> 24:21.625
Oh, that's
for sure, but...

24:21.627 --> 24:22.693
Wait a minute.

24:24.163 --> 24:25.596
What?
What do you got?

24:25.598 --> 24:27.198
My buddy owns
a custom car shop.

24:27.200 --> 24:29.033
He says that you can
form carbon fiber

24:29.035 --> 24:32.002
into any shape, you just need
an oven to cure it.

24:32.004 --> 24:34.054
Okay.

24:34.055 --> 24:36.105
That's great, but the drone was
20 inches long.

24:36.108 --> 24:38.943
You wouldn't need
an industrial oven this size.

24:40.847 --> 24:42.913
Unless...

24:48.955 --> 24:51.021
Put it down there.

24:57.597 --> 24:59.864
Oh, you've got
to be kidding me.

25:09.041 --> 25:11.108
You'd need an oven that big...

25:14.881 --> 25:16.113
...if you were making...

25:16.115 --> 25:17.581
(grunts)

25:23.990 --> 25:26.090
...a much larger drone.

25:26.092 --> 25:29.159
The drone that killed Minas
looked exactly like this,

25:29.161 --> 25:30.594
except for it was smaller.

25:30.596 --> 25:31.595
It's a scale model.

25:31.597 --> 25:33.831
$50,000 is not a lot of money

25:33.833 --> 25:35.833
to pay him to carry out
a terrorist attack,

25:35.835 --> 25:38.168
but it's pretty good money
for a proof of concept.

25:38.170 --> 25:41.272
And after he delivers the
full-scale drone to the buyer,

25:41.274 --> 25:45.175
then they just use the original
proof of concept to kill him.

25:45.177 --> 25:46.544
Close the loop.

25:46.546 --> 25:47.811
Smart.

25:47.813 --> 25:50.981
And all the evidence
leads back to Minas.

25:50.983 --> 25:54.151
Who just happens
to also be the victim.

25:57.857 --> 26:00.724
Question is-- who was
he building it for?

26:13.873 --> 26:16.874
15-foot drone made
of carbon fiber?

26:16.876 --> 26:19.043
Carry upwards of five
pounds of explosives.

26:19.045 --> 26:21.111
Maybe more, depending
on the distance.

26:21.113 --> 26:23.280
If it's loaded with five
pounds of that same stuff

26:23.282 --> 26:25.783
that blew up Minas, they're
looking at a lot bigger target

26:25.785 --> 26:27.084
and a lot more casualties.

26:27.086 --> 26:28.752
Finding out who Minas
was working for

26:28.754 --> 26:30.588
is our best shot
at finding the drone.

26:30.590 --> 26:32.856
Here's the apartment where
Kouris said he followed him to.

26:48.274 --> 26:50.207
(knocking)

26:50.208 --> 26:52.141
Excuse me, we're doing some
painting in the neighborhood

26:52.144 --> 26:54.345
and wanted to know
if you wanted a free estimate.
(muffled clattering)

26:55.848 --> 26:56.847
He's headed out the back.
Head him off.

27:01.220 --> 27:03.020
Federal agent.
Drop the gun.

27:23.943 --> 27:26.710
Who was the guy
Callen and Sam had to take down?

27:26.712 --> 27:27.811
His name's
Eric Swanson.

27:27.813 --> 27:29.246
He's a member of
a fringe group

27:29.248 --> 27:30.914
called Live
Free First.

27:30.916 --> 27:32.116
And what's that?

27:32.118 --> 27:35.886
It's a cult
based out of Cleburne, Texas.

27:35.888 --> 27:38.088
It's run by this guy,
Rand Palmer.

27:38.090 --> 27:39.857
Live Free First
is declaring war

27:39.859 --> 27:41.258
on the ones
that control everything

27:41.260 --> 27:42.960
from natural resources

27:42.962 --> 27:44.895
to money.

27:44.897 --> 27:47.064
In the past, countries
like the great United States

27:47.066 --> 27:48.866
controlled these things.

27:48.868 --> 27:50.134
Charismatic fella.
But today they're all

27:50.136 --> 27:51.802
owned by corporations.

27:51.804 --> 27:53.904
We're declaring war
on these corporations.

27:53.906 --> 27:55.973
Palmer has stated
that he believes

27:55.975 --> 27:59.677
the capitals of corporate greed
are New York and Los Angeles.

27:59.679 --> 28:01.345
Looks like we
found out who Minas

28:01.347 --> 28:02.846
was building the drone for.

28:02.848 --> 28:04.848
Kensi and Deeks
just sent over images of the

28:04.850 --> 28:08.385
carbon fiber molds.
And I put them in
a modeling program.

28:08.387 --> 28:09.887
Minas attended
the University of Patras

28:09.889 --> 28:12.890
studying aeronautics,
which explains his

28:12.892 --> 28:15.826
impressive work.
Now, this drone

28:15.828 --> 28:18.696
is most likely being
operated on a 3G connection

28:18.698 --> 28:20.397
just like the one
that killed Minas.

28:20.399 --> 28:23.267
Meaning that its range
is virtually unlimited,

28:23.269 --> 28:25.769
and it could go on
as long as its fuel lasts.

28:25.771 --> 28:29.206
We need to narrow the playing
field and find this thing.

28:29.208 --> 28:31.442
(sighs)

28:33.412 --> 28:35.946
We're not gonna be able to get
anything off the computers

28:35.948 --> 28:37.414
inside the apartment.

28:37.415 --> 28:38.881
They were smashed open
and the hard drives

28:38.884 --> 28:41.018
were doused with
hydrochloric acid.
Mm.

28:41.020 --> 28:44.188
I got nothing.
He's clean.

28:44.190 --> 28:45.956
No phone.

28:45.958 --> 28:47.191
They didn't have the finances
or the connections

28:47.193 --> 28:49.059
to hack into a military drone.

28:49.061 --> 28:51.328
Hiring Minas to build their own
was a pretty good option.

28:51.330 --> 28:54.732
Live Free First didn't want any
links between them and Minas.
So they

28:54.734 --> 28:56.433
pay him for proof of concept,
but then they kill him

28:56.435 --> 28:58.135
before they have to pony up
for the real deal.

28:58.137 --> 29:01.038
Minas had traitorous tendencies.
He showed that.

29:01.040 --> 29:02.873
Maybe they didn't trust him.

29:02.875 --> 29:04.942
It's a pretty good bet.

29:10.850 --> 29:12.850
I got one of these.

29:12.852 --> 29:16.253
It's a hiking watch.

29:16.255 --> 29:19.189
It's got an
altimeter, compass.

29:19.191 --> 29:21.191
Also tells you
where you went.

29:21.193 --> 29:24.495
GPS. Nice.

29:25.998 --> 29:28.465
The town is full of viable
targets for that drone.

29:28.467 --> 29:32.169
Big events today at Staples
Center, Dodger Stadium and UCLA.

29:32.171 --> 29:34.938
Not to mention malls,
studios, tourist spots.

29:34.940 --> 29:36.373
It's a target-rich environment
for Live Free First

29:36.375 --> 29:38.809
to start their war
on corporations.

29:38.811 --> 29:41.011
I hate those things.
What-- cults or corporations?

29:41.013 --> 29:44.148
Both. Well, cults more.

29:44.150 --> 29:45.949
These guys
went to a lot

29:45.951 --> 29:48.519
of trouble to hire Minas
to build that drone.

29:48.521 --> 29:50.154
KENSI:
And now we're
closing in on them.

29:50.156 --> 29:52.823
So, what would you do

29:52.825 --> 29:54.525
if you were Palmer?

29:54.527 --> 29:57.060
I would get that drone
in the air as soon as possible.

29:57.062 --> 29:59.062
Kensi, you ready?

29:59.064 --> 30:01.465
Yes, I downloaded
the app for the watch.

30:03.569 --> 30:06.570
Here we go-- here's the GPS
data from this morning.

30:06.572 --> 30:09.973
Swanson was at the Long Beach
garage, same time

30:09.975 --> 30:11.441
as the explosion
at the hotel.

30:11.443 --> 30:13.510
Probably piloting the drone
that killed Minas.

30:13.512 --> 30:15.879
CALLEN:
Where did Swanson go
after the explosion?

30:17.416 --> 30:21.118
That's the trail going to the
apartment where we found him.

30:21.120 --> 30:23.053
Let's look at the old routes
from the past week.

30:23.989 --> 30:26.123
Zoom in to the area
near Long Beach.

30:28.127 --> 30:29.493
He went to
that place

30:29.495 --> 30:31.562
a few times in the last week.
Looks like an

30:31.564 --> 30:33.463
open space-- a field, maybe.
Let me check it out. Hang on.

30:38.237 --> 30:39.937
City's building
a recycling plant there.

30:42.274 --> 30:45.375
He's doing a recon.
Perfect place to launch a drone.

30:45.377 --> 30:47.344
I'll alert the FAA
and Homeland.

30:47.346 --> 30:48.912
Let's move.

30:51.350 --> 30:53.317
Sitrep, Owen.

30:55.888 --> 30:58.088
I assume you're not
referring to the drone.

31:03.395 --> 31:06.096
There is no sign
that anyone on this team

31:06.098 --> 31:08.932
is leaking your
planted information.

31:08.934 --> 31:11.235
But we're still no closer
to finding our mole.

31:25.517 --> 31:27.117
There they are.

31:31.457 --> 31:32.589
MAN:
Boss, we got company.

31:32.591 --> 31:34.591
I need more time.
Take care of 'em.

31:53.579 --> 31:55.579
That's Palmer in the van!

31:55.581 --> 31:57.014
SAM:
Drone's gaining speed!

31:57.016 --> 31:58.382
It's taking off!

32:10.529 --> 32:13.096
Pilot's in the van.

32:32.151 --> 32:34.985
The drone is headed west.

32:34.987 --> 32:38.689
It's not banking
towards downtown or Hollywood.

32:40.359 --> 32:41.725
GRANGER:
They're going after

32:41.727 --> 32:43.727
the South Shore Oil Refinery.

32:43.729 --> 32:45.729
It's about as corporate
as you can get.

32:45.731 --> 32:47.998
Alert the refinery and
get L.A. Fire rolling now.

32:48.000 --> 32:50.434
Copy.
CALLEN: There's not gonna be
anything they can do.

32:50.436 --> 32:52.069
The refinery
doesn't have systems

32:52.071 --> 32:53.270
in place to stop a drone attack.

32:53.272 --> 32:55.072
That's why it's
not gonna get there.

32:55.074 --> 32:58.041
ERIC: Guys, if one of the
refinery's gas tanks blows up,

32:58.043 --> 32:59.376
it'll most likely set off
a chain reaction.

32:59.378 --> 33:00.978
How many kilotons
are we looking at?

33:00.980 --> 33:02.412
Close to three kilotons

33:02.414 --> 33:04.181
in a highly populated community.

33:04.183 --> 33:07.517
Okay, in Texas City in 1947,
there was a 2.7

33:07.519 --> 33:10.721
kiloton explosion
of ammonium nitrate and oil.

33:10.723 --> 33:13.090
The blast leveled
1,000 buildings

33:13.092 --> 33:15.993
and killed over 500 people.

33:15.995 --> 33:18.295
CALLEN: Gun!
(gunfire)

33:24.136 --> 33:27.104
SAM:
<i> We're coming up</i>
<i> right behind you.</i>

33:41.353 --> 33:44.121
Nice shot, Deeks.
Kensi, you guys good?

33:45.057 --> 33:46.523
Yeah, we're all good.

33:46.525 --> 33:48.492
But I think the axle's busted.

33:49.762 --> 33:51.395
Look out!

33:53.632 --> 33:55.132
We can take them here.

34:21.560 --> 34:24.161
Go! Get Palmer! Get Palmer!

34:26.698 --> 34:28.432
Federal agent!

34:39.111 --> 34:41.678
Federal agent!

34:41.680 --> 34:43.680
Turn around slowly!

34:43.682 --> 34:45.515
You're already too late.

34:45.517 --> 34:47.317
Drone's on its approach.

34:47.319 --> 34:49.453
Let's burn in hell.

35:01.200 --> 35:03.800
Palmer is down.

35:03.802 --> 35:05.836
I got the drone's controller.

35:05.838 --> 35:07.437
Callen, the drone's over

35:07.439 --> 35:09.172
Seaside, headed
for the refinery.

35:11.343 --> 35:13.176
You can't bring it down
over that area.

35:13.178 --> 35:14.578
Too many civilians.

35:14.580 --> 35:16.279
We could land it here
at this construction site.

35:16.281 --> 35:17.747
There's plenty of empty land.

35:17.749 --> 35:19.282
Can you control it?

35:19.284 --> 35:21.751
I need some help here, Nell.

35:21.753 --> 35:24.554
Okay, tell me exactly

35:24.556 --> 35:26.289
what you see
on the tablet's screen.

35:26.291 --> 35:28.625
Nothing. The screen is dead.

35:28.627 --> 35:30.827
Okay, press your thumbs down

35:30.829 --> 35:32.863
on the lower right and left-hand
corners of the screen

35:32.865 --> 35:35.265
at the same time.

35:35.267 --> 35:36.800
These are your control sticks.

35:36.802 --> 35:39.236
We need to see if this tablet
is still operable.

35:39.238 --> 35:40.721
Okay.

35:40.722 --> 35:42.205
As soon as you do that,
autopilot is disengaged,

35:42.207 --> 35:45.242
and you will be in complete
control of the drone.

35:45.244 --> 35:47.244
All right, copy that.
Doing it now.

35:48.780 --> 35:50.547
We're losing altitude.
Drone's dropping fast.

35:50.549 --> 35:53.183
CALLEN:
Talk to me, Nell.

35:53.185 --> 35:55.752
All right,
tilt the screen towards you.

35:55.754 --> 35:57.487
Slowly.

35:59.925 --> 36:02.726
Good news is you
just leveled out.

36:02.728 --> 36:04.995
Bad news is I'm flying blind?

36:04.996 --> 36:07.263
Yup. The screen's dead,
but the tablet is still alive.

36:07.266 --> 36:10.167
The gyro is still
controlling the altitude.

36:10.169 --> 36:11.835
All right,
how do I turn this thing?

36:11.837 --> 36:14.204
Apply pressure
to the left thumb control.

36:14.206 --> 36:17.941
Now, slowly bank it
to the right.

36:20.312 --> 36:23.246
You're doing great.
It's turning.

36:23.248 --> 36:24.414
Hold that line, Callen.

36:24.416 --> 36:25.549
It's heading back towards

36:25.551 --> 36:27.617
the construction site.

36:31.657 --> 36:33.957
Dump it in the northeast corner
of the lot.

36:33.959 --> 36:36.259
I have eyes on the drone.

36:36.261 --> 36:38.295
I've lost control.

36:38.297 --> 36:39.696
The gyro's not responding.

36:39.698 --> 36:41.598
Drone's heading
towards the dock!

36:41.600 --> 36:42.699
NELL:
The drone went offline.

36:42.701 --> 36:44.534
Callen, we need to reconnect it.

36:44.536 --> 36:46.269
Press down on both thumb keys

36:46.271 --> 36:48.805
at the same time.

36:48.807 --> 36:51.541
Now try the upper
left-hand corner.

36:51.543 --> 36:53.443
Okay, I'm back online.

36:56.415 --> 36:58.982
It's heading towards me,
but I...

36:58.984 --> 37:00.483
I'm not controlling it.

37:00.485 --> 37:02.586
The homing function was engaged
when the tablet

37:02.588 --> 37:03.720
went back online.

37:03.722 --> 37:05.255
It's coming for the tablet.

37:05.257 --> 37:06.823
Blast radius?

37:06.825 --> 37:07.857
100 feet.

37:20.372 --> 37:24.007
GRANGER:
Callen?

37:24.009 --> 37:25.609
Callen, do you copy?!

37:30.415 --> 37:32.449
I'm good.

37:34.886 --> 37:36.553
SAM:
<i> All I'm saying is,</i>

37:36.555 --> 37:38.722
you had all those
acres of open land,

37:38.724 --> 37:40.890
and you had to bring that thing
down right next to all of us.

37:40.892 --> 37:43.360
It was full of explosives and
I was flying it blind.

37:43.362 --> 37:45.328
(laughs)

37:45.330 --> 37:46.663
Let's take the "it's gonna

37:46.665 --> 37:48.598
blow the whole world up"
thing out of the equation.

37:48.600 --> 37:50.400
Flying that drone was
pretty cool, right?

37:50.402 --> 37:51.468
Don't.

37:51.470 --> 37:52.602
Don't what?

37:52.604 --> 37:54.304
Don't go out and buy
one of those things.

37:54.306 --> 37:56.339
Nah, that's not my thing.

37:56.341 --> 37:58.775
I was just curious how you
felt about it, that's all.

37:58.777 --> 38:00.977
It was pretty cool.

38:00.979 --> 38:02.712
That's what
I thought.
Mm-hmm.

38:02.714 --> 38:04.414
So, I went
searching online.

38:04.416 --> 38:06.583
We should get a
drone of our own.

38:06.585 --> 38:09.486
Go in 50-50.

38:09.488 --> 38:11.888
A drone of our own?

38:11.890 --> 38:14.424
I hate robots,
any kind of robot.

38:14.426 --> 38:15.625
Why do you think

38:15.627 --> 38:18.061
I returned that-that
Roomba thing you gave me?

38:18.063 --> 38:21.298
So, you don't want to join
a drone club, maybe enter

38:21.300 --> 38:25.001
a competition, have a little
high-altitude family photo time?

38:25.003 --> 38:27.537
(laughing)
How do you know
you weren't meant

38:27.539 --> 38:28.772
to fly one of
these things?

38:28.774 --> 38:31.374
Don't fight your destiny, G.

38:31.376 --> 38:33.910
Don't fight it!

38:33.912 --> 38:36.479
Granger said

38:36.481 --> 38:38.448
you wanted to see me?

38:38.450 --> 38:41.718
I do. Let's sit.

38:41.720 --> 38:44.321
Okay.

38:44.323 --> 38:46.623
It's been a long day.

38:46.625 --> 38:49.592
Take a load off, Ms. Jones.

38:49.594 --> 38:51.661
All right.

38:54.032 --> 38:57.467
What you did today...

38:57.469 --> 39:00.537
what you've consistently
been contributing,

39:00.539 --> 39:02.972
has not gone... unnoticed.

39:02.974 --> 39:04.874
Oh.

39:04.876 --> 39:08.812
Well, I was just trying
to help the team.

39:11.049 --> 39:13.717
Is this whiskey?

39:13.719 --> 39:15.518
Pappy Van Winkle.

39:15.520 --> 39:17.587
Oh, boy.

39:20.392 --> 39:22.392
Wow.

39:22.394 --> 39:24.394
I didn't think I liked whiskey.

39:24.396 --> 39:26.463
For four generations,

39:26.465 --> 39:30.533
the Van Winkles of Kentucky
have been making whiskey.

39:30.535 --> 39:32.435
But not like anyone else,

39:32.437 --> 39:35.405
they use wheat instead of rye.

39:35.407 --> 39:38.041
Well, thank you for
sharing it with me.

39:38.043 --> 39:40.377
I'm sure you're aware

39:40.379 --> 39:43.046
that a multitude of

39:43.048 --> 39:46.583
potential undercover agents
have come under my command

39:46.585 --> 39:48.451
over the years.

39:48.453 --> 39:50.153
Yes, ma'am.

39:50.155 --> 39:52.155
Most of them viewed

39:52.157 --> 39:54.491
their predecessors as road maps.

39:54.493 --> 39:57.861
They read their résumés
as recipes to be followed.

39:57.863 --> 40:00.430
But you've never

40:00.432 --> 40:02.532
made an effort to do that.

40:02.534 --> 40:06.169
No. No, I haven't.

40:06.171 --> 40:09.739
But you still want
to do covert work?

40:09.741 --> 40:11.908
Be an undercover agent?

40:11.910 --> 40:15.445
Yes. More than anything, I do.

40:15.447 --> 40:17.447
But you don't want to get there

40:17.449 --> 40:19.949
doing it as it's been done?

40:19.951 --> 40:23.486
I don't know if I can.

40:24.456 --> 40:26.189
So, you'd risk

40:26.191 --> 40:29.859
not attaining
the goal you hold most dear,

40:29.861 --> 40:32.562
because you feel

40:32.564 --> 40:36.566
compelled
to follow your own path?

40:36.568 --> 40:38.635
(laughs)

40:40.939 --> 40:42.972
I'm not big

40:42.974 --> 40:46.443
or overwhelmingly athletic.

40:46.445 --> 40:49.579
I'm not an amazing sniper.

40:50.782 --> 40:53.583
To be honest with you, Hetty,

40:53.585 --> 40:56.052
going in undercover scares me.

40:57.022 --> 40:59.155
I'm never going
to be like

40:59.157 --> 41:01.491
the others, and I know that.

41:01.493 --> 41:05.128
I can't do the things that they
do in the way that they do them,

41:05.130 --> 41:07.464
because... (sighs)

41:07.466 --> 41:10.467
...I have to do them my way,

41:10.469 --> 41:13.069
even if that means

41:13.071 --> 41:15.805
never making it.

41:18.743 --> 41:22.579
Amazing what happened...

41:22.581 --> 41:27.050
when the Van Winkles
made whiskey... their way.

41:30.922 --> 41:34.224
Hmm.

41:34.226 --> 41:36.493
(footsteps approaching)

41:38.630 --> 41:41.531
Drink up... Ms. Jones.

41:41.533 --> 41:43.633
Yes, ma'am.

41:43.635 --> 41:45.668
ERIC:
Hey, there's
my partner.

41:45.670 --> 41:48.104
Nice flying, Nell.

41:49.074 --> 41:51.207
You did the hard part.

41:52.110 --> 41:53.610
Way to go, sister.

41:53.612 --> 41:55.078
Thanks, lady.

41:55.079 --> 41:56.545
Wait a second, is that...?
Am I seeing libations here?

41:56.548 --> 41:57.947
My treat

41:57.949 --> 41:59.782
for my team.

41:59.784 --> 42:02.519
Good job.

42:02.821 --> 42:03.953
There's, uh,

42:03.955 --> 42:05.622
some Maker's
in my cabinet.
