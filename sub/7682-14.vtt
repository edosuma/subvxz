01:10.010 --> 01:12.846
Three and a half weeks,

01:13.013 --> 01:15.140
two continents, five countries,

01:15.140 --> 01:19.728
one island, about 9, 000 miles,
and I was wasted.

01:20.646 --> 01:25.275
Right now I was looking forward to
miles and miles of nothing happening...

01:25.275 --> 01:27.194
...except sleep.

01:27.194 --> 01:29.821
Welcome home!

01:29.988 --> 01:31.198
No.

01:31.198 --> 01:33.617
Oh, the man's
overcome with emotion.

01:33.617 --> 01:36.244
No, just overcome.

01:36.870 --> 01:41.041
It's nice to be back, great to see you,
but I need to get some sleep. Now.

01:41.041 --> 01:43.377
Not so fast.
I have fantastic news.

01:43.377 --> 01:47.089
I don't want to hear it, Jack.
I just want to sleep.

01:47.089 --> 01:50.092
So goodbye, Jack.
Go home, Jack.

01:50.133 --> 01:52.761
Actually, this is home.

01:54.763 --> 01:58.975
Temporarily. A reversal of fortune,
pileup of evil coincidences.

01:58.975 --> 02:01.645
I knew you wouldn't mind,
so I sort of moved in.

02:01.645 --> 02:04.481
Lucky I did too
because, old buddy, best pal,

02:04.481 --> 02:07.108
we have hit the jackpot.

02:07.734 --> 02:10.946
I taped this with my own lily whites,
from the 1 1.00 news.

02:10.946 --> 02:13.531
Jack! The answer is no.

02:13.531 --> 02:16.409
No rescue missions,
no buried treasure,

02:16.409 --> 02:18.620
no sunken gold,
no oil wells.

02:18.620 --> 02:20.497
- No.
- You're right, MacGyver.

02:20.497 --> 02:23.208
You're a practical man.
You're gonna love this.

02:23.208 --> 02:26.044
Jack, I don't want to see anything.

02:26.044 --> 02:28.546
- Please.
- I just taped the high points.

02:28.546 --> 02:30.924
And here they are,
the Lupescu jewels.

02:30.924 --> 02:32.884
Emeralds, rubies, diamonds.

02:32.884 --> 02:35.303
The most famous relics
of a royal family,

02:35.303 --> 02:40.683
purchased earlier today
at the Warwick Auction for $32 million.

02:40.683 --> 02:44.938
The reported buyer is one of the world's
wealthiest women, Elena Iturbe,

02:44.938 --> 02:46.731
heiress to a shipping fortune

02:46.731 --> 02:53.154
and alleged to be the mysterious
purchaser of these fabulous treasures.

02:55.740 --> 02:57.909
What? No!

02:57.909 --> 02:59.994
Oh, I just taped over
some old movie.

02:59.994 --> 03:02.246
My classic Western collection!

03:02.246 --> 03:04.832
Oh, sorry.

03:06.000 --> 03:09.086
Forget the past
because, my boy, we have a future.

03:09.086 --> 03:11.672
With those royal jewels?

03:11.756 --> 03:13.382
- No.
- Of course, no.

03:13.382 --> 03:17.178
Never mind small things. We have
a future with Ms Elena Iturbe.

03:17.178 --> 03:21.224
She flew in for that auction, used
some petty cash to buy those pretties.

03:21.224 --> 03:23.559
The pilots
of her private jet went south.

03:23.559 --> 03:25.269
I don't want to hear this.

03:25.269 --> 03:27.980
I checked it out at the airport.
Kosher, A-OK.

03:27.980 --> 03:31.901
- The plane's there. We're signed up.
- What about her flight crew?

03:31.901 --> 03:34.862
Lost, strayed, stolen.
Who cares?

03:34.862 --> 03:36.864
We, old buddy, are on.

03:36.864 --> 03:39.992
Jack, I just got off an aeroplane.

03:41.702 --> 03:43.871
- No!
- It's more than a job.

03:43.871 --> 03:47.291
It's an opportunity. We talked
about starting an airline,

03:47.291 --> 03:50.294
small at first, growing,
building it into something.

03:50.294 --> 03:52.213
- Air Dalton.
- Yeah.

03:52.213 --> 03:54.840
It's my dream,
all I ever wanted in the world.

03:54.840 --> 03:56.050
Jack...

03:56.050 --> 04:00.095
I know I pulled you into hassles.
You've bailed me out, I owe you.

04:00.095 --> 04:03.641
Our friendship's worth something.
The Iturbe money is real.

04:03.641 --> 04:06.393
The lady is real. It's legit.

04:08.228 --> 04:11.023
Oh! Oh!

04:11.190 --> 04:13.734
It's her. Oh, come on.

04:13.734 --> 04:17.988
Come with me.
Just one fun trip to...

04:18.154 --> 04:19.990
...Toulon, France.

04:19.990 --> 04:22.576
Excuse me.

04:24.787 --> 04:26.914
- Hello, Ms Iturbe.
- Captain Dalton.

04:26.914 --> 04:29.291
- Come right in.
- Thank you.

04:29.291 --> 04:31.877
You must be MacGyver.

04:31.877 --> 04:34.338
- Elena Iturbe.
- It's a pleasure.

04:34.338 --> 04:37.257
What a charming place you have here,
Captain Dalton.

04:37.257 --> 04:40.636
Glad you like it. We're ready
to leave. I filed flight plans.

04:40.636 --> 04:43.138
- Good.
- Ms Iturbe, about this...

04:43.138 --> 04:45.932
I'm most happy to have you aboard.

04:45.932 --> 04:50.604
Captain Dalton has told me
a great deal about you.

04:52.898 --> 04:55.525
I'm all packed.

05:11.958 --> 05:15.629
- I'll get the plane warmed up.
- Good.

05:20.050 --> 05:23.928
Miss Iturbe, I'm Simon Warwick.
It's a privilege to meet you in person.

05:23.928 --> 05:28.224
Thank you. I imagine you wish
to see my identity.

05:28.224 --> 05:29.684
Hardly necessary.

05:29.684 --> 05:32.353
- Do you have everything prepared?
- Of course.

05:32.353 --> 05:34.856
Your attorneys approved
the sale contract.

05:34.856 --> 05:37.859
It's not their money,
nor their jewels.

05:37.859 --> 05:40.487
May I see them, please?

05:45.700 --> 05:47.160
Yes.

05:47.160 --> 05:49.746
Quite correct.

05:49.871 --> 05:53.541
Designed for a queen.
Fitting, for a princess.

05:53.541 --> 05:56.336
Thank you. Goodbye, Mr Warwick.

05:59.505 --> 06:01.174
Can I help you with that?

06:01.174 --> 06:03.926
The jewels? They're not heavy.

06:03.926 --> 06:05.970
Beautiful, but not heavy.

06:05.970 --> 06:07.889
Did you see them on television?

06:07.889 --> 06:10.975
- Oh, yeah.
- And what did you think?

06:10.975 --> 06:14.729
I think it's kind of a flashy way
of telling people you're rich.

06:14.729 --> 06:17.315
- You don't approve?
- Probably just jealous.

06:17.315 --> 06:20.776
- Ready for immediate takeoff.
- Good.

06:21.986 --> 06:24.614
- Stop!
- Thieves!

06:25.114 --> 06:27.700
Get out of here, Jack!

07:03.777 --> 07:06.405
That's my boy.

07:21.211 --> 07:23.839
Up, up and away.

07:28.802 --> 07:30.512
Oh, you were both marvellous!

07:30.512 --> 07:33.807
I have a radiophone in my cabin.
I'll notify the authorities.

07:33.807 --> 07:37.603
Dalton, MacGyver, thank you.

07:39.938 --> 07:42.524
Air Dalton lives!

07:54.745 --> 07:57.372
Dalton is asleep.

07:57.414 --> 08:00.292
Well, it's my shift.
He might as well.

08:00.292 --> 08:03.420
He trusts you.
And you trust him.

08:03.462 --> 08:07.883
That was obvious from the way you two
worked together to handle those thieves.

08:07.883 --> 08:13.597
Especially in defence of a woman
of whom you don't really approve.

08:13.597 --> 08:17.559
- Now what gave you that idea?
- Oh, you made it quite clear.

08:17.559 --> 08:19.644
And Dalton told me about you.

08:19.644 --> 08:25.609
Apparently, you would rather give
$32 million to medical research.

08:26.359 --> 08:28.320
Yeah.

08:28.320 --> 08:34.993
But then that's probably why you
own the plane, and I'm just flying it.

08:38.746 --> 08:42.458
We'll be landing in a few hours.
What then?

08:42.458 --> 08:44.961
Oh, I shall probably go
into my wine cellar

08:44.961 --> 08:48.756
and choose a bottle of
truly exceptional champagne

08:48.756 --> 08:53.761
and sit on my terrace and
congratulate myself on my acquisition.

08:53.761 --> 08:57.015
What are you going to do
with those jewels?

08:57.015 --> 09:00.101
Wear them, exhibit them,

09:00.268 --> 09:03.104
sell them for a profit,
anything I choose.

09:03.104 --> 09:07.233
You would probably give them
to a campaign for hunger.

09:07.233 --> 09:08.484
Yeah.

09:08.484 --> 09:10.069
And save a few lives?

09:10.069 --> 09:12.989
For what? Six months? A year?

09:13.156 --> 09:17.243
Until they breed more starving children
and the money runs out, then what?

09:17.243 --> 09:20.538
Then you'd have bought another year.

09:20.913 --> 09:23.040
You can do a lot in a year.

09:23.040 --> 09:26.252
As you said, it is my money.

09:29.380 --> 09:32.300
You know, my grandfather used to say,

09:32.300 --> 09:37.638
"If you're afraid of the answer,
don't ask the question."

09:37.888 --> 09:40.599
Notify me when we make
the landing approach.

09:40.599 --> 09:43.227
I've arranged to be met.

09:48.315 --> 09:50.901
Yes, ma'am.

10:01.537 --> 10:03.789
There she is, Toulon, France.

10:03.789 --> 10:08.002
Better ask Miss Iturbe
if she needs any help.

10:09.003 --> 10:12.673
Hi. Thought I'd let you know
we'll be landing in about five minutes.

10:12.673 --> 10:15.009
Good. I've arranged to be met.

10:15.009 --> 10:16.969
I'm anxious to avoid the press,

10:16.969 --> 10:19.972
which will be waiting for me
like a pack of wolves.

10:19.972 --> 10:23.100
- Hello?
- Robert, it's Elena Iturbe here.

10:23.100 --> 10:24.852
We are landing in Toulon now.

10:24.852 --> 10:27.980
Very good. The helicopter
will be there in five minutes.

10:27.980 --> 10:30.607
Merci.

11:07.477 --> 11:10.939
Take the plane to the terminal
and check it in.

11:10.939 --> 11:16.403
Then go to the Metropole Hotel,
and I will contact you there.

11:16.403 --> 11:19.030
Will do.

11:39.217 --> 11:42.387
Here they come.
I anticipate champagne, flashbulbs

11:42.387 --> 11:44.639
and, with any luck,
local beauty queens

11:44.639 --> 11:48.810
panting after my
highly trained pilot's body.

11:56.776 --> 11:58.903
Bonjour! I guess you're expecting us.

11:58.903 --> 12:02.198
Yes, we were.
You are under arrest.

12:20.717 --> 12:22.844
Excuse me, but do you
know who we are?

12:22.844 --> 12:25.596
Yes. Two American thieves.

12:25.763 --> 12:28.224
And I am Inspector Andres.

12:28.224 --> 12:31.018
And where is the woman?

12:31.185 --> 12:33.104
Elena Iturbe?

12:33.104 --> 12:35.147
No, Mr MacGyver.

12:35.147 --> 12:38.150
Miss Iturbe, the real Elena Iturbe,

12:38.150 --> 12:41.862
has been discovered in
her hotel suite, in your country,

12:41.862 --> 12:45.324
bound and gagged,
with her real flight crew,

12:45.324 --> 12:50.204
her passport and papers
stolen by your accomplice.

12:50.997 --> 12:54.125
Where is she?
Where are the jewels?

12:54.125 --> 12:57.294
Hey, wait. Hold it.
Momentito, s'il vous plait.

12:57.294 --> 13:01.173
Miss Iturbe hired us. And if
you're trying to run some hustle...

13:01.173 --> 13:03.676
Jack!

13:03.676 --> 13:06.262
Shush.

13:07.221 --> 13:09.723
Inspector, what Jack means is,

13:09.723 --> 13:14.103
we were under the impression the woman
we were working for was Ms Iturbe.

13:14.103 --> 13:16.689
- You expect me to believe that?
- Yeah.

13:16.689 --> 13:19.441
You used a woman who
resembled Miss Iturbe

13:19.441 --> 13:22.361
to commit a brilliant robbery.
My congratulations.

13:22.361 --> 13:25.990
Look, with all due respect,
maybe if we talked to your superior...

13:25.990 --> 13:29.618
This is my investigation.

13:29.785 --> 13:33.414
When I recover the Lupescu jewels,
I can expect a promotion.

13:33.414 --> 13:38.001
Perhaps a medal. And I have no intention
of sharing this opportunity.

13:38.001 --> 13:43.841
Then as an American citizen,
I demand a call to my embassy.

13:44.007 --> 13:46.593
There are no Americans here.

13:46.593 --> 13:49.638
Only prisoners.

14:08.490 --> 14:10.826
They are truly stunning.

14:10.826 --> 14:14.663
You did a fantastic job, Liane.

14:14.830 --> 14:17.415
Or should I call you Elena?

14:18.667 --> 14:22.796
Thank God that's over.
But it was almost a disaster.

14:22.796 --> 14:25.715
I had to hire a pair of pilots
at one day's notice.

14:25.715 --> 14:29.553
- What do you mean?
- The two you hired didn't show up.

14:29.553 --> 14:33.181
I apologise, Liane.
How did you find replacements?

14:33.181 --> 14:34.975
I used my contacts.

14:34.975 --> 14:39.688
I found Jack Dalton.
He flew the U.S.-Mexican border,

14:39.688 --> 14:42.023
bit of smuggling, but nothing serious.

14:42.023 --> 14:45.193
He had his papers and his passport,
and he was hungry.

14:45.193 --> 14:47.487
Resourceful. And his copilot?

14:47.487 --> 14:50.073
He brought in a friend, MacGyver.

14:50.073 --> 14:52.367
A sort of soldier of fortune, I gather.

14:52.367 --> 14:54.994
- I'll check them out.
- But what about the buyers?

14:54.994 --> 14:58.123
Coming in later today.
Bulging with cash

14:58.123 --> 15:02.877
- and ready to bid.
- How much do you think we'll get?

15:02.877 --> 15:05.463
A lot.

15:05.880 --> 15:10.260
Listen to me.
Would thieves file a flight plan?

15:14.806 --> 15:17.392
Show him in immediately.

15:17.517 --> 15:21.187
You can explain
from the beginning to Mr Brosz,

15:21.187 --> 15:23.064
Miss Iturbe's head of security.

15:23.064 --> 15:25.775
Excellent, all he has to do
is listen to reason.

15:25.775 --> 15:29.821
So these are the men who attacked us
when we tried to retrieve the jewels?

15:29.821 --> 15:32.824
You even eluded Miss Iturbe's
security at the airport.

15:32.824 --> 15:34.867
I see. I see!

15:34.867 --> 15:36.953
No, it was a big misunderstanding.

15:36.953 --> 15:38.538
- We thought...
- Enough!

15:38.538 --> 15:41.958
Take them to the interrogation centre.

15:49.757 --> 15:55.304
Inspector, Miss Iturbe is
a very influential and gracious lady.

15:55.304 --> 15:58.265
She's only interested
in recovering the jewels.

15:58.265 --> 16:03.229
Not in any methods you
may find it necessary to take.

16:04.480 --> 16:08.442
- Do we understand each other?
- Completely.

16:11.654 --> 16:13.781
- 'Morning, Helen.
- 'Morning.

16:13.781 --> 16:17.034
- Has MacGyver called in yet?
- Not since I've been in.

16:17.034 --> 16:19.954
But there's a message
blinking on your private line.

16:19.954 --> 16:23.165
And no, I didn't listen in.

16:23.332 --> 16:25.960
Thanks a lot.

16:29.755 --> 16:30.965
Hi, Pete.

16:30.965 --> 16:34.093
I'm calling early, but I wanted
to make sure you got this.

16:34.093 --> 16:37.763
So do me a favour, will you?
Sit down.

16:42.226 --> 16:44.561
Thanks.

16:44.561 --> 16:47.064
Pete, something came up,
and I...

16:47.064 --> 16:49.191
Well, I sort of took off, with Jack.

16:49.191 --> 16:51.610
Dalton?!

16:51.610 --> 16:55.197
Pete? Sit down.
This is completely legitimate.

16:55.197 --> 16:56.823
He is nothing but trouble.

16:56.823 --> 17:00.535
I know, he is nothing but trouble,
but this is really important to him.

17:00.535 --> 17:02.704
We've hired on to ferry Ms Elena Iturbe

17:02.704 --> 17:05.123
back to Toulon, France,
in her private jet.

17:05.123 --> 17:07.876
Jack needed a copilot,
and I was kind of elected.

17:07.876 --> 17:10.753
I didn't figure you'd miss me.
I'll be back tomorrow.

17:10.753 --> 17:12.297
- What?!
- So don't worry.

17:12.297 --> 17:16.259
And it's a real big shot for Jack.
This is his big chance.

17:16.259 --> 17:20.555
- After, Dalton Airlines will take off.
- What are you involved in?

17:20.555 --> 17:23.934
Don't get all shook up.
Just relax.

17:25.185 --> 17:27.771
Dalton.

17:27.896 --> 17:29.815
Dalton!

17:29.815 --> 17:32.234
Helen!

17:32.234 --> 17:33.443
Yes, sir?

17:33.443 --> 17:36.738
Get me on the first
available flight for T oulon, France.

17:36.738 --> 17:39.366
Yes, sir.

17:40.325 --> 17:42.953
Dalton!

17:49.876 --> 17:53.213
She looked the part.
She had Elena Iturbe's passport.

17:53.213 --> 17:55.715
- Why wouldn't we believe her?
- Be quiet.

17:55.715 --> 17:58.051
Stupidity irritates me.

17:58.051 --> 18:02.096
I have three dozen men out
searching for your female accomplice.

18:02.096 --> 18:04.349
But I'm not going to waste the time.

18:04.349 --> 18:07.393
You are going to lead me to her.

18:07.519 --> 18:09.771
Do you know what this is?

18:09.771 --> 18:12.607
Sure, that's electrical shock torture.

18:12.607 --> 18:15.735
Put a bunch of voltage
through a human body.

18:15.735 --> 18:17.528
It's usually against the law.

18:17.528 --> 18:19.864
It is also very painful.

18:19.864 --> 18:21.574
You burn internally.

18:21.574 --> 18:24.410
Sometimes bones
break in convulsions.

18:24.410 --> 18:27.413
- Not pleasant.
- No, you can't!

18:27.580 --> 18:29.791
I mean, it's crazy!
Torture's illegal.

18:29.791 --> 18:32.919
I can't stand pain.
What do you want me to say?

18:32.919 --> 18:38.633
- The truth is, he conned me into it!
- You gutless, whining little wimp!

18:38.633 --> 18:41.260
Right now!

18:43.638 --> 18:46.432
- Care to dance?
- No, thanks.

19:25.304 --> 19:27.890
Taxi!

19:39.735 --> 19:41.945
So how do we
get out of this country?

19:41.945 --> 19:43.739
We don't.

19:43.739 --> 19:46.492
We're crooks until
we square with the police,

19:46.492 --> 19:49.161
which means
we should get a line on those jewels.

19:49.161 --> 19:51.705
MacGyver, we're wanted criminals,

19:51.705 --> 19:54.833
we broke out of a torture chamber
by slugging an inspector

19:54.833 --> 19:58.212
and the head of security for the
richest woman in the universe.

19:58.212 --> 20:02.716
We got no choice.
Either we're innocent, or we're dead.

20:02.716 --> 20:04.092
There's a third way.

20:04.092 --> 20:07.304
This place has to be full
of folks who don't like les cops.

20:07.304 --> 20:09.348
Maybe we could hire some help.

20:09.348 --> 20:12.392
What, local crooks?
And stay on the wanted list?

20:12.392 --> 20:15.854
- Forget it.
- We don't know the territory.

20:15.854 --> 20:19.524
We don't know this con woman's
real name. We don't know where she...

20:19.524 --> 20:22.819
What? Your light just went on. Give.

20:22.944 --> 20:25.781
The police already eliminated
a lot of territory,

20:25.781 --> 20:27.574
and we know things they don't.

20:27.574 --> 20:31.244
Like she took off in a chopper
and is probably in Sweden or Africa?

20:31.244 --> 20:33.371
It's not likely.

20:33.371 --> 20:37.709
That chopper took off and reached us at
the runway here in exactly five minutes.

20:37.709 --> 20:43.048
Figure air speed of 1 20 miles per,
it came a little less than ten miles...

20:43.048 --> 20:47.093
...which means it took off from...
along this line.

20:47.093 --> 20:50.680
OK, it's not Sweden,
but it's still a lot of territory.

20:50.680 --> 20:53.558
Yeah. But we know it came in
south by southwest,

20:53.558 --> 20:56.644
so we trace back
north by northeast...

20:56.644 --> 20:59.230
...intersects... here.

20:59.773 --> 21:02.817
There's a church and a winery.

21:03.777 --> 21:06.362
Oh, I shall probably go
into my wine cellar

21:06.362 --> 21:10.617
and choose a bottle of
truly exceptional champagne...

21:10.617 --> 21:13.870
Winery. Winery.

21:14.037 --> 21:15.496
What is it?

21:15.496 --> 21:18.750
"I'll go to the cellars and
choose a fine bottle of champagne

21:18.750 --> 21:21.336
and congratulate myself."

21:22.795 --> 21:25.423
She's got to be here.

21:38.269 --> 21:41.189
Looks like at least
two armed guards on duty.

21:41.189 --> 21:45.818
OK, so I guess knocking
on the front door is out.

21:47.445 --> 21:50.031
Let's try this way.

22:26.025 --> 22:28.569
- Take a look.
- Alarm system?

22:28.569 --> 22:30.571
There might be more.

22:30.571 --> 22:35.910
This guy's kind of nervous
for a lousy 32 mil in hot ice.

22:35.910 --> 22:39.705
Let's go one at a time,
and be careful.

23:04.062 --> 23:06.398
Oh, no! No, rabbit.

23:06.398 --> 23:09.943
Stay, stay, wait!
Oh, stop. Stay.

23:22.748 --> 23:25.375
No, back! Get back!

23:26.877 --> 23:29.463
Stay.

23:33.508 --> 23:36.136
No, you...!

23:39.681 --> 23:42.309
Stop right there!

24:03.621 --> 24:06.291
MacGyver, I presume.
Search for the other one.

24:06.291 --> 24:08.835
- Dalton.
- Who, Jack?

24:08.835 --> 24:12.422
Jack's long gone.
He's gone for help.

24:15.175 --> 24:17.468
We'll see about that.

24:17.468 --> 24:20.763
- Come. Get him inside.
- Let's go.

24:20.805 --> 24:23.433
Let's go.

24:44.746 --> 24:47.373
You owe me one.

25:11.939 --> 25:14.734
Mr Russell, welcome.

25:14.900 --> 25:17.611
This is my associate,
Liane Auber.

25:17.611 --> 25:20.740
Pleasure. Your deception
was very clever.

25:20.740 --> 25:25.369
- Thank you.
- Would you care to step inside, sir?

25:30.875 --> 25:34.211
Look, inspector, I came here
because I know MacGyver.

25:34.211 --> 25:36.964
I'm a friend of his.
And he's no thief.

25:36.964 --> 25:38.591
Somehow he's been framed.

25:38.591 --> 25:41.719
The evidence is
overwhelming, Mr Thornton.

25:41.719 --> 25:44.972
Besides, we are not certain
of either criminal's identity.

25:44.972 --> 25:46.348
They had no passports.

25:46.348 --> 25:49.935
The descriptions you have
match MacGyver and Dalton perfectly.

25:49.935 --> 25:52.688
They're criminals, Mr Thornton.

25:52.688 --> 25:55.607
My advice is that you
return to the United States.

25:55.607 --> 25:58.110
Not until I see them...
with a lawyer.

25:58.110 --> 26:02.114
When we capture these criminals,
we shall have to establish identities.

26:02.114 --> 26:06.785
Question them. It might be months before
they are allowed to see an attorney.

26:06.785 --> 26:08.662
We'll see about that.

26:08.662 --> 26:11.290
Mr Thornton.

26:11.415 --> 26:15.919
Look, I know who you are, but this is
a criminal case in my jurisdiction.

26:15.919 --> 26:18.839
Any interference,
political or otherwise,

26:18.839 --> 26:21.174
and I'll have you
deported immediately.

26:21.174 --> 26:24.511
- Is that clear?
- Oh, yes. Very.

26:25.012 --> 26:27.639
Thank you for your courtesy.

26:29.975 --> 26:32.060
MacGyver!

26:32.060 --> 26:34.730
How did he find us?
And where is Dalton?

26:34.730 --> 26:38.400
- Two excellent questions.
- He knows.

26:38.567 --> 26:42.446
I think we shall cut some answers
out of our Mr MacGyver.

26:42.446 --> 26:44.322
What are you talking about?

26:44.322 --> 26:47.159
Torture. He's talking about torture.

26:47.159 --> 26:50.287
No. We had an agreement.

26:50.453 --> 26:53.290
The Iturbe woman loses money
she can afford to.

26:53.290 --> 26:56.042
But nobody gets hurt,
and nobody gets killed.

26:56.042 --> 26:57.711
- I like that.
- Quiet.

26:57.711 --> 27:00.922
Or what? You'll blow his head off?

27:00.922 --> 27:03.800
No. Let me make myself
absolutely clear.

27:03.800 --> 27:06.678
There is to be no killing.
I will not stand for it.

27:06.678 --> 27:08.221
You won't?

27:08.221 --> 27:10.557
So we just pack up and leave?

27:10.557 --> 27:14.144
No, Liane. I'm content here.

27:14.310 --> 27:18.231
I'm a respectable landowner,
with a staff that's loyal.

27:18.231 --> 27:21.609
I only have two small areas of risk.

27:22.110 --> 27:25.613
Our Mr MacGyver here
and now you.

27:25.780 --> 27:27.323
I'm your partner.

27:27.323 --> 27:30.743
I think I just bought you out.

27:37.333 --> 27:40.878
- Nothing else to say?
- Would talking be of any use?

27:40.878 --> 27:43.464
No.

27:44.882 --> 27:49.095
When my auction is over,
we will finish this.

27:54.684 --> 27:57.395
Goodbye... Liane.

28:07.405 --> 28:09.865
Position René
at the top of the stairs.

28:09.865 --> 28:11.742
I want no one to come down here.

28:11.742 --> 28:14.328
Immediately, Monsieur Donnay.

28:19.625 --> 28:22.253
All right, I was stupid.

28:22.378 --> 28:26.173
For coming to my rescue?
I kind of appreciate that, actually.

28:26.173 --> 28:28.759
Nevertheless, stupid.

28:29.176 --> 28:30.719
Look, we're not dead.

28:30.719 --> 28:34.098
We've got time to figure a way
out of here, and Jack will be back.

28:34.098 --> 28:38.894
Oh, Dalton? He's an ex-smuggler
with the ethics of a weasel.

28:38.894 --> 28:41.814
Yeah. But he's still my friend.

28:44.108 --> 28:47.486
Donnay called you Liane, is it?

28:47.653 --> 28:50.281
Liane Auber.

28:50.698 --> 28:52.616
I believe in honesty...

28:52.616 --> 28:55.452
...at least when I'm
contemplating my own death.

28:55.452 --> 28:57.746
Look, we're gonna get out of here.

28:57.746 --> 29:01.583
Oh. With some help from
your friend Jack? I doubt it.

29:01.583 --> 29:04.461
You know, I suppose
I can understand that.

29:04.461 --> 29:06.839
Your friend plans to kill you.

29:06.839 --> 29:09.466
My friend plans to save me.

29:16.932 --> 29:19.309
Look, I'll tell you
what I'm gonna do.

29:19.309 --> 29:21.186
I'll write you a personal cheque.

29:21.186 --> 29:23.897
Drawn on an American bank.
It's better than cash.

29:23.897 --> 29:27.985
All yours, for one job. Help a friend
of mine out of a minor misunderstanding.

29:27.985 --> 29:29.987
- No.
- All right, I'll tell you what.

29:29.987 --> 29:32.864
I'll throw in a cash bonus.
After the job.

29:32.864 --> 29:37.494
- Why don't we do it?
- Are you crazy? Let's go.

29:41.832 --> 29:43.583
Hey!

29:43.583 --> 29:46.211
Mon ami. My friend.

29:46.378 --> 29:49.548
- Can I talk to you?
- Sure.

30:09.609 --> 30:12.278
Mr Brizard. Welcome.

30:12.737 --> 30:15.532
- Thank you.
- Do come inside.

30:25.166 --> 30:28.753
MacGyver... what are you doing?

30:46.938 --> 30:52.443
If I can get my hands wet,
maybe I can wiggle out of this.

31:18.928 --> 31:22.014
- Thank you.
- Welcome. Let's go.

31:24.475 --> 31:28.646
- But we are still prisoners. Locked in.
- We better work on that.

31:28.646 --> 31:32.900
There is a man with a gun
guarding that door.

31:33.275 --> 31:37.446
Maybe we should consider
a different way out.

31:37.863 --> 31:39.365
That door is steel.

31:39.365 --> 31:42.827
It is cross-braced
and double locked.

31:42.993 --> 31:46.205
I never said it was gonna be easy.

32:07.935 --> 32:10.562
Could you help me?

32:23.867 --> 32:26.662
3,500, 4,000,

32:26.828 --> 32:29.414
4,500, 5,000, right?

32:29.581 --> 32:32.167
- Anytime.
- You!

32:35.587 --> 32:38.840
- You had me slugged!
- No, as a matter of fact, I didn't.

32:38.840 --> 32:40.759
But it's not a bad thought.

32:40.759 --> 32:44.304
What I did was put out
a reward to have you brought in.

32:44.304 --> 32:46.890
Oh, I'm touched.

32:46.890 --> 32:49.518
Matter of fact, I'm bruised.

32:50.018 --> 32:54.022
Don't tell me. You're a secret
Mediterranean crime boss.

32:54.022 --> 32:57.484
No, what I am is a guy with
a few connections in this area.

32:57.484 --> 33:00.070
I used to run a DXS operation here.

33:00.070 --> 33:02.739
And you know what you are? Trouble.

33:02.739 --> 33:04.324
Now, where is MacGyver?

33:04.324 --> 33:06.952
Well...

33:08.245 --> 33:11.498
...actually, he's...
he's being held prisoner.

33:11.498 --> 33:13.792
Prisoner? Prisoner?!

33:13.792 --> 33:16.378
I knew it. I knew it!

33:17.796 --> 33:21.674
Jack, having you as a friend is
a little bit like owning a pet disease.

33:21.674 --> 33:23.843
Are you trying to hint you're upset?

33:23.843 --> 33:27.931
Upset? Why would I be upset?
Because you've done it again?

33:27.931 --> 33:32.018
One more time, you have conned him
into bailing you out of something.

33:32.018 --> 33:34.103
Now he's the one that was deep-sixed.

33:34.103 --> 33:35.939
Probably in a bed of quicksand.

33:35.939 --> 33:39.317
Actually, it's a winery.
He's there with the Lupescu jewels.

33:39.317 --> 33:41.611
A place called the Domaine Donnay.

33:41.611 --> 33:45.114
- I know the place.
- Domaine Donnay?

33:45.281 --> 33:48.076
All right. Now we're getting someplace.

33:48.076 --> 33:50.495
We learned the diamonds
were up for sale,

33:50.495 --> 33:54.123
and three heavyweight buyers
are coming into Toulon to bid on them.

33:54.123 --> 33:57.168
We couldn't find out where
it was gonna take place.

33:57.168 --> 34:00.171
- All you had to do was ask.
- It makes for logic, Peter.

34:00.171 --> 34:03.758
The buyers cross the border
legitimately, as wine merchants.

34:03.758 --> 34:07.678
- Can you find them?
- It might be difficult.

34:07.678 --> 34:09.806
- Money's no object.
- Jack!

34:09.806 --> 34:13.266
In that case, two of them have
already checked out of their hotels.

34:13.266 --> 34:14.726
You didn't tell me that.

34:14.726 --> 34:18.856
You didn't mention
that money was no object.

34:20.565 --> 34:23.735
The third buyer is one
August Bauman, from Munich,

34:23.735 --> 34:27.822
staying at the
Hotel Toulonaise, suite 31 7.

34:36.998 --> 34:41.170
- Who is it?
- Assistant manager, Herr Bauman.

34:43.880 --> 34:47.051
A case of wine has arrived
for you, from Monsieur Donnay.

34:47.051 --> 34:49.637
Oh?

34:50.094 --> 34:52.931
You must be a very close friend.

34:52.931 --> 34:55.309
Actually, I have never met him.

34:55.309 --> 34:57.895
But we are to do business together.

34:57.895 --> 35:01.649
- Champagne.
- Only the best for you.

35:11.367 --> 35:13.994
Here it is.

35:14.578 --> 35:16.789
"Herr August Bauman."

35:16.789 --> 35:20.584
Oh, boy. He's due at Domaine Donnay
in less than an hour.

35:20.584 --> 35:23.420
- We can get there in 20 minutes.
- Yeah, and do what?

35:23.420 --> 35:25.756
Well, bust in, find Mac, you know.

35:25.756 --> 35:27.883
How many guards were there?

35:27.883 --> 35:29.635
I saw... five.

35:29.635 --> 35:31.887
Yeah, five. Figure more.

35:31.887 --> 35:34.598
No, we can't break in.
We've got to get in somehow.

35:34.598 --> 35:35.974
We've got to sneak in.

35:35.974 --> 35:39.728
Disguised as what?
Mother Theresa and a leper?

35:39.728 --> 35:42.481
- Sorry.
- No.

35:44.107 --> 35:46.026
I go in.

35:46.026 --> 35:49.654
As Herr August Bauman.
The third buyer.

35:49.780 --> 35:52.741
Great thought. Except I'm
the one that has to do it.

35:52.741 --> 35:55.744
This needs style, finesse.
A certain, je ne sais quoi.

35:55.744 --> 36:00.373
It needs someone the girl hasn't seen,
hasn't described and can't recognise.

36:00.373 --> 36:02.834
And someone the police
won't shoot on sight.

36:02.834 --> 36:06.129
Yeah, but... You're right.

36:06.296 --> 36:08.965
I'm going as the chauffeur.
What's the plan?

36:08.965 --> 36:11.301
All right.

36:11.301 --> 36:13.511
I play Bauman.

36:13.511 --> 36:16.222
I get us past their security.

36:17.474 --> 36:19.934
Oh, my God.

36:19.934 --> 36:22.604
I'm gonna have to trust you.

36:27.650 --> 36:32.739
I'll keep the bidding going as long as I
can. You find MacGyver and get him out.

36:32.739 --> 36:35.325
Gotcha.

36:48.338 --> 36:51.049
Herr Donnay? Bauman.

36:52.592 --> 36:57.597
- Shall we get down to business?
- Certainly. This way.

37:08.024 --> 37:11.652
Gentlemen...
Herr August Bauman.

37:11.819 --> 37:14.572
- You're late.
- I don't know you.

37:14.572 --> 37:18.367
This is Mr David Russell,
Mr Jacques Brizard.

37:18.367 --> 37:20.995
How very interesting.

37:20.995 --> 37:23.873
I prefer that we
waste no more time.

37:23.873 --> 37:26.792
- So?
- Very well.

37:26.959 --> 37:29.545
Gentlemen, this way.

37:29.629 --> 37:33.591
Johann... you will remain here.

37:54.028 --> 37:56.614
Are you certain this will work?

37:56.614 --> 37:58.157
Nope.

37:58.157 --> 38:00.618
But when you release
gas under pressure,

38:00.618 --> 38:03.454
you're using one
of the basic laws of physics.

38:03.454 --> 38:06.624
For every action there's an equal
and opposite reaction.

38:06.624 --> 38:10.628
But what about this thing?
It must weigh, what, 1,000 kilograms?

38:10.628 --> 38:12.504
Yeah, you're right.

38:12.504 --> 38:17.718
Haul over another nitrogen cylinder.
We need all the reaction we can get.

38:17.718 --> 38:19.762
But what is the point of all this?

38:19.762 --> 38:23.640
- There are four armed men outside.
- It may be no point at all.

38:23.640 --> 38:27.895
But if Jack's coming at them from
outside, I want things equal inside.

38:27.895 --> 38:31.982
- You really think he will come?
- Oh, yeah.

38:32.316 --> 38:34.943
Yeah.

38:36.820 --> 38:39.865
Straight ahead, if you will,
for our little auction.

38:39.865 --> 38:41.450
Here?

38:41.450 --> 38:45.287
Twelve-inch-thick
stone walls. One door.

38:45.454 --> 38:48.081
No security risks, gentlemen.

38:48.957 --> 38:51.918
To protect... these.

38:54.212 --> 38:57.132
The terms... cash.

38:57.299 --> 38:59.885
They are truly beautiful.

39:00.510 --> 39:03.764
- Delivery guaranteed.
- How?

39:03.930 --> 39:07.642
You will receive a shipment of wine,
through normal legal channels.

39:07.642 --> 39:11.062
Concealed inside... the jewels.

39:11.229 --> 39:14.649
- Undetectable.
- Very efficient. Good.

39:14.649 --> 39:18.612
One last point.
The bidding, U.S. dollars.

39:18.778 --> 39:21.406
Commencing, ten million.

39:22.574 --> 39:27.787
Robert, see to it that
Herr Bauman's man is comfortable.

39:33.376 --> 39:36.004
Gentlemen.

39:59.777 --> 40:03.489
Monsieur... what are you doing?

40:04.324 --> 40:08.244
I have $25 million in cash.

40:08.411 --> 40:10.329
Makes me nervous.

40:10.329 --> 40:13.875
- Twenty-five million dollars?
- Yeah.

40:15.376 --> 40:16.878
Don't worry.

40:16.878 --> 40:19.464
We have complete security.

40:19.464 --> 40:22.884
An alarm system
and armed men on patrol.

40:22.884 --> 40:25.011
Security?

40:25.011 --> 40:28.306
Your boss told my boss
that you had a break-in earlier today.

40:28.306 --> 40:29.932
We caught him.

40:29.932 --> 40:32.560
He's under guard in the wine cellar.

40:32.560 --> 40:35.813
In the wine cellar?
Down there?

40:37.982 --> 40:40.526
Good, that makes me feel better.

40:40.526 --> 40:44.030
Have you ever seen
$25 million in cash?

40:44.030 --> 40:46.657
Never. Show me.

40:57.793 --> 41:02.006
- Twelve million dollars.
- Twelve million five.

41:02.006 --> 41:04.717
- Thirteen.
- Fifteen million.

41:05.217 --> 41:06.802
- Seventeen.
- Ridiculous.

41:06.802 --> 41:08.804
Oh? Then they are mine?

41:08.804 --> 41:11.015
No.

41:11.015 --> 41:13.601
Eighteen million.

41:14.852 --> 41:17.438
I'm out of it.

41:23.986 --> 41:28.157
- Twenty million.
- Gentlemen... take your time.

41:28.157 --> 41:30.451
Think about Herr Bauman's bid.

41:30.451 --> 41:32.661
Oh, yes.

41:32.661 --> 41:35.289
Take all the time you like.

41:41.420 --> 41:44.047
Wake up!

42:10.907 --> 42:16.454
All right, we have to knock off
these valves, simultaneously.

42:16.621 --> 42:19.207
Come on.

42:34.014 --> 42:36.224
I should have knocked.

42:36.224 --> 42:38.893
Jack, I'm glad it's you.

42:39.060 --> 42:43.940
MacGyver! And the ever-lovely
Elena Iturbe or whatever.

42:43.940 --> 42:46.985
- Oh, it's nice to see you again.
- She's with us, Jack.

42:46.985 --> 42:51.656
She's agreed to testify against Donnay.
Let's move before somebody checks on us.

42:51.656 --> 42:55.159
Never fear. Pete's with Donnay
at this moment, buying us time.

42:55.159 --> 42:57.537
- Pete?
- He heard we got our tails in a crack,

42:57.537 --> 43:00.164
he came running.
He's one of the auction buyers.

43:00.164 --> 43:02.458
I was supposed to find you.
Which I did...

43:02.458 --> 43:06.546
-...brilliantly.
- In God's name, can we go?

43:17.765 --> 43:20.768
- Where'd he go?
- To tell Donnay Pete's an impostor.

43:20.768 --> 43:22.937
Let's use this thing
to get out of here.

43:22.937 --> 43:25.857
- And leave Pete here?
- No way. Where's this auction?

43:25.857 --> 43:30.862
In the wine-tasting room,
the other side of that wall.

43:30.862 --> 43:33.489
Give me a hand.

43:35.074 --> 43:37.076
Easy.

43:37.076 --> 43:39.704
Twenty-two million,
five hundred thousand.

43:39.704 --> 43:42.790
This is insane. I'm finished.

43:44.292 --> 43:48.337
Going... going... gone.

43:48.504 --> 43:52.049
He's not Bauman. He's a fake.
He came with the other one, Dalton.

43:52.049 --> 43:54.885
Relax, gentlemen. Dalton?

43:55.052 --> 43:57.596
I locked him in with
MacGyver and the girl.

43:57.596 --> 43:59.640
They're not going anywhere.

43:59.640 --> 44:03.144
Well... I guess this means you're
not gonna sell me the jewels.

44:03.144 --> 44:06.480
- So...
- Very amusing.

44:06.647 --> 44:08.524
I don't think so.

44:08.524 --> 44:11.068
Kill him now,
let's get on with business.

44:11.068 --> 44:14.446
- Yes.
- I agree.

44:14.613 --> 44:18.492
Goodbye, Mr Bauman.

44:33.799 --> 44:36.385
You know, gentlemen...

44:36.510 --> 44:40.597
...I don't think you
really want to do this.

44:40.597 --> 44:44.268
Especially not...
in front of witnesses.

44:47.688 --> 44:51.149
But, sir, we are all accomplices here.

44:51.400 --> 44:55.821
Yeah, I hadn't actually
thought of it that way.

44:56.697 --> 45:01.118
Well, certainly going to make
a mess of the jewels, aren't we?

45:01.118 --> 45:03.704
Yes.

45:03.870 --> 45:05.497
We wouldn't want your blood

45:05.497 --> 45:09.292
splattered all over
the jewels, would we?

45:13.839 --> 45:16.049
- That's it.
- I hope this will work.

45:16.049 --> 45:18.552
Yeah, me too. Stand back.

45:18.552 --> 45:20.428
On three.

45:20.428 --> 45:22.430
One... two...

45:22.430 --> 45:25.016
...three!

45:30.397 --> 45:33.024
Go! Go!

45:34.067 --> 45:36.695
Now, Robert.

45:38.238 --> 45:40.865
Let's go!

45:53.670 --> 45:56.297
Stop!

46:02.178 --> 46:06.224
- Sorry to bust in on you like this.
- What kept you?

46:06.224 --> 46:08.810
Hey, are we great or what?
What a team.

46:08.810 --> 46:11.813
Since we're here,
I heard about this sunken treasure.

46:11.813 --> 46:13.940
Fifty million dollars in Nazi gold.

46:13.940 --> 46:16.526
The ship was torpedoed,
and the gold was lost.

46:16.526 --> 46:22.532
All we got to do is get a diving bell
and three bathing suits...
