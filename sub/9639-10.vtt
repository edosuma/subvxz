WEBVTT

00:05.740 --> 00:08.330
Hey, how was school?

00:09.410 --> 00:12.350
Max, why are you carrying
Alex's backpack like that?

00:12.480 --> 00:14.740
She told me my backpack
was bending my spine,

00:14.880 --> 00:16.750
so she gave me hers to even it out.

00:19.150 --> 00:20.980
Let's check.

00:21.490 --> 00:23.580
There, all straight. You're welcome.

00:24.460 --> 00:26.650
Alex, your brother is not your pack mule.

00:26.790 --> 00:28.690
Yeah, l'm not your pack mule.

00:29.460 --> 00:31.060
l'm sorry, Maxy.

00:31.200 --> 00:33.000
- Could you take this upstairs for me?
- Sure.

00:35.540 --> 00:38.440
- Best day at school ever.
- Oh? They found the guy

00:38.570 --> 00:41.130
that was putting peanut butter
in your locker?

00:41.710 --> 00:45.010
No, but this made me forget about that.
Okay, so l'm in biology, right,

00:45.150 --> 00:46.980
when Mr. Medina
has us pick lab partners,

00:47.120 --> 00:50.880
and like always, my partner ends up
being the frog l'm dissecting.

00:51.950 --> 00:53.080
l have the opposite problem.

00:53.220 --> 00:55.420
Everybody wants me
to be their lab partner.

00:55.560 --> 00:59.790
- You don't take biology.
- That's what l keep telling those guys.

00:59.930 --> 01:01.900
Anyway, in walks this brand-new girl,

01:02.030 --> 01:04.660
and she is the hottest thing
l've ever seen in my life.

01:04.800 --> 01:07.290
Eva Longoria goes to your school?

01:09.400 --> 01:11.960
Eva Longoria?

01:12.640 --> 01:15.970
Kids love Eva Longoria. lt's...

01:16.640 --> 01:18.370
Continue, son.

01:18.510 --> 01:23.580
So Mr. Medina assigns the beautiful
Miranda Hampson to be my lab partner.

01:23.720 --> 01:26.810
Miranda Hampson? lsn't she
that new goth girl in 1 1th grade?

01:26.950 --> 01:30.190
She's not goth, she just likes wearing
black and dark makeup

01:30.320 --> 01:33.190
and listens to bands
that are kind of scary.

01:33.960 --> 01:37.260
Oh, so not goth, but goth.

01:38.000 --> 01:40.260
You're missing my point.
l'm in the 10th grade.

01:40.400 --> 01:44.270
- She's an older woman.
- Attaboy, like your mother.

01:46.470 --> 01:48.200
The hot part.

01:48.340 --> 01:51.140
Hold on, now. The story gets even better.
So me and my Miran--

01:51.280 --> 01:53.680
That's my cute nickname for her actually.
Yeah, Miran.

01:55.080 --> 01:58.020
--accidentally reach for the scalpel
at the same time and our hands touch,

01:58.150 --> 02:01.550
and she didn't pull away
for three seconds.

02:02.720 --> 02:04.090
How's that for a great day?

02:06.230 --> 02:08.699
Look, Miranda's here.
l guess your great day's still going on.

02:08.830 --> 02:12.100
Or coming to a tragic end.
Let's watch, boys and girls.

02:12.830 --> 02:15.460
- Hey, Miran.
- Who's Miran?

02:16.200 --> 02:17.690
You, remember?

02:18.940 --> 02:20.130
l called you that in the lab.

02:20.270 --> 02:24.970
Oh, right. l thought you were swallowing
and talking at the same time.

02:26.510 --> 02:29.510
He does generate a lot of saliva.

02:32.550 --> 02:35.040
l have overactive glands.
We're looking into it.

02:35.190 --> 02:39.180
lt was worse when he was a baby.
We had to wrap his head in a diaper.

02:40.630 --> 02:43.120
Excuse me one second. All right...

02:46.370 --> 02:49.130
- Do you need to copy my biology notes?
- Oh, no, no.

02:49.270 --> 02:51.740
l just-- l came to ask you something.

02:51.870 --> 02:53.240
Are you going to the junior prom?

02:53.370 --> 02:56.570
No, l already told them
l don't wanna work lights this year.

02:57.650 --> 02:59.270
Oh, you are so funny.

02:59.810 --> 03:03.270
No, l mean,
would you like to go to the prom with me?

03:03.420 --> 03:05.750
l'm new at the school
and l don't know a lot of guys,

03:05.890 --> 03:07.650
and you seem very nice.

03:07.790 --> 03:09.520
Me?

03:10.090 --> 03:13.580
Well, you know,
l'll have to check the schedule and--

03:13.730 --> 03:14.890
Are you trying to be cool?

03:15.030 --> 03:16.720
- Yeah.
- Don't do that.

03:16.860 --> 03:19.230
- Okay.
- l'm really tired of cool guys.

03:19.630 --> 03:22.030
Don't worry, because l am so not cool.

03:24.000 --> 03:30.074

04:19.390 --> 04:24.130
With the murrieta animata spell,
you can make any object come alive.

04:24.270 --> 04:27.330
Max, you're up.
See what you can do with that cup.

04:27.470 --> 04:30.600
Murrieta animata

04:31.810 --> 04:34.330
Are you picturing it with arms and legs?

04:34.480 --> 04:35.530
No.

04:35.680 --> 04:38.700
You got cheese on the board,
so l'm thinking about cheese.

04:38.850 --> 04:42.650
No, we don't have any cheese.
We have a cup.

04:42.780 --> 04:44.720
Justin, you're up.

04:44.850 --> 04:46.650
Justin. Justin.

04:47.260 --> 04:49.420
What? What?

04:50.990 --> 04:52.720
- Sorry, Dad.
- You're not paying attention.

04:52.860 --> 04:54.590
- That isn't like you.
- Yeah, it's like me.

04:54.730 --> 04:57.060
And you're not even doing it right.
l completely check out.

04:57.200 --> 05:00.030
This place could be burning
and l wouldn't even know it.

05:00.170 --> 05:03.330
- What's up, Justin?
- lt's Miranda. lt's the junior prom.

05:03.470 --> 05:06.200
There's gonna be dancing
and a lot of time to talk,

05:06.340 --> 05:07.400
and l'm kind of nervous.

05:07.540 --> 05:10.240
Well, l'm kind of nervous
no one is paying attention to the lesson.

05:11.080 --> 05:12.600
l am. lt's easy.

05:12.750 --> 05:15.410
All right.
Well, put your magic where your mouth is.

05:16.350 --> 05:18.680
Murrieta animata

05:21.620 --> 05:22.850
Alex, what did you just do?

05:22.990 --> 05:25.460
l did the spell you wanted.
You're welcome.

05:25.590 --> 05:28.760
- Hello, losers.
- We're supposed to be doing it on the cup.

05:28.900 --> 05:31.890
Well, the trophy seemed easier.
lt already has legs.

05:32.200 --> 05:34.220
See you at the finish line.

05:45.510 --> 05:48.350
- Sorry, Dad.
- Sorry nothing.

05:48.480 --> 05:51.650
That was my first place in state trophy
l got in high school.

05:51.790 --> 05:54.880
You'd better find that, young lady,
before your mom sees it.

05:55.020 --> 05:57.320
You know how she hates magic
running amok.

05:57.460 --> 06:01.830
Plus she's still mad about all that stuff
you said about Eva Longoria.

06:01.960 --> 06:04.360
Yeah, Mom was pretty upset
about all that stuff.

06:04.500 --> 06:07.830
Let's relive it. We'll play parts.
l call Mom.

06:07.970 --> 06:09.900
Stop trying to change the subject.

06:10.040 --> 06:11.660
The rest of the lesson
was gonna be about

06:11.810 --> 06:13.600
how we un-animate stuff
we've animated,

06:13.740 --> 06:16.110
and now we can't do that
until you find that trophy.

06:16.610 --> 06:18.600
Class is over.

06:20.010 --> 06:21.640
Great,
l'm already nervous about Miranda,

06:21.780 --> 06:23.910
now l gotta worry
about finding this stupid trophy.

06:24.490 --> 06:26.320
Sounds like you got a lot on your plate.

06:26.450 --> 06:28.150
Let me know
how that all works out for you.

06:36.560 --> 06:38.000
Guys, which is better for prom?

06:39.470 --> 06:42.530
Well, the tux says safe boy,
but the zebra jacket says:

06:42.670 --> 06:44.970
''Danger, danger,
stay away from my daughter.''

06:45.110 --> 06:46.800
Goth girl will like you for that.

06:48.710 --> 06:49.770
Nice one.

06:51.780 --> 06:54.340
You guys can never agree on anything.

06:54.480 --> 06:58.580
Yeah, l think we pretty much agree
on that's the biggest zit we've ever seen.

06:59.990 --> 07:01.150
What zit?

07:07.160 --> 07:10.030
Okay. Well, it can't be that big, can it?

07:10.160 --> 07:13.760
Yeah, maybe the mirror
is like a carnival mirror.

07:14.770 --> 07:16.760
You can hardly see it.

07:16.900 --> 07:20.340
My baby has a zit como una montaña.

07:20.470 --> 07:23.070
That means ''like a mountain.''

07:24.250 --> 07:25.710
This is gonna ruin everything.

07:25.850 --> 07:28.080
l can't take Miranda
to the prom looking like this.

07:28.220 --> 07:29.480
Why not? She does like danger.

07:29.620 --> 07:32.480
lf you go with that thing,
she'll never know when it's gonna blow.

07:37.630 --> 07:39.990
What was l thinking
getting involved with an older woman?

07:40.130 --> 07:42.190
Papito, calm down.

07:42.330 --> 07:45.990
l've got an old Mexican remedy here
that is much safer than popping it.

07:46.130 --> 07:48.570
My grandmother created it.
lt works every time.

07:48.700 --> 07:52.370
- Oh, thanks, Mom.
- We just smear a little bit of this on,

07:52.510 --> 07:56.880
then we wrap it tight
in the banana bandana.

07:57.210 --> 08:00.910
And voilà, in three days, gone.

08:01.050 --> 08:03.040
Three days?

08:05.320 --> 08:06.880
The prom is tomorrow, Mom.

08:07.020 --> 08:09.850
Oh, l just remembered
a quicker remedy.

08:09.990 --> 08:13.890
Okay, l'm gonna need rubbing alcohol,
a wire brush and a towel for you to bite on.

08:14.030 --> 08:15.550
What?

08:15.700 --> 08:17.320
No.

08:19.800 --> 08:23.130
This thing keeps beeping.
The metal man must be close.

08:23.270 --> 08:26.210
Alex, you're on a metal staircase
with a metal detector.

08:28.040 --> 08:31.440
Oh, l just wasted an hour
going up and down these things.

08:33.350 --> 08:35.080
That puppy's ginormous.

08:35.220 --> 08:38.710
Why don't we just use the acne spell l use
to keep my skin clear and velvety smooth?

08:38.850 --> 08:42.020
Alex, you're chasing a metal man.
l don't think magic's your thing.

08:42.159 --> 08:43.380
l'm doing you a favor.

08:43.520 --> 08:45.460
- Just hold your head still, okay?
- Alex, don't.

08:45.590 --> 08:47.620
- Magic only causes trouble.
- Please, l'm working.

08:47.760 --> 08:51.530
- You got a trophy man running around--
- Murrieta animata, Murrieta animata

08:53.200 --> 08:55.960
What? ls it gone? Did it work?

08:56.100 --> 08:58.200
Not exactly.

08:58.340 --> 09:01.000
That is crazy. Your zit just talked to me.

09:01.140 --> 09:02.770
You should hear me sing.

09:06.210 --> 09:08.580
l'll do anything but country.

09:15.990 --> 09:17.510
What did you just do?

09:17.660 --> 09:21.420
l don't know, you were yelling at me.
l got confused. lt's all your fault.

09:21.560 --> 09:24.050
Dad said to never yell at someone
when they're doing a spell.

09:24.200 --> 09:25.960
He said don't yell
when he's ordering takeout.

09:26.100 --> 09:29.090
He was so peeved
when his pork dumplings didn't come.

09:29.870 --> 09:33.030
He's already mad about the trophy.
lf he finds out about this, we're both hosed.

09:33.170 --> 09:34.840
Excuse me, you're hosed. You did this.

09:34.980 --> 09:38.170
l'm just the guy with the
big gross talking zit on my forehead.

09:38.310 --> 09:41.540
Hello? l'm right here.

09:42.480 --> 09:45.040
Alex, get this thing off of me.

09:45.190 --> 09:46.780
Come on.

09:47.620 --> 09:48.920
l caught the trophy man.

09:49.060 --> 09:51.250
lt was easy.
He was on the hamster wheel.

09:51.390 --> 09:54.020
Hamster? Not too happy about it.

09:54.730 --> 09:57.030
See, Justin? You don't have to get
your boxers in a bunch.

09:57.160 --> 09:58.930
Now Dad will teach us
the un-animation spell,

09:59.070 --> 10:00.560
and your zit problem will be over.

10:00.700 --> 10:05.200
Boy, l didn't even get a chance
to spend Christmas with you guys.

10:06.210 --> 10:08.570
You animated Justin's zit?

10:08.710 --> 10:09.870
Sweet, l want one.

10:10.010 --> 10:11.480
Oh, no, you don't.

10:12.210 --> 10:15.980
- Trophy man kicked me.
- Keep on trucking.

10:18.150 --> 10:19.920
Whoa, hey, he's in my shirt.

10:20.050 --> 10:21.390
lt tickles.

10:23.190 --> 10:24.820
Oh, boy.

10:25.590 --> 10:27.390
Okay.

10:27.900 --> 10:29.560
Okay.

10:34.100 --> 10:35.160
Hey, my underwear.

10:35.770 --> 10:39.570
Hey, you know what?
l was wearing those for 10 straight days.

10:42.240 --> 10:45.680
That's it. l'm calling Miranda
and telling her l can't take her to the prom.

10:45.810 --> 10:47.870
No, no, no, wait. l can talk to Dad.

10:48.020 --> 10:50.850
l'm not gonna let my brother miss out
on what might be his only prom

10:50.990 --> 10:53.920
because of some, what,
ugly, hideous thing on his face.

10:54.050 --> 10:57.350
You guys are really rude to company.

11:05.300 --> 11:08.460
Daddy, your bread's so good,
it's inspirational.

11:08.600 --> 11:10.900
ln fact,
it makes me wanna be a better person.

11:11.040 --> 11:13.060
And l think l'm gonna start
with wizard's training.

11:13.970 --> 11:15.030
Really?

11:15.180 --> 11:19.010
Hey, here's an awesome idea
l just thought of right now.

11:19.150 --> 11:21.080
Why don't you give me
the un-animation spell

11:21.220 --> 11:23.340
you were gonna teach us,
and l'll start working on it?

11:24.250 --> 11:25.310
Oh, yeah.

11:25.450 --> 11:28.790
Why don't l give you the whole spell book,
we'll just call you a wizard?

11:29.690 --> 11:32.520
That sounds like a lot of reading.
l'll just take the one spell for now.

11:34.060 --> 11:37.290
Look.
With wizardry comes responsibility,

11:37.430 --> 11:39.660
and that also means
taking care of your mistakes.

11:39.800 --> 11:42.770
l'm not giving you that spell
until you find that trophy.

11:45.540 --> 11:46.970
Where are you, trophy man?

11:47.110 --> 11:49.300
Mom has a bowling trophy.
She's really cute.

11:49.440 --> 11:50.910
Tight top, short skirt.

11:53.550 --> 11:56.140
Please tell me
you got the un-animation spell from Dad.

11:56.280 --> 11:59.780
- l got the un-animation spell from Dad.
- Oh, really?

11:59.920 --> 12:02.480
No, l just felt like
l owed you some good news.

12:03.660 --> 12:05.920
That thing's so big,
l can't stop looking at it.

12:06.330 --> 12:08.450
But don't worry, l have a better plan.

12:08.600 --> 12:10.460
We're just gonna pop the stupid thing.

12:10.600 --> 12:12.860
Wait! l can help you with the girl.

12:13.000 --> 12:14.760
- What?
- Don't listen to him.

12:14.900 --> 12:18.530
No, no, no.
Oh, Justin, l can really help you.

12:18.670 --> 12:19.900
How?

12:20.040 --> 12:22.670
You were great with the girl
in biology, right?

12:22.810 --> 12:24.800
What were you like outside of class?

12:24.950 --> 12:27.780
Well, l don't know.

12:27.920 --> 12:29.610
''l don't know.''

12:30.050 --> 12:32.250
Hold on. What could you do for him?

12:32.390 --> 12:34.450
Talk him through the rough spots.

12:34.590 --> 12:38.920
He's going with a girl
almost as pretty as you.

12:40.930 --> 12:42.990
Oh, he's good.

12:44.260 --> 12:45.790
l still think it's a mistake.

12:45.930 --> 12:49.100
The mistake is not taking advice

12:49.240 --> 12:52.170
from somebody who's been on
thousands of girls' faces.

12:52.610 --> 12:54.160
l know what they wanna hear.

12:54.310 --> 12:57.440
l know exactly what
you should say to them.

12:57.580 --> 12:59.510
Give me a chance. Come on.

12:59.650 --> 13:02.210
Maybe l could use a wing zit.

13:03.350 --> 13:04.780
Yep, l see absolutely nothing wrong

13:04.920 --> 13:07.510
with letting a growth on your face
tell you what to say to a girl.

13:07.650 --> 13:09.250
Good luck.

13:23.340 --> 13:26.700
You're gonna have to stop sweating.
lt's getting into my eyes.

13:26.840 --> 13:28.310
When are you gonna start helping me?

13:28.440 --> 13:30.470
l've been talking about biology.
That's all l got.

13:30.610 --> 13:33.340
l know.
She almost jumped out of the cab

13:33.480 --> 13:38.540
when you kept going on and on
about deoxyribonucleic acid.

13:38.690 --> 13:40.980
Just say what l say.

13:42.360 --> 13:43.410
Here she comes.

13:44.960 --> 13:48.220
Well, Denise says we look cute together.
And she loves your jacket.

13:48.360 --> 13:50.760
- You're the one who looks great.
- Thank you.

13:50.930 --> 13:52.230
Not you, the girl.

13:53.200 --> 13:56.530
- You're the one who looks great.
- Well, thanks. You're sweet.

13:56.670 --> 13:58.330
- No, you're sweet.
- That's lame.

13:58.470 --> 14:00.630
- Don't ad-lib.
- Right.

14:01.810 --> 14:04.540
- Well, you wanna dance?
- Sure.

14:05.410 --> 14:06.940
What do you know about dancing?

14:07.080 --> 14:09.070
Nothing. l'm a zit.

14:09.220 --> 14:12.810
Put the hat down.
l don't wanna see this train wreck.

14:24.030 --> 14:25.760
You're a really good dancer.

14:25.900 --> 14:27.630
Justin's got a girlfriend.

14:27.770 --> 14:30.740
- She's not my girlfriend.
- Girlfriend?

14:31.670 --> 14:33.940
Don't panic. Hang in there.

14:34.070 --> 14:36.040
Well, okay.

14:36.180 --> 14:38.170
l'm your girlfriend.

14:38.850 --> 14:41.440
Wow, l never thought
l'd be so grateful to a zit.

14:42.720 --> 14:44.120
Now you got your girl.

14:44.250 --> 14:47.450
Now it's time
for the Z-Man to have some fun.

14:47.590 --> 14:50.490
Hey. You come with a fire extinguisher?

14:50.620 --> 14:52.820
Because you're smoking hot.

14:54.330 --> 14:55.960
What? How did you do that?

14:57.300 --> 14:58.360
Do what?

14:58.500 --> 15:01.490
l thought l heard you talk
while you were drinking.

15:01.640 --> 15:02.970
That wasn't me.

15:03.100 --> 15:06.560
Hey, baby. Have the cupcake.

15:06.710 --> 15:09.040
And eat it real slow.

15:10.940 --> 15:13.710
That was you. That's rude.

15:14.150 --> 15:16.140
l'm sorry. Hold on.

15:18.920 --> 15:22.690
- What are you doing?
- Oh, come on, dude. Lighten up.

15:22.820 --> 15:25.690
l got you the girl,
now it's my turn to have some fun.

15:27.090 --> 15:30.030
Hey, beautiful.
Can l talk to your boyfriend?

15:33.430 --> 15:34.830
That's it. l'm popping you.

15:34.970 --> 15:37.600
Not so fast, lover boy.

15:37.740 --> 15:40.540
Get a load of me. l'm engorged.

15:40.670 --> 15:43.580
You pop me and we both go down.

15:44.980 --> 15:46.540
Hey, zebra.

15:46.680 --> 15:48.740
Were you just
making monkey sounds at me?

15:48.880 --> 15:52.080
Oh, look who's learned his animals.

15:55.990 --> 15:58.050
Hey, you caught trophy man.

15:58.190 --> 16:00.890
Yup, nothing like a duct-tape
finish line to save the day.

16:01.030 --> 16:03.290
Look, he's still trying to get out.

16:04.830 --> 16:05.890
Oh, it's Justin.

16:06.570 --> 16:08.690
Hey, how's prom?

16:08.840 --> 16:11.100
What? Huge 1 1th graders?

16:11.510 --> 16:13.370
How many? Look, l feel bad.

16:13.510 --> 16:16.140
l'll get the spell from Dad
and l'll be there as fast as l can.

16:16.280 --> 16:19.270
Max, l gotta go help Justin at prom.
Go get my jacket, the really cute one.

16:19.410 --> 16:22.010
The one that cinches at the waist
with all the little buttons. Go.

16:22.520 --> 16:25.210
- Oh, and my matching purse.
- l know the one.

16:25.620 --> 16:26.980
Daddy.

16:27.120 --> 16:28.990
- l caught the trophy man.
- Great.

16:29.120 --> 16:31.490
You wanna give me
the un-animation spell now?

16:31.630 --> 16:33.250
Look, before we get into that,

16:33.390 --> 16:36.520
we need to sit down
and have a long, serious talk.

16:36.660 --> 16:38.600
l know, l know.
l'm grounded for three weeks.

16:39.000 --> 16:40.730
How did you come up with
three weeks?

16:40.870 --> 16:42.360
One for using magic behind your back,

16:42.500 --> 16:44.700
another for letting the trophy man
run around the house,

16:44.840 --> 16:48.070
and the last one for future trouble
l'll probably be getting into.

16:49.110 --> 16:51.410
Well, that's one more week
than l would have come up with,

16:51.550 --> 16:52.600
but we'll go with that.

16:53.880 --> 16:57.650
Okay, say, ''garibay immobilitay,''

16:57.780 --> 17:00.150
Garibay immobilitay

17:00.820 --> 17:02.580
Great.

17:04.660 --> 17:07.890
Even though l don't got it anymore,
l still got it.

17:08.030 --> 17:10.550
l like the way l deal with problems.

17:12.930 --> 17:16.160
l think this purse
goes better with this jacket.

17:17.400 --> 17:18.890
Now l got another problem.

17:21.170 --> 17:23.540
Guys, when l implied
you didn't know your animals,

17:23.680 --> 17:25.109
what l meant was...

17:25.250 --> 17:27.180
You know,
three against one really isn't fair.

17:27.310 --> 17:29.750
Yeah.
l don't know a lot of what you just said,

17:29.880 --> 17:32.750
but let's see if you can say it again
without any teeth.

17:33.750 --> 17:36.190
Hey, Brian.
There's some loser in the hallway

17:36.320 --> 17:38.420
who says that you can't do
20 fingertip push-ups.

17:38.560 --> 17:40.920
Everyone knows l can do 50.

17:41.060 --> 17:43.260
Come on, let's go show him.

17:44.030 --> 17:45.860
- Thanks, Miranda.
- Don't thank me.

17:46.000 --> 17:48.760
l wanna know what's going on.
You're acting like two different people.

17:48.900 --> 17:50.270
l'm sorry. l know l'm being weird.

17:50.400 --> 17:53.700
lt's just that l really like you,
and nothing's going right.

17:53.840 --> 17:56.870
- l like you too.
- Can we start all over?

17:57.880 --> 17:59.370
Sure.

18:00.650 --> 18:02.880
Just a hug?
l can get that from Grandma.

18:03.020 --> 18:05.010
How about some lip action?

18:05.150 --> 18:08.590
- There you go again. You're a pig.
- Miranda.

18:08.720 --> 18:11.490
- Wait.
- Dude, help me out here.

18:11.630 --> 18:14.860
l need a break. My hair gone a little flat.
l gotta go pump it up.

18:15.000 --> 18:16.430
What? But--

18:16.560 --> 18:18.260
- But l'm not--
- Don't worry.

18:18.400 --> 18:20.160
Yo. Everybody listen up.

18:20.300 --> 18:23.900
We got a guest DJ in the Kansas Room
in the Town and Country Suites.

18:24.040 --> 18:27.100
Give it up for DJ Mad Hatter.

18:28.580 --> 18:30.170
Yeah.

18:32.450 --> 18:36.510
Justin in the hiz-house.
Let's raise the ceiling. Hoot, hoot.

18:37.920 --> 18:40.180
And this is a fast one for all the ladies,

18:40.320 --> 18:44.950
because l loves to watch you
shake that junk.

18:46.990 --> 18:50.520
- There's nobody in the hallway.
- We must have scared him away.

18:50.660 --> 18:55.430
Oh, hey, look,
Justin Timberlame is up on the DJ stand.

18:55.570 --> 18:59.730
- You know, let's take that freak down.
- Hey, guys. You wanna dance?

18:59.870 --> 19:01.740
Hey.

19:01.880 --> 19:05.040
Why would we wanna dance
with an eighth grader?

19:05.180 --> 19:07.040
Get lost.

19:07.180 --> 19:09.880
l'm in ninth grade, you big idiots.

19:14.820 --> 19:16.050
What took you so long?

19:16.190 --> 19:19.280
lf you wanna know, l missed the A train.
l had to catch the bus on 4th Street,

19:19.430 --> 19:22.330
where this guy
was selling the cutest earrings--

19:22.460 --> 19:23.550
Just do the spell.

19:23.700 --> 19:25.670
No. Stop.

19:26.500 --> 19:28.370
Don't do it.

19:28.670 --> 19:31.140
l can teach you how to drive.

19:31.270 --> 19:33.870
Garibay immobilitay

19:34.810 --> 19:35.870
- Did it work?
- Yup.

19:36.010 --> 19:38.530
You're back to your regular,
pimple-faced dorky self.

19:39.150 --> 19:41.550
- Thanks.
- No, l'm sorry l got you into this.

19:41.680 --> 19:43.810
Now go out there
and get your older woman.

19:47.190 --> 19:48.550
Excuse me.

19:48.690 --> 19:52.250
l'd like to apologize
to Miranda Hampson for the way l acted.

19:52.390 --> 19:54.050
Miranda?

19:56.230 --> 19:57.700
l'm not wearing my hat, am l?

19:57.830 --> 20:01.320
Good job. Now pop that sucker and run.
That's all you got. See you at home.

20:09.140 --> 20:10.940
Hey, Justin.

20:12.750 --> 20:14.340
Hey, Miranda.

20:14.480 --> 20:17.610
Miranda wanted to talk to you because
l told her why you were acting so weird.

20:17.750 --> 20:20.020
Yeah, why didn't you just tell me
you had a big zit?

20:20.150 --> 20:23.780
l would have understood.
l've got one too.

20:23.920 --> 20:25.190
Oh, man.

20:25.330 --> 20:27.350
Yeah, that's a honker.

20:29.360 --> 20:31.390
Sorry, you two wanna be alone.

20:36.140 --> 20:40.100
- Look, l was so nervous about tonight.
- Why?

20:40.240 --> 20:42.070
Well, because l've never been
to a junior prom

20:42.210 --> 20:44.110
with an older woman that l really like.

20:44.240 --> 20:45.580
Oh, that's okay.

20:45.710 --> 20:48.550
Because l kind of like
this one younger guy right now.

20:49.080 --> 20:51.550
Oh, that's cool.

20:51.690 --> 20:54.210
l understand. Good luck with him.

20:54.350 --> 20:56.290
She means you, stupid.

20:58.690 --> 21:00.820
Right. Yeah, me.

21:07.200 --> 21:09.290
Oh, okay.

21:10.770 --> 21:12.860
Well, l gotta get home.

21:16.010 --> 21:18.940
- See you in school.
- Not if l see you first.

21:19.350 --> 21:21.940
- Stop trying to be cool.
- Okay.

21:23.850 --> 21:25.510
Thank you so much
for bringing Miranda.

21:25.650 --> 21:27.180
That's okay. l kind of owed it to you.

21:27.320 --> 21:29.720
You know,
giving you the talking zit and everything.

21:29.860 --> 21:31.080
But l'm kind of gonna miss him.

21:31.260 --> 21:34.460
He was the only one around here
who was almost as clever as me.

21:34.630 --> 21:37.890
Yup, you're so clever.
Hey, you wanna go get some ice cream?

21:38.030 --> 21:39.520
Sure.

21:43.870 --> 21:46.100
Yup, you're so clever.
Now you're locked out.

21:46.240 --> 21:49.470
That's okay. l'll catch up with Miranda
and tell her about your doll collection.

21:53.310 --> 21:56.440
They're action figures. They're not...

21:59.220 --> 22:01.450
So how long have you been
in this line of work?

22:01.590 --> 22:04.280
Oh, since the first Olympics.
But l was just on a medal back then.

22:04.420 --> 22:07.150
- l've done all kinds of trophies.
- What about tennis?

22:10.760 --> 22:12.060
World's fastest typist?

22:15.100 --> 22:16.970
Yeah. Oh, you know
what other trophy l've done?

22:17.100 --> 22:18.160
World's greatest kisser.

22:18.310 --> 22:20.970
All right, all right.
lt's past everybody's bedtime.

22:21.110 --> 22:23.700
lt's time for you
to get back on the pedestal. Alex?
