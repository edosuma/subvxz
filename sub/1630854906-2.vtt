WEBVTT

00:11.262 --> 00:12.805
Black 26.

00:13.723 --> 00:15.057
Baby, I need more chips.

00:15.057 --> 00:16.642
Absolutely not.

00:16.642 --> 00:19.270
You just lost $100,000.
That's not a bet.

00:19.270 --> 00:21.897
That's a down payment
on someone's house.

00:21.897 --> 00:25.067
Oh, please, baby.
You can afford it.

00:25.067 --> 00:26.652
Is there a problem?

00:26.652 --> 00:28.154
I'm sorry, Anika.

00:28.154 --> 00:29.989
I'm not letting her lose
any more of my money.

00:29.989 --> 00:31.991
Your money?
Mr. Luppina,

00:31.991 --> 00:34.160
what would your wife say
if she knew you were here?

00:34.160 --> 00:36.245
She thinks you're in Dubai,
on business.

00:36.245 --> 00:38.748
Her family's business.

00:38.748 --> 00:40.332
How are the kids, by the way?

00:40.332 --> 00:43.669
Your daughter must be,
what, early 20s by now?

00:45.796 --> 00:47.506
- Yeah.
- Anika.

00:49.675 --> 00:51.385
Mr. Cullen, may I help you?

00:51.385 --> 00:53.137
I need to talk to you a minute.

00:55.181 --> 00:57.057
I've been vetting the whales
you're bringing in

00:57.057 --> 00:59.602
for your private game
this coming Wednesday.

00:59.602 --> 01:01.103
An impressive list.

01:01.103 --> 01:03.564
A hundred million on the tables
in that room.

01:03.564 --> 01:05.524
- You're welcome.
- I'm curious.

01:05.524 --> 01:07.401
Most of these people
are your regulars--

01:07.401 --> 01:08.819
Either here or at other parlors,

01:08.819 --> 01:11.071
but there's a name I've never seen.

01:11.071 --> 01:13.491
A Mr. Yao Liang.

01:13.491 --> 01:15.701
And you want to arrange
for the casino to extend

01:15.701 --> 01:18.287
a $15 million line of credit to him.

01:18.287 --> 01:19.955
I don't hear a question.

01:19.955 --> 01:23.584
I've done my due diligence,
and that person doesn't exist.

01:24.502 --> 01:27.588
You don't need to worry
who my players are.

01:28.297 --> 01:31.050
I'm paid to worry,
and I'm filing this with

01:31.050 --> 01:33.052
the ACT Racing
and Gambling Commission.

01:34.303 --> 01:35.930
You have the house
advantage here.

01:46.023 --> 01:48.692
What are you doing?

01:48.692 --> 01:50.277
Ohh!

01:58.869 --> 02:00.496
I'm sorry.

02:00.496 --> 02:02.289
Maybe we didn't get to know
each other very well.

02:02.289 --> 02:04.291
I'm in and out of here so fast.

02:04.291 --> 02:06.669
Or maybe we got off on the wrong foot.

02:07.920 --> 02:10.089
I want you to be
comfortable with me.

02:10.089 --> 02:12.424
I want you to be comfortable
when you leave the house

02:12.424 --> 02:16.220
in the morning and start up
that sexy Holden HK Monaro.

02:16.220 --> 02:19.515
Comfortable that the ignition
doesn't ignite an incendiary device

02:19.515 --> 02:21.392
packed with EPX-1,

02:21.392 --> 02:25.396
which has the highest detonation velocity
of all plastic explosives.

02:27.857 --> 02:29.191
Comfortable?

02:32.361 --> 02:33.737
Good.

02:43.372 --> 02:45.249
Meera Malik's daughter?

02:45.249 --> 02:47.501
After all these years?

02:47.501 --> 02:50.588
On loan from MI6
on a provisional basis.

02:50.588 --> 02:52.298
She just lost her whole team to Wujing.

02:52.298 --> 02:54.383
She has skin in this game.

02:54.383 --> 02:58.596
Well, if she's anything like her mother,
she'll be a keen asset.

02:58.596 --> 03:00.222
With a discerning eye.

03:00.222 --> 03:02.016
And you'll be okay with her?

03:02.016 --> 03:04.935
I believe the question is
whether she'll be okay with me.

03:04.935 --> 03:08.105
She's been fully read-in.
She knows what she's signing up for.

03:09.815 --> 03:12.067
Ms. Malik, your government
is in agreement,

03:12.067 --> 03:14.153
your security clearance
has been authorized,

03:14.153 --> 03:16.030
and you understand what we do here?

03:16.030 --> 03:18.949
You work with a very high-level
confidential informant.

03:18.949 --> 03:20.367
I've been debriefed on this.

03:20.367 --> 03:22.703
Not just any informant.

03:22.703 --> 03:26.040
We work with Raymond Reddington.
It's a symbiotic relationship.

03:26.040 --> 03:29.209
On balance, it's a net plus
for us and the work we do.

03:29.209 --> 03:30.669
He's invaluable.

03:31.253 --> 03:34.423
You realize now that you know this,
there's no going back?

03:34.423 --> 03:38.302
My mother knew all of this, too,
and she still chose the work.

03:38.302 --> 03:39.887
She did.

03:39.887 --> 03:42.473
Then what time should I be here
Monday morning?

03:43.933 --> 03:46.226
I look forward to meeting her.

03:46.226 --> 03:48.437
See anything you like up there?

03:48.437 --> 03:51.774
What are we doing here, Red?
This is not the most discreet.

03:51.982 --> 03:54.735
Street food, Harold.
I'm on a pilgrimage.

03:54.735 --> 03:57.196
I won't stop until
I've tried it all.

03:57.196 --> 04:00.574
The pan-seared brains are
supposed to be delicious here.

04:00.574 --> 04:03.327
Ooh, peppery goat breast. Hi.

04:03.327 --> 04:08.207
Okay, we'll take
the number one, three, the five,

04:08.207 --> 04:10.501
and I guess the seven.

04:10.501 --> 04:12.711
Odds today, evens tomorrow.

04:12.711 --> 04:14.922
Homan. Live like you're dying.

04:14.922 --> 04:16.465
Am I right, Harold?

04:19.760 --> 04:22.346
I just spent three hours
on a train from DC.

04:22.346 --> 04:24.348
Ooh, I love that trip.

04:24.348 --> 04:26.433
Three hours of peace and quiet.

04:26.433 --> 04:28.769
The low rumble of the rails.

04:28.769 --> 04:31.605
And a very nice ham
and cheese sandwich, I must say.

04:31.605 --> 04:33.482
Please. Wujing.

04:33.482 --> 04:35.609
What are we doing?
Have there been any updates?

04:35.609 --> 04:38.445
It appears he's out there
marshaling his forces.

04:38.445 --> 04:41.156
And for some reason,
you've disbanded yours.

04:41.156 --> 04:42.992
I'm hearing you don't even
have security.

04:42.992 --> 04:44.785
Keeping a lighter footprint.

04:44.785 --> 04:47.204
Simpler all around.

04:47.204 --> 04:49.832
We know what he's up to.
The question is where.

04:49.832 --> 04:51.750
In the last week and a half,

04:51.750 --> 04:56.672
Wujing's been spotted in
Monaco, Lisbon, Klerksdorp, South Africa.

04:56.672 --> 04:59.383
Do you know what all
those locations have in common?

04:59.383 --> 05:01.176
Not off the top of my head.

05:01.176 --> 05:03.387
Casinos, Harold.

05:03.387 --> 05:06.807
Wujing is frequently
somewhat fancier surroundings,

05:06.807 --> 05:11.603
I assume in the hopes of
falling in with a fancier set of friends.

05:11.603 --> 05:14.732
The associates of mine
who spotted him in Monaco

05:14.732 --> 05:18.485
saw him with an Australian
woman named Anika de Beer.

05:18.485 --> 05:20.279
De Beer? Who is she?

05:20.279 --> 05:23.699
In the world of gambling,
de Beer is known as the Whaler.

05:23.699 --> 05:28.162
She's a freelancer who pulls
in high-rollers to casinos.

05:28.162 --> 05:29.830
She works across the globe.

05:29.830 --> 05:32.583
After Monaco, she flew to
the Crown Rocks in Sydney.

05:32.583 --> 05:34.960
This is a formidable woman.

05:34.960 --> 05:38.213
She'd do anything to get
whales to the table.

05:38.213 --> 05:40.716
What does he want with her?
Is this all about money?

05:40.716 --> 05:42.468
Too many things
in life are.

05:42.468 --> 05:43.802
The same man out gathering
an army

05:43.802 --> 05:45.387
isn't taking time
to gamble, is he?

05:45.387 --> 05:47.681
I don't know, but de Beer might.

05:47.681 --> 05:49.308
She's our best lead.

05:52.728 --> 05:53.896
Char?

05:54.772 --> 05:56.106
Is everything all right?

05:57.107 --> 05:58.734
Oh, no. Not again.

05:58.734 --> 06:01.028
She didn't say anything
after school yesterday.

06:02.821 --> 06:04.698
Sure, I can be free
to meet Wednesday.

06:04.698 --> 06:07.201
Is it just with the teacher?

06:07.201 --> 06:09.745
Okay, hon.
See you when I get home.

06:09.745 --> 06:10.913
Bye.

06:13.499 --> 06:15.209
Is there a problem with Agnes?

06:16.085 --> 06:19.421
Agnes is having some trouble
with a bully at school.

06:19.421 --> 06:21.673
An older girl. But we're handling it.

06:21.673 --> 06:23.675
Anything I can do to help?

06:23.675 --> 06:26.470
Thank you, but Agnes
already has two parents,

06:26.470 --> 06:30.140
and it's our belief that she
needs to work this out herself.

06:32.976 --> 06:34.686
Order's up. Homan.

06:36.480 --> 06:37.689
I've got this.

06:37.689 --> 06:40.317
Whatever you and Charlene
think is best, Harold.

06:40.317 --> 06:42.319
But we better working
on our working lunch,

06:42.319 --> 06:46.657
because I believe this Whaler
is now our best chance

06:46.657 --> 06:48.158
at getting to Wujing.

06:52.746 --> 06:56.333
I want you gentlemen to welcome
the newest member of our team.

06:56.333 --> 06:58.460
- Siya?
- Hello.

06:58.460 --> 07:02.339
I just want to say that
I'm excited about being here.

07:02.339 --> 07:05.425
I know my mother felt proud
of what she did in this place,

07:05.425 --> 07:08.303
and I'm looking forward
to feeling the same way.

07:08.303 --> 07:09.805
It's good to have you.

07:15.978 --> 07:17.604
Aram made it look so easy.

07:17.604 --> 07:19.523
Here, uh, let me help with that.

07:23.068 --> 07:24.695
Thanks, Agent Malik.

07:24.695 --> 07:26.363
Right. Anika de Beer.

07:26.363 --> 07:28.365
Casinos around the world
treat her like royalty

07:28.365 --> 07:30.409
because her client list
is so impressive.

07:30.409 --> 07:34.121
Millionaires, billionaires,
tech giants, industry tycoons,

07:34.121 --> 07:37.124
and some of the best players
ever to touch a deck of cards.

07:37.124 --> 07:39.835
She's working with Wujing,
but we don't know to what end.

07:39.835 --> 07:42.045
Could they be planning something
with one of de Beer's whales?

07:42.045 --> 07:45.924
Big gamblers, big bank accounts.
That's a lot of very powerful people.

07:45.924 --> 07:49.678
Is it possible Wujing might be targeting
some or one of these players?

07:49.678 --> 07:51.096
You just might be
onto something.

07:51.096 --> 07:52.890
Reddington has informed me

07:52.890 --> 07:55.225
that she's bringing a group
of the biggest whales on her roster

07:55.225 --> 07:57.728
to the Crown Rocks Casino
in Sydney, Australia,

07:57.728 --> 08:00.772
in two days' time for a
private game of Texas Hold 'Em.

08:00.772 --> 08:02.524
Whatever she and Wujing
are doing,

08:02.524 --> 08:04.776
the timing of this upcoming
tournament feels suspicious.

08:04.776 --> 08:06.111
So, what's the plan?

08:06.111 --> 08:07.863
Well, if we want to get
to de Beer,

08:07.863 --> 08:10.365
we know exactly where
she'll be in 48 hours.

08:10.365 --> 08:12.201
Reddington also informed me

08:12.201 --> 08:15.787
that there are still a few open
chairs for her Sydney game.

08:15.787 --> 08:18.373
- So, we're going into that game?
- How?

08:20.167 --> 08:21.752
This is Spencer Waters.

08:21.752 --> 08:23.420
Waters is a wealthy music promoter

08:23.420 --> 08:25.464
and owner of the
Alcazar Theatre in New York.

08:25.464 --> 08:27.674
He's also the organizer
of one of the richest

08:27.674 --> 08:29.801
poker game pots
on the East Coast.

08:29.801 --> 08:32.304
It's a monthly underground game.
Millions on the table.

08:32.304 --> 08:34.556
No one gains entry
without Waters' approval.

08:34.556 --> 08:36.058
The Whaler
is known to have eyes

08:36.058 --> 08:37.893
in the biggest card rooms
around the world,

08:37.893 --> 08:39.311
so if we want her attention,

08:39.311 --> 08:41.897
we'll need to make a splash
in Waters' game.

08:41.897 --> 08:45.025
Reddington's already working
on an invitation.

08:45.025 --> 08:46.443
I gotta admit.

08:46.443 --> 08:47.903
I'm a little nervous
sitting here, Mister--

08:47.903 --> 08:50.155
Oh, please, Spencer,
it's Raymond.

08:50.155 --> 08:53.617
Although, Steve Jones always
calls me "Rotten Ray."

08:53.617 --> 08:56.787
In fact, I did a little guest
DJ thing with him

08:56.787 --> 08:59.998
on "Jonesy's Jukebox"
using that moniker.

08:59.998 --> 09:02.084
Apparently, Johnny got pissed off

09:02.084 --> 09:04.670
thinking we were making fun
at his expense.

09:04.670 --> 09:06.838
Which maybe we were,
or maybe we weren't.

09:06.838 --> 09:08.257
I don't know.

09:08.257 --> 09:10.592
It doesn't take much
to piss off John.

09:10.592 --> 09:14.554
Steve Jones? Johnny Rotten?
Seems like you got a lot of friends.

09:14.554 --> 09:17.015
That phone call I got from, uh,
Huey Lewis' manager--

09:17.015 --> 09:18.558
Jerry. Yes.

09:18.558 --> 09:22.145
Yeah, he told me about that, uh,
favor that you did for him once.

09:22.145 --> 09:25.357
Well, technically, it was
for an associate of Jerry's,

09:25.357 --> 09:27.234
but Jerry benefited.

09:27.943 --> 09:31.113
But I prefer to leave
past business in the past.

09:31.113 --> 09:33.282
Let's talk about the future.

09:34.032 --> 09:38.120
I'm someone who can do quite
a lot when it comes to favors

09:38.120 --> 09:40.956
for a person
with a fertile imagination.

09:40.956 --> 09:42.958
A favor for me?

09:42.958 --> 09:45.419
- In return for...
- A favor for me.

09:45.419 --> 09:47.629
Well, actually, it's for a friend.

09:47.629 --> 09:50.090
A friend who enjoys playing cards.

09:50.966 --> 09:52.217
I see.

09:53.218 --> 09:55.679
Is your friend any good?

09:55.679 --> 09:57.389
Spencer, if it's a friend of mine,

09:57.389 --> 10:00.559
they're either the very best
or the most fun.

10:00.559 --> 10:02.477
Often both.

10:04.479 --> 10:06.940
I apologize for our
disagreement yesterday.

10:06.940 --> 10:08.775
That was unfortunate.

10:08.775 --> 10:11.445
Now, what can you arrange
for me here?

10:11.445 --> 10:15.240
As requested, you'll have
the entire room reserved for your event.

10:15.240 --> 10:18.201
The lift is private
and dedicated to this floor.

10:18.201 --> 10:20.203
You'll have a checkpoint
at the entrance

10:20.203 --> 10:22.289
with handheld
metal detectors.

10:22.289 --> 10:25.334
Fire exits will be locked
during the length of game play,

10:25.334 --> 10:28.837
but will open automatically in the event
the fire alarm is tripped.

10:28.837 --> 10:30.547
What about security?

10:30.547 --> 10:32.632
Would you like some of our team
made available to you?

10:32.632 --> 10:33.800
No, thank you.

10:33.800 --> 10:36.720
I use my own people
for events like this-- always.

10:37.220 --> 10:38.722
Now,

10:38.722 --> 10:40.557
what about my list
of players?

10:42.142 --> 10:43.602
Fully approved.

10:44.436 --> 10:45.854
How many of our Sky Villas

10:45.854 --> 10:47.689
would you like available
to you for the evening?

10:47.689 --> 10:49.107
All of them.

10:49.107 --> 10:51.526
And tell me, which one is
the most private?

11:02.537 --> 11:04.706
Ah. Welcome.

11:04.706 --> 11:06.208
What's all this for?

11:06.208 --> 11:09.127
Your costumes, Donald.
For the theater this evening.

11:09.127 --> 11:12.172
Ms. Malik, please allow me
to introduce myself.

11:12.172 --> 11:14.007
You're a man of wealth and taste?

11:14.007 --> 11:16.426
Clever.

11:16.426 --> 11:18.470
I'm Raymond Reddington. Please.

11:22.599 --> 11:25.102
I knew your mother
many years ago.

11:25.102 --> 11:26.812
And what did she think of you?

11:26.812 --> 11:30.023
I don't know if she ever
liked me very much.

11:30.023 --> 11:34.152
Mr. Reddington, you and I
don't need to be friends with one another.

11:34.152 --> 11:37.823
Like my mother,
I'm also extremely capable.

11:37.823 --> 11:40.409
I can liaise with you,
work beside you,

11:40.409 --> 11:41.868
smile at your jokes,

11:41.868 --> 11:45.163
but this is a professional
relationship to me.

11:45.163 --> 11:46.581
Nothing more.

11:47.207 --> 11:49.167
Practiced that, have you?

11:51.461 --> 11:53.422
You mind walking us through this?

11:54.673 --> 11:57.092
For Spencer Waters' poker game,

11:57.092 --> 12:00.053
I took the liberty of having
an associate of mine

12:00.053 --> 12:03.640
concoct a flawless
fake identity-- E.M. Lyons,

12:03.640 --> 12:07.644
buried several layers deep in
a couple of dozen databases.

12:07.978 --> 12:10.730
Lyons will play in
the game tonight

12:10.730 --> 12:14.734
with Waters' full endorsement
and my financial backing.

12:15.610 --> 12:18.697
It's the best chance we have
of baiting the Whaler.

12:18.822 --> 12:22.117
Oh, and Lyons is allowed a plus one.

12:22.325 --> 12:26.163
So, Agent Ressler
poses as Lyons and I'm the arm candy?

12:26.163 --> 12:27.456
Is that it?

12:27.456 --> 12:32.377
On the contrary, Emilia Marie Lyons
will sit at the card table,

12:32.377 --> 12:35.338
and Donald will be
the arm candy.

12:37.716 --> 12:39.801
- Come again?
- These are poker players.

12:39.801 --> 12:44.556
Experts in bluffing and deception,
reading people.

12:45.348 --> 12:47.017
It has to be Siya.

12:47.017 --> 12:49.269
They're less likely to see her coming.

12:50.145 --> 12:51.897
She's not ready for this.

12:51.897 --> 12:55.066
I have a feeling any daughter
of Meera Malik

12:55.066 --> 12:58.278
will be smart and quick
on her feet, and you, Donald,

12:58.278 --> 13:01.281
will be more believable
as her bank and much better

13:01.281 --> 13:03.783
as the eyes and ears
watching her back.

13:03.783 --> 13:07.329
If I were in a pinch,
I'd want you watching mine.

13:07.579 --> 13:09.789
I don't suppose it makes
a difference to anyone

13:09.789 --> 13:11.833
that I don't know
how to play poker?

13:11.833 --> 13:14.878
Well, that's where
Mr. Endicott comes in.

13:14.878 --> 13:18.757
His services are available
to you for as long as you need.

13:18.757 --> 13:21.551
A bit of a crash course, if you will.

13:21.551 --> 13:25.305
Learn the mechanics
of the game, pick out some new threads.

13:25.305 --> 13:29.184
There's some lovely items
over there for your choosing.

13:29.184 --> 13:31.728
I'll be off. Errands to run.

13:31.728 --> 13:34.356
But I'll be rooting
for the debut of

13:34.356 --> 13:38.443
Ms. Lyons and her trusty
bankroll tonight.

13:38.443 --> 13:40.445
Good luck.

13:44.866 --> 13:47.035
"She's not ready for this"?

13:47.035 --> 13:49.037
May I ask what your issue is?

13:49.037 --> 13:51.373
You have no idea what you're
inviting in with this job.

13:51.373 --> 13:53.250
I mean, this is how he operates.

13:53.250 --> 13:55.126
He has no idea putting somebody
out on a limb,

13:55.126 --> 13:57.212
because he's out
there himself.

13:57.212 --> 14:00.215
There's no line he won't cross,
Agent Malik.

14:00.215 --> 14:02.175
I'll be there when
you figure that out.

14:26.616 --> 14:28.660
Great job today, Agnes.

14:28.660 --> 14:30.579
Why are you being so sarcastic?

14:31.913 --> 14:33.915
What? No! I did.
What do you mean?

14:33.915 --> 14:35.166
"I did."

14:35.166 --> 14:37.127
What? No. I'm on this team.

14:37.127 --> 14:39.504
Get away from me!
What are you doing?

14:41.089 --> 14:42.549
Agnes!

14:42.549 --> 14:45.302
What happens to kids
that makes them this way?

14:56.313 --> 14:57.480
Emilia.

14:57.480 --> 14:59.024
Spencer.

14:59.024 --> 15:00.775
How are you, gorgeous?

15:00.775 --> 15:02.861
I thought you had shows
all this week?

15:02.861 --> 15:05.280
Ah, Robert Plant canceled
on me last minute.

15:05.280 --> 15:08.116
Oh. Who are you gonna sell
overpriced cocktails to now?

15:08.116 --> 15:11.411
I think I'll sell 'em to you
and your gentleman friend here.

15:11.411 --> 15:13.246
- He's the bank.
- I'm the bank.

15:13.246 --> 15:14.873
The bank's always welcome.

15:14.873 --> 15:16.499
Just can't have you
near the tables, I'm afraid.

15:16.499 --> 15:18.168
If you make yourself
comfortable, plenty of food

15:18.168 --> 15:19.669
and booze in the wings with
the rest of the guests.

15:19.669 --> 15:21.338
Emilia, I'll show you
to your table.

15:21.338 --> 15:23.214
Right this way.

spending your man's money?

17:17.203 --> 17:21.750
You want to keep trying to piss me off,
or should we just play cards?

17:45.106 --> 17:47.275
How much you got left there,
short stack?

17:48.276 --> 17:49.736
You feeling lucky?

17:54.908 --> 17:56.284
I'm putting you all in.

17:57.368 --> 17:59.996

18:15.303 --> 18:17.263
You went all in with two fives?

18:17.263 --> 18:18.681
With three face cards showing?

18:18.681 --> 18:20.099
You didn't know what I had here.

18:20.099 --> 18:24.229
Oh, I knew. I watched you win,
so I'd know the moment you were losing.

18:24.229 --> 18:25.563
Remember?

18:25.563 --> 18:28.274
That's when you called me
"short stack."

18:34.030 --> 18:35.698
Is your player free to talk?

18:35.698 --> 18:38.868
Now that she has all the chips, sure.

18:38.868 --> 18:40.912
Excuse me.

18:46.000 --> 18:47.877
My employer would like a word.

18:50.380 --> 18:51.506
Hello?

18:51.506 --> 18:54.050
<i>There's my wild card.
That was an impressive play.</i>

18:54.050 --> 18:55.969
<i>You waited him out
and took him by surprise.</i>

18:55.969 --> 18:57.679
I suppose that's the game.

18:57.679 --> 18:59.681
<i>I'm hosting an event down
in Sydney tomorrow.</i>

18:59.681 --> 19:01.975
<i>I can send a Gulfstream
for you and your bank.</i>

19:01.975 --> 19:03.810
<i>Travel, hotel-- all on me.</i>

19:03.810 --> 19:06.020
<i>I have some talented players
coming, but I'd love</i>

19:06.020 --> 19:08.106
<i>to see you shake things
up like you did there tonight.</i>

19:08.106 --> 19:09.524
I'll try my best.

19:09.524 --> 19:11.484
<i>That's worth the jet fuel alone.</i>

19:11.484 --> 19:12.986
<i>I'll see you soon.</i>

19:14.612 --> 19:16.739
We're going to Australia.

19:23.246 --> 19:26.207
You barely said a word to me
on the plane ride down.

19:26.207 --> 19:29.043
Do you want to continue
what you started back in DC?

19:29.043 --> 19:31.170
I was being honest in Washington.

19:31.170 --> 19:33.756
You don't think I understand
what this job is?

19:33.756 --> 19:37.051
Well, I think you understand it fine,
and you're ignoring the dangers.

19:37.051 --> 19:40.471
Or maybe you understand those,
too, and you just don't care.

19:40.471 --> 19:42.765
I'm not reckless, Agent Ressler.

19:42.765 --> 19:44.893
Neither was your mother,
and look where it got her.

19:47.979 --> 19:49.480
I'm sorry.

19:49.480 --> 19:51.524
I've seen this job tear down
a lot of people.

19:51.774 --> 19:54.986
I saw it kill a woman I loved
very much named Elizabeth.

19:55.570 --> 19:57.989
I saw it kill your mother.
It's nothing personal.

19:57.989 --> 20:00.241
You seem very good
at what you do.

20:00.241 --> 20:04.245
I'm just not sure I want
to see it tear you down, too.

20:06.497 --> 20:08.917
I appreciate that. I do.

20:08.917 --> 20:11.085
But I can handle myself.

20:32.774 --> 20:35.568
They're taking
every precaution here.

20:35.568 --> 20:37.946
Yes. Let's hope that we have.

20:42.033 --> 20:44.494
Please, make yourself comfortable.

20:44.494 --> 20:46.704
Each game starts one half-hour
behind the other

20:46.704 --> 20:48.206
so that the games
are staggered.

20:48.206 --> 20:51.918
Ms. Lyons, you'll be over at Table Two,
starting in just a few moments.

20:54.462 --> 20:56.589
This is quite the collection
of people.

20:56.589 --> 20:59.592
I see a weapons dealer,
a country singer,

20:59.592 --> 21:02.595
and a chairman of
the Gemeinschaft Bank in Zurich.

21:02.595 --> 21:05.682
What? <i>Forbes</i> was
the only magazine on the flight down here.

21:07.475 --> 21:09.727
There's a Saudi royal over by Table Two.

21:09.727 --> 21:13.731
The two players at Table Three
are both Chinese billionaires.

21:13.731 --> 21:15.858
British SIS has a file
on both of them.

21:15.858 --> 21:18.486
At the same table?
Is it a coincidence?

21:18.486 --> 21:20.321
I don't know.

21:20.321 --> 21:24.409
What does Wujing want here?
What is the Whaler providing him?

21:24.409 --> 21:26.452
I need to sit and play cards.

21:26.452 --> 21:28.037
Where do you want me?

21:28.037 --> 21:30.498
Make yourself useful, honey,
and get us some drinks.

21:34.752 --> 21:38.047
Your brave agents have made it
into the belly of the beast?

21:38.047 --> 21:40.049
<i>They checked in safely
from the casino.</i>

21:40.049 --> 21:42.176
They're off comms for at least
a few hours now.

21:42.176 --> 21:45.722
Agent Malik sitting at the card table
was your idea, I understand?

21:45.722 --> 21:48.057
She's quite something, isn't she?

21:48.057 --> 21:50.184
Listen, Harold, while I have you,

21:50.184 --> 21:52.270
what do you know
about the Ruthermans?

21:52.270 --> 21:53.396
<i>Who?</i>

21:53.396 --> 21:56.607
Phil and Justin Rutherman,
and their one daughter, Amanda.

21:56.607 --> 21:58.192
Is that--

21:59.068 --> 22:01.029
Did you look into the family
of the girl bullying Agnes?

22:01.029 --> 22:02.405
<i>I had a friend</i>

22:02.405 --> 22:04.032
do a little poking around,

22:04.032 --> 22:06.200
and I saw the bullying myself.

22:06.200 --> 22:08.244
- Things are volatile.
<i>- You went to the school?</i>

22:08.244 --> 22:10.121
Do you know how totally
out of bounds that--

22:10.121 --> 22:11.581
<i>Harold, don't be absurd.</i>

22:11.581 --> 22:14.876
I would never
be so conspicuous, let alone creepy,

22:14.876 --> 22:17.128
as to loiter outside of a middle school.

22:17.128 --> 22:19.047
I found her at soccer practice.

22:19.047 --> 22:20.381
I simply thought it prudent

22:20.381 --> 22:22.550
<i>to get ahead of the situation.</i>

22:22.550 --> 22:24.761
Raymond, for once, please listen to me.

22:24.761 --> 22:28.431
Stand down and stop it.
I won't ask you again.

22:30.016 --> 22:32.060
Why am I always the bad guy?

23:20.483 --> 23:22.026
What made this guy stand out?

23:22.026 --> 23:23.611
<i>Something.
In the way he moved.</i>

23:23.611 --> 23:25.696
<i>He was casing the room.
It felt military.</i>

23:25.696 --> 23:27.865
He's not in the game.
This guy isn't right for this place.

23:27.865 --> 23:30.660
You're not kidding.
That guy is Zhang Wei,

23:30.660 --> 23:33.037
former Chinese special forces
turned mercenary,

23:33.037 --> 23:34.997
<i>no longer associated
with their government,</i>

23:34.997 --> 23:38.584
wanted for extrajudicial shootings
in several NATO countries.

23:38.584 --> 23:41.170
He could be recon,
scouting this place for Wujing.

23:41.170 --> 23:42.880
<i>Agent Ressler, you have
a private mercenary</i>

23:42.880 --> 23:44.715
in a room full of potential
targets and the Whaler.

23:44.715 --> 23:47.468
You need to alert Agent Malik
to the threat immediately.

23:47.468 --> 23:49.095
All right. I'm on it.

23:49.095 --> 23:51.514
You're not the only one taking pictures.

23:51.514 --> 23:54.100
I got this lovely one of Ms. Lyons.

23:55.184 --> 23:58.062
I have an NSA-level computer
team at my disposal.

23:58.062 --> 24:00.898
Routine vetting of every
new player at my tables.

24:00.898 --> 24:03.860
Took them a day,
but they busted her alias.

24:03.860 --> 24:05.486
You might've fooled
Mr. Waters in New York,

24:05.486 --> 24:07.405
but you didn't fool me.

24:07.405 --> 24:09.323
So, who are you two?

24:09.323 --> 24:13.452
'Cause she's certainly not Ms. Lyons,
and I'm very interesting in who you are.

24:13.452 --> 24:14.912
Well, I could tell you,

24:14.912 --> 24:17.456
but that would compromise
my partner out there.

24:17.456 --> 24:19.750
Mm. These gentlemen work with me.

24:19.750 --> 24:21.252
They're not affiliated with the casino,

24:21.252 --> 24:25.423
so, if you go with them quietly,
they'll get the answers I need.

24:34.473 --> 24:36.017
I'm Nigel.

24:36.017 --> 24:37.476
I'm in charge here.

24:37.476 --> 24:39.520
Then trust me, Nigel,
you need to let me explain.

24:39.520 --> 24:41.647
Give me my phone
so I can make a call.

24:41.647 --> 24:43.608
Everybody's got an explanation.

24:43.608 --> 24:45.359
An excuse.

24:45.359 --> 24:46.944
We are past that, mate.

24:59.874 --> 25:01.626
Sorry to interrupt your play,

25:01.626 --> 25:04.587
but there seems to be a problem
with your gentleman friend.

25:04.587 --> 25:06.047
He's taken ill, I'm afraid.

25:06.047 --> 25:07.298
Oh, where is he?

25:07.298 --> 25:08.966
Would you like to come with me?

25:19.143 --> 25:20.394
Is there a problem?

25:20.394 --> 25:22.146
Not one that can't be rectified.

25:22.146 --> 25:23.648
They'll take care of you.

25:34.033 --> 25:36.327
This is Mr. Yao Liang.
Please see him to Table Three

25:36.327 --> 25:38.579
and open his line
of credit right away.

25:59.767 --> 26:02.311
We've got real problems, I think.

26:02.311 --> 26:04.146
- I'm aware.
- Bigger than this.

26:04.146 --> 26:06.274
Guess who I just saw
walk in downstairs?

26:07.483 --> 26:09.068
Wujing is here.

26:09.068 --> 26:11.404
That's why the mercenary.
He was recon.

26:11.404 --> 26:12.905
Case the room.

26:12.905 --> 26:14.657
What are they doing here?

26:14.657 --> 26:17.994
Whatever it is, they've done it
at several casinos around the world.

26:18.911 --> 26:22.915
Wujing was using an alias.
Going to sit and play at Table Three.

26:22.915 --> 26:25.209
With the two Chinese billionaires?

26:25.209 --> 26:28.546
You said that MI6
had files on both. Why?

26:28.546 --> 26:31.882
We've got files on thousands
and thousands of people.

26:31.882 --> 26:33.968
Can't remember the exact
details of those two,

26:33.968 --> 26:36.304
but it was probably
Triad association,

26:36.304 --> 26:37.722
or something of the sort.

26:37.722 --> 26:40.224
The Whaler put Wujing
in a room with two

26:40.224 --> 26:43.311
Triad-associated businessmen
and millions on the table, why?

26:45.438 --> 26:49.358
If you two are done whispering,
where did we leave off?

27:14.842 --> 27:16.510
Let's get a few answers.

27:17.678 --> 27:19.847
Well, let me save you the trouble.

27:19.847 --> 27:21.724
I'm an FBI agent here undercover.

27:21.724 --> 27:23.434
She's MI6.

27:23.434 --> 27:25.353
You really don't want to do
what you're about to do.

27:25.353 --> 27:27.438
Sure.

27:27.438 --> 27:30.858
So, uh, which one of you
do I start with?

27:31.108 --> 27:33.778
I guess I'll be your first dance.

27:46.248 --> 27:47.875
Get him up.

28:10.523 --> 28:11.857
Where did you get that?

28:12.400 --> 28:15.486
Us spies have all the best toys.

28:16.487 --> 28:18.197
I keep underestimating you.

28:18.197 --> 28:19.573
Yes, I've noticed that.

28:20.116 --> 28:22.159
Shall we check back in with home?

28:27.456 --> 28:29.125
But you're both all right?

28:29.125 --> 28:31.669
<i>Yeah, might need some dental
work, but yeah, we're okay.</i>

28:31.877 --> 28:33.295
We need to get you out of there.

28:33.295 --> 28:34.964
Not so fast. Wujing is here.

28:34.964 --> 28:36.757
He's on site. Downstairs right now.

28:36.757 --> 28:38.384
Hey, Ressler?

28:38.384 --> 28:40.177
Take a look at this.

28:48.185 --> 28:49.562
I'll be damned.

28:50.396 --> 28:52.231
He is gambling.

28:54.900 --> 28:56.610
That's not what I see.

28:56.610 --> 28:58.195
What do you mean?

28:58.195 --> 29:00.406
One of those billionaires
just folded with two pair.

29:00.406 --> 29:02.950
Lookit, you can see their cards
from this angle.

29:04.076 --> 29:06.120
Why would he fold with that?

29:06.120 --> 29:09.748
Wait. Watch, the other one's
gonna fold now, too.

29:10.875 --> 29:12.501
<i>They're letting Wujing win.</i>

29:12.501 --> 29:14.503
This isn't a game. This is a payday.

29:14.503 --> 29:16.755
You're telling me the men in that game
are losing on purpose?

29:16.755 --> 29:18.716
They must be plants.
That makes sense.

29:18.716 --> 29:20.426
The Whaler set up
the guest list herself.

29:20.426 --> 29:22.970
Wujing needs to fund his war
with Reddington, right?

29:22.970 --> 29:25.431
So, let's assume that he's left
behind a fortune

29:25.431 --> 29:27.516
in Chinese bank accounts
before his arrest.

29:27.516 --> 29:29.810
Old funds from his spy
hunter days?

29:29.810 --> 29:31.562
That was over a decade ago.

29:31.562 --> 29:33.898
<i>Wujing is a criminal and
a fugitive from justice now.</i>

29:33.898 --> 29:36.025
Any bank transaction,
any money transfer,

29:36.025 --> 29:37.693
he has to assume
that the Chinese government,

29:37.693 --> 29:39.653
the US government,
not to mention Reddington

29:39.653 --> 29:41.405
and his network--
they're all watching.

29:41.405 --> 29:43.824
So he needs to get that money
in an untraceable way.

29:43.824 --> 29:45.326
<i>Exactly.</i>

29:45.326 --> 29:47.453
So, Wujing strikes up
a working relationship

29:47.453 --> 29:48.871
with a casino specialist.

29:48.871 --> 29:51.081
He gives her a cut,
and she goes to work

29:51.081 --> 29:53.667
setting up lines of credit
for him under aliases.

29:53.667 --> 29:56.837
Clean money for a dirty
little war against Reddington.

29:58.589 --> 30:00.299
He has up to...

30:00.299 --> 30:02.593
What looks like millions of dollars.

30:02.593 --> 30:03.969
Think about those casinos

30:03.969 --> 30:05.804
they've already hit
in those other cities.

30:05.804 --> 30:07.723
<i>We can't let him walk out
the door with that money.</i>

30:07.723 --> 30:09.558
Well, there's no way
we're getting anywhere back

30:09.558 --> 30:11.936
near that room,
not with all this security.

30:20.819 --> 30:22.613
Harold, what a lovely surprise.

30:22.613 --> 30:24.073
<i>Wujing is in Australia.</i>

30:24.073 --> 30:28.244
He's sitting at a table in a casino
while two Triad money men hand him

30:28.244 --> 30:29.912
millions and millions and millions.

30:29.912 --> 30:32.873
Quite a tidy little scheme,
courtesy of our Whaler.

30:32.873 --> 30:35.084
<i>- She's a clever one.</i>
- Wujing's up millions,

30:35.084 --> 30:36.585
and they're doing it
right out in the open.

30:36.585 --> 30:38.295
The best cons are
always in plain sight.

30:38.295 --> 30:39.880
<i>Ressler and Malik</i>

30:39.880 --> 30:41.715
were ejected from the room
and we can't stop him.

30:41.715 --> 30:43.384
<i>Well, don't worry yourself.</i>

30:43.384 --> 30:45.469
I had an inkling he'd make
an appearance at the game.

30:45.469 --> 30:47.596
- So, I have a backup.
- What backup?

30:47.596 --> 30:50.140
What's sweet and fun
and Red all over?

30:53.352 --> 30:54.728
Hello, there.

30:54.728 --> 30:56.355
My name is Raymond Reddington.

30:56.355 --> 30:59.942
I don't have a seat in this game,
but I'd love to play in.

30:59.942 --> 31:02.403
Mr. Reddington, I'm afraid
all our seats are full.

31:02.403 --> 31:04.738
Mm. Anika, tell me,

31:04.738 --> 31:07.825
how much is your cut
of Wujing's take here tonight?

31:07.825 --> 31:10.619
- Excuse me?
- 10% of his winnings?

31:10.619 --> 31:13.789
No, you're better than that. 15.

31:13.789 --> 31:15.666
I don't know how much
you helped him to collect

31:15.666 --> 31:17.585
at all those other casinos,

31:17.585 --> 31:20.838
but I'm guessing he heads
for the door this evening with,

31:20.838 --> 31:23.299
what, 20, 25 million?

31:23.299 --> 31:26.468
That's a little less
than four to you, yes?

31:27.219 --> 31:29.638
Here's six. In diamonds.

31:30.931 --> 31:32.433
You can take it right now.

31:33.350 --> 31:34.935
I'm a sure bet.

31:41.275 --> 31:44.320
You've never made
a wrong decision in your life.

31:45.487 --> 31:46.780
Don't start now.

31:49.033 --> 31:51.160
I'm sure something
could be arranged.

31:55.164 --> 31:57.875
Pull me up a chair
to the man himself, please.

32:10.095 --> 32:12.640
Anyone mind if I join the fun?

32:12.640 --> 32:16.685
I don't have a great deal of time,
so here's an idea.

32:16.685 --> 32:18.979
What do you say
we play one hand?

32:18.979 --> 32:20.648
Wouldn't that be exciting?

32:20.648 --> 32:23.317
Just you and me. No limit.

32:23.942 --> 32:26.487
I must have millions
and millions here.

32:27.696 --> 32:29.865
This is quite a bold move.

32:29.865 --> 32:33.077
Well, I'm not armed
and you're not armed,

32:33.077 --> 32:34.953
and I highly doubt
we're going to leap

32:34.953 --> 32:36.830
across the table
and do what?

32:36.830 --> 32:38.582
Give each other bloody noses?

32:39.958 --> 32:41.669
Call.

32:41.835 --> 32:43.545
How'd you know I'd be here?

32:44.505 --> 32:46.215
Calculated guess.

32:53.347 --> 32:55.808
And a $5 million bet.

32:57.601 --> 33:00.020
You haven't checked your cards.

33:00.020 --> 33:01.772
They are what they are.

33:03.982 --> 33:07.277
You seem to be a man who takes
an awful lot of risks.

33:07.277 --> 33:09.154
Well, there are risks everywhere.

33:09.154 --> 33:11.615
Although, you've tipped
the odds a bit in your favor

33:11.615 --> 33:15.160
by stocking the game
with your bagmen here.

33:17.454 --> 33:21.792
The irony of Raymond Reddington
making an accusation.

33:21.792 --> 33:25.462
I know exactly what you are.

33:25.462 --> 33:28.924
And soon, the rest of the world
will see that, too.

33:28.924 --> 33:31.719
You have no idea what I am.

33:31.927 --> 33:34.596
You don't even know
how to really look.

33:34.596 --> 33:37.933
Your anger and your hate
have made you shortsighted.

33:44.440 --> 33:47.192
I'm going to be the end of you.

33:48.152 --> 33:49.862
I'm all in.

33:49.862 --> 33:52.239
There's an end waiting
for all of us.

33:53.365 --> 33:55.200
Call.

34:05.127 --> 34:06.837
<i>This is Local Area
Commander Baker.</i>

34:06.837 --> 34:09.089
This is Special Agent Dembe Zuma,

34:09.089 --> 34:12.843
Federal Bureau
of Investigation, badge number 81452.

34:12.843 --> 34:16.472
We have two agents on the premises
of the Crown Rocks Casino.

34:16.472 --> 34:18.056
They've been assaulted, and currently,

34:18.056 --> 34:21.810
there is a wanted fugitive on site
in a private gambling suite.

34:21.810 --> 34:24.271
I suggest you lock down the facility.

34:24.271 --> 34:26.231
We need to get Raymond
out of there.

34:28.066 --> 34:30.110
You think you can what?

34:30.819 --> 34:32.362
Frighten me off?

34:33.655 --> 34:36.408
This is an impressive display of audacity,

34:36.408 --> 34:38.076
you sitting there,

34:38.076 --> 34:41.455
but there isn't a tactic
you have in your arsenal

34:41.455 --> 34:43.415
that will steer me off course.

34:44.249 --> 34:46.335
At the moment, I don't need
anything in my arsenal,

34:46.335 --> 34:48.462
except for the two cards
in front of me.

34:48.462 --> 34:51.256
Then you'd better hope
they're the right ones,

34:51.256 --> 34:53.050
if you plan to take me on.

34:54.259 --> 34:55.636
Three aces.

34:56.762 --> 34:59.014
There's one thing
you should know

34:59.014 --> 35:01.433
before we go any further
than this table.

35:01.433 --> 35:04.520
Whatever they are,
if they're in my hand,

35:04.520 --> 35:06.271
they're always the right cards.

35:07.940 --> 35:09.107
Flush wins.

35:09.107 --> 35:10.859
Aha. Look at that.

35:14.446 --> 35:15.781
This doesn't end here.

35:15.781 --> 35:17.282
I hope not.

35:17.282 --> 35:18.951
But at least we've played a hand.

35:18.951 --> 35:20.744
Ladies and gentlemen, excuse me.

35:20.744 --> 35:22.746
I've just been informed
that the police have entered the casino

35:22.746 --> 35:24.373
and they're heading up here
as we speak.

35:24.373 --> 35:26.416
If everybody can please
just remain calm--

35:29.419 --> 35:31.463
We got to get out of here.

35:35.843 --> 35:37.761
I'll be seeing you.

35:43.433 --> 35:45.519
We need to go.

35:46.270 --> 35:48.438
Lead the way, Agent Malik.

35:58.031 --> 36:01.660
No sign of Wujing or the Whaler
since the game broke up.

36:01.660 --> 36:04.121
Security's checked every inch
of the property.

36:04.121 --> 36:05.497
They're not here.

36:05.497 --> 36:07.165
We should be done here
pretty quick.

36:07.165 --> 36:09.001
We found a bunch of hard drives.

36:09.001 --> 36:12.296
This game she was running with Wujing
was just the tip of the iceberg.

36:12.296 --> 36:14.840
Looks like we have evidence
on dozens of clients.

36:14.840 --> 36:17.968
Laundering, conspiracy,
illegal gambling, fraud.

36:17.968 --> 36:19.761
Wow. Great.

36:21.013 --> 36:23.557
You know,
you saved my ass tonight.

36:23.557 --> 36:25.601
We made a good team.

36:26.184 --> 36:28.020
You can watch my back
in the field any day,

36:28.020 --> 36:31.023
but I still meant what I said before.

36:31.023 --> 36:35.319
About not getting sucked down
the drain of this job?

36:35.319 --> 36:37.029
I didn't know Elizabeth.

36:37.029 --> 36:39.031
I barely knew my mother.

36:41.867 --> 36:43.744
Maybe I'm not like them.

36:46.330 --> 36:47.956
Welcome to the team, Siya.

36:51.084 --> 36:53.003
But I'm still gonna
lose sleep over you.

37:06.141 --> 37:09.102
You know, I don't usually
take meetings like this.

37:09.102 --> 37:10.687
What sort of meetings do you mean?

37:10.687 --> 37:13.231
Ones where I have no idea
what's going on.

37:13.231 --> 37:14.900
Well, I guess I'm just lucky.

37:14.900 --> 37:17.319
You should see me at cards.

37:17.319 --> 37:19.905
You have a project manager
on your team.

37:19.905 --> 37:21.406
Philip Rutherman.

37:21.615 --> 37:26.161
You also have a $78,000 debt
to two bookies in Baltimore.

37:33.126 --> 37:34.544
That's 100.

37:34.544 --> 37:39.091
The extra 20-something's
for whatever you like.

37:39.883 --> 37:42.469
If that's for me, what's for you?

37:42.469 --> 37:46.098
I have it on good authority
that there's an opening

37:46.098 --> 37:49.017
for a project manager
on a site of yours

37:49.017 --> 37:52.688
in Sarasota, Florida,
starting in a couple of weeks.

37:52.688 --> 37:55.774
I think it's time that
Mr. Rutherman and his family

37:55.774 --> 37:58.568
transferred somewhere
a little warmer,

37:58.568 --> 38:01.822
a little wetter,
a little further away.

38:15.043 --> 38:16.628
What's going on?
Why have we stopped?

38:16.628 --> 38:18.547
I'm already late for my flight.

38:18.547 --> 38:20.048
Hello?

38:26.972 --> 38:29.307
You told me we were safe.

38:30.475 --> 38:33.395
You told me you had
thought of everything.

38:33.645 --> 38:35.439
I had.

38:35.439 --> 38:37.691
But you never told me
you were on some path

38:37.691 --> 38:40.944
of assured mutual destruction
with Raymond Reddington of all people.

38:40.944 --> 38:42.696
You held those cards
and you didn't show me,

38:42.696 --> 38:45.198
so I'm not responsible
for what happened in Sydney.

38:46.116 --> 38:47.492
And that?

38:47.492 --> 38:50.245
Was that
Reddington, too?

38:50.996 --> 38:53.790
How much did it cost
for you to betray me?

38:54.833 --> 38:56.877
I'll think of another plan.

38:56.877 --> 38:58.503
We can get back to work.

38:59.671 --> 39:01.923
I have another idea.

39:03.258 --> 39:04.968
Tell me,

39:04.968 --> 39:06.636
how much is in the bag?

39:07.888 --> 39:10.098
Enough to replace what I lost?

39:14.436 --> 39:16.229
I guess it's a start.

39:41.338 --> 39:43.215
- Hello, Harold.
<i>- Authorities in</i>

39:43.215 --> 39:45.467
<i>Australia are still looking
for Anika de Beer.</i>

39:45.467 --> 39:46.885
They won't find her.

39:46.885 --> 39:48.887
Wujing will have disposed
of her by now.

39:48.887 --> 39:51.056
<i>At least he wasn't able
to collect his money.</i>

39:51.056 --> 39:52.557
He'll find another way.

39:52.557 --> 39:53.975
There's always another way.

39:54.768 --> 39:56.394
This is far from over.

39:56.394 --> 39:58.688
<i>So you won't believe this,
but the problem</i>

39:58.688 --> 40:01.983
<i>Agnes was having at school
seems to have rectified itself.</i>

40:01.983 --> 40:04.069
<i>The girl's whole family
just moved to Florida.</i>

40:04.069 --> 40:05.737
That's serendipitous news.

40:05.737 --> 40:07.489
<i>Don't treat me like an idiot, Raymond.</i>

40:07.489 --> 40:09.574
<i>Your fingerprints are visible
from a mile away.</i>

40:09.574 --> 40:12.577
You asked me to stay out of it
and I'm out of it.

40:12.577 --> 40:14.121
If that's the case...

40:15.247 --> 40:17.415
Then what are you doing here?

40:26.591 --> 40:29.177
You know, Maurice Sendak,

40:29.177 --> 40:31.471
one of the most celebrated

40:31.471 --> 40:36.434
and most wonderful children's
book authors of all time,

40:36.434 --> 40:38.395
he said about children--

40:39.146 --> 40:41.231
"You tell them
anything you want.

40:41.231 --> 40:43.191
Just tell them if it's true.

40:43.191 --> 40:44.776
If it's true, you tell them."

40:46.236 --> 40:49.281
I hear that and I think
it's the best advice,

40:50.907 --> 40:53.034
and yet, still...

40:57.664 --> 40:59.624
...what if I want to protect her?

41:01.084 --> 41:02.586
What if I just...

41:05.172 --> 41:11.553
Want her to be
a safe, happy young girl?

41:14.931 --> 41:16.558
I know how much you care.

41:16.558 --> 41:18.143
Truly.

41:18.810 --> 41:21.104
I know you have the best
possible intentions

41:21.104 --> 41:22.856
when it comes to her.

41:22.856 --> 41:26.234
But that also means
allowing her to skin her knees sometimes.

41:27.277 --> 41:29.738
I've raised two children
of my own in my life.

41:30.363 --> 41:34.159
Now I'm raising someone else's,
and I can tell you with certainty,

41:35.202 --> 41:36.703
they grow up to be

41:38.079 --> 41:40.624
whomever they're going to be.
