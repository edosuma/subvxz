00:02.003 --> 00:03.959
Previously on Lost:

00:04.046 --> 00:06.082
- Who is he?
- His name is Richard Alpert.

00:06.174 --> 00:08.415
He's a kind of... advisor.

00:09.969 --> 00:14.429
And he has had that job
for a very, very longtime.

00:14.515 --> 00:17.382
- Why do you want to die?
- I devoted my life,

00:18.269 --> 00:22.433
longer than you can
possibly imagine, in service of a man

00:22.523 --> 00:25.265
who told me that everything
was happening for a reason.

00:25.359 --> 00:28.522
That he had a plan.
A plan that l was a part of.

00:28.613 --> 00:30.274
And now that man's gone. So...

00:30.364 --> 00:34.528
Why do I want to die? Because I just
found out my entire life had no purpose.

01:06.067 --> 01:08.183
I'm here because I need your help.

01:10.488 --> 01:12.228
Will you help me, llana?

01:14.909 --> 01:15.898
Yes.

01:18.079 --> 01:20.320
There's six people
I need you to protect.

01:20.873 --> 01:23.159
I'm gonna give you
a list of their names.

01:23.251 --> 01:25.287
This is what you've been preparing for.

01:27.421 --> 01:29.537
These people... who are they?

01:29.632 --> 01:31.372
They're the remaining candidates.

01:39.767 --> 01:40.927
Candidates?

01:41.018 --> 01:42.428
Candidates for what?

01:42.853 --> 01:44.138
To replace Jacob.

01:46.482 --> 01:48.018
She said I was one of them.

01:49.026 --> 01:51.358
And so are you, and so is Hurley.

01:53.781 --> 01:57.148
Well, that's great.
So, what do we do now?

01:58.536 --> 02:00.822
- I don't know.
- Then who does?

02:04.083 --> 02:06.495
After I've brought them to the Temple...

02:11.465 --> 02:12.716
...what do I do?

02:13.342 --> 02:14.718
Ask Ricardus.

02:15.928 --> 02:17.543
He'll know what to do next.

02:18.639 --> 02:19.754
Who's Ricardus?

02:23.269 --> 02:24.679
He is.

02:26.564 --> 02:28.145
So, Richard...

02:28.232 --> 02:29.563
...what do we do next?

02:35.948 --> 02:37.609
l have no idea what we do next.

02:39.035 --> 02:42.653
You didn't tell your friends that l was
trying to kill myself when you found me?

02:46.208 --> 02:47.709
Does that sound like someone
who has a plan?

02:47.793 --> 02:49.875
Why would Jacob say
you knew what to do if...

02:49.962 --> 02:51.827
Because everything
he ever said is a lie.

02:51.922 --> 02:53.253
What are you talking about?

02:56.427 --> 02:58.008
You wanna know a secret, Jack?

02:58.846 --> 03:00.928
Something I've known a long, long time?

03:07.104 --> 03:08.184
You're dead.

03:11.025 --> 03:13.641
- You mean that figuratively?
- No. I mean, literally.

03:13.736 --> 03:15.852
We're all dead, every single one of us.

03:15.946 --> 03:18.198
And this? This, all this?

03:18.282 --> 03:21.615
It's not what you think it is.
We're not on an island. We never were.

03:24.455 --> 03:25.615
We're in hell.

03:26.791 --> 03:29.123
So I'm not interested
in what Jacob said.

03:29.210 --> 03:32.122
In fact, maybe it's time
we stopped listening to him,

03:32.213 --> 03:34.420
and we started listening
to someone else.

03:34.507 --> 03:36.293
And that's exactly what I'm gonna do.

04:12.128 --> 04:13.243
What are you doing?

04:14.088 --> 04:16.204
- I'm going after Richard.
- Why?

04:16.298 --> 04:19.005
You heard him. He doesn't know
what we need to do next.

04:19.093 --> 04:20.754
He knows.

04:20.845 --> 04:22.881
Jacob told me. He has to know.

04:22.972 --> 04:24.712
Alpert has lost his mind.

04:24.807 --> 04:26.763
He thinks that we're... we're in hell.

04:26.851 --> 04:29.809
If he cared about what Jacob said,
he wouldn't be talking about

04:29.895 --> 04:31.601
listening to someone else.

04:33.524 --> 04:35.264
Wait. You know who he meant?

04:35.359 --> 04:38.692
- This should be interesting.
- What?

04:39.655 --> 04:40.735
He meant Locke.

04:46.328 --> 04:47.864
Locke is dead.

04:47.955 --> 04:51.573
If it's any consolation,
it's not exactly Locke.

05:00.342 --> 05:01.548
Hurley.

05:03.220 --> 05:05.962
- What's he sayin'?
- What's who saying?

05:06.056 --> 05:07.717
Jacob. I saw you talking to him.

05:08.726 --> 05:11.012
- I'm not talking to Jacob.
- Don't lie to me.

05:11.103 --> 05:13.094
If you know anything
that can help us...

05:13.189 --> 05:14.725
It's not Jacob, man.

05:17.067 --> 05:18.443
Then who is it?

05:18.527 --> 05:20.518
Sorry, but this has
nothing to do with you.

05:29.371 --> 05:32.113
- Shephard is right, you know.
- Right about what?

05:32.208 --> 05:35.416
Richard. Going after him
is a waste of time.

05:35.503 --> 05:36.993
He doesn't know anything.

05:39.632 --> 05:40.838
What makes you so sure?

05:40.925 --> 05:43.257
I've known him
since I was 12 years old.

05:43.344 --> 05:44.834
That should count for something.

05:44.929 --> 05:47.796
- So you guys met when you were kids?
- No, Frank, I was a kid.

05:49.433 --> 05:51.674
Richard looked just like he does today.

05:51.769 --> 05:55.182
- You're saying this guy doesn't age?
- That's exactly what I'm saying.

05:56.607 --> 05:58.347
How the hell you think that happened?

10:09.067 --> 10:10.273
No. No, no, no.

11:04.122 --> 11:05.328
lsabeHa.

11:06.291 --> 11:08.247
lsabella. lsabella.

11:18.679 --> 11:20.465
No, no.

11:28.814 --> 11:30.930
No! No!

12:34.671 --> 12:36.582
Amen.

12:54.524 --> 12:55.604
No.

14:27.951 --> 14:30.283
- Is this him?
- Yes.

14:43.633 --> 14:46.591
- You say he speaks English?
- Yes, Mr. Whitfield.

14:52.100 --> 14:53.510
Do you speak English?

14:55.270 --> 14:57.226
| asked, do you speak English?

15:02.152 --> 15:03.688
Take him away and bring me another.

15:05.280 --> 15:07.236
- Hang him.
- Yes, I speak English!

15:07.324 --> 15:09.485
- Yes, I speak English!
- Wait.

15:12.162 --> 15:14.369
You have strong hands.
What sort of work did you do?

15:14.456 --> 15:18.165
| work... | work... in the fields.

15:18.251 --> 15:21.414
I understand you're interested
in going to the New World. Yes?

15:21.505 --> 15:23.541
-Yes.
-We|l, then...

15:23.632 --> 15:26.294
This is your lucky day.
Thank you, Father.

15:27.052 --> 15:29.839
This man is now the property
of Captain Magnus Hanso.

15:32.349 --> 15:33.759
I hope you don't get seasick.

17:29.341 --> 17:30.797
Do you see anything?!

17:34.054 --> 17:37.217
- Bring me the captain.
- Sir, Captain Hanso's dead.

17:38.183 --> 17:40.799
Good God, we're in the middle
of a bloody jungle!

17:49.027 --> 17:51.063
Help! Down here, please!

17:53.907 --> 17:54.896
Down here!

18:14.719 --> 18:16.425
- No!
- No! Stop!

18:16.513 --> 18:17.844
Stop!

18:18.932 --> 18:19.921
No, stop!

18:21.518 --> 18:23.554
- No, no, no. No. No.
- No...

18:23.645 --> 18:25.431
No! Stop!

18:26.273 --> 18:27.479
What are you doing?!

18:35.490 --> 18:38.482
We are shipwrecked
in the middle of the jungle.

18:39.786 --> 18:41.526
We have no fresh water

18:42.122 --> 18:43.532
and limited supplies,

18:44.332 --> 18:46.243
and there are only five officers left.

18:47.043 --> 18:49.375
No! No! No!

18:56.803 --> 18:58.134
Why are you doing this?

18:58.221 --> 18:59.882
Because if I freed you,

19:00.557 --> 19:03.720
it would only be a matter of time
before you tried to kill me.

19:08.106 --> 19:09.266
No!

19:32.422 --> 19:33.832
What happened up there?

19:40.305 --> 19:41.795
I said, report!

19:44.976 --> 19:46.762
No!

24:36.184 --> 24:37.970
No! No!

24:46.819 --> 24:48.104
lsabeHa!

24:49.238 --> 24:50.489
lsabeHa!

25:50.133 --> 25:52.340
Here. Water.

26:12.989 --> 26:14.354
Who...?

26:15.032 --> 26:17.193
Who... who are you?

26:18.453 --> 26:20.660
- A friend.
- I am...

26:22.331 --> 26:23.320
...in hell?

26:24.751 --> 26:26.457
Yes, I'm afraid you are.

26:27.879 --> 26:29.415
You...

26:29.505 --> 26:31.587
You were not on the ship.

26:36.387 --> 26:37.843
l was here...

26:38.514 --> 26:39.924
...long before your ship.

26:40.850 --> 26:43.262
Did... did you see my wife?

26:43.352 --> 26:45.843
- I'm sorry?
- lsabella. My wife.

26:46.355 --> 26:49.017
She was here. She was...

26:49.108 --> 26:53.226
But then... then the black smoke came,

26:53.321 --> 26:54.982
and she ran.

26:56.032 --> 26:57.272
And she hasn't come back?

27:01.829 --> 27:04.366
- That probably means he has her.
- Who?

27:06.542 --> 27:07.702
I think you know who.

27:08.419 --> 27:10.796
If she's alive, I must save her.

27:10.880 --> 27:12.996
- Please. Please, help me.
- Of course.

27:13.090 --> 27:14.591
Of course I'll help.

27:16.177 --> 27:17.713
I want to be free too.

27:19.263 --> 27:20.719
As luck would have it...

27:22.767 --> 27:24.928
...I found these on
one of the officers outside.

27:25.019 --> 27:27.476
I think they'll work.
But before I try,

27:28.105 --> 27:31.438
I need to know that you will help me.

27:31.526 --> 27:32.891
Yes. Yes. Of course.

27:32.985 --> 27:35.317
- You'll do anything I ask?
- Yes. Yes, anything.

27:35.404 --> 27:37.065
Yeah, I promise.

27:37.156 --> 27:38.236
Then we're agreed.

27:59.428 --> 28:01.885
- Thank you.
- Of course, my friend.

28:03.766 --> 28:05.802
It's good to see you
out of those chains.

28:06.727 --> 28:07.978
Thank you.

28:11.107 --> 28:12.938
We're gonna have
to get you on your feet.

28:20.491 --> 28:23.403
You're gonna need your strength
if we're going to escape.

28:23.494 --> 28:24.609
Escape?

28:25.788 --> 28:27.369
That's right.

28:27.456 --> 28:30.072
I'm afraid there's only one way
to escape from hell.

28:30.960 --> 28:32.621
You're going to have to kill the devil.

28:46.309 --> 28:47.924
When you're finished eating,

28:48.769 --> 28:50.179
you'll walk due west.

28:51.272 --> 28:53.058
Once you get to the ocean,

28:53.149 --> 28:54.810
you'll be able to see the statue.

28:56.611 --> 28:58.727
- The statue?
- Your ship smashed through it

28:58.821 --> 29:00.061
on its way inland.

29:00.156 --> 29:03.774
Broke it into pieces.
That's where you'll find the devil.

29:09.790 --> 29:11.451
You'll only have one chance.

29:12.376 --> 29:15.618
Put this through his chest. Do not
hesitate. Do not let him say a word.

29:16.047 --> 29:18.413
If he speaks,
it will already be too late.

29:19.508 --> 29:20.918
He can be very persuasive.

29:22.511 --> 29:25.594
How can I kill him with this?
He is... black smoke.

29:25.681 --> 29:26.887
No.

29:28.017 --> 29:29.348
I am.

29:35.775 --> 29:37.231
My wife, Isabella...

29:38.194 --> 29:39.980
She was running from you?

29:40.071 --> 29:41.732
She was running from him.

29:43.240 --> 29:44.696
I'm sorry.

29:45.326 --> 29:48.033
I saw him take her, but I
couldn't do anything to stop him.

29:50.706 --> 29:52.867
But if you are the black smoke, you...

29:52.959 --> 29:55.496
You aren't the only one
who's lost something, my friend.

29:55.586 --> 29:57.201
The devil betrayed me.

29:58.172 --> 29:59.378
He took my body,

30:00.383 --> 30:01.543
my humanity.

30:02.677 --> 30:05.089
You killed the officers on the ship.

30:05.179 --> 30:07.261
I'm not the one
you need to worry about.

30:07.348 --> 30:09.009
The devil has your wife,

30:09.100 --> 30:11.887
and you are going to have to kill him
if you want to get her back.

30:16.524 --> 30:18.810
Murder is wrong.
That is what brought me here.

30:18.901 --> 30:20.232
My friend...

30:21.570 --> 30:26.280
...you and I can talk all day long
about what's right or wrong.

30:26.367 --> 30:28.904
But the question before you
remains the same.

30:31.914 --> 30:33.825
Do you ever want
to see your wife again?

30:41.424 --> 30:42.960
Yes, I do.

32:13.891 --> 32:15.347
What are you doing here?!

32:16.018 --> 32:18.509
- Who gave you this?!
- Where is my wife?

32:20.272 --> 32:23.105
- What?
- Where is my wife?

32:23.192 --> 32:24.523
I don't know your wife.

32:24.610 --> 32:27.818
- Did she come here on the ship?
- No. She's dead.

32:27.905 --> 32:29.896
Then why are you asking me
where she is?

32:35.704 --> 32:37.865
Did you meet a man in the jungle
dressed in black?

32:40.709 --> 32:41.915
Yes.

32:42.795 --> 32:46.208
- What did he tell you?
- He said you are the devil.

32:48.717 --> 32:51.129
- And?
- He said the only way I would see

32:51.220 --> 32:53.427
my wife again is if! kill you.

32:54.390 --> 32:56.130
I saw her here...

32:56.684 --> 32:59.096
- ...in this place. Where is she?!
- That wasn't your wife.

32:59.186 --> 33:00.221
Yes, it was!

33:00.312 --> 33:03.349
- She is dead, just like me.
- You're not dead.

33:03.440 --> 33:05.897
lam in hell.
I know that I am in hell!

33:05.985 --> 33:08.647
- You really think you're dead?
- Where else would I be?

33:11.657 --> 33:13.898
- All right then.
- What are you doing?

33:15.536 --> 33:16.742
No,no,no,no!

33:24.211 --> 33:26.042
- Still think you're dead?!
- Stop!

33:28.924 --> 33:30.755
Stop!

33:32.928 --> 33:34.338
- Still think you're dead?!
- Stop!

33:35.890 --> 33:37.096
Why should I stop?!

33:37.850 --> 33:38.930
Because I want to live!

33:47.651 --> 33:49.812
That's the first sensible thing
you've said.

33:50.654 --> 33:52.815
- What's your name?
- Ricardo.

33:52.907 --> 33:54.272
Ricardo.

33:55.409 --> 33:56.910
Get up. We need to talk.

34:22.603 --> 34:25.595
- What is inside?
- No one comes in unless I invite them.

34:38.494 --> 34:39.529
Are you the devil?

34:45.834 --> 34:47.085
No.

34:50.130 --> 34:51.415
Then who are you?

34:52.341 --> 34:53.672
My name is Jacob.

34:54.218 --> 34:56.800
I'm the one who brought
your ship to this island.

35:00.683 --> 35:02.173
You brought it here?

35:04.186 --> 35:05.517
Why?

35:16.615 --> 35:19.322
Think of this wine
as what you keep calling "hell."

35:19.410 --> 35:21.651
There's many other names for it too.

35:22.162 --> 35:23.368
"Malevolence."

35:24.206 --> 35:25.491
"Evil."

35:25.582 --> 35:26.742
"Darkness."

35:26.834 --> 35:30.042
And here it is,
swirling around in the bottle,

35:30.129 --> 35:33.838
unable to get out,
because if it did, it would spread.

35:36.760 --> 35:38.045
The cork...

35:38.887 --> 35:40.172
...is this island.

35:41.682 --> 35:44.094
And it's the only thing
keeping the darkness...

35:46.103 --> 35:47.513
...where it belongs.

35:54.737 --> 35:57.979
That man who sent you to kill me
believes that everyone is corruptible

35:58.073 --> 36:00.735
becauseits
in their very nature to sin.

36:01.285 --> 36:03.571
I bring people here to prove him wrong.

36:04.621 --> 36:08.034
And when they get here,
their past doesn't matter.

36:08.876 --> 36:11.458
Before you brought my ship,
there were others?

36:11.545 --> 36:12.751
Yes. Many.

36:12.838 --> 36:14.294
- What happened to them?
- They're all dead.

36:16.133 --> 36:18.089
If you brought them,
why didn't you help them?

36:18.177 --> 36:20.259
Because I wanted them
to help themselves...

36:22.389 --> 36:24.471
To know the difference
between right and wrong

36:24.558 --> 36:26.264
without me having to tell them.

36:26.352 --> 36:30.015
It's all meaningless if! have
to force them to do anything.

36:30.105 --> 36:33.222
- Why should I have to step in?
- If you don't, he will.

36:44.203 --> 36:45.283
Do you want a job?

36:46.288 --> 36:48.153
What? A job?

36:51.502 --> 36:53.117
Doing what?

36:53.212 --> 36:54.577
Well...

36:54.671 --> 36:56.582
...ifl don't want to step in,

36:57.508 --> 36:59.089
maybe you can do it for me.

36:59.843 --> 37:02.425
You can be my...
my representative,

37:02.513 --> 37:04.469
an intermediary between me
and the people

37:04.556 --> 37:07.172
- I bring to the island.
- Well, what will I get in return?

37:07.267 --> 37:09.758
- You tell me.
- I want my wife back.

37:12.648 --> 37:14.184
Can't do that.

37:18.987 --> 37:21.979
Can you absolve me of my sins
so I don't go to hell?

37:22.074 --> 37:23.610
I can't do that either.

37:29.915 --> 37:33.157
Then I never want to die.
I... I want to live forever.

37:35.504 --> 37:36.744
Now that...

37:38.257 --> 37:40.043
...I can do.

38:03.157 --> 38:05.113
You let him talk to you, didn't you?

38:10.372 --> 38:12.078
He told me to give you this.

38:17.754 --> 38:19.790
I'm sure you realize,
if you go with him,

38:19.882 --> 38:21.543
you'll never be with your wife again.

38:25.137 --> 38:26.547
I understand.

38:28.098 --> 38:31.056
He can be very... convincing.

38:34.563 --> 38:36.895
But I want you to know,
if you ever change your mind,

38:36.982 --> 38:38.392
and I mean ever...

38:39.693 --> 38:41.308
...my offer still stands.

38:48.744 --> 38:49.904
l have something for you.

38:54.666 --> 38:56.327
You must have dropped it.

38:57.878 --> 38:59.414
I found it on the ship.

40:32.973 --> 40:34.509
I've changed my mind.

40:40.022 --> 40:41.512
Are you listening to me?

40:42.691 --> 40:44.306
I've changed my mind.

40:50.741 --> 40:51.776
l was wrong!

40:52.659 --> 40:54.365
You said I could change my mind.

40:55.412 --> 40:56.902
You said the offer would stand!

40:59.791 --> 41:01.452
Does the offer still stand?

41:02.878 --> 41:04.869
Does the offer still stand?

41:05.672 --> 41:07.958
Does the offer still stand?

41:22.481 --> 41:23.766
What offer, dude?

41:23.857 --> 41:27.395
What the hell are you doing out here?
Did you follow me?

41:27.486 --> 41:30.478
- Well, kinda.
- Get out! Get out!

41:30.572 --> 41:32.312
- Didn't you hear what I said?
- l was just...

41:32.407 --> 41:34.784
- I told you, I don't know anything!
- Calm down!

41:34.868 --> 41:36.733
- Why did you follow me?!
- Your wife sent me!

41:40.791 --> 41:41.780
What did you say?

41:42.501 --> 41:45.743
I said your wife sent me. lsabella.

41:48.548 --> 41:50.630
She wants to know
why you buried her cross.

41:51.635 --> 41:53.171
How do you know about that?

41:54.429 --> 41:57.796
- Because she just told me.
- What do you mean, just told you?

41:57.891 --> 41:59.927
lsabella saw you dig it up, man.

42:00.769 --> 42:02.384
She's standing right next to you.

42:26.628 --> 42:28.243
I don't see her.

42:31.842 --> 42:33.457
She's right there.

42:34.970 --> 42:36.551
She says your English is awesome.

42:53.488 --> 42:54.898
She wants you to close your eyes.

42:57.951 --> 42:59.737
It's OK. I'll tell you what she says.

44:08.146 --> 44:09.386
Is she gone?

44:11.358 --> 44:12.848
Yeah.

44:31.503 --> 44:32.993
Thank you.

44:34.756 --> 44:36.496
Yeah, you got it.

44:39.010 --> 44:40.125
Is something wrong?

44:42.597 --> 44:44.053
She kinda said one more thing.

44:45.559 --> 44:47.049
Something you have to do.

44:48.019 --> 44:49.008
What?

44:50.480 --> 44:52.596
She said you have to stop
the Man in Black.

44:53.608 --> 44:55.439
You have to stop him
from leaving the island.

44:56.444 --> 44:57.775
'Cause if you don't...

45:44.743 --> 45:46.825
- Good morning.
- Morning.

45:51.291 --> 45:52.497
| see you got my present.

45:55.295 --> 45:57.536
Don't gloat, Jacob.
It doesn't become you.

45:59.674 --> 46:00.880
So you tried to kill me.

46:03.053 --> 46:05.135
- You expect an apology?
- No.

46:06.348 --> 46:09.135
- l'mjust wondering why you did it.
- Because I want to leave.

46:10.352 --> 46:11.842
Just let me leave, Jacob.

46:13.063 --> 46:14.849
As long as I'm alive,
you're not going anywhere.

46:14.940 --> 46:17.101
Well, then now you know
why I want to kill you.

46:17.192 --> 46:19.148
And I will kill you, Jacob.

46:19.527 --> 46:23.236
- Somebody else will take my place.
- Well, then I'll kill them too.

46:29.746 --> 46:30.906
Here.

46:33.291 --> 46:35.031
Something for you to pass the time.

46:40.799 --> 46:42.289
I'll see you around.

46:47.889 --> 46:49.550
Sooner than you think.
