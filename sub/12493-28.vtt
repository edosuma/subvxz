00:03.709 --> 00:05.250
Hey, Dad, you gonna eat
your last piece of bacon?

00:08.542 --> 00:09.542
Nice.

00:09.625 --> 00:12.333
Oh, Dad, by the way
I'm having career day at my school,

00:12.417 --> 00:13.792
and I was wondering if you could come.

00:14.166 --> 00:17.250
Really? You want me to come in
and talk about my job?

00:17.333 --> 00:19.583
- That's fantastic.
- Easy, big guy.

00:19.667 --> 00:21.417
You're a time filler.
Nothing more, nothing less.

00:24.000 --> 00:25.709
That's a little less fantastic.

00:26.959 --> 00:29.625
Hey, how come I never came in
and spoke to one of your classes?

00:30.583 --> 00:34.291
Oh, we didn't have career day back then.
It's a whole new idea.

00:36.792 --> 00:38.917
Really? They had career day
when I was a kid.

00:39.000 --> 00:40.542
Must have skipped a generation.

00:43.166 --> 00:44.333
Hey, Gabe.

00:44.375 --> 00:46.792
Why aren't you asking me
to career day this year?

00:46.875 --> 00:48.458
Because of what happened last year.

00:49.458 --> 00:52.500
We see a lot of interesting things
in the emergency room.

00:52.583 --> 00:55.166
This is what can happen
when you don't follow the directions

00:55.250 --> 00:56.250
on the chainsaw.

00:56.333 --> 00:58.792
Kids, kids,

00:58.875 --> 01:01.208
hold your reactions till the end.
We've got a lot of pictures here.

01:04.333 --> 01:07.500

02:09.875 --> 02:12.583
Candace: and Pepe, his friend
the pepperoni pizza said,

02:13.000 --> 02:15.834
'but, cheesy, that's why kids love you.'

02:16.417 --> 02:18.583
Candace: and cheesy felt all better.

02:19.208 --> 02:20.625
The end."

02:23.250 --> 02:24.125
Mom.

02:26.709 --> 02:29.375
Candace, thank you so much for the story.
We really enjoyed--

02:29.458 --> 02:30.750
I heard you snoring.

02:31.667 --> 02:34.083
The important thing is Charlie liked it.
Right, Charlie?

02:34.166 --> 02:35.250
No, mommy.

02:36.959 --> 02:39.709
- She's right. It was not a good book.
- Yeah.

02:39.792 --> 02:41.417
I mean, I could write
a better story than that.

02:41.500 --> 02:44.417
I wish you would.
I work in children's publishing,

02:44.500 --> 02:47.875
and I am always on the lookout
for new talent.

02:49.166 --> 02:51.375
Anyway, we'll see you guys next week.

02:51.583 --> 02:53.583
- Bye, Candace.
- Bye. See ya.

02:54.166 --> 02:55.875
- Oh, that gives me an idea.
- Me too.

02:55.959 --> 02:57.375
Both: I should write a children's book!

02:58.583 --> 03:01.000
- What do you know about writing?
- What do you know about children?

03:02.083 --> 03:03.917
Well, maybe we could write
a book together.

03:04.000 --> 03:07.250
And then we could read it
at next week's story time.

03:07.625 --> 03:10.458
And the kids will go crazy.
Candace will publish it,

03:10.542 --> 03:12.458
and I'll be on "Good Morning Denver."

03:13.083 --> 03:15.959
Right now let's just focus on writing
a good story for the kids.

03:16.709 --> 03:19.500
You're right. You're right.
It's all about the kids.

03:29.709 --> 03:30.792
Come on.

03:41.125 --> 03:43.500
Oh, great. I guess dinner's here.

03:43.834 --> 03:46.083
And a happy Kwikki Chikki hello to you.

03:47.208 --> 03:49.208
- I heard that, Scott.
- I'm sure that you heard,

03:49.250 --> 03:52.083
but when I ask for a home-cooked meal,
you suddenly go deaf.

03:53.000 --> 03:55.291
I'm not a housewife. I work too.

03:55.375 --> 03:56.625
Do you want me to come back later?

03:56.709 --> 03:58.166
No, then the food will be cold.

03:58.250 --> 03:59.667
Don't worry. It's already cold.

04:00.458 --> 04:02.583
Let's ask this guy. What do you think?

04:03.333 --> 04:06.542
Come on, we want your opinion.
Who is responsible for dinner?

04:07.583 --> 04:08.625
That is a tough question.

04:08.709 --> 04:11.625
I've seen my parents have the very same
argument 'cause they both have jobs too.

04:11.709 --> 04:13.667
- How do they work it out?
- Very loudly.

04:14.792 --> 04:16.750
But at least they're communicating,

04:17.083 --> 04:18.875
which is maybe . what you guys need to do.

04:18.959 --> 04:20.834
But we are communicating.

04:20.917 --> 04:23.375
Are you? Are you really?

04:26.792 --> 04:28.667
No, we're not.

04:29.250 --> 04:30.750
Maybe it's time to start.

04:32.125 --> 04:35.458
I just want things to go back to the way
they were when we first got married.

04:35.542 --> 04:38.083
I want that too. I'm sorry, honey.

04:38.166 --> 04:39.291
I'm sorry too.

04:41.583 --> 04:43.375
Well, I guess there's only
one thing left to say.

04:44.125 --> 04:45.375
That'll be 14.95.

04:55.959 --> 04:57.166
Okay, tell me what you think of this.

04:58.125 --> 05:03.542
"Actress, singer, dancer, comedian,
entertainer, nurse, wife, mother of four,

05:03.625 --> 05:06.959
Amy Duncan now adds author
to her long list of credits."

05:09.625 --> 05:11.917
- What is that?
- It's my bio for the book jacket.

05:13.959 --> 05:18.125
Too long? 'Cause I could lose
"wife and mother of four."

05:20.625 --> 05:21.875
Hey, I have an idea.

05:21.959 --> 05:23.709
Instead of a book jacket,
let's write a book.

05:25.709 --> 05:28.166
Okay, seems kind of backwards to me,
but okay, sure.

05:30.250 --> 05:32.125
Let's just brainstorm
and see what we come up with.

05:32.417 --> 05:33.542
Excellent idea.

05:35.709 --> 05:36.917
Brainstorming.

05:40.208 --> 05:41.792
Stormy brain.

05:44.250 --> 05:47.917
Thinking, thoughts, ideas, words--

05:48.000 --> 05:50.750
Ah, Mom, brainstorms are usually quiet.

05:53.333 --> 05:54.208
Sorry.

05:54.250 --> 05:56.709
And remember,
an idea can come from anywhere.

05:59.542 --> 06:02.166
- Got it!
- What?

06:02.500 --> 06:04.083
Trashy.

06:06.291 --> 06:07.291
Trashy?

06:07.375 --> 06:09.542
Trashy the trash can.

06:11.458 --> 06:14.500
I was staring at the trash can
and it just came to me.

06:15.875 --> 06:18.750
Okay, Trashy.

06:18.834 --> 06:20.417
So, what's his story?

06:20.500 --> 06:23.000
Ahm Teddy, I can't do all the work.
I came up with Trashy.

06:23.500 --> 06:25.583
Yeah, but what's he trying
to teach the kids?

06:26.500 --> 06:28.166
Oh, okay.

06:28.250 --> 06:29.792
Um,

06:30.417 --> 06:34.709
well, when Trashy sees someone litter,

06:34.792 --> 06:37.291
he says, "enh-enh-enh-enh."

06:39.542 --> 06:42.417
I do that really well.
I should do his voice for the movie.

06:44.709 --> 06:46.625
Hey, mom, let's think of some other ideas.

06:46.709 --> 06:47.792
Really?

06:48.166 --> 06:50.500
'Cause I'm loving me some Trashy.

06:51.458 --> 06:54.667
Okay, okay, well,
maybe we should work separately,

06:54.750 --> 06:58.083
then get together tomorrow
with some new ideas

06:58.709 --> 07:00.875
that aren't based off
of the first thing you looked at.

07:03.375 --> 07:04.458
- Fine.
- Good.

07:04.542 --> 07:05.875
- Whatever.
- Great.

07:09.250 --> 07:10.542
Enh-enh-enh.

07:13.417 --> 07:14.917
I can see it on a T-shirt.

07:20.583 --> 07:23.709
Okay, Dad, career day is tomorrow.
What's your plan?

07:24.625 --> 07:25.750
- My plan?
- Yeah.

07:26.166 --> 07:27.291
To wing it.

07:29.250 --> 07:31.959
Dad, this isn't a toast to mom
on your anniversary.

07:32.041 --> 07:34.083
This is important.

07:36.125 --> 07:38.750
Now you can't just get up there
and talk about your job.

07:38.834 --> 07:40.291
You gotta put on a show.

07:40.375 --> 07:42.458
This is all about the sizzle,
not the steak.

07:44.959 --> 07:46.208
I get it.

07:46.542 --> 07:48.625
You want me to bring in
a couple of critters that I caught,

07:48.709 --> 07:50.542
like a rat or a possum.

07:50.625 --> 07:53.625
Uhm, is there any chance you could catch
something exciting,

07:53.709 --> 07:56.792
like an alligator or a lion

07:56.875 --> 08:00.375
or a polar bear? Yeah.

08:03.917 --> 08:07.125
Well, those might be tough
since career day is tomorrow.

08:08.208 --> 08:09.959
And we live in Denver.

08:12.083 --> 08:14.750
All right, Dad, whatever you do,
just don't embarrass me.

08:14.834 --> 08:17.291
That means shirt tucked in
and your most dependable belt.

08:18.750 --> 08:22.041
Hey, that's not gonna happen again.

08:24.667 --> 08:27.166
Man, you ruin one little league game.

08:33.000 --> 08:34.250
Hi again.

08:34.375 --> 08:36.458
Ooh, something smells good.

08:36.917 --> 08:39.667
- I'm making pork chops.
- Then why'd you order chicken?

08:39.750 --> 08:43.333
Actually, we were hoping you could help us
with another problem.

08:44.125 --> 08:47.375
Oh, well, come on out.

08:47.458 --> 08:49.000
Have a seat, make yourselves at home.

08:50.834 --> 08:51.917
Talk to me.

08:52.417 --> 08:53.625
Ah, the thing is...

08:54.000 --> 08:57.792
Christine's mother wants to come
and stay with us for two weeks.

08:59.375 --> 09:02.041
I wanted to ask her
to come for less time, but--

09:03.333 --> 09:04.500
But what?

09:06.125 --> 09:08.125
Come on, tell the chicken guy.

09:09.417 --> 09:12.375
- But I'm afraid of her. There, I said it.
- Yeah, but just because--

09:12.458 --> 09:14.667
Hold on. Hold on.
We're working with Christine now.

09:15.500 --> 09:17.083
Now, Christine,
how did that make you feel?

09:18.083 --> 09:20.375
Well, it makes me feel sad,
and I want Scott--

09:20.458 --> 09:24.333
- Scott, feedback.
- I feel that I'd like to help Christine,

09:24.417 --> 09:27.000
- so she wouldn't be so sad.
- How can you help?

09:27.125 --> 09:30.250
Well-- But you asked me.

09:30.333 --> 09:31.709
Don't question my process.

09:34.125 --> 09:36.166
I'll tell you how you can help.
Date night.

09:36.625 --> 09:37.750
- Date night.
- Yeah,

09:37.834 --> 09:41.125
make sure you guys schedule
some alone time while your mother's here.

09:41.583 --> 09:42.917
Your needs are important too.

09:43.000 --> 09:46.583
- Date night. That's a great idea.
- Yeah. Thank you so much.

09:46.667 --> 09:48.208
Hey, it's what I do.

09:48.542 --> 09:50.041
Now let's take a look at those pork chops.

09:57.333 --> 10:00.000
Now before we share our book ideas,

10:00.417 --> 10:02.542
let's remember to be kind.

10:02.875 --> 10:06.041
That's right. There are no bad ideas.

10:06.959 --> 10:08.083
I'll go first.

10:10.083 --> 10:12.166
Ba-bam!

10:14.333 --> 10:17.000
Hey, Trashy's back.

10:17.959 --> 10:19.750
I know.

10:19.834 --> 10:22.375
Try as I might, I could not top him.

10:24.542 --> 10:26.041
Can I share one of my ideas now?

10:26.875 --> 10:28.375
Yeah, of course. Go ahead.

10:28.458 --> 10:30.000
Okay.

10:30.834 --> 10:32.500
So my idea

10:32.583 --> 10:36.500
is a story about a little tin can
and his name is...

10:37.333 --> 10:39.208
"Tim Can."

10:41.542 --> 10:45.125
So the story begins with Tim on the shelf
at the store.

10:45.208 --> 10:46.959
Then he goes on some amazing adventures

10:47.041 --> 10:49.959
that teach kids all about recycling.
What do you think?

10:51.125 --> 10:54.166
I think I was wrong. There are bad ideas.

10:56.750 --> 11:00.125
Honey, don't get too down on yourself.
I set the bar pretty high with Trashy.

11:01.208 --> 11:04.667
Are you kidding?
You just-- You pointed at a trash can

11:04.750 --> 11:07.208
and gave it a stupid name.
I could do that.

11:07.291 --> 11:10.959
Let's write a story about Tabley
or Blendery.

11:11.041 --> 11:13.875
Blendery? Okay, that's just silly.

11:13.959 --> 11:15.667
What would a blender say?
"Chop, chop, chop"?

11:17.041 --> 11:18.250
Even I can't make that work.

11:20.709 --> 11:22.959
You know what doesn't work? This.

11:23.500 --> 11:25.750
You know what you are, jealous.

11:25.834 --> 11:28.250
- Oh, yes, I am,
- Mmm.

11:28.333 --> 11:29.875
of people that don't have to work
with you.

11:30.500 --> 11:33.458
Then fine. Don't work with me.
I'll write "Trashy" by myself.

11:33.542 --> 11:35.792
Okay, well, I'll write
"Tim Can" by myself,

11:35.875 --> 11:37.500
then next week at story time,

11:37.583 --> 11:39.125
we'll let the kids decide
which one's best.

11:39.208 --> 11:42.750
Oh, yeah, yeah. They'll decide,
to feed your book to Trashy!

11:52.000 --> 11:54.500
When mommy finishes reading her book
at story time,

11:54.583 --> 11:57.959
I want you to jump up
and yell, "Yay, Trashy!"

11:58.041 --> 11:59.959
- Can you do that for me?
- Yay, Trashy!

12:00.041 --> 12:01.125
Yay!

12:01.500 --> 12:04.125
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

12:04.208 --> 12:07.041
You're coaching Charlie.
Mom, that's cheating.

12:07.125 --> 12:08.500
I am her mother.

12:08.583 --> 12:10.959
It is my job to tell her
what stuff to like.

12:11.667 --> 12:15.125
Okay, so Trashy's the right stuff?
Enh-enh-enh.

12:16.959 --> 12:18.458
Even though you're mocking me,

12:19.125 --> 12:20.291
it still works.

12:25.250 --> 12:28.083
Okay, Charlie, now repeat after me,

12:28.166 --> 12:30.417
"Tim Can, I love Tim Can."

12:30.458 --> 12:32.000
Yay, Trashy!

12:32.083 --> 12:33.250
Gahhh!

12:42.667 --> 12:44.792
Guys, what are you doing here?

12:44.875 --> 12:47.875
- This is my mother Elaine.
- We need you.

12:49.625 --> 12:52.083
We tried ordering chicken,
but they said you weren't working today.

12:53.625 --> 12:57.500
Well, I guess I could fit you in.

12:58.041 --> 12:58.959
Have a seat.

12:59.041 --> 13:00.750
Okay, talk to me.

13:01.291 --> 13:05.125
I didn't come halfway across this country
so these two could go out on a date night.

13:05.208 --> 13:06.917
Then feel free to go back.

13:07.667 --> 13:09.125
Scott, that is my mother.

13:09.208 --> 13:10.917
Okay, okay, I see what's going on here.

13:11.000 --> 13:13.500
You guys are talking at each other,
not with each other.

13:13.583 --> 13:15.792
Now you talk to me, and I'll talk to him.

13:15.875 --> 13:18.250
And he'll talk to me and I'll talk to her.

13:18.333 --> 13:20.458
She'll talk to me, and I'll talk to you.

13:21.125 --> 13:24.750
That's you to me, me to him, him to me,
me to her, her to me, me to you.

13:24.834 --> 13:25.792
It's just that simple.

13:27.166 --> 13:29.625
It's kind of hard to take you seriously
without the hat.

13:29.709 --> 13:31.083
Oh, sorry.

13:32.166 --> 13:33.750
Ah! Let's get to work.

13:35.125 --> 13:38.166
I was just afraid of losing you.

13:40.291 --> 13:41.875
You'll never lose me.

13:43.542 --> 13:46.500
And you can stay here
as long as you like, Mom.

13:50.917 --> 13:52.500
What's going on in here?

13:53.250 --> 13:56.208
Healing.
What's going on in here is healing.

13:56.291 --> 13:58.250
Elaine:

14:01.792 --> 14:04.750
Thank you, Mr. Turtlebaum. Oh.

14:05.125 --> 14:09.917
Of "Turtlebaumb and Turtlebaum Accounting,
a Professional Corporation."

14:11.041 --> 14:15.625
Right. Now let's give a warm
Room 6 welcome to my dad, Bob Duncan.

14:16.375 --> 14:18.667
- Hey.
- Dazzle me.

14:20.792 --> 14:25.041
Hey, everybody, I am Bob Duncan
of Bob's Bugs Be Gone.

14:25.125 --> 14:27.208
And I am here today

14:27.583 --> 14:31.583
to talk to you
about the fine art of pest control.

14:33.417 --> 14:39.583
Yes. Now in my typical day,
I come across all sorts of insects--

14:39.667 --> 14:42.250
Ants, roaches, mice.

14:46.250 --> 14:48.458
"Wait, Mr. Duncan," you say,

14:48.542 --> 14:51.166
"mice aren't insects. They are..."

14:54.000 --> 14:55.000
Anybody?

14:56.208 --> 14:58.542
That's right. They are rodents.

14:58.959 --> 15:00.250
Not here to learn.

15:01.792 --> 15:05.208
Anyway, I've brought along some animals

15:05.291 --> 15:07.417
that, although I've never seen them
on the job,

15:07.500 --> 15:09.125
I could quite possibly catch if...

15:09.750 --> 15:14.542
we were living in a different climate
on a different continent.

15:15.208 --> 15:17.625
For example...

15:19.834 --> 15:21.208
-Bob: Look at that guy.
- Kids: Ooh!

15:21.291 --> 15:23.875
Bob: That is an emperor scorpion.

15:24.166 --> 15:27.583
Now some people say
that its sting is no worse than a bee's,

15:27.667 --> 15:30.709
and others, well, they're not around
to say anything.

15:30.792 --> 15:33.208
Ow!

15:34.750 --> 15:36.834
I'm just kidding.

15:36.917 --> 15:38.291
I'm just kidding.

15:38.375 --> 15:40.959
Hey, you thought that was cool, huh?

15:41.333 --> 15:43.875
Wait until you check out this guy.

15:47.667 --> 15:49.542
Whoa.

15:49.792 --> 15:53.667
Look at him, huh? This is a corn snake.

15:53.750 --> 15:56.291
Pretty cool, huh? That's my Dad.

16:01.166 --> 16:03.959
Hello, everybody, welcome to story time.

16:04.041 --> 16:06.250
My name is Teddy,
and today we have a special treat.

16:06.333 --> 16:07.709
You're gonna hear two stories.

16:07.792 --> 16:10.417
The first one is written by me,
and it's called,

16:10.500 --> 16:13.000
"Tim Can and his amazing journey."

16:13.333 --> 16:17.250
- Tin can?
- Tim. Tim Can.

16:19.250 --> 16:22.333
All right, now before
we begin, just a reminder, as of today,

16:22.417 --> 16:25.375
this story has not been published.

16:27.166 --> 16:29.750
Okay. "Once upon a time,

16:29.834 --> 16:32.625
there was a little can of soup
and his name was Tim.

16:33.000 --> 16:37.000
Tim lived at the grocery store
hoping someday someone would buy him.

16:37.083 --> 16:40.583
One day a nice woman did.
Her name was Candace."

16:42.667 --> 16:45.208
Oh! Hey! That's your name.

16:47.041 --> 16:49.500
That's funny. Okay.

16:49.583 --> 16:52.583
"Candace took Tim home,
poured his soup in a pot,

16:52.667 --> 16:54.542
then tossed him in the recycling bin.

16:54.625 --> 16:57.667
Tim was sad.
'Is that all there is?' He wondered."

16:58.208 --> 16:59.917
That's what I'm wondering.

17:06.375 --> 17:09.166
Poor plumber, having to follow me.

17:09.750 --> 17:11.917
I guess somebody had to go on
after Elvis, right?

17:12.000 --> 17:13.166
Both:

17:13.959 --> 17:16.458
You did great, Dad, and more importantly,

17:16.542 --> 17:17.917
- so did your belt.
- Yeah.

17:18.375 --> 17:20.000
Gabe, your old man
wasn't gonna let you down.

17:26.542 --> 17:27.583
Have you seen the scorpion?

17:27.917 --> 17:31.083
- What? You lost a scorp--
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.

17:31.166 --> 17:33.917
Let's just find it quietly by ourselves.

17:34.875 --> 17:37.166
All right.
Scorpions aren't poisonous, right?

17:37.250 --> 17:39.583
How should I know?
I just rented it this morning.

17:41.166 --> 17:43.917
I thought I saw something on TV
that said a scorpion can paralyze you.

17:44.500 --> 17:48.166
That might have been a nice thing
to mention before I let it walk on me.

17:48.500 --> 17:50.834
All:

17:51.250 --> 17:52.417
I think they found it.

17:54.208 --> 17:56.834
"And after Tim had been recycled
into Tim pie plate

17:56.917 --> 17:58.083
and Tim aluminum foil,

17:59.083 --> 18:04.291
he went back to being Tim Can
and lived happily ever after. The end."

18:04.417 --> 18:05.834
- Children:
- Teddy: Yay!

18:06.375 --> 18:09.375
Well, kids, wasn't that better
than "Cheesy and Pepe pizza"?

18:09.375 --> 18:11.250
Kids: Yeah!

18:11.333 --> 18:13.333
Amy: Hey, kids, here comes Trashy!

18:16.917 --> 18:20.625
Hey, everybody, I'm Trashy the trash can.

18:22.417 --> 18:23.959
But I'm not just any trash can.

18:24.083 --> 18:27.917
No, I'm a trash can that gives out candy.
Whoo!

18:29.667 --> 18:32.875
And the best part about Trashy
is that he has magical powers

18:32.959 --> 18:35.250
so that he never runs out of candy.

18:35.333 --> 18:37.333
Yeah, eat it up. Yeah, eat it up.

18:37.417 --> 18:40.500
And that's the story
of Trashy the trash can. The end.

18:41.709 --> 18:42.750
That's not a story.

18:42.834 --> 18:45.417
You're just throwing candy at the kids
so they'll like your book better.

18:45.458 --> 18:48.625
Well, let's see if it works.
Who likes Trashy better than Tim Can?

18:48.709 --> 18:50.375
- Me!
- Amy: Ooh, ooh, ooh! Yeah, yeah!

18:50.375 --> 18:52.000
- Amy: Mm-hmm.
- Oh, yeah?

18:52.125 --> 18:54.834
Well, I forgot to tell you
one thing about Tim Can.

18:55.583 --> 18:58.250
He is gonna take all
of you kids in the library

18:58.333 --> 18:59.709
out for ice cream.

19:02.125 --> 19:03.792
Okay, everybody repeat after me.

19:03.875 --> 19:05.583
Trashy! Trashy!

19:05.667 --> 19:08.750
- Tim Can! Tim Can! Tim Can!
- Trashy! Trashy! Trashy!

19:08.834 --> 19:12.000
- Oh, Candace, do you wanna buy my story?
- Or do you wanna buy my story?

19:12.417 --> 19:15.625
What I want is to find a new library
for story time.

19:18.542 --> 19:22.458
Great. What am I supposed to do
with 500 of these?

19:30.959 --> 19:32.375
And what seems to be the problem tonight?

19:32.375 --> 19:34.834
Oh, there's no problem.
Everything's great.

19:34.917 --> 19:36.500
Aren't we past this? Let's dive in.

19:37.250 --> 19:40.709
No, seriously, we're fine.
We worked out all our issues.

19:41.166 --> 19:42.250
Then why'd you order chicken?

19:42.709 --> 19:43.917
Because we're hungry.

19:46.166 --> 19:48.125
But if you guys are fine, then...

19:49.375 --> 19:50.583
I'm just the chicken guy.

19:51.333 --> 19:52.333
Pretty much.

19:53.417 --> 19:54.458
Thanks.

19:57.542 --> 19:58.834
Keep the change.

20:02.333 --> 20:03.917
Oh, I'll be back!

20:05.333 --> 20:06.542
I forgot your sides.

20:14.375 --> 20:15.250
Gabe.

20:16.208 --> 20:18.208
Can I talk to you for a minute?

20:18.250 --> 20:20.875
- Kinda busy with my string cheese.
- Bob:

20:22.458 --> 20:25.250
Buddy, I'm really sorry about today.

20:26.875 --> 20:28.792
All you asked me to do
was not embarrass you.

20:28.875 --> 20:30.250
And that's exactly what I did.

20:30.875 --> 20:34.709
Dad, you didn't embarrass me.
Thanks to you, everybody loves me.

20:35.417 --> 20:36.417
What?

20:37.125 --> 20:40.625
Yeah, after the scorpion stung you,
and then you passed out,

20:40.709 --> 20:42.792
and then Mr. Turtlebaum tried
to suck the poison out of you

20:42.875 --> 20:44.291
and then he passed out.

20:44.375 --> 20:46.000
Gabe:

20:46.792 --> 20:47.792
What?

20:49.083 --> 20:52.000
In all the confusion, the snake got loose.

20:52.083 --> 20:54.291
Yeah, backup. Turtlebaum did what?

20:56.125 --> 20:58.959
And then while you were at the hospital,
the fire department came

20:59.083 --> 21:01.250
and the whole school was evacuated
for the day.

21:02.000 --> 21:03.625
I am a hero because of you.

21:05.709 --> 21:06.792
Thanks, Dad.

21:09.125 --> 21:11.625
Now I'm gonna need an answer
on that Turtlebaum question.

21:16.458 --> 21:20.125
Well, Charlie, needless to say,
I'm still unpublished,

21:20.208 --> 21:23.333
but the good news is so is Mom.

21:25.959 --> 21:27.959
I think we learned
a very important lesson.

21:29.208 --> 21:31.458
I look good even in a trash can.

21:34.125 --> 21:36.542
Well, that's one of the lessons.

21:36.834 --> 21:38.667
- So--
- I just feel so empty,

21:39.500 --> 21:40.834
so abandoned.

21:43.000 --> 21:46.250
I guess it'd be safe to say I feel used.

21:48.375 --> 21:49.625
You know what I'm saying?

21:54.250 --> 21:56.792
Teddy: PJ, the poor kid's
been here for 10 minutes.

21:56.875 --> 21:58.041
Pay him already.

22:01.583 --> 22:03.625
Hey, see you tomorrow?

22:07.667 --> 22:11.000
Sometimes there's nothing
left to say but good luck, Charlie.

22:16.333 --> 22:17.750
Poor me.

22:18.083 --> 22:21.834
I don't have any toppings, just cheese.

22:21.917 --> 22:24.375
You're a loser, cheesy.

22:24.458 --> 22:27.417
Look at me, all covered in pepperoni.

22:27.959 --> 22:31.125
There must be something good
about being so plain.

22:31.208 --> 22:33.834
Oh yeah, when you think of it,
let me know.

22:35.333 --> 22:36.333
Uh-oh.

22:36.417 --> 22:39.750
Haaa, plain old cheese
or delicious pepperoni?

22:39.875 --> 22:43.458
No!

22:44.333 --> 22:48.542
Huh, I guess there is something good
about being plain.

22:52.625 --> 22:55.458
- It'd be a shame to leave just one.
- I was afraid of that.
