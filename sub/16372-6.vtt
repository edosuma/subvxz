00:03.680 --> 00:06.275
<i>The president of the United States
is not God, gentlemen.</i>

00:06.520 --> 00:08.989
His judgment is not final.

00:09.360 --> 00:12.239
He has judged you
to be human-rights violators...

00:12.440 --> 00:15.080
...drug traffickers,
impediments to democracy...

00:15.280 --> 00:18.751
...and he has signed
executive order 13405...

00:18.960 --> 00:22.556
...freezing 760 million euros
of your money.

00:22.760 --> 00:25.195
My judgment is that
you are sanctioned businessmen...

00:25.360 --> 00:28.159
...with no cash
to run your business, so...

00:30.520 --> 00:33.319
...six hundred million euros...

00:33.520 --> 00:36.035
...secured on a tarmac in a plane...

00:36.200 --> 00:38.112
...less than 14 kilometers
from this room.

00:38.320 --> 00:39.754
Your money, gentlemen...

00:39.960 --> 00:41.792
...to do with as you please.

00:42.000 --> 00:43.753
Infrastructure, weapons...

00:43.960 --> 00:47.431
...medicine, sex, drugs, rock 'n' roll.

00:47.600 --> 00:50.035
It matters not to me.
All I ask in return...

00:50.240 --> 00:53.278
...is a market rate on the loan
until your assets are unfrozen...

00:53.440 --> 00:56.239
...at which point
you will transfer them to me.

00:56.400 --> 01:01.429
You offer 600 and expect 760
when sanctions are lifted.

01:01.600 --> 01:04.434
Yes, 160 million...

01:04.599 --> 01:08.560
...plus interest for substituting
my judgment for the president's.

01:09.080 --> 01:10.434
You can keep the plane.

01:41.720 --> 01:44.633
I have three quarters of a billion
in cash parked at MSQ.

01:44.840 --> 01:46.399
If you let me go now, it's yours.

01:46.560 --> 01:47.630
Do you, now?

01:47.800 --> 01:51.680
My team seized that after you
cut the feed to the conference room.

01:51.920 --> 01:53.400
Can we keep the plane?

02:02.080 --> 02:04.436
Hello, Oscar.
I trust you secured the package.

02:04.640 --> 02:05.676
And his cargo.

02:05.840 --> 02:08.309
Shall I deduct the balance of my fee
from the cash at hand?

02:08.520 --> 02:11.592
Yes, and direct a generous contribution
in Le Bron's name...

02:11.760 --> 02:13.353
...to the Belarusian Refugee Fund.

02:13.800 --> 02:15.792
<i>- All of it?
- Don't be absurd.</i>

02:16.000 --> 02:18.595
Oh, and Oscar, that plane...

02:18.800 --> 02:20.473
...is mine.

02:31.360 --> 02:34.432
Iranian mullahs, Mexican cartels...

02:34.600 --> 02:35.829
...radical despots.

02:36.000 --> 02:38.037
Your government
declares them enemies...

02:38.240 --> 02:41.233
...and freezes their assets
to influence their behavior.

02:41.440 --> 02:44.592
Economic sanctions
are relatively easy to implement...

02:44.760 --> 02:47.559
...and historically effective, until now.

02:47.760 --> 02:50.912
Agent Navabi, would you be so kind?

02:52.120 --> 02:53.520
RenÃ© Le Bron...

02:53.720 --> 02:57.270
...financier of terrorist states
and criminal organizations.

02:57.440 --> 02:59.830
When your government
freezes their assets...

03:00.040 --> 03:02.953
...Le Bron offers them sizable loans...

03:03.200 --> 03:05.476
...rendering the sanctions toothless...

03:05.680 --> 03:08.195
...and affording the bad actors
the ability...

03:08.360 --> 03:11.319
...to continue
conducting business as usual.

03:11.520 --> 03:14.354
When the sanctions are lifted,
Le Bron makes a hefty profit...

03:14.520 --> 03:16.432
...by pocketing the frozen assets...

03:16.600 --> 03:19.559
...he insisted his borrowers
put up as collateral.

03:19.760 --> 03:22.320
Brilliant idea. Sick, but brilliant.

03:22.520 --> 03:23.556
Yes, Donald.

03:23.800 --> 03:26.031
Truth be told, I'm disappointed
I didn't think of it.

03:26.200 --> 03:28.510
Why bother
when you can have us arrest him...

03:28.720 --> 03:29.790
...and take his place?

03:30.000 --> 03:32.037
- Good point.
- Sorry, did I miss something?

03:32.200 --> 03:35.750
- Is this about going after Kirk and...?
- Finding my daughter? No. It isn't.

03:35.920 --> 03:38.640
Apparently, empire-building
takes precedence.

03:38.800 --> 03:41.395
Alexander Kirk is a client of Le Bron's.

03:41.600 --> 03:45.719
After your government froze Kirk's
assets, he turned to Le Bron for a loan.

03:45.880 --> 03:48.759
You always give us someone
six degrees of separation from Kirk.

03:48.920 --> 03:51.833
I intercepted Le Bron
in Minsk closing a deal.

03:52.040 --> 03:56.956
He's willing to cooperate, but on
a condition I am powerless to fulfill:

03:57.160 --> 03:59.152
immunity from prosecution.

03:59.320 --> 04:03.030
So, you think that he'll cooperate
in exchange for witness protection?

04:03.240 --> 04:07.712
One can hardly expect unconditional
virtue from creatures like RenÃ© Le Bron.

04:07.880 --> 04:09.553
So I've learned.

04:11.960 --> 04:14.555
I'll have to clear immunity
with Cynthia Panabaker.

04:14.720 --> 04:18.475
Ressler, Navabi, Aram, clear
the logistics for transfer of custody.

04:18.680 --> 04:20.911
Keen, a word?

04:26.760 --> 04:29.753
I can't pretend to know
the stress you're under.

04:30.240 --> 04:32.550
He's doing everything in his power
to find Agnes.

04:32.720 --> 04:34.279
And kill Kirk.

04:34.480 --> 04:38.554
- You have a problem with that?
- Alexander Kirk is my father.

04:39.000 --> 04:40.480
- You have proof?
- Yes.

04:40.680 --> 04:42.478
DNA evidence
of who my father is...

04:42.640 --> 04:44.950
...and who's been lying to me
for three years.

04:45.120 --> 04:47.999
I don't know how you bear it,
but we have a job to do...

04:48.160 --> 04:49.992
...and we can't do it
without Reddington.

04:50.160 --> 04:51.355
I'll do my job...

04:51.560 --> 04:53.916
...but I am done cozying up
to that snake.

05:02.840 --> 05:05.400
- Tough morning.
- Here.

05:06.600 --> 05:08.239
This should lift the mood.

05:08.440 --> 05:12.719
I've got some leftover lemon chicken.

05:12.920 --> 05:16.118
Ho Kow crispy beef.

05:16.280 --> 05:19.193
- You're gonna have it for lunch.
- Thanks, but I'm good.

05:19.400 --> 05:20.754
I've also got Paco's Tacos.

05:21.360 --> 05:22.396
She went all out.

05:22.600 --> 05:24.000
It's why I'm late.

05:25.120 --> 05:26.395
Wait, how'd you know?

05:26.560 --> 05:28.995
Obviously, no one
would buy all that for themselves.

05:29.200 --> 05:31.351
She clearly wants
to make a good impression.

05:31.600 --> 05:33.034
Yeah. Yeah, I guess.

05:33.200 --> 05:34.873
- Is that a problem?
- No.

05:36.200 --> 05:38.157
She's beautiful and smart.

05:38.680 --> 05:40.478
She's an 11. I mean, I'm a six.

05:40.680 --> 05:41.750
Four on most days.

05:41.960 --> 05:46.159
Don't get me wrong,
I am going to enjoy it, but...

05:46.760 --> 05:48.592
...something is up.

05:48.800 --> 05:50.280
Maybe I'm her rebound guy...

05:50.600 --> 05:52.876
...or she's got
three months to live, or...

05:53.360 --> 05:58.037
Or maybe she thinks you're a handsome,
smart, incredibly nice guy...

05:58.200 --> 05:59.759
- ...who's easy to be around?
- Really?

06:00.000 --> 06:01.150
You think so?

06:01.560 --> 06:03.711
No. But she might.

06:05.280 --> 06:06.760
Cynthia Panabaker.

06:06.920 --> 06:08.115
<i>Harold.</i>

06:08.320 --> 06:10.152
Tell me you can
sit in for poker night.

06:10.360 --> 06:12.955
I simply cannot afford
another empty chair.

06:13.160 --> 06:14.594
<i>Still on, as far as I know.</i>

06:14.800 --> 06:16.837
<i>Got news.
Major break in the Kirk case...</i>

06:17.040 --> 06:18.520
<i>...but I need immunity
for the informant.</i>

06:18.680 --> 06:21.036
<i>- Name?
- RenÃ© Le Bron.</i>

06:24.320 --> 06:25.515
<i>Yes? What is it?</i>

06:25.680 --> 06:27.956
Yeah, we got a problem.

06:32.320 --> 06:34.835
I just received confirmation
from the farm.

06:35.080 --> 06:37.231
Reddington was behind
the Le Bron abduction.

06:37.440 --> 06:39.318
If the FBI manages to turn him...

06:39.520 --> 06:43.355
...they can track and seize
all of your remaining assets.

06:43.520 --> 06:44.556
Shall I deal with it?

06:44.800 --> 06:47.759
I've already acquired
the details of his transport.

06:47.920 --> 06:50.480
Yes. Anything else?

06:50.720 --> 06:54.396
It appears the seeds of doubt
you sowed in Masha...

06:54.600 --> 06:56.796
...have taken root.

07:01.920 --> 07:03.400
It's time to reach out.

07:03.600 --> 07:07.514
- Take adequate precautions.
- Adequate precautions?

07:07.680 --> 07:10.559
She's a key consultant
for the FBI.

07:10.760 --> 07:13.559
Yes, and she's my daughter.

08:33.799 --> 08:35.029
Get down!

08:35.320 --> 08:36.754
<i>- Yes?
- We lost the asset.</i>

08:36.960 --> 08:38.313
Single shot, fatal.

08:38.480 --> 08:40.119
The shooter gave us the slip.

08:40.280 --> 08:42.111
Thank you, Harold.

08:42.799 --> 08:44.234
Le Bron is dead...

08:44.440 --> 08:46.591
...right on schedule.

08:47.320 --> 08:50.472
Time to send out the invitations.

09:05.760 --> 09:07.240
Good morning.

09:07.720 --> 09:09.234
How long were you staring at me?

09:09.480 --> 09:11.153
All night.

09:39.200 --> 09:40.998
Nick's Pizza.

10:00.880 --> 10:01.916
Welcome.

10:02.160 --> 10:04.197
Hi. Okay, so...

10:04.400 --> 10:06.676
...electronics,
all electronics, phones.

10:06.880 --> 10:08.792
It's like airport security.
One at a time.

10:09.040 --> 10:10.520
Put your arms up for me.

10:13.240 --> 10:14.276
Okay, next.

10:15.640 --> 10:17.199
You're good. Thank you.

10:17.400 --> 10:19.437
Just close the door behind you, sir.

10:21.080 --> 10:22.480
Next.

10:25.880 --> 10:27.678
Welcome to the past.

10:28.240 --> 10:30.118
This space is impregnable...

10:30.280 --> 10:33.512
...to every frequency
of wireless transmission...

10:33.720 --> 10:34.870
...including microwaves.

10:35.040 --> 10:37.794
Every piece of equipment
you see is analogue.

10:38.440 --> 10:41.638
Our sole concession
to the digital revolution...

10:41.840 --> 10:45.072
<i>...is a Ms. Pac-Man machine
in the break room.</i>

10:45.240 --> 10:46.276
But why?

10:46.440 --> 10:49.877
<i>- Because I like Ms. Pac-Man.
- No, why this museum?</i>

10:50.080 --> 10:52.072
- We've been breached.
- Wait a minute.

10:53.000 --> 10:55.356
- You two have been working together?
- Yes.

10:55.560 --> 10:58.234
Our public disagreement
was staged for Kirk's benefit.

10:58.440 --> 11:00.159
- He's got a tap into the Post Office?
- I know it.

11:00.360 --> 11:04.240
- Le Bron's death was proof.
- You sicced us on Le Bron as a test.

11:04.440 --> 11:08.150
You knew if Kirk was listening
and knew we were going after Le Bron...

11:08.320 --> 11:10.676
- ...he'd try to get to him.
- We set the bait, he took it.

11:10.880 --> 11:13.793
- Human sacrifice.
- I prefer the term "tethered goat."

11:13.960 --> 11:15.952
Besides, Harold,
the man was a degenerate...

11:16.120 --> 11:19.670
...and his death denies pariah states
access to ready cash...

11:19.880 --> 11:21.792
...putting teeth back in the sanctions...

11:22.000 --> 11:24.037
...your country imposes
with such tumescence.

11:24.240 --> 11:26.277
So we have a mole. Who?

11:26.480 --> 11:28.756
Not who. What.

11:29.640 --> 11:31.996
Our system. It's been hacked.

11:32.160 --> 11:33.514
Impossible.

11:33.680 --> 11:37.435
We've got more firewalls
than the NSA's Utah data center...

11:37.640 --> 11:40.075
...and I personally turn it inside out
every morning.

11:40.240 --> 11:43.995
It is a bit-banger's nightmare.
Unhackable.

11:44.200 --> 11:46.396
Which tells us exactly
who the culprits are.

11:46.600 --> 11:49.593
The Thrushes,
a crew that hacks the unhackable.

11:49.760 --> 11:55.040
Created in 1982
by a charismatic Bulgarian genius...

11:55.200 --> 11:57.237
Excuse me, sweetheart.

11:57.440 --> 11:58.635
...Plemen Radkov.

11:59.080 --> 12:01.879
He was arrested in 1986
by the KGB...

12:02.080 --> 12:04.959
...and died seven months later
in a Siberian gulag.

12:05.160 --> 12:07.834
After that,
the Thrushes went underground.

12:08.080 --> 12:10.800
Their specialty
is not only cracking systems...

12:11.040 --> 12:14.511
...but doing so without leaving a trace
of their intrusion.

12:14.720 --> 12:18.191
The Thrushes choose their clientele
based on two criteria:

12:18.400 --> 12:21.472
cash and the technical challenge
of the hack.

12:21.640 --> 12:25.839
2009. The Ankara-Istanbul
high-speed railway system.

12:26.040 --> 12:30.193
Faulty ultrasound software
failed to detect stress fractures...

12:30.360 --> 12:35.674
...leading to a disastrous test run
costing the Turkish government billions.

12:37.760 --> 12:41.959
Crap. Crappers. Sorry. I got it.

12:42.160 --> 12:43.230
Crap. Crap. I got it.

12:44.080 --> 12:45.150
Last year...

12:45.320 --> 12:48.870
...a top-secret nuclear-fuel-enrichment
plant outside of Jaipur, India.

12:49.120 --> 12:54.559
Motor-speed variations destroyed
1200 industrial centrifuges.

12:54.760 --> 12:57.400
A colleague at the British embassy
was lead on that case.

12:57.560 --> 13:00.075
Thirty-eight people died,
thousands were exposed to radiation...

13:00.240 --> 13:01.720
...but they never found a hack.

13:01.960 --> 13:04.270
In both cases,
powerful interests stood to gain...

13:04.480 --> 13:07.040
...and now Alexander Kirk.

13:07.200 --> 13:12.400
Full access to all voice
and digital transmissions...

13:12.640 --> 13:16.475
...generated by the very people
dedicated to taking him down.

13:16.640 --> 13:18.472
I've heard enough.
Shut down the system.

13:18.640 --> 13:21.599
No, Harold,
this presents a unique opportunity...

13:21.760 --> 13:23.513
...to feed Kirk disinformation.

13:23.680 --> 13:25.876
Like the conversation
we had in your office.

13:26.040 --> 13:28.680
If he thinks I'm done with Reddington,
he might reach out.

13:28.880 --> 13:29.996
Or he might not.

13:30.200 --> 13:33.352
In the meantime, you're asking me
to allow a terrorist organization...

13:33.520 --> 13:35.318
...continued access
to classified data.

13:35.480 --> 13:37.199
This goes way beyond our operation.

13:37.360 --> 13:39.238
Our system's connected
to the NSA...

13:39.440 --> 13:41.875
...the CIA, the state, the White House.

13:42.080 --> 13:44.311
If we were to do this...

13:44.480 --> 13:46.278
...I'd have to clear it
with Panabaker.

13:46.440 --> 13:48.636
Samar, reach out
to your contact at the embassy.

13:48.840 --> 13:50.433
Review the Jaipur incident.

13:50.680 --> 13:52.194
Aram, go to the Post Office.

13:52.400 --> 13:55.120
Call the NSA and tear our system apart.

13:55.280 --> 13:57.795
Discreetly. We don't want them
to think we're on to them.

13:58.000 --> 14:00.231
We'll put every line of code
under a microscope.

14:00.480 --> 14:03.200
We have to find these hackers. Now.

14:04.080 --> 14:06.800
That act of yours between you
and Reddington had me going.

14:07.000 --> 14:08.832
Oh, it wasn't an act.

14:09.000 --> 14:13.517
I'm only putting up with Reddington
and his lies until we get Agnes back.

14:15.840 --> 14:18.275
Harold, you are one bubble off plumb.

14:18.440 --> 14:21.797
You think I'm gonna sit back while
how many horses run out of the barn?

14:22.000 --> 14:24.640
This is the best chance we have
of apprehending Kirk.

14:24.880 --> 14:27.600
This represents a five-alarm fire
to national security.

14:27.800 --> 14:30.269
Which is why we can't
shut down our system.

14:30.480 --> 14:34.394
The only way to learn how deeply we've
been penetrated is to find the Thrushes.

14:34.640 --> 14:37.838
We shut down our system now,
they'll know we're on to them and rabbit.

14:38.000 --> 14:39.036
Okay, Harold.

14:39.240 --> 14:41.072
Let them run out some line.

14:41.280 --> 14:42.839
But keep your thumb
on the drag...

14:43.000 --> 14:45.720
...or you're likely to find
a bird's nest on your reel.

14:46.120 --> 14:47.952
Not a word. Absolute gibberish.

14:48.120 --> 14:50.077
Well, let me translate.

14:50.280 --> 14:51.714
Don't screw up.

15:23.160 --> 15:24.992
I've been thinking...

15:25.160 --> 15:27.277
...you and I, we...

15:31.120 --> 15:32.520
We got a problem.

15:33.040 --> 15:34.759
The way I see it...

15:34.920 --> 15:37.879
...whoever shot you
is gonna shoot somebody else...

15:38.240 --> 15:40.675
...and dump them
where they dumped you...

15:40.880 --> 15:44.794
...and see you're not there.
And he's gonna come looking.

15:46.600 --> 15:47.920
Or...

15:48.120 --> 15:50.476
...somebody reports you missing...

15:50.640 --> 15:53.360
...and the cops come looking...

15:53.880 --> 15:54.916
...or...

15:56.040 --> 15:58.191
...I just let you go...

15:59.080 --> 16:01.675
...and you talk about
what happened here...

16:02.480 --> 16:04.597
...and whoever you talk to
comes looking.

16:04.800 --> 16:07.599
And I don't like visitors.

16:08.760 --> 16:10.991
So, what I'm trying to figure out is...

16:11.520 --> 16:15.400
...what exactly
am I gonna do with you?

16:16.360 --> 16:17.589
No one...

16:17.760 --> 16:19.877
...is coming.

16:20.240 --> 16:21.594
Is that a fact?

16:22.800 --> 16:26.476
I tried to kill myself.

16:27.280 --> 16:31.832
- Well, where's the gun?
- Somewhere back in the woods.

16:32.000 --> 16:35.277
Well, I don't suppose
you could lead me to it.

16:35.480 --> 16:38.314
I can't remember, I...

16:38.480 --> 16:40.995
...crawled away.

16:42.320 --> 16:45.711
Well, you left a trail.

16:48.200 --> 16:50.078
I'm a tracker.

16:51.320 --> 16:53.118
We'll see.

17:00.680 --> 17:04.276
I think camera two
a smidge to the left.

17:04.480 --> 17:05.960
- Juicy Deucey.
- Hello.

17:06.119 --> 17:08.031
A hair to the left, please.

17:08.240 --> 17:09.833
No, your other left, genius.

17:10.040 --> 17:11.838
- No...
- It's still messing up.

17:12.040 --> 17:13.997
I got it, I got it.
Got it, got it, got it.

17:14.640 --> 17:18.680
Chester's made some significant
upgrades to your security.

17:18.839 --> 17:20.911
- He's an absolute marvel.
- How nice.

17:21.119 --> 17:24.032
All I need now is a barbed-wire fence
and guard towers.

17:24.760 --> 17:27.229
- Any word from Kirk?
- You mean my father?

17:27.440 --> 17:29.591
Honestly, Elizabeth,
it astounds me...

17:29.760 --> 17:32.070
...that you could be hornswoggled
by something...

17:32.280 --> 17:35.034
...as simple to fabricate as
a DNA profile.

17:35.240 --> 17:37.311
Not just the DNA.

17:37.480 --> 17:39.233
It's memories.

17:39.400 --> 17:41.437
Places I recognize.

17:41.640 --> 17:43.040
Things we did together.

17:43.240 --> 17:45.118
A time capsule
we buried in the yard...

17:45.320 --> 17:46.640
...no one would know about.

17:46.800 --> 17:48.951
Just because
he was your mother's husband...

17:49.120 --> 17:52.477
- ...doesn't make him your father.
- You know what you sound like?

17:53.080 --> 17:54.434
Desperate.

17:54.840 --> 17:57.116
Just a suspect caught in a lie.

17:57.320 --> 17:59.118
I have never lied to you.

18:04.960 --> 18:07.839
Yes, this is she.

18:09.160 --> 18:10.674
I'll be along shortly. Thanks.

18:10.880 --> 18:13.634
It was a shoe repair-shop
in Georgetown I've never heard of.

18:13.840 --> 18:15.399
He says I left my phone there.

18:16.600 --> 18:18.193
Kirk.

18:29.360 --> 18:30.953
There's only one number saved.

18:31.160 --> 18:33.152
International prefix 40.

18:33.320 --> 18:35.915
Romania. No doubt untraceable.

18:48.200 --> 18:49.270
<i>Masha.</i>

18:49.480 --> 18:50.709
Tell me about Agnes.

18:50.880 --> 18:51.916
She's healthy.

18:52.080 --> 18:53.992
<i>She's happy.
Can't wait to see her mother.</i>

18:54.160 --> 18:56.117
<i>- You could make that happen.
- I want to.</i>

18:56.360 --> 18:59.000
But as long as you refuse
to shield her from Reddington...

18:59.200 --> 19:01.476
<i>...I can't.
- I got your SVR file.</i>

19:01.680 --> 19:03.399
Your DNA profile was in it.

19:03.600 --> 19:05.717
<i>I know you're my father.</i>

19:07.320 --> 19:09.437
<i>Then you know Reddington lied to you.</i>

19:09.600 --> 19:10.670
Yes.

19:10.920 --> 19:12.479
There's no reason
not to be together.

19:12.680 --> 19:14.512
<i>- What are you suggesting?
- A meeting.</i>

19:14.720 --> 19:16.677
Just the two of us and Agnes.

19:16.880 --> 19:17.916
That won't be easy.

19:18.080 --> 19:20.311
Reddington has his goons
guarding me 24/7.

19:20.480 --> 19:23.279
<i>- Because he doesn't trust you.
- I'll work something out.</i>

19:23.440 --> 19:24.510
Contact you.

19:31.760 --> 19:33.035
You were very convincing.

19:33.200 --> 19:35.715
That's because I meant every word.

19:36.400 --> 19:38.392
I don't trust her.

19:38.880 --> 19:40.633
You trust no one.

19:40.840 --> 19:42.479
That's why
you're so valuable to me.

19:42.640 --> 19:45.997
But in this matter, I do urge you
to trust me and my judgment.

20:26.360 --> 20:29.751
A case file on Jaipur.
Everything we have on Thrushes...

20:30.600 --> 20:31.875
...which is nothing.

20:32.120 --> 20:33.952
No source code,
no traceable malware?

20:34.120 --> 20:35.440
Quite the opposite.

20:35.640 --> 20:38.235
Cheeky bastards
actually debugged the system...

20:38.440 --> 20:39.954
...before uploading the virus.

20:40.160 --> 20:41.640
Of that, of course, there wasn't a trace.

20:41.880 --> 20:43.872
How does a computer virus do this?

20:44.040 --> 20:46.680
By taking operational control
of the plant...

20:46.840 --> 20:49.435
...causing speed variations
in the centrifuges...

20:49.680 --> 20:51.512
...leading to failure and the release...

20:51.680 --> 20:53.956
...of pressurized
uranium-hexafluoride gas.

20:54.160 --> 20:55.799
They were all engineers?

20:56.000 --> 21:00.119
Thirty-eight murders that are
impossible to solve.

21:00.360 --> 21:02.477
Unless only 37 were killed.

21:02.680 --> 21:04.194
What do you mean?

21:04.360 --> 21:07.558
This victim is not an engineer.

21:07.760 --> 21:10.480
And she is most certainly not dead.

21:12.400 --> 21:13.834
I knew she was too hot for him.

21:14.040 --> 21:16.236
When Aram finds out,
he's going to be crushed.

21:16.400 --> 21:18.551
Then he's gonna
wear his heart on his sleeve...

21:18.760 --> 21:21.798
...and his little girlfriend here
is gonna know we're onto her.

21:21.960 --> 21:23.758
We can't keep this from him.

21:23.920 --> 21:25.718
That's exactly what we're gonna do.

21:25.920 --> 21:29.277
Our objective is to feed the Thrushes
disinformation to draw out Kirk.

21:29.480 --> 21:32.154
The only way to do that is
by keeping Aram in the dark.

21:32.320 --> 21:34.118
Or you can let me interrogate her.

21:34.280 --> 21:36.476
- Five minutes and I'll have Kirk.
- Maybe.

21:36.680 --> 21:39.149
It'd take Kirk two minutes
to find out we're onto him.

21:39.360 --> 21:40.874
Then we lose him, the Thrushes...

21:41.040 --> 21:42.599
...and any hope of assessing...

21:42.800 --> 21:46.635
...how badly the breach at the Post
Office has damaged national security.

21:47.200 --> 21:48.520
Aram.

21:49.680 --> 21:51.876
- Are you all right?
- What's wrong?

21:52.120 --> 21:53.634
Everything.

21:54.560 --> 21:55.994
Everything's wrong.

21:56.160 --> 21:57.435
Sir, I did as you ordered...

21:57.640 --> 21:59.472
...and isolated the malicious code...

21:59.680 --> 22:02.115
...or remnants of it buried
in our operating system.

22:02.320 --> 22:03.913
At first, I was confused.

22:04.080 --> 22:07.198
Our firewall should have bounced it,
but then...

22:07.680 --> 22:10.957
...I realized the only way
we could have been breached...

22:11.160 --> 22:13.072
...was through social engineering...

22:13.280 --> 22:15.317
...or physical access
with a rubber ducky.

22:15.560 --> 22:17.995
- A what?
- A keystroke-injection attack platform...

22:18.160 --> 22:19.958
...disguised as a thumb drive.

22:20.440 --> 22:22.432
It bypasses
all standard countermeasures...

22:22.600 --> 22:26.389
...by emulating a plug-in keyboard,
reprogramming our host computer...

22:26.600 --> 22:28.956
...as if the hacker
was manually typing in the code.

22:29.160 --> 22:32.232
- The culprit would have to plug it in.
- Yes.

22:32.440 --> 22:37.231
Someone had to dupe an FBI employee
with level-four clearance.

22:37.440 --> 22:40.512
I spent the last 18 hours
collating logins...

22:40.680 --> 22:42.637
...with the first appearance
of the code...

22:42.840 --> 22:46.151
...in order to figure out who got punked,
so we could interview them...

22:46.320 --> 22:49.154
- ...and nail that hacker.
- And it was you.

22:53.880 --> 22:55.360
You knew.

22:56.880 --> 23:00.317
She was a key player
in the Jaipur centrifuge hack.

23:09.640 --> 23:11.552
Why didn't you tell me?

23:14.200 --> 23:17.193
We wanted to,
but we thought if you knew...

23:17.360 --> 23:18.589
...she might pick it up.

23:18.800 --> 23:21.440
Look, you didn't tell her anything,
did you?

23:21.600 --> 23:22.750
No.

23:22.960 --> 23:25.794
I may be dumb, but I'm not stupid.

23:26.080 --> 23:28.151
I just don't know
how I'm gonna pull this off.

23:28.320 --> 23:30.960
- Pull what off?
- She's coming over for dinner tonight.

23:31.160 --> 23:32.833
I don't think that's a good idea.

23:33.000 --> 23:36.357
No, it is a horrible idea.

23:36.600 --> 23:38.956
But I have to
if we're gonna have any chance...

23:39.120 --> 23:41.874
- ...of accessing the Thrushes' servers.
- What do you mean?

23:44.400 --> 23:46.437
I've got my own rubber ducky.

23:50.360 --> 23:53.159
<i>- What if she doesn't have her laptop?
- Oh, she'll have it.</i>

23:53.360 --> 23:55.829
<i>We're binge-watching
Stranger Things.</i>

23:56.160 --> 23:58.038
Talk about life imitating art.

23:58.400 --> 24:00.869
- How long to upload the worm?
- A few minutes.

24:01.080 --> 24:04.915
I designed it to ping the main servers
and e-mail us GPS coordinates.

24:05.480 --> 24:08.359
- Which wire would you like?
- Well, not the fob. I hate the fob.

24:08.520 --> 24:12.196
- It's too much clanking with the key ring.
- Okay. The pen.

24:13.360 --> 24:15.431
Never been on the...

24:16.320 --> 24:17.595
The sending side of one.

24:18.000 --> 24:19.878
Yeah, I don't know if I can do this.

24:20.880 --> 24:22.519
This is an LCR.357.

24:22.680 --> 24:24.000
- It's light, reliable...
- No.

24:24.200 --> 24:27.113
- Am I gonna shoot my girlfriend?
- She's not your girlfriend.

24:27.360 --> 24:29.829
She's a hostile operative,
and you're a federal agent.

24:30.000 --> 24:33.038
I'm not sending you in there
without a piece, do you understand?

24:33.240 --> 24:34.833
I'm not like you.

24:37.240 --> 24:38.469
I'm really scared.

24:38.960 --> 24:42.556
I know, but I promise you'll be fine.

24:43.320 --> 24:45.277
I'll have your back.

24:46.120 --> 24:48.874
No safety catch.
You just draw, point, and shoot.

24:49.040 --> 24:50.520
Five shots, fully loaded.

24:50.720 --> 24:53.519
If anything goes wrong
the safety word is "banana."

24:54.680 --> 24:56.797
- Banana?
- Use it, and in come the Marines.

24:56.960 --> 25:00.112
They better get there before me
because I'll mess that bitch up.

25:00.320 --> 25:03.040
- Really?
- Oh, yeah, really.

25:03.720 --> 25:05.552
Okay.

25:11.480 --> 25:13.233
Good luck.

25:14.120 --> 25:16.032
That dream date.

25:16.560 --> 25:18.392
The crispy beef.

25:18.880 --> 25:20.394
Ginger beer.

25:21.080 --> 25:22.560
That was all you, wasn't it?

25:24.800 --> 25:26.917
I knew it was too good
to be true.

25:33.160 --> 25:37.712
When I turned myself in, I never
imagined things could have turned out...

25:37.920 --> 25:40.719
...this badly.

25:40.960 --> 25:42.440
What did you expect?

25:42.640 --> 25:44.711
I knew it'd be hard, but I...

25:45.400 --> 25:47.960
...never expected that it would get...

25:48.400 --> 25:50.835
...harder with every day.

25:51.800 --> 25:53.029
It shouldn't be a surprise.

25:53.280 --> 25:55.840
There was a chance she'd discover
Kirk was her father...

25:56.000 --> 25:57.992
...when you put him on your list.

25:58.360 --> 25:59.680
He was never on it.

25:59.880 --> 26:02.873
He never would have been
if he hadn't come after her first.

26:03.080 --> 26:06.118
If anyone belongs on that cursed list
it's Alexander Kirk.

26:06.280 --> 26:07.714
Why wouldn't you put him there?

26:07.920 --> 26:09.957
- He's my father.
- She's our daughter.

26:10.120 --> 26:13.591
You know what's gonna happen
if I make that call.

26:14.760 --> 26:18.549
He's the only one who can give me
answers about my past, my mother.

26:18.760 --> 26:20.752
They'll put him in a hole.
I'll never see him again.

26:20.920 --> 26:24.311
If you don't,
we may never see Agnes again.

26:24.840 --> 26:26.672
<i>I knew it would complicate things.</i>

26:26.880 --> 26:29.998
I'd be forced to take security measures,
things she'd hate.

26:30.200 --> 26:32.920
Now all I see
is the resentment in her eyes.

26:33.520 --> 26:35.113
<i>I'm suffocating her, Harold.</i>

26:35.320 --> 26:36.515
You sure?

26:36.680 --> 26:38.717
She's our daughter.

26:44.440 --> 26:47.239
<i>- You've decided.
- You abducted me once.</i>

26:47.440 --> 26:49.671
What assurances do I have
you won't do it again?

26:49.920 --> 26:52.116
Things have changed. The DNA test.

26:52.320 --> 26:53.913
I want this to be real.

26:54.320 --> 26:56.516
<i>I'll contact you with instructions.</i>

26:57.160 --> 26:59.675
I'm sorry, I couldn't wait. I know.

26:59.880 --> 27:04.636
I have no self-control,
but I watched the last three episodes.

27:04.840 --> 27:08.117
You're probably gonna hate me,
but you'll never believe what happens.

27:08.280 --> 27:10.351
<i>- What?
- The last episodes. Stranger Things.</i>

27:10.560 --> 27:11.596
Yeah.

27:11.760 --> 27:12.830
Can't wait.

27:13.600 --> 27:15.432
Aram, what's...?

27:15.760 --> 27:16.796
What's going on?

27:17.440 --> 27:18.556
You seem preoccupied.

27:18.720 --> 27:21.189
<i>Me? No. I'm just...</i>

27:21.400 --> 27:23.278
I forgot. I got wine.

27:24.000 --> 27:25.514
You don't drink.

27:25.720 --> 27:29.031
It's for you.
It's supposed to go great with...

27:30.080 --> 27:32.197
- Puttanesca?
- Yes, yum.

27:32.400 --> 27:34.153
Puttanesca.

27:34.360 --> 27:35.635
Puttanesca.

27:35.840 --> 27:39.038
<i>- You never told me about your day.
- Oh, you know, the usual FBI stuff.</i>

27:39.240 --> 27:41.232
<i>You know, good guys, bad guys.</i>

27:41.400 --> 27:45.314
Oh, they got cheese nibs
for the snack machine downstairs.

27:45.520 --> 27:47.432
- So, so awesome.
- Cheese nibs.

27:47.640 --> 27:49.359
- He's fine.
- He's like a gerbil on meth.

27:49.600 --> 27:51.159
<i>I know, right? I love cheese nibs.</i>

27:51.360 --> 27:53.591
<i>I don't love them as much
as Goldfish...</i>

27:53.800 --> 27:55.473
...but it's a huge... It's a huge...

27:56.040 --> 27:57.554
- Oh, God, oh, God.
- Oh, God.

27:57.720 --> 27:59.279
- I'm such a klutz.
- No, no.

27:59.760 --> 28:00.989
It's what I love about you.

28:03.920 --> 28:05.513
You know what?

28:06.000 --> 28:07.753
Just give me a...

28:07.960 --> 28:10.236
Give me a second to go change.

28:29.400 --> 28:30.516
He's uploading now.

28:30.720 --> 28:32.837
<i>Aram? You okay?</i>

28:33.480 --> 28:35.119
Yeah.

28:35.600 --> 28:36.954
Yeah, everything's...

28:37.120 --> 28:39.794
Everything is great.

28:39.960 --> 28:42.156
Are you hungry? Because I sure am.

28:42.400 --> 28:43.720
I am hungry.

28:46.400 --> 28:47.914
<i>We shouldn't.</i>

28:48.560 --> 28:51.200
- Your sauce, I think it's burning.
- We can order takeout.

28:52.520 --> 28:55.319
No, I'm serious.
We're gonna set this place on fire.

28:55.520 --> 28:56.920
Sounds good.

28:57.080 --> 28:58.355
<i>No, no, no.</i>

28:58.560 --> 28:59.880
Elise, no. No.

29:00.080 --> 29:02.549
- I'm serious. Just not now.
- God.

29:02.760 --> 29:03.796
Okay?

29:05.320 --> 29:07.039
Are you gonna tell me
what's going on?

29:07.720 --> 29:09.074
I don't want to cause a fire.

29:09.280 --> 29:10.839
I know you, Aram.

29:11.040 --> 29:12.520
You're lying to me.

29:12.720 --> 29:14.916
You're hiding something
and we're not going anywhere...

29:15.120 --> 29:17.191
...until you tell me what it is.

29:21.040 --> 29:23.271
Tell me, Aram, now. The truth.

29:23.440 --> 29:24.760
- Nothing.
- He's in trouble.

29:24.920 --> 29:26.274
<i>You're lying. I can tell.</i>

29:27.960 --> 29:29.360
Okay, you're right.

29:29.520 --> 29:31.318
There's something. There's...

29:32.760 --> 29:34.558
...someone else.

29:36.280 --> 29:37.600
<i>Someone else? What?</i>

29:37.760 --> 29:39.240
<i>Who? What are you talking about?</i>

29:39.840 --> 29:41.274
I am in love with someone else.

29:50.600 --> 29:53.274
- It's Samar, isn't it?
- What? No.

29:53.520 --> 29:56.319
- That girl from your office.
- Of course not. Not her.

29:56.960 --> 29:59.520
<i>- God, I feel so stupid.
- No. No, don't.</i>

29:59.720 --> 30:02.599
I don't want you to feel stupid.
This is all my fault.

30:02.760 --> 30:06.674
I should have told you about...
Not Samar... I don't want you to feel...

30:09.160 --> 30:12.756
- What?
- Has our tap been compromised?

30:12.920 --> 30:14.354
<i>One minute.</i>

30:14.520 --> 30:16.239
It's work.

30:20.240 --> 30:22.994
<i>- No, everything's fine.
- Are you quite certain?</i>

30:23.200 --> 30:24.270
<i>Absolutely. Why?</i>

30:24.440 --> 30:28.559
Because your client is about to expose
himself on the basis of your intel.

30:28.760 --> 30:31.070
If you're wrong
and he is harmed in any way...

30:31.240 --> 30:33.277
...I will personally see to it
that you...

30:33.480 --> 30:35.312
<i>...and the Thrushes are exterminated.</i>

30:35.520 --> 30:37.352
<i>Now, are you certain?</i>

30:37.560 --> 30:39.517
Fine. I'll run another system check.

30:39.680 --> 30:42.195
Good. You do that.
I'll call back in 10 minutes.

31:07.680 --> 31:09.319
Quack, quack, bitch.

31:14.960 --> 31:15.996
<i>Banana.</i>

31:17.520 --> 31:18.840
I could use a banana.

31:23.720 --> 31:26.076
Okay, okay. Banana.

31:37.360 --> 31:38.840
Okay, okay, okay.

31:39.040 --> 31:40.554
Oh, Jesus. No.

31:40.760 --> 31:42.353
Drop it!

31:46.480 --> 31:47.914
Hey.

31:48.520 --> 31:49.749
I got this.

31:49.960 --> 31:52.111
<i>- Notify when you have the asset.
- You all right?</i>

31:54.640 --> 31:55.835
Are you okay?

31:56.000 --> 31:58.754
Yeah. Yeah.

31:59.320 --> 32:02.119
What part of "banana"
did you not understand?

32:02.600 --> 32:03.954
We have the target in custody.

32:04.120 --> 32:07.079
We have a tap on her computer,
and thanks to Aram...

32:07.320 --> 32:09.437
- ...we'll find the Thrushes.
- We busted Kirk's mole.

32:09.600 --> 32:10.920
That'll make him suspicious.

32:11.080 --> 32:12.116
No.

32:12.320 --> 32:16.280
I mean, yes, of course
but he was already suspicious.

32:16.480 --> 32:18.153
When we were together
she got a call.

32:18.320 --> 32:19.436
Kirk's people.

32:19.600 --> 32:23.833
They wanted final verification
that the tap had not been compromised.

32:24.080 --> 32:25.673
Once she was in custody,
we had her notify them...

32:25.880 --> 32:28.111
- ...that the tap was clear.
- By phone?

32:28.320 --> 32:29.879
Yes. At gunpoint.

32:30.040 --> 32:33.078
So, what you're saying is
you heard her say the tap was clean...

32:33.240 --> 32:36.677
...but for all you know she could
have been sending some message.

32:36.880 --> 32:38.678
A signal that everything was not okay.

32:38.880 --> 32:40.439
Are you suggesting we call it off?

32:40.640 --> 32:42.313
What I am suggesting is...

32:42.520 --> 32:46.150
...Kirk's supposed to be the one
walking into a trap here, not me.

32:46.360 --> 32:47.840
We'll have safeguards in place.

32:48.040 --> 32:49.520
Security won't be compromised.

32:49.720 --> 32:52.713
I don't believe Elizabeth's concern
is about her security...

32:52.920 --> 32:54.115
...or her daughter's.

32:54.320 --> 32:56.915
That is my only concern.

32:57.160 --> 32:59.880
Clearly, your only concern
is that it might bother me...

33:00.080 --> 33:02.800
...that I'm about to entrap
my biological father.

33:03.000 --> 33:05.390
That because of me,
he's gonna go to prison for life.

33:05.560 --> 33:07.153
If I go through with this...

33:07.360 --> 33:10.717
...you will be my only link
to my past.

33:11.080 --> 33:14.039
I lost Sam, I lost my mother.

33:14.240 --> 33:16.630
I'll lose Kirk,
and whatever you want to call him...

33:16.800 --> 33:20.191
...he was married to my mother.
He raised me as a child...

33:20.360 --> 33:22.636
...and he's willing to do
what you are not:

33:22.840 --> 33:24.069
Tell me about who I am.

33:24.280 --> 33:25.634
Liz.

33:29.160 --> 33:32.119
We got word from Kirk.
He texted the burner phone.

33:39.880 --> 33:40.950
The meeting's set.

33:41.160 --> 33:42.276
5:30 a.m.

33:45.200 --> 33:47.669
"Manhattan. BMT Nassau street line.

33:48.120 --> 33:49.679
Delancey Street and Bowery."

33:49.920 --> 33:52.071
That station's
been abandoned for years.

33:52.280 --> 33:53.839
Call FBI, SWAT, New York.

33:55.640 --> 33:59.031
I'll be handling Kirk
on my own, Harold.

33:59.200 --> 34:01.669
- If you expect us to stand down...
- I do...

34:02.000 --> 34:04.754
...if you expect this relationship
to continue.

34:06.760 --> 34:08.717
You sure about this?

34:09.480 --> 34:10.675
No.

34:11.199 --> 34:13.476
I'm not sure about any of this.

34:29.199 --> 34:30.600
You lied to me.

34:31.719 --> 34:32.835
I didn't.

34:33.000 --> 34:36.914
Shooting yourself
isn't a spectator sport.

34:44.639 --> 34:46.791
Motion-activated.

34:47.080 --> 34:48.878
Three come in.

34:49.719 --> 34:51.040
Two go out.

34:55.760 --> 34:57.831
Are you gonna get straight with me...

34:58.000 --> 35:00.754
...or are we gonna
keep playing games?

35:04.640 --> 35:06.120
It's her.

35:06.600 --> 35:09.035
<i>- Masha.
- It's off. We can't meet. It's not safe.</i>

35:09.240 --> 35:11.675
No, no, no. I secured the location.

35:11.920 --> 35:13.400
<i>You have my word you'll be safe.</i>

35:13.560 --> 35:15.517
The FBI knows about your mole.

35:15.720 --> 35:17.074
<i>They've got her in custody.</i>

35:17.240 --> 35:19.800
<i>- Reddington tipped them.
- They know about our meeting.</i>

35:20.080 --> 35:21.833
The time, location, I'm telling you.

35:22.040 --> 35:24.350
<i>- It's a trap.
- Are you still willing to meet?</i>

35:24.600 --> 35:27.069
<i>- You, me, and Agnes.
- It's not just the FBI.</i>

35:27.280 --> 35:29.158
<i>- Reddington knows.
- Doesn't matter.</i>

35:29.320 --> 35:32.711
- I have an alternate location.
- What are you doing?

35:33.520 --> 35:35.398
Masha, listen to me very closely.

35:35.600 --> 35:37.557
Here's what I want you to do.

35:43.920 --> 35:48.153
Maintenance tunnels here,
here and here...

35:48.320 --> 35:50.516
...give us access
to the rendezvous point.

35:50.720 --> 35:53.030
Elizabeth left 10 minutes before us.

35:53.200 --> 35:55.590
We need to breach in five.

35:58.880 --> 36:00.837
Where's Agnes?

36:01.960 --> 36:03.076
Masha.

36:07.000 --> 36:09.356
You said three of us.

36:10.520 --> 36:11.556
Where is she?

36:11.720 --> 36:12.915
Close.

36:13.080 --> 36:16.039
I'll bring her to you as soon
as Reddington has been dealt with.

36:16.200 --> 36:17.873
What are you talking about?

36:21.400 --> 36:23.312
<i>Smile, solnishko.</i>

36:23.480 --> 36:26.473
In less than five minutes,
he'll be dead.

36:26.800 --> 36:30.840
I have a small army awaiting his arrival
at the Delancey Street station.

36:31.400 --> 36:33.517
<i>- That wasn't our agreement.
- No.</i>

36:33.680 --> 36:36.354
<i>But you know as well as I do
it needs to be done.</i>

36:36.560 --> 36:38.552
<i>I picked you...</i>

36:39.480 --> 36:40.800
...over him.

36:41.000 --> 36:42.878
I lied to everyone for you.

36:43.080 --> 36:44.799
Now you want to kill him?

36:45.280 --> 36:47.237
- You can't do that.
- I'm doing this for us.

36:47.400 --> 36:48.436
I know you're sick.

36:48.640 --> 36:52.111
I know Agnes and I are nothing more
than possible donors for you.

36:52.280 --> 36:53.430
Oh, come now.

36:54.200 --> 36:57.238
You know if that were true,
all of this would've been resolved...

36:57.440 --> 37:00.638
...with your abduction.
True, it's a consideration...

37:00.880 --> 37:03.793
...but the only circumstance
under which I'll accept help...

37:04.240 --> 37:05.560
...is if it's given freely.

37:05.960 --> 37:07.030
We had a deal.

37:07.240 --> 37:08.799
Patience, dove.

37:11.440 --> 37:13.238
Romina.

37:33.920 --> 37:35.149
<i>You'll see, solnishko.</i>

37:35.480 --> 37:37.073
Soon, you will be free.

37:42.000 --> 37:43.878
Don't shoot! He's got Agnes!

37:51.640 --> 37:53.313
Down.

37:58.080 --> 37:59.514
Don't!

38:00.080 --> 38:03.517
You may lack the courage to do
what must be done, but I do not.

38:05.400 --> 38:07.392
I will take her with me.

38:07.680 --> 38:09.751
One way or the other.

38:10.840 --> 38:13.594
This is madness, Constantin.

38:14.800 --> 38:17.269
Because you cannot have that child,
you'll take her...

38:17.520 --> 38:19.989
...forever, from her mother?

38:20.160 --> 38:21.992
It's madness.

38:22.920 --> 38:25.151
Constantin, this needs to end now.

38:25.360 --> 38:26.840
Yes, you're right.

38:27.520 --> 38:28.590
It needs to end.

38:30.520 --> 38:32.159
Stand down. Stand down!

38:34.880 --> 38:36.109
Don't do this.

38:36.280 --> 38:38.476
<i>There is no other way, solnishko.</i>

38:39.080 --> 38:42.596
This man that took your mother
away from us took you from me.

38:42.840 --> 38:44.274
He won't have my granddaughter.

38:44.440 --> 38:47.512
And I hate him as much
as you do for it.

38:48.080 --> 38:50.390
But if you love me...

38:51.560 --> 38:53.916
...if you ever loved me...

38:54.120 --> 38:55.315
...just give her to me.

38:55.800 --> 38:57.154
Please.

39:03.560 --> 39:05.472
Please, Father.

39:32.720 --> 39:34.439
- I was an idiot.
- No.

39:34.640 --> 39:36.552
You were human.

39:36.720 --> 39:39.633
You wanted something,
and she was trained to exploit that.

39:39.840 --> 39:41.991
- Trained or born?
- You tell me.

39:42.160 --> 39:43.230
You did a good job...

39:43.440 --> 39:46.080
...playing the
I'm-in-love-with-another-woman card.

39:46.480 --> 39:47.914
Nicely done.

39:51.920 --> 39:55.197
I thought you'd like to know
that I'm rescinding my transfer request.

39:55.400 --> 39:56.914
What?

39:57.280 --> 40:00.034
That's great. I mean...

40:00.240 --> 40:01.799
For real?
Because if that's true...

40:02.040 --> 40:05.397
- ...we have to celebrate, right?
- Do you like Paco's Tacos?

40:05.560 --> 40:06.960
I was told there were some...

40:07.800 --> 40:09.553
...leftovers upstairs in the fridge.

40:09.760 --> 40:10.796
I love them.

41:09.040 --> 41:12.238
I just wanted to thank you
for trusting me.

41:12.400 --> 41:13.914
Trusting the plan.

41:14.640 --> 41:16.757
I understand what a...

41:16.920 --> 41:18.559
...leap of faith it must have been.

41:18.720 --> 41:22.111
Not really,
considering what was at stake.

41:24.240 --> 41:25.913
May I?

41:38.880 --> 41:41.236
She's a beautiful girl.

41:41.640 --> 41:43.950
Yeah, she is.

41:49.240 --> 41:53.473
So now that Kirk has been captured...

41:53.680 --> 41:57.037
...we are no longer gonna live
under your guard.

41:57.440 --> 41:59.875
We're gonna find a place of our own.

42:01.120 --> 42:02.440
I know.

42:07.640 --> 42:08.869
Good night, Elizabeth.

42:09.040 --> 42:10.554
Tom.
