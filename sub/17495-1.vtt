WEBVTT

00:01.234 --> 00:01.434
.

00:08.775 --> 00:10.543
The Geordie squad are back.

00:14.314 --> 00:17.016
Last time, the whole family
was reunited.

00:17.083 --> 00:18.952
Bigger, better than ever before.

00:21.888 --> 00:24.290
Charlotte and Gaz went head-to-head

00:24.357 --> 00:27.127
in the biggest battle
Newcastle has ever seen.

00:27.193 --> 00:30.163
Team Charlotte!
(cheering)

00:30.230 --> 00:32.165
Aaron and Marnie finally banged.

00:33.733 --> 00:37.137
They look like they're gonna
take it to the next level.

00:37.203 --> 00:41.741
Chloe and Marty got it on, but
no-one knows what's going on.

00:41.808 --> 00:43.777
Gaz and Charlotte got back together.

00:43.843 --> 00:47.781
I never thought, five years on,
I'd be doing this.

00:47.847 --> 00:51.584
It's only ever been Gary
and it only ever will be Gary.

00:51.651 --> 00:53.119
But things all went west.

00:53.186 --> 00:54.988
(weeps) What have I done?

00:55.054 --> 00:56.823
All right?
It's not working!

00:56.890 --> 00:58.525
It's not gonna work!

00:58.591 --> 01:01.194
We're not meant to be together.
That kills us.

01:03.296 --> 01:05.465
This time, it's gonna be massive.

01:05.532 --> 01:07.267
Fuck off, Newcastle!

01:08.368 --> 01:12.172
We're gonna mission
around all the party islands.

01:12.238 --> 01:15.208
(screaming)

01:16.409 --> 01:18.678
Things are about to get
Lionel Messi.

01:20.713 --> 01:23.183
There's gonna be pool parties.

01:23.249 --> 01:25.718
Boat parties.

01:25.785 --> 01:27.320
Paint parties.

01:27.387 --> 01:29.756
The biggest parties
of our fucking lives.

01:31.191 --> 01:32.992
More necking on.

01:34.127 --> 01:36.095
Oh, shit.

01:36.162 --> 01:38.665
There's gonna be
shitloads of bucking.

01:40.667 --> 01:43.736
Belly flop! Belly flop!

01:43.803 --> 01:45.405
Let's fucking do this.

01:47.240 --> 01:49.909
There's gonna be carnage.
Fucking little slag!

01:53.947 --> 01:56.249
Kick-offs.

01:56.316 --> 01:58.718
Marnie, Marnie!

01:59.752 --> 02:01.387
Drama.
Fuck off!

02:05.124 --> 02:06.893
Oh, my God!
(siren)

02:06.960 --> 02:09.162
Let's get fucking mortal!

02:10.430 --> 02:13.533
This is the ultimate
party island crawl.

02:15.468 --> 02:16.503
(farts)

02:16.569 --> 02:19.372
Welcome to the girls' room,
you little radge packet!

02:21.241 --> 02:23.042
I have a degree in pulling women.

02:23.109 --> 02:25.378
I'd never kiss anyone
without a six-pack.

02:25.445 --> 02:28.548
I'm a natural beauty,
real boobs, real hair.

02:28.615 --> 02:30.517
I'm gonna tear the place up.

02:30.583 --> 02:33.219
I'm radge and I wrap lads
around my little finger.

02:33.286 --> 02:34.921
I'm preened to perfection.

02:34.988 --> 02:37.156
I'm totally crackers me, like.

02:37.223 --> 02:39.425
I'm cheeky and full of mischief.

02:39.492 --> 02:41.694
Me banter's pure naughty.

02:41.761 --> 02:43.930
I'm fit, flirty
and I've got double Fs.

02:43.997 --> 02:45.632
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

02:49.969 --> 02:53.640
(phone rings)

02:53.706 --> 02:57.977
Which rascal has the fucking nerve
to ring me at this time? The dafty.

02:58.044 --> 03:00.246
Hi, Scotty.
Oh, hello.

03:00.313 --> 03:02.448
"How are you?"
Fresh as a daisy.

03:02.515 --> 03:04.250
Anna, what does she want?

03:04.317 --> 03:05.885
Probably me fucking D.

03:05.952 --> 03:08.721
What type of bikini is that?
I can see your nipples.

03:08.788 --> 03:11.558
"It's not a bikini.
You will never see my nipples."

03:11.624 --> 03:14.627
"You've got a very, very busy
few weeks ahead of you."

03:14.694 --> 03:16.930
What do you mean?
"I want you packed."

03:16.996 --> 03:20.166
Where we going?
"I'm sending you to Magaluf."

03:20.233 --> 03:21.701
Shut up! (laughs)

03:21.768 --> 03:24.504
Magaluf, what a fucking belter.

03:24.571 --> 03:27.807
"It's not a holiday, Scotty.
It is work."

03:27.874 --> 03:29.375
Yes, sir.

03:29.442 --> 03:32.345
I better text the radgies.
"What's up, crew?"

03:32.412 --> 03:36.282
Space, "How you fucking feeling?"
Dot, dot, dot.

03:36.349 --> 03:37.517
Why-aye, party crew.

03:37.584 --> 03:39.485
Slag Anna's called us to work.

03:39.552 --> 03:41.921
We're flying to Shagaluf,
that's Magaluf.

03:41.988 --> 03:43.022
Today?

03:43.089 --> 03:45.258
Pack your bikinis.
Get your tits out.

03:45.325 --> 03:47.460
See you in the airport in two hours.

03:47.527 --> 03:48.828
Fucking here we go.

03:49.896 --> 03:51.331
(phone rings)

03:51.397 --> 03:53.366
Hello?
"Hello, y'all right?"

03:53.433 --> 03:55.301
Aye, good, man. What's the matter?

03:55.368 --> 03:59.305
"Pack wuh bags cos we're going
to Magaluf. Today." Magaluf?!

03:59.372 --> 04:03.109
Aaron better hurry up and get to my
house cos I'll be packed in no time.

04:05.111 --> 04:08.448
Buzzing! Magaluf with these radgies?
I better get packing.

04:08.514 --> 04:10.850
Got myself into
a bit of pickle here.

04:12.185 --> 04:16.322
I'm supposed to be looking after
my new nose. I'm so clumsy.

04:17.390 --> 04:19.392
Maga-fucking-luf!

04:21.694 --> 04:23.563
Bye.
Be good.

04:23.630 --> 04:24.797
Piss off.

04:29.002 --> 04:30.003
(screams)

04:30.069 --> 04:32.372
Nathan's here.
We're going to the airport.

04:32.438 --> 04:34.574
My mam has to sit
in the passenger seat.

04:34.641 --> 04:36.576
I failed my test ten times!

04:36.643 --> 04:39.345
Oh, God. Chloe,
your driving skills are shit.

04:39.412 --> 04:42.882
We need to be down with the lingo,
so repeat after me, Chloe.

04:42.949 --> 04:45.184
Vamos...
Vamos...

04:45.251 --> 04:46.519
...a...
...a...

04:46.586 --> 04:48.388
...echa un...
...un...

04:48.454 --> 04:49.455
...bueno caldo.

04:49.522 --> 04:51.324
What the fuck's this prick doing?

04:51.391 --> 04:54.127
Now I'm gonna have to...
It doesn't mean that.

04:54.193 --> 04:55.461
(beeping)

04:55.528 --> 04:57.563
Magaluf.
(Gaz laughs)

04:57.630 --> 05:00.266
We're off to Magaluf, lad. Woo!

05:00.333 --> 05:01.668
Magaluf is nuts.

05:01.734 --> 05:04.103
Oh, get tanned up
and just chill out.

05:09.876 --> 05:13.413
Do you know what it is? I don't
think I could have done any more

05:13.479 --> 05:14.614
to get with that girl.

05:14.681 --> 05:17.717
Charlotte's not coming to Magaluf
and I am gutted.

05:17.784 --> 05:20.219
I'm just pleased
I've got Aaron to talk to.

05:20.286 --> 05:23.222
I was 100% wanting that.
I wanted to get with that girl.

05:23.289 --> 05:26.659
I just think if it was gonna work,
it would have been then.

05:26.726 --> 05:29.062
It's a shame it didn't work out.

05:29.128 --> 05:32.031
But he needs to move on.
And I'll always be his wing man.

05:34.233 --> 05:37.170
Charlotte's not coming to Magaluf
and I'm gutted.

05:37.236 --> 05:41.307
That means I'm gonna have to make an
effort to have fun without her.

05:43.109 --> 05:44.143
Here we go.

05:48.815 --> 05:51.884
Oy-oy! The fastest cock
in the North East has just arrived.

05:51.951 --> 05:53.986
Let we gan radge.

05:54.053 --> 05:56.823
Me and Scott left
on really good terms last time.

05:56.889 --> 06:00.026
And he's looking canny nice.
So, let's see what happens.

06:00.093 --> 06:02.428
Magaluf! Shagaluf!

06:08.234 --> 06:10.970
Let's have it.
Hi, boys! Hello.

06:11.037 --> 06:15.007
Me and Marnie banged and tried to
make a go of it. It didn't happen.

06:15.074 --> 06:19.879
Hopefully, sun, sea and sand will
help with that this time around.

06:19.946 --> 06:21.848
Me and Aaron got on
so well last time,

06:21.914 --> 06:24.183
in fact, we were almost a couple.

06:24.250 --> 06:27.787
I do still have feelings for him,
so I'm hoping this time is our time.

06:27.854 --> 06:29.722
Shame that Charlotte's not here.

06:29.789 --> 06:33.659
Now that the family's back together,
it's so obvious someone's missing.

06:33.726 --> 06:36.462
I'm gonna miss her so much.
Definitely.

06:36.529 --> 06:39.499
Charlotte's not here,
but we need to make the most of it,

06:39.565 --> 06:41.200
Maga here we come!

06:41.267 --> 06:43.336
Magaluf!

06:44.437 --> 06:46.439
It's my first time away with them.

06:46.506 --> 06:48.841
I cannot wait to see
what's gonna happen.

06:52.612 --> 06:53.946
Yay!

06:57.150 --> 06:59.585
Sun, sea and Scotty T.

07:02.121 --> 07:04.757
(screaming)

07:04.824 --> 07:08.027
We have arrived in Magaluf,
this is gonna be unreal.

07:08.094 --> 07:10.129
My God, it's so warm.

07:10.196 --> 07:14.767
This sun is pure beaming, this time
I might actually get a tan.

07:14.834 --> 07:17.103
How the fuck
can you misspell Geordie?

07:17.170 --> 07:19.138
G-E-O...

07:19.205 --> 07:22.175
...R-D-I-E. Nearly did it wrong.

07:28.114 --> 07:30.917
We've arrived and the gates
are opening.

07:30.983 --> 07:32.518
Oh, my fucking God!

07:32.585 --> 07:33.886
(screaming)

07:33.953 --> 07:35.221
It is amazing.

07:35.288 --> 07:38.024
(screaming)

07:47.733 --> 07:49.735
Oh, my God!

07:49.802 --> 07:50.937
All of us are buzzing.

07:51.003 --> 07:53.172
This villa is the best one
we've ever had.

07:53.239 --> 07:55.541
Quick, quick, quick, quick!

07:55.608 --> 07:58.344
Scoping out the villa
and the place looks amazing.

07:58.411 --> 08:00.646
I can't wait to get
stuck in to Magaluf.

08:00.713 --> 08:04.317
Shotgun! To be fair,
the villa is fucking lethal.

08:04.383 --> 08:07.486
(screaming)

08:07.553 --> 08:10.523
We are running through the house
like fucking lunatics.

08:10.590 --> 08:12.325
(screaming)

08:12.391 --> 08:14.327
Trust me to find the shag pad.

08:14.393 --> 08:15.494
Top shagger, me.

08:15.561 --> 08:17.463
This is unreal.

08:17.530 --> 08:20.266
Howay, man, Chloe.
You literally shag anything.

08:20.333 --> 08:22.568
Even if it hasn't got a pulse.

08:22.635 --> 08:27.173
Now everyone's settled in, let's get
this fucking party started.

08:27.240 --> 08:30.877
Anyway, here's to the start
of a wicked summer, again.

08:30.943 --> 08:32.611
(cheering)

08:32.678 --> 08:35.815
I'm sweating my balls off,
let's get in that fucking pool.

08:41.554 --> 08:44.423
This place is mint.
All hanging round the pool,

08:44.490 --> 08:45.558
soaking up some sun.

08:45.625 --> 08:48.694
It's times like this I love
being part of this family.

08:51.330 --> 08:54.533
We're sitting by the pool
with Amber and Scott.

08:54.600 --> 08:57.970
Let's see if he falls
for this little nugget. Scott.

09:02.909 --> 09:06.479
Are my ears having a laugh or did
Chloe say she wants a threesome?

09:06.545 --> 09:08.814
I always knew she wanted my chopper.

09:08.881 --> 09:12.251
Happy to oblige, though.
If you can handle it, kid.

09:13.452 --> 09:16.088
Scott, Marnie and Chloe are
whispering by the pool

09:16.155 --> 09:19.191
and I'm sure I just heard
the word threesome mentioned.

09:21.560 --> 09:24.330
Calm down, Scotty.
Chloe was only joking.

09:24.397 --> 09:26.832
I think she was anyway. As if.

09:36.208 --> 09:39.045
I am so excited
for tonight, you know?

09:39.111 --> 09:42.214
It's our first night in Magaluf
and I can't wait to get on it.

09:42.281 --> 09:43.883
Charlotte might not be here,

09:43.950 --> 09:46.719
but these girls know
how to have a good time.

09:46.786 --> 09:48.387
I'm proper buzzing, like.

09:48.454 --> 09:50.323
It's gonna be a good night,
isn't it?

09:50.389 --> 09:53.459
I need to find out if Chloe's
got any feelings for Scott.

09:53.526 --> 09:55.861
I like him, but I'm not
cracking on if it means

09:55.928 --> 09:58.030
another fight between me and Chloe.

09:59.799 --> 10:03.302
He's out the window, but I'm not
gonna lie, I know he's gonna flirt.

10:03.369 --> 10:06.572
Chloe's gonna stay away from Scott,
thank fuck for that.

10:06.639 --> 10:10.176
Have you been speaking or anything?
Well, last time

10:10.242 --> 10:12.878
we left off and it was good.

10:12.945 --> 10:17.616
Me and Scott get on, so who knows,
there could be a holiday romance.

10:17.683 --> 10:19.418
I'm gonna see what happens.

10:19.485 --> 10:22.121
But we left on good terms,
so I don't see why not.

10:25.891 --> 10:29.128
It's mad, four single lads.
Four single lads and a gay lad.

10:29.195 --> 10:31.330
I'm not looking forward to going out

10:31.397 --> 10:34.200
with you on the pull.
It's gonna be an alpha male fest.

10:34.266 --> 10:36.402
I left my boyfriend
back in Newcastle

10:36.469 --> 10:37.703
and I miss him a lot.

10:37.770 --> 10:40.406
That's not gonna stop me
from having a wicked time.

10:40.473 --> 10:43.776
I've never seen single Gaz before.
I'm back!

10:43.843 --> 10:47.646
I am single, but all the Charlotte
drama's a little too raw for me.

10:47.713 --> 10:51.417
I can't tell this lot, after all the
banter I give them for not pulling.

10:51.484 --> 10:53.185
That happened, it's done.

10:53.252 --> 10:56.822
I'm gutted Charlotte's not here,
but I tried, it didn't work.

10:56.889 --> 10:59.158
Time to move on.
In Magaluf with the boys.

10:59.225 --> 11:02.028
Me and Gaz last time
didn't leave on the best of terms.

11:02.094 --> 11:04.697
We're in Magaluf
and I don't want any kick-offs

11:04.764 --> 11:06.665
let's hope the past doesn't come up.

11:06.732 --> 11:09.535
All right, Scott? Family night?
You got Chantelle?

11:09.602 --> 11:12.505
I haven't banged her yet,
it could be on the cards.

11:12.571 --> 11:15.541
Yeah, man. Chantelle still hasn't
had a go on my chopper.

11:15.608 --> 11:17.610
She must be scared
of fucking heights.

11:17.676 --> 11:18.878
And depths...

11:18.944 --> 11:21.881
What's happening with Chloe?
She's looking all right.

11:21.947 --> 11:23.949
I haven't really spoken to her.

11:24.016 --> 11:27.586
Me and Chloe are close
and I do really, really like her,

11:27.653 --> 11:32.024
but we haven't spoken and tonight
I wanna have a laugh with her.

11:34.960 --> 11:38.731
All right, so, yous, there's
something that I haven't told you.

11:38.798 --> 11:42.268
I've got something to tell the girls
I just hope they take it well.

11:42.334 --> 11:45.805
It's, like, a big deal
that's happened in my life. What?

11:45.871 --> 11:48.641
I hate it when Marnie
springs a surprise on us.

11:48.707 --> 11:51.410
What now? Is she engaged
to some prick again?

11:51.477 --> 11:53.446
Don't treat us any differently.

11:53.512 --> 11:56.949
I am so nervous about this.
Deep breath.

11:57.016 --> 11:58.584
(takes a deep breath)

12:01.987 --> 12:05.958
Erm, well, I recently came out
to my family as bisexual.

12:07.927 --> 12:11.797
Well, I think we kinda
already knew that anyway.

12:11.864 --> 12:13.499
Marnie likes boys and girls.

12:13.566 --> 12:17.103
So do I, but I'm not bi.
Just mortal and horny, usually.

12:17.169 --> 12:20.172
Now that you're bi how would that
effect you and Aaron?

12:20.239 --> 12:25.578
Nothing like... Me being bisexual
doesn't mean I fancy Aaron less.

12:25.644 --> 12:29.281
I like girls and boys,
but it's Aaron I want to be with now.

12:29.348 --> 12:32.384
I need him to prove himself,
because he didn't last time.

12:32.451 --> 12:33.919
I feel like I'm kinda glad.

12:33.986 --> 12:35.187
(laughter)

12:35.254 --> 12:38.157
If it doesn't work with Scott,
we'll get mortal.

12:38.224 --> 12:40.826
If you wanna carpet munch,
you carpet munch.

12:40.893 --> 12:42.061
Do the lads know?

12:42.128 --> 12:44.830
I don't think
it's any of their business.

12:46.432 --> 12:49.068
Things with me and Aaron
are complicated enough,

12:49.135 --> 12:51.770
I'm definitely not ready
to tell him just yet.

12:55.441 --> 12:57.810
Aaron can get things
back on with Marnie.

12:57.877 --> 13:01.580
I'm just gonna enjoy my night,
I'm not gonna think about Marnie.

13:01.647 --> 13:04.416
Just gonna enjoy my fucking night
and get pissed.

13:04.483 --> 13:06.385
I dunno what's going on with Marnie.

13:06.452 --> 13:10.389
I do know I don't wanna pull
anyone else and I hope she doesn't.

13:18.063 --> 13:21.200
Tonight is gonna be wicked.
I've got yous a present.

13:21.267 --> 13:23.669
I'm gonna go out
and get fucking on it.

13:23.736 --> 13:27.106
Magaluf!
(all) Magaluf!

13:27.173 --> 13:30.409
We're all doing shots
then Holly gobs hers first.

13:30.476 --> 13:32.344
And another.

13:32.411 --> 13:33.946
Do another one.

13:34.013 --> 13:35.281
And another.

13:35.347 --> 13:38.050
Shit. She's getting on it tonight.

13:38.117 --> 13:39.485
Let's go!

13:44.590 --> 13:47.860
Marnie think she looks sexy.
I think she looks like an idiot.

13:47.927 --> 13:49.495
Such a buzzkill.

13:51.263 --> 13:53.999
I feel like I've just been
kicked in the stomach.

13:54.066 --> 13:55.467
Fucking little slag!

13:55.534 --> 13:57.636
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

14:00.005 --> 14:00.206
.

14:02.708 --> 14:02.942
.

14:03.008 --> 14:05.277
'This part contains
more strong language,

14:05.344 --> 14:07.213
sex talk and violent behaviour,

14:07.279 --> 14:09.715
so, if this is not for you,
you best turn over.'

14:10.816 --> 14:14.620
Tonight is the first night out
in Maga, we've just got to Capitol,

14:14.687 --> 14:17.389
this place is bouncing.
Bring on the first night.

14:19.592 --> 14:24.263
Tonight is the first night and
everyone knows it's a family night.

14:24.330 --> 14:25.864
What could possibly go wrong?

14:30.135 --> 14:34.173
I know I'm not the brightest star,
but I'm sure Scott is flirting.

14:38.877 --> 14:41.814
What are Scott and Chloe playing at?
Are they flirting?

14:41.880 --> 14:43.282
I just told her I liked him.

14:48.787 --> 14:51.257
First Scott was flirting with us
and now Marty.

14:51.323 --> 14:55.694
Someone needs to get the fire
extinguisher out, cos I am smoking.

15:03.002 --> 15:06.138
Chloe looks wicked tonight,
and I wanna get with her.

15:06.205 --> 15:08.974
But she's got history with Scott
and it pisses me off

15:09.041 --> 15:11.110
when she fucking flirts with him.

15:14.913 --> 15:16.882
I wouldn't do that.

15:20.586 --> 15:23.522
I am so glad that Chloe
has pinky promised us

15:23.589 --> 15:27.526
that nothing is gonna happen with
Scott cos I do really like her.

15:35.334 --> 15:37.169
I know this might be shit stirring,

15:37.236 --> 15:40.205
but I need to find out more about
this threesome banter.

15:48.747 --> 15:51.884
Gary, will you shut your mouth?
The threesome was a joke.

15:58.557 --> 16:00.459
Hang on, am I hearing this right?

16:00.526 --> 16:03.529
Chloe has asked Marnie and Scott
for a threesome?

16:03.595 --> 16:04.596
What the fuck?

16:04.663 --> 16:07.199
What's Scott said?

16:08.734 --> 16:11.637
Scott was saying he'd have
a threesome with me and Chloe

16:11.704 --> 16:14.239
me and Chloe were agreeing,
going "Yeah, yeah."

16:14.306 --> 16:15.641
Seeing what he would say.

16:15.708 --> 16:19.712
Chloe said she wasn't interested
in Scott. What a two-faced knacker.

16:21.880 --> 16:24.683
Whoa, Chantelle was taking this
way too seriously.

16:24.750 --> 16:26.118
She does not look happy.

16:26.185 --> 16:28.921
He didn't mean it.
Yeah, he would, though.

16:28.987 --> 16:32.791
I would have told them if Marty and
Aaron wanted a threesome with me.

16:38.864 --> 16:41.800
Me, Scott and Marnie
would never have a threesome.

16:41.867 --> 16:43.068
It was just a joke.

16:48.207 --> 16:49.842
What is Chantelle on about?

16:49.908 --> 16:52.144
I can't help it if Scott
wants a threesome.

16:52.211 --> 16:54.847
She's just jealous
cos he hasn't shagged her.

17:06.157 --> 17:08.493
Did she just say
she was gonna get with Marty?

17:08.560 --> 17:10.028
She wouldn't fucking dare.

17:10.095 --> 17:11.964
He wouldn't go near her anyway.

17:12.030 --> 17:15.134
She wants Scott's cock,
she wants Marty's cock.

17:15.200 --> 17:16.602
Whose cock does she want?

17:16.667 --> 17:19.171
She wants just cock, cock, cock.

17:19.238 --> 17:20.973
What a fucking surprise,

17:21.039 --> 17:22.741
Chantelle is kicking off again.

17:22.808 --> 17:25.210
Does this girl
ever fucking take a break?

17:27.880 --> 17:29.281
Pre-drinks are done.

17:29.348 --> 17:31.784
Let's get to BCM
and get fucking lairy.

17:41.693 --> 17:43.896
We get to the club,
the place is bouncing.

17:43.962 --> 17:46.331
Tonight is gonna be fucking wicked.

17:53.705 --> 17:56.008
You know what?
If you crack on with Scott,

17:56.074 --> 17:59.111
then I can crack on with Marty.
Two can play at that game.

18:02.481 --> 18:05.117
I made Chloe promise
she wouldn't get with Scott

18:05.184 --> 18:08.854
and I know Chantelle is only doing
this to piss Chloe off.

18:08.921 --> 18:10.856
Fuck it. I'm not gonna get involved.

18:19.832 --> 18:22.468
Me and Chloe are always up
for a bit of dry humping.

18:22.534 --> 18:26.605
But now she knows I'm bisexual,
she seems more up for it than ever.

18:26.672 --> 18:29.775
I love boogeying on down
with Marnie. I feel dead sexy.

18:29.842 --> 18:32.945
Go Chloe, go Chloe, go Chloe!

18:34.613 --> 18:37.649
Marnie thinks she looks sexy,
but she looks like an idiot.

18:37.716 --> 18:39.985
To be honest,
I can't be arsed to pull her

18:40.052 --> 18:42.955
when she's carrying on
like that with Chloe.

18:44.523 --> 18:48.660
Aaron's trying to stop us dancing
with Chloe, he's such a buzzkill.

18:48.727 --> 18:51.363
It's times like this
that I can't see us together.

18:52.164 --> 18:53.899
Marnie!

18:53.966 --> 18:55.934
Marnie!

19:02.875 --> 19:05.344
I have had
the best time ever tonight.

19:05.410 --> 19:08.146
I've got along with everyone,
I've had such a laugh.

19:08.213 --> 19:11.550
It's time to get back to the villa
and continue the party.

19:24.329 --> 19:25.898
They were talking earlier,

19:25.964 --> 19:28.500
how Scott was a flirt
and then Scott was like,

19:28.567 --> 19:31.303
"We were on about a threesome,
they were all for it."

19:31.370 --> 19:33.372
They didn't mention that before.

19:33.438 --> 19:36.542
At the end of the day,
does she want Marty, or Scott?

19:36.608 --> 19:39.278
I'm fuming with Chloe.
Why's she so two-faced?

19:39.344 --> 19:42.881
If she wanted to go there,
why didn't she just say?

19:42.948 --> 19:44.616
I'm just gonna stay clear.

19:44.683 --> 19:48.287
All I'm saying, be real. Chloe
should have said, "Chantelle,

19:48.353 --> 19:49.888
this is how is it with Scott."

19:49.955 --> 19:53.158
I've had a few drinks and Chantelle
is banging on about Chloe.

19:53.225 --> 19:55.827
All I can think about
is what I know about Chloe.

19:55.894 --> 19:58.564
(talking over each other)

19:58.630 --> 20:00.766
Before my mind can catch up
with my mouth,

20:00.832 --> 20:02.935
I've said something I shouldn't.

20:03.001 --> 20:04.903
Fucking drop the bomb now!

20:04.970 --> 20:07.973
I know what the bomb is,
it will blow up over Chloe's face.

20:08.040 --> 20:09.241
Let me drop it for you.

20:09.308 --> 20:11.543
Did I tell you about her and Kyle?

20:11.610 --> 20:13.378
Is that what we're talking about?

20:13.445 --> 20:16.782
Her and Kyle when they
spent two nights together?

20:16.848 --> 20:20.052
How Chloe and Kyle
spent two nights together?

20:20.118 --> 20:21.353
Fucking hell!

20:23.188 --> 20:25.023
Chloe and Kyle together?

20:25.090 --> 20:28.727
I feel like I've literally just been
kicked in the fucking stomach.

20:31.363 --> 20:33.732
I can feel the rage
building up inside of us.

20:33.799 --> 20:35.968
I just wanna kick
something or someone.

20:38.303 --> 20:39.905
Holly, Holly, Holly!

20:39.972 --> 20:41.740
I need to get out of this taxi now.

20:41.807 --> 20:43.375
(screams)

20:43.442 --> 20:47.479
Fucking hell, apparently Chloe has
been shagging Chloe's ex, Kyle.

20:47.546 --> 20:51.016
(screams) Fucking little slag!

20:54.286 --> 20:58.090
Out of nowhere, the taxi stops and
all I can hear is Holly going mental.

20:58.156 --> 20:59.758
(Holly screams)

20:59.825 --> 21:01.893
I didn't know they were shagging.

21:01.960 --> 21:03.929
I can't be around this lot tonight.

21:03.996 --> 21:06.131
I need to go away
and try and calm down.

21:06.198 --> 21:08.300
I'll deal with this shit
in the morning.

21:08.367 --> 21:09.568
(screaming)

21:09.635 --> 21:13.905
Shit. Thanks, Chantelle.
I knew Holly would go radge.

21:13.972 --> 21:16.375
I didn't think she'd go this mental.

21:16.441 --> 21:18.143
Holly is going absolutely nuts.

21:18.210 --> 21:21.313
I wanna speak to Chloe
and get the lowdown on Australia.

21:27.919 --> 21:31.023
What the... That is the funniest
thing I've seen in my life.

21:31.089 --> 21:32.224
Was that Gary?

21:32.290 --> 21:34.292
I've been shagging Kyle
in Australia?

21:34.359 --> 21:36.795
Gary, you're a fucking lying prick.

21:43.735 --> 21:46.304
Get back to the villa
and Holly had just took off.

21:46.371 --> 21:48.140
No-one knows where she's gone.

21:48.206 --> 21:49.908
To be honest, I don't blame her.

21:49.975 --> 21:53.812
She's just found out her friend
has been shagging her ex boyfriend.

21:56.648 --> 21:59.718
I can't believe Kyle...
What's his name? Fucking Gary.

22:07.292 --> 22:09.127
Fucking Gary.

22:11.963 --> 22:14.066
Gary, come here.
I wanna speak to you.

22:14.132 --> 22:17.803
I'm not letting that lying dickhead
get away with this anymore.

22:17.869 --> 22:20.972
This needs to be sorted.
God knows what Holly thinks of us.

22:21.039 --> 22:24.443
You sat there, tried to gossip,
said I shagged Kyle

22:24.509 --> 22:26.812
when I'm not.
Me and Kyle are just friends.

22:26.878 --> 22:29.347
In Australia you were banging Kyle.
I wasn't!

22:29.414 --> 22:32.617
I can't believe people think
I've actually had sex with Kyle.

22:32.684 --> 22:35.487
You know what that is?
Gossips and fish-wives.

22:35.554 --> 22:36.722
That's a proper lie.

22:36.788 --> 22:39.758
For you to sit here
and shit stir about that.

22:39.825 --> 22:41.226
It makes me look like a mug.

22:41.293 --> 22:43.729
I've had enough of Gary.
He's not listening.

22:43.795 --> 22:46.865
I just hope Holly doesn't believe
him, cos it's not true.

22:50.368 --> 22:53.572
It should never have been me
and Gary that dropped that bomb.

22:53.638 --> 22:58.076
I totally regret it, but at the end
of the day I was fuming with Chloe.

22:58.143 --> 23:00.479
Now I feel so sorry for Holly.

23:02.247 --> 23:05.217
Marnie's in the shag pad with Chloe,
Chantelle's in bed,

23:05.283 --> 23:08.386
everything's OK for tonight.
I'm in the shag pad with them.

23:08.453 --> 23:11.056
We'll sort it out tomorrow.
Let's go.

23:23.435 --> 23:25.504
I just don't feel
like I trust anyone.

23:25.570 --> 23:28.940
If this is true, I'll never speak
to Chloe again. I can't bear it.

23:29.007 --> 23:31.810
Being a gentleman,
I let Marnie go in front of us.

23:33.245 --> 23:34.880
I think I might love him.

23:34.946 --> 23:37.716
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

23:39.484 --> 23:39.684
.

23:42.187 --> 23:42.387
.

23:54.199 --> 23:56.935
I've been away and I've had time
to clear my head.

23:57.002 --> 23:59.604
I can't believe
what I heard last night.

23:59.671 --> 24:04.109
One of my best friends and my ex have
apparently been sleeping together.

24:04.176 --> 24:06.878
If this is true,
I will never speak to Chloe again.

24:06.945 --> 24:09.748
I wanna know the truth.

24:17.189 --> 24:18.356
(whispers) Chloe.

24:21.726 --> 24:24.162
It's really early
and Holly's just woken us up.

24:24.229 --> 24:25.997
I need to talk to you.

24:27.365 --> 24:30.902
Shit. If she believes what Gary
said, she's gonna go radge.

24:30.969 --> 24:33.438
I need to tell her
my side of the story.

24:36.308 --> 24:39.144
Nothing has ever, ever happened
between me and Kyle.

24:39.211 --> 24:42.047
Me and him have never, ever had sex.
I swear to God.

24:42.113 --> 24:45.016
Before I could even ask her,
Chloe denied everything.

24:45.083 --> 24:47.285
And it's making us really upset.

24:47.352 --> 24:49.287
I dunno what to believe.

24:50.589 --> 24:55.026
(sobbing)
I just dunno what I believe.

24:55.093 --> 24:57.329
I need to make sure
Holly believes it.

24:57.395 --> 24:59.598
I would never, ever shag Kyle.

24:59.664 --> 25:02.968
Holly is my best friend and
I would never go against girl code.

25:03.034 --> 25:06.137
You've never got with Kyle?
Me and Kyle have not kissed.

25:06.204 --> 25:09.708
We've cuddled, but we've not kissed
and we've not shagged.

25:10.809 --> 25:12.210
I'm not being funny,

25:12.277 --> 25:15.413
even if me and Kyle were together,
how would Gary know?

25:16.848 --> 25:20.518
I've done everything I can
to convince her it's not true.

25:20.585 --> 25:22.287
I just hope she believes us.

25:24.689 --> 25:26.925
Honestly, Holly, nothing's going on.

25:26.992 --> 25:28.126
I can't even bear it.

25:28.193 --> 25:31.029
I just don't feel
like I don't trust anyone.

25:31.096 --> 25:32.664
You can't trust anyone.

25:32.731 --> 25:34.733
I genuinely do believe you.

25:34.799 --> 25:38.336
I do. Because I don't think
you would do that. I really don't.

25:38.403 --> 25:41.940
I have to believe that one of my best
friends wouldn't do that to us.

25:42.007 --> 25:44.142
I would never do that
to any of my friends.

25:44.209 --> 25:46.544
I will have a word...
I can honestly sit here,

25:46.611 --> 25:49.648
like, people might think,
oh, you're a mug, it did happen,

25:49.714 --> 25:52.317
but I genuinely do believe you. I do.

25:52.384 --> 25:54.786
I'm glad that I came back
and spoke to Chloe.

25:54.853 --> 25:58.556
I'm determined to enjoy myself and
I'm not gonna let this bring us down.

25:58.623 --> 26:00.592
Let's cuddle.

26:02.894 --> 26:05.530
Holly believes me
and not that shit stirrer, Gary.

26:05.597 --> 26:08.366
Thank fuck for that,
she is one of my closest friends

26:08.433 --> 26:12.203
and I wouldn't wanna lose her
over a rumour what's not true.

26:27.686 --> 26:29.454
Girls are fucking idiots.

26:29.521 --> 26:32.724
Look how nice it was,
all of us getting along

26:32.791 --> 26:34.926
and they fucked it up last night.

26:34.993 --> 26:37.329
Last night was a fucking disaster.

26:37.395 --> 26:41.700
Holly fucked off cos Gary reckons
Kyle shagged Chloe in Australia.

26:41.766 --> 26:44.703
Wow. Magaluf is gonna be
fucking mint.

26:44.769 --> 26:47.939
She had no idea
and she found out last night.

26:48.006 --> 26:51.109
And she just lost her shit.
I can't see Chloe banging Kyle.

26:51.176 --> 26:53.144
It's bullshit.

26:53.211 --> 26:55.814
This Kyle and Chloe thing
has caused a lot of shit.

26:55.880 --> 26:58.383
Let's put it under the carpet
and move on.

27:04.956 --> 27:08.426
I can't believe last night.
I thought it would be a good night.

27:08.493 --> 27:11.930
I fell asleep with Marnie in the
shag pad after me and Holly spoke.

27:11.997 --> 27:15.700
I need to feel all right about it.
I'm relieve Holly believes us.

27:15.767 --> 27:19.004
So, Holly come up...
The light was up.

27:19.070 --> 27:20.772
And was crying her eyes out like,

27:20.839 --> 27:23.541
"Have you had sex with Kyle?"
That's laughable.

27:23.608 --> 27:26.878
I hope Holly doesn't believe
that Chloe would shag Kyle.

27:26.945 --> 27:29.814
She might be daft, but she wouldn't
do that to a friend.

27:29.881 --> 27:31.983
Gary has been shit stirring a lot.

27:32.050 --> 27:34.519
I can't be bothered for today.
Last night...

27:34.586 --> 27:38.056
We had a good night
and then that shit kicked off

27:38.123 --> 27:40.759
I wanna forget about last night.

27:40.825 --> 27:43.261
I hope Marty doesn't believe
I shagged Kyle

27:43.328 --> 27:44.829
cos he might not get with us.

27:44.896 --> 27:47.832
If she believes you,
that's the main thing.

27:53.671 --> 27:56.441
Right, fuck last night.
Fuck the drama.

27:56.508 --> 27:59.811
We need to spend the day together
and get bouncy at the beach.

28:04.516 --> 28:06.918
What I need to get back
in to the holiday spirit

28:06.985 --> 28:10.622
is a family day at the beach.
Let's get out of here.

28:10.688 --> 28:13.458
There's a power cut.
Fuck's sake, we're locked in.

28:13.525 --> 28:15.660
What the fuck?
The gate won't open

28:15.727 --> 28:17.562
because there's no fucking leccy.

28:17.629 --> 28:21.166
Anna, man. Whip the batteries out
your vibrator and sort it out.

28:21.232 --> 28:23.601
Are we climbing over a fucking wall?
Oh, wow.

28:23.668 --> 28:26.838
Being a gentlemen, I let Marnie
go in front of us.

28:26.905 --> 28:27.939
Aaron!

28:28.006 --> 28:30.108
Every cloud and that.

28:32.811 --> 28:35.680
Off to the beach and I bet
there's loads of bucking

28:35.747 --> 28:38.216
and crabs, if you know what I mean.

28:42.754 --> 28:43.855
We're at the beach!

28:43.922 --> 28:46.524
Oh, that feels nice.

28:46.591 --> 28:48.259
This is my idea of a perfect day.

28:48.326 --> 28:50.595
Hit the beach,
what more do you want?

28:55.266 --> 28:56.868
Sexy!

29:02.607 --> 29:06.077
Me and Aaron haven't had the chance
to spend any time together

29:06.144 --> 29:08.680
and I really miss
spending time with him.

29:08.746 --> 29:12.217
Look at them...
I love Marnie and Aaron together.

29:12.283 --> 29:15.520
I'm not gonna lie,
they are couple goals.

29:20.291 --> 29:22.927
I love spending time with Marnie
when it's just us.

29:22.994 --> 29:25.196
Even though she did spot
a bogey on my nose,

29:25.263 --> 29:27.932
that's the girl I wanna be with.

29:27.999 --> 29:30.568
Aaron!

29:40.111 --> 29:42.981
I finally get the chance
to talk to Chloe by herself.

29:43.047 --> 29:46.518
I'm a little bit nervous
to tell her how I feel.

29:46.584 --> 29:49.287
I've been trying hard
to talk about feelings.

29:49.354 --> 29:51.523
I know, you hate
talking about feelings.

29:51.589 --> 29:53.124
I like you a bit.
Do you?

29:53.191 --> 29:55.660
I can't believe
Marty's told us he likes us.

29:55.727 --> 29:58.596
I know how hard it is for him
to talk about feelings.

29:58.663 --> 30:00.064
I can't stop smiling.

30:00.131 --> 30:03.001
I'm happy that you said that.
I do get really shy.

30:03.067 --> 30:05.203
I just want you to be truthful.

30:05.270 --> 30:07.405
I know,
cos I didn't like being honest...

30:07.472 --> 30:10.308
Why?
Cos you'll make us look like a divvy.

30:10.375 --> 30:11.943
How would I do that?

30:12.010 --> 30:15.079
I've never been this honest
with a bird in my life.

30:15.146 --> 30:18.216
I'm taking a chance with Chloe,
she better not let us down.

30:18.283 --> 30:19.984
What about tonight then?

30:20.051 --> 30:21.886
I'm not gonna pull anyone.

30:21.953 --> 30:25.290
Why?
Cos I wanna try and...

30:25.356 --> 30:28.126
...I wanna see... I'm getting shy.
I hate doing this.

30:31.696 --> 30:35.733
(laughter)

30:35.800 --> 30:38.536
I can't believe it...
I can't believe...

30:38.603 --> 30:42.540
He's being so lovely and no boy's
ever spoken to us like this.

30:42.607 --> 30:43.908
I've got butterflies.

30:43.975 --> 30:47.145
All right. Turn round.
Me? Why?

30:47.212 --> 30:48.613
It's a present.
Go on then.

30:48.680 --> 30:52.016
Please be diamond rings,
or chicken nuggets. I don't care.

30:52.083 --> 30:53.585
Don't look.
I won't.

30:56.187 --> 30:59.524
I never though writing two initials
would be so hard.

30:59.591 --> 31:02.393
I nearly forgot
her fucking second name.

31:03.628 --> 31:05.863
MM, Chloe Ferry.

31:05.930 --> 31:07.932
Do you even know my second name?

31:07.999 --> 31:10.935
I can't believe Marty's
put my initials in the sand.

31:11.002 --> 31:12.537
I think I might love him.

31:12.604 --> 31:15.340
It's out in the open.
Good.

31:15.406 --> 31:16.641
Do you wanna shag?

31:26.351 --> 31:29.420
I'm absolutely mortal.
I love you. I'm obsessed with you.

31:29.487 --> 31:32.090
It's always me
who has to move things on.

31:32.156 --> 31:33.658
Chicken fucking nuggets?

31:33.725 --> 31:37.362
Fuck off! I am fucking done.

31:37.428 --> 31:40.198
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

31:41.966 --> 31:42.166
.

31:44.669 --> 31:44.902
j

31:44.969 --> 31:47.338
'Warning, Geordie Shore
is very full-on,

31:47.405 --> 31:50.775
so do not watch if you can't handle
the bad language and sex talk,

31:50.842 --> 31:53.344
including some nudity throughout.'

32:00.752 --> 32:04.922
It was really nice. I've got
butterflies after talking to Marty.

32:04.989 --> 32:08.559
I just cannot wait to spend the
night with him and see what happens.

32:08.626 --> 32:10.862
I wanna spend more time
with you and stuff.

32:10.928 --> 32:13.498
That's what he said.
I was getting embarrassed.

32:13.564 --> 32:15.700
I was shy.
I couldn't look him in the eyes.

32:15.767 --> 32:18.269
I was looking down
and he was as well.

32:18.336 --> 32:21.205
We were both embarrassed,
that must mean something.

32:24.776 --> 32:27.078
I think I might.
I'm feeling dead horny.

32:27.145 --> 32:28.846
I think he wants to, to be honest.

32:28.913 --> 32:31.816
If you really do like Marty,
you need to fuck Scott off

32:31.883 --> 32:33.785
and not flirt with him.

32:33.851 --> 32:36.120
It's fine, Chloe being loved up
with Marty,

32:36.187 --> 32:39.324
but I know her well. Once she's
had a drink she can't help it.

32:39.390 --> 32:41.926
I'm not saying this
cos of the thing with Scott.

32:41.993 --> 32:44.295
I'm not taking any advice
from Chantelle.

32:44.362 --> 32:46.964
After she tried
to drop us in it with Kyle,

32:47.031 --> 32:49.500
she should be grateful
I'm talking to her.

32:49.567 --> 32:53.137
Marnie, aren't you gonna be in the
shag pad? You and Aaron look cosy.

32:53.204 --> 32:55.373
We're very cosy, but we all know

32:55.440 --> 32:58.343
if we go to the shag pad
it will be me influencing it.

32:58.409 --> 33:00.812
Tonight's the night
I hope Aaron makes a move.

33:00.878 --> 33:03.648
I fancy him, but he needs
to put in a bit more effort

33:03.715 --> 33:05.249
if he wants us to get with him.

33:05.316 --> 33:08.986
Buzzing for tonight. We've
been at the beach, it's been wicked.

33:09.053 --> 33:12.123
I think tonight's gonna be good.
I can't wait.

33:12.190 --> 33:13.591
I am so excited.

33:17.695 --> 33:21.699
Looks like it's me and you, kid. Been
a while since we've been on the pull.

33:21.766 --> 33:23.735
It's been a while!

33:23.801 --> 33:25.770
Aaron, Marns?

33:25.837 --> 33:29.574
Aye, tonight I reckon. Me and Marnie
had a wicked time at the beach.

33:29.640 --> 33:31.743
Maybe tonight's the night
I make a move.

33:31.809 --> 33:33.678
I'm ready, boys. Dunno about yous.

33:33.745 --> 33:36.748
Yep.
Let's go.

33:39.851 --> 33:42.820
Everybody listen, we've had
a naughty day at the beach,

33:42.887 --> 33:45.923
let's have a naughty night out
and get berserk.

33:45.990 --> 33:48.760
(cheering)

33:48.826 --> 33:50.561
I'm dying for some peeve

33:50.628 --> 33:54.632
and the only thing
what's on my mind is getting mortal.

34:09.880 --> 34:13.451
I am well up for tonight.
Let's get in the club and get on it.

34:15.520 --> 34:17.455
To a good night!

34:26.931 --> 34:30.067
Marty's been getting stiffies.
That turned us right on.

34:31.068 --> 34:35.806
I hope he was thinking about me.
I'll make sure he gets a stiffy.

34:35.873 --> 34:38.109
Make love? Howay, Chloe.

34:38.176 --> 34:41.279
I just wanna get you naked
and do things in that shag pad.

34:53.190 --> 34:54.859
I'm like fucking Cupid me.

34:54.926 --> 34:57.929
I'll get Aaron and Marnie together,
even if it kills us.

35:04.535 --> 35:08.473
Don't be a pussy. It's not like you
haven't pulled Marnie before.

35:12.844 --> 35:15.413
Nathan's right.
I need to seal the deal tonight.

35:15.480 --> 35:18.883
If I don't I might lose her
and I don't want that to happen.

35:27.024 --> 35:30.328
Aaron straight away comes over,
goes straight in for the kiss,

35:30.394 --> 35:33.164
no chat up lines,
no compliments, no nothing.

35:39.103 --> 35:41.172
Marnie, why you making it difficult?

35:41.239 --> 35:44.509
I thought you wanted to pull us?
What the fuck is up with her?

35:51.549 --> 35:54.418
I've spotted this naughty
blonde thing in the corner,

35:54.485 --> 35:58.689
I might ask her if she wants to come
back to mine and see my pet eel.

36:05.763 --> 36:09.333
Scott's pulled a random and the
girls did tell us what he's like.

36:09.400 --> 36:12.069
I'm just gonna let him crack on.

36:18.009 --> 36:20.545
Scotty is necking off
with a random blonde girl,

36:20.611 --> 36:24.315
but I couldn't give a fuck, cos me
and Marty are gonna make sweet love.

36:39.931 --> 36:43.768
Scott's pulled, Marty's going on
about when I'm gonna pull.

36:43.834 --> 36:46.504
Last time I was with these lot
I was with Charlotte.

36:46.571 --> 36:48.205
I'll be ready when I'm ready.

36:58.249 --> 37:02.153
I'm checking in with Marty about
Chloe, I do think they're cute.

37:10.928 --> 37:12.997
I hope so, Holly. That's the plan.

37:13.064 --> 37:16.000
But you can always jump in
if Chloe goes radge.

37:18.069 --> 37:19.170
Am I seeing things?

37:19.236 --> 37:21.939
Marty looks like
he's flirting with Holly.

37:22.006 --> 37:23.874
I need to get to the bottom of this.

37:29.013 --> 37:31.449
Back off, big tits, he's mine.

37:35.319 --> 37:37.622
Oh, for fuck's sake, Chloe.

37:37.688 --> 37:40.458
Yes, me and Marty are getting close.
As friends.

37:40.524 --> 37:42.927
But Chloe's so paranoid,
she can't see that.

37:50.401 --> 37:53.404
If Chloe's been telling me the truth
about her and Kyle,

37:53.471 --> 37:56.173
then she should know
there's nothing going on.

37:56.240 --> 37:58.509
Two people can
just be friends you know.

38:05.516 --> 38:07.284
Scott, Scott, Scott, Scott!

38:07.351 --> 38:09.120
Tonight's been wicked.

38:09.186 --> 38:13.324
Now we just need to get back to the
villa and get Chloe in the shag pad.

38:14.425 --> 38:17.228
That little piece of pull
isn't coming back to villa,

38:17.294 --> 38:19.263
what a liberty. But I tell you what,

38:19.330 --> 38:22.867
it won't be long before half of
Magaluf is swinging on my chopper.

38:36.714 --> 38:40.284
I'm absolutely mortal and my head
is all over the place about Marty.

38:40.351 --> 38:44.088
I need some thinking time
and I think best when I'm naked.

38:52.229 --> 38:54.732
When we get back,
we're all actually friends.

38:54.799 --> 38:56.600
Where the fuck is Chloe?

39:01.005 --> 39:04.842
I need to speak to Marty,
cos I'm really annoyed and confused.

39:04.909 --> 39:06.610
Why is Marty flirting with Holly

39:06.677 --> 39:08.846
when he wants
to get me in the shag pad?

39:11.215 --> 39:13.784
Can I have, I've put my food...
No!

39:13.851 --> 39:16.187
Here we go. What the fuck
have I done now?

39:16.253 --> 39:19.023
Probably nowt. I can't handle her
when she's mortal.

39:19.090 --> 39:20.958
Come here! I'm not gonna kick off.

39:21.025 --> 39:23.961
I'm gonna handle it like
the mature, classy lady I am.

39:24.028 --> 39:28.332
This is... This is...
This is acceptable is it?

39:28.399 --> 39:32.570
Here's Holly. It's not acceptable.

39:32.636 --> 39:34.638
What the fuck
is Chloe going on about?

39:34.705 --> 39:36.440
I'm not flirting with Holly.

39:36.507 --> 39:40.411
At least she doesn't go radge at us
after a few too many peevies.

39:41.312 --> 39:44.582
I just wish you were
like you were in the daytime

39:44.648 --> 39:47.918
in the night time.
You just turn in to a fucking mess.

39:47.985 --> 39:52.690
Through the day you're mint. You're
the type of person I would marry.

39:52.757 --> 39:56.627
Hang on, did he just say
he would marry us? Eh?

39:56.694 --> 40:00.598
Two drinks later you just turn in to
this fucking radgie fuck.

40:00.664 --> 40:04.168
How could he say he would marry us
when he was flirting with Holly?

40:04.235 --> 40:06.003
He doesn't like us. He's a liar.

40:06.070 --> 40:08.005
You don't even fancy us.

40:08.072 --> 40:10.341
Of course I do.
You don't.

40:10.407 --> 40:12.510
Chloe, what do you want us
to fucking do?

40:14.912 --> 40:17.948
I cannot work out what's going on
in that lass's head.

40:18.015 --> 40:21.685
One second she's sound and the next,
she's going on like a pure radgie.

40:21.752 --> 40:24.021
I cannot be arsed with this like.

40:24.088 --> 40:26.924
Nah. Crack on.

40:29.393 --> 40:32.329
(slurred speech)

40:32.396 --> 40:33.531
You're a liar.

40:33.597 --> 40:34.732
Fuck off then.

40:34.799 --> 40:36.534
I don't care.
Fuck off then.

40:36.600 --> 40:37.935
What the fuck was that?

40:39.203 --> 40:40.704
Chicken fucking nuggets?

40:40.771 --> 40:42.039
What you doing?

40:42.106 --> 40:44.942
Is Chloe bouncing
chicken nuggets off Marty's face?

40:45.009 --> 40:46.677
That's her favourite food, man.

40:46.744 --> 40:48.746
She must be pissed off, or pissed.

40:48.813 --> 40:51.882
Fucking (indistinct),
you fat, little slag.

40:51.949 --> 40:54.885
Marty, Marty, Marty, don't.

40:54.952 --> 40:57.488
...on my fucking face and that.

40:57.555 --> 40:59.290
How fucking dare she?

40:59.356 --> 41:02.193
Why was I even thinking
of getting her in the shag pad?

41:04.161 --> 41:07.765
This is getting ridiculous now.
Chloe is completely overreacting.

41:07.832 --> 41:11.502
As far as I'm concerned, Marty
has not flirted with me one bit.

41:11.569 --> 41:13.337
How can she do that? How can she...

41:13.404 --> 41:14.605
Marty, stay outside.

41:14.672 --> 41:16.607
Really? Marty get up to the bedroom,

41:16.674 --> 41:18.976
I am taking you away
from the situation.

41:19.043 --> 41:21.979
I'm going to sleep.
I've had enough of this place.

41:22.046 --> 41:23.547
Fucking hell!
Chill out.

41:23.614 --> 41:28.185
I am fucking done with her.
She is not worth all this earache.

41:33.691 --> 41:35.426
Aaron gets us so frustrated.

41:35.492 --> 41:37.761
He can't be bothered
to properly pull us.

41:37.828 --> 41:39.697
Even after sticking the lips on us.

41:39.763 --> 41:42.933
It's times like this I feel like
giving up on him for good.

41:43.000 --> 41:44.368
(groans)

41:46.871 --> 41:50.107
I need to check on Marnie cos
she's gone AWOL since we got back.

41:50.174 --> 41:52.610
I don't understand
why she didn't want us.

41:52.676 --> 41:54.678
I don't know what her problem is.

41:54.745 --> 41:56.347
We don't get on, do we?

41:56.413 --> 41:58.449
We don't get on?
No.

41:58.515 --> 42:01.385
Aaron needs to prove to us
that I'm more than a random

42:01.452 --> 42:03.020
he can pull whenever he wants.

42:03.087 --> 42:05.856
I need commitment,
but he's not man enough to give it.

42:19.236 --> 42:21.839
I'm sick to death of Aaron
not making an effort.

42:21.906 --> 42:24.008
It's always me
who has to move things on.

42:24.074 --> 42:26.844
And he always pushes us to my limit.

42:26.911 --> 42:30.014
Cos I love you, I'm obsessed
with you. I always have been.

42:30.080 --> 42:32.216
But you're dead end, Aaron.

42:32.283 --> 42:35.219
She loves us, she's obsessed
with us, but I'm a dead end?

42:35.286 --> 42:37.788
My head's all over the place.
Fuck this.

42:37.855 --> 42:40.124
I'm a dead end. I'm a dead end.
Fuck off.

42:40.190 --> 42:42.026
Fuck off! Fuck off!

42:46.664 --> 42:49.366
Welcome to the pirate ship!

42:49.433 --> 42:53.370
Forget the Jolly Roger.
It's all about the naughty todger.

42:53.437 --> 42:56.407
Do you wanna be me girlfriend?
What the hell?

42:56.473 --> 42:58.175
Oh, shit.
What the fuck?

42:58.242 --> 43:00.244
We're going to Ibiza.

43:00.311 --> 43:02.746
Ibiza, here we come!

43:02.813 --> 43:03.881
Oh, my God.

43:03.948 --> 43:06.617
Marty's actually pulled a girl.
(screaming)

43:06.684 --> 43:08.886
Marnie goes to Marty,
I'm not having it.

43:08.953 --> 43:12.289
You are not boyfriend material.
We're not friends anymore.

43:12.356 --> 43:13.757
She needs help.

43:41.452 --> 43:41.652
.
