WEBVTT

00:02.001 --> 00:04.238
I've decided to run
against you for mayor.

00:04.272 --> 00:05.239
How badly do you want
to beat Rudy Jeffries?

00:05.273 --> 00:06.474
Let me run your campaign.

00:06.507 --> 00:07.675
George, this is Presley. She
works for a beer distributor.

00:07.708 --> 00:10.278
I need to find somebody who
challenges me a little bit,

00:10.311 --> 00:11.445
which is why I was wondering if

00:11.479 --> 00:12.780
you might be free
for dinner tonight?

00:12.813 --> 00:14.415
I'm not asking you
to be my boyfriend.

00:14.448 --> 00:17.118
I was just wondering if you
could do "casual" my way?

00:17.151 --> 00:18.052
Monogamous.

00:18.086 --> 00:19.820
Yeah, I think I can do that.

00:19.853 --> 00:21.655
You know, in high school,
you had me wrapped around
your little finger.

00:21.689 --> 00:22.690
RUDY:
 Here I am

00:22.723 --> 00:23.791
16 years later.

00:23.824 --> 00:25.393
This race is far from over.

00:25.426 --> 00:26.560
We may down in votes,
but I know

00:26.594 --> 00:28.429
we will win this thing.

00:28.462 --> 00:30.264
Don't know what I'd do
without you, Lemon Breeland.

00:30.298 --> 00:32.500
Sometimes I feel
like you believe in me

00:32.533 --> 00:33.267
even more than I believe
in myself.

00:38.339 --> 00:40.408
(crowd cheering)

00:53.554 --> 00:55.156
CROWD:
Ruby, Ruby, Ruby!

00:55.189 --> 00:57.758
(all cheer)

00:57.791 --> 00:59.760
Oh, that's one more for Ruby.

00:59.793 --> 01:01.562
Oh, I'm doomed.

01:01.595 --> 01:03.164
LEMON:
No, no, no, no.

01:03.197 --> 01:04.532
I will not have that kind
of talk, all right?

01:04.565 --> 01:06.567
The mayor's race
is far from over.

01:06.600 --> 01:08.169
Lemon, on the eve of every

01:08.202 --> 01:09.670
election for the last 200 years,

01:09.703 --> 01:12.373
the Pickin' Chicken,
or one of its ancestors,

01:12.406 --> 01:14.142
has accurately predicted
the winner,

01:14.175 --> 01:15.709
and this one, oh,

01:15.743 --> 01:17.845
is picking Ruby Jeffries
every single time.

01:17.878 --> 01:20.681
All right, and somehow
I, a mere human,

01:20.714 --> 01:23.684
have conducted polls every day
that show you now in the lead.

01:23.717 --> 01:25.386
So, I'm up in the polls.

01:25.419 --> 01:27.121
Ooh!

01:27.155 --> 01:27.821
But I'm down in the poultry.

01:29.357 --> 01:30.124
That's right. I said that.

01:30.158 --> 01:31.592
(laughs)

01:31.625 --> 01:33.594
All right, listen,
all that matters

01:33.627 --> 01:34.662
is tonight's big debate, okay?

01:34.695 --> 01:36.330
You crush Ruby Jeffries

01:36.364 --> 01:37.898
and tomorrow the only choice

01:37.931 --> 01:40.334
that chicken will be involved
in is "breast or thigh."

01:40.368 --> 01:42.270
Crush.
Crush.

01:42.303 --> 01:44.505
RUBY:
Lemon? Mayor Hayes?

01:44.538 --> 01:47.741
Oh, no, now, it-it-it's Lavon.

01:47.775 --> 01:48.809
You know that.

01:48.842 --> 01:50.678
RUBY:
I know, but I thought
it might

01:50.711 --> 01:51.679
be nice to say "Mayor Hayes"

01:51.712 --> 01:53.481
since you only
have one day left to hear it.

01:53.514 --> 01:54.782
Or we have
to hear anything

01:54.815 --> 01:55.783
from you at all.

01:55.816 --> 01:57.718
I know we will all miss
the dry, scraping sound

01:57.751 --> 01:59.587
of your voice against our ears.

02:02.823 --> 02:04.225
I just wish
this would all

02:04.258 --> 02:06.827
be over with,
so we can move on

02:06.860 --> 02:08.429
to whatever's next.

02:08.461 --> 02:09.930
Yes, indeed.

02:09.963 --> 02:11.799
To whatever is next.

02:11.832 --> 02:13.334
Huh.

02:13.367 --> 02:14.302
(giggles)

02:16.337 --> 02:17.905
Oh, God, not one
of these pens works?

02:17.938 --> 02:18.906
Damn it, Dr. Hart?

02:18.939 --> 02:21.242
Why didn't you order any pens?

02:22.943 --> 02:25.246
You know, there have been
many scientific advancements

02:25.279 --> 02:26.314
since you were in school.

02:26.347 --> 02:28.749
Besides gravity,
they've discovered

02:28.782 --> 02:31.652
that women are not uniquely
adapted to order supplies,

02:31.685 --> 02:33.421
make coffee,
and answer phones.

02:34.955 --> 02:36.657
Daddy, hi.

02:36.690 --> 02:38.192
Should I come by after school
for my driving lesson?

02:38.226 --> 02:39.193
Oh, honey, not,

02:39.227 --> 02:40.528
no, not today.

02:40.561 --> 02:43.431
Yes, you said you'd
teach me to drive if I got

02:43.464 --> 02:44.932
my learner's permit.
Look, honey,

02:44.965 --> 02:46.800
to be honest,
I rolled the dice on that one.

02:46.834 --> 02:48.068
I never saw that happening.

02:48.101 --> 02:50.571
But, Daddy, I was really hoping
it be like that time when you

02:50.604 --> 02:51.872
taught me
to ride a bike.

02:51.905 --> 02:52.940
Remember that?

02:52.973 --> 02:54.975
Oh, yeah, sure, sure I do.

02:55.008 --> 02:56.877
No, you don't
because it never happened.

02:56.910 --> 02:58.546
Oh, now look at you:

02:58.579 --> 03:00.548
you feel bad
and I hate to see you

03:00.581 --> 03:02.483
feeling bad,
so teach me to drive.

03:02.516 --> 03:03.484
All right, fine, tomorrow.

03:03.517 --> 03:06.287
Right now, today
is fully committed

03:06.320 --> 03:08.589
to finding a working pen!

03:10.758 --> 03:11.992
Oh, Dr. Hart, you have

03:12.025 --> 03:13.594
to fix my dad.

03:13.627 --> 03:14.862
Ooh, I like that idea,
but I'm not a vet.

03:14.895 --> 03:16.430
I'm serious.

03:16.464 --> 03:18.299
He's crankier than usual,
plus now he's not eating

03:18.332 --> 03:20.268
and I don't even think
he sleeps.

03:20.301 --> 03:22.970
Well, that doesn't sound good.
I know, I'm really worried.

03:23.003 --> 03:24.472
All right,
I'll look into it.

03:24.505 --> 03:25.573
I'm sure he's fine though.

03:25.606 --> 03:28.742
I hope so because I'm all alone
with him at home now

03:28.776 --> 03:31.312
and I am this close
to putting him in a nuthouse.

03:31.345 --> 03:32.546
I found I can do it

03:32.580 --> 03:33.847
with one form
off the Internet.

03:33.881 --> 03:35.883
Okay.

03:35.916 --> 03:38.986
(duck quacking)

03:39.019 --> 03:40.388
(clears throat)

03:40.421 --> 03:41.789
ZOE:
Okay, I got to get going.

03:41.822 --> 03:44.458
I have to figure out
a way to give Brick an exam.

03:44.492 --> 03:45.926
I wish I knew
a race track doctor.

03:45.959 --> 03:47.395
They're used to dealing
with horse's asses.

03:47.428 --> 03:48.396
(laughs)

03:48.429 --> 03:49.397
Ah, he's fine.

03:49.430 --> 03:50.831
He just needs to get laid.

03:50.864 --> 03:53.267
Oh, good, why don't
you tell Magnolia that?

03:53.301 --> 03:54.868
It's true.

03:54.902 --> 03:56.304
Really, that's your cure
for whatever's wrong with him?

03:56.337 --> 03:57.871
Mad cow disease? Brain tumor?

03:57.905 --> 03:59.540
Laid.

03:59.573 --> 04:03.344
Well, thank you for your
nuanced analysis of the problem.

04:03.377 --> 04:05.846
But, one: Brick is dating Emily,
so I'm sure he's fine

04:05.879 --> 04:07.581
in that area. And two:

04:07.615 --> 04:09.350
is sex that important to you?

04:09.383 --> 04:11.619
I mean, if we were
to stop having sex,

04:11.652 --> 04:13.687
would you turn
into a raging lunatic?

04:13.721 --> 04:15.489
Uh...

04:15.523 --> 04:17.358
No.

04:17.391 --> 04:19.560
Okay, good.
Hmm.

04:21.094 --> 04:22.696
Because you'd start having
sex with someone else.

04:24.632 --> 04:26.934
You know, it's touching
how well you know me.

04:27.801 --> 04:29.803
(scoffs)

04:31.572 --> 04:33.607
Where the hell are
the tongue depressors?

04:33.641 --> 04:36.377
How do you run out
of cotton swabs?

04:36.410 --> 04:38.946
This whole state used to be
just fields of cotton swabs.

04:39.847 --> 04:41.382
Hey, Brick.

04:41.415 --> 04:42.850
What's up?

04:42.883 --> 04:44.952
You know, it was never like this
until you came.

04:44.985 --> 04:46.554
Right.

04:46.587 --> 04:47.788
Hey, I'm just curious.

04:47.821 --> 04:49.022
Is anything wrong?

04:49.056 --> 04:50.391
Yeah, I can never get

04:50.424 --> 04:52.493
a decent cell signal
in this place.

04:52.526 --> 04:53.827
I mean medically.

04:53.861 --> 04:56.664
Medically?

04:56.697 --> 04:58.499
Yeah, you know, it's just
that you haven't been

04:58.532 --> 05:00.067
your usual charming self,

05:00.100 --> 05:01.735
which could be normal

05:01.769 --> 05:03.371
for a man of your...

05:03.404 --> 05:04.605
A man of my what?

05:04.638 --> 05:06.006
Height.

05:07.675 --> 05:10.077
And number of birthdays

05:10.110 --> 05:12.513
to experience hypertension,
hormone imbalances,

05:12.546 --> 05:14.415
anything that can make you...
My hormones

05:14.448 --> 05:15.449
are fine, thank you

05:15.483 --> 05:16.750
very much, but if I

05:16.784 --> 05:18.452
do get pregnant,
I'll let you know.

05:18.486 --> 05:20.421
Brick, you're scaring
your daughter.

05:20.454 --> 05:22.590
And you're pissing me off.

05:22.623 --> 05:25.593
So, I am telling you, as a
doctor, to let me examine you.

05:25.626 --> 05:28.095
And I'm telling you, doctor,
the next, and only time,

05:28.128 --> 05:30.964
that you will examine me
is at my autopsy.

05:30.998 --> 05:35.469
Great, finally, something
to look forward to.

05:42.510 --> 05:44.111
All right, no matter what

05:44.144 --> 05:46.780
you just keep reminding people
that BlueBell is your home.
Yes.

05:46.814 --> 05:47.881
Okay, and now, Ruby Jeffries
hasn't set foot here

05:47.915 --> 05:49.483
in 16 years and she just

05:49.517 --> 05:50.984
waltzes in from the big city?
Oh, that's good.

05:51.018 --> 05:52.453
Say, "Big city."

05:52.486 --> 05:53.721
And wants to tell us
how to run our town?

05:53.754 --> 05:54.354
No, ma'am.

05:54.388 --> 05:56.023
No, you bury her tonight,

05:56.056 --> 05:57.458
the race is yours.

05:57.491 --> 05:58.091
You trash her.
You bear down.

05:58.125 --> 06:00.461
The "big city," bear down.

06:00.494 --> 06:01.829
Yeah, punch her
in the neck.

06:01.862 --> 06:02.730
You hook in

06:02.763 --> 06:03.764
and ground and pound.

06:03.797 --> 06:04.898
(grunts)

06:07.067 --> 06:08.736
I've been watching
mixed martial arts.

06:08.769 --> 06:09.870
I'm not proud of it.

06:10.938 --> 06:12.706
Bear down.

06:12.740 --> 06:13.741
Okay, up top.
Boom!

06:13.774 --> 06:15.142
Hey.

06:15.175 --> 06:16.477
Hey.
I'm nearly
done with work.

06:16.510 --> 06:17.545
You want to go somewhere
and get a drink?

06:17.578 --> 06:21.449
Uh, but we already
are somewhere to get a drink.

06:21.482 --> 06:23.617
I know, it's a challenge.
When you job's selling liquor,

06:23.651 --> 06:24.785
it's hard to leave work
behind for the night.

06:24.818 --> 06:26.854
Yeah, I feel like I'm asking
a stripper to go out dancing.

06:26.887 --> 06:27.821
(laughs)

06:27.855 --> 06:29.557
Nope.

06:29.590 --> 06:30.558
No.
You look

06:30.591 --> 06:33.427
very nice by the way.

06:33.461 --> 06:34.428
But, if you want
to stick around,

06:34.462 --> 06:35.429
I'm going to moderate
this debate

06:35.463 --> 06:36.630
and then we can go out after?

06:36.664 --> 06:38.031
Uh, I'll just go home
and change

06:38.065 --> 06:39.900
and wait for you; I don't
need to watch the debate.

06:39.933 --> 06:41.635
You already, uh,

06:41.669 --> 06:42.836
you already decided
who you're going to vote for?

06:42.870 --> 06:44.805
No, I just don't vote.

06:46.807 --> 06:48.175
Uh...

06:48.208 --> 06:50.644
Well, that is just not right.

06:50.678 --> 06:53.747
You having to watch George
dating right under your nose?

06:53.781 --> 06:56.584
Oh, it is okay, Daddy.
I'm just fine.

06:56.617 --> 06:57.618
You know what?

06:57.651 --> 07:00.153
You seem like you really are.

07:00.187 --> 07:01.889
Are you seeing someone?

07:01.922 --> 07:03.624
(laughs)
Of course not.

07:03.657 --> 07:04.892
(giggles)

07:04.925 --> 07:07.027
All right, well, there may

07:07.060 --> 07:08.328
be someone I may

07:08.361 --> 07:11.031
have feelings for and that's all
I have to say about that, okay?

07:11.064 --> 07:12.866
Now, hush.

07:12.900 --> 07:14.735
GEORGE:
Okay, ladies and gentlemen,
if we may.

07:14.768 --> 07:16.604
You already know
the candidates.

07:19.206 --> 07:21.141
Lavon!

07:22.943 --> 07:24.845
Thank you. Thank you.

07:24.878 --> 07:27.214
Okay, to start out, I'm going
to ask each candidate

07:27.247 --> 07:30.150
to tell us all in one sentence,

07:30.183 --> 07:33.754
"What would make you
BlueBell's best mayor?"

07:33.787 --> 07:35.823
Oh, and I would also like

07:35.856 --> 07:38.592
to ask the candidates
to keep the discourse civil.

07:38.626 --> 07:40.661
On that note,
ladies first.

07:40.694 --> 07:42.029
RUDY: Oh, uh,
thank you, George.

07:42.062 --> 07:44.632
Thank you
so much for that.

07:44.665 --> 07:46.800
Because just like you
have to prune back

07:46.834 --> 07:48.802
those lovely peach trees
that y'all have here,

07:48.836 --> 07:50.938
to bear more fruit

07:50.971 --> 07:53.240
sometimes you have
to cut back the dead wood

07:53.273 --> 07:54.975
to create new growth.

07:55.008 --> 07:56.977
(cheering)

08:00.080 --> 08:01.949
Mayor Hayes?

08:01.982 --> 08:04.685
Yeah, I'll tell you why, George.

08:04.718 --> 08:07.721
Because BlueBell is my home.

08:07.755 --> 08:09.022
Yeah, baby.
Whoo!

08:09.056 --> 08:10.157
(cheering)

08:10.190 --> 08:12.059
LEMON:
That's right, baby.

08:13.326 --> 08:15.062
Though it has been a pleasure

08:15.095 --> 08:17.665
having Ms. Jeffries
staying in it.

08:17.698 --> 08:20.133
Uh, uh, BlueBell, I mean.

08:20.167 --> 08:21.268
(laughs) Not my home.

08:21.301 --> 08:23.637
Not my home.

08:23.671 --> 08:27.140
Uh, I just mean, that
if I had to face someone

08:27.174 --> 08:29.142
for re-election,
uh, hers is a

08:29.176 --> 08:31.311
nice face...

08:31.344 --> 08:32.913
...to face.

08:34.914 --> 08:37.650
Though I haven't seen
her face much, I mean.

08:37.684 --> 08:39.219
She's been ahead
in the polls enough

08:39.251 --> 08:41.288
that I-I spent the last month
looking at her behind.

08:41.321 --> 08:42.121
(all gasp)

08:42.155 --> 08:43.155
Back.

08:43.190 --> 08:44.157
Back.

08:44.191 --> 08:45.926
Looking at her back.

08:45.959 --> 08:47.761
(laughs)

08:47.795 --> 08:50.330
Well, Mayor Hayes,
perhaps, after

08:50.363 --> 08:53.133
the election, we can
find a way to, uh,

08:53.166 --> 08:54.735
work side by side?
Ah.

08:54.768 --> 08:57.270
Hand in hand
to unite the town.

08:57.304 --> 08:59.306
Embrace our differences.

09:00.373 --> 09:03.043
Kiss... the past...

09:03.076 --> 09:04.812
good-bye.

09:06.980 --> 09:09.549
Indeed.

09:13.954 --> 09:14.688
(applause)

09:19.092 --> 09:20.761
Am I the only one

09:20.794 --> 09:23.797
that needs a cigarette
after that?

09:23.831 --> 09:26.600
I think he likes her.

09:26.634 --> 09:29.637
This does not happen
in mixed martial arts.

09:29.670 --> 09:30.971
(exhales)

09:47.788 --> 09:48.956
LAVON:
 Look, I admit I wasn't

09:48.989 --> 09:50.057
on my "A" game last night.

09:50.090 --> 09:53.226
That is because you are involved
with Ruby Jeffries.

09:53.260 --> 09:55.095
I told you I'm not.

09:55.128 --> 09:56.196
Then why don't I believe you?

09:56.229 --> 09:58.365
You may be naturally
distrustful.

09:58.398 --> 10:01.735
Due to the circumstances
of your life and whatnot.
(scoffs)

10:01.769 --> 10:03.270
The entire town saw you

10:03.303 --> 10:05.238
practically endorse her
for mayor.

10:05.272 --> 10:07.675
I-I-I was, I was being civil.

10:09.209 --> 10:11.244
Fine, then cut it out, okay?

10:11.278 --> 10:14.047
You go out,
you be seen, but you

10:14.081 --> 10:15.282
stay away from Ruby Jeffries,

10:15.315 --> 10:17.184
lest you get "civil"
with her again

10:17.217 --> 10:18.786
and hand her your mayor's hat

10:18.819 --> 10:21.121
or gavel or whatever else
comes with being mayor.

10:21.154 --> 10:23.423
It's nothing really.
It's just parking.

10:23.456 --> 10:25.125
Hey.

10:25.158 --> 10:27.194
It's your choice, all right?

10:27.227 --> 10:28.361
You either focus

10:28.395 --> 10:29.863
or you lose.

10:32.065 --> 10:33.033
O-Okay, focus.

10:33.066 --> 10:34.868
Yes. Yes.
Bear down. Okay.

10:34.902 --> 10:36.970
Okay. Got it.
Got it.

10:37.004 --> 10:39.339
All right, guys, how do
we make up for voters we lost

10:39.372 --> 10:40.974
because of last night's debacle?

10:41.008 --> 10:43.877
I made that list you wanted
of still undecided.
Great.

10:43.911 --> 10:47.247
And look what I found--
right there on the edge of town.

10:47.280 --> 10:49.116
I double-checked to see

10:49.149 --> 10:49.950
if there weren't any doors
we didn't knock on.

10:49.983 --> 10:51.218
That mobile home
wasn't there before.

10:51.251 --> 10:53.086
(shrieks) A new resident!
Oh!

10:53.120 --> 10:54.755
Awesome, okay, great.

10:54.788 --> 10:56.757
Everyone needs to take
absentee and proxy ballots

10:56.790 --> 10:58.291
in case we find
any shut-ins at all.

10:58.325 --> 11:00.427
And AnnaBeth, I need you
to go make sure that

11:00.460 --> 11:02.362
whoever lives in that trailer
votes for Lavon.

11:02.395 --> 11:04.832
Lemon, no, I'm not traipsing

11:04.865 --> 11:05.966
through the deep woods,
knocking on trailer doors.

11:05.999 --> 11:08.168
I have seen that movie,
and it is not a comic romp.

11:08.201 --> 11:09.803
(door opens)

11:09.837 --> 11:10.704
(clears throat)

11:10.738 --> 11:11.705
Wade!

11:11.739 --> 11:13.173
Uh...
Oh, you are so perfect

11:13.206 --> 11:14.474
to go search through the woods
for a redneck trailer.

11:14.507 --> 11:17.177
You'll fit right in.

11:17.210 --> 11:18.478
Listen, anyone who cares
for Lavon must scour

11:18.511 --> 11:20.180
the entire town
for additional votes.

11:20.213 --> 11:21.414
I want to help.
What can I do?

11:21.448 --> 11:24.051
Great, you make sure all of
your patients go to the polls.

11:24.084 --> 11:25.318
I can do that.

11:25.352 --> 11:26.419
Great, that's almost
two votes right there.

11:27.287 --> 11:28.321
Ha ha.

11:28.355 --> 11:29.556
Save it.

11:29.589 --> 11:31.424
I don't need any grief from
any more Breelands this week.

11:31.458 --> 11:33.360
What in the world
are you wearing?

11:35.495 --> 11:37.164
Is that Wade's shirt?

11:37.197 --> 11:39.099
(mumbles)
Is it?

11:39.132 --> 11:41.068
Wade, I told you
to do your own laundry.

11:41.101 --> 11:42.903
Stop putting your stuff in
with mine.

11:42.936 --> 11:45.305
Oh.

11:45.338 --> 11:47.407
Man, I really... hate... her.

11:50.343 --> 11:51.945
MAGNOLIA:
How am I supposed to drive

11:51.979 --> 11:53.313
with you screaming nonsense
the whole time?

11:53.346 --> 11:54.948
Ten and two, ten and two.

11:54.982 --> 11:56.016
Your hands.

11:56.049 --> 11:59.119
What do you think of when
I say 10:00 and 2:00?

11:59.152 --> 12:01.221
Geometry and P.E.
Never mind.

12:01.254 --> 12:02.923
The lesson is over.

12:02.956 --> 12:05.893
But we hardly drove anywhere.

12:05.926 --> 12:08.061
Oh, yes we did: we drove me
insane. Now, shoo, shoo.

12:08.095 --> 12:09.496
(groans)

12:09.529 --> 12:10.898
(groans)

12:10.931 --> 12:12.365
(clears throat)

12:12.399 --> 12:14.968
I'll teach her.

12:18.105 --> 12:18.906
You will?

12:18.939 --> 12:22.142
Mm-hmm, if you
let me examine you.

12:27.380 --> 12:28.816
Deal.

12:28.849 --> 12:30.951
No take-backs.

12:30.984 --> 12:32.820
(scoffs)

12:34.421 --> 12:35.823
George, listen.

12:35.856 --> 12:37.457
Lavon needs all the help
he can get.

12:37.490 --> 12:38.959
Do you know anyone
who hasn't voted yet?

12:38.992 --> 12:41.194
Uh, maybe someone that I know.

12:41.228 --> 12:43.363
A girl... uh, or a guy-- I don't
remember.

12:43.396 --> 12:44.898
All right, is this person
your girlfriend?

12:44.932 --> 12:46.333
We're dating.
Is she old enough to vote?

12:46.366 --> 12:47.400
Yes.

12:47.434 --> 12:48.401
All right, then go.

12:48.435 --> 12:49.970
Please, go, go.
Okay, okay.

12:50.003 --> 12:51.371
(phone rings)

12:51.404 --> 12:53.340
Wade, did you check out
that trailer yet?

12:53.373 --> 12:55.943
You remember my ex-wife Tansy?

12:55.976 --> 12:58.578
Oh, good Lord, well, does she
like you or hate you these days?

12:58.611 --> 13:01.381
Well, I guess we'll find out.

13:01.414 --> 13:03.216
Hey.

13:03.250 --> 13:04.952
Hey.

13:06.553 --> 13:08.989
I'll see you later.

13:09.022 --> 13:10.357
Well, hey, you.

13:10.390 --> 13:11.458
Hey, good morning.
Morning.

13:11.491 --> 13:13.861
Listen, um, I...

13:13.894 --> 13:16.864
I... I know that

13:16.897 --> 13:18.198
we are in the early,
very beginning stages

13:18.231 --> 13:19.466
of a relationship

13:19.499 --> 13:22.035
and it's great, you know;
we're finding

13:22.069 --> 13:23.904
new things about each other
each and every day,

13:23.937 --> 13:24.504
and it's like a rose
unfolding...

13:24.537 --> 13:26.006
George?

13:26.039 --> 13:27.274
How can you not vote?

13:27.307 --> 13:29.509
Oh.

13:29.542 --> 13:32.112
I just think that corporations
and big money

13:32.145 --> 13:34.014
have the system rigged,
and I don't want to play.

13:34.047 --> 13:35.849
I mean, the "every vote counts"
thing is just a way to make

13:35.883 --> 13:38.151
regular people think that
they have a say in things.

13:38.185 --> 13:39.452
No, but they do.

13:39.486 --> 13:41.021
That's the whole...
that's...

13:41.054 --> 13:42.189
That's the whole thing.

13:42.222 --> 13:43.523
All right, listen.

13:43.556 --> 13:47.127
This election right here--
it's a clear choice.

13:47.160 --> 13:48.962
All right, on one hand,
you got Ruby,

13:48.996 --> 13:50.597
who wants
to bring chain stores

13:50.630 --> 13:52.265
and make this town
into a commercial hub.

13:52.299 --> 13:53.466
And on the other hand,

13:53.500 --> 13:55.535
you got Lavon,
who believes in

13:55.568 --> 13:58.471
keeping the values that have
defined BlueBell forever.

13:58.505 --> 14:01.008
We get to choose
our future.

14:01.041 --> 14:03.143
It's what makes America
great.

14:03.176 --> 14:04.611
It's what makes America
"America."

14:04.644 --> 14:07.014
(laughs) Okay, okay,
slow down, Uncle Sam.

14:07.047 --> 14:08.281
You're so cute.

14:08.315 --> 14:09.616
(laughs)

14:09.649 --> 14:11.084
Fine, I'll vote.

14:11.118 --> 14:12.986
You will?
Mm-hmm, for you.

14:18.125 --> 14:20.961
Oh, come on.
Why's it embarrassing?

14:20.994 --> 14:22.629
Just is, I mean...

14:22.662 --> 14:24.097
Last time we talked
about it,

14:24.131 --> 14:27.400
you were all proud
of how great I was doing.

14:27.434 --> 14:28.468
And after beauty school,
Mmm.

14:28.501 --> 14:31.004
I was full of big plans
for my life and career.

14:31.038 --> 14:33.941
Then, I didn't get
any clients and now,

14:33.974 --> 14:36.676
I live in a single-wide trailer
on the edge of nowhere.

14:36.709 --> 14:38.211
Hey, it's a mobile home,
all right,

14:38.245 --> 14:41.548
and, wow, pretty damn nice one
far as I can see.

14:41.581 --> 14:46.353
You're being sweet, but it's
not exactly living the dream.

14:46.386 --> 14:48.021
(sighs) And here you are,

14:48.055 --> 14:50.223
probably about to open up
that bar of yours.

14:50.257 --> 14:54.361
Uh, yeah, hey, anyway, hey, you
had a chance to vote yet today?

14:54.394 --> 14:55.996
No, I didn't.

14:56.029 --> 14:57.397
Well, (clears throat)
it's all right.

14:57.430 --> 14:59.132
You can, uh, come to town
with me, vote for Lavon.

14:59.166 --> 15:00.467
No, I-I didn't because

15:00.500 --> 15:01.969
I can't vote in BlueBell.

15:02.002 --> 15:03.070
I don't live in town.

15:03.103 --> 15:05.138
Yeah, you do. I saw a map.

15:05.172 --> 15:07.474
I found out
from the utilities guy

15:07.507 --> 15:08.608
the town line
is right over there.

15:08.641 --> 15:10.077
I'm six feet outside it.

15:10.110 --> 15:13.146
(scoffs) Well, so, close enough,
right? Come on.

15:13.180 --> 15:14.281
Wade, I can't.

15:14.314 --> 15:15.415
You being serious right now?

15:15.448 --> 15:17.117
Well, it's dishonest.

15:17.150 --> 15:19.386
Oh, for God's sake, Tansy.
It's six feet.

15:19.419 --> 15:21.021
Come on!
Don't you start
yelling at me.

15:21.054 --> 15:23.223
I do not have to jump every time

15:23.256 --> 15:24.624
you say "frog" anymore,
Wade Kinsella.

15:24.657 --> 15:25.525
And why you got
to make such a big deal

15:25.558 --> 15:27.494
about all this stuff?
Just get in the car.

15:27.527 --> 15:29.462
Why do you not respect
what I want?

15:29.496 --> 15:31.031
This is why I'm taking
those self-empowerment DVDs

15:31.064 --> 15:32.165
I get out of the library.

15:32.199 --> 15:33.633
Oh, you must've
fast-forwarded

15:33.666 --> 15:34.534
through the part
where it told you

15:34.567 --> 15:36.203
how not to end up
living in a trailer.

15:36.236 --> 15:38.938
Mobile home, which
I thank you to leave now.

15:40.007 --> 15:40.974
Hey, Tansy.

15:41.008 --> 15:43.710
Hey.
Go away.

15:43.743 --> 15:45.245
Well, how much further
you want me to go?

15:45.278 --> 15:46.313
I'm already
standing clear over

15:46.346 --> 15:48.081
in the next town!

15:53.720 --> 15:55.755
MAN:
Good luck today, Mayor.

15:55.788 --> 15:57.557
WOMAN:
You coming
to vote, Mayor?

16:02.295 --> 16:03.296
Um.

16:03.330 --> 16:05.665
L-Lavon, hey, ooh, hi.

16:05.698 --> 16:07.300
Um...

16:09.602 --> 16:11.238
What was that last night?

16:11.271 --> 16:15.108
Hmm, uh, last night?

16:15.142 --> 16:16.276
Yeah, last night, the debate.

16:16.309 --> 16:18.611
Were... were you
flirting with me?

16:18.645 --> 16:20.413
Flirting?
Yeah.

16:20.447 --> 16:22.582
Whoa, ooh. What?

16:22.615 --> 16:24.217
(laughing nervously)

16:24.251 --> 16:25.385
Are you saying
that you weren't?

16:25.418 --> 16:27.087
Nope.

16:27.120 --> 16:28.721
Nah-uh.

16:28.755 --> 16:30.357
Why? Were you?
Was I?

16:30.390 --> 16:31.358
Flirting with you?

16:31.391 --> 16:32.492
(scoffs)

16:32.525 --> 16:33.760
Of course I was.

16:33.793 --> 16:35.628
Yeah, I'm just a
giggly schoolgirl

16:35.662 --> 16:37.530
with a big old crush
on famous Lavon Hayes.

16:37.564 --> 16:39.266
Uh... (nervous laugh)

16:39.299 --> 16:40.800
Uh, uh, no, no.

16:40.833 --> 16:42.702
Yeah, I-I mean, 'cause

16:42.735 --> 16:45.638
what, we been talking,
and, uh, I was,

16:45.672 --> 16:48.441
I was wondering
about your plans.
My plans?

16:48.475 --> 16:50.410
After the election, you know,
you seem like you've been

16:50.443 --> 16:52.445
warming up to certain things
in BlueBell.

16:54.081 --> 16:55.248
People.

16:55.282 --> 16:56.783
Well, after the election,

16:56.816 --> 16:59.252
I plan to be mayor,
so I plan to be busy.

16:59.286 --> 17:00.453
No, no, I-I

17:00.487 --> 17:03.823
I'm just, uh... saying.

17:03.856 --> 17:05.657
If I lose?
Mmm.

17:05.692 --> 17:07.426
Is what you saying, right?

17:07.460 --> 17:10.530
With no other reason
to stick around town, right?

17:12.165 --> 17:13.532
Well, don't you worry, Mayor.

17:13.566 --> 17:16.069
I'll be on the first bus
out of town.

17:28.181 --> 17:30.283
Will you stop playing
with your phone, please?

17:30.317 --> 17:31.818
(sighs)
Thank you.

17:31.851 --> 17:33.320
Now, um, how are

17:33.353 --> 17:34.687
your sleeping habits?

17:34.721 --> 17:35.788
Horizontal.

17:35.822 --> 17:36.756
Funny.

17:36.789 --> 17:39.259
Diet?
Normal.

17:39.292 --> 17:41.161
Mm-hmm, I don't think
you're taking me seriously.

17:41.194 --> 17:42.462
Also normal.

17:43.730 --> 17:45.565
Well, I know that things

17:45.598 --> 17:47.367
must be strange
around the house now.

17:47.400 --> 17:49.536
Lemon moving out.

17:49.569 --> 17:51.771
You raising Magnolia
all by yourself.

17:51.804 --> 17:55.308
Okay, stop.
Dr. Hart, thank you. I'm fine.

17:55.342 --> 17:57.177
I mean, if I-I've
been a little

17:57.210 --> 17:58.578
crabby lately, I apologize.

17:58.611 --> 18:00.447
Maybe it's Magnolia driving, uh.

18:00.480 --> 18:02.315
After you give your first

18:02.349 --> 18:03.683
driving lesson to a 15-year old,

18:03.716 --> 18:04.817
see if it doesn't
make you crazy.

18:04.851 --> 18:06.119
Fair enough.

18:06.153 --> 18:07.787
Yeah.

18:07.820 --> 18:09.122
And how are things
with Emily?

18:09.156 --> 18:10.857
They're great.

18:10.890 --> 18:12.392
Um, it's just fine.
Thanks.

18:17.564 --> 18:19.699
You know, maybe
that's my, uh, thyroid.

18:19.732 --> 18:20.633
You should check it.

18:24.837 --> 18:28.375
Okay, what is it?
What do you need my help with?

18:28.408 --> 18:31.144
Well, (clears throat) this
trailer, uh, belongs to Tansy.

18:31.178 --> 18:32.412
You remember Tansy, right?

18:32.445 --> 18:35.282
Yes, I do, and if you brought me
out here to mediate some dispute

18:35.315 --> 18:36.816
between you and your ex-wife,
well, last time I did that,

18:36.849 --> 18:38.218
I got shot in the leg
with an arrow, so...

18:38.251 --> 18:39.252
Well, you kind of

18:39.286 --> 18:41.288
shot yourself in the leg
with an arrow, but, uh.

18:41.321 --> 18:43.590
The safety was off, Wade.
Ah, look, doesn't matter.

18:43.623 --> 18:46.259
Anyway, I didn't bring you here
to mediate a dispute, all right?

18:46.293 --> 18:47.660
Brought you here to link up
your truck to the trailer hitch.

18:47.694 --> 18:48.861
You're going to drag it
about six feet that way

18:48.895 --> 18:50.263
cross the BlueBell town line.

18:50.297 --> 18:52.732
(laughing):
I'm sorry. What?

18:52.765 --> 18:54.901
So, Tansy can vote
in the election today. Come on.

18:54.934 --> 18:56.703
And you and Tansy
discussed this?

18:56.736 --> 18:58.805
Yeah, of course we did.
Come on.

18:58.838 --> 19:00.473
But, you know, Tansy,

19:00.507 --> 19:03.243
she's-she's got, you know,
"integrity" or whatever,

19:03.276 --> 19:05.578
so, uh, she won't vote
unless she lives in BlueBell.

19:05.612 --> 19:07.547
So, we got to bring her trailer
over into BlueBell.

19:09.616 --> 19:11.451
George Tucker, if you touch
my house, I will have you

19:11.484 --> 19:12.419
put in jail.

19:14.287 --> 19:15.555
(clears throat)

19:15.588 --> 19:18.658
Well, see, I said
I discussed it with her.

19:18.691 --> 19:20.427
Didn't say it went well, but,

19:20.460 --> 19:22.262
you know.

19:22.295 --> 19:24.464
You promised I'd what?

19:26.299 --> 19:27.800
Well, I got desperate, okay?

19:27.834 --> 19:29.536
I was trying to get all these

19:29.569 --> 19:31.471
undecided voters
over to your side

19:31.504 --> 19:33.540
and they kept talking about what
Ruby Jeffries would do for them,

19:33.573 --> 19:35.542
as if she will,
and one guy said,

19:35.575 --> 19:37.844
"Hey, what will
Lavon Hayes do for me?"

19:37.877 --> 19:40.447
Uh-huh, and-and you said?

19:40.480 --> 19:42.549
Cut your yard.

19:42.582 --> 19:45.285
I mean, it just sort of
came out so.

19:45.318 --> 19:46.286
I'm not cutting people's yards!

19:46.319 --> 19:47.620
It's just a few, okay?!

19:47.654 --> 19:48.955
And paint one fence.

19:48.988 --> 19:50.690
Oh, and one lady
said that

19:50.723 --> 19:51.958
she needs her birdhouse fixed

19:51.991 --> 19:53.793
because squirrels can get in
the way it is now.

19:53.826 --> 19:56.663
I don't care!
It's undignified.

19:56.696 --> 19:58.431
It's votes.

19:58.465 --> 19:59.866
It's buying votes,

19:59.899 --> 20:01.601
and Lavon Hayes
does not buy votes.

20:01.634 --> 20:03.803
Oh, really? Well, then you have
to do something, okay?

20:03.836 --> 20:05.538
Because I'm out there
killing myself

20:05.572 --> 20:07.840
trying to get you
every single vote by 5:00 p.m.,

20:07.874 --> 20:09.342
and you act like you don't
even want Ruby Jeffries

20:09.376 --> 20:10.610
out of our lives!

20:10.643 --> 20:12.312
Oh, oh, oh! See?

20:12.345 --> 20:13.580
That seems like
the most important part

20:13.613 --> 20:15.415
of the whole thing to you!

20:15.448 --> 20:17.584
Now why do you care so much

20:17.617 --> 20:19.986
about getting rid
of Ruby Jeffries?!

20:20.019 --> 20:22.822
You know what? I don't.

20:22.855 --> 20:25.725
Okay? Because if you don't care,
why should I?

20:25.758 --> 20:27.427
I quit. You know what?
What?!

20:27.460 --> 20:28.728
Let her be mayor.

20:28.761 --> 20:30.263
Let her be queen,
for all I care, you know?

20:30.297 --> 20:31.698
Why don't you name
the whole damn town after her

20:31.731 --> 20:32.899
if that's what you want?!

20:32.932 --> 20:36.336
You can put out a little sign
right at the edge of town,

20:36.369 --> 20:38.237
that says, "Now entering
RubyJeffriesBell.
Population: you!"

20:40.873 --> 20:42.309
Uh!

20:44.977 --> 20:46.613
ZOE:
Put your foot
on the gas pedal.

20:46.646 --> 20:47.680
Okay, just switch off...

20:47.714 --> 20:49.982
Oh, my God, I did it!
I made a right-hand turn!

20:50.016 --> 20:52.619
I can drive! I have
to text everyone
and tell them.

20:52.652 --> 20:53.853
No, no, no, no!

20:53.886 --> 20:55.722
No texting.

20:55.755 --> 20:57.390
But that's like
it never happened.

20:57.424 --> 20:59.859
Absolutely no texting
while driving ever.

20:59.892 --> 21:01.794
Dr. Hart, no!
I need it back.

21:01.828 --> 21:03.530
Please? I'm serious.
I won't text.

21:03.563 --> 21:05.798
Why do you need
your phone so badly?

21:05.832 --> 21:08.000
Never mind. Someone
was supposed to text me.

21:08.034 --> 21:08.901
Whatever.

21:08.935 --> 21:11.771
Oh... a boy?

21:11.804 --> 21:14.707
No, it's just some guy-- Lucas.

21:14.741 --> 21:16.343
He said he would text me

21:16.376 --> 21:17.644
about studying together,
and he hasn't.

21:17.677 --> 21:19.912
I hate him.

21:19.946 --> 21:22.549
I'm sorry. You know,
between you and your dad,

21:22.582 --> 21:24.717
I have been competing
with cell phones all day.

21:24.751 --> 21:27.420
I know. He's even
worse than me.

21:27.454 --> 21:29.556
Yeah, it's weird, right?
Yeah.

21:29.589 --> 21:31.458
Is everything okay
with him and Emily?

21:31.491 --> 21:33.059
(chuckling):
Yeah, like I keep up.

21:33.092 --> 21:35.728
Hey, can you teach me
how to power-slide now?

21:35.762 --> 21:37.730
No.

21:37.764 --> 21:40.700
It's six feet, Tucker.
It is six feet!

21:40.733 --> 21:42.435
It's kidnapping, Wade!
Kidnapping!
I didn't call

21:42.469 --> 21:43.903
George Tucker the lawyer,
all right?

21:43.936 --> 21:45.838
I called George Tucker,
the guy with a trailer hitch.

21:45.872 --> 21:48.575
And what if Tansy's vote
could make the difference

21:48.608 --> 21:50.710
in Lavon winning,
and we didn't even try, huh?

21:50.743 --> 21:53.980
Huh?!

21:54.013 --> 21:56.783
Over there.

21:56.816 --> 21:59.318
Go over there,
and you stay put.

22:03.790 --> 22:05.024
Tansy?

22:05.057 --> 22:07.460
What?

22:07.494 --> 22:09.762
(chuckles)
Hey, Tansy.

22:09.796 --> 22:11.564
Listen, I understand
that you got yourself

22:11.598 --> 22:13.833
all settled here,
and you picked

22:13.866 --> 22:16.836
a real great spot
for yourself, but I just

22:16.869 --> 22:18.838
wanted to know
if you would consider moving

22:18.871 --> 22:20.740
the six feet back to BlueBell
just for the day?

22:20.773 --> 22:23.576
I'm sorry.
I cannot go back to BlueBell.

22:23.610 --> 22:25.111
Too many memories.

22:25.144 --> 22:29.482
What? 'Cause of Wade?
Oh, come on.

22:29.516 --> 22:31.451
Tansy, heck, if everybody
who got mad at Wade

22:31.484 --> 22:33.453
moved out of BlueBell,
the place would be a ghost town.

22:33.486 --> 22:34.454
(chuckles)

22:34.487 --> 22:36.656
Here's how stupid I am:

22:36.689 --> 22:38.491
I actually thought
when he showed up today

22:38.525 --> 22:40.026
it was to see how I was doing.

22:40.059 --> 22:42.729
He knows I got
my cosmetology license,

22:42.762 --> 22:44.664
and never even asked me
to cut his hair.

22:46.466 --> 22:48.134
Well, you could cut my hair.

22:48.167 --> 22:49.235
What?

22:49.268 --> 22:53.005
Yeah. You know, I'm pretty
well-known in BlueBell,

22:53.039 --> 22:55.174
and I'm thinking if
I go walking around

22:55.207 --> 22:56.609
with a brand-new haircut,

22:56.643 --> 22:58.010
people might ask me
where I got it.

22:58.044 --> 23:00.780
I'd be like a walking
advertisement for your business.

23:00.813 --> 23:02.982
Yes, you would.

23:03.015 --> 23:07.186
If... you come with us today
and vote for Lavon.

23:07.219 --> 23:10.523
Deal. Get in here.

23:10.557 --> 23:11.691
All right.

23:12.992 --> 23:14.494
Oh, George the hero?

23:14.527 --> 23:17.497
Oh, no, Wade,
stop it! Stop it!

23:17.530 --> 23:18.731
You're embarrassing me.
You really are.

23:18.765 --> 23:19.799
Hey.

23:28.074 --> 23:29.108
There you are.

23:29.141 --> 23:31.778
Lavon said you quit?

23:31.811 --> 23:33.112
It's true.

23:33.145 --> 23:36.516
Well, I'm not happy
about that at all.

23:36.549 --> 23:37.717
That's you quitting on me.

23:37.750 --> 23:39.486
I don't see how.

23:39.519 --> 23:41.120
Because if you get Ruby

23:41.153 --> 23:45.024
out of the picture and out of
town, I have a shot with Lavon.

23:45.057 --> 23:47.994
I'm sorry.
I just can't do that.

23:48.027 --> 23:50.763
Why not? Ruby doesn't get
to swoop in and take him.

23:50.797 --> 23:52.031
I saw him first.

23:52.064 --> 23:54.734
No, you didn't.

23:54.767 --> 23:56.202
Well, okay, high school
doesn't count,

23:56.235 --> 23:58.070
but you know...

23:58.104 --> 24:02.942
No. I mean, I did.

24:02.975 --> 24:04.143
I'm sorry?

24:04.176 --> 24:08.615
Wait. You mean you and...?

24:10.650 --> 24:12.785
Lemon...

24:12.819 --> 24:17.524
We were in love once.

24:17.557 --> 24:19.926
And Lord help me,
I still think I am.

24:27.967 --> 24:31.170
Does Lavon still feel
the same way?

24:31.203 --> 24:34.741
No. No, I don't think so.

24:34.774 --> 24:37.176
Does he know how you feel?

24:37.209 --> 24:40.046
No. I mean, the last time
that we discussed it,

24:40.079 --> 24:43.816
I insisted quite firmly
that I did not.

24:43.850 --> 24:45.818
I mean, I was getting
ready to marry George.

24:45.852 --> 24:50.222
And then working so closely
with Lavon during the campaign,

24:50.256 --> 24:53.025
I felt myself...

24:53.059 --> 24:57.196
I just, I allowed myself...

24:57.229 --> 25:00.266
Oh, my. And there I was
throwing myself

25:00.299 --> 25:03.269
at the mayor like he was on fire
and I needed to put him out.

25:03.302 --> 25:06.205
(chuckles)
I'm so sorry.

25:06.238 --> 25:07.774
It's okay. You didn't know.

25:07.807 --> 25:10.910
Me always going on
about his body...

25:10.943 --> 25:13.045
and how he'd look
under those clothes.

25:13.079 --> 25:14.614
Good Lord.

25:14.647 --> 25:18.050
While all this time,
you already knew.

25:18.084 --> 25:19.686
AnnaBeth.
Hmm?

25:19.719 --> 25:23.623
I'm not telling you.
I know.

25:23.656 --> 25:26.626
Wade Kinsella. He's like a dog
I shouldn't have fed.

25:26.659 --> 25:28.628
No matter what I do
to rid myself of him,

25:28.661 --> 25:30.296
he always ends up
in my yard.

25:30.329 --> 25:31.898
Well, maybe it's fate then.

25:31.931 --> 25:33.265
(laughs)
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

25:33.299 --> 25:35.334
No laughing with scissors
back there near my head.

25:35.367 --> 25:36.936
Beats a crossbow.

25:36.969 --> 25:38.304
The safety was off.

25:38.337 --> 25:40.907
Don't twist around.
I can't see.
Sorry.

25:40.940 --> 25:44.176
Fate. That's another word
for blind and deaf.

25:44.210 --> 25:46.145
Yeah, sticking something out

25:46.178 --> 25:48.615
everyone and their mother could
see didn't work from the get-go.

25:48.648 --> 25:50.216
Come on.
Even from the start?

25:50.249 --> 25:51.350
Yep. Fought
from day one.

25:51.383 --> 25:54.353
For real? Why keep at it?

25:54.386 --> 25:56.155
Thought it was
"passion."

25:56.188 --> 25:57.790
Turned out we just
didn't get along.

25:57.824 --> 25:59.926
Every clue that you're
not meant for each other

25:59.959 --> 26:00.793
is there from the beginning,

26:00.827 --> 26:02.729
but you want so bad
for it to work,

26:02.762 --> 26:05.331
that you ignore
all the signs.

26:05.364 --> 26:08.601
Of course, taking 15 years
to notice is just nuts.

26:08.635 --> 26:10.336
Hey, now, Lemon and I
were very...

26:12.839 --> 26:13.906
What in the hell?!

26:18.811 --> 26:20.813
Wade! Wade, stop the truck!

26:20.847 --> 26:23.182
Wade, stop
the truck!

26:25.652 --> 26:27.787
Oh... Oh, no!

26:27.820 --> 26:30.757
Oh, my! It's okay.
It's fine.

26:30.790 --> 26:31.791
I can't even see it.

26:31.824 --> 26:34.360
(screaming):
Wade...!

26:39.966 --> 26:41.901
You keep checking
your phone.

26:41.934 --> 26:43.670
So?

26:44.904 --> 26:46.973
You're waiting
for Emily to call.

26:47.006 --> 26:48.274
That is none
of your concern.

26:48.307 --> 26:50.843
Did you have a fight?

26:50.877 --> 26:52.244
No.

26:52.278 --> 26:55.648
Did she break up
with you?

26:55.682 --> 26:58.084
No, she did not
break up with me.

26:58.117 --> 27:01.220
She did not have the decency
to break up with me.

27:02.922 --> 27:04.924
She hasn't returned my calls
for three days.

27:04.957 --> 27:06.292
She'll send an occasional
text message

27:06.325 --> 27:08.194
saying, "Oh, sorry.
Call u soon."

27:08.227 --> 27:09.295
With a little "u."

27:09.328 --> 27:11.630
And she doesn't call.

27:13.933 --> 27:15.902
When she first went back
to Charlotte,

27:15.935 --> 27:18.237
we talked all the time.

27:18.270 --> 27:21.874
Yeah, I know what's going on.

27:21.908 --> 27:24.010
You don't know.

27:24.043 --> 27:26.412
Yeah, right. I'm not stupid.
She's seeing someone else.

27:26.445 --> 27:29.048
Or she was seeing someone
before she came down here,

27:29.081 --> 27:32.451
and I was a vacation
or a mild diversion.

27:32.484 --> 27:33.920
Stop.

27:33.953 --> 27:35.688
You don't know.

27:35.722 --> 27:37.189
And you have to stop
torturing yourself.

27:37.223 --> 27:38.891
You mean torturing you.

27:38.925 --> 27:40.159
Yes, that, too.

27:40.192 --> 27:42.094
Look, if she won't
call you,

27:42.128 --> 27:44.697
you need to go
to North Carolina,

27:44.731 --> 27:47.166
face her, and get the truth.

27:47.199 --> 27:49.368
I'm not going up there.

27:49.401 --> 27:53.372
I mean, I'd probably walk in
on her and her secret family.

27:53.405 --> 27:55.374
Brick, you really like Emily.

27:55.407 --> 27:57.810
That doesn't come along
many times in life.

27:57.844 --> 28:00.913
I mean, yours, what, twice?

28:00.947 --> 28:02.915
I just think that
a man of your...

28:02.949 --> 28:04.817
height.

28:04.851 --> 28:07.253
You know, you can't
wait around forever.

28:07.286 --> 28:08.955
You deserve to know the score.
I don't know what it takes

28:08.988 --> 28:10.790
to get to Charlotte
from here, but...

28:10.823 --> 28:13.893
There's a flight out of Mobile
at 6:00. One hour, 41.

28:13.926 --> 28:15.361
Go. (chuckles)

28:17.063 --> 28:19.331
You know, If I stop by
the house, pick up some clothes,

28:19.365 --> 28:20.933
I could just make it.
Oh, Lordy!

28:20.967 --> 28:21.934
What?

28:21.968 --> 28:23.202
I forgot to vote!

28:26.272 --> 28:28.775
One minute, 15 seconds.

28:28.808 --> 28:30.242
Daddy...
Can't talk right now.

28:30.276 --> 28:32.178
Look, you stay at your sister's
place tonight.

28:32.211 --> 28:34.380
I have to vote by 5:00
and then take a quick trip.

28:34.413 --> 28:36.082
But it's almost
exactly 5:00 now.

28:36.115 --> 28:37.950
She's right.

28:37.984 --> 28:40.352
Wait! Lemon gave me absentee
and proxy ballots!

28:40.386 --> 28:41.353
Oh!

28:42.855 --> 28:44.356
DASH:
One minute.

28:47.259 --> 28:48.761
Doesn't write.

28:48.795 --> 28:50.162
Oh, for the love...!

28:50.196 --> 28:51.497
DASH:
20 seconds.

28:53.966 --> 28:55.367
Well, anybody left?

28:59.138 --> 29:01.207
Six, five...

29:01.240 --> 29:03.409
Harley, ring the bell.

29:06.979 --> 29:08.514
(bell ringing)

29:08.547 --> 29:10.382
Made it! I saw it.
It's legal. Now go.

29:10.416 --> 29:12.819
I'll go turn this in
at the polling place.

29:12.852 --> 29:14.453
Dr. Hart, no!

29:14.486 --> 29:17.990
I have been promised
a driving lesson.

29:18.024 --> 29:19.291
I signed it
before the deadline.

29:19.325 --> 29:22.228
It counts as much
if you hand it in now
or an hour from now.

29:22.261 --> 29:23.429
Okay.

29:24.496 --> 29:26.165
All right, let's drive.

29:26.198 --> 29:27.934
It is only one vote.

29:29.168 --> 29:30.937
It's a tie!

29:33.305 --> 29:35.808
A tie? So now what?

29:35.842 --> 29:37.509
Well, I dug up a copy

29:37.543 --> 29:40.913
of the BlueBell constitution
and by-laws,

29:40.947 --> 29:42.982
It says the first tiebreaker
is a recount,

29:43.015 --> 29:44.516
which we already did.

29:44.550 --> 29:46.385
So what's the
next tiebreaker?

29:46.418 --> 29:48.554
"A contest of athletic skill..."

29:48.587 --> 29:52.358
Athletic. Yeah, bring it on!

29:52.391 --> 29:54.026
"In which weapons are chosen

29:54.060 --> 29:57.964
between iron club
or a pointed stick."

29:57.997 --> 29:59.431
Next.

29:59.465 --> 30:03.035
Then, by legal mandate
of the town's constitution,

30:03.069 --> 30:07.473
the third and last
tiebreaker is...

30:07.506 --> 30:09.041
The chicken decides?

30:09.075 --> 30:12.011
And once it picks,
the result is final.

30:12.044 --> 30:14.180
Well, how does a law like that
get in the constitution?

30:14.213 --> 30:16.883
Oh, there's lots of old laws
like that on town books.

30:16.916 --> 30:18.017
In Auburn, Alabama,

30:18.050 --> 30:21.020
it is officially against
the law to deflower a virgin.

30:21.053 --> 30:22.288
So what?
In Auburn,

30:22.321 --> 30:24.523
you're unlikely
to encounter one.
Hey!

30:24.556 --> 30:25.992
I can't believe
this is happening!

30:26.025 --> 30:27.927
And that chicken
always picks Ruby!

30:27.960 --> 30:29.862
MAN:
Hey, Tom, what's going on?

30:29.896 --> 30:30.729
That's right.

30:30.762 --> 30:33.365
Meaning that Ruby
will stay in town,

30:33.399 --> 30:35.067
giving her and Lavon a chance

30:35.101 --> 30:38.070
without Lavon ever even knowing
how you feel about him.

30:38.104 --> 30:40.372
I don't know if Lavon
even cares how I feel.

30:40.406 --> 30:42.074
But you should
be in the race.

30:42.108 --> 30:44.143
Go tell him before
it's too late.

30:44.176 --> 30:46.478
Don't put your heart
in the hands of a chicken.

30:46.512 --> 30:50.016
You always give
such good advice.

30:50.049 --> 30:51.550
I wish I'd had
more to drink.

30:51.583 --> 30:54.453
No, no.
You've had plenty.

30:57.156 --> 31:01.127
(door opens)

31:01.160 --> 31:03.329
Hey, man, why aren't you in town
with everybody else

31:03.362 --> 31:04.931
waiting for the results
to come in?

31:04.964 --> 31:06.365
Watching a chicken pick
our mayor?

31:06.398 --> 31:08.100
Come on.

31:08.134 --> 31:09.501
We're gonna be the laughingstock

31:09.535 --> 31:11.270
of every town
in America.

31:11.303 --> 31:12.972
You could be the mayor
of that laughingstock.

31:13.005 --> 31:15.541
I won't be. The chicken
picks Ruby every time.

31:15.574 --> 31:19.145
Okay, but what if it doesn't?

31:19.178 --> 31:21.513
Then she leaves town.

31:24.016 --> 31:28.287
Whoo... I'm guessing that isn't
the greatest outcome either.

31:28.320 --> 31:30.289
So you can understand
my problem?

31:30.322 --> 31:32.291
Yeah.

31:32.324 --> 31:34.260
But does Ruby understand it?

31:36.963 --> 31:39.598
That is unclear.

31:39.631 --> 31:41.533
If that chicken picks you
tonight...

31:41.567 --> 31:42.568
she never will.

31:45.571 --> 31:46.939
You think that could happen?

31:46.973 --> 31:48.107
Well, Lavon,

31:48.140 --> 31:50.676
it is a chicken.

31:50.709 --> 31:53.345
Okay, I'm going.
All right.

31:53.379 --> 31:55.647
Get 'em.
Lavon, Lavon!

31:55.681 --> 31:57.416
No, I can't talk now.
There's something I got to do.
Wait. Lavon, please?!

31:59.285 --> 32:00.953
Is it just me

32:00.987 --> 32:04.056
or was last election day
an altogether quieter event?

32:14.500 --> 32:16.435
Make ready the arena!

32:16.468 --> 32:17.436
(crowd cheers)

32:17.469 --> 32:19.305
Tom, bring the chicken.

32:19.338 --> 32:21.607
Yes, sir!
(cheering)

32:24.043 --> 32:26.345
Hey-o.

32:26.378 --> 32:29.681
Guess what, genius?
The polls were closed already,

32:29.715 --> 32:32.618
so even if I wanted
to vote, I can't!

32:32.651 --> 32:35.054
Great day's work, Wade.
Really great.

32:35.087 --> 32:38.190
Not only did you
endanger our lives,

32:38.224 --> 32:40.526
you hijacked a house,
and because of you,

32:40.559 --> 32:43.095
Tansy gave me the worst haircut
in the history of the world!

32:47.666 --> 32:49.668
Yes, George,
thank you so much.

32:49.701 --> 32:53.439
You really are a
walking advertisement!

32:54.373 --> 32:56.508
Wait, Tansy, I...

32:56.542 --> 32:57.709
Well, nice work, buddy.

33:00.079 --> 33:01.213
Go.

33:02.581 --> 33:03.615
(cheering)

33:09.755 --> 33:11.157
(tires screech)

33:11.190 --> 33:13.492
ZOE:
Foot on the gas.

33:13.525 --> 33:15.294
(tires screech)
Whoa!

33:16.595 --> 33:19.398
(cheering continues)

33:19.431 --> 33:21.100
Ruby. Ruby, we
need to talk.

33:21.133 --> 33:22.101
Okay, okay, hold on.

33:22.134 --> 33:23.669
I just need to see
what this chicken's gonna do.

33:23.702 --> 33:25.104
No. Now.

33:25.137 --> 33:26.672
C-Come on.
(groans)

33:29.408 --> 33:31.643
There you are,
Captain America.

33:31.677 --> 33:33.112
Hey.

33:33.145 --> 33:34.780
I want to show you
my fancy sticker.

33:34.813 --> 33:36.148
Oh, well, look at that.
Somebody voted.

33:36.182 --> 33:37.416
And it's awesome
that you did,

33:37.449 --> 33:38.517
because if you
wouldn't have,

33:38.550 --> 33:40.386
Lavon would have
lost by one vote.

33:40.419 --> 33:41.687
So, every vote does count.

33:41.720 --> 33:43.589
I know. It really is cool.

33:43.622 --> 33:46.658
Except, uh, actually,
I voted for Ruby.

33:46.692 --> 33:48.394
No, no, no, no!

33:48.427 --> 33:50.096
Presley, you were supposed
to vote for Lavon!

33:50.129 --> 33:52.364
Okay, wait.
Are you mad at me?

33:52.398 --> 33:53.799
No. No.

33:53.832 --> 33:56.135
I just-- I had, I had laid out
the choices for you,

33:56.168 --> 33:59.571
and I thought that I made
 the choice really clear.

33:59.605 --> 34:03.109
Okay, so, it's super-important
for America and all that I vote,

34:03.142 --> 34:04.843
but only if I vote
how you want me to?

34:04.876 --> 34:06.678
No!

34:06.712 --> 34:08.647
I mean, in this case,
yes, but-but no.

34:08.679 --> 34:10.149
Wow.
No!

34:10.181 --> 34:11.117
I mean, no.

34:11.150 --> 34:13.152
Yes.
Wow.

34:13.185 --> 34:15.286
Because I'm getting a real
strong "run away" vibe right now

34:15.321 --> 34:16.655
that I think
I'm gonna listen to.

34:16.688 --> 34:18.424
So let's just call this
a bullet dodged, okay, Captain,

34:18.456 --> 34:20.226
and say bye-bye.

34:20.259 --> 34:22.694
Oh.

34:22.728 --> 34:24.795
And nice haircut.

34:24.830 --> 34:25.831
Presley...

34:25.864 --> 34:27.065
(sighs)

34:28.134 --> 34:30.101
Okay.

34:30.136 --> 34:32.170
Yeah, I was flirting
with you in the debate.

34:32.204 --> 34:33.438
But I didn't mean to.

34:33.472 --> 34:35.407
You just
bring it out in me.

34:35.440 --> 34:37.643
And I thought I'd felt something
coming back the other way,

34:37.676 --> 34:39.844
and if I got that wrong,
then I'm sorry.

34:39.878 --> 34:41.647
But, oh, you're probably
going to be mayor anyway,

34:41.679 --> 34:43.449
and I thought that would
make me feel bad,

34:43.482 --> 34:44.815
but if it means
you staying here,

34:44.850 --> 34:46.585
I really don't know
how it makes me feel.

34:46.618 --> 34:47.553
You see what you did?

34:52.757 --> 34:53.759
I was flirting with you, too.

34:56.262 --> 34:59.331
But then you said you weren't,
and I got scared and...

34:59.365 --> 35:01.900
Lavon, I've been hurt
by you already,

35:01.933 --> 35:05.204
and I don't want to go
through that again.

35:05.237 --> 35:08.507
And if I lose, I figured
I'd just skip town

35:08.540 --> 35:12.578
without getting any
further... involved.

35:16.348 --> 35:18.817
And what if you win?

35:18.850 --> 35:22.354
Well, then I got myself
a big problem then, don't I?

35:24.456 --> 35:25.691
CROWD (chanting):
Ruby! Ruby!

35:25.724 --> 35:26.892
CROWD (chanting):
Lavon! Lavon!

35:26.925 --> 35:28.760
(cheering and chanting continue)

35:32.264 --> 35:33.499
Hey, Dash.

35:33.532 --> 35:34.533
Hey.

35:34.566 --> 35:35.701
Lots of excitement, huh?

35:35.734 --> 35:36.602
Yes, it is.

35:36.635 --> 35:38.370
Uh, what do I do
with this absentee ballot?

35:38.404 --> 35:41.207
What?

35:41.240 --> 35:42.508
T-Tom, stop the chicken!

35:48.747 --> 35:49.881
Where is he?
Where's Lavon?

35:49.915 --> 35:50.716
I don't know.

35:50.749 --> 35:53.485
May I have your
attention, please!

35:55.454 --> 35:57.389
As Superintendent of Elections,

35:57.423 --> 35:59.625
I have examined
the ballot, and...

35:59.658 --> 36:02.394
and I have declared it valid.

36:02.428 --> 36:06.965
And by one vote, the election
goes to Mayor Lavon Hayes!

36:06.998 --> 36:08.700
(cheering)

36:10.836 --> 36:13.405
Now, okay, now, now, now...

36:13.439 --> 36:15.441
Can we locate Mayor Lavon Hayes?

36:15.474 --> 36:17.443
And also Ruby Jeffries?

36:18.344 --> 36:20.312
Can we do that?

36:21.713 --> 36:22.581
Oh, my.

36:25.851 --> 36:27.686
GEORGE:
Oh, I found him.

36:27.719 --> 36:30.856
(cheering)

36:53.912 --> 36:55.314
MAN:
 Everybody, to our
 new mayor, Lavon Hayes!

36:55.347 --> 36:56.582
(cheering)
Oh, thank you.

36:56.615 --> 36:57.683
(laughs)

36:57.716 --> 36:58.684
Thank you!

36:58.717 --> 36:59.985
(laughs)
Excuse me.

37:00.018 --> 37:02.488
Uh, excuse me.
Uh, excuse me.

37:02.521 --> 37:04.590
I'd like to propose
a toast.

37:04.623 --> 37:05.724
While campaigning,
I got to meet

37:05.757 --> 37:07.326
all of the good people
of this town.

37:07.359 --> 37:09.861
And while I originally planned
to be on the first bus

37:09.895 --> 37:13.699
if I lost,
I realized that there are

37:13.732 --> 37:16.835
other things
worth sticking around for.

37:18.570 --> 37:21.006
(cheering)

37:21.039 --> 37:23.008
To BlueBell!

37:26.044 --> 37:27.846
(computer beeping)

37:27.879 --> 37:29.448
BRICK:
Hey. Zoe, can you see...

37:29.481 --> 37:31.450
Can you see me? Zoe?

37:31.483 --> 37:32.984
Hey.

37:33.018 --> 37:34.420
Brick?

37:34.453 --> 37:35.554
Is that you?

37:35.587 --> 37:37.022
Hey, can you see me?
Whoa!

37:37.055 --> 37:39.891
Kind of, but you don't have
to lean in so close to talk.

37:39.925 --> 37:40.859
Oh.

37:40.892 --> 37:42.394
Where are you?

37:42.428 --> 37:42.994
I'm at Emily's house.

37:43.028 --> 37:45.531
Oh! Well, what happened?

37:45.564 --> 37:47.533
Well, it was just
a misunderstanding is all.

37:47.566 --> 37:49.067
I feel like such a dummy.

37:49.100 --> 37:51.002
She wasn't calling me back

37:51.036 --> 37:53.004
because she was working
double-time

37:53.038 --> 37:56.408
so she could take some time
off-- ain't that right?--

37:56.442 --> 37:59.311
and she was gonna pay me
a surprise visit.

37:59.345 --> 38:01.380
If I'd been another hour late,

38:01.413 --> 38:03.749
we would've
missed each other entirely.

38:03.782 --> 38:06.685
Oh, yay. That's great.

38:06.718 --> 38:08.387
So everything's good,

38:08.420 --> 38:10.622
and you are not
a pain in the ass anymore?

38:10.656 --> 38:12.924
Well, I wouldn't go that far,
but, yeah,

38:12.958 --> 38:15.327
things here are very good.

38:15.361 --> 38:16.795
And I also wanted to tell you...

38:16.828 --> 38:18.063
Oh, don't worry about it.

38:18.096 --> 38:19.765
You don't have to thank me.

38:19.798 --> 38:20.766
...to order supplies tomorrow.

38:20.799 --> 38:21.967
I do not want that place

38:22.000 --> 38:23.969
falling apart
just 'cause I'm here.

38:24.002 --> 38:25.537
Okay?

38:25.571 --> 38:26.772
Wait, what'd you say, Brick? No.

38:26.805 --> 38:28.106
Oh, bad connection.

38:28.139 --> 38:29.475
You're breaking up. Ah!

38:29.508 --> 38:31.710
Zoe...
Bad connection!

38:37.783 --> 38:39.451
Hey.

38:41.720 --> 38:42.788
Oh, I'm sorry.

38:42.821 --> 38:44.523
I just came to
collect my things.

38:44.556 --> 38:46.825
I thought that you'd be at
your party a little longer.

38:46.858 --> 38:48.927
Yeah, I looked for you there.

38:51.463 --> 38:54.433
What was it
you wanted to say before?

38:54.466 --> 38:56.868
You know what? I...

38:56.902 --> 38:58.604
I don't remember.

38:58.637 --> 39:00.506
Huh.
Hmm.

39:00.539 --> 39:02.574
I'm actually glad you came by.

39:02.608 --> 39:04.042
You are?
Yeah.

39:04.075 --> 39:06.478
I wanted to give you something.

39:09.147 --> 39:10.916
Just to say thank you.

39:10.949 --> 39:12.751
I couldn't have done this
without you.

39:12.784 --> 39:14.152
(chuckles)
To be able
to work together.

39:14.185 --> 39:16.054
I was a little worried.

39:16.087 --> 39:17.756
(both chuckle)

39:17.789 --> 39:20.358
But look how far we've come.
(laughs)

39:31.169 --> 39:33.505
It's a candle.

39:33.539 --> 39:35.474
I hope it's your taste,
you know.

39:35.507 --> 39:36.508
I never know
what you want, so...

39:38.777 --> 39:40.646
It's lovely.

39:42.047 --> 39:43.649
Thank you.

39:51.189 --> 39:53.391
It was a pleasure
serving you, Mr. Mayor.

39:55.661 --> 39:58.063
Congratulations
on your victory.

40:07.739 --> 40:09.908
So I was right
about Brick, huh?

40:09.941 --> 40:11.843
He just needed
to get laid.

40:11.877 --> 40:13.979
It's a bit more nuanced
than that.

40:14.012 --> 40:16.515
I doubt it.

40:16.548 --> 40:19.017
He just needed
to feel connected.

40:19.050 --> 40:20.986
Oh, it's a funny way
to feel connected,

40:21.019 --> 40:22.788
choosing someone
that lives 600 miles away.

40:22.821 --> 40:24.656
I mean, it's a pretty
lousy start.

40:24.690 --> 40:27.726
It's not about
the distance.

40:27.759 --> 40:32.598
You know, people can
conquer... miles,

40:32.631 --> 40:35.501
any sort of obstacle,
if it's meant to be.

40:35.534 --> 40:37.603
Look at what we all
went through today

40:37.636 --> 40:39.871
just to choose the next
two-year mayor of BlueBell.

40:39.905 --> 40:41.840
You think we're remotely
qualified to pick

40:41.873 --> 40:44.510
who we're supposed to be with
for the rest of our lives?

40:44.543 --> 40:46.678
Hmm. Good point.

40:46.712 --> 40:49.715
Hell, kind of decisions
I've been making recently,

40:49.748 --> 40:51.717
I'm probably better off
letting a chicken decide.

40:51.750 --> 40:53.519
What?!
(laughs)

40:53.552 --> 40:55.487
Ooh!
You are such a jerk!

40:56.822 --> 40:59.658
(sighs)

40:59.691 --> 41:01.627
All right.

41:01.660 --> 41:02.861
Looks like
you're all set.

41:02.894 --> 41:05.263
Thank you for getting me
set up again.

41:05.296 --> 41:07.533
Sorry about Wade.

41:07.566 --> 41:09.601
I should just hand out cards:
"Sorry about Wade."

41:09.635 --> 41:10.602
No.

41:10.636 --> 41:12.671
No, it's fine.

41:12.704 --> 41:15.807
But I wanted to thank you for
giving me that advice earlier.

41:15.841 --> 41:19.611
About finding clues to figure
out if you're right for somebody

41:19.645 --> 41:21.613
right from the
start, you know.

41:21.647 --> 41:23.114
Kept me from chasing down
another wrong street, so...

41:23.148 --> 41:25.050
Good God, if I'm giving
relationship advice,

41:25.083 --> 41:26.852
the world is definitely
off its axis.

41:26.885 --> 41:28.654
(laughs)

41:28.687 --> 41:31.189
But what I was hoping you also
might be good at is, uh...

41:33.659 --> 41:34.993
...helping me fix
this haircut, somehow.

41:35.026 --> 41:36.762
That I can do.

41:36.795 --> 41:38.530
(both chuckle)

41:38.564 --> 41:42.033
I mean, if...
you trust me to.

41:42.067 --> 41:44.536
I trust you just fine.

41:44.570 --> 41:46.672
Come on.

41:51.643 --> 41:55.180
