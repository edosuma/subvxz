00:27.959 --> 00:28.925
Wake up.

Wake...Up.

00:30.528 --> 00:32.162
[Whines]

00:33.530 --> 00:34.864
Yeah.

00:34.898 --> 00:36.199
[Snoring]

00:36.234 --> 00:38.302
Try this.

00:44.275 --> 00:46.776
[Grunts] Oh, fuck.

00:55.215 --> 00:56.348
Hey, dad.

00:56.382 --> 00:57.415
[Gasps]
Oh, shit. Hey.

00:57.450 --> 01:00.050
Grandpa's making French toast.

01:01.052 --> 01:02.919
What's mom doing here?

01:02.954 --> 01:04.989
Oh, your mother, she...
[Laughs]

01:05.022 --> 01:06.725
She had some work to do.

01:06.759 --> 01:07.859
Why is she asleep?

01:07.893 --> 01:09.661
It was hard work.

01:09.695 --> 01:11.730
Should I tell grandpa
to make her French toast?

01:11.764 --> 01:13.298
Oh, absolutely not.

01:13.332 --> 01:14.332
Okay.

01:32.848 --> 01:34.415
Monica, can you please
get out of here?

01:34.450 --> 01:35.916
Where is here?

01:35.951 --> 01:37.451
It's my place.

01:37.485 --> 01:39.519
How many pills did you
have last night anyway?

01:39.554 --> 01:40.753
[Grunting] Which flavor?

01:40.788 --> 01:43.055
Baby, this isn't
gonna happen again.

01:43.090 --> 01:44.690
What did happen last night?

01:44.725 --> 01:46.159
What did you think happened
last night?

01:46.193 --> 01:47.627
Oh, I smell French toast.

01:47.661 --> 01:48.827
Yeah, but you can't have any.

01:48.862 --> 01:50.262
You have to get out.

01:50.297 --> 01:51.497
Come on.

01:51.532 --> 01:53.299
After what you did to me
last night...

01:53.333 --> 01:54.600
Why not?

01:54.635 --> 01:56.336
Because you're a sociopath
and an addict,

01:56.370 --> 01:58.304
and I can't even look
at you right now.

01:58.339 --> 01:59.973
Right back at you, sweetie.

02:00.008 --> 02:01.908
- Yeah.
- [Laughs]

02:03.278 --> 02:05.479
Good-bye, boys!

02:05.513 --> 02:06.479
Bye, mom!

02:06.514 --> 02:07.981
Oh.

02:09.750 --> 02:11.784
Love you.

02:11.818 --> 02:13.385
Hey, dad, sit down and eat.

02:13.419 --> 02:15.453
Lost my appetite.
[Door closes]

02:15.488 --> 02:17.021
Bet you're hungry, though.

02:17.056 --> 02:19.523
Oh, yeah, I'm starved.

02:19.558 --> 02:21.125
Auditions are today.

02:21.159 --> 02:23.360
- For what again?
- <i>Grease.</i>

02:23.394 --> 02:24.461
Yeah.

02:24.495 --> 02:25.529
And what part are you
auditioning?

02:25.563 --> 02:27.197
Sandy.

02:27.232 --> 02:30.067
The part immortalized
by Olivia Newton-John.

02:30.102 --> 02:31.168
Huh.

02:32.404 --> 02:34.505
That's great, bud.

02:34.539 --> 02:36.374
Think you got a shot?

02:36.408 --> 02:38.109
Brittany Kauffman
knows all the songs,

02:38.143 --> 02:39.978
but she looks like a pug.

02:40.012 --> 02:41.680
Well, great, go for it.

02:41.714 --> 02:43.515
I bet you're gonna kick
that little pug's ass.

02:43.549 --> 02:45.717
- Dad...
- Damn right.

02:45.752 --> 02:47.519
I gotta poo.

02:50.155 --> 02:51.823
- So I just--
- Yeah.

02:51.857 --> 02:53.757
Just like it was
any part in any play.

02:53.792 --> 02:55.259
Yeah, 'cause dressing up
like a slut

02:55.293 --> 02:57.027
and trying to get John Travolta
to fuck you,

02:57.061 --> 02:58.828
that's just like trying out for
the little league, right, dad?

02:58.863 --> 03:00.397
Oh, you wanna fuck him up
about it,

03:00.431 --> 03:02.632
just lean on in,
call him a Nancy boy.

03:02.666 --> 03:04.200
He's looking for me
to push back.

03:04.234 --> 03:06.135
He's looking for a little
positive attention.

03:06.169 --> 03:07.871
All right, super shrink.

03:07.905 --> 03:09.505
Retired.

03:09.540 --> 03:10.807
Yes, exactly.

03:10.841 --> 03:12.509
So why don't you go play dominos
or something

03:12.543 --> 03:14.044
and stop trying to tell me
how to raise my kid.

03:14.078 --> 03:15.411
Maybe I wouldn't
have to be here

03:15.446 --> 03:17.847
if he had one fit parent
between the two of you.

03:17.881 --> 03:20.249
[Chokes and laughs] Really?

03:20.283 --> 03:22.518
I mean 'cause you were
an awesome parent.

03:22.552 --> 03:24.554
All right, look,
I guess your mother and I

03:24.588 --> 03:27.923
- could have done a better job.
- Dad.

03:29.926 --> 03:32.361
- I gotta go to work.
- Ha.

03:32.395 --> 03:33.929
I actually have a real job.

03:33.963 --> 03:37.700
Since when is management
consulting a real job?

03:37.734 --> 03:42.038
Since it pays
seven figures a year.

03:42.072 --> 03:43.439
Hey, dad,

03:43.474 --> 03:45.208
are you gonna see a Broadway
show in New York?

03:45.242 --> 03:47.710
I don't think so, buddy.
I got a lot of work to do.

03:47.744 --> 03:50.779
Well, when you get back,
can we go shoe shopping?

03:50.814 --> 03:53.982
Yes, shoe shopping
this weekend.

03:54.016 --> 03:55.784
Thanks, dad.

03:55.818 --> 03:57.886
- Love you.
- Love you too.

03:57.920 --> 04:00.421
If we don't stick the landing
on this one,

04:00.456 --> 04:02.424
our pod could be eliminated.

04:02.458 --> 04:03.625
Hey, no pressure.

04:03.659 --> 04:04.860
So what are they looking for?

04:04.894 --> 04:06.629
They're looking for
a market position.

04:06.663 --> 04:08.063
Like they don't already
have one.

04:08.098 --> 04:09.598
They're masters
of the fucking universe.

04:09.632 --> 04:11.133
You know, it's like my econ
Professor at Harvard

04:11.168 --> 04:12.401
- used to say to me...
- Oh, my God.

04:12.435 --> 04:13.568
"Never examine the motives
of the guys

04:13.603 --> 04:14.903
writing your checks."

04:14.938 --> 04:17.172
Unless you say something
that supports the position

04:17.206 --> 04:19.007
they're secretly hoping
we advance.

04:19.041 --> 04:20.476
Yeah, but what's the objective?

04:20.510 --> 04:21.976
They want us to tell them
that they're prefect.

04:22.011 --> 04:23.779
Look, fuck what they want,
okay?

04:23.813 --> 04:26.147
Consulting's like dissing
a really pretty girl

04:26.182 --> 04:28.283
so that she'll want you more.

04:28.317 --> 04:30.084
We need them to think
they're almost perfect,

04:30.119 --> 04:32.587
so we can book that afterwork.

04:32.621 --> 04:34.622
Afterwork.

04:34.656 --> 04:36.890
Afterwork, really, is the goal
of all consulting.

04:36.925 --> 04:38.625
Get them on the tit,

04:38.660 --> 04:41.261
thinking that their business
is gonna fail without you.

04:41.296 --> 04:43.297
They hire you week in
and week out.

04:43.331 --> 04:46.167
That's millions and millions
in billable hours.

04:46.201 --> 04:47.668
That's what we want, baby.

04:47.703 --> 04:49.604
[Crunching]
[Speaking indistinctly]

04:49.638 --> 04:50.705
Please.
God.

04:50.740 --> 04:52.140
Doug, chew.

04:52.174 --> 04:53.675
What?
God, sorry.

04:53.709 --> 04:55.077
Don't take another bite.

04:55.111 --> 04:56.812
I can't help it.
It's really good.

04:56.846 --> 04:58.680
Here's the thing.

04:58.715 --> 05:01.650
These guys are just looking for
a way to justify their bonuses.

05:01.685 --> 05:03.352
Yeah.
And why shouldn't they?

05:03.386 --> 05:05.020
Because they robbed
the American public

05:05.054 --> 05:07.456
of billions of dollars
by selling them bad mortgages?

05:07.490 --> 05:09.258
- Oh, boo-hoo.

05:09.292 --> 05:10.626
So who are the players?

05:10.660 --> 05:13.562
The CEO of Metrocapital
is K. Warren McDale.

05:13.596 --> 05:17.532
But his little yapping spaniel
is Greg Norbert.

05:17.567 --> 05:19.701
It's gonna be about scoring
with Norbert.

05:19.736 --> 05:21.069
But he knows that.
We can't suck up to this guy.

05:21.104 --> 05:22.504
We got a alpha-dog his ass.

05:22.538 --> 05:24.873
Marty, we cannot get counseled
out on this job.

05:26.676 --> 05:28.010
Counseled out.

05:28.044 --> 05:29.879
That's consultant for fired.

05:29.913 --> 05:31.882
It's not good.

05:41.961 --> 05:43.729
Look, she's basically
giving it to you.

05:43.763 --> 05:45.297
She wasn't.
That's not true.

05:45.331 --> 05:47.532
Come on, I'm gonna figure
it out one of these days,

05:47.567 --> 05:48.867
your dirty little secret.

05:48.902 --> 05:49.901
- You are?
- Yeah.

05:49.936 --> 05:51.236
- My secret?
- That's right.

05:51.270 --> 05:52.604
Whatever it is.
Okay.

05:52.638 --> 05:54.239
- I mean, I know about the baby
thing, but--

05:54.273 --> 05:55.707
- What baby thing?
- The baby thing.

05:55.741 --> 05:57.175
You want to have a baby.
Someday.

05:57.210 --> 05:59.377
- I mean, after I make partner.
- Yeah. But when we got drunk

05:59.411 --> 06:00.879
in Pittsburgh that time,
you said...

06:00.913 --> 06:02.347
- What?
- What did you say?

06:02.381 --> 06:03.715
You wanted to...
Fuck, what was it?

06:03.749 --> 06:05.484
- Oh, my God.
- It was terrifying.

06:05.518 --> 06:06.718
Oh, harvest!
No.

06:06.753 --> 06:08.187
You wanted to harvest
your eggs.

06:08.221 --> 06:09.722
You know what?
You have no soul.

06:09.757 --> 06:11.691
Because you didn't wanna
depend on a man.

06:11.725 --> 06:14.027
I never said that.
But it's true.

06:14.062 --> 06:15.662
That's some control freak
shit, Jeannie.

06:15.697 --> 06:16.930
You got to look at that.

Galweather--

07:44.723 --> 07:46.124
- I'll just
sneak in here real quick.

07:46.159 --> 07:49.094
I'll take care of it from here.
And this is my mobile.

want and we'll see what happens.

in a strategy session.

- Did you say Greg Norbert?
- [Chuckles] Yeah, I did.

- [Laughs]
- Yeah.

09:08.245 --> 09:11.748
Metrocapital, as is,
is a work of art.

09:11.782 --> 09:13.483
It's a Giotto, a Rembrandt.

09:13.517 --> 09:16.820
So how do you make improvements
on a masterpiece?

09:24.462 --> 09:25.895
So the germane question

09:25.930 --> 09:29.599
is where do you feel you're
headed as a company organically?

09:39.977 --> 09:42.279
Because, look,
the pod remains convinced

09:42.313 --> 09:43.780
there's a burning platform,

09:43.814 --> 09:45.048
but we just don't
have a bandwidth

09:45.082 --> 09:46.382
to go into a black factory

09:46.417 --> 09:48.118
and blow up the paradigms
with a white paper.

09:48.152 --> 09:50.086
[Laughs] We don't have it.

09:50.121 --> 09:52.522
You think I haven't
hired and fired

09:52.556 --> 09:54.724
a thousand management
consultants?

09:54.758 --> 09:57.593
I know all of your
bullshit tricks.

09:57.628 --> 09:59.795
You get me a dog that hunts...

09:59.830 --> 10:02.431
Or I'll put a bullet
in its head.

10:02.465 --> 10:04.065
[Chuckles]

10:04.100 --> 10:06.568
All right, Greg, what's next?

10:06.602 --> 10:07.936
Well, let's look at
the numbers.

10:07.970 --> 10:09.771
We're fucked.

10:09.805 --> 10:11.239
I mean, we're gonna get
counseled out.

10:11.273 --> 10:12.273
I can feel it.

10:12.308 --> 10:13.475
Oh, my God, Doug.
Shut up.

10:13.509 --> 10:16.011
You gotta shut the fuck up.

10:16.046 --> 10:17.913
Why don't we just pitch
massive layoffs, right?

10:17.948 --> 10:19.215
It usually
freaks everybody out,

10:19.249 --> 10:20.516
gets the attention off of us.

10:20.551 --> 10:21.785
They don't need
massive layoffs.

10:21.819 --> 10:23.453
It doesn't matter.

10:23.487 --> 10:25.555
Yeah, Clyde, put together
a radical right-size proposal.

10:25.589 --> 10:27.524
We'll have it in our pocket
in case we need it.

10:27.559 --> 10:30.494
[Phone tune plays]

10:30.528 --> 10:33.363
Hello, principal Gita,
is everything okay?

10:33.398 --> 10:35.432
Yes, Mr. Kaan, lovely.

10:35.467 --> 10:37.202
It's a beautiful sunny day...

10:37.236 --> 10:39.371
Yes, but I'm in the middle
of something. Can you--

10:39.405 --> 10:41.807
Well, we had the auditions
for <i>grease</i> today.

10:41.841 --> 10:42.975
Yeah, I heard.

10:43.009 --> 10:44.876
And Roscoe was outstanding.

10:44.911 --> 10:46.345
Hi, good to see you.

10:46.379 --> 10:50.048
And Mrs. Borsiczky
decided to use him as Sandy.

10:50.083 --> 10:52.451
And that's great, isn't it?

10:52.485 --> 10:55.721
But another Sandy,
Brittany Kauffman--

10:55.755 --> 10:57.389
- Yeah, the pug.
- Pardon me?

10:57.423 --> 10:58.523
Nothing.

10:58.558 --> 11:00.025
Brittany was very disappointed.

11:00.059 --> 11:01.827
Brittany's mother
made the point

11:01.861 --> 11:03.995
that the part was given
to a boy

11:04.030 --> 11:06.998
and that there are plenty of
boys' parts in the show.

11:07.032 --> 11:09.300
Listen, he didn't audition
for a boy's part.

11:09.334 --> 11:10.868
He auditioned
for the part of Sandy.

11:10.902 --> 11:14.038
He wants to sing <i>summer nights</i>
and wear poodle skirt, okay?

11:14.072 --> 11:15.706
And he got the part of the Sandy
'cause he was the best Sandy.

11:15.741 --> 11:18.475
And now Brittany Kauffman's mom
can't stand it

11:18.509 --> 11:19.676
that her little baby
isn't getting

11:19.711 --> 11:20.978
every goddamn thing she wants,

11:21.012 --> 11:23.046
so she's off on some kind
of a gender witch hunt.

11:23.080 --> 11:24.414
Well, perhaps
you could come down.

11:24.448 --> 11:25.848
Gita, listen.

11:25.883 --> 11:29.252
My boy got the part of Sandy,
he's gonna play Sandy.

11:29.286 --> 11:31.154
Mr. Kaan?

11:31.188 --> 11:32.655
Congratulations.

11:32.689 --> 11:33.956
It's one of the pink ladies,
right?

11:33.991 --> 11:36.025
So, tell me more.
Tell me more.

11:36.060 --> 11:37.527
Did she put up a fight?

11:37.561 --> 11:40.363
[Laughs] Look, let's get
the fuck out of this fish bowl

11:40.397 --> 11:42.832
and see if we can find
some $1,000-sushi joint

11:42.866 --> 11:44.900
that we can bill
these assholes for.

11:44.935 --> 11:46.736
All right, just tell me this.
I'm curious.

11:46.770 --> 11:49.638
Why is it so important to you

11:49.672 --> 11:51.907
that I have some crazy secret

11:51.941 --> 11:53.541
that you're always
trying to figure out?

11:53.576 --> 11:55.443
Oh, well.
It's just 'cause I've,

11:55.478 --> 11:58.579
you know, analyzed it using my
very powerful regression model,

11:58.614 --> 12:00.914
and there's an 87% likelihood

12:00.949 --> 12:02.482
that we're gonna
sleep together, so...

12:02.517 --> 12:04.084
- Ha!
- Yeah, it's true.

12:04.118 --> 12:05.652
So we should just
get to know each other...

12:05.686 --> 12:07.988
- Grossly inaccurate.
- Get comfortable with the idea.

12:08.022 --> 12:09.523
- Wow.
- Avoid all that awkwardness

12:09.558 --> 12:11.225
later, like, "oh,
can I use your toothbrush?"

12:11.259 --> 12:12.592
- No.
- You want pepper on that?

12:12.627 --> 12:14.428
Is your poop-chute an option?

12:14.462 --> 12:15.862
- Oh, my God.
- What?

12:15.897 --> 12:17.631
It's so interesting,
because when I look at you...

12:17.665 --> 12:19.700
- Uh-huh.
- I honestly see sometimes

12:19.734 --> 12:22.535
like a decent-looking,
intelligent...

12:22.570 --> 12:24.071
Yes.

12:24.105 --> 12:26.039
You know, employed,
if over-educated guy...

12:26.074 --> 12:27.208
Thank you.

12:27.242 --> 12:29.443
And then...
You open your mouth,

12:29.478 --> 12:31.546
and the damage
just spills right out.

12:31.580 --> 12:33.548
And, Marty, I was
a business psych major,

12:33.582 --> 12:35.951
and I don't even wanna
tell you what I see.

12:35.985 --> 12:38.287
Whoa!
That sounds bad.

12:38.321 --> 12:42.525
No $1,000 sushi, but they do
have Vienna sausage and dip.

12:42.560 --> 12:43.760
And pussy.

to your, uh...

- Your, uh...
- Wife.

14:32.468 --> 14:34.769
- Wife?
- Your wife.

- His wife.
- My wife.

14:36.171 --> 14:37.472
Oh, yeah.
No, you didn't, uh...

14:37.506 --> 14:39.674
You didn't mention that you
brought your wife.

14:39.708 --> 14:41.109
- Oh, I thought that I'd--
- Baby...

14:41.143 --> 14:42.543

that I had mentioned that.

14:42.578 --> 14:44.245
No, I don't remember
that you mentioned it, no.

- Boom!
- Boom!

So I'm just getting
a cappuccino,

15:02.462 --> 15:04.696
Before everything
gets too hectic,

15:04.731 --> 15:06.231
we like to have
a little us-time.

15:06.266 --> 15:08.100
A little us-time, Greg.

15:08.134 --> 15:09.601
Oh, sweet.
You guys newlyweds?

15:09.636 --> 15:11.136
Hey, fuck it.

15:11.170 --> 15:13.472
Hey, I got an idea.
Double date tonight.

15:13.506 --> 15:15.307
Steaks and cocktails
to go over our takeaways

15:15.342 --> 15:17.243

What do you say?

15:17.277 --> 15:18.711
- Say yes.
- We've got that, uh...

15:18.745 --> 15:20.647
Resistance. Don't resist me.
You'll break my heart.

15:20.681 --> 15:22.349
- This is the way it's done.
- We'll be there, Greg.

15:22.383 --> 15:23.984
Man, I like her, Marty.

15:24.019 --> 15:27.120
She's a keeper--I like her
more than you like her.

15:27.155 --> 15:29.256
- And see you guys, tonight.
- All right, Greg.

15:29.290 --> 15:30.991
Take it easy, buddy.
Wait a minute, listen.

15:31.025 --> 15:32.626
This isn't a fucking game,
okay?

15:32.660 --> 15:34.294
These guys
are gonna eat you alive.

15:34.328 --> 15:37.263
We'll see about that.

15:37.297 --> 15:38.931
[Distant siren blaring]

we're completely screwed.

15:42.302 --> 15:43.902
No, we're not.
You gotta trust daddy.

15:43.936 --> 15:45.937
When he comes in here,
he's gonna kill it.

15:45.971 --> 15:48.073
Speak of the devil.

15:48.107 --> 15:50.142
Jesus Christ.

15:50.176 --> 15:51.510
He's in the same
fucking clothes.

15:51.544 --> 15:53.746
- Kiddies.
- Hey, daddy.

15:53.780 --> 15:55.515
What could you possibly
be doing here this early?

15:55.549 --> 15:57.150
Not banging strippers?

15:57.184 --> 15:58.819
Good answer.
But it just so happens

15:58.853 --> 16:02.423
that I had a very important
pre-dawn meeting

16:02.457 --> 16:04.625
full of strategery
with one Mr. Greg Norbert.

16:04.660 --> 16:05.827
Bullshit.

16:05.861 --> 16:07.028
And we are--
Is that coffee?

16:07.062 --> 16:09.129
- Yeah, I--
- Having dinner tonight

16:09.164 --> 16:10.831
to put our last bits
of spit and Polish

16:10.865 --> 16:12.533
on our presentation
to Mr. McDale.

16:12.567 --> 16:13.834
Thank you.

16:13.869 --> 16:15.803
Hold on. You're
having dinner with Norbert?

16:15.837 --> 16:17.271
- Absolutely.
- That's great.

16:17.306 --> 16:19.174
Mm-hmm. He's very anxious
to meet my wife.

16:19.208 --> 16:20.475
Your what?

16:20.509 --> 16:21.943
Here's the thing.
You don't have a wife.

16:21.978 --> 16:23.678
Ha! Please tell me you're not
bringing a stripper

16:23.713 --> 16:25.847
to a business dinner.
Stripper wife.

16:25.882 --> 16:27.282
- Why am I high-fiving that?
- Yeah.

16:27.316 --> 16:28.817
Oh, is that me?

16:28.852 --> 16:30.519
I would rather work at Arby's.

16:30.553 --> 16:32.388
That can be arranged,
Jeannie bean.

16:32.422 --> 16:34.790
All right, let's get busy.

16:34.824 --> 16:36.858
We need to pull every nasty
thing anyone in the world

16:36.893 --> 16:39.028
has ever said about
Metrocapital fast.

16:39.062 --> 16:41.330
- How would that possibly--
- Just trust me, please.

16:41.364 --> 16:42.731
Trust you.

16:51.941 --> 16:54.343
Fuck me.

16:56.846 --> 16:58.747
Hmm, hi sweetie.

16:58.781 --> 17:01.083
- Fuckin' double-booked.

17:04.220 --> 17:06.354
Double-booked is not good,

17:06.388 --> 17:09.190
especially when you're the ones
they double-booked on.

17:09.224 --> 17:11.193
Especially when the company
they double-booked

17:11.227 --> 17:14.162
is the number one firm in
the country to your number two.

17:14.196 --> 17:17.265
Especially when they employ
your crazy ex-wife

17:17.300 --> 17:20.068
who you just angry-banged.

17:20.103 --> 17:23.372
Probably the best fucking closer
in the world.

17:23.406 --> 17:27.176
You know, getting double-booked
on is one big fat fuck you.

17:30.415 --> 17:32.449
Yeah, I'm sorry.
That's never fun.

17:32.484 --> 17:34.118
It doesn't really happen to us,

17:34.153 --> 17:36.454
but from what I understand,
it's a real bummer.

17:36.489 --> 17:37.622
Oh, it just
happened to you, baby.

17:37.657 --> 17:38.824
Just because
they double-booked

17:38.858 --> 17:40.025
doesn't mean
they shit-canned us.

17:40.060 --> 17:41.527
Yet.

17:41.562 --> 17:44.397
So, Olivia Newton-John, huh?

17:44.431 --> 17:46.432
- Wow, super-mom.
You're in the loop.

17:46.467 --> 17:48.034
Well, you know,
he still loves me,

17:48.069 --> 17:50.470
even if I forget to love him.

17:52.907 --> 17:54.608
You just let him flounce around
like it's a done deal.

17:54.642 --> 17:56.976
Oh, well, our son
is a tranny for life.

17:57.011 --> 17:59.045
He's experimenting
with different expressions

17:59.080 --> 18:01.381
- of gender identification.
- Oh, my God.

18:01.415 --> 18:03.416
I can actually see your dad's
hand shoved up your ass,

18:03.450 --> 18:04.917
working your mouth
like a little sock puppet.

18:04.952 --> 18:07.753
He keeps the kid sane,
you fucking psycho.

18:09.256 --> 18:10.456
Good luck, cunties.

18:11.791 --> 18:14.293
Which one of you is she fucking?
Or is it a group thing?

18:20.866 --> 18:23.834
Hello?

18:23.868 --> 18:25.402
Fair enough.

18:25.437 --> 18:28.005
Um...

18:28.040 --> 18:30.775
Can I ask you some questions
about these guys?

18:30.809 --> 18:33.744
How long have you lived
out here?

18:43.556 --> 18:45.624
- You look good.
- You too.

18:45.658 --> 18:48.127
Do I look like a stripper?

18:49.696 --> 18:50.930
[Laughs] No.

18:50.965 --> 18:52.466
Escort.
High-end.

18:52.500 --> 18:54.368
Come on.

18:54.402 --> 18:55.602
Thank you, Greg.

18:55.637 --> 18:57.004
You got all you want?
Look that that.

18:57.039 --> 18:58.139
- Oh.
- Boom.

18:58.173 --> 18:59.607
Kaboom, kabab, kadunk.

18:59.641 --> 19:01.175
Oh, there we go.
Look it, that's the timing.

19:01.210 --> 19:02.443
- That's the secret to...
- Lovely.

19:02.478 --> 19:04.646
I can tell you do
a lot of pilates.

19:04.680 --> 19:06.614
Yes.

19:06.649 --> 19:08.183
A lot.

19:08.217 --> 19:09.718
Almost nonstop.

19:09.753 --> 19:12.254
I can tell.

19:12.288 --> 19:13.789
So Marty,
what do you got for us?

19:13.823 --> 19:15.024
Anything dazzling?

19:15.058 --> 19:16.492
All the guys
in the consulting biz

19:16.526 --> 19:18.827
say you're the guy
for outside the box.

19:18.862 --> 19:21.497
Now, why do people say
"outside the box"

19:21.531 --> 19:22.897
to describe outside the box

19:22.932 --> 19:27.235
when the term "outside the box"
is so inside the box?

19:27.269 --> 19:29.337
[Laughter]

19:29.371 --> 19:31.907
All right,
I'm gonna go to the ladies.

19:31.941 --> 19:33.842
I'll go with you.

19:33.876 --> 19:36.044
All right then.

19:37.547 --> 19:40.916
Oh, Marty, she's insanely hot.

19:40.950 --> 19:44.319
Yeah.
Well, Rachel is also...Foine.

19:44.354 --> 19:46.355
Yeah, she's a dead lay.

19:46.389 --> 19:48.423
- Really?
- Oh, yeah.

19:48.457 --> 19:49.959
Dead on arrival.

19:53.597 --> 19:55.331
Oh.

20:00.070 --> 20:02.204
Wow!

20:02.239 --> 20:04.339
What about Greg?

20:04.374 --> 20:06.975
I woke up
a week into the marriage

20:07.009 --> 20:09.878
and realized
I really like girls

20:09.912 --> 20:11.513
in a way
that isn't part-time.

20:20.555 --> 20:22.555
[Pearls clattering] [Gasps]

20:22.589 --> 20:25.091
Nobody's is getting fired.
Yet.

20:25.125 --> 20:26.793
Look, I am pulling for you.
I'm 100%.

20:26.827 --> 20:28.294
But?

20:28.328 --> 20:30.696
But McDale thinks
Kinsley-Johnson's gonna deliver.

20:30.731 --> 20:33.266
Why them and not us?
Is it a ranking thing?

20:33.300 --> 20:34.767
They're ranked one,
we're ranked two?

20:34.801 --> 20:36.336
You know, it's because
they're the firm

20:36.370 --> 20:38.037
that does the ranking, right?
You know that, right, Greg?

20:38.072 --> 20:39.939
I look at the proposals
side by side-- That's all.

20:39.973 --> 20:41.474
He's leaning towards
Kinsley-Johnson.

20:41.508 --> 20:42.942
I'm not gonna lie to you.
I don't wanna bullshit you.

20:42.977 --> 20:44.311
I don't want you to get
blindsided.

20:44.345 --> 20:45.679
But here's the thing Kinsley
doesn't know--

20:45.713 --> 20:47.080
He's already thinking about

20:47.114 --> 20:49.649
a three-year transitional
engagement.

20:49.684 --> 20:52.419
Boom!
That's a shitload afterwork.

20:53.788 --> 20:55.722
Does McDale put any stock
in your opinion?

20:55.756 --> 20:57.758
- Oh, yeah, fucking-a.
- Okay, good.

20:57.792 --> 20:59.826
Then you're not influenced
by which way he's leaning.

20:59.861 --> 21:01.161
He's the CEO of the company.

21:01.195 --> 21:03.130
Jesus Christ, Greg,
does any original thought

21:03.164 --> 21:05.298
happen inside that sterile
fucking environment,

21:05.332 --> 21:07.166
or is it just a bunch
of you guys ass-licking?

21:07.201 --> 21:08.968
- There's no ass-licking.
- Are you your own man?

21:09.003 --> 21:10.170
I'm my own man!

21:12.272 --> 21:13.806
The...

21:15.709 --> 21:17.143
Your hair is all...

21:17.177 --> 21:18.310
Oh.

21:18.345 --> 21:19.913
I thought you guys fell in.

21:19.947 --> 21:21.447
Almost.

21:21.482 --> 21:23.349
Girl talk.

21:25.652 --> 21:28.153
I can't believe they haven't
stormed the building

21:28.188 --> 21:30.289
and strung you all up
by the nuts.

21:30.323 --> 21:32.191
- Oh, give me a break.
- I agree!

21:32.225 --> 21:34.426
Toast!
Oh, please.

21:34.461 --> 21:35.828
Hmm? Hmm?
Right? Right? Yes.

21:35.862 --> 21:37.229
A bunch of fucking babies.

21:37.264 --> 21:39.031
I mean, they love us
when the market's firing,

21:39.065 --> 21:41.099
and every dumbshit community
college dropout

21:41.133 --> 21:43.034
has a mortgage and an Escalade.

21:43.068 --> 21:45.436
Oh, God, nice, Greg.
You fucking elitist.

21:45.470 --> 21:46.804
It's fucking--
It's true, man.

21:46.838 --> 21:48.306
They can't handle it
when the shit bottoms out,

21:48.340 --> 21:50.207
and they have to actually
use a brain cell

21:50.242 --> 21:52.009
to make a fuckin' dollar!

21:52.043 --> 21:54.445
I mean, cowboy the fuck up!

21:54.479 --> 21:55.613
- Yeah.
- Hey.

21:55.647 --> 21:57.882
Right.
You are such a pig.

21:57.916 --> 21:59.350
I'm a pig.
Oh, you have--

21:59.384 --> 22:01.386
Well, you know, I don't see you
complaining about the cars,

22:01.420 --> 22:03.354
the houses, and the netjet
and the boat...

22:03.388 --> 22:04.856
- No, no, no...
- Not the boat.

22:04.890 --> 22:08.126
She made me come more in
a toilet stall in six minutes

22:08.160 --> 22:10.729
than you have
in the past three years!

22:14.435 --> 22:16.002
What the fuck are you saying?

22:16.037 --> 22:19.240
I was squirting, Greg!

22:19.274 --> 22:21.842
- Oh, my God.
- What?

22:21.876 --> 22:24.678
[Whispering] What is squirting?

22:24.713 --> 22:26.247
You what?

22:26.281 --> 22:28.716
Well, this is...

22:28.750 --> 22:30.684
It was really nice to meet you.

22:30.719 --> 22:32.353
I'll see you tomorrow
at the office.

22:32.387 --> 22:34.422
- What the fuck are you--
- I have to--

22:34.456 --> 22:37.491
- Oh, take it easy, guys.
- Take your hands off me.

22:37.525 --> 22:39.593
Let go, let go of me.

22:39.628 --> 22:42.763
Aah!
My fucking eye!

22:42.798 --> 22:44.498
- Stop it.
- Fuck you.

22:44.533 --> 22:45.599
Let go of my leg!

22:45.634 --> 22:47.368
I'm my own man.

23:05.387 --> 23:08.055
So, Jeannie, you, uh,

23:08.089 --> 23:10.791
said you didn't wanna tell me
what you saw the other night.

23:10.825 --> 23:12.225
I'm a big boy.
Tell me what you see.

23:12.259 --> 23:14.360
- Not now, asshole.
- Why not?

23:14.395 --> 23:16.962
Because I wouldn't want you
to head butt me or anything.

23:16.997 --> 23:18.597
Or you only do that
to the client?

23:18.631 --> 23:20.032
Oh, come on, tell me.

23:20.066 --> 23:22.801
Best shot.

23:24.003 --> 23:25.737
All right.
Um...

23:25.772 --> 23:30.642
Someone who is so afraid
that they can barely function.

23:30.676 --> 23:34.412
Let alone have an authentic
moment with another human being.

23:34.447 --> 23:35.981
And so you insulate yourself
with your numbers

23:36.015 --> 23:38.583
and your models
and your formulae.

23:38.618 --> 23:41.219
You got me.

23:41.254 --> 23:43.422
- You know what the real fear is?
- What?

23:43.456 --> 23:46.492
That some earnest barnard grad
is gonna try to use

23:46.526 --> 23:49.194
their overpriced bullshit
therapy on me.

23:49.228 --> 23:50.261
- It's Columbia.
- What?

23:50.296 --> 23:51.729
What?
It's Columbia.

23:51.764 --> 23:52.897
- Oh.
- Mm-hmm.

23:52.932 --> 23:56.134
Hey, remember that foolproof
computer model

23:56.168 --> 23:57.835
that told you
that we were gonna have sex?

23:57.870 --> 24:00.172
Yes, I do.
Doug helped me with that.

24:00.206 --> 24:01.473
Hey.

24:01.507 --> 24:03.275
Okay, here's the deal.

24:03.309 --> 24:05.778
In order for a computer model
to be worth a crap,

24:05.812 --> 24:07.780
it has to begin with
credible information.

24:07.814 --> 24:10.950
And, for starters...I am never
gonna sleep with you.

24:10.984 --> 24:13.786
And you know all your fear
and self-loathing

24:13.821 --> 24:15.822
and "I'm a piece of shit at
the center of the universe"?

24:15.856 --> 24:18.992
That's about
your mom's suicide, Marty.

24:19.026 --> 24:24.163
- Who the fuck told you--
- I guessed.

24:24.198 --> 24:26.198
Clyde told me.

24:30.637 --> 24:33.306
[Sighs] Well...

24:33.340 --> 24:36.709
We're definitely
gonna sleep together now.

24:36.743 --> 24:38.311
Pity bang.

24:38.345 --> 24:41.414
[Applause]

24:43.383 --> 24:44.784
[Laughs]

24:44.818 --> 24:46.152
Good luck.

24:48.555 --> 24:49.522
Oh, they were good.

24:49.557 --> 24:51.058
But you got dressed up
so pretty,

24:51.092 --> 24:52.493
let's give this a shot.

24:53.829 --> 24:55.196
Gentlemen.

24:57.533 --> 24:59.734
We're running over,
so let's keep this moving, huh?

24:59.769 --> 25:01.169
Oh, absolutely.
Awesome.

25:01.204 --> 25:02.938
This shouldn't
take a lot of time,

25:02.972 --> 25:04.840
because I'm not gonna do
the whole hand job thing

25:04.874 --> 25:06.308
that the Kinsley group
just did,

25:06.342 --> 25:08.944
you know, stroke the shaft,
cradle the balls,

25:08.978 --> 25:11.580
maybe a finger up the ass,
Greg, squirt?

25:11.614 --> 25:15.484
Now, I'm sure that they told you
that Metrocapital is synonymous

25:15.519 --> 25:18.320
with ethical trading and that
legally, you can't be touched.

25:18.355 --> 25:20.823
They told you to just do
some image spots,

25:20.857 --> 25:23.792
go ahead and take
your bonuses, right?

25:23.827 --> 25:26.028
Let me know how that goes.

25:27.764 --> 25:30.833
Those on wall street
cannot resume taking risks

25:30.867 --> 25:32.901
without regard
for consequences.

25:32.935 --> 25:35.470
Too many were motivated only by

25:35.504 --> 25:38.740
the appetite for quick kills
and bloated bonuses.

25:38.774 --> 25:40.875
I think it's as serious
a situation

25:40.910 --> 25:45.080
as this country has faced
since the great depression.

25:45.114 --> 25:46.881
And I lost my job and...

25:46.916 --> 25:49.184
We lost our house as well.

25:49.218 --> 25:51.520
I had a beautiful
four-bedroom home.

25:51.554 --> 25:54.856
You're paying off, like,
fat bonuses to everybody else.

25:54.891 --> 25:56.158
I am so angry.

25:56.192 --> 25:57.893
Now we have to use
their college funds

25:57.927 --> 26:00.596
to pay the debt on a house that
we don't even live in anymore.

26:00.630 --> 26:03.565
McDale and his Metrocapital
fuckers,

26:03.600 --> 26:05.434
you should be ashamed
of yourself.

26:05.468 --> 26:07.703
I don't hate anybody,
but he's close.

26:07.737 --> 26:09.771
Metrocapital
can go fuck themselves.

26:09.805 --> 26:11.706
Two great big fuck yous.

26:11.740 --> 26:12.706
[Mouthing] Fuck you.

26:12.741 --> 26:13.941
Fuck off.

26:13.975 --> 26:15.809
Those bastards
at Metrocapital--

26:15.844 --> 26:17.377
Fuck you all.

26:17.412 --> 26:19.312
Thanks a lot.

26:21.182 --> 26:25.451
Yeah,
America fuckin' hates you.

26:25.486 --> 26:28.054
I don't know what the hell
is the matter with you.

26:28.088 --> 26:29.789
Look at the screen.

26:40.835 --> 26:42.635
Get them out of here.

26:42.670 --> 26:44.270
Oh, come on, K. Warren.

26:44.305 --> 26:45.739
Just look at the actual
"amnesty program."

26:45.773 --> 26:48.474
I'm not interested
in any amnesty program.

26:48.509 --> 26:50.576
Well, you're definitely
interested in something.

26:50.611 --> 26:52.178
I mean, otherwise,
why would you be looking at

26:52.212 --> 26:53.279
a three-year transitional...

26:53.313 --> 26:54.813
- Transit--

26:54.848 --> 26:56.448
- D-- No?
- Uh--

26:56.482 --> 26:59.151
Oh, it doesn't matter.
I'll take it from here, Greg.

26:59.185 --> 27:01.186
[Clears throat] Now,
we've spent the last few days

27:01.220 --> 27:03.354
crawling up the heiny-end
of Metro-Crapital

27:03.389 --> 27:04.689
and back out its mouth.

27:04.723 --> 27:06.023
We know that you are
on the verge--

27:06.057 --> 27:07.758
And it is a very real verge--

27:07.793 --> 27:10.262
Of watching Joe six-pack
and hockey mom

27:10.296 --> 27:12.631
take their meager earnings
elsewhere.

27:12.665 --> 27:16.135
We are looking at a potential
40% falloff in customer loyalty.

27:16.169 --> 27:18.971
Now, that is roughly
$940 billion

27:19.006 --> 27:22.042
on an annual amort.
Ouchies.

27:22.076 --> 27:24.544
Which will, of course, mean
a crippling domino effect

27:24.579 --> 27:26.847
to your wholesale business,
so, you know...

27:26.882 --> 27:28.482
Exponential ouchies.

27:28.517 --> 27:30.318
Now, you may not care
about these customers--

27:30.352 --> 27:31.819
[whispers] I know I don't.

27:31.854 --> 27:34.123
But the fact remains
if they jump ship,

27:34.157 --> 27:36.358
you will have nothing to finance
your little sorties

27:36.393 --> 27:39.228
into the land of risky
and potentially lucrative

27:39.263 --> 27:40.563
financial instruments.

27:40.597 --> 27:42.065
So what are you gonna do?

27:42.100 --> 27:44.134
You're gonna puss out, flee
to your houses in St. Barts,

27:44.168 --> 27:46.403
hire a private security force?

27:46.437 --> 27:48.004
Not just yet.
After the announcement,

27:48.038 --> 27:50.340
we will roll out
the amnesty applications.

27:50.375 --> 27:52.276
We estimate an initial
surge to market

27:52.310 --> 27:54.044
of about 17 million applicants.

27:54.079 --> 27:55.946
And after the initial
disqualifications,

27:55.981 --> 27:58.048
we're left with about
9 million remaining.

27:58.082 --> 27:59.950
Then the applications
will go through processing

27:59.985 --> 28:03.654
with another 8,800,000
eliminated.

28:03.688 --> 28:05.689
Nearly half of which will be due
to good old inertia

28:05.723 --> 28:07.490
and lack of follow-through.

28:07.525 --> 28:09.392
Then a final fraud comb
will go through

28:09.427 --> 28:11.594
along with the series
of technical DQS--

28:11.629 --> 28:13.363
6% mortality DQS.

28:13.397 --> 28:15.065
It's your basic
bump and grab, guys.

28:15.099 --> 28:16.766
You have a mark--
The customer.

28:16.801 --> 28:19.235
A jostler bumps into them,
creates a distraction.

28:19.270 --> 28:21.204
That's the amnesty program.

28:21.239 --> 28:24.007
And the grab--that's you all
taking your bonuses

28:24.041 --> 28:26.543
while they're all admiring
your amnesty program.

28:26.577 --> 28:28.078
By the time
all the paperwork's in,

28:28.112 --> 28:30.380
you'll pay out about 50,000
full writedowns.

28:30.415 --> 28:31.882
- Total cost?
- About as much as

28:31.916 --> 28:34.451
- your Kinsley image spots.
- When can you implement?

28:34.485 --> 28:37.053
We can schedule a press
conference for Monday morning.

28:37.088 --> 28:39.056
And...
[Whispers] Your bonuses?

28:39.090 --> 28:40.958
Belly up,
and take 'em Monday afternoon.

28:40.992 --> 28:43.260
Galweather and stern will walk
you through the entire affair.

28:43.295 --> 28:44.629
