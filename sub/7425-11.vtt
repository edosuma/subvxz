<i>Beauty & the Beast...</i>

00:03.046 --> 00:04.279
Where's the shackle?

00:04.380 --> 00:05.580
I was hired
to steal it.

00:05.681 --> 00:07.048
What do they want with it?

00:07.149 --> 00:08.850
It goes with the gem.

00:08.951 --> 00:10.585
Five minutes, tops,
to get the gem out of the safe.

00:10.686 --> 00:13.588
Don't cross me, Catherine, okay?
I mean it.

00:13.689 --> 00:15.423
Yeah, well, don't make me
shoot you again, Vincent.

00:15.524 --> 00:16.958
And I mean that.

00:21.564 --> 00:22.830
What happened to you?

00:24.166 --> 00:25.699
Is this the gem

00:25.801 --> 00:26.934
that they
were after?

00:27.035 --> 00:28.136
London, 1836.

00:28.237 --> 00:30.571
Is that the same gem?

00:30.672 --> 00:32.706
Look who was
helping Scotland Yard.

00:32.808 --> 00:34.208
Rebecca Reynolds.

00:34.309 --> 00:36.077
You think I'm related
to this woman?

00:36.178 --> 00:37.278
It's a collar.

00:37.379 --> 00:38.246
What does it do?

00:38.346 --> 00:39.546
Too bad you can't ask

00:39.648 --> 00:40.714
whoever hired
the gang to get it.

00:40.815 --> 00:42.215
Well, I will.

00:42.317 --> 00:43.484
I'll find them,

00:43.585 --> 00:45.118
because obviously
they know a lot more

00:45.219 --> 00:47.087
about my beast side than I do.

00:47.188 --> 00:49.356
When my wire went dead,
you trusted me.

01:33.800 --> 01:37.136
Tori and Vincent
at two separate parties,

01:37.237 --> 01:39.205
and she's wearing that necklace.

01:39.306 --> 01:41.373
What is he thinking,
parading her around

01:41.474 --> 01:42.708
with a stolen
necklace?

01:42.809 --> 01:43.976
<i>Not</i> thinking, clearly.

01:44.077 --> 01:46.211
Or maybe he is.

01:46.312 --> 01:47.646
Somebody's been hiring gangs,

01:47.747 --> 01:49.027
killing people trying to get it.

01:49.114 --> 01:50.482
Vincent said himself

01:50.583 --> 01:52.150
that he wants to figure out
who it is.

01:52.251 --> 01:53.852
So maybe he's trying
to lure them out.

01:53.953 --> 01:55.620
Or he's out on the town
with his new girlfriend,

01:55.722 --> 01:57.456
enjoying their
recent freedom.

01:57.557 --> 01:59.391
Either way, we
are throwing Tess

01:59.492 --> 02:02.526
a surprise party
in less than six hours,

02:02.627 --> 02:04.562
and I need to figure out
where to hang this...

02:04.663 --> 02:05.864
cheesy banner.

02:05.965 --> 02:08.366
Did you buy that for this?

02:08.467 --> 02:10.800
Well, you said Tess lives
for her birthday, so...

02:10.902 --> 02:12.237
Gabe...

02:12.338 --> 02:13.738
It was $4.99.

02:13.839 --> 02:15.907
No, but it's sweet
and it's thoughtful...

02:20.612 --> 02:23.213
So I was thinking
over by the front door.

02:23.314 --> 02:25.349
Or is that bad,
because Tess'll see it?

02:25.450 --> 02:27.050
No, it'll ruin
the surprise.

02:27.151 --> 02:30.087
Okay, um...

02:30.188 --> 02:31.722
did I miss my window?

02:31.823 --> 02:33.557
I mean,
recently you've

02:33.658 --> 02:35.225
put it out there that

02:35.326 --> 02:37.494
you feel like there's more
between us, but...

02:37.595 --> 02:39.029
I have.

02:39.130 --> 02:40.764
And there is.

02:40.865 --> 02:43.367
It's just, y-you
seem like you're...

02:43.467 --> 02:44.935
What?

02:45.036 --> 02:47.004
Is this because I
brought in that paper?

02:47.105 --> 02:48.372
I'm not jealous.

02:48.472 --> 02:50.007
I am over Vincent.

02:50.108 --> 02:52.108
I can't believe I was ever
with somebody like that.

02:52.142 --> 02:54.844
I mean, last week, he chose
a necklace over a human life.

02:54.945 --> 02:56.178
He's unrecognizable.

02:56.280 --> 02:57.520
I was going to say
it seems like

02:57.615 --> 02:58.882
you have some
unresolved anger.

02:58.982 --> 03:00.617
Yeah, well,
maybe that's because

03:00.718 --> 03:02.452
he's running
a competing investigation

03:02.553 --> 03:04.120
with <i>my</i> necklace.

03:04.221 --> 03:05.789
Your necklace?

03:05.890 --> 03:07.123
These are the files that
Agent Landon gave me.

03:07.224 --> 03:08.391
Turns out

03:08.491 --> 03:10.259
that my relative
Rebecca Reynolds

03:10.360 --> 03:11.527
was in possession
of that necklace.

03:11.628 --> 03:14.063
Right, 200 years ago.

03:14.164 --> 03:15.531
Yeah, when she was investigating

03:15.632 --> 03:17.733
a string of murders
that look like maulings.

03:17.834 --> 03:19.435
So this
isn't about

03:19.536 --> 03:21.870
unresolved feelings
for Vincent.

03:21.972 --> 03:24.640
I'm starting to feel like this
has to do with who I am.

03:24.741 --> 03:27.576
And I have to figure out
what all of this means.

03:27.677 --> 03:29.745
But that
necklace?

03:29.846 --> 03:31.480
It's my only lead.

03:31.581 --> 03:33.214
So, yes, I am angry

03:33.316 --> 03:34.750
that he has it and I don't.

03:36.085 --> 03:38.787
Agent Landon.

03:38.888 --> 03:41.889
Maybe she has something
to make you less angry.

03:41.991 --> 03:43.258
Check this out.

03:46.895 --> 03:47.762
That's your lead?

03:49.498 --> 03:50.966
It's just...
that's Tori Windsor.

03:51.067 --> 03:52.434
We know her, we worked
her kidnapping case.

03:52.534 --> 03:54.002
Well, I want you to arrest her.

03:54.103 --> 03:55.437
Bring her here?

03:55.537 --> 03:57.005
To the precinct?

03:57.106 --> 03:58.072
They tracked her phone

03:58.173 --> 03:59.607
to the 79th Street Boat Basin.

03:59.708 --> 04:00.842
Do you not see
the necklace she's wearing?

04:00.943 --> 04:03.243
Wow.

04:03.345 --> 04:04.812
"Wow"?

04:04.913 --> 04:07.147
My field office verified
it's the identical one

04:07.248 --> 04:08.916
stolen from
the Russian consulate.

04:09.017 --> 04:10.317
If Tori Windsor isn't the person

04:10.418 --> 04:11.586
behind these heists,
then she's definitely

04:11.687 --> 04:13.187
connected to
whoever is.

04:13.288 --> 04:15.408
I don't get why you guys
aren't jumping all over this.

04:15.423 --> 04:16.589
I think what
you're sensing, Dana,

04:16.690 --> 04:18.125
is we're all
not sure whether

04:18.226 --> 04:19.994
bringing someone like Tori
in is the best strategy.

04:20.095 --> 04:22.296
I mean, she's just gonna lawyer up,
and then where will we be?

04:22.397 --> 04:25.299
Yeah, and if we're wrong, we've
brought in this young socialite...

04:25.400 --> 04:26.268
Yeah, who was just a
kidnapping victim...

04:26.293 --> 04:27.301
Father died.

04:27.302 --> 04:29.463
Paper will say we harassed
her, the press'll skewer us.

04:30.805 --> 04:32.438
Okay, point taken.

04:32.540 --> 04:33.840
Start with questioning.
Great.

04:33.941 --> 04:34.675
Best call ever.

04:34.676 --> 04:36.244
Just bring in that necklace.

04:37.798 --> 04:38.663
<i>You realize that Vincent's</i>

04:38.664 --> 04:40.061
<i>not just gonna hand it over,</i>
<i>right?</i>

04:40.062 --> 04:40.993
He doesn't have a choice.

04:40.994 --> 04:42.601
Dana'll send in
a SWAT team to get it.

04:42.602 --> 04:43.969
Bright side,
you get your necklace back.

04:44.090 --> 04:45.530
Why can't we just
let SWAT handle it?

04:45.611 --> 04:47.123
Because if someone
gets hurt, that's on us.

04:47.202 --> 04:48.335
Hey.

04:48.955 --> 04:49.788
Oh, oh, by the way,

04:49.789 --> 04:52.057
I, uh... I got the cake.

04:52.659 --> 04:53.859
What cake?

04:55.229 --> 04:57.563
Um...

04:57.664 --> 04:59.198
we are gonna come
back here after work,

04:59.299 --> 05:00.533
we're gonna have a little cake,
right, Freddy?

05:00.634 --> 05:03.169
Yeah, exactly,
that's what I meant, uh...

05:03.270 --> 05:04.870
We'll see you back
here later for cake.

05:04.971 --> 05:07.072
Okay.

05:07.173 --> 05:08.473
You guys throwing
me a party?

05:08.575 --> 05:09.975
What party?

05:10.076 --> 05:11.544
You're totally
throwing me a party.

05:11.645 --> 05:13.311
And here I am going
to a boat basin.

05:13.413 --> 05:15.080
Haven't even showered.
Okay, she's right.

05:15.181 --> 05:16.749
Instead of
having a shower,

05:16.850 --> 05:18.383
getting her hair done,
and finding a cute dress

05:18.484 --> 05:19.818
to wear to
her birthday,

05:19.920 --> 05:21.186
she's dealing with
another Vincent mess,

05:21.287 --> 05:23.088
and yes, I-I blew the
surprise because of him.

05:23.156 --> 05:24.876
Yeah, I already kind
of knew about it, so...

05:24.957 --> 05:26.091
Well, fan-friggin-tastic.

05:26.192 --> 05:27.359
Maybe you should
hang back.

05:27.460 --> 05:29.361
No, I am fine.
You sure?

05:29.462 --> 05:30.728
Because once we set
foot on this houseboat,

05:30.829 --> 05:31.996
we need
to remain calm.

05:32.098 --> 05:33.265
Yes, I will be fine.

05:33.366 --> 05:34.533
I could walk in on them
in flagrante,

05:34.633 --> 05:35.767
and I would be fine.

05:35.868 --> 05:36.668
I wouldn't.

05:36.769 --> 05:37.902
Not what I was referring to,

05:38.003 --> 05:39.170
but interesting
that you went there.

05:39.271 --> 05:40.672
Okay, but you said houseboat.

05:40.773 --> 05:42.707
And I keep telling you,
I'm not unresolved.

05:42.808 --> 05:44.709
Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait.

05:44.810 --> 05:47.111
Did you guys have, like,
a relationship conversation?

05:47.212 --> 05:49.047
Yes.

05:49.147 --> 05:50.548
Can we not do this right now?

05:50.649 --> 05:51.883
See, I'm calm.

05:51.984 --> 05:53.250
I vented... I am now calm.

06:02.494 --> 06:04.128
It's a houseboat.

06:04.229 --> 06:06.263
They are in slip J 25.

06:14.171 --> 06:15.572
Okay, remember
to find out

06:15.673 --> 06:17.574
who they work
for first, okay?

06:21.813 --> 06:22.713
Oh, no. Tori!

06:22.814 --> 06:24.581
Tori!

06:26.484 --> 06:28.718
- Get down.
I-I didn't know it was you.

06:28.819 --> 06:30.539
I didn't know it was you.
Put your hands up.

06:33.257 --> 06:35.492
Or what, you're gonna
shoot her as well?

06:35.593 --> 06:37.260
You cannot attack an officer.

06:37.361 --> 06:38.661
Everyone needs
to stay calm.

06:38.762 --> 06:40.296
She's the one
with the gun.

06:42.166 --> 06:43.398
Uh, we're in the middle
of something, okay?

06:43.500 --> 06:44.767
So you "officers,"
you need to leave.

06:44.868 --> 06:46.002
Yeah, well, we're in the middle

06:46.103 --> 06:47.469
of something, too, so...

06:47.570 --> 06:49.005
Cat, the gun.

06:51.541 --> 06:53.242
We just need you
to hand over the necklace.

06:53.343 --> 06:55.077
That's what
this is about.

06:55.178 --> 06:57.579
Yeah.
You wanted to lure bad guys

06:57.681 --> 06:58.814
with those splashy photos
of the two of you?

06:58.915 --> 07:00.015
Well, congratulations.

07:00.116 --> 07:01.816
You also lured the FBI,

07:01.917 --> 07:03.452
who ordered us to retrieve it.

07:03.553 --> 07:04.686
FBI, huh?

07:04.787 --> 07:05.820
That's right.

07:05.921 --> 07:07.088
And if we don't bring it in,

07:07.190 --> 07:08.357
they're gonna be back.

07:08.458 --> 07:10.091
And then what?
You gonna go on the run?

07:10.193 --> 07:12.861
No more parties, fancy clothes,
red carpets...

07:12.962 --> 07:14.763
You can't risk exposure.

07:14.864 --> 07:17.105
Just give us the necklace,
and we'll get out of your way.

07:19.401 --> 07:20.769
Uh, no.

07:20.870 --> 07:22.370
Don't.

07:23.873 --> 07:26.141
Okay, fine.
We did this the "calm" way.

07:26.241 --> 07:27.475
Tori, you're under arrest.

07:27.576 --> 07:29.477
- Wait, for what?
- For possession

07:29.578 --> 07:31.379
of stolen property and
assaulting an officer. Tess...

07:31.480 --> 07:32.713
You can't arrest her.

07:32.814 --> 07:34.448
What if she
loses control?

07:34.550 --> 07:35.783
She'll be
exposed.

07:35.884 --> 07:36.784
Well, you should have thought
of that

07:36.885 --> 07:37.885
before you used her as bait.

07:37.986 --> 07:38.886
Don't you two amplify
each other?

07:38.987 --> 07:40.120
You should stay here.

07:40.222 --> 07:41.689
- Or what?
- Or we arrest you, too.

07:41.790 --> 07:43.357
Disorderly conduct.

07:43.458 --> 07:44.625
Oh, come on.

07:44.726 --> 07:46.047
This is
a complete abuse of power!

07:46.094 --> 07:47.828
Come on, Tori, let's go.

The necklace?

08:05.998 --> 08:08.266
Couldn't tell
if she was still wearing it.

08:08.367 --> 08:09.834
Yeah, the war hero was there.

08:09.935 --> 08:12.370
All right, got it.

08:15.174 --> 08:17.475
Let's go.

08:21.180 --> 08:22.714
How about a drink?

08:22.815 --> 08:24.281
No, thanks.

08:24.382 --> 08:26.383
Not a lot in here.

08:26.484 --> 08:28.019
Too bad we're not at my place.

08:28.120 --> 08:29.721
I got enough booze
for a frat party.

08:32.957 --> 08:34.926
Nah, it's for Tess'
surprise birthday party.

08:35.027 --> 08:37.394
Then maybe you should go
get a drink there, then.

08:39.163 --> 08:40.864
What <i>are</i> you doing here?

08:40.965 --> 08:43.066
Making sure
you don't go play hero.

08:43.167 --> 08:45.135
Like you could stop me.

08:47.539 --> 08:49.139
Get down.

08:52.009 --> 08:53.309
Get down.

08:53.410 --> 08:54.811
Cat was right.

08:54.912 --> 08:56.947
You are using the necklace
to lure them out.

08:57.048 --> 08:59.916
Catherine needs to move on.

09:01.485 --> 09:02.485
NYPD!

09:03.988 --> 09:05.088
Aah!

09:07.391 --> 09:09.158
Who do you work for?!

09:09.260 --> 09:10.159
I work for no one.

09:23.741 --> 09:25.074
Why did you do that?

09:25.175 --> 09:26.976
How about a "thank you"?

09:27.077 --> 09:29.444
For what?
Screwing things up?

09:29.545 --> 09:31.814
The whole point was
to try and find out

09:31.915 --> 09:33.482
who they work for.

09:33.583 --> 09:35.463
Now they're not going
to tell me much, are they?

09:38.755 --> 09:40.355
We made it in
without incident.

09:40.456 --> 09:41.623
So just stay calm.

09:41.724 --> 09:43.458
Control yourself.

09:43.559 --> 09:45.093
- I am in control.
- Yeah, but FBI's on their way.

09:45.194 --> 09:46.928
Are you sure you
don't want to just

09:47.029 --> 09:48.530
give us the necklace,
avoid all this?

09:48.631 --> 09:51.300
I think I'd rather
talk to the FBI.

09:52.769 --> 09:54.135
Okay, so what are
you gonna say?

09:54.236 --> 09:55.370
We have to come up with
some plausible reason

09:55.471 --> 09:56.505
about how you got it.

09:56.606 --> 09:57.939
How about an auction?

09:58.040 --> 09:59.607
How about,
"My boyfriend gave it to me"?

09:59.708 --> 10:01.843
Okay, well...

10:01.944 --> 10:04.478
a jeweler is easier
to pretend-corroborate.

10:04.579 --> 10:05.880
Um...

10:05.981 --> 10:07.448
there's that CI
who's got that store

10:07.549 --> 10:09.450
in Nolita--
Elmshorn Jewelers.

10:09.551 --> 10:11.385
You can say they reached out,
loaned you the jewel

10:11.486 --> 10:13.166
for all those events
you've been attending.

10:13.222 --> 10:15.189
Those events really bother you,
don't they?

10:15.290 --> 10:16.857
You keep mentioning them.

10:16.958 --> 10:19.893
Yeah, because that's how
the FBI tracked you down.

10:19.994 --> 10:21.362
I mean, I understand.

10:21.463 --> 10:23.264
You never really did get
to go on any dates...

10:23.332 --> 10:24.565
Okay,
that's enough.

10:24.666 --> 10:26.367
I'm not sure if
you're getting this,

10:26.468 --> 10:27.835
but Catherine's
trying to help you.

10:27.936 --> 10:29.970
By coming up with
a cover story

10:30.071 --> 10:32.706
so you don't end up in jail.
Or worse, a lab.

10:32.807 --> 10:34.174
You know, like E.T. at
the end of the movie?

10:34.275 --> 10:36.210
Please, she'd love nothing more.
Okay, let's just calm...

10:36.311 --> 10:38.645
Anything to get me out of the picture.
All of us calm down.

10:38.746 --> 10:40.147
But guess what.
It won't work.

10:40.248 --> 10:43.350
The connection
that Vincent and I have is...

10:43.451 --> 10:44.517
It's primal.

10:44.618 --> 10:46.320
And it drives you

10:46.420 --> 10:48.254
crazy with jealousy.

10:48.356 --> 10:49.922
Jealousy?
I mean, it's why

10:50.023 --> 10:51.825
you brought me in here.
Okay, how many times do I have

10:51.925 --> 10:53.326
to say that I am not jealous?
Of course you're not jealous.

10:53.427 --> 10:55.562
Why would you be jealous?
Why would I be jealous? You're not.

10:55.663 --> 10:57.423
No, 'cause Vincent's been
trotting you around

10:57.498 --> 10:58.998
using you as bait with no regard
for your safety.

10:59.099 --> 10:59.999
You think those are dates?

11:00.100 --> 11:01.200
I think you're crazy.

11:01.301 --> 11:02.402
You are crazy.
Yeah.

11:02.503 --> 11:03.370
Agent Landon.

11:03.471 --> 11:04.370
Hi, we were

11:04.471 --> 11:05.371
just having a chat

11:05.472 --> 11:06.405
with, uh, Ms. Windsor here.

11:06.506 --> 11:07.406
Everything okay, Ms. Windsor?

11:07.507 --> 11:08.607
Yeah, she's great.

11:08.708 --> 11:09.909
Yeah, you know,
just some pressure.

11:10.010 --> 11:11.210
And she has
a solid explanation

11:11.311 --> 11:12.745
for why she had the jewel,

11:12.846 --> 11:14.546
so there's no reason
for you to worry about that.

11:14.647 --> 11:15.581
Take a break.

11:15.682 --> 11:17.449
I'll take over from here.

11:17.550 --> 11:21.052
Okay, um, if you need us,
we will be out there.

11:40.139 --> 11:41.806
What are you doing?

11:41.908 --> 11:42.941
I'm searching for leads.

11:43.042 --> 11:44.376
Isn't that what you're doing?

11:44.476 --> 11:46.778
So what, now we're
working together?

11:46.879 --> 11:49.114
Vincent, we all want to know
who's behind these heists.

11:49.215 --> 11:50.548
Why not help each other?

11:50.649 --> 11:53.951
Because I don't trust
any of you.

11:54.052 --> 11:55.653
I just saved your life.

11:55.754 --> 11:58.122
Yeah, and you also
tried to kill me.

11:58.223 --> 12:00.591
Looks like this one's
called Ivan.

12:00.692 --> 12:01.893
That was a long time ago.

12:01.993 --> 12:03.494
Well, not so long ago,

12:03.595 --> 12:04.929
Catherine shot me.

12:06.331 --> 12:07.998
Well, Tess never did anything.

12:08.099 --> 12:09.934
Oh, no, she shot me, too.

12:10.035 --> 12:11.969
And now you're working
with the FBI.

12:12.070 --> 12:15.239
And do I really need to explain
to you how I feel about them?

12:15.340 --> 12:18.075
Look, you want to figure
this out on your own, fine.

12:18.176 --> 12:19.743
Let me give you some advice.

12:19.844 --> 12:21.745
Let Catherine have the necklace.

12:21.846 --> 12:23.113
She has the necklace.

12:23.214 --> 12:24.114
Yeah, but you'll figure out

12:24.215 --> 12:25.316
a way to get it back.

12:25.417 --> 12:27.116
The thing is, she just found out

12:27.217 --> 12:28.952
it once belonged
to her relative.

12:29.053 --> 12:31.788
Her relative?
Yes.

12:31.889 --> 12:33.657
And now she feels
like it's hers, so...

12:33.758 --> 12:35.826
Hers? It fits
into a collar

12:35.927 --> 12:37.861
that was found
on a beast skeleton.

12:37.962 --> 12:39.295
So, unless there's something
about her DNA

12:39.396 --> 12:40.797
that I don't know about...

12:40.898 --> 12:43.199
I feel like I'm
in the middle of a divorce.

12:43.300 --> 12:44.434
And you two are fighting
over the beach house.

12:44.534 --> 12:46.802
If I was your lawyer,

12:46.903 --> 12:48.171
I'd tell you to give her
the beach house.

12:48.272 --> 12:49.339
She's so angry at you.

12:49.440 --> 12:50.673
That's why she's holding

12:50.774 --> 12:52.641
onto this investigation
so tightly.

12:52.742 --> 12:54.310
But if you give her
the necklace,

12:54.411 --> 12:55.945
she might actually move on.

12:56.046 --> 12:57.513
Move on?

12:57.614 --> 12:59.615
So, that's what this is about.

12:59.716 --> 13:01.984
You're still waiting for her.

13:02.085 --> 13:04.286
Actually, she's waiting for me.

13:08.592 --> 13:10.325
Hmm, dead Ivan's got a text.

13:10.426 --> 13:11.861
What's it say?

13:11.962 --> 13:14.363
Seems these two weren't
the only ones looking

13:14.464 --> 13:18.100
for the beach house tonight.

13:32.748 --> 13:34.549
What do you think's
going on in there?

13:34.650 --> 13:35.717
She's mauling her.

13:37.252 --> 13:38.753
I'm kidding, it's fine.

13:40.789 --> 13:42.156
Then why are you clutching
the tranq gun

13:42.257 --> 13:43.925
like it's your best friend?

13:44.026 --> 13:46.561
I'm sorry, Tess, I never
should've arrested her.

13:46.662 --> 13:48.329
Hello, ladies.

13:48.430 --> 13:49.997
Hey, hey, hey.

13:50.098 --> 13:52.599
Tess, your favorite cheesecake
in the fridge.

13:52.700 --> 13:54.101
Maggie made it last night.

13:54.202 --> 13:55.569
I know about the party, Freddy.
No.

13:55.670 --> 13:57.171
It's all right.
It's not your fault.

13:57.272 --> 13:59.173
No, it's my fault,
it's all my fault.

13:59.274 --> 14:01.509
How about a little nap
in the tank, hmm?

14:01.609 --> 14:02.576
Okeydokey.

14:02.677 --> 14:04.378
But wait.

14:04.479 --> 14:05.946
There is cheesecake,
though, right?

14:06.047 --> 14:08.248
Come on.
She's okay.

14:08.349 --> 14:11.919
See? I told you
it'd be fine.

14:12.020 --> 14:15.022
I need you to call
Elmshorn Jewelers.

14:15.122 --> 14:16.890
Already did, they corroborated.
But we still need to authenticate it.

14:16.991 --> 14:18.859
Find out how they
got a hold of it.

14:18.960 --> 14:20.920
She wouldn't give it up,
I had to send in a uni in

14:20.995 --> 14:22.662
to forcibly remove it.
You did what?

14:27.535 --> 14:29.469
I got it! I got it!

14:29.570 --> 14:31.371
Gabe.

14:31.472 --> 14:33.039
All right, get over here!
Call an ambulance.

14:33.140 --> 14:35.141
Okay, he's fine, everyone
back up, back up.

14:35.242 --> 14:36.309
You okay?
You okay?

14:36.410 --> 14:37.677
Don't touch him!
H-Hey, hey.

14:39.813 --> 14:40.947
He ripped it off my neck,
I lost control,

14:41.048 --> 14:42.147
I couldn't help it.

14:42.248 --> 14:43.248
It's gonna be okay, Tori.

14:43.316 --> 14:45.585
Just stay calm, all right?

14:45.686 --> 14:47.053
Paramedics are on their way.

14:47.153 --> 14:48.921
I'm gonna call for backup.

14:49.022 --> 14:50.489
I'm sorry, who are you?

14:50.591 --> 14:53.325
Is that the evidence?
I'm with the 95th.

14:53.426 --> 14:54.660
No, no, hey, wait,
I worked the 95th.

14:54.761 --> 14:56.228
I don't know you.
Is that evidence? I got that.

14:56.329 --> 14:58.763
I'm with
the evidence department.

14:58.864 --> 15:01.100
It's okay, I'll take it.

15:01.201 --> 15:04.103
What's going on here?
I got it from here.

15:04.204 --> 15:06.605
Yeah, we got an emergency
situation at the 125th...

15:06.706 --> 15:08.240
Everyone down or she's dead!

15:09.609 --> 15:12.077
Get down!
Okay.

15:12.177 --> 15:14.345
Hey, all right, all right.
Now, everyone on the floor.

15:14.446 --> 15:16.347
Don't worry.

15:16.448 --> 15:17.782
It's just a tranq.

15:17.883 --> 15:19.163
Everyone down
or she's dead!

15:19.251 --> 15:20.451
Okay, take it easy,
take it easy.

15:20.552 --> 15:21.720
Omar, get the girl...

15:23.555 --> 15:27.258
Everyone on the floor!

15:27.359 --> 15:29.293
Your guy beat her up.
Put down the gun.

15:29.394 --> 15:32.396
It's not a...
Put it down!

15:37.102 --> 15:38.469
Everything's fine, huh?

15:43.208 --> 15:44.675
We got to get out of here.

15:44.776 --> 15:46.010
No, no, no.
Wait, wait, wait.

15:46.111 --> 15:47.978
Wait, no, I mean,

15:48.079 --> 15:49.146
please let her go.

15:49.247 --> 15:50.368
Uh, it's her birthday for...

15:55.319 --> 15:59.023
Anybody else want to be a hero?

16:18.620 --> 16:20.654
Let's go, let's go,
move, move, move.

16:23.958 --> 16:25.892
Keep moving,
keep moving...

16:31.165 --> 16:33.200
Get behind the
tape, move it.

16:33.301 --> 16:35.703
ADA Lowan,
interim chief of precinct.

16:35.804 --> 16:36.737
What do we got?

16:36.838 --> 16:37.904
Locals heard shots fired.

16:38.005 --> 16:38.972
By the time we got here,

16:39.073 --> 16:40.207
the place was barricaded.

16:40.308 --> 16:41.674
Anything on who's in there?

16:41.775 --> 16:43.255
Haven't established
communication yet.

16:43.311 --> 16:45.712
Don't know who they are
or what they want.

16:48.282 --> 16:49.716
Guns and cell phones.

16:49.817 --> 16:52.185
Let's go.

16:52.286 --> 16:54.054
Cuff her, too.

17:01.294 --> 17:02.428
So, let's go.

17:02.529 --> 17:05.130
I-I-I got chewing gum.

17:06.867 --> 17:08.534
It's a war zone out there.

17:08.635 --> 17:10.603
What's the plan?

17:10.704 --> 17:12.037
A helicopter.

17:12.137 --> 17:13.771
Or we shoot one of them

17:13.874 --> 17:16.909
every 30 minutes.

17:17.010 --> 17:19.511
Take a picture
of the dead guy

17:19.612 --> 17:20.933
to let them know
we mean business.

17:23.282 --> 17:25.184
What about her?
I think she's still alive.

17:25.285 --> 17:26.218
What did you do to her?

17:26.319 --> 17:27.786
Me?

17:27.887 --> 17:29.354
You beat the crap out of her.

17:29.455 --> 17:32.424
She attacked me!

17:32.525 --> 17:33.892
Throw her in a cell

17:33.993 --> 17:35.894
and just shut up,
I got to think.

17:40.733 --> 17:42.801
Any ideas?

17:42.902 --> 17:45.236
No, but we've seen their faces.

17:45.337 --> 17:46.938
It's not good.

17:47.039 --> 17:48.806
Tori.
Hey!

17:48.908 --> 17:50.641
Shut up!

17:50.742 --> 17:52.143
I'm sorry, I just...

17:52.244 --> 17:53.378
I don't think she
should be left alone.

17:53.478 --> 17:54.712
She seems really hurt.

17:54.813 --> 17:56.281
If she dies...

17:56.382 --> 17:58.549
I know you guys are gonna
use us as leverage,

17:58.650 --> 18:00.251
And pretty rich girl?

18:00.352 --> 18:02.193
They're gonna care a lot more
about her than...

18:09.494 --> 18:11.261
I'll make sure
she's all right.

18:14.265 --> 18:15.766
Tori?

18:15.867 --> 18:18.168
Tori, hey, wake up.

18:18.269 --> 18:19.769
Tori!

18:19.870 --> 18:23.606
Wake up.

18:23.707 --> 18:25.309
The longer a hostage
situation takes,

18:25.410 --> 18:26.944
the more likely that
it'll end peacefully.

18:27.045 --> 18:29.446
Give the hostage-takers
more time to bond.

18:29.547 --> 18:30.647
Captain Bennett?

18:30.748 --> 18:31.915
We have them
on the phone now.

18:32.016 --> 18:33.250
Oh, good.

18:33.351 --> 18:34.418
Bennett here.

18:34.518 --> 18:36.453
Uh-huh.

18:38.522 --> 18:40.490
What are you doing?

18:40.591 --> 18:41.624
Just having a lookey-loo.

18:41.725 --> 18:42.992
A lookey-loo at blueprints?

18:43.093 --> 18:44.093
Mm-hmm.

18:44.194 --> 18:45.495
If you are planning on going in,

18:45.596 --> 18:46.596
we need to work together.

18:46.597 --> 18:48.431
Not happening.

18:48.532 --> 18:49.933
There can't be any surprises.

18:50.033 --> 18:51.667
They have
already killed someone.

18:51.768 --> 18:52.868
Your mess.

18:52.970 --> 18:53.970
So, you're just going in

18:54.071 --> 18:54.971
for the necklace?

18:55.072 --> 18:56.472
Yeah.

18:56.573 --> 18:59.275
Catherine was right--
you really are unrecognizable.

18:59.376 --> 19:01.677
Is she in there?

19:01.778 --> 19:03.446
Yeah.

19:03.546 --> 19:05.481
And Tori, and we're
not really sure what...

19:08.417 --> 19:11.487
Okay, so the plan is
for you to do what you do,

19:11.588 --> 19:13.555
break our cuffs,
but do it quietly,

19:13.656 --> 19:15.457
because there is
a guy out there guarding us.

19:15.558 --> 19:17.893
Wait, did anyone see me?
No.

19:17.994 --> 19:19.674
No, lucky for you,
they were all distracted

19:19.762 --> 19:21.296
by the guys with guns.

19:21.397 --> 19:22.364
There are
six of them out there.

19:22.465 --> 19:23.699
I figure
if we can take down

19:23.800 --> 19:25.233
even two of them,
get their weapons,

19:25.334 --> 19:26.734
we can get control
of the precinct.

19:26.835 --> 19:28.136
Wait.

19:28.237 --> 19:29.737
Who has the necklace?

19:29.838 --> 19:32.007
The head guy, Vlad.

19:32.108 --> 19:35.010
And I'm sorry.

19:35.111 --> 19:37.645
We never should've
taken it from you.

19:37.746 --> 19:39.047
And I'm sorry
about what I said.

19:39.148 --> 19:41.215
And you're right,
you know, I-I am jealous

19:41.316 --> 19:43.718
of you and Vincent,
and you have a connection...

19:43.819 --> 19:46.020
Would you just shut up?

19:46.121 --> 19:49.256
Oh, oh, you're doing it now?

19:49.357 --> 19:52.527
Okay, um, I hate you.

19:52.628 --> 19:55.029
And, uh, you and Vincent
don't stand a chance.

20:02.837 --> 20:05.205
Awesome, awesome.
Okay, mine.

20:05.306 --> 20:07.207
Tori.

20:13.281 --> 20:14.548
Tori!

20:23.958 --> 20:26.893
I'm calm, you're the one
who should be worried.

20:26.994 --> 20:29.295
You have 20 more minutes
to get it here,

20:29.396 --> 20:30.729
or I kill one of them!

20:44.878 --> 20:46.112
All this for a necklace?

20:46.213 --> 20:47.746
It must be some clue.

20:47.847 --> 20:49.582
That's what you're thinking
about right now?

20:49.683 --> 20:51.383
Yeah, and how Tori Windsor
tossed that guy

20:51.484 --> 20:53.285
like a softball, it's crazy.

20:57.857 --> 20:58.991
What?

20:59.092 --> 21:01.093
Nothing.

21:01.194 --> 21:02.795
Can we not talk
about this right now?

21:02.896 --> 21:04.896
You think maybe
we could call 'em back,

21:04.997 --> 21:07.065
order a pizza or something?
I'm starving.

21:07.165 --> 21:09.100
So find
something.

21:10.235 --> 21:12.503
Tess, so you do
know something.

21:12.605 --> 21:14.005
Yeah, I know
that one of us

21:14.106 --> 21:15.607
will be dead
in 15 minutes.

21:15.708 --> 21:18.542
Is that why Cat got herself
locked in that cell with her?

21:26.351 --> 21:27.818
There's cheesecake
in the fridge...

21:27.919 --> 21:28.619
Shut up!

21:50.975 --> 21:52.909
It's Ivan.

21:54.311 --> 21:55.612
You still on the boat?

21:55.713 --> 21:57.113
No.

21:57.214 --> 21:58.881
Necklace wasn't there.
You have it?

21:58.982 --> 21:59.815
Yeah.

21:59.916 --> 22:02.185
On you?

22:02.286 --> 22:03.553
What, you need a picture?

22:03.654 --> 22:04.554
Look, we got a situation here.

22:04.655 --> 22:06.389
I'm in the basement.

22:06.490 --> 22:07.657
You're here?

22:07.758 --> 22:08.891
How did you get in?

22:08.992 --> 22:10.126
Look, just come down here,

22:10.227 --> 22:12.562
I show you way out, okay?

22:35.685 --> 22:36.885
Ivan?

22:53.169 --> 22:55.203
Gabe, it's me.

22:55.304 --> 22:56.237
Cat, are you all right?

22:56.338 --> 22:57.438
Yeah.

22:57.539 --> 22:59.040
Now, don't be a hero.

22:59.141 --> 23:00.301
We are taking care of things.

23:00.375 --> 23:01.710
Just stay under the radar.

23:01.811 --> 23:03.277
It's a little late for that.
Tori killed the guy

23:03.378 --> 23:05.613
who was guarding our cell.
She's on the hunt

23:05.714 --> 23:07.848
for the necklace. I've got to find her.
All right.

23:07.949 --> 23:09.116
Okay, but what if she beasts out
and panics them

23:09.218 --> 23:10.384
and they start
shooting hostages?

23:10.485 --> 23:11.852
I think Vincent

23:11.953 --> 23:13.621
is in there looking
for the necklace, too.

23:13.722 --> 23:15.256
He is unbelievable.

23:15.357 --> 23:17.024
But maybe you can
persuade him to help.

23:17.125 --> 23:18.693
I know it doesn't seem like it,

23:18.793 --> 23:20.694
but he still cares about you.

23:20.795 --> 23:22.295
When he heard
what was happening,

23:22.396 --> 23:24.698
the first person
he asked about was you.

23:24.799 --> 23:26.600
He's the one who's unresolved.

23:26.701 --> 23:28.102
Okay, then why isn't he here?

23:28.203 --> 23:30.270
If he can sense me,
if he can hear me...

23:30.371 --> 23:31.571
Then try talking to him.

23:31.672 --> 23:33.306
Convince him
that he can trust you.

23:33.407 --> 23:35.375
Because if you're right,
and Tori sets these guys off,

23:35.476 --> 23:37.210
you are gonna need his help.

23:37.311 --> 23:39.579
Okay.
I'll try.

23:39.680 --> 23:42.215
And when this is over...

23:42.316 --> 23:44.317
I'm in.

23:44.418 --> 23:45.918
I want to be with you.

23:50.658 --> 23:52.825
I gotta go.

23:55.595 --> 23:57.930
Ivan.

24:00.234 --> 24:01.768
Ivan?

24:22.088 --> 24:24.089
Vincent?
You can have the necklace.

24:24.190 --> 24:25.924
I already got it.
Okay, I need your help.

24:26.025 --> 24:27.159
I'm out of here.
There are innocent people...

24:27.260 --> 24:29.294
Move!

24:40.306 --> 24:41.472
I wasn't trying
to hurt her.

24:41.573 --> 24:44.275
I wanted to work
together, but...

24:44.376 --> 24:45.976
I know it doesn't look
like it, it's just...

24:46.077 --> 24:47.779
You knocked out a beast?

24:47.879 --> 24:49.980
How did you do that?

24:50.081 --> 24:52.417
I don't know.

24:56.205 --> 24:57.839
Maybe it was because
she was tranqed.

24:57.940 --> 24:59.240
I had to,

24:59.341 --> 25:00.909
they were gonna shoot her.

25:02.011 --> 25:03.277
Her pulse is strong.

25:03.379 --> 25:05.113
That's good.

25:05.214 --> 25:07.015
You know, there is
a room full of people

25:07.116 --> 25:08.582
whose pulses are probably
sky-high with fear

25:08.683 --> 25:09.850
right now.

25:09.951 --> 25:11.552
And whose fault is that?

25:11.653 --> 25:12.953
Vincent, we could save them.

25:13.055 --> 25:14.855
There are only four
hostage-takers left,

25:14.956 --> 25:17.392
and we have dealt with
much worse odds before.

25:17.493 --> 25:18.926
I could turn out the lights,

25:19.028 --> 25:20.361
make sure that nobody sees you.

25:20.462 --> 25:21.896
Okay, could you stop fidgeting

25:21.997 --> 25:23.130
with that stupid necklace?

25:23.231 --> 25:24.398
Stupid?

25:24.499 --> 25:25.766
Yes. What's
happened to you?

25:25.867 --> 25:27.968
You used to be all about
saving people's lives,

25:28.069 --> 25:29.430
and now you're...
And now I'm what?

25:29.504 --> 25:31.539
I'm not willing
to jump into some room

25:31.640 --> 25:34.241
and expose what I really am
in front of all those people?

25:34.342 --> 25:35.976
Like I'm some lab rat?

25:36.077 --> 25:37.611
The old Vincent
wouldn't

25:37.712 --> 25:39.446
have been worried
about exposure.

25:39.547 --> 25:41.481
And I told you,
we would protect you

25:41.582 --> 25:43.383
just like we
always have.

25:43.484 --> 25:44.884
Oh, except for a few hours ago,

25:44.985 --> 25:46.619
when you stormed onto my boat,
arrested Tori,

25:46.720 --> 25:48.621
risking exposing the both of us,

25:48.722 --> 25:51.758
all because you wanted
that "stupid" necklace.

25:51.859 --> 25:54.827
You know what?
I heard about your ancestor.

25:54.929 --> 25:56.449
You think you're gonna
make some claim?

25:56.496 --> 25:58.230
No, I think I have
a part in all this,

25:58.331 --> 26:00.800
but I'm not going to choose that
over saving innocent lives.

26:00.901 --> 26:02.068
Look at you,

26:02.169 --> 26:03.302
you're still
investigating.

26:03.403 --> 26:04.571
Yeah, he was
the head guy, right?

26:04.672 --> 26:07.006
He probably talks to the boss.

26:07.107 --> 26:09.108
And your place in all this?

26:09.209 --> 26:11.477
Your mother,
she corrupted my DNA.

26:11.578 --> 26:14.113
Your father, he wiped my memory,
then tried to obliterate me.

26:14.214 --> 26:16.148
Now there's some woman
in the 1800s

26:16.249 --> 26:18.350
who had this jewel
that fits into a beast leash?

26:18.452 --> 26:20.752
What?
Yeah, 'cause that's what

26:20.853 --> 26:22.588
the stupid necklace
really is, right?

26:22.689 --> 26:25.357
Your ancestor was kicking around
somebody whose DNA

26:25.459 --> 26:27.493
looked a lot
like mine.

26:27.594 --> 26:29.695
I guess it runs
in your family.

26:29.796 --> 26:31.362
I don't know...
You know what?

26:31.464 --> 26:33.665
You want to know
what happened to the old Vincent?

26:33.766 --> 26:36.267
He was deceived and hurt

26:36.368 --> 26:38.136
by almost everyone
in your family tree.

26:38.237 --> 26:40.305
So excuse me if
I'd rather stop

26:40.406 --> 26:41.339
whoever's trying
to kill us next

26:41.440 --> 26:42.808
than help you be
some hero today.

26:42.909 --> 26:44.875
Okay, so whoever's
after this jewel,

26:44.977 --> 26:46.677
they're-they're trying
to control beasts?

26:46.778 --> 26:48.613
Yeah.

26:48.714 --> 26:50.548
Doesn't sound so
stupid now, does it?

26:50.649 --> 26:53.518
It is if innocent lives
are at risk.

26:55.754 --> 26:57.155
Come on, let's go.

27:11.837 --> 27:14.304
Yeah, I have the necklace.

27:14.405 --> 27:15.840
Bowery and Houston,

27:15.941 --> 27:17.108
I meet you there.

27:19.110 --> 27:21.578
Where the hell's
the helicopter?

27:21.679 --> 27:23.380
Nico, why don't
you stop

27:23.481 --> 27:24.881
stuffing
your face?

27:24.982 --> 27:26.683
Find Vlad,
see what's going on.

27:26.784 --> 27:29.620
Petra, go check on the girls.

27:31.122 --> 27:32.889
That was my birthday cake.

27:32.990 --> 27:36.159
You really like
your birthday.

27:36.260 --> 27:37.694
My friend's
wife made it.

27:37.795 --> 27:40.764
Just saying that most
people above the age of 12

27:40.865 --> 27:43.199
generally don't love
their birthdays.

27:43.300 --> 27:45.635
Unless they feel their
life is never about them.

27:48.706 --> 27:49.873
Are you profiling me?

27:49.974 --> 27:51.740
I mean,
it makes sense.

27:51.841 --> 27:53.909
Someone who's
covering something--

27:54.010 --> 27:55.444
their whole life
becomes about that

27:55.546 --> 27:57.078
and not about them.

28:00.216 --> 28:01.783
I can't believe him.

28:01.884 --> 28:03.284
We're about to die,
and I still have

28:03.319 --> 28:04.686
to cover all this.
You know what?

28:04.787 --> 28:06.621
Whatever it is you think
I'm covering, yes.

28:06.722 --> 28:08.923
Okay? Yes.

28:11.194 --> 28:12.794
Matteo's dead.
What?

28:12.895 --> 28:14.028
And those bitches,

28:14.129 --> 28:15.963
they're not
in their cell.

28:25.040 --> 28:26.708
Vlad's dead.

28:26.809 --> 28:28.943
Where's the necklace?
It's gone!

28:29.044 --> 28:30.511
We gotta find 'em.

28:33.315 --> 28:34.648
Gabe, you gotta get here quick.

28:34.749 --> 28:36.217
Everything's falling apart.

28:36.318 --> 28:37.784
Vincent's isn't gonna show,
so hurry.

28:37.885 --> 28:39.886
Who in the hell
killed two of our men?

28:39.987 --> 28:41.455
And where are those girls?

28:41.556 --> 28:43.757
She's... she's her partner,
I saw a picture in her desk.

28:45.159 --> 28:45.992
No, no, no.
Get up!

28:46.094 --> 28:47.327
No, no, no.

28:47.428 --> 28:49.462
Get up!

28:51.766 --> 28:53.233
Girls!

28:53.334 --> 28:55.135
You got 20 seconds
to come out here

28:55.236 --> 28:57.570
with the necklace.

28:57.671 --> 28:59.339
Otherwise,
cop lady,

28:59.440 --> 29:00.941
say good-bye
to your partner.

29:02.843 --> 29:04.644
Vincent, I know you can hear me.

29:06.347 --> 29:07.780
15 seconds!

29:07.881 --> 29:09.582
Vincent, I'm sorry, I...

29:09.683 --> 29:11.351
I didn't realize
that it was a leash.

29:11.452 --> 29:14.186
I can't imagine
how that would feel.

29:14.288 --> 29:15.521
I know that you've been hurt.

29:15.623 --> 29:17.257
By everyone, including me.

29:17.358 --> 29:18.491
I was just...

29:18.592 --> 29:21.193
I was so blinded by my anger,

29:21.294 --> 29:23.662
I forgot that
you weren't the enemy.

29:27.100 --> 29:30.369
I know, I know
the old Vincent is in there.

29:30.470 --> 29:31.804
Please.

29:31.905 --> 29:33.172
Just, please, come out.

29:33.273 --> 29:35.707
We will-- I will--
I will protect you.

29:35.808 --> 29:37.709
I promise.

29:37.810 --> 29:39.378
Ten seconds,
girls!

29:39.479 --> 29:40.979
Ten!

29:41.080 --> 29:42.881
Nine!
Eight.

29:42.982 --> 29:44.549
Seven.
Six.

29:44.651 --> 29:45.651
Five.

29:45.752 --> 29:46.851
Four.

29:46.952 --> 29:48.720
Three.
Two.

29:48.821 --> 29:50.989
Wait!

30:01.233 --> 30:04.202
The war hero.

30:04.303 --> 30:06.337
You didn't get enough
gunfire overseas?

30:08.140 --> 30:09.307
I have the necklace.

30:09.408 --> 30:10.841
Let her go.

30:21.612 --> 30:24.247
So, where is it?

30:24.730 --> 30:26.631
The necklace is
somewhere safe.

30:27.697 --> 30:29.300
Come on, I figured
I walked in here with it,

30:29.301 --> 30:31.202
you guys would
shoot me, right?

30:31.303 --> 30:33.037
This way, you gotta
keep me alive

30:33.138 --> 30:34.671
so I can tell you
where it is.

30:34.773 --> 30:36.373
Just let her go,
and I'll show you.

30:36.474 --> 30:38.074
You took out
two of our guys.

30:38.175 --> 30:39.476
Why should
I believe you?

30:39.577 --> 30:42.078
Especially since
your bitch girlfriend

30:42.179 --> 30:43.414
started this whole thing.
No, no, no.

30:43.515 --> 30:45.482
She's got nothing
to do with it.

30:45.583 --> 30:47.017
Okay, and up until now you guys
have kept things under control.

30:47.118 --> 30:48.652
Everyone out there
knows that...

30:48.753 --> 30:49.887
Then where's the helicopter?

30:49.987 --> 30:51.388
It's on its way.

30:51.488 --> 30:53.856
Okay? But you hurt
anyone else,

30:53.958 --> 30:56.092
and they will storm this place.
And let's be honest,

30:56.193 --> 30:58.328
it's not just a helicopter
you want, right?

30:58.429 --> 30:59.930
So make it easy.

31:00.031 --> 31:02.498
Let everyone go,
and I will give you

31:02.599 --> 31:04.500
what you are
really here for.

31:04.601 --> 31:06.937
Sure.

31:07.038 --> 31:08.704
You want us to give you
our guns, too?

31:08.806 --> 31:10.072
Search this guy.

31:10.173 --> 31:12.575
Gabe, where's
the circuit breaker?

31:12.676 --> 31:13.576
What?

31:13.677 --> 31:15.210
I need to turn the lights off.

31:15.312 --> 31:17.279
Vincent gave himself up,
he's-he's in there.

31:17.380 --> 31:18.714
Look, ESU's on the way.

31:18.816 --> 31:20.450
Does anyone know
where the circuit breakers are?

31:20.551 --> 31:22.718
ESU? No. No,
you cannot let them up here.

31:22.820 --> 31:24.553
He's gonna lose control,

31:24.654 --> 31:26.688
and I told him that we would
protect him.

31:26.789 --> 31:30.059
Look, I am just trying
to work it out so everyone

31:30.160 --> 31:32.294
gets what they want,
but I'm warning you,

31:32.395 --> 31:34.763
I'm getting a little angry.
You don't want that.

31:34.864 --> 31:36.365
Just shut up!
It's okay, Tess.

31:36.466 --> 31:37.967
I don't know,
the redhead said

31:38.068 --> 31:39.634
she was gonna get angry
right before the...

31:39.735 --> 31:41.970
Nico, search him.

31:55.351 --> 31:56.718
Okay, I got it.

31:56.819 --> 31:58.819
Bingo.

31:58.920 --> 32:00.121
What the...?

32:06.728 --> 32:09.130
Move! Let's go!

32:25.547 --> 32:26.747
Vincent!

32:26.848 --> 32:28.949
Vincent, where are you?!

32:29.050 --> 32:31.118
I can't! I...

32:46.267 --> 32:50.469
You really should have
just given me the necklace!

32:53.574 --> 32:55.474
Vincent!

32:55.576 --> 32:57.143
The necklace!

32:57.244 --> 32:59.012
Get rid of the necklace!

32:59.112 --> 33:02.214
Just slide it down.

33:23.302 --> 33:24.803
What are you?

33:24.904 --> 33:25.904
Who do you work for?

33:26.005 --> 33:27.639
You heard her.

33:27.740 --> 33:30.642
Tell us who you're working for,
and I will let you live.

33:30.743 --> 33:33.579
Let me live? You don't know
who we're dealing with.

33:33.680 --> 33:35.480
I'm already dead.

33:55.266 --> 33:56.667
You turned the lights off.

33:56.768 --> 33:59.036
You didn't leave.

34:01.873 --> 34:03.674
Police! Don't move!

34:07.646 --> 34:10.114
Everybody stay down!

34:19.389 --> 34:21.291
So, what happened next?

34:21.391 --> 34:22.958
So, I went to the bullpen,
and that's where I saw

34:23.060 --> 34:24.594
Specialist Keller.
Lucky for us,

34:24.695 --> 34:26.630
you were able to get in
through an air duct.

34:26.730 --> 34:28.297
I know you saw
a lot worse in combat,

34:28.399 --> 34:30.699
but what you did
here tonight...

34:30.801 --> 34:32.369
Well, it was
a-a team effort, sir.

34:32.469 --> 34:34.070
Actually, he really
was the hero.

34:34.172 --> 34:36.105
I mean, we were all heroes,
but...

34:36.206 --> 34:38.074
You managed to do it
in handcuffs.

34:38.175 --> 34:39.308
- Yeah.
- Excuse me,

34:39.409 --> 34:41.077
I gotta check in with ESU.
Awesome.

34:43.746 --> 34:46.149
That feels really good.

34:46.248 --> 34:48.717
You're finally free.

34:48.819 --> 34:52.221
♪ And so you built...

34:52.322 --> 34:56.592
Uh, well, I'm gonna go
and try to find Tori.

34:56.693 --> 34:57.959
Okay.

34:58.061 --> 34:59.928
♪ Though it starts...

35:00.029 --> 35:01.797
Thank God for Vincent.

35:01.898 --> 35:04.400
You're the one wanted
to try and work with him.

35:04.501 --> 35:07.636
I know you think
he still has feelings for me,

35:07.737 --> 35:09.404
but I think
he actually wanted

35:09.505 --> 35:11.272
to save everyone,
Tess, and...

35:11.373 --> 35:13.308
Cat, it's all right
if he's unresolved.

35:13.409 --> 35:16.011
I get why he would be.

35:16.112 --> 35:20.916
You're right,
I <i>was</i> unresolved.

35:21.017 --> 35:22.537
And not because
I was angry at Vincent,

35:22.551 --> 35:24.853
but because I was angry
at myself.

35:24.954 --> 35:26.987
I'm supposed to be this strong,
independent woman

35:27.089 --> 35:28.122
who makes good judgments.

35:28.224 --> 35:30.491
How could I fall in love
with someone like that?

35:30.593 --> 35:31.959
What does that say
about me?

35:32.060 --> 35:33.361
He was different then.

35:33.462 --> 35:36.130
Yeah. Yeah, that's what
I realized tonight.

35:36.232 --> 35:40.335
I didn't fall in love
with an ass.

35:40.436 --> 35:42.469
I'm not that screwed up.

35:42.570 --> 35:44.271
I could have told you that.

35:44.372 --> 35:46.540
Yeah, you could have.

35:46.641 --> 35:50.711
You knew I was unresolved,
I had absolutely no clue.

35:50.812 --> 35:55.883
That's funny, 'cause right now
I feel pretty darn clueless.

35:55.984 --> 35:57.718
I'm sorry.

35:57.819 --> 36:00.887
I, uh, I don't know.

36:00.988 --> 36:04.625
I just-- I haven't,
I haven't been on my own in,

36:04.726 --> 36:08.161
I don't even know how long
it's been.

36:08.263 --> 36:11.798
Which is probably why you knew
me better than I knew myself.

36:11.899 --> 36:15.135
You're not ready.

36:15.236 --> 36:18.638
I care about you too much
to screw it up.

36:18.739 --> 36:22.242
I mean, you got Tess a banner.

36:26.280 --> 36:27.847
Oh, no, the party!

36:27.948 --> 36:32.184
My doorman said that about
a hundred people came.

36:32.286 --> 36:34.987
Apparently they left us
some booze.

36:35.088 --> 36:37.923
After tonight I
could use some.

36:38.024 --> 36:40.092
Why?
Because of our conversation?

36:40.193 --> 36:45.030
No. Because you and 12 other
people almost died.

36:45.131 --> 36:47.433
And we lost Freddy.

36:47.534 --> 36:48.901
As far as

36:49.002 --> 36:51.503
our conversation goes,
I said I'm in.

36:51.604 --> 36:53.405
That doesn't change.

36:53.506 --> 36:55.808
You're worth
waiting for.

36:56.976 --> 37:00.179
Especially once you really know
yourself.

37:00.280 --> 37:04.949
I left my stuff inside. Um,
I'll meet you in the bullpen.

37:05.050 --> 37:06.718
Crime scene.

37:22.234 --> 37:25.102
You know, I can toss a guy
across a room.

37:25.204 --> 37:26.370
So can Cat.

37:26.471 --> 37:29.373
Oh, we're back to covering now?

37:29.474 --> 37:31.775
I'm just saying that just
because someone's small,

37:31.877 --> 37:33.911
doesn't mean they're not capable
of doing crazy things.

37:34.012 --> 37:35.313
And what about
Vincent Keller?

37:35.413 --> 37:37.648
He took out four gunmen
without a weapon?

37:37.749 --> 37:39.216
You read the byline
on that photo.

37:39.317 --> 37:40.784
Guy's a war hero.

37:40.885 --> 37:43.920
Detective Vargas,
are you recanting?

37:44.021 --> 37:46.289
After what we've been through,
call me Tess.

37:46.391 --> 37:50.661
You said that what I thought you
were covering up is true, so...

37:50.762 --> 37:53.129
So you're a profiler.

37:53.231 --> 37:55.565
You know when you go through
something like this,

37:55.666 --> 37:57.968
a life-and-death experience,
you-you realize

37:58.069 --> 37:59.736
you didn't appreciate
what you have.

37:59.837 --> 38:02.072
I think I'm having one
of those moments.

38:02.173 --> 38:04.140
And what <i>do</i> you have?

38:04.242 --> 38:07.577
More friends than I realized.

38:07.678 --> 38:09.779
That's a pretty good birthday
present, right?

38:09.881 --> 38:11.581
Tess, they need
your statement.

38:11.682 --> 38:15.251
And by the way, I know plenty
of people over the age of 12

38:15.352 --> 38:17.820
who like their birthdays.

38:30.867 --> 38:33.302
Is Tori hiding under there?

38:33.403 --> 38:36.838
No, but after what she went
through tonight,

38:36.940 --> 38:38.207
could you blame her?

38:38.308 --> 38:40.109
Did you find her?

38:40.210 --> 38:41.710
Yeah. She's okay.

38:41.811 --> 38:43.845
Paramedics are
looking after her.

38:43.946 --> 38:46.448
What I can't find is
that damn necklace.

38:46.549 --> 38:48.216
Uh, maybe one
of the unis has it?

38:48.317 --> 38:49.284
No. I asked.

38:49.385 --> 38:51.286
No one has seen it anywhere.

38:51.387 --> 38:53.154
Do you think that whoever it was

38:53.255 --> 38:56.825
that shot that last guy
could've...?

38:56.926 --> 38:59.027
What, magically taken it
through the window?

38:59.128 --> 39:01.662
No, but I don't think
that was an NYPD sniper.

39:01.763 --> 39:04.632
I mean, we were right there.
They could've killed us.

39:04.733 --> 39:06.200
And the timing of it...

39:06.302 --> 39:08.903
Right, we were just so close
to getting information.

39:09.004 --> 39:11.205
I'm sorry
that you didn't get it.

39:11.307 --> 39:14.375
I know that I apologized
already,

39:14.476 --> 39:17.177
but I didn't know how personal
this was for you;

39:17.278 --> 39:19.379
what that gem does.

39:19.481 --> 39:21.849
Well, you felt tied to it
because of your,

39:21.950 --> 39:23.517
your family,
right?

39:23.618 --> 39:25.719
Yes.

39:25.821 --> 39:27.755
But a 200-year-old relative

39:27.856 --> 39:30.858
versus something that has
present-day power over you--

39:30.959 --> 39:33.026
I think that you win.

39:33.127 --> 39:35.162
You know what, tell me this:

39:35.263 --> 39:38.198
why would someone want
a gem that controls beasts

39:38.299 --> 39:40.934
unless they already have,
or they're creating,

39:41.035 --> 39:43.403
ones exactly like Tori and me?

39:43.504 --> 39:45.105
You have to get it back.

39:45.206 --> 39:47.274
No. <i>We</i> do.

39:47.375 --> 39:49.776
We got to stop competing.

39:50.878 --> 39:53.112
You want to work together?

39:53.213 --> 39:55.715
I think maybe we're meant to.

39:55.816 --> 39:57.851
Although, wait.

39:57.952 --> 40:00.219
Did you apologize to me?

40:00.320 --> 40:02.221
Yes. I did.

40:02.322 --> 40:04.524
Before you turned yourself over
to the hostage-taker.

40:04.625 --> 40:07.026
I was, like...
I was, like, praying to you.

40:07.127 --> 40:10.762
But... well...
I didn't hear anything.

40:10.864 --> 40:13.132
The necklace.

40:13.233 --> 40:14.967
You had it on you.

40:15.068 --> 40:16.102
So...

40:16.203 --> 40:19.238
you just showed up, without...

40:19.339 --> 40:21.773
Without hearing you
"like, praying" to me?

40:21.875 --> 40:23.108
Yeah.

40:23.209 --> 40:25.110
You shamed me
into it

40:25.211 --> 40:26.945
with your "Old Vincent" tirade.
Okay,

40:27.046 --> 40:28.580
it was not a tirade.

40:30.049 --> 40:31.483
Oh, my God!

40:35.187 --> 40:37.823
You're the
reason I'm 30.

40:37.924 --> 40:40.625
Well, they're, uh,
they're better than your 20s.

40:40.726 --> 40:43.161
At least for most people, huh?

40:45.097 --> 40:47.265
You ready to go?
Yeah.

40:47.366 --> 40:48.833
Do you want to come?

40:48.934 --> 40:50.902
We're just gonna
celebrate my birthday,

40:51.003 --> 40:52.670
survival, new friends.

40:54.540 --> 40:57.374
Well, I would love to, but...

40:59.110 --> 41:00.778
...I should probably
go get Tori home.

41:00.879 --> 41:02.012
You should come.

41:02.112 --> 41:03.146
Yeah.

41:03.247 --> 41:04.681
I... I can't.

41:04.782 --> 41:07.250
Uh, can you let know
if that necklace shows up?

41:07.351 --> 41:08.418
Okay.

41:08.519 --> 41:10.420
All right.
Happy birthday, Tess.

41:10.521 --> 41:11.688
Thanks.

41:13.424 --> 41:15.759
Oh, I hope
you don't mind,
