WEBVTT

00:13.580 --> 00:14.212
>> MAC: Oh, man, this is so

00:14.215 --> 00:15.381
exciting.

00:15.383 --> 00:16.281
>> CHARLIE: Is this the green

00:16.283 --> 00:16.882
room?

00:16.884 --> 00:17.516
>> FRANK: Yeah.

00:17.518 --> 00:18.234
>> A game show.

00:18.235 --> 00:18.951
Can you guys believe we're gonna

00:18.953 --> 00:19.652
be on a game show?

00:19.653 --> 00:20.352
>> DENNIS: All right, all right,

00:20.354 --> 00:21.020
relax.

00:21.022 --> 00:21.653
>> Awesome!

00:21.655 --> 00:22.788
Guys, the green room of

00:22.790 --> 00:23.555
<i> Family Fight...</i>

00:23.557 --> 00:24.323
I've got goose bumps.

00:24.325 --> 00:25.224
>> Yeah, all right, calm down.

00:25.226 --> 00:25.958
Don't start acting like an

00:25.960 --> 00:26.625
animal, here.

00:26.627 --> 00:27.726
All right, listen, this is

00:27.728 --> 00:28.560
<i> Family Fight.</i>

00:28.562 --> 00:29.962
This is a nationally televised

00:29.964 --> 00:30.896
program.

00:30.898 --> 00:31.897
This is a very big deal

00:31.899 --> 00:32.865
for us, okay?

00:32.867 --> 00:33.799
We're talking...

00:33.801 --> 00:34.466
What are you doing?

00:34.468 --> 00:35.134
Are you stealing an ashtray

00:35.136 --> 00:35.834
right now?

00:35.836 --> 00:36.702
>> Yeah.

00:36.704 --> 00:37.453
>> Why?

00:37.454 --> 00:38.203
We have ashtrays, and you don't

00:38.205 --> 00:38.971
even smoke.

00:38.973 --> 00:39.905
>> This is a perfect place for

00:39.907 --> 00:41.206
me to lay out my political

00:41.208 --> 00:42.207
agenda.

00:42.209 --> 00:43.842
>> No, no, no. No politics, man.

00:43.844 --> 00:44.693
>> What?

00:44.694 --> 00:45.543
>> Because it's too polarizing,

00:45.546 --> 00:46.545
okay?

00:46.547 --> 00:47.579
And don't be misogynistic and

00:47.581 --> 00:48.580
please don't be gross, I mean...

00:48.582 --> 00:49.581
Guys, let's-let's be smart

00:49.583 --> 00:50.582
about this.

00:50.584 --> 00:51.650
Let's be right down the middle.

00:51.652 --> 00:52.484
>> DEE: Right down the middle

00:52.486 --> 00:53.585
sounds so boring.

00:53.587 --> 00:54.486
That's not what the audience

00:54.488 --> 00:55.354
wants to see.

00:55.356 --> 00:56.555
Thinking I'm gonna do a Jenny

00:56.557 --> 00:57.756
McCarthy thing, where I'm, like,

00:57.758 --> 00:59.024
super sexy, but I got a

00:59.026 --> 01:00.025
potty mouth.

01:00.027 --> 01:00.926
>> Ah-ah, no, no, Dee, you are

01:00.928 --> 01:01.760
never going to be sexy.

01:01.762 --> 01:02.561
And do not do a potty mouth

01:02.563 --> 01:03.395
thing, okay?

01:03.397 --> 01:04.263
We don't want to come across as

01:04.265 --> 01:05.564
low-brow animals.

01:05.566 --> 01:06.932
Now, have some veggie platter

01:06.934 --> 01:08.167
and have some fruit, okay?

01:08.169 --> 01:09.268
That is brain food.

01:09.270 --> 01:10.736
>> Mm-mm, no way, not me.

01:10.738 --> 01:11.737
Haven't eaten in three days.

01:11.739 --> 01:12.738
I don't want to be puffy.

01:12.740 --> 01:13.739
J-Mac's face...

01:13.741 --> 01:14.740
it's never puffy.

01:14.742 --> 01:15.607
>> Yeah, because J-Mac's face

01:15.609 --> 01:16.442
is stapled to the back of

01:16.444 --> 01:17.109
her head.

01:17.111 --> 01:17.943
Now, eat some food.

01:17.945 --> 01:19.344
You look emaciated and sick.

01:19.346 --> 01:21.747
(passing gas)

01:21.749 --> 01:23.348
What is that?

01:23.350 --> 01:24.850
>> Fart noise key chain.

01:24.852 --> 01:26.085
>> Dennis, what is this enticing

01:26.087 --> 01:27.286
bowl of white?

01:27.288 --> 01:28.087
>> This?

01:28.089 --> 01:29.088
>> Yeah.

01:29.090 --> 01:29.788
>> Charlie, that... that's

01:29.790 --> 01:30.522
cottage cheese.

01:30.524 --> 01:31.523
>><i> Cottage</i> cheese?

01:31.525 --> 01:32.524
Like... cheese from some

01:32.526 --> 01:33.525
cottage? Whose cottage?

01:33.527 --> 01:34.526
Well, like, what is that,

01:34.528 --> 01:35.427
exactly?

01:35.429 --> 01:36.128
>> How do you not know what

01:36.130 --> 01:36.862
it is?

01:36.864 --> 01:37.763
Aren't you, like, a cheese guy?

01:37.765 --> 01:39.131
>> I'm not a cottage guy.

01:39.133 --> 01:39.965
>> You are gonna make us lose

01:39.967 --> 01:41.567
this game.

01:41.569 --> 01:42.801
(audience cheering faintly)

01:42.803 --> 01:44.136
>> Here comes the other family.

01:44.138 --> 01:45.304
>> JANET: Hello.

01:45.306 --> 01:46.972
You must be the Reynolds family.

01:46.974 --> 01:48.307
I'm Janet, and we're the

01:48.309 --> 01:50.342
Barretts.

01:54.215 --> 01:55.714
Oh.

01:55.716 --> 01:58.050
Okay...

01:58.052 --> 01:59.284
>> LISA: Hey, guys!

01:59.286 --> 02:00.986
I'm Lisa. I'm stage manager.

02:00.988 --> 02:01.987
Both teams ready?

02:01.989 --> 02:03.555
(cheering)

02:03.557 --> 02:05.557
>> Let's play<i> Family Fight!</i>

02:28.916 --> 02:29.982
>> It's time to play

02:29.984 --> 02:31.817
<i> Family Fight!</i>

02:31.819 --> 02:34.019
Let's give it up for your host,

02:34.021 --> 02:36.688
Grant Anderson!

02:36.690 --> 02:38.357
(Grant laughing)

02:38.359 --> 02:39.358
>> How you doing, man?

02:39.360 --> 02:40.359
>> GRANT: Hey, oh!

02:40.361 --> 02:41.360
Hello!

02:41.362 --> 02:42.361
All right!

02:42.363 --> 02:43.529
Thank you for coming out,

02:43.531 --> 02:44.596
everybody, and welcome to

02:44.598 --> 02:45.664
<i> Family Fight.</i>

02:45.666 --> 02:46.932
I'm your host, Grant Anderson.

02:46.934 --> 02:48.967
Today, we have the Barrett

02:48.969 --> 02:50.135
family...

02:50.137 --> 02:51.203
(applause)

02:51.205 --> 02:53.105
Oh, all right.

02:53.107 --> 02:54.973
...versus the Reynolds family!

02:54.975 --> 02:58.343
(cheering)

02:58.345 --> 02:59.511
And they are here for a whole

02:59.513 --> 03:01.346
lot of cash, so let's get it on!

03:01.348 --> 03:03.515
Give me Janet, give me Frank.

03:03.517 --> 03:06.185
(cheering)

03:06.187 --> 03:07.953
>> Oh... whoa.

03:07.955 --> 03:09.555
Whoa, I didn't get a good look

03:09.557 --> 03:11.356
at you before backstage.

03:11.358 --> 03:12.558
(Janet laughs)

03:12.560 --> 03:14.126
Sha-booyah roll call.

03:14.128 --> 03:15.127
(whoops)

03:15.129 --> 03:15.961
>> Okay, all right, we got

03:15.963 --> 03:17.129
some-some sparks flying already

03:17.131 --> 03:18.130
here. (laughs)

03:18.132 --> 03:19.464
Now, let's get up here and do

03:19.466 --> 03:20.132
this.

03:20.134 --> 03:20.899
Come on, Frank, you ready?

03:20.901 --> 03:21.567
>> I'm ready.

03:21.569 --> 03:22.334
>> All right, man.

03:22.336 --> 03:23.335
Top four answers on the board,

03:23.337 --> 03:25.137
here: Name an animal that we eat

03:25.139 --> 03:26.138
but doesn't eat us.

03:26.140 --> 03:27.139
Frank!

03:27.141 --> 03:27.806
>> Pig!

03:27.808 --> 03:29.808
>> Show me pig!

03:29.810 --> 03:31.810
(cheering, applause)

03:31.812 --> 03:33.212
All right, oh, Frank's doing a

03:33.214 --> 03:34.213
little dance there.

03:34.215 --> 03:35.314
Now, Frank, you want to pass or

03:35.316 --> 03:36.315
play?

03:36.317 --> 03:37.182
Pass or play?

03:37.184 --> 03:38.016
>> Oh, we... we'll play.

03:38.018 --> 03:38.684
Play, play, play.

03:38.686 --> 03:39.685
We're gonna play.

03:39.687 --> 03:40.552
>> All right, so, Frank... you

03:40.554 --> 03:41.420
want to tell me a little bit

03:41.422 --> 03:42.054
about the family?

03:42.056 --> 03:42.888
>> Yeah.

03:42.890 --> 03:44.389
Well, yeah, you know, uh, Grant?

03:44.391 --> 03:45.390
>> Yes, Grant.

03:45.392 --> 03:46.525
>> I want to... I want to change

03:46.527 --> 03:47.826
my answer.

03:47.828 --> 03:48.594
>> What?

03:48.596 --> 03:49.394
>> Wh... what? Why?

03:49.396 --> 03:50.395
>> I have realized it's-it's not

03:50.397 --> 03:51.863
totally accurate, because I've

03:51.865 --> 03:54.333
seen a pig eat a man.

03:54.335 --> 03:56.768
In fact, I've seen many pigs eat

03:56.770 --> 03:58.337
many men.

03:58.339 --> 03:59.671
It was a bloodbath.

03:59.673 --> 04:00.672
>> Well, okay, well, we can't do

04:00.674 --> 04:01.440
that.

04:01.442 --> 04:02.174
I'm gonna move on, though,

04:02.176 --> 04:03.175
'cause you're losing me here.

04:03.177 --> 04:05.010
>> (laughing): Yeah?

04:05.012 --> 04:06.378
Oh, Grant... a lighthearted

04:06.380 --> 04:07.879
barb, if you will.

04:07.881 --> 04:08.914
>> So, uh, so...

04:08.916 --> 04:10.682
>> His talk of pigs and man

04:10.684 --> 04:11.850
flesh is confusing as it is

04:11.852 --> 04:12.918
frustrating.

04:12.920 --> 04:13.919
>> Right.

04:13.921 --> 04:14.920
>> Don't you just want to...

04:14.922 --> 04:15.921
>> I hear you, I hear you,

04:15.923 --> 04:16.588
Dennis.

04:16.590 --> 04:17.306
>> You know, you have these

04:17.307 --> 04:18.023
people in your life and you just

04:18.025 --> 04:18.690
want to...

04:18.692 --> 04:19.408
>> Yeah.

04:19.409 --> 04:20.125
Now, Dennis, uh, why don't you

04:20.127 --> 04:20.792
tell me something?

04:20.794 --> 04:21.460
What do you do?

04:21.462 --> 04:22.494
>> Me?

04:22.495 --> 04:23.527
Oh, well, I am the proprietor

04:23.530 --> 04:24.863
of, uh, one of the most charming

04:24.865 --> 04:25.697
pubs in all of South

04:25.699 --> 04:26.598
Philadelphia.

04:26.600 --> 04:27.266
>> All right.

04:27.268 --> 04:27.966
>> Paddy's Pub.

04:27.968 --> 04:29.034
>> Paddy's Pub! Paddy's Pub!

04:29.036 --> 04:30.035
>> Paddy's... Paddy's Pub.

04:30.037 --> 04:30.902
(cheering)

04:30.904 --> 04:31.703
>> Yeah.

04:31.705 --> 04:32.771
Yeah, but listen, I am so much

04:32.773 --> 04:34.039
more, Grant.

04:34.041 --> 04:35.374
Um, I'm kind of a jack of all

04:35.376 --> 04:36.308
trades, if you will.

04:36.310 --> 04:37.075
>> Okay.

04:37.077 --> 04:38.043
>> So the question really isn't

04:38.045 --> 04:39.244
"What do I do?"

04:39.246 --> 04:41.647
It's "What don't I do?"

04:41.649 --> 04:42.547
>> Wow.

04:42.549 --> 04:43.382
Now, there's a lot of confidence

04:43.384 --> 04:44.049
right there.

04:44.051 --> 04:44.716
I like that.

04:44.718 --> 04:45.550
I like that, Dennis.

04:45.552 --> 04:46.218
All right.

04:46.220 --> 04:46.997
>> Yeah.

04:46.998 --> 04:47.775
>> Hey, buddy, can you name an

04:47.776 --> 04:48.553
animal that we eat but doesn't

04:48.555 --> 04:49.221
eat us?

04:49.223 --> 04:50.055
>> Oh, easy.

04:50.057 --> 04:51.056
A sea urchin.

04:51.058 --> 04:52.224
>> A sea... a what now?

04:52.226 --> 04:53.725
>> Sea urchin.

04:53.727 --> 04:54.926
>> Sea urchin.

04:54.928 --> 04:55.727
>> Yeah.

04:55.729 --> 04:56.728
>> Okay.

04:56.730 --> 04:59.231
>> Show me sea urchin!

04:59.233 --> 05:00.432
(buzzer blares)

05:00.434 --> 05:01.767
Ooh, one strike.

05:01.769 --> 05:02.618
>> Oh.

05:02.619 --> 05:03.468
>> One strike for the Reynolds

05:03.470 --> 05:04.186
here.

05:04.187 --> 05:04.903
>> Wow, that, uh, that buzzer

05:04.905 --> 05:06.071
sounds... it's awfully loud.

05:06.073 --> 05:06.938
>> It is loud.

05:06.940 --> 05:07.639
>> Pierces you right down to

05:07.641 --> 05:08.740
your soul, doesn't it?

05:08.742 --> 05:09.408
I don't like it.

05:09.410 --> 05:10.342
>> Okay.

05:10.344 --> 05:11.076
>> I'll be fine, though.

05:11.078 --> 05:11.743
>> You're right.

05:11.745 --> 05:12.477
All right, thank you.

05:12.479 --> 05:13.145
>> Okay.

05:13.147 --> 05:13.812
>> Who do we have here?

05:13.814 --> 05:14.479
>> Hi.

05:14.481 --> 05:15.747
>> Hello... Deandra.

05:15.749 --> 05:16.415
>> Yep.

05:16.417 --> 05:17.282
>> Reynolds.

05:17.284 --> 05:18.317
Deandra, help me out-- name an

05:18.319 --> 05:19.484
animal that we eat but doesn't

05:19.486 --> 05:20.686
eat us.

05:20.688 --> 05:21.586
>> Well, Grant, I'll tell you

05:21.588 --> 05:22.254
what...

05:22.256 --> 05:22.988
>> Mm-hmm?

05:22.990 --> 05:23.989
>> ...I like to eat cock.

05:23.991 --> 05:24.656
(audience exclaims)

05:24.658 --> 05:27.192
>> Whoa, no, no, no, no, no.

05:27.194 --> 05:28.293
No, we can't say...

05:28.295 --> 05:29.861
Lisa, are we gonna...?

05:29.863 --> 05:30.696
>> See what I did there?

05:30.698 --> 05:31.463
It's a little bit of a double

05:31.465 --> 05:33.131
entendre type of thing.

05:33.133 --> 05:33.932
I was talking about chicken, but

05:33.934 --> 05:34.766
I said "cock."

05:34.768 --> 05:35.967
>> Yeah, don't say that word.

05:35.969 --> 05:36.968
Please, I'm-I'm...

05:36.970 --> 05:38.170
Just, it's a family show, so

05:38.172 --> 05:38.870
we're just gonna go with

05:38.872 --> 05:39.671
"chicken," okay?

05:39.673 --> 05:41.306
Show me chicken!

05:41.308 --> 05:42.474
>> Ow!

05:42.476 --> 05:43.141
>> There you go.

05:43.143 --> 05:46.478
(cheering)

05:46.480 --> 05:47.612
>> Okay.

05:47.614 --> 05:48.814
Ronald Reynolds.

05:48.816 --> 05:49.815
>> Yeah!

05:49.817 --> 05:50.449
>> Hello, sir.

05:50.451 --> 05:51.116
>> Hey!

05:51.118 --> 05:51.783
>> How you doing today?

05:51.785 --> 05:52.618
>> I'm great, Grant.

05:52.619 --> 05:53.452
I'm just really excited to be

05:53.454 --> 05:54.286
here with my new family.

05:54.288 --> 05:55.620
>> Oh... your new family?

05:55.622 --> 05:56.288
>> Yeah.

05:56.290 --> 05:56.955
Oh, a little bit of

05:56.957 --> 05:57.622
background.

05:57.624 --> 05:58.290
>> Yeah, yeah, yeah.

05:58.292 --> 05:59.024
>> Uh, actually, just for

05:59.026 --> 06:00.225
clarification.

06:00.227 --> 06:02.160
Um, he raised them, but he

06:02.162 --> 06:03.462
didn't sire them.

06:03.464 --> 06:04.696
Now, he may have sired him--

06:04.698 --> 06:06.465
we're not exactly sure, but they

06:06.467 --> 06:07.632
do live together in squalor.

06:07.634 --> 06:08.300
>> Yeah, yeah.

06:08.302 --> 06:09.201
I actually brought my blood

06:09.203 --> 06:10.168
bucket in case you guys want to

06:10.170 --> 06:11.169
run his blood and see if it all

06:11.171 --> 06:11.837
checks out.

06:11.839 --> 06:12.605
It'd be good to know.

06:12.606 --> 06:13.372
>> Yeah, if we want to do, like,

06:13.374 --> 06:14.306
a quick DNA sequencing...

06:14.308 --> 06:15.057
>> Yeah.

06:15.058 --> 06:15.807
>> ...at the commercial break,

06:15.809 --> 06:16.508
that actually would clear things

06:16.510 --> 06:17.175
up for everybody.

06:17.177 --> 06:17.909
>> If we could.

06:17.911 --> 06:18.577
>> It would set the record

06:18.579 --> 06:19.278
straight.

06:19.279 --> 06:19.978
But either way, I was always the

06:19.980 --> 06:20.712
odd man out, you know?

06:20.714 --> 06:21.646
I mean, you know.

06:21.648 --> 06:22.814
And then Frank, here, adopted me

06:22.816 --> 06:24.216
and now I'm a part of the

06:24.218 --> 06:25.851
Reynolds family!

06:25.853 --> 06:27.819
>> Okay, well...

06:27.821 --> 06:29.855
We don't...

06:29.857 --> 06:31.056
I'm... I'm just... I'm not even

06:31.058 --> 06:32.157
gonna try to figure that one

06:32.159 --> 06:33.525
out, so...

06:33.527 --> 06:34.559
Okay, here-here's the deal,

06:34.561 --> 06:35.694
guys: from now on, I'm not gonna

06:35.696 --> 06:37.262
ask you guys any more questions

06:37.264 --> 06:38.263
at all...

06:38.265 --> 06:39.147
>> Yes.

06:39.148 --> 06:40.030
>> ...other than the ones that

06:40.033 --> 06:41.032
keep the game moving. All right?

06:41.034 --> 06:42.267
>> Great! Yeah!

06:42.269 --> 06:44.002
Great! (whoops)

06:44.004 --> 06:45.570
Show me... cow!

06:45.572 --> 06:46.505
>> Nope, that's me.

06:46.507 --> 06:47.406
I say that word.

06:47.408 --> 06:48.673
I say the "show me" part.

06:48.675 --> 06:49.708
You just give me the answer.

06:49.710 --> 06:50.575
Okay, Ronald?

06:50.577 --> 06:51.343
>> Right, I'm sorry.

06:51.345 --> 06:52.110
Show me c...

06:52.112 --> 06:53.111
>> Don't say "show me."

06:53.113 --> 06:53.779
>> He just said that.

06:53.781 --> 06:54.513
>> Don't say it.

06:54.515 --> 06:55.180
>> He just said that.

06:55.182 --> 06:55.948
>> Just say the answer.

06:55.949 --> 06:56.715
>> Show... show me.. is the part

06:56.717 --> 06:57.382
I say?

06:57.384 --> 06:58.283
>> Here's the one thing...

06:58.285 --> 06:59.184
there's only one thing in the

06:59.186 --> 07:00.252
whole world at this moment you

07:00.254 --> 07:01.019
shouldn't say...

07:01.021 --> 07:01.853
>> Mm-hmm?

07:01.855 --> 07:02.738
>> "Show me."

07:02.739 --> 07:03.622
So just give me the answer, and

07:03.624 --> 07:04.623
then I'll say sh...

07:04.625 --> 07:05.624
You know what, go ahead and

07:05.626 --> 07:06.691
do it.

07:06.693 --> 07:08.026
Just go ahead and do it, then.

07:08.028 --> 07:09.394
>> Do what?

07:09.396 --> 07:10.429
>> Mother of...

07:10.431 --> 07:11.696
Show me cow!

07:11.698 --> 07:12.697
>> Cow!

07:12.699 --> 07:16.635
(all cheering)

07:16.637 --> 07:18.570
>> Good answer!

07:18.572 --> 07:20.071
>> So, sadly we got to stay

07:20.073 --> 07:21.606
here. Okay.

07:21.608 --> 07:22.641
Charlie?

07:22.643 --> 07:23.642
>> Yeah?

07:23.644 --> 07:24.643
>> Just need you to name an

07:24.645 --> 07:25.644
animal...

07:25.646 --> 07:26.645
>> Yeah!

07:26.647 --> 07:27.712
>> ...that we eat but doesn't

07:27.714 --> 07:28.747
eat us.

07:28.749 --> 07:29.781
>> Doesn't eat us-- that's easy.

07:29.783 --> 07:33.452
Dragon!

07:33.454 --> 07:35.120
>> Charlie, do you eat dragon?

07:35.122 --> 07:36.221
>> No! I don't eat dragon

07:36.223 --> 07:37.722
'cause, uh, it's-it's not a meal

07:37.724 --> 07:38.723
for peasants, it's a meal

07:38.725 --> 07:39.724
for kings, and I'm sort of a

07:39.726 --> 07:40.725
common man.

07:40.727 --> 07:41.726
But they don't eat us; they, uh,

07:41.728 --> 07:42.727
it's like a misconception.

07:42.729 --> 07:43.728
They actually eat gold and

07:43.730 --> 07:44.729
treasure.

07:44.731 --> 07:45.730
That's why they're always

07:45.732 --> 07:46.731
sitting on a big pile of it.

07:46.733 --> 07:47.732
>> Bad answer.

07:47.734 --> 07:48.733
>> Bad answer.

07:48.735 --> 07:49.734
>> Bad answer.

07:49.736 --> 07:50.735
>> That's a bad answer.

07:50.737 --> 07:52.304
>> Okay, show me dragon!

07:54.775 --> 07:56.308
(Charlie laughing)

07:56.310 --> 07:57.809
>> I told you!

07:57.811 --> 07:59.311
>> Oh, my God!

07:59.313 --> 08:00.912
(Grant laughs)

08:00.914 --> 08:02.514
>> Well, astonishingly, uh, one

08:02.516 --> 08:04.916
person surveyed gave the answer

08:04.918 --> 08:07.118
dragon, so...

08:07.120 --> 08:08.753
What a world!

08:08.755 --> 08:10.589
All right, the Reynolds family

08:10.591 --> 08:12.257
has won round one!

08:12.259 --> 08:13.625
(all cheering)

08:13.627 --> 08:14.960
There you go, all right.

08:14.962 --> 08:15.961
>> Sha-booyah!

08:15.963 --> 08:16.962
>> All right.

08:16.964 --> 08:17.963
>> Sha-booyah!

08:17.965 --> 08:18.964
>> But we got a lot more show to

08:18.966 --> 08:20.098
go! It could be anybody's game.

08:20.100 --> 08:21.299
We'll be right back after this

08:21.301 --> 08:22.868
with<i> Family Fight!</i>

08:22.870 --> 08:25.937
(all cheering)

08:25.939 --> 08:27.272
>> That's commercial, guys!

08:27.274 --> 08:28.273
Back in three.

08:28.275 --> 08:29.274
>> Yeah!

08:29.276 --> 08:30.275
>> Yeah!

08:30.277 --> 08:31.276
>> Yeah, that was, uh, that was

08:31.278 --> 08:32.277
terrible.

08:32.279 --> 08:33.278
I mean, we're bombing out there.

08:33.280 --> 08:34.279
This-this is exactly what I was

08:34.281 --> 08:35.280
trying to avoid, guys.

08:35.282 --> 08:36.281
>> What are you talking about?

08:36.283 --> 08:37.282
We won that round.

08:37.284 --> 08:38.283
>> Yeah, but you were being

08:38.285 --> 08:39.284
lascivious and disgusting.

08:39.286 --> 08:40.285
Dee was making sex jokes that

08:40.287 --> 08:41.286
were going over like a lead

08:41.288 --> 08:42.120
balloon.

08:42.121 --> 08:42.953
>> Well, at least we got all of

08:42.956 --> 08:43.622
our answers right.

08:43.624 --> 08:44.623
>> Yeah, that-that's utterly

08:44.625 --> 08:45.624
ridiculous.

08:45.626 --> 08:46.625
I mean, how is dragon an answer

08:46.627 --> 08:47.626
and sea urchin isn't?

08:47.628 --> 08:48.293
Everyone knows...

08:48.295 --> 08:49.294
>> I don't know, but there's

08:49.296 --> 08:50.295
always a weirdo or two in those

08:50.297 --> 08:51.296
panels who's gonna give a stupid

08:51.298 --> 08:52.297
answer and Charlie's always

08:52.299 --> 08:53.298
gonna get those, right? So...

08:53.300 --> 08:54.299
>> Yeah, I'll get the steal.

08:54.301 --> 08:55.300
>> Yeah!

08:55.302 --> 08:56.301
>> Plus, people don't even

08:56.303 --> 08:57.302
really eat sea urchin, Dennis.

08:57.304 --> 08:58.303
>> Most people don't eat

08:58.305 --> 08:59.304
dragons.

08:59.306 --> 09:00.305
>> Well, dragonflies.

09:00.307 --> 09:01.306
>> People don't eat dragonflies.

09:01.308 --> 09:02.307
(Charlie imitates buzzer)

09:02.309 --> 09:03.308
Don't make that noise.

09:03.310 --> 09:03.975
I don't like it.

09:03.977 --> 09:04.976
>> Just relax, would you,

09:04.978 --> 09:05.677
Dennis?

09:05.678 --> 09:06.377
Look, if we make asses out of

09:06.380 --> 09:07.178
ourselves, they just won't air

09:07.180 --> 09:08.179
the episode, okay?

09:08.181 --> 09:09.180
>> Okay, first of all, you don't

09:09.182 --> 09:09.981
know that, and secondly, don't

09:09.983 --> 09:10.649
tell me to relax.

09:10.651 --> 09:11.650
(Mac imitates buzzer)

09:11.652 --> 09:12.417
All right, don't you start

09:12.419 --> 09:13.084
making that noise.

09:13.086 --> 09:13.802
(Frank imitates buzzer)

09:13.803 --> 09:14.519
All right, it's not funny when

09:14.521 --> 09:15.320
they do it, it's definitely not

09:15.322 --> 09:15.987
funny when...

09:15.989 --> 09:16.655
(Dee imitates buzzer)

09:16.657 --> 09:17.322
(Dennis yelling)

09:17.324 --> 09:18.023
(all imitating buzzer)

09:18.025 --> 09:19.891
Oh, goddamn it!

09:23.764 --> 09:25.263
(all cheering)

09:25.265 --> 09:26.264
>> And welcome back to

09:26.266 --> 09:27.832
<i> Family Fight.</i>

09:27.834 --> 09:28.867
We got the Reynolds family over

09:28.869 --> 09:30.068
here with a hundred points.

09:30.070 --> 09:31.069
We got the Barretts over here

09:31.071 --> 09:32.103
with zero.

09:32.105 --> 09:33.905
Give me Bobby, give me Dennis!

09:33.907 --> 09:36.741
>> Here we go!

09:36.743 --> 09:37.876
Okay.

09:37.878 --> 09:38.910
Hey, Bobby, all right.

09:38.912 --> 09:40.845
All right, somebody got a

09:40.847 --> 09:42.080
little, a little lead in his

09:42.082 --> 09:43.081
shoes.

09:43.083 --> 09:44.716
>> Uh, no.

09:44.718 --> 09:47.352
No. No, my shoes are fine.

09:47.354 --> 09:48.720
I assure you.

09:48.722 --> 09:49.854
They're made of the finest

09:49.856 --> 09:50.855
Italian leather.

09:50.857 --> 09:51.856
The fit is perfect.

09:51.858 --> 09:52.857
Therefore, there would be no

09:52.859 --> 09:55.727
room for lead.

09:55.729 --> 09:56.962
>> All right.

09:56.964 --> 09:58.063
The top four answers are on the

09:58.065 --> 09:59.230
board.

09:59.232 --> 10:00.231
We asked a hundred people on the

10:00.233 --> 10:01.266
street, "Name something people

10:01.268 --> 10:03.068
groom themselves with."

10:03.070 --> 10:04.269
Dennis!

10:04.271 --> 10:05.737
>> Laser beams, Grant.

10:05.739 --> 10:07.205
>> La-Laser beams?

10:07.207 --> 10:08.039
>> Yeah, laser beam.

10:08.041 --> 10:09.040
It's the only way to completely

10:09.042 --> 10:10.141
obliterate the follicle.

10:10.143 --> 10:12.110
>> Show me laser beam!

10:12.112 --> 10:13.411
(buzzer blares)

10:13.413 --> 10:15.614
>> Oh, yeah, yeah.

10:15.616 --> 10:17.215
That noise, it's too loud.

10:17.217 --> 10:18.216
Can we, can we just turn it down

10:18.218 --> 10:19.384
a touch?

10:19.386 --> 10:20.385
>> We cannot, we cannot.

10:20.387 --> 10:21.386
Bobby, you got an answer?

10:21.388 --> 10:22.387
>> I got an answer.

10:22.389 --> 10:23.388
>> All right.

10:23.390 --> 10:24.389
>> Hair brush!

10:24.391 --> 10:25.390
>> Show me hair brush!

10:25.392 --> 10:26.758
(dings)

10:26.760 --> 10:29.928
(cheering)

10:29.930 --> 10:30.929
>> Hair brush, that's so

10:30.931 --> 10:31.930
obvious.

10:31.932 --> 10:32.931
God, that buzzer noise!

10:32.933 --> 10:33.932
Isn't that just irritating

10:33.934 --> 10:34.599
as hell?

10:34.601 --> 10:35.600
>> Come on, we got to think

10:35.602 --> 10:36.601
of a steal here, okay?

10:36.603 --> 10:37.435
>> I got one, I got one!

10:37.436 --> 10:38.268
What about, uh, uh, bleaching

10:38.271 --> 10:39.270
cream for your facial hair?

10:39.272 --> 10:40.271
>> What the hell?!

10:40.273 --> 10:41.272
>> No, no. I-I got it.

10:41.274 --> 10:42.273
Drakkar Noir.

10:42.275 --> 10:43.274
>> Mm, too specific.

10:43.276 --> 10:44.275
>> You know what it is?

10:44.277 --> 10:45.276
I think it's a bride.

10:45.278 --> 10:46.277
A bride could be a good answer.

10:46.279 --> 10:47.278
(dings)

10:47.280 --> 10:48.680
>> What?

10:48.682 --> 10:49.681
>> You can't become a groom or

10:49.683 --> 10:50.749
get groomed without a bride.

10:50.751 --> 10:51.750
>> Oh, no, no...

10:51.752 --> 10:52.751
>> Right, right. That's not the

10:52.753 --> 10:53.752
kind of grooming they're

10:53.754 --> 10:54.753
talking about.

10:54.755 --> 10:55.420
>> I don't know.

10:55.422 --> 10:56.421
Charlie could be right.

10:56.423 --> 10:57.422
>> Uh, yeah, I... I got dragon.

10:57.424 --> 10:58.423
>> No, he's not, he's not right!

10:58.425 --> 10:59.424
Because nobody else is that

10:59.426 --> 11:00.425
stupid.

11:00.427 --> 11:01.960
>> Show me pumice stone!

11:01.962 --> 11:03.328
(buzzer blares)

11:03.330 --> 11:04.329
All right, here we go.

11:04.331 --> 11:05.463
Reynolds family for the steal!

11:05.465 --> 11:06.464
>> No, no, we're not gonna say

11:06.466 --> 11:07.465
that.

11:07.467 --> 11:08.500
>> The comb, a comb!

11:08.502 --> 11:11.002
>> I'm gonna go with...

11:11.004 --> 11:12.871
toe knife.

11:12.873 --> 11:14.773
>> With what now?

11:14.775 --> 11:16.374
>> With a toe knife 'cause I-I

11:16.376 --> 11:18.677
use a-a sharp blade to dig the

11:18.679 --> 11:21.613
scum out of my toenails.

11:21.615 --> 11:23.815
Once in a while, I cut myself,

11:23.817 --> 11:25.650
but it puses up and in three

11:25.652 --> 11:27.118
days, it's good as new.

11:27.120 --> 11:28.119
>> Sure.

11:28.121 --> 11:29.320
>> Toe knife!

11:29.322 --> 11:30.555
>> Way more information than we

11:30.557 --> 11:32.323
needed, but, uh...

11:32.325 --> 11:34.292
show me toe knife.

11:34.294 --> 11:35.994
(buzzer blares)

11:35.996 --> 11:37.295
Okay, the Barretts win the

11:37.297 --> 11:38.697
board!

11:38.699 --> 11:40.965
There you go! All right!

11:40.967 --> 11:42.000
Okay, let's see-see what that

11:42.002 --> 11:43.234
last answer was.

11:43.236 --> 11:44.335
(dings)

11:44.337 --> 11:45.336
Bride!

11:45.338 --> 11:46.337
>> Charlie was right.

11:46.339 --> 11:47.338
>> I knew it.

11:47.340 --> 11:48.339
>> Do you, do you groom a

11:48.341 --> 11:49.340
bride, Lisa?

11:49.342 --> 11:50.341
All right, hey, let's get onto

11:50.343 --> 11:51.509
that last round now!

11:51.511 --> 11:52.510
I need some Dee, I need a little

11:52.512 --> 11:54.746
bit of Lester! Come on down!

11:54.748 --> 11:55.747
Okay.

11:55.749 --> 11:56.748
>> Come on, Dee!

11:56.750 --> 11:57.749
(cheering)

11:57.751 --> 11:59.751
>> All right.

11:59.753 --> 12:01.720
>> Okay, here we go-- top six

12:01.722 --> 12:03.688
answers are on the board.

12:03.690 --> 12:04.756
Name something that people

12:04.758 --> 12:06.858
are afraid of.

12:06.860 --> 12:09.761
(all gasping)

12:09.763 --> 12:11.096
>> Oh, oopsie-daisy!

12:11.098 --> 12:12.664
Looks like I, I broke it.

12:12.666 --> 12:14.099
>> You think?

12:14.101 --> 12:15.433
>> Oops.

12:15.435 --> 12:16.501
>> Can't believe that's...

12:16.503 --> 12:17.502
Ain't never seen anything like

12:17.504 --> 12:18.503
that in my life.

12:18.505 --> 12:19.504
What do you got, hands made of

12:19.506 --> 12:20.505
anvils?

12:20.507 --> 12:21.506
(laughter)

12:21.508 --> 12:22.507
>> You want me to answer that or

12:22.509 --> 12:23.541
answer the-- this one?

12:23.543 --> 12:25.243
>> I don't want you to answer

12:25.245 --> 12:26.444
either of them, okay?

12:26.446 --> 12:27.545
>> Yeah, sorry.

12:27.547 --> 12:28.546
>> Because I don't know who won

12:28.548 --> 12:29.547
because you broke the machine.

12:29.549 --> 12:30.548
>> That makes sense.

12:30.550 --> 12:31.549
>> Right? Okay?

12:31.551 --> 12:32.550
>> It makes sense, yeah.

12:32.552 --> 12:33.551
>> Okay, everybody, we're gonna

12:33.553 --> 12:35.420
take a couple seconds.

12:35.422 --> 12:37.088
We'll be right back after this.

12:37.090 --> 12:38.089
>> Okay.

12:38.091 --> 12:40.125
(cheering)

12:47.134 --> 12:48.133
(buzzer blares)

12:48.135 --> 12:49.234
>> Ooh, ooh, ooh!

12:49.236 --> 12:50.235
>> Start thinking of a steal

12:50.237 --> 12:51.236
because if we get this one, we

12:51.238 --> 12:52.237
win the game.

12:52.239 --> 12:53.238
>> All right, all right.

12:53.240 --> 12:54.239
What's the question?

12:54.241 --> 12:55.406
>> Things people are afraid of.

12:55.408 --> 12:57.075
>> That's still the question?

12:57.077 --> 12:58.109
>> Yeah... How do you not know

12:58.111 --> 12:59.244
how the game works by now?

12:59.246 --> 13:00.245
>> Okay, I'm afraid of game show

13:00.247 --> 13:01.279
rules.

13:01.281 --> 13:02.313
>> You guys, I know what it is.

13:02.315 --> 13:03.314
>> Yeah?

13:03.316 --> 13:04.315
>> It's failure.

13:04.317 --> 13:05.316
>> That's too pathetic.

13:05.318 --> 13:06.317
>> Liberal yahoos taking my

13:06.319 --> 13:07.318
guns.

13:07.320 --> 13:08.453
>> That-that is a political

13:08.455 --> 13:09.754
firestorm, Frank. No!

13:09.756 --> 13:11.456
>> Oh, oh! The Nightman.

13:11.458 --> 13:12.924
>> All right, guys, these are

13:12.926 --> 13:14.325
terrible answers, all right?

13:14.327 --> 13:15.627
Now, normally I would've said

13:15.629 --> 13:16.995
the crust on a crème brûlée

13:16.997 --> 13:18.263
burning the top of your mouth,

13:18.265 --> 13:19.264
but I'm thinking like a commoner

13:19.266 --> 13:20.498
now and I really do think that

13:20.500 --> 13:22.133
the right answer is probably...

13:22.135 --> 13:23.234
clowns.

13:23.236 --> 13:24.235
>> That's a good answer.

13:24.237 --> 13:25.236
>> I know.

13:25.238 --> 13:26.237
>> I feel like it could

13:26.239 --> 13:27.238
be Nightman.

13:27.240 --> 13:28.239
>> No, I feel like it isn't

13:28.241 --> 13:29.240
the Nightman...

13:29.242 --> 13:30.241
>> He could be right, dude.

13:30.243 --> 13:31.242
>> I've got a lot...

13:31.244 --> 13:32.243
>> Show me dogs!

13:32.245 --> 13:33.244
(buzzer blares)

13:33.246 --> 13:34.245
(Barretts groan)

13:34.247 --> 13:36.447
God (bleep)!

13:36.449 --> 13:37.448
Okay, Reynolds, you get a

13:37.450 --> 13:38.516
chance to steal and win the

13:38.518 --> 13:40.151
whole game right here.

13:40.153 --> 13:42.120
Name something that people are

13:42.122 --> 13:43.354
afraid of.

13:43.356 --> 13:44.355
(Frank clears throat)

13:44.357 --> 13:45.356
>> We're gonna go with...

13:45.358 --> 13:46.357
>> Wait, wait, wait, Frank.

13:46.359 --> 13:47.358
You have to say it in the form

13:47.360 --> 13:48.359
of a question.

13:48.361 --> 13:49.360
>> What is...?

13:49.362 --> 13:50.361
>> No, you don't, you don't...

13:50.363 --> 13:51.362
you don't have to do that 'cause

13:51.364 --> 13:52.363
it's not<i> Jeopardy.</i>

13:52.365 --> 13:53.364
>> Ah, it's not<i> Jeopardy.</i>

13:53.366 --> 13:54.365
>> All right?

13:54.367 --> 13:55.500
>> Say "show me," Frank.

13:55.502 --> 13:56.835
>> Don't say "show me," Frank.

13:56.837 --> 13:57.869
Just say the word.

13:57.871 --> 13:59.037
Just say the word.

13:59.039 --> 13:59.971
>> Show me clowns!

13:59.973 --> 14:00.705
>> All right.

14:00.707 --> 14:02.941
Show me clowns!

14:02.943 --> 14:03.975
(cheering)

14:03.977 --> 14:04.642
>> Yeah!

14:04.644 --> 14:05.310
We did it!

14:05.312 --> 14:06.611
We did it!

14:06.613 --> 14:07.612
>> And the Reynolds win

14:07.614 --> 14:08.613
the game!

14:08.615 --> 14:09.614
The Reynolds win the game!

14:09.616 --> 14:10.715
>> (chanting): Sha-booyah,

14:10.717 --> 14:12.317
sha-booyah, sha-booyah,

14:12.319 --> 14:13.218
you lose!

14:13.220 --> 14:14.819
Sha-booyah, sha-booyah,

14:14.821 --> 14:16.554
sha-booyah, you lose!

14:16.556 --> 14:18.056
>> All right, okay.

14:18.058 --> 14:19.457
So, anyway... (chuckles)

14:19.459 --> 14:20.458
let's take a look at the last

14:20.460 --> 14:24.062
one, everybody.

14:24.064 --> 14:25.063
"Nightman."

14:25.065 --> 14:26.331
Don't know what that is.

14:26.333 --> 14:27.632
Just don't know what it is.

14:27.634 --> 14:28.633
>> What is happening?

14:28.635 --> 14:29.901
>> Pretty strange answers today!

14:29.903 --> 14:31.169
(audience laughs)

14:31.171 --> 14:31.970
All right, man.

14:31.972 --> 14:32.904
Uh, we're gonna come right back

14:32.906 --> 14:33.905
and play some Fast Money.

14:33.907 --> 14:34.706
We'll see you right after these

14:34.708 --> 14:35.373
messages.

14:35.375 --> 14:37.408
(cheering, applause)

14:43.884 --> 14:45.083
>> How the hell was "Nightman"

14:45.085 --> 14:45.583
an answer?

14:45.585 --> 14:46.251
>> Right.

14:46.252 --> 14:46.918
>> Dude, I think I'm remembering

14:46.920 --> 14:47.585
what happened.

14:47.587 --> 14:48.586
I took this survey.

14:48.588 --> 14:49.854
I got interviewed at a mall and

14:49.856 --> 14:50.521
I thought it was, like, a

14:50.523 --> 14:51.356
government thing.

14:51.358 --> 14:52.023
>> Oh...

14:52.025 --> 14:52.891
>> Okay, all right.

14:52.892 --> 14:53.758
>> That makes a lot more sense.

14:53.760 --> 14:54.525
>> That's actually the only

14:54.527 --> 14:55.426
thing that makes sense.

14:55.428 --> 14:56.094
>> Right? Okay.

14:56.096 --> 14:56.861
So I should play Fast Money,

14:56.863 --> 14:57.595
because I'm gonna know all the

14:57.597 --> 14:58.346
answers.

14:58.347 --> 14:59.096
>> No, no, no, you're only gonna

14:59.099 --> 14:59.864
know<i> your</i> answers.

14:59.866 --> 15:00.698
And that's only gonna get us one

15:00.700 --> 15:02.000
point for every question.

15:02.002 --> 15:03.067
We need to get all the top

15:03.069 --> 15:03.902
answers to win Fast Money.

15:03.904 --> 15:04.736
>> Right, totally, totally.

15:04.738 --> 15:05.570
And then we spin the wheel.

15:05.572 --> 15:06.571
>> Okay, you're definitely not

15:06.573 --> 15:07.605
gonna play, 'cause you can't

15:07.607 --> 15:08.506
understand a thing that's

15:08.508 --> 15:09.107
happening.

15:09.109 --> 15:09.824
>> I'll play.

15:09.825 --> 15:10.540
>> No, you won't play, because

15:10.543 --> 15:11.342
you've been nothing but gross

15:11.344 --> 15:12.377
and foul and polarizing the

15:12.379 --> 15:13.111
entire time.

15:13.113 --> 15:13.912
You're embarrassing me in front

15:13.914 --> 15:14.579
of the whole nation.

15:14.581 --> 15:15.246
Dee...

15:15.248 --> 15:16.014
>> Mmm.

15:16.015 --> 15:16.781
>> ...you and I are gonna play.

15:16.783 --> 15:17.348
>> Yeah?

15:17.350 --> 15:18.082
>> Mm-hmm.

15:18.083 --> 15:18.815
>> Can I do my fart keychain?

15:18.816 --> 15:19.548
>> Absolutely goddamn not.

15:19.552 --> 15:20.351
Okay, now go get something to

15:20.353 --> 15:21.119
eat, you look terrible.

15:21.121 --> 15:21.886
>> No, no, no, no, no, no.

15:21.888 --> 15:22.720
I'm very hungry, but I'm not

15:22.722 --> 15:23.421
gonna blow it now.

15:23.423 --> 15:24.389
This is my close-up.

15:24.391 --> 15:25.256
>> (sighs) God, don't be a dumb,

15:25.258 --> 15:26.391
hungry bitch the entire time.

15:26.393 --> 15:27.125
>> Guys, we're back.

15:27.127 --> 15:27.837
>> Ooh!

15:27.838 --> 15:28.548
>> Okay, all right, you're going

15:28.549 --> 15:29.259
first, Dee, you're going first.

15:29.262 --> 15:30.728
>> Come on, Dee, go, Dee!

15:30.730 --> 15:31.729
>> Here we go.

15:31.731 --> 15:34.232
(applause, cheering)

15:34.234 --> 15:35.600
>> All right, we are back with

15:35.602 --> 15:36.901
Fast Money, here with Dee

15:36.903 --> 15:38.403
Reynolds.

15:38.405 --> 15:39.971
But first, there's somebody who

15:39.973 --> 15:42.106
wants to say something to you.

15:42.108 --> 15:43.741
>> CRICKET: Hey, Reynolds

15:43.743 --> 15:44.742
family!

15:44.744 --> 15:46.277
Win $20,000 and bring home the

15:46.279 --> 15:47.578
money for Paddy's Pub!

15:47.580 --> 15:48.613
(chuckles)

15:48.615 --> 15:50.448
Yeah, all right.

15:50.450 --> 15:51.482
I'm done dancing like a monkey.

15:51.484 --> 15:52.550
Give me my five bucks, Charlie.

15:52.552 --> 15:53.785
(audience exclaiming)

15:53.787 --> 15:54.652
>> Ha-ha, wow!

15:54.654 --> 15:55.386
That was a rough video, right

15:55.388 --> 15:56.237
there.

15:56.238 --> 15:57.087
That dude is hard on the eyes.

15:57.090 --> 15:57.789
>> Yeah.

15:57.791 --> 15:58.890
He's all burned up.

15:58.892 --> 16:00.291
>> We couldn't get anybody else?

16:00.293 --> 16:01.592
>> (chuckles) No.

16:01.594 --> 16:03.161
>> Okay, you ready, Dee?

16:03.163 --> 16:04.729
>> Oh, you better believe it.

16:04.731 --> 16:05.463
But, uh...

16:05.465 --> 16:06.281
>> Mm-hmm?

16:06.282 --> 16:07.098
>> ...first, hold on a... hold

16:07.100 --> 16:08.299
on a second, there's, um...

16:08.301 --> 16:09.634
>> Yeah?

16:09.636 --> 16:10.668
>> There's, uh...

16:10.670 --> 16:11.336
>> You okay?

16:11.338 --> 16:12.003
>> Ooh! Yeah.

16:12.005 --> 16:13.004
>> You all right?

16:13.006 --> 16:14.772
>> Uh, yes... there's a... just

16:14.774 --> 16:17.241
a quick bit I wanted to, uh...

16:17.243 --> 16:18.242
Oof.

16:18.244 --> 16:19.243
(audience exclaims)

16:19.245 --> 16:20.511
(farting noises)

16:20.513 --> 16:21.579
>> Oh, whoops-a-daisy.

16:21.581 --> 16:23.114
(laughs)

16:23.116 --> 16:23.948
(farting noises continue)

16:23.950 --> 16:24.682
>> That's about as low-brow as

16:24.684 --> 16:25.416
it gets.

16:25.417 --> 16:26.149
>> Yeah, Dennis isn't gonna like

16:26.152 --> 16:27.151
that.

16:27.152 --> 16:28.151
>> It's pretty funny, though.

16:28.154 --> 16:29.988
>> Okay, new plan.

16:29.990 --> 16:31.289
(audience cheering)

16:31.291 --> 16:32.824
>> All right.

16:32.826 --> 16:34.092
So we're back here with, uh,

16:34.094 --> 16:36.094
Fast Money here.

16:36.096 --> 16:38.262
Uh, now we got Frank doing it,

16:38.264 --> 16:39.797
'cause... people just be

16:39.799 --> 16:41.532
faintin' up in here, so, okay,

16:41.534 --> 16:44.135
give me 30 seconds on the clock.

16:44.137 --> 16:45.136
Name something you thought

16:45.138 --> 16:46.337
existed when you were a child.

16:46.339 --> 16:47.338
>> Santa Claus.

16:47.340 --> 16:48.339
>> Name something you might find

16:48.341 --> 16:49.474
in a bathtub.

16:49.476 --> 16:50.341
>> Soap!

16:50.343 --> 16:51.275
>> Name something people add

16:51.277 --> 16:52.176
sugar to.

16:52.178 --> 16:53.177
>> Coffee.

16:53.179 --> 16:54.345
>> A thing you associate with

16:54.347 --> 16:55.480
Charlie Chaplin.

16:55.482 --> 16:56.381
>> Little mustache.

16:56.383 --> 16:57.482
>> Name a foreign country whose

16:57.484 --> 16:59.517
films are popular in America.

16:59.519 --> 17:00.518
>> France.

17:00.520 --> 17:01.519
(cheering)

17:01.521 --> 17:02.487
>> Damn!

17:02.489 --> 17:04.322
You did it, man...

17:04.324 --> 17:05.656
>> Oh, oh, that was so good!

17:05.658 --> 17:07.358
That was so good, Frank!

17:09.562 --> 17:10.461
>> Hey, you ready?

17:10.463 --> 17:11.496
>> Yeah, I'm ready.

17:11.498 --> 17:12.730
>> Frank did great.

17:12.732 --> 17:13.731
>> Frank?

17:13.733 --> 17:14.966
>> Yeah, uh, Dee passed out.

17:14.968 --> 17:16.167
>> She... of course she did.

17:16.169 --> 17:17.502
She's so embarrassing.

17:17.504 --> 17:19.237
>> Right.

17:19.239 --> 17:19.904
>> All right, here we go,

17:19.906 --> 17:20.571
everybody.

17:20.573 --> 17:21.339
We're gonna bring Dennis out

17:21.341 --> 17:22.373
right now.

17:22.375 --> 17:23.474
Here he is, Dennis Reynolds.

17:23.476 --> 17:24.475
Here we go.

17:24.477 --> 17:26.010
>> Yeah, Dennis.

17:26.012 --> 17:27.912
>> All right.

17:27.914 --> 17:29.013
Okay.

17:29.015 --> 17:31.682
Now, Dennis... Frank got the

17:31.684 --> 17:33.418
number one answer for every

17:33.420 --> 17:35.053
single question, so you only

17:35.055 --> 17:36.654
need five points to win the

17:36.656 --> 17:37.889
game. Okay?

17:37.891 --> 17:38.589
>> Okay, I can do it.

17:38.591 --> 17:39.357
Now, Grant, listen, I know I

17:39.359 --> 17:40.191
gave some bad answers before...

17:40.193 --> 17:41.042
>> Yes.

17:41.043 --> 17:41.892
>> ...but I understand the game

17:41.895 --> 17:43.394
perfectly now, and, uh, that

17:43.396 --> 17:44.395
does not represent me.

17:44.397 --> 17:45.096
>> Okay, I like that.

17:45.098 --> 17:45.830
>> Okay? So I'm ready to give

17:45.832 --> 17:46.364
good answers.

17:46.366 --> 17:47.031
>> I like that.

17:47.033 --> 17:47.765
>> That does represent me.

17:47.767 --> 17:48.533
>> All right, that sounds good,

17:48.535 --> 17:49.333
that sounds good.

17:49.335 --> 17:50.334
If you repeat any of Frank's

17:50.336 --> 17:51.202
answers, you're gonna hear this

17:51.204 --> 17:51.869
sound...

17:51.871 --> 17:52.670
(buzzer blares)

17:52.672 --> 17:53.704
...and then...

17:53.706 --> 17:54.572
>> Thought we were done with the

17:54.574 --> 17:55.490
buzzer.

17:55.491 --> 17:56.407
>> Only if you repeat an answer.

17:56.409 --> 17:57.175
>> Even in this round?

17:57.177 --> 17:58.209
>> Yes, even in this round. Yep.

17:58.211 --> 17:59.244
>> Mm-hmm.

17:59.245 --> 18:00.278
>> If you don't know an answer,

18:00.280 --> 18:01.846
you can say "pass" and we'll

18:01.848 --> 18:02.547
just move on to the next

18:02.549 --> 18:03.214
question.

18:03.216 --> 18:03.881
>> Okay.

18:03.883 --> 18:04.582
>> All right, are you ready?

18:04.584 --> 18:05.249
>> Yes, yes.

18:05.251 --> 18:07.251
>> 30 seconds on the clock.

18:07.253 --> 18:08.753
Name something you thought

18:08.755 --> 18:10.121
existed when you were a child.

18:10.123 --> 18:10.855
>> Santa Claus.

18:10.857 --> 18:11.522
(buzzer blares)

18:11.524 --> 18:13.091
Oh, God... uh, pass.

18:13.093 --> 18:14.092
>> Name something you might find

18:14.094 --> 18:15.193
in a bathtub.

18:15.195 --> 18:16.027
>> S... uh, soap.

18:16.029 --> 18:16.894
(buzzer blares)

18:16.896 --> 18:17.728
Ah! God, I really hate that

18:17.730 --> 18:18.396
buzzer.

18:18.398 --> 18:19.063
Can we not do that?

18:19.065 --> 18:19.897
>> Clock's ticking, clock's

18:19.899 --> 18:20.565
ticking.

18:20.567 --> 18:21.232
>> Okay, uh, pass.

18:21.234 --> 18:21.899
>> Name something people add

18:21.901 --> 18:23.768
sugar to.

18:23.770 --> 18:24.769
>> God... coffee.

18:24.771 --> 18:25.570
(buzzer blares)

18:25.572 --> 18:26.804
Oh, God...

18:26.806 --> 18:27.538
>> Nope, we gotta... we need

18:27.540 --> 18:28.323
an answer.

18:28.324 --> 18:29.107
>> Yeah, no, no, okay, no, then

18:29.109 --> 18:29.941
pass, then pass, 'cause...

18:29.943 --> 18:30.808
>> A thing you associate with

18:30.810 --> 18:31.776
Charlie Chaplin.

18:31.778 --> 18:32.777
>> Mmm... pass.

18:32.779 --> 18:34.212
>> Okay, name a foreign country

18:34.214 --> 18:35.246
whose films are popular in

18:35.248 --> 18:36.247
America.

18:36.249 --> 18:36.881
>> France.

18:36.883 --> 18:37.482
(buzzer blares)

18:37.484 --> 18:38.483
Oh, God, no, no!

18:38.485 --> 18:39.250
>> Already said that.

18:39.252 --> 18:39.917
>> Oh, God, France.

18:39.919 --> 18:40.585
(buzzer blares)

18:40.587 --> 18:41.369
France. France. France.

18:41.370 --> 18:42.152
>> That's still not the answer.

18:42.155 --> 18:43.121
>> Little mustache.

18:43.123 --> 18:43.821
Soap, soap, France.

18:43.823 --> 18:44.722
(buzzer blaring)

18:44.724 --> 18:45.490
>> Something else!

18:45.492 --> 18:46.824
>> It won't stop!

18:46.826 --> 18:47.758
>> He said that already.

18:47.760 --> 18:48.593
Don't say "France."

18:48.595 --> 18:49.594
>> Give up.

18:49.596 --> 18:50.345
(Dennis sobbing)

18:50.346 --> 18:51.095
>> All right, I have never seen

18:51.097 --> 18:52.296
a more embarrassing display in

18:52.298 --> 18:53.631
my entire career.

18:53.633 --> 18:55.233
>> Oh, please don't air this.

18:55.235 --> 18:56.434
Okay? Please don't... don't air

18:56.436 --> 18:57.235
this... you won't air this,

18:57.237 --> 18:58.169
right?

18:58.171 --> 18:58.936
>> Oh, no, no, we definitely air

18:58.938 --> 18:59.604
it.

18:59.606 --> 19:00.271
We always air it.

19:00.273 --> 19:01.005
No matter what, we air it.

19:01.006 --> 19:01.738
That's how we do it, my friend.

19:01.741 --> 19:02.406
>> It just went so wrong...

19:02.408 --> 19:03.090
>> Good night, everybody!

19:03.091 --> 19:03.773
Thanks for joining us here on

19:03.776 --> 19:04.442
<i> Family Fight!</i>

19:04.444 --> 19:05.360
Take care.

19:05.361 --> 19:06.277
(audience applauding, cheering)

19:06.279 --> 19:09.981
(Dennis sobbing)

19:09.983 --> 19:11.449
>> Why'd they have to air that

19:11.451 --> 19:12.450
part?

19:12.452 --> 19:13.484
>> That was the end part.

19:13.486 --> 19:14.652
>> The best part.

19:14.654 --> 19:15.586
>> Yeah, they air the whole

19:15.588 --> 19:16.587
show.

19:16.589 --> 19:18.589
(Dennis sobbing)

19:24.364 --> 19:25.363
>> This doesn't represent me,

19:25.365 --> 19:26.464
though.

19:26.466 --> 19:28.099
This doesn't represent me.

19:28.101 --> 19:29.467
That's not who I am.

19:29.469 --> 19:31.802
So just don't air it.

19:31.804 --> 19:33.804
It's the buzzer that was...

19:33.806 --> 19:36.507
That just doesn't represent me.

19:36.509 --> 19:38.509
So just don't air it!

20:14.747 --> 20:16.747
(trio chanting backwards)
