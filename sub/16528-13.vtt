00:00.001 --> 00:03.202
ADULT ADAM:<i> Back in the '80s,</i>
<i> me and my best friend</i>
<i> Chad Kremp</i>

00:03.204 --> 00:04.203
<i> were budding Spielbergs.</i>

00:04.205 --> 00:07.439
<i> We were so into making movies,</i>
<i> we even had our own company.</i>

00:07.441 --> 00:09.708
ADAM: Chadam Productions,
"Turtles," take one.

00:09.710 --> 00:12.845
<i> Yep, we'd been making movies</i>
<i> together since we were kids.</i>

00:12.847 --> 00:16.315
<i> Our dream was to grow up</i>
<i> and be famous filmmakers</i>
<i> together.</i>

00:16.317 --> 00:19.852
<i> Nothing would stop it,</i>
<i> or so I thought.</i>

00:19.854 --> 00:20.853
Sorry, dude.

00:20.855 --> 00:22.388
I can't make
a movie today.

00:22.390 --> 00:23.389
I got tennis practice,

00:23.391 --> 00:25.424
and then I'm going out
for burgers with Alicia.

00:25.426 --> 00:28.093
Come on, our home movies
always come first.

00:28.095 --> 00:31.363
You know the saying,
flicks before chicks!

00:31.499 --> 00:32.865
Sorry, bro.

00:32.867 --> 00:36.168
Oh, my poor sweetie.
I'll be in your little movie.

00:36.504 --> 00:37.870
No.
Stop right there.

00:37.872 --> 00:41.206
<i> ¶ Happy Birthday to you ¶</i>

00:41.208 --> 00:43.208
ADULT ADAM:
<i> Because I didn't want</i>
<i> this to be my life,</i>

00:43.210 --> 00:46.145
<i> I had to find a way</i>
<i> to get Chad back into movies.</i>

00:46.147 --> 00:48.614
Today we are seeing
the most important movie

00:48.616 --> 00:50.416
of our generation,
<i> Quicksilver.</i>

00:50.418 --> 00:52.117
Sorry, man.
I got tennis practice today.

00:52.119 --> 00:54.920
But it stars the
always reliable Kevin Bacon

00:54.922 --> 00:56.388
as a big-city
bike messenger

00:56.390 --> 00:58.490
who uses his wheels
and his wits to escape danger.

00:58.492 --> 01:00.292
That doesn't really sound
like my kind of thing.

01:00.294 --> 01:01.326
Of course
it's your thing!

01:01.328 --> 01:02.494
It's a hard-core
sports movie.

01:02.496 --> 01:04.963
Delivering mail by bicycle
is not a sport.

01:04.965 --> 01:06.331
Shut up, Dave Kim!

01:06.333 --> 01:07.299
Come on, Chad.

01:07.301 --> 01:09.101
The only reason
to see<i> Quicksilver</i>

01:09.103 --> 01:10.936
is to talk crap
about<i> Quicksilver</i>

01:10.938 --> 01:12.738
after you see
<i> Quicksilver.</i>

01:12.740 --> 01:13.639
I can't do it alone.

01:13.641 --> 01:15.441
Yo, guys,
you coming or what?

01:15.609 --> 01:16.341
(SIGHS)
Sorry, Ad Rock.

01:16.343 --> 01:18.744
ADULT ADAM:
<i> In that moment, I realized</i>
<i> there was only one way</i>

01:18.746 --> 01:22.648
<i> to reunite with my best</i>
<i> friend, do the unthinkable.</i>

01:22.650 --> 01:25.384
All right, everyone,
meet your new teammate.

01:25.386 --> 01:26.485
Kid's got
zero experience,

01:26.487 --> 01:29.154
but he makes up for it
by showing up.

01:29.156 --> 01:30.222
Hi! I'm Adam.

01:30.224 --> 01:31.523
Pumped to play
some tennis,

01:31.525 --> 01:33.659
but I hear
it's a real "racquet."

01:33.661 --> 01:35.394
Yeah, that's what
I bring to the table.

01:35.396 --> 01:37.896
Ah, yikes,
off to a rough start.

01:37.898 --> 01:39.798
All right.
(WHISTLE BLOWS)

01:39.800 --> 01:41.200
<i> ¶ I'm twisted up inside</i>

01:41.202 --> 01:45.270
<i> ¶ But nonetheless</i>
<i> I feel the need to say</i>

01:47.274 --> 01:48.474
<i> ¶ I don't know the future</i>

01:48.476 --> 01:52.778
<i> ¶ But the past keeps getting</i>
<i> clearer every day ¶</i>

01:52.947 --> 01:55.347
ADULT ADAM:
<i> It was Valentine's Day,</i>
<i> 1980-something,</i>

01:55.349 --> 01:58.317
<i> and everywhere you looked,</i>
<i> love was in the air.</i>

01:58.319 --> 01:59.151
Check it out.

01:59.153 --> 02:00.586
I robbed a bank
for you, baby.

02:00.588 --> 02:02.387
(GASPS)
I love it.

02:02.389 --> 02:05.090
I'm so sorry
I haven't stolen
anything for you yet.

02:05.092 --> 02:07.693
ADULT ADAM:<i> It was a day</i>
<i> for teenage romance.</i>

02:08.062 --> 02:09.661
<i> Unless you were my sister.</i>

02:09.663 --> 02:13.465
You stupid sheep are slaves
to this corporate holiday!

02:13.467 --> 02:15.767
Ha! But not this girl.

02:15.769 --> 02:17.369
I walk alone.

02:17.938 --> 02:18.437
So completely alone.

02:18.439 --> 02:21.940
ADULT ADAM:
<i> She had given up on love after</i>
<i> losing out on Geoff Schwartz.</i>

02:21.942 --> 02:22.741
Hey, sweetie.

02:22.743 --> 02:24.076
(CHUCKLES)
How are things?

02:24.078 --> 02:25.244
(SCOFFS) So good.

02:25.246 --> 02:27.613
Do you have any ranch dressing
I can pour into this chip bag?

02:27.615 --> 02:28.714
Like, on me,
in the hallway?

02:28.716 --> 02:29.948
Just give me
the ranch dressing!

02:29.950 --> 02:30.582
I don't have
ranch dressing!

02:30.584 --> 02:34.119
Look, you can't get
so depressed over
Valentine's Day, okay?

02:34.121 --> 02:36.054
I mean, Barry hasn't
gotten me anything,

02:36.056 --> 02:37.322
and I couldn't care less.

02:37.324 --> 02:38.524
Dear God, I see puppies!

02:38.526 --> 02:43.562
Lady Lewis,
how I feel about you
is more than puppy love.

02:43.564 --> 02:45.164
I doggone adore you.

02:45.166 --> 02:47.499
I recognize
this is bad timing.

02:47.735 --> 02:48.033
Aww. Mm!

02:48.035 --> 02:50.569
I'm actually jealous
of my brother and
his girlfriend.

02:50.571 --> 02:51.670
This is a new low.

02:51.672 --> 02:53.105
Hey, Erica.
Geoff!

02:53.107 --> 02:55.340
Wow. This is
so thoughtful.

02:55.342 --> 02:56.675
He really is.

02:56.677 --> 02:57.609
Aren't I the luckiest?

02:57.611 --> 02:59.945
Yes, you are,
'cause you're dating,

02:59.947 --> 03:01.947
so obviously the
wonderful bear is for you

03:01.949 --> 03:04.049
'cause that makes
too much sense,

03:04.051 --> 03:05.484
and they're gone.

03:05.586 --> 03:06.652
Who has ranch?

03:06.654 --> 03:07.719
Okay, we need to
help that girl.

03:07.721 --> 03:11.156
This sounds like a job
for the bodacious
guidance counselor

03:11.158 --> 03:13.025
that all the kids
adore and respect.

03:13.027 --> 03:15.060
First of all, your constant
lurking is really jarring.

03:15.062 --> 03:16.161
Can't a guy stand
around teenagers,

03:16.163 --> 03:19.198
waiting for some juicy gossip
without being judged?

03:19.200 --> 03:20.065
No. And secondly,

03:20.067 --> 03:22.167
I don't think Erica
will listen to any of us.

03:22.169 --> 03:23.302
Oh, don't worry.

03:23.304 --> 03:25.304
Old Glascott
is a professional

03:25.306 --> 03:27.139
and knows exactly
how to handle this.

03:27.141 --> 03:27.973
Right this way, Erica.

03:27.975 --> 03:30.142
The make-your-own-s'mores
buffet is in here.

03:30.144 --> 03:31.476
ERICA:
Oh, God, what is this?

03:31.478 --> 03:34.213
There's no
make-your-own-s'mores buffet.

03:34.215 --> 03:35.681
I lied.
(CHUCKLES)

03:35.683 --> 03:37.216
Have a seat.

03:37.218 --> 03:39.051
Okay, what the hell
is going on?

03:39.053 --> 03:40.919
This is called
an intervention.

03:40.921 --> 03:43.121
It's a new craze
sweeping the nation.

03:43.123 --> 03:44.656
I read a pamphlet
and everything.

03:44.658 --> 03:46.692
I've been intervening
in her life for years.

03:46.694 --> 03:49.228
It's so exciting
to finally do it
in a professional setting.

03:49.230 --> 03:52.764
We've all come together
to say that we want
the old Erica back.

03:52.766 --> 03:55.234
Yeah, we want the Erica
from the last three years.

03:55.236 --> 03:57.069
You know, you were
so confident and talented.

03:57.071 --> 04:00.105
But this year, you're weak
and sad and boy-crazy.

04:00.107 --> 04:01.840
Thank you for
that honest assessment,

04:01.842 --> 04:03.342
Barry's interchangeable
friends.

04:03.344 --> 04:04.142
Ouch.
I know. I get it.

04:04.144 --> 04:06.144
Look, Erica,
these boys care about you.

04:06.146 --> 04:09.081
We all do, which is why
we wrote letters

04:09.083 --> 04:11.917
to make this easier to say.
I'll start.

04:12.186 --> 04:15.721
"Dearest Erica,
I miss your singing."

04:16.223 --> 04:18.390
That's it?
Yeah, I don't
really know her.

04:18.392 --> 04:21.093
Look, I manage
600 kids, okay?

04:21.095 --> 04:22.361
You're up next,
big fella.

04:22.363 --> 04:25.697
Erica, I was at work
when your mom called me,

04:25.699 --> 04:28.200
and I fought through traffic
to get here,

04:28.202 --> 04:31.870
and what I'm really trying
to say is, what is this?

04:31.872 --> 04:32.671
Oh, Murray,
you're not helping.

04:32.673 --> 04:35.874
I know I'm not helping because
I don't know what this is.

04:35.876 --> 04:37.476
What your father
is trying to say

04:37.478 --> 04:41.780
is we want the old Erica back,
the one who'd fight with me

04:41.782 --> 04:43.982
and sneak out
and steal my credit card

04:43.984 --> 04:46.551
and buy wine coolers
and blame it on a hobo

04:46.553 --> 04:47.552
who lived in our walls.

04:47.554 --> 04:50.088
I miss your fire
and your passion.

04:50.090 --> 04:51.490
We all do.

04:51.492 --> 04:52.724
So, what do you say?

04:52.726 --> 04:54.926
I say...pbht!

04:54.928 --> 04:56.628
Later, turds.

04:56.797 --> 04:58.230
(SIGHS)

04:58.232 --> 05:00.932
Well, my first intervention
was a bust.

05:00.934 --> 05:03.268
Well, we tried
your dumb thing, Andre.

05:03.270 --> 05:07.072
Looks like the only person
who can fix Erica is me.

05:07.074 --> 05:07.873
Oh, God, no.

05:07.875 --> 05:08.807
This is bad.
Don't do that.

05:08.809 --> 05:10.742
Why am I here?
Well, that settles it.

05:10.744 --> 05:13.712
It's time for the mother
of all interventions.

05:13.714 --> 05:14.746
A "mothervention"!

05:14.748 --> 05:16.648
Damn it,
that's good wordplay.

05:16.650 --> 05:18.317
Okay, she's got
to get involved now.

05:18.319 --> 05:19.518
Is this done yet?
Can we go?

05:19.520 --> 05:22.587
ADULT ADAM:<i> My mom was</i>
<i> dead set on bringing Erica</i>
<i> back to her old self.</i>

05:22.589 --> 05:26.224
<i> Meanwhile,</i>
<i> I was ready to bring back</i>
<i> Chadam in a big way.</i>

05:26.226 --> 05:27.125
This is gonna be awesome.

05:27.127 --> 05:29.194
Yeah, uh, since when
do you play tennis?

05:29.196 --> 05:30.462
I don't.
Good news is,

05:30.464 --> 05:32.397
you can teach me
when we're doubles partners.

05:32.399 --> 05:35.067
Wait. What?
Chadam's back, baby!

05:35.069 --> 05:36.201
Aah!

05:36.203 --> 05:36.468
Oh!

05:36.470 --> 05:39.404
Sorry, I've never been
this close to sports before,

05:39.406 --> 05:40.305
but it's gonna be fun.

05:40.307 --> 05:41.406
ADULT ADAM:
<i> Except it wasn't.</i>

05:41.408 --> 05:44.242
<i> It turns out</i>
<i> tennis is super hard.</i>

05:44.244 --> 05:45.610
Do over!

05:45.612 --> 05:47.479
Sun was in my eye.

05:47.481 --> 05:49.848
Can you hit the ball slower?

05:49.850 --> 05:51.850
Oh, hold on,
my shorts are riding up.

05:51.852 --> 05:53.051
Wait!
My glasses are fogged!

05:53.053 --> 05:54.886
I'm really good
at Nintendo tennis.

05:54.888 --> 05:56.221
ADULT ADAM:
<i> As I fell apart on the court,</i>

05:56.223 --> 05:58.857
<i> my mom had the perfect way</i>
<i> to cheer up Erica.</i>

05:58.859 --> 06:00.525
What have you
dragged me to?

06:00.527 --> 06:01.760
What is this place?

06:01.762 --> 06:04.763
Only the happiest place
in the world.

06:04.765 --> 06:06.198
The Disco!

06:06.533 --> 06:08.433
This place is sadder
than I am.

06:08.435 --> 06:09.735
Oh, it's just early.

06:09.737 --> 06:11.636
Listen,
back before I realized

06:11.638 --> 06:13.939
that my ultimate joy
was having babies,

06:13.941 --> 06:16.041
my gal pals and I
had a place we'd go

06:16.043 --> 06:17.709
where we would just
groove the night away.

06:17.711 --> 06:22.047
It was packed with people
just having the time
of their lives.

06:22.049 --> 06:23.949
Mom, look around.

06:23.951 --> 06:25.317
Disco is dead.

06:25.319 --> 06:25.650
Oh, poop.

06:25.652 --> 06:29.921
I think I would've heard
if a whole genre of music
had died.

06:29.923 --> 06:31.189
(LAUGHS)
Excuse me, sir.

06:31.191 --> 06:34.025
What time does this place
explode into a disco inferno?

06:34.027 --> 06:36.828
When all the two-faced
schmucks of this world admit

06:36.830 --> 06:39.431
that it's the music
that shaped America!

06:39.433 --> 06:40.732
I think that's jazz.

06:40.734 --> 06:41.800
It's disco, fool!

06:41.802 --> 06:43.402
The Angry Weirdo is right.

06:43.404 --> 06:44.836
Time to boogie
the night away.

06:44.838 --> 06:46.071
ADULT ADAM:
<i> And boogie she did.</i>

06:46.073 --> 06:49.274
<i> What happened next</i>
<i> was a Beverly Goldberg</i>
<i> disco inferno.</i>

06:49.276 --> 06:52.811
<i> She burned up the dance floor</i>
<i> with the funky chicken</i>

06:52.813 --> 06:54.479
<i> and also this...</i>

06:54.481 --> 06:55.580
<i> and that...</i>

06:55.582 --> 06:56.748
<i> and whatever this move is.</i>

06:56.750 --> 06:58.650
<i> I think it's called</i>
<i> the Embarrassing Mom.</i>

06:58.652 --> 07:01.453
<i> Whatever it's called,</i>
(CHUCKLING)<i> it was bad...</i>

07:01.455 --> 07:03.121
<i> really bad.</i>

07:03.123 --> 07:05.123
Come on, just dance
for one minute.

07:05.125 --> 07:06.425
You'll forget
all your worries

07:06.427 --> 07:08.527
and be happy normal,
happy Erica again.

07:08.529 --> 07:09.494
If I disco for one second,

07:09.496 --> 07:11.963
then can we leave
this glittery hellscape?

07:11.965 --> 07:12.230
Deal.

07:12.232 --> 07:14.533
ADULT ADAM:
<i> But despite it all,</i>
<i> my mom was right.</i>

07:14.535 --> 07:15.901
Whee!
<i> It took a little convincing,</i>

07:15.903 --> 07:17.536
<i> but once Erica</i>
<i> was on the floor,</i>

07:17.538 --> 07:19.671
<i> the music took care</i>
<i> of the rest.</i>
Whoo!

07:19.673 --> 07:20.605
BARTENDER: Yes!

07:20.607 --> 07:21.273
<i> For half a hustle.</i>
Boom!

07:21.275 --> 07:25.544
Oh, my God!
Are you disco-dancing with
a teacher on Valentine's Day?

07:25.546 --> 07:26.945
What? No.
She's my mom.

07:26.947 --> 07:27.612
That's even sadder.

07:27.614 --> 07:29.481
Hey, you guys are
at this lame place, too.

07:29.483 --> 07:32.250
Uh, that's only
'cause they sell
cheap beer to minors.

07:32.252 --> 07:33.285
Whoa,
are you guys underage?

07:33.287 --> 07:36.888
Nope, I'm 27 according to my
commercial trucking license.

07:36.890 --> 07:37.656
Don't look
at the picture.

07:37.658 --> 07:39.724
I lost a bunch of weight
and got less Asian.

07:39.726 --> 07:40.792
We're cool.
Hey, kids.

07:40.794 --> 07:44.596
Why don't you quit yer yappin'
and take a trip to Funkytown?

07:45.732 --> 07:47.165
Would you stop that?

07:47.167 --> 07:49.000
I can't.
I'm all funked up.

07:49.002 --> 07:51.336
ADULT ADAM:
<i> While my sister tried</i>
<i> to escape my mom,</i>

07:51.338 --> 07:54.873
<i> I was ready for some</i>
<i> quality time with my bestie.</i>

07:54.875 --> 07:57.576
Tennis, man,
you know, tennis.

07:57.578 --> 07:58.243
Yeah.

07:58.245 --> 08:00.045
And the best part,
this thing.

08:00.047 --> 08:01.513
It's like Pac-Man.

08:01.515 --> 08:03.782
Wakka.
Wakka-wakka-wakka.

08:03.784 --> 08:05.984
Adam.
Adam, please.

08:06.787 --> 08:08.587
Listen, I'm thinking...

08:08.589 --> 08:11.389
we shouldn't be
doubles partners anymore.

08:12.759 --> 08:13.725
Oh, wow.

08:13.727 --> 08:15.260
This...
This is unexpected.

08:15.262 --> 08:17.362
Is it me?
No. It's, it's me.

08:17.364 --> 08:18.864
I can do better.
I can change.

08:18.866 --> 08:19.831
I don't want you
to change.

08:19.833 --> 08:22.801
Just tell me the kind
of partner you want me to be,

08:22.803 --> 08:23.635
and I'll just be it.

08:23.637 --> 08:26.037
I just need a break
from doubles. All right?

08:26.039 --> 08:28.340
I, I need to focus
on being single
for a while.

08:28.342 --> 08:31.343
Okay, I don't want
to force being partners.

08:31.345 --> 08:34.579
But when you're ready,
I'll be here waiting.

08:35.883 --> 08:38.884
Chad is doubles partners
with Dave Kim?

08:39.586 --> 08:41.786
That is not
single behavior.

08:42.656 --> 08:43.655
Coach Mellor!

08:43.657 --> 08:46.258
Please tell me you forced Chad
to be partners with Dave Kim.

08:46.260 --> 08:49.594
Quite the opposite, Goldfarb.
Chad came to me.

08:49.596 --> 08:51.229
Made me swear to keep
it a secret, too.

08:51.231 --> 08:54.232
Something about feelings
and friendship, I don't know.

08:54.234 --> 08:56.902
I'm not your remembering
things secretary, Chad Kremp!

08:56.904 --> 08:59.471
That snake is cheating on me
with my mortal enemy,

08:59.473 --> 09:02.340
who is actually a great guy
and another friend.

09:02.342 --> 09:03.141
I sympathize.

09:03.143 --> 09:05.410
Tennis is a lot
like marriage.

09:05.412 --> 09:06.878
It's long, and it's boring,

09:06.880 --> 09:10.181
and eventually, she leaves you
for a handsome Latin man

09:10.183 --> 09:12.851
who was just supposed
to re-tile your bathroom.

09:12.853 --> 09:14.152
Well, there's only
one thing left to do.

09:14.154 --> 09:18.023
I become the
best tennis player
this school has ever known,

09:18.025 --> 09:20.258
and I need your help
to do it.

09:20.260 --> 09:21.493
Damn it, Goldfarb.

09:21.495 --> 09:22.928
As a coach,
I took a blood oath

09:22.930 --> 09:24.429
never to let
a student-athlete fail

09:24.431 --> 09:25.730
if he's got drive
and desire,

09:25.732 --> 09:28.567
which is exactly why I'm gonna
get into my Ford Festiva

09:28.569 --> 09:30.802
and pretend
you never asked.

09:30.804 --> 09:33.538
I will be top seed!
I'll show you!

09:33.540 --> 09:37.042
I'll show Chad.
I'll show everyone!

09:37.044 --> 09:38.944
Come on!

09:39.413 --> 09:41.680
That almost bonked me
in my shin.

09:41.682 --> 09:43.848
Not cool, guys!

09:45.519 --> 09:48.119
ADULT ADAM:
<i> It had been one day</i>
<i> since the disco disaster,</i>

09:48.121 --> 09:52.657
<i> and all Erica wanted to do</i>
<i> was hide from everyone</i>
<i> in a dark theater.</i>

09:53.460 --> 09:54.759
<i> Or not.</i>

09:54.761 --> 09:56.461
Erica?

09:56.463 --> 09:57.963
Six, seven...

09:57.965 --> 10:01.333
Yeah, that should be
enough seats
for all my friends.

10:01.335 --> 10:02.300
Oh, Geoff and Evy?

10:02.302 --> 10:04.202
You're here seeing
<i> Quicksilver?</i> Me too!

10:04.204 --> 10:07.272
I'm just waiting for Lainey
and the rest of the gang.

10:07.274 --> 10:09.274
Cool.
Fine!
I'm all alone!

10:09.276 --> 10:11.943
I'm hiding out watching
a crappy Kevin Bacon movie

10:11.945 --> 10:13.645
about bicycles
all by myself.

10:13.647 --> 10:14.012
Are you okay?

10:14.014 --> 10:16.648
This is the second time I've
seen this movie today, so, no.

10:16.650 --> 10:18.717
Geoffrey, why don't
you run and get Erica

10:18.719 --> 10:20.819
one of those
extra large KitKats?

10:20.821 --> 10:21.753
I've noticed
sweet treats

10:21.755 --> 10:24.889
have been the one friend
she can count on this week.

10:24.891 --> 10:27.225
Geoff to the rescue!

10:27.561 --> 10:29.394
Well, well.

10:29.529 --> 10:31.296
Who knew I'd spend
Valentine's Day

10:31.298 --> 10:33.465
with the woman who tried
to snake my man?

10:33.467 --> 10:36.134
Yeah, I'm sure this is
a great moment for you.

10:36.136 --> 10:37.202
Honestly, it's not.

10:37.204 --> 10:41.072
I mean, I should
be gloating, but...

10:41.074 --> 10:42.974
you're very sad.

10:42.976 --> 10:44.709
It just makes me
want to hug you.

10:44.711 --> 10:46.177
Oh, God, no!
Don't hug me!

10:46.179 --> 10:48.680
We're enemies.
You're supposed to fear me.

10:48.682 --> 10:51.082
Sweetie, not anymore.

10:51.418 --> 10:52.884
Now I just want you
to be okay.

10:52.886 --> 10:55.153
ADULT ADAM:
<i> Evy's pity was the last straw.</i>

10:55.155 --> 10:55.920
<i> In that moment...</i>

10:55.922 --> 10:57.322
(HORN HONKS, TIRES SCREECH)
<i> ...my sister knew</i>

10:57.324 --> 10:59.557

<i> on the bike again.</i>

10:59.559 --> 11:01.893

<i> and two hours of crimping,</i>

Oh, there she is!

11:11.004 --> 11:12.871
My beautiful baby is back!

11:12.873 --> 11:15.607
Back from where?
How much did it cost me?

11:15.609 --> 11:16.741
Murray, pay attention.

11:16.743 --> 11:18.309
What, were you
at dance camp?

11:18.311 --> 11:20.045
Something to do
with music?

11:20.047 --> 11:21.079
I know it hits me
in the pocket.

11:21.081 --> 11:25.150
Let's just say that I finally
decided to make a change.

11:25.152 --> 11:26.451
See? I told you.

11:26.453 --> 11:28.853
A little disco
can solve anything.

11:28.855 --> 11:30.288
(CHUCKLES)
Thanks, Mom.

11:30.290 --> 11:32.290
You really are a great...
Oh, bup, bup, bup!

11:32.292 --> 11:34.325
Don't pull away.
I'm still hugging you.

11:34.327 --> 11:35.393
Oh.
(BOTH CHUCKLE)

11:35.395 --> 11:38.863
Oh, I'm so glad I was able
to help you with your
big comeback.

11:38.865 --> 11:39.731
More than
you will ever know.

11:39.733 --> 11:41.700
ADULT ADAM:
<i> As my sister</i>
<i> was returning to form,</i>

11:41.702 --> 11:44.769
<i> I turned to</i>
<i> the greatest athlete I knew.</i>

11:44.771 --> 11:45.170
<i> My brother.</i>

11:45.172 --> 11:49.207
Barry, my handsome
and powerful brother,
I need your help.

11:49.209 --> 11:51.076
Normally I'd punch you
and walk away,

11:51.078 --> 11:52.944
but I gotta say,
I'm intrigued.

11:52.946 --> 11:55.380
I joined the tennis team,
and I need a doubles partner.

11:55.382 --> 11:56.147
Becoming bored!

11:56.149 --> 11:58.483
And I need your
incredible gifts.

11:58.485 --> 11:59.317
Listening again.

11:59.319 --> 12:00.618
Since you dominated
all sports,

12:00.620 --> 12:02.454
I was wondering
if you'd help me seek revenge

12:02.456 --> 12:04.389
on my best friend
on the tennis court.

12:04.391 --> 12:05.323
Well, you're in luck

12:05.325 --> 12:08.293
'cause I know everything
there is about tennis

12:08.295 --> 12:10.095
because of the coolest player
on the planet.

12:10.097 --> 12:13.598
ADULT ADAM:
<i> He was talking about</i>
<i> an '80s neon-clad tennis God</i>

12:13.600 --> 12:16.801
<i> who dominated the court</i>
<i> with monster serves and style.</i>

12:16.803 --> 12:19.104
Behold Andre Agassi!

12:19.106 --> 12:21.740
The greatest player
in the world.
You know why?

12:21.742 --> 12:23.208
Skill?
Partly.

12:23.210 --> 12:24.042
But the other part?

12:24.044 --> 12:28.146
A deadly combination
of splash, flash, and mullet!

12:28.148 --> 12:29.080
A mullet can do that?

12:29.082 --> 12:31.549
A mullet
doesn't have a boss!

12:31.551 --> 12:33.351
It takes no orders!

12:33.353 --> 12:35.220
It's above the law!

12:35.222 --> 12:36.154
Like Steven Seagal!

12:36.156 --> 12:36.755
But Seagal has a ponytail.

12:36.757 --> 12:39.457
Which is just a fancy mullet
tied with a rubber band.

12:39.459 --> 12:40.792
Why aren't you writing
any of this down?

12:40.794 --> 12:42.227
I really don't want
to put this to paper.

12:42.229 --> 12:44.395
I just want you
to teach me some tennis.

12:44.397 --> 12:45.430
As I will.

12:45.432 --> 12:47.632
I'm basically
Andre Agassi's twin.

12:47.634 --> 12:48.500
I even got the hair.

12:48.502 --> 12:50.135
You definitely
don't have the hair.

12:50.137 --> 12:50.935
Don't I?

12:50.937 --> 12:51.970
Was that just
lying around?

12:51.972 --> 12:53.338
Lainey likes when
I wear it sometimes.

12:53.340 --> 12:55.340
Don't, don't ask.
Wasn't going to.

12:55.342 --> 12:55.907
To the backyard!

12:55.909 --> 12:59.110
Where I will hit balls at you
as you run for your life.

12:59.112 --> 13:00.879
Move, move!

13:01.915 --> 13:04.115
You stole my credit card
to pay for a party?

13:04.117 --> 13:05.717
No idea what
you're talking about.

13:05.719 --> 13:06.518
Uh, hello?

13:06.520 --> 13:08.720
"Erica Goldberg's
Valentine's Day

13:08.722 --> 13:10.221
"Disco is Dead Party!"

13:10.223 --> 13:10.955
Your name is right there.

13:10.957 --> 13:13.224
Oh, that's the other
Erica Goldberg in school.

13:13.226 --> 13:14.125
I'm Erica F. Goldberg.

13:14.127 --> 13:15.860
No, that's Adam's
stupid thing!

13:15.862 --> 13:17.495
And nobody cares
about his dumb feud

13:17.497 --> 13:18.563
with the other Adam,
anyway.

13:18.565 --> 13:20.899
Mom, I swear.
Look me in the eyes.

13:20.901 --> 13:22.100
I would never lie to you.

13:22.102 --> 13:23.568
There's the girl
of the hour.

13:23.570 --> 13:25.069
I'm RSVP-ing plus eight.

13:25.071 --> 13:26.304
I'm bringing
my stepbrother.

13:26.306 --> 13:27.772
We just got him back
from this cult.

13:27.774 --> 13:28.640
He's so weird and cool.

13:28.642 --> 13:30.542
Bro, everyone's welcome
at my party.

13:30.544 --> 13:32.043
I am so angry
you don't trust me.

13:32.045 --> 13:36.281
Okay, there is no world
in which I am going
to allow you

13:36.283 --> 13:39.951
to mock disco and throw
an underage booze party.

13:39.953 --> 13:42.153
Hey, you wanted
the old Erica back,

13:42.155 --> 13:43.121
the one who would
fight you

13:43.123 --> 13:44.923
and sneak out and steal
your credit card.

13:44.925 --> 13:46.891
Okay, yes, those were
my words exactly.

13:46.893 --> 13:47.859
But I was wrong.

13:47.861 --> 13:48.927
Well, it's too late now.

13:48.929 --> 13:51.462
I'm back,
and there's no stopping me.

13:51.464 --> 13:52.530
Credit card's canceled.

13:52.532 --> 13:53.698
What? No way!
Run it again!

13:53.700 --> 13:57.101
Believe me,
nobody wants this
more than me.

13:57.103 --> 14:00.905
You actually gave me hope
that disco was coming back.

14:00.907 --> 14:02.540
But we both know
it's not.

14:02.542 --> 14:04.843
Please, don't send me
back to rock bottom.

14:04.845 --> 14:05.810
I posted flyers everywhere!

14:05.812 --> 14:08.446
Every kid from my high school
will be here tonight.

14:08.448 --> 14:08.913
High school?

14:08.915 --> 14:12.317
I mean my dental office in
a big adult building downtown?

14:12.319 --> 14:14.619
Get out.
Here I go.

14:14.621 --> 14:15.286
(SIGHS)

14:15.288 --> 14:17.555
All right, everybody,
I want you to join me

14:17.557 --> 14:19.924
in welcoming another Goldberg
to the team.

14:19.926 --> 14:21.192
We're all very excited
to have you here

14:21.194 --> 14:23.528
and also wondering
what the hell you're wearing.

14:23.530 --> 14:25.530
The style of champions.

14:25.532 --> 14:27.298
As my first order
of business,

14:27.300 --> 14:30.468
I challenge Kremp n' Kim
for top seed doubles!

14:30.470 --> 14:32.537
(LAUGHING) What?
You heard Big Tasty.

14:32.539 --> 14:34.505
Prepare to get Agassi'd,
sucka.

14:34.507 --> 14:36.274
Sha-blammy!
Coming in hot!

14:36.276 --> 14:37.842
Finally got some action
around here.

14:37.844 --> 14:38.710
You know it, Coach.

14:38.712 --> 14:40.478
Time for me
to rock 'n' roll.

<i> The only thing he didn't have</i>
<i> was the actual ability.</i>

14:56.730 --> 14:57.862
Question.

14:57.864 --> 14:58.429
Do we get extra points

14:58.431 --> 15:00.899
for hitting the ball over
the administration building?

15:00.901 --> 15:01.933
No, you do not.

15:01.935 --> 15:04.002
Dude, you promised
we would win.

15:04.004 --> 15:05.670
The Nike commercials lied!

15:05.672 --> 15:07.705
Tennis is surprisingly
difficult!
