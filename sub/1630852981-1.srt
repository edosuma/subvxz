711
00:50:44,922 --> 00:50:45,965
<i>Hey.</i>

712
00:50:46,549 --> 00:50:47,633
Hey.

713
00:50:48,801 --> 00:50:51,971
Been a long time
since I seen you down here.

714
00:50:53,264 --> 00:50:54,473
How you been?

715
00:50:56,809 --> 00:50:58,519
Yeah, I've been okay.

716
00:50:59,854 --> 00:51:01,230
<i>I was just...</i>

717
00:51:03,274 --> 00:51:05,109
I was just headed back upstairs.

718
00:51:05,860 --> 00:51:06,861
Well...

719
00:51:07,945 --> 00:51:09,613
<i>don't be a stranger.</i>

720
00:51:23,711 --> 00:51:26,088
- You know Carmine Falcone.
- I told you it's a mob spot.

721
00:51:26,172 --> 00:51:27,757
You didn't tell me
you had a relationship with him.

722

<i>I don't have
a relationship with him, okay?</i>

723
00:51:29,717 --> 00:51:31,552
- Well, that's not what it looked like.
- <i>Forget it.</i>

724
00:51:31,635 --> 00:51:32,720

[Gil] Hey!

731
00:51:47,485 --> 00:51:48,569
I lost you in there.

732
00:51:48,652 --> 00:51:49,737
Yeah, I gotta go.

733

00:52:04,126 --> 00:52:05,544
I hope, uh...

739
00:52:10,132 --> 00:52:11,550

[Batman] What do you know about

759
00:54:41,367 --> 00:54:43,661
a confidential informant
in the Maroni case?

760
00:54:46,747 --> 00:54:48,457
Yeah, sure, there was.

761
00:54:49,166 --> 00:54:51,001
That's the rat we're looking for.

762
00:54:51,919 --> 00:54:53,796
Somehow Riddler knows who he is.

763
00:54:54,380 --> 00:54:57,383
If we find the rat,
maybe it'll lead us to him.

764
00:54:57,466 --> 00:54:58,926
Where are you getting this?

765
00:54:59,009 --> 00:55:01,887
I have a source
who spoke to the DA tonight.

766
00:55:02,680 --> 00:55:04,140
Gil's very nervous.

767
00:55:05,099 --> 00:55:07,643
I think the killer's targeting
people close to that case.

768
00:55:07,726 --> 00:55:09,603
I worked that case.

769
00:55:09,687 --> 00:55:11,647
Riddler's not after you.

770
00:55:11,730 --> 00:55:12,648
How do you know?

771
00:55:13,023 --> 00:55:14,442
You're not corrupt.

772
00:55:15,484 --> 00:55:17,027
Colson's dirty?

773
00:55:22,908 --> 00:55:24,410
Maybe I, uh...

774
00:55:25,077 --> 00:55:28,414
I go after him.
Lean on him to give up the rat.

775
00:55:28,497 --> 00:55:31,792
It's too dangerous.
They made a secret deal with this guy.

776
00:55:32,543 --> 00:55:34,336
Who knows how many people it touches.

777
00:55:34,420 --> 00:55:37,631
Politicians. Police. The courts.

778
00:55:38,924 --> 00:55:40,634
It could tear the whole city apart.

779
00:55:41,051 --> 00:55:43,095
[Gordon] Jesus, this is a powder keg.

780
00:55:44,722 --> 00:55:46,474

- [Alfred] Pretty.

794
00:56:08,037 --> 00:56:09,413
She a new friend of yours?

795
00:56:14,001 --> 00:56:15,211
I'm not so sure.

796
00:56:16,045 --> 00:56:17,546
Looks like you upset her.

797
00:56:18,714 --> 00:56:20,841
Shall I take this as a good sign?

798
00:56:20,925 --> 00:56:21,926
What?

799
00:56:22,009 --> 00:56:22,927
Your attire.

800
00:56:23,010 --> 00:56:25,137
Is Bruce Wayne making
an actual appearance?

801
00:56:25,221 --> 00:56:27,223
There's a public memorial
for Mayor Mitchell.

802
00:56:27,306 --> 00:56:29,975
Serial killers like to
follow reactions to their crimes.

803
00:56:31,018 --> 00:56:32,603
Riddler might not be able to resist.

804
00:56:32,686 --> 00:56:34,146
Oh, that reminds me.

805
00:56:35,314 --> 00:56:39,276
I've taken the liberty of doing
a little work on this latest cipher.

806
00:56:39,819 --> 00:56:41,320
The one from the rat maze.

807
00:56:41,737 --> 00:56:44,824
I'm afraid his Spanish is not perfect,

808
00:56:45,157 --> 00:56:47,034
but I'm fairly certain
this translates to,

809
00:56:47,118 --> 00:56:50,371
"You are <i>El Rata Alada."</i>

810
00:56:50,996 --> 00:56:52,415
[Bruce] <i>Rata Alada?</i>

811
00:56:52,498 --> 00:56:53,707
"Rat with wings"?

812
00:56:53,791 --> 00:56:56,293
It's slang for "pigeon."
Does that mean anything to you?

813
00:56:56,377 --> 00:56:57,628
Yeah.

814
00:56:59,088 --> 00:57:00,214
A stool pigeon.

815
00:57:00,464 --> 00:57:02,091
Where are your cufflinks?

816
00:57:02,174 --> 00:57:03,134
I couldn't find them.

817
00:57:04,593 --> 00:57:06,554
Well, you can't go out like that.

818
00:57:06,637 --> 00:57:08,431
Alfred, I don't want your cufflinks.

819
00:57:12,601 --> 00:57:15,396

You're still a Wayne.

Give us a wide berth here,
would you, slick?

Hey, watch it, fellas.

841
00:59:11,429 --> 00:59:13,722
You got the prince of the city there.

Some event, huh?

843
00:59:18,477 --> 00:59:21,439
Brought out the one guy in the city
more reclusive than me.

00:59:21,522 --> 00:59:23,983
Thought you'd never leave the Shoreline.

845
00:59:24,066 --> 00:59:25,693
Aren't you afraid
someone'll take a shot at you?

846
00:59:25,776 --> 00:59:27,778
Why? 'Cause your father ain't around?

847
00:59:28,654 --> 00:59:30,072
Oz, you know Bruce Wayne?

848
00:59:30,698 --> 00:59:32,158
Wow. Is that right?

849
00:59:32,241 --> 00:59:34,285
His father saved my life.

850
00:59:35,244 --> 00:59:38,456
I got shot in the chest. Right here.

851
00:59:39,665 --> 00:59:43,169
I couldn't go to no hospital,
so we showed up on his doorstep.

852

Operated right on the dining room table.

853
00:59:46,756 --> 00:59:52,011
Kid here, he saw the whole thing,
up on the stairs looking down.

I remember your face.

855
00:59:57,433 --> 00:59:59,393
You don't think that meant something,
he did that?

856
00:59:59,769 --> 01:00:01,896
It meant he took the Hippocratic oath.

857
01:00:03,230 --> 01:00:04,815
"Hippocratic oath."

858
01:00:07,359 --> 01:00:08,569
That's good.

01:01:14,343 --> 01:01:15,553
I wouldn't be bothering you here,

886
01:01:15,636 --> 01:01:18,305
but your people keep telling me
you're unavailable.

887
01:01:18,389 --> 01:01:19,723
Will you walk with me?

Mr. Wayne.

891
01:01:28,232 --> 01:01:31,318
You know, you really could be
doing more for this city.

892
01:01:31,902 --> 01:01:33,738
Your family has
a history of philanthropy,

893
01:01:33,821 --> 01:01:36,240
but as far as I can tell,
you're not doing anything.

894
01:01:36,323 --> 01:01:38,784
If I'm elected, I want to change that.

895
01:01:39,368 --> 01:01:40,661
Thank you.

I'm gonna go pay my respects.
Will you wait for me?

898
01:01:46,959 --> 01:01:48,586
I want to continue this.

899

Excuse me.

Can I talk to you?

[Mackenzie] What?

905
01:02:07,229 --> 01:02:09,523
He hasn't been heard from

Christ, not again.

907

You got people looking for him, Jim?

[Gordon] Sent a couple guys
to his house. Nothing.

910
01:02:20,201 --> 01:02:21,118
[Mackenzie] What'd his wife say?

911
01:02:21,202 --> 01:02:22,411
[Gordon] She hadn't heard from him.

Please.

He made me do it.
[tearfully] I'm so sorry.

He told me if I didn't do exactly
what he said, he'd kill me.

I'm so sorry.

Looks like a combination lock.

Can't we just cut it off?

960

Not if you want to keep your head.

- "Justice."
- Huh?

1010

The answer's "justice."

- [raises voice] How much?
- Ten grand. Ten Gs a month.

What cases?

1029

- [Batman] The rat.

I'm a dead man either way.
You're talking to a dead man, okay?

I have family, people I love.

- Who will?

- People are watching.
- What people?

[Martinez]
Who do you think he is under there?

1059
01:10:37,156 --> 01:10:37,990
[Gordon] Take it easy.

1060
01:10:38,074 --> 01:10:39,075
[Martinez] I want to see.

1061
01:10:40,409 --> 01:10:41,619
[medic] What is that thing? Leather?

1062
01:10:45,372 --> 01:10:46,832
[medic 2] What's he got on his eyes?

1063
01:10:46,916 --> 01:10:48,375
[Martinez] Who cares?
I want to see his face.

1064
01:10:48,459 --> 01:10:49,668
What are we doing here?
Let's just take it off...

1065
01:10:49,752 --> 01:10:50,920
- [Gordon] Hey!
- [officers clamoring]

1066
01:10:51,504 --> 01:10:54,632
Hey! Hey! Hey!

1067
01:10:54,715 --> 01:10:56,383
Relax, God damn it!

1068
01:10:56,467 --> 01:10:57,968
You're protecting this guy, Jim?

1069
01:10:59,386 --> 01:11:01,931
He interfered in
an active hostage situation.

1070
01:11:02,014 --> 01:11:04,433
Colson's blood is on his hands.

1071
01:11:04,517 --> 01:11:05,935
Maybe it's on yours.

1072
01:11:07,394 --> 01:11:08,437
What'd you say?

1073
01:11:08,521 --> 01:11:10,106
He would rather die than talk.

1074
01:11:10,689 --> 01:11:12,191
What was he afraid of?

1075
01:11:12,942 --> 01:11:14,026
You?

1076

[menacing music playing]

1077
01:11:21,158 --> 01:11:22,576
You son of a bitch.

1078
01:11:23,160 --> 01:11:26,163
You have any idea
what kind of trouble you're in?

1079
01:11:26,247 --> 01:11:27,957
You could be an accessory to murder.

1080
01:11:28,040 --> 01:11:29,041
[officer] Why are we playing games...

1081
01:11:29,166 --> 01:11:30,835
[officers clamoring]

1082
01:11:31,168 --> 01:11:32,044
[Officer 2] Get him! Come on!

1083
01:11:32,128 --> 01:11:34,130
Back off! Back off!

1084
01:11:34,213 --> 01:11:36,507
Great, now I got you
on assaulting an officer!

1085
01:11:36,590 --> 01:11:38,676
- You got me on assaulting three.
- Hey!

1086
01:11:38,759 --> 01:11:41,554
What's the matter with you?
This isn't the way to do this!

1087
01:11:41,929 --> 01:11:43,681
[breathing heavily]

1088
01:11:44,223 --> 01:11:45,766
You too now?

1089
01:11:45,850 --> 01:11:48,394
Let me handle this, Chief.
Just give me a minute.

1090
01:11:48,477 --> 01:11:51,063
You're gonna put yourself on the line
for this scumbag, Jim?

1091
01:11:51,147 --> 01:11:53,399
Just give me a minute.
I'll get him to cooperate.

1092
01:11:56,193 --> 01:11:57,695
Okay, give him the room.

1093
01:12:13,335 --> 01:12:14,628
Two minutes.

1094
01:12:26,390 --> 01:12:27,975
You listen to me.

1095
01:12:29,560 --> 01:12:31,562
[softly] We gotta get you out of here.

1096
01:12:33,230 --> 01:12:35,191
That would put a lot of heat on you.

1097
01:12:35,274 --> 01:12:36,942
Well, you punched me in the face.

1098
01:12:38,027 --> 01:12:39,111
[Batman scoffs]

1099
01:12:39,195 --> 01:12:40,488
Take this key.

1100
01:12:41,781 --> 01:12:45,159
Through that door. Hallway to the stairs
that go to the roof.

1101
01:12:46,202 --> 01:12:47,912
[Kenzie] Hey, what the hell
is going on here?

1102
01:12:48,913 --> 01:12:51,207
Hey, hey, hey, what's going on?

1103

[suspenseful music playing]

1104
01:12:54,585 --> 01:12:56,962
Who's the mustache with the broken nose?

1105
01:13:00,382 --> 01:13:03,094
That's Kenzie. Narcotics.

1106
01:13:03,177 --> 01:13:06,097
He's one of the guys I got into it with
at the Iceberg Lounge.

1107
01:13:07,014 --> 01:13:09,642
What are you saying?
Kenzie moonlights for the Penguin?

1108
01:13:12,353 --> 01:13:14,313
Or he moonlights as a cop.

1109
01:13:18,901 --> 01:13:20,403
- [officer] Jesus Christ!
- [Kenzie] Go!

1110
01:13:20,486 --> 01:13:21,987
[officer 2] Somebody stop him!

1111
01:13:22,571 --> 01:13:24,448

[Gordon] Could have at least
pulled that punch, man.

1120
01:14:50,576 --> 01:14:51,786
I did.

1121
01:14:51,869 --> 01:14:55,247
Bock put out an APB on you.
You really think he's in on this?

1122
01:14:55,331 --> 01:14:57,374
I don't trust any of 'em. Do you?

1123
01:14:57,458 --> 01:14:58,584
I only trust you.

1124
01:14:58,667 --> 01:15:01,003
What's a narcotics cop doing
with Falcone's right-hand man?

1125
01:15:01,087 --> 01:15:04,465
Colson said, "Cops protect the rat."
Maybe Kenzie's part of it.

1126
01:15:05,216 --> 01:15:06,342
You think Penguin's the rat?

1127
01:15:06,425 --> 01:15:09,470
His club caters to the mob.
Maroni practically lived there.

1128
01:15:09,553 --> 01:15:11,514
Penguin would have been
privy to a lot of dirt.

1129
01:15:11,597 --> 01:15:12,932
DA was a regular too.

1130
01:15:13,015 --> 01:15:16,519
Maybe Penguin got himself into a jam
and working a deal was his only way out.

1131
01:15:17,603 --> 01:15:18,813
The <i>Rata Alada.</i>

1132
01:15:18,896 --> 01:15:19,855
The what?

1133
01:15:19,939 --> 01:15:21,398
Riddler's latest.

1134
01:15:21,482 --> 01:15:23,192
The cipher in the maze.

1135
01:15:23,275 --> 01:15:25,778
It means "a rat with wings."
Like a stool pigeon.

1136
01:15:27,363 --> 01:15:28,989
A penguin's got wings too.

1137
01:15:30,991 --> 01:15:32,952
Time for me
to have another conversation with him.

1138
01:15:33,035 --> 01:15:34,703
What about the Riddler?
He's gonna kill again.

1139
01:15:34,787 --> 01:15:37,998
It's all connected.
Like it or not, it's his game now.

1140
01:15:38,082 --> 01:15:41,252
You want to find Riddler,
we gotta find that rat.

The recycling plant.

[Batman] <i>I'm here.</i>

1151

- [Penguin] How you doing?
- [man] Yeah, good. How are you?

1152
01:16:22,752 --> 01:16:25,254
[Penguin] Good, good.
Let's get in out of this deluge.

It's a drug lab. Drops.

This is a buy.

1157
01:16:48,402 --> 01:16:51,572
Looks like they got Maroni's operation
up and running again.

1158
01:16:51,655 --> 01:16:52,823
Or they never shut it down at all.

1159

[Gordon] <i>What are you saying?</i>

1160
01:16:53,866 --> 01:16:56,994
The biggest drug bust in GCPD history
was a fraud?

- Yeah. I thought you were "Vengeance."

1423

Your friend got involved

She didn't know any better.

1425

What the hell is that supposed to mean?

1427
01:36:58,195 --> 01:36:59,697
It means your choices have consequences.

1429
01:37:02,241 --> 01:37:04,952
You know, whoever the hell you are,
you obviously grew up rich.

- What?

1431

You don't know

1435

Falcone owes me that money.

- He owes you?
- Yeah, and a lot more.

1437

Oh, really? Why's that?

1438
01:37:23,971 --> 01:37:24,889
You know what? I can't even talk to you.

1439
01:37:24,972 --> 01:37:26,724
No! I want to know
why a guy like Falcone

1440
01:37:26,807 --> 01:37:27,808
would owe you anything.

1441
01:37:27,892 --> 01:37:30,227
[shouts]
Because he's my father!

1442

My mother worked at the 44 Below.

1443
01:37:43,657 --> 01:37:44,950
Just like Anni.

1444
01:37:47,119 --> 01:37:49,663
She used to take me there
when I was a little girl.

1445
01:37:51,749 --> 01:37:53,084
To the club?

1446
01:37:54,001 --> 01:37:55,002
Yeah.

1447
01:37:57,713 --> 01:38:00,591
I hid out in the dressing room
while she worked.

1448
01:38:01,050 --> 01:38:02,802
Used to see him there.

1449
01:38:03,552 --> 01:38:05,554
He scared the shit out of me.

1450
01:38:07,515 --> 01:38:10,976
And I could never understand
why he looked at me the way he did.

1451
01:38:11,519 --> 01:38:15,356
Then one night,
my mother told me who he was.

1452
01:38:18,734 --> 01:38:21,070
When I was seven,
my mother was murdered.

1453
01:38:21,737 --> 01:38:23,239
Strangled.

1454
01:38:23,656 --> 01:38:27,118
Never found out who.
Probably some creep from the club.

1455
01:38:28,994 --> 01:38:31,080
Anyway, social services
came to take me away,

1456
01:38:31,163 --> 01:38:33,332
and he didn't say a thing.

1457
01:38:35,167 --> 01:38:36,961
Couldn't even look at me.

1458
01:38:40,714 --> 01:38:42,466
He owes me that money.

1459
01:38:44,260 --> 01:38:45,678
I'm sorry.

1460
01:38:46,804 --> 01:38:47,972
For what I said.

1461
01:38:49,348 --> 01:38:50,766
Oh, it's all right.

to go after these creeps.

1577
01:45:18,904 --> 01:45:20,740
But you'd be surprised

1578
01:45:20,823 --> 01:45:23,200
what even a good man like him

1579
01:45:23,284 --> 01:45:25,870
is capable of in the right situation.

1580
01:45:28,122 --> 01:45:29,582
Do me a favor.

1581
01:45:29,915 --> 01:45:31,959
Don't lose any sleep over it.

1582
01:45:32,668 --> 01:45:34,253
This reporter

1583
01:45:35,087 --> 01:45:36,672
was a lowlife.

1584
01:45:36,756 --> 01:45:38,215
He was on Maroni's payroll.

1585
01:45:39,842 --> 01:45:41,469
- Maroni?
- Oh, yeah.

1586
01:45:42,219 --> 01:45:45,473
He could never stand
your father and I had history.

1587
01:45:46,891 --> 01:45:50,394
And after what happened
with that reporter, Maroni was worried

1588
01:45:50,478 --> 01:45:52,813
that your father would be in my pocket,

1589
01:45:53,564 --> 01:45:54,565
forever.

1590
01:45:55,232 --> 01:45:57,276
He would have done anything

1591
01:45:57,359 --> 01:45:59,528
to keep him from becoming mayor.

1592
01:45:59,612 --> 01:46:00,946
You understand?

1593
01:46:02,156 --> 01:46:06,702
Are you saying Salvatore Maroni
got my father killed?

1594
01:46:06,786 --> 01:46:08,829
Do I know it for a fact?

1595
01:46:11,248 --> 01:46:13,334
I'm just saying,
it sure looked that way to me.

1596
01:46:14,710 --> 01:46:17,004
This is what you wanted, huh?

1597
01:46:17,088 --> 01:46:19,507
This little conversation here?

1598
01:46:20,007 --> 01:46:21,425
[exhales ruefully]

1599
01:46:21,926 --> 01:46:24,095
It's been a long time coming, huh?

1600
01:46:26,722 --> 01:46:28,849
I mean, you ain't a kid no more.

1601
01:46:32,311 --> 01:46:34,396
[melancholy music playing]

1602
01:47:18,524 --> 01:47:20,484
[EKG machine beeping]

1603
01:47:23,946 --> 01:47:25,614
[inhales sharply]

1604
01:47:30,870 --> 01:47:32,621
[rain pattering]

1605
01:47:35,416 --> 01:47:36,500
[sighs]

1606
01:47:38,252 --> 01:47:39,545
You lied to me...

1607
01:47:42,381 --> 01:47:44,008
my whole life.

1608
01:47:49,180 --> 01:47:51,223
I spoke to Carmine Falcone.

1609
01:47:54,310 --> 01:47:57,605
He told me what he did for my father.

1610
01:48:01,609 --> 01:48:03,110
About Salvatore Maroni.

1611
01:48:05,112 --> 01:48:07,823
He told you Salvatore Maroni...

1612
01:48:07,907 --> 01:48:09,658
Had my father killed.

1613
01:48:12,119 --> 01:48:14,330
Why didn't you tell me all this?

1614
01:48:17,083 --> 01:48:21,629
All these years
I've spent fighting for him,

1615
01:48:21,712 --> 01:48:24,048
believing that he was a good man.

1616
01:48:24,131 --> 01:48:25,716
He was a good man.

1617
01:48:26,884 --> 01:48:28,594
You listen to me.

1618
01:48:28,677 --> 01:48:32,098
Your father was a good man.

1619
01:48:35,726 --> 01:48:37,645
- He made a mistake.
- A "mistake."

1620
01:48:37,728 --> 01:48:39,647
He had a man killed.

1621
01:48:39,730 --> 01:48:40,815
Why?

1622
01:48:41,982 --> 01:48:45,236
[sighing] To protect his family image?

1623
01:48:46,320 --> 01:48:47,571
His political aspirations?

1624
01:48:47,655 --> 01:48:51,200
It wasn't to protect the family image,
and he didn't have anyone killed.

1625
01:48:53,786 --> 01:48:55,329
He was protecting your mother.

1626
01:48:56,288 --> 01:48:59,834
He didn't care about his image
or the campaign, any of that.

1627
01:48:59,917 --> 01:49:02,044
He cared about her,

1628
01:49:02,128 --> 01:49:03,421
and you,

1629
01:49:03,504 --> 01:49:06,424
and in a moment of weakness,
he turned to Falcone.

1630
01:49:06,507 --> 01:49:09,969
But he never thought Falcone
would kill that man.

1631
01:49:10,845 --> 01:49:14,181
Your father should have known
that Falcone would do anything

1632
01:49:14,265 --> 01:49:17,393
to finally have something on him
that he could use.

1633
01:49:17,476 --> 01:49:19,311
That's who Falcone is.

1634
01:49:21,564 --> 01:49:23,774
And that was your father's mistake.

1635
01:49:23,858 --> 01:49:25,901
But when Falcone
told him what he'd done,

1636
01:49:25,985 --> 01:49:28,738
your father was distraught.

1637
01:49:29,613 --> 01:49:32,825
He told Falcone
he was going to the police,

1638
01:49:32,908 --> 01:49:35,077
that he would confess everything.

1639
01:49:36,579 --> 01:49:38,581
And that night,

1640
01:49:38,664 --> 01:49:42,585
your father and your mother were killed.

1641
01:49:45,004 --> 01:49:47,173
[soft music playing]

1642
01:49:48,090 --> 01:49:49,842
It was Falcone?

1643
01:49:54,346 --> 01:49:55,806
[smacks lips]

1644
01:49:55,890 --> 01:49:58,017
Oh, I wish I knew for sure.

1645
01:50:02,730 --> 01:50:06,275
Or maybe it was some random thug
on the street

1646
01:50:06,358 --> 01:50:09,111
who needed money, got scared,
and pulled the trigger too fast.

1647
01:50:09,195 --> 01:50:14,408
If you don't think I've spent every day
searching for that answer...

1648
01:50:16,160 --> 01:50:20,039
It was my job to protect them.
Do you understand?

1649
01:50:20,706 --> 01:50:22,500
I know you always blamed yourself.

1650
01:50:22,583 --> 01:50:25,127
You were only a boy, Bruce.

1651
01:50:27,296 --> 01:50:29,590
I could see the fear in your eyes,

1652
01:50:31,008 --> 01:50:33,385
but I didn't know how to help.

1653
01:50:33,469 --> 01:50:35,971
I could teach you how to fight, [sighs]

1654
01:50:37,348 --> 01:50:40,017
but I wasn't equipped
to take care of you.

1655
01:50:40,101 --> 01:50:41,936
You needed a father.

1656
01:50:43,896 --> 01:50:46,315
And all you had was me.

1657
01:50:48,692 --> 01:50:49,902
I'm sorry.

1658
01:50:51,654 --> 01:50:53,572
Don't be sorry, Alfred.

1659
01:51:00,371 --> 01:51:01,455
God.

1660
01:51:04,500 --> 01:51:08,921
I never thought
I'd feel fear like that again.

1661
01:51:11,632 --> 01:51:13,759
I thought I'd mastered all that.

1662
01:51:20,182 --> 01:51:21,434
I mean,

1663
01:51:22,643 --> 01:51:24,770
I'm not afraid to die.

1664
01:51:26,522 --> 01:51:28,899
I realize now there's something

1665
01:51:30,025 --> 01:51:31,902
I haven't got past.

1666
01:51:32,820 --> 01:51:34,572
This fear...

1667
01:51:37,032 --> 01:51:39,994
of ever going through any of that again.

1668
01:51:44,248 --> 01:51:46,459
Of losing somebody I care about.

1669
01:51:47,793 --> 01:51:50,087
[soft music continues]

1670
01:52:14,403 --> 01:52:16,113
[soft dramatic music playing]

1671
01:52:19,116 --> 01:52:20,785
[engine revving]

1672
01:52:37,051 --> 01:52:38,010
Hey.

1673
01:52:38,094 --> 01:52:40,846
I saw the signal. That's not you?

1674
01:52:40,930 --> 01:52:42,848
I thought it was you.

1675
01:52:47,019 --> 01:52:48,395
[both grunting]

1676
01:52:55,778 --> 01:52:57,321
- I found him!
- I see that.

1677
01:52:57,405 --> 01:52:58,906
He had my shit and my phone.

1678
01:52:58,989 --> 01:53:00,199
She left a message
the night they took her.

1679
01:53:00,282 --> 01:53:01,200
She called me...

1680
01:53:01,283 --> 01:53:02,993
Gordon! Help me out, man!

1681
01:53:03,077 --> 01:53:04,370
She got my gun!

1682
01:53:04,620 --> 01:53:05,621
[grunts]

1683
01:53:05,704 --> 01:53:07,415
- Shut up!
- Put the gun down.

1684
01:53:08,958 --> 01:53:11,502
I'm telling you, God damn it!
She called me!

1685
01:53:16,090 --> 01:53:18,175
- [cell phone beeps]
- Here. Listen.

1686
01:53:20,136 --> 01:53:21,804
[Kenzie on recording]
<i>Hey! Get back here!</i>

1687
01:53:21,929 --> 01:53:24,098
- [Annika whimpering]
- <i>Where you going? Come back here!</i>

1688
01:53:24,181 --> 01:53:26,267
[Falcone] <i>Hey, hey,
what are you doing, Kenzie?</i>

1689
01:53:26,350 --> 01:53:27,685
<i>You're scaring her.</i>

1690
01:53:27,768 --> 01:53:29,478
[Kenzie] <i>I'm sorry, Mr. Falcone.</i>

1691
01:53:29,562 --> 01:53:30,604
[Annika, tearfully]
<i>Please, please, please.</i>

1692
01:53:30,688 --> 01:53:31,981
<i>Please, don't hurt me, please.</i>

1693
01:53:32,064 --> 01:53:34,734
[Falcone]
<i>Hey, don't be scared. Come here.</i>

1694
01:53:36,610 --> 01:53:38,654
<i>Now let me ask you again.</i>

1695
01:53:39,363 --> 01:53:41,907
- <i>What did Mitchell tell you?</i>
- [Annika] <i>No, nothing. He...</i>

1696
01:53:41,991 --> 01:53:44,910
[Falcone] <i>Don liked to talk.
I know that.</i>

1697
01:53:44,994 --> 01:53:47,705
<i>Especially to pretty girls like you.</i>

1698
01:53:48,247 --> 01:53:50,249
<i>That's why I made him
take your passport...</i>

1699
01:53:50,958 --> 01:53:53,836
<i>until we could have
this little conversation.</i>

1700
01:53:53,919 --> 01:53:56,630
[Annika] <i>All I want to do
is get out of here, okay?</i>

1701
01:53:56,714 --> 01:53:58,841
<i>You'll never hear from me again,
nobody will. Please, please...</i>

1702
01:53:58,924 --> 01:54:02,052
[Falcone] <i>We're gonna get you
out of here, I promise.</i>

1703
01:54:02,887 --> 01:54:05,431
<i>But first, I gotta know...</i>

1704
01:54:06,515 --> 01:54:07,850
<i>What did he tell you?</i>

1705
01:54:08,642 --> 01:54:12,188
[Annika] <i>He just said
they all made a deal with you.</i>

1706
01:54:12,688 --> 01:54:13,898
[Falcone] <i>Oh. Hmm.</i>

1707
01:54:13,981 --> 01:54:15,941
<i>He told you about that, huh?</i>

1708
01:54:16,025 --> 01:54:17,318
<i>The deal.</i>

1709
01:54:17,401 --> 01:54:22,323
[Annika] <i>He said you gave some
information on some drops thing</i>

1710
01:54:22,406 --> 01:54:25,117
<i>and that's how he became mayor.</i>

1711
01:54:25,201 --> 01:54:27,578
<i>He said you were a very important man.</i>

1712
01:54:27,661 --> 01:54:28,788
[Falcone] <i>Right.</i>

1713
01:54:29,538 --> 01:54:30,915
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

1714
01:54:31,874 --> 01:54:34,043
<i>Hmm. Okay.</i>

1715
01:54:36,128 --> 01:54:37,880
- [tussling on recording]
- [Annika screams]

1716
01:54:38,839 --> 01:54:40,341
- [Annika cries]
- [tussling continues]

1717
01:54:41,717 --> 01:54:43,052
- [Falcone] <i>Just take it easy.</i>
- [Annika choking]

1718
01:54:43,135 --> 01:54:44,678
Jesus, he's strangling her.

1719
01:54:44,762 --> 01:54:47,807
[Falcone] <i>Take it easy.</i>

1720
01:54:49,934 --> 01:54:51,352
[recording stops]

1721
01:54:57,024 --> 01:54:58,317
<i>Rata Alada.</i>

1722
01:55:03,072 --> 01:55:04,865
A falcon has wings too.

1723
01:55:05,199 --> 01:55:07,034
Falcone is the rat?

1724
01:55:18,003 --> 01:55:21,173
Falcone works for you guys?

1725
01:55:21,841 --> 01:55:24,385
The mayor? The DA?

1726
01:55:27,388 --> 01:55:28,472
No.

1727
01:55:28,806 --> 01:55:30,307
[breathing shakily]

1728
01:55:31,559 --> 01:55:32,852
We work for him.

1729
01:55:33,853 --> 01:55:35,104
Everybody does.

1730
01:55:35,187 --> 01:55:36,188
How?

1731
01:55:36,272 --> 01:55:37,857
Through Renewal.

1732
01:55:38,649 --> 01:55:40,025
Renewal is everything.

1733
01:55:40,109 --> 01:55:41,444
- The Renewal Fund?
- [Kenzie] Yeah.

1734
01:55:42,027 --> 01:55:45,740
After Thomas Wayne died,
they all went after it like vultures.

1735
01:55:45,823 --> 01:55:49,410
The mayor, Falcone, Maroni.
Everyone got in on it.

1736
01:55:49,493 --> 01:55:52,872
It was perfect for making bribes,
laundering money.

1737
01:55:52,955 --> 01:55:55,040
A huge charitable fund
with no oversight.

1738
01:55:55,124 --> 01:55:56,834
Everybody got a piece.

1739
01:55:56,917 --> 01:55:58,753
But Falcone wanted more.

1740
01:56:00,546 --> 01:56:03,758
So he orchestrated a play
to take Maroni down big.

1741
01:56:05,176 --> 01:56:07,511
He'd rat out his drops operation,

1742
01:56:07,887 --> 01:56:10,598
make the careers of everybody
that went after him,

1743
01:56:10,681 --> 01:56:13,142
then install them all as his puppets.

1744
01:56:13,225 --> 01:56:15,770
You think this goddamn election matters?

1745
01:56:17,396 --> 01:56:19,315
Falcone's the mayor.

1746
01:56:20,274 --> 01:56:22,777
He's been the mayor
for the last 20 years.

1747
01:56:22,860 --> 01:56:24,236
Come on, Vengeance.

1748
01:56:24,945 --> 01:56:26,781
Let's go kill that son of a bitch.

1749

- But not that way.
- There is no other way!

1754

we may never find the Riddler.

I have to stop her.

I'd like to come up?

He ain't seein' nobody tonight.

1775

I could talk to you for a minute?

And I know
that you're a very important man.

1789

I was hoping that maybe
you could help me find her...

- I'm so sorry.
- I understand. Here.

No, that's okay, I have a tissue.

Vinnie! Didn't I tell you?

1798
01:59:22,415 --> 01:59:25,334
I'm sorry, Mr. Falcone. I really think
you're gonna want to see this.

[officer] Police! Hands up!

1924
02:08:24,915 --> 02:08:28,419
[Gordon] He said put your goddamn
hands up, you son of a bitch.

1925
02:08:28,544 --> 02:08:30,254
[tense music continues]

1926
02:08:37,678 --> 02:08:38,721
[stool creaking]

1927
02:08:47,563 --> 02:08:49,482
I just ordered a slice of pumpkin pie.

1928
02:08:52,443 --> 02:08:53,736
[Martinez] Stay still!

1929
02:08:53,819 --> 02:08:54,820
Now!

1930
02:08:56,864 --> 02:08:58,282
[handcuffs clicking]

1931
02:09:01,744 --> 02:09:03,370
[tense music continues]

1932
02:09:23,474 --> 02:09:25,267
[Martinez] Which one is you?

1933
02:09:25,351 --> 02:09:26,852
[laughs gleefully] You tell me.

1934
02:09:27,686 --> 02:09:29,146
Let's go, pencil-neck.

1935
02:09:32,233 --> 02:09:33,984
Get that son of a bitch out of here!

1936
02:09:34,402 --> 02:09:36,153
[eerie music playing]

1937
02:09:42,576 --> 02:09:44,078
[siren wailing in distance]

1938
02:09:48,499 --> 02:09:51,419
[newscaster] <i>...where even murdered

1941

Hey.

02:10:01,011 --> 02:10:02,555
[suspenseful music playing]

1943
02:10:22,324 --> 02:10:24,034
What are all these diaries?

1944
02:10:24,118 --> 02:10:26,537
They're ledgers. He's got thousands.

1945
02:10:26,620 --> 02:10:30,166
He scrawled all over 'em.
Rambling, ciphers, codes.

1946
02:10:30,249 --> 02:10:31,792
Got something back on one of the IDs.

1947
02:10:31,876 --> 02:10:34,170
Edward Nashton. Works at KTMJ.

1948
02:10:34,253 --> 02:10:36,088
- He's a forensic accountant.
- Accountant?

1949
02:10:36,172 --> 02:10:38,591
Hey, Lieutenant!
You really okay with this?

1950
02:10:38,674 --> 02:10:40,426
What about chain of evidence?

1951
02:10:41,260 --> 02:10:42,470
You should see this.

1952
02:10:48,434 --> 02:10:49,935
He's wearing gloves.

1953
02:10:51,395 --> 02:10:53,647
"Friday, July 16th.

1954
02:10:53,731 --> 02:10:57,443
My life has been a cruel riddle
I could not solve,

1955
02:10:57,777 --> 02:11:00,821
suffocating my mind, no escape.

1956
02:11:00,905 --> 02:11:02,323
But then, today, I saw it.

1957
02:11:02,406 --> 02:11:06,535
A single word on this ledger,
sitting on the desk beside me.

1958
02:11:07,870 --> 02:11:09,663
'Renewal.'

1959
02:11:09,747 --> 02:11:14,168
The empty promise they sold to me
as a child in that orphanage.

1960
02:11:14,251 --> 02:11:17,379
One look inside,
and finally I understood.

1961
02:11:17,463 --> 02:11:20,800
My whole life
has been preparing me for this.

1962
02:11:20,883 --> 02:11:23,344
The moment when I would learn the truth.

1963
02:11:23,427 --> 02:11:26,430
When I could finally strike back
and expose their lies."

1964
02:11:27,556 --> 02:11:29,391
- [rats squeaking]
- "If you want people to understand,

1965
02:11:29,475 --> 02:11:31,310
really understand,

1966
02:11:31,393 --> 02:11:33,687
you can't just give them the answers.

1967
02:11:33,771 --> 02:11:35,231
You have to confront them,

1968
02:11:35,314 --> 02:11:37,733
torture them
with the horrifying questions,

1969
02:11:37,817 --> 02:11:39,985
just like they tortured me.

1970
02:11:40,069 --> 02:11:42,863
I know now what I must become."

1971
02:11:45,825 --> 02:11:47,159
Jesus.

[bat screeching]

1973
02:11:53,249 --> 02:11:55,209
I don't think that rat likes you, man.

1974
02:11:55,751 --> 02:11:57,253
This one's not a rat.

1975
02:11:57,670 --> 02:11:59,672
- [rat continues squeaking]
- [cages rattling]

1976
02:12:03,884 --> 02:12:04,927
[screeching violently]

1977
02:12:13,894 --> 02:12:15,020
[Gordon] What is that?

1978
02:12:17,731 --> 02:12:19,233
[bat screeching frantically]

1979
02:12:46,635 --> 02:12:47,845
[officer] Some kind of pry tool?

1980
02:12:47,928 --> 02:12:49,305
Is it a chisel?

1981
02:12:49,388 --> 02:12:50,848
[Batman] It's a murder weapon.

1982
02:12:50,931 --> 02:12:52,308
He killed Mitchell with it.

1983
02:12:52,975 --> 02:12:55,853
The edge will match the floorboard
impression in the mayor's study.

1984
02:13:04,445 --> 02:13:06,447
"My confession"?

1985
02:13:06,530 --> 02:13:09,408
What's he confessing to?
He already told us he killed Mitchell.

1986
02:13:09,492 --> 02:13:10,868
This isn't over.

1987
02:13:10,951 --> 02:13:13,370
[officer 2] Oh, man. He's been posting
all kinds of shit online.

1988
02:13:13,788 --> 02:13:15,998
He's got, like, 500 followers.
Real fringe types.

1989
02:13:16,373 --> 02:13:17,666
[typing]

1990
02:13:24,090 --> 02:13:26,300
His final post was last night.

1991
02:13:26,383 --> 02:13:29,595
Some video. Got a lot of views,
but it's password-protected.

1992
02:13:29,678 --> 02:13:32,681
- [Gordon] Can you get in?
- [officer 2] Copying his drive now.

1993
02:13:32,807 --> 02:13:36,227
Take some time, but we'll get in.

1994
02:13:36,727 --> 02:13:38,312
[ominous music playing]

1995
02:13:47,571 --> 02:13:50,116
- [Gordon] Show me the post.
- [officer 2] It's right here.

1996
02:13:51,742 --> 02:13:53,452
[Gordon] "The Truth Unmasked."

1997
02:13:54,286 --> 02:13:55,913
I think I'm his last target.

1998
02:13:58,499 --> 02:13:59,583
You?

1999
02:13:59,959 --> 02:14:02,002
Maybe this is all coming to an end.

2000
02:14:02,545 --> 02:14:03,921
What is?

2001
02:14:04,380 --> 02:14:05,798
The Batman.

2002
02:14:06,048 --> 02:14:07,216
[cell phone ringing]

2003
02:14:11,178 --> 02:14:12,346
Yeah?

2004
02:14:23,649 --> 02:14:24,859
Right.

2005
02:14:27,737 --> 02:14:31,699
Riddler's asking for you. At Arkham.

2006
02:14:39,165 --> 02:14:40,666
You're a good cop.

2007
02:15:05,274 --> 02:15:07,651
[over speaker]
<i>I told you I'd see you in hell.</i>

2008
02:15:08,402 --> 02:15:10,237
[Batman] <i>What do you want from me?</i>

2009
02:15:10,321 --> 02:15:11,864
[Riddler] "Want"?

2010
02:15:12,448 --> 02:15:16,077
<i>If only you knew how long
I've been waiting for this day.</i>

2011
02:15:17,286 --> 02:15:18,621
<i>For this moment.</i>

2012
02:15:19,663 --> 02:15:22,666
I've been invisible my whole life.

2013
02:15:23,751 --> 02:15:26,378
I guess I won't be anymore, will I?

2014
02:15:27,922 --> 02:15:30,341
<i>They'll remember me now.</i>

2015
02:15:30,424 --> 02:15:32,259
<i>They'll remember both of us.</i>

2016
02:15:42,645 --> 02:15:44,605
<i>Bruce...</i>

2017
02:15:47,483 --> 02:15:49,318
<i>Wayne.</i>

2018
02:15:51,695 --> 02:15:55,449
[slowly] Bruce...

2019
02:15:56,867 --> 02:15:59,745
<i>Wayne.</i>

02:16:05,501 --> 02:16:06,544
[exhales deeply]

2021
02:16:11,006 --> 02:16:13,426
<i>You know, I was there that day.</i>

2022
02:16:16,011 --> 02:16:19,390
<i>The day the great Thomas Wayne
announced he was running for mayor,</i>

2023
02:16:19,473 --> 02:16:21,851
<i>made all those promises.</i>

2024
02:16:24,311 --> 02:16:28,566
<i>Well, a week later he was dead,
and everybody just forgot about us.</i>

2025
02:16:29,108 --> 02:16:32,653
<i>All they could talk about
was poor Bruce Wayne.</i>

2026
02:16:32,737 --> 02:16:36,407
<i>Bruce Wayne, the orphan.</i>

2027
02:16:36,991 --> 02:16:38,534
<i>Orphan.</i>

2028
02:16:44,206 --> 02:16:49,336
<i>Living in some tower over the park
isn't being an orphan.</i>

2029
02:16:50,629 --> 02:16:55,259
<i>Looking down on everyone,
with all that money.</i>

2030
02:16:55,926 --> 02:16:57,470
<i>Don't you tell me.</i>

2031
02:17:00,097 --> 02:17:02,767
Do you know what being an orphan is?

2032
02:17:03,142 --> 02:17:05,728
<i>It's 30 kids to a room.</i>

2033
02:17:07,021 --> 02:17:11,067
<i>Twelve years old and already a drophead,
numbing the pain.</i>

2034
02:17:12,777 --> 02:17:17,448
<i>You wake up screaming
with rats chewing your fingers.</i>

2035
02:17:18,616 --> 02:17:21,786
<i>And every winter one of the babies die</i>

2036
02:17:21,869 --> 02:17:24,163
<i>because it's so cold.</i>

2037
02:17:25,456 --> 02:17:28,042
<i>But, oh, no.</i>

2038
02:17:29,335 --> 02:17:30,586
[smacks lips]

2039
02:17:30,961 --> 02:17:34,131
<i>Let's talk about the billionaire
with the lying, dead daddy</i>

2040
02:17:34,215 --> 02:17:37,134
<i>because at least the money
makes it go down easy.</i>

2041
02:17:37,218 --> 02:17:38,219
<i>Doesn't it?</i>

2042
02:17:39,678 --> 02:17:41,722
<i>Bruce...</i>

2043
02:17:42,765 --> 02:17:44,683
<i>Wayne.</i>

2044
02:17:48,354 --> 02:17:51,440
<i>He's the only one we didn't get.</i>

2045
02:17:54,860 --> 02:17:57,988
<i>But we got the rest of 'em, didn't we?</i>

2046
02:17:59,448 --> 02:18:03,327
<i>All those slick, sleazy, phony pricks.</i>

2047
02:18:06,497 --> 02:18:07,665
<i>God.</i>

2048
02:18:08,666 --> 02:18:09,959
<i>Look at you.</i>

2049
02:18:11,627 --> 02:18:14,088
Your mask is amazing.

2050
02:18:14,171 --> 02:18:17,091
I wish you could've seen me in mine.

2051
02:18:17,174 --> 02:18:18,259
Ain't it funny?

2052
02:18:18,342 --> 02:18:22,763
<i>All everyone wants to do is unmask you,
but they're missing the point.</i>

2053
02:18:24,223 --> 02:18:26,267
<i>You and I both know</i>

2054
02:18:27,226 --> 02:18:29,728
I'm looking at the real you right now.

2055
02:18:29,812 --> 02:18:33,441
My mask allowed me
to be myself completely.

2056
02:18:33,524 --> 02:18:35,067
<i>No shame,</i>

2057
02:18:35,985 --> 02:18:36,986
<i>no limits.</i>

2058
02:18:37,069 --> 02:18:38,738
<i>Why did you write me?</i>

2059
02:18:39,613 --> 02:18:40,614
<i>What do you mean?</i>

2060
02:18:40,698 --> 02:18:42,408
<i>All those cards.</i>

2061
02:18:42,491 --> 02:18:43,701
<i>I told you,</i>

2062
02:18:44,410 --> 02:18:46,328
<i>we've been doing this together.
You're a part of this.</i>

2063
02:18:46,412 --> 02:18:48,622
- <i>We didn't do anything together.</i>
- We did.

2064
02:18:48,706 --> 02:18:50,166
<i>What did we just do?</i>

2065
02:18:50,249 --> 02:18:52,251
<i>I asked you to bring him into the light,
and you did.</i>

2066
02:18:52,334 --> 02:18:53,502
<i>We're such a good team.</i>

2067
02:18:53,586 --> 02:18:54,587
<i>We're not a team.</i>

2068
02:18:54,670 --> 02:18:57,173
I never could have
gotten him out of there.

2069
02:18:57,256 --> 02:18:59,675
<i>I'm not physical.
My strength is up here.</i>

2070
02:18:59,759 --> 02:19:02,928
<i>I mean, I had all the pieces,
I had the answers.</i>

2071
02:19:03,012 --> 02:19:04,638
But I didn't know
how to make them listen.

2072
02:19:04,722 --> 02:19:05,931
You gave me that.

2073
02:19:06,015 --> 02:19:07,141
<i>I gave you nothing.</i>

2074
02:19:07,224 --> 02:19:09,810
You showed me what was possible.

2075
02:19:09,894 --> 02:19:14,774
<i>You showed me all it takes is fear
and a little focused violence.</i>

2076
02:19:14,857 --> 02:19:16,400
<i>You inspired me.</i>

2077
02:19:16,484 --> 02:19:17,985
<i>You're out of your goddamn mind.</i>

2078
02:19:19,111 --> 02:19:20,196
<i>What?</i>

2079
02:19:20,279 --> 02:19:22,448
<i>This is all in your head.
You're sick, twisted.</i>

2080
02:19:22,531 --> 02:19:23,908
<i>How can you say that?</i>

2081
02:19:23,991 --> 02:19:25,493
You think you'll be remembered?

2082
02:19:25,576 --> 02:19:27,244
<i>You're a pathetic psychopath,</i>

2083
02:19:27,745 --> 02:19:29,497
- begging for attention.
- <i>No.</i>

2084
02:19:29,580 --> 02:19:31,248
- <i>You're gonna die alone in Arkham.</i>
- No.

2085
02:19:31,332 --> 02:19:32,374
<i>No, no!</i>

2086
02:19:32,458 --> 02:19:33,375
<i>A nobody!</i>

2087
02:19:35,169 --> 02:19:36,962
<i>No!</i>

2088
02:19:38,881 --> 02:19:41,258
<i>Ahhh!</i>

2089
02:19:41,509 --> 02:19:44,095
<i>This is not how this was supposed to go!</i>

2090
02:19:45,054 --> 02:19:48,682
<i>Ahhh!</i>

2091
02:19:48,766 --> 02:19:51,393
<i>I had it all planned out!</i>

2092
02:19:52,394 --> 02:19:54,396
<i>We were gonna be safe here.</i>

2093
02:19:54,772 --> 02:19:58,067
