00:04.270 --> 00:06.500
Hello. Hi.

00:07.240 --> 00:11.040
My name is Leslie Knope, and I work for
the Parks and Recreation Department.

00:11.111 --> 00:13.341
Can I ask you
a few questions?

00:14.381 --> 00:16.076
Would you say
that you are,

00:16.149 --> 00:18.310
"Enjoying yourself
and having fun,

00:18.385 --> 00:20.250
"having a moderate
amount of fun

00:20.320 --> 00:21.753
"and somewhat
enjoying yourself,

00:21.821 --> 00:24.517
"or having no fun
and no enjoyment?"

00:25.992 --> 00:27.789
I'm gonna put
a lot of fun.

00:27.861 --> 00:31.058
Ms. Knope,
there's a drunk stuck in the slide.

00:31.631 --> 00:33.292
Sir, this is
a children's slide.

00:33.366 --> 00:35.129
- You're not allowed to sleep in here.
- What is?

00:35.201 --> 00:36.225
<i>You know,</i>
<i>when I first tell people</i>

00:36.302 --> 00:37.428
<i>that I work in the government,</i>
<i>they say,</i>

00:37.504 --> 00:39.335
"Oh. The government.
The government stinks.

00:39.406 --> 00:41.533
"The lines are too long
at the DMV."

00:41.608 --> 00:43.235
<i>But now things</i>
<i>have changed.</i>

00:43.309 --> 00:44.970
<i>People need our help.</i>

00:45.045 --> 00:47.343
And it feels good
to be needed.

00:47.414 --> 00:48.676
Could you put
your arms to your side?

00:48.748 --> 00:49.737
Wait...

00:49.816 --> 00:51.181
And that might help you
slide down a little easier.

00:51.251 --> 00:52.582
We don't...
Do you want to come this way?

00:52.652 --> 00:54.085
Uh-uh.
Okay, we're gonna need you to get out.

00:54.154 --> 00:55.246
Can you
please go away?

00:55.321 --> 00:56.345
Get out of the slide.
Okay?

00:56.423 --> 00:58.118
You're... Can you please go away?
Here we go!

00:58.191 --> 01:00.352
Okay, wake up. Here we go.
Out of the slide.

01:00.427 --> 01:02.895
<i>You know, government</i>
<i>isn't just a boys' club anymore.</i>

01:02.962 --> 01:07.956
Women are everywhere. It's a great
time to be a woman in politics.

01:08.034 --> 01:11.834
<i>Hillary Clinton,</i>
<i>Sarah Palin, me, Nancy Pelosi.</i>

01:12.172 --> 01:13.503
We did it!

01:13.873 --> 01:15.670
<i>You know, I like to</i>
<i>tell people, you know,</i>

01:15.742 --> 01:17.471
<i>"Get on board</i>
<i>and buckle up,</i>

01:17.544 --> 01:19.876
<i>"because my ride's</i>
<i>gonna be a big one."</i>

01:19.946 --> 01:21.573
<i>And if you get motion sickness,</i>
<i>you know,</i>

01:21.648 --> 01:23.206
<i>put your head</i>
<i>between your knees</i>

01:23.283 --> 01:26.150
'cause Leslie Knope's
stopping for no one.

01:28.000 --> 01:34.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:57.450 --> 02:00.317
Tonight
is our next monthly

02:00.386 --> 02:02.217
community outreach
public forum.

02:02.288 --> 02:04.085
And that is tonight.

02:04.491 --> 02:05.685
That is tonight.
Right.

02:05.758 --> 02:07.623
Leslie will be running it.

02:07.694 --> 02:09.924
And we need one more.

02:09.996 --> 02:11.486
Who wants in?

02:16.436 --> 02:17.698
Tom.

02:17.770 --> 02:19.067
Fine.

02:19.606 --> 02:21.665
<i>This is a great thing</i>
<i>for you guys to see.</i>

02:21.741 --> 02:23.834
This is where the rubber of government

02:23.910 --> 02:27.141
meets the road
of actual human beings.

02:27.580 --> 02:29.980
When I go through these doors,
I need to be on.

02:30.049 --> 02:32.984
Like the White House Press Secretary.
Are you ready?

02:33.052 --> 02:34.451
Yeah.
Okay.

02:34.521 --> 02:36.011
Here we go.

02:37.724 --> 02:39.123
It's locked.

02:40.360 --> 02:42.726
Okay.
Here we go.

02:50.003 --> 02:53.461
<i>Thank you so much for coming.</i>
<i>What an amazing turnout.</i>

02:54.007 --> 02:55.099
<i>My name is</i>
<i>Leslie Knope.</i>

02:55.175 --> 02:58.406
<i>I am the deputy director of the</i>
<i>Parks and Recreation Department,</i>

02:58.478 --> 03:02.881
<i>and tonight we're gonna be taking</i>
<i>some of your questions as... Hello?</i>

03:04.184 --> 03:06.482
<i>We're having</i>
<i>a meeting in here.</i>

03:10.056 --> 03:12.286
<i>Does anybody have any</i>
<i>questions about permits?</i>

03:12.959 --> 03:15.189
So, take two.

03:15.261 --> 03:19.061
I'm Leslie Knope, and with me is
department member Tom Haverford.

03:19.132 --> 03:22.829
We are here to answer any and all
of your questions, so fire away.

03:22.902 --> 03:26.929
Well, it's a great day,
because last month they put me in jail.

03:27.006 --> 03:32.808
That's right. The head of the
police is a ninth-degree Mason.

03:32.879 --> 03:35.370
But the music
is so loud.

03:35.448 --> 03:37.916
Stop the graffiti,
please. Please.

03:37.984 --> 03:40.282
I don't like obscenities
just as much as you don't like them.

03:40.353 --> 03:41.684
No, it drives me
crazy. I have kids.

03:41.754 --> 03:42.778
Right. But...

03:42.855 --> 03:44.117
I've got my little
three-year-old,

03:44.190 --> 03:45.714
I'm going through the
park and someone's like,

03:45.792 --> 03:47.089
"Hey my"

03:47.160 --> 03:49.424
And the guy's, "You my,
you head."

03:49.495 --> 03:51.190
These people are
members of a community

03:51.264 --> 03:52.856
that care about
where they live,

03:52.932 --> 03:56.265
<i>so what I hear when I'm being yelled at</i>

03:56.336 --> 03:59.237
is people caring
loudly at me.

03:59.772 --> 04:03.003
Now, I have a few things I
want to say about Laura Linney.

04:03.076 --> 04:05.670
Thank you so much, Barry.
Always great to have you here.

04:05.745 --> 04:07.474
Anyone else who would
like to contribute?

04:07.547 --> 04:08.571
Hi. Hi, hi.

04:08.648 --> 04:09.979
Hi. I'm Ann Perkins.

04:10.049 --> 04:15.419
I'm a nurse, and frankly,
I don't really care for politics,

04:21.861 --> 04:25.592
but I'm here to talk about the
abandoned lot on Sullivan Street.

04:25.665 --> 04:27.462
Excellent. That sounds like a good idea.
Tell us about that.

04:27.533 --> 04:30.593
No, it's a problem.
It almost killed my boyfriend.

04:30.670 --> 04:31.762
Oh.
Yeah.

04:31.838 --> 04:33.738
There's a lot
nearby my house,

04:33.806 --> 04:37.003
and a developer dug out a
basement for some condos,

04:37.076 --> 04:38.566
and then
they went bankrupt,

04:38.645 --> 04:41.614
so there's just
this giant pit,

04:41.681 --> 04:43.512
and it's been there
for almost a year.

04:43.583 --> 04:45.210
Twelve months,
yes. Go on.

04:45.285 --> 04:50.086
Yeah, and my boyfriend, who is a
musician, actually, I support him,

04:50.156 --> 04:53.785
but anyway, he fell in
and broke both his legs.

04:53.860 --> 04:55.157
Ann, let me speak
with you for a minute.

04:55.228 --> 04:58.129
So, your boyfriend fell
down into this pit, right?

04:58.197 --> 04:59.221
Yes.

04:59.299 --> 05:03.998
And, this guy, is it pretty serious?
Are you guys living together?

05:04.070 --> 05:05.765
Yes.
Wow,

05:05.838 --> 05:07.271
I'm sure this must be
really tough for you.

05:07.340 --> 05:10.707
You know, just, this guy, sounds like
he didn't have a lot going on for him

05:10.777 --> 05:13.041
to start with, and now
both legs broken.

05:13.112 --> 05:15.672
He's just weak.
You have to take care of him.

05:15.748 --> 05:17.306
You probably feel like
you need to move on.

05:17.383 --> 05:19.283
What does this...
Just become more adventurous

05:19.352 --> 05:20.979
in relationships
with your body, just in...

05:21.054 --> 05:24.319
Are you actually
hitting on me right now?

05:24.390 --> 05:27.188
Oh. Oh. God, no. I'm not hitting on you.
I'm actually married.

05:27.260 --> 05:30.559
I'm just an open person,
and I like connecting with people.

05:30.630 --> 05:33.531
I'm, you know, very comfortable
around women, attractive women.

05:33.599 --> 05:36.727
I've spent a lot of time with them.
And I just... I don't know.

05:36.803 --> 05:38.828
I feel like we might be taking
up too much of the forum's time.

05:38.905 --> 05:41.499
Maybe we can just
exchange numbers.

05:41.574 --> 05:44.771
You know, maybe go away one weekend
and just kind of talk about this.

05:44.844 --> 05:46.436
Look...
I'd love to do it.

05:46.512 --> 05:50.778
The bottom line is I've been trying
to get this thing fixed for months,

05:50.850 --> 05:53.614
and nobody's done anything,
and it's ugly, and it's dangerous,

05:53.686 --> 05:55.153
and it's
government-owned,

05:55.221 --> 05:57.280
and you need to do
something about it.

06:03.062 --> 06:04.222
Okay.

06:05.565 --> 06:07.328
I'll do something about it.
Really?

06:07.400 --> 06:09.493
Yes, we...
I will help you.

06:09.569 --> 06:11.503
Is that a promise?

06:12.438 --> 06:15.635
It's more than a promise.
It's a pinky promise.

06:16.743 --> 06:20.702
I pinky promise all of
you that I will help,

06:21.948 --> 06:24.610
and I will go to
that location tomorrow,

06:24.684 --> 06:26.879
and we will
fill in that pit,

06:26.953 --> 06:32.084
and then when that's done,
we're gonna put a park on the land.

06:35.161 --> 06:36.150
Okay.

06:40.733 --> 06:42.530
<i>Well, I've worked at the</i>
<i>Parks Department for six years,</i>

06:42.602 --> 06:44.763
<i>and I've handled a lot of</i>
<i>things that I'm proud of.</i>

06:44.837 --> 06:46.896
Recently, I led
a city-wide drive

06:46.973 --> 06:48.634
to disinfect
the sandbox sand

06:48.708 --> 06:51.575
after we had those
problems with the cats.

06:52.211 --> 06:54.111
<i>But this pit,</i>

06:54.180 --> 06:57.377
the chance to build a whole
new park from scratch,

06:59.152 --> 07:01.347
this could be
my Hoover Dam.

07:04.657 --> 07:05.919
No,
that sounds great.

07:05.992 --> 07:09.894
Problem is,
anything over $25 I have to report,

07:09.962 --> 07:14.399
so maybe give my wife a call
and give her the suits,

07:14.467 --> 07:17.231
and then if they don't fit her,
maybe she'll give them to me.

07:18.471 --> 07:19.733
Morning.

07:20.807 --> 07:23.776
All right,
Mr. Mayor. That sounds good.

07:23.843 --> 07:26.641
I'll see you on Saturday for
the Ultimate Frisbee game.

07:26.712 --> 07:27.701
Bye.

07:28.347 --> 07:29.974
Leslie, hello.

07:30.049 --> 07:31.539
You were talking
to the mayor?

07:31.617 --> 07:34.552
Yep, we were just rapping
about some things.

07:34.620 --> 07:38.215
Tom and I work really well together.
We're both outsiders.

07:38.291 --> 07:41.852
I'm a woman, he's a...
I think he's a Libyan.

07:42.328 --> 07:44.558
I am from Bennettsville,
South Carolina.

07:44.630 --> 07:47.064
I am what you might call
a redneck.

07:47.133 --> 07:49.795
Okay, brainstorm.
How do we make this park happen?

07:49.869 --> 07:51.166
Let's go to
the city council directly

07:51.237 --> 07:52.261
and ask them
to put up the money.

07:52.338 --> 07:54.636
No, parks
are not a priority.

07:54.707 --> 07:57.938
I need more firepower.
I need bigger guns.

07:58.010 --> 08:00.672
You know what I need to do?
Form a committee. Right?

08:00.746 --> 08:02.873
Yeah, that could work.
Yeah, 'cause committees are power,

08:02.949 --> 08:04.507
and committees
make things happen.

08:04.584 --> 08:08.111
Committees are the lifeblood
of our democratic system.

08:08.187 --> 08:09.711
That's really good.
Write that down.

08:09.789 --> 08:10.915
Yep.

08:10.990 --> 08:13.857
From time to time, when I think
of an eloquent saying or a phrase,

08:13.926 --> 08:15.188
I have Tom write it down.

08:15.261 --> 08:16.888
He's collecting them
for my memoirs.

08:16.963 --> 08:19.591
Here's Leslie's quote
from Wednesday.

08:20.233 --> 08:21.894
Okay, read it
back to me.

08:21.968 --> 08:23.230
Um...

08:24.170 --> 08:27.037
"Committees cover our
democracy with blood."

08:27.106 --> 08:28.198
Hmm.

08:30.176 --> 08:32.542
Sounded better
when I said it.

08:32.611 --> 08:34.375
It's still good, though.

08:34.447 --> 08:38.405
Okay, I have an idea.
What about bringing Mark on board?

08:38.484 --> 08:40.349
Which Mark?
Which Mark?

08:40.785 --> 08:43.778
Mark Brendanawicz.
Which Mark?

08:43.856 --> 08:45.118
Well, if you want something
done in this town,

08:45.191 --> 08:46.556
you call Mark Brendanawicz

08:46.626 --> 08:49.060
because, you know, he's a city planner,
but he's more than that.

08:49.128 --> 08:51.096
He's kind of like a fixer.
He fixes things.

08:51.163 --> 08:54.758
He's a smart, capable guy.

08:54.834 --> 08:57.769
He just... He knows where
the bodies are buried.

08:57.837 --> 09:01.102
What's up, Brendanawicz?
You crazy old Polish person.

09:02.308 --> 09:05.243
<i>City Hall is like a locker room,</i>
<i>and you gotta get in there,</i>

09:05.311 --> 09:07.802
and you gotta snap
towels at people,

09:07.880 --> 09:10.815
and you gotta give them the business,
and if you can't take it,

09:10.883 --> 09:13.078
you know, you...
Then you can't take it.

09:13.152 --> 09:15.586
You gotta leave
the locker room.

09:16.622 --> 09:17.680
Let's get down
to brass tacks.

09:17.757 --> 09:18.985
I know you don't
have a lot of time

09:19.058 --> 09:22.221
and I want to thank you
for meeting me today.

09:22.295 --> 09:23.626
I just work right there.

09:23.696 --> 09:25.357
Well, thank you for
clearing your schedule.

09:25.431 --> 09:26.625
I didn't
clear anything.

09:26.699 --> 09:28.462
You know this lot that
I'm talking about, right?

09:28.534 --> 09:30.764
Yeah, Lot 48.

09:30.836 --> 09:34.602
Condo developer. He dug a basement,
and then he went bankrupt.

09:34.674 --> 09:37.768
I checked it out like a month ago.
It's pretty gross.

09:37.843 --> 09:39.902
What would you say
if I told you

09:39.979 --> 09:43.380
that I was thinking about
turning it into a park?

09:43.449 --> 09:46.475
A park, huh? Okay.

09:46.552 --> 09:48.645
Well, when I think
about the logistics,

09:48.721 --> 09:51.519
the various hoops that you're
gonna have to jump through,

09:51.591 --> 09:57.086
I would say, is it likely?
No, it's not likely, you know.

09:57.163 --> 10:01.031
But, is it possible?

10:01.701 --> 10:04.101
No. It's not possible.

10:04.170 --> 10:05.228
I would give up
on that one.

10:05.304 --> 10:06.498
What? Why?

10:06.572 --> 10:09.905
Why? I don't know.
There's like a million reasons why.

10:09.976 --> 10:12.376
Homeowners <i>'</i> associations,
anti-government nuts,

10:12.445 --> 10:14.379
bureaucrats,
miles of red tape...

10:14.447 --> 10:16.472
Really? It sounds like you're
telling me to go for it.

10:16.549 --> 10:17.982
There's no way
it can happen.

10:18.050 --> 10:21.349
I can do this.
I just need a little help.

10:22.655 --> 10:26.489
Could you do me a favor,
for old times <i>'</i> sake?

10:29.996 --> 10:33.124
Mark and I...
It's complicated.

10:33.833 --> 10:37.667
When you work closely with someone
and you share similar interests

10:37.737 --> 10:40.205
<i>and you have</i>
<i>a similar world view</i>

10:40.272 --> 10:44.106
and you're passionate about the
same things, things can happen.

10:46.045 --> 10:47.808
We slept together.

10:48.147 --> 10:50.172
Leslie? No.

10:54.153 --> 10:56.917
Oh, my God.
You know what?

10:56.989 --> 10:59.457
Yeah, we did, like,
five years ago. I sort of...

11:01.961 --> 11:05.328
No, but yeah.
Yeah, we did.

11:05.731 --> 11:07.699
Honey, can you straighten
up your area a little bit?

11:07.767 --> 11:10.167
'Cause they're
gonna be here soon.

11:10.236 --> 11:13.399
Can... Thanks.

11:13.472 --> 11:15.303
That parks lady
is coming over,

11:15.374 --> 11:18.104
and we're gonna go
take a look at the pit.

11:18.177 --> 11:21.169
<i>I think it's probably</i>
<i>just a photo op for her.</i>

11:21.247 --> 11:23.579
<i>I mean, I don't think anybody in</i>
<i>government actually cares about...</i>

11:23.649 --> 11:25.810
Honey, do you mind doing
that somewhere else?

11:25.885 --> 11:27.546
I'm trying to watch TV.

11:27.620 --> 11:29.417
I'm talking about
the pit you fell in.

11:30.623 --> 11:32.614
It's Ms. Perkins <i>'</i> house.

11:35.661 --> 11:36.821
Doorbell!

11:36.896 --> 11:38.227
Yeah, I heard it.

11:41.133 --> 11:42.122
Doorbell!

11:42.201 --> 11:43.930
I heard it.
I'm getting it.

11:45.638 --> 11:47.765
I'm here.
Hey! Wow!

11:47.840 --> 11:49.671
Look at that.
Safety.

11:49.742 --> 11:51.209
You remember Tom
from last night.

11:51.277 --> 11:52.767
Hey, Ann, how are you?
Yeah, hey. Of course I do.

11:52.845 --> 11:54.540
And this is our college intern, April.

11:54.613 --> 11:56.945
She's going to be documenting
our fact-finding mission.

11:57.016 --> 11:58.278
Hey, April.
Hey.

11:58.350 --> 12:00.113
Is this fun for you?

12:00.186 --> 12:01.744
Yeah, it's so much fun.

12:01.821 --> 12:04.847
I'm just gonna grab my phone quickly.
Sorry.

12:08.661 --> 12:10.595
This must be our hero.

12:11.564 --> 12:13.395
The man heard
'round the world.

12:13.466 --> 12:14.797
Uh-huh.

12:14.867 --> 12:16.095
How you doing, son?

12:16.168 --> 12:17.294
Pretty good.

12:17.369 --> 12:19.030
I'm Leslie Knope.

12:19.972 --> 12:24.705
And the entire government of
Pawnee would like to let you know

12:24.777 --> 12:27.769
that we will do everything
we can to help you.

12:27.847 --> 12:29.314
Could you pass me
my itch stick?

12:29.381 --> 12:30.814
Of course.

12:45.397 --> 12:48.924
So, Andy jumped
over this fence.

12:49.001 --> 12:53.438
He was crossing through to get home,
and then he fell right there.

12:53.506 --> 12:56.703
Oh, my God.
How did we let this happen?

12:58.277 --> 12:59.938
Dream with me
for a second, Ann.

13:00.012 --> 13:03.470
Doesn't this neighborhood
deserve a first-class park?

13:03.582 --> 13:07.985
Imagine a shiny new playground
with a jungle gym and swings,

13:08.053 --> 13:12.422
pool, tennis courts,
volleyball courts, racquetball courts,

13:12.491 --> 13:14.686
basketball court,
regulation football field.

13:14.760 --> 13:17.923
We could put an amphitheatre over
there with Shakespeare in the Park.

13:17.997 --> 13:19.555
It's really not
that big of a pit.

13:19.632 --> 13:22.032
We could do
some of those things.

13:22.101 --> 13:26.367
It's gonna take a little extra work.
But why not try?

13:27.540 --> 13:29.132
I think that
would be great.

13:29.208 --> 13:30.470
Me, too.

13:31.410 --> 13:32.707
I'm going in.

13:32.778 --> 13:34.712
Why? Don't worry.
I have a hard hat on.

13:34.780 --> 13:36.441
I can see that, but...
Yeah.

13:36.515 --> 13:38.005
April, document this.
Document what?

13:38.083 --> 13:39.345
The key to any
fact-finding mission

13:39.418 --> 13:42.581
is to get right into
the battle zone, you know?

13:42.655 --> 13:44.987
It's like George Bush
when he flew over New Orleans

13:45.057 --> 13:48.322
or Richard Nixon
when he went to China

13:48.394 --> 13:51.227
to see what the Chinese
were up to. No!

13:55.234 --> 13:57.134
Leslie, are you okay?

14:00.673 --> 14:04.109
Leslie! Hold on, April's gonna
get some photos for the website.

14:04.176 --> 14:05.302
Could you
just be still?

14:05.377 --> 14:07.402
Don't move around
as much.

14:07.479 --> 14:10.209
Okay, squeeze
my fingers. Good.

14:12.718 --> 14:14.310
Does it hurt a lot?
No.

14:14.386 --> 14:16.081
Mmm-mmm.
I'm fine.

14:16.589 --> 14:17.783
No, you're not.

14:17.857 --> 14:20.087
Good thing I was
wearing that hard hat.

14:20.159 --> 14:21.786
But it...
It fell off.

14:22.595 --> 14:24.460
After my head
hit that rod.

14:25.831 --> 14:26.889
Wow.

14:26.966 --> 14:28.957
I can't believe you fell in, too.
That's awesome.

14:29.034 --> 14:30.661
It's not
awesome, Andy.

14:30.736 --> 14:33.762
Well, at least my boss will listen
to me now that I broke my clavicle.

14:33.839 --> 14:35.830
It's not broken.
It is.

14:36.342 --> 14:40.108
Do you have one of those neck
foam collar brace things?

14:40.179 --> 14:41.840
Honestly,
you're fine.

14:41.914 --> 14:44.382
Honestly,
my clavicle's broken.

14:45.818 --> 14:47.080
Oh, hey, baby,
if you're going to the kitchen,

14:47.152 --> 14:49.211
could you make me
pancakes real quick?

14:49.288 --> 14:50.585
Sure.

14:50.656 --> 14:52.886
Ooh! Are pancakes
being made?

14:54.059 --> 14:55.686
Thank you.
Sure.

14:57.463 --> 15:00.921
I don't know, she's a little doofy,
but she's sweet.

15:04.436 --> 15:06.063
<i>Ron, please.</i>

15:06.138 --> 15:07.366
No. No way.

15:07.439 --> 15:10.067
Come on, Ron.
I've been a loyal foot soldier.

15:10.142 --> 15:13.578
Give me my shot.
Let me have Lot 48.

15:14.346 --> 15:16.678
Is that a travel pillow
around your neck?

15:16.749 --> 15:18.944
Ron, I don't know
how to explain this to you.

15:19.018 --> 15:22.112
When you've been down in the pit...
Have you been in the pit?

15:22.187 --> 15:24.121
No, I haven't gotten
down there yet.

15:24.189 --> 15:25.213
Well, I have.

15:25.291 --> 15:26.280
When you fell in.

15:26.358 --> 15:30.522
When I visited the bottom of the
pit on a fact-finding mission.

15:31.130 --> 15:36.932
And when you're down there, you get some
perspective about what it all means.

15:37.336 --> 15:39.600
And let me
tell you something, Ron.

15:39.672 --> 15:44.041
What it means is
I want this subcommittee.

15:46.445 --> 15:48.379
I've been quite open about
this around the office.

15:48.447 --> 15:51.416
I don't want this Parks
Department to build any parks

15:51.483 --> 15:53.110
because I don't
believe in government.

15:53.185 --> 15:57.519
I think that all government
is a waste of taxpayer money.

15:57.589 --> 16:02.322
My dream is to have the
park system privatized

16:02.528 --> 16:05.520
and run entirely for profit
by corporations.

16:06.365 --> 16:08.196
Like Chuck E. Cheese.

16:08.901 --> 16:10.732
They have an impeccable
business model.

16:10.803 --> 16:12.998
I would rather work
for Chuck E. Cheese.

16:13.072 --> 16:16.235
Well, I will definitely
think about it.

16:16.976 --> 16:18.409
I like the sound
of that definitely.

16:18.477 --> 16:21.412
I'm gonna leave before
you change your mind.

16:31.323 --> 16:35.953
Mr. Swanson, I presume.
Lot 48. Thoughts? Yes? No? Me?

16:36.028 --> 16:37.325
Park? Giving
the park to me?

16:37.396 --> 16:38.454
Still mulling.

16:38.530 --> 16:39.895
<i>She's insatiable.</i>

16:39.965 --> 16:44.368
She's like a little dog
with a chew toy.

16:44.436 --> 16:46.427
All right, you guys. All right,
all right. I'll ask him.

16:46.505 --> 16:48.132
Everybody wants to know
what your decision is.

16:48.207 --> 16:50.072
Someone on the phone
about the park.

16:50.142 --> 16:52.906
You know,
I don't think I even want it.

16:54.179 --> 16:57.376
Oh. Man, my clavicle's
still really hurting me.

17:01.954 --> 17:03.421
Oh! This is
a great shot.

17:03.489 --> 17:05.150
I know.
That's awesome.

17:05.223 --> 17:07.749
I think she's crying in that one.
Look at this one.

17:07.826 --> 17:09.292
Hey, kids.
That's another good one.

17:09.361 --> 17:11.261
Hey.
Hey, Brendanawicz.

17:11.329 --> 17:12.854
You gotta come
check this out.

17:12.931 --> 17:14.865
Leslie took us out
to that pit in Lot 48,

17:14.933 --> 17:16.366
and she fell inside.

17:16.435 --> 17:17.834
And we have some awesome photos.
One.

17:17.903 --> 17:19.700
Is she okay?
Yeah, she's fine.

17:19.771 --> 17:20.761
Oh! This is a classic.

17:21.440 --> 17:22.498
That's the best one.

17:22.574 --> 17:25.202
The up-skirt photo.
Awesome.

17:27.945 --> 17:32.076
Hey, man. Give me the photo back.
What's going on?

17:33.485 --> 17:34.952
Don't worry.
I can print more.

17:36.822 --> 17:39.154
Leslie is unique.

17:40.059 --> 17:43.051
<i>Government work</i>
<i>can beat you down.</i>

17:43.128 --> 17:47.792
<i>I would say that I lost my optimism</i>
<i>about government in about two months.</i>

17:48.534 --> 17:50.968
Leslie's kept hers
for six years.

17:51.770 --> 17:55.365
I've got a few rules about how to
survive and prosper in a government job,

17:55.441 --> 17:58.672
and I think I'm about to
break one of those rules.

18:00.045 --> 18:01.774
I want you to give
Lot 48 to Leslie

18:01.847 --> 18:03.838
so she can try
to build a park.

18:05.684 --> 18:06.810
Why should I?

18:06.885 --> 18:08.876
You owe me one,
remember?

18:08.954 --> 18:11.252
Do you want to
cash in for this?

18:11.957 --> 18:13.584
Yeah, I do.

18:14.193 --> 18:17.890
<i>So this was built in 1935.</i>
<i>It's called Pioneer Hall.</i>

18:18.430 --> 18:19.829
<i>And a little trivia,</i>

18:19.898 --> 18:23.129
<i>it is one of the first structures</i>
<i>in America to ever have locks.</i>

18:23.769 --> 18:24.758
Wow!

18:24.837 --> 18:26.964
Oh, yeah.
This is our crown jewel.

18:27.039 --> 18:28.438
It's one of
our best murals.

18:28.507 --> 18:31.670
It depicts the very famous
battle at Conega Creek.

18:31.743 --> 18:33.176
We have a lot of
children visit,

18:33.245 --> 18:37.739
so often we have to cover up the
more gruesome parts with a poster.

18:38.117 --> 18:40.517
That is horrifying.

18:40.586 --> 18:42.144
Yes, it is.

18:43.522 --> 18:45.854
So, what do you want to see?
The DMV? Animal control?

18:45.924 --> 18:47.721
Or we could...
Leslie!

18:52.064 --> 18:55.192
We did it.
Ron's approved our committee.

18:55.601 --> 18:57.626
Oh, my God.
That's great!

18:57.703 --> 18:59.603
That's so great.
That's so exciting!

18:59.671 --> 19:01.195
This is huge.

19:01.273 --> 19:02.706
I'm barely 34,

19:02.774 --> 19:06.175
and I've already landed a Parks
Department exploratory subcommittee.

19:06.245 --> 19:08.736
I'm a rocket ship.

19:08.814 --> 19:11.248
Leslie. I just heard the news.
Hey.

19:11.316 --> 19:12.806
Isn't it great?
Congratulations.

19:12.885 --> 19:15.581
Thank you. I'm so excited.
It's exciting, isn't it?

19:15.654 --> 19:16.643
It is.
Yeah.

19:16.722 --> 19:17.848
Should I call a press
conference now, or...

19:17.923 --> 19:19.185
Yeah, call one. Definitely.
I would.

19:19.258 --> 19:21.453
Every now and then we have
these little gatherings,

19:21.527 --> 19:24.587
and Leslie gets plastered.

19:24.663 --> 19:28.258
<i>One time I convinced her to try</i>
<i>to fax someone a Fruit Roll-Up.</i>

19:28.333 --> 19:32.895
<i>She one time made out with the</i>
<i>water-delivery guy in her office.</i>

19:32.971 --> 19:35.872
<i>On Halloween,</i>
<i>she was dressed up as Batman.</i>

19:35.974 --> 19:37.942
<i>Not Batgirl. Batman.</i>

19:38.010 --> 19:41.810
<i>And I convinced her to go stop a</i>
<i>crime that was going on outside.</i>

19:41.880 --> 19:44.405
And it is my favorite thing
in the world.

19:44.483 --> 19:46.451
You know what?
America is awesome.

19:46.518 --> 19:49.544
<i>It's so full of hope</i>
<i>and small towns</i>

19:49.621 --> 19:51.953
<i>and big cities</i>
<i>and real people</i>

19:52.024 --> 19:54.652
and delicious beverages
and hot guys.

19:55.227 --> 19:57.320
You just never know when
opportunity is gonna strike.

19:57.396 --> 19:58.624
Yeah.
You gotta be ready for it.

19:58.697 --> 19:59.823
Yeah.
Are you excited?

19:59.898 --> 20:01.092
Definitely am.
Fired up.

20:01.166 --> 20:02.633
Yeah!
I'm really fired up.

20:02.701 --> 20:05.295
I... You know they say
that democracy or whatever

20:05.370 --> 20:08.931
only works when people get involved?
Well, I'm getting involved.

20:09.007 --> 20:12.204
So I am gonna
make a vow now

20:12.277 --> 20:16.111
that I will do whatever it
takes to get this pit filled in.

20:16.181 --> 20:18.012
Even if it takes
two months.

20:19.184 --> 20:23.416
<i>Soul sista, soul sista
Gonna get your phone, sista</i>

20:23.488 --> 20:29.256
Yeah.
<i>Sweet Lady Marmalard</i>

20:30.729 --> 20:33.289
I've created this office
as a symbol

20:33.365 --> 20:35.128
of how I feel
about government.

20:35.200 --> 20:38.863
This sawed-off shotgun
belonged to a local bootlegger.

20:38.937 --> 20:41.497
People who come in here
to ask me for things

20:41.573 --> 20:43.700
have to stare
right down the barrel.

20:43.775 --> 20:46.266
Did you guys get
a grant to do this?

20:46.345 --> 20:48.006
This is my basketball court.

20:48.080 --> 20:49.775
I don't want to see
any double dribble.

20:49.848 --> 20:52.373
I don't want to see
any three-second violations.

20:52.451 --> 20:53.645
Bobby Knight!
