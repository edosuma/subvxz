01:07.469 --> 01:12.429
<i>Only time can teach us
what is truth and what is legend.</i>

01:13.475 --> 01:16.706
<i>Some truths do not survive the ages.</i>

01:16.879 --> 01:20.872
<i>But the legend of the child
with the blue eyes will live forever...</i>

01:21.050 --> 01:25.510
<i>... and be whispered in all four winds
of the Great White Mountains.</i>

01:26.555 --> 01:31.390
<i>We, the Yagahl, were hunters
of the mightiest of all beasts...</i>

01:31.560 --> 01:33.187
<i>... the Mannak.</i>

01:33.562 --> 01:35.587
<i>But our world began to change.</i>

01:36.231 --> 01:39.291
<i>The Mannaks came later and later
to our valley...</i>

01:39.501 --> 01:42.993
<i>... and there were times
when they did not come at all.</i>

01:43.205 --> 01:45.230
<i>Our hunters grew restless.</i>

01:45.407 --> 01:48.467
<i>And our people grew hungry.</i>

01:52.081 --> 01:53.912
<i>Only one amongst us...</i>

01:54.083 --> 01:58.315
<i>... the one we call "Old Mother,"
the last of her kind...</i>

01:58.520 --> 02:01.921
<i>... only she could speak
to the spirits of the earth...</i>

02:02.091 --> 02:05.583
<i>... and ask the wisdom of the Fathers
to save our people.</i>

02:11.633 --> 02:14.295
<i>Many times she asks...</i>

02:14.536 --> 02:20.304
<i>... until one night they answered her call
and sent us a sign.</i>

02:23.445 --> 02:27.779
<i>A sign of the beginning of the end.</i>

02:27.950 --> 02:32.046
We found her in the mountains.
She was holding on to a dead woman.

03:01.583 --> 03:03.141
The Fathers have sent her.

03:24.473 --> 03:30.002
She came to tell us
of four-legged demons...

03:30.179 --> 03:33.671
...that will put an end to our world.

03:35.250 --> 03:40.586
They will come to our valley
at the time when...

03:41.190 --> 03:44.421
...we go on our last hunt.

03:45.494 --> 03:48.725
But do not fear.

03:49.731 --> 03:54.395
From this hunt a warrior will arise...

03:54.570 --> 03:59.166
...and this one will be his woman.

03:59.341 --> 04:02.640
They will lead us into a new life...

04:02.811 --> 04:07.976
...where the Yagahl
will know hunger no more.

04:12.154 --> 04:13.416
<i>That night...</i>

04:13.589 --> 04:17.582
<i>... Old Mother did not see the face
of the warrior of which she spoke...</i>

04:17.759 --> 04:20.226
<i>... but she knew that the child
with the blue eyes...</i>

04:20.863 --> 04:23.855
<i>... was a blessing she must protect.</i>

04:24.666 --> 04:28.227
<i>To our people, she was Evolet...</i>

04:28.403 --> 04:30.871
<i>... the promise of life.</i>

04:31.039 --> 04:35.476
<i>To a boy named D'Leh,
she was much more than that.</i>

04:51.226 --> 04:55.253
<i>Only one of the Yagahl did not believe in
Old Mother's prophecy:</i>

04:55.430 --> 04:58.126
<i>The young boy's father...</i>

04:58.300 --> 05:02.600
<i>... the one who carried the White Spear
and blew the whistle for the hunt.</i>

05:04.706 --> 05:07.300
I will watch over your son
as if he were my own.

05:09.411 --> 05:13.609
I know you will. But promise me
you will tell no one why I left.

05:19.855 --> 05:23.291
We cannot wait for the last hunt.

05:36.471 --> 05:39.304
- Good throw! Throw again!
- Good throw!

05:39.474 --> 05:41.101
Ka'ren?

05:41.476 --> 05:43.444
Ka'ren? Hmm?

05:44.179 --> 05:45.942
No. Not you.

05:47.149 --> 05:50.277
Your father abandoned our people.
Go away.

05:51.219 --> 05:52.811
Fight well!

05:52.988 --> 05:54.888
You must win, Ka'ren!

05:55.457 --> 05:56.822
Leave him!

05:56.992 --> 05:58.789
Ka'ren! I said leave him!

06:03.131 --> 06:04.291
D'Leh.

06:04.466 --> 06:06.297
He is the son of a coward.

06:06.468 --> 06:07.992
You never say that again.

06:09.671 --> 06:11.434
Any of you.

06:24.486 --> 06:26.044
Good throw.

06:29.091 --> 06:30.558
You are alone...

06:31.026 --> 06:32.857
...like me.

06:37.432 --> 06:39.161
What happened to your people?

06:40.068 --> 06:42.002
They were killed...

06:42.504 --> 06:44.495
...by four-legged demons.

06:56.551 --> 06:59.281
You will never be alone, Evolet.

07:05.727 --> 07:07.092
Do you see that light?

07:08.196 --> 07:09.823
That one?

07:09.998 --> 07:13.934
It does not move across the sky
like all the others do.

07:14.836 --> 07:17.703
That light is like you in my heart.

07:18.273 --> 07:20.537
It will never go away.

07:20.709 --> 07:22.643
It will never go away?

07:22.811 --> 07:24.870
No, never.

07:28.417 --> 07:29.975
Evolet, come here.

07:30.786 --> 07:34.244
Don't stray from the hut
without telling me.

07:37.726 --> 07:39.159
<i>And for many moons...</i>

07:39.761 --> 07:43.253
<i>... Evolet and D'Leh
looked at each other...</i>

07:43.432 --> 07:46.765
<i>... and the love in their hearts
grew stronger.</i>

07:55.777 --> 07:59.076
<i>Until finally, after many years...</i>

08:00.382 --> 08:04.978
<i>... the day of the last hunt arrived.</i>

08:06.254 --> 08:09.087
D'Leh, how long do we
have to keep watch?

08:09.257 --> 08:11.191
Until the Mannaks come.

08:12.694 --> 08:14.924
And when will they come?

08:15.097 --> 08:16.826
Do not know.

08:17.265 --> 08:18.892
D'Leh, when will I become a hunter?

08:19.067 --> 08:21.535
When you stop asking
so many questions.

08:28.210 --> 08:31.873
The Great Hunter Tic'Tic
came to Old Mother's hut today.

08:32.047 --> 08:34.708
She thinks the time of prophecy
has come.

08:34.883 --> 08:37.510
She told him not to kill
the Mannak this hunt.

08:38.186 --> 08:43.089
She thinks Ka'ren will win the White Spear
and claim Evolet.

08:45.961 --> 08:49.328
- Baku, look what I found for you.
- Ah.

08:50.365 --> 08:51.923
Mm.

08:52.534 --> 08:54.832
You know what a good hunter Ka'ren is.

08:55.003 --> 08:58.370
We must run away. Together,
we can cross the Great Mountains.

08:58.540 --> 09:02.306
And abandon our people? Like my father?

09:02.644 --> 09:04.635
I cannot do that.

09:06.681 --> 09:09.548
I worked on this for many moons.

09:12.220 --> 09:17.658
The only way we can be together
is I must kill the Mannak.

09:29.070 --> 09:32.005
They are here! They are here! Look!

09:36.411 --> 09:38.276
Look how many there are.

10:08.376 --> 10:09.968
Today...

10:10.378 --> 10:15.611
...I will not pierce the heart of the Mannak.
It will be one of you.

10:15.784 --> 10:18.617
One of you will claim the White Spear.

10:18.787 --> 10:20.482
May the Fathers of the Yagahl...

10:20.655 --> 10:25.456
...and the spirit of the mighty Mannak
choose the best of you.

10:27.395 --> 10:29.329
Ka'ren, you have the first throw.

10:29.497 --> 10:32.762
Ka'ren, the Mannak is yours.
You will be our leader.

10:36.938 --> 10:39.907
D'Leh? What about you?

10:41.409 --> 10:44.378
I hunt to win Evolet.

10:46.147 --> 10:49.446
We hunt together as one!

11:24.352 --> 11:26.582
Tic'Tic found the lead bull.

12:19.674 --> 12:21.073
Slow down!

12:22.243 --> 12:24.040
D'Leh!

12:31.286 --> 12:34.119
They're breaking away! Bring them back!

12:58.213 --> 13:01.740
Baku! They're coming!
They're coming, Baku!

13:02.450 --> 13:05.681
They're coming! They're coming!

13:19.934 --> 13:23.131
The last one is coming! It is a big bull!

13:24.739 --> 13:26.297
Now!

13:48.263 --> 13:51.630
D'Leh is coming!
Ka'ren, make your throw!

14:00.375 --> 14:02.434
Keep him down! Hold the net!

14:15.657 --> 14:17.784
He is too strong! Let go, Ka'ren!

14:18.793 --> 14:20.727
D'Leh, we have to let go!

14:20.895 --> 14:23.125
I can't! My hand is caught!

15:57.759 --> 15:58.817
Look! Look!

15:59.360 --> 16:00.384
It's D'Leh!

16:08.736 --> 16:10.601
You killed him! All alone!

16:10.772 --> 16:12.672
No one has ever done that.

16:14.676 --> 16:16.109
That was brave.

16:21.416 --> 16:24.078
D'Leh killed the Mannak!
He did not let go of the net!

16:24.252 --> 16:26.243
He was the only one!

16:29.691 --> 16:31.852
What are you waiting for?

16:32.794 --> 16:35.854
Wise Spirit, I killed the Mannak.

16:36.331 --> 16:39.858
I claim the White Spear...

16:40.201 --> 16:42.135
...and with it my woman...

16:43.004 --> 16:44.699
...Evolet.

16:54.682 --> 17:00.086
<i>From that day on, D'Leh was no longer
the son of a coward.</i>

17:00.254 --> 17:03.280
<i>Now the Yagahl would honor his name...</i>

17:03.458 --> 17:09.226
<i>... for bringing to them the blessings
of the Mannak for one last time.</i>

17:09.696 --> 17:15.693
<i>And though Old Mother was pleased
in her heart to see Evolet so happy...</i>

17:16.137 --> 17:18.401
<i>... she feared in her soul...</i>

17:18.573 --> 17:21.872
<i>... that the one who had slayed
the mighty beast...</i>

17:22.042 --> 17:26.173
<i>... did not have the courage
for what was to come.</i>

17:38.860 --> 17:41.761
Why does Tic'Tic not celebrate with us?

17:46.868 --> 17:49.860
- D'Leh?
- There is something I must do.

18:06.087 --> 18:07.952
What do you want?

18:13.361 --> 18:14.919
I was not brave.

18:15.530 --> 18:18.124
And I did not hunt as one.

18:19.367 --> 18:23.030
The Fathers of the Yagahl
played with us today.

18:23.204 --> 18:24.432
What should I do?

18:24.605 --> 18:27.597
If I give up the White Spear,
I give up Evolet. I cannot do that.

18:28.042 --> 18:30.476
Is she yours to give up?

18:30.712 --> 18:32.179
Hmm?

18:34.115 --> 18:38.984
It is not the way of the Yagahl
to claim the White Spear with a lie.

19:01.609 --> 19:04.009
I gave the White Spear back to Tic'Tic.

19:04.946 --> 19:06.971
Why would you do such a thing?

19:07.181 --> 19:10.150
Because I did not kill the Mannak, Evolet.

19:10.318 --> 19:13.810
- Of course you did, you held on to the net.
- No, I lied.

19:17.258 --> 19:22.628
I tried to let go like all the others.
My hand was caught in it.

19:23.664 --> 19:27.259
After that, the Mannak ran into my spear.

19:28.069 --> 19:29.502
I did nothing.

19:33.307 --> 19:38.176
Evolet, remember what I told you
about our light?

19:39.313 --> 19:41.781
I still feel the same.

19:43.885 --> 19:46.683
You will always be in my heart.

19:47.288 --> 19:49.654
That will never go away.

19:52.426 --> 19:54.451
But still...

19:55.196 --> 19:57.289
...you gave me up.

20:12.313 --> 20:17.250
<i>That night the great white rain
came to the valley of the Yagahl.</i>

20:17.418 --> 20:21.582
<i>And like an icy veil,
sadness fell over D'Leh's heart.</i>

20:26.227 --> 20:30.664
<i>And with the white rain
came the four-legged demons.</i>

20:51.385 --> 20:52.750
You stay here.

21:16.310 --> 21:17.902
Baku.

21:37.398 --> 21:39.298
Moha! Look out!

22:01.022 --> 22:03.354
- Baku, hide.
- Yes, Mother.

22:35.456 --> 22:36.855
D'Leh!

22:37.558 --> 22:39.526
We cannot help them!

22:59.180 --> 23:00.704
Please.

23:03.250 --> 23:04.547
Let me!

23:06.721 --> 23:07.745
Let me go!

23:47.962 --> 23:50.260
- What are you doing?
- I am going after them.

23:50.431 --> 23:53.594
Over the Great Mountains?
That is not possible.

23:53.768 --> 23:55.565
They came over the Great Mountains.

23:55.736 --> 23:57.761
They are demons. Maybe they can fly.

23:57.938 --> 23:59.565
I did not see wings on them.

23:59.740 --> 24:02.436
You think you can bring them down
all alone? Only you?

24:02.610 --> 24:03.634
He is not alone.

24:04.945 --> 24:06.640
I go with him.

24:08.115 --> 24:10.583
Without the other hunters,
we all will die.

24:11.352 --> 24:12.717
I will go too.

24:12.887 --> 24:16.414
No, Baku, you will stay here.

24:16.590 --> 24:19.559
But you, Ka'ren, you must go with them.

24:31.439 --> 24:32.667
Don't touch me!

24:48.389 --> 24:53.520
<i>And as they bid farewell to the elders
and the children of our people...</i>

24:54.495 --> 24:59.762
<i>... the Wise Spirit of the Yagahl blessed them
and the spears by their side.</i>

24:59.934 --> 25:04.030
<i>Old Mother knew they would
never be hunters again...</i>

25:04.205 --> 25:06.298
<i>... but warriors instead.</i>

25:23.023 --> 25:25.184
It will be night soon. We stay here.

25:25.359 --> 25:27.293
No, we go on. We are getting closer.

25:27.461 --> 25:30.123
I cannot see in the dark. Can you?

25:30.631 --> 25:33.691
We stay here. We eat and sleep.

25:42.910 --> 25:45.845
Why do you not carry the White Spear?

25:49.517 --> 25:51.451
Are you afraid?

25:52.553 --> 25:53.577
Answer.

25:53.754 --> 25:56.552
Ka'ren, go to sleep.

26:11.038 --> 26:13.165
Baku? Baku!

26:13.574 --> 26:15.565
What are you doing here? Go home.

26:15.776 --> 26:18.438
I can help you. I can carry a water bag.

26:18.612 --> 26:20.375
Go home!

26:20.881 --> 26:23.076
They killed my mother!

26:23.884 --> 26:25.545
He's alone.

26:28.556 --> 26:30.080
He will only slow us down.

26:31.992 --> 26:34.620
D'Leh, I'm thirsty.

27:01.755 --> 27:03.313
Fire still lives in these stones.

27:03.490 --> 27:04.980
D'Leh!

27:09.997 --> 27:12.522
She's alive. We must hurry.

27:36.123 --> 27:38.421
Why is Old Mother freezing?

27:56.153 --> 27:59.122
<i>The white rain is not a friend
to the hunter.</i>

27:59.289 --> 28:03.555
<i>It swallowed all the marks
of the stolen brothers and sisters.</i>

28:05.996 --> 28:11.696
<i>It was now up to the Fathers of the Yagahl
to guide their way.</i>

28:15.505 --> 28:19.771
<i>And they walked for many days and nights
to a faraway land...</i>

28:19.943 --> 28:22.605
<i>... where the Great Mountains ended...</i>

28:22.779 --> 28:27.546
<i>... and where the story of
the child with the blue eyes began.</i>

28:29.486 --> 28:35.083
<i>The place where the four-legged demons
killed Evolet's people.</i>

28:42.499 --> 28:45.991
We've walked for days now,
and still no marks.

28:46.169 --> 28:48.000
Maybe they do have wings.

28:48.171 --> 28:49.468
Maybe they do.

28:50.007 --> 28:52.805
But our brothers and sisters do not.

29:04.187 --> 29:06.155
Don't forget to chew.

30:16.893 --> 30:18.952
Maybe she only lost it.

30:37.280 --> 30:38.304
It is hot here.

30:39.015 --> 30:41.779
Baku. Stay close.

31:30.634 --> 31:32.124
What was that?

32:24.521 --> 32:25.749
We must free them tonight.

32:25.922 --> 32:28.755
Not tonight. This is not a good place.

32:30.193 --> 32:32.821
They know there is danger,
and they keep a good watch.

32:33.196 --> 32:34.561
We'll do the same.

32:34.731 --> 32:37.427
I will go first, then Ka'ren, then you.

32:39.402 --> 32:40.926
D'Leh.

32:41.404 --> 32:42.701
Come.

33:02.259 --> 33:04.159
I understand your pain.

33:05.161 --> 33:07.288
But you must be patient.

34:08.958 --> 34:10.358
D'Leh.

34:14.297 --> 34:16.389
I will never give you up again.

34:22.105 --> 34:23.663
This way.

34:24.808 --> 34:26.139
Come.

34:59.175 --> 35:00.642
D'Leh!

35:01.077 --> 35:02.567
Run! Run!

35:05.782 --> 35:06.976
D'Leh!

35:12.722 --> 35:14.087
This way!

35:23.199 --> 35:25.030
Over here! This way!

35:25.902 --> 35:27.096
Go! Go!

35:33.043 --> 35:34.567
Ka'ren!

36:14.718 --> 36:15.776
Run!

36:16.119 --> 36:17.143
Run!

36:18.855 --> 36:20.117
Tic'Tic!
- Go!

36:20.290 --> 36:21.587
Tic'Tic!

36:57.127 --> 36:59.652
D'Leh! Evolet! Up here!

37:19.282 --> 37:21.011
- D'Leh!
- I will lead them away.

37:21.184 --> 37:23.618
- No, do not go!
- I will come back for you.

37:23.920 --> 37:25.387
I promise.

38:45.568 --> 38:47.001
Oh, Baku.

38:49.472 --> 38:51.269
You should not be here.

39:14.564 --> 39:16.293
I think he speaks of D'Leh.

39:37.720 --> 39:41.713
D'Leh will come back.
He promised it to me.

40:23.520 --> 40:25.983
Ka'ren. Do you think he's still alive?

40:26.151 --> 40:27.446
It does not matter now.

40:27.616 --> 40:29.547
He tried to save us.

41:21.668 --> 41:25.892
Forgive me, Tic'Tic.
I should have listened to you.

41:26.063 --> 41:27.323
Do not die.

41:28.062 --> 41:30.117
I will bring you food.

42:12.822 --> 42:16.750
<i>Old Mother was watching over their journey
with all her strength...</i>

42:16.918 --> 42:20.745
<i>... and her spirit stayed always
by their side.</i>

42:24.644 --> 42:28.471
<i>But that night, she could not rule over
the forces of the earth...</i>

42:29.474 --> 42:32.097
<i>... and could not stop the waters
of the heavens.</i>

42:34.902 --> 42:37.365
<i>D'Leh would have to face alone...</i>

42:37.533 --> 42:41.018
<i>... the mighty beast
who rules these lands.</i>

43:00.512 --> 43:02.068
Ha! Ha!

43:49.536 --> 43:52.260
Do not eat me when I set you free!

44:55.643 --> 44:57.267
I feared you were dead.

44:57.442 --> 44:59.134
Do not fear for me.

44:59.306 --> 45:01.361
Look, over there.

45:01.705 --> 45:05.599
There was an attack.
I heard them scream.

45:06.001 --> 45:08.158
This is where they went.

46:23.498 --> 46:26.461
Tic'Tic, move away. Go.

46:30.425 --> 46:32.514
D'Leh, come back.

46:37.219 --> 46:38.877
Move away.

46:51.607 --> 46:53.832
You must remember me.

46:54.004 --> 46:55.865
I gave you life.

47:40.762 --> 47:42.659
You speak to the Spear Tooth?

47:46.690 --> 47:48.677
How do you come to speak our words?

48:19.361 --> 48:20.825
You not like Naku food?

48:23.457 --> 48:24.786
It's different, but good.

48:34.881 --> 48:36.470
We come from over the mountains.

48:36.645 --> 48:39.075
- We know where you come from.
- How do you know?

48:39.244 --> 48:41.434
And how do you come
to speak our words?

48:41.608 --> 48:45.969
A man come from the mountain before.
He was looking for new land.

48:46.170 --> 48:48.726
Our wise man told me to learn his words.

48:48.901 --> 48:51.763
You. You have his face.

49:02.256 --> 49:03.811
What happened to him?

49:04.687 --> 49:07.049
He was taken a long time ago.

49:07.351 --> 49:09.282
Taken where?

49:10.981 --> 49:12.412
Come.

49:13.179 --> 49:16.938
<i>When your father came to us,
he became my friend.</i>

49:17.110 --> 49:22.163
<i>Then the evil spirits stole your father,
like many of our people.</i>

49:23.070 --> 49:26.295
They bring them to the nest
of the great birds...

49:26.634 --> 49:29.029
...and fly away over the sand.

49:30.131 --> 49:31.493
Where do they take them?

49:33.095 --> 49:35.355
To the mountain of the gods.

49:36.592 --> 49:39.680
No one has ever returned.

49:41.554 --> 49:45.711
Our wise man says you will lead us there.

49:46.750 --> 49:47.907
Me?

49:50.013 --> 49:52.307
We have a telling that...

49:52.777 --> 49:55.366
...one day the one will come...

49:56.507 --> 49:59.130
...who will free our people.

50:02.569 --> 50:06.395
The one who speaks to the Spear Tooth.

50:08.930 --> 50:13.857
<i>At last, the brave people
of the Naku buried their dead.</i>

50:14.025 --> 50:16.818
<i>They sent word to all the tribes
of the land...</i>

50:16.989 --> 50:20.316
<i>... that the one who speaks
to the Spear Tooth had come.</i>

50:22.984 --> 50:24.108
<i>Their call...</i>

50:24.416 --> 50:27.107
<i>... was a call for war.</i>

50:29.878 --> 50:32.671
Why do they think
I can free their people?

50:38.870 --> 50:41.265
There's something you must know
about your father.

50:43.865 --> 50:47.988
When your mother died
bringing you life...

50:50.359 --> 50:54.288
...your father took upon himself
not only the weight of you...

50:54.822 --> 50:56.752
...but all our people.

50:56.954 --> 50:58.543
We were starving.

50:58.718 --> 51:02.647
He could not wait for Old Mother's
prophecy to come true.

51:04.813 --> 51:07.276
Your father did not run away.

51:07.977 --> 51:10.202
He left to save our people.

51:10.375 --> 51:14.667
How could you let me believe all this time
that my father betrayed us?

51:14.838 --> 51:18.063
Because he wanted it to be that way.

51:18.468 --> 51:21.659
Your father carried the White Spear.

51:21.831 --> 51:26.657
He feared that when he left, others would
follow him and abandon our people.

51:28.325 --> 51:32.277
And why do you tell me this now?

51:34.320 --> 51:36.216
A good man...

51:36.985 --> 51:40.811
...draws a circle around himself
and cares for those within.

51:41.714 --> 51:44.541
His woman, his children.

51:44.711 --> 51:47.174
Other men draw a larger circle...

51:47.342 --> 51:50.305
...and bring within
their brothers and sisters.

51:50.472 --> 51:52.800
But some men...

51:53.036 --> 51:55.364
...have a great destiny.

51:56.133 --> 51:58.324
They must draw around themselves...

51:58.498 --> 52:03.051
...a circle that includes
many, many more.

52:03.827 --> 52:08.585
Your father was one of those men.

52:11.919 --> 52:14.247
You must decide for yourself...

52:14.684 --> 52:18.772
...whether you are, as well.

52:33.501 --> 52:35.930
This is Kawu, our fastest runner.

52:38.296 --> 52:40.726
He bring words from the people
who live that way.

52:41.626 --> 52:43.749
They stole many more men.

52:43.925 --> 52:46.185
And now they are moving
to the great birds, fast.

52:46.556 --> 52:49.076
We must find them
before they reach these birds.

53:06.604 --> 53:07.829
You have no woman?

53:09.701 --> 53:12.062
The day before you came...

53:12.399 --> 53:14.522
...they took her breath...

53:16.762 --> 53:18.952
...and they stole our son.

53:37.409 --> 53:39.306
I am Baku.

53:40.673 --> 53:42.228
Tudu.

53:42.805 --> 53:45.735
No. I am Baku.

53:46.869 --> 53:50.922
Baku, Tudu. Baku, Tudu.

54:15.276 --> 54:18.001
He's killing him! You must help!

54:48.813 --> 54:54.741
<i>The word of the Naku traveled fast
and from all winds came many warriors.</i>

54:54.908 --> 55:00.200
<i>The Tutt Tutt who move like big running
birds and hide their eyes behind trees.</i>

55:00.369 --> 55:04.559
<i>The tribe of the Kula.
They are short like our young ones.</i>

55:04.732 --> 55:09.058
<i>And from the valley without sun
came the ones with blood on their heads.</i>

55:10.893 --> 55:13.755
<i>But the strongest of them all
were the Hoda.</i>

55:15.456 --> 55:19.509
<i>Their leader spoke for all the warriors
of the land.</i>

55:29.610 --> 55:35.128
Tell him if his people walk with us,
we will bring them down.

55:43.130 --> 55:45.997
He says you are only a boy.

55:49.904 --> 55:52.372
Tell him I am older than I look.

55:54.308 --> 55:57.903
Quina is Hoda. Hoda do not laugh.

55:58.512 --> 55:59.979
Hmm.

56:15.830 --> 56:19.322
<i>- Yahalah!
- Yahalah!</i>

56:30.544 --> 56:36.005
<i>They walked faster and faster
and did not slow down to eat or to rest.</i>

56:36.183 --> 56:39.949
<i>And more spears joined them
with each passing day.</i>

56:48.496 --> 56:51.090
<i>This word "Yahalah," what does it mean?</i>

56:51.265 --> 56:55.531
They are your words.
"We must bring them down."

57:12.353 --> 57:14.048
The great birds have arrived.

57:31.305 --> 57:32.363
Evolet!

57:36.544 --> 57:38.341
Evolet!

57:38.512 --> 57:40.036
Baku, D'Leh is here.

57:52.493 --> 57:54.256
D'Leh!

57:55.296 --> 57:57.730
Tudu! Tudu!

58:03.771 --> 58:05.261
Tudu!

58:21.222 --> 58:24.658
Tudu, that man with the spear,
he will not give up.

58:24.825 --> 58:26.793
Him with her.

58:28.863 --> 58:31.263
- Ew.
- Maybe the boy is right.

58:31.732 --> 58:34.132
D'Leh cannot fly over water
like they can.

58:34.301 --> 58:36.667
Who would've thought
he could find so many spears?

58:41.942 --> 58:44.740
This river moves like a snake in the sand.

58:46.680 --> 58:50.081
He says the eye of the snake
rests under the sun...

58:51.385 --> 58:54.286
...and under the moon it does not move.

58:54.455 --> 58:57.583
Is there a shorter way
to the head of the snake?

59:01.695 --> 59:05.461
We must look beyond the great sand.
But no one can walk that far.

59:06.400 --> 59:09.028
The mountains and the sand...

59:09.203 --> 59:12.263
...they all look the same,
and we will lose our way.

59:13.841 --> 59:15.832
We will all die.

59:20.614 --> 59:22.844
We will find the head of the snake.

59:24.185 --> 59:26.085
And we will free our people.

59:48.375 --> 59:49.899
We must rest.

59:51.445 --> 59:55.711
<i>The man from the river
had spoken the truth.</i>

59:56.317 --> 01:00:00.310
<i>They had walked in circles for many days
and lost their way.</i>

01:00:01.822 --> 01:00:07.021
<i>And the eye of the snake
was nowhere to be found.</i>

01:01:03.450 --> 01:01:07.011
Tic'Tic, Tic'Tic.
I have found the eye of the snake.

01:01:07.221 --> 01:01:08.381
You see that light?

01:01:08.856 --> 01:01:11.381
That one? Remember
what the river people said?

01:01:11.558 --> 01:01:15.551
It rests under the sun,
but under the moon it does not move.

01:01:16.330 --> 01:01:18.298
Nakudu, tell them what I said.

01:01:18.632 --> 01:01:21.533
It will guide us to the head of the snake.

01:01:39.219 --> 01:01:43.815
<i>And as the last moon had come
to the valley of the Yagahl...</i>

01:01:43.991 --> 01:01:48.325
<i>... it seemed that all spirits
had left Old Mother.</i>

01:01:48.495 --> 01:01:51.987
<i>She did not eat or speak
for many moons...</i>

01:01:52.199 --> 01:01:56.693
<i>... because she knew
there was one last destiny to fulfill.</i>

01:01:56.870 --> 01:01:58.633
Wise Spirit...

01:01:59.273 --> 01:02:01.935
...it's me, Katan.

01:02:43.717 --> 01:02:45.582
The mountains of the gods.

01:02:47.087 --> 01:02:49.078
And the head of the snake.

01:04:07.901 --> 01:04:09.459
Evolet. You are well.

01:04:09.636 --> 01:04:11.194
Shh. Do not speak.

01:04:23.984 --> 01:04:25.645
Baku, over here.

01:04:31.058 --> 01:04:34.050
How can men do such a thing
to Father Mannak?

01:04:35.028 --> 01:04:36.586
They are not men like us, Baku.

01:04:36.964 --> 01:04:38.158
Then what are they?

01:04:39.032 --> 01:04:41.500
Some say they came from the stars.

01:04:41.668 --> 01:04:44.694
Others believe that they flew across
the great water...

01:04:44.872 --> 01:04:46.840
...when their land sank into the sea.

01:05:37.457 --> 01:05:38.924
No! Moha!

01:05:45.632 --> 01:05:47.122
Moha!

01:05:50.771 --> 01:05:52.671
Moha!

01:06:05.919 --> 01:06:08.581
There are too many of them
for every one of us.

01:06:09.222 --> 01:06:11.281
No one can bring them down.

01:06:12.726 --> 01:06:14.489
No, D'Leh.

01:06:15.929 --> 01:06:19.126
The ones they force to do their work...

01:06:19.666 --> 01:06:21.099
...they are even more.

01:06:22.436 --> 01:06:24.666
Do you think they will fight with us?

01:06:24.905 --> 01:06:27.396
That is for you to find out.

01:06:28.275 --> 01:06:29.742
Hmm?

01:07:25.365 --> 01:07:27.196
Ah, D'Leh.

01:07:27.668 --> 01:07:28.965
D'Leh.

01:07:29.903 --> 01:07:31.962
Tudu.
- Do not be afraid, Baku.

01:07:32.139 --> 01:07:33.333
I'll bring you home.

01:07:35.642 --> 01:07:36.802
Where is Evolet?

01:07:36.977 --> 01:07:40.970
The women sleep in different huts,
but I saw her today.

01:07:44.618 --> 01:07:47.644
Tic'Tic is waiting with many spears,
behind the sand.

01:07:48.722 --> 01:07:52.317
They killed Moha today.
He was sacrificed.

01:07:53.827 --> 01:07:57.319
It was my mistake that put you
in this terrible place.

01:07:57.497 --> 01:07:59.328
I need your forgiveness.

01:08:00.701 --> 01:08:03.864
The Fathers chose you to lead us...

01:08:04.204 --> 01:08:07.037
...and we will stand by your side.

01:08:13.880 --> 01:08:17.509
Tell him how many spears we have.
Ask him to fight with us.

01:08:23.590 --> 01:08:26.058
He says the number of spear
does not matter.

01:08:26.225 --> 01:08:29.218
- Men cannot bring down gods.
- Shh.

01:08:54.488 --> 01:08:57.616
He says the blind man
knows much about the gods.

01:08:58.558 --> 01:09:03.051
He was once their servant but ran away.
They have hidden him here ever since.

01:09:04.131 --> 01:09:05.758
Wise man...

01:09:07.434 --> 01:09:09.527
...tell us more of these gods.

01:09:19.145 --> 01:09:22.582
First, there were three,
but now there's only one left.

01:09:23.015 --> 01:09:25.541
There must be a way to defeat him.

01:09:28.955 --> 01:09:30.582
He said, once...

01:09:30.756 --> 01:09:34.886
...only once, he heard the god
speak of one he fears.

01:09:36.263 --> 01:09:39.755
They have a telling of one
who wears a mark...

01:09:39.933 --> 01:09:43.300
...that you can see in the sky at night.

01:09:43.470 --> 01:09:46.131
<i>They call it Uru-Anna,
the Mark of the Hunter.</i>

01:09:48.642 --> 01:09:51.236
The brightest star of all heaven.

01:09:58.385 --> 01:10:01.445
He asks if you wear
the Mark of the Hunter.

01:10:11.131 --> 01:10:13.964
Without the mark,
you cannot bring down the god.

01:10:27.147 --> 01:10:29.274
Wait, wait. The band on your arm...

01:10:30.884 --> 01:10:32.181
...where did you get it?

01:10:34.354 --> 01:10:36.219
From the man who saved his life.

01:10:36.389 --> 01:10:37.651
Where is he?

01:10:40.126 --> 01:10:42.993
His bones are buried in the sand
with all the others.

01:10:45.665 --> 01:10:48.566
He wants to know why
you ask of this man.

01:10:48.735 --> 01:10:49.997
He was my father.

01:11:20.867 --> 01:11:22.095
Ask him where Tic'Tic is.

01:11:25.805 --> 01:11:27.397
They found us!

01:12:32.906 --> 01:12:35.272
I am full with days.

01:12:36.343 --> 01:12:39.642
Please, great hunter, do not say that.
We need you.

01:12:41.982 --> 01:12:44.507
They will not fight with us.

01:12:45.652 --> 01:12:48.177
They have their own prophecy.

01:12:48.621 --> 01:12:50.213
D'Leh...

01:12:51.624 --> 01:12:56.789
...a prophecy has many faces,
many ways to come true.

01:12:57.931 --> 01:12:59.592
Your father...

01:12:59.766 --> 01:13:02.701
Your father, he gave this to me.

01:13:02.869 --> 01:13:05.133
- No, great hunter, this is yours.
- Take it.

01:13:10.510 --> 01:13:12.307
Be as your father.

01:13:14.247 --> 01:13:15.714
Be as your father.

01:13:22.489 --> 01:13:24.150
Be as your father.

01:17:21.928 --> 01:17:23.520
D'Leh...

01:17:24.497 --> 01:17:26.965
...I know how it feels
to lose a good friend.

01:17:29.435 --> 01:17:31.733
Your father was mine.

01:17:33.072 --> 01:17:35.233
I barely remember him.

01:17:35.742 --> 01:17:37.767
He remembered you.

01:17:39.812 --> 01:17:45.250
His heart hurt when he spoke of
a young boy behind the Great Mountains.

01:17:45.418 --> 01:17:48.819
He was preparing to leave
to go back to you.

01:17:49.122 --> 01:17:51.386
That is when he was taken.

01:17:57.997 --> 01:17:59.396
D'Leh...

01:18:00.133 --> 01:18:02.192
...the men are waiting.

01:19:01.794 --> 01:19:05.423
We, the people of the Yagahl...

01:19:07.800 --> 01:19:10.598
...hunt the mightiest of beasts,
the Mannak.

01:19:13.439 --> 01:19:17.398
He is great and we are small,
and still we bring him down.

01:19:23.049 --> 01:19:26.348
Because we hunt together, as one.

01:19:29.255 --> 01:19:31.223
When the sun rises...

01:19:32.525 --> 01:19:36.393
...we will join our brothers and sisters
on the mountain of the god...

01:19:37.330 --> 01:19:41.198
...and convince them to fight with us,
together, as one!

01:20:12.265 --> 01:20:13.857
What is happening?

01:20:14.634 --> 01:20:18.229
Listen, Baku,
today you must become a hunter.

01:20:18.404 --> 01:20:19.837
Me?

01:20:26.412 --> 01:20:28.403
<i>Yahalah.</i>

01:21:17.797 --> 01:21:19.594
Look, Ka'ren, look.

01:21:20.266 --> 01:21:22.166
- That one.
- Him?

01:21:23.302 --> 01:21:25.395
Baku, we found the lead bull. Go!

01:21:29.208 --> 01:21:30.698
Now!

01:21:52.198 --> 01:21:53.460
Quina, not yet!

01:21:59.105 --> 01:22:00.538
Now!

01:22:17.757 --> 01:22:18.849
Ha! Ha!

01:22:28.501 --> 01:22:31.436
- They will not charge.
- The Mannak have been beaten too long.

01:22:33.639 --> 01:22:35.368
Ka'ren, look.

01:22:38.544 --> 01:22:40.205
You must move everybody up the ramp!

01:22:40.379 --> 01:22:41.937
- Move! Move!
- Go! Go!

01:22:44.617 --> 01:22:46.016
Ka'ren! No!

01:23:52.785 --> 01:23:53.945
<i>Yahalah!</i>

01:23:55.421 --> 01:23:58.015
<i>- Yahalah!
- Yahalah!</i>

01:25:07.193 --> 01:25:08.319
<i>Yahalah!</i>

01:25:32.618 --> 01:25:34.483
Stop!

01:25:34.820 --> 01:25:36.549
Stop!

01:26:19.465 --> 01:26:24.903
He says the one who follow this woman
should turn back or she will die.

01:26:30.876 --> 01:26:32.571
Like this traitor.

01:26:36.882 --> 01:26:41.615
Turn back to your mountains
and you can take your woman.

01:26:50.496 --> 01:26:52.862
Tell him I will take his offer.

01:26:57.269 --> 01:26:59.066
Tell him I accept.

01:27:01.807 --> 01:27:03.434
Tell him!

01:27:09.114 --> 01:27:12.015
But I will take all my people with me.

01:27:13.285 --> 01:27:15.014
Each and every Yagahl.

01:27:19.525 --> 01:27:21.254
Tell him!

01:27:37.610 --> 01:27:39.510
They are yours!

01:27:40.980 --> 01:27:43.414
Ask him what will happen to the others.

01:28:02.234 --> 01:28:06.830
They belong to the god, he says.
They will do his work, forever.

01:28:13.245 --> 01:28:14.803
No.

01:28:16.749 --> 01:28:18.649
They will not.

01:28:43.309 --> 01:28:45.607
He is not a god!

01:29:16.475 --> 01:29:18.238
D'Leh!

01:29:24.450 --> 01:29:25.576
Evolet!

01:29:30.089 --> 01:29:31.249
Baku!

01:29:40.432 --> 01:29:42.161
Tudu!

01:29:42.334 --> 01:29:43.426
No!

01:30:53.672 --> 01:30:54.832
No!

01:31:17.396 --> 01:31:19.728
Help! Help! She's bleeding!

01:32:07.913 --> 01:32:10.245
You came for me.

01:32:16.588 --> 01:32:18.647
No, no, please.

01:32:19.925 --> 01:32:22.621
You came for me.

01:32:24.796 --> 01:32:26.093
Please.

01:32:26.265 --> 01:32:27.755
Please.

01:33:29.761 --> 01:33:32.355
<i>To have journeyed so far...</i>

01:33:32.531 --> 01:33:34.556
<i>... to have walked to the end
of the world...</i>

01:33:34.733 --> 01:33:38.294
<i>... to bring down the one
they called the Almighty...</i>

01:33:38.470 --> 01:33:42.497
<i>... only to return without Evolet.</i>

01:33:43.008 --> 01:33:46.341
<i>This was not what Old Mother
had foretold.</i>

01:33:54.186 --> 01:33:57.519
<i>But just as she was lost to him forever...</i>

01:33:57.923 --> 01:34:03.054
<i>... the legend of the child
with the blue eyes began.</i>

01:35:20.605 --> 01:35:22.505
Evolet and D'Leh!

01:35:26.878 --> 01:35:31.144
<i>Evolet had brought the promise of life
to our people.</i>

01:35:31.316 --> 01:35:34.649
<i>And now, with her last breath...</i>

01:35:34.820 --> 01:35:38.119
<i>... Old Mother had given it back.</i>

01:35:43.829 --> 01:35:47.162
Your father wanted to
bring these back to you.

01:35:47.332 --> 01:35:49.027
They will feed your people.

01:35:49.768 --> 01:35:54.000
Tell them the people of the Yagahl
thank the Naku people.

01:36:05.484 --> 01:36:08.783
Thank you, brother Nakudu.

01:36:10.822 --> 01:36:14.019
My heart walks with you, brother D'Leh.

01:36:25.937 --> 01:36:29.839
<i>That was the last time
they saw their friends the Naku.</i>

01:36:35.147 --> 01:36:38.981
<i>And then the long journey home began.</i>

01:36:54.332 --> 01:36:56.732
They're back! They're back!

01:37:03.275 --> 01:37:05.641
<i>And as the ones who walked
with the Fathers...</i>

01:37:05.811 --> 01:37:09.008
<i>... looked down on them
and guided their way...</i>

01:37:09.181 --> 01:37:14.744
<i>... so the Yagahl looked to Evolet and D'Leh
to guide their people.</i>

01:37:17.055 --> 01:37:21.253
<i>And when the first moon was born again
to their valley...</i>

01:37:21.426 --> 01:37:25.487
<i>... it brought with it
the first fruits of their land.</i>

01:37:25.664 --> 01:37:27.825
Look how fast it is growing.

01:37:38.810 --> 01:37:42.837
<i>And so it came to pass
that the promise of life...</i>

01:37:43.548 --> 01:37:45.914
<i>... was fulfilled.</i>

01:43:45.915 --> 01:43:46.915
