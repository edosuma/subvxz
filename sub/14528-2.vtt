00:40.165 --> 00:42.376
So, do you want me
to jump out of the cake

00:42.376 --> 00:43.669
for Jacob's birthday party?

00:43.669 --> 00:45.295
No, I actually want
you to do something

00:45.295 --> 00:46.838
that you've never
done before.

00:46.838 --> 00:48.173

screwing it up.

just two months

00:55.138 --> 00:56.556

late on rent.

00:56.556 --> 00:57.724
So are you!

00:57.724 --> 00:59.518
Yeah, but I'm being
responsible about it.

00:59.518 --> 01:01.019
What is that--call your dad?

01:01.019 --> 01:03.522
Yes, and he offered to help

01:03.522 --> 01:05.315
if we let my sister move in.

01:07.150 --> 01:09.403
You don't have a sister.

01:09.403 --> 01:11.154
I do now.

01:11.154 --> 01:13.282
My father had a secret
family in Reseda.

01:13.282 --> 01:14.700
Can you believe it?

01:14.700 --> 01:16.368
Reseda.

01:16.368 --> 01:18.203
So she's your half sister?

01:18.203 --> 01:21.873
According to the court
ordered DNA test she is.

01:21.873 --> 01:22.916
Okay.

01:37.598 --> 01:41.727

Yeah.

01:43.228 --> 01:44.646
