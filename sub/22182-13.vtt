WEBVTT

00:02.403 --> 00:05.039
Go, go, go, go, go!
GALLO: They have the package.

00:05.073 --> 00:06.574
Everyone brace!
GALLO: We're going down.

00:09.577 --> 00:10.811
I'm an American citizen.

00:10.844 --> 00:12.546
Don't let him do this.
Move!

00:12.580 --> 00:13.781
Or I will shoot through you.

00:15.249 --> 00:17.151
We lied in our debriefs.

00:17.185 --> 00:18.119
We made that decision together.

00:18.152 --> 00:19.287
PORTER:
I cannot look at you

00:19.320 --> 00:21.689
without thinking
about all the lies.

00:21.722 --> 00:23.591
I'm sorry.
I can't do this anymore.

00:23.624 --> 00:26.127
We both know our relationship
has some blurry lines.

00:26.160 --> 00:28.196
HASKINS: This is what we've been
working toward for months.

00:28.229 --> 00:30.764
Our mission is to rescue
Sergeant Jimmy Kam

00:30.798 --> 00:32.766
and capture Khalid Samatar
alive.

00:32.800 --> 00:34.135
JIMMY:
Khalid has sent uranium

00:34.168 --> 00:36.137
to an associate in the U.S.

00:36.170 --> 00:37.037
to make a bomb.

00:38.272 --> 00:39.540
We're hit.

00:39.573 --> 00:41.809
Come on.

00:44.345 --> 00:45.279
He got you in the shoulder.

00:45.313 --> 00:46.347
Lucky me.

00:48.816 --> 00:50.184
Jimmy.

00:50.218 --> 00:51.051
Hey! He's dead. He's dead.

00:51.085 --> 00:52.786
Come on. I got a family
to get back to.

00:52.820 --> 00:54.488
I know this woman.
It's Olivia Benning.

00:54.522 --> 00:55.623
We found the bomber.

00:55.656 --> 00:57.491
ANDREW: The charge
on the tail rotor went off

00:57.525 --> 00:58.726
as planned,
but the pilots survived.

00:58.759 --> 01:00.661
They're trying to find their way
out of the bunker right now.

01:00.694 --> 01:02.163
Should I finish it?
Yes.

01:02.196 --> 01:03.531
And make it look clean.

01:05.566 --> 01:07.535
JIMMY:
I know there's a back way out.

01:07.568 --> 01:09.170
Heard them talk about it
a few times.

01:09.203 --> 01:11.872
Too bad you didn't bring
any bread crumbs.

01:11.905 --> 01:13.674
All these tunnels look the same.

01:13.707 --> 01:17.245
Ha. Hey, smartass, you want
to lead the way, be my guest.

01:17.278 --> 01:18.646
Man, I've missed our banter.

01:18.679 --> 01:19.880
All right, boys,
you're gonna have

01:19.913 --> 01:20.881
a whole plane ride to catch up.

01:20.914 --> 01:22.350
Let's pick up the pace.

01:24.252 --> 01:25.653
You okay?

01:25.686 --> 01:26.687
GALLO:
Yeah, I'll be fine.

01:29.557 --> 01:32.660
HASKINS :
Gallo, Madani, do you read?

01:32.693 --> 01:34.362
Yes, sir. We're still trying

01:34.395 --> 01:36.330
to find our way out.
Looks like Khalid called in

01:36.364 --> 01:39.133
support from a nearby village
before he died.

01:39.167 --> 01:40.401
60 men, give or take.

01:40.434 --> 01:42.270
The Little Birds will try to
hold them off,

01:42.303 --> 01:43.671
but there's only so long
they can.

01:43.704 --> 01:45.506
I'd estimate 20 minutes.

01:45.539 --> 01:47.875
You need to be in the air
by then, or you will

01:47.908 --> 01:50.211
find yourselves
in a hell of a firefight.

01:53.414 --> 01:56.250
*

02:03.257 --> 02:04.692
PEREZ:
Everything's under control.

02:04.725 --> 02:05.926
Has anyone seen the suspect?

02:05.959 --> 02:07.328
Negative. I got
guys in there now,

02:07.361 --> 02:08.696
no sign of Olivia Benning.

02:08.729 --> 02:09.930
Everyone who's inside
went through those?

02:09.963 --> 02:11.465
I've been assured
that's the case.

02:11.499 --> 02:12.666
We swept the area
before the event.

02:12.700 --> 02:14.268
That is not good enough.

02:14.302 --> 02:16.170
We know that this is the target,
we should evacuate.

02:16.204 --> 02:18.672
Based on what
No one's actually seen

02:18.706 --> 02:20.941
this woman in the area.
Evacuating would be chaos.

02:20.974 --> 02:21.942
Okay, well, Lieutenant Porter
and I are gonna

02:21.975 --> 02:22.943
go inside and look
for ourselves.

02:22.976 --> 02:24.212
Be my guest.

02:24.245 --> 02:25.613
Hey, bomb tech guy.

02:25.646 --> 02:26.647
With us.

02:41.495 --> 02:43.197
Stop a second.

02:43.231 --> 02:45.199
I felt a breeze.

02:45.233 --> 02:47.335
It was just a little bit.

02:47.368 --> 02:49.537
It's coming from...

02:49.570 --> 02:51.405
that direction.

02:51.439 --> 02:53.407
Anchor Zero-Six, it looks
like we've found a way out.

02:53.441 --> 02:55.676
HASKINS:
Roger that.

02:55.709 --> 02:57.378
You need to get
to the exfil site, ASAP.

02:57.411 --> 02:59.647
Alpha and Bravo Teams
are already en route.

02:59.680 --> 03:02.250
How's that leg
holding up, Sergeant?

03:03.417 --> 03:05.286
Actually, you two
are holding it up.

03:05.319 --> 03:06.287
And the morphine.

03:06.320 --> 03:07.888
Yeah, well, hang in there.

03:07.921 --> 03:09.490
We'll get to the
helo in one piece.

03:09.523 --> 03:11.559
Two, tops.

03:11.592 --> 03:13.561
Hopefully, uh, the CIA
operator meets us there.

03:13.594 --> 03:15.596
He kind of disappeared on us.

03:15.629 --> 03:19.800
Yeah, there's something I should
maybe tell you, Sergeant.

03:19.833 --> 03:22.336
Just a second.

03:22.370 --> 03:23.771
What's going on?

03:23.804 --> 03:25.973
Look, it's probably nothing.

03:26.006 --> 03:29.677
But when he went to sweep
the perimeter,

03:29.710 --> 03:32.513
I saw him grab a gun
from one of the dead tangos.

03:32.546 --> 03:34.315
Officer Andrew has
his own weapon.

03:34.348 --> 03:36.350
You sure this isn't
the morphine talking?

03:36.384 --> 03:38.018
No.

03:38.051 --> 03:39.953
That don't make any sense.

03:47.861 --> 03:49.330
You okay?

03:49.363 --> 03:50.864
Yeah. I'm just not used to being

03:50.898 --> 03:52.300
out in the open.

03:52.333 --> 03:54.034
But I'm good.

03:54.067 --> 03:56.437
Anchor Zero-Six,

03:56.470 --> 03:57.638
this is Madani.

03:57.671 --> 03:58.806
We've made it out of the bunker.

03:58.839 --> 04:00.474
Headed to the exfil site.

04:00.508 --> 04:02.042
Roger that.
Since Renegade One-Two

04:02.075 --> 04:04.378
has been destroyed, that leaves

04:04.412 --> 04:07.415
only one Black Hawk to carry
two helos' worth of personnel.

04:07.448 --> 04:09.283
With Khalid's guys on the way,
there's no time

04:09.317 --> 04:10.351
to bring in another bird.

04:10.384 --> 04:12.520
Sir, that's gonna be rough
with all that weight.

04:12.553 --> 04:14.422
We'll have to do
a max gross takeoff.

04:15.423 --> 04:16.857
Luckily,
it ain't my first rodeo.

04:16.890 --> 04:18.892
Good. 'Cause the other pilots
have never

04:18.926 --> 04:19.960
done one in the field.

04:19.993 --> 04:22.296
Sir, you need two arms

04:22.330 --> 04:23.331
to fly a helo.

04:23.364 --> 04:24.465
Yeah, it still works.

04:25.466 --> 04:26.967
I'll power through the pain.

04:27.000 --> 04:28.736
Easy-peasy.

04:29.903 --> 04:31.505
Let's move.

04:42.516 --> 04:43.584
In too many pockets
of the globe,

04:43.617 --> 04:44.985
there are cities crying out

04:45.018 --> 04:46.620
for the moral indignation

04:46.654 --> 04:47.721
of their citizens...

04:47.755 --> 04:49.623
Hey. Have you seen this woman?

04:49.657 --> 04:50.724
No, sorry.
...only to learn that their pain

04:50.758 --> 04:53.994
has been met
by deafening silence.

04:54.027 --> 04:55.663
Have you... seen
this woman anywhere?

04:55.696 --> 04:57.731
MAGNUS:
...Washington bureaucracy...

04:58.999 --> 05:00.434
...weary of ensnarling
our armed forces

05:00.468 --> 05:01.569
and ground operations.

05:01.602 --> 05:03.871
Sir. Have you seen
this woman anywhere?

05:03.904 --> 05:06.507
Yeah. A few minutes ago.

05:06.540 --> 05:08.075
You just saw her?

05:08.108 --> 05:09.343
Yeah, she was leaving.
She went out that way.

05:09.377 --> 05:11.078
All right.

05:11.111 --> 05:12.513
I'm going after her. If she
planted that bomb here,

05:12.546 --> 05:13.581
you need to find it.

05:13.614 --> 05:14.648
MAGNUS:
And make no mistake.

05:14.682 --> 05:16.584
As we retreat, others march on.

05:19.687 --> 05:21.389
What are you doing?
We have a situation, sir.

05:21.422 --> 05:22.723
The suspect was here,
which means the bomb

05:22.756 --> 05:25.092
was likely planted in this room.

05:25.125 --> 05:28.061
What's going on?
I need these people
evacuated now.

05:28.095 --> 05:29.329
Take care of it.

05:31.932 --> 05:34.535
Ladies and gentlemen,

05:34.568 --> 05:37.104
um...

05:37.137 --> 05:39.039
We have reason to believe that
there's a bomb in this room.

05:39.072 --> 05:40.408
You need to leave immediately.

05:44.412 --> 05:46.414
I really hope
you're right about this.

05:46.447 --> 05:47.715
I really hope I'm not.

05:48.916 --> 05:51.719
Excuse me.

06:17.044 --> 06:20.581
Looks like Sergeant Cho
was on to something.

06:21.815 --> 06:24.518
What the hell just happened?

06:24.552 --> 06:25.519
We heard shots.

06:25.553 --> 06:26.687
COOGAN:
That was me.

06:26.720 --> 06:27.888
He heard me coming up behind,

06:27.921 --> 06:29.857
turned his gun on me,
tried to fire,

06:29.890 --> 06:31.659
so I fired back.
With better aim.

06:31.692 --> 06:33.561
What were you even doing here?

06:33.594 --> 06:34.962
Well, if that's your way
of thanking me

06:34.995 --> 06:37.898
for saving your lives,
you're welcome. Also,

06:37.931 --> 06:40.634
honored to finally meet
you, Sergeant Kam.

06:40.668 --> 06:41.902
Thank you.
Yeah.

06:41.935 --> 06:43.571
But what do you mean,
"saving our lives"?

06:43.604 --> 06:44.805
Oh, Sergeant Cho

06:44.838 --> 06:46.674
told me that she saw him
take a gun

06:46.707 --> 06:48.542
from one of the dead hostiles.
That obviously raised

06:48.576 --> 06:50.010
some questions,
so I followed him,

06:50.043 --> 06:51.278
saw him lining up
to shoot y'all.

06:51.311 --> 06:53.847
He was trying to make it
seem like one of Khalid's
guys did it.

06:53.881 --> 06:55.549
And the way the tail rotor blew.

06:55.583 --> 06:56.750
You think he sabotaged it?

06:56.784 --> 06:58.519
Makes sense.

06:58.552 --> 07:00.588
Are you kidding me? None
of this makes any sense.

07:00.621 --> 07:02.923
Why is he trying to kill you?
That's a good question.

07:02.956 --> 07:04.925
But if we don't get out before
Khalid's friends arrive...

07:06.159 --> 07:07.761
...it ain't really gonna matter.

07:07.795 --> 07:10.097
THEA: The bomb could be anywhere
in the room.

07:10.130 --> 07:12.900
And this Professor Benning, you
believe she's been radicalized?

07:12.933 --> 07:14.902
No, we don't know what her
motives are. We just know
that she was here.

07:14.935 --> 07:16.537
Look, I would feel a lot better
if the two of you weren't.

07:16.570 --> 07:17.538
MAGNUS:
Well, you should go, too.

07:17.571 --> 07:19.239
All right? Let these
professionals do their jobs.

07:19.272 --> 07:21.241
I'm not gonna leave
until we find it.

07:21.274 --> 07:22.776
The uranium wouldn't be here
in the first place

07:22.810 --> 07:24.244
if it wasn't for our operation.

07:24.277 --> 07:26.714
Did a woman run past here?

07:31.519 --> 07:33.186
And what about my son?
Where is he?

07:33.220 --> 07:34.655
He went after Benning.
Olivia!

07:34.688 --> 07:37.491
Stop.
Ian?

07:40.528 --> 07:42.195
Olivia!

07:42.229 --> 07:43.497
Don't come any closer.

07:43.531 --> 07:45.265
I can set it off with this.

07:45.298 --> 07:47.200
Stall her.
We still haven't found the bomb.

07:47.234 --> 07:49.503
Olivia.

07:49.537 --> 07:51.271
Why are you doing this?
I thought that I knew you.

07:51.304 --> 07:53.140
Is that why they sent you?

07:53.173 --> 07:54.174
They thought
it'd make a difference?

07:55.275 --> 07:57.110
Your government thinks
it can kill innocent people

07:57.144 --> 07:58.579
anywhere in the world.

07:59.847 --> 08:00.948
I'm sending a message.

08:00.981 --> 08:02.650
This is not the way.

08:02.683 --> 08:03.684
Blood for blood.

08:03.717 --> 08:04.918
It's the only
thing people

08:04.952 --> 08:06.720
like Tucker Magnus understand.

08:06.754 --> 08:07.688
This is about Magnus?

08:07.721 --> 08:09.256
That's who you're after?

08:09.289 --> 08:11.559
Sweep around the table
where Magnus was sitting.

08:11.592 --> 08:13.126
Olivia, they have already
evacuated that building.

08:13.160 --> 08:16.029
Magnus is long gone, and
everyone else is, too.

08:16.063 --> 08:19.099
The thing about a dirty bomb is,
it's full of radioactive dust.

08:19.132 --> 08:20.701
All that bomb
has to do

08:20.734 --> 08:22.803
is blow out a wall,
and half of downtown

08:22.836 --> 08:24.638
will be breathing poison.

08:24.672 --> 08:26.273
Got it.

08:28.642 --> 08:29.677
Can you defuse it?

08:29.710 --> 08:31.712
I'll try.
Try fast.

08:31.745 --> 08:33.781
Everyone that you
would hurt, they...

08:33.814 --> 08:35.649
they have loved ones.

08:35.683 --> 08:37.250
Family,

08:37.284 --> 08:39.620
friends.

08:39.653 --> 08:41.221
Think about that.

08:41.254 --> 08:42.990
Is this really how you want
to be remembered?

08:47.995 --> 08:48.929
Don't.

08:49.963 --> 08:51.732
Don't do this, Olivia.

08:53.967 --> 08:55.135
Don't.

08:57.805 --> 08:59.172
The bomb has been defused.

09:06.847 --> 09:09.683
COOGAN:
Khalid's backup's
five klicks away.

09:09.717 --> 09:10.751
We need to get out of here now.

09:19.727 --> 09:21.194
A max gross takeoff
is serious business.

09:21.228 --> 09:22.830
With all due respect,
I'd rather do it.

09:22.863 --> 09:24.632
You've only done it in training.

09:24.665 --> 09:25.733
Yeah, but I got two good arms.

09:25.766 --> 09:26.834
Doesn't matter
if you have three.

09:26.867 --> 09:27.935
You don't know how to use them.

09:27.968 --> 09:29.603
This is my bird, Captain.

09:29.637 --> 09:31.605
I'll do it.

09:31.639 --> 09:33.607
I've done the maneuver before,
I have two good arms,

09:33.641 --> 09:34.642
and since I don't
have a penis,

09:34.675 --> 09:36.009
I don't feel the need to join

09:36.043 --> 09:37.611
in this pissing contest.

09:40.881 --> 09:42.783
When have you ever
done this before?

09:42.816 --> 09:44.618
In training.

09:44.652 --> 09:45.753
Just like him.

09:45.786 --> 09:47.955
Since we have too much
weight to hover,

09:47.988 --> 09:50.758
we accelerate quickly,
keep the wheels on the ground.

09:50.791 --> 09:53.393
Once we hit liftoff
speed, we pull up.

09:53.426 --> 09:55.362
Hopefully before we smash
into that mountain.

09:55.395 --> 09:56.764
I got it.

10:03.270 --> 10:04.738
MADANI:
Everybody buckle up.

10:04.772 --> 10:07.007
It's gonna be a bumpy ride.

10:22.289 --> 10:24.792
Watch your power.

10:24.825 --> 10:26.660
You push too hard,
she'll quit.

10:26.694 --> 10:28.962
I don't push hard enough, we're
never gonna get off the ground.

10:28.996 --> 10:31.331
Well, then maybe
you should push just right.

10:37.705 --> 10:38.772
Madani.

10:38.806 --> 10:42.409
Not yet. Not yet.

10:42.442 --> 10:43.811
Madani!

10:43.844 --> 10:44.978
Now!

10:54.387 --> 10:57.357
GALLO:
Yeah, yeah!

10:57.390 --> 10:59.459
Whoa, let's never do that again.

11:02.930 --> 11:05.198
GALLO:
Anchor Zero-Six,

11:05.232 --> 11:06.934
we are in flight
and are RTB.

11:06.967 --> 11:08.902
See?

11:10.203 --> 11:11.438
Easy-peasy.

11:23.917 --> 11:26.119
I've been thinking.

11:26.153 --> 11:29.122
Look, I know we talked
about coming clean

11:29.156 --> 11:30.958
after we got Jimmy
and made it home...

11:30.991 --> 11:33.393
Still the plan.

11:33.426 --> 11:34.394
Still my plan.

11:34.427 --> 11:36.864
How exactly is
that gonna work?

11:36.897 --> 11:38.431
We just walk up
to the colonel and say,

11:38.465 --> 11:41.434
"Hey, you remember that mission
with CIA Officer Richard?

11:41.468 --> 11:43.236
"Yeah? Well...

11:43.270 --> 11:44.504
"she shot
and killed the guy

11:44.537 --> 11:46.439
"and then we covered
it up for months.

11:46.473 --> 11:49.376
We're ready
for a court-martial."

11:49.409 --> 11:52.445
We did it for the
right reasons, Gallo.

11:52.479 --> 11:53.881
To get to the
bottom of this.

11:53.914 --> 11:55.783
But we haven't, not yet.

11:55.816 --> 12:00.520
A CIA field agent
just tried to kill us.

12:00.553 --> 12:02.289
I'm betting anything
that's connected.

12:02.322 --> 12:05.192
Someone thinks
we know too much.

12:05.225 --> 12:07.494
Richard was a traitor.
We got proof of that.

12:07.527 --> 12:10.030
But clearly,
it didn't stop with him.

12:10.063 --> 12:13.200
There are six doubles
in a domino set, right?

12:13.233 --> 12:16.303
Six people who were part of
the CIA's uranium operation.

12:16.336 --> 12:17.437
Now, we know four of them,

12:17.470 --> 12:20.373
but not double-twos
and not snake eyes.

12:20.407 --> 12:22.843
We need to find out who they are

12:22.876 --> 12:24.945
and if they still have
any of that uranium.

12:26.914 --> 12:29.482
This isn't just about us
anymore, Madani.

12:29.516 --> 12:32.385
Other people could get hurt
if these guys aren't caught.

12:32.419 --> 12:36.156
I think you might be right.

12:36.189 --> 12:37.757
Don't act so surprised.
It happens.

12:39.592 --> 12:43.831
C-17's loading for home
in ten mikes.

12:43.864 --> 12:45.765
I'll see you out there.

12:59.880 --> 13:02.049
Hold on a sec.

13:04.451 --> 13:09.522
* Young boy,
what you fighting for? *

13:09.556 --> 13:10.858
* Who taught you
to be afraid... *

13:10.891 --> 13:12.025
Jimmy.

13:12.059 --> 13:16.830
* Of what you don't know?

13:19.166 --> 13:20.500
* Young man

13:20.533 --> 13:21.601
* What you looking for?

13:21.634 --> 13:23.303
Are you really here?

13:23.336 --> 13:25.505
Are you okay?
JIMMY:
Yeah, I'm okay.

13:25.538 --> 13:27.540
I'm okay.

13:27.574 --> 13:29.009
* You're part of a plan...

13:29.042 --> 13:30.944
Hey, big guy.

13:30.978 --> 13:34.181
I'm home. I'm home.

13:34.214 --> 13:37.117
HASKINS:
We have a lot of heroes here.

13:37.150 --> 13:42.455
Men and women of
the Operation Perseus Team,

13:42.489 --> 13:45.225
you have performed this mission
with intelligence,

13:45.258 --> 13:47.627
precision and valor.

13:47.660 --> 13:52.465
Because of that, you have
brought home one of our own.

13:52.499 --> 13:54.134
Sergeant Jimmy Kam.

13:58.405 --> 13:59.506
HASKINS: And now let's take
a moment of silence

13:59.539 --> 14:02.375
for those we've lost
along the way.

14:02.409 --> 14:06.613
* Share the past
we're all made of *

14:06.646 --> 14:08.581
* We have different...

14:08.615 --> 14:10.617
Shadow Raiders.

14:12.552 --> 14:13.987
Dismissed!

14:14.021 --> 14:17.390
* We can choose to change

14:17.424 --> 14:21.061
* And rise above

14:21.094 --> 14:22.930
* 'Cause love is love...

14:22.963 --> 14:25.065
Hey.

14:25.098 --> 14:27.434
* Love is love...

14:27.467 --> 14:28.501
You all right?

14:28.535 --> 14:32.973
I'm still here,
so... yeah.

14:33.006 --> 14:35.108
* Love is love...

14:35.142 --> 14:37.144
It's really good
to see you again.

14:39.179 --> 14:42.315
It's good to see
you, too, Ian.

14:42.349 --> 14:44.617
Welcome home.

14:44.651 --> 14:48.588
Congratulations,
Captain Gallo.

14:48.621 --> 14:50.423
How's the arm?

14:50.457 --> 14:52.960
Yeah, they say six weeks,
it'll be like new.

14:52.993 --> 14:54.627
Look at that.

14:54.661 --> 14:57.097
I need to talk to you.

14:57.130 --> 14:58.665
Madani and Coogan, too.

15:00.633 --> 15:02.435
We read your mission debriefs.

15:02.469 --> 15:03.570
Sounds like the sergeant here

15:03.603 --> 15:05.372
saved your asses.

15:05.405 --> 15:06.573
The question, though,

15:06.606 --> 15:08.341
is why did Officer Andrew
want to kill you?

15:08.375 --> 15:09.943
Considering he was one
of your colleagues,

15:09.977 --> 15:12.212
we were hoping you could shed
some light on that.

15:12.245 --> 15:14.081
I've gone through his file.
There's no red flags.

15:14.114 --> 15:16.549
Aiming an AK at three soldiers
isn't a red flag?

15:16.583 --> 15:18.251
You know what I mean.

15:18.285 --> 15:20.920
Mind if we take a look
at that file?

15:21.754 --> 15:23.390
I think they've earned a look,
don't you?

15:24.757 --> 15:26.259
This might help.

15:26.293 --> 15:27.594
It's his gear.

15:27.627 --> 15:29.129
There's a phone in there.
It's encrypted.

15:29.162 --> 15:30.597
Well, that's not
a long-term problem.

15:30.630 --> 15:32.732
The long-term
and short-term problem

15:32.765 --> 15:35.602
is someone gave that guy
an order to kill us.

15:35.635 --> 15:37.270
Unless he was acting alone.

15:37.304 --> 15:38.605
I've apprised Magnus
of the situation.

15:38.638 --> 15:39.739
He is looking into it, too.

15:39.772 --> 15:41.274
Well, excuse me if that doesn't

15:41.308 --> 15:43.543
exactly fill my pockets
with confetti.

15:43.576 --> 15:45.412
We will get
to the bottom of this.

15:45.445 --> 15:47.614
In the meantime, be careful.

15:59.759 --> 16:01.161
Anything I can help with?

16:01.194 --> 16:03.496
Absolutely not.

16:03.530 --> 16:05.332
You just relax.

16:05.365 --> 16:06.666
I will call you when it's ready.

16:06.699 --> 16:07.767
It smells great.

16:07.800 --> 16:10.137
Well, I am making

16:10.170 --> 16:12.539
all of your favorites.

16:12.572 --> 16:13.506
Oh, you didn't have to.

16:13.540 --> 16:15.375
Gotcha!

16:15.408 --> 16:17.310
Max. You cannot do that.

16:17.344 --> 16:19.046
MAX:
Why not?

16:19.079 --> 16:20.647
We do it all the time.

16:20.680 --> 16:22.615
Hey, it's fine.
It's fine.

16:22.649 --> 16:25.618
It's just we haven't done
"gotcha" in a while.

16:25.652 --> 16:28.655
I wasn't ready for it.

16:28.688 --> 16:31.058
Go wash your hands
for dinner, okay?

16:44.204 --> 16:45.438
I'm really sorry
about that.

16:45.472 --> 16:47.074
Hey, Jess, it's fine.

16:47.107 --> 16:48.608
He's a kid.

16:50.610 --> 16:53.180
Hey.

16:53.213 --> 16:55.515
You don't need to treat me
like I'm made of glass.

16:55.548 --> 16:59.452
I just want to make sure
that everything is okay.

16:59.486 --> 17:03.390
That you are okay.

17:05.392 --> 17:07.194
You know that you can
talk to me about...

17:07.227 --> 17:10.263
All I want to do
is move forward.

17:10.297 --> 17:13.533
I have my debrief with
the brass on Monday.

17:13.566 --> 17:17.170
Once I get through
that, I'm good.

17:29.782 --> 17:32.852
Anything interesting?

17:32.885 --> 17:34.821
Nothing that
connects this guy

17:34.854 --> 17:35.855
to the Richard mission

17:35.888 --> 17:37.690
and nothing that explains
why he would do it.

17:40.193 --> 17:42.629
Well, there's something else
we should talk about, too.

17:42.662 --> 17:44.664
Now we're back.

17:44.697 --> 17:47.367
The mule in the stable,
so to speak.

17:48.801 --> 17:50.770
You know,

17:50.803 --> 17:54.607
you and I are kind of
like the end of Speed.

17:59.612 --> 18:02.315
The end of Speed?

18:02.349 --> 18:04.717
Keanu, Sandra Bullock.

18:04.751 --> 18:10.557
He says, "Relationships based on
intense experiences never last."

18:10.590 --> 18:12.292
Then he's not in Speed 2,

18:12.325 --> 18:13.626
so clearly in their case,
it was true.

18:13.660 --> 18:14.894
Clearly.

18:14.927 --> 18:15.762
But doesn't have to be.

18:15.795 --> 18:17.597
And, yes,

18:17.630 --> 18:19.432
I know they're
fictional characters.

18:19.466 --> 18:23.736
I'm having trouble, you know,
finding the point to this.

18:23.770 --> 18:28.275
My point is I want
to give this a shot.

18:30.710 --> 18:32.912
We can't.

18:32.945 --> 18:34.847
Not while we're in the
same chain of command.

18:34.881 --> 18:36.349
I could transfer
to another unit.

18:38.951 --> 18:42.822
I can't ask you to give up
being a Shadow Raider,

18:42.855 --> 18:45.292
not after how hard you've worked
to get here.

18:45.325 --> 18:46.793
It's my choice to make.

18:51.731 --> 18:53.300
I don't know what to say.

18:53.333 --> 18:56.803
Just say you'll think about it.

19:05.812 --> 19:07.480
GALLO: So, when do you think
they're gonna

19:07.514 --> 19:08.581
let you back up in the air?

19:08.615 --> 19:11.618
Oh, it's hard to say.
Yeah.

19:11.651 --> 19:15.622
I've got that debrief with
the JSOC commander on Monday.

19:15.655 --> 19:17.524
Then we'll see what happens.

19:17.557 --> 19:21.494
Listen, man, um...

19:21.528 --> 19:24.564
not everything's
over and done.

19:24.597 --> 19:26.333
I want to apologize.

19:26.366 --> 19:27.600
For what?

19:27.634 --> 19:30.203
You came to me...

19:30.237 --> 19:32.272
before the mission
that started all of this

19:32.305 --> 19:35.208
and, uh, you said
you had a bad feeling.

19:36.809 --> 19:39.279
I should've listened to you.

19:42.282 --> 19:44.984
If you've been blaming yourself
for this,

19:45.017 --> 19:47.620
you should stop right now.

19:49.021 --> 19:50.790
You saved my life.

19:50.823 --> 19:52.592
Once I'm clear,

19:52.625 --> 19:55.962
I'm back to being your crew
chief first chance I get.

19:55.995 --> 19:57.964
Well, hell,
here's to that.

20:01.734 --> 20:03.636
Mmm.

20:03.670 --> 20:05.305
It's weird, man.

20:05.338 --> 20:08.775
We go through all these
crazy experiences together.

20:08.808 --> 20:11.778
We just push them aside.

20:11.811 --> 20:15.014
Don't think about it.

20:15.047 --> 20:16.416
Move forward.

20:19.051 --> 20:21.554
No way that's not coming
back on us someday.

20:23.590 --> 20:25.992
It's the price we pay
for doing what we do.

20:38.538 --> 20:39.972
Hi.

20:40.006 --> 20:41.574
Thought you might be running.

20:41.608 --> 20:44.277
You weren't home, so...

20:44.311 --> 20:45.412
Can we talk?

20:45.445 --> 20:47.347
Yeah, sure.

20:47.380 --> 20:49.582
I was just finishing up.

20:56.356 --> 20:58.658
The other day I was...

20:58.691 --> 21:00.493
standing across
from a woman

21:00.527 --> 21:03.663
who could've detonated
a bomb at any second.

21:06.098 --> 21:08.335
Seemed really
likely I might die.

21:10.437 --> 21:13.640
I couldn't stop
thinking about you.

21:17.043 --> 21:20.980
I promised myself that I would
tell you that if I survived.

21:23.350 --> 21:25.452
It was a mistake
to end things, Nora.

21:26.886 --> 21:28.821
I want to give
this another try.

21:28.855 --> 21:29.956
Ian.

21:29.989 --> 21:33.993
You know how much
I care about you.

21:36.563 --> 21:37.630
But...

21:40.667 --> 21:44.637
But you were right when you
said we needed some time apart.

21:49.742 --> 21:53.012
We had real problems, babe.

21:53.045 --> 21:56.349
And... even though

21:56.383 --> 21:58.685
most of them were my fault,
I think they were symptoms.

21:58.718 --> 22:02.054
Symptoms of what?

22:05.658 --> 22:08.795
Of how disconnected
we'd become.

22:08.828 --> 22:10.897
Some time alone

22:10.930 --> 22:13.733
will do us both good.

22:15.768 --> 22:18.137
Yup, I understand.

22:24.811 --> 22:27.113
They're calling me in.

22:27.146 --> 22:29.482
Go.

22:30.483 --> 22:33.853
I'm sorry.

22:39.926 --> 22:41.127
THEA:
We had one of our techs

22:41.160 --> 22:43.896
de-encrypt
Officer Andrew's phone.

22:43.930 --> 22:46.065
You were right. Someone did
give him the orders.

22:46.098 --> 22:48.401
Not only to blow
the tail rotor

22:48.435 --> 22:49.769
but to execute the two of you.

22:49.802 --> 22:51.404
The orders came from

22:51.438 --> 22:52.905
code name Matador.

22:52.939 --> 22:54.607
Matador

22:54.641 --> 22:55.608
Officer Richard, yes.

22:55.642 --> 22:57.977
We had written him
off as dead,

22:58.010 --> 22:58.978
lost in hostile territory.

22:59.011 --> 23:00.647
Clearly we were wrong.

23:00.680 --> 23:01.948
He must have
escaped Somalia

23:01.981 --> 23:03.115
the night your
helo crashed.

23:03.149 --> 23:05.518
He's been in hiding ever since.

23:05.552 --> 23:07.420
Turns out Richard and
Andrew knew each other.

23:07.454 --> 23:09.021
They'd trained together
at the Farm.

23:09.055 --> 23:10.757
When we went and talked
to Andrew's family,

23:10.790 --> 23:12.725
they told us about an influx
of cash to one of his accounts.

23:12.759 --> 23:15.728
We believe that Richard
paid him to do this.

23:15.762 --> 23:18.197
As to why he
wanted you dead,

23:18.230 --> 23:21.000
you were witnesses the night
he exfil'd Goundry.

23:21.033 --> 23:22.201
He must have thought

23:22.234 --> 23:24.103
that you saw something
you shouldn't have.

23:26.205 --> 23:28.107
They've assured me that
an international manhunt

23:28.140 --> 23:29.442
is underway to
find Richard.

23:30.910 --> 23:32.779
We will catch him.

23:34.481 --> 23:35.548
MADANI:
This makes no sense.

23:35.582 --> 23:37.450
Richard is dead.

23:37.484 --> 23:39.686
He had no pulse.
We rolled him into a lake.
Right.

23:39.719 --> 23:41.588
Richard can't be Matador.

23:41.621 --> 23:43.189
Magnus is the one
who said he was.

23:43.222 --> 23:45.692
After we saw the code name
in Goundry's papers.

23:45.725 --> 23:47.794
He sounded pretty damn certain
about it at the time.

23:47.827 --> 23:50.229
You know, I don't think we can
chalk this up to a mistake.

23:50.262 --> 23:52.164
So he lied.

23:53.132 --> 23:54.767
You think Magnus is the one
who actually...

23:54.801 --> 23:56.035
I don't know
if he ordered the hit,

23:56.068 --> 23:59.205
but I sure as hell know
Richard didn't.

23:59.238 --> 24:00.607
And Magnus clearly knows
more than he's saying.

24:00.640 --> 24:02.842
We're the only ones
who can prove that.

24:02.875 --> 24:05.111
The only ones who
know Richard is dead.

24:05.144 --> 24:08.515
But saying so means we have
to face the consequences.

24:09.682 --> 24:11.584
:
Yeah.

24:18.991 --> 24:21.193
Captain Gallo, Ms. Madani,

24:21.227 --> 24:22.662
how can I help you?

24:22.695 --> 24:24.697
Sir, we have
to tell you something.

24:31.571 --> 24:32.905
You concealed
the truth for months.

24:32.939 --> 24:34.641
There's no justification
for that.

24:34.674 --> 24:37.777
Sir, Madani wanted to come
clean right after it happened.

24:37.810 --> 24:40.179
I convinced her we needed
to find answers first.

24:40.212 --> 24:41.681
I made my own choices.

24:41.714 --> 24:42.949
It's not on him.

24:42.982 --> 24:44.584
I don't care who
did what when.

24:44.617 --> 24:47.253
You violated about
a dozen Army regulations.

24:47.286 --> 24:48.354
And as for Magnus,

24:48.387 --> 24:50.723
that's a pretty massive
accusation you're making,

24:50.757 --> 24:51.858
that he's willfully lying.

24:51.891 --> 24:54.226
You have two witnesses
to Richard's death right here.

24:55.795 --> 24:56.963
He must be lying.

24:56.996 --> 24:59.799
I'll bring it to Thea.

24:59.832 --> 25:01.934
I believe we can trust her.
So do we, sir.

25:01.968 --> 25:03.603
Now, about the two of you.

25:03.636 --> 25:06.172
This cannot go
unpunished.

25:06.205 --> 25:07.306
Lying on your debriefs,

25:07.339 --> 25:09.776
potentially endangering
other soldiers with those lies,

25:09.809 --> 25:11.978
these are serious charges.

25:12.011 --> 25:13.980
And you will need to face them
in military court.

25:14.013 --> 25:15.982
Understood, sir.

25:28.227 --> 25:31.263
This is very
cloak-and-dagger.

25:31.297 --> 25:33.199
I like it.
What's up?

25:33.232 --> 25:37.203
I know Matador isn't
Richard's code name.

25:37.236 --> 25:40.607
What are you
talking about? Richard is...

25:40.640 --> 25:41.307
Dead.

25:41.340 --> 25:43.810
He's been dead
for months.

25:43.843 --> 25:45.044
Which means he isn't the one

25:45.077 --> 25:46.112
who gave those orders
to Officer Andrew,

25:46.145 --> 25:49.181
which means he isn't Matador.
He never has been.

25:49.215 --> 25:51.584
There's only one reason
that you'd be lying to me,

25:51.618 --> 25:52.652
as far as I can tell.

25:52.685 --> 25:56.188
Richard wasn't acting alone
when he went rogue.

25:56.222 --> 25:58.090
You've been behind this
the entire time.

26:01.393 --> 26:05.164
The colonel agrees. He wants
to go to the FBI about this.

26:05.197 --> 26:08.267
With what proof?

26:08.300 --> 26:10.302
I followed the money.

26:12.004 --> 26:14.073
It's your own fault, really.

26:14.106 --> 26:16.308
You taught me there's always
a trail when money's involved,

26:16.342 --> 26:18.310
and you taught me
how to find it.

26:18.344 --> 26:21.113
So I followed the money that
was given to Officer Andrew.

26:21.147 --> 26:22.649
Traced it to a shell company.

26:22.682 --> 26:24.083
And then to another
and then to another.

26:24.116 --> 26:25.852
Until finally I got
to that little country

26:25.885 --> 26:27.654
in the West Indies.

26:27.687 --> 26:30.022
And that's where most people
would have had to stop,

26:30.056 --> 26:32.158
but I traced
that company to you.

26:35.194 --> 26:36.829
You're Matador.

26:38.364 --> 26:41.000
Uh, this-this is
very impressive.

26:42.702 --> 26:46.005
You know, i-in a weird way, I'm
actually kind of proud of you.

26:49.408 --> 26:51.711
What do you want?

26:51.744 --> 26:53.680
Sir, I respect you.

26:53.713 --> 26:55.414
Whatever you have done,

26:55.447 --> 26:58.685
you have done it for a
good reason, I am sure.

26:58.718 --> 27:00.987
Tell me what that is,

27:01.020 --> 27:03.389
and then I will help get
Haskins off your trail.

27:03.422 --> 27:05.391
Are you wearing a wire?

27:07.760 --> 27:09.428
You want to check,
be my guest.

27:09.461 --> 27:10.897
All right, well,
we need to go

27:10.930 --> 27:13.299
someplace more secure.
No, there's no time.

27:13.332 --> 27:15.067
Colonel Haskins
wants to go

27:15.101 --> 27:16.903
to the Bureau
about this right away.

27:16.936 --> 27:19.405
I convinced him to give me
an hour to do some digging.

27:19.438 --> 27:21.440
But if I don't get back
to him soon,

27:21.473 --> 27:23.242
this will all blow up.

27:28.114 --> 27:31.718
Why did you tell Richard
not to destroy the uranium?

27:31.751 --> 27:34.420
Were you selling it?
Yes.

27:35.955 --> 27:37.957
To the paramilitary wing
of Svoboda.

27:37.990 --> 27:40.392
Ukrainian white nationalists.

27:40.426 --> 27:42.428
They are a known terror group.

27:42.461 --> 27:44.931
Look, I don't agree with
all their views, okay?

27:44.964 --> 27:48.067
But we do agree on one
very important thing:

27:48.100 --> 27:52.404
radical Islam is the single
greatest threat to this planet.

27:52.438 --> 27:54.240
All right, Thea, you know
that our government's hands

27:54.273 --> 27:56.809
are tied in so many ways!

27:56.843 --> 28:00.079
If Svoboda can set off
a few dirty bombs

28:00.112 --> 28:01.781
in ISIS's biggest strongholds,

28:01.814 --> 28:03.282
they will be decimated!

28:03.315 --> 28:05.752
So the enemy of my enemy
is my friend.

28:05.785 --> 28:06.919
Is that what you are saying?

28:06.953 --> 28:08.855
I am a patriot, just like you.

28:08.888 --> 28:10.990
We are doing what is best
for our country.

28:11.023 --> 28:12.124
It didn't work!

28:12.158 --> 28:16.428
The uranium ended up in a
bomb that nearly killed you.

28:16.462 --> 28:18.731
Yeah, well, things don't
always go as planned.

28:18.765 --> 28:19.932
And when they don't,

28:19.966 --> 28:21.801
one must cover one's tracks.

28:26.372 --> 28:28.507
That's why you ordered
the hit on Gallo and Madani.

28:28.540 --> 28:29.508
You were right.

28:29.541 --> 28:32.011
Those pilots know more
than they are telling.

28:32.044 --> 28:34.747
They're a liability, Thea,
and I do not do liabilities.

28:34.781 --> 28:36.749
And Goundry?

28:36.783 --> 28:39.886
You ordered Officer Richard
to kill him in Somalia,

28:39.919 --> 28:41.020
and when he
survived that,

28:41.053 --> 28:44.190
you got the sniper to do it.

28:44.223 --> 28:45.858
You really are very good.

28:45.892 --> 28:47.493
Yeah. Yeah, I am.

28:52.498 --> 28:54.767
Oh, God, Thea.

28:56.402 --> 28:57.469
Tucker Magnus?

28:58.570 --> 28:59.972
You're under arrest.

29:04.410 --> 29:05.778
Everything we need

29:05.812 --> 29:08.047
recorded on this device
right here.

29:09.148 --> 29:10.482
You guys aren't the only ones
with neat toys.

29:13.986 --> 29:15.521
There is someone else
above you in this,

29:15.554 --> 29:16.823
isn't there?

29:16.856 --> 29:19.291
You had a double-two domino.

29:19.325 --> 29:20.827
Who's snake eyes?

29:20.860 --> 29:22.494
I don't know what
you're talking about.

29:29.601 --> 29:31.437
I just don't understand it.

29:32.604 --> 29:34.506
I need to talk to
you about something.

29:34.540 --> 29:35.842
It's about Nora.

29:35.875 --> 29:36.843
The colonel agreed

29:36.876 --> 29:38.177
that we would wait until
after the arrest to...

29:38.210 --> 29:39.078
Uh, damn it. It's my mom.

29:39.111 --> 29:40.913
She's called me, like,
five times. Hold on.

29:40.947 --> 29:42.481
Hey, what is going on?

29:42.514 --> 29:43.282
SIMONE:
I just heard

29:43.315 --> 29:44.483
they're arresting
Director Magnus.

29:44.516 --> 29:46.018
Yeah.

29:46.052 --> 29:47.419
The FBI just took him away
a minute ago.

29:47.453 --> 29:48.554
Hey, how did you even
know about that?

29:48.587 --> 29:51.157
I'm on the House Intel
Committee, son.

29:51.190 --> 29:52.424
Knowing is my job.

29:52.458 --> 29:55.261
You have any idea that he was
capable of something like this?

29:55.294 --> 29:57.864
First met him, what, last month,
when I gave him those e-mails

29:57.897 --> 30:00.032
that you so helpfully
procured for me.

30:00.066 --> 30:02.268
It's not the right time.

30:02.301 --> 30:03.335
Of course, honey.

30:03.369 --> 30:05.938
I just wanted to make sure
you're okay, you know.

30:05.972 --> 30:09.175
After this and what
happened with Nora.

30:09.208 --> 30:11.377
What happened with Nora?

30:14.213 --> 30:16.548
They're probably gonna
keep us here overnight.

30:16.582 --> 30:19.585
Good old government
efficiency.

30:21.253 --> 30:23.322
Colonel said
I could come see you.

30:25.892 --> 30:27.894
Wanted you to know the FBI
has taken Magnus into custody.

30:27.927 --> 30:31.230
So it's not for nothing.

30:31.263 --> 30:32.899
We got the bad guy.
One of them,

30:32.932 --> 30:35.067
at least.

30:35.101 --> 30:37.103
This isn't how

30:37.136 --> 30:39.906
I wanted it to end up.

30:39.939 --> 30:43.009
I think you did
the right thing over there.

30:44.576 --> 30:46.478
Both of you.

30:49.415 --> 30:51.350
I appreciate that, Porter.

30:53.519 --> 30:56.889
Um... I, uh...

30:56.923 --> 30:57.957
brought you this.

31:00.292 --> 31:01.961
Good luck charm.

31:01.994 --> 31:05.864
I figured
you might need it.

31:08.534 --> 31:11.170
Thank you.

31:21.413 --> 31:23.916
You know...

31:23.950 --> 31:25.651
you told me once,

31:25.684 --> 31:27.653
you joined up to be one of the

31:27.686 --> 31:30.489
good guys.

31:30.522 --> 31:31.557
So did I.

31:33.993 --> 31:36.963
You know, for the first
time in a while...

31:38.998 --> 31:41.233
...I really feel like I am.

31:58.384 --> 32:00.652
Jimmy?

32:13.165 --> 32:16.435
* There is a swelling storm...

32:16.468 --> 32:17.436
Jimmy?

32:19.338 --> 32:20.706
* And I'm caught up
in the middle... *

32:20.739 --> 32:22.474
I'm so sorry, I'm...

32:22.508 --> 32:26.445
I'm... I'm just not
used to the bed yet.

32:29.481 --> 32:33.085
* The person
that I thought I was *

32:33.119 --> 32:35.421
* The boy I used to know

32:37.289 --> 32:39.425
* But there is a light...

32:40.626 --> 32:42.561
Beds are overrated.

32:47.199 --> 32:50.469
This debrief I have
to do tomorrow.

32:51.470 --> 32:55.074
I... I don't think I can.

32:55.107 --> 32:56.742
* It comes and goes in waves

32:56.775 --> 32:59.145
* It always does...

32:59.178 --> 33:02.748
I'm not ready...

33:02.781 --> 33:05.151
to talk about it yet.

33:05.184 --> 33:07.353
* And the freedom
of falling... *

33:07.386 --> 33:08.587
I'm sorry.

33:08.620 --> 33:09.788
You know what?

33:09.821 --> 33:11.657
* Set in stone,
it slips through... *

33:11.690 --> 33:14.493
Then you won't.

33:14.526 --> 33:18.564
And if anybody has anything
to say about that,

33:18.597 --> 33:21.567
they can come and talk to me.

33:21.600 --> 33:23.569
Okay?

33:23.602 --> 33:25.571
* It comes and goes
in waves... *

33:25.604 --> 33:27.573
Okay.

33:27.606 --> 33:31.543
* And carries us away

33:31.577 --> 33:34.346
* Through the wind

33:34.380 --> 33:39.551
* Down to the place we used
to lay when we were kids. *

33:45.657 --> 33:47.059
GALLO:
Please tell me

33:47.093 --> 33:48.560
you're not our lawyer.

33:48.594 --> 33:50.596
You won't be needing
a lawyer. Colonel?

33:50.629 --> 33:53.399
A decision
has been made

33:53.432 --> 33:56.568
to relieve you both

33:56.602 --> 33:58.270
of your duties
as Shadow Raiders.

33:58.304 --> 34:00.106
And as officers

34:00.139 --> 34:01.540
of the United States Army.

34:01.573 --> 34:02.708
What?
We're being discharged?

34:02.741 --> 34:05.311
W

34:05.344 --> 34:07.313
Thanks to your work
uncovering Magnus's crimes,

34:07.346 --> 34:08.814
I have convinced
the powers that be

34:08.847 --> 34:10.582
that a trial isn't necessary.

34:11.783 --> 34:13.485
All charges against you
can be dropped.

34:13.519 --> 34:15.621
"Can be"

34:15.654 --> 34:16.655
You have a choice.

34:17.656 --> 34:20.126
You can take your chances
in a military court,

34:20.159 --> 34:22.828
which I can almost guarantee
will not end well,

34:22.861 --> 34:24.663
or you can come fly

34:24.696 --> 34:28.200
for a CIA Special Activities
unit under my command.

34:28.234 --> 34:30.469
Doing what, exactly?

34:30.502 --> 34:34.606
Unfortunately, not all
of the uranium was recovered.

34:34.640 --> 34:36.775
Some of it made it
to the Ukraine,

34:36.808 --> 34:39.878
as Magnus intended,
so we need to get it back.

34:39.911 --> 34:41.513
And that may require
doing some things

34:41.547 --> 34:43.782
that the Army rules won't allow.

34:43.815 --> 34:45.717
MADANI:
Sir.

34:45.751 --> 34:47.419
You're okay with this?

34:47.453 --> 34:49.555
This is not how I intended
for things to go down,

34:49.588 --> 34:51.690
but under the circumstances,

34:51.723 --> 34:52.624
I would advise you both

34:52.658 --> 34:54.326
to take the deal.

34:54.360 --> 34:56.628
You'll accomplish nothing
by sitting in prison.

34:56.662 --> 34:58.630
And if things go well
on the civilian side,

34:58.664 --> 35:01.367
then maybe we can revisit
your future here.

35:02.768 --> 35:04.736
But for now, good luck.

35:15.614 --> 35:18.584
So I assume you're in.

35:18.617 --> 35:19.785
Trust me,

35:19.818 --> 35:21.687
you'll enjoy working
for the Agency.

35:21.720 --> 35:23.722
We operate a little more freely
than you're used to.

35:23.755 --> 35:25.591
Yeah, we've noticed.

35:25.624 --> 35:28.260
Plus, we have looser rules
on fraternization, so...

35:28.294 --> 35:31.497
you can stop pretending
there's nothing between you.

35:34.633 --> 35:35.734
Okay, well, you'll be briefed
later today on the mission.

35:35.767 --> 35:37.303
Are we all clear?

35:37.336 --> 35:39.905
I don't know
what you expect us to say.

35:39.938 --> 35:42.140
"Thank you" would be nice.

35:57.856 --> 36:00.526
So now we have to go
work for the CIA,

36:00.559 --> 36:02.694
the same people who got us in
this mess in the first place.

36:02.728 --> 36:04.730
Yeah.

36:04.763 --> 36:08.300
But we'll also get
to finish what we started.

36:08.334 --> 36:09.768
I have no idea how
to feel right now.

36:09.801 --> 36:11.770
I'm with you there.

36:11.803 --> 36:14.806
But I got an idea
what might help.

36:35.394 --> 36:36.628
Hey.

36:38.530 --> 36:39.831
What?

36:39.865 --> 36:41.767
You lied to me.

36:41.800 --> 36:42.668
I'm sorry, you're
gonna have to be

36:42.701 --> 36:44.303
a little bit more
specific than that.

36:44.336 --> 36:46.972
You told me that you had
just met Magnus.

36:48.740 --> 36:51.910
I found a classified
recommendation in his file,

36:51.943 --> 36:55.847
signed by you,
from five years ago.

36:55.881 --> 36:58.717
I was protecting you.

36:58.750 --> 37:00.452
If you're going
to run for office,

37:00.486 --> 37:04.456
we can't have you dragged down
by unsavory associations.

37:04.490 --> 37:06.558
And now that Magnus
is gonna be prosecuted,

37:06.592 --> 37:07.859
the less connection the better.

37:07.893 --> 37:09.895
You are connected to him.

37:09.928 --> 37:11.763
That's why these recommendations
are classified.

37:11.797 --> 37:13.632
So no one can see them.

37:15.867 --> 37:17.369
You want a drink?

37:17.403 --> 37:19.905
What?

37:19.938 --> 37:21.840
No. Ma...

37:21.873 --> 37:24.810
I actually feel for the man.

37:24.843 --> 37:27.413
Right idea.

37:27.446 --> 37:29.014
Just went about it
the wrong way.

37:29.047 --> 37:31.317
That is a gross
understatement, Mom.

37:31.350 --> 37:32.918
Honey, I'm not saying
that I agree

37:32.951 --> 37:34.886
with his methods,
I am just saying

37:34.920 --> 37:36.855
that his heart
was in the right place.

37:36.888 --> 37:38.757
You really believe that?

37:38.790 --> 37:40.759
Ever since your father's death,
it has been clear to me

37:40.792 --> 37:43.629
that national security is the
most important responsibility

37:43.662 --> 37:45.764
of this government.

37:45.797 --> 37:47.065
You agree, don't you?

37:47.098 --> 37:51.670
Yes, of course,
but... there are limits.

37:52.838 --> 37:54.673
Yeah, I got to get back.

37:54.706 --> 37:55.974
No-- honey, look.

37:56.007 --> 37:59.811
All you need to do is
focus on your career.

37:59.845 --> 38:02.681
Tucker Magnus is going to prison
and you helped put him there.

38:02.714 --> 38:06.385
That is gonna look so good
on your résumé. Oh, my...

38:07.886 --> 38:10.556
Please.

38:10.589 --> 38:13.592
For once, trust your mother.

38:20.432 --> 38:22.300
Good-bye.

38:24.803 --> 38:26.605
All right.

38:32.778 --> 38:37.549
I heard they're finally tearing
this place down next week.

38:37.583 --> 38:39.985
Last chance
for some wall-bashing therapy.

38:42.488 --> 38:44.723
Think you can do it
with one hand?

38:44.756 --> 38:45.857
Sure as hell gonna try.

38:47.926 --> 38:50.929
We all got to do what it takes
to keep going, right?

38:52.431 --> 38:54.600
*

39:02.574 --> 39:03.742
* Time is fleeting

39:05.577 --> 39:09.848
* Passing by

39:09.881 --> 39:13.852
* All I can do

39:13.885 --> 39:17.523
* Is sit here and cry

39:17.556 --> 39:21.960
* Who'll be coming

39:21.993 --> 39:25.964
* To take my soul?

39:25.997 --> 39:30.636
* I feel so heavenly...

39:30.669 --> 39:32.137
Really, really good.

39:32.170 --> 39:33.572
I hope so.

39:33.605 --> 39:35.574
* I'm done

39:35.607 --> 39:41.046
* Starting wars

39:41.079 --> 39:45.484
* If one light be saved

39:45.517 --> 39:49.821
* For each taken away

39:49.855 --> 39:52.023
* Tell me

39:52.057 --> 39:56.495
* Why should I

39:56.528 --> 39:58.497
* Deserve

39:58.530 --> 40:02.067
* A miracle?

40:19.050 --> 40:22.053
So we take on
this mission,

40:22.087 --> 40:25.023
finish what we started.

40:25.056 --> 40:26.858
And then find a way
to get our asses back

40:26.892 --> 40:27.993
in the Army.

40:28.026 --> 40:29.194
And what Thea said,

40:29.227 --> 40:32.063
about different rules...

40:33.732 --> 40:38.169
It means we actually could
give this a shot.

40:38.203 --> 40:40.606
Us.

40:40.639 --> 40:41.807
Hey.

40:42.841 --> 40:45.611
You still with me?

40:50.782 --> 40:53.585
A lot has happened
in the last few months.

40:57.122 --> 41:01.159
I just need time
to process all of it.

41:03.662 --> 41:06.231
Figure things out on my own.

41:10.001 --> 41:12.003
Okay.

41:15.907 --> 41:18.009
We make a great team.

41:19.244 --> 41:21.146
We fly so well
together.

41:22.180 --> 41:23.582
Yeah.

41:24.850 --> 41:26.585
We do.

41:26.618 --> 41:31.089
I just don't want anything
to get in the way of that.

41:37.929 --> 41:40.932
She's calling us in
for the briefing.

41:46.705 --> 41:49.240
Let's get to work.
