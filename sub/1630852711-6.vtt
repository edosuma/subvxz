WEBVTT

00:14.583 --> 00:16.125
Never pays attention to me.

00:16.208 --> 00:17.708
He never even looks at me.

00:17.791 --> 00:20.833
I just never feel like I'm being noticed.

00:21.333 --> 00:22.166
My child.

00:22.666 --> 00:24.833
- You've already told me about this.
- I know.

00:26.291 --> 00:28.291
- But it was your choice though.
- Yeah.

00:28.375 --> 00:30.125
And I even agreed with you.

00:31.041 --> 00:33.166
I don't understand what the problem is.

00:35.333 --> 00:38.166
I think that the problem is
I'm still in love with Salvo.

00:38.666 --> 00:40.083
I HATE YOU

00:40.166 --> 00:41.083
YOU SUCK

00:46.125 --> 00:47.500
YOU'RE RIDICULOUS

00:47.583 --> 00:49.041
YOU'RE PATHETIC

00:54.250 --> 00:55.541
Hey, Chief.

00:55.625 --> 00:57.750
- We're ready for you.
- Thank you.

01:38.791 --> 01:42.041
I have to say I think
this additional request of yours

01:42.125 --> 01:44.500
- will definitely cost you more.
- Give me your cell phone.

01:46.625 --> 01:47.458
Come on.

01:48.166 --> 01:49.083
Yours as well.

01:49.166 --> 01:51.375
Let's go! Give me your phones!

01:55.375 --> 01:56.291
No!

01:56.375 --> 01:58.416
No! Wh-- What is he doing?

02:00.875 --> 02:02.208
I beg you. I beg you.

02:02.291 --> 02:03.916
- Please! Don't hurt us.
- What is he doing?

02:04.000 --> 02:06.541
- We did everything you asked us to!
- What are you doing? Get up.

02:06.625 --> 02:09.541
I'm begging you.
I'm begging you. Please don't hurt us.

02:09.625 --> 02:13.125
Come on. Get up.
You're making us look so bad right now!

02:13.208 --> 02:14.541
What the hell was that?

02:15.583 --> 02:17.541
The third GPS has been activated too.

02:17.625 --> 02:18.958
Oh, very good.

02:19.041 --> 02:20.416
Very good.

02:22.625 --> 02:23.666
Lo Russo.

02:24.291 --> 02:26.375
Lo Russo, we've got their location.

02:26.458 --> 02:27.625
Yeah, yeah, I got it, boss.

02:27.708 --> 02:29.583
We've received the signals.

02:29.666 --> 02:31.416
- Let's go!
- All right, let's go.

02:42.958 --> 02:44.458
Pull the bag down over your face.

02:44.541 --> 02:46.333
- Do we have to?
- Yes, do it right now!

02:46.416 --> 02:47.500
Be quiet.

02:47.583 --> 02:48.791
Now stay quiet!

02:51.500 --> 02:54.291
- One of the signals isn't moving.

02:54.375 --> 02:56.708
Huh. Maybe they had to change clothes.

02:57.666 --> 02:58.500
Lo Russo?

02:58.583 --> 03:00.958
Lo Russo, we've lost the signal.

03:01.041 --> 03:02.750
I've got eyes on them.

03:02.833 --> 03:04.708
Tonino Macaluso is driving.

03:08.833 --> 03:11.083
Can we at least open a window, please?

03:11.166 --> 03:12.291
I can't breathe.

03:12.375 --> 03:13.875
Will you be quiet?

03:13.958 --> 03:15.958
Shut up! Shut up!

03:19.500 --> 03:21.083
They're not that far from us.

03:22.125 --> 03:24.583
Let's not get too close.
We don't want to be spotted.

03:32.708 --> 03:36.291
- Be careful, Lo Russo. This could be it.
- <i>Yes, we can see it.</i>

03:36.375 --> 03:37.625
We're gonna follow them.

03:38.625 --> 03:39.541
Hold on.

03:40.333 --> 03:41.958
They're driving a different car now.

03:44.333 --> 03:45.166
Ugh.

03:45.708 --> 03:47.333
We've lost the second signal now.

03:47.416 --> 03:49.375
We've lost the second signal now.

03:49.458 --> 03:51.583
Will it take long
to get there?

03:51.666 --> 03:54.041
No, you…

03:54.125 --> 03:56.250
We're almost… there.

03:56.333 --> 03:59.708
Another five minutes. Five minutes or so…
and… we'll be there.

04:11.625 --> 04:12.458
Hold on.

04:33.916 --> 04:36.416
Macaluso is making sure
that no one is following him.

04:36.500 --> 04:38.083
Don't lose sight of him.

04:48.791 --> 04:50.416
Have a sandwich.

05:01.208 --> 05:03.250
What are they talking about over there?

05:04.625 --> 05:07.416
So have you known
the Holy Father for a long time?

05:07.500 --> 05:08.416
I have.

05:09.333 --> 05:12.833
And I've always…
I've always been Useless Thing to him.

05:13.875 --> 05:15.875
Why does everyone call you Useless Thing?

05:17.958 --> 05:19.375
It was a mistake.

05:20.125 --> 05:22.791
It was just a stupid mistake.

05:24.541 --> 05:27.708
I was about ten years old,
just like the Holy Father.

05:28.916 --> 05:31.000
And on that damn day,

05:32.000 --> 05:33.125
he was there.

05:41.041 --> 05:43.541
And I'm still not convinced.

05:43.625 --> 05:46.208
You need to have more conviction

05:46.291 --> 05:48.750
and learn it by heart, Tonino!

05:49.625 --> 05:51.291
Start from the beginning.

05:52.500 --> 05:56.208
I believe in one God,
the Father, the Almighty.

05:56.291 --> 05:58.791
He is the maker of heaven and the earth.

06:01.666 --> 06:06.250
I believe in one God.

06:06.333 --> 06:09.166
He is the maker of heaven and the e…

06:12.708 --> 06:13.833
Tonino!

06:14.458 --> 06:16.791
Start over from the beginning!

06:19.500 --> 06:23.666
I believe in one God,
the Father, the Almighty.

06:23.750 --> 06:26.541
He is the maker of heaven and the earth.

06:27.250 --> 06:31.750
I believe in one God, Fa…

06:31.833 --> 06:33.583
the… of heaven…

06:36.541 --> 06:37.875
Tonino!

06:37.958 --> 06:39.916
You are just a little useless thing!

06:40.000 --> 06:44.041
You're a useless thing.
You're a useless thing.

06:44.125 --> 06:46.583
Tonino is just a useless thing.

06:46.666 --> 06:50.000
You're a useless thing.
You're a useless thing.

06:50.083 --> 06:51.500
Just a useless thing.

06:51.583 --> 06:53.541
You're just a little useless thing!

06:54.125 --> 06:57.000
- You're a useless thing.
- A useless thing!

06:57.083 --> 06:58.833
You're just a useless thing!

07:01.000 --> 07:02.875
And from that day on, I became

07:03.750 --> 07:05.583
Useless Thing to everyone.

07:09.000 --> 07:11.416
One day, I'll succeed. Ha.

07:11.916 --> 07:14.500
One day, I'll succeed
in becoming a great boss,

07:14.583 --> 07:16.875
like the Holy Father. I know it.

07:16.958 --> 07:18.375
Don't worry about it, Tonino.

07:18.458 --> 07:21.750
Once all this is sorted, we'll put in
a good a word with the Holy Father.

07:21.833 --> 07:25.541
Sure…
I'm sure you'll put in a good… word

07:25.625 --> 07:29.833
with… the Holy Father.

07:29.916 --> 07:31.541
Of course. Of course.

07:31.625 --> 07:32.458
My panini?

07:37.916 --> 07:40.000
- They're leaving. Come on. Let's move.
- Come on.

07:47.875 --> 07:50.166
They changed cars again. Go.

08:30.541 --> 08:32.000
What are you doing here?

08:34.125 --> 08:35.875
I'll take these two.

08:36.875 --> 08:38.291
But the Holy Father…

08:38.375 --> 08:39.333
Tss…

08:40.541 --> 08:42.291
The Holy Father says

08:43.791 --> 08:45.708
that this is your new mission.

08:53.583 --> 08:54.833
I have to do this?

08:54.916 --> 08:57.333
What's wrong? Are you not happy?

08:58.291 --> 09:01.166
Sure… I'm g…

09:01.250 --> 09:03.583
- g…
- G-- G-- G--

09:03.666 --> 09:04.875
…good with it.

09:22.583 --> 09:23.583
That's them.

09:24.500 --> 09:26.958
- And they've changed their car once again.
- Let's move out.

09:53.791 --> 09:55.541
Hey, Tonino. Come on.

09:55.625 --> 09:57.458
You've been taking us
all over all day long.

09:57.541 --> 09:59.625
Tonino, what are we even doing?

10:07.625 --> 10:08.791
It's all set.

10:26.833 --> 10:27.750
We're here.

10:27.833 --> 10:29.791
- Smell the sautéed garlic?
- Yes.

10:29.875 --> 10:31.875
So if the police burst in,
get down on the floor.

10:31.958 --> 10:33.166
They'll be right behind us.

10:33.250 --> 10:35.958
- All right. All right.
- Remember, stay calm.

11:00.166 --> 11:01.416
- But you are…

11:04.041 --> 11:08.083
Mr. Gambino,
it's Mr. Martorana, the doorman.

11:08.750 --> 11:10.250
You remember me.

11:14.708 --> 11:16.041
The doorman.

11:19.250 --> 11:20.791
Excellent observation.

11:21.708 --> 11:25.416
It's my opinion
that in life, I think

11:25.916 --> 11:30.916
that if you have something to hide
like an object or a person,

11:31.750 --> 11:33.875
you need to keep it visible

11:33.958 --> 11:35.791
so that everyone sees it,

11:36.333 --> 11:37.958
but no one looks at it.

11:38.041 --> 11:40.916
Who looks at a doorman, huh?

11:42.041 --> 11:45.291
And, you know, I have to protect myself

11:45.375 --> 11:47.375
because, you know…

11:49.708 --> 11:51.875
there are traitors everywhere.

11:57.250 --> 11:59.583
- Where the hell are the police at?
- I don't know.

11:59.666 --> 12:02.291
All right. So tell me.

12:02.375 --> 12:05.583
Which one of my men is the traitor?

12:05.666 --> 12:10.000
Who of my men is it
that wants to get me to get arrested.

12:11.708 --> 12:12.875
Lying

12:13.791 --> 12:16.041
won't help you get away.

12:16.125 --> 12:17.791
The truth will catch you.

12:17.875 --> 12:20.375
Look, I think you've got it all wrong.

12:20.458 --> 12:22.541
The two of us, we're good people.

12:22.625 --> 12:24.208
- You can ask anyone.
- Yeah.

12:24.291 --> 12:26.375
- You can even ask Tonino. He knows.
- Uh-huh.

12:26.458 --> 12:29.750
- Tonino!
- Unfortunately, Tonino can't confirm that.

12:30.916 --> 12:32.041
Tonino isn't here.

12:32.125 --> 12:33.208
Where did he go?

12:33.291 --> 12:35.500
Let's just say he's been assigned

12:36.666 --> 12:38.750
to a more sensitive case.

12:44.541 --> 12:47.333
You won't find onions like these
in the whole of Sicily.

12:47.416 --> 12:50.291
These are wonderful, especially sautéed.

12:50.375 --> 12:51.500
All right. Thanks.

12:52.458 --> 12:53.583
There you go.

12:57.583 --> 13:00.875
ONIONS, TOMATOES, SALTED RICOTTA,
SALT, BASIL, WINE, COOKIES

13:06.208 --> 13:09.666
Brother,
there is still time for you to repent.

13:09.750 --> 13:11.166
Lift up your bags.

13:14.333 --> 13:15.458
You agreed

13:16.125 --> 13:17.333
that you would stay quiet.

13:17.958 --> 13:18.833
Yes.

13:18.916 --> 13:22.833
I hope you don't mind
this little change of plan.

13:22.916 --> 13:24.041
Uh…

13:24.125 --> 13:27.250
You always need
to be ready for any changes

13:28.250 --> 13:29.083
because,

13:29.875 --> 13:32.083
in life, things often change.

13:32.625 --> 13:34.708
They change all the time.

13:36.625 --> 13:39.625
Just look at how many things
have changed for us

13:39.708 --> 13:41.083
over the years.

13:41.583 --> 13:42.583
Now, we

13:43.625 --> 13:46.916
are being forced to hide
like dirty sewer rats.

13:48.166 --> 13:53.041
We are forced to do other crappy jobs
just to make enough money.

13:54.291 --> 13:56.875
But it's not just
because of the recession.

13:56.958 --> 13:57.875
No.

13:58.500 --> 13:59.875
It's our fault,

14:01.041 --> 14:04.041
because we made mistakes years ago.

14:05.708 --> 14:08.958
We made too much noise.

14:10.291 --> 14:12.000
Too many explosions.

14:13.708 --> 14:18.125
And we forced politicians,
who had always been on our side,

14:18.833 --> 14:20.916
to put on a fake show.

14:21.750 --> 14:25.166
Arrests and trials and laws against us.

14:25.750 --> 14:26.875
A facade!

14:27.958 --> 14:29.166
Well, but people

14:29.958 --> 14:31.750
like shows like that.

14:31.833 --> 14:34.958
- People believe in shows like that.

14:36.083 --> 14:37.041
And so,

14:38.791 --> 14:42.875
Today we must face the fact
that people turn to politicians

14:43.875 --> 14:48.375
for the solution to problems
we used to solve for the public

14:48.458 --> 14:52.083
and that now,
we aren't able to solve those things.

14:52.166 --> 14:55.375
Today Cosa Nostra must accept

14:55.958 --> 14:58.250
the supremacy of politics.

15:00.000 --> 15:01.750
They got their hands on everything.

15:02.458 --> 15:05.500
Public trading, tax collection,

15:06.083 --> 15:08.875
municipally-owned corporations, hospitals.

15:08.958 --> 15:10.958
We've come to the point

15:12.333 --> 15:16.250
where politicians
will nominate candidates electors.

15:16.916 --> 15:19.875
And we're forced to give them our vote,

15:20.666 --> 15:22.166
choosing the best of the worst.

15:24.250 --> 15:25.541
But I'm sure

15:27.000 --> 15:28.291
sooner or later

15:29.666 --> 15:30.916
things

15:31.000 --> 15:33.583
will go back to the old ways.

15:35.000 --> 15:36.208
We just need

15:37.291 --> 15:39.125
to be patient

15:40.583 --> 15:41.750
for people

15:43.041 --> 15:44.041
to forget.

15:49.166 --> 15:53.375
And if there's one thing
history can teach us,

15:53.916 --> 15:55.291
it's that people,

15:56.333 --> 15:57.750
eventually…

15:59.708 --> 16:01.166
will forget.

16:01.833 --> 16:03.125
Speaking of that,

16:03.208 --> 16:06.208
I think you left
the eggplant on the stove.

16:06.291 --> 16:08.916
Well, go get them. Don't let them burn.

16:13.458 --> 16:15.750
I'll tell you a nice story now.

16:17.666 --> 16:18.583
You see this

16:20.291 --> 16:23.500
poor computer belongs to Gambino.

16:24.500 --> 16:25.791
May he rest in peace.

16:31.208 --> 16:32.500
Something's not right.

16:33.083 --> 16:35.416
It seems to me like everything's okay.

16:36.750 --> 16:38.416
What's concerning you?

16:39.541 --> 16:43.250
He's got two captives in the car
and he's going around buying tomatoes?

16:43.833 --> 16:47.083
You'll see this computer
had a lot of interesting things on it.

16:47.166 --> 16:50.583
This file, especially.
It's kind of a diary,

16:50.666 --> 16:53.541
because he needed to vent.
Poor Gambino.

16:54.416 --> 16:55.458
Listen to this.

16:57.208 --> 17:01.166
"For years I have spent
my time serving the Holy Father."

17:01.250 --> 17:03.625
"I've been taking care
of his business daily."

17:03.708 --> 17:06.125
"I've been advising him
on his investments,

17:06.208 --> 17:08.208
and I've helped him to pay less taxes,"

17:08.291 --> 17:11.625
because, you know, taxes
are the real problem in this country.

17:11.708 --> 17:12.958
- Oh yes, we know.
- Yeah.

17:13.041 --> 17:15.958
"The Holy Father
would never have suspected me

17:16.041 --> 17:20.291
"because I have been taking small amounts
of his money here and there."

17:21.166 --> 17:23.625
"In fact, no one would've found out

17:23.708 --> 17:28.125
"until someone found me and presented me
with a hefty bill owing money."

17:28.708 --> 17:33.583
"This stranger started to blackmail me
more and more each day."

17:33.666 --> 17:36.666
"With increasingly exorbitant demands
for money,

17:36.750 --> 17:39.916
"he would threaten me
and make sure I knew that if I didn't pay,

17:40.000 --> 17:42.208
he'd tell the Holy Father
what I was doing!"

17:42.708 --> 17:46.291
You won't find salted ricotta like this
in all of Sicily.

17:46.875 --> 17:47.833
Is it perfect?

17:47.916 --> 17:51.958
If you want, you can talk
to the very sheep I got it from.

17:59.625 --> 18:00.750
You're two euros short.

18:01.666 --> 18:02.500
Really?

18:09.916 --> 18:11.416
- There you go.
- Thank you.

18:15.541 --> 18:17.583
I'll take these for free.

18:23.583 --> 18:24.708
Something's not right.

18:24.791 --> 18:26.166
What do you mean?

18:26.250 --> 18:28.333
Valentino doesn't eat any cheese.

18:33.458 --> 18:36.208
Prosecutor, the signal has stopped moving.
We've lost it.

18:36.791 --> 18:38.208
Ugh! Don't lose sight of them.

18:38.291 --> 18:40.291
Salvo and Valentino's lives
are in your hands!

18:40.375 --> 18:42.041
They're lives are in your hands.

18:42.125 --> 18:44.875
"Since this stranger kept blackmailing me,

18:44.958 --> 18:49.166
"I started to collaborate
and give information to the police,

18:49.750 --> 18:51.041
"because I understood

18:51.125 --> 18:54.833
"that that was the only way
to save myself."

18:54.916 --> 18:56.833
He didn't really understand
that well though.

18:56.916 --> 19:00.083
You, however, do you get it?

19:00.166 --> 19:02.291
- Yes.
- Yeah, well… yes.

19:02.375 --> 19:06.250
Well, Gambino was being blackmailed
by someone who was asking him for money

19:06.333 --> 19:10.291
- in exchange for their silence.
- Yeah. That's it in a nutshell.

19:10.375 --> 19:11.916
- Bravo.

19:12.000 --> 19:14.041
And to get out of this blackmail,

19:14.125 --> 19:15.583
tell me, what did he do?

19:15.666 --> 19:19.208
Uh, well he went
to the police for protection.

19:19.291 --> 19:21.375
- Big mistake. Huh? Right?
- Of course.

19:21.458 --> 19:23.083
And what is the significance?

19:23.166 --> 19:24.541
Well, he repented.

19:25.083 --> 19:26.583
- Hmm.
- Excuse my vulgarness.

19:26.666 --> 19:28.083
Of course.

19:28.166 --> 19:30.375
And what is the significance?

19:31.583 --> 19:34.958
That there isn't anyone in the Cu…

19:35.041 --> 19:36.166
In the courier!

19:36.250 --> 19:37.375
In the <i>Cupola!</i>

19:38.125 --> 19:40.166
The <i>Cupola</i> ! Yes. Yes.
The <i>Cupola</i> , sure, sure.

19:40.250 --> 19:41.791
Who wants to in…

19:41.875 --> 19:43.000
Intervene!

19:43.083 --> 19:43.958
Integrate!

19:44.041 --> 19:45.583
Incriminate me!

19:45.666 --> 19:48.666
Mm, incriminate!
Aye, that was an easy one. Incriminate!

19:48.750 --> 19:54.375
So now you know
there are no traitors allowed in my house,

19:54.458 --> 19:56.458
apart from Gambino, of course.

19:57.041 --> 19:59.041
And you are…

19:59.125 --> 20:00.125
Two.

20:00.208 --> 20:01.166
Bravo.

20:02.125 --> 20:03.125
Two…

20:04.833 --> 20:05.708
Dead men!

20:05.791 --> 20:07.500
We're two dead men! Dead!

20:08.166 --> 20:09.708
- Dead mean?
- Bravo.

20:11.000 --> 20:12.666
We didn't need this.

20:12.750 --> 20:14.625
Prosecutor, we have to intervene.

20:14.708 --> 20:17.125
They found out that Ester
is hiding in the monastery.

20:17.208 --> 20:20.250
Not necessarily, Prosecutor.
It might be a coincidence.

20:20.333 --> 20:23.458
It's possible Tonino could be there
for some other reason.

20:24.333 --> 20:25.541
How can I help you?

20:26.375 --> 20:30.166
I'd… I'd like to buy one of those packets
of pastries, almond flavor.

20:30.708 --> 20:32.000
The ones that you make.

20:32.083 --> 20:35.416
Yes, all right, however,
we only sell to believers.

20:36.125 --> 20:37.291
Are you a believer?

20:38.708 --> 20:42.583
Sure. Sure.

20:42.666 --> 20:44.333
Prosecutor, I'm going in.

20:44.416 --> 20:45.333
No!

20:45.416 --> 20:46.291
Damn it.

20:46.375 --> 20:48.416
<i>Prosecutor, if we intervene now,</i>

20:48.500 --> 20:50.666
<i>the whole operation</i>
<i>will have been for nothing.</i>

20:52.833 --> 20:55.625
Lo Russo, I think
we need to take this risk.

20:55.708 --> 20:57.750
<i>I'll take responsibility for it.</i>

21:03.333 --> 21:07.291
Brother Armando, no offense, but
these pastries don't taste like anything.

21:07.375 --> 21:10.916
We took out the refined sugar
because it's bad for you.

21:11.000 --> 21:12.833
All doctors say so nowadays.

21:12.916 --> 21:14.583
We used rice malt instead.

21:15.083 --> 21:16.500
What are you doing here?

21:16.583 --> 21:17.791
- Hmm?

21:18.291 --> 21:20.250
You're far too alive to be dead. Come on!

21:20.333 --> 21:22.041
- And who are you?
- Come with me.

21:22.625 --> 21:24.583
- Come with me!
- Where are we going?

21:24.666 --> 21:27.125
- You'll just see where you're going.

21:27.208 --> 21:29.458
You and your little friend
are finished talking bullshit.

21:29.541 --> 21:32.041
- What have you done to my husband?
- Keep walking!

21:32.125 --> 21:35.458
Or I'll kill you here
and make you sing "Finestra Chiusa."

21:37.583 --> 21:39.833
I told you.
They were here for her.

21:40.666 --> 21:42.541
Prosecutor, they've got Ester.

21:42.625 --> 21:44.083
I'd say it's time to intervene.

21:44.166 --> 21:47.541
Just as I thought! The people in the car
aren't Salvo and Valentino.

21:47.625 --> 21:50.000
<i>Prosecutor, if we follow him,</i>
<i>he'll take us straight to them.</i>

21:50.083 --> 21:52.541
It's our only hope
of saving Salvo and Valentino.

21:52.625 --> 21:54.666
Yes, but, Prosecutor,
we have to intervene.

21:54.750 --> 21:55.916
There are civilians in danger.

21:56.000 --> 21:58.708
Are you gonna take responsibility
for Salvo and Valentino's dying?

21:58.791 --> 22:00.666
<i>Well, these people are civilians too.</i>

22:00.750 --> 22:02.833
Yes. But, Prosecutor, they're still alive.

22:02.916 --> 22:04.375
And we can still save everyone.

22:05.500 --> 22:06.666
Lo Russo,

22:08.041 --> 22:10.083
I think we should listen to Mrs. Scalia.

22:13.166 --> 22:14.583
Go, Crisafulli!

22:17.000 --> 22:18.000
Quickly!

22:18.083 --> 22:19.083
Drive!

22:19.166 --> 22:20.208
Come on! Go!

22:20.291 --> 22:21.125
Quickly!

22:21.208 --> 22:22.166
What are you doing?

22:22.250 --> 22:24.000
- Why are you doing this to us? Why?
- Please!

22:24.083 --> 22:26.708
I know this has got
nothing to do with you.

22:26.791 --> 22:27.916
Please! No!

22:28.000 --> 22:31.208
This was my friend's idea, the prosecutor.

22:31.875 --> 22:34.708
You see, he's still suffering terribly

22:34.791 --> 22:38.500
for the tragic death
of his friend and colleague.

22:38.583 --> 22:40.666
We risk being seen at this speed.

22:40.750 --> 22:43.458
I know, Lo Russo.
But that's a risk we will have to take.

22:43.541 --> 22:45.250
After that curve up there, turn.

22:46.750 --> 22:47.916
Turn there.

22:57.541 --> 22:58.416
Hey, boss.

22:58.500 --> 23:01.625
Useless Thing,
what the fuck are you doing here now?!

23:02.208 --> 23:03.083
It's Ester!

23:04.625 --> 23:06.000
Do you know who this is?

23:06.666 --> 23:09.875
This woman is the wife
of that damn cuckold.

23:09.958 --> 23:11.791
And you two are traitors.

23:20.791 --> 23:24.541
Inspector Jackson!

23:50.000 --> 23:52.541
- Ah! Don't shoot! Don't shoot!
- Go! Let's go!

23:52.625 --> 23:54.791
-  We're going in! In! In!
- Inside!

23:56.500 --> 23:57.458
On your knees!

23:57.541 --> 23:59.291
On your knees! Get down now!

23:59.375 --> 24:01.250
- Get down!
- Get on the ground!

24:07.416 --> 24:10.666
Oh, God, You've been good to Your people,

24:10.750 --> 24:12.416
just has You promised.

24:12.500 --> 24:15.375
Psalm 119:65.

24:15.958 --> 24:17.500
Are you believers?

24:41.750 --> 24:44.541
Ha! I told you you had a thing for her.

24:44.625 --> 24:45.833
Come on.

24:49.125 --> 24:51.333
But, guys, they won't let me
graduate in September now.

24:51.958 --> 24:54.750
I knew I wasn't gonna be able
to install those doors.

24:55.708 --> 24:56.875
You can come out.

24:59.416 --> 25:00.416
You okay?

25:00.500 --> 25:01.416
I'm fine.

25:02.500 --> 25:03.500
Are you okay?

25:04.541 --> 25:05.541
I'm fine.

25:10.083 --> 25:11.416
Don't you have anything to say?

25:13.916 --> 25:14.750
No.

25:16.916 --> 25:18.791
Why don't you ask me
that question right now?

25:19.458 --> 25:21.208
- Which one?
- If I was in love.

25:22.208 --> 25:23.208
Well, but…

25:24.375 --> 25:25.916
I don't know if that's important.

25:27.375 --> 25:29.000
Well, I didn't love him.

25:30.333 --> 25:32.791
But at that moment,
I didn't love you either.

25:35.666 --> 25:36.666
Anyway,

25:37.708 --> 25:40.250
if you're still interested at all…

25:44.166 --> 25:46.041
I have realized I still love you.

25:54.750 --> 25:56.916
Listen. Now I wanna ask you a question.

25:57.000 --> 25:58.083
Yeah, ask me.

25:58.791 --> 26:00.666
Which of the two is more important to you:

26:01.750 --> 26:05.583
that I cheated or… or that you
could've actually lost me forever?

26:06.750 --> 26:07.791
What do you mean?

26:07.875 --> 26:10.333
That's what you asked me
when I found out about the cashier.

26:17.708 --> 26:19.041
I'm sorry, Ester.

26:19.125 --> 26:20.625
I… I can't. I can't do this.

26:21.125 --> 26:22.000
Forgive me.

26:25.583 --> 26:27.125
- You okay?
- Yes. Yes.

26:34.125 --> 26:34.958
Hello?

26:35.041 --> 26:37.875
I… I need details. Say something.

26:39.625 --> 26:41.875
He's not here. He got away somehow.

26:57.083 --> 27:00.125
SOME TIME LATER

27:11.916 --> 27:15.166
APPLIANCE SERVICING AND REPAIRS

27:16.333 --> 27:18.416
Anyway, I'll tell you one thing.

27:18.500 --> 27:21.875
I've had enough with TV series.
I don't want anything to do with them.

27:21.958 --> 27:23.500
- Finally
- I'm done.

27:24.166 --> 27:26.750
I'm telling you.
I gave my TV away. Now it's over.

27:26.833 --> 27:28.416
I told you you had to do that.

27:28.500 --> 27:32.083
Yes, but without the TV,
the evening always passes by so slow.

27:32.166 --> 27:34.208
Well, you'll get used to it
sooner or later.

27:34.291 --> 27:36.041
So why don't you move in with me?

27:36.625 --> 27:37.666
I can't do that.

27:37.750 --> 27:39.375
You know, I'm moving in with Agata.

27:39.458 --> 27:40.916
- Oh yeah?
- Yeah.

27:41.000 --> 27:43.541
We're just waiting for her son
to come back so we can tell him.

27:44.125 --> 27:45.666
Does your mother approve?

27:46.208 --> 27:48.500
Do you really need to be so sarcastic?

27:48.583 --> 27:51.208
All right, but in the meantime,
you could come stay with me.

27:51.291 --> 27:53.291
If you think about it,
we're both single again.

27:53.375 --> 27:55.833
I've broken up with Ester.
You've broken up with your mother.

27:55.916 --> 27:57.208
We might as well enjoy it, right?

27:57.291 --> 27:59.208
I'm sorry. Was I married to my mother?

27:59.291 --> 28:01.041
Oh, you were just dating then?

28:02.541 --> 28:05.083
Look at this guy
with his 100-year-old cart.

28:05.166 --> 28:06.791
He's gonna get somebody killed.

28:06.875 --> 28:08.166
Just go passed the guy.

28:08.250 --> 28:10.458
Pass him! Come on. Pass him! Go! Go!

28:11.875 --> 28:12.916
Whatever.

28:13.708 --> 28:16.416
Hey, say hi to Don Vito Corleone!

28:23.791 --> 28:25.541
<i>We can't help but wonder.</i>

28:25.625 --> 28:30.541
<i>After the events of a few days ago,</i>
<i>will there be a new war between the Mafia?</i>

28:30.625 --> 28:34.458
<i>The mystery of the Gambino murder</i>
<i>still remains unsolved.</i>

28:34.541 --> 28:36.750
By the way,
I couldn't get to sleep the other night

28:36.833 --> 28:40.583
because I kept thinking about
one small detail in the back of my mind.

28:40.666 --> 28:41.500
What's that?

28:41.583 --> 28:44.083
You know,
when we went into Gambino's house,

28:44.166 --> 28:46.916
his television was working.
I mean, I could turned it on.

28:47.000 --> 28:49.041
- So what?
- So it's strange, man!

28:49.125 --> 28:52.250
If the television was working,
why did he call us?

28:53.625 --> 28:55.000
What are you trying to say, Salvo?

28:55.083 --> 28:56.666
That it's strange, man. It's strange.

28:56.750 --> 29:01.083
If I were the killer, I would've made it
so that two people like us

29:01.166 --> 29:04.666
were in just the right place
at just the right time to frame them.

29:04.750 --> 29:08.833
Salvo, you promised me that you'd stop it
with the whole "if I were the killer…

29:08.916 --> 29:10.125
- Hey! Watch out!

29:26.041 --> 29:28.541
There's no one here, man.
Reverse and we'll run for it.

29:28.625 --> 29:30.666
When we get home,
we'll get rid of all the evidence.

29:30.750 --> 29:32.875
I saw it done in the prequel
to <i>The</i> <i>Touch of the Killer.</i>

29:32.958 --> 29:34.125
Prequel?

29:34.208 --> 29:35.250
<i>The Look of the Killer.</i>

29:35.333 --> 29:36.333
Are you stupid?

29:36.416 --> 29:38.875
Have you not put me through
enough trouble already?

29:38.958 --> 29:40.833
This time, we're doing it my way.

29:41.958 --> 29:42.791
Oh.
