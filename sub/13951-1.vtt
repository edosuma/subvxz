03:08.280 --> 03:11.365
"And the Raven,
never flitting, still is sitting,

03:11.491 --> 03:15.828
still is sitting on the pallid bust of Pallas
just above my chamber door.

03:15.912 --> 03:20.458
And his eyes have all the seeming
of a demon's that is dreaming.

03:20.584 --> 03:24.462
And the lamplight o'er him streaming
throws his shadow on the floor.

03:24.588 --> 03:29.633
And my soul from out that shadow
that lies floating on the floor

03:29.760 --> 03:32.178
shall be lifted never more."

03:35.307 --> 03:40.895
Pretty good, huh? OK. I want you to
read the "Legend of Sleepy Hollow".

03:41.021 --> 03:42.104
You're gonna like it.

03:42.230 --> 03:45.524
It's about a schoolteacher who
gets chased by a headless demon.

03:54.701 --> 03:55.659
Hi.

03:58.955 --> 04:01.624
Can teachers be expelled
for kissing in the hallway?

04:01.750 --> 04:04.126
- They get fired.
- Thank God it's Friday!

04:04.252 --> 04:07.588
You sound like one of my students.
Why don't you carry my books?

04:07.672 --> 04:12.051
I hope you haven't made
any plans for this afternoon.

04:12.135 --> 04:13.219
Ooh! Where are we going?

04:13.303 --> 04:14.595
It's a surprise.

04:50.799 --> 04:52.049
You OK?

04:55.929 --> 04:57.138
What's wrong?

04:57.222 --> 05:01.016
I don't know.
Didn't use to bother me.

05:01.143 --> 05:03.227
Enjoy the ride folks?

05:15.449 --> 05:16.866
That's it, take it away.

05:52.235 --> 05:55.029
- Do you want to come in?
- Better not.

05:56.990 --> 06:00.743
- Are you alright?
- I'm OK.

06:07.709 --> 06:09.668
I had a wonderful time.

06:16.676 --> 06:21.847
Are you sure you don't want to come
in? You could spend the night here.

06:25.560 --> 06:27.061
Better not.

06:28.939 --> 06:31.357
Some things
are worth waiting for.

06:36.696 --> 06:37.446
My books!

06:44.579 --> 06:45.704
Johnny, wait!

06:54.798 --> 06:56.298
I'm so crazy about you.

06:56.424 --> 06:58.926
I'm going to marry you, you know?

06:59.010 --> 07:01.053
You'd better.

07:13.358 --> 07:15.609
- Drive carefully.
- I will.

09:09.099 --> 09:10.933
Where's intensive care?

09:36.668 --> 09:42.715
Johnny.
Johnny don't leave me please.

09:46.720 --> 09:48.804
Johnny you're going to get better.
I know you are.

09:52.267 --> 09:54.685
Can you hear me?

09:57.814 --> 10:00.441
We're gonna get married,
Johnny don't leave me.

10:55.413 --> 11:02.503
Hello John. My name's Weizak.
I'm Dr Sam Weizak.

11:02.587 --> 11:09.092
I'm the director of this clinic.
You've been our guest here for a while.

11:10.053 --> 11:16.975
Guest? Funny way of putting it.

11:18.645 --> 11:20.187
How do you feel?

11:23.233 --> 11:25.234
My throat hurts.

11:29.447 --> 11:32.157
Try a bit of water. Come.

11:38.373 --> 11:41.041
Hey, slow down.
Not so fast, slow down.

11:49.717 --> 11:55.722
You've been involved in a terrible
traffic accident. Do you remember?

11:59.143 --> 12:00.686
Am I OK?

12:02.981 --> 12:07.734
Well... You've been
smashed up pretty badly.

12:12.240 --> 12:14.533
What is it?

12:25.169 --> 12:27.274
No bandages.

12:31.842 --> 12:33.788
How come?

12:36.681 --> 12:39.641
Your parents are here.
They're right next door.

12:39.767 --> 12:43.645
I'm going to bring them in now.
Is that OK?

12:45.398 --> 12:46.189
Sure.

12:52.155 --> 12:53.864
Do come in.

12:58.745 --> 13:01.288
- Hi, Mom. Dad.
- John.

13:04.876 --> 13:08.962
Johnny, Johnny...

13:12.300 --> 13:14.051
It's a miracle, John.

13:14.985 --> 13:16.931
I know.

13:16.987 --> 13:21.060
I was lucky. Look.

13:22.159 --> 13:24.105
Not a scratch.

13:27.398 --> 13:30.233
The Lord has delivered you
from your trance.

13:30.360 --> 13:33.195
Remember what we discussed,
Mrs Smith, please.

13:36.240 --> 13:37.491
What's she talking about?

13:40.578 --> 13:44.539
You've been in a coma,
Johnny, not a trance.

13:44.624 --> 13:49.878
Coma? For how long?

13:50.004 --> 13:52.881
We're just glad to have you back, son.
That's all that matters.

13:53.007 --> 13:57.427
How long? Dad, how long?

14:02.934 --> 14:07.104
Five years.
Five long years John.

14:09.148 --> 14:14.653
Lost for five years.
Now reborn unto me.

14:16.823 --> 14:20.117
Five... years?

14:22.745 --> 14:23.954
What about Sarah?

14:28.251 --> 14:33.171
Just put her from your thoughts John.
She's turned her back on you.

14:34.424 --> 14:37.551
She cleaves now onto another man,
her husband.

14:41.431 --> 14:42.639
Husband!

16:00.551 --> 16:01.259
Amy!

16:09.143 --> 16:13.355
Amy! Amy!

16:14.107 --> 16:15.774
Amy is my daughter's name.

16:15.900 --> 16:19.319
Your daughter's screaming.
The house is burning.

16:19.695 --> 16:21.655
Your daughter's in the house.

16:21.781 --> 16:27.661
It's not too late. Amy. Amy!

16:41.884 --> 16:46.555
Your daughter's screaming!
Amy's screaming. It's not too late.

16:47.014 --> 16:49.266
Your daughter's screaming. Hurry up!

17:10.788 --> 17:14.457
The first order of business is
getting your body back into shape.

17:15.376 --> 17:18.377
Although you've been
exercised regularly, the, uh--

17:18.503 --> 17:21.589
ligaments have shortened
a little during the coma.

17:21.757 --> 17:23.800
Am I going to have
to live in a wheelchair?

17:23.968 --> 17:28.597
Not permanently. And not for very long.
Not if I can help it.

17:29.932 --> 17:33.518
I, uh--
I won't deceive you John.

17:34.353 --> 17:39.941
Your therapy will be long
and painful. But you will walk.

17:44.280 --> 17:45.447
Thank you.

18:05.676 --> 18:07.135
The wolf is loose.

18:07.637 --> 18:10.263
John, John. Are you alright?

18:16.103 --> 18:17.395
No match for them.

18:27.365 --> 18:28.657
Horses, fire.

19:06.279 --> 19:07.696
The boy is safe.

19:19.333 --> 19:20.583
The boy is safe.

19:20.884 --> 19:24.661
John!
John!

19:24.721 --> 19:27.463
Are you alright? Hmm?

19:29.993 --> 19:32.220
Tell me...
what about the boy?

19:32.930 --> 19:37.183
You keep saying the boy is safe.
The boy is safe. What boy?

19:37.268 --> 19:39.436
You. You're the boy.

19:40.062 --> 19:41.938
I... am the boy?

19:42.606 --> 19:44.941
She saved you. She's alive Sam.

19:45.693 --> 19:46.693
Who?

19:47.361 --> 19:48.653
Your mother.

19:51.115 --> 19:53.366
No, that's not possible, John.

19:53.492 --> 19:54.659
She survived.

19:54.994 --> 19:57.412
John, my mother is dead.

19:57.997 --> 20:02.042
She's alive. I know her name.
I know where she lives.

20:03.210 --> 20:08.590
But that is not possible John.
How could you know that? How?

20:10.426 --> 20:16.264
I'm scared Sam.
What's happening to me?

20:33.824 --> 20:34.908
Hello.

20:35.076 --> 20:37.952
Hello! May I speak to?

20:38.788 --> 20:40.330
Yes.

20:40.498 --> 20:42.290
Is Johanna there please?

20:42.792 --> 20:44.542
One moment.

20:50.383 --> 20:53.385
Hello! Hello, who is it please?

21:03.521 --> 21:10.485
Well, you are either in possession
of a very new human ability...

21:12.279 --> 21:14.239
...or a very old one.

21:14.990 --> 21:18.743
Yes. Oh, over here will be fine.

21:20.162 --> 21:20.870
Thank you.

21:26.419 --> 21:29.712
Try to get you back
on your feet in a day or two.

21:30.172 --> 21:33.049
That should help you get some
of your strength back.

21:40.266 --> 21:41.683
What's on your mind, Sam?

21:45.146 --> 21:48.773
You were right John,
about my mother.

21:51.861 --> 21:54.070
I got the number
from information.

21:54.780 --> 21:58.074
There it was,
right in the phone book.

21:58.200 --> 21:59.659
Did you talk to her?

22:01.954 --> 22:04.873
No, I didn't. I um--

22:06.125 --> 22:10.837
She came to the phone,
but I just couldn't talk to her.

22:12.131 --> 22:13.047
I hung up.

22:14.383 --> 22:15.175
Why?

22:16.635 --> 22:21.931
Why?
Because it wasn't meant to be.

22:23.767 --> 22:25.602
It wasn't meant to be.

22:25.853 --> 22:27.312
Chug, chug, chug!

22:27.438 --> 22:30.565
Come on easy now. Keep it moving.
Keep it moving. Come on.

22:30.733 --> 22:34.569
Weight down, knees up. Keep it
moving. Keep it moving. Chug. Chug.

22:35.571 --> 22:37.197
That's it.

22:37.990 --> 22:44.204
That's it? After all I've done.
That's what I get. Eight lousy steps?

22:44.413 --> 22:45.538
I counted ten.

22:47.208 --> 22:49.751
I'd really like to see you
do some serious chugging.

22:50.377 --> 22:53.421
I'm gonna take a run around
the building. You stay here?

22:53.589 --> 22:54.047
OK.

22:54.215 --> 22:55.590
- Keep chugging?
- OK.

22:55.925 --> 22:57.425
See you when I get back.

23:02.264 --> 23:03.056
Johnny.

23:07.603 --> 23:09.270
They told me you were outside.

23:10.439 --> 23:11.231
I am.

23:12.942 --> 23:15.068
I didn't know
if I should come or not.

23:16.654 --> 23:17.529
It's alright.

23:27.623 --> 23:28.998
You got your hair cut.

23:29.625 --> 23:34.462
Oh, yeah, a long time ago.
You lost weight.

23:36.465 --> 23:39.634
Call it coma diet.
Lose weight while you sleep.

23:43.806 --> 23:45.807
I guess you know I got married.

23:46.141 --> 23:47.433
I heard that.

23:49.728 --> 23:51.271
I think you'd like him.

23:53.107 --> 23:54.023
You still teach?

23:54.316 --> 23:56.901
Mmm. Mmm.
Mothering's a full time job.

23:57.987 --> 24:00.071
Kids too. I didn't know that.

24:00.948 --> 24:04.617
I'm sorry. Thought your father
would have told you.

24:08.330 --> 24:12.250
He's a wonderful little boy.
His name is Denny.

24:13.085 --> 24:14.252
How old is he?

24:14.628 --> 24:15.712
Ten months.

24:24.179 --> 24:25.638
Glad for you.

24:39.695 --> 24:41.446
Please don't look at me like that.

24:42.698 --> 24:46.117
What am I gonna do? For you,
five years have come and gone.

24:46.243 --> 24:52.498
For me, it's just about the next day.
My feelings haven't changed yet.

24:53.250 --> 24:59.339
Oh, Johnny!
Why did it have to happen like this?

25:00.132 --> 25:01.257
Bad luck.

25:07.473 --> 25:09.891
I never should have
let you go that night.

25:10.351 --> 25:14.729
It was my idea, remember?
Jerk!

25:22.821 --> 25:26.658
Everybody's talking about you.
You're the talk of the town.

25:27.618 --> 25:31.871
'Cos I got my head bashed in.
And I'm still here to talk about it?

25:32.915 --> 25:37.168
Because you have the power
of second sight. Is it true Johnny?

25:38.921 --> 25:40.838
The papers won't let up about it.

25:41.340 --> 25:45.760
I keep thinking about a line from a book.
It's "The Legend of Sleepy Hollow".

25:45.844 --> 25:49.681
The last thing I gave my class to read
before the accident.

25:52.017 --> 25:55.728
Ichabod Crane disappears.
The line goes

25:56.271 --> 25:59.941
"As he was a bachelor
and in nobody's debt,

26:00.109 --> 26:02.902
nobody troubled their head
about him, anymore".

26:03.946 --> 26:05.613
Is that what you're afraid of?

26:05.781 --> 26:07.657
That's what I want.

26:44.528 --> 26:44.777
I don't approve.

26:46.864 --> 26:52.326
The press has been hounding me since
I woke up. I wanna get it over with.

26:52.494 --> 26:54.912
Once you set something
like this in motion,

26:55.456 --> 26:58.416
it seems to me
you'll never know where it'll lead.

27:00.627 --> 27:03.546
It's already in motion.
Just wanna stop it.

27:05.174 --> 27:08.676
They went over there and put it out.
And that's all there is.

27:09.678 --> 27:14.766
Clement Dardis WJGE-TV.
What happened to the little girl?

27:15.309 --> 27:16.893
I understand she's fine.

27:18.020 --> 27:22.607
Well... Would you call this
a psychic experience?

27:23.358 --> 27:25.067
No. I would not.

27:25.319 --> 27:27.487
Ever had one of these
experiences before?

27:27.696 --> 27:28.654
No.

27:30.574 --> 27:32.408
How about a demonstration, John?

27:33.202 --> 27:34.160
A what?

27:34.286 --> 27:37.914
A demonstration.
Um, got any predictions?

27:38.332 --> 27:42.210
You think Greg Stillson's
gonna unseat Senator Proctor?

27:43.587 --> 27:44.545
Who?

27:44.838 --> 27:46.047
Greg Stillson.

27:48.801 --> 27:51.469
Er, thank you sir. No more.

27:53.388 --> 27:57.725
Wait a minute. Wait a minute. How
about it John? How about the election?

27:58.268 --> 28:00.770
I don't even know
who you're talking about?

28:00.896 --> 28:04.023
Why, you didn't know
anything about this nurse?

28:04.733 --> 28:05.775
That was different...

28:10.322 --> 28:14.033
Well I...
I touched her hand.

28:16.161 --> 28:18.120
Oh, right! Oh, right!

28:20.916 --> 28:21.958
Touch my hand.

28:23.001 --> 28:27.213
Hey John, touch my hand.
So is my house on fire, John?

28:27.923 --> 28:30.132
Do you want me to stop this?

28:32.094 --> 28:34.846
Tell you about your house.
What do you want to know?

28:34.972 --> 28:36.556
Do you wanna know the future?

28:36.682 --> 28:39.851
Do you wanna know if you're gonna'
die? Is that it? You're gonna die.

28:39.977 --> 28:42.144
I'm gonna die. You wanna know
if you're gonna die tomorrow?

28:42.271 --> 28:48.067
Is that right? You wanna know
why your sister killed herself?

28:48.485 --> 28:51.571
Right, we're done, let go.

28:51.738 --> 28:52.405
It's not alright.

28:52.531 --> 28:53.197
It's OK.

28:53.448 --> 28:54.407
It's not OK.

28:54.867 --> 28:56.576
OK.

28:56.952 --> 28:57.994
I could tell you now.

28:58.120 --> 29:01.163
I'm not gonna talk about that.
Let go of me, you fucking freak.

29:01.290 --> 29:02.957
Stop it. Please stop it.

29:03.083 --> 29:04.166
It's real important.

29:04.459 --> 29:05.918
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

29:09.214 --> 29:10.339
You heard him.

29:19.600 --> 29:24.896
Dr Danvers, call 1522.
Dr Danvers, call 1522.

29:25.188 --> 29:28.900
Oh, yes nurse.
Notify Dr Morton that I'm out here.

29:30.068 --> 29:31.193
She knows you're coming.

29:34.907 --> 29:37.617
- Doctor, thanks for bringing the boy.
- That's alright.

29:54.009 --> 29:55.885
Hello.

29:56.011 --> 29:56.844
It's Johnny, mom.

29:58.722 --> 30:01.474
Oh! Johnny.

30:06.021 --> 30:08.564
Leave your boots
outside the door, dear.

30:08.690 --> 30:11.651
Don't go tracking snow
all over the house.

30:15.530 --> 30:16.364
I won't.

30:17.366 --> 30:18.741
You're a good boy.

31:05.163 --> 31:08.708
You're wasting your time here, sheriff.
You know that. Don't you?

31:10.043 --> 31:15.339
Well, you never know Frank.
Worth a try.

31:25.434 --> 31:26.267
Mr Smith?

31:26.435 --> 31:28.352
Yeah, yeah. I'm Herb Smith.

31:28.478 --> 31:32.148
George Bannerman. How do you do?
Castle Rock. May I come in?

31:32.315 --> 31:34.275
Yeah, yeah. Sure, come in.

31:36.528 --> 31:38.112
It's a little nippy out there.

31:40.949 --> 31:44.452
- That's a nice tree you got there.
- Thanks.

31:44.786 --> 31:47.329
May I do something for you, sheriff?

31:48.582 --> 31:52.752
Well actually, if this is your son,
I came to see him. Are you John?

31:53.628 --> 31:54.587
Sheriff Bannerman.

31:58.592 --> 31:59.467
Castle Rock.

32:01.219 --> 32:05.306
Well, I guess I've come to you
with what you'd call a proposal, John.

32:05.474 --> 32:09.268
It has to do with these murders we've
been having. The Castle Rock killer.

32:09.394 --> 32:12.271
- I'm sure you've heard of him.
- Sure.

32:16.276 --> 32:19.653
I don't know whether
it's true or not, John,

32:20.822 --> 32:23.657
about these
psychic powers of yours.

32:32.834 --> 32:35.711
But if it is true, John.
I could use your help.

32:36.546 --> 32:39.131
John, maybe
you should give him a...

32:41.134 --> 32:45.012
Take a minute to think about it.
But bear in mind,

32:45.138 --> 32:48.557
some decent young women
from homes like this,

32:48.767 --> 32:54.313
met with terrible deaths.
Now, I'm at my wits' end.

32:54.815 --> 32:59.401
I've exhausted about all conventional
methods of approach to this situation.

32:59.986 --> 33:04.490
I've come up with nothing.
I feel you can help me, John.

33:09.788 --> 33:10.996
You made a mistake.

33:12.541 --> 33:13.541
Mmm...

33:18.130 --> 33:22.174
I was sorry to hear about your
mother's death, John. Mr. Smith.

33:22.384 --> 33:25.845
I understand she was
a good woman. Christian woman.

33:27.848 --> 33:33.227
I'm not a religious man myself,
I'm sorry to say. But I will say this.

33:35.147 --> 33:40.151
If God has seen fit to bless you
with this gift, you should use it.

33:42.737 --> 33:48.117
Bless me?
You know what God did for me?

33:48.910 --> 33:51.245
He threw an
eighteen-wheel truck at me.

33:51.371 --> 33:54.165
Bounced me into nowhere
for five years.

33:54.749 --> 33:58.794
When I woke up my girl was gone.
My job was gone.

33:58.920 --> 34:01.839
My legs are just about useless.
Bless me?

34:03.049 --> 34:05.551
God's been a real sport to me.

34:15.103 --> 34:22.067
Alright John. If you change your mind,
you know where I am...

34:27.657 --> 34:29.241
Merry Christmas to you.

34:45.091 --> 34:45.882
Well?

34:48.261 --> 34:49.219
Well what?

34:50.764 --> 34:52.389
See. What did I tell you?

35:07.864 --> 35:11.742
That murder she was talking about.
God-awful things.

35:12.202 --> 35:15.329
Went on all during the time
you were in a coma.

35:17.999 --> 35:20.334
Just don't have the knack for tinsel.

35:21.586 --> 35:24.755
It was your mother who always
kept the tree looking good...

35:29.135 --> 35:33.764
I wish to God she were here now, so
she could talk to you about this thing.

35:34.182 --> 35:37.518
I'm not much help to you, am I?

35:37.686 --> 35:38.769
Sure you are.

35:43.984 --> 35:47.486
You, uh, want to talk about it?

35:48.488 --> 35:50.322
Not that much to say.

35:52.492 --> 35:55.050
It don't bring you much happiness,
does it, son?

35:55.243 --> 35:57.189
When it happens...

35:59.247 --> 36:01.784
when the spells come,

36:01.850 --> 36:05.423
it feels like--
I don't know.

36:05.487 --> 36:09.526
It feels like
I'm dying... inside.

36:20.312 --> 36:23.605
No snow.
It should snow for Christmas.

37:11.196 --> 37:15.032
Hi. I brought you a visitor.

37:15.700 --> 37:17.326
I didn't know you were coming.

37:20.121 --> 37:21.413
I wasn't sure myself.

37:22.791 --> 37:26.919
I'm glad. If I'd known you were
coming, I'd have cleaned up.

37:28.671 --> 37:33.133
You look wonderful.
You lost the crutches I see.

37:34.135 --> 37:37.304
Yeah. I still got the limp.

37:40.225 --> 37:41.433
Is your father home?

37:42.018 --> 37:47.856
No. He won't be back till later.
Is that who I think it is?

37:48.149 --> 37:49.274
His Majesty.

37:50.485 --> 37:51.193
Danny.

37:51.736 --> 37:54.363
Denny. Say Hi.

37:55.198 --> 37:56.115
Denny.

37:59.494 --> 38:01.620
It's cold. Come on in.

38:26.187 --> 38:27.271
He's asleep.

38:35.905 --> 38:40.492
Last time we were alone together,
you said some things

38:40.618 --> 38:48.125
were worth waiting for.
Well, haven't we waited long enough?

39:22.785 --> 39:25.037
Dad's been carrying on
with Charlene McKenzie.

39:25.163 --> 39:27.164
Ever since her husband died,
she's got him over there

39:27.248 --> 39:30.125
building one thing or another.
But if you ask me it's the company

39:30.251 --> 39:32.002
she wants
more than the bookcases.

39:32.086 --> 39:33.086
I heard that.

39:37.425 --> 39:38.759
Hup. Hup.

39:40.929 --> 39:42.137
That's a boy.

39:46.059 --> 39:47.935
There you are young fella'.

39:48.603 --> 39:51.438
I made that for John,
the night he was born.

39:51.648 --> 39:53.023
It's an excellent chair.

39:53.191 --> 39:55.901
So what have you two
been up to all day?

39:57.195 --> 39:59.279
Making bookcases.

40:03.660 --> 40:05.244
Sit down, dinner's ready.

40:17.674 --> 40:19.883
Boy, that smells good. I'm starved.

40:20.510 --> 40:21.969
I hope you like it.

40:22.136 --> 40:25.138
I bet he will. He's fed up
with my cuisine.

40:28.309 --> 40:32.938
For what we are about to receive may
the Lord make us truly grateful. Amen.

40:42.907 --> 40:47.244
You know it feels good to have
a family around this table again.

41:04.345 --> 41:06.430
Am I going to see you again?

41:07.515 --> 41:13.145
Not like today.
Go inside you're freezing.

41:14.689 --> 41:15.939
It, it doesn't have to.

41:16.107 --> 41:18.859
Don't say it. Don't say it Johnny.

41:23.865 --> 41:25.365
I'll just say goodnight.

42:02.445 --> 42:06.239
...Joan of Arc.
But his wife said before today...

42:06.407 --> 42:09.701
Well, guess I'll hit the hay.

42:10.620 --> 42:11.870
I'm gonna watch some TV.

42:12.038 --> 42:14.414
The Castle Rock killer's
in the news again.

42:14.540 --> 42:15.582
Good night, son.

42:15.708 --> 42:18.794
Despite the continuing
efforts on the part of police,

42:18.920 --> 42:22.422
the killer is still at large and is likely
to remain so for some time.

42:22.632 --> 42:24.508
We spoke to Sheriff George
Bannerman outside

42:24.634 --> 42:26.968
the Castle County courthouse
earlier today.

42:28.388 --> 42:33.433
We have no new leads at this time.
However, there is always the hope

42:33.601 --> 42:37.062
that some citizen,
perhaps in the audience right now,

42:37.230 --> 42:40.440
might have some information
that would be very helpful.

42:40.692 --> 42:42.067
My line is always open.

42:42.235 --> 42:45.862
And I would welcome any help
we can possibly get.

42:46.030 --> 42:48.782
That's really all I have to say
at this time. Thank you.

42:48.908 --> 42:50.659
Thus far, nine separate murders

42:50.785 --> 42:52.869
have been attributed
to the Castle Rock killer,

42:52.995 --> 42:55.539
dating back almost
three and a half years.

42:55.665 --> 42:59.126
The most recent victim of this
shocking wave of rape murders

42:59.293 --> 43:01.461
was 15 year old Debbie Lindeman.

43:01.629 --> 43:04.131
A sophomore
at Castle Rock high school.

43:04.257 --> 43:07.634
Her partially clad body was
found just one month ago today

43:07.760 --> 43:11.138
in the rock lane boat yard.
As in the other Castle Rock killings,

43:11.305 --> 43:13.765
cause of death was determined
by the coroner's office

43:13.933 --> 43:18.645
to be multiple stab wounds.
Next on News Eight,

43:18.813 --> 43:22.774
sports and weather with Ron.
After this important message.

43:26.487 --> 43:27.738
I'm gonna help him.

43:29.323 --> 43:30.949
What did you say, son?

43:31.998 --> 43:35.000
The sheriff that came here...

43:35.501 --> 43:37.447
Bannerman.

43:41.006 --> 43:43.000
I'm going to help him.

43:44.797 --> 43:47.674
We think the killer hid
around the corner,

43:47.842 --> 43:50.635
just out the end of the tunnel there.

43:51.095 --> 43:55.140
And when the poor girl came through,
the bastard was waiting for her.

43:55.391 --> 43:58.351
Tell the kids
not to come through here. Dammit.

43:58.644 --> 44:02.189
You know they like to use this
as a short cut to school.

44:07.528 --> 44:08.779
He stood right here.

44:10.490 --> 44:15.494
Found a lot of cigarette butts, same
brand. Eight or nine butts here.

44:16.245 --> 44:17.496
This help you any?

44:17.705 --> 44:23.335
I don't know. Have you got something
he might have touched or worn?

44:24.712 --> 44:26.755
Frank, give me that package.

44:31.594 --> 44:34.387
It's the only real evidence we have.

44:35.014 --> 44:37.557
Found it in one
of the bushes back there.

44:37.725 --> 44:43.438
Same brand as the butts
we found in the ground. Here.

45:34.156 --> 45:35.407
Nothing.

45:40.580 --> 45:42.914
I thought I might
have felt something. But I...

45:43.040 --> 45:45.625
It's OK. It's OK.
Can't say we didn't try. Huh?

45:46.294 --> 45:48.211
Dispatch to Sheriff Bannerman.

45:49.297 --> 45:51.840
Yeah, this is Bannerman.

45:52.675 --> 45:54.968
We got another body here, sheriff.

45:56.345 --> 45:59.431
Oh. Dammit!

46:01.058 --> 46:02.809
What's the word George?

46:02.977 --> 46:05.103
What's the word on the stabbings.
Sheriff?

46:05.271 --> 46:08.273
What's the word on
the Castle Rock Killer?

46:08.566 --> 46:10.650
That's that psychic Smith,
isn't it?

46:10.818 --> 46:16.281
Stand back please. Give us a break.
We're trying to do a job.

46:28.836 --> 46:31.880
Anyone know who she is? Dodd?

46:48.481 --> 46:51.358
Yeah I know this girl.
Her name is Alma Frechette.

46:51.525 --> 46:54.986
She works at the Coffee Pot cafÃ©
across the way there.

46:56.364 --> 46:59.240
Your idea George
to have a psychic with qualifications?

46:59.367 --> 47:00.909
Dodd, get these people out of here.

47:01.035 --> 47:04.746
Move 'em back. Move the
people back. Knock it off -

47:04.872 --> 47:08.124
those cameras now.
No more cameras. No more.

47:08.918 --> 47:10.794
- Dodd!
- Yeah.

47:12.380 --> 47:14.756
- Nobody comes up here.
- You got it, sheriff.

47:25.351 --> 47:26.559
You wanna try?

48:09.103 --> 48:11.104
Hey Alma. Hi.

48:11.230 --> 48:14.149
Hi. What are you doing up there?

48:14.692 --> 48:17.110
Waiting for you.
How about a little smile?

48:17.611 --> 48:18.611
She knows him.

48:28.247 --> 48:29.581
She knows him.

48:40.760 --> 48:43.386
Why should
I waste a smile on you?

48:43.679 --> 48:46.306
You want to see something.
It's the God damndest thing.

48:46.474 --> 48:47.265
What?

48:47.433 --> 48:49.309
Come up here to the gazebo.

48:57.026 --> 49:04.741
She knows him. Not scared.
She knows him.

49:09.121 --> 49:10.163
Alright.

49:21.383 --> 49:23.968
Well, what did you want to show me?

49:25.721 --> 49:33.645
Gazebo! You like that word, Alma?
Come here, look at this.

49:35.356 --> 49:40.110
Jesus. Will you let go of me?
Is this your idea of a joke?

49:40.361 --> 49:41.111
No joke!

49:58.462 --> 49:59.379
Wait!

50:01.757 --> 50:04.843
You alright? Dodd give me a hand.

50:05.553 --> 50:10.557
I saw him. I was there. I saw him.
I stood there. I saw his face.

50:10.724 --> 50:11.641
Who?

50:11.725 --> 50:15.228
I stood there and
watched him kill that girl. Dodd!

50:15.771 --> 50:17.021
Wait a minute.
What are you saying?

50:17.148 --> 50:21.568
I did nothing. I stood there
and watched him kill that girl.

50:21.694 --> 50:23.361
Who are you talking about?

50:23.946 --> 50:29.617
Dodd.
I stood there, I did nothing.

50:32.246 --> 50:36.583
Dodd! Dodd get up here.

50:38.669 --> 50:41.379
He just took off in your car sheriff.

50:45.384 --> 50:48.720
I saw his face. I saw his face.

51:06.447 --> 51:08.323
I want you to stay there.

51:32.765 --> 51:33.765
Sheriff.

51:35.643 --> 51:38.019
I thought
I told you to stay by the car.

51:39.230 --> 51:40.146
Who's there?

51:41.398 --> 51:44.234
It's Sheriff Bannerman.
Wanna talk to your son, Mrs Dodd.

51:45.486 --> 51:46.402
He isn't here.

51:47.446 --> 51:49.322
Well, his patrol car's out here.

51:49.531 --> 51:51.866
Well his car's here. But he isn't.

51:52.409 --> 51:55.203
He's here. I saw him in the window.

52:02.878 --> 52:04.712
I'm tellin you he isn't home.

52:04.922 --> 52:06.631
- I'm coming in, Mrs Dodd.
- No!

52:17.851 --> 52:19.727
You leave my boy alone.

52:26.700 --> 52:27.837
You knew.

52:28.901 --> 52:30.642
Didn't you?

52:31.971 --> 52:33.500
You knew.

52:33.973 --> 52:36.579
You...

52:39.278 --> 52:41.519
You're a devil...

52:41.580 --> 52:43.526
sent from hell!

54:34.238 --> 54:35.405
Frank.

56:45.452 --> 56:46.577
Hello, John.

56:49.748 --> 56:50.873
May I come in?

57:09.601 --> 57:12.019
How did you find me? My father?

57:13.438 --> 57:17.858
Stopped off to see him. And he
told me you moved to a new town.

57:18.819 --> 57:21.737
He's worried about you. And so am I.

57:23.115 --> 57:27.410
There's nothing to worry about. I'm
taking care of myself. It's about time.

57:28.161 --> 57:31.622
I'm still your doctor John.
You're still under my care.

57:32.082 --> 57:35.084
We have to stay in touch.

57:38.338 --> 57:41.757
How's the, uh--
All healed up?

57:44.386 --> 57:48.973
The bullet went right through me.
It's nothing.

57:50.142 --> 57:55.229
Good. Nice place you have here.

58:01.028 --> 58:01.944
It's home.

58:09.119 --> 58:11.495
Those headaches are getting worse.
Aren't they?

58:12.122 --> 58:14.540
Three or four times a day sometimes.

58:17.127 --> 58:19.128
I brought you some new medication.

58:19.546 --> 58:21.047
No. No more pills.

58:21.590 --> 58:25.926
Takes time to recover. The healing
process is slow. I told you many times.

58:26.970 --> 58:32.808
I'm not getting better.
I'm getting worse. Isn't that right?

58:41.800 --> 58:43.019
Alright.

58:46.612 --> 58:50.526
Now listen. In the last few
months I've done some research

58:50.550 --> 58:53.412
into the area
of psychic phenomena.

58:53.914 --> 58:57.792
Several cases such as yours
have been documented -

58:57.918 --> 58:59.960
I was surprised to discover.

59:00.253 --> 59:03.172
And the pattern is always the same.

59:04.216 --> 59:09.053
As the spells, the visions grow stronger
and more powerful,

59:09.262 --> 59:11.263
so the body weakens.

59:13.809 --> 59:16.519
But I don't need any research
or documentation

59:16.645 --> 59:21.273
to see that this thing is sucking
the life out of you.

59:21.441 --> 59:24.151
One look at you can tell me that.

59:24.361 --> 59:28.906
You mean I'm gonna die? How long?

59:30.617 --> 59:34.870
I think we can arrest the process.
Reverse it even.

59:35.580 --> 59:36.580
How do you do that?

59:36.707 --> 59:37.748
Come back with me.

59:37.874 --> 59:38.791
Where?

59:38.959 --> 59:40.042
To the clinic of course.

59:40.502 --> 59:42.878
No. Absolutely no.

59:43.130 --> 59:44.755
John please! You must.

59:45.507 --> 59:47.258
Why? So you can study me.

59:47.426 --> 59:54.932
No. So I can protect you. You need to
be in a controlled environment, John.

59:56.977 --> 01:00:01.272
I wanna show you something.
Come with me.

01:00:04.985 --> 01:00:07.486
The cards and letters
just keep pouring in.

01:00:09.656 --> 01:00:10.906
What is all this?

01:00:11.491 --> 01:00:14.660
It's people. Lost dogs,
lost children, lost lives.

01:00:16.329 --> 01:00:17.830
You haven't opened them.

01:00:18.165 --> 01:00:23.127
I don't have to. They all want the same
thing. Reassurance. Help. Love.

01:00:23.837 --> 01:00:29.467
Things I can't give them. My father
sends this stuff onto me. I let it pile up.

01:00:29.676 --> 01:00:32.052
Why? Why do you keep it?

01:00:32.471 --> 01:00:36.098
This is why
I can't go on. Live my life.

01:00:37.267 --> 01:00:40.478
Why I have to stay
locked up here in the house.

01:00:40.687 --> 01:00:43.647
I'm already living in a controlled
environment, Sam.

01:00:46.064 --> 01:00:48.510
Nothing can touch me here.

01:00:50.402 --> 01:00:52.439
I'm alone.

01:00:53.805 --> 01:00:55.716
I'm safe.

01:00:57.509 --> 01:01:01.013
"But instead of dying,

01:01:01.079 --> 01:01:06.028
she shall only fall into...

01:01:06.084 --> 01:01:08.530
a profound sleep

01:01:08.587 --> 01:01:12.968
which shall last a hundred years."

01:01:16.306 --> 01:01:17.348
That's my mom.

01:01:20.393 --> 01:01:21.352
OK.

01:01:24.105 --> 01:01:25.231
- Bye.
- Bye.

01:01:25.398 --> 01:01:26.649
John Smith?

01:01:31.029 --> 01:01:35.950
Hi. I'm Roger Stuart.
I'd like to talk to you for a moment.

01:01:45.627 --> 01:01:46.585
Sit down.

01:01:53.969 --> 01:01:55.168
What can I do for you?

01:01:55.233 --> 01:01:58.500
Um... it's, uh--

01:01:59.237 --> 01:02:02.184
it's my boy,
my son, Chris.

01:02:02.240 --> 01:02:05.000
He needs help.

01:02:05.355 --> 01:02:09.483
I've enquired around.
You come highly recommended.

01:02:11.903 --> 01:02:13.487
What's the matter with him?

01:02:14.573 --> 01:02:20.786
I wish I knew. He's bright, I know he is.
But he won't take part in school.

01:02:20.912 --> 01:02:26.292
He won't join in. He won't learn.
And, God, he's so shy.

01:02:30.213 --> 01:02:32.590
You think you could help him?

01:02:33.466 --> 01:02:36.051
I wouldn't know that unless I met him.

01:02:36.386 --> 01:02:40.306
Well he's not in the car. He wouldn't
come with me today.

01:02:40.473 --> 01:02:42.433
You have
to come out to the house.

01:02:43.018 --> 01:02:48.480
No that's out of the question.
It's just not the way I do it.

01:02:49.983 --> 01:02:51.233
It won't work otherwise.

01:02:52.569 --> 01:02:57.281
Please, if you come out to the house
he'll get to know you.

01:02:57.365 --> 01:03:01.827
Then you can bring him back here
for the lessons. Please.

01:03:04.497 --> 01:03:05.664
OK.

01:03:06.291 --> 01:03:10.419
Great. Tomorrow morning's Saturday.
I'll send a car over to pick you up.

01:03:13.882 --> 01:03:15.007
Thank you.

01:04:11.523 --> 01:04:15.567
That reminds me of my first campaign,
when I ran for a seat in the Senate.

01:04:15.694 --> 01:04:18.529
Upstate in my hometown,
my opponent went down to the ghetto,

01:04:18.613 --> 01:04:22.366
he was handing out dollar bills to them
black people, trying to buy votes.

01:04:22.534 --> 01:04:26.537
I went down there. I said

01:04:26.663 --> 01:04:29.456
Then go back and get some more
'cos times is rough.

01:04:29.582 --> 01:04:31.500
But once
in the voting booth, I want you

01:04:31.584 --> 01:04:33.752
to vote for whomever
you damn well please."

01:04:33.920 --> 01:04:36.130
Well, we won that election by-
what Sonny?

01:04:36.256 --> 01:04:36.839
Twenty-nine.

01:04:37.007 --> 01:04:39.383
Twenty-nine percentage point.
We've been winning ever since.

01:04:39.509 --> 01:04:42.136
And those people spent that money
with a clear conscience.

01:04:44.973 --> 01:04:47.933
Hi John! Good morning.
Nice to see you.

01:04:48.309 --> 01:04:50.769
Gentlemen, I'd like you to meet
my son's tutor. John Smith.

01:04:50.895 --> 01:04:53.814
- John this is Greg Stillson.
- How are you John?

01:04:54.107 --> 01:04:56.233
Of course,
this gentlemen is Averill Grant?

01:04:56.401 --> 01:04:57.234
Elliman. Sonny Elliman.

01:04:57.360 --> 01:05:00.738
Sonny Elliman, right here.
Well Greg, you got some good ideas.

01:05:00.822 --> 01:05:02.614
You gotta let me think about 'em.

01:05:04.409 --> 01:05:06.827
Listen Roger, we've got a good
thing going and it's going strong.

01:05:06.953 --> 01:05:10.581
And I want you to be a part of it. I need
your support. I need your expertise.

01:05:10.707 --> 01:05:14.918
I need your input. And most
importantly I need your money.

01:05:16.463 --> 01:05:17.421
God bless Roger.

01:05:17.589 --> 01:05:18.422
I'll be seeing you.

01:05:18.548 --> 01:05:19.757
Thanks for dropping by Greg.

01:05:19.883 --> 01:05:22.092
- I'll see you. Bye, bye.
- I'll see you Sonny.

01:05:22.218 --> 01:05:23.969
My God, what a glorious day.

01:05:26.097 --> 01:05:26.847
Amen.

01:05:32.645 --> 01:05:36.607
Sorry about that.
Well, let's go and see Chris.

01:05:36.816 --> 01:05:37.608
Sure.

01:05:40.653 --> 01:05:45.532
Chris, this is Johnny. Remember
I told you he was coming this morning.

01:05:49.287 --> 01:05:51.872
I'll leave you two alone
to get acquainted.

01:06:20.485 --> 01:06:22.402
Your father says there's
something wrong with you.

01:06:22.529 --> 01:06:27.241
He wants me to bring you out of your
shell; I don't know what to do.

01:06:29.369 --> 01:06:35.332
You don't have to do anything. It's my
dad that lives in a shell. Not me.

01:07:18.751 --> 01:07:21.753
Chris has really taken
to you John. I'm impressed.

01:07:21.838 --> 01:07:23.881
Made a lot of progress for one day.

01:07:24.007 --> 01:07:25.215
Just had a talk.

01:07:25.592 --> 01:07:29.720
Well, with Chris that's a real
achievement. You want a drink?

01:07:30.597 --> 01:07:31.138
No.

01:07:31.306 --> 01:07:32.347
Don't want a beer?

01:07:32.807 --> 01:07:33.515
OK.

01:07:34.309 --> 01:07:35.642
Brian, get him a beer.

01:07:46.654 --> 01:07:48.155
Here let's listen to this.

01:07:49.157 --> 01:07:51.617
Ninety-nine.
One hundred.

01:07:55.538 --> 01:07:59.208
How are ya' doin'? I'm Greg Stillson.
Just thought I'd drop by here on my way

01:07:59.292 --> 01:08:00.292
to the US Senate.

01:08:00.793 --> 01:08:03.420
Greg Stillson. You remember
you met him in the hall this morning.

01:08:03.588 --> 01:08:05.589
Thanks for coming out all of you.

01:08:05.673 --> 01:08:08.300
Boy you gotta be in good shape
to go the full distance

01:08:08.426 --> 01:08:10.385
for those big boys
down in Washington.

01:08:10.470 --> 01:08:12.471
You gotta stay in shape
all the time for those boys.

01:08:12.597 --> 01:08:14.765
You can't turn your back on 'em.

01:08:14.891 --> 01:08:16.600
Just stay in better shape
than this country.

01:08:16.725 --> 01:08:17.935
What the hell is happening
to this country?

01:08:18.144 --> 01:08:20.479
Can anybody tell me
what the hell is going on?

01:08:21.147 --> 01:08:23.607
I read in one of your local papers...

01:08:23.774 --> 01:08:28.028
Can you believe this guy?
He's just getting warmed up.

01:08:29.572 --> 01:08:31.573
Are you going
to vote for him, John?

01:08:31.741 --> 01:08:34.826
I'm not even registered.

01:08:35.036 --> 01:08:37.621
- You're not registered?
- No.

01:08:38.206 --> 01:08:42.792
Well, get registered, pal, and vote
against this turkey. He's dangerous.

01:08:43.877 --> 01:08:46.046
And I see all around me
so many unemployed.

01:08:46.171 --> 01:08:48.006
What are you people doing here
in the middle of the day?

01:08:48.174 --> 01:08:52.094
You're standing out in the cold.
Look at each other.

01:08:52.220 --> 01:08:56.223
How do you feel about each other?
Are you proud of your communities?

01:08:56.349 --> 01:08:59.100
Would you send the guy
next to you to the US Senate? Uh?

01:08:59.310 --> 01:09:01.979
A real man of the people.

01:09:02.522 --> 01:09:04.856
Jesus, what an act.

01:09:05.899 --> 01:09:07.859
Can't they see through this guy?

01:09:08.027 --> 01:09:11.154
I'm mixed up. You both acted like
you were friends this morning.

01:09:12.865 --> 01:09:16.993
Guys like Stillson, you gotta walk the
thin line. You can't get too close,

01:09:17.078 --> 01:09:19.537
'cos if they lose,
they'll drag you down with them.

01:09:19.706 --> 01:09:24.292
On the other hand if he wins
- and this turkey just might -

01:09:24.419 --> 01:09:27.254
you gotta make sure
he thought he was a good friend.

01:09:27.380 --> 01:09:29.339
Know what I mean John?

01:09:29.549 --> 01:09:31.383
They're not working there's
unemployment everywhere.

01:09:31.509 --> 01:09:34.636
I've come down here today
with a job for every one of you.

01:09:34.761 --> 01:09:37.555
I've come here today
with a challenge for all of you.

01:09:37.724 --> 01:09:40.850
I'm challenging you right
here and now to join me.

01:09:40.977 --> 01:09:45.604
Join a growing army of volunteer
workers on my campaign.

01:09:45.857 --> 01:09:51.278
Let's send Greg Stillson to the US
Senate and mediocrity to hell.

01:10:19.265 --> 01:10:21.016
What can I do for you boys?

01:10:22.393 --> 01:10:25.062
You work late, Mr Brenner.
That's very admirable.

01:10:26.564 --> 01:10:27.814
I'm Greg Stillson.

01:10:29.484 --> 01:10:31.818
I know who you are, Mr Stillson.

01:10:33.279 --> 01:10:35.989
Now take your paid gorilla
and get out of my office.

01:10:38.451 --> 01:10:40.452
My friend Sonny doesn't
want to see anybody hurt.

01:10:40.620 --> 01:10:42.287
But we got a little problem here.

01:10:42.955 --> 01:10:44.539
Get to the point Mr Stillson.

01:10:45.249 --> 01:10:48.210
You know I'm damn well even
in the polls. See, I'm catchin' on.

01:10:48.336 --> 01:10:49.961
The people gotta a need for me.

01:10:50.129 --> 01:10:53.090
I'm gonna win big
and I'll tell you something else.

01:10:53.257 --> 01:10:55.759
I've had a vision
that I'm gonna be

01:10:55.885 --> 01:10:58.762
President of the United States,
someday.

01:10:58.888 --> 01:11:03.016
And I have accepted that responsibility.
And nobody, I mean nobody,

01:11:03.184 --> 01:11:05.852
is gonna stop me.

01:11:09.607 --> 01:11:13.985
Now, you can just imagine how I felt
when one of my loyal staff people

01:11:14.153 --> 01:11:17.531
brought me your editorial that's
gonna hit the streets tomorrow.

01:11:18.324 --> 01:11:21.868
You don't seem to like me,
Brenner. But that's OK.

01:11:22.036 --> 01:11:24.121
Because I don't like you either.

01:11:25.415 --> 01:11:26.832
How did you get that?

01:11:27.166 --> 01:11:31.128
Well, like you, Brenner,
I'm not at liberty to reveal my sources.

01:11:33.005 --> 01:11:35.090
Well, it doesn't make any difference.

01:11:35.341 --> 01:11:36.383
Because you're right,

01:11:36.509 --> 01:11:39.261
that editorial is gonna'
hit the streets tomorrow morning.

01:11:39.512 --> 01:11:41.138
Not if we can make a deal.

01:11:41.848 --> 01:11:43.640
What the hell
are your talking about?

01:11:44.267 --> 01:11:48.395
I'm talkin' about you stayin' out
of the campaign business

01:11:48.563 --> 01:11:51.231
and me stayin' out
of the publishing business.

01:11:51.524 --> 01:11:53.775
Show him what we've got
to publish, Sonny.

01:12:00.783 --> 01:12:02.200
That's your best shot.

01:12:04.036 --> 01:12:07.247
I've got lots of loyal people
on my side, Brenner.

01:12:07.373 --> 01:12:11.168
That young lady in the photographs
with you is one of them.

01:12:11.335 --> 01:12:16.006
Now I've never met Mrs Brenner,
but I'm damn near sure that ain't her.

01:12:16.257 --> 01:12:17.674
What do think, Sonny?

01:12:26.309 --> 01:12:27.517
Is this Mrs Brenner?

01:12:35.568 --> 01:12:36.735
It doesn't look like her.

01:12:36.861 --> 01:12:39.029
You son of a bitch.
You set me up.

01:12:39.113 --> 01:12:40.363
Who are you calling
a son of a bitch?

01:12:40.490 --> 01:12:45.535
No, it's alright, Sonny. Let's give
Mr Brenner a chance to think about

01:12:45.661 --> 01:12:49.122
his wife and kids.
And his position in the community.

01:13:00.593 --> 01:13:03.136
What if I don't make a deal, Stillson?

01:13:03.387 --> 01:13:06.890
Oh, you'll make a deal.
Otherwise I'll have my friend Sonny

01:13:06.974 --> 01:13:08.975
take your godamn head off.

01:13:12.438 --> 01:13:13.313
Good idea.

01:13:17.360 --> 01:13:19.569
You see Sonny, I told you
he was a reasonable man.

01:13:19.737 --> 01:13:23.240
Yeah. He's a nice man. I like him.
I like the wife too.

01:13:30.206 --> 01:13:34.751
"Prophet!" said I, "thing of evil"
prophet still, if bird or devil!

01:13:34.877 --> 01:13:37.337
By that Heaven
that bends above us

01:13:37.463 --> 01:13:39.756
by that God we both adore

01:13:39.882 --> 01:13:44.594
Tell this soul with sorrow laden
if, within the distant Aidenn,

01:13:44.720 --> 01:13:49.057
It shall clasp a sainted maiden
whom the angels named Lenore."

01:13:49.225 --> 01:13:54.271
Chris, skip to the part where he talks
about "will I ever see her again".

01:13:57.024 --> 01:14:01.319
"Eagerly I wished the morrow
Vainly I had sought to borrow

01:14:01.445 --> 01:14:05.240
from my books surcease of sorrow.
Sorrow for the lost Lenore.

01:14:05.366 --> 01:14:07.242
For the rare and radiant maiden

01:14:07.410 --> 01:14:12.038
Whom the angels name Lenore
Nameless here for evermore".

01:14:14.959 --> 01:14:16.585
Stop, I'll be right back.

01:14:27.179 --> 01:14:29.139
Good afternoon, sir. We're out
in your neighbourhood today,

01:14:29.265 --> 01:14:30.807
talking about Greg Stillson.

01:14:31.183 --> 01:14:33.226
You're familiar with our candidate,
aren't you?

01:14:33.352 --> 01:14:34.477
What do you think?

01:14:38.149 --> 01:14:42.402
Yeah, right. But are you aware
of what Greg Stillson stands for?

01:14:44.905 --> 01:14:47.365
Greg Stillson's mounting the most
successful third party movement

01:14:47.491 --> 01:14:48.992
this state has ever seen.

01:14:49.160 --> 01:14:53.038
Stillson represents both the poor
and the well-off, the young and the old.

01:14:53.164 --> 01:14:55.874
Could you come back?
I have a student.

01:14:56.125 --> 01:14:58.668
Oh, sure. I know you're busy. Can I
leave you some literature, though?

01:14:58.794 --> 01:14:59.502
Sure.

01:14:59.629 --> 01:15:02.047
Honey! Could you bring
some of those brochures?

01:15:19.649 --> 01:15:20.857
Hello, Johnny.

01:15:26.030 --> 01:15:26.863
Hi.

01:15:29.575 --> 01:15:31.493
Is this where you're living now?

01:15:31.577 --> 01:15:34.204
Yeah. I'm...
I'm back to teaching.

01:15:35.331 --> 01:15:37.082
This is my husband, Walt.

01:15:38.334 --> 01:15:43.254
Nice to meet you finally, John. I've
heard Sarah talk about you so often.

01:15:47.218 --> 01:15:50.637
Hey. Come back, Johnny.
It's no fun reading by myself.

01:15:51.263 --> 01:15:53.723
Chris. Walt and Sarah.

01:15:55.184 --> 01:15:55.892
Hi.

01:15:57.603 --> 01:16:00.438
We'll let you get back to work. We've
got a lot of ground to cover ourselves.

01:16:00.523 --> 01:16:01.398
Don't we honey?

01:16:04.110 --> 01:16:05.402
Nice to meet you.

01:16:05.653 --> 01:16:06.111
Bye.

01:16:06.237 --> 01:16:08.738
Don't forget who to vote for
on Election Day.

01:16:16.038 --> 01:16:17.205
Bye.

01:16:25.798 --> 01:16:27.298
Who was that?

01:16:32.471 --> 01:16:34.806
Hey. You OK?

01:16:40.771 --> 01:16:46.860
Why are you crying, Johnny?
Johnny!

01:17:26.025 --> 01:17:27.525
What's the matter?

01:17:28.486 --> 01:17:29.903
Nothing.

01:17:30.988 --> 01:17:32.197
My ride's here.

01:17:32.656 --> 01:17:34.157
I'm going with you.

01:17:44.001 --> 01:17:45.168
I gotta talk to you.

01:17:45.336 --> 01:17:46.294
Hi, Johnny.

01:17:47.713 --> 01:17:49.214
What is this? What are you doing?

01:17:49.381 --> 01:17:52.175
Pretty good stuff, huh?
I organised a hockey team for Chris

01:17:52.301 --> 01:17:53.343
and some of his friends.

01:17:53.511 --> 01:17:56.137
We have our
first practice this afternoon.

01:17:56.263 --> 01:17:57.764
You are looking at the coach.

01:17:57.890 --> 01:17:58.598
Call it off.

01:17:58.766 --> 01:18:00.183
Take that stuff in the garage, OK?

01:18:00.351 --> 01:18:01.768
There's going to be an accident.
Call it off.

01:18:01.936 --> 01:18:06.272
Call it off? What for? Chris has been
looking forward to this all week, huh?

01:18:07.733 --> 01:18:09.692
He's really coming out of his shell,
John.

01:18:09.777 --> 01:18:12.237
Wait. I gotta talk to you.

01:18:15.616 --> 01:18:18.284
We'll have a little nourishment
and then we'll hit the ice.

01:18:18.410 --> 01:18:21.913
No. Listen to me. There's gonna'
be an accident. Call it off.

01:18:22.081 --> 01:18:24.415
Don't be ridiculous. We always skate
on that pond until March.

01:18:24.542 --> 01:18:26.251
What the hell is the matter with you?

01:18:26.418 --> 01:18:28.002
You wanna kill your own son?

01:18:28.254 --> 01:18:29.587
I'm scared, dad.

01:18:30.256 --> 01:18:34.217
For Christ's sake, John. Don't be
scared. Just go and eat your cookies.

01:18:34.593 --> 01:18:36.594
Don't you know who I am?

01:18:38.097 --> 01:18:41.349
Course I know who you are. You think
I'd have you come into my son's life,

01:18:41.433 --> 01:18:44.519
without checking you out. But I hired
you for your abilities as a teacher.

01:18:44.603 --> 01:18:48.022
Not a fortune teller.
Don't give me any argument.

01:18:50.568 --> 01:18:52.861
The ice is gonna break.

01:18:54.905 --> 01:18:59.284
I want you outta here. I don't want you
in my boy's life, anymore.

01:18:59.451 --> 01:19:02.078
And I don't want any argument
from you. I want you to do exactly

01:19:02.288 --> 01:19:03.621
what I'm telling you now.

01:19:04.081 --> 01:19:08.918
No Dad.
You don't know. It's not safe.

01:19:10.754 --> 01:19:13.798
Alright to hell with it. To hell
with the whole thing. Forget it all.

01:19:13.966 --> 01:19:17.594
Forget the hockey team, forget the
practice. But I want you outta here.

01:19:18.178 --> 01:19:20.930
Whatever you say.
I'm sorry about the...

01:19:21.307 --> 01:19:23.933
I'll see
that you'll get your final cheque.

01:19:24.560 --> 01:19:30.940
I'm not crazy, you know. Don't let the
boy think I am. I'm right about this.

01:19:32.985 --> 01:19:35.194
But we'll never know, will we?

01:19:38.449 --> 01:19:39.824
Give me your hand.

01:19:50.586 --> 01:19:52.295
Nothing to worry about now.

01:19:52.504 --> 01:19:54.881
My driver will take you home.

01:19:57.343 --> 01:19:58.384
You were right.

01:20:16.445 --> 01:20:22.992
Chris! Hey, what's going on?
You're not even dressed.

01:20:28.123 --> 01:20:31.876
You called it off.
I thought you called it off.

01:20:32.044 --> 01:20:37.090
Why, that was just to get rid of him.
So! Are we going, or not?

01:20:39.635 --> 01:20:42.345
Are you going to sit here and
pout like a baby in your room?

01:20:42.513 --> 01:20:45.598
Or are you coming outside
to play hockey with your friends?

01:20:50.980 --> 01:20:51.938
Right.

01:22:00.924 --> 01:22:07.055
Hello. Who is it? Johnny!

01:23:19.837 --> 01:23:21.254
Sarah.
See you down there, honey.

01:23:21.380 --> 01:23:22.213
OK.

01:25:46.525 --> 01:25:47.650
Do it, Jim.

01:25:48.360 --> 01:25:49.986
For God's sake. I won't.

01:25:50.070 --> 01:25:52.905
Do it! Put your hand
on the scanning screen

01:25:53.031 --> 01:25:55.157
and you'll go down in history with me.

01:25:55.242 --> 01:25:58.369
As what? The world's
greatest mass murderers.

01:25:58.704 --> 01:26:01.831
You cowardly bastard.
You're not the voice of the people.

01:26:01.915 --> 01:26:03.499
I am the voice of the people.

01:26:03.625 --> 01:26:07.586
The people speak through me not you.
It came to me while I slept, Sonny.

01:26:07.713 --> 01:26:11.257
My destiny. In the middle of the night,
it came to me. I must get up now.

01:26:11.383 --> 01:26:15.511
Right now. And fulfil my destiny.
Now you put your goddamn hand

01:26:15.637 --> 01:26:20.558
on that scanning screen, or I'll hack
it off and put it on for you. Do it!

01:26:33.530 --> 01:26:34.822
May God forgive me.

01:26:46.001 --> 01:26:47.251
Congratulations, General.

01:26:50.088 --> 01:26:52.048
Complete the sequence,
Mr President.

01:27:12.277 --> 01:27:12.985
My destiny.

01:27:21.912 --> 01:27:22.953
Thank you Sonny.

01:27:32.297 --> 01:27:33.506
Let them come up.

01:27:36.301 --> 01:27:39.261
This is not necessary, Mr President.
We have a diplomatic solution.

01:27:39.346 --> 01:27:45.101
Mr Vice President. Mr Secretary.
The missiles are flying. Hallelujah!

01:27:46.353 --> 01:27:47.395
Hallelujah!

01:28:18.718 --> 01:28:24.765
If you could go back in time. Germany,
say before Hitler came to power.

01:28:25.308 --> 01:28:29.979
Knowing what you know now. What
would you do? Would you kill him?

01:28:31.815 --> 01:28:36.610
Is that why you sent for me, John?
To ask me this question.

01:28:41.658 --> 01:28:47.329
I have to talk to you, Sam.
Because I've had another episode.

01:28:48.915 --> 01:28:51.667
Ah, yes. Go on.

01:28:53.503 --> 01:28:54.920
I've been tutoring this boy.

01:28:55.046 --> 01:28:58.757
His name is Stuart
and in the vision, I saw him drown.

01:28:58.884 --> 01:29:01.886
I saw him die, Sam.
But that's not the point.

01:29:03.054 --> 01:29:06.015
In the vision, there was something
missing. Something I couldn't see.

01:29:07.350 --> 01:29:08.601
How do you mean?

01:29:08.894 --> 01:29:13.814
I don't know. It was like
a blank spot... A dead zone.

01:29:20.197 --> 01:29:26.035
Er, first of all tell me. Did the boy in fact
drown? You say you saw him drown.

01:29:26.203 --> 01:29:29.705
No, no. His father wanted to take him to
play hockey. I talked him out of it.

01:29:29.873 --> 01:29:31.165
The boy's alive.

01:29:31.583 --> 01:29:39.507
Ah. Yes, don't you see?
Don't you see how clear it all is?

01:29:40.592 --> 01:29:43.260
Not only can you see the future...

01:29:43.470 --> 01:29:45.763
- You can...
- I can change it.

01:29:46.056 --> 01:29:50.684
You can change it.
Exactly. Ha, here.

01:29:53.980 --> 01:29:57.441
Yes John, that is your dead zone.

01:29:58.235 --> 01:30:04.073
The possibility of altering
the outcome of your premonitions.

01:30:05.659 --> 01:30:07.826
It's fascinating.
Let me make a note.

01:30:10.330 --> 01:30:12.081
What about my question, Sam?

01:30:12.415 --> 01:30:17.419
Huh? Oh, you mean
the one about Hitler.

01:30:19.130 --> 01:30:20.464
What would you do?

01:30:21.216 --> 01:30:25.010
I don't like the sound of this, John.
What are your getting at?

01:30:25.262 --> 01:30:28.138
What would you do?
Would you kill him?

01:30:32.018 --> 01:30:35.729
Alright. Alright.
I'll give you an answer.

01:30:37.566 --> 01:30:39.942
I'm a man of medicine.

01:30:40.485 --> 01:30:43.696
I'm expected to save lives
and ease suffering.

01:30:44.155 --> 01:30:51.412
And I love people. Therefore, I'd have
no choice but to kill the son of a bitch.

01:30:59.379 --> 01:31:01.005
You'd never get away alive.

01:31:01.631 --> 01:31:06.385
It doesn't matter. I would kill him.
Nosdrovia. Skol.

01:32:31.971 --> 01:32:33.972
Dear Sarah,

01:32:34.099 --> 01:32:39.186
this is a hard letter to write.
So I'll try and make it short.

01:32:40.522 --> 01:32:44.692
I can't go on hiding anymore.
That's what I've been doing.

01:32:45.443 --> 01:32:50.030
Running and hiding. You know
I've had this figured out all wrong.

01:32:50.782 --> 01:32:53.742
I always thought this power
of mine was a curse.

01:32:53.952 --> 01:33:00.290
Now I can see it's a gift. Anyway,
by the time you get this letter,

01:33:00.458 --> 01:33:05.754
it'll all be over. You never will
understand why, Sarah.

01:33:05.880 --> 01:33:07.464
Guess nobody ever will.

01:33:07.632 --> 01:33:11.802
But I know what I'm doing.
And I know I'm right.

01:33:12.846 --> 01:33:18.475
Just remember there's never
been anyone for me except you.

01:33:20.645 --> 01:33:23.480
Just wasn't in the cards
for us I guess.

01:33:24.983 --> 01:33:28.652
I'll always love you,
Sarah. Johnny.

01:35:53.590 --> 01:35:55.007
Thanks very much.
What's your name?

01:35:55.133 --> 01:35:56.008
Michael.

01:35:58.219 --> 01:36:00.929
Hello, Walt. How are you?
This is your baby?

01:36:01.014 --> 01:36:01.763
Yeah.

01:36:02.140 --> 01:36:04.474
Ah. Bring him up on stage.

01:37:15.380 --> 01:37:18.340
I wanna thank all of you
from the bottom of my heart

01:37:18.466 --> 01:37:20.801
for the tremendous support
you've given this campaign.

01:37:20.969 --> 01:37:24.888
You've made this campaign the most
talked about, the most exciting,

01:37:25.056 --> 01:37:29.142
the most important campaign
in the history of this great state.

01:37:29.268 --> 01:37:31.853
And I've come here personally
to thank you for that.

01:37:42.865 --> 01:37:43.865
Johnny!

01:37:49.622 --> 01:37:53.375
- Give me him!
- Don't! No!

01:37:53.793 --> 01:37:55.877
Sonny someone's trying to kill me.

01:38:38.713 --> 01:38:41.882
Who are you? You son of a bitch.
Who sent you?

01:39:08.159 --> 01:39:09.493
It's over.

01:39:13.998 --> 01:39:15.457
You're finished.

01:39:19.295 --> 01:39:22.422
Who was that kid with
the camera taking pictures?

01:39:22.590 --> 01:39:23.757
I didn't see him.

01:39:23.883 --> 01:39:24.716
You ass-hole.

01:39:35.478 --> 01:39:37.354
It's OK. It's alright.

01:39:52.703 --> 01:39:56.039
Oh Johnny. Why? Why?

01:40:03.506 --> 01:40:04.840
Goodbye.

01:40:09.178 --> 01:40:10.887
I love you.
