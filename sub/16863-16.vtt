00:00.274 --> 00:01.673
Previously onrescue me...

00:01.708 --> 00:03.037
congratulations, probie.

00:03.072 --> 00:04.526
You're now officially a member of the brotherhood

00:04.561 --> 00:06.147
of dysfunctional action junkies.

00:06.182 --> 00:07.994
You stopped being Tommy Gavin today,

00:07.995 --> 00:09.806
and you started playing mother hen to that kid.

00:09.841 --> 00:12.586
I promised his mother that I would keep an eye on him.

00:12.621 --> 00:14.639
From now on, Damien is with Lou.

00:14.674 --> 00:19.044
Knowing that whenever he goes into a fire, you're going to be right by his side

00:19.590 --> 00:21.305
just makes everything better.

00:21.340 --> 00:24.434
So, the benefit for Garrity, help him out with his medical expenses

00:24.435 --> 00:25.860
at the bar this Saturday night.

00:25.895 --> 00:28.472
Maybe you could have your girlfriend invite some of her friends.

00:28.507 --> 00:31.049
You know, I'm sure she's got some hot fillies in her stable, right?

00:31.084 --> 00:32.558
Yeah. Couple of bulls, too, I think.

00:33.106 --> 00:35.573
Carla's not a dyke, Lou.
It was the guys, all right?

00:35.608 --> 00:36.770
You know, they met you,

00:36.805 --> 00:40.271
and, you know, they said they were picking up a slight vive. Oh!

00:40.306 --> 00:42.457
What vibe?

00:43.494 --> 00:44.836
I am not...
an alcoholic.

00:44.871 --> 00:47.401
I'm going to spend the rest of my time on this particular planet

00:47.652 --> 00:48.648
drinking.

00:48.683 --> 00:50.995
You set some example for your sponsee derek there.

00:51.030 --> 00:53.308
Mike says that once Sean's mom and brother take off,

00:53.343 --> 00:54.651
I can move in with those guys.

00:54.686 --> 00:56.802
If they ever find out stupidity's contagious,

00:57.011 --> 00:57.987
you could be in trouble.

00:58.022 --> 01:01.839
We are being nice to each other to gain back our daughter's love and affection.

01:01.874 --> 01:05.911
We're having sex because it is mutually pleasurable.

01:06.019 --> 01:09.153
You knew jonny bones?
Sadly, I never met the man.

01:09.188 --> 01:10.835
Turn the camera off.
No, no, no.

01:10.836 --> 01:13.494
I know you're not angry at me, you're angry at the system, and...

01:13.529 --> 01:15.730
I am angry at the system, but unfortunately for you,

01:15.765 --> 01:18.790
the system doesn't happen to be here. Will you hold my drink, please?

01:18.825 --> 01:21.279
And...
hey get, off me! Hey!

01:24.698 --> 01:28.417
Oh! I love eggs. I do. And bacon.

01:28.511 --> 01:29.452
Ooh, I love the bacon.

01:29.487 --> 01:32.086
L... anything with bacon, really,

01:32.121 --> 01:35.665
you know, like salad or blts or cheeseburgers.

01:35.700 --> 01:39.367
I love cheeseburgers.
Ohh. I would eat bacon 24/7,

01:39.402 --> 01:41.997
only I don't need my ass going all Kim kardashian on me.

01:41.998 --> 01:43.648
You know, whoo-ooh?

01:43.683 --> 01:45.313
I don't think you have to worry about that.

01:50.651 --> 01:56.372
You still love my ass, don't you?
Yeah. Of course. Best ass ever.

02:00.562 --> 02:02.561
You don't think it's too fat?

02:02.596 --> 02:04.058
No.

02:04.093 --> 02:06.966
Would you even tell me if you did?

02:07.001 --> 02:08.776
Yes.

02:08.812 --> 02:12.145
Don't start that now, 'cause you know, I tell you this all the time.

02:12.146 --> 02:16.625
I mean, you could...
literally, you could eat that plate of bacon every day.

02:16.660 --> 02:20.675
You'd have to eat all the neighborhood bacon every morning.

02:20.710 --> 02:23.625
You could eat all the American bacon and all the canadian bacon.

02:23.660 --> 02:25.608
You'd have to, you know...

02:25.706 --> 02:30.175
you're tiny, and you're a little spinner.

02:32.827 --> 02:35.892
What made you say canadian bacon?

02:35.927 --> 02:37.885
L... you know.

02:38.398 --> 02:40.621
I was just talking about how much bacon you'd have to eat.

02:40.699 --> 02:42.058
You know what I mean? I just used canadian bacon

02:42.059 --> 02:44.466
'cause I don't think think there's a european...

02:44.501 --> 02:49.389
they don't have their own...
'cause what's-her-face is from toronto.

02:54.350 --> 02:58.388
Uh, I don't think I know what we're talking about anymore.

03:04.264 --> 03:05.996
That chick...

03:05.997 --> 03:10.356
from Jennifer's birthday party.

03:10.662 --> 03:13.294
You know the one, the one with the big tits,

03:13.295 --> 03:18.071
the blonde with the angora sweater that you were talking to and flirting with...

03:18.106 --> 03:20.966
I wasn't flirting with her.
And making googoo eyeballs at.

03:21.001 --> 03:23.040
What am I talking about? You don't even know who Jennifer is,

03:23.103 --> 03:25.024
much less her birthday party,

03:25.025 --> 03:28.158
or the fact that that fatass bimbo is from canada.

03:28.263 --> 03:31.035
But I bet you do remember her tits, right?

03:31.048 --> 03:32.956
As a matter of fact, I bet that you are picturing her

03:32.957 --> 03:35.340
tits right now in your head.

03:38.685 --> 03:41.765
I'm not... I... OK. OK. L...

03:42.297 --> 03:45.142
I didn't know she was from canada, and the only reason... I'm not even thinking about...

03:45.177 --> 03:47.348
I'm thinking about the sweater is what I'm picturing,

03:47.383 --> 03:50.551
because you br... you know, talked about the...
the... because...

03:50.552 --> 03:51.515
it was fluffy.

03:51.550 --> 03:54.002
That's what you just reminded me of.

03:55.682 --> 03:57.826
Oh. Was it fluffy?

03:58.149 --> 04:03.454
Did you want to pet it 'cause it was so fluffy and filled with fake tit?

04:03.489 --> 04:05.151
'Cause, you know, those tits were fake.

04:05.186 --> 04:07.754
They're faker than donatella versace's forehead.

04:08.639 --> 04:11.861
And I ain't making you a goddamn fritta, you ass-face!

04:12.261 --> 04:17.547
Maybe I should make you a tittata, huh? Maybe a fluffy titta?

04:25.391 --> 04:27.046
Listen...
just shut it down.

04:27.081 --> 04:28.140
You brought up...
shh.

contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:38.000 --> 04:42.163
Would you like red and green peppers, or just red?

04:43.223 --> 04:46.863
You know, whatever. Whatever.
Just, you know...

04:48.297 --> 04:50.164
whatever?

04:51.643 --> 04:53.454
Mean, you know, whatever...

04:53.489 --> 04:56.641
whatever you're chopping there, it's great... everything's good.

04:56.676 --> 04:57.767
It's all good.

04:58.296 --> 04:59.789
What?

05:02.169 --> 05:04.314
No, no. Sheil... I...

05:05.445 --> 05:07.251
listen.

05:07.666 --> 05:10.306
Sheila. Wait. I didn't...

05:10.407 --> 05:13.538
I never thought about that...

05:14.583 --> 05:16.312
Christ.

05:20.988 --> 05:22.362
Good morning, sunshine.

05:22.397 --> 05:23.550
What did... what did I say?

05:23.585 --> 05:26.691
What'd you say? First of all, you said, "fluffy."

05:27.112 --> 05:31.211
Then, you said "whatever" when she asked you about red or green peppers.

05:31.902 --> 05:33.824
What you should have said was either,

05:33.825 --> 05:36.109
"oh, both. Both would be fantastic, baby,"

05:36.219 --> 05:40.170
"or almost immediately, "you treat me so goddamn good"

05:40.205 --> 05:42.911
as you snuggled up behind her and gave her a great big hug.

05:42.912 --> 05:44.915
But you didn't. It's OK.

05:44.916 --> 05:47.351
Let's forget about the peppers for a moment.

05:47.386 --> 05:51.347
I need to know when are you going to tell her about the new situation with Damian?

05:51.387 --> 05:56.582
Because, by the way, as I told you, I'm fine with it 'cause I love Lou. I trust Lou.

05:58.048 --> 06:00.851
I figure between you and Lou and the pussy,

06:00.886 --> 06:03.483
Damian's dynamite.
Which pussy?

06:03.518 --> 06:04.723
Which pussy? What do you...

06:04.758 --> 06:08.003
you know, the kid. The kid with the hair and the skin creams.

06:08.038 --> 06:10.833
Silletti.
Whatever. The point is...

06:11.219 --> 06:13.901
the point is, I know Damian's in good hands, right?

06:13.936 --> 06:17.815
But you better let her know now, God damn it.

06:18.144 --> 06:19.806
What?

06:20.442 --> 06:22.206
Whatever.

06:22.280 --> 06:24.670
Oh, shit. It's her.

06:31.944 --> 06:34.041
What have you... what have you got?

06:35.583 --> 06:38.615
My meds. I forgot my meds.

06:38.650 --> 06:41.504
That's why I was a little jumpy

06:41.646 --> 06:42.926
before.

06:43.758 --> 06:45.490
Oh! Vegetables.

06:59.301 --> 07:01.395
So...

07:02.210 --> 07:03.843
I, uh...

07:04.271 --> 07:07.613
I wanted to tell you something.
Shoot.

07:08.947 --> 07:11.292
How many of those do you take?

07:14.004 --> 07:15.833
You really want to know?

07:17.865 --> 07:20.286
This is ativan.
Right.

07:20.321 --> 07:21.978
For anti-anxiety.

07:22.034 --> 07:26.105
This is xanax, also for anti-anxiety

07:26.725 --> 07:29.747
because my shrink doesn't want to tell her doctor friend

07:29.844 --> 07:32.259
that the ativan isn't enough to calm me down,

07:32.260 --> 07:35.431
so I got to go to a second shrink and really pour it on with her

07:35.432 --> 07:37.668
so that she'll get her doctor friend

07:37.669 --> 07:39.717
to double me up, which is nice.

07:39.718 --> 07:43.197
Now, this one is the adderall,

07:43.232 --> 07:46.334
which counteracts how sleepy these 2 make me

07:46.335 --> 07:50.659
and also gives me an extra little boost in the morning, you know,

07:50.660 --> 07:54.915
just so that I'm really, really excited about the day ahead.

07:54.916 --> 07:59.569
And then, these are related to my libido

07:59.637 --> 08:03.533
and my terror sweats that I get.

08:06.737 --> 08:08.764
What did you want to tell me?

08:08.799 --> 08:12.364
Uh, you get terror sweats?

08:12.399 --> 08:14.273
I do.

08:14.308 --> 08:16.147
Well...

08:17.241 --> 08:19.521
I... what did I want?

08:20.042 --> 08:22.037
I wanted to...

08:22.072 --> 08:23.459
wanted to tell you,

08:25.249 --> 08:27.395
how...

08:28.453 --> 08:30.689
cute and...

08:30.724 --> 08:33.551
sexy your little round

08:33.586 --> 08:34.522
ass is. That's what I was...

08:34.957 --> 08:37.118
is that true?
Yup!

08:38.328 --> 08:41.426
It's so nice of you to make me this big breakfast and...

08:42.019 --> 08:44.804
yeah. That's what I was going to tell you.

08:51.044 --> 08:52.408
Don't get it.

08:52.443 --> 08:53.772
I got to.

08:55.522 --> 08:57.363
Yeah?
Morning, Tom.

08:57.398 --> 08:59.502
You got the news on this morning?
No.

08:59.537 --> 09:01.144
Why don't you put it on channel 12

09:01.179 --> 09:03.105
and get your ass down here pronto, shithead?

09:03.140 --> 09:04.795
OK. Turn that TV on,

09:04.830 --> 09:07.366
channel 12.
See the cover of thedaily newstoday?

09:07.401 --> 09:08.239
No.

09:08.274 --> 09:09.990
Well, you're on the front page, my friend.

09:10.747 --> 09:11.543
Do me a favor

09:11.578 --> 09:13.800
promise me you'll sign my copy first.

09:13.835 --> 09:16.430
The system doesn't happen to be here. Will you hold my drink, please? And...

09:16.914 --> 09:18.759
what are you doing?
Oh, no.

09:18.794 --> 09:19.831
Firefighter Gavin then started...

09:19.866 --> 09:21.711
wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
What can only be described as a drunken brawl.

09:21.746 --> 09:23.911
That was my first drink.

09:23.946 --> 09:25.796
I hadn't even taken a sip of that yet.

09:25.831 --> 09:27.023
Jumped in to break up the...

09:31.179 --> 09:33.695
dedication deteriorated into chaos.

09:33.730 --> 09:36.850
You are so cute when...

09:36.885 --> 09:38.199
when I'm angry?

09:38.234 --> 09:40.489
No. When you're fighting.

09:40.524 --> 09:42.662
At the time, the 2 were fighting...

09:42.697 --> 09:44.639
I got to go. Aw, man.

09:45.795 --> 09:46.951
Son of a bitch!

10:41.796 --> 10:43.402
What?

10:44.025 --> 10:46.179
I got Irish influenza.

10:46.214 --> 10:48.088
I only meant to have one drink last night.

10:48.123 --> 10:50.856
Just unwind, sitting at my local.

10:50.891 --> 10:52.608
I was feeling pretty good

10:52.643 --> 10:54.198
then the late news comes on,

10:54.438 --> 10:56.330
and there you are...
true to form,

10:56.430 --> 10:57.837
carrying on like an asshole.

10:57.872 --> 11:00.636
OK...
only this time, this camera's in the room.

11:00.671 --> 11:02.464
So one becomes 2,

11:02.499 --> 11:05.149
2 becomes 4, 4 becomes 8.

11:05.491 --> 11:07.087
Congratulations, Tommy.

11:07.122 --> 11:09.601
You're the first man who's ever driven me to drink, other than the mets.

11:09.636 --> 11:10.707
I wasn't drinking.

11:10.742 --> 11:13.026
No? What was that, iced tea in your rocks glass?

11:13.061 --> 11:14.269
It was my first drink.

11:14.338 --> 11:15.806
I hadn't taken a sip of it yet.

11:17.453 --> 11:18.867
Listen.

11:18.902 --> 11:22.027
You, me, and bonesy used to go out and get shitfaced together all the time,

11:22.062 --> 11:25.152
and we ended up having an argument about which guy was the least shitfaced

11:25.187 --> 11:27.528
cause that was the guy that was going to drive home, OK?

11:27.563 --> 11:29.888
He was a great fireman, he was a good guy,

11:29.923 --> 11:33.919
and that sleazy, fat prick was trying to use his memory

11:34.019 --> 11:35.016
for a political campaign.

11:35.116 --> 11:37.678
He's a politician. That's what they do.

11:37.738 --> 11:40.322
I didn't go in there looking for trouble.
You never do, Tommy,

11:40.357 --> 11:43.328
but it always seems to be going off in your vicinity.

11:43.363 --> 11:45.564
But hey, that's why you do what you do and I do what I do.

11:47.367 --> 11:48.742
Yeah. That's right.

11:48.777 --> 11:52.494
I fight fires, and you push paper.

11:52.529 --> 11:55.778
Yeah. That joke never gets old.
No joke, pal.

11:58.860 --> 12:00.811
What happened to us, Tommy, huh?

12:00.846 --> 12:02.780
We went to the academy together.

12:02.815 --> 12:04.680
Yeah.
We did jobs together.

12:04.715 --> 12:07.747
We lost brothers together. And we looked out for each other.

12:07.782 --> 12:12.105
We were friends.
Yep. We were.

12:15.168 --> 12:17.384
You treat Jerry this way?

12:19.404 --> 12:21.376
Huh? Did you give him agita on a daily basis

12:21.476 --> 12:22.884
to the point where he's shitting blood?

12:25.779 --> 12:27.805
Tell me something, Tommy.

12:27.840 --> 12:31.233
Am I going to end up with a gun in my mouth, too?

12:40.643 --> 12:42.323
Go ahead. That's it.

12:42.358 --> 12:43.562
Hit your superior officer.

12:43.597 --> 12:45.118
Yeah, I will.
Do it.

12:45.153 --> 12:48.922
Yeah.
Here. Take this.

12:48.957 --> 12:51.716
Split my skull open. You stupid son of a bitch.

12:51.751 --> 12:53.468
Don't you think I would love to throw on the bunker gear

12:53.503 --> 12:55.717
and charge into a burn with you again?

12:55.752 --> 12:57.433
I can't do that anymore.

12:57.468 --> 13:01.170
I got a responsibility to the families of these men to keep them safe.

13:01.640 --> 13:03.059
God forbid you die,

13:03.094 --> 13:04.363
I got to go to your house,

13:04.398 --> 13:05.597
I got to ring your bell

13:05.632 --> 13:09.467
and I got to tell Janet her husband's never coming home.

13:09.826 --> 13:11.118
Then I got to tell colleen

13:11.329 --> 13:13.490
that her father's not going to be at her wedding.

13:14.346 --> 13:18.312
And then I got to tell katy that daddy's dead.

13:29.865 --> 13:32.628
Faggot.
Pussy.

13:36.998 --> 13:39.030
All right, look. Here's the deal.

13:39.773 --> 13:41.434
You quit drinking for a while,

13:41.469 --> 13:44.506
and then I can tell the brass we got all this under control.

13:44.941 --> 13:48.248
Now, if you refuse, our new probie, your godson,

13:48.283 --> 13:49.889
who I fought to get in this house...

13:49.917 --> 13:51.117
yeah.
Because you begged me

13:51.152 --> 13:52.798
to do the right thing by him and you...
mm-hmm.

13:53.428 --> 13:54.584
He'll be relieved

13:55.046 --> 13:57.664
of all the shit duties as they pertain to cleaning this place.

13:58.161 --> 13:59.924
And those duties will fall on you.

14:00.560 --> 14:02.269
I'm not doing that shit.

14:02.304 --> 14:04.941
A week. Quit drinking for a week.

14:05.627 --> 14:07.054
I can do that in my sleep.

14:07.744 --> 14:09.875
How about 2?

14:09.910 --> 14:11.530
OK.

14:12.534 --> 14:14.060
The deal is 30 days.

14:14.095 --> 14:17.203
You quit drinking for 30 days.

14:20.024 --> 14:21.530
In a row?

14:26.220 --> 14:29.510
This is better than watching one of those Jason bourne movies. We got any popcorn?

14:29.545 --> 14:31.498
I sent the probie down the block to get some.

14:31.533 --> 14:32.866
Swear to God, I haven't seen Tommy

14:32.901 --> 14:35.782
clean a thing in this fire house since he was strung out on happy pills.

14:35.817 --> 14:37.305
Do you think he's on happy pills now?

14:37.340 --> 14:39.941
Do I look like I'm on goddamn happy pills, asshole?

14:40.328 --> 14:41.498
Turn the camera off, Lou.

14:41.533 --> 14:43.597
Ooh, close-up. Close-up.
Nope.

14:43.632 --> 14:44.980
Happy pills or not,

14:45.015 --> 14:46.686
he does have a knack for this.

14:46.721 --> 14:48.144
Yeah. You see what he did in the bathroom?

14:48.179 --> 14:49.533
Aw, amazing.
Beautiful, man.

14:49.568 --> 14:52.176
I had a hard time dropping a deuce in that toilet, it was so clean.

14:52.211 --> 14:55.497
Had 4 cups of coffee and bran flakes for breakfast.

14:55.532 --> 14:56.504
You had bran flakes?

14:56.604 --> 14:58.464
Yeah. We're all out of pancake batter.

14:58.976 --> 15:00.359
And the urinals,

15:00.394 --> 15:02.416
I could see my reflection in the porcelain.

15:02.451 --> 15:04.438
It was like taking a piss on my own face.

15:05.359 --> 15:06.649
And there he is

15:06.940 --> 15:08.519
get the popcorn? Yeah.

15:08.554 --> 15:11.181
Good. Go throw it in the nuker 'cause we need more treats.

15:11.484 --> 15:13.689
Hey, you guys aren't going to believe what I just saw across the street.

15:13.724 --> 15:16.470
What did you see across the street?

15:31.345 --> 15:34.470
No sudden moves. We don't want to frighten her off.

15:38.503 --> 15:39.550
Hi. Can we help you?

15:39.585 --> 15:41.246
Privet.

15:41.318 --> 15:43.938
Oh, DA, DA. DA. Upstairs.

15:44.937 --> 15:46.620
OK. Um, hey, davy,

15:46.720 --> 15:49.643
would you take this lovely young lady upstairs to see needles?

15:49.818 --> 15:51.270
Chief Nelson.
DA!

15:52.722 --> 15:55.094
DA. DA. All right, Davey.
You got it Lou.

15:55.129 --> 15:56.444
Thank you.

15:57.144 --> 16:00.398
OK. Who the hell is that, and why is she looking for needles?

16:00.433 --> 16:03.430
Well, that, my dear friends, is Mrs. Needles.

16:03.650 --> 16:05.547
Since when is there a Mrs. Needles?

16:05.582 --> 16:07.769
Since about 2 weeks ago, when she came over from russia.

16:07.804 --> 16:09.957
This is the thing Feinberg was talking about, mail-order bride.

16:10.446 --> 16:12.494
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. So needles got a russian mail-order bride?

16:12.529 --> 16:13.969
Yes, says Feinberg.

16:14.004 --> 16:15.722
You know, apparently he was so tired of taking shit

16:15.723 --> 16:17.311
from far less attractive American women...

16:17.346 --> 16:18.315
who isn't?

16:18.350 --> 16:20.223
That he jumped online and ordered himself a bride.

16:20.258 --> 16:22.938
I thought he was already married.
Was married. Nasty divorce.

16:22.973 --> 16:25.157
The wife got everything...
alimony, the kid.

16:25.192 --> 16:26.370
You don't have to worry about any of that shit

16:26.470 --> 16:27.869
with a russian mail-order bride.

16:27.904 --> 16:30.633
Yeah, what, do they grow them on, like, farms over there or something?

16:30.668 --> 16:31.437
Well, not really.

16:31.472 --> 16:34.319
It's the second biggest export in russia next to vodka...

16:34.354 --> 16:35.438
good-lookin' broads.

16:35.473 --> 16:38.333
Man, I'd love to introduce her to Dr. Zhivago.

16:39.272 --> 16:42.360
Did you just refer to your shit as Dr. Zhivago?

16:42.395 --> 16:43.938
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Just with russian chicks, though.

16:44.014 --> 16:46.132
You know, if they're Irish chicks, it's Michael collins,

16:46.335 --> 16:47.810
with French chicks, it's napoleon

16:47.845 --> 16:49.251
british chicks, it's king Arthur.

16:49.286 --> 16:51.536
King Arthur, huh?
Yeah. It used to be David beckham,

16:51.571 --> 16:53.121
but too many chicks have seenbend it like beckham,

16:53.156 --> 16:55.191
so got a little dangerous, you know.

16:55.226 --> 16:57.223
She had an amazing frame, huh?
Yeah.

16:57.258 --> 16:58.639
I like her pussy belt.
Mm-hmm.

16:58.703 --> 17:00.667
What the hell's a pussy belt?

17:00.702 --> 17:02.730
It's a super short skirt, like it's just there to hold up the pussy.

17:02.765 --> 17:04.486
Or her underwears.

17:06.575 --> 17:08.531
She's not wearing any.

17:08.910 --> 17:09.616
Excuse us?

17:09.651 --> 17:11.422
Yeah. That's what I was trying to tell you guys.

17:11.457 --> 17:12.851
I saw her getting out of her car.

17:12.886 --> 17:16.194
I got a full-on, low angle britney Spears.

17:16.230 --> 17:18.700
Oh, my God. A glorious sight like that wasted on a probie.

17:18.734 --> 17:19.810
Wow.
That's not fair.

17:19.846 --> 17:21.826
Is there anything else of interest you have to tell us?

17:21.861 --> 17:23.558
Birthmarks, Bush size,

17:23.657 --> 17:26.185
any sign at all of male-female genitalia?

17:26.218 --> 17:28.511
Uh, well, if she did just come from russia,

17:28.546 --> 17:30.547
then it must be unseasonably warm there

17:31.012 --> 17:34.294
because she's totally shaved.
Oh!

17:35.608 --> 17:38.219
A shaved russian.
Oh, it sounds like a drink.

17:38.254 --> 17:41.295
So, Mrs. Needles is walking around the firehouse

17:41.330 --> 17:44.229
wearing a pussy belt and no underwears.

17:44.264 --> 17:45.812
Says the probie.

17:45.847 --> 17:48.231
What, you think I'm lying?

17:48.982 --> 17:53.184
Have you ever even seen a real, life, breathing vagina?

17:53.464 --> 17:55.986
I'm not talking about in a magazine or on the internet.

17:56.021 --> 17:57.137
I'm talking live in the flesh.

17:57.172 --> 17:57.948
Yeah.
Yeah.

17:57.983 --> 17:59.245
Franco's right. We need confirmation.

17:59.280 --> 18:01.667
You can't leave this shit to the word of a probie. It's too crucial.

18:01.702 --> 18:03.084
I feel a bet coming on, son.

18:03.085 --> 18:06.278
All right. Here's the thing.
Here's the thing. The first one of us that gets confirmation

18:06.313 --> 18:08.364
that Mrs. Needles is parading around

18:08.464 --> 18:10.604
without panties underneath her pussy belt

18:10.704 --> 18:12.186
is the winner.
Winner of what?

18:12.221 --> 18:15.451
A first-hand, up-close look at Mrs. Needles' vagina.

18:19.536 --> 18:23.388
They'll sleep tonight.
When did you learn how to speak russian?

18:23.423 --> 18:24.987
Russian phone sex lines.

18:25.390 --> 18:26.944
Yeah. I was thinking about picking up a second language

18:27.016 --> 18:29.972
and I was really horny, so, you know, 2 birds, one stone.

18:30.796 --> 18:34.499
OK. Well, let's see where we were.

18:35.408 --> 18:39.077
Ahh. OK. And action, Tommy.

18:40.148 --> 18:42.185
Thanks for bringing down the borscht, babe.

18:42.852 --> 18:45.369
Listen, I'd walk you out, but the phones are going crazy.

18:45.404 --> 18:46.442
You going to be all right?

18:46.477 --> 18:47.943
DA.
DA.

19:02.127 --> 19:04.084
Oh, hi. Hi. How, you doing?

19:04.119 --> 19:05.752
L... sorry. I didn't see you coming.

19:05.787 --> 19:07.385
I just got my head in these reports, you know.

19:08.430 --> 19:10.142
I drop my... I dropped my pencil.

19:10.177 --> 19:12.282
I'm going to need that later.

19:19.300 --> 19:24.120
OK. Well, it's nice seeing you again.

19:24.447 --> 19:26.599
And have a good day. I got some work to do down here.

19:27.185 --> 19:29.195
I'll see you around.

19:33.312 --> 19:35.026
God damn.

19:35.226 --> 19:37.661
What the hell's the matter with you?
Am I getting fat?

19:37.696 --> 19:38.994
ER?
Yeah.

19:50.460 --> 19:51.510
16.

19:52.417 --> 19:57.711
Oh. Hey. Did you find him?
Chief Nelson?

19:57.746 --> 19:59.675
DA, DA.
Ah, good.

20:04.375 --> 20:05.587
Huh?
Yeah, sure.

20:07.787 --> 20:09.591
Hey, don't be shy, girl. Come on in.

20:10.565 --> 20:12.330
Sure. Rest yourself.

20:13.432 --> 20:14.636
Yeah.

20:17.565 --> 20:19.922
Thank you.
Sure.

20:20.934 --> 20:24.130
I'm just getting in a little workout.
I'm a boxer,

20:24.230 --> 20:25.454
so got to stay fit.

20:25.514 --> 20:27.982
Shoulders, arms, chest.

20:29.188 --> 20:30.440
Abs.

20:32.531 --> 20:35.666
Oh! God damn. Son of a bitch.
Douchebag. Asshole. Shitface.

20:51.188 --> 20:52.516
Hi.

21:11.924 --> 21:14.904
Who is it?
Get out here.

21:17.959 --> 21:19.679
What the hell are you doing?
Didn't I tell you to clean the rig?

21:19.714 --> 21:22.631
Yeah. I cleaned the top part.
Now,

21:22.731 --> 21:24.300
I'm cleaning the bottom.

21:25.586 --> 21:27.697
Very thorough.
Yes.

21:27.732 --> 21:29.768
Did you see snezyana?

21:30.330 --> 21:34.885
Snezyana. Um, a white waiter hat, Brown skirt?

21:34.920 --> 21:37.475
Yeah. See the legs?
Oh, yeah.

21:37.510 --> 21:40.178
My wife.
Nice.

21:40.973 --> 21:43.621
All right. Go clean the storeroom when you get done, handsome. It's a mess.

21:44.369 --> 21:46.056
You got it.

21:52.252 --> 21:53.667
Hi.

21:53.948 --> 21:55.414
Are you kidding me?

21:55.449 --> 21:56.931
Nope.

21:58.535 --> 22:00.999
Well, did you see it?

22:01.280 --> 22:03.122
What do you think?

22:03.579 --> 22:04.815
Let me put it this way...

22:05.388 --> 22:09.017
I'm a new toolbox away from being her gynecologist.

22:10.936 --> 22:11.936
Bye.

22:15.228 --> 22:16.235
Ow! Shit.

22:16.735 --> 22:18.500
God damn it.

22:19.083 --> 22:22.041
It's like cleaning stevie wonder's goddamn basement in here.

22:22.630 --> 22:24.022
Hey.
Shit! Hey.

22:24.549 --> 22:25.549
What are you doing here?

22:25.699 --> 22:27.975
You OK?
Yeah. What's going on?

22:28.238 --> 22:30.975
Ah, the guys told me that needles has you in the doghouse.

22:31.010 --> 22:33.712
OK, listen. I had a drink in my hand, but I had not even...

22:33.747 --> 22:36.599
I just came to show you this.

22:38.096 --> 22:39.550
What is it?

22:39.876 --> 22:42.538
It's a letter from katy.
Oh. Yeah.

22:42.573 --> 22:46.396
Yes. And what a great day she had shopping with us and having lunch and the whole...

22:47.096 --> 22:48.469
honey, really?

22:48.504 --> 22:50.562
OK. And she actually mentioned me as mom 4 times,

22:50.597 --> 22:52.621
not to mention the "dear mom" at the top.

22:52.656 --> 22:53.805
Oh, that's awesome.

22:53.840 --> 22:59.064
And this is the perfect situation and location. Mmm!

22:59.391 --> 23:00.955
For a quickie.
No, no, no.

23:00.990 --> 23:02.087
No, honey, no. Don't.

23:02.122 --> 23:04.198
Sweetheart. Yes. We used to do this all the time.

23:04.233 --> 23:06.239
I know. Honey...
it was so good.

23:06.274 --> 23:08.111
Doghouse.
Honey, it was so good.

23:08.146 --> 23:09.168
Doghouse.

23:09.768 --> 23:12.069
Needles gave me a...
those delicious eyes.

23:12.169 --> 23:14.610
Honey. No. No. You...

23:14.645 --> 23:17.052
yes, yes.
What...

23:17.152 --> 23:18.516
Jesus Christ.
Come on.

23:18.551 --> 23:23.475
That's right. That's right.
That's right.

23:23.665 --> 23:26.987
Oh, my God, honey. Jesus, Mary, and Joseph.

23:27.022 --> 23:29.326
Baby, wait.
OK.

23:30.324 --> 23:31.511
I can't...

23:31.901 --> 23:33.056
unh. Can you see?
No.

23:33.091 --> 23:34.211
There we go.
Oh, yeah.

23:34.246 --> 23:35.679
Oh, yeah.

23:55.307 --> 23:57.131
Oh, this is going to be quick, honey.

23:59.741 --> 24:00.872
Tom?

24:02.472 --> 24:04.411
Tommy?
Yeah? Yeah?

24:04.446 --> 24:06.685
Everything all right in there?

24:06.720 --> 24:08.924
Yes! Scrubbing.

24:09.855 --> 24:13.032
You guys got to start picking up after yourselves.

24:13.132 --> 24:15.503
I'm not... I'm not a maid!

24:15.574 --> 24:16.990
Yep.

24:18.701 --> 24:19.732
OK.

24:19.767 --> 24:23.477
Oh, my God. Oh, that was awesome.

24:24.135 --> 24:25.550
Ohh.
Oh, my God.

24:25.585 --> 24:28.716
See? Oh, my God, that was good.

24:28.810 --> 24:30.421
OK, we got to clean up.

24:32.999 --> 24:35.358
Ohh.
Holy shit. I got to tell you.

24:35.792 --> 24:39.959
You know, this is great, but we got to go out, you know?

24:40.753 --> 24:42.360
What do you mean?

24:42.611 --> 24:45.863
You know, out, like on a date.

24:46.479 --> 24:47.412
Like with katy?

24:47.447 --> 24:49.621
No, no. Us. You know,

24:50.026 --> 24:52.420
dinner and a movie.

24:53.624 --> 24:55.117
Tommy, come on.

24:55.152 --> 24:56.547
This was a date.

24:56.582 --> 24:57.644
No, honey, no.

24:57.679 --> 25:02.092
Yes, yes. You know, let's just consider this a dinner and a movie,

25:02.127 --> 25:07.477
and we just skipped, like, the dinner and the movie, OK?

25:08.053 --> 25:09.313
Do I look... do I look all right?

25:09.348 --> 25:11.817
Yeah, you're fine. Jesus.
Done yet, Gavin?

25:12.317 --> 25:13.289
Oh, it's you.

25:13.324 --> 25:15.423
Hey, you know what? I was actually just leaving.

25:15.777 --> 25:18.429
I had some really great news for Tommy.

25:19.745 --> 25:22.789
Mm-hmm. You know what? Katy just got straight as.

25:25.012 --> 25:27.202
Yes. She's doing...

25:28.210 --> 25:30.879
great in school. These guys.

25:30.979 --> 25:31.886
It's just...
just... I mean, it's...

25:32.043 --> 25:34.319
ah, raised by wolves.

25:34.419 --> 25:35.689
It's unbelievable. I mean, it's like they just have no...

25:36.213 --> 25:37.687
animals, every one of them.
Yes.

25:37.722 --> 25:40.862
And I'm thinking 30 seconds earlier, and I would have caught you.

25:41.549 --> 25:42.608
What?

25:43.221 --> 25:44.948
Those yours?

25:52.817 --> 25:55.435
Hmm. You know, my wife stopped by earlier today.
Yeah.

25:55.470 --> 25:57.947
She didn't leave anything like that behind.

25:58.546 --> 26:00.683
'Cause she wasn't wearing any.

26:00.900 --> 26:01.962
Yeah, dude, it's totally sweet.

26:01.997 --> 26:03.769
I mean, the sofa's really comfortable.

26:03.869 --> 26:05.626
It's got, like, one of those pull-out beds,

26:05.726 --> 26:09.702
100% genuine leather, and I got a sick deal on it.

26:09.737 --> 26:12.300
Cool.
Hey! What's going on?

26:12.335 --> 26:14.021
What's happening?

26:14.056 --> 26:15.100
How are you?
Good.

26:15.135 --> 26:16.552
You doing a little couch surfing for a while?

26:16.587 --> 26:17.935
Yeah. Hope you don't mind.

26:17.970 --> 26:19.650
No. Hey, man, Mike's casa E su casa.

26:19.822 --> 26:22.323
He got a good deal, by the way. That's genuine leather, really expensive stuff.

26:22.423 --> 26:24.406
Cool. Hey, congrats on not dying, by the way.

26:24.441 --> 26:28.143
Thank you. I got a whole new outlook on life, my friend.

26:28.178 --> 26:30.257
No regrets, you know. I'm just going

26:30.953 --> 26:33.120
to live the day, you know what I mean? Carp diem.

26:33.155 --> 26:34.015
Hey, what's that?

26:34.050 --> 26:35.548
It's a Roman term.

26:35.648 --> 26:37.476
It means, you know, live for the now.

26:37.576 --> 26:39.975
Seize the day. And it's actually carpe diem.

26:40.084 --> 26:41.965
Well, that's Roman for carp.

26:42.000 --> 26:43.472
No, I don't think so.

26:44.782 --> 26:45.884
Actually, yeah,

26:46.108 --> 26:48.260
I think it is, my friend. You see, fish,

26:48.360 --> 26:50.648
they live a very limited lifespan, so by nature,

26:50.683 --> 26:53.878
they simply must live for the now.

26:54.298 --> 26:57.718
It's basically the basis for the entire expression, bro.

26:57.753 --> 26:59.463
The lifespan of a fish?

26:59.498 --> 27:01.407
Yeah, man. You learn something new every day, huh?

27:01.442 --> 27:03.317
Hey, you guys got a gig coming up, don't you?

27:03.352 --> 27:04.178
Yeah.

27:04.213 --> 27:05.707
Sweet. You excited?
Big time, dude.

27:05.742 --> 27:07.101
Hell yeah.
Sweet.

27:07.136 --> 27:10.008
What's the name of the band again? Indian rugburn?

27:10.710 --> 27:12.517
Apache stone, dude.

27:12.552 --> 27:13.754
Apache stone. Sounds like

27:13.854 --> 27:16.359
joba chamberlain just lit up a doobie in the bullpen.

27:17.855 --> 27:19.663
Joba chamberlain's an indian?
Yeah, man.

27:19.698 --> 27:21.128
Ah. I thought he was a yankee.

27:21.163 --> 27:23.216
Hey, are there going to be chicks at this thing?

27:23.251 --> 27:25.234
Aw, dude, mad.
Really?

27:25.269 --> 27:27.431
Yeah. Franc says that he's going to have his lesbo girlfriend, you know,

27:27.466 --> 27:29.593
invite some of her hot chick lesbo friends.

27:29.693 --> 27:30.674
So we're in, dude.

27:30.774 --> 27:32.810
Mike, I got enough trouble with regular vaginas.

27:32.845 --> 27:34.920
You're going to invite a bunch of vaginas into a room that, like,

27:34.955 --> 27:36.980
are attracted to other vaginas?
What the hell is that? Come on.

27:37.015 --> 27:38.291
It's like math. I hate math.

27:38.391 --> 27:39.344
Even vagina math.

27:39.444 --> 27:40.890
Most of these chicks go both ways, right?

27:40.990 --> 27:44.031
I mean, franc says he's having the best sex of his life, dude.

27:44.751 --> 27:47.058
All right. Could we give them, like, a special bracelet

27:47.093 --> 27:49.019
or something at the door so we know which one of these

27:49.054 --> 27:51.515
fuzz-bumpers go both ways? It's supposed to be a party, right?

27:51.615 --> 27:54.601
If there's any work involved, I'd rather just stay home and rub one out by myself.

27:54.636 --> 27:56.657
Yes, but would a carp do that?

27:57.044 --> 27:59.909
You're right. He's right. Did you see that?

27:59.944 --> 28:03.719
The student became the teacher. Touche, my friend.

28:04.211 --> 28:05.968
OK, girl, cool. Bring 'em all.

28:06.360 --> 28:09.397
Yeah. Yeah. I'll see you then.

28:10.397 --> 28:12.886
All right.
My girls are in.

28:12.986 --> 28:14.298
Yeah?
Yeah.

28:14.490 --> 28:15.664
Aw. How many are we talking?

28:15.699 --> 28:18.321
10 or so, I think.
Holy shit.

28:18.356 --> 28:20.943
And they may bring some of their own friends, too.

28:20.978 --> 28:22.208
Sweet.
Mm-hmm.

28:22.243 --> 28:23.403
They hot?

28:23.438 --> 28:25.311
You looking to get lucky?

28:25.346 --> 28:27.184
Baby, I already am lucky, duh. All right?

28:27.284 --> 28:28.549
But it's good for business.

28:29.324 --> 28:31.638
Don't worry about it. My girls are hot.

28:31.673 --> 28:35.544
Do you think I'm the type of girl that rolls with some cockeyed bitches?

28:36.122 --> 28:37.996
Cock... eyed?

28:38.290 --> 28:39.400
Busted. Ugly.

28:39.899 --> 28:41.109
Oh. Right.

28:42.502 --> 28:44.929
So, they're girly-type girls, right?

28:45.526 --> 28:47.532
What kind of question is that?

28:47.567 --> 28:49.539
Uh, it's just a regular question.

28:49.639 --> 28:51.438
I just want the guys to know what to expect, is all.

28:51.538 --> 28:53.392
You're still hung up on that dyke bullshit.

28:53.427 --> 28:55.266
Nah.
Yeah.

28:55.301 --> 28:58.382
All right. A little bit, maybe.
Iook, baby, you got to understand.

28:58.417 --> 29:00.135
Where I work, the guys, they're relentless.

29:00.170 --> 29:01.854
So, you think I'm a lesbo 'cause

29:01.954 --> 29:03.601
your friends at work think I'm a lesbo.

29:03.636 --> 29:05.439
Hey, I don't think that, OK?

29:05.474 --> 29:07.242
I've just been thinking about it.

29:08.770 --> 29:10.163
You know, I met your friends, Franco.

29:10.263 --> 29:11.875
They seem like a nice bunch of guys. But now,

29:12.190 --> 29:14.770
I think it's a case of them using

29:14.870 --> 29:17.726
good looks and humor to make up for a lack of intelligence.

29:17.777 --> 29:18.942
I don't follow.

29:19.223 --> 29:20.490
They're idiots.

29:20.525 --> 29:22.593
Yeah, yeah. Of course they are. I mean, you know,

29:22.628 --> 29:24.695
we're all idiots at some time or another, right?

29:24.730 --> 29:25.980
No. I think

29:26.417 --> 29:28.861
they're punching the idiot clock pretty much 9:00 to 5:00

29:28.961 --> 29:30.596
and during their off hours.

29:31.018 --> 29:33.472
And you can tell they're idiots just from a few quick hellos?

29:33.507 --> 29:34.912
It's a little judgmental, don't you think?

29:34.947 --> 29:38.630
Oh well. Never start a fight if you're not willing to get hit back.

29:38.880 --> 29:40.908
Carla, those are my friends you're calling idiots.

29:40.943 --> 29:42.936
And I'm your girlfriend they're calling a dyke.

29:43.475 --> 29:46.585
So you think long and hard about the shit your friends pull,

29:46.993 --> 29:52.391
the situations they get themselves in, the stupid shit that comes out of their mouth.

29:52.426 --> 29:54.395
And you think about me and you...

29:55.373 --> 29:57.442
alone in your bedroom.

30:00.392 --> 30:02.382
No clothes on.

30:13.068 --> 30:15.174
So, who you going to believe, huh?

30:15.981 --> 30:18.149
Not that bunch of idiots.

30:21.782 --> 30:23.090
Gorgeous.

30:23.579 --> 30:24.806
Smart.

30:35.092 --> 30:39.845
OK. I went down there to do the right thing and honor bones'

30:40.363 --> 30:42.755
memory. I had a drink in my hand, but I had not even taken

30:42.790 --> 30:45.148
one sip of it when this guy came up and started in with me,

30:45.183 --> 30:49.454
and he got under my skin, and that's... what happened.

30:54.399 --> 30:57.901
Just spent 31/2 hours cleaning this place,

31:00.486 --> 31:02.994
so you want an ash tray?

31:10.942 --> 31:14.529
Yeah. All right. I've still got a lot of stuff left to do,

31:14.564 --> 31:18.898
so if you came down here to stare a hole through me,

31:18.933 --> 31:23.575
you're going to be boring one right through my ass. All right?

31:31.485 --> 31:32.514
What?

31:32.549 --> 31:34.479
It's good practice.

31:34.904 --> 31:36.178
For what?

31:36.213 --> 31:38.189
Rehab.

31:38.489 --> 31:40.172
If you ever go.

31:41.515 --> 31:42.868
Listen...

31:43.620 --> 31:46.522
I don't give a shit how much you drink or what you drink

31:46.557 --> 31:48.423
or where you drink or why.

31:49.475 --> 31:52.154
But when your drinking starts appearing in the newspaper

31:52.854 --> 31:58.811
and on the television, then, you see,
then you got to answer for it.

32:00.016 --> 32:01.636
And you might want to take your head out of your ass for 5 seconds

32:01.671 --> 32:05.354
and look around for derek. Rember derek, huh?

32:05.389 --> 32:06.576
Yeah?
Your sponsee?

32:06.611 --> 32:08.994
Yeah?
Well, nobody's seen the guy for about a week,

32:09.029 --> 32:11.378
hasn't been to any meetings, not answering anybody's phone calls.

32:11.413 --> 32:13.285
You, you can drink yourself to death, OK?

32:13.320 --> 32:15.213
But you made a commitment to this kid.

32:15.831 --> 32:19.582
If anything happens to him, his blood will be on your hands.

32:26.633 --> 32:27.563
Hey, Chief.

32:27.598 --> 32:29.189
Nick. How are you?
Good.

32:31.024 --> 32:33.652
Hey, Tom. This place looks great.

32:33.687 --> 32:34.875
Yeah, I know.

32:34.910 --> 32:37.297
The cigarette butt.

32:37.332 --> 32:39.685
I got it. Hmm? What are you doing?

32:41.985 --> 32:43.099
What the...

32:45.414 --> 32:48.494
oh. I've been dying to use this thing. I bought it

32:48.529 --> 32:54.037
at a joke shop 2 years ago. They were right. It made a mess.

33:01.965 --> 33:05.272
Oh, boy. Yeah?

33:05.628 --> 33:09.045
Hey, Tom. It's derek, man.
How's it going?

33:09.080 --> 33:10.086
Hey, where are you?

33:10.121 --> 33:11.586
I'm down at the bar, man.

33:11.959 --> 33:14.194
You been drinking?
I took some shit.

33:14.229 --> 33:15.923
What... what did you take?

33:17.316 --> 33:21.742
What did you take?
Derek. Derek!

33:22.053 --> 33:23.495
I took some oxycontin.

33:23.972 --> 33:25.908
I'm going to close my eyes before I head out, man.

33:25.992 --> 33:28.297
Hey, listen. Don't go anywhere. I'm coming right down, OK?

33:28.332 --> 33:30.233
OK. Cool.

33:30.268 --> 33:32.135
Jesus Christ. Yeah.

33:38.168 --> 33:39.655
You all right?

33:40.274 --> 33:41.506
Yep.

33:42.676 --> 33:44.023
Did you drink?

33:44.691 --> 33:46.015
Nope.

33:46.050 --> 33:47.734
Did you take the pills?

33:49.853 --> 33:51.288
Nope.

33:51.615 --> 33:53.064
What's wrong?

33:53.099 --> 33:54.977
Hey, guys, he's here.

33:56.254 --> 33:57.482
What?

34:00.103 --> 34:01.555
You son of a bitch.

34:01.955 --> 34:03.689
Whoa. Whoa. Don't blame derek

34:04.295 --> 34:07.123
all right? We put him up to this.

34:12.891 --> 34:14.350
It's time, brother.

34:15.159 --> 34:18.400
OK. Listen...

34:18.435 --> 34:22.005
I had a drink in my hand...
we know, we know. Never a sip slipped your lips.

34:22.041 --> 34:24.706
I must have heard that a million goddamn times.

34:25.217 --> 34:27.406
I know a guy in 'nam who shot his own leg off.

34:27.440 --> 34:29.107
Oh, yeah? Was his first name plaxico?

34:29.141 --> 34:30.737
Had his gun in one hand

34:30.773 --> 34:33.327
while he was trying to open a bottle of Jack Daniels with his teeth.

34:33.362 --> 34:37.078
Guess who he blamed. Here's a hint... not the booze.

34:37.293 --> 34:39.261
Spills kill too, brother.

34:39.262 --> 34:41.364
Time to retire your number before you come up empty.

34:41.399 --> 34:43.672
Come on, Tom. Think about it.

34:44.187 --> 34:47.216
You know? Like, what is it, some good times, some laughs,

34:47.857 --> 34:51.804
in your case, a few new females along the way? But what is it really?

34:52.101 --> 34:57.575
It's a prison. It's a prison with 2 ways out... sobriety or the graveyard.

34:59.631 --> 35:03.852
We're all here because we love you, Tommy... with genuine love,

35:03.887 --> 35:06.021
not the liquid love that theodore

35:06.022 --> 35:08.492
thought he found in that bushmill's bottle.

35:08.994 --> 35:11.333
And if not for you, think about your children.

35:11.368 --> 35:13.672
What about katy and colleen? What are they feeling?

35:13.707 --> 35:15.638
The shame, the horror?

35:15.938 --> 35:21.870
She's right, cos. You know, I feel ashamed. I'm horrified.

35:21.905 --> 35:24.611
But this is... this is devastating.

35:25.860 --> 35:28.289
How long has it been since you had a drink, Eddie?

35:28.324 --> 35:30.272
8 months.

35:30.618 --> 35:32.060
Teddy?

35:32.095 --> 35:33.502
22 days.

35:33.537 --> 35:34.759
Mick?

35:34.794 --> 35:39.618
97 days and 12 hours.

35:40.019 --> 35:43.498
I have almost a year.
No thanks to you.

35:45.234 --> 35:47.504
See, Tom, we're all here for you.

35:47.539 --> 35:51.550
Most people only have one person to turn to, a sponsor.

35:51.585 --> 35:56.681
You have a room full of sponsors here. It's time to stop.

36:01.752 --> 36:04.643
OK. You guys win.

36:06.541 --> 36:08.198
Jesus.

36:09.243 --> 36:11.859
Enough with the looks. I get it.
Shit.

36:16.776 --> 36:20.285
I mean, it's just all magic.

36:22.646 --> 36:26.118
Just bottles full of magic wishes.

36:26.919 --> 36:29.077
I wish things were better.

36:30.081 --> 36:33.251
I wish I was better. You know, full glass of this,

36:33.286 --> 36:35.042
I'm Mr. Happy-go-lucky.

36:35.480 --> 36:39.335
Half bottle in, I got balls of steel.
I'm hell-bent for leather.

36:39.370 --> 36:42.815
I'm just humming. Big smile on my face,

36:43.747 --> 36:48.770
goddamn song in my goddamn heart.

36:49.944 --> 36:52.374
But you're right. It's not fair to the kids. I know I...

36:52.409 --> 36:58.068
I could make a good argument for this with them,

36:58.103 --> 37:01.811
too, 'cause a happy me is a happy them.

37:02.779 --> 37:05.355
You know? They don't have dad sitting at the kitchen table

37:05.869 --> 37:10.954
with his head up his ass wondering how long it was before

37:10.989 --> 37:16.039
their uncle Jimmy knew that he was going to be pulverized

37:16.074 --> 37:20.002
into a human goddamn pancake.

37:20.819 --> 37:25.226
'Cause, you know, happy dad wants to play scrabble or yahtzee

37:26.490 --> 37:31.318
or watchhigh school musical 35 goddamn times.

37:31.519 --> 37:32.788
But I get it.

37:33.216 --> 37:37.707
I got to stop sitting in these church basements with my

37:38.108 --> 37:39.920
cold cup

37:40.146 --> 37:45.430
of Gray coffee clenched in my white-knuckled claws.

37:46.899 --> 37:48.549
I just got to...

37:49.213 --> 37:51.768
relax, I guess, and learn to...

37:53.198 --> 37:55.898
embrace it and...

37:56.773 --> 38:00.831
accept it. That's the problem with magic.

38:02.448 --> 38:04.608
I hate goddamn magicians.

38:05.324 --> 38:09.681
David copperfield can kiss my bony Irish ass.

38:21.374 --> 38:23.276
Anyone else?

38:26.634 --> 38:28.225
What?

38:28.910 --> 38:30.981
Where are you going?

38:31.401 --> 38:33.526
Pussy. Who's up?

38:33.838 --> 38:35.255
Yeah, give me one.

38:35.290 --> 38:36.960
Eddie, what are you doing?

38:38.408 --> 38:40.253
Yeah. You know what? Me, too.

38:40.561 --> 38:41.493
Just a tall one.

38:41.528 --> 38:43.736
I thought we were supposed to be doing an intervention.

38:43.771 --> 38:45.944
We know, we know. I was holding up just fine

38:45.945 --> 38:48.661
until he brought up that thing about the claws.

38:49.721 --> 38:51.164
Damn right.

38:51.199 --> 38:52.874
You had me at balls of steel.

38:52.909 --> 38:53.867
Give me one.

38:53.902 --> 38:56.161
Yeah. Yeah. The balls was good. I like the balls bit.

38:56.196 --> 38:57.561
What about the shame thing?

38:57.596 --> 39:00.934
Well, I was ashamed, you know, because I've been drinking

39:00.969 --> 39:02.324
in secret this whole time.

39:02.359 --> 39:03.645
I must have... I must have spent,

39:03.680 --> 39:07.193
like, 2 grand on gum and mints in this past year alone.

39:07.521 --> 39:09.713
I mean, that cum gum stuff? Goddamn.

39:09.748 --> 39:13.871
I've been keeping those guys in business. You got any grey goose?

39:13.906 --> 39:16.437
Jesus. You're unbelievable, you know that?
What?

39:16.472 --> 39:19.269
So, did you even actually stay sober these last 3 years?

39:19.304 --> 39:20.776
4. no.

39:20.811 --> 39:23.121
Here we go. Get 'em up.

39:25.855 --> 39:27.922
What did you say about David copperfield?

39:28.487 --> 39:30.373
I said he sucks.

39:30.408 --> 39:32.260
Oh. That's what I thought.

39:34.526 --> 39:37.001
I've always hated that son of a bitch myself.

39:38.813 --> 39:40.402
Set me up.

39:41.444 --> 39:43.850
All right. It's funny.

39:44.073 --> 39:48.032
David copperfield was the thing that pushed you over the edge?

39:48.265 --> 39:51.329
Aw, you know. Make an elephant disappear.

39:52.976 --> 39:54.587
Watch me make this bar disappear.

39:54.622 --> 39:55.776
That's what I like to hear.

39:55.811 --> 39:59.568
Well, look at this, the weak bringing down the strong.

39:59.603 --> 40:01.607
I hope you're happy.

40:02.277 --> 40:06.080
I'm ecstatic. That AA coffee was giving me the runs.

40:06.517 --> 40:10.605
Mickey, you are the one person in this family I could count on.

40:10.869 --> 40:14.232
What? It was your idea to have an intervention in a bar.

40:15.688 --> 40:17.186
All right, guys.

40:19.495 --> 40:20.382
To Maggie.

40:20.417 --> 40:21.398
To prison.

40:21.433 --> 40:23.769
To cum gum.
To cum gum?

40:23.804 --> 40:25.758
No, see, there's that gum that's got the liquid center,

40:25.793 --> 40:27.776
so when you bite into it, it explodes in your mouth like...

40:27.811 --> 40:30.090
I must have missed something.
You know, it's like you're blowing somebody.

40:30.125 --> 40:32.409
Hey, I never blew anybody.
OK.

40:32.444 --> 40:37.112
I blew a guy once.
I really needed the ride.

40:38.527 --> 40:42.167
OK. The family that drinks together...

40:42.449 --> 40:44.575
sinks together.
Yeah.

40:52.638 --> 40:54.125
