WEBVTT

00:02.000 --> 00:03.240
CISCO: Previously on The Flash...

00:03.480 --> 00:04.527
If the answers that we need

00:04.720 --> 00:06.927
<i>to stop Samar and save you
are 'm the future,</i>

00:07.120 --> 00:08.360
<i>then that's where I need to go.</i>

00:08.560 --> 00:10.005
You're from before she dies, aren't you?

00:10.200 --> 00:12.328
You trapped Savitar in the Speed Force.

00:12.520 --> 00:14.249
- Just tell me how you did it.
-I had help.

00:14.440 --> 00:16.807
<i>Her name is Tracy Brand.
She made the Speed Force trap for me.</i>

00:17.000 --> 00:18.490
You're telling me my ideas
about the Speed Force...

00:18.680 --> 00:19.681
I'm right?

00:19.880 --> 00:22.087
In the future.
We need you to build this trap now.

00:22.800 --> 00:23.767
<i>CISCO: Caitlin's after Tracy.</i>

00:24.000 --> 00:25.240
<i>That means she's working with Savitar.</i>

00:25.440 --> 00:27.090
- So you talked to Cecile?
-Told her everything.

00:27.280 --> 00:28.327
<i>JOE". Told her I love her.</i>

00:28.520 --> 00:29.851
I told her that you were the Flash.

00:32.240 --> 00:34.242
<i>Like I told you from the beginning,</i>

00:34.440 --> 00:36.886
lam the Future Flash.

00:42.040 --> 00:44.247
It's like looking in a mirror.

00:44.760 --> 00:47.331
Well, not quite.

00:48.480 --> 00:50.767
You're not so scary without your armor.

00:51.320 --> 00:52.606
What can I say?

00:53.600 --> 00:54.761
I outgrew red.

00:55.040 --> 00:56.769
I know what you are.

00:57.440 --> 00:58.601
You're a Time Remnant.

00:59.040 --> 01:00.565
A temporal duplicate

01:01.520 --> 01:05.525
created when you run back in time
and meet yourself.

01:05.960 --> 01:09.169
<i>SAVYYAR: You brought a Remnant to life
last year to defeat Zoom.</i>

01:09.480 --> 01:13.166
<i>Your duplicate died
saving the multi-verse,</i>

01:13.520 --> 01:15.761
<i>and you continued your happy little life.</i>

01:15.960 --> 01:18.247
And it would've stayed that way.

01:18.440 --> 01:21.171
But then you decided to play God.

01:21.360 --> 01:24.921
You created Flashpoint
and changed everything.

01:25.320 --> 01:26.890
I went to the future.

01:27.120 --> 01:31.808
My future self told me that
he created Time Remnants to stop you,

01:32.240 --> 01:34.083
that you slaughtered them all.

01:34.320 --> 01:35.731
All but one.

01:35.920 --> 01:38.844
Me. I lived.

01:39.480 --> 01:43.371
But a funny thing happened when I did.

01:44.240 --> 01:48.325
You, Joe, Wally, Cisco,

01:49.080 --> 01:53.290
you all shunned me
because I wasn't the true Barry Allen.

01:53.520 --> 01:55.363
I was an aberration.

01:55.680 --> 01:57.967
<i>A disposable hero.</i>

01:58.520 --> 02:00.966
Future you failed to mention that,
didn't he?

02:01.760 --> 02:03.683
How did you become Savitar?

02:04.560 --> 02:07.643
I was broken and alone.

02:08.080 --> 02:10.162
I wanted the pain to end.

02:10.560 --> 02:13.166
<i>And that's when
I realized the truth, Barry.</i>

02:13.880 --> 02:15.882
God feels no pain.

02:16.160 --> 02:18.640
<i>All I had to do was become one.</i>

02:19.040 --> 02:21.441
And I only need two more things.

02:22.520 --> 02:27.242
For Iris to die, so that
you are driven so far into the dark

02:27.680 --> 02:29.409
that I can be born.

02:29.760 --> 02:31.125
And the other?

02:33.240 --> 02:36.005
It may sound ironic,
given who I'm talking to,

02:36.600 --> 02:38.602
but I'll keep that one to myself.

02:39.080 --> 02:40.969
What happens if I kill myself?

02:41.280 --> 02:44.090
If I die, then you'll never be created.

02:45.160 --> 02:46.889
Cause and effect's a tricky thing.

02:47.080 --> 02:48.650
Didn't work so well for Eddie, did it?

02:48.840 --> 02:52.242
Shot himself in the chest.
Thawne's still kicking around.

02:52.480 --> 02:55.245
See, that's the thing
about time travel, Barry.

02:55.480 --> 02:58.723
The more you do it,
the less the rules apply to you.

02:58.920 --> 03:01.969
But us having this conversation now,
we're changing the future.

03:02.360 --> 03:03.600
Are we?

03:04.760 --> 03:07.809
My ascendancy is nearing.

03:08.040 --> 03:10.725
When I have control of all of time,

03:11.200 --> 03:15.842
it will be you
who is abandoned and forgotten.

03:18.120 --> 03:19.121
(GRUNTS)

03:25.120 --> 03:26.690
You're gonna die right here!

03:26.880 --> 03:28.564
I forgot to tell you.

03:29.200 --> 03:31.441
My suit's cooler than yours.

03:33.320 --> 03:34.321
(GROANS)

03:35.920 --> 03:37.524
(GRUNTING)

03:52.480 --> 03:54.289
(YELLING)

03:57.640 --> 03:58.641
(GRUNTS)

04:11.640 --> 04:12.880
It's impossible.

04:13.080 --> 04:15.208
I don't understand.
How could Savitar be you?

04:15.440 --> 04:17.966
He's not me. Not really.

04:18.160 --> 04:20.640
He's all the worst parts of you.
It's like in Star Trek

04:20.839 --> 04:24.447
when the transporter
splits Kirk into Good Kirk and Bad Kirk.

04:25.200 --> 04:27.521
Please tell me you at least
have Star Trek on your Earth?

04:27.880 --> 04:29.803
- Voyager.
-I hate spinoffs.

04:30.400 --> 04:32.289
That explains
why Caitlin was willing to follow him.

04:32.480 --> 04:33.561
JULIAN: <i>He has</i> a <i>face that she trusts.</i>

04:33.760 --> 04:34.921
Half of one, anyway.

04:35.120 --> 04:38.886
So, when the Legends found that message
in the Waverider from old you saying,

04:39.080 --> 04:42.687
"Don't trust Barry Allen," he was talking
about Savitar Barry Allen.

04:43.160 --> 04:46.403
(CHUCKLES) It's all coming together
in the worst way.

04:46.640 --> 04:49.530
<i>You saw you made Samar'? How'?</i>

04:49.760 --> 04:50.761
Peep this.

04:51.920 --> 04:53.524
Four years from now,

04:53.720 --> 04:58.203
Future Flash creates
a Time Remnant to fight Savitar.

04:58.440 --> 05:02.650
But Savitar lets that Remnant live
so that it can later become Savitar.

05:04.000 --> 05:05.889
So, once Savitar is
imprisoned in the Speed Force,

05:06.080 --> 05:08.048
<i>this Remnant starts to go crazy,</i>

05:08.280 --> 05:13.684
<i>and he goes back "m “me to the past
and becomes Samar.</i>

05:13.880 --> 05:16.247
Creating the lie
that he was the first speedster,

05:16.440 --> 05:19.489
spreading the myth and recruiting acolytes
throughout the ages.

05:19.680 --> 05:20.841
That doesn't make any sense.

05:21.120 --> 05:24.044
Which came first,
Savitar or the Time Remnant?

05:24.240 --> 05:27.961
It's a closed loop. No beginning, no end.
It's just one endless cycle.

05:28.160 --> 05:30.128
Classic chicken-and-the-egg scenario,
I think, gang.

05:30.520 --> 05:33.000
A Time Remnant,
it's like a duplicate of you, right?

05:33.200 --> 05:35.282
So he has your feelings, your memories.

05:35.520 --> 05:37.329
<i>So why would he wanna hurt us?</i>

05:37.720 --> 05:39.085
Why would he wanna kill Iris?

05:40.560 --> 05:42.005
(SIGHS)

05:44.800 --> 05:47.485
H.R., how's Tracy coming
with the Speed Force trap?

05:47.680 --> 05:49.409
Good. Yeah, good. Slow.

05:49.600 --> 05:50.931
Get her to speed up, all right?

05:51.160 --> 05:52.605
H.R.: I'll do that now. Can do.

05:53.040 --> 05:55.202
If Savitar is a version of Barry
from the future,

05:55.400 --> 05:57.562
and he remembers everything Barry does,

05:58.160 --> 06:00.640
how are we ever gonna
come up with a plan to stop him?

06:13.280 --> 06:14.486
What was he like?

06:15.200 --> 06:16.531
Broken.

06:18.720 --> 06:19.721
IRIS WEST: You know,

06:21.000 --> 06:25.961
(SIGHS) all this time, I thought
that Savitar is this monster.

06:29.440 --> 06:33.923
It's hard to picture what might happen
and, it being you, that...

06:36.080 --> 06:38.048
I... I know it's not you, I...

06:39.760 --> 06:41.808
Part of him is.

06:44.240 --> 06:46.481
He said it was like looking in a mirror,
and he was right.

06:46.640 --> 06:48.608
But not just the way that he looked.
it was...

06:50.680 --> 06:54.685
it was his eyes,
the pain that was inside them.

06:55.320 --> 06:57.607
I've seen that in myself.

06:59.280 --> 07:03.968
When I think about
how my parents died so violently,

07:05.520 --> 07:08.091
sometimes, I wanna repay
that violence with more violence.

07:08.320 --> 07:12.325
I wanna make someone else
hurt as much as I do.

07:12.640 --> 07:14.369
But you don't ever do that.

07:16.000 --> 07:17.923
You're not him. You're a good person.

07:18.160 --> 07:20.606
No, I know, but it's in there, you know?
That's in me.

07:20.840 --> 07:23.286
That power, that pain.

07:23.480 --> 07:26.370
That's where Savitar comes from,
from loss.

07:28.000 --> 07:30.207
From losing you.

07:30.800 --> 07:32.609
You're not going to lose me.

07:33.360 --> 07:35.203
Do you hear me?

07:35.640 --> 07:37.722
And we are going to stop Savitar.

07:38.720 --> 07:40.722
You are not alone. He is.

07:41.360 --> 07:43.283
And he is not a god.

07:46.880 --> 07:49.565
Jay told me that we're not gods.

07:50.240 --> 07:51.844
He was wrong.

07:52.040 --> 07:56.170
We could be, any speedster,
and it wouldn't take much.

07:56.560 --> 07:59.803
When the love that we feel in our hearts
is drowned in anger,

08:00.720 --> 08:03.326
when the bad memories
outweigh the good ones...

08:05.320 --> 08:08.483
What am I gonna
have to become to stop him?

08:12.240 --> 08:14.402
Hey! on, bad time?

08:14.760 --> 08:15.921
No, man, what's up?

08:16.080 --> 08:18.401
I just came up with the best idea ever.

08:18.600 --> 08:20.887
Either that,
or it's the worst idea ever, but--

08:21.080 --> 08:23.082
-it's an idea.
-it's an idea!

08:24.320 --> 08:25.890
You wanna give me a perm?

08:26.080 --> 08:28.447
<i>It's not for</i> your hair, <i>Steel Magnolias.</i>

08:28.600 --> 08:29.840
It's for your brain, okay?

08:30.040 --> 08:33.010
I want to stop you
from making new memories.

08:33.240 --> 08:34.605
What are you talking about?

08:34.760 --> 08:37.764
Savitar knows everything we're gonna do
because he remembers doing it.

08:37.919 --> 08:38.921
He's a future Barry.

08:39.200 --> 08:43.409
So what if Barry can't remember
what we're doing now?

08:43.600 --> 08:45.250
You wanna mess with his brain?

08:45.440 --> 08:48.569
Just a little bit.
It's a minimal procedure.

08:48.760 --> 08:50.524
It'll still be the same Barry
you know and love,

08:50.720 --> 08:53.087
except he just won't be able
to retain new information.

08:53.280 --> 08:55.567
There's two types of memory, Allen,
short-term and long-term.

08:55.800 --> 08:57.802
- Long-term is for your--
-Okay! Julian, this is... Stop.

08:57.960 --> 09:00.247
This is my presentation.
I'm the expert here.

09:00.440 --> 09:02.442
This is the part of your brain
that retains new information

09:02.720 --> 09:04.643
before sending it to the cortex
to be stored forever,

09:04.880 --> 09:09.488
so what if we block that chain
with a magnetic disruption.

09:09.720 --> 09:11.324
So Savitar won't be able to remember

09:11.480 --> 09:13.289
whatever strategy
we come up with to defeat him.

09:13.720 --> 09:15.802
Which means
he can't be two steps ahead of us anymore.

09:16.040 --> 09:18.281
With any luck,
we'll actually put him one step behind.

09:18.480 --> 09:20.926
Beautiful. Cause and effect.

09:21.320 --> 09:22.970
Barry, what do you think?

09:26.640 --> 09:28.165
Let's do it.

09:28.440 --> 09:32.490
Wait. Wasn't Caitlin
the expert on brains around here?

09:32.640 --> 09:36.964
She was. But this is something
we'll have to do without her.

09:37.440 --> 09:39.010
I trust you.

09:40.840 --> 09:41.966
You won't feel a thing.

09:42.160 --> 09:44.322
Okay. Let's get this show on the road.

09:44.760 --> 09:48.526
The disrupter is attached
to your hippocampus, so we're sure.

09:48.760 --> 09:50.250
Okay, ready for zapping.

09:50.480 --> 09:51.845
Can we not call it "Zapping"?

09:52.640 --> 09:57.089
Ready to activate in three, two, one.

10:01.280 --> 10:03.442
- Sweet dreams, my beautiful boy.
- HENRY: Way to <i>go,</i> slugger.

10:03.640 --> 10:04.607
<i>DR. WELLS". Run, Barry! Run!</i>

10:04.800 --> 10:06.962
<i>JOE: I have watched you
be in love with Iris.</i>

10:07.160 --> 10:08.844
<i>IRIS</i> WEST: <i>Maybe,
we were meant to be together.</i>

10:10.680 --> 10:11.886
Okay, that should do it.

10:12.160 --> 10:13.491
All right.

10:14.320 --> 10:16.607
Right. (CLEARS THROAT)
How do you feel?

10:17.840 --> 10:19.126
I feel fine.

10:19.360 --> 10:20.964
-(CHUCKLES)
-You see? He feels fine.

10:23.440 --> 10:24.566
Barry?

10:25.720 --> 10:27.210
Barry?

10:28.120 --> 10:29.121
JULIAN: Barry?

10:30.000 --> 10:31.161
Who's Barry?

10:32.120 --> 10:33.201
Not fine.

10:34.560 --> 10:36.050
Who are all of you?

10:44.520 --> 10:47.729
What's going on?
Seriously, who are you guys?

10:47.880 --> 10:49.245
- Okay, Barry, stay calm--
-Who's Barry?

10:49.400 --> 10:51.209
- Cisco!
-Slight miscalculation.

10:51.400 --> 10:52.401
"Slight" wouldn't be a word I'd use.

10:52.640 --> 10:55.405
Where the hell am I?
Is this a dentist office?

10:55.560 --> 10:57.244
No, no, this is S.T.A.R. Labs.

10:57.400 --> 10:59.926
S.T.A.R. Labs? A laboratory?

11:00.080 --> 11:02.481
A laboratory? What do you...
Were you guys experimenting on me?

11:02.720 --> 11:06.008
No one is... Well, yes.
Technically, yes, but it was consensual.

11:06.200 --> 11:07.770
- You were? You...
-Yes.

11:07.920 --> 11:09.081
(BREATHING HEAVILY)
Why can't I remember anything?

11:09.320 --> 11:10.526
Why can't I remember my name?

11:10.720 --> 11:11.881
Your name is Barry.

11:12.080 --> 11:13.366
My name is not Barry.

11:13.560 --> 11:16.450
I don't know what my name is,
but my name's "Bartholomew Henry Allen."

11:17.840 --> 11:20.081
- That's not a good name.
-Look, Barry--

11:20.280 --> 11:22.203
Are you sure I don't go by "Bart"? Can...

11:22.400 --> 11:25.131
"Bart" feels more natural to me.
Can we go with "Bart"?

11:25.280 --> 11:26.361
-"Bart" is kind of cool.
-Okay.

11:26.560 --> 11:27.925
<i>"Wally!
- Okay_</i>

11:28.120 --> 11:29.246
Hey, let’s just get you back in the chair.

11:29.440 --> 11:30.601
No! No, no, no.

11:30.760 --> 11:32.444
- I'm not getting in the chair.
-Let's just get you--

11:32.680 --> 11:34.125
<i>BARRY: No, how do I know
you didn't kidnap me here</i>

11:34.280 --> 11:36.248
to do some weird brain surgery on me?

11:36.440 --> 11:38.920
Or maybe you're like those criminals
who trick people into hotel rooms

11:39.120 --> 11:41.248
so they can steal their kidneys.
Do I still have my kidneys?

11:41.440 --> 11:42.441
We don't want your kidneys!

11:42.600 --> 11:45.126
Okay, Barry, look at these photographs.

11:46.240 --> 11:49.210
We're your friends, your family.

11:51.640 --> 11:53.404
I just wanna help you, okay?

12:00.920 --> 12:02.410
That's a nice ring.

12:02.960 --> 12:04.291
<i>BARRY". Who's the lucky guy?</i>

12:07.160 --> 12:08.730
You are, Barry.

12:10.320 --> 12:13.324
Look, I know you're scared, okay?
You can trust us.

12:15.320 --> 12:17.721
- Cisco, a minute?
-Yes, sir.

12:18.240 --> 12:19.321
I'm gonna be right back, okay?

12:20.280 --> 12:21.486
Wally, stay with him, okay?

12:21.960 --> 12:23.166
Me?

12:25.240 --> 12:27.004
So how do we know each other?

12:27.760 --> 12:29.603
Oh, uh, I'm your brother.

12:34.840 --> 12:38.765
There is no sign
of any permanent structural damage.

12:38.960 --> 12:41.122
Then why can't he remember anything?

12:42.360 --> 12:43.521
Juhan?

12:43.680 --> 12:46.843
He appears to be suffering from some sort
of psychogenic retrograde amnesia.

12:47.120 --> 12:48.167
Amnesia.

12:48.360 --> 12:51.284
What if we didn't account
for Barry's increased neural velocity?

12:51.480 --> 12:52.686
Due to his super speed.

12:52.840 --> 12:55.161
Wait. Do we think he knows he's the Flash?

12:55.360 --> 12:56.691
<i>JOE". That he has super speed?</i>

12:57.680 --> 12:59.170
Hey Barry, catch.

13:02.200 --> 13:03.850
Sorry.

13:04.640 --> 13:06.210
- Oh, my Lord!
-He's, like, god-awful.

13:06.440 --> 13:09.046
- He's pathetic.
-Can we flip a switch, undo it?

13:09.200 --> 13:13.000
Okay, we are not flipping any more
switches until we figure this thing out.

13:13.320 --> 13:14.810
(CELLPHONE VIBRATING)

13:15.200 --> 13:16.884
It's Cecile. Hey, babe.

13:17.680 --> 13:20.968
An emergency? All right, bye.

13:22.320 --> 13:25.005
Okay, Cecile needs Barry at C.C.P.D.,
like, right now.

13:25.240 --> 13:26.241
She says it's urgent.

13:26.400 --> 13:28.368
He can't possibly
go out in that condition.

13:28.560 --> 13:32.485
Okay, um, my dad and I
will take Barry to Cecile.

13:32.680 --> 13:35.524
You and Cisco figure out a way
to get Barry's memory back,

13:35.720 --> 13:37.404
<i>and fast, yeah?</i>

13:38.240 --> 13:41.403
Okay. Okay.

13:42.360 --> 13:43.771
TRACY: You don't wanna work?

13:44.360 --> 13:45.930
Well, then I don't need you!

13:48.000 --> 13:52.050
Um, am I to infer, then,
that you've hit a little speed bump

13:52.240 --> 13:55.403
in your quest to build a device
to trap Savitar in the Speed Force? The--

13:55.600 --> 13:57.762
Accelerated matter
micro generator projectile?

13:58.000 --> 13:59.764
No, I know.
it doesn't exactly roll off the tongue.

13:59.920 --> 14:04.721
No, it doesn't. How about
we call this fancy device of yours--

14:04.920 --> 14:06.285
- No, you probably shouldn't--
-Call it the--

14:06.440 --> 14:07.441
Speed Force cannon!

14:07.640 --> 14:09.483
Speed Force bazooka!

14:09.720 --> 14:10.801
Speed Force gun!

14:11.480 --> 14:13.926
- Speed Force bazooka's much better. Yeah.
-Speed Force bazooka's better.

14:14.120 --> 14:16.327
But if the Speed Force bazooka
doesn't start working soon,

14:16.560 --> 14:18.722
we're gonna have to start
calling it the Speed Force Epic Fail.

14:18.960 --> 14:19.961
Why, what's the problem?

14:20.120 --> 14:22.851
Okay, the accelerometer, it sucks
a hell of a lot of air watts,

14:23.080 --> 14:25.128
-which <i>is</i> measured--
- All right, stop talking science!

14:25.280 --> 14:28.807
You need to take a step back
from the Speed Force bazooka.

14:28.960 --> 14:30.803
- But there's not time.
-There's always time!

14:31.280 --> 14:33.965
-(SIGHS)
-Because sometimes to move forward,

14:34.120 --> 14:35.963
you have to take a step back.

14:36.120 --> 14:38.327
Step back. You see?

14:38.600 --> 14:40.250
Yes, and shake a little those shoulders.

14:40.480 --> 14:42.244
Shake a little those shoulders.
You know, I feel like...

14:42.480 --> 14:45.006
Oh my gosh, the tension in your shoulders!

14:45.680 --> 14:47.170
Think of something that calms you.

14:48.360 --> 14:52.160
- Coffee.
-Oh, yes!

14:52.960 --> 14:53.961
But not just any coffee.

14:54.160 --> 14:56.447
Piping hot Indonesian dark-roast
with raspberry and coriander--

14:56.640 --> 14:58.290
Raspberry and coriander...

15:00.800 --> 15:05.044
I have never met another person who uses
copious amounts of caffeine to chill out.

15:05.280 --> 15:07.601
I've never met another person, either.

15:16.560 --> 15:20.360
(STAMMERS) I'm relaxed. Are you relaxed?

15:20.640 --> 15:21.641
- Mmm-hmm.
-Mmm-hmm.

15:21.840 --> 15:24.684
- You, uh... And I'll...
-Yeah.

15:24.880 --> 15:27.008
Okay. I mean... Okay.

15:27.160 --> 15:28.161
TRACY: Yeah.

15:28.560 --> 15:29.561
(GASPS)

15:32.360 --> 15:33.361
<i>CECILE: Good morning, people.</i>

15:33.560 --> 15:35.847
Hi, I'm Barry Allen. You can call me Bart.

15:36.080 --> 15:37.320
- Okay.
-(CHUCKLES)

15:37.520 --> 15:39.648
So you said there was an emergency.
Where is the fire?

15:39.840 --> 15:42.411
Ah, it's funny you should
put it like that. Lucious Coolidge.

15:42.640 --> 15:43.641
- Who?
-Heat Monger.

15:43.880 --> 15:47.885
The worst arsonist Central City's seen
since Mick Rory went off the grid.

15:48.760 --> 15:50.762
That is, until Flash here stopped him.

15:51.400 --> 15:55.041
- What's Flash?
-(STAMMERS) So what is the problem?

15:55.240 --> 15:57.083
Judge Hankerson,
he's got an opening in his docket,

15:57.320 --> 16:00.369
so he moved Coolidge's probable-cause
hearing up to this afternoon.

16:00.600 --> 16:01.886
Barry was the CSI on the case,

16:02.080 --> 16:05.448
so I need him to testify
in order to hold Coolidge over for trial.

16:05.760 --> 16:08.604
Uh, yeah, no, Barry can't do that.

16:08.920 --> 16:10.604
Why not?

16:12.680 --> 16:13.761
Uh...

16:14.720 --> 16:16.245
What do you mean he has amnesia?

16:16.600 --> 16:17.726
Barr, what's her name?

16:18.120 --> 16:20.122
Uh... Felicia?

16:21.840 --> 16:22.762
Oh my God.

16:23.040 --> 16:25.930
(STAMMERS) Is this, like, a Flash thing?

16:26.120 --> 16:27.724
Was he battling a supervillain who used

16:27.960 --> 16:29.928
-his evil powers to steal Barry's memory?
-(CHUCKLES)

16:30.600 --> 16:34.810
No, we sort of accidentally
did this to him ourselves.

16:35.040 --> 16:36.041
Why?

16:36.240 --> 16:39.403
That's doesn't matter. What does matter
is you stalling that judge.

16:39.640 --> 16:41.881
Barry is in no condition
to testify in court.

16:42.080 --> 16:45.448
Joe, if Barry can't testify,
Coolidge walks.

16:45.640 --> 16:47.051
And then God help us all.

16:47.240 --> 16:48.924
Okay, we'll figure out something.

16:49.080 --> 16:50.081
Please do.

16:52.440 --> 16:53.930
It was nice meeting you.

16:54.320 --> 16:57.483
Oh, yeah, you, too, Bart.

17:01.960 --> 17:04.724
I got some friends down at the courthouse.
I'm gonna go down there

17:04.960 --> 17:07.930
and see if we can delay
this whole Coolidge situation, all right?

17:16.119 --> 17:17.281
I'm sorry.

17:18.000 --> 17:19.286
For what?

17:19.960 --> 17:22.166
I don't know.
it just seems like everybody's upset,

17:22.400 --> 17:24.128
and it feels like it's my fault.

17:24.599 --> 17:26.489
No, no, not at all.

17:27.480 --> 17:30.006
Look, we just want you to get back
to normal. That's it, okay?

17:31.320 --> 17:34.483
Well, I would,
if I could remember what normal is.

17:34.960 --> 17:37.281
I mean, what have you and I
been doing lately?

17:37.480 --> 17:39.369
Are we planning the wedding?

17:39.920 --> 17:41.649
Like, have we sent out wedding invitations

17:41.800 --> 17:44.007
or picked a honeymoon destination or...

17:44.200 --> 17:46.521
Am I a warm-weather guy
or a cold-weather guy?

17:49.040 --> 17:51.691
Actually, we've been
a little busy lately, so...

17:53.600 --> 17:55.170
With what?

17:57.480 --> 18:00.131
Um, nothing that you need
to worry about, okay?

18:01.360 --> 18:02.486
Okay. You know what's weird?

18:02.680 --> 18:04.682
I know we just ate,
but I'm already feeling hungry.

18:04.880 --> 18:06.041
Yeah, let's get some food in you.

18:06.280 --> 18:07.361
- All right.
-Okay.

18:08.840 --> 18:10.490
What's that saying?

18:11.120 --> 18:14.044
"Man plans, and God laughs"?

18:14.640 --> 18:15.687
Well, men are planning,

18:15.880 --> 18:18.008
and what's the God of Speed doing?

18:19.200 --> 18:22.409
Kneeling. Brooding time is over.

18:22.640 --> 18:25.644
You revealed yourself. Now what?

18:25.840 --> 18:28.844
Any idea what to do
with Flash and friends?

18:29.080 --> 18:32.368
Because we are getting
pretty close to your big becoming,

18:32.560 --> 18:36.042
and if we don't take them down,
neither one of us gets what we want.

the nerd thing going on, huh?

we were best friends in high school.

19:21.440 --> 19:22.407
Yeah, we were.

19:22.640 --> 19:24.369
Why didn't you give me some advice,
help me out?

19:24.600 --> 19:26.602
Oh, believe me, okay, I tried.

19:26.800 --> 19:27.881
- Really? You did?
-Yes.

that you did not.

even I can see how wrong that look was.

the weight of the world on your shoulders.

brooding all the time before?

23:22.160 --> 23:24.162
Yes, I can... I can continue.

Ms. Horton,
if Mr. Allen is unable to elaborate,

23:53.840 --> 23:56.241
I'll have no choice but to dismiss.

- Mr. <i>Allen?</i>

24:12.280 --> 24:14.442
Marvelous. They let the pyro go.

24:14.720 --> 24:16.449
- What went wrong?
-Everything.

24:16.720 --> 24:18.768
Barry's memory loss
is starting to become a problem.

24:19.240 --> 24:21.971
It sure is. For more than just him.

24:24.040 --> 24:25.246
I don't have my speed.

24:25.560 --> 24:27.881
Not anymore, and I know why.

24:28.040 --> 24:32.807
If you wanna fix this and help Barry,
you are gonna do exactly as I say.

24:37.280 --> 24:40.887
And now this Heat Monger's gonna go free
because of me, and I feel awful.

24:41.080 --> 24:42.411
Barry, it's not your fault.

24:42.560 --> 24:44.961
Well, it's just that
now there's a bad guy on the streets,

24:45.160 --> 24:46.924
and I can't do anything about it.

24:47.920 --> 24:48.921

24:49.840 --> 24:50.966
What?

24:51.160 --> 24:52.764
Is that not something
I would've said before?

24:52.920 --> 24:55.764
That is exactly something
you would've said before.

24:55.920 --> 25:00.005
There is just something about you
that always wants to help.

25:03.680 --> 25:05.250
This is our place?

25:06.240 --> 25:08.527

25:10.000 --> 25:11.001
Wow!

25:11.440 --> 25:12.601
You have great taste.

25:12.800 --> 25:15.280
Uh, actually, this is all you.

25:15.440 --> 25:18.364
- I find that hard to believe.
-(CHUCKLES)

25:19.640 --> 25:20.641
Is that me?

25:20.840 --> 25:21.921
IRIS WEST: Yeah.

25:24.960 --> 25:26.450
Who are these people?

25:27.440 --> 25:29.363
They're your parents.

25:30.040 --> 25:33.522
You don't remember anything
about what happened?

25:34.120 --> 25:35.963
Why, did something bad happen?

25:37.960 --> 25:39.200
They died.

25:39.840 --> 25:42.969
It was unexpected,
but they died peacefully.

25:43.520 --> 25:46.000
<i>That's why you came
to live with Joe and me.</i>

25:49.000 --> 25:50.001
And that's when we met?

25:50.200 --> 25:53.329
Uh, no, actually,
we were friends before then.

25:53.520 --> 25:55.522
I remember the first time that I saw you.

25:55.720 --> 25:58.690
You were the happiest boy
that I'd ever met.

25:59.640 --> 26:01.881
I have a feeling
that's because you entered my life.

26:10.880 --> 26:12.166
It's okay.

26:23.880 --> 26:25.166
What the...

26:35.920 --> 26:37.445
Barry! Are you okay?

26:37.680 --> 26:38.920
Whatjust happened to me?

26:46.080 --> 26:47.684
These powers are so cool!

26:47.840 --> 26:50.730
I can literally feel electricity
coursing through my body.

26:50.960 --> 26:52.883
I mean, is it always like this?
This is amazing!

26:54.600 --> 26:56.364
We just walked into a buzzkill.
(CLEARS THROAT)

26:56.520 --> 26:59.046
My presence usually dampens the mood.

26:59.200 --> 27:01.043
- Joe, don't!
-You fire, I'll fire.

27:01.200 --> 27:03.248
- What the hell is she doing here?
-WALLY: She wants to help.

27:03.440 --> 27:04.601
-"Help"?
-With what?

27:04.800 --> 27:06.450
With the fact that I lost my powers.

27:08.240 --> 27:10.925
Barry, why don't you give us a minute?

27:11.120 --> 27:12.963
Sure. Yeah. Are you, like, a supervillain?

27:14.160 --> 27:16.208
Just asking. Okay.

27:17.280 --> 27:18.486
How did this happen?

27:18.920 --> 27:20.331
You got rid of Barry's memories.

27:20.840 --> 27:22.922
What Barry remembers, Savitar remembers.

27:23.160 --> 27:24.764
So Savitar's lost his memories, too?

27:24.960 --> 27:26.485
Savitar loses his memory,

27:26.680 --> 27:28.808
he doesn't go along
with the plan to give Wally powers.

27:29.040 --> 27:30.280
Cause and effect.

27:30.480 --> 27:33.927
But if you let me help you figure out
how to get Barry's memories back,

27:34.120 --> 27:35.610
everything goes back to the way it was.

27:35.840 --> 27:38.571
- Kid Flash runs again.
-And Savitar survives.

27:38.800 --> 27:40.086
And Iris dies.

27:40.320 --> 27:42.049
Life's full Of difficult choices.

27:42.240 --> 27:43.241
Or it isn't.

27:43.520 --> 27:45.841
If Savitar gets his memory back,
what's in it for you?

27:46.320 --> 27:48.004
That's my business.

27:48.280 --> 27:50.681
FROST: You think
that Barry can become the Flash?

27:51.000 --> 27:53.128
Yeah, he can learn.

27:53.320 --> 27:55.288
I still know how to do everything.
I can teach him.

27:55.680 --> 27:58.843
Okay.
Maybe this is how you defeat Savitar.

27:59.320 --> 28:02.688
<i>FROST: But there's still
a lot of villains in this city,</i>

28:03.040 --> 28:04.849
and no Flashes to protect it.

28:06.200 --> 28:08.601
Is that really a chance
you're willing to take?

28:11.680 --> 28:13.489
- Hi! I'm still here.
-(GASPS)

28:13.840 --> 28:16.411
- There you are.
-Because when you left, I stayed.

28:16.680 --> 28:19.411
We've got to talk
about the elephant in the room.

28:19.600 --> 28:21.728
But you know what? (STAMMERS)
I have a job to do.

28:21.920 --> 28:23.046
We have to build that device!

28:23.800 --> 28:27.441
We have got to focus on the task at hand.
Do you understand what I'm saying?

28:27.680 --> 28:28.647
I totally understand.

28:28.840 --> 28:34.051
From here on out, whenever I look
into your azure eyes flecked with gray

28:34.240 --> 28:38.325
like a summer rainstorm
coming to kiss my lips,

28:38.880 --> 28:41.121
the only thing I'm gonna be thinking about

28:41.400 --> 28:46.406
is how I can best inspire
that beautiful, sexy brain.

28:52.880 --> 28:54.086
Sparks.

28:54.680 --> 28:55.841
Sparks.

28:56.080 --> 28:57.241
You felt them, too?

28:57.520 --> 28:58.521
- No.
-No?

28:58.720 --> 29:00.370
- No, I mean, yes, obviously.
-Okay.

29:00.560 --> 29:03.609
Sparks!
Jumping between two parallel wires.

29:03.920 --> 29:05.763

29:06.560 --> 29:08.085
I guess my work here is done.

29:10.600 --> 29:13.171
You should've never tried this
without Caitlin.

29:14.440 --> 29:16.966
Well, we didn't really have
much of a choice, now did we?

29:17.160 --> 29:19.128
Also, don't refer to yourself
in the third person.

29:19.360 --> 29:21.203
<i>CISCO: It's Caitlin. It's you.
It's the same person.</i>

29:21.440 --> 29:22.680

29:31.880 --> 29:32.881
What?

29:33.600 --> 29:35.045
Nothing.

29:37.400 --> 29:40.085
Oh, golly! Look at us,

29:40.560 --> 29:43.291
<i>just three musketeers working</i> away.

29:44.400 --> 29:46.402
Just like old times, huh?

29:46.880 --> 29:48.484
Hey, Julian, Caitlin ever tell you
about our time

29:48.720 --> 29:50.210
working on the particle accelerator
with Ronnie?

29:50.400 --> 29:51.925
JULIAN: No. No, she <i>did</i> not.

29:52.120 --> 29:54.361
There was this one time,
we had this very strict deadline,

29:54.600 --> 29:57.763
and Dr. Wells was super hard on us,
all of us, even Hartley.

29:57.960 --> 29:59.121
Who's Hartley?

29:59.400 --> 30:01.687
Oh, he was this guy we used to work with.
Such a dick.

30:01.880 --> 30:04.486
You actually reminded me a lot of him
when you first came on board.

30:04.680 --> 30:07.968
Anyway, so we were working
on the iridium plating for the, um...

30:08.320 --> 30:10.163
What was it called, again?

30:11.000 --> 30:13.685
The syncotron, that's what it was.

30:13.880 --> 30:16.531
So, anyway, we were struggling,
and we were burning the midnight oil,

30:16.720 --> 30:21.282
and we could not get the dubnium capacitor
to hold a single charge.

30:21.480 --> 30:24.324
And so, all of a sudden,
Ronnie just loses all his chill.

30:24.520 --> 30:27.091
<i>CISCO: He turns beet red,
and he starts yelling at the thing,</i>

30:27.280 --> 30:30.045
like, "Come on you dumb-nium capacitor"--

30:30.240 --> 30:31.651
"Take charge."

30:31.920 --> 30:34.810
Yes! (LAUGHS) Yes.

30:35.680 --> 30:36.886
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

30:39.480 --> 30:42.563
I think about
all the memories I cherish most,

30:44.160 --> 30:45.969
and you're in every single one
of them, Caitlin.

30:52.680 --> 30:54.170
Let's figure this out.

30:54.600 --> 30:56.409
I don't wanna be here
any longer than I have to.

30:58.640 --> 31:00.005
Suit yourself.

31:03.120 --> 31:06.010
Okay! Guys, I still can't believe
I have these powers.

31:06.200 --> 31:08.328
They're amazing. I mean...

31:08.520 --> 31:10.045

What... All right, well,
is it cool if I run some more?

31:14.960 --> 31:16.371
- Have at it.
-All right.

31:20.360 --> 31:21.407
Mmm.

31:21.800 --> 31:23.882
I haven't seen him
this happy in a long time.

31:24.920 --> 31:25.967
Try ever.

31:26.400 --> 31:28.004
It's the first time
he hasn't been weighed down

31:28.240 --> 31:30.208
by the tragedies of his past, you know?

31:30.720 --> 31:33.769
First time he's actually
been free of them.

31:36.160 --> 31:38.162
You don't want
his memory restored, do you?

31:40.240 --> 31:41.241
Dad, I...

31:42.080 --> 31:44.287
I can't say
that seeing him happy and light

31:44.480 --> 31:46.050
isn't something that I have wished for him

31:46.240 --> 31:49.005
because, yeah, it is.

31:49.200 --> 31:52.249
Sweetheart, I wish that for him, too,

31:52.440 --> 31:53.487
but you didn't
fall in love with the Flash.

31:53.720 --> 31:54.881
You fell in love with Barry Allen.

31:55.080 --> 31:57.651
Dad, I know this is
a different version of him,

31:59.160 --> 32:00.571
but he's still Barry.

32:00.760 --> 32:01.966
No, he's not, honey.

32:02.920 --> 32:04.729
Look, until yesterday,

32:04.920 --> 32:08.288
Barry had 28 years of experiences
to define him.

32:08.480 --> 32:10.847
And some of those memories were bad,
but some were good, too.

32:11.280 --> 32:15.330
But without those memories,
the Barry Allen we know and love is gone.

32:15.800 --> 32:17.131
(BARRY CHEERING)

32:17.680 --> 32:18.886
I don't know, Dad.

32:20.640 --> 32:24.964
You know, part of me can't help but think
that this is some sort of gift, you know?

32:25.160 --> 32:27.766
That this is the life
that he was supposed to have.

32:28.160 --> 32:30.322
Maybe this city doesn't need the Flash.

34:18.520 --> 34:20.726
and, theoretically,
it should jolt his memories.

34:20.920 --> 34:22.842
You want to electroshock his brain?

34:23.080 --> 34:24.161
Won't that fry it even more?

34:24.360 --> 34:26.123
If we don't do that,
all the people are gonna die.

34:28.920 --> 34:30.045
Life's a game of chance.

34:31.280 --> 34:35.444
Okay, Barry, you're gonna feel something.
It might hurt, might sting, might suck.

34:35.639 --> 34:36.641
Wait. What?

34:37.000 --> 34:38.967
Probably all three. Okay, here we go!

34:39.199 --> 34:40.531
(SCREAMING)

34:41.760 --> 34:43.444
(FLASH GROANING)

34:47.320 --> 34:48.321
Barry?

34:48.800 --> 34:50.040
(GROANING)

34:50.719 --> 34:51.801
Barry?

34:52.360 --> 34:54.089
Uh, yeah, I still don't remember.

34:54.760 --> 34:56.364
Why didn't that work?
That was supposed to work.

34:56.560 --> 34:59.723
We kick-started his temporal lobe.
Now he just needs to access it.

35:00.240 --> 35:02.288
Gas is in the tank.
We just need to turn on the ignition.

35:02.640 --> 35:04.449
We need a visceral memory
to spark his brain.

35:06.800 --> 35:09.041
-(SIREN BLARING)
-Okay.

35:10.240 --> 35:11.241
Okay.

35:13.560 --> 35:16.370
Barry, I need you to remember.

35:16.960 --> 35:19.964
- I can't!
-Yes. Yes, you can, okay?

35:20.160 --> 35:21.924
<i>IRIS WEST: Okay, listen to me.</i>

35:22.320 --> 35:25.130
The night that your morn died,
I didn't wanna tell you how,

35:25.320 --> 35:26.890
but she didn't die peacefully.

35:27.840 --> 35:30.161
- IRIS WEST: She was murdered.
-What?

35:30.640 --> 35:32.642
And you came to live with us.

35:33.720 --> 35:37.645
<i>My dad brought you inside,
and you were in shock.</i>

35:37.840 --> 35:39.763
<i>You weren't even crying.</i>

35:40.840 --> 35:46.085
<i>And later that night, a sound woke me,
and I crawled out of my bed,</i>

35:46.280 --> 35:50.330
and I realized that
the sound was coming from downstairs.

35:51.200 --> 35:56.081
<i>I peered over the banister,
and I found you crying alone.</i>

35:57.000 --> 35:58.843
And I knew I had to go to you.

35:59.440 --> 36:03.809
I sat next to you,
and you put your head in my lap,

36:04.000 --> 36:06.241
<i>and I held you while you cried.</i>

36:06.480 --> 36:09.450
And I didn't know it then,
but now, looking back,

36:09.680 --> 36:12.650
I realize that
that was the night that we fell in love.

36:13.320 --> 36:17.928
<i>That was the night that we realized
how much we needed each other.</i>

36:19.200 --> 36:24.969
And, look, I so wish
that I could take your dark memories away.

36:25.200 --> 36:30.366
I wish that I could make all of that
pain go away, but I can't, okay?

36:30.560 --> 36:32.449
<i>But what I do know, what I know,</i>

36:33.520 --> 36:35.090
is that for every bad memory,

36:35.280 --> 36:38.409
there is a good one
that will get you through it.

36:44.600 --> 36:45.965
<i>DR. WELLS". Run, Barry! Run!</i>

36:46.760 --> 36:47.761
(GASPS)

36:56.720 --> 36:57.767
Barry?

36:59.120 --> 37:00.121
I remember.

37:00.560 --> 37:01.891
SAVITAR: I remember.

37:02.280 --> 37:03.645
I remember everything.

37:03.840 --> 37:05.604
I remember everything.

37:07.120 --> 37:08.610
Now, for this fire.

37:13.120 --> 37:15.726
I don't think
I can put this fire out alone!

37:16.440 --> 37:17.965
You don't have to.

37:34.800 --> 37:36.131
- Yes!
-(CHUCKLES)

37:37.640 --> 37:38.641
(GRUNTS)

37:42.720 --> 37:45.246
Looks like you remembered
how to save the day.

37:45.480 --> 37:47.050
Like riding a bike.

37:51.280 --> 37:52.770
<i>JOE: Your mother's maiden name?
BARRY". Thompson.</i>

37:52.960 --> 37:55.691
CODIS is an acronym for what?

37:56.320 --> 37:58.687
- Combined DNA Index System.
-(CHUCKLES)

38:00.120 --> 38:04.011
Okay, in the third grade,
you renamed the class hamster to?

38:05.160 --> 38:07.845
- Alexander Ham Bell.
-(LAUGHTER)

38:08.160 --> 38:09.286
I was eight years old.

38:09.480 --> 38:10.891
So you got your memories back.

38:11.080 --> 38:15.244
Now we can all focus our attention
on stopping Savitar.

38:15.800 --> 38:16.801
(FROST SCOFFS)

38:17.360 --> 38:19.010
Good luck with that.

38:21.560 --> 38:23.642
Please tell me we're not gonna
just let her walk out of here.

38:27.600 --> 38:28.681
Now you wanna fight?

38:28.920 --> 38:30.126
We don't wanna fight you.

38:30.360 --> 38:32.089
Can't really avoid that, now can we?

38:32.480 --> 38:34.448
Yeah, we can. You can stay here with us.

38:34.680 --> 38:36.967
<i>BARRY". We're your friends, your family.</i>

38:38.840 --> 38:40.649
Caitlin, I can fix you.

38:41.600 --> 38:42.601
You already tried.

38:42.920 --> 38:44.001
Well, then I'll try harder.

38:44.200 --> 38:47.488
I don't care what it takes.
I don't care what I have to do.

38:47.720 --> 38:50.883
I swear to you, I will find you a cure.

38:54.240 --> 38:55.890
Caitlin, I love you.

38:58.320 --> 38:59.845
I don't love you, Julian.

39:01.800 --> 39:02.961
I never did.

39:05.480 --> 39:07.562
I never loved any of you.

39:27.120 --> 39:28.121
(SIGHS)

39:29.560 --> 39:30.686
She's gone?

39:31.400 --> 39:32.401
Yeah.

39:33.640 --> 39:35.369
Maybe too far gone now.

39:37.760 --> 39:39.808
We'll figure out a way to get her back.

39:41.000 --> 39:43.241
Just like we figured out
how to get you back.

39:44.040 --> 39:46.850
You sure this is the me you want?
With all the baggage?

39:47.920 --> 39:50.321
Seeing you without
the weight of everything that's happened,

39:50.520 --> 39:53.763
<i>seeing you happy like you were
before your mother was killed...</i>

39:54.000 --> 39:58.369
Without all of that darkness haunting you,
you were finally free.

40:00.480 --> 40:01.811
It was nice.

40:03.440 --> 40:05.442
I did the same thing months ago.

40:06.480 --> 40:07.606
What do you mean?

40:09.160 --> 40:11.242
That freedom? I had that.

40:11.760 --> 40:13.444
When I was with my mom and dad again
in Flashpoint,

40:13.680 --> 40:15.444
and I could've let it stay like that.

40:15.760 --> 40:18.445
I could've let the memories
of this timeline fade,

40:18.680 --> 40:21.001
but if I'd done that,
I would've lost Joe and Cisco

40:21.160 --> 40:23.527
and Wally and Caitlin and you.

40:25.640 --> 40:28.450
Pain and darkness, it's a part of me.

40:28.640 --> 40:30.324
You know, I need it to fuel me,

40:30.520 --> 40:32.966
to push me to be a better person,
to be a better hero.

40:34.680 --> 40:36.682
Keep me from ever forgetting who I am.

40:38.680 --> 40:42.651
Now that is the Barry Allen
I know and love.

40:50.040 --> 40:52.611
Hey, you guys... Okay! (CHUCKLES)

40:52.840 --> 40:54.524
You guys, you've got to come see this.

40:54.800 --> 40:56.643
You've got to come see this.

41:00.040 --> 41:01.166
What is that?

41:01.360 --> 41:04.967
This is the Speed Force bazooka.
Good, right?

41:05.160 --> 41:06.321
<i>And that's gonna trap Samar'?</i>

41:06.560 --> 41:08.369
There is a tiny little problem.

41:08.560 --> 41:10.688
- What's that?
-it's, uh...

41:10.880 --> 41:15.204
In order to generate enough power
to magnetize Savitar's radial field

41:15.400 --> 41:19.564
and keep him in a state of
perpetual stasis inside the Speed Force,

41:20.080 --> 41:25.041
we need, by my calculations,
3.86 terajoules of energy.

41:25.240 --> 41:28.403
I'm guessing that's more energy
than in a triple-A battery.

41:28.640 --> 41:29.721
H.R.I <i>Yes!</i>

41:29.920 --> 41:31.365
That's more energy than in the sun.

41:32.080 --> 41:34.526
Guys, where are we gonna find
something like that?

41:49.600 --> 41:51.045
