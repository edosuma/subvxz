00:11.485 --> 00:12.979
Oh, God!

00:13.149 --> 00:16.944
The flight rotation was
the highlight of my residency.

00:17.116 --> 00:21.817
I'll be thousands of feet in the air
in something shaped like a potato.

00:21.947 --> 00:24.696
Well, actually,
it's only hundreds of feet.

00:28.601 --> 00:30.162
Oh, God!

00:32.154 --> 00:35.382
Don't they have
ambulances in this sticks?

00:35.545 --> 00:38.993
They don't have a trauma center
in Boone County. If it's bad, we go.

00:39.160 --> 00:42.291
- How far?
- Fifty, 60 miles.

00:42.456 --> 00:48.270
Head up. Didn't you know this
was a requirement of your residency?

00:48.439 --> 00:52.662
All right, deep breath.
Let it out slowly.

00:53.622 --> 00:56.404
Okay. My knees won't move!

00:56.566 --> 00:58.933
Come on. Stay low.

01:00.000 --> 01:06.074

01:09.844 --> 01:14.349
- Dee McManus, Susan Lewis.
- Hi. First flight?

01:22.609 --> 01:26.765
The sum of the angles of a triangle
equals 180 degrees, right?

01:26.896 --> 01:30.409
- Hey, Carol.
- Hi, Doug.

01:30.609 --> 01:33.924
- Hi.
- Doug Ross, this is William Litman.

01:34.127 --> 01:38.469
- William is my lab partner.
- No kidding?

01:38.639 --> 01:39.686
How's it going?

01:39.855 --> 01:43.847
I have an intuitive 19th-century
Euclidean mind.

01:44.014 --> 01:47.975
It's actually crippling to the
understanding of the geometric...

01:48.142 --> 01:51.207
- I'm flunking out.
- What are you working on?

01:51.373 --> 01:57.253
String theory. The multi-dimensional
curvature of time and space.

01:57.388 --> 02:00.803
The Riemannian manifold is
"M" dimensional space...

02:00.972 --> 02:03.392
...that locally looks
like "N" dimensional space...

02:03.595 --> 02:06.693
...when "M" is less than "N."

02:13.737 --> 02:17.665
Susan, take a look. It's beautiful.

02:17.832 --> 02:21.694
- What are you doing?
- Hyperventilating. Leave me alone.

02:23.624 --> 02:28.893
You should really check out this view.
It helps you set your gyroscope.

02:29.863 --> 02:31.750
- What was that?
- The pilot.

02:31.910 --> 02:37.506
He was just adjusting
the rotor pitch. Absolutely normal.

02:37.669 --> 02:40.320
Right. Normal.

02:41.381 --> 02:43.650
There it is.

02:45.860 --> 02:49.656
Oh, man! We're first on scene.

02:49.828 --> 02:51.802
We're gonna need
the O-neg and blood Y's.

02:51.971 --> 02:54.337
There's a field near 5:00.

02:54.498 --> 02:56.833
Oh, God!

03:23.710 --> 03:25.881
Stay low and watch the tail rotors.

03:26.046 --> 03:29.940
We've got five victims.
Hay truck and a van hit head-on.

03:30.109 --> 03:32.181
Two ejected and three are trapped.

03:32.317 --> 03:35.034
- Where is the fire response?
- Two engines and an ambulance en route.

03:35.197 --> 03:37.879
- ETA?
- Thirty minutes.

03:38.076 --> 03:40.596
Triage first.
Susan, you check the car.

03:46.394 --> 03:49.209
It's all right, sweetie.

03:52.345 --> 03:54.833
Please get us out of this car!

04:43.698 --> 04:47.145
Yes, I'm still holding
for authorization. Hello?

04:47.345 --> 04:49.766
Dallas by three, you think?

04:49.936 --> 04:51.594
ER. Hold on.

04:51.760 --> 04:55.982
ICU's got no beds till 1999,
and they're sending us two vents.

04:56.143 --> 04:58.445
Way to go, Mr. Gomez!

04:58.608 --> 05:00.330
Chuny, we need
more IVAC's in 3.

05:00.494 --> 05:03.593
Patric Brazil,
metastatic prostate cancer.

05:03.759 --> 05:07.435
Cough, fever, two months
progressive weakness.

05:07.598 --> 05:12.333
Gave 300 cc's of saline.
He's a no-code.

05:12.461 --> 05:16.072
I've been Mr. B's
caretaker for 22 years.

05:16.268 --> 05:19.780
He wants to be cryogenically preserved
when he deanimates.

05:19.947 --> 05:23.842
- He wants to what?
- Be put on ice when he croaks.

05:24.012 --> 05:28.233
He's been waiting eight years to join
Mrs. B in their suspension capsule.

05:30.346 --> 05:32.614
His wife's been frozen
for eight years?

05:32.777 --> 05:38.341
It was their 50th anniversary
present to each other.

05:38.505 --> 05:42.367
They want to be preserved so that
they could come back in the future.

05:42.505 --> 05:45.919
Just like those dinosaurs
in that movie.

05:46.119 --> 05:48.574
Isn't it romantic?

05:48.776 --> 05:53.150
Let's hang a dobutamine drip.
Start at 10 mcg per kilo...

05:53.319 --> 05:55.653
- Watch the IV.
- Settle down, Mr. Sotcheck.

05:55.814 --> 05:58.530
Rescue 1-16 for you to rule out MI.

05:58.693 --> 06:02.468
- We're swamped.
- Who's covering Haleh's vacation?

06:02.629 --> 06:06.240
The last nurse who floated down here
hid in the bathroom.

06:06.405 --> 06:08.958
- Sterling from Med-Surg West.
- Rhonda Sterling?

06:09.125 --> 06:12.604
- Yeah, what's wrong with her?
- She's a floor nurse.

06:12.739 --> 06:15.838
- I'm not babysitting her.
- Me neither.

06:17.923 --> 06:19.264
The fire's out!

06:19.427 --> 06:22.425
- What's your name?
- Gail. She's only 10 days old.

06:22.626 --> 06:26.423
- Is she all right?
- She's moving and crying.

06:27.233 --> 06:30.363
- I'm Dr. Lewis. What's your name?
- Zach.

06:30.528 --> 06:33.627
- Gail, does your neck hurt?
- Is he all right?

06:33.792 --> 06:35.580
Get a C-collar on her.

06:35.744 --> 06:38.329
Sir? Sir, can you hear me?

06:38.495 --> 06:41.342
It's brain matter. The guy's a goner.

06:50.589 --> 06:52.662
Get him on oxygen.

07:03.355 --> 07:06.257
Where, Zach? Your neck?

07:07.194 --> 07:09.398
Does this hurt?

07:09.562 --> 07:12.977
David? Where's my husband?

07:13.145 --> 07:15.894
Gail, where are you hurt?

07:16.025 --> 07:20.366
My right leg and my side.
David. Please!

07:20.536 --> 07:24.114
- Dr. Greene's working on him.
- My husband is a doctor.

07:24.312 --> 07:27.093
He has to check on the children.

07:27.255 --> 07:29.622
- He's a pediatrician.
- Go, I'll stand by.

07:29.816 --> 07:33.328
Okay, I'm gonna
go check on your husband.

07:39.125 --> 07:41.711
The trucker's gone.
I need you here.

07:41.878 --> 07:43.339
He's still moving.

07:43.509 --> 07:46.225
He's pulseless
with massive head trauma.

07:46.388 --> 07:50.185
I've got a tension hemopneumo
that we can save.

07:51.155 --> 07:53.043
Needle him, left side.

07:58.290 --> 08:00.592
He's decompressing.

08:06.673 --> 08:09.324
Thirty-two French.

08:09.489 --> 08:11.627
This guy's a pediatrician.

08:11.793 --> 08:14.542
- Really?
- His family's in the van.

08:14.704 --> 08:16.645
Wife and newborn baby girl.

08:16.815 --> 08:20.612
Wife's stable.
There's a boy about 8 years old.

08:20.751 --> 08:23.914
Number four-two facial fracture.
I'm worried about his airway.

08:24.078 --> 08:26.217
I'm in. Hook it up to the Foley bag.

08:26.414 --> 08:28.072
He's hemorrhaging.

08:28.270 --> 08:30.440
Grab two units
O-neg out of the cooler.

08:30.605 --> 08:32.580
I'll start a line.

08:34.381 --> 08:37.380
- What about my husband?
- Gail, we're getting you out.

08:37.548 --> 08:40.395
Yeah, I'm still holding.

08:41.388 --> 08:45.894
Do you like Green Bay
minus seven over Washington?

08:46.059 --> 08:49.157
- Excuse me.
- Hang on one second.

08:51.306 --> 08:54.088
Please don't tell!
Mommy!

08:54.250 --> 08:56.420
Where do you want him?

08:56.585 --> 08:59.651
Curtain Area 3. End of the hall.

08:59.849 --> 09:01.888
Don't tell her!

09:08.391 --> 09:11.774
- Carol Hathaway?
- Carol.

09:13.766 --> 09:16.766
I was pulled off my ward
and assigned down here.

09:16.934 --> 09:18.625
What patient do you want me to take?

09:18.790 --> 09:23.197
Actually, we share our patients here.
Let me show you.

09:24.165 --> 09:27.198
Here are the patients
that are waiting to be seen.

09:27.365 --> 09:30.299
Nursing orders are flagged
and put over here, so when you're...

09:30.501 --> 09:34.394
I'll take Mr. Washington.
Where is Curtain Area 3?

09:34.596 --> 09:36.450
- There.
- Thank you.

09:40.994 --> 09:44.409
- Secure his head.
- We need to start a second line.

09:44.578 --> 09:47.611
Dr. Lewis!
The boy's stopped breathing.

09:47.778 --> 09:49.338
Go!

09:49.793 --> 09:51.680
Watch his C-spine!

09:55.776 --> 09:57.979
Keep in-line traction.

09:59.935 --> 10:02.619
You're in the way.

10:02.815 --> 10:06.742
Too much blood. I need suction.
6.0 tube.

10:08.414 --> 10:12.407
- Another 6.0.
- That was it.

10:12.573 --> 10:15.639
Okay, 5.5.

10:15.805 --> 10:17.560
Mark, I need your help.

10:17.724 --> 10:19.928
Get him on the chopper.

10:21.148 --> 10:23.765
We're taking care of him, Gail.

10:24.571 --> 10:29.208
Please don't let him die!

10:29.339 --> 10:31.760
- I can't see. Turn it up.
- It is up.

10:31.931 --> 10:34.778
There's better control in the chopper.

10:37.561 --> 10:40.910
Ready? One, two, three.

10:43.384 --> 10:47.443
- Doctor, I need you to start this IV.
- Okay.

10:48.440 --> 10:51.439
Go on, I'll check it out.

10:51.607 --> 10:53.582
- What's up?
- She needs an IV.

10:53.751 --> 10:57.067
Usually we try a few times
before we call a doc.

10:57.238 --> 11:01.361
Up in Med-Surg
we call the doctor when we miss.

11:01.493 --> 11:07.243
I'll do it. Mrs. Fesmire needs
20 of KCL in her IV in 3.

11:07.446 --> 11:12.179
- Where's the potassium?
- In the Med Room under "P."

11:15.347 --> 11:18.696
I can see the vocal cords.
I'm in.

11:23.890 --> 11:26.736
- I'll be right back.
- Susan!

11:26.898 --> 11:29.451
All right, Fred, fire it up.

11:29.617 --> 11:31.024
Susan!

11:33.808 --> 11:37.191
- How much longer?
- 20 or 30 minutes.

11:38.928 --> 11:44.590
Gail, we're taking your son and your
husband to County General Hospital.

11:44.751 --> 11:47.816
- Are they all right?
- They need to go to a trauma center.

11:47.982 --> 11:51.113
- How will I know what's happening?
- I will get word to you, Gail.

11:51.278 --> 11:53.732
- Please!
- I promise.

12:03.340 --> 12:05.957
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

12:30.503 --> 12:33.764
- It's Dr. Greene from the whirlybird.
- Where's Mrs. Fesmire's potassium?

12:33.927 --> 12:36.741
I'm on break. I'm getting to her.

12:36.870 --> 12:38.942
This is County General on Beta-two.
Go ahead.

12:39.110 --> 12:44.292
<i>We're incoming on Air-vac One</i>
<i>with two major traumas.</i>

12:44.453 --> 12:47.235
Grab Lydia and Chuny.
Tell them to clear the trauma rooms.

12:47.397 --> 12:49.763
- Go ahead, Air-Vac One.
- I'm gonna need a vent...

12:51.332 --> 12:53.852
Goodbye, Mr. B.

13:00.387 --> 13:04.794
You will keep him cold
until they come for him, won't you?

13:05.794 --> 13:09.917
So that he could be with his wife.

13:10.049 --> 13:12.351
- Please?
- Sure.

13:15.104 --> 13:17.341
Should I clean out the fridge?

13:32.638 --> 13:37.209
The dad's got
a hemopneumo and a head trauma.

13:37.373 --> 13:42.129
7-year-old had an obstructed
airway. He's getting shocky.

13:44.508 --> 13:46.646
- Good job, Susan.
- What?

13:46.843 --> 13:48.981
I said good job.

13:49.179 --> 13:51.001
Draw up meds.

13:52.187 --> 13:54.674
Watch that IV. Fluids wide open.

13:54.842 --> 13:59.347
Let's get a cross-table, CBC,
type and cross for four units...

13:59.513 --> 14:02.230
Draw up a saline-flush crash cart.

14:03.225 --> 14:07.414
- Where is the saline?
- Pulse 160, thready...

14:07.576 --> 14:09.551
- He's waking up.
- Hey, Zach.

14:09.719 --> 14:13.264
That tube in your throat
is helping you breathe.

14:13.399 --> 14:16.782
- Set up for lavage.
- Want a gas?

14:16.983 --> 14:19.371
Got it. You bet.

14:26.325 --> 14:28.943
Chuny, give me a hand right here.

14:31.284 --> 14:34.765
Okay, we got a bloody tap.
Page Benton.

14:34.931 --> 14:37.964
See if the dad will sign
a consent form for an ex-lap.

14:38.483 --> 14:42.095
- Put that O-neg on the rapid infuser.
- Is he conscious?

14:42.227 --> 14:45.771
He's responding to pain.
Dr. Herlihy, open your eyes.

14:47.538 --> 14:50.668
Somebody needs to sign
his son's surgical consent.

14:50.865 --> 14:53.483
BP's low, 70 palp.
Pulse ox is only 85.

14:53.681 --> 14:56.233
Ask Jerry to track down
the number of the hospital...

14:56.399 --> 14:59.945
...in Boone County where they're
taking the mother and the baby.

15:00.112 --> 15:02.216
Do the heart sounds
seem distant to you?

15:02.383 --> 15:04.685
Tamponade?

15:04.847 --> 15:07.432
- Hang in there, Zach.
- Hold him still.

15:07.599 --> 15:11.210
- He's gotta be sedated.
- Give him Versed, one milligram IV.

15:11.374 --> 15:13.261
Where is it?

15:14.670 --> 15:17.516
It's clotted.
I need that saline.

15:17.677 --> 15:19.270
- Another liter.
- Let's go!

15:19.436 --> 15:23.713
Zach, I'm gonna give you
something to help you sleep, okay?

15:23.916 --> 15:25.542
Hold him.

15:26.828 --> 15:28.932
What was that? Did it hurt?

15:29.099 --> 15:30.953
Are you sure that's saline?

15:33.226 --> 15:37.055
- Oh, my God! That's potassium.
- How much went in?

15:37.226 --> 15:39.331
- About a quarter cc.
- Insulin and glucose.

15:39.497 --> 15:42.595
- Where is it?
- Second drawer.

15:42.761 --> 15:46.819
Hold on. It's probably
not enough to stop his heart.

15:48.872 --> 15:49.919
I think we're gonna be okay.

15:50.088 --> 15:53.699
- What do you got?
- 7-year-old TC.

15:53.894 --> 15:57.823
Airway compromised at the scene.
Peritoneal lavage was positive.

16:00.774 --> 16:05.563
- BP's crashing, 60 palp.
- Pericardiocentesis tray.

16:05.733 --> 16:08.450
- Go ahead.
- I'll drop the central line.

16:08.613 --> 16:12.834
Hook an alligator clip
to an EKG lead. Use V-1.

16:13.828 --> 16:15.770
Not mine.

16:16.772 --> 16:18.527
It's the patient's.

16:18.659 --> 16:22.303
He's a doctor. It might be his office.
Why don't you dial the number?

16:22.467 --> 16:24.921
Jerry called Dwight Hospital.
The baby and wife haven't arrived.

16:25.090 --> 16:27.992
- Are they on their way?
- I don't know.

16:30.017 --> 16:31.740
- What do we have?
- Blunt abdominal trauma.

16:31.905 --> 16:35.450
Hypotensive intraperitoneal hemorrhage
confirmed by lavage.

16:35.616 --> 16:39.544
Facial trauma intubated in the field
with an RSI. H&H is 11, 32.

16:39.711 --> 16:42.908
Type and cross four, 650 cc's
of saline. We're set onboard.

16:43.072 --> 16:45.689
- Way to go, Carter!
- Let's take him up.

16:45.855 --> 16:48.343
Where are his parents?

16:48.511 --> 16:50.298
Second unit's in.

16:50.462 --> 16:55.547
So you got his partner to take calls?
Okay, we'll let you know.

16:56.701 --> 17:01.818
Forty cc's non-clotting blood, out.

17:01.981 --> 17:06.519
Dr. Herlihy, you've been
in an accident. You're in the ER.

17:07.516 --> 17:10.384
BP's back up, 120 over 80.

17:10.555 --> 17:13.457
I'm worried about
an intracranial bleed.

17:13.627 --> 17:15.797
- The nurse goes with him.
- Am I on call?

17:15.962 --> 17:21.493
You're a patient.
You were involved in traffic accident.

17:21.657 --> 17:24.952
Your son, Zach, has just
been taken up to surgery.

17:25.079 --> 17:28.560
- Surgery?
- He was injured in the accident.

17:28.728 --> 17:30.288
What accident?

17:30.935 --> 17:32.943
Get a rush on that head CT.

17:33.144 --> 17:35.958
Zach, everything's gonna be okay.

17:44.214 --> 17:47.180
- We could've killed that boy.
- I got confused.

17:47.412 --> 17:51.984
- You have no business working the ER.
- You think I don't know that?

17:52.149 --> 17:55.628
I want you to restock supplies
for the rest of the day.

17:55.764 --> 17:59.179
This is Carol Hathaway in the ER.
Clear a CT room, please.

18:03.283 --> 18:06.445
Where's the number
for chopper dispatch?

18:10.354 --> 18:12.328
Mark, can I run something past you?

18:12.497 --> 18:17.254
A guy died, and I don't know what to do
about his cryogenics request.

18:17.424 --> 18:21.100
He and his wife bought a tank so
they could be frozen when they died.

18:21.263 --> 18:24.973
- Where is his wife now?
- In the tank.

18:25.135 --> 18:29.063
I have an number for
a cryogenics company in California.

18:30.510 --> 18:33.193
Yeah, still holding.

18:39.181 --> 18:42.312
- What?
- Nothing.

18:43.532 --> 18:46.379
Page me as soon as you know.

18:47.371 --> 18:51.331
The helicopter's standing by.
We may have to get the wife and baby.

18:53.259 --> 18:56.739
- Okay, DeBakey.
- 5.0 Prolene on a Castroviejo.

18:56.906 --> 18:58.978
- Retract caudally.
- Retractor.

18:59.114 --> 19:02.594
Splenic vein's repaired.
What about this pancreas?

19:02.762 --> 19:06.623
I'd resect rather than
do a subtotal pancreatectomy.

19:06.824 --> 19:11.133
I agree. Metz.
How would you repair after resection?

19:11.336 --> 19:15.972
Interrupted horizontal mattresses and
a figure eight in the pancreatic duct.

19:16.135 --> 19:19.844
- 3.0 silk on a needle driver.
- Anything else to do?

19:20.006 --> 19:21.861
Irrigate. Run the bowel under control.

19:22.023 --> 19:25.121
Insert a Jackson-Pratt drain
through a separate stab wound.

19:25.286 --> 19:29.147
And use cautery instead of a scalpel
to minimize bleeding.

19:29.316 --> 19:33.539
- Then close.
- Do exactly what you just described.

19:33.669 --> 19:37.661
All right, cut the suture
three millimeters, no longer.

19:37.860 --> 19:40.707
Irrigate. Normal saline.
Make sure it's warm.

19:44.099 --> 19:46.238
Park her in the hall
till we can clear an exam room.

19:46.403 --> 19:49.598
- Have you seen Susan?
- She got paged to chopper duty.

19:55.680 --> 19:59.029
- What's up?
- I need ice, lots of ice.

19:59.201 --> 20:03.804
California Cryonics said to put him
on ice until their local rep arrives.

20:03.936 --> 20:06.237
They better hurry.

20:07.806 --> 20:10.173
Dr. Lewis!

20:11.167 --> 20:16.184
- Susan, are you all right?
- Yeah, I want to bring them in.

20:16.349 --> 20:19.414
- I'll go.
- No, I'm fine.

20:19.580 --> 20:22.646
Really?
You can stay here with Herlihy.

20:22.812 --> 20:25.561
Dr. Lewis.
We gotta go.

20:50.425 --> 20:53.293
May I?
See your orders?

20:56.567 --> 21:00.309
John, take these to ICU
and make sure they're carried out...

21:00.471 --> 21:02.326
...as meticulously as written.

21:02.487 --> 21:05.650
Peter, care to join me
in a sarcoma resection?

21:05.782 --> 21:08.051
- Yeah, I'd love to.
- Good.

21:08.213 --> 21:12.205
Gant can cover any trauma calls.
Scrub in, in 45 minutes.

21:12.372 --> 21:14.511
Don't you just love her?

21:17.523 --> 21:21.647
- Where's Zach? Where's my husband?
- Your husband was unconscious.

21:21.811 --> 21:23.665
He woke up confused and disoriented.

21:23.859 --> 21:27.120
He has a head injury?
What about my son?

21:27.282 --> 21:30.958
- He's in surgery.
- Don't worry. They're in good hands.

21:31.121 --> 21:32.136
Move!

21:33.329 --> 21:35.217
Does this hurt?

21:37.328 --> 21:39.368
BP's okay, 115 over 65.

21:39.504 --> 21:44.075
Let's get a C-spine.
H&H, type and cross for four.

21:45.136 --> 21:48.364
- Good set of lungs on her.
- Respiratory rate's kind of high.

21:48.526 --> 21:51.428
- Who knows with all that crying?
- It's 60, pulse 160.

21:51.630 --> 21:56.005
Abdomen's distended.
She's been taking in a lot of air.

21:56.173 --> 22:00.167
Get a baby Gram,
CBC and a gas.

22:00.334 --> 22:04.610
Darling, are you hurt
or just mad at the world?

22:08.811 --> 22:11.146
- What'll it be?
- Do you believe in reincarnation?

22:11.275 --> 22:15.584
Next life I'm coming back
as Cindy Crawford.

22:15.755 --> 22:19.845
A deceased patient wants
to be cryogenically preserved.

22:20.042 --> 22:23.238
We gotta freeze a dead guy.
You got any ice?

22:23.401 --> 22:25.736
- Neck looks okay.
- CT was normal.

22:25.929 --> 22:28.263
Dad's still altered,
they're doing an MRI.

22:28.425 --> 22:32.287
- Why did they take Megan away?
- She's just next door.

22:32.455 --> 22:35.652
- Zach's out of surgery.
- He's gonna be all right?

22:35.815 --> 22:38.532
He's in ICU.
I'll check on him as soon as I can.

22:38.694 --> 22:41.923
Oh, God! I need my husband.

22:42.086 --> 22:45.052
Please. Where is David?

22:47.430 --> 22:51.706
- Her abdomen's kind of firm.
- She swallowed a lot of air.

22:51.909 --> 22:54.843
- What shall we do?
- What is it, Gant?

22:55.045 --> 22:58.110
Her abdomen's persistently distended.
She keeps crying.

22:58.276 --> 23:01.210
Her resps are high.
The BP, the pulses and color are okay.

23:01.379 --> 23:04.345
- Why didn't you drop an NG?
- We considered it...

23:04.514 --> 23:08.027
- In such a small baby?
- Do it off the rectal thermometer.

23:08.194 --> 23:12.950
You didn't do a full surgical
evaluation of the patient, Dr. Gant.

23:15.521 --> 23:17.724
It's positive for blood.
Prep a cutdown tray.

23:17.889 --> 23:19.994
Type and cross for two units
and page Keaton.

23:20.161 --> 23:23.193
- Where's her mother?
- Trauma 1.

23:23.392 --> 23:26.523
Dr. Ross and I thought
it was an equivocal exam.

23:26.687 --> 23:29.369
If you don't know what you're doing,
call someone who does.

23:29.534 --> 23:31.673
Hi, I'm Dr. Benton.

23:31.838 --> 23:35.154
Your daughter has internal injuries
that's gonna require an operation.

23:35.326 --> 23:37.365
She's only 10 days old.

23:37.534 --> 23:39.803
It's okay.
Dr. Keaton will be with her.

23:39.966 --> 23:42.812
And she's the best
pediatric surgeon in Chicago.

23:42.972 --> 23:46.649
We need your consent
for an exploratory laparotomy.

23:46.781 --> 23:49.627
Where's my husband?
I want him to sign for it.

23:49.787 --> 23:52.821
Her husband's a pediatrician.
He can't do it right now.

23:52.988 --> 23:56.663
He handles all
the family medical decisions.

23:57.499 --> 24:00.346
- You can do this, Gail.
- But I don't know.

24:00.538 --> 24:03.155
Your baby needs it.

24:07.194 --> 24:09.080
Okay.

24:14.455 --> 24:17.522
Cutdown tray. Use a volutrol.
We may have to transfuse.

24:17.687 --> 24:19.989
Gant was on track.
I talked him out of it.

24:20.119 --> 24:22.006
Hang D5, 40 normal.

24:22.166 --> 24:25.963
- What do you think, Peter?
- She has an acute abdomen.

24:26.166 --> 24:28.270
Hi, pretty girl.

24:28.469 --> 24:31.884
- Vitals?
- BP's 80 over 40, pulse 160.

24:32.085 --> 24:34.899
Resps 65, temp's 101.4.

24:35.092 --> 24:38.921
- Oh, what blue, blue eyes!
- 92 room air.

24:40.403 --> 24:42.574
Teacup, that's too low.

24:42.739 --> 24:46.316
Let's get her on O-2,
four liters by mask.

24:47.538 --> 24:50.026
Did you appreciate
the periumbilical redness?

24:50.162 --> 24:52.845
- The abdomen's a little tight.
- No, I missed it.

24:53.010 --> 24:55.017
Well, it's easy to miss.

24:55.186 --> 24:56.844
- Why a cutdown?
- No veins.

24:57.041 --> 25:00.521
Twenty-two angio.
This was a nice pickup, Peter.

25:00.720 --> 25:02.575
Thank you.

25:03.600 --> 25:06.861
Ah, yes. There we go.

25:07.727 --> 25:10.182
I couldn't see or feel a vein.

25:10.351 --> 25:13.197
It's just a matter
of knowing where it is.

25:13.358 --> 25:17.003
Let's get her a cross-table lateral
and check for free air.

25:17.166 --> 25:19.053
- Any thoughts on antibiotics?
- Since you don't need...

25:19.213 --> 25:23.370
...anaerobic coverage on newborns,
I'd go with amp and gent.

25:23.500 --> 25:26.816
Dennis, since you did the trauma
assessment, why don't you scrub in?

25:26.988 --> 25:28.995
Peter, let's go talk to Mom.

25:35.244 --> 25:36.552
Good girl.

25:42.985 --> 25:46.214
There you go, Mr. Brazil.
Shrimp cocktail time.

25:46.377 --> 25:50.151
Hubert Skinner, California Cryonics.
Mr. Brazil.

25:50.312 --> 25:53.890
- You got some kind of I.D.?
- It's all there.

25:54.056 --> 25:56.870
Give him
10,000 units of heparin stat.

25:56.999 --> 26:00.261
I'll pack him up,
and we'll be on our way.

26:00.423 --> 26:03.324
- Is he a doctor?
- I don't think so. What do we do?

26:03.526 --> 26:05.828
The heparin can't hurt,
him being dead and all.

26:05.990 --> 26:10.080
In the newborn, I use
a transverse abdominal incision.

26:10.245 --> 26:13.245
The rectus is thin
so there's less pain post-op.

26:14.245 --> 26:17.244
We're using a respirator,
so atelectasis isn't an issue.

26:17.412 --> 26:19.103
Zap that little bleeder.

26:19.268 --> 26:20.860
- Cautery.
- Fifteen blade.

26:21.027 --> 26:22.369
If there's a perforation...

26:22.532 --> 26:26.655
...we should get a gush of air
when I nick the peritoneum.

26:26.787 --> 26:29.852
- There it is.
- She's easier to ventilate.

26:30.018 --> 26:32.189
Dennis, why do we want
to keep bleeding to a minimum?

26:32.354 --> 26:34.240
Transfusions are dangerous.

26:34.433 --> 26:37.848
You can't type and cross-match blood
because of the fetal hemoglobin.

26:38.049 --> 26:43.001
There it is. Perfed jejunum.
You're teaching your interns well.

26:46.591 --> 26:49.373
He's in and out. MRI was normal.

26:49.535 --> 26:52.404
Dr. Herlihy,
do you remember my name?

26:53.406 --> 26:56.024
- Where's my wife and kids?
- I'm Mark Greene.

26:56.190 --> 26:58.610
Your family was involved
in a traffic accident.

26:58.749 --> 27:01.368
Your wife's in the ER,
with a tib-fib fracture.

27:01.534 --> 27:04.468
Zach had facial trauma
and hemoperitoneum.

27:04.637 --> 27:06.458
He's out of surgery in ICU.

27:06.652 --> 27:09.652
- Was it his spleen?
- No. Pancreatic injury.

27:09.852 --> 27:11.227
What about Megan?

27:11.388 --> 27:14.999
Megan just went up
to rule out intestinal perforation.

27:15.163 --> 27:17.302
Why? What happened to her?

27:17.467 --> 27:20.499
She was in the accident with you.

27:20.666 --> 27:23.187
What accident?

27:23.354 --> 27:25.263
Do you know my name?

27:25.433 --> 27:27.473
No. Should I?

27:32.505 --> 27:34.261
It's okay.

27:34.840 --> 27:39.411
Gently. To repair it, we use
a 4.0 silk, interrupted Hufnagel.

27:39.607 --> 27:41.265
Field looks dry.

27:41.463 --> 27:43.764
You don't need
a two-layer in anastomosis.

27:43.926 --> 27:46.708
Cautery alone gives you hemostasis.

27:46.870 --> 27:48.364
Let's irrigate. Warm saline, please.

27:48.534 --> 27:50.835
Zach's abdomen is distending.

27:50.997 --> 27:54.095
- Any changes in his vitals or pulse?
- I think he's bleeding.

27:54.261 --> 27:58.188
Damn! Peter, do you think
you're ready to finish alone?

27:58.356 --> 28:00.461
- Yeah.
- Nothing fancy. Just close.

28:04.275 --> 28:07.756
All right, people. Let's go.
Thank you. One more.

28:08.594 --> 28:10.983
His abdomen is more distended.

28:11.186 --> 28:13.455
- Has he regained consciousness?
- No.

28:14.418 --> 28:17.679
Four-by-eight. Thank you.

28:18.961 --> 28:23.084
- All right. Completely dry.
- What's that?

28:24.080 --> 28:27.822
Looks like a little fiber and debris
on the liver surface.

28:27.983 --> 28:30.732
- Should I call Dr. Keaton?
- No. I'll clean it out.

28:35.598 --> 28:39.755
Okay, got it. Let's close
the peritoneum first. 3.0 Vicryl.

28:43.725 --> 28:47.401
Now, retract medially. Cut.

28:50.444 --> 28:51.655
Good.

28:51.820 --> 28:54.022
- There's a little blood.
- Where?

28:54.187 --> 28:57.504
Oozing from the liver
where you just touched it.

28:57.675 --> 29:02.431
I'll put a little pressure on it.
Use suction. Gently, okay?

29:08.169 --> 29:10.471
Damn it!

29:11.976 --> 29:14.114
- It's still oozing.
- I'm not closing while it's bleeding.

29:14.312 --> 29:18.369
I'll put a stitch in for hemostasis.
4.0 chromic on an S-H now.

29:21.127 --> 29:23.494
Retract caudally.

29:24.199 --> 29:26.654
Come on, Gant. Retractor.

29:29.126 --> 29:31.972
- Is Anesthesia standing by?
- I called them.

29:37.124 --> 29:42.013
- He is distended. Vitals?
- Stable. BP 90 over 60. Pulse is 96.

29:42.148 --> 29:45.725
Pulse ox is 99 percent.
Should I clear an O.R.?

29:45.923 --> 29:49.720
Hang on.
Disconnect the NG from the wall.

29:53.698 --> 29:57.975
Sometimes you get
an erosive gastritis. Hook it back up.

30:01.121 --> 30:03.804
Clots can block the NG
causing acute dilatation.

30:03.968 --> 30:07.263
Irrigate it out
and crisis resolved.

30:10.143 --> 30:12.990
It's just experience, doctor.

30:15.518 --> 30:17.460
- She's still bleeding!
- I can see that.

30:17.662 --> 30:20.117
I'll put a gelfoam
on the bleeding site.

30:20.318 --> 30:23.514
You apply pressure. Come on.

30:23.677 --> 30:26.197
- Do you want me to get Dr. Keaton?
- No.

30:26.365 --> 30:31.601
More suction. I'm gonna oversew.
2.0 chromic on an S-H.

30:31.772 --> 30:33.299
Heart rate's starting to fluctuate.

30:33.468 --> 30:35.856
Give me a bolus
of normal saline, 40 cc's.

30:36.027 --> 30:38.809
The liver's so fragile,
my stitch cut right through.

30:38.971 --> 30:41.304
I'm gonna take a bigger bite.
Retract this way.

30:41.434 --> 30:44.052
You need to get this baby
off the table.

30:44.218 --> 30:46.553
All right, bag her faster, damn it!

30:48.889 --> 30:50.776
- I'm getting Keaton.
- No!

30:50.937 --> 30:52.792
Go! Go!

30:58.040 --> 31:02.130
Do you think it'll help her
to see her husband like this?

31:04.535 --> 31:08.657
Megan's in surgery. Zach's in ICU.
Your husband got out of X-ray.

31:08.822 --> 31:11.310
- He's okay?
- His tests are normal, but...

31:11.478 --> 31:13.549
...there's still memory loss.

31:13.685 --> 31:15.757
Could it be permanent?

31:15.925 --> 31:19.273
You can see these things
in a concussion.

31:19.444 --> 31:23.535
- But it might be?
- We just have to wait and see.

31:24.564 --> 31:26.603
- Blood loss?
- A hundred cc's.

31:26.803 --> 31:29.291
One third of her volume.
What did you do to her liver?

31:29.459 --> 31:33.233
I was trying to peel away
some fiber and debris.

31:34.226 --> 31:35.720
Move.

31:35.890 --> 31:39.915
- 2.0 chromic on an S-H.
- It started to ooze. Clear.

31:40.081 --> 31:42.285
There's no way
to control the bleeding.

31:42.449 --> 31:45.612
Peter, handle the suction.
Dennis, retract distally.

31:45.744 --> 31:48.494
Cautery. Crank it up to 18.

31:48.656 --> 31:50.215
Pulse and BP are destabilizing.

31:50.383 --> 31:52.522
We have to transfuse
with unwashed O-neg.

31:52.719 --> 31:54.028
2.0 chromic. Keep them coming.

31:54.223 --> 31:56.524
She's bradying down. Rate's 80.

31:56.686 --> 32:00.298
3.0 Vicryl for the peritoneum
muscles and staples for the skin.

32:09.101 --> 32:10.954
David?

32:11.180 --> 32:13.351
Oh, my God! David.

32:13.516 --> 32:15.849
- What happened?
- Didn't you tell him?

32:16.011 --> 32:20.289
- We did. Many times.
- Zach's condition is stabilized.

32:20.427 --> 32:22.847
Zach?

32:23.018 --> 32:26.695
- What about Megan?
- Dr. Benton's closing right now.

32:26.890 --> 32:28.831
That's wonderful news.

32:29.865 --> 32:32.679
Was there a truck?

32:33.929 --> 32:38.151
Yeah. Yeah, there was a truck.

32:43.687 --> 32:46.207
- What were you thinking?
- There was debris.

32:46.375 --> 32:48.763
- I only told you to close.
- In my judgment...

32:48.934 --> 32:53.407
I didn't ask for your judgment!
Perry, Dennis, set up a vent.

32:54.373 --> 32:57.242
F-I O-2 at 100 percent.
Stand by with dopamine...

33:15.714 --> 33:19.772
- Does that say chicken belt?
- Conjunctivitis.

33:19.937 --> 33:22.457
I hate chart QA.

33:29.056 --> 33:32.535
- What?
- Nothing.

33:34.014 --> 33:36.862
Thanks for helping me in the chopper.

33:37.054 --> 33:39.574
No problem.

33:51.740 --> 33:53.845
Things can get pressured in here.

33:53.979 --> 33:57.972
It just isn't a place
for someone who is inexperienced.

33:58.970 --> 34:00.792
I can't have you work here again.

34:23.415 --> 34:25.324
Zach?

34:25.463 --> 34:27.764
Oh, God!

34:27.926 --> 34:30.380
- Can I touch him?
- Sure.

34:42.163 --> 34:45.011
Zach, honey, it's Mommy.

34:46.418 --> 34:50.379
I'm gonna stay right here
until you wake up.

34:56.850 --> 35:02.032
- What about Megan?
- No one from Surgery's talked to you?

35:02.992 --> 35:06.375
- I'll go find out what's going on.
- Thank you.

35:11.280 --> 35:14.540
- Why hasn't anyone talked to her?
- I don't know.

35:14.735 --> 35:16.295
Benton was closing over an hour ago.

35:18.286 --> 35:21.067
- Blood gas has improved.
- Not by much.

35:21.229 --> 35:24.229
Could you excuse us, Kit?
Dennis? Thank you.

35:25.390 --> 35:27.723
I should never
have left you unsupervised.

35:27.884 --> 35:31.975
There are nuances in neonatal surgery.
The liver's more friable.

35:32.108 --> 35:36.647
I wanted a clean field before
I closed. It seemed appropriate.

35:36.812 --> 35:41.633
What's at issue here is that you
ignored my specific instructions.

35:41.834 --> 35:43.776
I followed standard
operative procedures.

35:43.979 --> 35:46.345
I've done it a dozen times
in other patients.

35:46.537 --> 35:49.537
This is not an "other" patient.
This is an infant!

35:49.706 --> 35:51.647
Outside now.

35:56.744 --> 36:00.355
You don't know anything
about pediatric surgery.

36:00.519 --> 36:02.429
Are you unwilling
to learn from your mistakes?

36:02.568 --> 36:04.225
Does it say not to stitch a liver?

36:04.391 --> 36:08.963
You didn't know what you were doing.
You should've called me!

36:09.127 --> 36:10.816
Why did I find
three stitches in there?

36:11.014 --> 36:14.462
Because you arrogantly and blindly
think you have all the answers.

36:14.662 --> 36:16.995
If that baby dies,
it'll be my responsibility...

36:17.188 --> 36:20.123
...but it'll be your fault.
- Dr. Keaton, she's crashing.

36:20.709 --> 36:22.977
Pulse ox is 86.
Heart rate's down to 45.

36:23.140 --> 36:26.075
Decreased breath sounds on the right.

36:26.243 --> 36:28.512
Sounds like a pneumothorax.
Chest x-ray.

36:28.675 --> 36:30.562
Don't need it.

36:30.723 --> 36:33.374
Increase transillumination
on the right side.

36:33.506 --> 36:36.800
- Chest-tube tray.
- This is no longer a teaching case.

36:36.961 --> 36:40.573
- She's gonna need a repeat ABG.
- Pulse is up to 72.

36:40.770 --> 36:43.769
- Dynamap's not registering a BP.
- Get ready with Thermo-Seal.

36:44.609 --> 36:47.424
She's arresting.
Heart rate's down to 20.

36:47.585 --> 36:51.740
Let's start CPR.
Epi one to ten thousand point four.

36:51.903 --> 36:54.424
Atropine.08 milligrams.
How's the blood gas?

36:54.590 --> 36:58.071
PH 7.3. PO-245. PCO-230
on 100 percent oxygen.

36:58.239 --> 37:00.246
We have to put her
on an ECMO bypass.

37:00.415 --> 37:04.091
Kit, call the tech. Get
two units O-neg to prime the system.

37:04.254 --> 37:08.922
- Do we bring her back up to the O.R.?
- No, we'll bring the O.R. To her.

37:10.109 --> 37:11.832
Dr. Greene?

37:12.828 --> 37:14.388
Dr. Herlihy?

37:15.420 --> 37:18.234
- What time is it?
- Eight o'clock.

37:18.396 --> 37:21.177
P.M.?
Where's my family?

37:21.339 --> 37:24.787
Your wife's upstairs.
Both the kids had laparotomies.

37:24.954 --> 37:26.841
A bed opened up for you in ICU.

37:27.002 --> 37:28.944
How'd they do?

37:29.114 --> 37:32.942
Your son's out of surgery.
I don't know about your daughter.

37:33.113 --> 37:36.593
- How do I find out about my daughter?
- I'll check on her.

37:36.760 --> 37:39.028
- Thank you, Dr. Greene.
- Mark.

37:39.160 --> 37:40.654
Mark.

37:44.343 --> 37:48.652
Pedes O.R. Called. His daughter
decompensated in surgery.

38:04.468 --> 38:08.875
- She's still flatline.
- Repeat.04 of epi.

38:10.643 --> 38:13.709
Go ahead, Kit.
How long has she been down?

38:13.875 --> 38:15.980
Twenty-two minutes.

38:17.010 --> 38:19.727
- Is the ECMO circuit primed?
- Yes.

38:19.890 --> 38:22.857
Good. I'm ready.
Venous connection first.

38:24.177 --> 38:26.315
Arterial.

38:27.121 --> 38:29.008
Turn it on.

38:42.094 --> 38:45.955
- We've got a heartbeat and a pulse.
- Faint.

38:46.893 --> 38:47.941
She's pinking up.

38:48.109 --> 38:51.457
Let's get a repeat gas.
We need to anti-coagulate her.

38:51.661 --> 38:55.337
Heparin, 150 units IV.
Start drip at 10 units an hour.

38:55.500 --> 38:59.013
- How come we anti-coagulate her?
- We have to, or her blood will clot.

38:59.180 --> 39:01.699
- Won't she bleed out?
- We have to hope that she doesn't.

39:01.867 --> 39:05.478
I'll dictate an operative report.
Meet me in Pedes ICU in five minutes.

39:05.642 --> 39:07.845
We gotta tell the parents.

39:14.568 --> 39:17.318
Peter, how'd it go?

39:17.481 --> 39:20.960
- How's the baby?
- Not good.

39:26.247 --> 39:28.897
Dr. Benton...

39:29.062 --> 39:31.517
You didn't sign the code sheet.

39:35.077 --> 39:37.532
Hey, we're all human.

39:37.701 --> 39:39.642
We all make mistakes.

39:39.813 --> 39:43.293
Any other words of wisdom, Gant?

39:45.317 --> 39:48.283
You're a real prick, you know that?

39:50.628 --> 39:55.929
Mrs. Herlihy, this is Dr. Keaton.
She operated on both Zach and Megan.

39:56.131 --> 39:57.375
Mrs. Herlihy...

39:57.539 --> 40:01.051
Megan had a perforated intestine
from the accident.

40:01.217 --> 40:05.407
When we operated to repair it,
there were complications.

40:08.928 --> 40:13.434
- What are you saying?
- She's in the NICU on a device...

40:13.600 --> 40:17.342
...that helps her heart and lungs
oxygenate her blood.

40:17.470 --> 40:21.780
There was bleeding during
the operation, and she went into shock.

40:21.950 --> 40:25.593
Then her lung collapsed,
and finally, her heart stopped.

40:26.590 --> 40:29.851
We got it started again by
putting her on a bypass machine.

40:46.843 --> 40:49.231
Is she gonna die?

40:49.370 --> 40:51.737
She's in extremely critical condition.

40:51.898 --> 40:55.159
It's... It is a possibility.

41:59.150 --> 42:04.333
The Lord is my shepherd,
I shall not want.

42:06.221 --> 42:10.214
He makes me lie down
in green pastures.

42:10.381 --> 42:12.268
He...

42:15.884 --> 42:17.444
The Lord is my shepherd,
I shall not want.

42:17.612 --> 42:20.907
He makes me lie down
in green pastures. He's...

42:21.068 --> 42:22.955
Dr. Benton?

42:27.306 --> 42:30.154
I can't remember the words.
