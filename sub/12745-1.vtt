04:35.900 --> 04:37.300
Yeah.

04:37.300 --> 04:39.700
How'd you find this place?

04:39.700 --> 04:41.500
You sent me a map.

04:41.500 --> 04:42.800
Fuck, I did?

04:42.800 --> 04:44.600
Goddamn, man,

04:44.600 --> 04:46.600

get me, dude.

04:46.600 --> 04:49.800
They're trying to eat me like they
got this goddamn tree over here.

04:49.800 --> 04:50.900
Yeah, I read about that.

04:50.900 --> 04:53.000
It's a parasite,
a beetle, right?

04:54.000 --> 04:55.000
Yeah, yeah.

04:55.000 --> 04:57.500
It fucking flies, too.
Did you know that?

04:57.500 --> 04:58.800
A lot of people
don't know that.

04:58.800 --> 05:01.900
I wouldn't give a shit if they
ate the entire tree, but no,

05:01.900 --> 05:03.500
they fucking leave
it like a dick

05:03.500 --> 05:06.400
to fucking remind me that
they'll fucking eat me.

05:06.400 --> 05:10.600
Oh, fucking shut the fuck up!

05:10.600 --> 05:12.100
I swear to God
these fucking birds

05:12.100 --> 05:14.600

my shit all the time

05:14.600 --> 05:17.000

05:18.000 --> 05:21.700
Oh, God, eat my fucking...

05:21.700 --> 05:23.000

Sure.

05:23.800 --> 05:26.600
Come on, man, let's

05:30.600 --> 05:32.800
Come on.
Okay.

05:32.800 --> 05:34.100
Mike, it is good to see you.

05:34.100 --> 05:36.400
Seriously, I am glad you
got to see this place.

05:36.400 --> 05:38.800
It's a very special place to
me and you get to see it.

05:38.800 --> 05:39.800
I'm happy.

05:39.800 --> 05:42.000
Yeah, of course.

05:42.000 --> 05:44.700
Oh, God.

05:44.700 --> 05:46.500
You look, uh...

05:46.500 --> 05:48.800
You lost a, a ton of weight.

05:48.800 --> 05:51.100
Oh, yeah, I can

05:51.100 --> 05:54.800
Crack-kins,

05:56.800 --> 05:58.600
You've been busy.

05:58.600 --> 05:59.800
Fuck yeah I've been busy, man.

05:59.800 --> 06:00.900
The inspiration,
I'm telling you,

06:00.900 --> 06:04.000
it just fucking
flows through me

06:04.000 --> 06:06.500
like a river of...

06:06.500 --> 06:09.700
Crap, where's my fucking pipe?

06:11.700 --> 06:13.800
Okay.

06:13.800 --> 06:15.600
All right.

06:15.600 --> 06:18.100
Give me my pipe, dude.

06:18.100 --> 06:19.800
I don't have it.

06:19.800 --> 06:22.700
Mike, fuck you.

06:22.700 --> 06:24.500
Give me my fucking
pipe right now!

06:24.500 --> 06:26.700
I don't have your pipe.

06:26.700 --> 06:27.900
Mike, you fucking asshole!

06:27.900 --> 06:32.100
No, don't fucking judge me with
your shitty fucking eyes goddamnit.

06:32.100 --> 06:33.900
Really?

06:33.900 --> 06:35.400
It was the fucking birds.
You're right, I gotcha.

06:35.400 --> 06:37.700
Okay, here it comes.

06:37.700 --> 06:40.000
Shit! Godda... Oh,
fucking bullets.

06:40.000 --> 06:41.900
Out of fucking bullets!

06:41.900 --> 06:43.000
Goddammit, man!

06:43.000 --> 06:44.800
Chris, it's okay, man, all right?
I see your pipe.

06:44.800 --> 06:45.800
You see it?

06:45.800 --> 06:48.000
Yes, yes, it's outside, okay?

06:48.000 --> 06:50.800
I'm, I'm gonna go outside
and I'm gonna get it.

06:50.800 --> 06:52.200
Okay. I'm gonna bring
it back to you.

06:52.200 --> 06:53.200
Bring it back.

06:53.200 --> 06:55.000
Just have a seat on your
mattress and chill out.

06:55.000 --> 06:55.700
You're the boss.

06:55.700 --> 06:57.600
All right, I'll
be waiting here.

06:57.600 --> 06:58.300
All right.

06:58.300 --> 06:59.500
You're a good friend, Michael.

06:59.500 --> 07:01.200
Yeah.

07:01.200 --> 07:04.000
I'm sorry this had to happen
when you came to visit me.

07:04.000 --> 07:05.800
Oh.

07:05.800 --> 07:10.100
Oh, fuck Mike, you're
a fucking lifesaver.

07:10.100 --> 07:12.900
Oh, God.

07:15.900 --> 07:18.000
Oh, there we go.

07:25.000 --> 07:27.000
Oh, God.

07:28.000 --> 07:30.200
Fuck, man.

07:30.200 --> 07:31.300
That's a lot better, dude.

07:31.300 --> 07:33.500
Fuck, that was a close one.

07:33.500 --> 07:35.200
Oh, God.

07:40.200 --> 07:42.800
Sorry, man.

07:42.800 --> 07:44.600
For what?

07:48.600 --> 07:50.200
All right, look, I came here

07:50.200 --> 07:52.600
to ask you one last time.

07:52.600 --> 07:55.000
Can we get in my truck
and take you somewhere?

07:56.000 --> 07:57.900
Oh, come on, dude, no way, man.

07:57.900 --> 07:59.000
This...

07:59.100 --> 08:00.700
Mike this is my fucking
destiny, man, you know that.

08:00.700 --> 08:02.500
All I'm asking is
that you get clean

08:02.500 --> 08:03.700
for one week, okay?

08:03.700 --> 08:05.100
If after that you
want to go back

08:05.100 --> 08:07.000
to dying here, that's fine.

08:07.000 --> 08:07.500
No.

08:07.500 --> 08:09.700
No way.

08:09.700 --> 08:10.500
Okay.

08:10.500 --> 08:14.100
All right.

08:14.100 --> 08:15.100
Well, goodbye.

08:15.100 --> 08:16.700
What?

08:16.700 --> 08:17.700
Mike, don't fucking...

08:17.700 --> 08:20.100
Here, dude, don't leave.

08:20.100 --> 08:21.000
Finish your drink, man.

08:21.000 --> 08:23.300
Come on, sit down.

08:23.300 --> 08:25.700
Come on, finish your drink.

08:25.700 --> 08:28.800
Sit down, finish your
drink, talk to me.

08:30.800 --> 08:31.500
How's...

08:32.000 --> 08:32.700
How's your wife?

08:32.900 --> 08:36.000
How's, um... Jennifer. Jennifer.

08:36.000 --> 08:36.900
Is good.

08:36.900 --> 08:37.799
Jennifer's good, right?

08:37.799 --> 08:39.299
Okay, that's good.

08:39.299 --> 08:42.100
Is she still mad at
me about the wedding?

08:42.100 --> 08:43.100
Yes.

08:43.100 --> 08:43.799
Really?

08:43.799 --> 08:45.800
Yeah, actually, yeah, nobody,

08:45.800 --> 08:47.700
nobody really likes you
very much right now.

08:47.700 --> 08:50.000
Oh, that sucks.

08:50.000 --> 08:51.000
You can fix it.

08:52.000 --> 08:53.300
Oh, God, there's no...

08:53.300 --> 08:54.000
Do you remem...

08:54.000 --> 08:56.300
I don't think I can fix that.

08:56.300 --> 08:58.900
God.

09:01.900 --> 09:05.700
Oh God, Mike, I got
a fucking dog.

09:05.700 --> 09:06.500
Can you believe that?

09:06.500 --> 09:07.800
I finally got a fucking dog.

09:07.800 --> 09:09.700
It's so fucking awesome.

09:09.700 --> 09:11.200
She doesn't live here,

09:11.200 --> 09:13.100
but she visits me every day.

09:13.100 --> 09:15.300
We're, uh, we're writing
a book together

09:15.300 --> 09:17.100
on, uh, squirrels.

09:17.100 --> 09:18.200
Her idea.

09:18.200 --> 09:20.200
When's the last time you slept?

09:20.200 --> 09:21.200
Oh, fuck.

09:21.200 --> 09:25.300
Jeez, I don't know.

09:25.300 --> 09:26.800
Well, all right.

09:26.800 --> 09:27.300
Really?

09:27.300 --> 09:28.100
Yeah.

09:28.100 --> 09:30.000
You're leavin'?

09:30.000 --> 09:33.100
All right, man.

09:35.100 --> 09:39.200
In seven days the last
molecule of that shit

09:39.200 --> 09:40.200
will be leaving your body.

09:41.000 --> 09:44.000
After that, you wanna die,

09:44.000 --> 09:46.800
I will throw you the key,

09:46.800 --> 09:48.600
and you'll never see me again.

09:48.600 --> 09:50.300
Mike, what are ya doing?

09:50.300 --> 09:52.100
Mike, what the fuck?

09:52.100 --> 09:55.200
Look, I'm gonna,
I'm gonna go to the store.

09:55.200 --> 09:56.300
I'll be back in a half hour.

09:56.300 --> 09:57.900
Mike!

09:57.900 --> 09:59.400
Mike, fuck off!

09:59.400 --> 10:01.200
Mike, take this fucking off me

10:01.200 --> 10:02.300
right fucking now!

10:02.300 --> 10:03.200
Try and sleep it off.

10:03.200 --> 10:05.000
Michael!

10:05.000 --> 10:06.400
Fuck you, Mike!

10:06.400 --> 10:08.200
Are you fucking kidding me?

10:08.200 --> 10:09.400
Mike!

10:09.400 --> 10:09.900
Mike!

10:10.000 --> 10:11.900
Oh, my fucking God, Mike,

10:11.900 --> 10:13.400
you're a fucking dead man!

10:13.400 --> 10:16.200
Fucking let me out
of this fucking thing!

10:16.200 --> 10:17.400
Michael!

10:17.400 --> 10:20.200
Oh, fuck!

10:42.200 --> 10:43.200
I tried, there's no,

10:43.200 --> 10:45.700
there's no signal at the cabin.

10:45.700 --> 10:47.400
Yeah, he, uh, he
says he's gonna try.

10:47.400 --> 10:49.900
He was being
surprisingly agreeable.

10:49.900 --> 10:53.000
So...

10:53.000 --> 10:56.100
Yeah, I know, it is a miracle.

11:02.100 --> 11:03.300
I know, I know, there're much

11:03.300 --> 11:05.200
bigger responsibilities.

11:10.200 --> 11:11.400
Well, hey.

11:11.400 --> 11:13.700
Well, hi, where'd
you come from?

11:13.700 --> 11:15.800
What's your name?

11:15.800 --> 11:18.900
Hey.

11:18.900 --> 11:20.200
Hi.

11:20.200 --> 11:21.100
Hi.

11:25.100 --> 11:26.100
Pretty dog.

11:26.100 --> 11:27.000
Hey.

11:31.000 --> 11:32.400
Where'd you get that?

11:32.400 --> 11:34.200
My pocket.

11:34.200 --> 11:38.300
I don't want my
teeth to fall out.

11:38.300 --> 11:42.200
Michael, when you were gone

11:42.200 --> 11:46.100
I took a long, hard
look at myself.

11:46.100 --> 11:48.300
You're right.

11:48.300 --> 11:50.500
I'm pretty fucked up.

11:50.500 --> 11:53.200
I need to go to rehab.

11:53.200 --> 11:55.200
I'm ready, man.

11:55.200 --> 11:59.800
I'm ready for you
to take me to rehab.

11:59.800 --> 12:01.300
Let's do this.

12:01.300 --> 12:05.300
Uncuff me.

12:05.300 --> 12:06.300
What are you doing?

12:06.300 --> 12:08.300
Why are you doing that?

12:08.300 --> 12:11.800
Mike, let me out
of the fucking cuffs.

12:11.800 --> 12:15.500
Do you know why
Jimi Hendrix died?

12:15.500 --> 12:17.200
He didn't have Mike Danube

12:17.200 --> 12:19.400
and a set of handcuffs
to save his life.

12:19.400 --> 12:21.400
Here, you're gonna need
water and calories.

12:21.400 --> 12:22.300
It's an empty bag anyway.

12:22.300 --> 12:24.200
Hey, I found someone
you know outside.

12:24.200 --> 12:25.100
Are Billy and Micah outside?

12:25.100 --> 12:27.100
No, you still talk
to those degenerates?

12:27.100 --> 12:30.300
They're my drug dealers.

12:30.300 --> 12:32.500
Oh my God, Sara!

12:32.500 --> 12:34.000
Kill Mike.

12:34.000 --> 12:35.000
Kill Mike, Sara.

12:35.000 --> 12:36.400
I found an address on her tags.

12:36.400 --> 12:38.800
I should probably take
her back to her owner.

12:38.800 --> 12:40.300
Oh yeah, great idea, Mike.

12:40.300 --> 12:41.800
Take away the only thing
in life that keeps me

12:41.800 --> 12:44.200
from killing myself.

12:49.200 --> 12:51.400
She has a really
good imagination.

12:51.400 --> 12:53.800
Hey, some ointment
for your wrist.

12:53.800 --> 12:55.300
I'm gonna fire up some
chili, you want some?

12:55.300 --> 12:57.400
Does it got crack
in it, motherfucker?

12:57.400 --> 13:00.300
Okay, at least drink something.

13:00.300 --> 13:03.000
I read that the dehydration
will only make this worse.

13:04.000 --> 13:06.000
Thank you for this.

13:06.000 --> 13:07.400
I appreciate it.

13:42.400 --> 13:46.500
Please, Michael.

13:46.500 --> 13:49.000
Please.

13:50.000 --> 13:53.100
I need it.

13:53.100 --> 13:55.500
Please, Michael.

13:57.500 --> 14:01.400
Please, Michael.

14:01.400 --> 14:04.500
Please.

14:04.500 --> 14:08.500
I need it, Michael.

14:08.500 --> 14:12.300
Please.

14:12.300 --> 14:16.200
Please, Michael.

14:16.200 --> 14:20.300
I need it.

14:20.300 --> 14:24.100
Please.

14:24.100 --> 14:28.200
Please, Mike.

14:28.200 --> 14:32.200
I need it, Mike.

14:32.200 --> 14:35.400
Please.

14:35.400 --> 14:39.100
Please, Mike.

14:39.100 --> 14:40.600
Please, Michael.

15:10.600 --> 15:12.700
Give me the fucking key, Mike!

15:12.700 --> 15:14.300
Give me the fucking key, man!

15:14.300 --> 15:16.700
Fuck!

15:16.700 --> 15:18.900
Oh... Oh.

15:22.400 --> 15:24.600
Fuck.

15:26.600 --> 15:28.600
Oh.

15:31.600 --> 15:33.500
Oh.

15:45.500 --> 15:47.700
Oh, God.

15:56.700 --> 15:59.000
Wake up you little bitch.

15:59.000 --> 16:00.600
Yo, come out, don't be
keeping all that stuff

16:00.600 --> 16:03.700
for your dirty
carpet mining self.

16:05.700 --> 16:07.600
Oh, shit!

16:07.600 --> 16:09.400
Mike Danube and shit.

16:09.400 --> 16:11.700
Fuck, what up, dog?

16:11.700 --> 16:14.000
I didn't know you
was into chicken?

16:14.000 --> 16:18.500
Where's Chris?

16:18.500 --> 16:20.600
Yo, Chris!

16:20.600 --> 16:23.500
Chris!

16:23.500 --> 16:25.500
He all whooped already?

16:25.500 --> 16:27.100
No, he's, uh, he's sick

16:27.100 --> 16:28.600
and he's taking a break,

16:28.600 --> 16:29.700
but I'll, uh, I'll let him know

16:29.700 --> 16:32.500
you guys stopped by.

16:32.500 --> 16:33.600
Y'all are getting all spracked

16:33.600 --> 16:34.700
on our shit in there, huh?

16:34.700 --> 16:35.600
You tell him, dog.

16:35.600 --> 16:38.600
Yeah.

16:38.600 --> 16:39.600
Use that shit.

16:39.600 --> 16:43.700
I fucking dare you.

16:43.700 --> 16:45.500
Come on.

16:45.500 --> 16:48.500
All right then.

16:48.500 --> 16:52.700
Now I see how it is.

16:52.700 --> 16:56.500
Yo, Chris,

16:56.500 --> 16:58.300
we're gonna come back
later go fishing.

16:58.300 --> 17:00.100
I'm telling you, motherfucker.

17:00.100 --> 17:01.300
If we don't get
that blue belly,

17:01.300 --> 17:05.500
we're gonna have
some problems, yo.

17:05.500 --> 17:07.700
Fucking cunt.

17:10.700 --> 17:11.400
Faggot.

17:13.400 --> 17:14.599
Oh, what the fuck?

17:14.599 --> 17:16.599
Are you fucking dealing?

17:16.599 --> 17:18.400
I wish I was fucking dealing.

17:18.400 --> 17:21.500
What's the gun for?

17:21.500 --> 17:22.700
Protection.

17:22.700 --> 17:25.599
Protection from what?

17:25.599 --> 17:26.300
The birds.

17:26.300 --> 17:28.600
Okay, there are
no birds, Chris.

17:28.600 --> 17:31.500
You have meth psychosis.

17:33.500 --> 17:34.600
The gray man.

17:34.600 --> 17:36.600
The gray man, yes of course.

17:36.600 --> 17:38.500
Mike, the government
issues each

17:38.500 --> 17:39.800
and every one of us
a shadow man.

17:39.800 --> 17:41.500
Billy and Micah stopped by.

17:41.500 --> 17:42.700
Billy and Micah are fucked up.

17:42.700 --> 17:43.800
Don't fuck with
those guys, dude.

17:43.800 --> 17:45.800
You know, I never thought
that you would end up

17:45.800 --> 17:46.600
as bad as them.

17:46.600 --> 17:47.800
I fucking...

17:47.800 --> 17:49.600
I'm kidnapped, asshole,
and you're jud...

17:49.600 --> 17:52.100
You're a self-righteous
asshole!

17:52.100 --> 17:53.700
They said that you have
something of theirs.

17:53.700 --> 17:56.200
God.

17:56.200 --> 17:58.400
All right, man, fucking
last fucking month

17:58.400 --> 18:00.500
my check didn't come
and fucking so they

18:00.600 --> 18:02.200
shared with me.

18:02.200 --> 18:04.600
Oh, God.

18:04.600 --> 18:06.600
Provided I just fucking
pay 'em back this month.

18:06.600 --> 18:08.200
Okay.

18:08.200 --> 18:10.500
Where is it?

18:10.500 --> 18:12.800
You found it already.

18:12.800 --> 18:16.200
The rest of it.

18:16.200 --> 18:18.300
Okay.

18:18.300 --> 18:21.900
Come on, dude, you know I'm
gonna find it eventually.

18:31.900 --> 18:33.700
Mike, please just
give me a hit of it.

18:33.700 --> 18:36.700
Mike, seriously.

18:36.700 --> 18:38.600
Mike, I...

18:38.600 --> 18:40.300
I know I sound ridiculous
'cause you hear...

18:40.300 --> 18:44.700
Just plea...
Just I... You don't just go cold turkey.

19:44.800 --> 19:47.700
What'd you do with it?

19:47.700 --> 19:49.600
Mike, you can't fuck around
with this stuff, man.

19:49.600 --> 19:50.800
I didn't do anything, okay?

19:50.800 --> 19:51.600
I just picked this stuff up

19:51.600 --> 19:53.600
and I brought it straight here.

19:53.600 --> 19:54.900
There was nothing
else down there?

19:54.900 --> 19:57.400
No, just a shitload of guns,

19:57.400 --> 20:00.000
that box, and these
like a little story.

20:00.000 --> 20:01.600
Mike, this is not good, man.

20:01.600 --> 20:03.700
Look, I know right
now it probably feels

20:03.700 --> 20:05.800
like you're not gonna make it,
but you're gonna be all right.

20:05.800 --> 20:09.500
Oh God, I owe Micah and Billy.

20:09.500 --> 20:12.300
They're not the same guys
from high school, Mike.

20:12.300 --> 20:14.400
I saw Billy hit a girl so hard

20:14.500 --> 20:16.900
her fucking eyeball popped
out of her fucking head.

20:16.900 --> 20:18.800
What are these?

20:18.800 --> 20:21.700
They're fucking
some photos I found

20:21.700 --> 20:24.000
by the stone house.

20:24.000 --> 20:25.800
I was gonna sell 'em
at the flea market.

20:25.800 --> 20:27.800
And they were just
lying there in the dirt?

20:27.800 --> 20:29.600
You find all kinds
of shit out here.

20:29.600 --> 20:32.800
People do rituals.

20:32.800 --> 20:33.800
So, you've got government

20:34.000 --> 20:36.300
and devil worshipper problems?

20:36.300 --> 20:37.600
I'm really fucking tired, Mike.

20:38.000 --> 20:40.900
This is probably the point

20:40.900 --> 20:44.300
where you're gonna wanna
sleep for a few days.

20:44.300 --> 20:49.100
Oh, God, fuck off.

20:49.100 --> 20:50.800
I'm going for a walk.

21:12.800 --> 21:14.300
That's exactly what
Jedediah was saying

21:14.300 --> 21:17.900
about the metamorphosis
of the tadpole.

21:17.900 --> 21:20.000
Hey, how's it going, man?

21:20.000 --> 21:21.300
Good, thanks.

21:21.300 --> 21:23.400
Right on, right on.

21:23.400 --> 21:26.800
Hey, uh, if you
don't me asking,

21:26.800 --> 21:29.800
what, uh, what are
you doing out here?

21:29.800 --> 21:33.400
Oh, I'm, uh, just
visiting my friend.

21:33.400 --> 21:34.900
Very cool, very cool.

21:34.900 --> 21:36.500
The only reason I'm
asking is that we come

21:36.500 --> 21:38.500
out here just about
every day after prayer

21:38.500 --> 21:40.700
and we never see anyone ever.

21:40.700 --> 21:41.900
So, this is awesome.

21:41.900 --> 21:43.900
I'm Justin.

21:43.900 --> 21:45.800
Um, hi.

21:45.800 --> 21:47.900
I'm, I'm Michael.

21:47.900 --> 21:49.700
Michael, it's fantastic
to meet you.

21:49.700 --> 21:50.900
This is David.

21:50.900 --> 21:51.400
Hi.

21:51.400 --> 21:53.900
And this is Aaron.

21:53.900 --> 21:56.800
- How ya doing, brother?
- Good.

21:56.800 --> 21:58.900
Yeah.

21:58.900 --> 22:01.400
So, you guys are like
in a church group?

22:01.400 --> 22:02.600
Basically, basically.

22:02.600 --> 22:05.800
Our whole thing is just making
sure that people know that

22:05.800 --> 22:07.400
the celestial Messiah
will land his vessel

22:08.000 --> 22:12.000
before the end of days.

23:15.000 --> 23:17.100
Why are you freaking out?

23:47.100 --> 23:47.800
Fuck!

23:47.900 --> 23:49.000
Holy shit!

23:49.000 --> 23:50.500
Holy shit!

23:50.500 --> 23:51.900
What, what's happening?

23:51.900 --> 23:52.900
There's somebody outside.

23:53.000 --> 23:54.600
Do they have my stuff?

23:54.600 --> 23:55.900
No, it's some girl.

23:55.900 --> 23:59.100
She looks crazy,
or sick, or some shit.

23:59.100 --> 24:01.800
Oh, God.

24:01.800 --> 24:02.900
You're not scared?

24:02.900 --> 24:08.100
No, man, she's probably from the new
age mental health house up the street.

24:08.100 --> 24:10.000
They wander out all the time.

24:11.000 --> 24:12.200
Oh.

24:25.200 --> 24:26.900
Rise and shine, cunts!

24:26.900 --> 24:28.600
Oh, fuck.

24:31.600 --> 24:32.800
Give me my gun, Mike.

24:32.800 --> 24:34.600
Mike, don't leave
here without a gun.

24:34.600 --> 24:36.100
Mike, don't be stupid.

24:36.100 --> 24:37.700
Fuck.

24:37.700 --> 24:40.100
Just give me the crizzy
and we'll bounce.

24:40.200 --> 24:43.200
Look, Billy, we don't
have your shit, okay?

24:43.200 --> 24:45.700
Look, Chris either smoked
it all or he lost it,

24:45.700 --> 24:48.000
I don't know, but I can
write you a check right now

24:48.000 --> 24:49.700
for whatever he owes you

24:49.700 --> 24:50.800
if you'd be willing
to call it even.

24:50.800 --> 24:52.100
No, fuck that shit.

24:52.100 --> 24:53.700
Come on, Chris, give me
the fucking twizz, bitch.

24:53.700 --> 24:55.200
Fuck you, Billy! I
don't owe you shit.

24:55.200 --> 24:58.100
Shut the fuck up!

24:58.100 --> 25:01.100
Look, Bill, I will give
you more than enough money

25:01.100 --> 25:02.900
to buy some more, okay?

25:02.900 --> 25:04.300
- Billy.
- Yeah?

25:04.300 --> 25:06.200
Someone's coming
up the hill, dog.

25:06.200 --> 25:07.700
All right, fuck you.

25:07.700 --> 25:09.900
Fuck you, Danube.

25:12.900 --> 25:14.000
What are you doing here?

25:14.000 --> 25:16.300
I'm, uh, I'm just
visiting my friend.

25:16.300 --> 25:18.600
Yeah, what the fuck's
your friend doing here?

25:18.600 --> 25:19.900
Hey, Mike, who is that?

25:19.900 --> 25:22.000
Don't let 'em know I'm in here.

25:22.000 --> 25:24.100
I'm, uh, Michael.

25:24.100 --> 25:26.700
Charles.

25:26.700 --> 25:27.700
Is there a problem?

25:27.700 --> 25:31.200
Yeah, there's a problem.
This is my goddamn building.

25:31.200 --> 25:33.900
Oh, so Chris, Chris
didn't pay his rent?

25:33.900 --> 25:36.100
Who the fuck is Chris?

25:36.100 --> 25:37.300
Shit.

25:37.300 --> 25:42.000
Look, um, I'm trying to get him out
of here and I need less than a week.

25:42.000 --> 25:45.000
Is there anyway we can
work something out?

25:45.000 --> 25:46.900
Well, that would be impossible.

25:46.900 --> 25:51.100
See, that's
the reservation border.

25:51.100 --> 25:52.600
We're on a reservation?

25:52.600 --> 25:57.100
You need tribal council
approval to stay here.

25:57.100 --> 25:59.100
Okay, look, um,

25:59.100 --> 26:01.200
how 'bout I write
you a check right now

26:01.200 --> 26:03.800
and five days from now you will
never know we were even here?

26:03.800 --> 26:05.100
Are you serious?

26:05.100 --> 26:08.000
Yeah.

26:08.000 --> 26:10.200
Tell you what.

26:10.200 --> 26:13.100
To bring me cash tomorrow

26:13.100 --> 26:16.900
you call this number.

26:19.900 --> 26:22.200
And I want this place
cleaned up in five days.

26:22.200 --> 26:23.100
Do you understand me?

26:23.100 --> 26:26.100
I do.

26:26.100 --> 26:28.400
A lot of drug addicts
buried in these hills,

26:28.400 --> 26:30.800
you know that?

26:41.800 --> 26:42.600
You're squatting.

26:42.600 --> 26:43.700
You're squatting.

26:43.700 --> 26:46.100
<i>No, man, we're squatting.</i>

26:46.100 --> 26:51.900
I mean, don't you get money from
welfare, or unemployment, or something?

26:51.900 --> 26:52.800
Well, the owner was out there.

26:52.800 --> 26:54.900
Billy and Micah are
coming back, Mike.

26:54.900 --> 26:56.100
You never know when
but they always come back,

26:56.100 --> 26:57.800
and they're gonna
fucking kill us.

26:57.800 --> 27:01.000
Oh, and did you know you're
on an Indian reservation?

27:01.000 --> 27:02.400
How the fuck am
I supposed to know

27:02.400 --> 27:05.200
what an Indian reservation is
or what private property is?

27:05.200 --> 27:07.100
Check a map you fucking idiot.

27:07.100 --> 27:08.400
I'm a fucking junkie, Mike.

27:08.400 --> 27:09.700
I move every two weeks when

27:09.700 --> 27:11.400
I'm not fucking
chained to a pipe.

27:11.400 --> 27:13.000
Do you have any idea
what tribal security

27:13.000 --> 27:15.800
would do to us if they
caught us here?

27:15.800 --> 27:17.000
Whatever they want.
Yeah.

27:17.000 --> 27:18.300
Yeah, okay, so
fucking uncuff me.

27:18.300 --> 27:19.800
Let's get the fuck out of here.

27:19.800 --> 27:21.000
No, I'm gonna pay
'em for five days.

27:21.000 --> 27:22.700
What?
We'll be fine.

27:22.900 --> 27:25.900
Well, I hope you got a good fucking
deal 'cause this place really sucks.

27:25.900 --> 27:26.800
What is that smell?

27:26.800 --> 27:28.100
I shit in the bucket.

29:05.900 --> 29:08.300
The man said that
it was worth more,

29:08.300 --> 29:10.500
wouldn't do that to you.

29:10.500 --> 29:13.400
Where's the rest?

29:13.400 --> 29:16.400
There isn't any more.

29:16.400 --> 29:19.400
I'm not lying to you.

29:19.400 --> 29:21.000
What is that?

29:22.000 --> 29:23.000
No!

29:23.000 --> 29:24.300
God, please!

29:24.300 --> 29:25.900
Please!

29:25.900 --> 29:27.400
Please!

29:27.400 --> 29:28.400
Please!

30:15.400 --> 30:17.100
What was that?

30:17.100 --> 30:18.900
Some weird story.

30:18.900 --> 30:19.800
Yeah.

30:19.800 --> 30:23.400
Well, the air weighs
a billion pounds

30:23.400 --> 30:27.400
and I itch all over still.

30:27.400 --> 30:29.500
Hey, where did you
find those pictures?

30:29.500 --> 30:32.400
Told ya, man, by that
stone house thing.

30:32.400 --> 30:33.500
Near the stove thing?

30:33.500 --> 30:35.900
Yeah.

30:35.900 --> 30:38.100
There's a weird record
with a story in there.

30:38.100 --> 30:40.200
There's weird shit
everywhere, man.

30:40.200 --> 30:43.300
There's some weird
tires by the river.

30:43.300 --> 30:44.900
Why don't you grab that?

30:44.900 --> 30:47.000
Why'd you send me the video?

30:47.000 --> 30:48.300
I didn't send you a video.

30:48.300 --> 30:50.300
Yeah, you did.

30:50.300 --> 30:52.500
The link you emailed me.

30:52.500 --> 30:55.300
Mike, do you see a computer
or a camera around here, man?

30:55.300 --> 30:57.100
I sold all that shit

30:57.100 --> 31:01.400
a year ago to shitty Carl.

31:01.400 --> 31:03.500
What are ya, gonna surround me?

31:03.500 --> 31:05.100
Oh!

31:05.100 --> 31:06.900
I don't think I sent you that.

31:06.900 --> 31:09.400
Yeah, you sent it
to me with a map.

31:09.400 --> 31:12.500
Look, dude, you haven't
slept in like two days

31:12.500 --> 31:15.200
and my brain is
fucked, obviously,

31:15.200 --> 31:17.400
so why don't you uncuff me

31:17.400 --> 31:20.900
before you go crazy?

31:20.900 --> 31:25.400
Yeah, you're right,
I need sleep.

32:00.100 --> 32:02.500
Hey, I found this library
book on our doorstep.

32:02.500 --> 32:04.200
Oh, that's fantastic.

32:04.200 --> 32:05.300
Do you wanna uncuff me now?

32:05.300 --> 32:06.200
It's cool.

32:06.200 --> 32:08.700
It's like a collection of
fiction writing or something.

32:08.700 --> 32:11.100
God, my legs are
starting to cramp up.

32:11.100 --> 32:13.200
There's a bunch of like
campfire ghost stories.

32:13.200 --> 32:14.500
It's a...

32:14.500 --> 32:17.700
Oh God, they're really
starting to hurt.

32:17.700 --> 32:19.200
Hey, I'm gonna go pay that guy.

32:19.200 --> 32:22.000
Do you need anything?

32:22.000 --> 32:25.100
Yeah, some food would be good.

32:25.100 --> 32:27.100
Uh...

32:37.100 --> 32:40.100
Can you hand it to me, man?
I can barely fucking move.

32:45.100 --> 32:47.600
There. Thank you.

32:56.600 --> 33:01.300
Just fucking kill me, man.

33:01.300 --> 33:03.600
Seriously, just fucking
grab a gun and kill me.

33:03.600 --> 33:04.700
Look, Chris, I'm obviously

33:04.700 --> 33:06.700
I'm not an expert, okay,

33:06.700 --> 33:08.600
but I read that this
is normal, okay?

33:08.600 --> 33:10.800
You're gonna feel weak, and
you're gonna feel helpless,

33:10.800 --> 33:12.100
but eventually,
little by little,

33:12.100 --> 33:15.300
you will get better.

33:15.300 --> 33:16.700
I'm not gonna fucking
be able to do this, man.

33:16.700 --> 33:17.500
Yes, you can.

33:17.500 --> 33:18.400
Yes, you can.

33:18.400 --> 33:19.000
Trust me on this.

33:19.000 --> 33:22.400
You can do this, okay?

33:22.400 --> 33:23.500
You have my word
you're not gonna die.

33:23.500 --> 33:24.500
Fuck.

33:24.500 --> 33:27.100
Just fucking kill me.

33:35.100 --> 33:35.600
Hey.

33:35.700 --> 33:37.800
Hey.

33:43.800 --> 33:46.100
You have four days.

33:46.100 --> 33:48.800
Got it, thank you.

33:48.800 --> 33:52.500
Um, hey, hey, Charles?

33:52.500 --> 33:55.300
My sincerest apologizes
on behalf of both of us.

33:55.300 --> 33:56.200
It doesn't matter.

33:56.200 --> 33:57.700
If I were you, I'd leave.

33:57.700 --> 34:00.700
Ain't nothing you
can do for him.

34:00.700 --> 34:06.100
Hey, can I ask you
a quick question?

34:06.100 --> 34:07.800
With all due respect, um,

34:07.800 --> 34:09.500
why is no one living
in the place?

34:09.500 --> 34:14.100
I mean, why not, you know,
finish it off and rent it?

34:14.100 --> 34:15.600
We rent it out
to tribal members

34:15.600 --> 34:16.800
but it got burnt in the fires.

34:16.800 --> 34:21.300
We couldn't afford to rebuild.

34:21.300 --> 34:24.600
I'm sorry to hear that.

34:24.600 --> 34:26.300
Thank you again.

34:29.300 --> 34:30.300
Hi.

35:00.300 --> 35:04.200
So, these are just
there in its place?

35:04.200 --> 35:05.400
Yeah, it's bizarre, right?

35:05.400 --> 35:07.700
No, I don't care.

35:21.700 --> 35:25.200
Another story with
a fucked up ending.

35:27.200 --> 35:28.800
What do you think?

35:28.800 --> 35:30.600
About what?

35:30.600 --> 35:33.700
Do you think someone's leaving
these stories for us to find?

35:33.700 --> 35:36.300
I think people leave
their shit everywhere

35:36.300 --> 35:39.400
and you fucking
take it personally.

35:39.400 --> 35:41.700
I don't know, Billy and Micah?

35:41.700 --> 35:43.300
The chick in the window?
I don't know, the fucking dog?

35:43.300 --> 35:48.200
Like why would somebody be
leaving stuff for us to find?

35:48.300 --> 35:49.700
I don't fucking know, Mike.

35:49.700 --> 35:52.700
Who gives a shit, man?

35:52.700 --> 35:54.700
I got bigger fucking
problems than your

35:54.700 --> 35:57.700
fucking faggot recordings.

36:14.700 --> 36:16.900
Seriously?

36:16.900 --> 36:19.700
Alcohol has never
been your problem.

36:19.700 --> 36:20.800
Actually, no, I won't say that.

36:20.800 --> 36:22.700
If you have problems
when you drink,

36:22.700 --> 36:26.300
you have a drinking problem.

36:26.300 --> 36:28.800
What the fuck are
you talking about?

36:28.800 --> 36:33.700
Denise "The Beast" Price.

36:33.700 --> 36:35.700
Why you gotta
bring up old shit?

36:35.700 --> 36:38.600
She's easily the fattest girl,

36:38.600 --> 36:40.900
I think, that has ever
walked the planet.

36:40.900 --> 36:43.800
I was wasted, man.

36:43.800 --> 36:45.700
I literally saw her
eat an entire block

36:45.700 --> 36:48.400
of Velveeta cheese
in one sitting.

36:48.400 --> 36:50.800
We were making nachos
and the stove was broken.

36:50.800 --> 36:54.300
There's no excuse
for that, dude.

36:54.300 --> 36:56.800
You had sex with
"Grody" Jody Jenkins.

36:56.800 --> 36:57.500
I was in college.

36:58.000 --> 36:59.600
I was hammered.

36:59.600 --> 37:01.700
She looked like John Madden.

37:01.700 --> 37:02.600
No way.

37:02.600 --> 37:05.600
Oh, yeah, she was
a punisher of eyes.

37:05.600 --> 37:06.900
Well, it's not as
bad as the hogs

37:07.000 --> 37:08.600
that Dale used
to bang, remember?

37:08.600 --> 37:10.700
Oh, man, Dale was the man

37:10.700 --> 37:11.900
'cause he owned it, you know?

37:12.000 --> 37:13.400
He had an opinion,

37:13.400 --> 37:14.900
he didn't care, and he
just went for it.

37:14.900 --> 37:17.800
He didn't give a shit who
fucking cared about it.

37:17.800 --> 37:18.400
To Dale.

37:18.400 --> 37:19.400
To Dale.

37:35.400 --> 37:36.700
Chris.

37:36.700 --> 37:39.700
Oh my God, I feel like shit.

37:39.700 --> 37:42.000
But in a different way.

37:42.000 --> 37:46.400
Where did this come from?

37:46.400 --> 37:48.700
You were looking at
it when you passed out.

37:48.700 --> 37:50.000
I was?

37:50.000 --> 37:52.900
No, I have no idea.

38:44.900 --> 38:47.900
Well, I mean, you know,
it's hard to tell.

38:47.900 --> 38:50.100
Um, you know, we'll have
to see after, you know,

38:50.100 --> 38:51.900
we get back, but, uh,

38:51.900 --> 38:55.000
yeah, I'm, uh, I'm
really optimistic.

38:56.000 --> 39:00.400
Well, yeah, I mean, I'm
going a little stir crazy

39:00.400 --> 39:03.600
and I miss you a lot.

39:03.600 --> 39:05.900
How ya feeling?

39:05.900 --> 39:09.400
Yeah, but I mean it's
just the mornings, right?

39:09.400 --> 39:12.100
Okay, well then, yeah,
I guess you better

39:12.100 --> 39:14.100
tend to that.

39:14.100 --> 39:16.900
I love ya.

40:02.600 --> 40:04.500
Can I go down to the
stream and wash off?

40:04.500 --> 40:06.600
Nope.

40:06.600 --> 40:08.000
Can I change my clothes?

40:08.000 --> 40:11.500
I'm not changing mine.

40:11.500 --> 40:13.500
Man, you have no faith in me.

40:13.500 --> 40:15.600
Look, if that were the case,

40:15.600 --> 40:16.800
I wouldn't be here.

40:16.800 --> 40:20.200
I just, uh, don't have very
much faith in you right now.

40:20.200 --> 40:22.900
Yeah, likewise.

40:22.900 --> 40:26.000
- What are you talking about?
- You know what I'm fucking talking about.

40:26.000 --> 40:27.500
Dude, you keep coming
here with these

40:27.500 --> 40:29.600
shitty recordings
and these stupid stories

40:29.600 --> 40:32.000
about how you found 'em, and
you're fucking acting weird.

40:32.000 --> 40:32.700
I'm...

40:33.000 --> 40:34.500
Okay, I'm not like making

40:34.500 --> 40:35.900
this shit up, all right?

40:35.900 --> 40:38.100
I think someone might
be messing with us.

40:38.100 --> 40:40.200
Maybe you have a...

40:40.200 --> 40:41.700
split personalities
and you're leaving

40:42.000 --> 40:44.500
each other gifts
and shit for you to find.

40:44.500 --> 40:45.900
Do you want some water?

40:45.900 --> 40:49.200
No, I'm good.

40:49.300 --> 40:53.900
Oh, great, more shitty
fucking recordings.

40:58.900 --> 41:00.000
You fucking...

41:00.000 --> 41:02.700
Ah-h-h!

41:04.700 --> 41:07.900
That's impossible.

41:07.900 --> 41:10.900
That could be fucking filmed
from right outside the window.

41:10.900 --> 41:13.800
Then where's, uh,
where's the glare?

41:13.800 --> 41:15.100
Okay, where's,
where's the glass

41:15.100 --> 41:16.900
if it's outside the window?

41:16.900 --> 41:18.900
It's not fucking HD,
Mike, it's dog shit.

41:18.900 --> 41:23.900
That could be filmed from right
outside the fucking window.

41:23.900 --> 41:25.300
What, you think it's
Billy and Micah?

41:26.000 --> 41:27.900
I think some fucking
kids up the street

41:27.900 --> 41:30.000
are just fucking with ya.

41:30.000 --> 41:31.000
You really think so?

41:31.000 --> 41:32.600
Mike, I don't...

41:32.600 --> 41:34.100
I'm fucking starving, Mike,

41:34.100 --> 41:35.900
and if you don't stop
talking about this

41:35.900 --> 41:38.000
goddamn shitty
recording business

41:38.000 --> 41:41.200
and fucking start preparing us some
food, I'm gonna fucking strangle myself

41:41.200 --> 41:42.700
with my fucking shoelaces, man.

41:42.700 --> 41:45.900
I swear to God.

41:45.900 --> 41:49.000
Make me beans,
or food, or something.

41:49.000 --> 41:50.700
Yeah, I'll pick up
some stuff for dinner.

41:50.700 --> 41:52.100
Oh, God, thank you.

41:52.100 --> 41:54.000
Do you want me to go with you?

42:28.000 --> 42:30.700
Hey, could I, uh,

42:30.700 --> 42:34.800
could I talk to you
for a second?

42:34.800 --> 42:35.500
Thank you.

42:35.500 --> 42:36.700
You need to be out of there.

42:36.700 --> 42:39.200
No, I know, I just wanted
to ask you about something.

42:39.200 --> 42:42.100
There's a, there's
a shed down the hill

42:42.100 --> 42:43.800
from your place,
do you know why

42:43.800 --> 42:45.900
there's a bunch of playback
equipment in it?

42:45.900 --> 42:48.100
Shouldn't be in there.

42:52.100 --> 42:55.800
I found this journal in there and it was
written all in French, and I was...

42:55.800 --> 42:59.800
Yeah, yeah, we rented it out to a bunch
of French students to research something.

42:59.800 --> 43:02.300
You need to leave.

43:02.300 --> 43:07.200
Did you talk to them?

43:07.200 --> 43:11.800
They said they were
researching folktales.

43:11.800 --> 43:14.200
That's it?

43:14.200 --> 43:16.600
They didn't say anything else?

43:21.600 --> 43:25.400
They asked a lot
about the caverns.

43:26.400 --> 43:28.200
All right, thank you.

43:28.200 --> 43:30.000
We're coming in two days.

43:33.000 --> 43:35.200
I think obviously
we need a kitchen,

43:35.200 --> 43:36.200
some granite countertops.

43:36.200 --> 43:37.900
Of course, granite's probably

43:37.900 --> 43:41.200
not gonna pencil out,

43:41.200 --> 43:42.300
but the thing is it's your

43:42.300 --> 43:44.200
God-given right
to be happy.

43:44.200 --> 43:46.300
Oh, hey, you must be Mike.

43:46.300 --> 43:47.800
Mike, Ted, Ted Tellensworth.

43:47.800 --> 43:48.500
How ya doing?

43:48.500 --> 43:49.900
I was just telling Chris here

43:49.900 --> 43:53.100
how it looks the wool's been pulled
over our collective eyes, so to speak.

43:53.100 --> 43:54.700
Mm-hm.

43:54.700 --> 43:57.700
Oh, we're not
interested in, um,

43:57.700 --> 43:58.300
I'm, I'm Catholic.

43:58.300 --> 43:59.700
I understand.

43:59.700 --> 44:03.200
California, bless their liberal
bedwettin' ACLU card carrying hearts,

44:03.200 --> 44:05.100
allowed you two newly weds to
consummate your bond.

44:05.200 --> 44:07.300
Then you guys move into this
place after some wheeling, dealing,

44:07.300 --> 44:09.700
dickhead mortgage broker
sells you guys an Option ARM

44:09.700 --> 44:11.900
with a NegAm balloon payment.

44:11.900 --> 44:14.200
No kids, expendable
incomes turned out to be

44:14.200 --> 44:17.900
a real financial
nightmare for you guys.

44:17.900 --> 44:19.300
You guys just want
to feel right again.

44:19.300 --> 44:20.900
No, okay, we're not...

44:20.900 --> 44:24.100
Mike, I'm not here to decide who's
the cub and who's the bear.

44:24.100 --> 44:25.700
What I am here to tell ya,

44:25.700 --> 44:29.300
that cash out loan the bank's
tellin' ya isn't possible?

44:29.300 --> 44:32.200
Right here in this briefcase.

44:32.200 --> 44:34.900
That whole "We buy
houses for cash"

44:34.900 --> 44:35.900
I'm that guy.

44:35.900 --> 44:36.900
He's that guy, Mike.

44:36.900 --> 44:39.000
Ted, tell him how much
we could probably get.

44:39.000 --> 44:40.200
Hold your horses, sunshine.

44:40.200 --> 44:42.800
The thing is, I'm gonna need
to see some loan paperwork,

44:42.800 --> 44:45.000
maybe a deed, whatever
you guys have on hand,

44:45.000 --> 44:46.200
and we could probably
work this thing out.

44:46.200 --> 44:47.100
Mike, we have that right?

44:47.100 --> 44:48.800
Why don't you just
give us a retainer now...

44:48.800 --> 44:51.400
Wait, wait. So, you're
a mortgage broker?

44:51.400 --> 44:54.700
Uh, Michael, let's just say what I
used to be able to do on the phones,

44:54.700 --> 44:57.300
probably served better in this
economy going door to door.

44:57.300 --> 44:59.100
So, you're not
a mortgage broker.

44:59.100 --> 45:01.200
You guys are obviously
doing what you guys do.

45:01.200 --> 45:03.100
I do what it is I do.

45:03.100 --> 45:05.200
Nobody talks about maybe
what we can do together,

45:05.200 --> 45:06.400
and, uh, if we do
this thing right,

45:06.400 --> 45:07.400
we trust each other,

45:07.400 --> 45:10.200
we could probably all
profit from this thing.

45:10.200 --> 45:12.500
We're renting.

45:12.500 --> 45:13.400
I'll be damned.

45:13.400 --> 45:15.100
Of course you two are.

45:15.100 --> 45:18.100
Chris, admittedly, I'm
a little bit embarrassed.

45:18.100 --> 45:20.300
Sorry for wasting
your guys' time.

45:23.300 --> 45:25.100
Oh, and, um, Michael,

45:25.100 --> 45:27.000
I'd hate to have either
one of our businesses

45:28.000 --> 45:32.400
disrupted by maybe some
business that didn't happen.

45:32.400 --> 45:34.900
Did you read my
notes on the, uh,

45:34.900 --> 45:36.300
on the squirrels?

45:36.300 --> 45:39.200
You know, you really fucked
us on that deal, Mike.

45:39.200 --> 45:40.300
What?

45:40.300 --> 45:42.300
Why didn't you follow my lead?

45:42.300 --> 45:45.300
I mean, just follow my lead, man. I
would have split the money with you.

45:45.300 --> 45:47.500
God, we have real trust issues.

45:47.500 --> 45:48.900
You're eating a real meal.

45:48.900 --> 45:50.300
This is amazing.

45:50.300 --> 45:51.900
Yeah, well, I sleep all day,

45:51.900 --> 45:56.200
and I mostly want to kill myself when I'm
awake, but sure I'm a little hungry.

45:56.200 --> 45:59.100
Well, I'm really
happy about that.

45:59.100 --> 46:02.100
If I had crystal meth in my
hand and a gun in the other,

46:02.100 --> 46:04.300
I would have a hard
time choosing.

46:04.300 --> 46:05.600
But you're hungry?

46:05.600 --> 46:08.200
Yeah, fine, I'm hungry.

46:08.200 --> 46:11.100
Hey, so I figured out where
all the equipment came from.

46:11.100 --> 46:12.400
I'm really hungry.

46:12.400 --> 46:14.800
It turns out it belonged
to a group of researchers.

46:14.800 --> 46:16.200
I found their journal.

46:16.200 --> 46:17.100
Really?

46:17.100 --> 46:19.100
They just left all
that stuff up there?

46:19.100 --> 46:22.800
Man, if I would've found that stuff,
I would've sold it and bought drugs.

46:22.800 --> 46:25.100
Well see, that's the thing I don't get
is like why would they just leave

46:25.100 --> 46:26.100
all that stuff, you know?

46:27.000 --> 46:30.000
It's 'cause they
don't exist, I think,

46:30.000 --> 46:31.300
and you just believe everything

46:31.300 --> 46:33.400
people tell you.

46:39.400 --> 46:41.300
What?

46:41.300 --> 46:42.100
Take a look at it.

46:42.100 --> 46:42.800
I really...

46:42.900 --> 46:44.200
I'm really hungry.

46:44.200 --> 46:46.900
Take a look at the journal
and I'll feed you.

46:46.900 --> 46:47.400
Okay.

46:47.400 --> 46:49.500
See what it says.

46:49.500 --> 46:52.100
Um...

46:52.100 --> 46:54.200
Nikola Tesla.

46:54.200 --> 46:55.500
Fer...

46:55.500 --> 46:57.400
Mike, this is in
a different language.

46:57.400 --> 46:59.900
Do you notice anything else?

46:59.900 --> 47:02.100
It says "telekinesis" a lot.

47:02.100 --> 47:05.300
Look, man, there are a lot
of weird people out here.

47:05.300 --> 47:07.500
Okay, are you sure you don't
know who shot that video?

47:07.500 --> 47:09.700
No, I'm not sure, man.
I was high as fuck.

47:09.900 --> 47:13.300
Okay, take a look at
the clip one more time.

47:13.300 --> 47:15.200
Mike, my blood sugar is low,

47:15.200 --> 47:16.300
and I'm about to pass out.

47:16.300 --> 47:18.000
Will you please give me beans?

47:18.000 --> 47:21.300
You know, you really fucked
us on that deal, Mike.

47:21.300 --> 47:22.300
What?

47:22.300 --> 47:24.400
Why didn't you follow my lead?

47:24.400 --> 47:27.500
What the fuck?

47:27.500 --> 47:30.500
- Am I fucking brain damaged?
- You're eating a real meal.

47:30.500 --> 47:32.500
This is amazing.

47:32.500 --> 47:33.600
Yeah, well I sleep
all day and...

47:33.600 --> 47:35.200
Mike, if my fucking
mind is mush,

47:35.200 --> 47:37.200
don't make me go through this.

47:37.200 --> 47:38.300
Dude, just calm down, okay?

47:39.000 --> 47:40.500
I'm...
Fuck.

47:40.500 --> 47:43.300
I'm seeing the same thing.

47:45.300 --> 47:48.400
It's satellites.

47:48.400 --> 47:49.100
What?

47:49.100 --> 47:49.800
Yeah, man.

47:49.900 --> 47:51.000
I don't know how
they work either

47:51.000 --> 47:53.500
but that's satellites.
That is government satellites

47:53.500 --> 47:55.300
and they have... They
watch everything.

47:56.000 --> 47:58.400
Chris, why would the
government be watching you?

47:58.400 --> 48:00.400
<i>Why would the government
be watching you, Mike?</i>

48:00.400 --> 48:02.500
Look, I don't know
what you've done.

48:02.500 --> 48:04.000
I came here to help you, okay?
That's it, that's all.

48:04.500 --> 48:05.600
Bullshit.

48:05.600 --> 48:07.500
You came here to help
yourself and you know it.

48:07.500 --> 48:08.500
You're absolutely right.

48:08.500 --> 48:10.400
I'm, I'm actually, I am,

48:10.400 --> 48:12.500
I'm a government spy, yeah.

48:12.500 --> 48:14.400
Or no, wait, maybe I'm,

48:14.400 --> 48:16.700
I'm a mass murderer
child molester.

48:16.700 --> 48:19.000
Oh, now you're just being a dick.
I'm trying to tell you, man,

48:19.000 --> 48:20.400
someone's fucking following us.

48:20.400 --> 48:22.000
If someone's following us,

48:22.000 --> 48:24.400
why don't you uncuff me so
we can get away from them?

48:24.400 --> 48:25.500
Will you go into rehab?

48:25.500 --> 48:26.600
Oh, here we go.

48:26.600 --> 48:29.100
I don't know, Mike.

48:29.100 --> 48:31.500
If you don't go in, you'll die.
You know that?

48:31.500 --> 48:32.700
Will you go in?

48:32.700 --> 48:35.400
Look, I don't know
and this is retarded.

48:35.400 --> 48:37.500
Look, if five days got
you from no to maybe

48:37.500 --> 48:41.400
then I'm willing to risk it.

48:41.400 --> 48:43.100
If you're trying
to atone for all

48:43.100 --> 48:47.100
those times we were kids and I saved
you from getting your ass just beaten,

48:47.100 --> 48:49.200
this is a shitty way
of going about it.

48:49.200 --> 48:50.300
You saved me?

48:50.300 --> 48:53.100
You punched like a wind sock.
It's horrifying.

48:53.100 --> 48:55.500
If your wife ever sees
you punch anybody,

48:55.500 --> 48:56.500
you are in deep shit.

48:56.500 --> 48:58.100
She's gonna leave you
for a stronger man.

48:58.100 --> 48:59.500
You know, your lack
of belief in my

48:59.500 --> 49:01.500
good intentions
here is disturbing.

49:01.500 --> 49:04.600
Yeah, well, when your
friend holds you hostage,

49:04.600 --> 49:07.200
you get a different
perspective.

49:07.200 --> 49:09.500
It's like a little story.

49:09.500 --> 49:10.500
Little story.

49:10.500 --> 49:13.400
Little story.

49:13.400 --> 49:14.200
Little story.

49:16.200 --> 49:19.300
Made some coffee,
you want some?

49:19.300 --> 49:21.300
I'm sleeping.

49:21.300 --> 49:23.600
It's good coffee, man,
you should try it.

49:23.600 --> 49:24.800
Does it have crack in it?

49:24.800 --> 49:27.700
Kind of.

49:27.700 --> 49:28.400
Here.

49:31.700 --> 49:35.200
Hey, do you know about any,
uh, any caves nearby?

49:35.200 --> 49:38.100
Yes.

49:38.100 --> 49:39.500
Drive to the end of the road,

49:39.500 --> 49:41.100
and then there's some stables,

49:41.200 --> 49:44.100
and then a dirt trail.

49:44.100 --> 49:48.700
Take that, and then you will find
the, uh, Mexican trafficking cave.

49:48.700 --> 49:50.600
Trafficking cave?

49:50.600 --> 49:51.800
Yeah.

49:51.800 --> 49:53.400
No really, but Billy
and Micah thought

49:53.400 --> 49:56.600
it was this Mexican
drug trafficking cave.

49:56.600 --> 49:58.100
I was like, "Why
would anyone build

49:58.100 --> 49:59.700
a tunnel fifty miles
from Mexico?"

49:59.700 --> 50:02.300
But they're like,
"We're gonna get rich."

50:02.300 --> 50:03.400
Tweakers.

50:03.400 --> 50:05.100
Are you, uh, are you cool
if I go check it out?

50:05.100 --> 50:07.600
I feel like I need a walk.

50:07.600 --> 50:10.500
What about mountain lions?

50:10.500 --> 50:12.100
What about them?

50:12.100 --> 50:14.300
Since 1983, the mountain
lion population

50:14.300 --> 50:15.700
of this town has increased

50:15.700 --> 50:18.100
staggeringly and steadily.

50:18.100 --> 50:21.700
Right now, there's like 13
mountain lions per person.

50:21.700 --> 50:24.700
Yeah, I think, uh,
I think I'll be fine.

50:24.700 --> 50:26.800
You should take my
mountain lion gun.

50:26.800 --> 50:28.600
You have a mountain lion gun?

50:28.600 --> 50:29.800
Mm-hm.

50:29.800 --> 50:31.600
I'm just, I'm gonna
take my chances.

50:31.600 --> 50:34.300
All right, man.

50:34.300 --> 50:34.800
Yeah.

50:35.000 --> 50:37.700
You know, on a side note, I'm
not feeling too bad today.

50:37.700 --> 50:38.700
I feel pretty sweet.

50:38.700 --> 50:39.800
Good.

50:39.800 --> 50:42.800
If you got energy, I will
leave you my laptop here.

50:42.800 --> 50:45.100
There's some, there's some games
on it if you wanna play.

50:45.700 --> 50:46.500
Thank you.

50:46.500 --> 50:47.600
You're welcome.

50:47.600 --> 50:51.200
I will.

50:51.200 --> 50:53.700
Is this a camera?

50:57.700 --> 51:00.800
Hey, girl, hey.

51:05.800 --> 51:07.200
That was a warning, Danube!

51:07.200 --> 51:10.600
I want my tish!

51:33.600 --> 51:35.300
Look, I know this
is a dark moment

51:35.300 --> 51:37.700
but it does get better.

51:37.700 --> 51:42.500
You keep fucking saying that,
man, but you don't get it.

51:42.500 --> 51:46.200
This is the worst of it, okay?

51:46.200 --> 51:49.400
Just make it to tomorrow.

51:49.400 --> 51:53.200
Mike, I never enjoyed life

51:53.200 --> 51:55.300
until I started doing drugs.

51:55.400 --> 51:56.600
Okay, I know that's not true.

51:56.600 --> 52:00.200
It is true.

52:00.200 --> 52:03.300
Our childhood I was miserable.

52:03.300 --> 52:07.800
Our adolescence fucking sucked.

52:07.800 --> 52:10.200
The only time I ever
felt happiness was

52:10.200 --> 52:11.500
when I did a line of speed off

52:11.500 --> 52:14.200
some chick's dresser
at a party.

52:14.200 --> 52:16.600
I saw you happy before that.

52:16.600 --> 52:19.200
Nah, man, I was being polite.

52:19.200 --> 52:21.300
I'm happy on meth.

52:21.300 --> 52:23.300
Look, life gets better, okay?

52:23.300 --> 52:26.200
You, you were just
dealt a shitty hand.

52:26.200 --> 52:28.500
Oh, Jesus, man.

52:28.500 --> 52:32.200
My parents.

52:32.200 --> 52:34.200
I do drugs 'cause
my body chemistry

52:34.200 --> 52:36.900
makes me wanna do drugs.

52:36.900 --> 52:39.600
If I had your parents you
know what I'd be, man?

52:39.600 --> 52:41.500
I'd be a guy with rad
parents who fucking

52:41.500 --> 52:44.700
loves doing drugs.

52:44.700 --> 52:48.400
I mean, God,
I fucking hate people.

52:48.400 --> 52:49.700
Fuck, man, you know
what people do?

52:49.700 --> 52:53.000
They fucking kill dogs.

52:54.000 --> 52:56.500
You, me, and fucking those apes

52:56.500 --> 53:00.600
that killed Sara.

53:00.600 --> 53:02.500
We're all the same.

53:02.500 --> 53:05.800
The only difference is that
I fucking liked Sara.

53:05.800 --> 53:08.300
I loved that dog.

53:08.300 --> 53:11.300
I mean, I just...

53:11.300 --> 53:13.700
I'd rather just do
drugs and end it

53:13.700 --> 53:17.300
on my terms rather
than a virus,

53:17.300 --> 53:21.800
or global warming, or some
shit just killing me slowly.

53:21.800 --> 53:24.500
This is not the same guy that
painted the picture on my wall.

53:24.500 --> 53:26.800
Being creative it's,
it's, it's not...

53:26.800 --> 53:28.900
It's a curse.

53:28.900 --> 53:32.700
It condemns you to a life of failure
'cause you can't sustain interest

53:32.700 --> 53:37.700
in any boring rat race job long
enough to make a living at it.

53:38.000 --> 53:40.500
I'm creative, I make a living.

53:40.500 --> 53:42.400
You make, you're
a graphic designer, man,

53:42.400 --> 53:46.500
you make pamphlets
and DJ fliers.

53:46.500 --> 53:49.000
You're a fucking sellout.

53:49.000 --> 53:52.900
All right, well, you know why none
of this bothers me is because

53:52.900 --> 53:54.800
I can't believe a word
that's come out

53:54.800 --> 53:57.800
of your mouth in
the last three years.

53:57.800 --> 53:59.600
Why don't you let me go then?

53:59.600 --> 54:01.800
Everyone you've
ever known thinks

54:01.800 --> 54:04.500
that you're a liar and a thief.

54:04.500 --> 54:07.600
You know, you tricked us too many times
into thinking you were pulling it together.

54:07.600 --> 54:09.700
Mike, when you
and I were fucking

54:09.700 --> 54:11.800
partying and doing
dumb shit together,

54:11.800 --> 54:14.300
I was doing drugs and you
didn't give a shit then.

54:14.300 --> 54:17.800
Oh, okay, so I guess then I'm,
uh, I'm like your enabler.

54:17.800 --> 54:20.900
Call it whatever
the fuck you want, man.

54:20.900 --> 54:23.000
Some of this shit
is your fault.

54:23.000 --> 54:24.600
We all believe
in the possibility

54:24.600 --> 54:26.700
that you're sick.

54:26.700 --> 54:29.800
We think about all the fucking horrible
things you've done in your life

54:29.800 --> 54:31.900
and which ones we should
hold you accountable for.

54:31.900 --> 54:33.600
You're saying I'm sick?

54:33.600 --> 54:35.500
I never called it
a fucking illness

54:35.500 --> 54:36.600
or any of that shit at all.

54:37.000 --> 54:38.900
So, fuck off.

54:38.900 --> 54:41.500
We all have temptations, okay?

54:41.500 --> 54:43.800
But most of us, we keep
them in check.

54:43.800 --> 54:45.600
We keep them under control
so we don't hurt

54:45.600 --> 54:47.100
the people around us.

54:47.100 --> 54:48.800
You know, man, there
is a, there is a solid

54:48.800 --> 54:51.600
possibility that you're
just fucking selfish.

54:51.600 --> 54:54.000
No fucking shit

54:54.000 --> 54:56.400
I'm fucking selfish, man!

54:56.400 --> 54:57.500
Fuck.

54:57.500 --> 54:58.900
The only reason
you're fucking here,

54:58.900 --> 55:01.500
and I'm chained to
this fucking pipe,

55:01.500 --> 55:03.800
is so that you can have
something to fucking save

55:03.800 --> 55:05.900
and fucking feel
good about yourself.

55:05.900 --> 55:07.800
But guess what, Michael,

55:07.800 --> 55:09.800
you're no fucking
better than anyone else

55:09.800 --> 55:12.500
and your fucking life is
as meaningless as mine

55:12.500 --> 55:16.700
and I swear to fucking God
that I'm gonna fucking sue

55:16.700 --> 55:18.000
the shit out of you when

55:18.000 --> 55:21.900
this fucking shit is done.

55:39.900 --> 55:44.600
I, uh, will be back
later tonight.

55:44.600 --> 55:47.700
I'm really sorry about Sara.

56:51.700 --> 56:53.000
Ah-h-h!

56:53.000 --> 56:56.200
Sorry.

57:02.200 --> 57:06.000
Ow, fuck.

57:06.000 --> 57:06.800
No, I'm just tired,

57:06.800 --> 57:10.900
and I, uh, I sprained my ankle,
you know, on our morning jog.

57:10.900 --> 57:13.000
So...

57:17.000 --> 57:21.600
Actually, the, um, the
neighbor's dog, uh,

57:21.600 --> 57:25.100
just like literally dropped
dead on Chris' porch.

57:25.100 --> 57:26.600
I don't know, it was like, uh,

57:26.600 --> 57:29.900
like a heart attack or
something, and I...

57:29.900 --> 57:31.000
No, it's fine.

57:31.000 --> 57:32.900
Don't, don't be sad, okay?

57:32.900 --> 57:34.700
The dog was ugly as shit.

57:34.700 --> 57:38.100
I just, um, I can't,
I can't decide whether

57:38.100 --> 57:40.100
I should tell
the owner or just bu...

57:40.100 --> 57:42.200
I don't know, I don't
know what to do.

58:11.200 --> 58:13.600
Yes?

58:13.600 --> 58:17.100
Oh, hi.
Um, I'm Michael.

58:17.100 --> 58:20.800
I needed to, uh, talk
to you about your dog.

58:20.800 --> 58:24.100
She's all right, I hope.

58:24.100 --> 58:25.100
Uh, no.

58:25.100 --> 58:26.100
Actually, I'm sorry.

58:26.100 --> 58:30.200
Um, I found her by the road.

58:30.200 --> 58:33.100
It looked like some
coyotes had gotten to her.

58:33.100 --> 58:36.100
Impossible.

58:36.100 --> 58:38.900
Poor Sophie.

58:41.900 --> 58:44.300
Would you like to
sit for a moment?

58:44.300 --> 58:46.700
I just made some tea.

58:46.700 --> 58:51.300
I think it's just a sprain.

58:51.300 --> 58:53.800
But, yeah, I mean, um,

58:53.800 --> 58:55.100
yeah, I could go for some tea.

58:55.100 --> 58:57.300
Thank you.

59:24.300 --> 59:27.200
I, uh, I never
caught your name.

59:27.200 --> 59:29.300
Byron.

59:29.300 --> 59:31.100
I'm Michael.

59:37.100 --> 59:38.000
You are from the city?

59:38.800 --> 59:40.700
Yeah, yeah, I'm just out here

59:40.700 --> 59:44.200
taking care of my friend.

59:44.200 --> 59:46.200
Thank you.

01:00:06.200 --> 01:00:07.700
Do you mind?

01:00:07.700 --> 01:00:10.600
Oh, no, go right ahead.

01:00:13.600 --> 01:00:15.000
Are you French?

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:18.000
Yeah.

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:20.200
How long have you
been out here?

01:00:20.200 --> 01:00:22.000
Almost thirty years,

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:25.800
believe it or not.

01:00:25.800 --> 01:00:28.100
I mean, how'd you, uh,
how did you end up here?

01:00:28.100 --> 01:00:31.200
If you don't mind me asking.

01:00:31.200 --> 01:00:35.800
I was studying archeology
at the Sorbonne, and, uh,

01:00:35.800 --> 01:00:39.900
I receive a grant
to study native art.

01:00:39.900 --> 01:00:44.100
And you just never went back?

01:00:44.100 --> 01:00:45.100
I study man,

01:00:45.100 --> 01:00:49.400
but I prefer not
to be with him.

01:00:53.400 --> 01:00:55.200
You are fine.

01:00:55.200 --> 01:00:58.200
I can run faster than
you at the moment.

01:01:07.200 --> 01:01:09.300
So, you, uh,

01:01:09.300 --> 01:01:11.400
you have a lot of time
to yourself here.

01:01:11.400 --> 01:01:15.300
It is a unusual story.

01:01:18.300 --> 01:01:22.300
I've, uh, I've got some time.

01:01:28.300 --> 01:01:31.000
Two students came here with me.

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:34.300
They said they were studying
some related topics

01:01:34.300 --> 01:01:38.200
in archeology and physics.

01:01:38.200 --> 01:01:42.000
Something about new
carbon dating methods.

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:47.900
They were very excited
when they first arrived

01:01:47.900 --> 01:01:50.300
but then the arguing began.

01:01:50.300 --> 01:01:53.100
One would accuse the other
of hiding research

01:01:53.100 --> 01:01:56.200
or stealing findings.

01:01:56.200 --> 01:01:59.400
A lot of screaming
and slammed doors.

01:02:01.400 --> 01:02:03.300
Oh, no, I'm good.

01:02:03.300 --> 01:02:06.400
Actually, I haven't done
that since college.

01:02:06.400 --> 01:02:07.800
Actually, what, what is that?

01:02:07.800 --> 01:02:09.000
I've never seen
it red like that.

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:11.900
I cannot remember
the exact name,

01:02:11.900 --> 01:02:16.000
but the seeds I brought
from South America

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:19.200
many years ago.

01:02:19.200 --> 01:02:20.400
It grows nicely on the hillside

01:02:20.400 --> 01:02:23.200
this time of year.

01:02:27.200 --> 01:02:28.200
What?

01:02:28.200 --> 01:02:31.200
What was I saying?

01:02:31.200 --> 01:02:33.500
You were telling me
about the students.

01:02:33.500 --> 01:02:35.900
Yes.

01:02:35.900 --> 01:02:40.000
I do not know what they
were actually studying

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:43.400
but the yelling was constant,

01:02:43.400 --> 01:02:48.300
and one day the noise
went into the woods

01:02:48.300 --> 01:02:50.400
and they never returned.

01:02:50.400 --> 01:02:52.700
- Did they go back to France?
- They left their passports.

01:02:52.900 --> 01:02:56.400
I tried to find them
through university

01:02:56.400 --> 01:02:58.400
but there was no
record of them.

01:02:58.400 --> 01:03:01.500
And you don't know what
they were researching?

01:03:01.500 --> 01:03:03.500
I found some papers
in the trash,

01:03:03.500 --> 01:03:07.300
some esoteric writings
on manipulating

01:03:07.300 --> 01:03:11.400
light and sound waves.

01:03:11.400 --> 01:03:15.100
I think they were
searching for monsters

01:03:15.100 --> 01:03:17.900
and they found each other.

01:03:20.900 --> 01:03:24.000
Monsters?

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:26.100
The people come here, Michael,

01:03:26.100 --> 01:03:29.200
to look for aliens,

01:03:29.200 --> 01:03:33.500
ghosts, and cults,
and gateways to hell,

01:03:33.500 --> 01:03:36.400
and secret military bases

01:03:36.500 --> 01:03:41.100
looking into other dimensions.

01:03:41.100 --> 01:03:44.400
I think if there is something

01:03:44.400 --> 01:03:47.900
it is not none of these things,

01:03:47.900 --> 01:03:50.500
or perhaps all of them.

01:03:50.500 --> 01:03:52.600
I'm sorry, I'm not at
all following

01:03:52.600 --> 01:03:54.600
what you're saying.

01:03:54.600 --> 01:03:57.000
How does an isolated
tribesman in Ecuador

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:01.200
know the difference
between an alien,

01:04:01.200 --> 01:04:05.400
an angel, and a ghost?

01:04:06.400 --> 01:04:09.300
I have no idea.

01:04:09.300 --> 01:04:10.500
He doesn't,

01:04:10.500 --> 01:04:15.200
but he tells a story

01:04:15.200 --> 01:04:19.300
to make sense

01:04:19.300 --> 01:04:23.400
of the infinite.

01:04:23.400 --> 01:04:26.400
Sometimes when

01:04:26.400 --> 01:04:28.400
I stare up

01:04:28.400 --> 01:04:32.400
and look into the infinite

01:04:32.400 --> 01:04:35.300
I see film.

01:04:38.300 --> 01:04:39.300
A film?

01:04:39.300 --> 01:04:44.400
A membrane there,
and behind it is another,

01:04:44.400 --> 01:04:47.500
and another,

01:04:47.500 --> 01:04:50.000
and another.

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:55.600
Do you see?

01:04:55.600 --> 01:04:59.400
No, I, uh... No, I don't.

01:04:59.400 --> 01:05:01.600
I'm sorry.

01:05:01.600 --> 01:05:05.300
Each one has a beginning,

01:05:05.300 --> 01:05:07.500
middle,

01:05:07.500 --> 01:05:10.600
and end.

01:05:10.600 --> 01:05:12.000
Beginning,

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:14.500
middle,

01:05:14.500 --> 01:05:17.700
end.

01:05:17.700 --> 01:05:22.100
Beginning,

01:05:22.100 --> 01:05:24.400
middle...

01:05:28.400 --> 01:05:30.400
...end.

01:05:30.400 --> 01:05:32.400
Thank you so much for the tea

01:05:32.400 --> 01:05:33.600
and the aspirin.

01:05:33.600 --> 01:05:35.600
I, uh, I should make my way

01:05:35.600 --> 01:05:39.100
back home now.

01:05:39.100 --> 01:05:41.600
Again, I'm sorry
about your dog.

01:05:41.600 --> 01:05:44.600
Aspirin?

01:06:06.600 --> 01:06:08.300
Shit.

01:06:08.300 --> 01:06:09.400
Shit!

01:06:09.400 --> 01:06:10.700
Fuck, Chris!

01:06:10.700 --> 01:06:12.000
What?

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:13.300
What's happening? What?

01:06:13.400 --> 01:06:15.400
Fuck.

01:06:15.400 --> 01:06:16.500
God.

01:06:16.500 --> 01:06:19.400
What's wrong with you?
Jesus, are you all right?

01:06:19.400 --> 01:06:20.400
Fucking "A".

01:06:20.400 --> 01:06:23.000
Oh, no, dude, I'm fine, man.

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:24.500
This is nothin'.

01:06:24.500 --> 01:06:27.200
Oh, no big deal.

01:06:27.200 --> 01:06:29.000
No, I was, uh...

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:31.200
I couldn't find an artery
with a coffee cup,

01:06:31.200 --> 01:06:33.200
so I was trying
to pull a spring out

01:06:33.200 --> 01:06:36.600
of the mattress here,
but this mattress

01:06:36.600 --> 01:06:39.100
is like made by NASA
or something, man.

01:06:39.100 --> 01:06:40.500
It's like Teflon.

01:06:40.500 --> 01:06:41.500
Goddammit.

01:06:41.500 --> 01:06:43.400
Could not get a spring out.

01:06:43.400 --> 01:06:44.300
God, it's just...

01:06:44.300 --> 01:06:46.000
Just fell asleep,
I guess, after that.

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:49.000
It's tiresome.

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:50.600
Fucking "A", man.

01:06:50.600 --> 01:06:51.500
What's up with you?

01:06:51.500 --> 01:06:52.600
You scared me.

01:06:52.600 --> 01:06:55.200
Why'd you run
in here like that?

01:06:55.200 --> 01:06:56.000
Seriously.

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:57.200
I scared you?

01:06:57.300 --> 01:06:58.600
Yeah, you came in
guns blazing, man.

01:06:58.600 --> 01:07:01.200
- I thought there was a fucking...
- It's a fucking scratch.

01:07:01.200 --> 01:07:03.600
...war
outside.

01:07:03.600 --> 01:07:04.500
Yeah, dude, it's no big deal.

01:07:04.500 --> 01:07:06.700
Goddammit.

01:07:06.700 --> 01:07:09.800
Woo.

01:07:12.800 --> 01:07:15.700
See, man, no problem.

01:07:15.700 --> 01:07:18.400
Thank you, nurse.

01:07:18.400 --> 01:07:19.200
You're welcome.

01:07:19.200 --> 01:07:22.500
There we go.

01:07:26.500 --> 01:07:27.700
What's up with your limp?

01:07:27.700 --> 01:07:31.600
Yeah, I, uh, I fell running.

01:07:31.600 --> 01:07:34.600
Fuck, dude, I told ya, man,
mountain lions out there.

01:07:34.600 --> 01:07:36.700
Homeless guy.

01:07:36.700 --> 01:07:40.800
Homeless guy?

01:07:40.800 --> 01:07:43.900
Mike, you know what?

01:07:43.900 --> 01:07:46.600
There's a lot of hobo
junkies in that cave

01:07:46.600 --> 01:07:48.700
I sent you to.

01:07:48.700 --> 01:07:51.100
Don't go to that cave, dude.

01:07:59.100 --> 01:08:04.200
Hey, I'm sorry, man.

01:08:04.200 --> 01:08:06.900
There really are a lot
of weird people out here.

01:08:49.899 --> 01:08:53.700
Chris.

01:08:53.700 --> 01:08:54.800
Yeah?

01:08:54.800 --> 01:08:58.300
Is this your knife?

01:08:58.300 --> 01:09:00.399
Hey, man, yeah it is.

01:09:00.399 --> 01:09:02.800
I lost it a couple weeks ago.

01:09:02.800 --> 01:09:04.500
Man, I could've
used it this week.

01:09:04.500 --> 01:09:05.800
Where'd you find it?

01:09:05.800 --> 01:09:07.700
Below this fucking
carving that appeared

01:09:07.700 --> 01:09:10.500
while we were asleep.

01:09:10.600 --> 01:09:11.899
Looks exactly like the story

01:09:11.899 --> 01:09:14.300
on the cave wall yesterday.

01:09:17.300 --> 01:09:20.700
Mike, are you
feeling all right?

01:09:20.700 --> 01:09:24.399
Yeah.

01:09:24.399 --> 01:09:26.899
Mike, are you sure?

01:09:26.899 --> 01:09:29.399
Yeah, what's that got
to do with the carving?

01:09:29.399 --> 01:09:31.700
I don't know, 'cause when you're out
here, your mind plays tricks on you.

01:09:31.700 --> 01:09:33.899
You know, the elevation,
the electrical

01:09:33.899 --> 01:09:35.500
does weird things,
and there's satellites

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:37.000
that are always watching.

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:38.700
Will you stop talking
about the satellites?

01:09:38.700 --> 01:09:40.700
I don't know how they work either,
Mike, but there are satellites,

01:09:40.800 --> 01:09:41.800
and they're always here
always watching.

01:09:41.800 --> 01:09:47.300
Look, you are a suicidal
paranoid junkie, okay?

01:09:47.300 --> 01:09:48.800
You're my friend,

01:09:48.800 --> 01:09:50.500
but you're a crazy drug addict.

01:09:50.500 --> 01:09:52.800
Fine, I'm just saying
there's satellites.

01:09:52.800 --> 01:09:54.900
Listen, okay?

01:09:54.900 --> 01:09:55.700
You never listen.

01:09:55.700 --> 01:09:58.300
Will you just listen to me?

01:10:01.300 --> 01:10:03.500
Look, I stopped by Sara's

01:10:03.500 --> 01:10:07.600
owner's place yesterday, okay?

01:10:07.600 --> 01:10:09.400
He knew the people who
owned the equipment

01:10:09.400 --> 01:10:12.900
down in the shed.

01:10:12.900 --> 01:10:14.700
They have been missing
for thirty years.

01:10:14.700 --> 01:10:17.900
Mike, you know I know
you're a good guy,

01:10:17.900 --> 01:10:21.300
but I gotta tell ya
I've never seen

01:10:21.300 --> 01:10:23.600
any of the stuff
you're talking about.

01:10:23.600 --> 01:10:25.300
I get that, okay?

01:10:25.300 --> 01:10:26.700
Will you just, will
you just hear me out

01:10:26.700 --> 01:10:29.600
so I can just try and
make sense of this?

01:10:29.600 --> 01:10:31.400
All right.

01:10:31.400 --> 01:10:34.900
All right, so people
come to the boonies

01:10:34.900 --> 01:10:39.000
to like explore religion,

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:42.000
or to, uh, hallucinate,

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:44.400
or to tell ghost stories,

01:10:44.400 --> 01:10:46.700
or, you know, find UFOs,

01:10:46.700 --> 01:10:48.800
or Bigfoot, or whatever,

01:10:48.800 --> 01:10:50.600
and we've been led
to some stories.

01:10:50.600 --> 01:10:51.700
We've allegedly been led...

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:53.000
Listen, dude!

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:57.900
Look, assume that I am honest

01:10:57.900 --> 01:11:00.300
and sane, okay?

01:11:00.300 --> 01:11:04.800
We were presented with
several stories, all right?

01:11:04.800 --> 01:11:08.300
And all of those stories

01:11:08.300 --> 01:11:11.700
had an ending.

01:11:13.700 --> 01:11:15.400
What the fuck was that?

01:11:15.400 --> 01:11:16.400
Mike, it's an old house.

01:11:16.400 --> 01:11:17.600
It's gonna make
noise sometimes.

01:11:17.600 --> 01:11:20.800
It's not a big deal.

01:11:20.800 --> 01:11:24.700
Look, I'll never really know what
actually happened this last week,

01:11:24.700 --> 01:11:28.600
but if I could like

01:11:28.600 --> 01:11:33.400
give you closure, or whatever,

01:11:33.400 --> 01:11:37.100
maybe it'll make
you feel better.

01:11:37.100 --> 01:11:38.800
I mean, we're paid
through until sundown,

01:11:38.800 --> 01:11:41.600
but, um, yeah,

01:11:41.600 --> 01:11:45.600
I mean at this point I
guess it is what it is.

01:11:47.600 --> 01:11:49.900
Will you sit down?

01:12:07.900 --> 01:12:11.400
I will never go to rehab.

01:12:14.400 --> 01:12:17.600
Ever.

01:12:17.600 --> 01:12:20.400
Please just let me kill myself

01:12:20.400 --> 01:12:24.800
the way that I want
to kill myself.

01:12:24.800 --> 01:12:31.400
I appreciate all the stuff you're
doing for me, man, but as my friend,

01:12:31.800 --> 01:12:34.900
you gotta just let me go.

01:12:37.900 --> 01:12:40.700
All right.

01:12:44.700 --> 01:12:46.000
All right.

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:53.100
Did you Photoshop that?

01:12:53.100 --> 01:12:54.700
Why the fuck would you do that?

01:12:54.700 --> 01:12:56.500
No, I didn't.

01:12:56.500 --> 01:12:59.800
Just give me
the fucking key, please.

01:13:03.800 --> 01:13:06.700
Fuck this, I'm going home.

01:13:10.700 --> 01:13:11.900
You gotta be fucking
kidding me, Mike.

01:13:11.900 --> 01:13:13.000
Really?

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:17.000
Chris, the slide machine just
turned on and operated by itself.

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:18.600
It's electrical, Mike.

01:13:18.600 --> 01:13:21.600
I guarantee you the wiring in this
house is not up to code, man.

01:13:21.600 --> 01:13:25.800
There's pictures of us in the
fucking thing that we didn't take.

01:13:25.800 --> 01:13:28.900
I don't know what the fuck
you do when you leave here.

01:13:28.900 --> 01:13:30.500
Look, ever since I opened up

01:13:30.500 --> 01:13:31.900
that clip of you
something's been...

01:13:31.900 --> 01:13:33.900
Oh, now you're gonna tell
you didn't open that?

01:13:33.900 --> 01:13:37.000
What would convince you that
I'm not lying or crazy?

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:38.200
I don't know.

01:13:38.200 --> 01:13:41.200
So, we're at an impasse?

01:13:41.200 --> 01:13:43.900
I guess so.

01:13:46.900 --> 01:13:47.900
Did you see that?

01:13:47.900 --> 01:13:48.700
Did you see that?

01:13:48.700 --> 01:13:50.200
See what? See what?

01:13:50.200 --> 01:13:52.200
That. That.

01:14:00.200 --> 01:14:03.000
Fuck, no, no!

01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:20.500
We need to leave before
they get here.

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:23.900
- Mike, I don't understand.
- Look, man, I'm sorry.

01:14:23.900 --> 01:14:25.100
I don't...

01:14:25.100 --> 01:14:27.500
Could we go, please?

01:14:27.500 --> 01:14:30.500
Wait, hold on. Let's just, uh,

01:14:30.500 --> 01:14:32.700
let's just think
about this, okay?

01:14:32.700 --> 01:14:36.100
We, uh, we know it doesn't

01:14:36.100 --> 01:14:39.200
want me to go home,

01:14:39.200 --> 01:14:42.600
but we know we can't stay here.

01:14:46.600 --> 01:14:50.800
Mike, we gotta... Please, let's go.
What's going on, Mike?

01:14:50.800 --> 01:14:52.500
Just calm down, okay?
We'll be all right.

01:14:52.500 --> 01:14:54.900
Mike, no.

01:14:54.900 --> 01:14:56.600
- Mike, what's happening?
- I don't know.

01:14:56.600 --> 01:14:58.800
Mike, if you had
to guess what...

01:15:02.800 --> 01:15:06.300
Okay, say, uh...

01:15:06.300 --> 01:15:10.000
Say, uh, say we hit
some film, okay,

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:14.300
and I'm, I'm looking
at you, all right?

01:15:14.300 --> 01:15:16.700
We take that film,
we get it developed,

01:15:16.700 --> 01:15:19.100
and then when I'm
looking at you,

01:15:19.100 --> 01:15:21.100
appears on the photo.

01:15:21.100 --> 01:15:23.900
It's basically it's like,
like using your mind

01:15:23.900 --> 01:15:26.700
to send whatever you're seeing,

01:15:26.700 --> 01:15:29.900
or thinking, or imagining,
to a, to a film,

01:15:29.900 --> 01:15:33.100
or a tape, or something.

01:15:35.100 --> 01:15:38.700
We were both in that.

01:15:38.700 --> 01:15:40.700
I know.

01:15:49.700 --> 01:15:54.200
What does it want, Mike?

01:15:54.200 --> 01:15:55.200
I don't know.

01:15:55.200 --> 01:15:58.300
Afucking, a theory, man?

01:16:00.300 --> 01:16:04.700
I think it wants a story.

01:16:04.700 --> 01:16:06.100
That's it?

01:16:06.100 --> 01:16:09.000
That's all?

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:12.600
I think it wants
a story with an ending.

01:16:15.600 --> 01:16:17.400
Mike, wait, wait, wait.

01:16:17.400 --> 01:16:19.400
Where're we going?

01:16:19.400 --> 01:16:23.200
Okay, on the webcam it was daylight
when they were in the cabin, right?

01:16:23.200 --> 01:16:24.200
Uh-huh.

01:16:24.200 --> 01:16:26.900
Okay, so we'll take my truck,
we'll drive somewhere nearby,

01:16:26.900 --> 01:16:28.000
and we'll come back later
tonight after they're gone.

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:28.700
Then what?

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:32.100
Uh, we'll shake hands,
and I'll go home.

01:16:32.100 --> 01:16:33.300
I mean, that's what you wanted

01:16:33.300 --> 01:16:36.800
and it gives us an ending.

01:16:36.800 --> 01:16:37.800
I found it.

01:16:37.800 --> 01:16:39.700
- Found what?
- What I owe Billy.

01:16:39.700 --> 01:16:41.200
- Hey, how the fuck did you get...
- I don't know, man!

01:16:41.200 --> 01:16:43.200
I was fucking high, and I tried to
drive this stupid fucking truck.

01:16:43.200 --> 01:16:44.200
Just get it the fuck
out of here.

01:16:44.200 --> 01:16:46.000
Okay, I will.
Calm down, all right, dude?

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:46.700
Jesus.

01:16:46.900 --> 01:16:48.900
Please put it in
the cabin or something.

01:16:48.900 --> 01:16:50.400
Shit.

01:16:50.400 --> 01:16:52.100
Just give it...

01:16:52.100 --> 01:16:53.800
I'm going in the house.

01:16:53.800 --> 01:16:55.100
Here give me... Up
the fucking hill.

01:16:55.100 --> 01:16:57.100
Fuck me.

01:17:02.100 --> 01:17:03.900
Fuck.

01:17:03.900 --> 01:17:07.200
Fuck.

01:17:07.200 --> 01:17:09.900
Oh.

01:17:14.900 --> 01:17:17.200
Don't, don't play that.

01:17:27.200 --> 01:17:29.800
Who is that?

01:17:29.800 --> 01:17:34.400
It's Charles' friends.
I'll go talk to 'em.

01:17:34.400 --> 01:17:36.400
Hey, I'm sorry we're
a little late,

01:17:36.400 --> 01:17:37.700
but we were just leaving.

01:17:37.700 --> 01:17:39.100
Wait!

01:17:43.100 --> 01:17:44.300
No, please.

01:17:44.300 --> 01:17:45.400
Please.

01:17:45.400 --> 01:17:49.500
Please! No, wait!

01:17:50.100 --> 01:17:52.200
I'm a fath...

01:17:56.200 --> 01:17:58.000
Burn it.

01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:05.000
It's a horrible idea.

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:07.100
It's a horrible idea.

01:18:07.100 --> 01:18:09.800
It's a horrible idea.

01:18:12.800 --> 01:18:16.000
All right.

01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:17.400
We know I can't go home,

01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:20.200
but we can't go to
the cabin any time

01:18:20.200 --> 01:18:22.500
today or tonight.

01:18:22.500 --> 01:18:24.000
Fuck, man.

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:25.700
Can you just fucking
call someone?

01:18:25.700 --> 01:18:28.300
Call the fucking,
call the fucking FBI.

01:18:28.300 --> 01:18:29.900
Call the fucking FBI
or something

01:18:29.900 --> 01:18:34.300
and let's fucking go!

01:18:34.300 --> 01:18:37.300
I can't take this home.

01:18:37.300 --> 01:18:39.100
No, we gotta get through
this thing here, okay?

01:18:39.100 --> 01:18:41.500
We, uh, we don't even know

01:18:41.500 --> 01:18:44.200
if it can do anything to us.

01:18:49.200 --> 01:18:51.000
I'll go. I'll go first.

01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:53.900
No, we'll both go.

01:18:53.900 --> 01:18:54.900
Fuck, man.

01:18:54.900 --> 01:18:56.100
Do you think there's bats?

01:18:56.100 --> 01:18:58.100
Probably.

01:18:58.100 --> 01:19:00.100
Do you remember Danny Kaiser?

01:19:00.100 --> 01:19:01.200
With the messed up teeth?

01:19:01.200 --> 01:19:03.300
Yeah.

01:19:03.300 --> 01:19:05.300
He was squatting at
a barn up the street.

01:19:05.300 --> 01:19:07.900
Like a couple months
ago he got rabies.

01:19:07.900 --> 01:19:08.600
Did he die?

01:19:08.600 --> 01:19:11.000
He wishes he was
dead because he

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:12.400
was just foaming at the
mouth when they got him.

01:19:12.400 --> 01:19:15.300
He was just walking in
circles, and was chasing kids.

01:19:15.300 --> 01:19:19.400
He can only say a few words now,
and he just drools all the time.

01:19:19.400 --> 01:19:22.100
Look, Mike, I know your leg's hurt, but
if there's something down there, man,

01:19:22.100 --> 01:19:23.900
you gotta just,
please, just run

01:19:23.900 --> 01:19:25.100
like it doesn't hurt, okay?

01:19:25.100 --> 01:19:26.200
Please?

01:19:26.200 --> 01:19:27.900
Okay.

01:19:27.900 --> 01:19:29.300
Do you remember Derrick Jones?

01:19:29.300 --> 01:19:31.000
Oh, fuck. All right, I'll go.

01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:32.100
Jesus.

01:19:32.100 --> 01:19:33.300
Thanks, man.

01:19:56.300 --> 01:19:58.600
What if we just didn't open it?

01:19:58.600 --> 01:20:00.200
We have to open it.

01:20:00.200 --> 01:20:03.000
What if we just took it with us,
and then if we wanted to open it,

01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:05.000
we would consider opening,
opening it then?

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:07.400
Look, I can't go home and
that last footage saved you

01:20:07.400 --> 01:20:09.900
from getting beaten
to death or shot.

01:20:09.900 --> 01:20:12.300
We don't know that, right?

01:20:12.300 --> 01:20:14.300
What if this thing's actually
trying to help us?

01:20:14.300 --> 01:20:17.400
We don't even know if this stuff
is really gonna happen or not.

01:20:26.400 --> 01:20:28.500
That car was a gift.

01:20:28.500 --> 01:20:29.600
Goddammit.

01:20:29.600 --> 01:20:32.100
All right, man, open it.

01:20:37.100 --> 01:20:39.900
Ow, fuck.

01:20:39.900 --> 01:20:41.900
It's us.

01:20:41.900 --> 01:20:43.200
And?

01:20:43.200 --> 01:20:46.500
Uh, we're outside
and the cabin's

01:20:46.500 --> 01:20:50.500
in the background.

01:20:50.500 --> 01:20:52.400
Okay, what else?

01:20:52.400 --> 01:20:54.600
Okay, we're still
outside but it's night,

01:20:54.600 --> 01:20:56.500
and we're lit by a fire.

01:20:56.500 --> 01:20:57.600
A fire?

01:20:57.600 --> 01:20:59.200
Yeah.

01:20:59.200 --> 01:21:00.300
Do we look all right?

01:21:00.300 --> 01:21:02.400
I, I don't know, I mean,

01:21:02.400 --> 01:21:04.100
yeah, I think,
I think we look okay.

01:21:04.100 --> 01:21:05.300
And are we upset?

01:21:05.300 --> 01:21:06.500
I don't know.

01:21:06.500 --> 01:21:08.400
It's difficult to see.

01:21:08.400 --> 01:21:11.400
I don't know.

01:21:11.400 --> 01:21:14.100
Do you think all that stuff
down there is of us?

01:21:14.100 --> 01:21:15.600
Why are you asking me?
Fuck, really?

01:21:15.600 --> 01:21:17.300
You don't wanna talk about it?
Okay.

01:21:17.300 --> 01:21:19.500
Yes, I think it's all us.

01:21:19.500 --> 01:21:21.500
Do you think that's all of it?

01:21:21.500 --> 01:21:23.100
No.

01:21:23.100 --> 01:21:25.000
I think we could be on any

01:21:25.100 --> 01:21:26.400
recording device anywhere.

01:21:26.400 --> 01:21:30.500
We could be on a fucking
hard drive in China.

01:21:30.500 --> 01:21:32.600
They should be at
the cabin by now.

01:21:32.600 --> 01:21:36.100
Do you think they
found the bag?

01:21:36.100 --> 01:21:38.200
I left it inside
for them to find.

01:21:38.200 --> 01:21:38.700
Fuck.

01:21:38.900 --> 01:21:40.900
They're smoking that bag, man.
They're fucking smoking that bag.

01:21:40.900 --> 01:21:42.100
Maybe they took the
trees to the road.

01:21:42.100 --> 01:21:45.300
No, man, they're getting fucked up,
and they're fucking waiting for us

01:21:45.300 --> 01:21:48.500
to fuck us up.

01:21:48.500 --> 01:21:52.100
I'm gonna go to that
place in the film.

01:21:52.100 --> 01:21:53.400
The rocks in front
of the cabin.

01:21:53.400 --> 01:21:55.500
Why would... That's
fucking nighttime, man.

01:21:55.500 --> 01:21:57.100
It's like fucking noon right now.
Are you crazy?

01:21:57.200 --> 01:21:58.500
I'll be fine, okay?

01:21:58.500 --> 01:22:00.700
Look, I'm gonna sneak
around the back,

01:22:00.700 --> 01:22:02.400
I'll be far enough away,
and plus they're probably

01:22:02.400 --> 01:22:03.700
so fucked up they won't
even know I'm there.

01:22:03.700 --> 01:22:05.700
Why would you fucking do that?

01:22:05.700 --> 01:22:08.600
Because I think if we
can get to the end

01:22:08.600 --> 01:22:12.100
of this reel of film,
we'll be fine.

01:22:12.100 --> 01:22:13.700
You don't fucking know that.

01:22:13.700 --> 01:22:15.600
No, I don't, but do you
have a better plan?

01:22:15.600 --> 01:22:17.100
Yeah, man, let's fucking leave.

01:22:17.100 --> 01:22:18.700
Chris, I am not taking this

01:22:18.700 --> 01:22:22.500
home to my wife.

01:22:22.500 --> 01:22:26.100
Fuck!

01:22:26.100 --> 01:22:27.600
All right, man,
fuck it I'll go.

01:22:27.600 --> 01:22:28.300
Let's go.

01:22:28.300 --> 01:22:30.400
You can leave. No, fuck you,
don't make me feel guilty.

01:22:30.400 --> 01:22:33.300
I'll fucking go, I said
I'll go, let's go.

01:22:33.300 --> 01:22:37.500
All right.

01:22:37.500 --> 01:22:39.000
Lighter, lighter,
lighter, pants on fire.

01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:41.200
Do it, do it, do it, do it.

01:22:47.200 --> 01:22:50.200
So, what's it like, uh,

01:22:50.200 --> 01:22:53.000
what's it like being married?

01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:56.000
It's good, you know,
I mean it's, uh,

01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:58.600
it's hard, but, uh,

01:22:58.600 --> 01:23:01.600
yeah, I like it.

01:23:02.600 --> 01:23:06.700
What's it like being single?

01:23:06.700 --> 01:23:09.600
Well, getting high all
the time pretty much

01:23:09.600 --> 01:23:12.600
covers that base.

01:23:12.600 --> 01:23:14.400
You don't have like
a, like a junkie

01:23:14.400 --> 01:23:16.400
girlfriend or something?

01:23:16.400 --> 01:23:18.200
No.

01:23:18.200 --> 01:23:21.300
No, I don't.

01:23:21.300 --> 01:23:26.200
Actually, I did go into the
city like a couple months ago,

01:23:26.200 --> 01:23:30.500
and I picked
up a little "hmm-hmm."

01:23:30.500 --> 01:23:33.200
What's that? What's "hmm-hmm"?

01:23:33.200 --> 01:23:34.600
Yeah, what's that?

01:23:34.600 --> 01:23:37.100
You know, man, like
on the back of the...

01:23:37.200 --> 01:23:41.600
Like the reader those,
those like little box ads.

01:23:41.600 --> 01:23:43.100
I don't know.

01:23:43.100 --> 01:23:44.500
A fucking hooker, Mike.

01:23:44.500 --> 01:23:46.100
Goddamn.

01:23:46.100 --> 01:23:49.600
Yeah, the whole thing just
was like ridiculous, man.

01:23:49.600 --> 01:23:53.100
Um, we just, basically
just were gacking rails

01:23:53.100 --> 01:23:56.400
all night long, and, uh,

01:23:56.400 --> 01:23:59.700
I just talked her ear
off for like six hours,

01:23:59.700 --> 01:24:02.200
and then by the end of it, um,

01:24:02.200 --> 01:24:05.700
she just like took off
like all freaked out.

01:24:05.700 --> 01:24:07.200
We never even took our
clothes off or nothing.

01:24:07.200 --> 01:24:09.600
We just talked,
and then I scared her.

01:24:09.600 --> 01:24:11.600
That was pretty much my
last sexual experience.

01:24:11.600 --> 01:24:12.900
That sounds awful.

01:24:12.900 --> 01:24:15.600
It was horrible.

01:24:15.600 --> 01:24:18.200
Yeah.

01:24:18.200 --> 01:24:21.600
Was it true about
the, uh, dad thing?

01:24:21.600 --> 01:24:23.100
What dad thing?

01:24:23.100 --> 01:24:25.500
On the fucking CD.

01:24:25.500 --> 01:24:27.700
Yeah.

01:24:27.700 --> 01:24:30.500
Yeah, I'm gonna be a dad.

01:24:30.500 --> 01:24:31.500
Fuck, man.

01:24:31.500 --> 01:24:33.300
Are you sketched out?

01:24:33.300 --> 01:24:34.400
I'm okay with it.

01:24:34.400 --> 01:24:36.500
When's it going down?

01:24:36.500 --> 01:24:37.400
Seven months.

01:24:37.400 --> 01:24:39.700
Seven months?

01:24:39.700 --> 01:24:41.200
Boy or girl?

01:24:41.200 --> 01:24:43.200
Well, it's a little
early to tell.

01:24:43.200 --> 01:24:45.300
Well, I'm not
a pediatrician, Mike.

01:24:45.300 --> 01:24:47.400
I don't know.
Obstetrician.

01:24:47.400 --> 01:24:49.100
Whatever, man.

01:24:49.100 --> 01:24:52.600
Um, yeah, let's just
hope it's a boy, right?

01:24:52.600 --> 01:24:57.500
Better worrying about one wiener
than like every wiener in the world.

01:24:57.500 --> 01:24:58.800
Could I borrow
one of your guns?

01:24:58.800 --> 01:25:02.300
Sure, dude.

01:25:02.300 --> 01:25:03.900
You would make a good uncle.

01:25:03.900 --> 01:25:06.200
Whatever.

01:25:06.200 --> 01:25:07.300
That's bull, that's
bullshit, man.

01:25:07.300 --> 01:25:09.400
Give yourself
a little credit, man.

01:25:09.400 --> 01:25:10.700
Seriously, you're like,

01:25:10.700 --> 01:25:12.300
you're one of the most loyal,

01:25:12.300 --> 01:25:15.300
protective, and smartest
people I know.

01:25:15.300 --> 01:25:18.100
You know, and you don't
wave it in people's faces

01:25:18.200 --> 01:25:19.800
and make them feel
stupid about it.

01:25:19.800 --> 01:25:22.400
Come on, that's
a bunch of malarkey,

01:25:22.400 --> 01:25:23.600
but thanks, though.

01:25:23.600 --> 01:25:25.300
I'm serious.

01:25:25.300 --> 01:25:26.900
Okay, why do you think,

01:25:26.900 --> 01:25:29.400
why do you think you've
lasted as long as you have

01:25:29.400 --> 01:25:31.500
like you have?

01:25:31.500 --> 01:25:35.600
It's because the dirt bags you hang out
with actually like being around you.

01:25:35.600 --> 01:25:38.600
You know, I think it
makes them feel better

01:25:38.600 --> 01:25:40.800
about their dark souls
to have someone

01:25:40.800 --> 01:25:42.700
like you around.

01:25:42.700 --> 01:25:44.700
I appreciate it, man,
but I'm a piece of shit.

01:25:44.700 --> 01:25:46.400
You know it.

01:25:46.400 --> 01:25:47.900
You know.
No, you're not.

01:25:47.900 --> 01:25:51.800
Well, well, I mean even
though you completely

01:25:51.800 --> 01:25:55.300
abandoned your pregnant wife
to save a piece of shit

01:25:55.300 --> 01:25:58.300
like myself, I, uh,

01:25:58.300 --> 01:25:59.700
I think you're gonna
be a good dad.

01:25:59.700 --> 01:26:01.200
Thanks.

01:26:01.200 --> 01:26:02.700
Yeah, I mean, I don't
know really much about it,

01:26:02.700 --> 01:26:04.600
but I would imagine
being forgiving

01:26:04.600 --> 01:26:05.700
has something to do
with being a good dad,

01:26:05.700 --> 01:26:07.300
and, uh, you and I have
lasted this long,

01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:09.700
so that shows that you're one

01:26:09.700 --> 01:26:12.700
forgiving motherfucker.

01:26:15.700 --> 01:26:17.400
There's something
I should tell you.

01:26:17.400 --> 01:26:18.800
It's cool, man, don't.

01:26:18.800 --> 01:26:19.700
You...

01:26:19.700 --> 01:26:21.600
You're my buddy, that's
all that matters.

01:26:21.600 --> 01:26:24.200
No.

01:26:24.200 --> 01:26:26.800
Look, I'm... I'm
trying to tell you...

01:26:26.800 --> 01:26:27.800
Don't do it, man.

01:26:27.800 --> 01:26:29.700
No, you were right, okay?

01:26:29.700 --> 01:26:33.300
You know, I felt guilty
and I missed my best friend,

01:26:33.300 --> 01:26:36.700
but I had, I had no
right to intrude

01:26:36.700 --> 01:26:37.900
on your life like this, man.

01:26:37.900 --> 01:26:39.600
I just didn't.

01:26:39.600 --> 01:26:41.300
Dude, whatever, man.
Don't even sweat it.

01:26:41.300 --> 01:26:44.500
I don't care.
We're cool.

01:26:44.500 --> 01:26:45.900
I know, it's just
like, you know,

01:26:45.900 --> 01:26:49.300
with the baby coming like
I felt like this was

01:26:49.300 --> 01:26:52.800
my last chance to do
something to feel better

01:26:52.800 --> 01:26:56.800
about myself, and I'm
just fucking sorry, man.

01:26:56.800 --> 01:26:57.800
It is what it is, Mike.

01:26:57.800 --> 01:26:59.700
I don't, I don't give a shit.

01:26:59.700 --> 01:27:01.700
I mean, I'm sorry that I can't

01:27:01.700 --> 01:27:03.300
be this imaginary guy that you

01:27:03.300 --> 01:27:07.000
think is me, you know?

01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:11.500
You're still my buddy.

01:27:11.500 --> 01:27:14.700
Shit.

01:27:14.700 --> 01:27:17.800
Ha-ha-ha!

01:27:17.800 --> 01:27:19.900
That was cool.

01:27:25.900 --> 01:27:30.800
Fuck, man!

01:27:30.800 --> 01:27:31.900
Holy shit.

01:27:31.900 --> 01:27:32.800
Fuck me.

01:27:32.800 --> 01:27:34.800
Holy fuck.

01:27:34.800 --> 01:27:36.900
Oh, my God.

01:27:36.900 --> 01:27:38.400
Burn it.

01:27:53.400 --> 01:27:55.800
Oh, my fucking God.

01:28:21.800 --> 01:28:25.700
That's my bullets.

01:28:25.700 --> 01:28:28.900
Is that it? Is that all of 'em?

01:28:31.900 --> 01:28:34.800
Chris?

01:28:34.800 --> 01:28:37.900
Chris.

01:28:37.900 --> 01:28:38.800
Oh, fuck.

01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:41.000
Oh, fuck!

01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:44.900
No, Mike!

01:28:44.900 --> 01:28:45.700
It's gonna burn, man.

01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:48.900
I need a fucking
hit, let me go!

01:28:52.900 --> 01:28:55.000
Fuck!

01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:16.200
I don't wanna
fucking die, Mike.

01:29:16.200 --> 01:29:18.000
I can't control it, man,
I really fucking can't.

01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:20.100
I need help.

01:29:23.100 --> 01:29:25.100
Can I take you to rehab?

01:29:29.100 --> 01:29:30.900
Yeah.
It has to be now, man.

01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:33.700
You have to fucking
take me right now.

01:29:33.700 --> 01:29:35.400
Okay.

01:29:42.400 --> 01:29:44.500
Oh, shit.

01:29:49.500 --> 01:29:52.000
Hey, we gave that thing
a story with a happy ending.

01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:54.900
Fuck you.

01:30:01.900 --> 01:30:04.100
Oh, God.

01:30:04.100 --> 01:30:07.100
I'm sorry.

01:30:07.100 --> 01:30:11.600
Oh, fuck, I'm sorry.

01:30:11.600 --> 01:30:13.600
I'm sorry.

01:30:20.700 --> 01:30:23.100
Can we try it another way?
