WEBVTT

00:00.945 --> 00:02.012
Previously, on Teen Wolf...

00:02.036 --> 00:03.429
No. Just thinking.

00:03.453 --> 00:04.846
- About what?
- Senior year.

00:04.870 --> 00:06.263
Things have been good.

00:06.287 --> 00:07.684
At some point, the scale
has to tip one way or the other.

00:07.708 --> 00:09.486
Really bad.

00:09.510 --> 00:10.776
Theo?

00:10.800 --> 00:12.066
I want to be
a part of your pack.

00:12.090 --> 00:13.650
I didn't come just
to claim your status.

00:15.049 --> 00:17.594
You were supposed to
remove the obstacles.

00:17.618 --> 00:18.662
Give me another chance.

00:18.686 --> 00:19.686
No second chances.

00:35.169 --> 00:38.215
Most of these schools
require recommendations.

00:38.239 --> 00:41.140
Yours will need to be pretty
stellar considering your GPA.

00:41.709 --> 00:43.042
Tracy?

00:47.114 --> 00:49.426
You feeling
a little overwhelmed?

00:49.450 --> 00:50.761
No, I'm... I'm okay.

00:50.785 --> 00:52.145
Have you been getting
enough sleep?

00:53.120 --> 00:54.931
Not really.

00:54.955 --> 00:56.767
You know, teenagers have
different circadian rhythms.

00:56.791 --> 00:58.434
When you're waking up for school

00:58.458 --> 01:00.103
your body is still
producing melatonin.

01:00.127 --> 01:01.338
You all need more sleep.

01:01.362 --> 01:03.040
It's not just that.

01:03.064 --> 01:04.063
What do you mean?

01:05.099 --> 01:06.099
I get night terrors.

01:07.568 --> 01:09.279
Actual night terrors?

01:09.303 --> 01:10.303
Parasomnia?

01:13.140 --> 01:15.152
I usually don't remember them.

01:15.176 --> 01:16.275
Usually?

01:17.645 --> 01:19.211
Was there one night
you do remember?

04:12.019 --> 04:13.563
My dad found me on the floor,

04:13.587 --> 04:15.432
lying beside the chair.

04:15.456 --> 04:17.300
What about the skylight?
That's the thing.

04:17.324 --> 04:18.902
It doesn't actually open.

04:18.926 --> 04:21.660
It was sealed shut a couple
of years ago to weatherproof it.

04:22.730 --> 04:24.674
So some of it was
definitely a dream?

04:24.698 --> 04:26.309
And some of it wasn't.

04:26.333 --> 04:28.778
Honey, I'm going to
propose that most of it was.

04:28.802 --> 04:33.783
You know, there's a theory that one
of the biological functions of dreaming

04:33.807 --> 04:36.519
is to simulate
threatening events.

04:36.543 --> 04:39.823
It's a way for our brain to
rehearse dealing with them.

04:39.847 --> 04:43.960
I think you're dealing
with normal anxiety, Tracy.

04:43.984 --> 04:46.285
The kind very common to seniors.

04:49.556 --> 04:50.900
I better go.

04:50.924 --> 04:53.325
Class is going
to be starting soon...

04:54.528 --> 04:56.328
and I should...

05:01.402 --> 05:03.001
Tracy, are you okay?

05:03.604 --> 05:05.982
Oh, my God, Tracy.

05:06.006 --> 05:07.651
God! Tracy!

05:07.675 --> 05:08.940
Breathe.

05:23.624 --> 05:24.690
Oh, honey!

05:33.934 --> 05:35.467
Is this common?

06:16.110 --> 06:19.022
Remember, for intramuscular
injections in the hind leg...

06:19.046 --> 06:20.479
Stay clear of the sciatic nerve.

06:21.782 --> 06:24.127
Excellent.

06:24.151 --> 06:26.796
Aspirate back to make sure
you haven't hit a vein.

06:26.820 --> 06:28.060
Then just keep he needle still.

06:36.463 --> 06:38.530
He's a little one, but
his teeth are still sharp.

06:41.034 --> 06:42.100
Sorry, buddy.

06:42.736 --> 06:44.536
Come on. Good boy!

06:46.106 --> 06:47.617
Here you go, Stephanie.

06:47.641 --> 06:48.907
Thank you, Dr. McCall.

06:50.811 --> 06:51.811
I'm not a doctor yet.

07:00.888 --> 07:01.965
Find anything?

07:01.989 --> 07:03.433
Maybe.

07:03.457 --> 07:05.402
Are you sure this guy
was a werewolf?

07:05.426 --> 07:06.736
As far as I can tell,

07:06.760 --> 07:08.905
these claws are actually talons.

07:08.929 --> 07:11.408
In fact, they're the
talons of a harpy eagle,

07:11.432 --> 07:13.176
one of the largest known
birds of prey.

07:13.200 --> 07:15.178
How does a werewolf get talons?

07:15.202 --> 07:17.580
Personally, I'm more
interested in how these talons

07:17.604 --> 07:20.417
somehow were able
to absorb your power.

07:20.441 --> 07:21.885
The only one who should
be able to do that

07:21.909 --> 07:23.069
is a Beta of your own making.

07:24.077 --> 07:25.911
Someone like Liam. Exactly.

07:28.215 --> 07:30.460
And what if I let
someone into my pack?

07:30.484 --> 07:31.616
Like another Beta?

07:32.453 --> 07:33.885
I would normally say no...

07:37.191 --> 07:38.568
but I'm starting to wonder

07:38.592 --> 07:39.969
if the rules
to our supernatural world

07:39.993 --> 07:41.893
aren't as rigid
as I once thought.

07:46.500 --> 07:49.034
Or maybe someone's trying
to change those rules.

07:55.642 --> 07:57.120
I know his family left town

07:57.144 --> 07:59.122
around the time Theo
was nine or ten,

07:59.146 --> 08:00.657
his older sister died in an
accident when he was eight.

08:00.681 --> 08:01.724
Please go to school.

08:01.748 --> 08:03.159
Dad, this kid's a werewolf.

08:03.183 --> 08:05.495
Your best friend is a werewolf.

08:05.519 --> 08:07.931
You are dating a werecoyote.

08:07.955 --> 08:09.699
I'm still don't know
what Kira's supposed to be.

08:09.723 --> 08:12.635
When the flying monkeys
come soaring through this station,

08:12.659 --> 08:14.204
you will have
my undivided attention.

08:14.228 --> 08:17.240
Until then, just go to school.

08:17.264 --> 08:19.476
What did you do? What?

08:19.500 --> 08:21.010
What do you mean,
"What did I do"?

08:21.034 --> 08:22.545
There's something
different about you.

08:22.569 --> 08:23.649
What are you talking about?

08:26.740 --> 08:27.917
What is it?

08:27.941 --> 08:30.086
What's different?

08:30.110 --> 08:33.056
For the love of God,
Stiles, just go to school.

08:33.080 --> 08:35.491
I will go if you promise to do a full
background check of the Raekens.

08:35.515 --> 08:37.326
No.

08:37.350 --> 08:39.162
Know what? Just because I'm
the only law enforcement officer

08:39.186 --> 08:40.230
who knows anything about this,

08:40.254 --> 08:41.597
does not make it
my responsibility

08:41.621 --> 08:43.198
to do something

08:43.222 --> 08:44.823
every time you have
a minor suspicion.

08:46.193 --> 08:48.093
Except you're not the only one.

08:54.601 --> 08:56.001
Parrish!

08:57.538 --> 08:59.115
So you ran a background check,

08:59.139 --> 09:00.750
and all you found
was a speeding ticket?

09:00.774 --> 09:02.919
Speeding ticket signed by
Theo's dad eight years ago.

09:02.943 --> 09:04.142
Which means what?

09:04.845 --> 09:06.089
Who speeds?

09:06.113 --> 09:09.092
People trying to get away
from something.

09:09.116 --> 09:10.476
Well, how many tickets
do you have?

09:10.617 --> 09:12.377
None.

09:12.401 --> 09:14.163
How many would you have if
your dad didn't get you out of them?

09:14.187 --> 09:15.287
Seventeen.

09:18.959 --> 09:21.137
I don't know, Stiles.

09:21.161 --> 09:22.539
I mean,
I see why you're worried.

09:22.563 --> 09:23.840
He's really hot.

09:23.864 --> 09:26.576
He's got like great hair,
perfect body.

09:26.600 --> 09:28.311
You should definitely
feel threatened.

09:28.335 --> 09:29.879
Thank you. Because I do.

09:29.903 --> 09:31.581
Now more than ever.

09:31.605 --> 09:32.915
You want me to torture him?

09:32.939 --> 09:34.250
No, I don't want you
to torture him.

09:34.274 --> 09:35.251
I'm pretty sure I can take him.

09:35.275 --> 09:36.819
I have a plan. All right?

09:36.843 --> 09:37.921
There are steps
to doing this right.

09:37.945 --> 09:39.088
What steps?

09:39.112 --> 09:40.256
We get the story.

09:40.280 --> 09:41.891
Verify the facts.

09:41.915 --> 09:43.226
You find the piece
that doesn't fit

09:43.250 --> 09:44.727
and... and catch him in the act.

09:44.751 --> 09:46.117
That's how you do it.

09:56.296 --> 09:59.242
Why are you so
suspicious of this guy?

09:59.266 --> 10:01.700
Because I remember Theo
from fourth grade. Okay?

10:04.237 --> 10:05.870
That's not Theo.

10:42.142 --> 10:44.153
First day of senior year.

10:44.177 --> 10:46.077
Last first day ever.

10:47.314 --> 10:49.292
This is the one
I was telling you about.

10:49.316 --> 10:51.027
I got it from a rare
book dealer in Germany.

10:51.051 --> 10:52.795
Cost me two hundred bucks,
but it was totally worth it.

10:52.819 --> 10:53.930
You're still reading
about this stuff?

10:53.954 --> 10:55.898
I was attacked
by an armor-plated giant

10:55.922 --> 10:57.200
wearing a bear skull.

10:57.224 --> 10:58.801
It left an impression.

10:58.825 --> 11:00.937
Look. Look. Have you
ever seen anything like this?

11:00.961 --> 11:02.905
Uh, no. Never.

11:02.929 --> 11:05.742
And then there's this whole
section about the Nagual.

11:05.766 --> 11:07.644
Have you ever heard
of the name Tezcat...

11:07.668 --> 11:09.879
Tezcatlipoca.

11:09.903 --> 11:12.070
No. No, never heard of him.

11:14.975 --> 11:16.141
Take your seats, everyone.

11:22.749 --> 11:23.749
Great.

11:33.460 --> 11:34.726
Liam.

11:37.297 --> 11:38.977
You're not gonna just
stand there, are you?

11:40.033 --> 11:41.144
Maybe.

11:41.168 --> 11:42.434
The whole semester?

11:43.370 --> 11:44.370
Maybe.

11:45.806 --> 11:47.772
Liam, have a seat.

12:07.227 --> 12:09.928
All right,
welcome to History 103.

12:24.478 --> 12:25.744
Scott?

12:26.913 --> 12:28.925
Are you in the right class?

12:28.949 --> 12:29.981
AP Biology.

12:31.918 --> 12:33.963
Do you know what AP stands for?

12:33.987 --> 12:35.787
Advanced Placement.

12:45.098 --> 12:46.943
Welcome to AP Biology.

12:46.967 --> 12:49.045
Let's see who's awake.

12:49.069 --> 12:51.380
Can somebody tell me
what plasmids are?

12:51.404 --> 12:53.516
Circular, self-replicating
DNA molecules

12:53.540 --> 12:55.151
often used in cloning proteins.

12:55.175 --> 12:57.035
Nicely stated, Lydia.

12:57.059 --> 12:58.921
Now, can you tell me what
vitamin is absorbed in the stomach

12:58.945 --> 13:00.785
via parietal cell production
of a glycoprotein?

13:03.817 --> 13:05.544
B-12.

13:05.568 --> 13:07.296
Mr. McCall,
did you know the answer?

13:07.320 --> 13:08.831
Um, no.

13:08.855 --> 13:10.500
It's a common test question.

13:10.524 --> 13:11.968
What's your number one
college pick?

13:11.992 --> 13:13.536
Um... Stop saying, "Um."

13:13.560 --> 13:14.871
Sorry.

13:14.895 --> 13:15.938
UC Davis.

13:15.962 --> 13:17.006
Good choice.

13:17.030 --> 13:18.207
It's the best school
on the West Coast

13:18.231 --> 13:20.176
for biological
and physical sciences.

13:20.200 --> 13:22.545
You're in the right class if
that's what you're hoping for.

13:22.569 --> 13:24.435
Who else thinks
they're in the right class?

13:30.510 --> 13:32.187
Good.

13:32.211 --> 13:33.890
Then you should all be
prepared for the test tomorrow.

13:33.914 --> 13:36.092
Don't be so disappointed.

13:36.116 --> 13:38.561
This test is specifically
to help you determine

13:38.585 --> 13:40.930
whether you should
actually be in AP Biology.

13:40.954 --> 13:43.065
You have two weeks to drop.

13:43.089 --> 13:45.835
Tomorrow's test will just weed
out the ones who shouldn't be here.

13:45.859 --> 13:47.458
And that could be any of you.

13:51.164 --> 13:52.875
Hey!

13:52.899 --> 13:54.343
You. You're coming with me.
Come on.

13:54.367 --> 13:55.478
I've got a free period.

13:55.502 --> 13:57.246
So do I.
And so does Theo Raeken.

13:57.270 --> 13:58.570
Let's go.

14:01.241 --> 14:04.987
Look, I'm not saying I believe
all of it a hundred percent,

14:05.011 --> 14:07.023
but people around us
seem to know things.

14:07.047 --> 14:08.546
Like Lydia, she knows things.

14:09.883 --> 14:11.460
Dude, it's the first day
at school.

14:11.484 --> 14:14.263
Shouldn't you be thinking
about other things like...

14:14.287 --> 14:15.287
Like the soccer team?

14:16.389 --> 14:19.234
What do you think
I'm going to do?

14:19.258 --> 14:22.104
Follow them out to the field and watch
them practice while I pretend to study?

14:22.128 --> 14:24.128
It's warm out. They'll
probably gonna be shirtless.

14:29.135 --> 14:30.535
I'll see you in Physics.

14:40.213 --> 14:43.893
Nice shorts. Yeah, thanks.

14:43.917 --> 14:46.195
You know, I was wondering if you were
still pissed off about the sixth grade,

14:46.219 --> 14:47.930
but I guess you cleared that up.

14:47.954 --> 14:48.954
I'm not pissed off, Liam.

14:50.123 --> 14:51.456
I'm vengeful.

16:59.085 --> 17:01.052
There's nothing there.
There's nothing there.

17:02.689 --> 17:03.733
There's nothing there.

17:03.757 --> 17:05.534
There's nothing there.

17:05.558 --> 17:07.358
There's nothing there.
There's nothing there.

17:15.335 --> 17:16.768
Tracy?

17:17.670 --> 17:19.203
Are you all right?

17:21.074 --> 17:22.507
How about we go outside?

17:54.174 --> 17:57.219
I was skating in a neighbor's
empty pool, trying to do a handplant.

17:57.243 --> 17:58.487
Nobody was home.

17:58.511 --> 18:00.556
I'm not that good
of a skateboarder,

18:00.580 --> 18:02.825
but I guess I was feeling
pretty determined

18:02.849 --> 18:04.409
because I completely
lost track of time.

18:05.718 --> 18:07.630
I didn't even realize
that was night

18:07.654 --> 18:10.066
until the yard lights came on.

18:10.090 --> 18:12.368
Like I said, I wasn't very good.

18:12.392 --> 18:14.659
On my last try
I went down and hit hard.

18:15.728 --> 18:18.140
Really hard.

18:18.164 --> 18:21.277
I was sitting there
at the bottom of the pool

18:21.301 --> 18:23.134
and I realized something.

18:25.105 --> 18:26.625
I never heard the board
come back down.

18:46.526 --> 18:48.537
It came at me fast.

18:48.561 --> 18:49.805
I barely had a chance
to turn around

18:49.829 --> 18:51.129
before it bit me.

18:51.865 --> 18:52.865
Right here.

18:54.834 --> 18:57.480
It wasn't an accident.
He wanted to turn you.

18:57.504 --> 18:59.882
Right. So why aren't you
part of his pack then?

18:59.906 --> 19:01.617
Why didn't he come back for you?

19:01.641 --> 19:03.886
Because by the time of my
first full moon, he was dead.

19:03.910 --> 19:05.754
How did you know that?

19:05.778 --> 19:07.623
I met another one of his
pack a couple weeks later.

19:07.647 --> 19:09.892
He told me the Alpha that bit me

19:09.916 --> 19:11.360
was killed by two
of his own Betas.

19:11.384 --> 19:12.683
They were twins.

19:15.922 --> 19:19.502
Scott, listen to my pulse.
I'm telling the truth.

19:19.526 --> 19:21.370
Right. Or you just know
how to steady your heart rate

19:21.394 --> 19:22.674
while you're lying your ass off.

19:24.297 --> 19:25.741
Why would I lie?

19:25.765 --> 19:27.543
Because maybe you're not
who you say you are.

19:27.567 --> 19:28.633
Okay.

19:30.203 --> 19:32.370
In the fourth grade
you had an inhaler,

19:33.339 --> 19:34.717
I had one too.

19:34.741 --> 19:36.185
I remember this day

19:36.209 --> 19:37.653
where I ended up
in the nurse's office

19:37.677 --> 19:39.221
with an asthma attack.
A bad one.

19:39.245 --> 19:41.490
I was waiting
to be taken to the ER.

19:41.514 --> 19:42.874
You were waiting
for the Principal.

19:43.950 --> 19:45.528
You told me what would happen

19:45.552 --> 19:47.163
when you go to the ER
for asthma.

19:47.187 --> 19:48.987
How they give you oxygen,
an IV of prednisone.

19:50.523 --> 19:51.756
You made it sound easy.

19:53.226 --> 19:54.426
Like everything would be okay.

19:57.664 --> 19:59.808
I've been by myself
this whole time.

19:59.832 --> 20:01.877
Everybody knows
that lone wolves,

20:01.901 --> 20:03.501
they don't make it on their own.

20:05.371 --> 20:07.538
I swear I'm that same kid
from fourth grade.

20:09.342 --> 20:10.342
I was hoping you are too.

20:16.849 --> 20:18.883
I better not be late for class.

20:19.886 --> 20:21.330
You're not the only ones

20:21.354 --> 20:22.754
I need to make
a good impression on.

20:35.301 --> 20:37.546
No. Don't give me that look.

20:37.570 --> 20:39.815
We have to give people the
benefit of the doubt sometimes.

20:39.839 --> 20:41.450
Not this time. All right.

20:41.474 --> 20:43.335
I'm right.

20:43.359 --> 20:45.221
There's something off
about him. I can feel it.

20:45.245 --> 20:47.011
Lydia's the psychic. Not you.

20:49.249 --> 20:50.726
She's not psychic.
She's a Banshee. Okay?

20:50.750 --> 20:52.383
There's a difference.

20:53.853 --> 20:55.664
Yeah.

20:55.688 --> 20:58.400
I know what parasomnia is, Mom.

20:58.424 --> 21:00.970
But what about the feathers?

21:00.994 --> 21:03.339
People with night terrors
have done far stranger things

21:03.363 --> 21:05.263
than eating their own pillows.

21:06.866 --> 21:08.444
And anyway, I already told
her to take the rest of the day off,

21:08.468 --> 21:09.878
but she said she didn't
want to miss the first day.

21:09.902 --> 21:11.680
Let me try.

21:11.704 --> 21:12.748
I don't have any more classes.

21:12.772 --> 21:14.350
I can take her home
and talk to her.

21:14.374 --> 21:16.385
Lydia, she's having
trouble sleeping.

21:16.409 --> 21:17.853
If she needs help beyond that,

21:17.877 --> 21:19.622
we'll find her
professional help.

21:19.646 --> 21:20.811
Got it?

21:21.614 --> 21:22.847
I couldn't agree more.

21:29.422 --> 21:31.822
I don't see any signs
of an attempted forced entry.

21:32.625 --> 21:33.625
The latch seems okay.

21:34.861 --> 21:36.772
You said something
about birds, Tracy?

21:36.796 --> 21:38.707
The bird was at the skylight.

21:38.731 --> 21:39.742
The one that woke me up.

21:39.766 --> 21:40.898
Can I take a look?

21:46.606 --> 21:48.966
Tracy, you said the skylight
was sealed for weatherproofing.

21:49.042 --> 21:50.042
Yeah. Why?

22:00.586 --> 22:01.686
Anything?

22:08.594 --> 22:09.894
No. Nothing.

22:33.686 --> 22:34.930
Ease into it, Malia.

22:34.954 --> 22:36.387
Easy does it.

22:48.801 --> 22:51.013
Okay, I think
we're all good for today.

22:51.037 --> 22:52.136
Yeah.

22:59.045 --> 23:00.144
How did I do?

23:01.748 --> 23:02.908
There's room for improvement.

23:14.160 --> 23:15.800
So you found something?
Another signature.

23:16.929 --> 23:18.640
This is Theo's dad's signature

23:18.664 --> 23:20.376
on a speeding ticket
from eight years ago.

23:20.400 --> 23:22.544
And this is his dad's
signature on a transfer form

23:22.568 --> 23:24.648
to Beacon Hills High School
from just a few days ago.

23:25.772 --> 23:27.516
How did you get
his transfer form?

23:27.540 --> 23:28.951
You didn't break into
the Administration Office?

23:28.975 --> 23:30.975
No, I did not break into
the Administration Office.

23:32.545 --> 23:34.156
Okay, I might have broken
into the Administration Office.

23:34.180 --> 23:36.091
Can we just focus on
the signatures, please?

23:36.115 --> 23:37.115
They're different.

23:38.851 --> 23:40.095
They're sort of different.

23:40.119 --> 23:42.064
They're completely different.
Come on. Look.

23:42.088 --> 23:43.865
The garlands don't match,

23:43.889 --> 23:45.667
the undulations of the
sinuous stroke are totally off.

23:45.691 --> 23:47.136
And look, look at this.

23:47.160 --> 23:48.680
Perfect example
of the Criminal Tremor.

23:49.862 --> 23:51.974
So now, Theo is Theo,

23:51.998 --> 23:53.675
but his parents
aren't his parents?

23:53.699 --> 23:55.243
Someone's not someone.

23:55.267 --> 23:56.812
And when I figure out
who that someone really is,

23:56.836 --> 23:57.935
someone's in big trouble.

23:59.005 --> 24:00.582
But no one's done
anything wrong.

24:00.606 --> 24:02.216
Yet.

24:02.240 --> 24:03.852
If Theo's parents
are both psychotic killers

24:03.876 --> 24:05.687
then obviously, we should
not trust him, right?

24:05.711 --> 24:07.311
My parents are Peter
and the Desert Wolf.

24:09.882 --> 24:10.948
Okay...

24:12.485 --> 24:13.896
It's fine. You know what?

24:13.920 --> 24:15.097
I'll figure it out myself.
Right?

24:15.121 --> 24:17.099
I don't need you or you or you.

24:17.123 --> 24:18.589
I don't need anyone.

24:21.861 --> 24:23.227
What's a Criminal Tremor?

24:25.798 --> 24:26.864
It doesn't matter.

24:29.669 --> 24:31.113
I can't do anything
official right now,

24:31.137 --> 24:32.614
but I can come back
after my shift tonight

24:32.638 --> 24:34.183
and watch the house
for a couple of hours.

24:34.207 --> 24:35.484
I'll keep you company.

24:35.508 --> 24:36.618
I think I'll be okay.

24:36.642 --> 24:38.187
But this is your own time.

24:38.211 --> 24:40.522
I wouldn't do it if I didn't think
something strange was going on.

24:40.546 --> 24:42.825
I also owe you. For what?

24:42.849 --> 24:45.527
Three weeks of digging through every
piece of old literature and mythology

24:45.551 --> 24:47.496
trying to figure out the something
strange going on with me.

24:47.520 --> 24:49.019
But we never figured it out.

24:49.922 --> 24:51.166
I'll bring you coffee.

24:51.190 --> 24:52.468
Don't you have school tomorrow?

24:52.492 --> 24:53.635
One class.

24:53.659 --> 24:55.103
How can you only have one class?

24:55.127 --> 24:56.839
I had enough credits
to graduate last year.

24:56.863 --> 24:58.106
And I will bring you coffee

24:58.130 --> 24:59.163
at midnight if I want to.

25:01.100 --> 25:02.611
Medium Americano.

25:02.635 --> 25:03.701
Black.

25:24.023 --> 25:25.200
I told you
he was up to something.

25:25.224 --> 25:27.352
We just spent three hours

25:27.376 --> 25:29.505
watching this dude play
video games in his bedroom.

25:29.529 --> 25:31.173
He better be out here
covering up a mass murder.

25:31.197 --> 25:32.530
Let's find out.

25:36.936 --> 25:38.647
You still got his scent?

25:38.671 --> 25:39.671
Don't need it.

25:45.678 --> 25:47.388
What? What's wrong?

25:47.412 --> 25:49.124
I forgot, I was supposed to
meet Mason at the school gym.

25:49.148 --> 25:50.592
Okay, why didn't you
just tell him?

25:50.616 --> 25:52.895
Tell him what? Anything.

25:52.919 --> 25:54.863
I can't just tell him
anything. Why not?

25:54.887 --> 25:56.899
Because I haven't...

25:56.923 --> 25:58.100
I haven't told him everything.

25:58.124 --> 25:59.535
Still? We said it was okay.

25:59.559 --> 26:00.999
Yeah, I know,
but it's not that easy.

26:02.228 --> 26:03.972
It's a lot to accept.

26:03.996 --> 26:06.208
He watched my dad blow up
a Berserker with a land mine.

26:06.232 --> 26:10.212
I think the groundwork's been
pretty thoroughly laid for acceptance.

26:10.236 --> 26:12.014
Scott and I have been
through this. Okay?

26:12.038 --> 26:14.049
More than once.

26:14.073 --> 26:15.593
It's always been better
when they know.

26:18.644 --> 26:20.255
But what if he freaks out?

26:20.279 --> 26:22.090
What if he doesn't want
to talk to me?

26:22.114 --> 26:23.892
What if he tries to stab me
with something silver?

26:23.916 --> 26:25.583
Or what if...

26:30.323 --> 26:31.622
What the hell are you doing?

26:33.025 --> 26:34.258
I...

26:35.828 --> 26:37.072
There he is.

26:37.096 --> 26:38.662
Hurry up. Stop screwing around.

26:53.980 --> 26:54.980
Come on.

27:07.059 --> 27:08.092
Try and get his scent.

27:09.028 --> 27:10.294
Get anything?

27:10.930 --> 27:11.996
Soap.

27:12.932 --> 27:14.142
It's nice. It smells good.

27:14.166 --> 27:16.044
Not his soap,
his emotional state.

27:16.068 --> 27:17.179
Chemosignals, remember?

27:17.203 --> 27:18.636
Oh, yeah. Okay.

27:22.341 --> 27:23.407
I...

27:23.943 --> 27:25.053
He's sad.

27:25.077 --> 27:26.143
He's sad?

27:27.413 --> 27:29.380
Well, not just sad...

27:30.983 --> 27:33.350
It's more like grief.

27:35.054 --> 27:36.120
Grief?

27:48.000 --> 27:49.099
Oh, my God!

27:50.036 --> 27:51.735
Go! We have to go. What? Why?

27:54.874 --> 27:55.973
Go! Right now. Just go.

27:55.997 --> 27:57.096
That's the bridge where
they found his sister.

27:57.120 --> 27:58.220
What sister? The one that
got lost and died from exposure.

27:58.244 --> 27:59.421
He's leaving a flower for her.

27:59.445 --> 28:01.311
That doesn't sound evil. I know.

28:11.123 --> 28:12.356
What you guys doing?

28:18.264 --> 28:19.329
Whoa.

28:21.934 --> 28:24.179
Why do I get the feeling this
kid's tougher than he looks?

28:24.203 --> 28:26.048
Only when we
let him off his leash.

28:26.072 --> 28:28.684
Stiles, we were in
Little League together.

28:28.708 --> 28:30.040
Why are you so suspicious of me?

28:34.113 --> 28:35.312
Because of these.

28:37.750 --> 28:40.228
One's a speeding ticket signed
by your dad eight years ago.

28:40.252 --> 28:42.330
The other one's a signature on
a transfer form to Beacon High.

28:42.354 --> 28:43.821
They're different.

28:45.324 --> 28:48.170
Yeah, they do look
a little different.

28:48.194 --> 28:49.337
No, they're totally different.

28:49.361 --> 28:51.106
Signed by two different people.

28:51.130 --> 28:52.708
So my dad's not my dad?

28:52.732 --> 28:53.942
Like he's an imposter?

28:53.966 --> 28:55.466
Yeah, something like that.

28:57.970 --> 28:59.147
Who do you think I am?

28:59.171 --> 29:00.882
We don't know yet.

29:00.906 --> 29:03.185
Want me to give you
a DNA sample or something?

29:03.209 --> 29:05.776
No. I don't have anything from
the fourth grade to match it to.

29:10.816 --> 29:13.083
You know, Stiles,
I came back here for Scott...

29:15.287 --> 29:16.527
but I also came back for you.

29:18.290 --> 29:20.068
Someone like you.

29:20.092 --> 29:22.337
Someone who's willing
to walk into the woods

29:22.361 --> 29:24.321
in the middle of the night
to protect his friends.

29:26.799 --> 29:28.210
I don't have anyone like that,

29:28.234 --> 29:29.399
but Scott does.

29:30.402 --> 29:31.535
You all do.

29:34.440 --> 29:35.873
I know I'm in the right place.

29:36.809 --> 29:38.542
I'm meant to be here.

29:39.545 --> 29:41.278
I'm meant to be part
of this pack.

29:48.120 --> 29:49.386
I think it's pretty secure now.

29:58.197 --> 30:00.798
Look, I've got to meet a
client at the courthouse. Okay?

30:01.433 --> 30:02.866
But I'll be back soon.

30:15.147 --> 30:16.880
I won't let anything
happen to you.

30:42.408 --> 30:43.473
Find anything?

30:44.143 --> 30:45.309
Nope.

30:46.478 --> 30:47.544
I fell in a hole.

30:52.218 --> 30:54.429
It was the bridge where
his sister died, wasn't it?

30:54.453 --> 30:55.931
Yes, it was. Very embarrassing.

30:55.955 --> 30:57.154
So we are gonna leave now.

31:00.259 --> 31:02.270
Son of a...

31:02.294 --> 31:04.573
Liam, just do me a favor,

31:04.597 --> 31:06.477
get in the car and turn
the ignition when I say.

31:16.342 --> 31:18.053
Stiles? Be with you in a sec.

31:18.077 --> 31:19.309
Try it.

31:23.883 --> 31:24.960
Stiles.

31:24.984 --> 31:26.895
Yes. Okay, we followed him
out here.

31:26.919 --> 31:28.063
What do you want me to say?

31:28.087 --> 31:29.197
That I'm a stalker, huh?

31:29.221 --> 31:30.565
That I'm crazy,
totally paranoid?

31:30.589 --> 31:31.869
None of this is new information.

31:35.227 --> 31:37.372
Now you're gonna try to at least
give him the benefit of the doubt?

31:37.396 --> 31:39.207
I give people the
benefit of the doubt.

31:39.231 --> 31:41.298
I've given a lot of benefit
to a lot of people.

31:44.470 --> 31:45.535
Like Derek?

31:47.339 --> 31:48.383
Kira?

31:48.407 --> 31:49.606
Liam?

31:50.643 --> 31:51.643
I was right about Peter.

31:53.012 --> 31:54.344
Try it again.

31:58.651 --> 32:01.129
You know, I bet you still think

32:01.153 --> 32:02.664
that there's something
about him that can be saved.

32:02.688 --> 32:03.688
Maybe.

32:06.258 --> 32:07.925
Try it again.

32:13.598 --> 32:14.209
Why can't you trust anyone?

32:14.233 --> 32:15.313
Because you trust everyone!

32:20.673 --> 32:22.284
Are you okay?

32:22.308 --> 32:24.452
I'm fine.

32:24.476 --> 32:26.288
You could've broken it.
It's not broken.

32:26.312 --> 32:27.544
Let me see it. I'm fine.

32:28.280 --> 32:29.413
Let me see it.

33:43.022 --> 33:44.332
Hey.

33:44.356 --> 33:46.301
Hey. Sorry I'm late.

33:46.325 --> 33:48.370
Oh, no, you're not late.
You missed it.

33:48.394 --> 33:49.637
I worked out.

33:49.661 --> 33:51.072
For two hours.

33:51.096 --> 33:52.540
Yeah, I know. I forgot.

33:52.564 --> 33:54.097
And I'm gonna tell you why.

33:57.136 --> 33:59.736
Actually, I'm gonna
tell you a lot of things.

34:01.140 --> 34:02.350
A lot of hard to believe things.

34:02.374 --> 34:04.619
Really hard to believe.

34:04.643 --> 34:06.254
There's a wolf.
Yeah, I'm getting to that.

34:06.278 --> 34:10.080
No. There's a wolf
right behind you.

34:18.190 --> 34:19.556
That's a wolf.

35:02.134 --> 35:03.494
There's something
I gotta tell you.

35:06.805 --> 35:08.438
You're a werewolf.

35:55.554 --> 35:58.221
So, how come you never told me
why you want to go to UC Davis?

35:58.891 --> 36:00.668
It's a really good school.

36:00.692 --> 36:02.170
Not too far from the Bay Area.

36:02.194 --> 36:03.838
It also has the best program

36:03.862 --> 36:06.474
for biological
and physical sciences.

36:06.498 --> 36:08.498
Perfect for someone who
wants to be a veterinarian.

36:10.369 --> 36:11.846
Why wouldn't you tell me?

36:11.870 --> 36:13.515
Were you worried
what I would think?

36:13.539 --> 36:15.605
No. No, not at all.

36:16.808 --> 36:19.354
It's actually because...

36:19.378 --> 36:22.445
I'm worried I'm not
smart enough to make it.

36:31.557 --> 36:32.889
You'll make it.

36:57.649 --> 37:00.049
As far as I can tell, no one's
gone in and no one's come out.

37:02.788 --> 37:04.254
Sorry I wasted your time.

37:05.757 --> 37:06.957
Not a total waste.

37:13.732 --> 37:14.831
I'm just glad Tracy's okay.

37:56.275 --> 37:57.641
There's nothing there.

37:58.644 --> 37:59.644
There's nothing...

38:12.824 --> 38:13.901
It's not real.

38:13.925 --> 38:15.358
I'm sleeping...

38:16.061 --> 38:17.839
I'm just sleeping...

38:17.863 --> 38:21.064
No, Tracy, you're awakening.

38:23.468 --> 38:24.701
God!

39:14.686 --> 39:17.532
Usually, we wait until
they do something wrong

39:17.556 --> 39:18.966
before we declare them guilty.

39:18.990 --> 39:20.868
Well, he's guilty of something.

39:20.892 --> 39:22.392
Accusations require proof.

39:23.662 --> 39:26.129
And proof
always trumps instinct.

39:26.932 --> 39:28.876
It has to. I know, Dad.

39:28.900 --> 39:30.033
Let it go, Stiles.

39:30.669 --> 39:31.913
Get some sleep.

39:31.937 --> 39:33.603
Hey, Dad.

39:37.509 --> 39:39.749
I got it. There's something
different. I know what it is.

39:41.380 --> 39:42.445
Okay.

39:43.715 --> 39:45.475
You're not wearing
your wedding ring anymore.

39:57.596 --> 39:59.028
You're sure this kid's guilty?

39:59.698 --> 40:00.942
Absolutely.

40:00.966 --> 40:02.665
Then all you gotta do is wait.

40:03.835 --> 40:06.047
If they're really guilty,

40:06.071 --> 40:07.937
eventually, they make a mistake.

40:09.775 --> 40:11.074
They always make a mistake.

40:19.851 --> 40:21.050
You were told to practice.

40:24.623 --> 40:27.023
It was supposed to be
indistinguishable from the original.

40:28.560 --> 40:29.871
It was supposed to be perfect.

40:29.895 --> 40:31.995
I swear, I practiced.

40:33.532 --> 40:35.042
Hundreds upon hundreds of times.

40:35.066 --> 40:36.711
I wouldn't say hundreds.

40:36.735 --> 40:41.549
There is one way a false
signature can be explained.

40:41.573 --> 40:43.533
It's not easy to write
when you're wearing a cast.

40:46.745 --> 40:47.911
Is it?
