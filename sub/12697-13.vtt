WEBVTT

00:03.237 --> 00:04.672
This year's

00:04.772 --> 00:09.009
Webicon Web Icon Lifetime
Achievement Award recipient:

00:09.110 --> 00:10.178
Carly Shay.

00:10.278 --> 00:11.879
-Whoo!
-Step one,

00:11.979 --> 00:13.013
kiss Wes.
[kiss]

00:13.114 --> 00:14.315
Step two, smile.

00:14.415 --> 00:17.385
Step three,
humbly wave at my fans.

00:18.452 --> 00:20.088
Lifetime achievement award?

00:20.188 --> 00:22.123
[laughs]
You're so old.

00:22.223 --> 00:24.825
I'm a dewey 27.

00:25.493 --> 00:27.195
And this award is a big deal.

00:27.295 --> 00:28.596
It's been a hard year,

00:28.696 --> 00:30.764
starting up my channel again
all by myself.

00:30.864 --> 00:32.266
All by yourself?

00:32.366 --> 00:34.968
No emotional support
or fancy studio in my apartment

00:35.069 --> 00:37.605
or anyone dressing up
as a baby for you?

00:37.705 --> 00:40.441
You should probably thank me
first.

00:40.541 --> 00:42.310
You're somewhere
between God and my manicurist.

00:42.410 --> 00:46.780
And now we get to celebrate you
at the new and improved Webicon.

00:46.880 --> 00:48.782
Or I guess the full title
is now "Webicon,

00:48.882 --> 00:51.885
sponsored by
YesIStillUseChecks.com."

00:51.985 --> 00:55.656
I'm just glad they pivoted
from a giant, sweaty convention

00:55.756 --> 00:57.057
to a glamping retreat

00:57.158 --> 00:59.560
for "forward thinkers
of the online era."

00:59.660 --> 01:02.263
Plus, a pitch-fest
for new tech ventures.

01:02.363 --> 01:03.864
A field full of rich people

01:03.964 --> 01:06.066
who don't know what to do
with their money.

01:06.167 --> 01:08.035
And I get to tell 'em.

01:08.136 --> 01:11.004
Well, it better be awesome--
I got Dutch on the music lineup,

01:11.105 --> 01:13.241
and I promised her,
because you promised me,

01:13.341 --> 01:15.809
so it's a blockchain promise.

01:16.610 --> 01:18.078
As requested,

01:18.179 --> 01:20.114
useless, nontoxic buy spray.

01:20.214 --> 01:22.116
But let the record show
I'm still solidly behind

01:22.216 --> 01:24.418
Harper's idea
for mosquito net jumpsuits.

01:24.518 --> 01:26.086
Said that as a joke.

01:26.187 --> 01:27.888
Look, we're headed to an island

01:27.988 --> 01:29.490
with no ferry service
and spotty cellular.

01:29.590 --> 01:30.891
I just want to be prepared.

01:30.991 --> 01:32.726
The tree houses have
electricity, plumbing,

01:32.826 --> 01:34.962
[laughs]:
and an hourly tea ceremony.

01:35.062 --> 01:37.165
My Eagle Scout here wants
to bring a generator,

01:37.265 --> 01:38.599
iodine and rations.

01:38.699 --> 01:40.434
Well, at least
you let me pack candles,

01:40.534 --> 01:41.902
so in case the power goes out,

01:42.002 --> 01:44.004
I can still see
your gorgeous face.

01:44.805 --> 01:47.441
Oh, get a tree house, you two.

01:47.541 --> 01:49.443
Oh, we will. We all will.

01:49.543 --> 01:51.945
We're gonna have
the best weekend ever.

01:52.045 --> 01:53.947
Everybody, hands in.

01:54.047 --> 01:55.316
Webicon.

01:55.416 --> 01:57.785
[ALL]:
Webicon!

01:59.787 --> 02:02.623
Why don't the trees have houses?

02:02.723 --> 02:04.292
What are we supposed to eat?

02:04.392 --> 02:05.793
Where is everyone?!

02:05.893 --> 02:08.196
Are they all having fun
without us? On a yacht?

02:08.296 --> 02:10.130
Harper, speak to the concierge

02:10.231 --> 02:12.333
about getting us an invite
to the yacht.

02:12.433 --> 02:13.567
-[SPENCER]: Mm.
-Please.

02:13.667 --> 02:14.902
Come on, guys,

02:15.002 --> 02:17.171
we just have to roll
with the punches,

02:17.271 --> 02:19.307
and it'll be an adventure.

02:19.407 --> 02:21.141
Webicon!

02:22.276 --> 02:24.578
Yeah, I say we eat her first.

02:30.984 --> 02:32.152
* I know *

02:32.253 --> 02:33.621
* You see *

02:33.721 --> 02:35.623
* Somehow the world
will change for me *

02:35.723 --> 02:39.059
* And be so wonderful *

02:40.093 --> 02:42.596
* Live life, breathe air *

02:42.696 --> 02:44.698
* I know somehow
we're gonna get there *

02:44.798 --> 02:47.568
* And feel so wonderful *

02:49.503 --> 02:52.840
* It's all for real *

02:52.940 --> 02:54.708
* I'm telling you
just how I feel *

02:54.808 --> 02:58.846
* So wake up
the members of my nation *

02:58.946 --> 03:01.048
* It's your time to be *

03:01.148 --> 03:03.884
* There's no chance
unless you take one *

03:03.984 --> 03:06.420
* And the time to see
the brighter side *

03:06.520 --> 03:09.557
* Of every situation *

03:09.657 --> 03:11.692
* Some things are meant to be *

03:11.792 --> 03:15.363
* So give your best
and leave the rest to me *

03:15.463 --> 03:17.831
-* Leave it all to me *
-* Leave it all to me *

03:17.931 --> 03:19.600
* Leave it all to me *

03:19.700 --> 03:23.237
* Just leave it all to me. *

03:28.576 --> 03:31.078
Never ask how I got this tarp.

03:32.079 --> 03:33.847
Is this hell?

03:33.947 --> 03:34.815
No.

03:34.915 --> 03:37.351
Hell at least has Lil Nas X.

03:37.451 --> 03:40.187
Dutch is the only one from
the music lineup who showed.

03:40.288 --> 03:41.789
I guess all the rich people
already figured out

03:41.889 --> 03:43.190
what to do with their money--
they used it

03:43.291 --> 03:44.892
to get on the last helicopter
out of here.

03:44.992 --> 03:47.528
Don't worry, we're
still gonna have a great time.

03:47.628 --> 03:49.963
I'm almost done
completing inventory

03:50.063 --> 03:52.032
and formulating
a list of tasks.

03:52.132 --> 03:54.402
See? Tasks.

03:54.502 --> 03:56.670
I made this dress for Dutch.

03:56.770 --> 03:58.939
She was gonna sing and dance
over a fire,

03:59.039 --> 04:00.941
and then when her fans wanted
an encore,

04:01.041 --> 04:04.244
they would scream:
"S'more! S'more!"

04:04.345 --> 04:06.447
I guess we'll have to eat it.

04:06.547 --> 04:07.615
All right, here's the deal.

04:07.715 --> 04:09.417
I talked
to the person in charge

04:09.517 --> 04:12.853
before she was whisked away
by six competing documentarians.

04:12.953 --> 04:15.756
They planned to have
luxury tree houses,

04:15.856 --> 04:17.358
a pitch-fest,
and a sick music lineup,

04:17.458 --> 04:19.927
but without money,
that plan never went beyond:

04:20.027 --> 04:21.929
"Let's have luxury tree houses,

04:22.029 --> 04:24.264
a pitch-fest,
and a sick music lineup."

04:24.365 --> 04:26.667
We have a sick music lineup.

04:26.767 --> 04:28.302
-Dutch can still perform.
-No.

04:28.402 --> 04:31.171
No, no, they said singing
attracts the possums.

04:32.540 --> 04:34.007
Dutch, I'm sorry.

04:34.107 --> 04:36.310
I will sew you a tent
out of bark if I have to.

04:36.410 --> 04:40.314
Mm-mm. I will take a hotel room,
please, and thank you.

04:41.915 --> 04:43.917
So, are they sending boats?

04:44.017 --> 04:46.253
Helicopters? Amazon drones?

04:46.354 --> 04:48.756
Not until Monday.
Hey, where'd you get the tarp?

04:48.856 --> 04:50.358
[grunts gibberish]

04:50.458 --> 04:52.125
What are we gonna do?

04:52.225 --> 04:54.227
Don't worry about it, all right?
We have just enough water,

04:54.328 --> 04:56.797
and the festival left us
non-FDA-approved protein bars,

04:56.897 --> 04:59.633
but, uh,
they are the blueberry flavor.

04:59.733 --> 05:01.101
I'll starve.

05:01.201 --> 05:03.571
I just really need you
to take this seriously.

05:03.671 --> 05:05.706
I am. But since you've got
survival covered,

05:05.806 --> 05:07.975
there's no reason I can't be
in charge of having fun.

05:08.075 --> 05:10.811
Uh, we could go on a sunset
hike, make flower crowns,

05:10.911 --> 05:12.245
go skinny-dipping.

05:12.346 --> 05:15.416
Sprained ankle, poison ivy,
penis parasites.

05:16.216 --> 05:18.352
I'm just trying to make lemonade
out of lemons.

05:18.452 --> 05:19.487
Oh, you brought lemons?

05:19.587 --> 05:21.355
No.

05:21.455 --> 05:22.690
* *

05:22.790 --> 05:26.159
Ah, good luck getting our food,
bears!

05:26.259 --> 05:27.495
Wait.

05:27.595 --> 05:30.698
If the bears can't get the food,
will they eat us?

05:31.699 --> 05:34.167
Enjoy our food, bears.

05:35.603 --> 05:37.070
[sighs heavily]

05:37.170 --> 05:39.740
I'm so bummed the pitch-fest
is canceled.

05:39.840 --> 05:41.208
Do you think this is a sign?

05:41.308 --> 05:43.677
Maybe it's time I hang up
my entrepreneurial hat.

05:43.777 --> 05:46.714
If you mean your
Rite Aid fedora, then yes.

05:47.748 --> 05:49.617
You can't give up. Let me help.

05:49.717 --> 05:52.252
No. We both agreed that we were
lucky our friendship survived

05:52.352 --> 05:54.755
you investing
in my first failed start-up.

05:54.855 --> 05:57.591
You are not allowed to give me
any more money.

05:57.691 --> 05:58.992
And I won't.

05:59.092 --> 06:01.094
But I bet I can find
a different rich idiot

06:01.194 --> 06:03.130
to trick into losing
all of their money.

06:03.230 --> 06:07.367
There must be someone here
who was too dumb to make it out.

06:07.468 --> 06:08.469
Yeah.

06:08.569 --> 06:09.870
Us.

06:11.004 --> 06:12.873
You're not going to find anyone.

06:12.973 --> 06:14.875
I'm just not cut out
for the tech world.

06:14.975 --> 06:16.977
Maybe it's time
I find something else.

06:17.077 --> 06:18.612
[SPENCER]:
Hey...

06:19.379 --> 06:21.915
Should we tell him he
just walked through poison oak?

06:22.015 --> 06:25.185
He'll find out soon enough.

06:25.285 --> 06:27.688
Sorry I got you to bring
Double Dutch.

06:27.788 --> 06:29.222
She's a lot.

06:29.322 --> 06:31.892
Hey, she's my boss--
only I'm allowed to say that.

06:31.992 --> 06:33.927
And Wes is quite
the survivalist

06:34.027 --> 06:36.029
and very helpful
and not at all annoying.

06:36.129 --> 06:39.132
[like Wes]: Hey, don't eat the
red berries-- they're poisonous.

06:39.232 --> 06:40.300
Hey!

06:40.400 --> 06:42.770
[chuckles]
But that was dead-on.

06:42.870 --> 06:45.305
Wes is just
such a planner, and...

06:45.405 --> 06:48.742
I love that, but sometimes he
has trouble being spontaneous.

06:48.842 --> 06:50.277
I want to survive, too.

06:50.377 --> 06:53.146
Doesn't mean I can't also have
a flower crown.

06:53.246 --> 06:55.382
I'm on a trip
with my favorite people

06:55.483 --> 06:57.217
who I promised a great time.

06:57.317 --> 06:59.219
I need to at least try
to make that happen.

06:59.319 --> 07:01.421
I don't know how to work
this compass.

07:01.522 --> 07:02.990
Oh, uh, try turning it off

07:03.090 --> 07:04.792
-and then back on.
-Oh.

07:06.326 --> 07:07.828
I feel bad, but...

07:07.928 --> 07:12.365
I keep thinking about if I
were here with my ex-boyfriend,

07:12.466 --> 07:15.035
who shall not be named.

07:15.135 --> 07:15.936
Beau?

07:16.036 --> 07:17.337
Guess we're naming him.

07:17.437 --> 07:19.773
He'd already have, like,
four penis parasites.

07:19.873 --> 07:21.609
That guy's fun.

07:21.709 --> 07:23.376
And he's also right there.

07:24.612 --> 07:25.913
Carly!

07:26.714 --> 07:28.482
Oh, fun.

07:28.582 --> 07:29.950
* *

07:31.752 --> 07:34.121
Ooh, this place is amazing!

07:34.221 --> 07:36.724
Is that a bidet in the bathroom?

07:36.824 --> 07:39.292
I'm gonna go check.

07:40.661 --> 07:42.930
You, uh,
seem surprised to see me.

07:43.030 --> 07:44.264
Didn't you know
I was presenting you

07:44.364 --> 07:45.766
with your
lifetime achievement award?

07:45.866 --> 07:47.400
No.

07:47.501 --> 07:49.236
No, I did not.

07:49.336 --> 07:51.138
I guess they thought
we make a good pair.

07:51.238 --> 07:54.608
You know, probably since we've
always made such a good pair.

07:54.708 --> 07:56.844
Uh, congratulations, by the way.

07:56.944 --> 07:59.847
Webicon Web Icon is
a huge deal.

07:59.947 --> 08:01.882
I guess if we'd started
a channel together,

08:01.982 --> 08:03.951
I would've just
been holding you back.

08:04.051 --> 08:06.053
Or riding my coattails.

08:06.153 --> 08:08.321
Sounds like a fun ride.

08:09.122 --> 08:11.258
How'd you get this place,
anyway?

08:11.358 --> 08:15.128
Uh, probably by being
the most famous person here.

08:15.929 --> 08:17.731
I don't know,
maybe a different reason.

08:18.699 --> 08:22.402
Hey, did you get one
of the tarps? Those seem cool.

08:22.502 --> 08:23.904
Oh, yeah.

08:24.004 --> 08:25.438
They're awesome.

08:25.539 --> 08:27.741
We're really just making
the most of our time.

08:27.841 --> 08:29.677
The laughs we've had,

08:29.777 --> 08:31.244
you wouldn't believe.

08:31.344 --> 08:33.246
Same. You know,
I was gonna bounce,

08:33.346 --> 08:36.884
but then I figured: why not
make lemonade out of lemons?

08:36.984 --> 08:39.286
-[door opens]
-Exactly.

08:40.120 --> 08:42.690
It's a bidet, all right.

08:42.790 --> 08:44.625
Hell of a bidet.

08:44.725 --> 08:48.829
So you just have all this space
for you and your girlfriend?

08:48.929 --> 08:50.964
We, uh, broke up, actually.

08:51.064 --> 08:52.532
-Oh.
-And we didn't know?

08:52.633 --> 08:56.336
Don't you usually prefer
to dump people on a livestream?

08:56.436 --> 08:59.206
Let me make it up to you.
Why don't you all stay here?

09:00.373 --> 09:01.274
I don't know.

09:01.374 --> 09:03.110
I just started seeing someone.

09:03.210 --> 09:04.645
He's an auto mechanic.

09:04.745 --> 09:06.346
Like, a real manly man.

09:06.446 --> 09:08.849
He's probably off building us
a better tree house right now.

09:08.949 --> 09:10.317
So no.

09:11.551 --> 09:13.987
You listen to me, Carly Shay.
I am a knight in shining armor,

09:14.087 --> 09:16.089
and Dutch is
my damsel in distress,

09:16.189 --> 09:18.525
professionally speaking!

09:18.626 --> 09:19.492
So yes.

09:19.593 --> 09:21.061
Please.

09:21.161 --> 09:23.096
[sighs]
Fine.

09:23.196 --> 09:25.365
I'll stay
in this gorgeous tree house

09:25.465 --> 09:28.736
with the softest towels
I've ever felt.

09:28.836 --> 09:30.237
But you owe me.

09:35.909 --> 09:37.611
Millicent, this is perfect.
Beau is the investor

09:37.711 --> 09:38.846
of Freddie's dreams.

09:38.946 --> 09:40.814
Positive attitude.
Money to burn.

09:40.914 --> 09:44.718
No understanding of business
or perhaps even money at all.

09:45.686 --> 09:48.355
But my dad's confidence is
at an all-time low.

09:48.455 --> 09:50.658
He's not gonna try and make
a sale now.

09:50.758 --> 09:52.660
Which is why we need Beau
to come to him.

09:52.760 --> 09:54.061
He'll see it as a sign.

09:54.161 --> 09:56.964
Yes! I haven't done
a good scheme in ages.

09:57.064 --> 09:59.032
I hope I'm not rusty.

09:59.132 --> 10:01.001
* *

10:01.101 --> 10:03.804
How cool is it of Beau
to let us use his tree house?

10:03.904 --> 10:05.472
Yeah. Very cool.

10:05.572 --> 10:07.474
Except I am a little worried

10:07.574 --> 10:09.509
it's not built
to hold eight people.

10:09.609 --> 10:10.911
Sure it is.

10:11.011 --> 10:12.846
They wouldn't have included
a blackjack table

10:12.946 --> 10:15.282
if they didn't want you
to entertain.

10:15.949 --> 10:18.318
Since we're good on shelter
and food and water now,

10:18.418 --> 10:19.720
what should we do?

10:19.820 --> 10:22.289
[chanting]:
Flower crowns. Flower crowns.

10:22.389 --> 10:27.795
Yes! And then I heard
about an amazing sunset hike.

10:27.895 --> 10:31.131
Oh, uh, before we go spraining
our ankles all willy-nilly...

10:31.231 --> 10:32.766
I need to make sure
there's actually enough food

10:32.866 --> 10:34.567
and clean water
in this tree house for everyone.

10:34.668 --> 10:35.836
There's tons of food.

10:35.936 --> 10:37.604
I don't know
how much water there is--

10:37.705 --> 10:39.106
the fridge just does filtered.

10:40.073 --> 10:41.675
It even does pellet ice.

10:41.775 --> 10:43.911
Carly loves pellet ice.

10:47.080 --> 10:50.383
Beau, uh, actually,
can you grab us some drinks?

10:50.483 --> 10:52.953
Regular Coke with lime and--

10:53.053 --> 10:55.856
let me guess-- tepid water since
the body absorbs it faster.

10:55.956 --> 10:57.691
Oh. Yeah,
I know you're mocking me,

10:57.791 --> 10:59.459
but that's actually true,
so thanks.

10:59.559 --> 11:01.661
[Carly giggles]

11:01.762 --> 11:05.132
So, this I was not prepared for.

11:05.232 --> 11:06.867
Yeah, it's weird.

11:06.967 --> 11:09.069
But there's
absolutely nothing going on

11:09.169 --> 11:10.738
between Beau and me now.

11:10.838 --> 11:13.073
I doubt we have anything
in common anymore.

11:13.173 --> 11:16.643
Did somebody say "flower crown"?

11:18.178 --> 11:19.646
* *

11:19.747 --> 11:21.148
Which is why, with Kevin,

11:21.248 --> 11:23.183
you're not taking care
of the puppy...

11:23.283 --> 11:25.385
The puppy is taking care...

11:25.485 --> 11:27.254
-of you!
-Of you!

11:28.321 --> 11:31.091
Yeah, but don't tell Freddie
we told you, okay?

11:31.191 --> 11:32.692
He's got so many investors.

11:32.793 --> 11:35.328
He'd kill us if he knew we told
one more person about it.

11:35.428 --> 11:36.864
It's such a good idea.

11:36.964 --> 11:39.499
You think maybe I could get him
to pitch it to me?

11:40.400 --> 11:42.602
-Maybe.
-Maybe.

11:42.702 --> 11:46.073
Hey, um, what are the symptoms
of Lyme disease?

11:46.173 --> 11:48.876
This place has
a real Lyme-y vibe.

11:48.976 --> 11:51.745
You know what doesn't have
a Lyme-y vibe? Your app Kevin.

11:51.845 --> 11:54.848
Whoops. I didn't mean
to mention it in front of Beau.

11:54.948 --> 11:56.283
But now that
the puppy's out of the bag,

11:56.383 --> 11:57.617
why don't you tell him
about it.

11:57.717 --> 11:59.853
[sighs]
Okay, um, well, the idea was:

11:59.953 --> 12:02.122
match people
who need therapy dogs

12:02.222 --> 12:04.557
with people
who need dog-sitters, so that...

12:04.657 --> 12:05.959
It sounds awesome.

12:06.059 --> 12:08.395
How about you give me
the full pitch tomorrow.

12:08.495 --> 12:09.729
I need to text my dad first.

12:09.830 --> 12:11.731
My dad's my business guy.

12:11.832 --> 12:13.600
Also, I just love him.

12:13.700 --> 12:17.304
Really? Beau, I mean...
that would be great.

12:17.404 --> 12:18.638
Men supporting men.

12:18.738 --> 12:20.941
That's what it's all about.

12:24.011 --> 12:25.278
Oh, my God!

12:25.378 --> 12:27.447
Did you see me
just manifest that opportunity

12:27.547 --> 12:29.316
out of total thin air?

12:29.416 --> 12:31.584
-Oh, yes.
-You did that.

12:31.684 --> 12:33.053
-You did that!
-Yes!

12:33.153 --> 12:34.154
Ooh!

12:34.254 --> 12:35.688
* *

12:35.789 --> 12:37.524
Okay, you were right, Wes--

12:37.624 --> 12:39.526
that nontoxic bug spray
is useless.

12:39.626 --> 12:42.629
Mm-hmm.
Or maybe you're just too sweet.

12:43.430 --> 12:45.065
Here, this is safe

12:45.165 --> 12:46.867
and totally works.

12:46.967 --> 12:51.471
Wow, I'm just, like,
the hero of this entire weekend.

12:52.372 --> 12:54.207
-You know what would make it
even better? -[HARPER]: Nothing.

12:54.307 --> 12:56.509
Nothing could make this better,
because it's great!

12:56.609 --> 12:58.345
Right, Dutch?

12:58.445 --> 12:59.412
No.

12:59.512 --> 13:01.982
A chipmunk looked at me weird.

13:02.082 --> 13:03.984
I was gonna say scary stories.

13:04.084 --> 13:06.153
Oh, like the one about the guy
stranded in the forest

13:06.253 --> 13:08.388
with his girlfriend's
ex-boyfriend.

13:08.488 --> 13:10.790
Ooh, what's that one?

13:11.391 --> 13:13.293
Yup, no, I got it.

13:13.393 --> 13:17.364
Are we talking scary scary,
or "George the Bra" scary?

13:17.464 --> 13:18.866
[laughs]
Oh!

13:18.966 --> 13:21.268
[like George]:
"I'm going to get you."

13:21.368 --> 13:22.735
-[laughter]
-Uh...

13:22.836 --> 13:24.037
George the Bra?

13:24.137 --> 13:26.339
George the Bra
that tells ghost stories.

13:26.439 --> 13:28.575
It's a classic iCarly character.

13:28.675 --> 13:30.577
Carly,
your marshmallow's on fire.

13:30.677 --> 13:32.612
Oh.
[exhales sharply]

13:32.712 --> 13:34.614
We like 'em burnt and crispy.

13:34.714 --> 13:36.616
Then when you put it
on the chocolate...

13:36.716 --> 13:39.452
-it melts faster.
-It melts faster.

13:40.553 --> 13:43.290
I wasn't talking about
the viscosity of your dessert.

13:43.390 --> 13:45.893
I was talking about the
increased risk of forest fire.

13:45.993 --> 13:50.130
Wow. You can even take the fun
out of roasting marshmallows.

13:50.230 --> 13:52.432
Am I the only one here
whose definition of fun

13:52.532 --> 13:54.134
includes not dying?

13:54.234 --> 13:59.539
Oh, man, wait. I bet you wind up
dying in some super boring way.

13:59.639 --> 14:02.775
Or maybe I never die, because
I make careful decisions.

14:02.876 --> 14:04.544
Okay, let's all relax.

14:04.644 --> 14:06.947
Oh, I think Beau here is
plenty relaxed.

14:07.047 --> 14:10.550
Aah! Is this what we've
been making s'mores out of?

14:10.650 --> 14:11.851
This is my dress!

14:11.952 --> 14:13.453
This is cannibalism!

14:13.553 --> 14:16.489
Dutch, if we didn't eat it,
it was gonna attract bugs.

14:16.589 --> 14:18.691
Then Wes
would make us eat those.

14:18.791 --> 14:20.961
You know what?
I'm gonna go. I'll be back.

14:21.061 --> 14:24.231
Oh, actually, I was gonna storm
off super dramatically, so...

14:26.366 --> 14:28.801
Aah! Aah!

14:28.902 --> 14:31.838
[continues screaming]

14:33.006 --> 14:35.375
[DUTCH]:
Okay, you're good.

14:35.475 --> 14:37.477
-Wes, wait.
-Look, I'm sorry,

14:37.577 --> 14:38.912
but I just need a minute, okay?

14:39.012 --> 14:40.580
Let's all just cool off
and take some space.

14:40.680 --> 14:42.149
[thunder crashing]

14:42.249 --> 14:44.051
And pack ourselves
into a shelter

14:44.151 --> 14:45.552
that comfortably sleeps two.

14:45.652 --> 14:47.387
* *

14:47.487 --> 14:49.556
[thunder crashing]

14:49.656 --> 14:50.890
[loud crackling]

14:50.991 --> 14:52.859
Do you think that's FEMA
here to save us...

14:52.960 --> 14:55.828
or a serial killer
here to end us?

14:55.929 --> 14:57.330
-It was probably just a branch.
-Serial killer.

14:57.430 --> 14:59.399
-Dude.
-What?

14:59.499 --> 15:01.368
Carly, uh, can we talk?

15:01.468 --> 15:03.070
Uh, yeah.

15:03.170 --> 15:05.672
We should.

15:05.772 --> 15:07.040
[wind whistling]

15:10.677 --> 15:12.779
I'm sorry, Carly, but I'm
getting pretty frustrated, okay?

15:12.879 --> 15:14.281
I-I mean,
I've been working all weekend

15:14.381 --> 15:16.483
to try and keep us safe,
and it's, like, none of that

15:16.583 --> 15:19.319
matters to you because I
didn't weave you a flower crown.

15:19.419 --> 15:21.554
You don't weave a flower crown.
You tie it off.

15:21.654 --> 15:23.190
[sighs]
I'm just trying

15:23.290 --> 15:24.958
to make the best
of a bad situation,

15:25.058 --> 15:26.693
and you keep reminding me
how bad it is.

15:26.793 --> 15:29.896
Yeah, because it is bad, okay?
Not everything is skinny-dipping

15:29.997 --> 15:31.864
and lifetime achievement awards.

15:31.965 --> 15:33.566
Well, not everything is
life-or-death.

15:33.666 --> 15:36.069
[thunder crashing,
loud crackling]

15:38.571 --> 15:40.240
[screaming]

15:40.340 --> 15:41.574
Hi there.

15:41.674 --> 15:43.210
Oh, crap, wrong arms.

15:44.577 --> 15:47.314
Oh, uh, I-I was just reaching
for my phone.

15:47.414 --> 15:49.716
-It's very precious to me.
-I... I was...

15:49.816 --> 15:51.484
-I was also doing, like,
the same. -Yeah, same.

15:51.584 --> 15:54.787
-[thunder crashing]
-[screaming, grunting]

15:59.859 --> 16:02.996
I am my mother's son!

16:03.096 --> 16:05.332
-[thunder crashing]
-[screaming]

16:09.002 --> 16:11.304
See? You grabbed Beau, too.

16:11.404 --> 16:12.872
He's just very grab-able.

16:12.972 --> 16:15.208
-Whoa! Whoa!
-[screams]

16:19.612 --> 16:21.181
Well...

16:21.281 --> 16:23.283
-at least we still have a roof
over our heads. -[wood creaking]

16:27.087 --> 16:31.224
This album is
literally rocking my world.

16:31.324 --> 16:32.859
* *

16:38.031 --> 16:39.699
Well, we look amazing.

16:39.799 --> 16:42.435
I wasn't gonna let these outfits
go to waste.

16:42.535 --> 16:44.504
My best friend was getting
an award.

16:44.604 --> 16:47.407
I rented enough runway
to land a plane.

16:47.507 --> 16:49.242
Aw. That's sweet.

16:49.342 --> 16:51.211
You liar.

16:51.311 --> 16:52.445
You packed
all these cute clothes

16:52.545 --> 16:53.846
so you could look good
for Dutch.

16:53.946 --> 16:54.981
You like her.

16:55.082 --> 16:56.349
How dare you...

16:56.449 --> 16:58.885
read me so accurately.

16:58.985 --> 17:01.088
Okay, yeah,
when the tree house was falling,

17:01.188 --> 17:03.356
I reached for Dutch.

17:03.456 --> 17:05.392
But you reached for Beau.

17:05.492 --> 17:07.294
How dare you...

17:07.394 --> 17:09.762
recount true events.

17:09.862 --> 17:11.398
Do you still have feelings
for him?

17:11.498 --> 17:13.300
EscÃ¡ndalo.

17:15.635 --> 17:17.604
A week ago
I would've told you no,

17:17.704 --> 17:21.508
but Wes and I haven't been
on the same page all weekend.

17:21.608 --> 17:23.243
-Mm.
-It's like this whole experience

17:23.343 --> 17:26.446
has just made me realize that
he and I are really different.

17:26.546 --> 17:28.448
And sometimes
very different people

17:28.548 --> 17:31.050
-make great couples.
-Yeah, but...

17:31.151 --> 17:32.352
then there's Beau.

17:32.452 --> 17:34.621
I mean,
he makes everything so easy.

17:34.721 --> 17:35.755
Mm.

17:35.855 --> 17:36.789
When we broke up,
that was, like,

17:36.889 --> 17:38.291
the third fight we've ever had.

17:38.391 --> 17:39.792
Well, I guess the question is,

17:39.892 --> 17:41.928
do you want someone
who's like you,

17:42.028 --> 17:43.696
or do you want someone
who complements you?

17:43.796 --> 17:46.699
And I guess
the second question is,

17:46.799 --> 17:49.436
are you willing to risk
your dream career

17:49.536 --> 17:50.837
for your dream girl?

17:50.937 --> 17:52.272
Mm.

17:52.372 --> 17:53.806
You know what I wish?

17:53.906 --> 17:55.342
That we jumped
into each other's arms.

17:55.442 --> 17:56.876
'Cause then
it would've been like,

17:56.976 --> 17:59.078
"Aw, they're so cute.
They're best friends."

17:59.179 --> 18:01.281
[laughs]
So cute!

18:01.381 --> 18:03.583
But we didn't.

18:04.784 --> 18:06.686
So it was
the one failed start-up.

18:06.786 --> 18:08.921
It was the two failed marriages.

18:09.956 --> 18:12.192
He's tanking.

18:12.292 --> 18:13.826
[loud, awkward giggling]

18:13.926 --> 18:18.865
Spencer,
you know what you have to do.

18:18.965 --> 18:20.767
Damn it.

18:20.867 --> 18:24.371
And, I mean,
you learn by failing, right?

18:25.172 --> 18:26.806
-What is happening?
-H-Hi!

18:26.906 --> 18:29.476
My name is Bandit,
and I'm a terrier.

18:29.576 --> 18:32.179
[Irish accent]:
An Irish terrier.

18:32.279 --> 18:35.548
And I was ne-u-tered!

18:35.648 --> 18:37.184
Not because I wanted to be,

18:37.284 --> 18:39.752
but because it's the socially
responsible thing to do.

18:39.852 --> 18:42.054
Now, who wants
to scratch me belly?!

18:42.155 --> 18:44.424
-No one!
-Me!

18:44.524 --> 18:47.427
[rhythmic grunting]

18:48.961 --> 18:52.165
Wow. I mean, that was
the best pitch I've ever heard.

18:52.765 --> 18:54.534
I'm so bummed I can't invest.

18:54.634 --> 18:55.868
[SPENCER]:
What?

18:55.968 --> 18:59.071
[Irish accent]:
But I was ne-u-tered.

19:00.607 --> 19:03.810
Yeah, my dad thinks dogs
are just a fad. But...

19:03.910 --> 19:05.178
hey, good luck.

19:05.278 --> 19:06.979
Not that you'll need it.

19:07.079 --> 19:08.615
Spencer and Millicent told me
how many investors

19:08.715 --> 19:09.849
you have lined up.

19:09.949 --> 19:11.150
Congratulations.

19:11.251 --> 19:13.019
Huh.

19:14.987 --> 19:16.923
So you set this up.

19:17.023 --> 19:19.859
What, just so I could squeeze in
one last failure before

19:19.959 --> 19:21.994
-I give up entirely, or...?
-You can't give up.

19:22.094 --> 19:24.197
You have every reason
to believe in this.

19:24.297 --> 19:25.932
You're talented.
It's a great idea.

19:26.032 --> 19:27.667
The world needs it.

19:28.401 --> 19:30.036
In fact...

19:30.136 --> 19:31.738
It's only $13.

19:31.838 --> 19:33.440
It's all I have liquid.

19:33.540 --> 19:34.841
I'm in.

19:36.409 --> 19:38.411
Wow. [chuckles] Thank you.

19:38.511 --> 19:41.814
This means more to me than
any big investment ever could.

19:41.914 --> 19:43.616
Well, I want to make
a big investment.

19:43.716 --> 19:45.852
Okay, thunder stealer.

19:45.952 --> 19:47.454
* *

19:48.255 --> 19:49.556
Dutch?

19:49.656 --> 19:51.258
Are you in there?

19:51.358 --> 19:53.059
[DUTCH]:
No.

19:54.261 --> 19:56.563
All right.
Well, if you see Dutch,

19:56.663 --> 19:58.965
tell her that tarp
is not her color.

19:59.966 --> 20:01.934
How dare you.

20:02.034 --> 20:04.371
I look gorgeous in this.

20:04.471 --> 20:05.538
You do.

20:05.638 --> 20:08.074
Look, I love working for you.

20:08.174 --> 20:11.878
And we click creatively,
and I really admire you.

20:11.978 --> 20:13.613
But I think that
some of those feelings

20:13.713 --> 20:16.249
might be crossing the line,
and...

20:16.349 --> 20:18.150
I think you feel it, too.

20:19.151 --> 20:20.820
Yeah, I do.

20:20.920 --> 20:24.156
Both of my hearts are beating
out of my chest.

20:24.257 --> 20:26.959
I have two hearts.

20:27.059 --> 20:30.530
But we work together,
and this is my dream job.

20:30.630 --> 20:32.131
You're my dream stylist,

20:32.231 --> 20:34.901
and it's really helping me
push myself creatively.

20:35.001 --> 20:36.903
I think we need
to put that first.

20:37.003 --> 20:38.137
Me, too.

20:39.138 --> 20:40.239
[laughs]
So we agree.

20:40.340 --> 20:41.774
We're just gonna close our eyes,

20:41.874 --> 20:44.711
turn off our feelings
for the sake of professionalism.

20:46.379 --> 20:48.448
I really love your boundaries.

20:48.548 --> 20:50.317
[trembles]:
Uh-huh.

20:50.417 --> 20:52.285
Okay.

20:52.385 --> 20:53.353
Erase.

20:53.453 --> 20:54.754
[chuckles nervously]

20:54.854 --> 20:56.923
Erase.

20:57.023 --> 20:58.991
Zip! They're gone. All right.

20:59.091 --> 20:59.992
[laughs]

21:00.092 --> 21:02.829
Well, I'm so glad that worked.

21:02.929 --> 21:04.030
[laughs]

21:11.404 --> 21:13.340
There you are.

21:13.440 --> 21:15.508
I've been looking everywhere
for you.

21:15.608 --> 21:17.844
First place I checked was
in Beau's arms.

21:17.944 --> 21:20.246
Next time we're
in a collapsing tree house,

21:20.347 --> 21:22.682
I promise I will jump on you.

21:24.083 --> 21:25.518
Wes, I'm sorry.

21:25.618 --> 21:29.188
And I really appreciate
everything you've done for us.

21:29.989 --> 21:31.658
Well, hopefully
you'll appreciate this, too.

21:31.758 --> 21:32.892
Come with me.

21:32.992 --> 21:34.627
* *

21:35.795 --> 21:38.030
[whooping, cheering]

21:39.466 --> 21:41.668
Oh, my God, what is all this?

21:41.768 --> 21:42.735
[WES]:
It's your stage,

21:42.835 --> 21:44.704
for you to accept your award.

21:44.804 --> 21:46.939
[clapping, whooping]

21:47.907 --> 21:50.042
I don't deserve all this.

21:50.142 --> 21:52.845
-Carly...
-We are gathered here today

21:52.945 --> 21:56.248
to celebrate the life
of Carly Shay.

21:57.517 --> 21:58.785
[WES]:
Actually, as the person

21:58.885 --> 22:00.353
who made the podium
and the award, I...

22:00.453 --> 22:02.489
Pretty sure this is the award.

22:02.589 --> 22:04.090
I had it flown in this morning.

22:04.190 --> 22:07.093
Does that mean
you could have had us flown out?

22:08.294 --> 22:09.629
I wanted to stay,

22:09.729 --> 22:11.664
'cause I have something
to tell you, Carly.

22:11.764 --> 22:14.100
Uh, this feels like it's in the
arena of what I wanted to say,

22:14.200 --> 22:16.002
so if I could just go first,
I'll be real quick.

22:16.102 --> 22:18.438
-I think we should go
in alphabetical order. -Eh...

22:18.538 --> 22:20.006
-I love you.
-I love you.

22:21.441 --> 22:23.342
Duly noted.

22:23.443 --> 22:25.277
Carly, breaking up with you was

22:25.378 --> 22:27.113
the second biggest
mistake of my life.

22:27.213 --> 22:29.749
Do you remember when I bought
that pizza with Bitcoin?

22:29.849 --> 22:32.284
Okay, I would never make
either of those mistakes,

22:32.385 --> 22:35.922
because I love you, and I
actually do still use checks.

22:36.756 --> 22:38.425
These are all great points.
Very compelling.

22:38.525 --> 22:39.626
A lot of pros, lot of cons.

22:39.726 --> 22:41.594
Okay, so what are you gonna do?

22:41.694 --> 22:43.229
Wait to see if she says it back.

22:43.329 --> 22:45.131
Not you, dude. Carly.

22:50.537 --> 22:52.204
I'd like to thank God

22:52.304 --> 22:53.606
and my brother Spencer

22:53.706 --> 22:56.175
and my manicurist Leslie.

22:56.275 --> 22:57.209
I love you.

22:57.309 --> 22:58.578
Leslie.

23:01.013 --> 23:01.748
And...

23:01.848 --> 23:04.283
[helicopter approaching]

23:05.852 --> 23:08.521
-Hey! Hey!
-Down here!

23:08.621 --> 23:10.222
We're here!

23:10.322 --> 23:11.390
See?

23:11.491 --> 23:13.960
That's why I thank God first.

23:17.063 --> 23:20.066
I looked death
straight in the eyes and said,

23:20.166 --> 23:24.236
"Not today, Carly. Not today."

23:24.336 --> 23:27.039
I drank from a bidet.

23:29.075 --> 23:31.578
What happens at Webicon
stays at Webicon.

23:31.678 --> 23:35.014
So we left those feelings
at Webicon.

23:35.114 --> 23:37.917
Why? Did she say something
about me?

23:38.017 --> 23:40.753
Yeah, I feel good
about where I landed.

23:40.853 --> 23:43.656
I mean, the heart wants
what the heart wants.

23:43.756 --> 23:45.291
Until it doesn't.

23:45.391 --> 23:46.659
And then does again.

23:46.759 --> 23:48.661
And sometimes you get rescued

23:48.761 --> 23:50.329
before you even have to make
a decision,

23:50.429 --> 23:52.231
and then you end up
on a helicopter

23:52.331 --> 23:55.101
with two guys just staring
at you the whole time.

23:57.203 --> 23:59.872
But yeah, everything's great.

24:01.674 --> 24:03.910
I got a penis parasite.
