00:19.960 --> 00:21.200
Hey...

00:23.040 --> 00:25.920
What are you making?
- Chocolate cake. I am gonna taste it.

00:26.000 --> 00:28.240
Nooo...

00:28.760 --> 00:30.280
It's nice.
- No.

00:31.240 --> 00:32.840
Stop it.
- Okay.

00:33.000 --> 00:34.080
Okay.

00:34.160 --> 00:36.040
Where's Princess?
- Sleeping.

01:03.400 --> 01:05.000
Kabir! Kabir!

01:07.440 --> 01:08.680
What happened?

01:08.760 --> 01:11.920
Is it done?
- Short circuit. Huh....

01:12.000 --> 01:15.120
I told you, let's order a cake from outside.
- No.

04:13.280 --> 04:15.160
Jai Hind(Salutations), sir.
- Jai Hind(Salutations).

04:20.280 --> 04:21.760
When were you last
in Baramati (a city)?

04:21.840 --> 04:23.760
I just got back yesterday.

04:23.840 --> 04:26.720
Actually... I was planning
on settling down there.

04:26.800 --> 04:29.440
But when I heard you're
getting posted in this branch, I....

04:35.720 --> 04:37.280
Here... for this pickle.

04:37.360 --> 04:38.600
There's no need for this, sir.

04:38.680 --> 04:41.680
Keep it!
- You're embarrassing me, sir.

04:43.000 --> 04:44.200
Take it, Malwankar...

04:44.680 --> 04:45.920
...otherwise it will
look like you're bribing me.

04:46.320 --> 04:47.760
Keep it.

04:50.840 --> 04:54.120
There were three charges against you.
- Sir.

04:54.320 --> 04:55.720
Get this, Malwankar.

04:56.760 --> 04:58.240
If you want to play by your rules...

04:58.320 --> 05:00.280
...you should pick
the people you want to play with.

05:01.040 --> 05:02.360
Because you are from my hometown...

05:03.160 --> 05:04.640
...both, I and our hometown...

05:05.440 --> 05:10.200
...will be judged by what you do.

05:14.920 --> 05:16.360
Go!
- Sir!

05:32.680 --> 05:34.240
Something's definitely out of place.

05:34.400 --> 05:37.720
The new boss seems a bit odd.

05:39.080 --> 05:41.080
He's a vegan and a teetotaler.

05:41.160 --> 05:42.640
I can't figure this
one out just yet...

05:43.000 --> 05:44.600
...but we must find
out what's going on.

05:44.680 --> 05:47.600
Speak softly, sir.

05:48.000 --> 05:49.840
These walls have ears.

05:49.920 --> 05:51.760
What the....

06:00.000 --> 06:02.720
You see... from today
I am going to be a good boy.

06:03.000 --> 06:04.040
What do you say?

06:04.120 --> 06:05.640
The monitor of the class.

06:06.120 --> 06:08.120
Behave yourself, huh?

06:08.960 --> 06:09.600
Or kneel down.

06:09.680 --> 06:11.000
Prakash, the CCTV from Rahul's....

06:11.880 --> 06:12.280
Sir.

06:13.760 --> 06:14.960
Sir....

06:15.880 --> 06:17.040
Sit.

06:32.640 --> 06:34.400
Sir, may I?
- Come in.

06:34.720 --> 06:36.880
Sir, why is Malwankar back here?
- Come in, Kabir.

06:37.000 --> 06:37.960
Sit.

06:51.880 --> 06:53.280
What's our job, Kabir?

07:00.960 --> 07:02.280
To enforce law and order.
- Exactly!

07:02.360 --> 07:05.360
But even with abundant resources,
we fail to do our job.

07:05.800 --> 07:07.920
To curb crime.

07:08.640 --> 07:09.800
Do you know why?

07:12.120 --> 07:14.880
Sir, bureaucratic hurdles.
- Bullshit!

07:15.040 --> 07:17.640
You see, Kabir, if you are
unable to clean up the garbage...

07:17.720 --> 07:19.600
...you should try
cleaning the mop first.

07:20.720 --> 07:22.240
My job here is not
to clear the garbage.

07:23.000 --> 07:24.240
I'm sure you guys
can do that very well.

07:26.280 --> 07:30.120
But... who's going
to keep you guys clean?

07:33.280 --> 07:35.120
Malwankar's just the start.

07:38.280 --> 07:40.000
Eventually,
I'll clean up this entire mess.

07:40.720 --> 07:42.360
Neat and clean.

07:47.360 --> 07:48.680
Kabir...

07:49.600 --> 07:52.600
The recovery in Malwankar's
case should've been 1.2 million.

07:53.080 --> 07:54.840
But you only deposited half of that.

07:55.360 --> 08:00.000
Deposit the rest soon... with
a detailed report.

08:01.120 --> 08:02.040
- Sir.

08:13.080 --> 08:14.880
Last night I took Josh...

08:15.000 --> 08:17.320
...one step closer
to a new lease on life.

08:19.800 --> 08:21.000
I'm sure you know that.

08:21.240 --> 08:22.640
And action.

08:22.720 --> 08:24.800
Hi, my name is Anita Sahani.

08:24.880 --> 08:27.720
I don't need to listen
to your nonsense!

08:32.000 --> 08:35.320
My mobile number is 986721...

08:35.400 --> 08:38.240
And I've got nothing
to prove to you, either!

08:38.320 --> 08:39.960
Understand?

08:42.920 --> 08:46.720
I have done theatre. I have
done serious plays as well as comedy.

08:46.800 --> 08:48.240
I can't take this anymore!

08:55.440 --> 08:58.280
I stand 5 feet 2 inches tall,
and these are my profiles.

09:00.960 --> 09:02.200
Works for you?

09:04.400 --> 09:07.160
"There's no way I can express
this love in mere words!

09:07.240 --> 09:09.000
The fire raging in this heart..."

09:09.160 --> 09:10.080
Bye, Priyanka.

09:10.200 --> 09:11.920
- All the best.
- Thank you.

09:12.000 --> 09:14.040
What does this dialogue mean, pal?

09:35.800 --> 09:36.440
Yeah, Dad.

09:36.640 --> 09:38.720
Why don't you guys come
down for a couple of weeks?

09:38.800 --> 09:40.320
Tina's gone out of town for a shoot.

09:40.400 --> 09:41.840
It doesn't work like that.

09:41.920 --> 09:44.160
You don't just directly land
a film opposite Shah Rukh Khan!

09:44.240 --> 09:45.640
These days,
there are so many opportunities.

09:45.720 --> 09:47.000
Web-series, daily soaps....

09:47.080 --> 09:48.160
I'm sure I'll get something.

09:48.240 --> 09:49.960
Tell Mom to call me in the evening.

09:50.040 --> 09:50.400
Okay.

09:50.600 --> 09:52.160
Okay, bye-bye.

09:58.320 --> 09:59.440
Thank you so much, sir.

09:59.640 --> 10:00.320
You're the man!

10:00.400 --> 10:02.280
See you... bye.
- Thank you so much, sir. Thank you.

10:02.360 --> 10:04.960
He's the next big thing.
Watch out for him.

10:05.080 --> 10:06.680
And trust me... you're Maya.

10:06.880 --> 10:07.360
That's it.

10:07.440 --> 10:09.920
Do you want me to prepare something?
- Just be yourself.

10:10.000 --> 10:11.200
Okay, just play it subtle.

10:11.800 --> 10:12.720
Tomorrow my office
will call you about...

10:12.800 --> 10:15.360
...the location and shoot timings.
- Okay. - Okay.

10:15.440 --> 10:17.000
Do you want me to bring something?

10:17.080 --> 10:18.840
It's your solo audition tomorrow.

10:18.920 --> 10:19.760
Just bring your best.

10:19.840 --> 10:20.760
Okay, take care.
- See you tomorrow.

10:20.840 --> 10:22.040
Bye.
- Bye.

10:22.200 --> 10:24.000
Don't party tonight.
- Yeah.

10:27.080 --> 10:27.960
Can't be done.

10:28.040 --> 10:29.920
I've no time or dates to spare, sir.

10:30.000 --> 10:30.640
Sir...

10:30.720 --> 10:31.960
Firoz, wait up.

10:32.040 --> 10:33.240
Yeah... I'll call you later.

10:33.320 --> 10:34.920
Yeah, done. Firoz.

10:36.120 --> 10:37.720
Hey, buddy.
- How are you?

10:38.000 --> 10:40.040
What about my casting?
- Leave that to me.

10:40.120 --> 10:42.200
I will get it done soon.

10:44.720 --> 10:46.200
Has anybody seen my phone?

10:47.560 --> 10:49.040
Has anybody taken my phone?

11:32.200 --> 11:33.360
Hi.

11:34.440 --> 11:35.680
Partho.

11:37.440 --> 11:40.400
Gavin sir sent me.
- Oh yeah...

11:41.440 --> 11:43.840
Sorry, I've never
seen you in the office.

11:43.920 --> 11:44.920
Actually, no one has.

11:45.000 --> 11:47.360
I've joined office
only three days ago.

11:47.440 --> 11:49.400
I'm also slightly nervous.

11:49.840 --> 11:52.400
Would you prefer rehearsing here, or...
- No.

11:52.600 --> 11:53.240
Please come in.

11:53.320 --> 11:56.200
Here's your copy, and this one's mine.

11:56.720 --> 11:59.680
Why don't you go through your lines?
- Okay.

12:12.880 --> 12:14.240
What happened?

12:15.400 --> 12:17.160
This story is quite relatable.

12:17.240 --> 12:21.000
In fact, it reads like it's my story.
- Mine too.

12:22.280 --> 12:24.920
Well, everyone comes
to Mumbai to become an actor.

12:25.000 --> 12:28.080
And eventually ends up becoming an
assistant director, or a producer or a director.

12:28.160 --> 12:30.320
So, even you came
here to become an actor?

12:30.400 --> 12:32.600
Yeah... long story.

12:33.840 --> 12:35.680
So... why don't you
check your lines...

12:35.760 --> 12:38.320
...and see if they are okay.
- Okay.

12:40.040 --> 12:43.760
"I came to Mumbai with the
dreams of becoming an actress."

12:44.360 --> 12:48.080
"I always believed that... that"...

12:48.280 --> 12:53.240
"...the amount of success one gets is equal
to the amount of hard work put in."

12:56.000 --> 12:57.200
Sorry....

12:57.640 --> 12:59.360
Can I improvise?

12:59.600 --> 13:01.120
I can't make that decision.

13:01.720 --> 13:04.120
You know what,
why don't you read those lines once...

13:04.200 --> 13:06.840
...and we'll record it on your phone.

13:06.920 --> 13:07.760
And after that,
we will send it to Gavin sir.

13:07.840 --> 13:10.080
Let's show it to
him and get his opinion.

13:10.280 --> 13:12.400
Shall we record?
- Okay....

13:12.600 --> 13:15.880
Anita, how about we rehearse
this once before we record it?

13:15.960 --> 13:18.440
One rehearsal to get into the flow.
- Okay.

13:18.640 --> 13:19.640
Ready.

13:19.720 --> 13:20.440
Should I look here and speak?

13:20.640 --> 13:21.360
Yes.

13:22.360 --> 13:23.840
Okay.

13:26.160 --> 13:28.960
"3 years ago, I came
here to become an actress."

13:30.800 --> 13:31.720
Sorry....

13:32.880 --> 13:34.040
Mumbai....
- Yeah.

13:34.120 --> 13:34.960
You can do it again.

13:35.040 --> 13:38.000
"When I came here, I believed"....

13:41.040 --> 13:41.960
"I believed"....

13:42.040 --> 13:43.440
Sorry... "talent"... yeah.
Okay.

13:49.360 --> 13:55.080
"3 years ago, I came to Mumbai
to become an actress then"....

13:57.120 --> 13:58.280
Sorry, I know it, I know it.

13:58.360 --> 14:00.240
You know what, Anita.

14:00.440 --> 14:01.760
Your expressions are perfect.

14:01.840 --> 14:04.600
I guess you're having trouble
memorizing the lines. - Yeah.

14:04.680 --> 14:08.360
Just give me a minute.
- I have an option for you.

14:08.680 --> 14:10.800
Shall we try that?
- Okay.

14:11.240 --> 14:13.600
I'll just have this dialogue
sheet over here behind the phone.

14:13.800 --> 14:15.080
You continue saying your lines.

14:15.160 --> 14:16.320
In case you forget your lines...

14:16.400 --> 14:20.000
...you can read from this. Yeah?
- Okay.

14:20.240 --> 14:24.000
Why don't you turn on the recorder?
- Nervous.

14:29.320 --> 14:33.080
"Hi, Mom... Hi, Dad."

14:37.240 --> 14:39.120
"I am completely conscious of..."

14:40.000 --> 14:41.960
"...what I'm going to say next..."

14:42.720 --> 14:45.000
"...and I'm really
sorry for doing this."

14:45.600 --> 14:47.680
"Dad, remember what you said to me..."

14:47.760 --> 14:49.720
"...when I was leaving for Mumbai?"

14:52.280 --> 14:56.640
"You said... baby, go
there and work very hard."

14:57.400 --> 15:01.280
"The harder you work,
the more successful you'll become."

15:01.760 --> 15:03.800
"I worked really hard."

15:05.840 --> 15:08.720
"From dawn to dusk..."

15:08.840 --> 15:11.160
"...I would audition all day."

15:13.240 --> 15:15.400
"And in spite of all my efforts..."

15:18.000 --> 15:20.320
"...I was never
selected for anything."

15:21.040 --> 15:23.320
"Luck is a very important
factor out here."

15:24.200 --> 15:25.760
"And I was completely out of it."

15:25.920 --> 15:28.160
"Some people say
those who aren't lucky..."

15:28.800 --> 15:30.880
"...have to compromise themselves."

15:33.840 --> 15:36.040
"But I gave you my word."

15:38.120 --> 15:41.000
"I would rather die than compromise."

15:43.200 --> 15:45.040
"And here I am today."

15:47.160 --> 15:51.760
"I lost, Dad... I lost, Mom..."

15:52.800 --> 15:57.080
"I really wanted to make
you guys very proud of me."

15:57.320 --> 15:58.920
"But I couldn't make it."

15:59.560 --> 16:01.080
"I am really sorry."

16:24.840 --> 16:26.080
This is perfect.

16:26.640 --> 16:27.760
Amazing.

16:28.680 --> 16:32.600
You... made me emotional.

16:34.320 --> 16:35.680
My throat's dried up.

16:36.000 --> 16:37.800
Can I have some water?
- I'm really sorry.

16:37.880 --> 16:39.920
I'll get you some water.
I'll get you some....

16:40.000 --> 16:41.360
Very nice.
- Thank you.

16:57.960 --> 16:59.960
Here.
- Thank you, that was very nice.

17:00.080 --> 17:01.240
Thank you.

17:03.680 --> 17:05.880
Anita, I've to make a phone call...

17:05.960 --> 17:07.320
...and there's no calling
balance in my phone.

17:08.120 --> 17:10.240
Can I make a call?
- Yes please, go ahead.

17:10.320 --> 17:11.760
Okay. Thank you.

17:14.400 --> 17:15.920
It's locked.

17:19.880 --> 17:20.960
Thanks.

17:23.360 --> 17:25.600
Hello. Can I speak to Gavin sir?

17:26.040 --> 17:27.000
Yeah....

17:27.120 --> 17:28.280
Yes, sir.

17:29.120 --> 17:32.000
We're done with the
screen test. Correct.

17:33.120 --> 17:34.200
Yes, sir.

17:34.280 --> 17:36.280
We'll wrap up the part soon.

17:36.640 --> 17:38.040
Okay, sir... no problem, sir.

17:38.400 --> 17:39.080
Okay sir.

17:39.160 --> 17:40.680
I'll send it over soon to you.

17:40.920 --> 17:42.160
Okay, bye.

17:45.040 --> 17:45.920
That was good.

17:46.000 --> 17:49.720
I told Gavin sir
that... you were amazing.

17:49.800 --> 17:51.200
We'll send him this video shortly.

17:51.600 --> 17:52.280
Thank you.

17:52.440 --> 17:55.080
He wanted to know if we got something
to eat to celebrate your terrific audition?

17:55.160 --> 17:57.640
But I said no... I'm not that lucky!

17:57.720 --> 17:59.040
I'm really sorry. I'm really sorry.

17:59.120 --> 18:00.960
I'll order something right away.
- No, it's alright.

18:01.040 --> 18:02.760
I'll order pizza.
- No... no, please....

18:02.840 --> 18:03.920
Are you sure?
- Yeah.

18:04.000 --> 18:05.000
Okay.

18:05.640 --> 18:07.320
Just give me some time.

18:08.360 --> 18:09.120
Hello.
- Hello.

18:09.200 --> 18:10.360
This is Pizza House.

18:10.600 --> 18:13.800
I am calling from K-403, Crystal Society.
- Yes ma'am.

18:13.880 --> 18:17.960
Could you send over two
medium farm house pizzas.

18:18.360 --> 18:21.960
Actually, send just one medium size pizza.
- Yes ma'am.

18:22.040 --> 18:24.960
And... don't take 40
minutes like the last time.

18:25.040 --> 18:27.280
Be here in 30 minutes.
- Okay ma'am. Okay ma'am.

18:27.800 --> 18:29.800
Okay. Thank you.

18:31.280 --> 18:33.320
Just 30 minutes.
- Yeah.

18:33.680 --> 18:35.320
So Gavin sir suggested that...

18:35.400 --> 18:37.160
...we should rehearse
the next scene as well.

18:37.680 --> 18:39.120
The suffocation scene.

18:39.360 --> 18:41.920
He just wants to see how
you express yourself in that scene.

18:42.000 --> 18:44.640
How... how are we going to do that?

18:44.720 --> 18:45.440
I'll show you.

18:45.640 --> 18:48.160
So according to the scene,
first, you switch on the video.

18:48.240 --> 18:51.760
When it's on,
take this tie-up first...

18:51.840 --> 18:56.240
...and fasten it around your
legs like this. And then tighten it.

18:56.880 --> 18:59.760
Next... you don't have glasses,
but I do so I will remove them.

18:59.840 --> 19:00.720
Let me show you.

19:00.960 --> 19:03.960
Take this... and wrap
it around really wide.

19:04.040 --> 19:06.240
Otherwise, it won't fit well.

19:06.640 --> 19:08.160
Wide....

19:10.360 --> 19:11.960
Wide....

19:14.320 --> 19:15.880
And....

19:19.000 --> 19:22.360
Then you take this and...

19:22.800 --> 19:26.360
...fasten your hands at the back.

19:27.240 --> 19:28.720
Really tight.

19:31.440 --> 19:34.440
And... you'll start suffocating.

19:42.320 --> 19:43.680
God.

19:51.720 --> 19:52.840
Oh, God!

19:58.920 --> 20:00.240
Wasn't that realistic?

20:01.800 --> 20:05.240
God, that was simply wow!
- You liked it?

20:05.320 --> 20:08.240
You should've been an actor.
- No one gave me a chance.

20:08.400 --> 20:09.920
But it's your turn now, okay?
- Yes. Yes....

20:10.000 --> 20:12.840
I'll clear this mess out
so it doesn't get in your way.

20:12.920 --> 20:15.720
And now you get ready for your shot.

20:15.800 --> 20:18.080
Listen... don't be late...

20:18.160 --> 20:21.160
...or else I'll really die!
- Don't worry. I won't let you die so soon.

20:21.240 --> 20:21.960
Huh?

20:22.040 --> 20:24.280
I mean... you've still
to pay for the pizza.

20:24.360 --> 20:25.760
Haha... Okay!

20:25.840 --> 20:27.440
Wait, can I have the phone, please?

20:27.800 --> 20:30.640
It's really dirty. Let me clean it.

20:30.720 --> 20:32.400
Here... now you can have it.
It's okay.

20:34.760 --> 20:36.800
Alright... don't be late.

20:51.040 --> 20:52.080
Mom.

20:52.640 --> 20:53.640
Dad.

20:54.680 --> 20:57.240
"Only I am to be held responsible
for what I'm about to do now..."

20:57.600 --> 20:58.960
"...no one else."

23:46.080 --> 23:48.080
I know those people were innocent.

23:49.080 --> 23:50.240
I feel really bad for them.

23:51.840 --> 23:53.280
Whenever I try to sleep at night...

23:54.040 --> 23:59.160
...their faces haunt me, and
I wake up scared, Mrs. Mascarenhas.

24:00.720 --> 24:03.080
But then I look at Josh's face...

24:08.040 --> 24:11.000
...I eventually fall asleep,
Mrs. Mascarenhas.

24:19.000 --> 24:20.320
I miss you.

24:26.160 --> 24:27.960
Sir, Shinde sir has sent this video.

24:29.000 --> 24:30.360
Yeah... the actress case....

24:30.760 --> 24:31.280
File it.

24:31.360 --> 24:34.040
There's only one
CCTV at this junction.

24:41.760 --> 24:43.080
Pause, pause, pause.

24:43.160 --> 24:44.360
Zoom.

24:45.840 --> 24:47.920
Sir, nothing's clear.
It was raining heavily.

24:48.000 --> 24:49.920
It's hard to make anything out.

24:50.040 --> 24:54.360
Rajwade... does glamour
make you a grow a horn?

24:55.000 --> 24:57.120
Let me get my share of glamour first.

24:57.720 --> 24:58.360
What's wrong?

24:58.440 --> 25:00.920
One aspiring actress who lived on Yari
Road commits suicide...

25:01.080 --> 25:02.720
...and the entire city's curious.

25:03.600 --> 25:04.720
Back in my hometown...

25:04.800 --> 25:06.120
...because of famine, farmers
are committing suicide every day.

25:06.200 --> 25:08.000
But no one gives a damn.

25:08.280 --> 25:09.440
Which actress?

25:13.400 --> 25:14.760
This is exactly what I am saying!

25:15.040 --> 25:16.360
Here I am talking about
the farmer's plight...

25:16.440 --> 25:17.600
...and you are more interested
in the actress.

25:17.880 --> 25:19.840
Go search on the Internet.

25:19.920 --> 25:21.320
Fine, I will.

25:21.640 --> 25:25.640
But first... have this pizza.

25:25.720 --> 25:26.920
With cheese crust.

25:27.000 --> 25:28.800
It's Ganpat's birthday today,
so it's his treat.

25:28.880 --> 25:30.600
I saved this one last slice for you.

25:30.840 --> 25:33.680
Otherwise, these gluttons would've
polished-off this last one as well.

25:33.760 --> 25:35.000
You did the right thing.
- Yeah.

25:35.080 --> 25:37.040
But you know what...
- What?

25:38.000 --> 25:39.920
These days,
there's no point of a good deed.

25:40.000 --> 25:41.600
Do you know why people
have stopped helping others?

25:41.680 --> 25:42.120
- Why?

25:42.200 --> 25:43.960
It's a bloody tedious process.

25:44.040 --> 25:46.040
This girl donated six of her organs.

25:46.120 --> 25:47.960
How many?
- Six.

25:48.040 --> 25:49.080
But it took them two hours...

25:49.160 --> 25:51.000
...to get a simple NOC
from the police station.

25:51.440 --> 25:53.600
So... who will be motivated
to do a good deed?

25:56.000 --> 25:57.720
Here... play it.

25:59.080 --> 26:01.440
This is the CCTV at
Nana Chowk (Crossroads)...

26:01.640 --> 26:03.160
...while this road leads
to Chowpatty.

26:03.240 --> 26:05.720
Kabir sir, don't misunderstand me...

26:06.880 --> 26:08.080
But please stop drinking so much.

26:08.280 --> 26:10.800
I pay for my own drink.
- Sometimes.

26:11.320 --> 26:12.720
But that's not the point.

26:13.000 --> 26:14.800
You see... Rahul donated his organs.

26:14.880 --> 26:15.960
Even this actress donated her organs.

26:16.040 --> 26:17.440
This gave me an idea, that...

26:17.640 --> 26:20.000
...we should donate
our organs as well.

26:21.600 --> 26:25.880
But sir... if we keep
drinking like this...

26:26.280 --> 26:29.240
Then our organs will become hollow and
play like mouth organs and be of no use.

26:31.440 --> 26:32.600
Need something else?

26:35.080 --> 26:36.240
Hey, start it.

26:37.800 --> 26:40.640
See Kabir sir,
this girl recorded her suicide.

26:41.800 --> 26:42.920
Sir! It's weird. Right?

26:43.680 --> 26:44.600
"Hi Dad."

26:44.680 --> 26:46.040
Dump everything on a hard
drive and send it to my cabin.

26:46.120 --> 26:48.040
"I am completely conscious of..."

26:48.120 --> 26:50.280
"...what I'm going to say next"

26:50.600 --> 26:52.640
"and I'm really sorry for this."

26:56.720 --> 26:58.840
"Dad, remember what you said to me..."

26:58.920 --> 27:00.920
"When... I was leaving for Mumbai?"

27:05.840 --> 27:09.040
"You said... Baby, go
there and work very hard."

27:09.120 --> 27:12.640
"The harder you work,
the more successful you'll become."

27:15.000 --> 27:16.200
Try harder, my He-Man.

27:16.280 --> 27:17.800
Hot - hot Omelet.

27:17.880 --> 27:19.400
Healthy - healthy breakfast.

27:19.600 --> 27:22.080
For my boys.
- Thank you, Granny. Say thank you.

27:22.400 --> 27:25.440
Granny... I don't want an omelet.

27:25.640 --> 27:27.320
I want a peanut butter sandwich.

27:27.400 --> 27:29.240
It's healthy, good for you.

27:29.320 --> 27:30.800
Packed with proteins. Eat it.

27:30.880 --> 27:32.360
I am bored of eating omelets.

27:32.440 --> 27:33.920
Eat quietly.

27:37.000 --> 27:38.000
Oh my God.

27:38.120 --> 27:39.280
What happened?

27:40.080 --> 27:41.200
That Anita Sahani....

27:41.280 --> 27:43.120
The actress who committed suicide.

27:43.240 --> 27:45.360
Now most of the producers
and directors are saying...

27:45.440 --> 27:46.880
...that they would've
given her a role.

27:47.080 --> 27:48.800
The current generation, I tell you....

27:48.960 --> 27:50.120
A little bit of frustration
is all it takes...

27:50.200 --> 27:51.600
...to drive them to
committing suicide.

27:52.160 --> 27:54.600
They don't think about
their parents at all.

27:55.840 --> 27:56.920
When someone dies...

27:57.000 --> 27:59.360
...countless other lives
get destroyed with them.

27:59.920 --> 28:03.640
I wish this generation
wasn't so selfish.

28:03.720 --> 28:06.200
Mom... whatever happens...

28:07.000 --> 28:08.680
...there's a very good reason for it.

28:11.800 --> 28:15.040
Hey... Josh. Peanut butter sandwich.

28:17.400 --> 28:19.760
It's okay. He's a kid, let him enjoy.

28:33.440 --> 28:35.960
The pizza delivery
guy rushed her to the hospital.

28:36.600 --> 28:38.000
She lived alone.

28:38.240 --> 28:39.360
Alone....

28:39.440 --> 28:40.320
Depressed....

28:40.560 --> 28:42.080
And she committed suicide.

28:47.840 --> 28:51.400
Why would she order pizza?
- Could be her dying wish.

28:52.360 --> 28:53.360
Eating pizza?

28:53.720 --> 28:54.920
Possible.

28:55.840 --> 28:56.800
Play the first clip.

29:03.200 --> 29:04.720
"Hi, Mom..."

29:04.920 --> 29:06.080
"Remember you said..."

29:06.200 --> 29:08.600
"...baby,
go there and work very hard."

29:08.960 --> 29:12.920
"The harder you work,
the more successful you'll become."

29:16.440 --> 29:17.760
"I came to Mumbai."

29:18.000 --> 29:19.040
Rewind.

29:20.160 --> 29:21.200
There.

29:21.280 --> 29:21.760
Now play....

29:21.840 --> 29:24.440
"The harder you work,
the more successful you'll become."

29:26.120 --> 29:29.360
"From dawn to dusk..."

29:29.440 --> 29:31.880
"...I would audition all day."

29:32.160 --> 29:34.160
"And in spite of all my efforts..."

29:37.000 --> 29:39.040
"...I was never selected for anything."
- She isn't just saying it, she's reading it out!

29:40.320 --> 29:41.400
So?

29:41.720 --> 29:43.080
Suicide notes are always written.

29:44.160 --> 29:46.920
Well, one can speak it out, too.

29:47.000 --> 29:48.360
Sure. But they aren't written
first and then read out.

29:52.680 --> 29:53.680
But....

29:53.760 --> 29:55.840
"Luck is very important here."

29:56.000 --> 29:58.000
"So it was a new factor."

29:58.360 --> 30:00.840
"Some people say
those who aren't lucky...."

30:01.120 --> 30:02.280
See....

30:07.720 --> 30:09.840
That's right, sir. She is reading it.

30:15.000 --> 30:17.040
"The future holds many
joyful experiences for you."

30:17.120 --> 30:21.000
"You'll be blessed with love,
fortune, work, good health."

30:21.080 --> 30:23.440
"There are signs of
a foreign trip as well."

30:23.640 --> 30:26.120
"Please deposit 20 rupees. Thank you."

30:29.640 --> 30:30.880
Thank you.

30:31.200 --> 30:32.760
Keep the change.

30:33.680 --> 30:34.680
Seriously?

30:34.760 --> 30:36.280
You believe in all that bullshit?

30:37.000 --> 30:38.920
It's like watching a film, Danny.

30:39.720 --> 30:40.840
It's a lie....

30:41.000 --> 30:43.840
Actually, you know it's not even real,
but it's fun.

30:45.160 --> 30:47.000
You're not telling me
what you called me here for.

30:50.840 --> 30:53.920
The Australian Centre for
Medical Science sent me an email.

30:54.200 --> 30:57.360
They are offering
a 3-year contract, and...

30:57.440 --> 30:59.000
...it's a great package.

30:59.640 --> 31:00.880
And....

31:01.920 --> 31:03.000
And?

31:05.000 --> 31:06.280
And nothing.

31:06.720 --> 31:10.000
It's just that... everything is
going the way I always wanted it to.

31:10.680 --> 31:12.360
It's unbelievable.

31:13.200 --> 31:15.000
Four months ago when
Josh suffered a major attack...

31:15.080 --> 31:16.680
...we were number 4 on the list.

31:17.200 --> 31:19.000
And what happened since then....

31:20.360 --> 31:21.840
It's impossible.

31:22.240 --> 31:24.640
He's just two donations
away from normalcy.

31:25.440 --> 31:27.920
Two donors turning
up in such a short time....

31:28.600 --> 31:30.240
It's a miracle, Danny.

31:32.680 --> 31:34.440
There are no miracles in life, Aruna.

31:36.800 --> 31:38.240
Just the once you create.

31:39.800 --> 31:41.360
Then create one for us.

31:42.760 --> 31:44.360
The mail clearly states that...

31:45.040 --> 31:47.360
...you're requested
to move... with your family.

32:06.120 --> 32:07.040
Did you have your food?

32:07.840 --> 32:08.920
Yes, I'm eating the food you packed.

32:09.000 --> 32:09.960
How did it taste?

32:10.400 --> 32:12.880
The vegetables...
are still... umm... fresh.

32:12.960 --> 32:14.400
Really delicious.

32:14.760 --> 32:16.280
Sir, should I get more
kebabs for you?

32:16.360 --> 32:17.040
Kebabs...?

32:17.120 --> 32:18.080
What kebabs?

32:18.160 --> 32:19.200
Get lost.

32:19.280 --> 32:20.160
Where are you?

32:20.240 --> 32:21.920
No... not to you.
- Where did this kebabs come from?

32:22.600 --> 32:24.920
Hey! What am I asking you?

32:25.440 --> 32:27.400
Yeah... coming, Kabir sir.

32:27.600 --> 32:28.000
Listen, hubby!

32:28.080 --> 32:29.440
I'll speak to you later.

32:38.040 --> 32:39.760
Did you pledge your organs?

32:41.640 --> 32:42.600
No, sir.

32:43.600 --> 32:45.720
The other day I just
said it for the heck of it.

32:46.040 --> 32:48.880
Honestly speaking... it's scary.

32:50.240 --> 32:52.920
What if someday I'm
admitted to a hospital...

32:53.040 --> 32:55.800
...and those guys just take
my organs out while I'm still alive!

32:59.040 --> 33:01.040
This girl donated six of her organs.

33:01.120 --> 33:03.000
How many?
- Six."

33:04.560 --> 33:06.040
She isn't just saying it,
she's reading it out.

33:09.400 --> 33:11.040
You see... Rahul donated his organs.

33:11.120 --> 33:12.840
Even this actress
donated her organs.

33:12.920 --> 33:14.080
This gave me an idea, that...

33:14.160 --> 33:16.320
...we should donate
our organs as well.

33:16.400 --> 33:18.240
When Rahul's bike was recovered...

33:18.320 --> 33:20.880
...his helmet was
tied at the back, Sir.

33:24.440 --> 33:26.600
I need a zonal list of
All organ donors in Mumbai.

33:26.800 --> 33:29.680
Hmmm?
- I want it now.

33:30.880 --> 33:33.640
Can I finish this first?
- No, come on.

33:34.000 --> 33:35.680
Clear the bill, come.
- Sir.

33:37.840 --> 33:40.720
Hey... pack everything up, fast.

33:46.440 --> 33:48.040
There are so many organ donors.

33:48.680 --> 33:50.040
How do we go through these?

33:54.200 --> 33:58.200
Here's another list of donors.
Check this, too.

34:01.360 --> 34:02.440
Sir.

34:05.120 --> 34:07.080
It's the organ mafia, sir.
100 percent.

34:07.800 --> 34:11.440
No... that's not possible.

34:12.240 --> 34:13.080
Why?

34:13.280 --> 34:15.040
It's not the organ
mafia's modus operandi.

34:15.280 --> 34:18.880
Kill the victims... and then
donate their organs.

34:19.080 --> 34:20.880
Then there can be only one culprit.

34:21.000 --> 34:22.000
Who?

34:22.120 --> 34:23.040
Coincidence.

34:24.000 --> 34:26.000
Two people were on the same organ
donors list and they both died.

34:26.080 --> 34:27.040
Coincidence.

34:28.120 --> 34:29.880
Let it go, sir... this is enough.

34:34.960 --> 34:36.840
Doctor. Expert opinion.

34:37.000 --> 34:38.040
Come on! Let's go!

34:42.400 --> 34:45.840
Due to recent organ scams... many
cases have come into the limelight.

34:46.040 --> 34:48.760
Illegal organ transplant
is next to impossible.

34:48.840 --> 34:50.880
Well, this includes many parameters.

34:50.960 --> 34:54.360
Healthy organs,
police NOC, family permissions.

34:54.760 --> 34:57.360
And the most important
factor in organ donation...

34:57.640 --> 35:00.040
...is that the donor and recipient
must have the same blood group.

35:20.040 --> 35:22.040
Rahul's and Anita's families...

35:22.120 --> 35:24.440
...had given their approval
for organ donation.

35:25.000 --> 35:27.880
They had a rare blood group,
but it was the same.

35:28.800 --> 35:30.880
Around 9 people got a new life.

35:31.840 --> 35:36.000
Nice people.
May their souls rest in peace.

35:58.160 --> 35:59.680
Rahul's and Anita's families...

35:59.760 --> 36:01.680
...had given their approval
for organ donation.

36:01.840 --> 36:03.920
They had a rare blood group,
but it was the same.

36:04.000 --> 36:08.120
Sir, here's a list of
AB negative recipients and donors.

36:09.920 --> 36:13.840
We'll go after the donors.
- Why, sir?

36:20.000 --> 36:22.280
Anita and Rahul were both donors
with AB negative blood group.

36:23.200 --> 36:24.400
Whoever the killer is...

36:24.800 --> 36:27.000
...he's going after
AB negative donors.

36:30.240 --> 36:31.440
Shortlist them.

36:33.720 --> 36:34.680
Right, sir.

37:04.160 --> 37:05.880
Sir, may I go?

37:05.960 --> 37:07.840
It's quite late.
- Carry on.

37:44.000 --> 37:48.120
Sir! Kabir sir, come quickly.
