00:02.199 --> 00:04.260
Previous on Boston Legal.

00:04.369 --> 00:06.430
I always fantasize
about my murder trial.

00:06.537 --> 00:09.908
- I think next time, I'll leave little clues.
- What do you mean, next time?

00:10.009 --> 00:11.911
Hey, listen.
I think you remember Reverend Dumdum.

00:12.011 --> 00:14.779
Well, it turns out,
the reverend is also lawyer.

00:14.881 --> 00:17.444
I've decided to let him
handle my divorce.

00:17.550 --> 00:19.611
Instead of targeting the ex-husband,
we go after the reverend.

00:19.719 --> 00:23.251
- The reverend?
- Three sexual harassment complaints.

00:23.357 --> 00:25.623
- The man has a weakness.
- What exactly did he say about killing?

00:25.726 --> 00:28.893
- It makes him feel godly.
- It was very empowering, taking a life.

00:28.997 --> 00:32.128
That's not something
we can arrest him for.

00:34.000 --> 00:40.074

00:50.856 --> 00:54.090
- We need to talk, Alan.
- No, we don't. You've befallen for a former boyfriend.

00:54.193 --> 00:56.095
You've decided to go back to him.
So be it.

01:01.936 --> 01:03.838
I would like to talk about it.

01:03.938 --> 01:09.075
Why? To put a tidy little bow on it
in celebration of the friendship?

01:09.177 --> 01:13.141
We're breaking up, Tara.
Let's not turn it into Hallmark moment.

01:13.248 --> 01:17.188
- The root of our relationship was a friendship.
- That was perhaps _our root.

01:17.287 --> 01:19.519
for me, it's the little things.

01:19.622 --> 01:22.527
Sharing a glass of wine
as we do the crossword...

01:22.626 --> 01:24.960
early morning coffee...

01:25.063 --> 01:27.329
listening to Books on Tape...

01:27.431 --> 01:31.372
while I teethe on your left breast.

01:32.604 --> 01:35.098
Tara.

01:38.078 --> 01:40.413
Sorry.

01:40.514 --> 01:44.010
I have little doubt
you're doing what's best for you.

01:47.489 --> 01:49.892
I decided not to go back to him.

01:49.992 --> 01:51.894
Then what is it
we're not talking about?

01:53.596 --> 01:56.397
As much as it might not be him...

01:56.499 --> 02:00.235
I suppose he made me realize
that it isn't you either.

02:02.506 --> 02:04.408
As much as I love you...

02:04.509 --> 02:07.504
and I do very much...

02:09.615 --> 02:11.517
I need to move on.

02:15.855 --> 02:17.757
I suppose it's better than moving in.

02:17.857 --> 02:21.593
I really believe if woman
is going to move on...

02:21.695 --> 02:24.826
she should be required to move away.

02:24.932 --> 02:28.235
A woman once left me 'cause
the way I grunted during sex...

02:28.335 --> 02:31.035
reminded her other potbellied pig.

02:33.176 --> 02:35.112
You grunt like a pig during sex?

02:35.210 --> 02:39.619
Mom. And when I fell asleep after,
she said I snored like her pig too.

02:39.716 --> 02:42.882
You just can't win.
Relationships end for all sorts of reasons.

02:42.986 --> 02:45.287
The only thing you can do
is go fishing.

02:49.227 --> 02:52.962
Cancel the rest of your week, Alan.
I'm taking you to Nimmo Bay.

02:53.065 --> 02:56.061
Don't be ridiculous.

02:57.536 --> 03:00.441
This is not a meaningful life-

03:00.540 --> 03:03.603
practicing law, drinking scotch
at 9:OO in the morning.

03:03.711 --> 03:05.613
Well, maybe the scotch is meaningful.

03:05.713 --> 03:08.276
But practicing law, making money...

03:08.382 --> 03:10.910
settling petty disputes-

03:11.019 --> 03:14.117
Life is in British Columbia...

03:14.224 --> 03:17.527
in the Great Bear Rain Forest.

03:17.627 --> 03:21.499
- God is out there, Alan.
- God likes to fish?

03:21.598 --> 03:25.471
We need to go to the woods
and touch ourselves-

03:25.569 --> 03:27.596
get in touch with ourselves.

03:30.609 --> 03:34.140
Man can only truly bond
in the woods.

03:34.247 --> 03:38.348
Come on, Alan. Let's go fishing.

04:34.950 --> 04:37.581
I'm not a good flyer,
especially helicopters.

04:37.687 --> 04:39.589
I don't understand the aerodynamics.

04:39.690 --> 04:43.323
And I'm feeling
quite inclined to vomit.

04:43.427 --> 04:47.732
- There's fish down there, man.
- I n that case-

04:58.377 --> 05:01.214
Coming up to it. Look, there.

05:01.315 --> 05:03.444
the Naiad Explorer.

05:03.550 --> 05:07.457
There it is- Nimmo Bay.

05:14.230 --> 05:16.758
They're surrendering.
Do they think we're attacking?

05:16.866 --> 05:20.397
That's how they welcome the guests.

05:20.503 --> 05:23.635
Denny, this may not be the time...

05:23.741 --> 05:25.904
but I hate nature.

05:48.870 --> 05:52.002
Mrs. Piper?

05:52.107 --> 05:55.011
- Detective Stephenson. Remember me?
- No.

05:55.110 --> 05:57.343
There someplace we can talk?

05:59.783 --> 06:04.282
After you came to see us, we decided to put
a tracking device on Bernard Fermionsâ€™ car.

06:04.388 --> 06:07.691
He hasn't used it for a week.
We knocked on his door, talked to neighbors.

06:07.792 --> 06:10.161
Nobody's seen him.
We entered his house, looked around.

06:10.262 --> 06:13.997
- Seems he's vanished.
- Really? Gee.

06:15.968 --> 06:19.305
- When was the last time you saw him?
- About a week ago, I guess.

06:19.406 --> 06:23.507
I had dinner at his house,
let's see, on Friday.

06:23.610 --> 06:26.138
That's the last day anybody saw him.
What'd you talk about?

06:26.247 --> 06:30.712
Well, if you must know,
I- I decided to end our friendship.

06:30.819 --> 06:33.518
Maybe he went fishing.
I hear men do that.

06:33.621 --> 06:36.685
- And did he know that you tried to turn him in?
- No!

06:39.062 --> 06:41.328
If you hear from him,
would you let us know?

06:41.431 --> 06:43.629
Of course.

06:52.610 --> 06:55.344
- I'm making progress.
- What progress?

06:55.448 --> 06:59.013
Just get him compromised and proceed
directly to blackmail. Do not pass "Go. "

06:59.118 --> 07:02.148
First offal
I am not about to blackmail.

07:02.256 --> 07:04.158
- In so many words.
- And, second...

07:04.258 --> 07:08.062
when I decide to screw somebody,
even figuratively, I still like foreplay.

07:08.163 --> 07:10.657
- Nice.
- The man isn't stupid, Garrett.

07:10.765 --> 07:13.099
I need to move slowly.

07:13.201 --> 07:17.610
Please, dear Father,
give us the serenity to find accord...

07:17.707 --> 07:20.770
the compassion to find
victory in fairness...

07:20.877 --> 07:25.377
and to remember that despite our differences,
we remain one man under God.

07:25.483 --> 07:27.214
- Amen.
- Amen.

07:27.318 --> 07:31.555
Okay, we last left off
on vacation allowances.

07:31.656 --> 07:34.959
- I still have to deny that.
- He was accustomed during the marriage to-

07:35.060 --> 07:37.121
As a luxury.

07:41.134 --> 07:43.970
I like that we start with a prayer.
Thank you for that.

07:49.577 --> 07:51.740
You're a nice person.

07:56.718 --> 07:59.087
Can we table the vacation
allowance for now...

07:59.188 --> 08:01.090
and get back to health insurance?

08:01.190 --> 08:04.756
- Sure.
- Give me a sec to just run these numbers.

08:19.912 --> 08:24.617
OO.

08:24.718 --> 08:26.985
Make up your mind. What time is it?

08:27.088 --> 08:29.787
Forward cast stops at 1 O,
back cast at two.

08:29.891 --> 08:32.624
You want to let the rod do the work.

08:32.727 --> 08:34.960
When will it finally be my turn?

08:35.063 --> 08:36.966
You guides aren't very good at sharing.

08:48.846 --> 08:52.013
Okay, it's not a fly swatter.

08:52.117 --> 08:56.057
- Where are all the fish?
- Can't hit the river till you learn to cast.

08:56.155 --> 08:59.754
Look at you roughing it
in the great outdoors.

08:59.859 --> 09:02.854
- Ten and two.
- Stop with the time.

09:13.675 --> 09:15.736
- Hello, Catherine.
- Hello.

09:15.844 --> 09:18.407
May I help you?

09:18.515 --> 09:20.678
Well, I, uh-

09:23.887 --> 09:26.415
I may have a situation.

09:26.524 --> 09:28.927
Okay.

09:29.027 --> 09:33.560
I had befriended a man-
Bernard Ferro-

09:33.666 --> 09:36.433
a seemingly benign little person...

09:36.536 --> 09:39.667
who had killed both
his mother and neighbor.

09:39.772 --> 09:43.907
This firm represented him.
Alan got him off both times.

09:44.010 --> 09:47.108
- Are you aware of any of this?
- Some.

09:47.214 --> 09:52.715
Well, at his core,
I maintained Bernard was not evil...

09:52.821 --> 09:55.918
which is, I suppose,
in part why I befriended him.

09:56.024 --> 10:00.626
But I suddenly became convinced
he was evil and would kill again.

10:00.730 --> 10:05.799
I went to the police and revealed
some things that may have been privileged.

10:05.903 --> 10:09.638
I'm sorry about that.
But my conscience-

10:09.740 --> 10:13.511
Anaya, the police said
little could be done...

10:13.612 --> 10:15.605
which stunned me, of course.

10:15.715 --> 10:18.152
Well, I became hurried,
I suppose...

10:18.250 --> 10:20.152
at the prospect of-

10:20.253 --> 10:24.159
of Bernard taking more human life.

10:24.257 --> 10:26.159
And?

10:28.863 --> 10:30.662
I killed him.

10:35.337 --> 10:38.002
What do you mean, you killed him?

10:38.107 --> 10:41.012
I bludgeoned him
with his own skillet.

10:41.111 --> 10:45.849
And now, the police are asking questions,
and I don't know what to do.

10:46.984 --> 10:51.517
Catherine, you killed a man?

10:51.623 --> 10:53.856
Yes, dear.

10:57.296 --> 11:00.359
If only your prolonged staring
could bring him back.

11:03.936 --> 11:07.377
She doesn't want us to go to the police.
She's not looking to turn herself in...

11:07.475 --> 11:10.937
so much as I guess she wants
to be prepared should she be arrested.

11:11.045 --> 11:13.208
She killed one of our clients?

11:13.314 --> 11:16.310
First, we have to make sure we don't have
some legal obligation to report it.

11:16.418 --> 11:18.719
We don't.
Her confession to you is privileged.

11:18.821 --> 11:21.156
What about our duty to Bernard Ferro?
He was a client.

11:21.258 --> 11:23.057
I'm not sure our duty there
would survive his death.

11:23.160 --> 11:25.859
Hit him on the head with a skillet?

11:25.962 --> 11:28.901
It would be a public relations nightmare if
it got out that we knew and said nothing.

11:29.000 --> 11:30.993
We need to convince her
to confess to the police.

11:31.102 --> 11:34.007
- I don't think she has any intention of doing that.
- Where's the body?

11:34.106 --> 11:36.577
- Evidently, in his basement.
- She just killed him?

11:36.676 --> 11:39.409
Yes, Paul, she killed him.
He's dead. Can we move on?

11:39.512 --> 11:41.881
- Tara, is this woman insane?
- Clearly, she must be.

11:41.981 --> 11:45.216
- She has to be fired.
- That would be an indirect violation of privilege.

11:45.319 --> 11:47.516
- If that action could indirectly-
- She kills clients!

11:47.621 --> 11:51.528
- Shah!
- I think we need to convince her to go to the police.

11:51.626 --> 11:55.031
- And if she refuses?
- We lie, tell her the police are about to find out.

11:55.130 --> 11:57.931
We can't lie to her, Paul.
She's a de facto client.

11:58.034 --> 12:01.268
Doing nothing here could devastate
the moral integrity of this firm.

12:01.370 --> 12:03.534
Where is Alan Shore?
He has a relationship with her.

12:03.640 --> 12:05.405
- He's in Canada.
- Tara dumped him.

12:05.509 --> 12:07.605
- Is he reachable?
- Apparently not.

12:07.712 --> 12:10.240
Well, Shirley, you need to persuade
the woman to confess.

12:10.348 --> 12:12.615
- Even if itâ€™s to her legal detriment?
- Yes!

12:14.386 --> 12:16.949
Sometimes, the firm
has to come first.

12:31.707 --> 12:36.547
Ah, you can see them
in there. Look at the crystal Clearwater.

12:36.646 --> 12:40.450
My fly went right by his nose.
Eat it, you picky bastard.

12:40.550 --> 12:43.819
Should I be concerned
that the guy brought a gun?

12:43.920 --> 12:47.793
Well, you never know
when a grizzly'll wander out.

12:47.893 --> 12:50.330
Relax.

12:50.428 --> 12:52.330
Just catch a fish, would you, please?

12:52.430 --> 12:55.631
Unlike you, I didn't eat back at
the lodge. Who cooks it, by the way?

12:55.735 --> 12:59.175
- It's catch and release.
- What do you mean?

12:59.272 --> 13:02.643
- We let 'em go.
- What do you mean, we let 'em go?

13:02.743 --> 13:05.978
We just traveled 3,500 miles.
We don't get to eat them?

13:07.715 --> 13:10.516
I brought you out here
to expose you to-to-

13:10.618 --> 13:13.682
The fish, which I'm now told
we can't eat.

13:13.789 --> 13:18.356
Once you see one and hold one
in your hand- Not that you will.

13:18.460 --> 13:21.831
They're almost impossible to catch.
But I might if the gods favor me.

13:21.932 --> 13:25.668
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait a second.
Did you say I might not even get one?

13:25.770 --> 13:28.674
It's called fishing, man,
not catching.

13:28.773 --> 13:31.176
No, no, no, no.
You haul me hallway across the world...

13:31.275 --> 13:34.544
to help me get over
my painful breakup with-

13:34.646 --> 13:39.487
- Tara.
- And now, you're telling me the fish are uncatchable?

13:39.585 --> 13:45.188
By beginners! I'll get one
if you just shut up and let me fish!

13:54.502 --> 13:56.905
Ah! Ah! Whoa!

13:57.005 --> 14:00.035
- Fish on!
- Hey! He got one! Look at that!

14:00.142 --> 14:02.009
- What do I do?
- You've got one on your line!

14:02.111 --> 14:05.243
- All right, tip up!
- Don't lose your balance, man! Stand up!

14:05.349 --> 14:07.684
You've got one on your line!
Don't horse it in!

14:07.785 --> 14:10.416
fight him, man! fight him!

14:14.025 --> 14:17.830
The odds are, Catherine,
the police will find out.

14:17.931 --> 14:21.837
It is our united feeling that the best way
to achieve the most leniency...

14:21.935 --> 14:25.740
is for you to go to the police of your
own accord and tell them what happened.

14:27.341 --> 14:31.281
- You're lying, dear.
- Why would I lie?

14:31.379 --> 14:33.976
Because the worst thing
that can happen to this firm...

14:34.081 --> 14:38.421
is for it to become public that one
of your employees murdered a client...

14:38.521 --> 14:41.459
and you sat on the information.

14:42.558 --> 14:44.461
I may not be a lawyer...

14:44.561 --> 14:47.795
but it seems to me
that if confess...

14:47.899 --> 14:50.735
it might make things
easier for them.

14:53.538 --> 14:56.636
Catherine, on the one hand...

14:56.742 --> 14:59.771
you tried to introduce
Bernard Ferro to your faith...

14:59.880 --> 15:02.373
in the hopes of saving his soul.

15:02.482 --> 15:04.577
But denying this man a funeral...

15:04.684 --> 15:08.489
his opportunity
to rest in peace with God...

15:08.589 --> 15:13.658
that isn't in keeping
with his salvation.

15:14.863 --> 15:19.806
Did you commit this act
because he was evil...

15:19.903 --> 15:22.568
or because you are?

15:22.672 --> 15:25.007
Because he was.

15:25.108 --> 15:28.411
Then I would advise you,
do not let his final legacy...

15:28.512 --> 15:32.851
be the destruction of your
moral and spiritual character.

15:32.951 --> 15:35.821
This firm will defend you.
I give you my word.

15:35.922 --> 15:38.358
You will have this firm's
full resources.

15:39.926 --> 15:41.828
I want Alan Shore.

15:45.966 --> 15:49.371
If can get him back to the charity of
heart discount of six and a quarter-

15:49.470 --> 15:53.036
- I couldn't sell it.
- I have a hard time believing that, Sara.

15:53.141 --> 15:57.138
You seem so incredibly... compelling.

15:57.245 --> 16:01.813
Surely you can move Denise a little.

16:01.918 --> 16:05.824
Perhaps in the way... you move me.

16:10.261 --> 16:14.224
I'm afraid I'm going to have- to have
another attorney handle this matter.

16:14.332 --> 16:17.237
- I beg your pardon?
- Divorce law isn't my specialty.

16:17.336 --> 16:19.329
I feel Denise's interests
aren't best being served.

16:19.438 --> 16:22.343
You're doing wonderful work here.
We're almost to the meeting of the minds.

16:22.442 --> 16:26.246
It's not the meeting of
the minds that concerns me.

16:27.948 --> 16:31.753
- I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said that.
- What did you mean by it?

16:31.853 --> 16:35.349
Nothing. I apologize.
But I'm going to have to ask you to leave.

16:39.128 --> 16:41.759
Okay.

16:44.535 --> 16:46.767
I'm attracted to you.

16:48.072 --> 16:51.534
I mean, I'm not.
I just think I am...

16:51.643 --> 16:56.108
which is to say I have a problem.

17:00.053 --> 17:01.955
A problem?

17:02.055 --> 17:07.796
Um, I shouldn't be
litigating with clergy.

17:07.895 --> 17:09.762
What do you mean?

17:09.864 --> 17:14.101
This has to just be between us.
You can't tell your client.

17:14.203 --> 17:17.267
- Should it ever get back to my client-
- No, I give you my word.

17:17.372 --> 17:19.809
I, uh-

17:23.546 --> 17:27.453
I have... a clergy fetish.

17:31.522 --> 17:33.425
Clergy fetish?

17:33.525 --> 17:38.263
I've been secretly prolonging these
negotiations just to be close to you.

17:41.935 --> 17:45.466
Perhaps I can help.

17:47.040 --> 17:48.840
- You need to leave.
- No, Sara-

17:48.943 --> 17:53.351
You need to go now, Reverend.
Just go.

18:04.227 --> 18:06.460
- How did we do?
- He's ready to fall.

18:06.563 --> 18:09.536
- When?
- He'll be back.

18:09.634 --> 18:11.536
And I'll close it.

18:25.052 --> 18:27.455
I can't believe I'm here doing this.

18:27.554 --> 18:30.458
We have to at least see the scene
before calling the police.

18:30.557 --> 18:34.828
- Why do they always put the dead bodies in the basement?
- So they can still entertain.

18:39.802 --> 18:43.367
Well, there's nothing down here.
Looks like she lied to us.

18:43.472 --> 18:45.909
Look.

18:50.014 --> 18:52.850
Did she say he was in an icebox?

18:52.950 --> 18:55.251
Nope.

18:55.353 --> 18:57.050
- Open it.
- You open it.

18:57.156 --> 19:00.061
- Why me?
- You're a man. Do the math.

19:04.030 --> 19:08.096
Oh, no. I'm not opening it.
I still can't believe I'm even here.

19:08.202 --> 19:11.869
I make over million dollars a year, and
I'm in a basement looking for a dead midget.

19:38.904 --> 19:41.101
Fish on!

19:41.208 --> 19:43.576
Another one? What's he got on?

19:43.676 --> 19:45.772
He's bigger than the last one.
Look, Denny. Look.

19:45.879 --> 19:48.146
- I see. I see.
- Keep your tip up.

19:48.249 --> 19:51.484
Tip up. That's it. Now, let him run.

19:51.586 --> 19:55.583
Oh, my God! I saw his mouth!
He had a smile, Denny.

19:55.690 --> 19:58.663
He likes being caught.
Did you see how happy he looked?

19:58.761 --> 20:02.462
Okay, gain some line on her.
Reel it in.

20:04.067 --> 20:06.334
Hold on.
Let me check your drag there.

20:06.436 --> 20:09.773
The guide is bonding.

20:09.874 --> 20:13.815
This is unbelievable, Denny.
You have no idea.

20:13.912 --> 20:18.115
You really should tee catching one.
Oh, my God.

20:18.217 --> 20:20.380
Oh! Oh!

20:37.440 --> 20:39.911
You promised me Alan Shore.

20:40.009 --> 20:42.810
You'll get him as soon
as he gets back from Canada.

20:42.913 --> 20:47.651
- Why can't you just call him?
- Because he has his satellite phone turned off.

20:47.751 --> 20:50.188
You'll get him, Catherine.
I promise.

20:50.288 --> 20:54.889
In the meantime, arraignment
is set for 9:OO a. m. tomorrow.

20:54.993 --> 20:59.058
Between now and then,
do not talk to anybody.

20:59.164 --> 21:01.328
And I realize, Catherine,
that for you...

21:01.434 --> 21:03.370
this represents the challenge
of a lifetime.

21:03.470 --> 21:06.875
We need to keep
all our defense options open...

21:06.974 --> 21:09.878
and for that to happen,
you cannot talk.

21:25.761 --> 21:29.532
Excuse me. Is it unusual
to catch five cohos in one day?

21:29.633 --> 21:32.400
I mean, while your
fishing partner catches none?

21:32.504 --> 21:35.203
If you caught five,
I'd say you had a bit of luck.

21:35.307 --> 21:38.872
- Beginner's luck.
- You're not competitive over this sort of thing, are you?

21:40.546 --> 21:42.607
Could you pass me
the ashtray, please?

21:45.886 --> 21:48.790
Ah, thank you.
I'd have reached for it myself...

21:48.889 --> 21:53.126
but my shoulders are a bit sore
from all that reeling.

21:53.227 --> 21:55.790
- How many did you catch?
- I didn't fish.

21:55.898 --> 21:58.870
Ah! So that would put you
about even with Denny.

21:58.967 --> 22:01.963
tam sorry. Are you Denny Crane?

22:02.071 --> 22:04.064
I am, and I'm not your father.

22:04.173 --> 22:07.408
I'm Peter Barrett.
I'm an attorney, actually.

22:07.511 --> 22:10.312
- And I'm a big admirer.
- Fine. I'm still not your father.

22:10.415 --> 22:13.911
- You're a salmon fisher, Mr. Crane?
- I catch 'em in my sleep.

22:14.019 --> 22:16.080
That must be the only place
he catches them.

22:16.187 --> 22:18.954
I see why Tara dumped you.

22:19.058 --> 22:22.121
- I'm about to.
- There's no Tara. Don't be deceived.

22:22.228 --> 22:24.426
Denny and I are lovers.

22:24.531 --> 22:27.663
I'm a heterosexual,
and I catch salmon like one.

22:27.768 --> 22:30.331
Well, you won't be catching them
for long, I'm afraid.

22:30.438 --> 22:32.431
Wild Pacific salmon
are being wiped out.

22:32.540 --> 22:35.342
- What are you talking about?
- Sea lice are killing them.

22:35.444 --> 22:38.713
- The weight of evidence points toward the fish farms.
- Fish farms?

22:38.814 --> 22:41.148
The penned fish
in the fish farms host the lice...

22:41.250 --> 22:45.248
which attach themselves to the baby
wild salmon migrating past the pens.

22:45.355 --> 22:47.349
And it's destroying them.
I'm actually here...

22:47.458 --> 22:49.826
because I'm going into court
in Port McNeill tomorrow...

22:49.927 --> 22:52.363
to tyro enjoin
another fish farm from going in.

22:52.464 --> 22:57.304
Boy, would I love to go in
with the Denny Crane by my side.

22:57.402 --> 22:59.167
You one of those
environmental lawyers?

22:59.271 --> 23:02.142
- Is there something wrong with that?
- They're evildoers.

23:02.241 --> 23:05.646
Yesterday, it's a tree.
Today, it's a salmon.

23:05.745 --> 23:10.210
Tomorrow, it's "Let's not dig up Alaska
for oil 'cause it's too pretty. "

23:10.317 --> 23:13.449
Let me tell you something.
I came out here to enjoy nature.

23:13.555 --> 23:15.525
Don't talk to me
about the environment.

23:17.493 --> 23:19.896
All reality. None obit scripted.

23:30.508 --> 23:34.506
Sara, I must tell you,
I too have felt a connection.

23:34.613 --> 23:38.576
Maybe what youâ€™re feeling
isn't the product of a fetish so much...

23:38.683 --> 23:42.054
as two of Godâ€™s children
desirous of coming together.

23:43.523 --> 23:46.188
- Take off your collar.
- I'm sorry?

23:46.292 --> 23:48.889
I want to see you as a man
fore second, not as a minister.

23:48.995 --> 23:52.766
Please, take it off.

23:52.867 --> 23:55.498
Now give it to me.

24:09.720 --> 24:13.717
- Have you come to make love to me, Reverend?
- Yes.

24:13.824 --> 24:16.227
We need to settle the case first...

24:16.327 --> 24:20.997
at a number where
I can't possibly be accused of any...

24:21.100 --> 24:23.469
conflict of interest.

24:23.570 --> 24:25.472
390.

24:31.579 --> 24:36.454
- I can sell it to him.
- Can we make love here?

24:36.552 --> 24:39.889
I don't want to go anther.
I just want to do it right here.

24:39.988 --> 24:43.986
- It's what God wants.
- Can I watch?

24:44.094 --> 24:47.932
- Reverend, Reverend, you little slut.
- What's going on?

24:48.031 --> 24:51.004
What's going on is
you selling out your client forest.

24:51.102 --> 24:53.095
It's what God wants.

24:53.204 --> 24:56.666
I'm shocked.
This is what's going to happen.

24:56.774 --> 24:58.836
You're going to tell your client
he'll get a check for $1 OO, OOO.

24:58.944 --> 25:01.005
He'll take it because
it's more than he deserves.

25:01.114 --> 25:03.016
Perhaps more than he'll get
if he goes to trial.

25:03.116 --> 25:05.519
- I'll report the both of you.
- To who?

25:05.619 --> 25:08.854
Your church or mine? 1 OO grand.

25:08.956 --> 25:11.860
Think on it. Pray on it.

25:11.959 --> 25:13.929
Off you go now.

25:30.180 --> 25:30.180
Oh, my God.

25:32.283 --> 25:32.510
Oh, my God.

25:32.617 --> 25:38.392
_t\is boo_ A Stain Upon the Sea,
it's all about these sea lice.

25:38.490 --> 25:40.392
Interesting.

25:40.492 --> 25:44.992
- They call them "cling-ones. "
- Did you say "Clintons"?

25:45.098 --> 25:49.061
They really could wipe out salmon
if something isn't done.

25:49.170 --> 25:51.869
- They have to do something.
- Mm-hmm.

25:51.972 --> 25:54.375
- Mm-hmm.
- Mom!

25:54.476 --> 25:59.248
- Donâ€™t you care?
- What's the worst-case scenario?

25:59.347 --> 26:01.545
They're extinct in 20 years or so?

26:01.651 --> 26:05.854
I'm 72. I'll be extinct in 1 O.
What do I care?

26:05.955 --> 26:09.919
That would be humorous if so many people
didn't think exactly that way.

26:11.663 --> 26:16.971
When does the male bonding part
come in on this trip?

26:17.068 --> 26:19.437
I'm not into
the Canadian weenie welding.

26:21.473 --> 26:25.244
What scares you most in life, Denny?

26:25.345 --> 26:29.616
I told you.

26:29.717 --> 26:34.125
I got the mad cow,
and my penis only works on medication.

26:34.222 --> 26:36.124
Yes. Besides that.

26:37.559 --> 26:39.792
Dying?

26:39.895 --> 26:42.628
I've died many times.

26:42.732 --> 26:44.759
Can we talk about
something other than sex?

26:47.070 --> 26:49.803
What about you? What scares you?

26:51.442 --> 26:54.347
Being alone, I guess.

26:54.446 --> 26:58.409
Don't get me wrong. I love solitude.
I like it best in relationships.

27:00.252 --> 27:03.784
Well-

27:03.891 --> 27:06.988
It's going to feel strange
not having Tara in my bed.

27:07.093 --> 27:09.827
I've always had this feeling...

27:09.930 --> 27:12.697
and I've never shared it with anybody,
but I'm convinced...

27:12.800 --> 27:16.604
in a past life,
I was murdered in my sleep.

27:18.674 --> 27:22.341
- You're a wacko.
- I'm trying to be vulnerable here.

27:22.444 --> 27:25.349
- Could you toss me a bone? Give me something?
- I know what youâ€™re doing.

27:26.783 --> 27:29.847
And I'm not sleeping with you.
Forget about it.

27:29.953 --> 27:33.358
Turn off the light.
You're not getting' my bone.

27:43.703 --> 27:47.804
Don't take this personally.

27:47.908 --> 27:50.243
It keeps away the bad dreams.

27:50.344 --> 27:53.407
Understood.

27:53.515 --> 27:56.453
- Denny?
- Hmm?

27:56.551 --> 27:59.148
I'm really glad we did this.

28:01.557 --> 28:03.754
Me too.

28:49.580 --> 28:51.482
- What are you doing in my bed?
- I don't know!

28:51.582 --> 28:55.489
- What do you mean, you don't know?
- I... got scared.

28:55.587 --> 28:58.388
I thought I heard a bear outside.

28:58.490 --> 29:00.688
And then,
I couldn't fall back asleep.

29:00.793 --> 29:03.287
Turns out, I find pig sounds
rather soothing.

29:03.396 --> 29:06.232
Plus, your snoring is so rhythmic.

29:06.332 --> 29:12.244
I just... laid down to calm myself.

29:12.339 --> 29:15.244
- I'm sorry.
- We slept together.

29:15.343 --> 29:18.748
I won't tell. I promise.

29:29.392 --> 29:33.163
- $1 OO, OOO? And we're done?
- Yes.

29:36.100 --> 29:38.765
May I ask why?

29:38.870 --> 29:42.538
Well, basically, Rev. Dumdum convinced me
that coming out of this financially richer...

29:42.642 --> 29:46.343
isn't worth it at the expense
of my, um- well, dignity.

29:46.446 --> 29:50.285
The truth is, Denise,
I can provide for myself.

29:50.384 --> 29:55.019
And I will make that tour. Having to go
a little hungry is perhaps exactly what I need.

29:55.122 --> 30:00.259
If inherit success,
t can never earn it.

30:01.630 --> 30:05.969
So this is, uh-
this is what I'm doing.

30:09.372 --> 30:14.372
Okay. I admire that.

30:14.479 --> 30:19.046
Reverend Dumdum, I admit
I doubted your integrity. I'm sorry.

30:19.150 --> 30:21.485
I accept your apology.

30:23.422 --> 30:28.331
Well, upon execution of the papers,
I'll cut a check.

30:28.428 --> 30:30.330
I guess we're done.

30:50.787 --> 30:53.885
What did you do?

30:53.992 --> 30:56.463
We made a strong presentation
regarding the economics...

30:56.561 --> 30:59.260
of a trial balanced
by the risk factor of his losing.

30:59.364 --> 31:02.963
Then we made a compelling principle-based
argument targeting character.

31:03.069 --> 31:04.971
Ultimately, they were persuaded.

31:07.007 --> 31:09.171
What did you do?

31:12.479 --> 31:15.281
Hey, Denny!

31:15.383 --> 31:17.980
You might want to
speed up your retrieve!

31:18.086 --> 31:19.885
Oh, shut up.

31:21.657 --> 31:24.390
Bite it.
It's right in front of your mouth.

31:24.493 --> 31:28.400
Eat it, you miserable bastard!

31:28.498 --> 31:32.735
This one came in quickly.
Maybe word got out I don't eat them.

31:32.836 --> 31:37.905
I must be up to 1 S by now.
Not that I'm counting. Denny certainly isn't.

31:38.009 --> 31:40.412
- Picture?
- Why not?

31:43.749 --> 31:46.346
It couldn't be closer to your mouth.

31:46.452 --> 31:49.219
Oh, it's a steelhead.
You got a steelhead.

31:49.322 --> 31:51.520
Each more beautiful than the next.

31:51.625 --> 31:55.657
- Don't squeeze him too tight.
- You miserable bastard!

31:55.763 --> 31:57.665
God, these things are strong.

31:57.765 --> 32:00.704
They really are extraordinarily
beautiful creatures.

32:09.479 --> 32:11.848
Got one!

32:17.189 --> 32:20.025
Catherine, we have to over
some defense.

32:20.125 --> 32:23.394
Look at me, dear. I'm old.
Older than you, even.

32:23.495 --> 32:27.561
I'm not going to go out of
this world making excuses.

32:29.036 --> 32:31.667
I don't know what
your impression of prison is...

32:31.772 --> 32:34.471
but it's not the kind of place
where you can sit around...

32:34.575 --> 32:37.138
and knit afghans for a few months
and sell them afterwards.

32:37.245 --> 32:39.148
You are up on murder charges.

32:39.248 --> 32:41.309
He was going to kill again.

32:41.416 --> 32:44.149
The police wouldn't do anything.

32:44.253 --> 32:47.226
He had a look in his eye that
he might even whack me if crossed him.

32:47.323 --> 32:49.225
Well, I wasn't going to wait for that.

32:49.325 --> 32:52.891
I tried to introduce
the little weasel to God.

32:52.997 --> 32:58.600
Well, now he can meet him up close,
face-to-face.

33:05.779 --> 33:08.113
Can I fish yet?

33:08.214 --> 33:10.447
No, you still have a time out.
You just sit there.

33:17.125 --> 33:19.095
As you said yourself. Denny...

33:19.194 --> 33:22.258
these fish are positively majestic,
sacred even.

33:22.364 --> 33:26.703
- And you shot one.
- Sometimes, I get competitive.

33:26.803 --> 33:28.705
Really?

33:28.805 --> 33:31.471
You've upset the guide.

33:36.281 --> 33:38.809
I'll tell you this, Denny.
I see it now...

33:38.917 --> 33:41.548
how this kind of nature
can renew you spiritually.

33:41.653 --> 33:45.719
I really see it.
I'll tell you something else.

33:45.825 --> 33:48.490
In our day jobs,
we're lawyers, and we're good ones.

33:48.595 --> 33:51.065
- What's your point?
- My point is, given this...

33:51.164 --> 33:54.969
given those salmon, there's a hearing
going on in Port McNeill.

33:57.739 --> 34:00.233
We need to go be lawyers now.

34:17.295 --> 34:20.324
Your first logistical obstacle
is the robes.

34:20.431 --> 34:22.800
Canadian lawyers
appear in black robes.

34:22.900 --> 34:24.804
We should be able to borrow them.

34:24.904 --> 34:27.501
I fall else fails,
we can stop at a costume shop.

34:27.607 --> 34:29.702
- What else?
- The judges are called "Milord. "

34:29.810 --> 34:33.716
- Not "Your Honor;' but "Milord. " It's a lot like in England.
- What time is the motion?

34:33.813 --> 34:36.308
According to the docket, 11:OO a. m.
How far away are you?

34:36.418 --> 34:38.821
- Twenty minutes.
- Well, you'll probably join in progress then.

34:38.920 --> 34:40.822
Good luck. And, Alan-

34:43.926 --> 34:45.828
I miss you.

34:45.928 --> 34:48.491
Case number 932612.

34:48.597 --> 34:51.728
Commonwealth of Massachusetts
versus Catherine Piper...

34:51.835 --> 34:53.897
on the charge of murder
in the first degree.

34:54.005 --> 34:56.339
Shirley Schmidt for
the defendant, Your Honor.

34:56.442 --> 34:59.847
We'll waive reading
and enter a plea of not guilty.

34:59.945 --> 35:03.783
- I'd also like to enter the appearance of Alan Shore.
- Question of bail.

35:03.882 --> 35:07.755
My client has no criminal record,
Your Honor, dating back to the 1800s.

35:07.854 --> 35:10.758
She has strong roots in her community.
There is no flight risk-

35:10.857 --> 35:13.728
Personal recognizance
for a homicide case-

35:13.828 --> 35:16.231
Usually wouldnâ€™t apply.
But my client...

35:16.331 --> 35:19.098
may have special medical needs
due to her incredibly advanced years...

35:19.201 --> 35:22.106
and the criminal act
in question here...

35:22.205 --> 35:25.075
involves one lone incident
of self-defense.

35:25.174 --> 35:28.044
Excuse me.
You're pleading self-defense?

35:28.145 --> 35:30.615
We are.
The defense will stipulate to the fact...

35:30.714 --> 35:33.447
that she caused Bernard ferried
to cease living.

35:33.550 --> 35:36.078
We will stipulate to cause of death.

35:36.187 --> 35:39.125
The only issue before this court
will be justification.

35:39.224 --> 35:41.661
Hence, we move for a speedy
and immediate trial...

35:41.759 --> 35:45.291
citing, once again,
my client's advanced years.

35:45.398 --> 35:49.338
- Miss Murrow?
- We have no problem with a speedy trial.

35:49.436 --> 35:52.773
Bail is set at 300, OOO.
We'll conference to set up a trial date.

35:52.873 --> 35:55.573
The amative defense
of self-defense is so noted.

35:58.679 --> 36:01.584
Mrs. Piper, you choose
to address the court?

36:01.683 --> 36:05.589
- No.
- I just-

36:05.687 --> 36:08.660
Is it possible to request
the Robert Blake jury?

36:16.600 --> 36:18.502
Thereâ€™s just no
scientific evidence...

36:18.602 --> 36:20.937
the sea lice are causing the death
of wild salmon.

36:21.039 --> 36:22.941
That is ridiculous.
Sea lice wiped out...

36:23.042 --> 36:25.512
the salmon stock in Norway,
they wiped out the stock in Scotland.

36:25.611 --> 36:29.847
- All we're saying is let's wait and do the research-
- How much longer can we wait?

36:29.950 --> 36:32.444
- This is a vendetta against the farmed fish.
- There's no such thing.

36:32.554 --> 36:35.994
We have no issue with farmed fish
as long as they can raise their stock...

36:36.090 --> 36:40.156
in an environmentally sustainable manner
and not host millions of sea lice.

36:40.262 --> 36:43.132
- Closed containment systems have been shown to work.
- I've heard your arguments.

36:43.232 --> 36:47.071
I have your brie_. I'll review
the matter as well as the science.

36:47.170 --> 36:50.404
Greetings, oh, Canada. Denny Crane.

36:54.011 --> 36:55.844
Good morning, Milord.
My name is Alan Shore...

36:55.947 --> 36:58.680
and Mr. Crane and I are attorneys from
the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

36:58.783 --> 37:02.348
We seek permission to be heard
on this issue as friends of the court.

37:02.455 --> 37:05.154
Mr. Shore,
we don't earwigs in Canada.

37:06.292 --> 37:08.763
Oh.

37:10.197 --> 37:12.690
Nor do we wear waders.

37:12.800 --> 37:17.105
Milord, weâ€™ve just spent the last two days
in your rivers in your county side.

37:17.205 --> 37:21.544
It is the most spectacular
nature I have ever seen.

37:21.643 --> 37:26.449
And the fish, they are enough
to make one believe in a higher power.

37:26.550 --> 37:29.020
Yes. How many of the higher power's
creations did you torture?

37:29.119 --> 37:33.390
Fifteen. Denny didn't catch any.
I get your implication, Judge...

37:33.491 --> 37:36.622
and I acknowledge the hypocrisy
of the fisherman...

37:36.727 --> 37:38.630
pleading for the survival of a species...

37:38.730 --> 37:42.397
only so that he'll be able to continue dragging
them to shore by the lip in perpetuity.

37:42.501 --> 37:48.140
But causing a fish discomfiture and causing it
to become extinct are two very different things.

37:48.241 --> 37:50.678
And when talking about
the Pacific salmon...

37:50.777 --> 37:53.009
this is a species that
goes back to the Ice Age.

37:53.114 --> 37:55.084
One that is born on a river...

37:55.182 --> 37:57.483
migrates up to
2, OOO miles in the sea...

37:57.586 --> 38:00.991
then returns to the vey place
of birth to spawn...

38:01.089 --> 38:03.754
against enormous, miraculous odds...

38:03.859 --> 38:08.324
bringing nutrients on its journey
to sustain the bald eagles...

38:08.431 --> 38:12.566
the grizzly bears, the wolves,
even the rain forests themselves.

38:12.670 --> 38:16.236
An entire coastal ecosystem
depends on them.

38:16.341 --> 38:19.507
If Charlotte the Spider
were still alive today...

38:19.611 --> 38:22.277
she'd be writing in her web,
"Some fish. "

38:22.381 --> 38:25.217
Yes, well, forgive me,
but I find it insulting...

38:25.317 --> 38:27.788
to be lectured by an American
on the environment.

38:27.887 --> 38:31.452
Watch it. We're a superpower.
Don't make us add you to the Axis.

38:31.558 --> 38:34.463
Being from the United States,
I have an expertise on the issue.

38:34.562 --> 38:36.464
- Do you?
- Yes.

38:36.564 --> 38:40.266
Remember, we're the county that's practically
wiped the grizzly bear of four maps.

38:40.369 --> 38:44.970
We got rid of bull trout. To see a Florida
panther, you have to go to a hockey game.

38:45.074 --> 38:48.479
We seek to count hatchery salmon
as wild so the numbers go up...

38:48.578 --> 38:51.949
and we can take the actual wild salmon
off the endangered species list.

38:52.048 --> 38:56.889
Almost a hundred different bird and animal
species have gone extinct in the last 30 years...

38:56.987 --> 39:00.427
while our national policy remains,
"thatâ€™s not a priority. "

39:00.525 --> 39:05.127
I know all about economic interests
trumping the environment.

39:05.231 --> 39:10.504
And, truthfully, if we were talking
about the Virgin Island screech owl...

39:10.604 --> 39:12.973
or the Fresno kangaroo,
I might not care.

39:13.073 --> 39:18.176
But this is the Pacific salmon.
The sea lice are killing them.

39:18.279 --> 39:22.242
Once they're gone, Judge,
my God, they're gone.

39:26.989 --> 39:29.961
Oh, yes. Mindful that abroad...

39:30.060 --> 39:33.761
people tend to expect shock and awe
when Yankees arrive on the scene...

39:33.864 --> 39:37.862
we shall leave you with two
small but lasting words:

39:37.969 --> 39:40.338
Denny Crane, eh?

40:04.500 --> 40:07.837
- Next week?
- Well, assuming she passes the psychiatric test...

40:07.937 --> 40:10.534
and is deemed competent for trial.

40:10.641 --> 40:13.204
How can you get to
a murder trial in a week?

40:13.310 --> 40:16.306
Well, there are no facts in dispute.
It comes down to justification only.

40:16.414 --> 40:18.247
Paul, we can't let
this case drag on.

40:18.349 --> 40:20.650
The more it lives
the more our reputation' n is-

40:20.753 --> 40:23.316
Shirley, we cannot compromise
the woman's defense...

40:23.422 --> 40:25.415
just as quickly
sweep it under the carpet.

40:25.524 --> 40:27.586
We persuaded her to confess,
for God's sake.

40:27.694 --> 40:29.630
Now youâ€™re worried
about compromising her?

40:29.729 --> 40:31.757
I t was in her best interest
to come forward.

40:31.865 --> 40:34.233
Oh, right. I forgot.

40:42.277 --> 40:45.113
We look better than we smell.

41:00.165 --> 41:03.399
Shirley looked at us kind of funny.

41:03.502 --> 41:06.029
Do you think she knows
that we slept together?

41:06.138 --> 41:08.803
She might. You still have that glow.

41:11.578 --> 41:15.109
- Quite a trip.
- I shot my first steelhead.

41:18.586 --> 41:21.319
Thank you, Denny.

41:21.422 --> 41:23.655
You took my mind off Tara.

41:25.761 --> 41:27.664
Took me to a new land.

41:27.764 --> 41:32.673
- Most offal, took me to a new place.
- What do you mean?

41:32.770 --> 41:38.612
You've occasioned
a cynical, material...

41:38.710 --> 41:43.175
urban man to feel passion
for a fish.

41:43.282 --> 41:46.083
Mom.

41:48.121 --> 41:51.093
- I think Canada liked us.
- How could they not?

42:01.002 --> 42:05.102
- I think we make quite a team, I can tell you that.
- Yes, we do.

42:09.178 --> 42:12.242
We're good on the road.

42:13.784 --> 42:15.948
Indeed.

42:55.399 --> 42:57.028
You stinker!
