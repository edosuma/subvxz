WEBVTT

00:00.001 --> 00:04.136
<i> Previously on</i> Reign...
My father cut off
my mother's head.

00:04.138 --> 00:05.471
My sister jailed me

00:05.473 --> 00:07.539
as a threat to her rule.

00:07.541 --> 00:09.708
Lord Castleroy.
Greer, get back!

00:09.710 --> 00:11.710
You have been named by another
suspect in the attempted
murder of King Francis.

00:11.712 --> 00:14.246
He's in prison.
He'll never be free again.

00:14.248 --> 00:16.415
We have crippling
military debts.

00:16.417 --> 00:18.250
France is in debt
to her soldiers

00:18.252 --> 00:19.752
who fought on Scotland's behalf.

00:19.754 --> 00:22.187
Your own father
executed 13 knights

00:22.189 --> 00:23.589
on the trumped-up
charge of heresy.

00:23.591 --> 00:25.057
<i> Simply because</i>
<i> you couldn't pay them.</i>

00:25.059 --> 00:26.325
CATHERINE:
<i> I am under attack</i>

00:26.327 --> 00:27.726
<i> by a rogue group</i>
<i> calling themselves</i>

00:27.728 --> 00:29.261
<i> the Red Knights.</i>

00:29.263 --> 00:31.196
I'm going to ask
the Vatican for funds

00:31.198 --> 00:32.765
to wage war against John Knox.

00:32.767 --> 00:35.601
He is trying to take my country.

00:36.570 --> 00:39.605
(bell tolling, crows cawing)

00:45.546 --> 00:47.312
(exhales)

00:47.314 --> 00:48.414
Mother?

00:48.416 --> 00:51.150
Wait, there's been a mistake!

00:51.152 --> 00:53.052
Release the prisoner!

00:53.054 --> 00:55.254
By my order,
Anne Boleyn shall be pardoned!

00:55.256 --> 00:56.522
Free her at once!

00:56.524 --> 00:58.223
I said, release the prisoner!

00:58.225 --> 01:00.392
By order of the queen!

01:00.394 --> 01:01.427
Can no one hear me?!

01:01.429 --> 01:03.195
I order this to stop!

01:03.197 --> 01:04.596
Let her go! Mother!

01:05.366 --> 01:07.433
Mother! No.
(panting)

01:10.838 --> 01:13.605
Highness, it's all right.

01:13.607 --> 01:14.807
It's just that dream again.

01:14.809 --> 01:17.342
No one heard me, did they?

01:17.344 --> 01:18.677
SERVANT:
No, Your Highness.

01:18.679 --> 01:19.678
Rest easy.

01:28.722 --> 01:30.622
General Gaghan,
I'm sorry to tell you

01:30.624 --> 01:32.491
the threat is very grave.

01:32.493 --> 01:34.226
That is why I traded
the English ambassador

01:34.228 --> 01:35.494
for your release.

01:35.496 --> 01:37.396
A small
but ruthless group

01:37.398 --> 01:39.798
of anarchists have been staging
attacks against the Crown.

01:39.800 --> 01:41.300
And until we know more,

01:41.302 --> 01:43.802
we need the French army
to secure the throne.

01:43.804 --> 01:45.304
Well, as soon as
my soldiers are fully paid

01:45.306 --> 01:47.172
for their service in Scotland,

01:47.174 --> 01:49.408
I'm sure they will join me
and the other generals

01:49.410 --> 01:51.477
in putting down any threat.
Which will be soon.

01:51.479 --> 01:53.679
They will receive
partial payment right away.

01:53.681 --> 01:55.414
In the interim...

01:55.416 --> 01:58.383
Majesty, there can be
no interim or partial payment.

01:58.385 --> 02:00.352
I was godfather
to Francis

02:00.354 --> 02:04.156
and would give my life freely,
but my soldiers...

02:04.158 --> 02:06.391
Will desert
if they are not paid.

02:06.393 --> 02:07.392
I understand.

02:07.394 --> 02:09.761
How about this?

02:09.763 --> 02:11.263
We show the generals
and their men

02:11.265 --> 02:13.799
how deeply we value
their service

02:13.801 --> 02:16.201
by holding a feast
in their honor.

02:16.203 --> 02:18.137
Majesty,
you're very kind,

02:18.139 --> 02:20.372
but know that
a wealthy Greek prince

02:20.374 --> 02:23.275
is coming to France
in two weeks to raise an army--

02:23.277 --> 02:25.444
with gold in hand.

02:27.781 --> 02:31.283
Meaning our men will desert
and join him as mercenaries.

02:31.285 --> 02:33.285
Then tell your generals

02:33.287 --> 02:36.155
they will receive
the money their men are owed,

02:36.157 --> 02:38.524
at the feast,
in two weeks' time.

02:38.526 --> 02:39.925
The generals will be
very pleased.

02:41.195 --> 02:42.694
General Gaghan.
Majesty.

02:42.696 --> 02:44.463
Good to see you.

02:47.935 --> 02:49.434
I heard what you said.

02:49.436 --> 02:50.836
Why didn't you tell him

02:50.838 --> 02:52.304
those anarchists
are the Red Knights?

02:52.306 --> 02:53.605
And remind him we killed

02:53.607 --> 02:55.474
the last group of soldiers
we couldn't pay?

02:55.476 --> 02:57.509
No.

02:59.446 --> 03:02.481
First we pay the army,
then we crush the Red Knights.

03:02.483 --> 03:03.782
But we don't
have the money.

03:03.784 --> 03:05.350
We will.

03:05.352 --> 03:08.453
If you look hard enough,
there is always an answer.

03:09.924 --> 03:13.492
What do you mean,
the answer is no?

03:13.494 --> 03:16.428
France needs the Vatican's help,
as you well know.

03:16.430 --> 03:18.530
You're punishing me, aren't you?

03:18.532 --> 03:20.465
Not at all.
You're angry

03:20.467 --> 03:22.601
that we traded Gideon Blackburn

03:22.603 --> 03:25.504
to Elizabeth for
a vital French general.

03:25.506 --> 03:28.473
Rome simply doesn't have
the resources to help France.

03:28.475 --> 03:29.808
Nonsense.

03:29.810 --> 03:32.411
You wanted the English
ambassador killed

03:32.413 --> 03:34.346
because he foiled
your plot

03:34.348 --> 03:36.715
to put a Catholic king
on England's throne

03:36.717 --> 03:39.351
in place of the queen
standing before you.

03:39.353 --> 03:40.552
That was never our goal.

03:40.554 --> 03:41.954
Mary, you've
always been

03:41.956 --> 03:43.555
the true Queen of
Scotland and England

03:43.557 --> 03:44.790
in the eyes of Rome.

03:44.792 --> 03:46.525
Now, if only Rome could give me

03:46.527 --> 03:47.726
a few less words
of encouragement

03:47.728 --> 03:49.328
and a few more soldiers,

03:49.330 --> 03:51.430
I might actually be able
to take my country back

03:51.432 --> 03:53.899
from rebels like
the Protestant John Knox.

03:53.901 --> 03:55.801
Our forces are
now in Turkey,

03:55.803 --> 03:58.503
contesting the Holy Land.

03:58.505 --> 04:02.407
But we can help you buy an army.

04:02.409 --> 04:05.244
Would 100,000 livres
meet your needs?

04:05.246 --> 04:07.346
Thank you.

04:07.348 --> 04:09.414
That would be
quite useful.

04:10.818 --> 04:14.553
Meanwhile, the king of France
is left to do what?

04:14.555 --> 04:16.755
Light a candle,
pray for manna from heaven?

04:18.692 --> 04:20.926
Catherine, I'm
more than happy

04:20.928 --> 04:23.895
to share the Vatican's gold
if France needs it.

04:23.897 --> 04:25.530
After what
you did for Gideon,

04:25.532 --> 04:27.599
I can't help
but feel responsible...
Thank you,

04:27.601 --> 04:30.402
but I didn't trade Gideon
for General Gaghan

04:30.404 --> 04:31.703
out of the goodness
of my heart.

04:31.705 --> 04:33.405
Gentlemen, please.

04:33.407 --> 04:35.774
I need my very best
military men around me.

04:35.776 --> 04:37.409
And they cost
a lot more

04:37.411 --> 04:39.411
than the mercenaries
that you will require.

04:39.413 --> 04:40.846
Speaking of
your friend,

04:40.848 --> 04:43.715
the English ambassador,
have you heard from him?

04:43.717 --> 04:45.284
No.

04:45.286 --> 04:46.952
He was planning
to go to his sister's

04:46.954 --> 04:48.920
to find a secure place
for his daughter.

04:48.922 --> 04:52.291
From there, he's probably
going to report to Elizabeth.

04:52.293 --> 04:55.560
Where she should thank him for
saving her life and her rule.

04:55.562 --> 04:58.030
Which you will need
to do for yourself,

04:58.032 --> 05:00.699
by returning home,
to Scotland.

05:02.002 --> 05:04.036
What will it be like
when I return?

05:04.038 --> 05:05.537
Cold.

05:05.539 --> 05:08.507
Cold like you've never known.

05:08.509 --> 05:12.611
Which is why...
you will need these.

05:12.613 --> 05:14.479
Oh, this is too much.

05:14.481 --> 05:17.382
A whole new winter wardrobe
must have cost a fortune!

05:17.384 --> 05:19.518
Oh, hardly. Try it on.

05:21.488 --> 05:25.057
Have you tried using your Medici
connections yet for funds?

05:25.059 --> 05:27.626
Perhaps, um...

05:27.628 --> 05:30.662
you recall a certain
look-a-like cousin

05:30.664 --> 05:32.331
of mine?

05:32.333 --> 05:33.865
MARY:
The one who hanged herself

05:33.867 --> 05:36.702
after her lover had that...
sexual mishap?

05:36.704 --> 05:38.503
Uh, that would be the one.

05:38.505 --> 05:40.605
I wouldn't have thought
she'd be missed, but as luck

05:40.607 --> 05:42.007
would have it,
she turned out to be

05:42.009 --> 05:43.475
a favorite of my Uncle Alfonso,

05:43.477 --> 05:45.344
keeper of
the Medici purse strings.

05:45.346 --> 05:47.646
Mm, so he cut you off.

05:47.648 --> 05:49.448
I'm sorry.
Things could be worse.

05:49.450 --> 05:51.483
Better to have your
purse strings cut

05:51.485 --> 05:52.484
than your...

05:52.486 --> 05:54.519
How do I look?

05:54.521 --> 05:56.388
Like a queen men would die for.

05:57.558 --> 05:59.124
Thank you.

05:59.126 --> 06:01.360
I only wish I knew
where to look for such men.

06:01.362 --> 06:02.627
Why don't you ask Bash?

06:02.629 --> 06:04.029
He recruits
the very best

06:04.031 --> 06:05.797
mercenaries for the kingsguard.

06:05.799 --> 06:08.900
I hope I have enough gold
to buy what I need.

06:08.902 --> 06:10.635
Yes, you have
enough gold.

06:10.637 --> 06:11.937
Just.

06:11.939 --> 06:13.872
Your timing is lucky.

06:13.874 --> 06:16.375
I know of a small private army
that's just come back from

06:16.377 --> 06:18.443
some fighting near Spain.
What do you know of them?

06:18.445 --> 06:20.946
They're deadly, they're brave
and they're looking for work.

06:20.948 --> 06:22.748
Well, we must ride out to
meet them as soon as possible.

06:22.750 --> 06:24.449
Mary, they're mercenaries.

06:24.451 --> 06:26.651
I am done leading
from a distance, Bash.

06:26.653 --> 06:28.954
I want to be where my people
can see me, from now on.

06:28.956 --> 06:31.656
Well, mercenaries are usually

06:31.658 --> 06:33.892
more moved by gold
than politics,

06:33.894 --> 06:36.628
but I suppose it can't hurt.

06:38.499 --> 06:40.432
We also
might want to

06:40.434 --> 06:43.435
consider... other incentives.

06:43.437 --> 06:44.603
You mean whores.

06:44.605 --> 06:46.805
Yes, I've already
thought of that.

06:46.807 --> 06:48.440
I've written to Greer,
repeatedly,

06:48.442 --> 06:50.108
to ask if I could
hire some of hers.

06:50.110 --> 06:51.910
Repeatedly?

06:51.912 --> 06:53.745
She hasn't responded yet.

06:53.747 --> 06:56.581
To this,
or my last several letters.

06:56.583 --> 06:58.483
Nor has she appeared
at court lately.

06:59.686 --> 07:01.753
Things have been
somewhat awkward

07:01.755 --> 07:03.755
since she told me
she'd rather stay in France

07:03.757 --> 07:06.825
than come to Scotland with me.

07:11.532 --> 07:13.532
Half a million livres
in two weeks?

07:13.534 --> 07:15.834
And no help from the Vatican
or from the Medicis?

07:15.836 --> 07:19.538
Half a million, or our soldiers
desert us for Greece.

07:19.540 --> 07:21.573
Well, I can see only one option.

07:21.575 --> 07:24.109
But what I'm proposing
might be a little...

07:24.111 --> 07:26.178
unseemly for a young king
to authorize

07:26.180 --> 07:27.779
so early in his reign.

07:27.781 --> 07:29.581
Then he won't
authorize it.

07:29.583 --> 07:31.850
You'll do whatever it is
and tell us after.

07:31.852 --> 07:33.218
Mother, really,
I don't like the sound of that.

07:33.220 --> 07:34.553
Can you get us the money?

07:34.555 --> 07:36.087
I believe I can.

07:36.089 --> 07:39.124
Then do it, whatever it is,
as soon as possible.

07:44.698 --> 07:45.931
(knocking at door)

07:45.933 --> 07:47.199
I hope that's my food, Mimi.

07:47.201 --> 07:49.468
I'm famished.

07:49.470 --> 07:51.536
Your girl said I could
bring this up for you.

07:51.538 --> 07:53.738
She said you haven't left
your room in weeks.

07:53.740 --> 07:56.107
Greer, I've been so
worried about you.

08:05.219 --> 08:07.486
Why didn't you tell me?

08:08.989 --> 08:11.056
¶ ¶

08:15.496 --> 08:16.828
I thought I could do it.

08:16.830 --> 08:18.830
I thought,
with my sister's help,

08:18.832 --> 08:21.500
I could keep my secret

08:21.502 --> 08:23.969
and give my baby a decent home
at the same time.

08:23.971 --> 08:25.570
But I was a fool.

08:25.572 --> 08:27.706
Don't say that, Greer.

08:27.708 --> 08:29.808
You are going to be
a wonderful mother.

08:29.810 --> 08:31.276
And you have enough
money put aside

08:31.277 --> 08:32.743
for a comfortable
life, don't you?

08:32.746 --> 08:34.045
Comfortable isn't enough.

08:34.047 --> 08:36.281
I want my baby to grow up
with a good name.

08:36.283 --> 08:37.816
I'll help you change your name,

08:37.818 --> 08:39.284
get you papers
of recommendation.

08:39.286 --> 08:40.919
Can you get me a husband, too?

08:40.921 --> 08:42.554
Someone to be a father
to this child?

08:42.556 --> 08:44.756
Mary, you know the world
we live in.

08:44.758 --> 08:47.025
I also know that you
already have a husband.

08:47.027 --> 08:48.927
Lord Castleroy is a good man,

08:48.929 --> 08:50.529
and now,
with Catherine as regent,

08:50.531 --> 08:52.564
I may be able to have him
released from prison.

08:52.566 --> 08:55.901
Aloysius was the best thing
to ever happen to me.

08:55.903 --> 08:57.168
But how can I ask him

08:57.170 --> 08:58.937
to be a father
to another man's child?

08:58.939 --> 09:01.606
And how can I ask you
to help release him,

09:01.608 --> 09:03.141
when the conspiracy
he unwittingly funded

09:03.143 --> 09:05.944
was responsible for your...

09:05.946 --> 09:09.080
My rape.

09:09.082 --> 09:10.982
You can say it.

09:10.984 --> 09:13.051
I couldn't put you through
those memories again.

09:13.053 --> 09:15.120
Those memories are
a part of me, Greer,

09:15.122 --> 09:18.123
but I am stronger than they are.

09:18.125 --> 09:20.725
My life is once again
the sum of<i> my</i> choices,

09:20.727 --> 09:22.594
not someone else's crimes.

09:22.596 --> 09:25.697
And I choose to help my friend.

09:27.668 --> 09:29.935
CHARLES:<i> I don't understand</i>
<i> why we have to</i>

09:29.937 --> 09:31.636
take time to visit the generals.

09:31.638 --> 09:34.773
A king must always deliver
good news in person.

09:34.775 --> 09:36.808
Bad news should be sent
via messenger,

09:36.810 --> 09:38.810
or let them find out
on their own.

09:38.812 --> 09:41.012
But, Mother, can we even be
certain we have good news?

09:41.014 --> 09:42.681
Narcisse wasn't sure
he could get the money

09:42.683 --> 09:44.249
in whatever unseemly way

09:44.251 --> 09:45.984
he had in mind...
(crowd shouting angrily)

09:45.986 --> 09:47.752
What is that racket?
WOMAN: It's them!

09:47.754 --> 09:49.287
It's the royals!
It's the royals!

09:49.289 --> 09:51.790
You, royals! Hey!

09:51.792 --> 09:53.725
Here's all the tithe
you'll get from me!

09:53.727 --> 09:55.660
GUARD:
Stand clear!

09:55.662 --> 09:56.661
Back to the castle at once!

09:56.663 --> 09:59.598
(crowd continues shouting)

10:01.101 --> 10:03.835
Narcisse. He must have
tithed the peasants.

10:03.837 --> 10:06.004
What?
It's a kind of emergency tax.

10:06.006 --> 10:07.706
I know what a tithe is.

10:07.708 --> 10:09.040
They've been tithed
once already this year.

10:09.042 --> 10:10.342
No wonder they're angry.

10:10.344 --> 10:12.010
They can't afford
to pay any more.

10:13.680 --> 10:16.281
ELIZABETH:
<i> We're marking 50 years</i>

10:16.283 --> 10:18.149
since the coronation
of King Henry VIII.

10:18.151 --> 10:20.118
Is the Jubilee the biggest
event of every year?

10:20.120 --> 10:23.121
Yes. We all must demonstrate
our admiration

10:23.123 --> 10:24.956
for the greatest king
Englishmen can remember.

10:24.958 --> 10:26.224
Although, this year,

10:26.226 --> 10:27.993
it might prove to be
quite interesting.

10:27.995 --> 10:31.296
Lady Beatrice Somerset
promised to attend.

10:31.298 --> 10:35.700
What do you know of my mother,
Anne Boleyn?

10:35.702 --> 10:39.304
I know she was so admired
by King Henry

10:39.306 --> 10:42.774
that he cast aside his first
wife to make her his queen.

10:42.776 --> 10:45.677
He thought Anne
would give him a son.

10:45.679 --> 10:49.147
When she<i> only</i> gave him me,

10:49.149 --> 10:51.182
he had no more use for her.

10:51.184 --> 10:52.817
Or her head.

10:52.819 --> 10:54.386
Do you have any memories of her?

10:54.388 --> 10:55.820
Not really.

10:55.822 --> 10:57.756
I was two when she died.

10:57.758 --> 11:00.692
And all I've heard since
are the outlandish rumors

11:00.694 --> 11:04.129
my father trumped up
to justify her execution.

11:04.131 --> 11:06.164
They smeared
her with every

11:06.166 --> 11:08.266
dirty accusation
they could think of:

11:08.268 --> 11:11.703
adultery, treason, witchcraft.

11:11.705 --> 11:13.271
Even incest.

11:13.273 --> 11:14.973
That was the
worst charge.

11:14.975 --> 11:18.843
And it came from
my mother's best friend,

11:18.845 --> 11:20.779
Lady Beatrice Somerset.

11:20.781 --> 11:21.846
(door opens)

11:23.750 --> 11:25.950
Please, stay.

11:25.952 --> 11:28.353
Sir Robert is just
saying good-bye.

11:28.355 --> 11:30.188
But I would happily
abandon my trip north

11:30.190 --> 11:31.923
to stay by your side
for the Jubilee.

11:31.925 --> 11:33.258
Yes, but your duties

11:33.260 --> 11:35.727
as the Earl of Leicester
cannot wait.

11:35.729 --> 11:37.429
Oh, the sheep census?

11:37.431 --> 11:39.464
My Queen,

11:39.466 --> 11:40.932
since foiling the Vatican's
plot against you,

11:40.934 --> 11:42.834
I have new favor
amongst the nobles.

11:42.836 --> 11:44.903
There's no need
to hide our friendship.

11:44.905 --> 11:46.838
I'm afraid there still is.

11:46.840 --> 11:49.007
This Jubilee must
remind England

11:49.009 --> 11:52.977
that I am the great
King Henry VIII's daughter.

11:52.979 --> 11:55.246
Not Robert Dudley's mistress.

11:56.283 --> 11:58.016
Right.

11:58.018 --> 12:01.886
Just promise me that someday
I'll hold you again.

12:01.888 --> 12:03.788
That's all I ask.

12:03.790 --> 12:07.125
Someday. Yes, of course.

12:07.127 --> 12:09.861
I long for that, too.

12:09.863 --> 12:11.730
Even if it takes years.

12:11.732 --> 12:12.964
Years?

12:17.738 --> 12:21.139
I don't know where you found
the strength to send him away.

12:21.141 --> 12:23.975
This Jubilee is a burden
he could help you carry.

12:23.977 --> 12:27.112
Actually, it's your help I need.

12:28.315 --> 12:30.815
Your help to get revenge
on Lady Somerset.

12:30.817 --> 12:32.150
Me?

12:32.152 --> 12:34.052
Can't you just
have her seized

12:34.054 --> 12:35.954
by your guards
when she arrives?

12:35.956 --> 12:38.957
With my mother's blood staining
the hands of so many nobles,

12:38.959 --> 12:42.327
I risk losing my throne
if I so much as mention

12:42.329 --> 12:45.497
my mother's name,
let alone try and avenge her.

12:45.499 --> 12:48.433
I must smile in the
face of her butchers.

12:48.435 --> 12:51.302
Always my father's daughter.

12:51.304 --> 12:53.338
That is why Lady Somerset

12:53.340 --> 12:56.441
thinks she's safe
coming to my court,

12:56.443 --> 12:59.144
even though she is
the liar who testified

12:59.146 --> 13:01.346
that my mother slept
with her own brother.

13:01.348 --> 13:03.915
And my father
rewarded her lies

13:03.917 --> 13:06.251
by giving her
my mother's family lands.

13:06.253 --> 13:09.154
But what is it
you're asking me to do?

13:10.857 --> 13:13.858
Plant a stolen necklace
on Somerset.

13:13.860 --> 13:15.927
It will allow me

13:15.928 --> 13:17.995
to fine her so I can get
my mother's lands back.

13:20.167 --> 13:23.334
We were hounded by a mob
of filth-hurling peasants!

13:23.336 --> 13:26.104
All thanks
to your brilliant tithe.

13:26.106 --> 13:27.972
My sincere apologies.

13:27.974 --> 13:29.274
I had no idea you
intended to ride out.

13:29.276 --> 13:31.042
Had I known, I
would've warned you.

13:31.044 --> 13:34.546
I know how you like to stay
indoors during tax season.

13:34.548 --> 13:37.015
Well, at least
the money was raised.

13:37.017 --> 13:38.183
Oh.

13:38.185 --> 13:40.552
The money<i> was</i> raised,
Stephan?

13:40.554 --> 13:42.387
Well, with the
peasants revolting,

13:42.389 --> 13:45.190
we would need the military
to enforce collection.

13:45.192 --> 13:48.359
And we can't ask the military
to do that until we pay them.

13:48.361 --> 13:50.061
Oh, dear Lord.

13:50.063 --> 13:51.296
Well, what now?

13:51.298 --> 13:52.997
You said if you look
hard enough,

13:52.999 --> 13:54.566
there's always an answer.

13:54.568 --> 13:57.368
Well, the last answer I could
think of was trusting him.

13:58.572 --> 14:01.005
I'm sorry. I need to think.

14:01.007 --> 14:02.340
(Narcisse sighs)

14:02.342 --> 14:04.909
Majesty, don't lose hope.

14:04.911 --> 14:06.044
She's right, you know.

14:06.046 --> 14:07.512
There is always an answer.

14:07.514 --> 14:08.446
To begin with,

14:08.448 --> 14:10.215
we'll have to travel tonight.

14:10.217 --> 14:13.051
Of course, Majesty,
but leave the castle

14:13.053 --> 14:15.086
with the peasants revolting?

14:15.088 --> 14:17.989
Pack for a day's travel,
and pack warmly.

14:17.991 --> 14:20.992
It's especially cold
in the foothills of the Alps.

14:20.994 --> 14:22.594
The Alps?

14:31.938 --> 14:33.571
You're asking for almost all
the gold the Vatican lent me.

14:33.573 --> 14:35.106
How am I to pay
for supplies?

14:35.108 --> 14:36.374
Food, weapons?

14:36.376 --> 14:39.344
With my men behind you,
your loyalists will rally.

14:39.346 --> 14:41.312
And the food and supplies
will follow.

14:41.314 --> 14:43.147
But I would be taking
an enormous risk.

14:43.149 --> 14:46.251
We are talking about war,
aren't we?

14:46.253 --> 14:49.020
Will you take
a risk for me, then?

14:49.022 --> 14:51.222
To prove what
you're capable of?

14:51.224 --> 14:52.891
What risk?

14:52.893 --> 14:55.493
Not far from here is the
Oubliette of Roussillon.

14:55.495 --> 14:58.263
Lord Aloysius Castleroy
is imprisoned there.

14:58.265 --> 15:00.598
Free him, and you
have the job.

15:00.600 --> 15:02.634
Including all the gold
you've asked for.

15:02.636 --> 15:04.302
It's a royal prison,
is it not?

15:04.304 --> 15:06.004
For the force of
your skill and size,

15:06.006 --> 15:07.005
it should be easy enough.

15:07.007 --> 15:09.941
You drive a clever bargain.

15:09.943 --> 15:12.043
We'll return with

15:12.044 --> 15:14.144
this Lord Castleroy
by nightfall.

15:15.949 --> 15:18.049
You told me you wanted
to help Greer.

15:18.051 --> 15:19.317
You didn't say it was

15:19.319 --> 15:20.985
by breaking her husband
out of prison.

15:20.987 --> 15:22.687
Does Catherine
know about this?

15:22.689 --> 15:25.123
Catherine asked not to know.

15:25.125 --> 15:27.325
Because helping Castleroy
would inflame her relations

15:27.327 --> 15:29.127
with the Catholic nobles.

15:29.129 --> 15:31.195
In other words,
she'll look the other way.

15:32.966 --> 15:35.166
But how is Castleroy supposed
to get by once he's free?

15:35.168 --> 15:37.001
I will get him false documents.

15:37.003 --> 15:39.671
So no one will know
of his record as an insurgent.

15:39.673 --> 15:41.606
You've thought of everything.

15:43.176 --> 15:44.442
Now, tell me the plan again,

15:44.444 --> 15:46.177
so I know it's fixed
in your mind.

15:46.179 --> 15:47.545
Yes, when the
nobles line up

15:47.547 --> 15:49.514
to be presented with favors,

15:49.516 --> 15:51.549
I'll slip those pearls
into Lady Somerset's bag

15:51.551 --> 15:53.151
for the guards to find.

15:53.153 --> 15:54.986
And you've seen
her portrait,

15:54.988 --> 15:57.021
so you know
who you're looking for?

15:57.023 --> 15:58.423
And I know
what she'll be wearing.

16:06.099 --> 16:08.566
Once you've had her arrested

16:08.568 --> 16:12.270
and fined her to get
your family's property back,

16:12.272 --> 16:14.105
will you show her mercy?

16:14.107 --> 16:15.974
Like the mercy
she showed my mother?

16:20.146 --> 16:23.014
(crickets chirping)

16:24.284 --> 16:26.317
Bash, where are they?

16:26.319 --> 16:29.020
Bonnay said they'd be
back by nightfall.

16:29.022 --> 16:31.723
Maybe Castleroy
has been killed.

16:31.725 --> 16:33.458
Maybe the men I need
to take back Scotland

16:33.460 --> 16:36.060
have already died
trying to rescue him.

16:36.062 --> 16:38.496
Bonnay's men know
what they're doing.

16:38.498 --> 16:40.064
And so do you.

16:40.066 --> 16:41.299
So much is
about to change.

16:41.301 --> 16:42.767
No matter what happens
with Castleroy,

16:42.769 --> 16:45.303
Greer will probably
have to leave French court

16:45.305 --> 16:47.739
to distance herself
from her reputation.

16:47.741 --> 16:49.340
And you'll be leaving
soon as well.

16:49.342 --> 16:50.441
For Scotland.

16:50.443 --> 16:52.343
It seems unimaginable.

16:52.345 --> 16:53.511
But yes.

16:53.513 --> 16:56.014
We did it before, you and I.

16:56.016 --> 16:58.116
Remember,
when we ran away?

16:58.118 --> 16:59.484
Of course.

16:59.486 --> 17:00.718
How could I forget?

17:00.720 --> 17:03.154
We were so desperate
to avert the prophecy.

17:03.156 --> 17:06.024
We would have done
anything to save Francis.

17:06.026 --> 17:08.493
They were
complicated times.

17:08.495 --> 17:12.063
I'll go tend the fire.

17:17.804 --> 17:20.104
(lively chatter)

17:20.106 --> 17:21.606
(cheering)

17:27.514 --> 17:29.781
Remember,
don't stare.

17:29.783 --> 17:31.315
This casino is the
one place in Europe

17:31.317 --> 17:32.717
a king can feel
like a commoner.

17:32.719 --> 17:33.785
Ah.

17:33.787 --> 17:36.554
Knucklebones
played with rubies.

17:36.556 --> 17:37.688
That's a new one,
even for me.

17:37.690 --> 17:39.290
It was my favorite
game last summer.

17:39.292 --> 17:40.691
Charles!

17:40.693 --> 17:42.460
My young prince
is back.

17:42.462 --> 17:44.695
But wait, I should
say my young king.

17:44.697 --> 17:47.498
Countess Van Court,
always a pleasure.

17:47.500 --> 17:49.300
I was hoping the deeds

17:49.302 --> 17:50.835
to the royal vineyards
in Burgundy

17:50.837 --> 17:53.371
would do
for our entrance stake.

17:58.845 --> 18:00.311
Of course.

18:00.313 --> 18:01.779
Knucklebones again?

18:01.781 --> 18:03.648
You know me too well.
Hmm.

18:06.219 --> 18:08.453
If you lose these vineyards,
every man in France

18:08.455 --> 18:09.587
will riot in the street.

18:09.589 --> 18:11.289
Then I'll be sure to win.

18:14.828 --> 18:16.828
(horses neighing)

18:17.864 --> 18:20.465
Mary, come quickly!

18:22.769 --> 18:24.102
Your man.

18:24.104 --> 18:25.336
Or what's left of him.

18:25.338 --> 18:26.337
MARY:
Good Lord.

18:26.339 --> 18:27.839
Castleroy,
is that you?

18:27.841 --> 18:29.774
Bash, take him
to the carriage.

18:29.776 --> 18:31.742
He is to see
a physician immediately.

18:31.744 --> 18:34.579
BONNAY:
Ride hard, Majesty.

18:34.581 --> 18:35.847
Or he might not make it.

18:37.817 --> 18:40.151
(lively chatter)

18:40.153 --> 18:41.552
¶ ¶

18:53.833 --> 18:55.600
(crowd quiets)

18:59.139 --> 19:02.440
To the greatest king
and the greatest father

19:02.442 --> 19:06.277
England and the world
has ever known--

19:06.279 --> 19:08.412
King Henry the VIII.

19:08.414 --> 19:10.915
ALL:
King Henry the VIII!

19:10.917 --> 19:13.284
I would like to present

19:13.286 --> 19:16.787
my most loyal
and patient courtiers

19:16.789 --> 19:21.225
with a golden favor in honor
of this 50th Jubilee.

19:21.227 --> 19:22.860
100 favors shall be awarded
to those first in line

19:22.862 --> 19:24.762
to meet with Her Highness.

19:24.764 --> 19:26.831
Any seeking a private
audience must submit

19:26.833 --> 19:28.399
to a brief search
by the Royal Guard.

19:28.401 --> 19:30.268
Come along now,
remain orderly.

19:38.545 --> 19:41.379
(gasps)

19:41.381 --> 19:43.781
Did you just try to steal
this woman's pearls?

19:43.783 --> 19:45.449
No, of course not...
Then explain why

19:45.451 --> 19:47.451
they're coming from her bag,
attached to your hand.

19:47.453 --> 19:48.953
Oh, what a lovely necklace.

19:48.955 --> 19:50.655
Where did you get it?

19:50.657 --> 19:52.957
The queen's
stolen pearls.

19:52.959 --> 19:54.792
(court gasping, murmuring)

19:57.330 --> 19:59.363
Arrest them both.

20:00.967 --> 20:02.400
But I-I...

20:11.611 --> 20:13.277
So you say a man
at the Jubilee

20:13.279 --> 20:15.613
paid you to hide the
pearls in my bag?

20:15.615 --> 20:18.216
I thought it was some
secret code between you,

20:18.218 --> 20:19.850
that perhaps
you were lovers.

20:19.852 --> 20:21.819
I had no idea the pearls
belonged to the queen.

20:21.821 --> 20:23.321
But it makes no sense.

20:23.323 --> 20:24.789
Whoever gave them to you,

20:24.791 --> 20:26.457
Elizabeth must've
convinced them to do it.

20:26.459 --> 20:27.992
And as a lady

20:27.994 --> 20:31.529
to the queen of Scots, you were
nothing but a pawn in this.

20:31.531 --> 20:33.431
You poor fool.

20:35.001 --> 20:37.368
But what would Elizabeth
have against you?

20:37.370 --> 20:40.004
I should never have accepted
the invitation to the Jubilee.

20:40.006 --> 20:44.375
I should've known Elizabeth
would be laying in wait for me.

20:44.377 --> 20:46.010
You don't know how
often I've wished

20:46.012 --> 20:47.445
I could speak
with the queen

20:47.447 --> 20:49.513
to explain about Anne.

20:49.515 --> 20:50.915
Explain what?

20:50.917 --> 20:53.651
I am Lady Beatrice Somerset.

20:53.653 --> 20:55.286
You must've heard
all the stories.

20:55.288 --> 20:57.388
The lady who sold out
her dearest friend

20:57.390 --> 20:58.990
and her infant daughter.

20:58.992 --> 21:00.658
Yes.

21:00.660 --> 21:03.361
You told
those outlandish tales--

21:03.363 --> 21:06.731
Anne was guilty of witchcraft
and other depravities.

21:06.733 --> 21:09.033
Everyone knew
Henry wanted her gone.

21:09.035 --> 21:11.936
To speak ill of Anne was
to curry favor with the king.

21:11.938 --> 21:14.372
And that's what you did.

21:14.374 --> 21:15.439
It wasn't my idea.

21:17.277 --> 21:18.943
A chambermaid of Anne's
claimed to have seen

21:18.945 --> 21:21.879
Anne and her brother George...

21:21.881 --> 21:23.047
together.

21:23.049 --> 21:25.416
Wait, a chambermaid said this?

21:25.418 --> 21:26.884
Anne's night maid.

21:26.886 --> 21:28.319
But he knew

21:28.320 --> 21:29.753
that no one would believe it
unless it came

21:29.756 --> 21:31.756
from someone like me,
a close friend to Anne.

21:31.758 --> 21:33.291
And so he turned

21:33.293 --> 21:35.059
the screws on my family.

21:35.061 --> 21:36.727
Threats...

21:36.729 --> 21:38.996
and promises.

21:38.998 --> 21:41.032
After the trial,
Henry awarded me

21:41.034 --> 21:42.767
the Boleyn family lands.

21:42.769 --> 21:45.503
And Henry knew the chambermaid's
story was a lie.

21:45.505 --> 21:46.671
Of course he did.

21:46.673 --> 21:48.673
The only thing Anne

21:48.675 --> 21:50.541
was ever guilty of
was not having a son.

21:53.813 --> 21:56.380
(footsteps approaching)

22:03.523 --> 22:05.056
You're Nancy, correct?

22:05.058 --> 22:07.491
Yes, I am, Your Highness.

22:07.493 --> 22:08.559
(door closes)

22:08.561 --> 22:10.494
The night maid.

22:10.496 --> 22:12.596
The one who said
she saw Queen Anne

22:12.598 --> 22:14.665
lay with her own
brother George.

22:14.667 --> 22:17.868
Please, Highness,
don't make me speak of that.

22:17.870 --> 22:20.004
Why?

22:20.006 --> 22:22.006
Was it too
painful for you

22:22.008 --> 22:26.677
to condemn an innocent woman
to death with your lies?

22:26.679 --> 22:28.713
You don't understand,
Highness.

22:28.715 --> 22:30.881
Why you sent my mother
to the headsman?

22:30.883 --> 22:33.884
No, I understand that.

22:33.886 --> 22:37.688
How often does a chambermaid
get to bring down a queen?

22:37.690 --> 22:39.724
Did my mother
mistreat you?

22:39.726 --> 22:42.727
Or was it Henry's flattery,
his cajoling?

22:42.729 --> 22:44.862
It wasn't a lie, Highness.

22:44.864 --> 22:46.464
(gasps)

22:47.567 --> 22:50.067
I wish it was a lie.

22:50.069 --> 22:52.403
The truth is much worse.

22:52.405 --> 22:54.071
What?

22:54.073 --> 22:56.006
I never blamed your mother.

22:56.008 --> 22:58.075
She had no choice.

22:58.077 --> 22:59.977
What are you saying?

22:59.979 --> 23:01.712
Your father was so cruel to her.

23:01.714 --> 23:03.647
Cruel to you, too.

23:03.649 --> 23:05.516
"I just need

23:05.518 --> 23:07.151
a son," Anne would say.

23:07.153 --> 23:09.120
"Then he'll treat Lizzy right."

23:09.122 --> 23:12.857
She was desperate
and afraid for both of you.

23:12.859 --> 23:14.492
That's why she did it.

23:14.494 --> 23:15.826
I saw them

23:15.828 --> 23:17.428
with my own eyes.

23:17.430 --> 23:19.864
She didn't want
an affair--

23:19.866 --> 23:20.965
just the baby.

23:20.967 --> 23:22.533
She couldn't
trust any man

23:22.535 --> 23:24.135
but your uncle to help her.

23:24.137 --> 23:27.538
I was in the closet cot
on night duty.

23:27.540 --> 23:28.739
I never meant to spy,

23:28.741 --> 23:30.875
but the door latch was broken,

23:30.877 --> 23:32.777
and it wouldn't stay shut.

23:32.779 --> 23:35.079
They couldn't
go through with it though.

23:35.081 --> 23:37.081
Anne was crying too hard.

23:37.083 --> 23:38.182
You're lying.

23:38.184 --> 23:39.750
Tell me you're lying.

23:42.622 --> 23:44.755
They tortured me two days

23:44.757 --> 23:46.590
before I told.

23:46.592 --> 23:48.526
Someone else saw George

23:48.528 --> 23:50.161
leave Anne's room.

23:50.163 --> 23:51.762
Henry knew I'd been
on night duty,

23:51.764 --> 23:53.731
and if anything happened
in Anne's chambers,

23:53.733 --> 23:54.932
I might know it.

23:54.934 --> 23:56.600
(gasps softly)

23:56.602 --> 23:58.169
And he was right.

23:58.171 --> 23:59.937
Oh, my God.

23:59.939 --> 24:03.808
I told Henry they'd stopped,
but he didn't care.

24:03.810 --> 24:05.776
(sighs)

24:05.778 --> 24:09.447
He made Anne's friend
tell the story he wanted.

24:09.449 --> 24:10.848
Don't blame
your poor mother

24:10.850 --> 24:13.784
for what she did.

24:13.786 --> 24:17.521
She's in heaven now,
if any soul is.

24:19.959 --> 24:21.559
(lively chatter)

24:21.561 --> 24:22.993
(laughs)

24:24.530 --> 24:26.797
Fortune is smiling on you, sir.

24:26.799 --> 24:29.934
That is half what we owe
the armies in under an hour.

24:29.936 --> 24:31.969
Well done.

24:31.971 --> 24:33.504
I can double it
with one roll.

24:33.506 --> 24:34.905
We'll have all we need.

24:36.008 --> 24:37.541
Shouldn't you bag
some of your winnings,

24:37.543 --> 24:38.909
take it slowly?

24:38.911 --> 24:41.812
It's a game of chance,
and I'm on a streak.

24:41.814 --> 24:43.948
Just as easily lose it all
as little at a time.

24:45.852 --> 24:48.619
I've gotten us this
far, haven't I?

24:52.692 --> 24:53.958
All in.

24:53.960 --> 24:55.259
(crowd murmuring)

25:06.906 --> 25:09.507
MAN: Sorry, sir.
The house wins.

25:09.509 --> 25:11.876
All wagers go to the house.

25:15.281 --> 25:17.681
Too bad.

25:17.683 --> 25:20.251
Fortune smiled, then she turned
another direction.

25:20.253 --> 25:22.753
So sad you'll have to go,
my little king.

25:22.755 --> 25:23.821
NARCISSE:
We're not going anywhere.

25:23.823 --> 25:24.889
Not until you give us

25:24.891 --> 25:27.157
a chance to win back
what we've lost.

25:27.159 --> 25:29.159
It seems your luck
has run out, sir.

25:29.161 --> 25:30.761
The same as your stake.

25:30.763 --> 25:34.265
I'm not talking
about games of chance.

25:34.267 --> 25:37.234
There is always another game
in a place like this.

25:38.938 --> 25:40.137
Where is it?

25:40.139 --> 25:42.306
We have a sort of...

25:42.308 --> 25:44.008
arena fighting downstairs.

25:44.010 --> 25:44.975
Not for the squeamish.

25:44.977 --> 25:46.310
But you...

25:46.312 --> 25:49.880
you have everything you need
to place a bet.

25:49.882 --> 25:51.949
We're not interested.
Oh, it's a pity.

25:51.951 --> 25:53.317
Another match
was just about to begin.

25:53.319 --> 25:55.252
With the right wager,
you could win

25:55.254 --> 25:58.956
four times what you lost with
that last throw of the bones.

25:58.958 --> 26:00.024
We're in.

26:03.763 --> 26:04.895
Very good.

26:04.897 --> 26:07.064
(crowd cheering)

26:08.200 --> 26:11.235
(laughs)

26:11.237 --> 26:14.939
My champion tore through all
the challengers for tonight.

26:14.941 --> 26:17.775
Yet the crowd wants more.

26:17.777 --> 26:20.010
I'll give you 10,000 livres
to wager on your own life

26:20.012 --> 26:22.012
if you'll take him on.

26:22.014 --> 26:23.213
Very well.

26:23.215 --> 26:25.149
You have a deal.

26:27.253 --> 26:28.586
No, Narcisse.

26:28.588 --> 26:30.087
You heard the countess.

26:30.089 --> 26:31.989
The champion
is undefeated.

26:31.991 --> 26:33.057
Take a closer look.

26:33.059 --> 26:36.193
See how he holds
his dominant shoulder?

26:36.195 --> 26:37.261
He's hurting.

26:37.263 --> 26:39.863
That is why he is half-drunk.

26:41.133 --> 26:42.967
Your life is too
valuable for this.

26:42.969 --> 26:46.070
No one life is more valuable
than France.

26:53.012 --> 26:54.311
VAN COURT:
Place your bets!

26:54.313 --> 26:57.615
We have a new challenger
for our house champion.

26:57.617 --> 26:59.049
Fighters to your marks.

27:01.687 --> 27:03.020
Begin!

27:03.022 --> 27:04.722
(crowd cheering)

27:04.724 --> 27:06.023
(grunting)

27:12.832 --> 27:14.298
(groaning)

27:17.003 --> 27:18.836
(crowd cheering)

27:18.838 --> 27:20.404
Come on, Narcisse. Get up.

27:20.406 --> 27:21.205
(laughs)

27:25.711 --> 27:27.778
(groaning)

27:29.048 --> 27:30.114
(groaning)

27:32.752 --> 27:34.084
(yells)

27:42.261 --> 27:43.127
(shouts)

27:44.330 --> 27:47.398
(groaning)

27:47.400 --> 27:49.033
(gurgles)

27:49.035 --> 27:51.001
(crowd cheering)

27:54.040 --> 27:56.106
(panting)

27:57.209 --> 27:59.910
10,000 livres at
50-to-one odds.

27:59.912 --> 28:01.779
You did it.

28:01.781 --> 28:04.181
All the money we need
to pay off the army.

28:04.183 --> 28:07.785
How does it feel being
the savior of France?

28:07.787 --> 28:09.086
Better than being him.

28:19.131 --> 28:20.097
Leave us.

28:22.735 --> 28:25.102
You might have told me
about the three nights in jail

28:25.104 --> 28:26.704
before I agreed to your plan.

28:26.706 --> 28:29.106
And you might not
have fumbled the pearls,

28:29.108 --> 28:31.709
and I wouldn't have had
to spend the last three days

28:31.711 --> 28:34.211
convincing my privy council
to let me pardon you.

28:36.148 --> 28:37.981
And Beatrice Somerset?

28:37.983 --> 28:40.050
Where was she
dragged off to last night?

28:40.052 --> 28:41.852
She offered to return
my family's lands,

28:41.854 --> 28:43.454
and I accepted.

28:43.456 --> 28:45.856
She leaves today
with my forgiveness.

28:45.858 --> 28:47.858
Your forgiveness?

28:47.860 --> 28:50.928
What? But she confessed to lying
about your mother.

28:50.930 --> 28:52.229
I-I don't understand.

28:53.899 --> 28:57.301
I never forgave my father
for what he did to my mother.

28:58.938 --> 29:01.071
But at the same time,
I never forgot

29:01.073 --> 29:04.141
his brutal effectiveness
as a ruler.

29:04.143 --> 29:06.944
And then I learned things,
ways in which

29:06.946 --> 29:08.746
he destroyed people's lives

29:08.748 --> 29:11.115
that I could never understand
or imagine.

29:11.117 --> 29:13.150
Now I know
how I must rule.

29:13.152 --> 29:14.151
I must always be seen

29:14.153 --> 29:16.153
as Henry's daughter.

29:17.123 --> 29:19.156
But in my heart,

29:19.158 --> 29:21.325
I can be something
so much different.

29:21.327 --> 29:24.027
Your mother.

29:24.029 --> 29:26.864
She was not perfect.

29:26.866 --> 29:30.100
But the mistakes she made,

29:30.102 --> 29:33.203
she made out of love.

29:33.205 --> 29:37.040
Love for me,
even love for Henry.

29:37.042 --> 29:41.111
Does this mean you might allow
Robert Dudley to come home?

29:41.113 --> 29:44.148
Nothing has changed
between Robert and I.

29:44.150 --> 29:45.883
We can never marry,

29:45.885 --> 29:47.818
and therefore he brings nothing
to my life.

29:47.820 --> 29:49.353
Does he not make you happy?

29:50.823 --> 29:54.091
Elizabeth, do you love him?

29:55.194 --> 29:56.260
Yes.

29:56.262 --> 29:57.795
Are you sure?

29:58.798 --> 30:01.999
Love is a risk for anyone.

30:02.001 --> 30:05.202
But for you, knowing what love
did to your mother,

30:05.204 --> 30:07.037
how could you not fear it?

30:07.039 --> 30:09.039
Has it occurred to you

30:09.041 --> 30:11.542
that perhaps your heart
chose Robert Dudley--

30:11.544 --> 30:13.544
a married man-- for a reason?

30:13.546 --> 30:16.380
You think the obstacle
of Dudley's marriage

30:16.382 --> 30:18.182
was his main attraction?

30:18.184 --> 30:20.050
Isn't it possible?

30:20.052 --> 30:24.188
Because now that he's free,
well, I don't see you

30:24.190 --> 30:25.389
fighting for him.

30:25.391 --> 30:28.158
Are you saying
I never really loved him?

30:28.160 --> 30:29.560
No, I'm saying

30:29.562 --> 30:33.163
that there may be
a greater love for you

30:33.165 --> 30:35.332
in the future, once
you're open to it.

30:35.334 --> 30:37.334
To him, whoever he may be.

30:37.336 --> 30:41.839
I'm beginning to see
why Mary chose you as her lady

30:41.841 --> 30:43.240
and as her friend.

30:43.242 --> 30:45.108
You are brave,

30:45.110 --> 30:47.211
perhaps wise...

30:47.213 --> 30:49.012
and definitely loyal.

30:49.014 --> 30:50.547
Uh, loyal?

30:52.218 --> 30:54.184
My guards told me

30:54.186 --> 30:57.321
you never revealed my part
in our plan to Somerset.

30:58.257 --> 31:00.357
(sighs)

31:02.027 --> 31:03.293
She never would have
told the truth

31:03.295 --> 31:05.329
had you told her our secret.

31:05.331 --> 31:06.930
I owe you my thanks.

31:10.269 --> 31:12.269
(gasps)

31:12.271 --> 31:14.371
John!

31:15.274 --> 31:17.107
My precious boy!

31:17.109 --> 31:18.475
Look at you walking!

31:18.477 --> 31:20.344
My love!

31:20.346 --> 31:22.379
Oh!

31:22.381 --> 31:24.348
Oh, I missed you.

31:26.185 --> 31:28.252
Oh, have you come
to punish me

31:28.254 --> 31:30.387
for letting Charles
sneak out of the castle

31:30.389 --> 31:31.989
on such a
dangerous mission?

31:31.991 --> 31:34.992
He told me all about it.

31:34.994 --> 31:36.226
(sighs)

31:36.228 --> 31:38.629
You risked your life
to save my son.

31:38.631 --> 31:39.630
And France.

31:39.632 --> 31:41.365
I want to say
that if you were

31:41.367 --> 31:44.134
foolish enough
to fight a gladiator,

31:44.136 --> 31:47.304
I'm hoping you are foolish
enough to back a hated regent

31:47.306 --> 31:48.972
in turbulent times.

31:48.974 --> 31:50.374
I want you

31:50.376 --> 31:52.042
as my lord chancellor.

31:52.044 --> 31:53.911
Are you serious?

31:53.913 --> 31:55.512
Are you going to make me
ask twice?

31:55.514 --> 31:57.414
No, I...

31:57.416 --> 32:01.318
I am just the fool
you're looking for.

32:02.388 --> 32:05.522
France needs you,
so get better soon.

32:09.094 --> 32:11.161
¶ ¶

32:21.407 --> 32:23.340
Seems like we're both
much changed

32:23.342 --> 32:25.175
since the last time
we saw each other.

32:25.177 --> 32:27.144
Oh, Aloysius, I'm so sorry.

32:27.146 --> 32:28.412
¶ The burning inside... ¶

32:28.414 --> 32:31.114
I think we had best
just get on with this.

32:31.116 --> 32:33.417
¶ Starts to let go ¶

32:34.486 --> 32:38.956
¶ Turns into smoke... ¶

32:38.958 --> 32:40.490
Mary said you wanted to speak

32:40.492 --> 32:44.161
before you made
any decisions about us.

32:44.163 --> 32:46.496
I'm sorry
it happened this way,

32:46.498 --> 32:48.632
but the fact remains,
I'm having this child.

32:48.634 --> 32:51.368
I would like to give it
the best life I can.

32:51.370 --> 32:53.737
I want my child
to have a proper home--

32:53.739 --> 32:55.739
a loving home--

32:55.741 --> 32:57.307
and a good father.

32:57.309 --> 32:58.976
¶ Everyone knows it... ¶

32:58.978 --> 33:02.245
I would like my child
to have you.

33:03.582 --> 33:05.649
¶ The hope that you have ¶

33:05.651 --> 33:08.352
¶ The dream that we were... ¶

33:08.354 --> 33:10.420
Thank you
for allowing me to see you

33:10.422 --> 33:12.055
before I made any decision.

33:12.057 --> 33:14.391
Now I know
my answer.

33:14.393 --> 33:16.493
I'm sorry. I can't help you.

33:16.495 --> 33:20.330
But, Aloysius,
without you, I'm all alone.

33:20.332 --> 33:23.600
I could give birth any day,
and I have nowhere else to turn.

33:23.602 --> 33:26.103
I'm sorry. I simply can't.

33:26.105 --> 33:28.772
¶ A reason to live or to die ¶

33:28.774 --> 33:32.109
¶ Won't you come home ¶

33:32.111 --> 33:36.213
¶ Back to where
your heart is... ¶

33:36.215 --> 33:38.048
Lord Castleroy.

33:38.050 --> 33:40.150
I know I can't imagine

33:40.152 --> 33:41.685
what prison must do
to one's soul.

33:41.687 --> 33:43.120
But I do know this:

33:43.122 --> 33:45.489
the love you felt for Greer,

33:45.491 --> 33:47.157
a love like that
doesn't just disappear.

33:47.159 --> 33:49.159
Not completely.

33:49.161 --> 33:51.361
There is always
an ember remaining.

33:51.363 --> 33:53.397
Look deep in your heart
for that ember,

33:53.399 --> 33:54.398
I beg you.

33:54.400 --> 33:56.500
For her sake and yours.

33:56.502 --> 33:58.402
¶ Won't you come home... ¶

33:58.404 --> 34:00.437
(knocking at door)

34:00.439 --> 34:02.506
¶ Won't you come home ¶

34:06.378 --> 34:09.479
¶ There once was a girl ¶

34:09.481 --> 34:11.081
¶ Who's now just a ghost... ¶

34:11.083 --> 34:13.316
I'm sorry for
my behavior just now.

34:13.318 --> 34:14.818
You deserve better.

34:14.820 --> 34:17.387
That's quite all right.
I understand.

34:17.389 --> 34:20.524
¶ And everyone knows it... ¶

34:20.526 --> 34:22.159
No, you don't.

34:22.161 --> 34:24.094
No one does.

34:24.096 --> 34:25.462
Coming back to normal life--

34:25.464 --> 34:27.431
the food, the freedom,
the sunlight--

34:27.433 --> 34:29.666
it's all...
it's all overwhelming.

34:29.668 --> 34:33.103
I feel like I'm...
I'm different.

34:33.105 --> 34:35.405
Aloysius, I'm different, too.

34:36.375 --> 34:38.542
Do you think you could try

34:38.544 --> 34:40.577
to start over with me?

34:40.579 --> 34:42.712
To get back
to where we once were?

34:42.714 --> 34:44.081
¶ Back to where
your heart is... ¶

34:44.083 --> 34:46.216
I know it will take time, but...

34:46.218 --> 34:47.317
Get back to what?

34:48.420 --> 34:51.121
Was I ever what you wanted?
Really?

34:51.123 --> 34:53.657
Yes. Aloysius, I fell
in love with you.

34:53.659 --> 34:56.193
I know you've always
doubted it, but it's true.

34:56.195 --> 34:57.527
¶ Not the fight... ¶

34:57.529 --> 34:58.595
(sighs)

34:58.597 --> 35:01.231
Your... courage,

35:01.233 --> 35:02.566
your cleverness,

35:02.568 --> 35:04.434
your kindness.

35:06.171 --> 35:07.838
And that hasn't changed.

35:07.840 --> 35:09.539
¶ Won't you come home? ¶

35:11.310 --> 35:14.277
¶ Won't you come home? ¶

35:20.452 --> 35:23.353
These will allow you
to establish a new life

35:23.355 --> 35:24.788
anywhere in France.

35:24.790 --> 35:26.790
Do you know where
you'll settle yet

35:26.792 --> 35:28.558
or how you'll get by?

35:28.560 --> 35:29.793
We're heading south.

35:29.795 --> 35:31.795
Somewhere warm
and bright.

35:31.797 --> 35:34.664
¶ Then you make it light... ¶

35:34.666 --> 35:37.701
I've saved enough for
Aloysius and I to start over.

35:39.171 --> 35:41.171
¶ Then you make it right... ¶

35:41.173 --> 35:43.540
What odd turns our
lives have taken.

35:43.542 --> 35:46.409
Mary, I can't believe
this is good-bye.

35:46.411 --> 35:50.213
With Lola in England, you're
the last of my ladies, Greer.

35:50.215 --> 35:52.149
What will I do without you?

35:52.151 --> 35:54.718
We came here to help you
find your way at court.

35:54.720 --> 35:57.587
You found your way
a long time ago.

35:57.589 --> 35:59.189
It was always more than that.

35:59.191 --> 36:01.191
We're oldest
and dearest friends.

36:01.193 --> 36:03.493
And it breaks my heart
to say it, but...

36:03.495 --> 36:05.328
friends grow up.

36:05.330 --> 36:06.763
And sometimes grow apart,

36:06.765 --> 36:08.632
far from each other.

36:08.634 --> 36:10.700
But I'll never forget
what you've done for me.

36:10.702 --> 36:12.269
For us.

36:12.271 --> 36:14.704
¶ Because of mine... ¶

36:14.706 --> 36:17.574
You're going to be so happy.

36:17.576 --> 36:18.475
¶ Feel my fear... ¶

36:18.477 --> 36:20.644
(laughs)

36:20.646 --> 36:24.714
¶ And yours align ¶

36:24.716 --> 36:26.483
¶ Feel our fear... ¶

36:26.485 --> 36:27.617
It's time.

36:27.619 --> 36:29.186
Lord Castleroy
shouldn't linger.

36:29.188 --> 36:31.788
¶ Fall behind ¶

36:31.790 --> 36:35.592
¶ Baby, I get dark ¶

36:36.895 --> 36:40.197
¶ And then you make it light ¶

36:40.199 --> 36:41.798
¶ When I break my heart ¶

36:41.800 --> 36:43.733
(horse whinnies)

36:44.836 --> 36:46.803
¶ Then you make it right ¶

36:46.805 --> 36:49.372
(sobbing)

36:49.374 --> 36:50.807
¶ Baby, there's an art... ¶

36:50.809 --> 36:52.909
I lose everyone I love.

36:52.911 --> 36:55.712
¶ To how you live your life... ¶

36:55.714 --> 36:57.380
Not everyone.

36:57.382 --> 37:00.217
¶ Baby, I get dark... ¶

37:00.219 --> 37:02.619
Oh, you're right, Bash.

37:02.621 --> 37:04.387
I've made so many
friends here.

37:04.389 --> 37:06.223
Especially you.
(sniffles)

37:06.225 --> 37:08.758
Mary, don't be upset
by what I'm going to tell you.

37:08.760 --> 37:10.994
I don't mean to add to your
burdens, only lighten them.

37:10.996 --> 37:12.929
Of course. What is it?

37:12.931 --> 37:14.898
You're going
to Scotland soon.

37:14.900 --> 37:16.733
You're going to face
terrible dangers there.

37:16.735 --> 37:18.402
You're not going
to know at first

37:18.403 --> 37:20.070
who your friends
or your enemies are.

37:20.071 --> 37:21.738
You're going to need someone
close who can protect you.

37:21.740 --> 37:23.673
Someone whose love for you
cannot be questioned.

37:23.675 --> 37:24.908
Bash...

37:24.910 --> 37:26.977
I'm going to Scotland with you.

37:26.979 --> 37:28.712
No, I can't let you do that.

37:28.714 --> 37:30.747
I'm not asking for
anything in return.

37:30.749 --> 37:34.017
I know that you have to marry
a prince or a king.

37:34.019 --> 37:35.418
But what you said
to Castleroy,

37:35.420 --> 37:38.555
the embers that burn
in your heart...

37:38.557 --> 37:40.790
and they never go cold,
not completely.

37:40.792 --> 37:43.360
I know, because, trust me,
I've tried to douse mine.

37:43.362 --> 37:44.594
But I'm done trying.

37:44.596 --> 37:46.563
Those embers, they keep me warm.

37:46.565 --> 37:49.799
And they will, as long as
I'm lucky enough to serve you.

37:49.801 --> 37:52.869
¶ Baby, when I'm dark ¶

37:52.871 --> 37:57.307
¶ You always make it light. ¶

37:58.910 --> 38:02.479
Honored generals,
the Valois are pleased

38:02.481 --> 38:04.547
to present you with
payment of all wages

38:04.549 --> 38:07.951
due to the brave soldiers
who served in Scotland.

38:07.953 --> 38:09.686
CATHERINE: Today's threats
come from anarchists;

38:09.688 --> 38:12.706
tomorrow's may
come from abroad.

38:12.707 --> 38:15.725
But with you in our service,
France shall feel no fear.

38:15.727 --> 38:18.928
We pledge our lives
to the defense of your crown,

38:18.930 --> 38:21.965
your reign and your realm.

38:21.967 --> 38:24.000
Long live King Charles.

38:24.002 --> 38:26.036
And a long life to all those
who stand before me.

38:26.038 --> 38:28.038
GENERALS:
Long live King Charles.

38:28.040 --> 38:31.441
Now, please, bring out more wine
and enjoy this feast.

38:32.411 --> 38:33.677
Majesty, a tribute

38:33.679 --> 38:35.045
was just delivered
to your chambers.

38:35.047 --> 38:36.479
The messenger
suggested

38:36.481 --> 38:38.415
it was to be worn
at the banquet.

38:38.417 --> 38:40.650
Was it from Mary, perhaps?

38:40.652 --> 38:43.320
Or Narcisse?

38:43.322 --> 38:44.754
Charles,

38:44.756 --> 38:46.489
don't stop
with the toasts.

38:46.491 --> 38:47.991
I'll be just a moment.

38:58.070 --> 39:00.570
"History repeats itself."

39:05.077 --> 39:07.077
The Red Knights mask.

39:07.079 --> 39:09.646
No.

39:09.648 --> 39:11.648
No, no, no.

39:11.650 --> 39:13.850
Charles.

39:13.852 --> 39:15.952
Oh, please.

39:15.954 --> 39:18.355
Not Charles, please.

39:20.659 --> 39:22.892
(gasps)

39:31.370 --> 39:33.937
Darling.

39:33.939 --> 39:37.374
Let go. He's dead.

39:37.376 --> 39:38.875
He's gone.
I don't understand.

39:38.877 --> 39:40.143
He's been poisoned.

39:40.145 --> 39:42.145
I don't understand.

39:43.115 --> 39:45.014
(gasps)

39:45.016 --> 39:46.383
Did you do this?

39:46.385 --> 39:47.817
This was the Red Knights.

39:47.819 --> 39:51.087
They just left their calling
card in my chambers.

39:51.089 --> 39:53.390
I drank the same wine they did.

39:59.631 --> 40:01.131
That means the glasses
were poisoned.

40:02.501 --> 40:04.434
All but ours.

40:05.570 --> 40:07.137
Which means that they are
inside the castle,

40:07.139 --> 40:09.973
able to pick and choose
who they will kill.

40:09.975 --> 40:11.541
But why spare us?

40:13.412 --> 40:15.645
They want the world
to think that we did this--

40:15.647 --> 40:18.515
killed the generals
to get out of paying them.

40:18.517 --> 40:21.151
Murdered them,
like the knights before them.

40:21.153 --> 40:24.053
And the world will believe it,
as history repeats itself.

40:24.055 --> 40:25.588
But we had the money.

40:25.590 --> 40:27.157
We were repaying them.
Don't you see?

40:27.159 --> 40:28.892
Everyone who knows that is dead.

40:30.195 --> 40:31.828
And when word of this gets out,

40:31.830 --> 40:34.164
the army will rise up
with the people,

40:34.166 --> 40:36.065
and we will burn.
