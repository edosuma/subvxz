00:32.430 --> 00:36.672
There's only one room you got
to worry about, but it's a goddamn mess.

00:37.470 --> 00:40.473
Guy blew his brains out
all over the walls.

00:40.573 --> 00:42.988
That shouldn't be a problem.

01:37.797 --> 01:40.139
You gonna keep that?

01:41.367 --> 01:44.573
I'll hold on to it
if you're just gonna throw it away.

02:32.484 --> 02:33.859
Ballard.

02:53.101 --> 02:56.469
Okay. Okay, thank you.

03:06.051 --> 03:07.811
Special Agent Terrence Ballard.

03:10.395 --> 03:12.392
Okay.

03:12.492 --> 03:14.995
Agent Ballard,
let's just sit tight a minute.

03:15.895 --> 03:19.155
Why don't you just tell your lieutenant
that FBI is here?

03:22.467 --> 03:25.872
Lieutenant... could you come out here
for a minute?

03:28.774 --> 03:31.077
- Yeah. Is there a problem here?
- No, there's no problem.

03:31.177 --> 03:35.448
Just seems that Officer... What is it?
Meyer and I are having a little disagreement.

03:35.548 --> 03:38.885
- Great. He's clear to come in.
- Thank you.

03:39.752 --> 03:43.704
- Cup of coffee before we get started?
- No. I don't drink coffee.

03:45.224 --> 03:48.562
Make sure you cover your feet, too.
It's pretty messy in there.

03:49.662 --> 03:50.764
Tell me about the woman.

03:51.898 --> 03:53.833
Her name was Ellie Ford, 28.

03:53.933 --> 03:57.504
DMV records say she moved here
from Houston three years ago.

03:57.904 --> 03:59.205
Checked her phone?

03:59.305 --> 04:03.843
Her cell's missing, but we know
she kept her 713 Houston area code.

04:03.943 --> 04:07.421
- And?
- We're pulling the records now.

04:09.115 --> 04:10.884
Who found her?

04:10.984 --> 04:13.823
Building manager...
found her early this morning.

04:17.723 --> 04:21.187
I read your report
on when they found Judas last week.

04:21.286 --> 04:23.006
It was good.

04:24.163 --> 04:25.328
Yeah, well...

04:25.428 --> 04:28.879
since you were in town, it made sense
to get your opinion on this one.

04:30.804 --> 04:32.806
What are the similarities?

04:33.106 --> 04:34.969
The wrists and ankles bound with wire,

04:35.069 --> 04:37.808
marks and bruising
from struggle and resisting,

04:37.908 --> 04:39.949
ultimately killed by decapitation...

04:40.646 --> 04:43.479
Everything matches the Judas M.O.
except for a couple of things.

04:44.383 --> 04:46.309
What things?

04:50.155 --> 04:53.373
I think it's best
you take a look for yourself.

04:56.062 --> 04:59.715
If you're in here, who's watching
the front, Officer Meyer?

05:05.338 --> 05:06.305
Agent Ballard.

05:06.405 --> 05:09.542
I can have forensics
give you copies of photos.

05:09.642 --> 05:12.579
I prefer to take my own. Thanks.

05:13.179 --> 05:14.912
Excuse me.

05:25.424 --> 05:27.527
Where's her head?

05:27.627 --> 05:28.853
That's the first difference.

05:30.667 --> 05:34.702
We think he took it with him, but we're still
sweeping the area, just in case.

05:36.202 --> 05:39.066
That's a pretty big difference.

05:40.973 --> 05:43.308
And that is an interesting touch.

06:25.863 --> 06:26.836
Morning.

06:26.936 --> 06:30.857
- Good morning. You're home late.
- Yeah. It was a shitty night.

06:30.957 --> 06:31.958
Yeah?

06:32.058 --> 06:35.762
Yeah, the last call was a homicide.
I got stuck guarding the crime scene.

06:35.862 --> 06:38.031
Oh, that sucks.

06:38.704 --> 06:41.267
- You're getting started pretty early.
- Busy day.

06:41.367 --> 06:43.369
I got a job booked,
and I'm taking Mom to N.A.

06:43.469 --> 06:46.606
I just want to get a little more done.

06:46.706 --> 06:48.387
- And I'll make us some breakfast.
- Okay.

06:48.787 --> 06:51.311
So, what was the crime scene
like... messy?

06:51.811 --> 06:54.614
Oh, yeah, it was pretty messy.

06:55.114 --> 06:58.718
And, plus, they brought in this...
dick from the FBI.

06:59.018 --> 07:01.888
It's pretty weird
to bring in the FBI, right?

07:01.988 --> 07:05.516
I guess he was already down here working
on that dead serial-killer thing.

07:05.616 --> 07:08.428
But, of course, he walked in
like he owned the place.

07:08.528 --> 07:12.131
- What? Want me to beat him up for you?
- Would you?

07:12.231 --> 07:14.205
- Yeah.
- I feel really weak compared to him.

07:14.305 --> 07:17.069
- Really?
- He's... he's pretty big for a short guy.

07:17.169 --> 07:19.739
No, it was embarrassing. I mean, they didn't
even tell me they were gonna bring him in,

07:19.839 --> 07:22.375
which made me look like an idiot.

07:22.675 --> 07:25.612
- They already book a cleaner?
- Oh, no, probably not.

07:25.712 --> 07:28.062
Put in a good word for me?

07:28.648 --> 07:32.051
- Yeah, I'll put in a word for you.
- Why, thank you.

07:32.151 --> 07:34.208
No problem.

07:37.689 --> 07:39.144
- Babe?
- Yeah?

07:41.527 --> 07:46.032
- You think you're overbooking yourself?
- Well, I got to work, right?

07:46.232 --> 07:49.035
Yeah, of course, but, I mean,
you've been working a lot lately.

07:49.135 --> 07:51.857
Well, I got my mom to take care of.

07:52.838 --> 07:54.685
Honey, she's holding you back.

07:56.041 --> 07:57.708
What's that supposed to mean?

07:58.844 --> 08:01.654
Look... look, she takes your time.
She takes your money.

08:01.754 --> 08:03.414
She's my mother, Daniel.

08:06.351 --> 08:08.287
You know, I'm gonna go to work.
I'm late, anyway.

08:08.387 --> 08:10.923
Well, wait. Wait a minute.
What about breakfast?

08:11.023 --> 08:15.817
June, wait. I'm sorry. Look, I'm not trying
to make you mad here, okay? I'm...

08:18.965 --> 08:20.894
You've got...

08:21.957 --> 08:25.872
such a great opportunity with your work here,
and I just don't want to see you lose it.

08:26.372 --> 08:28.187
I know.

08:29.108 --> 08:31.411
- I got you something.
- Daniel, you don't have to get me anything.

08:31.511 --> 08:35.726
I don't want you to think it's anything more
than a... than a... a token or something.

08:35.826 --> 08:41.955
Just... I... I saw it,
and it made me think of you.

08:42.155 --> 08:45.093
Wow, it's really... it's really pretty.

08:47.793 --> 08:50.863
- Is it too big?
- No, it's... it's fine.

08:50.963 --> 08:52.599
It's perfect.

08:53.099 --> 08:55.665
Thank you. Okay...

08:57.863 --> 09:01.252
- I got to go. I'm gonna be late.
- Okay. Yeah.

09:01.352 --> 09:03.042
- June, I love you.
- Okay.

09:21.426 --> 09:24.045
- Hey, honey.
- Hey, Mom.

09:26.732 --> 09:31.462
<i>Margaret Abbott. March 9, 1996.
Okay, we're recording.</i>

09:31.604 --> 09:36.342
<i>So, let's start with how you left
your 6-year-old daughter June in the car.</i>

09:38.311 --> 09:40.813
<i>It wasn't on purpose.</i>

09:40.913 --> 09:43.149
<i>Usually, with my dealer,
it's just real quick.</i>

09:43.249 --> 09:45.034
<i>You know, it's like in and out.</i>

09:45.134 --> 09:47.485
<i>And how long was it?</i>

09:47.585 --> 09:51.491
<i>I don't really know.
I lost track of time, I guess.</i>

09:51.591 --> 09:53.526
<i>So you were high.</i>

09:53.826 --> 09:57.690
<i>Yeah. I didn't plan to, though.
I wanted to leave her,</i>

09:57.790 --> 10:01.701
<i>but he had me do a shot with him
right there... you know how it is.</i>

10:02.001 --> 10:05.338
<i>So it could have been an hour?</i>

10:06.442 --> 10:07.406
<i>Maybe?</i>

10:07.806 --> 10:10.243
<i>Even more? Couple of hours?</i>

10:10.343 --> 10:16.015
<i>Yeah, yeah, I guess. I mean, June told
the cops that found her that she was only</i>

10:16.115 --> 10:18.217
- <i>waiting a couple of minutes.</i>
- Yes?

10:18.317 --> 10:21.858
I've got those birth certificates
and hospital records you were looking for.

10:21.958 --> 10:23.855
Thank you.

10:34.366 --> 10:37.910
<i>So she lied. Why do you think she'd lie?</i>

10:38.010 --> 10:41.290
<i>June's always looking out for me.</i>

10:58.390 --> 10:59.830
- Hey.
- Hey.

10:59.930 --> 11:01.394
How was it?

11:03.462 --> 11:07.466
Not bad. Terry relapsed,
but we saw that coming.

11:07.566 --> 11:10.368
Yeah. Mom, you got to do your belt.

11:13.305 --> 11:14.857
Okay.

11:17.576 --> 11:19.812
Since when did you start wearing a ring?

11:20.012 --> 11:22.921
Oh, it's just something that Daniel
gave me the other day.

11:23.416 --> 11:25.843
Daniel gave it to you.

11:27.486 --> 11:28.822
Why? What are you smiling about?

11:28.922 --> 11:33.256
Nothing. I just think
he is really good for you.

11:36.527 --> 11:40.497
- It's really beautiful, too.
- Yeah. It's not bad, right?

11:45.270 --> 11:47.039
- Oh, wait! No, honey!
- What?

11:47.139 --> 11:49.675
I got to go in for my test
before we go home.

11:49.775 --> 11:52.478
- Right now?
- It's for my probation.

11:52.878 --> 11:55.472
Well, Mom, how long is that gonna take?
'Cause I have a job later.

11:55.772 --> 11:58.138
You know what?
If you're too busy, then that's fine.

11:58.283 --> 12:00.419
- No, I'm not...
- Drop me off. I'll take a bus.

12:00.519 --> 12:05.563
Mom, I will take you. I just wish that you
would tell me these things ahead of time.

12:08.972 --> 12:09.927
Okay.

12:47.466 --> 12:49.775
Did you get a call
from the station today?

12:49.875 --> 12:52.406
Yeah. They said they're gonna release
the crime scene in the morning,

12:52.506 --> 12:54.742
as soon as the FBI gives the all-clear.

12:57.242 --> 13:00.812
Dan, I know you weren't trying
to start a fight this morning.

13:01.547 --> 13:03.582
- Yeah, I... it's just...
- No, no, no, no, listen. I...

13:04.515 --> 13:07.953
I really appreciate
how supportive you are.

13:17.095 --> 13:18.965
What is this song?

13:19.965 --> 13:22.434
I just... I just downloaded this today.

13:31.977 --> 13:35.614
- Good evening, Officer Meyer.
- You've got to be kidding me.

13:35.714 --> 13:37.051
June Abbott.

13:38.117 --> 13:39.985
Yes?

13:40.085 --> 13:42.083
Terrence Ballard, FBI.

13:43.489 --> 13:46.914
Oh, you're the asshole FBI guy.

13:47.626 --> 13:50.415
Yeah, that's probably me.

13:50.796 --> 13:52.298
Isn't it kind of late?

13:52.798 --> 13:56.165
I wouldn't be here
if it wasn't important.

14:04.775 --> 14:08.370
- So you're not married.
- Nope.

14:09.982 --> 14:13.152
And, June, you work
in trauma scene cleanup, right?

14:13.452 --> 14:14.789
Yes.

14:17.489 --> 14:19.725
Is that how you two met?

14:19.925 --> 14:22.562
No, we met in community college
a couple of years ago.

14:22.662 --> 14:25.739
I'm sorry. Why exactly are you here?

14:27.566 --> 14:29.602
I'm an FBI profiler.

14:29.902 --> 14:32.487
My... first case was the...

14:33.587 --> 14:35.597
Judas killer.

14:37.442 --> 14:39.581
I began that profile
over 20 years ago...

14:40.372 --> 14:42.368
when the trail went cold.

14:42.568 --> 14:44.527
Then the case is closed, right?

14:49.288 --> 14:51.274
Do you recognize this woman?

15:01.632 --> 15:05.175
No, I've never seen her before.
What's her name?

15:07.672 --> 15:12.565
Ellie Ford. I believe you're cleaning up
her crime scene tomorrow.

15:13.211 --> 15:16.504
Now, I don't know
what you've heard, but...

15:16.970 --> 15:19.000
I'm pretty sure this is the work
of a Judas copycat.

15:20.852 --> 15:24.390
- Have you been contacted by Annie Barlow?
- Annie Barlow?

15:24.590 --> 15:27.426
The woman who actually killed Judas.

15:27.526 --> 15:30.963
She's not returning any of our calls,
and I figured...

15:31.263 --> 15:32.364
I don't know.

15:32.764 --> 15:36.368
- Is she a suspect?
- No, no. I just...

15:36.468 --> 15:38.704
We need to speak to her.

15:39.252 --> 15:41.240
I'm sorry.
What does this have to do with June?

15:41.940 --> 15:46.479
- I think that June may be a target.
- Why the hell would I be a target?

15:46.879 --> 15:49.891
Well, seeing that your mother was one
of the women originally killed by Judas,

15:49.991 --> 15:51.651
that puts you at the top
of the list of women that...

15:51.751 --> 15:55.687
I'm sorry. You're mistaken.
My mother is still alive.

15:55.987 --> 15:58.493
No, I'm referring to your biological
mother, Jennifer Glick.

15:59.191 --> 16:01.627
My mother's name is Maggie Abbott.

16:02.223 --> 16:05.063
Well, not according
to your birth certificate.

16:08.467 --> 16:10.875
I'm sorry. Did you not know this?

16:17.108 --> 16:20.412
You were just at my mom's house,
weren't you?

16:20.512 --> 16:23.204
I was, yes. I'm...

16:23.304 --> 16:26.319
Well, I'm trying to talk to anybody
connected to the original case.

16:28.338 --> 16:30.323
Here.

16:30.823 --> 16:34.794
These are some personal effects
of Jennifer Glick.

16:35.559 --> 16:38.597
We had them at the FBI. We don't need them
anymore, so I figured that, well...

16:38.697 --> 16:41.425
- Thank you.
- You may want them.

16:43.369 --> 16:46.316
Now... If I could just have
a few more minutes of your time...

16:46.416 --> 16:50.015
You know what? I think that I'm...
I'm done for the night.

16:50.702 --> 16:53.514
Thank you for all this,
but can we talk some other time?

16:55.381 --> 16:57.521
Okay. Yeah, okay.

17:01.219 --> 17:03.741
You know, can I hold on to this?

17:08.159 --> 17:11.424
- Sure.
- Thank you.

17:11.762 --> 17:13.147
Good night.

17:14.266 --> 17:16.069
Good night.

17:19.369 --> 17:21.848
I'll show you out.

17:33.851 --> 17:37.922
- This June's stuff?
- Yeah. It's her work.

17:42.928 --> 17:45.885
And you work mostly nights now, right?

17:45.985 --> 17:49.802
- That's correct.
- And June... she's here all alone?

17:50.402 --> 17:52.059
You're free to leave now.

17:58.943 --> 18:02.948
So you're just assuming that she's home
in bed at 4:00 in the morning, right?

18:04.716 --> 18:07.586
If you have any
more questions for June...

18:07.686 --> 18:10.042
you can ask her yourself.

18:14.191 --> 18:17.012
- What do you want me to do with that?
- Take it.

18:17.412 --> 18:19.807
Just in case.

18:24.202 --> 18:26.236
Good night.

25:39.504 --> 25:41.240
Why didn't you tell me?

25:41.940 --> 25:43.194
I wanted to protect you.

25:43.294 --> 25:47.112
Protect me from what?
That my real mother was butchered?

25:47.512 --> 25:50.682
- She was my sister.
- She was my mother, Maggie!

25:50.782 --> 25:52.070
I had a right to know.

25:52.884 --> 25:57.023
But you lied to me my whole life. Why?

25:58.323 --> 26:00.792
So you could have someone
to take care of you?

26:01.392 --> 26:05.395
- I didn't mean for it to happen that way.
- You're pathetic.

26:10.568 --> 26:13.607
Who is my dad?

26:16.657 --> 26:19.586
- I don't know.
- This is my fucking life, Maggie!

27:25.644 --> 27:27.579
Hey, guys.

27:27.679 --> 27:30.247
I'm just gonna go ahead and get started.

29:56.259 --> 29:58.062
Come on.

29:58.630 --> 30:01.374
Come on, pick up! Pick up! Pick up!

30:02.934 --> 30:04.985
<i>Your call has been forwarded
to an automated voice...</i>

30:05.085 --> 30:06.919
Shit!

30:36.034 --> 30:38.895
And that's when you called 911?

30:41.005 --> 30:43.001
Yeah. I...

30:43.601 --> 30:46.882
I used my cellphone to make the call.

30:47.545 --> 30:51.382
Have you always had a key
to Ms. Abbott's apartment?

30:51.582 --> 30:52.883
She was my mom.

30:52.983 --> 30:55.471
Why don't you tell us about the fight
you had with your mother yesterday?

30:58.856 --> 30:59.717
Miss Abbott...

30:59.817 --> 31:02.193
He already knows
what we were fighting about.

31:02.293 --> 31:04.549
Could you tell me, please?

31:07.298 --> 31:09.830
I had just found out that my mom
wasn't my real mom,

31:09.930 --> 31:14.472
so I came over here to talk about it,
and we got into a fight.

31:14.572 --> 31:18.844
I woke up this morning, and I felt bad,
so I came over to apologize.

31:19.444 --> 31:23.681
- Neighbor said there was a lot of yelling.
- I was angry.

31:25.650 --> 31:27.517
Obviously.

31:59.649 --> 32:01.684
June?

32:08.626 --> 32:11.059
How can this happen?

32:14.832 --> 32:16.198
Honey.

32:17.335 --> 32:19.404
Carver called.
I was just on my way over.

32:21.372 --> 32:26.578
- It's my fault. It's all my fault.
- How could this possibly be your fault?

32:31.782 --> 32:34.495
I love you so much, June.

32:37.021 --> 32:39.290
I love you, too.

34:13.618 --> 34:16.120
Whoa, whoa, whoa! What?

34:17.221 --> 34:19.591
June, what happened? What's the matter?

34:55.692 --> 34:58.262
Hi. I'm looking for Annie.

34:58.362 --> 35:01.466
I'm... I'm not sure if I have
the right number.

35:01.566 --> 35:04.767
But... listen...

35:05.588 --> 35:09.040
someone's picking up
where Charles Barlow left off.

35:09.840 --> 35:14.498
And the FBI said
that I'm a target and...

35:14.857 --> 35:17.454
that you are, too.

35:17.554 --> 35:20.785
I... I just found out that my...

35:20.885 --> 35:26.456
my biological mother was murdered
by Charles Barlow when I was a baby.

35:27.441 --> 35:29.371
Anyway, if you... if you could just...

35:29.471 --> 35:33.163
if you could just call me back
on this number, that would be great.

35:33.263 --> 35:37.234
Oh... It's... it's June Abbott...
my name is June.

35:37.334 --> 35:40.404
Okay, thank you. Bye.

36:40.073 --> 36:42.544
- What you looking for?
- Oh, hey.

36:42.844 --> 36:47.899
Is your... is your old portfolio
in here... the stuff you shot in Kansas?

36:47.999 --> 36:49.783
Yeah. Why?

36:49.883 --> 36:54.904
It's just... a lot of landscapes
and stuff from my dad's funeral home.

36:55.504 --> 36:58.142
Just looking for some
reference photos for a mortuary.

36:58.242 --> 37:02.363
I just got to keep my mind busy,
and I got those pages to finish, so...

37:02.463 --> 37:04.004
You gonna be okay for tonight?

37:07.201 --> 37:10.038
- Yeah, I'll be okay.
- Okay.

37:11.038 --> 37:13.307
If there's anything you need me to do,
just let me know.

37:13.407 --> 37:15.474
Okay.

37:23.517 --> 37:25.869
Well, I should get going.

39:19.183 --> 39:20.989
No!

42:07.200 --> 42:09.599
No! No!

42:09.699 --> 42:11.796
June.

42:32.258 --> 42:34.305
June?

42:37.463 --> 42:39.498
Babe?

42:42.001 --> 42:44.424
June, are you here?

42:46.206 --> 42:48.975
- June?
- Hold on.

42:52.846 --> 42:54.691
Hi.

42:57.418 --> 42:59.338
All the lights were on. The TV was on.

42:59.438 --> 43:03.557
The living room is a...
is a mess. What where...

43:03.657 --> 43:05.139
Did you sleep in here?

43:07.461 --> 43:09.187
I don't want to talk about it.

43:10.698 --> 43:12.608
Right.

43:13.233 --> 43:14.802
- Okay.
- Okay.

43:14.902 --> 43:18.418
No, look, it's not okay, June. I was...

43:19.018 --> 43:22.281
- I was really worried about you.
- Please, stop. I just... I can't.

45:12.752 --> 45:15.620
What the hell is this?

45:39.946 --> 45:42.015
- God damn it!
- You scared the shit out of me!

45:42.115 --> 45:46.458
You realize you could get a year in county
for tampering with a crime scene, right?

45:46.987 --> 45:48.364
Are you following me?

45:50.090 --> 45:51.559
What are you doing here?

45:53.660 --> 45:56.229
I was looking for something.

45:56.797 --> 45:58.118
What are you looking for?

46:00.533 --> 46:03.571
I've cleaned up enough crime scenes to know
that people walk off with stuff sometimes.

46:03.671 --> 46:06.606
I was just making sure
that all her things were safe.

46:06.706 --> 46:08.977
How long you been
in trauma scene cleanup?

46:11.678 --> 46:14.058
A little over two years.

46:16.049 --> 46:18.752
Kind of an odd career choice,
don't you think?

46:19.252 --> 46:21.154
I could say the same thing about you.

46:21.254 --> 46:23.857
You obsess over serial killers
for a living.

46:23.957 --> 46:25.665
No.

46:25.765 --> 46:28.854
I profile them so I can stop them.

46:34.233 --> 46:36.768
Have you always been comfortable
with death?

46:38.438 --> 46:40.825
Why would you ask me that question?

46:41.408 --> 46:46.012
Because you picked a career
where you wallow in it every day?

46:46.112 --> 46:48.482
Wallow in it?

46:48.582 --> 46:52.085
You talk about it like
it's something disgusting. It's not.

46:52.185 --> 46:54.869
They're people.
There's respect in what I do.

47:03.029 --> 47:07.064
You are very interesting to me.

47:08.769 --> 47:11.821
Your artwork is interesting, too.

47:15.008 --> 47:17.294
Do I scare you?

47:19.245 --> 47:21.780
Are you gonna arrest me or what?

47:26.252 --> 47:29.082
No, I'm not gonna arrest you.

47:29.482 --> 47:32.125
Then stop following me.

47:32.225 --> 47:35.364
Why did you say
that you didn't recognize Ellie Ford?

47:37.664 --> 47:41.101
- Because I didn't.
- Yeah, you did.

47:41.201 --> 47:44.060
I could read it on your face the moment
I showed you that picture.

47:46.373 --> 47:48.163
Why would I lie to you?

47:49.442 --> 47:51.670
Same reason everybody does.

49:27.106 --> 49:28.742
Hello.

49:28.842 --> 49:31.946
- <i>Is this June Abbott?</i>
- Yes.

49:33.046 --> 49:35.228
- June, this is Annie Barlow.
- <i>Annie.</i>

49:36.128 --> 49:39.387
Hi. Yeah, hello. Shit.

49:39.487 --> 49:41.222
You got my message?

49:42.322 --> 49:45.292
You said that your mother
was killed by Charles Barlow?

49:45.692 --> 49:48.029
Yeah. Her name was Jennifer Glick.

49:48.429 --> 49:52.798
- Your mom was Jenny Glick?
- <i>Oh, you knew who she was?</i>

49:55.368 --> 49:57.737
Yeah. I mean, everyone knew who she was.

49:57.837 --> 50:02.075
<i>Well... now there have been
two more women killed the same way.</i>

50:05.512 --> 50:07.865
The FBI... they think
that we're targets,

50:07.965 --> 50:10.317
- but I wanted to...
- So what it is that you wanted from me?

50:11.017 --> 50:13.518
Hang on. Wait. Wait.

50:17.589 --> 50:20.160
What if it's not a copycat?

50:20.260 --> 50:22.586
What if it's something else? What if...

50:22.886 --> 50:26.271
<i>somehow, he found a way to come back?</i>

50:27.000 --> 50:28.356
You mean Judas?

50:29.802 --> 50:32.638
Hang on. My boyfriend just came home.

50:34.741 --> 50:36.410
- Hi.
- Hey.

50:36.910 --> 50:39.947
- Everything all right?
- Yeah. I'm just chatting to an old friend.

50:40.047 --> 50:42.582
Okay. I'm gonna crash pretty soon.
I'm pretty beat.

50:42.682 --> 50:43.781
Okay.

50:49.922 --> 50:50.991
<i>Annie.</i>

50:51.091 --> 50:52.529
Look, I don't know what's going on here,

50:52.629 --> 50:55.328
but if you have a boyfriend,
then why don't you go talk to him?

50:56.429 --> 50:59.664
If I thought he'd believe me, I would.

51:02.035 --> 51:06.978
At first, I thought that it was
all in my head, but...

51:07.278 --> 51:10.119
I know that there's
something in this house...

51:11.219 --> 51:16.801
<i>something watching me,
which I guess does sound pretty crazy.</i>

51:18.017 --> 51:21.790
Look, I might know somebody
that can help you.

51:25.125 --> 51:28.127
Yeah, yeah! Jesus Christ!

51:32.999 --> 51:35.402
- We're looking for Stevie.
- No, thank you.

51:36.102 --> 51:39.539
- Whoa, hold on!
- Get your goddamn hands off my door.

51:39.639 --> 51:43.190
Relax. I'm friends with Stevie.
Just tell her that Annie's here.

51:44.144 --> 51:46.480
She's gone. She left with her brother.

51:47.080 --> 51:49.816
- When is she coming back?
- They're not coming back. Bye.

51:49.916 --> 51:53.417
Wait! I really need to talk to her.

51:56.021 --> 51:58.392
If Giles finds out that I let somebody
talk to you, he's gonna kill me.

51:58.492 --> 52:00.455
It's okay.

52:04.930 --> 52:08.515
Fine. That makes me
look like an asshole.

52:11.438 --> 52:13.482
Hi, Annie.

52:13.740 --> 52:15.922
Hi, Stevie.

52:17.610 --> 52:19.376
Hi. I'm June.

52:20.380 --> 52:23.197
June's mom was Jenny Glick.

52:23.297 --> 52:24.764
I can't help you.

52:25.986 --> 52:29.156
You don't even know why we're here yet.

52:29.656 --> 52:32.459
I'm leaving today.

52:32.559 --> 52:35.377
Giles has us packed already.

52:35.477 --> 52:37.654
Where are you going?

52:37.754 --> 52:41.731
- He doesn't want to see me get hurt.
- People are already getting hurt.

52:42.702 --> 52:44.071
I know.

52:44.671 --> 52:49.342
You know? And you don't want to help?
You just want to run away?

52:49.442 --> 52:52.913
No, it... it's not running away. It's...

52:53.013 --> 52:55.048
See, you can't see
the whole picture because...

52:55.148 --> 52:57.706
- Stevie, stop. Enough.
- Annie, you're...

52:57.806 --> 53:00.921
No, Stevie, wait! Because...

53:01.021 --> 53:03.066
Damn it.

53:04.390 --> 53:07.214
Well, Stevie's right, you know?

53:07.594 --> 53:11.824
- About what?
- About getting out of here.

53:12.966 --> 53:15.235
Look, June...

53:15.335 --> 53:19.373
If this is anything
like what I dealt with...

53:20.473 --> 53:24.853
It's not worth it,
and you should get out of here.

53:31.283 --> 53:34.519
Leaving won't make a difference.

53:35.121 --> 53:39.442
It's attached to me, whatever it is.

53:40.093 --> 53:45.082
The only option I have is to go
in there and find out what it wants.

53:48.201 --> 53:50.271
Thank you.

54:00.979 --> 54:02.996
June.

54:04.384 --> 54:06.555
Why are you so convinced
that it's Judas?

54:08.755 --> 54:11.567
Because I think he's my dad.

54:24.470 --> 54:26.869
- Hey.
- Hi.

54:28.374 --> 54:30.966
- How are you?
- Good.

54:33.179 --> 54:34.282
Do you know this girl?

54:36.416 --> 54:38.618
That's Annie... Annie Barlow.

54:38.718 --> 54:39.987
Oh, I thought you didn't know her.
I thought...

54:40.087 --> 54:42.222
Annie, this is Daniel.

54:42.322 --> 54:43.781
Nice to meet you.

54:46.025 --> 54:48.428
Well, I got to get going to work,
so I'll see you later.

54:48.528 --> 54:51.031
Okay. Have a good night.

54:51.631 --> 54:53.798
Nice meeting you.

55:38.443 --> 55:40.813
So Daniel didn't hear anything?

55:40.913 --> 55:45.186
No, which is why I thought
I was imagining it.

55:46.286 --> 55:47.694
Why did you stay?

55:49.122 --> 55:51.800
Because you have no idea
what you're doing.

55:53.226 --> 55:55.073
So, what now?

55:57.330 --> 56:00.066
Do you have anything of his?

56:00.166 --> 56:01.678
No.

56:22.254 --> 56:24.991
It wants us to go upstairs.

56:25.091 --> 56:28.092
God damn it, I hate this shit.

56:36.234 --> 56:38.899
It trapped me in here.

56:39.239 --> 56:41.660
Wouldn't let me out.

56:42.341 --> 56:44.849
Why this room?

56:45.845 --> 56:48.546
So it could get me in there.

57:02.662 --> 57:05.268
We're gonna need a candle.

57:28.888 --> 57:31.357
Watch your head on this.

57:50.308 --> 57:51.621
Okay.

58:02.721 --> 58:04.989
Okay, let's sit down.

58:25.243 --> 58:27.798
Okay, what do we do now?

58:28.814 --> 58:30.550
I don't know. We wait.

59:07.119 --> 59:09.020
What is that?

59:11.257 --> 59:14.494
That's the song I heard in my dream.

59:15.094 --> 59:19.717
It was the last song that was playing
when Ellie Ford was killed.

59:35.514 --> 59:36.668
Annie?

59:49.229 --> 59:51.264
Annie?

59:56.702 --> 59:59.072
Annie, what are you doing?

59:59.172 --> 01:00:01.399
What are you doing?

01:00:10.449 --> 01:00:13.195
I can't get it to open, Annie!

01:00:14.020 --> 01:00:16.056
Annie!

01:00:16.156 --> 01:00:17.955
Annie!

01:00:26.098 --> 01:00:28.901
Pink room. Pink room.

01:00:29.001 --> 01:00:31.938
- What?
- Pink room. Pink room.

01:00:32.038 --> 01:00:35.541
- Pink room. Pink room.
- Pink?

01:00:35.641 --> 01:00:36.776
- Pink room.
- Pink?

01:00:36.876 --> 01:00:40.179
- Pink room. Pink room.
- What?

01:00:44.917 --> 01:00:47.554
Shit. Shit. Shit!

01:00:47.654 --> 01:00:50.723
Where is it? Shit.

01:00:53.860 --> 01:00:57.096
Come on. Come on. Come on.
Come on. Come on. Come on.

01:00:58.732 --> 01:01:00.526
Come on.

01:01:02.135 --> 01:01:03.975
Come on.

01:01:17.116 --> 01:01:20.386
Come on. Come on.

01:01:22.789 --> 01:01:25.830
I'm so sorry, Annie!

01:01:37.669 --> 01:01:41.773
Annie. Oh, God, please don't be dead.
Please don't be dead!

01:01:42.742 --> 01:01:44.812
Oh, God.

01:01:45.211 --> 01:01:48.047
Come on, Annie. Come on.

01:02:48.408 --> 01:02:50.164
Hey.

01:02:51.744 --> 01:02:55.649
- What happened?
- Looks like you hit your head pretty bad.

01:02:56.549 --> 01:02:58.786
Hey, just take it easy, all right?

01:02:59.786 --> 01:03:02.421
That's not Judas.

01:03:02.521 --> 01:03:04.667
It's Ellie.

01:03:06.425 --> 01:03:10.033
When you were at Ellie's place,
did you see a record player?

01:03:10.329 --> 01:03:11.280
Yeah.

01:03:13.464 --> 01:03:15.629
Yeah, that song was...

01:03:15.729 --> 01:03:17.837
Wait, how did you know
she had a record player?

01:03:17.937 --> 01:03:20.939
She was trying to show us something.

01:03:21.907 --> 01:03:24.017
- Hey, I said take it easy.
- No. No, no, no.

01:03:24.117 --> 01:03:27.113
I got to get back to Ellie's.
There's something there that I'm missing.

01:03:27.513 --> 01:03:30.950
- You're not in any shape to go anywhere.
- No, just give me a minute. I'll be fine.

01:03:31.050 --> 01:03:34.287
- No, I'll go. You stay.
- No, I'm... I'm fine. I'm just...

01:03:34.387 --> 01:03:39.224
Look, you'll slow me down, all right?
Just... text me the address.

01:03:41.761 --> 01:03:43.514
Wait.

01:03:45.164 --> 01:03:49.540
When we were upstairs,
you said, "pink room."

01:03:50.169 --> 01:03:52.543
What's the pink room?

01:03:54.941 --> 01:03:58.475
I don't know. It's all she'd tell me.

01:04:17.558 --> 01:04:19.668
- Hi.
- <i>June.</i>..

01:04:19.768 --> 01:04:22.577
<i>I've been calling you for over an hour.</i>

01:04:23.001 --> 01:04:25.304
I know. I'm sorry.

01:04:25.404 --> 01:04:27.740
<i>Are you still with Annie?</i>

01:04:28.240 --> 01:04:31.979
No, she's gone.
She went to look at Ellie's.

01:04:32.912 --> 01:04:36.649
<i>What the hell are you two doing, June?
Where are you?</i>

01:04:36.749 --> 01:04:38.565
- Home.
- <i>Okay, look.</i>

01:04:39.690 --> 01:04:42.488
<i>Stay there. I can be there in two hours.</i>

01:04:42.588 --> 01:04:45.057
No, you don't have to come home.

01:04:45.157 --> 01:04:49.695
<i>June, I'm serious.
I do not want you to get hurt. Please.</i>

01:04:51.997 --> 01:04:54.831
Okay, yeah, I'll be right here.

01:05:09.414 --> 01:05:11.450
Hello.

01:05:11.550 --> 01:05:13.877
This is Daniel Meyer.

01:05:14.120 --> 01:05:18.424
Look... I just got off the phone
with June, and...

01:05:18.524 --> 01:05:21.563
I'm worried that she has more to do
with this whole case than I thought.

01:05:23.463 --> 01:05:26.499
Look, I'm calling you because...

01:05:26.599 --> 01:05:28.954
I don't want to bring her in...

01:05:29.054 --> 01:05:33.963
<i>Not yet. So, can you just... Can you
just meet at our house in two hours?</i>

01:05:35.507 --> 01:05:37.176
Of course.

01:05:37.276 --> 01:05:41.065
Yeah. And we'll just see
what she has to say.

01:05:41.547 --> 01:05:43.783
Officer Meyer...

01:05:43.883 --> 01:05:46.392
I really appreciate this.

01:10:32.570 --> 01:10:34.785
Can I help you?

01:10:36.075 --> 01:10:38.170
Maybe.

01:10:40.312 --> 01:10:42.844
What do you do here exactly?

01:10:43.415 --> 01:10:46.118
Well, people come here to take pictures.

01:10:46.218 --> 01:10:48.387
You can bring your own equipment,
or we can rent you some.

01:10:48.487 --> 01:10:51.156
But we rent you the room,
and we provide the models.

01:10:51.256 --> 01:10:54.092
There's no pissing,
and there's no screwing.

01:10:54.192 --> 01:10:55.690
You interested?

01:11:00.398 --> 01:11:02.765
Do you know who this is?

01:11:06.337 --> 01:11:11.026
Yeah. She's one of the models here.
Haven't seen her around in a while, though.

01:11:12.844 --> 01:11:14.680
Who likes to take her picture?

01:11:15.480 --> 01:11:17.442
Lady, I wouldn't tell you
even if I could.

01:11:21.086 --> 01:11:24.723
Look, I just want to know
a little more information about her.

01:11:24.823 --> 01:11:26.827
Yeah? Why don't you ask her yourself?

01:11:28.227 --> 01:11:30.076
She's dead.

01:11:36.768 --> 01:11:39.102
Oh, my.

01:11:42.607 --> 01:11:46.744
She was murdered.
And her name was Ellie Ford.

01:11:52.683 --> 01:11:56.055
- Oh, Jesus. What?
- Do you know what this is?

01:11:56.655 --> 01:11:58.034
Yeah.

01:11:58.134 --> 01:12:00.637
It's a Houston area code.

01:12:02.094 --> 01:12:04.660
She was from Houston.

01:12:10.868 --> 01:12:13.272
Hey, listen.

01:12:15.373 --> 01:12:20.045
Think you might want to go back there and
take a look at one of those rooms with me?

01:12:21.880 --> 01:12:23.738
I'm good. Thanks.

01:12:28.987 --> 01:12:30.988
Open the door!

01:13:23.507 --> 01:13:25.542
Hello?

01:13:29.280 --> 01:13:31.313
Ellie?

01:13:34.185 --> 01:13:36.694
Ellie Ford?

01:13:50.202 --> 01:13:53.078
- Miss Abbott.
- What do you want?

01:13:53.872 --> 01:13:56.909
- Just a little more of your time.
- Not tonight. I'm busy.

01:13:57.009 --> 01:13:59.844
It won't take long... I promise.

01:14:03.448 --> 01:14:05.970
Do you want to answer your phone?

01:14:06.385 --> 01:14:07.926
I can wait.

01:14:12.757 --> 01:14:15.260
- Hello?
- <i>June! Jesus. Are... are you okay?</i>

01:14:15.360 --> 01:14:18.364
Yeah, I'm fine. Agent Ballard is here.

01:14:18.464 --> 01:14:21.700
<i>Listen carefully to me.
Just stay away from him.</i>

01:14:21.800 --> 01:14:25.304
- Why?
- <i>It's Ballard... He's the copycat.</i>

01:14:30.542 --> 01:14:34.113
- <i>June? June, can you hear me?</i>
- Yeah, I heard you.

01:14:34.213 --> 01:14:37.883
<i>I'm gonna call in squad cars now,
but you need to get out of there.</i>

01:14:37.983 --> 01:14:41.587
Would you like something to drink?
Some coffee?

01:14:42.387 --> 01:14:44.650
I don't drink coffee.

01:14:45.257 --> 01:14:47.658
Some water would be great.

01:15:27.298 --> 01:15:30.869
Okay, I'm... I'm outside.
I don't think he heard me.

01:15:30.969 --> 01:15:35.541
<i>Okay, good. Now, listen,
I need you to stay hidden, okay?</i>

01:15:35.641 --> 01:15:39.878
- <i>They're saying he attacked Annie Barlow.</i>
- Oh, my God! Is she okay?

01:15:39.978 --> 01:15:41.380
<i>They... they haven't said
on the radio yet.</i>

01:15:41.480 --> 01:15:44.216
<i>Paramedics just arrived,
but we know it was Ballard.</i>

01:15:44.316 --> 01:15:46.784
<i>Neighbors saw him leaving.</i>

01:15:47.319 --> 01:15:50.155
She was just with me.
She was trying to help me.

01:15:50.255 --> 01:15:53.625
<i>June, I'm so sorry. I...</i>

01:15:54.626 --> 01:15:56.490
<i>June?</i>

01:15:58.863 --> 01:16:00.694
June?!

01:16:01.333 --> 01:16:03.696
Where did you go?!

01:16:58.589 --> 01:17:01.026
June! What are you doing? Are you okay?

01:17:01.126 --> 01:17:03.770
I'm okay. I tied him up.

01:17:04.396 --> 01:17:07.434
Yeah, you sure did. Oh, my God.
I was worried about you.

01:17:08.834 --> 01:17:10.323
Are you sure you're not hurt?
Are you okay?

01:17:10.423 --> 01:17:12.424
I'm fine.

01:17:13.271 --> 01:17:15.273
She attacked me.

01:17:15.373 --> 01:17:18.510
Units are on the way right now. We're gonna
figure this out as soon as we can.

01:17:18.610 --> 01:17:20.446
What's there to figure out?

01:17:20.546 --> 01:17:23.281
It's pretty clear
what's going on. You...

01:17:32.524 --> 01:17:35.294
Honey... hey, everything's
gonna be fine, okay?

01:17:35.394 --> 01:17:36.328
Okay.

01:17:36.428 --> 01:17:38.363
I'm gonna go call and see
where the other officers are.

01:17:38.463 --> 01:17:40.532
- Okay.
- I'll be right back, okay?

01:17:40.632 --> 01:17:42.134
- Okay.
- You're doing great, June.

01:17:42.234 --> 01:17:43.802
I'll be right back.

01:20:08.245 --> 01:20:10.507
Now, agent Ballard,

01:20:10.607 --> 01:20:14.619
if you'll bear with me,
shouldn't be too much longer.

01:20:14.719 --> 01:20:16.888
- Daniel?
- Yeah.

01:20:16.988 --> 01:20:19.273
Where are the cars?

01:20:21.793 --> 01:20:23.372
Should be here soon.

01:20:25.230 --> 01:20:28.511
- Then I'm gonna wait outside.
- Honey, wait.

01:20:40.779 --> 01:20:42.480
Daniel.

01:20:42.580 --> 01:20:47.582
This was one thing I was hoping
we could do... together.

01:20:51.322 --> 01:20:54.852
It feels so good
to finally talk about this.

01:20:58.262 --> 01:21:03.235
I've been trying to talk to you
about it for a while now, but...

01:21:04.035 --> 01:21:06.664
things got complicated.

01:21:11.209 --> 01:21:12.574
See...

01:21:17.315 --> 01:21:21.720
I fell in love with you...
long before we ever met.

01:21:21.820 --> 01:21:23.723
Please stop.

01:21:24.823 --> 01:21:26.707
He told me how to find you.

01:21:28.960 --> 01:21:31.421
He told me...

01:21:33.799 --> 01:21:35.832
that you were Jenny Glick's daughter.

01:21:38.670 --> 01:21:41.187
Do you have any idea...

01:21:42.340 --> 01:21:45.343
how special that makes you?

01:21:49.214 --> 01:21:51.788
He speaks to me, June...

01:21:52.684 --> 01:21:54.653
Judas.

01:21:54.753 --> 01:21:59.129
No, he doesn't, Daniel. He's dead!

01:22:00.125 --> 01:22:02.593
Oh, he does.

01:22:02.693 --> 01:22:07.260
I see him every time
I look into your eyes.

01:22:08.066 --> 01:22:10.613
He told me that...

01:22:11.369 --> 01:22:16.323
that you truly are the one person
to carry on his work.

01:22:18.609 --> 01:22:20.278
That's what brought us together.

01:22:20.378 --> 01:22:24.281
No, Daniel, I loved you.

01:22:27.518 --> 01:22:30.399
I'm only here to help you.

01:22:40.064 --> 01:22:42.137
It's beautiful.

01:22:43.401 --> 01:22:44.399
Don't you see it?

01:22:46.838 --> 01:22:51.009
This way, we can do his work...

01:22:51.109 --> 01:22:53.144
together.

01:22:53.244 --> 01:22:57.281
I almost shouted for joy
when you brought Annie home.

01:22:59.651 --> 01:23:01.052
What are you talking about?

01:23:01.152 --> 01:23:05.857
Well, after tonight,
I was gonna take you to go find her...

01:23:06.357 --> 01:23:08.927
but you did the hard part for me.

01:23:09.027 --> 01:23:11.963
Oh, you should've seen her face...

01:23:12.063 --> 01:23:13.565
- ...right when she died.
- Oh, my God!

01:23:13.665 --> 01:23:16.442
Daniel, I didn't bring her to you!

01:23:16.542 --> 01:23:18.816
Yes, you did.

01:23:21.072 --> 01:23:23.388
And Maggie?

01:23:23.975 --> 01:23:27.011
You found the Bible page in my purse.

01:23:27.111 --> 01:23:30.178
Do you have the Bible here
with you still?

01:23:31.315 --> 01:23:35.394
You can pick out a page.
Oh, it could be our thing.

01:23:37.722 --> 01:23:43.431
I don't want to pick out a page, Daniel.
Please put the knife down.

01:23:44.896 --> 01:23:46.759
June...

01:23:47.532 --> 01:23:49.201
You're not even trying.

01:23:50.101 --> 01:23:51.985
Daniel...

01:23:52.771 --> 01:23:56.041
Stop. Daniel, stop!

01:23:57.642 --> 01:24:01.502
Daniel, stop! Stop it!

01:24:03.381 --> 01:24:05.550
This is what you were meant for.

01:24:05.650 --> 01:24:09.488
I'm only here to help you
take the next step.

01:24:09.788 --> 01:24:12.298
Now, take this knife...

01:24:13.391 --> 01:24:18.193
and cut off his goddamn head,
so we can really get started.

01:24:41.600 --> 01:24:43.301
God!

01:24:51.041 --> 01:24:52.898
June!

01:25:07.744 --> 01:25:09.708
June?

01:25:14.552 --> 01:25:16.591
Honey...

01:25:17.689 --> 01:25:20.218
That's a pretty good trick.

01:25:24.695 --> 01:25:27.735
I'm realizing now that maybe...

01:25:28.900 --> 01:25:32.933
you weren't as ready
for this responsibility as I thought.

01:25:33.938 --> 01:25:36.205
And that's okay.

01:25:45.783 --> 01:25:48.495
I love you, June.

01:25:49.120 --> 01:25:51.652
And I'm sorry...

01:25:53.358 --> 01:25:57.372
But I lied when I gave you that ring...

01:25:57.472 --> 01:26:00.741
and said that it didn't mean anything.

01:26:03.001 --> 01:26:05.368
Truth is, I...

01:26:07.038 --> 01:26:09.842
I wanted to ask you to marry me
right then and there.

01:26:14.445 --> 01:26:17.027
But I chickened out...

01:26:18.816 --> 01:26:20.930
'Cause I didn't want to scare you away.

01:26:23.988 --> 01:26:27.155
We have a special connection, June.

01:26:34.164 --> 01:26:37.232
And I never want to spoil it...

01:26:44.208 --> 01:26:46.609
not for the world.

01:26:59.322 --> 01:27:01.879
So don't give up on me.

01:27:02.660 --> 01:27:05.227
I won't give up on you.

01:30:06.443 --> 01:30:08.413
- Hello?
- <i>Hello?</i>

01:30:08.513 --> 01:30:10.883
- <i>Is this June Abbott?</i>
- Yes, it is. Who's this?

01:30:12.691 --> 01:30:14.285
It's Stevie.

01:30:14.385 --> 01:30:17.889
Stevie? I can... I can barely
hear you. Are you okay?

01:30:17.989 --> 01:30:18.990
<i>I'm fine.</i>

01:30:19.090 --> 01:30:21.566
<i>June, I have a... Hello? Are you there?</i>

01:30:21.666 --> 01:30:25.396
Yeah. I have a bad connection.
I'm listening.

01:30:25.863 --> 01:30:28.700
I have a... I have a message for you.

01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:31.402
<i>It's from Annie.</i>

01:30:31.502 --> 01:30:36.541
<i>She wants you to know that it's starting
again, that you need to be careful.</i>

01:30:36.641 --> 01:30:38.776
What?

01:30:38.876 --> 01:30:42.079
<i>I have to go. It's... it's dangerous
for me to keep talking to you.</i>

01:30:42.179 --> 01:30:45.125
No, no, no, no. Wait. Wait.
Don't hang up.
