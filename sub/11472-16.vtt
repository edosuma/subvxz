WEBVTT

00:04.404 --> 00:05.839
(LAUGHING)

00:05.872 --> 00:07.708
They got a lotta
crap here, huh?

00:07.741 --> 00:08.742
No kidding.

00:09.610 --> 00:12.178
I think I'm gonna
try to sell all my junk.

00:12.212 --> 00:14.981
You know, my crap
is way better
than this crap.

00:15.015 --> 00:16.216
Look at
all these books, man.

00:16.249 --> 00:17.618
Why do people
save their books,

00:17.651 --> 00:19.485
Like...
Read a book twice?

00:19.520 --> 00:21.387
They're probably
just bragging to us,
you know?

00:21.421 --> 00:23.557
Ooh! Look at all these
books I've read.

00:23.590 --> 00:26.593
I'm so clever!
I read a lot of books
and stuff!

00:29.730 --> 00:31.497
Oh... Check it out, man!

00:32.098 --> 00:33.700
They got bongos!

00:36.236 --> 00:37.971
Yep.

00:38.004 --> 00:40.373
We could play
evil ways
if we had these.

00:40.406 --> 00:41.975
Yeah, actually,
that would bring

00:42.008 --> 00:44.477
the Andopolis drum kit
to an even 30 pieces.

00:44.945 --> 00:46.246
31 pieces.

00:47.981 --> 00:49.583
All right.
I'm gonna buy
these, man.

00:50.216 --> 00:52.418
This garage sale rules.

00:52.452 --> 00:55.021
Hey, man, listen,
you gotta be quiet

00:55.055 --> 00:57.223
because my dad's really
pissed off at me.

00:57.658 --> 00:58.725
Why?

00:58.759 --> 01:00.360
Did he see your
report card?

01:00.393 --> 01:02.162
No, I was playing
American Band

01:02.195 --> 01:04.565
while he was watching
60 Minutes.

01:07.868 --> 01:09.169
Um...

01:09.202 --> 01:11.805
Nick, where
are your drums?

01:15.408 --> 01:18.478
<i>♪♪ I don't give a damn</i>

01:20.146 --> 01:23.083

02:05.526 --> 02:08.028
I think you'd better
lower your voice, son.

02:08.061 --> 02:10.664
You had no right to give
my drums away!

02:10.697 --> 02:13.534
Those drums were
making you go deaf.

02:13.567 --> 02:16.069
Otherwise,
you would have heard
all the times

02:16.102 --> 02:18.238
that I tried to tell you
to clean up your act.

02:18.271 --> 02:19.940
You know that I've
been trying.

02:19.973 --> 02:21.742
Fine. With a little
more effort,

02:21.775 --> 02:24.711
you could end up living
in a cardboard box.

02:24.745 --> 02:27.648
Those drums were my
personal property.

02:27.681 --> 02:30.984
Your only personal property
is your future.

02:31.017 --> 02:32.519
Maybe the drums
are my future!

02:32.553 --> 02:33.987
Why don't you think
about that?

02:34.020 --> 02:35.756
End of conversation.

02:39.292 --> 02:40.527
You owe me money.

02:41.628 --> 02:42.829
Excuse me?

02:42.863 --> 02:46.933
Those were my drums,
I paid for them,
and you sold them,

02:46.967 --> 02:48.268
And I want the money.

02:48.301 --> 02:49.570
How much did you
spend on drums

02:49.603 --> 02:51.271
and how much
did you spend on drugs?

02:54.174 --> 02:55.776
Give me my money!

03:01.114 --> 03:03.416
End of conversation.

03:05.686 --> 03:07.788
Fine. You know what?
I'm outta here.

03:07.821 --> 03:10.190
And I hope that you enjoy
your peace and quiet.

03:14.561 --> 03:18.632
There's something wrong
with these cans!

03:18.665 --> 03:22.035
He hates these cans!

03:22.068 --> 03:23.637
The Jerk
is the perfect movie.

03:23.670 --> 03:26.139
There isn't one scene in it
that isn't hilarious.

03:26.172 --> 03:28.241
Nope.
Caddyshack'sbetter.

03:28.274 --> 03:29.409
Way funnier.

03:29.442 --> 03:31.077
Ted Knight
is the funniest.

03:31.111 --> 03:33.046
Ooh, Billy,
Billy, Billy.

03:33.079 --> 03:35.481
Ooh, Billy,
Billy, Billy!
Huh?

03:35.516 --> 03:38.519
No, no. That movie
is so uneven.

03:38.552 --> 03:41.187
I mean, yeah,
half of it rules,
but half of it sucks.

03:41.221 --> 03:44.658
It's just like Stripes.
You could not tell me
what happened

03:44.691 --> 03:46.927
in the second half
of the movie.

03:46.960 --> 03:49.495
They get reassigned
to Europe to work on
a top secret mission

03:49.530 --> 03:51.331
concerning the urban
assault vehicle.

03:51.364 --> 03:53.299
Then the stupid
border guys
wouldn't let them in.

03:53.333 --> 03:55.001
That's when, um...
Um, Sam?

03:58.004 --> 03:59.740
Can I talk to you
for a second?

04:01.942 --> 04:02.943
Uh...

04:03.510 --> 04:04.511
Yeah.

04:05.979 --> 04:07.313
Over here.

04:09.015 --> 04:10.283
Oh.

04:16.923 --> 04:18.825
Sam, I just
broke up with Todd.

04:21.061 --> 04:22.262
Really?

04:23.964 --> 04:25.031
Wow.

04:26.399 --> 04:29.002
Um... I'm sorry.

04:29.035 --> 04:32.472
Don't be!
Todd's a jerk.

04:32.506 --> 04:34.107
He's only interested
in one thing.

04:34.140 --> 04:35.475
All these jocks are.

04:36.943 --> 04:38.545
Yeah. Yeah.

04:38.579 --> 04:39.980
So anyways,
I was wondering,

04:40.013 --> 04:41.381
are you gonna be
home tonight?

04:42.749 --> 04:43.884
Yeah.

04:43.917 --> 04:44.951
Good.

04:44.985 --> 04:46.520
'Cause I'm
gonna call you.

04:46.553 --> 04:48.555
I really need
someone to talk to.

04:48.589 --> 04:50.190
Ok. Uh...

04:50.223 --> 04:52.559
And, you know,
any time. Ha ha.

05:04.237 --> 05:05.806
My God!

05:05.839 --> 05:06.973
It's happening!

05:08.308 --> 05:10.410
You guys,
where's my chair?

05:11.578 --> 05:12.613
(GIGGLES)

05:14.548 --> 05:16.449
Shallots?
It's a potato.

05:16.482 --> 05:18.251
They're shallots, right?
What is a shallot?

05:18.284 --> 05:20.854
Hey, is anybody
using this chair?

05:21.822 --> 05:22.856
No.

05:23.356 --> 05:24.858
You can have it.

05:24.891 --> 05:26.192
Really?

05:26.226 --> 05:27.961
That's really nice
of you.

05:30.363 --> 05:31.932
Grateful dead.

05:31.965 --> 05:34.735
Music sucks.
Chicks are hot!

05:34.768 --> 05:35.736
Yeah.

05:35.769 --> 05:37.437
Does anybody wanna
give me a neck rub?

05:37.470 --> 05:39.405
Ha ha! God, Nick!

05:39.439 --> 05:42.643
I can't believe
you spent the night
on Daniel's floor!

05:42.676 --> 05:45.311
His carpet is, like,
infested!

05:45.345 --> 05:47.948
Better than
sleeping in
my maverick.

05:47.981 --> 05:50.116
Kinda.
(CHUCKLES)

05:50.150 --> 05:51.552
You gonna go home
tonight?

05:51.585 --> 05:54.721
No. Not as long as
that fascist is there.

05:55.956 --> 05:58.759
Hey, Ken, can I stay
at your house
tonight, man?

06:00.426 --> 06:02.128
No. My dad.

06:02.162 --> 06:04.330
He'll have
a conniption fit.

06:04.364 --> 06:05.599
Thanks a lot, man.

06:05.632 --> 06:07.768
You know, he doesn't
even let my grandma
stay over.

06:07.801 --> 06:09.202
He's got issues.

06:09.235 --> 06:10.904
Whatever, man. Thanks.

06:10.937 --> 06:13.940
I'd invite you
over again, Nick,
but you blew it.

06:13.974 --> 06:17.410
You gotta remember
to flush the toilet!

06:17.443 --> 06:19.145
My mom almost had
a heart attack
this morning.

06:19.179 --> 06:20.814
Oh!
NICK: He's just joking.

06:20.847 --> 06:21.782
I'm not joking!

06:21.815 --> 06:23.316
Can we not talk
about this now, please?

06:23.349 --> 06:24.417
I had to plunge...

06:24.450 --> 06:26.753
Can we not talk
about this now, please?

06:26.787 --> 06:29.255
Definitely doesn't
wanna stay at your place.
No.

06:29.289 --> 06:31.592
I... You know what? No.
No thanks.

06:34.861 --> 06:36.396
Hey, Lindsay,
you think that maybe

06:36.429 --> 06:38.865
I could, uh, stay
at your place tonight?

06:40.133 --> 06:44.070
God, Nick, if it were
up to me... Sure, but...

06:44.104 --> 06:46.707
Come on, my dad?
He's way worse
than Ken's dad.

06:46.740 --> 06:50.110
Yeah. No, don't...
No problem.

06:50.143 --> 06:51.612
Nice try, though, Nick.

06:53.213 --> 06:54.648
Shut up, man.

06:54.681 --> 06:56.316
What you should have done
is you should have
pretended to cry.

06:56.349 --> 06:59.786
(KIM LAUGHING)
You would have been in
if you pretended to cry.

06:59.820 --> 07:02.455
Dad, give me
one good reason

07:02.488 --> 07:04.390
why there can't be
a woman president.

07:04.424 --> 07:07.628
It's called 3 irrational
days per month.

07:07.661 --> 07:09.796
Now, I would have no issue
with the other 27,

07:09.830 --> 07:12.966
but we're talking about
the atomic bomb here!

07:12.999 --> 07:14.334
Oh, Harold!

07:14.367 --> 07:16.503
Dad, that is so stupid!

07:16.537 --> 07:18.539
You know,
men get periods, too.

07:18.572 --> 07:20.440
It has to do with
your body tides.

07:20.473 --> 07:22.843
My body does not have
a tide.

07:22.876 --> 07:24.945
(DOORBELL RINGS)

07:24.978 --> 07:28.081
Those religious
people have been
bothering me all day.

07:29.315 --> 07:31.484
Can't a man finish
his supper

07:31.518 --> 07:34.220
without those religious
types bothering us?

07:38.491 --> 07:40.460
Hey, uh, Mr. Weir.

07:40.493 --> 07:42.195
Is Lindsay home?

07:42.228 --> 07:43.764
She's eating dinner.

07:43.797 --> 07:46.332
Oh, yeah.
I can tell.

07:46.366 --> 07:48.635
God, it smells
really great in there.

07:49.670 --> 07:51.705
Let me guess.
(SNIFF)

07:52.372 --> 07:53.974
Meat?

07:54.007 --> 07:55.642
Congratulations.

07:57.043 --> 07:58.979
Hey... Nick.

07:59.012 --> 08:00.747
What are you doing?

08:00.781 --> 08:03.984
You know...
Just came by
to say hey.

08:04.017 --> 08:07.020
I... I didn't realize
that you guys were gonna
be eating so late.

08:08.088 --> 08:09.489
You guys eat late.

08:09.990 --> 08:11.725
Oh! Hey, Nick.

08:11.758 --> 08:15.328
Hey, Mrs. Weir.
Boy, I was just
saying...

08:15.361 --> 08:17.163
Your pot roast
smells amazing.

08:17.197 --> 08:20.200
Well, uh, would you like
to join us for dinner?

08:20.233 --> 08:22.068
We've got plenty
of food.

08:22.569 --> 08:23.637
I mean, sure,

08:23.670 --> 08:25.438
if... Yeah!
That would rock!

08:25.471 --> 08:27.473
I haven't eaten
dinner yet!

08:27.508 --> 08:29.175
Is it ok with you,
Mr. Weir?

08:29.209 --> 08:30.977
Oh. Yeah. Yeah.

08:31.011 --> 08:32.212
It would... Rock.

08:32.245 --> 08:33.313
MRS. WEIR: Come on.

08:33.346 --> 08:35.248
Oh, wow.
This worked out well.

08:43.524 --> 08:46.059
(MUFFLED)
Oh, my God!

08:47.193 --> 08:48.695
Mrs. Weir...

08:50.496 --> 08:52.298
This pot roast
is unbelievable!

08:52.332 --> 08:54.601
You're even a better
cook than my mom.

08:54.635 --> 08:57.538
Oh, I'm sure
she does fine.
(GIGGLES)

08:57.571 --> 08:59.005
You don't get to be
as tall as you are

08:59.039 --> 09:01.875
without somebody
doing something right
nutritionally.

09:05.946 --> 09:07.213
Hey, uh, so...

09:08.181 --> 09:09.315
Mr. Weir...

09:10.483 --> 09:12.218
You sell sleeping
bags, right?

09:13.419 --> 09:15.822
Yeah. Why,
you going camping?

09:16.890 --> 09:17.924
No.

09:18.892 --> 09:21.294
I've just been spending
a lot of my time

09:21.327 --> 09:23.797
sleeping on people's
floors...

09:23.830 --> 09:27.668
Lately, so, you know,
I thought I should
probably get a good bag.

09:27.701 --> 09:31.071
Why on earth are you
sleeping on people's
floors?

09:31.104 --> 09:32.706
My dad kicked me
out of the house.

09:32.739 --> 09:34.174
He didn't kick you out.

09:35.275 --> 09:37.978
He sold my drums.

09:38.011 --> 09:40.947
That doesn't really
seem like an invitation
to stay.

09:43.049 --> 09:43.917
Now, wait a minute.

09:43.950 --> 09:45.786
He didn't just sell
your drums.

09:45.819 --> 09:47.788
I mean, the man
must have had a reason.

09:47.821 --> 09:50.056
Yeah. He had a really
stupid reason.

09:50.090 --> 09:54.595
He said that my drums
were interfering
with my schoolwork.

09:56.797 --> 09:59.966
I think my schoolwork
was interfering
with my drums.

10:03.003 --> 10:04.805
How are you doing
at school?

10:07.173 --> 10:08.208
Terrible.

10:12.846 --> 10:14.815
Why don't you spend
the night over here?

10:17.150 --> 10:18.151
On the couch.

10:19.052 --> 10:20.153
What?

10:20.987 --> 10:22.288
Really?

10:22.322 --> 10:23.389
You mean it?

10:24.190 --> 10:25.191
Yeah.

10:30.163 --> 10:31.698
Oh, my gosh.

10:32.966 --> 10:36.369
My gosh. You guys are
the nicest people.

10:36.402 --> 10:39.773
Your whole family is...
So nice!

10:40.607 --> 10:42.242
Thank you so much!

10:43.476 --> 10:45.712

to you for a second.

yesterday.

That was Neal.
He just said it was me.

the greatest conversation
yesterday.

for hours!

trust you with this,

It's like I never
date nice guys.

11:59.319 --> 12:02.122
I should try it.
I mean, I think
I deserve to.

12:04.858 --> 12:06.727
So do you think
he likes me?

12:08.762 --> 12:10.731
It's hard to tell.

you can find out
for me?

with you, right, until her
parents go to sleep.

to give a back rub.

Lindsay and I are just
friends, ok?

13:24.104 --> 13:26.139

it's really cool
of her parents

stay at the house.

If she came to me
in the middle
of the night...

13:36.416 --> 13:39.352
And was, like,
you know...
"Nick, I love you..."

13:40.086 --> 13:42.122
I wouldn't
turn her away.

a back rub?

No.
Well, he will.

gonna do?

having him in my house!

kick him out, Lindsay!

hanging out with us?

a drummer,

practicing your drums.

wanted to be a drummer

23:08.221 --> 23:09.556
Good night.

23:22.603 --> 23:24.104
(BANGING)
NICK: Ow!

23:28.809 --> 23:29.943
Unh!

23:32.378 --> 23:33.647
Oh.

23:34.380 --> 23:35.682
Hey.

23:36.617 --> 23:39.853
I was, uh, working.

23:44.257 --> 23:45.526
Hey, um...

23:46.527 --> 23:48.662
Those are, uh,
nice pajamas.

23:54.200 --> 23:56.069
This is
a whole new world.

23:56.102 --> 23:57.470
I see double‐dating

23:57.504 --> 23:59.339
and triple‐dating

23:59.372 --> 24:01.074
and cheerleaders
at your house

24:01.107 --> 24:02.676
and me at your house.

24:03.544 --> 24:04.645
Congratulations,
Sam.

24:04.678 --> 24:06.046
I heard about
your good fortune.

24:06.079 --> 24:07.280
Thanks.

24:07.313 --> 24:09.015
She's the one that
should be thankful.

24:09.049 --> 24:10.551
You're a catch.

24:10.584 --> 24:14.154
So, can you get Bill
and I into this party?

24:14.187 --> 24:16.189
I don't know.
I haven't really
thought about it.

24:16.222 --> 24:18.124
Well, think about it.

24:18.158 --> 24:19.993
I don't...
I don't want to go.

24:20.026 --> 24:23.196
Why not?
Everyone wants to go
to a make‐out party.

24:23.229 --> 24:26.032
It's a make‐out party?
Uh‐huh.

24:26.066 --> 24:28.735
Nobody told me it was
a make‐out party.

24:28.769 --> 24:30.571
Well, you better
get ready to make out.

24:30.604 --> 24:32.438
Otherwise she's gonna
think you don't like her.

24:32.472 --> 24:33.874
You're not gonna
French kiss Cindy,

24:33.907 --> 24:35.075
are you, Sam?

24:35.108 --> 24:36.710
French kissing
is gross.

24:36.743 --> 24:38.512
I wouldn't French kiss
in a million years.

24:38.545 --> 24:39.913
And why the hell not?

24:41.281 --> 24:42.382
Hello.

24:42.415 --> 24:46.219
Germs. Spit. Mucus.
Old bits of food.

24:46.252 --> 24:47.387
That's just
to name a couple.

24:47.420 --> 24:49.022
There's a lot
of things in there.

24:49.055 --> 24:51.391
I mean, why do you
have to use your
tongue, anyway?

24:51.424 --> 24:53.694
Aren't you supposed
to kiss with your lips?

24:53.727 --> 24:55.095
Because it's not
a real kiss

24:55.128 --> 24:56.663
unless you use
your tongue.

24:56.697 --> 24:58.932
Why? What's the point?

24:58.965 --> 25:00.433
I mean, what are you
supposed to do?

25:00.466 --> 25:01.635
Lick the inside
of her mouth?

25:01.668 --> 25:03.403
Are you supposed
to lick her teeth?

25:03.436 --> 25:05.438
Do you make your
tongue hard or soft?

25:05.471 --> 25:07.373
God, Bill. Enough.

25:07.407 --> 25:08.575
What? I want
to know now.

25:08.609 --> 25:09.776
Since everyone
seems to think

25:09.810 --> 25:11.545
that French kissing
is so great.

25:11.578 --> 25:13.146
Ok, Bill.

25:13.179 --> 25:14.447
You put your tongue

25:14.480 --> 25:16.216
against her tongue.

25:18.819 --> 25:19.920
What if she puts
her tongue

25:19.953 --> 25:22.823
too far into
my mouth? Wh...

25:24.290 --> 25:25.526
What if I throw up?

25:25.559 --> 25:27.728
What if I throw up
all over her?

25:27.761 --> 25:29.129
What if I throw up
in her mouth?

25:29.162 --> 25:30.997
Ugh, shut up, Bill.

25:31.031 --> 25:32.265
That's disgusting.

25:32.298 --> 25:33.800
Sorry.

25:33.834 --> 25:35.201
Well, I'm just
telling you guys

25:35.235 --> 25:36.302
I'm not doing it.

25:36.336 --> 25:38.772
Well, I am.
As soon as possible.

25:38.805 --> 25:40.173
What do you say,
can we go?

25:40.707 --> 25:42.408
Well, if I take you,

25:42.442 --> 25:44.645
then I have to take
Gordon and Harris.

25:44.678 --> 25:46.513
Guys, I can't make it.

25:46.547 --> 25:47.814
I'm saving my virginity

25:47.848 --> 25:49.716
for the future
Mrs. Crisp.

25:49.750 --> 25:51.117
Nah, I have a date
with Judith.

25:51.151 --> 25:52.786
Every night's
a make‐out party with us.

25:53.954 --> 25:55.155
Yes.

25:56.056 --> 25:57.791
Whoopie.

25:57.824 --> 26:00.527
All these make‐out parties
start the same way...

26:00.561 --> 26:02.829
Spin the bottle.

26:02.863 --> 26:07.568
That's why this bottle
is the key to our
make‐out future.

26:07.601 --> 26:09.836
And the ability
to control the spin

26:09.870 --> 26:13.339
will discern whether
we have a good night
or a great night.

26:13.373 --> 26:15.341
You can't control
a bottle, Neal.

26:15.375 --> 26:16.910
Oh, can't I?
Just watch.

26:16.943 --> 26:18.812
I've been practicing
all week.

26:21.081 --> 26:22.549
How'd you do that?

26:22.583 --> 26:24.450
It's all finger control.

26:24.484 --> 26:26.620
All you have to do
is train yourself

26:26.653 --> 26:28.655
to make the bottle spin
2 revolutions,

26:28.689 --> 26:31.091
then you add or subtract
a small percentage of torque

26:31.124 --> 26:33.159
based on the position
of your target.

26:33.193 --> 26:34.460
That's amazing!

26:34.494 --> 26:37.030
All I can say is...
Hello, ladies!

26:37.564 --> 26:38.899
What?

26:42.035 --> 26:44.705
What if...
They don't wanna
kiss us?

26:44.738 --> 26:47.508
That's the genius
part of the game.
They have to!

26:47.541 --> 26:50.076
I don't know.
I just... I just

26:50.110 --> 26:52.045
don't wanna see
the expression
on their face

26:52.078 --> 26:54.981
when they see
that the bottle
lands on me.

26:55.015 --> 26:57.117
Bill, who cares
if they look disappointed?

26:57.150 --> 27:00.621
All I care about
is if they look disappointed
after the kiss.

27:00.654 --> 27:01.922
But I know
they won't with me,

27:01.955 --> 27:04.057
Because I plan on
delivering the goods.

27:06.092 --> 27:08.862
Do people French kiss
when they play
spin the bottle?

27:09.530 --> 27:11.131
Some do.

27:11.164 --> 27:12.866
Most don't.

27:12.899 --> 27:13.967
I do.

27:16.169 --> 27:17.337
I don't feel so good.

28:00.747 --> 28:02.182
Hey, Vicki.

28:14.928 --> 28:17.263
Bill, take off
your turtleneck.
That's my look.

28:17.297 --> 28:19.733
I can't. I'm not
wearing anything
underneath.

28:19.766 --> 28:21.868
Besides, I happen
to look cool
in a turtleneck.

28:21.902 --> 28:24.738
So do I!
Everyone looks cool
in turtlenecks.

28:24.771 --> 28:27.140
That's the point!
We can't both wear them.

28:27.173 --> 28:28.975
We'll look like
the smothers brothers.

28:29.910 --> 28:31.878
I'm not goin' in topless.

28:33.446 --> 28:34.981
Fine.
I'll take mine off.

28:37.183 --> 28:39.019
Nice dickey!

28:39.052 --> 28:40.186
Shut up.

28:41.121 --> 28:42.589
Guys, guys, ok...

28:42.623 --> 28:43.857
Be cool.

28:44.324 --> 28:45.391
You be cool.

28:46.693 --> 28:50.063
Just... Just don't
embarrass me, ok?

28:50.096 --> 28:52.032
What? Now that you're
going out with Cindy,

28:52.065 --> 28:54.768
you're ashamed of us?
Don't embarrass me.

28:54.801 --> 28:56.703
Fine. Be that way.
I don't care.

28:56.737 --> 28:58.805
(NEAL MIMICKING)

29:07.614 --> 29:08.982
Hey, guys.

29:11.317 --> 29:12.418
Hey, Sam.

29:13.587 --> 29:16.757
You, um...
You look really good.

29:17.423 --> 29:18.525
So do you, Cindy.

29:18.559 --> 29:19.960
You look beautiful.

29:21.327 --> 29:23.296
Thanks, Sam.
You're sweet.

29:23.329 --> 29:24.330
Come on.

29:36.409 --> 29:37.878
Are you going in?

29:38.411 --> 29:39.913
Don't rush me.

29:41.515 --> 29:43.650
Are you ok?

29:43.684 --> 29:45.819
You remember that scene
at the beginning
of <i>Animal House</i>

29:45.852 --> 29:47.688
where Flounder wants to
get into the fraternity,

29:47.721 --> 29:48.989
but they don't
think he's cool,

29:49.022 --> 29:50.156
so they put him
in that room

29:50.190 --> 29:51.925
with the blind guy
and the Indian guy?

29:54.294 --> 29:56.797
I feel like we're
about to be sent
into that room.

29:57.798 --> 29:59.032
Blind guys are cool.

29:59.065 --> 30:01.802
They have supersonic hearing.

30:05.872 --> 30:07.508
You're right.

30:07.541 --> 30:08.875
Let's mingle.

30:14.648 --> 30:17.250
So, did you kids have
a good day today?

30:18.318 --> 30:19.452
Uh...

30:21.655 --> 30:23.590
I don't know.
It was ok.

30:23.624 --> 30:25.926
I had, like,
the best day, Mrs. Weir.

30:25.959 --> 30:27.528
I took my first
drum lesson ever.

30:27.561 --> 30:29.229
Oh, wow.

30:29.262 --> 30:30.931
A drum lesson?

30:30.964 --> 30:32.966
Hey, how'd that go,
Nick?

30:32.999 --> 30:34.868
It went so well,
Mr. Weir.

30:34.901 --> 30:36.770
The drum teacher,
Terry Breeze,

30:36.803 --> 30:38.071
he's, like,
the coolest guy.

30:38.104 --> 30:40.541
He taught me how to hold
the drumsticks jazz style,

30:40.574 --> 30:41.975
like this.

30:42.008 --> 30:44.878
Paradiddle,
paradiddle,
paradiddle.

30:45.145 --> 30:46.079
Good.

30:46.112 --> 30:47.681
Nick, where did
you get money

30:47.714 --> 30:49.249
to take drum lessons?

30:49.282 --> 30:50.984
Um, your dad.

30:52.452 --> 30:54.988
Yeah. Nick's gonna work
part‐time as a stock boy
at my store

30:55.021 --> 30:56.089
to pay for his lessons.

30:56.122 --> 30:58.491
JEAN: Lessons.
Good for you.

30:58.525 --> 31:00.594
All right.
I'll get the ham,
and we'll eat.

31:00.627 --> 31:03.496
Let me help you, Mrs. Weir,
'cause hams can be heavy.

31:06.867 --> 31:10.270
Jeez. Dad, that's
really nice of you.

31:10.303 --> 31:11.371
What do you mean?

31:12.639 --> 31:15.141
I just mean that you're
playing records for Nick

31:15.175 --> 31:17.077
and giving him
drum lessons

31:17.110 --> 31:18.679
and letting him
stay at the house.

31:18.712 --> 31:19.980
That's...

31:20.013 --> 31:21.748
What's the deal?

31:21.782 --> 31:23.584
I'm trying to help
the kid out.

31:23.617 --> 31:25.085
What, you don't
want me to?

31:25.852 --> 31:27.788
No, I'm just
wondering why,

31:27.821 --> 31:29.222
when Nick
has a problem,

31:29.255 --> 31:30.824
you're nice
and logical.

31:30.857 --> 31:32.959
But when I do,
you just yell at me.

31:34.227 --> 31:36.530
That's because
I expect more from you.

31:37.698 --> 31:39.533
Nick's father
is a hard man.

31:39.566 --> 31:41.668
My old man
was the same way.

31:41.702 --> 31:43.236
Yeah, I know
the feeling.

31:43.937 --> 31:45.539
Lindsay?

31:45.572 --> 31:48.308
Trust me, you don't.

31:52.478 --> 31:55.949
Now, anytime you wanna
dance with me to Gene Krupa,

31:55.982 --> 31:57.250
I'll be around.

32:02.989 --> 32:04.958
(LAUGHTER)

32:04.991 --> 32:07.894
Oh, why does the bottle
keep landing on me?

32:07.928 --> 32:10.096
How come the bottle
never lands on me?

32:10.130 --> 32:11.431
GIRL: Ok. Whose spin?

32:15.802 --> 32:17.938
(LAUGHTER)

32:18.605 --> 32:20.040
That's 3 times.

32:20.073 --> 32:21.975
Now it's 7 minutes
in heaven.

I'll give you 8 1/2.

Oh, yes!

32:42.863 --> 32:44.430
Sam, I'm sorry.

32:44.965 --> 32:46.432
Yeah, sorry, Sam.

Hello. I'm Nick's father.

33:04.851 --> 33:06.787
Oh. Well, I'm Harold Weir.

33:06.820 --> 33:08.421
It's a pleasure
to meet you, sir.

33:08.454 --> 33:09.590
Come on in.

33:16.262 --> 33:18.098
Nick, it's time
to come home.

33:19.465 --> 33:20.634
Ok.

33:22.235 --> 33:25.071
Could I talk to you
in the kitchen
for a minute?

33:25.906 --> 33:27.207
Sure.

33:37.483 --> 33:40.554
Look, I appreciate
your letting Nick stay here.

33:40.587 --> 33:42.155
Oh, it was our pleasure.

33:42.188 --> 33:44.290
That's quite a kid
you've got there.

33:44.324 --> 33:45.491
Yeah.

33:46.326 --> 33:47.594
So, uh...

33:49.095 --> 33:51.297
You gave his
drums away, huh?

33:52.599 --> 33:55.802
I guess they may be
pretty distracting.

33:55.836 --> 33:58.238
You have no idea.

33:58.271 --> 34:01.141
Eh, things kids
will get into.

Uh‐huh.

Well,

34:08.448 --> 34:12.052
teenagers will try
all sorts of things.

gotta let 'em be kids.

is your son?

35:32.232 --> 35:33.600
This is ridiculous.

35:33.634 --> 35:35.869
There is obviously
something wrong
with that bottle.

35:35.902 --> 35:37.638
It keeps landing
on you, Bill.

35:38.238 --> 35:39.573
Switch with her.

35:40.040 --> 35:41.274
BILL: What?

35:41.608 --> 35:42.809
Ok.

35:48.915 --> 35:50.416
Ok. I'm spinning again.

35:52.853 --> 35:53.954
No!

35:53.987 --> 35:55.622
(LAUGHTER)

35:55.656 --> 35:57.924
Hey, just kiss him
and get it over with.

35:59.560 --> 36:00.794
GIRL: Ok, Vicki.

36:00.827 --> 36:02.162
Your turn.

36:08.935 --> 36:10.203
That's 3.

36:10.236 --> 36:11.371
Vicki and Bill
are goin' in

36:11.404 --> 36:12.873
for 7 minutes
in heaven.

36:14.307 --> 36:15.609
KIDS: Vicki and Bill...

36:15.642 --> 36:16.510
Shut up, you guys!

36:16.543 --> 36:18.579
<i>♪♪ Sittin' in a tree ♪♪</i>

36:18.612 --> 36:20.781
Come on. Let's just get
this over with.

36:27.287 --> 36:28.689
Unbelievable.

36:32.693 --> 36:33.827
Close the door.

36:39.866 --> 36:42.068
Well, uh, thanks again.

36:42.102 --> 36:43.604
I hope he wasn't
too much trouble.

36:43.637 --> 36:46.607
Oh, no. He wasn't
any trouble at all.

36:48.174 --> 36:49.876
I'll be out
in the car.

36:50.443 --> 36:51.712
Ok.

36:51.745 --> 36:52.846
Good night.

36:57.383 --> 36:59.452
You guys sure you
don't wanna adopt me?

37:01.988 --> 37:03.557
You sure you're
gonna be ok?

37:04.658 --> 37:05.792
Yeah.

37:07.127 --> 37:09.863
I mean, he came
looking for me, right?

37:09.896 --> 37:12.198
Didn't really think
that was gonna happen.

37:12.232 --> 37:15.101
Hey, stop by anytime.

37:15.135 --> 37:16.369
NICK: I will.

37:17.538 --> 37:19.072
I'll see you at school.

37:19.105 --> 37:21.341
Yeah. I'll see you
at school.

37:22.609 --> 37:27.881
Um, you know, I just...
Thank you so much.

37:29.149 --> 37:30.216
JEAN: Good night.

37:30.250 --> 37:31.484
Good night.

37:34.988 --> 37:37.524
I'm really glad
you could make it
tonight, Sam.

37:38.224 --> 37:39.860
Yeah, me, too.

37:41.461 --> 37:43.396
Cindy, do you wanna...

37:43.429 --> 37:46.366
Go in one of these rooms
and talk or something?

37:47.734 --> 37:48.769
Ok.

37:51.037 --> 37:52.372
Ok.

37:56.276 --> 37:57.811
Don't even think
about it, ok?

37:59.145 --> 38:00.814
I wasn't thinking
about anything.

38:00.847 --> 38:01.848
Good.

38:07.387 --> 38:09.590
That fabric softener
smells good.

38:09.623 --> 38:11.057
Just stay away
from me, ok?

38:11.091 --> 38:12.358
You're not gonna
touch me,

38:12.392 --> 38:15.228
and you're definitely not
gonna kiss me. Got it?

38:15.261 --> 38:16.697
You know...
You know what?

38:16.730 --> 38:17.731
You're a jerk.

38:19.600 --> 38:20.701
Excuse me?

38:20.734 --> 38:21.735
You're a jerk.

38:21.768 --> 38:23.403
I was just trying
to make small talk.

38:23.436 --> 38:25.906
I couldn't be less happy
to be in here with you,

38:25.939 --> 38:29.510
So quit acting like
I'm hoping I can kiss you.

38:29.543 --> 38:32.312
It's actually the last thing
that I want to do right now.

38:33.379 --> 38:36.016
You know what, Bill?
I'm... I'm sorry.

38:36.049 --> 38:37.784
Ok? That wasn't
nice of me.

38:41.354 --> 38:42.623
Don't worry about it.

38:44.858 --> 38:46.627
You only have...

38:46.660 --> 38:50.531
3 Minutes and 26...
26 seconds left...

38:51.331 --> 38:52.566
In heaven.

38:58.238 --> 38:59.706
Well, here we are.

39:00.140 --> 39:01.407
Yeah.

39:02.108 --> 39:03.343
Here we are.

39:16.890 --> 39:19.425
(TURNS RADIO ON)

39:19.459 --> 39:21.828
Well, maybe we should
listen to some music.

39:29.269 --> 39:30.370
You, uh...

39:30.403 --> 39:32.272
Can I ask you
a question?

39:32.305 --> 39:33.540
What?

39:35.141 --> 39:36.777
What's it like
being pretty?

39:37.678 --> 39:39.212
(LAUGHS)

39:39.245 --> 39:40.446
I don't know.

39:41.548 --> 39:43.416
Like, this is
the only way

39:43.449 --> 39:44.751
that I've ever looked.

39:46.019 --> 39:49.189
I think people
treat you nicer
when you're pretty.

39:49.222 --> 39:51.324
Why would you say that?

39:51.357 --> 39:52.959
'Cause they're never
nice to me.

39:52.993 --> 39:55.261
(CHUCKLES)
Well...

39:55.295 --> 39:57.230
This is not true, Bill.

39:57.263 --> 39:58.431
Every time I look at you,

39:58.464 --> 40:00.466
you look like you're having
a pretty good time.

40:01.401 --> 40:02.468
Really?

40:02.503 --> 40:03.804
Yeah. Yeah.

40:03.837 --> 40:06.039
You're always laughing
or something.

40:07.841 --> 40:09.676
So what are you
laughing about?

40:11.712 --> 40:13.780
I watch movies
in my head.

40:14.948 --> 40:16.817
Ha ha ha!

40:16.850 --> 40:17.984
Heh heh...

40:20.353 --> 40:21.655
Hey, Dad.

40:25.325 --> 40:27.427
That was really nice
what you did for Nick.

40:31.665 --> 40:34.868
I'm sorry you think
I don't treat you right
sometimes.

40:35.536 --> 40:38.772
I didn't say that, Dad.

40:38.805 --> 40:40.841
I just...

40:40.874 --> 40:44.010
Wish you could
talk to me like
you talk to Nick.

40:45.546 --> 40:47.080
You know what
the difference is

40:47.113 --> 40:48.615
between you and Nick?

40:50.483 --> 40:52.886
You're my daughter.

40:52.919 --> 40:55.889
And every second
you're out of this house,

40:55.922 --> 40:58.625
every second
that I can't see you

40:58.659 --> 41:00.694
or know what you're doing,

41:00.727 --> 41:02.195
it's...

41:02.228 --> 41:04.197
It's absolute torture
for me.

41:05.065 --> 41:07.868
Dad, I can't stay
inside all the time.

41:09.135 --> 41:10.203
I know.

41:12.973 --> 41:14.140
Why not?

41:14.174 --> 41:15.576
(LAUGHS)

41:26.587 --> 41:28.589
Good night, honey.

41:28.622 --> 41:30.056
All right.
Good night, Dad.

41:33.994 --> 41:37.831
So all the cans
behind Steve Martin
start springing holes,

41:37.864 --> 41:40.734
and Steve Martin says,
"There's something wrong
with these cans."

41:40.767 --> 41:42.503
And he sees
the guy shooting,
and he says,

41:42.536 --> 41:44.304
"That guy
hates these cans."

41:44.337 --> 41:46.172
(BOTH LAUGHING)

41:49.375 --> 41:50.476
It's really funny.

41:50.511 --> 41:53.213
Hysterically funny.
I gotta see that.
