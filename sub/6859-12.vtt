- <i>Slaves of the Republic</i> -

00:10.552 --> 00:15.114
{fad(500,1000)}Those who enslave others,
inevitably become slaves themselves.

<i>During a Separatist invasion

00:46.209 --> 00:49.090
Looks like Zygerria
is popular place this days.

00:50.144 --> 00:54.222
Whatever is happening is attracting
plenty of high-class scum.

01:19.160 --> 01:22.457
Let's hope the information our spies
gave us about the queen is accurate.

01:22.760 --> 01:23.614
Remember.

01:23.739 --> 01:26.168
I'll keep her occupyed
while you locate the missing

01:27.106 --> 01:29.660
How do you plan on
keeping the queen, occupyed?

01:31.637 --> 01:33.888
With my magnetic charm, of course.

01:34.620 --> 01:36.047
Yes, of course.

01:37.030 --> 01:38.738
Hold on to this, will you, buddy?

01:54.809 --> 01:55.922
Remind me why,

01:56.047 --> 01:58.251
I'm the one playing
a part of the slaves?

01:58.376 --> 02:00.820
I tried it once.
I wasn't any good at it.

02:01.198 --> 02:04.830
Besides, the role of master
comes easely to me.

02:05.334 --> 02:06.118
Really?

02:06.243 --> 02:08.399
This time try to be convincing at it.

02:28.188 --> 02:30.382
How can a civilisation this advanced,

02:30.598 --> 02:32.123
still practice slavery.

02:32.248 --> 02:35.215
It makes them wealthy
and powerful at the expensive others.

02:35.450 --> 02:37.245
Before the hutts bought my mother,

02:37.370 --> 02:40.097
she was sold
in a market just like this.

02:51.908 --> 02:54.189
Get up, you useless skug!

02:54.633 --> 02:56.795
Master, the bonds...

02:57.258 --> 02:58.552
They are too heavy.

02:59.410 --> 03:00.596
Tell it to my whip!

03:04.815 --> 03:06.534
You don't want to do that.

03:09.132 --> 03:10.840
Are you dare touch me?

03:11.191 --> 03:12.592
Excuse my slave.

03:12.895 --> 03:13.695
Friend,

03:13.986 --> 03:15.543
She is freshly caught.

03:16.559 --> 03:18.095
What have we here?

03:18.446 --> 03:20.392
You wear Zygerrian armour.

03:20.781 --> 03:22.598
But you are not one of us.

03:23.257 --> 03:24.500
Who are you?

03:24.997 --> 03:27.164
I've come for an audience
with the queen.

03:27.554 --> 03:29.405
Then you have an invitation?

03:29.665 --> 03:31.373
We can't juste let anyone in,

03:31.498 --> 03:33.003
to speak with her majesty.

03:33.171 --> 03:34.411
No invitation.

03:34.655 --> 03:36.341
But I do bring news,

03:36.720 --> 03:38.903
News the Queen will be eager to hear.

03:39.219 --> 03:40.460
I doubt that.

03:40.752 --> 03:42.805
You're nothing more than a brigand.

03:43.122 --> 03:44.820
I wouldn't say that,

03:45.144 --> 03:46.673
Espeacialy when the Queen'll learn,

03:46.798 --> 03:48.982
you prevented her from
hearing the news about

03:49.328 --> 03:50.657
Bruno Denturri.

03:53.801 --> 03:54.514
Halt!

03:54.871 --> 03:56.449
Cease all hostilities.

03:57.098 --> 04:01.011
This man is to be escorted
to the palace by order of the queen.

04:31.486 --> 04:35.045
Make certain all preparations
are complete for this evening.

04:40.316 --> 04:42.476
Some refreshments.

04:43.218 --> 04:44.282
My Queen.

04:44.670 --> 04:47.016
I present Lars Quell.

04:49.399 --> 04:53.061
You're the man who claims to be
acquainted with Bruno denturri?

04:53.460 --> 04:54.715
Yes your highness.

04:55.087 --> 04:59.423
However, when I spoke with him,
he failed to describe your beauty.

05:01.348 --> 05:02.310
Really?

05:02.843 --> 05:06.043
And did Bruno speak of my intense
hatred of him?

05:06.534 --> 05:08.997
Or did that escaped
his memory as well?

05:10.953 --> 05:12.908
He needed not speak
with your magesty.

05:14.725 --> 05:17.177
Bruno Denturri will not be speaking.

05:18.187 --> 05:19.267
Ever again.

05:20.297 --> 05:21.779
What do you mean?

05:21.947 --> 05:24.793
Bruno Denturri is dead, by my hand.

05:25.384 --> 05:27.361
Here is a slave from his palace.

05:27.681 --> 05:29.606
Compensation for my efforts.

05:31.517 --> 05:33.403
Unhand me, brigand!

05:37.273 --> 05:39.273
You impress me, Lars Quell.

05:40.995 --> 05:42.817
She's quiet a price.

05:43.383 --> 05:46.184
And to have defeated
Bruno Denturri in combat,

05:48.708 --> 05:50.852
You must be quite a warrior.

05:54.075 --> 05:56.472
The slave is certainly a fine stock.

05:57.149 --> 06:00.043
Bruno always know,
how to choose a beautiful female.

06:00.516 --> 06:03.233
Don't you dare, touch me.

06:07.065 --> 06:09.008
So, she will have to be processed.

06:09.619 --> 06:11.995
Her demeanor leaves
much to be desired.

06:13.092 --> 06:14.746
What is your price for her?

06:15.250 --> 06:16.332
With respect,

06:16.653 --> 06:18.695
how can I price
the beauty of this slave

06:18.820 --> 06:21.338
when I look upon
the magnificient of your highness.

06:21.506 --> 06:25.210
Who's beauty would make the brightest
star seel dull by comparaison.

06:26.545 --> 06:28.807
Lars Quell, you're flatter me.

06:29.364 --> 06:30.917
No, your majesty.

06:31.042 --> 06:32.183
How ever...

06:37.528 --> 06:39.772
Lars, stop it, stop it!

06:40.599 --> 06:42.609
You're a bold one aren't you?

06:43.097 --> 06:45.226
My reputation precedes me then.

06:45.773 --> 06:48.779
Perhaps we can find a way to put
a price on your slave.

06:49.353 --> 06:51.429
Come, walk with me.

07:29.926 --> 07:32.053
{PUB}Sir, take a look at this.

07:37.958 --> 07:40.589
Stand watch.
I'll take a closer look.

07:44.928 --> 07:46.251
Governor Roshti,

07:50.544 --> 07:53.164
Gvernor, I'm a friend, a Jedi.

07:53.807 --> 07:55.035
Here to help.

07:55.305 --> 07:56.774
Where are your people?

07:56.899 --> 07:59.019
They're... They're...

08:10.073 --> 08:11.739
Did you find out what the others are?

08:11.864 --> 08:14.430
Not yet. We've got
to get him out of here.

08:25.964 --> 08:26.872
You there!

08:26.997 --> 08:28.924
What are you doing with that slave?

09:00.707 --> 09:03.413
Slavery is a natural order of things.

09:03.906 --> 09:07.038
The weak deserve nothing more
than to near before the strong.

09:07.538 --> 09:09.226
Bound to our service.

09:09.496 --> 09:12.185
I will need men with your talents,

09:12.677 --> 09:14.655
to spread our ways across the galaxy.

09:20.602 --> 09:21.701
Let me go!

09:23.693 --> 09:25.887
You dare raise a hand
against your master?

09:26.376 --> 09:28.621
Cleary, you require
further processing.

09:30.851 --> 09:32.370
I won't go back there!

09:33.782 --> 09:34.823
Wait! Stop!

09:41.565 --> 09:42.934
Such a waist.

09:43.059 --> 09:45.685
But perhaps she was more trouble
than she's worth.

09:46.795 --> 09:48.065
But you Lars,

09:48.352 --> 09:50.850
you are proving quiet resourceful.

09:52.162 --> 09:53.343
Very well,

09:53.748 --> 09:56.595
I will pay your price
for this slave gril.

09:56.955 --> 10:01.157
It seems I am...
in need of a new servant.

10:03.367 --> 10:06.421
She is my gift to you your highness.

10:07.620 --> 10:10.405
You are a man of many surprises.

10:10.995 --> 10:12.261
It pleases me.

10:12.835 --> 10:15.256
I wish you to be my guest
at the slave auction.

10:15.543 --> 10:17.282
And to sit at my side.

10:30.764 --> 10:31.659
Well?

10:33.860 --> 10:35.042
Who is he?

10:35.514 --> 10:38.488
He hasn't talked,
but I will loose his tongue.

10:40.597 --> 10:44.349
Why would a slave tried to rescue
a slave from the palace?

10:45.561 --> 10:46.675
It's suicide.

10:50.775 --> 10:51.508
Wait.

10:52.740 --> 10:53.905
I know you.

10:54.209 --> 10:55.610
From the hologram.

10:57.854 --> 10:59.778
I never forget a Jedi.

11:09.121 --> 11:10.335
<i>Your highness...</i>

11:10.503 --> 11:11.788
<i>Zygerrians...</i>

11:12.505 --> 11:14.647
<i>Guests from a thousand worlds!</i>

11:14.772 --> 11:16.717
<i>Our auction begins,</i>

11:16.885 --> 11:19.550
<i>with slaves of unimage quality</i>

11:19.929 --> 11:22.431
<i>and impressive quantity.</i>

11:22.875 --> 11:27.584
<i>I give you Togruta
from the Kiros system.</i>

11:34.697 --> 11:38.005
<i>This handsome sample
represents a lot numbering.</i>

11:38.359 --> 11:41.735
<i>No less than 50 000 beings.</i>

11:43.036 --> 11:48.118
<i>His moult companions
are naturaly untrained in combat.</i>

11:48.243 --> 11:51.460
<i>There will be no rebellion
from this slaves.</i>

11:52.279 --> 11:55.992
Where do you 50 000 slaves
like the people of Kiros?

11:59.165 --> 12:01.428
Your Majesty, I have urgent news.

12:08.517 --> 12:10.787
All will be revealed in time.

12:14.450 --> 12:16.323
Before we begin the auction,

12:16.448 --> 12:19.175
I would welcome
our most special guest,

12:19.614 --> 12:21.198
Obi-Wan Kenobi.

12:23.369 --> 12:24.466
Jedi Knight.

12:29.874 --> 12:30.858
My friends...

12:30.983 --> 12:34.211
My good friends.
Do not fear the Jedi.

12:34.521 --> 12:37.896
They are no different from others
that we have forced into submission.

12:38.021 --> 12:42.136
For they have forsaken their ideas
to serve a corrupt senate.

12:42.406 --> 12:45.697
Every Jedi have become
a slave to the Republic.

12:46.710 --> 12:48.600
The Jedi Order is weak.

12:49.005 --> 12:51.014
And we will help break it.

12:53.398 --> 12:55.603
Teach the Jedi his place.

13:19.883 --> 13:22.786
{PUB}<i>Whip the Jedi!</i>

13:24.338 --> 13:25.984
<i>Whip the Jedi!</i>

13:26.385 --> 13:29.558
Looks like I have to
rescue you again, old man.

13:29.996 --> 13:32.365
I knew you would have a back up plan.

13:37.546 --> 13:39.251
Proove to me you are a slaver.

13:39.521 --> 13:41.027
Swing that whip!

13:41.195 --> 13:42.510
Or die beside him.

13:44.721 --> 13:46.985
Those are some lousy options.

13:57.083 --> 13:59.546
You leave me no choice, highness.

14:13.978 --> 14:15.687
Guards! Subdue them!

14:35.750 --> 14:36.917
Ahsoka! The queen!

14:38.064 --> 14:40.934
Looks like your slave empire
is finished, again.

14:41.422 --> 14:44.674
Get that thing out of my face,
you little slug.

15:22.046 --> 15:23.878
Such determination!

15:45.892 --> 15:49.369
You destroyed my auction
and frightened my customers.

15:51.059 --> 15:54.181
Count Dooku and half of my kingdom
are demanding your death.

15:56.323 --> 15:58.230
You should have listen to them.

15:59.108 --> 16:00.289
My friends!

16:00.610 --> 16:01.710
Where are they?

16:04.002 --> 16:05.810
Continue to misbehave,

16:07.143 --> 16:08.409
and they die.

16:15.484 --> 16:19.687
Almost curious Jedi who cares more
about his friends than his own mission.

16:20.125 --> 16:21.881
Hero. General.

16:23.923 --> 16:25.594
And now, my servant.

16:29.746 --> 16:31.231
I will not serve you.

16:33.864 --> 16:36.066
Your heart is not in your words.

16:36.600 --> 16:38.389
You will stand beside me.

16:39.014 --> 16:41.700
A testament to my power, here.

16:42.204 --> 16:44.417
My bodyguard will need a weapon.

16:45.750 --> 16:48.603
And you need not worry
about your friends.

16:49.025 --> 16:50.645
They will be quite safe.

17:10.363 --> 17:12.946
The queen has promised
once the other jedi is tamed,

17:13.347 --> 17:16.267
you will be mine, little skug.

17:25.577 --> 17:27.963
You'd better hope that
doesn't happen.

18:15.518 --> 18:16.700
My people...

18:17.358 --> 18:18.725
We have found them!

18:19.062 --> 18:20.632
Keep moving, skug.

18:26.096 --> 18:27.514
General Kenobi.

18:28.087 --> 18:30.941
You are the first Jedi
I have entertained

18:31.066 --> 18:33.541
at our education center.

18:34.280 --> 18:36.680
Few possess a jedi's resolve.

18:37.909 --> 18:41.740
And it is his strenght of will
that is my greatest ennemy.

18:55.675 --> 18:58.206
Now that i have your attention, Jedi.

18:58.681 --> 19:02.360
Be aware that it will
not be you who suffers,

19:02.485 --> 19:04.706
should you defy me.

19:14.088 --> 19:16.467
You were once a slave, weren't you.

19:16.940 --> 19:18.982
What makes you think I was a slave?

19:19.418 --> 19:21.832
The noble selflessness in your eyes.

19:22.372 --> 19:26.051
And your commitment to the service
of something greater than yourself.

19:26.321 --> 19:27.756
You're a Jedi.

19:27.881 --> 19:29.494
The grand Republic.

19:29.619 --> 19:31.085
Even your friends.

19:31.499 --> 19:33.608
I don't see commitment at slavery.

19:33.733 --> 19:34.807
It is.

19:34.932 --> 19:37.119
When it comes
at the cost of yourself.

19:38.199 --> 19:39.836
What you could be.

19:40.123 --> 19:42.116
With you willingly beside me,

19:42.453 --> 19:45.018
there is nothing
we could not accomplish.

19:45.143 --> 19:46.791
We are nothing.

19:47.213 --> 19:48.715
You have all the power.

20:13.421 --> 20:15.216
What if i freed your friends?

20:15.739 --> 20:17.242
Would you promise to stay?

20:17.367 --> 20:18.883
Commit to serving me?

20:20.845 --> 20:24.042
If a Jedi as noble as you,
gave his word.

20:24.645 --> 20:26.602
I think you might keep it.

20:26.957 --> 20:28.476
I don't trust you.

20:29.067 --> 20:31.294
Have I been anything but honest?

20:31.572 --> 20:33.969
I have no reason to lie.
I am who I am.

20:34.629 --> 20:35.608
It is you.

20:35.929 --> 20:38.111
You are the complicated one.

20:38.511 --> 20:40.199
Now, Master Skywalker,

20:40.570 --> 20:43.608
The future of your friends
lays in your hands.

20:44.327 --> 20:45.962
