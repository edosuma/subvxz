01:47.940 --> 01:48.940
Come on.

02:24.060 --> 02:25.060
All rise.

03:19.460 --> 03:23.020
Well done.
Another day nearer retirement.

03:25.460 --> 03:27.220
A few of us are off to
the pub to celebrate.

03:27.220 --> 03:28.380
Fancy it?

03:28.380 --> 03:30.460
Not tonight. Not tonight.

03:30.460 --> 03:32.740
You can't deal with the
general public every day

03:32.740 --> 03:36.300
and not drink.
That's how fellas wind up going crazy

03:36.300 --> 03:38.940
with automatic weapons
in shopping centres.

03:38.940 --> 03:40.020
I do drink.

03:40.020 --> 03:41.700
Just not with your workmates?

03:41.700 --> 03:43.860
Just not tonight.

03:45.260 --> 03:46.300
I made a promise.

04:05.220 --> 04:07.820
Is that me done?
That's all the appointments.

04:07.820 --> 04:09.660
Great, it's a big night tonight.

04:09.660 --> 04:11.100
Except...

04:11.100 --> 04:13.060
..he's been waiting about half an hour.

04:14.180 --> 04:15.540
He'll only see you.

04:27.900 --> 04:28.900
How many?

04:44.540 --> 04:45.580
You'll live.

04:48.580 --> 04:51.100
Why didn't you turn up to
see the doctor yesterday?

04:53.300 --> 04:54.740
I was ill.

04:54.740 --> 04:58.780
William, act like a victim and
you'll get treated like one.

05:03.700 --> 05:04.940
What do you want me to do?

05:13.860 --> 05:14.860
Come here.

06:10.540 --> 06:11.540
Hello?

06:15.420 --> 06:18.060
The water is what we use
to make the tempura batter

06:18.060 --> 06:21.420
so the air bubbles and it gives
it a really crisp texture...

06:26.580 --> 06:27.580
Rebecca?

06:40.740 --> 06:41.820
Jess?

06:56.300 --> 06:57.420
Rebecca?

07:14.100 --> 07:17.700
Got you! Happy Halloween, you monsters!

07:23.740 --> 07:25.900
Look! There's one, Daddy! Go on.

07:27.420 --> 07:29.140
Are we having a drink later?

07:29.140 --> 07:30.780
I can meet you last thing, maybe.

07:30.780 --> 07:33.820
Princess wants to give
out sweets at home.

07:33.820 --> 07:35.420
Trick or treat? Happy Halloween!

07:35.420 --> 07:37.780
Oh, this is a lovely costume,
did you make it yourself?

07:37.780 --> 07:39.100
Yes. Oh, that's nice.

07:39.100 --> 07:40.780
All right, mate, I've got this.

07:40.780 --> 07:43.180
Take some sweeties.
How you doing, all right?

07:43.180 --> 07:44.860
Hiya. Have you had some sweets?

07:44.860 --> 07:46.620
Oh, yeah.
She's got such a lovely costume.

07:46.620 --> 07:50.180
Yeah, it's good, isn't it?
Have you had many kids in, or...?

07:50.180 --> 07:51.620
Have you got any yourself, or...?

07:51.620 --> 07:54.860
All right, how's it going?
All right? Look at that costume!

07:58.460 --> 07:59.620
What do you think?

07:59.620 --> 08:02.060
Not as scary as usual.

08:02.060 --> 08:03.820
You know, I don't agree with Halloween.

08:03.820 --> 08:05.500
Stop eating the kids' sweets, then!

08:05.500 --> 08:07.140
What don't you agree with, Lenny?

08:07.140 --> 08:09.700
It's all a bit American now, isn't it?

08:09.700 --> 08:12.820
What's wrong with good old-fashioned
tapping the door and running away?

08:12.820 --> 08:14.220
Is that what you did at Halloween?

08:14.220 --> 08:16.060
That's what we did most nights.

08:17.180 --> 08:20.740
Vampire victims!
Come on! You too, mask on!

08:22.660 --> 08:26.180
OK. OK, OK, hold on, son!
Right, let's go.

08:26.180 --> 08:27.620
I'm meeting Nicki for a drink.

08:27.620 --> 08:29.020
Come down later if you like.

08:30.100 --> 08:32.940
I want to enjoy tonight with him.

08:32.940 --> 08:34.700
Yeah.

08:34.700 --> 08:36.980
So his mates want to know
if he can go with them.

08:38.220 --> 08:40.020
Can I, Mum?

08:40.020 --> 08:42.020
I'm sorry, love, no.

08:44.740 --> 08:46.780
Why not?

08:46.780 --> 08:49.020
Because you're too young.

08:49.020 --> 08:50.820
I mean, I'm in the same year as them!

08:52.620 --> 08:54.460
Well, I'm not their mum.

08:54.460 --> 08:56.220
Ally C's dad is going with them.

09:00.140 --> 09:02.620
If you stay here, everyone comes to us.

09:02.620 --> 09:05.820
That's what the pumpkin's for, remember?

09:05.820 --> 09:06.860
Mum...

09:08.100 --> 09:10.380
No, Ben, I'm sorry.

09:10.380 --> 09:11.380
Mum, but... No!

09:13.460 --> 09:14.860
Come on, pal.

09:14.860 --> 09:17.540
We'll tell them that Danny
wants to take you out later.

09:25.060 --> 09:28.340
I'll see you later, OK?
Have a nice night.

09:39.100 --> 09:41.020
You didn't come trick or treating

09:41.020 --> 09:42.940
with my six-year-old in order to meet
women, did you?

09:42.940 --> 09:46.460
What? I volunteer because you
can't interact with people,

09:46.460 --> 09:48.060
and this is the thanks I get?

09:48.060 --> 09:50.900
If you'd get your wife to throw me
some leads off that website of hers.

09:50.900 --> 09:53.620
It's not a website,
it's a forum for local mothers.

09:53.620 --> 09:55.940
Yeah? I need mothering.

09:55.940 --> 09:57.060
You need monitoring.

10:08.780 --> 10:11.300
Trick or treat?

10:17.820 --> 10:18.860
Goodbye!

10:26.660 --> 10:28.100
Let me just get my daughter.

11:02.140 --> 11:04.660
Call the diet of Her Majesty's Advocate

11:04.660 --> 11:07.220
against Anna Dean.

11:07.220 --> 11:08.780
Come forward, please, Mrs Dean.

11:21.860 --> 11:23.420
Are you Anna Dean?

11:23.420 --> 11:24.900
I am.

11:24.900 --> 11:25.940
Have a seat.

11:28.860 --> 11:30.980
The indictment reads as follows.

11:30.980 --> 11:35.260
On 31st October, 2017, at Kim's Cafe,

11:35.260 --> 11:39.780
Lothian Road, Edinburgh,
you did incite others, meantime unknown,

11:39.780 --> 11:44.060
to murder Craig Andrew
Myers, aged 28 years,

11:44.060 --> 11:46.500
of Tomlin Road, Port Glasgow.

12:09.020 --> 12:10.100
All done, boss.

12:10.100 --> 12:11.180
Right, thanks.

12:19.580 --> 12:20.620
Mrs Myers?

12:24.780 --> 12:25.820
And who's this?

12:28.100 --> 12:29.140
This is Jessica.

12:31.820 --> 12:32.860
No, I meant this.

12:33.820 --> 12:35.460
Oscar. Oscar?

12:37.060 --> 12:40.340
I'm DI Grover, Steven.

12:40.340 --> 12:44.380
I have to get to the hospital.
We'll take you shortly.

12:44.380 --> 12:49.220
It may be best if Jessica
stays with someone tonight.

12:49.220 --> 12:52.100
Do you or your husband
have any relatives nearby?

12:53.620 --> 12:54.660
No.

12:56.820 --> 13:00.220
Um, friends... Friends
from school that I can call.

14:30.380 --> 14:31.420
Grover.

14:31.420 --> 14:32.980
It's Rebecca Myers.

14:32.980 --> 14:35.780
People are saying Craig's
Eddie J Turner. Eddie J Turner?

14:35.780 --> 14:39.300
They're saying Craig isn't Craig!
They're saying he's a child killer.

14:40.300 --> 14:41.780
It's got thousands of likes!

14:44.580 --> 14:46.180
There's a photo of him, and our address,

14:46.180 --> 14:49.220
and it's already been shared thousands
of times. You have to do something!

14:49.220 --> 14:51.380
Rebecca, Rebecca,
I need you to stay calm, OK?

14:51.380 --> 14:53.540
People keep texting me and phoning me.

14:55.060 --> 14:56.460
I'm scared.

14:56.460 --> 15:00.220
Don't answer the phone. Don't even look
at the messages. Is Craig awake yet?

15:00.220 --> 15:03.740
No, but he's waking up.
What am I going to say to him?

15:03.740 --> 15:05.940
Nothing until I get there.
I'm on my way.

15:37.620 --> 15:38.860
Do you know where you are?

15:41.420 --> 15:43.180
Hospital. Mm-hm.

15:43.180 --> 15:44.860
And do you know what your name is?

15:50.100 --> 15:52.100
Craig.

15:52.100 --> 15:53.140
Craig Myers.

15:57.660 --> 15:58.740
Hey, you!

15:59.820 --> 16:01.420
Jess?

16:01.420 --> 16:03.740
She's fine. We're both fine.

16:06.140 --> 16:08.140
Unlike you, Humpty Dumpty!

16:10.500 --> 16:11.540
I love you.

16:13.620 --> 16:16.660
I love you too. So much!

16:23.220 --> 16:26.740
Why...? Who...?

16:26.740 --> 16:27.740
I don't know.

16:29.020 --> 16:30.300
It's OK, it's all right.

16:30.300 --> 16:31.340
Sh-sh-sh-sh.

16:40.700 --> 16:41.780
Thank you. OK.

16:44.500 --> 16:45.500
Hi.

16:47.420 --> 16:49.180
Hi, Craig, I'm DI Grover.

16:52.100 --> 16:53.420
Did you mention anything?

16:57.060 --> 16:59.580
Craig, do you recognise
the name Liam Graham?

17:03.380 --> 17:05.819
I don't know. Why?

17:05.819 --> 17:08.260
He was murdered in Edinburgh in 2003.

17:08.260 --> 17:09.460
He was nine years old.

17:12.260 --> 17:13.619
I think I remember.

17:14.780 --> 17:18.140
Turned out he was killed by
a boy only four years older.

17:18.140 --> 17:19.780
No motive, no explanation.

17:19.780 --> 17:22.020
Caused quite a sensation
when he was caught.

17:24.020 --> 17:28.780
He pleaded guilty and the sentence
was delivered in closed court.

17:28.780 --> 17:34.220
His face was never made public,
but his name was leaked by mistake.

17:36.300 --> 17:37.700
Eddie J Turner?

17:41.180 --> 17:43.300
He got a life sentence with a
punishment part of seven years.

17:43.300 --> 17:45.420
He was released in 2010.

17:45.420 --> 17:46.740
You must remember that.

17:48.180 --> 17:50.620
Well, just cos there
was a lot of publicity,

17:50.620 --> 17:52.980
there was a campaign
to keep him locked up.

17:52.980 --> 17:55.660
Death threats were made
and the court granted him

17:55.660 --> 17:58.380
lifelong anonymity under
Article 8. I don't...

17:58.380 --> 18:02.420
Someone put your name and picture on the
internet, saying you're Eddie J Turner.

18:08.140 --> 18:10.740
But... why would they do that?

18:12.260 --> 18:16.100
We're investigating that,
alongside the attack.

18:16.100 --> 18:18.860
Can you think of anyone that
holds a grudge against you?

18:23.180 --> 18:25.500
The attacker didn't say anything?

18:25.500 --> 18:26.500
Not that I can...

18:30.940 --> 18:32.060
Do people believe it?

18:41.780 --> 18:42.780
Look.

18:46.140 --> 18:51.780
Why have "DON'T LET EVIL LIVE" all in
caps, and "near our kids" in lower case?

18:52.780 --> 18:55.820
I heard Turner got moved to Wales.

18:55.820 --> 18:58.380
Cos it's an instruction.

18:58.380 --> 19:00.820
Get a body on the door of
Craig Myers' hospital room.

19:00.820 --> 19:02.220
And talk to Cybercrime.

19:02.220 --> 19:04.580
Will I get uniform on
the costume hire stuff?

19:04.580 --> 19:06.620
Yeah, but the priority is getting that
offline

19:06.620 --> 19:08.660
and finding out where it came from.

19:31.100 --> 19:32.860
Sorry to get you in so early, boss.

19:32.860 --> 19:35.540
Have you been to see this Myers?

19:35.540 --> 19:38.700
Yeah, he's in a bad way.
Pretty bewildered by the whole thing.

19:38.700 --> 19:40.100
Right, but could it be him?

19:41.420 --> 19:43.100
Well, he's the right age.

19:43.100 --> 19:46.700
From a Protected Persons point
of view, Port Glasgow fits.

19:46.700 --> 19:48.340
Does it look like him?

19:48.340 --> 19:50.940
There was only that one picture
of Turner as a kid, and it was

19:50.940 --> 19:52.780
so bad it could have been anyone.

19:52.780 --> 19:55.900
The thing is, it doesn't
really matter, does it?

19:55.900 --> 19:57.800
No, no, no, no, you're right,

19:57.800 --> 19:59.700
I mean, we have got the Police
Federation quiz to organise.

19:59.700 --> 20:01.540
What I mean is,

20:01.540 --> 20:04.260
a man has been seriously injured
as a direct result of that message.

20:04.260 --> 20:08.380
His past is only relevant in
terms of investigating that, right?

20:08.380 --> 20:10.140
They should never have let him out.

20:11.460 --> 20:12.660
Did you work on the case?

20:14.020 --> 20:15.300
No.

20:15.300 --> 20:17.780
No, but I saw the photos of
the wee boy's body, so...

20:21.820 --> 20:24.900
We won't get anything out of the PPU.
I need to make some calls.

20:24.900 --> 20:28.940
You brief the comms team and
then warn Liam Graham's family.

20:28.940 --> 20:31.260
The media don't need an excuse
as good as the Grim Reaper

20:31.260 --> 20:34.940
delivering judgement door-to-door
to run an Eddie J Turner story.

20:44.100 --> 20:45.540
Come on, then!

20:45.540 --> 20:46.900
I don't want to!

20:46.900 --> 20:48.060
Why not?

20:48.060 --> 20:49.940
I'm doing this, Dad!

20:49.940 --> 20:54.140
They're not going anywhere.
Come on, this'll be good to keep.

20:54.140 --> 20:55.220
OK, then.

20:57.540 --> 20:58.860
Right, then.

20:58.860 --> 21:00.460
Here we go.

21:00.460 --> 21:02.260
Name?

21:02.260 --> 21:04.700
Liam. Liam Graham.

21:04.700 --> 21:05.820
Age?

21:05.820 --> 21:07.220
Nine.

21:07.220 --> 21:10.260
Er, OK, what else?

21:10.260 --> 21:11.940
What do you want to be when you grow up?

21:13.940 --> 21:16.300
Big. I want to be big.

21:18.060 --> 21:19.860
Mum? Mum?

21:55.900 --> 21:57.700
Hello.

21:57.700 --> 22:02.260
Mrs Graham... Dean, sorry, long night.

22:03.780 --> 22:05.700
DI Grover, this is DS Harvey.

22:05.700 --> 22:08.060
I'm sorry to bother you.

22:08.060 --> 22:09.180
I just wondered

22:09.180 --> 22:11.700
if anyone from the media been
in touch in the last 24 hours.

22:11.700 --> 22:12.740
About what?

22:14.580 --> 22:18.140
Well, there was an attack on a
man in Port Glasgow last night

22:18.140 --> 22:21.780
after he was accused online
of being Eddie J Turner.

22:24.940 --> 22:28.620
Keep a secret and you invite
people to try and guess it.

22:28.620 --> 22:31.220
It's not the first time, is it?

22:31.220 --> 22:35.500
No, it's the first time there's
been an actual physical attack

22:35.500 --> 22:37.780
after someone's been
identified as Turner.

22:37.780 --> 22:39.580
We have always said that, if you make
his name public,

22:39.580 --> 22:41.380
the innocent won't get accused.

22:41.380 --> 22:44.240
DI Grover didn't say the man was
innocent.

22:44.240 --> 22:47.100
So are you saying it's him?

22:47.100 --> 22:49.260
I'm certainly not
saying that. So it isn't?

22:51.740 --> 22:53.700
You know I couldn't
tell you, even if I knew.

22:53.700 --> 22:55.220
And you don't?

22:55.220 --> 22:56.340
Craig Myers?

22:56.340 --> 22:58.500
If I looked in his eyes, I'd know.

22:59.900 --> 23:01.060
Is he badly hurt?

23:03.540 --> 23:04.580
Yes.

23:05.980 --> 23:06.980
But he's alive?

23:11.300 --> 23:14.100
As you know, the media
can't publish names or faces,

23:14.100 --> 23:16.540
but they'll get wind of this.
We'll speak to your ex-husband

23:16.540 --> 23:19.380
in prison, but it's you
that's likely to get the calls.

23:19.380 --> 23:20.380
I hope so.

23:22.020 --> 23:23.820
I don't ever want people to forget.

23:38.740 --> 23:39.780
We'll wait.

23:40.780 --> 23:42.540
I'm a law student.

23:42.540 --> 23:44.540
Right.

23:44.540 --> 23:46.420
I'm a policeman.

23:46.420 --> 23:49.580
I'd like to be here when
you speak with my mum.

23:49.580 --> 23:52.740
This is a friendly visit but, of course,
it's well within your rights... I know.

24:11.860 --> 24:12.980
What's up?

24:12.980 --> 24:14.980
A guy in Port Glasgow's been attacked.

24:14.980 --> 24:16.380
They think it might be him.

24:17.780 --> 24:19.060
Is Anna OK?

24:19.060 --> 24:21.300
How did we not see it online?

24:21.300 --> 24:22.380
Do they know who did it?

24:23.820 --> 24:25.460
The police are here now. Come.

24:31.420 --> 24:33.060
I should go.

24:33.060 --> 24:34.060
Why?

24:35.260 --> 24:36.540
It's none of my business.

24:36.540 --> 24:38.020
Don't be daft, Danny!

24:38.020 --> 24:41.300
I'm on my way to work anyway.
I only stopped to say hello.

24:42.860 --> 24:43.900
I'll go.

24:51.500 --> 24:54.300
Crown Production Number 19.

24:54.300 --> 24:58.220
The original accusation that
Craig Myers is Eddie J Turner.

24:59.580 --> 25:01.220
Cybercrime worked through the night

25:01.220 --> 25:04.420
to trace the account used
to post the accusation.

25:04.420 --> 25:06.100
The e-mail address told us that

25:06.100 --> 25:09.340
the account had been
created using false details.

25:09.340 --> 25:11.140
It took us only a few
hours to establish that

25:11.140 --> 25:15.020
the password for the account that
had posted the accusation was Twinkle.

25:32.860 --> 25:33.860
Get a warrant.

25:41.340 --> 25:45.940
What's going on? Did I miss something?

25:45.940 --> 25:48.180
I'm going to need you to
come with us, Mrs Dean.

26:14.060 --> 26:16.180
I was going to get you some grapes,

26:16.180 --> 26:18.340
but there's never anything fresh, so...

26:20.980 --> 26:22.020
..I got you this.

26:25.620 --> 26:27.300
That's petrol stations for you.

26:35.780 --> 26:36.820
Shit!

26:40.980 --> 26:42.900
What are you going to do?

26:42.900 --> 26:45.540
I'm fine, Tom. It's fucking
everywhere! Thanks for asking.

26:45.540 --> 26:46.580
This is serious, man!

26:46.580 --> 26:50.220
It must be serious
- you didn't even look at that nurse.

26:57.340 --> 26:58.700
Yeah, I've already had her.

27:03.060 --> 27:06.380
Last I heard, Eddie J
Turner was living in Norfolk

27:06.380 --> 27:07.780
and was on Come Dine With Me.

27:21.820 --> 27:23.140
What are you going to do?

27:26.140 --> 27:27.180
Nothing.

27:30.380 --> 27:31.980
I haven't done anything wrong.

27:34.660 --> 27:38.180
But sometimes that
doesn't matter, does it?

27:43.740 --> 27:46.660
What is in the folder labelled Twinkle?

27:49.780 --> 27:50.780
No comment.

27:54.700 --> 27:57.660
The folder was copied from the
computer seized at your home address.

27:57.660 --> 27:59.260
Do you recognise it?

27:59.260 --> 28:00.260
No comment.

28:02.540 --> 28:06.100
In the folder labelled Twinkle,
there are 609 photos

28:06.100 --> 28:08.900
and movies of your son, Liam.

28:08.900 --> 28:10.540
After Liam's tragic death...

28:10.540 --> 28:11.900
No!

28:11.900 --> 28:14.700
Tragic makes it sound like
he contracted a rare disease

28:14.700 --> 28:16.420
and drifted away in his sleep.

28:16.420 --> 28:17.780
He didn't.

28:17.780 --> 28:19.860
He was tortured to death under a bridge

28:19.860 --> 28:24.180
and left there like a piece
of rubbish, all on his own!

28:24.180 --> 28:28.740
Since then, you have campaigned
for victims' rights, correct?

28:29.820 --> 28:32.380
There's a list of
initiatives, but it turns out

28:32.380 --> 28:35.220
they're more about winning votes
than actually helping people.

28:36.540 --> 28:42.220
So, would it be fair to say that
you feel dissatisfied by the way

28:42.220 --> 28:43.500
the law has treated you?

28:44.700 --> 28:46.780
Liam, not me.

28:46.780 --> 28:48.880
And has this dissatisfaction
ever tempted you

28:48.880 --> 28:50.980
to take the law into your own hands?

28:50.980 --> 28:52.180
Yes. Anna!

28:52.180 --> 28:55.340
Almost every day since June 22nd, 2003.

28:57.780 --> 28:59.020
And have you ever done so?

29:01.260 --> 29:02.500
No comment.

29:02.500 --> 29:07.820
Mrs Dean, you're being detained
on suspicion of a serious offence

29:07.820 --> 29:09.780
that can result in life imprisonment.

29:09.780 --> 29:13.140
Sentencing is way outside
your remit, Detective.

29:13.140 --> 29:14.860
Life?

29:14.860 --> 29:16.780
Life?!

29:16.780 --> 29:21.060
He killed a child and got sentenced
to seven years playing video games!

29:21.060 --> 29:22.140
Anna, please.

29:24.180 --> 29:26.180
Was Twinkle your pet name for Liam?

29:28.060 --> 29:29.980
Do you know what he did to Liam's body?

29:29.980 --> 29:31.060
Anna!

29:31.060 --> 29:34.820
I know there's a man in ICU with
potentially life-changing injuries.

29:34.820 --> 29:37.220
Right, then. Here we go.

29:37.220 --> 29:38.660
Name?

29:38.660 --> 29:40.780
Liam. Liam Graham.

29:40.780 --> 29:42.620
Age? Nine.

29:44.260 --> 29:45.860
He was small for his age.

29:45.860 --> 29:47.620
What do you want to be when you grow up?

29:47.620 --> 29:50.380
Big. I want to be big.

29:53.860 --> 29:55.340
I'm familiar with the case, Mrs Dean.

29:55.340 --> 29:58.540
He only went to get football stickers.

29:58.540 --> 30:01.140
I wouldn't have let him go,
but it was still light and the shop

30:01.140 --> 30:05.420
was just down the way. I thought
he must have bumped into some pals.

30:05.420 --> 30:07.060
Liam bought the stickers, and...

30:07.060 --> 30:11.100
That sick bastard even took
the stickers as a trophy!

30:11.100 --> 30:14.900
And was attacked on his
way home, as I've said.

30:14.900 --> 30:17.460
You're familiar with the case, I know.

30:18.940 --> 30:23.700
From what you've read and watched.
There was a lot of that at first.

30:25.060 --> 30:26.140
Then it stopped.

30:27.340 --> 30:31.380
He pleaded guilty, so there
was no trial, no explanation.

30:31.380 --> 30:35.180
I didn't even get to see him
receive that insult of a sentence!

30:35.180 --> 30:36.540
It was all just over!

30:37.780 --> 30:40.060
Except for Liam's dad
and his sister and me.

30:43.100 --> 30:46.460
So you resent the lack
of ongoing coverage?

30:46.460 --> 30:48.220
Really, Anna, I will stop this.

30:48.220 --> 30:52.500
You said at the house that you hoped
the media would get wind of the attack.

30:52.500 --> 30:53.860
Is that what's behind this?

30:53.860 --> 30:56.300
I've got a right to know where he is.

30:56.300 --> 30:57.940
Actually, no, I'm afraid you haven't.

30:57.940 --> 31:01.980
He killed my son and he was
given a new name and a new life.

31:01.980 --> 31:05.380
He could walk past me and my
family and we wouldn't even know.

31:05.380 --> 31:06.980
He could do anything.

31:06.980 --> 31:09.220
And he will because he's evil!

31:09.220 --> 31:10.300
Enough.

31:10.300 --> 31:14.860
Wherever Eddie J Turner is,
the terms of his licence prevent him

31:14.860 --> 31:17.460
from entering the City of Edinburgh.

31:17.460 --> 31:20.220
Good job we know he's such
a law-abiding citizen, then.

31:23.420 --> 31:26.140
Where and when did you first
hear the name Craig Myers?

31:29.820 --> 31:30.900
No comment.

31:30.900 --> 31:34.580
You used social media to instruct
someone to attack him, didn't you?

31:34.580 --> 31:37.220
No comment. Did you have any evidence?

31:37.220 --> 31:42.460
No, you made wild accusations
against an innocent man, right?

31:42.460 --> 31:44.460
We've barely begun looking into this.

31:44.460 --> 31:47.220
What will we find when
we examine your phone?

31:47.220 --> 31:48.460
I'm not the criminal!

31:48.460 --> 31:50.980
Do you know who attacked Craig Myers?

31:50.980 --> 31:53.700
No! But I'm glad they did!

31:53.700 --> 31:55.820
Anna! Now we stop!

32:09.020 --> 32:12.580
Hiya, you all right? Got you a sandwich.

32:12.580 --> 32:13.580
I'm not hungry.

32:14.940 --> 32:17.260
Leigh from the depot
called to see how you are.

32:17.260 --> 32:18.260
How or who?

32:23.740 --> 32:24.780
It's a joke.

32:27.060 --> 32:28.420
It was inappropriate.

32:28.420 --> 32:29.540
Sorry.

32:35.620 --> 32:36.660
What?

32:40.380 --> 32:41.420
Tell her.

32:44.580 --> 32:45.860
I remembered something.

32:47.300 --> 32:49.660
The guy
- he did speak to me.

32:51.300 --> 32:53.020
He whispered something in my ear.

32:55.940 --> 32:56.980
What did he say?

33:02.860 --> 33:05.300
"Evil can't live near our kids."

33:06.380 --> 33:10.100
The same words as in the message?
All right, thanks, Rebecca.

33:12.300 --> 33:15.100
At the time of the interview, DI Grover,

33:15.100 --> 33:17.580
why did you believe there to
be a link between the message

33:17.580 --> 33:21.020
and the attack, and therefore
reason to detain Mrs Dean?

33:21.020 --> 33:24.340
Because the attack happened
two hours after Mr Myers' name,

33:24.340 --> 33:26.420
address and picture
appeared on the internet.

33:26.420 --> 33:28.740
And those were your only grounds?

33:28.740 --> 33:30.860
There was also the way that
the message was written.

33:30.860 --> 33:35.540
Oh, yes, of course!
Lest we forget, the typographical style

33:35.540 --> 33:39.460
in which you discerned a
hidden exhortation to violence.

33:40.660 --> 33:42.260
Those were your grounds?

33:42.260 --> 33:45.380
Along with my judgement,
as an experienced police officer.

33:45.380 --> 33:49.780
It's perfectly normal to detain an
individual and then gather evidence.

33:49.780 --> 33:52.100
I had reasons to suspect Mrs Dean.

33:52.100 --> 33:54.940
Ah, well, it's your
reasons for suspecting her

33:54.940 --> 33:58.540
and your professional
judgement I'm interested in.

33:58.540 --> 34:01.520
Specifically, your attitude towards
women

34:01.520 --> 34:04.500
who dare to peak up for themselves.

34:06.140 --> 34:08.739
Isn't it the case that you've
been seconded from Edinburgh to

34:08.739 --> 34:13.020
Inverclyde due to an ongoing
investigation into your conduct?

34:13.020 --> 34:15.699
Objection, My Lady.
The question is entirely irrelevant.

34:15.699 --> 34:17.780
Move on, please, Mr Mishra.

34:20.540 --> 34:22.179
I used to sing it to Liam.

34:23.340 --> 34:25.300
Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star.

34:26.699 --> 34:30.100
He was a terrible sleeper to begin with.

34:30.100 --> 34:32.179
It was the only thing
that made him go off.

34:40.340 --> 34:41.420
What's keeping them?

34:47.179 --> 34:48.219
Hi.

34:49.900 --> 34:53.739
News on the artist formerly known
as Eddie J Turner and Mr Myers.

34:54.900 --> 34:56.020
Two different people.

34:56.020 --> 34:57.060
Definitely?

34:58.100 --> 34:59.540
The smoke's settled above Myers

34:59.540 --> 35:01.420
cos the fire could well be pretty local.

35:01.420 --> 35:04.340
So, for obvious reasons,
we need to handle this sensitively.

35:04.340 --> 35:05.460
What reasons?

35:05.460 --> 35:07.980
If Anna Dean accused an innocent
man of being a child killer...

35:07.980 --> 35:10.620
You did just hear the
sensitively part, Steven?

35:14.980 --> 35:17.780
The Crown Office has just
given me permission to charge.

35:17.780 --> 35:19.060
With?

35:19.060 --> 35:20.620
Incitement to murder.

35:20.620 --> 35:23.140
The Grim Reaper used almost
exactly the same words

35:23.140 --> 35:25.980
to Craig Myers as the
ones in the online post.

35:25.980 --> 35:27.340
That's a very serious charge.

35:27.340 --> 35:29.620
It's a very serious knife,
not fancy dress.

35:31.100 --> 35:32.620
It's what the Fiscal advised.

35:33.740 --> 35:34.860
How hard did you push?

35:38.340 --> 35:40.220
Anna Dean knows who did this.

35:40.220 --> 35:41.620
That's to be proved.

35:44.260 --> 35:46.380
Are we releasing a statement?

35:46.380 --> 35:49.180
No, it only gives the story oxygen.

35:49.180 --> 35:51.740
There'll be reporting
restrictions in place?

35:51.740 --> 35:54.220
On the grounds that we've
yet to arrest an attacker.

35:56.100 --> 35:59.100
OK, charge and release
Mrs Dean on an undertaking.

35:59.100 --> 36:02.140
Remind her of the consequences
if any of this gets out. Mm-hm.

36:02.140 --> 36:05.700
And sensitively, Steven, OK?

36:26.820 --> 36:30.580
We have made enquiries.
There are no grounds to believe that

36:30.580 --> 36:32.900
the man who was attacked
was your son's killer.

36:36.060 --> 36:38.020
Unless, of course, you know different.

36:42.180 --> 36:44.780
Up to this point, you have
been questioned under suspicion.

36:44.780 --> 36:49.180
You are now under arrest on a
charge of incitement to murder.

36:49.180 --> 36:51.700
I must caution you that you're
not obliged to say anything, but

36:51.700 --> 36:55.260
anything you do say will be written
down and may be used in evidence.

36:55.260 --> 36:59.420
I will ask the duty officer to release
you on an undertaking to appear...

37:42.500 --> 37:45.540
We appreciate your
understanding and co-operation.

37:45.540 --> 37:47.900
We're satisfied that it's a
case of mistaken identity.

37:47.900 --> 37:51.820
So hopefully things'll get
back to normal pretty quickly.

37:51.820 --> 37:54.300
Will there be a statement,
saying Craig isn't him?

37:54.300 --> 37:57.740
No, we want the story to
die as soon as possible.

37:57.740 --> 38:00.340
But we will be coming down
hard on anyone repeating

38:00.340 --> 38:02.860
the accusations, on or offline.

38:02.860 --> 38:03.860
Yeah, but... Don't.

38:57.020 --> 38:59.180
He's reading. I said goodnight.

39:00.740 --> 39:01.780
Here you go.

39:30.740 --> 39:32.540
Will someone please ask me?

39:35.220 --> 39:38.260
Why? We already know, don't we?

39:42.620 --> 39:44.740
Was it you who put the
message online, Anna?

39:48.820 --> 39:52.700
I couldn't tell any of you
anything or you'd be implicated.

39:53.780 --> 39:56.940
I know you're angry,
but you're going to be a lawyer.

39:56.940 --> 40:00.220
Did you know about the
attack before the police came?

40:00.220 --> 40:02.220
No. Do you know who did it?

40:02.220 --> 40:03.300
Of course she doesn't!

40:07.500 --> 40:09.580
I was told it's definitely him.

40:09.580 --> 40:10.740
But it's not!

40:10.740 --> 40:12.260
According to the police...

40:12.260 --> 40:13.820
Oh, Christ, Mum!

40:13.820 --> 40:15.220
What else are they going to say?

40:15.220 --> 40:16.220
Who told you?

40:17.780 --> 40:21.300
Please, tell me you didn't
trust Mo bloody Buckley!

40:21.300 --> 40:24.540
Any number of people would have
gladly have put it online for you!

40:24.540 --> 40:26.660
I know. So why didn't you let them?

40:26.660 --> 40:28.820
Because I'm his mother!

40:33.700 --> 40:34.980
I don't blame you, Anna.

40:45.260 --> 40:48.140
Do you know how much
I wanted to tell you?

40:48.140 --> 40:49.820
But you knew what I'd say.

40:49.820 --> 40:52.540
I'm trying to protect you.

40:52.540 --> 40:55.260
You can't always, Mum.
You know you can't.

40:56.220 --> 40:57.460
Where are you going?

40:57.460 --> 41:00.180
To e-mail uni to tell them that
I won't be at tomorrow's lecture

41:00.180 --> 41:04.340
because my criminal mother is at the
Sheriff Court, trying to get bail!

41:06.980 --> 41:08.300
No end to it, is there?

41:17.780 --> 41:19.420
My mother said you were trouble.

41:21.860 --> 41:23.300
She also said you could cook.

41:27.100 --> 41:30.140
This isn't me not sharing it with you.

41:30.140 --> 41:32.540
If the worst happens,
you have to be here for Ben.

41:33.820 --> 41:35.140
But it won't come to that.

42:27.300 --> 42:28.300
What changed?

42:29.620 --> 42:32.340
The ACC doesn't tend to share
that sort of thing with me.

42:32.340 --> 42:35.500
He just tends to tell me what
to do and I just tend to do it.

42:35.500 --> 42:36.500
You see the pattern?

42:38.580 --> 42:40.560
He felt the Fiscal you spoke to

42:40.560 --> 42:42.540
wasn't experienced enough to make such
a big decision.

42:42.540 --> 42:45.340
Bollocks! What's so bloody big about it?

42:45.340 --> 42:47.300
Incitement to murder is a big call.

42:47.300 --> 42:49.420
And you can see this is delicate.

42:50.980 --> 42:53.580
All I can see is that
the law has been broken.

42:53.580 --> 42:56.100
Nobody wants to criminalise a victim,

42:56.100 --> 42:58.300
especially not one people know.

42:58.300 --> 43:00.780
And, like it or not,
we need to consider public opinion.

43:00.780 --> 43:04.180
Public opinion' doesn't exist!
It was invented by the media.

43:04.180 --> 43:06.600
The bottom line is it's in everybody's
interests

43:06.600 --> 43:09.020
for this to just quietly go away.

43:09.020 --> 43:11.540
Unless it was your head
that was split in two.

43:11.540 --> 43:12.700
He'll get...

43:12.700 --> 43:15.420
Compensation? Christ!

43:15.420 --> 43:17.140
Boss, whoever did this,

43:17.140 --> 43:18.860
they didn't go to Craig Myers' house to
give him a hiding.

43:18.860 --> 43:23.340
They went there to try and kill him.
What if they try again?

43:23.340 --> 43:25.500
There's a six-year-old
girl living in that house.

43:25.500 --> 43:28.220
So let's just wait and see
what the Fiscals come back with.

43:28.220 --> 43:30.040
If Anna Dean walks because the Chief
Constable

43:30.040 --> 43:31.860
got spooked and called the Crown
Office...

43:31.860 --> 43:33.780
We're both too old for
conspiracy theories.

43:33.780 --> 43:36.460
Then we are basically
sanctioning vigilantism!

43:36.460 --> 43:39.500
You are already walking
a tightrope, Steven.

43:39.500 --> 43:41.820
Now would not be the best
time to start running.

43:43.220 --> 43:45.860
It's out of our hands now, OK?

43:54.140 --> 43:55.180
Bad news?

43:58.660 --> 43:59.780
We'll talk tomorrow.

44:02.580 --> 44:04.940
A few of us are going for
a drink, if you fancy it.

44:06.300 --> 44:08.260
You still haven't really met everyone.

44:12.900 --> 44:15.140
Thanks, but not tonight.

44:15.140 --> 44:16.180
Night.

44:57.460 --> 45:00.220
I only want to talk.
You can't be anywhere near me.

45:00.220 --> 45:02.220
Five minutes. Please, Cathy. No.

45:02.220 --> 45:04.540
Just tell them the truth. I said no!

45:08.500 --> 45:12.540
He still doesn't understand
that when a woman says no...

45:15.460 --> 45:17.100
..she means no.

45:56.980 --> 45:58.940
Daddy! Hello!

46:01.060 --> 46:04.100
Have you been good?
I've missed you so much!

46:04.100 --> 46:06.260
Oh! Oh!

46:28.220 --> 46:30.780
I spoke with Crown Counsel last night,

46:30.780 --> 46:33.340
and it seems they've changed their
position.

46:35.700 --> 46:39.740
Should we be willing to tender an
early guilty plea under Section 76,

46:39.740 --> 46:42.180
we'd receive the maximum
discount on sentence.

46:42.180 --> 46:43.820
Does that mean non-custodial?

46:43.820 --> 46:45.660
If we negotiate a soft plea

46:45.660 --> 46:49.180
and a watered-down narration now,
that's the implication, yeah.

46:49.180 --> 46:51.100
She'll walk away.

46:51.100 --> 46:52.900
And if she pleads not guilty?

46:52.900 --> 46:56.140
Then we go to trial,
Mr Myers gives evidence, and...

46:56.140 --> 46:58.540
Who knows? Aye. Who knows?

46:58.540 --> 47:01.300
Anna, I need you to tell
me what you want me to do.

47:05.140 --> 47:08.380
If this is so serious,
why are they willing to negotiate?

47:08.380 --> 47:10.860
Because they know what
you've been through.

47:10.860 --> 47:12.540
And because you're a pain in the arse

47:12.540 --> 47:15.060
and they're scared of public
opinion if you go to jail.

47:15.060 --> 47:17.980
Or because I'm too close to the truth.

47:21.100 --> 47:23.660
They've been lying to us for 15 years,
Lou.

47:23.660 --> 47:26.220
Why assume they're being honest now?

47:28.060 --> 47:30.620
What if Craig Myers is Eddie J Turner

47:30.620 --> 47:33.180
and this is our one chance to lift the
rock he's hiding under?

47:36.780 --> 47:39.140
You've been with us almost from the
start, Mr Mishra,

47:39.140 --> 47:41.500
you know what I've always wanted -

47:41.500 --> 47:44.040
for everyone to know who and where that
evil bastard is

47:44.040 --> 47:46.580
because he's still evil. I know he is.

47:49.060 --> 47:50.620
He never had to answer for it.

47:50.620 --> 47:53.340
He never had to stand up
in court and tell us - why?

47:53.340 --> 47:54.700
Why Liam?

47:54.700 --> 47:56.660
What about Ben?

47:56.660 --> 47:59.780
This is about Ben and every other kid.

47:59.780 --> 48:03.300
None of them are safe until
everyone knows where Turner is.

48:03.300 --> 48:06.260
It's worth pointing out, Anna,
that if you do decide to take this

48:06.260 --> 48:10.340
to trial, there'll be no going
back for Mr Myers, whoever he is.

48:12.580 --> 48:15.740
If you plead not guilty, Mum,
there's no going back for any of us.

48:21.180 --> 48:23.620
Can I have some time to
consult with Anna, please?

48:40.740 --> 48:42.900
Now everything can get
back to how it was, hm?

48:46.060 --> 48:50.460
I keep thinking, what if Jess
had answered the door with me?

49:12.260 --> 49:14.020
I just wanted to update you.

49:14.020 --> 49:18.980
It can't be reported,
but the accused is Anna Dean.

49:19.740 --> 49:22.180
Liam Graham's mother.

49:22.180 --> 49:23.580
She posted the picture?

49:23.580 --> 49:26.740
That has to be proven,
if we get that far.

49:26.740 --> 49:28.540
She's been granted
bail on condition that

49:28.540 --> 49:31.380
she stays out of Port Glasgow and
makes no attempt to contact you.

49:31.380 --> 49:33.260
Sorry, what do you mean,
if we get that far?

49:33.260 --> 49:36.220
There's been some... dialogue.

49:36.220 --> 49:37.740
There's a question mark over

49:37.740 --> 49:40.940
whether or not the case will go to
trial. A lot depends on her plea.

49:40.940 --> 49:42.500
He nearly died!

49:42.500 --> 49:44.380
I know.

49:44.380 --> 49:47.060
Let's just wait and see what happens.

49:49.660 --> 49:54.060
I suppose, if there's no trial,
it should go away quicker, right?

49:54.060 --> 49:57.220
Why me? Did she answer that?

49:58.420 --> 49:59.420
No.

50:00.780 --> 50:05.180
I'm a parent and I feel for her, but...

50:07.220 --> 50:08.620
..why do this to me?

50:13.300 --> 50:14.340
Mrs Myers?

50:28.460 --> 50:30.980
And at that point,
did things return to normal?

50:33.740 --> 50:34.780
Mrs Myers?

50:36.620 --> 50:38.540
Sorry. It's OK.

50:38.540 --> 50:40.860
I know it's been a
difficult time for you.

50:40.860 --> 50:44.540
I asked you whether,
after DI Grover's assurances,

50:44.540 --> 50:47.620
did things return to normal
for you and your family?

50:47.620 --> 50:51.820
No. Not that DI Grover lied.

50:52.860 --> 50:53.900
He didn't know.

50:57.140 --> 50:58.140
None of us did.

51:26.780 --> 51:27.900
You all right?

51:32.740 --> 51:33.780
What happened?

51:34.940 --> 51:38.260
Anna has instructed me to
tender a plea of not guilty.

51:38.260 --> 51:39.940
The case will go to trial.

51:41.780 --> 51:43.180
Mrs Myers,

51:43.180 --> 51:46.460
did you see the attacker
whisper to your husband?

51:48.100 --> 51:51.140
No, I was upstairs. The attack
was over before I heard anything.

51:51.140 --> 51:53.740
So, all you know is what
your husband has told you?

51:55.540 --> 51:57.740
How well do you know
your husband, Mrs Myers?

51:59.740 --> 52:02.260
How well does anyone
know anyone in the end?

52:02.260 --> 52:04.140
Well, generally speaking,

52:04.140 --> 52:08.020
married couples tend to share
everything with each other.

52:08.020 --> 52:10.660
I don't know. I'm no expert.

52:10.660 --> 52:13.580
So you don't share everything?

52:13.580 --> 52:14.900
Is this relevant?

52:14.900 --> 52:16.700
With respect, Mrs Myers,

52:16.700 --> 52:19.100
we won't know that until
you answer the question.

52:26.100 --> 52:29.340
We made a kind of agreement...

52:30.460 --> 52:33.900
..that anything that happened
before we met doesn't matter.

52:35.580 --> 52:36.780
I see.

52:36.780 --> 52:37.820
Because?

52:39.700 --> 52:41.460
We both come from...

52:43.940 --> 52:48.340
..not particularly happy backgrounds,

52:48.340 --> 52:50.860
and neither of our
families are around, so...

52:53.460 --> 52:55.420
..we agreed there's no
point in looking back.

52:55.420 --> 53:00.140
And... we decided to
concentrate on looking forward

53:00.140 --> 53:02.460
and building a proper family of our own.

53:02.460 --> 53:04.020
That's all.

53:04.020 --> 53:08.620
Since you've been together, then,
have there been any occasions when

53:08.620 --> 53:12.900
your husband hasn't been honest
with you about something significant?

53:24.380 --> 53:25.780
Yes, but I...

53:25.780 --> 53:28.140
Thank you, Mrs Myers.

53:30.740 --> 53:32.460
Thank you, Mrs Myers.

53:33.420 --> 53:36.380
Court will reconvene
at 10 a.m. tomorrow.

53:42.300 --> 53:44.180
This is how we get the truth.

53:46.260 --> 53:47.740
This is how we get him.

54:10.300 --> 54:12.660
I thought they'd get to him today.

54:12.660 --> 54:14.380
Hm. Definitely tomorrow.

54:46.100 --> 54:48.380
The police are saying it's not him.

54:48.380 --> 54:51.580
I need proof that Craig
Myers is Eddie J Turner.

54:52.740 --> 54:54.700
You do have proof?

54:54.700 --> 54:58.300
I was in the process of getting
it when you decided to go global.

55:04.340 --> 55:07.460
The Crown's position is
that it doesn't matter

55:07.460 --> 55:09.420
whether Craig is Eddie J Turner or not.

55:09.420 --> 55:10.540
It matters to me.

55:18.300 --> 55:23.260
You know your mum's amazing,
don't you? I mean, really amazing.

55:30.300 --> 55:34.500
We all understand why you might
feel an affinity with Craig Myers,

55:34.500 --> 55:35.860
but there's no conspiracy.

55:37.220 --> 55:38.820
Just remember who the victim is.

55:46.580 --> 55:49.140
Craig Myers is Eddie J Turner.

55:49.140 --> 55:50.820
And when he stands up in court

55:50.820 --> 55:54.100
and falls to pieces in front of
everyone, he'll prove it himself!

56:01.780 --> 56:03.620
Could you tell us your name, please?

56:06.660 --> 56:08.500
My name is Craig Andrew Myers.
