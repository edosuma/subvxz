11:38.964 --> 11:40.366
{\an3}I GOT TO GO DROP SOME PRESENTS

YOU'RE KIDDING, RIGHT?

12:04.857 --> 12:06.725
WELL, SANTA,

{\an3}LOOK, SANTA,
MRS. CLAUS, ELVES--

12:18.804 --> 12:20.272
WE PREFER THE TERM

12:22.908 --> 12:24.543
SO DO I.

12:24.610 --> 12:26.378
THERE'S BEEN
A HUGE MISUNDERSTANDING,

12:26.445 --> 12:28.013
SO I SUGGEST YOU ALL HEAD BACK
TO THE NORTH POLE

12:28.080 --> 12:29.281

FOR NEXT CHRISTMAS,

{\an1}BUT BECAUSE OF YOUR
"MAGIC MAILMEN" FRIENDS,

12:39.558 --> 12:41.560
{\an1}NO ONE WANTS ME AROUND
ANYMORE.

12:50.803 --> 12:52.905
WHO DIDN'T GET WHAT THEY WANTED
FOR CHRISTMAS.

12:52.972 --> 12:56.342
INSTEAD OF FOCUSING
ON WHAT YOU DIDN'T GET, TIMMY,

12:56.408 --> 13:00.379
YOU SHOULD BE HAPPY
WITH WHAT YOU ALREADY HAVE.

13:00.446 --> 13:02.148
YOU STAY OUT OF THIS.

13:02.214 --> 13:04.283
AND WHY DIDN'T YOU
JUST GIVE ME A SLED?

13:04.350 --> 13:06.519
NONE OF THIS WOULD HAVE HAPPENED
IF YOU'D JUST GIVEN ME A SLED.
