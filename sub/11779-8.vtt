narrator: TEN ARTISTS WERE LEFT
IN THE COMPETITION.

00:07.048 --> 00:09.467
- THIS WEEK,
TWO ARTISTS WILL BE GOING HOME.

00:09.551 --> 00:13.555
- NO [bleep] WAY.

00:13.638 --> 00:15.181
- DOUBLE-ELIMINATING PEOPLE
LEFT AND RIGHT.

00:15.265 --> 00:17.434
- YOU'VE COME UP SHY
IN A COUPLE OF CHALLENGES.

00:17.517 --> 00:18.601
- DON'T ASSUME
THAT I'M NOT IN THIS.

00:18.685 --> 00:21.563
NOW THAT SCOTT AND MATTI HAVE
SET A FIRE UNDER MY ASS,

00:21.646 --> 00:23.815

HIS OPPONENTS

00:31.698 --> 00:33.658

00:36.035 --> 00:37.078
- YOUR PIECE
WAS NOT AS GOOD AS MINE.

00:37.162 --> 00:40.123
THEY FIND THE MOST PERFECT
[bleep] IN YOUR TATTOO.

00:40.206 --> 00:41.708
- THEY ALL TELL ME THINGS WRONG
WITH MY TATTOO,

00:41.791 --> 00:42.834
AND I'LL BE LIKE...
- THEY DIDN'T.

00:42.917 --> 00:45.628

narrator: THE PRESSURE
OF THE COMPETITION

00:47.380 --> 00:48.840
PUSHED KYLE
TO HIS BREAKING POINT.

00:48.923 --> 00:51.050
- YOU'RE NOT
A VERSATILE ARTIST.

00:51.134 --> 00:52.010
- I LIKE THE TATTOO.

00:52.093 --> 00:52.802
- YOU'RE COMPLETELY INSANE.

00:52.886 --> 00:56.473
- I CANNOT STAND
THIS TATTOO.

00:56.556 --> 00:58.308
- [bleep] THEM
PIECES OF [bleep].

00:58.391 --> 01:00.351
- WHO GIVES A [bleep]
ABOUT WHAT THE JUDGES WANT?

01:00.435 --> 01:01.936
- I'M TATTOOING
FOUR OF THOSE MOTHER[bleep],

01:02.020 --> 01:02.979
AND MY WORK HAS GOTTEN
SO MUCH WORSE.

01:03.062 --> 01:06.024

HIS [bleep] MIND IN HERE.

01:07.484 --> 01:10.653
KING RUCK, MELISSA, JIM,
AND GENTLE JAY

01:10.737 --> 01:12.030
WERE THE BOTTOM FOUR.

01:12.113 --> 01:13.406
- ANYBODY SHOULD'VE BEEN ABLE

01:13.490 --> 01:14.949
TO KNOCK IT
OUT OF THE GODDAMN PARK.

01:15.033 --> 01:16.201
- SHE WAS A [bleep].

01:16.284 --> 01:18.495
- YOU CANNOT TELL ME
ABOUT A [bleep] CANVAS.

01:18.578 --> 01:20.663
- THIS TATTOO WAS A FAIL.

01:20.747 --> 01:23.833
- KING RUCK AND JIM,

01:23.917 --> 01:26.544
YOU DO NOT HAVE WHAT IT TAKES
TO BE INK MASTER.

01:28.546 --> 01:30.173
narrator: EIGHT ARTISTS REMAIN.

01:30.256 --> 01:34.177
BUT ONLY ONE WILL EARN
A $100,000 PRIZE

02:50.628 --> 02:52.630
- AND I'D BE THE FIRST TO SAY
THEY MENTIONED KYLE BY NAME.

02:52.714 --> 02:55.675
NUNEZ MADE A SPECIFIC POINT
OF SAYING "KYLE DUNBAR

02:55.758 --> 02:58.553
SHOULD'VE BEEN DOWN HERE."

02:58.636 --> 03:01.014

THAT WERE DONE TODAY

03:01.097 --> 03:03.016
THAT WERE NOT GOOD.

TELL KYLE DUNBAR THAT
HE SHOULD'VE BEEN DOWN HERE,

03:15.653 --> 03:17.780
WHEN YOU CAN SEE LIGHT
AT THE END OF THE TUNNEL.

03:17.864 --> 03:19.324

THE WAY YOU FEEL RIGHT NOW

03:19.407 --> 03:20.992
IS GOING TO AFFECT YOU
THROUGH THE REST OF THIS, MAN?

05:17.567 --> 05:19.902
I DON'T NEED TO BE ANYBODY'S
[bleep] PUNCHING BAG. WHAT?

05:19.986 --> 05:21.487

05:21.571 --> 05:22.905
- RELAX.
- GUYS, RELAX.

05:22.989 --> 05:25.283
- YOU NEED TO RELAX, MAN.
- I'M [bleep] TIRED OF YOU.

05:25.366 --> 05:27.452
- BUT YOU CAME
TO A [bleep] SHOW.

05:27.535 --> 05:28.619
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

05:28.703 --> 05:30.455
- UH, I THOUGHT THERE WAS
A CHANCE I WOULD WIN.

05:30.538 --> 05:34.334
- ARE YOU DOING BETTER THAN
[bleep] SCOTT OR SAUSAGE?

05:36.502 --> 05:38.921
WE'RE NOT GONNA FIGHT.
I KNOW YOU'RE SUCKING IT UP,

05:39.005 --> 05:40.757
BUT WE'RE NOT GONNA FIGHT.
OVER THIS?

05:40.840 --> 05:42.341
- I JUST WANT TO CALL YOU
A BITCH.

05:42.425 --> 05:43.926
- I'M GONNA CALL YOU
A BITCH BACK,

05:44.010 --> 05:47.680
BUT WE'RE STILL
NOT GONNA FIGHT OVER--

05:47.764 --> 05:48.848
THIS IS STUPID.

05:48.931 --> 05:51.559
YOU'RE FIGHTING
OVER A TATTOO?

05:51.642 --> 05:53.644
- CLEARLY, NO ONE'S GONNA LET
ANYBODY FIGHT.

05:53.728 --> 05:55.646
IT'S NOT GONNA SETTLE
DIFFERENCES.

06:00.485 --> 06:02.737
- I'M THE ONE THAT CALLED HIM
INSANE, AND HE'S MAD AT NUNEZ.

06:02.820 --> 06:05.573
- HE'S MAKING INSANE CHOICES,
AND HE ADMITS IT HIMSELF.

06:05.656 --> 06:07.617
THIS ISN'T
A [bleep] FLUFF SHOW.

06:07.700 --> 06:11.120
EVERYBODY'S GETTING BEAT UP,
MAN.

06:11.204 --> 06:12.622
- HOPEFULLY THIS WHOLE DAY
DOESN'T GET [bleep]-CANNED, MAN.

06:12.705 --> 06:15.958
- DUDE, EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE,
MEN NEED TO PUNCH EACH OTHER.

06:16.042 --> 06:19.796
THAT'S JUST
THE WAY OF THE WORLD, BRO.

06:26.511 --> 06:28.346
- ALL RIGHT, GUYS,
BEFORE WE MOVE ON,

06:28.429 --> 06:31.682
ANYBODY HAVE ANYTHING
THEY'D LIKE TO ADDRESS?

06:31.766 --> 06:33.643
- IS KYLE COMING BACK?

06:33.726 --> 06:35.978
- KYLE IS NOT COMING BACK.

06:36.062 --> 06:38.940
HE'S OUT OF THE COMPETITION.

06:39.023 --> 06:41.651
{\an8}- HOLY [bleep].

06:41.734 --> 06:43.486
{\an8}- I'M SURPRISED.

06:43.569 --> 06:44.654
- WHAT'S IMPORTANT

06:44.737 --> 06:46.614
IS THAT THE SEVEN OF YOU
HAVE DECIDED TO COMPETE.

06:46.697 --> 06:50.785
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE HERE TO DO.
IS THAT GOOD WITH YOU GUYS?

06:50.868 --> 06:52.870
ALL RIGHT, SO WE'RE GONNA GET
INTO THIS FLASH CHALLENGE.

06:52.954 --> 06:56.624
THIS WEEK,
WE'RE TESTING NEGATIVE SPACE.

06:56.707 --> 07:01.045
{\an8}- NEGATIVE SPACE IS THE AREA
THAT YOU DON'T TATTOO.

07:01.129 --> 07:03.047
IF YOU DON'T HAVE
ENOUGH NEGATIVE SPACE,

07:03.131 --> 07:05.591
THE ENTIRE THING BECOMES DARK
AND UNREADABLE.

07:05.675 --> 07:08.261
- TODAY YOU MUST USE
GUNPOWDER

07:08.344 --> 07:10.388
TO CREATE A DESIGN.

07:10.471 --> 07:11.347
- IF WE'RE GONNA USE GUNPOWDER
TO MAKE ART,

07:11.430 --> 07:13.891
{\an8}SOMEBODY'S GOING HOME
IN AN AMBULANCE.

07:13.975 --> 07:15.518
- YOU'LL HAVE TWO HOURS

07:15.601 --> 07:19.147
TO CAREFULLY SPREAD
THE GUNPOWDER ON AN 8x8 CANVAS.

07:19.230 --> 07:23.693
AND WHEN THE TIME RUNS OUT,
YOUR CANVAS WILL EXPLODE.

07:23.776 --> 07:25.194
- THAT'S AWESOME.
- ONCE THE FIRE DIES DOWN,

07:25.278 --> 07:28.531
YOUR WORK WILL BE REVEALED.

07:28.614 --> 07:31.784
JUST LIKE TATTOOING A CANVAS,
YOU MUST HAVE A LIGHT HAND.

07:31.868 --> 07:35.705
IF YOU USE TOO MUCH GUNPOWDER,
YOUR CANVAS WILL BURN THROUGH,

07:35.788 --> 07:37.248
DESTROYING YOUR DESIGN.

07:37.331 --> 07:39.584
{\an8}- THIS IS GONNA BE
ONE OF THOSE THINGS

07:39.667 --> 07:41.502
{\an8}WHERE YOU HAVE ONE SHOT
TO DO IT.

07:41.586 --> 07:46.132
- THERE IS A CATCH.
YOU MUST WORK AS A TEAM.

07:46.215 --> 07:49.635
HALO, YOU WON
THE LAST ELIMINATION TATTOO.

07:49.719 --> 07:52.513
YOU NOW HAVE THE POWER
TO ASSIGN THE TEAMS.

07:52.597 --> 07:55.600
OBVIOUSLY, WE DON'T HAVE
AN EVEN PLAYING FIELD RIGHT NOW.

07:55.683 --> 07:57.435
SOMEBODY IS GONNA
HAVE TO WORK ALONE,

07:57.518 --> 07:58.686
AND THAT'S UP TO YOU
TO DECIDE.

07:58.769 --> 08:01.230
{\an8}- I'M GONNA MAKE SURE THAT
MY TEAM IS THE STRONGEST TEAM

08:01.314 --> 08:03.941
{\an8}AND NO ONE ELSE
HAS A CHANCE.

08:04.025 --> 08:06.235
{\an8}- I DO NOT WANT TO WORK WITH JAY
AGAIN.

08:06.319 --> 08:11.032
{\an8}WHEN JAY GETS FRUSTRATED,
HE GETS REALLY MEAN.

08:11.115 --> 08:13.784
{\an8}- I'M WORRIED THAT HALO'S
JUST GONNA LEAVE ME ON MY OWN

08:13.868 --> 08:15.411
{\an8}AND TRY TO SCREW ME
ON THIS.

08:15.494 --> 08:16.621
- ONE BY ONE,

08:16.704 --> 08:19.040
PLEASE READ THE NUMBER
ON THE BOTTOM OF YOUR SKULL

08:19.123 --> 08:21.375
TO DETERMINE YOUR TEAM.

08:21.459 --> 08:23.753
- NUMBER ONE.

08:23.836 --> 08:26.756
- NUMBER FOUR.

08:26.839 --> 08:31.594
- THREE.

08:31.677 --> 08:34.054
- FOUR.

08:34.138 --> 08:37.558
- YOU'RE PUTTING GENTLE JAY AND
LYDIA TOGETHER WITH GUNPOWDER?

08:40.186 --> 08:41.604
{\an8}[bleep]'S GONNA BLOW UP.

08:41.687 --> 08:44.106
{\an8}- TWO.
- THREE.

08:44.190 --> 08:46.442
{\an8}- A VERY POWERFUL TOOL
WHEN YOU'RE IN A COMPETITION

08:46.525 --> 08:47.360
{\an8}IS TO LEARN
HOW TO USE YOUR ENEMIES.

08:47.443 --> 08:50.404
I NEED TO KNOW
HOW SCOTT'S MIND WORKS,

08:50.488 --> 08:52.573
SO I'M GONNA KNOW
HOW TO BEAT HIM.

08:56.535 --> 09:00.164
- NUMBER TWO.

09:00.248 --> 09:03.668
- SAUSAGE, YOU'RE GONNA BE
THE SOLO MAN ON THIS CHALLENGE.

09:03.751 --> 09:06.128
{\an8}- AM I REALLY
THAT TOUGH OF A COMPETITOR

09:06.212 --> 09:07.838
{\an8}THAT NOW
I'M BEING PICKED ON?

09:07.922 --> 09:09.757
- THE WINNERS
OF TODAY'S FLASH CHALLENGE

09:09.840 --> 09:12.176
WILL HAVE THE POWER TO ASSIGN
ALL HUMAN CANVASES

09:12.260 --> 09:14.637
IN THE ELIMINATION TATTOO
TOGETHER

09:14.720 --> 09:15.596
OR NOT.

09:15.680 --> 09:18.015
YOU HAVE TWO HOURS,

09:18.099 --> 09:20.601
AND YOUR TIME STARTS NOW.

09:24.188 --> 09:25.856
- WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT TATTOOING
NEGATIVE SPACE,

09:25.940 --> 09:28.734
{\an8}IT'S JUST THE AREA OF THE TATTOO
THAT YOU DON'T TATTOO.

09:28.818 --> 09:31.112
IT'S THE SKIN
THAT SHOWS THROUGH.

09:31.195 --> 09:33.531
NEGATIVE SPACE IS ALL ABOUT
WHAT CANVAS YOU LEAVE OPEN,

09:33.614 --> 09:35.491
NOT ABOUT WHAT
YOU'RE PUTTING DOWN.

09:35.574 --> 09:37.493
IT'S WHAT
YOU'RE LEAVING OUT.

09:37.576 --> 09:40.288
- DO YOU WANT THE CIRCLE
AROUND HER HEAD COMPLETELY SAND?

09:40.371 --> 09:42.707
- IT'S GONNA BE
REALLY LIGHT

09:42.790 --> 09:44.417
TOWARDS WHERE
THE BACK OF HER IS,

09:44.500 --> 09:45.876
SO IT CAN FADE OUT.

09:45.960 --> 09:48.296
{\an8}MELISSA KNOWS THAT
SHE'S PAIRED UP WITH SOMEBODY

09:48.379 --> 09:49.964
{\an8}WHO'S BEEN IN THE TOP
MORE OFTEN THAN HER.

09:50.047 --> 09:53.009
{\an8}SO SHE'S GIVEN ME FREE REIN
ON WHATEVER I'M GONNA DO.

09:53.092 --> 09:55.177
{\an8}- SO THE TOP OF THE CIRCLE
WILL BE CUT OFF?

09:55.261 --> 09:56.429
{\an8}- YOU HAVE TO THINK OF IT
IN REVERSE,

09:56.512 --> 09:59.098
{\an8}BECAUSE WHERE WE PUT THE SAND
IS WHERE THE LIGHT'S GONNA BE.

09:59.181 --> 10:01.183
{\an8}- THIS CHALLENGE
IS REALLY DIFFICULT,

10:01.267 --> 10:03.227
BECAUSE WHEREVER
WE'RE PUTTING THE SAND

10:03.311 --> 10:04.478
IS GOING TO BE
THE NEGATIVE SPACE,

10:04.562 --> 10:06.981
AND THEN THE GUNPOWDER IS GONNA
BURN THE REST OF IT DARK.

10:07.064 --> 10:10.067
IT'S ALMOST LIKE
THINKING BACKWARDS.

10:10.151 --> 10:12.028
- YOU SEE HOW THIS ONE
COMES UP LIKE THIS?

10:12.111 --> 10:15.406
IF IT CAME DOWN HERE,
LIKE, THERE WAS ONE BIG HILL

10:15.489 --> 10:16.657
IN YOUR WAY
BEFORE YOU GOT TO THE PYRAMID.

10:16.741 --> 10:18.242
- THAT'S A GOOD-ASS IDEA.
HELL, YEAH.

10:18.326 --> 10:19.118
- I'M TAKING THE LEAD.

10:19.201 --> 10:21.370
{\an8}THIS IDEA WAS BASICALLY
MY CONCEPT,

10:21.454 --> 10:24.623
AND I DON'T WANT HALO
TO RUIN IT.

10:24.707 --> 10:25.416
- COME OVER HERE AND DO
SOMETHING WITH THAT EDGE

10:25.499 --> 10:27.168
RIGHT THERE.
THAT'S KILLING ME.

10:27.251 --> 10:28.836
- WHICH ONE, THE FLAME?

10:28.919 --> 10:30.796
- THIS [bleep] THING
RIGHT HERE.

10:30.880 --> 10:32.715
THAT WAS [bleep] BUGGING
THE [bleep] OUT OF ME.

10:32.798 --> 10:35.176
- HE'S TRYING TO MICROMANAGE
MY ART. IT'S ANNOYING.

10:35.259 --> 10:36.844
{\an8}JUST TRUST ME AND LET ME DO MY
THING, AND IT'LL LOOK AWESOME.

10:36.927 --> 10:39.680
{\an8}- YOU WANT TO RUN THROUGH
THE MIDDLE OF SAUSAGE'S

10:39.764 --> 10:42.516
{\an8}AND WATCH HIM CRY?
- HE'S PROBABLY CRYING ALREADY.

10:42.600 --> 10:46.854
{\an8}- I HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO CLUE
WHY HALO WOULD PUT ME BY MYSELF.

10:46.937 --> 10:48.939
{\an8}- SAUSAGE, MAN,
IT'S NOTHING PERSONAL, DUDE.

10:49.023 --> 10:52.401
{\an8}YOU'RE JUST TOO STRONG.
YOU GOT TO PLAY BY YOURSELF.

10:52.485 --> 10:56.072
{\an8}- 45 MINUTES REMAINING,
EVERYBODY.

10:56.155 --> 10:57.782
{\an8}- I REALLY FEEL LIKE
I'M IN QUICKSAND,

10:57.865 --> 10:59.408
{\an8}AND SOMEBODY'S GOT A BOOT
TO MY FOREHEAD.

10:59.492 --> 11:00.576
AND IF THEY CAN KICK ME
WHILE I'M DOWN,

11:00.659 --> 11:04.080
THEN THAT'S THE BEST TIME
TO DO IT.

11:04.163 --> 11:08.167
- I'M READY FOR GUNPOWDER
WHEN YOU ARE, MAN.

11:10.169 --> 11:12.588
- SEVEN REMAINING CONTESTANTS
OF <i> INK MASTER</i> DIED TODAY

11:12.671 --> 11:16.926
IN A TRAGIC
GUNPOWDER ACCIDENT.

11:17.009 --> 11:17.760
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

11:17.843 --> 11:19.762
- WE'RE GONNA NEED
MORE GUNPOWDER.

11:19.845 --> 11:21.097
WE GOT TO DARKEN IT
A LITTLE BIT.

11:21.180 --> 11:22.473
- NO, WE'RE GOOD.

11:22.556 --> 11:23.974
YOU DON'T WANT TOO MUCH
OF A CONCENTRATION,

11:24.058 --> 11:27.645
'CAUSE IT'LL JUST GO
INTO A [bleep] FIREBALL.

11:27.728 --> 11:29.772
IF WE GO TOO FAR,
WE'RE DONE.

11:29.855 --> 11:30.606
- IF IT SETS ON FIRE, IT'S NOT
LIKE--IT'S NOT GONNA BE BLACK.

11:30.689 --> 11:32.358
- NO, WE'RE GONNA
SET IT ON FIRE.

11:32.441 --> 11:33.609
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

11:33.692 --> 11:35.778
YOU WANT TO BE
THE DECISION MAKER?

11:35.861 --> 11:38.239
{\an8}GO AHEAD AND MAKE THE DECISION.
WATCH WHAT HAPPENS.

11:38.322 --> 11:42.118
- FIVE, FOUR, THREE,

11:42.201 --> 11:43.911
TWO, ONE.

11:43.994 --> 11:46.997
THAT IS IT.
TIME IS UP.

11:47.081 --> 11:49.333
- I WANT TO [bleep] SEE IT
BLOW UP.

11:49.417 --> 11:51.168
- 'CAUSE I WANT TO SEE IT
BLOW UP.

11:51.252 --> 11:56.757
- THREE, TWO, ONE.

11:56.841 --> 12:00.469
- [laughs]

12:00.553 --> 12:02.304
- WHOO-HOO!

12:02.388 --> 12:04.181
- HOLY [bleep].
- AAH!

12:04.265 --> 12:05.933
- OH.

12:06.016 --> 12:07.935
- YEP.
KNEW THAT WAS COMING.

12:08.018 --> 12:11.188
{\an8}- WE HAVE
A VERY SPECIAL GUEST JUDGE.

12:11.272 --> 12:13.649
{\an8}- YEAH!
- ROB ZOMBIE!

12:13.732 --> 12:15.985
- LET ME MAKE IT CLEAR.
THIS IS GOING ON MY BODY.

12:16.068 --> 12:18.112
I DO NOT CARE
IF YOU GO HOME.

12:23.534 --> 12:27.663
- THREE, TWO, ONE.

12:27.746 --> 12:30.374
- HELL, YEAH.

12:32.877 --> 12:34.336
- WHOO-HOO!
- HOLY [bleep].

12:34.420 --> 12:36.422
- AAH!
- OH.

12:36.505 --> 12:40.092
- YEP.
KNEW THAT WAS COMING.

12:40.176 --> 12:41.510
EVERYBODY ELSE'S
IS A PUFF OF SMOKE,

12:41.594 --> 12:46.015
AND OURS TURNS
INTO A RAGING INFERNO.

12:46.098 --> 12:50.519
- [coughs]

12:50.603 --> 12:52.021
- I [bleep] TOLD YOU SO.

12:52.104 --> 12:53.272
- READY?
- [bleep], YEAH, DUDE.

12:53.355 --> 13:00.112
- [laughs]
DUDE.

13:00.196 --> 13:02.281
- HALO AND SCOTT.

13:02.364 --> 13:04.116
- THE USE OF NEGATIVE SPACE
YOU GUYS HAVE IN THE SKY

13:04.200 --> 13:05.534
IS THE PART
THAT I'M THE MOST DRAWN TO.

13:05.618 --> 13:07.620
IT HAS A LOT OF NATURAL FLOW
TO IT.

13:07.703 --> 13:09.914
- I REALLY LIKE THE LITTLE
DETAILS YOU GOT IN THE GROUND,

13:09.997 --> 13:12.625
'CAUSE IT GAVE IT
MULTITONES.

13:12.708 --> 13:14.418
- MATTI AND MELISSA.

13:14.502 --> 13:16.212
TO BE ABLE TO PULL OFF
THE SHADING

13:16.295 --> 13:19.173
THAT YOU DID HERE IN THE FACE
IS PRETTY SPECTACULAR WORK.

13:19.256 --> 13:20.716
- Y'ALL GOT
A LOT OF NICE DETAIL.

13:20.799 --> 13:23.427
REALLY, MY ONLY COMPLAINT IS
THAT THE BORDER AROUND THE TOP

13:23.511 --> 13:26.722
DIDN'T GET A LOT OF ATTENTION
PAID TO IT.

13:26.805 --> 13:29.934
- LYDIA AND JAY, SO WHO WAS
RESPONSIBLE FOR WHAT?

13:30.017 --> 13:32.561
- I DID THE SKULL.
SHE DID THE FLAMES.

13:32.645 --> 13:34.063
AND WE BOTH LAID OUT
THE MISTY STUFF.

13:34.146 --> 13:35.814
- JAY, YOU SAID
YOU DID THE SKULL?

13:35.898 --> 13:37.107
- MM-HMM.

13:37.191 --> 13:38.234
- THERE IS SOME NICE,
VERY CRISP LINES IN THERE.

13:38.317 --> 13:40.319
YOU DON'T REALLY SEE
THAT SAME CRISPNESS OR DETAIL

13:40.402 --> 13:42.738
IN THE FLAMES.

13:42.821 --> 13:43.906
- OF COURSE, THE JUDGES
DON'T LIKE LYDIA'S FLAMES,

13:43.989 --> 13:48.035
{\an8}SO I'M NOT GONNA WIN AGAIN.
I'M PISSED OFF.

13:48.118 --> 13:50.120
- SAUSAGE.

13:50.204 --> 13:52.206
- THE WAY THAT EVERYTHING
IS NICE AND DARK

13:52.289 --> 13:55.668
WITH SUCH A STARK-WHITE IMAGE,
THE NEGATIVE REALLY POPS OUT.

13:55.751 --> 13:58.087
THE ONLY PLACE THAT'S CONFUSING
IS THE SHAPE OF THE CLAW

13:58.170 --> 13:59.171
AND THE SHAPE OF THE FLAMES
UP TOP--

13:59.255 --> 14:00.464
YOU KIND OF LOSE
A LITTLE BIT.

14:00.548 --> 14:03.551
BUT OVERALL, IT'S JUST
A VERY GRAPHIC PRINT.

14:03.634 --> 14:07.346
- THANK YOU VERY MUCH,
GUYS.

14:07.429 --> 14:09.515
{\an8}- SAUSAGE LOOKS LIKE
HE WENT ON A SAFARI

14:09.598 --> 14:11.100
{\an8}AND SHOT A ZEBRA
AND HUNG IT UP ON THE WALL.

14:11.183 --> 14:12.851
IT IS NOT GOOD.

14:12.935 --> 14:14.270
- INTERESTING CHALLENGE TODAY,

14:14.353 --> 14:16.564
USE OF NEGATIVE SPACE
WITH GUNPOWDER.

14:16.647 --> 14:19.733
JAY AND LYDIA DID
A VERY QUESTIONABLE DESIGN.

14:19.817 --> 14:21.569
- HE WASN'T HAPPY
WITH WHAT SHE DID.

14:21.652 --> 14:22.736
SHE WASN'T HAPPY
WITH WHAT HE DID.

14:22.820 --> 14:24.321
TEAMWORK IS A BIG ISSUE.

14:24.405 --> 14:26.240
- SAUSAGE DID
THE DRAGON GRAPHIC.

14:26.323 --> 14:28.534
- BECAUSE THE CLAW FLOWED
IN THE SAME DIRECTION

14:28.617 --> 14:29.994
AS THE FLAMES WERE FLOWING,

14:30.077 --> 14:32.788
IT JUST MADE EVERYTHING
A LITTLE BIT ZEBRA-ESQUE.

14:32.871 --> 14:34.456
- TWO TEAMS WORKED REALLY WELL
TOGETHER.

14:34.540 --> 14:36.584
MELISSA AND MATTI
DID THE VIRGIN MARY.

14:36.667 --> 14:39.753
- THE SUBTLE IMAGERY AROUND IT
MAKES IT SO ICONIC.

14:39.837 --> 14:41.463
OVERALL, THE USE
OF NEGATIVE SPACE REALLY WORKED

14:41.547 --> 14:43.048
IN THEIR FAVOR.

14:43.132 --> 14:45.759
- ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF A
SUCCESSFUL TEAM, HALO AND SCOTT.

14:45.843 --> 14:47.177
- THEY PUT A DESIGN TOGETHER

14:47.261 --> 14:48.470
THAT LOOKS LIKE ONE PERSON
THOUGHT OF IT.

14:48.554 --> 14:50.472
AND IT'S ONE OF THE PIECES
WE SEE TODAY

14:50.556 --> 14:51.724
THAT HAS A FEW DIFFERENT TONES.

14:51.807 --> 14:52.766
- WE HAVE A DECISION?

14:52.850 --> 14:53.767
- WE DO.
- WE'RE GOOD.

14:53.851 --> 14:56.854
- COOL.
LET'S LET THEM KNOW.

14:56.937 --> 15:00.441
TODAY YOU CREATED EXPLOSIVE
DESIGNS USING GUNPOWDER.

15:00.524 --> 15:02.484
THE JUDGES HAVE DECIDED

15:02.568 --> 15:07.281
THAT THE WINNERS OF
TODAY'S FLASH CHALLENGE ARE...

15:11.243 --> 15:14.204
HALO AND SCOTT.

15:14.288 --> 15:15.748
CONGRATULATIONS, GUYS.

15:15.831 --> 15:17.625
YOU'LL HAVE THE POWER TO ASSIGN
ALL THE HUMAN CANVASES

15:17.708 --> 15:20.753
FOR THE ELIMINATION TATTOO
TOGETHER.

15:20.836 --> 15:22.546
- I'M STILL IN CONTROL,

15:22.630 --> 15:24.465
{\an8}AND I CAN STILL RUN THIS
COMPETITION THE WAY I WANT TO.

15:24.548 --> 15:28.177
AT THIS POINT, EVERY SINGLE
PERSON IS STANDING IN MY WAY.

15:28.260 --> 15:29.511
- ALL RIGHT, GUYS,
HEAD BACK TO THE LOFT

15:29.595 --> 15:31.972
AND PREPARE TO MEET
YOUR HUMAN CANVASES

15:32.056 --> 15:34.475
FOR THE ELIMINATION TATTOO.

15:44.193 --> 15:45.694
- THAT'S [bleep] UP
WITH KYLE, MAN.

15:45.778 --> 15:47.363
AS SOON AS THEY BROUGHT
THEM JUDGES IN, DUDE...

15:47.446 --> 15:48.781
- AS SOON AS HE SAW
HIS FACE...

15:48.864 --> 15:50.991
- I'LL JUST CALL YOU
A BITCH.

15:51.075 --> 15:52.660
- WHAT IS--
WHAT ARE WE TALKING ABOUT?

15:52.743 --> 15:53.452
- YOU'RE [bleep] CALLING ME
INSANE?

15:53.535 --> 15:54.787
YEAH, I'M [bleep] INSANE.

15:54.870 --> 15:56.080
YOU WANT TO PUSH ME
TO A LEVEL OF INSANITY?

15:56.163 --> 15:58.290
[bleep], YEAH,
YOU'LL GET THAT.

15:58.374 --> 16:00.709
- KYLE.

16:00.793 --> 16:02.711
- COME ON.
- SLOW DOWN, BRO.

16:02.795 --> 16:05.214
- HEY, GET THE [bleep] OFF ME,
BITCH-ASS.

16:05.297 --> 16:07.591
- KYLE.
- LET'S GO.

16:08.592 --> 16:12.471
- HE LET HIS EMOTIONS
GET THE BEST OF HIM.

16:12.554 --> 16:14.264
{\an8}THIS IS WHAT
THE WEAKER ARTISTS DO

16:14.348 --> 16:15.891
{\an8}WHEN THEY'RE AT THE END
OF THEIR ROPE.

16:15.974 --> 16:17.476
THEY CRACK
UNDER THE PRESSURE.

16:17.559 --> 16:19.603
- I DON'T THINK KYLE WAS RIGHT
FOR WHAT HE DID AT ALL.

16:19.687 --> 16:21.522
- I THINK IT WAS
A LOT OF STUFF BUILT UP.

16:21.605 --> 16:22.856
- WE'RE NOT HERE
TO BOX, MAN.

16:22.940 --> 16:24.775
- YEAH, BUT, DUDE, YOU BACK
FIVE DOGS INTO A CORNER,

16:24.858 --> 16:28.112
ONE OF THEM'S GONNA BITE YOU.
- MM-HMM.

16:36.578 --> 16:38.539
- WELCOME
TO THE ELIMINATION TATTOO.

16:38.622 --> 16:42.418
THIS IS YOUR CHANCE TO PROVE
THAT YOU DESERVE $100,000,

16:42.501 --> 16:44.378
A FEATURE
IN <i> INKED MAGAZINE,</i>

16:44.461 --> 16:46.004
AND THE TITLE
OF INK MASTER.

16:46.088 --> 16:49.174
YOU'LL BE JUDGED BY OLIVER PECK,
CHRIS NUNEZ, AND MYSELF.

16:49.258 --> 16:50.426
BUT WE'RE NOT
YOUR ONLY CRITICS.

16:50.509 --> 16:53.345
EACH WEEK, YOU'LL ALSO BE JUDGED
BY AMERICA.

16:53.429 --> 16:55.055
VIEWERS AT HOME
WILL SCOUR EVERY DETAIL

16:55.139 --> 16:58.016
OF YOUR ELIMINATION TATTOOS
AT INKMASTER.SPIKE.COM

16:58.100 --> 17:01.812
AND VOTE FOR THE TATTOO
THAT THEY THINK IS THE BEST.

17:01.895 --> 17:04.690
AMERICA'S VOTE
WILL HAVE A MASSIVE IMPACT

17:04.772 --> 17:05.983
AT THE LIVE FINALE.

17:06.066 --> 17:08.777
WE ALSO HAVE
A VERY SPECIAL GUEST JUDGE.

17:08.861 --> 17:10.279
HE'S A MUSICIAN

17:10.362 --> 17:13.574
AND DIRECTOR OF SOME OF
THE MOST GRUESOME HORROR MOVIES.

17:13.656 --> 17:16.410
- OH, WAIT A SECOND.
- ROB ZOMBIE.

17:16.492 --> 17:17.953
- YEAH!
- [laughs]

17:18.037 --> 17:20.329
- YEAH, DUDE.

17:20.414 --> 17:22.624
{\an8}- [laughs]
ROB ZOMBIE!

17:22.708 --> 17:24.877
{\an8}- I HAVE BEEN A MUSICIAN
FOR A LONG, LONG TIME.

17:24.960 --> 17:28.130
{\an8}THEN I TRANSITIONED
INTO MAKING FILMS.

17:28.213 --> 17:30.799
ANYTHING DARK, [bleep] UP,
AND WEIRD IS WHAT I LIKE TO DO.

17:30.883 --> 17:31.925
I'M JUST DRAWN
TO THE THINGS

17:32.009 --> 17:34.094
THAT YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED
TO LOOK AT,

17:34.178 --> 17:35.637
'CAUSE THEY'RE ALWAYS
THE MOST INTERESTING.

17:35.721 --> 17:37.306
- [bleep] COOL, MAN.
- BADASS.

17:37.389 --> 17:41.268
- IN THE ELIMINATION TATTOO,
IT'S MORE IMPORTANT THAN EVER

17:41.351 --> 17:42.644
TO WIN TATTOO OF THE DAY,

17:42.728 --> 17:44.897
BECAUSE THE WINNER MUST PUT
ONE ARTIST UP FOR ELIMINATION.

17:44.980 --> 17:48.734
THIS WEEK,
WE'RE TESTING NEGATIVE SPACE.

17:48.817 --> 17:50.903
{\an8}- NEGATIVE SPACE IS THE PARTS
THAT YOU DON'T TATTOO.

17:50.986 --> 17:52.362
IT'S EVERYTHING THAT YOU BUILD
AROUND THE SKIN

17:52.446 --> 17:53.489
THAT YOU LEAVE OPEN.

17:53.572 --> 17:56.533
- TODAY NEGATIVE SPACE IS
ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL,

17:56.617 --> 17:59.161
BECAUSE YOU MUST TATTOO

17:59.244 --> 18:00.996
BLACK AND GRAY.

18:01.079 --> 18:02.414
- [bleep] RIGHT.

18:02.498 --> 18:04.374
{\an8}- IF YOU DON'T HAVE
ENOUGH NEGATIVE SPACE

18:04.458 --> 18:05.501
{\an8}IN A BLACK-AND-GRAY TATTOO,

18:05.584 --> 18:06.877
{\an8}THE ENTIRE THING BECOMES DARK
AND UNREADABLE.

18:06.960 --> 18:09.546
{\an8}- YOU'RE ONLY USING
BLACK INK,

18:09.630 --> 18:11.673
{\an8}SO YOU HAVE TO LET THE SKIN
PEEK THROUGH

18:11.757 --> 18:13.592
{\an8}TO REPRESENT
ALL OF YOUR LIGHTER AREAS.

18:13.675 --> 18:15.928
{\an8}- TODAY YOU MUST TATTOO
A CREATURE

18:16.011 --> 18:17.971
{\an8}THAT APPEARS
IN ALMOST EVERY CULTURE,

18:18.055 --> 18:21.350
{\an8}WHEREVER HUMANS STRUGGLE
WITH GOOD AND EVIL--

18:21.433 --> 18:23.227
{\an8}A DEMON.
- YES.

18:23.310 --> 18:24.186
{\an8}BLACK-AND-GRAY HORROR TATTOOS

18:24.269 --> 18:26.939
{\an8}IS SOMETHING THAT I CAN DO
IN MY SLEEP.

18:27.022 --> 18:29.983
I DO THEM ALL THE TIME.
THIS IS [bleep] AWESOME.

18:30.067 --> 18:33.237
- LET'S MEET
YOUR CANVASES.

18:36.907 --> 18:39.701
HALO AND SCOTT, YOU GUYS
WON THE FLASH CHALLENGE.

18:39.785 --> 18:43.956
YOU NOW HAVE THE POWER TO ASSIGN
ALL HUMAN CANVASES TOGETHER.

18:44.039 --> 18:46.166
THIS IS A HUGE ADVANTAGE,
SO DO NOT WASTE IT.

18:46.250 --> 18:48.919
- HALO'S JUST AS THREATENED
BY SAUSAGE AS I AM,

18:49.002 --> 18:49.962
{\an8}AND WE'RE GONNA BE
GUNNING FOR HIM.

18:50.045 --> 18:51.046
{\an8}- WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING
TO GET DONE?

18:51.129 --> 18:54.550
{\an8}- A FEW DIFFERENT SUCCUBUSES
ON MY LEG.

18:54.633 --> 18:56.093
{\an8}- ALL RIGHT, SWEET.
- ALL RIGHT.

18:56.176 --> 18:58.554
{\an8}- I DON'T WANT TO TELL SCOTT
THAT I'M AIMING AT MATTI,

18:58.637 --> 18:59.471
{\an8}BUT I'M DEFINITELY TRYING
TO BREAK THE ALLIANCE UP.

18:59.555 --> 19:00.889
I FEEL LIKE
IT'LL MAKE SCOTT WEAKER.

19:00.973 --> 19:03.600
- LOOKING TO GET
A TERROR DOG DEMON.

19:03.684 --> 19:06.144
- OH.
- A SEXY, DEVILISH DEMON.

19:06.228 --> 19:09.398
- ABOUT HOW BIG?
- AS BIG AS YOU WANT TO GO.

19:09.481 --> 19:11.692
- IF YOU GET
A FEMININE DEMON,

19:11.775 --> 19:14.319
{\an8}IT MIGHT COME OFF TOO PRETTY
TO ACTUALLY LOOK LIKE A DEMON.

19:14.403 --> 19:18.907
SO THIS IS ONE TATTOO
THAT I REALLY DON'T WANT TO DO.

19:18.991 --> 19:23.579
- I'D LIKE TO GET SATAN
FLYING OUT OF MY LEFT THIGH.

19:23.662 --> 19:26.081
- I WOULD LIKE TO GET A GARGOYLE
ON THIS PORTION OF MY BODY.

19:26.164 --> 19:28.208
- CAN WE SEE THE CANVAS?

19:31.461 --> 19:32.588
JUST SIT NORMAL.
DON'T SUCK IT IN.

19:32.671 --> 19:35.215
- I'M NOT SUCKING IT IN.
- NO WAY.

19:35.299 --> 19:37.259
{\an8}- I'M REALLY NERVOUS,
BECAUSE I REALLY FEEL

19:37.342 --> 19:40.304
{\an8}THAT THERE'S A HUGE BULL'S-EYE
ON MY BACK.

19:40.387 --> 19:41.471
{\an8}- YEAH.

19:41.555 --> 19:42.848
{\an8}- SCOTT'S MY BOY,

19:42.931 --> 19:46.518
{\an8}SO I'M PRETTY SURE THAT
I'M GONNA BE SAFE IN THIS ONE.

19:46.602 --> 19:48.061
{\an8}- MM-MM.

19:48.145 --> 19:49.980
{\an8}- I'M GONNA HAVE TO MAKE A LOT
OF LAST-MINUTE MOVES

19:50.063 --> 19:52.691
{\an8}IF I'M TRYING
TO SCREW MATTI OVER WITH A SKULL

19:52.774 --> 19:54.610
{\an8}UNDER SCOTT'S WATCH.

19:54.693 --> 19:59.114
HERE YOU GO, BUD.
- ALL RIGHT.

19:59.197 --> 20:01.950
- CANVASES, ONE BY ONE,

20:02.034 --> 20:03.410
PLEASE READ THE ARTIST'S NAME
ON THE BOTTOM OF YOUR SKULL.

20:03.493 --> 20:07.205
- HALO.

20:07.289 --> 20:08.999
- MELISSA.

20:09.082 --> 20:10.834
- SCOTT.

20:10.918 --> 20:12.711
- LYDIA.

20:18.842 --> 20:21.428
- SAUSAGE.
- WHY ME?

20:21.511 --> 20:24.389
{\an8}HOW IN THE HELL
AM I GOING TO TAKE THIS CANVAS,

20:24.473 --> 20:25.182
PUT ON A WINNING PIECE?

20:25.265 --> 20:27.601
THIS SKIN
IS NOT TATTOO-ABLE.

20:27.684 --> 20:30.270
- MATTI.

20:30.354 --> 20:34.024
- GENTLE JAY.
- WHAT'S UP, BUDDY?

20:34.107 --> 20:36.652
- REMEMBER, GUYS,
AFTER THE ELIMINATION TATTOO,

20:36.735 --> 20:38.654
THE HUMAN CANVAS JURY
WILL VOTE ON THE TATTOO

20:38.737 --> 20:39.988
THAT THEY THINK
IS THE WORST

20:40.072 --> 20:41.031
AND PUT ONE OF YOU
UP FOR ELIMINATION.

20:41.114 --> 20:44.284
AND THE WINNER
OF TATTOO OF THE DAY

20:44.368 --> 20:46.703
WILL ALSO PUT AN ARTIST UP
FOR ELIMINATION.

20:46.787 --> 20:49.665
YOU WILL HAVE SIX HOURS
TO CREATE A TERRIFYING,

20:49.748 --> 20:51.708
BLACK-AND-GRAY DEMON.

20:51.792 --> 20:55.003
BASED ON YOUR WORK,
ONE OF YOU WILL BE CLOSING SHOP.

20:55.087 --> 20:57.172
GOOD LUCK.

20:57.255 --> 20:58.006
- NEGATIVE SPACE IS THE ESSENCE
OF BLACK AND GRAY.

20:58.090 --> 21:00.550
{\an8}ALL YOU HAVE
IS BLACK AND THE SKIN.

21:00.634 --> 21:04.179
{\an1}IF YOU TATTOO TOO MUCH, YOU'RE
TAKING AWAY YOUR NEGATIVE SPACE,

21:04.262 --> 21:06.723
AND YOU'RE GONNA CLOUD UP
YOUR DESIGN.

21:06.807 --> 21:09.851
- WHAT ARE YOU THINKING?
- BUSTY AND SEXY, VOLUPTUOUS.

21:09.935 --> 21:12.229
- OKAY. SO YOU'RE THINKING MORE,
LIKE, DEMON PINUP STYLE.

21:12.312 --> 21:13.855
- YEAH, LIKE,
EVIL AND SEXY.

21:13.939 --> 21:15.899
- ALL RIGHT,
SO YOU WANT SATAN HIMSELF.

21:15.983 --> 21:18.944
- YEAH. PITCHFORK IN HIS HAND.
- ALL RIGHT.

21:19.027 --> 21:21.029
- SO YOU WANT TO DO IT
ON YOUR STOMACH.

21:21.113 --> 21:22.280
- YEAH.

21:22.364 --> 21:23.198
- WHEN THE SKIN IS VERY LOOSE
AND DEFLATED,

21:23.281 --> 21:26.284
{\an8}IT MAKES IT EXTREMELY HARD
TO TATTOO.

21:26.368 --> 21:28.954
IT'S EXTREMELY HARD
TO WORK ON THE STOMACH.

21:29.037 --> 21:30.789
AND IT'S
A DISADVANTAGE TO ME,

21:30.872 --> 21:32.332
BECAUSE IT'S SKIN
THAT WAS NOW STRETCHED DOWN.

21:32.416 --> 21:34.543
I HAVE TO MAKE SURE
IT LOOKS DAMN GOOD

21:34.626 --> 21:36.378
SO THAT I CAN IMPRESS
THE JUDGES...

21:36.461 --> 21:38.380
- OKAY.
- AND WIN THIS THING.

21:38.463 --> 21:40.507
- LET ME MAKE IT CLEAR.
- MM-HMM.

21:40.590 --> 21:42.342
- I DO NOT CARE
IF YOU GO HOME.

21:42.426 --> 21:44.886
I DON'T CARE
IF YOU LOSE OR WIN.

21:44.970 --> 21:46.430
THIS IS GOING
ON MY BODY.

21:46.513 --> 21:48.307
- DON'T THINK THAT I'M
SITTING HERE ARGUING WITH YOU,

21:48.390 --> 21:49.808
'CAUSE THAT'S NOT
WHAT I'M DOING.

21:49.891 --> 21:51.685
- NO, I'M EXPLAINING.
YOUR STATUS IN THE COMPETITION

21:51.768 --> 21:54.438
IS NONE
OF MY [bleep] CONCERN.

21:54.521 --> 21:56.106
- WHAT THE HELL
AM I SUPPOSED TO DO?

21:56.189 --> 21:58.692
I'VE LEFT MY FAMILY
TO COME HERE TO WIN.

21:58.775 --> 22:00.318
AND THIS GUY'S
GONNA COME IN MY ROOM

22:00.402 --> 22:02.863
AND TELL ME
THAT HE DOESN'T GIVE A [bleep]

22:02.946 --> 22:04.072
AND ALL HE WANTS
IS HIS FREE TATTOO.

22:04.156 --> 22:06.116
I'M SCREWED.

22:11.496 --> 22:14.166
- STOMACH TATTOO, HUH?
I KNEW YOU COULD DO IT.

22:14.249 --> 22:16.543
- WELL, IF YOU KNEW
I COULD DO IT,

22:16.626 --> 22:18.462
WHY WOULDN'T YOU GIVE IT
TO SOMEBODY ELSE THAT COULDN'T?

22:18.545 --> 22:19.921
- THAT WOULDN'T BE NO FUN.

22:20.005 --> 22:21.381
YEAH, I WAS GIGGLING
A LITTLE BIT.

22:21.465 --> 22:23.091
I WAS LIKE, "OH, MAN, SAUSAGE IS
GONNA HAVE HIS WORK CUT OUT."

22:23.175 --> 22:24.676
- YEAH, YOU DIDN'T
GIVE A [bleep] ABOUT ME

22:24.760 --> 22:25.594
OR THE COMPETITION
OR ANYTHING ELSE.

22:25.677 --> 22:27.763
- REALLY?
SAUSAGE IS TOTALLY BUTTHURT,

22:27.846 --> 22:28.847
AND HE'S POUTING A LOT.

22:28.930 --> 22:31.266
WAAH. YOU WANT YOUR BINKY?
[imitates suckling]

22:31.349 --> 22:33.935
WE PICKED YOU A GOOD ONE.
- YEAH.

22:34.019 --> 22:35.353
BECAUSE ULTIMATELY,
I WAS ABLE TO REEL HIM BACK IN,

22:35.437 --> 22:40.400
AND HE'S GONNA GET
A REALLY COOL CHEST PIECE.

22:40.484 --> 22:43.028
- WHAT?
YOU TALKED HIM OUT OF IT?

22:43.111 --> 22:45.155
- UH-HUH.
SO IT'S--IT'S ALL GOOD.

22:45.238 --> 22:48.700
{\an8}- SAUSAGE,
YOU SLIPPERY LITTLE WIENER.

22:48.784 --> 22:52.037
EVERY TIME I GIVE HIM A HARD
CANVAS, HE SLIPS OUT OF IT.

22:52.120 --> 22:54.414
SAUSAGE TALKED HIM OUT
OF THE STOMACH.

22:54.498 --> 22:56.124
- GET THE [bleep] OUT OF HERE.
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

22:56.208 --> 22:58.960
- YEAH,
THAT LITTLE SAUSAGE.

22:59.044 --> 23:02.255
- THAT MOTHER[bleep].
- I KNOW, RIGHT?

23:03.757 --> 23:05.509
- ARTISTS, YOU HAVE SIX HOURS

23:05.592 --> 23:08.220
TO TATTOO
A BLACK-AND-GRAY DEMON,

23:08.303 --> 23:11.306
AND YOUR TIME BEGINS NOW.

23:11.389 --> 23:14.893
- STAND NICE AND STILL.
- ALL RIGHT.

23:14.976 --> 23:16.436
- LET'S DO IT.

23:16.520 --> 23:19.397
{\an8}- THE DIFFICULTY
IN CREATING NEGATIVE SPACE

23:19.481 --> 23:21.108
{\an8}IN A BLACK-AND-GRAY TATTOO

23:21.191 --> 23:23.693
{\an8}IS THE ARTIST UNDERSTANDING
WHERE THE LIGHT'S SUPPOSED TO BE

23:23.777 --> 23:26.113
{\an8}AND BEING ABLE TO DO
REALLY SMOOTH, GRADUAL FADES

23:26.196 --> 23:27.989
{\an8}LEADING UP TO THAT LIGHT

23:28.073 --> 23:30.617
{\an8}TO CREATE
THAT NICE, BEAUTIFUL HIGHLIGHT.

23:30.700 --> 23:33.829
- PERFECT.
- WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS, BRO?

23:33.912 --> 23:35.330
- THIS IS NOT GONNA WORK.
I'M REALLY DISAPPOINTED,

23:35.413 --> 23:37.415
'CAUSE I REALLY WANTED
THAT PILLAR.

23:37.499 --> 23:39.918
- JUST THE PILLAR
OR IS IT EVERYTHING ELSE TOO?

23:40.001 --> 23:41.670
MY CANVAS DOESN'T WANT
TO WORK WITH ME.

23:41.753 --> 23:43.296
{\an8}HE DOESN'T GIVE A [bleep].

23:43.380 --> 23:44.506
- THIS IS NOT WHAT WE DISCUSSED
AT ALL.

23:44.589 --> 23:47.509
- IT IS WHAT WE DISCUSSED.
- NO, IT'S NOT.

23:47.592 --> 23:49.344
THIS IS NOT WHAT WE DISCUSSED
AT ALL. THIS IS NOT THE PICTURE.

23:49.427 --> 23:51.346
- YEAH, IT IS.
- NO, IT'S NOT.

23:51.429 --> 23:53.014
- I WILL TATTOO MYSELF
TO STAY IN THIS COMPETITION,

23:53.098 --> 23:55.600
BUT THE LAST THING I'M GONNA
TATTOO ON MYSELF IS A DEMON.

23:55.684 --> 23:57.727
BEING A NEW MAN OF FAITH,

23:57.811 --> 23:59.187
THAT GOES
AGAINST MY RELIGIOUS BELIEFS.

23:59.271 --> 24:01.898
WHEN I LOOK UP PILLAR,
THERE'S THIS KIND OF PILLAR.

24:01.982 --> 24:03.400
IS THIS WHAT YOU WERE
KIND OF HOPING FOR THEN TOO?

24:03.483 --> 24:05.777
- I WAS KIND OF HOPING
THAT YOU WOULD DO IT.

24:05.861 --> 24:08.530
- I CAN'T LET HIM
WALK OUT THE DOOR.

24:08.613 --> 24:12.617
- STRAP ME DOWN,
AND LET THE PARTY BEGIN.

24:18.498 --> 24:22.252
- DUDE, THIS IS SO AWESOME.
- YOU LIKE IT?

24:22.335 --> 24:23.712
- I'M STOKED, DUDE.

24:23.795 --> 24:25.630
- I DEFINITELY NEED
TO OUTPERFORM SCOTT.

24:25.714 --> 24:28.175
{\an8}I NEED TO BE ABLE
TO WIN THIS,

24:28.258 --> 24:31.219
{\an8}SO I CAN CONTINUE
TO GET AN ADVANTAGE ON HIM.

24:34.139 --> 24:36.766
{\an8}- HALO'S TATTOO LOOKS LIKE
10 POUNDS OF [bleep]

24:36.850 --> 24:38.226
{\an8}IN A 5-POUND BAG.

24:38.310 --> 24:40.896
THERE'S WAY TOO MANY DIFFERENT
THINGS GOING ON IN IT.

24:40.979 --> 24:43.106
- [bleep], YEAH.

24:43.190 --> 24:44.733
- HALO BLEW HIS SKULL PICK
TODAY.

24:44.816 --> 24:46.359
- FOUR HOURS REMAINING.

24:46.443 --> 24:48.737
- THIS IS GONNA
KIND OF COME IN,

24:48.820 --> 24:51.448
AND THEN EVERYTHING'S JUST GONNA
KIND OF FADE OFF AS YOU SEE IT.

24:51.531 --> 24:53.241
IS THAT ALL RIGHT?
- THAT'S FINE.

24:53.325 --> 24:54.409
- WORK?
- YES.

24:54.492 --> 24:57.579
- COOL, THEN WE'LL GET YOU
STARTED, OKAY?

24:57.662 --> 24:59.539
YOU READY?
LITTLE POKE.

25:06.588 --> 25:09.424
- WHAT'S UP, BRAH?
- IT'S LOOKING GOOD, MATTI.

25:09.507 --> 25:10.550
- THANKS, MAN.

25:10.634 --> 25:12.677
ME AND SCOTT
HAVE A COMMON GOAL NOW,

25:12.761 --> 25:16.973
TO GET ME IN THE TOP THREE
AND SAUSAGE AND HALO OUT.

25:18.642 --> 25:20.560
I'M NOWHERE NEAR SAFE
IN THIS COMPETITION,

25:20.644 --> 25:24.439
AND I HAVE TO WORK REALLY HARD
TO SECURE MY PLACE.

25:24.522 --> 25:28.360
- THERE YOU GO.
THERE YOU GO.

25:29.945 --> 25:33.323
- I LIKE TATTOOING DEMONS.
I LIKE TATTOOING DEMONIC--

25:33.406 --> 25:36.201
- YEAH, YOU SEEM REALLY RELAXED
AND NOT NERVOUS AT ALL.

25:36.284 --> 25:37.118
- NO.

25:37.202 --> 25:38.995
I THINK SCOTT AND HALO
TRIED TO SCREW ME,

25:39.079 --> 25:40.413
AND IT WORKED
TO MY ADVANTAGE.

25:40.497 --> 25:41.998
{\an8}ALL THEY'RE DOING
IS MOTIVATING ME.

25:42.082 --> 25:43.875
- WHAT'S GOING ON, GUYS?
- WHAT'S UP, FELLAS?

25:43.959 --> 25:47.629
NOW THIS TATTOO'S GONNA COME OUT
BETTER THAN IT WOULD HAVE,

25:47.712 --> 25:49.965
BECAUSE NOW I WANT TO JAM IT
DOWN THEIR THROATS.

25:50.048 --> 25:51.925
I'M GONNA PUT
SOME NEGATIVE-SPACE FLAMES

25:52.008 --> 25:53.718
AND SOME SCREAMING SKULLS
IN THIS PART.

25:53.802 --> 25:55.136
- THAT'S COOL.
- THANK YOU.

25:55.220 --> 25:57.681
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO EMBARRASS ME
IN FRONT OF [bleep] ROB ZOMBIE.

25:57.764 --> 25:59.391
THAT [bleep]
AIN'T HAPPENING.

25:59.474 --> 26:02.644
- TWO MORE HOURS
REMAINING.

26:02.727 --> 26:05.230
- LOOKS COOL.

26:10.777 --> 26:14.322
{\an8}- I'M DEFINITELY WATCHING THIS
TATTOO GO FROM BAD TO WORSE.

26:14.406 --> 26:16.616
BECAUSE THIS IS
MY SPECIALTY,

26:16.700 --> 26:17.325
I SHOULD BE WINNING
THIS CHALLENGE,

26:17.409 --> 26:20.453
AND IT'S
NOT GONNA HAPPEN.

26:20.537 --> 26:24.332
{\an1}YOU HAD TO PICK SOMETHING WITH
ALL THE HAIR IN THE NETHERWORLD.

26:24.416 --> 26:26.042
I'M SPENDING SO MUCH TIME
ON THE HAIR,

26:26.126 --> 26:28.420
AND I'M DEFINITELY FREAKING OUT
ABOUT THE TIME I HAVE

26:28.503 --> 26:29.713
TO FINISH THE REST
OF THE BACKGROUND.

26:29.796 --> 26:31.131
BUT WITHOUT THE REST
OF THE BACKGROUND,

26:31.214 --> 26:32.215
THIS TATTOO IS NOT GOING TO SHOW
NEGATIVE SPACE

26:32.299 --> 26:35.385
LIKE I WOULD LIKE IT TO.

26:35.468 --> 26:37.429
- 30 MINUTES REMAIN,
EVERYBODY.

26:37.512 --> 26:39.431
- THE GUYS THAT WERE UP THERE
TODAY,

26:39.514 --> 26:40.849
THEY'RE GUNNING
FOR THE TOP PEOPLE.

26:40.932 --> 26:44.477
AS MUCH AS THEY SIT HERE AND TRY
TO THROW ME UNDER THE BUS,

26:44.561 --> 26:47.105
I'M GONNA BATTLE MY WAY
TO WIN.

26:47.188 --> 26:50.275
THERE'S A COUPLE BULLIES
THAT KIND OF FEEL

26:50.358 --> 26:53.028
THAT IF THEY GIVE ME ENOUGH
[bleep], MAYBE I'LL JUST TRIP,

26:53.111 --> 26:54.738
AND THEN I'LL FALL,
BUT THEY DON'T REALIZE

26:54.821 --> 26:58.199
THAT MY HISTORY HAS BEEN
TO TAKE WHATEVER IS GIVEN TO ME

26:58.283 --> 27:00.869
AND ABSOLUTELY CRUSH IT.

27:00.952 --> 27:04.039
KARMA'S A BITCH.

27:04.122 --> 27:08.126
- TEN, NINE, EIGHT, SEVEN,

27:08.209 --> 27:11.588
SIX, FIVE, FOUR,

27:11.671 --> 27:14.966
THREE, TWO, ONE.
THAT IS IT.

27:15.050 --> 27:18.386
MACHINES DOWN.
TIME IS UP. NO MORE INK.

27:18.470 --> 27:21.514
- YEAH, STAND UP. GET SOME BLOOD
BACK IN YOUR FEET.

27:21.598 --> 27:25.352
- [gasps]
THAT IS ONE SEXY, EVIL DEMON.

27:25.435 --> 27:27.187
{\an8}- THAT IS SICK.

27:27.270 --> 27:28.897
{\an8}- THAT IS AMAZING WORK.

27:28.980 --> 27:32.734
{\an8}- MELISSA IS FAILING MISERABLY.
SHE TRIED TO DO A RIPPING SKIN.

27:32.817 --> 27:36.237
{\an8}OVERALL, IT JUST LOOKS
LIKE A HUGE COVER-UP.

27:36.321 --> 27:37.906
{\an8}- THANK YOU SO MUCH.
- YOU ARE VERY WELCOME.

27:37.989 --> 27:40.742
{\an8}- I HAVE BEEN NICE AS [bleep]
TO YOU.

27:40.825 --> 27:42.952
{\an8}- THE POINT WASN'T TO SCREW YOU.
- BULL[bleep].

27:43.036 --> 27:44.245
- I WAS PRETTY MUCH
BLOWN AWAY.

27:44.329 --> 27:45.622
- THIS LOOKS LIKE A KID
IN HIGH SCHOOL DREW IT.

27:45.705 --> 27:47.999
- WHAT?
- IT'S JUST NOT THERE.

27:53.588 --> 27:56.925
- SO Y'ALL TRIED TO GIVE SAUSAGE
THAT SOGGY STOMACH.

27:57.008 --> 28:00.261
- OH, MAN. DUDE, THAT WAS--
- I'M NOT SUCKING MY STOMACH IN.

28:00.345 --> 28:02.389
- YOU LOOK UPSET.

28:02.472 --> 28:04.432
- IF THIS WOULD'VE BEEN A CANVAS
FOR ANYBODY ELSE,

28:04.516 --> 28:05.975
THEY WOULD'VE [bleep]
GOT MURDERED.

28:06.059 --> 28:07.310
I THINK BEING THROWN
UNDER THE BUS LIKE THAT

28:07.394 --> 28:10.313
IS A SLAP IN THE FACE.

28:10.397 --> 28:11.481
- WE WERE GUNNING FOR YOU,
MAN,

28:11.564 --> 28:13.650
BECAUSE YOU'RE ONE OF
THE STRONGEST ONES IN THE HOUSE

28:13.733 --> 28:14.901
WITH YOUR SKILL, DUDE.

28:14.984 --> 28:17.445
SAUSAGE IS JUST A BAD SPORT,
AND HE'S BEING A PANSY ASS.

28:17.529 --> 28:19.614
IF YOU'RE GONNA
PLAY THE VICTIM

28:19.697 --> 28:22.951
EVERY TIME YOU GET
A HARD SKULL--OH--

28:23.034 --> 28:25.286
GO HOME, DUDE.

28:25.370 --> 28:29.082
- I EXPECT IT FROM SCOTT.
- THIS ISN'T REAL LIFE.

28:29.165 --> 28:30.667
THIS IS A [bleep] COMPETITION,
MAN.

28:30.750 --> 28:33.128
- THE POINT WASN'T
TO SCREW YOU.

28:33.211 --> 28:36.464
THE POINT WAS TO GIVE YOU
SOMETHING YOU COULDN'T WIN ON.

28:36.548 --> 28:38.091
- I HAVE BEEN NICE AS [bleep]
TO YOU.

28:38.174 --> 28:41.803
- I'M NOT GONNA HAND YOU A PIECE
THAT YOU'RE GONNA [bleep] WIN

28:41.886 --> 28:42.929
TATTOO OF THE DAY WITH.

28:43.012 --> 28:44.139
- SO THIS IS HOW THE GAME'S
GONNA BE PLAYED?

28:44.222 --> 28:47.892
- SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST.
THAT'S THE [bleep] GAME, BRO.

29:02.240 --> 29:05.952
- ARTISTS, TODAY YOU HAD TO SHOW
NEGATIVE SPACE

29:06.035 --> 29:07.745
WITH A BLACK-AND-GRAY DEMON.

29:07.829 --> 29:11.040
LYDIA, YOU'RE UP FIRST.

29:11.124 --> 29:13.334
- WE'RE LOOKING
FOR NEGATIVE SPACE.

29:13.418 --> 29:16.171
THIS WHOLE TATTOO
IS THE SAME TONE.

29:16.254 --> 29:20.508
- BECAUSE THE TEETH ARE THE SAME
COLOR AS THE FUR, AS EVERYTHING,

29:20.592 --> 29:22.260
THE MOUTH
GETS REALLY LOST.

29:22.343 --> 29:25.597
- THE NEGATIVE SPACE STRIPES
COMING DOWN FROM THE TOP TEETH

29:25.680 --> 29:28.349
THROUGH THE BOTTOM JAW, WHAT
EFFECT ARE WE GOING FOR THERE?

29:28.433 --> 29:30.768
- DROOL.
- OH, IT'S DROOL?

29:30.852 --> 29:31.686
- I WOULD'VE LIKED TO HAVE SEEN
THE TEETH AND THE DROOL

29:31.769 --> 29:32.979
HAVE A LITTLE MORE ZING,

29:33.062 --> 29:34.772
SO WE DON'T HAVE TO QUESTION
WHAT THE LINES ARE.

29:34.856 --> 29:36.483
WONDERING WHAT SOMETHING IS
IN YOUR TATTOO

29:36.566 --> 29:39.819
IS NEVER A GOOD QUALITY.

29:42.197 --> 29:45.200
- MATTI.

29:45.283 --> 29:47.118
- AS FAR AS HITTING
THE CHALLENGE OF NEGATIVE SPACE,

29:47.202 --> 29:51.206
THERE ARE SOME VERY AMAZING
EXAMPLES OF THAT IN THIS TATTOO.

29:51.289 --> 29:53.374
I LOVE
THE NEGATIVE SMOKE FLAME.

29:53.458 --> 29:54.751
THE PART I DON'T LIKE
ABOUT THIS TATTOO

29:54.834 --> 29:57.545
IS THE BIG CHUNK OF HAIR GOING
OFF BEHIND HER SHOULDER.

29:57.629 --> 30:00.215
IT'S SO UNIFORM,
IT LOOKS LIKE A RIBCAGE.

30:00.298 --> 30:01.257
- MATTI, I LIKE THE HAIR.

30:01.341 --> 30:04.552
I THINK IT'S A VERY COOL,
STYLIZED TAKE ON IT.

30:04.636 --> 30:05.470
THE TRINKETS THAT YOU DID
IN THIS--

30:05.553 --> 30:08.806
THE SKULL, THE JEWEL--
VERY NICE.

30:13.019 --> 30:16.147
- MELISSA.

30:16.231 --> 30:18.066
- THE AMOUNT OF DETAIL YOU GOT
IN THIS THING IS VERY NICE,

30:18.149 --> 30:20.735
BUT IT'S DEFINITELY QUESTIONABLE
WHAT THIS THING IS.

30:20.818 --> 30:23.655
- HE DIDN'T WANT EARS.
HE DIDN'T WANT HORNS.

30:23.738 --> 30:26.324
HE JUST WANTED THE MOUTH
TO BE THE MAIN FOCUS OF IT.

30:26.407 --> 30:28.535
- IT'S THE ANGRY TURTLE.
- WHAT?

30:28.618 --> 30:30.161
- IT DOESN'T BOTHER ME
THAT IT LOOKS LIKE A TURTLE.

30:30.245 --> 30:33.164
BUT THE BIG, BLACK CIRCLES AT
THE TOP, YOU DON'T REALLY NEED,

30:33.248 --> 30:34.249
BECAUSE THE EDGE
OF THE TOP OF HIS HEAD

30:34.332 --> 30:36.167
KIND OF GETS A LITTLE BIT LOST
IN THAT BLACK THERE.

30:36.251 --> 30:41.464
- THAT IS A DESIGN FLAW, JUST IN
THE WAY THOSE HOLES ARE CREATED.

30:44.008 --> 30:48.137
- GENTLE JAY.

30:48.221 --> 30:50.181
- THE BACKGROUND DETRACTS
FROM THE SHAPE OF THE WINGS,

30:50.265 --> 30:54.269
AND THE TWO FACES FLOATING ABOVE
DETRACT FROM SATAN'S FACE.

30:54.352 --> 30:55.770
SO MY EYES SORT OF FIGHT

30:55.853 --> 30:57.647
FOR WHICH FACE
I'M ACTUALLY GONNA LOOK AT.

30:57.730 --> 31:00.608
- THERE'S VERY LITTLE AREA
OF DENSE, SOLID BLACK.

31:00.692 --> 31:02.318
YOU NEEDED TO BRING
SOME OF THAT BLACK

31:02.402 --> 31:04.404
EITHER IN THE BACKGROUND
BEHIND THE WINGS OR IN THE WINGS

31:04.487 --> 31:06.281
TO MAKE THESE STAND OUT
FROM THE BACKGROUND.

31:06.364 --> 31:09.242
AND THEN ALL THAT SMOKY MIST
THAT'S UP AROUND THE TOP,

31:09.325 --> 31:10.910
IT'S A LOT SKETCHIER,
A LOT GRAINIER

31:10.994 --> 31:12.829
THAN WHAT WE'VE SEEN FROM YOU
IN THE PAST.

31:12.912 --> 31:14.205
- I WAS RUNNING OUT OF TIME
AT THE END.

31:14.289 --> 31:16.624
- IT SHOWS--THE PARTS
OF THE TATTOO THAT ARE RUSHED

31:16.708 --> 31:19.961
IS A BIG DIFFERENCE
IN QUALITY.

31:22.922 --> 31:26.301
- HALO.

31:26.384 --> 31:27.427
MY FIRST INSTINCT
WHEN I SAW THIS WAS,

31:27.510 --> 31:30.263
VERY HARD TO READ.

31:30.346 --> 31:31.973
THIS WING
THAT COMES DOWN,

31:32.056 --> 31:34.058
I THOUGHT THAT WAS SOME KIND OF
A ROAD GOING UP TO A MOUNTAIN.

31:34.142 --> 31:39.022
AND I STILL CAN'T FIGURE OUT
IF THIS IS A BREASTPLATE

31:39.105 --> 31:42.317
OR IF THERE'S A HAND HOLDING
SOMETHING IN FRONT OF HER.

31:42.400 --> 31:44.611
- IT'S KIND OF MADE TO LOOK LIKE
FINGERS THAT KIND OF CUP IT.

31:44.694 --> 31:46.571
- IT DEFINITELY IS THE ODDEST,
WEIRDEST ONE OF THE BUNCH,

31:46.654 --> 31:48.489
BECAUSE THERE IS A LOT
OF DETAILED ELEMENTS

31:48.573 --> 31:49.824
AND A VERY STRANGE
COMPOSITION.

31:49.907 --> 31:52.493
- HE HAD SO MANY ELEMENTS
OF COOL THINGS.

31:52.577 --> 31:53.995
AND I WAS LIKE, "OH,
I WANT TO PUT THESE WINGS IN.

31:54.078 --> 31:55.622
"AND I DEFINITELY WANT TO GET
THOSE SHOULDER PADS.

31:55.705 --> 31:57.206
"AND I WANT TO GET
THIS BREASTPLATE,

31:57.290 --> 31:58.249
'CAUSE IT'S COOL, AND"--

31:58.333 --> 31:59.083
- YOU JUST TOOK ON
A LOT OF DRAWING.

31:59.167 --> 32:00.710
IF YOU DON'T SWING
FOR THE FENCES,

32:00.793 --> 32:02.086
YOU DON'T HIT THEM, RIGHT?

32:02.170 --> 32:05.715
BUT THIS WAS DEFINITELY A BIG
SWING IN A SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME.

32:08.051 --> 32:10.094
- SCOTT.

32:12.096 --> 32:15.350
- THE CRAFTSMANSHIP ON THIS
IS REALLY NICE, MAN.

32:15.433 --> 32:18.061
THE REALLY SMOOTH BLACK
TO VERY LIGHT GRAYS,

32:18.144 --> 32:19.437
THIS IS A GREAT EXAMPLE
OF USING THE NEGATIVE SPACE

32:19.520 --> 32:21.689
TO CREATE HIGHLIGHT.

32:21.773 --> 32:23.483
- BUT WE'RE LOOKING
FOR THE DEMONS.

32:23.566 --> 32:24.859
YOU KIND OF MISSED THE MARK
ON THAT.

32:24.942 --> 32:26.944
SOMETHING SCREAMING OR SOMETHING
SHOWING A LITTLE MORE ANGER

32:27.028 --> 32:32.200
WOULD'VE PORTRAYED A DEMON
A LITTLE BETTER.

32:32.283 --> 32:35.870
- SAUSAGE.

32:35.953 --> 32:38.706
- WELL, I GOT TO ADMIT,
WHEN HE SAID, "GARGOYLE,"

32:38.790 --> 32:39.666
I KIND OF ROLLED MY EYES,
LIKE, "OH, BOY."

32:39.749 --> 32:40.875
IT JUST SOUNDS SO CORNY.

32:40.958 --> 32:44.003
THEN I SAW IT,
I WAS PRETTY MUCH BLOWN AWAY.

32:44.087 --> 32:45.213
THERE'S A LOT OF LAYERS
TO IT.

32:45.296 --> 32:48.549
AND IT LOOKS LIKE STONE,
BUT IT HAS MOVEMENT AND ACTION.

32:48.633 --> 32:49.967
AND THE PERSPECTIVE IS ODD
AND DIFFERENT.

32:50.051 --> 32:52.762
IT'S PRETTY AMAZING.
- THANK YOU.

32:52.845 --> 32:54.138
- THE DYNAMIC HAND THAT YOU HAVE
IN THE FOREGROUND

32:54.222 --> 32:55.223
IS A REALLY NICE TOUCH.

32:55.306 --> 32:56.557
ALL THAT
REALLY HEAVY SHADING,

32:56.641 --> 32:58.810
BUT WITH THE NICE SKIN BREAKS
MAKES IT VERY LEGIBLE.

32:58.893 --> 33:01.104
IT DOESN'T GET LOST
IN THE BACKGROUND.

33:01.187 --> 33:02.355
OVERALL, MAN,
IT'S A GOOD JOB.

33:02.438 --> 33:04.107
- SOUNDS LIKE
HALO AND SCOTT'S ATTEMPT

33:04.190 --> 33:06.067
AT THROWING YOU UNDER THE BUS
MAY HAVE BACKFIRED, HUH?

33:06.150 --> 33:07.110
- I'M HOPING SO.

33:07.193 --> 33:09.904
- WELL DONE, MAN.
- THANK YOU.

33:13.324 --> 33:15.702
- BEFORE WE SEND YOU BACK
TO THE LOFT,

33:15.785 --> 33:19.789
THE JUDGES HAVE DETERMINED
A WINNER.

33:19.872 --> 33:23.543
THE JUDGES HAVE DECIDED THAT
THE BEST TATTOO OF THE DAY...

33:27.505 --> 33:29.674
GOES TO SAUSAGE.

33:33.845 --> 33:35.680
- OVERCOMING THE ADVERSITIES
YOU HAD FROM THE START,

33:35.763 --> 33:37.473
JUST THE SIGNS
OF A TRUE PROFESSIONAL.

33:37.557 --> 33:39.934
GREAT TATTOO, SAUSAGE.
- WELL DONE, MAN.

33:40.017 --> 33:41.561
- THANK YOU.
- YOU NOW HAVE THE POWER

33:41.644 --> 33:43.813
TO CHOOSE THE ARTIST THAT
YOU THINK HAS THE WORST TATTOO

33:43.896 --> 33:46.607
AND PUT THEM UP
FOR ELIMINATION.

33:46.691 --> 33:48.651
THE HUMAN CANVAS JURY
IS ALSO DELIBERATING RIGHT NOW.

33:48.735 --> 33:52.113
THEIR VOTE WILL PUT ANOTHER
ARTIST UP FOR ELIMINATION.

33:52.196 --> 33:53.239
HEAD ON BACK TO THE LOFT.

33:53.322 --> 33:56.117
WE'LL CALL YOU
WHEN WE HAVE A DECISION.

34:02.039 --> 34:04.083
- YOU WIN, MAN, AND NOW
YOU GOTTA SEND SOMEONE HOME.

34:04.167 --> 34:06.627
- MM-HMM.
- DON'T UNDERESTIMATE

34:06.711 --> 34:08.838
HOW MUCH POWER
YOUR DECISION'S GONNA HAVE.

34:08.920 --> 34:13.801
I WOULD PUT JAY, MELISSA,
AND LYDIA AT THE BOTTOM.

34:13.885 --> 34:14.594
- I WOULD PUT MINE ABOVE YOURS,
DUDE.

34:14.677 --> 34:15.428
- HOLD ON.
LET ME FINISH, BRO.

34:15.511 --> 34:17.013
- MINE HAD SMOOTH BLACK
AND GRAY.

34:17.096 --> 34:18.973
IT HAD NEGATIVE SPACE,
AND IT WAS A DEMON.

34:19.056 --> 34:21.350
YOURS DIDN'T READ AS A DEMON.
- [bleep] CARE

34:21.434 --> 34:22.810
IF SCOTT NAMES ME
ON THE BOTTOM.

34:22.893 --> 34:25.980
I'M WAITING TO SEE WHO
THE JUDGES NAME ON THE BOTTOM.

34:26.063 --> 34:27.315
- LYDIA, HOW DO YOU FEEL
BEING NAMED ON THE BOTTOM?

34:27.398 --> 34:28.483
- IT FEELS LIKE [bleep].

34:28.565 --> 34:30.610
IF I STAY
AND I'M GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY,

34:30.693 --> 34:32.527
I'M READY TO STEP OUT
OF MY COMFORT ZONE

34:32.612 --> 34:34.071
AND JUST DO
[bleep] BADASS TATTOOS.

34:34.155 --> 34:36.032
- I THINK THAT BEING THIS FAR
IN THE GAME,

34:36.114 --> 34:38.576
YOU SHOULD'VE
ALREADY DONE THAT.

34:38.659 --> 34:41.078
- I THINK SAUSAGE SHOULD MIND
HIS OWN [bleep] BUSINESS.

34:41.161 --> 34:42.413
{\an8}HE'S SITTING THERE
JUDGING ME.

34:42.496 --> 34:43.915
- IF THIS IS WHAT YOU NEED
TO GET A KICK IN THE ASS

34:43.998 --> 34:46.208
IN ORDER TO GO FURTHER
IN THE GAME,

34:46.292 --> 34:49.170
I THINK THAT YOU'VE SHOWED UP
TOO LATE TO THE GAME.

34:49.253 --> 34:52.507
I THINK THAT THERE'S PEOPLE
THAT ARE HERE

34:52.590 --> 34:53.800
THAT ARE CONSISTENTLY TRYING
TO PROVE THEMSELVES.

34:53.882 --> 34:56.636
AND IT'S PUT UP
OR SHUT UP NOW.

35:05.686 --> 35:08.189
- TODAY'S CHALLENGE--
BLACK-AND-GRAY DEMONS,

35:08.272 --> 35:08.856
USE OF NEGATIVE SPACE.

35:08.940 --> 35:09.982
LET'S TALK ABOUT THE BOTTOM.

35:10.066 --> 35:12.360
WE HAD LYDIA--
WHO I WAS SURPRISED--

35:12.443 --> 35:14.612
I THOUGHT THIS WAS GONNA BE
HER COMFORT ZONE.

35:14.695 --> 35:16.239
- IT'S PRETTY FLAT
WITH ONE TONE.

35:16.322 --> 35:18.407
THERE'S NOT ENOUGH BLACK
IN THE OUTLINE OF THE HAIR

35:18.491 --> 35:20.326
TO GIVE THIS THING DEFINITION
OR DEPTH.

35:20.409 --> 35:22.036
- GENTLE JAY.
- THE LIGHT SOURCE

35:22.119 --> 35:23.246
COULD'VE BEEN
REALLY DRAMATIC,

35:23.329 --> 35:25.414
BUT IT LOOKS LIKE
SATAN DROPPED A FLASHLIGHT.

35:25.498 --> 35:27.250
- ALL THE DETAIL HE PUT
INTO THE PITCHFORK GET LOST,

35:27.333 --> 35:30.419
'CAUSE IT'S RIGHT IN FRONT OF
THE WING WITH A LOT OF DETAIL.

35:30.503 --> 35:32.046
- LESS WOULD'VE BEEN
A LOT MORE.

35:32.129 --> 35:33.297
- MELISSA.

35:33.381 --> 35:35.550
- IT'S JUST A TURTLE DEMON
TO ME, MAN.

35:35.633 --> 35:37.885
- THE BACKGROUND OUTRIGHT LOOKS
LIKE A COVER-UP.

35:37.969 --> 35:40.471
- IT'S A DRASTIC DESIGN FLAW.

35:40.555 --> 35:42.223
- WE GOT HALO--THIS IS MY LEAST
FAVORITE THING HE'S DONE.

35:42.306 --> 35:45.726
- BUT AM I WRONG IN THINKING
THESE HORNS DON'T LOOK--

35:45.810 --> 35:47.019
- NO, YOU'RE 100%.
- NO, THEY'RE OFF.

35:47.103 --> 35:49.564
- HE WENT OVERBOARD, PUTTING
TOO MUCH CRAP IN THIS TATTOO.

35:49.647 --> 35:51.399
- HE OVERTHOUGHT IT.
- IT'S AN UNUSUAL DAY,

35:51.482 --> 35:54.902
BECAUSE HALO, WHO IS GENERALLY
ONE OF OUR STRONGER ARTISTS,

35:54.986 --> 35:57.405
HAS A MUCH MORE
DIFFICULT-TO-READ TATTOO

35:57.488 --> 35:58.614
THAN LYDIA OR MELISSA.

35:58.698 --> 36:00.241
IT'S GONNA BE INTERESTING
TO SEE

36:00.324 --> 36:01.826
WHO THE HUMAN CANVAS JURY
VOTES FOR.

36:01.909 --> 36:04.453
- I CAN'T WAIT TO FIND OUT
WHO THEY PICKED.

36:04.537 --> 36:07.999
{\an8}- WE'RE HERE TO DETERMINE WHO
HAS THE WORST TATTOO OF THE DAY.

36:08.082 --> 36:10.835
- THAT'S MY TATTOO,
AND LYDIA WAS MY ARTIST.

36:10.918 --> 36:13.921
- THOSE LINES ON THE SIDE OF
HIS MOUTH--LIKE HE'S DROOLING.

36:14.005 --> 36:14.839
- THAT'S WHAT IT IS.
IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE DROOL.

36:14.922 --> 36:17.425
- WHAT IS A TOOTH,
AND WHAT IS DROOL?

36:17.508 --> 36:19.802
- I THINK SHE NAILED IT WHEN IT
CAME TO THE CURLING OF THE LIPS,

36:19.886 --> 36:23.222
JUST THE VICIOUSNESS,
SHE GOT ME EVERYTHING I WANTED.

36:24.599 --> 36:26.726
- THIS IS MINE,
AND MELISSA DID MY TATTOO.

36:26.809 --> 36:28.436
- THAT HEAD IS SO FLAT.

36:28.519 --> 36:30.062
- AND THERE'S NO EYE.
- IS THERE A NOSE?

36:30.146 --> 36:31.814
- WHAT THE [bleep]
AM I LOOKING AT?

36:31.898 --> 36:32.732
- THIS IS SUPPOSED TO BE
A DEMON.

36:32.815 --> 36:34.192
- IT LOOKS LIKE A TURTLE.
- COME ON.

36:34.275 --> 36:35.776
- WASN'T SURE
WHAT YOU WERE GOING FOR, BRO.

36:35.860 --> 36:38.154
- I LIKE IT.

36:38.237 --> 36:40.615
- THAT'S MY TATTOO,
AND MY ARTIST WAS MATTI.

36:40.698 --> 36:43.159
I WANTED A SEXY DEMON.

36:43.242 --> 36:45.369
- IF THERE WERE EYES,
IT WOULD BE STRONGER.

36:45.453 --> 36:47.288
- I DIDN'T WANT EYES.
- IT JUST LOOKS EMPTY.

36:47.371 --> 36:48.789
- AN EMPTY SOUL.

36:48.873 --> 36:50.416
- THAT HAND LOOKS LIKE
IT'S BROKEN, RIGHT?

36:50.499 --> 36:53.502
- IF YOU GRABBED A CUP,
YOUR FINGERS WOULD BE BENT.

36:53.586 --> 36:55.254
- THEY WOULDN'T BE BENT THIS WAY
AND BENT THAT WAY.

36:55.338 --> 36:58.090
- I THINK BETWEEN THIS
AND THE TURTLE IS A TOSS-UP.

36:58.174 --> 37:00.593
- I--I DISAGREE.
THIS ONE LOOKS REAL.

37:00.676 --> 37:02.303
THIS LOOKS LIKE
A--A DEMON WOMAN.

37:02.386 --> 37:05.306
- I THINK WE'VE REACHED
OUR DECISION HERE TODAY.

37:05.389 --> 37:07.767
- YEAH.

37:07.850 --> 37:09.143
[door closes]

37:13.689 --> 37:18.319
- SAUSAGE, WHO ARE YOU
PUTTING UP FOR ELIMINATION?

37:18.402 --> 37:21.656
- I'M GONNA TAKE DOWN LYDIA.
- ALL RIGHT.

37:21.739 --> 37:25.826
WE NEED TO SEE SAUSAGE,
LYDIA,

37:25.910 --> 37:28.537
MELISSA,

37:28.621 --> 37:30.456
AND HALO.

37:33.834 --> 37:36.045
SEE Y'ALL IN THE SHOP.

37:36.128 --> 37:39.423
- WOW.
- I DID NOT SEE YOU COMING.

37:49.976 --> 37:53.187
- TODAY WE ASKED YOU TO SHOW US
NEGATIVE SPACE

37:53.270 --> 37:56.357
WITH A DEMON TATTOO.

37:56.440 --> 37:58.359
LYDIA, YOU'RE HERE

37:58.442 --> 38:01.654
BECAUSE SAUSAGE
PUT YOU UP FOR ELIMINATION.

38:01.737 --> 38:03.155
SAUSAGE, WHY LYDIA?
- OUT OF ALL OF THE DESIGNS,

38:03.239 --> 38:06.409
HERS LACKED
THE MOST RICH BLACK.

38:06.492 --> 38:08.953
AND THEN HER BACKGROUND WAS
WONKY, SO THAT'S WHY SHE'S HERE.

38:09.036 --> 38:11.706
- I GOT SO FOCUSED
ON THE HAIR

38:11.789 --> 38:12.832
THAT I FORGOT
MORE IMPORTANT ELEMENTS.

38:12.915 --> 38:14.333
I SHOULD'VE KILLED IT.

38:14.417 --> 38:16.210
EVERY TATTOO I DO IS GONNA GET
BETTER AND BETTER.

38:16.293 --> 38:18.754
- LOOKING FOR USE
OF NEGATIVE SPACE,

38:18.838 --> 38:20.548
WHAT YOU DON'T PUT IN
IS AS IMPORTANT AS WHAT YOU DO,

38:20.631 --> 38:24.301
AND THERE'S JUST NOT ENOUGH HERE
TO MAKE THAT CONTRAST.

38:26.804 --> 38:29.432
- MELISSA, YOU'RE HERE
BECAUSE THE HUMAN CANVAS JURY

38:29.515 --> 38:34.895
DETERMINED THAT YOU HAD
THE WORST TATTOO OF THE DAY.

38:34.979 --> 38:36.397
- I'M SURPRISED.

38:36.480 --> 38:38.399
I FELT LIKE THE DEMON PART
OF THE TATTOO WAS EXECUTED WELL.

38:38.482 --> 38:41.318
- YOUR CLIENT--HIS IDEAS
WERE BAD, AND UNFORTUNATELY,

38:41.402 --> 38:43.696
YOU NEEDED TO STEER HIM
IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION.

38:43.779 --> 38:46.907
- IF SOMEONE
IS SET ON SOMETHING,

38:46.991 --> 38:48.242
I'M NOT GONNA TELL THEM
"DON'T GET THAT,"

38:48.326 --> 38:50.578
BECAUSE I PERSONALLY
DON'T THINK IT'S AS COOL.

38:50.661 --> 38:53.914
- NO MATTER HOW STEADFAST
THIS GUY WAS,

38:53.998 --> 38:55.708
I'M PRETTY SURE
HE DIDN'T WANT A TURTLE.

38:55.791 --> 38:57.293
- I MEAN, I DON'T FULLY AGREE
WITH THE TURTLE THING.

38:57.376 --> 39:00.087
AND I DON'T THINK HE DID EITHER,
WHEN HE SAW IT.

39:00.171 --> 39:02.590
- CANVASES WALKING INTO THIS
ROOM PUT THEIR HIDE ON THE LINE,

39:02.673 --> 39:07.803
AND YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE TO GUIDE
YOUR CLIENT DOWN THE RIGHT ROAD.

39:07.887 --> 39:08.429
- HALO.

39:08.512 --> 39:11.098
- THIS IS A WEAK TATTOO.

39:11.182 --> 39:13.934
IT'S DEFINITELY A NOTCH DOWN
FROM WHAT WE EXPECTED.

39:14.018 --> 39:15.102
- I LOVE THAT PIECE.
YOU CAN TELL THAT'S A WING.

39:15.186 --> 39:16.562
YOU CAN TELL
THAT'S ARMOR.

39:16.645 --> 39:20.649
- ALL THE EXTENSIVE DETAIL WORK
YOU DID IN THERE IS SO TINY,

39:20.733 --> 39:21.734
FROM A DISTANCE,
THAT'S LOST.

39:21.817 --> 39:24.153
WE GET DOWN TO THIS POINT
OF THIS COMPETITION,

39:24.236 --> 39:26.447
EVERYTHING MATTERS.

39:28.032 --> 39:31.535
- LYDIA, MELISSA, HALO,

39:31.619 --> 39:35.956
ANY ONE OF YOU COULD
JUSTIFIABLY BE ELIMINATED.

39:36.040 --> 39:39.543
THE JUDGES HAVE DECIDED...

39:41.754 --> 39:45.341
LYDIA,

39:45.424 --> 39:49.678
YOU DO NOT HAVE WHAT IT TAKES
TO BE INK MASTER.

39:49.762 --> 39:51.388
- YOUR TATTOO WAS
SO MONOTONE THROUGHOUT,

39:51.472 --> 39:55.643
IT JUST DIDN'T HAVE
ANY GREAT SEPARATION.

39:55.726 --> 39:57.478
IT'S JUST NOT THERE.

39:57.561 --> 39:59.605
- PLEASE PACK YOUR MACHINES
AND CLOSE SHOP.

40:05.236 --> 40:09.156
- I KNOW THAT I COULD DO ALL
OF THESE TATTOOS 100% BETTER.

40:09.240 --> 40:11.283
I AM JUST NOT THE TYPE
OF ARTIST, APPARENTLY,

40:11.367 --> 40:14.578
THAT CAN DO GOOD ARTWORK
UNDER PRESSURE.

40:14.662 --> 40:19.625
THAT PART OF THE COMPETITION
IS WHAT [bleep] ME ALL UP.

40:19.708 --> 40:23.045
narrator: ON THE NEXT EPISODE
OF <i> INK MASTER...</i>

40:23.129 --> 40:25.673
- YOU MUST CREATE A CUSTOM
GRILL FOR BRANDON RIOS.

40:25.756 --> 40:28.676
- YEAH.

40:28.759 --> 40:29.802
- YOU TOLD ME--YOU'RE
NOT GONNA CHANGE IT ON ME?

40:29.885 --> 40:31.053
- IT DOESN'T LOOK RIGHT.

40:31.137 --> 40:32.555
- IT DOESN'T LOOK RIGHT,
OR YOU CAN'T DO IT?

40:32.638 --> 40:35.641
- [sighs] WE GOT OURSELVES
A BITCH, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.

40:35.724 --> 40:37.768
I'M JUST GONNA WIND UP
TATTOOING MYSELF.

40:37.852 --> 40:38.811
- YOU KNOW WHAT I DID
WITH THE SKULL

40:38.894 --> 40:39.812
LAST TIME
YOU GAVE IT TO ME.

40:39.895 --> 40:41.564
I [bleep] KNOCKED IT
OUT OF THE PARK.

40:41.647 --> 40:44.191
- I WOULD LOVE TO PUT A POUNDING
ON LITTLE SAUSAGE.

40:44.275 --> 40:45.651
SQUASH THAT WIENER.

40:45.734 --> 40:47.486
- SOMEONE HASN'T BEEN COMPLETELY
HONEST ABOUT THEIR ARTWORK.

40:47.570 --> 40:51.699
I HAVE SUSPICIONS
THAT SOMEONE HAS BEEN TRACING.

40:51.782 --> 40:54.618
THAT'S NOT
YOUR ORIGINAL ARTWORK.
