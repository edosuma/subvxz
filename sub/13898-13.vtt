[Crocker]
This is it, Jake.

00:34.610 --> 00:36.490
This has always been
your problem.

00:36.530 --> 00:37.660
You've got --

00:37.700 --> 00:39.160
way too much empathy

00:39.200 --> 00:40.910
even for a villain.

00:40.950 --> 00:43.790
Well, I am probably gonna feel

00:43.830 --> 00:46.500
pretty broken up about this.

00:46.540 --> 00:49.130
After the fact,
and all hindsight, you know.

00:49.170 --> 00:52.340
It's always terrible if you lose
a member of the family.

00:52.380 --> 00:54.510
And we are actually
family, now.

00:54.550 --> 00:56.680
Well, we share some,
at least.

00:57.890 --> 00:59.970
Don't worry.
This will be over real soon.

01:21.660 --> 01:23.700
I'm definitely
not going back to prison.

01:23.750 --> 01:25.040
No, you're going back to prison.

01:25.080 --> 01:26.420
And I'm sending Becker with you.

01:26.460 --> 01:27.670
For what it's worth,

01:27.710 --> 01:30.340
I would never kill my daughter's
favorite uncle.

01:30.380 --> 01:31.630
Oh, sure.
I'll believe you.

01:31.670 --> 01:33.170

you're such an honest guy.

What have you done
with Tinny?

01:42.310 --> 01:44.230
Relax, boy.

01:44.270 --> 01:46.020
Your niece is doing just fine.

01:46.060 --> 01:47.350
For now.

01:47.390 --> 01:50.150
Jake. Don't worry.
I can handle this.

01:50.190 --> 01:51.520
Just do not do what he says.

01:52.280 --> 01:55.240
Bravo.
Such spirit.

01:55.280 --> 01:57.860
Spoken like a true Doyle.

02:01.450 --> 02:02.370
What do you want?

02:02.410 --> 02:03.700
You've cost me something.

02:03.740 --> 02:05.830
The transport
full of police evidence.

02:05.870 --> 02:07.710
And I want it back.

02:07.750 --> 02:09.790
Look, this is between
you and me, alright.

02:09.830 --> 02:11.880
You just let her go.
And you take me. Easy.

02:11.920 --> 02:14.000
No, I like my plan better.

02:14.050 --> 02:16.670
Thanks to you, I've had plenty
of time to think about it.

02:16.720 --> 02:19.760
Bring me the contents
of that transport.

02:19.800 --> 02:23.350
And by the way.
I want Kevin Crocker as well.

02:23.390 --> 02:24.520

What the hell do you want

02:24.560 --> 02:25.470
with Kevin Crocker?

02:25.520 --> 02:27.100
Oh, he's grown on me.

02:27.140 --> 02:30.440
Now do as I say, and your niece
will be released unharmed.

02:30.980 --> 02:32.360
Don't do it--

02:32.400 --> 02:34.730

to bust out of prison

a police transport van?

Well, that's irrelevant
right now.

07:36.290 --> 07:37.410

07:37.450 --> 07:38.370
What?

07:38.410 --> 07:39.330
Explain.

07:39.370 --> 07:40.710
He's using her as leverage.

07:40.750 --> 07:42.790
He wants me to get to
the transport vehicle

07:42.830 --> 07:44.210
before you guys do.

07:44.250 --> 07:45.630
And then
he'll exchange it for Tinny.

07:45.670 --> 07:48.000
What a mess.
The GPS was disabled.

07:48.050 --> 07:50.470
We have no idea how,
in God's name, to track it.

07:50.510 --> 07:53.720
Every cop is spread all over
this city reigning in cons.

07:53.760 --> 07:55.760
I can do this.
You gotta let me help.

07:57.140 --> 07:59.140
I'm gonna have to.

07:59.180 --> 08:00.180
I got no choice.

08:00.230 --> 08:01.430
Great. I'll keep you posted.

08:01.480 --> 08:02.850
In the meantime,
do you have any evidence,

08:02.890 --> 08:04.860
any leads, anything that might
help me track it down?

08:04.900 --> 08:06.150
Wait.

08:07.610 --> 08:08.650
We found this.

08:08.690 --> 08:10.650
It was taken
from one of our cons.

08:10.690 --> 08:12.530
Said it was sold by our old
friend Taylor Gossard, downtown.

08:14.160 --> 08:17.370
The serial number matches one
of the guns in the transport.

08:18.330 --> 08:19.910
Jake. If these

08:19.950 --> 08:21.500
guns get out on our street,

08:21.540 --> 08:23.790
there's gonna be a lot more
people who are gonna get hurt.

08:23.830 --> 08:25.290
This is a good lead.

08:25.330 --> 08:27.550
I'll stake out this address
and see what I can find.

08:28.050 --> 08:29.130

08:29.710 --> 08:31.170
Watch your back.

08:31.220 --> 08:32.420

08:32.470 --> 08:34.590

and he's got nothing to lose.

08:34.630 --> 08:36.760
Don't worry.
I can handle him.

08:36.800 --> 08:38.640
And listen.

08:38.680 --> 08:40.850
I know this isn't exactly
the right time.

08:43.310 --> 08:45.400
I think I should come with you.

08:45.440 --> 08:46.360
What do you mean?

08:46.400 --> 08:47.310
If you take that job--

08:47.360 --> 08:49.110
I think I should--

08:50.610 --> 08:52.360
I want--

08:52.400 --> 08:53.950
to come with you.

08:56.450 --> 08:57.450
I'd like that too.

08:58.080 --> 08:59.790
We'll talk later.

09:05.290 --> 09:06.460
[Rose] I called
my contact with the city.

09:06.500 --> 09:07.920
She's gonna have her parking

09:07.960 --> 09:09.670
enforcement people keep an eye
out for that ambulance.

09:09.710 --> 09:10.880
You really think
that's gonna work?

09:10.920 --> 09:11.920
That they're gonna
park it downtown?

09:11.960 --> 09:13.170
[Rose]
Well, it's a long-shot.

09:13.210 --> 09:14.260
But you never know.
It's something.

09:14.300 --> 09:15.720
[Des] No, no, no.
That's a good idea.

09:15.760 --> 09:17.930
They're the real creatures of
the night, if you ask me.

09:17.970 --> 09:18.850
What does that mean?

09:18.890 --> 09:19.970
I have no idea.

09:20.010 --> 09:21.600
It's been a rough year
for little Des.

09:21.640 --> 09:23.220
[Malachy] I should have taken
a page out of Jake's book

09:23.270 --> 09:25.390
and took Becker out,
when I had a chance.

09:25.440 --> 09:26.980
[Rose]
Mal, there was no way of knowing

09:27.020 --> 09:28.650
that Becker was planning
a prison break,

09:28.690 --> 09:30.020
let alone he was gonna
grab Tinny.

09:30.070 --> 09:31.400
But we knew he was
up to something.

09:31.900 --> 09:33.360
Oh my God.

09:34.610 --> 09:35.950
Tinny--

09:35.990 --> 09:37.530
I don't know what I'd do
if anything happens to her.

09:39.200 --> 09:40.120
Whoa.

09:40.160 --> 09:41.240
The GPS from the ambulance.

09:41.280 --> 09:42.490
It wasn't working for a while.

09:42.540 --> 09:44.250
The signal was disabled.
But now--

09:44.290 --> 09:46.000
it's seems to be broadcasting
loud and clear.

09:46.040 --> 09:47.170
How is that even possible?

09:47.210 --> 09:48.790
Tinny--
She's reactivated it.

09:48.830 --> 09:49.750
Let's go.

09:49.790 --> 09:50.710
[Des]
Shockola--

09:50.750 --> 09:51.750
Tinny pulls through again.

09:51.800 --> 09:53.920
That's the woman
I knows and loves.

09:58.220 --> 09:59.510
Loves to---

10:01.220 --> 10:03.180
Oh Kathleen.
Can you please stay here?

10:03.220 --> 10:04.930
We need someone here in case
something comes up.

10:04.980 --> 10:08.350
Okay. Alright.
Bye bye.

10:17.110 --> 10:19.030
I can't believe
you got that bullet out.

10:20.910 --> 10:22.280
Thank you.

10:23.790 --> 10:28.250
Look. Could we just stop Becker
before it's too late.

10:28.290 --> 10:29.790
This is some serious stuff
he's into.

10:29.830 --> 10:32.090
And you're going down with him.

10:32.130 --> 10:33.750
You just do what you're told--

10:34.380 --> 10:36.510
when you're told.

10:52.770 --> 10:53.980
[Des]
The GPS is still going.

10:54.020 --> 10:55.740
This is where
the ambulance stopped.

11:02.200 --> 11:03.830
Okay.
So what's the plan here?

11:03.870 --> 11:05.080
Full on assault?
Or the old Shock and Awe?

11:05.120 --> 11:06.120
Rose.

11:06.160 --> 11:06.950
You take the passenger side.
Mal--

11:07.000 --> 11:08.540
You take the driver's side.

11:08.580 --> 11:10.000
I'll stand at the back so I'm
the first face that Tinny sees

11:10.040 --> 11:11.080
when she runs out.

11:11.120 --> 11:12.420
[Mal]
No. You both wait here.

11:12.460 --> 11:13.840
Mal,
be careful.

11:18.170 --> 11:19.670
[Jake]
Taylor Gossard's gonna be

11:19.720 --> 11:22.220
making his rounds trying to
unload his stolen merchandise.

11:23.640 --> 11:26.100
You know, your sister and I
used to come up here.

11:26.140 --> 11:27.890
We'd go into that park over
there and make out.

11:30.350 --> 11:31.270
You trying to get me to smash
your face in?

11:32.560 --> 11:34.320
I'm just saying
I really liked your sister.

11:35.020 --> 11:36.270
In fact, at one point,

11:36.320 --> 11:39.200
I even thought we had
a real future together.

11:40.450 --> 11:40.570
I'm warning you.

11:41.570 --> 11:44.200
And one day,
she just ended it.

11:44.240 --> 11:46.120
You know, now I realize,
that she just--

11:46.160 --> 11:50.210
obviously she didn't see in me
any kind of father material.

11:50.960 --> 11:52.750
I wonder why. Oh, right.

11:52.790 --> 11:55.290
Because you're a homicidal
maniac. I get it.

11:55.340 --> 11:56.210
Is that our guy?

11:59.420 --> 12:01.050
[Jake]
Yeah.

12:01.800 --> 12:02.970
Give me your arm.

12:03.590 --> 12:04.970
Not this again.

12:06.010 --> 12:08.220
[horn honks]

12:12.520 --> 12:13.440
Why do I think

12:13.480 --> 12:15.150
that you did that on purpose?

12:34.750 --> 12:35.830
Mal.

12:35.880 --> 12:37.710
You need to get back here.

12:39.250 --> 12:40.630
B'ys, there's blood in here.

12:40.670 --> 12:41.800
Where did he take her?

12:53.560 --> 12:54.600
[Malachy]
The GPS.

13:13.660 --> 13:16.080
You know, your driving is much
better than I remember.

13:16.120 --> 13:17.540
What are you talking about?

13:17.580 --> 13:18.250
When we were partners,
you never used to let me drive.

13:19.040 --> 13:20.170
I did so let you drive.

13:20.210 --> 13:21.750
Yeah, like, once.

13:21.800 --> 13:24.090
And you went straight down
the old Barter's Hill

13:24.130 --> 13:25.380
and smashed into Lar's
Convenience.

13:25.430 --> 13:27.050
See, I knew you'd bring that up.

13:27.090 --> 13:28.300
That was my first day
on the job.

13:28.350 --> 13:29.600
The roads were all icy, and--

13:29.640 --> 13:30.850
as I recall, you wouldn't stop

13:30.890 --> 13:31.850
yammering in my ear.

13:31.890 --> 13:32.770
Kinda like now.

13:36.440 --> 13:37.310
[crash]

13:48.740 --> 13:51.080
How's Sarah doing?

13:51.120 --> 13:52.410
She's somewhere safe.

13:52.450 --> 13:54.000
She still needs a doctor.

13:54.040 --> 13:55.620
She'll be fine.

13:55.660 --> 13:57.460
And thanks for your help.

13:57.500 --> 13:59.670
You know, the best way you could
show your gratitude

13:59.710 --> 14:01.090
is by letting me go.

14:01.130 --> 14:02.380
When your uncle

14:02.420 --> 14:04.630
takes car of what I need,
you can go home.

14:04.670 --> 14:06.800
In the meantime,
enjoy yourself.

14:06.840 --> 14:08.050
They're gonna find me.

14:08.550 --> 14:09.550
So--

14:09.590 --> 14:11.220
Why don't you just
turn yourself in,

14:11.260 --> 14:12.180
and we'll call it a day.

14:13.890 --> 14:15.270
You're his niece, all right.

14:15.310 --> 14:16.940
Aren't you?

14:16.980 --> 14:18.940
[phone rings]

14:21.110 --> 14:22.900
Everything's going as planned.

14:22.940 --> 14:24.730
You just make sure
the money is there.

14:24.780 --> 14:27.150
I'll live up
to my end of the bargain.

14:27.200 --> 14:28.610
There's no need of threats.

14:28.660 --> 14:31.780
You're gonna get your
merchandise today.

14:33.910 --> 14:35.200
They don't sound
like the kind of people

14:35.250 --> 14:36.500
you want to disappoint.

14:36.540 --> 14:38.960
It's too bad
you don't have the stash.

14:39.000 --> 14:41.170
You just hope
your uncle can find it.

14:42.290 --> 14:43.420
Alright, we got him.
Let's go.

14:44.960 --> 14:46.420
[explosion]

15:00.520 --> 15:01.900
[Crocker]
That was a good one Jake!

15:01.940 --> 15:03.060
What is wrong with you?

15:03.110 --> 15:04.610
That was our only way to get
Tinny back.

15:04.650 --> 15:06.070
Well, not that it really
matters--

15:06.110 --> 15:07.900
I think you probably blew up
that Taylor guy too.

15:07.940 --> 15:09.490
Who's the murderer now, pal?

15:09.530 --> 15:10.990
I didn't drive him
into that car.

15:11.030 --> 15:12.530
I'll testify on your behalf.

15:12.570 --> 15:14.240
Maybe we'll even share
the same jail cell.

15:14.280 --> 15:16.910
Just--
Go check it out.

15:16.950 --> 15:19.580
Me? You're the one who drove
the guy into the car.

15:19.620 --> 15:21.830
It's a miracle you didn't blow
us up too.

15:21.880 --> 15:23.340
That's a good point,
actually.

15:24.590 --> 15:26.590
The explosion
should have been way bigger.

15:26.630 --> 15:28.590
All that ammunition inside.

15:28.630 --> 15:30.470
He probably unloaded
the cargo earlier.

15:32.220 --> 15:34.760
Well, it looks like that Taylor
guy got away after all.

15:34.800 --> 15:36.390
Which is too bad,
'cause I was kinda looking

15:36.430 --> 15:36.970
forward to having you in
the big house with me.

15:38.520 --> 15:40.770
There'll be lots of time to get
me arrested. Don't worry.

15:46.070 --> 15:47.690
[Rose]
That could be anybody's blood.

15:47.730 --> 15:49.190
Becker's not dumb enough
to hurt Tinny.

15:49.240 --> 15:50.150
He needs her.

15:50.200 --> 15:51.240
[Malachy]
I know.

15:51.280 --> 15:52.360
I also know Tinny's
a mini-Jake.

15:52.410 --> 15:54.280
Sometimes she acts
without thinking.

15:54.320 --> 15:55.620
I got something.

15:55.660 --> 15:57.540
Okay. So the ambulance was
covered in blood, right?

15:57.580 --> 15:59.040
I also found--

15:59.080 --> 16:00.660
this.

16:00.710 --> 16:02.160
A bullet.

16:02.210 --> 16:03.210
You said Sarah Blackwell was
shot earlier, right?

16:03.250 --> 16:04.540
In your confrontation
with Becker.

16:04.580 --> 16:05.920
Okay.
That can't be Tinny's blood.

16:05.960 --> 16:08.300
'Cause she helped Sarah.

16:08.340 --> 16:10.260
Now, where would you go,
if you're a criminal bastard,

16:10.300 --> 16:11.840
and your girlfriend
just got shot.

16:14.590 --> 16:16.060
[ring]

16:16.680 --> 16:17.390
Did you find her?

16:17.430 --> 16:18.720
[Rose] No, not yet.

16:18.770 --> 16:19.810
But I need you to look up
Sarah Blackwell's file.

16:19.850 --> 16:21.390
She's been injured.

16:21.430 --> 16:23.400
Just see if there's anything
in there that might help us.

16:23.440 --> 16:24.770
Okay.

16:26.610 --> 16:27.520
Not much here.

16:27.570 --> 16:28.530
She's single.

16:28.570 --> 16:30.150
She graduated from MUN
years ago.

16:30.190 --> 16:31.700
Okay. Where did she work?

16:32.400 --> 16:33.860
A veterinary clinic.

16:33.910 --> 16:35.110
That would be the first place

16:35.160 --> 16:36.240
I would go, if I had to patch up
on the down low.

16:36.990 --> 16:38.080
Sarah must be there.

16:38.120 --> 16:39.330
And maybe Tinny.

16:39.370 --> 16:40.540
I'll meet you there.

16:40.580 --> 16:42.620
[Malachy]
Vet Clinic. Fast.

16:43.790 --> 16:44.670
[Crocker]
Don't you miss this?

16:44.710 --> 16:45.790
Just a little bit?

16:45.830 --> 16:48.300
You and me,
sifting through the clues.

16:48.340 --> 16:49.500
Cooking up theories.

16:49.550 --> 16:51.340
We had some good times, huh?

16:51.380 --> 16:52.760
Right up until you killed that
woman in cold blood.

16:52.800 --> 16:53.800
Come on.

16:53.840 --> 16:55.510
You're a better detective
than that.

16:55.550 --> 16:56.800
If you bothered to dig in
just a little bit,

16:56.850 --> 16:59.050
you'd know I didn't kill anyone.

16:59.100 --> 17:00.720
If you were innocent, why didn't
you stick around, you know.

17:00.770 --> 17:01.930
And try to prove it?

17:01.970 --> 17:03.980
Because the case was stacked
against me.

17:04.020 --> 17:06.560
And then there was
the robbery charge,

17:06.600 --> 17:07.810
and the kidnapping charge.

17:07.860 --> 17:08.770
I thought--
what the hell does it matter?

17:08.820 --> 17:09.730
But now--

17:09.770 --> 17:11.360
Now you're a daddy.

17:11.400 --> 17:12.570
You don't want your daughter
to think that

17:12.610 --> 17:13.990
you're a cold blooded murderer.

17:14.030 --> 17:15.240
Bingo.

17:15.280 --> 17:16.320
I don't buy it.

17:23.700 --> 17:26.370
[Jake] Parking receipt
with today's date on it.

17:26.420 --> 17:27.830
Which means they stopped this,
paid for the

17:27.880 --> 17:29.090
parking so they wouldn't
get a ticket.

17:30.460 --> 17:33.090
And transferred everything
into another vehicle.

17:42.140 --> 17:43.060
Who the hell are you?

17:43.100 --> 17:44.480
-Ow! Hey!
-Where is my daughter?

17:44.520 --> 17:45.440
My arm!

17:45.480 --> 17:46.390
Everything all right?

17:46.440 --> 17:47.230
Where's Tinny?

17:47.270 --> 17:48.310
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

17:48.350 --> 17:49.270
Let me help with that.
Where's Tinny?

17:49.310 --> 17:50.230
Ow!

17:50.270 --> 17:51.150
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

17:52.480 --> 17:53.820
[Tinny] So you've got
a big deal going down.

17:53.860 --> 17:55.240
But you don't have the goods.

17:55.280 --> 17:57.360
But luckily,
Uncle Jake is on the case.

17:57.410 --> 17:57.780
And if he doesn't find them,

17:59.280 --> 18:01.240
I think it's safe to say those
men are gonna kill you.

18:01.280 --> 18:03.040
I've been dealing with these
kinds of people

18:03.080 --> 18:05.330
since you were a thought
in someone's mind.

18:06.000 --> 18:07.120
On the other hand,

18:07.160 --> 18:08.790
maybe it's time
to stir the pot a little.

18:13.590 --> 18:14.670
So what makes you think

18:14.710 --> 18:15.630
Taylor hasn't left town,
after that little

18:15.670 --> 18:16.970
driving stunt of yours?

18:17.010 --> 18:18.260
Well first of all,
Taylor's greedy.

18:18.300 --> 18:19.640
Second of all,

18:19.680 --> 18:21.810
he'll need a vehicle
to transfer the stuff into.

18:21.850 --> 18:24.220
[ring]

18:24.270 --> 18:25.180
Becker.

18:25.230 --> 18:26.140
Jake.

18:26.180 --> 18:27.100
Just a little update.

18:27.140 --> 18:28.900
Your niece is still fine.

18:30.060 --> 18:32.820
But the clock is ticking.
As clocks do.

18:32.860 --> 18:34.110
Look, I got Crocker,
alright?

18:34.150 --> 18:35.320
I'll have the stuff soon.

18:35.360 --> 18:37.320
You're running out of time,
Jake.

18:37.360 --> 18:39.740
Therefore
Katrina's running out of time.

18:39.780 --> 18:41.120
Do you understand me?

18:51.250 --> 18:53.040
You're fooling yourself,
you know.

18:53.090 --> 18:54.050
You're on a major losing streak,

18:54.090 --> 18:55.510
when it comes to Jake.

18:55.550 --> 18:56.460
What's your point?

18:56.510 --> 18:58.720
[Tinny]
Stash or no stash,

18:58.760 --> 19:00.550
Jake will find you.

19:00.590 --> 19:03.260
Well, I'm counting on that,
Sweet face.

19:08.770 --> 19:10.150
Get some rest.

19:14.730 --> 19:16.280
[Jake]
Hey there.

19:16.320 --> 19:18.070
Listen.

19:18.110 --> 19:19.070
I'm just wondering.

19:19.110 --> 19:20.400
You wouldn't happen to know

19:20.450 --> 19:23.330
where I could get me some drugs,
contraband,

19:23.370 --> 19:24.370
guns, maybe--

19:24.410 --> 19:25.620
Taylor Gossard sent me.

19:30.580 --> 19:33.130
I think this has been some kind
of misunderstanding.

19:33.170 --> 19:34.090
[Crocker whistles]

19:34.130 --> 19:35.380
[bang]

19:35.420 --> 19:36.710
Not bad.

19:39.470 --> 19:40.970
I pretty much thought
that you were gonna bolt.

19:41.010 --> 19:42.510
Well, somebody's
gotta save my daughter.

19:47.270 --> 19:49.310
Well, well, well.

19:49.350 --> 19:51.770
We seem to have found the last
piece of the puzzle.

19:51.810 --> 19:53.650
Let's just pack this up
and go get Tinny back.

19:56.150 --> 19:57.320
Time to come clean.

19:57.360 --> 19:58.820
That's my daughter Becker has.

19:58.860 --> 19:59.950
So where is she?

20:01.280 --> 20:03.950
You really think he's coming
back for you, huh?

20:04.490 --> 20:05.950
He loves me.

20:05.990 --> 20:07.240
Which is why he left you here?

20:07.740 --> 20:08.410
Burn.

20:09.160 --> 20:10.620
He told me about you.

20:10.660 --> 20:12.580
He told me about all the things
your family did to him.

20:12.620 --> 20:15.290
Because he's an evil
criminal mastermind!

20:15.340 --> 20:16.590
And weird.

20:16.630 --> 20:17.590
You have my daughter.

20:17.630 --> 20:18.760
Okay?
She didn't deserve this.

20:18.800 --> 20:19.710
[Mal]
Where is she?

20:19.760 --> 20:20.800
Is she hurt?

20:20.840 --> 20:22.880
No. He's not gonna hurt her.

20:22.930 --> 20:24.470
She's a nice girl.

20:24.510 --> 20:25.640
She patched me up.

20:25.680 --> 20:27.180
Well then,
maybe it's time to repay her.

20:30.730 --> 20:31.390
He's at one of his old
rum hideouts.

20:32.230 --> 20:33.940
I'll give you the address.

20:37.820 --> 20:39.150
[Crocker]
You do realize that there's

20:39.190 --> 20:41.360
a distinct possibility
he's gonna kill me.

20:41.400 --> 20:43.780
And despite
your thoughts to the contrary,

20:43.820 --> 20:45.410
I am not working
with Maurice Becker.

20:45.450 --> 20:47.240
Really. Oh wait.
I don't care.

20:47.280 --> 20:48.910
I just want to get
my niece back.

20:48.950 --> 20:50.040
You mean,

20:50.080 --> 20:51.410
my daughter.

20:54.250 --> 20:55.500
Tinny's done just fine,

20:55.540 --> 20:56.290
up to this point,
without having you

20:56.330 --> 20:57.710
as a father.

20:57.750 --> 20:58.960
You ever think you might not
want to mess with that?

20:59.000 --> 21:00.340
God, you're right.
You're right.

21:00.380 --> 21:01.960
But I would rather
leave that decision

21:02.010 --> 21:03.510
'til we get her
back safe.

21:03.550 --> 21:04.680
Do you mind?

21:05.090 --> 21:05.970
Fine.

21:49.640 --> 21:52.390
So that cop--
Leslie Bennett?

21:53.310 --> 21:54.020
You bang her yet?

21:54.060 --> 21:55.430
The reason

21:55.480 --> 21:57.520
I ask-- is 'cause that
is one hell of a catch, Jake.

21:57.560 --> 21:59.610
You don't wanna
screw that up.

21:59.650 --> 22:00.110
Take that from me.

22:00.980 --> 22:01.730
Yeah, well,
I don't think

22:01.770 --> 22:03.150
I want relationship advice

22:03.190 --> 22:05.650
from a fella who didn't even
know he had a daughter.

22:05.690 --> 22:08.280
Your sister, Kathleen, kept all
of that a secret from me.

22:08.320 --> 22:09.660
I think we've established that.

22:09.700 --> 22:11.240
The best think Kathleen
ever did--

22:11.280 --> 22:13.080
was keep you away from Tinny.

22:13.120 --> 22:14.580
I couldn't agree with you more.

22:16.670 --> 22:17.250
Look--

22:17.290 --> 22:18.330
Becker's crazy.

22:18.370 --> 22:18.420
If we're gonna
get the jump on him--

22:19.960 --> 22:21.500
We're gonna have to catch him
when his guard is down.

22:21.540 --> 22:22.960
Before he makes his next move.

23:03.540 --> 23:05.300
Always the dramatic entrance.

23:05.920 --> 23:07.170
Where's my niece?

23:07.220 --> 23:09.180
Where's my merchandise?

23:09.220 --> 23:10.550
Look,
we got what you wanted.

23:10.590 --> 23:11.180
And obviously

23:11.220 --> 23:12.800
you got Crocker.

23:12.850 --> 23:15.640
I'm a little curious as to what
my part is in this whole plan.

23:15.680 --> 23:16.640
[Jake]
We did everything you said,

23:16.680 --> 23:18.180
down to every detail.

23:18.230 --> 23:19.520
Okay, where's Tinny?

23:19.560 --> 23:20.650
In due time.

23:24.520 --> 23:25.730
Wait a minute.

23:25.770 --> 23:27.690
You knew we were gonna find you,
didn't you?

23:27.740 --> 23:29.200
[Becker]
Let me guess.

23:29.860 --> 23:31.410
Sarah told you.

23:32.280 --> 23:33.740
She's the love of my life.

23:33.780 --> 23:35.740
She'll do anything
I tell her to.

23:35.790 --> 23:37.120
And now she's in jail.

23:37.160 --> 23:39.710
Well, you think so, now?

23:39.750 --> 23:40.920
She's a smart cookie.

23:40.960 --> 23:42.920
Why don't we just
beat it out of him?

23:42.960 --> 23:43.880
No, no, no, no.

23:43.920 --> 23:44.670
He's no good to us dead.

23:45.460 --> 23:47.300
No. Go ahead.
Kill me.

23:47.340 --> 23:48.670
Beat the hell out of me.

23:48.710 --> 23:51.130
But you'll never see
Katrina again.

23:52.010 --> 23:53.180
What do you want us to do?

23:54.050 --> 23:56.010
I want us to go for a ride.

24:07.320 --> 24:09.230
This is nice.

24:09.280 --> 24:13.030
Three generations of outlaws
on the open road.

24:13.070 --> 24:16.280
Father, son,
and him.

24:16.330 --> 24:17.830
One big happy family.

24:17.870 --> 24:19.540
It's gonna stay that way,
isn't it?

24:19.580 --> 24:20.370
If you want to see
your daughter again.

24:21.870 --> 24:23.920
You know, I know you keep
threatening to play this card.

24:23.960 --> 24:25.670
But I gotta tell you,
it's not working for me.

24:25.710 --> 24:27.630
You see, Tinny and I,
we're not all that close.

24:27.670 --> 24:29.210
[Becker]
Oh, no sir.

24:29.250 --> 24:30.590
She's in your blood
as much as you're in hers.

24:31.680 --> 24:33.090
He does not care
about his daughter.

24:33.130 --> 24:34.050
Trust me.

24:34.090 --> 24:35.010
[phone rings]

24:35.050 --> 24:35.930
I wouldn't answer that.

24:36.850 --> 24:38.270
[ringing]

24:41.350 --> 24:42.440
[Jake]
Alright. Enough of this.

24:42.480 --> 24:43.640
What's your big plan?

24:43.690 --> 24:45.270
[Becker] We gotta meet up
with these buyers.

24:45.310 --> 24:46.150
They're nasty gents.

24:47.110 --> 24:49.650
But it should go
smoothly enough.

24:49.690 --> 24:51.780
Now that we've got their drugs.
And I've got my muscle.

24:52.200 --> 24:53.280
Muscle?

24:53.320 --> 24:55.700
I'm your muscle?
This is your plan for me?

24:55.740 --> 24:56.990
[Becker]
For both of you.

24:57.030 --> 24:58.740
I needed some serious back up

24:58.780 --> 25:00.660
that I didn't have to cut in.

25:00.700 --> 25:03.080
And you two will do anything
you have to do

25:03.120 --> 25:05.000
to save your precious Tinny.

25:06.080 --> 25:07.500
These guys.
Do they play hardball?

25:07.540 --> 25:08.500
Nah.

25:08.540 --> 25:10.210
Nothing you two can't handle.

25:18.680 --> 25:19.810
You gotta be kidding me.

25:41.240 --> 25:43.120
Well, hello again,

25:43.160 --> 25:45.000
pretty bird.

25:45.040 --> 25:46.210
Where's Becker?

25:47.420 --> 25:49.630
Maurice Becker?

25:53.460 --> 25:54.630
Okay.
So I just heard from Jake.

25:54.670 --> 25:55.760
No sign of Tinny
at Becker's hideout.

25:55.800 --> 25:56.800
Oh Lord.

25:56.840 --> 25:57.970
I know. I know. Mal.
I'm worried too.

25:58.010 --> 26:00.350
But-- I know that
in my heart of hearts.

26:00.390 --> 26:03.970
In the little bitty heart
inside my heart--

26:04.020 --> 26:05.810
She's gonna
get out of this.

26:05.850 --> 26:07.190
Hope you're right.

26:09.400 --> 26:10.940
Busy times.

26:10.980 --> 26:13.940
Seventy five percent of the
fugitives have been recaptured.

26:13.990 --> 26:14.860
So we're getting there.

26:14.900 --> 26:15.780
Okay, so now just to

26:15.820 --> 26:16.950
get the remaining
twenty five.

26:16.990 --> 26:19.280
Man, I just saw someone
go by with a cat.

26:19.320 --> 26:21.120
I mean,
who robs a cat?

26:21.160 --> 26:22.660
Did Sarah tell you anything?

26:22.700 --> 26:24.660
Nothing yet.
She's not talking.

26:26.410 --> 26:27.290
What about Jake?

26:27.330 --> 26:28.420
Have you heard from him?

26:28.460 --> 26:29.830
He hasn't found Tinny,
but I'm guessing,

26:29.880 --> 26:31.500
the minute he finds anything,
he'll be calling you.

26:31.540 --> 26:33.420
I wouldn't have let
Jake follow up on this,

26:33.460 --> 26:36.130
but the station's resources
are down to nothing.

26:36.170 --> 26:37.510
The entire town is traumatized.

26:37.550 --> 26:38.470
I know.

26:38.510 --> 26:39.510
We're here to help.

26:39.550 --> 26:40.550
Becker is unpredictable.

26:40.590 --> 26:42.180
Which makes him very dangerous.

26:42.220 --> 26:43.140
This is for Tinny.

26:43.180 --> 26:44.890
We won't stop until she's safe.

26:45.430 --> 26:46.350
I know that.

26:46.390 --> 26:47.640
Oh, and--

26:48.730 --> 26:50.190
I heard.

26:50.230 --> 26:51.270
Congrats.

26:51.310 --> 26:54.030
Big job opportunity for you.

26:54.070 --> 26:54.940
Yeah.

26:54.980 --> 26:55.940
And--

26:55.990 --> 26:58.860
If you want to take Jake
with you--

26:58.900 --> 27:00.910
We'd kill to get him
off our hands.

27:04.490 --> 27:07.330
So, this is a bit odd,
but Becker's gal,

27:07.370 --> 27:09.580
Sarah-- She wants to talk.

27:11.500 --> 27:11.880
[Sarah] Immunity.

27:13.040 --> 27:14.800
That's the price tag
for getting Becker

27:14.840 --> 27:16.300
and your young
cop friend back.

27:17.090 --> 27:18.510
I wanna walk out of here.

27:18.550 --> 27:19.550
[Des]
Oh. That's fair.

27:20.130 --> 27:21.050
No, it's not.

27:21.090 --> 27:22.300
No, it's not.

27:22.350 --> 27:23.760
You helped Maurice Becker

27:23.800 --> 27:25.010
break out of prison.

27:25.060 --> 27:27.140
You wanna find little Tinny?

27:27.180 --> 27:29.350
I'd change
the negative attitude.

27:29.390 --> 27:31.310
And I'd hurry.

27:34.060 --> 27:35.940
I'd say with the current level

27:35.980 --> 27:37.190
of martial law
out there--

27:37.240 --> 27:38.490
We have no choice.

27:38.530 --> 27:41.530
We need a Judge,
or a Crown, fast.

27:41.570 --> 27:43.160
I'm on it.

27:46.580 --> 27:48.960
[ring]

27:49.000 --> 27:50.460
It's him.

27:50.500 --> 27:51.420
Did you find Tinny?

27:51.460 --> 27:52.420
[Mal] No. But Sarah claims

27:52.460 --> 27:53.380
she knows where she is.

27:53.420 --> 27:54.340
Where?

27:54.380 --> 27:55.250
She hasn't said.

27:55.290 --> 27:56.250
She'll give up the location.

27:56.300 --> 27:58.010
But she wants immunity
in return.

28:00.090 --> 28:01.720
We'll take care of it.

28:05.260 --> 28:07.060
[Crocker]
Well, what a friendly bunch.

28:08.060 --> 28:09.520
So, what's the play here,
partner?

28:09.560 --> 28:11.350
We see it out.

28:11.390 --> 28:13.190
Obviously the odds
are stacked against us.

28:13.230 --> 28:14.560
And this whole thing could go
south any minute.

28:14.610 --> 28:15.900
Especially with

28:15.940 --> 28:18.440
Paddy McHatster there
behind the wheel.

28:19.900 --> 28:21.200
That's a promising sign.

28:21.240 --> 28:22.360
Yeah.

28:22.400 --> 28:23.780
Or, they've just decided
to kill us.

28:25.320 --> 28:26.240
Either way,
it will be over soon.

28:26.910 --> 28:28.290
This is wonderful.

28:29.540 --> 28:30.450
So?

28:30.500 --> 28:31.290
It's all good.

28:31.330 --> 28:32.830
You really trust these guys?

28:32.870 --> 28:34.790
I mean, what's to stop them from
just shooting us in the back

28:34.830 --> 28:35.880
and taking the drugs and money
whenever they want.

28:36.960 --> 28:38.460
He's got an extremely
good point.

28:38.500 --> 28:41.170
You let me worry about that.

28:41.220 --> 28:42.880
So.
Unload the gear.

28:47.180 --> 28:48.520
[Tinny] What do you want with Becker?

28:49.350 --> 28:51.230
Ain't you the curious one?

28:53.060 --> 28:54.560
If you gotta know.

28:54.600 --> 28:57.570
I got some business,
he just might want a taste of.

28:58.730 --> 29:00.280
You mean the drugs
you stole from him?

29:00.320 --> 29:02.280
Look at you.

29:02.320 --> 29:03.740
Big detective
like your uncle Jakey.

29:04.660 --> 29:05.780
You might think you're smart.

29:05.820 --> 29:06.570
You don't know nothing.

29:07.120 --> 29:07.950
You got me?

29:07.990 --> 29:08.990
You really think

29:09.030 --> 29:10.580
selling those drugs
back to Becker

29:10.620 --> 29:12.830
is gonna end well for you?

29:12.870 --> 29:15.580
It ain't like I'm charging
the full price.

29:15.620 --> 29:17.170
More like a finder's fee.

29:18.040 --> 29:19.630
And besides--

29:19.670 --> 29:22.800
He just might appreciate
my initiative.

29:22.840 --> 29:24.090
Now stay quiet.

29:28.470 --> 29:30.640
Just let me tell you
how this is gonna go down.

29:30.680 --> 29:32.060
Becker's gonna get his stuff
back from you.

29:32.100 --> 29:33.020
And then he's gonna put a

29:33.060 --> 29:33.980
bullet in your head.

29:34.020 --> 29:35.600
You just shut up, alright?

29:35.640 --> 29:37.350
I mean,
that's if your lucky.

29:37.400 --> 29:38.860
If he doesn't shoot you
right away,

29:38.900 --> 29:40.110
he's gonna want to hurt you bad.

29:40.150 --> 29:41.070
Tell you what?

29:41.110 --> 29:42.740
I can hurt people too.

29:42.780 --> 29:44.440
Okay?

29:44.490 --> 29:48.700
None of this psychology babbling
is gonna work on me.

29:49.530 --> 29:51.370
Alright?

29:51.410 --> 29:54.620
This is Maurice Becker,
we're talking about.

29:54.660 --> 29:57.790
He busted out of prison.
Took down a transport.

29:57.830 --> 30:00.460
Kidnapped a police officer.

30:00.500 --> 30:02.710
You're in over your head.

30:05.010 --> 30:06.380
[Kathleen]
Walter.

30:06.430 --> 30:08.010
Thanks for coming.

30:08.050 --> 30:09.390
You should have told me earlier.

30:09.430 --> 30:11.470
I would have--

30:11.510 --> 30:13.270
I don't know.
I would have done something.

30:13.310 --> 30:15.180
Yeah.
Well, you're here now.

30:15.230 --> 30:16.350
What do you need?

30:16.390 --> 30:17.690
We need a favor.

30:17.730 --> 30:19.150
A big one.

30:19.190 --> 30:20.860
You really think Becker is just
gonna hand over Tinny

30:20.900 --> 30:21.610
after this deal is done?

30:22.610 --> 30:24.240
Assuming
we get out of here alive.

30:24.280 --> 30:25.650
He will.

30:25.690 --> 30:27.570
And he's likely gonna want to do
it over your dead body.

30:27.610 --> 30:29.320
And that's a sacrifice
I'm willing to make.

30:29.370 --> 30:30.490
[Becker]
Open the trunk.

30:30.530 --> 30:31.330
Let's get out of here.

30:31.370 --> 30:32.910
You know, you got lucky.

30:32.950 --> 30:34.540
This whole thing could have went
in an entirely different way.

30:34.580 --> 30:35.660
[siren]

30:35.710 --> 30:36.620
[Becker]
Doyle?

30:36.660 --> 30:38.460
[gunfire]

30:39.210 --> 30:40.330
You double crossed me!

30:40.380 --> 30:41.500
[Becker]
It wasn't me!

30:41.540 --> 30:42.590
[Crocker]
I don't think he's listening.

30:42.630 --> 30:44.460
Boys! Vamoose!

30:44.510 --> 30:45.460
[siren]

30:45.510 --> 30:46.340
We gotta get outa here.

30:46.380 --> 30:47.840
Put Becker in the car.

30:47.880 --> 30:49.300
It's been really nice going down
memory lane with you, pal.

30:49.340 --> 30:50.510
But this is the end of the road.

30:50.550 --> 30:53.140
I can't believe I expected
anything less.

30:53.180 --> 30:54.560
[Becker]
Get in the car.

30:54.600 --> 30:55.560
[Jake]
I'm gonna get you.

30:55.600 --> 30:56.770
Maybe.
We'll see.

30:57.810 --> 30:59.850
[siren]

30:59.900 --> 31:01.110
Don't shoot!

31:05.030 --> 31:05.610
[Leslie]
Drop it!

31:06.320 --> 31:07.400
And get on the ground!

31:07.440 --> 31:08.530
[officer]
Hands up where we can see 'em!

31:08.570 --> 31:10.700
Drop the weapon.

31:11.320 --> 31:12.030
Where's Becker?

31:13.120 --> 31:15.450
Him and Crocker.
They both got away.

31:20.620 --> 31:22.540
The two men worked
for Carlos Romero.

31:22.590 --> 31:24.340
A big-time drug smuggler.

31:24.380 --> 31:25.840
He runs some major international

31:25.880 --> 31:27.590
deals using the east coast
shipping lanes.

31:27.630 --> 31:29.300
Becker had a deal with them
to unload the drugs

31:29.340 --> 31:30.720
and evidence.

31:30.760 --> 31:32.720
Carlos got away with the drugs.
But we'll find him.

31:32.760 --> 31:34.100
What about Tinny?

31:34.140 --> 31:35.140
Becker has his money now.

31:35.180 --> 31:36.430
He doesn't need her any more.

31:37.850 --> 31:38.940
How did you know
where we were?

31:40.020 --> 31:41.190
How did you know
where to find us?

31:41.230 --> 31:42.150
What? You texted me.

31:42.190 --> 31:43.610
No, I didn't.

31:43.650 --> 31:46.070
911. Meet me at the Gut.
Partner.

31:47.610 --> 31:48.900
Partner?

31:50.910 --> 31:52.070
It was Kevin Crocker.

31:52.110 --> 31:53.950
What?
Kevin Crocker sent me this?

31:53.990 --> 31:55.410
He must have grabbed my phone.

31:55.450 --> 31:57.200
I left it on the seat
in the car.

31:57.240 --> 31:58.870
Why would Crocker
alert the police

31:58.910 --> 31:59.870
when he was working for Becker?

31:59.910 --> 32:01.620
It would only complicate things.

32:01.670 --> 32:02.580
I don't know.

32:02.630 --> 32:04.080
Jake.

32:04.130 --> 32:05.920
It's gonna be okay.

32:05.960 --> 32:08.010
You're gonna be okay.
And so will Tinny.

32:08.050 --> 32:10.130
I know. I know.
It's just--

32:10.170 --> 32:10.760
There's always a chance.

32:11.880 --> 32:13.180
[Rose]
Kathleen and I talked to Walter.

32:13.220 --> 32:14.970
He made the deal happen.

32:15.010 --> 32:16.890
Sarah got her immunity
and told us what she knows.

32:16.930 --> 32:18.470
Where are they holding Tinny?

32:18.520 --> 32:20.940
We got four cons spotted robbing
copper wire over at the airport.

32:20.980 --> 32:22.350
And another one

32:22.390 --> 32:25.150
stuck in a vent at a convenience
store on Military Road.

32:25.190 --> 32:26.610
Enough shagging around
with the Doyles. Let's go.

32:27.110 --> 32:28.440
Where is she?

32:28.480 --> 32:30.690
Tinny's at Becker's hideout.
But in hidden room.

32:30.740 --> 32:32.530
A room he used
to stash his contraband booze.

32:32.570 --> 32:34.110
Bennett!

32:34.160 --> 32:36.990
Leslie. I've gotta do this.
I'm gonna do this.

32:37.030 --> 32:39.700
These are unusual circumstances.
Be careful.

32:39.750 --> 32:41.330
I'll see you later.

32:41.370 --> 32:42.540
Count on it.
Mister.

32:43.420 --> 32:44.330
Come on.

32:44.380 --> 32:45.590
[Rose]
Go get Tinny.

32:50.130 --> 32:51.380
[Crocker] You wanna tell me
what the hell that was,

32:51.420 --> 32:52.630
back on the pier?

32:52.670 --> 32:54.470
Doyle must have
called the cops.

32:54.510 --> 32:55.890
You can't trust anyone.

32:55.930 --> 32:58.390
Even with his niece
hanging in the balance.

32:58.430 --> 33:00.100
He could have got us
all killed.

33:00.140 --> 33:02.270
That's why I chose you
over the other low-lifes.

33:02.310 --> 33:04.560
I knew you'd be cool
under pressure.

33:05.940 --> 33:07.940
We have enough cash
to get away now.

33:07.980 --> 33:08.980
And what about Tinny?

33:09.020 --> 33:10.360
We still need her.

33:10.400 --> 33:12.360
As long as Doyle
is on our tails.

33:12.400 --> 33:15.370
Now.
You have something of mine.

33:17.620 --> 33:21.160
And it's in your best interest
to give it back to me.

33:29.670 --> 33:32.090
[Tinny]
You know what Becker is.

33:32.130 --> 33:33.510
What he does to people.

33:33.880 --> 33:35.510
I heard--

33:35.550 --> 33:38.510
he kills people and feeds them
to the pig farm in the Goulds.

33:40.970 --> 33:42.180
I heard that too.

33:43.270 --> 33:44.850
You don't want to be pig feed.

33:44.890 --> 33:47.020
What?
What am I supposed to do now?

33:47.060 --> 33:48.230
Am I supposed to help you?

33:48.270 --> 33:50.730
Be a witness,
or something?

33:50.770 --> 33:52.610
Expect you to look after me?

33:52.650 --> 33:54.530
Yeah. I'll tell the chief that
you were trying to

33:54.570 --> 33:56.030
free me.
You just have to

33:56.070 --> 33:58.280
untie me.
And give me the gun.

33:59.780 --> 34:01.040
And what?
You're gonna look after me?

34:02.540 --> 34:03.410
[door bangs open]

34:04.660 --> 34:05.580
I wasn't gonna

34:05.620 --> 34:06.290
turn you in.
I wasn't.

34:07.460 --> 34:09.290
What the hell is going on?
Who are you?

34:09.330 --> 34:12.380
I came in here with
a business proposition.

34:12.420 --> 34:14.670
But the girl here,
says you can't be trusted.

34:14.720 --> 34:17.050
Says you'll feed me to the pigs.

34:17.090 --> 34:17.800
She's just trying

34:17.840 --> 34:19.180
to get in your head.

34:19.220 --> 34:21.300
I bet she asked if you could
give her your gun too.

34:21.350 --> 34:24.100
She might have.
I wasn't gonna give it to her.

34:24.140 --> 34:25.680
I mean,
I might have thought about it,

34:25.730 --> 34:27.230
'cause she's a cop, but--

34:27.270 --> 34:28.810
Well see if you can point
the gun at the police officer.

34:28.850 --> 34:29.980
Not at me.

34:30.020 --> 34:30.940
Don't listen to him.

34:33.650 --> 34:35.190
I got no choice now,
missy.

34:37.530 --> 34:38.450
[punch]

34:40.370 --> 34:41.160
You alright?

34:41.200 --> 34:42.280
Yeah. Fine. Thanks.

34:42.330 --> 34:43.950
[Becker]
I think it's time to part ways.

34:44.750 --> 34:45.790
Look, you got the cash.

34:45.830 --> 34:46.750
Let Tinny go.

34:46.790 --> 34:48.000
I'll be your hostage.

34:48.040 --> 34:49.420
No. I'm not going without you.

34:49.460 --> 34:51.130
Well, I've got to meet
this certain gentleman.

34:51.170 --> 34:52.130
Part of my deal.

34:52.170 --> 34:53.550
Transportation off this island.

34:53.590 --> 34:54.960
You think
he's going to trust you,

34:55.010 --> 34:56.300
after the cops showed up
at the drop?

34:56.340 --> 34:57.720
Let her go.

34:57.760 --> 34:59.130
I'll get you off the island.

34:59.180 --> 35:00.180
Of course you will.

35:00.220 --> 35:00.760
[bang]

35:01.470 --> 35:03.010
Why did you do that?

35:03.060 --> 35:04.600
[Taylor]
Don't shoot me!

35:05.180 --> 35:06.430
Can't run now?

35:06.480 --> 35:07.850
Can you?

35:07.890 --> 35:09.400
You're coming with me.
A gift to Carlos.

35:09.440 --> 35:10.690
Who wants the man

35:10.730 --> 35:11.770
who called in the cavalry.

35:12.440 --> 35:14.400
I knew it was you.

35:14.440 --> 35:15.900
Very clever.

35:15.940 --> 35:17.190
Grabbing Doyle's phone.

35:17.240 --> 35:20.030
Ah, you got me.
What can I say?

35:20.070 --> 35:20.910
[crunch]

35:20.950 --> 35:22.490
I told you I could help.

35:22.530 --> 35:25.080
He'd be a lot easier to carry
if he was conscious, you tool.

35:25.120 --> 35:26.660
Pick him up.

35:26.700 --> 35:28.410
We got a boat to meet.

35:29.420 --> 35:30.960
[Becker]
I'm sorry.

35:35.630 --> 35:38.550
[gas hisses]

35:38.590 --> 35:39.630
Good luck.

35:53.610 --> 35:54.650
Tinny.

35:54.690 --> 35:55.610
Gas.

35:55.650 --> 35:56.780
Dad! The stove.

36:03.200 --> 36:04.200
Look at me. Stay with me.

36:04.240 --> 36:05.280
You okay?

36:05.330 --> 36:06.330
I'll call an ambulance.

36:06.370 --> 36:07.620
No, wait.

36:07.660 --> 36:08.750
Crocker.

36:08.790 --> 36:10.160
You have to help him.

36:10.210 --> 36:11.540
Becker's gonna kill him.

36:11.580 --> 36:13.210
He tried to help me.

36:13.250 --> 36:14.170
Go.

36:14.210 --> 36:15.210
I'll stay with her.

36:16.340 --> 36:17.880
[Jake]
Meet me at the house, alright?

36:26.510 --> 36:28.140
[Taylor]
It's nothing personal, man.

36:28.180 --> 36:29.220
I just need to--

36:29.270 --> 36:31.140
impress my new employer.

36:31.180 --> 36:32.690
[Crocker] You two should
get along just fine.

36:32.730 --> 36:33.650
You're thick as a plank.

36:33.690 --> 36:34.610
And he's psychotic.

36:34.650 --> 36:35.690
Yo!

36:36.150 --> 36:37.610
[crash]

36:38.150 --> 36:38.940
Nice work.

36:38.980 --> 36:40.190
You okay?

36:40.240 --> 36:42.240
Yeah, I'm fine.
You better go after Becker.

37:03.510 --> 37:04.930
Becker.

37:05.640 --> 37:07.430
Mr. Doyle.

37:07.470 --> 37:08.760
You tried to kill my niece.

37:10.680 --> 37:12.940
You take things so personally.

37:12.980 --> 37:14.270
This as been quite a ride

37:14.310 --> 37:16.610
for you and me, hey?

37:16.650 --> 37:17.440
You know.

37:18.440 --> 37:21.490
I could drown you.
Right here.

37:21.530 --> 37:22.860
Right now.
No one would know.

37:22.900 --> 37:23.950
And no one would care.

37:26.910 --> 37:29.790
[phone rings]

37:30.200 --> 37:31.500
Hello.

37:31.540 --> 37:34.080
[Crocker] Hey. It's me.
Don't hang up. Please.

37:35.170 --> 37:36.960
I just want to know
if she's okay.

37:38.040 --> 37:39.500
Yeah. She's fine.

37:40.250 --> 37:40.760
Good.

37:41.920 --> 37:44.720
Listen.
Can you just tell her that I--

37:49.100 --> 37:50.510
Just tell her goodbye.

37:50.560 --> 37:51.930
Okay.

37:55.270 --> 37:56.770
And I'm sorry.

37:56.810 --> 37:59.020
Sorry for what?

37:59.060 --> 38:00.440
I should have told you.

38:02.150 --> 38:03.570
Goodbye Kevin.

38:13.830 --> 38:16.250
You know.
What was I thinking?

38:16.290 --> 38:20.380
What am I gonna do
with all of this money?

38:20.420 --> 38:25.880
I mean, there's more than enough
to go around.

38:25.920 --> 38:27.300
Fifty-Fifty?

38:27.340 --> 38:29.100
I don't think so.

38:32.640 --> 38:34.390
[Carlos]
You should take the deal.

38:37.730 --> 38:40.270
Coming back here
was a bad idea, man.

38:40.310 --> 38:41.310
Becker.

38:41.360 --> 38:42.690
You and I have business
to finish.

38:43.730 --> 38:45.780
Well. I hate to be
a third wheel.

38:45.820 --> 38:46.530
So I'll tell you what.

38:46.570 --> 38:47.860
I'll get out of your hair

38:47.900 --> 38:49.450
and let you guys finish
your little game of guns.

38:49.990 --> 38:51.330
Right Jake.

38:53.120 --> 38:55.870
And it's my absolute pleasure

38:55.910 --> 38:57.160
to make sure you are

38:57.210 --> 38:58.960
no one's third wheel.

38:59.960 --> 39:01.880
Ever again.

39:03.130 --> 39:04.920
[Carlos]
Gentlemen.

39:08.930 --> 39:10.890
So sorry, Mr. Doyle.

39:26.360 --> 39:27.490
Can I get you anything,
sweetheart?

39:27.530 --> 39:29.200
[Tinny]
I'm fine, mom.

39:33.120 --> 39:35.290
You know he helped me today.

39:35.330 --> 39:36.620
Crocker.

39:37.870 --> 39:39.960
I don't know if he's as bad
as you think.

39:40.000 --> 39:41.130
Well, you might be right.

39:42.750 --> 39:44.000
You're a smart girl.

39:45.050 --> 39:47.510
And I am so, so glad
you're okay.

39:48.300 --> 39:49.180
I'd die without you.

39:52.550 --> 39:53.600
[knocking]

39:54.850 --> 39:56.270
I'm not interrupting,
am I?

39:56.310 --> 39:57.180
No.

39:59.140 --> 40:00.140
I was just leaving.

40:05.730 --> 40:06.650
Hi.

40:06.690 --> 40:07.570
Hi.

40:09.570 --> 40:11.700
Nice work out there.

40:11.740 --> 40:13.070
You're a good cop.

40:14.370 --> 40:15.660
I should have listened to you.

40:16.700 --> 40:17.540
Yeah, well.
You live and learn.

40:18.580 --> 40:19.790
You gonna hold that
against me?

40:22.210 --> 40:23.630
Maybe.

40:23.670 --> 40:25.170
We'll have to see about that,
I s'pose.

40:32.130 --> 40:34.140
Are you sure
this is a good idea?

40:34.180 --> 40:35.260
No.

41:01.450 --> 41:03.210
She's in great spirits.

41:03.250 --> 41:04.370
You did good,
Malachy Doyle.

41:04.420 --> 41:06.540
We did good.
All of us.

41:08.300 --> 41:09.050
[Mal] Hey.

41:09.090 --> 41:10.210
Hey.

41:10.260 --> 41:11.970
Any sign of Jake?
He should be here by now.

41:12.010 --> 41:14.260
Uh, no. I --

41:16.180 --> 41:17.100
No.

41:17.140 --> 41:18.430
[ring]

41:20.310 --> 41:21.560
Leslie?

41:21.600 --> 41:25.150
Mal? I think you're gonna want
to get down here.

41:35.320 --> 41:35.950
What is it?

41:35.990 --> 41:37.200
Is it Jake?

41:37.240 --> 41:38.780
There's no sign of Jake
or Becker anywhere.

41:38.830 --> 41:39.830
What about Crocker?

41:39.870 --> 41:40.490
We found Taylor Gossard

41:40.540 --> 41:41.750
tied up.

41:41.790 --> 41:43.410
Taylor said it was courtesy
of Kevin Crocker.

41:43.460 --> 41:44.670
None of this makes any sense.

41:45.370 --> 41:46.670
We also found these.

41:46.710 --> 41:48.670
Tons.
From automatic weapons.

41:48.710 --> 41:50.090
Carlos's men.

41:50.130 --> 41:50.880
Did you catch--

41:51.460 --> 41:52.920
They're gone.

41:52.970 --> 41:54.590
All of them.

41:57.300 --> 41:59.430
Where is he?

42:08.610 --> 42:10.570
Where the hell am I?

42:26.460 --> 42:27.370
Oh man.
