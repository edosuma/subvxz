01:41.678 --> 01:42.813
- Hi.
- Hey.

01:50.338 --> 01:54.862
- What's going on?
- Nothing.

01:55.790 --> 01:58.790
When something's bothering me, I go running.

01:59.160 --> 02:02.110
You've gone twice in less than 12 hours.

02:07.530 --> 02:08.190
Hello?

02:08.709 --> 02:09.604
Hey, Vaughn.

02:09.961 --> 02:10.951
Yeah, she's right here.

02:13.989 --> 02:14.226
Thanks.

02:16.891 --> 02:17.502
Hey.

02:21.005 --> 02:23.000
Sure. When do you want to meet?

02:23.560 --> 02:25.267
It's definitely my father's handwriting.

02:25.547 --> 02:26.711
But these entries --

02:27.691 --> 02:29.017
- I know.
- I don't understand.

02:29.140 --> 02:30.656
They're dated after his death.

02:30.983 --> 02:33.072
Now you know about as much as I do.

02:33.165 --> 02:35.589
I mean, either he didn't die when the CIA says he did,

02:35.635 --> 02:37.583
which they may or may not know the truth about,

02:37.675 --> 02:39.557
or someone wants me to think he's still alive.

02:39.649 --> 02:41.071
You have nothing else but this?

02:41.165 --> 02:44.066
I tracked down a guy -- Murdoch. He's mentioned in there.

02:44.160 --> 02:47.347
He claims to have been on a mission with my father in 1982.

02:48.328 --> 02:51.230
He says my dad shot him in the back and left him for dead.

02:51.277 --> 02:53.080
He called my father a traitor.

02:54.108 --> 02:55.815
I don't know what to believe.

02:56.936 --> 02:58.072
What do we do?

02:58.211 --> 03:00.348
Well, there are names of classified missions in there.

03:00.442 --> 03:03.486
Let's get the details. I need access to all operational archives.

03:03.625 --> 03:05.047
Now, I could put in a request to Langley --

03:05.141 --> 03:06.897
But if someone is orchestrating this internally,

03:06.989 --> 03:10.083
you don't want your name on an official request. I can do that.

03:11.392 --> 03:12.574
You sure you don't mind?

03:12.669 --> 03:13.373
Vaughn.

03:14.960 --> 03:17.099
If your father's alive, we'll find him.

03:17.518 --> 03:20.516
And if he's not, we will find the person who's doing this.

03:25.095 --> 03:28.857
The Belarussian institute of science has developed a next-gen optical component.

03:28.949 --> 03:30.706
It's called amplifying glass.

03:30.985 --> 03:33.457
Now what is amazing about this is --

03:33.504 --> 03:35.957
well, if my math is correct --

03:36.189 --> 03:37.785
and it is --

03:37.969 --> 03:41.444
what they've developed could boost a laser pulse by a factor of 10,000.

03:41.540 --> 03:42.291
Maybe even higher.

03:42.384 --> 03:45.299
Meaning you could take a simple aluminum gallium arsenide laser and --

03:45.492 --> 03:47.851
uh, let me --

03:47.990 --> 03:51.512
oh, you know how a cd player has a laser that will allow you to --

03:51.559 --> 03:54.079
well, you take that laser, you amplify it by this lens,

03:54.171 --> 03:55.928
you could shoot down a plane from the sky.

03:56.021 --> 03:58.016
Or, you know, you take a tank, slice it in half.

03:58.109 --> 03:59.531
Or you could even have an SUV --

03:59.624 --> 04:00.808
Right. We got it.

04:00.901 --> 04:02.226
We've been tracking intel which indicates

04:02.319 --> 04:04.361
that the Jakarta faction wants the lens

04:04.408 --> 04:06.784
and they've employed this man to acquire it for them.

04:06.877 --> 04:10.209
His name is Cesar Martinez. He's an argentine resident.

04:12.779 --> 04:13.389
Hola.

05:06.726 --> 05:10.249
A few days ago, I tasked Nadia with working up a profile of him.

05:10.528 --> 05:11.663
Martinez is freelance.

05:11.757 --> 05:14.325
No loyalties. Excessive force -- that's his M.O.

05:14.650 --> 05:18.597
He wrote his reputation with the execution of a former argentine intelligence officer --

05:19.072 --> 05:20.034
Roberto Fox.

05:23.117 --> 05:25.732
Any idea when Martinez is planning to make his move?

05:25.823 --> 05:28.588
Signal intercepts indicates that he's developing a team.

05:28.727 --> 05:30.007
It should be three days, a week at the most.

05:30.042 --> 05:32.951
The institute of science is dedicating a new wing

05:33.043 --> 05:34.991
to its research facility tomorrow night.

05:35.084 --> 05:38.749
So our mission is to obtain the amplifying glass before Martinez does.

05:38.889 --> 05:39.929
Sydney, you're on point.

05:40.021 --> 05:42.780
Agent Vaughn, Weiss, and Santos, you'll be there for support.

05:42.967 --> 05:45.200
This is a snatch-and-grab operation.

05:45.806 --> 05:47.132
Are there any questions?

05:49.890 --> 05:50.595
Cesar!

05:53.400 --> 05:54.248
Cesar!

06:26.589 --> 06:27.104
Hey.

06:33.695 --> 06:36.167
I knew him -- Roberto.

06:36.259 --> 06:38.425
The man Cesar Martinez killed.

06:38.611 --> 06:42.325
If this mission is too difficult, too personal for you,

06:43.353 --> 06:45.587
talk to your father and have him task someone else.

06:45.678 --> 06:47.768
It's my job. I'll make it work.

07:28.477 --> 07:30.331
Hey. Mitchell learned a new word.

07:30.515 --> 07:32.846
- What was the word?
- Booshnot.

07:33.031 --> 07:35.454
Mitchell's babyspeak for beta particle.

07:36.529 --> 07:39.622
Uh,  anyway, here -- Sydney wanted me to give you these.

07:40.043 --> 07:41.894
Access codes for the operational archives.

07:41.985 --> 07:44.410
She wanted me to give them to you to give to her.

07:45.016 --> 07:46.534
- Thanks.
- Sure.

07:50.552 --> 07:51.641
Anything else?

07:51.920 --> 07:53.007
What's, uh...

07:54.268 --> 07:55.739
what's going on?

07:56.626 --> 07:57.570
Nothing.

07:59.391 --> 08:01.433
You're lying to me. Right? Come on.

08:01.573 --> 08:02.996
I'm smarter than you think.

08:03.089 --> 08:04.223
I'll  tell you later.

08:04.643 --> 08:05.540
You don't trust me, do you?

08:05.679 --> 08:06.367
Marshall.

08:06.459 --> 08:08.693
Yeah. That's my fault.

08:08.833 --> 08:12.642
I propagate that image. Just like high school, junior high, elementary --

08:12.968 --> 08:13.816
Marshall.

08:14.655 --> 08:17.320
We should have lunch sometime.

08:17.832 --> 08:19.684
Really? Yeah?

08:20.337 --> 08:22.427
Oh, man, anytime. Absolutely. I'm there.

08:22.521 --> 08:23.464
Today?

08:23.790 --> 08:24.592
No.

08:24.777 --> 08:25.962
No. That's cool.

08:26.054 --> 08:29.578
I got a lot of stuff to do in the, uh...

08:30.277 --> 08:31.747
- Thanks.
- You got it.

08:31.840 --> 08:33.118
See you at lunch.

08:34.519 --> 08:35.559
'Sup, buddy?

08:55.658 --> 08:57.176
Outrigger, how we doing?

09:02.023 --> 09:03.339
10 seconds, Phoenix.

09:06.704 --> 09:07.888
The architect just arrived.

09:13.637 --> 09:15.250
He has the PDA in his jacket.

09:16.090 --> 09:18.468
Okay, great. Phoenix, you'll need to get right up next to him.

09:18.793 --> 09:19.785
Cozy like.

09:22.953 --> 09:25.384
The architect is a security freak.

09:25.428 --> 09:27.567
He always carries copies of project files on him --

09:27.706 --> 09:29.319
blueprints, schedules, even sketches.

09:29.411 --> 09:31.692
So should show us which lab the glass is in.

09:31.786 --> 09:33.303
What's she using to clone his PDA?

09:33.395 --> 09:34.150
It's in her purse.

09:34.241 --> 09:36.075
Low-frequency wi-fi scans and clones.

09:36.168 --> 09:38.830
Thing is, its working radius, it's only a couple of feet,

09:38.952 --> 09:40.946
which is why she needs to, you know, get right --

09:41.132 --> 09:42.792
Oh, here it comes.

09:44.521 --> 09:45.370
Oh, great.

09:45.463 --> 09:46.979
Syd -- I'm sorry, Phoenix,

09:47.070 --> 09:48.870
it's what I was afraid of.

09:48.920 --> 09:49.580
It's encrypted.

09:49.620 --> 09:52.140
The PDA -- it's protected with a handwriting recognition software,

09:52.289 --> 09:54.858
so time to turn on the charm.

10:20.664 --> 10:22.898
It's the look, the feel, the bend of paper,

10:23.037 --> 10:25.651
but actually it's a microscopic layer of nonconductive polymer,

10:25.744 --> 10:26.994
- and it's sandwiched --
- Marshall, not the time.

10:28.078 --> 10:30.209
Vaughn asked me to lunch.

10:35.584 --> 10:37.196
Okay. Signature...

10:37.943 --> 10:39.078
plus a password...

10:39.637 --> 10:42.683
plus a little Flinkman secret sauce,

10:44.037 --> 10:45.697
and... nice.

10:45.930 --> 10:48.641
Bow before me and weep, encryption gods.

11:05.394 --> 11:09.203
Okay, blueprints and security protocols for the research facility.

11:10.183 --> 11:11.654
I've got the location of the glass.

11:11.700 --> 11:14.410
Evergreen, we're going to need that access key. You're a go.

11:18.010 --> 11:19.813
Anyone have a visual on the scientist?

11:20.979 --> 11:22.879
He's holding court, due east.

11:36.661 --> 11:37.796
That was easy.

14:04.581 --> 14:06.148
Okay, Merlin, showtime.

14:06.829 --> 14:09.348
The  lab -- it's on the 15th floor. East corridor.

15:29.709 --> 15:30.748
Martinez is here.

15:31.074 --> 15:33.547
Cesar Martinez is in the building.

15:41.352 --> 15:42.679
Anyone see his backup?

15:43.612 --> 15:45.034
Sit tight, Evergreen.

15:45.128 --> 15:46.978
This might be recon on his part.

15:47.117 --> 15:49.781
If this was recon, we would have known he was here.

15:49.873 --> 15:51.008
He's making his play.

15:52.270 --> 15:53.548
- How do you know?
- Trust me.

15:53.687 --> 15:54.518
We need to grab him.

15:54.611 --> 15:57.036
- Phoenix is almost inside.
- You don't understand.

16:05.353 --> 16:08.171
Phoenix, abort. Six hostiles on the move with force.

16:08.265 --> 16:09.066
I can make it.

17:38.056 --> 17:39.633
Who do you work for?

17:40.894 --> 17:43.273
You forgot to say the magic word.

17:55.753 --> 17:57.747
Now you're gonna have to say "pretty please."

17:58.120 --> 17:59.306
Last chance.

18:00.892 --> 18:02.267
Who do you work for?

18:02.827 --> 18:04.249
She works with me.

18:09.110 --> 18:09.959
Nadia?

18:57.940 --> 18:59.933
He had his men secure us in the lab.

19:00.025 --> 19:02.068
By the time we escaped, he was gone.

19:02.302 --> 19:04.822
When I tasked you to do research on Cesar Martinez,

19:04.914 --> 19:07.674
why didn't you inform me the two of you knew each other?

19:07.906 --> 19:09.662
He was not supposed to be there.

19:09.803 --> 19:11.510
I didn't know we'd make contact.

19:12.024 --> 19:15.737
You knowingly withheld intel that would have altered options during the operation.

19:16.484 --> 19:19.290
I've suspended agents from field duty for less than that, Nadia.

19:19.383 --> 19:22.141
Her knowing Martinez was the only thing that saved my life.

19:23.310 --> 19:26.593
The story, Nadia -- what is it?

19:27.246 --> 19:29.527
We met when I was young.

19:29.620 --> 19:31.567
After the orphanage, I was on my own,

19:31.660 --> 19:33.989
and Cesar was one of the boys I ran around with.

19:35.671 --> 19:37.764
We got in trouble with the police.

19:38.087 --> 19:39.796
We went our separate ways.

19:41.524 --> 19:43.376
Why do I feel there's more?

19:44.217 --> 19:47.100
If you want me to sit at a desk after this, fine.

19:47.220 --> 19:49.120
But it is personal now.

19:49.492 --> 19:52.632
Please, let me get the glass back from Cesar.

19:52.959 --> 19:55.096
I know how to contact him. I can do it.

19:55.236 --> 19:58.139
She had a relationship with him. She can use him.

19:59.539 --> 20:02.584
You of all people should appreciate that.

20:04.173 --> 20:05.785
Reach out to Martinez.

20:05.878 --> 20:07.348
He's acquiring this for somebody else.

20:07.441 --> 20:09.435
Find out if we can buy it for ourselves.

20:09.901 --> 20:12.042
Sydney, you and Weiss will be backup on this.

20:13.678 --> 20:15.434
Let me be clear, Nadia.

20:16.929 --> 20:19.019
I expect full disclosure from you.

21:27.378 --> 21:28.036
Bueno.

21:44.162 --> 21:46.872
Withholding information from Sloane I can accept.

21:47.058 --> 21:48.269
I don't care much, really. But from me?

21:48.316 --> 21:50.693
You and I are in the field together.

21:50.740 --> 21:52.448
I need to know there's a level of trust.

21:52.541 --> 21:53.771
What do you want to know?

21:53.957 --> 21:55.665
What did Martinez whisper to you?

21:56.411 --> 21:58.550
I told you. He said "call me."

21:58.736 --> 22:00.254
Sydney, that's it.

22:00.954 --> 22:02.519
Are you telling me there's nothing else?

22:02.894 --> 22:06.780
For the last time, I'm sorry I didn't tell you about Cesar.

22:07.106 --> 22:09.244
But there's nothing else you need to know.

23:17.729 --> 23:18.198
Sí.

23:29.090 --> 23:30.035
How's it going?

23:30.266 --> 23:32.930
I cross-check my father's list against the CIA archives,

23:33.068 --> 23:36.161
and there are still missions I can't verify even existed.

23:38.076 --> 23:41.170
Am I insane to think this old journal's going to help me find my father?

23:42.385 --> 23:44.523
These are the ones you can't find?

23:44.616 --> 23:45.038
Yeah.

23:47.750 --> 23:48.981
Give me the pen.

23:49.634 --> 23:51.392
What if these aren't operation names?

23:52.278 --> 23:53.175
What are you doing?

23:53.453 --> 23:55.591
Substitution cipher.

23:58.256 --> 23:59.771
Okay, how'd you see that?

24:00.146 --> 24:03.429
My father used to encrypt my crossword puzzles when I was a kid.

24:03.801 --> 24:06.178
The least of my childhood dysfunctions.

24:09.682 --> 24:10.626
Try that.

24:11.796 --> 24:12.738
When's your plane leave?

24:12.878 --> 24:14.635
Half an hour.

24:14.681 --> 24:16.246
I wish I could stay.

24:16.975 --> 24:20.211
Yeah, I'll, I'll take it from here.

24:55.502 --> 24:56.305
Nadia.

25:01.025 --> 25:01.665
Hola.

25:02.645 --> 25:03.115
Hola.

25:58.533 --> 26:00.051
Nadia...

27:14.018 --> 27:16.348
Evergreen, you cannot proceed without comms.

27:24.269 --> 27:26.119
Evergreen, abort this mission now.

27:29.579 --> 27:30.523
Nadia...

27:48.022 --> 27:49.566
What the hell is she doing?

28:29.174 --> 28:30.166
Portugal.

29:00.207 --> 29:01.628
All right, I'll go this way.

29:01.722 --> 29:02.051
Okay.

29:46.424 --> 29:47.130
Syd.

29:48.532 --> 29:49.333
Anything?

29:51.670 --> 29:52.471
Ah, come on.

33:26.607 --> 33:27.552
Diego?

33:32.553 --> 33:33.496
Diego.

33:35.693 --> 33:36.589
Dios mío.

33:49.758 --> 33:50.416
No!

34:12.156 --> 34:13.244
Nadia...

34:21.422 --> 34:21.985
No.

34:23.763 --> 34:24.467
No.

34:38.744 --> 34:40.737
Diego. Diego.

34:41.440 --> 34:42.719
Diego!

35:59.981 --> 36:01.689
We lost him here at Plaza Del Camino.

36:01.829 --> 36:03.634
Yeah, Martinez said he was taking her to his office

36:03.725 --> 36:05.242
to make the exchange. It's got to be close.

36:05.382 --> 36:08.236
Since learning of Nadia's history with Martinez, I did some digging.

36:08.421 --> 36:10.655
Martinez owns several pieces of property,

36:10.748 --> 36:14.457
including Roberto Fox's training facility.

38:01.005 --> 38:02.056
Nadia.

39:58.817 --> 39:59.665
Nadia!

40:02.471 --> 40:03.081
Nadia.

40:03.406 --> 40:04.762
I'm fine.

40:05.555 --> 40:06.690
There's a safe inside.

40:06.830 --> 40:08.347
The amplifying glass should be there.

40:08.440 --> 40:09.480
All right, come on.

41:04.034 --> 41:06.267
The first and only time I met your father,

41:06.407 --> 41:09.261
he was covered in blood with a baby in his arms.

41:09.353 --> 41:10.108
Nadia.

41:10.295 --> 41:13.195
He brought her to the orphanage in Buenos Aires.

41:13.428 --> 41:15.328
He said she was in danger.

41:15.607 --> 41:18.059
He'd been shot in the shoulder.

41:18.431 --> 41:20.761
I knew not to ask too many questions.

41:21.602 --> 41:23.884
Your father, he stayed for a few days,

41:24.257 --> 41:27.111
until he was well enough to travel.

41:27.485 --> 41:29.671
One morning I woke up and he was gone.

41:31.960 --> 41:33.284
I don't understand.

41:33.378 --> 41:34.753
If he knew you in Buenos Aires,

41:34.892 --> 41:39.131
why would he encode this address in Lisbon in his journal?

41:39.270 --> 41:40.693
I don't know.

41:42.140 --> 41:45.471
You thought he might be here.

41:46.919 --> 41:48.340
I am sorry.

41:49.537 --> 41:51.579
I wish I knew more.

41:52.139 --> 41:55.518
Can you remember anything? Something he said, maybe a detail?

41:58.510 --> 41:59.931
Nightingale.

42:00.865 --> 42:01.762
Nightingale?

42:02.276 --> 42:07.660
He was on the phone, and something in his voice --

42:07.798 --> 42:09.508
It was important to him.

42:15.255 --> 42:17.154
May I ask you a question?

42:18.865 --> 42:19.618
Sure.

42:20.833 --> 42:24.116
Nadia -- how is she?

42:24.629 --> 42:25.765
She's good.
