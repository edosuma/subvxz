WEBVTT

00:01.035 --> 00:02.570
Scrub in with The Resident.

00:02.603 --> 00:04.638
This is a business.
It's not a charity.

00:04.672 --> 00:06.574
Catch all-new episodes Mondays,

00:06.607 --> 00:08.542
and check out
our other Fox programs--

00:08.576 --> 00:11.912
9-1-1, Lethal Weapon,
and Empire.

00:11.945 --> 00:14.248
We lost Empire,
but we are still here.

00:14.282 --> 00:15.749
Only on Fox.

00:17.051 --> 00:18.252
-Previously on The Resident...
-You may not realize

00:18.286 --> 00:20.321
this yet, but we're a thing.

00:20.354 --> 00:22.590
DEVON: Where can I get
an amazing present for Priya?

00:22.623 --> 00:24.925
I'll take that one.
This will definitely work.

00:24.958 --> 00:26.994
You do whatever
the hell I tell you,

00:27.027 --> 00:28.862
no questions asked.

00:28.896 --> 00:30.398
You came in here ready
to save lives,

00:30.431 --> 00:32.766
but today,
you saved a brain stem

00:32.800 --> 00:35.035
-'cause you didn't listen to me.
-You look well.

00:35.069 --> 00:37.405
-Atlanta suits you.

00:37.438 --> 00:39.873
I'm looking for worthwhile
investment opportunities.

00:39.907 --> 00:43.010
Making you CEO was
the smartest thing we ever did.

00:43.043 --> 00:46.046
I want to introduce you to your
new boss, Marshall Winthrop.

00:49.083 --> 00:51.419
* You feel like summertime... *

00:51.452 --> 00:54.622
MICAH: Thank you for busting me
out of that hospital room.

00:54.655 --> 00:56.857
MINA: This is what you need.
Fresh air.

00:56.890 --> 00:58.592
MICAH:
No, no, no, don't. I got it.

00:58.626 --> 01:01.129
People will have to take care
of you for a while, Micah.

01:01.162 --> 01:03.297
Relax and get used to it.

01:03.331 --> 01:05.399
Yeah, the invalid thing?
Not my style.

01:05.433 --> 01:07.435
You're ten days
out of major surgery.

01:07.468 --> 01:09.069
Yeah. I get that.

01:09.103 --> 01:10.771
But you know.

01:10.804 --> 01:12.440
What's wrong?

01:12.473 --> 01:16.377
No one wants to talk
about what's ahead for me.

01:16.410 --> 01:18.379
Tell me the truth.

01:18.412 --> 01:19.413
What's the average
life expectancy of someone

01:19.447 --> 01:21.382
after a heart transplant?

01:21.415 --> 01:24.452
You're not average.

01:24.485 --> 01:27.087
You're young and you're strong.

01:27.121 --> 01:29.923
Micah, we almost lost you.

01:29.957 --> 01:32.493
Let's just enjoy this moment.

01:32.526 --> 01:35.296
Right here, right now.

01:35.329 --> 01:39.167
Isn't life beautiful?

01:39.200 --> 01:42.503
You are what's beautiful.

01:42.536 --> 01:45.906
* Do love me, do love me, do,
do love me, do love me, do... *

01:45.939 --> 01:48.409
PRIYA :
Oh!

01:48.442 --> 01:50.344
DEVON: Priya, we have
to discipline this dog.

01:50.378 --> 01:52.780
Bad doggy.

01:52.813 --> 01:57.285
Bad, naughty little
baby puppy-wuppy.

01:57.318 --> 01:59.287
-That showed him.
-Jellybean has got to be

01:59.320 --> 02:00.854
at the wedding.

02:00.888 --> 02:02.756
No, no, not the wedding.

02:02.790 --> 02:04.625
We were having
such a nice night.

02:04.658 --> 02:06.794
Have you arranged for someone
to teach you Bhangra?

02:06.827 --> 02:11.665
-A Bollywood dance
would be so much fun.

02:11.699 --> 02:14.868
You can do it for me,
can't you?

02:14.902 --> 02:16.904
All right.

02:18.739 --> 02:21.342
You have to make sure
the fish isn't overcooked.

02:21.375 --> 02:23.944
Three minutes a side.

02:23.977 --> 02:27.715
And then... taste this.

02:31.319 --> 02:33.954
-Mmm.

02:33.987 --> 02:35.556
This new night nurse

02:35.589 --> 02:37.958
keeps texting me
about her COPD patient.

02:37.991 --> 02:39.560
It's good, though, right?

02:39.593 --> 02:40.994
I hope so.

02:41.028 --> 02:42.630
Are we talking
about the same thing?

02:42.663 --> 02:44.865
-Chastain.
-Veggie kabob.

02:46.900 --> 02:49.303
Delicious.

02:49.337 --> 02:53.307
-Mullins is out of the ICU.

02:53.341 --> 02:54.742
-Hey.
-Hey.

02:54.775 --> 02:55.909
-Give that back.
-Hey, hey.

02:55.943 --> 02:57.311
-Give me my phone.
-Date night, date night.

02:57.345 --> 02:58.712
We are off duty.

02:58.746 --> 03:01.148
Oh, says the guy
who's never off duty.

03:01.181 --> 03:05.386
* All I wanna do
is let you shine *

03:05.419 --> 03:07.355
* Do love me, do love me, do *

03:07.388 --> 03:10.424
* I love you, do love me,
do love me, do *

03:10.458 --> 03:11.992
* Do love me, do love me, do *

03:12.025 --> 03:13.394
* Put no one else above you *

03:13.427 --> 03:15.563
* Do love me, do love me, do *

03:15.596 --> 03:16.697
* Do love me,
do love me, do. *

03:32.646 --> 03:35.383
Who was she?

03:40.321 --> 03:42.323
Love of my life.

03:45.058 --> 03:46.860
Turned out to be
a psychopathic doctor

03:46.894 --> 03:48.729
who poisoned her own patients.

03:51.665 --> 03:54.568
She's in jail for murder.

03:57.004 --> 03:59.039
You have a nice night.

03:59.072 --> 04:01.375
* Mm, mm, mm *

04:01.409 --> 04:04.044
* Mm, mm, mm, mm *

04:04.077 --> 04:07.247
* Oh, no, the vertigo's coming *

04:07.281 --> 04:09.817
* Can't keep me on my feet *

04:09.850 --> 04:12.453
* God knows I'm trying
to be someone *

04:12.486 --> 04:15.756
* My vision's failing me *

04:15.789 --> 04:19.259
* I live like
I'm dying tomorrow *

04:19.293 --> 04:21.462
* God gave me one last chance *

04:21.495 --> 04:24.665
* To take all the time
that I've borrowed *

04:24.698 --> 04:28.302
* And make a new man *

04:28.336 --> 04:31.772
* Feels like I'm burning out *

04:31.805 --> 04:33.674
* Wondering why it changed *

04:33.707 --> 04:38.111
* Bring back this life of mine *

04:38.145 --> 04:40.013
* 'Cause it left with you *

04:40.047 --> 04:42.350
* Take it day to day *

04:42.383 --> 04:44.418
* I'm trying *

04:44.452 --> 04:48.689
* Trying to block the memories *

04:48.722 --> 04:50.624
* In my head *

04:50.658 --> 04:53.193
* They said pain,
it comes in waves *

04:53.226 --> 04:56.530
* So dive in *

04:56.564 --> 04:59.600
* They weren't lying *

04:59.633 --> 05:03.804
* There's no denying it *

05:13.647 --> 05:16.149
Uh, you look a lot like her.

05:16.183 --> 05:19.286
-I can make you forget her.
-Don't talk.

05:19.319 --> 05:21.221
Your voice, it's not the same.

05:29.997 --> 05:31.632
You're under arrest
for solicitation.

05:34.602 --> 05:37.337
* I knew that it will
come for me *

05:37.371 --> 05:40.408
* So why try to run? *

05:40.441 --> 05:43.511
* I knew it will come for me. *

05:45.913 --> 05:47.915
*

06:01.261 --> 06:04.765
Here you go. Should fit.

06:06.467 --> 06:09.036
Thanks for arranging bail.

06:09.069 --> 06:12.239
I just made CEO.
Can we keep this quiet?

06:12.272 --> 06:14.708
We need a not guilty verdict.

06:14.742 --> 06:16.176
If you're convicted
for solicitation,

06:16.209 --> 06:17.745
the law says
you have to report the arrest

06:17.778 --> 06:18.979
to the state medical board.

06:23.083 --> 06:26.787
*

06:26.820 --> 06:31.825
* Yeah... *

06:34.562 --> 06:37.598
* Yeah, yeah *

06:37.631 --> 06:39.066
* You've got to show me love *

06:43.437 --> 06:45.305
* Heartbreaks and promises *

06:45.338 --> 06:50.277
* I've had more than my share *

06:50.310 --> 06:53.046
* I'm tired of giving my love *

06:53.080 --> 06:55.415
* And getting nowhere... *

06:55.449 --> 06:58.051
-Yeah.

06:58.085 --> 06:59.319
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

06:59.352 --> 07:00.754
Look out!

07:04.825 --> 07:07.595
BOY:
Hey. You okay?

07:07.628 --> 07:09.797
Help, I...

07:09.830 --> 07:11.431
I-I can't breathe.

07:11.465 --> 07:13.266
Someone call 911.

07:13.300 --> 07:15.936
Teenage male,
blunt abdominal trauma.

07:15.969 --> 07:17.337
Pullman Yard, the meadow.

07:17.370 --> 07:18.672
Roger that.

07:18.706 --> 07:21.975
Medivac Midtown, we have a call.

07:22.009 --> 07:23.577
MIDTOWN PARAMEDIC:
Call received.

07:23.611 --> 07:25.245
En route to Pullman Yard.

07:25.278 --> 07:28.582
Medivac Midtown just got
a call to Pullman Yard.

07:28.616 --> 07:30.150
See if you can beat
them to the scene.

07:30.183 --> 07:32.285
AIRMED PARAMEDIC:
Copy you. AirMed Atlanta

07:32.319 --> 07:34.855
turning around and heading
to Pullman Yard.

07:34.888 --> 07:37.157
AirMed Atlanta just launched.

07:37.190 --> 07:38.526
They're trying to poach a call,
but we can

07:38.559 --> 07:39.993
-get there first.
-PARAMEDIC: On my way.

07:40.027 --> 07:41.461
You'll be fine.

07:41.495 --> 07:44.164
Where the hell is the ambulance?

07:50.904 --> 07:53.240
MIDTOWN PARAMEDIC:
What the hell?

08:05.085 --> 08:06.554
Look, there's two of them.

08:06.587 --> 08:08.155
There's three of them.

08:14.061 --> 08:16.530
You're okay. Just hold on.

08:20.067 --> 08:22.002
MIDTOWN PARAMEDIC:
AirMed Atlanta again?

08:41.955 --> 08:45.158
This is our call!
-Pullman Yard is zone three.

08:45.192 --> 08:47.928
-AirMed Atlanta has zone three.
-Oh, you poached
off the police scanner.

08:47.961 --> 08:49.730
-That's the third time...
-Yeah, after you took
one of ours last week.

08:49.763 --> 08:51.899
Okay, we got you, buddy.
You'll be in the ER in no time.

08:51.932 --> 08:53.934
-Jack.

08:53.967 --> 08:55.535
Jack? All right,
where does it hurt

08:55.569 --> 08:57.037
Severe abdominal trauma.

08:57.070 --> 08:58.606
All right, Jack,
I need you to keep still.

08:58.639 --> 08:59.873
We're gonna put a collar on you.

08:59.907 --> 09:01.041
MIDTOWN PARAMEDIC:
Two weeks ago, Piedmont Park.

09:01.074 --> 09:03.276
-Tell me that wasn't you.
-Okay, that was me,

09:03.310 --> 09:04.978
but that was because
that patient needed help.

09:09.316 --> 09:12.119
Today I got here first!

09:12.152 --> 09:14.387
-Southeast Air Ambulance One...
-Hey, hey, hey. Wait, wait!

09:14.421 --> 09:16.757
...we have patient,
inbound to Chastain Park.

09:27.668 --> 09:29.637
DEVON:
All right, it's on, Mina.

09:29.670 --> 09:32.139
-Oh, no, no, no.

09:32.172 --> 09:34.407
-Oh, okay, all right.
That's the best you got?
-You won.

09:34.441 --> 09:36.576
-Serious question right now.
-Oh, laugh while you still can,
my friend.

09:36.610 --> 09:39.412
-Very serious question:
is that all you got?

09:39.446 --> 09:42.549
-Good job.
-Dr. Pravesh. Just the man
we were looking for.

09:42.582 --> 09:44.584
Time to grow up
and be a role model.

09:44.618 --> 09:45.986
First year med students.

09:46.019 --> 09:47.788
-Aw.
-Green as new mown grass.

09:47.821 --> 09:49.489
CONRAD:
They get to tour the hospital,

09:49.522 --> 09:51.959
and guess who has the honor
of showing them the ropes?

09:51.992 --> 09:53.661
Oh, no. No, no, no, no, no.

09:53.694 --> 09:54.995
Please, I have,
I have patients to see.

09:55.028 --> 09:56.463
CONRAD:
Take them with.

09:56.496 --> 09:58.398
Impart your wisdom.

09:58.431 --> 10:01.234
-Be their Conrad.
-Conrad 2.0.

10:01.268 --> 10:03.336
Uh, no. No. No.

10:03.370 --> 10:05.973
Hi. Aaron Holt.

10:06.006 --> 10:07.240
Hey.

10:07.274 --> 10:10.477
-Justin.
-Okay, okay.

10:11.611 --> 10:13.613
Hi. All right. Uh...

10:13.647 --> 10:16.149
Yes, thank you.

10:20.888 --> 10:22.856
CONRAD:
You wanted to see me?

10:22.890 --> 10:24.291
No.

10:24.324 --> 10:26.026
He did.

10:27.627 --> 10:29.596
In my opinion,
it's wholly inappropriate

10:29.629 --> 10:31.999
for a third year resident to
attend a meeting between the CEO

10:32.032 --> 10:33.533
and the chairman of the board.

10:33.566 --> 10:37.004
We're discussing recent
unfortunate events at Chastain.

10:37.037 --> 10:39.840
Residents are on the frontline
of patient care.

10:39.873 --> 10:41.775
I want my son's input.

10:41.809 --> 10:45.779
Conrad, if you had a magic wand,

10:45.813 --> 10:48.481
what would you do first
to improve the hospital?

10:48.515 --> 10:50.150
Easy, weed out
problematic staff.

10:50.183 --> 10:52.152
Starting with a resident
who breaks the rules

10:52.185 --> 10:53.553
whenever he damn well pleases?

10:53.586 --> 10:54.888
Excellence comes
from the top down.

10:54.922 --> 10:57.024
MARSHALL:
What is your plan

10:57.057 --> 10:59.960
-to balance the budget,
Dr. Bell?
-Increase volume.

10:59.993 --> 11:02.029
Screen patients, cut those
at risk for nonpayment.

11:02.062 --> 11:04.197
Every single one of those ideas
threatens patient safety.

11:04.231 --> 11:06.066
This is a business,
it's not a charity.

11:06.099 --> 11:07.801
No money, no mission.

11:07.835 --> 11:09.870
Okay, you want to go there?
Yeah, let's go there.

11:09.903 --> 11:11.972
-A million five.

11:12.005 --> 11:14.674
A million five. Why does
Dr. Bell make a million five

11:14.708 --> 11:17.177
when the average
hospital CEO salary is $600,000?

11:17.210 --> 11:19.880
I'm not average.

11:19.913 --> 11:22.249
The CEO at Atlanta General
makes $3 million.

11:22.282 --> 11:24.184
We both earn every penny.

11:24.217 --> 11:27.020
You have no idea
what this job entails.

11:27.054 --> 11:29.222
All ten floors of this hospital
rest on my back.

11:29.256 --> 11:32.926
There are 30 departments,
45 surgeons, 200 internists,

11:32.960 --> 11:34.928
ten CT scanners that do not

11:34.962 --> 11:37.731
and will never pay
for themselves.

11:37.765 --> 11:40.700
And while you are feeling
the pain and triumph

11:40.734 --> 11:42.402
of helping a relative few,

11:42.435 --> 11:45.939
I will be thinking of ways
to raise or cut a dollar

11:45.973 --> 11:48.008
so that I can keep you working,

11:48.041 --> 11:50.210
nurses attending,
janitors cleaning,

11:50.243 --> 11:51.611
those machines humming,

11:51.644 --> 11:53.046
so Chastain's patients
keep breathing.

11:53.080 --> 11:55.715
-Exhibit A.

11:55.749 --> 11:58.418
A medevac helicopter
coming here,

11:58.451 --> 12:01.621
and n Atlanta General.

12:01.654 --> 12:04.191
Why? Because I pushed Chastain

12:04.224 --> 12:06.593
to buy that air transport
company so it brings patients

12:06.626 --> 12:08.962
to our top-of-the-line,
level one trauma center.

12:08.996 --> 12:11.298
Perfect example
of profits over patients.

12:11.331 --> 12:13.300
Air ambulances used
to be run by the county.

12:13.333 --> 12:16.804
Now they're for-profit.
You know how much we charge

12:16.837 --> 12:18.738
for that ten
40 grand.

12:18.772 --> 12:20.440
You could fly around the world
ten times...

12:20.473 --> 12:22.375
Insurance pays.
It's not our problem.

12:22.409 --> 12:24.111
News flash. Millions of people
are uninsured.

12:24.144 --> 12:25.879
That flight could
equal bankruptcy.

12:25.913 --> 12:28.048
-Well, that's the option--

12:28.081 --> 12:30.283
-Gentlemen, enough.

12:30.317 --> 12:33.553
I set up this meeting
to find solutions.

12:33.586 --> 12:36.289
Chastain needs revenue
to make payroll.

12:36.323 --> 12:38.758
It also needs
to be a beacon of excellence.

12:38.792 --> 12:40.560
You both have a point.

12:40.593 --> 12:43.330
You're gonna have
to learn to work together.

12:56.043 --> 12:58.445
HUNDLEY:
How long have you been diabetic?

12:58.478 --> 13:02.015
Since I was ten.
Three years.

13:02.049 --> 13:05.118
Because you're a minor,
we have to wait on your mom.

13:05.152 --> 13:07.187
Okay.

13:07.220 --> 13:10.523
Take a seat, and when
she gets here, come back, okay?

13:12.159 --> 13:13.827
14-year-old male,

13:13.861 --> 13:16.463
skating accident,
abdominal trauma, BP 80/40

13:16.496 --> 13:19.366
-and dropping. Pulse is 126.
-All right, Trauma Ten.

13:19.399 --> 13:20.767
-Jack Alderwood.

13:20.800 --> 13:22.335
-Everywhere.

13:22.369 --> 13:24.671
-Jack! Ja-- T-That's our son!
-All right, on a scale...

13:24.704 --> 13:26.806
Sir, we're gonna take care
of him, I promise you.

13:26.840 --> 13:28.041
-We just need some space.
-The doctors

13:28.075 --> 13:29.542
are taking good care
of your son.

13:29.576 --> 13:31.845
On a scale of one to ten,
ten being

13:31.879 --> 13:34.181
-the most severe...
-Ten. Can't breathe.

13:34.214 --> 13:36.716
Okay, here's my credit card
and insurance.

13:36.749 --> 13:38.551
-Let's get you
to registration, okay?
-Right now. One, two, three.

13:38.585 --> 13:40.653
We need another large-bore IV.

13:40.687 --> 13:44.124
Hang one liter normal saline,
get blood ready.

13:44.157 --> 13:45.625
Trauma to the upper abdomen.

13:45.658 --> 13:47.594
He's distended, diffuse pain.

13:50.430 --> 13:52.966
Okay, hang in there, buddy.
You're doing great.

13:53.000 --> 13:55.702
His FAST is positive. Free fluid
everywhere. He's bleeding out.

13:55.735 --> 13:57.837
Hang two units O neg.
Don't worry.

13:57.871 --> 14:00.908
We're gonna take care of you.
He needs an OR.

14:00.941 --> 14:03.010
-Bowel surgery.
Busy for another three hours.

14:03.043 --> 14:05.412
-CONRAD:
Who's available from trauma?
-AUSTIN: I am.

14:05.445 --> 14:07.380
-You're cardiothoracic.
-Well, actually,

14:07.414 --> 14:09.749
I'm triple board certified--
cardiothoracic,

14:09.782 --> 14:12.685
general and trauma. I'm also IFR
licensed on a twin engine plane,

14:12.719 --> 14:14.754
and I can scuba dive
up to 150 feet.

14:14.787 --> 14:16.323
Kill me now.

14:18.391 --> 14:20.360
All right, he's out.

14:20.393 --> 14:22.295
CONRAD:
Let's get him to OR One.

14:25.698 --> 14:29.669
Let's look in on your very first
patient. And don't be nervous.

14:29.702 --> 14:31.471
There are no wrong answers.

14:33.440 --> 14:35.608
Mr. Warden,
these are medical students

14:35.642 --> 14:37.577
rounding
for the very first time.

14:37.610 --> 14:39.179
I'd like them to listen
to your heart.

14:39.212 --> 14:40.580
Would that be all right
with you?

14:40.613 --> 14:43.083
-Sure. Have at it, Doc.
-All right.

14:49.589 --> 14:52.625
DEVON: Heart sounds are
notoriously tricky, but they are

14:52.659 --> 14:55.462
a key diagnostic tool.
So, what do you think...?

14:55.495 --> 14:57.730
I can clearly hear a diastolic
rumble with an opening snap,

14:57.764 --> 14:59.632
which is indicative
of mitral stenosis

14:59.666 --> 15:02.202
secondary
to rheumatic heart disease.

15:02.235 --> 15:04.904
Actually, I hear a crescendo
decrescendo systolic ejection

15:04.938 --> 15:06.639
murmur radiating
to the carotids,

15:06.673 --> 15:08.541
with soft S2
and precordial thrill.

15:08.575 --> 15:13.146
You know, I kind of just think
it sounds like Ken-tucky.

15:13.180 --> 15:14.647
And sometimes,
it kind of sounds like

15:14.681 --> 15:16.783
Tennes-see, Tennes-see,

15:16.816 --> 15:18.351
-Tennes-see.

15:20.787 --> 15:24.791
Um... I didn't really hear
anything abnormal.

15:24.824 --> 15:28.228
I thought I was in
for gallbladder surgery?

15:28.261 --> 15:30.730
You are. You have
a perfectly normal heart.

15:30.763 --> 15:34.367
Are you sure? I distinctly
heard a diastolic...

15:36.769 --> 15:38.972
Thank you. Let's go.

16:16.743 --> 16:20.147
It's, uh, pretty quiet up here.
Couldn't we go to the ER, OR?

16:20.180 --> 16:22.449
-See some trauma,
you know, blood and gore?

16:22.482 --> 16:24.984
It's your first day.
Just do what I tell you to do,

16:25.018 --> 16:26.653
-no questions asked.
-NONI: Heads up.

16:26.686 --> 16:28.955
There's a device rep
in the conference room,

16:28.988 --> 16:31.858
luring in doctors to hear
her sales pitch. Free Thai food.

16:31.891 --> 16:33.193
-Oh.

16:40.867 --> 16:42.402
WOMAN:
Come on in, guys.

16:42.435 --> 16:43.836
-Have some food.
-Thank you.

16:43.870 --> 16:45.105
-Mm-hmm. You're welcome.
-Thank you.

16:48.108 --> 16:49.809
Come on in, Doctor.

16:49.842 --> 16:52.245
I'm Julian Booth,
device rep for Quovadis.

16:52.279 --> 16:54.347
Hi. Uh, Dr. Pravesh.

16:54.381 --> 16:56.683
Um... Devon.

16:56.716 --> 17:00.053
I have some cool gear
to show you.

17:00.087 --> 17:02.155
Let's see what you might need.

17:02.189 --> 17:03.856
You're not a surgeon.

17:03.890 --> 17:05.558
How do you know that?

17:05.592 --> 17:06.993
It's my superpower.

17:07.026 --> 17:09.062
I can guess a doctor's specialty
at a glance,

17:09.096 --> 17:10.597
even before they know it.

17:10.630 --> 17:12.565
Take your medical students.

17:12.599 --> 17:15.235
Born rad.
Destined to spend his life

17:15.268 --> 17:17.237
inside windowless rooms
with imaging machines.

17:17.270 --> 17:18.738
He does look like a submariner.

17:18.771 --> 17:20.107
Mm-hmm.

17:20.140 --> 17:22.675
Okay, what about that one
over there?

17:22.709 --> 17:24.211
Peeds.

17:24.244 --> 17:25.945
No way.
My money's on derm.

17:25.978 --> 17:27.980
No, I'm right.

17:33.286 --> 17:35.588
That is impressive.

17:35.622 --> 17:40.227
Good, right? And your shy one
will probably cure cancer.

17:40.260 --> 17:42.229
All right,
the one on the end here.

17:42.262 --> 17:44.764
Annoying gunner

17:44.797 --> 17:46.566
No. He'll get his MD,

17:46.599 --> 17:48.968
skip residency and head straight
to Silicon Valley.

17:49.001 --> 17:50.603
That's what
all the gunners do.

17:50.637 --> 17:52.772
They invent devices like these.

17:52.805 --> 17:54.874
Artificial sphincter.

17:54.907 --> 17:56.576
-You laugh,

17:56.609 --> 17:58.478
but the urologist
who came up with this

17:58.511 --> 17:59.946
hauled down $40 million.

17:59.979 --> 18:02.949
-You're kidding.
-Medical devices

18:02.982 --> 18:04.484
are even bigger than pharma.

18:04.517 --> 18:06.453
Pacemakers, cardiac caths,

18:06.486 --> 18:10.056
cochlear implants,
artificial knees, skin, hips.

18:10.089 --> 18:13.726
I was a dancer until one day
I was hit by a car.

18:13.760 --> 18:15.628
It shattered my pelvis.

18:15.662 --> 18:19.266
A total hip replacement
gave me my life back

18:19.299 --> 18:20.867
and made me a true believer.

18:22.769 --> 18:24.637
You're interested in ER, right?

18:26.173 --> 18:27.440
Okay, now you're batting
a thousand.

18:27.474 --> 18:29.742
You won't be
just a doctor, though.

18:29.776 --> 18:31.110
You're too smart for that.

18:31.144 --> 18:34.681
All the best ones do more
than one thing.

18:34.714 --> 18:36.616
Maybe you'll invent
one of these.

18:39.152 --> 18:40.987
-No. I'm good.

18:41.020 --> 18:43.022
-Thank you.
-You never know.

18:43.055 --> 18:45.792
-$40 million.

18:47.527 --> 18:50.096
Jack came through the
splenectomy with flying colors.

18:50.129 --> 18:51.598
-Thank God.
-Oh.

18:51.631 --> 18:53.600
I don't know what we would
do if we lost him.

18:53.633 --> 18:55.702
He's the center
of our world. Jack is

18:55.735 --> 18:57.870
the brightest, kindest...

18:57.904 --> 19:02.342
This boy is the only thing
that pulled us through when...

19:02.375 --> 19:06.213
Amber, Jack's sister, passed two
years ago from a brain tumor.

19:10.350 --> 19:12.485
Am I okay?

19:12.519 --> 19:14.354
Yes, darling.
-Hey, buddy.

19:14.387 --> 19:16.189
You're gonna be fine.
Isn't he, Dr. Hawkins?

19:16.223 --> 19:20.293
Yeah. Jack, we had to do a
procedure to remove your spleen.

19:20.327 --> 19:23.029
Spleen filters blood, helps
your body fight infections,

19:23.062 --> 19:24.664
so you'll need
a regular schedule of vaccines,

19:24.697 --> 19:26.366
but other than that, you won't
even know it's missing.

19:26.399 --> 19:29.001
Hear that, Mom?
It's okay.

19:31.037 --> 19:33.039
She worries.

19:38.678 --> 19:42.014
Why don't you two get some food
while I do a post

19:42.048 --> 19:43.550
Okay, okay.

19:43.583 --> 19:45.718
And thank you, Dr. Hawkins.

20:01.100 --> 20:03.102
Looks like you have
a touch of jaundice.

20:03.135 --> 20:05.238
Is that serious?

20:05.272 --> 20:07.274
Not necessarily.

20:07.307 --> 20:09.909
Tell me about your weight.
Any changes lately?

20:09.942 --> 20:11.611
You're a thin guy.

20:11.644 --> 20:13.680
I just dropped ten pounds.

20:13.713 --> 20:16.416
I wasn't even trying,
but I like it.

20:16.449 --> 20:19.185
How were you feeling before
the accident

20:19.218 --> 20:23.423
I have been having some
back pain, but it's no big deal.

20:23.456 --> 20:25.425
Probably pulled a muscle
roller dancing.

20:25.458 --> 20:27.093
Show me where it hurts.

20:42.141 --> 20:45.412
: Ow. Ah.
-I'm sorry to hear
about your sister.

20:45.445 --> 20:48.114
Any other history of cancer
in the family?

20:51.951 --> 20:55.054
My grandfather died young.

20:55.087 --> 20:56.923
I never knew him.

20:56.956 --> 20:59.559
Colon cancer, I think.

20:59.592 --> 21:02.829
And Mom had breast cancer,
but she's okay now.

21:06.165 --> 21:09.569
Have to run a few more tests
before I can let you go.

21:09.602 --> 21:11.338
I'll go write up the orders.

21:29.722 --> 21:31.223
Can I help you?

21:36.228 --> 21:38.531
Hey, call security.
We got a drug seeker.

21:39.632 --> 21:42.635
Hey! Hey!

21:48.741 --> 21:52.612
Okay, every doctor needs
to know how to place an IV.

21:52.645 --> 21:54.481
I want you
to practice on each other.

21:57.817 --> 21:59.619
Good work.

21:59.652 --> 22:01.354
This is child's play.

22:01.388 --> 22:04.323
Did all summer
in my Dad's neurosurgery clinic.

22:08.327 --> 22:11.330
Steady. Steady. Steady.

22:15.868 --> 22:18.004
See, this is why
you're going into radiology.

22:18.037 --> 22:20.006
DEVON:
Steady.

22:20.039 --> 22:21.974
Just watch.

22:22.008 --> 22:24.677
-Feel it. Touch it.
There you go, you feel that?
-Uh-huh.

22:24.711 --> 22:26.746
-Uh-huh.
-That's the vein.
That's where you want to go.

22:26.779 --> 22:29.449
-The pulsing thing.
-Mm-hmm.

22:32.184 --> 22:33.352
DEVON:
Lower your hand.

22:33.386 --> 22:35.021
Can I get a new partner?

22:35.054 --> 22:36.389
He-he can't find the vein.

22:36.423 --> 22:38.190
Maybe I can help.

22:38.224 --> 22:39.526
Here.

22:39.559 --> 22:41.027
Try this.

22:41.060 --> 22:42.995
It uses infrared
to find the vein.

22:43.029 --> 22:44.764
-Here you go.
-Oh.

22:44.797 --> 22:45.998
-There you go,
that's it right there.

22:46.032 --> 22:47.366
STUDENT:
That right there?

22:47.400 --> 22:49.469
Yeah.

22:51.103 --> 22:52.304
STUDENT:
Got it.

22:55.642 --> 22:59.011
I did it.

22:59.045 --> 23:00.246
T-This device rocks.

23:00.279 --> 23:01.914
-Whoa!
-Oh!

23:01.948 --> 23:04.116
You have to remove
the tourniquet first

23:04.150 --> 23:06.018
before you withdraw the needle.

23:06.052 --> 23:08.387
Apply pressure
to slow the bleed.

23:08.421 --> 23:11.123
All right.

23:11.157 --> 23:12.692
There you go.

23:12.725 --> 23:14.894
Everything is gonna be
perfectly fine now.

23:17.229 --> 23:19.532
Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Whoa, whoa.

23:19.566 --> 23:22.234
Okay.
-Mm-hmm.

23:22.268 --> 23:24.303
Amazing catch, Conrad.

23:24.336 --> 23:26.038
Don't tell me I guessed right.

23:26.072 --> 23:29.275
You ordered a CT with a pancreas
protocol on a 14-year-old.

23:29.308 --> 23:31.644
How in the world did you know?

23:31.678 --> 23:33.245
Uh, the family history
was a red flag.

23:33.279 --> 23:35.948
It was a long shot,
but I had to check.

23:37.283 --> 23:39.486
Jack has pancreatic cancer.

23:45.658 --> 23:48.160
OSDER: I know you may not
feel lucky right now,

23:48.194 --> 23:50.296
but you are.

23:50.329 --> 23:53.432
The accident brought you
into the hospital,

23:53.466 --> 23:56.302
and Dr. Hawkins caught it early.

23:56.335 --> 23:58.437
Am I gonna die?

23:58.471 --> 24:01.340
There is every reason
to believe that surgery will be

24:01.373 --> 24:02.942
a total cure.

24:02.975 --> 24:04.176
If we get him
to Houston tonight,

24:04.210 --> 24:05.778
will MD Anderson
have a room for him?

24:05.812 --> 24:08.681
Okay, please let me know
as soon as possible.

24:08.715 --> 24:12.118
-Thank you.
-Mr. Alderwood.

24:12.151 --> 24:15.287
Randolph Bell, Chief of Surgery,
CEO here at Chastain.

24:15.321 --> 24:18.090
I'm so sorry to hear
about your son's diagnosis.

24:18.124 --> 24:20.026
Now, you should know
that Chastain's cancer wing

24:20.059 --> 24:21.528
-is state of the art...
-No, no. MD Anderson

24:21.561 --> 24:22.829
is a top five cancer center.

24:22.862 --> 24:24.096
Only the best for Jack.

24:24.130 --> 24:25.532
We need to get him there
as soon as possible.

24:25.565 --> 24:28.367
I understand. You know,
we do have a connection

24:28.400 --> 24:29.936
to a helicopter company

24:29.969 --> 24:31.804
that can handle the transfer
to the airport.

24:31.838 --> 24:33.472
They're not cheap.
You might want to check

24:33.506 --> 24:35.642
-with your insurance first.
-No, money is no object.

24:37.677 --> 24:39.145
Well, I'm glad we could help.

24:39.178 --> 24:40.947
OSDER: The next step
is to stage the cancer,

24:40.980 --> 24:43.983
check for metastasis, make sure
Jack's lymph nodes are clear.

24:44.016 --> 24:45.985
Okay?

24:46.018 --> 24:48.988
Thank you.

24:51.357 --> 24:54.293
Baby...

24:54.326 --> 24:57.029
You're gonna be okay, okay?

25:14.446 --> 25:17.116
*

25:38.270 --> 25:40.539
-There's a young girl

25:40.573 --> 25:42.541
running around the hospital.
About 12 or 13.

25:42.575 --> 25:44.010
I caught her stealing
from the drug cart.

25:44.043 --> 25:45.745
I think she's in withdrawal.
She's blonde, pale.

25:45.778 --> 25:47.780
-I'll check Five East.
-Thanks.

25:54.654 --> 25:56.623
Hey.

25:56.656 --> 25:58.090
Check me out.

25:58.124 --> 25:59.425
I got it, I got it.

26:00.960 --> 26:02.729
No, Micah, don't!

26:06.132 --> 26:07.466
No, I'm fine,
I'm fine, I'm fine.

26:07.499 --> 26:08.467
I just twisted it a little bit.

26:08.500 --> 26:09.969
-That's all.
-There's someone in here!

26:10.002 --> 26:12.471
-Mina, hurry!
-MICAH: Go.

26:12.504 --> 26:14.140
Go. I'm fine.

26:14.974 --> 26:16.643
I see legs.

26:16.676 --> 26:19.045
Okay. Careful, careful.

26:19.078 --> 26:21.147
Oh, my gosh.

26:24.450 --> 26:27.654
She's alive.
Let's clear her from the door.

26:27.687 --> 26:29.622
-Call a rapid response team.
-Yeah.

26:30.657 --> 26:31.758
Nic!

26:31.791 --> 26:34.193
She's in here. She's diabetic.

26:37.596 --> 26:39.732
NIC:
Oh, my God.

26:39.766 --> 26:41.133
She was looking for insulin.

26:41.167 --> 26:43.469
-Probably.

26:43.502 --> 26:45.604
She tried injecting herself,
but she was too late.

26:45.638 --> 26:47.406
All right, let's get her
out of here and find a vein.

26:47.439 --> 26:48.507
If we don't get access,
she's gonna code.

26:48.540 --> 26:49.776
Hey. Just got the call.
What do you need?

26:49.809 --> 26:52.011
NIC:
She's dry.

26:52.044 --> 26:54.280
-Yes, but not here. Not sterile.

26:54.313 --> 26:56.115
-Let's get her a room.
-I discharged 5027

26:56.148 --> 26:57.349
earlier this morning.
Should be clean now.

26:57.383 --> 26:58.584
Okay, go to the crash cart
at the end

26:58.617 --> 26:59.618
of the hall.
Get me a central line kit.

26:59.652 --> 27:01.520
And ask a nurse to help you. Go.

27:01.553 --> 27:04.023
-Okay. One, two, three.
-Three.

27:06.125 --> 27:09.528
No, no, no. Here, here, here.
Just take that.

27:09.561 --> 27:11.831
Got it.

27:11.864 --> 27:15.668
-But he said get a nurse.
-I got it.

27:17.303 --> 27:18.671
Pulse is tachy at 130.

27:19.839 --> 27:21.640
Here.

27:21.674 --> 27:23.309
This is a Foley catheter kit.

27:23.342 --> 27:25.044
This is for urine.
I told you to ask a nurse.

27:25.077 --> 27:26.679
NIC: No kit, no choice.
We have to do an EJ.

27:26.713 --> 27:28.447
All right. I'm gonna crank
the bed down so she's headfirst.

27:28.480 --> 27:30.983
Prepping for an IO
in case you can't get access.

27:32.151 --> 27:33.853
NIC:
Prepping for an EJ.

27:37.589 --> 27:38.657
Swab, please.

27:44.764 --> 27:46.465
We're in.

27:46.498 --> 27:48.034
All right, let's hang fluids.
Two liters to start.

27:48.067 --> 27:51.370
-Wait. Let me get
the blood first.
-Okay.

27:59.946 --> 28:03.215
NIC: Glucose, 583.
Bicarb, undetectable.

28:03.249 --> 28:04.650
PH, 6.8. She's DKA.

28:04.683 --> 28:05.885
A little longer in a coma,

28:05.918 --> 28:07.186
-she would have died.
-Let's get her to the ICU.

28:07.219 --> 28:08.855
She still might.

28:15.694 --> 28:18.931
You're Dr. AJ Austin.
I'd recognize you anywhere.

28:18.965 --> 28:20.767
I'm sure you have a job to do,

28:20.800 --> 28:23.702
but salespeople should not be
roaming the halls of Chastain.

28:23.736 --> 28:26.839
The AJ Austin who did an
ascending aortic reconstruction

28:26.873 --> 28:28.941
with a coronary artery
reimplantation

28:28.975 --> 28:30.743
in two hours, skin to skin.

28:30.777 --> 28:32.344
I might be that guy.

28:32.378 --> 28:34.513
Okay, I am that guy,
but I'm still not buying.

28:34.546 --> 28:37.183
No agenda, I swear.
I'm just a fangirl.

28:37.216 --> 28:39.852
Dr. Benedict at Atlanta General
told me all about you.

28:39.886 --> 28:41.720
Said you were the best student
he ever had.

28:41.754 --> 28:43.055
You know Abe?

28:43.089 --> 28:44.556
Quovadis has a fantastic,

28:44.590 --> 28:46.859
new left atrial appendage
occlusion device.

28:46.893 --> 28:49.461
Dr. Benedict has been
putting it in for the past year.

28:49.495 --> 28:52.531
I can show it to you
if you're interested.

28:52.564 --> 28:55.067
All right.
You got about five minutes.

28:55.101 --> 28:56.803
-Lead the way.
-Great.

29:01.340 --> 29:03.709
SECRETARY: I have your lawyer,
Mr. McCrary, line two.

29:03.742 --> 29:05.778
All right.
This is a private call.

29:05.812 --> 29:07.746
There's no need to take notes.

29:08.781 --> 29:10.549
Yeah?

29:10.582 --> 29:13.719
Turns out
your hooker cop was wired.

29:13.752 --> 29:16.255
We aren't gonna get
a not guilty verdict.

29:16.288 --> 29:18.157
The arraignment's
first thing in the morning.

29:18.190 --> 29:20.459
We'll try to plea bargain.

29:20.492 --> 29:22.561
Look reasonable and contrite.

29:22.594 --> 29:24.931
Judges want to see a defendant
who knows he's made a mistake

29:24.964 --> 29:26.632
and won't make another.

29:37.143 --> 29:38.644
MINA:
Micah?

29:38.677 --> 29:41.347
Are you okay? I...

29:41.380 --> 29:43.615
I'm sorry I had to leave you
like that.

29:43.649 --> 29:45.351
I'm fine.

29:45.384 --> 29:47.686
I don't want to be
a distraction.

29:47.719 --> 29:49.121
You're a doctor.

29:49.155 --> 29:50.789
I understand
you have important things to do.

29:50.823 --> 29:53.692
You are important.

29:55.727 --> 29:57.663
This isn't working.

29:57.696 --> 30:00.132
I see what's going on.

30:00.166 --> 30:01.968
So do you.

30:02.001 --> 30:04.971
We may be a thing,
but we're a brand-new thing.

30:05.004 --> 30:08.107
And this is not
what you signed up for.

30:08.140 --> 30:10.542
I can't be a burden.

30:11.543 --> 30:12.979
WOMAN :
Dr. Okafor,

30:13.012 --> 30:14.380
please report to OR One.

30:14.413 --> 30:16.048
Dr. Okafor,
please report to OR One.

30:16.082 --> 30:17.683
I must go now.

30:17.716 --> 30:20.719
But I am not agreeing with you.

30:20.752 --> 30:24.891
No big decisions
until we make one together.

30:44.776 --> 30:47.646
Conrad.
Jack's lymph nodes look clear.

30:47.679 --> 30:50.149
The cancer is most likely
localized to the pancreas.

30:50.182 --> 30:52.084
-Okay, that's good news.
-But the trauma.

30:52.118 --> 30:54.086
The accident,
it looks like it started a bleed

30:54.120 --> 30:56.088
on the tumor itself. Right here.

30:56.122 --> 30:57.924
It was too small
to pick up before,

30:57.957 --> 30:59.758
but there it is.

31:08.400 --> 31:09.868
Stop!

31:10.937 --> 31:12.004
He can't fly.

31:12.038 --> 31:13.105
The helicopter's waiting.

31:13.139 --> 31:14.873
His tumor is bleeding
into his abdomen.

31:14.907 --> 31:17.243
He needs to have
the surgery now.

31:17.276 --> 31:19.511
You put him on that helicopter,

31:19.545 --> 31:21.080
he dies
before he gets to Houston.

31:24.216 --> 31:26.385
NOLAN: Okay, patient's name
is Jack Alderwood.

31:26.418 --> 31:27.786
JESSICA:
Confirmed.

31:27.819 --> 31:29.455
NOLAN: Procedure
is partial pancreatectomy.

31:29.488 --> 31:31.390
Surgeon is Dr. Albert Nolan.

31:31.423 --> 31:33.859
-Signed and in the chart.

31:33.892 --> 31:35.761
All right.

31:35.794 --> 31:37.296
Partial pancreatectomy.

31:37.329 --> 31:39.398
Isn't that right up your alley?

31:39.431 --> 31:41.400
BELL: I've done over 500
of these in my career.

31:41.433 --> 31:42.701
More than anyone else
in Atlanta.

31:42.734 --> 31:44.136
Maybe more than anyone
in the country.

31:44.170 --> 31:46.939
Yeah, well,
CEO is an important job, too.

31:46.973 --> 31:48.507
At least, I think it is.

31:49.575 --> 31:51.944
It is.

31:52.945 --> 31:55.247
I still miss the OR.

31:55.281 --> 31:57.283
Just keep me updated
on how this goes.

31:57.316 --> 31:58.917
I'm here if they need me.

31:58.951 --> 32:00.953
Yeah, you got it, boss.

32:08.760 --> 32:12.231
Where are your med students?

32:12.264 --> 32:14.500
I sent them home.

32:14.533 --> 32:16.768
I'm done babysitting.

32:16.802 --> 32:18.370
Thank you, Carol.

32:20.439 --> 32:22.975
That's too bad, Conrad. Oops.

32:23.009 --> 32:25.511
-I mean, Devon.
-I'm not Conrad.

32:25.544 --> 32:27.346
And they're sure not me.

32:27.379 --> 32:30.449
That gunner nearly killed Abby.

32:30.482 --> 32:32.818
Didn't your first patient
end up brain

32:34.853 --> 32:36.788
The kid who screwed up
is still here.

32:36.822 --> 32:39.458
He's in the ICU
watching them work on Abby.

32:39.491 --> 32:41.460
Thought you should know.

32:47.633 --> 32:49.768
NIC:
Hang in there, sweetie.

32:49.801 --> 32:51.670
NURSE:
O2 sats dropping.

32:53.639 --> 32:55.541
She's in respiratory failure.

32:55.574 --> 32:57.009
DOCTOR:
Uh, we need to intubate.

32:57.043 --> 32:58.110
Get the kit.

33:10.489 --> 33:12.991
They're putting her on a vent.
She may never recover.

33:15.194 --> 33:18.097
We all make mistakes.

33:19.998 --> 33:22.868
I've made plenty.

33:22.901 --> 33:26.172
What matters is that
you learn from them.

33:30.609 --> 33:32.244
Poor thing. We got her name,
Abby Arlen,

33:32.278 --> 33:33.645
but we still can't find
her parents.

33:33.679 --> 33:36.115
-I'll go find them.
-Good. Go.

33:53.365 --> 33:54.833
NOLAN:
Okay.

33:54.866 --> 33:56.535
Pancreas is fully exposed.

33:56.568 --> 33:59.271
Prepare a specimen cup

33:59.305 --> 34:01.940
for tissue sample.

34:01.973 --> 34:04.943
AUSTIN: They're doing
a resection of the pancreas,

34:04.976 --> 34:06.712
which is a bitch.

34:06.745 --> 34:08.414
The organ is like Jell-O.

34:08.447 --> 34:11.083
Soft, warm Jell-O.

34:11.117 --> 34:14.953
You cut it wrong, the whole
thing falls apart.

34:14.986 --> 34:18.857
You got to cut out that tumor,
leave yourself margins,

34:18.890 --> 34:21.227
keep the tumor cold
when you walk it--

34:21.260 --> 34:24.863
speed walk it, double-time--
to pathology...

34:24.896 --> 34:28.567
where the pathologist
runs a stain,

34:28.600 --> 34:30.902
puts the specimen under
a microscope,

34:30.936 --> 34:35.107
and looks for those nasty
little cancerous mites.

34:35.141 --> 34:38.110
But you got to do it fast;
time is of the essence.

34:38.144 --> 34:40.078
Our boy is still on the table.

34:46.585 --> 34:48.120
Uh, margins not clear.

34:48.154 --> 34:49.621
Pathologist says to keep going.

34:49.655 --> 34:51.823
It means they didn't get
all the cancer.

34:51.857 --> 34:53.759
They have to take another slice
of the pancreas,

34:53.792 --> 34:55.761
and start the whole process
all over again.

35:13.445 --> 35:15.481
Margins still not clear.

35:34.200 --> 35:36.335
Margins still not clear.

35:51.217 --> 35:53.151
Margins still not clear.

35:58.424 --> 35:59.891
What's going on?

35:59.925 --> 36:02.361
There's hardly
any pancreas left.

36:02.394 --> 36:04.162
They'll have to remove
the entire organ.

36:04.196 --> 36:06.064
AUSTIN: Worse still.
They have to resect parts

36:06.097 --> 36:08.234
of the gallbladder, the small
intestine and the bile duct.

36:08.267 --> 36:09.868
It's a Whipple procedure.

36:09.901 --> 36:12.804
Even I've only done a handful
of Whipples in my life.

36:12.838 --> 36:14.506
Dr. Nolan cannot handle this.

36:14.540 --> 36:17.276
You know who
has to do this, right?

36:21.513 --> 36:24.383
BELL: Oh, the prince walks into
my office without even knocking.

36:24.416 --> 36:25.884
Let's not make this harder
than it needs to be.

36:25.917 --> 36:28.019
I'll make it as hard as I want
to every single time we meet.

36:28.053 --> 36:29.488
I don't care who your father is.

36:29.521 --> 36:31.990
We have an emergency
in OR One. The Alderwood boy.

36:32.023 --> 36:34.025
Pancreatic margins
keep coming back cancerous.

36:34.059 --> 36:35.527
He needs a Whipple procedure.

36:37.229 --> 36:39.030
Back in the day,

36:39.064 --> 36:42.334
you were the unsurpassed master
of the Whipple, but we both know

36:42.368 --> 36:45.337
an appendectomy patient died
in your OR.

36:45.371 --> 36:48.206
Your complication rates
are through the roof.

36:48.240 --> 36:52.244
Can you do this procedure
safely?

36:52.278 --> 36:55.747
I can do it flawlessly,
and it's not your call.

37:24.276 --> 37:25.777
Right angle,
Cooley scissors to me.

37:36.154 --> 37:38.490
Team HODAD.

37:49.034 --> 37:52.304
The surgery was more radical
than we'd hoped, but...

37:52.338 --> 37:53.905
it went off beautifully.

37:53.939 --> 37:56.074
Thank you, Dr. Bell.
And thank you, too, Dr. Hawkins.

37:56.107 --> 37:57.809
CONRAD:
Ah. The most important thing

37:57.843 --> 37:59.277
is that Jack is likely
cancer-free.

37:59.311 --> 38:01.813
And I'll roller dance again,
right?

38:01.847 --> 38:03.281
Absolutely.

38:03.315 --> 38:05.517
Jack, unfortunately,

38:05.551 --> 38:07.118
due to the nature
of your surgery,

38:07.152 --> 38:09.120
you will be a diabetic for
the rest of your life, but...

38:09.154 --> 38:11.089
Maybe not the rest of your life.

38:11.122 --> 38:13.492
Scientists are working on
growing organs in the lab.

38:13.525 --> 38:14.926
Some day, we may get you
a new pancreas.

38:14.960 --> 38:16.995
Okay, and who are you?

38:17.028 --> 38:19.130
Ms. Booth works for
Quovadis Labs.

38:19.164 --> 38:20.832
It's a cutting-edge
medical device company.

38:20.866 --> 38:22.634
JULIAN: I'd like to show you
our new insulin pump.

38:22.668 --> 38:26.037
The drug is delivered
continuously over 24 hours,

38:26.071 --> 38:27.439
and that keeps your blood
glucose levels in range,

38:27.473 --> 38:28.540
even overnight.

38:28.574 --> 38:29.808
How much is it?

38:29.841 --> 38:31.343
JULIAN:
Around ten grand.

38:34.079 --> 38:35.514
We'll take it.

38:35.547 --> 38:37.383
Great.

38:57.703 --> 39:00.338
Is that our new
uninsured patient?

39:00.372 --> 39:05.010
I hear she could end up
costing Chastain a fortune.

39:07.579 --> 39:09.581
That's one way to look at it.

39:09.615 --> 39:13.385
Or you could see
a 13-year-old girl,

39:13.419 --> 39:15.387
who's fighting for her life.

39:15.421 --> 39:17.889
Her name is Abby.

39:17.923 --> 39:19.324
According to her mom,

39:19.357 --> 39:24.229
she loves astronomy and Beyoncé.

39:24.262 --> 39:26.665
She's a straight A student,

39:26.698 --> 39:29.334
and got diabetes
when she was ten.

39:29.367 --> 39:31.870
Her mom works two jobs

39:31.903 --> 39:35.173
but still can't afford
the medicine.

39:35.206 --> 39:38.544
It's over $2,000 a month.

39:38.577 --> 39:41.847
So Abby didn't want
her mom to know

39:41.880 --> 39:45.083
that she needed more insulin.

39:45.116 --> 39:48.787
Started rationing her doses
and ended up here.

39:48.820 --> 39:51.022
She gonna make it?

39:51.056 --> 39:54.626
Maybe.

39:56.127 --> 39:59.330
Is there any way this could have
been prevented?

40:02.400 --> 40:04.369
Technically, the
hospital's a non-profit.

40:04.402 --> 40:06.204
In order to keep
our tax-exempt status,

40:06.237 --> 40:08.106
we're supposed to have programs
that benefit the community.

40:08.139 --> 40:09.708
-Nothing.

40:09.741 --> 40:11.477
Not true. We have health fairs
and flu clinics.

40:11.510 --> 40:13.144
-All kinds of...
-Window dressing.

40:13.178 --> 40:14.746
CONRAD:
The price of insulin has gone

40:14.780 --> 40:17.483
from $21 a vial to $275,

40:17.516 --> 40:19.084
and the drug hasn't changed
one bit.

40:19.117 --> 40:21.086
That's a 1,200% increase,

40:21.119 --> 40:22.821
and it's destroying
people's lives.

40:22.854 --> 40:24.255
Mina and I have an idea.

40:24.289 --> 40:25.791
Let's hear it.

40:25.824 --> 40:27.659
What about an outpatient clinic
for the uninsured,

40:27.693 --> 40:29.427
with community outreach.

40:29.461 --> 40:31.663
I used to volunteer for one run
by Partners in Health in Boston.

40:31.697 --> 40:33.465
We'd love to start something
like that here.

40:33.499 --> 40:35.166
It could have helped Abby;
we missed that chance.

40:35.200 --> 40:36.768
We can't miss chances
like that again.

40:36.802 --> 40:37.803
With what funding?

40:37.836 --> 40:39.838
How much would this cost,

40:39.871 --> 40:42.007
and how much would it save?

40:42.040 --> 40:44.142
I need to see data before
making a commitment.

40:44.175 --> 40:47.178
Is that a polite way
of saying no?

40:47.212 --> 40:48.580
I told you we need balance.

40:48.614 --> 40:53.018
Patient safety
and financial stability.

40:53.051 --> 40:54.452
So get us numbers,
we'll have a look at it,

40:54.486 --> 40:56.655
maybe bring it up at
the next board meeting.

40:58.724 --> 41:00.792
Okay.

41:09.701 --> 41:11.336
I can't say that was a win.

41:11.369 --> 41:13.371
It wasn't a no, either.
Your father left us an opening.

41:13.404 --> 41:15.607
Yeah, I'll start putting
together the numbers.

41:15.641 --> 41:17.943
Okay. Hey.

41:17.976 --> 41:20.145
Hey.

41:20.178 --> 41:22.180
Maybe it's a good thing
that he's here.

41:22.213 --> 41:24.983
Maybe things will be different.

41:37.328 --> 41:38.530
I'm still giving you an out.

41:38.564 --> 41:40.165
And I'm not taking it.

41:40.198 --> 41:43.068
You'll go to rehab,
and you'll get better.

41:43.101 --> 41:45.503
No big decision until then.

41:45.537 --> 41:47.338
You sure you want to
wait for me?

42:00.919 --> 42:02.921
*

42:33.051 --> 42:35.053
*

42:42.594 --> 42:46.431
You told me the judge would show
mercy for a first offense.

42:46.464 --> 42:47.766
Luck of the draw.

42:47.799 --> 42:49.300
We caught a hard-ass.

42:49.334 --> 42:52.103
And this will be reported
to the state medical board?

42:52.137 --> 42:53.571
Not exactly.

42:53.605 --> 42:55.974
By law, you now have to
self-report

42:56.007 --> 42:58.109
your conviction
for solicitation.

42:58.143 --> 43:00.245
Here are the forms.

43:00.278 --> 43:04.249
You're the one who must report
this to the state medical board.

43:06.517 --> 43:08.319
You mean, if I don't file
the forms,

43:08.353 --> 43:10.388
they'll never know
I was arrested?

43:10.421 --> 43:12.457
The only way anyone
would find out

43:12.490 --> 43:14.092
is if they went to
the police department

43:14.125 --> 43:16.227
and requested a copy
of your criminal record.

43:16.261 --> 43:18.964
Who is ever gonna think of that?

43:21.532 --> 43:23.201
I'm a doctor.

44:11.082 --> 44:13.051
Captioned by
Media Access Group at WGBH

44:15.186 --> 44:16.955
You survived your shift
with The Resident.

44:16.988 --> 44:19.524
Now here are a few more shows
to check out from Fox.

44:22.093 --> 44:23.328
Buckle up, buttercup.

44:25.663 --> 44:27.999
It's real, and it pulls
people together.

44:28.033 --> 44:31.569
-* We're breaking waves
shooting star *

44:31.602 --> 44:35.173
* We live for glory
not forever *

44:35.206 --> 44:36.207
MAN: Touchdown!

44:36.241 --> 44:39.811
* Reach out *

44:39.845 --> 44:43.414
* Make this right here
right now *

44:43.448 --> 44:46.384
* Stand up *

44:47.252 --> 44:49.020
* Here right now *

44:49.054 --> 44:51.022
That sounds like fun.
