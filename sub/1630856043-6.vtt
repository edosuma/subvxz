-How long it take for you

00:19.352 --> 00:20.562
It shouldn't even matter.

00:20.603 --> 00:22.731
Tupac checked his own self

02:33.778 --> 02:35.113
But she never
slapped us before.

02:35.113 --> 02:36.698
Yeah, but this
is bad, though.

02:36.740 --> 02:37.949

She doesn't--

03:18.948 --> 03:20.492
I took them to the Wellspring.

03:21.201 --> 03:23.995
She was doing too much.
Loud in a hotel room.

03:24.037 --> 03:26.998
Back and forth in the lobby,
giggling like a crackhead.

03:26.998 --> 03:29.250
Eventually, they called
the po-pos.

03:29.626 --> 03:31.169
Was Dante at the hotel?

03:31.211 --> 03:33.088
I don't know what dick
she was suckin'.

03:33.505 --> 03:36.508
Dante is the general manager
at Wellspring.

03:36.549 --> 03:39.844
You were supposed
to pay him to
take care of it.

03:39.886 --> 03:41.012
Well, I ain't know that.

03:41.805 --> 03:42.847
But I told you that.

03:44.349 --> 03:46.601
What? I did.
I told her she was
supposed to pay him,

03:46.643 --> 03:48.436
but she never listens
to us, does she?

03:49.020 --> 03:50.063
Tell her, Deja.

03:50.522 --> 03:51.981
I know where you sleep, hoe.

03:51.981 --> 03:54.025
Calling us dusty.
Who dusty now?

03:54.067 --> 03:55.944
-Shut your tired ass up!
-Dusty Deja!

That's your new name.

03:57.362 --> 03:59.614
-Musty-ass--
-Shut the fuck up!

04:01.700 --> 04:04.285
This the shit
I be talkin' 'bout!

04:04.327 --> 04:05.662
You can't just take them
to any hotel

04:05.704 --> 04:06.955
and do what
the fuck you want.

04:07.914 --> 04:09.791
Now my shit hot
'cause of you.

04:12.043 --> 04:13.211

04:13.878 --> 04:17.214

till it die down

04:17.257 --> 04:18.716

04:20.552 --> 04:22.762
For now, we'll just keep
doing work on Biscayne.

(Jazmin clears throat)

04:31.021 --> 04:32.063
What?

04:32.105 --> 04:34.566
Um, Bugs pushed us
off of Biscayne.

04:34.607 --> 04:36.192
He said the only girls
working those blocks

04:36.234 --> 04:37.569
are the girls
working for him.

04:41.573 --> 04:43.074
I'll take care of it.

04:49.748 --> 04:50.790

04:51.916 --> 04:54.711
Oh, no he didn't.
Miss Peaches.

04:54.753 --> 04:57.005
Male Neighbor (muffled):

a woman who worked out.

05:03.762 --> 05:06.348

05:14.105 --> 05:15.523
What Francois say?

05:16.608 --> 05:18.234
Francois
hasn't heard anything.

05:18.276 --> 05:19.944
It's just all paused up
right now.

05:21.780 --> 05:23.239
But we had a good meeting.

05:23.782 --> 05:25.408
I mean, the dude
at Def Jam seemed like

05:25.450 --> 05:26.576
he wanted to work
with us.

05:27.243 --> 05:29.120
They're execs,
they say all types of shit.

05:29.120 --> 05:31.456

05:40.298 --> 05:41.299

05:42.801 --> 05:44.969
We were so close, though.

05:47.472 --> 05:48.723

this shit happened.

-Damn.
-Shawna: I don't know.

05:54.521 --> 05:56.356
I didn't,
I didn't see it coming.

05:57.982 --> 05:59.984
I knew something was wrong
with him, but...

06:02.612 --> 06:04.155
I could have done
something. Like--

06:04.155 --> 06:05.740
Mia:
Girl, no.

06:05.782 --> 06:07.909
Shawna:
It happened so fast.

06:08.326 --> 06:09.828
I mean,
it's not your fault.

06:10.995 --> 06:12.497

from Chastity?

06:17.669 --> 06:19.504
I mean, she said
she was gonna hit us up

19:13.278 --> 19:14.404
You remember that
white family

19:14.446 --> 19:16.072
that kept trying to blame me
for the weather?

19:16.114 --> 19:18.867

to restaurants in the hood?

19:22.620 --> 19:24.873
Even though you was trying
to be mean to me and shit.

19:24.914 --> 19:26.249
I wasn't mean to you.

19:26.791 --> 19:28.960
-Mm.
-No, I had a boyfriend.

19:29.461 --> 19:31.713
And you kept trying
to flirt with me,

19:31.755 --> 19:33.757
throwing dick around
all willy-nilly.

You were the highlight

19:44.476 --> 19:45.894

Oh, yeah?

19:53.318 --> 19:54.361
Shawna:
Yeah.

19:57.364 --> 19:59.741
You're the only person
I can be myself with.

20:03.370 --> 20:06.164
