00:06.072 --> 00:10.282
They say breakfast
is the most important meal of the day...

00:12.312 --> 00:16.419
...but ever since Noah's surrogate, a.k.a.
my dad's pregnant girlfriend, moved in...

00:21.721 --> 00:23.894
...it was also the most awkward.

00:25.525 --> 00:26.731
Pregnancy cravings?

00:26.893 --> 00:28.395
No. I eat this every day.

00:28.561 --> 00:31.508
It's a good source of energy
because it's live.

00:31.664 --> 00:32.870
What's live?

00:33.033 --> 00:35.479
My chia seed porridge, silly.

00:39.539 --> 00:41.246
- Mm, you got a little chia there.
- Mm.

00:42.075 --> 00:44.248
You know what never gets
stuck in your teeth?

00:44.411 --> 00:45.446
White icing.

00:45.612 --> 00:47.216
- Good morning.
- Morning.

00:48.915 --> 00:51.088
Is it school picture day?

00:51.251 --> 00:53.527
What? Heh, that's very funny.

00:53.686 --> 00:56.394
- I don't get it.
- George usually comes to breakfast in...

00:56.556 --> 00:58.729
...old sweatpants and a nasal strip.

00:58.892 --> 01:00.371
Thank you, Tessa.

01:00.527 --> 01:01.938
I warmed up your icing.

01:02.095 --> 01:03.665
Oh, thank you. I am starving.

01:03.830 --> 01:05.537
"No. Don't do it, George.

01:05.698 --> 01:07.974
I'm so much healthier and yummier.

01:08.134 --> 01:10.444
Try me. I'm on the stove."

01:12.105 --> 01:15.484
Don't look at me.
It's the chia seed talking.

01:16.342 --> 01:18.151
Did I miss something? Heh.

01:18.311 --> 01:20.086
Eden's food is alive.

01:20.246 --> 01:21.657
Her comic timing...

01:21.848 --> 01:24.124
- Okay. Hey, you cooked this, huh?
- Mm-hm.

01:24.284 --> 01:25.627
Okay. That's nice.

01:25.852 --> 01:28.731
- That's, uh, very rich and earthy, isn't it?
- George.

01:28.888 --> 01:30.595
I went to all this trouble.

01:30.790 --> 01:33.430
Oh, well, okay, wait a minute.

01:33.960 --> 01:36.236
Best of both worlds.

01:36.396 --> 01:39.275
"Help! I'm drowning in a pool of fructose.

01:40.633 --> 01:43.011
I can't feel my own goodness."

01:43.236 --> 01:45.739
How long are you in town for?

01:48.074 --> 01:50.076
So...

01:50.310 --> 01:52.847
- ...how long is she in town for?
- It's a fair question.

01:53.012 --> 01:55.925
Answer? I wanna mark it down
on my calendar with a smiley face.

01:56.082 --> 01:57.459
Okay, well.

01:57.617 --> 02:00.029
Late June, she should deliver.
So early July...

02:00.186 --> 02:03.292
...she should be... Could be leaving.

02:03.456 --> 02:06.027
Might be the middle of August.
I'm not exactly sure.

02:06.192 --> 02:09.002
But whether it's many,
many weeks more...

02:09.162 --> 02:11.665
...or only three weeks more,
or six months...

02:11.831 --> 02:15.938
...from when she moved in,
or a year from when she first conceived...

02:16.102 --> 02:19.208
- ...or three months from mid-June.
- You haven't discussed it yet.

02:19.405 --> 02:21.817
No, we haven't talked about that.

02:21.975 --> 02:25.388
Have you discussed how long she spends
in the bathroom every morning...

02:25.545 --> 02:27.024
...when I need to get ready?

02:27.180 --> 02:29.182
I know it's annoying having
someone in your space...

02:29.349 --> 02:32.387
...telling you what to eat, how to live
and to not use the Internet.

02:32.552 --> 02:34.532
- What?
- Doesn't want us to use the Internet.

02:34.687 --> 02:37.964
- Because...
- Wireless signal causes fetal sterility.

02:38.124 --> 02:40.365
So she's worried about the baby
having babies?

02:40.527 --> 02:42.006
It would seem so, yeah.

02:42.162 --> 02:45.735
But, hey, look, I know it's a lot
to put up with, but it's not forever.

02:45.932 --> 02:46.967
Right.

02:47.133 --> 02:49.943
Just three months...

02:50.103 --> 02:53.641
...or many, many weeks from the
midsummer date you refuse to commit to.

02:53.806 --> 02:55.080
Right.

02:57.000 --> 03:03.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:05.952 --> 03:08.990
All right. Another great scheduled
visitation with my unborn baby.

03:10.423 --> 03:11.561
See you next visit.

03:11.724 --> 03:13.897
- Bells on.
- And, no, you don't have to have...

03:14.060 --> 03:18.975
- ...your office call to confirm. I'll be here.
- Good stuff. That's good, stuff.

03:22.068 --> 03:24.947
- You are screwed.
- Beg pardon?

03:25.104 --> 03:27.914
She's got that baby
wrapped around her uterus.

03:28.074 --> 03:31.578
She's got the uterus wrapped around
the baby. It's how it's supposed to be.

03:31.744 --> 03:33.382
You're missing the point, dumb-dumb.

03:33.546 --> 03:37.084
She's in that baby's head all day,
every day.

03:37.917 --> 03:39.089
She's got his ear.

03:39.252 --> 03:44.099
And the male voice he hears the most
belongs to George.

03:44.257 --> 03:46.134
George.

03:46.292 --> 03:50.536
He swears he only let Eden move in
to keep her from going back to Montana...

03:50.697 --> 03:54.702
...but a small part of me wonders
if it wasn't self-motivated.

03:55.201 --> 03:56.236
A big part.

03:56.402 --> 03:59.713
Almost all of me. There is not one
part of me that doesn't feel that!

03:59.872 --> 04:02.944
Then keep your baby close and
the people who carry your baby closer.

04:03.109 --> 04:06.784
If I were you, I would double the length
of those scheduled visits.

04:06.946 --> 04:09.654
Let that baby know who his daddy is.

04:09.816 --> 04:11.420
Oh, he'll know who his daddy is.

04:11.584 --> 04:13.530
- Will he?
- Oh, yeah. He'll know.

04:13.686 --> 04:14.630
- Who's his daddy?
- I am.

04:14.787 --> 04:16.130
- Who's his daddy?
- I'm his daddy!

04:16.289 --> 04:17.358
- Who's his daddy?
- I'm his daddy!

04:17.523 --> 04:18.762
- Who's his daddy?
- I'm his daddy!

04:18.925 --> 04:20.096
- Who's his daddy?
- Who's your daddy?

04:20.260 --> 04:23.036
You've never met. He lives in Oregon!

04:34.107 --> 04:36.747
Dalia, I've been looking
for my keys for 20 minutes...

04:36.909 --> 04:40.083
...and again they were in
the pouch of Penuche, your kangaroo.

04:40.246 --> 04:41.816
He likes shiny things.

04:41.981 --> 04:44.359
I'm well aware. Your kangaroo is a klepto.

04:44.550 --> 04:47.190
And yesterday
he kicked Carmen in the gut.

04:47.353 --> 04:48.388
She provoked him.

04:49.989 --> 04:51.491
Dalia, face it.

04:51.658 --> 04:55.299
Kangaroos weren't meant to live
in spacious Mediterranean revivals.

04:55.461 --> 04:57.600
- So we'll move.
- We are not moving.

04:57.764 --> 05:00.973
Kangaroo Jack is the one who's moving,
to the guesthouse.

05:01.134 --> 05:03.011
But Penuche isn't a guest, he's family.

05:03.169 --> 05:07.174
Can't we just lock up the silver like we do
when the service people are here...

05:07.340 --> 05:09.616
...and make Carmen wear
a medieval suit of armor?

05:12.145 --> 05:16.719
Well, heh, it would be funny to make Carmen
wear a medieval suit of armor.

05:16.883 --> 05:18.453
But, no. No, we can't.

05:20.420 --> 05:22.195
Oh, Lord.

05:22.355 --> 05:24.665
I suspect that's the china cabinet.

05:27.060 --> 05:28.562
Oh, he learned how to open doors!

05:28.728 --> 05:31.868
This is it, Dalia.
This is how the monkeys rose.

05:32.231 --> 05:34.233
It's nice to have someone cooking for us.

05:34.400 --> 05:36.676
Are you kidding, George? It smells like...

05:36.836 --> 05:40.181
Sugarcoated yum-yum. Sweet
sugar yum-yum. Our tummies are growling.

05:40.340 --> 05:42.115
- Heh.
- Nice save, George.

05:42.275 --> 05:44.016
Ta-da!

05:44.177 --> 05:46.657
Mm.
- Introducing wheat meat.

05:46.813 --> 05:50.420
I was worried the extra corn would
make the loaf too loose, but it didn't.

05:51.684 --> 05:54.927
- Yep. She's a firm one.
- Tessa. Come on, let's dig in.

05:55.121 --> 05:56.998
The wheat meat loaf won't eat itself.

05:57.156 --> 05:59.693
- I don't blame it.
- So how was school today?

05:59.859 --> 06:03.864
They made texting a language,
so I can officially drop Spanish.

06:04.030 --> 06:07.842
Okay, Tessa, now, listen to me.
I hated French. I mean, hated it.

06:08.000 --> 06:10.606
But I stuck with it and now?
If we were in Paris...

06:10.770 --> 06:13.114
...and I had a sore throat,
I could tell someone.

06:13.272 --> 06:15.377
- So?
- Tessa, your dad is right.

06:15.541 --> 06:17.020
Oliver Wendell Holmes said:

06:17.210 --> 06:20.419
"Language is the blood
of the soul into which...

06:20.580 --> 06:24.960
- ...thoughts run and out of which they grow."
- "Thoughts run and out of which they grow."

06:25.151 --> 06:30.430
- So...
- That doesn't resonate with me.

06:30.590 --> 06:34.265
Let's take a vote. Whoever thinks
Tessa should continue to feed her soul...

06:34.427 --> 06:37.271
...with the language blood,
raise your hand.

06:37.430 --> 06:40.001
- Oh.
- Is she even registered to vote here?

06:40.166 --> 06:41.201
She is now.

06:45.104 --> 06:47.516
The food sucks. There's no Wi-Fi...

06:47.673 --> 06:51.280
...and the two of them are ganging up on me.
I have to get out of this house.

06:51.444 --> 06:53.321
I'm counting the days
until macramé camp.

06:53.479 --> 06:57.291
I can't stand being under the same roof
with the woman formerly known as "Mother."

06:57.450 --> 06:59.657
- Still harping on the adoption stuff, huh?
- Yeah.

06:59.819 --> 07:03.892
As soon as I get my DNA results back, I can
prove once and for all that I am not a Shay.

07:04.056 --> 07:06.662
Well, I have to figure
out an exit strategy...

07:06.826 --> 07:09.306
...or you'll have to box-weave me
a noose this summer.

07:09.462 --> 07:11.806
Oh, they don't let us do that any more.

07:11.964 --> 07:15.173
But what if you came
to macramé camp with me?

07:15.334 --> 07:19.111
I mean, I, for one, can't wait
to weave my troubles behind me.

07:19.272 --> 07:21.218
Just picture it, Tess.

07:22.208 --> 07:23.846
Cool wind in your hair...

07:24.343 --> 07:27.552
...the feeling of bristly yarn
against your fingertips.

07:27.713 --> 07:32.662
Sound of the interstate
muted by a thin line of balding trees.

07:38.658 --> 07:41.502
Don't know if macramé camp is for me.
I'm more a city girl.

07:41.661 --> 07:44.073
Camp in New York?
The cost of thread alone.

07:44.230 --> 07:46.506
What about an internship?
Like, at a newspaper.

07:46.666 --> 07:48.668
I have experience
on The Chatswin Chatterer.

07:48.835 --> 07:50.075
I could live in Manhattan.

07:50.236 --> 07:53.046
- Think your dad would allow that?
- I don't know, Lisa.

07:53.206 --> 07:55.686
It's complicated. Something's gotta give.

07:55.842 --> 07:59.756
The thing I love most about her movies
is how sexually active the older women are.

08:01.647 --> 08:03.718
You guys were talking
Nancy Meyers, right?

08:03.883 --> 08:07.160
No one who still gets their period
is ever talking about Nancy Meyers.

08:08.421 --> 08:11.595
- We were talking about camp.
- Sports camp? Can't wait.

08:11.757 --> 08:13.794
Sports camp?
We're going to macramé camp.

08:13.960 --> 08:17.100
- I'm not going to macramé camp.
- We're spending the summer together.

08:17.263 --> 08:21.040
Doesn't mean I'm going to macramé camp.
So unless you'll box-weave me a noose...

08:21.200 --> 08:24.409
- They don't do that any more.
- Picture it, Malik.

08:24.570 --> 08:26.049
Cool wind in your hair.

08:26.205 --> 08:27.240
I've gotta go.

08:27.406 --> 08:28.942
The feeling of bristly yarn...

08:32.544 --> 08:35.082
But I had the last laugh.

08:35.248 --> 08:38.889
That summer I grew body hair...

08:39.051 --> 08:41.929
...and after that,
no one called me "Ladypits."

08:42.087 --> 08:47.003
Noah, I can't feel my legs and I have to pee.
You're leaning on my bladder.

08:47.159 --> 08:48.467
So we take a bathroom break.

08:48.661 --> 08:53.701
I'm not completely unreasonable. Empty
out and then we'll travel to junior prom...

08:53.866 --> 08:56.142
...which I almost didn't attend. Ha, ha.

08:58.738 --> 09:01.719
- The theme of my prom was Cats.
- Noah!

09:01.874 --> 09:04.184
Meow, meow, meow...

09:04.343 --> 09:06.289
Enough.

09:06.445 --> 09:08.925
I'm sorry. I just want the baby
to know who I am...

09:09.081 --> 09:12.494
...and to know which cat I dressed up as
to the prom. Rum Tum Tugger.

09:12.685 --> 09:14.824
I'm sorry, Noah, but time is up.

09:14.987 --> 09:18.093
You've been here for three hours
and, frankly, I've had enough.

09:18.257 --> 09:20.567
Okay? Off you go.

09:20.726 --> 09:23.639
"Off you go." Don't talk like that to me
in front of the baby.

09:24.130 --> 09:25.939
Look, I get that you don't like me.

09:26.098 --> 09:29.136
Frankly, I got it a couple of weeks ago
when you moved out.

09:29.302 --> 09:32.681
I moved out because you have no ability
to respect people's boundaries.

09:32.838 --> 09:37.344
You are the one with no respect for me. You
think that I'm going to be a bad father.

09:37.510 --> 09:41.356
But I'll tell you something. If you have
seen me take care of my sports car...

09:41.581 --> 09:44.528
...if you have seen me lint-brush
my cashmere cardigan...

09:44.684 --> 09:46.994
...then you have seen me care
for beautiful things.

09:47.153 --> 09:50.191
And that baby is going to be
my most beautiful thing.

09:50.356 --> 09:52.302
We hope. I mean, you know...

09:52.458 --> 09:55.098
...my mother-in-law, textbook grotesque.

09:56.429 --> 09:58.306
Rest her soul, tsk.

09:58.464 --> 10:00.444
You're a piece of work.

10:02.134 --> 10:06.207
Okay, the only fair way to decide
which camp Melissa attends...

10:06.372 --> 10:09.114
...is for each of you to sample
the other's passion.

10:09.275 --> 10:10.948
Not that passion.

10:11.110 --> 10:14.023
You can sample that passion
on your own time.

10:14.180 --> 10:18.822
If we're good at the other person's passion,
we do have to go to their camp or we don't?

10:18.985 --> 10:21.966
Knot up, Malik, and find your weave.

10:22.321 --> 10:23.891
Sorry if that sounds racist.

10:24.056 --> 10:25.865
So, what should I make, a key ring?

10:26.025 --> 10:27.800
- Yawn.
- A friendship bracelet?

10:27.960 --> 10:29.803
- Overdone.
- How am I supposed to...?

10:29.962 --> 10:31.373
"Beweave" in yourself.

10:31.530 --> 10:32.736
Just beweave.

10:32.898 --> 10:36.004
Oh, yeah. I like this stick.
Makes me feel powerful.

10:36.168 --> 10:37.670
Like a warrior! Aah!

10:39.805 --> 10:40.909
Damn, girl.

10:42.642 --> 10:45.851
Told you we should have
explored our passions outside.

10:46.879 --> 10:49.758
My own escape plan was ready to go.
My ink-jet, however...

10:49.915 --> 10:51.792
Print, you stupid page. Print!

10:53.285 --> 10:54.992
Tessa?

10:55.488 --> 10:57.593
- Did you turn on the wireless router?
- No.

11:00.059 --> 11:05.099
Look, I was just temporarily on the Internet
for an important academic endeavor.

11:05.297 --> 11:07.607
- Village Voice internship?
- That's not mine.

11:09.035 --> 11:11.379
Okay, it's mine. Please don't freak out.

11:11.537 --> 11:14.108
Why not? I love alternative weeklies.

11:14.306 --> 11:16.946
- I'm a huge slut for them.
- You are?

11:17.109 --> 11:20.522
My first internship was on
a sustainable farm in Santa Cruz.

11:20.746 --> 11:23.590
It was my job to pee on the compost.

11:23.749 --> 11:26.059
Someone's got to.

11:26.352 --> 11:27.456
Or do they?

11:27.620 --> 11:30.294
Before me, it was a job that
had only been done by men.

11:30.456 --> 11:32.436
Took some real persistence on my part...

11:32.591 --> 11:36.971
...but I proved the nitrogen in my urine
was just as good as any man's.

11:37.463 --> 11:39.306
Of course, they paid me less.

11:39.465 --> 11:43.470
But you got the job.
So do you have any advice for me?

11:43.636 --> 11:45.980
Apply in person.
Let them put a face to the name.

11:46.138 --> 11:50.553
Okay, that's a good idea. But the major
obstacle here is gonna be George.

11:50.710 --> 11:55.591
- Any time I mention the city, he freaks out.
- Let me talk to him for you.

11:55.748 --> 11:59.321
- You just concentrate on getting the gig.
- Really?

11:59.485 --> 12:00.589
Yeah.

12:01.053 --> 12:04.000
Thanks, Eden. That would be a big help.

12:04.356 --> 12:07.565
And can I ask you one more favor?

12:08.928 --> 12:12.740
- No more chia-seed voices?
- Bingo.

12:14.967 --> 12:19.347
- So, what's up?
- Visit with Noah didn't go very well today.

12:20.139 --> 12:22.881
- I kind of threw him out.
- Well, I'm not surprised.

12:23.042 --> 12:26.990
- This pregnancy has made him nuts.
- He flared his nostrils at me.

12:27.179 --> 12:29.750
He's been throwing
a lot of nostril around these days.

12:29.915 --> 12:31.986
I got an eyeful myself last time I saw him.

12:35.254 --> 12:39.999
- I think I was too blunt with him.
- No. Hey, that's what I like about you.

12:40.192 --> 12:43.639
- You're a straight shooter.
- I'm glad.

12:43.796 --> 12:47.073
Because I shot super straight
with Tessa today when she told me...

12:47.233 --> 12:50.339
...she wanted to apply for an internship
with The Village Voice.

12:52.905 --> 12:53.940
An internship?

12:54.106 --> 12:57.918
I dropped her at the train so she could
walk her application in. She's there now.

12:58.077 --> 12:59.852
- She's there right now?
- Are you mad?

13:00.012 --> 13:01.992
Mad? What makes you think I'm mad?

13:02.148 --> 13:05.095
- You keep answering me in questions.
- Do I?

13:05.251 --> 13:07.959
I'm not mad, I'm confused.

13:08.120 --> 13:10.430
- Confused?
- Yeah. I'm confused as to...

13:10.589 --> 13:12.796
...who in their, heh,
right mind would give...

13:12.958 --> 13:15.802
...someone else's kid permission
to do something like that.

13:15.961 --> 13:18.305
Oh, sorry, I just got an urgent text.

13:18.464 --> 13:24.506
So I'm gonna leave abruptly
and not discuss this any further.

13:37.950 --> 13:41.227
- Knock, knock.
- You're not supposed to be here.

13:41.387 --> 13:44.732
I'm here to drop off my application
for the summer internship.

13:44.890 --> 13:45.960
In person.

13:46.125 --> 13:49.538
Oh, we don't take those in person,
so you gotta go submit that online.

13:49.695 --> 13:54.735
Well, I was gonna submit it online and then
I thought, "This is The Village Voice.

13:54.900 --> 13:57.312
Show some respect, Tessa."

13:57.469 --> 14:00.040
- I'm Tessa.
- Troy. Editorial assistant.

14:00.339 --> 14:03.548
Wow, awesome.
Awesome. That's really awesome.

14:03.709 --> 14:05.313
You went to Humanities?

14:05.477 --> 14:08.754
- Before we moved to the suburbs, yeah.
- You moved to the suburbs?

14:08.914 --> 14:12.487
- Major culture shock.
- That'd make a great piece for Village Voice.

14:12.651 --> 14:15.598
Oh, my God, yeah. Troy, I'd love to.

14:15.788 --> 14:19.429
Well, creative decisions aren't up to me.
But thanks for stopping by.

14:23.529 --> 14:24.940
Troy...

14:25.331 --> 14:29.746
...I know you are a snide,
holier-than-thou urbanite.

14:29.902 --> 14:32.075
That's what I love about you.

14:32.238 --> 14:35.845
And that's what I miss about myself.

14:36.008 --> 14:39.285
I really, really want this internship.

14:39.445 --> 14:41.948
I'll scrape gum off your desk.

14:42.114 --> 14:43.787
I will scrub your toilets.

14:43.949 --> 14:46.930
I will trap rodents
in your sixth-floor walk-up.

14:47.086 --> 14:49.259
I live in an elevator building.

14:49.421 --> 14:51.958
But, um, we'll be in touch.

14:52.591 --> 14:53.626
Okay.

14:54.393 --> 14:57.203
Now just turn and walk away.

14:57.363 --> 15:01.470
If he picks up your application
and looks at it, he's interested.

15:02.134 --> 15:04.375
He's interested.

15:07.039 --> 15:09.610
Ugh, George, thanks for coming right over.

15:09.775 --> 15:12.688
Actually, I was glad to get out of my house
for a minute. What's going on?

15:14.046 --> 15:18.119
That rude 'roo ruined my rooms.
I rue the day I agreed to a kangaroo.

15:18.284 --> 15:21.561
He mangled my Ming
and he wiped his feet on my best Persian.

15:21.720 --> 15:23.097
Gardener, not rug.

15:23.255 --> 15:26.930
You invite someone into your home,
you expect them to treat it with respect.

15:27.092 --> 15:30.164
Exactly, heh.
My roommate situation isn't any better.

15:30.362 --> 15:32.638
Eden totally overstepped her boundaries
with Tessa today.

15:33.999 --> 15:37.173
- Did she beat her?
- Did she...? No. She didn't beat her, Dallas.

15:37.369 --> 15:40.816
She gave her permission to do something
I never would have said yes to.

15:40.973 --> 15:46.787
Oh, so Tessa's not upset, you are.
Trust me, George, that's way better.

15:46.946 --> 15:49.324
An angry teenager is worse
than a locust plague.

15:49.481 --> 15:50.858
Dalia won't come out of her room...

15:51.016 --> 15:53.121
...since I said her pet has to live
in the guesthouse.

15:53.285 --> 15:55.287
Haven't seen her this
upset since she saw...

15:55.454 --> 15:58.025
...the opening weekend numbers
for Madea Goes to Jail.

15:58.190 --> 16:01.194
Well, maybe Dalia's emotional
about having her pet sent away...

16:01.393 --> 16:05.034
...because she recently lost something else
that was important to her.

16:05.197 --> 16:07.803
Oh, her online access to Box Office Mojo?

16:07.967 --> 16:11.380
I had to, George.
She's better off ignorant like her dad.

16:11.537 --> 16:15.815
- Oh, you meant her dad.
- Dallas, I never thought I'd say this...

16:15.975 --> 16:18.216
...but let the kangaroo live
in the main house.

16:18.410 --> 16:21.653
Better you wreck your china
than your relationship with your kid.

16:21.814 --> 16:24.727
Well, maybe you've got a point there,
George.

16:24.917 --> 16:26.487
Oh, boy, I tell you.

16:26.652 --> 16:29.292
It isn't easy doing this
parenting thing on your own.

16:29.455 --> 16:32.459
Yeah? I'm so used to doing it on my own,
I have the opposite problem.

16:32.624 --> 16:35.867
- It's tough to let somebody else in.
- I can't stress this enough.

16:36.028 --> 16:38.634
- Hmm?
- Communication is key.

16:38.797 --> 16:41.937
Lord knows, that's one thing
that Steven and I never got right.

16:43.002 --> 16:44.310
Don't run away.

16:44.470 --> 16:47.713
- Go talk to her.
- You're right.

16:47.873 --> 16:48.908
You have that option.

16:49.074 --> 16:52.419
Unlike our kangaroo, Eden speaks English
and she doesn't try to kick you in the gut.

16:52.578 --> 16:55.252
Heh, you sure you don't need help
with the rest of this?

16:55.414 --> 16:58.418
Ugh, Carmen will get it.

16:58.584 --> 17:01.895
That woman loves to clean up after us,
I swear, heh.

17:02.054 --> 17:05.694
You ever notice how we seem to solve
things when we get in a room together?

17:05.858 --> 17:08.896
Now that you mention it,
we do make a pretty good team.

17:09.060 --> 17:13.669
- Yeah, we're like Mulder and Scully.
- Ha, ha, we certainly are.

17:14.665 --> 17:19.080
- It's a TV show.
- Heh, I know, silly. So funny.

17:20.105 --> 17:23.211
Guess you better get home
to your girl, Scully.

17:23.842 --> 17:25.445
Nope.

17:28.981 --> 17:31.757
But I'm terrible at lacrosse
and you're a macramé superstar.

17:31.917 --> 17:34.659
I'm good at everything.
I shouldn't be penalized for that.

17:34.820 --> 17:36.060
I wanna go to sports camp.

17:36.221 --> 17:37.825
Who's thirsty?

17:37.990 --> 17:40.129
Thanks, "Mother."

17:40.292 --> 17:41.999
You're welcome, "Lisa."

17:42.161 --> 17:46.974
Now, I can't help but have overheard
your entire conversation and taken a side.

17:47.132 --> 17:48.839
Lisa, stand by your man.

17:49.902 --> 17:53.850
Malik, that outfit is fly.

17:55.140 --> 17:59.486
Fine. I give up.
Let's go to stupid sports camp.

17:59.645 --> 18:02.057
No. I'll go to macramé camp.

18:02.214 --> 18:06.685
- You need this more than me.
- I really do, Malik. I really do.

18:07.686 --> 18:10.496
I'm gonna weave you
a macramé bikini, girl.

18:13.158 --> 18:14.831
You're gonna look good.

18:14.993 --> 18:17.166
George, I feel terrible.

18:17.329 --> 18:21.903
- I stuck my nose in where it didn't belong.
- Eden, your nose belongs.

18:22.067 --> 18:24.946
Mine just got a little
out of joint for a minute.

18:25.137 --> 18:27.344
I'm sorry I walked out on you.

18:27.506 --> 18:28.541
But I admit...

18:28.707 --> 18:32.553
...I am not used to having someone else
make decisions for Tessa, other than me.

18:32.711 --> 18:34.054
Oh, I totally understand.

18:34.213 --> 18:37.717
It's just... You said I got a vote,
so I thought I got a vote.

18:38.250 --> 18:42.027
Right. Okay, well, the, uh,
the polls have to be open, heh.

18:42.221 --> 18:46.761
- And I just don't think they are on this one.
- It's fine. It's not my district.

18:46.925 --> 18:52.102
I can totally mind my own business where
Tessa is concerned, if that's what you want.

18:52.264 --> 18:56.576
- That's not what I want.
- Oh, hello. Welcome home.

18:56.735 --> 18:59.545
Oh, so now you're perfectly happy
to have Eden chime in...

18:59.705 --> 19:01.309
...as long as she agrees with you.

19:01.473 --> 19:03.453
I could say the same thing about you.

19:03.609 --> 19:06.556
You were happy to give her a vote
when it served your agenda.

19:06.712 --> 19:08.214
Parenting is not an agenda.

19:08.380 --> 19:11.759
I'm sorry, but you're not spending
the summer in Manhattan. There.

19:11.917 --> 19:13.396
You are such a dictator!

19:13.552 --> 19:15.725
Guys. Uh, I know we're still...

19:15.888 --> 19:20.564
...trying to determine if I'm allowed
to weigh in on this, but I have an idea.

19:20.726 --> 19:23.332
You can tell me to shut up,
but what if Tessa commutes?

19:23.495 --> 19:24.997
Shut up.

19:25.397 --> 19:27.399
Ha, ha, just trying to lighten the mood.
Continue.

19:27.566 --> 19:30.012
- So, what if Tessa commutes...?
- Shut up. Sorry.

19:30.202 --> 19:31.909
Shut up, please. Sorry.

19:32.070 --> 19:37.110
I'm sorry. Guess I just have a problem
with those two words, "Tessa commutes"...

19:37.276 --> 19:40.416
- ...when they're together.
- Are you finished?

19:40.579 --> 19:42.252
So, what if your daughter...

19:42.414 --> 19:46.920
...travels to the city to do her
internship, but she comes home at night?

19:47.085 --> 19:48.120
- Shut up.
- Shut up.

19:48.287 --> 19:53.669
- And he gets you a train pass.
- That doesn't sound like a bad compromise.

19:53.825 --> 19:57.864
But then I won't be able to hang out with
my friends after work. Or go out at night.

19:58.030 --> 20:02.001
Or do anything in the city. All I'll see
is the inside of an office building.

20:02.167 --> 20:04.613
Yes, but a New York City office building.

20:04.970 --> 20:08.508
Hey. It could be a lot worse.
It could be a flat-out no.

20:09.875 --> 20:12.378
You should hear the slam
when it's a flat-out no.

20:17.983 --> 20:19.826
So, what's up?

20:19.985 --> 20:23.762
I wanted you to know
that I've decided to 86...

20:24.289 --> 20:26.895
...the scheduled visitations with Eden.

20:27.059 --> 20:28.197
She doesn't enjoy them.

20:28.360 --> 20:32.240
- Frankly, they've become uncomfortable.
- I'm sorry if this is all my fault.

20:32.397 --> 20:35.037
I thought having Eden move in
was the right decision...

20:35.200 --> 20:40.650
- ...but it just pissed everyone off.
- It'll be fine. I'll give Eden some space.

20:41.039 --> 20:43.781
I'll see my baby
when it climbs out of her doughnut hole.

20:45.143 --> 20:47.145
"Her doughnut hole"?
I think you mean her doughnut.

20:47.312 --> 20:51.590
No, I don't. A doughnut hole
is the actual hole in the doughnut.

20:51.750 --> 20:55.721
Oh, yeah? Then how is it that I can buy
a dozen of them, glazed or unglazed?

20:55.887 --> 20:58.925
What you have been purchasing,
my friend, are doughnut balls.

20:59.091 --> 21:01.867
- Heh.
- Deemed doughnut holes by morons.

21:02.027 --> 21:03.904
A hole is negative space.

21:04.596 --> 21:08.339
Well, I think we can all agree
we're in a negative space.

21:18.076 --> 21:20.750
What the hell is wrong with this man?

21:20.946 --> 21:23.893
Kiss her, Mulder, kiss her.

21:25.517 --> 21:28.054
Why the hell won't he kiss her?
