WEBVTT

00:03.960 --> 00:05.959
They then invest that info. Bingo.

00:05.960 --> 00:08.639
You want us to listen
to stock market tips at the office.

00:08.640 --> 00:09.959
Bevan Brothers Steel.

00:09.960 --> 00:11.959
How much will we invest?
It depends on you.

00:11.960 --> 00:13.959
My money.
I will pay you back, OK?

00:13.960 --> 00:15.959
I know we've gone over
Sam's gambling.

00:15.960 --> 00:18.959
I think the girls should come
and live with me full-time.

00:18.960 --> 00:20.959
I want this month's payment
plus the last two you missed.

00:20.960 --> 00:22.959
That's £1,500.
What happened to our payment plan?

00:22.960 --> 00:25.639
The one you failed to pay
for the last two months?

00:25.640 --> 00:26.959
How's your mum doing?
She's all right.

00:26.960 --> 00:29.959
The cafe is struggling and I think
we're gonna have to give it up.

00:29.960 --> 00:33.959
How would you feel about
getting bunkbeds?

00:33.960 --> 00:36.479
I need you to move into Lily's room.
I'm gonna get a lodger in.

00:36.480 --> 00:37.959
My dad wouldn't chuck me
out of my room.

00:37.960 --> 00:40.959
We've made over £250 already.
It's worked!

00:40.960 --> 00:43.959
Mum! What?

00:43.960 --> 00:45.960
It's Alice.

00:53.632 --> 00:55.631
Try her phone again.
She still isn't answering.

00:55.632 --> 00:57.791
'It's Alice.
I'm not about. Leave a message.'

00:57.792 --> 00:59.791
I'm gonna kill her
when I get hold of her.

00:59.792 --> 01:03.087
Where does this Jake live?
That's where she'll have gone.

01:06.792 --> 01:09.791
Hey, Emily.
You haven't seen Alice, have ya?

01:09.792 --> 01:11.791
No, I haven't.
Is everything all right?

01:11.792 --> 01:13.791
She's gone missing
so no, it's not all right.

01:13.792 --> 01:15.791
This Jake she's been seeing,
do you know where he lives?

01:15.792 --> 01:17.791
No, I don't know. Not round here.

01:17.792 --> 01:19.791
Who are you anyway? The police?

01:19.792 --> 01:21.791
Get lost, you useless twat.

01:21.792 --> 01:24.471
Think you're big and clever
in front of your bloody mates?

01:24.472 --> 01:25.991
It's past your bedtime, little man.
It's Dad.

01:25.992 --> 01:28.792
Run over for your bedtime story.
Mum!

01:29.792 --> 01:31.992
What?

01:37.792 --> 01:42.472
Right. Stay there.
Stay in the car, OK?

01:43.792 --> 01:46.311
Where is she?
She's fine. Just calm down.

01:46.312 --> 01:48.791
I need to speak to her.
Look. I've already told her off.

01:48.792 --> 01:51.791
She knows what she's done
and that she shouldn't have done it.

01:51.792 --> 01:52.991
She's gonna stay here
for a few days.

01:52.992 --> 01:56.404
No, no, no. She's not staying here.
Go and get her, please.

01:59.152 --> 02:02.312
Alice. Your mum's here.

02:04.792 --> 02:07.792
Hi, Sam. Hey.

02:08.792 --> 02:12.152
Can I get you a drink or...?
No, thank you.

02:17.792 --> 02:19.471
What is it? What do you want?

02:19.472 --> 02:21.791
What do I want?
I want you to come home.

02:21.792 --> 02:24.791
Stop all this nonsense
and go and get your stuff, please.

02:24.792 --> 02:26.791
I'm not going anywhere.

02:26.792 --> 02:28.791
You seriously wanna stay here,
with her?

02:28.792 --> 02:30.791
At least she doesn't treat me
like a slave.

02:30.792 --> 02:33.791
"Alice, do this. Alice, do that."
That's all I ever get from you.

02:33.792 --> 02:36.791
Darling, I know you're upset, OK?
Just come home.

02:36.792 --> 02:37.792
Come on, we'll talk about it
at home.

02:37.793 --> 02:39.791
You gave away my bedroom
to some random guy.

02:39.792 --> 02:42.791
Why would I come back?
I need my own space, OK?

02:42.792 --> 02:44.791
I'm staying here.

02:44.792 --> 02:46.791
If you won't let me,
I'll tell Dad about the lodger.

02:46.792 --> 02:48.616
He doesn't know about that yet.

02:50.000 --> 02:56.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:05.792 --> 03:07.791
Sleep well. Give me a kiss. Mwah.

03:07.792 --> 03:09.791
I love you.

03:09.792 --> 03:11.471
Mum? Yeah?

03:11.472 --> 03:12.791
When's Alice coming home?

03:12.792 --> 03:15.791
She'll be home soon, I promise.
OK.

03:15.792 --> 03:18.152
Good night, sweetheart.
Night, Mum.

04:13.992 --> 04:15.791
Lily, darling?

04:15.792 --> 04:17.791
I forgot to get sweetcorn

04:17.791 --> 04:20.791
so is it OK to just have
tuna sandwiches today?

04:20.791 --> 04:22.791
Yeah. Good girl.

04:22.792 --> 04:24.791
When I next get paid,
I'll get a big shop in, yeah?

04:24.792 --> 04:27.791
Some nice treats for you.

04:27.792 --> 04:29.832
I'll get it. Thank you.

04:31.792 --> 04:33.204
Hey. Hello, Twinkle Toes.

04:33.792 --> 04:36.311
Mum? It's Jess.

04:36.312 --> 04:38.791
Hey, I just got out of work.
Have you seen the share -

04:38.792 --> 04:40.311
Shh. It's gone through the roof.

04:40.312 --> 04:42.792
Yes, I know, I've seen it. Look.

04:44.152 --> 04:45.791
So, what do you think?
Should we sell?

04:45.792 --> 04:47.791
No, no. Gotta hold on, love.

04:47.792 --> 04:49.791
Don't get out too soon.
Let's just see.

04:49.792 --> 04:51.792
See what happens. OK.

04:52.792 --> 04:53.792
Shh.

04:53.793 --> 04:57.791
Mwah. You be a good girl,
OK, please?

04:57.792 --> 04:58.991
OK. I love you, darling.

04:58.992 --> 05:00.792
Bye. Bye.

05:04.792 --> 05:06.792
All right? Just dropped Alice off.

05:07.792 --> 05:09.831
Lily all right?
Yeah, she's fine.

05:09.832 --> 05:13.791
Has Alice got her exercise book?
She's got a maths test coming up.

05:13.792 --> 05:15.792
Think so. She never said.

05:16.792 --> 05:18.311
So, what is it you want?

05:18.312 --> 05:20.791
It'd be good if you could see things
from my point of view.

05:20.792 --> 05:22.791
Look, I need to get to work.

05:22.792 --> 05:24.791
I know you're a good mum

05:24.792 --> 05:26.791
but the girls need looking after
properly.

05:26.792 --> 05:28.791
You're not even there for 'em
in the evening.

05:28.792 --> 05:30.791
Who's gonna look after Lily now?

05:30.792 --> 05:32.791
I've changed my shifts
and I'm getting a new job

05:32.792 --> 05:34.791
so there won't be a problem,
will there?

05:34.792 --> 05:35.792
You're getting a new job?

05:35.793 --> 05:38.791
Yeah. I have an interview for one
tomorrow, in fact.

05:38.792 --> 05:41.311
Doing what? It's an office job.

05:41.312 --> 05:43.791
It's well paid and it's got
flexible working hours

05:43.792 --> 05:44.792
to fit around the girls.

05:44.793 --> 05:46.791
Great. What's the company called?

05:46.792 --> 05:47.792
Never mind
what the company's called.

05:47.793 --> 05:50.792
It's a good job.
That's all you need to know.

06:06.792 --> 06:08.791
We've only dropped, like,
£5 a share.

06:08.792 --> 06:10.791
'We should've sold this morning.'

06:10.792 --> 06:12.791
Don't know why
I always listen to you.

06:12.792 --> 06:14.991
Hey, you always listen to me
cos I know what's best.

06:14.992 --> 06:16.791
I've steered you
out of no end of trouble.

06:16.792 --> 06:18.791
Just ask your mum.
'Yeah, whatever.'

06:18.792 --> 06:20.791
Look, £22 is still really good.

06:20.792 --> 06:23.991
Let's just sell now
before it drops any more.

06:23.992 --> 06:25.791
SIGHS

06:25.792 --> 06:30.792
OK. OK. I'm gonna sell... at £22.

06:32.792 --> 06:36.791
Done.

06:36.792 --> 06:38.791
So, we've made a £600 profit
so that's £300 each.

06:38.792 --> 06:40.792
Not bad. Yeah.

06:41.792 --> 06:44.791
How much money have you actually got
in your savings account?

06:44.792 --> 06:47.312
Why? You know, for next time.

06:49.792 --> 06:54.791
£2,123.
Two thous... Are you kidding me?

06:54.792 --> 06:59.791
If we'd have put £2,000 down,
we'd have a grand now each.

06:59.792 --> 07:02.471
Yeah, but you know I'm saving that.
I don't wanna touch it.

07:02.472 --> 07:03.791
You could've doubled it.

07:03.792 --> 07:06.791
Don't you see? The more you put in
the more you get out.

07:06.792 --> 07:08.791
That's how it works.
For God's sake.

07:08.792 --> 07:11.791
What? June from next-door,
she can't look after Lily tonight.

07:11.792 --> 07:13.791
Well, where's Alice, though?

07:13.792 --> 07:16.792
She's staying with her dad
for a few nights.

07:21.632 --> 07:23.831
Hello, Sam?
'Glynn, I'm having a nightmare day.

07:23.832 --> 07:26.791
'Is there any chance
you could look after Lily for me?'

07:26.792 --> 07:28.791
OK.
'Great, thank you. Thank you.'

07:28.792 --> 07:30.631
Do I need to feed her or something?

07:30.632 --> 07:32.791
'No, no.
You just need to watch her.'

07:32.792 --> 07:36.632
OK. As in, literally just watch her?

07:38.792 --> 07:41.791
Hey. Hey. I'm gonna...

07:41.792 --> 07:45.152
I'm gonna watch you tonight.
What?

07:46.632 --> 07:51.471
Your neighbour is... I'm gonna...
be watching you tonight.

07:51.472 --> 07:52.791
OK, let's just start this again.

07:52.792 --> 07:54.791
Erm, your babysitter can't make it

07:54.792 --> 07:57.311
so I'm gonna be watching over you
tonight.

07:57.312 --> 08:00.631
You know, like, looking after you.
That's literally all I had to say.

08:00.632 --> 08:02.791
Everything's gonna be fine.
You don't need to worry.

08:02.792 --> 08:04.791
I'm gonna be in my bedroom
if there's anything you need. OK?

08:04.792 --> 08:06.792
OK. Great.

08:11.792 --> 08:14.791
We need to go in again
and we need to go in even bigger.

08:14.792 --> 08:15.991
The full £2,000 this time,

08:15.992 --> 08:18.791
plus the money that we made
from the Bevan Brothers Steel.

08:18.792 --> 08:20.991
I don't know.
We got away with it once.

08:20.992 --> 08:23.791
We made some money. Maybe we should
just be happy with that.

08:23.792 --> 08:25.631
No, look, OK, stop.

08:25.632 --> 08:26.791
You wanna keep
your mum's cafe alive.

08:26.792 --> 08:28.631
Ain't that why we're doing this?

08:28.632 --> 08:30.311
Well, yeah,
but it's still against the law.

08:30.312 --> 08:32.791
I think my mum would much rather
her business go under

08:32.792 --> 08:34.311
than have another one of her kids
in prison.

08:34.312 --> 08:36.791
Come on. That's never gonna happen.

08:36.792 --> 08:39.791
The chances of us getting caught
are, like, a billion to one.

08:39.792 --> 08:42.791
Nobody cares what we do. I care.

08:42.792 --> 08:44.791
So, what, that's it, is it?
You wanna give in?

08:44.792 --> 08:46.791
Give up, be a cleaner
for the rest of your life.

08:46.792 --> 08:48.791
You know I don't want that.
Exactly.

08:48.792 --> 08:51.791
That's why we're gonna raise
the money for your van

08:51.792 --> 08:54.791
and it's gonna be the best coffee
and cake thingy-ma-bob in the land.

08:54.792 --> 08:56.791
Come on, you are a fighter.

08:56.792 --> 08:58.791
I'm not letting you give in, OK?

08:58.792 --> 09:00.791
We've seen it happen once,
it will happen again.

09:00.792 --> 09:02.792
I promise.

09:10.792 --> 09:12.471
Viktor, we're really sorry.

09:12.472 --> 09:13.991
The DLR broke down.

09:13.992 --> 09:16.151
We'd be even later
if we hadn't run all the way.

09:16.152 --> 09:17.791
Ain't that right, Jess?

09:17.792 --> 09:19.791
Yeah. Bloody public transport.
Always lets you down.

09:19.792 --> 09:22.471
I was cleaning at my other job
and they kept me late.

09:22.472 --> 09:25.151
I will work 20 minutes later
to make up time.

09:25.152 --> 09:27.791
How dare you tell me
how late you work?

09:27.792 --> 09:30.791
I decide what times,
I decide what days.

09:30.792 --> 09:34.791
I decide who stays and who goes.
You understand?

09:34.792 --> 09:36.791
I didn't mean to tell you
what to do.

09:36.792 --> 09:38.991
Just... I really need this job.

09:38.992 --> 09:41.792
It won't happen again.

09:58.792 --> 10:00.832
Ooh. Idiot.

10:09.792 --> 10:11.792
Let's go.

10:14.792 --> 10:17.791
Christine
from our research department

10:17.792 --> 10:19.791
did a report on them recently.

10:19.792 --> 10:21.791
Yeah. Erm...

10:21.792 --> 10:23.791
Unstable business model.

10:23.792 --> 10:26.471
That's what she reckons.

10:26.472 --> 10:28.631
'Are we talking
about the same company here?

10:28.632 --> 10:30.792
They make 3D printers.'

10:31.792 --> 10:33.791
'If that information is reliable,

10:33.792 --> 10:36.311
they're gonna blow
the competition away.

10:36.312 --> 10:38.472
'When's the announcement?'

10:39.792 --> 10:41.791
'That's this weekend. OK, look.

10:41.792 --> 10:44.791
'Everything you have
in their rivals, you should sell.

10:44.792 --> 10:45.792
'OK? Cos by the sounds of it,

10:45.793 --> 10:48.382
their stocks are about to drop
like a stone.'

10:48.792 --> 10:51.791
Hello, mate.
Is this a good time?

10:51.792 --> 10:54.792
'One sec. Yeah. I'll call you back.'

11:05.792 --> 11:09.792
'What's this, then?'

11:12.654 --> 11:15.293
Who are they? I don't know.

11:15.294 --> 11:17.294
It doesn't look good.

11:24.294 --> 11:26.653
Sam, what are you doing?
I wanna hear what they're saying.

11:26.654 --> 11:29.493
Come back. Sam. Shit.

11:29.494 --> 11:31.293
Is that it? Yeah.

11:31.294 --> 11:33.293
We need to find out
who's behind this.

11:33.294 --> 11:36.293
Check if there's any more
surveillance anywhere immediately.

11:36.294 --> 11:38.293
And your hard drives,
we'll need to take those.

11:38.294 --> 11:41.293
What for?
To run some diagnostics.

11:41.294 --> 11:43.493
Someone could have been spying
on your trading accounts.

11:43.494 --> 11:45.293
You do realise
how serious this is, Blake?

11:45.294 --> 11:47.293
OK, but that's ridiculous.

11:47.294 --> 11:49.333
What is it? What did they say?

11:49.334 --> 11:51.293
They don't think it's us, do they?

11:51.294 --> 11:54.883
No, I think we're the last people
in the world they'd suspect.

11:55.294 --> 11:58.293
He's not gonna be talking
in his office, any more, though.

11:58.294 --> 12:01.133
Even if we still had
the listening device.

12:01.134 --> 12:03.494
Hey. We do have this.

12:06.294 --> 12:07.493
You heard what he said.

12:07.494 --> 12:09.293
Some company that makes 3D printers

12:09.294 --> 12:11.293
is making a big announcement
this weekend.

12:11.294 --> 12:13.293
They're gonna blow
the competition away.

12:13.294 --> 12:15.813
Yeah, but we didn't get a name.

12:15.814 --> 12:17.293
No, but he did say that

12:17.294 --> 12:19.293
some woman called Christine,
who worked in research,

12:19.294 --> 12:21.133
did a report on them.

12:21.134 --> 12:22.293
That's downstairs. So what?

12:22.294 --> 12:24.493
So all we need to do is
track her down, find the report

12:24.494 --> 12:26.333
and then we'll know
the name of the company.

12:26.334 --> 12:28.293
Yeah, right. We just track her down,

12:28.294 --> 12:31.293
use our high-power computer skills
to log into her hard drive.

12:31.294 --> 12:34.293
Look, maybe we should just cool it
for now, you know?

12:34.294 --> 12:36.293
Try and stay out of trouble.

12:36.294 --> 12:38.293
Time is of the essence.
You know how it works.

12:38.294 --> 12:40.293
Come on, we have to find out
the name of this company

12:40.294 --> 12:41.333
before that announcement.

12:41.334 --> 12:43.294
Jess, I really need this.

12:46.294 --> 12:48.293
She makes it so difficult.

12:48.294 --> 12:52.293
She's an addict.
Of course it's gonna be difficult.

12:52.294 --> 12:53.654
Yeah.

12:54.814 --> 12:56.973
Have you talked to her
about the rent yet?

12:56.974 --> 12:59.293
No, not yet. I will.

12:59.294 --> 13:02.294
You know I'm with you all the way
with this, right?

13:06.334 --> 13:08.494
What's the matter?

13:11.814 --> 13:14.294
I just worry
if I'm doing the right thing.

13:15.294 --> 13:18.293
I think you are.

13:18.294 --> 13:22.293
And... I think it's good
Alice stays here for a while.

13:22.294 --> 13:24.293
When we get Lily too,

13:24.294 --> 13:27.824
hopefully it'll give Sam
the push she needs to get some help.

13:50.294 --> 13:53.293
You look very smart.
Thank you, Glynn.

13:53.294 --> 13:56.293
Who did you say had died?
Nobody.

13:56.294 --> 13:58.293
I've got an interview
at a recruitment centre.

13:58.294 --> 14:00.293
Right. I must've been thinking
of someone else.

14:00.294 --> 14:03.293
So you're still OK
for this afternoon?

14:03.294 --> 14:04.294
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, that's OK.

14:04.295 --> 14:06.973
Are you sure? Cos if you've got
plans with your uni friends,

14:06.974 --> 14:08.293
I can always ask her dad.

14:08.294 --> 14:10.293
No, I'm happy to do it.
OK, great, thank you.

14:10.294 --> 14:13.293
I'll let the school know.
OK. Wish me luck.

14:13.294 --> 14:15.294
Good luck.

14:21.294 --> 14:23.294
'Spin again.'

14:27.294 --> 14:30.294
'Spin again.'

14:42.814 --> 14:47.293
Well, I've been a full-time mum now
for many years, raising two girls.

14:47.294 --> 14:49.293
I don't know if either of you
have got kids

14:49.294 --> 14:52.294
but, as you know,
that is quite a job.

14:54.294 --> 14:57.293
Before that I was a dancer.

14:57.294 --> 15:00.294
Did a couple of musicals,
played Nancy in Oliver.

15:01.294 --> 15:05.293
But yeah, sadly, those days
are well and truly behind me now.

15:05.294 --> 15:08.293
Great times but yeah.

15:08.294 --> 15:10.293
Well, musicals.

15:10.294 --> 15:13.293
Sounds very exciting,
doesn't it, Ruth?

15:13.294 --> 15:15.293
Yes. Very exciting.

15:15.294 --> 15:17.973
Do you have any experience
in an office?

15:17.974 --> 15:20.133
Most of our clients
are in the admin sector.

15:20.134 --> 15:22.293
Well, I currently clean
in an office.

15:22.294 --> 15:23.294
I gather that's not what you mean.

15:23.295 --> 15:26.293
No, I mean on a computer.

15:26.294 --> 15:28.293
How are you
at office-based software?

15:28.294 --> 15:31.293
Microsoft Word, Excel,
those sorts of things.

15:31.294 --> 15:34.133
Well, my husband used to run
his own plumbing business

15:34.134 --> 15:35.493
and I would take care of the books.

15:35.494 --> 15:39.293
You should've seen these things.
Works of art, they were.

15:39.294 --> 15:42.293
That's great.
So they were hand-written.

15:42.294 --> 15:44.293
You didn't use a computer?

15:44.294 --> 15:46.293
Software like Excel,
something like that?

15:46.294 --> 15:50.293
They were hand-written, yeah,
but Excel, of course, yeah.

15:50.294 --> 15:52.293
I mean, I've used that
loads of times.

15:52.294 --> 15:54.493
I'm very familiar
with that software. Yeah.

15:54.494 --> 15:58.293
Well, that's great. Isn't it, Ruth?

15:58.294 --> 16:00.294
Yeah. That's really good.

16:01.294 --> 16:04.293
OK. Well, I don't want you to panic

16:04.294 --> 16:07.293
cos someone with your experience
won't find this a problem

16:07.294 --> 16:10.293
but we have been doing a little test
with all of our new recruits.

16:10.294 --> 16:12.133
If you just turn around,

16:12.134 --> 16:14.293
you'll see the computer
in the booth behind you.

16:14.294 --> 16:18.293
Number four.
Like I said, nothing to worry about.

16:18.294 --> 16:22.293
Just a few tasks and questions
on Excel to gauge your competency.

16:22.294 --> 16:25.706
Won't take long. Then we can
carry on with our little chat.

16:26.294 --> 16:28.293
You mean now?

16:28.294 --> 16:30.133
Yeah.

16:30.134 --> 16:32.294
Erm, OK.

16:33.115 --> 16:35.115
Yeah, I'll just leave that there.

16:40.115 --> 16:42.115
Number four, was it?

17:22.115 --> 17:25.114
Everything OK? What's the problem?

17:25.115 --> 17:30.954
Er... I think I may have exaggerated
my capabilities on Excel

17:30.955 --> 17:33.115
ever so slightly.

17:36.155 --> 17:38.315
Thanks for your time.

18:06.635 --> 18:09.794
'Welcome to Ladies Night Casino.

18:09.795 --> 18:11.115
'Out of funds.'

19:54.350 --> 19:56.350
Called Tom about any work lately?

19:59.350 --> 20:00.350
Chris?

20:00.351 --> 20:03.349
No. He's brought in
a bunch of Polish guys.

20:03.350 --> 20:05.349
I ain't working for them prices.

20:05.350 --> 20:08.939
Can't just sit around the flat
playing computer games all day.

20:09.350 --> 20:11.349
What about Sam's Dave?

20:11.350 --> 20:13.349
He often knows a chippy
looking for a helping hand.

20:13.350 --> 20:15.390
Yeah, I'll get on it.

20:18.350 --> 20:20.349
I'm going out tonight, by the way.

20:20.350 --> 20:22.468
There's some nuggets in the freezer.

20:23.550 --> 20:25.869
Maybe stick them in the oven
when you get home.

20:25.870 --> 20:28.350
Great, thanks.

20:34.350 --> 20:37.349
I don't care. Where's my mum?

20:37.350 --> 20:40.389
Your mum said that she had something
she had to do this afternoon

20:40.390 --> 20:42.349
so I said I didn't mind getting you.

20:42.350 --> 20:45.349
Saphira's supposed to be
coming round for tea tonight.

20:45.350 --> 20:47.349
Your mum didn't say anything
about that.

20:47.350 --> 20:51.349
She must've forgot.
She comes round every Wednesday.

20:51.350 --> 20:54.350
Yeah. OK.

20:57.350 --> 20:59.349
Hey, Sam, it's me, Glynn.

20:59.350 --> 21:01.189
Just wondering
when you might be home.

21:01.190 --> 21:03.349
Don't worry, nothing's happened

21:03.350 --> 21:05.349
but just give me a call
when you get this, OK?

21:05.350 --> 21:08.349
Hey, Glynn. Look, I'm Lady Gaga.

21:08.350 --> 21:10.349
Got it! Hey!

21:10.350 --> 21:12.349
Right, no. Girls, girls, girls.
Just stop, all right?

21:12.350 --> 21:14.762
You're gonna hurt yourselves.
Please stop.

21:21.350 --> 21:24.349
Hi.

21:24.350 --> 21:26.189
Is Sam in? Not right now, no.

21:26.190 --> 21:28.349
Maybe you can help. I was a bit late
getting to school today

21:28.350 --> 21:30.389
but when I got there,
Saphira was already gone.

21:30.390 --> 21:32.549
People said they saw her go home
with Lily.

21:32.550 --> 21:36.349
Glynn. Mum.

21:36.350 --> 21:38.030
What the hell's going on?

21:38.609 --> 21:39.609
Sorry.

21:48.030 --> 21:49.350
Come on.

22:36.350 --> 22:38.390
Hello. Glynn?

22:42.077 --> 22:46.076
What? Yeah, no. OK, yeah.

22:46.077 --> 22:48.077
Erm... I'll be home in 20 minutes.

22:49.077 --> 22:51.077
OK, bye.

22:54.917 --> 22:56.076
Sorry.

22:56.077 --> 22:58.076
OK, but do you know what
you're saying sorry for?

22:58.077 --> 23:00.116
Cos sorry on its own
doesn't mean anything.

23:00.117 --> 23:02.276
You lied, Lily.

23:02.277 --> 23:05.076
You told a lie,
that's what I'm cross about.

23:05.077 --> 23:08.076
You lied to Glynn, you had
Saphira's mum scared half to death.

23:08.077 --> 23:10.436
I'll be in trouble with the school
over this.

23:10.437 --> 23:13.076
I want you to apologise to Glynn
and I want you to mean it, OK?

23:13.077 --> 23:15.076
I didn't mean to get you in trouble.

23:15.077 --> 23:17.117
I know you didn't.

23:19.277 --> 23:21.437
What else is the matter?

23:23.277 --> 23:26.076
Come on. Tell me.

23:26.077 --> 23:29.076
Do you think I could stay with Dad
for a couple of days?

23:29.077 --> 23:32.076
Er, what? Erm...

23:32.077 --> 23:34.076
Is that what you want?

23:34.077 --> 23:36.076
I thought you liked
living here with me.

23:36.077 --> 23:39.076
I do. It's just, you're never here,
you're at work.

23:39.077 --> 23:41.077
And I miss Alice.

23:42.077 --> 23:44.076
OK. Yeah, I'll talk to your dad
about it.

23:44.077 --> 23:48.077
Why don't you go upstairs and wash
that stuff off your face, OK?

23:56.077 --> 23:57.077
SIGHS

23:57.078 --> 24:00.077
I've been trying to call you.
Look what I found.

24:01.077 --> 24:02.596
Wow. Yeah, that's great.

24:02.597 --> 24:05.076
It needs a bit of work
but I managed to talk the guy down

24:05.077 --> 24:07.916
from £3,500 to £2,800.

24:07.917 --> 24:10.076
It'll be tight but...
with what I've got in savings

24:10.077 --> 24:12.436
and the money in our shares account,
I've got just enough to cover it.

24:12.437 --> 24:15.076
I'll struggle to find another one
this good for that price.

24:15.077 --> 24:17.756
What do you think?

24:17.757 --> 24:20.076
Yeah, no, it's great.

24:20.077 --> 24:22.077
What's the problem?

24:24.077 --> 24:26.076
I've let you down, OK,
but I'll get all the money back.

24:26.077 --> 24:29.077
I promise.
How much do we have left?

24:36.077 --> 24:38.077
You spent all of it.

24:40.077 --> 24:42.436
You've not been gambling again,
have ya?

24:42.437 --> 24:45.076
You were doing so well.
No, I just...

24:45.077 --> 24:46.436
You know how things are
at the moment.

24:46.437 --> 24:49.077
I just needed it
to pay some legal fees.

24:50.077 --> 24:52.076
Jess, I'm so sorry.

24:52.077 --> 24:55.076
We'll get it all back, though.
We'll get you an even bigger van.

24:55.077 --> 24:57.076
One with all the mod-cons.

24:57.077 --> 24:59.076
This 3D company, that's the answer.

24:59.077 --> 25:01.076
We just need to get inside
the research department,

25:01.077 --> 25:04.596
find out who this Christine woman is
and then find her report.

25:04.597 --> 25:06.116
That'll give us the name -
No, thanks.

25:06.117 --> 25:08.076
I'll get your money back.

25:08.077 --> 25:10.783
You shouldn't have taken it
in the first place.

27:15.576 --> 27:17.576
Thank you.

28:01.789 --> 28:03.575
Hello, Kramer Lowe.

28:03.576 --> 28:06.575
'Hi. I'm just calling
from reception in the lobby.

28:06.576 --> 28:09.358
'You've got a package here
for Christine.

28:09.360 --> 28:11.679
'She needs to come down
and sign for it.'

28:11.681 --> 28:13.975
'OK. Thanks.' Thanks.

28:14.009 --> 28:17.008
Chris, there's a package
waiting for you down at reception.

28:17.009 --> 28:19.009
OK.

29:13.009 --> 29:16.008
Mina. What are you doing here?

29:16.009 --> 29:18.848
Can I have a word with you?
It'll take a minute.

29:18.849 --> 29:22.008
I have seven more bathrooms to clean
before five and I'm already behind.

29:22.009 --> 29:23.009
This won't take long.

29:23.010 --> 29:26.008
You clean this floor, right?
Yeah.

29:26.009 --> 29:28.008
OK, well, this is gonna sound
a little strange

29:28.009 --> 29:29.368
but I need your help with something.

29:29.369 --> 29:31.008
Listen, now is not good.

29:31.009 --> 29:33.008
It'll take one minute.
Please. I promise.

29:33.009 --> 29:34.848
Viktor is trying to test me.

29:34.849 --> 29:37.008
He will kick me out
if I don't finish on time today.

29:37.009 --> 29:39.008
Come on, he won't kick you out.

29:39.009 --> 29:42.009
Who would he get to do
all the translating?

29:43.009 --> 29:45.528
OK, OK, look, I'll pay you
to help me.

29:45.529 --> 29:47.008
You'll pay me. Yeah.

29:47.009 --> 29:48.528
To do what?

29:48.529 --> 29:51.688
This is a no-question-asked
type scenario.

29:51.689 --> 29:53.008
I need two things.

29:53.009 --> 29:55.008
One, I need to borrow your pass.

29:55.009 --> 29:58.008
Two, I need you to break the glass
on the fire alarm out there.

29:58.009 --> 30:00.008
Why do you need me to do that?

30:00.009 --> 30:02.008
I just need you to, OK?

30:02.009 --> 30:06.529
For no-questions-asked,
I will pay you... £50.

30:07.689 --> 30:09.008
I don't know, Sam.

30:09.009 --> 30:11.008
I can't afford to lose this job.

30:11.009 --> 30:12.528
All you've gotta do
is break the glass,

30:12.529 --> 30:14.008
run down the stairs
and I'll give you £50.

30:14.009 --> 30:15.528
That's all.

30:15.529 --> 30:18.008
Plus, there's no way you could get
all those toilets cleaned

30:18.009 --> 30:20.208
if there's a fire in the building,
could you?

30:20.209 --> 30:26.009
OK. But for no questions,
I think I need £100.

30:33.209 --> 30:35.528
Not a drill, guys.
Come on, everybody out.

30:35.529 --> 30:37.009
Musical chairs.

31:27.009 --> 31:29.049
Check the toilet again.

32:43.940 --> 32:46.579
Who was that? Just Sam.

32:46.580 --> 32:49.099
How's she getting on now?

32:49.100 --> 32:51.260
Yeah, she's OK.

32:52.580 --> 32:56.579
You know what? I reckon you two
should do something together.

32:56.580 --> 32:59.579
And I don't mean cleaning.

32:59.580 --> 33:02.779
You're both too smart
to be wiping shitty toilets.

33:02.780 --> 33:05.579
Yeah, but, you know,
that's just a temporary thing.

33:05.580 --> 33:07.580
Look, this is what I want.

33:08.580 --> 33:10.579
I've got it all worked out.

33:10.580 --> 33:13.579
I just need to get a bit more money
so I can get a van

33:13.580 --> 33:15.420
and then we'll be sorted.

33:17.420 --> 33:18.579
It's a good idea, love,

33:18.580 --> 33:21.579
but I don't know if I can face
starting all over again.

33:21.580 --> 33:22.580
But it wouldn't be.

33:22.581 --> 33:26.579
Look, I know, it's scary.

33:26.580 --> 33:28.580
But I'll make it work.

33:43.580 --> 33:45.619
Turn that down, shall we?

33:45.620 --> 33:47.579
I was listening to that.

33:47.580 --> 33:50.580
I know, but it's a bit loud,
isn't it?

33:53.580 --> 33:55.579
So, girls.

33:55.580 --> 33:58.579
I was wondering what you might like
to eat for supper this evening.

33:58.580 --> 34:01.580
I was thinking linguine
with pesto and spinach?

34:02.580 --> 34:04.579
What's linguine? It's a pasta.

34:04.580 --> 34:07.579
It's like spaghetti
but flat, not round.

34:07.580 --> 34:09.579
Is it like Spaghetti Hoops?

34:09.580 --> 34:10.639
No. No, not quite.

34:11.620 --> 34:14.579
Alice?
Yeah, don't worry about me.

34:14.580 --> 34:16.579
Where are you going?
I'm heading out.

34:16.580 --> 34:18.579
Can I come? No.

34:18.580 --> 34:22.099
You're not staying for supper?
Your dad didn't mention anything.

34:22.100 --> 34:24.579
Yeah, I spoke to him earlier.
He's cool.

34:24.580 --> 34:26.579
I'll just grab something later.

34:26.580 --> 34:28.522
Tell him I'll be back around ten.

34:32.580 --> 34:34.757
Looks like
it's just you and me, then.

34:35.940 --> 34:38.099
What are you drawing?

34:38.100 --> 34:40.260
Can I have a look?

34:44.260 --> 34:46.418
I copied this from a magazine
at school.

34:46.420 --> 34:48.579
All right.

34:48.580 --> 34:49.580
Yeah, your dad told me
you liked drawing

34:49.581 --> 34:51.579
but I had no idea
you were this good.

34:51.580 --> 34:53.619
You know I love art too?

34:53.620 --> 34:57.579
No.
Yeah. I love to paint when I can.

34:57.580 --> 34:59.579
I find it relaxes me.

34:59.580 --> 35:01.579
I'm not as good as you, though.

35:01.580 --> 35:04.580
These are extraordinary.

35:17.580 --> 35:21.580
Look at him. Punching a bag.
That's no big thing.

35:22.580 --> 35:23.580
You think you could do better?

35:23.581 --> 35:25.579
Course I can.
My mum could punch harder than that.

35:25.580 --> 35:27.579
It's not all about
how hard you punch.

35:27.580 --> 35:31.579
It's about rhythm,
technique, movement.

35:31.580 --> 35:34.259
In that case, I've got 11 years
of dance school behind me.

35:34.260 --> 35:36.579
I could out-move you all day long.

35:36.580 --> 35:38.579
Sorry, does it look like
we're doing ballet in here?

35:38.580 --> 35:41.579
I don't know what it looks like
but it doesn't look like much.

35:41.580 --> 35:43.579
So you're a big talker, yeah?
All right, cool.

35:43.580 --> 35:45.579
Put your money
where your mouth is, then.

35:45.580 --> 35:49.579
OK. They're all sweaty
and horrible.

35:49.580 --> 35:51.940
All right, start off slowly, yeah?

35:53.260 --> 35:55.579
The bag's quite heavy,
you don't wanna hurt your wrist.

35:55.580 --> 35:57.580
OK.

35:59.580 --> 36:01.620
Like that? Yeah.

36:03.580 --> 36:05.579
Whoa, OK, OK, easy, tiger.
We're not...

36:05.580 --> 36:08.579
We're not trying to knock
anyone's head off here.

36:08.580 --> 36:10.580
You might not be.

36:29.580 --> 36:32.579
Working a little late today,
aren't we, Sam?

36:32.580 --> 36:34.579
You're usually on the school run
by now.

36:34.580 --> 36:37.419
The girls are with their dad today.
Not that it's any of your business.

36:37.420 --> 36:39.579
I'm starting to take it personally,
you not returning my texts,

36:39.580 --> 36:41.779
but do you know
what really puzzles me?

36:41.780 --> 36:43.939
Why someone
who's desperately short on money

36:43.940 --> 36:46.579
still wears their wedding ring
and their engagement ring,

36:46.580 --> 36:48.579
despite claiming that
they recently got divorced.

36:48.580 --> 36:51.259
I don't know
what sort of sentimental value

36:51.260 --> 36:53.579
you place on jewellery
from your divorced husband

36:53.580 --> 36:55.579
but if you're struggling
to pay the £17,000,

36:55.580 --> 36:57.579
something like that'd
certainly help.

36:57.580 --> 37:00.259
I don't believe you're waiting
on a court settlement.

37:00.260 --> 37:02.579
I really don't want the bailiffs
getting involved in all this.

37:02.580 --> 37:05.939
It'd be very traumatic
for the children - your children.

37:05.940 --> 37:09.259
I need something today, Sam.
Might as well be those rings.

37:09.260 --> 37:11.579
I can't give you my rings.
Don't be an idiot.

37:11.580 --> 37:13.579
I'll have the bailiffs
round your house in 20 minutes.

37:13.580 --> 37:15.580
You'll end up losing them anyway.

37:18.580 --> 37:20.579
What are you doing?

37:20.580 --> 37:22.579
You said you needed something today.

37:22.580 --> 37:24.579
Here you go. What, your car?

37:24.580 --> 37:26.619
I don't know
how much you'll get for it.

37:26.620 --> 37:28.579
There's about 80,000 on the clock

37:28.580 --> 37:30.579
but the MOT's not due
till next March.

37:30.580 --> 37:33.757
If you don't mind, I need to go.
I need to get to work.

37:51.580 --> 37:53.580
You all right, Jess?

38:35.580 --> 38:39.419
You're back early.
Wanna watch TV?

38:39.420 --> 38:42.579
No, I'm all right. I'm a bit tired.
I'm just gonna go to bed.

38:42.580 --> 38:44.580
All right, suit yourself.

39:14.580 --> 39:17.579
Hey, Jess. You OK?

39:17.580 --> 39:22.579
Yep.
Look, I'm so sorry about everything.

39:22.580 --> 39:25.419
I hate this, please. Maybe we can go
for a drink after work

39:25.420 --> 39:27.579
and go through those reports
together?

39:27.580 --> 39:29.286
No, thanks. I gotta get back.

39:30.580 --> 39:32.579
Hey, what's up?
I've come for my money.

39:32.580 --> 39:34.579
£100, like you said.

39:34.580 --> 39:36.579
Yeah, I don't have it
on me right now.

39:36.580 --> 39:39.579
I'm gonna get it, obviously,
but I don't have it just now.

39:39.580 --> 39:42.579
How long must I wait?
Because I really need it.

39:42.580 --> 39:45.100
Soon. I'm just waiting on something.

40:05.580 --> 40:08.580
You're suspended,
pending an investigation.

40:10.100 --> 40:14.099
Excuse me? What is it
I'm supposed to have done?

40:14.100 --> 40:17.100
We found some anomalies
on your original hard drive.

40:18.580 --> 40:20.579
Another greedy pig banker.

40:20.580 --> 40:21.580
Stealing from everybody

40:21.581 --> 40:24.579
while we wipe their tables
and clean their toilets.

40:24.580 --> 40:27.579
This is ridiculous.
I spit on them.

40:27.580 --> 40:29.580
You're making a big mistake.

40:46.580 --> 40:50.940
OK. Skytech Instruments
deal with aeroplanes.

40:54.580 --> 40:56.580
Jenkins Blue are finance.

41:00.420 --> 41:02.580
Redstein Group.

41:05.580 --> 41:07.580
It's a 3D printing company.

41:24.580 --> 41:28.580
Glynn? Glynn!

41:29.580 --> 41:32.579
Sam. Didn't know you were there.
Is everything OK?

41:32.580 --> 41:34.579
Erm, is my music too loud?

41:34.580 --> 41:36.419
No, no, everything's fine.

41:36.420 --> 41:38.579
I just wondered,
are you busy right now?

41:38.580 --> 41:39.580
No. Unfortunately not.

41:39.581 --> 41:42.579
I got this from a scrapyard
yesterday afternoon.

41:42.580 --> 41:45.579
The guy said it was completely dead.
I just checked it over.

41:45.580 --> 41:48.579
It just needs a new fuse,
the cylinder's come loose

41:48.580 --> 41:49.580
and the waste pipe's blocked.

41:49.581 --> 41:51.579
It's gonna take me ten minutes
to fix.

41:51.580 --> 41:54.579
Right. You're disappointed
because that's too quick?

41:54.580 --> 41:56.259
Well, yeah. Yeah, yeah.

41:53.260 --> 41:55.579
It's a washing machine.
That was my weekend project.

41:55.580 --> 41:58.580
Right, I see.
Sorry, I was just gonna ask...

41:59.580 --> 42:01.579
instead of paying me weekly,

42:01.580 --> 42:05.579
is it possible you could pay me
one lump sum every month?

42:05.580 --> 42:08.579
Whatever's easiest. How come?

42:08.580 --> 42:10.579
Just so I can organise my finances.

42:10.580 --> 42:13.579
So, could you start this morning,
with this month's rent?

42:13.580 --> 42:15.579
£600, that'd be great.

42:15.580 --> 42:17.619
Erm, yeah. I'll see what I can do.

42:17.620 --> 42:19.579
Thank you, Glynn.

42:19.580 --> 42:22.579
Erm, I was just wondering,

42:22.580 --> 42:25.579
what's happening with your friend
Jess and her boyfriend?

42:25.580 --> 42:28.579
I haven't seen her in a while
and I just erm...

42:28.580 --> 42:31.259
I just was wondering, did she...?

42:31.260 --> 42:34.579
You know, was he...?

42:34.580 --> 42:37.099
Er, I don't know.

42:37.100 --> 42:40.579
No, I don't know.
She's not told me yet.

42:40.580 --> 42:41.580
OK.

42:41.581 --> 42:43.580
Thanks. Cheers, Glynn.

42:48.580 --> 42:52.420
Alice, what's wrong?
'Mum, you need to come and get me.'

42:54.580 --> 42:55.580
Where's the car?
What's happened?

42:55.581 --> 42:57.579
Nothing. Who's done this?

42:57.580 --> 42:59.579
Some 17-year-old thug
she's been seeing, that's who.

42:59.580 --> 43:00.939
Jake did this?

43:00.940 --> 43:02.579
It was an accident, OK?
You know about this?

43:02.580 --> 43:04.579
I met him at his boxing gym.
I was messing around.

43:04.580 --> 43:07.579
Boxing and sex with 15-year-olds.
Do you know that's against the law?

43:07.580 --> 43:10.579
Statutory rape, that's called.
Jesus, I haven't had sex with him!

43:10.580 --> 43:12.579
Good. Cos if you had,
I'd be ringing the police right now.

43:12.580 --> 43:14.619
I think we're getting carried away,
don't you?

43:14.620 --> 43:18.579
Alice said it was an accident.
Let me see this properly.

43:18.580 --> 43:20.579
Have you given her ice
to take the swelling down?

43:20.580 --> 43:22.779
No. He's more bothered with being
ridiculous and telling me off.

43:22.780 --> 43:25.579
That's not true. I think it's best
the girls come home with me.

43:25.580 --> 43:27.580
Tell Lily to get her things.

43:31.580 --> 43:34.579
Mum, where is the car?
The head gasket's gone.

43:34.580 --> 43:37.579
It's a total write-off
so we're on the DLR, I'm afraid.

43:37.580 --> 43:38.580
Give me your bags, darling.

43:38.581 --> 43:40.099
I hope you've learnt your lesson

43:40.100 --> 43:41.939
and it's the last time
you'll be in a boxing gym.

43:41.940 --> 43:43.579
Why is that, then?

43:43.580 --> 43:45.579
Well, look at your face,
there's your answer.

43:45.580 --> 43:47.619
People punching each other,
it should've been banned years ago.

43:47.620 --> 43:50.579
Stick with your dancing.
That requires grace and elegance.

43:50.580 --> 43:52.579
Control and discipline.
That is an artform.

43:52.580 --> 43:54.579
I think boxing's an art form.
Really?

43:54.580 --> 43:56.619
Yeah, I do.
I think I wanna give it another go.

43:56.620 --> 43:58.779
I like it.

43:58.780 --> 44:00.939
That's good.

44:00.940 --> 44:02.579
Gone out the lines
a little bit there.

44:02.580 --> 44:04.580
It's OK, I can fix it. I know.

44:07.580 --> 44:12.579
'The next train on platform two
is for Lewisham.'

44:12.580 --> 44:14.579
'I didn't realise
it was that bad.

44:14.580 --> 44:17.579
'I really caught you there, sorry.'
No, it was my fault.

44:17.580 --> 44:19.579
It looks worse than it is.
It doesn't hurt.

44:19.580 --> 44:22.579
'So, you still wanna swing by again
on Monday? Give it another go?'

44:22.580 --> 44:24.579
Yeah. Yeah, definitely.

44:24.580 --> 44:26.579
I mean, if you don't mind
me tagging along.

44:26.580 --> 44:29.579
'No, no. Just remember
to keep your hands up this time.

44:29.580 --> 44:31.419
'We don't want the same
on the other eye.'

44:31.420 --> 44:33.579
Yeah, I will, yeah. Er...

44:33.580 --> 44:36.780
So I'll see you Monday, yeah?
'Yeah. Catch you later.'

44:52.940 --> 44:55.580
Shit.

44:56.580 --> 44:58.580
There's two companies.
