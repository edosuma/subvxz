17:09.571 --> 17:11.198
Thank you for coming in.

17:11.281 --> 17:13.575
I have this ongoing battle with the sun.

17:13.659 --> 17:16.078
I used to love it.
I fried myself like bacon.

17:16.161 --> 17:18.997
But then I had skin cancer
a couple years back,

17:19.081 --> 17:21.458
so I never spend
more than 10 minutes outside at a time.

17:21.542 --> 17:23.168
I still get melanomas.

17:23.252 --> 17:24.962
It's global warming.

17:25.045 --> 17:26.880
We're all gonna get cancer.

17:26.964 --> 17:30.217
Had to quit my job.
I was in pharmaceuticals.

17:30.300 --> 17:33.595
I work from home now, and Etsy is my life.

17:33.679 --> 17:37.140
-Big Nicole Kidman fans, huh?
-Oh, the biggest.

17:37.224 --> 17:40.185
We're co-vice presidents
of the Michigan chapter of her fan club.

17:40.269 --> 17:42.729
Have you seen <i>Big Little Lies?</i>
She's transcendent.

17:42.813 --> 17:44.314
Sweetheart,

17:44.398 --> 17:46.650
-your gay is showing.
-Wait, I'm...

17:46.733 --> 17:48.277
You're gay?

17:48.360 --> 17:49.736
Yeah. (CHUCKLES)

17:49.820 --> 17:52.030
We were besties in high school
and we made a pact.

17:52.114 --> 17:54.825
If we weren't married by 35,
we'd marry each other.

17:54.908 --> 17:58.662
He gets one night a week
in Detroit to do whatever.

17:58.745 --> 18:03.041
And the rule is no making a fool of me
and take your Truvada.

18:03.125 --> 18:04.835
And, you know, Meadow doesn't
really like to be touched

18:04.918 --> 18:08.422
because of her cancer, so...

18:08.505 --> 18:10.132
Kind of all works out.

18:13.051 --> 18:17.055
Wow. Uh, you know,
we have just blathered on, haven't we?

18:17.139 --> 18:18.265
Tell us about you.

18:20.601 --> 18:23.061
We need to go, um, actually.

18:23.145 --> 18:25.397
We need to get Oz into the bath.

18:25.480 --> 18:27.149
-Oh.
-But thank you so much

18:27.232 --> 18:28.775
for your hospitality.

18:28.859 --> 18:30.444
Well, drop by anytime,

18:30.527 --> 18:33.071
if you want to hang or watch Bravo
or something.

18:33.155 --> 18:35.032
I watch all the <i>Real Housewives,</i>
even <i>Atlanta.</i>

18:35.115 --> 18:38.827
-Hey, do you go to SoulCycle?
-And, if you ever want a real workout,

18:38.911 --> 18:41.330
I'm a trainer over at
Funtime Fitness in Northville.

18:41.413 --> 18:43.373
Oh, I'm addicted to Pilates.

18:43.457 --> 18:44.708
Doesn't it upset you?

18:46.710 --> 18:50.214
To be here so soon after what happened?

18:50.297 --> 18:52.299
We don't scare easily.

19:03.185 --> 19:05.187
It was nice meeting you.

19:07.564 --> 19:09.149
ALLY: Ozzie?

19:11.485 --> 19:14.947
Yeah, they're eccentric,
but they seem nice enough.

19:15.030 --> 19:17.449
Ivy, come on, the barrels?

19:17.533 --> 19:20.244
What is that about?
What could they possibly be storing

19:20.327 --> 19:22.371
in such mass quantities?

19:22.454 --> 19:25.082
What they do is none of our business.

19:25.165 --> 19:27.084
You aren't at all suspicious?

19:27.167 --> 19:28.710
-No. (LAUGHS)
-Why not? It's so str...

19:28.794 --> 19:30.671
-Moms.
-Hi, honey.

19:30.754 --> 19:32.798
-I can't sleep.
-Sweetheart,

19:32.881 --> 19:35.551
we told you not to eat chocolate
before you go to sleep.

19:35.634 --> 19:37.928
-I didn't.
-Ozzie.

19:38.011 --> 19:41.014
I don't want to sleep in my bedroom.

19:41.098 --> 19:43.308
I'm scared.

19:46.687 --> 19:47.938
Okay.

19:48.021 --> 19:51.650
Come here. There's plenty of room.
It's a California king.

19:53.277 --> 19:54.987
-Come on.
-Get in here.

19:55.070 --> 19:57.322
-Get in here!
-Oh, my goodness,

19:57.406 --> 19:59.408
-there's so much tickling!
-(CELL PHONE VIBRATES)

19:59.491 --> 20:01.994
-And there's chin tickling and there's...
-Shit.

20:02.077 --> 20:03.787
What is it? What's the matter?

20:03.871 --> 20:05.706
Something tripped the security system
at the restaurant.

20:05.789 --> 20:09.334
That thing is so faulty,
I'd rather just get it replaced.

20:10.294 --> 20:11.879
You're leaving?

20:11.962 --> 20:14.047
Yeah, bud, but I'll be right back.

20:14.131 --> 20:16.091
(QUIETLY) Okay.

20:18.802 --> 20:20.095
I can go.

20:25.142 --> 20:27.728
-It's totally fine.
-Uh, are you sure?

20:27.811 --> 20:29.813
Yeah. Um...

20:31.565 --> 20:35.110
Absolutely. You... You stay here.

20:35.194 --> 20:37.487
I... I won't be gone very long.

20:37.571 --> 20:40.032

You know, I'll be about an hour.

20:40.115 --> 20:42.409

Ally, how are you?

23:33.121 --> 23:34.331
Tea?

23:34.957 --> 23:37.251
Sure. Just plain.

23:41.672 --> 23:43.966
Would you like a cup?

23:44.049 --> 23:48.762
Uh, no. I've got to pick some herbs
from the backyard for the restaurant.

23:48.846 --> 23:52.266

I was the one who reached out
when you missed your appointments.

24:17.416 --> 24:18.584
Thanks.

24:18.667 --> 24:20.836
Ivy told me about what happened.

in the restaurant last week.

It was Pedro Morales. (SNIFFLES)

Is there anything else
you want to tell me about him?

25:25.484 --> 25:27.444
He's not the killer.

25:27.528 --> 25:30.948
Mmm. Well, according to your wife,

25:31.031 --> 25:34.618
Mr. Morales pulled a knife on the victim
hours before he was murdered.

25:34.701 --> 25:36.119
(EXHALES)

25:36.203 --> 25:39.289
That is because Roger
threatened him first.

25:39.373 --> 25:41.041

25:41.124 --> 25:43.085

25:43.168 --> 25:45.504

25:45.587 --> 25:47.422
I've known Pedro since
we opened the restaurant.

25:47.506 --> 25:49.591
He didn't do this.

25:50.634 --> 25:54.513
What exactly is

26:17.828 --> 26:21.206
to what I instinctively knew was true.

26:42.186 --> 26:43.520
HARRISON: Yeah. It was a matter of time

26:43.604 --> 26:45.898
before he came after
our Second Amendment rights, so...

26:45.981 --> 26:49.610
I got one, and then it was
like potato chips, you know?

26:49.693 --> 26:50.694
I had to have another.

26:50.777 --> 26:52.738
I find it very phallic.

26:58.243 --> 27:00.078
You think I need a gun?

27:00.162 --> 27:02.664
It's the only thing
that's gonna make you feel safe again.

27:39.451 --> 27:40.702
Ally...

27:42.037 --> 27:43.497
I seriously think you should reconsider.

27:43.580 --> 27:45.707
Are you talking as my therapist,

27:45.791 --> 27:47.626
-or as a knee-jerk liberal?

27:55.008 --> 27:56.552
Okay.

27:56.635 --> 27:59.429
Then this is definitely something
you want to tell your wife about.

27:59.513 --> 28:01.640

28:01.723 --> 28:04.017
And you're not gonna tell her, either.

28:29.960 --> 28:31.461
Well, considering what she went through,

28:31.545 --> 28:35.424
I think fortifying the house
is in the realm of a normal reaction.

28:35.507 --> 28:37.426
It's proactive.

28:37.509 --> 28:39.678
Makes her feel like she's more in control.

28:39.761 --> 28:42.181
So, nothing to worry about?

28:43.265 --> 28:47.936

early signs of agoraphobia.

31:44.321 --> 31:46.281
I'm sorry, um...

31:46.365 --> 31:48.492
What does that have to do
with you running for city council?

31:48.575 --> 31:52.746
Did you know that you are 40% more likely
to be the victim of a violent crime

31:52.829 --> 31:54.706
committed at the hands
of an illegal immigrant,

31:54.790 --> 31:58.418
and that the murder and rape rates
are the highest they've ever been?

31:58.502 --> 32:01.839
That... That's not true.
Those numbers don't seem right to me.

a strong door like this?

Why would you need a knife
to answer the door?

32:49.595 --> 32:54.016
Are you gonna melt all this metal down
and build a bridge?

32:56.059 --> 32:58.395
I'm gonna need you to leave now.

32:58.478 --> 33:00.606

-No.

33:02.441 --> 33:03.734
No, you cannot.

33:03.817 --> 33:06.945
Can I use your phone?
My car broke down. Pretty please?

33:07.029 --> 33:09.281
I'm gonna need you to get off my property.

33:09.364 --> 33:11.867
Can I use your restroom?
Can't you see I'm an injured man?

a second mortgage on my house

33:39.811 --> 33:41.313
to place this order.

34:14.596 --> 34:17.474
I told her I'd do it.
She's checking the alarms.
