NARRATOR: <i>Previously on</i> Boston Legal...

00:02.377 --> 00:05.672
We routinely bring
the most ridiculous of lawsuits.

00:05.755 --> 00:09.551
Can't you just sort of seize the day?

00:09.634 --> 00:12.137
You need to start setting
your sights a little higher.

00:12.220 --> 00:15.098
That would make a lovely
Valentine's movie, but in the real world--

00:15.181 --> 00:17.642
In the real world,
love is the most inexplicable,

00:17.726 --> 00:19.853
unscientific, irrational of all phenomena.

00:19.936 --> 00:21.896
Preying on somebody with Alzheimer's--

00:21.980 --> 00:24.399
Obviously, I'm a little sensitive, given--

00:24.482 --> 00:25.358
Given what?

00:25.442 --> 00:27.694
I wish I could say
there's been improvement, but--

00:27.777 --> 00:29.821
Hey, Dad. It's Shirley.

00:39.205 --> 00:40.457
Excuse me. Uh...

00:40.540 --> 00:42.751
-Where is Walter Schmidt's room, please?
-Shirley?

00:43.501 --> 00:46.212
-What happened?
-He's okay. He broke a few ribs.

00:46.296 --> 00:48.256
-He's resting right now.
-What happened?

00:48.715 --> 00:50.300
He took a turn this week.

00:50.383 --> 00:53.219
He doesn't recognize any of us
at the nursing home anymore.

00:53.303 --> 00:56.473
He's been getting agitated.
Always seems to be terrified.

00:56.556 --> 00:57.599
How did he get hurt?

00:59.142 --> 01:00.977
He, uh, jumped out of his bedroom window.

01:01.811 --> 01:05.065
A hedge broke his fall
and probably saved his life.

01:07.734 --> 01:09.027
He jumped out the window?

01:09.486 --> 01:10.612
His dementia.

01:11.071 --> 01:13.198
I've gotta get back there.
He's not doing so well.

01:13.281 --> 01:15.158
-I'll join you.
-Oh, thanks. I'll be fine.

01:15.241 --> 01:17.702
Well, uh, maybe he'll recognize me.

01:17.786 --> 01:20.121
I always had a great relationship
with your father.

01:20.205 --> 01:23.458
We'd hunt. We'd fish.
Remember the time I shot him in the calf?

01:23.541 --> 01:25.627
(laughing) You're lucky
he doesn't remember.

01:25.710 --> 01:27.629
-I'd really rather go alone.
-I'd like to see him.

01:27.712 --> 01:29.964
-I was always very fond of your father.
-Really?

01:30.048 --> 01:32.675
-And he always liked me.
-Yes, he did.

01:33.885 --> 01:35.178
Okay, then. Let's go.

01:37.680 --> 01:39.224
-JERRY: Oh! (exhales)
-Jerry, What's wrong?

01:39.724 --> 01:41.851
-I'm in trouble.
-What sort of trouble?

01:41.935 --> 01:43.103
I can't tell you.

01:43.186 --> 01:45.396
-Why can't you tell me?
-You're a girl!

01:45.480 --> 01:47.524
It's man trouble?
Did you get a woman pregnant?

01:47.607 --> 01:49.484
-(grunting)
-Dear God!

01:49.567 --> 01:52.654
-It isn't that.
-Well, stop whinging and just tell me.

01:52.737 --> 01:54.072
(sighs)

01:58.284 --> 02:02.330
-Well, during the strike I fell in love.
-What strike?

02:02.413 --> 02:05.458
It doesn't matter. The point is,
I met somebody wonderful.

02:05.542 --> 02:10.255
-Fab. And?
-And she's suing me for sexual assault.

02:10.338 --> 02:12.090
-Sexual assault?
-(grunts)

02:12.173 --> 02:13.800
Stop squealing.
You sound like a stuck pig.

02:14.592 --> 02:16.636
What happened?
Did you touch her without her consent?

02:16.719 --> 02:19.472
No, I would never-- She's claiming I--

02:19.556 --> 02:22.976
She's saying I drugged her.

02:25.895 --> 02:27.147
Jerry?

02:28.439 --> 02:29.399
Did you?

02:34.320 --> 02:37.282
Well, maybe a little.

02:40.368 --> 02:43.329

03:09.606 --> 03:11.816
I'm hoping to make it to the island
on Memorial Day,

03:11.900 --> 03:13.568
if I can dig myself out of here.

03:13.651 --> 03:15.153
That would be great. We've missed you.

03:15.236 --> 03:16.779
-Oh. Please.
-Hm.

03:18.948 --> 03:21.492
So, what can I do for you?

03:21.576 --> 03:24.370
-Well, take a breath. Have a seat, Carl.
-All right.

03:24.454 --> 03:26.539
-'Cause this is a biggie.
-Mmm. Let me have it.

03:27.707 --> 03:29.167
We want to build an atomic bomb.

03:33.379 --> 03:34.547
What are you talking about?

03:34.631 --> 03:37.300
We wanna build a weapon
of mass destruction that we control.

03:39.052 --> 03:40.470
-By "we" you mean?
-Nantucket.

03:40.553 --> 03:43.473
I'm here officially as head
of the Board of Selectmen,

03:43.556 --> 03:45.308
and Liz is here as mayor.

03:45.391 --> 03:47.936
We're a very small island.
Totally exposed.

03:48.019 --> 03:50.939
The homeowners are becoming
increasingly concerned about security

03:51.022 --> 03:52.774
and, well, we're rich. We can afford it.

03:52.857 --> 03:53.816
We want one.

03:56.069 --> 04:00.323
An atomic bomb on Nantucket?

04:00.406 --> 04:02.825
We've been denied approval
to purchase plutonium

04:02.909 --> 04:04.661
by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.

04:04.744 --> 04:06.871
-Don't you hate that?
-We'd like to sue.

04:07.538 --> 04:10.291
(chuckles) Mmm.

04:11.251 --> 04:13.503
What kind of drugs are we
taking on the island these days?

04:13.586 --> 04:15.630
-Carl, I know it sounds crazy.
-Ya think?

04:15.713 --> 04:16.714
But if something ever happens,

04:16.798 --> 04:19.008
which the government says
is inevitable, by the way,

04:19.300 --> 04:21.427
who's going to come rushing to protect us?

04:21.803 --> 04:25.056
The Vineyard? No, no.
We need to look out for ourselves.

04:25.139 --> 04:28.393
And fortunately, we have the wealth
and the means to do so.

04:29.852 --> 04:32.605
You'd like an atomic bomb?

04:32.689 --> 04:34.399
As soon as possible.

04:48.663 --> 04:50.957
-Oxytocin?
-It's a hormone, not a drug.

04:51.040 --> 04:51.874
What does it do?

04:51.958 --> 04:55.920
Well, essentially,
it causes people to trust you.

04:56.004 --> 04:58.381
There's a hormone
that causes people to trust you?

04:59.340 --> 05:01.843
I mainly used it for me.

05:02.677 --> 05:05.138
It can also help people
with social anxieties.

05:05.221 --> 05:08.516
It enabled me to trust her, as well.

05:08.599 --> 05:12.103
I'd spray it on like cologne.

05:12.312 --> 05:14.689
It has a nice, gentle fragrance.
Not too bold.

05:17.066 --> 05:18.318
Anyway...

05:19.235 --> 05:21.362
Dana, that's her name.

05:22.113 --> 05:24.532
She found out, and she's suing me.

05:25.325 --> 05:26.284
(exhales)

05:28.328 --> 05:29.829
You're disappointed in me.

05:30.747 --> 05:33.416
Well, I am, Jerry, truth be told.

05:39.505 --> 05:41.007
(door opens)

05:49.390 --> 05:50.475
Dad?

05:51.642 --> 05:52.477
Hey, Dad.

05:54.020 --> 05:55.104
Who are you?

05:58.900 --> 06:01.319
Dad, it's-it's me. It's Shirley.

06:08.117 --> 06:09.243
You remember Denny?

06:10.953 --> 06:13.539
-Denny came to say hi.
-Hi, Walt.

06:15.333 --> 06:17.418
How are those, uh, ribs healing?

06:21.172 --> 06:22.215
Lookin' good, Walt.

06:26.928 --> 06:30.807
Ahh! (whimpering)

06:30.890 --> 06:32.725
He doesn't like to be touched.

06:33.810 --> 06:34.852
Where's the attending?

06:35.812 --> 06:36.854
I'll call for him.

06:37.313 --> 06:39.399
(Walt whimpering continues)

06:49.033 --> 06:52.203
-A nuclear bomb? On Nantucket?
-Are they insane?

06:52.286 --> 06:55.456
Poor people are insane, Whitney.
Rich people are colorful.

06:55.540 --> 06:57.792
Yes, well, assuming
the colorful people are sincere,

06:57.875 --> 06:59.794
how can you be about
to actually take the case?

06:59.877 --> 07:02.130
Well, first,
their security concerns are legitimate.

07:02.213 --> 07:04.924
Second, nuclear bombs
are becoming more and more viable.

07:05.007 --> 07:06.050
Easier to build.

07:06.134 --> 07:08.845
The world landscape, one day,
will be dotted with them.

07:08.928 --> 07:09.762
Why not Nantucket?

07:09.846 --> 07:11.681
And third, most importantly,

07:11.764 --> 07:14.809
when an island full of millionaires
asks us to represent them,

07:14.892 --> 07:17.353
Lorraine, we do not
refer them to another firm.

07:18.438 --> 07:22.608
I need you three to arm me
with research and legal analysis

07:22.692 --> 07:25.695
as to why Nantucket should have a bomb.

07:27.029 --> 07:28.656
-(knocks on door)
-(door opens)

07:29.615 --> 07:31.200
Hello. I'm Dr. Bromfield.

07:31.951 --> 07:32.952
(door closes)

07:33.578 --> 07:34.829
-Shirley Schmidt.
-Nice to meet you,

07:35.246 --> 07:37.623
though not under these circumstances.

07:38.708 --> 07:41.210
-Uh, this is Denny Crane.
-Hello.

07:42.003 --> 07:43.963
I wish I could tell you
something positive.

07:44.046 --> 07:46.132
I'm afraid the best we can do
is try and keep him calm.

07:47.091 --> 07:49.802
I don't dare move him. I'm concerned
that he'll reinjure his ribs.

07:51.095 --> 07:54.056
I would like to hook him up
to a morphine drip, please.

07:56.225 --> 07:59.395
His injuries are causing him
considerable pain.

07:59.479 --> 08:01.772
I'd like this done as soon as possible.

08:02.690 --> 08:03.524
I, um...

08:06.068 --> 08:08.613
-He-he seems to be comfortable now.
-SHIRLEY: He's not.

08:09.363 --> 08:10.740
I know him better than you.

08:11.616 --> 08:13.409
I'd like the drip, please.

08:14.577 --> 08:18.122
Ms. Schmidt, I can't do
what you're asking me to do.

08:19.749 --> 08:22.126
I'm asking you to manage his pain, doctor.

08:22.210 --> 08:23.252
I'm very sorry.

08:24.712 --> 08:26.631
I don't think a morphine drip
is indicated here.

08:26.714 --> 08:27.632
Ned Thiel...

08:29.550 --> 08:31.511
is he still chief of staff here?

08:32.178 --> 08:34.639
-He is.
-Get him.

08:35.765 --> 08:36.766
(mouths)

08:42.897 --> 08:46.234
Look, I know what you're asking for,
and I sympathize.

08:46.317 --> 08:49.737
My own father died of Alzheimer's.
You know this, Denny.

08:49.820 --> 08:51.072
But we have laws.

08:51.155 --> 08:53.241
This goes on all the time. You know that.

08:53.324 --> 08:55.826
Well, it happens sometimes with,
as I said,

08:55.910 --> 08:58.454
patients in severe physical pain.

08:58.996 --> 08:59.997
But look at him.

09:00.248 --> 09:02.291
How do we couch this as pain management?

09:02.375 --> 09:05.628
You simply believe me
when I tell you that he is hurting.

09:07.046 --> 09:08.756
Come on, Ned.
We're not asking for anything

09:08.839 --> 09:11.217
that doesn't happen
in every hospital every day.

09:11.676 --> 09:12.593
(sighs)

09:14.053 --> 09:15.263
I can't,

09:15.888 --> 09:18.641
but if you get a court order
forcing our hand,

09:19.725 --> 09:22.353
I suppose we'll have no choice
but to abide.

09:22.645 --> 09:26.274
-I'll argue it myself. Let's go.
-Thank you, Doctor.

09:28.317 --> 09:29.360
Denny.

09:29.819 --> 09:30.653
I...

09:31.779 --> 09:35.950
I-I think I would like Alan to argue this.

09:36.242 --> 09:37.952
It's-it's going to be tough,

09:38.035 --> 09:40.037
getting the judge off this dime,

09:40.121 --> 09:44.625
and I think this is sort of
Alan's wheelhouse.

09:48.379 --> 09:51.757
Okay. I guess that makes sense.

09:53.926 --> 09:55.136
Let's go get Alan.

10:06.314 --> 10:08.649
An atomic bomb in Nantucket?

10:08.733 --> 10:11.110
-Are you kidding me?
-I'm not, Your Honor.

10:11.193 --> 10:14.113
Nor is our president kidding
when he constantly tells us to be afraid.

10:14.196 --> 10:16.699
Nantucket is riddled
with Republicans, by the way.

10:16.782 --> 10:19.076
They believe our commander in chief
when he cries wolf.

10:19.160 --> 10:21.203
They believe John McCain
as he cries double wolf.

10:21.287 --> 10:22.830
Some even believe Cheney when he says

10:22.913 --> 10:25.625
the bomb's already been fired at us,
it's just on a timer.

10:26.417 --> 10:28.836
-The court dismisses--
-Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa.

10:31.339 --> 10:35.176
Your Honor, as ridiculous
as this may seem on its face,

10:35.259 --> 10:37.345
let's consider, Your Honor.

10:37.428 --> 10:40.431
Nantucket is all by itself out there.

10:40.514 --> 10:43.684
It wouldn't be a high priority to defend,
should this country be under attack.

10:43.768 --> 10:46.479
Shouldn't they be allowed
to defend themselves?

10:46.854 --> 10:49.148
I would ask you at least
listen to my client

10:49.231 --> 10:50.900
before quashing our request.

10:56.614 --> 10:58.783
I'll give your client 15 minutes.

10:59.450 --> 11:00.493
Three o'clock.

11:01.327 --> 11:03.788
-What are you lookin' at?
-(gavel bangs)

11:06.791 --> 11:09.752
I don't mean to sound indelicate,
but how far gone is he?

11:10.586 --> 11:13.381
Very. He's been virtually

11:13.464 --> 11:17.009
uncommunicative for a while, but now he...

11:17.760 --> 11:20.554
doesn't recognize anyone, including me.

11:21.681 --> 11:25.768
This man who was once
bigger than life, a maverick.

11:27.853 --> 11:28.729
It's obscene.

11:34.360 --> 11:37.154
-Did he execute a living will?
-He did.

11:37.863 --> 11:40.700
No extraordinary
lifesaving measures, but...

11:42.952 --> 11:45.538
We'll be asking a court's permission
to put him to sleep.

11:47.248 --> 11:48.582
Yes.

11:49.083 --> 11:49.917
(clicks tongue)

11:53.045 --> 11:54.797
The proceeding will be rough, Shirley.

11:58.092 --> 11:59.635
Let's try to get this done.

12:02.847 --> 12:05.015
-She's coming by herself or--
-No, with a lawyer.

12:05.391 --> 12:07.309
Let's not let this turn emotional, Jerry.

12:07.393 --> 12:10.187
I prefer to be straightforward
and proffer strictly legal analysis.

12:10.271 --> 12:12.189
-Okay.
-Purring, popping, squealing

12:12.273 --> 12:15.693
-should all be kept to a minimum.
-Mm. There she is.

12:24.535 --> 12:26.871
-Jerry.
-Hello. Hello. Welcome.

12:27.246 --> 12:28.581
-Hello.
-Hi.

12:28.998 --> 12:32.084
I'm Pepper Minkin,
Miss Dana Strickland's attorney.

12:32.168 --> 12:35.129
-Katie Lloyd. Pleasure. Hello.
-Hello.

12:38.007 --> 12:39.049
Well, why don't we go in?

12:40.342 --> 12:42.678
-Would either of you like coffee?
-DANA: I'm fine, thanks.

12:42.762 --> 12:45.097
I'm good. Coffee makes the ticker race.

12:45.181 --> 12:46.557
-Oh.
-(chuckles)

12:47.725 --> 12:50.728
-Jerry, she's positively stunning.
-I know.

12:50.811 --> 12:53.105
-How much oxytocin did you use?
-(stomps)

12:53.189 --> 12:55.065
-I didn't mean it like that.
-Yes, you did. (stomps)

12:55.149 --> 12:57.318
MAN (on TV): <i>The island of Nantucket</i>
<i>is going to court today</i>

12:57.401 --> 13:01.238
<i>to actually seek legal permission</i>
<i>to build an atomic bomb</i>

13:01.322 --> 13:02.990
<i>as part of its defense system.</i>

13:03.073 --> 13:05.910
<i>Nantucket, of course, being one</i>
<i>of the richest towns in America--</i>

13:06.202 --> 13:07.787
<i>...back in court at 3:00 today.</i>

13:07.870 --> 13:10.956
<i>Nobody, of course,</i>
<i>expects this request to be granted,</i>

13:11.040 --> 13:12.583
<i>but stranger things have happened.</i>

13:13.083 --> 13:15.085
Did I mention that this case
might get a little press?

13:15.169 --> 13:17.880
Carl, I'm begging you. Let me in on this.

13:17.963 --> 13:21.008
Ah, well, Denny, as you can see,
we're already a little thick with lawyers.

13:21.091 --> 13:23.093
All my life I'd hoped
that somehow, someday,

13:23.177 --> 13:25.763
I'd be called upon
to help build a nuclear bomb.

13:25.846 --> 13:28.766
Could there be anything more American than
to be part of blowing up another country?

13:28.849 --> 13:31.644
-I got chills.
-Huh. Uh--

13:31.727 --> 13:33.270
Denny can take my place.

13:34.188 --> 13:35.731
With all due respect,
I don't want to be a part of this.

13:36.148 --> 13:37.733
I think this case is reprehensible.

13:37.983 --> 13:41.362
I'm sure Texas would love to have
its own bomb, maybe Alabama too.

13:41.904 --> 13:43.030
Have you given any thought...

13:44.907 --> 13:46.158
What if we should win this case?

13:46.826 --> 13:48.953
-We won't.
-And that makes it okay?

13:49.703 --> 13:51.580
Take a despicable cause
for a pile of money

13:51.664 --> 13:53.415
because you know you won't win.

13:53.499 --> 13:55.709
What a girl. No wonder he wears dresses.

13:56.752 --> 13:58.170
I'm not doing this case.

14:01.298 --> 14:03.759
Girl. I'm in.

14:08.222 --> 14:10.349
He doesn't want to live like this.

14:10.432 --> 14:13.727
His mind is rotting away.
Much of it's already gone.

14:14.186 --> 14:16.856
His organs are shutting down.
He's incontinent.

14:18.023 --> 14:20.734
The indignity is beyond words.

14:20.818 --> 14:24.822
When your father was competent,
did you two ever discuss...

14:25.364 --> 14:27.825
We did. He signed a living will.

14:27.908 --> 14:31.620
He did not want to be kept alive
by extraordinary means.

14:31.704 --> 14:35.583
But we're not talking about keeping him
alive with any extraordinary means.

14:36.166 --> 14:39.211
You're here asking
for permission to euthanize him.

14:39.295 --> 14:41.297
My father is in extreme discomfort.

14:41.380 --> 14:44.675
I'm asking to manage his pain
with morphine.

14:44.758 --> 14:47.052
Yes. You have to couch it
in those terms to get the court order,

14:47.136 --> 14:50.890
but, Miss Schmidt, you're not denying
what this is really about.

14:50.973 --> 14:53.642
-Are you?
-Are you denying this happens all the time

14:53.726 --> 14:55.394
under the heading of pain management?

14:55.936 --> 14:58.272
When there is actual pain to manage,

14:58.355 --> 15:02.693
but here, your father isn't in
any real physical discomfiture.

15:02.776 --> 15:05.696
He's-he's probably not even aware
of his mental state.

15:06.530 --> 15:09.533
The pain we're talking about
managing here is yours.

15:11.452 --> 15:15.664
First of all, my father
suffered some broken ribs. He is in pain.

15:15.748 --> 15:21.170
Second, the agitation he experiences,
the fear, the anxiety,

15:21.253 --> 15:23.923
are an extreme form of discomfiture,
Mr. Hollis.

15:24.006 --> 15:27.134
Please do not suggest to me
that he does not anguish.

15:36.226 --> 15:38.938
The fact of the matter is, is we
can manage his pain quite effectively

15:39.021 --> 15:41.315
without morphine,
and we are, with codeine.

15:41.982 --> 15:42.983
The other fact...

15:45.778 --> 15:46.820
Is what, sir?

15:46.904 --> 15:50.407
Well, the pain we're talking about
is from injuries that will heal.

15:50.908 --> 15:53.994
In cases where morphine drips
have been turned up with fatal results,

15:54.078 --> 15:56.622
it's irreversible pain, which--

15:56.705 --> 15:58.666
I certainly sympathize
with the family's position.

15:58.749 --> 16:01.335
If it were my father, I would probably
want to do the same thing.

16:01.919 --> 16:03.963
But the law simply doesn't allow it.

16:04.713 --> 16:07.091
I read an article
that said people in comas

16:07.174 --> 16:09.468
can actually experience physical pain.

16:09.551 --> 16:11.804
-Is that true?
-Yes.

16:11.887 --> 16:14.431
Do you think it's possible
that a conscious person

16:14.515 --> 16:16.517
could be experiencing pain,

16:16.892 --> 16:19.561
but because of his advanced
mental deterioration,

16:19.645 --> 16:22.272
that he'd be incapable
of communicating that pain?

16:22.815 --> 16:24.066
I suppose it's possible.

16:24.149 --> 16:27.611
So if a doctor, say,
wanted to make such a finding,

16:27.695 --> 16:30.072
let's say the patient
was his own father, say,

16:30.155 --> 16:33.575
he might be able to find pain,
prescribe the morphine,

16:33.659 --> 16:38.247
and nobody could state to a reasonable
medical certainty that he was wrong.

16:39.498 --> 16:42.376
I'd like to think that my medical ethics
would prevent me from doing that.

16:42.459 --> 16:46.088
I see. So in your opinion,
the medically ethical thing to do here

16:46.171 --> 16:50.509
is let this person's brain continue to rot
until all his vital organs shut down,

16:50.592 --> 16:52.928
he shrinks to 85 pounds,
his esophagus closes up

16:53.012 --> 16:56.098
so he can no longer eat, and he begins
to suffer grand mal seizures.

16:56.181 --> 16:59.476
These are the ethics
you bring to this courtroom today?

17:11.196 --> 17:12.448
It's a sad day indeed

17:12.531 --> 17:14.867
when the science of love
is chemically manipulated.

17:14.950 --> 17:17.619
Men ply women
with a little wine on occasions.

17:17.703 --> 17:20.748
Women have been known
to throw on intoxicating perfumes.

17:20.831 --> 17:22.958
My client spritzed himself
with a little cologne.

17:23.042 --> 17:25.127
Laced with a hormone, Miss Lloyd,

17:25.210 --> 17:28.505
one naturally released
in the body during orgasm.

17:28.589 --> 17:31.091
It influences one's ability to bond.

17:31.592 --> 17:33.635
Doctors call it "the nesting hormone."

17:33.719 --> 17:35.763
It's a far cry from perfume.

17:35.846 --> 17:39.391
But as I understand my client,
he used it as much to relax himself--

17:39.475 --> 17:40.642
That doesn't make it right.

17:40.726 --> 17:42.895
Jerry never meant to victimize her.

17:42.978 --> 17:44.480
-May I respond?
-Certainly.

17:45.189 --> 17:46.065
(exhales)

17:47.941 --> 17:50.110
I regarded you as profoundly honest,

17:50.986 --> 17:55.199
and to discover that you were deceitful
in the most personal of ways...

17:57.910 --> 18:01.580
It's not simply that I don't trust you
any longer, Jerry.

18:02.706 --> 18:04.500
How am I supposed to trust myself?

18:06.585 --> 18:07.961
To bond with anybody?

18:20.766 --> 18:22.142
Mr. Engels, how are you employed?

18:22.851 --> 18:25.854
Uh, I was hired as a physicist
by the town of Nantucket.

18:25.938 --> 18:26.939
Hired for what?

18:27.022 --> 18:28.732
To design an atomic bomb for them.

18:29.024 --> 18:30.609
LORRAINE:
And are you capable of doing that?

18:30.692 --> 18:31.610
Quite.

18:31.693 --> 18:34.154
Would you describe generally
how one makes them?

18:34.238 --> 18:37.199
Uh, yes. Well, you have
your fissionable material, say, plutonium,

18:37.282 --> 18:40.035
in the middle,
encapsulated in a metallic sphere,

18:40.119 --> 18:42.663
lined with beryllium,
which promotes the fission process.

18:42.746 --> 18:45.457
Outside that
are shaped charges of dynamite.

18:45.541 --> 18:48.627
Now, when the dynamite explodes,
the plutonium is compressed.

18:48.710 --> 18:52.172
It reaches critical mass,
it fissions and-- Boom!

18:52.256 --> 18:54.133
-(all gasping)
-Sorry. (chuckles)

18:54.216 --> 18:57.344
I always get a kick out of doing that.
(clears throat)

18:57.427 --> 19:00.180
Um, I guess the question is,
what's to stop anybody

19:00.264 --> 19:02.141
from having a bomb if it's this simple?

19:02.224 --> 19:06.145
Uh, well, money. The real difficulty
is in obtaining the fissionable material,

19:06.228 --> 19:08.021
say, plutonium or enriched uranium.

19:08.105 --> 19:10.065
But once you have that, the rest is easy.

19:10.149 --> 19:12.526
And this bomb would actually be viable?

19:12.609 --> 19:14.069
(chuckling) Oh, yeah. Yes.

19:15.112 --> 19:17.239
You see, the thing about
the nuclear bomb, Your Honor,

19:17.322 --> 19:18.740
is that it doesn't
have to be made perfect.

19:18.824 --> 19:22.369
Um, the one they dropped on Hiroshima
had 60 kilos of enriched uranium in it,

19:22.452 --> 19:24.997
and only about one percent of that
actually fissioned.

19:25.080 --> 19:26.707
So over 90 percent of that bomb was a dud?

19:26.790 --> 19:27.624
Yes.

19:28.125 --> 19:30.252
But, I mean, as far as duds go--

19:30.335 --> 19:31.962
Boom! Sorry.

19:32.045 --> 19:33.589
(upbeat music playing)

19:33.672 --> 19:38.177

<i>and boom, Paris ♪</i>

19:38.260 --> 19:42.639

20:03.493 --> 20:05.704
So, Bill, what's going on?

20:06.705 --> 20:08.040
-What do you mean?
-What I mean is,

20:08.123 --> 20:09.208
this is a ridiculous case.

20:09.291 --> 20:11.084
I've never known you
to be a ridiculous man,

20:11.168 --> 20:13.670
so why don't you tell me
what you're up to?

20:14.630 --> 20:16.673
Do you realize what a target Nantucket is?

20:17.674 --> 20:19.635
When you think of the iconic staples
of America

20:19.718 --> 20:23.639
that the world so hates: rich people,
Wall Street gluttons, evil politicians,

20:23.722 --> 20:27.142
Hollywood producers,
they all have homes on Nantucket.

20:27.226 --> 20:30.771
-It's one-stop shopping.
-Bill, what are you up to?

20:33.148 --> 20:36.443
(exhales) Look, I know
this lawsuit is absurd.

20:36.526 --> 20:39.154
-Now, we can't possibly win it.
-But?

20:40.030 --> 20:42.449
But we have a presidential election
coming up,

20:42.532 --> 20:44.910
and all we hear about
is the war, the economy,

20:44.993 --> 20:47.371
the mortgage crisis, the recession.

20:47.454 --> 20:50.123
Nuclear proliferation has been
pushed right off the table.

20:50.207 --> 20:51.917
None of the candidates
are talking about it.

20:52.000 --> 20:53.252
Nuclear proliferation?

20:53.335 --> 20:55.879
Do you realize Bush
tore up the arms treaty?

20:55.963 --> 20:58.507
We offered to sell nuclear technology
to civilians in India.

20:58.590 --> 21:00.509
Civilians, for God sakes!

21:00.592 --> 21:03.845
-And nobody's even discussing this.
-So this lawsuit--

21:03.929 --> 21:05.806
It's a way to put the topic
back on the table.

21:06.223 --> 21:09.434
It's not just terrorists we need to fear,
Carl, it's countries, too.

21:10.060 --> 21:12.062
So, yeah. You go get 'em, Counselor.

21:13.563 --> 21:15.190
Go get me my bomb.

21:31.665 --> 21:33.500
-Hey.
-Hey.

21:36.378 --> 21:39.214
So, how was your day?

21:40.299 --> 21:42.009
Oh, same old.

21:42.426 --> 21:44.511
Went to court, trying to kill my father.
You?

21:45.304 --> 21:46.680
Trying to get Nantucket a bomb.

21:47.639 --> 21:50.058
-Are we stuck in a rut?
-(chuckles)

21:52.269 --> 21:54.730
-Is there anything I can do?
-It's funny.

21:55.647 --> 21:57.566
You turn on TV and see...

21:59.192 --> 22:03.530
advertisement after advertisement
about how to have a better life.

22:06.950 --> 22:09.328
Why can't we help people
to have a better death?

22:09.411 --> 22:13.290
Shirley, you and I know the only thing
more powerful than the religious right,

22:13.373 --> 22:16.335
or, well, God, in this country,

22:17.461 --> 22:18.920
pharmaceutical companies.

22:20.005 --> 22:22.257
The best chance
at physician-assisted suicide

22:22.341 --> 22:26.053
is for some big drug company
to invent the euthanasia pill.

22:26.136 --> 22:29.264
They'll lobby Congress. Psst. Done deal.

22:31.892 --> 22:32.851
I miss you.

22:35.228 --> 22:36.146
I miss you, too.

22:38.565 --> 22:39.524
Should we get back together?

22:40.942 --> 22:43.070
At least until, you know, Dad's dead?

22:44.154 --> 22:46.907
-I could help you through the rough times.
-(soft chuckle)

22:47.616 --> 22:51.078
I don't know any man
who is more adorable with his cynicism.

22:53.580 --> 22:56.083
Anything you need, I'm here.

22:57.459 --> 22:58.377
Thank you, Carl.

23:01.088 --> 23:04.758
I think, for now,
what I need is just to sit here alone.

23:12.432 --> 23:13.517
(sighs)

23:30.367 --> 23:31.952
You just flat-out refused

23:32.035 --> 23:33.829
-to work on the case?
-Yes.

23:33.912 --> 23:36.039
-And he didn't fire you?
-He likes me.

23:36.623 --> 23:37.624
Whenever I'm around him

23:37.707 --> 23:40.001
I slap on a little oxytocin,
and he's like putty.

23:40.085 --> 23:42.671
Oh, very funny.
You slap on a dress while you're at it?

23:42.754 --> 23:44.464
-Sing him a song? Poop-head!
-Jerry?

23:44.548 --> 23:46.466
Oh, what? Sorry.

23:48.593 --> 23:51.221
Listen. I've read up on the science
of this hormone.

23:51.721 --> 23:53.598
While there's no evidence
it can make one fall in love,

23:53.682 --> 23:55.392
it evidently can facilitate bonding.

23:55.475 --> 23:58.520
Some therapists actually prescribe it
for relationship maintenance.

23:58.603 --> 23:59.438
Bottom line,

23:59.521 --> 24:01.398
she very much does have a case,
I'm sorry to say.

24:02.190 --> 24:05.152
If this case is to go away,
I think you'll have to accomplish it.

24:05.235 --> 24:07.988
You need to talk directly to her
and hope she's persuaded.

24:09.072 --> 24:11.491
-Okay.
-I've set up another meeting for 3:00.

24:11.575 --> 24:15.328
Be candid. Speak from the heart, humbly.
Do not snivel.

24:15.412 --> 24:16.830
And no matter what happens,

24:16.913 --> 24:20.375
you must refrain from calling her
a poop-head. Can you manage that?

24:22.544 --> 24:25.589
ALAN: This is not a new debate,
but the fact that we still continue

24:25.672 --> 24:29.050
to have the debate
in this country baffles me.

24:29.134 --> 24:32.304
People are helped to die every single day

24:32.387 --> 24:35.724
in virtually every hospital,
in hospices, at home,

24:35.807 --> 24:38.518
all under the wink-wink
of pain management.

24:38.602 --> 24:42.606
And yet every time someone suggests
bringing this practice out of the closet,

24:42.689 --> 24:46.193
opponents leap up screaming
there's potential for abuse,

24:46.276 --> 24:49.488
we'll end up killing people
who want to live. Come on.

24:49.571 --> 24:52.324
If there's potential for abuse,
then by all means, let's regulate it.

24:52.407 --> 24:55.619
Have an administrative hearing
or go to court, like we're doing now.

24:55.702 --> 24:58.205
But there's much more potential for abuse
when we do it secretly.

24:58.288 --> 25:00.916
No, no, no.
There is a good reason for the secrecy.

25:00.999 --> 25:04.878
The last thing we want to do
is to cultivate a culture of suicide.

25:04.961 --> 25:07.339
-Oh--
-Almost 20 percent of today's teenagers

25:07.422 --> 25:10.050
contemplate taking their own lives
at one time or another.

25:10.133 --> 25:12.219
A recent five-year analysis showed

25:12.302 --> 25:15.597
a 20 percent rise in suicides
among middle-aged people.

25:15.680 --> 25:18.683
It's becoming epidemic.
Not the time to lift the stigma.

25:18.767 --> 25:22.103
-We would not be sending the message--
-Oh, yes, we would, Mr. Shore.

25:22.187 --> 25:25.524
You make it permissible, that's one step
closer to making it acceptable.

25:25.607 --> 25:27.859
And the real danger
is that elderly parents start thinking

25:27.943 --> 25:30.320
it's maybe their duty
to spare their children

25:30.403 --> 25:32.948
-so they won't drain their finances.
-This would not be that case.

25:33.031 --> 25:34.032
Could be tomorrow's case.

25:34.115 --> 25:36.201
Which is why we take it
on a case-by-case basis,

25:36.284 --> 25:38.745
addressing all the concerns you raise.

25:38.828 --> 25:42.290
But why must we have
an absolute blanket ban

25:42.374 --> 25:46.586
when it causes such immeasurable
suffering for so many?

25:46.670 --> 25:49.798
Because it's not potential for abuse
that's really in play, Counsel.

25:49.881 --> 25:51.883
Let's all admit that. It's politics.

25:51.967 --> 25:55.637
And the legislature gets to make the laws,
not the judges.

25:55.720 --> 25:58.223
But it's for the judges
to safeguard the Constitution.

25:58.306 --> 26:01.518
Included therein
is our fundamental right to privacy.

26:01.601 --> 26:04.813
Can there be anything
more private, more personal,

26:04.896 --> 26:08.108
than the destiny
of one's own body, one's life?

26:08.191 --> 26:12.195
It's also for the judges
to step in and be humane

26:12.279 --> 26:15.699
when a gutless, politically expedient
Congress refuses to do so.

26:16.157 --> 26:19.202
My God. We put dogs to sleep,

26:19.286 --> 26:20.579
to spare their needless suffering.

26:20.662 --> 26:23.873
Why don't we extend the same compassion
to human beings?

26:23.957 --> 26:26.543
This man is terminal. He will die.

26:26.626 --> 26:29.879
He fears people, all people.
He can't control his bowels.

26:29.963 --> 26:32.215
He has an utter lack of cognizance,

26:32.299 --> 26:36.052
and an inability to have any meaningful
exchange, or even contact.

26:36.136 --> 26:38.638
Would you choose to live like that?
Would anybody?

26:38.722 --> 26:42.058
To allow assisted suicide
is to say that life itself

26:42.142 --> 26:44.394
has no intrinsic value, no sanctity.

26:44.477 --> 26:47.355
Oh, baloney.
I'm saying Walter Schmidt's life,

26:47.439 --> 26:50.025
in its current state,
has no intrinsic value.

26:50.108 --> 26:51.860
He lies in his bed

26:51.943 --> 26:55.113
with no apparent capacity
to discern or think.

26:55.196 --> 26:58.116
His days have devolved
into a horrible cycle

26:58.199 --> 27:01.536
of soiling his bed sheets
and screaming incoherently

27:01.620 --> 27:03.747
at the very touch of the nurse
who cleans him.

27:03.830 --> 27:06.333
His life is a misery. I'm sorry.

27:06.416 --> 27:07.709
There is no sanctity in that.

27:07.792 --> 27:08.877
I don't care what...

27:18.678 --> 27:19.763
(chuckles)

27:21.264 --> 27:22.265
I'm sorry.

27:27.437 --> 27:29.773
My, uh, best friend has Alzheimer's,

27:30.690 --> 27:33.068
in the very early stages. It hasn't...

27:36.112 --> 27:41.159
He is a grand lover of life,
and will be for some time.

27:41.242 --> 27:45.330
I believe, even when his mind
starts to really go,

27:45.413 --> 27:49.793
he'll still fish, he'll laugh and love.

27:51.169 --> 27:54.047
And as it progresses,
he'll still want to live,

27:54.130 --> 27:59.844
because there'll be value for him
in a friendship, in a cigar.

28:03.556 --> 28:06.017
The truth is, I don't think
he'll ever come to me

28:06.101 --> 28:09.270
and say, "This is the day I want to die."

28:09.354 --> 28:13.233
But the day is coming,
and he won't know it.

28:18.071 --> 28:19.447
This is perhaps the...

28:21.324 --> 28:24.285
The most insidious thing
about Alzheimer's. It...

28:25.829 --> 28:31.501
But you see, he trusts me to know
when that day has arrived.

28:31.584 --> 28:35.797
He trusts me to safeguard his dignity,

28:35.880 --> 28:39.467
his legacy and self-respect.

28:40.427 --> 28:46.224
He trusts me to prevent his end
from becoming a mindless piece of mush.

28:46.891 --> 28:47.767
And I will.

28:49.436 --> 28:53.273
It will be an unbearably painful...

28:57.777 --> 29:00.071
thing for me,

29:00.822 --> 29:03.616
but I will do it because I love him.

29:03.700 --> 29:07.162
I will end his suffering
because it's the only decent,

29:07.245 --> 29:11.040
humane and loving thing a person can do.

29:18.256 --> 29:22.051
Ms. Schmidt is here today
because she loves her father.

29:23.011 --> 29:26.598
She's asking you to show mercy

29:26.681 --> 29:29.392
that the law refuses to.

29:30.101 --> 29:32.645
She is asking you to play God.

29:32.729 --> 29:35.648
Your Honor, whatever one's belief in God,

29:35.732 --> 29:37.859
I know we can all agree,

29:37.942 --> 29:41.279
some lives are taken
far too early, and others...

29:43.198 --> 29:44.240
far too late.

30:07.388 --> 30:09.182
JUDGE: I really don't like playing God.

30:09.641 --> 30:11.768
I do believe in God, by the way.

30:12.101 --> 30:15.313
I believe there's a sanctity
to every human life.

30:15.772 --> 30:18.650
The idea that doctors and relatives

30:18.733 --> 30:22.028
get to start weighing the quality
of a given life to decide

30:22.111 --> 30:23.988
who shall live, who shall die,

30:25.114 --> 30:26.366
it horrifies me.

30:26.991 --> 30:31.079
And I see tremendous potential for abuse.

30:32.956 --> 30:35.834
But there is no suggestion
of such abuse here.

30:36.709 --> 30:38.336
Mr. Schmidt is terminal.

30:38.419 --> 30:41.422
His condition is irreversible.
He is suffering.

30:42.632 --> 30:45.802
The law allows patients
to refuse medical treatment,

30:45.885 --> 30:47.846
even when to do so means death.

30:48.263 --> 30:51.933
It allows the disconnection of nutrition
and hydration tubes,

30:52.016 --> 30:54.811
thereby basically starving
the person to death.

30:56.646 --> 31:02.527
What rational distinction can there be
for not allowing a more humane method?

31:04.904 --> 31:07.323
Plaintiff's motion is granted.

31:09.576 --> 31:12.662
Ms. Schmidt, my prayers are with you.

31:13.621 --> 31:15.540
-(mouths)
-Adjourned.

31:31.431 --> 31:32.515
First, let me say,

31:33.349 --> 31:36.519
I have thought deeply about my actions,

31:36.603 --> 31:39.814
for which, I conclude, I have no excuse.

31:39.898 --> 31:42.108
Accordingly,
I will not seek to proffer any.

31:43.151 --> 31:44.068
However...

31:46.404 --> 31:49.532
The thing about love, sweetheart, is--
Come on, we all throw up fronts and--

31:57.957 --> 31:59.125
The thing about love is

32:00.293 --> 32:04.380
people often try to remake themselves
in their lover's eyes,

32:04.464 --> 32:06.633
especially in new relationships.

32:07.717 --> 32:10.136
We want to present

32:10.762 --> 32:13.222
the most flattering version of ourselves.

32:13.723 --> 32:16.142
We want to seem smarter, funnier.

32:16.559 --> 32:19.687
We pretend to be something we're not.

32:21.773 --> 32:22.649
I...

32:24.359 --> 32:26.402
I wanted you to think

32:26.486 --> 32:30.573
I was more confident than I am.

32:31.074 --> 32:34.494
I wanted you to feel safer with me
than women typically feel.

32:34.577 --> 32:36.537
I wanted to have an edge,

32:37.330 --> 32:40.166
which, clearly, I do not enjoy.

32:45.505 --> 32:47.256
You are a beautiful woman.

32:50.301 --> 32:55.473
I am an odd man who stutters, purrs, coos,

32:55.556 --> 32:56.432
squeaks...

32:57.976 --> 33:00.478
with all the self-confidence of a mayfly.

33:02.939 --> 33:05.441
But like it or not, babe,
this is what you get--

33:09.404 --> 33:10.947
All of this is to say...

33:13.199 --> 33:16.869
I did a remarkably stupid,

33:17.370 --> 33:18.871
unforgivable thing

33:20.123 --> 33:22.208
because I have fallen in love with you,

33:23.376 --> 33:26.713
and I am desperate for you
to fall in love with me.

33:32.343 --> 33:34.762
Your Honor, we're trying to build a world

33:34.846 --> 33:37.682
where we have fewer weapons,
as opposed to more.

33:37.765 --> 33:40.059
No, that's simply not true.
Bush tore up the arms control treaties.

33:40.143 --> 33:42.520
I'm not gonna get into
a foreign policy debate.

33:42.603 --> 33:46.065
Suffice it to say that nuclear bombs
belong in the hands of stable,

33:46.149 --> 33:47.567
-sovereign--
-Stable?

33:48.026 --> 33:51.154
Iran may have a bomb, for God sakes.
North Korea has one.

33:51.237 --> 33:53.573
It is the United States government's job

33:53.656 --> 33:56.159
to protect us,
not some tony resort island.

33:56.242 --> 33:58.119
CARL: Our federal government is broken.

33:58.202 --> 34:00.455
We have illegal aliens
streaming across the border.

34:00.538 --> 34:03.249
Our military is bogged down in Iraq,
maybe for 100 years,

34:03.332 --> 34:06.085
if the Supreme Court
gets to pick our president again.

34:06.169 --> 34:07.670
The National Guard is depleted.

34:07.754 --> 34:11.132
We can't protect a levee in New Orleans
against a hurricane.

34:11.215 --> 34:13.843
And come on, everybody has a bomb.

34:13.926 --> 34:16.971
France, China, Russia, (whispers) Israel.

34:17.346 --> 34:20.808
Maybe Iran, with that whack job
"I'm in a dinner jacket."

34:20.892 --> 34:22.018
Why not Nantucket?

34:22.101 --> 34:24.771
They're far more reasonable,
more stable, and hey,

34:24.854 --> 34:26.606
how about this? They're on our side.

34:26.689 --> 34:27.899
Why can't they have a bomb?

34:27.982 --> 34:29.442
Okay, I've heard enough.

34:29.901 --> 34:33.571
Mr. Sack, you can't expect me
to grant your request here.

34:33.821 --> 34:34.697
Sure I can. Watch.

34:38.701 --> 34:42.205
I had my clerk do a little research.
It wasn't pretty.

34:42.288 --> 34:46.834
You're right. Our current president
tore up the arms control treaties.

34:46.918 --> 34:49.837
A lot of countries seem
to be getting the bomb now.

34:50.254 --> 34:55.301
And you left out Pakistan,
which is perhaps the scariest of all.

34:55.843 --> 34:57.553
They might be on our side today,

34:57.637 --> 35:01.265
but it's not a stretch
to see Islamic extremists

35:01.349 --> 35:03.267
taking over there, and then what?

35:03.559 --> 35:06.312
Their nuclear arsenal is massive.

35:06.395 --> 35:09.273
This in the country
where Bin Laden may be hiding.

35:09.357 --> 35:10.983
And we're supposed to feel safe

35:11.067 --> 35:13.152
with whatever rogue government
is in place?

35:13.236 --> 35:14.654
My God.

35:15.363 --> 35:16.239
(judge exhales)

35:17.073 --> 35:18.741
I don't have the answer.

35:20.201 --> 35:23.454
But in my gut, I simply cannot believe

35:23.538 --> 35:27.917
it lies in giving
an atomic bomb to Nantucket.

35:28.000 --> 35:29.043
(upbeat music playing)

35:29.127 --> 35:32.922
Plaintiff's motion is denied.
We're adjourned.

36:00.032 --> 36:01.159
I'm here.

36:03.286 --> 36:04.787
Dana, I...

36:07.123 --> 36:09.709
I don't know how else
to convey how sorry I am--

36:09.792 --> 36:10.877
Jerry.

36:12.670 --> 36:13.629
I'm sorry as well.

36:16.299 --> 36:18.593
As hurt and as betrayed as I felt...

36:19.844 --> 36:22.889
Suing you? That was wrong.

36:24.056 --> 36:26.184
I believe you are the man
I thought you were...

36:27.435 --> 36:28.394
just...

36:30.146 --> 36:33.649
Well, maybe a little more vulnerable
than I realized.

36:38.738 --> 36:39.739
Is there...

36:41.490 --> 36:45.453
-Do we have a chance of getting back?
-I would like that.

36:45.745 --> 36:47.705
Actually, I'd really like that.

36:57.006 --> 36:58.132
(chuckles)

37:07.266 --> 37:08.517
(door opens)

37:19.153 --> 37:20.029
ALAN: How's he doing?

37:20.905 --> 37:23.449
He started the drip three hours ago.

37:26.577 --> 37:30.831
His breath has slowed almost to...

37:31.749 --> 37:32.792
(sighs)

37:36.379 --> 37:38.881
He was quite a man.

37:43.761 --> 37:45.846
Strong, freewheeling.

37:47.098 --> 37:48.432
A lawyer's lawyer.

37:49.600 --> 37:50.935
And a daughter's father.

37:57.650 --> 38:01.112
I've known this day
was coming for some time. I...

38:02.405 --> 38:05.574
I even prayed for it,
knowing it would be a blessing, but...

38:06.826 --> 38:07.868
(exhales)

38:08.703 --> 38:09.662
No matter.

38:13.624 --> 38:14.542
I don't...

38:16.252 --> 38:17.295
(sighs)

38:17.378 --> 38:22.133
I don't think anyone's ever prepared
for a parent to die,

38:24.176 --> 38:25.636
no matter what you think.

38:30.308 --> 38:31.225
Yes.

38:31.726 --> 38:32.852
Alan, thank you.

38:37.315 --> 38:38.274
(exhales)

38:39.900 --> 38:41.527
With all of your nonsense, I...

38:44.113 --> 38:47.116
I fully expect to have to
fire you one day.

38:49.618 --> 38:51.912
I just want you to know,
when that day comes,

38:53.039 --> 38:54.832
it'll be harder for me.

38:57.168 --> 38:58.002
Yup.

38:58.419 --> 38:59.837
(monitor beeping rapidly)

39:03.049 --> 39:04.342
(gasps)

39:07.386 --> 39:08.346
(grunts)

39:08.429 --> 39:10.848
(monitor flatlines)

39:39.794 --> 39:40.669
Where is she now?

39:45.341 --> 39:46.217
Carl's with her.

39:51.138 --> 39:54.558
I saw my future, Alan,
when I went to see him.

39:56.060 --> 39:57.686
I saw what lies ahead for me.

39:59.730 --> 40:01.440
That's not what lies ahead for you.

40:02.191 --> 40:04.443
Like the doctor said,
you smoke, you drink,

40:04.527 --> 40:06.404
you play with loaded firearms.

40:06.487 --> 40:08.447
You'll go before the mad cow can get you.

40:12.785 --> 40:15.037
I was in the courtroom today.
I heard your closing.

40:23.796 --> 40:26.215
-Um...
-When that day comes,

40:27.425 --> 40:28.300
if it comes...

40:31.554 --> 40:34.140
we should go to Oregon, where it's legal.

40:37.643 --> 40:41.981
They got some great steelhead runs
in Oregon.

40:42.064 --> 40:45.234
We could fish the mighty Rogue.

40:45.317 --> 40:46.735
It's only fitting.

40:47.653 --> 40:50.281
I mean, I am the mighty rogue,

40:50.364 --> 40:52.408
-when you think about it.
-(chuckles)

40:53.159 --> 40:54.160
Yes, you are.

40:55.661 --> 40:56.787
What a way to checkout,

40:57.538 --> 40:59.665
Scotch in one hand,
a steelhead in the other.

40:59.748 --> 41:01.208
And in your hands...

41:03.419 --> 41:04.295
would be me.

41:06.755 --> 41:09.091
If I could make that deal with God,
I'd do so right now.

41:09.592 --> 41:12.428
That's only because
if you could delay death

41:12.511 --> 41:15.514
until you were finally able to catch
a steelhead, you'd outlive us all.

41:16.432 --> 41:18.392
(chuckling) I'm sorry,
but you're a lousy fisherman.

41:19.268 --> 41:20.895
It needed to be said.

41:21.437 --> 41:23.564
I know what you're doing.
You're trying to change the subject.

41:24.190 --> 41:25.649
Denny, if you were in that courtroom,

41:25.733 --> 41:28.319
you saw how difficult it was for me
to think of you dying.

41:28.402 --> 41:31.822
I'd just like to enjoy my Scotch
and not have to think of it now.

41:32.865 --> 41:33.699
So just...

41:34.783 --> 41:38.078
sit there with your cigar,
if you don't mind, and blow smoke.

41:38.162 --> 41:40.748
-It's what you're best at.
-Fine.

41:40.831 --> 41:42.124
(chuckles)

41:43.501 --> 41:46.086
-Fine.
-You don't have to be so huffy about it.

41:48.797 --> 41:49.882
I had a day.

41:56.138 --> 41:57.014
Sleepover?

41:59.475 --> 42:00.309
Fine.

42:30.923 --> 42:32.132
NARRATOR: <i>Next on</i> Boston Legal...

42:32.216 --> 42:34.677
-What's going on, Jerry?
-I lost my cherry.

42:34.760 --> 42:36.220
We have a new client.

42:36.303 --> 42:38.097
He raped an eight-year-old girl.
He's been convicted.

42:38.180 --> 42:39.640
His lawyer's come to us
to handle his appeal.

42:39.723 --> 42:41.850
-Specifically, she asked for you.
-I'll pass.

42:41.934 --> 42:43.936
The appeal is before
the United States Supreme Court.

42:44.520 --> 42:47.314
You think you're going
to the Supreme Court without me?

42:47.398 --> 42:49.024
-Denny--
-The only thing missing from my legacy

42:49.108 --> 42:50.734
is an appearance
before the highest court in the land.

42:50.818 --> 42:54.446
WOMAN: Oyez. Oyez. Oyez.

42:54.530 --> 42:57.241
We're here, Alan.
We're really here. Look at us.

42:57.324 --> 43:00.369
In the Supreme Court of the United States.

43:02.246 --> 43:04.415
