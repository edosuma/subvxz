The following is my explanation.

01:41.602 --> 01:43.060
Well...

01:44.563 --> 01:48.232
more of an account
of what happened.

01:48.358 --> 01:51.277
I'd been on my own
for a while...

01:52.362 --> 01:54.197
and getting kind of...

01:54.323 --> 01:57.492
lonely and bored.

01:57.618 --> 01:59.577
Nothing to do all day.

02:00.996 --> 02:03.623
And that's when
I started shadowing.

[ Man #2 ]
"Shadowing"?

02:06.126 --> 02:09.419
[ Man #1 ] Shadowing. Following.
I started to follow people.

02:09.545 --> 02:12.673
- [ Man #2 ] Who?
- Anyone at first. Um —

02:12.800 --> 02:15.176
I mean, that was the whole point.
Somebody at random.

02:15.302 --> 02:17.261
Somebody who didn't know
who l was.

02:18.263 --> 02:20.681
[ Man #2 ]
And then?

02:20.808 --> 02:23.976
- [ Man #1 ] And then... nothing.
- "Nothing"?

02:24.102 --> 02:26.562
[ Man #1 ]
Nothing. I'd just see...

02:26.688 --> 02:28.940
where they went, what they did...

02:29.066 --> 02:32.151
and go home afterwards.

[ Man #2 ]
Why'd you do it?

02:34.947 --> 02:37.949
[ Man #1 ]
Um, to see where they went.

02:38.075 --> 02:40.076
Anyone — I mean —

02:41.829 --> 02:44.539
How can l explain?
You ever, um...

02:46.166 --> 02:49.168

just let your eyes...

02:50.587 --> 02:53.214
go over, drift across
a crowd of people...

02:54.383 --> 02:57.218
and they slowly stop
and fix on one person...

02:57.344 --> 03:01.013
and all of a sudden that person
isn't part of the crowd anymore?

03:01.181 --> 03:04.267
They've become an individual,
just like that.

- [ Snaps Fingers ]
- It just became irresistible.

03:07.437 --> 03:10.356
- So you followed women?
- No, I didn't follow women.

03:10.482 --> 03:12.400
It wasn't a sex thing.
I followed anybody.

03:12.526 --> 03:15.236
I just wanted to see
where they went and what they did.

You were playing secret agent?

No, I'm a writer.

03:20.033 --> 03:22.076
Well, I want to be a writer, anyway.

03:22.202 --> 03:25.997
I was gathering material
for my characters.

03:26.123 --> 03:28.040
Well, to begin with.

03:28.166 --> 03:31.043
After a while,
I spotted the dangers.

03:31.169 --> 03:34.046
I'd become hooked.
I had to start making up rules...

03:34.172 --> 03:37.174
to just try
and keep it under control.

03:37.301 --> 03:39.802
"Never follow people for too long."

03:39.928 --> 03:42.471
"Don't follow women
down dark alleys after dark."

03:42.598 --> 03:45.349
You know, stuff like that.

03:45.475 --> 03:48.311
lt was supposed
to just be completely random.

03:50.105 --> 03:52.315
And when it stopped being random...

03:52.441 --> 03:54.901
that's when it started to go wrong.

03:56.612 --> 04:00.072
When I started to follow people...

specific people, when I selected...

04:03.535 --> 04:06.579
a person to follow...

04:06.705 --> 04:08.331
that was when the trouble started.

Have you never...

04:16.882 --> 04:19.634
listened to other people's
conversations on the bus...

or is behaving...

like that and wondered...

what their lives involved,
what they do...

[ Typewriter Keys Clacking ]

04:57.381 --> 05:00.591
You watch somebody's behavior,
and it raises...

05:00.717 --> 05:02.635
a hundred thousand questions...

05:02.761 --> 05:07.181
and I wanted to ask
those questions...

05:07.307 --> 05:10.643
and l wanted to know
what the answers were.

05:10.769 --> 05:13.646
And so I'd follow people
to try and find out.

05:15.399 --> 05:18.651
The most important rule was...

05:18.777 --> 05:22.738
that even if I found out where
somebody worked or where they lived...

05:22.864 --> 05:25.324
then you would never follow
the same person twice.

05:25.450 --> 05:27.994
That was the most important rule.

05:28.120 --> 05:30.413
That was the one that I broke first.

- Come on. It's lunch.

You can tell a lot from the futon, for a start.
Young people have futons.

Most people wouldn't be
anywhere near 40 with a futon.

And they've got one laundry bag,
which means...
