Look, Val, there is
a huge fire in Soho.

00:03.920 --> 00:06.214
(TV reporter)
'We've just been informed
that three firefighters'

00:06.297 --> 00:08.800
'have been seriously injured
in a roof collapse.'

00:08.883 --> 00:10.927
Uh, Val, I am sure
that right now

00:11.010 --> 00:12.470
Vic is into his
third martini

00:12.554 --> 00:15.140
telling the bartender what
a freak his wife is, okay?

00:15.223 --> 00:16.641
[telephone rings]

00:16.725 --> 00:19.352
Look. That's probably him
right now, drunk dialing.

00:20.603 --> 00:23.606
Hello?

00:23.690 --> 00:25.442
It's the fire department.

00:26.359 --> 00:29.446
Yes, this is Mrs. Meladeo.

00:31.281 --> 00:32.866
Oh, God.

00:32.949 --> 00:36.786
(Holly)
'Val? Val? Val!'

00:40.582 --> 00:42.709
Wah! Check me out!

00:42.792 --> 00:43.918
Holly, how old are you?

00:44.002 --> 00:46.963
Nineteen. Look how funny
my feet look.

00:48.381 --> 00:49.758
Holly, stop riding the bed.

00:49.841 --> 00:51.426
You're gonna break it
before Vic even gets home

00:51.509 --> 00:53.261
from the hospital.

00:54.763 --> 00:56.806
You know what? Life is short.

00:56.890 --> 00:58.933
Ride the bed. Go skydiving.

00:59.017 --> 01:00.935
Go one day without panties.

01:02.812 --> 01:04.897
See, this is what I've
been talking about.

01:04.980 --> 01:07.233
She has been different
for the past three days.

01:07.317 --> 01:10.069
She's all open and mellow.

01:11.488 --> 01:13.656
Go ahead.
Find out for yourself.

01:13.740 --> 01:15.366
Okay.

01:16.201 --> 01:17.702
- Yeah. Hi, Val?
- Hmm.

01:17.786 --> 01:21.956
- Can I touch your boobs?
- Sure.

01:24.417 --> 01:27.378
Nah. Half the fun
is the chase.

01:28.671 --> 01:30.131
'You know what, ladies?'

01:30.215 --> 01:32.008
When you almost lose someone..

01:32.091 --> 01:34.594
...you realize you have
to enjoy every moment..

01:34.677 --> 01:37.013
...'cause you never know
when it could be your last.

01:37.096 --> 01:41.518
Mm-hmm. Someone's been sipping
the Kabbalah juice.

01:41.601 --> 01:42.894
You don't want
to regret anything.

01:42.977 --> 01:44.938
You don't want to
leave anything unsaid.

01:45.021 --> 01:47.023
That is why today when Vic
comes home from the hospital

01:47.106 --> 01:51.361
I am gonna make him a beautiful,
romantic champagne brunch..

01:51.444 --> 01:53.947
...and I'm gonna tell him
that I love him.

01:54.030 --> 01:57.992

So, Vince didn't get in till
like 1:00 last night.

02:43.997 --> 02:45.456
What were you two doing?

02:45.540 --> 02:46.958
Well, I don't know
what he was doing

02:47.041 --> 02:50.712
but I was lying in bed
wondering what he was doing.

02:50.795 --> 02:52.422
Oh, wait. He had to
work late again?

02:52.505 --> 02:56.259
Yes. Robyn is taking up every
second of his time with work.

02:56.342 --> 02:57.719
We were supposed to
have dinner last night

02:57.802 --> 03:00.346
and who suddenly needs
him at 8:00 at night?

03:00.430 --> 03:02.015
Robyn?!

03:02.098 --> 03:05.435
Look at how you put that
together, baby girl.

03:05.518 --> 03:08.396
Yes! And I am so trying
to not let this get to me

03:08.479 --> 03:09.939
but I can't help it.

03:10.023 --> 03:11.774
I swear, every time
that we have plans..

03:11.858 --> 03:14.277
...she has some work
thing for him to do.

03:15.695 --> 03:17.488
Wait. Why did you
just make air quotes?

03:17.572 --> 03:19.032
No, those weren't air quotes.

03:19.115 --> 03:21.367
I was just practicing what
I want to do to her eyes.

03:23.786 --> 03:25.371
- Hey.
- Oh, hey!

03:25.455 --> 03:27.624
Sorry I'm late, but
real-estate-mogul clothes

03:27.707 --> 03:31.711
take so much longer to get into
than bike-messenger clothes.

03:31.794 --> 03:34.005
It's okay. Aw.

03:34.088 --> 03:36.132
Do you realize that this is
our first time together

03:36.215 --> 03:38.801
since you and that Robyn
started to work together?

03:38.885 --> 03:40.803
- Mm-hmm.
- Mwah!

03:40.887 --> 03:43.640
She sure has been
working you awful hard.

03:43.723 --> 03:46.851
And I love it. Every morning,
I can't wait to go to work.

03:46.935 --> 03:48.728
I haven't felt
like this since..

03:48.811 --> 03:51.064
I don't know when I've
ever felt like this.

03:51.147 --> 03:55.109
Aw, and I love that
you are so excited.

03:55.193 --> 03:58.613
And I love that you work
with your ex-girlfriend.

03:58.696 --> 04:00.949
Holly, I'm getting off
work early tonight..

04:01.032 --> 04:04.035
...and I'm gonna have the most
romantic evening ever

04:04.118 --> 04:05.787
with my baby.

04:05.870 --> 04:09.374
Wait.
You mean me, right?

04:09.457 --> 04:12.210
- Of course.
- Yay, me! I'm the baby!

04:14.170 --> 04:16.839
- Vin?
- Vin?

04:16.923 --> 04:19.175
What happened to the "ce?"

Uh, you know Holly.

04:21.302 --> 04:22.762

- Oh, Thanks.
- Love your--

- So, get this Vin.
- "Ce."

Daddy thinks you're doing
such a great job

04:29.811 --> 04:32.146
he's decided to let you run
your first open house..

04:32.230 --> 04:33.439
...by yourself.

04:33.523 --> 04:36.901
- Are you kidding me?
- Congratulations!

04:39.988 --> 04:42.949
Okay, so, the one-sheets are in
here, and the owners are gone.

04:43.032 --> 04:45.410
So you can keep the place open
for the after-work crowd.

04:45.493 --> 04:48.746
Figure you'll be there
till at least 10:00.

04:48.830 --> 04:51.082
Oh, baby, I'm-I'm sorry
about our night.

04:51.165 --> 04:53.126
- Uh, Vin?
- Yeah, baby?

04:54.335 --> 04:56.045
Oh. Now look at that..

...getting your babies
all confused.

That's cute.

- Holly, I'm sorry--
- Vin, let's go.

05:04.470 --> 05:05.722
We can share a cab uptown.

05:05.805 --> 05:08.182
- Okay. I'll call you later?
- Sure.

05:08.266 --> 05:10.893
Bye, Holly.
Love your shoes.

05:10.977 --> 05:14.063
Bye, Robyn.
Hate your guts.

05:16.649 --> 05:18.443
- So?
- So?

05:18.526 --> 05:20.278
So? I mean, did
you see that?

05:20.361 --> 05:21.779
- Uh, yeah.
- Okay.

05:21.863 --> 05:23.531
So, you don't think I'm
crazy that I think that

05:23.614 --> 05:24.866
Robyn set up that open house

05:24.949 --> 05:27.744
just to get Vince alone
in a sexy penthouse?

05:27.827 --> 05:30.204
Uh, no.

05:30.288 --> 05:31.914
That sneaky ho.

05:33.207 --> 05:35.084
Yeah. You know, too bad
you got all mature.

05:35.168 --> 05:36.753
'Cause in the old days,
you would have made up some

05:36.836 --> 05:38.963
lame excuse and popped in there
and busted her..

05:39.047 --> 05:40.089
...just so she would
know she was messing

05:40.173 --> 05:41.466
with the wrong girl's man.

05:41.549 --> 05:43.301
Yes. Mm-hmm.

And I'm going
to do that again.

has its own beauty.

06:05.740 --> 06:07.617
You said "home."

06:07.700 --> 06:09.702
- I know.
- Wow.

06:09.786 --> 06:11.412
Look how far we've come.

06:11.496 --> 06:13.247
- Very far, yes.
- Mm-hmm.

We actually have two kids.

Yeah, you've been
in a coma a long time.

06:19.712 --> 06:21.005
Why are you nervous?

06:21.089 --> 06:22.757
- I'm not nervous.
- Yeah, you are.

06:22.840 --> 06:24.467
Whenever you get nervous,
you make jokes.

06:24.550 --> 06:28.554
Well, uh, I have a little
something I wanted to..

06:28.638 --> 06:31.224
...talk to you about so it might
be making me a little nervous.

06:31.307 --> 06:34.560
What? What?
What? What is it?

06:34.644 --> 06:35.853
Hold on. I can't tell
you right now.

06:35.937 --> 06:38.272
- Why?
- 'Cause my lips are busy. See?

06:38.356 --> 06:41.484
Oh. Yeah. Looks like
our wedding photo.

06:45.905 --> 06:47.323
Okay.

06:47.406 --> 06:50.660
I've been doing a lot of
thinking the past few days, um..

06:50.743 --> 06:55.873
...about us, about your
accident, and, um..

06:55.957 --> 06:58.501
...it's made me realize
how short life is..

06:58.584 --> 07:00.002
...and then when I got
that phone call--

07:00.086 --> 07:04.298
Okay, honey, honey, it's just
a little fracture, okay?

07:04.382 --> 07:05.508
No big deal.
I'm a tough guy.

07:05.591 --> 07:06.843
You'll toughen up, too.
You'll see.

07:06.926 --> 07:09.428
I mean, I've had cracked
ribs, smoke inhalation.

07:09.512 --> 07:11.055
I fractured a tibia.

07:11.139 --> 07:14.851
Wait, wait. So you've been
in the hospital before this?

07:14.934 --> 07:19.480
Please! I have a bedpan with
my name engraved on it.

07:19.564 --> 07:25.611
Wow. So...what you're saying is
this isn't out of the ordinary?

07:25.695 --> 07:28.322
Every time you
go to work..

07:28.406 --> 07:30.074
...something like
this could happen.

07:30.158 --> 07:32.702
Yeah. Yeah. Being married to me
is a real rollercoaster.

07:32.785 --> 07:37.123
Which, by the way, I can't go
on because, I'm scared of them.

07:39.750 --> 07:41.919
Yeah. Right.
I hate that feeling.

07:42.003 --> 07:44.213
Ah, tell me about it. When your
heart sinks into your stomach..

07:44.297 --> 07:45.715
...and you can't catch your
breath? It's like..

07:45.798 --> 07:47.842
..."No, thank you."

07:47.925 --> 07:50.553
- Ugh.
- Yeah.

07:50.636 --> 07:51.929
Anyway, I'm sorry.

07:52.013 --> 07:55.516
You said you had something
you wanted to tell me.

07:55.600 --> 07:58.186
Ummm-hmm. Yeah.

my boobies today.

is so sweet!

Damn, if I were
single and rich!

08:19.916 --> 08:22.084
But I'm neither,
so why harp on it?

08:22.168 --> 08:23.544
[doorbell rings]

08:23.628 --> 08:25.922
I got to go. Someone's here
to see the apartment.

08:28.591 --> 08:30.927
It's me!

08:31.010 --> 08:32.260
Holly, what are you doing here?

08:32.345 --> 08:34.554
Well, since you canceled
dinner tonight..

08:34.639 --> 08:36.432
...I thought that we could
have lunch together.

08:36.515 --> 08:38.851
Oh, baby, that's really
sweet, but I'm working.

08:38.934 --> 08:40.937
Well, a man's got
to eat, right?

08:41.020 --> 08:43.773
Whoa! This place
is schmancy.

08:43.856 --> 08:47.026
How many bedrooms
do you have in this place?

08:47.109 --> 08:49.779
And is someone in any of them?

08:49.862 --> 08:51.155
No. I'm all alone.

08:51.239 --> 08:53.616
Whoa, gosh.
What a pretty door.

08:53.699 --> 08:55.785
Is anything pretty behind it?

08:58.412 --> 09:00.915
Nice. Nice.

09:00.998 --> 09:02.833
Holly, I really appreciate
you bringing lunch..

09:02.917 --> 09:04.377
...and I would love
to hang out..

09:04.460 --> 09:05.962
Great! Then good.

09:06.045 --> 09:07.713
No, no, no.
I mean, I really..

09:07.797 --> 09:08.965
...what if somebody comes in?

09:09.048 --> 09:10.299
Why? Are you
expecting someone?

09:10.383 --> 09:11.717
Yeah, clients.

09:11.801 --> 09:13.010
Oh! Well, great.
You know what?

09:13.094 --> 09:15.638
I should stay and
act all interested.

09:15.721 --> 09:17.598
Oh, it could
hike up your price.

09:17.682 --> 09:20.017
Uh, baby, I got
that all covered.

09:20.101 --> 09:21.686
It's all part of my spiel.

09:21.769 --> 09:25.147
Ooh. Spiel? Wow.

09:25.231 --> 09:27.692
You sound all tycoon-y.

09:27.775 --> 09:31.946
- Say it again.
- Spiel, okay? Go.

09:32.029 --> 09:34.490
Wait. Can you use it
in a sentence?

09:34.573 --> 09:36.867
Can you go now, spiel?

09:37.994 --> 09:39.829
Okay. I can take a hint.

09:41.664 --> 09:42.999
Oh, wait, wait, wait.
You know what?

09:43.082 --> 09:44.375
I did forget something.

09:44.458 --> 09:47.545
Wonder how many square
feet is in this place.

09:52.133 --> 09:53.175
Ohh.

09:55.761 --> 09:59.348
- Robyn.
- Say what?

09:59.432 --> 10:01.976
Am I interrupting something?

10:02.059 --> 10:06.564
I knew it.
Yes, actually, you are.

10:06.647 --> 10:11.861
I'm just kissing my man.
You know, my man.

10:11.944 --> 10:14.071
Well, I don't want to stand
in the way of love.

10:14.155 --> 10:15.698
Why don't you two
get out of here?

10:15.781 --> 10:17.325
I'm-I'm.. But I'm working.

10:17.408 --> 10:19.827
Yeah, not so much anymore.

10:19.910 --> 10:21.370
- What?
- What?

10:21.454 --> 10:24.957
You were supposed to be working,
not making out with some chick.

10:25.041 --> 10:28.169
A client could have walked in.
The owners could have walked in.

10:28.252 --> 10:30.713
Sorry, Vin.
You're fired.

10:42.183 --> 10:44.101
Oh, my God. Did you
tell Vic you love him?

10:44.185 --> 10:45.978
What did he say?
What did you say?

10:46.062 --> 10:49.065
Why are you here?

10:49.148 --> 10:50.900
- I didn't say it.
- You didn't say it?

10:50.983 --> 10:52.568
Why didn't you say it?

10:52.651 --> 10:54.612
Lauren, have you ever
thought about what

10:54.695 --> 10:56.072
Vic does for a living?

10:56.155 --> 10:58.449
Yeah, he's one of
New York's bravest.

10:58.532 --> 11:00.618
I'm not.

11:00.701 --> 11:04.038
I cannot live every
day afraid, terrified

11:04.121 --> 11:05.790
that he might
not come home.

11:05.873 --> 11:08.959
Oh, God! Why didn't I get drunk
and marry an accountant?

11:09.794 --> 11:11.170
[telephone rings]

11:12.671 --> 11:16.717
Hello?
Val, uh, it's Vic.

11:16.801 --> 11:20.679
He says he's feeling really
dirty and needs a sponge bath.

11:22.139 --> 11:24.100
Well, I can't be
around him right now.

11:24.183 --> 11:28.437
Well, somebody's got to clean
out his nooks and crannies.

11:33.984 --> 11:35.486
I really appreciate this, Gary.

11:35.569 --> 11:36.779
Yeah, whatever.

11:36.862 --> 11:39.031
You know I'm not going
below the nipples.

11:41.700 --> 11:43.744
I won't do it.

11:50.918 --> 11:53.587
Vince, Vince, wait!

11:55.047 --> 11:57.174
You are so smart and talented.

11:57.258 --> 11:59.802
Another firm is gonna hire
you in two seconds.

11:59.885 --> 12:02.304
A better firm
with a guy boss.

12:02.388 --> 12:05.099
A guy boss who likes girls.

12:05.182 --> 12:08.686
You think this is so easy.
This was a huge break for me.

12:08.769 --> 12:11.272
They don't just give jobs like
these to bike messengers.

12:11.355 --> 12:12.857
And I can't believe you
actually came to my job

12:12.940 --> 12:14.150
to check up on me.

12:14.233 --> 12:16.610
No. No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no.

12:16.694 --> 12:18.571
I did not come
to check up on you.

12:18.654 --> 12:22.992
I came to check up on her, which
I was right about, by the way.

12:23.075 --> 12:24.368
She so wants you.

12:24.452 --> 12:26.495
Holly, I just got fired.

12:26.579 --> 12:28.622
I know, and, Vince,
I am so sorry.

12:28.706 --> 12:30.791
Holly, I really liked that job,
and I was good at it.

12:30.875 --> 12:32.460
I know. Which is why
you're gonna have

12:32.543 --> 12:34.295
a million other
opportunities.

12:34.378 --> 12:35.713
You know I'm not.

12:35.796 --> 12:37.465
I finally found something
I wanted to do

12:37.548 --> 12:39.049
and you screwed it all up.

12:39.133 --> 12:43.012
Well, I wouldn't have screwed it
up if it wasn't for that Robyn.

12:43.095 --> 12:44.430
God!

12:52.521 --> 12:54.523
- Oh! Whoa!
- Hey.

12:54.607 --> 12:55.733
What are you doing here?

12:55.816 --> 12:57.193
You're supposed to be in bed.

12:57.276 --> 12:58.694
This could be very harmful
to your recovery.

12:58.777 --> 13:01.572
Now get back upstairs
and don't be here.

13:01.655 --> 13:03.949
Well, I miss my nurse.

13:04.033 --> 13:05.576
Oh, jeez.

13:07.578 --> 13:10.164
I told you, Vic, what happens
in the sponge bath..

13:10.247 --> 13:12.166
...stays in the sponge bath.

13:14.335 --> 13:15.836
Not you. Her.

13:16.837 --> 13:17.922
Ingrate.

13:19.298 --> 13:21.926
- So, what you doing?
- Working.

13:22.009 --> 13:24.678
Oh. Working hard
or hardly working?

13:28.182 --> 13:31.227
- Okay, can you not follow me?
- Okay. Okay.

13:44.156 --> 13:45.407
What is wrong with you?

13:45.491 --> 13:48.118
I hurt my pelvis,
and I want attention.

13:48.202 --> 13:49.578
Yeah, Well, I can't
give it to you.

13:49.662 --> 13:51.664
- Why?
- 'Cause I just can't!

13:51.747 --> 13:53.832
But you said you were gonna
stay and take care of me.

13:53.916 --> 13:55.626
And then in the middle of
breakfast you got all weird.

13:55.709 --> 13:56.669
What happened?

13:56.752 --> 13:58.504
I-I got a lot on my mind.

13:58.587 --> 14:01.215
Well, let me help you.
I got nothing on mine.

14:01.298 --> 14:03.008
Can't you just
go back upstairs?

14:03.092 --> 14:04.510
Look, I don't get it.

14:04.593 --> 14:08.180
A few nights ago we
had this amazing kiss.

14:08.264 --> 14:10.766
What happened between
the kiss and the pelvis?

14:12.268 --> 14:14.853
You want to know what happened?
You want to know what happened?

14:16.063 --> 14:18.274
This! This happened, okay?

14:18.357 --> 14:19.817
And it could happen again.

14:19.900 --> 14:22.361
And, it could happen every
time you go out to work

14:22.444 --> 14:23.654
and I can't handle that.

14:23.737 --> 14:26.198
Baby, look, I'm fine, okay?

14:28.784 --> 14:29.910
See?

14:31.203 --> 14:33.747
And down.

14:33.831 --> 14:35.541
Vic, this isn't funny.

14:35.624 --> 14:37.626
Okay? Maybe next time
you won't be so lucky.

14:37.710 --> 14:40.629
I get that you're scared, okay?
But I fight fires.

14:40.713 --> 14:44.049
That's my job,
and I love what I do.

14:44.133 --> 14:46.510
- You love almost dying?
- No.

14:46.594 --> 14:49.305
No, that's not my
favorite part of the job.

14:49.388 --> 14:51.599
The hat's way cool.

14:51.682 --> 14:53.934
"The hat's way cool."
Okay, there you go again.

14:54.018 --> 14:56.353
Just keep on joking,
Vic, okay?

14:56.437 --> 14:59.148
Do you have any idea what
that phone call did to me?

14:59.231 --> 15:00.649
No, you don't.

15:00.733 --> 15:03.819
You want to wear a cool hat?
Get a job as a wizard.

15:16.123 --> 15:21.337
Hello? Rob?
It's me, Hol.

15:21.420 --> 15:23.005
Here to talk about Vin.

15:24.590 --> 15:26.842
Look, Holly,
I don't really have time.

15:26.925 --> 15:28.344
I have some prospective buyers.

15:28.427 --> 15:31.680
You want to make out with me
in front of them, too?

15:31.764 --> 15:37.728
Okay, Robyn can we talk,
<i>womano a womano?</i>

15:39.772 --> 15:40.981
I'm sorry.

15:41.065 --> 15:42.941
Vince never asked
me to come here.

15:43.025 --> 15:44.652
- I was just--
- Checking up on him?

15:46.111 --> 15:47.905
Wow. Pretty and smart.

15:49.490 --> 15:52.618
Look, Robyn, Vince
loves this job..

15:52.701 --> 15:55.329
...and if you gave him another
chance, I promise you'd realize

15:55.412 --> 15:57.539
that he's a huge asset
to your company.

15:57.623 --> 15:59.583
Oh, he is good, but..

15:59.667 --> 16:01.919
...unfortunately,
he has one problem..

16:02.002 --> 16:04.630
...and I'm looking
at it right now.

16:05.589 --> 16:07.716
Ouch.

16:07.800 --> 16:11.136
Alright. I get it.
Say no more.

16:11.220 --> 16:13.555
I promise, if you
let him come back

16:13.639 --> 16:16.016
this will never happen again.

16:16.100 --> 16:18.727
I suppose we could
make a deal.

16:18.811 --> 16:22.481
You rock! Rockin' Robyn!

16:23.524 --> 16:25.067
You haven't heard the deal yet.

16:25.150 --> 16:27.403
Okay. Lay it on me.

16:27.486 --> 16:31.448
Vince comes back if you
never show up at work again.

16:31.532 --> 16:36.161
You want to lay that out
a little more specifically?

16:36.245 --> 16:38.622
I never want to see you
in the office again.

16:38.706 --> 16:40.791
What's that, Rockin' Robyn?

16:40.874 --> 16:44.169
And if you do show up,
Vince will be fired.

16:47.381 --> 16:49.550
Oh, my God.
I knew it.

16:49.633 --> 16:51.593
You are trying to
steal my boyfriend.

16:51.677 --> 16:54.263
Wow.
Pretty and smart.

16:55.681 --> 17:00.102
So, looks like the ball's
in your court now, hon.

17:00.185 --> 17:04.064
How much do you want your
boyfriend to get his job back?

17:05.733 --> 17:07.025
Alright.

17:07.108 --> 17:10.445
Fine. We'll do
your little deal.

17:10.529 --> 17:13.198
But there's something you
have to know, baby girl.

17:14.700 --> 17:17.786
This is not as sweet
as it looks.

17:19.163 --> 17:21.248
- It's "go" time.
- So go.

17:21.330 --> 17:24.334
Don't worry.
I'm going.

17:40.476 --> 17:43.979
Oh! Looks like somebody's
codeine kicked in.

17:45.314 --> 17:48.067
What? I'm going
to be a wizard.

17:50.235 --> 17:51.653
You are insane.

17:51.737 --> 17:53.155
Well, I know it's ambitious

17:53.238 --> 17:55.491
but just think how safe
you'll be from the dragons.

17:57.201 --> 17:59.203
'Val, come here.'

17:59.286 --> 18:02.581
Remember that time I told you
that there were only two things

18:02.664 --> 18:04.249
in my life that I was
completely certain of.

18:04.333 --> 18:07.002
Joining the department
and marrying you.

18:07.086 --> 18:10.756
Well, today when I realized that
I couldn't have them both..

18:10.839 --> 18:15.260
...that made my decision
easy, so..

18:15.344 --> 18:17.513
...I quit.

18:17.596 --> 18:20.390
- You what?
- I quit.

18:20.474 --> 18:22.851
- Your job?
- No, drinking.

18:26.188 --> 18:28.524
Wait, wait. H-h-how could you
quit your job?

18:28.607 --> 18:29.691
You love your job.

18:29.775 --> 18:31.360
I thought that's what
you wanted me to do.

18:31.443 --> 18:34.154
How do you know what I want?
I don't even know what I want.

18:35.364 --> 18:37.783
You're a strange, strange woman.

18:40.744 --> 18:41.954
Come here. Come here.
Come here.

18:42.037 --> 18:44.665
- Yeah, no.
- Come on. You know you want to.

18:44.748 --> 18:45.833
Come on.

18:45.916 --> 18:48.085
Get up here.

18:54.466 --> 18:57.427
Vic, I don't want you
to quit your job.

18:57.511 --> 18:59.304
It's just today when
you started telling me

18:59.388 --> 19:03.141
about all your broken parts,
I started to picture things..

19:03.225 --> 19:05.102
...you know? Bad things.

19:05.185 --> 19:08.313
And then seeing you here
laying in the bed--

19:08.397 --> 19:09.898
Baby, listen.

19:09.982 --> 19:11.441
You're not the first
firefighter's wife

19:11.525 --> 19:13.610
to freak out about
her husband's job, okay?

19:13.694 --> 19:15.904
That's why when we quit, they
give us a two-week grace period

19:15.988 --> 19:17.489
in case we change our minds.

19:17.573 --> 19:21.410
It's called the "Holy crap, what
did I get myself into?" period.

19:22.911 --> 19:24.037
Is that really
what they call it--

19:24.121 --> 19:25.914
No, baby, it's not
what it's called.

19:28.000 --> 19:30.085
But you can change your mind.

19:34.089 --> 19:37.092
No, I don't think I can.

19:37.175 --> 19:41.471
'Cause I would rather have you
and worry than not have you.

19:47.561 --> 19:49.104
So, hmm.

19:49.187 --> 19:51.189
Six weeks laying around here.

19:51.273 --> 19:52.774
What are you gonna
do with yourself?

19:52.858 --> 19:57.988
Well, I was thinking maybe I
could do a little bit of this..

19:58.071 --> 20:01.450
...a little bit of that..

20:01.533 --> 20:04.202
...some of this.

20:04.286 --> 20:06.997
Mmm. Oh, pelvis!
Pelvis!

20:07.080 --> 20:08.707
Okay, sorry.
I'll just--

20:08.790 --> 20:10.959
- I'll go sleep upstairs.
- Okay.

20:15.756 --> 20:17.299
Okay, look.

20:17.382 --> 20:19.801
I-I've been trying to say
something to you all day

20:19.885 --> 20:21.762
but it just hasn't
been the right time

20:21.845 --> 20:24.348
and, you know, I wanted it
to be romantic and everything

20:24.431 --> 20:25.641
with the candles
and the music.

20:25.724 --> 20:27.392
I love you, too.

20:27.476 --> 20:31.188
Oh! Me too!

20:33.815 --> 20:37.361
- Hmm.
- Mmm. Mmm.

20:37.444 --> 20:39.571
Oh, pelvis pain!
Pelvis pain!

20:40.781 --> 20:42.866
I'm going.
I'm going.

20:48.956 --> 20:50.999
Damn you!

20:55.420 --> 20:57.089
[theme music]
