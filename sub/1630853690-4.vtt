00:53.928 --> 00:56.431
<i>As always, the problem of</i>
<i>limits.</i>

00:58.099 --> 01:00.101
<i>When to jack off</i>
<i>for the first time.</i>

01:01.519 --> 01:03.229
<i>The first successful</i>
<i>self-handling,</i>

01:03.313 --> 01:06.316
<i>ending a long trajectory</i>
<i>of frustrated fingers.</i>

01:07.901 --> 01:10.236
<i>A significant fingering attempt.</i>

01:10.987 --> 01:12.071
<i>When I was 10,</i>

01:12.155 --> 01:14.032
<i>I would get home from school,</i>

01:14.115 --> 01:16.826
<i>and think about a classmate</i>
<i>I thought was a wiener.</i>

01:16.910 --> 01:18.411
<i>Cristian...</i>

01:18.495 --> 01:19.788
<i>Asshole.</i>

01:19.871 --> 01:23.458
<i>He'd follow me around school</i>
<i>and say: "You're hot."</i>

01:23.541 --> 01:24.876
<i>I'd throw rocks at him.</i>

01:24.959 --> 01:27.003
<i>He'd buy me a candy bar</i>
<i>at the kiosk,</i>

01:27.086 --> 01:28.546
<i>I'd throw rocks at him.</i>

01:28.630 --> 01:31.007
<i>He tried to be nice and...rocks.</i>

01:31.090 --> 01:32.592
<i>Until one day at home:</i>

01:32.675 --> 01:34.594
<i>no rocks, yes masturbation.</i>

01:34.677 --> 01:35.970
<i>Masturbation attempt that is,</i>

01:36.054 --> 01:37.180
<i>because I didn't really know</i>
<i>what to do</i>

01:37.263 --> 01:39.307
<i>with my flaming pussy.</i>

01:39.390 --> 01:41.684
<i>Fast forward to age 15.</i>

01:41.768 --> 01:43.478
<i>From 10 to 14,</i>

01:43.561 --> 01:45.688
<i>it was a chain</i>
<i>of failed fingering.</i>

01:45.772 --> 01:48.650
<i>I did try to sneak in</i>
<i>a flashlight once.</i>

01:48.733 --> 01:51.444
<i>It was tiny and red,</i>
<i>just like that.</i>

01:51.528 --> 01:53.404
<i>At 15, face down...</i>

03:04.017 --> 03:06.477
THE PACK

03:29.125 --> 03:31.336
-Good evening.
-Hello, good evening.

03:31.419 --> 03:32.754
Any serious injuries?

03:32.837 --> 03:33.922
Not at all.

03:34.005 --> 03:36.090
Hi.

03:36.174 --> 03:38.593
I'm going to have
to take a statement from you.

03:41.429 --> 03:43.056
What's your name?

03:43.139 --> 03:44.724
Sofía Radich.

03:46.684 --> 03:48.353
How old are you, Sofía?

03:48.436 --> 03:50.021
Seventeen.

04:07.705 --> 04:10.124
<i>A tragic turn of events today</i>

04:10.208 --> 04:13.002
<i>for a string of demonstrations</i>
<i>and charges</i>

04:13.086 --> 04:15.922
<i>filed by a group of students</i>
<i>from Santa Inés High,</i>

04:16.005 --> 04:17.799
<i>against a teacher.</i>

04:20.885 --> 04:23.930
-Hello?
-<i>You stole a little girl.</i>

04:24.013 --> 04:26.057
<i>Now she has been stolen from</i>
<i>you.</i>

04:26.140 --> 04:28.309
<i>You'd better take care</i>
<i>of the one you have left.</i>

04:29.477 --> 04:31.562
-Was it him?
-Celeste?

04:31.646 --> 04:33.189
-What did he say?
-Where's Celeste?

05:10.768 --> 05:12.186
I'm looking for Tanaka.

05:12.270 --> 05:14.230
There's nobody here by that
name.

05:15.273 --> 05:17.025
He knows who I am.

05:17.108 --> 05:18.693
Alex.

05:21.487 --> 05:22.613
Look up.

05:46.471 --> 05:47.722
Nice computer.

05:47.805 --> 05:49.348
It's not mine, it's The Wolf's.

05:49.432 --> 05:51.267
The man who kidnapped my sister.

05:55.521 --> 05:56.522
ACCESS DENIED

06:01.069 --> 06:02.153
A week.

06:02.236 --> 06:04.489
My sister could be dead in a
week.

06:04.572 --> 06:06.365
It has to be sooner.

06:07.658 --> 06:10.536
You're a good hacker, Celeste.
I'm better.

06:10.620 --> 06:12.622
But neither of us works magic.

06:12.705 --> 06:13.831
This is impossible.

06:14.874 --> 06:18.294
-Nobody... almost nobody.
-Who?

06:20.421 --> 06:23.299
We hack systems,
but Z cracks them.

06:23.382 --> 06:25.051
But I thought Z wasn't real,

06:25.134 --> 06:26.719
that it was a fake name, a myth.

06:30.139 --> 06:31.974
How can I find Z?

06:32.058 --> 06:34.102
I won't work with him.

06:34.185 --> 06:36.187
I don't care. How can I find
him?

06:42.485 --> 06:43.820
There's an address there.

06:43.903 --> 06:47.865
Whatever you tell Z,
keep me out of it completely.

07:00.920 --> 07:02.213
Fuck!

07:03.881 --> 07:05.842
Stop the car, please.

07:19.897 --> 07:21.149
MISSING

07:24.318 --> 07:25.361
Fuck!

07:30.158 --> 07:32.493
Days go by,
my daughter isn't showing up.

07:32.577 --> 07:34.495
At least money interests people,

07:34.579 --> 07:35.872
now they'll pay attention--

07:35.955 --> 07:37.623
Interest in money,
you've said it yourself.

07:37.707 --> 07:39.959
Interest because there's money.
Then what?

07:40.042 --> 07:41.419
We'll be flooded by fake leads.

07:41.502 --> 07:43.337
That'll drive us away
from our true goal.

07:43.421 --> 07:46.007
It's a textbook case.
I've been doing this a while.

07:49.635 --> 07:51.596
There's something
you need to know.

07:55.057 --> 07:56.934
Belmar was the one
who gave me Blanca.

08:00.730 --> 08:02.106
Not just that.

08:02.190 --> 08:04.108
For over a decade...

08:05.651 --> 08:07.445
he sold children...

08:09.071 --> 08:10.990
and I was his accomplice.

08:16.621 --> 08:21.500
He'd locate teenage mothers
at the church.

08:26.339 --> 08:27.673
He'd offer his help,

08:27.757 --> 08:29.759
he'd take them in with his
family.

08:30.760 --> 08:33.346
Then he'd coordinate

08:33.429 --> 08:35.556
with the hospital's medical
team,

08:35.640 --> 08:37.391
and when the babies were born,

08:37.475 --> 08:39.519
he'd pass them off as dead.

08:39.602 --> 08:40.895
Being so young,

08:40.978 --> 08:42.355
the mothers didn't ask
questions.

08:42.438 --> 08:44.315
Then he'd...sell them...

08:46.359 --> 08:49.528
to couples who were desperate
for a child.

08:49.612 --> 08:53.533
Couples like María and me.

08:54.575 --> 08:56.077
You're only telling me this now?

09:00.873 --> 09:05.002
Look, Belmar is protected
by several important people.

09:05.086 --> 09:06.587
I know.

09:07.630 --> 09:10.633
That's why I'm asking you
to work with me from now on.

09:10.716 --> 09:12.009
-Agreed?
-Yes.

09:12.093 --> 09:13.636
No more improvising.

09:14.387 --> 09:17.056
Will you always be tracking her?

09:17.139 --> 09:20.184
Yes, we have a complete
tracking system.

09:20.268 --> 09:22.937
All we ask is that you trust us,
because otherwise...

09:23.020 --> 09:25.231
We trust you
but we need to be informed.

09:25.314 --> 09:26.482
Celeste, sweetie!

09:26.565 --> 09:28.985
My baby, my baby!

09:29.068 --> 09:30.736
Where were you?

09:31.737 --> 09:34.156
-What's she doing here?
-Hello, Celeste.

09:34.240 --> 09:36.450
They're helping us, Celeste.

09:36.534 --> 09:38.995
Nobody's helping us, Mom.
What's this?

09:39.078 --> 09:41.330
Do you think they want money?
This is worthless.

09:44.417 --> 09:46.627
Did you already try a call?
It works?

09:46.711 --> 09:48.254
Are you sure?

09:48.337 --> 09:50.381
-Head to your room.
-This is ready.

09:50.464 --> 09:53.092
We can track
any incoming call to this house.

09:53.175 --> 09:56.053
It's important that María
answers.
He'll be likelier to speak.

09:56.137 --> 09:57.888
Mom, have you still not
realized?

09:57.972 --> 09:59.932
Nobody's looking for Blanca.

10:00.016 --> 10:03.311
-Now they want to monitor us.
-That's not true, Celeste.

10:03.394 --> 10:06.105
My sister is missing
and you do nothing.

10:06.188 --> 10:08.024
You don't get it, Celeste.

10:08.107 --> 10:10.568
This is getting dangerous
for all of us.

10:10.651 --> 10:12.028
We have to trust the police.

10:12.111 --> 10:14.030
-No!
-Yes, we have to trust them.

10:14.113 --> 10:15.281
No! Know what?

10:15.364 --> 10:16.741
Put microphones at Belmar's
house.

10:16.824 --> 10:19.368
Or Ossandón's,
or the rugby locker room,

10:19.452 --> 10:20.620
but not here.

10:20.703 --> 10:22.079
Listen to me.

10:23.039 --> 10:24.457
Ossandón killed himself,

10:24.540 --> 10:25.958
a few hours ago.

10:27.376 --> 10:29.253
He did it in front of Sofía.

10:30.421 --> 10:32.423
-He killed himself?
-Yes.

10:34.884 --> 10:36.886
I'm glad Ossandón killed
himself,

10:38.304 --> 10:40.306
but my sister's still out there,

10:40.389 --> 10:42.975
and none of you are doing
anything to help her.

10:51.275 --> 10:52.568
Celeste.

10:53.486 --> 10:56.197
-Forgive her.
-It's fine, I understand.

10:57.365 --> 10:59.825
In her case I would be the
same...

10:59.909 --> 11:01.202
or worse.

11:01.285 --> 11:02.453
She needs time.

11:08.751 --> 11:10.252
z hacker news

11:10.336 --> 11:12.171
Who is Z? The famous hacker...

11:12.254 --> 11:14.757
What's the meaning
behind Z's mask?

11:20.304 --> 11:22.223
Z's address

11:33.692 --> 11:39.782
Z, I need to contact you

11:40.408 --> 11:41.450
You have been disconnected.

11:51.836 --> 11:53.796
All these pretty houses
are filled with secrets.

11:55.506 --> 11:57.383
That's why I live in the hills.

11:58.259 --> 12:00.344
Blanca's illegal adoption
is just an example,

12:00.428 --> 12:01.804
there are many more.

12:04.932 --> 12:07.685
There's an alpha we still
haven't managed to find.

12:07.768 --> 12:09.437
I know.

12:09.520 --> 12:11.313
But I believe Benjamín
when he says

12:11.397 --> 12:13.983
that they don't know him,
there's no tie.

12:14.066 --> 12:15.734
Ossandón didn't fit that
profile.

12:15.818 --> 12:18.195
But what about Belmar?
He's different.

12:19.155 --> 12:21.907
He's knew them as kids,
he has a lot of power over them,

12:21.991 --> 12:25.578
-they eat from his hand.
-That's why, everyone knows him.

12:25.661 --> 12:27.288
Maybe he's not alone.

12:27.371 --> 12:31.167
Funny that the Pack's parents
are the school's main
financiers.

12:32.460 --> 12:35.379
For now I'll pursue
investigating Belmar.

12:35.463 --> 12:37.339
-Let's see what's there.
-OK.

12:41.302 --> 12:44.305
Carla, I want you to probe
Sarmiento Clinic.

12:44.388 --> 12:47.766
Check everything,
useful or not, as always.

12:49.018 --> 12:50.144
OK.

12:51.937 --> 12:54.315
I need to corroborate data

12:54.398 --> 12:58.319
regarding stillbirths
between 2001 and 2005.

12:58.402 --> 13:01.780
Ideally original files,
that's what I need.

13:01.864 --> 13:03.324
I'm sorry, Deputy Commissioner,

13:03.407 --> 13:06.243
but you're asking for documents
from 10, 20 years ago.

13:06.327 --> 13:08.412
-I know, but--
-The files got digitalized.

13:08.496 --> 13:09.663
They're incomplete.

13:09.747 --> 13:11.749
And the original files are gone?

13:11.832 --> 13:13.334
They were lost.

13:13.417 --> 13:15.753
That wing has been closed
for over 10 years.

13:15.836 --> 13:17.546
Right after the deaths.

13:17.630 --> 13:20.799
-May I? They're waiting.
-Of course.

13:55.251 --> 13:58.504
RESTRICTED AREA

14:00.506 --> 14:01.632
Girls...

14:04.009 --> 14:06.136
It's our right!

14:07.179 --> 14:09.515
We're collaborating
with the police.

14:12.851 --> 14:14.687
What are those fuckers doing
here?

14:14.770 --> 14:16.522
You dipshits!

14:16.605 --> 14:18.399
What are you doing here?

14:18.482 --> 14:19.567
Assholes!

14:19.650 --> 14:21.443
Relax, let them through!

14:21.527 --> 14:23.445
How can you still defend
those rapists?

14:23.529 --> 14:26.365
The police released them
without any charges.

14:26.448 --> 14:27.616
They have a right to be here.

14:27.700 --> 14:29.118
You're an accomplice!

14:29.201 --> 14:31.745
Belmar is an accomplice
to these rapists!

14:33.539 --> 14:35.207
Look, they're his cubs.

14:36.166 --> 14:37.751
Look how he takes care of them.

14:38.836 --> 14:40.087
See you at the station.

14:40.170 --> 14:42.464
-Should the Rector resign?
-Obviously!

14:42.548 --> 14:44.425
Do you expect to return to
class?

14:44.508 --> 14:46.927
How could we?
Look what's happening.

14:47.011 --> 14:49.513
Does everyone agree,
or is there division?

14:49.597 --> 14:53.976
No, but every day,
more realize what truly matters.

14:54.059 --> 14:56.687
It'll be resolved soon,
don't worry.

14:56.770 --> 14:59.690
-It'll be over soon.
-I need to talk to you.

15:01.025 --> 15:03.360
-I can't right now.
-It has to be now.

15:38.312 --> 15:40.189
You have to understand.

15:40.272 --> 15:43.025
Those young men are good people,
I know them very well.

15:43.108 --> 15:45.694
Not only am I their teacher,
their coach.

15:46.487 --> 15:49.073
My job is to guide them
spiritually.

15:50.199 --> 15:52.117
They tell me their problems.

15:52.201 --> 15:54.078
I try to help them.

15:55.663 --> 16:00.501
Augusto, Eduardo and Benjamín,
in their respective interviews,

16:00.584 --> 16:03.504
all confessed to having
consensual group sex

16:03.587 --> 16:05.297
with one of your students.

16:06.048 --> 16:08.258
They also said it wasn't
the first time.

16:09.760 --> 16:13.180
If you know them so well,
so intimately,

16:13.263 --> 16:15.432
they tell you their problems,
confess their sins.

16:15.516 --> 16:17.101
How did you miss
what was happening

16:17.184 --> 16:18.310
right in front of you?

16:18.394 --> 16:20.646
What is said in confession
is a secret.

16:22.690 --> 16:25.025
Only one authority
could make me speak,

16:25.109 --> 16:26.777
and that's not you.

16:28.195 --> 16:29.446
So you knew.

16:32.908 --> 16:35.786
It's a complicated age,
Commissioner.

16:35.869 --> 16:39.790
The most I can do is lead these
boys on the righteous path.

16:39.873 --> 16:43.794
Try to channel that...energy.

16:45.295 --> 16:47.756
Did you also have Ossandón
pray and run

16:47.840 --> 16:49.091
to control his impulses?

16:50.551 --> 16:52.678
How much longer
will you spend ruining

16:52.761 --> 16:54.471
that poor man's reputation?

16:54.555 --> 16:57.349
Blanca was at his home
hours before disappearing

16:57.433 --> 16:58.642
and Ossandón kept it a secret.

16:58.726 --> 17:01.145
Now you want to accuse him
of kidnapping as well.

17:01.228 --> 17:04.273
In fact, he kidnapped two minors
before committing suicide.

17:07.568 --> 17:10.154
But I wonder if he wasn't
protecting someone.

17:11.488 --> 17:12.656
You?

17:32.509 --> 17:34.845
<i>You know your students</i>
<i>very well, right?</i>

17:37.014 --> 17:38.515
<i>Your rugby players.</i>

17:38.599 --> 17:40.350
Your cubs.

17:46.148 --> 17:48.108
How about Blanca?

17:48.192 --> 17:49.651
Do you know Blanca well?

17:50.486 --> 17:51.653
Of course.

17:52.738 --> 17:56.033
We've had our differences,
but I've known her from birth.

17:56.116 --> 17:57.201
I baptized her.

17:57.284 --> 17:59.703
No, you didn't just baptize her.

17:59.787 --> 18:02.456
You brought her into the world
and gave her to the Ibarras.

18:02.539 --> 18:03.749
Excuse me?

18:25.187 --> 18:28.941
MEDICAL RECORD

18:31.276 --> 18:35.781
To be precise, you sold her
to them illegally, didn't you?

18:41.620 --> 18:43.413
Look, Commissioner.

18:43.497 --> 18:45.666
I know that Bruno is a wreck.

18:47.668 --> 18:49.837
Blanca was given up
for adoption, yes.

18:51.296 --> 18:53.715
But I'm not the one
who handled her history.

18:55.050 --> 18:57.052
So in that sense,
I can't help you.

19:02.224 --> 19:03.684
Alright.

19:03.767 --> 19:06.520
I believe I have kindly answered
all of your questions.

19:06.603 --> 19:09.273
Now I'm going to ask you
to please leave.

19:09.356 --> 19:11.441
I have other things to tend to.

19:16.071 --> 19:19.783
Wouldn't it be uncomfortable
if this story were made public?

19:24.121 --> 19:25.956
Matthew 5:45.

19:27.291 --> 19:30.711
God causes the sun to rise
on the evil and the good,

19:31.879 --> 19:36.592
and sends rain on the righteous
and the unrighteous, equally.

19:36.675 --> 19:39.428
I'm sorry to contradict Matthew,
Father.

19:39.511 --> 19:41.597
But my job is to catch
the unrighteous

19:41.680 --> 19:43.682
and make sure it rains
hard on them.

19:43.765 --> 19:46.935
Then you must not be doing
your job well, Commissioner.

19:48.145 --> 19:50.647
It's your fault
that an innocent man

19:50.731 --> 19:52.441
took his own life.

19:52.524 --> 19:55.527
Who knows which other horrors
will take place?

19:57.696 --> 19:59.907
Why is nobody picking up?

19:59.990 --> 20:02.075
Because they won't stop calling
to bother us.

20:02.159 --> 20:04.870
-Don't pick up, Celeste.
-Stop calling!

20:05.829 --> 20:07.581
This is insane.

20:07.664 --> 20:08.916
What's wrong with you two?

20:09.750 --> 20:12.294
-Mom, what is it?
-I don't know what they want.

20:12.377 --> 20:14.546
You do know what they want.

20:14.630 --> 20:15.797
You know.

20:17.424 --> 20:19.801
They want us to pay
for what we've done.

20:19.885 --> 20:21.428
Celeste doesn't deserve this.

20:21.511 --> 20:23.221
-We do, but she doesn't.
-María...

20:23.305 --> 20:25.766
-What's going on, Mom?
-No more!

20:25.849 --> 20:28.352
Stop, please! No more lies!

20:28.435 --> 20:29.728
-Mom?
-It's enough!

20:29.811 --> 20:30.854
Mom?

20:30.938 --> 20:32.606
Blanca isn't your
biological sister.

20:41.949 --> 20:43.909
We stole a baby girl,

20:44.785 --> 20:47.788
and now someone wants us
to pay for it.

20:49.623 --> 20:51.625
I'm not going to expose you.

20:53.585 --> 20:56.380
We need to get you out
of this house.

20:56.463 --> 20:58.215
-My daughter.
-No, let me go!

20:58.298 --> 21:00.175
-Don't ever touch me...
-No...

21:00.259 --> 21:01.718
Listen to us.

21:02.803 --> 21:04.221
You have to understand.

21:07.015 --> 21:09.101
Please, say something!

21:10.519 --> 21:12.062
I'm not going anywhere.

21:12.938 --> 21:15.357
-I'll take care of myself.
-No, no, sweetie.

21:15.440 --> 21:17.442
You can't,
not in these conditions.

21:17.526 --> 21:20.570
You can't protect me either,
so what's the difference?

21:20.654 --> 21:22.948
If someone wants to come for me,
they will.

21:23.031 --> 21:25.075
-Just like they did with Blanca.
-No.

21:25.993 --> 21:27.828
Aren't you ashamed?

21:28.954 --> 21:30.664
You two realize you're sick,
right?

21:30.747 --> 21:32.207
-Let me explain, please.
-No.

21:33.208 --> 21:34.584
There's nothing to explain.

21:35.669 --> 21:38.046
I don't care that Blanca
doesn't have my blood.

21:38.130 --> 21:39.840
She is my sister.

21:40.716 --> 21:41.883
But you...

21:42.968 --> 21:45.095
You're perfect strangers to me.

22:05.365 --> 22:07.492
<i>What do you believe</i>
<i>is the destiny,</i>

22:07.576 --> 22:09.453
<i>the future of criminology?</i>

22:09.536 --> 22:13.081
Because we're tired of seeing
morbidly obese policemen

22:13.165 --> 22:14.916
running after criminals.

22:15.000 --> 22:18.795
Forensic psychiatrists working
from their desks and computers,

22:18.879 --> 22:20.714
comfortably analyzing

22:20.797 --> 22:22.299
these characters
and their structures

22:22.382 --> 22:24.426
without lifting a finger
or a foot.

22:24.509 --> 22:26.303
What we need are people

22:26.386 --> 22:28.805
who can tap
into the mental structure

22:28.889 --> 22:30.640
of these psychopaths.

22:30.724 --> 22:35.395
Untangle criminals' profiles.

22:35.479 --> 22:36.897
And I ask you:

22:36.980 --> 22:42.861
Why is it important to know
a criminal's profile in depth?

22:42.944 --> 22:44.571
To find clues.

22:47.115 --> 22:49.701
A correct, yet mediocre answer.

22:49.785 --> 22:51.620
To see the future.

22:59.628 --> 23:00.879
What's your name?

23:00.962 --> 23:02.422
Elisa Murillo.

23:29.783 --> 23:31.535
I see you did your homework.

23:32.536 --> 23:35.539
The press is having a feast
with this.

23:35.622 --> 23:37.999
It's good that this is
happening.

23:38.083 --> 23:41.086
That's what's keeping
Blanca alive.

23:41.169 --> 23:43.296
Why do you think
a body hasn't shown up?

23:44.673 --> 23:46.174
The police are lost.

23:46.258 --> 23:48.385
We can't expect anything
from those analysts,

23:48.468 --> 23:50.470
whereas you...
you should have a clue,

23:50.554 --> 23:52.514
an indication, something, right?

23:52.597 --> 23:55.100
-This isn't an act of revenge.
-No, it's not.

23:55.183 --> 23:58.562
Nor is it...a rape gone awry.

23:59.312 --> 24:00.689
It's not just abuse.

24:02.774 --> 24:04.818
And how is it that you always
have the answers,

24:04.901 --> 24:06.444
even before us?

24:24.254 --> 24:25.422
Early this morning,

24:25.505 --> 24:27.883
I was obsessing over a Borges
book

24:27.966 --> 24:30.051
that I couldn't find anywhere.

24:30.135 --> 24:31.970
It took me hours, but I found
it.

24:32.053 --> 24:34.347
It tells the story
of an imaginary man,

24:34.431 --> 24:37.058
who decides to create
other imaginary men.

24:38.643 --> 24:40.896
<i>That's what this game is doing?</i>

24:40.979 --> 24:42.564
<i>No.</i>

24:42.647 --> 24:44.983
<i>It's creating invisible men,</i>

24:45.066 --> 24:48.445
<i>who are weak, humiliated,</i>
<i>and have miserable lives.</i>

24:48.528 --> 24:49.821
-Hey.
-Hey.

24:51.781 --> 24:53.325
-All set.
-How did it go?

24:53.408 --> 24:55.202
-Great.
-Let's see.

24:58.121 --> 25:00.707
-Hey, be cool though.
-Yeah.

25:01.833 --> 25:03.001
Gonzalo?

25:08.632 --> 25:09.716
How's that?

25:09.799 --> 25:11.426
Nice piece, Gonzalo!

25:11.509 --> 25:13.929
We have all four.
Let's send them to The Wolf.

25:14.012 --> 25:15.472
Let's do it.

25:24.356 --> 25:26.483
CONGRATULATIONS, YOU REACHED
THE NEXT LEVEL.

25:26.566 --> 25:28.777
LEAVE MY MARK ON THE MOST
FRAGILE WOMAN YOU FIND.

25:28.860 --> 25:30.028
YOU HAVE 24 HOURS.

25:35.533 --> 25:37.744
They called again.
I've tracked the call.

25:37.827 --> 25:39.996
-Where to?
-A shipping yard.

25:40.080 --> 25:41.957
-Near Santa Inés.
-OK, I'm on it.

25:42.040 --> 25:45.043
-Alone it's too dangerous.
-No time for backup.

25:46.253 --> 25:49.381
<i>Exit the highway to the right,</i>
<i>onto a dirt road.</i>

25:52.342 --> 25:54.928
<i>Drive 300 meters and turn right.</i>

25:56.012 --> 25:57.305
<i>That's it.</i>

25:57.973 --> 26:00.016
<i>Keep going about 50 meters.</i>

26:01.393 --> 26:03.561
<i>And now, turn left.</i>

26:05.522 --> 26:07.565
<i>Now, the red container.</i>

26:09.192 --> 26:11.361
<i>Drive straight. That's it.</i>

26:14.572 --> 26:17.450
Now, there's a yellow container
and a red one.

26:17.534 --> 26:18.994
Turn right, that's it.

26:21.204 --> 26:22.872
<i>Keep going a few meters.</i>

26:22.956 --> 26:25.625
<i>You'll find a yellow container</i>
<i>next to a gray one.</i>

26:26.668 --> 26:29.045
On your right, a red container.

26:30.005 --> 26:32.757
<i>At the end there's</i>
<i>an orange container</i>

26:32.841 --> 26:34.801
<i>and a gray one, there.</i>

26:34.884 --> 26:36.553
Wait, wait, wait.

26:45.478 --> 26:47.897
<i>Maybe women were the first</i>
<i>to humiliate him.</i>

26:49.316 --> 26:51.401
<i>The first to make him feel weak.</i>

26:53.486 --> 26:55.530
<i>He won't just attack his</i>
<i>victims,</i>

26:56.573 --> 26:58.241
<i>but also their families.</i>

27:02.912 --> 27:04.581
Stop! Police!

27:04.664 --> 27:07.083
<i>Why would he kill a young woman</i>
<i>and dump her body?</i>

27:07.167 --> 27:10.003
And why is he keeping
Blanca alive?

27:12.630 --> 27:14.841
Blanca is a leader.

27:14.924 --> 27:15.967
And like any leader,

27:16.051 --> 27:19.012
she must be disciplined,
humiliated.

27:19.095 --> 27:22.349
<i>He's waiting for the moment</i>
<i>he can do the most harm.</i>

27:22.432 --> 27:24.893
<i>Playing with loved ones,</i>
<i>family members.</i>

27:24.976 --> 27:26.728
<i>That's the only reason</i>
<i>Blanca's alive.</i>

27:27.771 --> 27:28.772
What are you doing?

27:28.855 --> 27:29.898
-He paid me to make a call.
-Who?

27:29.981 --> 27:31.566
-He didn't say his name.
-Who?

27:31.649 --> 27:32.984
I don't know!

27:47.290 --> 27:48.541
Gringo:
Did you give her the tattoo?

27:48.625 --> 27:50.043
Coke: You're the only one left.

27:50.126 --> 27:53.129
Box: Only 12 hours left.

27:58.176 --> 27:59.552
EVERYONE MUST SEND A PHOTO
TO GET THE NEXT TEST.

27:59.636 --> 28:01.346
IF ONE FAILS,
EVERYONE IS ELIMINATED.

28:01.429 --> 28:03.473
I'll do it.

28:19.280 --> 28:21.199
SEARCH CONTINUES FOR
MISSING CHILD...

28:21.282 --> 28:22.575
Who is The Wolf?

28:23.993 --> 28:26.204
IF YOU WANT TO KEEP
YOUR SISTER ALIVE...

28:30.041 --> 28:32.210
YOU MUST DO AS I SAY.

28:34.421 --> 28:37.424
What do I have to do?

28:37.507 --> 28:40.635
TARNISH HER.

29:05.785 --> 29:07.704
Dance with me like this!

29:08.705 --> 29:10.748
That's it, that's it!

29:15.086 --> 29:17.630
More! Too lame, too shy!

29:20.925 --> 29:23.136
Yeah, you're very unsexy...

29:26.681 --> 29:28.224
They'll love you.

29:28.308 --> 29:31.478
Cut, cut!

29:32.687 --> 29:34.939
-That was the best one.
-No, it's too much.

29:35.023 --> 29:36.900
No way I'd use this
for a college application!

29:36.983 --> 29:40.904
I think this whole house
is nothing without me.

29:40.987 --> 29:43.198
-Nothing!
-You're center of the universe.

29:43.281 --> 29:45.700
Yeah, yeah. That's it.

30:13.394 --> 30:16.314
viralizing images...

30:23.571 --> 30:26.574
He never showed
signs of depression?

30:26.658 --> 30:29.410
No, never like this.

30:29.494 --> 30:32.121
We've always communicated
very well.

30:33.414 --> 30:35.708
And suddenly he never spoke
again.

30:35.792 --> 30:37.710
He just sits there all day.

30:39.671 --> 30:41.714
Let me speak to him alone.

31:05.113 --> 31:07.615
On a team,
when one person wavers...

31:09.284 --> 31:10.743
everyone resents him.

31:13.037 --> 31:15.582
Whereas when the group
stays united...

31:18.293 --> 31:19.669
it's impossible to break it.

31:19.752 --> 31:21.421
I don't want to go back, Father.

31:22.171 --> 31:23.214
I never want to go back.

31:25.550 --> 31:28.636
Christ's disciples doubted, too.

31:30.430 --> 31:31.639
They were afraid.

31:32.348 --> 31:33.349
They sinned.

31:34.726 --> 31:36.978
But thanks to the fact
that they stayed together...

31:37.979 --> 31:39.897
Christianity is still alive
today.

31:39.981 --> 31:41.608
I'm no one's disciple.

31:45.612 --> 31:46.738
Look at me.

31:49.824 --> 31:52.243
Look at me, Benjamín.

31:59.083 --> 32:00.752
You're stronger than you think,

32:00.835 --> 32:03.379
and I know you don't want
to harm your friends.

32:05.381 --> 32:07.008
But what are you thinking?

32:07.634 --> 32:08.926
What?

32:10.136 --> 32:13.181
Are you going to hide forever
at a psychiatric hospital?

32:13.264 --> 32:14.557
Please!

32:17.143 --> 32:18.686
Life goes on, Benjamín.

32:18.770 --> 32:21.689
And you have to move on,
always looking forward,

32:21.773 --> 32:23.900
like I taught you.

32:25.485 --> 32:27.070
I didn't educate you for this.

32:28.696 --> 32:30.615
Act like a man.

32:45.880 --> 32:47.715
This is a message from The Wolf.

32:50.093 --> 32:51.177
I know.

32:53.262 --> 32:54.639
But what does he want?

32:56.474 --> 33:00.019
What he's doing is using
the Packs, several of them.

33:00.978 --> 33:02.730
So that we can't build
his profile.

33:03.773 --> 33:05.316
You get it?

33:05.400 --> 33:07.318
Have you been with Petersen?

33:08.861 --> 33:10.321
Be careful.

33:12.365 --> 33:13.825
He's dangerous.

33:19.956 --> 33:21.124
Sweetie.

33:28.381 --> 33:30.216
I need to tell you something.

33:31.300 --> 33:33.428
I don't want you
to find out from TV.

33:36.723 --> 33:39.684
Somebody leaked some pictures
and videos of your sister.

33:44.731 --> 33:48.735
And the press and social media
are saying some horrible things.

34:00.413 --> 34:02.623
The video was shot
in this bedroom.

34:08.296 --> 34:09.797
Someone recorded her here.

34:17.513 --> 34:18.514
No.

34:18.598 --> 34:20.933
-OK, but listen.
-No, you listen!

34:22.727 --> 34:24.228
They sued.

34:24.312 --> 34:26.939
After the impromptu visit
to the clinic.

34:27.023 --> 34:30.401
A lawsuit against you,
and the institution.

34:32.820 --> 34:34.030
I'm sorry, it was a mistake.

34:34.113 --> 34:35.698
A mistake, you're sorry.

34:35.782 --> 34:37.200
We can say we're sorry then.

34:37.283 --> 34:38.910
Where do you think you are?

34:42.538 --> 34:43.706
What?

34:44.791 --> 34:46.167
You want me to read this shit?

34:47.502 --> 34:50.004
A network of illegal adoptions.

34:50.087 --> 34:52.423
Blanca Ibarra was a victim
of that network.

34:52.507 --> 34:54.926
And guess who's behind it all.

34:56.636 --> 34:58.846
-Tell me.
-Belmar.

34:58.930 --> 35:01.265
You're going off track, Olivia.

35:01.349 --> 35:04.268
Did you see the dates on this?
This shit is 17 years old.

35:07.021 --> 35:09.857
The calls to the Ibarra family
can't be a coincidence.

35:10.691 --> 35:13.361
It's highly likely
that there's a connection,

35:13.444 --> 35:15.863
and in any case, nothing can
be ruled out right now.

35:15.947 --> 35:17.490
You taught me that, didn't you?

35:18.533 --> 35:19.826
Come on, boss!

35:22.870 --> 35:25.915
You're understanding
absolutely nothing, Olivia.

35:25.998 --> 35:28.000
This morning I was forced to
write

35:28.084 --> 35:30.628
-my letter of resignation.
-What?

35:30.711 --> 35:33.047
The Secretary of State
has my resignation letter

35:33.130 --> 35:37.385
in his desk drawer
to make effective at any time.

35:37.468 --> 35:39.762
They want an arrest, now.

35:41.097 --> 35:44.308
And they want that girl,
alive or dead, now!

35:45.476 --> 35:47.228
There's too much pressure.

35:51.274 --> 35:53.818
If we don't find someone to
blame,

35:53.901 --> 35:55.570
we have to make some shit up

35:55.653 --> 35:57.238
to entertain the Secretary
and the press.

36:00.533 --> 36:02.243
We have to buy time.

36:03.119 --> 36:04.954
Listen to me.

36:05.037 --> 36:09.333
Time is bought far away
from those in power!

36:10.626 --> 36:11.752
I'm only interrupting

36:11.836 --> 36:13.170
because it's about
our investigation.

36:13.254 --> 36:15.590
A video of Blanca went viral
and you need to see it.

36:15.673 --> 36:16.883
I'm coming.

36:26.225 --> 36:28.311
Get away from my house!

36:39.071 --> 36:41.657
Leave your house,
make sure you're not followed.

36:50.166 --> 36:51.667
I knew, Bruno.

37:00.009 --> 37:02.470
I knew Blanca wasn't my baby.

37:09.143 --> 37:10.269
When...

37:11.979 --> 37:14.148
I woke up from labor...

37:18.235 --> 37:21.739
I felt this horrible pain.

37:25.242 --> 37:26.410
As if...

37:30.206 --> 37:32.959
As if someone had bitten my
heart.

37:36.379 --> 37:39.340
I felt, in my body...

37:44.553 --> 37:47.598
that my baby was dead.

37:52.728 --> 37:54.939
And you handed Blanca to me.

37:59.151 --> 38:00.653
I took her...

38:05.783 --> 38:07.201
And I...

38:10.162 --> 38:12.581
I touched her and...

38:14.166 --> 38:16.002
she was...

38:19.422 --> 38:21.090
nice and warm.

38:31.017 --> 38:32.560
I smelled her.

38:39.317 --> 38:41.986
And I knew I wasn't going
to give her up.

38:45.781 --> 38:46.949
Ever.

39:14.310 --> 39:18.606
Screw the police. Screw
everything, I'm going out there.

39:18.689 --> 39:20.816
What? What are you going to do?

39:20.900 --> 39:23.861
I'll give a public statement.

39:23.944 --> 39:26.155
In front of the fucking cameras,
a purge.

39:26.238 --> 39:29.241
If that's what this demon wants,
that's what he'll get.

39:29.325 --> 39:30.743
Stay here.

39:32.953 --> 39:34.121
Let's go together.

39:51.597 --> 39:53.933
Good afternoon.

39:57.144 --> 39:58.854
We're here because

39:58.938 --> 40:01.315
we want to make
a public confession.

40:02.650 --> 40:06.153
Blanca is not our biological
daughter.

40:17.581 --> 40:20.042
They're getting killed
on social media, look.

40:21.293 --> 40:24.255
"Blanca Ibarra's parents
confess illegal adoption."

40:25.131 --> 40:27.716
"Baby thieves. #Ibarrafamily."

40:28.467 --> 40:30.803
"What a shady family,
they should go to jail."

40:30.886 --> 40:33.931
"They're paying for their sins."
"How long will we allow--"

40:34.014 --> 40:36.976
Pure chaos, goddammit. Pure
chaos!

40:41.397 --> 40:43.357
Yes, but what do you want
me to do, Marcos?

40:43.440 --> 40:45.526
<i>Your job will always</i>
<i>be your priority, right?</i>

40:47.236 --> 40:49.405
-Please don't be unfair.
-<i>Right back at you.</i>

40:49.488 --> 40:50.823
<i>The girls resent you, know that?</i>

40:50.906 --> 40:53.492
<i>They ask me</i>
<i>when you're coming home.</i>

40:53.576 --> 40:55.327
<i>And I'm always here</i>
<i>as your lifeline.</i>

40:55.411 --> 40:57.204
Great, I'll take care of it, OK?

40:57.288 --> 41:00.040
I'll sort it out, thanks a ton.
Bye.

41:04.795 --> 41:07.256
Drop me off at the school
and go pick up your girls.

41:11.093 --> 41:12.511
I'm sorry.

41:12.595 --> 41:16.056
Instead of apologizing to me,
pick up Gonzalo too and feed
him.

41:16.140 --> 41:19.435
Take him home, give him a nice,
warm, yummy, home-cooked meal.

41:19.518 --> 41:21.061
I'll pick him up later.

41:22.271 --> 41:23.480
Alright.

41:25.274 --> 41:26.609
Marcos isn't wrong, though.

41:26.692 --> 41:28.152
Don't start with the guilt, OK?

41:28.235 --> 41:29.445
It's ugly, played out.

41:29.528 --> 41:31.780
It's not our job
to tear ourselves down.

41:34.450 --> 41:35.701
Thanks.

41:40.331 --> 41:43.042
Sir! What's happening?

41:56.472 --> 41:58.599
-What is it, Ramírez?
-They want in.

41:58.682 --> 42:00.100
The principal is inside
and he won't come out.

42:00.184 --> 42:02.645
-He has to be removed.
-He's hiding in his office.

42:02.728 --> 42:04.063
We don't know if he has a gun.

42:04.146 --> 42:06.357
-We'll get him out either way.
-Things could get complicated.

42:06.440 --> 42:07.608
But...

42:26.919 --> 42:28.128
Mr. Belmar.

42:29.004 --> 42:31.966
I have a judicial warrant
for your arrest

42:33.217 --> 42:37.263
for taking part in a network
of irregular adoptions

42:37.346 --> 42:40.891
operating from 1995 to 2005.

42:42.977 --> 42:46.188
Mr. Belmar, if you don't open up
and come with me to the unit,

42:46.272 --> 42:47.898
we're going to proceed with
force.

42:49.984 --> 42:52.569
After all I've done
for those children.

42:54.405 --> 42:55.698
For those families.

43:03.998 --> 43:05.291
Gonza!

43:08.419 --> 43:11.171
Hi! How are you, Dany?

43:12.047 --> 43:13.299
-How are you?
-Look.

43:13.382 --> 43:15.092
OK, come on! Come on! Get in.

43:15.175 --> 43:16.468
OK, wait.

43:27.438 --> 43:29.648
BELMAR, BABY THIEF

43:29.732 --> 43:31.942
Nasty old creep!

43:37.948 --> 43:39.199
You liar!

43:39.283 --> 43:41.577
Bye, Belmar! You're going to
jail!

43:43.203 --> 43:44.580
Abuser! Coward!

44:21.033 --> 44:22.117
Give me your name!
