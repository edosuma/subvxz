01:34.233 --> 01:35.900
Is anybody here?

01:44.000 --> 01:45.267
MR. BENTLEY: Hello!
Ahh!

01:47.167 --> 01:49.100
Mr. Bentley!

01:49.167 --> 01:50.300
What were you
doing out there?

01:50.367 --> 01:51.533
Washing the window.

01:52.067 --> 01:53.067
Why?

01:53.133 --> 01:54.400
Uh, because it was dirty.

01:54.467 --> 01:56.933
No, I mean, why were you
washing the window?

01:57.000 --> 01:59.000
That's Florence's job.

01:59.067 --> 02:02.200
I know. But I asked her,
and she was kind enough
to let me do it.

02:02.267 --> 02:04.400
She said she
had something she had
to do in her bedroom.

02:07.400 --> 02:09.933
Mmm. Nothing like
a nice long nap.

02:10.833 --> 02:13.067
Florence!

02:13.133 --> 02:14.667
I sure wish I had
time to take one.

02:16.767 --> 02:20.467
Florence, why was
Mr. Bentley cleaning
our windows?

02:20.533 --> 02:22.133
'Cause he hates
watching soap operas.

02:23.367 --> 02:24.533
What?

02:24.600 --> 02:27.433
Yes, unfortunately
Felicia loves them.

02:27.500 --> 02:28.500
Felicia?

02:28.567 --> 02:31.267
Oh, your house guest.

02:31.333 --> 02:32.333
Is she still here?

02:32.400 --> 02:34.167
Oh, I'm afraid so.

02:34.233 --> 02:35.700
Oh, it must be two weeks...

02:35.767 --> 02:38.367
And 11 hours and 13 minutes.

02:40.433 --> 02:43.433
You never told us why
she's staying with you
in the first place.

02:43.500 --> 02:47.233
Oh, she just turned up on
my doorstep, and I said
something terrible.

02:47.300 --> 02:48.400
Well, what did you say?

02:48.467 --> 02:49.467
I said, "Come in."

02:51.600 --> 02:53.833
Now can't you say, "Get out"?

02:53.900 --> 02:55.500
Oh, I wish I could, but

02:55.567 --> 02:59.467
Felicia's the only
daughter of my mother's
best friend's sister.

02:59.533 --> 03:02.800
Or, is she the only
sister of my mother's
best friend's daughter? Or...

liberty of putting
the kettle on for tea.

Poor Mr. Bentley.
That girl must be
driving him crazy.

03:13.467 --> 03:15.200
Well, for him,
it's a very short drive.

He's over here all the time,
and now he's even
doing your housework.

Yeah. Ain't that terrible?

Tea and cakes.

(GASPS) Well, there you are.
Harry, honestly,

03:49.533 --> 03:51.833
you spend more time
over here than you
do at your own place.

03:51.900 --> 03:54.233
Why, if I didn't know
any better, I'd think you were
trying to avoid me.

03:54.300 --> 03:56.400
But luckily, I know better.

03:56.467 --> 03:59.100
-Felicia...
-Harry, I must tell you,
must tell you about this

ridiculous new character
they've introduced
on this soap opera.

-Felicia...
-She just keeps talking
on, and on, and on,

04:04.400 --> 04:06.400
and won't let anyone
else get a word in edgewise.

04:06.467 --> 04:07.467
Felicia...

04:07.533 --> 04:08.500
Harry, I'm talking.

04:10.167 --> 04:12.733
I'm sorry.
Uh, would you care
for some tea?

04:12.800 --> 04:14.200
Well, not now, Harry.

04:14.267 --> 04:16.367
We'll miss the second half
of the soap opera.

04:16.433 --> 04:20.300
Sorry to dash. We simply
must have another nice
chat real soon. (LAUGHS)

04:24.700 --> 04:26.967
England sure must
be quiet with her
out of the country.

(DOORBELL RINGS)

04:37.400 --> 04:39.433
Oh, may I borrow
a box of tissues?

04:39.500 --> 04:42.367
Felicia will be needing them
to dry her eyes.

04:42.433 --> 04:44.167
Oh, you're going to
ask her to leave?

04:44.233 --> 04:47.000
Oh, no. She just takes
her soap opera very seriously.

04:48.333 --> 04:49.667
I'll get the tissues for...

04:49.733 --> 04:51.967
Oh, it's all right, Mrs. J,
I know right where they are.

05:00.200 --> 05:02.000
George, what are you doing?
Just checking.

05:03.400 --> 05:05.300
Good, he ain't here.
Who?

05:05.367 --> 05:07.133
Bentley.
You called?

05:07.200 --> 05:09.467
Damn! You here again?

05:09.533 --> 05:11.133
Oh, it would seem so.

05:11.200 --> 05:12.200
Why don't you just move in?

05:12.267 --> 05:13.200
Oh, I'd love to.

05:13.267 --> 05:14.333
Look, I didn't mean that.

05:14.400 --> 05:16.233
Oh, but you just said...

05:16.300 --> 05:18.033
Forget what I just said,
and listen to what I'm
gonna say. Goodbye.

Look, Weezy, I got
problems of my own.

And one of them
is Phil Rawlins.

05:28.900 --> 05:30.100

05:30.167 --> 05:32.533
Yeah, he wants me
to hire his son Bobby.

05:32.600 --> 05:34.600
I thought his son
worked for him.

05:34.667 --> 05:39.133
He does, but Bobby is so dumb
Rawlins wants to get him out
of his business and into mine.

you like standing in

I'll get back to you, okay?

That does it, Bentley.

our phone and almost
blew an account for me.

Let's face it.

As long as Felicia is
visiting Mr. Bentley,
he's going to be visiting us.

07:03.900 --> 07:05.867
Oh...
She's right, you know.

07:05.933 --> 07:08.800
Look, Bentley, if you don't
like this Felicia, why don't
you just tell her to get lost?

07:08.867 --> 07:11.967
Oh, I wish I could,
but my mother would
never forgive me.

07:12.033 --> 07:13.633
What's your mother
gotta do with it?

07:13.700 --> 07:17.000
Oh, Felicia's the
daughter of my mother's
best friend's sister.

07:17.067 --> 07:20.433
Or is she the sister
of my mother's best
friend's son...

07:20.500 --> 07:23.633
Look, Bentley, whatever
she is, all you gotta do
is start an argument with her,

07:23.700 --> 07:25.067
and she'll get mad and leave.

07:25.133 --> 07:27.300
Well, I'm not very good
at starting arguments.

07:27.367 --> 07:30.367
It's easy.
Whatever she says,
you just say the opposite.

07:30.433 --> 07:32.267
Oh, do you really
think that would work?

07:32.333 --> 07:36.600
Mr. Bentley, if there's
one thing George knows,
it's how to start an argument.

07:38.200 --> 07:42.467
I see. So whatever
Felicia says, I just
say the opposite, eh?

07:42.533 --> 07:43.600
I think I've got it.

07:43.667 --> 07:44.733
Oh, hi.

everything that's happened.

And then we can
look at my slides of
the Welsh countryside.

and Mrs. Jefferson would like
to look at my slides, too!

-Have you ever seen
pictures of Wales?

such fine friends.

Oh, no, I'm just
surprised to see
you wearing pants,

08:28.600 --> 08:30.800
knowing how Bentley
feels about women in pants.

08:30.867 --> 08:33.933
Oh, really? How do you
feel about that, Harry?

08:34.000 --> 08:36.400
I'm, um...

08:36.467 --> 08:40.033
He thinks only men
should wear pants.
Right, Bentley?

08:40.100 --> 08:42.700
Oh, yeah, that's right.
Yes, that's
exactly what I think.

08:42.767 --> 08:44.433
Yes, I, I feel
that very strongly.

08:44.500 --> 08:46.833
Oh? Why shouldn't
women wear pants?

08:46.900 --> 08:48.567
Well, because...

08:48.633 --> 08:50.433
(WHISPERS) Why shouldn't
women wear pants?

08:50.500 --> 08:52.200
Oh, come on, Bentley.

08:52.267 --> 08:53.767
You're both English.

08:53.833 --> 08:55.700
Did you ever
see the Queen
without a dress on?

08:55.767 --> 08:57.267

Oh, Mr. J,
I've never even
been in the palace.

09:01.100 --> 09:02.933
That's what I mean.

09:03.000 --> 09:05.200
You don't see the
Queen running around
acting like she's the King.

09:05.267 --> 09:06.600
Oh, no, she'd never do that.

09:06.667 --> 09:08.367
No, I agree.

09:08.433 --> 09:10.567
-(QUIETLY) You're not
supposed to agree!
-I disagree.

09:10.633 --> 09:12.100
With what?
I don't know.

09:14.133 --> 09:16.000
Oh, my goodness,

09:16.067 --> 09:18.933
is that roast beef I smell,
Mrs. Jefferson?

09:19.000 --> 09:21.267
Why, yes.
We're having it for dinner.

09:21.333 --> 09:22.833
Oh, I simply must
have a sample.

09:22.900 --> 09:24.133
Do you mind?

09:24.200 --> 09:25.633
Well, as a matter of fact...
Thank you.

09:25.700 --> 09:27.200
Roast beef is definitely
one of my favorite dishes.

09:27.267 --> 09:29.700
Yes, my uncle Andrew
owns a pub in
the North Country...

09:29.767 --> 09:31.767
I know just the thing,
with roast beef and
Yorkshire pudding.

09:34.167 --> 09:37.633
She talks so much
I'm surprised she has
time to breathe.

09:40.167 --> 09:41.733
I don't understand you,
Bentley.

09:41.800 --> 09:43.800
All you did was
agree with her.

09:43.867 --> 09:45.467
That's your problem.
You're too agreeable.

09:45.533 --> 09:47.767
I agree.
See? You did it again.

09:47.833 --> 09:52.000
I'm sorry, Mr. J. I just
don't seem to have it in me
to be intentionally mean.

09:52.067 --> 09:55.833
Bentley, the nicest people
have a mean streak in 'em.

09:55.900 --> 09:56.900
Even me.

09:58.833 --> 10:00.800
Just tell her to get out
of your apartment!

10:00.867 --> 10:01.967
I couldn't do that.

10:02.033 --> 10:03.233
Well, I sure could!

10:03.300 --> 10:04.933
You could?
Oh, thank you, Mr. J!

10:05.000 --> 10:06.933
Hey, hey.
Hey, hey, hey...

10:07.000 --> 10:10.033
Finally I'll be able to
get off the couch and
back into my own bed.

10:10.100 --> 10:11.167
Wait a minute...

10:11.233 --> 10:12.233
And, with Felicia gone,

10:12.300 --> 10:15.367
I won't be spending
as much time over here.

10:15.433 --> 10:17.000
Oh, okay.

10:17.067 --> 10:20.167
Sure, Bentley.
You wait right here.
I'll handle it for you.

10:20.233 --> 10:24.100
Ah, but, Mr. J,
please be gentle with her.

10:24.167 --> 10:28.133
And my aunt Elaine
used to make the most
wonderful kidney pie.

10:28.200 --> 10:29.633
She would use...
Felicia!

10:29.700 --> 10:31.333
Mr. Jefferson, I'm talking.

10:31.400 --> 10:35.167
Oh, that's all right.
I can hear about your
aunt's kidneys later.

10:35.967 --> 10:37.967
Felicia,

10:39.567 --> 10:42.867
(CLEARS THROAT) now,
Bentley is a real nice guy.

10:42.933 --> 10:44.500
He certainly is.

10:44.567 --> 10:45.567
(CHUCKLES)

10:48.333 --> 10:52.067
And, uh, sometimes
he finds it hard to say
what's really on his mind.

10:52.133 --> 10:53.133
Dig?

10:53.533 --> 10:54.733
Dig?

10:54.800 --> 10:56.733
Uh, you understand?

10:56.800 --> 10:59.000
Oh, yes.

10:59.067 --> 11:02.100
Now, you've been staying
at his place for two weeks.

11:02.167 --> 11:04.467
Now, that's a long
time for two people to
be staying together,

11:04.533 --> 11:06.167
unless they're married
like Weezy and me.

11:06.233 --> 11:08.367
Oh, and you two
seem so happy.

11:08.433 --> 11:10.600
That's because we
love each other.

11:10.667 --> 11:13.733
And when two people
love each other, it's easy
for them to live together.

11:13.800 --> 11:15.767
But when one has to
sleep on the sofa,

11:15.833 --> 11:17.100
that ain't no good. Dig?

11:17.633 --> 11:18.633
Dug.

11:20.433 --> 11:22.500
Uh-huh. So, anyway,

11:22.567 --> 11:24.900
what Bentley has been
trying to tell you is
that he thinks it's time

11:24.967 --> 11:26.933
that you had
a permanent home.

11:28.533 --> 11:31.300
A permanent home?

11:31.367 --> 11:32.800
Yeah, you know...

11:32.867 --> 11:34.700
Oh, Harry!

11:34.767 --> 11:37.667
Well, why didn't you just
tell me how you felt?

11:37.733 --> 11:39.000
Oh, please don't cry.

11:39.067 --> 11:40.300
Oh, my God, Harry,

11:40.367 --> 11:42.567
I always cry when I'm happy.

11:42.633 --> 11:44.433
I know. Happy?

11:44.500 --> 11:46.267
Oh, yes.

11:46.333 --> 11:48.367
You sweet shy thing.

11:48.433 --> 11:52.300
Getting Mr. Jefferson
to propose for you!

11:53.333 --> 11:54.700
(SQUEALS OF EXCITEMENT)

11:54.767 --> 11:56.967
Propose?

11:57.033 --> 11:59.300
Propose. Yes.
And I accept.

11:59.367 --> 12:01.833
Oh, we're going to have
a marvelous life together.

12:01.900 --> 12:03.067
Together?

12:03.133 --> 12:06.033
Oh, oh...

12:06.100 --> 12:08.633
I'm so excited.
This is the happiest
day of my life.

12:08.700 --> 12:11.367
Oh, we must ring up Mother
and tell her the good news...

12:11.433 --> 12:13.833
(SQUEAL OF EXCITEMENT)

12:14.700 --> 12:16.333
(GIDDY LAUGHTER)

12:24.467 --> 12:25.467
But...

12:36.400 --> 12:39.967
George, what on earth
did you tell Felicia?

12:40.033 --> 12:42.967
I thought I told her
to pack her bags and get out.

12:43.033 --> 12:44.933
But she thinks
she's getting married!

12:45.000 --> 12:46.433
I know. That's the
trouble with the English.

12:46.500 --> 12:49.167
They don't
understand English.

12:49.233 --> 12:51.900
Well, I should
have been firm with her
from the very start.

12:51.967 --> 12:53.833
Right, Bentley.

12:53.900 --> 12:54.900
I should have told her I
didn't want her
staying with me.

12:54.967 --> 12:56.967
Right, Bentley.

12:57.033 --> 12:59.433
And I should go over
there right now and tell her
we are not getting married!

12:59.500 --> 13:00.567
Right, Bentley.
Go do it!

13:00.633 --> 13:01.667
I can't!

13:02.867 --> 13:04.167
Bentley...

13:04.233 --> 13:06.000
What's going on?

13:06.067 --> 13:09.200
Felicia thinks Mr. Bentley
wants to marry her.

13:09.267 --> 13:11.533
Where did she ever get a
dumb idea like that?

13:16.600 --> 13:18.367
Oh, direct from the factory.

13:25.233 --> 13:27.367
Look, Florence, we don't need
your two cents.

13:27.433 --> 13:28.800
You need all the
sense you can get.

13:33.833 --> 13:35.400
Oh, what am I going to do?

13:35.467 --> 13:39.167
I can't marry Felicia, and I
can't break her heart.

13:39.233 --> 13:41.400
Well, I hope you
think of something.
See you later.

13:41.467 --> 13:43.833
Hold on, buster.

13:43.900 --> 13:47.467
You got Mr. Bentley
into this mess, now it's
up to you to get him out.

13:47.533 --> 13:51.300
Oh, no, Mrs. J,
you shouldn't ask
Mr. J to do that for me.

13:51.367 --> 13:54.167
-He's right.
-I should.
Oh, Mr. J, please.

13:54.233 --> 13:56.033
I'll be your friend forever.

13:56.100 --> 13:58.200
Yeah, that's what
I'm afraid of.

13:58.267 --> 14:02.233
You go on over there and
tell Felicia that Mr. Bentley
does not want to marry her.

14:03.200 --> 14:04.367
Ugh.

14:04.433 --> 14:05.733
Okay, Weezy.
Come on, Bentley.

14:05.800 --> 14:08.300
Oh, no, no. I can't
be there when you
break the news.

14:08.367 --> 14:10.400
I hate it when a
grown-up cries.

14:10.467 --> 14:11.633
Oh, she'll be all right.

14:11.700 --> 14:12.833
Not her. Me.

14:12.900 --> 14:14.633
Oh, Bentley!

14:14.700 --> 14:17.033
-Ah-ha.
-Oh, excuse me.
Oh, Harry, I'm so happy!

14:17.100 --> 14:20.067
Mother was beside herself
when I told her.

14:20.133 --> 14:22.667
Why, it's just too
wonderful to be true,
isn't it, Harry darling?

14:22.733 --> 14:27.000
Who would have imagined it
two weeks ago when
I popped up on your door.

14:27.067 --> 14:30.533
Oh, I feel like I'm dreaming.

14:30.600 --> 14:31.600
So do I.

14:33.467 --> 14:37.200
And, Mr. Jefferson,
I'm so grateful for
what you've done.

14:37.267 --> 14:39.067
Why if it hadn't
been for you putting
into words what

14:39.133 --> 14:42.167
Harry felt inside,
why our love may never
have blossomed.

14:42.233 --> 14:45.767
Oh, that's quite a husband
you've got there,
Mrs. Jefferson.

14:45.833 --> 14:48.200
I know.

14:48.267 --> 14:50.933
And I think there's
something else he
wants to tell you.

14:51.000 --> 14:52.333
Isn't there, George?

14:53.167 --> 14:54.700
Oh, yeah, uh, um, Felicia...

14:54.767 --> 14:56.600
Mr. J, not here. Please.

14:56.667 --> 14:57.833
Oh, why not?

14:57.900 --> 14:59.433
What did you
have to tell me?

14:59.500 --> 15:00.500
Uh...

15:01.367 --> 15:02.633
Just that I'm happy for you.

15:05.167 --> 15:06.533
Thanks awfully.

15:06.600 --> 15:08.433
And of course, you'll be
Harry's best man,

15:08.500 --> 15:10.600
and Mrs. Jefferson,
you can be my...

15:10.667 --> 15:13.767
In fact, I'm so happy for you
I wanna take you down to
Charley's bar to celebrate.

15:13.833 --> 15:14.933
Oh, well...

15:15.000 --> 15:16.900
It's a tradition.

15:16.967 --> 15:18.433
The best man always
takes the bride-to-be
out for a drink.

15:18.500 --> 15:20.433
Oh, but, Harry,
can't you come along?

15:20.500 --> 15:23.167
Uh, no, no. It's bad luck for
the groom to see the bride
in a bar before the wedding.

15:23.233 --> 15:24.833
Oh, but I never heard
of such a thing!

15:24.900 --> 15:27.900
Well, when in America,
do as the Americans do.

15:36.033 --> 15:37.267
(FELICIA LAUGHS LOUDLY)

15:37.333 --> 15:39.800
Oh, Mr. Jefferson...

15:39.867 --> 15:40.867
Oh, allow me.

15:40.933 --> 15:42.933
Oh, why, thank you.

15:43.600 --> 15:44.800
Oh! (LAUGHS)

15:50.167 --> 15:51.800
Hey, Mr. Jefferson,
what'll it be?

15:51.867 --> 15:53.667
Hey, Charley,
you got any champagne?

15:53.733 --> 15:57.133
Why sure, sure. Always
keep a couple of bottles
around for special occasions.

15:57.200 --> 15:58.467
What's your special occasion?

15:58.533 --> 16:00.333
I gotta call off a marriage.

16:00.933 --> 16:01.967
What?

16:02.033 --> 16:03.533
Oh, Mr. Jefferson, I'm sorry.

16:03.600 --> 16:04.733
I mean, that's rough.

16:04.800 --> 16:06.567
Ain't it?

16:06.633 --> 16:09.167
Yeah, I mean, I always thought
that you and Mrs. Jefferson
seemed so happy.

16:09.233 --> 16:12.867
We are happy. And I'll be
even happier when you get
me the champagne.

16:12.933 --> 16:13.933
Sure.

16:17.333 --> 16:19.033
What a charming place.

16:19.100 --> 16:20.933
Felicia...
We have a pub back home

16:21.000 --> 16:22.700
much like this.
Oh yeah? Felicia...

16:22.767 --> 16:24.867
Except the bar is
over there, and then
there are drapes...

16:24.933 --> 16:26.700
-Yeah, Felicia...
-There are little tables
outside in the summer...

16:26.767 --> 16:28.700
Felicia, about you and
Bentley getting married...

16:28.767 --> 16:31.100
Ah, yes, isn't it wonderful?

16:31.167 --> 16:33.533
Frankly, I was a bit surprised
by the proposal.

16:34.900 --> 16:36.433
Yeah, you're not the only one.

16:36.500 --> 16:37.833
Pardon?

16:37.900 --> 16:40.267
Oh, I mean, Bentley
was surprised you accepted.

16:40.333 --> 16:42.833
Oh, but Harry is so cute.
How could I refuse him?

16:42.900 --> 16:44.733
Well, you haven't
known him that long.

16:44.800 --> 16:46.167
I mean,
marriage is a big step.

16:46.233 --> 16:48.233
Oh, and it's a step
I am ready to take.

16:48.300 --> 16:51.200
(CHUCKLES) I wouldn't
be so sure about that.

16:51.267 --> 16:52.733
There's a lot of
things about Bentley
you don't know.

16:52.800 --> 16:54.833
Oh? Like what?

16:54.900 --> 16:57.633
Well, uh, like he's
got a bad back.

16:57.700 --> 16:59.533
It's always
going out on him.

16:59.600 --> 17:01.167
You'd probably have to
walk on it for him.

17:01.233 --> 17:03.300
Oh, how romantic.

17:05.433 --> 17:08.067
Oh, uh, and he ain't got
no kind of sense of humor.

17:08.133 --> 17:09.667
I mean, he don't even
laugh at my jokes.

17:09.733 --> 17:11.067
Really?

17:11.133 --> 17:12.933
Like the other day I
said to him, I said,

17:13.000 --> 17:15.267
"How can you tell when
an elephant's been in
your refrigerator?"

17:16.133 --> 17:17.500
How can you tell?

17:17.567 --> 17:18.933
You can see his
footprints in the butter.

17:26.167 --> 17:28.833
How on earth would
an elephant get in
a refrigerator?

17:31.133 --> 17:32.967
Well, you, you see, um...

17:33.933 --> 17:35.100
Well, never mind.

17:35.167 --> 17:36.467
Oh, Mr. Jefferson,

17:36.533 --> 17:39.467
I'm sure Harry and I
will get along swimmingly.

17:39.533 --> 17:41.733
Yeah, but what if
he loses his job?

17:41.800 --> 17:42.967
Then you'll have
to support him.

17:43.033 --> 17:45.533
Oh, I never worry
about things like that.

17:45.600 --> 17:47.467
The three of us will
manage somehow.

17:47.533 --> 17:48.933
Yeah, I know, but...

17:49.000 --> 17:50.000
The three of you?

17:50.067 --> 17:52.900
Why yes.
Harry and myself and...

17:52.967 --> 17:55.100
Well, Baby will
be along soon.

17:56.000 --> 17:57.000
Baby!

17:59.100 --> 18:00.467
Does Bentley
know about that?

18:00.533 --> 18:03.133
Well, I'm sure it
won't be a big surprise.

18:04.067 --> 18:05.067
What!

18:06.500 --> 18:08.600
He didn't tell me
nothing about that.

18:08.667 --> 18:10.133
Wait till I get
my hands on him!

18:10.667 --> 18:11.667
What!

18:15.233 --> 18:16.567
What happened with
Mr. Jefferson?

18:16.633 --> 18:18.367
Well, I haven't the foggiest.

18:18.433 --> 18:21.800
I simply mentioned
that I was having my cat
sent here from England and...

18:21.867 --> 18:23.233
Oh, your cat.

18:23.300 --> 18:24.600
Oh, yes. This is Baby.

18:24.667 --> 18:26.633
My pet Siamese.
Oh, very cute.

18:26.700 --> 18:29.500
Oh, I miss her so much.
She usually goes
everywhere with me.

18:29.567 --> 18:31.167
Why, once I went on a
cycling holiday,

18:31.233 --> 18:33.800
and she traveled every
single mile with me.

18:33.867 --> 18:36.033
I remember one time,
right outside of Brighton,

18:36.100 --> 18:38.033
she was traveling in the
little basket in the
handlebars...

18:38.100 --> 18:39.767
-On the handlebars?
-...and she started
breathing terribly.

18:39.833 --> 18:43.267
You got all wet, didn't you,
my darling baby?

18:43.333 --> 18:46.367
Then you remember what
Mommy did? Mommy wrapped you
in a nice soft towel and...

18:52.100 --> 18:53.433
George, did you do it?

18:53.500 --> 18:55.033
No. But Bentley did.

18:57.000 --> 18:58.833
I did what?
You know what you did.

18:58.900 --> 19:01.700
And what you did you
shouldn't have done, 'cause
you told me you didn't do it!

19:02.633 --> 19:04.267
Did what?
Oh...

19:04.333 --> 19:06.233
George, what are
you talking about?

19:06.300 --> 19:07.733
Bentley lied to me.

19:07.800 --> 19:09.367
Lied? Oh, Mr. J...

19:09.433 --> 19:10.867
Don't "Mr. J" me.

19:10.933 --> 19:12.333
You told me that
you was sleeping
on the couch,

19:12.400 --> 19:13.733
and Felicia was sleeping
in the bedroom.

19:13.800 --> 19:15.867
That's right.

19:15.933 --> 19:17.667
Oh, yeah? Well, either
you're lying or one of
you all is sleepwalking.

19:20.333 --> 19:22.867
George, what
are you saying?

19:22.933 --> 19:25.800
I'm saying Felicia is
gonna have a baby.

19:25.867 --> 19:27.333
IN UNISON: A baby!

19:34.433 --> 19:35.900
George, are you sure?

19:35.967 --> 19:38.367
You damn right I'm sure.
Felicia told me herself.

19:39.267 --> 19:41.133
But how could that
have happened?

19:41.200 --> 19:43.500
Look, Bentley,
you might be dumb,
but you ain't that dumb.

19:45.700 --> 19:47.367
(DOORBELL RINGS)

19:47.433 --> 19:48.467
Shoot!

19:48.533 --> 19:51.033
Mr. Bentley, are you
telling us everything?

19:51.100 --> 19:54.667
Of course, Mrs. J.
Felicia and I have
never even held hands.

19:54.733 --> 19:57.067
Look, what she's got,
you don't get
from holding hands.

19:59.067 --> 20:01.267
Oh, Mr. Jefferson,
here you are.

20:01.333 --> 20:03.367
Why you certainly
left in a hurry.

20:03.433 --> 20:05.567
Oh, yeah. Well, I just
came home to talk to
Bentley about something.

20:05.633 --> 20:07.600
Oh, really?
What was that, Harry?

20:07.667 --> 20:11.633
Uh, Mr. Jefferson
was just telling
me about your baby.

20:11.700 --> 20:15.633
Oh. And I wanted to tell you
that myself, Harry.

20:15.700 --> 20:16.700
Who's the father?

20:17.267 --> 20:18.267
Who knows?

20:22.433 --> 20:23.833
But what does it matter?

20:23.900 --> 20:25.400
It matters plenty if it
ain't Bentley's!

20:25.467 --> 20:28.667
Oh, but after we're married,
it'll be both of ours.

20:28.733 --> 20:30.833
It will?
Oh, certainly.

20:30.900 --> 20:32.800
You can take Baby on a walk
whenever you want.

20:32.867 --> 20:37.133
-I can?
-Oh, come now, Harry.
Baby won't be any trouble.

20:37.200 --> 20:38.967
She can take care
of herself.

20:39.033 --> 20:41.167
She can?
Of course.

20:41.233 --> 20:43.800
Well, how do you
know it's a she?

20:43.867 --> 20:45.333
Oh, there are lots
of ways to tell.

20:47.100 --> 20:48.267
There are?

20:48.333 --> 20:51.333
Uh, Felicia, when are you
expecting your baby?

20:51.400 --> 20:53.233
Any day now.

21:00.700 --> 21:02.800
Any day!

21:02.867 --> 21:04.933
But how are you hiding it?

21:05.000 --> 21:06.767
Well, I'm not hiding it.

21:06.833 --> 21:09.000
I simply left her
with the veterinarian.

21:09.633 --> 21:11.167
Veterinarian!

21:12.333 --> 21:14.567
Yes, he specializes in cats.

21:14.633 --> 21:15.867
Cats?

21:15.933 --> 21:18.267
You mean your
baby is a cat?

21:18.333 --> 21:20.633
Yes, that's Baby.
My pet Siamese.

21:21.867 --> 21:24.000
Then you're not
having a real baby?

21:26.267 --> 21:27.267
A real baby?

21:27.333 --> 21:28.333
(SHRIEKS WITH LAUGHTER)

21:30.733 --> 21:32.700
Oh, heavens no.

21:34.067 --> 21:35.967
That won't come till
after we're married.

21:38.333 --> 21:40.733
A cat!
George thought you...

21:40.800 --> 21:42.600
Never mind what
George thought.

21:44.867 --> 21:47.900
Oh, I can hardly wait
till Baby's here.

21:47.967 --> 21:51.133
The three of us are
going to be so happy,
won't we, Harry?

21:51.200 --> 21:53.833
Now, we've got to
start making those
wedding arrangements.

21:55.200 --> 21:57.067
Mr. J, do something...

21:57.133 --> 21:58.567
Hey, Felicia, there's
something Bentley
hasn't told you.

21:58.633 --> 22:00.300
Well, it can wait.
No, it can't.

22:00.367 --> 22:02.333
Bentley's allergic to cats.
Right, Bentley?

22:02.400 --> 22:06.200
Oh, yes, that's right.
I sneeze uncontrollably
whenever a cat is near.

22:08.133 --> 22:09.433
His eyes get all puffy.

22:09.500 --> 22:11.467
Uh, yes,
sometimes I run a fever.

22:11.533 --> 22:13.233
That's right.
Bentley can't stand cats.

22:13.300 --> 22:15.200
Can't stand cats!

22:16.767 --> 22:19.467
What kind of a man are you?

22:21.600 --> 22:22.633
A dog man?

22:27.367 --> 22:28.367
Woof.

22:31.233 --> 22:34.067
Well, Felicia, you got a
big decision to make.

22:34.133 --> 22:36.833
What's it gonna be?
Your cat or Bentley?

22:42.900 --> 22:44.767
Of course, I'm housebroken.

22:50.167 --> 22:51.833
So is Baby.

22:53.000 --> 22:54.000
I don't shed on the sofa.

22:54.067 --> 22:55.400
Bentley...

22:55.467 --> 22:57.300
I, I mean, I do
shed on the sofa.

22:59.833 --> 23:03.100
I'm afraid that
any man who can't
be around cats,

23:03.967 --> 23:06.433
can't be around me.

23:06.500 --> 23:09.933
Now, I hate to break your
heart like this, but I'm
sure you'll get over it.

23:10.000 --> 23:14.400
Well, I'm packing my bags
and going home to Baby.

23:14.467 --> 23:15.467
Ta, ta!

23:22.433 --> 23:24.533
IN UNISON: Ta, ta!

23:33.133 --> 23:36.300
* Born free...

23:36.367 --> 23:40.400
Oh, Mr. J, at last
I'm free to go home
to my own apartment.

23:43.800 --> 23:45.467
Yes, isn't it wonderful?

23:45.533 --> 23:47.200
It's wonderful.

23:47.267 --> 23:50.933
* As free as
the wind blows... *

23:51.000 --> 23:53.100
Bentley, ain't it
time you went to bed?

23:53.167 --> 23:55.467
Oh, you are absolutely right.

23:57.300 --> 23:58.467
Good night.

24:32.667 --> 24:35.300
LOUISE: The Jeffersons was
videotaped in front of
a studio audience.

24:37.700 --> 24:39.300
* Movin', movin' on up
