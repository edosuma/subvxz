00:01.543 --> 00:03.712
"Therapy For Today is a convenient way

00:03.712 --> 00:06.756
"to make sure you're getting
the help you need.

00:06.756 --> 00:10.719
"After all, mental health,
it's something you do for you.

00:10.719 --> 00:13.680
Promo code: ZoomShrink@SexAndTheCity."

00:13.680 --> 00:16.599
Done. And the last one. Sammi?

00:17.142 --> 00:18.059
<i>Ready.</i>

00:20.395 --> 00:23.648
"This is for all my listeners
with a vagina.

00:23.648 --> 00:26.609
Ever feel not quite right down there?"

00:27.318 --> 00:33.116
Okay. I'm feeling not quite right up here.
What is this?

00:33.116 --> 00:35.160
It's an ad for a vaginal wellness product.

00:35.160 --> 00:36.786
- Yeah, no, I got that part right away.
- Did you?

00:36.786 --> 00:39.247
But, "Down there"?

00:40.123 --> 00:41.207
Why is it underlined?

00:41.207 --> 00:43.793
What, just to make it
more awkward and obvious?

00:43.793 --> 00:45.420
Well, mission accomplished.

00:46.212 --> 00:47.213
Oh, my God.

00:47.213 --> 00:50.300
"But with our vaginal
odor suppositories..."

00:50.675 --> 00:54.971
I have spent my entire life
going out of my way to never

00:54.971 --> 01:00.060
say the word "suppository."
And now, it's coupled with "vagina."

01:00.060 --> 01:01.436
- Wait. No, no, no, no, no, no.
- Certainly is.

01:01.436 --> 01:02.812
Oh, my God, again.

01:02.812 --> 01:06.066
"Promo code: VagAndTheCity."

01:06.066 --> 01:08.318
- Come-- I can't.
- I'll let 'em know.

01:08.318 --> 01:10.570
- Okay, thank you.
- Let's just do the show.

01:10.570 --> 01:12.113
- Let's do the show.
- Yeah.

01:24.584 --> 01:27.420
- Ready to be blown?
- Am I ever.

01:29.881 --> 01:32.926
How is your romance? How is your man?

01:32.926 --> 01:34.719
Turns out, not my man.

01:34.719 --> 01:37.138
Done. <i>Finito.</i> Too many red flags.

01:37.138 --> 01:39.391
You're always finding red flags.

01:39.391 --> 01:41.685
This one this, that one that.

01:41.685 --> 01:43.520
He still lives with his ex-wife.

01:43.520 --> 01:47.023
Do you know how many mens I dated
who still lives with their wives?

01:47.023 --> 01:50.193
- You are too picky.
- I have my standards.

01:50.193 --> 01:52.362
Listen to you. Standards.

01:52.362 --> 01:56.908
You sit in my chairs for 10 years
with your red flags and standards.

01:56.908 --> 01:59.244
No wonder you're still alone.

02:01.371 --> 02:03.039
Oh. <i>Dios mio.</i>

02:05.041 --> 02:08.253
- I am not done.
- I am. Forever.

02:09.713 --> 02:11.798
I pay you to blow me, not shrink me.

02:26.062 --> 02:29.357
Ah, shit. That's my show-writer calling.

02:29.357 --> 02:32.152
- I have to take this.
- I'm doin' some of my best work here.

02:32.152 --> 02:33.486
Well, go to the head of the class.

02:36.823 --> 02:37.699
Good morning, BD.

02:37.699 --> 02:41.411
Oh, is it?
'Cause the network hates the new pages.

02:41.411 --> 02:42.662
Can you be here by 10?

02:44.122 --> 02:47.751
- Okay, in an hour?
- No, 10 o'clock tonight.

02:47.751 --> 02:50.754
Okay, well, do you have any other time?

02:50.754 --> 02:54.883
No, 'cause today's therapy day
and my parents are here.

02:54.883 --> 02:56.259
Not coincidental.

02:57.302 --> 02:59.471
- Oh, shit!
- Precisely.

02:59.471 --> 03:01.431
- So you gonna be here?
- I guess I can make it.

03:01.431 --> 03:04.017
This isn't a favor. It's your fucking job!

03:04.893 --> 03:07.562
Okay, that was so not cool.

03:08.688 --> 03:10.774
It was hot, but it was not cool.

03:10.774 --> 03:12.400
I'll take hot.

03:12.400 --> 03:15.028
Okay. Wait. No, no. Oh, God.

03:15.028 --> 03:18.490
1 need, I need to meet with this writer.
I am so sorry.

03:18.490 --> 03:20.200
Will you be okay all day?

03:20.200 --> 03:21.743
Don't worry about me.

03:21.743 --> 03:24.496
I'll just find someone else
to practice giving head to.

03:24.496 --> 03:29.292
Trust. I don't wanna leave,
but this is important.

03:29.751 --> 03:31.878
The script is getting so cute
it's turning into

03:31.878 --> 03:33.380
"You're a Good Queer, Charlie Brown."

03:35.590 --> 03:37.384
It's so weird.

03:37.384 --> 03:39.969
The writer can't seem to wrap their head
around my few realism notes,

03:39.969 --> 03:42.931
but can wrap their head around Tony Danza
as my Mexican father.

03:44.140 --> 03:48.937
Till next time, I'm Carrie Bradshaw
and this is "Sex and the City."

03:48.937 --> 03:50.480
<i>Great!</i>

03:50.480 --> 03:52.440
I'm pregnant, I have to pee,
and I only have a minute.

03:52.440 --> 03:54.234
Why won't you talk about your vagina?

03:55.735 --> 03:58.321
For so many reasons.
And to be clear, it's not my vagina.

03:58.321 --> 04:00.198
It's everyone's vagina.

04:00.198 --> 04:02.200
- And hello.
- Hello, diva.

04:02.200 --> 04:03.827
I am not a diva.

04:03.827 --> 04:06.287
I did the therapy, I did the eyelashes.

04:06.287 --> 04:08.707
I held up that vegan purse on Instagram.

04:08.707 --> 04:11.501
My other purses still won't speak to me.

04:11.835 --> 04:14.295
- Hey, what's up, Chloe?
- Just trying to save

04:14.295 --> 04:16.506
this flaming Viking ship from sinking.

04:16.923 --> 04:20.593
Would you tell your star
it is not the podcast heyday of 2021?

04:20.593 --> 04:22.887
- This shit is drying up.
- We're just looking to have

04:22.887 --> 04:25.056
a conversation about that one ad.

04:25.056 --> 04:27.308
When I gave the vaginal
wellness commercial

04:27.308 --> 04:30.145
to the guy who does the car podcast,
do you know what he said?

04:30.145 --> 04:32.480
"This is inappropriate, Chloe"?

04:32.480 --> 04:36.776
On air, he said,
"My wife suffers from vaginal dryness,"

04:36.776 --> 04:38.570
and he's not even married.

04:38.570 --> 04:42.741
- Dude is here for us.
- I am, I am here for us,

04:42.741 --> 04:47.078
but no one,
no human being speaks like that.

04:47.078 --> 04:48.705
Well, then rewrite the fucker.

04:48.705 --> 04:51.082
Pretend like you're talking
to your girlfriends.

04:51.082 --> 04:53.168
Put it in your own diva words.

04:54.669 --> 04:57.380
Just hit the pH balance bullet points.

04:58.548 --> 04:59.758
- Hi Chloe.
- Not now.

04:59.758 --> 05:01.009
Gonna talk to her. Don't worry.

05:01.009 --> 05:04.346
Hey, I'll hold up the vegan purse again.

05:06.639 --> 05:09.225
Thank you. Ooh, gosh.

05:09.225 --> 05:10.769
If Mommy drops this cake,

05:10.769 --> 05:12.479
we'll just turn around
and never come back.

05:15.315 --> 05:16.232
Hey.

05:16.232 --> 05:17.650
It's 3:40
and my mother arrives in 20 minutes

05:17.650 --> 05:20.487
and Gabby can't greet her with that hair.

05:20.487 --> 05:22.614
Which is natural and beautiful.

05:22.614 --> 05:24.532
It is. Of course, it is.

05:24.532 --> 05:26.242
It's just Nana prefers it a certain way.

05:26.242 --> 05:27.327
Right, baby?

05:27.827 --> 05:29.621
- Nana likes "proper little lady" hair.
- That's right.

05:29.621 --> 05:33.291
Well, we have 20 minutes till Eunice
and 40 minutes of hair.

05:35.794 --> 05:37.962
Why can't I wear
some of Mom's hair over there?

05:37.962 --> 05:39.673
That's for when you grow up.

05:40.131 --> 05:41.633
Thank you for your patience, Gabrielle,

05:41.633 --> 05:44.511
but this kind of stuff
is very important to Nana.

05:44.511 --> 05:46.971
When she was a little girl
growin' up in North Carolina,

05:46.971 --> 05:50.058
how you presented yourself was everything.

05:50.809 --> 05:53.228
We have 10 minutes. Please pick it up.

05:53.228 --> 05:55.313
You pick it up. I'm killing it over here.

06:06.658 --> 06:08.201
- Oh, God, let's go, let's go.
- Come on.

06:08.201 --> 06:09.160
No!

06:11.246 --> 06:12.372
I'm trying to go, baby!

06:12.372 --> 06:13.832
- Put it on!
- I'm going!

06:20.380 --> 06:21.715
- Nana!
- Mother!

06:21.715 --> 06:22.716
Eunice!

06:22.716 --> 06:26.094
Gabrielle, you look perfect!

06:27.470 --> 06:30.015
I see you just returned from your

06:30.015 --> 06:32.976
matinee performance in "The Lion King."

06:32.976 --> 06:36.229
Yes, and it was a very good show today.

06:40.984 --> 06:41.901
Okay, go ahead.

06:45.780 --> 06:47.490
- Harry, stop picking.
- Just one olive.

06:48.116 --> 06:51.411
So, Mom, Dad, I have a request.

06:51.411 --> 06:54.330
What can the York-Goldenblatt ATM
do for you today?

06:54.330 --> 06:57.250
- I need an electric keyboard.
- Please say no.

06:57.250 --> 07:00.920
- Honey, you have a Steinway.
- I'm taking my music in a new direction.

07:00.920 --> 07:02.922
- I'm writing songs.
- Parents, I beg you,

07:02.922 --> 07:05.967
for the sake of all of us, say no.

07:05.967 --> 07:07.344
Rock, stop.

07:07.344 --> 07:09.929
All last year, I supported you
realizing who you were.

07:09.929 --> 07:12.640
- You did. Fuck!
- Hey!

07:12.640 --> 07:13.767
- Hey.
- Sorry, I'm just frustrated

07:13.767 --> 07:15.685
that I can't say any more shady things.

07:15.685 --> 07:19.064
Seriously, I need the Nord
and a better audio interface.

07:19.064 --> 07:21.941
I don't know what any of that means,
but here's my translation:

07:21.941 --> 07:23.693
Record on your phone like everybody else.

07:23.693 --> 07:25.320
I'm not everybody else.

07:25.320 --> 07:27.739
- I'm a serious artist.
- Oh, my God.

07:27.739 --> 07:30.617
Honey, you have a job
playing for classes at ABT,

07:30.617 --> 07:32.369
so just save up.

07:32.369 --> 07:33.620
That'll take forever.

07:33.620 --> 07:35.955
I have something that I need to say now.

07:35.955 --> 07:38.667
So do we.
You're on your own, kid, right?

07:38.667 --> 07:41.670
- Am I right?
- Yes, yes! Right.

07:41.670 --> 07:43.713
You want it, you find a way.

07:45.757 --> 07:46.925
That'll work.

07:46.925 --> 07:50.929
Nya, come on, you have to admit
that call last week was crazy.

07:50.929 --> 07:52.722
I'll admit I had too much to drink

07:52.722 --> 07:56.726
and it was a little crazy,

07:56.726 --> 07:59.896
and you admit that you were
playing with fire in your motel room.

07:59.896 --> 08:02.440
- Nothin' happened.
-<i>I could smell the sex through the phone.</i>

08:02.440 --> 08:04.651
Come on, I copped to crazy.

08:04.651 --> 08:06.736
I didn't finish my sentence.

08:08.279 --> 08:10.073
- Yet.
- Yet?

08:10.073 --> 08:12.117
<i>Nothin' happened yet.</i>

08:12.117 --> 08:13.618
I see.

08:14.661 --> 08:17.372
- Do you want it to?
<i>- Sometimes.</i>

08:17.372 --> 08:20.667
Most times, I want us to work out.

08:24.337 --> 08:26.923
Do you have a plan
for how that's gonna happen?

08:26.923 --> 08:28.550
I do.

08:30.343 --> 08:31.803
A surrogate.

08:34.014 --> 08:37.642
<i>Nya? Baby, are you there?</i>

08:38.226 --> 08:41.813
Thanks, Frank.
Are there any visitors from out of town

08:41.813 --> 08:43.982
who would like to identify?

08:45.358 --> 08:48.737
Hi, I'm Miranda, and I'm an alcoholic.

08:48.737 --> 08:50.363
Hi, Miranda.

08:50.363 --> 08:53.491
I'm new to A.A. and L.A.

08:53.491 --> 08:57.328
and I don't have a lot
to fill my days with while I'm out here,

08:57.328 --> 09:00.081
so I'm really grateful for these meetings.

09:00.081 --> 09:01.916
- Welcome.
- Thanks.

09:01.916 --> 09:04.502
So, does anybody have a topic?

09:12.260 --> 09:16.973
I have not seen a pair of virgin arms
like yours in, like, forever.

09:18.224 --> 09:22.187
Seems like you're almost out of space,
so, yes, I do rent.

09:22.187 --> 09:27.025
I'm Allie. Yeah, filling the days
was hard for me too when I first quit,

09:27.025 --> 09:29.861
but I'm volunteering to clean the beach
on Friday.

09:29.861 --> 09:33.031
- Offer's open.
- With like an environmental group?

09:33.031 --> 09:34.657
One of my many, yeah.

09:34.657 --> 09:37.160
My husband calls me an "actor-vist."

09:38.703 --> 09:39.746
I can pick you up.

09:39.746 --> 09:42.624
Oh, that'd be great. Thanks, Allie.

09:43.291 --> 09:46.336
So, how are you feeling about the breakup?

09:46.336 --> 09:49.339
Awful.
Juan Jose was my longest relationship.

09:49.339 --> 09:53.051
Ten years of blowouts and confidences.
He's heard it all.

09:53.051 --> 09:55.970
- I meant you and Zed.
- Oh, shit.

09:57.222 --> 09:58.640
That says a lot.

09:59.516 --> 10:05.063
All right, let's uncurl the blowout
breakup, if it's not too painful.

10:05.063 --> 10:06.606
Well, it is still a little fresh,

10:06.606 --> 10:11.361
but he accused me of bailing out on
all my relationships too soon.

10:11.361 --> 10:14.823
He said I make up
red flags just to get out,

10:14.823 --> 10:16.866
and that's why I'm alone?

10:17.701 --> 10:19.035
He said that to you?

10:19.035 --> 10:21.371
Actually, he screamed it out in his salon.

10:21.371 --> 10:23.373
Do I bail out too quickly?

10:23.373 --> 10:25.250
Well, I don't know
about your relationships,

10:25.250 --> 10:29.546
but we have left a lotta host stands
pretty quickly.

10:29.546 --> 10:31.339
Yeah, I don't stay longer than 10 minutes.

10:31.339 --> 10:35.510
Look, I do the same thing.
I look for or find,

10:35.510 --> 10:39.597
you know, reasons not to move forward
if I'm not 100%.

10:39.597 --> 10:44.060
When I was single, I almost rented a house
in The Hamptons six times,

10:44.060 --> 10:46.396
but I always found a reason not to.

10:46.396 --> 10:48.523
Was that reason always Bethenny Frankel?

10:49.858 --> 10:51.067
Here you go.

10:51.735 --> 10:55.280
Okay, let's get real.
And by real, I mean real estate.

10:55.280 --> 10:57.240
Do you know anyone else who still lives--

10:57.240 --> 10:58.450
With someone they're married to?

10:59.784 --> 11:03.038
- Yes.
- Okay, so, Zed's not the only one--

11:03.038 --> 11:04.122
Right.

11:04.748 --> 11:06.458
But I think he may be a mooch.

11:06.458 --> 11:09.002
He told his ex-wife
to pick up the lunch check.

11:09.002 --> 11:11.880
I just got a feeling,
like an uncomfortable feeling.

11:11.880 --> 11:14.257
Well, if you're uncomfortable,
you're uncomfortable.

11:14.758 --> 11:17.135
It's like me with the vagina
podcast commercial.

11:17.135 --> 11:20.221
- Okay, not at all, but go on.
- Okay.

11:20.555 --> 11:22.390
I'm just not

11:22.390 --> 11:26.353
comfortable pitching
a vaginal wellness product.

11:26.353 --> 11:30.231
Ya know? It's just not in my nature.

11:30.231 --> 11:32.484
- So, I got out of it.
- Juan Jose might say

11:32.484 --> 11:34.152
you should work through those feelings.

11:34.652 --> 11:37.947
Juan Jose would scream it.

11:39.199 --> 11:41.159
<i>Darkness comes, hollow dreams</i>

11:41.159 --> 11:44.829
<i>Empty mirrors, I'm unseen</i>

11:45.872 --> 11:47.290
Did you not see the recording sign?

11:47.290 --> 11:49.709
Calm down.
I'm just grabbing my charger.

11:49.709 --> 11:51.711
Lily, you have that new keyboard.

11:51.711 --> 11:54.631
This is not smart parenting.
I'm gonna kill your father.

11:54.631 --> 11:56.091
Well, that's not smart parenting either

11:56.091 --> 11:57.801
because now you're in prison
and we're alone.

11:57.801 --> 11:58.885
Daddy didn't give me the money.

11:58.885 --> 12:00.929
I sold some of my clothes.

12:00.929 --> 12:03.556
I'm sorry, what?

12:03.556 --> 12:05.642
Well, you said to get it myself,
so I called The Real Deal,

12:05.642 --> 12:07.727
and they came over
and went through my closet.

12:07.727 --> 12:10.397
Wait, the Real Real was here?

12:10.397 --> 12:13.024
No, no, no, The Real Deal.
It's way better.

12:13.024 --> 12:14.693
Oh, my God.

12:19.280 --> 12:20.615
Oh, my God!

12:21.783 --> 12:23.660
It's like The Real Real,

12:23.660 --> 12:27.080
but they're fast, sneaky,
and they pay in cash.

12:27.080 --> 12:28.456
You know, like a drug deal.

12:28.915 --> 12:30.834
Yeah, how many drug deals
have you seen go down?

12:30.834 --> 12:32.585
This is serious.

12:32.585 --> 12:35.088
I can't believe that
Lily's perfect pink Chanel,

12:35.088 --> 12:38.717
the dress I chose for her first grown-up
piano recital,

12:38.717 --> 12:40.593
is just out there online.

12:42.303 --> 12:43.221
On sale!

12:43.221 --> 12:44.347
This is blasphemy.

12:44.848 --> 12:46.808
I think that's Lagerfeld's
last collection.

12:46.808 --> 12:49.644
In a few years,
it will be worth three times that.

12:49.644 --> 12:52.605
Four. I am furious!

12:52.605 --> 12:54.607
- Can I sue?
- Your daughter?

12:54.607 --> 12:57.736
No, them. The Real Deal.
They broke into our home.

12:57.736 --> 13:00.822
Char, there was no crowbar,
there was no forced entry.

13:00.822 --> 13:03.533
They had to be invited in, like vampires.

13:03.533 --> 13:05.535
She is a minor.

13:05.535 --> 13:08.788
They took advantage,
and they took my Chanel.

13:08.788 --> 13:10.331
- Excuse me, hi.
- Yes?

13:10.331 --> 13:11.666
This iced tea isn't cuttin' it.

13:11.666 --> 13:15.337
Can I get a vodka tonic with a straw?
And a drink for this one, too.

13:15.337 --> 13:16.463
Coming right up.

13:16.463 --> 13:18.173
Why the day drinking, you might ask?

13:18.173 --> 13:19.549
I never ask.

13:19.549 --> 13:23.094
My mother-in-law and her sorority sisters
are coming over for afternoon tea

13:23.094 --> 13:24.429
and she's the president

13:24.429 --> 13:27.140
of the "comments that cut
like a knife" chapter.

13:28.308 --> 13:30.810
I'm just so surprised at Lily.

13:30.810 --> 13:32.520
- It was a gift.
- Yes.

13:32.520 --> 13:35.982
A gift she returned
for something she wanted more.

13:35.982 --> 13:38.943
Like I did with that pinky ring
you gave me for my 40th.

13:38.943 --> 13:41.571
- You returned the pinky ring?
- What am I, a mob boss?

13:41.571 --> 13:44.282
But it had that pretty little ruby chip.

13:44.282 --> 13:47.160
Yes. Oddly feminine for a man's ring.

13:47.160 --> 13:49.829
Who's it for, one of the Sopranos?

13:49.829 --> 13:55.001
I remember how the little strap
just fell off Lily's shoulder

13:55.001 --> 13:58.797
just as she was finishing her
"Prelude No. 1 in C."

13:58.797 --> 14:01.716
Is this guy hot enough
to be one of my Hotfellas?

14:03.885 --> 14:05.261
Yes.

14:08.765 --> 14:11.434
Hurry, Daddy, get a cab!
We don't wanna miss the waltz.

14:11.434 --> 14:13.144
Okay. Taxi!

14:13.687 --> 14:15.939
I wish we were going to hip-hop class.

14:16.439 --> 14:18.650
Oh, Daddy!
Daddy, here comes one!

14:19.442 --> 14:20.485
Yep.

14:20.485 --> 14:22.487
Aren't they supposed to stop
if their light is on?

14:22.487 --> 14:24.531
We'll get one, baby. It's okay.

14:24.531 --> 14:26.950
Taxi! Yo!

14:27.325 --> 14:30.328
This never happens when
we're with Claire's daddy.

14:32.080 --> 14:34.249
Ladies, meet me on the corner, okay?

14:35.500 --> 14:36.501
Taxi!

14:37.585 --> 14:38.586
Sir.

14:40.797 --> 14:43.425
'Scuse me, sir. You wanna--

14:46.386 --> 14:47.429
Sir?

14:47.971 --> 14:52.017
This is illegal, so unlock the door
or I'll report you.

14:52.017 --> 14:53.351
Hey!

14:53.935 --> 14:54.936
Hello!

14:56.396 --> 14:59.107
- Yeah, you better go!
- Is that your Herbert?

14:59.107 --> 15:02.235
Certainly not. Let's go up 3rd, okay?

15:02.235 --> 15:04.529
Hi, Nana! Nana!

15:20.920 --> 15:22.714
That's not a cooking show.

15:22.714 --> 15:25.717
No. I'm downloading Final Draft.

15:25.717 --> 15:29.596
The least sexy sentence
ever spoken after sex.

15:29.596 --> 15:32.515
I bought it so we could
rewrite that vagina copy.

15:32.515 --> 15:34.768
The second least sexy sentence.

15:34.768 --> 15:37.604
I thought you talked to Chloe,
and she was okay about it.

15:37.604 --> 15:40.148
Yeah, she was, but then she circled back.

15:41.566 --> 15:42.942
Hate when people circle back.

15:46.029 --> 15:47.322
You wear glasses?

15:47.322 --> 15:48.698
Just when I read.

15:50.742 --> 15:52.452
You know,
we don't have to use that version.

15:52.452 --> 15:56.247
Just, you know, put it in your own voice.
Are you ready?

15:56.247 --> 15:59.334
Throw out some phrases
you might say that would apply to this.

16:01.211 --> 16:04.422
Humiliated, mortified, wanna die?

16:04.422 --> 16:05.882
- I'll start.
- Okay.

16:05.882 --> 16:07.008
How's...

16:08.551 --> 16:11.262
"Ladies, when I go out for a night
on the town, sometime--"

16:11.262 --> 16:13.515
- Pardon?
- I'm just spit-balling here.

16:13.515 --> 16:15.266
"A night on the town"?

16:15.266 --> 16:18.311
Who's doing the talking,
Dorothy Parker's vagina?

16:18.311 --> 16:20.605
Well, Carrie, I don't have one.

16:20.605 --> 16:22.190
I'm not supposed to know
how to talk about it.

16:22.190 --> 16:23.483
Well...

16:23.942 --> 16:27.946
Okay, let's have some fun with it.
What if you call it a "vajayjay"?

16:27.946 --> 16:30.907
Well, I would,
but I don't want people to think that

16:30.907 --> 16:33.785
the podcast is a rerun from the 1990s.

16:34.285 --> 16:39.124
Come on. You're the writer.
We're here. Let's do this thing.

16:39.124 --> 16:43.503
All right, fine. But "here" is where
we usually don't work.

16:43.503 --> 16:48.508
"Here" is where we usually watch
"Beef Grill."

16:50.969 --> 16:52.053
Okay, I got something.

16:53.346 --> 16:56.933
"It'll take you from dry
to wet-ass pussy."

16:57.976 --> 17:00.353
- What?
- It's more current.

17:00.353 --> 17:03.273
It's Cardi B and Megan Thee Stallion.

17:03.273 --> 17:07.110
Well, I'm Carrie B,
and I don't speak like that,

17:07.110 --> 17:09.404
so Megan Thee End.

17:18.246 --> 17:20.040
This is a lovely dinner.

17:20.040 --> 17:23.376
Sorry. I gotta find a new Hotfella.
Kevin has Hep C.

17:23.376 --> 17:25.754
And still no response from The Real Deal,

17:25.754 --> 17:28.506
or should I say The Real Steal's,
corporate office.

17:28.506 --> 17:30.759
- Oy.
- I second that "oy."

17:30.759 --> 17:33.678
Oh, my God! The dress just dropped
another hundred dollars.

17:33.678 --> 17:36.389
Why don't you just walk over there
and buy the fucker back?

17:36.389 --> 17:37.849
Because then they win!

17:37.849 --> 17:41.978
No, most of Lily's good pieces are gone.
Sold. No hope.

17:41.978 --> 17:43.980
I want them to return this dress

17:43.980 --> 17:46.900
with an acknowledgment
that what they did was wrong.

17:46.900 --> 17:48.276
Good luck. I'm still waitin'

17:48.276 --> 17:51.279
for any acknowledgment from my mother
and she's been dead 10 years.

17:52.030 --> 17:53.198
Anthony.

17:53.198 --> 17:54.741
- Anthony!
- What?

17:54.741 --> 17:58.161
How would you feel
if someone stole your beloved

17:58.161 --> 18:02.082
Hotfella's sourdough recipe
and sold it for cheap online?

18:02.082 --> 18:04.751
I would cut them from tongue to taint.

18:04.751 --> 18:06.169
Thank you.

18:06.419 --> 18:10.006
Okay, people.
Lily requests your presence at the piano,

18:10.006 --> 18:15.637
and because I am trapped
into supporting her, I will be there, too.

18:17.931 --> 18:21.434
- Should I open another bottle of red?
- No, sweetie, no.

18:22.102 --> 18:23.353
Showtime.

18:23.978 --> 18:26.356
<i>I am not not the same</i>

18:26.356 --> 18:30.443
<i>Caught inside this gilded cage</i>

18:33.530 --> 18:35.907
<i>Darkness comes, hollow dreams</i>

18:35.907 --> 18:39.994
<i>Empty mirrors, I'm unseen</i>

18:43.581 --> 18:46.084
<i>Park Avenue streets, where do they lead</i>

18:46.084 --> 18:48.962
<i>Stuck in the deep, goddamn</i>

18:48.962 --> 18:51.756
<i>The power of privilege</i>

18:51.756 --> 18:53.299
Should've opened that second bottle.

18:53.299 --> 18:55.760
<i>No reason or rhyme, lost in the climb</i>

18:55.760 --> 19:01.683
<i>Livin' a life confined,
the power of privilege</i>

19:02.392 --> 19:03.893
Who is she,
Lily Eilish?

19:03.893 --> 19:09.232
<i>'Cause I always have to be</i>

19:09.232 --> 19:13.361
<i>The good girl, I'm a good girl</i>

19:13.361 --> 19:18.241
<i>No, I'm not allowed to be me</i>

19:18.950 --> 19:21.870
<i>I'm a good girl, I'm a good girl</i>

19:24.164 --> 19:28.043
Go back to bed, Gabby.
This is Mommy/Daddy time.

19:29.461 --> 19:31.629
Actually, it's Mother time.

19:31.629 --> 19:33.131
Oh, Mother.

19:34.299 --> 19:36.259
Is the electric teapot
giving you trouble again?

19:36.259 --> 19:37.969
I can make you a cup.

19:37.969 --> 19:40.096
I think it's you who needs a cup.

19:40.096 --> 19:41.931
Preferably chamomile.

19:42.515 --> 19:45.477
What was that display all about today?

19:45.477 --> 19:50.065
If those ladies weren't
all half-blind with cataracts,

19:50.065 --> 19:52.025
I'd be mortified.

19:52.025 --> 19:57.697
Imagine my horror seeing my son,
the pride of Morehouse and of Harvard,

19:57.697 --> 20:01.493
pounding on the hood
of a taxicab like some

20:01.493 --> 20:05.705
deranged squeegee man demanding a tip.

20:06.081 --> 20:07.499
What happened? What did I miss?

20:07.499 --> 20:10.502
I pounded on the hood of a cab one time

20:10.502 --> 20:13.296
because that man saw your daughter and I
standing there--

20:13.296 --> 20:15.006
It's irrelevant!

20:15.006 --> 20:17.467
We never surrender our dignity.

20:17.467 --> 20:21.846
Your grandfather
faced the brickbats of Selma

20:21.846 --> 20:25.558
without ever loosening his tie.

20:25.558 --> 20:28.561
Wexleys win by winning.

20:32.607 --> 20:36.069
Didn't the Emancipation Proclamation
free us

20:36.069 --> 20:37.987
from head wraps?

20:38.697 --> 20:40.323
Oh, God.

20:43.410 --> 20:47.163
This isn't like you.
And in front of Gabby?

20:47.163 --> 20:49.708
I did it because
she was standin' right there.

20:49.708 --> 20:52.043
To look at her tiny, little face,

20:52.043 --> 20:55.755
confused because her Daddy
couldn't manage to get a taxicab?

20:55.755 --> 21:00.010
I never thought I'd say these words,
but your mother is right.

21:00.010 --> 21:01.761
You know the rules.

21:01.761 --> 21:07.392
When we go off, they win.
So you have to keep it in check.

21:07.392 --> 21:11.771
Because if you pound on the wrong car
and they take you away

21:12.731 --> 21:14.733
she's gonna find a way to blame me.

21:16.443 --> 21:17.444
Okay?

21:20.572 --> 21:24.743
<i>Thank you so much. Thank you.
You've been awesome. Thank you.</i>

21:26.870 --> 21:30.498
<i>Now, listen, before I leave here tonight,
I just wanna take a moment</i>

21:30.498 --> 21:33.585
<i>to introduce
a very special guest here tonight.</i>

21:34.085 --> 21:37.630
<i>Playing my dad on my new pilot,</i>

21:38.048 --> 21:42.635
<i>the one and only, TV legend Tony Danza!</i>

21:46.723 --> 21:48.308
<i>I know what you're all thinking.</i>

21:48.308 --> 21:51.686
<i>Too hot to play anyone's father.
Tony, come on up here.</i>

21:51.686 --> 21:53.355
<i>- Come on up here.</i>
- You can't stand here.

21:53.355 --> 21:55.023
Oh, I'm sorry.

21:55.023 --> 21:56.858
Excuse me. You're in the way. Hello.

21:56.858 --> 21:58.109
Oh. I'm sorry.

21:58.109 --> 22:01.071
Tony Danza!

22:01.529 --> 22:02.739
Yeah!

22:16.836 --> 22:18.129
Okay, I got something.

22:19.381 --> 22:20.799
Saved by the bell.

22:22.634 --> 22:24.594
Oh, I gotta take this,
it's my friend in L.A.,

22:24.594 --> 22:27.555
but truthfully,
I'd take a robocall to get outta this.

22:30.600 --> 22:31.685
Hello?

22:31.685 --> 22:33.603
Hey! What're you up to?

22:34.354 --> 22:36.147
You know,

22:36.147 --> 22:40.902
writing a commercial for a line
of vaginal products.

22:40.902 --> 22:42.570
Why? Are your books not selling?

22:43.655 --> 22:45.824
No, Franklyn and I
have to do it for the podcast.

22:45.824 --> 22:48.368
Hey, listen, I have a question:
As a friend,

22:48.368 --> 22:53.957
how do you phrase it when you have trouble
down there?

22:53.957 --> 22:57.002
I don't know.
I have nothing but good news down there.

22:57.002 --> 23:00.005
How does that help me?
Ugh, I don't know what happened.

23:00.005 --> 23:03.466
I kissed a guy in an elevator
and now I'm part of a filthy

23:03.466 --> 23:05.301
Tracy/Hepburn writing team.

23:05.301 --> 23:07.637
Yeah, I didn't think
you could do just sex.

23:07.637 --> 23:09.597
Well, now it's sex with homework.

23:11.391 --> 23:14.269
Carrie, I have to hang up.
Tony Danza's comin' right at me.

23:14.269 --> 23:17.439
I get it, you're fancy. All right. Bye.

23:17.439 --> 23:18.481
Bye.

23:18.481 --> 23:20.358
- Hi.
- Miranda, this is Tony.

23:20.358 --> 23:22.610
- Tony, this is Miranda.
- Hello, Miranda.

23:22.610 --> 23:25.363
Such a pleasure to meet
Che's significant person.

23:25.363 --> 23:28.366
Hi. I'm thrilled to meet you.

23:29.117 --> 23:30.410
Well, then, you know
I was just saying to Che,

23:30.410 --> 23:32.078
we should, we should have dinner tomorrow
night?

23:32.078 --> 23:34.205
The three of us? What do ya say?

23:34.205 --> 23:37.917
- You're the boss.
- Cute, cute. She's cute.

23:38.543 --> 23:39.753
- It is "she," right?
- She!

23:39.753 --> 23:41.796
Yeah, okay. See? I'm two for two.

23:49.971 --> 23:52.807
So, I circled back to Chloe
on her circle back.

23:52.807 --> 23:53.892
And?

23:54.309 --> 23:57.896
And she's making it seem like this is
a dealbreaker for "Sex and the City."

23:58.938 --> 24:01.691
So, I bolded the important bullet points.

24:02.275 --> 24:05.737
- Let's give it another shot.
- No, let's not.

24:05.737 --> 24:08.615
I appreciate your zeal but

24:08.615 --> 24:11.284
I think my vagina
has to write its own monologue.

24:11.284 --> 24:12.786
Thank God.

24:16.164 --> 24:19.834
Well, if you need any help,
I got a ton of great ideas.

24:59.207 --> 25:01.626
Oh, my God. Who did this to you?

25:01.626 --> 25:03.545
EZ Blow on 68th Street.

25:03.545 --> 25:06.715
Juan Jose, you made your point.
I got back with Zed.

25:08.800 --> 25:10.010
Look, I'm not gonna beg.

25:10.010 --> 25:12.178
Do you want this top-of-the-line tequila
and my apology or not?

25:12.178 --> 25:14.055
Why are you apologizing for?

25:14.055 --> 25:17.350
For taking what you said too personally.
I know you meant well.

25:17.350 --> 25:20.395
Not necessarily.
I blow hot and cold.

25:20.395 --> 25:22.731
I told this one not to have kids,

25:22.731 --> 25:25.066
I told that one her bangs were bad,

25:25.066 --> 25:28.570
and I told that one to please get a lipo.

25:28.570 --> 25:32.157
No one's listening,
but I was right about the bangs.

25:32.907 --> 25:34.951
Abdal, Kiki's gonna finish you.

25:34.951 --> 25:38.204
Seema is back.
She's my number one.

25:47.505 --> 25:49.341
Oy. <i>QuÃ© es esto?</i>

26:11.321 --> 26:14.491
Nya, I can't talk now.
I'm saving the planet. You're welcome.

26:14.491 --> 26:16.868
Well, I'm saving myself

26:16.868 --> 26:20.997
by de-Andre-fying
my apartment and my life.

26:22.040 --> 26:27.379
<i>Sayonara,</i> tacky-ass Japanese lantern
he bought in a Tokyo airport in 1999!

26:27.379 --> 26:29.130
You're getting rid of Andre Rashad?

26:29.130 --> 26:34.386
No, he got rid of himself.
He told me he hasn't cheated on me yet.

26:34.386 --> 26:37.305
<i>And then, after our many conversations</i>

26:37.305 --> 26:41.017
about my complicated feelings
about having a baby

26:41.017 --> 26:43.436
he suggests a surrogate.

26:43.436 --> 26:45.855
<i>A surrogate! Miranda!</i>

26:45.855 --> 26:49.234
<i>He hasn't heard me at all.
Not in two years!</i>

26:49.234 --> 26:55.073
So, that's it! Because motel girl
plus the surrogate equals I'm done!

26:55.073 --> 26:57.826
- I'm so sorry.
<i>- I'm not.</i>

26:57.826 --> 27:00.745
<i>So, I'm carefully packin' his things.</i>

27:01.329 --> 27:03.748
Buh-bye, patchouli incense.

27:04.082 --> 27:08.962
Later, lame-ass college roommate's
mixed-media

27:08.962 --> 27:13.591
"collage homage to Nubian women"
made of Korean weave hair!

27:14.175 --> 27:17.053
Bonfire of the beanies at 11!

27:17.637 --> 27:18.805
- Miranda.
- Hold on.

27:18.805 --> 27:20.348
I have to go. Here's your bag.

27:20.348 --> 27:22.642
I'm sorry, my kid's school just called.

27:22.642 --> 27:25.562
There was some micro-aggression
over a Squishmallow.

27:25.562 --> 27:29.065
- Preschool drama.
- Go, go! I can get an Uber home.

27:29.065 --> 27:31.359
Okay, bye. Sorry.

27:32.402 --> 27:34.112
Nya, I should hang up.

27:34.112 --> 27:37.449
Cell phones and environmentalists,
not a great match.

27:37.449 --> 27:40.827
Do you know anybody who wants to buy six
or eight guitars, cheap?

27:40.827 --> 27:43.121
I'm havin' a "goin' out of Andre" sale.

27:43.121 --> 27:45.331
Okay. Buh-bye.

27:47.917 --> 27:49.586
We're makin' real progress, huh?

27:50.086 --> 27:53.840
The Earth is already dead.
We're basically just cleaning up a corpse.

27:54.758 --> 27:57.135
You're a delight. Let's talk more.

27:57.802 --> 27:59.387
Not funny.

28:01.890 --> 28:04.476
Well, here we are.

28:04.476 --> 28:06.811
- Are we ready?
- Oh, I'm so ready. I am so ready.

28:06.811 --> 28:09.272
You just tell me when.
You know, you give me the sign.

28:09.272 --> 28:10.607
Take that trash can right there,

28:10.607 --> 28:12.734
I'm gonna throw it
right through this window.

28:12.734 --> 28:16.821
Nope.
I am gonna kill them with kindness.

28:17.489 --> 28:20.825
They are gonna give me that dress back
and I'm gonna bring my baby home.

28:21.534 --> 28:23.411
You are so clever!

28:30.919 --> 28:33.296
There's some really great stuff in here.

28:33.838 --> 28:35.840
No, there isn't.

28:36.383 --> 28:37.550
No, there isn't.

28:37.550 --> 28:40.637
Hello.
I am Charlotte York-Goldenblatt.

28:40.637 --> 28:42.681
You may have received my emails.

28:43.181 --> 28:44.683
I don't know.

28:44.683 --> 28:47.227
Well, they were numerous.

28:47.227 --> 28:51.272
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God, oh, my God.

28:51.272 --> 28:56.152
Oh, my God. These Sonia Rykiel--
How has nobody bought these?

28:56.986 --> 28:59.406
How long have they been
just sitting there?

28:59.406 --> 29:01.074
I don't know.

29:02.575 --> 29:04.869
- What?
- I have an itty-bitty problem

29:04.869 --> 29:08.039
and I am sure that you and I
can solve it together.

29:08.039 --> 29:09.958
- What is your name?
- Eden.

29:09.958 --> 29:14.045
Eden! You and I together,
Eden, can solve this.

29:14.045 --> 29:18.216
So, my daughter, Lily,
sold you a bunch of clothes,

29:18.216 --> 29:23.346
and she is still a minor.
Surely you have rules against this.

29:23.346 --> 29:26.599
This isn't a bar. We don't card.

29:27.767 --> 29:29.185
Starting fresh.

29:29.853 --> 29:30.937
Eden.

29:33.314 --> 29:38.236
I am looking for this Chanel dress.
Is it at this location?

29:38.236 --> 29:39.529
I don't know.

29:39.529 --> 29:45.160
Well, maybe you could look here
in this little computer to see.

29:45.160 --> 29:49.122
These boots are in super-good shape.

29:49.122 --> 29:52.292
You are sleeping with the enemy, Carrie.

29:52.292 --> 29:53.793
I'm sorry.

29:59.424 --> 30:00.467
- Great Job.
- Thanks.

30:00.467 --> 30:02.260
- Yeah, no problem.
- Thank you.

30:08.892 --> 30:11.353
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

30:14.147 --> 30:15.315
I lost my phone!

30:15.315 --> 30:16.775
Did anybody see a phone?

30:16.775 --> 30:21.321
Oh, my God, I don't have my phone,
and I need it to call Uber.

30:21.321 --> 30:22.572
Uber's a Ponzi scheme.

30:23.323 --> 30:26.076
Again?! So helpful!

30:26.993 --> 30:30.455
God.
Did you see a phone?

30:30.705 --> 30:33.917
- I lost my phone!
- Bummer!

30:34.626 --> 30:35.543
Damn it.

30:36.252 --> 30:40.382
Ah, fuck. Ah, fuck, fuck, fuck.

31:21.423 --> 31:23.758
Hi! Hello.

31:23.758 --> 31:25.135
I'm sorry to accost you,

31:25.135 --> 31:27.887
but I lost my phone
trying to save the planet,

31:27.887 --> 31:31.141
and I wonder if I could borrow
one of yours for a super quick call?

31:31.808 --> 31:33.977
- Yeah.
- Oh, thank you so much.

31:33.977 --> 31:37.105
- You're welcome.
- Oh, could you open that for me?

31:37.105 --> 31:40.150
- Yep.
- Thank you. All right.

31:40.150 --> 31:41.818
- Want some?
- No, thank you.

31:48.033 --> 31:49.200
Breathe.

31:52.787 --> 31:54.581
Unknown caller.

31:54.581 --> 31:57.000
Better not be the Democrats again.

31:59.502 --> 32:00.503
Hello?

32:01.004 --> 32:03.006
Carrie, it's Miranda. I lost my phone.

32:03.006 --> 32:05.175
Well, whose phone is this?

32:05.175 --> 32:07.552
A nice surfer in a parking lot.

32:07.552 --> 32:11.598
- Why are you so very fancy?
- What's Che's phone number?

32:12.432 --> 32:13.808
You don't know Che's phone number?

32:13.808 --> 32:15.060
Don't say it like that.

32:15.060 --> 32:17.020
Nobody knows anybody's number anymore.

32:17.020 --> 32:18.938
All right, hold on a second,
I'll look it up.

32:18.938 --> 32:20.398
You see?

32:22.150 --> 32:23.193
Hi.

32:23.193 --> 32:25.111
She's just getting me a number.

32:32.660 --> 32:34.329
- Hello?
- It's Miranda.

32:34.329 --> 32:35.705
Why aren't you home yet?

32:35.705 --> 32:39.668
I lost my phone on the beach,
and I can't call an Uber without it.

32:39.668 --> 32:40.877
Can you come and get me?

32:40.877 --> 32:44.339
At the beach? It's rush hour.

32:44.339 --> 32:47.217
It'll take me, like,
an hour and a half to get there.

32:47.217 --> 32:49.135
We have dinner with Tony Danza in an hour!

32:50.136 --> 32:51.971
Well, I don't, obviously.

32:51.971 --> 32:55.892
Shit. Do you want me to cancel, or--

32:55.892 --> 32:59.187
You can't cancel. It's Tony Danza!

33:03.316 --> 33:06.277
Okay, I have an idea. I'll send someone
to get you. Where are you?

33:07.404 --> 33:09.364
Can you tell them where I am?

33:13.159 --> 33:18.081
We're, like, off PCH, like,
across from Neptune's Net.

33:19.874 --> 33:20.792
You got that?

33:20.792 --> 33:22.585
Yeah, yeah, I got it, I got it.
Stay there.

33:22.585 --> 33:24.713
Where the fuck else am I going?

33:25.505 --> 33:26.923
- Shit.
- Thank you.

33:26.923 --> 33:29.801
- You're welcome.
- Please stop offering me that.

33:29.801 --> 33:32.512
So, where am I? Neptune somethin'?

33:32.512 --> 33:33.596
- Yeah.
- It's up there.

33:33.596 --> 33:35.682
Neptune's Net, is that way.

33:35.682 --> 33:38.351
Oh, okay. That way, all right.

33:38.351 --> 33:40.395
Thank you guys so much.
You saved my life.

33:40.395 --> 33:43.106
- A thousand times thank you, thank you.
- You're welcome.

33:44.190 --> 33:45.066
Good luck.

34:07.589 --> 34:10.717
Okay. I found it.
It is in a warehouse.

34:10.717 --> 34:13.762
Fine. I give up. I'll buy it back.

34:13.762 --> 34:15.764
You can't. It's on hold.

34:15.764 --> 34:17.974
What? It's on hold where?

34:20.060 --> 34:22.354
- I don't know.
- Listen, Eden, my husband

34:22.354 --> 34:25.315
is a partner at a major New York law firm,

34:25.315 --> 34:29.277
so you might wanna watch your tone
or I am gonna call your manager.

34:29.277 --> 34:31.654
Hey, Charlotte,
can I have a word over here? Real quick.

34:36.159 --> 34:38.119
Dead as she is,

34:38.119 --> 34:41.790
I don't think Eden can take much more interrogation.

34:41.790 --> 34:42.957
And she's got a phone.

34:42.957 --> 34:45.710
You're, like, this close to being a meme.

34:45.710 --> 34:51.049
I know. I don't know what's wrong with me.
And even if I got the dress back,

34:51.049 --> 34:53.635
I don't even know if Lily
could fit into it anymore.

34:55.178 --> 34:57.180
First the Chanel, and then the Chopin.

34:57.180 --> 34:59.599
I just feel like she's rejecting
everything I ever gave her.

35:00.475 --> 35:04.270
Is she rejecting it, or is she,
you know, like you just said,

35:04.270 --> 35:05.480
is she outgrowing it?

35:06.815 --> 35:10.819
You know? And that's healthy, right?
Wanting to change and move on.

35:12.612 --> 35:14.906
Who am I to say? I'm still fighting
to save "Sex and the City."

35:14.906 --> 35:16.950
I'm not sure it fits me anymore either.

35:22.122 --> 35:24.416
I don't need that dress.

35:24.416 --> 35:25.834
I have the memory.

35:26.584 --> 35:29.796
And Lily. Whoever she is now.

35:30.171 --> 35:31.047
Let's go.

35:31.673 --> 35:33.925
Yeah, but before we go,
can I just get the other boot?

35:34.467 --> 35:36.011
Then I'll have a pair.

36:01.202 --> 36:04.289
Miranda. Che sent me. I'm Lyle.

36:04.289 --> 36:07.375
Fair warning, Lyle,

36:08.418 --> 36:09.461
I smell.

36:14.591 --> 36:16.009
How bad is it?

36:18.303 --> 36:21.973
I used to shuck oysters in high school,
so it's nostalgic.

36:21.973 --> 36:24.851
That's generous.

36:25.643 --> 36:27.354
Thank you so much
for driving all the way out here.

36:27.354 --> 36:29.356
Actually, I live out here.

36:29.356 --> 36:31.399
Yeah, I work at the Malibu Soho House, so.

36:31.399 --> 36:32.567
Malibu Soho, nice.

36:32.567 --> 36:33.777
Yeah.

36:34.361 --> 36:35.779
And what do you do there, Lyle?

36:35.779 --> 36:37.864
I'm a mixologist.

36:37.864 --> 36:41.576
Used to be called a bartender
before their margaritas hit 22 bucks.

36:43.078 --> 36:44.788
And how do you know Che?

36:44.788 --> 36:46.122
We were married.

36:47.832 --> 36:49.626
Technically, we still are.

36:54.839 --> 36:56.424
So, ukulele?

36:56.424 --> 36:58.718
Oh, yeah, you bet.

36:58.718 --> 37:00.595
That's what I heard.

37:02.806 --> 37:03.765
Che.

37:04.933 --> 37:07.268
I'm really excited about
being in your project.

37:08.186 --> 37:09.896
I feel like there's a "but" coming.

37:09.896 --> 37:12.691
Well, there is. I can't be Mexican.

37:13.983 --> 37:17.654
I mean, it's just not gonna fly,
especially these days.

37:17.654 --> 37:20.657
I thought because he's Mexican-American

37:20.657 --> 37:22.826
and it's a comedy, I thought I'd be okay,

37:22.826 --> 37:25.537
but I'm already getting
pushback on social media.

37:25.537 --> 37:28.206
And rightly so. I'm not Mexican.

37:28.206 --> 37:30.583
Okay, but my father's Mexican.

37:30.583 --> 37:33.169
Yeah, yeah.
I know, I know, but he doesn't have to be.

37:33.169 --> 37:37.549
He can be Italian, like me,
and we switch your mother to Mexican.

37:37.549 --> 37:39.009
But I'm Irish/Mexican.

37:39.718 --> 37:42.637
Italian is just Irish with better food.

37:42.637 --> 37:45.098
The important thing is
to preserve the Mexican.

37:45.473 --> 37:48.351
So, I spoke to ABC, and if you approve,

37:48.351 --> 37:50.937
your Irish mother is now dead.

37:50.937 --> 37:56.151
and we switch all of her emotional scenes
to the Mexican grandmother, your <i>abuela,</i>

37:56.151 --> 37:58.820
who, by the way,
is killing it in the run-throughs.

38:00.238 --> 38:01.531
Listen, kid,

38:01.531 --> 38:03.950
I want you to succeed. I really do.

38:03.950 --> 38:06.995
I think what you're doing here
is really important and cute.

38:06.995 --> 38:10.832
I think you're gonna open a lotta hearts
and change a lotta minds.

38:10.832 --> 38:14.502
But you're not gonna do that
with Tony Danza as a Mexican.

38:15.962 --> 38:21.468
I've come too far to get canceled now.
And the Danza-lions agree with me.

38:22.052 --> 38:23.928
I'm sorry, the Danza-lions?

38:23.928 --> 38:25.388
My hardcore fans.

38:34.939 --> 38:37.192
So, what got into you last week?

38:37.192 --> 38:39.027
Me. I got into me.

38:39.361 --> 38:42.113
I sometimes get lost in my head.

38:42.113 --> 38:46.826
But those five amazing texts from you
helped me find my way back.

38:48.620 --> 38:50.497
I have a proposition for you.

38:52.791 --> 38:54.459
I'm all ears.

38:54.459 --> 38:57.212
There's an opportunity
to invest in this new private club

38:57.212 --> 38:58.713
here in Manhattan.

38:59.214 --> 39:00.715
They just want $200,000.

39:02.008 --> 39:04.928
So, let's go in as partners,

39:05.679 --> 39:07.305
$100,000 each?

39:07.639 --> 39:11.851
Interesting.
And what's this club called, "Red Flag"?

39:12.268 --> 39:17.357
I thought those five texts were suspect.
Three would've been appropriate.

39:18.483 --> 39:21.444
It's not like that.
This is a legitimate investment.

39:21.444 --> 39:23.029
Yeah, well...

39:25.865 --> 39:27.450
maybe.

39:27.450 --> 39:29.536
But I'm investing in myself.

39:30.203 --> 39:33.623
Juan Jose was wrong. I was right.

39:35.125 --> 39:36.543
Where are you going?

39:38.586 --> 39:40.755
We're having chocolate mousse.

39:41.047 --> 39:43.049
Who the fuck is Juan Jose?

39:58.398 --> 40:01.317
You are not gonna believe what just
happened to me at dinner.

40:04.446 --> 40:07.407
- What's that face?
- I don't know your number.

40:07.407 --> 40:08.825
Excuse me?

40:08.825 --> 40:13.663
Your phone number.
I had no idea. I had to call Carrie.

40:14.289 --> 40:17.792
Also, I had no idea
you're actually married.

40:18.501 --> 40:21.254
Well, technically.

40:21.254 --> 40:24.591
Yeah, we're both such slackers,
we never got around to getting divorced.

40:25.008 --> 40:26.968
Che, I don't know who you are.

40:26.968 --> 40:28.094
Well...

40:29.054 --> 40:32.015
Well, join the club
'cause up until an hour ago,

40:32.015 --> 40:33.850
I thought I was Mexican/Irish.

40:34.809 --> 40:37.187
Tony Danza and ABC just made me Italian.

40:37.562 --> 40:40.899
<i>- La fungoule!</i>
- I'm serious.

40:40.899 --> 40:42.984
Yeah, and please don't be.

40:43.610 --> 40:46.029
I've got enough on my plate right now.

40:46.488 --> 40:50.909
And we're having so much fun.
Let's not let your lost phone

40:50.909 --> 40:53.578
become a couple's
existential crisis, okay?

40:53.578 --> 40:56.664
My number is three-four-seven

40:57.540 --> 40:58.792
five-three-two

40:59.918 --> 41:01.044
Nine-nine.

41:02.212 --> 41:03.296
Are you getting this?

41:08.510 --> 41:12.639
Never thought I could,
but I can actually live with what I wrote.

41:12.639 --> 41:14.724
Yeah, it's really funny.

41:15.517 --> 41:21.064
Is there, is there an inordinate amount
of box activity in the hallway today?

41:21.064 --> 41:22.941
Hey. I hope you're happy.

41:22.941 --> 41:26.820
You two wouldn't talk about her vagina
and now everyone's outta work.

41:27.487 --> 41:29.656
That's ridiculous, Chloe.
What happened?

41:29.656 --> 41:32.409
Every show is over, that's what happened.

41:32.409 --> 41:36.579
They sold these studios to Apple
or Peach or whatever the fuck.

41:36.579 --> 41:39.582
I told you: sinking ship.

41:39.582 --> 41:44.129
Word of advice, Carrie, next job,
don't be so precious about your pussy.

41:47.257 --> 41:49.467
Well, I'll take that to heart.

42:04.858 --> 42:09.988
Okay, but you've said,
more than once, I might add,

42:09.988 --> 42:11.865
that we could always

42:11.865 --> 42:14.743
- sell the podcast somewhere else.
- Well, that was before.

42:14.743 --> 42:17.037
It's hard to sell something
that's been canceled.

42:17.829 --> 42:19.372
Wanna try?

42:20.331 --> 42:22.959
I don't know if it's smart
to go any further.

42:25.920 --> 42:27.922
With the podcast?

42:29.632 --> 42:30.633
Carrie

42:31.343 --> 42:32.927
you've made it pretty clear
that you want this to be

42:32.927 --> 42:36.639
a, a Thursday thing,
and I'm starting to feel like

42:36.639 --> 42:38.183
maybe I want more.

42:38.683 --> 42:41.728
So, if Thursday's still the case...

42:42.687 --> 42:44.064
I better get out

42:44.064 --> 42:46.524
before I'm all fucked up
Friday through Wednesday.

42:48.068 --> 42:52.280
- Well, I wouldn't want that.
- Yeah. Neither would I.

42:52.906 --> 42:53.907
Well

42:54.616 --> 42:56.910
thank you for the "Sex and the City."

42:57.786 --> 43:00.622
Double entendre intended.

43:00.622 --> 43:02.999
See? You are the writer.

43:09.130 --> 43:13.343
<i>And just like that,
I freed up my entire week.</i>
