03:14.112 --> 03:16.032
- You should be terrified.
- Why?

03:16.197 --> 03:19.117
Because I will be taking over the city.

Mmm...

03:20.577 --> 03:22.447
- What?
- Batman will stop you.

03:42.640 --> 03:44.280
- Good night, Steve.
- Take it easy, Jeff.

Man, I really like that guy.

04:48.665 --> 04:50.115
Nope, they're all real.

04:50.291 --> 04:51.711
Probably worth a Google.

04:54.045 --> 04:55.795
- Hey, watch it!
- Commissioner Gordon!

04:55.964 --> 04:56.974
What is it, O'Hara?

04:57.131 --> 04:58.131
We just got a report!

04:58.299 --> 05:00.719
All the Z-grade villains have
broken into the energy plant!

05:00.885 --> 05:01.925
What are we gonna do, sir?

05:02.053 --> 05:04.453
The only thing we ever do.
Flip the switch to the Bat-Signal!

05:04.597 --> 05:05.597
Flip!

<i>Commissioner, are you there?</i>

05:07.183 --> 05:08.893

05:09.060 --> 05:10.900
<i>It's Egghead, sir.</i>

05:11.062 --> 05:12.562
I'm well aware of his work.

Dear gosh.
You've destroyed the Bat-Signal.

05:15.066 --> 05:16.606

Fire in the hole!

05:48.683 --> 05:50.163
O'Hara, have you tried the Bat-Phone?

05:50.268 --> 05:52.598
Yes, but all I'm getting
is this hold music.

05:54.564 --> 05:55.614
I love it.

05:58.901 --> 06:00.879
- I want snipers trained on that building!
- You bet!

06:00.903 --> 06:03.063
- I want water and air support, yesterday!
- Ahoy, sir!

06:03.197 --> 06:04.617
And I need SWAT here now!

06:04.782 --> 06:05.926
Phone call

06:05.950 --> 06:06.950
Hello? Batman?

06:07.118 --> 06:09.658
Hi, Jimmy! It's the Jokes. Oop!

06:09.829 --> 06:11.209
Nobody calls you that.

06:11.414 --> 06:13.214
Yes, people do call me that.

06:13.374 --> 06:14.384
Okay, listen up.

Go, go, go!

<i>At this very moment,

If the mayor isn't here in five minutes
to negotiate the city's surrender,

06:27.889 --> 06:31.599
<i>then I shall destroy Gotham City.</i>

06:31.768 --> 06:33.188
I did something!

06:33.352 --> 06:35.942
<i>Doctor, that sounds frightening
and overly complicated.</i>

06:36.105 --> 06:37.105
<i>Talk us through it.</i>

06:37.398 --> 06:40.938
<i>Well, I don't wanna scare
any small children who may be listening,</i>

06:41.110 --> 06:42.870
<i>but it's a little-known fact
that Gotham City</i>

06:42.987 --> 06:46.317
<i>is built on a bunch of flimsy plates
stuck together.</i>

06:46.491 --> 06:48.741
<i>There's literally nothing beneath us,</i>

06:48.910 --> 06:52.160
<i>except an infinite abyss
that smells like dirty underwear.</i>

06:52.330 --> 06:54.250
<i>If Joker's bomb were to go off,</i>

06:54.415 --> 06:56.325
<i>these plates would break apart,</i>

06:56.501 --> 06:58.131
<i>plunging every Gotham citizen</i>

06:58.294 --> 07:00.844
<i>into the eternal abyss forever.</i>

07:01.005 --> 07:02.665
<i>And you wouldn't want that,
now would you?</i>

07:02.840 --> 07:05.590
Now get me the mayor! Joker out!

07:05.760 --> 07:08.470
Madam Mayor,
I cannot ask you to do this!

07:08.638 --> 07:11.178
- Jim, did you find Batman?
- No, ma'am.

07:11.349 --> 07:12.849
Then we have no choice.

07:13.017 --> 07:17.357
The Joker has the upper hand.
We have to surrender Gotham City.

07:17.522 --> 07:18.822
Oh, no.

07:18.981 --> 07:20.731
I'm sorry!

07:21.651 --> 07:23.441
<i>Flying the mayor

07:23.611 --> 07:25.781
<i>SWAT team,

- Non-lethal.
- Yeah!

<i>Lowering

07:30.701 --> 07:32.201
Madam Mayor!

07:32.370 --> 07:33.750
Thanks for dropping by.

07:34.247 --> 07:37.207
I've only got one thing
to say to you, Joker.

07:37.375 --> 07:39.165
Well, you better make it fast.

07:39.335 --> 07:40.375
Do you like to gamble?

07:40.545 --> 07:41.625
Oh, I certainly do.

07:41.796 --> 07:43.546
Do you ever play roulette?

07:43.714 --> 07:44.764
On occasion.

07:44.924 --> 07:46.634
Well, let me give you a word of advice.

07:46.801 --> 07:47.801
I'm all ears.

07:47.969 --> 07:49.219
When playing roulette...

07:49.387 --> 07:50.507
Yes?

07:51.222 --> 07:53.182
...always bet on black.

07:53.349 --> 07:54.349

You're completely outnumbered here!

And I always get away!

10:23.541 --> 10:25.081
Not this time.

10:27.837 --> 10:28.917
'Cause this time

10:29.422 --> 10:30.592
I got you.

10:30.756 --> 10:31.796
Oh, yeah?

10:31.966 --> 10:34.046
Well, there's only one problem.

10:34.719 --> 10:36.549
<i>Who's gonna defuse the bomb?</i>

10:36.721 --> 10:38.351
It's gotta be one or the other, Batman.

10:38.514 --> 10:42.814
Save the city,
or catch your greatest enemy.

10:42.977 --> 10:43.977
You can't do both.

10:44.145 --> 10:45.289
I'm sorry, what did you just say?

10:45.313 --> 10:46.353
You can't do both, I said.

10:46.480 --> 10:47.570
No, I mean the other thing.

10:47.732 --> 10:49.612
Save the city,
or catch your greatest enemy.

10:49.775 --> 10:51.175
You think you're my greatest enemy?

10:51.277 --> 10:53.397
Yes! You're obsessed with me!

10:53.571 --> 10:54.701
No, I'm not.

10:54.864 --> 10:56.024
- Yes, you are.
- No, I'm not.

10:56.115 --> 10:59.365
Yes, you are! Who else drives you
to one-up them the way that I do?

10:59.535 --> 11:00.865
- Bane.
- No, he doesn't!

11:01.037 --> 11:03.117
- Superman.
- Superman's not a bad guy!

11:03.289 --> 11:06.169
Then I'd say that I don't
currently have a bad guy.

11:06.334 --> 11:08.594
I am fighting a few different people.

11:08.753 --> 11:09.753
What?

11:09.920 --> 11:10.920
I like to fight around.

11:11.088 --> 11:13.628
Okay, look, I'm fine with you
fighting other people

11:13.799 --> 11:17.639
if you wanna do that,
but what we have is special.

11:18.095 --> 11:19.095
So, when people ask you

11:19.263 --> 11:21.103
"Who's your number one bad guy?"
you say...

11:21.265 --> 11:22.345
Superman.

11:22.516 --> 11:24.476
Are you seriously saying
that there is nothing,

11:24.643 --> 11:27.063
nothing special about our relationship?

11:27.605 --> 11:28.605
Whoa.

11:28.814 --> 11:31.404
Let me tell you something, J-bird.

11:31.567 --> 11:35.277
- Batman doesn't do 'ships.
- What?

11:35.446 --> 11:37.776
As in "relationships."

11:38.616 --> 11:41.286
<i>There is no "us."</i>

11:41.452 --> 11:44.712
<i>Batman and Joker are not a thing.</i>

11:45.790 --> 11:47.420
<i>I don't need you.</i>

11:48.376 --> 11:50.286
<i>I don't need anyone.</i>

11:52.004 --> 11:54.974
You mean nothing to me.

11:59.178 --> 12:00.968
No one does.

12:28.290 --> 12:30.330
Hurray! Batman!

12:30.501 --> 12:31.711
<i>You did it!</i>

12:31.877 --> 12:33.087
You're welcome.

12:33.254 --> 12:35.014
- Thank you, Batman.
- Oh, my pleasure.

12:36.590 --> 12:38.180
Batman, we love you!

12:38.342 --> 12:40.972
Thank you!
I'm blushing super hard under the mask.

12:41.137 --> 12:43.717
<i>- Grazie,</i> Batman!
<i>- Prego.</i>

12:43.889 --> 12:45.492
- You're the best, Batman!
- Oh, I'm humble.

12:45.516 --> 12:48.056
- Thanks, Batman!
- I'm super modest about it. Thank you.

12:48.227 --> 12:50.587
- Batman, you're the greatest!
- Oh, pray hands, pray hands.

12:50.980 --> 12:53.230
- Thanks for saving the city!
- You're welcome.

12:53.399 --> 12:55.189
Batman,
I love you more than my kids!

12:55.359 --> 12:56.359
<i>So do I, guy!</i>

13:02.700 --> 13:04.370
<i>You're our hero, Batman!</i>

13:04.535 --> 13:06.865
I love my life.

13:07.037 --> 13:08.037
Computer.

13:08.205 --> 13:09.205
<i>Go ahead.</i>

13:09.373 --> 13:11.083
<i>- Are we near the orphanage?
- Yes.</i>

13:11.250 --> 13:14.460
Great.
Let's turn those frowns upside down.

13:18.507 --> 13:19.757
That sounds like the Batmobile.

13:22.511 --> 13:23.551
No way!

13:24.138 --> 13:25.388
Hey, orphans! Look who's here!

13:25.598 --> 13:27.058
It's Batman!

13:27.391 --> 13:30.231
Hey, kids.
Who wants a shot from the merch gun?

13:30.394 --> 13:32.194
- I do, I do, I do!
- Great!

13:32.354 --> 13:34.194
<i>- Kaboom!</i>
- I got a lunchbox!

13:34.356 --> 13:36.476
<i>- Kaboom!</i>
- I got a sippy cup!

13:36.650 --> 13:38.900
<i>- Kaboom!</i>
- I got a Batarang!

13:39.069 --> 13:40.739
And the rest of you get Bat Bucks.

13:40.905 --> 13:42.235
<i>Kaboom!</i>

13:42.406 --> 13:44.406
Remember, kids,
if you want to be like Batman,

13:44.575 --> 13:46.075
take care of your abs. Batman out!

13:46.410 --> 13:49.120
Batman! Batman! Batman!

13:56.003 --> 13:57.923
Thanks, Batman. You're my hero!

14:02.760 --> 14:03.760
<i>Whoo!</i>

14:20.027 --> 14:21.147
<i>What is the password?</i>

14:21.320 --> 14:22.780
Iron Man sucks.

14:22.947 --> 14:24.027
<i>Thank you.</i>

14:25.282 --> 14:27.952
<i>It must be great to be Batman.</i>

14:28.118 --> 14:30.288
<i>I can only imagine
he is going home right now</i>

14:30.454 --> 14:32.084
<i>to party the night away,</i>

14:32.248 --> 14:35.788
<i>surrounded by scores of friends
and lady tennis players.</i>

14:45.094 --> 14:46.604
Hey, Computer.

14:47.137 --> 14:48.137
I'm home.

14:52.518 --> 14:53.688
<i>Welcome home, sir.</i>

14:53.852 --> 14:56.692
<i>Initializing Batcave operating system.</i>

14:59.108 --> 15:00.108
Hey, 'Puter.

15:01.485 --> 15:03.485
<i>What's up, Batman?</i>

15:04.613 --> 15:06.243
Put this bomb in the museum.

15:06.407 --> 15:07.407
<i>Certainly, sir.</i>

15:08.534 --> 15:10.124
<i>- Thank you.
- No worries.</i>

15:10.869 --> 15:12.829
Anything exciting happen
when I was gone?

15:12.997 --> 15:14.367
<i>You have four pieces of mail.</i>

15:14.540 --> 15:15.870
Great, what'd I get?

15:16.041 --> 15:17.881
<i>You have this week's Pennysaver,</i>

15:18.043 --> 15:21.013
<i>two bills,
and a coupon for Bed Bath and Beyond.</i>

15:21.171 --> 15:23.051
<i>It expires in two weeks.</i>

15:23.215 --> 15:26.335
<i>But I've heard that some stores
will honor them past the expiry date.</i>

15:26.510 --> 15:27.510
Copy that.

15:27.678 --> 15:31.718
<i>Also, Alfred is on the 17th floor,
grouting tiles in the second bathroom</i>

15:31.890 --> 15:33.270
<i>of the fifth master bedroom.</i>

15:34.143 --> 15:36.063
<i>Do you want me to tell Alfred
you're home?</i>

15:36.228 --> 15:38.978
No, that's cool, Computer.
Thanks for the update.

15:39.148 --> 15:40.858
I should probably
have some dinner.

15:41.025 --> 15:43.355
<i>Alfred left your lobster thermidor
in the fridge.</i>

15:43.527 --> 15:44.527
Oh, that's my favorite.

15:45.112 --> 15:46.862
I can't wait.

16:04.715 --> 16:08.045
Oh, not 20 minutes. Stupid.

17:16.578 --> 17:18.117
Oh, wait.

17:18.288 --> 17:20.667
There, which one is, uh...

17:21.625 --> 17:22.625
Okay.

17:31.135 --> 17:33.845
<i>You complete me.</i>

17:35.180 --> 17:38.480
<i>Shut up. You had me at hello.</i>

17:40.269 --> 17:41.439
Love it!

18:20.017 --> 18:21.307
<i>Hey, Mom.</i>

18:22.352 --> 18:23.812
<i>Hey, Dad.</i>

18:25.230 --> 18:26.320
I, uh...

18:26.732 --> 18:28.692
I saved the city again today.

18:32.529 --> 18:34.279
<i>I wish you could have seen me.</i>

18:36.033 --> 18:38.333
I think you would have been
really proud.

18:41.038 --> 18:42.158
There you are!

18:43.707 --> 18:46.377
Oh! Alfred! I am so sorry.

18:46.543 --> 18:47.963
I have incredible reflexes.

18:48.128 --> 18:49.548
No, it's all my fault, sir.

18:49.713 --> 18:51.941
I should have known better
than to sneak up on you like that.

18:51.965 --> 18:54.545
Sorry, I was just lost in thought,
and as you know,

18:54.718 --> 18:56.298
when I'm in there, I'm in deep.

18:56.470 --> 18:58.760
Were you looking
at the old family pictures again?

18:59.306 --> 19:01.556
At the what? The old family...

19:01.725 --> 19:03.725
Oh, yes! I see what you mean.

19:03.894 --> 19:06.274
<i>Look at that! The old gang.</i>

19:06.438 --> 19:08.398
Yeah. No, I wasn't.

19:09.566 --> 19:10.896
I see.

19:11.068 --> 19:14.448
Sir, if you don't mind my saying,
I'm a little concerned.

19:14.613 --> 19:20.243
I've seen you go through similar phases
in 2016 and 2012 and 2008 and 2005

19:20.410 --> 19:23.410
<i>and 1997 and 1995 and 1992 and 1989</i>

19:23.580 --> 19:27.040
<i>and that weird one in 1966.</i>

19:27.209 --> 19:29.999
Do you want to talk about
how you're feeling right now?

19:30.170 --> 19:32.260
I don't talk about feelings, Alfred.

19:32.422 --> 19:34.012
I don't have any, I've never seen one.

19:34.174 --> 19:36.974
I'm a night-stalking,
crime-fighting vigilante,

19:37.135 --> 19:38.795
and a heavy metal rapping machine.

19:38.971 --> 19:42.021
I don't feel anything emotionally,
except for rage.

19:42.182 --> 19:45.942
24/7, 365, at a million percent.

19:46.103 --> 19:48.790
And if you think that there's something
behind that, then you're crazy.

19:48.814 --> 19:49.824
Good night, Alfred.

19:49.982 --> 19:51.192
Sir, it's morning.

19:53.944 --> 19:57.954
Master Bruce, you live on an island,
figuratively and literally.

19:58.115 --> 19:59.365
<i>Yeah. I love it.</i>

19:59.533 --> 20:01.253
You can't spend
the rest of your life alone,

20:01.410 --> 20:02.540
dressed in black,

20:02.703 --> 20:04.963
listening to angry music,
and staying up all night.

20:05.122 --> 20:07.622
Yes, I can, 'cause I'm Batman.

20:07.791 --> 20:10.841
But don't you think it's time

20:11.003 --> 20:14.053
you finally faced your greatest fear?

20:14.214 --> 20:15.224
- Snakes?
- No.

20:15.382 --> 20:16.382
- Clowns?
- No.

20:16.550 --> 20:17.630
Snake clowns?

20:17.801 --> 20:18.971
Bruce, listen.

20:20.053 --> 20:22.183
Your greatest fear is

20:23.307 --> 20:25.727
being a part of a family again.

20:35.193 --> 20:38.163
Nope. Now it's snake clowns,
because you put that idea in my head.

20:38.322 --> 20:39.742
- Sir?
- Time for push-ups!

20:39.907 --> 20:41.827
One, two... We're going to 1,000.

20:41.992 --> 20:43.452
I'm afraid that's not possible, sir.

20:43.619 --> 20:45.409
It is possible. I'm already at 20.

20:45.579 --> 20:48.329
You're scheduled to go to
Jim Gordon's retirement party.

20:48.498 --> 20:51.628
What? No. I don't wanna do that.

20:51.793 --> 20:53.753
- You're going to have a great time!
- No, no, no.

20:53.795 --> 20:55.045
You might meet some new people!

20:55.213 --> 20:56.383
No, no, no!

20:56.548 --> 20:57.775
You could even make some new friends.

20:57.799 --> 21:01.469
No, no, no, no. No, no, no, no.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

21:01.678 --> 21:03.848
No!

21:04.014 --> 21:06.774
And before you go,
we can do your favorite thing.

21:07.017 --> 21:09.017
Tuxedo dress-up party.

21:18.278 --> 21:20.028
Sir, aren't you forgetting something?

21:20.238 --> 21:22.278
- Nope.
- Your cowl.

21:22.449 --> 21:23.699
My what, now?

21:23.867 --> 21:27.287
Your armored face disguise?

21:29.539 --> 21:30.539
Fine.

21:32.417 --> 21:34.287
- Happy now?
- Indubitably.

21:34.461 --> 21:36.511
Good. Must be nice to be happy.

21:36.672 --> 21:38.922
<i>Tonight, on</i> Metropolis in Focus,

21:39.174 --> 21:41.594
<i>we have our favorite star, Superman!</i>

21:41.760 --> 21:43.510
<i>What up, Gotham!</i>

21:44.972 --> 21:47.022
<i>Superman, tell me.
How do you feel</i>

21:47.182 --> 21:50.192
<i>about your recent banishment
of Zod to the Phantom Zone?</i>

21:50.352 --> 21:53.652
<i>Yeah, look, Pippa, it's...
It's complicated. Okay?</i>

21:53.814 --> 21:57.784
<i>Zod and I, we've had some
pretty epic battles over the years.</i>

21:59.486 --> 22:02.566
<i>I don't believe I would be Superman
without fighting Zod.</i>

22:02.739 --> 22:07.119
See? Superman gets it.
Why can't Batman?

22:07.285 --> 22:10.865
Check it out, guys.
I built a CD rack. Ta-da!

22:12.749 --> 22:14.999
And how am I supposed to get
Batman's respect

22:15.168 --> 22:18.128
when I'm working
with these human farts?

22:18.296 --> 22:19.916
Boo-boo, look at me.

22:20.382 --> 22:23.512
You're too good for Batman.
He needs to open his eyes

22:23.677 --> 22:26.097
and see what it feels like
when you're not around. Okay?

22:26.263 --> 22:29.273
<i>Yeah, Pippa. I couldn't put Zod
in a regular prison, right?</i>

22:29.433 --> 22:30.853
<i>He's Zod. Come on!</i>

22:31.476 --> 22:32.636
<i>No, he needed to go someplace</i>

22:32.769 --> 22:35.609
<i>where he could never harm
Metropolis ever again.</i>

22:36.982 --> 22:38.232
<i>The Phantom Zone.</i>

22:38.400 --> 22:40.440
<i>Ah, yes, the notorious space jail</i>

22:40.610 --> 22:42.990
<i>that houses the greatest
super-villains of all time.</i>

22:43.155 --> 22:45.945
<i>They've got, like,
the sickest baddies up there.</i>

22:46.116 --> 22:47.196
<i>They got, like, this guy.</i>

22:47.367 --> 22:49.157
- And her.
<i>- I'll get you, my pretty!</i>

22:49.327 --> 22:51.787
<i>- To say nothing about him.</i>
- Wingardium Leviosa!

22:51.955 --> 22:52.955
<i>And these guys.</i>

22:53.123 --> 22:54.123
<i>Exterminate!</i>

22:54.291 --> 22:57.631
I'm starting to get an idea,
monkey face.

23:03.133 --> 23:04.133
Bruce, over here!

23:04.301 --> 23:05.778
Okay, shutterbugs.
Look alive, here we go.

23:05.802 --> 23:07.113
I'm gonna give you three poses. You ready?

23:07.137 --> 23:08.137
Kissy face.

23:08.305 --> 23:09.555
Oops, I did it again.

23:09.723 --> 23:11.813
And the Bad Boys. What you gonna do?

23:11.975 --> 23:14.135
I'm out of here, guys. Thank you.

23:14.311 --> 23:16.731
- Congresswoman.
- Mr. Wayne, good to see you.

23:17.147 --> 23:18.477
<i>- Senator, looking great.
- Bruce.</i>

23:18.732 --> 23:21.992
<i>I'm starting with
the man in the mirror</i>

23:22.152 --> 23:23.671
Bruce, any advice
for the new commissioner?

23:23.695 --> 23:26.382
Long as he knows how to push the button
for the Bat-Signal, he'll be fine.

23:26.406 --> 23:27.906
Bruce, I don't know how you did it.

23:28.075 --> 23:29.555
You can't prove it, you didn't do it.

23:29.659 --> 23:31.304
Mr. Wayne, so great to see you!
Come and join us!

23:31.328 --> 23:32.658
Mr. Prime Minister.

23:32.829 --> 23:34.159
Did you have some work done?

23:36.124 --> 23:37.134
No way!

23:38.627 --> 23:39.837
<i>Bruce Wayne!</i>

23:40.003 --> 23:41.803
He's the greatest orphan of all time.

23:41.963 --> 23:44.843
<i>Shamon
Shamon</i>

23:45.008 --> 23:47.048
- Nice to see you, Mr. Ambassador.
- Mr. Wayne!

23:47.219 --> 23:49.049
- You want a picture?
- That would be swell!

23:49.221 --> 23:50.811
Here we go. Party face!

23:50.972 --> 23:52.272
Boom. Keep it.

23:52.432 --> 23:53.432
Whoa! Thanks, Mr. Wayne.

23:53.600 --> 23:54.640
Call me Bruce, champ.

23:54.810 --> 23:56.270
I'm just so jazzed to meet you, sir.

23:56.436 --> 23:57.846
I'm sorry, did you say "jazzed"?

23:58.021 --> 23:59.651
Yes! My name's Richard Grayson,

23:59.815 --> 24:01.501
but all the kids at the orphanage
call me Dick.

24:01.525 --> 24:03.145
- Well, children can be cruel.
- Yeah.

24:03.318 --> 24:04.670
- Great to see you, Bruce.
- Nice to see you, sir.

24:04.694 --> 24:07.054
- So, I had a question for you, sir.
- Okay, hit me with it.

24:07.155 --> 24:08.915
Do you have any advice
on how to get adopted?

24:08.990 --> 24:10.200
- Oh, yeah.
- Oh, you do?

24:10.367 --> 24:11.844
- Mr. Wayne, can I get an autograph?
- Sure.

24:11.868 --> 24:14.149
Um, all right, for example,
is teeth whitener a good idea?

24:14.204 --> 24:15.564
- Yes. There you go, pal.
- Thanks!

24:15.622 --> 24:16.622
- Really?
- Oh, yeah.

24:16.790 --> 24:18.470
- Looking good, Bruce.
- Thank you so much.

24:18.500 --> 24:20.340
How about eyeliner
or a foreign language?

24:20.502 --> 24:21.882
- Try both.
<i>- Bueno.</i>

24:22.045 --> 24:23.335
Look, it's the new commissioner!

24:23.505 --> 24:25.525
- Where? Oh, she's with the mayor!
- Okay. Let's see.

24:25.549 --> 24:26.799
Here she is, everyone!

24:26.967 --> 24:28.387
- Oh, my darling!
- Hi, Dad.

24:34.015 --> 24:35.015
Mr. Wayne?

24:35.767 --> 24:38.147
Should I get experimental surgery
to make my eyes larger

24:38.311 --> 24:39.691
and more vulnerable-looking?

24:40.856 --> 24:42.396
Uh, do that.

24:51.158 --> 24:52.738
Uh, Mr. Wayne?

24:52.909 --> 24:55.159
Are you currently in the market
to adopt a child?

24:55.662 --> 24:57.082
- Yeah.
- Really?

24:57.247 --> 24:58.917
- Oh, yeah.
- Wow.

24:59.082 --> 25:00.893
Are you looking for more
of a base model orphan

25:00.917 --> 25:03.167
- or one that has more upgraded features?
- Yep.

25:03.336 --> 25:04.666
Like cooking or driftwood art?

25:04.838 --> 25:06.107
- Gymnastic abilities?
- Yep. Yep.

25:06.131 --> 25:07.801
Close-up street magic à la David Blaine?

25:07.966 --> 25:09.756
- All of it sounds great.
- Really?

25:09.926 --> 25:13.346
Because all of it sounds like me.

25:13.513 --> 25:16.353
Mr. Wayne, do you think you'd be
interested in adopting me

25:16.516 --> 25:18.186
as your future orphan son?

25:18.351 --> 25:19.351
Definitely.

25:19.519 --> 25:20.809
Oh, this is great!

25:20.979 --> 25:24.229
Because all I want is to get adopted,
so I can finally stop being

25:26.818 --> 25:28.108
alone.

25:29.321 --> 25:30.590
<i>We've gathered here tonight</i>

25:30.614 --> 25:32.784
<i>to mark the retirement of Jim Gordon.</i>

25:32.949 --> 25:33.949
Goodbye.

25:34.117 --> 25:38.827
<i>And we wish him well
on his South African jungle safari!</i>

25:38.997 --> 25:40.037
Thank you.

25:40.290 --> 25:41.960
<i>Now, to introduce you</i>

25:42.125 --> 25:44.125
<i>to his exciting new replacement.</i>

25:44.294 --> 25:46.884
<i>Everyone, meet your new commissioner!</i>

25:49.174 --> 25:51.434
<i>Meet Barbara Gordon!</i>

25:51.593 --> 25:55.813
<i>- The new commissioner of Gotham City!</i>
- Whoa!

25:55.972 --> 25:59.482
<i>She was top of her class
at Harvard for Police.</i>

25:59.643 --> 26:03.443
<i>She cleaned up the streets
of Gotham's nearby sister city Blüdhaven</i>

26:03.605 --> 26:05.475
<i>using statistics</i>

26:06.149 --> 26:07.939
<i>and compassion.</i>

26:08.109 --> 26:10.779
<i>And now she's bringing her new ideas</i>

26:10.946 --> 26:14.566
<i>and her nunchucks to Gotham City.</i>

26:14.741 --> 26:16.661
Congratulations, darling.

26:16.826 --> 26:18.746
- Thanks, Dad.
- Here she is, everyone!

26:18.912 --> 26:20.252
Thank you! Thanks!

26:20.413 --> 26:21.623
Hurray!

26:21.790 --> 26:22.870
Ms. Gordon, over here!

26:23.041 --> 26:24.421
- Big smile!
- Wow.

26:24.584 --> 26:27.254
<i>Thank you for the oversized key
to Arkham Asylum.</i>

26:27.420 --> 26:29.210
<i>And, uh, what's this?</i>

26:29.381 --> 26:32.681
<i>Thank you for the switch
to the Bat-Signal.</i>

26:32.842 --> 26:34.052
<i>Nice.</i>

26:35.512 --> 26:40.432
<i>Dad, you've always done a great job
protecting Gotham City.</i>

26:40.600 --> 26:42.730
Flip! That's me.

26:42.894 --> 26:45.564
<i>Thank you.
Along with Batman, of course.</i>

26:45.730 --> 26:47.190
Whoo! Let's hear it for Batman!

26:47.357 --> 26:48.977
<i>Who I wish was here right now.</i>

26:49.150 --> 26:50.690
Oh, I'm sure he's listening.

26:50.860 --> 26:52.530
<i>I'd like to ask all of you a question.</i>

26:52.696 --> 26:54.696
<i>Are you fed up with crime?</i>

26:54.990 --> 26:57.260
- Uh-huh. We're all tired of crime.
- Yeah, we're sick of it.

26:57.284 --> 26:59.544
<i>Great. Then let's talk about
real improvements</i>

26:59.703 --> 27:01.543
<i>that will end the cycle of crime.</i>

27:01.871 --> 27:05.291
<i>I've got a four-point pilot program
that I'd love to share with you.</i>

27:05.458 --> 27:07.038
I wanna hear all four points.

27:07.210 --> 27:08.380
<i>- It's called...</i>
- I am ready.

27:08.545 --> 27:09.545
<i>It takes a village...</i>

27:09.713 --> 27:10.923
Best opening to a title ever.

27:11.089 --> 27:12.589
<i>Not a Batman.</i>

27:13.383 --> 27:14.383
- Waiter.
- Sir?

27:14.551 --> 27:15.551
- Can I?
- Of course.

27:15.719 --> 27:16.889
- Thank you.
- My pleasure.

27:17.053 --> 27:18.053
Thanks so much.

27:20.390 --> 27:21.980
- What?
<i>- Look.</i>

27:22.142 --> 27:26.062
<i>Batman's been on the job
for a very, very, very,</i>

27:26.229 --> 27:29.569
<i>very, very, very, very, very long time.</i>

27:29.733 --> 27:31.403
He has aged phenomenally.

27:31.568 --> 27:35.568
<i>However, despite all the great work
Batman has done for us,</i>

27:35.739 --> 27:40.409
<i>Gotham City is still the most
crime-ridden city in the world.</i>

27:40.577 --> 27:41.804
- She's got a great point.
- Interesting.

27:41.828 --> 27:43.708
Historically speaking, that is accurate.

27:43.913 --> 27:45.766
<i>- He hasn't captured Riddler.
- You know, she's right.</i>

27:45.790 --> 27:46.880
<i>He hasn't captured Bane.</i>

27:47.042 --> 27:48.962
- Huh!
<i>- Or Catwoman.</i>

27:49.127 --> 27:53.087
<i>Or Two-Face,
or any of Gotham's other villains!</i>

27:53.256 --> 27:54.256
He's not good at his job.

27:54.424 --> 27:55.884
<i>Including the Joker!</i>

27:56.051 --> 27:57.931
She's making a lot of sense.

27:58.178 --> 27:59.758
Excuse me. I'm so sorry. Excuse me.

27:59.929 --> 28:01.389
<i>We love you, Barbara!</i>

28:01.598 --> 28:03.348
<i>- Yes.</i>
- Hi. Bruce Wayne.

28:03.516 --> 28:05.936
Billionaire, bon vivant,
gallivanter, playboy,

28:06.102 --> 28:08.772
Gotham's most eligible bachelor,
like, 90 years in a row.

28:08.938 --> 28:10.958
<i>- That's me right there.
- I know who you are, Mr. Wayne.</i>

28:10.982 --> 28:15.112
You bet you do. Quick quest,
what is your problem with Batman,

28:15.278 --> 28:17.608
and also, what the heck, dude?

28:17.781 --> 28:19.241
<i>I'm glad you asked, Mr. Wayne.</i>

28:19.407 --> 28:21.447
<i>I'm not a Batman hater.</i>

28:21.618 --> 28:24.038
<i>But we don't need
an unsupervised adult man</i>

28:24.204 --> 28:26.834
<i>karate-chopping poor people
in a Halloween costume.</i>

28:27.207 --> 28:29.787
<i>We need to take
what's good about Batman...</i>

28:30.001 --> 28:34.551
<i>...and marry it to actual laws
and proper ethics</i>

28:34.714 --> 28:35.884
<i>and accountability.</i>

28:36.299 --> 28:37.579
I hate everything you just said.

28:37.634 --> 28:42.564
<i>Because my dream is for the police force
to team up with Batman.</i>

28:42.722 --> 28:43.722
Waiter.

28:43.890 --> 28:45.640
<i>Wouldn't that be better?</i>

28:45.809 --> 28:49.019
<i>And I know that, together,
the world's greatest detective...</i>

28:49.687 --> 28:51.607
<i>...and Gotham's finest</i>

28:51.815 --> 28:53.815
<i>could clean up
these crime-ridden streets.</i>

28:56.152 --> 28:57.282
<i>Forever.</i>

28:57.445 --> 28:58.905
Everybody, get down!

29:01.324 --> 29:03.334
Grand entrance!

29:03.827 --> 29:06.287
<i>Everyone! Make your way
to the exits immediately!</i>

29:06.496 --> 29:07.706
Run!

29:07.872 --> 29:09.832
Team Bane, block the exits.

29:09.999 --> 29:11.249
Going somewhere?

29:11.501 --> 29:14.211
Clayface, Freeze, bring me
the new Commissioner Gordon.

29:14.379 --> 29:16.009
- We're on it.
- Cool.

29:16.172 --> 29:17.882
And, Harley, you know what to do.

29:18.049 --> 29:19.049
I sure do.

29:19.259 --> 29:22.799
It's time for Operation
"Take Out the Laundry."

29:23.054 --> 29:25.974
Butler One, this is Bat One.
Do you copy?

29:26.182 --> 29:28.982
- Go ahead, Bat One.
<i>- I need my armored face disguise, now!</i>

29:29.144 --> 29:30.384
Only if you say the magic word.

29:30.520 --> 29:31.600
- Now!
<i>- No.</i>

29:31.771 --> 29:34.521
- You're fired.
- No. Sir, we'll talk about this

29:34.691 --> 29:35.731
back at the Batcave.

29:38.027 --> 29:39.067
- Hey, 'Puter.
<i>- Yes?</i>

29:39.237 --> 29:40.947
Initialize masterbuild music.

29:41.114 --> 29:42.284
<i>Right away.</i>

29:42.949 --> 29:46.039
<i>Collateral damage assessment
suggests the Scuttler, sir.</i>

29:46.202 --> 29:47.332
Good plan.

29:52.208 --> 29:54.208
Madam Mayor, stay close to me.

29:54.377 --> 29:55.377
Head for the south exit.

29:55.920 --> 29:57.010
Now, ma'am.

29:59.132 --> 30:00.132
Go! Go! Go!

30:00.300 --> 30:01.720
Honey, let Batman take care of it.

30:01.885 --> 30:03.215
Dad, I got this.

30:15.565 --> 30:17.065
<i>Scuttler online.</i>

30:17.233 --> 30:19.363
Chief O'Hara, we're coming in hot!

30:19.527 --> 30:21.027
I'm almost there.

30:25.575 --> 30:27.115
Chief, get the mayor to safety.

30:28.244 --> 30:30.544
Computer,
I've got the Joker in my sights.

30:30.705 --> 30:32.745
Team, I got the Joker in my sights.

30:37.253 --> 30:38.253
Joker!

30:38.421 --> 30:39.421
Joker.

30:39.589 --> 30:41.169
Uh, excuse me? I was about to...

30:41.341 --> 30:44.091
Push the Bat-Signal? Good call.
I like your instincts.

30:44.260 --> 30:46.220
I've got a surprise for you guys.

30:46.387 --> 30:48.427
And it's gonna make you smile.

30:48.598 --> 30:50.598
Uh-oh! His smile is our grimace.

30:50.767 --> 30:51.767
<i>Everybody, get down.</i>

30:51.935 --> 30:53.685
- I...
- Joker, no!

30:54.604 --> 30:55.774
...surrender.

30:56.147 --> 30:57.607
What?

30:58.566 --> 31:00.396
Uh, what did you just say?

31:00.568 --> 31:03.818
I said, "I surrender."

31:03.988 --> 31:05.108
Joker, what are you doing?

31:05.448 --> 31:07.208
I'm sorry, my Bat-ears
must be malfunctioning

31:07.367 --> 31:08.367
because it sounds...

31:08.535 --> 31:09.535
I surrender!

31:09.702 --> 31:12.122
Okay, you know what? Cool it.
You're a criminal.

31:12.288 --> 31:14.328
You run, and I catch you.

31:14.499 --> 31:15.789
Not anymore, Batman.

31:15.959 --> 31:17.999
You were right. There is no "us."

31:18.169 --> 31:21.459
So, there's no point
in me trying to fight you anymore.

31:21.631 --> 31:23.971
Therefore, I will be surrendering myself

31:24.133 --> 31:26.843
to our strong-willed and
forward-thinking new commissioner.

31:27.011 --> 31:28.697
Blink, blink, blink.
Blinkety blink, blink, blink!

31:28.721 --> 31:29.721
That's really suspicious.

31:29.889 --> 31:32.099
Yeah, it is. What are you up to, Joker?

31:32.267 --> 31:34.727
I just wanna go to Arkham
and pay for all of my crimes.

31:34.894 --> 31:36.622
Blink, blink, blink.
Blinkety blink, blink, blink!

31:36.646 --> 31:38.686
Are you actually saying "blink"?

31:38.856 --> 31:40.146
No! Blink, blink, blink.

31:40.316 --> 31:41.316
<i>Joker! That's enough.</i>

31:41.484 --> 31:43.034
Okay, Babs. I got this.

31:43.194 --> 31:46.664
Not so fast, Batman.
You can't fight me anymore.

31:46.823 --> 31:47.823
I'm off the market.

31:47.991 --> 31:49.701
What are you talking about?

31:49.867 --> 31:51.697
I'm off the menu.

31:51.869 --> 31:54.659
You won't get to fight
any of this anymore.

31:54.998 --> 31:56.668
Man, am I sorry I asked.

31:56.833 --> 31:59.673
Anyway, have fun in jail and...

31:59.836 --> 32:01.046
Batman, what are you doing?

32:01.296 --> 32:03.046
Punching Bane.

32:03.214 --> 32:04.844
That was unnecessary.

32:05.008 --> 32:07.298
Oh, no, you can't fight Bane
anymore either.

32:07.468 --> 32:08.548
Really?

32:08.720 --> 32:10.680
Yeah. Or Riddler.

32:10.847 --> 32:12.347
Or Catwoman. Or Condiment King.

32:13.099 --> 32:14.099
Why not?

32:14.267 --> 32:18.017
Because we're all surrendering.
Right, guys?

32:18.187 --> 32:19.187
We are?

32:19.355 --> 32:20.475
Yes!

32:27.989 --> 32:30.529
<i>Riddle me this.
What just happened?</i>

32:30.908 --> 32:32.368
It's the end of crime!

32:32.910 --> 32:33.910
All right!

32:34.037 --> 32:35.222
- That was amazing!
- Over here, over here!

32:35.246 --> 32:37.326
- You did it!
- Yeah, of course I did. I'm...

32:37.540 --> 32:40.080
Sorry, not you.
We're talking to Commissioner Gordon.

32:40.251 --> 32:42.211
- Well, it was a team effort.
- I got this, Babs.

32:42.378 --> 32:43.758
Commissioner, how do you feel?

32:43.921 --> 32:46.011
Amazing! This is a great first day.

32:46.174 --> 32:47.344
Okay.

32:47.508 --> 32:48.718
- Question for Batman.
- Shoot.

32:48.885 --> 32:50.404
What are you gonna do
with the rest of your life?

32:50.428 --> 32:51.968
What do you mean,
the rest of my life?

32:52.138 --> 32:55.018
We don't need a vigilante crime fighter
now that there's no more crime.

32:55.183 --> 32:56.233
Uh, yes, you do.

32:56.392 --> 32:58.812
You can spend some quality time
with your family.

32:59.771 --> 33:00.771
My...

33:05.485 --> 33:07.945
Okay, Batman. We'll take it from here.

33:08.112 --> 33:09.242
All right, listen up.

33:09.405 --> 33:11.695
All of you have
the right to remain silent.

33:11.866 --> 33:12.906
Let's roll out!

33:13.076 --> 33:14.076
Toodle-oo, Batman!

33:14.243 --> 33:15.603
- Bye, Batman.
<i>- Au revoir,</i> Batman.

33:15.745 --> 33:16.745
<i>Bye, Batman.</i>

33:16.913 --> 33:18.253
<i>Bye, Batman!</i>

33:24.671 --> 33:26.921
<i>Today is a victory</i>

33:27.090 --> 33:30.260
<i>for the citizens of Gotham City!</i>

33:31.094 --> 33:34.104
No more crime!
No more crime! No more crime!

33:34.263 --> 33:37.273
No more crime! No more crime!
No more crime!

33:37.433 --> 33:40.733
No more crime! No more crime!
No more crime!

33:44.607 --> 33:45.777
Is everything okay, sir?

33:45.942 --> 33:47.702
You've barely touched
your lobster thermidor.

33:47.777 --> 33:50.777
I don't have time to eat
lobster thermidor right now!

33:54.450 --> 33:55.790
Warrior two.

33:55.952 --> 33:58.832
Pigeon pose. Tree pose.

34:03.000 --> 34:04.130
Tree pose.

34:04.293 --> 34:05.343
Hey, Batman!

34:05.503 --> 34:06.673
Barbara!

34:06.838 --> 34:07.838
What are you doing?

34:08.005 --> 34:09.795
Nothing. I have a very full life.

34:09.966 --> 34:12.466
No, I mean, what are you doing here?

34:12.635 --> 34:15.804
Surveillance. On the Joker.

34:15.972 --> 34:18.891
Batman, we both know
the Joker's up to something.

34:19.058 --> 34:21.728
Well, then we can't just let him
run around loose in a prison.

34:21.893 --> 34:23.154
He's not loose.

34:23.312 --> 34:25.482
He has to go someplace outside the law.

34:25.648 --> 34:27.318
- Outside the law?
- Yeah.

34:27.525 --> 34:29.485
Somewhere like, uh...

34:29.652 --> 34:32.742
Hi, there. I'm here
from Phantom's Own Laundry.

34:32.905 --> 34:34.864
Here to take that bad stuff
off your hands.

34:35.032 --> 34:37.661
Wait, that's it! The Phantom Zone.

34:37.827 --> 34:39.657
The Phantom Zone? No way!

34:39.829 --> 34:43.418
That is super illegal
and way outside our jurisdiction.

34:43.791 --> 34:47.041
So, why don't you and I work together

34:47.210 --> 34:49.710
inside the law,
to figure out what he's up to?

34:49.880 --> 34:52.681
Batman works alone.
That's my motto. Copyright Batman.

34:54.010 --> 34:58.100
Batman, there are no more vigilantes
allowed in Gotham City.

34:58.264 --> 34:59.724
Okay. Totally got it.

34:59.891 --> 35:03.351
Then I have to go into
double-secret super vigilante mode.

35:03.895 --> 35:05.895
You said that out loud.

35:06.522 --> 35:09.402
I know that she said I said that out loud,
but there's no way I did.

35:09.567 --> 35:12.527
She has no idea what's going on
in my super-mind.

35:12.695 --> 35:14.355
Super-mind?

35:14.614 --> 35:15.954
Smoke bomb!

35:20.870 --> 35:23.710
Computer, how do I put the Joker
in the Phantom Zone?

35:23.873 --> 35:25.963
Quickest route, no freeways.

35:29.170 --> 35:30.460
'Puter, do you hear me?

35:32.965 --> 35:34.625
Hello, Master Bruce.

35:34.801 --> 35:37.361
Alfred, there's something wrong
with the Batcomputer. Watch this.

35:37.512 --> 35:39.222
'Puter. Nothing.

35:39.388 --> 35:41.138
'Puter. Do you see what I'm saying?

35:41.307 --> 35:42.659
There's nothing wrong with it, sir.

35:42.683 --> 35:45.273
I have just taken away
your computer privileges.

35:48.189 --> 35:49.979
The parental lock? You can't do that.

35:50.149 --> 35:52.359
Oh, I can. I've been reading

35:52.527 --> 35:54.897
<i>Setting Limits
for Your Out-of-Control Child.</i>

35:55.071 --> 35:56.271
You know what? Doesn't matter,

35:56.322 --> 35:58.042
'cause I have
a double-secret super password

35:58.157 --> 35:59.657
that unlocks the parental lock.

35:59.826 --> 36:03.116
You mean, "Alfred da Butt-ler,"
with two T's?

36:04.580 --> 36:06.960
Sir, it's time for you
to stop this unhealthy behavior.

36:07.124 --> 36:08.584
No, it's not.

36:08.751 --> 36:10.437
You need to take responsibility
for your life.

36:10.461 --> 36:11.921
Not right now, I don't.

36:12.088 --> 36:14.718
And it starts by raising your son.

36:17.969 --> 36:18.969
I'm sorry.

36:19.136 --> 36:21.926
I literally have no idea
what you're talking about.

36:22.098 --> 36:25.058
The young orphan you adopted
at the gala. Remember?

36:27.353 --> 36:30.363
<i>Wow! Stairs. Whee!</i>

36:30.773 --> 36:32.983
He's been living here for the past week.

36:33.150 --> 36:35.780
<i>Hello, table! Boom!</i>

36:36.028 --> 36:39.568
<i>And I must say,
I've grown rather fond of the young lad.</i>

36:39.740 --> 36:41.660
<i>Hello, secret camera.</i>

36:41.826 --> 36:42.906
<i>You should get to know him.</i>

36:43.035 --> 36:44.575
<i>We are family</i>

36:44.745 --> 36:47.285
<i>- You and he have a lot in common.
- En garde.</i>

36:49.208 --> 36:50.958
Hello, family photos.

36:51.127 --> 36:53.547
<i>He lost his parents
at a very young age.</i>

36:55.172 --> 36:56.922
I've always wanted one of those.

36:59.093 --> 37:03.063
Doesn't he deserve a chance for someone
to take him under their wing,

37:04.098 --> 37:07.308
as I took you under mine?

37:10.438 --> 37:13.148
Alfred, you've been watching
way too many Lifetime movies

37:13.316 --> 37:14.316
and drinking chardonnay.

37:14.483 --> 37:16.163
- It's Pinot grigio, sir.
- Whatever it is.

37:16.235 --> 37:18.275
Listen, you don't have a family.

37:18.487 --> 37:19.857
You're satisfied serving me.

37:20.531 --> 37:22.871
<i>So what do you know about
having a surrogate son?</i>

37:23.451 --> 37:25.081
<i>Now, I'm gonna go fight crime</i>

37:25.244 --> 37:28.164
while you put that kid on the next jet
to the orphanage. Got it?

37:29.999 --> 37:31.129
As you wish, sir.

37:32.835 --> 37:34.245
Whoops-a-daisy.

37:35.796 --> 37:36.876
<i>Wait, what are you doing?</i>

37:37.048 --> 37:38.048
Dusting.

37:38.215 --> 37:39.401
You can't let him into the Batcave!

37:39.425 --> 37:42.545
I'm not. I'm letting him into your life

37:42.762 --> 37:44.262
via the Batcave.

37:54.273 --> 37:55.273
What?

37:56.901 --> 37:58.951
It's the Batcave!

37:59.362 --> 38:01.862
Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh.

38:02.031 --> 38:04.031
Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh.
Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh.

38:04.200 --> 38:06.740
Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh.
Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh.

38:09.372 --> 38:11.542
Batman! Whoa!

38:11.707 --> 38:12.877
You're darn right, "Whoa."

38:13.042 --> 38:15.382
Wait, does Batman live
in Bruce Wayne's basement?

38:15.544 --> 38:17.714
No. Bruce Wayne lives in Batman's attic.

38:17.880 --> 38:19.970
- We can have sleepovers every night!
- No, we can't.

38:20.132 --> 38:22.332
- Wow! Look, it's the Bat-Sub!
- Wait, don't touch that!

38:22.385 --> 38:23.737
Over there, it's the Bat-Space shuttle.

38:23.761 --> 38:24.905
Please, keep your hands off that.

38:24.929 --> 38:26.531
- Look, it's the Bat-Zeppelin!
- Don't touch that either!

38:26.555 --> 38:27.595
- It's the Bat-Train!
- No!

38:27.723 --> 38:28.893
- It's the Bat-Kayak.
<i>- No!</i>

38:29.058 --> 38:30.202
- It's the Bat-Dune buggy.
<i>- No!</i>

38:30.226 --> 38:32.056
It's the Bat shark repellent?

38:33.896 --> 38:36.896
Uh, actually, you can touch that.
It's completely useless.

38:37.066 --> 38:38.396
Whoa! Thanks, Batman!

38:38.609 --> 38:40.779
Please, stand over there.

38:40.945 --> 38:43.485
And don't touch, look at, or do anything

38:43.656 --> 38:45.550
for the remaining moments
you have in my presence.

38:45.574 --> 38:46.584
Okay, cool.

38:46.742 --> 38:48.202
- Computer.
<i>- Go ahead.</i>

38:48.369 --> 38:50.499
How do I put the Joker
in the Phantom Zone?

38:50.663 --> 38:52.753
<i>Joker can only be put in the Phantom Zone</i>

38:52.915 --> 38:54.455
<i>using the Phantom Zone Projector.</i>

38:54.625 --> 38:55.875
<i>Current location,</i>

38:56.043 --> 38:58.093
<i>Superman's Fortress of Solitude</i>

38:58.254 --> 39:00.264
<i>inside the Atomic Cauldron.</i>

39:00.423 --> 39:04.843
<i>However, only a person that isn't
shredded, ripped, or extremely swoll</i>

39:05.011 --> 39:06.221
<i>can enter the cauldron.</i>

39:06.429 --> 39:08.099
Ugh, I'm way too buff.

39:08.264 --> 39:10.024
<i>You also have beautiful abs, sir.</i>

39:10.182 --> 39:11.562
That's my cross to bear.

39:11.726 --> 39:13.846
<i>Additionally, once inside the cauldron,</i>

39:14.020 --> 39:16.610
<i>multiple Kryptonian
defense systems engage,</i>

39:16.772 --> 39:19.072
<i>including the Acid Moat,
Ring of Napalm,</i>

39:19.233 --> 39:20.533
<i>and the Jaws of Death.</i>

39:20.693 --> 39:24.163
<i>Chance of total mission failure is 110%.</i>

39:24.321 --> 39:26.621
Those are not great odds.

39:26.782 --> 39:27.782
Wait a minute.

39:27.950 --> 39:29.120
- Hey, kid.
- Yes, sir?

39:29.285 --> 39:30.945
- You're super nimble, right?
- I sure am!

39:31.120 --> 39:32.200
- And small?
- Very.

39:32.371 --> 39:34.041
- And quiet?
- When I desire to be.

39:34.206 --> 39:36.126
And 110% expendable?

39:36.292 --> 39:38.042
I don't know what that means,
but okay.

39:38.210 --> 39:39.800
Great. Follow me.

39:39.962 --> 39:42.802
We are gonna steal
the Phantom Zone Projector from Superman.

39:42.965 --> 39:43.965
- Steal?
- Yeah.

39:44.133 --> 39:45.723
We have to right a wrong.

39:45.885 --> 39:48.795
And, sometimes, in order to right a wrong,
you have to do a wrong-right.

39:48.971 --> 39:49.971
Gandhi said that.

39:50.139 --> 39:51.389
Are we sure Gandhi said that?

39:51.557 --> 39:53.227
- I'm paraphrasing.
- Cool!

39:53.392 --> 39:55.392
<i>Preparing Fortress of Solitude
infiltration gear.</i>

39:55.561 --> 39:56.901
Wow! Look at all these!

39:57.063 --> 39:58.623
Do I get a costume for the mission, too?

39:58.647 --> 40:01.107
I got a feeling that you'll just look
like a kid on Halloween.

40:01.317 --> 40:02.317
Don't you think?

40:02.526 --> 40:03.566
Don't touch that.

40:03.778 --> 40:05.818
Whoo-hoo!

40:05.988 --> 40:07.132
<i>- El Mariachi.
- I like that one!</i>

40:07.156 --> 40:08.675
<i>- That one is culturally insensitive.
- Night Terror.</i>

40:08.699 --> 40:09.699
- That one!
<i>- No way.</i>

40:09.867 --> 40:10.987
- This one?
<i>- Death Merchant.</i>

40:11.077 --> 40:12.077
<i>- No.</i>
- I'm okay.

40:12.244 --> 40:13.334
- This one.
<i>- Fire Starter.</i>

40:13.496 --> 40:14.906
- This one.
<i>- Clawed Reigns.</i>

40:15.081 --> 40:16.421
<i>- Excali-Bat.</i>
- This one?

40:16.582 --> 40:17.922
<i>- Silent but Deadly.
- Nope.</i>

40:18.084 --> 40:19.674
<i>Bat-ryshnikov.</i>

40:19.835 --> 40:21.035
How do we feel about this one?

40:21.087 --> 40:23.007
Dress-up parties are for grown-ups only.

40:23.172 --> 40:24.342
Wait. What's that one there?

40:24.507 --> 40:25.901
<i>That one was for
the assignment called</i>

40:25.925 --> 40:27.125
<i>The Jamaican Caper.</i>

40:27.301 --> 40:29.301
<i>The locals called me Reggae Man.</i>

40:29.470 --> 40:30.600
I love it!

40:30.763 --> 40:32.603
Ah! Feels like I was poured into this.

40:32.765 --> 40:33.845
My only trouble is,

40:34.433 --> 40:36.023
these pants are just a little tight.

40:36.185 --> 40:38.305
I don't know if I could throw a kick
or jump in them.

40:38.479 --> 40:41.149
I got an idea. Rip! That's better!

40:41.315 --> 40:42.685
Now I'm free, now I'm moving.

40:42.858 --> 40:44.858
Come on, Batman. Let's get grooving!

40:45.111 --> 40:47.071
I can only look you
in the eyes right now.

40:47.238 --> 40:49.698
- Sir, what are you doing?
- What do you mean?

40:49.949 --> 40:52.079
Why is Master Dick dressed like that?

40:52.284 --> 40:55.874
How dare you tell me
how to parent my kid I just met?

40:56.038 --> 40:57.038
To the Batmobile!

40:57.206 --> 40:58.366
Hot-diggity-dog!

41:01.210 --> 41:03.050
<i>Vehicle rotisserie engaged.</i>

41:03.587 --> 41:05.757
<i>Retrieving the Speedwagon.</i>

41:06.757 --> 41:08.377
<i>Atomic batteries to power.</i>

41:08.551 --> 41:09.591
<i>Turbines to speed.</i>

41:10.010 --> 41:11.600
Hey, kid. Let's go.

41:12.221 --> 41:13.891
- Oh, shoot!
- What?

41:14.598 --> 41:16.558
I probably shouldn't leave

41:16.725 --> 41:20.395
until I get the thumbs up
from my new old man, Bruce Wayne.

41:21.981 --> 41:24.191
Uh, yeah. Here's the thing.

41:26.068 --> 41:28.448
Bruno and I decided

41:28.612 --> 41:30.532
to share custody of you.

41:30.698 --> 41:32.658
So I get a say

41:32.825 --> 41:34.945
and you're mission approved.

41:35.119 --> 41:37.199
No way! Is this really happening?

41:37.371 --> 41:38.461
Yeah.

41:38.706 --> 41:39.746
Whoo-hoo!

41:39.957 --> 41:41.377
A month ago, I had no dads.

41:41.542 --> 41:43.542
Then I had one dad. Now I have two dads!

41:43.711 --> 41:45.841
- And one of them is Batman!
- Yeah.

41:46.005 --> 41:47.335
<i>It's raining dads!</i>

41:47.506 --> 41:48.506
So,

41:48.674 --> 41:50.724
are you ready to follow Batman

41:50.885 --> 41:53.795
and maybe learn a few
life lessons along the way?

41:53.971 --> 41:55.391
I sure am, Dad Two!

41:55.556 --> 41:57.306
But first, where's the seatbelt?

41:57.474 --> 41:59.024
The first lesson is,

41:59.185 --> 42:01.095
life doesn't give you seatbelts!

42:01.270 --> 42:03.270
- Let's go!
- Whoo-hoo!

42:03.522 --> 42:04.772
<i>Yes!</i>

42:06.442 --> 42:08.032
<i>Faster, Dad! Faster!</i>

42:08.986 --> 42:09.986
- Whoo!
- Yeah!

42:10.154 --> 42:11.164
- Whoo!
- Yeah!

42:11.322 --> 42:12.362
Yes, yes, yes!

42:14.116 --> 42:16.616
Oh! Oh, my goodness.
I am so sorry.

42:16.785 --> 42:18.575
Get back up in that seat. There you go.

42:18.746 --> 42:20.746
Hey, listen.
As soon as I get back to the Batcave,

42:20.915 --> 42:23.415
I'll make sure that
Alfred puts seatbelts on there, okay?

42:23.584 --> 42:26.594
But for the time being,
I'm just gonna put my arm right here.

42:26.795 --> 42:29.875
<i>And we're just gonna
gently ease out of here.</i>

42:30.049 --> 42:32.009
<i>And here we go.</i>

42:44.939 --> 42:47.189
Okay. Like all superheroes,

42:47.358 --> 42:49.898
Superman has zero friends,
and he spends most of his time

42:50.069 --> 42:53.949
basking in sweet, sweet isolation,
here at his alone palace.

42:54.240 --> 42:55.620
So, I'll keep him busy

42:55.783 --> 42:58.583
while you sneak into that vent
and get the Projector. Got it?

42:58.744 --> 43:00.584
Copy that! Oh, here's an idea.
I could also...

43:00.746 --> 43:01.890
Whoa, whoa.
Don't even finish that thought.

43:01.914 --> 43:04.834
See this counter?
These are all the good ideas Batman has.

43:05.251 --> 43:07.881
And no one else has ever had
any good ideas. So don't even try.

43:08.045 --> 43:09.625
Your super power...

43:09.838 --> 43:12.508
...is excellent listening
and execution of my ideas.

43:12.675 --> 43:14.425
- Let's try it out.
- Cool!

43:14.593 --> 43:16.433
Drop to the ground. Do a backflip.

43:16.595 --> 43:18.135
Do a front flip. Triple Axel.

43:18.305 --> 43:20.635
Plié. Relevé. Jeté.
Pythagorean theorem.

43:20.808 --> 43:22.160
A squared plus B squared equals C squared.

43:22.184 --> 43:23.194
Physicalize it!

43:23.352 --> 43:25.442
A squared plus B squared

43:25.604 --> 43:27.364
equals C squared.

43:27.606 --> 43:28.750
- How'd I do, Dad?
- Mediocre.

43:28.774 --> 43:29.784
Yes!

43:29.942 --> 43:31.692
And don't call me "Dad."
Now, begin mission.

43:31.860 --> 43:32.860
Yes, Papa.

43:33.028 --> 43:35.278
"Papa" falls into the "Dad" category.

43:53.173 --> 43:54.343
'Sup, Supes?

43:54.508 --> 43:56.968
Wow. It's Batman.

43:57.136 --> 43:59.006
And he's at my house.

43:59.179 --> 44:00.219
Right now.

44:00.431 --> 44:01.771
What are you doing here?

44:01.932 --> 44:04.892
Don't worry about it, dawg.
I'm not here to throw down or anything.

44:05.060 --> 44:06.600
Uh, no, I would crush you.

44:06.854 --> 44:09.364
Okay. Sure, sure, sure.

44:09.523 --> 44:11.323
Hey, listen. Thank me later,

44:11.483 --> 44:13.073
but I just happened to be in the hood.

44:13.235 --> 44:16.065
And I figured that you could
probably use the...

44:18.532 --> 44:20.582
...company.

44:22.494 --> 44:24.254
Wait a minute.

44:24.663 --> 44:26.333
Are you... Are you having

44:26.582 --> 44:30.422
the "57th Annual Justice
League Anniversary Party"

44:30.669 --> 44:32.839
- without me?
- No.

44:33.005 --> 44:34.625
No! No! No!

44:34.798 --> 44:37.548
No! There must have been
some mistake with the email.

44:37.718 --> 44:38.758
That's crazy, man.

44:38.927 --> 44:41.887
Totally! Yes, email mistakes
happen all the time.

44:42.056 --> 44:44.346
Sometimes I don't get
Superman's emails for

44:45.100 --> 44:46.100
years.

44:46.268 --> 44:47.768
Great point, G.L. Great point.

44:47.936 --> 44:49.581
All right.
Well, that clears up everything, right?

44:49.605 --> 44:50.605
Enjoy the party, bro.

44:50.773 --> 44:52.943
Hit it, DJ Wonder Dog.

44:54.860 --> 44:56.450
<i>I'm Superman at the super party</i>

44:56.653 --> 44:58.163
<i>I'm Superman at the super party</i>

44:58.322 --> 44:59.322
<i>Hey-hey</i>

45:00.449 --> 45:02.369
Hey, Batman.
Do you wanna take a quick pic?

45:02.534 --> 45:03.874
Sure. Where do you want me?

45:04.036 --> 45:05.036
Right there is perfect.

45:05.204 --> 45:06.294
- Here's the camera.
- Oh.

45:06.705 --> 45:08.665
Okay, party people, get together.

45:08.832 --> 45:10.132
Yeah. Everybody say...

45:10.292 --> 45:12.132
Super Friends!

45:12.294 --> 45:13.674
Let me see it! Let me see!

45:13.837 --> 45:15.417
Classic! We got everyone.

45:16.048 --> 45:17.508
Yeah, everyone.

45:17.674 --> 45:18.804
Thanks, Batman.

45:18.967 --> 45:21.597
Yeah, no problem. I did, like, a burst.

45:21.804 --> 45:23.764
<i>This party is the bomb!</i>

45:23.931 --> 45:27.311
Look at me! More like
Martian Dance Hunter, am I right?

45:28.977 --> 45:30.267
'Puter, call kid.

45:31.021 --> 45:32.021
Bat-Dad?

45:32.439 --> 45:33.439
How's it going?

45:33.607 --> 45:35.647
'Cause everything is
going great down here.

45:35.818 --> 45:36.818
I can see the target.

45:36.985 --> 45:38.380
<i>But there's some kind of
laser energy thing</i>

45:38.404 --> 45:39.494
<i>that I can't get through.</i>

45:39.655 --> 45:41.445
Okay. I'll see if I can shut it off.

45:41.615 --> 45:43.676
But I'm gonna have to make up
an excuse to leave this party

45:43.700 --> 45:45.200
without anyone noticing.

45:46.662 --> 45:47.702
Bye.

45:49.081 --> 45:50.308
Kid, tell me when it's off, all right?

45:50.332 --> 45:51.332
- Now?
<i>- No.</i>

45:51.500 --> 45:52.540
- Now?
<i>- No.</i>

45:52.709 --> 45:53.749
- Now?
<i>- Not quite.</i>

45:53.919 --> 45:54.919
- Now?
<i>- No.</i>

45:55.087 --> 45:56.167
<i>- My son...
- No.</i>

45:56.338 --> 45:58.316
<i>These irreplaceable crystals
contain all my knowledge,</i>

45:58.340 --> 46:00.260
<i>which I now pass on to...</i>

46:00.426 --> 46:02.506
Darn it. It's gotta be one of these.
Is this the one?

46:03.387 --> 46:05.257
O.M. gosh! You did it, <i>Padre!</i>
It's off!

46:05.431 --> 46:06.431
<i>Okay.</i>

46:06.598 --> 46:08.368
Now you gotta make your way
to the Atomic Cauldron

46:08.392 --> 46:10.062
and get that Phantom Zone Projector.

46:10.227 --> 46:12.187
<i>- Do exactly as I say.</i>
- 10-4!

46:12.354 --> 46:13.524
Okay. Jump!

46:15.274 --> 46:17.114
<i>Do a front flip. Do a backflip.</i>

46:18.444 --> 46:20.574
<i>Run, run, run. Drop.</i>

46:20.737 --> 46:22.107
That's excellent listening.

46:22.281 --> 46:23.281
<i>Shimmy.</i>

46:23.449 --> 46:25.449
<i>Strafe-left. Strafe-right.</i>

46:25.617 --> 46:26.657
<i>Avoid.</i>

46:26.827 --> 46:28.787
Hey, I was thinking.
If I'm gonna be a superhero,

46:28.954 --> 46:32.504
and go on awesome superhero missions
like this one, can we use code names?

46:33.792 --> 46:34.792
Mine can be Robin.

46:34.960 --> 46:36.630
- I'm sorry, say that again?
<i>- Robin!</i>

46:36.795 --> 46:39.375
As in the small, Midwestern frail bird?

46:39.548 --> 46:42.268
<i>Yeah, and I already have a catch phrase.
Tweet, tweet, on the street.</i>

46:42.301 --> 46:43.681
- Hard pass.
<i>- And a song.</i>

46:43.844 --> 46:45.264
<i>Fly, Robin, fly</i>

46:45.429 --> 46:48.019
Harder pass. Now slide!

46:48.182 --> 46:49.392
<i>Okay, kid. I'm gonna teach you</i>

46:49.558 --> 46:51.728
<i>how to masterbuild your way
inside that thing.</i>

46:51.894 --> 46:52.904
Yay!

46:53.061 --> 46:55.191
<i>Grab those 2x6's, pull out the axle studs,</i>

46:55.397 --> 46:56.567
<i>disconnect the 6x10 plates.</i>

46:56.732 --> 46:57.732
Like this?

46:57.941 --> 46:59.781
Whoa! Unbelievable obeying.

46:59.943 --> 47:01.073
<i>Now, let's ride.</i>

47:01.236 --> 47:02.396
<i>Toes to the nose.</i>

47:02.571 --> 47:03.821
<i>Now you're gleaming the cube.</i>

47:03.989 --> 47:05.739
- Yeah!
- Now, get creative.

47:05.908 --> 47:08.158
<i>Freestyle a little bit.
Oh, that's good, kid!</i>

47:08.327 --> 47:10.367
It's like looking in a Bat-mirror.

47:10.537 --> 47:12.367
<i>Okay. Leap.</i>

47:15.167 --> 47:17.037
- I've got the Projector, Dad.
<i>- Booyah!</i>

47:17.211 --> 47:20.091
Now do everything we just did backwards.

47:20.422 --> 47:21.592
Oh.

47:22.758 --> 47:24.678
Oh! Here you go, Dad. We did it!

47:24.843 --> 47:28.063
Yeah! Mission accomplished.
That was fun!

47:30.307 --> 47:33.187
You okay, Batman?
You seem the opposite of stern.

47:34.019 --> 47:35.769
Yeah, I'm fine. It's just

47:35.938 --> 47:38.478
watching you out there,

47:38.649 --> 47:42.109
it was like the world wasn't
all darkness anymore.

47:43.570 --> 47:45.610
<i>For a brief moment</i>

47:45.781 --> 47:48.911
I could have sworn I felt something.

47:49.076 --> 47:51.496
<i>That feeling is pride, sir.</i>

47:52.162 --> 47:53.502
You're right.

47:53.664 --> 47:55.334
I am super proud.

47:57.167 --> 47:58.997
Of myself.

47:59.169 --> 48:02.459
For being such
a good teacher, obviously.

48:02.798 --> 48:04.968
Yeah, you're a great teacher.

48:05.133 --> 48:06.133
I am?

48:06.301 --> 48:09.391
Yeah! I wanna be just like you
when I grow up, <i>Padre!</i>

48:09.555 --> 48:11.215
Wait, what did you call me?

48:12.307 --> 48:13.847
I called you <i>Padre.</i>

48:14.685 --> 48:17.435
It's Spanish for "Dad." Sorry.

48:17.604 --> 48:20.984
Well, isn't it also a cool Spanish way
to say "buddy"?

48:21.149 --> 48:23.029
Yeah, I could've been
saying it that way.

48:23.193 --> 48:24.283
Then I'll allow it.

48:24.444 --> 48:25.784
Oh, you're such a great <i>padre!</i>

48:26.321 --> 48:27.321
What are you doing?

48:27.489 --> 48:29.489
I'm trying to give you a big old hug.

48:29.658 --> 48:30.988
Thought you were attacking me.

48:32.035 --> 48:34.655
<i>Hey, you up for another
top secret superhero mission</i>

48:34.830 --> 48:36.080
<i>to defeat the Joker?</i>

48:36.248 --> 48:38.378
<i>Oh, I am down to stop that clown.</i>

48:38.542 --> 48:40.842
But I don't wanna make
my other dad, Bruce Wayne, angry.

48:41.003 --> 48:42.480
Do you think we'll be done
before my bedtime?

48:42.504 --> 48:43.514
Bedtime?

48:43.672 --> 48:45.172
Batman's life lesson number two.

48:45.340 --> 48:47.180
Vigilantes don't have bedtimes.

48:47.342 --> 48:48.342
Yes!

48:48.510 --> 48:51.560
So, what's the vigilante policy
on cookies?

48:51.847 --> 48:53.677
Unlimited!

48:54.850 --> 48:58.020
<i>All right, kid.
We need to avoid Commissioner Gordon.</i>

48:59.187 --> 49:00.897
<i>So, lesson number three.</i>

49:01.523 --> 49:02.863
When going stealth,

49:03.025 --> 49:06.945
you gotta hide every part of you,
physically and emotionally.

49:07.529 --> 49:08.569
- Got it?
- Yeah!

49:08.739 --> 49:09.739
Already failed.

49:09.906 --> 49:11.576
Now, what I need you to do

49:11.783 --> 49:15.543
is use the naturally dark areas
of your costume,

49:15.704 --> 49:19.294
and integrate into the dark parts
of this environment.

49:19.458 --> 49:20.538
Okay.

49:20.709 --> 49:22.589
- Can you see me?
- Yes.

49:22.753 --> 49:24.593
- How about now?
- Yes.

49:24.755 --> 49:26.625
- What about now? Now?
- Yes.

49:26.798 --> 49:28.548
Yes. You're a goner, kid.

49:28.717 --> 49:30.547
- Batman?
- Barbara!

49:33.096 --> 49:34.966
Batman? Batman!

49:35.641 --> 49:36.891
Hey, there. Look at you.

49:37.059 --> 49:38.519
- Who's this?
- Hi, police lady.

49:38.727 --> 49:40.227
- Is that your son?
- Yes, I am.

49:40.395 --> 49:42.305
Is that my son...
No, that's just weird.

49:42.481 --> 49:43.841
It's weirder if it's not your son.

49:43.982 --> 49:46.232
Right. No, I don't...

49:46.485 --> 49:48.445
I'm not in a relationship or anything.

49:48.612 --> 49:50.242
I could have a kid.

49:50.739 --> 49:52.989
<i>I mean, if I met the right lady,</i>

49:53.158 --> 49:56.158
and if she was just standing
right in front of me,

49:56.328 --> 49:59.408
and we looked at each other and thought,
"Hey, let's do this."

49:59.581 --> 50:01.331
"Let's be together."

50:01.500 --> 50:02.960
- Batman?
- Yes?

50:03.126 --> 50:06.086
I hope you're back because you've decided
to work together

50:06.254 --> 50:07.424
on the Joker case.

50:07.673 --> 50:08.723
Uh...

50:08.924 --> 50:11.184
Yeah. Absolutely!

50:11.385 --> 50:12.385
Great.

50:12.928 --> 50:15.508
Ooh. Arkham Asylum.

50:15.681 --> 50:16.949
- So, before we question the Joker...
- Uh-huh.

50:16.973 --> 50:18.493
...I'm gonna need you to hand
over all your weapons.

50:18.517 --> 50:20.267
I mean, I don't know if I have anything...

50:20.435 --> 50:21.475
Oh!

50:21.770 --> 50:23.110
I just got a couple here. There.

50:23.271 --> 50:24.361
- Is that it?
- Yeah.

50:24.523 --> 50:25.523
Oh. Of course.

50:25.691 --> 50:27.627
What about the utility belt?
Anything in your cape?

50:27.651 --> 50:28.941
Under your cowl?

50:29.111 --> 50:30.321
And your shoes.

50:30.487 --> 50:31.487
There we go.

50:31.655 --> 50:33.365
Uh... This is really uncomfortable.

50:33.532 --> 50:35.452
Sorry. My shoes are part of my pants.

50:36.868 --> 50:37.868
Oops.

50:38.036 --> 50:39.246
- Batman?
- Yes?

50:39.413 --> 50:41.123
Why is your "not son"

50:41.289 --> 50:43.789
trying to smuggle
the Phantom Zone Projector into Arkham?

50:43.959 --> 50:46.499
What? Hey, kid. What is this?

50:46.670 --> 50:48.710
Batman, give me
the Phantom Zone Projector.

50:48.880 --> 50:49.880
- No.
- Batman!

50:50.048 --> 50:51.609
Give me the Phantom Zone Projector!
Give it to me!

50:51.633 --> 50:52.933
No, no, no! Whoa! Nice.

50:53.260 --> 50:55.470
I studied Brazilian jiu-jitsu
at Harvard for Police.

50:55.637 --> 50:58.177
Oh, yeah? Well, guess who got
a PhD in smoke bombs!

50:58.348 --> 50:59.388
Dr. Batman.

50:59.558 --> 51:00.678
Guards! Get them!

51:00.976 --> 51:01.976
Freeze, Batman!

51:02.144 --> 51:05.234
Hey, kid. This is a training exercise.
These guys are my bros.

51:05.397 --> 51:07.125
- Go ahead and take a couple of them out.
- Cool!

51:07.149 --> 51:08.149
Hey, Frank.

51:08.316 --> 51:09.356
You want a piece of Robin?

51:09.484 --> 51:11.034
Barney!
Nice compound fracture!

51:11.194 --> 51:12.954
How'd you like a punch, Glen?

51:13.905 --> 51:14.905
Code Red!

51:15.073 --> 51:16.743
I need total security lockdown, now!

51:19.703 --> 51:20.913
Om!

51:22.456 --> 51:23.706
'Sup, Joker?

51:23.874 --> 51:25.254
Namaste, Batman.

51:25.417 --> 51:26.877
- Namaste.
- Gross.

51:27.043 --> 51:28.503
Ooh. Briefs man. Me, too.

51:28.670 --> 51:30.800
Cut the baloney.
Kid, guard the door, will ya?

51:30.964 --> 51:32.094
On it! Take that, Alan!

51:32.382 --> 51:35.682
Huh. Looks like you're going to
a lot of trouble for little old me.

51:35.844 --> 51:38.014
I must be your greatest enemy after all.

51:38.180 --> 51:39.510
Right, Batman?

51:39.848 --> 51:41.928
- I see what you're trying to do.
- And what is that?

51:42.058 --> 51:44.978
You're trying to entrap me
into a relationship.

51:45.145 --> 51:47.305
- Really?
- Yeah, and it's not gonna work.

51:47.481 --> 51:48.691
Oh, yes, it is.

51:48.857 --> 51:50.857
Because I'm inside your head.

51:51.234 --> 51:52.594
- No, you're not!
- No, you're not!

51:52.694 --> 51:53.704
I knew you'd say that.

51:53.862 --> 51:55.282
- No, you didn't!
- No, you didn't!

51:55.447 --> 51:57.117
And I knew you'd say that!

51:57.282 --> 51:59.412
See? We aren't so different, I and you.

51:59.576 --> 52:01.176
- It's, "you and I!"
- It's, "you and I!"

52:01.495 --> 52:03.905
- Argh!
- Admit it. I'm your greatest enemy.

52:04.080 --> 52:05.520
You're not my greatest enemy, Joker.

52:05.582 --> 52:07.882
Okay, then send me to the Phantom Zone.

52:08.043 --> 52:09.043
Fine, I will.

52:09.211 --> 52:11.711
And prove I'm your greatest enemy.

52:13.131 --> 52:14.551
Batman, don't do this.

52:14.716 --> 52:18.176
As long as you're in the Phantom Zone,
I'll be saving Gotham City,

52:18.345 --> 52:20.005
and that's all that matters to me.

52:20.180 --> 52:21.520
Goodbye, Joker.

52:21.681 --> 52:23.601
Oh, Batman, thank you!

52:26.019 --> 52:29.399
Yes! That's what I call
saving the city again!

52:29.564 --> 52:31.274
Batman, what are you doing?

52:31.441 --> 52:32.691
I'm Batman-ing.

52:34.069 --> 52:35.989
<i>I'm Batman
I'm awesome</i>

52:36.154 --> 52:37.164
<i>I got a nine-pack</i>

52:37.322 --> 52:38.322
<i>Stop it!</i>

52:38.740 --> 52:40.240
Batman, I can't believe you did this.

52:40.408 --> 52:41.408
Hi, police lady.

52:41.576 --> 52:42.736
And even worse,

52:42.911 --> 52:45.251
you've made this kid
into an accessory to your crime.

52:46.414 --> 52:47.464
Sorry, kid.

52:47.624 --> 52:48.634
That's okay, ma'am.

52:48.792 --> 52:50.853
As long as I'm doing a dime
in the big house with my old man,

52:50.877 --> 52:52.167
everything's gonna be A-okay.

52:52.337 --> 52:54.417
Officers, take this Projector
to the evidence room.

52:54.589 --> 52:56.309
- You got it.
- And get this man some pants.

52:56.424 --> 52:57.474
I'm good the way I am.

52:57.634 --> 53:00.354
B Go, why has nobody fist bumped me yet?

53:00.804 --> 53:04.774
You know, when I was a kid,

53:05.433 --> 53:07.893
I wanted to be you, Batman.

53:08.436 --> 53:10.436
I wanted to be as strong

53:10.605 --> 53:13.275
and as fast and as smart as Batman.

53:14.276 --> 53:16.276
But you're not who I thought you were.

53:16.778 --> 53:18.068
Uh... What do you mean?

53:19.114 --> 53:22.454
You can't be a hero
if you only care about yourself.

53:23.285 --> 53:25.285
Barbara, I...

53:27.497 --> 53:28.747
I think you're underestimating

53:28.915 --> 53:31.455
the importance of the Joker
being in the Phantom Zone.

53:32.127 --> 53:34.457
Really, it's kind of a stroke
of genius. All the...

53:34.629 --> 53:35.629
Hey, where are you going?

53:35.797 --> 53:39.297
I just put Joker in the one place
he can't do anyone any harm.

53:40.635 --> 53:41.635
Yeah.

53:42.470 --> 53:46.680
But what if you just gave Joker
exactly what he wanted?

54:11.791 --> 54:12.831
Oh!

54:15.837 --> 54:16.837
Whoa!

54:17.005 --> 54:19.415
Look at this place!
Am I being too loud?

54:20.842 --> 54:22.432
<i>- Hi!</i>
- Oh, my gosh!

54:22.677 --> 54:24.347
<i>Sorry. I always do that.</i>

54:24.512 --> 54:25.656
How about a warning next time?

54:25.680 --> 54:27.080
<i>You're so right, and I am so wrong.</i>

54:27.182 --> 54:29.022
<i>Welcome to the Phantom Zone, bad guy.</i>

54:29.184 --> 54:30.194
Yeah, bad guy.

54:30.352 --> 54:32.371
<i>- My name is Phyllis.</i>
- Oh, that was my grandma's name.

54:32.395 --> 54:34.975
<i>Now hold still while I scan you.</i>

54:35.190 --> 54:36.860
<i>Scanning for badness.</i>

54:37.025 --> 54:38.565
<i>Trying to assess whether you are bad.</i>

54:43.531 --> 54:45.241
<i>Ugh! Your whole thing screams "bad guy."</i>

54:45.575 --> 54:47.695
Oh, yeah. I'm a really bad person.

54:47.869 --> 54:49.619
<i>But with vulnerabilities.</i>

54:49.788 --> 54:51.828
Who, me? No way.

54:51.998 --> 54:54.788
So, where do you keep
all the other bad people in this place?

54:55.210 --> 54:56.750
<i>They're standing right behind you.</i>

54:56.962 --> 54:58.252
Whoa!

54:59.255 --> 55:00.295
Hi there, guys.

55:00.465 --> 55:01.825
Lovely to meet you all. I'm the...

55:01.967 --> 55:03.797
Oh, fist bump?
There we... Handshake?

55:04.511 --> 55:06.051
It doesn't matter.
I'm the Joker.

55:06.221 --> 55:07.601
Take a look at the new guy.

55:07.764 --> 55:10.064
Guess they'll just let anybody in here.

55:10.225 --> 55:11.595
Oh, no, no, no. I'm very bad, too.

55:11.768 --> 55:13.978
They just showed a video montage...

55:14.145 --> 55:15.555
- Boring!
- What?

55:15.730 --> 55:17.320
- You're boring.
- He looks delicious.

55:17.524 --> 55:18.734
Let's eat this guy.

55:20.318 --> 55:22.608
Stop with the violence for just a second!

55:22.779 --> 55:26.069
What if I told you
I could get you outta here?

55:27.575 --> 55:28.719
I'm sorry, what'd you just say?

55:28.743 --> 55:30.253
That's right. I'm so bad,

55:30.453 --> 55:33.583
I got myself thrown into
this heck-hole on purpose!

55:33.748 --> 55:34.788
I'm listening.

55:34.958 --> 55:37.038
Count me interested.

55:37.210 --> 55:38.920
Look, everyone here knows

55:39.087 --> 55:41.417
what it's like to be hurt
by a hero, don't they?

55:41.589 --> 55:43.549
We've all been taken for granted, right?

55:43.717 --> 55:45.387
- Yeah, bro.
- I'm relating.

55:45.552 --> 55:49.262
Well, that's why I came
to this space prison.

55:49.431 --> 55:50.911
To recruit the universe's greatest...

55:51.057 --> 55:53.137
- We'll do it!
- I'm sorry?

55:53.309 --> 55:54.745
You were going to
say something about

55:54.769 --> 55:56.729
recruiting the universe's
greatest villains

55:56.896 --> 55:59.266
to conquer a superhero.

55:59.441 --> 56:01.031
- Am I right?
- Uh, yeah.

56:01.192 --> 56:03.032
- Well, we're in!
- Yay!

56:03.278 --> 56:04.630
Really? Because I brought a PowerPoint...

56:04.654 --> 56:05.744
Still boring!

56:05.905 --> 56:07.155
Yeah. Just get on with it.

56:07.323 --> 56:08.783
You want us to humiliate him?

56:08.950 --> 56:09.990
I certainly do. Yes.

56:10.160 --> 56:12.700
You want us to make him
grovel at your feet?

56:12.871 --> 56:14.751
I would like to see that very much!

56:14.914 --> 56:17.084
You want us to smite him?

56:17.250 --> 56:18.460
Well, yeah, yeah, yeah.

56:18.626 --> 56:20.386
You want us to make
the rivers of Gotham City

56:20.503 --> 56:22.133
run red with his blood?

56:22.297 --> 56:23.417
Oh, that's...

56:23.590 --> 56:25.970
Oh, no blood?
How do you feel about lava?

56:26.134 --> 56:27.144
Yes! Lava.

56:27.302 --> 56:28.302
- Done.
- Yay!

56:28.511 --> 56:29.751
I can't wait
to crush buildings.

56:29.804 --> 56:30.814
Excuse me. Hello?

56:30.972 --> 56:32.642
Over here.
I don't want to be a downer,

56:32.807 --> 56:34.887
but how exactly are we going
to get outta this place?

56:35.060 --> 56:37.980
Oh, leave that to me.

56:38.563 --> 56:39.813
Don't wanna jinx us,

56:39.981 --> 56:42.321
but I'll be a lot happier when
this Phantom Zone Projector

56:42.525 --> 56:43.985
is locked up tight.

56:45.487 --> 56:46.697
Going up, ma'am?

56:46.863 --> 56:49.993
No. You're going down!

56:50.658 --> 56:52.408
Look out! Smash!

56:53.495 --> 56:55.655
I guess you're right.
I am going up. Ding!

56:58.166 --> 57:00.166
Here comes the...

57:00.335 --> 57:02.835
Phantom Zone!

57:05.840 --> 57:06.880
Huh?

57:08.676 --> 57:10.006
I'm gonna go start looting.

57:10.178 --> 57:13.468
Hello, Gotham City!

57:13.640 --> 57:16.140
The Clown Prince of Crime

57:16.434 --> 57:17.944
<i>is back!</i>

57:18.103 --> 57:20.523
Commissioner Gordon,
you gotta take a look at this.

57:20.772 --> 57:21.772
<i>What's that?</i>

57:21.940 --> 57:23.820
A monkey
and dog are friends.

57:23.983 --> 57:25.323
Not that. That!

57:25.485 --> 57:28.525
<i>And I've come
to finally take over the city.</i>

57:28.696 --> 57:30.656
<i>But in order to do that,</i>

57:30.824 --> 57:34.704
<i>I need to break my friends
out of a giant, scary prison.</i>

57:34.869 --> 57:37.159
- Hey, guys, he means us!
- Yay!

57:37.372 --> 57:38.542
<i>And I ain't talking about</i>

57:38.706 --> 57:41.376
<i>those rogue losers dressed in cosplay!</i>

57:41.668 --> 57:43.418
- Oh!
- Me-ouch.

57:43.586 --> 57:45.796
I'm talking about my new peeps!

57:45.964 --> 57:47.424
And they're just like me.

57:47.715 --> 57:50.255
The greatest villains you'll ever see.

57:50.426 --> 57:51.966
You wanna meet them?

57:52.220 --> 57:53.890
- No.
- Too bad.

57:55.181 --> 57:56.601
<i>He's evil, he's magic,</i>

57:56.766 --> 57:59.556
<i>and it's about to get tragic.</i>

57:59.727 --> 58:01.397
<i>It's Voldemort.</i>

58:01.563 --> 58:02.813
Magic!

58:04.399 --> 58:05.779
You are a fish.

58:05.942 --> 58:06.942
You are a frog.

58:07.110 --> 58:08.110
You are a fish frog.

58:08.278 --> 58:10.858
<i>He's a 9,000-year-old
incarnation of evil,</i>

58:11.030 --> 58:12.660
<i>with an eye forjewelry.</i>

58:12.824 --> 58:14.414
<i>Give it up for Sauron!</i>

58:14.576 --> 58:16.576
Good afternoon, Gotham City.

58:21.207 --> 58:24.087
<i>He likes long, violent walks
on historic buildings.</i>

58:24.252 --> 58:25.672
<i>It's King Kong!</i>

58:25.837 --> 58:27.047
Come at me, Gotham!

58:29.007 --> 58:32.217
Commissioner Gordon, these monsters,
they're too powerful.

58:32.927 --> 58:34.297
Can you contain them to downtown?

58:34.929 --> 58:36.219
That's gonna be impossible.

58:36.389 --> 58:38.099
Half the police force are fish!

58:38.266 --> 58:40.766
Sergeant Jackson!
Stop floppin' around!

58:40.935 --> 58:42.935
<i>And rounding out
the evil all-stars,</i>

58:43.104 --> 58:44.314
<i>Wicked Witch!</i>

58:44.480 --> 58:45.770
<i>Medusa.</i>

58:45.940 --> 58:47.280
<i>And British robots!</i>

58:47.442 --> 58:48.572
Exterminate!

58:48.735 --> 58:50.065
<i>Ask your nerd friends.</i>

58:50.612 --> 58:52.992
<i>Hello? Bad guys?</i>

58:56.951 --> 59:00.081
What a crew, huh?
And they all work for me!

59:00.246 --> 59:03.956
Who's the greatest villain
of them all now, Batman?

59:04.125 --> 59:05.285
Still not you.

59:05.460 --> 59:07.500
Actually, this does look
pretty terrifying, Bat-Dad.

59:07.629 --> 59:08.629
Whee!

59:08.796 --> 59:10.296
Nice destruction all around.

59:10.465 --> 59:11.465
<i>Watch your step!</i>

59:11.633 --> 59:13.133
<i>Good work, guys!</i>

59:13.301 --> 59:15.261
Now, all that's left for me

59:15.428 --> 59:18.308
is to rub it in Batman's bat face.

59:18.473 --> 59:20.933
Hey, Sauron, doesn't your flaming eye

59:21.100 --> 59:23.770
have a unique ability
to peer through time and space?

59:23.978 --> 59:26.148
- Uh-huh.
- Well, I need to find Batman.

59:26.314 --> 59:27.864
Where's homeboy's man cave?

59:28.066 --> 59:29.816
Hmm. Give me a second.

59:29.984 --> 59:31.114
Scary noise.

59:31.277 --> 59:32.897
It's beneath Wayne Manor!

59:33.112 --> 59:34.256
Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

59:34.280 --> 59:35.280
Hold on a sec.

59:35.448 --> 59:37.118
Are you trying to tell me

59:37.283 --> 59:39.953
that Bruce Wayne is Batman...

59:40.787 --> 59:41.997
...'s roommate?

59:42.497 --> 59:44.247
Uh... Yeah.

59:44.958 --> 59:47.878
Evil army, this way to the Batcave!

59:52.340 --> 59:53.340
Good grief!

01:00:06.062 --> 01:00:07.402
Hey, Batman!

01:00:07.563 --> 01:00:09.403
Joker's home.

01:00:10.692 --> 01:00:13.572
I'm rubbing my butt
all over your stuff.

01:00:13.736 --> 01:00:15.856
We're going to have to rename this
the Butt-mobile.

01:00:17.949 --> 01:00:19.079
Hey, evil army.

01:00:19.242 --> 01:00:20.662
I need Batman brought here.

01:00:20.827 --> 01:00:22.157
Now go get him!

01:00:22.328 --> 01:00:23.498
Joker out!

01:00:26.833 --> 01:00:27.833
Uh...

01:00:28.001 --> 01:00:29.091
<i>Padre?</i>

01:00:29.252 --> 01:00:30.252
<i>Yeah?</i>

01:00:30.420 --> 01:00:31.840
Do you ever get scared?

01:00:32.547 --> 01:00:33.587
No.

01:00:34.507 --> 01:00:37.717
Yeah, that's what I figured,
'cause you're Batman.

01:00:44.142 --> 01:00:47.562
Hey, kid.
You know who does get scared?

01:00:47.729 --> 01:00:48.729
<i>Who?</i>

01:00:48.938 --> 01:00:50.268
Bruce Wayne.

01:00:50.440 --> 01:00:52.230
<i>- Really?</i>
- Yeah.

01:00:52.400 --> 01:00:54.070
Bruno told me once

01:00:54.235 --> 01:00:57.445
that sometimes the only way
to get out of a down moment

01:00:57.613 --> 01:00:59.243
is to start boxing.

01:00:59.741 --> 01:01:01.701
And by "boxing," he meant

01:01:01.868 --> 01:01:03.238
beatboxing.

01:01:03.411 --> 01:01:04.621
Oh!

01:01:04.787 --> 01:01:06.867
<i>Na, Na, Na, Na, Na, Na, Na...</i>

01:01:09.208 --> 01:01:10.918
<i>Feel it, uh-huh</i>

01:01:11.085 --> 01:01:12.955
<i>Dick Grayson on the mic, go</i>

01:01:13.129 --> 01:01:14.129
Oh. Um...

01:01:19.927 --> 01:01:22.057
Oh, my gosh.
This does make me feel better.

01:01:22.221 --> 01:01:23.261
Okay. Shh. Batman solo.

01:01:23.431 --> 01:01:25.601
<i>Bat, bat, bat
Can I get a bat?</i>

01:01:25.767 --> 01:01:27.097
<i>Can I get a bat?
Bat...</i>

01:01:27.268 --> 01:01:28.268
The Bat-Fax!

01:01:30.355 --> 01:01:32.185
Ha! The city needs me.
Bang, bang, bang!

01:01:32.357 --> 01:01:33.397
Excuse me.

01:01:33.566 --> 01:01:35.896
Can you get the commissioner
and show her this?

01:01:36.069 --> 01:01:38.279
- Batman.
- Would you stop doing that?

01:01:38.780 --> 01:01:40.660
I sent the Bat-Fax.

01:01:41.157 --> 01:01:43.327
I hate to say this,
but you're right.

01:01:43.493 --> 01:01:44.493
The city needs you.

01:01:44.660 --> 01:01:45.790
Yes! Let me out.

01:01:45.953 --> 01:01:48.793
I'm only going to let you out
on one condition.

01:01:48.956 --> 01:01:51.666
- Name it.
- You can't do it by yourself.

01:01:54.420 --> 01:01:55.800
Fine. Who am I working with?

01:01:55.963 --> 01:01:58.423
SEAL Team Six? Fox Force Five?
Suicide Squad?

01:01:58.591 --> 01:02:00.681
No. Me.

01:02:00.843 --> 01:02:01.843
Oh, I wanna help, too!

01:02:02.011 --> 01:02:03.371
- And I shall join as well.
- Whoa!

01:02:03.513 --> 01:02:05.313
Alfred Pennyworth
at your service, ma'am.

01:02:05.473 --> 01:02:07.201
- How did you...
- Alfred, you gotta let me out of here.

01:02:07.225 --> 01:02:10.305
Sir, those creatures out there
are unlike anything we've ever seen.

01:02:10.478 --> 01:02:12.498
Speak for yourself.
You don't know everything I've seen.

01:02:12.522 --> 01:02:13.722
I haven't told you everything.

01:02:13.815 --> 01:02:16.315
And you'll never be able
to defeat them alone.

01:02:16.484 --> 01:02:18.654
And it'll be more fun
if we all do it together!

01:02:18.820 --> 01:02:20.490
What's the worst thing
that could happen?

01:02:20.905 --> 01:02:22.485
What are you so afraid of?

01:02:22.657 --> 01:02:24.487
The thing I'm most afraid of?

01:02:29.831 --> 01:02:31.791
I gotta be honest with you.
It's snake clowns.

01:02:31.958 --> 01:02:33.168
Yeah, that's not a thing.

01:02:33.334 --> 01:02:34.754
Well then, nothing.

01:02:34.961 --> 01:02:37.171
- I'm not afraid of anything.
- Okay.

01:02:37.922 --> 01:02:39.172
Prove it.

01:02:39.507 --> 01:02:41.007
- Oh, I will.
- Good.

01:02:41.175 --> 01:02:43.465
Do you know what the B-A-T
in Batman stands for?

01:02:43.636 --> 01:02:45.806
- Not really.
- Best At Teamwork.

01:02:45.972 --> 01:02:48.352
Best At Teamwork Man
is my full name.

01:02:48.516 --> 01:02:50.346
Yay! We're going on a family trip.

01:02:50.518 --> 01:02:52.058
This is not a family trip.

01:02:52.228 --> 01:02:53.398
I can wear my costume, too.

01:02:53.563 --> 01:02:55.833
Well, luckily for us,
you left your costume back at the...

01:02:55.857 --> 01:02:57.067
- Rip!
- Oh!

01:02:57.233 --> 01:02:59.403
Nope. Under your clothes.
That's perfect.

01:02:59.569 --> 01:03:01.989
- Rip!
- Alfred, what are you doing?

01:03:02.155 --> 01:03:03.155
I miss the '60s.

01:03:03.322 --> 01:03:04.532
Hey, can Scarecrow help?

01:03:04.699 --> 01:03:06.259
- Yeah!
- He's destroying our city, too!

01:03:06.367 --> 01:03:08.577
Permit us to lend you assistance.

01:03:08.744 --> 01:03:10.254
Yeah. Why don't we use these guys?

01:03:10.413 --> 01:03:11.413
What am I gonna do?

01:03:11.581 --> 01:03:13.517
Get a bunch of criminals together
to fight the criminals?

01:03:13.541 --> 01:03:14.961
That's a stupid idea.

01:03:18.754 --> 01:03:20.554
Okay, guys. Game plan.

01:03:20.715 --> 01:03:21.795
Joker's taken the Projector

01:03:21.883 --> 01:03:23.026
- to Wayne Manor.
- Wayne Manor.

01:03:23.050 --> 01:03:24.390
Right. Thanks, Batman.

01:03:24.552 --> 01:03:25.696
- We need that Projector.
- Projector.

01:03:25.720 --> 01:03:26.720
Or there's no way

01:03:26.888 --> 01:03:28.031
- to blast these monsters...
- Monsters.

01:03:28.055 --> 01:03:29.533
- ...back to the Phantom Zone.
- Phantom Zone? Yep.

01:03:29.557 --> 01:03:31.201
Batman, I really don't
need you to finish my...

01:03:31.225 --> 01:03:32.265
- Sand castles.
- No.

01:03:32.435 --> 01:03:33.555
- Sister's homework.
- No.

01:03:33.728 --> 01:03:35.398
- Succulent something.
- No.

01:03:35.897 --> 01:03:36.937
Um... Everybody?

01:03:37.106 --> 01:03:39.896
Batman is in Arkham Asylum.

01:03:40.067 --> 01:03:41.737
Get him!

01:03:41.903 --> 01:03:43.103
Okay, everyone, grab on to me.

01:03:43.905 --> 01:03:45.275
Whoa!

01:03:49.494 --> 01:03:50.754
We've gotta take cover!

01:03:50.953 --> 01:03:51.953
Whoa!

01:03:52.330 --> 01:03:54.750
- Joker has eyes on us.
- Where?

01:03:54.916 --> 01:03:58.376
No! I mean,
he literally has a giant eye on us.

01:03:58.544 --> 01:04:00.254
<i>I think that thing
can see our every move!</i>

01:04:00.421 --> 01:04:01.591
Shaka-laka-Iako.

01:04:01.797 --> 01:04:05.217
We've got to destroy it,
or we'll never make it to Wayne Manor.

01:04:05.384 --> 01:04:06.434
Uh... Bat-Dad?

01:04:06.636 --> 01:04:08.036
I really think you should see this.

01:04:08.179 --> 01:04:09.639
Building survey!

01:04:10.431 --> 01:04:12.101
This building's not up to code!

01:04:18.940 --> 01:04:20.780
Gotcha.

01:04:24.070 --> 01:04:25.240
Is that real lava?

01:04:26.948 --> 01:04:27.948
I'm okay.

01:04:30.076 --> 01:04:31.446
All right, yeah. It's 100% lava.

01:04:33.454 --> 01:04:35.641
- Everyone, start throwing me bricks.
- Right away, sir.

01:04:35.665 --> 01:04:37.309
<i>- I need a 4x6. Come on, quick.</i>
- Here you go.

01:04:37.333 --> 01:04:38.383
<i>- I need an elbow.</i>
- Elbow.

01:04:45.299 --> 01:04:46.299
Ow!

01:04:51.430 --> 01:04:52.430
<i>Whoo!</i>

01:04:52.598 --> 01:04:54.848
<i>Yes! I did it. Pretty cool, huh?</i>

01:04:55.017 --> 01:04:56.517
<i>- Batman?
- Yeah?</i>

01:04:56.686 --> 01:04:59.106
Why did you build this thing
with only one seat?

01:04:59.272 --> 01:05:02.282
'Cause last I checked,
I only had one butt. What the...

01:05:03.109 --> 01:05:04.939
<i>What have you done to Wayne Manor?</i>

01:05:05.778 --> 01:05:07.528
<i>Hey, Batman, guess what!</i>

01:05:07.780 --> 01:05:09.370
I found out one of your secrets.

01:05:09.657 --> 01:05:12.157
- Uh-oh.
- What do we have here, Batman?

01:05:12.326 --> 01:05:14.406
It looks like a bunch
of relationship comedies.

01:05:14.579 --> 01:05:16.289
- What's that one?
<i>- Must Love Dogs.</i>

01:05:16.455 --> 01:05:17.495
Must love crying.

01:05:17.665 --> 01:05:19.625
<i>- Marley & Me.</i>
- I love the ending.

01:05:19.792 --> 01:05:22.462
Oh! <i>Serendipity?</i>

01:05:22.628 --> 01:05:24.298
We have <i>Serendipity?</i>
I love that movie!

01:05:24.463 --> 01:05:26.223
<i>For a loner, Batman,</i>

01:05:26.382 --> 01:05:29.682
<i>you sure like movies
about relationships!</i>

01:05:29.844 --> 01:05:31.084
Oh! And look what else I found!

01:05:31.512 --> 01:05:33.512
<i>All your wonderful toys.</i>

01:05:35.975 --> 01:05:39.725
<i>Accio</i> lightning storm!

01:05:40.688 --> 01:05:43.478
Uh... Everyone, hold on.

01:05:48.613 --> 01:05:51.663
<i>Gremlins,
dismantle that plane now!</i>

01:05:52.867 --> 01:05:54.287
Ugly monsters on our three.

01:05:55.995 --> 01:05:57.705
- Uh <i>... Padre?</i>
- Not now, kid.

01:05:59.582 --> 01:06:01.132
<i>Kind of got my hands full.</i>

01:06:02.960 --> 01:06:04.960
I've got good tone. Firing.

01:06:08.924 --> 01:06:10.724
- Uh... Batman?
- What's up, buddy?

01:06:11.177 --> 01:06:12.507
<i>Are we nearly at Wayne Manor?</i>

01:06:12.678 --> 01:06:13.848
<i>Why?</i>

01:06:14.263 --> 01:06:16.143
Uh... Your number two
needs to go number one.

01:06:16.307 --> 01:06:18.477
I thought I told you
to go back at the prison.

01:06:18.643 --> 01:06:20.393
- I tried, but Bane was in there.
- So?

01:06:20.561 --> 01:06:22.861
He had sort of a "get out
of this bathroom now" vibe.

01:06:23.022 --> 01:06:25.522
<i>I knew I shouldn't
have given you that water.</i>

01:06:27.276 --> 01:06:28.986
Can you hold it in like a big boy?

01:06:29.445 --> 01:06:30.655
Engine one down.

01:06:30.821 --> 01:06:32.382
Not a big deal.
Don't worry about it. It's fine.

01:06:32.406 --> 01:06:34.326
- Engine two down.
- It does that sometimes.

01:06:34.909 --> 01:06:36.039
<i>We've lost engine three.</i>

01:06:36.202 --> 01:06:37.452
Oh. Could live without it.

01:06:39.246 --> 01:06:40.706
<i>Engine four!</i>

01:06:42.458 --> 01:06:43.748
That I do need to fix.

01:06:43.918 --> 01:06:45.998
Good news.
Our bathroom problem is solved.

01:06:48.589 --> 01:06:50.389
<i>You three wait here
while I go fix the engine.</i>

01:06:50.424 --> 01:06:53.184
Don't worry, Batman.
You fix the Batwing, I'll fly.

01:06:53.344 --> 01:06:54.988
All good, Babs.
I've got my autopilot on it.

01:06:55.012 --> 01:06:56.012
Done.

01:06:56.347 --> 01:06:58.137
<i>Autopilot?
That's just a rope!</i>

01:06:58.307 --> 01:07:01.597
Exactly. All right, guys.
Until I get back, rope's in charge.

01:07:02.353 --> 01:07:03.403
Thanks, rope.

01:07:05.981 --> 01:07:08.781
All right, let's see.
Yes, the piston brake out here.

01:07:08.943 --> 01:07:11.453
Jet engine brake in here and...

01:07:12.613 --> 01:07:14.703
Get out of here. No.
Give me... No! Stop it!

01:07:14.865 --> 01:07:16.505
Come on, Master Dick.
We need to help him.

01:07:16.575 --> 01:07:17.615
I'm with you, Grandpa!

01:07:17.785 --> 01:07:18.905
Get off my <i>Padre!</i>

01:07:19.078 --> 01:07:20.958
Unhand him,
you animatronic fiends.

01:07:21.122 --> 01:07:24.252
What are you two doing here?
I told you to stay in the cockpit.

01:07:25.126 --> 01:07:27.036
You disobeyed me.
You're on a timeout.

01:07:27.211 --> 01:07:28.841
Batman, you're on a timeout.

01:07:29.004 --> 01:07:31.264
What? Alfred, you better
un-timeout me right now!

01:07:31.424 --> 01:07:33.684
No. Not until you un-timeout Master Dick.

01:07:35.094 --> 01:07:36.764
Guys, you're all un-timeouted!

01:07:36.929 --> 01:07:37.929
We have incoming!

01:07:38.097 --> 01:07:40.097
- Sir! Watch out for those...
- What are you doing?

01:07:46.188 --> 01:07:47.728
Okay. Everybody, timeout off.

01:07:47.940 --> 01:07:49.480
Whoo-hoo! I've been parented.

01:07:49.650 --> 01:07:51.780
- Batman, I can help you.
- No. Protect the rope.

01:07:51.944 --> 01:07:53.364
The rope is fine!

01:07:53.529 --> 01:07:54.609
Save Master Dick!

01:07:54.780 --> 01:07:57.410
I'm fine. I'll just do
one of my gymnastics moves to...

01:07:59.034 --> 01:08:00.124
No!

01:08:05.833 --> 01:08:06.883
Dick...

01:08:10.588 --> 01:08:11.758
Gotcha!

01:08:15.426 --> 01:08:17.336
Hold on, Alfred. I'm almost there!

01:08:18.929 --> 01:08:20.179
No!

01:08:22.767 --> 01:08:24.636
Alfred!

01:08:33.527 --> 01:08:34.697
No.

01:08:39.366 --> 01:08:40.866
No!

01:08:42.077 --> 01:08:43.197
Move over, rope.

01:08:45.372 --> 01:08:46.542
<i>Hold on!</i>

01:09:00.220 --> 01:09:01.720
Gotcha!

01:09:02.680 --> 01:09:03.810
Barbara, did you see that?

01:09:03.974 --> 01:09:05.394
Batrope saved Alfred.

01:09:05.559 --> 01:09:08.229
Sick moves, rope.
I never doubted you, bro.

01:09:08.395 --> 01:09:10.395
<i>Actually, sir,
Ms. Gordon saved him.</i>

01:09:10.564 --> 01:09:11.823
Rope! You lied to me!

01:09:12.817 --> 01:09:15.357
Wait a minute.
You mean, without you,

01:09:15.528 --> 01:09:16.738
Alfred would have been

01:09:17.571 --> 01:09:18.911
<i>street meat?</i>

01:09:19.073 --> 01:09:21.582
Batman, trust us.

01:09:21.742 --> 01:09:23.582
We can do this.

01:09:23.743 --> 01:09:26.663
- Yeah. I know Gymkata.
- Sorry, what's that?

01:09:26.831 --> 01:09:28.461
It's a gymnastics-based martial art.

01:09:28.749 --> 01:09:30.919
I can punch those '80s monsters
off the plane.

01:09:31.085 --> 01:09:32.335
Uh... Okay.

01:09:32.837 --> 01:09:34.796
<i>Multiple bogeys on our six.</i>

01:09:34.964 --> 01:09:36.243
Sir, I'll get them off our back.

01:09:36.381 --> 01:09:38.102
I was a tail gunner
for the Royal Air Force.

01:09:38.175 --> 01:09:39.425
Locked and loaded, sir!

01:09:39.593 --> 01:09:40.643
Good. Love that!

01:09:40.803 --> 01:09:42.603
I got an idea.
We're gonna change course.

01:09:42.763 --> 01:09:44.933
<i>I want you to fly straight
into that flaming eyeball.</i>

01:09:45.099 --> 01:09:47.849
- What?
- Barbara, trust me.

01:09:48.602 --> 01:09:50.732
All right. Let's do this.

01:09:58.070 --> 01:09:59.700
We got a giant
sea monster, 12 o'clock!

01:09:59.864 --> 01:10:00.874
Got it.

01:10:02.408 --> 01:10:04.368
- We've got his attention.
- He's tracking us.

01:10:09.415 --> 01:10:10.995
I've got you now.

01:10:15.629 --> 01:10:17.339
Eat dirt!

01:10:17.506 --> 01:10:19.586
Bob's your uncle, you ruddy duff cobblers!

01:10:26.056 --> 01:10:27.306
Okay, Babs, this is it.

01:10:27.474 --> 01:10:29.694
Fly us straight into that eye,
and wait for my signal.

01:10:29.852 --> 01:10:30.982
Can it come now?

01:10:31.145 --> 01:10:32.645
Can we make the signal thing happen?

01:10:32.813 --> 01:10:33.813
Almost there.

01:10:33.981 --> 01:10:35.861
<i>Almost there!</i>

01:10:36.025 --> 01:10:38.145
- Fire!
<i>- Almost there!</i>

01:10:38.319 --> 01:10:39.449
That fire's coming in hot!

01:10:39.612 --> 01:10:40.652
Hot, hot, hot!

01:10:41.113 --> 01:10:42.323
Now! Barbara, dive bomb!

01:10:45.659 --> 01:10:47.449
My eye!

01:10:49.663 --> 01:10:51.503
Sauron!

01:10:57.129 --> 01:10:58.589
Nothing to see.

01:11:05.262 --> 01:11:06.312
Whoo-hoo!

01:11:06.513 --> 01:11:08.723
- Yes! That was so rad!
- We did it, everyone!

01:11:08.891 --> 01:11:10.021
That was so great! Go team!

01:11:10.184 --> 01:11:11.384
Come on, let's hear it for us!

01:11:11.477 --> 01:11:12.687
That was incredible!

01:11:12.853 --> 01:11:13.853
I felt so jazzed!

01:11:14.021 --> 01:11:15.191
I say "jazzed"!

01:11:15.356 --> 01:11:17.436
I gotta give it to you, Batman.
That was awesome.

01:11:17.608 --> 01:11:19.048
- Ha! And you were awesome.
- Thanks.

01:11:19.193 --> 01:11:20.503
<i>- And you were awesome.</i>
- I love compliments!

01:11:20.527 --> 01:11:22.237
And you were awesome,
and I was amazing.

01:11:22.404 --> 01:11:24.341
I'm not trying to make it
about myself, obviously.

01:11:24.365 --> 01:11:26.885
But I just wanna make sure
that everyone gets a pat on the back.

01:11:27.034 --> 01:11:28.595
- Because it feels good.
- It does feel good.

01:11:28.619 --> 01:11:30.180
<i>You had a good idea, you had a good idea,</i>

01:11:30.204 --> 01:11:32.214
and you had a good idea,
and I had a great idea.

01:11:32.373 --> 01:11:34.654
You know what, I think that collectively,
I'm gonna add...

01:11:36.210 --> 01:11:37.540
...one.

01:11:37.753 --> 01:11:38.923
- No way!
- Yes!

01:11:39.088 --> 01:11:40.168
Man, that feels good.

01:11:40.339 --> 01:11:41.839
Best team ever!

01:11:42.007 --> 01:11:44.288
Let's take a photo!
All right, everyone, squeeze together.

01:11:44.385 --> 01:11:45.425
Hang on a second.

01:11:45.594 --> 01:11:47.474
- Nice and close!
- I gotta get my pump on.

01:11:47.638 --> 01:11:48.823
- It's worth it.
- Okay, everybody in?

01:11:48.847 --> 01:11:49.887
These abs are no fluke.

01:11:50.057 --> 01:11:51.637
Everyone say, "Bat Family!"

01:11:51.809 --> 01:11:52.889
Bat Family!

01:11:53.727 --> 01:11:55.147
Ooh, let's take a look!

01:11:56.188 --> 01:11:57.358
<i>Look at that!</i>

01:11:57.523 --> 01:11:58.903
- Splendid.
- Wow.

01:11:59.650 --> 01:12:01.240
Didn't it turn out great?

01:12:02.069 --> 01:12:04.279
Hey, guys! It's my first family photo!

01:12:34.268 --> 01:12:35.598
- Hey, Bat-Dad.
- Oh!

01:12:35.978 --> 01:12:37.598
Whoa. What are you doing?

01:12:37.771 --> 01:12:40.021
I'm trying to give you a big, old H-U-G.

01:12:40.190 --> 01:12:41.570
Okay, just...

01:12:43.068 --> 01:12:44.988
Batman, are you okay?

01:12:45.404 --> 01:12:47.364
Yeah, I'm fine.

01:12:47.531 --> 01:12:49.661
We are just one big happy

01:12:49.825 --> 01:12:53.365
fraternity of people
who did an awesome job together.

01:12:54.788 --> 01:12:56.498
I can't think of any other way
to put that.

01:12:56.665 --> 01:12:58.915
- Cool.
- So, guys, listen up!

01:12:59.084 --> 01:13:00.714
Taking the Projector from the Joker

01:13:00.878 --> 01:13:03.048
is gonna be our most
dangerous mission yet.

01:13:03.213 --> 01:13:04.673
- A family battle mission!
- Right.

01:13:04.840 --> 01:13:07.430
Salvage what you can out of the Scuttler,
and maybe root around,

01:13:07.593 --> 01:13:09.279
see if you can find
a few Vitamin waters or something,

01:13:09.303 --> 01:13:10.303
and then we'll head out.

01:13:10.471 --> 01:13:12.311
- Right away, sir.
- Anything for you, <i>Padre.</i>

01:13:17.394 --> 01:13:19.194
I think I'll need snowshoes.

01:13:19.354 --> 01:13:22.864
Yeah, I don't think you'll need snowshoes,
but could you grab that flashlight?

01:13:23.025 --> 01:13:24.105
- Batman?
<i>- Padre?</i>

01:13:24.276 --> 01:13:25.316
Sir?

01:13:25.486 --> 01:13:27.946
What are you doing?
Hey, Batman.

01:13:28.113 --> 01:13:29.413
Please, wait!

01:13:29.573 --> 01:13:30.783
'Puter.

01:13:32.576 --> 01:13:33.736
<i>Yes, sir?</i>

01:13:33.911 --> 01:13:35.621
I'm locking in some coordinates now.

01:13:37.164 --> 01:13:38.874
Take the Scuttler to the taco stand

01:13:39.041 --> 01:13:40.921
on the border of Gotham City
and Blüdhaven.

01:13:41.085 --> 01:13:42.335
No!

01:13:42.503 --> 01:13:44.564
I want you to get these guys
a couple of chimichangas

01:13:44.588 --> 01:13:46.758
- and three Jarritos.
- Sir!

01:13:46.924 --> 01:13:50.144
And then keep them there until this
whole attack on Gotham City blows over.

01:13:50.302 --> 01:13:53.012
<i>Padre,</i> please. Don't do this!

01:13:53.180 --> 01:13:55.180
Batman, you need us!

01:13:55.516 --> 01:13:57.426
How many times I gotta tell you?

01:13:58.060 --> 01:14:00.270
Batman works alone.

01:14:00.896 --> 01:14:02.516
No, we have to stick together.

01:14:03.899 --> 01:14:05.029
Please.

01:14:05.192 --> 01:14:06.822
Now go on, Scuttler. Go!

01:14:07.861 --> 01:14:09.661
- Go! Just get outta here.
- Batman.

01:14:09.822 --> 01:14:10.912
<i>- Padre!</i>
- Get moving!

01:14:11.073 --> 01:14:12.243
Please!

01:14:12.449 --> 01:14:13.449
Just go.

01:14:13.617 --> 01:14:14.827
Batman! Please, wait!

01:14:14.993 --> 01:14:16.453
Scuttler, move out!

01:14:16.620 --> 01:14:18.120
<i>You're doing the wrong thing!</i>

01:14:18.288 --> 01:14:20.578
<i>- Listen to me! Don't do this!
- Sir, please. Sir!</i>

01:14:20.749 --> 01:14:22.079
<i>No!</i>

01:14:43.939 --> 01:14:46.069
Scanning for intruders.
Scanning for intruders.

01:14:46.233 --> 01:14:47.783
Scanning for intruders.

01:14:51.155 --> 01:14:52.155
Hi, Bats.

01:14:52.322 --> 01:14:53.822
What have you done to my...

01:14:53.991 --> 01:14:55.581
Bruce Wayne's house?

01:14:55.742 --> 01:14:58.502
You'd better hope he's a cool guy
and doesn't go crazy.

01:14:58.662 --> 01:15:00.332
What happened to all your friends?

01:15:00.497 --> 01:15:03.707
I don't need friends.
I don't need anyone to stop you.

01:15:05.752 --> 01:15:07.212
Are you sure about that?

01:15:07.379 --> 01:15:09.379
Look in the mirror, Batman.

01:15:10.883 --> 01:15:13.763
When I saw you working
with your friend-family,

01:15:14.553 --> 01:15:16.223
I actually thought you'd changed.

01:15:16.972 --> 01:15:18.022
But, no.

01:15:18.182 --> 01:15:19.602
You pushed them away.

01:15:23.061 --> 01:15:25.771
You've run away from every other person
in your life.

01:15:25.939 --> 01:15:28.439
But I'm the one you're always chasing.

01:15:28.609 --> 01:15:30.819
Is this about that stupid
"greatest enemy" thing?

01:15:30.986 --> 01:15:32.446
No, it's not.

01:15:33.780 --> 01:15:34.950
Not anymore.

01:15:35.115 --> 01:15:36.275
You tell him, Joker!

01:15:36.450 --> 01:15:37.700
It's time for a fresh start.

01:15:37.868 --> 01:15:38.988
<i>He's not worth it.</i>

01:15:39.161 --> 01:15:42.581
I think after 78 years,
I deserve respect!

01:15:42.748 --> 01:15:44.538
That is right. Respect!

01:15:45.125 --> 01:15:49.295
Do you realize that you have never once

01:15:49.463 --> 01:15:51.133
said the words,

01:15:51.298 --> 01:15:52.668
"I hate you, Joker"?

01:15:52.841 --> 01:15:53.931
Not once.

01:15:54.092 --> 01:15:57.222
Well, I am starting to feel
pretty annoyed with you right now.

01:15:57.387 --> 01:15:58.427
That's for darn sure.

01:15:58.597 --> 01:16:00.927
Annoyed is not the same thing!

01:16:01.642 --> 01:16:03.562
Listen, Batman.

01:16:04.102 --> 01:16:05.812
I...

01:16:05.979 --> 01:16:07.229
hate you.

01:16:07.397 --> 01:16:09.107
- Aww!
- That's nice.

01:16:09.900 --> 01:16:10.980
Now you say it.

01:16:13.153 --> 01:16:14.153
Me, too.

01:16:18.033 --> 01:16:20.493
You won't. You won't change.

01:16:20.661 --> 01:16:23.331
'Cause you can't.
You won't, and you can't.

01:16:23.497 --> 01:16:25.077
Batman will never change.

01:16:25.249 --> 01:16:27.289
You know what, boo-boo?
Just shut it down.

01:16:27.459 --> 01:16:29.499
These diseased lunatics are right.

01:16:29.670 --> 01:16:30.670
Yes, we are!

01:16:30.837 --> 01:16:33.087
I am not gonna be part

01:16:33.257 --> 01:16:35.757
of a one-sided relationship any longer!

01:16:35.926 --> 01:16:37.320
<i>- Yes!</i>
- What are you talking about?

01:16:37.344 --> 01:16:39.184
- You and I are done!
- What is wrong with you?

01:16:39.346 --> 01:16:40.346
I'm moving on!

01:16:40.514 --> 01:16:41.684
That's ridiculous.

01:16:41.848 --> 01:16:43.518
And on my way out,

01:16:43.684 --> 01:16:46.774
I'm gonna blow up Gotham City!

01:16:46.937 --> 01:16:48.727
No. You're not serious.

01:16:48.897 --> 01:16:49.977
<i>Wingardium Leviosa!</i>

01:16:50.649 --> 01:16:51.779
No!

01:16:51.942 --> 01:16:53.992
You know what?
For once, Batman, you're right.

01:16:54.152 --> 01:16:56.362
I'm not your greatest enemy.

01:16:56.530 --> 01:16:58.320
Your greatest enemy

01:16:58.490 --> 01:16:59.740
is you.

01:16:59.908 --> 01:17:02.288
<i>- Goodbye, Batman.</i>
- Wait a minute. Hold on a second.

01:17:02.452 --> 01:17:03.872
<i>Good for you, boo-boo!</i>

01:17:04.037 --> 01:17:06.367
- Yay!
- Everybody, get a bomb. Let's go.

01:17:06.540 --> 01:17:08.790
- Bomb, bomb, bomb. Let's bomb it out.
- Yay!

01:17:13.046 --> 01:17:15.166
<i>Say goodbye, Gotham City!</i>

01:17:26.351 --> 01:17:27.941
- Whoa.
<i>- Hi!</i>

01:17:28.186 --> 01:17:29.186
<i>Whoa!</i>

01:17:29.563 --> 01:17:31.063
Oh, I am so sorry.

01:17:31.231 --> 01:17:32.709
<i>It was all my fault, I keep doing that.</i>

01:17:32.733 --> 01:17:34.943
<i>Welcome to the Phantom Zone, bad guy.</i>

01:17:35.110 --> 01:17:36.360
What are you talking about?

01:17:36.528 --> 01:17:37.528
I'm not a bad guy.

01:17:37.696 --> 01:17:39.406
<i>But you're all in black.
You have a cape.</i>

01:17:39.573 --> 01:17:40.823
<i>And you wear a big, scary mask.</i>

01:17:40.991 --> 01:17:41.991
Well, I'm not.

01:17:42.159 --> 01:17:43.449
<i>And you kicked me in the face.</i>

01:17:43.618 --> 01:17:45.498
Listen, I'm Batman.

01:17:45.871 --> 01:17:47.581
<i>Oof! You even sound like a bad guy.</i>

01:17:47.748 --> 01:17:49.208
I swear, I am a good guy.

01:17:49.374 --> 01:17:51.134
<i>Okay, Mr. Batman.</i>

01:17:51.293 --> 01:17:52.963
<i>Hold still while I scan you.</i>

01:17:53.253 --> 01:17:54.923
<i>Scanning for badness.</i>

01:17:55.088 --> 01:17:56.088
<i>Yes, sir?</i>

01:17:56.256 --> 01:17:58.086
<i>- You're super nimble, right?
- I sure am!</i>

01:17:58.258 --> 01:18:00.258
<i>And 110% expendable?</i>

01:18:00.427 --> 01:18:02.217
<i>I don't know what that means, but okay.</i>

01:18:02.387 --> 01:18:03.531
<i>- How'd I do, Dad?
- Mediocre.</i>

01:18:03.555 --> 01:18:05.305
<i>- Yes!
- And don't call me Dad.</i>

01:18:05.766 --> 01:18:06.766
<i>Sorry.</i>

01:18:08.727 --> 01:18:11.267
<i>Alfred, put that kid
on the next jet to the orphanage.</i>

01:18:11.938 --> 01:18:16.188
<i>But doesn't he deserve a chance
for someone to take him under their wing,</i>

01:18:16.568 --> 01:18:19.398
<i>as I took you under mine?</i>

01:18:19.738 --> 01:18:21.618
<i>Listen, you don't have a family.</i>

01:18:21.948 --> 01:18:24.448
<i>So what do you know about
having a surrogate son?</i>

01:18:28.038 --> 01:18:29.038
<i>Batman!</i>

01:18:29.873 --> 01:18:31.963
<i>We have to stick together.</i>

01:18:32.667 --> 01:18:33.747
<i>Please.</i>

01:18:36.046 --> 01:18:39.256
<i>Joker, you mean nothing to me.</i>

01:18:41.843 --> 01:18:43.103
<i>No one does.</i>

01:18:47.057 --> 01:18:49.937
<i>Huh. You're not a traditional bad guy.</i>

01:18:50.769 --> 01:18:53.229
<i>But you're not exactly a good guy, either.</i>

01:18:53.438 --> 01:18:54.558
<i>- Batman?</i>
- Padre?

01:18:55.023 --> 01:18:56.653
<i>You even abandoned your friends.</i>

01:18:56.817 --> 01:18:57.857
What?

01:18:58.026 --> 01:18:59.436
<i>Go on, Scuttler. Go.</i>

01:18:59.611 --> 01:19:01.111
<i>- Batman, no. No!
- Don't do this!</i>

01:19:01.279 --> 01:19:02.659
Abandoned? No.

01:19:02.823 --> 01:19:04.413
No, I was trying to protect them.

01:19:04.574 --> 01:19:06.374
<i>By pushing them away?</i>

01:19:06.535 --> 01:19:07.735
Well, yeah.

01:19:08.912 --> 01:19:11.422
<i>Are they really
the ones you're protecting?</i>

01:19:14.626 --> 01:19:16.496
<i>Computer, Batman's in danger.</i>

01:19:16.670 --> 01:19:18.550
<i>Please, Computer, take us back!</i>

01:19:18.713 --> 01:19:20.913
<i>Do you really want the man
who made you to come to harm?</i>

01:19:21.007 --> 01:19:23.137
<i>Batman programmed me
to obey him.</i>

01:19:23.301 --> 01:19:25.181
<i>But he didn't say to not not rescue him.</i>

01:19:25.345 --> 01:19:26.595
What are they doing?

01:19:26.763 --> 01:19:28.063
Come on, guys. Let's hustle.

01:19:28.223 --> 01:19:30.433
Gotham City's not gonna blow itself up.

01:19:31.435 --> 01:19:33.015
<i>Well, hello!</i>

01:19:38.567 --> 01:19:40.737
'Puter, go to super-secret stealth mode.

01:19:43.989 --> 01:19:45.739
- Hold on!
- No!

01:19:45.907 --> 01:19:49.367
Evil buddies, those are my last three
painful reminders of Batman.

01:19:49.536 --> 01:19:50.906
Run!

01:19:51.079 --> 01:19:52.369
Come on, Alfred. This way.

01:19:52.539 --> 01:19:53.789
Wait, where's Dick?

01:19:53.957 --> 01:19:55.237
<i>The little guy? He's over there.</i>

01:19:55.292 --> 01:19:56.727
<i>Initializing Batcave
operating system.</i>

01:19:56.751 --> 01:19:58.041
What's he doing?

01:19:58.211 --> 01:19:59.711
<i>I've gotta save my family!</i>

01:19:59.880 --> 01:20:00.880
Just think.

01:20:01.047 --> 01:20:03.047
- What would Batman do?
- What?

01:20:03.216 --> 01:20:06.136
I know. Not listen to anyone else.
Be mean to people.

01:20:06.386 --> 01:20:08.046
Destroy as much property as possible.

01:20:08.221 --> 01:20:10.221
Talk in a really low, gravelly voice.

01:20:10.390 --> 01:20:11.890
And go it alone.

01:20:12.058 --> 01:20:13.188
Kid, don't do that.

01:20:13.393 --> 01:20:14.773
<i>Atomic batteries to power.</i>

01:20:14.936 --> 01:20:15.936
<i>Turbines to speed.</i>

01:20:16.104 --> 01:20:17.114
Don't do what I would do!

01:20:17.272 --> 01:20:18.752
<i>I never even taught you how to drive!</i>

01:20:18.899 --> 01:20:20.649
Hold on a second, Brick Lady.

01:20:20.817 --> 01:20:23.107
I'm so sorry.
I need to get down there and stop this.

01:20:23.278 --> 01:20:25.818
<i>I can't let you go.
My boss will be really mad at me.</i>

01:20:25.989 --> 01:20:27.549
Yeah. But I bet
your boss would be happy

01:20:27.657 --> 01:20:29.857
if you were able to get
all those bad guys back in here.

01:20:29.951 --> 01:20:31.241
<i>Hmm. She sure would.</i>

01:20:31.411 --> 01:20:33.751
Then let me try.
Let me get down there and help them.

01:20:33.914 --> 01:20:35.874
<i>But haven't you tried that before?</i>

01:20:37.501 --> 01:20:38.921
<i>This way, Alfred.</i>

01:20:40.420 --> 01:20:43.050
<i>You do the same thing over and over.</i>

01:20:47.093 --> 01:20:48.553
<i>What's gonna change?</i>

01:20:48.720 --> 01:20:49.760
<i>No!</i>

01:20:51.640 --> 01:20:53.480
I know what I need to do.

01:20:53.642 --> 01:20:55.942
Just give me 24 hours,
and I'll come back.

01:20:56.811 --> 01:20:58.271
Whoa!

01:20:58.438 --> 01:21:00.318
You've gotta let me go
down there and save them.

01:21:02.859 --> 01:21:03.899
I'll do whatever you want.

01:21:05.195 --> 01:21:07.315
- Please.
<i>- Exterminate!</i>

01:21:07.489 --> 01:21:08.489
Please.

01:21:08.657 --> 01:21:10.697
<i>Okay, but I need all the bad guys
locked up in here.</i>

01:21:10.742 --> 01:21:11.952
I promise.

01:21:14.454 --> 01:21:16.624
<i>And I mean all of them.</i>

01:21:18.124 --> 01:21:19.844
One of these buttons
has to save my friends.

01:21:20.460 --> 01:21:21.620
<i>Self-destruct mode activated.</i>

01:21:21.670 --> 01:21:22.670
Self what?

01:21:24.047 --> 01:21:25.757
- Master Dick!
- No!

01:21:28.134 --> 01:21:29.764
Dick!

01:21:29.928 --> 01:21:31.718
Look who's bat!

01:21:33.348 --> 01:21:34.808
What?

01:21:43.149 --> 01:21:45.649
Everyone okay? Dick, Alfred, Barbara.

01:21:45.819 --> 01:21:47.819
<i>- Are you guys...</i>
- We're fine, Batman.

01:21:50.574 --> 01:21:53.834
Listen, I just wanted to say

01:21:56.663 --> 01:21:58.333
that I'm really,

01:21:59.416 --> 01:22:01.666
really, really,

01:22:03.295 --> 01:22:04.835
really, really, really,

01:22:05.005 --> 01:22:06.335
really, really...

01:22:07.507 --> 01:22:09.047
s-s-s...

01:22:12.345 --> 01:22:15.265
Soooo...

01:22:16.725 --> 01:22:17.725
Sorry?

01:22:17.892 --> 01:22:19.942
Yeah. Whoo! I did it!

01:22:23.064 --> 01:22:25.324
I don't even know why
you bothered coming back.

01:22:28.194 --> 01:22:29.824
<i>I was</i>

01:22:30.697 --> 01:22:31.697
<i>afraid.</i>

01:22:32.657 --> 01:22:33.827
What?

01:22:35.702 --> 01:22:37.542
The reason I came back

01:22:38.204 --> 01:22:40.044
was the same reason I left you.

01:22:43.043 --> 01:22:44.713
I was afraid

01:22:46.171 --> 01:22:47.761
of feeling

01:22:49.007 --> 01:22:51.377
the pain you feel

01:22:52.886 --> 01:22:54.546
when you lose

01:22:55.722 --> 01:22:58.142
someone close to you.

01:23:06.024 --> 01:23:08.074
Gotham needs us.

01:23:08.610 --> 01:23:11.740
So I came back to do this.

01:23:12.322 --> 01:23:13.322
Flip.

01:23:14.949 --> 01:23:16.789
Flip? What is that? I don't...

01:23:17.160 --> 01:23:18.500
You gotta turn around.

01:23:20.497 --> 01:23:23.037
<i>I call it the Babs-Signal.</i>

01:23:23.208 --> 01:23:25.708
<i>And I'm flipping the switch for you.</i>

01:23:25.877 --> 01:23:29.917
Because saving this city
is too big a job for one person.

01:23:30.090 --> 01:23:31.590
Flip, flip.

01:23:36.429 --> 01:23:38.769
<i>So, what do you say, Commish?</i>

01:23:38.932 --> 01:23:41.562
Will you work with me?

01:23:42.102 --> 01:23:43.852
I need your help.

01:23:45.271 --> 01:23:47.111
I thought you'd never ask.

01:23:48.608 --> 01:23:51.238
I'm very, very proud of you, sir.

01:23:51.403 --> 01:23:55.573
But there's still only four of us
against Joker's entire army.

01:23:55.740 --> 01:23:57.740
That's why I called in some backup.

01:23:57.909 --> 01:23:59.909
Flip! Flip! Flip! Flip!

01:24:01.246 --> 01:24:03.326
- Whoa!
- We saw your signal,

01:24:03.540 --> 01:24:04.540
and we came to help.

01:24:04.958 --> 01:24:07.588
Joker may be done with us,
but we're not done with him.

01:24:07.752 --> 01:24:09.962
We will be the Joker's reckoning.

01:24:10.130 --> 01:24:12.090
Joker said mean stuff to us.

01:24:12.465 --> 01:24:14.085
You were right, Barbara.

01:24:14.259 --> 01:24:16.969
It takes a village. Not a Batman.

01:24:19.556 --> 01:24:21.466
Okay. Everybody, listen up.

01:24:21.641 --> 01:24:25.311
<i>These monsters want to destroy
Gotham City.</i>

01:24:25.478 --> 01:24:27.648
<i>That's right.
We need sick new vehicles.</i>

01:24:27.814 --> 01:24:29.774
<i>An arsenal of advanced weaponry.</i>

01:24:29.941 --> 01:24:32.491
Costumes that suit
our individual personalities.

01:24:32.652 --> 01:24:33.652
Rip!

01:24:33.820 --> 01:24:35.910
And code names
to use on our walkie-talkies.

01:24:36.072 --> 01:24:37.072
Call it out!

01:24:37.240 --> 01:24:38.530
Your name is Lady Bat.

01:24:38.700 --> 01:24:39.780
- Lady Bat?
<i>- Bat Lady.</i>

01:24:39.951 --> 01:24:42.831
- Veto! Nope. What?
<i>- El Batarina. Soccer Mom... Bat?</i>

01:24:43.037 --> 01:24:44.657
How about a cool costume?

01:24:44.831 --> 01:24:45.831
Nice!

01:24:45.999 --> 01:24:47.379
That one's called Batgirl.

01:24:47.542 --> 01:24:49.632
If you call me Batgirl,
can I call you Batboy?

01:24:49.794 --> 01:24:52.304
And lastly, a coordinated attack strategy,

01:24:52.464 --> 01:24:54.014
and a kick-butt theme song!

01:24:54.174 --> 01:24:55.184
Robin?

01:24:55.800 --> 01:24:57.470
My superhero code name.

01:24:57.635 --> 01:24:58.885
Oh, yeah. Hit it!

01:24:59.053 --> 01:25:00.053
Got it!

01:25:02.182 --> 01:25:04.432
No!

01:25:07.771 --> 01:25:08.811
Absolutely not.

01:25:11.816 --> 01:25:14.936
This music is filling me with rage.

01:25:15.111 --> 01:25:16.491
Let's use it!

01:25:17.947 --> 01:25:20.217
All right, team. I'm going to need to
know your special powers.

01:25:20.241 --> 01:25:21.241
I'm a giant clay person!

01:25:21.409 --> 01:25:23.169
- I'm irritating.
- I have a sack for a face.

01:25:23.244 --> 01:25:24.472
I make unpredictable decisions.

01:25:24.496 --> 01:25:25.496
I raise the stakes!

01:25:25.663 --> 01:25:26.963
I can squirt ketchup!

01:25:27.123 --> 01:25:28.543
Nice! Orca.

01:25:28.708 --> 01:25:30.288
I'm a whale!

01:25:30.460 --> 01:25:31.920
Oh, we got this covered!

01:25:32.086 --> 01:25:33.126
<i>Go team!</i>

01:25:35.965 --> 01:25:36.965
Whale, yeah!

01:25:40.178 --> 01:25:41.928
Shh. Quiet.

01:25:42.096 --> 01:25:44.136
Who's laying down those funky beats?

01:25:44.307 --> 01:25:46.387
<i>- We are!
- Meow, meow!</i>

01:25:46.559 --> 01:25:47.889
Batman?

01:25:48.061 --> 01:25:49.811
Evil army, get rid of them!

01:25:50.688 --> 01:25:52.188
Team Gotham Family,

01:25:52.357 --> 01:25:53.437
<i>activate!</i>

01:25:53.608 --> 01:25:54.728
Voldy's got this.

01:25:57.111 --> 01:25:58.781
Here we go!

01:25:59.364 --> 01:26:00.704
Yeah!

01:26:02.075 --> 01:26:03.445
<i>Bombarda!</i>

01:26:04.160 --> 01:26:05.500
Smash! Smash! Smash!

01:26:08.331 --> 01:26:11.131
- Whoa.
- Batman, take out Joker's bomb.

01:26:11.292 --> 01:26:12.922
I'll get that Projector!

01:26:13.086 --> 01:26:14.246
<i>10-4, Co-Go.</i>

01:26:15.463 --> 01:26:17.513
Freeze, Clayface, take this guy out!

01:26:17.924 --> 01:26:19.804
Coming through!

01:26:24.264 --> 01:26:25.814
Okay, Alfred, bring the pain.

01:26:27.767 --> 01:26:30.767
Bringing it, sir. For Queen and country!

01:26:32.647 --> 01:26:34.107
You just got Union Jacked!

01:26:36.776 --> 01:26:37.856
Robin, get ready.

01:26:38.027 --> 01:26:39.947
I'm about to teach you
some father-and-son stuff.

01:26:40.780 --> 01:26:42.120
First, driving.

01:26:42.282 --> 01:26:44.122
- Put your hands at 10 and 2.
- Okay.

01:26:44.284 --> 01:26:46.874
Now, fly! Turn left!

01:26:47.704 --> 01:26:49.084
Run over these skeletons.

01:26:49.247 --> 01:26:50.617
Now drive up the wall!

01:26:52.083 --> 01:26:53.963
- Great driving.
- Thanks, <i>Padre.</i>

01:26:55.461 --> 01:26:56.461
Yeah!

01:26:57.630 --> 01:26:58.670
Okay, Robin.

01:26:58.840 --> 01:27:00.970
Together, we're gonna
punch these guys so hard,

01:27:01.134 --> 01:27:02.644
words describing the impact

01:27:02.802 --> 01:27:05.642
are gonna spontaneously materialize
out of thin air.

01:27:05.805 --> 01:27:06.885
Yeah!

01:27:12.186 --> 01:27:13.516
Yes! Yes! Yes!

01:27:17.275 --> 01:27:18.275
High five!

01:27:18.568 --> 01:27:20.698
Stop moving around, you Muggles.

01:27:20.904 --> 01:27:23.034
All right, team, let's shut him down.

01:27:23.740 --> 01:27:25.780
Orca! You're up, baby!

01:27:26.367 --> 01:27:28.197
You wanna see a magic trick?

01:27:28.369 --> 01:27:30.159
I'm gonna make you disappear.

01:27:30.330 --> 01:27:33.080
<i>- Wingardium Levio...</i>
- Me-yoink!

01:27:33.249 --> 01:27:35.169
<i>Wingardium Levio...</i> Shut up!

01:27:35.335 --> 01:27:36.335
No!

<i>Welcome to the Phantom Zone, bad guy!</i>

01:27:38.338 --> 01:27:39.338
Fudgecake!

01:27:40.173 --> 01:27:41.673
<i>Whoo!
Here we go, Bat Team!</i>

01:27:41.841 --> 01:27:43.181
Batman, think fast!

01:27:46.346 --> 01:27:48.056
<i>Welcome to the Phantom Zone, bad guy!</i>

01:27:48.222 --> 01:27:49.222
Robin, go long.

01:27:49.390 --> 01:27:51.270
<i>- Nice grab.</i>
- Yeah!

01:27:53.311 --> 01:27:55.061
<i>Oh, my gosh. Yes!</i>

01:27:55.229 --> 01:27:56.229
Here you go, Grandpa.

01:27:58.274 --> 01:27:59.284
Hey, Batman!

01:28:02.862 --> 01:28:04.782
Get off my <i>padre!</i>

01:28:06.074 --> 01:28:07.874
It wasn't useless after all.

01:28:08.034 --> 01:28:09.704
End this, Batgirl!

01:28:12.246 --> 01:28:14.166
<i>Adiós,</i> shark.

01:28:15.750 --> 01:28:17.920
Okay, BRB, guys.
I'm gonna go defuse that...

01:28:31.599 --> 01:28:33.269
This is the end of Gotham City!

01:28:34.560 --> 01:28:36.980
<i>As I predicted, we're doomed!</i>

01:28:38.356 --> 01:28:40.016
We're not doomed. I got this.

01:28:41.567 --> 01:28:42.817
Everyone, grab on to me.

01:28:42.986 --> 01:28:44.106
Gotcha.

01:28:44.278 --> 01:28:46.858
Come on, guys.
We need to hold this city together.

01:28:49.367 --> 01:28:50.617
Batrope, no!

01:28:50.785 --> 01:28:52.405
Everybody, run!

01:28:52.578 --> 01:28:54.578
No! We have to stick together.

01:28:54.747 --> 01:28:55.747
Right, Batman?

01:28:55.915 --> 01:28:57.245
We need to use our heads!

01:28:57.417 --> 01:28:59.057
Maybe we should build something together.

01:28:59.085 --> 01:29:00.245
<i>- Heads.
- Stick together.</i>

01:29:00.420 --> 01:29:02.260
<i>- Build something.
- Together.</i>

01:29:02.422 --> 01:29:04.422
- <i>Build.
- Together. Together.</i>

01:29:04.590 --> 01:29:06.050
<i>We should build something together.</i>

01:29:07.427 --> 01:29:08.467
I got it.

01:29:08.636 --> 01:29:11.556
You're right, Babs.
We need to stick together.

01:29:11.723 --> 01:29:13.063
Literally.

01:29:13.224 --> 01:29:14.434
Robin, quick. Give me a boost.

01:29:14.600 --> 01:29:15.600
On it, <i>Padre.</i>

01:29:15.768 --> 01:29:17.808
We're gonna stick together,
using our heads,

01:29:17.979 --> 01:29:20.359
and the most powerful weapon of all.

01:29:20.523 --> 01:29:22.943
Shredded abs. Let's do this.

01:29:23.109 --> 01:29:24.503
- Meow, meow.
- Yeah, let's do this.

01:29:24.527 --> 01:29:25.737
- Ready?
- Here we go.

01:29:25.903 --> 01:29:26.953
You got this, Alfred?

01:29:27.113 --> 01:29:28.873
Yes, sir. Abs of steel.

01:29:29.032 --> 01:29:31.122
Great! Now you bend,

01:29:31.284 --> 01:29:33.414
and I'll grab the other side!

01:29:34.328 --> 01:29:35.368
No!

01:29:35.538 --> 01:29:37.178
<i>- Batman, what's going on?
- Are you okay?</i>

01:29:37.790 --> 01:29:39.250
I've got you.

01:29:41.669 --> 01:29:42.669
Joker!

01:29:42.837 --> 01:29:44.837
<i>Please, help us!</i>

01:29:45.006 --> 01:29:46.626
No! I'm not gonna help you.

01:29:46.799 --> 01:29:50.549
At least if this city is destroyed,
I'll die knowing

01:29:50.720 --> 01:29:52.470
I'm your greatest enemy!

01:29:52.638 --> 01:29:54.678
I'm gonna have to die to know it.

01:29:54.849 --> 01:29:57.889
Shut up, Joker! If there's no Gotham,

01:29:58.061 --> 01:30:00.191
then I'll never get to fight you again.

01:30:01.314 --> 01:30:02.614
What?

01:30:03.483 --> 01:30:05.903
You're the reason why I get up
at 4:00 in the afternoon

01:30:06.069 --> 01:30:08.609
and pump iron
until my chest is positively sick.

01:30:09.197 --> 01:30:10.487
<i>You're the reason I've given up</i>

01:30:10.656 --> 01:30:13.826
<i>a life spent with Russian ballerinas
and lady activewear models.</i>

01:30:14.452 --> 01:30:15.832
And if it wasn't for you,

01:30:15.995 --> 01:30:19.245
I never would have learned how connected
I am with all these people.

01:30:20.249 --> 01:30:21.249
And you.

01:30:23.044 --> 01:30:25.554
<i>So if you help me save Gotham,</i>

01:30:27.799 --> 01:30:29.589
you'll help me save us.

01:30:30.593 --> 01:30:32.893
You just said "us."

01:30:33.054 --> 01:30:37.144
Yeah. Batman and the Joker.

01:30:38.976 --> 01:30:40.646
<i>What do you say?</i>

01:30:41.479 --> 01:30:43.479
You had me at shut up.

01:30:45.358 --> 01:30:46.648
How are your abs, bro?

01:30:46.818 --> 01:30:50.028
Too much flab, not enough ab.
Why?

01:30:50.196 --> 01:30:51.946
Because I need you to crunch them.

01:30:52.323 --> 01:30:53.743
<i>Citizens of Gotham,</i>

01:30:53.908 --> 01:30:58.698
<i>we need all of you to join us
and help bring this city back together.</i>

01:31:24.897 --> 01:31:27.067
I'm just gonna come right out and say it.

01:31:27.233 --> 01:31:29.533
I hate you, Joker.

01:31:29.777 --> 01:31:31.647
- I hate you, too.
- I hate you more.

01:31:31.821 --> 01:31:33.571
I hate you the most.

01:31:33.739 --> 01:31:35.529
I hate you forever.

01:31:36.075 --> 01:31:37.115
Splendid!

01:31:38.786 --> 01:31:39.946
We did it, everyone!

01:31:44.750 --> 01:31:47.000
Bane is feeling warm and fuzzy.

01:31:52.049 --> 01:31:53.089
Padre,

01:31:53.926 --> 01:31:55.006
where are you going?

01:31:56.137 --> 01:31:57.757
I made a promise.

01:31:57.930 --> 01:31:59.850
I gotta go back to the Phantom Zone.

01:32:00.892 --> 01:32:01.982
<i>Sorry, kid.</i>

01:32:02.143 --> 01:32:04.103
<i>Padre,</i> please.

01:32:04.270 --> 01:32:06.270
Don't call me <i>Padre.</i>

01:32:06.772 --> 01:32:08.192
Okay.

01:32:08.774 --> 01:32:09.864
Call me...

01:32:13.905 --> 01:32:15.065
Dads.

01:32:15.323 --> 01:32:18.993
My two dads are the same dad.

01:32:20.077 --> 01:32:22.787
But they're both leaving.

01:32:23.956 --> 01:32:25.576
It's gonna be okay, kid.

01:32:27.168 --> 01:32:29.668
Sometimes, losing people is part of life.

01:32:30.504 --> 01:32:33.474
But that doesn't mean
you stop letting them in.

01:32:34.175 --> 01:32:37.135
<i>Some very wise people taught me that.</i>

01:32:37.970 --> 01:32:39.470
<i>My father figure.</i>

01:32:41.015 --> 01:32:43.515
<i>My platonic coworker buddy,</i>

01:32:43.684 --> 01:32:46.314
<i>who's a girl, but just a friend.</i>

01:32:47.939 --> 01:32:49.149
<i>And you.</i>

01:32:49.941 --> 01:32:51.281
Mi hijo.

01:32:51.984 --> 01:32:53.324
<i>It's Spanish</i>

01:32:54.111 --> 01:32:55.491
<i>for "son."</i>

01:32:57.615 --> 01:32:59.365
This is my family,

01:33:00.618 --> 01:33:02.498
but it's your family, too.

01:34:06.892 --> 01:34:08.142
Do you have a knife?

01:34:08.311 --> 01:34:09.311
Why?

01:34:09.478 --> 01:34:13.018
'Cause someone needs to cut the tension
between the two of us immediately.

01:34:14.358 --> 01:34:15.858
Okay. I deserved that.

01:34:16.027 --> 01:34:17.397
<i>- Hi.</i>
- Wait a minute.

01:34:17.570 --> 01:34:18.610
What's going on?

01:34:18.779 --> 01:34:21.119
I came back, just like I said I would.

01:34:21.282 --> 01:34:22.912
<i>You know, Mr. Batman,</i>

01:34:23.075 --> 01:34:25.575
<i>when you're a talking brick,
working at the Phantom Zone,</i>

01:34:25.745 --> 01:34:28.245
<i>you see a lot of crazy things.</i>

01:34:28.414 --> 01:34:30.584
<i>But I've finally seen a man,</i>

01:34:30.750 --> 01:34:32.590
<i>in order to make the world
a better place,</i>

01:34:32.752 --> 01:34:35.252
<i>take a look at himself
and make a change.</i>

01:34:36.255 --> 01:34:37.255
Who?

01:34:37.631 --> 01:34:39.551
<i>- Superman.</i>
- What?

01:34:39.717 --> 01:34:40.967
<i>I'm kidding. It's you.</i>

01:34:44.430 --> 01:34:46.770
Well, I guess I'll be seeing you
on the streets, Batman.

01:34:46.932 --> 01:34:48.932
I guess so. Catch you later, Joker.

01:34:49.101 --> 01:34:50.231
Let's go, gang.

01:34:50.394 --> 01:34:51.444
Wait a minute,

01:34:51.812 --> 01:34:53.942
we're not just gonna
let these criminals go, right?

01:34:54.106 --> 01:34:55.606
Ah, come on, Commish. Let's face it.

01:34:55.775 --> 01:34:57.735
Those guys are no match
for the four of us.

01:34:57.902 --> 01:34:59.572
We'll give them a 30-minute head start.

01:34:59.737 --> 01:35:02.277
Besides, you can't fight crime
on an empty stomach.

01:35:05.284 --> 01:35:06.454
Hey, Computer?

01:35:06.619 --> 01:35:07.829
We're home!

01:35:11.457 --> 01:35:12.627
<i>What is the password?</i>

01:35:12.792 --> 01:35:14.462
Iron Man sucks!

01:35:26.597 --> 01:35:29.477
When Dad and me were fighting,
I was giving them my best one-liners.

01:35:30.309 --> 01:35:31.309
<i>You</i>

01:35:33.437 --> 01:35:34.767
<i>complete me.</i>

01:35:48.327 --> 01:35:51.367
Holy family photo, Batman. I love it!

01:35:58.337 --> 01:35:59.507
<i>White.</i>

01:35:59.672 --> 01:36:03.842
<i>All important movies end
with a white screen.</i>

01:36:04.343 --> 01:36:06.473
<i>And tying up loose ends.</i>

01:36:06.637 --> 01:36:08.677
We're coming for you, Gotham City!

01:36:08.848 --> 01:36:10.348
<i>Like this snake clowns bit.</i>

01:36:10.516 --> 01:36:12.476
<i>- Snake clowns?
- Told you they were real.</i>

01:36:12.643 --> 01:36:14.853
<i>Did you stick wigs onto snakes?</i>

01:36:15.020 --> 01:36:16.690
<i>- Maybe.
- That is so weird.</i>

01:36:16.981 --> 01:36:18.750
<i>Can I play that song
I wrote for the end credits?</i>

01:36:18.774 --> 01:36:20.054
<i>- That is a hard pass.
- Come on.</i>

01:36:20.109 --> 01:36:21.109
<i>No!</i>

01:36:21.318 --> 01:36:22.796
<i>Let the kid play
whatever music he wants.</i>

01:36:22.820 --> 01:36:23.820
<i>- No, no, no!
- Please?</i>

01:36:24.029 --> 01:36:25.029
<i>- No.</i>
- Padre?

01:36:25.364 --> 01:36:26.874
<i>Fine. 'Puter.</i>

01:36:27.450 --> 01:36:28.450
<i>Okay, sir.</i>

01:36:28.617 --> 01:36:29.947
<i>Yay!</i>

01:36:30.202 --> 01:36:32.502
<i>Now playing
Robin's happy, poppy music.</i>

01:36:32.663 --> 01:36:35.883
<i>The kind that makes
parents and studio executives happy.</i>

01:36:59.899 --> 01:37:00.899
Come on, everyone!

01:37:20.294 --> 01:37:21.634
- Come on, Batman!
- No!

01:38:48.048 --> 01:38:51.388
<i>Wow, that was fun!</i>

01:38:51.552 --> 01:38:53.932
<i>Really hope nobody was recording that.</i>

01:38:54.096 --> 01:38:56.676
Let me see. Oh, this thing is on.
This thing is recording.
